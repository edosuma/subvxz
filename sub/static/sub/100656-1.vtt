WEBVTT

00:46.538 --> 00:48.238
Now we're ready.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.536
Do you have family here?

01:18.370 --> 01:20.270
No.

01:20.272 --> 01:21.908
You have a place to stay?

01:26.411 --> 01:27.680
Where is your family then?

01:29.816 --> 01:32.384
- Back in India.
- Uh-huh.

01:37.056 --> 01:38.725
Don't you worry, my dear.

01:40.525 --> 01:45.462
I know what it's like to be
in your shoes, starting over.

01:45.464 --> 01:47.934
I left everybody behind,
just like you.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.470
You work hard, you make it here.

01:53.472 --> 01:54.772
You believe that?

01:54.774 --> 01:55.775
Yes.

02:02.314 --> 02:04.347
Is this real?

02:04.349 --> 02:05.818
Uh-huh.

02:06.786 --> 02:09.352
So some ground rules.

02:09.354 --> 02:12.522
No stealing, no drugs,
no prostitution.

02:12.524 --> 02:14.658
I run an honest establishment.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.028
We're all family here.

02:17.395 --> 02:18.829
I want to make an honest living.

02:18.831 --> 02:20.032
Good.

02:22.835 --> 02:25.035
- My passport.
- No, this?

02:25.037 --> 02:28.404
No, I think I will, uh,
keep this in my safe

02:28.406 --> 02:30.542
until we get you a new one.

02:31.110 --> 02:32.577
An American one.

02:35.047 --> 02:37.683
Maybe one day you'll be
running this place, huh?

02:42.755 --> 02:45.823
There used to be a pool,
we had to take it out.

02:45.825 --> 02:47.459
That was a shame.

02:49.729 --> 02:52.997
Here is the laundry room.

02:52.999 --> 02:55.400
You'll be spending
a lot of your time in there.

03:02.141 --> 03:05.575
Hey, kids,
is this your pizza box here?

03:05.577 --> 03:07.713
You gotta pick that up.
That doesn't look so good, huh?

03:10.917 --> 03:13.083
I let them stay here.

03:13.085 --> 03:15.920
Their mother's an addict,
it's very sad.

03:15.922 --> 03:17.589
I got a big heart.

03:29.836 --> 03:32.370
This is Riz, she just got here.

03:34.674 --> 03:37.310
That's okay. That's okay.
Come, come, come.

03:39.912 --> 03:43.080
We've got a plaza room
down here.

03:43.082 --> 03:45.582
Some of the people
have services on Sundays.

03:45.584 --> 03:47.687
If that interests you,
you can do that.

03:49.956 --> 03:53.891
Good evening. We have, uh,
karaoke on Monday nights.

03:53.893 --> 03:56.060
You like singing?

03:56.062 --> 03:59.397
Oh, you have to come to karaoke,
everybody does.

04:02.702 --> 04:04.567
Excuse me just one moment.

04:04.569 --> 04:05.905
Sal!

05:08.234 --> 05:10.533
Who the fuck are you?

05:10.535 --> 05:12.138
She said I stay here.

05:13.571 --> 05:15.706
God!

05:15.708 --> 05:17.573
That pathetic bitch.

05:17.575 --> 05:19.211
What are you,
like, Mexican or something?

05:24.984 --> 05:26.852
Oh, shit.

05:45.805 --> 05:49.039
Fine, you can stay.

05:49.041 --> 05:51.444
Just stop being
such a little creep, okay?

06:21.040 --> 06:22.607
What the fuck is this?

06:27.246 --> 06:29.081
What is this?

06:29.949 --> 06:32.118
What's this? Useless.

06:38.991 --> 06:41.027
What is this?

06:42.028 --> 06:43.929
It doesn't even look real.

06:48.801 --> 06:50.169
Earn it back.

06:52.238 --> 06:53.937
What?

06:53.939 --> 06:55.072
Steal something
from some of the rooms

06:55.074 --> 06:57.209
and I'll give your shit back.

07:01.313 --> 07:02.915
I'm not stealing.

07:04.116 --> 07:07.117
Listen, Ms. Goody Goody.

07:07.119 --> 07:09.353
I've been saving
to get out of this dump

07:09.355 --> 07:11.023
and you're gonna help me.

09:26.192 --> 09:29.259
I was just
finishing up everything.

09:29.261 --> 09:31.096
No, you can take as much time
as you want.

09:32.898 --> 09:34.733
Excuse me.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.269
Excuse me.

09:40.472 --> 09:41.941
Wait, what about the vacuum?

09:43.142 --> 09:44.508
Here.

09:44.510 --> 09:46.312
Here you go.

09:49.782 --> 09:51.917
I can do it.

09:59.158 --> 10:00.359
From India?

10:10.102 --> 10:12.071
No, thank you.

10:16.508 --> 10:18.510
I can do it. Thank you.

10:19.845 --> 10:21.046
Thank you.

10:21.947 --> 10:23.415
Hey.

10:24.016 --> 10:26.151
Oh. Here.

10:32.124 --> 10:33.392
One sec, huh.

10:54.580 --> 10:56.248
Hey...

11:45.064 --> 11:48.267
D-A-L-L-A-S.

12:35.214 --> 12:37.249
I need my things first.

12:44.156 --> 12:46.058
A deal is a deal.

12:57.302 --> 12:59.037
Come to mama.

13:06.713 --> 13:11.016
♪ Four little
kitties in a row ♪

13:19.291 --> 13:21.260
- You want some?
- No.

13:27.232 --> 13:29.101
You've never done it before,
have you?

13:46.251 --> 13:47.484
Fuck!

13:49.288 --> 13:51.490
Where the fuck is it?

14:07.807 --> 14:10.042
Sal.

14:12.110 --> 14:14.478
Sal, what the fuck is going on?

14:14.480 --> 14:16.246
My phone is ringing off the hook
with complaints

14:16.248 --> 14:18.083
about the noise in this room.

14:20.586 --> 14:23.220
- I can't fucking find it.
- All right, calm down.

14:23.222 --> 14:24.289
What's the matter?

14:26.592 --> 14:30.427
I bet you're in on it,
aren't you?

14:30.429 --> 14:32.295
You fucking stole it,
didn't you?

14:32.297 --> 14:34.364
- You lying bitch!
- Sal!

14:34.366 --> 14:36.168
You don't talk to me like that.

14:38.504 --> 14:42.138
We have an arrangement, 30-70.

14:42.140 --> 14:44.074
You think
I'm gonna steal it from you?

14:44.076 --> 14:46.343
What's going on?

14:46.345 --> 14:49.448
- It's gone.
- What?

14:53.285 --> 14:55.220
The whole brick.

15:00.693 --> 15:03.295
Una, I need to get it back.

15:05.798 --> 15:07.230
Someone fucking stole it.

15:07.232 --> 15:08.866
Who?

15:08.868 --> 15:10.567
I don't know who.

15:10.569 --> 15:12.805
- Who do you think?
- I don't know who.

15:17.276 --> 15:18.778
Oh, what the fuck?

15:21.446 --> 15:23.181
Piece of shit.

15:36.796 --> 15:38.829
Maybe it was
one of the cleaning girls.

15:38.831 --> 15:40.265
Which one?

15:41.333 --> 15:43.166
The blonde one.

15:43.168 --> 15:44.503
Dallas?

15:46.572 --> 15:48.673
Yeah?

15:48.675 --> 15:50.442
- Yeah.
- Maybe. Crackhead.

15:53.813 --> 15:58.381
Okay. So you go find her,
you figure it out.

15:58.383 --> 16:01.318
But you keep it down.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.723
We don't want the police
here again, hmm?

16:12.197 --> 16:13.833
Take it.

16:15.300 --> 16:18.736
I don't want it.

16:18.738 --> 16:21.438
Yeah, well, sometimes you gotta
be bad in order to be good.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.474
Don't you think?

16:27.780 --> 16:29.914
How do you say
sister-fucker?

16:29.916 --> 16:31.649
- Behnchod.
- Banchode.

16:31.651 --> 16:34.284
- Behnchod.
- Banchode.

16:34.286 --> 16:35.452
- Yeah, something like that.
- That's sister-fucker?

16:35.454 --> 16:36.823
Yes, sister-fucker.

16:38.323 --> 16:39.556
What are you having?

16:39.558 --> 16:41.524
A vanilla milkshake.

16:41.526 --> 16:44.227
A vanilla milkshake?

16:44.229 --> 16:45.798
Are you, like,
twelve or something?

16:49.769 --> 16:51.969
Wanna hear my list
of nail-salon ideas?

16:51.971 --> 16:56.539
We got Nail Me Right,
Divalicious

16:56.541 --> 16:59.344
Diva Nails, Diva Dallas,
Diva Dolly.

17:00.713 --> 17:02.713
But I'm not.

17:02.715 --> 17:04.648
Actually, we should do
your nails tonight.

17:04.651 --> 17:07.483
Like, shape 'em up real nice,
maybe do something like mine?

17:07.486 --> 17:08.550
What can I get you?

17:08.553 --> 17:11.488
Doreen.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.858
- It's a lovely name, Doreen.
- What can I get you?

17:13.859 --> 17:16.494
Um, we would like
two vanilla milkshakes, please.

17:25.771 --> 17:28.338
I was serious about that
nail salon, though, you know?

17:28.339 --> 17:30.841
- I'm gonna do it.
- Here?

17:30.843 --> 17:33.878
In this dump? Fuck, no.

17:33.880 --> 17:37.447
I'm getting the hell out.
Una can fuck off.

17:37.449 --> 17:39.950
- Why don't you just leave?
- Are you serious?

17:39.952 --> 17:43.386
Do you think I would last
a day out there without money?

17:43.388 --> 17:45.524
I got a whole strategy up here,
you know?

17:46.626 --> 17:48.626
She probably pays for sex,
you know?

17:48.628 --> 17:49.762
Like, who would wanna fuck her?

17:51.263 --> 17:53.631
Listen, maybe you can help me.

17:53.633 --> 17:56.667
I saw what you did, stealing.

17:56.669 --> 17:58.971
Opening suitcases,
God knows what else.

17:59.806 --> 18:01.406
You're sneaky, Riz.

18:03.710 --> 18:06.342
Look, Jimmy and I,
we got a plan.

18:06.344 --> 18:07.845
Okay, we score extra dough
on the side.

18:07.847 --> 18:10.582
- Odd jobs, simple, easy stuff.
- Like drugs?

18:15.287 --> 18:17.587
We're gonna hold up
that bitch Una.

18:17.589 --> 18:19.355
I'm not doing anything criminal.

18:19.357 --> 18:20.760
Are you calling me a criminal?

18:22.561 --> 18:25.330
I need to use the washroom.

18:28.835 --> 18:31.003
Doreen!

18:34.707 --> 18:36.709
Thank you.

19:26.793 --> 19:28.759
Try the cream on top.
Try the top.

19:28.761 --> 19:30.995
- Yeah.
- Try the top, yeah.

19:30.997 --> 19:32.765
It's my favorite bit.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.401
It's nice.

19:37.970 --> 19:39.504
Fuck, yeah.

19:45.878 --> 19:49.046
I'm vomiting and I'm like,
yakking up these mushrooms.

19:49.048 --> 19:52.016
But then in the vomit
I could see maggots.

19:52.018 --> 19:55.485
So I'm like, "Do I vomit,
do I not?" It was pretty scary.

20:13.405 --> 20:14.941
Wanna lie down?

20:17.910 --> 20:19.877
You okay, honey?

20:19.879 --> 20:21.681
I feel great.

20:55.447 --> 20:57.549
Oh, fuck the birds.

21:07.693 --> 21:09.226
So you're wearing
nail polish now?

21:09.228 --> 21:12.129
Huh? Oh, this?

21:12.131 --> 21:14.064
What's that, gel?

21:14.066 --> 21:15.633
I don't know. Is that the shit
that doesn't come off?

21:15.635 --> 21:17.770
Let me see. It's gel.

21:21.107 --> 21:23.908
Speak of the devil.

21:23.910 --> 21:25.745
Peaches, this is the diva
behind the nails.

21:32.617 --> 21:34.586
- Classy gel work.
- Thanks, ladybug.

21:36.756 --> 21:38.923
I have something
so hot for you, baby

21:38.925 --> 21:40.126
so hot, I am burning all over.

21:42.094 --> 21:45.062
Well, I'll leave y'all two
to y'all business.

21:45.064 --> 21:46.732
Bye, Peaches.

21:49.936 --> 21:51.938
Well, what you got?

21:53.806 --> 21:55.207
This.

21:57.276 --> 21:59.910
Wowza! Where the fuck
did you get that?

21:59.912 --> 22:01.812
Don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

22:01.814 --> 22:03.280
That's gotta be fucking...

22:03.282 --> 22:04.350
What are you gonna get me
for it?

22:06.218 --> 22:08.686
I mean, college kids will pay,
like, 800 for that shit.

22:08.688 --> 22:10.823
1.5K or I sell it here.

22:12.091 --> 22:13.991
If you try and sell it here

22:13.993 --> 22:15.558
whoever you stole it from
is gonna find out.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.029
Get real grumpy about it.

22:18.798 --> 22:20.132
1K.

22:23.903 --> 22:25.769
All right, we have a deal

22:25.771 --> 22:28.706
but you gotta do
this extra thing for me first

22:28.708 --> 22:30.140
in the school.

22:30.142 --> 22:32.910
- Is it gonna make me money?
- Mm-hmm.

22:32.912 --> 22:34.714
You know what that makes me
for Halloween?

22:37.817 --> 22:39.617
Hot and horny?

23:02.341 --> 23:04.875
Come on, mate.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.180
Don't you dare
fucking answer it.

23:10.182 --> 23:12.251
- What if it's Pink?
- God, fuck Pink.

23:13.886 --> 23:17.721
- The fuck nugget, Jimmy.
- Shut up!

23:17.723 --> 23:21.058
Uh, yeah. What, delivery?

23:21.060 --> 23:23.162
Okay, yeah,
I'll be there in a wink.

23:25.031 --> 23:26.766
Real fucking nice.

23:29.835 --> 23:33.005
What? Do you wanna sell
the rock or not? He's the guy.

23:36.142 --> 23:37.908
Look, we got time for a quickie.

23:37.910 --> 23:40.811
Kiss my grits, Jimmy.

23:40.813 --> 23:42.146
You ever heard
of seize the moment?

23:42.148 --> 23:43.947
It's gone now
and you didn't seize it.

23:43.949 --> 23:46.185
Yeah, well, I'll fucking
seize it next time, all right.

23:50.389 --> 23:51.957
Get out.

23:53.793 --> 23:55.161
Get out.

24:44.877 --> 24:47.012
Dallas?

24:54.253 --> 24:55.888
Get the fuck off of her!

24:58.124 --> 24:59.624
Up.

25:12.705 --> 25:16.073
Well, you saved me
from the big rabbit.

25:16.075 --> 25:17.774
Drink.

25:17.776 --> 25:19.278
Drink.

25:23.215 --> 25:24.884
How did you get those scars?

25:31.323 --> 25:33.159
Did you do that to yourself?

25:46.972 --> 25:49.141
It started
with robbing tourists.

25:52.945 --> 25:56.916
Then, car parts.

25:59.952 --> 26:02.154
Then cash machines.

26:11.263 --> 26:13.299
We were a gang of six.

26:15.234 --> 26:17.236
All different.

26:20.940 --> 26:23.307
Like, in a family.

26:23.309 --> 26:26.143
And what'd you do
with the money?

26:26.145 --> 26:29.446
Paid the smugglers
to bring me here.

26:29.448 --> 26:31.784
It was the only way.

26:35.421 --> 26:38.290
- And trucks.
- Trucks?

26:42.261 --> 26:45.262
I was in charge
of getting the trucks to stop

26:45.264 --> 26:46.398
so that we could rob them.

26:49.835 --> 26:51.770
I...

26:54.506 --> 26:57.810
I hopped in
to this old man's truck.

26:59.144 --> 27:00.379
And...

27:01.213 --> 27:03.282
we drove for a bit.

27:07.553 --> 27:11.357
Then, he suddenly stopped
in the middle of nowhere.

27:12.524 --> 27:14.293
And he jumped on me.

27:21.133 --> 27:22.935
I took care of it.

27:24.503 --> 27:26.105
How?

27:36.915 --> 27:38.450
Lie on me.

27:50.162 --> 27:51.930
Okay.

27:53.432 --> 27:55.134
Closer.

28:03.942 --> 28:05.477
Kiss my neck.

28:20.559 --> 28:22.428
Then he pulled down his pants.

29:22.254 --> 29:25.622
A new vision
will govern our land.

29:25.624 --> 29:27.725
From this day forward

29:27.727 --> 29:29.526
it's going to be

29:29.528 --> 29:32.730
only America first!

29:32.732 --> 29:35.100
America first!

29:37.202 --> 29:39.436
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- What?

29:39.438 --> 29:41.138
Did you find out
about my passport?

29:44.243 --> 29:46.646
Good morning. Tides Plaza Motel.

29:51.718 --> 29:55.218
We must protect our borders
from the ravages...

29:59.726 --> 30:01.326
Shut up.

30:13.740 --> 30:16.339
Empty the safe and hand it over,
you karaoke bitch

30:16.341 --> 30:18.108
or I will stuff this into
every fucking hole in your body

30:18.110 --> 30:19.378
and pull the goddamn trigger.

30:22.414 --> 30:26.082
Get on the bed. On the bed.

30:26.084 --> 30:27.484
Take your clothes off.

30:27.486 --> 30:29.219
You're a fucking hot mess,
you know that?

30:29.221 --> 30:30.589
Shut up!

30:42.702 --> 30:44.735
Please, I don't have anything.
All the money is in...

30:44.737 --> 30:47.638
Shut up!

30:47.640 --> 30:50.173
Stop lying or I'll blow
your fucking ear off.

30:50.175 --> 30:53.210
You ever seen anybody
without an ear?

30:53.212 --> 30:54.244
Looks like they got a black hole
on the side of their head

30:54.246 --> 30:56.181
and it's fucking gross.

30:57.349 --> 30:59.082
Thank God.

30:59.084 --> 31:00.450
How was that?

31:00.452 --> 31:03.455
That was sexy.

31:04.423 --> 31:06.757
The tits were a nice touch.

31:06.759 --> 31:11.595
I'm ready for some R&R, Jimmy.
Ruthless revenge.

31:11.597 --> 31:13.332
That bitch is not gonna know
what hit her.

31:14.566 --> 31:16.401
Are those mine?

31:25.544 --> 31:27.446
- What?
- Stop it.

31:32.785 --> 31:34.687
You're gonna give yourself
a heart attack, you know?

31:51.704 --> 31:53.438
Uh, hello?

31:55.507 --> 31:57.607
It's gonna be so easy, in
and out and we split it 50-50-

31:57.609 --> 31:59.409
She is one moody fuck.

31:59.411 --> 32:02.647
Hey, Dallas, you in or not?

32:02.649 --> 32:06.651
I don't know, Jimmy. It all
seems a bit sketchy for me.

32:06.653 --> 32:09.586
Listen, I'm going out
on a limb here for you

32:09.588 --> 32:10.888
robbing my own flesh and blood.
What are you doing for me?

32:10.890 --> 32:13.559
Jeez. All right.

32:17.129 --> 32:18.463
Hey.

32:23.402 --> 32:25.203
Thank you.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.274
Dallas!

32:30.810 --> 32:32.710
- What?
- What's that?

32:32.712 --> 32:35.278
- It's Doreen.
- Doreen?

32:35.280 --> 32:36.747
Yeah, Doreen.
Jimmy gave her to me.

32:36.749 --> 32:38.450
I hate rats.

32:42.521 --> 32:44.487
You don't really like Jimmy
at all, do you?

32:44.489 --> 32:45.825
I don't know him.

32:47.259 --> 32:48.661
You're just jealous.

32:50.429 --> 32:51.563
Shut up!

32:59.438 --> 33:01.708
I'm just fucking with you.
I have a job for you.

33:10.582 --> 33:12.449
- What's this?
- What we're getting.

33:12.451 --> 33:14.952
- Where?
- School.

33:14.954 --> 33:16.787
- I'm not doing it.
- Okay.

33:16.789 --> 33:18.523
How do you think we're gonna
get out of here then, Riz?

33:20.627 --> 33:23.493
Folding bed sheets?
Wiping people's shit?

33:23.495 --> 33:25.896
Okay, this is America.
You want the...

33:25.898 --> 33:28.633
Hey, you want the rainbow,
you gotta put up with the rain.

33:28.635 --> 33:30.901
You know who said that?

33:30.903 --> 33:33.205
Dolly Parton.

33:38.543 --> 33:39.746
No.

34:39.871 --> 34:42.474
Oh!

34:48.513 --> 34:50.315
There is no smoking
in the lobby.

34:54.553 --> 34:57.487
No hi, hello? Just straight
to barking orders, huh?

34:57.489 --> 35:00.557
Where have you been?
There's work to do here!

35:00.559 --> 35:05.361
Pink and I checked out
the trampoline house. Hey.

35:05.363 --> 35:08.598
I can't do everything myself,
you know?

35:08.600 --> 35:09.900
Is that why you're planning your
escape, buying the fucking...

35:09.902 --> 35:12.002
I'm serious, Jimmy.

35:12.004 --> 35:13.804
You gotta step it up

35:13.806 --> 35:16.539
if you're gonna take over
this place one day.

35:16.541 --> 35:17.977
I got you
that Codeine you needed.

35:20.312 --> 35:22.412
This buy me a break?

35:22.414 --> 35:25.383
For now, yeah. Come on.

35:27.086 --> 35:28.786
There's no oxy today?

35:28.788 --> 35:30.489
You're welcome, ma.

35:33.893 --> 35:35.492
Thank you.

35:35.494 --> 35:37.262
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

35:38.097 --> 35:40.365
- I win!
- That doesn't count.

35:48.741 --> 35:50.810
- Three! Three!
- Okay.

36:05.390 --> 36:07.627
Oh, you...
Keep it, girl.

36:17.837 --> 36:20.572
You two Bonnie and Bonnie
or something, huh?

36:21.506 --> 36:23.707
Well, game's over now.

36:23.709 --> 36:26.444
Where is it, hmm, huh?

36:29.982 --> 36:32.819
Give me my fucking shit! Fuck!

37:34.579 --> 37:36.481
No one's ever saved me before.

37:48.493 --> 37:50.162
It's gonna be okay.

37:52.965 --> 37:55.467
It's not okay.

37:56.636 --> 37:59.138
It's over, Dallas. I'm done.

38:00.039 --> 38:01.841
How?

38:03.175 --> 38:04.677
They're gonna lock me up.

38:06.578 --> 38:08.480
It was self-defense, okay?
He tried to kill me.

38:10.016 --> 38:11.717
Self-defense?

38:27.033 --> 38:28.801
Do you know
what they will do with me?

38:32.705 --> 38:33.804
We're all
just a bunch of sinners

38:33.806 --> 38:35.806
doing the best that we can.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.884
What?

38:50.189 --> 38:52.024
No one saw us.

38:54.627 --> 38:57.161
Okay, look.

38:57.163 --> 38:59.296
It's gonna be fine. Okay.

38:59.298 --> 39:01.033
- Don't...
- Stop it!

39:03.102 --> 39:05.137
He's dead.

39:07.940 --> 39:09.742
We just need to get to work.

39:11.811 --> 39:13.045
Stop.

39:14.046 --> 39:15.212
- What?
- What are you doing?

39:15.214 --> 39:17.047
I'm moving the body.

39:17.049 --> 39:18.550
Leave him.

39:24.290 --> 39:26.558
If we're doing this,
we have to do it right.

39:28.194 --> 39:29.996
Go put the gloves on.

40:25.718 --> 40:28.154
Room 166 is in my list.

40:32.158 --> 40:33.959
You're calling me a whore?

40:49.375 --> 40:51.077
Look, he know...

40:52.411 --> 40:55.714
Look, he knew
that I sold his stash to Jimmy.

41:17.870 --> 41:19.338
Hey...

41:20.439 --> 41:23.843
I need this.
Wake up.

41:24.343 --> 41:25.911
Come.

41:30.749 --> 41:32.184
You should go to your room.

41:36.822 --> 41:38.190
Go.

41:53.139 --> 41:55.641
Morning, ladies.

41:56.842 --> 41:58.277
Looking good.

42:29.175 --> 42:30.843
Get that other one.

42:45.891 --> 42:48.492
You know, my mama was
in a traveling country band?

42:48.494 --> 42:50.829
Not, like, anything fancy.

42:52.264 --> 42:54.064
She lived paycheck to paycheck

42:54.066 --> 42:58.068
and whored it up
with any and every club owner

42:58.070 --> 43:00.437
that she could find.

43:00.439 --> 43:05.475
As luck would have it, she was
eight months pregnant in Dallas

43:05.477 --> 43:08.045
when I decided to come early.

43:08.047 --> 43:09.949
She couldn't really...
Hey, well, grab me that.

43:14.453 --> 43:16.086
She couldn't think of a name.

43:16.088 --> 43:18.889
She thought...

43:18.891 --> 43:21.327
"We're in Dallas,
so why not call her Dallas?"

43:22.394 --> 43:23.429
That's how I got my name.

43:25.364 --> 43:27.266
I like the name Dallas.

43:29.301 --> 43:31.136
How'd you get your name?

43:35.407 --> 43:37.176
From my grandmother.

44:16.515 --> 44:20.017
Wow! You look like shit.

44:20.019 --> 44:22.552
Where the fuck have you been?
I've been calling you all night.

44:22.554 --> 44:25.322
- Went out for a walk.
- That's romantic.

44:25.324 --> 44:26.857
Listen,
we have to do this tonight.

44:26.859 --> 44:27.991
Do what?

44:27.993 --> 44:30.894
None of your business, munchkin.

44:30.896 --> 44:34.331
School. Midnight. Be there.

44:34.333 --> 44:37.401
I don't think
I'm up for it tonight, Jimmy.

44:37.403 --> 44:39.503
Are you kidding me?

44:39.505 --> 44:42.506
- It's gonna be so easy.
- Don't.

44:42.508 --> 44:44.141
I've been planning this shit
for the past three months.

44:44.143 --> 44:45.942
Now you just decide
you're not feeling it?

44:45.944 --> 44:47.446
Pink's expecting it.

44:48.947 --> 44:51.250
I'm not Pink's bitch, you are.

44:53.218 --> 44:54.985
What happened to that crank,
anyways?

44:54.987 --> 44:57.220
I'm selling it. You know what?
Maybe I won't.

44:57.222 --> 44:59.356
If tonight's off,
all deals are off.

44:59.358 --> 45:01.193
Jimmy boy is flying solo.

45:07.032 --> 45:09.066
Jimmy!

45:09.068 --> 45:13.036
Jimmy, wait, please.
I'm sorry, baby. I...

45:13.038 --> 45:15.974
It's just been a rough night,
okay? I'm sorry. I'll be there.

45:18.210 --> 45:21.080
It's all right.
You know how I get sometimes.

45:31.156 --> 45:32.624
Do you think he knows?

45:33.525 --> 45:35.258
He's a decent fuck

45:35.260 --> 45:36.929
but he is not
the brightest of bulbs.

45:44.603 --> 45:46.872
He wants to do
the robbery tonight.

45:47.506 --> 45:49.274
Which robbery?

45:50.142 --> 45:51.910
The one at the school.

45:53.278 --> 45:54.544
- No, please, Riz.
- No.

45:54.546 --> 45:56.279
- Riz, we need your help.
- No. No.

45:56.281 --> 45:58.615
Riz, we need
to get out of here.

45:58.617 --> 46:00.953
Do you know how many pills
we will find in that school?

46:06.392 --> 46:09.461
Look, I promise, I will take you
to Niagara Falls myself after.

46:15.267 --> 46:17.401
Please.

46:17.403 --> 46:21.405
Don't you think
the lights are pretty?

46:21.407 --> 46:23.473
This is my favorite song.

46:23.475 --> 46:26.176
- Yes, I know.
- Did you know that?

46:26.178 --> 46:29.515
- Yes, I know.
- Okay!

46:53.338 --> 46:55.305
It's a good song.

46:55.307 --> 46:56.942
You know that Fleetwood Mac?
They're great.

47:01.681 --> 47:04.347
Oh, fuck.
What the fuck is she doing here?

47:04.349 --> 47:07.386
We need three
to pull this off, okay?

47:09.689 --> 47:12.522
Fine, you can come, just
don't be no stool pigeon, okay?

47:12.524 --> 47:15.392
What the fuck
is this fucking estrogena?

47:15.394 --> 47:18.462
Oh, Una's menopause pills.
Just throw them on the floor.

47:18.464 --> 47:21.634
- Have you got the keys?
- The key to success.

47:26.371 --> 47:28.205
I wanna be with you.

47:28.207 --> 47:29.740
Wait, you look scared!

47:29.742 --> 47:32.042
- Don't be scared!
- Well, why not?

47:32.044 --> 47:33.612
- It's fun! It's the song!
- Si, si, si.

48:06.211 --> 48:07.645
There's a camera
at the entrance.

48:07.647 --> 48:08.713
Yeah, I know.
It's been broke for months.

48:08.715 --> 48:10.347
You sure?

48:10.349 --> 48:12.484
Yeah, I'm sure.
Just don't get in the way.

48:38.544 --> 48:40.078
What?

48:44.784 --> 48:46.316
"I wanna be a pilot
when I grow up."

48:46.318 --> 48:48.253
- What is it?
- Put that shit down.

49:05.470 --> 49:06.605
Jimmy boy?

50:44.904 --> 50:46.471
Damn it.

50:47.807 --> 50:50.306
- What's wrong?
- It should be this one.

50:50.308 --> 50:51.576
Well, did you bring
the right key?

50:52.511 --> 50:54.344
What?

50:54.346 --> 50:55.748
He didn't bring
the right fuckin' key.

50:57.315 --> 50:59.850
- Okay, let me try.
- Give me a sec, okay, Dallas?

50:59.852 --> 51:01.888
All right, fine with me.

51:03.690 --> 51:05.223
- I don't know.
- Mm-hmm.

51:07.827 --> 51:09.261
What the fuck was that?

51:09.862 --> 51:10.930
Let me try.

51:15.567 --> 51:16.901
- Let me try.
- What? No.

51:16.903 --> 51:18.470
Fucking let her try, Jimmy.

51:30.783 --> 51:33.283
Shit!

51:33.285 --> 51:35.387
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah, shut up.

51:37.322 --> 51:38.825
- So glad we brought her-
- Shut up!

51:45.330 --> 51:46.699
Fucking go!

51:47.499 --> 51:48.668
Hurry the fuck up.

51:56.008 --> 51:57.641
- We have to go.
- We have to go!

51:57.643 --> 51:59.344
- We have to go. Let's go!
- Yeah.

52:13.425 --> 52:14.794
Oh, shit.

52:15.728 --> 52:17.262
Go!

52:48.895 --> 52:51.731
This is gonna be
our passport to paradise.

52:53.766 --> 52:56.434
I get the nail salon,
you get the passport.

52:57.502 --> 52:59.904
Ain't that right, Jimmy?

52:59.906 --> 53:01.540
Yeah, Pink makes passports.

53:03.109 --> 53:04.644
He's gonna get you
a pink passport.

53:09.015 --> 53:11.514
Where the fuck
you learn to do that?

53:11.516 --> 53:13.019
These fingers are <i>muy</i> talented.

53:44.183 --> 53:45.383
Dance with me.

56:44.630 --> 56:45.998
Wild night?

56:47.767 --> 56:49.268
We have to talk, Jimmy.

56:50.636 --> 56:52.636
I found it.

56:52.638 --> 56:53.605
Found what?

56:54.774 --> 56:56.874
In the basement.

56:56.876 --> 56:59.009
You went through my...

56:59.011 --> 57:00.811
You went through
my fucking stuff again?

57:00.813 --> 57:02.081
Why do you do this?

57:03.749 --> 57:05.215
- What are you trying to prove?
- What am I...

57:05.217 --> 57:07.751
What are you trying to prove?

57:07.753 --> 57:09.219
I don't wanna run this
fucking-piece-of-shit motel!

57:09.221 --> 57:10.187
I've got my own business
with Pink.

57:10.189 --> 57:13.857
Jimmy, grow up! Jeez!

57:13.859 --> 57:16.827
This isn't some dime bag
of stolen pills.

57:16.829 --> 57:19.129
This could get you
in real trouble.

57:19.131 --> 57:21.200
You want to get your ass
fucked in jail?

57:26.338 --> 57:29.339
You've gotta clean up.

57:29.341 --> 57:32.776
Like a good boy
and come help me out here.

57:32.778 --> 57:35.012
You liked those classes
at the community college.

57:35.014 --> 57:36.315
You could go back.

57:38.117 --> 57:39.416
Who's gonna buy
your fucking Vicodin

57:39.418 --> 57:41.854
if I'm in community college,
hmm?

57:42.655 --> 57:44.655
Fuck you, Una.

57:44.657 --> 57:48.725
It's mom to you.

57:48.727 --> 57:52.231
And I don't work this hard
to watch you waste yourself.

57:53.265 --> 57:54.667
- Just give me that!
- No!

57:58.437 --> 58:00.337
I am keeping this hostage

58:00.339 --> 58:02.108
until you get your act together!

58:09.982 --> 58:11.851
Fuck!

58:12.985 --> 58:14.353
Fuck!

58:17.990 --> 58:19.125
Where are the drugs?

58:27.333 --> 58:30.402
Jimmy just probably took 'em
to sell them or something.

58:36.408 --> 58:38.944
Don't stress. I trust him, okay?
He's one of us.

59:29.495 --> 59:33.130
Let's try it again.
What are your names?

59:33.132 --> 59:36.166
And what are you doing here?

59:36.168 --> 59:37.501
It's $40 for an hour

59:37.503 --> 59:39.870
120 for the night,
paid in advance.

59:39.872 --> 59:41.273
For the night.

59:44.510 --> 59:47.046
Supposed to be meeting a friend
of mine who's staying here.

59:50.015 --> 59:52.151
- Your name?
- Oh.

59:53.953 --> 59:55.788
Floyd. Floyd Lutz.

59:56.922 --> 59:57.990
Who's your friend?

59:59.058 --> 01:00:00.893
His name is Sal.

01:00:08.067 --> 01:00:11.034
Lutz is L-U-T-Z.

01:00:11.036 --> 01:00:12.404
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:13.439 --> 01:00:15.741
Mm-hmm.

01:00:17.977 --> 01:00:19.211
Is he here?

01:00:23.449 --> 01:00:25.384
I don't want any trouble.

01:00:42.134 --> 01:00:43.235
Riz?

01:00:44.403 --> 01:00:46.839
Will you take Mr. Lutz
to Sal's room?

01:00:48.073 --> 01:00:50.307
Riz!

01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:51.810
I don't give a shit.

01:00:59.451 --> 01:01:01.053
Chilly day, ain't it?

01:01:14.366 --> 01:01:17.000
You sure this is his room?

01:01:17.002 --> 01:01:19.204
It is clean as a whistle.

01:01:26.512 --> 01:01:28.414
I guess he must have left.

01:01:43.529 --> 01:01:45.531
Well-

01:01:47.199 --> 01:01:49.535
Now that
is a comfortable mattress, eh?

01:01:52.538 --> 01:01:55.074
If I had a mattress this
comfortable, I'd sleep all day.

01:01:56.241 --> 01:01:58.310
So.

01:01:59.945 --> 01:02:01.313
Where is he?

01:02:24.536 --> 01:02:26.238
I'll get you another bulb.

01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:30.340
Hey, do you wanna feed Doreen?

01:02:30.342 --> 01:02:31.709
Why are you always feeding her?

01:02:31.711 --> 01:02:33.143
She's going to die from choking

01:02:33.145 --> 01:02:34.211
or get fat
and have a heart attack.

01:02:34.213 --> 01:02:36.446
What got into you today?

01:02:36.448 --> 01:02:38.083
Someone came in looking for Sal.

01:02:38.685 --> 01:02:40.250
What?

01:02:40.252 --> 01:02:41.320
Creepy as hell.

01:02:46.392 --> 01:02:48.458
Okay, maybe he's just, you know

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:51.161
just here for the night,
and he's gonna leave tomorrow.

01:02:51.163 --> 01:02:52.931
It doesn't feel right.

01:02:54.266 --> 01:02:56.101
We just need to stay calm.

01:02:57.436 --> 01:02:59.336
Just stay calm.

01:02:59.338 --> 01:03:00.572
We?

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:05.041
It's all your fault, Dallas.

01:03:05.043 --> 01:03:07.279
Okay, how is this my fault?
You're the one who killed him.

01:03:09.749 --> 01:03:11.617
I saved your ass!

01:03:12.985 --> 01:03:15.552
- You were the one in his room.
- Shh.

01:03:15.554 --> 01:03:18.023
You stole from me,
that's why I stole from him.

01:03:23.262 --> 01:03:25.063
I need to get him a bulb.

01:03:51.023 --> 01:03:54.024
Jesus, fuck!
Who the fuck are you?

01:03:54.026 --> 01:03:55.325
Blood red.

01:03:55.327 --> 01:03:56.627
How the hell did...

01:03:56.629 --> 01:03:58.261
Get the fuck out!

01:03:58.263 --> 01:04:00.163
You like the color?

01:04:00.165 --> 01:04:02.432
Yeah, of course, I fucking do.
It's my fucking nail polish.

01:04:02.434 --> 01:04:04.134
Get the fuck out of here
before I call somebody.

01:04:04.136 --> 01:04:05.437
Easy.

01:04:07.105 --> 01:04:09.339
- Get out!
- Okay. Shh, it's okay.

01:04:09.341 --> 01:04:11.174
- Get out!
- Look at that.

01:04:11.176 --> 01:04:12.611
- Look at this color.
- Get out!

01:04:13.512 --> 01:04:15.312
Don't fuck with me.

01:04:15.314 --> 01:04:16.582
Now.

01:04:19.051 --> 01:04:21.618
Do you even know

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.355
what's in nail polish?

01:04:25.491 --> 01:04:29.627
Dibutyl phthalate, toluene

01:04:29.629 --> 01:04:31.230
and formaldehyde.

01:04:32.832 --> 01:04:38.101
Now, you look like
you know something about drugs.

01:04:38.103 --> 01:04:42.205
Why don't you tell me
everything you know

01:04:42.207 --> 01:04:44.675
and I won't make you drink

01:04:44.677 --> 01:04:45.645
that nail polish?

01:04:59.659 --> 01:05:01.093
What are you doing?

01:05:06.131 --> 01:05:07.332
Jimmy and I were really in love.

01:05:11.771 --> 01:05:13.338
We were gonna run away.

01:05:16.676 --> 01:05:18.711
Just the two of us.

01:05:22.581 --> 01:05:24.082
Then Una found out and...

01:05:30.757 --> 01:05:33.058
We were gonna call her Austin.

01:05:38.497 --> 01:05:40.132
Austin?

01:05:43.335 --> 01:05:45.870
You know, not even, I wasn't
even fucking born in Texas.

01:05:45.872 --> 01:05:48.708
I was born in Michigan.

01:05:51.143 --> 01:05:52.779
What sort of a name is Detroit?

01:05:54.212 --> 01:05:55.480
Right?

01:05:58.417 --> 01:06:00.250
- Let's just...
- Don't tell me...

01:06:00.252 --> 01:06:01.786
- What's your problem? What?
- You can't tell me to go.

01:06:01.788 --> 01:06:04.220
Don't! What's my problem?

01:06:04.222 --> 01:06:06.256
What is my problem, hey?

01:06:06.258 --> 01:06:08.826
My problem is being stuck here
with people like you!

01:06:08.828 --> 01:06:10.393
- Stop!
- You fucking scavenger!

01:06:10.395 --> 01:06:12.397
He had a fucking gun in my face!

01:06:14.499 --> 01:06:16.401
A fucking gun!

01:06:31.617 --> 01:06:33.751
Let's play spin the bottle.

01:06:33.753 --> 01:06:36.252
If it lands on the left,
then I jump

01:06:36.254 --> 01:06:37.955
and if it lands on the right,
you fucking jump.

01:06:37.957 --> 01:06:39.690
- I don't want to play.
- Oh, you don't want to play?

01:06:39.692 --> 01:06:41.193
You don't want to play?

01:06:42.527 --> 01:06:44.563
- That's fine. I'll fucking jump.
- No.

01:06:46.699 --> 01:06:48.868
What is wrong with you, Dallas?

01:06:53.472 --> 01:06:55.140
Floyd knows.

01:06:56.676 --> 01:06:58.410
We're dead.

01:14:29.361 --> 01:14:31.163
I buried him next to his friend.

01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:53.779
Just put it up to my ear.

01:15:55.381 --> 01:15:57.247
What?

01:15:57.249 --> 01:15:59.449
Jimmy, where the fuck
have you been?

01:15:59.451 --> 01:16:01.018
I've called you,
like, a billion times.

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.454
Whoa, calm down. Jesus.
What do you want?

01:16:04.456 --> 01:16:07.257
Listen, if you don't wanna
rob Una, it's fine

01:16:07.259 --> 01:16:08.992
but I need the money.

01:16:08.994 --> 01:16:10.229
What money?

01:16:11.497 --> 01:16:16.033
From the school
and the school drugs and...

01:16:16.035 --> 01:16:18.168
All right, listen, let's just
meet behind the dumpster.

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:20.103
What?

01:16:20.105 --> 01:16:21.405
The fucking dumpster
behind the motel.

01:16:21.407 --> 01:16:22.942
Get rid of her.

01:16:41.493 --> 01:16:43.028
Jimmy?

01:17:02.248 --> 01:17:03.515
Fuck you!

01:17:40.119 --> 01:17:42.087
He lied, Riz.

01:17:46.525 --> 01:17:48.260
He took our money.

01:17:52.031 --> 01:17:54.166
After all these years,
he fucked me.

01:17:58.304 --> 01:18:00.172
Did you hear what I just said?

01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:14.551
Listen. Dallas.

01:18:14.553 --> 01:18:16.588
Dallas.

01:18:19.525 --> 01:18:21.360
Jimmy is a sister-fucker.

01:18:22.261 --> 01:18:23.996
We don't need him.

01:18:25.564 --> 01:18:27.964
We can get a car.

01:18:27.966 --> 01:18:30.067
We can leave this place.

01:18:30.069 --> 01:18:31.537
Then what?

01:18:33.572 --> 01:18:35.939
We go somewhere else.

01:18:35.941 --> 01:18:38.310
- Find a job.
- Find a job?

01:18:40.412 --> 01:18:43.148
Where would we go, okay?
We're fucking criminals.

01:18:44.216 --> 01:18:46.383
Fine.

01:18:46.385 --> 01:18:47.953
So we leave this country.

01:18:50.122 --> 01:18:52.522
We don't have any money.

01:18:52.524 --> 01:18:54.226
You don't even have
a fucking passport.

01:19:03.001 --> 01:19:05.235
We get it from Una's safe.

01:19:05.237 --> 01:19:07.039
The money, the passport.

01:19:08.641 --> 01:19:11.208
We start over.

01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:12.478
Good.

01:19:18.283 --> 01:19:19.985
No, we get it from Jimmy...

01:19:24.089 --> 01:19:25.891
what he fucking owes us.

01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:33.198
Fine.

01:19:39.271 --> 01:19:40.437
Could you pass me
the nail polishes, please?

01:19:40.439 --> 01:19:41.540
Yeah, reds and pinks.

01:19:42.241 --> 01:19:43.475
That's fine.

01:19:53.318 --> 01:19:56.219
- Let's go.
- What about Doreen?

01:19:56.221 --> 01:19:58.288
- You're taking her, right?
- What the f...

01:19:58.290 --> 01:20:01.057
No, it's just a fucking mouse.

01:20:01.059 --> 01:20:03.393
You'd leave her alone
by herself?

01:20:03.395 --> 01:20:05.128
Riz, we have to go.

01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:06.565
Dallas.

01:20:08.434 --> 01:20:10.169
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:20:14.473 --> 01:20:15.642
No, wait.

01:20:28.454 --> 01:20:30.189
Now we're ready.

01:20:57.349 --> 01:20:58.584
What are you...

01:21:01.353 --> 01:21:03.688
Shit! You are
so fucking gangster, Riz.

01:21:05.157 --> 01:21:06.657
- Yeah.
- Switch with me.

01:21:06.659 --> 01:21:08.126
Okay.

01:21:10.295 --> 01:21:11.530
Fine.

01:21:16.602 --> 01:21:18.435
- Oh, shit.
- You've got the gun, right?

01:21:18.437 --> 01:21:21.471
- What? No, I...
- I gave it to you!

01:21:21.473 --> 01:21:23.406
- You have the gun!
- I fucking...

01:21:23.408 --> 01:21:24.474
Oh, God.
We're fine, we have the gun.

01:21:24.476 --> 01:21:25.712
Take it.

01:22:10.857 --> 01:22:13.189
Oh, Jesus. Fuck!

01:22:13.191 --> 01:22:15.893
- Fuck!
- What the fuck is this?

01:22:15.895 --> 01:22:18.428
- Peaches, what the fuck?
- What?

01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:20.430
You fucking serious right now?

01:22:20.432 --> 01:22:22.267
Hmm? Peaches?

01:22:23.535 --> 01:22:26.336
- Riz.
- Oh, my God!

01:22:26.338 --> 01:22:28.505
- Sister-fucker.
- Yeah, what a shame.

01:22:28.507 --> 01:22:31.474
What the fuck?
Who the fuck is this?

01:22:31.476 --> 01:22:34.144
- What are you...
- You're a scumbag.

01:22:34.146 --> 01:22:36.714
- We want the money.
- You lied to us, okay?

01:22:36.716 --> 01:22:39.451
You lied to me, you lied to Riz,
and you stole.

01:22:40.887 --> 01:22:42.653
- Give them the fucking money.
- What money?

01:22:42.655 --> 01:22:44.789
Get out of the bed.

01:22:44.791 --> 01:22:46.924
- Get out.
- Get out of the bed!

01:22:46.926 --> 01:22:48.693
Fucking,
put some fucking clothes on!

01:22:48.695 --> 01:22:50.162
I don't wanna see your dick.

01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:53.229
Quick. Quick!

01:22:53.231 --> 01:22:54.533
All right, look.

01:22:56.168 --> 01:22:57.336
There's no money.

01:22:58.170 --> 01:22:59.672
The drugs are gone, too.

01:23:03.575 --> 01:23:05.143
Asshole.

01:23:06.746 --> 01:23:08.713
Oh, fuck! Okay. All right.

01:23:08.715 --> 01:23:10.817
Okay! Fuck.

01:23:13.552 --> 01:23:15.387
Jesus,
put that fucking thing away!

01:23:22.527 --> 01:23:23.663
How much is there?

01:23:25.965 --> 01:23:27.832
- This is from the pills.
- That's all I have.

01:23:27.834 --> 01:23:30.268
- What about the coke, hmm?
- Where's the coke?

01:23:31.303 --> 01:23:32.369
- Pink-
- Where's the coke?

01:23:32.371 --> 01:23:33.904
- Pink has it!
- Okay.

01:23:33.906 --> 01:23:35.773
Well, why don't you call Pink?

01:23:35.775 --> 01:23:37.542
Because we need
the fucking money.

01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:39.944
Call him.

01:23:39.946 --> 01:23:41.380
Call him!

01:23:46.485 --> 01:23:47.754
Hmm?

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.259
Shit.

01:23:56.261 --> 01:23:57.797
Okay, what the fuck do you mean,
"Shit?"

01:23:59.331 --> 01:24:00.965
- What do you mean, "Shit?"
- It's gone.

01:24:00.967 --> 01:24:02.633
Don't touch me.

01:24:02.635 --> 01:24:04.702
It's gone, hmm?

01:24:04.704 --> 01:24:08.505
It's gone. I don't have it.

01:24:08.507 --> 01:24:10.641
How is it gone? You said
that you gave Pink the coke.

01:24:10.643 --> 01:24:12.977
- No, it's gone.
- Okay.

01:24:12.979 --> 01:24:14.477
You know what, I'm gonna ask you
one more fucking time.

01:24:14.479 --> 01:24:16.281
Where is the fucking coke?

01:24:17.582 --> 01:24:20.283
All right, okay,
there was this crazy bulldog

01:24:20.285 --> 01:24:23.255
and I was on the bus,
on my way to the gym and he...

01:24:23.923 --> 01:24:26.389
Ow! Fuck! Jesus, fuck!

01:24:26.391 --> 01:24:28.391
Oh!

01:24:28.393 --> 01:24:30.928
- Fuck!
- Fuck! Jesus, fuck!

01:24:30.930 --> 01:24:33.463
Oh, Jesus, fuck!

01:24:33.465 --> 01:24:35.935
Oh, God! Oh!

01:24:37.670 --> 01:24:39.269
- Ah!
- You fucking lied.

01:24:39.271 --> 01:24:40.671
You know, all this fucking time

01:24:40.673 --> 01:24:41.706
I thought that we were on
the same team.

01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:43.040
No!

01:24:43.042 --> 01:24:45.408
I thought we were
on the same fucking team!

01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:48.213
Una's my fucking mom, Dallas!

01:24:49.048 --> 01:24:51.450
Dallas, we have to go.

01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:54.517
Dallas.

01:24:54.519 --> 01:24:56.354
You're a fucking coward.

01:25:14.774 --> 01:25:16.241
Una.

01:25:41.566 --> 01:25:44.467
Ooh. That smells nice.

01:25:44.469 --> 01:25:47.470
What, is that, like,
chicken noodles or something?

01:25:47.472 --> 01:25:49.506
- Hmm?
- Spicy chicken.

01:25:49.508 --> 01:25:51.709
Hmm.

01:25:51.711 --> 01:25:53.345
Why are you two
dressed up like that?

01:25:54.446 --> 01:25:55.681
Stop eating.

01:25:57.349 --> 01:25:58.414
Why?

01:25:58.416 --> 01:25:59.950
Oh!

01:25:59.952 --> 01:26:02.485
What the hell?

01:26:02.487 --> 01:26:03.954
- Get over there.
- Oh, my God.

01:26:03.956 --> 01:26:05.022
- Grab a chair.
- What have you got?

01:26:05.024 --> 01:26:06.422
- Is that real?
- Move.

01:26:06.424 --> 01:26:09.727
What are you doing?

01:26:09.729 --> 01:26:11.361
- What are you doing?
- Sit down!

01:26:11.363 --> 01:26:12.462
What are you gonna do,
hold me up?

01:26:12.464 --> 01:26:14.064
Sit!

01:26:14.066 --> 01:26:16.533
What, are you gonna tie me up?
You're gonna kill me?

01:26:16.535 --> 01:26:18.037
Are you gonna kill me?
Is that your...

01:26:19.972 --> 01:26:21.639
- What's the plan, girls?
- Yeah.

01:26:21.641 --> 01:26:24.440
- You got a plan?
- Hmm?

01:26:24.442 --> 01:26:27.814
So what will it be, hmm?
Fleetwood Mac or Sinatra?

01:26:29.514 --> 01:26:30.781
Fuck you.

01:26:30.783 --> 01:26:32.617
Hey,
answer the fucking question!

01:26:33.618 --> 01:26:35.955
Fleetwood Mac. Hah!

01:26:41.093 --> 01:26:43.027
You know, I actually think

01:26:43.029 --> 01:26:44.829
this song might be
more appropriate.

01:26:48.801 --> 01:26:51.168
What's the code?
What's the code to the safe?

01:26:51.170 --> 01:26:52.738
Are you kidding me?

01:26:54.406 --> 01:26:56.807
I'm not telling you
the fucking code.

01:26:56.809 --> 01:26:59.542
- No?
- No!

01:26:59.544 --> 01:27:00.680
No?

01:27:01.781 --> 01:27:03.115
No?

01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:07.483
- Hmm?
- You think I care about that?

01:27:07.485 --> 01:27:09.153
I got all that stuff
in a garage sale.

01:27:09.155 --> 01:27:12.555
Oh, a garage sale?
A garage fucking sale?

01:27:12.557 --> 01:27:14.158
Shit!

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.360
Fuck!

01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:20.099
What about now, hmm?

01:27:21.499 --> 01:27:23.801
What's the code?

01:27:23.803 --> 01:27:25.838
You are wasting your time.

01:27:29.608 --> 01:27:32.410
Give me the fucking gun.
Give me the gun.

01:27:33.913 --> 01:27:36.013
Give us the fucking code

01:27:36.015 --> 01:27:38.583
or I swear to God, I will blow
your fucking head off.

01:27:40.186 --> 01:27:42.487
I'm not giving you anything.
I don't owe you anything.

01:28:03.042 --> 01:28:04.775
Now give me the code
or I'll stuff this

01:28:04.777 --> 01:28:06.646
in every hole in your body
and pull the trigger.

01:28:13.753 --> 01:28:16.956
Twenty seven, eighty five,
sixty three.

01:28:17.723 --> 01:28:19.058
Louder.

01:28:20.259 --> 01:28:21.992
Twenty seven, eighty five,
sixty three.

01:28:21.994 --> 01:28:23.627
Louder.

01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:27.867
Twenty seven, eighty five,
sixty three.

01:28:36.776 --> 01:28:38.210
Now sing.

01:28:43.749 --> 01:28:45.851
Sing!

01:28:47.153 --> 01:28:49.889
Hmm? Sing.

01:28:51.757 --> 01:28:52.923
Sing!

01:28:56.295 --> 01:28:58.929
Thank you, Una, you have done
your good deed for the day.

01:29:00.032 --> 01:29:01.533
Where's my passport?

01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:06.205
- Where's my passport?
- What?

01:29:12.044 --> 01:29:13.511
Where's my passport?

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:19.085
I shredded it.

01:29:37.336 --> 01:29:39.837
Una.

01:29:39.839 --> 01:29:42.239
What did you think
you were gonna do with this?

01:29:42.241 --> 01:29:43.707
It's Jimmy's.

01:29:43.709 --> 01:29:45.077
Excuse me?

01:29:54.987 --> 01:29:57.788
You asked for it.

01:29:57.790 --> 01:29:59.091
Dallas.

01:30:02.228 --> 01:30:04.864
I never asked for any of this.

01:30:08.367 --> 01:30:09.769
Dallas.

01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:14.807
- You're lucky she's the sane one.
- Dallas, let's go.

01:30:20.612 --> 01:30:22.580
Let's get you
an American passport.

01:30:43.369 --> 01:30:45.271
Fuck!

01:30:48.641 --> 01:30:50.374
You gotta go to the hospital,
Jimmy.

01:30:50.376 --> 01:30:52.678
You know who they were?

01:31:00.419 --> 01:31:02.152
Oh, it's just, um-

01:31:02.154 --> 01:31:04.156
Oh, fuck!

01:31:16.235 --> 01:31:19.002
You give them a finger

01:31:19.004 --> 01:31:21.073
they take the whole hand.

01:31:58.944 --> 01:32:01.211
You see that?

01:32:03.449 --> 01:32:05.985
Niagara Falls!

01:32:56.835 --> 01:32:58.368
Dallas!

01:34:37.936 --> 01:34:40.604
We're gonna make it.
