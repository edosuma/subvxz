WEBVTT

00:04.632 --> 00:05.899
Amazing.

00:05.933 --> 00:07.434
Beverly told me
you were lying.

00:07.468 --> 00:09.469
You're just trying
to lure me out to the woods.

00:09.504 --> 00:11.105
Well, if you don't want to ace

00:11.139 --> 00:12.272
the environmental
science class...

00:12.306 --> 00:14.541
I didn't say
I believed her.

00:15.676 --> 00:18.044
The dam is down
here and upstream.

00:18.079 --> 00:19.646
Beavers are second only
to us in their ability

00:19.680 --> 00:22.015
to alter the environment.
That's right.

00:22.049 --> 00:24.918
Now, over here, this used
to be a full-on stream.

00:24.952 --> 00:27.020
Amazing.

00:31.192 --> 00:33.393
Look at the beaver!
Look at the beaver!

00:33.428 --> 00:36.029
This is awesome!

00:36.063 --> 00:38.698
Come on, let me get a picture
of you in front of the dam.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.543 --> 00:49.876
What? What?

00:53.448 --> 00:54.848
Get away from me.

00:54.882 --> 00:56.683
Get away from me!

00:56.717 --> 00:58.084
Help! He's trying to kill me!

00:58.119 --> 00:59.686
Help!
Wait a minute!

00:59.720 --> 01:01.087
He's trying to kill me.
Wait!

01:06.794 --> 01:09.262
<i>You know, you shouldn't</i>
<i>read off that thing.</i>

01:09.297 --> 01:10.430
News should come
from the newspaper.

01:10.465 --> 01:11.765
Do you also feel
we should go

01:11.799 --> 01:12.966
to work on a horse?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.267
You know what?

01:14.302 --> 01:15.502
Technology is not all
about improvement.

01:15.536 --> 01:16.536
Me personally?
I like the feel

01:16.571 --> 01:18.238
of the newspaper
in my hands.

01:18.272 --> 01:20.974
I have access to over 100
newspapers and wire services,

01:21.008 --> 01:23.009
not to mention millions
of Web sites and blogs.

01:23.044 --> 01:24.077
Right, blogs.

01:24.111 --> 01:26.146
I mean, some guy
in his underwear

01:26.180 --> 01:27.781
living in his mom's basement

01:27.815 --> 01:29.516
giving his take
on the economy.

01:29.550 --> 01:30.650
What?!

01:30.685 --> 01:32.719
Tess Brown just called
my last novel

01:32.753 --> 01:34.788
a "turgid slog."

01:34.822 --> 01:35.922
Who's Tess Brown?

01:35.957 --> 01:37.257
The mystery novelist.

01:37.291 --> 01:38.825
She has three
best-sellers to my six.

01:38.860 --> 01:40.861
Well, did you ever say
anything about her stuff?

01:40.895 --> 01:43.163
I did an interview where I
was asked about her last book.

01:43.197 --> 01:44.364
Mm-hmm.

01:44.398 --> 01:45.532
Here.

01:47.835 --> 01:49.603
Well, no wonder she
took a jab at you.

01:49.637 --> 01:50.937
What?
What do you mean "What?"

01:50.972 --> 01:52.772
Look, "Tess Brown
never lets reality

01:52.807 --> 01:54.408
get in the way of an
unbelievable story."

01:54.442 --> 01:55.475
That's accurate.

01:55.510 --> 01:57.410
While her books show
imagination,

01:57.445 --> 01:59.613
they lack the
authority and realism

01:59.647 --> 02:02.516
that academic and
scientific credentials

02:02.550 --> 02:03.950
bring to this specific genre.

02:03.985 --> 02:05.986
You slammed her.
That's a slam.

02:06.020 --> 02:08.255
I don't agree.
Right, of course you don't.

02:08.288 --> 02:10.323
You know, 'cause tact
is not your strong suit.

02:10.358 --> 02:11.825
I'm supposed to take advice
from a Luddite

02:11.859 --> 02:14.361
who thinks the last great
technological achievement

02:14.395 --> 02:16.329
was given to us
by Johannes Gutenberg?

02:16.364 --> 02:18.198
You know what? I rest my case.

02:18.232 --> 02:20.200
Booth.

02:20.234 --> 02:21.868
Right. Okay.

02:21.903 --> 02:23.503
On our way. Okay, well,

02:23.538 --> 02:26.006
got a body behind a rest stop
up by the Blue Ridge Highway.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.141
I may have lost
my temper just now,

02:28.175 --> 02:31.278
but I do consider myself
to be a very tactful person.

02:31.312 --> 02:33.079
Mm-hmm.

02:33.114 --> 02:34.814
That's an attractive tie.

02:34.849 --> 02:36.529
You don't even notice
the milk stain on it.

02:36.551 --> 02:37.617
Very tactful.

02:37.652 --> 02:39.019
Very tactful, Bones.

02:39.053 --> 02:40.353
I thought so.

02:48.629 --> 02:49.629
So, what do we got?

02:49.664 --> 02:51.197
Remains stuck in the beaver dam.

02:51.232 --> 02:53.033
And they're pretty
badly broken up.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.467
Brilliant engineering.

02:54.502 --> 02:55.569
Wow, this guy must've cut

02:55.603 --> 02:56.836
the beaver's work in half.

02:56.871 --> 02:58.171
Yeah, we can't take him out

02:58.205 --> 03:00.307
until we build
another dam upstream,

03:00.341 --> 03:02.976
so this area doesn't flood
and destroy all the evidence.

03:03.010 --> 03:04.611
Based on
the supraorbital margin,

03:04.645 --> 03:06.546
narrow nasal aperture,

03:06.581 --> 03:07.981
and minimal dental wear,

03:08.015 --> 03:10.116
I'd say the victim is
a Caucasoid male

03:10.151 --> 03:12.385
between the ages of 28 and 32.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.888
Insect activity indicates he's
been here about three days.

03:14.922 --> 03:16.022
Agent Booth.
Yeah?

03:16.057 --> 03:17.190
We found a blood trail

03:17.224 --> 03:18.592
at the top of the hill
by the maintenance shed.

03:18.626 --> 03:19.960
It leads down the slope
to the river bed.

03:19.994 --> 03:20.961
Oh, he must've been
killed up there,

03:20.995 --> 03:23.196
and tossed down here.

03:23.230 --> 03:25.031
Right, what's with the gloop?

03:25.066 --> 03:27.968
Yeah, it's from the leopard
slugs all over him.

03:28.002 --> 03:30.503
Their slime is a
polymeric material

03:30.538 --> 03:32.439
that can absorb water and ex...
Stick with the gloop.

03:32.473 --> 03:33.773
Yeah.
The slugs fed

03:33.808 --> 03:34.741
on the victim

03:34.775 --> 03:36.109
after he was killed?
Yup.

03:36.143 --> 03:37.978
I need him removed
before any other evidence

03:38.012 --> 03:39.746
is compromised.
Oh, really?

03:39.780 --> 03:41.014
I hate that we're gonna have

03:41.048 --> 03:42.682
to destroy
the beaver's fine work.

03:42.717 --> 03:43.817
Well, it'll make a good story

03:43.851 --> 03:45.285
for his little
beaver friends, okay?

03:45.319 --> 03:48.221
I want him back
in the lab this afternoon.

03:50.524 --> 03:52.826
I saw the whole article--
Tess Brown also said

03:52.860 --> 03:55.328
that Dr. Brennan's books were
a cure for insomnia.

03:55.363 --> 03:58.331
I really don't think this is
appropriate work conversation.

03:58.366 --> 04:00.500
I'm just saying I'd be mad,
too-- wouldn't you?

04:00.534 --> 04:02.636
I'm sure Dr. Brennan's
developed a thick skin.

04:02.670 --> 04:04.270
You can't survive in
publishing without one.

04:04.305 --> 04:06.139
Without one what?
Without...

04:06.173 --> 04:09.109
a... book.

04:09.143 --> 04:10.610
Of course not.

04:10.645 --> 04:12.145
Look at that.

04:12.179 --> 04:15.882
Yes, the victim is missing
a maxillary lateral incisor.

04:15.916 --> 04:18.485
It's an unusual genetic marker.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.021
Have either of you read
Tess Brown's books?

04:21.055 --> 04:23.023
No. I've heard
she's terrible.

04:23.057 --> 04:24.791
A bitch.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.560
That's maybe a little harsh.

04:27.595 --> 04:29.829
But why read her
when I can read you?

04:29.864 --> 04:31.398
Very true.

04:31.432 --> 04:33.633
I need clean bones as soon
as possible, Mr. Bray.

04:33.668 --> 04:36.102
We have to separate peri-
and postmortem fractures.

04:36.137 --> 04:38.071
Uh, Dr. Hodgins asked
that I wait for him.

04:38.105 --> 04:39.706
You are not on loan
to anyone, Mr. Bray.

04:39.740 --> 04:40.974
You belong to me.

04:41.008 --> 04:43.810
Now clean.

04:43.844 --> 04:45.178
Was that tactless?

04:45.212 --> 04:47.647
I really wasn't
paying attention.

04:47.682 --> 04:49.816
I think I was just direct.

04:51.052 --> 04:52.185
Uh...

04:52.219 --> 04:53.620
I'm stuck.

04:53.654 --> 04:57.023
Uh, I'm stuck, I'm stuck here.

04:57.058 --> 04:58.992
Wendell, I told you to wait.

04:59.026 --> 05:01.127
Excretions from the leopard
slug are a natural glue.

05:01.162 --> 05:03.430
Tell me about it,
but Dr. Brennan gave me an or...

05:03.464 --> 05:04.664
All right, I brought vinegar
and borax in order...

05:04.699 --> 05:06.566
Just-just hold still, okay?

05:08.869 --> 05:10.270
This isn't good.
No, this could burn my skin.

05:10.304 --> 05:11.671
We'll be fine.
Okay.

05:11.706 --> 05:12.672
We just need to get
to the vinegar.

05:12.707 --> 05:14.007
Okay, yeah, yeah.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.542
Ooh, hey, I-I think I see

05:15.576 --> 05:17.143
a perimortem fracture.
Ooh!

05:17.178 --> 05:18.378
Really? Now?

05:18.412 --> 05:20.080
If I get a little closer...

05:20.114 --> 05:21.247
No, Wendell.

05:52.884 --> 05:55.185
I assumed the bones
would be clean, Mr. Bray.

05:55.219 --> 05:56.987
It was a bit more complicated
than I thought.

05:57.021 --> 05:59.456
But I already found something
I thought you should see.

05:59.490 --> 06:01.324
A hairline spiral fracture

06:01.359 --> 06:03.326
to the right humerus.
That type of injury is

06:03.361 --> 06:04.694
often caused by stress

06:04.729 --> 06:06.830
from rotating the
articular capsule.

06:06.864 --> 06:09.366
Like when someone has their arm
twisted behind their back.

06:09.706 --> 06:11.574
It seems as if the killer

06:11.608 --> 06:13.342
took the victim
to that location by force.

06:13.377 --> 06:14.610
I don't think so.

06:14.644 --> 06:18.147
Take another look
at this fracture.

06:18.181 --> 06:20.449
Remodeling. Very slight.

06:20.484 --> 06:22.852
This injury was inflicted
approximately three months ago.

06:22.886 --> 06:25.521
So people have been beating
on this guy for a while.

06:25.555 --> 06:27.123
Hey.

06:27.157 --> 06:29.692
I've got a possible I.D.

06:29.726 --> 06:31.894
Turns out the missing incisor

06:31.928 --> 06:32.895
was the giveaway.

06:32.929 --> 06:34.830
Sean Nolan.

06:36.032 --> 06:37.633
So apparently they
I.D.'d the victim

06:37.667 --> 06:38.968
because he was missing
a little tooth.

06:39.002 --> 06:40.703
Sean Nolan, 30.
Single.

06:40.737 --> 06:43.472
Right. He worked
part-time as a print model.

06:43.507 --> 06:45.608
I'm gonna contact his agent
to see what his last job was.

06:45.642 --> 06:46.742
So why'd you call me?

06:46.777 --> 06:47.710
Well, his live-in girlfriend is

06:47.744 --> 06:49.078
in the conference room.

06:49.112 --> 06:50.846
And she's all broken up
and, you know,

06:50.881 --> 06:52.448
you're better with
the tears than I am.

06:52.482 --> 06:54.450
Wait...

06:54.484 --> 06:56.852
Right.

06:59.389 --> 07:01.524
Hey.
Hey.

07:01.558 --> 07:03.359
Heard about your little mishap
on the platform.

07:03.393 --> 07:04.660
I told him to wait.

07:04.694 --> 07:05.961
You know?

07:05.996 --> 07:08.464
No one appreciates
the power of the mollusk.

07:08.498 --> 07:12.368
Now, when I figure out
what these guys ate,

07:12.402 --> 07:15.337
they're going to be able
to help us catch a killer.

07:15.372 --> 07:16.572
Hey, honey?

07:16.606 --> 07:17.606
What is this?

07:17.641 --> 07:19.074
It looks infected.

07:19.109 --> 07:20.743
Oh yeah, th-that's...

07:20.777 --> 07:21.877
it's-it's nothing.

07:21.912 --> 07:23.646
Remember last month when I had

07:23.680 --> 07:25.481
that little reaction
to the mosquito bite?

07:25.515 --> 07:26.916
Yeah, you-you went
to the doctor.

07:26.950 --> 07:28.651
He said everything was fine.

07:28.685 --> 07:30.953
Actually, I didn't go
'cause I knew what it was.

07:30.987 --> 07:33.122
What? What is it?

07:33.156 --> 07:35.658
Well, I had gotten
some insect samples

07:35.692 --> 07:37.726
from South America and...
and-and anyway,

07:37.761 --> 07:39.628
long story short, uh,

07:39.663 --> 07:42.498
a mosquito deposited an egg

07:42.532 --> 07:43.732
into the dermis of my neck.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.401
<i>Dermatobia Hominis.</i>

07:45.435 --> 07:46.969
It's a human bot fly.

07:47.003 --> 07:50.272
So the hot shower
just made it swell up.

07:50.307 --> 07:52.975
You've been letting
a fly grow

07:53.009 --> 07:55.578
in your neck
for the last month?

07:55.612 --> 07:57.146
Yeah.

07:57.180 --> 07:58.614
Angie, this is a once

07:58.648 --> 08:01.083
in a lifetime opportunity
for me, you know?

08:01.117 --> 08:05.154
I mean, serving as host for one
of Mother Nature's miracles.

08:05.188 --> 08:07.189
Okay, we are going
to Cam right now,

08:07.224 --> 08:10.092
and she is cutting that thing
out of your neck.

08:10.126 --> 08:12.428
How many men can claim
they have given birth?

08:12.462 --> 08:14.063
You're not
actually comparing this

08:14.097 --> 08:15.865
to carrying a child, are you?

08:15.899 --> 08:17.132
Well, no.

08:17.167 --> 08:19.602
No, of course not, but...

08:21.571 --> 08:22.872
You got to admit

08:22.906 --> 08:24.907
he's pretty cute, right?

08:24.941 --> 08:26.575
And looking at my neck,

08:26.610 --> 08:28.677
I think he actually
might come out soon.

08:28.712 --> 08:29.945
You're insane.

08:29.980 --> 08:32.515
We should just focus
on the case.

08:32.549 --> 08:34.183
Okay?

08:34.217 --> 08:35.618
Oh, man.

08:35.652 --> 08:36.852
I've never seen
activity like this.

08:36.886 --> 08:38.654
These guys are
really going at it.

08:38.688 --> 08:39.822
"It"?

08:39.856 --> 08:42.558
Yeah, "it."

08:46.496 --> 08:48.097
<i>People didn't understand</i>

08:48.131 --> 08:49.331
why someone who looked like Sean

08:49.366 --> 08:50.900
would be with someone
like me, but...

08:50.934 --> 08:52.768
we loved each other, and...

08:52.802 --> 08:56.539
he always made me
feel beautiful.

08:56.573 --> 08:58.974
I'm very sorry for your loss.

08:59.009 --> 09:01.544
So, Sean, uh, was a model?

09:01.578 --> 09:04.346
Um, mostly small stuff.
Okay.

09:04.381 --> 09:06.315
He was starting to work more.

09:06.349 --> 09:08.384
He was actually up
for a national ad.

09:08.418 --> 09:10.920
You're a partner at
an accounting firm?

09:10.954 --> 09:14.890
I pay most of the bills,
if that's what you're asking.

09:14.925 --> 09:16.692
Sean chipped in
where he could.

09:16.726 --> 09:19.361
But we didn't really keep track
of where the money came from.

09:19.396 --> 09:22.064
You don't sound like an
accountant right now.

09:22.098 --> 09:24.567
When you love someone,
you support them.

09:24.601 --> 09:27.136
Do you know if Sean
had any enemies?

09:27.170 --> 09:30.072
No, everybody liked him.

09:30.106 --> 09:32.107
Sounds like you had
a perfect life.

09:32.142 --> 09:33.542
I'm sorry,
is there something wrong

09:33.577 --> 09:35.044
with being happy,

09:35.078 --> 09:37.146
Dr. Sweets?
No.

09:37.180 --> 09:39.515
Now, this is awkward,
Ms. Bardach,

09:39.549 --> 09:42.184
but I need to know your
activities the last three days.

09:42.218 --> 09:43.586
Of course.

09:43.620 --> 09:44.853
I'm an accountant,

09:44.888 --> 09:47.256
so I keep excellent records.

09:47.290 --> 09:49.158
I'm sure, but I-I'm curious,

09:49.192 --> 09:51.393
why didn't you report
Sean missing?

09:51.428 --> 09:52.428
It was simple.

09:52.462 --> 09:53.729
He was on a photo shoot

09:53.763 --> 09:55.197
in Charlotte, North Carolina.

09:55.231 --> 09:57.232
I mean, he traveled
a lot when he worked.

09:58.602 --> 10:01.203
But he always came home.

10:01.237 --> 10:04.239
I always knew
that I would see him again.

10:11.214 --> 10:13.949
Sean Nolan was lying
to his girlfriend.

10:13.984 --> 10:15.985
Booth talked to his agent,
and it turns out

10:16.019 --> 10:18.520
that he had not booked
a modeling job in months.

10:18.555 --> 10:19.755
So where was he going
when he claimed

10:19.789 --> 10:21.256
to be out of town working?

10:21.291 --> 10:22.324
I'm not sure.

10:22.359 --> 10:23.759
I'm running an algorithm

10:23.793 --> 10:25.794
to see if we can break
into his Top Cloud account.

10:25.829 --> 10:27.997
I'm hoping that that'll
tell us something.

10:28.031 --> 10:29.398
Hey, I saw this clip

10:29.432 --> 10:30.733
of you talking
about that other writer

10:30.767 --> 10:32.101
on <i>Book Beat.</i>

10:32.135 --> 10:35.337
Seems like you two are
really getting into it.

10:35.372 --> 10:38.574
So, how would describe
Tess Brown's style?

10:38.608 --> 10:40.776
Uh, based on her last book,

10:40.810 --> 10:42.711
I'd describe it

10:42.746 --> 10:44.780
as a collection

10:44.814 --> 10:47.449
of simple declarative sentences
devoid of style,

10:47.484 --> 10:50.352
actually, and interest.

10:50.387 --> 10:51.920
Do you think that
that was tactless?

10:51.955 --> 10:55.190
Right, you're not kidding.

10:55.225 --> 10:58.360
Brennan, you're blunt.

10:58.395 --> 10:59.962
It's one of the things
I love about you.

10:59.996 --> 11:01.697
That doesn't answer
the question.

11:01.731 --> 11:03.732
Let's try
an experiment.

11:03.767 --> 11:05.634
What do you think
of this dress?

11:08.204 --> 11:10.172
It reminds me
of garments

11:10.206 --> 11:11.974
prostitutes were forced
to wear in shame

11:12.008 --> 11:14.009
under the law
of Lex Julia.

11:14.044 --> 11:15.044
That was tactful.

11:15.078 --> 11:16.011
Thank you.

11:16.046 --> 11:17.980
And also insulting.

11:18.014 --> 11:20.816
Perhaps I should
apologize to Tess Brown.

11:20.850 --> 11:23.519
Yeah, that would definitely
be the tactful thing to do.

11:25.789 --> 11:26.922
Okay...

11:26.956 --> 11:28.657
I'm in.

11:28.692 --> 11:31.927
Okay, we should look at the
last file that Nolan accessed.

11:31.961 --> 11:33.729
"Kids"?

11:33.763 --> 11:35.130
That's Hobart Park.

11:35.165 --> 11:36.532
I've taken
Christine there.

11:36.566 --> 11:39.301
Well, these were taken
with a telephoto lens.

11:39.335 --> 11:42.471
Whoever took them obviously
did not want to be seen.

11:42.505 --> 11:44.139
The victim didn't
have any children.

11:44.174 --> 11:47.409
Okay, then that makes these
extra creepy.

11:51.414 --> 11:53.148
These hermaphroditic
little dudes

11:53.183 --> 11:55.918
start with 2.5 hours
of foreplay, right?

11:55.952 --> 11:59.221
Then they have highly acrobatic
sex lasting over an hour.

11:59.255 --> 12:01.190
But, you know,
they usually take a break.

12:01.224 --> 12:02.591
I know I would.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.093
Man, are you really going
to give birth to a bug?

12:04.127 --> 12:07.196
Because I saw <i>The Fly,</i>
and it did not end well.

12:07.230 --> 12:08.964
It's perfectly safe, okay?

12:08.998 --> 12:11.834
You know, I've devoted my life
to these creatures,

12:11.868 --> 12:14.136
and now one is
depending on me.

12:14.170 --> 12:15.537
You do know

12:15.572 --> 12:17.039
that I'm going
to have to actually

12:17.073 --> 12:18.707
grind up these slugs?
I mean...

12:18.742 --> 12:21.009
I guess... I don't know, man.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.779
I feel like I'm...
I'm giving a little back.

12:25.081 --> 12:28.417
I hate to say it,
but it almost makes sense.

12:29.719 --> 12:31.587
These guys must have
ingested something

12:31.621 --> 12:32.921
to go at it like this.

12:32.956 --> 12:34.356
You know, methamphetamines
have been known

12:34.390 --> 12:35.824
to cause extreme
sexual behavior.

12:35.859 --> 12:37.192
Well, I guess
you'll know

12:37.227 --> 12:38.293
once you grind up
these little guys.

12:38.328 --> 12:39.728
Yeah, I know.

12:39.763 --> 12:41.497
I just wanted them
to have their little fun first.

12:41.531 --> 12:42.831
Oh, well, that's
very considerate of you.

12:42.866 --> 12:44.099
What can I say?

12:44.134 --> 12:45.901
I'm a romantic.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.272
- Still no weapon?
- Not yet.

12:50.306 --> 12:52.040
We're still cataloguing
all of the injuries.

12:52.075 --> 12:55.277
There was a lot of damage
from the rocks in the stream.

12:55.311 --> 12:56.745
Booth, I recognize
some of these children

12:56.780 --> 12:58.580
from Nolan's pictures.

12:58.615 --> 13:00.349
Maybe Nolan snatched
one of the kids, you know,

13:00.383 --> 13:01.617
and a mom took him out.

13:01.651 --> 13:02.718
Excuse me, ladies.

13:02.752 --> 13:04.453
FBI Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

13:04.487 --> 13:06.255
This here is my partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

13:06.289 --> 13:08.757
Have any of you...
Do any of you recognize this man?

13:08.792 --> 13:11.593
Uh... no,
he doesn't look familiar.

13:13.329 --> 13:15.464
I'm Allison Stallings,
Can I ask what this is about?

13:15.498 --> 13:16.619
We're investigating
a murder,

13:16.633 --> 13:17.833
and we have
information

13:17.867 --> 13:18.901
that he may have
frequented this park.

13:18.935 --> 13:20.002
Booth...
Yeah?

13:20.036 --> 13:21.770
these three children
exhibit

13:21.805 --> 13:24.006
genetically-based
phenotypic variations

13:24.040 --> 13:25.541
that cannot be
statistically random.

13:25.575 --> 13:26.675
Okay, look, you have
to know by now

13:26.709 --> 13:28.076
I don't understand
what that means.

13:28.111 --> 13:29.845
Uh, excuse me,
are you talking about my son?

13:29.879 --> 13:32.247
Yes. He has what's known
as Darwin's tubercle.

13:32.282 --> 13:33.922
It presents in only 10%
of the population.

13:33.950 --> 13:36.018
Your son and
these children

13:36.052 --> 13:37.586
must share a common parent.

13:37.620 --> 13:39.488
Oh, that.

13:39.522 --> 13:40.455
W-What's so funny?

13:40.490 --> 13:41.456
Nothing, just...

13:41.491 --> 13:43.091
we're the 562 playgroup.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.194
All the kids were fathered
by the same sperm donor:

13:45.228 --> 13:47.162
562 from the Khamu Sperm Bank.

13:47.197 --> 13:48.931
Booth, her son
is also missing

13:48.965 --> 13:50.799
his left lateral
maxillary incisor,

13:50.834 --> 13:51.767
just like Sean Nolan.

13:51.801 --> 13:53.468
So?

13:53.503 --> 13:55.671
Sean Nolan is donor 562.

13:55.705 --> 13:57.472
He's the father
of all these children.

14:02.306 --> 14:04.056
Khamu Sperm Bank
prides itself

14:04.057 --> 14:06.259
on using only
the best genetic donors.

14:06.463 --> 14:08.895
All donors must be
between 18 and 39.

14:08.896 --> 14:09.862
At least five-nine.

14:09.897 --> 14:11.431
Have no significant illness

14:11.465 --> 14:13.132
or family history
of genetic disease,

14:13.167 --> 14:14.901
and produce a laboratory
specimen twice a week

14:14.935 --> 14:16.102
for at least six months.

14:16.136 --> 14:17.637
And Sean Nolan
was one of

14:17.671 --> 14:19.272
your most popular
donors, wasn't he?

14:19.306 --> 14:20.707
Uh... we know
he fathered

14:20.741 --> 14:22.241
at least three children
for your clients.

14:22.276 --> 14:23.810
He was one of
our genius donors.

14:23.844 --> 14:25.545
Which means you could
charge more for his sperm.

14:25.579 --> 14:27.080
Yes.

14:27.114 --> 14:29.415
Our clients pay a premium
for an Ivy League education

14:29.450 --> 14:31.551
and for every inch
over six feet in height.

14:31.585 --> 14:34.420
But it's about more
than money, Dr. Sweets.

14:34.455 --> 14:36.355
Sean's sperm allowed
infertile couples to...

14:36.390 --> 14:40.059
Sean Nolan never went
to Yale, Ms. Lanfranco.

14:40.094 --> 14:42.729
According to our records,
he attended Queens College.

14:42.763 --> 14:44.597
Dropped out
after one semester.

14:46.433 --> 14:48.000
And you knew that.

14:48.035 --> 14:50.336
He provided
false records.

14:50.370 --> 14:51.804
As soon as
we discovered the truth,

14:51.839 --> 14:53.372
we cut him loose.

14:53.407 --> 14:55.675
If this gets out,
it could hurt many couples

14:55.709 --> 14:57.877
who already have children
because of Sean.

14:57.911 --> 14:59.946
Oh, I understand
the emotional consequences.

14:59.980 --> 15:01.981
Being lied to always
affects behavior.

15:02.015 --> 15:03.616
I'm just trying

15:03.650 --> 15:06.419
to determine how violent
that behavior can be.

15:06.453 --> 15:08.554
I'm sorry Sean is dead.

15:08.589 --> 15:10.323
It's devastating.
Yeah.

15:10.357 --> 15:12.024
It is, and I'm
actually surprised

15:12.059 --> 15:14.026
it's taken you
so long to express that.

15:15.696 --> 15:16.963
Am I a suspect now?

15:16.997 --> 15:19.065
No, no. Not now, no.

15:19.099 --> 15:21.734
Um... and we appreciate
how helpful you've been.

15:21.769 --> 15:23.703
So Sean made a lot of
money with you.

15:23.737 --> 15:25.772
He must have been upset
when you let him go.

15:25.806 --> 15:27.774
He knew
he made a mistake.

15:27.808 --> 15:29.142
He understood
the consequences.

15:29.176 --> 15:30.743
And you never
saw him again?

15:30.778 --> 15:32.912
Ours was a business
relationship.

15:32.946 --> 15:34.480
The lab strictly forbids

15:34.515 --> 15:36.682
having a personal
relationship with a donor.

15:36.717 --> 15:38.084
Is there anything further?

15:38.118 --> 15:39.585
I'm sorry
if I upset you.

15:39.620 --> 15:41.154
Well, you did.

15:41.188 --> 15:42.388
Am I free to go?

15:42.422 --> 15:43.790
Yeah, absolutely.

15:47.127 --> 15:48.995
Any word from your pureed slugs

15:49.029 --> 15:50.296
on what caused their orgy?

15:50.330 --> 15:51.564
All I know so far

15:51.598 --> 15:53.132
is that the outer
amino acids

15:53.167 --> 15:54.600
are hydrophilic.

15:54.635 --> 15:57.003
Mass spec is still analyzing
the molecular chains.

15:57.037 --> 15:59.105
Man, that's getting bigger
and definitely nastier.

15:59.139 --> 16:01.674
Yeah, it grows quickly
when it comes to term.

16:01.708 --> 16:04.243
The larva
forms a tumor

16:04.278 --> 16:06.345
in the subcutaneous
zone of the host,

16:06.380 --> 16:08.948
using my flesh to convert itself
into a bot fly.

16:08.982 --> 16:10.650
Yeah, you shouldn't
be excited by anything

16:10.684 --> 16:11.751
that you're saying.

16:11.785 --> 16:13.953
Oh, my God,
it's moving!

16:13.987 --> 16:15.321
Yeah, that means that
the larval development

16:15.355 --> 16:16.789
is almost complete.

16:16.824 --> 16:18.257
When the time comes,

16:18.292 --> 16:19.458
it'll detach
its anal hooks

16:19.493 --> 16:21.327
and slide out
to greet the world.

16:21.361 --> 16:23.596
Dude, you have
totally lost the plot.

16:23.630 --> 16:25.464
Angela is going
to divorce you.

16:25.499 --> 16:26.866
Nah, I know my Angie.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.401
When she sees
this little bot fly...

16:28.435 --> 16:29.802
Listen to yourself!

16:29.837 --> 16:31.838
Mr. Bray,
the victim's femur and tibia

16:31.872 --> 16:33.139
show evidence of thickening.

16:33.173 --> 16:35.174
I know, and based on
the growth striations

16:35.209 --> 16:36.375
at the end of the femur,

16:36.410 --> 16:38.211
it happened within
the last few years.

16:38.245 --> 16:39.612
Taking testosterone
could be the cause.

16:39.646 --> 16:40.880
Yeah, but there's no evidence

16:40.914 --> 16:42.515
the slugs ingested testosterone.

16:42.549 --> 16:44.450
And it makes no sense.

16:44.484 --> 16:45.718
Taking testosterone would

16:45.752 --> 16:47.186
decrease sperm production.

16:47.221 --> 16:49.188
It would be bad
for his business.

16:49.223 --> 16:50.523
Dr. Hodgins,

16:50.557 --> 16:52.859
it appears you're
almost to term.

16:52.893 --> 16:55.394
Congratulations.
Thanks, Dr. B.

16:55.429 --> 16:57.897
This doesn't freak you out,
even a little?

16:57.931 --> 16:59.332
He's in no danger.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.334
And Dr. Hodgins'
love of entomology

17:01.368 --> 17:03.536
makes his desire
to be an insect's host

17:03.570 --> 17:04.604
quite reasonable.
Yeah.

17:04.637 --> 17:05.637
Take cross sections

17:05.672 --> 17:07.473
from the femur, Mr. Bray.

17:07.507 --> 17:09.375
Perhaps the chemicals
contained in the marrow

17:09.409 --> 17:11.877
will match what Dr. Hodgins
finds in the slugs.

17:11.912 --> 17:13.646
I'll be back later.

17:14.714 --> 17:17.016
Call me when you get
the results.

17:17.050 --> 17:19.085
Uh, Wendell?
Um...

17:19.118 --> 17:21.253
Truthfully, Angie is

17:21.288 --> 17:22.454
a little unsupportive

17:22.489 --> 17:23.955
of me being
a bot fly surrogate.

17:23.991 --> 17:25.825
What a shock.
So I was wondering

17:25.858 --> 17:27.226
if you wouldn't mind
being with me

17:27.261 --> 17:28.527
when the little guy
comes out?

17:28.561 --> 17:30.963
You want me
to be your midwife?

17:30.998 --> 17:32.965
I was thinking more like
birthing partner.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.433
I'm going insane.

17:34.468 --> 17:36.135
Oh, also, uh...

17:36.169 --> 17:39.138
if you wouldn't mind taking
a video of the big event?

17:39.172 --> 17:41.007
<i>So the head of the sperm bank</i>

17:41.041 --> 17:42.408
<i>was definitely not forthcoming.</i>

17:42.442 --> 17:43.743
So you think
it was her?

17:43.777 --> 17:44.911
Well, it's too
early to say.

17:44.945 --> 17:46.846
Yeah. Of course it is.
But...

17:46.880 --> 17:48.981
Nolan must have angered
a lot of people.

17:49.016 --> 17:50.783
You know? He-he suffered
from a narcissistic

17:50.817 --> 17:53.286
ego structure,
hence his desire

17:53.320 --> 17:55.955
to literally replicate himself
through his progeny.

17:55.989 --> 17:58.024
How would that piss people off?
Well, in his case,

17:58.058 --> 18:00.559
reproduction meant a stab
at immortality.

18:00.594 --> 18:03.129
Anyone who got in his way
would be perceived as a threat

18:03.163 --> 18:04.764
to himself and his legacy.

18:04.798 --> 18:06.265
That creates conflict.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.734
Conflict begets murder.
Biblical. Nice.

18:08.769 --> 18:12.204
So, how's Dr. Brennan
doing, uh, with her feud?

18:12.239 --> 18:13.572
Putting it to rest.
You know, I'm proud of her.

18:13.607 --> 18:15.675
She's apologizing?
Yeah. This afternoon.

18:15.709 --> 18:17.677
I must be a good influence.
Or what about the parents?

18:17.711 --> 18:19.578
Excuse me?
The case.

18:19.613 --> 18:21.133
This murder case
that we're working on?

18:21.148 --> 18:22.915
Oh, right, right, right.

18:22.950 --> 18:25.084
What if one of the parents
who bought Nolan's stuff

18:25.118 --> 18:26.485
found out that he was lying?

18:26.520 --> 18:28.020
That would definitely be motive.
Definitely.

18:28.055 --> 18:30.089
Questioning his integrity
could start a fight.

18:30.123 --> 18:32.325
Even though he was lying.
Especially because he was lying.

18:32.359 --> 18:35.261
A narcissistic ego
is extremely fragile.

18:35.295 --> 18:36.262
Mm.

18:37.764 --> 18:40.299
Today on <i>Book Beat,</i>
two writers

18:40.334 --> 18:42.969
whose work mines
similar territory:

18:43.003 --> 18:44.937
mystery writers
Tess Brown,

18:44.972 --> 18:47.907
author of the just released
<i>Bed of Death,</i>

18:47.941 --> 18:49.675
and Dr. Temperance Brennan,

18:49.710 --> 18:51.610
whose <i>Bones of the Lost</i>
is coming out

18:51.645 --> 18:53.879
- next month.
- It's great to be here, Bill.

18:53.914 --> 18:55.381
My daughter loves your show.
Oh.

18:55.415 --> 18:57.750
I don't allow my daughter
to watch television.

18:57.784 --> 18:59.552
Of course, Ms. Brown
is much older,

18:59.586 --> 19:01.754
so I'm sure her daughter
is more than two.

19:01.788 --> 19:03.789
I seem older to you
because I married well before

19:03.824 --> 19:05.191
the end
of my childbearing years.

19:05.225 --> 19:06.692
No need to be angry.

19:06.727 --> 19:08.627
Age is an immutable fact.

19:08.662 --> 19:09.662
I came here

19:09.696 --> 19:11.530
to reach a rapheme.

19:11.565 --> 19:12.999
Okay. Um, uh, Tess,

19:13.033 --> 19:15.735
your book is
just out this week.

19:15.769 --> 19:17.636
What has the response been?
Wonderful.

19:17.671 --> 19:20.773
I've had overwhelming support
from the blogging community,

19:20.807 --> 19:22.942
book clubs,
other authors.

19:22.976 --> 19:24.744
Not Dr. Brennan, of course.

19:24.778 --> 19:27.046
And for that,
I would like to apologize.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.214
I feel that

19:28.248 --> 19:29.648
I was misinterpreted

19:29.683 --> 19:31.984
and my statement
was misconstrued

19:32.019 --> 19:34.420
as callous and tactless.

19:34.454 --> 19:37.156
Really? Uh, well,
this is a surprise.

19:37.190 --> 19:39.158
I assume you accept her apology.

19:39.192 --> 19:40.326
Uh, well,
what did you mean then?

19:40.360 --> 19:41.293
I think the apology is enough.

19:41.328 --> 19:42.862
I meant that it is

19:42.896 --> 19:44.997
extremely difficult
to write a cogent novel

19:45.032 --> 19:47.833
that mixes fact with fiction
in a way that captures

19:47.868 --> 19:49.168
a reader's attention.

19:49.202 --> 19:50.523
And are you implying
that I don't?

19:50.537 --> 19:51.537
Because I have
three best-selling books

19:51.571 --> 19:53.005
that say otherwise.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.775
And I have six.
But that's not the point.

19:55.809 --> 19:58.477
Hemingway said that
we are all apprentices

19:58.512 --> 20:00.980
in a craft where no one
ever becomes a master.

20:01.014 --> 20:03.149
Excellent. Excellent.
Um, uh, Tess, um,

20:03.183 --> 20:06.619
how did you come up with
the plot of your newest book?

20:06.653 --> 20:09.388
The idea came to me last summer,
when I was in Wales.

20:09.423 --> 20:11.090
Oh.

20:11.124 --> 20:12.625
"Oh"?

20:12.659 --> 20:13.959
I thought it came
to you while reading

20:13.994 --> 20:15.694
<i>The Murder of</i>
<i>Roger Ackroyd,</i>

20:15.729 --> 20:17.063
by Agatha Christie.

20:17.097 --> 20:19.065
It's one of my favorites, too.

20:19.099 --> 20:21.567
My readers love the book.

20:21.601 --> 20:23.469
<i>Roger Ackroyd</i>
or yours?

20:23.503 --> 20:24.870
Uh, one more question,
Ms. Brown...

20:24.905 --> 20:26.939
I'm reminded
of a quote by

20:26.973 --> 20:28.340
Ray Bradbury, who said,

20:28.375 --> 20:30.176
"I don't need an alarm clock.

20:30.210 --> 20:31.977
My ideas wake me."

20:32.012 --> 20:34.847
I assume you're a sound sleeper,
Dr. Brennan.

20:34.881 --> 20:38.350
Now I believe you owe <i>me</i>
an apology, Ms. Brown.

20:39.853 --> 20:42.154
I'd rather read your drivel
than apologize.

20:42.189 --> 20:44.190
I'm pretty sure
that was tactless.

20:44.224 --> 20:46.392
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Wise?

20:51.832 --> 20:54.733
I was able to separate the bone
injuries into two categories:

20:54.768 --> 20:56.702
blunt and sharp force trauma.

20:56.736 --> 20:58.704
The blunt force trauma
occurred postmortem,

20:58.738 --> 21:00.806
most likely due
to the fall down the hill.

21:00.841 --> 21:03.776
Or the body hitting the rocks
as it washed downstream.

21:03.810 --> 21:06.245
Definitely, but based
on the blood staining,

21:06.279 --> 21:09.148
these sharp force injuries
to the posterior carpals,

21:09.182 --> 21:12.518
metacarpals, proximal phalanges,
radius and ulna

21:12.552 --> 21:14.086
are perimortem.

21:14.121 --> 21:15.855
Most likely defensive wounds.

21:15.889 --> 21:18.057
Nolan fought with his killer.
And the cuts

21:18.091 --> 21:20.426
show that the assailant was
wielding a weapon of some sort.

21:20.460 --> 21:21.727
Nolan didn't stand a chance.

21:21.761 --> 21:23.095
It was testosterone that caused

21:23.130 --> 21:25.097
the bone thickening.
That was ruled out.

21:25.132 --> 21:26.899
It would've decreased
sperm production.

21:26.933 --> 21:28.234
Artificial testosterone, yes,

21:28.268 --> 21:30.302
but this was naturally produced
by Nolan.

21:30.337 --> 21:32.338
No one produces
as much as he did.

21:32.372 --> 21:35.107
Well, they do
if they're taking HCG.

21:35.142 --> 21:38.410
Of course.
The fertility drug.

21:38.445 --> 21:40.946
It would cause the body to naturally
increase testosterone production.

21:40.981 --> 21:42.848
Yeah, as well as
his sperm count.

21:42.883 --> 21:45.317
And cause your slugs
to go out with a bang.

21:45.352 --> 21:46.785
So to speak.

21:46.820 --> 21:48.354
But if he'd been fired
from the sperm bank,

21:48.388 --> 21:49.955
why keep taking HCG?

21:49.990 --> 21:52.791
There are other banks,
other ways to sell his seed.

21:52.826 --> 21:54.093
Yeah, but look
at the formulation.

21:54.127 --> 21:56.629
I mean, this HCG
was far from pure.

21:56.663 --> 21:58.303
He must have been buying it
on the street.

21:58.331 --> 22:00.266
It's sold at a lot of gyms,
to bodybuilders,

22:00.300 --> 22:03.335
to redistribute body fat
and increase testosterone.

22:03.370 --> 22:05.137
We know he was in a fight.

22:05.172 --> 22:07.306
Maybe it wasn't the prospective
parents who wanted him dead.

22:07.340 --> 22:09.441
Maybe it was his drug dealer.

22:13.225 --> 22:15.727
I was Sean's trainer
at the gym, that's all.

22:15.911 --> 22:17.812
You got three arrests on you,
Creach, okay?

22:17.846 --> 22:19.180
One for selling
illegal steroids,

22:19.214 --> 22:20.781
the other one
for human growth hormones

22:20.816 --> 22:22.717
and one for selling
amphetamines.

22:22.751 --> 22:24.218
I'm clean now.

22:24.253 --> 22:26.020
That's why the court sentenced
me to treatment,

22:26.054 --> 22:28.689
because they knew I was a good
guy who had a problem.

22:28.724 --> 22:31.459
You've a bigger problem now,
because Sean Nolan is dead.

22:31.493 --> 22:33.728
I'm gonna miss him.

22:33.762 --> 22:35.563
He was really getting
into good shape.

22:35.597 --> 22:37.932
Right, and you did
what you always do,

22:37.966 --> 22:39.133
and that's sell him drugs.

22:39.167 --> 22:40.534
This time it was HCG.

22:40.569 --> 22:42.303
I don't know even know
what that is.

22:42.337 --> 22:44.639
And I'm pretty sure
you didn't find any drugs

22:44.673 --> 22:46.741
at my place,
when you searched it.

22:46.775 --> 22:48.643
He did owe you money,
though, right?

22:48.677 --> 22:50.411
Yeah, as a trainer.

22:50.445 --> 22:52.680
It ain't cheap
to look like me.

22:52.714 --> 22:54.916
Look, um, I'm sorry about Sean
and all, but, um,

22:54.950 --> 22:56.550
I got a client at 2:00,

22:56.585 --> 22:59.720
and you got nothing on me
or I'd be in a cell.

23:01.123 --> 23:03.024
Excuse me.
We're not done now.

23:03.058 --> 23:04.792
Oh, wow.
You want to take this on?

23:04.826 --> 23:05.927
Seriously?

23:07.362 --> 23:09.330
Oh! Okay, here's
the biggest problem

23:09.364 --> 23:11.165
with guys that are pumped
up on 'roids, huh.

23:11.199 --> 23:12.566
They look bigger,
but they're a lot dumber.

23:12.601 --> 23:14.201
Stop! Stop!

23:14.236 --> 23:17.505
You twisted up Sean's arm so bad
three months ago, that you broke it.

23:17.539 --> 23:20.107
We have witnesses.
We were roughhousing. Aah!

23:20.142 --> 23:23.044
Look, you don't want to get
locked up for assaulting

23:23.078 --> 23:25.146
a federal agent, you tell me
about what happened

23:25.180 --> 23:26.647
between you and Sean.

23:26.682 --> 23:28.950
We-We got into it a little bit,
that's all.

23:28.984 --> 23:30.418
He said the HCG wasn't good,

23:30.452 --> 23:31.986
that's why he didn't have
the money.

23:32.020 --> 23:34.088
Some guy was refusing to pay him
for his sperm

23:34.122 --> 23:35.456
because his wife wasn't
getting pregnant.

23:35.490 --> 23:36.390
Sean blamed me.

23:36.425 --> 23:38.092
What guy?

23:38.126 --> 23:40.861
I don't know. I swear.
I swear.

23:47.336 --> 23:49.403
I initially thought
that the injuries

23:49.438 --> 23:50.972
to the pelvis and femur
were caused by

23:51.006 --> 23:53.074
the fall down the hill,
but look at these cuts

23:53.108 --> 23:54.508
on the cortical surfaces.

23:54.543 --> 23:57.745
The deepest gash is
on the right proximal femur.

23:57.779 --> 24:00.314
A cut deep enough
to score the bone

24:00.349 --> 24:01.782
would have severed
the femoral artery.

24:01.817 --> 24:03.884
Meaning our victim would
have bled out.

24:03.919 --> 24:05.820
He'd lose consciousness
in 30 seconds.

24:05.854 --> 24:07.088
Any idea what
weapon was used?

24:07.122 --> 24:08.522
Not yet.
If it was a knife,

24:08.557 --> 24:09.857
it would have
been very dull.

24:09.891 --> 24:11.792
Any other evidence
of stabbing or slashing?

24:11.827 --> 24:15.696
Just the defensive wounds and
these three cuts on the pelvis,

24:15.731 --> 24:18.232
two on the femur.

24:18.266 --> 24:20.701
So whoever killed Sean Nolan
knew to target this area

24:20.736 --> 24:22.670
to kill him quickly
and efficiently.

24:22.704 --> 24:23.904
Meaning someone with more than

24:23.939 --> 24:25.306
a working knowledge of anatomy.

24:25.996 --> 24:28.598
Good work, Mr. Bray.
You found cause of death.

24:28.632 --> 24:30.199
Now all we need is a weapon.

24:33.537 --> 24:36.439
I assume you're
a sound sleeper, Dr. Brennan.

24:36.473 --> 24:39.575
Now I believe you owe <i>me</i>
an apology, Ms. Brown.

24:41.045 --> 24:42.845
I'd rather read your drivel
than apologize.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.647
I'm pretty
sure that was tactless.

24:44.682 --> 24:46.516
I saw you on TV.

24:46.550 --> 24:49.052
Okay, before you start lecturing
me on my behavior,

24:49.086 --> 24:50.486
she provoked me.

24:50.521 --> 24:51.454
I agree.

24:51.488 --> 24:52.955
You do?

24:52.990 --> 24:54.190
Absolutely.

24:54.224 --> 24:55.958
If you review the tape,
it's clear.

24:55.993 --> 24:57.260
She was baiting you.

24:57.294 --> 24:58.695
I never should have gone.

24:58.729 --> 25:00.863
But she asked me,
and I thought it would be

25:00.898 --> 25:02.198
a good opportunity to apologize.

25:02.232 --> 25:03.499
Exactly. She also asked you

25:03.534 --> 25:05.368
for a quote
about her book, right?

25:05.402 --> 25:06.669
Now, why would Tess Brown think

25:06.704 --> 25:08.204
you'd give her
a favorable review?

25:08.238 --> 25:10.073
I'm brilliant, perceptive,

25:10.107 --> 25:12.642
and I have outsold her
consistently.

25:12.676 --> 25:15.144
No. She wanted to start
the feud with you.

25:15.179 --> 25:16.979
Sweets, if this is some more
psychological claptrap,

25:17.014 --> 25:19.482
I don't...
It's logic.

25:19.516 --> 25:21.417
She knows you don't think
she's a good novelist.

25:21.452 --> 25:22.452
She also knows
that you're incapable

25:22.486 --> 25:24.120
of sugarcoating the truth.

25:24.154 --> 25:27.256
Is that just another way
of saying that I'm tactless?

25:27.291 --> 25:29.459
We can get into all that later.

25:29.493 --> 25:32.595
Logic dictates that
she wanted you to insult her

25:32.629 --> 25:35.398
and also that she didn't
really want an apology.

25:35.432 --> 25:37.233
This is deliberate
and calculated behavior.

25:37.267 --> 25:38.868
She has an endgame.

25:38.902 --> 25:41.604
She's using you to get there.

25:45.275 --> 25:48.511
The wound tracks are
thick and irregular.

25:48.545 --> 25:50.913
A deep wide V to the
left fifth metacarpal,

25:50.948 --> 25:52.348
right phalanges
and metacarpals,

25:52.382 --> 25:54.784
left ilium and
right femur.

25:54.818 --> 25:57.553
So, we're looking for a weapon
that's sharp, but not too sharp,

25:57.588 --> 26:00.656
a knife, but not a knife,
or an ax, but not an ax.

26:00.691 --> 26:02.792
Ah, that should take us
about 50 or 60 years.

26:02.826 --> 26:04.227
There's more.

26:04.261 --> 26:05.762
Sure. Why make it easy?
The injuries

26:05.796 --> 26:07.263
to the left pisiform,
left hamate

26:07.297 --> 26:09.532
and the anterior superior
of the iliac spine

26:09.566 --> 26:11.901
have a narrow,
shallow, slicing V

26:11.935 --> 26:14.737
which is consistent with
the blade of a knife.

26:14.772 --> 26:16.272
So, two killers?
Looks that way.

26:16.306 --> 26:18.186
All right, well,
grab a weapon, let's get going.

26:18.208 --> 26:19.976
Ready?
Yeah.

26:20.010 --> 26:21.677
Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah!
What? Are you okay?

26:21.712 --> 26:23.246
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.648
It's just... it's just
the bot fly.

26:25.682 --> 26:27.784
Oh, my God!
It's peeking out!

26:27.818 --> 26:30.086
Is it... is it time?
Should I boil some water, or...?

26:30.120 --> 26:31.760
No, no, no, no, no.
I still got some time.

26:31.789 --> 26:33.623
Hey, let's solve this murder
so that we can celebrate

26:33.657 --> 26:35.024
when the little guy arrives.

26:35.058 --> 26:36.926
What...?

26:36.960 --> 26:39.462
No local
sperm bank has a donor

26:39.496 --> 26:42.198
matching Sean Nolan's
description or DNA profile.

26:42.232 --> 26:44.433
Why would he still
be taking the HCG

26:44.468 --> 26:46.135
if he wasn't still donating?

26:46.170 --> 26:49.138
Well, he was, but he decided
to go into business for himself.

26:49.173 --> 26:52.008
What, like a
roadside sperm stand?

26:52.042 --> 26:53.075
Almost.

26:53.110 --> 26:55.511
Nolan was selling

26:55.546 --> 26:58.247
his sperm online?
Yup.

26:58.282 --> 27:00.817
Same lies about being in
MENSA, going to Yale.

27:00.851 --> 27:03.519
But lucky for us,
he kept meticulous records.

27:03.554 --> 27:05.755
His TopCloud account
tracks sperm count,

27:05.789 --> 27:07.824
delivery location--

27:07.858 --> 27:10.026
the rest stop above
the stream being one--

27:10.060 --> 27:11.727
even his offspring.

27:11.762 --> 27:14.297
And then, there's these.

27:14.331 --> 27:16.265
Apparently,
one of his customers

27:16.300 --> 27:18.334
was not too thrilled
with his product.

27:18.368 --> 27:19.669
The guy's wife
didn't get pregnant,

27:19.703 --> 27:21.270
and he blamed Nolan.

27:21.305 --> 27:22.972
That could be the angry customer

27:23.006 --> 27:24.807
his trainer was talking about.

27:24.842 --> 27:26.375
And then,
he threatened to kill Nolan

27:26.410 --> 27:27.743
for selling him bad sperm.

27:37.678 --> 27:39.017
<i>So, I understand</i>

27:39.018 --> 27:40.485
the emotional toll it can take

27:40.520 --> 27:42.587
when a couple is unable
to conceive, Mr. Robertson.

27:42.622 --> 27:44.022
I didn't come to the FBI

27:44.056 --> 27:45.891
for-for therapy, so
is there a real reason

27:45.925 --> 27:47.292
you called me in here?

27:47.326 --> 27:48.860
It's sort of linked.

27:48.895 --> 27:50.729
Now you contacted a sperm donor
named Sean Nolan, right?

27:50.763 --> 27:51.930
Is that illegal?

27:51.964 --> 27:54.032
No. But murder is.

27:54.066 --> 27:56.701
He was found dumped
in a stream off Route 34.

27:56.736 --> 27:59.738
And... you-you think that...?

27:59.772 --> 28:02.207
Sean seemed
to be your last hope. At least,

28:02.241 --> 28:04.943
that's what you said
in your e-mails.

28:04.977 --> 28:07.012
Wait. N...

28:07.046 --> 28:10.682
Dina and I have been trying
to have a kid for a long time,

28:10.716 --> 28:14.286
and be... between artificial
insemination, in vitro

28:14.320 --> 28:15.887
and fertility treatments...

28:15.922 --> 28:17.789
we spent all of our money,

28:17.824 --> 28:20.292
and the last of it went...
went to Nolan.

28:20.326 --> 28:21.827
No. I understand.

28:21.861 --> 28:23.929
Anger is a byproduct
of unrealized expectations.

28:23.963 --> 28:26.498
Now, this leads
to processing biases

28:26.532 --> 28:28.900
and emotion regulation deficits.
What the hell are you saying?

28:28.935 --> 28:31.970
That Sean Nolan promised you
and your wife a life,

28:32.004 --> 28:33.572
and he didn't deliver.

28:33.606 --> 28:35.373
A life for a life doesn't seem
too unreasonable.

28:35.408 --> 28:37.209
At least, that's what
you said in your e-mail.

28:37.243 --> 28:39.411
Yeah, people say,
"I'll kill you" all the time.

28:39.445 --> 28:41.780
Yeah, but in this case,
someone actually turned up dead.

28:41.814 --> 28:43.248
Yeah, well,
if I was gonna kill someone,

28:43.282 --> 28:44.616
it would've been the lady

28:44.650 --> 28:46.017
from the sperm bank
that recommended him,

28:46.052 --> 28:48.186
because he wasn't
a Yale graduate.

28:48.221 --> 28:50.589
He was dumb as a stump.

28:50.623 --> 28:52.691
What sperm bank?
Khamu.

28:52.725 --> 28:54.793
Judith Lanfranco?
Yeah.

28:54.827 --> 28:57.596
She said
she was doing us a favor.

29:00.032 --> 29:01.466
Hey, check this out.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.001
Think I found the murder weapon.

29:03.035 --> 29:05.937
It's a three-edged hoe.
Three blades.

29:05.972 --> 29:07.606
That's why we thought there was
more than one assailant.

29:07.640 --> 29:10.275
The deep cuts came from
the front edge of the hoe,

29:10.309 --> 29:12.310
and the slices were caused
by the glancing blows

29:12.345 --> 29:13.879
from the sides of the blade.

29:13.913 --> 29:16.514
And this type of hoe is used
by the Highway Department.

29:16.549 --> 29:19.117
There used to be one in the
rest stop where Nolan was found.

29:19.151 --> 29:21.052
It's missing.
It has been since the murder.

29:21.087 --> 29:23.622
A weapon of convenience.

29:23.656 --> 29:24.931
So, the murder
wasn't premeditated.

29:24.932 --> 29:27.047
No.
Whoever did this got angry,

29:27.159 --> 29:29.327
grabbed the first thing
they could find and attacked.

29:29.362 --> 29:31.396
Nice work. You should be
host to bugs all the time.

29:31.430 --> 29:33.465
They really, uh, motivate you.

29:33.499 --> 29:36.134
Oh, look.
He's peeking out again.

29:36.168 --> 29:37.669
Hey, little guy.

29:37.703 --> 29:40.205
Oh, man... this is
becoming normal to me.

29:43.042 --> 29:44.509
So, it turns out,

29:44.543 --> 29:46.878
selling your seed online
is more common than I thought.

29:46.913 --> 29:49.514
Well, there are so many people
desperate to have children.

29:49.548 --> 29:51.516
Perhaps I should think
about being a surrogate.

29:51.550 --> 29:53.251
What? Whoa!
Okay, s-slow down.

29:53.286 --> 29:55.654
Let's just solve the case first,
before you start having,

29:55.688 --> 29:57.088
you know,
kids for strangers.

29:57.123 --> 29:58.556
No, you're right.

29:58.591 --> 30:00.191
I'm already busy as it is.

30:00.226 --> 30:02.460
And since they moved up
the release of my book...

30:02.495 --> 30:04.729
Oh-oh, hey, when
did that happen?

30:04.764 --> 30:06.131
I just got a call
from my editor.

30:06.165 --> 30:07.966
Apparently,
there was so much publicity

30:08.000 --> 30:09.467
from the misunderstanding with
Tess Brown that they thought

30:09.502 --> 30:11.136
this would be a good time
to release my book.

30:11.170 --> 30:12.470
Thank you.
See that?

30:12.505 --> 30:15.073
There is a silver lining,
Bones, huh?

30:15.107 --> 30:18.343
Why would the head of the sperm
clinic recommend Nolan

30:18.377 --> 30:20.512
when she knows
that he's a fraud?

30:20.546 --> 30:22.714
You know, I thought she was
getting some kind of a kickback,

30:22.748 --> 30:24.182
so I had forensic accounting

30:24.216 --> 30:26.284
check out Judith Lanfranco's
financials,

30:26.319 --> 30:29.187
and the result is not
what I expected.

30:29.221 --> 30:33.291
He wasn't paying her,
she was paying him.

30:33.326 --> 30:35.060
Perhaps he was blackmailing her.

30:35.094 --> 30:38.430
And she got tired of paying, and
she decided to stop it for good.

30:39.966 --> 30:42.534
Now that we have the weapon
and all the perimortem injuries,

30:42.568 --> 30:45.904
I can input all the information
and get us an attack scenario.

30:45.938 --> 30:47.639
There was a lot
of damage

30:47.673 --> 30:49.274
to the hands and arms,
so it's very clear

30:49.275 --> 30:51.209
that Nolan was trying
to fight off his attacker.

30:51.243 --> 30:52.711
Yeah, but what's
strange is that

30:52.745 --> 30:54.145
all the injuries
are isolated

30:54.180 --> 30:56.781
to the hands, forearms
and pelvic area.

30:56.816 --> 30:57.949
Yeah, you'd think
you would aim at the head

30:57.984 --> 30:59.317
if you were trying
to kill someone, huh?

30:59.352 --> 31:01.419
Yeah, unless we're
missing something.

31:01.454 --> 31:03.455
Angie...

31:03.489 --> 31:05.090
Yeah?
Listen, I didn't

31:05.124 --> 31:07.158
want to upset you, you know,
with the bot fly, but...

31:07.193 --> 31:08.760
You don't have to
say anything, honey.

31:08.794 --> 31:10.562
I understand.

31:10.596 --> 31:13.665
Really?
No. No, I do not.

31:13.699 --> 31:15.600
But... I accept it.

31:15.634 --> 31:17.702
We're all a
little crazy, and

31:17.737 --> 31:19.237
your crazy just happens

31:19.271 --> 31:22.574
to come out
in a bizarre and revolting way.

31:22.608 --> 31:24.576
I actually think
it's kind of sweet

31:24.610 --> 31:26.511
that you want to
give life to that...

31:26.545 --> 31:27.846
thing.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.080
Wow.

31:29.115 --> 31:31.549
I am the luckiest man
in the world.

31:31.584 --> 31:32.984
Mm. You're not kidding.

31:34.253 --> 31:37.055
Oh, God! Oh, it came out.

31:37.089 --> 31:39.090
Well, yeah, yeah.
No, just for some air. I mean,

31:39.125 --> 31:40.525
it's still got
some time left.

31:40.559 --> 31:42.093
Okay. God. Shh.

31:42.128 --> 31:43.661
Did I just erase
what I input?

31:43.696 --> 31:45.330
Okay, honey, I love you,

31:45.364 --> 31:48.800
but I really just want
to love you from afar right now.

31:48.834 --> 31:50.635
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
I love you, too.

31:50.669 --> 31:53.405
From afar.
From afar. Yeah, I'm gonna...

31:53.439 --> 31:56.307
From afar.

31:56.342 --> 31:58.109
So, did Sean threaten
to expose you?

31:58.144 --> 31:59.511
He could have ruined
your business

31:59.545 --> 32:01.513
if he had made
his fraud public.

32:01.547 --> 32:02.747
Sean would never do that.

32:02.782 --> 32:03.948
Then why were
you paying him?

32:03.983 --> 32:05.383
I was just loaning him money.

32:05.418 --> 32:07.018
Modeling was slow,

32:07.053 --> 32:09.187
and he didn't make all that much
as an online donor.

32:09.221 --> 32:12.157
You're extremely generous
for someone he lied to.

32:12.191 --> 32:14.659
He made a mistake.
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

32:14.693 --> 32:16.694
Not one
that would get me killed.

32:18.197 --> 32:20.165
I know what happened, Booth.

32:20.199 --> 32:22.167
She's pregnant.
What?

32:22.201 --> 32:23.802
Yes. You see the redness

32:23.836 --> 32:26.504
of her triangular fossa,
the swelling in her wrists

32:26.539 --> 32:28.807
and hands,
the size of her breasts?

32:28.841 --> 32:30.275
That's why you protected him.

32:30.309 --> 32:32.043
You were referring clients
to him.

32:32.078 --> 32:35.313
You used Sean Nolan as a donor.

32:39.351 --> 32:42.253
We made love.

32:42.288 --> 32:43.721
Sean I

32:43.756 --> 32:45.290
were in love.

32:45.324 --> 32:47.525
I couldn't say anything,
or I'd lose my job.

32:47.560 --> 32:48.993
Did you know
he had a girlfriend?

32:49.028 --> 32:50.895
Yes, but he loved me.

32:50.930 --> 32:52.764
He was going to tell her.

32:52.798 --> 32:54.766
And you believed him,
even after he lied

32:54.800 --> 32:56.201
about being a genius?

32:56.235 --> 32:58.103
He had no more secrets.

32:58.137 --> 32:59.838
Not from me.

32:59.872 --> 33:03.608
And he was finally going
to have a child of his own.

33:03.642 --> 33:05.762
We were going
to raise him together.

33:11.050 --> 33:13.418
I've highlighted
the perimortem injuries in red.

33:13.452 --> 33:16.054
Now, we thought
that the injuries to the hands

33:16.088 --> 33:18.056
and the forearms
were caused when he fought

33:18.090 --> 33:20.091
with the attacker,
but... watch this.

33:20.126 --> 33:22.961
See? Two of the cuts line up.

33:22.995 --> 33:24.729
Uh-oh.
Ooh. Ouch.

33:24.763 --> 33:27.198
Yeah. The victim wasn't
fighting with his killer.

33:27.233 --> 33:29.334
- Looks like he was protecting himself.
- Whoever did this

33:29.368 --> 33:31.236
was going after
Nolan's livelihood.

33:31.270 --> 33:32.804
I made a little simulation

33:32.838 --> 33:35.306
to show what might have happened
during the attack.

33:35.341 --> 33:37.308
Not sure I can watch this.

33:46.552 --> 33:49.672
The killer slices
the femoral artery and Nolan bleeds out.

33:49.673 --> 33:51.835
Well, it's definitely not
the husband or the trainer.

33:52.158 --> 33:53.258
How can you be so sure?

33:53.292 --> 33:54.692
'Cause no guy did this.

33:54.727 --> 33:56.561
That's assumptive
and sexist.

33:56.595 --> 34:00.532
I agree, but...
it's also probably true.

34:00.566 --> 34:02.834
I mean, think about it:
there's nothing worse

34:02.868 --> 34:06.237
than a woman scorned who has
access to a three-sided hoe.

34:10.743 --> 34:12.754
You brought Nolan's girlfriend
back in for questioning?

34:12.779 --> 34:14.059
Seems like the right move, okay?

34:14.060 --> 34:15.860
Evidence says that this
is a crime of passion,

34:15.896 --> 34:17.730
most likely committed
by a woman.

34:17.764 --> 34:20.165
So you think the girlfriend
found out about Nolan's affair

34:20.199 --> 34:21.467
with the sperm
bank manager.

34:21.501 --> 34:23.735
Flipped her lid
and hacked him up, okay?

34:23.770 --> 34:25.938
If I was still gambling...
 tell you what,

34:25.972 --> 34:28.741
- I'd put all my money on her.
<i>- You said</i>

34:28.775 --> 34:30.643
your relationship with Sean
was based on mutual trust?

34:30.677 --> 34:32.356
Yes. Why?

34:32.380 --> 34:34.213
So you do realize he was
selling sperm on the Internet?

34:34.214 --> 34:35.681
Of course I do.

34:35.715 --> 34:37.882
I took the picture
he used for his ad.

34:37.918 --> 34:40.085
You were okay with that?
Why wouldn't I be? It's...

34:40.120 --> 34:42.054
how he supplemented his income.

34:42.088 --> 34:44.590
Would you be okay if you
found out Sean had an affair?

34:44.623 --> 34:46.625
I know where this is going.

34:46.659 --> 34:48.994
Really?
Mm-hmm. That sperm bank woman, right?

34:49.029 --> 34:50.166
Yeah.

34:50.190 --> 34:52.563
When we find out a sacred
trust has been broken,

34:52.565 --> 34:53.732
it can be devastating.
Sometimes

34:53.766 --> 34:54.934
it makes us do things

34:54.967 --> 34:56.168
that we wouldn't normally do.

34:56.202 --> 34:58.103
I knew all about it.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.139
We talked. We cried.

35:00.173 --> 35:01.740
We got past it.

35:01.775 --> 35:03.375
Did he tell you
that they were having a baby,

35:03.410 --> 35:05.911
that they were gonna raise
a child together?

35:10.684 --> 35:12.885
I'm-I'm missing

35:12.919 --> 35:14.987
what's funny here.
I'm sorry.

35:15.021 --> 35:16.021
That's not funny.

35:16.056 --> 35:18.057
She's exhibiting

35:18.091 --> 35:20.859
confusion disorder-- a mix of
rage with absurdity causes...

35:20.894 --> 35:24.263
Um, no, no...
It's actually funny.

35:24.297 --> 35:27.933
Anybody who knew Sean knew
that he never wanted kids.

35:27.968 --> 35:29.568
He had pictures of all the kids
he fathered.

35:29.602 --> 35:30.703
They were like trophies.
I mean,

35:30.737 --> 35:31.971
they made him feel like a man.

35:32.005 --> 35:33.372
But he would die

35:33.406 --> 35:35.140
before he'd wipe

35:35.175 --> 35:36.942
a little kid's ass.

35:36.977 --> 35:41.213
There is no way he would stick
with her if she got pregnant.

35:47.420 --> 35:49.688
We've catalogued every injury,
both peri- and postmortem.

35:49.723 --> 35:51.357
Booth and Sweets are convinced

35:51.391 --> 35:55.728
the last viable suspect is
the manager of the sperm bank.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.629
It's our job to help them.

35:57.664 --> 35:59.565
Or go blind in the process.

35:59.599 --> 36:01.934
Even blind,
you can still feel the bones.

36:01.968 --> 36:03.235
There appears

36:03.269 --> 36:04.670
to be discoloration

36:04.704 --> 36:06.805
in the left infraorbital margin.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.640
Staining from the slug slime?

36:08.675 --> 36:10.938
I'm sorry. I thought
I'd gotten everything off.

36:10.939 --> 36:13.883
No.
This is embedded in the bone.

36:16.649 --> 36:18.984
Wendell's busy with Brennan,

36:19.019 --> 36:21.653
but, uh, I can stay.
No. No, Angie.

36:21.688 --> 36:23.522
This is my thing.
Yeah.

36:23.556 --> 36:26.592
My love for you is stronger
than my gag reflex.

36:26.626 --> 36:28.660
Really? Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.

36:28.695 --> 36:30.362
All right, now...

36:30.397 --> 36:31.563
is it moving?

36:31.598 --> 36:32.931
Yeah.
Okay.

36:32.966 --> 36:34.500
Yeah. Oh, God. I really wish

36:34.534 --> 36:36.435
I could just hang out in
the waiting room smoking cigars

36:36.469 --> 36:38.037
with the other dads.
All right, now, look,

36:38.071 --> 36:40.439
I have a petri dish
that's got soil in it, okay?

36:40.473 --> 36:42.007
I need you to grab that,

36:42.042 --> 36:44.443
and now I need you
to massage the knot.

36:44.477 --> 36:48.380
Oh, boy, you so owe me.

36:48.415 --> 36:51.483
Oh, ho, ho, ho,
ho, ho, ho... okay.

36:51.518 --> 36:54.286
Oh, it's happening!

36:56.756 --> 36:58.757
Oh, my God.
How did you see that?

36:58.792 --> 37:01.360
That's what I asked.
Exceptional eyesight.

37:01.394 --> 37:04.196
Whatever this is,
it's very small.

37:04.230 --> 37:05.697
It's coming!

37:05.732 --> 37:08.100
Here it comes!

37:08.134 --> 37:10.202
There's got to be something
in the rule book

37:10.236 --> 37:12.738
about playing host
to an insect.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.842
It's out!

37:16.876 --> 37:19.311
What is that?

37:22.582 --> 37:26.351
A fingernail-- whoever
attacked the victim

37:26.386 --> 37:28.620
scratched at his eyes
and left part of their nail.

37:28.655 --> 37:30.823
- We can get DNA.
<i>- We found a fingernail</i>

37:30.857 --> 37:33.125
embedded in Sean Nolan's
orbital socket.

37:33.159 --> 37:35.260
- So?
- So we're pretty sure that

37:35.295 --> 37:36.462
it's yours.
While you were fighting,

37:36.496 --> 37:37.996
you scratched at his eyes.

37:38.031 --> 37:39.765
A sliver of your fingernail

37:39.799 --> 37:41.667
broke off.
That places you at the scene

37:41.701 --> 37:43.669
when Sean was killed.
That's ridiculous.

37:43.703 --> 37:46.171
Why would I kill him?
We're having a baby together.

37:46.206 --> 37:48.073
But, you know, you actually
weren't. You were having it

37:48.108 --> 37:50.409
alone, Judith, because he didn't
want to have any kids.

37:50.443 --> 37:53.378
We have a court order to get
a DNA sample from you.

37:53.413 --> 37:55.781
It will be easy to match
the fingernail to you.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.316
He used you.

37:57.350 --> 37:58.851
You lost it.

37:58.885 --> 38:00.052
If you confess,
the prosecutor's office

38:00.086 --> 38:03.455
will be a lot
more understanding.

38:05.658 --> 38:08.327
He laughed.

38:08.361 --> 38:12.064
When I told him
I was pregnant...

38:12.098 --> 38:13.532
he laughed.

38:13.566 --> 38:15.567
I just couldn't
understand.

38:15.602 --> 38:18.604
How could he father
all of those children

38:18.638 --> 38:23.509
and then laugh in my face
when I was carrying his?

38:26.146 --> 38:28.981

38:57.377 --> 38:59.912
The <i>Journal of Entomology</i>
called.

38:59.946 --> 39:01.880
They want to do a story on me.

39:01.915 --> 39:04.316
They're coming tomorrow.
That's great, man.

39:04.350 --> 39:06.151
And I actually... I analyzed

39:06.186 --> 39:08.954
the tissue on my neck where
the bot fly was incubating.

39:08.988 --> 39:11.223
I think this might
actually help research

39:11.257 --> 39:13.392
with insect-borne illness.

39:13.426 --> 39:15.661
You okay, Angie?

39:15.695 --> 39:17.496
Yeah. Sorry, I'm...

39:17.530 --> 39:19.831
I'm just really glad that
I'm with a guy who's...

39:19.866 --> 39:22.201
crazy enough
to do something

39:22.235 --> 39:24.002
like this.

39:26.706 --> 39:28.440
Think we can
call him Jack?

39:28.474 --> 39:30.943
Well, the journal actually
asked me what his name was,

39:30.977 --> 39:33.445
and since we were all in on it,

39:33.479 --> 39:37.249
I named him Jefferson.
 Aw.

39:37.283 --> 39:40.252
I think
he looks like you.

39:44.357 --> 39:45.824
<i>Well, I appreciate</i>

39:45.858 --> 39:47.693
you coming.
Sure.

39:47.727 --> 39:50.095
But why did we have to meet
in such a dump?

39:50.129 --> 39:52.864
I mean, we've both been
on the best seller list.

39:52.899 --> 39:55.133
I actually like it here.

39:55.168 --> 39:56.969
You're really an odd one, Tempe.

39:57.003 --> 39:58.470
So...

39:58.504 --> 40:00.105
what's on the menu
that won't kill me?

40:00.139 --> 40:02.174
The apple cobbler is wonderful.

40:02.208 --> 40:05.043
They use organic apples
and they season it...

40:05.078 --> 40:06.812
Okay, okay. Cobbler.

40:06.846 --> 40:08.981
Can I get you both something?

40:09.015 --> 40:11.917
Um, I'll have your famous
cobbler, I guess, and coffee.

40:11.951 --> 40:13.785
Me, too. But tea.

40:13.820 --> 40:14.920
Wait...

40:14.954 --> 40:15.988
are you...?

40:16.022 --> 40:17.856
Yes, I am.

40:17.890 --> 40:20.826
I love your books so much.

40:20.860 --> 40:22.683
I'm in a book club--
we all love 'em.

40:22.708 --> 40:23.895
Thank you.

40:23.896 --> 40:25.731
I'll be right back
with your cobbler.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.935
That's Tess Brown.
She wrote all those mysteries.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.770
Take my order.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.538
I've got to show
my book club.

40:33.573 --> 40:35.540
I know what
you've been doing, Tess.

40:35.575 --> 40:37.676
You haven't written
a best seller in four years.

40:37.710 --> 40:40.312
You've been goading me
so that we'd have a public feud

40:40.346 --> 40:42.314
to fuel the sales of your book.

40:42.348 --> 40:43.849
You're welcome.

40:43.883 --> 40:45.584
Excuse me?

40:45.618 --> 40:46.852
It's good for both of us.

40:46.886 --> 40:47.919
You're getting an early release

40:47.954 --> 40:49.087
and my sales are up.

40:49.122 --> 40:50.856
God bless America.

40:50.890 --> 40:54.960
It's deceitful, dishonest
and distasteful.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.562
Listen, I'm not like you, Tempe.

40:57.597 --> 41:00.365
You're smart, you're a good
writer, you've got that whole...

41:00.400 --> 41:02.301
crime-fighting thing.

41:02.335 --> 41:04.870
I'm a hack. And that's putting
a good spin on it.

41:04.904 --> 41:07.506
Lucky for me, the people
who buy my books are idiots.

41:07.540 --> 41:09.041
The people
who buy your books

41:09.075 --> 41:11.109
only want to be entertained.

41:11.144 --> 41:13.478
They'd be entertained
by a ball of string.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.614
I want no part of this.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.251
What are you doing...?

41:19.285 --> 41:21.119
What are you doing?

41:21.154 --> 41:22.954
No, you can't film me.
Give me that. No...

41:22.989 --> 41:25.424
You think I'm an idiot
and all my friends are idiots?

41:25.458 --> 41:27.659
She called
them idiots?

41:27.694 --> 41:28.960
Oh, that's bad.
It already has

41:28.995 --> 41:30.562
over half a million hits.

41:30.596 --> 41:32.798
My editor said
that Tess's publisher

41:32.832 --> 41:34.393
is dropping her.
You didn't set this up?

41:34.400 --> 41:36.902
No.
Whew! Talk about instant karma.

41:36.936 --> 41:38.640
Your book sales are gonna go
through the roof.

41:38.641 --> 41:41.844
I think the case we just solved might
make a good subject for my next book.

41:42.208 --> 41:44.109
No, no. You don't want
to relive that. No, that's bad.

41:44.143 --> 41:45.911
How about this? How about
we steal the space shuttle

41:45.945 --> 41:47.612
and solve a crime in space?

41:47.647 --> 41:49.448
The shuttle has been taken out
of service.

41:49.482 --> 41:51.402
It's fiction, okay?
Just work with me, all right?

41:51.417 --> 41:53.919
We can fight aliens. Like that
thing that came out of Hodgins'

41:53.953 --> 41:54.920
neck and grew huge.

41:54.954 --> 41:56.922
My books are fact-based, Booth.

41:56.956 --> 41:59.624
Kathy Reichs' sidekick needs
to be more important.

41:59.659 --> 42:01.827
Agent Andy is very important
to my plots.

42:01.861 --> 42:03.628
Yeah, and him fighting aliens...

42:03.663 --> 42:05.330
would make your book sales huge.

42:05.365 --> 42:08.066
Are you saying that you could
battle a space alien?

42:08.101 --> 42:09.568
Yeah, given the right
circumstances.

42:09.602 --> 42:12.037
Uh, but I would need a laser.
This is ridiculous.

42:12.071 --> 42:15.435
Okay. This is not ridiculous,
all right?

42:15.606 --> 42:18.108
When that alien attacks you,
you'll be happy I had a laser.

42:18.142 --> 42:19.843
Okay, I'm not listening.
