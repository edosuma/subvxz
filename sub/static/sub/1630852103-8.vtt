09:27.024 --> 09:31.320
I read a lot of pregnancy books,
but that wasn't in any of them.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.697
Cheers. Cheers, guys.

09:32.780 --> 09:33.906
[Davina] So cute.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.118
-[Christine] When did you get here?
-[Maya] Yesterday afternoon.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.203
Heather and Tarek's boat party
was yesterday.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.997
How was that?

09:41.080 --> 09:42.498
It was really good, you know.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.125
We had a nice boat.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.460
Jason brought up the fact
that you're coming back.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.712
Oh, good.

09:47.795 --> 09:52.425
The girls, you know…
I think you should talk to them.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.385
-[Christine slurping]
-Um…

09:54.468 --> 09:55.595
They weren't…

09:56.262 --> 09:58.264
[sighs] That was really good, thank you.

09:58.347 --> 10:01.642
-[laughs] They weren't too supportive.
-[Christine] What did they have to say?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.811
Well, Chrishell was obviously not a fan.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.187
-So…
-Of course.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.983
She just says, you know, like,
we need the positive energy at the office,

10:09.066 --> 10:10.359
so that was her.

10:10.443 --> 10:14.697
Then Emma was saying that someone
just messaged her about her ex,

10:14.780 --> 10:18.409
with, like, some fake account
in a DM on social media.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.828
-She thinks it's you.
-This is recently, she said?

10:20.911 --> 10:22.371
[Maya] It was at the boat party.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.499
She showed some messages.
She said this happens all the time.

10:25.583 --> 10:29.337
No! That is not me!
Like, I don't have time for that shit.

10:29.420 --> 10:33.674
If that bitch thinks
I'm sending her messages, that's crazy.

10:33.758 --> 10:38.638
I have no time or energy
for any of this drama.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.766
I think that these girls are so obsessed

10:41.849 --> 10:44.769
with an old version of me
that no longer exists,

10:44.852 --> 10:48.105
which really says more about them
than it does about me.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.567
The way that, you know,
her and I left it from the dog party,

10:51.651 --> 10:52.902
everything was good.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.613
I don't think so, Christine.
I think you guys need to talk.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.115
She was like,
"Christine was not honest with me."

10:58.199 --> 11:01.702
"Some of the stuff
that she told me were not true."

11:01.786 --> 11:04.580
Everything that I told her
was 100% accurate.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.749
-You know, my engagement--
-Which engagement?

11:08.709 --> 11:10.002
-With your ex?
-Yeah.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.712
I didn't know you were engaged.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.757
I wasn't telling people
because I never even wore the ring.

11:15.341 --> 11:19.679
Christine is saying that
she didn't tell anyone she was engaged.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.765
But then she told Mary she told Davina,

11:22.848 --> 11:24.475
so Davina knew she was engaged.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.811
So I'm just a little bit confused.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.396
Did he propose to you officially,

11:28.479 --> 11:30.606
or say, "Hey, I love you,
let's get married"?

11:30.690 --> 11:33.567
In his house, he got down
on his knee. A whole thing.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.569
-He got down on his knee? Wow.
-Yeah.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.488
Do I believe Christine was engaged?

11:37.571 --> 11:38.948
She's never lied to me before,

11:39.031 --> 11:40.282
and I trust her,

11:40.366 --> 11:43.285
but I'm a bit jarred
that Christine didn't mention it.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.497
I don't know what to think.
I really don't know what to think.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.542
When did he propose to you,
and when did you break up?

11:49.625 --> 11:52.336
-He proposed right before we broke up.
-Oh, really?

11:52.420 --> 11:54.797
-Then you just broke up and that's it?
-Yeah.

11:54.880 --> 11:59.385
And then I found out that,
two months later, Emma got engaged.

11:59.468 --> 12:03.431
And I don't know
what her ring looks… I never saw it.

12:03.514 --> 12:09.186
Mine was a square,
long, rectangular emerald cut.

12:09.812 --> 12:13.441
I never saw her ring,
but I just heard that they were engaged,

12:13.524 --> 12:16.318
and I said, "How convenient."

12:16.819 --> 12:20.072
No, but the ring… It's funny.
So my friend, he's a jeweler.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.699
He called me, said, like,

12:21.782 --> 12:24.785
"Hey, this guy at your office,
he just got engaged."

12:24.869 --> 12:28.414
But he mentioned Emma's name,
so I know he made the ring for Emma.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.707
-Wow.
-[Maya] Yeah.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.919
I listened to all the points
from Mary and Emma,

12:34.003 --> 12:35.296
and they all make sense.

12:35.379 --> 12:39.884
So I don't believe
Christine was engaged either.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.344
You know,
beyond all this relationship drama,

12:42.428 --> 12:43.888
which is beyond irrelevant,

12:43.971 --> 12:47.892
I want Emma
to get to know me for me today.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.060
But when people are mad at each other,

12:50.144 --> 12:52.438
and there is still something
that needs to be…

12:52.521 --> 12:55.524
-[Davina] Worked out?
-Worked out with Mary and Emma.

12:55.608 --> 12:59.361
Like, not to bring shit up,
but, like, I almost fucking died.

12:59.445 --> 13:03.199
I don't give a fuck
about any of this stupid, petty drama.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.826
I was flatlining, my baby was flatlining.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.078
Like, this is real shit.
This is real life.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.038
Yeah.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.373

wanna bitch about, you know,

"You said this to me,
and you hurt my feelings,"

13:13.918 --> 13:16.170
honey, I don't got time for that shit.

13:16.253 --> 13:20.925
I have real life, I have real stuff to do.
I'm selling houses. I wanna make money.

I don't even remember
talking to you on the phone.

19:08.355 --> 19:11.066
I just know I called you first,
I was like, "I want Mary."

19:11.150 --> 19:12.526
I've never seen you like that.

19:12.609 --> 19:15.112
-You were just like… [gasping]
-Yeah.

19:16.446 --> 19:21.618
I didn't go to the attorney's office
on Monday thinking that was gonna happen.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.745
I just feel, like, numb.

19:23.829 --> 19:27.166
My attorney was reading everything.
I'm on the other side of the desk.

19:27.249 --> 19:31.420
I've never seen him so emotional,
and his eyes just, like, got teary-eyed.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.088
And I'm like, "What?"

19:33.839 --> 19:35.174
He's like… [mimics typing]

19:35.257 --> 19:38.719
And he prints off a piece of paper,
then he takes a highlighter, like…

19:38.802 --> 19:40.804
[mimics highlighter]

19:40.888 --> 19:43.140
He turns it around,
slides it across the desk,

19:43.223 --> 19:44.725
and he goes, "Read that."

19:45.559 --> 19:46.560
Where's my phone?

19:46.643 --> 19:48.520
I took a screenshot of it. It says…

19:48.604 --> 19:52.774
Um, "Pursuant to penalty code 7827,

19:52.858 --> 19:55.444

20:23.555 --> 20:26.600
He gave them up.
He just gave his kids away two years ago.

fighting to get them in therapy.

but my body's broken down," whatever?

20:42.241 --> 20:43.075
Anything.

20:43.158 --> 20:48.038
If I would have known
this paper was filed on November 2019…

20:48.121 --> 20:50.624
I could have known
about this news two years ago.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.335
It just makes me want…
It just makes me sick.

20:53.418 --> 20:59.049
If everything that he said in that novel
of a "poor me" story was true,

20:59.132 --> 21:01.176
which it's fucking not because we know.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.887
-You saw him months before.
-Yeah, I know.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.973
Like, he was taking Noah to gymnastics.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.849
The kids told me he was training.

21:07.933 --> 21:11.186
He made it sound
as if he were like a vegetable.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.022
"My body, from football, and…"
What about your kids?

21:14.106 --> 21:16.692
What about your kids' hearts
from this? What about…

21:16.775 --> 21:18.527
He has trauma now,

21:18.610 --> 21:20.821
and in his letter, he's like…

21:20.904 --> 21:22.489
Because he can't work, and he can't this.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.534
He blew through all his money.
Wasn't because of child support!

21:25.617 --> 21:27.869
I don't know
what the fuck he did with the money.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.121
-I didn't see it.
-Yeah.

21:29.204 --> 21:30.580
For a year, I did.

21:30.664 --> 21:34.418
"I didn't have a place to live."
And, you know, "My car got repossessed."

21:34.501 --> 21:35.752
"I don't have a car now."

21:35.836 --> 21:38.630
I still don't have a car
because I'm so behind,

21:38.714 --> 21:41.758
and just starting to pay back
all this shit that I've paid for.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.177
I slept on the couch
for fucking a year and a half,

21:44.261 --> 21:46.680
'cause when he left,
I gave the kids their own room.

21:46.763 --> 21:49.141
I just don't fucking get it.
I don't get it.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.685
It was 280 pages of…

21:53.478 --> 21:56.023
honestly, like, bullshit.

21:56.106 --> 22:00.736
I believe that he has been affected
because of his NFL career and post,

22:00.819 --> 22:02.195
but I just don't believe

22:02.279 --> 22:05.615
it's to the extent
that he described in his letter.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.701
It's fucked up. Ugh.

22:07.784 --> 22:10.495
I'm angry and I'm sad and I'm confused,

22:10.579 --> 22:11.830

22:14.833 --> 22:18.337
I mean, how does the court not notify you?

22:18.920 --> 22:22.466
Basically, he didn't have an attorney.
He was representing himself.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.634
The court doesn't send out those letters.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.304

Their little brains aren't gonna know
how much hope they're holding onto

22:40.484 --> 22:43.945
until they hear that, like,
Daddy's not coming back.

"What's the difference
between a boomerang and Dad?"

22:56.166 --> 22:57.751
A boomerang comes back.

Somebody else might hear that
and think, like, "Oh."

"At least he's got a sense of humor
and he can…" It's a survival mechanism.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.258
Yeah.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.053
Everything my whole life
has been deflected with a joke

because everything that's happened
has been too hard to actually accept.

23:13.183 --> 23:16.436

my kid doing that, it just, like…

23:17.396 --> 23:19.147
It's… I'm like, "Fuck."

when something happens to my kids,

You're gonna get through this.

I have to stay as strong as I can
because they don't have any other parent.

It's me. It's been just me for two years,

23:44.381 --> 23:46.466
but now it's like, "Oh, fuck," like…

This is just all on me. [breath catches]

I don't get to have a breakdown
and just go, "Here," hand them over.

the fact that he would just…

for her to have me come into the office,

26:54.946 --> 26:56.823
so instead of just acting normal,

and she had been sending me DMs for years.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.470
It's like maybe
when someone does something wrong

28:42.554 --> 28:43.847
and they don't know how to…

28:43.930 --> 28:44.973
[Mary] Get out of it?

28:45.056 --> 28:46.433
-So--
-They gotta go with it.

28:46.516 --> 28:50.061
I feel that sometimes, people are like,
"I don't know how to get out,"

28:50.145 --> 28:52.689
so maybe they're
just making everything worse.

28:52.772 --> 28:55.233
-[Mary] Way worse. Digging a grave.
-I think so.

28:55.316 --> 28:58.069
I don't know how to feel about this.
It just makes me sad.

28:58.153 --> 29:02.615
There's a point where we're not
gonna continue to entertain something

29:02.699 --> 29:05.160
that we all know isn't true.

29:05.243 --> 29:08.788
I didn't have this information before,
so it's shocking to me.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.833
But she said you did,
so, you know, another lie.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.003
The emotional part of me
wants to believe her,

29:15.086 --> 29:19.507
but the rational, logical mind, it just…

29:19.591 --> 29:21.050
The facts are not adding up.

29:21.134 --> 29:24.888
[Vanessa] I think that Christine right now
is in a self-destructive cycle.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.932
At some point, like,
we have to know, as adults,

29:28.016 --> 29:29.642
what's right and what's wrong,

29:29.726 --> 29:31.770
because we are grown women,

29:31.853 --> 29:35.148
and I do not tolerate behavior like this.

29:35.231 --> 29:36.775
She's going down.
