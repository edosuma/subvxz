- Why?!
- Her hair is not that pretty.

00:16.791 --> 00:18.492
- Why?
- It's not.

00:21.762 --> 00:25.632
Really? You wanna hit that?

00:25.665 --> 00:27.868
That cheesy little cunt?

00:29.269 --> 00:30.971
Not my type.

00:31.005 --> 00:32.372
Why?

00:34.008 --> 00:38.278
What's that?
What are you saying?

00:38.312 --> 00:40.480
No!

00:40.514 --> 00:42.749
You want your mommy?

00:44.184 --> 00:46.620
Your mom is fucking dead.

- Morning, Megan.
- Hi, how are you?

02:35.029 --> 02:36.730
- Fine, thanks. How 'bout you?
- Good.

02:44.504 --> 02:45.639
Sir.

02:47.207 --> 02:49.209
Sir, I understand that.

02:50.410 --> 02:53.513
Okay. Okay, but yelling is not
gonna make it any better.

02:57.817 --> 02:59.619
Okay.

02:59.653 --> 03:01.421
Okay, you do that.

03:02.322 --> 03:03.958
Okay. Bye-bye.

03:09.196 --> 03:11.198
- Hey, Megan.
- Good morning.

03:11.231 --> 03:13.167
Can you come into my office
real quick?

03:13.200 --> 03:14.868
Yeah, sure. Is everything okay?

03:14.901 --> 03:16.636
Yeah, just come on down.

03:16.670 --> 03:17.704
Okay.

03:23.343 --> 03:26.213
We're gonna...
I'm gonna have to let you go.

03:28.148 --> 03:30.184
I mean, business hasn't...

03:31.952 --> 03:33.620
Why? Did I do something wrong?

03:33.653 --> 03:35.755
No, you didn't
do anything wrong.

03:35.789 --> 03:38.025
We-I just gotta
make some cut-backs.

03:38.058 --> 03:40.827
I think it's best
if you go today.

03:40.860 --> 03:43.597
- Wait, I don't...
- Take the rest of the day and...

03:43.630 --> 03:45.332
you know, relax.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.260
I mean, you're a bright girl,

03:47.285 --> 03:50.604
and I promise I'll give you
some good references.

03:50.637 --> 03:53.273
- You do a great job, I just...
- I have bills I have to pay.

03:53.307 --> 03:55.509
- Are you serious?
- I'm sorry.

04:00.047 --> 04:02.416
I mean, you're-you're wonderful.
Don't worry about it.

04:02.449 --> 04:03.817
You'll be fine.

04:07.287 --> 04:09.089
Hey babe, it's me.

04:09.123 --> 04:12.026
I know you are probably
busy with work right now.

04:12.059 --> 04:15.595
I just really wanted
to talk to you.

04:15.629 --> 04:20.000
I just got fired
from my job, again...

04:21.235 --> 04:22.702
of course.

04:23.537 --> 04:25.305
Just

04:25.339 --> 04:27.007
call me back
whenever you get this

04:27.041 --> 04:28.408
or-or just come on over.

04:28.442 --> 04:31.278
I know you said you were
going to come over later so...

04:31.311 --> 04:32.879
But either way
I'll see you later.

04:32.912 --> 04:35.249
I love you. Bye.

04:40.654 --> 04:42.022
Babe?

04:48.595 --> 04:50.564
- Yes.
- Harder! Harder!

04:56.570 --> 04:57.737
Yeah.

05:07.247 --> 05:08.915
Oh, fuck! Shit! Fuck!

05:08.948 --> 05:10.917
Megan! Fuck! Megan!

05:10.950 --> 05:12.152
Damn it.

05:13.019 --> 05:14.754
Fuck. Okay, okay.

05:14.788 --> 05:16.323
What the fuck? Are you serious?!

05:16.356 --> 05:17.991
Okay, Megan. Calm the fuck down.

05:18.024 --> 05:19.559
Oh, my God!

05:22.962 --> 05:23.963
Listen.

05:25.099 --> 05:28.602
I honestly don't know how
you didn't see this coming.

05:28.635 --> 05:31.338
I mean, after everything
that we've been through,

05:31.371 --> 05:33.773
it just started adding up.

05:33.807 --> 05:34.874
You should've known.

05:34.908 --> 05:37.677
Josh, I did not see this coming.

05:37.711 --> 05:39.713
You're fucking my roommate?

05:39.746 --> 05:41.581
How long has this been going on?

05:42.616 --> 05:45.819
So... are you gonna finish here?

05:45.852 --> 05:47.412
- 'Cause I'm not finished.
- Oh, my G...

05:47.437 --> 05:50.924
- Fuck you, you fucking slut!
- Megan! Megan.

05:50.957 --> 05:52.477
Megan, chill out.
Seriously, it's okay.

05:52.502 --> 05:53.727
Chill out?!

05:53.760 --> 05:57.364
You're fucking my boyfriend and
you're telling me to chill out?!

05:57.397 --> 05:58.798
Here's the thing, sweetheart.

05:58.832 --> 06:02.001
You're not one, but you're
two months late in rent.

06:02.035 --> 06:05.071
Consider me fucking Josh just like
a sweet little eviction notice.

06:05.105 --> 06:08.041
Should probably get one of maybe
six things that you have here

06:08.074 --> 06:10.710
and get the fuck
out of my house.

06:10.744 --> 06:12.179
You're house?

06:12.212 --> 06:13.652
You mean the one
your daddy pays for,

06:13.680 --> 06:15.720
- just like your credit cards, your cars...
- Megan.

06:15.753 --> 06:18.022
- No. And everything else?
- No, it's okay, let her go.

06:18.055 --> 06:20.654
Is this because
you don't have a dad?

06:20.687 --> 06:21.888
All right.

06:23.890 --> 06:26.826
Megan... just go.

06:27.861 --> 06:28.862
That's it?

06:29.629 --> 06:32.799
I'm gonna let you handle
this situation.

06:36.069 --> 06:37.304
That's it?

06:38.638 --> 06:39.739
Just go?

06:40.840 --> 06:43.977
I honestly don't see
any other option right now.

06:52.352 --> 06:53.487
Megan.

06:54.020 --> 06:55.155
What?

06:56.122 --> 06:59.159
Just... take the money,

06:59.193 --> 07:01.261
and go to a hotel,

07:01.295 --> 07:04.731
or just anywhere else
besides here.

07:16.843 --> 07:18.278
Bye, Megan.

08:19.406 --> 08:20.607
Hey.

08:22.809 --> 08:24.143
Oh, nothing.

08:25.144 --> 08:27.046
You'll never believe
where I am right now.

08:29.316 --> 08:32.452
In a shit-bag motel
in the middle of nowhere.

08:35.255 --> 08:36.623
Oh, no.

08:36.655 --> 08:39.426
No, I can't wait to tell you
all about this.

08:39.458 --> 08:41.027
So...

08:41.059 --> 08:43.697
I come home from work earlier...

08:43.730 --> 08:45.131
only to find...

08:46.165 --> 08:48.268
Josh, my boyfriend
that I told you about.

08:50.937 --> 08:52.005
He was...

08:53.940 --> 08:55.375
He was fucking my roommate.

08:58.478 --> 09:00.480
Amanda, are you sure
it's okay that I come?

09:03.283 --> 09:05.352
I just... I don't wanna
be a burden, you know?

09:08.888 --> 09:10.824
Okay.

09:10.857 --> 09:12.025
Well, hey...

09:12.859 --> 09:15.261
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

09:15.295 --> 09:16.863
I just want this day to be over.

09:17.797 --> 09:20.033
I'll probably wake up around...

09:20.066 --> 09:23.670
maybe four or five
and head your way.

09:23.703 --> 09:25.939
Yeah, I'll probably
get there around noon,

09:25.972 --> 09:27.407
like one o'clock?

09:28.875 --> 09:30.009
All right.

09:30.910 --> 09:32.479
All right, well,
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.649
All right. Bye.

10:19.993 --> 10:21.094
Boo!

10:24.831 --> 10:27.634
Holy shit, I missed your face!

10:27.667 --> 10:29.369
Say hi to SnapChat!

10:29.403 --> 10:31.805
Oh, my God, stop.
I look like shit.

10:32.906 --> 10:34.508
How are you?

10:34.541 --> 10:37.110
We have so much to catch up on!

10:38.378 --> 10:39.513
Put your bag down.

10:39.546 --> 10:40.746
I see you have win over there.

10:40.771 --> 10:42.682
I do. You're gonna need it.

10:42.716 --> 10:44.083
Welcome to Georgia.

10:44.117 --> 10:45.719
It can't be any worse
than Louisiana.

10:45.752 --> 10:48.522
I tried to call you earlier.
I got turned around in some shit-hole.

10:48.555 --> 10:51.725
I know, I'm sorry.
I was at the gun range.

10:51.758 --> 10:53.727
- You were at the gun range?
- Yeah.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.629
Yeah, we do have a lot
to catch up on.

10:55.662 --> 10:56.863
We do.

10:56.896 --> 10:59.365
I think Bobby just wants me
to be able to protect myself,

10:59.399 --> 11:02.168
but I think he's just
into Charlie's Angels.

11:02.201 --> 11:03.970
- Okay, well, who's not?
- Yeah.

11:05.004 --> 11:06.973
Holy shit! You live here!

11:07.006 --> 11:08.542
Yeah, Bobby does pretty well.

11:08.575 --> 11:10.055
Wait 'til I show you the lake,
though.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.946
We're gonna be
working on our tans.

11:12.979 --> 11:14.147
So, wait, where is he now?

11:14.180 --> 11:16.115
He's at work, as always.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.418
What does he do?
You never told me.

11:18.452 --> 11:20.654
He's a GM of a club.

11:21.755 --> 11:26.059
- What kind of club?
- A tits and ass club, okay?

11:26.092 --> 11:27.961
- Yeah.
- How do you feel about that?

11:27.994 --> 11:31.631
I mean, we live here.
I can't complain about that.

11:31.665 --> 11:32.865
Yeah, he must be gettin' paid.

11:32.890 --> 11:33.957
Yeah.

11:37.103 --> 11:39.639
- What is with his hair?
- You don't like it?

11:39.673 --> 11:41.975
- No. Why do you...
- I think it's sexy.

11:42.008 --> 11:43.777
Oh, Lord.

11:43.810 --> 11:45.570
Did you see what I tagged
you in, by the way?

11:45.595 --> 11:47.113
No, I don't...
What? On Facebook?

11:47.146 --> 11:49.106
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no, I don't have Facebook anymore.

11:49.131 --> 11:51.017
Dude, I tag you in shit
for a reason.

11:51.050 --> 11:52.719
- Yeah, it's annoying.
- It was so funny.

11:52.752 --> 11:54.432
- That's why I deleted it.
- You missed it.

11:54.457 --> 11:57.794
Babe! Where's your fine ass?

12:00.059 --> 12:01.795
I'm ready for that blow job!

12:02.829 --> 12:04.731
Look who's here!

12:05.965 --> 12:08.201
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

12:09.636 --> 12:10.870
What's goin' on here?

12:10.904 --> 12:14.273
Just drinking,
a little girl talk.

12:14.307 --> 12:16.242
You like
when I talk dirty to you?

12:16.275 --> 12:17.376
Oh, no.

12:17.410 --> 12:19.278
In front of our guests, babe?
Really?

12:19.312 --> 12:21.014
It's... You know what?
It's actually fine.

12:21.047 --> 12:22.181
I think it's kinda hot.

12:22.215 --> 12:24.951
- Don't encourage him, Megan.
- See?

12:24.984 --> 12:27.186
So, you must be Bobby.

12:27.887 --> 12:30.056
I've heard all the stories.

12:30.089 --> 12:33.326
- The bad ones.
- Good and bad. You know.

12:33.359 --> 12:35.261
- You still came?
- Yeah.

12:35.294 --> 12:36.930
Brave girl.

12:36.963 --> 12:38.364
Very brave.

12:40.133 --> 12:41.893
You didn't tell me
she was so pretty, though.

12:41.918 --> 12:43.970
- Stop.
- Hey, don't get any ideas.

12:44.003 --> 12:45.438
I've already got 'em.

12:46.472 --> 12:48.675
What is this?

12:48.708 --> 12:50.409
- What is this?
- Wine, babe.

12:50.443 --> 12:51.845
- Wine? No.
- Yeah.

12:51.878 --> 12:54.213
Gimme that. Gimme that.

12:54.247 --> 12:55.715
Wine...

12:55.749 --> 12:56.916
We're doing shots.

12:58.117 --> 13:00.219
- Is he serious?
- Oh, shit. He is so serious.

13:00.253 --> 13:01.655
I can't do shots.

13:01.688 --> 13:05.391
- Get ready for this.
- No. I can't do it.

13:05.424 --> 13:07.827
Are you ready for some vodka?

13:07.861 --> 13:09.796
Good luck.
Megan doesn't usually do that.

13:09.829 --> 13:12.065
You know what?
You make mine a double.

13:12.999 --> 13:14.467
Okay.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.870
Ao, wait, when did
Little Miss Boone's Farm

13:16.903 --> 13:18.404
become a vodka shot hooker?

13:18.437 --> 13:21.474
Tonight. You are witnessing
the transition.

13:21.507 --> 13:23.476
I like this girl more and more.

13:23.509 --> 13:25.579
What are we cheersing to, babe?

13:25.612 --> 13:27.413
To makin' money...

13:27.446 --> 13:28.848
and gettin' laid.

13:28.882 --> 13:30.516
- Of course.
- I need both.

13:30.550 --> 13:31.751
Shit.

13:35.188 --> 13:37.290
- I hate vodka.
- That burns.

13:37.323 --> 13:39.158
Yes.

13:39.192 --> 13:40.159
So, what now?

13:40.193 --> 13:44.664
I say movie. Maybe snuggle?

13:44.698 --> 13:45.899
No.

13:45.932 --> 13:47.372
I know what kind of movies
you watch.

13:48.802 --> 13:50.403
You're probably just like her.

13:50.436 --> 13:52.476
You guys watch those shitty
independent horror films

13:52.501 --> 13:55.474
with all the titties,
and the blood, and the sex.

13:55.508 --> 13:56.542
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:56.576 --> 13:58.912
- What's wrong with that?
- Exactly.

13:58.945 --> 14:00.479
Not my cup of tea.

14:00.513 --> 14:01.781
Sorry, guys.

14:01.815 --> 14:03.016
Fine.

14:03.049 --> 14:04.529
Actually, I think I'm gonna
go to bed.

14:04.554 --> 14:06.586
It's been a really...

14:06.620 --> 14:08.855
long, shitty two days.

14:08.888 --> 14:12.859
Which which wing
of the house am I in, again?

14:12.892 --> 14:14.160
I don't remember.

14:14.193 --> 14:18.031
That's right.
You are in the southeast wing.

14:18.064 --> 14:20.199
- Southeast wing. Okay.
- Yeah.

14:20.233 --> 14:21.968
If you want, can get you a map.

14:22.969 --> 14:24.437
Hey, Bobby?

14:24.470 --> 14:25.739
Yes?

14:25.772 --> 14:27.306
Can you try
not to keep me up tonight?

14:27.340 --> 14:28.842
I know how loud
this one can get.

14:28.875 --> 14:31.410
Go to bed, drunk-ass.

14:32.422 --> 14:33.822
I think she wants us
to keep her up.

14:33.847 --> 14:35.481
You think so?

14:36.616 --> 14:38.652
Maybe after some more shots.

14:41.988 --> 14:44.357
Oh, my God. We are not
drinking that much ever again.

14:44.390 --> 14:45.959
I feel like shit.

14:45.992 --> 14:47.761
- But it was fun.
- Yeah.

14:47.794 --> 14:49.629
Good morning, lovebirds.

14:49.663 --> 14:50.830
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:50.864 --> 14:52.165
How do you feel this morning?

14:52.198 --> 14:53.900
I feel fantastic, actually.

14:53.933 --> 14:55.543
- You look good. Where are you off to?
- Thank you.

14:55.568 --> 14:57.003
I'm gonna go look for a job.

14:57.036 --> 14:58.276
Why not hit the ground running?

14:58.301 --> 14:59.673
Yeah, good for you.

14:59.706 --> 15:02.475
Babe, I told you to tell her
I have a job for her.

15:02.508 --> 15:05.912
And I fuckin' told you she's
not working in a shit-hole.

15:05.945 --> 15:07.513
- Really? Shit-hole?
- Yeah.

15:07.546 --> 15:09.315
Remember, this shit-hole
is the reason

15:09.348 --> 15:11.228
you can swipe your goddamn
debit card every day,

15:11.253 --> 15:12.618
goin' to get your manis
and pedis

15:12.652 --> 15:13.732
and whatever the fuck else.

15:13.757 --> 15:15.588
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

15:15.621 --> 15:18.181
Do you wanna tell her about the
girl you're sending dick pics to?

15:18.214 --> 15:19.494
Let's talk about that one,
Bobby.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.528
That was a year ago after two dates.
What the fuck?

15:22.561 --> 15:23.930
I don't fucking care.

15:23.963 --> 15:26.032
You guys can go ahead
and talk about that.

15:26.065 --> 15:28.101
I'm desperate, honestly.

15:28.134 --> 15:29.836
I have a job for you.

15:31.504 --> 15:32.706
No, Megan.

15:32.739 --> 15:35.675
Bobby, I fuckin' told you,
we're not talking about this.

15:35.709 --> 15:36.843
I told you already.

15:36.876 --> 15:38.678
- Where are you going?
- To take a shower.

15:38.712 --> 15:41.781
Don't worry, I don't need
your debit card today.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.683
Well then, eat a goddamn bagel.

15:43.717 --> 15:45.518
You can choke
on your fucking bagel.

15:47.954 --> 15:50.023
I will finish her bagel.

15:50.957 --> 15:52.425
So...

15:52.458 --> 15:53.927
Amanda told me...

15:53.960 --> 15:56.629
that you work at a strip club.

15:56.662 --> 15:59.498
Okay, yes. So, here's the deal.

15:59.532 --> 16:01.500
- I'm not asking you to strip.
- Okay.

16:01.534 --> 16:04.103
We had a cocktail waitress
bolt on us a couple days ago,

16:04.137 --> 16:08.341
and I figured
since you bartender...

16:08.374 --> 16:10.543
you can make some extra dough
slingin' some drinks.

16:10.576 --> 16:12.245
At least until you
find something better.

16:12.278 --> 16:13.747
Okay, s...

16:13.780 --> 16:16.115
I'm not gonna have to be naked
or anything, though, right?

16:16.149 --> 16:20.954
No, no, no, no, no.
Fully clothed... unfortunately.

16:24.223 --> 16:27.093
I mean, I do really
need a job right now.

16:27.126 --> 16:28.127
Desperately.

16:28.728 --> 16:30.363
Look. I tell you what.

16:30.396 --> 16:33.432
Come with me tonight,
meet John, he's my partner,

16:33.466 --> 16:34.934
and we'll go from there.

16:35.802 --> 16:37.603
Shit, okay.

16:37.636 --> 16:39.072
I'm serious, though.

16:39.105 --> 16:42.708
I'm not taking my clothes off.
It's not happening.

16:42.742 --> 16:44.022
- No, I get it. I get it.
- Okay.

16:44.047 --> 16:46.683
Trust me, okay? Trust me.

16:48.247 --> 16:50.016
But...

16:50.649 --> 16:52.618
this... doesn't work.

16:52.651 --> 16:53.853
My clothes?

16:53.887 --> 16:56.655
It is a strip club.
You gotta dress sexy.

16:56.689 --> 16:58.524
- Okay.
- Here. Tell you what.

17:01.795 --> 17:03.096
Here.

17:04.262 --> 17:07.901
Take this, you and Amanda
go have, like, a girls' day,

17:07.934 --> 17:09.969
go shopping...

17:10.002 --> 17:11.170
I suggest tall boots.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.339
Bobby, no. This is way too much.

17:13.372 --> 17:14.339
I can't take this.

17:14.373 --> 17:17.410
It's fine. It's money.

17:17.443 --> 17:20.046
Somethin' to play with.
Have fun.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.949
And for God's sakes, bring
Amanda back in a good mood.

17:22.982 --> 17:25.483
- Okay, I can do that.
- Please.

17:25.518 --> 17:27.053
I can do that. Thank you.

17:36.996 --> 17:38.564
No, no, no, no, no.

17:38.597 --> 17:40.199
Where do you think you're going?

17:49.075 --> 17:50.609
What are you doing?

17:50.643 --> 17:53.813
Please! Why are you doing this?
What did I do?

17:53.847 --> 17:55.014
You know what you did,

17:55.048 --> 17:57.183
you scrawny little bitch.

17:57.216 --> 17:58.584
I didn't do anything!

17:58.617 --> 18:01.654
You come into my club
for two days,

18:01.687 --> 18:03.522
and you start
running your mouth,

18:03.556 --> 18:05.324
and talking shit about me?

18:05.358 --> 18:08.194
I am gonna teach you a lesson.

18:08.227 --> 18:09.495
I didn't do that!

18:09.528 --> 18:13.199
Please stop lying to us!

18:13.232 --> 18:16.769
Yeah, stop lying through
your pretty little teeth,

18:16.802 --> 18:19.638
or I'm gonna cut 'em outta
your pretty little face.

18:19.672 --> 18:21.074
What do we do now, guys?

18:21.107 --> 18:22.508
Watch.

18:24.343 --> 18:27.013
Good shot, Carmen!

18:27.046 --> 18:28.114
My turn.

18:32.919 --> 18:35.721
Are you guys really
gonna kill her?

18:35.754 --> 18:37.223
Let me see.

18:38.057 --> 18:39.558
Listen, new girl!

18:40.159 --> 18:42.061
You're either with us...

18:42.095 --> 18:43.729
or you're against us.

18:45.264 --> 18:47.400
Yeah, so let's find out...

18:51.837 --> 18:53.306
fresh meat...

18:54.107 --> 18:55.408
one of us?

18:57.010 --> 18:59.112
Now bash her fucking skull in.

19:09.188 --> 19:11.524
That was fuckin' awesome.

19:11.557 --> 19:13.259
Yeah, looks like you got her.

19:13.292 --> 19:14.727
Is she dead?

19:16.930 --> 19:19.065
Ding dong, the bitch is dead.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.535
Knife, please.

19:22.568 --> 19:23.569
Why?

19:24.670 --> 19:25.972
Because...

19:26.906 --> 19:29.008
this pretty little thing...

19:29.808 --> 19:32.711
has such cute teeth...

19:32.745 --> 19:34.880
you know she had a dentist...

19:34.914 --> 19:36.950
and they keep records
of that shit.

19:36.983 --> 19:39.252
Oh, yeah.

19:39.285 --> 19:42.888
What are you gonna do?
Cut her DNA out, too?

19:42.922 --> 19:44.958
You think you're
so fuckin' smart.

20:02.241 --> 20:04.010
She's twitchin'.

20:05.011 --> 20:06.379
We got a twitcher.

20:14.187 --> 20:16.889
Maybe you should hit her again.

20:16.922 --> 20:18.057
Can I?

20:20.559 --> 20:21.794
Naw.

20:23.029 --> 20:24.663
We'll just let her bleed out.

20:45.851 --> 20:47.720
I'm telling you,
I fucking hate this bitch

20:47.753 --> 20:49.388
with a burning passion.

20:49.422 --> 20:51.390
I mean, she already has
four fuckin' kids.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.558
We called that, though.

20:52.591 --> 20:54.151
We called that
in high school, remember?

20:54.176 --> 20:55.361
We did.

20:55.394 --> 20:57.563
So, I wanted to talk to you...

20:57.596 --> 20:58.597
about this job.

20:59.565 --> 21:01.767
Please don't take it
because you wanna...

21:01.800 --> 21:03.036
impress Bobby.

21:03.069 --> 21:05.204
I'm not tryin' to impress Bobby.

21:05.238 --> 21:06.205
It's not about that,

21:06.239 --> 21:08.307
I just-I really,
really need money right now.

21:08.341 --> 21:10.176
Like, I'm completely broke.

21:10.209 --> 21:12.278
I don't expect to live
in your house for free.

21:12.311 --> 21:15.614
Megan, what pisses me off
is that you know you can.

21:15.648 --> 21:17.550
Like, just get back up
on your feet.

21:17.583 --> 21:19.263
- That's all I'm saying.
- It's just a job.

21:19.288 --> 21:20.623
I mean, I...

21:21.054 --> 21:22.888
I'm a waitress at a strip club.

21:22.921 --> 21:24.657
It's not like
I'm actually stripping.

21:24.690 --> 21:26.325
This place is fucking strange.

21:26.359 --> 21:27.839
I don't even
want Bobby working there.

21:27.864 --> 21:29.799
Why the hell would I want you
working there?

21:29.833 --> 21:30.796
Tell you what.

21:31.530 --> 21:33.532
What if I just work one night?

21:33.566 --> 21:34.833
Okay.

21:34.867 --> 21:36.135
Don't say I told you so.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.969
Anyway, I'm gonna start
getting ready, though.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.381
You wanna fuckin' die?

21:48.414 --> 21:51.284
Go in that house.
Go in that fuckin'...

21:51.317 --> 21:52.885
Stupid bitch is gonna
go in the house.

21:52.918 --> 21:55.254
♪

21:56.589 --> 21:59.725
Fuck, she's... She gone.

21:59.758 --> 22:02.295
Stupid bitch went in the house.
She dead.

22:02.328 --> 22:03.929
Fuckin' stupid.

22:08.934 --> 22:10.769
How do I look?

22:10.803 --> 22:12.004
Hey!

22:12.037 --> 22:13.572
You're kinda making me
turn lesbian,

22:13.606 --> 22:14.607
I'm not gonna lie.

22:14.640 --> 22:15.808
- Good!
- Yeah.

22:15.841 --> 22:17.110
Hello.

22:17.143 --> 22:19.445
Damn! Damn is right.

22:21.647 --> 22:24.483
I think that, you know,
maybe we should just forget work

22:24.517 --> 22:26.919
and the three of us go upstairs.

22:26.952 --> 22:28.987
Oh, yeah? You'd like that, huh?

22:29.021 --> 22:31.290
- No.
- Just a thought.

22:31.324 --> 22:32.925
You're in the doghouse, babe.

22:33.859 --> 22:35.094
Anyway...

22:35.128 --> 22:37.263
You ready for your first night?

22:37.296 --> 22:38.697
Yeah.

22:38.731 --> 22:40.099
Kinda nervous, but let's do it.

22:42.101 --> 22:46.805
- Wish me luck.
- Don't be a whore.

22:46.839 --> 22:49.208
Babe, thanks for the kiss!

22:49.242 --> 22:50.209
Love you!

22:50.243 --> 22:51.777
Bye! Have fun!

22:52.778 --> 22:53.779
Bye.

22:59.118 --> 23:01.019
- Bobby, what's up?
- 'Sup, man?

23:01.053 --> 23:02.853
Hey, this is the girl
I was telling you about,

23:02.878 --> 23:04.880
Megan, for the cocktail job.

23:05.858 --> 23:07.178
It's very nice
to meet you, Megan.

23:07.203 --> 23:08.427
Hi. John, right?

23:08.461 --> 23:10.163
Yeah. With a J.

23:10.196 --> 23:12.465
Have a seat. All right?

23:13.766 --> 23:16.126
Hey, I'll bring her back out
when we get done talking, okay?

23:17.536 --> 23:20.839
I got it, okay?
Thank you, Bobby.

23:20.873 --> 23:22.208
Cool.

23:27.346 --> 23:29.282
So, Megan...

23:29.315 --> 23:30.916
Tell me why you wanna work here.

23:32.050 --> 23:34.553
Well, to be completely honest
with you,

23:34.587 --> 23:37.223
I... just really need a job.

23:38.324 --> 23:40.893
The last couple days
have just been... really...

23:40.926 --> 23:42.728
Yeah, Bobby told us.

23:43.462 --> 23:44.630
Told you what?

23:45.331 --> 23:46.665
Just about your rough patch.

23:47.533 --> 23:49.168
Look, everybody goes through it.

23:49.202 --> 23:51.404
Right? You know... So...

23:55.941 --> 23:57.276
Why don't you take this?

24:01.347 --> 24:02.515
There.

24:03.682 --> 24:05.584
What is this?

24:06.452 --> 24:07.620
Just an advance.

24:07.653 --> 24:11.190
Consider it... training money.

24:11.224 --> 24:13.384
You know, most of the girls
really don't make any money

24:13.409 --> 24:15.861
the first, like, couple of
shifts that they do, you know,

24:15.894 --> 24:17.630
not until they get the hang of it.
You know?

24:19.131 --> 24:21.234
Well, I-I can't take this,
though.

24:21.267 --> 24:23.035
I haven't done anything for it.

24:23.068 --> 24:26.205
Bobby said a lot of really good
things about you, all right?

24:26.239 --> 24:28.374
You seem like a good egg,

24:28.407 --> 24:29.908
and we need somebody.

24:30.609 --> 24:32.578
Last girl we had flaked out.

24:32.611 --> 24:34.213
Yeah, Bobby told me about that.

24:35.381 --> 24:36.415
So?

24:37.283 --> 24:38.251
What do you say?

24:38.284 --> 24:39.618
Wanna get started?

24:40.419 --> 24:41.587
You mean tonight?

24:42.588 --> 24:44.390
Why not? No better time
than the present.

24:44.423 --> 24:45.624
Right?

24:46.592 --> 24:49.061
Okay. Sure...

24:49.094 --> 24:50.996
Do I need to fill out
any paperwork, or...?

24:51.029 --> 24:53.366
No, no, no, no.
We don't mess with any of that bullshit.

24:53.399 --> 24:56.335
Well, here... Just do... Here.

24:56.369 --> 24:58.070
- Take this shirt.
- Okay.

24:58.871 --> 25:01.073
Head back to the dressing room.

25:01.106 --> 25:02.866
When you feel comfortable
and you're ready...

25:02.899 --> 25:04.109
come meet me out at the bar,
all right,

25:04.134 --> 25:06.078
and we'll start introducing you
to everybody,

25:06.111 --> 25:07.711
- and get your thing going. Okay?
- Okay.

25:07.736 --> 25:09.382
Awesome. Thank you.

25:09.415 --> 25:11.950
Yeah? My pleasure.

25:17.256 --> 25:18.424
Sarah!

25:20.259 --> 25:22.528
- Megan, this is Sarah.
- Hi.

25:22.561 --> 25:25.230
Sarah's our head bartender here,
all right?

25:25.264 --> 25:27.600
Megan is actually starting off
as a waitress tonight,

25:27.633 --> 25:29.201
so what I'm gonna need from you

25:29.234 --> 25:31.314
is to help her get inclimated
with things, all right?

25:31.347 --> 25:32.658
Can you do that for me?
Can you help me out?

25:32.683 --> 25:33.906
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, cool?

25:33.939 --> 25:35.508
Mind popping me a beer?

25:36.909 --> 25:38.611
She's the best one here.

25:38.644 --> 25:40.153
All right, so if you're
gonna learn anything,

50:53.757 --> 50:56.660
Is your daughter a squirter?

50:56.693 --> 51:00.497
Let's find out
if you're a squirter.

51:00.531 --> 51:02.867
Cut this motherfucker down.

51:16.013 --> 51:17.548
So, how did I do?

51:24.255 --> 51:26.090
He's dead.

51:26.123 --> 51:28.759
Looks like you pierced
his internal jugular.

51:34.731 --> 51:36.433
Let's get the fuck outta here.

51:44.375 --> 51:45.742
Hey!

51:45.776 --> 51:47.044
Hey.

51:47.078 --> 51:49.313
John wants to see you
in his office.

51:49.346 --> 51:50.347
For what?

51:50.915 --> 51:52.749
I think it's something to do
with your drawer.

51:52.783 --> 51:53.918
My drawer?

51:54.451 --> 51:55.586
Yeah.

51:56.553 --> 51:58.722
- Okay.
- After you.

52:06.898 --> 52:08.399
She's here.

52:13.204 --> 52:14.771
Where's John?

52:14.805 --> 52:16.473
John's not coming.

52:18.976 --> 52:21.545
You, missy,

52:21.578 --> 52:25.182
need to learn how to watch
your pretty little mouth.

52:25.216 --> 52:26.884
Or at least
have some common sense

52:26.918 --> 52:28.752
and check
beneath the bathroom stall

52:28.785 --> 52:31.055
before you start talkin' smack.

52:34.725 --> 52:36.127
I have an idea.

52:37.361 --> 52:38.963
Let's make her dance.

52:39.630 --> 52:41.098
What?

52:41.132 --> 52:43.400
Dance for us, dollface,

52:43.434 --> 52:46.737
or it's about to get
real painful for you.

52:49.573 --> 52:51.575
Dance, bitch!

52:55.980 --> 52:57.414
That's just awful.

52:58.449 --> 53:00.584
Yeah, it's not really
workin' for me, sweetie.

53:00.617 --> 53:03.220
You need to pick up the pace.

53:03.254 --> 53:05.622
I wouldn't throw her
a fucking dollar.

53:05.656 --> 53:08.092
I dunno.
I'd go for some popcorn.

53:08.125 --> 53:09.927
I'll give her a dollar.

53:09.961 --> 53:11.362
Take your shirt off.

53:12.429 --> 53:14.198
Why are you doing this?

53:18.702 --> 53:20.837
Yeah.

53:20.871 --> 53:24.608
I wouldn't quit your bartending
job if I were you.

53:26.877 --> 53:28.879
Bra, too.

53:28.912 --> 53:30.214
Please, no.

53:30.247 --> 53:31.515
Please, yes.

53:32.383 --> 53:33.617
Lose it.

53:38.489 --> 53:41.225
Yeah, shake it, baby.
Show us what you got.

53:45.829 --> 53:47.664
Please! Why are you doing this?

53:49.100 --> 53:50.934
Lose the skirt.

53:58.742 --> 54:01.012
I just haven't decided...

54:01.045 --> 54:03.714
what I wanna do with you yet.

54:04.515 --> 54:08.019
Your eyes are really pretty.

54:11.088 --> 54:13.657
There's just something so sexy

54:13.690 --> 54:16.760
about those
little white panties.

54:17.995 --> 54:19.396
Yeah, you like that?

54:19.430 --> 54:20.464
Can I do some coke?

54:20.497 --> 54:22.533
Abso-fucking-lutely.

54:25.569 --> 54:27.071
You taste good.

54:27.104 --> 54:28.272
Nice and ripe.

54:30.107 --> 54:32.876
Ladies...

54:32.909 --> 54:34.811
John's not here.

54:36.580 --> 54:39.916
I'm gonna make you look
so pretty!

54:41.518 --> 54:42.586
Scalpel.

54:44.221 --> 54:46.357
Hold this bitch still.
She's squirmin'.

54:47.691 --> 54:49.560
Go for the cornea!

54:49.593 --> 54:51.962
Does that look like
the fucking cornea to you?!

54:51.995 --> 54:54.698
Sorry, Dr. San Diego!
Fucking keep her still!

54:56.400 --> 54:57.701
Keep screaming!

54:57.734 --> 55:00.204
Do you think anyone'll hear you?

55:00.237 --> 55:01.438
Or that anybody would care?

55:06.009 --> 55:08.812
You're right.
She does have beautiful eyes!

55:10.614 --> 55:12.316
She might be prettier now.

55:15.686 --> 55:19.390
If you'd have cut her cornea
she'd be dead already.

55:19.423 --> 55:20.991
Is that brain matter...

55:21.825 --> 55:23.227
Dr. San Diego?

55:32.536 --> 55:34.805
Somebody needs to clean this up
before john gets back.

56:16.012 --> 56:18.014
Dear Megan.

56:18.048 --> 56:20.016
I hope this letter reaches you

56:20.050 --> 56:21.685
and you some day understand

56:21.718 --> 56:24.020
that I'm not the person
you think I am.

56:25.989 --> 56:29.926
I know you have no desire
to see me for what I did.

56:29.960 --> 56:31.795
I used to pray every day

56:31.828 --> 56:35.966
that my baby girl would walk
through the doors to visit me.

56:35.999 --> 56:37.834
As time went on,

56:37.868 --> 56:39.403
and as you got older,

56:39.436 --> 56:42.606
I finally realized my prayers
were a waste

56:42.639 --> 56:44.775
and I came to the harsh reality

56:44.808 --> 56:46.710
that I would never
see you again.

56:49.112 --> 56:50.447
Megan, you have no idea

56:50.481 --> 56:53.049
the pain your father
caused me and you.

56:53.083 --> 56:55.018
You were too young to remember.

56:56.353 --> 56:59.490
Your young mind suppressed
many of the evil things

56:59.523 --> 57:01.325
he did to you,

57:01.358 --> 57:03.059
so rather than hurt you

57:03.093 --> 57:05.796
and tell you the things he did,

57:05.829 --> 57:10.367
I decided to let you have
the wonderful memories of him.

57:10.401 --> 57:15.672
I've come to a point, Megan,
where my life will soon be over.

57:15.706 --> 57:18.242
I can no longer sit
behind these walls

57:18.275 --> 57:21.545
and not let you know
the truth of that night.

57:21.578 --> 57:24.881
I cannot go on
and you not know the truth

57:24.915 --> 57:27.050
of why I did what I did.

57:29.253 --> 57:31.355
Your father was a womanizer.

57:31.388 --> 57:35.226
He was a physically
abusive drunk to me

57:35.259 --> 57:37.761
and he verbally abused me
to the point

57:37.794 --> 57:39.863
that I became...

57:39.896 --> 57:43.267
the drug addict
that you know me as today.

57:43.300 --> 57:45.202
You were just a little girl.

57:45.236 --> 57:46.903
You were my baby girl...

57:48.004 --> 57:50.241
and when I saw him
doing those sick things

57:50.274 --> 57:52.075
to your body...

57:52.108 --> 57:54.245
when I saw him inside of you,

57:54.278 --> 57:56.280
I was left with no choice.

57:57.548 --> 57:59.483
I had to do what I did.

58:00.617 --> 58:04.388
Megan, you will always
be my baby girl,

58:04.421 --> 58:08.058
but if you never learn
anything else from me...

58:08.091 --> 58:09.960
know that someday
you will be faced

58:09.993 --> 58:11.462
with a decision.

58:12.596 --> 58:14.698
A decision so extreme

58:14.731 --> 58:17.234
that no one will have your back.

58:18.302 --> 58:21.204
But know in that time of choice,

58:21.238 --> 58:24.408
that your mother
will be looking over you

58:24.441 --> 58:30.113
and I will never let anyone
hurt my baby girl again.

58:30.146 --> 58:31.815
I love you, Megan.

58:32.516 --> 58:35.185
Love always, Mom.

58:59.876 --> 59:01.845
Holy shit! Why do you do that?

59:01.878 --> 59:04.114
- I got you, bitch!
- You do that every time.

59:04.147 --> 59:05.716
- What's this?
- Jesus.

59:05.749 --> 59:07.349
- What are you doing out here?
- Nothing.

59:07.374 --> 59:09.753
It's just something I've been
thinking about lately.

59:09.786 --> 59:11.522
You're thinking about
going to college?

59:11.555 --> 59:13.324
Yeah, I am.

59:13.357 --> 59:15.158
I mean, I feel like it's time
to finally

59:15.191 --> 59:16.327
get my life together.

59:16.360 --> 59:19.195
- It's about damn time.
- Yeah. I know.

59:19.229 --> 59:24.134
So, which one of these
are you planning on doing?

59:24.167 --> 59:27.938
I was thinking about
the counseling one, actually.

59:27.971 --> 59:29.373
- Counseling?
- Yeah.

59:29.406 --> 59:31.308
Because you're so fucked up
already, right?

59:31.342 --> 59:33.610
Yeah. Is that not perfect?

59:33.644 --> 59:34.678
It's pretty perfect.

59:34.711 --> 59:36.647
I honestly... I think
I'd be really good at that.

59:36.680 --> 59:40.651
Megan, did you see this tuition?

59:40.684 --> 59:42.653
How are you ever
gonna afford that.

59:42.686 --> 59:45.389
- It's expensive.
- It's really not that bad.

59:45.422 --> 59:48.959
So, I figure with all the money
I'm making stripping now,

59:48.992 --> 59:50.594
- I can have that.
- I'm sorry. What?!

59:50.627 --> 59:51.795
Excuse me?

59:51.828 --> 59:54.230
I mean, I told you that.
I told you about that.

59:54.264 --> 59:57.033
Megan, what the fuck?
I told Bobby...

59:58.034 --> 59:59.736
Enough with Bobby. I don't care.

59:59.770 --> 01:00:01.304
It's none of his business.

01:00:01.338 --> 01:00:03.507
I'm making money
and that's all I care about.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.775
That's all that matters.

01:00:07.811 --> 01:00:10.146
What? See? You're judging me!

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.815
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

01:00:11.848 --> 01:00:14.685
You know what?
I've had your back this long.

01:00:14.718 --> 01:00:16.052
Fuck it. Just do it.

01:00:16.086 --> 01:00:17.320
Just be careful.

01:00:17.354 --> 01:00:18.489
Okay?

01:00:18.522 --> 01:00:19.856
You serious?

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:22.659
Just-just don't go
fuckin' people in VIP!

01:00:22.693 --> 01:00:24.194
Gross.

01:00:24.227 --> 01:00:25.429
I know.

01:00:30.033 --> 01:00:32.068
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

01:00:32.102 --> 01:00:33.069
Are you new here?

01:00:33.103 --> 01:00:34.471
Yeah, it's my second night.

01:00:34.505 --> 01:00:36.239
I mean, I've been bartending
for years,

01:00:36.272 --> 01:00:37.874
but I'm new to this pace.

01:00:37.908 --> 01:00:39.710
Gotcha. Good luck.

01:00:39.743 --> 01:00:42.679
It's interesting here,
to say the least.

01:00:42.713 --> 01:00:44.981
Yeah. I'm really noticing that.

01:00:45.015 --> 01:00:48.519
So, are you and Sarah gonna be
splitting shifts, or...?

01:00:48.552 --> 01:00:50.654
No, hun. I'm full time.

01:00:52.288 --> 01:00:54.090
So, did they fire Sarah?

01:00:55.258 --> 01:00:57.258
I dunno. They just said
they were down a bartender,

01:00:57.283 --> 01:01:00.053
and they needed somebody
full time.

01:01:00.897 --> 01:01:04.635
Okay.
Well, it was nice meeting you.

01:01:04.668 --> 01:01:06.236
Sorry. It's Lauren.

01:01:06.269 --> 01:01:07.871
- Hi. Megan.
- Nice to meet you.

01:01:07.904 --> 01:01:09.540
Well, gotta go meet the bossman.

01:01:09.573 --> 01:01:10.907
Have fun with that.

01:01:35.365 --> 01:01:36.399
Thank you.

01:01:42.338 --> 01:01:43.674
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

01:01:43.707 --> 01:01:44.675
How are you?

01:01:44.708 --> 01:01:46.109
How much is VIP?

01:01:46.142 --> 01:01:50.246
It's usually 150, but I don't-
I don't usually...

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.815
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:01:51.848 --> 01:01:54.951
Don't even waste your time
with Little Miss Priss,

01:01:54.985 --> 01:01:56.587
afraid of dicks.

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.055
She's a waitress, so, you know,

01:01:59.089 --> 01:02:00.929
if you need somebody
to fetch you another beer,

01:02:00.954 --> 01:02:03.093
she's pretty good at that.

01:02:03.126 --> 01:02:07.330
Or, actually, you're not even
very good at that, either.

01:02:07.363 --> 01:02:09.432
So you think you can handle me?

01:02:09.466 --> 01:02:11.334
You think you can handle me?

01:02:11.367 --> 01:02:12.636
I think I can.

01:02:12.669 --> 01:02:14.705
♪

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.276
And that's why you'll
never even be able to afford...

01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:22.078
community college.

01:02:34.024 --> 01:02:35.992
- Hey, John?
- Yeah?

01:02:36.026 --> 01:02:38.562
Can I ask you a question?

01:02:38.595 --> 01:02:39.663
Sure.

01:02:39.696 --> 01:02:40.697
What's goin' on?

01:02:40.731 --> 01:02:42.365
So...

01:02:42.398 --> 01:02:43.934
The girls...

01:02:44.835 --> 01:02:46.136
This is about the girls again?

01:02:46.169 --> 01:02:47.137
Yeah, I...

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:48.505
All right, look.

01:02:48.539 --> 01:02:50.779
I'm actually on my way to a
meeting right now, all right?

01:02:50.804 --> 01:02:53.544
So I just don't really
have time right this second.

01:02:53.577 --> 01:02:55.045
Just get back to work,

01:02:55.078 --> 01:02:57.748
and we'll talk about it
when we get done after. Okay?

01:02:57.781 --> 01:02:59.015
Thanks.

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:09.624
You know what? Other than that,

01:03:09.649 --> 01:03:11.728
I really don't see
any other issues

01:03:11.762 --> 01:03:13.229
with anything at the bar.

01:03:14.998 --> 01:03:17.100
You guys are keeping
everything clean, that's good.

01:03:17.133 --> 01:03:19.936
The only problem
I'm having right now...

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:22.072
If your fucking staff
can't start showing up on time,

01:03:22.105 --> 01:03:24.541
I swear to God, I'm gonna,
like, flip my shit.

01:03:24.575 --> 01:03:25.609
Like, for real.

01:03:25.642 --> 01:03:27.043
If you can't get them in line,

01:03:27.077 --> 01:03:28.877
then I'm going to find
somebody else that can.

01:03:28.902 --> 01:03:31.404
Okay? You got it?

01:03:32.382 --> 01:03:33.617
All right, we're good. Thanks.

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:35.185
We'll chat about it later, okay?

01:03:35.218 --> 01:03:37.320
- All right. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:03:37.353 --> 01:03:38.755
- Hey!
- Hi.

01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:39.956
Have a seat.

01:03:40.757 --> 01:03:42.726
- How you doin'?
- Good, thanks.

01:03:42.759 --> 01:03:43.760
Yeah?

01:03:44.661 --> 01:03:47.363
So, a little birdie tell me
that you're thinking

01:03:47.397 --> 01:03:49.199
about going back to school.

01:03:50.233 --> 01:03:51.935
Yeah. I am.

01:03:51.968 --> 01:03:54.070
How did you-
how did you know that?

01:03:55.105 --> 01:03:57.140
'Cause I know everything
about you, Megan.

01:03:58.942 --> 01:04:01.411
I'm kidding! Relax.

01:04:01.444 --> 01:04:03.146
- Bobby told me.
- Okay.

01:04:03.179 --> 01:04:05.115
All right?

01:04:05.148 --> 01:04:07.550
No, I asked you
in here 'cause...

01:04:07.584 --> 01:04:08.864
I wanna invite you to a party.

01:04:08.889 --> 01:04:11.221
A pool party that I'm having
over at my house on Sunday.

01:04:11.254 --> 01:04:12.756
We try to get together
outside of work

01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:14.725
and have a little fun. You know?

01:04:15.959 --> 01:04:17.999
- Yeah... I don't know.
- Well, what's stopping you?

01:04:18.024 --> 01:04:19.763
I mean, it's not like
we gotta work, right?

01:04:19.796 --> 01:04:21.264
Yeah, well...

01:04:21.297 --> 01:04:22.532
To be honest with you,

01:04:22.565 --> 01:04:24.367
I don't really think
the other girls...

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.136
That shit again.

01:04:28.104 --> 01:04:31.241
Megan... they're jealous, okay?

01:04:31.274 --> 01:04:32.909
This isn't personal.

01:04:32.943 --> 01:04:35.245
It's work, all right? Look.

01:04:35.278 --> 01:04:37.278
In a few more weeks,
you're probably gonna be doing

01:04:37.303 --> 01:04:40.273
the exact same thing
to one of the other girls.

01:04:43.019 --> 01:04:44.788
- Well, yeah...
- Come on.

01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:46.857
Look. I really want you to come.

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:48.458
Come on. It'll be fun.

01:04:50.493 --> 01:04:51.494
Come on.

01:04:52.228 --> 01:04:53.930
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah. Yeah?

01:04:53.964 --> 01:04:55.431
You talked me into it.

01:04:55.465 --> 01:04:57.200
I did just buy
a new bathing suit.

01:04:57.233 --> 01:04:58.869
- Perfect!
- So that works out.

01:04:58.902 --> 01:05:00.603
That does. That works out great.

01:05:00.637 --> 01:05:02.405
Look, I'll text you
the details later, okay?

01:05:02.438 --> 01:05:04.240
- Okay.
- So do me a favor.

01:05:05.408 --> 01:05:07.488
Get back out there and make me
some money, all right?

01:05:07.513 --> 01:05:09.045
Okay. Yes, sir.

01:05:09.079 --> 01:05:10.346
Good.

01:05:30.701 --> 01:05:31.935
Hey, girl. What's up?

01:05:32.568 --> 01:05:34.170
Vodka, please.

01:05:35.405 --> 01:05:38.441
Coming up. Having one
of those nights?

01:05:38.474 --> 01:05:39.776
I am, too.

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:42.312
Girls here are fuckin' bitches.

01:05:42.345 --> 01:05:43.579
Got that right.

01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:55.692
So, are you gonna go
to that party tomorrow?

01:05:55.726 --> 01:05:58.995
No. I guess I didn't get
an invite to that.

01:05:59.029 --> 01:06:00.764
It's probably
because I'm so new.

01:06:00.797 --> 01:06:01.998
Yeah, well...

01:06:02.032 --> 01:06:03.834
Probably not missing
too much anyway.

01:06:03.867 --> 01:06:06.107
It's okay. My boyfriend is
coming in from South Carolina,

01:06:06.132 --> 01:06:08.538
so I'll be tied up,
anyway... literally.

01:06:08.571 --> 01:06:11.541
- Nice.
- Yeah.

01:06:11.574 --> 01:06:13.710
- You enjoy that.
- I always do.

01:06:16.646 --> 01:06:18.614
Hey, Megan.

01:06:18.648 --> 01:06:19.850
Good try.

01:06:19.883 --> 01:06:21.084
What are you doing?

01:06:21.117 --> 01:06:23.486
So, this is what Bobby makes
you do to get the debit card?

01:06:24.587 --> 01:06:26.723
Whatever.
I spilled my wine, bitch.

01:06:26.757 --> 01:06:29.325
But I do have it today
if you wanna go shopping.

01:06:29.359 --> 01:06:31.728
- I do need to go shopping, actually.
- Good.

01:06:31.762 --> 01:06:33.263
I need an outfit for tomorrow.

01:06:33.296 --> 01:06:37.067
Tomorrow? So, what's tomorrow?

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:41.905
Well, John invited me
to his pool party.

01:06:41.938 --> 01:06:43.073
He really wants me to go.

01:06:43.106 --> 01:06:45.108
- John.
- So I'm gonna go.

01:06:45.141 --> 01:06:47.844
So, you're liking
the strip club thing, then?

01:06:47.878 --> 01:06:51.081
I wouldn't say
I'm liking it, exactly.

01:06:51.114 --> 01:06:53.116
He's just being really sweet
to me,

01:06:53.149 --> 01:06:55.952
and I trust the guy, so...

01:06:56.949 --> 01:06:58.029
gonna keep workin' there

01:06:58.054 --> 01:07:00.123
until I can make enough money
for school.

01:07:00.156 --> 01:07:02.625
So, you're telling me
that Bobby was right?

01:07:02.658 --> 01:07:04.594
- You're gonna be okay there?
- Yeah.

01:07:04.627 --> 01:07:06.763
I hate it when Bobby's right.

01:07:07.663 --> 01:07:08.832
Now I owe him money.

01:07:08.865 --> 01:07:10.834
So, do you know
if Bobby's gonna go tomorrow?

01:07:10.867 --> 01:07:12.769
No, he went out of town
this morning.

01:07:14.871 --> 01:07:16.306
So, where did he go?

01:07:16.339 --> 01:07:18.641
Frat house reunion...

01:07:18.674 --> 01:07:20.234
- Frat house?
- With his little boys.

01:07:20.259 --> 01:07:21.778
- Yeah.
- Frat guy?

01:07:21.812 --> 01:07:24.080
Yeah, I know.

01:07:24.114 --> 01:07:26.449
So, do you wanna
come with me tomorrow?

01:07:26.482 --> 01:07:29.085
I would, but I can't.
I picked up a shift at work.

01:07:29.119 --> 01:07:30.353
Have a drink for me, though.

01:07:30.386 --> 01:07:32.122
I'm a little jealous right now.

01:07:32.155 --> 01:07:33.589
I have to be all by myself.

01:07:33.623 --> 01:07:36.459
Yeah, but John will be there,
so you'll be just fine.

01:07:36.492 --> 01:07:38.795
Yeah, whatever.

01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:41.097
So, go shower off your bad
decisions from the strip club

01:07:41.131 --> 01:07:42.432
because I wanna go shopping.

01:07:42.465 --> 01:07:43.766
- Okay?
- You're so rude.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.080
- You love me, though.
- So rude.

01:07:45.105 --> 01:07:46.140
Okay.

I am actually.

01:11:49.912 --> 01:11:51.514

01:11:51.547 --> 01:11:53.883

a good time, but...

01:11:53.916 --> 01:11:55.285
Well, why not?

01:11:55.318 --> 01:11:56.452
Why do you think?

01:11:57.653 --> 01:11:59.021
I told you not to worry
about them.

01:11:59.055 --> 01:12:00.223
Speak of the devil.

01:12:00.256 --> 01:12:01.857
Hi, guys!

01:12:02.558 --> 01:12:04.227
What can I do for you, Jazz?

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.895
What can you do me for?

01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:10.366
Look who it is!
My favorite waitress!

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.601
Hi, Jazz.

01:12:12.502 --> 01:12:14.404
So, you invited her?

01:12:15.105 --> 01:12:16.939
Yes, I did.

01:12:17.707 --> 01:12:18.874
Is that a problem?

01:12:18.908 --> 01:12:20.443
No, I'm glad that you did.

01:12:20.476 --> 01:12:23.346
Actually, it's really nice
to see you. You look...

01:12:23.379 --> 01:12:25.515
so pretty today.

01:12:26.282 --> 01:12:28.818
John, she's so pretty.

01:12:28.851 --> 01:12:30.753
I see why you hired her now.

01:12:31.754 --> 01:12:33.314
Look at that little freckle
on her nose.

01:12:33.339 --> 01:12:35.291
I never noticed that before.

01:12:35.325 --> 01:12:38.694
Little freckle on your nose!
I got your nose!

01:12:42.298 --> 01:12:43.533
Are you about done?

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.401
No... Well, I don't know.

01:12:45.435 --> 01:12:46.902
Can I-
can I get you guys a drink?

01:12:46.936 --> 01:12:48.771
How 'bout a peace offering?

01:12:48.804 --> 01:12:50.306
I work for you now.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.808
What can I get for ya?

01:12:55.478 --> 01:12:56.679
You being serious?

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.948
Yeah, I'm being serious.

01:12:58.981 --> 01:13:02.485
John can tell you, I mean,
I put up a big front, but...

01:13:02.518 --> 01:13:05.521
when you get to know me, I'm
actually a really good person.

01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:10.360
So, yeah, peace offering.
What can I get you to drink?

01:13:11.927 --> 01:13:13.687
I still can't tell
if you're fucking with me,

01:13:13.712 --> 01:13:15.665
or not, honestly.

01:13:15.698 --> 01:13:17.058
But if you're gonna
get me a drink,

01:13:17.083 --> 01:13:18.785
I guess just surprise me.

01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:21.371
I'm full of surprises.

01:13:25.708 --> 01:13:27.677
Don't sweat it. Don't sweat it.

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:30.980
I mean, like I said before,
she fucks with everybody.

01:13:31.013 --> 01:13:33.716
You know? Everybody.

01:13:33.749 --> 01:13:35.385
It'll stop.

01:13:35.418 --> 01:13:36.652
Will it?

01:13:37.753 --> 01:13:39.289
It'll stop. Trust me.

01:13:39.922 --> 01:13:41.123
- Trust me.
- I hope so.

01:13:41.157 --> 01:13:42.692
I'll take care of it, okay?

01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:02.478
I'll take care of it.

01:14:02.512 --> 01:14:04.380
Here you go, my lovely.

01:14:05.715 --> 01:14:06.882
Thank you.

01:14:06.916 --> 01:14:08.451
My pleasure.

01:14:08.484 --> 01:14:09.719
What is it?

01:14:09.752 --> 01:14:12.655
It's vanilla vodka and soda.

01:14:12.688 --> 01:14:14.089
It's good. Try it.

01:14:15.658 --> 01:14:17.893
It's not too many calories...

01:14:19.229 --> 01:14:21.897
Could you make it any stronger?
Jesus.

01:14:21.931 --> 01:14:23.599
But it's good that way.

01:14:23.633 --> 01:14:24.867
Right?

01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:27.069
Thank you. I appreciate it.

01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:28.971
My pleasure.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.041
That'll be all. Thank you.

01:14:32.074 --> 01:14:33.576
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:14:34.277 --> 01:14:35.911
All right.

01:14:37.213 --> 01:14:38.281
Okay.

01:14:45.221 --> 01:14:47.723
Wooh! Swell party, John.

01:14:47.757 --> 01:14:49.459
This is exciting.

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.296
I don't know. Your date
looks a little bored.

01:14:54.364 --> 01:14:56.932
She does, doesn't she?

01:14:56.966 --> 01:14:59.034
- Megan?
- Or is she just sleepy?

01:15:01.003 --> 01:15:02.738
Megan, you bored?

01:15:09.345 --> 01:15:12.582
Well, as usual,
I'm fucking bored.

01:15:12.615 --> 01:15:14.350
Bottom's up, waitress!

01:15:15.084 --> 01:15:16.719
Jesus Christ, Jazz!

01:15:16.752 --> 01:15:18.120
Really?

01:15:18.988 --> 01:15:20.590
You couldn't have waited
ten minutes?

01:15:23.259 --> 01:15:24.794
I know. I'm so eager.

01:15:30.966 --> 01:15:34.970
You know, my cousin, Alan's,
like, obsessed with bottles.

01:15:35.004 --> 01:15:38.107
Like, he has a fetish
for bottles.

01:15:42.878 --> 01:15:45.681
- Go on.
- Well, you know why, right?

01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:49.452
Enlighten me.

01:15:49.485 --> 01:15:50.720
Please.

01:15:51.754 --> 01:15:52.988
Well...

01:15:54.023 --> 01:15:55.758
His dad...

01:15:55.791 --> 01:15:57.226
my uncle...

01:15:57.927 --> 01:15:59.995
used to fuck him...

01:16:00.029 --> 01:16:01.597
and when he would fuck him,

01:16:01.631 --> 01:16:04.133
he would just focus on a bottle.

01:16:06.602 --> 01:16:08.070
That's why he's obsessed.

01:16:11.341 --> 01:16:13.142
So that's why I like armpits.

01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:17.613
This is tragically
fucking boring.

01:16:17.647 --> 01:16:20.583
John, what are we gonna do
with this scrawny little twat?

01:16:23.453 --> 01:16:27.056
Why don't we give her...
a fetish?

01:16:36.999 --> 01:16:39.001
Look at her eyes.

01:16:39.034 --> 01:16:40.703
Is she dead?

01:16:48.811 --> 01:16:51.714
Oh, god.
Would you wake her ass up?

01:16:51.747 --> 01:16:53.649
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:16:53.683 --> 01:16:56.486
Only bitch I know,
can do ten lines of blow

01:16:56.519 --> 01:16:58.153
and still passes out.

01:16:58.187 --> 01:17:00.255
It's just getting exciting.
