<b>This season on "Ink Master,"</i> </b>

00:03.604 --> 00:06.606
<b> <i>it's Peck versus Nuñez.</i> </b>

00:06.607 --> 00:10.476
<b> <i>On the last episode, a massive</i> </b>
<b> <i>twist changed the game.</i> </b>

00:10.477 --> 00:12.945
<b>- Before you can battle the</b>
<b>opposing team,</b>

00:12.946 --> 00:16.315
<b>you must first battle your own.</b>

00:16.315 --> 00:17.817
<b>- What the [bleep]</b>
<b>does that mean?</b>

00:17.818 --> 00:20.753
<b>- Each week, only one team will</b>
<b>be up for elimination.</b>

00:20.754 --> 00:22.455
<b>The judges will weed out the</b>
<b>weakest</b>

00:22.456 --> 00:24.624
<b>until the top ten artists</b>
<b>remain.</b>

00:24.625 --> 00:28.361
<b>- What?</b> <b>This is true insanity.</b>

00:28.362 --> 00:29.595
<b>- Oh, yeah.</b>

<b> <i>announcer:</b>
<b>In the flash challenge,</i> </b>

00:31.565 --> 00:33.666
<b> <i>teams fought for the advantage.</i> </b>

00:33.667 --> 00:36.536
<b> <i>- The team that wins this flash</i> </b>
<b> <i>challenge will be safe</i> </b>

00:36.537 --> 00:38.604
<b> <i>from elimination this week.</i> </b>

00:38.605 --> 00:40.206
<b>- Careful how over-smooth</b>
<b>you get.</b>

00:40.207 --> 00:42.275
<b>If one comes out different from</b>
<b>the others,</b>

00:42.276 --> 00:44.911
<b>you might be on the chopping</b>
<b>block for it as a team.</b>

00:44.912 --> 00:46.846
<b>- This is why I hate working in</b>
<b>teams.</b>

00:46.847 --> 00:49.348
<b>- This is a team move, so you</b>
<b>guys all win together.</b>

00:49.349 --> 00:53.119
<b>- The winner of the flash</b>
<b>challenge is Team Peck.</b>

00:53.120 --> 00:54.720
<b>- Yes!</b>

00:54.721 --> 00:57.123
<b>- Everybody on the other team</b>
<b>looked at our tattoo,</b>

00:57.124 --> 00:58.858
<b>and y'all know we did that</b>
<b>[bleep].</b>

00:58.859 --> 01:00.092
<b>- Was our tattoo better than</b>
<b>y'all's?</b>

01:00.093 --> 01:01.694
<b>Just ask... answer the [bleep]</b>
<b>question.</b>

01:01.695 --> 01:02.962
<b>Was the tattoo better?</b>

01:02.963 --> 01:04.330
<b>- I think it's [bleep]</b>
<b>up when you come</b>

01:04.331 --> 01:07.867

<b> <i>Team Nuñez had to battle their</i> </b>

01:13.307 --> 01:15.374

01:15.375 --> 01:17.076
<b>but we may have [bleep]</b>

01:17.077 --> 01:21.414

01:30.824 --> 01:32.091
<b>- I'm a strong competitor.</b>

01:32.092 --> 01:33.326

01:33.327 --> 01:34.760

01:53.113 --> 01:56.449

03:39.319 --> 03:40.319

04:15.956 --> 04:18.791
<b>Team Nuñez competed in the last</b>
<b>elimination tattoo.</b>

04:18.791 --> 04:23.563
<b>So that means this week, Team</b>
<b>Peck, you're up for elimination.</b>

04:23.564 --> 04:26.465
<b>Each judge must thin out his</b>
<b>group until only</b>

04:26.466 --> 04:29.235
<b>the top five artists remain on</b>

04:29.236 --> 04:31.237
<b>The pressure is on.</b>

04:31.238 --> 04:34.140
<b>This week, we're testing...</b>

04:34.141 --> 04:35.741
<b>precision.</b>

04:35.742 --> 04:37.310
<b>- What?</b>

04:37.311 --> 04:39.545
<b> <i>- Precision means your lines</i> </b>
<b> <i>are perfect.</i> </b>

04:39.546 --> 04:41.514
<b>Your color is laid in evenly.</b>

04:41.515 --> 04:44.183
<b> <i>You have tiny, minute details.</i> </b>

04:44.184 --> 04:46.285
<b> <i>If a tattoo artist doesn't have</i> </b>
<b> <i>precision,</i> </b>

04:46.286 --> 04:50.857
<b>the tattoo comes off as sloppy</b>
<b>or even unprofessional.</b>

04:50.858 --> 04:52.859
<b>- To handle the pressure of this</b>
<b>competition,</b>

04:52.860 --> 04:55.094
<b>you must be able to keep your</b>
<b>cool.</b>

04:55.095 --> 04:59.131
<b>Corona believes it's important</b>
<b>to stay positive and grounded.</b>

04:59.132 --> 05:02.802
<b>Sometimes you have to take a</b>
<b>step back and be carefree,</b>

05:02.803 --> 05:05.571
<b>and that is called finding your</b>
<b>beach.</b>

05:05.572 --> 05:08.075
<b>Today, we've brought the beach</b>
<b>here.</b>

05:11.111 --> 05:14.113
<b>Team Nuñez, you're safe from</b>
<b>elimination this week,</b>

05:14.114 --> 05:16.516
<b>and you are calling the shots.</b>

05:16.517 --> 05:19.652
<b>For this flash challenge,</b>
<b>Team Peck must help each of you</b>

05:19.653 --> 05:22.922
<b>find your beach...</b>

05:22.923 --> 05:26.459
<b>by sculpting it.</b>

05:26.460 --> 05:27.627
<b>- Just 'cause I'm</b>
<b>from Puerto Rico</b>

05:27.628 --> 05:29.228
<b>doesn't mean I like to play with</b>
<b>sand.</b>

05:29.229 --> 05:30.796
<b>- Really?</b>

05:30.797 --> 05:32.865
<b>There's a saying, "Never build a</b>
<b>house on a sandy foundation."</b>

05:32.866 --> 05:34.100
<b>Sand is unpredictable.</b>

05:34.101 --> 05:35.501
<b> <i>It could fall apart at any time.</i> </b>

05:35.502 --> 05:37.336
<b>How are we gonna show precision?</b>

05:37.337 --> 05:40.306
<b>- Team Nuñez, it's up to you to</b>
<b>decide, as a team,</b>

05:40.307 --> 05:42.241
<b>which one of you will</b>
<b>be paired up</b>

05:42.242 --> 05:44.610
<b>with each artist from Team Peck.</b>

05:44.611 --> 05:47.747
<b>Your beach can be anything that</b>
<b>puts you in a laid-back,</b>

05:47.748 --> 05:52.351
<b>positive state of mind and helps</b>
<b>you find your happy place.</b>

05:52.352 --> 05:54.987
<b>Kelly, you won the last</b>
<b>elimination tattoo.</b>

05:54.988 --> 05:57.924
<b>Because there are more artists</b>
<b>on Team Peck than Team Nuñez,</b>

05:57.925 --> 06:02.461
<b>two artists will sculpt your</b>
<b>beach.</b>

06:02.462 --> 06:04.697
<b>Take a moment to talk as a team</b>
<b>and decide</b>

06:04.698 --> 06:06.732
<b>who is going to be paired up.</b>

06:06.733 --> 06:09.168
<b>- We want them to have a hard</b>
<b>time with this thing.</b>

06:09.169 --> 06:11.671
<b>- Do we want to lob someone an</b>
<b>easy ball?</b>

06:11.672 --> 06:13.439
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- Someone has to win.</b>

06:13.440 --> 06:15.641
<b>- My team today is</b>
<b>on a bye week.</b>

06:15.642 --> 06:17.210
<b> <i>They don't have to compete.</i> </b>

06:17.211 --> 06:19.478
<b> <i>Hopefully my team plays smart</i> </b>
<b> <i>so that Team Peck's</i> </b>

06:19.479 --> 06:21.147
<b> <i>top tattooer</i> </b>
<b> <i>doesn't get skull pick.</i> </b>

06:21.148 --> 06:23.115
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>Team Nuñez, one by one,</b>

06:23.116 --> 06:26.619
<b>please reveal which artist</b>
<b>must help you find your beach.</b>

06:26.620 --> 06:27.753
<b>Kelly.</b>

06:27.754 --> 06:30.223
<b>- I want to work</b>
<b>with Ryan and Matt.</b>

06:30.224 --> 06:32.658
<b>I don't want to see</b>
<b>Ryan or Matt fail.</b>

06:32.659 --> 06:34.760
<b> <i>I'm trying to play fair.</i> </b>

06:34.761 --> 06:36.829
<b>- I want to take Gian.</b>

06:36.830 --> 06:38.130
<b>- Nate.</b>

06:38.131 --> 06:39.632
<b>- I'm gonna take Dave.</b>

06:39.633 --> 06:41.133
<b>- Boneface.</b>

06:41.134 --> 06:44.770
<b>The last flash challenge,</b>
<b>Boneface didn't do [bleep].</b>

06:44.771 --> 06:47.373
<b>- Hey, Boneface, we do need</b>
<b>someone to keep time.</b>

06:47.374 --> 06:50.076
<b>- I worked.</b> <b>Now it's your turn.</b>

06:50.077 --> 06:51.410
<b>- I'm gonna work with Geary.</b>

06:51.411 --> 06:53.112
<b>- I'm gonna take Mike.</b>

06:53.113 --> 06:54.814
<b>- I'm gonna work with Gia.</b>

06:54.815 --> 06:57.617
<b>Last week, Gia gave me the worst</b>
<b>canvas, but now it's personal.</b>

06:57.618 --> 06:59.085
<b> <i>Gia shoot for me first.</i> </b>

06:59.086 --> 07:01.721
<b>Tuff Tito's shooting back</b>
<b>right now.</b>

07:01.722 --> 07:03.623
<b>- The winner of the flash</b>
<b>challenge will have</b>

07:03.624 --> 07:06.025
<b>the power to assign</b>
<b>all human canvases</b>

07:06.026 --> 07:07.693
<b>in the elimination tattoo.</b>

07:07.694 --> 07:10.096

<b>for elimination.</b>

07:18.872 --> 07:20.306
<b>- How do you want this to go?</b>

07:20.307 --> 07:22.475
<b>- The twist to this challenge is</b>
<b>that the opposing team</b>

07:22.476 --> 07:26.445
<b>is gonna dictate to my team what</b>
<b>it is they have to sculpt.</b>

07:26.446 --> 07:28.814
<b>- King Neptune holding a Corona.</b>

07:28.815 --> 07:30.750
<b>- Your competitor giving you a</b>
<b>challenge...</b>

07:30.751 --> 07:32.618
<b> <i>chances are,</i> </b>
<b> <i>they're gonna make it tricky.</i> </b>

07:32.619 --> 07:35.555
<b>- I love Gothic architecture.</b>

07:35.556 --> 07:37.757
<b>- I want two palm tree</b>
<b>and a hammock.</b>

07:37.758 --> 07:39.091
<b>- Really?</b>

07:39.092 --> 07:43.062
<b>- My beach is a concert setting,</b>
<b>watching live music.</b>

07:43.063 --> 07:46.499
<b>- More than one, like, person</b>
<b>playing an instrument?</b>

07:46.500 --> 07:48.601
<b>- I mean, it's precision, so</b>
<b>yeah.</b>

<b> <i>- Nikki is playing the game.</i> </b>

07:50.070 --> 07:52.872

<b> <i>let alone a person playing a</i> </b>
<b> <i>music instrument.</i> </b>

07:56.643 --> 07:58.244
<b>- Texas is my beach.</b>

07:58.245 --> 08:01.848
<b>So I was thinking of doing a</b>
<b>longhorn skull,</b>

08:01.849 --> 08:03.816
<b>cowboy boots, and a rattlesnake.</b>

08:03.817 --> 08:05.751

08:05.752 --> 08:07.053
<b>That's a lot of things, man.</b>

08:07.054 --> 08:08.487
<b>- You think so?</b>

08:08.488 --> 08:10.556
<b>- This isn't a sandbox or, like,</b>
<b>a little sandcastle.</b>

08:10.557 --> 08:12.558
<b>It's four tons of sand.</b>

08:12.559 --> 08:14.660
<b>For a sculpture,</b>
<b>that's really difficult.</b>

08:14.661 --> 08:16.028
<b>This is sand.</b>

08:16.029 --> 08:17.789
<b>- Well, you're wasting time</b>
<b>talking about it.</b>

08:23.036 --> 08:25.371

<b>because there's</b>

08:25.372 --> 08:27.106

09:11.485 --> 09:14.520
<b> <i>head-to-head very soon,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but I'm really thinking</i> </b>

09:14.521 --> 09:17.423
<b>it'll be in all of our benefit</b>
<b>for all</b>

09:17.424 --> 09:19.225
<b> <i>of the girls to work together.</i> </b>

09:19.226 --> 09:20.493
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

09:20.494 --> 09:21.761
<b>You're so smart.</b>

09:21.762 --> 09:22.895
<b>I [bleep] love you.</b>

09:22.896 --> 09:24.631
<b>[bleep]</b> <b>the rest of these guys.</b>

09:27.868 --> 09:30.469
<b>- [chuckles]</b>

09:30.470 --> 09:33.039
<b> <i>- My whole sculpture is</i> </b>
<b> <i>literally falling apart.</i> </b>

09:33.040 --> 09:35.074
<b>I don't even think</b>
<b>that I can create</b>

09:35.075 --> 09:36.142
<b>a palm tree at this point.</b>

09:36.143 --> 09:38.778
<b>Damn you, Tito.</b>

09:38.779 --> 09:40.179
<b>There is nothing left.</b>

09:40.180 --> 09:42.048
<b>This is incredibly upsetting.</b>

09:42.049 --> 09:48.221
<b>- Five, four, three, two,</b>
<b>one... that is it.</b>

09:48.222 --> 09:50.257
<b>No more sculpting.</b>

09:52.492 --> 09:54.594
<b>- Palm trees and hammocks.</b>

09:54.595 --> 09:57.597
<b> <i>- Team Nuñez didn't win the</i> </b>
<b> <i>first challenge,</i> </b>

09:57.598 --> 09:59.732
<b> <i>and so they're just gonna be</i> </b>
<b> <i>[bleep] about it</i> </b>

09:59.733 --> 10:02.602
<b>and try to give us a really,</b>
<b>really rough ride.</b>

10:02.603 --> 10:03.904
<b> <i>They're being super [bleep].</i> </b>

10:07.608 --> 10:09.876
<b>- All right, guys.</b>
<b>Let's get into these critiques.</b>

10:09.877 --> 10:12.011
<b>Mike, John asked you to find his</b>
<b>beach.</b>

10:12.012 --> 10:13.412
<b>What was the beach?</b>

10:13.413 --> 10:15.248
<b> <i>- A beautiful woman with toes</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the water</i> </b>

10:15.249 --> 10:16.949
<b> <i>and beer in the sand.</i> </b>

10:16.950 --> 10:18.384
<b>- It's hard to tell if it's</b>
<b>supposed to be a mermaid or not.</b>

10:18.385 --> 10:19.785
<b> <i>Her legs just kind of disappear.</i> </b>

10:19.786 --> 10:21.754
<b> <i>Her breasts are basically</i> </b>
<b> <i>laying on top</i> </b>

10:21.755 --> 10:23.055
<b> <i>of her belly button.</i> </b>

10:23.056 --> 10:24.757
<b>- What I will say is,</b>
<b>the way that you got</b>

10:24.758 --> 10:27.159
<b> <i>the carved-out cheekbone and</i> </b>
<b> <i>the eye...</i> </b>

10:27.160 --> 10:28.461
<b> <i>that's the shining moment.</i> </b>

10:28.462 --> 10:31.464
<b>It is recognizable.</b>

10:31.465 --> 10:34.333
<b>- Nikki, you had Boneface find</b>
<b>your beach.</b>

10:34.334 --> 10:35.902
<b>What exactly is your beach?</b>

10:35.903 --> 10:38.604
<b> <i>- At a show, live music,</i> </b>
<b> <i>concerts...</i> </b>

10:38.605 --> 10:41.207
<b>- I was gonna do a scene with</b>
<b>two guys playing instruments.</b>

10:41.208 --> 10:44.744
<b>Sand said no, so we got a guy</b>
<b>playing bongos now.</b>

10:44.745 --> 10:46.913
<b>- When I walk up and look at</b>
<b>this, I could not come up</b>

10:46.914 --> 10:49.148
<b> <i>with any idea</i> </b>
<b> <i>of what's going on here.</i> </b>

10:49.149 --> 10:52.618
<b>- As far as precision goes...</b>
<b>not too much in there.</b>

10:52.619 --> 10:54.954
<b>- Boneface's sculpture is a</b>
<b>joke, and I just want</b>

10:54.955 --> 10:58.291
<b>to see him in the bottom and out</b>
<b>of here.</b>

10:58.292 --> 11:01.527
<b>- Sirvone, what did you ask Gian</b>
<b>to do?</b>

11:01.528 --> 11:04.197
<b> <i>- The beach with my dog...</i> </b>
<b> <i>the whole idea of a mermaid</i> </b>

11:04.198 --> 11:06.132
<b>coming up, trying to take the</b>
<b>beer.</b>

11:06.133 --> 11:09.836
<b>- The waves in the front are the</b>
<b>only solid, legible piece.</b>

11:09.837 --> 11:12.772
<b>The mermaid looks more like a</b>
<b>weird sea crab.</b>

11:12.773 --> 11:15.975
<b>- The head of the dog that I was</b>
<b>making fell on my face.</b>

11:15.976 --> 11:18.477
<b>- Looks like she's crawling to</b>
<b>her death.</b>

11:18.478 --> 11:21.681
<b>Okay, Eric, what did you ask</b>
<b>Geary to do here?</b>

11:21.682 --> 11:23.316
<b>- Gothic architecture.</b>

11:23.317 --> 11:25.651
<b> <i>- It's a really cool idea,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and it's a great use</i> </b>

11:25.652 --> 11:27.553
<b> <i>of the natural shape of the</i> </b>
<b> <i>block you got.</i> </b>

11:27.554 --> 11:30.156
<b>- This is the one that has</b>
<b>symmetry to it.</b>

11:30.157 --> 11:34.293
<b> <i>Every side has the same depth,</i> </b>
<b> <i>so I think it's a strong take.</i> </b>

11:34.294 --> 11:37.129
<b>- Kevin, what did you want Dave</b>
<b>to do here?</b>

11:37.130 --> 11:39.966
<b> <i>- I wanted him to give me a</i> </b>
<b> <i>couple elements from Texas.</i> </b>

11:39.967 --> 11:42.368
<b> <i>- Where I really think you</i> </b>
<b> <i>shined in this is the snake.</i> </b>

11:42.369 --> 11:44.470
<b> <i>The detail, the shape of the</i> </b>
<b> <i>snake, is awesome.</i> </b>

11:44.471 --> 11:45.771
<b> <i>The flow of the snake going in</i> </b>
<b> <i>and out</i> </b>

11:45.772 --> 11:47.106
<b> <i>of the design is amazing.</i> </b>

11:47.107 --> 11:49.308
<b>- Thank you very much.</b>

11:49.309 --> 11:51.177
<b>- Sketchy,</b>
<b>what did you ask for here?</b>

11:51.178 --> 11:53.880
<b>- Neptune breaching the water</b>
<b>with a Corona.</b>

11:53.881 --> 11:55.515
<b>- The anatomy is really spot-on.</b>

11:55.516 --> 11:57.750
<b> <i>Everything's in proportion.</i> </b>

11:57.751 --> 11:59.285
<b>- A couple different textures</b>
<b>have things what</b>

11:59.286 --> 12:01.554
<b> <i>really bring you into the</i> </b>
<b> <i>precision element of this.</i> </b>

12:01.555 --> 12:04.957
<b>- Particularly the attention to</b>
<b>detail... it doesn't</b>

12:04.958 --> 12:07.493
<b> <i>have the trident, yet I knew</i> </b>
<b> <i>exactly what it was.</i> </b>

12:07.494 --> 12:09.228
<b>- Thank you.</b>

12:09.229 --> 12:11.764
<b>- Kelly and Matt,</b>
<b>what was your beach?</b>

12:11.765 --> 12:14.800
<b>- My beach is back home,</b>
<b>in Salem,</b>

12:14.801 --> 12:16.936
<b>in the cemeteries,</b>
<b>with the witches.</b>

12:16.937 --> 12:19.672
<b>- Chose to do a giant witch face</b>
<b>and incorporate</b>

12:19.673 --> 12:21.507
<b>the graveyard into that on the</b>
<b>brim of the hat.</b>

12:21.508 --> 12:23.176
<b>- It's definitely a recognizable</b>
<b>witch.</b>

12:23.177 --> 12:24.944
<b> <i>You don't have a lot of little</i> </b>
<b> <i>details.</i> </b>

12:24.945 --> 12:27.246
<b>- The hair on the witch... I feel</b>
<b>like some more defined lines</b>

12:27.247 --> 12:29.782
<b> <i>could've really brought that</i> </b>
<b> <i>out a little bit better.</i> </b>

12:29.783 --> 12:30.983
<b>- So Kelly...</b>

12:30.984 --> 12:33.486
<b>- Ryan had the same challenge</b>
<b>as Matt.</b>

12:33.487 --> 12:35.655
<b>- Immediately, the thing that</b>
<b>stands out to me is the cat.</b>

12:35.656 --> 12:38.157
<b>The head, the face... everything</b>
<b>really came together.</b>

12:38.158 --> 12:40.626
<b>- Getting that different clay</b>
<b>color gives you</b>

12:40.627 --> 12:42.728
<b>an element that nobody else in</b>
<b>the room has.</b>

12:42.729 --> 12:45.198
<b>That really helps you stand out.</b>

12:45.199 --> 12:46.465
<b>- Gia.</b>

12:46.466 --> 12:48.334
<b>- Well, in order to find my</b>
<b>beach back home,</b>

12:48.335 --> 12:50.503
<b>I need two palm tree</b>
<b>and a hammock.</b>

12:50.504 --> 12:52.305
<b>- The whole left side collapsed,</b>

12:52.306 --> 12:54.807
<b>so this was done in the last</b>
<b>hour.</b>

12:54.808 --> 12:56.843
<b>- From across the room, it just</b>
<b>looks like nothing.</b>

12:56.844 --> 12:58.845
<b>It's probably one of the weakest</b>
<b>in the room.</b>

12:58.846 --> 13:01.314
<b>- I didn't give up.</b>
<b>I at least made it to the end.</b>

13:01.315 --> 13:02.949
<b>I did the best that I could.</b>

13:02.950 --> 13:04.283
<b> <i>- It's not my beach.</i> </b>

13:04.284 --> 13:05.718
<b>We need to play the game,</b>
<b>and we don't care</b>

13:05.719 --> 13:07.119
<b>who leaving on the other team.</b>

13:07.120 --> 13:08.120
<b> <i>That's part of the plan.</i> </b>

13:10.824 --> 13:13.593
<b>- I'm starting to panic because</b>
<b>there's no time</b>

13:13.594 --> 13:14.794
<b>to finish the tail.</b>

13:14.795 --> 13:15.895
<b>- How long have you guys</b>
<b>been at it?</b>

13:15.896 --> 13:17.496
<b>- He needs to speed it up.</b>

13:17.497 --> 13:19.131
<b> <i>- You're playing a completely</i> </b>
<b> <i>different game,</i> </b>

13:19.132 --> 13:20.766
<b>even when we're working in</b>
<b>teams.</b>

13:20.767 --> 13:22.703
<b>- They're gonna [bleep]</b>
<b>you over so quick.</b>

13:28.501 --> 13:29.901
<b>- Today, we're testing</b>
<b>precision,</b>

13:29.902 --> 13:31.903
<b>sculpting out of sand.</b>

13:31.904 --> 13:33.538
<b>- You know, we say it all the</b>
<b>time, if you're a good artist,</b>

13:33.539 --> 13:34.973
<b>you can make art out of</b>
<b>anything.</b>

13:34.974 --> 13:37.342
<b>Seeing the people that</b>
<b>approached it with energy...</b>

13:37.343 --> 13:40.211
<b>like, you look at Dave...</b>
<b>it shows against</b>

13:40.212 --> 13:41.679
<b> <i>the majority of the field.</i> </b>

13:41.680 --> 13:44.048
<b> <i>- He went in and outside of the</i> </b>
<b> <i>boundaries and added</i> </b>

13:44.049 --> 13:47.952
<b>on more sand and just made that</b>
<b>snake flow really nice.</b>

13:47.953 --> 13:49.654
<b> <i>- Ryan was the only artist</i> </b>
<b> <i>today able</i> </b>

13:49.655 --> 13:51.356
<b> <i>to achieve different tones.</i> </b>

13:51.357 --> 13:53.958
<b> <i>- The details of the cross and</i> </b>
<b> <i>the skull on the tombstone,</i> </b>

13:53.959 --> 13:55.827
<b>the different colors of clay,</b>
<b>gives her an element</b>

13:55.828 --> 13:58.730
<b>that nobody else was able to</b>
<b>achieve.</b>

13:58.731 --> 14:01.199
<b>- Let's talk about Geary,</b>
<b>who did the cathedral.</b>

14:01.200 --> 14:04.068
<b> <i>- I think he showed precision</i> </b>
<b> <i>nicely by the way he</i> </b>

14:04.069 --> 14:06.171
<b> <i>carved out the equidistant</i> </b>
<b> <i>sides.</i> </b>

14:06.172 --> 14:08.506
<b>- And being able to utilize</b>
<b>symmetry is,</b>

14:08.507 --> 14:11.009
<b>in itself, precision.</b>

14:11.010 --> 14:12.343
<b>We have a decision?</b>
<b>- Let's do it.</b>

14:12.344 --> 14:13.845
<b>- Let's do it, man.</b>

14:13.846 --> 14:15.346
<b>All right, guys.</b>

14:15.347 --> 14:17.115
<b>Corona believes that,</b>
<b>wherever you are,</b>

14:17.116 --> 14:18.683
<b>you can find your beach.</b>

14:18.684 --> 14:22.420
<b>The judges have decided that the</b>
<b>winner of today's</b>

14:22.421 --> 14:27.325
<b>flash challenge is Dave.</b>

14:27.326 --> 14:28.326
<b>- Good job, buddy.</b>

14:28.327 --> 14:29.761
<b>- Thanks, guys.</b>

14:29.762 --> 14:31.629
<b> <i>- One of the nicest</i> </b>
<b> <i>compositions of the day,</i> </b>

14:31.630 --> 14:34.399
<b> <i>and just... the details in the</i> </b>
<b> <i>snake were over the top, man.</i> </b>

14:34.400 --> 14:36.768
<b>Solid work.</b> <b>Great job.</b>

14:36.769 --> 14:38.803
<b>- That means you'll have the</b>
<b>power to assign</b>

14:38.804 --> 14:43.341
<b>the human canvases in your first</b>
<b>elimination tattoo.</b>

14:43.342 --> 14:47.011
<b>- After all his huffing and</b>
<b>puffing and throwing [bleep]</b>

14:47.012 --> 14:51.950
<b>shovels around, Robinowitz wins</b>
<b>the flash challenge.</b>

14:51.951 --> 14:55.787
<b>There's no way of knowing what</b>
<b>that dude is thinking.</b>

14:55.788 --> 14:57.189
<b>- Head on back to the loft.</b>

15:03.662 --> 15:06.231
<b>- I'm really nervous about Dave</b>
<b>and the skull pick.</b>

15:06.232 --> 15:08.199
<b>That guy is so unpredictable.</b>

15:08.200 --> 15:12.403
<b>- We also don't know who Dave</b>
<b>sees as a potential threat.</b>

15:12.404 --> 15:15.073
<b>- He's definitely the least I</b>
<b>trust on the team.</b>

15:15.074 --> 15:16.374
<b>- Nobody's safe.</b>

15:16.375 --> 15:19.577
<b>- I think he has some sort of</b>
<b>crazy plan.</b>

15:19.578 --> 15:23.748
<b>- It dawned on me that, really,</b>
<b>it's you against your own team.</b>

15:23.749 --> 15:27.318
<b>So I've decided that I'm</b>
<b>basically against my team.</b>

15:27.319 --> 15:28.987
<b>- So you're coming to us for</b>
<b>advice?</b>

15:28.988 --> 15:30.088
<b>- Right.</b>

15:30.089 --> 15:32.223
<b>You know,</b>
<b>certain people talk over me,</b>

15:32.224 --> 15:33.958
<b>and that bothers me when people</b>
<b>do that,</b>

15:33.959 --> 15:35.660
<b>and I feel underestimated,</b>

15:35.661 --> 15:37.061
<b>and then other people</b>

15:37.062 --> 15:40.031
<b>just have to be talking all the</b>
<b>time, and they annoy me.</b>

15:40.032 --> 15:42.333
<b>- As long as you have the skull</b>
<b>pick, you need to</b>

15:42.334 --> 15:45.770
<b>make sure that you get the</b>
<b>easiest [bleep] canvas possible.</b>

15:45.771 --> 15:48.606
<b>If you're good enough, that's</b>
<b>gonna take you further enough.</b>

15:48.607 --> 15:51.476
<b>Just don't be that asshole,</b>
<b>like,</b>

15:51.477 --> 15:52.977
<b>because it's gonna</b>
<b>come back to you.</b>

15:52.978 --> 15:54.779
<b>If they see you being an</b>
<b>asshole, they're gonna [bleep]</b>

15:54.780 --> 15:56.348
<b>you over so quick.</b>

15:58.083 --> 16:01.085
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

16:01.086 --> 16:07.526
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

16:09.094 --> 16:12.998
<b>- Team Peck, welcome to your</b>
<b>first elimination tattoo.</b>

16:15.234 --> 16:17.535
<b>Team Nuñez,</b>
<b>you're safe from elimination</b>

16:17.536 --> 16:20.038
<b>and will form the jury of peers.</b>

16:20.039 --> 16:25.210
<b>In the end, only one artist will</b>
<b>win $100,000,</b>

16:25.211 --> 16:29.013
<b>a feature in "Inked" magazine,</b>
<b>and the title of Ink Master.</b>

16:29.014 --> 16:31.749
<b>As for the judges,</b>
<b>it's personal,</b>

16:31.750 --> 16:34.519
<b>because you're also competing</b>
<b>for a guest spot</b>

16:34.520 --> 16:37.622
<b>in either Chris's shop</b>
<b>or Oliver's.</b>

16:37.623 --> 16:39.524
<b>All right, Team Peck, you ready?</b>

16:39.525 --> 16:40.692
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

16:40.693 --> 16:44.996
<b>- Today you must tattoo</b>
<b>a peacock.</b>

16:44.997 --> 16:47.665
<b>- Oh.</b>

16:47.666 --> 16:50.335
<b>- So many colors and textures to</b>
<b>capture...</b>

16:50.336 --> 16:53.438
<b>precision is essential,</b>
<b>or your peacock will go</b>

16:53.439 --> 16:55.473
<b>from bold to blur.</b>

16:55.474 --> 16:57.709
<b> <i>- Peacocks are so challenging.</i> </b>

16:57.710 --> 17:00.779
<b>There's thousands of feathers,</b>
<b>a million little lines,</b>

17:00.780 --> 17:03.448
<b> <i>multiple layers of texture.</i> </b>

17:03.449 --> 17:06.217
<b>You can easily screw up.</b>

17:06.218 --> 17:07.520
<b>- Let's meet your canvases.</b>

17:14.460 --> 17:16.361
<b>Dave, you won the flash</b>
<b>challenge.</b>

17:16.362 --> 17:20.098
<b>That means you now have the</b>
<b>power to assign the canvases.</b>

17:20.098 --> 17:23.902
<b>You are on a team, but this is</b>
<b>your chance to stand apart.</b>

17:23.903 --> 17:25.869
<b>Take it.</b>

17:25.871 --> 17:28.039
<b> <i>- There's a lot of really great</i> </b>
<b> <i>artists on my team,</i> </b>

17:28.040 --> 17:30.642
<b>and if I can get any advantage</b>
<b>over them,</b>

17:30.643 --> 17:32.510
<b>I have to take it.</b>

17:32.511 --> 17:35.447
<b>- I want a hyper-realistic</b>
<b>peacock coming down</b>

17:35.448 --> 17:38.616
<b>from my chest down</b>
<b>to my sleeve arm.</b>

17:38.617 --> 17:40.318
<b>- Are you flexible at all?</b>

17:40.319 --> 17:42.187
<b>- The placement's not changing.</b>

17:42.188 --> 17:45.657
<b>- My strategy is to take out the</b>
<b>stronger artists.</b>

17:45.658 --> 17:46.991
<b>Where do you want to get your</b>
<b>peacock?</b>

17:46.992 --> 17:48.359
<b>- Starting at my ribs,</b>
<b>going down to my hip.</b>

17:48.360 --> 17:50.061
<b>- No.</b>

17:50.062 --> 17:52.397
<b>- Okay, and you know that's a</b>
<b>big tattoo on your ribs, and...</b>

17:52.398 --> 17:54.899
<b>- I have five kids,</b>
<b>so I'm good with pain.</b>

17:54.900 --> 17:57.836
<b>- A peacock on your ribs...</b>
<b>that is a lot of trauma</b>

17:57.837 --> 17:59.104
<b> <i>and a lot of pain.</i> </b>

17:59.105 --> 18:01.339
<b> <i>No way in hell</i> </b>
<b> <i>am I doing this canvas.</i> </b>

18:01.340 --> 18:02.607
<b>- What style do you want to get?</b>

18:02.608 --> 18:04.776
<b>- A realistic peacock with</b>
<b>flames and snowflake</b>

18:04.777 --> 18:07.245
<b>in the tail</b>
<b>and gears in the body.</b>

18:07.246 --> 18:08.580
<b>- What?</b>

18:08.581 --> 18:11.349
<b>- Are you maybe open to just</b>
<b>getting a peacock?</b>

18:11.350 --> 18:12.851
<b>- Not really.</b>

18:12.852 --> 18:15.220
<b>- So far I don't want any of</b>
<b>these canvases.</b>

18:15.221 --> 18:16.988
<b> <i>All of these ideas seem absurd,</i> </b>

18:16.989 --> 18:19.591
<b>and they're all</b>
<b>unwilling to budge.</b>

18:19.592 --> 18:23.695
<b>- I want a color-realistic</b>
<b>peacock going down my ribcage,</b>

18:23.696 --> 18:26.898
<b>and I want the tail to go down</b>
<b>my hip on my butt cheek</b>

18:26.899 --> 18:28.967
<b>and to the front of my thigh.</b>

18:28.968 --> 18:31.503
<b>- What the [bleep]?</b>

18:31.504 --> 18:34.372
<b>- Maybe you should think about</b>
<b>going smaller.</b>

18:34.373 --> 18:36.307
<b>- If you want to be Ink Master,</b>
<b>you got to do it.</b>

18:36.308 --> 18:38.710
<b>- Oh.</b>

18:38.711 --> 18:41.546
<b>- This girl is [bleep] nuts.</b>

18:41.547 --> 18:44.482
<b> <i>Whoever gets this canvas is</i> </b>
<b> <i>screwed.</i> </b>

18:44.483 --> 18:47.318
<b>I got no idea how Dave's gonna</b>
<b>use this skull pick.</b>

18:47.319 --> 18:49.088
<b>I just hope he doesn't</b>
<b>shoot at me.</b>

18:52.091 --> 18:54.926
<b>- Canvases, one by one,</b>
<b>please read the artist's name</b>

18:54.927 --> 18:56.528
<b>on the bottom of the skull.</b>

18:56.529 --> 18:57.595
<b>- Geary.</b>

18:57.596 --> 18:58.998
<b>- Boneface.</b>

19:03.636 --> 19:05.203
<b>- Ryan.</b>

19:05.204 --> 19:08.973
<b>- Are you kidding me?</b>

19:08.974 --> 19:11.209
<b>Dave [bleep] me right now.</b>

19:11.210 --> 19:12.544
<b>- Nate.</b>

19:12.545 --> 19:13.712
<b>- Dave.</b>

19:17.082 --> 19:19.350
<b>- Gia.</b>

19:19.351 --> 19:21.352
<b>- Oh, no.</b>

19:21.353 --> 19:25.023
<b>- Dave is clearly threatened by</b>
<b>the women in this competition.</b>

19:25.024 --> 19:27.025
<b>- You're welcome.</b>

19:27.026 --> 19:29.194
<b>- He's not gonna</b>
<b>come out on top.</b>

19:29.195 --> 19:30.862
<b>- Mike.</b>

19:30.863 --> 19:33.298
<b>- Gian.</b>

19:33.299 --> 19:34.866
<b>- Matt.</b>

19:34.867 --> 19:36.334
<b>- All right, Team Peck.</b>

19:36.335 --> 19:40.538
<b>You will have six hours to</b>
<b>tattoo a precise peacock.</b>

19:40.539 --> 19:43.074
<b>Based on your work,</b>
<b>one of you will be</b>

19:43.075 --> 19:47.145
<b>the first artist on your team</b>
<b>to close shop.</b>

19:47.146 --> 19:49.514
<b>Good luck to you.</b>

19:49.515 --> 19:50.515
<b>- Mike.</b>
<b>- How are you?</b>

19:50.516 --> 19:51.983
<b>- Come over here.</b>

19:51.984 --> 19:53.051
<b>- I'm stoked that you're into</b>
<b>the color stuff, man.</b>

19:53.052 --> 19:54.352
<b>That's totally what I do.</b>

19:54.353 --> 19:55.553
<b>- This is my team's first</b>
<b>elimination.</b>

19:55.554 --> 19:56.721
<b>- I don't want to go too big.</b>

19:56.722 --> 19:58.022
<b>I don't want to go too small.</b>

19:58.023 --> 19:59.124
<b>I want to make it just right.</b>

19:59.125 --> 20:00.225
<b> <i>- You've got the clock ticking.</i> </b>

20:00.226 --> 20:01.726
<b> <i>Somebody's going home.</i> </b>

20:01.727 --> 20:04.429
<b>This is the point when it's time</b>
<b>to do a great tattoo.</b>

20:04.430 --> 20:05.530
<b>- Something that's really</b>
<b>straight,</b>

20:05.531 --> 20:07.031
<b>something that's really nice...</b>

20:07.032 --> 20:08.633
<b> <i>- This is the point where the</i> </b>
<b> <i>light bulb goes off</i> </b>

20:08.634 --> 20:10.468
<b> <i>in everybody's head and they're</i> </b>
<b> <i>like, "Oh, [bleep].</i> </b>"

20:10.469 --> 20:13.538
<b>This competition is a lot harder</b>
<b>than I thought it was."</b>

20:13.539 --> 20:15.807
<b>- I'm gonna start looking up</b>
<b>some reference really quick,</b>

20:15.808 --> 20:18.710
<b>and we're gonna get an idea of</b>
<b>what you like,</b>

20:18.711 --> 20:21.446
<b>color-wise, style-wise,</b>
<b>design-wise.</b>

20:21.447 --> 20:23.014
<b>- The colors that I want...</b>
<b>I want it kind of to be, like,</b>

20:23.015 --> 20:25.283
<b>in phoenix colors, like oranges</b>
<b>and, like, burnt...</b>

20:25.284 --> 20:28.520
<b>you know, burnt oranges and reds</b>
<b>and purples and stuff like that.</b>

20:28.521 --> 20:30.288
<b>- I am a black-and-gray artist.</b>

20:30.289 --> 20:34.692
<b>Precision in color is not one of</b>
<b>my strong points.</b>

20:34.693 --> 20:37.595
<b>We don't want it to look too</b>
<b>close to a phoenix.</b>

20:37.596 --> 20:39.197
<b>- But I do want the colors,</b>
<b>the oranges</b>

20:39.198 --> 20:40.298
<b>and the reds and the purples.</b>

20:40.299 --> 20:41.299
<b>- You want, like, burnt colors?</b>

20:41.300 --> 20:42.300
<b>- Yes, yes.</b>

20:42.301 --> 20:43.868
<b>- Got it.</b>

20:43.869 --> 20:45.937
<b>- So you want it starting on the</b>
<b>top of your ribs</b>

20:45.938 --> 20:47.839
<b>and kind of going down your hip</b>
<b>and then</b>

20:47.840 --> 20:49.474
<b>a little bit fanning</b>
<b>onto the butt?</b>

20:49.475 --> 20:51.910
<b>- Onto the butt... like, the tail</b>
<b>going onto the butt...</b>

20:51.911 --> 20:53.144
<b>- Right, so kind of...</b>

20:53.145 --> 20:54.212
<b>- And then to</b>
<b>the front of the thigh.</b>

20:54.213 --> 20:55.346
<b>- So in the time frame</b>
<b>that we have,</b>

20:55.347 --> 20:56.681
<b>if we start higher up</b>
<b>on your ribs,</b>

20:56.682 --> 20:58.316
<b>you're only gonna get</b>
<b>down to here.</b>

20:58.317 --> 21:00.852
<b>- The only thing I really care</b>
<b>about is the location</b>

21:00.853 --> 21:02.854
<b>and the size and then, like,</b>
<b>the color scheme,</b>

21:02.855 --> 21:04.789
<b>as well as</b>
<b>the realism of the head.</b>

21:04.790 --> 21:07.058
<b>- What she's asking for is</b>
<b>legitimately,</b>

21:07.059 --> 21:08.660
<b>like, a 30-hour tattoo.</b>

21:08.661 --> 21:10.462
<b>- I wanted it to kind of go,</b>
<b>like, here,</b>

21:10.463 --> 21:12.964
<b>and the head go down the body to</b>
<b>about here,</b>

21:12.965 --> 21:14.966
<b>and then the tail go like that.</b>

21:14.967 --> 21:15.968
<b>- I'm screwed.</b>

21:22.052 --> 21:25.421
<b>- You gave both of us the</b>
<b>hardest pieces to do.</b>

21:25.422 --> 21:27.356
<b>- I was put in a [bleep]</b>
<b>situation,</b>

21:27.357 --> 21:29.392
<b>and I admit that I didn't do</b>
<b>that well.</b>

21:29.393 --> 21:32.895
<b>- Don't say that you weren't</b>
<b>going after stronger artists,</b>

21:32.896 --> 21:34.497
<b>because that's not true.</b>

21:34.498 --> 21:36.132
<b>- That was [bleep] up.</b>

21:36.133 --> 21:39.435
<b>- I think there's a lot of,</b>
<b>like, butthurt-ness going on.</b>

21:39.436 --> 21:40.903
<b>- I think she</b>
<b>got the hardest one.</b>

21:40.904 --> 21:42.004
<b>- Nobody's stupid.</b>

21:42.005 --> 21:43.472
<b>Like, we don't... we're not dumb.</b>

21:43.473 --> 21:45.508
<b>- Telling me that you don't</b>
<b>believe me is insulting.</b>

21:45.509 --> 21:47.710
<b>- But you're playing a</b>
<b>completely different game,</b>

21:47.711 --> 21:49.045
<b>even when we're working in</b>
<b>teams,</b>

21:49.046 --> 21:51.547
<b>and that makes me completely not</b>
<b>trust you,</b>

21:51.548 --> 21:52.882
<b>and it's not gonna serve you</b>
<b>well,</b>

21:52.883 --> 21:54.150
<b>because you are a weaker artist.</b>

21:54.151 --> 21:56.019
<b>So just keep that in mind.</b>

22:00.924 --> 22:02.191
<b>- Okay, Team Peck.</b>

22:02.192 --> 22:05.528
<b>You have six hours</b>
<b>to tattoo a peacock.</b>

22:05.529 --> 22:08.364
<b>This is your first chance to</b>
<b>prove to Oliver</b>

22:08.365 --> 22:14.270
<b>that you belong on his team,</b>
<b>and your time starts now.</b>

22:14.271 --> 22:16.606
<b>- All right, let's go.</b>

22:16.607 --> 22:20.076
<b>- Peacocks are very ornate,</b>
<b>very detailed creatures.</b>

22:20.077 --> 22:23.479
<b> <i>It's gonna take precision with</i> </b>
<b> <i>your line work and precision</i> </b>

22:23.480 --> 22:27.049
<b>with your color to really make</b>
<b>these tattoos come to life.</b>

22:27.050 --> 22:28.317
<b>- Okay.</b> <b>Ready?</b>

22:28.318 --> 22:31.988
<b>- Let's do this.</b>

22:31.989 --> 22:34.824
<b>- So the way it's gonna sit on</b>
<b>your body is kind of like this.</b>

22:34.825 --> 22:36.292
<b>That sound good?</b>

22:36.293 --> 22:38.594
<b>- Yep.</b>
<b>- I have a canvas nightmare.</b>

22:38.595 --> 22:42.331
<b>She wants a full-body peacock</b>
<b>that goes from her ribs</b>

22:42.332 --> 22:45.601
<b>down to her knee,</b>
<b>and unwilling to budge.</b>

22:45.602 --> 22:47.903
<b> <i>If I make it through this,</i> </b>
<b> <i>I'm gonna make Dave</i> </b>

22:47.904 --> 22:49.272
<b> <i>eat that skull pick.</i> </b>

22:49.273 --> 22:51.407
<b>- Let me know if I just got to</b>
<b>cover my cooch a little.</b>

22:51.408 --> 22:52.675
<b>- Okay.</b>

22:52.676 --> 22:55.111
<b>Ugh.</b>

22:55.112 --> 22:56.178
<b>- Hi, Nikki.</b>

22:56.179 --> 22:57.313
<b>How do you think</b>
<b>my skull pick went?</b>

22:57.314 --> 22:58.514
<b>- I was surprised.</b>

22:58.515 --> 22:59.782
<b>I thought it would</b>
<b>go another way.</b>

22:59.783 --> 23:02.752
<b>- Well, hopefully it works out</b>
<b>for me.</b>

23:02.753 --> 23:04.053
<b>- What's going on?</b>

23:04.054 --> 23:05.855
<b>- Just kind of started getting</b>
<b>into this thing.</b>

23:05.856 --> 23:07.623
<b>- That's a big tattoo.</b>

23:07.624 --> 23:09.692
<b> <i>- I have to show precision</i> </b>
<b> <i>working through</i> </b>

23:09.693 --> 23:11.427
<b>a roadmap of stretch marks.</b>

23:11.428 --> 23:13.562
<b> <i>It's hard for me</i> </b>
<b> <i>to pull a clean line.</i> </b>

23:13.563 --> 23:16.065
<b>- I tried to tell her she's</b>
<b>getting tattooed by a legend.</b>

23:16.066 --> 23:17.733
<b>It's amazing.</b>
<b>He can do anything.</b>

23:17.734 --> 23:19.302
<b>- I know, believe me.</b>

23:19.303 --> 23:20.636
<b> <i>- I'm Nate Beavers.</i> </b>

23:20.637 --> 23:22.271
<b> <i>I'm well-known in the</i> </b>
<b> <i>tattoo world.</i> </b>

23:22.272 --> 23:24.573
<b> <i>If I get canned right now,</i> </b>
<b> <i>that's gonna look real bad.</i> </b>

23:24.574 --> 23:27.376
<b>My only saving grace is that</b>
<b>somebody else is doing</b>

23:27.377 --> 23:29.579
<b>something that is worse than</b>
<b>what I'm doing right now.</b>

23:32.115 --> 23:33.950
<b>- I think it's laid out okay.</b>

23:33.951 --> 23:37.286
<b>- It looks like only one of the</b>
<b>talons is going over the branch.</b>

23:37.287 --> 23:38.654
<b>What is happening with that?</b>

23:38.655 --> 23:42.291
<b>These two are just like this on</b>
<b>the branch.</b>

23:42.292 --> 23:43.492
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

23:43.493 --> 23:44.694
<b>All right,</b>
<b>think I should redraw it?</b>

23:44.695 --> 23:46.162
<b>- Yeah, I think you should</b>
<b>have those</b>

23:46.163 --> 23:47.863
<b>other talons going over that.</b>

23:47.864 --> 23:48.998
<b>- Cool.</b>

23:48.999 --> 23:50.033
<b>We'll do that.</b>

23:53.937 --> 23:56.305
<b>- I don't know what happened</b>
<b>with Geary's customer.</b>

23:56.306 --> 23:58.007
<b> <i>He asked for hyper-realism.</i> </b>

23:58.008 --> 24:01.377
<b>- My canvas originally wanted a</b>
<b>hyper-realistic peacock,</b>

24:01.378 --> 24:03.780
<b> <i>but I talked him into doing a</i> </b>
<b> <i>traditional tattoo.</i> </b>

24:09.519 --> 24:12.154
<b> <i>I'm still lining it,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and it is going slow.</i> </b>

24:12.155 --> 24:13.923
<b>- How long have you guys</b>
<b>been at it?</b>

24:13.924 --> 24:16.692
<b>- The whole time... they start</b>
<b>shaking, man.</b>

24:16.693 --> 24:18.294
<b>I just can't go fast...</b>

24:18.295 --> 24:20.162
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- And make clean lines.</b>

24:20.163 --> 24:21.964
<b>Lyme disease definitely makes</b>
<b>tattooing</b>

24:21.965 --> 24:24.166
<b>a little bit harder for me.</b>

24:24.167 --> 24:25.901
<b>- I hope he can finish.</b>

24:25.902 --> 24:27.470
<b>- He needs to speed it up.</b>

24:27.471 --> 24:30.673
<b>- Three hours to go... three more</b>
<b>hours, guys.</b>

24:30.674 --> 24:35.044
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

24:35.045 --> 24:36.345
<b>- Don't move.</b>

24:36.346 --> 24:37.346
<b>Thank you.</b>

24:37.347 --> 24:38.481
<b>- Oh, yeah.</b>

24:38.482 --> 24:39.849
<b>That came out pretty</b>
<b>[bleep] cool.</b>

24:39.850 --> 24:41.717
<b>- I changed the gears,</b>
<b>like, 13 times.</b>

24:41.718 --> 24:43.119
<b>- Kind of like it's popping</b>
<b>open?</b>

24:43.120 --> 24:44.520
<b>- Yeah.</b>

24:44.521 --> 24:46.389
<b> <i>It was hard enough just doing a</i> </b>
<b> <i>peacock tattoo,</i> </b>

24:46.390 --> 24:48.491
<b>but I have another challenge,</b>
<b>which is making my peacock</b>

24:48.492 --> 24:49.825
<b>look like a [bleep] robot.</b>

24:49.826 --> 24:51.127
<b>If I made these, like,</b>
<b>a little sharper,</b>

24:51.128 --> 24:52.962
<b>then I can make them look more</b>
<b>metallic.</b>

24:52.963 --> 24:54.130
<b>- I dig it, man.</b>

24:54.131 --> 24:55.631
<b> <i>- People underestimate me.</i> </b>

24:55.632 --> 24:57.567
<b> <i>Precision is something that I'm</i> </b>
<b> <i>pretty strong in.</i> </b>

24:59.603 --> 25:00.803
<b>- Oh, yeah.</b>

25:00.804 --> 25:02.271
<b>You're finally getting to work,</b>
<b>bud.</b>

25:02.272 --> 25:04.774
<b> <i>- I'm the only one here that</i> </b>
<b> <i>hasn't tattooed</i> </b>

25:04.775 --> 25:06.609
<b> <i>since I was picked on a team,</i> </b>
<b> <i>so I need to</i> </b>

25:06.610 --> 25:08.544
<b>make my tattoo stand out.</b>

25:08.545 --> 25:11.681
<b> <i>I'm taking a different approach</i> </b>
<b> <i>with a zoomed-in view</i> </b>

25:11.682 --> 25:14.851
<b>so I can get all of the details</b>
<b>in the head and show precision.</b>

25:17.588 --> 25:18.688
<b>- Cruising?</b>

25:18.689 --> 25:20.089
<b>- Yeah.</b> <b>What do you think?</b>

25:20.090 --> 25:22.024
<b>- Smooth, man... smooth, smooth.</b>

25:22.025 --> 25:23.192
<b>Feeling good with time?</b>

25:23.193 --> 25:24.527
<b>- I'm feeling good with time.</b>

25:24.528 --> 25:27.763
<b> <i>My strategy is to</i> </b>
<b> <i>stay under the radar,</i> </b>

25:27.764 --> 25:32.001
<b>make sure I do clean stuff, and</b>
<b>just ride it as long as I can.</b>

25:32.002 --> 25:34.070
<b>- With it being precision,</b>
<b>you don't want to compromise</b>

25:34.071 --> 25:36.339
<b>your ability to get everything</b>
<b>super-clean</b>

25:36.340 --> 25:38.040
<b>'cause you're worried about</b>
<b>going too big.</b>

25:38.041 --> 25:39.375
<b> <i>- And if Olly's giving me</i> </b>
<b> <i>advice,</i> </b>

25:39.376 --> 25:41.077
<b> <i>I'm gonna listen</i> </b>
<b> <i>to every bit of it.</i> </b>

25:41.078 --> 25:43.279
<b>I want to be the last one</b>
<b>standing in this competition.</b>

25:43.280 --> 25:47.717
<b>- This is your last hour</b>
<b>remaining, guys... one more hour.</b>

25:47.718 --> 25:49.485
<b>- I'm definitely gonna run out</b>
<b>of time,</b>

25:49.486 --> 25:50.886
<b>so I have to shorten it</b>
<b>a little bit.</b>

25:50.887 --> 25:52.588
<b>There's no time</b>
<b>to finish the tail,</b>

25:52.589 --> 25:58.628
<b>so I wipe off 50% of my stencil,</b>
<b>freehand some [bleep] on,</b>

25:58.629 --> 26:00.363
<b>and start over.</b>

26:00.364 --> 26:03.232
<b>Plan B... I'd rather simplify</b>
<b>something last-minute</b>

26:03.233 --> 26:05.868
<b>than try to rush and half-ass.</b>

26:05.869 --> 26:09.972
<b> <i>Dave gave the only two</i> </b>
<b> <i>rib-to-knee tattoos</i> </b>

26:09.973 --> 26:12.508
<b>to the only two girls</b>
<b>on the team.</b>

26:12.509 --> 26:14.510
<b> <i>I don't know if it's because</i> </b>
<b> <i>we're strong players</i> </b>

26:14.511 --> 26:16.612
<b> <i>or if it's just because we're</i> </b>
<b> <i>girls.</i> </b>

26:16.613 --> 26:17.914
<b>- I know it's hard.</b>

26:17.915 --> 26:19.348
<b>Just breathe through it.</b>

26:19.349 --> 26:22.051
<b>You only have, like, two or</b>
<b>three more back here.</b>

26:22.052 --> 26:23.819
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

26:23.820 --> 26:26.622
<b>- Five, four, three,</b>

26:26.623 --> 26:29.292
<b>two, one... that's it.</b>

26:29.293 --> 26:30.326
<b>Machines down.</b>

26:30.327 --> 26:31.327
<b>Time is up.</b>

26:31.328 --> 26:32.628
<b>No more ink.</b>

26:32.629 --> 26:33.629
<b>- Just lay there, okay?</b>

26:33.630 --> 26:35.331
<b>- Okay.</b>

26:35.332 --> 26:37.099
<b>- Hey.</b> <b>Really dig it.</b>

26:37.100 --> 26:38.868
<b> <i>- It's not my fault</i> </b>
<b> <i>that Gia wasn't able</i> </b>

26:38.869 --> 26:40.503
<b> <i>to scale down her tattoo.</i> </b>

26:40.504 --> 26:43.973
<b>It's not my fault that Ryan put</b>
<b>a lot of detail in hers.</b>

26:43.974 --> 26:45.074
<b>- What do you think?</b>

26:45.075 --> 26:46.309
<b>- So pretty.</b>
<b>- Yay.</b>

26:46.310 --> 26:47.743
<b>- Oh, my gosh, I love it.</b>

26:47.744 --> 26:49.378
<b> <i>- I gave them difficult</i> </b>
<b> <i>canvases because I thought</i> </b>

26:49.379 --> 26:50.480
<b>they could handle it.</b>

26:52.950 --> 26:54.517
<b>- You're not being a team</b>
<b>player.</b>

26:54.518 --> 26:56.519
<b>- It is what it is.</b>
<b>- Really, mother[bleep]?</b>

26:56.520 --> 26:58.220
<b>- Get over it.</b>
<b>- I'm on your [bleep] team.</b>

26:58.221 --> 27:00.323
<b>- It's precision day.</b>
<b>- It is rough.</b>

27:00.324 --> 27:01.357
<b>- I freaked out.</b>

27:01.358 --> 27:02.925
<b>- It's stiff... very strange.</b>

27:02.926 --> 27:03.926
<b>- I'm not delusional.</b>

27:03.927 --> 27:04.927
<b>- It sucks.</b>

27:04.928 --> 27:05.928
<b>- I'm finished, man.</b>

27:05.929 --> 27:07.230
<b>- Guess who's packing?</b>

27:13.396 --> 27:15.697
<b>- Today, you were on Team Nuñez,</b>
<b>buddy.</b>

27:15.698 --> 27:17.199
<b>- That tattoo was impossible.</b>

27:17.200 --> 27:19.167
<b>- I know that it was difficult,</b>
<b>but I didn't think</b>

27:19.168 --> 27:20.502
<b>it was the most difficult</b>
<b>canvas.</b>

27:20.503 --> 27:21.770
<b>- Really, mother[bleep]?</b>

27:21.771 --> 27:24.373
<b>- The whole room reacted.</b>

27:24.374 --> 27:25.407
<b>- It is what it is.</b>

27:25.408 --> 27:27.242
<b>- Just be [bleep] real, man.</b>

27:27.243 --> 27:29.077
<b>- You are not owning up to</b>
<b>whatever it is</b>

27:29.078 --> 27:31.680
<b>that you're doing, and you're</b>
<b>not being a team player.</b>

27:31.681 --> 27:33.248
<b>- You're saying</b>
<b>that I'm playing dirty,</b>

27:33.249 --> 27:36.151
<b>that I maliciously gave you guys</b>
<b>hard pieces.</b>

27:36.152 --> 27:38.887
<b>- We don't care why you gave</b>
<b>anyone what canvas.</b>

27:38.888 --> 27:41.523
<b>What we care about is you being</b>
<b>dishonest about it.</b>

27:41.524 --> 27:43.025
<b>- Look, I thought you were</b>
<b>strong enough to do</b>

27:43.026 --> 27:44.593
<b>that tattoo without whining</b>
<b>about it.</b>

27:44.594 --> 27:45.794
<b>You need to get over it.</b>

27:45.795 --> 27:47.295
<b>- I have not been</b>
<b>whining about it.</b>

27:47.296 --> 27:48.530
<b>I'm pissed.</b>

27:48.531 --> 27:50.132
<b>You put me in a compromising</b>
<b>situation,</b>

27:50.133 --> 27:51.567
<b>and I'm on your [bleep] team.</b>

28:05.048 --> 28:07.516
<b>- Team Peck, today,</b>
<b>you had to show precision</b>

28:07.517 --> 28:09.351
<b>by tattooing a peacock.</b>

28:09.352 --> 28:13.088
<b>Team Nuñez, you will serve as</b>
<b>the jury of peers.</b>

28:13.089 --> 28:15.925
<b>Our first artist up today</b>
<b>is Dave.</b>

28:19.228 --> 28:21.463
<b>- The overall feel of this</b>
<b>tattoo is a little bit muted.</b>

28:21.464 --> 28:23.765
<b>Very little use of bright</b>
<b>color... the color play</b>

28:23.766 --> 28:26.134
<b>at the bottom is interesting,</b>
<b>but it does come off</b>

28:26.135 --> 28:27.502
<b> <i>as a camouflage feel.</i> </b>

28:27.503 --> 28:29.471
<b>- Well, in nature, that's what</b>
<b>the tails</b>

28:29.472 --> 28:30.939
<b>are meant for on a peacock.</b>

28:30.940 --> 28:32.808
<b>The display throws off the</b>
<b>predators.</b>

28:32.809 --> 28:34.943
<b>So it has that camouflage look.</b>

28:34.944 --> 28:36.945
<b>- It's almost like there are two</b>
<b>different thoughts,</b>

28:36.946 --> 28:39.414
<b> <i>like a pigeon or a dove sitting</i> </b>
<b> <i>on a branch,</i> </b>

28:39.415 --> 28:42.952
<b>and the feathers could read like</b>
<b>leaves or foliage.</b>

28:44.954 --> 28:48.223
<b>Gian.</b>

28:48.224 --> 28:52.394
<b>- You did a really crisp, really</b>
<b>clean, really beautiful tattoo.</b>

28:52.395 --> 28:55.097
<b> <i>You made those little puffy</i> </b>
<b> <i>areas in the neck,</i> </b>

28:55.098 --> 28:57.132
<b> <i>and then when you dropped down</i> </b>
<b> <i>to the actual tail feathers,</i> </b>

28:57.133 --> 28:58.633
<b> <i>you outlined them the same way.</i> </b>

28:58.634 --> 29:00.969
<b>In a stylized world,</b>
<b>it's a much closer take</b>

29:00.970 --> 29:02.504
<b>on a peacock feather.</b>

29:02.505 --> 29:04.740
<b> <i>The flower/mandala...</i> </b>
<b> <i>you executed each</i> </b>

29:04.741 --> 29:06.074
<b> <i>little section beautifully.</i> </b>

29:06.075 --> 29:07.709
<b>As far as precision,</b>
<b>this is what an outline</b>

29:07.710 --> 29:09.144
<b> <i>has to look like.</i> </b>

29:09.145 --> 29:10.612
<b>This is what the color has to</b>
<b>look like.</b>

29:10.613 --> 29:12.493
<b> <i>Hopefully some people behind</i> </b>
<b> <i>you learn from you.</i> </b>

29:15.184 --> 29:18.186
<b>- Nate.</b>

29:18.187 --> 29:21.723
<b>- The actual drawing is really</b>
<b>stiff.</b>

29:21.724 --> 29:23.925
<b>The area of the back where the</b>
<b>tail is,</b>

29:23.926 --> 29:25.660
<b>it doesn't have that soft</b>
<b>peacock feel.</b>

29:25.661 --> 29:28.630
<b>It has more of a hard wood</b>
<b>grain... gives it an acorn feel.</b>

29:28.631 --> 29:31.299
<b> <i>- And the way you did those</i> </b>
<b> <i>ridges in the body</i> </b>

29:31.300 --> 29:33.235
<b> <i>of the peacock gave it that</i> </b>
<b> <i>lumpiness.</i> </b>

29:33.236 --> 29:34.369
<b> <i>It's very strange.</i> </b>

29:34.370 --> 29:37.839
<b>This tattoo's not a winner.</b>

29:37.840 --> 29:41.009
<b>- Matt.</b>

29:41.010 --> 29:43.478
<b>- From a distance, this tattoo</b>
<b>has a nice flow to it.</b>

29:43.479 --> 29:45.080
<b> <i>I like the shade, the design.</i> </b>

29:45.081 --> 29:46.615
<b> <i>I like the way</i> </b>
<b> <i>it sits on the body.</i> </b>

29:46.616 --> 29:49.017
<b> <i>I like the nice, long, flowing</i> </b>
<b> <i>peacock feathers,</i> </b>

29:49.018 --> 29:52.254
<b> <i>and it does have this Tin Man</i> </b>
<b> <i>kind of feel, riveted together.</i> </b>

29:52.255 --> 29:53.688
<b>- My critique's totally</b>
<b>different.</b>

29:53.689 --> 29:55.390
<b>I don't like it.</b>

29:55.391 --> 29:58.427
<b>It's precision day, so let's</b>
<b>start on the winding key up top.</b>

29:58.428 --> 30:00.996
<b> <i>That key has no precision to it</i> </b>
<b> <i>whatsoever.</i> </b>

30:00.997 --> 30:02.464
<b> <i>The two circles don't match.</i> </b>

30:02.465 --> 30:05.133
<b> <i>Then you made all these crazy</i> </b>
<b> <i>patterns in the wings.</i> </b>

30:05.134 --> 30:10.338
<b>Nothing about that that needs to</b>
<b>be precise is precise.</b>

30:10.339 --> 30:14.076
<b>- Ryan.</b>

30:14.077 --> 30:16.945
<b>- This tattoo, for me, is a</b>
<b>big-time bummer.</b>

30:16.946 --> 30:21.383
<b>Any area that you zoom in on</b>
<b>this tattoo, you find problems.</b>

30:21.384 --> 30:23.485
<b> <i>There's areas where your color</i> </b>
<b> <i>goes out of the line.</i> </b>

30:23.486 --> 30:25.153
<b> <i>There's areas where things just</i> </b>
<b> <i>aren't</i> </b>

30:25.154 --> 30:26.722
<b> <i>solid, smooth, and clean.</i> </b>

30:26.723 --> 30:28.156
<b> <i>Today being a precision</i> </b>
<b> <i>challenge,</i> </b>

30:28.157 --> 30:30.559
<b>this is the worst day for you to</b>
<b>do this kind of stuff.</b>

30:30.560 --> 30:34.463
<b>- It was just a horrible case of</b>
<b>very poor time management.</b>

30:34.464 --> 30:36.698
<b>- You being one of the top dogs</b>
<b>on your team</b>

30:36.699 --> 30:40.335
<b>to doing this... big decline.</b>

30:40.336 --> 30:43.438
<b>- Boneface.</b>

30:43.439 --> 30:46.475
<b>You chose to go with more of a</b>
<b>zoomed-in view</b>

30:46.476 --> 30:47.976
<b> <i>rather than the whole body.</i> </b>

30:47.977 --> 30:49.945
<b>- I wanted to do something more</b>
<b>dynamic, something bigger</b>

30:49.946 --> 30:51.480
<b>that you could recognize</b>
<b>from a distance.</b>

30:51.481 --> 30:53.482
<b>- The details you get in the</b>
<b>beak, the little textures</b>

30:53.483 --> 30:55.584
<b> <i>you get in the blue feathers on</i> </b>
<b> <i>the crown of the head...</i> </b>

30:55.585 --> 30:56.585
<b> <i>it's really nice, man.</i> </b>

30:56.586 --> 30:58.120
<b>You have tricks up your sleeve.</b>

30:58.121 --> 30:59.621
<b> <i>You're able to put in strong</i> </b>
<b> <i>color.</i> </b>

30:59.622 --> 31:01.656
<b> <i>You're able to put black where</i> </b>
<b> <i>it needs to be</i> </b>

31:01.657 --> 31:03.625
<b> <i>to make the other colors</i> </b>
<b> <i>vibrant and strong.</i> </b>

31:03.626 --> 31:05.294
<b>I am pleasantly surprised.</b>

31:08.464 --> 31:11.566
<b>- Mike.</b>

31:11.567 --> 31:14.569
<b>- Overall, this tattoo has a</b>
<b>very simplistic feel,</b>

31:14.570 --> 31:16.271
<b> <i>but when you go in and look at</i> </b>
<b> <i>any close area,</i> </b>

31:16.272 --> 31:18.573
<b> <i>like the face, the eyes,</i> </b>
<b> <i>the detail of the beak,</i> </b>

31:18.574 --> 31:19.708
<b> <i>it's very nice.</i> </b>

31:19.709 --> 31:20.976
<b>Judging all the tattoos</b>
<b>in the room,</b>

31:20.977 --> 31:22.711
<b>your precision is pretty</b>
<b>on-point.</b>

31:22.712 --> 31:26.048
<b> <i>- Your tattooing is always</i> </b>
<b> <i>clean, always spot-on,</i> </b>

31:26.049 --> 31:28.383
<b> <i>and some of the safest in the</i> </b>
<b> <i>room.</i> </b>

31:28.384 --> 31:30.052
<b>You're gonna need to loosen up</b>
<b>on the safety belt,</b>

31:30.053 --> 31:32.687
<b>because when it comes down to</b>
<b>it, it's your killer tattoo</b>

31:32.688 --> 31:35.424
<b>versus another killer tattoo,</b>
<b>but they did a bunch more.</b>

31:35.425 --> 31:37.345
<b>Bigger risk of your stuff...</b>
<b>guess who's packing.</b>

31:40.396 --> 31:42.931
<b>- Geary.</b>

31:42.932 --> 31:46.768
<b>- Unfinished, man... you should</b>
<b>not have outlined that flame.</b>

31:46.769 --> 31:48.837
<b> <i>You just gave yourself an</i> </b>
<b> <i>eyesore that</i> </b>

31:48.838 --> 31:50.072
<b> <i>didn't even need to be there.</i> </b>

31:50.073 --> 31:51.640
<b>- As I was looking at it,</b>
<b>compositionally,</b>

31:51.641 --> 31:53.308
<b>it was really bottom-heavy.</b>

31:53.309 --> 31:55.744
<b>- It is a pretty stagnant image,</b>
<b>and one of the reasons</b>

31:55.745 --> 31:57.813
<b>I chose you for the team is for</b>
<b>your creativity.</b>

31:57.814 --> 32:02.117
<b>This tattoo doesn't show any of</b>
<b>that.</b>

32:02.118 --> 32:04.953
<b>- Gia.</b>

32:04.954 --> 32:07.889
<b>Your canvas wanted a massive</b>
<b>tattoo.</b>

32:07.890 --> 32:12.094
<b>- I had a nightmare from the</b>
<b>beginning to the end.</b>

32:12.095 --> 32:14.896
<b>- This thing is rough.</b>

32:14.897 --> 32:18.100
<b> <i>It is big, but there's certain</i> </b>
<b> <i>areas that,</i> </b>

32:18.101 --> 32:21.236
<b>in a precision challenge,</b>
<b>is hurting you so bad.</b>

32:21.237 --> 32:22.270
<b>- Where did you start?</b>

32:22.271 --> 32:23.939
<b>- I started with the head.</b>

32:23.940 --> 32:26.441
<b> <i>- That would be the area with</i> </b>
<b> <i>the least amount of mistakes,</i> </b>

32:26.442 --> 32:29.077
<b> <i>because it's where you started,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but there is blue completely</i> </b>

32:29.078 --> 32:32.114
<b> <i>outside the lines on the bottom</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the chin and the neck.</i> </b>

32:32.115 --> 32:35.917
<b>This entire thing is debatably</b>
<b>the worst tattoo of the day.</b>

32:35.918 --> 32:37.819
<b>- I cannot imagine having this</b>
<b>canvas.</b>

32:37.820 --> 32:39.187
<b>- It's a client.</b>
<b>If you want to pay your rent,</b>

32:39.188 --> 32:40.822
<b>you tattoo that [bleep] canvas,</b>
<b>period.</b>

32:40.823 --> 32:42.357
<b>That's how we live.</b>

32:42.358 --> 32:45.527
<b>It sucks to get a bad one,</b>
<b>I get it, but just starting...</b>

32:45.528 --> 32:47.229
<b>if there's not</b>
<b>that first good pull,</b>

32:47.230 --> 32:48.930
<b>that pull was never coming.</b>

32:48.931 --> 32:51.266
<b>- I know she's on the opposite</b>
<b>team, but I have to say</b>

32:51.267 --> 32:53.835
<b>the drawing is more</b>
<b>aesthetically pleasing</b>

32:53.836 --> 32:57.172
<b>than a lot of other people that</b>
<b>did not get reamed as hard.</b>

32:57.173 --> 32:58.573
<b>- It all evens out in the wash.</b>

32:58.574 --> 33:01.209
<b> <i>The one that debatably had the</i> </b>
<b> <i>nicest composition</i> </b>

33:01.210 --> 33:04.347
<b>had debatably the worst possible</b>
<b>technical flaws in it.</b>

33:07.550 --> 33:09.518
<b>- All right, guys.</b>
<b>Best tattoo of the day?</b>

33:09.519 --> 33:12.954
<b>- Just on technical application,</b>
<b>line work, and color,</b>

33:12.955 --> 33:14.623
<b>it's Gian all day, period.</b>

33:14.624 --> 33:16.191
<b> <i>- Yeah, that's exactly where</i> </b>
<b> <i>I'm sitting.</i> </b>

33:16.192 --> 33:18.627
<b> <i>- There's no debate about that.</i> </b>

33:18.628 --> 33:21.063
<b>- The judges have decided that</b>
<b>the best tattoo</b>

33:21.064 --> 33:23.165
<b>of the day goes to Gian.</b>

33:23.166 --> 33:24.366
<b>Congratulations, man.</b>

33:24.367 --> 33:27.469
<b>- Thanks, guys.</b>

33:27.470 --> 33:28.704
<b>- Okay, Team Peck.</b>

33:28.705 --> 33:31.306
<b>One of you is about to pack your</b>
<b>machines.</b>

33:31.307 --> 33:33.676
<b>All of you can head back to the</b>
<b>loft.</b>

33:38.214 --> 33:41.349
<b>- I feel like you guys are the</b>
<b>strongest players.</b>

33:41.350 --> 33:44.486
<b>- Hopefully the judges give us a</b>
<b>little bit of credit</b>

33:44.487 --> 33:46.688
<b>because we were dealt the</b>
<b>[bleep] canvases,</b>

33:46.689 --> 33:49.758
<b>whether Dave is ready to admit</b>
<b>it to the world or not.</b>

33:49.759 --> 33:52.594
<b>- It's way too early, and I'm</b>
<b>not ready to go home.</b>

33:52.595 --> 33:54.663
<b>- Even if we're on opposite</b>
<b>teams, all of us</b>

33:54.664 --> 33:57.599
<b>together are better than any of</b>
<b>those dudes.</b>

33:57.600 --> 33:59.801
<b>- If either Gia or I go home</b>
<b>today,</b>

33:59.802 --> 34:02.571
<b>this alliance has to stay.</b>

34:02.572 --> 34:04.172
<b>- I don't give a damn</b>
<b>about teams</b>

34:04.173 --> 34:05.707
<b>when it comes down to this.</b>

34:05.708 --> 34:08.108
<b>- I think we could definitely be</b>
<b>a force to be reckoned with.</b>

34:15.243 --> 34:17.878
<b>- We're here to discuss what</b>
<b>artists should be</b>

34:17.879 --> 34:19.513
<b>put up for elimination.</b>

34:19.514 --> 34:21.081
<b>- We go to Ryan.</b>

34:21.083 --> 34:23.583
<b>- Beautiful... oh, my gosh,</b>
<b>so beautiful... but no lines.</b>

34:23.585 --> 34:25.018
<b> <i>- And the lines that are there</i> </b>
<b> <i>are wonky.</i> </b>

34:25.020 --> 34:26.053
<b> <i>- Even though it's not finished,</i> </b>

34:26.054 --> 34:27.088
<b> <i>I didn't hate this tattoo.</i> </b>

34:27.089 --> 34:28.489
<b> <i>This isn't in the bottom to me.</i> </b>

34:28.489 --> 34:30.324
<b>- This tattoo, there's...</b>
<b>it could still be more</b>

34:30.324 --> 34:32.626
<b>done to it, as where you have</b>
<b>Gia's tattoo...</b>

34:32.627 --> 34:36.197
<b> <i>she totally went out of the</i> </b>
<b> <i>lines with the shader.</i> </b>

34:36.197 --> 34:38.364
<b>- And that blob of blue on the</b>
<b>ass and the thigh</b>

34:38.366 --> 34:39.699
<b> <i>is not fixable to me.</i> </b>

34:39.701 --> 34:41.302
<b> <i>That [bleep] is dark.</i> </b>

34:41.303 --> 34:45.106
<b>- Can you guys really [bleep]</b>
<b>say that could really be less</b>

34:45.107 --> 34:47.908
<b>than Geary's when it comes to</b>
<b>quality?</b>

34:47.909 --> 34:50.710
<b> <i>- This is not a good tattoo.</i> </b>

34:50.712 --> 34:53.813
<b>He has problems right out of the</b>
<b>gate with the drawing,</b>

34:53.815 --> 34:57.418
<b> <i>but unfortunately he put that</i> </b>
<b> <i>background in.</i> </b>

34:57.419 --> 34:58.986
<b>- That's some first-year</b>
<b>tattooer [bleep].</b>

34:58.987 --> 35:02.156
<b>- If I make it to the end and I</b>
<b>have to go against Geary,</b>

35:02.157 --> 35:05.292
<b>if that's his skill set, I don't</b>
<b>want that [bleep] $100,000.</b>

35:05.293 --> 35:06.727
<b>- You're full of [bleep].</b>

35:06.728 --> 35:08.162
<b>- How am I full of [bleep]?</b>

35:08.163 --> 35:10.865
<b>- Want the $100,000 if I got to</b>
<b>go up against that...</b>

35:10.866 --> 35:14.034
<b>- I would have no dignity in any</b>
<b>part of that [bleep] win.</b>

35:14.035 --> 35:18.539
<b>I want a good competition to go</b>
<b>against.</b>

35:18.540 --> 35:20.441
<b>- All right, guys.</b>
<b>Today, we're testing precision.</b>

35:20.442 --> 35:23.411
<b>Team Peck, you guys are on the</b>
<b>line... peacocks.</b>

35:23.412 --> 35:25.746
<b>- For me, you know, this new</b>
<b>dynamic of having a team,</b>

35:25.747 --> 35:28.449
<b>it's hard to give hard critiques</b>
<b>to the people you're gonna turn</b>

35:28.450 --> 35:30.651
<b>around the next day and try to</b>
<b>embrace.</b>

35:30.652 --> 35:32.920
<b>It is a lot harder to kick</b>
<b>somebody off your own team.</b>

35:32.921 --> 35:34.655
<b>- Who's in the bottom</b>
<b>for you today?</b>

35:34.656 --> 35:36.190
<b>- The biggest bummer</b>
<b>of the day...</b>

35:36.191 --> 35:37.925
<b> <i>you've got Ryan in the bottom.</i> </b>

35:37.926 --> 35:39.727
<b> <i>Tattoo is drastically</i> </b>
<b> <i>under-finished,</i> </b>

35:39.728 --> 35:42.062
<b> <i>and what is there is weak.</i> </b>

35:42.063 --> 35:43.831
<b>- When I look at the face of</b>
<b>this thing,</b>

35:43.832 --> 35:45.699
<b> <i>it looks semi-realistic.</i> </b>

35:45.700 --> 35:47.134
<b> <i>It looks like a bird.</i> </b>

35:47.135 --> 35:49.136
<b>Tell me what's wrong with it on</b>
<b>a precision level.</b>

35:49.137 --> 35:51.405
<b>- The areas that are skin tone</b>
<b>that have a blackout line</b>

35:51.406 --> 35:54.275
<b> <i>around them... those outlines are</i> </b>
<b> <i>scratchy and terrible</i> </b>

35:54.276 --> 35:55.843
<b> <i>and picked up a thousand places.</i> </b>

35:55.844 --> 35:58.846
<b>Nowhere in there does it look</b>
<b>like a solid black outline.</b>

35:58.847 --> 36:01.182
<b>- Let's talk about Geary,</b>
<b>who was having some trouble.</b>

36:01.183 --> 36:03.084
<b> <i>- Grossly under-finished</i> </b> <b> <i>tattoo,</i> </b>

36:03.085 --> 36:04.852
<b> <i>the drawing is terrible.</i> </b>

36:04.853 --> 36:07.188
<b>Overall, this is just a bad</b>
<b>design.</b>

36:07.189 --> 36:09.090
<b>- What Gia did</b>
<b>is pretty crazy too.</b>

36:09.091 --> 36:11.826
<b> <i>- She just rushed too much to</i> </b>
<b> <i>finish too much,</i> </b>

36:11.827 --> 36:13.627
<b>and it's just really,</b>
<b>really sloppy.</b>

36:13.628 --> 36:16.864
<b>- The actual decision-making of</b>
<b>where the ink</b>

36:16.865 --> 36:18.632
<b> <i>went on the person's body...</i> </b>

36:18.633 --> 36:20.201
<b>- Out of control.</b>

36:20.202 --> 36:23.504
<b>- Well, it sounds like we are</b>
<b>unified on a decision, correct?</b>

36:23.505 --> 36:24.538
<b>You want to let 'em know?</b>

36:24.539 --> 36:25.640
<b>- Yeah.</b>

36:27.109 --> 36:30.311
<b>- Oh, I'm, like,</b>
<b>sick to my stomach.</b>

36:30.312 --> 36:31.512
<b>- I don't know.</b>

36:31.513 --> 36:33.214
<b>I thought we were working</b>
<b>as a team,</b>

36:33.215 --> 36:35.416
<b>but then some people aren't</b>
<b>working as a team,</b>

36:35.417 --> 36:37.318
<b>and then is it about team</b>
<b>values?</b>

36:37.319 --> 36:39.287
<b>I mean, I have no idea what to</b>
<b>expect.</b>

36:47.696 --> 36:49.998
<b>- Jury of peers, who are you</b>
<b>putting up for elimination?</b>

36:53.468 --> 36:56.137
<b>- All right, we've all decided.</b>

36:56.138 --> 36:59.407
<b>We're gonna put Geary up for</b>
<b>elimination.</b>

36:59.408 --> 37:01.142
<b>- Judges are gonna see Geary,</b>

37:01.143 --> 37:05.312
<b>Ryan, and Gia.</b>

37:05.313 --> 37:08.349
<b>See y'all and the jury of peers</b>
<b>downstairs.</b>

37:08.350 --> 37:09.917
<b>- I don't feel safe.</b>

37:09.918 --> 37:10.985
<b>[chuckles]</b> <b>I don't.</b>

37:10.986 --> 37:12.219
<b>- I feel the same way.</b>

37:12.220 --> 37:13.220
<b>- All right, let's do it.</b>

37:25.967 --> 37:29.003
<b>- Team Peck, today you had to</b>
<b>tattoo a peacock.</b>

37:29.004 --> 37:31.972
<b>Based on your work, one of you</b>
<b>will be the first artist</b>

37:31.973 --> 37:36.143
<b>from Team Peck to pack your</b>
<b>machines.</b>

37:36.144 --> 37:38.679
<b>Team Nuñez, you guys voted Geary</b>
<b>to the bottom.</b>

37:38.680 --> 37:39.947
<b>Why did you guys make that</b>
<b>choice?</b>

37:39.948 --> 37:42.650
<b>- We all just agreed that it was</b>
<b>poor execution,</b>

37:42.651 --> 37:44.718
<b>poor planning from the start.</b>

37:44.719 --> 37:47.388
<b>- Well, Geary, of all the</b>
<b>shortcomings of this tattoo,</b>

37:47.389 --> 37:49.657
<b>the thing that I think is</b>
<b>missing the most</b>

37:49.658 --> 37:51.459
<b> <i>is your artistic creativity.</i> </b>

37:51.460 --> 37:53.661
<b>It was just a downhill slide for</b>
<b>you on this one.</b>

37:53.662 --> 37:55.696
<b>- Yeah, it got away from me</b>
<b>pretty quickly, I'd say.</b>

37:55.697 --> 37:59.967
<b>- Ryan, this is probably my most</b>
<b>disappointing tattoo of the day.</b>

37:59.968 --> 38:01.702
<b> <i>The unfinished part is one</i> </b>
<b> <i>thing.</i> </b>

38:01.703 --> 38:04.538
<b> <i>The bigger part of the problem</i> </b>
<b> <i>is all the inconsistencies</i> </b>

38:04.539 --> 38:07.675
<b> <i>in this line work, all the</i> </b>
<b> <i>unsaturated areas of color.</i> </b>

38:07.676 --> 38:11.245
<b>- I think I got overwhelmed by</b>
<b>the amount of color and size.</b>

38:11.246 --> 38:12.980
<b>I just freaked out.</b>

38:12.981 --> 38:14.682
<b>- So you agree with being down</b>
<b>here?</b>

38:14.683 --> 38:15.783
<b>- Absolutely.</b>

38:15.784 --> 38:17.685
<b>I really mismanaged my time.</b>

38:17.686 --> 38:19.854
<b>- You have a very clean, very</b>
<b>solid outline.</b>

38:19.855 --> 38:21.989
<b>Trying to haul ass and cut</b>
<b>corners when it's</b>

38:21.990 --> 38:25.025
<b>under a microscope... that [bleep]</b>
<b>don't fly here.</b>

38:25.026 --> 38:26.427
<b>- Gia.</b>

38:26.428 --> 38:27.628
<b>- There's just so much</b>
<b>recklessness going on</b>

38:27.629 --> 38:28.963
<b> <i>in the bottom of this tattoo.</i> </b>

38:28.964 --> 38:30.464
<b> <i>How many more canvases do we</i> </b>
<b> <i>want to see</i> </b>

38:30.465 --> 38:31.799
<b> <i>get tattoos like this?</i> </b>

38:31.800 --> 38:33.134
<b>- I'm not happy with it.</b>

38:33.135 --> 38:36.203
<b>I'm not delusional about how</b>
<b>messy it is.</b>

38:36.204 --> 38:38.806
<b>- It's precision day, so if you</b>
<b>get reckless here</b>

38:38.807 --> 38:43.644
<b>and your tattoo's unfinished,</b>
<b>that's what will send you home.</b>

38:43.645 --> 38:44.712
<b>Well, I just have a question.</b>

38:44.713 --> 38:45.713
<b>Why do you guys look so</b>
<b>terrible?</b>

38:45.714 --> 38:47.281
<b>What's wrong with you guys?</b>

38:47.282 --> 38:49.650
<b>- In my opinion, some of the</b>
<b>best people from the opposite</b>

38:49.651 --> 38:53.654
<b>team is down here, and there's</b>
<b>people that I don't personally</b>

38:53.655 --> 38:55.423
<b>believe should still be safe...</b>

38:55.424 --> 38:56.957
<b>- Such as who?</b>

38:56.958 --> 38:58.826
<b>- I think Dave should be down</b>
<b>here, because he's not...</b>

38:58.827 --> 39:00.494
<b>- Dave colored inside the lines.</b>

39:00.495 --> 39:01.662
<b>- He did.</b> <b>He did.</b>

39:01.663 --> 39:02.897
<b>I'm saying...</b> <b>- That's it.</b>

39:02.898 --> 39:03.931
<b>That's what it takes</b>
<b>to not be here.</b>

39:03.932 --> 39:05.199
<b>If you color outside the</b> <b>lines...</b>

39:05.200 --> 39:07.568
<b>hi, welcome to the bottom.</b>

39:07.569 --> 39:09.370
<b>- Coming down here is a mark.</b>

39:09.371 --> 39:11.672
<b>The further we go down this</b>
<b>road, the people</b>

39:11.673 --> 39:13.607
<b>who have been in the bottom the</b>
<b>most times,</b>

39:13.608 --> 39:15.209
<b>that's gonna come up.</b>

39:15.210 --> 39:17.611
<b>If you stay in the competition,</b>
<b>don't come back to the bottom</b>

39:17.612 --> 39:20.214
<b>for the same mistake,</b>
<b>'cause that's a killer.</b>

39:20.215 --> 39:21.649
<b>- All right, judges.</b>

39:21.650 --> 39:25.086
<b>Time to decide</b>
<b>who is going home.</b>

39:25.087 --> 39:26.620
<b>- At the end of the day, I think</b>
<b>the tattoo with</b>

39:26.621 --> 39:29.290
<b>the most struggle and just the</b>
<b>most troubling one</b>

39:29.291 --> 39:31.625
<b>for me would be Geary.</b>

39:31.626 --> 39:32.726
<b>- You've struggled a few times,</b>

39:32.727 --> 39:34.328
<b>and here you are again in the</b>
<b>bottom.</b>

39:34.329 --> 39:36.464
<b>I can't help but vote for Geary.</b>

39:36.465 --> 39:37.832
<b>Chris?</b>

39:37.833 --> 39:39.667
<b>- Geary.</b>

39:39.668 --> 39:41.202
<b>- The judges have decided.</b>

39:41.203 --> 39:45.106
<b>Geary, you do not have what it</b>
<b>takes to be Ink Master.</b>

39:45.107 --> 39:47.174
<b>- As a creative artist,</b>
<b>you've got a lot</b>

39:47.175 --> 39:48.642
<b>of people in the room beat.</b>

39:48.643 --> 39:50.678
<b>This setting, you're probably</b>
<b>one of the people</b>

39:50.679 --> 39:54.448
<b>that's least equipped to operate</b>
<b>in this kind of challenge.</b>

39:54.449 --> 39:57.285
<b>- Please pack your machines and</b>
<b>close shop.</b>

40:01.223 --> 40:03.657
<b> <i>- I don't really think I have a</i> </b>
<b> <i>disability, necessarily,</i> </b>

40:03.658 --> 40:07.328
<b>but I do feel like the physical</b>
<b>part was a big factor.</b>

40:07.329 --> 40:09.396
<b>I think mentally it was a bigger</b>
<b>factor because</b>

40:09.397 --> 40:10.798
<b>I was constantly worried</b>
<b>about it.</b>

40:10.799 --> 40:12.601
<b>I let it affect my</b>
<b>decision-making.</b>

40:17.372 --> 40:19.607
<b> <i>announcer: On the next episode</b>
<b>of "Ink Master"...</i> </b>

40:19.608 --> 40:22.277
<b>- This week, no one is safe.</b>

40:23.745 --> 40:25.079
<b> <i>- Double elimination day...</i> </b>

40:25.080 --> 40:27.181
<b>the only word that comes to mind</b>
<b>is "[bleep]."</b>

40:27.182 --> 40:28.749
<b>- This is your chance to stay</b>
<b>alive.</b>

40:28.750 --> 40:31.318
<b>- I think that we can give the</b>
<b>boys a run for their money.</b>

40:31.319 --> 40:33.020
<b>- Look, my hand is forced,</b>
<b>but it's on.</b>

40:33.021 --> 40:34.755
<b>- I am on my own,</b>
<b>and I am alone.</b>

40:34.756 --> 40:36.290
<b>- I feel like you're kind of</b>
<b>stabbing me in the back.</b>

40:36.291 --> 40:38.993
<b>- They made us [bleep] dogs,</b>
<b>and then they dog fight us.</b>

40:38.994 --> 40:40.227
<b>- They should be afraid.</b>

40:40.228 --> 40:41.862
<b>- These are not the same [bleep]</b>
<b>colors.</b>

40:41.863 --> 40:43.164
<b>- You made a mess.</b>

40:43.165 --> 40:44.632
<b>- I [bleep] up, man.</b>

40:44.633 --> 40:46.200
<b>- So it looks like you were in</b>
<b>the back of a 4x4,</b>

40:46.201 --> 40:47.301
<b>like this, you know, or...</b>

40:47.302 --> 40:48.669
<b>- Oh, it felt that way.</b>

40:48.670 --> 40:50.404
<b>- That line work, that's got</b>
<b>your name on it.</b>

40:50.405 --> 40:52.686
<b>- You're on the same team, but</b>
<b>this is the battle brewing.</b>
