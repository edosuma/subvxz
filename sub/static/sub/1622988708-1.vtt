34:42.583 --> 34:43.958
You should go to a hospital.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.166
- Well then they’ll know what happened.

34:48.875 --> 34:51.208
- Just like when I was
in the chorus of Brigadoon.

34:52.083 --> 34:55.500
Ah, not a lot of people
have heard of it. Joe has.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.541
(Mary) He was a Newsie, and a Pippin.

34:58.500 --> 35:01.333
But what’s that got to do with
the price of rice and Arty Skoller?

35:01.958 --> 35:02.875
- (Eli) Excuse me?

35:05.958 --> 35:09.125
- (Mary) Arty kept falling in the
orchestra pit during the blackouts,

35:09.666 --> 35:11.291
’cause he was blind in one eye.

35:12.375 --> 35:16.000
But that was a lie, and we all knew it.

35:16.791 --> 35:20.208
David Brooks played Tommy, the star part,

35:20.625 --> 35:24.500
but he was a damn bully and he
kept pushing Arty in,

35:25.333 --> 35:27.791
because Arty was a better dancer.

35:29.333 --> 35:30.875
We all asked Arty,

35:30.875 --> 35:32.916
why don’t you just tell the stage manager,

35:33.250 --> 35:35.208
or quit, or kick his ass.

35:35.208 --> 35:37.375
Hell, we’ll do it for you
if you don’t want to,

35:37.916 --> 35:39.625
but all Arty kept saying is,

35:41.041 --> 35:42.708
“I’m blind in one eye!”

35:44.166 --> 35:47.041
After months of the cello player
breaking his fall,

35:47.041 --> 35:48.583
I took him aside

35:50.166 --> 35:52.041
and I said “Jesus, Arty,"

35:53.958 --> 35:55.875
“you still got your other eye.”

35:59.125 --> 36:00.958
- You can do something
about almost anything.

36:02.333 --> 36:03.708
- You’re very stealthy.

36:04.500 --> 36:05.541
- (Simon) Aren’t they all?

36:06.833 --> 36:08.166
- How did it happen, Eli?

36:15.375 --> 36:16.583
- (Eli) I gotta go.

36:20.958 --> 36:23.750
- If you go, you don’t get back in.

36:27.583 --> 36:29.666
- (Mo) The bar is a temple.

36:30.875 --> 36:31.833
- (Mo) I’m a rabbi.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.625
Bring your Camels.

36:38.416 --> 36:39.750
- (Eli) I’m not a very good Jew.

36:40.541 --> 36:41.750
- (Mo) Bring them anyway.

36:47.916 --> 36:50.041
- Mo knows I hate it as much
as when he hides it.

36:52.083 --> 36:53.458
- You see Matt over there?

36:55.541 --> 36:57.250
(Jess) Works his butt off for us.

36:58.458 --> 37:00.083
We can’t pay him what he deserves.

37:02.375 --> 37:04.458
But he loves it when he surprises us

37:04.458 --> 37:06.958
with a tax refund we didn’t expect.

37:08.583 --> 37:10.291
I asked him about it
and you know what he said?

37:11.041 --> 37:11.833
- What?

37:12.750 --> 37:16.291
- He said, when we do good deeds,

37:17.333 --> 37:19.625
we shouldn’t sound trumpets for ourselves

37:20.208 --> 37:22.375
like the hypocrites do in the streets.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.416
(Jess) But what we should do

37:25.750 --> 37:28.625
is a little secret something
for ourselves.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.666
- What’s that got to do with Mo?

37:37.666 --> 37:39.916
- Well if Mo can somehow pull off

37:39.916 --> 37:43.208
being all holy and a regular guy

37:45.375 --> 37:47.583
the man deserves to bum a smoke

37:49.083 --> 37:51.416
especially when he thinks
not even you know about it.

38:08.958 --> 38:09.958
- (Mo) Hey, you play?

38:10.333 --> 38:11.875
- (Eli) I thought you wanted
to bum a smoke.

38:12.291 --> 38:13.625
You’ve got some serious game.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.333
- (Mo) Too bad I don’t make
some serious money.

38:18.541 --> 38:19.458
- You know, it’s weird.

38:20.041 --> 38:21.291
I’ve been drinking all night

38:23.833 --> 38:25.000
and I don’t feel a thing.

38:25.583 --> 38:27.791
- (Mo) Well, it’s been a long night and--
- Yeah.

38:28.166 --> 38:30.000
You started long before you got here.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.333
- Wait, how do you know when I started?

38:37.500 --> 38:40.041
- (Mo) I know how much a guy drinks
when he said he started a month ago.

38:43.458 --> 38:45.541
- (Jess) Hey! You!

38:46.041 --> 38:48.375
Yeah, you with the big fat eye!

38:50.208 --> 38:52.541
She doesn’t beat you ’cause you drink.

38:56.791 --> 38:57.875
- (Dog) Let’s have it.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.041
We’re all in.

39:00.541 --> 39:01.541
- (Eli) Out on the street,

39:01.541 --> 39:03.666
there was this cold snap from the Hudson.

39:04.333 --> 39:05.708
But it’s warm here.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
- (Jess) I know. Spooky, ain’t it?

39:10.333 --> 39:11.833
- (Jess) All right.
- (Eli) Let’s do this.

39:12.041 --> 39:14.166
- (Mo) All right, It’s gonna be you and me

39:15.291 --> 39:16.250
versus him and Dog.

39:16.791 --> 39:18.291
- (Jess) Fine by me. Dad?

39:18.541 --> 39:19.333
- (Dog) I’m game.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.666
- Okay, now why don’t I like these odds?

39:21.916 --> 39:22.958
- (Dog) Don’t worry about it.

39:32.375 --> 39:34.208
- (Eli) Okay, is this guy
a chip off the old block?

39:34.208 --> 39:35.916
- (Jess) Yeah, the chip didn’t get the
height.

39:43.166 --> 39:44.958
- (Mo) That’s the good thing
about being adopted.

39:45.166 --> 39:46.541
- (Jess) Hey, you’re no Kobe either.

39:46.541 --> 39:47.208
- (Mo) Shoot!

39:51.458 --> 39:52.208
- (Dog) You okay?

39:58.125 --> 39:59.125
- Sorry.

40:01.916 --> 40:03.125
It’s been a rough few days.

40:04.375 --> 40:05.416
- Why’d she do it?

40:08.833 --> 40:10.625
- Who else knows?
- No one.

40:14.541 --> 40:17.083
It was the Mozart Concerto Number 3.

40:17.125 --> 40:18.375
- Beautiful piece.

40:19.916 --> 40:21.708
- (Jess) Was it playing when she hit you?

40:23.166 --> 40:25.166
- I play it every time I try to sleep.

40:26.333 --> 40:28.541
- Same part? Over and over?

40:29.041 --> 40:29.958
- (Eli) Um-hmm.

40:31.375 --> 40:35.208
- (Jess) When you hear it,
what’s it sound like?

40:41.833 --> 40:46.166
- At first it’s choppers

40:49.166 --> 40:50.666
and then there’s gunfire.

40:51.958 --> 40:55.541
- Dribble, but show us.

- (Mo) There it is.

so much about this?

41:29.375 --> 41:30.750
- (Jess) We’ve been where you are.

41:34.833 --> 41:37.333
- There were horrible screams
of men coming from inside.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.708
The other chopper was on
the other side of the dune.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.958
Then two of your guys rushed over.

41:43.958 --> 41:44.750
One of them was you.

- (Jess) You were blind.

51:20.458 --> 51:22.541
- I had no idea,
what’re you up to?

51:22.541 --> 51:24.291
- (Matt) Oh, well, I’m an accountant.
- (Gabe) Accountant?

I thought that’s what you were

51:25.708 --> 51:26.833
doing in New York.

maybe Fed Chair?

a hotel room for the night?

Wanna catch up, hang out?

51:41.291 --> 51:44.541
- Yeah, that’d actually be great.
You got any coke or pot or...?

51:44.541 --> 51:47.041
- Um... I’ve got some medical marijuana.

51:47.041 --> 51:50.083
- Oh, medical, huh?
- Yeah, back pain, took a fall.

51:50.166 --> 51:51.750
- Cool. Not the fall.

58:16.875 --> 58:18.041
that’d be great, would you?

58:21.500 --> 58:24.916
- I can think of a million reasons
why I should not marry you,

58:25.500 --> 58:29.750
but I can’t think of one
for not loving you

58:29.750 --> 58:32.166

anyone like this before.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.625
- He’s gonna say, it’s a road best not
taken for the fearful.

58:42.250 --> 58:44.208
- There’s no way anyone can guarantee

58:44.541 --> 58:47.166
what’s gonna go down in life
or between two people.

58:48.291 --> 58:50.458

first saw you, I...

I knew that if it was gonna be a man,
it was gonna be you.

How can anyone who loves
like this not want it all the time?

not taken for the fearful.

- If I don’t go through with this,
what happens to us, Mo?

Because I’m not that sure.
