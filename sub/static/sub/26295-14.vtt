WEBVTT

00:05.266 --> 00:08.269
- Can I confess something?
- Course you can.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.706
- So I picked a coffee shop
for our first date

00:10.749 --> 00:14.057
in case I needed
to make a quick getaway.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.755
- In case I was a dud?
Smart.

00:16.799 --> 00:19.541
Very smart.
I get it, trust me.

00:19.584 --> 00:23.719
But I'm going to guess that,
because you're letting me

00:23.762 --> 00:29.594
walk you home,
maybe not a dud?

00:29.638 --> 00:32.510
- You guessed right.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.860
Yeah, I've been here
about nine years now.

00:34.904 --> 00:37.820
- Love Lakeview.
Wrigley's right there.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.345
- Britt, what are you
doing out here?

00:41.389 --> 00:43.304
- I'm sorry.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.567
I went to the store,
wanted some chocolate milk,

00:45.610 --> 00:49.745
but I forgot my keys.
- And your jacket?

00:51.486 --> 00:53.357
This is my daughter, Britt.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.707
She's supposed to be staying
inside the apartment.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.709
- Please, Mom.
Can you just let me in?

00:57.753 --> 01:02.671
- Yes, come on.
Um, Britt has a problem.

01:02.714 --> 01:05.543
She's been clean a few
weeks now and doing great.

01:05.587 --> 01:08.242
It's just the withdrawal
symptoms are hard.

01:09.678 --> 01:12.159
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You okay?

01:12.202 --> 01:14.117
- My chest,
it hurts when I breathe.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.728
- Okay, um, we need to
get her to a hospital.

01:16.772 --> 01:17.903
- What?
No.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.383
- I'll let 'em know
we're coming.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.301
- Incoming.
Take Baghdad.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.260
- Yep.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.349
Cesar?
- Gabriel Park, 16,

01:28.392 --> 01:32.135
single GSW to the abdomen.
GCS 15, BP 98/66,

01:32.179 --> 01:33.789
heart rate 118, sats 100%.

01:33.832 --> 01:36.574
- I can't move my leg.
- Gabriel, I'm Dr. Rhodes.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.315
You hang in there.
What happened?

01:38.359 --> 01:40.230
- Gunman held up
the family store.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.579
- We were in the back,
stocking the freezer.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.668
- And Gabriel was working
the register.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.279
- Mr. and Mrs. Park,
why don't you come with me

01:45.322 --> 01:46.889
and let Dr. Rhodes work, okay?
- All right.

01:46.932 --> 01:49.544
On my count.
One, two, three.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.420
Single bullet hole,
interior abdomen.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.422
Let's get a chest x-ray
and log roll.

01:58.466 --> 02:01.425
On my count, one, two, three.
There we go.

02:01.469 --> 02:02.774
- No exit wound.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.254
All right, back down.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.603
Let's find out
where this bullet is.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.301
Everybody clear.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.173
- We're gonna take care
of you, Gabe.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.349
- X-ray's up.
- There it is.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.264
All right,
trans abdominal trajectory.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.613
He needs surgery.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.485
- Please, my left leg,
I can't feel it.

02:17.528 --> 02:19.443
- Gabriel, I'm going to do
everything I can to fix

02:19.487 --> 02:21.837
your leg, but right now I need
to look inside your belly

02:21.880 --> 02:23.230
and make sure that
everything is okay.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.449
You understand me?
Good.

02:25.493 --> 02:26.798
Call for blood.

02:26.842 --> 02:27.973
Let's move him over
to the hybrid OR.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.366
Page my team.
Let's go.

02:35.546 --> 02:38.201
- Will.
- What's up, Jay?

02:38.245 --> 02:39.507
- They just brought
that kid in.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.552
He was shot
in a convenience store.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.815
- Okay.
- So we caught the guy,

02:43.859 --> 02:45.252
and we got the gun
that he used.

02:45.295 --> 02:48.429
- Good.
Why are you telling me?

02:48.472 --> 02:51.997
- CPD ran the serial number
on it, and it's your gun...

02:52.041 --> 02:54.217
The one that was stolen.

03:08.666 --> 03:13.758
- Hey.
Any word on the boy?

03:13.802 --> 03:15.934
I heard it was your gun.
- Don't say it, okay?

03:15.978 --> 03:17.240
The last thing I need
right now is a lecture.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.068
- I wasn't going to.

03:19.111 --> 03:20.678
- It's not like I put the gun
in the shooter's hand.

03:20.722 --> 03:23.812
It was stolen from me.
- I know that.

03:23.855 --> 03:26.771
Look, I know this is
a terrible situation.

03:26.815 --> 03:29.165
I just hope you're talking
to someone.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.690
Your therapist or--
- Why do you even care?

03:32.734 --> 03:37.869
You said we
were done, remember?

03:37.913 --> 03:40.307
- Hey, any update
on Britt Mills?

03:40.350 --> 03:41.960
- Other than learning
from her mom you two

03:42.004 --> 03:44.093
were on your first date?

03:44.136 --> 03:46.095
- It had to be awkward
to find her daughter like that.

03:46.138 --> 03:47.792
- Yeah.

03:47.836 --> 03:50.578
- Britt's echocardiogram
is showing endocarditis.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.797
It happens sometimes with
intravenous drug users.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.104
I bet bacteria from a needle
worked its way to the heart.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.237
- What's cardiology saying?

03:57.280 --> 03:59.674
- They advise against surgery.
I think we should treat

03:59.717 --> 04:01.763
with a six week course
of antibiotics,

04:01.806 --> 04:03.721
so we need to put
in a PICC line.

04:03.765 --> 04:06.289
- PICC line?
I don't know.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.031
I mean she's only been clean
a few weeks.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.033
Leaving a catheter in her arm?

04:11.076 --> 04:12.904
That's almost an invitation
to relapse.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.906
- But if we don't, she'll have
to come into the hospital

04:14.950 --> 04:19.302
twice a day for infusions.
- Got to be another way.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.957
- Dr. Rhodes.
- Thanks.

04:23.828 --> 04:28.050
- Connor, is the kid
gonna be okay?

04:28.093 --> 04:29.965
- Yeah, he'll definitely live.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.793
We repaired a bunch of small
bowel where the bullet

04:31.836 --> 04:34.230
tore through, but it's still
lodged in his spinal canal.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.971
- How bad is it?

04:36.014 --> 04:37.668
- Too soon to tell,
but, when he came in,

04:37.712 --> 04:39.801
he said he lost feeling
in his left leg.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.324
We're sending him up to CT,

04:41.368 --> 04:43.805
get a better idea of
what's going on.

04:43.848 --> 04:45.894
Neurology's gonna take
a look at him.

04:45.937 --> 04:48.766
We got it.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.118
- Maggie, female mid-30s,
syncopal episode in the field.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.425
Down maybe 30 seconds
before roused by bystanders.

04:55.469 --> 04:56.687
- Sydney?

04:56.731 --> 04:58.907
- Hey, Maggie.
- Hey.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.822
Dr. Lanik, you're
going to treatment 3.

05:00.865 --> 05:03.303
- Went from GCS 12 to 14
with a sternal rub,

05:03.346 --> 05:06.044
supplemental oxygen,
and 250 mils normal saline.

05:06.088 --> 05:09.396
Monitor showing multiple PVCs.
- I fainted.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.789
- Yes, and we're going to take
very good care of you.

05:11.833 --> 05:15.010
- BP's a little low, 100/66,
and heart rate, 78.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.838
But I'm not sure
if she's beta blocked.

05:16.881 --> 05:20.320
- Okay, transfer on my count.
One, two, three.

05:20.363 --> 05:23.148
- She's got a tunneled cath
in the left upper chest.

05:23.192 --> 05:26.978
- That's for dialysis.
She's on the list for a kidney.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.806
- Hey, order a 12-lead EKG.
- All right.

05:28.850 --> 05:33.855
- Am I gonna be okay?
- Yes, you are.

05:33.898 --> 05:36.292
- Where's that x-ray?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.166
Okay, clear.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.958
Ms. Curry?
- Ooh, mild fluid overload.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.003
- So?
- Cardiac enzymes,

05:52.047 --> 05:54.397
BMP, CBC,
blood cultures times two.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.833
- Yeah, give her
a dose of vanc.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.835
25 milligrams per kilogram.
- On it.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.881
- Repeat her vitals and let me
know when her labs are back.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.144
- Okay.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.238
- Okay.

06:12.023 --> 06:15.897
- You know this patient?
- She grew up near me.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.987
Came in a couple weeks ago
with sepsis.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.293
I should have
seen her immediately.

06:26.168 --> 06:28.083
- Feels like somebody sitting
on my chest

06:28.126 --> 06:29.389
and my back
at the same time

06:29.432 --> 06:30.999
ever since we
got back from

06:31.042 --> 06:33.044
that cross country ski trip
two days ago.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.829
I never felt anything
like this.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.527
- This isn't like him.
Patrick's always so healthy,

06:37.571 --> 06:40.965
even if he sort of let himself
go the last few years.

06:41.009 --> 06:43.228
- Really, Alice?

06:43.272 --> 06:44.926
- It's your medical history.

06:44.969 --> 06:48.277
It's relevant, isn't it?

06:48.320 --> 06:50.410
- Uh, yeah.

07:00.071 --> 07:03.292
Does the pain extend down
your arm or up to your jaw?

07:03.335 --> 07:06.817
- No.
- Does this hurt?

07:06.861 --> 07:08.558
Out of ten,
ten being the most painful.

07:08.602 --> 07:11.909
- Mm, I guess a five.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.911
- Okay, let's get
a CBC, CMP, troponins,

07:13.955 --> 07:18.220
and set Mr. Novak
up for an EKG.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.265
- Patrick?

07:22.833 --> 07:24.531
- No pulse.
- What?

07:24.574 --> 07:26.141
- He's not breathing, bag him.
- Got it.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.969
- But he's got
normal sinus rhythm.

07:28.012 --> 07:28.970
- There's no pulse.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.450
He's in PEA.
Call a code.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.321
- Patrick?
- We need help in here!

07:32.364 --> 07:35.280
- Need an airway!
- Look.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.282
- He just opened his eyes.
He's breathing on his own.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.328
- Oh, thank God.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.939
Honey, are you okay?

07:41.983 --> 07:44.420
- Patrick?
- Asystole.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.075
- Milligram of epi, now.
- Wha--

07:47.118 --> 07:49.120
- Intubate him.

07:49.164 --> 07:50.948
- Hold off.
Patient's breathing on his own.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.342
- Can someone tell me
what is happening?

07:53.385 --> 07:55.257
- Your husband is
in cardiac arrest,

07:55.300 --> 07:56.519
but as long as
I'm doing compressions,

07:56.563 --> 07:58.216
he's getting oxygen
to his brain.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.349
We'll keep at it until
his heart takes over.

08:00.392 --> 08:03.091
- Honey, Patrick.
I'm right here.

08:06.616 --> 08:09.010
- You're saying it's not
just the withdrawal?

08:09.053 --> 08:10.838
I have a heart infection?

08:10.881 --> 08:13.580
- Symptoms of endocarditis
usually come on slowly

08:13.623 --> 08:16.496
and they're often mistaken
for heroin withdrawal.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.498
- The chest pains you were
feeling this morning.

08:18.541 --> 08:22.023
- We can treat endocarditis
with long-term antibiotics,

08:22.066 --> 08:24.982
which normally involve leaving
a catheter in the arm.

08:25.026 --> 08:26.288
A PICC line.

08:26.331 --> 08:29.073
- It's okay,
I'm used to needles.

08:29.117 --> 08:32.468
- Britt, we really get how
tricky early sobriety can be

08:32.512 --> 08:33.991
and we just want to put you in

08:34.035 --> 08:36.080
the best possible position
to succeed.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.343
So if we're gonna
give you this PICC line,

08:38.387 --> 08:40.302
there's something else
we'd also like you to consider.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.217
- What?
- Well, it's a drug

08:42.260 --> 08:45.307
called Naltrexone that blocks
the effects of opioids

08:45.350 --> 08:47.396
on the brain's limbic system,

08:47.439 --> 08:50.094
essentially making it
impossible to get high.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.531
- There's a drug
that'll stop me

08:51.574 --> 08:54.534
from getting high?
- Let's do that.

08:54.577 --> 08:57.667
- Listen, Naltrexone is by
no means a magic bullet,

08:57.711 --> 09:00.061
and it comes with
certain very real risks.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.671
- The thing is, Britt,
you can't take it

09:01.715 --> 09:04.413
unless you've been opioid free
for at least 14 days.

09:04.456 --> 09:07.416
If there are any opioids
in your system,

09:07.459 --> 09:10.375
the Naltrexone could trigger
severe side effects.

09:10.419 --> 09:14.031
- I'm clean.
- For over two weeks.

09:14.075 --> 09:17.339
- Okay, well, it's also crucial
for you to understand,

09:17.382 --> 09:20.429
if you were to use, it could
very well lead to an overdose.

09:20.472 --> 09:23.084
- I'm not going to.
Ever.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.303
- She's been trying so hard.

09:27.218 --> 09:29.220
- Okay, well, we just need
to do a urine test

09:29.264 --> 09:31.962
to be safe and, uh--
and we're set.

09:32.006 --> 09:35.357
- Okay.
- This is great, I mean--

09:46.237 --> 09:48.239
- Ava.
- Hello, Connor.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.590
- Um...

09:50.633 --> 09:52.592
how's the hand?

09:52.635 --> 09:56.465
- Ah, it's much better.
It was my fault.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.249
I should have
gotten my hand out of the way.

09:58.293 --> 10:01.383
- Well, maybe I could have
been a little more careful.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.612
Look, I am sorry that
I haven't been able

10:12.655 --> 10:16.224
to come by to check on you.
- It's okay.

10:16.267 --> 10:19.531
I know we're not in
the best of places right now.

10:19.575 --> 10:22.273
- Yeah.
- Dr. Rhodes.

10:22.317 --> 10:26.277
Once again, you are doing
your best to ruin my day.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.758
- Maybe I should go.
- No, no, you stay, Dr. Bekker.

10:28.802 --> 10:33.110
This concerns you, too.
Two months ago, you operated on

10:33.154 --> 10:35.591
a gunshot victim,
Shawn Corcoran?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.680
- Yeah?
- And you assisted?

10:37.724 --> 10:41.553
He died,
and someone is alleging

10:41.597 --> 10:44.208
that you brought him to the ICU
with his abdomen left open

10:44.252 --> 10:45.775
when you should
have closed him.

10:45.819 --> 10:49.126
And then, you lightened
his anesthesia prematurely

10:49.170 --> 10:51.302
while contributing
to his death.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.739
- Who made these allegations?

10:52.782 --> 10:55.132
- It was
an anonymous complaint.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.700
Unfortunately, the hospital
oversight committee is obliged

10:57.744 --> 11:01.095
to do a root cause analysis
into the case.

11:01.138 --> 11:04.489
You'll both be interviewed.
- And then what?

11:04.533 --> 11:07.710
- Well, if the committee finds
that the charges have merit,

11:07.754 --> 11:09.494
you, Dr. Rhodes,
will be brought before

11:09.538 --> 11:11.148
a peer review board.

11:11.192 --> 11:14.674
But hopefully
that does not happen.

11:14.717 --> 11:17.589
Your hybrid OR has cost
this hospital a fortune,

11:17.633 --> 11:19.548
but it has made
for some good PR.

11:19.591 --> 11:24.553
The last thing I need is
a scandal involving its chief.

11:28.122 --> 11:31.691
- Connor, peer review?
You could lose your license.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.738
- Yeah.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.266
- Mr. Davis, you're back.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.704
- Yeah, it's starting to feel
like we live here.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.793
But I'm just a little bit
worried about Sophie.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.925
- What's the matter with her?
- She's not eating

11:48.969 --> 11:51.536
like she should, and she's
sleeping more than usual.

11:51.580 --> 11:52.886
- All right, well, why don't
you lay her down right here

11:52.929 --> 11:54.017
and I'll take a look, okay?

11:54.061 --> 11:56.367
- Okay.
You're okay.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.763
- Just right here.
Hey.

12:03.679 --> 12:06.421
- You're all right.

12:06.464 --> 12:09.990
- 100.1.
- She is running a fever.

12:20.348 --> 12:24.526
- I'm not seeing
anything unexpected.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.833
- Okay.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.748
- Don't worry,
we'll figure this out.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.796
Put in an IV and check
the patency of the g-tube.

12:33.840 --> 12:34.971
It could just be she's not

12:35.015 --> 12:36.799
getting her fluids
and nutrition in.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.496
- Right.
- This have anything to do

12:38.540 --> 12:40.803
with her heart condition?
- I don't know yet.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.762
Um, it could just be
that, right now,

12:42.805 --> 12:44.720
she's not getting
the nourishment she needs.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.417
But let's just
check the tube first,

12:46.461 --> 12:48.419
and then, we'll go
from there, okay?

12:48.463 --> 12:51.422
- Okay.
- All right.

12:51.466 --> 12:55.687
- Ms. Hawkins, your tests show
potassium 9.2,

12:55.731 --> 12:59.082
chloride 115,
BUN 105, and creatinine 6.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.084
- What that mean?
- It means your dialysis

13:01.128 --> 13:02.825
hasn't been working.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.958
When was the last time
that you went to the center?

13:05.001 --> 13:07.047
- A few days ago.
Why?

13:07.090 --> 13:09.701
- And did they mention any
problems with your flow rates?

13:09.745 --> 13:12.443
Because your catheter
is clotted.

13:12.487 --> 13:15.795
Maybe told you to come to the
hospital and get it replaced?

13:15.838 --> 13:19.886
- Oh, something like that,
maybe, yeah.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.844
But then I got too sick.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.803
- That's okay,
we'll get it all fixed up,

13:23.846 --> 13:25.587
and get you
emergency dialysis.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.764
- Mm-hmm, meanwhile, we need
to lower your potassium.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.461
Let's give her an amp
of bicarbonate,

13:30.505 --> 13:32.637
ten units regular insulin,
an amp of D50,

13:32.681 --> 13:34.988
and then,
8.4 grams of patiromer.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.337
- Got it.

13:39.644 --> 13:40.994
- All of that?

13:43.997 --> 13:46.086
It's really bad, isn't it?

13:46.129 --> 13:49.045
- Mm-hmm.
You need a new kidney.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.525
I'm gonna see
if I can get you moved up

13:50.568 --> 13:53.049
on the transplant list.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.878
- Maggie...

13:55.922 --> 13:58.489
You're taking
such good care of me.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.623
Thank you.

14:09.674 --> 14:13.417
- No more ski trips,
I promise.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.550
I know you didn't want to go.

14:15.593 --> 14:18.422
- Dr. Halstead,
should we get him on ECMO?

14:18.466 --> 14:19.859
- We can't put a patient
on ECMO

14:19.902 --> 14:21.164
unless we have a plan
to get him off it.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.862
- Then what can we do?
- This is it.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.515
There's nothing else.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.953
I'm not gonna stop
until his pulse comes back.

14:29.694 --> 14:33.176
- You need a break.
Let me take over for a while.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.877
- All right.
Switch.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.886
Hey, you good?

14:46.929 --> 14:50.063
I'll be right back.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.500
- Based on my experience,

14:52.543 --> 14:55.416
it's definitely
the best course of action.

14:55.459 --> 14:56.765
Okay.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.030
Hey, Sam.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.858
What's the report
on the GSW victim?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.947
- Since when
is he your patient?

15:04.991 --> 15:06.862
- Come on, Sam.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.820
- Bullet lodged
in his cord at T12,

15:08.864 --> 15:10.431
hematoma surrounding the cord.

15:10.474 --> 15:11.911
Kid's hemiplegic
on his left side,

15:11.954 --> 15:13.869
right leg still works.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.566
- Wait, so there's a chance
he'll regain feeling

15:15.610 --> 15:17.220
in his left leg
when you pull the bullet out?

15:17.264 --> 15:19.962
- No, we're leaving it in.
Removing the bullet risks

15:20.006 --> 15:22.443
substantial bleeding along
with more potential damage

15:22.486 --> 15:23.879
to the spinal cord,
which could result

15:23.923 --> 15:25.446
in the kid being paraplegic.

15:25.489 --> 15:26.969
- Well, isn't that
worth the risk

15:27.013 --> 15:28.710
if it means he might gain
full function back?

15:28.753 --> 15:31.582
- Well, I'd rather have one
good leg than two bad ones.

15:31.626 --> 15:34.020
- Wait, look, we're talking
about a kid, here.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.847
Okay, with his whole life
ahead of him.

15:35.891 --> 15:38.850
- Halstead, no one asked
for your uninformed opinion,

15:38.894 --> 15:40.461
and the family's
made their decision.

15:40.504 --> 15:43.943
Go back to the ED
and put a Band-Aid on someone.

15:54.736 --> 15:58.261
- Good news, the urine tox
screen came back clean.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.785
- I wasn't worried.

16:00.829 --> 16:03.092
- Monique, let's administer
the first dose of Naltrexone,

16:03.136 --> 16:05.790
then send her up
to the IR for a PICC line.

16:05.834 --> 16:06.835
- Could you turn
on your side, please?

16:06.878 --> 16:08.968
- Mm-hmm.
- Honey...

16:09.011 --> 16:10.665
Are you--
are you sure about this?

16:10.708 --> 16:12.101
This is a really big step.

16:12.145 --> 16:15.104
- Yes, Mom.
I'm sure.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.759
- Just a little pinch, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

16:21.284 --> 16:25.636
- That's it.
- Thank you, both.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.859
- I understand what she does
for a living,

16:30.902 --> 16:33.818
but she's been responsible
with her health.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.212
No--

16:36.256 --> 16:38.519
She's not high risk.

16:40.347 --> 16:44.307
Yes.
I understand.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.614
- That about Sydney?

16:48.181 --> 16:51.010
- Yeah, she's on the bottom
of the transplant list

16:51.053 --> 16:52.750
because she's a sex worker.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.016
When she came in,
I kept her waiting.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.234
I didn't take her seriously.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.323
I didn't realize
that she was septic.

17:06.677 --> 17:07.983
Maybe if I hadn't
kept her waiting,

17:08.027 --> 17:09.593
this wouldn't have happened.

17:09.637 --> 17:13.728
- Maggie, you don't know that.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.860
- You know, we grew up a couple
blocks from each other.

17:15.904 --> 17:19.864
Huge difference,
those couple blocks.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.871
April?

17:26.915 --> 17:29.874
I want you to do
a blood draw on me.

17:29.918 --> 17:33.008
- A blood draw?

17:33.052 --> 17:35.315
Maggie, you cannot be serious.

17:35.358 --> 17:39.275
- Treatment 4's open.
Let's go.

17:44.976 --> 17:49.068
- She's not breathing.
- Sats are down to 60%.

17:49.111 --> 17:53.246
- Start bagging.
- Sats are coming back up.

17:53.289 --> 17:56.684
88, 93.
- Need to intubate.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.217
I'm in.
Bag her.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.132
Call for a vent
and get a chest x-ray.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.404
- She's stable for now.
- What's wrong with her?

18:21.448 --> 18:24.146
- I don't know yet, but we're
gonna get to the bottom of it.

18:26.409 --> 18:29.108
- Come back, Patrick.
Please?

18:29.151 --> 18:33.808
Just come back.

18:33.851 --> 18:37.855
- Dr. Halstead,
it's been ten minutes.

18:37.899 --> 18:41.250
- No.

18:41.294 --> 18:44.035
Stay with me please, baby.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.087
- Excuse me.
Will, I need a word.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.703
- Gabriel and his parents
are now saying

18:59.747 --> 19:01.966
they want the surgery
to remove the bullet.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.664
- Glad to hear it.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.448
- You had no right
interfering with my patient.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.233
- Hey, all I did was make sure
they knew their options.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.800
- No, you went in there
and advocated for a surgery

19:09.844 --> 19:11.062
that they had decided against.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.716
- Connor, this kid shouldn't
have to live

19:12.760 --> 19:14.240
the rest of his life
with only one good leg.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.807
- No, he shouldn't,
but what happened happened,

19:16.851 --> 19:17.982
and we can't change that.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.201
- Well, maybe we can.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.724
Maybe he can go back
to the way he was.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.292
- Will, I get it, man.
It was your gun.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.946
You might have
some messed up idea

19:24.989 --> 19:26.165
that this was
somehow your fault,

19:26.208 --> 19:27.862
but pushing for
that surgery,

19:27.905 --> 19:30.038
the kid could wind up
in a wheelchair.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.301
- Or he could be made
whole again.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.825
I have a patient to attend to.

19:37.872 --> 19:42.006
- Help, help!
Somebody help my daughter!

19:46.054 --> 19:48.883
- Excuse me.
- Need noodle.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.189
Not noodle, uh...
- She's seizing,

19:50.232 --> 19:52.234
5 milligrams of Ativan.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.241
- Okay, meds are in.

19:59.285 --> 20:02.505
- Dan, help her,
help her, help her!

20:05.552 --> 20:09.251
- BP 154 over 94.
Heart rate 118.

20:09.295 --> 20:12.211
Sats 92%.
- She's stable.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.390
- How did that happen?
Was it the injection?

20:17.433 --> 20:20.219
- No, only if Britt
had drugs in her system.

20:20.262 --> 20:23.744
- Hm, but--but she didn't.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.093
Did she?

20:31.882 --> 20:34.755
- Maggie, come with me.

20:34.798 --> 20:37.236
We need the room.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.897
I'm on
the transplant committee.

20:46.941 --> 20:50.597
I am notified about
every HLA match.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.773
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out

20:52.816 --> 20:54.731
that you planned
to donate a kidney?

20:54.775 --> 20:56.559
- Well, I hoped you wouldn't,

20:56.603 --> 20:58.300
because I didn't want to have
this discussion with you.

20:58.344 --> 21:01.782
- Maggie, undergoing surgery
for a patient,

21:01.825 --> 21:05.133
an irreversible procedure,

21:05.176 --> 21:09.268
is a violation
of professional boundaries.

21:09.311 --> 21:13.402
- I'm sorry,
but I don't care.

21:13.446 --> 21:16.362
- So who are you doing it for?

21:16.405 --> 21:18.494
For her or for you?

21:18.538 --> 21:20.409
- For me?
- Well, look.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.324
I've gone through
Sydney's records.

21:22.368 --> 21:27.808
She was already in septic shock
when she came in, Maggie.

21:27.851 --> 21:30.332
We did everything
we could for her.

21:30.376 --> 21:35.511
So if this is coming out of
some misplaced sense of guilt--

21:35.555 --> 21:38.732
- She's at the bottom
of the transplant list.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.560
She's never gonna get a kidney,

21:40.603 --> 21:42.344
and she's gonna die
if I don't give her mine.

21:42.388 --> 21:46.305
- But have you stopped
to consider your own health?

21:46.348 --> 21:48.872
- Wha--
- Donating puts you at risk,

21:48.916 --> 21:50.613
Maggie, for infection,

21:50.657 --> 21:52.528
hypertension,
intestinal obstruction--

21:52.572 --> 21:54.704
- Those are
very rare side effects.

21:54.748 --> 22:01.624
- Okay, but what if
your remaining kidney fails?

22:01.668 --> 22:06.455
- People who donate kidneys do
just fine, and you know that.

22:09.458 --> 22:15.203
- It is still an ethical
violation and I can't--I just--

22:15.246 --> 22:18.293
I can't let you do this.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.339
- Sharon, there's nothing
that you can do

22:20.382 --> 22:21.775
that's gonna stop me.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.649
- Actually, there is.

22:26.693 --> 22:29.739
You're out of
paid sick leave days.

22:29.783 --> 22:32.742
You can't take
the time off to recover...

22:32.786 --> 22:37.312
Not without jeopardizing
your employment.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.924
- Lose my job?
You would do that?

22:40.968 --> 22:44.711
- Maggie, yes, I would.

23:01.728 --> 23:04.557
- She could have died.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.602
My baby could have died.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.996
- I'm just stumped as to how--

23:09.039 --> 23:11.477
how she passed the urine test.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.698
- I don't know.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.876
- Jackie.

23:23.358 --> 23:25.752
- It was mine.
It was my urine.

23:25.795 --> 23:28.711
She swore that she was clean,
and then, when you said

23:28.755 --> 23:32.411
she was gonna have to do
a drug test, she told me.

23:32.454 --> 23:36.632
She told me
she'd shot up a week ago.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.678
- And you went ahead anyway?

23:38.721 --> 23:41.898
- She--she said
that it wasn't that much.

23:41.942 --> 23:45.467
That it wouldn't matter.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.904
You have to understand,
this has been going on

23:47.948 --> 23:51.560
for such a long time.
I've tried everything.

23:51.604 --> 23:54.433
I got her a therapist.
I-I got her a job.

23:54.476 --> 23:57.087
I hardly ever
leave her alone.

23:57.131 --> 24:02.310
And still, every morning,
I wake up and I find

24:02.353 --> 24:06.706
that she's figured out
some other way to get high.

24:06.749 --> 24:11.841
The Naltrexone gave me hope
that it would save her.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.800
- Also could've killed her.

24:17.499 --> 24:22.983
- Jackie, I cannot even imagine
how brutal this must be.

24:23.026 --> 24:25.768
But I'm gonna
be very honest with you.

24:25.812 --> 24:29.772
As a parent, I understand
the need to protect your child,

24:29.816 --> 24:33.472
and as long
as you keep doing that,

24:33.515 --> 24:35.517
she's never
going to get better.

24:42.916 --> 24:45.788
- The committee's running
a little behind.

24:45.832 --> 24:48.095
- Ava, you are blameless
in all of this.

24:48.138 --> 24:50.663
I made every decision
in the OR.

24:52.099 --> 24:55.406
- Dr. Bekker,
they're ready for you.

25:10.987 --> 25:13.381
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:13.424 --> 25:19.648
- Sophie's MRI shows
an abscess--an area of swelling

25:19.692 --> 25:21.432
in the right frontal lobe
of her brain.

25:21.476 --> 25:23.565
It's an infection.

25:25.741 --> 25:27.569
- How--why--

25:27.613 --> 25:30.659
- It can happen in children
with congenital heart disease.

25:30.703 --> 25:32.835
Bacteria originating
from the heart

25:32.879 --> 25:35.011
travels up to their brain.
- Mm-hmm.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.883
- So the neurosurgeons would
like to take her up to

25:36.926 --> 25:39.494
the operating room to have
a catheter placed

25:39.538 --> 25:41.540
and the abscess drained.

25:41.583 --> 25:44.847
- A catheter in her head?

25:44.891 --> 25:47.676
- The good news is, is that
the abscess is small enough

25:47.720 --> 25:50.810
so that she won't need
a craniotomy--surgery.

25:52.681 --> 25:55.945
- When my wife found out
she had a brain aneurysm.

25:55.989 --> 25:58.992
the doctors said
it was small enough

25:59.035 --> 26:01.821
that she didn't need
to have surgery,

26:01.864 --> 26:03.910
and then it killed her.

26:06.260 --> 26:09.437
- I can't make you
any promises,

26:09.480 --> 26:11.091
but I can tell you
that this is

26:11.134 --> 26:13.615
an entirely different
situation.

26:14.877 --> 26:18.881
I'm hopeful.
You should be, too.

26:21.101 --> 26:23.233
- Okay.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.065
- Let me check for a pulse.

26:30.893 --> 26:33.461
Move.
- Patrick, come back!

26:33.504 --> 26:36.943
Oh, no.
No, you hang on, Patrick.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.815
Please.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.077
Oh, you hang on, Patrick.

26:41.121 --> 26:43.863
- Dr. Halstead.
- Oh, God.

26:43.906 --> 26:46.517
No...

26:58.181 --> 26:59.748
- I'm sorry.

27:03.883 --> 27:07.190
- It's my fault.

27:07.234 --> 27:09.497
I did this to him.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.676
- Okay, we are ready
to start your dialysis.

27:16.330 --> 27:18.593
- Huh?

27:20.116 --> 27:22.118
- Sydney?
- She's in V-Fib.

27:22.162 --> 27:24.686
- Ugh, it's her potassium.
Call a code.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.557
- Code blue!
Get Lanik in here.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.084
- Start bagging.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.781
- Still in V-fib.
Paddles.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.788
Charge to 200.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.964
- Charged.

27:42.008 --> 27:43.749
- Clear.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.843
- Still in V-fib.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.322
- Milligram of epi.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.284
- Epi is in.
- Charge again.

27:58.938 --> 28:02.115
- Charged.
- Clear.

28:09.078 --> 28:11.037
- Back in sinus rhythm.

28:14.388 --> 28:15.824
- Another round
of insulin, glucose,

28:15.868 --> 28:17.957
and two amps of bicarb.
- Got it.

28:24.659 --> 28:27.227
- Sydney, I'm right here.

28:41.589 --> 28:44.897
- Sam, don't do the surgery.
- Are you on drugs?

28:44.940 --> 28:45.898
You're the one
who pushed for this.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.464
- I was wrong.

28:47.508 --> 28:50.859
It wasn't a clinical decision.
It was emotional.

28:50.903 --> 28:53.296
- Yeah, well, it's too late.

28:53.340 --> 28:56.604
- Please, talk to the family.
- I already have.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.215
You made such
a compelling case for surgery

28:59.259 --> 29:00.826
that they're determined
to go through with it.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.958
- Well, tell them you refuse
to do the surgery.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.220
- I did.

29:04.264 --> 29:06.266
They said
they'd get another surgeon.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.834
At least if I do it, there's
a decent chance of success.

29:17.538 --> 29:18.974
- Come in.

29:21.237 --> 29:22.935
Maggie?

29:25.546 --> 29:29.506
- I'm applying for the
Family Medical Leave Act...

29:29.550 --> 29:32.945
to get the time off I'll need
for recovery from surgery.

29:32.988 --> 29:36.252
- You're determined to do this
no matter what I say?

29:36.296 --> 29:38.254
- Yes.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.998
- Why, Maggie?

29:44.521 --> 29:48.656
Why is this patient
so different from any other?

29:52.355 --> 29:53.617
- She isn't.

29:57.186 --> 30:00.973
I see so much suffering
every day--

30:01.016 --> 30:05.542
day after day--and there's
nothing I can do about it.

30:05.586 --> 30:10.460
But this time I can,
this one time.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.158
I can.

30:23.996 --> 30:26.912
- It's just impossible to think
that I would stand by

30:26.955 --> 30:28.870
and let her do this
to herself.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.306
- Well, it's completely
counterintuitive.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.352
I mean, as parents,
we're programmed

30:32.395 --> 30:35.224
to fix our children's
problems, right?

30:35.268 --> 30:37.574
- Dr. Charles,
did you release Britt?

30:37.618 --> 30:39.185
She's gone.
- Britt?

30:40.403 --> 30:43.058
Britt!
Britt!

30:45.191 --> 30:48.324
- She took her clothes, too.

30:48.368 --> 30:50.283
- Where's she gonna go
with a PICC line?

30:50.326 --> 30:52.024
- She went to get high.

30:56.028 --> 30:58.508
- Let's just hope
she doesn't OD.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.172
- Hey.

31:12.609 --> 31:15.047
- You were right.

31:15.090 --> 31:17.745
I felt guilty.

31:17.788 --> 31:20.400
Hoped I could
turn back the clock.

31:22.271 --> 31:24.447
Make it like the whole thing
never happened.

31:25.579 --> 31:27.233
- Yeah.

31:27.276 --> 31:28.974
- If he wakes up
worse than before,

31:29.017 --> 31:32.455
I'll never forgive myself.

31:32.499 --> 31:34.675
- Let's just hope for the best.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.462
- Connor.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.116
I heard you're facing
the oversight committee.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.423
What's that all about?

31:43.466 --> 31:46.730
- Old case, pro forma.
It's no big deal.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.569
She's not answering
any of my texts.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.702
I knew I shouldn't have
taken my eyes off her.

32:01.745 --> 32:03.486
- Jackie...

32:03.530 --> 32:05.662
- You don't understand.
I'm her mother.

32:05.706 --> 32:07.273
I have to find her.

32:07.316 --> 32:10.232
- And how many times
have you done that already?

32:19.328 --> 32:21.461
- Dr. Rhodes?

32:31.253 --> 32:34.996
- Dr. Rhodes, please.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.346
- Dr. Latham, I want it
to be clear that I bear

32:37.390 --> 32:38.782
full responsibility
for Mr. Corcoran's surgery

32:38.826 --> 32:40.828
and its outcome.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.830
- Be that as it may,
we didn't call you in

32:42.873 --> 32:46.094
to hear your statement.
We called you in to apologize.

32:47.704 --> 32:50.098
- Apologize?
- Dr. Bekker made it

32:50.142 --> 32:51.752
eminently clear
that all of your decisions

32:51.795 --> 32:53.841
were sound
both medically and ethically.

32:53.884 --> 32:56.322
I reviewed Mr. Corcoran's chart
and, given the severity

32:56.365 --> 32:59.368
of his injuries,
find no reason to disagree.

32:59.412 --> 33:02.415
- I'm not sure that Dr. Bekker
knows the details of the case.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.765
- Dr. Rhodes, the committee
has determined that

33:04.808 --> 33:08.334
you are not at fault
for Mr. Corcoran's death.

33:10.466 --> 33:12.164
- You may go.

33:26.221 --> 33:27.831
- You told them that I did
everything

33:27.875 --> 33:29.268
in the patient's
best interest?

33:29.311 --> 33:30.660
- Yeah.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.140
- You and I both know

33:32.184 --> 33:33.707
that some of my actions
were questionable.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.230
- We have no way of knowing

33:35.274 --> 33:36.710
if they had any effect
on the outcome.

33:36.753 --> 33:39.191
- Still, the oversight
committee should have heard--

33:39.234 --> 33:43.282
- Why, so you can face peer
review and lose your license?

33:43.325 --> 33:45.371
Connor,
I did it for you.

33:47.416 --> 33:49.592
I'd do anything for you.

34:03.606 --> 34:06.174
- Sam?

34:06.218 --> 34:07.610
- I was able to remove
the bullet

34:07.654 --> 34:08.916
without causing
any more trauma.

34:08.959 --> 34:10.831
- So?

34:10.874 --> 34:13.399
- He'll be fine.

34:14.704 --> 34:17.403
- Thank you.

34:17.446 --> 34:21.233
- You know, your behavior
today has been erratic,

34:21.276 --> 34:24.366
irrational,
and impulsive:

34:24.410 --> 34:27.717
hardly qualities one wants
to see in a physician.

34:27.761 --> 34:30.807
You need to get your head
out of your ass.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.473
- There's nothing
you can do right now.

34:44.517 --> 34:46.301
We just have to wait and see

34:46.345 --> 34:48.651
how Sophie responds
to the antibiotics.

34:50.479 --> 34:52.916
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

34:55.354 --> 34:57.834
- Okay.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.186
- Come in.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.712
- Mrs. Goodwin,
um...

35:07.409 --> 35:09.498
I'm not entirely comfortable
with how things were left

35:09.542 --> 35:11.457
with the oversight committee.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.633
- I am.

35:13.676 --> 35:16.244
- I just don't think that
Mr. Corcoran's case

35:16.288 --> 35:18.507
was accurately presented.

35:18.551 --> 35:21.510
- I'm guessing you're talking
about when you lightened

35:21.554 --> 35:23.686
his sedation so
Detective Halstead

35:23.730 --> 35:26.341
could interview him.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.561
- Yes.
- And wasn't that done

35:28.604 --> 35:32.869
in an attempt to save
Will Halstead's life?

35:32.913 --> 35:34.654
I assume when you made
that decision

35:34.697 --> 35:36.960
you hoped Mr. Corcoran
would survive.

35:37.004 --> 35:40.442
- Mrs. Goodwin, lightening
Mr. Corcoran's sedation

35:40.486 --> 35:42.575
might have contributed
to his death.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.838
- Might have.
There's no way to know.

35:44.881 --> 35:48.624
He was gravely injured
when he was brought in.

35:50.931 --> 35:55.805
You know,
I was reminded today,

35:55.849 --> 35:59.592
in our effort
to help people that

35:59.635 --> 36:03.726
we sometimes find ourselves
in situations where

36:03.770 --> 36:08.557
what's right and what's wrong
isn't entirely clear.

36:08.601 --> 36:12.344
And we can only hope
that the decisions we do make

36:12.387 --> 36:14.694
are coming
from the right place.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.481
Go home,
Dr. Rhodes.

36:32.059 --> 36:36.498
- Hey.
- Gabriel pulled through.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.413
He's gonna be fine.

36:38.457 --> 36:40.981
- Glad to hear it.
For both of you.

36:41.024 --> 36:43.810
- Yeah.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.856
Sam Abrams told me
to get my head out of my ass.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.773
He's right.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.602
- Don't be too hard
on yourself.

36:53.646 --> 36:56.475
It was a tough call.
I get it.

36:59.129 --> 37:01.871
- I gotta find Nat.
- Night.

37:10.793 --> 37:14.362
- Congratulations, Connor.
Heard you got a pass.

37:17.104 --> 37:20.063
And I'm sure you thought
I was the snitch.

37:22.152 --> 37:25.504
- You know,
the thought crossed my mind.

37:25.547 --> 37:28.115
- I wish I could take credit,
but your patient croaked

37:28.158 --> 37:31.379
in the ICU and I didn't even
know about it,

37:31.423 --> 37:33.903
so I guess the question is,
who was the snitch?

37:33.947 --> 37:35.818
Why now?

37:35.862 --> 37:38.430
Months after the fact.

37:38.473 --> 37:40.606
Got an enemy out there.

37:44.044 --> 37:45.654
- So you'll be in tomorrow?

37:45.698 --> 37:48.918
- Yeah,
I'll see you in the morning.

37:48.962 --> 37:53.358
- Dr. Manning?
- You can call me Natalie.

37:53.401 --> 37:55.142
- Natalie.

37:56.665 --> 37:57.927
If it weren't for you,

37:57.971 --> 38:00.365
I don't know how
I would get through this.

38:02.454 --> 38:05.065
So thank you.
- Yeah.

38:08.068 --> 38:10.157
- Have a good night.
- You too.

38:16.642 --> 38:19.688
- Natalie.
- Yeah?

38:19.732 --> 38:21.647
- What's going on?

38:21.690 --> 38:22.996
- What?

38:23.039 --> 38:25.738
- I came to apologize
and tell you

38:25.781 --> 38:27.696
I wanna start taking
therapy seriously.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.045
- That's great.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.917
- But I find you
hugging this guy.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.875
- Will, I--
- No, tell me something.

38:32.919 --> 38:35.748
Was it all really about me
having a gun or was it about

38:35.791 --> 38:38.054
another guy and you just
couldn't tell me?

38:38.098 --> 38:39.708
- I don't even know
what to say to that.

38:39.752 --> 38:43.146
That man just lost his wife.
His baby could die.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.713
He is all alone.

38:44.757 --> 38:48.021
He needs someone
to be there for him.

38:48.064 --> 38:50.589
- So do I, Natalie.

38:50.632 --> 38:52.634
So do I.

39:04.080 --> 39:08.084
- What are you doing out here?
Aren't you going home?

39:08.128 --> 39:13.089
- I've been thinking
who was in the hybrid OR

39:13.133 --> 39:18.704
who knew about my decision who
had the expertise to judge it.

39:18.747 --> 39:21.663
- You think it was Marty?

39:21.707 --> 39:23.752
Or Sofia?

39:23.796 --> 39:24.971
- No, if they'd had a problem

39:25.014 --> 39:27.582
they would have raised it
at the time.

39:29.845 --> 39:32.021
I think it was you.

39:34.197 --> 39:36.939
- What?

39:36.983 --> 39:39.899
I-I defended you.

39:39.942 --> 39:42.162
- Exactly.
You're--

39:42.205 --> 39:45.600
you're like a pyromaniac that
sets a fire just to put it out.

39:48.255 --> 39:50.605
- Why in God's name
would I do that?

39:50.649 --> 39:52.607
- For the same reason
you slept with my father

39:52.651 --> 39:54.261
and put your hand
where you knew I would cut it.

39:54.304 --> 39:56.742
- What?
- To keep me tied to you.

39:56.785 --> 39:58.918
- Risk my health?

40:00.833 --> 40:02.922
- Like you said,
you'd do anything, right?

40:05.620 --> 40:07.840
- This is insane.

40:07.883 --> 40:09.842
My God,
can you hear yourself?

40:09.885 --> 40:11.104
- Ava, I think you got
a problem

40:11.147 --> 40:12.758
and I think you need
to get some help.

40:15.021 --> 40:20.505
- I've done nothing
but support you and help you.

40:20.548 --> 40:23.246
You're the one with
the problem, Connor.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.335
You're the one
who should get some help.
