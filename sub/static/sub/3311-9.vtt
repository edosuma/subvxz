00:06.407 --> 00:09.277
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.445
GOOD MORNING.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.247
- GOOD MORNING, JOE.
- GOOD MORNING.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.349
SOMETHING SMELLS REALLY GOOD
IN HERE AND I DIDN'T COOK IT.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.185
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?

00:17.218 --> 00:18.586
AUNT MEL MADE BREAKFAST.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.589
AND WHEN YOU THREW ALL THAT OUT
YOU ORDERED IN FROM A RESTAURANT?

00:23.191 --> 00:26.060
- YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.
- CINNAMON ROLLS.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.162
IT'S TRUE.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.597
FROM SCRATCH?

00:29.630 --> 00:32.066
IF "SCRATCH" MEANS BY
DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT,

00:32.100 --> 00:34.502
THEN YES, MY SHINY-HEADED
DOMESTIC FRIEND.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.606
THEY'RE GOOD.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.308
AND THEY'RE REAL.

00:42.310 --> 00:45.213
SO, JOE, HOW'S IT FEEL NOT
TO BE TOP CHEF ANYMORE?

00:45.246 --> 00:48.182
IT'S NOT REALLY A COMPETITION, RYDER.
IT'S JUST...

00:48.216 --> 00:50.518
PSST, BURKE.

00:52.186 --> 00:56.257
"FROM REFRIGERATOR TO
TABLE IN JUST MINUTES."

00:56.290 --> 00:58.592
I JUST USED THAT
FOR THE PICTURE...

00:58.626 --> 01:00.628
YOU KNOW, THE WAY AN
ARTIST USES A NUDE MODEL.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.265
DAMN YOU, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:04.298 --> 01:06.234
- DOLBY SOUND SYSTEM IN THE S.U.V.
- FINE.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.401
- 10 SPEAKERS.
- SIX.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.470
- EIGHT.
- DEAL.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.373
YOU DON'T REALLY NEED
MORE THAN EIGHT.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.475
I'VE STILL GOT IT.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.245
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. YOUR
AUNT HAS FINALLY TOPPED ME.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.247
THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR ME
TO DO NOW IS JUST LISTEN

01:19.280 --> 01:22.350
TO THE SWEET MUSIC OF DEFEAT.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.652
HI, NORMAL FAMILY.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.488
LENNOX, CAN I GET A
RIDE IN WITH YOU TODAY?

01:27.521 --> 01:29.523
MY MOM'S HAVING ONE
OF HER MELTDOWNS.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.091
SHE'S NOT THROWING
STUFF, IS SHE?

01:31.125 --> 01:34.528
NAH, IT'S THE ONE WHERE SHE GOES TO
THE SUPERMARKET IN HER WEDDING DRESS.

01:34.562 --> 01:37.198
I'VE SEEN HER.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.400
GOOD MORNING, PHOEBE.

01:39.433 --> 01:43.204
LENNOX, I HAVE SOME NEWS THAT
IS GONNA MAKE YOU LOVE ME.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.173
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM YOUR SCHOOL

01:45.206 --> 01:47.208
ASKING IF I'D CHAPERONE THE
SCHOOL DANCE ON SATURDAY NIGHT,

01:47.241 --> 01:49.477
AND I REPLIED, "NUH-UH, NOT
MAKING THAT ROOKIE MISTAKE."

01:49.510 --> 01:51.212
PROUD OF ME?

01:51.245 --> 01:53.347
EH.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.149
YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU WANT.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.317
BUT...

01:56.350 --> 01:57.551
WE'RE NOT GOING.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.620
NOBODY ASKED YOU GUYS, HUH?

01:59.653 --> 02:02.290
IT'S JUST THAT THE
10th-GRADE BOYS ARE ALL...

02:02.323 --> 02:03.591
THEY HAVE A WORD
FOR IT IN FRENCH.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.193
LES GEEKS.

02:05.226 --> 02:08.496
WHY DO YOU NEED A DATE? JUST GO WITH EACH
OTHER. I USED TO DO IT ALL THE TIME.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.399
AND WHEN YOU GET TO THE SCHOOL DANCE
YOU JUST SNAKE SOME OTHER GIRL'S DATE.

02:11.432 --> 02:12.600
WHICH IS WRONG.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.603
- ABSOLUTELY WRONG.
- YEAH.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.239
COOL IDEA. WANNA GO
TO THE DANCE WITH ME?

02:18.272 --> 02:20.308
SURE. WANNA GO TO
THE DANCE WITH ME?

02:20.341 --> 02:21.909
- SURE.
- GREAT.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.712
WE BOTH HAVE DATES. AND IF YOU
EVEN THINK OF CHAPERONING,

02:24.745 --> 02:27.215
I WILL CALL CHILD
PROTECTIVE SERVICES.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.685
IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY
CALLED ME STRETCH.

04:11.719 --> 04:14.021
IT WAS IRONIC.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.589
WAS IT?

04:18.091 --> 04:21.629
OH, YOU POOR SWEET CHILD,
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

04:21.662 --> 04:24.698
THE GAY THING.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.300
OH, THAT.

DON'T I STOP WHAT I'M DOING

05:40.474 --> 05:41.609
AND GIVE MY UNDIVIDED
ATTENTION TO YOU?

05:41.642 --> 05:43.644
HOW ABOUT I DO THAT FOR YOU?

05:43.677 --> 05:44.745
THERE'S A HUGE PROBLEM DOWNTOWN.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.815
A LONG-TIME COUNCILMAN HAS
JUST BEEN FORCED TO RESIGN

05:47.848 --> 05:49.717
BECAUSE HE HAD ILLEGAL
DOMESTIC EMPLOYEES.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.385
SO THE CITY ATTORNEY
HAS DEMANDED...

05:51.419 --> 05:53.721
REQUESTED THAT ALL
CITY COUNCIL PEOPLE

05:53.754 --> 05:56.857
SUBMIT PROPER DOCUMENTATION
FOR ALL THEIR, YOU KNOW...

05:57.825 --> 05:59.793
FOR ME?

05:59.827 --> 06:02.663
YEAH, I SNUCK OVER THE
BORDER TO GET THIS JOB.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.433
WHAT, DO THEY THINK I SPENT
15 HOURS IN THE BACK OF A VAN

06:05.466 --> 06:06.834
TO LIVE LIKE A MOLE-MAN
IN YOUR BASEMENT?

06:06.867 --> 06:09.136
I KNOW. IT'S COMPLETELY UNFAIR.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.171
NOBODY'S ASKING THE
MAYOR FOR HIS PAPERS.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.740
IT'S JUST PLAIN WRONG.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.675
THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD'VE
SAID WHEN THEY CALLED ME.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.644
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY BRAVE.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.680
GOD, I ADMIRE WHAT
YOU ALMOST SAID.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.716
- ( phone beeps )
- THE OVEN'S PREHEATED.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.486
AND LISTEN, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, ALL
RIGHT? I WILL GET YOU THE PAPERS.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.688
- SEE? NO PROBLEM.
- WE NEED THEM BY FRIDAY.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.956
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.

06:28.989 --> 06:32.493
PROBLEM? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN, PROBLEM?

06:32.526 --> 06:35.663
ALL RIGHT, 375° IN THE OVEN.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.165
45 MINUTES. AND BACK TO YOU.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.701
PROBLEM? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN, PROBLEM?

06:40.734 --> 06:44.438
I'M JUST NOT EXACTLY SURE WHERE MY
BIRTH CERTIFICATE MIGHT PRECISELY BE.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.440
UH-HUH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.975
WHERE'S YOUR PAPERS?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.977
SUBPOENAED, ALL RIGHT?

06:50.010 --> 06:52.613
ALONG WITH EVERY OTHER PERSONAL AND
PROFESSIONAL DOCUMENT IN MY LIFE.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.649
AFTER A GLOBAL FINANCIAL SCANDAL
AND A LOVELY LITTLE DIVORCE,

06:55.683 --> 06:57.818
MY LIFE HAS BEEN STUFFED INTO
A SERIES OF CARDBOARD BOXES.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.454
IT HAS BEEN SO MUCH FUN.

07:00.488 --> 07:04.525
"OKAY, SO WHERE ARE THOSE BOXES NOW?"
SHE ASKED, CLOSE TO STRANGLING HIM.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.693
ONE OF SIX DIFFERENT PLACES,

07:05.726 --> 07:08.596
IF THEY'RE ANYWHERE AT ALL.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.565
JOE, WHEN THE CITY ATTORNEY
ASKS THE CITY COUNCIL PEOPLE

07:11.599 --> 07:12.933
TO SUBMIT DOCUMENTATION,
THAT'S BIG STUFF.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.635
WHAT THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT?

07:14.668 --> 07:15.736
FIND THEM.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.672
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?
HOW CAN I HELP?

07:18.706 --> 07:20.474
OH MY GOD, I'M FEELING
LIGHT-HEADED.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.210
STEPHANIE, YOU NEED
TO GO LAY DOWN.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.778
YOU HAVE A COUCH AT
YOUR APARTMENT, RIGHT?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.717
I JUST DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU GUYS FIGHT.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.253
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
WHERE YOU GREW UP?

07:33.286 --> 07:35.689
I MEAN, EVEN NEW JERSEY HAS
A DEPARTMENT OF RECORDS.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.691
I'M SURE I CAN JUST
HAVE MY OFFICE CALL

07:37.725 --> 07:39.893
WHATEVER BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
SONG TOWN YOU WERE BORN IN

07:39.927 --> 07:41.929
AND THEY'LL OVERNIGHT
THE RECORDS.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.664
THEN YOU CAN GO BACK
TO YOUR LASAGNA

07:43.697 --> 07:46.634
AND NANNIES-OF-STEEL TRAINING.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.972
FIRST OF ALL, WATCH WHAT YOU
SAY ABOUT JERSEY, OKAY?

07:52.005 --> 07:53.741
AND SECONDLY, I
WASN'T BORN THERE.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.043
FINE. WHAT CITY? WHERE'S
THE PLAQUE THAT SAYS,

07:56.076 --> 07:58.979
"ON THIS SPOT THE MOST ANNOYING
PERSON I KNOW WAS BORN"?

07:59.012 --> 08:02.650
FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I WAS BORN
IN THE PROUD CITY OF UIJEONGBU.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.652
WEE-JAH-WHAT?

08:04.685 --> 08:06.787
IT'S IN KOREA, A
LITTLE NORTH OF SEOUL.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.723
MY DAD WAS MILITARY, AND I WAS BORN
IN AN ARMY HOSPITAL IN UIJEONGBU.

08:09.757 --> 08:13.594
OKAY, YOU WERE BORN IN KOREA, YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY PAPERS AND YOU WORK FOR ME.

08:13.627 --> 08:14.762
OH MY GOD.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.997
I HAVE AN UNDOCUMENTED
KOREAN NANNY.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.801
AS HARD AS THIS MAY BE
FOR YOU TO BELIEVE,

08:20.834 --> 08:23.637
I'M NOT KOREAN.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.840
AND I HAVE MY DOCUMENTS, OKAY?
I JUST DON'T HAVE THEM.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.009
OKAY, LET'S JUST
CALL YOUR MOTHER.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.711
I'M SURE SHE HAS
SOME BACKUP RECORDS.

08:30.744 --> 08:31.645
MY MOM? YEAH.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.782
THE ONLY RECORDS SHE
HAS ARE SONNY & CHER,

08:34.815 --> 08:36.717
MAYBE THE BEE GEES.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.085
JOE, THIS IS SERIOUS, OKAY?

08:38.118 --> 08:40.721
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
YOUR EX-WIFE HAS THEM?

08:40.754 --> 08:45.559
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I'LL CALL TIFFANY,

08:45.593 --> 08:46.927
SEE IF SHE KNOWS.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.697
SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, TRAVELING ABROAD

08:49.730 --> 08:51.565
TO TAHITI OR BARBADOS.
LOOK AT HER,

08:51.599 --> 08:54.301
GOING ALL AROUND THE WORLD, AND
I'M STUCK HERE IN YOUR KITCHEN

08:54.334 --> 08:55.803
SPINNING LETTUCE.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.905
MY JOB IS KIND OF AT STAKE HERE.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.808
SO COULD YOU GIVE ME A
SLIVER OF HOPE OF SOMETHING?

09:00.841 --> 09:04.778
THAT MIGHT BE THE BEST
LASAGNA I'VE EVER MADE.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.590
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BELIEVE THIS.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.959
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS.
GET READY TO NOT BELIEVE THIS.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.662
WOW, LOOK AT YOU ALL FIRED UP.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.664
YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE ME.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.999
HEY YOU, YOU'RE GONNA
WANT TO HEAR THIS TOO.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.101
PRINCIPAL LUNT HAS DECIDED
THAT PHOEBE AND I

09:28.135 --> 09:30.003
CANNOT ATTEND SATURDAY'S
DANCE AS A GAY COUPLE.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.705
HA!

09:31.739 --> 09:33.941
THAT WAS A LAUGH OF
POLITICAL OUTRAGE.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.009
OH, I'M GONNA FIGHT THIS.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.712
THEY HAVE MESSED WITH
THE WRONG LESBIAN.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.815
YEAH, THE STRAIGHT ONE.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.717
COME ON, LENNOX.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.753
IT'S BEEN A MONTH WITH NO PHONE
CALLS FROM YOUR PRINCIPAL.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.120
KEEP THE STREAK ALIVE.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.389
I AM FIGHTING FOR MY GAY RIGHTS.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.124
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY GAY RIGHTS

09:51.158 --> 09:53.761
UNTIL YOU EXPERIMENT IN COLLEGE.

09:56.697 --> 10:01.168
IS THIS REALLY THE HILL
THAT YOU WANT TO DIE ON?

10:01.201 --> 10:02.970
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU GUYS ON?

10:03.003 --> 10:06.606
THE SIDE THAT KEEPS ME OFF
YOUR PRINCIPAL'S SPEED-DIAL.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.743
UGH!

10:09.777 --> 10:11.779
WOW, SHE'S SO MILITANT.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.747
THANKS FOR BEING ON
MY SIDE JUST THEN.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.115
SURE. IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO,

10:15.148 --> 10:16.950
SORT OF MAKES US FOR WHAT
HAPPENED THIS AFTERNOON.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.386
GO ON.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.388
ALL RIGHT, A
REPORTER CORNERED ME

10:21.421 --> 10:23.190
WHEN I WAS AT THE
SUPERMARKET EARLIER TODAY.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.025
ANYWAY, HE KNEW THAT
I WORKED FOR YOU,

10:25.058 --> 10:27.828
KNEW I HADN'T FILED MY PAPERS...
A LITTLE WEASELY GUY IN A TIE.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.663
NOT JERRY DEVINE.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.665
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.434
ANYWAY, HE COMES UP TO
ME, HE SAYS, YOU KNOW,

10:34.467 --> 10:36.704
"WHAT ARE YOU COVERING UP?
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE AN AMERICAN."

10:36.737 --> 10:39.072
AND I'M LIKE, "OH REALLY? YOU CAN TELL
I'M AMERICAN JUST BY LOOKING AT ME?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.808
WELL, GUESS WHAT. I'M
FROM KOREA, PAL.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.342
HOW ABOUT THAT, YOU
MOUTHY FRAUD?"

10:42.375 --> 10:45.779
I ACTUALLY SAID SOMETHING A BIT
STRONGER, BUT IT HAD THE SAME INITIALS.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.448
OKAY, JERRY HAS A
COLUMN EVERY FRIDAY.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.083
HE'S GONNA TEAR ME APART.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.820
WHY DON'T YOU JUST BURN A
FLAG WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?

10:52.853 --> 10:55.088
I GOT A LITTLE HOT. WHAT
WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

10:55.122 --> 10:57.725
STAND THERE QUIETLY
AND LOOK AMERICAN.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.793
RELAX, ALL RIGHT?
THERE'S GOOD NEWS TOO.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.930
TIFFANY GETS BACK IN THE MORNING AND
SHE'S SENDING OVER THE FILE BOXES.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.832
THE ONES THAT CONTAIN
YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE

11:04.865 --> 11:06.767
AND YOUR PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP AND
EVERYTHING THAT SAYS YOU'RE LEGAL?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.936
ABSOLUTELY.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.771
VERY LIKELY.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.874
FINGERS CROSSED.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.911
DUANE, YOU'LL HAVE MR.
LONGO'S DOCUMENTS

11:17.945 --> 11:19.713
IN YOUR HAND TOMORROW
WITHOUT FAIL.

11:19.747 --> 11:20.881
PLEASURE AS ALWAYS,

11:20.914 --> 11:23.183
YOU SCUM-SUCKING LEECH.

11:23.216 --> 11:26.053
WOW, YOU HANDLED THAT WITHOUT
EVEN BREAKING A SWEAT.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.155
I NEED A DRY BLOUSE.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.158
WELL, OUR CITY ATTORNEY
HAS JUST INFORMED ME

11:31.191 --> 11:34.728
THAT I AM THE ONLY REMAINING COUNCILPERSON
THAT HAS YET TO FILE PAPERS.

11:34.762 --> 11:35.829
YOU'RE KIND OF LIKE A REBEL.

11:35.863 --> 11:39.266
YEAH, A REBEL WITHOUT A JOB.
THIS IS GETTING SERIOUS.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.269
WELL, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF
WE CAN'T FIND JOE'S PAPERS?

11:42.302 --> 11:44.738
WELL, I'D HATE TO HAVE TO...

11:44.772 --> 11:46.006
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE HE'S...

11:46.039 --> 11:47.808
AND THE KIDS REALLY...

11:47.841 --> 11:49.209
AND EVEN I...

11:49.242 --> 11:51.178
I HATE THIS.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.146
I MEAN, I KNOW JOE'S
THE GREATEST,

11:53.180 --> 11:56.917
BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT
DON'T YOU HAVE TO...

11:56.950 --> 11:59.019
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN...

11:59.052 --> 12:02.756
YOU CAN PRACTICE
BY FAKE-FIRING ME.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.925
OKAY, I'LL TRY.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.795
STEPHANIE, THIS IS NOT AN
EASY CONVERSATION TO HAVE.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.764
OH MY GOD!

12:10.798 --> 12:13.867
THANKS. THANKS. THAT
WAS SUPER HELPFUL.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.909
- JOE.
- KITCHEN.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.813
( exhales )

12:29.216 --> 12:30.784
LOOK WHAT JUST GOT HERE.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.786
YOUR FILES! THIS IS GREAT.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.823
OH, NOW I DON'T HAVE TO...
DO ANYTHING ELSE.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.791
THEY'RE PRETTY
DISORGANIZED THOUGH.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.861
WHO CARES? WE'LL GO THROUGH THEM ALL.
HOW LONG COULD IT TAKE?

12:40.894 --> 12:43.931
FROM THE WAY YOU WERE TALKING, I
WAS EXPECTING A WHOLE LOT MORE.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.099
( chuckles )

12:48.969 --> 12:52.172
HOLY SON OF A BOX,
DOES THIS END?

12:52.205 --> 12:54.842
HEY, AUNT MEL, I'M ALREADY
ON MY SECOND BOX.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.577
I ZIPPED THROUGH THIS FIRST
ONE IN, LIKE, HALF AN HOUR.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.880
WE'LL NEVER GET THROUGH
ALL THESE BY TOMORROW.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.816
LOOK, IF WE ALL PITCH IN,
WE CAN TOTALLY DO THIS.

13:02.850 --> 13:03.817
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

13:03.851 --> 13:06.253
WELL...

13:06.286 --> 13:08.355
I'LL TAKE THIS PILE.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.324
THAT'S WHY I LOVE WORKING FOR YOUR AUNT.
SHE STICKS UP FOR PEOPLE.

13:11.358 --> 13:15.228
YEP, I'M A STICKER-UPPER.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.044
ALL RIGHT, THIS ONE'S DONE.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.085
BURKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I
JUST SAID THAT ONE WAS DONE.

13:38.118 --> 13:42.389
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SLIDING 'EM
OVER TO ME SO I COULD DO 'EM.

13:42.422 --> 13:46.026
WHAT? NO, I'VE BEEN SLIDING THEM OVER
TO YOU BECAUSE I'M DONE WITH THEM.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.995
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE A BIG
RED CHECK MARK ON THEM.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.864
I THOUGHT THE CHECK MEANT,
"HEY, CHECK THIS BOX OUT."

13:50.898 --> 13:53.934
I JUST DID THIS WHOLE
PILE FOR NOTHING?

13:56.904 --> 13:59.940
OH, LENNOX BABY.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.209
COME ON, GO TO BED. GO TO BED.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.345
I HAVE PAPER CUTS ON MY FACE.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.650
I LASTED LONGER THAN RYDER.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.154
YES, YOU DID. YOU DID
A GOOD GOOD JOB.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.623
- HERE IT IS.
- FANTASTIC.

14:16.656 --> 14:19.159
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR
THIS THING FOR 20 YEARS.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.262
THIS IS A PICTURE OF FIVE SCRAWNY
BOYS ROASTING MARSHMALLOWS.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.998
YEAH, ME AND MY BUNKMATES FROM
CAMP ARROWHEAD, CABIN 12.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.901
LENNY SHILCOP RIGHT THERE COULD
TURN HIS EYELIDS INSIDE OUT.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.937
THOSE WERE GOOD TIMES.

14:29.970 --> 14:33.406
I NEED TO GO HOME AND GIVE
MY DAD A SPONGE BATH.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.944
HE'S NOT SICK, JUST LAZY.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.884
SO ARE YOU GOING TO, YOU KNOW...

14:45.986 --> 14:48.922
I HOPE HE TAKES IT
BETTER THAN I DID.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.992
HAVE FUN CLEANING YOUR DAD.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.466
- JOE.
- YEAH, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR AGAIN?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.935
YOUR PROOF OF
CITIZENSHIP PAPERS.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.271
YES, ABSOLUTELY. GOOD. OKAY.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.473
UM, LISTEN, JOE, IT'S...

15:06.506 --> 15:09.476
THIS IS NOT AN EASY
CONVERSATION TO HAVE...

15:09.509 --> 15:12.079
I GOT 'EM! I GOT 'EM!
I FOUND YOUR PAPERS.

15:12.112 --> 15:15.148
- I'M LEGAL.
- AND YOU'VE GOT THE CUTEST LITTLE FOOTPRINT.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.683
- WHERE DID YOU FIND THESE?
- I LOOKED OUT MY WINDOW

15:16.716 --> 15:19.219
AND I SPOTTED A BOX LEFT
OUT ON THE DRIVEWAY.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.254
RYDER, I COULD KISS YOU.
I WILL KISS YOU.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.990
HEY HEY, BACK UP.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.059
OKAY, A HUG.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.130
ALL RIGHT. TAKE THAT,
REPORTER SCUM.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.199
TAKE THAT, CITY ATTORNEY WEASEL.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.733
YEAH, TAKE THAT
DOWN TO CITY HALL.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.703
YES. YES. GOING. GOOD.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.072
GO GET READY FOR SCHOOL, DUDE.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.975
YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE ON NO SLEEP?
IS THAT SAFE?

15:42.009 --> 15:45.178
WE'VE GOT AIRBAGS, MAN.
THEY'RE LIKE BIG PILLOWS.

15:46.213 --> 15:50.717
( phone buzzes )

15:50.750 --> 15:53.086
HELLO. HEY MOM, HOW ARE YA?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.154
OH, LISTEN, MOM, GREAT NEWS.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.323
YOU KNOW THE DOCUMENTS I
NEED YOU TO FIND FOR ME?

15:56.356 --> 15:59.392
WELL, YOU DON'T NEED TO LOOK ANY
FURTHER 'CAUSE WE FOUND THEM. YEAH.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.261
WHAT?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.130
( knocks on door )

16:03.163 --> 16:04.264
ONE SECOND.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.537
COME IN.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.106
HEY BUDDY, WHAT'S GOING ON, HUH?

16:13.140 --> 16:14.474
WHAT'S NEW IN YOUR WORLD?

16:14.507 --> 16:18.545
WHATCHA BEEN PRINTING LATELY?

16:18.578 --> 16:20.313
NOTHING.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.415
JOE, SHOULDN'T WE
BE GOING TO SCHOOL?

16:22.449 --> 16:25.452
FUNNIEST THING, YOU KNOW... I WAS
TALKING TO MY MOM THE OTHER DAY

16:25.485 --> 16:28.421
AND I TOLD HER IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT I FIND MY CITIZENSHIP DOCUMENT.

16:28.455 --> 16:32.359
AND GUESS WHAT SHE FOUND THIS MORNING
IN HER GARAGE NEXT TO HER OLD 45s?

16:32.392 --> 16:34.427
YOUR MOM HAS GUNS?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.329
YES, SHE DOES.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.065
BUT I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE PAPER.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.568
SHE FOUND IT... THE ONLY COPY.
AND IT'LL BE HERE TOMORROW.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.470
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SURPRISE

16:43.503 --> 16:46.406
WHEN YOU JUST FOUND SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXIST.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.475
( laughing )

16:51.478 --> 16:54.581
YEAH, WHAT'S THIS?

16:54.614 --> 16:57.050
WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.486
WOW, THIS MUST BE ONE
OF THE EARLIER DRAFTS.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.456
SEEMS LIKE THIS ONE WAS ISSUED BY
THE GREAT STATE OF NOW JERSEY.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.558
I HAVE TO GO STOP THIS.

17:05.592 --> 17:09.329
YOUR AUNT COULD GET IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
FOR PASSING FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS, DUDE.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.464
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.301
LOOK, I KNOW THIS CAME
FROM A GOOD PLACE, OKAY?

17:14.334 --> 17:16.569
AND IT ACTUALLY MEANS THE WORLD
TO ME THAT YOU DID THIS 'CAUSE...

17:16.603 --> 17:18.471
YEAH. GO SAVE HER, ALL RIGHT?

17:18.505 --> 17:20.373
WELL, I... OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.213
GOOD MORNING.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.449
GENTLEMEN, LADIES, COUNCILWOMAN
BURKE AND THE CITY ATTORNEY

17:29.482 --> 17:31.384
HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
FOR ALL OF YOU.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.620
I AM PLEASED TO FINALLY BE
HANDING OVER THESE DOCUMENTS

17:33.653 --> 17:37.290
TO OUR CITY ATTORNEY, CERTIFYING
THAT MY DOMESTIC EMPLOYEE,

17:37.324 --> 17:39.626
WHO IS HERE RIGHT
NOW STRANGELY...

17:39.659 --> 17:41.228
HI.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.529
JOE.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.598
THE NANNY.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.867
HOW YOU GUYS DOING?

17:47.900 --> 17:51.238
THERE IS OF COURSE NO NEED
FOR HIM TO ACTUALLY BE HERE.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.373
I TRIED TO CALL YOUR CELL
PHONE, BUT IT WAS TURNED OFF.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.874
- A VERY BAD TIME.
- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.544
YES, SO IS THIS. THAT'S
WHY THERE'S CAMERAS HERE.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.446
THE KIDS KNEW HOW DESPERATE
I WAS TO FIND MY PAPERS...

17:59.479 --> 18:00.613
OKAY, REDUCE IT TO THREE WORDS.

18:00.647 --> 18:04.351
RYDER, PHOTOSHOP, FELONY.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.254
GOT IT.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.589
BURKE, I GOT MEETINGS. CAN WE
JUST TAKE THE PICTURES AND GO?

18:09.622 --> 18:13.893
AND ALTHOUGH THESE PAPERS PROVE
BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT

18:13.926 --> 18:18.131
THE LEGALITY OF MY ESTEEMED
EMPLOYEE, JOSEPH LONGO, AMERICAN...

18:18.165 --> 18:20.400
- WHERE ARE WE GOING WITH THIS?
- ANYBODY'S GUESS.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.670
...I OBJECT TO SINGLING OUT
A FEW HARD-WORKING PEOPLE

18:23.703 --> 18:26.573
WHOSE ONLY REAL TRANSGRESSION IS
THEIR LACK OF POLITICAL CLOUT.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.542
TURNING IN THESE PAPERS WOULD
BE CAPITULATING TO UNFAIRNESS.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.544
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME
THE PAPERS, ARE YOU?

18:31.578 --> 18:33.380
THIS IS WHERE YOU
GIVE HIM THE PAPERS.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.548
I SAY NO WAY IN HECK.

18:35.582 --> 18:40.387
YOU WILL NEVER GET THESE PAPERS.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.555
DON'T MAKE ME SUBPOENA YOUR BRA.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.425
I WILL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS NOW.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.161
IS IT TRUE YOUR NIECE IS BANNED
FROM THE GRANT HIGH SCHOOL DANCE

18:48.195 --> 18:50.297
BECAUSE SHE IS PART
OF A GAY COUPLE?

18:50.330 --> 18:52.499
WHAT?

18:52.532 --> 18:55.602
IF YOUR NIECE MARRIES THIS GIRL,
WILL YOU ATTEND THE WEDDING?

18:55.635 --> 18:58.438
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED TO ASK?
THIS IS WHY YOU'RE ALL HERE?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.573
- YES.
- OH, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.542
NONE OF YOU CARE ABOUT THIS
WHOLE CITIZENSHIP THING?

19:02.575 --> 19:04.911
OLD NEWS. IF YOUR NIECE AND
HER WIFE HAVE CHILDREN,

19:04.944 --> 19:06.579
WILL THEY BE WELCOME
IN YOUR HOME?

19:06.613 --> 19:08.381
OH, THIS IS IDIOTIC.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.283
ALL RIGHT, LENNOX IS NOT GAY.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.623
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE LOVE
HER ANY LESS THOUGH.

19:18.591 --> 19:22.595
LOOK, BURKE, I'M GONNA
NEED THIS GUY'S PAPERS.

19:22.629 --> 19:25.432
THOSE AREN'T REAL...

19:25.465 --> 19:26.399
THE PAPERS.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.436
YOU'LL HAVE THE REAL
ONES IN THE MORNING.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.538
TOMORROW MORNING?

19:31.571 --> 19:33.673
YOU KNOW WHAT? I COULD
PROBABLY MAKE THAT WORK.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.676
YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.549
HEY, I AM SORRY THAT
MY MESSY PERSONAL LIFE

19:42.582 --> 19:44.217
CAUSED YOU SO MUCH
TROUBLE HERE AT WORK.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.519
THAT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW,
WHAT REALLY GOT ME UPSET

19:46.553 --> 19:49.656
WAS THE THOUGHT OF LOSING YOU...
YOUTH VOTES.

19:49.689 --> 19:53.226
YEAH, YOU KNOW, FOR THE
THE REELECTION NEXT YEAR.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.628
YEAH, NO, THE YOUTH VOTE
COULD BE VERY FICKLE.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.330
