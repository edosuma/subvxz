00:07.966 --> 00:09.176
Hey, Otis!

00:09.259 --> 00:11.094
-Otis
-Otis!

00:11.178 --> 00:14.306
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:14.389 --> 00:15.641
Hit the brakes!

00:15.724 --> 00:17.559
-Otis
-Otis!

00:17.643 --> 00:20.729
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:20.812 --> 00:21.897
Let's get rolling!

00:21.980 --> 00:24.900
Together on the farm
We play and we work hard

00:24.983 --> 00:28.111
-With help from Otis the tractor
-Yeah!

00:28.195 --> 00:31.365
When he feels his heart glowing
Otis gets going

00:31.448 --> 00:34.576
-So let's get rolling with Otis
-Otis!

00:37.704 --> 00:38.956
"Jumping Daisy."

00:54.930 --> 00:57.307
Good morning, Long Hill Dairy Farm.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.101
Do you hear that sound?

00:59.184 --> 01:01.728
It's the hooves of the best horses around.

01:03.272 --> 01:08.443
I'm Farmer Nelson, and welcome
to our horse jumping competition.

01:08.527 --> 01:11.196
-Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo!
-All right.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.449
This is so exciting.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.746
-They jump so high.
-Yeah.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.332
Look at those horsies
hopping in this heat.

01:23.792 --> 01:27.588
Which horse will jump the high jump
and get the blue ribbon?

01:27.671 --> 01:29.131
We'll soon find out.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.884
I don't know if anyone can jump over that.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.219
-I know someone who can.
-You do?

01:34.303 --> 01:35.470
-Who?
-Who, Otis?

01:36.054 --> 01:37.347
It's me!

01:37.431 --> 01:39.850
-Daisy!
-Whoo-moo!

01:39.933 --> 01:42.936
-That's my girl.
-Thanks, Mama.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.647
Daisy, Daisy, you jump so high.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.483
Someday soon you'll touch the sky.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.612
It's hot today.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.739
I'll cool you off, Daisy.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.532
Thanks, Celeste.

01:58.202 --> 01:59.620
Look!

01:59.703 --> 02:00.913
There she is.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.624
Sweet Susie.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.294
She's my favorite jumper.

02:08.377 --> 02:09.880
Then let's go meet her.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.633
Okay.

02:16.512 --> 02:17.679
Sweet Susie?

02:18.263 --> 02:21.099
That's my name.
What's yours, little tractor?

02:21.183 --> 02:25.771
I'm Otis. And this is my friend Daisy.
She's a jumper too.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.858
-Well, hello there, Daisy.
-Hi.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.486
I've never met a jumping calf before.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.197
She can jump higher than anyone I know.

02:37.908 --> 02:41.078
I've got the moo-ves.

02:43.205 --> 02:46.792
Well, I cannot wait to see
more of your moo-ves, Daisy.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.838
It's hotter than hotcakes out here.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.173
Make sure you stay cool, okay?

02:54.925 --> 02:57.594
I will. Thanks, Sweet Susie.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.057
Did you see that, Mama?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.976
I talked to Sweet Susie.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.728
I sure did.

03:06.812 --> 03:11.108
Okay, horses. It's time for the next jump.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.238
Let's go, Daisy, dear.
It's almost your turn.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.489
You ready?

03:18.156 --> 03:20.701
I was born ready, Otis.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.745
Daisy, Daisy, you jump so high.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.123
Someday soon you'll touch the--

03:29.626 --> 03:31.461
I'm so hot.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.005
Hit the brakes!

03:33.881 --> 03:35.507
Are you okay, Daisy?

03:36.091 --> 03:39.553
Daisy, dear. I don't know
if you should jump in this heat.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.681
But, Mama, that makes me really sad.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.813
Daisy has to jump. But how can I help?

03:57.863 --> 03:58.947
Daisy, Daisy.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.911
What if I got some water to cool you off?

04:03.994 --> 04:05.662
Yes, please.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.664
Let's get rolling to help.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.506
It's empty.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.638
Water. Water.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.267
Gotta find some…

04:30.771 --> 04:31.855
Water!

04:31.939 --> 04:33.315
My water tank.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.570
I'm coming, jumping Daisy.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.951
There's enough water for all of you now.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.370
You did it, Otis.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.088
That's better.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.590
Thanks, Otis.

04:59.299 --> 05:03.095
Now I'm ready to jump higher
than all the other horses.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.055
Jump! Jump!

05:05.889 --> 05:07.099
Jump!

05:09.476 --> 05:12.312
Daisy, dear. You're covered in mud.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.773
Let's go get you cleaned up.

05:14.857 --> 05:18.318
But, Mama, I can't miss
the high jump competition.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.904
Don't you worry.
We'll be quickety quick.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.531
All right.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.408
Be right back, Otis.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.327
Okay. But hurry.

05:31.790 --> 05:35.043
There we are. All clean and ready to jump.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.301
That's strange.

05:45.554 --> 05:48.015
I can't open the door.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.435
But I have to get
to the high jump competition.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.980
Otis? Celeste?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.106
Sal?

05:57.149 --> 05:59.693
Otis!

06:00.194 --> 06:04.281
Get ready, 'cause it's high time
for the high jump.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.825
-Cock-a-doodle-do!
-I can't wait!

06:06.909 --> 06:09.578
Oh, no. That's Daisy's event.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.497
She should've been back by now.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.833
I gotta go find her.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.715
Otis!

06:22.341 --> 06:23.592
Hit the brakes.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.179
Otis!

06:27.262 --> 06:28.889
That's Daisy.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.807
I'm coming, Daisy!

06:36.188 --> 06:38.440
Daisy, are you in there?

06:38.524 --> 06:39.900
Yes, Otis.

06:40.651 --> 06:43.820
The door is stuck. We're trapped inside.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.448
I've gotta get out of here, Otis.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.034
I'm worried
I'm gonna miss the competition.

06:56.834 --> 07:01.004
There must be something I can do
to get Daisy and Rosalie out of there.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.007
Maybe if I push really hard?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.926
Please try, Otis.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.971
Okay. Let's get rolling.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.895
I can't push the door in.

07:21.984 --> 07:24.152
And we can't push the door out.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.408
If I can't get the door open…

07:31.702 --> 07:33.787
I bet I can take it off.

07:33.871 --> 07:39.376
Stand back, Daisy and Rosalie.
I'm taking the door off this barn, okay?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.627
Yes.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.339
We're ready, Otis.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.973
Maybe I can use my winch to pull it off.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.941
Nope. There's nothing to hook on to.

08:05.611 --> 08:06.737
I know.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.240
I can use my forklift
to lift the door off.

08:16.622 --> 08:20.209
You can do this.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.754
Go, Otis, go!

08:23.837 --> 08:25.672
You got this, Otis!

08:29.468 --> 08:31.345
Otis, you did it.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.804
You got us out.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.890
-Whoo-moo!
-Amazing.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.977
You're such a hearty helper, Otis.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.106
Thank you.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.525
You're welcome.

08:44.608 --> 08:48.111
Next up,
Sweet Susie will do the high jump.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.533
We've gotta get you to the competition,
Daisy.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.540
Looks like Sweet Susie's the only one

08:59.623 --> 09:01.500
who wants to do the high jump.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.377
She's approaching the hurdle.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.588
She jumps, and--

09:06.672 --> 09:07.840
Oh, no!

09:08.841 --> 09:12.302
Looks like this jump is just too high.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.976
All right, folks. The competition's over.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.187
Unless anyone else wants to give it a try?

09:22.980 --> 09:24.690
Whoo-moo!

09:24.773 --> 09:26.191
What's this?

09:27.442 --> 09:29.152
Jump, Daisy, jump!

09:29.236 --> 09:32.698
Here I come!

09:33.991 --> 09:36.243
Go, Daisy!

09:36.910 --> 09:39.121
Folks, it's not over yet.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.457
We have one last jumper
in the competition.

09:42.541 --> 09:45.752
And it's not a horse. It's a calf.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.463
-Oink-cellent.
-Cock-a-doodle-go-Daisy!

09:48.547 --> 09:50.215
You can do it.

09:54.469 --> 09:55.762
Could it be?

09:55.846 --> 09:59.099
Is this calf going to jump the high jump?

09:59.183 --> 10:02.102
Daisy, Daisy, you jump so high.

10:02.186 --> 10:05.147
Someday soon you'll touch the sky!

10:12.029 --> 10:13.864
Jump, Daisy, jump!

10:14.907 --> 10:17.201
Whoo-moo!

10:19.870 --> 10:20.913
She did it!

10:22.247 --> 10:23.248
Go, Daisy!

10:23.332 --> 10:24.833
Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo!

10:24.917 --> 10:27.711
Daisy jumped higher than all the horses.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.838
For the first time ever,

10:29.922 --> 10:33.050
a cow has won the high jump competition.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.676
Let's hear it for Daisy.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.844
Yeah, Daisy!

10:35.928 --> 10:39.640
-Did you see my Daisy's moo-ves?
-You did it.

10:39.723 --> 10:43.227
I had no idea my favorite little calf
could jump so high.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.645
Congratulations.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.524
Jumping Daisy. I'm so proud of you.

10:51.443 --> 10:54.279
Those were some sweet jumps.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.617
How would you like to practice
jumping together sometime?

10:59.326 --> 11:00.953
Yes! Yes!

11:02.162 --> 11:03.497
That's a yes for me.

11:05.791 --> 11:08.794
Hopping hay bales, you did it, Daisy!

11:08.877 --> 11:12.005
I did. I did!

11:12.881 --> 11:15.133
I'm so proud of myself.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.595
Thanks for helping me today, Otis.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.014
You really are a hearty helper.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.394
On this farm, we all help each other.

11:25.477 --> 11:26.895
Whoo-moo!

11:27.688 --> 11:29.815
-Moo!
-Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo!

11:30.524 --> 11:32.067
I knew you could do it.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.610
I'm so proud of you.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.195
Daisy for the win.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.784
"Polly and the Skunk."

11:56.383 --> 11:57.926
Hiya, Polly-pup.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.054
Sure, we can play.

12:01.138 --> 12:04.892
But first I have to take these tomatoes
to the compost pile.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.819
No, Polly. We can't eat them.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.154
They're all cracked.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.407
But they sure smell good.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.828
Yep. Now we can play.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.581
Come on.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.090
Go get the ball, Polly.
I'm right behind you.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.139
You wanna play with everyone?

12:45.724 --> 12:46.934
Okay.

12:48.227 --> 12:49.228
Whoo-moo.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.063
-Yeah.
-Otis.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.773
Who wants to play with Polly?

12:53.941 --> 12:55.275
I cock-a-doodle-do.

12:55.359 --> 12:56.568
Me too!

12:56.652 --> 12:58.362
Me three.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.241
Uh-oh.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.117
Yeah!

13:05.285 --> 13:08.205
All righty. Polly ball it is.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.873
Let's go to the hayfield.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.333
I can't wait to play.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.418
-I love Polly ball.
-Come on.

13:13.502 --> 13:16.964
Polly ball, Polly ball,
our favorite game to play.

13:17.631 --> 13:21.176
Bounce the ball up and down
and keep it in the hay!

13:21.260 --> 13:22.427
-Yeah!
-Let's do this.

13:22.511 --> 13:23.762
-I'm ready.
-Let's play.

13:25.681 --> 13:29.393
Polly ball, Polly ball,
our favorite game to play.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.687
Bounce the ball up and down

13:31.770 --> 13:33.188
and keep it in the hay!

13:33.939 --> 13:35.649
Coming baa-ack at you.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.571
Yes! Good one.

13:47.244 --> 13:50.205
And the ball is…

13:52.082 --> 13:54.293
O-O-O-Out.

13:55.169 --> 13:57.296
-Break time.
-I think I see it over there.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.630
-Thanks, Polly.
-Hurry baa-ack.

14:27.201 --> 14:30.037
Polly, do you need help finding the ball?

14:33.248 --> 14:34.249
There you are.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.251
-Back to the game.
-Welcome back.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.484
What is that smell?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.903
It smells baa-ad.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.446
Like a skunk.

15:10.994 --> 15:14.623
Jeepers sheepers, Polly.
Did you get sprayed by a skunk?

15:19.169 --> 15:20.379
Smelly.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.763
Pee-ew.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.642
I'm sorry, Polly.

15:33.725 --> 15:38.063
I wanna play with you,
but that skunky smell is just way too bad.

15:39.815 --> 15:42.484
I guess we can't play together today.

15:42.568 --> 15:43.986
Sorry, Polly.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.371
Hit the brakes.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.707
Polly, are you okay?

16:03.005 --> 16:05.799
You're sad because
you can't play with everyone.

16:08.051 --> 16:11.221
What can I use
to cover that skunky smell?

16:11.889 --> 16:15.350
I just need to use the gears
between my ears.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.816
Maybe if we cover you in these flowers

16:24.193 --> 16:26.236
we can all play with you again.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.113
How does that sound, Polly?

16:30.115 --> 16:31.909
-We can help.
-I can pick some.

16:31.992 --> 16:32.993
Me too.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.453
Let's get rolling.

16:41.793 --> 16:45.088
This one can go right here.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.052
We're gonna need a lot more.

16:50.636 --> 16:53.013
-Aha.
-Here's a whole bunch.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.307
I found some more.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.351
This should do the trick.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.729
Polly's gonna smell so good.

17:01.230 --> 17:03.315
-One more here.
-A little over here.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.275
Let me just add this.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.693
And done.

17:09.279 --> 17:12.824
Polly, you smell like flowers now.
We did it.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.161
I think this is gonna work.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.002
Let's play…

17:25.127 --> 17:29.007
Polly ball, Polly ball,
our favorite game to play.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.843
Bounce the ball up and down

17:30.926 --> 17:33.220
and keep it in the hay!

17:33.303 --> 17:34.847
-Let's go.
-Over here.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.480
Heads up.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.859
Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.411
Uh-oh.

17:57.494 --> 18:00.038
Go, Polly. Go, go, go.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.166
Oh, no. The flowers.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.339
The smell is back.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.466
'Cause all the flowers fell off.

18:11.550 --> 18:15.137
I'm sorry, Polly. I can't get any closer.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.389
This is not working.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.519
Hit the brakes.

18:27.691 --> 18:30.611
Oh, Polly. I know you're upset.

18:31.570 --> 18:34.448
Putt, puff, puttedy chuff,

18:34.531 --> 18:37.492
we'll figure this out, Polly-pup.

18:38.869 --> 18:43.457
What game can we play together
without being too close to Polly?

18:46.877 --> 18:48.045
That's it!

18:48.128 --> 18:49.963
Polly, wanna play catch?

18:50.047 --> 18:52.216
Then we can play but be far apart.

18:56.512 --> 18:59.723
Okay. Ready, Polly? Catch!

19:03.936 --> 19:05.604
This is more like it.

19:05.687 --> 19:06.688
Throw it back.

19:09.942 --> 19:11.276
Got it. Catch!

19:12.736 --> 19:14.863
Oops. Not far enough.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.745
No, no, no, no, no.

19:27.501 --> 19:31.547
The ball's too close to Polly,
and the skunky smell is back.

19:33.382 --> 19:35.634
-Oh, no.
-So smelly.

19:38.971 --> 19:40.013
My beak.

19:40.097 --> 19:42.307
-No.
-Too close.

19:43.392 --> 19:44.601
Run.

19:44.685 --> 19:45.686
Run.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.565
Sorry, Polly.

19:49.648 --> 19:53.527
We wanna play together too.
But I don't think we can.

19:55.821 --> 19:57.322
Polly, wait.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.120
We gotta find a way to play with Polly.

20:08.834 --> 20:09.835
Polly.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.964
How about just the two of us play?

20:29.605 --> 20:30.814
Oops.

20:37.696 --> 20:40.824
If only Polly could smell
like these tomatoes.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.368
Wait. That's it.

20:43.452 --> 20:44.703
Hey, everyone.

20:45.412 --> 20:48.832
Maybe Polly would smell like
these tomatoes if we play in them.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.669
-Those smell good.
-Yeah. Great idea.

20:57.674 --> 21:00.844
Let's get rolling in these tomatoes.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.684
Hey, Polly-pup. Wanna play ball?

21:10.479 --> 21:13.065
-Come on.
-Tomatoes, here I come.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.401
-Yeah!
-Whoo-moo!

21:16.485 --> 21:19.530
Let me in those squishy, mushy tomatoes.

21:19.613 --> 21:22.699
A squashy-squashy-squish.
A squashy-squashy-squish.

21:22.783 --> 21:24.535
A squashy-squashy-squish.

21:24.618 --> 21:26.537
Pass me the ball, Polly.

21:30.791 --> 21:33.710
Hey. I don't smell
the skunky smell anymore.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.171
I don't either.

21:37.089 --> 21:39.591
The tomatoes took away the smell.

21:39.675 --> 21:41.385
You did it, Otis.

21:44.054 --> 21:46.098
Now we can all play together.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.562
Whoo-moo!

22:05.617 --> 22:07.327
You're welcome, Polly-pup.

22:07.411 --> 22:09.538
I'm happy we got to play together too.

22:12.708 --> 22:15.419
Otis, you're such a hearty helper.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.130
On this farm, we all help each other.

22:19.506 --> 22:23.260
Polly ball, Polly ball,
our favorite game to play.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.512
Bounce the ball up and down and--

22:25.596 --> 22:28.849
Keep it in the toma-toes.
