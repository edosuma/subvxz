Ah, the Grace monster!

00:49.091 --> 00:50.301
No!

00:51.802 --> 00:53.971

00:54.263 --> 00:55.556
No.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.058
So?

00:57.349 --> 00:59.268
When it's like this,
it's not food.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.880
Hi, baby.
Coffee's on the counter.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.688
- Thank you.
- Um...

01:02.980 --> 01:04.607
can you help us
with a situation?

01:04.899 --> 01:05.900
What's the matter?

01:06.192 --> 01:07.512
Daddy didn't make
the toast right.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.028
He cut it into little squares.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.322
It's supposed to be
into triangles.

01:11.614 --> 01:14.992
Ah. Let me see what I can do.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.702

See? What do you think?

01:27.546 --> 01:29.048
And that's why
you're the mommy.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.467
- Breakfast?
- I don't have any time.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.553
Mommy, you have to be
nutritious.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.473
You're so right. Mmm.

Mommy! Don't go.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.155
- Why can't you stay home and play with me?
- Gracie.

Gracie, baby,
we talked about this.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.243

Take my tubing.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.586

05:37.796 --> 05:39.214
All right, little to the left.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.216

- Come on, stay still.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.209
You can hold my arm,
but you can't wiggle.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.273
- It hurts.
- Whoa.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.446
You want to get done,
don't you? Deep breaths.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.338
Now, just hold
the probe in place

06:04.448 --> 06:06.488

<i>I started my junior year
at Texas A&M</i>

08:13.494 --> 08:14.912
<i>the way most
college students do:</i>

08:15.204 --> 08:17.456
<i>wondering how I'd make

08:20.918 --> 08:22.187
- Yeah.
- Why don't you have a water bottle.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.211
Thank you.

08:23.295 --> 08:24.895
Are you familiar with
Planned Parenthood?

08:25.172 --> 08:27.292
I've heard of it. It's
a women's health clinic, right?

08:27.508 --> 08:29.510
That's right.
Our clinics are very important

08:29.801 --> 08:32.095
to our clients who depend on us
for birth control,

08:32.386 --> 08:33.722
or abortions if they need them.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.767
Um, I don't know
how I feel about abortion.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.019
My family is pro-life,
so I guess I am, too.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.354
Oh, I totally understand.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.772
But at Planned Parenthood,

08:42.063 --> 08:43.941
our goal is
to make abortions rare.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.151
Rare. What do you mean?

08:46.443 --> 08:49.363
Well, by making birth control
freely accessible,

08:49.655 --> 08:52.157
thousands and thousands
of abortions aren't required.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.077
However, when a woman really
does find herself needing one,

08:55.369 --> 08:57.246
our clinics are vital
to their safety.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.830
It's hard to believe

08:59.122 --> 09:01.522
that there's still some people
out there that want to tell us

09:01.583 --> 09:03.669
- what we can and can't do with our body.
- Yeah.

09:03.961 --> 09:07.214
You know, I completely agree
with equal rights for women.

09:07.506 --> 09:08.757
And that's what
we're all about.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.569
- So, what's your name?
- Abby Brannam.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.345
Um, I am a junior
studying psychology.

09:13.637 --> 09:14.972
Nice to meet you.
I'm Jill.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.158
I work in community services
at Planned Parenthood.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.893
And we do need volunteers,
because many of our services

09:20.185 --> 09:22.604
are free or low-cost
for our clients.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.856
Okay. Sign me up.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.067
<i>I left campus that day as</i>

09:27.359 --> 09:29.778
<i>a proud champion
of women in crisis.</i>

09:30.070 --> 09:33.031
<i>So why didn't I call my mom
and tell her the good news?</i>

09:33.323 --> 09:34.923
Murderer!

09:34.992 --> 09:37.160
Murderer!

09:37.452 --> 09:39.413
<i>Because I didn't think
she'd understand</i>

09:39.705 --> 09:42.457
<i>how the work I'd be doing
wasn't going to</i>

09:42.749 --> 09:46.295
<i>increase the number of
abortions but decrease them.</i>

09:46.587 --> 09:48.797
<i>How's this for
a brilliant insight:</i>

09:49.089 --> 09:50.424
<i>never trust a decision</i>

09:50.716 --> 09:52.843
<i>you don't want
your mom to know about.</i>

09:57.222 --> 09:59.850
Hmm. Just keep staring at me.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.142
It's okay.

10:01.310 --> 10:02.728
You're just here
to check it out,

10:03.020 --> 10:05.188
and if you don't like it,
you don't have to stay.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.569
- Hi. Are you Abby?
- I am.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.621
- Hi. I'm Summer.
- Summer, nice to meet you.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.364
Nice to meet you, too.
Here, put this on

10:14.656 --> 10:16.009
so everyone knows
you're with the clinic.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.242
I'll hold this for you.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.372
So, really, is this normal?

10:22.664 --> 10:24.291
Just ignore them.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.294
When a client shows up, we head
for the car immediately,

10:27.586 --> 10:30.047
so there's someone waiting
when she opens her door.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.215
When she opens it,
start talking right away.

10:32.507 --> 10:33.634
- About what?
- Anything.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.469
The weather,
her car, her clothes.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.697
Anything to distract her from
the voices through the fence.

10:37.721 --> 10:38.961
They're gonna be harassing her.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.242
You need to make sure your
voice is the one she hears.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.535
I'll go with you
the first few times

10:42.559 --> 10:44.199
to make sure you get
the hang of it, okay?

10:44.227 --> 10:45.771
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.124
We've still got a few minutes
before our first arrival.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.358
Let's introduce you to Cheryl.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.653
The access code is 2-2-2-9.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.488
Uh, I'm awful
at remembering those.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.991
Oh, it's easy. It spells "baby."

10:58.283 --> 11:00.994
- Make sure to xerox the first two and file.
- Okay.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.621
Excuse me. Cheryl?
This is Abby.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.331
She's our newest
volunteer escort.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.623
Abby, this is Cheryl
D'Alessandro, clinic director.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.585
- Welcome. Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.671
- Let me take this for you.
- Thank you.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.923
Samantha? Here, come here.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.193
- Put that in a locker for me, if you would.
- Okay.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.236
Summer, why don't you keep
an eye on the parking lot.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.179
- Sure thing.
- Okay.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.764
Why do they all think

11:21.056 --> 11:23.350
that the women coming in
are having abortions?

11:23.642 --> 11:25.352
Uh, you do offer
other services, right?

11:25.644 --> 11:27.187
Not on Saturday.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.482
On Saturdays, we only do
abortions, and they know that.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.693
Especially
the Coalition for Life.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.704
They're like vultures.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.255
Their office is
right up the street,

11:36.279 --> 11:38.159
and their whole purpose
is to turn the community

11:38.198 --> 11:39.825
against us
and to try to shut us down.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.702
Here we go. First client.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.121
- Go ahead.
- Make sure to keep her moving.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.640
Hey, princess.

11:45.664 --> 11:46.944
Does Daddy know
that you're here?

11:46.998 --> 11:49.000
Yeah, yeah. Does he know
that you're killing

11:49.292 --> 11:50.794
his little grandbabies
right now?

11:51.086 --> 11:52.647
Oh, here they come.
Hi, Twinkies. How you doing?

11:52.671 --> 11:54.798
- Hey. Yeah, ignore me.
- Hi there.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.318
Starting to warm up, isn't it?
I love the color of your shirt.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.594
No matter what good things
you do in your life,

11:59.886 --> 12:01.680
you're still gonna be
a baby killer!

12:01.972 --> 12:03.682
All right. Look at me
and keep walking.

12:03.974 --> 12:06.852
And all this because you
couldn't keep your legs closed!

12:07.144 --> 12:08.144
Keep walking, basic!

12:08.395 --> 12:09.955
I'm talking to
the baby killer, not you!

12:10.021 --> 12:12.107
Abby, can you get
the door for her?

12:12.399 --> 12:13.692
Hey, you don't have to do this!

12:13.984 --> 12:15.736
Hey, get back here!
I'm talking to you!

12:16.027 --> 12:18.447
Okay, she's gonna take care
of you now, all right?

12:18.739 --> 12:19.865
- Thank you.
- Okay.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.617
I need you
to sign in here for me.

12:22.909 --> 12:23.994
Okay.

12:24.286 --> 12:27.038
The time now is 8:42.

12:31.877 --> 12:34.921
Okay. Your turn.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.257
Hi. I'm here from
the Coalition for Life.

12:37.549 --> 12:40.552
We know this is
a really hard day for you.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.637
We're here because
we care about you.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.223
Hi. Good morning.
How are you?

12:45.515 --> 12:46.675
- Good.
- Nice weather, right?

12:46.725 --> 12:48.477
- Yeah.
- Don't mind them.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.809
Your little baby
already has a beating heart,

12:51.021 --> 12:53.440
and she loves you
with all of it.

12:53.732 --> 12:57.611
What you're doing right now
doesn't seem like caring to me.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.573
I'm sorry. Come on.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.451
We'll just get you
inside, okay?

13:04.743 --> 13:07.120
Just walk through that door.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.872
They don't understand.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.284
Hey. My name's Marilisa.

13:11.541 --> 13:12.876
I'm with
the Coalition for Life,

13:13.168 --> 13:14.711
and we just wanted
to let you know

13:15.003 --> 13:17.714
that we have other options
for you if you're interested

13:18.006 --> 13:19.299
or if you want to talk.

13:19.591 --> 13:20.842
Damn it! They got one.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.014
I just wish they'd leave
these poor women alone.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.722
...feel safe and comfortable.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.694
- Elena, turn on the sprinklers.
- Come on.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.685
Renee, call the police
and report a disturbance.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.480
Okay. But the last time
we did that,

13:33.772 --> 13:35.772
the cops weren't super thrilled
when they showed up

13:35.816 --> 13:37.296
and nobody was doing
anything illegal.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.320
The number you're trying
to remember is 911.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.866
Okay. Yep. Yeah. Okay.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.290
Get the baby!

13:52.582 --> 13:54.417
<i>When my shift was over,</i>

13:54.709 --> 13:57.921
<i>I couldn't wait
to get out of there.</i>

13:58.213 --> 14:01.508
Hey. I don't think
I've seen you here before.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.385
No, it's my first day.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.345
Can you tell me
why you're volunteering?

14:08.056 --> 14:09.766
I don't know
if I'm coming back,

14:10.058 --> 14:11.351
so I'm just checking it out.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.020
Can I ask your name?

14:14.312 --> 14:15.605
Abby.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.440
- Abby.
- Mm-hmm.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.402
Abby, you do know that they
perform abortions here, right?

14:25.031 --> 14:28.243
You know, actually,
I've had an abortion myself.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.335
So I don't have any problem
with another woman

14:30.620 --> 14:31.620
making the same decision.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.224
I'm so sorry
you had to go through that.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.791
No, it's okay. Really.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.960
It was my decision.
No one forced me to do it.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.533
Well, if you ever want to talk
to anyone about anything...

14:39.796 --> 14:42.257
God, do you people ever stop?

14:42.549 --> 14:45.010
These women are hurting.
Why are you doing this to them?

14:45.302 --> 14:47.304
We're not here to hurt them
or condemn them.

14:47.596 --> 14:48.638
We're here to help them.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.265
By dressing up in costumes

14:50.557 --> 14:52.451
and showing them horrible
pictures to scare them?

14:52.475 --> 14:54.895
In what world would a woman
run to someone dressed like

14:55.186 --> 14:58.982
the Grim Reaper for help
with her crisis pregnancy?

14:59.274 --> 15:01.818
I am with the Coalition
for Life, and they're not.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.279
So we can ask them to stop,
and we do.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.823
But we can't force them
to do anything.

15:07.115 --> 15:11.036
So for what it's worth,
I think you're right, Abby.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.454
Doesn't help.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.372
Marilisa, leave her alone.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.416
Abby, get in your car.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.596
<i>Looking back, I'm surprised</i>

15:29.888 --> 15:32.724
<i>I admitted my having had
an abortion to Marilisa.</i>

15:33.016 --> 15:35.518
<i>I'd never told that to anyone.</i>

15:35.810 --> 15:39.105
<i>Meaning I probably ought to
take a moment to explain.</i>

15:41.942 --> 15:45.070
<i>In college, I'd gone from
small-town super achiever</i>

15:45.362 --> 15:47.822
<i>to party girl in no time.</i>

15:48.114 --> 15:51.701
<i>Literally, from the moment
my parents dropped me off.</i>

15:51.993 --> 15:54.162
<i>Mark lived in my building,</i>

15:54.454 --> 15:56.039
<i>and was ten years
older than me.</i>

15:56.331 --> 15:57.916
<i>We started dating...</i>

15:58.208 --> 16:00.335
<i>nothing serious,</i>

16:00.627 --> 16:04.339
<i>until the day I saw two lines
on my pregnancy test kit.</i>

16:10.220 --> 16:13.098
Hey. It's all right.
It's all right.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.642
We'll take you to a clinic
and take care of it.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.061
What do you mean?

16:18.353 --> 16:20.438
I know a place, in Houston.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.191
How do you know a place
in Houston?

16:27.028 --> 16:29.698
<i>Naturally,
Mark didn't have the $500</i>

16:29.990 --> 16:31.825
<i>it would take to "get it done."</i>

16:32.117 --> 16:33.243
<i>Neither did I.</i>

16:33.535 --> 16:35.996
<i>So I applied for
my very first credit card.</i>

16:36.287 --> 16:38.540
<i>I kept thinking,</i>

16:38.832 --> 16:41.710
<i>"I can't tell my parents
about this.</i>

16:42.002 --> 16:44.004
<i>"They can't know
I'm having sex.</i>

16:44.295 --> 16:46.965
<i>They can't know I'm pregnant."</i>

16:47.257 --> 16:49.634
<i>I remember there was
no one outside,</i>

16:49.926 --> 16:52.387
<i>but the waiting room
was packed.</i>

16:54.264 --> 16:56.558
<i>My next clear memory
was of finding myself</i>

16:56.850 --> 16:58.852
<i>lying on a table,
feet in stirrups,</i>

16:59.144 --> 17:01.813
<i>with a painful pressure
building in my abdomen.</i>

17:02.105 --> 17:03.898
<i>I could hear myself groaning,</i>

17:04.190 --> 17:05.775
<i>but it sounded distant.</i>

17:06.067 --> 17:08.486
You're fine, honey.
Just relax.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.116
<i>I remember waking up
slumped forward,</i>

17:13.407 --> 17:16.036
<i>sitting in
a hard plastic chair.</i>

17:16.327 --> 17:18.704
<i>My chair was one in a line</i>

17:18.997 --> 17:21.750
<i>filled by the girls who'd been
in the waiting room with me.</i>

17:22.041 --> 17:23.835
<i>Some were staring at the floor.</i>

17:24.127 --> 17:25.587
<i>Some were rocking
with their arms</i>

17:25.878 --> 17:27.630
<i>wrapped around their bellies.</i>

17:27.922 --> 17:30.258
<i>Some were softly crying.</i>

17:30.550 --> 17:32.677
<i>I was handed a few crackers.</i>

17:35.597 --> 17:38.224
<i>I slammed the experience
into a box, nailed it shut,</i>

17:38.516 --> 17:40.226
<i>stashed it in a dark corner
of my soul,</i>

17:40.518 --> 17:42.020
<i>and pretended
it never happened.</i>

17:44.230 --> 17:48.068
<i>But I wasn't finished
making bad decisions yet.</i>

17:48.359 --> 17:50.153
Abby, it's not too late
to stop this.

17:50.445 --> 17:52.363
I'll go grab the car,
you slip out that door,

17:52.655 --> 17:54.032
and we will drive away.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.117
I can't do that to my parents.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.411
Abby, your parents would be thrilled.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.054
Smile, Daddy.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.515
I'm trying.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.167
<i>To call our marriage a fiasco</i>

18:20.433 --> 18:22.435
<i>would be an insult
to fiascoes.</i>

18:22.727 --> 18:24.771
<i>The last straw was a year later
on Valentine's Day.</i>

18:25.063 --> 18:27.249
<i>Mark decided we'd celebrate</i>

18:27.273 --> 18:28.691
<i>by making sandwiches.</i>

18:28.983 --> 18:31.194
<i>But later that night,
after we'd gone to bed,</i>

18:31.486 --> 18:34.531
<i>he slipped out of the apartment
to be with another woman.</i>

18:34.823 --> 18:37.117
<i>I filed for divorce
the next day,</i>

18:37.408 --> 18:40.912
<i>anxious to be free of this man,
feeling like I already was,</i>

18:41.204 --> 18:43.289
<i>until a few weeks later...</i>

18:43.581 --> 18:44.833
Not again.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.127
<i>Panic and grief overwhelmed me.</i>

18:47.418 --> 18:50.672
<i>I didn't want to be connected
to this man in any way.</i>

18:50.964 --> 18:52.684
<i>And if I were to have his child,</i>

18:52.841 --> 18:56.094
<i>I'd be connected to him
for the rest of my life.</i>

18:56.386 --> 19:00.348
<i>So my next visit to the clinic
wasn't as a volunteer escort</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:02.892
<i>but as a client.</i>

19:03.184 --> 19:04.936
<i>I never saw
the ultrasound image.</i>

19:05.228 --> 19:08.857
<i>But the nurse practitioner told
me I was eight weeks along,</i>

19:09.149 --> 19:12.110
<i>which made me eligible for
a chemically induced abortion,</i>

19:12.402 --> 19:15.530
<i>better known as
the RU-486 abortion pill.</i>

19:15.822 --> 19:18.241
<i>The cutoff was nine weeks.</i>

19:18.533 --> 19:20.368
<i>It seemed more private,</i>

19:20.660 --> 19:24.330
<i>less invasive, more natural.</i>

19:24.622 --> 19:28.209
<i>So I handed over $400
and took the first pill.</i>

19:28.501 --> 19:30.461
Tomorrow, whenever you're ready,

19:30.753 --> 19:33.034
you're gonna take the four
pills in this little brown bag.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.507
That's misoprostol.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.559
It's gonna just gently
empty out your uterus.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.303
And there's gonna be
a little bleeding,

19:38.595 --> 19:40.388
but nothing more than
like a heavy period.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.960
And, uh, if there's
any cramping,

19:42.223 --> 19:43.391
you can take some ibuprofen.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.730
Okay, you're all set.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.611
Have a nice day.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.490
<i>The next day,
I did as I was told.</i>

19:59.782 --> 20:02.535
<i>I ate a light lunch and took
the pills inside my brown bag.</i>

20:05.705 --> 20:07.415
<i>I was told I would probably
start bleeding</i>

20:07.707 --> 20:09.083
<i>in about an hour.</i>

20:09.375 --> 20:12.086
<i>In the meantime, I made myself
comfortable in my bed.</i>

20:16.925 --> 20:18.343
<i>A little bit later...</i>

22:12.874 --> 22:15.335
<i>After 12 hours in agony,</i>

22:15.626 --> 22:17.962
<i>I fell asleep
on the bathroom floor.</i>

22:18.254 --> 22:22.592
<i>It occurred to me that this was
the way I was going to die.</i>

22:22.884 --> 22:24.802
<i>I wondered who would find me.</i>

22:26.971 --> 22:28.765
<i>I prayed it wouldn't be
my mother.</i>

22:30.850 --> 22:32.977
<i>It's not abnormal.</i>

22:33.269 --> 22:35.188
Not abnormal?

22:35.480 --> 22:37.732
The bleeding,
the clotting, the pain?

22:38.024 --> 22:39.150
That is normal?

22:39.442 --> 22:41.652
Use heating pads,
soak in a warm tub,

22:41.944 --> 22:43.237
take ibuprofen.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.282
How could you not have
told me about this?

22:46.574 --> 22:49.494
W-What happened to
gently emptying my uterus?

22:49.786 --> 22:51.871
That is what I was told
would happen.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.624
Look, I'm sorry,
but I have another patient.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.838
<i>Eight weeks passed.</i>

23:01.130 --> 23:03.633
<i>Eight weeks of blood clots.</i>

23:03.925 --> 23:07.011
<i>Eight weeks of excruciating cramps.</i>

23:07.303 --> 23:10.681
<i>And when it was finally over,
my anger had disappeared,</i>

23:10.973 --> 23:13.559
<i>only to be replaced
by self-loathing.</i>

23:13.851 --> 23:16.312
<i>Meaning I no longer blamed
Planned Parenthood</i>

23:16.604 --> 23:18.564
<i>for everything that happened.</i>

23:18.856 --> 23:21.150
<i>I blamed myself.</i>

23:22.860 --> 23:24.260
It doesn't look like
we're gonna get

23:24.445 --> 23:27.532
Dr. Plummer on Saturday,
but I can call Dr. Wagner.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.159
- Renee.
- That sounds good. Give him a call. - Cool.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.620
Abby. Hi.
We haven't seen you in a while.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.664
Um, yeah, I've been busy.

23:34.956 --> 23:37.125
Well, it's good
to have you back.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.918
By the way,
we have an opportunity

23:39.210 --> 23:40.545
I think you might be
perfect for.

23:40.837 --> 23:42.171
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.215
<i>Howdy.</i>

23:44.507 --> 23:46.968
- Are you familiar with Planned Parenthood?
- Not really.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.095
<i>So there I was,</i>

23:49.387 --> 23:51.147
<i>proudly waving
the Planned Parenthood banner.</i>

23:51.431 --> 23:53.057
<i>And six months later,</i>

23:53.349 --> 23:56.477
<i>after I graduated with
my degree in psychology,</i>

23:56.769 --> 23:59.272
<i>my cause became my career,</i>

23:59.564 --> 24:02.984
<i>despite the disapproval of
virtually everyone in my life.</i>

24:03.276 --> 24:05.653
The way I see it,
the real issue is viability.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.239
At that point, the fetus
could live outside the womb.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.291
But before that,
it's just undeveloped tissue

24:10.491 --> 24:12.201
that couldn't possibly
survive on its own.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.653
Abby, how can you say it's
okay to abort at eight weeks

24:14.745 --> 24:15.872
but not at 24?

24:16.164 --> 24:18.499
Viability keeps changing
as medical science improves.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.419
Are you saying that the measure
of what's moral or immoral

24:21.711 --> 24:23.111
changes as
medical science advances?

24:23.212 --> 24:25.173
What I'm saying is that
I'm not going to apologize

24:25.465 --> 24:28.176
for doing a job
that helps women in crisis.

24:28.468 --> 24:31.387
I love my job.
I am committed to doing it.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.639
It is who I am.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.809
It is part of
what makes me me.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.394
Take it or leave it.

24:38.686 --> 24:40.271
Fair warning, Doug.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.857
Dr. Dobson's book
<i>The Strong-Willed Child</i>

24:43.149 --> 24:45.860
was one of the first books
I ever bought.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.152
I still own it.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.643
All right,
who's up for dessert?

24:48.905 --> 24:50.656
Abby, sweetie,
why don't you help me?

24:52.867 --> 24:54.368
Thank you.

25:01.209 --> 25:03.252
You won't believe
what happened this week.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.254
A woman came in
with abdominal pain,

25:05.546 --> 25:06.631
and when we examined her,

25:06.923 --> 25:09.550
we discovered
it was uterine cancer.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.637
That's nice.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.056
You don't even care.

25:15.348 --> 25:16.548
More than you realize,
sweetie.

25:16.599 --> 25:18.639
Will you take these out
to the table for me, please?

25:25.066 --> 25:26.567
Okay.

25:26.859 --> 25:30.363
Right now, I need you to listen
to me and not say anything.

25:32.073 --> 25:34.909
I know you don't agree,
but to your dad and me,

25:35.201 --> 25:38.204
you were our baby
from the moment of conception.

25:38.496 --> 25:41.541
I know it's not how you feel,
but it's how we feel.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.586
You don't like
where she's working?

25:45.878 --> 25:49.131
I can't stand it.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.175
But you still
want to marry her?

25:51.467 --> 25:52.510
Oh, absolutely.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.472
Well, ain't love grand?

26:08.901 --> 26:11.612
You're not supposed
to look happier than I do.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.991
Why not?
You got it right this time.

26:15.283 --> 26:17.994
<i>So there I was,
making my vows again.</i>

26:18.286 --> 26:21.163
Who gives this woman today
to be married to this man?

26:21.455 --> 26:22.582
Her mother and I.

26:22.873 --> 26:24.834
<i>This time with a guy</i>

26:25.126 --> 26:27.086
<i>who actually loved me.</i>

26:31.799 --> 26:33.919
We do have other days
that you can volunteer

26:33.968 --> 26:35.248
or other shifts
if this isn't one

26:35.469 --> 26:36.669
that works out for you, but...

26:36.804 --> 26:38.556
Just one second. Hold on.

26:40.349 --> 26:41.726
Abby.

26:42.018 --> 26:45.104
Hi, Marilisa.
Any sign of the Grim Reaper?

26:45.396 --> 26:47.106
- No, thankfully.
- Mm.

26:47.398 --> 26:48.774
You look really nice today.

26:49.066 --> 26:50.192
Well, thank you.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.111
I am the new counselor.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.113
Well, I am sure
you are going to be

26:54.405 --> 26:55.885
the best counselor
they have ever had.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.742
Friend?

26:58.034 --> 26:59.952
- Fiancé.
- Oh.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.246
Yeah. She makes me come here.

27:02.538 --> 27:04.749
Liar. He was out here
praying most Saturdays.

27:05.041 --> 27:07.627
All he did was change it
to every Saturday.

27:07.918 --> 27:10.296
Well, congratulations, you two.

27:10.588 --> 27:11.839
I wish you every happiness.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.591
Thanks, Abby.

27:16.886 --> 27:18.054
<i>At this stage,</i>

27:18.346 --> 27:19.466
between six and eight weeks,

27:19.680 --> 27:21.280
it's just fetal matter,
a lump of tissue,

27:21.557 --> 27:24.226
not much more than a polyp
or a blood clot.

27:24.518 --> 27:27.355
- So it's not a baby yet?
- No, not at all.

27:27.647 --> 27:30.524
- And it can't feel any pain?
- None whatsoever.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.693
That's a concern
for a lot of women.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.071
And to be honest,
it was a concern for me, too.

27:35.363 --> 27:38.032
But the one thing
that all experts agree on

27:38.324 --> 27:41.077
is that, at this stage,
the fetus can't feel anything.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.707
- There's still a part of me that isn't sure.
- I know.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.042
Trust me.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.087
Nobody wants
to have an abortion.

27:51.379 --> 27:55.383
Not like they want a new car
or an ice-cream cone.

27:55.675 --> 27:59.053
But most of the women
who sit in that chair

27:59.345 --> 28:01.222
already know
that this is a pregnancy

28:01.514 --> 28:03.182
they aren't prepared
to deal with.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.559
It just takes a little time
to realize it.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.855
Assuming that you want
to go forward,

28:10.147 --> 28:12.307
the procedure we'll be
performing is called a vacuum...

28:12.566 --> 28:14.166
<i>About that time,
Doug and I decided</i>

28:14.402 --> 28:16.737
<i>that we wanted to make worship
a part of our lives.</i>

28:17.029 --> 28:19.532
<i>We found a church
that seemed to be a good fit.</i>

28:19.824 --> 28:22.952
<i>But most Sunday mornings, I
just felt left out in the cold.</i>

28:23.244 --> 28:25.496
"For You created
my innermost being.

28:25.788 --> 28:27.957
"You knit me together
in my mother's womb.

28:28.249 --> 28:29.959
"I praise You because
I am fearfully

28:30.251 --> 28:31.627
"and wonderfully made.

28:31.919 --> 28:35.506
All Your works are wonderful,
and I know them full well."

28:35.798 --> 28:38.592
What's awesome about
this passage is that we see

28:38.884 --> 28:41.178
that in-in the silence
of the womb,

28:41.470 --> 28:44.849
God is still forming
and fashioning people

28:45.141 --> 28:47.393
in His image
and in His likeness.

28:47.685 --> 28:49.854
- Yeah.
- I know exactly how you feel.

28:50.146 --> 28:51.439
I mean, I'm Catholic,

28:51.731 --> 28:53.691
and, on Sunday, I heard
a sermon about abortion.

28:53.983 --> 28:56.610
I don't care
what anyone says.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.612
I know that I'm doing
God's work here.

29:00.573 --> 29:01.949
Well, you guys will never guess

29:02.241 --> 29:03.868
who knocked on my door
last night.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.537
- Who?
- Shawn Carney.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.539
- Shut up.
- Wait, wait, wait.

29:08.831 --> 29:10.040
Sheriff Woody at the fence?

29:10.332 --> 29:11.351
- That Shawn Carney?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.085
- What did he want?
- Oh, it was so weird.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.880
I open the door,
and I recognize him.

29:16.172 --> 29:17.315
I'm like, "I know who you are."

29:17.339 --> 29:20.301
And he recognizes me, too,
and he gets all bashful.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.313
And he's like,
"Well, we're-we're just doing

29:22.386 --> 29:23.763
"this, uh, simple campaign.

29:24.054 --> 29:25.490
"We're trying to get people to pray

29:25.514 --> 29:27.767
for an end to abortion
for the next, like, 40 days."

29:28.058 --> 29:30.218
And I said, "40 days? Like
Noah and the flood 40 days?"

29:30.436 --> 29:32.104
- Stop!
- No! - I did.

29:32.396 --> 29:34.196
- I know. And he's like...
- You are horrible.

29:34.231 --> 29:35.524
Oh, you would've said the same.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.419
I... You would've said the same.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.111
- Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Yeah?

29:39.403 --> 29:40.683
How many doors
is he knocking on?

29:40.946 --> 29:43.949
Try and guess. You can't.
25,000.

29:44.241 --> 29:46.035
- Where?
- Yeah. Everywhere.

29:46.327 --> 29:47.745
Everywhere.

29:48.037 --> 29:50.015
- How is that even possible?
- What does that even mean?

29:50.039 --> 29:51.290
- You think he's lying?
- No.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.292
Kid like that
doesn't know how to lie.

29:53.584 --> 29:56.337
- That's true.
- - Pro-lifers are so serious.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.594
Mmm.

30:03.886 --> 30:05.655
Cheryl, those shoes

30:05.679 --> 30:07.056
- are amazing.
- I know. Thank you.

30:12.186 --> 30:14.146
- You really fit here.
- Thank you.

30:14.438 --> 30:15.648
Are you enjoying it?

30:15.940 --> 30:17.566
Yeah, absolutely.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.193
You know what,
I think it's time

30:19.485 --> 30:21.028
for you to take the next step.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.948
I'd like you to meet me in
the POC room in five minutes.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.991
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:29.537 --> 30:30.704
- Did you hear that?
- Mm-hmm.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.666
I really fit in here.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.752
Mm-hmm. Do you know
what POC stands for?

30:37.044 --> 30:38.921
Products of conception.

30:39.213 --> 30:41.131
Pieces of children.

30:41.423 --> 30:42.883
Hope you had a light breakfast.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.595
<i>In our facility,</i>

30:46.887 --> 30:49.515
<i>the POC room was
the Holy of Holies.</i>

30:49.807 --> 30:52.059
<i>Most of the staff
never set foot in there.</i>

30:52.351 --> 30:54.687
<i>After a surgical abortion,
each fetus</i>

30:54.979 --> 30:57.106
<i>had to be carefully reassembled
in a petri dish</i>

30:57.398 --> 30:59.318
<i>to make sure that none of
its parts were missing.</i>

30:59.608 --> 31:00.860
<i>Because if they were,</i>

31:01.151 --> 31:04.071
<i>it meant that they were
still inside the patient.</i>

31:04.363 --> 31:07.157
<i>By the end of the day,
there'd be 30 or 40 dishes,</i>

31:07.449 --> 31:10.744
<i>and the doctors would
have to sign off on each one.</i>

31:12.705 --> 31:14.206
I want you to see something.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.626
Go ahead.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.929
It's amazing.
You can see everything.

31:31.181 --> 31:33.181
Do you know what's happened
with every other person

31:33.434 --> 31:35.102
who's come in here
and seen one of these?

31:35.394 --> 31:36.979
The first thing they do?

31:37.271 --> 31:40.232
They cry.

31:40.524 --> 31:43.736
But not you.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.905
That's how I know
you're the one.

31:46.196 --> 31:49.450
Very soon,
I'll be called up to Houston,

31:49.742 --> 31:52.578
and someone will need
to replace me here.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.205
Personally,
I'd like it to be you.

31:56.874 --> 31:58.459
I'd be honored.

31:58.751 --> 32:00.794
Good.

32:07.217 --> 32:10.220
Babe, are you sure
you're not pregnant?

32:10.512 --> 32:12.806
No, I am not pregnant.

32:14.725 --> 32:16.060
Okay.

32:17.645 --> 32:20.022
What makes you think that?

32:20.314 --> 32:21.982
Nothing in particular.

32:24.151 --> 32:25.986
Doug, I counsel pregnant women
every day,

32:26.278 --> 32:28.614
so don't you think
that if I were to conceive,

32:28.906 --> 32:31.066
despite being on the pill,
that I would be aware of it?

32:32.242 --> 32:33.702
Yeah, you're right.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.746
Forget I said anything.

32:40.709 --> 32:43.879
- Do you have a test kit handy?
- Yeah.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.756
For who?

33:02.272 --> 33:05.192
You know, we could take care
of that for you if you'd like.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.325
What?!
Honey, that's wonderful!

33:13.617 --> 33:15.057
I-I didn't even know
you were trying!

33:16.161 --> 33:17.496
We weren't.

33:17.788 --> 33:21.333
Well, sometimes
the Lord just has a plan.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.711
- There's no chance...
- Don't worry, Mom.

33:24.003 --> 33:26.338
I never would have told you
if I wasn't sure.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.882
You're gonna be a grandpa.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.718
Ab?

33:31.010 --> 33:32.136
Hey, girl.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.138
Oh, we couldn't be
more proud of you.

33:34.430 --> 33:35.430
And you're committed

33:35.639 --> 33:37.558
to carrying this pregnancy
to term?

33:37.850 --> 33:39.018
I am.

33:39.309 --> 33:40.644
We are.

33:40.936 --> 33:45.482
We only have so much time,
so much energy.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.317
If you choose
to spend it elsewhere,

33:47.609 --> 33:49.778
there's less of you for here.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.031
I'm only telling you this
for your own good.

33:52.322 --> 33:54.575
I understand,
but once this baby's born,

33:54.867 --> 33:57.077
I promise,
I am back on the pill,

33:57.369 --> 33:58.889
and maybe this time
it will do its job.

34:00.497 --> 34:03.876
Look, I already warned Doug,
we are one and done.

34:04.168 --> 34:05.335
So, in the meantime,

34:05.627 --> 34:08.464
do you want to move me
to the lab or recovery?

34:08.755 --> 34:10.174
No.

34:10.466 --> 34:12.266
Don't you think
it'll make women uncomfortable

34:12.509 --> 34:14.219
- once I start to show?
- No.

34:14.511 --> 34:17.014
If anything, it will
encourage them to abort.

34:19.349 --> 34:21.310
One of these was just
administered in Exam Room 3.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.482
- Okay.
- And this is from Dr. Stevens in Room 1.

34:23.645 --> 34:24.645
1. Thank you.

34:24.855 --> 34:26.975
- Listen to what Abby says.
- Rob, Christina, hi.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.150
Abby, I am so glad you're here.

34:29.443 --> 34:31.362
I really appreciate you
helping us out with this.

34:31.445 --> 34:33.465
Oh, don't worry. We're gonna
take great care of her.

34:33.489 --> 34:35.364
Hey, it's okay to be
a little bit nervous,

34:35.657 --> 34:37.493
but there's absolutely nothing
to worry about.

34:37.784 --> 34:38.994
- Here's a packet.
- Thank you.

34:39.286 --> 34:41.080
Come on.
I'll get you checked in, okay?

34:42.873 --> 34:43.956
Go.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.127
<i>My parents are really</i>

34:47.418 --> 34:48.754
<i>pressuring me to do this.</i>

34:49.045 --> 34:50.755
But what if I'm still
making a mistake?

34:51.047 --> 34:53.382
You're not.

34:53.675 --> 34:56.594
Okay? High school is no time
to start raising a baby.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.597
Just relax.

34:58.889 --> 35:01.558
The doctor's gonna be in
in just a few minutes, okay?

35:01.850 --> 35:03.393
Can you stay in here with me?

35:03.685 --> 35:07.022
Sweetie, I would,
but I am just a counselor.

35:07.314 --> 35:09.817
They don't want me in here
during the procedure.

35:10.109 --> 35:12.109
The whole thing will take
just a couple of minutes,

35:12.236 --> 35:14.321
and I will check in on you
in the recovery room,

35:14.613 --> 35:17.866
and I promise you
that everything will be okay.

35:48.021 --> 35:49.857
Oh, my God.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.358
Elena!

35:51.650 --> 35:53.211
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, baby, you're fine.

35:53.235 --> 35:54.995
You're fine. We need
to get her back in, now.

35:55.028 --> 35:56.738
Get the chair!

35:57.030 --> 35:59.074
Okay, baby, we're gonna
get you to stand up.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.285
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
- Easy!

36:03.579 --> 36:04.830
It's gonna be okay.

36:05.122 --> 36:06.850
- What do I do?
- Get her on the table.

36:06.874 --> 36:08.000
Just... Oh, my gosh.

36:08.292 --> 36:09.793
- I got you. I got you.
- You got her?

36:10.085 --> 36:11.405
Oh, my God,
there's so much blood!

36:11.503 --> 36:12.647
Where are the pads?!
Where are the pads?!

36:12.671 --> 36:13.857
- Um, the bottom-bottom drawer!
- Where?

36:13.881 --> 36:14.941
Bottom drawer!
That's where they keep them!

36:14.965 --> 36:16.845
- So much blood.
- We need to stop the bleeding.

36:16.884 --> 36:17.884
It's gonna be okay.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.821
- Elena, get a doctor!
- Oh, my gosh! Okay! Okay!

36:19.845 --> 36:21.555
- Doctor!
- It's gonna be okay.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.432
- Doctor!
- Why is this happening?

36:23.724 --> 36:26.393
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.146
Damn it!
Get out of the way! Gauze!

36:29.438 --> 36:30.623
- I need more gauze, now!
- I don't know where it is.

36:30.647 --> 36:32.816
- Bring me the tray.
- Okay, okay, okay.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.444
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Start an I.V.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.487
I don't understand
what's happening.

36:37.779 --> 36:39.239
Here's the gauze.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.467
- Make it stop. Make it stop.
- She's so pale.

36:41.491 --> 36:42.635
Uterus is reading black,
completely black!

36:42.659 --> 36:43.803
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

36:43.827 --> 36:45.013
- What does that mean?
- It's full of blood!

36:45.037 --> 36:46.872
She's dying! Oh, my God!

36:47.164 --> 36:48.516
This isn't my job.
This isn't what I do.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.500
- Hello, hello.
- Okay, okay.

36:50.792 --> 36:51.919
Oh!

36:52.211 --> 36:54.211
Her pressure's
60 over 40, pulse is thready.

36:54.296 --> 36:55.536
She's gonna need a transfusion.

36:55.756 --> 36:57.883
All we have is plasma,
so start her on a drip.

36:58.175 --> 36:59.777
- Oh, God.
- Suction. What went wrong?

36:59.801 --> 37:01.529
- Why is this happening?
- Abby, calm down. Calm down.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.305
He's perforated the uterus,

37:03.597 --> 37:05.307
apparently without even
realizing it.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.076
It's a good thing
you found her when you did.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.161
Okay, I'm gonna
call an ambulance!

37:08.185 --> 37:09.895
No! No ambulance!
- - No!

37:10.187 --> 37:11.497
- Cheryl, explain it to her!
- No.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.523
We do not do that.
We never do that.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.335
Think about
all the protesters outside.

37:15.442 --> 37:16.735
You call an ambulance,

37:17.027 --> 37:18.747
and there's a picture of that
in the papers.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.531
911 calls are recorded.
They can be made public.

37:21.823 --> 37:24.223
And there's no way in hell I'm
going to allow that to happen.

37:24.493 --> 37:26.536
Yeah, but she could die,
and then if she does...

37:26.828 --> 37:28.497
She is not going to die,

37:28.789 --> 37:30.582
and she is not gonna
remember any of this.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.143
How do you know she's not
gonna remember anything?

37:32.167 --> 37:34.007
We use a very strong
combination of medication.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.463
Even when we wake her up,
she won't remember any of this.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.435
Push another round in her
of some fentanyl.

37:38.674 --> 37:40.526
- I'm not comfortable with that.
- Uh, you know what?!

37:40.550 --> 37:42.427
I don't care if you're
comfortable! Just do it!

37:42.719 --> 37:44.680
Injecting coagulant
directly into the cervix.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.731
See?
Everything's under control.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.001
- Her pressure's dropping.
- I'm not leaving.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.944
I'm not leaving
until she's okay.

38:06.159 --> 38:07.327
It's been two hours.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.389
- You said it was five minutes.
- Abby... you know Abby.

38:09.413 --> 38:11.613
Please tell me what... I-I need
to know what's going on.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.601
- Okay, I'm gonna go back and check.
- Please help me

38:13.625 --> 38:15.186
- find out what's happened to my daughter.
- I'm gonna

38:15.210 --> 38:17.188
go back and check. I'm sure
everything is okay, okay?

38:17.212 --> 38:18.815
- Will you, please?
- I-I'll be right back, okay?

38:18.839 --> 38:20.007
Thank you.

38:21.842 --> 38:23.218
I'm so sorry.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.024
Hey, we are really
backing up out there.

38:37.316 --> 38:40.402
And her father keeps asking
why it's taking so long.

38:40.694 --> 38:42.321
Thank you.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.577
Abby?

38:48.869 --> 38:50.787
If you're going to run
this clinic one day,

38:51.079 --> 38:52.789
I need to trust
that you're not gonna panic

38:53.081 --> 38:54.875
at the sight of a little blood.

38:55.167 --> 38:58.378
Now go out there and reassure
him that everything is fine.

39:15.645 --> 39:17.397
Just a little blood.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.332
Rob. Hey.

39:35.624 --> 39:36.917
Christina's fine.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.294
But we had another patient
who forgot to mention

39:39.586 --> 39:41.546
an allergy to a medication
that we use.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.638
So it's taking a little longer
than we'd like.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.258
- So she's okay?
- Oh, yes, she's...

39:45.550 --> 39:46.819
- Everything's all right?
- She's fine.

39:46.843 --> 39:48.595
Oh, thank God.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.472
So how much longer
is she gonna be?

39:50.764 --> 39:53.683
Well, the doctor
should be in any second.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.644
The procedure only takes
a few minutes,

39:55.936 --> 39:58.522
and recovery will be
just a little longer.

39:58.814 --> 40:00.232
Thank you, Abby.

40:00.524 --> 40:02.284
I'll let you know
as soon as she's out, okay?

40:02.567 --> 40:03.902
Thank you.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.660
<i>It took the doctor
almost another hour,</i>

42:07.150 --> 42:10.153
Surprise!

42:12.405 --> 42:13.907
- Yay!
- We're having a baby!

42:18.995 --> 42:20.539
<i>And later that afternoon,</i>

42:20.830 --> 42:22.070
<i>after terminating
38 pregnancies</i>

42:22.290 --> 42:23.375
<i>in the space of four hours,</i>

42:23.667 --> 42:26.461
<i>we spent two hours

42:26.753 --> 42:28.713
<i>with cake and flowers
and baby gifts.</i>

42:29.005 --> 42:31.550
- Aw.
- This is so soft, too. - Okay.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.805
Abby!

42:37.097 --> 42:38.640
You're expecting!

42:38.932 --> 42:41.685
What gave it away?

42:41.977 --> 42:43.895
When are you due?

42:44.187 --> 42:46.982
- Thanksgiving.
- Mine, too.

42:47.274 --> 42:48.775
Seriously?

42:49.067 --> 42:50.610
You're so tiny.

42:50.902 --> 42:52.862
Not for much longer.

42:53.154 --> 42:54.864
Think about how much fun
Christmas will be.

42:55.156 --> 42:58.243
Is there any greater blessing
than a new baby?

42:58.535 --> 43:00.787
It's okay.

43:01.079 --> 43:04.457
And I agree.
In the right circumstances.

43:09.671 --> 43:11.756
- Good to see you, Abby.
- You, too.

43:25.020 --> 43:26.771
<i>Around that time,</i>

43:27.063 --> 43:29.566
<i>Shawn Carney and his friends
started their first ever</i>

43:29.858 --> 43:31.943
<i>40 Days for Life prayer-a-thon.</i>

43:32.235 --> 43:34.863
<i>24 hours a day,
seven days a week,</i>

43:35.155 --> 43:37.490
<i>there were people praying
outside of our clinic.</i>

43:37.782 --> 43:39.159
These are extremist zealots

43:39.451 --> 43:40.660
that will stop at nothing

43:40.952 --> 43:42.662
to restrict
a woman's right to choose.

43:42.954 --> 43:45.354
So, are you concerned for your
safety and that of your staff?

43:45.457 --> 43:47.143
Yes, absolutely. Violence
is a real possibility...

43:47.167 --> 43:49.336
<i>Cheryl was beside herself,</i>

43:49.628 --> 43:51.338
<i>but I didn't
pay much attention.</i>

43:51.630 --> 43:53.798
<i>I was otherwise engaged.</i>

44:02.223 --> 44:04.267
Baby? Baby?

44:04.559 --> 44:06.478
I hate to tell you this,

44:06.770 --> 44:09.105
but he says you're only
two centimeters apart.

44:09.397 --> 44:11.983
What?!

44:13.860 --> 44:15.987
Maybe it was a bad time
to bring it up.

44:16.279 --> 44:17.280
Just shut up!

44:17.572 --> 44:19.282
Just don't-don't touch me.

44:19.574 --> 44:22.285
<i>And a mere 22 hours later...</i>

44:22.577 --> 44:25.372
Two centimeters!

44:25.664 --> 44:28.333
<i>...I gave birth
to a precious baby girl.</i>

44:28.625 --> 44:30.752
<i>- We named her Grace.</i>
- He's downstairs.

44:31.044 --> 44:33.004
He hasn't seen a poopy diaper
in a long time,

44:33.296 --> 44:35.590
and I think now's the
perfect time to show him one.

44:35.882 --> 44:38.259
Oh, he'll love that.

44:40.845 --> 44:43.056
Are you looking forward
to being home?

44:43.348 --> 44:45.725
Yeah, for the next
eight weeks, I am.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.186
Don't you think
that child needs you?

44:48.478 --> 44:51.147
And she'll have me.

44:51.439 --> 44:54.025
Cheryl's being promoted
and transferred to Houston.

44:54.317 --> 44:56.486
She wants me to be
the director of the clinic.

44:57.904 --> 44:59.144
I would be
the youngest director

44:59.322 --> 45:01.366
in Planned Parenthood history.

45:01.658 --> 45:03.743
It's not the kind of
opportunity you just pass up.

45:04.035 --> 45:07.414
Abby, I don't know
what you want me to say.

45:07.706 --> 45:11.042
I'm proud of
your accomplishments. I am.

45:11.334 --> 45:13.545
But I can't pretend to like
your choice of career.

45:13.837 --> 45:17.090
Have you thought about
the fact that, as the director,

45:17.382 --> 45:19.782
you'll actually be in charge of
the abortions at your clinic?

45:20.051 --> 45:21.344
Don't you see
that it's different

45:21.636 --> 45:23.197
from counseling women
about their choices?

45:23.221 --> 45:24.681
Sure, but now I can make ours

45:24.973 --> 45:27.434
the best clinic
in the entire affiliate.

45:27.726 --> 45:31.354
And decrease the number
of unwanted pregnancies.

45:31.646 --> 45:33.732
This is my chance
to make a real difference.

45:35.859 --> 45:37.736
Mom, what's wrong?

45:39.946 --> 45:41.364
I guess I hoped
that Grace's birth

45:41.656 --> 45:43.992
meant the end of all this.

45:44.284 --> 45:46.202
But, um, obviously it doesn't.

46:08.099 --> 46:10.560
She's not leaving.

46:10.852 --> 46:14.981
I have to believe
that she will, sooner or later.

46:15.273 --> 46:17.400
No.

46:17.692 --> 46:19.778
She won't.

46:20.069 --> 46:21.821
She's got aspirations.

46:35.919 --> 46:39.255
Babe, are we ever gonna
sleep again?

46:39.547 --> 46:41.049
No.

46:41.341 --> 46:43.760
But you're the one that gets
to get up tonight.

46:44.052 --> 46:45.929
I get up every night.

46:51.226 --> 46:55.396
I'm gonna pray that if I'm not
supposed to get the job,

46:55.688 --> 46:57.941
then I won't get the promotion.

46:58.233 --> 47:01.277
But you already applied
for the job, right?

47:01.569 --> 47:02.695
Yeah. So?

47:02.987 --> 47:04.697
So you're asking God
to show His will

47:04.989 --> 47:07.575
by stopping something that
you've already set in motion.

47:07.867 --> 47:11.120
Why not? He's God.
He can intervene.

47:11.412 --> 47:12.997
If I get the job,

47:13.289 --> 47:16.125
I'll know that it's His will
for me to run the clinic.

47:16.417 --> 47:18.753
Whatever you say, hon.

47:19.045 --> 47:20.046
Good night.

47:27.178 --> 47:30.181
<i>The next day,
I got the promotion.</i>

47:30.473 --> 47:32.233
From now on, no more
harassing the protesters

47:32.433 --> 47:33.601
or calling the police

47:33.893 --> 47:35.653
unless we've identified
someone as dangerous.

47:35.728 --> 47:37.998
Wait, so we're just gonna give
the anti-choicers a free pass?

47:38.022 --> 47:39.732
We're going to treat them
with respect

47:40.024 --> 47:41.502
and expect the same in return.

47:41.526 --> 47:42.837
And definitely no turning on
the sprinklers.

47:42.861 --> 47:44.320
Planned Parenthood.
This is Renee.

47:44.612 --> 47:46.090
No more letting them
get under our skin

47:46.114 --> 47:47.740
or losing our tempers.

47:48.032 --> 47:49.367
We're doing a good thing here,

47:49.659 --> 47:51.077
and the best way
to reinforce that

47:51.369 --> 47:52.954
isn't with words but actions.

47:53.246 --> 47:55.790
Okay. Okay, ma'am.
Of course.

47:56.082 --> 47:58.293
Abby, there's a woman
circling the block right now,

47:58.585 --> 48:01.254
and she can't come in because
somebody's filming outside.

48:01.546 --> 48:03.065
This is the third complaint
this morning.

48:03.089 --> 48:04.173
I'll take care of this.

48:04.465 --> 48:06.843
Okay. Ma'am, I am
so sorry about that.

48:07.135 --> 48:09.220
My boss is on it right now.

48:09.512 --> 48:11.222
Are you getting everything?

48:14.475 --> 48:15.768
Uh-oh.

48:17.729 --> 48:20.064
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi, Abby. I-I hear you've been promoted.

48:20.356 --> 48:21.649
Yeah.

48:21.941 --> 48:23.669
I'll understand if you're not
anxious to congratulate me.

48:23.693 --> 48:24.879
No, actually I was
thinking that

48:24.903 --> 48:26.505
the women coming in here
will finally have someone

48:26.529 --> 48:28.239
who cares about them
running things.

48:28.531 --> 48:29.908
Is this your camera?

48:30.199 --> 48:32.410
- Yes.
- I need it gone.

48:32.702 --> 48:33.942
I'm sorry,
but we can't do that.

48:34.037 --> 48:35.997
Sure, you can.
Just take it off the tripod,

48:36.289 --> 48:37.999
pack it up and take it back
to your office.

48:38.291 --> 48:40.376
Abby, we've been accused
of a lot of things,

48:40.668 --> 48:42.086
some of them criminal.

48:42.378 --> 48:44.148
This camera is our best
evidence that what we're doing

48:44.172 --> 48:45.882
is peaceful
and nonconfrontational.

48:46.174 --> 48:48.092
Shawn, this is not the way

48:48.384 --> 48:51.888
that you want to start out
our new relationship, okay?

48:52.180 --> 48:54.199
Just angle it away from the
fence; that's all I'm asking.

48:54.223 --> 48:56.309
Can't do it. We need to see
what's actually going on.

48:56.601 --> 48:59.354
If there's ever any question,
we need it to be clear.

48:59.646 --> 49:01.230
Mm-hmm.

49:01.522 --> 49:04.400
Sometimes I don't mind
you guys,

49:04.692 --> 49:07.278
but this morning,
you're really pissing me off.

49:12.241 --> 49:14.401
And for your information,
Shawn, there have always been

49:14.452 --> 49:16.172
people willing to defend
basic human rights.

49:16.454 --> 49:18.094
First there was
the fight against slavery.

49:18.247 --> 49:20.142
Then it was the people who
stood up against the Holocaust.

49:20.166 --> 49:22.168
Later it was a battle
for civil rights.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.629
And now it is
Planned Parenthood standing up

49:24.921 --> 49:26.361
for the reproductive rights
of women.

49:26.547 --> 49:27.983
Abby, you don't need
to justify your job...

49:28.007 --> 49:29.007
I'm not justifying
anything, okay?

49:29.008 --> 49:30.408
I'm just trying
to explain to you...

49:30.551 --> 49:31.737
And you don't need to explain
what you're doing either.

49:31.761 --> 49:33.346
The truth is
you've just cited

49:33.638 --> 49:35.056
three examples of injustice:

49:35.348 --> 49:38.017
slavery, segregation
and the Holocaust.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.894
That can only occur
when a whole segment

49:40.186 --> 49:42.021
of the population
is dehumanized.

49:42.313 --> 49:45.775
And that's exactly what Planned
Parenthood does to the unborn.

49:55.785 --> 49:57.745
Well, that went well.

49:58.037 --> 50:00.289
Yeah. She'll be fine.

50:11.759 --> 50:13.886
What are you smiling about?

50:14.178 --> 50:17.223
You got to give her this.
She got us to move the camera.

50:19.058 --> 50:20.578
<i>Part of my job
as clinic director</i>

50:20.768 --> 50:24.772
<i>was selling abortions,
and I was really good at it.</i>

50:25.064 --> 50:27.064
<i>You know those guys
who try to sell you time-shares</i>

50:27.233 --> 50:29.444
<i>in places
you never even heard of?</i>

50:29.736 --> 50:32.113
<i>They had nothing on me.</i>

50:32.405 --> 50:33.948
But, Jane,
you're eight weeks pregnant.

50:34.240 --> 50:37.076
You've already spent $150
on an ultrasound.

50:37.368 --> 50:39.328
If I book you today,
I'm authorized to credit that

50:39.579 --> 50:40.889
towards the cost
of your procedure.

50:40.913 --> 50:42.999
But if you walk
out of this office,

50:43.291 --> 50:45.352
then the soonest I can book you
again is two weeks from today.

50:45.376 --> 50:46.976
And at ten weeks,
the price goes up $100,

50:47.086 --> 50:49.130
plus you lose the discount.

50:49.422 --> 50:52.800
Choosing to wait's gonna
cost you an additional $250.

50:53.092 --> 50:55.052
So, is there any reason
that we shouldn't go ahead

50:55.094 --> 50:57.055
and schedule
your appointment today?

50:57.346 --> 50:58.806
You take credit cards, right?

50:59.098 --> 51:00.433
Absolutely.

51:00.725 --> 51:03.561
Okay, can I put you
on hold, please?

51:03.853 --> 51:05.980
Okay, thanks.

51:06.272 --> 51:08.608
I'm not doing this.
This is all you.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.280
Hi. This is Abby Johnson.
I'm the clinic director.

51:14.363 --> 51:15.883
Do you have a back parking lot?

51:16.115 --> 51:18.743
One where, like, I can't be
seen from the street?

51:19.035 --> 51:20.035
No, I'm sorry, we don't.

51:20.286 --> 51:21.537
All of our parking
is out front.

51:21.829 --> 51:23.081
Is there a problem?

51:23.372 --> 51:24.999
No. It's not
that big of a deal.

51:25.291 --> 51:27.960
It's just that my family's
outside the clinic praying.

51:28.252 --> 51:29.612
They know that
I'm coming in today,

51:29.837 --> 51:31.231
and they're trying
to talk me out of it.

51:31.255 --> 51:32.799
Okay. Um, how about this?

51:33.091 --> 51:35.093
Park as close as you can
to the door,

51:35.384 --> 51:37.136
and I will come out
and escort you in.

51:41.015 --> 51:45.269
Rhonda. Rhonda, baby,
please don't do this.

51:45.561 --> 51:47.480
Pl-Please.

51:47.772 --> 51:49.857
Please don't do this.

51:50.149 --> 51:52.401
W-Whatever you need,
you can come live with us.

51:52.693 --> 51:54.821
Hey, Lily. Hi.

51:55.113 --> 51:57.490
Hey, baby.

51:57.782 --> 52:00.993
Why are you crying, Grammy?

52:01.285 --> 52:03.913
Grammy's just
a little upset, okay?

52:04.205 --> 52:05.805
- Hey, baby, let's go inside.
- Love you.

52:05.998 --> 52:08.251
Let's go inside
with Mommy, okay?

52:08.543 --> 52:09.877
Mommy's coming, too.
Let's go.

52:10.169 --> 52:11.796
That baby you're carrying...

52:12.088 --> 52:15.258
it's gonna be
just as beautiful as Lily.

52:15.550 --> 52:19.679
Rhonda, think about the joy
that she's brought us!

52:19.971 --> 52:21.889
Now think about
a world without her!

52:22.181 --> 52:25.059
Rhonda, don't do this!

52:25.351 --> 52:26.435
- Rhonda!
- Are you okay?

52:26.727 --> 52:28.163
Because if you need
to talk about it,

52:28.187 --> 52:30.107
you know, it seems like
you have a lot of support

52:30.189 --> 52:32.150
from your family if you decided
to keep the baby.

52:32.441 --> 52:33.651
It's okay.
That's just my mom.

52:33.943 --> 52:34.943
It's how she is.

52:35.111 --> 52:36.821
Trust me, I'm fine.

52:37.113 --> 52:39.033
Please, I can't
go through this...!

52:40.992 --> 52:43.411
- Rhonda!
<i>- Fine?</i>

52:43.703 --> 52:45.830
<i>- How could she be fine?</i>
- God, help me.

52:46.122 --> 52:49.375
<i>I was deeply shaken
by what I'd just seen.</i>

52:49.667 --> 52:51.836
Help me. Help me, God.

52:52.128 --> 52:55.047

52:55.339 --> 52:57.633

55:38.419 --> 55:40.671
<i>a really big storm.</i>

55:42.757 --> 55:45.718
<i>Mention "Houston" and
"hurricane" in the same breath,</i>

55:46.010 --> 55:47.845
<i>and people immediately

55:48.137 --> 55:49.617
<i>Not many folks remember
Hurricane Ike,</i>

55:49.805 --> 55:52.600
<i>which is really weird
given that, when it landed,</i>

55:52.892 --> 55:54.369
<i>it was the third
most destructive hurricane</i>

55:54.393 --> 55:55.393
<i>in U.S. history.</i>

55:55.603 --> 55:57.605
<i>And what made Ike even scarier</i>

55:57.897 --> 56:00.107
<i>was that it was headed
straight for us.</i>

56:00.399 --> 56:02.799
...where it will make landfall,
but by Saturday, somewhere...

56:03.027 --> 56:04.695
Are you watching this?

56:04.987 --> 56:06.427
...dealing with
a Category 4 monster.

56:06.655 --> 56:08.699
You need to contact
all of your scheduled clients

56:08.991 --> 56:10.409
and tell them to stay home.

56:10.701 --> 56:13.245
But we have 40 women
depending on us.

56:13.537 --> 56:15.247
Some of them can't wait
another two weeks.

56:15.539 --> 56:16.999
It'll be past the cutoff.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.293
Can't we wait a little longer
before canceling?

56:19.585 --> 56:22.213
Mm, no. If anything were
to happen, we could be sued.

56:22.505 --> 56:23.756
We cannot afford the liability.

56:24.048 --> 56:25.383
I mean, at this point,

56:25.674 --> 56:27.474
half of Houston's already
packing up to leave.

56:27.593 --> 56:29.720
What if I bring in
everyone early,

56:30.012 --> 56:32.012
I rebook the doctor for Friday
instead of Saturday?

56:32.056 --> 56:34.266
I'll have everyone
in and out by 3:00 p.m.

56:34.558 --> 56:36.310
Mm, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

56:36.602 --> 56:38.312
We have to call
all the clients anyway.

56:38.604 --> 56:40.147
And we'll give them the choice:

56:40.439 --> 56:43.776
rebook two weeks from now
or come in tomorrow.

56:44.068 --> 56:45.903
Do it.

56:46.195 --> 56:48.948
Thank you.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.960
...motorists
stranded, major winds,

56:51.075 --> 56:54.662
and loss of power potentially
for several million customers.

56:54.954 --> 56:57.394
- We absolutely cannot be here on Saturday.
- Wait. Why?

56:57.456 --> 56:59.184
The building's solid,
and we have a backup generator.

56:59.208 --> 57:01.252
But traveling is
going to be impossible,

57:01.544 --> 57:02.938
with falling trees,
downed power lines,

57:02.962 --> 57:05.089
not to mention the flooding.

57:05.381 --> 57:06.381
Plus, it's probably gonna be

57:06.382 --> 57:07.442
illegal to drive
by tomorrow night.

57:07.466 --> 57:09.176
We need to call
every woman on this list.

57:09.468 --> 57:10.594
They can't come on Saturday.

57:10.886 --> 57:12.406
I'm hoping to rebook them
for tomorrow.

57:12.596 --> 57:14.515
Tomorrow?

57:14.807 --> 57:16.434
I'm bringing in two surgeons.

57:16.725 --> 57:18.845
We're running procedures
in both rooms simultaneously.

57:19.019 --> 57:20.729
Everything needs to run
like clockwork.

57:21.021 --> 57:23.190
We don't have time
to make mistakes.

57:23.482 --> 57:25.818
Once the last patient is
through recovery, we're gone.

57:26.110 --> 57:27.278
No paperwork, no cleanup.

57:27.570 --> 57:30.197
We bolt the door, race home,
and hunker down.

57:30.489 --> 57:32.689
But to make this work, we're
gonna need everyone's help.

57:32.950 --> 57:34.201
So are you guys in?

57:34.493 --> 57:36.096
- Yeah, I'm in. Whatever you need.
- Yeah.

57:36.120 --> 57:37.580
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.229
Second, I can finally confirm

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:10.149
the rumors that have been
swirling around.

01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:12.359
National has given
its approval.

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:14.403
Gulf Coast will soon be
breaking ground

01:00:14.695 --> 01:00:16.113
on this facility.

01:00:16.405 --> 01:00:18.532
Yeah.

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:21.535
- Wow.
- That's right.

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:23.537
78,000 square feet

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.998
of state-of-the-art
medical center,

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:29.376
making us the largest
ambulatory surgical facility

01:00:29.668 --> 01:00:31.712
in the Western Hemisphere,
allowing us to perform

01:00:32.004 --> 01:00:34.465
procedures all the way
to 24 weeks.

01:00:34.757 --> 01:00:37.384
But we're facing
some challenges as well.

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:40.116
Three hurricanes in four years
have emptied our cash reserves,

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:41.388
so take note.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.641
We are expanding
chemically induced abortions

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:45.267
to every day of the week.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:47.394
Now take a look
at the learning packets

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:48.872
in front of you, if you would.

01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:51.273
And there you will find
that each of your clinics

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:52.845
are being assigned
growth targets

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:56.737
to double last year's totals
on elective terminations.

01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:59.174
- Has she lost her mind?
- Because our margin is better

01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:00.842
on chemicals than surgicals,
with no doctors

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:04.495
cutting into our fees,
we are going to...

01:01:04.787 --> 01:01:06.038
Abby?

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:10.501
Well, it's just that

01:01:10.793 --> 01:01:13.837
abortion has never been
my main priority.

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.465
Just look at our mission
statement on page three.

01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:18.467
"To provide
a comprehensive range

01:01:18.759 --> 01:01:21.428
"of reproductive health care
and sexual health information

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.391
through patient services,
education and advocacy."

01:01:25.683 --> 01:01:27.434
That's what
I'm committed to doing.

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:29.436
So, if our stated goal is

01:01:29.728 --> 01:01:31.230
to decrease the number
of abortions

01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:34.066
by reducing the number
of unwanted pregnancies,

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:37.277
then why are we being asked
to double our abortion count?

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:44.076
Why don't we turn to page four.

01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:45.368
Thank you.

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:54.002
Abby.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.759
Frankly, I am shocked at the
way you sabotaged me in there.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:04.304
Is this how you thank me for
all that I have done for you?

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:05.824
- Cheryl, I wasn't trying...
- No, Abby,

01:02:05.848 --> 01:02:07.033
let me explain
something to you.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.308
Fast food outlets

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.978
look to break even
on the hamburgers they sell.

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:13.313
That's all they do
is break even.

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:15.691
Do you know
how they make their money?

01:02:15.983 --> 01:02:17.901
- No.
- On the French fries and the soda,

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:19.945
the low-cost high-margin items.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:21.957
Cheryl, I'm sorry,
but I don't understand...

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:26.535
Abortion is our fries and soda,
but somehow you've just decided

01:02:26.827 --> 01:02:28.370
that it's no longer
your priority.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:33.208
Abortion is
what pays your salary.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.544
It pays for
your matching 401(k),

01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:38.338
your four weeks' vacation,
your ample sick time.

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:42.301
Abortion... abortion is
what pays for all of it,

01:02:42.593 --> 01:02:45.179
for you and your family.

01:02:45.471 --> 01:02:49.516
Now, I didn't say anything when
you decided to get married,

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:53.562
and I said very little when
you chose to become a mother,

01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:55.494
although I knew
it would impact your work.

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:57.941
But as clinic director,
we are paying you

01:02:58.233 --> 01:03:00.944
to be a perfect instrument
of corporate policy.

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:03.739
And corporate policy is simple.

01:03:04.031 --> 01:03:07.367
We are an abortion provider.

01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:10.037
But we're
a nonprofit organization.

01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:13.707
Nonprofit is a tax status,
not a business model.

01:03:17.503 --> 01:03:19.379
<i>Can you believe that she</i>

01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:21.006
humiliated me like that?

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.884
I mean, I'm just
standing there with my award,

01:03:24.176 --> 01:03:25.469
looking like an idiot.

01:03:25.761 --> 01:03:29.556
And how am I supposed to double
the number of abortions?

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:31.826
Am I supposed to go driving
around the neighborhood,

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:33.170
telling everybody
to get pregnant?

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.729
I don't think that would work.

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:37.064
You're so funny.

01:03:37.356 --> 01:03:38.583
- Do you want a glass?
- Yes, please.

01:03:38.607 --> 01:03:39.607
You're gonna need one,

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:40.835
because you know
what really pisses me off?

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.569
What really pisses me off
is that they are

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:46.031
building the largest and most
advanced clinic in the country

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:49.159
so that we can perform
abortions up to 24 weeks.

01:03:49.451 --> 01:03:52.412
That is a line
I said I would never cross.

01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:57.000
Okay, pretend for a second
that you're someone like me

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:59.086
who believes
all abortions are bad.

01:03:59.378 --> 01:04:01.088
What's the difference?

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.132
Okay. First of all,

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:06.104
if we do them really late,
third trimester,

01:04:06.385 --> 01:04:07.585
it becomes a three-day ordeal.

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:09.245
It's no longer
a surgical procedure.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:10.514
It's labor and delivery.

01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:12.474
On the first day,
they introduce a demise.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.768
- Wait. A demise?
- Euthanize the fetus.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.187
They stop the heart
by injecting digoxin

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:19.679
through the uterine wall
directly into the baby's heart.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:21.209
Day two,
they induce contractions.

01:04:21.233 --> 01:04:23.068
Day three, it's the delivery,

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.680
an artificially induced
childbirth

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:26.488
of a terminated fetus.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.949
Abby...

01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:30.576
you're killing me.

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:33.161
Doug, you were the one
who asked the question.

01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:34.556
Yeah, I know, I know, but...

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.682
Well, who am I supposed
to talk to about this?

01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:36.706
I don't know.

01:04:36.874 --> 01:04:37.875
All right? I don't know.

01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:40.126
All I know is that here we are,
eight years later,

01:04:40.252 --> 01:04:42.421
and you're still thinking
that you can change them

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:45.215
when the only thing
that's changed is you, Abby.

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:46.547
Can you even hear yourself

01:04:46.592 --> 01:04:47.944
talk right now
about these procedures?

01:04:47.968 --> 01:04:50.596
These are little babies,
with a little brain

01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:53.074
- and little hearts, little fingers, little toes.
- Doug.

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:56.310
- Doug...
- I just love you so much,

01:04:56.602 --> 01:04:58.353
I can hardly bear to watch it.

01:05:19.041 --> 01:05:20.500
Hey, you.

01:05:20.792 --> 01:05:22.294
You need a break.

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:25.839
We... we need a break.

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:28.133
I would love to,
but I have a lot of work to do.

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:30.093
You only get
one day off a week,

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:32.025
and I'm not gonna
let you sit here slaving

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:34.014
for Planned Parenthood.

01:05:34.306 --> 01:05:35.641
So, grab your things.

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:37.535
We're heading for
the most thoroughly awesome

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:38.977
Mexican food on the planet.

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:40.729
And if you play
your cards right...

01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:43.398
I might get lucky?

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:46.026
Actually, I was thinking
I might throw in nachos,

01:05:46.318 --> 01:05:47.629
but, hey, I'm okay
with your suggestion.

01:05:47.653 --> 01:05:50.280
I bet you are. I'll be right back.

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:55.243
One pumpkin ale for you

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:57.055
- and a margarita for you.
- Thank you.

01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:59.539
Guys, I'll be back in a second
to take your order.

01:06:02.209 --> 01:06:03.961
Ah. Here's your menu.

01:06:04.252 --> 01:06:05.545
Pick you out something
real nice,

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:07.157
'cause I know
what I'm going with.

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:09.591
All right, so then
what are you having?

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:13.762
Only the biggest, wettest,
nastiest carnitas chimichanga

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:15.389
ever to come out
of that kitchen,

01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:17.849
if I have anything to say about it.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:20.018
So, how about you?

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.688
Mm, well, step aside, muchacho,

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:26.316
because I am having...
you ready for it?

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:31.071
The chocolate caramel
dulce de leche dessert nachos.

01:06:31.363 --> 01:06:33.573
What? Toast to that.

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.244
This is good.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:41.957
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:06:42.249 --> 01:06:44.376
Pace yourself, though.
We're just getting started.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:46.503
- Oh, is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:46.795 --> 01:06:49.256
Okay, so what is next?

01:06:49.548 --> 01:06:52.259
I'm thinking a film festival
at our place.

01:06:52.551 --> 01:06:54.471
Heads, you get <i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:55.678
Tails, I get <i>The Goonies.</i>

01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:57.407
No! I knew you were gonna say
<i>The Goonies.</i>

01:06:57.431 --> 01:06:58.551
I am not watching those kids

01:06:58.724 --> 01:07:00.076
- go through puberty again.
- It's a cult classic.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.351
No.

01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:03.283
- Give it a chance.
- No. Okay, all right.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.689
We will compromise
and watch <i>300.</i>

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.151
Is it any wonder why I love you?

01:07:09.443 --> 01:07:11.194
<i>300</i> it is.

01:07:12.821 --> 01:07:15.574
To us.

01:07:15.866 --> 01:07:18.452
Gracie at the parents',
a night alone.

01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:20.078
How good is this?

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.290
...Dr. George Tiller has died

01:07:22.581 --> 01:07:25.459
after being gunned down
inside his own church.

01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:28.170
One of the few such providers
in the country, Dr. Tiller was

01:07:28.462 --> 01:07:31.173
shot in the head this morning
during worship services.

01:07:31.465 --> 01:07:33.383
Police say they are
searching for a suspect

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:35.945
to offer protection to other
appropriate people - Let's go.

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:38.805
and facilities
around the nation.

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:40.657
- Now. Come on.
- The 67-year-old Tiller

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.684
had offered abortions
for more than three decades,

01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:46.813
performing by his own estimate
roughly 60,000 procedures.

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:48.857
Dr. Tiller was
the medical director

01:07:49.149 --> 01:07:50.734
of Women's Health Services...

01:07:55.989 --> 01:08:00.619
What kind of person would shoot
someone in the head in church?

01:08:02.454 --> 01:08:04.539
Doug, I knew him.
He had a family.

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:05.916
I know, Ab.

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:08.085
Right now, all I care about
is picking up Grace

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:09.896
and getting the two of you
home safely.

01:08:10.045 --> 01:08:11.838
You think I'm in danger?

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:15.300
I don't know, but I'm not
taking any chances.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.684
Are you okay, sweetheart?

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.144
I'm fine, Mom.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.649
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:08:30.941 --> 01:08:32.460
Wait, don't you think
it makes more sense

01:08:32.484 --> 01:08:34.986
- for you to spend the night here?
- Come on.

01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:46.997
It's false sympathy.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.416
That's what it is.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:50.794
All these pro-lifers

01:08:51.086 --> 01:08:52.845
condemning a killer's actions
like they care?

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.524
I think they're just trying
to avoid the blame.

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:55.608
It doesn't matter, okay?

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.218
What matters is that
we keep everyone here...

01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:03.348
that means you, me, all of us
and our clients... safe.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.892
We need to pay
special attention to anything

01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:07.904
that seems out of place.

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:13.233
Planned Parenthood.
This is Renee.

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:15.234
It's Houston, for you.

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:20.657
- This is Abby.
- This is Susan from HR.

01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:22.617
I need you to come to Houston.

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:24.786
Can you drive down
this afternoon?

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.247
Um, it's kind of short notice.
Is this about Tiller?

01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:31.835
No, Abby, it's about you.

01:09:32.127 --> 01:09:34.129
Cheryl and I would like
to meet with you.

01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:36.798
Okay. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:40.676
Corporate wants
to meet with me.

01:09:49.895 --> 01:09:52.104
<i>Abby, we've called you here
to let you know</i>

01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:53.716
you're being
formally reprimanded.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:55.942
What am I being
reprimanded for?

01:09:56.234 --> 01:09:58.945
You've been challenging me
and my authority.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:00.697
You've become combative,

01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:03.700
disputing my directives,
arguing and pushing back.

01:10:03.992 --> 01:10:04.992
I'm your supervisor.

01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:07.871
Therefore, it's your job
to follow my instructions.

01:10:08.163 --> 01:10:11.499
In my eight years
at Planned Parenthood,

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:16.338
I have never received
anything less than praise.

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:19.216
I've not had
a single black mark,

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:22.510
not a warning,
much less a reprimand.

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:25.764
You just honored me
as Employee of the Year.

01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:29.434
No one has been
more committed than I have.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:32.812
Nonetheless,
the reprimand stands.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:34.540
I'll need you to sign
this acknowledgment

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:38.693
that we had this talk
and you are aware of it.

01:10:38.985 --> 01:10:41.696
<i>I know this might be
hard to believe,</i>

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:44.699
<i>but I went back to the clinic
the next morning,</i>

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:46.701
<i>more determined than ever
to do my job</i>

01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:48.620
<i>to the best of my ability.</i>

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.716
Is that what I think it is?

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:03.969
Afraid so.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.389
Do you mind if we pray over it?

01:11:09.057 --> 01:11:11.309
- I don't know about that, man.
- Please?

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.436
Look, I'm not
some kind of monster.

01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:15.605
I-I'm just a guy who drives
a truck. I don't...

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:18.608
We'll be quick. We'll stay
on this side of the fence.

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:21.903
Okay.

01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:36.001
You might want to wait.
I got another one coming out.

01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:45.010
Hey, Abby.
Sorry to bother you,

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:47.142
but they need an extra person
in the back room.

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:48.805
- Are you free?
- Sure.

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.568
Hi. Megan said you needed
some assistance?

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:20.962
Lord, we commend the souls

01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:24.215
of these hundreds of children,
whose true names

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:27.802
<i>are known only to You,
to Your keeping.</i>

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:31.014
<i>For we know they are with You
now and forever.</i>

01:12:33.892 --> 01:12:37.270
We pray for healing for the
wounded mothers and fathers.

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:40.023
And, Lord, we pray
to end the sin

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:41.816
<i>of abortion.</i>

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.944
<i>For in Your word, you have
promised, "If My people</i>

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:47.396
<i>"who are called by My name</i>

01:12:47.614 --> 01:12:50.075
<i>"will humble themselves
and pray and seek My face</i>

01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:53.078
<i>"and turn from
their wicked ways,</i>

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:54.913
"then I will hear from Heaven,

01:12:55.205 --> 01:12:58.917
and I will forgive their sin,
and I will heal their land."

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:45.588
Abby Johnson
is in the other room.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.134
Here?

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:51.553
She wants out.

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:08.570
Rough day at the office?

01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:10.321
Yeah.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:14.242
Yeah, uh...
you could say that.

01:14:14.534 --> 01:14:16.453
Want to talk about it?

01:14:18.746 --> 01:14:20.290
Thanks.

01:14:24.169 --> 01:14:27.088
I saw it.

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:31.134
And it moved.

01:14:33.178 --> 01:14:37.182
And it was like it was twisting
and fighting for its life.

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:42.020
This tiny...

01:14:42.312 --> 01:14:44.355
tiny, perfect little baby.

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:48.276
And then it was just gone.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.247
I'm gonna go in on Monday,

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.833
and I'm gonna
put in my resignation,

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:05.710
and that's it.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:10.924
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:16.054
I...

01:15:16.346 --> 01:15:19.933
I never want to be
a part of an abortion again.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:35.240
Everybody's looking for me
and asking if I'm okay.

01:15:35.532 --> 01:15:38.159
How long have you been gone?

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:39.744
Almost an hour.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:41.621
On a Saturday?

01:15:41.913 --> 01:15:44.123
Won't that
make them suspicious?

01:15:46.251 --> 01:15:47.669
They would never guess
I was here.

01:15:47.961 --> 01:15:50.380
They-they wouldn't understand.

01:15:50.672 --> 01:15:53.550
Abby, we can help you
find another job.

01:15:53.841 --> 01:15:56.427
We've always told you
we're here to help.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:16:00.431
We can help you or anyone at
the clinic who wants to leave.

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:03.017
Are you serious?

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:04.978
You would really help me?

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:07.105
Yes, of course.

01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:09.107
In the meantime,
don't tell anyone

01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:11.359
that you're done with
Planned Parenthood.

01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:14.362
Don't underestimate
the repercussions of this.

01:16:14.654 --> 01:16:17.574
You got to be careful, got it?

01:16:19.534 --> 01:16:20.910
I'll walk you out the back.

01:16:21.202 --> 01:16:24.539
Less chance of anyone seeing you.

- You should... Here you go.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:55.570
I know, but, look,
here's two more edges.

01:16:55.862 --> 01:16:57.697
That may be all we need.

01:16:57.989 --> 01:16:59.991
- We're close now.
- Oh, here's one.

01:17:00.283 --> 01:17:01.826
Hi, baby.

01:17:04.037 --> 01:17:06.956
Is that it right there?

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:10.460
You will never guess
where I was today.

01:17:10.752 --> 01:17:13.171
Um, Shawn's office?

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:17.383
How could you
possibly know that?

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:18.801
I don't know.

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:20.973
It's just that, with
the conversations we've had

01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:23.212
and all that's been going on
lately, I figured you might

01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:26.309
reach out to him at some point.

01:17:26.601 --> 01:17:29.062
That...

01:17:29.354 --> 01:17:31.189
plus the look on your face.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.154
I'm gonna do it, Doug.
I'm gonna leave.

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:39.947
Have you told your mom yet?

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:42.784
Not yet.

01:17:43.076 --> 01:17:45.578
I want to be out the door.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:48.539
I want it to be over
before I do.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:58.341
Here you go.

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.676
Abby, what's wrong?

01:18:44.429 --> 01:18:47.473
Megan, I need
to tell you something.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.852
You have to promise
not to tell anyone.

01:18:51.144 --> 01:18:52.353
Yeah, no, I-I won't.

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:54.063
I'm leaving
Planned Parenthood.

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:57.859
I have to get out.

01:18:58.151 --> 01:19:00.027
I can't be
a part of this anymore.

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:01.904
You're leaving?

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:04.282
I went over to
40 Days for Life that day.

01:19:04.574 --> 01:19:06.242
They were so amazing.

01:19:06.534 --> 01:19:09.912
They just sat and listened
while I cried.

01:19:10.204 --> 01:19:11.581
And they're really
gonna help you?

01:19:11.873 --> 01:19:14.000
Yeah, they are.

01:19:14.292 --> 01:19:16.753
I mean, no judgment,
no condemnation.

01:19:17.044 --> 01:19:19.255
They're even gonna help me
find another job.

01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:23.217
So, when do you leave?

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:25.428
Today.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.889
I know
Cheryl is going to lose it

01:19:28.181 --> 01:19:30.057
- when she finds out.
- Yeah.

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:33.227
But... I'm gonna type up
my resignation,

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:36.898
and at 5:01, I am sending it
to HR in Houston,

01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:39.859
and I am gonna walk out that
front door like any other day.

01:19:40.151 --> 01:19:42.028
Geez.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.489
Are you gonna tell Taylor, too?

01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:47.617
Of course.
You guys are my best friends.

01:19:47.909 --> 01:19:51.245
But you're the only ones
who can know, no one else.

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:53.080
Of course.

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:37.250
So this is it.

01:20:37.542 --> 01:20:38.876
How's it feel?

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:40.920
Like I just got out of prison.

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:44.841
- Bye.
- See ya.

01:20:55.101 --> 01:20:56.769
Hey, Mom.

01:20:57.061 --> 01:20:58.563
I just wanted
to tell you something

01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:00.375
before you heard it
from somebody else.

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:01.983
Are you pregnant?

01:21:02.275 --> 01:21:04.569
No.

01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:06.946
No. Um...

01:21:07.238 --> 01:21:08.990
I resigned from
Planned Parenthood today.

01:21:11.576 --> 01:21:13.578
She quit.

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:15.746
Done the right thing, Abby.

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:18.624
I've been praying for years
that you'd leave there.

01:21:18.916 --> 01:21:22.169
I have so much to tell you.

01:21:41.022 --> 01:21:43.774
Abby?

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:45.735
Abby, it's the middle
of the night.

01:21:46.027 --> 01:21:47.778
What are you doing up?

01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:58.164
Hey.

01:21:58.456 --> 01:22:00.207
Baby, what's the matter?

01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:10.801
I have been complicit...

01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:16.599
...in over 22,000 abortions.

01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:22.438
That... that is
the weight of my guilt.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:28.653
How do I even begin
to comprehend that?

01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:30.488
You can't, baby.

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:32.865
Nobody can, okay?

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:35.409
All you can do is

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:39.497
say you're sorry
and beg forgiveness.

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:41.874
I am sorry.

01:22:44.085 --> 01:22:45.878
I am so sorry.

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:51.842
Those women...

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:55.721
they came to me
looking for help...

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:58.599
and I lied to them.

01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:00.851
I lied to them.

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:06.524
I betrayed them.

01:23:06.816 --> 01:23:10.027
I told them that the best thing
for them to do

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:12.571
was to kill their babies.

01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:20.287
What have I done?

01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:24.166
You did what you thought
was right, baby.

01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:28.129
Then why do I feel so ashamed?

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:32.717
Abby, look at me.

01:23:37.972 --> 01:23:39.682
I love you.

01:23:39.974 --> 01:23:42.893
And so does God.

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:45.438
He'll forgive you if you ask.

01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:48.691
I-I can't even believe that.

01:23:48.983 --> 01:23:50.735
How? How could He?

01:23:53.904 --> 01:23:56.574
Because He's God.

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:10.546
<i>I spent the next two days
ugly crying.</i>

01:24:10.838 --> 01:24:12.339
<i>Day three, I woke up</i>

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:14.671
<i>and headed straight for
Shawn and Marilisa's office.</i>

01:24:14.759 --> 01:24:16.427
<i>Blame it on my Texas roots,</i>

01:24:16.719 --> 01:24:18.119
<i>but I couldn't show up
empty-handed.</i>

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:20.157
Abby.
What are you doing here?

01:24:20.181 --> 01:24:23.225
I'm here to help, any way
I can, and I brought donuts.

01:24:26.145 --> 01:24:27.521
<i>Here we are, drinking coffee</i>

01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:30.232
<i>with Abby Johnson.</i>

01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:32.735
Okay, well, if you guys think
it is weird for you,

01:24:33.027 --> 01:24:36.155
just imagine how I feel.

01:24:36.447 --> 01:24:37.865
Abby, I am so glad you're here.

01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:39.784
It should have been this way
all along.

01:24:40.076 --> 01:24:41.494
You know, I got to admit,

01:24:41.786 --> 01:24:43.722
sometimes, in the midst of
all the hours on the fence,

01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:45.724
I was beginning to wonder
if we were doing any good.

01:24:45.748 --> 01:24:47.468
Most of the time,
we just prayed and prayed,

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.001
and it didn't seem to matter.

01:24:49.293 --> 01:24:52.171
- Trust me, it mattered.
- Why do you say that?

01:24:52.463 --> 01:24:53.964
Shawn, I was
the clinic director,

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:57.885
and any time that you were out
there, my no-show rate climbed,

01:24:58.177 --> 01:24:59.970
which is why I was
so annoyed with you.

01:25:01.639 --> 01:25:04.058
Seriously, it wasn't
just us, though.

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:06.560
Planned Parenthood's
own statistics show that,

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:08.562
if someone's praying
outside the clinic,

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:11.190
it can go as high as 75%.

01:25:11.482 --> 01:25:13.818
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:15.528
It's like this
dirty little secret

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.238
they don't want anyone to know.

01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:18.781
When women see you praying,

01:25:19.073 --> 01:25:22.827
they just suddenly decide
not to show up.

01:25:23.119 --> 01:25:25.830
They circle the parking lot
and never come in.

01:25:26.122 --> 01:25:27.706
Meaning most of the lives
that you save,

01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:30.334
you never even know about.

01:25:32.586 --> 01:25:35.714
Which is why I need
to go to the fence.

01:25:36.006 --> 01:25:37.133
Abby, I really don't think

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:39.064
this is something
you should be doing yet.

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:41.637
But it's something
I need to do.

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:47.351
Hi. My name is Abby Johnson.

01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:49.353
I used to be the director
of this clinic.

01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:52.773
I quit because my conscience
wouldn't let me stay.

01:25:55.025 --> 01:25:58.696
I just want to talk to you for
a minute, please just a minute.

01:25:58.988 --> 01:26:00.865
Please?

01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:02.908
I guess.

01:26:05.202 --> 01:26:08.622
It's always possible you're
just here for a pregnancy test,

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:11.195
but I'm guessing you've already
seen the results of yours.

01:26:12.877 --> 01:26:14.086
Two of them.

01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:18.174
And you feel like your whole
world is caving in around you,

01:26:18.465 --> 01:26:20.843
and you've never been
so scared and alone.

01:26:21.135 --> 01:26:22.761
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:26.432
Let me tell you
what's gonna happen

01:26:26.724 --> 01:26:28.434
if you go in that door.

01:26:28.726 --> 01:26:30.787
The first thing they're gonna
do is give you an ultrasound,

01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:32.251
but they're not gonna
let you see it.

01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:33.689
Why not?

01:26:33.981 --> 01:26:36.817
Because they don't want you
to see your baby.

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:39.278
Then why do they do
the ultrasound?

01:26:39.570 --> 01:26:41.280
Because the ultrasound
determines

01:26:41.572 --> 01:26:42.907
the size of the fetus.

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:45.242
And the size of the fetus,
the skull in particular,

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:48.746
is what determines the price
they're going to charge you.

01:26:52.291 --> 01:26:55.085
Why are you telling me this?

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.339
Because I understand
better than anyone

01:26:58.631 --> 01:27:00.966
that, inside that building,
they don't offer solutions.

01:27:01.258 --> 01:27:02.298
They only offer abortions.

01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:03.761
And if you go
through that door,

01:27:04.053 --> 01:27:07.473
you will not come out the
same person, because you can't.

01:27:07.765 --> 01:27:10.476
And everybody wants to pretend
like you can, but you can't.

01:27:10.768 --> 01:27:13.771
Because the truth is you can
let them get rid of your baby,

01:27:14.063 --> 01:27:16.774
but they can't get rid of
the memory of your baby.

01:27:17.066 --> 01:27:21.695
And neither can you,
no matter how hard you try.

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:25.407
I don't know what to do.

01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:29.536
What's your name?

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:31.705
Hannah.

01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:33.917
Hannah, it's gonna be okay,
I promise, I promise.

01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:35.584
And I'll be there
every step of the way.

01:27:35.876 --> 01:27:37.253
I'll do anything I can
to help you.

01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:41.966
If you get in that car...

01:27:56.605 --> 01:27:57.982
Okay.

01:28:14.832 --> 01:28:17.042
Bravo. Let me guess.

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:18.794
Former clinic director

01:28:19.086 --> 01:28:20.897
describes the mechanics
of fetal dismemberment...

01:28:20.921 --> 01:28:22.121
You know what, Cheryl, that...

01:28:22.339 --> 01:28:23.817
...complete with
all the tools involved.

01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:25.050
That's not what it was like.

01:28:25.342 --> 01:28:26.902
You know what?
It doesn't really matter.

01:28:27.136 --> 01:28:29.305
You've become a traitor, Abby.

01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:31.557
Some of us are
still loyal to the cause.

01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:33.329
Some of us still believe
in protecting

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.768
a woman's right to choose.

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.353
And those of us who do,

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:39.565
we are a part of
a billion-dollar corporation

01:28:39.857 --> 01:28:42.943
with lawyers and lobbyists
and media experts on staff.

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:46.322
Have you ever seen
the names of our donors?

01:28:46.613 --> 01:28:48.741
Soros, Gates, Buffett.

01:28:49.033 --> 01:28:51.410
That's who we have.
Who have you got, Abby?

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:57.416
Cheryl, what you are doing
is wrong.

01:28:57.708 --> 01:28:59.752
Is it?

01:29:00.044 --> 01:29:01.879
America wants abortion,

01:29:02.171 --> 01:29:05.090
which is why we exist and why
we will continue to exist

01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:07.634
long after you and
your newfound friends are gone.

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:09.636
Oh, yes, I know all about them.

01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:13.474
Did you honestly think
that we wouldn't find out?

01:29:13.766 --> 01:29:16.894
No one has ever turned on us
like this before, Abby.

01:29:17.186 --> 01:29:19.426
Which is why national is going
to make an example of you.

01:29:20.481 --> 01:29:22.066
So, congratulations.

01:29:22.358 --> 01:29:23.817
You've managed to make an enemy

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:27.446
of one of the most powerful
organizations on the planet.

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.706
I love this patch.

01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:39.416
Mm.

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:41.627
Turn this way, baby.

01:29:41.919 --> 01:29:43.837
Do you remember
what I was telling you earlier

01:29:44.129 --> 01:29:45.381
about what Cheryl said?

01:29:45.672 --> 01:29:47.383
It'd be kind of hard to forget.

01:29:47.674 --> 01:29:50.427
Yeah, well, now Megan isn't
returning my phone calls,

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:52.429
and her phone number
has been disconnected.

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:54.264
Uh-oh.

01:29:54.556 --> 01:29:56.517
Can we go now, please?

01:29:56.809 --> 01:29:58.435
Does Mommy look like
she's ready?

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:00.270
- No.
- No.

01:30:00.562 --> 01:30:03.315
And you need to go get
your ladybug wand upstairs.

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:11.865
- You still up for this?
- Absolutely.

01:30:12.157 --> 01:30:14.535
I am not letting Cheryl
or Planned Parenthood

01:30:14.827 --> 01:30:16.787
ruin Halloween for our kid.

01:30:17.079 --> 01:30:19.581
Or you.

01:30:19.873 --> 01:30:21.476
I'm serious, babe.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.186
Whoever created this holiday
deserves a medal.

01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:25.504
We get to dress up, act stupid,
and people give us candy.

01:30:25.796 --> 01:30:26.796
How cool is that?

01:30:27.047 --> 01:30:28.327
You do realize

01:30:28.382 --> 01:30:29.800
they give Grace
the candy, though?

01:30:30.092 --> 01:30:31.292
Yes, but she knows

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:32.750
Daddy's involvement is crucial.

01:30:32.886 --> 01:30:33.887
She's still new to this,

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:36.598
whereas I bring decades
of experience.

01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:38.076
Arr, milady.

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.100
Okay.

01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:40.453
- All right.
- Daddy, let's go!

01:30:40.477 --> 01:30:42.117
Can you take this one
so I can call Shawn?

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:43.187
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:30:43.313 --> 01:30:44.481
Hold up, hold up!

01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:51.801
- Abby?
- Did you get my messages about Cheryl's threat?

01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:54.150
Yeah. We're being sued.
We're both gonna need lawyers.

01:30:54.408 --> 01:30:57.786
Sued? Do you realize
how serious this is?

01:30:58.078 --> 01:31:00.539
Yeah. And I just realized
you're 100 feet away from me.

01:31:00.831 --> 01:31:01.831
Abby!

01:31:04.001 --> 01:31:06.628
- Hon, why don't you go ahead while I talk to Abby.
- Okay.

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:07.920
Bye, pumpkin.

01:31:07.921 --> 01:31:09.214
Are you sure about this?

01:31:09.506 --> 01:31:12.676
Yes. We got served
right before I left work.

01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:14.608
There's a lawsuit from
Planned Parenthood,

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:15.720
plus a restraining order

01:31:15.721 --> 01:31:17.241
to keep us from saying
anything public.

01:31:17.347 --> 01:31:18.787
Yours will probably arrive
on Monday.

01:31:19.016 --> 01:31:20.577
When were you planning on
telling me about this?

01:31:20.601 --> 01:31:22.311
Figured I'd let you enjoy
trick-or-treating

01:31:22.603 --> 01:31:24.021
and then give you a call.

01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:27.149
What are we gonna do?

01:31:27.441 --> 01:31:29.151
I've already talked with
Jeff Paradowski.

01:31:29.443 --> 01:31:31.278
I believe his response was,
"I'm in, baby!"

01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:32.570
Wait, wait, wait.

01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:33.851
The one that's
on the billboards,

01:31:33.947 --> 01:31:35.133
pointing his finger, saying...

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:36.283
"Get what you deserve!"

01:31:36.575 --> 01:31:39.453
Yeah. He's an old friend.

01:31:39.745 --> 01:31:42.789
Okay, um, you realize
that attorneys cost money

01:31:43.081 --> 01:31:46.126
- and I just left my job?
- Jeff isn't in this for the money.

01:31:46.418 --> 01:31:47.770
He's in this
to help fight abortion.

01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:49.505
He's willing to
cut into his Saturday

01:31:49.796 --> 01:31:51.632
and meet with us
tomorrow morning.

01:31:52.925 --> 01:31:55.427
Abby, meet Jeff.

01:31:55.719 --> 01:31:57.429
Jeff, meet Abby.

01:32:06.813 --> 01:32:09.066
So, they're claiming
that Planned Parenthood

01:32:09.358 --> 01:32:12.110
and its patients face
imminent, irreparable harm

01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:14.112
from confidential information

01:32:14.404 --> 01:32:16.740
you've improperly disclosed
or are about to disclose.

01:32:17.032 --> 01:32:18.700
That's nonsense.

01:32:18.992 --> 01:32:20.912
Well, they managed
to convince a judge otherwise.

01:32:21.119 --> 01:32:24.206
Our preliminary hearing
is in ten days.

01:32:24.498 --> 01:32:28.418
The attorneys for the plaintiff
are a big firm out of Houston.

01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:33.090
But I'm betting we'll see
some faces from D.C. as well.

01:32:33.382 --> 01:32:36.468
You're a big fish, and
the sharks are smelling blood.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.596
Oh, also, you should
prepare yourself

01:32:39.888 --> 01:32:41.807
that, uh, Megan and Taylor

01:32:42.099 --> 01:32:43.819
will be testifying
to a completely different

01:32:44.101 --> 01:32:46.061
set of facts than the ones
you've described to me.

01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:49.731
- They were my friends.
- Emphasis on "were."

01:32:53.527 --> 01:32:56.613
Okay, Abby, I'm going to
ask you a series of questions.

01:32:56.905 --> 01:32:59.533
Um, I want you to take
all the time you need

01:32:59.825 --> 01:33:02.786
to answer honestly and
think about them all you want.

01:33:03.078 --> 01:33:04.454
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:33:04.746 --> 01:33:06.786
Have you ever revealed
the identities of the doctors

01:33:06.915 --> 01:33:08.750
performing abortions
at the facility

01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:10.377
either to Shawn or anyone else?

01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:12.004
- No.
- No.

01:33:12.296 --> 01:33:14.216
You ever removed confidential
patient information

01:33:14.256 --> 01:33:17.050
from the building, either
physically or in digital form?

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:19.595
No.

01:33:19.886 --> 01:33:22.556
Have you ever taken or removed
anything from the building?

01:33:22.848 --> 01:33:25.142
Just an old vacuum cleaner.

01:33:25.434 --> 01:33:27.144
Uh, but the one
at the clinic broke,

01:33:27.436 --> 01:33:29.021
and we had a tight budget
for equipment,

01:33:29.313 --> 01:33:30.939
so I brought mine from home.

01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:33.817
But when I quit,
I wasn't gonna leave it there.

01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:37.237
That and a plant,
but my mom gave me the plant.

01:33:37.529 --> 01:33:38.905
Okay.

01:33:39.197 --> 01:33:42.242
Uh, did you threaten
Megan or Taylor

01:33:42.534 --> 01:33:44.995
if they didn't look to resign
from Planned Parenthood?

01:33:45.287 --> 01:33:47.539
No. How could I? I wasn't even
their boss anymore.

01:33:48.999 --> 01:33:50.500
Which brings me to my last

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:53.295
and most important question
for you.

01:33:53.587 --> 01:33:55.464
What aren't you telling me?

01:33:55.756 --> 01:33:58.216
- Nothing.
- You sure?

01:33:58.508 --> 01:34:00.761
Because if there's something
that you're hiding,

01:34:01.053 --> 01:34:03.180
I can guarantee
it will come out in court.

01:34:03.472 --> 01:34:06.850
So, if there's anything
that I need to know,

01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:09.478
now is the time to tell me
while we still have the time

01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:11.146
to figure out
how to deal with it.

01:34:15.942 --> 01:34:19.696
A while back,
curiosity got the best of me,

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:21.948
and I pulled
my own patient file.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.326
I couldn't resist.

01:34:24.618 --> 01:34:25.952
How come?

01:34:26.244 --> 01:34:28.580
I needed to see my baby.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.667
Is that a problem?

01:34:31.958 --> 01:34:33.460
Sure.

01:34:33.752 --> 01:34:36.192
For Planned Parenthood if they
try to make an issue out of it.

01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:37.934
I mean, trying to paint her
like a criminal

01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:39.675
for wanting to see
her own file?

01:34:39.966 --> 01:34:41.319
We can only hope
they're stupid enough

01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:42.594
to try something like that.

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:44.346
So, what's our defense?

01:34:44.638 --> 01:34:46.264
She's innocent.

01:34:46.556 --> 01:34:49.184
- That's it? That's our defense?
- Yep.

01:34:49.476 --> 01:34:51.436
We are so screwed.

01:34:51.728 --> 01:34:53.814
Abby, don't complicate
the issue.

01:34:54.106 --> 01:34:55.866
Look, the... their-their
complaint's emphasis

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:57.859
on potential future harm

01:34:58.151 --> 01:35:00.362
tells me they're light
on actual evidence.

01:35:00.654 --> 01:35:03.865
Let me make it easy for you.
They've got no case.

01:35:04.157 --> 01:35:06.159
You don't know these people
like I know them.

01:35:06.451 --> 01:35:08.245
Planned Parenthood
will go to any lengths

01:35:08.537 --> 01:35:10.789
to destroy someone
that they see as a threat.

01:35:11.081 --> 01:35:13.792
Abby, there are two words
in the English language

01:35:14.084 --> 01:35:16.461
that are very powerful if you
put them together in court.

01:35:16.753 --> 01:35:17.921
Do you know what they are?

01:35:20.799 --> 01:35:22.676
"Prove it."

01:35:26.263 --> 01:35:29.766
Trust me. I got this.

01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:32.561
<i>So there I was,
scared out of my mind.</i>

01:35:32.853 --> 01:35:35.272
<i>After all, it's not every day
you take on a corporation</i>

01:35:35.564 --> 01:35:37.691
<i>with global outreach
to 189 countries</i>

01:35:37.983 --> 01:35:40.986
<i>on every continent
except Antarctica.</i>

01:35:41.278 --> 01:35:44.781
<i>Jeff looked like he didn't have
a care in the world.</i>

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:49.369
<i>Shawn was nervous, Doug was
my rock, and my mom was...</i>

01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:50.996
Shawn!

01:35:51.288 --> 01:35:54.040
<i>...well, my mom.</i>

01:35:54.332 --> 01:35:56.877
Thank you for getting
my daughter out of there.

01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:59.463
Wow. And here I was afraid
that Abby was going home

01:35:59.755 --> 01:36:01.315
every Christmas
for the past eight years

01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:03.341
bashing this evil Shawn person.

01:36:03.633 --> 01:36:06.094
Oh, she did, but I read
between the lines,

01:36:06.386 --> 01:36:08.096
which is why I knew
I'd love you.

01:36:11.475 --> 01:36:13.226
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:36:13.518 --> 01:36:14.853
Okay, hugging is done.

01:36:15.145 --> 01:36:17.731
Let's go kick some ass.

01:36:18.023 --> 01:36:19.876
What are you
hoping for in today's outcome?

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:22.402
I would like to see
justice served, obviously,

01:36:22.694 --> 01:36:23.820
and for people to...

01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:25.530
I just want to go over there

01:36:25.822 --> 01:36:27.622
and tell those people
what is really going on.

01:36:27.699 --> 01:36:28.926
Well, you're not going to.

01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:30.285
You're under
a restraining order.

01:36:30.577 --> 01:36:31.995
Mm-hmm. So let me
get this straight.

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:35.081
First they sue us even though
we did nothing wrong.

01:36:35.373 --> 01:36:37.209
Next they gag us
with a court order.

01:36:37.501 --> 01:36:38.781
Then they hold
a press conference

01:36:38.835 --> 01:36:40.195
so they can say
whatever they want,

01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:42.420
and we're just supposed
to stand here and be quiet.

01:36:42.464 --> 01:36:43.464
That is not fair.

01:36:43.548 --> 01:36:45.842
"Fare" is something
you give a cab driver.

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:47.761
The law is something
entirely different.

01:36:48.053 --> 01:36:49.573
...sincerely regret
being forced

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:51.041
to take this matter
to the courts.

01:36:51.264 --> 01:36:52.891
It's the last thing
we wanted to do,

01:36:53.183 --> 01:36:54.243
but, honestly, our priority...

01:36:54.267 --> 01:36:56.027
Is it wrong that I just
want to go over there

01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:59.397
- and punch her in the face?
- Yes, Abby, it's wrong.

01:36:59.689 --> 01:37:01.191
That's my job.

01:37:01.483 --> 01:37:03.169
Okay...

01:37:15.413 --> 01:37:16.957
What is that?

01:37:17.249 --> 01:37:18.917
Their attempt
to intimidate us.

01:37:19.209 --> 01:37:21.837
- It's working.
- Don't let it.

01:37:22.128 --> 01:37:24.756
They're just muddying the water
to make it seem deep.

01:37:25.048 --> 01:37:27.217
It looks like
they brought the whole firm.

01:37:27.509 --> 01:37:29.511
So did we.

01:37:29.803 --> 01:37:31.555
Okay, here we go.

01:37:35.976 --> 01:37:38.854
Something about your lawyer
seemed familiar.

01:37:39.145 --> 01:37:40.397
And then I realized

01:37:40.689 --> 01:37:42.774
he's the guy
from the billboards, right?

01:37:44.234 --> 01:37:45.902
Well, good for you.

01:37:46.194 --> 01:37:48.822
Looks like you really are gonna
"get what you deserve."

01:37:55.704 --> 01:37:57.247
<i>In real life,</i>

01:37:57.539 --> 01:38:00.333
<i>sometimes things don't work out
the way we expect.</i>

01:38:00.625 --> 01:38:02.460
...in and for Brazos County

01:38:02.752 --> 01:38:04.045
is now in session.

01:38:04.337 --> 01:38:06.464
<i>If this were just a movie</i>

01:38:06.756 --> 01:38:08.717
<i>instead of the story
of my life,</i>

01:38:09.009 --> 01:38:11.094
<i>then this would be the part
where there'd be</i>

01:38:11.386 --> 01:38:13.013
<i>an epic battle
fought on my behalf,</i>

01:38:13.305 --> 01:38:14.848
<i>full of twists and turns</i>

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.517
<i>and a come-from-behind victory
at the last moment.</i>

01:38:20.562 --> 01:38:23.106
<i>But that's not what happened.</i>

01:38:23.398 --> 01:38:25.400
Mom.

01:38:25.692 --> 01:38:27.402
<i>And thank goodness for that.</i>

01:38:27.694 --> 01:38:29.821
<i>'Cause I don't think
I could have handled it.</i>

01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:36.953
You guys do know we won, right?

01:38:39.039 --> 01:38:41.833
<i>In the end,
it only took Jeff 58 minutes</i>

01:38:42.125 --> 01:38:44.377
<i>to convince the judge
that I was innocent.</i>

01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:47.464
<i>All of Planned Parenthood's
lies and accusations</i>

01:38:47.756 --> 01:38:49.090
<i>counted for nothing.</i>

01:38:49.382 --> 01:38:51.468
So tell me the truth.
Were you ever worried?

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.386
What? Me worry?

01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:55.558
I was sweating like the Devil
on Easter morning.

01:39:05.315 --> 01:39:07.817
- This isn't over.
- Uh, sure it is.

01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:10.028
Did you...
Were you not paying attention?

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.073
Oh, and by the way,
Abby told me what you said.

01:39:13.365 --> 01:39:16.242
And, yes, I am the guy
from the billboards.

01:39:16.534 --> 01:39:19.746
So, Abby did get what
she deserved, and so did you.

01:39:20.038 --> 01:39:22.582
And I'm the one who gave it
to you.

01:39:27.545 --> 01:39:30.507
Okay.

01:39:30.799 --> 01:39:32.133
<i>And that would've been</i>

01:39:32.425 --> 01:39:34.594
<i>the end of my story,
except for...</i>

01:39:39.224 --> 01:39:40.600
Hello?

01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:42.812
You're never gonna believe
what I just found out.

01:39:43.103 --> 01:39:44.437
The clinic is closing.

01:39:44.729 --> 01:39:47.399
- What are you talking about?
- The clinic.

01:39:47.691 --> 01:39:50.151
Planned Parenthood is
closing it down for good.

01:39:50.443 --> 01:39:52.654
- Shawn, are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:39:52.946 --> 01:39:55.031
I just got a memo
across my desk.

01:39:55.323 --> 01:39:57.033
<i>Shawn was right.</i>

01:39:57.325 --> 01:39:59.285
<i>Planned Parenthood of
Bryan, Texas, shut its doors</i>

01:39:59.411 --> 01:40:03.790
<i>for the final time
on August 1, 2013.</i>

01:40:04.082 --> 01:40:06.751
Bread.

01:40:07.043 --> 01:40:09.004
<i>To celebrate, we all decided</i>

01:40:09.295 --> 01:40:11.381
<i>to gather at the fence
one last time.</i>

01:40:11.673 --> 01:40:12.692
Tear it down!

01:40:12.716 --> 01:40:13.842
- Ready?
- Are you kidding?

01:40:14.134 --> 01:40:16.761
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

01:40:17.053 --> 01:40:18.813
Tear it down! Tear it down!

01:40:19.055 --> 01:40:21.307
Tear it down!

01:40:21.599 --> 01:40:24.436
Tear it down! Tear it down!

01:40:38.408 --> 01:40:42.829
In my hand, I hold two roses,

01:40:43.121 --> 01:40:45.874
one for each of
my own unborn children

01:40:46.166 --> 01:40:51.046
who I decided to sacrifice
on the altar of convenience.

01:40:51.337 --> 01:40:54.591
And I know I'm not the only one
who's made that mistake.

01:40:54.883 --> 01:40:58.344
Thousands of babies
were lost to abortion

01:40:58.636 --> 01:41:02.348
inside these walls,
including one of mine.

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.601
And today we remember them.

01:41:04.893 --> 01:41:05.977
We honor them.

01:41:06.269 --> 01:41:08.313
We vow never to forget them.

01:41:08.605 --> 01:41:10.982
So I'd like to invite you
to join me

01:41:11.274 --> 01:41:15.403
in placing a rose of your own
at the fence in memory of them,

01:41:15.695 --> 01:41:19.407
as proof that they are
not forgotten.

01:41:41.137 --> 01:41:44.474
You know, I wrote a letter
to you both.

01:41:49.145 --> 01:41:51.564
What it's about...
the words don't matter.

01:41:55.193 --> 01:41:57.487
Because all I want you to know
is that I love...

01:41:57.779 --> 01:42:00.281
I love you so much,

01:42:00.573 --> 01:42:02.700
and I'm sorry.

01:42:02.992 --> 01:42:06.704
I'm sorry that I didn't
fight for you,

01:42:06.996 --> 01:42:08.373
that I didn't love you
enough then

01:42:08.665 --> 01:42:10.542
to keep this from happening.

01:42:13.837 --> 01:42:16.464
And I think about you
every day.

01:42:22.095 --> 01:42:24.931
But I know that someday

01:42:25.223 --> 01:42:29.727
I'll meet you both in Heaven,
because God is merciful.

01:42:32.063 --> 01:42:35.775

and He has forgiven me.
