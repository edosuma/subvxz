WEBVTT

00:01.670 --> 00:03.940
- Sam! Sam, is that you?  - It's me. I'm okay.

00:03.940 --> 00:05.280
Listen to me. I don't know what you've heard,

00:05.280 --> 00:06.410
but I can explain it all.

00:06.420 --> 00:07.870
I just need to get home first.

00:07.870 --> 00:09.290
Marcus Chaplin has been deemed

00:09.290 --> 00:11.360
unfit for command, as has his X.O.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.820
Your government now considers them enemy combatants.

00:13.820 --> 00:16.050
You guys bug out of Pakistan with a wounded man.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.560
And a few hours later the U.S. is nuking the joint?

00:18.560 --> 00:19.900
How do you connect the dots?

00:19.900 --> 00:22.010
Marcus Chaplin claims that the nuke order

00:22.010 --> 00:25.360
sent to the "Colorado" came through the Antarctic Network.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.710
You're uniquely qualified to do something about this.

00:27.710 --> 00:30.400
Uniquely qualified to risk my own ass

00:30.400 --> 00:31.740
to help you save your daughter?

00:31.740 --> 00:33.770
Really think you can break that kind of devotion?

00:33.770 --> 00:36.110
Well, she's got faith. She's in love.

00:36.110 --> 00:37.240
Those things are curable.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.060
The government detained me!

00:39.060 --> 00:41.490
They are lying about what happened to the "Colorado"!

00:41.490 --> 00:45.350
I am a U.S. citizen, and I will not be silenced!

00:46.710 --> 00:49.120
Sedition, treason, terrorism.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.080
Not to mention you stole a U.S. warship

00:51.080 --> 00:53.430
and fired a nuclear weapon to Washington D.C.

00:53.430 --> 00:54.900
To prevent American b-1 bombers

00:54.900 --> 00:56.250
from annihilating my crew,

00:56.250 --> 00:57.600
and thousands of innocent civilians!

00:57.610 --> 01:01.570
You are currently holding 141 U.S. sailors against their will,

01:01.570 --> 01:04.080
71 of whom signed a list formally requesting

01:04.080 --> 01:06.190
that they be relieved of their duties on this island.

01:06.190 --> 01:07.070
Curry doesn't know that.

01:07.070 --> 01:09.000
These men have families, sir. They have wives.

01:09.000 --> 01:09.840
They have children.

01:09.840 --> 01:11.040
Military families who knew precisely--

01:11.040 --> 01:12.780
They didn't sign up for this!

01:13.330 --> 01:15.030
Are we still role-playing here?

01:15.030 --> 01:16.940
The mock debate was your idea. If it's not useful...

01:16.940 --> 01:19.120
It is useful. Ask yourself,

01:19.240 --> 01:21.620
why the sudden willingness to negotiate?

01:21.880 --> 01:24.050
China's rattling her sabers over Taiwan.

01:24.060 --> 01:25.630
And our little distraction is the last thing

01:25.630 --> 01:27.300
that this administration needs.

01:27.310 --> 01:30.340
We have one shot to get this right.

01:30.380 --> 01:31.750
In two hours, you'll be face-to-face

01:31.750 --> 01:33.290
with Secretary of Defense William Curry,

01:33.290 --> 01:36.340
who happens to be an extremely cunning son of a bitch.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.610
Control your feelings,

01:39.090 --> 01:41.720
or I guarantee Curry will control them for you.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.630
I only have beans for two more weeks.

01:55.630 --> 01:57.160
So if you're going to jump,

01:57.160 --> 01:59.810
please wait until I finish my cafe.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.230
No, I'm okay.

02:06.450 --> 02:07.830
I know. Don't say it.

02:08.310 --> 02:10.400
I, uh, I look like an ice cream man.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.810
I was going to say

02:11.810 --> 02:14.840
perhaps it's true what they say about a man in uniform.

02:16.890 --> 02:18.320
Well, company's coming.

02:19.370 --> 02:21.150
Captain wants to put on a show, so...

02:21.150 --> 02:23.870
I think this can only be good. You'll talk, they'll talk.

02:23.870 --> 02:26.940
They want their submarine, you want to go home.

02:26.940 --> 02:28.220
It's not that simple.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.250
Excuse me, sir.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.220
Ma'am, I think you should come down here.

02:35.470 --> 02:36.450
I'm glad you're here.

02:36.450 --> 02:38.360
We seem to have a bit of a catastrophic problem.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.260
I thought you said we're out of coffee.

02:40.260 --> 02:40.790
What is it?

02:41.020 --> 02:42.360
Array 31 pegged out

02:42.360 --> 02:43.960
and took down half the northern perimeter.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.670
What does that mean? What's he talking about?

02:45.750 --> 02:47.130
You see that string of green lights?

02:47.130 --> 02:49.170
That's our sonar array line.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.590
It keeps submarines from sneaking up and killing you.

02:51.590 --> 02:53.830
- Now, you see that part that's off?  - Yeah.

02:53.830 --> 02:56.960
That means that part is, uh, you know, off.

02:57.320 --> 02:57.990
This is the X.O.

02:57.990 --> 03:00.230
Man battle stations. Man battle stations.

03:00.230 --> 03:03.780
Possible enemy contact 26 miles from range point 42--

03:03.780 --> 03:05.360
It's not an attack.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.370
Hold that order. Stand by.

03:07.370 --> 03:08.240
Excuse me?

03:08.240 --> 03:11.080
The array was supposed to have its battery serviced last month.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.130
I-it's a dead battery? Are you kidding me?

03:13.770 --> 03:15.170
How long will it take for you to fix?

03:15.170 --> 03:17.820
The array's 300 feet below the surface, man.

03:17.820 --> 03:19.300
We don't fix it.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.320
Who fixes it?

03:20.320 --> 03:22.050
The United States navy.

03:22.590 --> 03:24.020
Should I get you the number?

03:28.160 --> 03:30.080
I'm gonna be with the captain in negotiations.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.650
So you're gonna take the "Colorado"

03:31.650 --> 03:32.940
and a small detachment.

03:32.940 --> 03:33.920
Diver, engineering,

03:33.920 --> 03:35.600
- sonar, weps--  - Yes, sir.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.160
Listen, we have every reason to believe

03:37.160 --> 03:38.490
that this is just a dead battery.

03:38.490 --> 03:41.210
But the same day that Curry and his entourage arrive,

03:41.270 --> 03:42.920
we can't rule anything out.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.110
So, you ready for your first command?

03:45.110 --> 03:46.670
Aye, aye. Won't let you down, sir.

03:46.670 --> 03:48.790
I know you won't. Dismissed.

03:49.070 --> 03:51.640
Daddy finally let you take the car out of the driveway?

03:52.020 --> 03:53.010
Don't worry, sir.

03:53.010 --> 03:54.360
I'll keep her out of trouble.

04:05.590 --> 04:07.340
- So where is he?  - James?

04:07.760 --> 04:09.130
I'm not his keeper.

04:09.570 --> 04:12.300
Well, maybe you could get petty officer King a message for me.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.580
A critical underwater sonar array has failed.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.029
And I'm tasked with leading the repair operation.

04:16.029 --> 04:18.430
So I need a diver-- a good one.

04:18.430 --> 04:20.180
One who's trained in trimix--

04:20.480 --> 04:21.740
Do you want to write this down?

04:22.900 --> 04:24.710
Fine. Two of the S.E.A.L.S in his unit,

04:24.710 --> 04:26.260
Fisher and Vogler, are certified deep solo.

04:26.260 --> 04:27.950
I need James to tell me which one's best.

04:27.950 --> 04:30.490
- You are joking, right? - Oh, look, I found him.

04:30.490 --> 04:32.460
Vogler's never been below 250.

04:32.460 --> 04:33.510
So Fisher it is, then.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.810
- You don't have to do this. - But I do.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.740
If the U.S. Navy finds out the array line's down,

04:37.740 --> 04:39.340
They'll drop 50 guys just like you

04:39.340 --> 04:41.190
to double-tap our skulls while we sleep, so--

04:41.190 --> 04:42.440
You need a diver.

04:43.010 --> 04:45.200
- I'm a diver. - You volunteering?

04:45.200 --> 04:47.690
I thought you were done with these people, James.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.170
We leave 0800. Get your gear.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.700
You know, that's the thing with these S.E.A.L. Boys.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.810
They'll do just about anything for a thrill.

05:04.950 --> 05:06.100
That's Curry, all right.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.150
Looks like we got 12 M.P.s with M4s.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.620
Sir, you're not gonna believe this.

05:15.540 --> 05:17.100
White House adviser Amanda Straugh.

05:17.110 --> 05:19.140
Good. It seems we have the president's full attention.

05:19.140 --> 05:20.650
No. Pan left.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.430
What the hell is Grace's father doing here?

05:24.430 --> 05:26.960
Oh, they think they're dealing with a gunman in a bell tower.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.490
They brought an old friend to talk me down.

05:33.660 --> 05:36.130
There's not a man among you who's not worried about his family,

05:36.140 --> 05:37.710
and how this is all gonna end.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.350
My orders to you are simple.

05:39.570 --> 05:40.600
Don't.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.040
Don't show these people your doubt.

05:43.050 --> 05:44.990
We are only as strong as we are unified,

05:44.990 --> 05:47.360
and only as unified as we appear to be.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.080
Show these people our resolve,

05:49.080 --> 05:51.220
and there's a chance for all of us to go home today.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.110
You heard the man! Fall in!

06:15.440 --> 06:17.580
I bring a message from your president.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.800
Any person who no longer wishes to be a party

06:20.800 --> 06:23.330
to this treasonous act,

06:23.330 --> 06:24.740
step forward now.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.310
We will protect you.

06:29.980 --> 06:31.170
Very well!

06:31.800 --> 06:33.360
So shall you hang.

06:36.010 --> 06:37.040
Admiral.

06:37.660 --> 06:38.680
Where's Marcus?

06:38.680 --> 06:39.790
He's waiting.

06:42.550 --> 06:43.890
Grace is fine, sir.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.240
I'm sorry. We didn't expect you to be here.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.800
She's currently embarked on the sub.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.980
Who's in command?

06:54.480 --> 06:55.760
Sit-rep, Master Chief.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.720
Interrogative, ma'am.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.540
Why is there a French girl on my boat?

07:00.730 --> 07:01.950
She's vital to the mission.

07:01.950 --> 07:03.110
Are we planning a retreat?

07:03.110 --> 07:04.780
- Do you have a report or not? - Yes, ma'am.

07:04.780 --> 07:07.300
C.O.B. reports that he's crewed canoes with more men than this.

07:07.300 --> 07:09.690
We've got our communications officer piloting the boat.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.550
We have six non-quals spread in between weapons and engineering.

07:12.560 --> 07:13.790
Maybe we can run, maybe we can fight,

07:13.790 --> 07:16.340
but we sure as shinola cannot run and fight.

07:16.340 --> 07:18.010
Thank you, Master Chief. That'll be all.

07:18.010 --> 07:19.890
Hope you folks brought your water wings.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.670
That will be all, C.O.B.

07:21.670 --> 07:25.120
Grace, you can stand on that conn till the Rapture comes.

07:25.550 --> 07:27.680
Still don't make you my captain.

07:33.350 --> 07:35.060
Mr. Cahill, make your depth 3-1-0 feet,

07:35.060 --> 07:37.620
10 degree down angle. And watch your cavitation.

07:37.620 --> 07:40.040
The fence is down. We may have uninvited guests.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.580
10 degree down angle, aye.

07:41.580 --> 07:42.970
Passing the trench now, sir.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.310
I mean, ma'am.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.000
Either will do, Mr. Cahill.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.620
How long do you expect to hold out here, Marcus?

07:48.620 --> 07:50.450
A month? Two? Four?

07:50.450 --> 07:52.490
Of course, you're losing people left and right.

07:52.490 --> 07:54.500
How long before the rest of these boys turn on you,

07:54.500 --> 07:56.060
break out the piano wire?

07:56.060 --> 07:58.130
Because they will. After the monsoons.

07:58.130 --> 08:00.860
Fields flood, starvation starts.

08:00.860 --> 08:02.380
Did you come with an offer or not?

08:02.380 --> 08:04.290
An offer? I came to clean up a mess.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.890
You launched a nuclear missile at your own country.

08:06.890 --> 08:09.980
You detonated two in Pakistan without a declaration of war.

08:09.980 --> 08:11.340
You fired a Tomahawk missile at your own--

08:11.350 --> 08:14.520
At a rogue submarine in contravention of direct orders, yes.

08:14.530 --> 08:17.390
Direct, unlawful, unconfirmed orders.

08:17.390 --> 08:18.560
I confirmed them!

08:18.560 --> 08:19.760
I meant by somebody with authority.

08:19.760 --> 08:24.260
Do not talk to me about your quaint ideas of right and wrong.

08:24.260 --> 08:26.870
We are not here because of your principles, son.

08:26.870 --> 08:29.730
We are here because of your failure--

08:29.760 --> 08:32.010
to do your duty, to follow orders,

08:32.010 --> 08:35.000
to simply turn a key and press a button.

08:35.169 --> 08:39.169
My God, a pair of chimpanzees could do what you conot.

08:39.179 --> 08:40.780
You want my offer?

08:41.130 --> 08:43.250
My offer is this--

08:44.780 --> 08:45.940
treason.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.540
Sam Kendal, Marcus Chaplin,

08:48.540 --> 08:49.440
Grace Shepard,

08:49.440 --> 08:51.930
and all officers present on the conn that day

08:51.930 --> 08:53.780
will appear before a military tribunal.

08:53.780 --> 08:55.040
What about my crew?

08:55.040 --> 08:57.170
Seven years each in a federal penitentiary.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.410
No parole.

08:58.470 --> 09:01.470
Now, we are willing to forego the death penalty

09:01.470 --> 09:02.980
in light of the circumstance

09:02.980 --> 09:06.420
regarding the unfortunate death of captain Chaplin's son Jeffrey.

09:07.490 --> 09:09.420
You want me dead, you want to silence me,

09:09.420 --> 09:10.620
you want to kill my crew?

09:10.620 --> 09:12.670
You had your shot, you son of a bitch! You missed!

09:12.670 --> 09:15.340
Look closely. I am not a politician.

09:15.340 --> 09:16.980
If you say my son's name again,

09:16.990 --> 09:20.250
I swear I will crush the jelly from your eyes.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.860
Okay. Easy, easy, easy.

09:21.860 --> 09:22.880
Easy!

09:25.360 --> 09:26.430
Easy.

09:27.470 --> 09:29.000
Get them down. We're okay.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.880
We're okay. We're okay.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.170
We're okay.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.290
He's not well, Sam.

09:40.290 --> 09:42.270
You still have something to live for.

09:42.270 --> 09:45.330
Don't tie it all to a man with nothing to lose.

09:53.350 --> 09:55.350
What the hell happened to "Show no emotion"?

09:55.350 --> 09:57.660
You're breaking your own rules, sir. I'd like--

09:57.660 --> 09:58.720
Sir!

10:00.620 --> 10:02.010
He pissed me off.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.630
He pissed you off?

10:04.370 --> 10:05.770
That is the one man right now

10:05.870 --> 10:07.670
who has the power to send us all back home!

10:07.670 --> 10:09.460
To send us to prison.

10:09.700 --> 10:10.800
It's a negotiation!

10:11.040 --> 10:12.530
We give a little, they give a little.

10:12.530 --> 10:13.930
- I know how it works. - Really?

10:14.040 --> 10:15.890
'Cause the man I saw in there seemed completely--

10:16.360 --> 10:17.190
Go on. Say it.

10:19.510 --> 10:21.940
I could do five years, sir. I could do six.

10:21.940 --> 10:23.750
- Stop it! - If it gets us back home,

10:23.860 --> 10:25.820
and no more people die, I could do it!

10:25.820 --> 10:26.990
Is that how you want this to end?

10:26.990 --> 10:28.480
It's not what I want, it's what I can get.

10:29.930 --> 10:30.750
Who taught me that?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.710
And what did I teach you about honor?

10:35.120 --> 10:37.660
You know I will follow you all the way down if you ask.

10:37.830 --> 10:40.020
But the apology you want is not coming, sir.

10:40.710 --> 10:42.620
That is the United States of America in there!

10:42.840 --> 10:44.950
And they do not apologize!

10:56.900 --> 10:59.270
Pay close attention to your air reserves.

10:59.430 --> 11:00.640
And watch the tether.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.330
It's our only communication.

11:02.570 --> 11:05.350
If you lose the tether, maintain your depth.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.330
If the current drags you up too quickly--

11:07.330 --> 11:09.010
I get bent. My joints explode.

11:09.010 --> 11:10.450
My brain embolizes. I've seen it.

11:10.740 --> 11:12.540
This isn't my first rodeo, okay?

11:12.670 --> 11:14.470
She don't know what a rodeo is, kid.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.390
- Oh, we have rodeo in France. - Nah.

11:17.750 --> 11:20.960
Oui. Horses, cows, cowboys.

11:21.490 --> 11:24.040
There's no such thing as a French cowboy, lady.

11:24.190 --> 11:25.800
French is the opposite of cowboy.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.340
Cowboy is like Will Rogers,

11:27.340 --> 11:29.350
John Wayne, Clint Eastwood.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.140
Robert Duvall?

11:30.580 --> 11:31.490
Now you're getting it.

11:31.610 --> 11:32.610
Duvall is French.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.240
You take that back.

11:34.590 --> 11:35.970
We're coming up on the array now.

11:35.970 --> 11:37.570
I want everyone sharp, at their stat--

11:37.950 --> 11:39.420
Tell me that's not the drill you're using.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.350
Yes.

11:40.580 --> 11:41.960
It looks like a jackhammer.

11:42.170 --> 11:44.390
The bolts in the battery casing are 10 inches long.

11:44.390 --> 11:45.490
No. Get him a wrench, C.O.B.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.170
A wrench? I'll suck down my first tank

11:47.170 --> 11:48.410
before I pull the first screw.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.720
You rev that thing out there, and any sub within 10 miles

11:50.720 --> 11:53.050
is gonna put a Mark-48 torpedo in our ear hole,

11:53.050 --> 11:53.980
and we'll all be dead.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.370
Why wasn't I told about this?

11:55.370 --> 11:58.640
It's the job of the captain to review all the mission assets.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.120
I was assigned this mission half an hour ago.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.040
Fine. Use the drill, but make it quick.

12:05.680 --> 12:06.210
What?

12:06.490 --> 12:08.270
You need to think this through, lieutenant.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.100
You let your ego drive the boat,

12:10.100 --> 12:11.660
people will get dead.

12:18.130 --> 12:19.530
You said Grace wouldn't be charged

12:19.530 --> 12:20.740
along with Marcus and Sam.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.980
And we'll reduce the charges against your daughter

12:22.980 --> 12:25.280
when you convince the captain to accept our terms.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.510
I've known Marcus for 30 years.

12:27.630 --> 12:29.190
He will stand on principle.

12:29.390 --> 12:31.410
Nothing I can say is going to change that.

12:31.550 --> 12:34.100
I have a message from Captain Butler of the "Illinois".

12:34.230 --> 12:36.850
He believes he's found a gap in their sonar array line.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.450
How long before he finds the "Colorado" and sinks her?

12:39.560 --> 12:41.420
Those are American sailors on that submarine.

12:41.420 --> 12:42.680
Some say they're criminals.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.590
Now I won't enjoy giving the fire order,

12:44.590 --> 12:46.450
but when the time comes, I will give it,

12:46.450 --> 12:47.540
just as you would.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.580
So convince your friend to settle.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.420
All right, I'm on the array.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.450
Good. Secure the tether.

13:01.670 --> 13:02.870
I'm starting the clock.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.830
Vis 100 feet. Can't see the boat.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.670
We're right below you, James.

13:06.800 --> 13:07.880
Proceed with repair.

13:08.030 --> 13:10.070
First remove the bolts from the battery casing.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.620
Damn it. Who heard that?

13:15.700 --> 13:16.250
Who didn't, ma'am?

13:16.250 --> 13:17.180
We have noise propagation

13:17.180 --> 13:19.140
above and below the thermal for 15 miles.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.600
All right, people, it's a party, and we just became the pinata.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.970
Petty officer King, as fast as you can, please.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.040
Are you trying to get us killed?

13:34.810 --> 13:35.720
Unbelievable.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.060
Mr. Kendal says you have an offer?

13:38.620 --> 13:41.130
I want a trial for me and my officers.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.160
Secret court-martial can certainly be arranged.

13:44.150 --> 13:45.370
You misunderstand.

13:45.370 --> 13:47.670
I demand a public trial in a civilian court

13:47.670 --> 13:48.820
cameras, jury,

13:48.960 --> 13:50.540
amnesty for my enlisted men.

13:50.540 --> 13:52.780
You really have lost your mind.

13:53.410 --> 13:55.140
Y-you said he was serious, Kendal.

13:55.140 --> 13:56.750
And only after you've agreed to those terms

13:56.750 --> 13:57.640
will we discuss the six

13:57.640 --> 13:59.770
navy S.E.A.L.S I picked up off the coast of Pakistan.

14:06.390 --> 14:07.930
Must be all this ocean air.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.550
I'm famished.

14:09.550 --> 14:10.630
Shall we break for lunch?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.310
Lunatic thinks this is a game.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.080
The "Illinois" is through the perimeter.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.290
Two 688i's inbound.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.970
Hunt her down.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.700
I want to know the moment you find that sub.

14:34.030 --> 14:35.490
James, check your pressure.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.080
Copy that. One more bolt.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.260
James, you need to hurry.

14:38.380 --> 14:39.060
Maybe they didn't hear it.

14:39.060 --> 14:40.340
Maybe they're in another sector

14:40.340 --> 14:40.870
and they didn't--

14:41.060 --> 14:43.800
New contact--2 688-class subs bearing 0-7-1,

14:43.890 --> 14:45.390
Range 16,000 yards.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.870
16k? They're too far away.

14:46.870 --> 14:47.700
With a little luck,

14:47.700 --> 14:48.800
we'll be outhere before they fi--

14:48.800 --> 14:50.240
New contact-- Virginia class.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.390
Much have come out of our baffles, ma'am.

14:51.570 --> 14:52.600
It's the "Illinois." She's close.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.820
You gotta dive the boat, lieutenant.

14:56.030 --> 14:57.470
No! He's still outside!

14:57.470 --> 14:59.230
Active sonar. She's looking for us.

14:59.230 --> 15:00.240
Dive the boat now.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.810
Quiet! I know what I'm doing.

15:01.810 --> 15:03.220
He's dead if we dive!

15:03.350 --> 15:05.190
Contact coming about. Heading 1-4-9.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.440
Grace.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.630
Helm, left full rudder! Emergency deep!

15:12.830 --> 15:14.130
take us down, Mr. Cahill.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.870
James, cut the tether. James?

15:17.370 --> 15:18.980
Do you copy? Cut the tether.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.680
What? No. I'm screwed without the tether.

15:22.840 --> 15:23.890
Don't do it!

15:25.510 --> 15:26.150
No!

15:44.130 --> 15:45.450
Passing test depth.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.110
Wait. Did he cut loose?

15:48.240 --> 15:49.610
We're at 1,400 feet, Sophie.

15:49.610 --> 15:51.490
If he's attached, he's dead. Now be quiet.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.180
Mr. Cahill, all stop 1500 feet.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.190
Hover the ship.

15:55.190 --> 15:56.460
Let's make like a hole in the water.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.550
Ma'am, I'm tracking two-- make that three contacts

15:58.550 --> 16:00.030
pinging actively at staggered depth.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.150
Search pattern. They got us covered.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.550
We move now, we die.

16:08.570 --> 16:10.350
Half the Middle East is up in arms.

16:10.530 --> 16:13.360
Riots in Bahrain, Oman, U.A.E.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.570
China's navy is amassing around Taiwan.

16:15.570 --> 16:17.610
And my voicemail is full of congressmen

16:17.610 --> 16:19.020
bitching about $8 gas.

16:19.130 --> 16:20.880
Maybe next time you guys nuke a country,

16:20.880 --> 16:21.570
you'll think it through.

16:21.570 --> 16:22.750
Well, it happened.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.430
And now it's up to people like you and me--

16:25.550 --> 16:26.810
responsible people.

16:26.810 --> 16:27.850
What do you want?

16:27.980 --> 16:30.240
Marcus Chaplin's wife died of cancer.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.460
One son K.I.A. in Afghanistan,

16:32.460 --> 16:34.270
the other son ran off to save the whales.

16:34.270 --> 16:36.410
Hasn't talked to Marcus in years.

16:37.010 --> 16:40.330
When a man loses everything, all he has left is his cause.

16:40.330 --> 16:41.820
So ask yourself--

16:42.640 --> 16:46.740
Is his cause still the same as yours?

16:46.740 --> 16:47.460
I'll see you inside.

16:47.610 --> 16:50.690
Look, I make deals, Sam. That's all I do.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.230
And the man I see-- I can tell you he doesn't want one.

16:54.450 --> 16:55.780
What he wants is martyrdom.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.320
Watch him. You'll see.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.770
Oh, I-I never thought we'd use those weapons.

17:06.250 --> 17:07.099
Not again.

17:07.730 --> 17:09.859
Now that we have, I don't even know why.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.430
Two days ago, 81 countries moved for

17:12.430 --> 17:16.240
a formal condemnation of the United States on the floor of the U.N.

17:16.420 --> 17:19.910
In D.C., I have almost half of the former joint chiefs

17:19.910 --> 17:22.230
ready to forcibly remove this president.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.500
And they're all counting on you to hold fast on this island

17:24.500 --> 17:26.650
until the time is right.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.300
To be part of the story that doesn't fit--

17:31.850 --> 17:34.660
the living, breathing symbol of the lie.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.740
I've wanted to be a lot of things, Arthur,

17:37.510 --> 17:39.200
but a symbol was never one of them.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.350
Oh, yeah? Well, we don't get to

17:40.350 --> 17:41.620
choose our fate, do we?

17:41.790 --> 17:43.510
If I have a chance to bring my people home today,

17:44.760 --> 17:46.120
I may have to take it.

17:46.260 --> 17:49.070
Yeah, well, I want my daughter home, Marcus. I do.

17:49.070 --> 17:51.180
But I don't know what that home is becoming.

17:54.710 --> 17:56.560
No, I don't need a reservation.

17:56.560 --> 17:59.170
That's my table always, right there.

17:59.490 --> 18:00.730
Uh, that table's reserved.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.410
I know it's reserved. It's reserved for me.

18:03.860 --> 18:05.160
I would like to speak with Rogelio.

18:05.580 --> 18:06.520
I'll wait.

18:06.790 --> 18:07.550
Excuse me.

18:16.750 --> 18:17.610
So you sleep with me,

18:17.610 --> 18:20.010
and then you steal my hard drive while I'm in the shower.

18:20.110 --> 18:21.530
That makes two times you screwed me,

18:21.530 --> 18:24.040
and I'm still not sure which was more disappointing.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.680
- Hi, Mimi. - Kylie. Hi.

18:26.680 --> 18:27.540
Catch a powder,

18:27.540 --> 18:29.560
or I'll erase you off every guest list in the city.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.290
Mimi Vanderholt?

18:34.420 --> 18:36.720
The girl is an accessory to her own handbag.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.820
You just don't know when to stop, do you?

18:38.820 --> 18:40.270
I'll stop when you make this right.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.030
Help me get my data back.

18:42.030 --> 18:43.920
Why can't you just play along like everyone else?

18:43.920 --> 18:45.130
Because it turns out everyone else

18:45.130 --> 18:46.410
is a backstabbing hypocrite.

18:46.410 --> 18:47.820
You were a backstabbing hypocrite.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.440
I liked that about you.

18:50.370 --> 18:51.230
What happened?

18:51.590 --> 18:52.940
It's too late. You're out.

18:53.390 --> 18:54.830
You just went from being us to being them.

18:55.060 --> 18:55.950
I'm gonna miss you.

18:56.720 --> 18:57.310
Excuse me?

18:57.990 --> 18:58.980
Get your hands off me.

18:58.980 --> 19:00.000
Could you come with me, ma'am?

19:03.050 --> 19:03.910
Now.

19:11.600 --> 19:12.220
This way.

19:14.650 --> 19:17.210
They're lying about what happened to the "Colorado"!

19:17.340 --> 19:20.430
I am a u.S. Citizen, and I will not be silenced!

19:21.800 --> 19:24.270
I want the truth, and you should, too!

19:24.520 --> 19:26.180
They ever gonna stop showing this nut job?

19:26.810 --> 19:28.410
Why aren't you reporting about them, huh?

19:28.580 --> 19:30.060
The government detained me!

19:30.060 --> 19:31.400
They are lying about--

19:32.440 --> 19:33.920
It's never gonna stop, is it?

19:34.810 --> 19:35.650
No.

19:36.030 --> 19:37.150
That's what makes it so hard.

19:45.010 --> 19:46.740
I know what it's like to find out the person we love

19:46.740 --> 19:47.840
isn't who we thought they were.

19:47.840 --> 19:48.600
What is this?

19:48.730 --> 19:50.150
What does this mean, "potential buyer"?

19:50.270 --> 19:53.100
The government has 32 e-mails that are encrypted

19:53.100 --> 19:54.880
between Sam and Marcus Chaplin,

19:54.880 --> 19:56.500
detailing their plan to defect to China

19:56.620 --> 19:57.870
and sell the "Colorado."

19:57.980 --> 19:59.500
That's insane. Sam would never do--

19:59.500 --> 20:00.950
We can lose somebody and never know.

20:01.050 --> 20:02.230
They go away, they come back,

20:02.230 --> 20:03.480
some part of them doesn't return.

20:03.580 --> 20:04.880
Some part that they kept secret,

20:05.010 --> 20:07.190
- maybe even to themselves, until the moment-- - Stop.

20:09.410 --> 20:11.870
Please just... Just stop.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.190
Sam was different when he came home

20:15.190 --> 20:16.260
from North Korea, wasn't he?

20:27.820 --> 20:29.300
Used to do this when I was a kid.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.070
Cape fear. My daddy was a crab man.

20:32.710 --> 20:33.850
I find that hard to believe.

20:33.970 --> 20:35.950
What, that I come from humble folk?

20:36.910 --> 20:38.050
That you were ever a child.

20:39.710 --> 20:42.140
You know, I think you like me more than you let on.

20:44.180 --> 20:46.430
No? Well, I like you.

20:47.470 --> 20:48.850
I think some part of me even admires

20:48.850 --> 20:49.890
what you're trying to do here.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.830
Carving out your own little piece of the world.

20:52.090 --> 20:52.930
Is that what you want?

20:53.570 --> 20:54.670
'Cause I could give that to you.

20:54.890 --> 20:55.810
You know what I want.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.200
God, you're a stubborn man.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.450
You want your day in court.

20:58.630 --> 21:00.700
Do you have any idea what's happening out there?

21:01.610 --> 21:03.230
You got the ball rolling, Marcus.

21:03.230 --> 21:04.250
It's all up for grabs now--

21:04.400 --> 21:06.950
Alliances shifting, frontiers opening up.

21:07.050 --> 21:08.670
You're moving the third fleet towards Taiwan.

21:09.140 --> 21:10.270
Will it be enough?

21:10.270 --> 21:11.240
Suddenly you could use

21:11.240 --> 21:12.660
the ships you've got blockading my island.

21:12.810 --> 21:15.100
All you have to do is give me the chance

21:15.100 --> 21:16.330
to tell the truth in open court.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.340
We are reshaping the face of this planet,

21:18.460 --> 21:20.590
and you want to stand on a soapbox

21:20.590 --> 21:21.670
and plead for the truth?

21:22.360 --> 21:24.190
You think that makes you a hero? It doesn't.

21:24.300 --> 21:25.330
It makes you a fool.

21:25.780 --> 21:26.880
Because in the end,

21:26.880 --> 21:30.110
the truth is gonna be whatever we say it is.

21:30.380 --> 21:32.840
And this place, you, these people

21:32.960 --> 21:34.740
are gonna be a little footnote

21:34.850 --> 21:37.210
in a story about how a broken nation

21:37.440 --> 21:40.160
asserted itself in the cause of freedom

21:40.280 --> 21:42.150
and became a great empire once again.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.980
What you did to Pakistan...

21:45.620 --> 21:47.680
Do you ever wonder how history will judge you?

21:51.140 --> 21:53.640
God... It's so beautiful here, isn't it?

22:13.120 --> 22:15.310
Sir, are you honestly taking a nap right now?

22:16.120 --> 22:18.910
Well, Curry knows that delay heightens tension in one's opponent.

22:19.030 --> 22:20.660
Anxiety begets uncertainty.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.570
You really should breathe, Sam.

22:22.570 --> 22:23.650
I'm breathing.I am breathing.

22:23.650 --> 22:24.580
I'd like to keep it that way.

22:24.690 --> 22:26.120
It gives us time to doubt the possibility

22:26.120 --> 22:27.280
of our desired outcome.

22:27.740 --> 22:30.070
We doubt, we settle for less.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.710
And when exactly do we say yes?

22:32.330 --> 22:33.470
What's our bottom line?

22:35.100 --> 22:36.920
You know what it is.

22:37.180 --> 22:38.370
I want to hear you say it.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.240
To go home.

22:41.090 --> 22:41.650
They're coming.

22:42.680 --> 22:43.700
What is it, Arthur?

22:43.900 --> 22:46.240
Something's up. There's a lot of radio chatter,

22:46.240 --> 22:47.690
and Straugh's on the sat phone.

22:47.690 --> 22:49.090
My daughter's out there.

22:49.210 --> 22:51.630
Your daughter has become a very capable officer, Arthur.

22:51.740 --> 22:52.490
She can handle it.

22:52.630 --> 22:54.570
My apologies for the delay.

22:55.010 --> 22:57.370
I have with me here an offer.

23:05.250 --> 23:05.900
Very well.

23:05.900 --> 23:08.010
Your President was feeling generous.

23:08.550 --> 23:10.040
He has authorized...

23:14.810 --> 23:15.660
Don't react.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.570
The E.W.S. reports three fast attack submarines

23:18.570 --> 23:20.140
circling Grace's last known position.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.470
If they've found her--

23:23.060 --> 23:25.790
If they had found her, we'd already be dead.

23:26.220 --> 23:27.600
Are we boring you, captain?

23:27.990 --> 23:30.220
Yes. But I'm listening.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.700
He's got nine minutes of air left.

23:33.990 --> 23:35.450
Still searching active sonar, ma'am.

23:35.570 --> 23:36.870
They bounce a ping off our hull.

23:36.870 --> 23:39.260
They're gonna come down here and punch our clock for good.

23:39.380 --> 23:40.450
It's just a matter of time.

23:40.450 --> 23:41.860
I know the score, C.O.B. Thank you.

23:42.090 --> 23:43.120
James is still up there.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.140
He could be alive.

23:44.140 --> 23:45.320
If we make a break for James now,

23:45.420 --> 23:47.110
there's a good chance those attack subs hear us.

23:47.110 --> 23:48.250
I can't outrun them.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.300
We wait for them to bug out.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.520
You think you can decide who lives and who dies?

23:51.620 --> 23:52.120
You're not God.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.940
On this ship, I am.

23:54.770 --> 23:56.270
And if anyone else has a problem with that,

23:56.270 --> 23:58.000
you're more than welcome to step outside.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.370
Ever blown the tanks on a boomer, Mr.Cahill?

24:05.500 --> 24:06.980
Not from this depth, ma'am, no.

24:06.980 --> 24:07.610
You'll do fine.

24:07.740 --> 24:08.550
Just watch your bubble.

24:08.550 --> 24:09.530
There'll be some debris.

24:09.530 --> 24:10.150
Debris, ma'am?

24:10.280 --> 24:11.670
If we can get this boat up to firing depth,

24:11.670 --> 24:13.390
we show them our teeth, we force them to back off.

24:13.390 --> 24:15.150
Chief of the boat, you tell your men to ready torpedo tubes

24:15.150 --> 24:16.980
one through four in all respects.

24:17.090 --> 24:19.220
You can't shoot it out with fast attack submarines.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.150
Do you need me to repeat the order?

24:22.750 --> 24:23.600
No, ma'am.

24:23.800 --> 24:24.650
Good.

24:27.030 --> 24:27.810
What's happening?

24:28.150 --> 24:29.960
Captain's got sand in her swimsuit,

24:30.360 --> 24:33.150
so we're all headed to the le gran rodeo in the sky.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.610
You runaway bastards probably can't hear me,

24:43.850 --> 24:45.440
the battery packs are going in now,

24:47.110 --> 24:48.620
so... you know, you're welcome.

24:49.150 --> 24:50.800
I'll just be here waiting for my ride.

24:55.090 --> 24:56.230
That is really good.

24:56.640 --> 24:57.820
You don't have to say that.

24:57.820 --> 25:00.240
No, I mean it. Really, that's really good.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.200
Who taught you to cook?

25:02.210 --> 25:04.340
- My wife. - You're married?

25:04.340 --> 25:07.660
I'm not. I just can't bring myself to say the "ex" part yet.

25:07.660 --> 25:09.870
- Sorry. - That's all right.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.770
Two years ago. Had to learn how to feed myself.

25:12.770 --> 25:14.150
Learn how to do a lot of things, actually.

25:14.150 --> 25:16.820
It's surprising how much you can come to rely on someone.

25:17.290 --> 25:18.360
When Donna left,

25:18.450 --> 25:20.030
took me a long time to remember who I was.

25:20.030 --> 25:22.040
It's strange, you can fall so far into a person

25:22.040 --> 25:23.690
that you just sort of disappear.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.600
You kind of become the space around them,

25:25.600 --> 25:26.660
and when they leave it's like,

25:26.660 --> 25:28.210
"Well, now that she's gone,

25:28.480 --> 25:30.990
do I even exist?" You know?

25:33.420 --> 25:35.290
I could stay the night if you want.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.970
N-not like that. I-I just meant in the guest room

25:38.970 --> 25:40.900
- If--if you...  - You can't ask that.

25:40.900 --> 25:44.190
Yeah, I know, I... I'm sorry.

25:44.390 --> 25:46.290
Uh... You'll be all right here?

25:47.990 --> 25:48.920
Okay.

25:56.110 --> 25:57.610
I've tried to help you here.

25:57.610 --> 25:59.760
The president's given you an honorable way out.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.480
This president doesn't know the meaning of the word.

26:01.480 --> 26:04.400
Be careful, sir. You are dealing with people's lives.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.890
In fact, I imagine our presence here

26:05.890 --> 26:07.420
has become rather inconvenient for him.

26:07.420 --> 26:08.490
For all of you.

26:08.490 --> 26:11.470
Our president currently enjoys a 68% approval rating, so--

26:11.470 --> 26:12.680
I'm sure he does.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.210
George Bush I won Desert Storm

26:14.210 --> 26:15.660
on 28 February 1991.

26:15.660 --> 26:17.950
21 months later, he was voted out of office.

26:17.950 --> 26:20.380
So don't talk to me about polls. I want my trial.

26:20.380 --> 26:22.670
And who do you think's going to believe a traitor?

26:22.670 --> 26:26.640
Oh, I have hard evidence of the whole sordid thing--

26:26.640 --> 26:29.840
from my new navy S.E.A.L. pals.

26:30.740 --> 26:32.770
No, you don't.

26:32.770 --> 26:35.030
You should have killed those S.E.A.L.s when you had the chance.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.560
Amnesty for your crew and junior officers.

26:46.560 --> 26:49.380
You return my submarine, my S.E.A.L.S.

26:49.380 --> 26:52.500
You and the X.O. plead guilty to a violation of Article 92.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.900
Two years protective custody.

26:56.080 --> 26:56.990
No.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.660
- Sir, can we take a break and discuss... - No.

27:01.660 --> 27:02.950
18 months.

27:03.340 --> 27:05.550
- Captain-- I want a public trial, Mr. Curry.

27:05.550 --> 27:06.900
That's never gonna happen.

27:06.900 --> 27:07.910
So be it.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.500
I'll invite the cameras here and try you

27:10.500 --> 27:12.140
and the president in absentia.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.450
Coming?

27:20.180 --> 27:21.950
Did you ever give a damn about getting home?

27:21.950 --> 27:22.920
Sam, if you have objections--

27:22.920 --> 27:24.600
Maybe you have nowhere to go, but I do.

27:25.130 --> 27:27.620
And so does your crew. And, what, you're just gonna let them all burn

27:27.620 --> 27:28.980
for the sake of your damn truth?

27:28.980 --> 27:30.150
My truth?

27:31.040 --> 27:32.470
My truth?!

27:33.610 --> 27:36.110
Sam, new offer. Get my boat back,

27:36.110 --> 27:37.760
and I promise you and Grace Shepard

27:37.760 --> 27:39.760
will never see the inside of a prison.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.220
I will guarantee your safety in the country of your choice

27:42.220 --> 27:44.050
with your beautiful wife.

27:44.050 --> 27:46.720
Don't let him drag you down with him, Sam.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.090
Doesn't get better than this.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.290
You got a deal.

27:58.550 --> 28:00.730
You put that in writing, you got your sub back.

28:00.730 --> 28:02.900
Deal. Let's get out of here. Come on! Let's go!

28:51.510 --> 28:52.420
This is the Captain.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.080
My father once told never never to bet

28:54.080 --> 28:55.620
more than I was willing to lose.

28:55.620 --> 28:57.470
By now, you all know my intentions.

28:57.470 --> 29:01.140
I mean to engage our enemy and put this vessel in harm's way.

29:01.820 --> 29:04.150
Every life on this boat will be at risk.

29:05.790 --> 29:07.480
It's more than I'm willing to lose.

29:07.540 --> 29:08.870
But I'm not betting on this boat,

29:08.880 --> 29:11.600
I am betting on you, because you sailors

29:12.000 --> 29:13.430
are a sure thing.

29:14.220 --> 29:15.190
Carry on.

29:16.920 --> 29:17.970
Here they come.

29:17.980 --> 29:19.620
2,800 yards to target.

29:19.620 --> 29:22.370
Mr. Cahill, all ahead flank on my mark.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.130
Mark.

29:34.030 --> 29:36.930
20 knots. 21.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.190
- 22 knots. - We're cavitating.

29:39.190 --> 29:41.040
- What does that mean? - That means company's coming.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.990
Mr. Cahill, up angle, 30 degrees.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.910
Contact, bearing 1-1-7,

29:44.910 --> 29:46.680
range 5,000 yards. She's coming about.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.460
- On your horse, Mr. Cahill. - Aye, ma'am. 23 knots.

29:49.810 --> 29:50.990
Come on, girl.

29:51.890 --> 29:53.070
I need you up here, C.O.B.

29:53.070 --> 29:54.570
New contact, 4,100 yards!

29:54.570 --> 29:56.260
It's the "Illinois." Bearing 2-1-3.

29:56.260 --> 29:57.380
Ma'am, she's acquiring.

29:59.540 --> 30:00.740
You provoked me.

30:00.820 --> 30:02.380
You wanted me to react.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.520
Yes. To get the best deal.

30:06.580 --> 30:07.960
To get you and Grace home.

30:07.960 --> 30:10.030
I was under the impression that we trust each other.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.640
I trust your instincts, Sam.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.590
Curry was never gonna go all the way unless he could split us.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.210
Negotiation is theater.

30:16.210 --> 30:18.510
I had to be certain your emotion would be read as real.

30:19.430 --> 30:20.880
It was real.

30:23.820 --> 30:24.880
I know.

30:26.250 --> 30:29.450
Secret executive order number 1349.

30:29.670 --> 30:31.830
I trust you'll find it to your liking.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.480
We do not care where you go.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.010
We do not care what you do.

30:35.010 --> 30:37.890
But if you breathe a word about any of the events of the past week,

30:37.890 --> 30:39.700
this agreement shall be void,

30:39.700 --> 30:40.940
and so shall you.

30:40.980 --> 30:42.570
Can you abide by these terms?

30:42.900 --> 30:43.670
I can.

30:43.670 --> 30:47.640
You shall be remanded immediately to our custody for court-martial.

30:47.640 --> 30:48.790
I'll go willingly.

30:48.790 --> 30:50.730
I ask only that I be allowed to address my crew.

30:50.730 --> 30:51.970
Of course.

30:53.010 --> 30:54.710
- What are you doing? -This offer has expired.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.130
- What?! - Mr. Secretary.

30:56.130 --> 30:58.280
Excuse me, where are you going? We had a deal!

30:59.090 --> 31:00.430
- What the hell just happened? - I don't know.

31:00.430 --> 31:02.690
Captain Butler has a firing solution on the "Colorado."

31:02.690 --> 31:03.890
Awaiting your order.

31:03.890 --> 31:05.710
Kill her. Kill her now.

31:05.710 --> 31:07.420
Captain Butler, Amanda Straugh.

31:07.420 --> 31:11.330
Authentication 0-1-2-2--

31:13.930 --> 31:15.850
hold your fire! Hold your fire!

31:15.970 --> 31:16.920
come on. Come on!

31:16.920 --> 31:17.750
"Illinois" is standing by.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.470
Awaiting confirmation of fire order.

31:19.470 --> 31:21.510
We have the shot now, ma'am. Ma'am?

31:21.520 --> 31:23.250
"Illinois" Closing. 3,000 yards.

31:23.250 --> 31:26.090
Dive, 30 degrees up angle! Helm right full rudder!

31:26.090 --> 31:27.110
Shake that son of a bitch.

31:27.110 --> 31:28.910
Coming about 30 degrees off our starboard quarter.

31:28.910 --> 31:30.410
He's got us dead to rights, ma'am.

31:30.410 --> 31:30.940
Distance to target?

31:30.940 --> 31:33.190
- 1,400 yards, ma'am. - We're not gonna make it.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.930
At least we won't die dry.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.500
- 1,300 yards to target!  - Why haven't they fired?

31:36.500 --> 31:38.190
- Mechanical failure. - On both ships?

31:38.190 --> 31:39.660
Well, maybe they don't want to hit a girl.

31:39.660 --> 31:42.170
- How did you ever stay married? - Stayed deployed.

31:42.170 --> 31:45.110
Maintaining 1,200 yards. Both contacts still back there!

31:47.740 --> 31:49.660
Nobody's this lucky. Somebody bought us time.

31:49.660 --> 31:51.860
Let's not waste it. Open doors one, two, and three.

31:51.860 --> 31:53.320
Aye, aye. Doors open.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.230
Closing on target. Ma'am, we got a shot.

31:55.230 --> 31:57.510
Ready torpedoes. On my order.

31:57.810 --> 31:59.850
Ahh! I need a radio!

31:59.850 --> 32:01.330
Get me a radio!

32:02.970 --> 32:05.950
Captain Butler, this is secretary of defense William Curry!

32:05.950 --> 32:07.580
I order you to fire!

32:07.580 --> 32:08.980
Fire!

32:13.080 --> 32:14.470
Torpedoes away. Target acquired.

32:14.470 --> 32:15.900
Ma'am, "Illinois" Just opened her doors.

32:15.900 --> 32:18.380
She's gonna shoot. "Illinois" Torpedo in the water!

32:18.420 --> 32:19.950
- Went active right out of the gate. - Where are my fish, C.O.B.?

32:19.960 --> 32:21.550
Seven seconds to impact.

32:21.550 --> 32:25.680
Five... Four... Three... Two...

32:26.130 --> 32:27.290
One.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.980
Left full rudder, up angle 20 degrees!

32:35.980 --> 32:37.310
Take me into the debris, Mr. Cahill!

32:37.310 --> 32:39.120
Left full, up 20, aye!

32:44.330 --> 32:45.790
Chief Pitts, where are those torpedoes?

32:45.790 --> 32:47.310
Tracking wide, ma'am. It's lost us.

32:47.310 --> 32:51.030
Helm all stop! Emergency blow all main ballast tanks!

32:51.030 --> 32:52.360
600...

32:52.530 --> 32:53.700
550...

32:54.260 --> 32:56.680
450... Secure the blow! Mind your bubble!

32:56.680 --> 32:59.830
300... 200 feet. Approaching firing depth.

32:59.830 --> 33:01.440
Sonar, contacts? Are they tracking?

33:01.440 --> 33:03.810
Negative, ma'am. It worked.

33:03.810 --> 33:05.070
We left them down there circling the plume.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.890
Level off. Open my missile doors.

33:07.890 --> 33:09.910
Stand by for E.H.F. transmission.

33:13.780 --> 33:17.430
Attention to all forces in the area of Sainte Marina.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.110
This is the captain of the S.S.B.N. "Colorado."

33:20.110 --> 33:21.690
As you can see on your satellites,

33:21.690 --> 33:22.740
our doors are open,

33:22.860 --> 33:25.800
and we have four nukes spun up and aimed at D.C.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.340
Kindly remove your forces from the 200-mile perimeter.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.270
Thank you for your cooperation.

34:15.969 --> 34:17.310
I have a gun.

34:20.739 --> 34:21.520
Sorry about the pop-in.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.730
Only way to dodge the news vans out front.

34:23.730 --> 34:25.699
- Who the hell are you? - Kylie Sinclair.

34:25.699 --> 34:26.830
I believe the administration

34:26.830 --> 34:28.670
set your husband up, Mrs. Kendal.

34:28.670 --> 34:31.679
And if you're willing to help me, I can prove it.

34:35.620 --> 34:36.940
You want some coffee?

34:39.480 --> 34:40.969
Any sign of life?

34:43.620 --> 34:44.780
No, ma'am.

34:52.150 --> 34:53.920
I used to drink with this senior chief

34:53.920 --> 34:56.070
at Subic named Disco.

34:56.070 --> 34:57.790
We must have hit every

34:57.790 --> 34:58.370
hooch hole in Olongapo,

34:58.370 --> 35:01.330
till one night Disco fell in with this little honey-ko

35:01.330 --> 35:02.870
from the boom boom bar.

35:03.310 --> 35:05.200
And I'm not talking some 4-day marriage.

35:05.200 --> 35:09.220
I'm... I'm talking actual, factual love.

35:09.220 --> 35:10.640
That's beautiful, C.O.B.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.410
End of liberty, Disco was flat broke,

35:12.410 --> 35:14.000
and honey-ko was gonna cut him off,

35:14.000 --> 35:14.980
but I'm a romantic.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.530
So I tell Disco I'll give him 10 bucks

35:16.530 --> 35:18.700
for every minute he holds his head in the koi pond.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.280
Cost me 50.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.210
Is there a point to this story?

35:22.600 --> 35:25.860
Point is, he was a navy S.E.A.L.

35:27.420 --> 35:28.830
There! Did you hear that?

35:28.830 --> 35:30.240
Uh, ma'am...

35:31.150 --> 35:32.370
I think maybe...

35:33.850 --> 35:34.800
Tapping?

35:37.870 --> 35:38.550
Very faint, but...

35:38.550 --> 35:40.140
Yes!

35:40.380 --> 35:41.650
That's morse code. 50 feet.

35:41.660 --> 35:43.560
- Port side, 20 degrees. - On that heading!

35:43.560 --> 35:46.060
All stop. Stand by to retrieve.

35:47.660 --> 35:49.060
What's he saying?

35:49.060 --> 35:51.300
You don't want to know, ma'am.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.190
So what is it you do, exactly?

36:07.220 --> 36:09.070
It's what I did that matters.

36:09.070 --> 36:12.520
I put a very unique piece of equipment on Sam's submarine,

36:12.520 --> 36:14.490
and I believe this equipment recorded information

36:14.500 --> 36:15.730
that certain powerful people would like

36:15.730 --> 36:18.410
to keep very secret.

36:18.410 --> 36:19.530
So where is it?

36:20.080 --> 36:21.880
Stolen... by a secret cabal

36:21.880 --> 36:23.980
as part of a government cover-up.

36:23.980 --> 36:25.110
Trust me, I know exactly...

36:25.110 --> 36:26.170
I believe you.

36:26.170 --> 36:29.040
Good, because I intend to flush every one of these rats

36:29.040 --> 36:31.090
into the light.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.580
But here's the thing.

36:32.970 --> 36:37.960
My, um, access is a bit limited at the moment.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.400
So that's where you come in.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.530
What do you want me to do?

36:42.480 --> 36:45.950
I want you to make some noise.

36:45.950 --> 36:47.840
I know how frightening this must all be for you.

36:47.840 --> 36:48.870
All right.

36:48.870 --> 36:50.420
I wouldn't ask--

36:50.420 --> 36:52.840
I said all right. I'll do it.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.710
But I want something, too. My lawyer, Paul Wells--

36:55.710 --> 36:57.910
He's an old friend of Sam's, and he's been...

36:57.920 --> 37:00.700
amazing helping me through all this.

37:00.700 --> 37:03.070
- Okay. - But he's a government agent

37:03.070 --> 37:05.640
sent to spy on me and turn me against Sam.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.930
How do you know?

37:08.380 --> 37:11.630
Because the other woman always knows.

37:11.790 --> 37:13.560
The truth is, I've shared my husband

37:13.560 --> 37:16.130
every single day of this marriage.

37:16.970 --> 37:19.420
Sam Kendal is in love with his country,

37:19.420 --> 37:21.700
for better or worse, in sickness and in health,

37:21.710 --> 37:24.250
and he would never betray her.

37:25.180 --> 37:28.090
Not for money. Not for anything.

37:29.730 --> 37:31.260
Not even me.

37:32.630 --> 37:34.580
"Colorado" reports mission accomplished.

37:34.590 --> 37:37.110
Ship and all hands in good condition.

37:37.180 --> 37:38.550
Ready to anchor.

37:43.910 --> 37:45.740
I clocked you at six minutes past reserves.

37:45.750 --> 37:47.250
How did you do that?

37:48.600 --> 37:50.990
I just told my body you'd left it for dead.

37:51.830 --> 37:54.140
It was a tough call, King.

37:54.140 --> 37:55.300
I'm glad you're back.

37:58.780 --> 38:00.050
How tough?

38:07.800 --> 38:09.350
Ten-hut!

38:10.370 --> 38:12.060
Officer on deck!

38:23.200 --> 38:25.240
They tried to sink the sub, sir.

38:25.420 --> 38:27.240
They broke the 200-mile line.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.330
Yes, they did.

38:28.330 --> 38:29.740
So how are we gonna respond?

38:31.290 --> 38:32.240
We're not.

38:32.690 --> 38:34.050
A senior white house adviser

38:34.050 --> 38:35.410
was killed here today, sir.

38:35.410 --> 38:37.220
The secretary himself took a bullet.

38:37.220 --> 38:39.760
No, he didn't. Curry knows the game.

38:39.820 --> 38:41.650
Never admit to being attacked unless you're prepared

38:41.650 --> 38:43.170
to pay the price for your response.

38:43.170 --> 38:45.720
So... this never happened,

38:46.330 --> 38:47.700
and they were never here.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.180
What are you gonna tell Grace about her father?

38:52.690 --> 38:54.110
How would you want to hear it?

38:54.290 --> 38:55.770
Straight up and quick.

39:05.240 --> 39:08.230
The four and nine missiles were fired

39:08.230 --> 39:10.330
from China's Hunan Province...

39:10.330 --> 39:11.810
Captain on the conn.

39:11.820 --> 39:14.100
...Landed in their target area off the coast of Kaohsiung.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.790
The remaining missile almost

39:15.790 --> 39:17.470
flew over Taipei's airspace before landing...

39:17.470 --> 39:20.020
Please give Lieutenant Shepard and me the conn.

39:30.010 --> 39:31.660
Grace, this is about your father.

39:35.390 --> 39:37.620
We're closing early.

39:37.980 --> 39:39.430
I was hoping you'd say that.

39:44.570 --> 39:46.630
You were gone longer than I...

40:05.300 --> 40:06.860
Drink it while you can.
