Her name is Alicia Reynaud.

00:02.957 --> 00:04.434

She's corporate elite.

00:04.438 --> 00:05.871
[FIVE]
You think she's the one

00:05.872 --> 00:07.305
who had my friends
killed over this?

00:07.308 --> 00:10.376
It's a key that allows
someone to access pockets

00:10.378 --> 00:12.378
of interdimensional space-time.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.079
This is my brother.

This is my only choice.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.220
No.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.688
There is another way.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.724
Ah! [gasps]

00:33.467 --> 00:35.467
[TABOR] Look, this is all
just a giant misunderstanding!

00:35.469 --> 00:37.102
The funds should have
been deposited directly

00:37.104 --> 00:38.437
into your account!

00:38.439 --> 00:40.406
[ALDVIK growls]

00:40.408 --> 00:43.108
It was a clerical error!
Come on, Aldvik!

00:43.110 --> 00:44.676
You're-You're-You're, like,
one of my best earners!

You're the last guy I'd rip off!

Oh, Portia...

Hah... What a

01:35.162 --> 01:36.328
Hey.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.129
How you feeling?

01:37.131 --> 01:38.530
Rough.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.653
Sorry about your brother.

01:43.654 --> 01:45.204
I was wondering if you could
give me a little something.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.239
To help you sleep?

01:47.241 --> 01:49.241

get through the day,

[NYX]
What do you mean, "No"?

01:54.715 --> 01:55.814
We just restocked.

01:55.816 --> 01:56.999
[DEVON] Yeah, we did.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.183
But these meds are
for clinical use,

01:58.185 --> 02:00.719
not recreational use.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.387
You serious?

02:02.389 --> 02:03.906
[DEVON]
Look,

02:03.907 --> 02:05.424
taking stuff is not gonna
get rid of your problems.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.392
It's just gonna replace 'em
with bigger ones.

02:07.394 --> 02:10.162
Trust me, self-medicating's
not the answer.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.731
Well, I guess you'd know.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.634
I spent way too much
time in lockup.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.737
You think I don't know
a user when I see one?

02:22.710 --> 02:24.543
[DEVON sighs]

02:24.545 --> 02:26.678
You think you got me
figured out?

02:26.680 --> 02:27.746
Hmm?

02:29.517 --> 02:31.917
[DEVON] You think you know
everything I've been through?

02:33.521 --> 02:34.586
Do you think
that I like the way

02:34.588 --> 02:36.655
that things have
turned out for me?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.690
Hmm?

02:38.692 --> 02:41.693
Yeah, I'm a user.

02:41.695 --> 02:44.730
So I know what I'm talking about
when I say it's not worth it.

02:44.732 --> 02:48.467
Just give me
what I came for.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.281

Hey!

03:19.867 --> 03:21.366
Why don't you
cut off his pinky?

03:21.368 --> 03:22.768
See how he reacts.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.870
[TWO chuckles]

03:24.872 --> 03:27.372
All right.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.907

03:28.909 --> 03:30.809
--[THREE laughs]
--[TABOR gasping]

03:30.811 --> 03:32.477
What if I'd actually
been unconscious?!

03:32.479 --> 03:33.679
Well, then I guess
we'd be looking

03:33.681 --> 03:35.480
mighty foolish right now,
wouldn't we?

03:35.482 --> 03:36.481
Surprised to see me?

03:36.483 --> 03:38.650
Yeah, surprised!

03:38.652 --> 03:40.252
And relieved.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.820
Thank God you're all okay.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.288
Wow.

03:43.289 --> 03:44.755
That's an interesting response,
considering you're the one

03:44.758 --> 03:46.325
that tried to set us up.

03:46.327 --> 03:46.959
What do you mean?

03:48.329 --> 03:49.394

What? No-no-no-no!

Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, wait.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.597
He set us up!

03:51.599 --> 03:53.432
I was as much of
a victim as you guys.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.717
In fact, now I'm like
a double victim,

03:54.718 --> 03:56.001
being accused of
something I didn't do.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.437
And if you don't mind me
saying so, it's rather hurtful.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.339
[GRIFFIN] Look, we're here
for one of two things:

04:00.341 --> 04:03.742
information or revenge.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.776
Who gets to pick?

04:04.778 --> 04:06.133
You do.

04:06.134 --> 04:07.489
[TABOR] In which case,
we'll go with the former,

04:07.490 --> 04:08.845
because, of course,
if there's anything I can do

04:08.849 --> 04:09.982
--to help you guys--
--Alicia Reynaud.

04:09.984 --> 04:10.882

venture capitalist,

04:10.884 --> 04:13.018
ruthless criminal, bad news.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.453
We're going after her.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.704
Why?

04:15.705 --> 04:16.954
[GRIFFIN]
'Cause she came after us first.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.690
But, why?

04:19.960 --> 04:21.110
Oh, come on!

04:21.111 --> 04:22.261
[TWO]
How do we get to her?

04:22.263 --> 04:23.629
[TABOR]
You can't!

04:23.630 --> 04:24.996
She only travels by clone.
Transfer transit.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.265
She never leaves
her headquarters,

04:26.267 --> 04:28.600
that-that place
is like a fortress.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.835
That's how we get in.

04:29.837 --> 04:30.869
How?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.471
The same way she gets out.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.605
All right,
you're coming with us.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.507
Get up.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.059
Where to?

04:37.060 --> 04:38.610
We scored big on our last op.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.811
We're going shopping.

Come on.

04:42.271 --> 04:43.526
[TABOR] You know,
we never officially ended

04:43.527 --> 04:44.782
our professional relationship,
so, technically,

04:44.785 --> 04:46.551
I'm owed commission on that.

looking good in here.

Well, glad I could help you
source these materials.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.766

left for me to do

05:00.768 --> 05:02.801
than to wish you all
best of luck

05:02.803 --> 05:05.037
and to bid you a fond adieu.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.538
You're not going anywhere.

I mean, I-I gotta
get back to work.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.978
I mean, I got-I got
people depending on me.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.396
Yeah, right.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.813
What's to stop you
from informing Reynaud

05:15.816 --> 05:17.449
and collecting
some kind of snitch reward

05:17.451 --> 05:18.583
for your troubles?

05:18.585 --> 05:20.152
[chuckles]

05:20.153 --> 05:21.720
Oh, well, my, uh,
professional responsibility

05:21.722 --> 05:22.688
as your handler.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.789
[GRIFFIN]
We fired you.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.558
Hey, no paperwork was signed!

05:26.560 --> 05:28.327
Come on, guys!
You're, like, my best clients!

05:28.329 --> 05:29.761
I mean, from a purely
practical standpoint,

05:29.763 --> 05:30.929
it doesn't make
any sense financially

05:30.931 --> 05:33.365
for me to screw you over.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.667
So, we... we good?

05:35.669 --> 05:36.535
Yeah.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.569
[TABOR]
Ah.

05:37.570 --> 05:38.602
You're still coming with us.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.906
Oh, fine.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.675
Well, this brings to mind
the response of the hunter

05:43.677 --> 05:46.778

in the Sanskrit epic<i> Ramayana</i> .

06:14.641 --> 06:15.752
You're welcome.

06:15.753 --> 06:16.864
[GRIFFIN]
You were supposed to stop him,

06:16.865 --> 06:17.976
not try and take his head off.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.444
[groans]

06:19.446 --> 06:21.079
[GRIFFIN] No, no, it's okay.
We got this. No.

06:24.451 --> 06:25.717
[THREE]
Come on.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.485
[ALL grunt]

06:26.487 --> 06:27.853
I don't travel well.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.838
'Cause even with
the inertial dampers,

06:29.839 --> 06:31.822
all the ins and outs
of FTL makes me queasy.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.125
I have a special bracelet--

06:33.127 --> 06:35.060
Let's go to your quarters.

06:58.452 --> 07:03.522
[door beeps]

07:06.927 --> 07:08.527
Yeah?

07:14.968 --> 07:16.601
May I come in?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.136
Sure.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.911
You may find this
hard to believe,

07:25.913 --> 07:29.514
but I once considered myself
an outsider on this ship.

07:30.117 --> 07:34.152
Yeah, well, um, I've been
on my own for a long time.

07:34.154 --> 07:38.623
This... whole team thing
takes a bit of getting used to.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.891
In that respect,
you're no different

07:39.893 --> 07:41.726
than anyone else onboard.

07:41.728 --> 07:45.096
We can all empathize with
what you're going through.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.832
Really?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.934
So you've all
lost brothers, too?

07:48.936 --> 07:53.038
Not exactly, but we did
recently lose a crew member.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.541
Five told me about it.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.777
[THE ANDROID] He wasn't
technically a family member,

07:58.779 --> 08:00.612
but losing him was very...

08:02.716 --> 08:05.484
...difficult.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.952
I'm sorry.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.524
Do you not think you'll ever
see your brother again?

08:12.526 --> 08:14.793
I'll never give up hope.

08:14.795 --> 08:19.531
[THE ANDROID] Well,
remember... you're not alone.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.796
And when I came back,
the apartment looked like this,

08:51.798 --> 08:53.164
and he was gone.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.001
We had plans tonight--
dinner, the opera.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.602
Those tickets were
really hard to get.

08:57.604 --> 08:58.803
[OFFICER A] Well, I understand
you're very concerned

08:58.805 --> 09:00.572
about Mr. Calchek's well-being,

09:00.574 --> 09:02.307
and I can assure you
we'll do all we can.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.808
Yeah, whatever.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.877
I'm sure he'll turn up,
and when he does,

09:05.879 --> 09:07.679
he's gonna have
to make it up to me.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.549
I had to scramble to find
a replacement date for tonight.

09:10.551 --> 09:11.950
I got it.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.020
[OFFICER B]
This is the security cam

09:15.022 --> 09:17.956
from the station's
L-3 level hangar.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.824
Recognize any
of these other people?

09:19.826 --> 09:20.959
No, I...

09:20.961 --> 09:22.561
[KIERKEN]
That's all right.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.065
I know who they are.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.107
Ha!

09:36.109 --> 09:37.576
You cracked transfer transit?

09:37.578 --> 09:39.010
Oh, I did that
about an hour ago.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.812
Then I cross-referenced
the dates and times

09:40.814 --> 09:43.682
of Alicia Reynaud's public
appearances over the last month

09:43.684 --> 09:47.786
with the transit database,
and came up with this...

09:47.788 --> 09:50.121
...matching point of departure.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.007
[TWO]
Her headquarters.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.892
And the subspace address
of her transit pod.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.961
Well, can you unlock it?

09:57.164 --> 10:00.031
I just disabled
its security protocols.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.900
We're in.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.301
You're good.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.345
So for all we know,
we could be transferring

10:13.347 --> 10:15.146
into a room full of guards?

10:15.148 --> 10:17.048
It's possible, but unlikely.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.084
[FIVE] The odds of someone
being able to hack into

10:19.086 --> 10:21.853
the transfer transit database,
localize a specific pod's

10:21.855 --> 10:24.289
address, and bypass
its security protocols

10:24.291 --> 10:27.192
to gain access are super slim.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.727
Are you showing off?

10:28.729 --> 10:30.362
[FIVE]
Wh-- No!

10:30.363 --> 10:31.996
I'm just pointing out how
tricky it can be to pull off

10:31.999 --> 10:35.266
something like this and...
Yeah, I guess I am.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.835
[GRIFFIN laughs]

10:36.836 --> 10:38.403
Worst-case scenario,
someone on the other side

10:38.405 --> 10:41.373
kills our clones or stops
the transfer process midstream.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.158
Then at least we'd know.

10:43.159 --> 10:44.942
[FOUR] And we'd need to
come up with another plan.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.778
This plan's fine.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.914
So, who's going?

10:49.916 --> 10:51.249
Well, we've got three pods.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.050
I'll take one.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.118
No, you won't.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.386
Why not?

10:54.387 --> 10:55.653
[GRIFFIN]
Those pods are designed

10:55.654 --> 10:56.920
to replicate organic material,

10:56.921 --> 10:58.187
which means that your
nanites won't make the trip.

10:58.191 --> 11:01.292
[FOUR] Without them,
your clone might not make it.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.894
I'll go.

11:04.231 --> 11:07.032
We-- You'll need me
to hack into their server,

11:07.034 --> 11:09.067
get the information
we're looking for.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.219
Besides, I'll be a clone.

11:11.220 --> 11:13.370
The real me will stay nice
and safe back on the ship.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.006
[FOUR] We also won't
be able to bring weapons,

11:15.008 --> 11:17.342
so we'll need someone
capable in unarmed combat.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.110
That would be me.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.945
I'll accompany her.

11:20.947 --> 11:21.880
So will I.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.114
Well, I don't think so.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.182
Why not?

11:24.184 --> 11:25.450
'Cause you're still
on probation.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.185
That's why not.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.086
So what?

11:28.088 --> 11:29.821
You're volunteering?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.292
I guess I am.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.226
[TWO]
All right.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.828
You three get suited up.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.230
We will meet you in
the infirmary in 20 minutes.

12:00.887 --> 12:01.953
What?

12:01.955 --> 12:04.055
Your outfit.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.157
It's very snug.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.459
[FIVE giggles]

12:07.461 --> 12:09.127
[TWO] They're made from
a biosynthetic material

12:09.129 --> 12:10.962
that will allow them
to travel with you.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.831
[THE ANDROID]
They're specialty constructs.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.399
DNA sequenced.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.935
It's quite expensive.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.337
Yeah, well, it's clingy
in all the wrong places.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.039
It's either that
or you could travel naked.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.307
I can do that?

12:22.309 --> 12:24.175
Don't even think about it.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.745
Let's do this.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.030
All right.

12:28.031 --> 12:29.314
Now, this is just
a fact-finding mission,

12:29.316 --> 12:31.983
so once we find out
what this card does and how,

12:31.985 --> 12:33.707
get outta there.

12:33.708 --> 12:35.430
If your clones get
taken down before you return

12:35.431 --> 12:37.153
to one of these pods, you're
not gonna remember a thing.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.758
Now, if you get cut off
from one of the transfer pods,

12:39.760 --> 12:41.443
Six and I will be
in the Marauder

12:41.444 --> 12:43.127
circling the skyways
above the facility.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.097
If anything goes wrong,
you find a way to signal us.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.266
If all else fails,
we'll be scanning the rooftops

12:48.268 --> 12:49.400
for any heat signatures.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.002
Get up there and
we'll pull you out.

12:51.004 --> 12:51.770
We good?

12:51.772 --> 12:52.303
Yup.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.339
I'll go first.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.940
--Good luck.
--Yeah.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.883
It's so... snug.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.262
He's through.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.265
Okay. My turn.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.300
Ready?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.902
Yeah.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.211
Good luck, Five.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.146
Thanks.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.581
This is so cool.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.307
[FIVE grunts]

14:02.309 --> 14:03.908
Wow.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.212
Come on, let's go.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.547
Uh, no, we don't
have to go anywhere.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.616
I just need a computer
that'll give me access

14:11.618 --> 14:13.918
to this facility's servers.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.553
This is perfect.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.990
I'll hack in,
get the information we need,

14:18.992 --> 14:21.125
never have to leave this room.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.361
Okay.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.929
Is there anything we can do?

14:24.931 --> 14:27.198
Um, sure.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.600
Grab me those cookies.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.043
Thanks.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.388
[TABOR]
Hey!

14:50.390 --> 14:52.991
Hey! Can anyone hear me?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.192
Hey!

14:54.194 --> 14:56.027
Come on!

14:56.029 --> 14:57.262
Hey--

14:57.264 --> 14:58.663
Oh, hi there!

14:58.665 --> 15:00.332
Hello.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.000
[TABOR] I-I-I've been in here
screaming at the top of my lungs

15:02.002 --> 15:03.902
for, like, half an hour!
Took you long enough to notice!

15:03.904 --> 15:05.904
Oh, I noticed
quite some time ago.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.972
I just assumed you'd
give up eventually.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.641
You're annoyingly persistent.

15:09.643 --> 15:10.942
Thank you.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.310
How can I help you?

15:12.311 --> 15:13.677
Well, you can start
by letting me outta here.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.681
[THE ANDROID] I'm afraid I can't
do that for safety reasons.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.683
Oh, come on. You actually
think I could hurt you?

15:18.685 --> 15:21.552
No, but I'm sure
I could hurt you,

15:21.554 --> 15:23.688
should you attempt to flee
or jeopardize this mission.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.390
Well, I don't-- I wouldn't--
I wouldn't-- Wait--

15:25.392 --> 15:27.258
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait! Look, look.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.092
Can I talk to someone?

15:28.094 --> 15:29.594
Uh, Portia, Boone?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.696
I'm afraid no one
is available.

15:31.698 --> 15:32.864
Just wait! Wait, wait!

15:32.865 --> 15:34.031
Hang on! Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

15:34.034 --> 15:36.234
Fingers, fingers, the fingers!

15:36.236 --> 15:37.886
I'm-I'm claustrophobic.

15:37.887 --> 15:39.537
Confined spaces like this,
they trigger my panic attacks.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.606
I mean, being in here
puts me at a health risk.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.242
Your heart rate is elevated.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.328
Ooh.

15:46.329 --> 15:48.413
[THE ANDROID] Very well. You can
accompany me to the infirmary.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.898
Great.

15:49.899 --> 15:51.382
[THE ANDROID] However,
should you attempt to escape

15:51.384 --> 15:55.486
or otherwise interfere,
I cannot guarantee your safety.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.455
Be-Best behavior. Promise.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.190
I'm also hypoglycemic,
so, um, maybe we could

15:59.192 --> 16:00.525
stop by the mess,
grab me something to eat?

16:00.527 --> 16:01.192
[THE ANDROID]
No.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.961
[TABOR sighs]

16:10.637 --> 16:12.236
[THREE]
Hm?

16:18.578 --> 16:19.610
Whoa.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.579
"Whoa," what?

16:21.581 --> 16:24.649
Oh, man, I knew this wasn't
gonna be as easy as you thought.

16:24.651 --> 16:28.219
No. I found out what
the mystery device does.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.420
It's part of a drive.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.621
[THREE]
You mean, like an engine?

16:30.623 --> 16:32.090
We already have one of those.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.324
Not like this.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.726
They call it a "Blink Drive."

16:34.728 --> 16:36.661
It creates
transversible wormholes

16:36.663 --> 16:39.998
by accessing pockets of
extra-dimensional space-time.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.466
And you lost me.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.434
[sighs]

16:43.436 --> 16:46.637
Normal FTL creates a distortion
in space that moves faster

16:46.639 --> 16:49.674
than the speed of light,
pulling the ship along with it,

16:49.676 --> 16:52.610
but you're still moving
from point A to point B.

16:52.612 --> 16:56.280
With the Blink Drive, you don't
technically move at all.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.782
You just disappear
from one place

16:57.784 --> 17:01.185
and reappear somewhere else
instantaneously.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.521
If we wanted to go all the way
across the galaxy,

17:03.523 --> 17:07.091
it would normally take us...
months with refueling stops

17:07.093 --> 17:08.793
along the way.

17:08.795 --> 17:12.096
With this, we could do it
in the blink of an eye.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.632
[FOUR] A fleet of warships
equipped with this... drive

17:14.634 --> 17:16.601
would be unstoppable.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.668
Yeah.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.104
That's right.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.073
No wonder she's willing
to kill for it.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.647
I don't get it.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.715
How does one little card
move a ship across the galaxy?

17:31.718 --> 17:35.153
Uh-- The card fits into an
adapter which you can attach

17:35.155 --> 17:38.356
to the control systems
of any ordinary drive.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.358
[FOUR] You're saying we could
turn the Raza's engines

17:40.360 --> 17:42.093
into one of these Blink Drives?

17:42.095 --> 17:43.294
We need the adapter.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.296
It's in a lab...

17:47.667 --> 17:51.602
...four stories up, on the
other side of the building.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.204
Let's go.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.549
All right, I've locked us
into an auto-flight pattern.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.551
Scanning for heat signatures.

18:06.553 --> 18:09.387
If anyone shows up on
the roof, move us in fast.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.788
You got it.

18:19.699 --> 18:24.769
[grunting]

18:26.706 --> 18:28.306
[FIVE grunts]

18:35.181 --> 18:36.581
[THREE]
Huh?

18:38.384 --> 18:39.717
[FOUR]
Come on.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.721
[FIVE]
Seriously?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.123
[THREE]
Aww.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.524
You look like
a widdle scientist.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.758
[FIVE groans]

18:47.760 --> 18:48.943
Are you okay?

18:48.944 --> 18:50.127
Yeah, just a little sore.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.401
How goes the op?

19:01.774 --> 19:04.542
Everyone's in play.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.410
Now we can only wait.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.813
Right.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.581
You know there are
chairs to sit on

19:10.583 --> 19:13.518
and cups to drink
from in the mess.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.320
Well, this is kind of
an impromptu picnic.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.455
[chuckles]

19:17.457 --> 19:18.723
I was on my way
to my quarters,

19:18.725 --> 19:22.827
and... this thing caught my eye.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.830
It's kind of amazing
when you think about it.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.465
I mean, they went
in with the weight

19:27.467 --> 19:29.167
of the universe
on their shoulders,

19:29.169 --> 19:32.670
and they came out
free and clear.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.239
Hardly.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.408
Their memories
may have been wiped,

19:37.410 --> 19:40.444
but their past still exists.

19:40.446 --> 19:43.247
And the past has a way
of catching up with you,

19:43.249 --> 19:45.249
whether you remember it or not.

19:45.251 --> 19:48.286
[DEVON]
Yeah, I get that.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.821
I mean, we all gotta pay
for it in the end, right?

19:50.823 --> 19:56.761
But if I could get
a fresh start, huh?

19:56.763 --> 19:59.230
Even if it's just up here...

19:59.232 --> 20:00.665
You wanna change?

20:00.667 --> 20:02.900
Make better choices.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.769
Starting from today.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.338
[chuckles]

20:07.340 --> 20:10.641
It... It's not that easy.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.311
I didn't say
it would be easy.

20:15.915 --> 20:19.283
I killed a girl once.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.319
She was 12 years old.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.559
[sighs]

20:30.330 --> 20:33.764
I was a ship's doctor
on a colonist run.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.435
[DEVON]
Easy job.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.904
Plenty of time
to feed my habit,

20:39.906 --> 20:44.575
until we came out of FTL
and ran into a meteor storm...

20:44.577 --> 20:48.813
...and the ship
just about came apart.

20:48.815 --> 20:55.353
I mean, there was...
explosions and fire,

20:55.355 --> 20:58.956
and suddenly I'm staring
at a dozen wounded people.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.892
You were high.

21:01.894 --> 21:05.763
Yeah.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.466
I took care of most of them.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.569
Patched them up.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.438
And then they
brought in this girl.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.410
[sighs]

21:19.412 --> 21:24.048
God, she was in,
uh, rough shape.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.383
She had third degree burns.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.652
She had internal injuries.

21:27.654 --> 21:32.290
And, I mean,
I-I coulda saved her.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.892
Only I got the shakes.

21:34.894 --> 21:38.863
So I gave myself a little
top-up before surgery.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.333
[DEVON sighs]

21:42.335 --> 21:44.568
Turns out it was a
little too much.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.042
She never made it off the table.

21:56.349 --> 21:57.748
I'm sorry.

21:59.552 --> 22:02.537
[sniffs]

22:02.538 --> 22:05.523
I tried to, um, stay clean
for about six months after that.

22:05.525 --> 22:10.828
I just... kept seeing
her face everywhere.

22:16.002 --> 22:20.438
Well, blocking something out
is no way to move on.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.406
I've been realizing that myself.

22:24.911 --> 22:28.579
Which is why I was on my way
to bring you these back.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.660
You know...
as soon as they came out

22:42.662 --> 22:45.563
of those pods, they went
looking for their past.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.999
From the sound of it, what they
found wasn't too pretty.

22:49.001 --> 22:53.070
Now they've got no choice
but to deal with it.

22:53.072 --> 22:56.674
So... I guess we're all
in the same boat.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.731
[FIVE]
Wow...

23:20.733 --> 23:22.466
[THREE]
Yeah.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.001
I'm assuming this is it.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.908
So we just take it?

23:31.677 --> 23:34.645
[FOUR] Well, there don't appear
to be any safeguards in place.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.714
No.

23:36.715 --> 23:38.782
Guys, this entire
facility is a safeguard.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.785
We're in the vault.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.454
[THREE]
Hmm.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.855
All right.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.811
I think we're good.

23:49.812 --> 23:51.996

23:51.998 --> 23:53.381

23:57.136 --> 23:58.519

--[COMPUTER] Incorrect.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.212
[SECURITY GUARD]
Drop your weapon!

24:08.214 --> 24:10.614
You're surrounded!

24:10.616 --> 24:12.016
[THREE]
Give, give, give, give!

24:14.220 --> 24:16.921
Okay, kid, I don't like this
any more than you do,

24:16.923 --> 24:18.522
but you're gonna
have to leave us behind.

24:18.524 --> 24:19.590
Go!

24:22.829 --> 24:24.061
[SECURITY GUARD shouts]

24:24.063 --> 24:25.396
Ah!

24:25.397 --> 24:26.730
The important thing for you
is get up to the roof,

24:26.732 --> 24:28.666
get the device back to the ship.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.736
Ahh!

24:32.738 --> 24:34.672
I don't want any argument
out of you, all right, kid?

24:34.674 --> 24:36.540
[FOUR]
You know she's gone, right?

24:36.542 --> 24:37.708
[THREE]
Oh, son of a--

24:37.710 --> 24:39.109
[THREE grunts]

25:10.543 --> 25:11.942
[gasps]

25:15.982 --> 25:18.849
Oh, come on. Seriously?

25:18.851 --> 25:20.618
You're finally awake.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.752
Took you long enough.

25:21.754 --> 25:22.786
Sorry I slept in.

25:22.788 --> 25:24.088
I didn't realize
we were in a rush.

25:24.090 --> 25:27.925
[THREE grunts]

25:27.927 --> 25:28.826
[sighs]

25:28.828 --> 25:30.728
Okay, what's the plan?

25:30.729 --> 25:32.629
I think I can free us,
but it will require me

25:32.632 --> 25:34.598
to dislocate both shoulders.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.233
Okay, do what you
gotta do, huh?

25:36.235 --> 25:37.618
All right.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.002
Once we're free, I'll pop
your shoulders back in

25:39.005 --> 25:40.771
for you, okay?

25:40.773 --> 25:42.139
No, no-not mine.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.858
Yours.

25:43.859 --> 25:45.576
Whoa, whoa, hang on a second.
Can we discuss our options?

25:45.578 --> 25:47.211
Uh--

25:47.213 --> 25:50.614
[REYNAUD]
Gentlemen, I'm Alicia Reynaud.

25:50.616 --> 25:54.118
And you are Marcus Boone
and Ryo Ishida.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.087
Or a version of them anyway.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.223
I know you hacked
my transit code,

25:59.225 --> 26:02.826
used the pod to break in here,
and stole the adapter.

26:02.828 --> 26:03.994
And I'd like to thank you.

26:03.996 --> 26:06.030
Well, you're welcome.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.515
For what?

26:07.516 --> 26:08.999
[REYNAUD] Because the adapter is
useless without the final card,

26:09.001 --> 26:11.569
which I believe
is onboard your ship.

26:11.571 --> 26:14.038
And as long as the transit
connection that brought you here

26:14.040 --> 26:17.708
remains open,
my men can trace the signal.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.310
Why don't you just
make a new card?

26:19.312 --> 26:22.746
I'd love to, but unfortunately
it's a one-of-a-kind prototype.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.683
[THREE] Which means you didn't
develop the tech, you stole it.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.952
Of course I did.

26:27.954 --> 26:31.355
So... I will find
your ship, eventually.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.957
But you could save me
a lotta time

26:32.959 --> 26:35.025
and yourselves a lotta trouble
if you just give me

26:35.027 --> 26:36.627
the coordinates.

26:36.629 --> 26:40.064
Now, if by trouble,
you mean death or torture,

26:40.066 --> 26:43.000
you're forgetting that
these are clone bodies.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.602
You can't really hurt us.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.070
That's where you're wrong.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.805
You see, the same way
that you were able

26:47.807 --> 26:51.008
to target my transit pod,
I'm able to do the same

26:51.010 --> 26:53.711
in reverse, sending
a powerful subspace

26:53.713 --> 26:56.080
charge back the way you came.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.916
And if your bodies are still
in their transmission pods,

26:58.918 --> 27:01.151
which I'm willing
to bet they are,

27:01.153 --> 27:04.088
the charge will,
in layman's terms,

27:04.090 --> 27:06.056
fry your brains.

27:06.058 --> 27:10.060
As for hurting you, well,
this is Mr. Ostrander.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.929
He's a specialist in the field.

27:11.931 --> 27:17.001
See, these bodies may be cloned,
but they still do feel pain.

27:19.372 --> 27:20.705
[REYNAUD sighs]

27:20.706 --> 27:22.039
I think I'll do it both ways.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.875
I'd like to cover my bases.

27:24.877 --> 27:28.212
I'll check back soon and see
if you've had a change of heart.

27:39.025 --> 27:42.993
You know, there's something
different about you.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.862
From the first time we spoke?

27:44.864 --> 27:46.997
No. From other service androids.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.699
[THE ANDROID]
Yes. I get that a lot.

27:48.701 --> 27:51.335
I'm thinking some kind of,
uh, black market upgrade?

27:51.337 --> 27:52.770
What makes you say that?

27:52.772 --> 27:54.004
Oh, I dabble
in black market upgrades

27:54.006 --> 27:55.673
and assorted illegal tech.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.808
Enough to recognize one
when I see one.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.260
Interesting.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.711
You seem to be running
some sort of, uh,

28:00.713 --> 28:02.846
emotive subroutine,
but those are usually uploaded

28:02.848 --> 28:04.448
to more sophisticated models.

28:04.450 --> 28:08.118
You know, caregivers,
parental proxies, "companions."

28:08.120 --> 28:09.319
In your case, that
doesn't make any sense.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.222
No offense.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.824
None taken.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.726
[TABOR]
So who did it, and why?

28:15.728 --> 28:16.894
I don't know.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.179
I mean, when you think about it,

28:18.180 --> 28:19.463
it's an impractical adjustment.

28:19.465 --> 28:22.800
And what's the point, right?

28:22.802 --> 28:24.368
Perhaps it was an experiment
designed to test

28:24.370 --> 28:27.137
my machine-based responsiveness
to human sentiments.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.907
[TABOR]
Hmm.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.909
Or an adjustment required
in order for me to respond

28:31.911 --> 28:35.279
to a complex but ultimately
irrational scenario.

28:35.981 --> 28:37.347
[THE ANDROID] Or maybe it
was a wholly impractical,

28:37.349 --> 28:41.485
completely illogical,
compassionate act of kindness.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.954
Could be...

28:43.956 --> 28:45.355
Wondering...

28:57.970 --> 28:58.902
How's it coming?

28:58.904 --> 29:00.304
Almost got it.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.510
[TABOR] You know having
the travelers in the pods

29:06.512 --> 29:08.746
is-is just a legal requirement
set up by GA convention?

29:08.748 --> 29:10.848
They don't actually have to
be in there the whole time.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.517
[THE ANDROID] True, but since we
have no way of knowing how long

29:13.519 --> 29:15.319
it will take the clones
to complete their mission,

29:15.321 --> 29:17.287
it's prudent that
they stay connected.

29:17.289 --> 29:20.090
Besides, there's no harm
in keeping them in there.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.893

Look, I'm resourceful, okay?

29:49.822 --> 29:51.421
Can you find a key
for these cuffs?

29:51.423 --> 29:54.324
We need to get back down
to the transit room.

What would you like me to do?

30:05.004 --> 30:07.037
Pick one and send the charge.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.179

to cut us loose.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.450
There's no time.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.055
See you back at the ship.

30:27.393 --> 30:28.992
Oh! They're back.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.028

How'd it go?

30:31.030 --> 30:32.996
[THREE groans]

30:32.998 --> 30:34.398
I dunno.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.235
I don't remember anything.

30:38.237 --> 30:39.536
Neither do I.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.172
That would suggest
it did not go well.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.574
Where's Five?

30:49.048 --> 30:50.447
Marauder, are you there?

[THE ANDROID] Three and Four
just returned to the ship,

30:55.131 --> 30:56.987
but they have no recollection
of their time in the facility.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.488
That must mean their clones
were terminated before they had

30:58.490 --> 31:01.091
a chance to return to the pods
and relay their memories.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.292
And what about Five?

She's still active.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.397
If you're concerned,
I can pull her out.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.532
No, let's hold off.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.434
We'll give her some more time.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.424
All right, let's just send
the charge and end this.

No.

There's no way out

She reminds me of a young me.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.435
I want her alive.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.545
Come on, kid. You can do it.

31:55.547 --> 31:56.914
She'll come back with something.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.548
Yeah, she's something else.

Yup.

Hmm. She have representation?

Drop your shields and
prepare to be boarded.

[ENEMY CAPTAIN]
That was your final warning.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.328
[THE ANDROID]
They're powering weapons again.

34:09.782 --> 34:11.265
Why aren't we firing back?

34:11.266 --> 34:12.749
[THE ANDROID] Because I've
diverted all remaining power

to the shields.

34:18.323 --> 34:20.057
I'm dropping the shields.

Wait. What?

on the enemy weapons array.

approximately 30 seconds

34:55.294 --> 34:56.443
[FIVE]
I'll be fine.

34:56.444 --> 34:57.593
My memories are
gonna be transferred

34:57.596 --> 34:59.429
back to my original body
and this clone

34:59.431 --> 35:03.166
will be broken down
and recycled.

35:03.168 --> 35:06.103
It's-It's not gonna hurt.

35:06.105 --> 35:09.239
And if it does,
I'm not gonna remember.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.640
I hope.

35:14.413 --> 35:16.613
Okay, I'm ready.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.634
Wow.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.603
I've been saying
that a lot today.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.288
So with this drive,
we could go anywhere

35:58.290 --> 36:00.190
in the galaxy in an instant?

36:00.192 --> 36:01.925
That's right.

36:01.926 --> 36:03.659
[GRIFFIN] And... we're the
only ones who have one?

36:03.662 --> 36:06.196
So it would seem,
at least for now.

36:06.198 --> 36:08.498
[GRIFFIN] This is what
we've been waiting for.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.534
It levels the playing field.

36:10.536 --> 36:12.335
If we want to take the
fight to the corporations--

36:12.337 --> 36:14.371
Uh, we never officially
had a vote on that.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.406
[GRIFFIN] We can hit them
anywhere at anytime,

36:16.408 --> 36:17.874
and they'd never see us coming.

36:17.875 --> 36:19.341
[FIVE] But aren't we getting
a little ahead of ourselves?

36:19.344 --> 36:21.211
We don't even know
if it'll work.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.212
She's right.

36:22.214 --> 36:23.713
We need to test it.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.815
How long to hook up the adapter?

36:25.817 --> 36:28.251
I'm not familiar
with this technology,

36:28.253 --> 36:30.187
but it appears that it
was designed to be compatible

36:30.189 --> 36:32.589
with standard control systems.

36:32.591 --> 36:35.859
[TWO] Well, in the meantime,
we've got one stop to make.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.902
Well, I got to admit, this has
actually been really nice.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.605
Aside from the break
and enter, the assault,

36:48.607 --> 36:50.273
threats, kidnapping,
imprisonment,

36:50.275 --> 36:51.775
I've actually had
a really great time.

36:51.777 --> 36:52.659
I'm glad.

36:52.660 --> 36:53.542
And let's keep in touch, huh?

36:53.545 --> 36:54.377
Sure.

36:54.379 --> 36:57.814
[TABOR]
So... hugs?

36:59.618 --> 37:01.218
No.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.989
All right, Android,
let's get ready to launch.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.924
[DEVON]
Hold on!

37:07.926 --> 37:10.227
Hey, uh, if
you guys don't mind,

37:10.229 --> 37:11.962
I could use a little
time off the ship.

37:11.964 --> 37:13.630
Oh, no problem.

37:13.631 --> 37:15.297
Once we've done the test,
we'll come back and pick you up.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.083
Sounds good.

37:17.084 --> 37:18.867
[NYX]
Hey! I think I'll join you.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.571
Uh, that's not necessary.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.373
I could use
some R and R myself

37:23.375 --> 37:25.008
Uh, no, really, I, uh,
I got a bunch of stuff

37:25.010 --> 37:26.509
I gotta take care of, so...

37:26.511 --> 37:28.128
[NYX]
That's fine.

37:28.129 --> 37:29.746
I'll meet you in the bar
on M level when you're done.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.382
We can continue that
conversation we were having,

37:32.384 --> 37:35.919
only this time with
chairs and glasses.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.555
Sounds good.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.892
Hey, is something wrong?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.527
I think if one of us
doesn't go with him,

37:44.529 --> 37:46.329
he's not gonna be here
when we get back.

37:46.331 --> 37:47.931
If he wants to leave the ship,
we're not gonna stop him.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.666
[NYX]
He's in a dark place right now.

37:49.668 --> 37:50.867
He's not thinking straight.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.335
[TWO]
Nyx, what are you talking about?

37:52.336 --> 37:53.802
[NYX] Look, I'm not
sitting this one out.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.538
I can help him.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.540
I know I can.

37:57.542 --> 37:58.942
Here.

38:01.546 --> 38:02.946
Okay?

38:04.983 --> 38:06.650
Android, let's go.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.929
[TWO]
Okay, this should be far enough.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.898
We're well out of visual range
of the station

38:21.899 --> 38:23.866
but still close enough in
the event anything goes wrong.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.035
What could possibly go wrong?

38:25.037 --> 38:26.770
It either works or
it doesn't, right?

38:26.772 --> 38:27.804
Are we ready?

38:27.806 --> 38:30.090
Yes.

38:30.091 --> 38:32.375
Our target destination is
160 light-years from here.

38:32.377 --> 38:34.411
Go big or stay home.

38:34.413 --> 38:35.312
[TWO]
All right.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.546
Do it.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.315
Initiating Blink Drive.

38:40.719 --> 38:45.588
[clunking and crashing]

38:45.590 --> 38:47.524
Something's wrong.

38:47.526 --> 38:48.925
Shut it down.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.661
I can't.

38:51.663 --> 39:01.838
[squealing growing louder]

39:27.833 --> 39:30.633
Your friend's late.

39:30.635 --> 39:32.035
He'll show.

39:54.459 --> 39:56.025
[HANSMEED]
Devon Teltherd.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.163
Do I know you?

40:00.165 --> 40:05.535
[HANSMEED] No, but
we know you... very well.

40:07.439 --> 40:08.672
Uh--

40:08.673 --> 40:09.906
[HANSMEED] Joined the crew of
the Raza in their escape

40:09.908 --> 40:11.674
from Hyperion-8.

40:11.676 --> 40:14.511
Arranged the sale
of four cases of Shadow

40:14.513 --> 40:18.114
to his connections
in the Al-Bali sector.

40:18.116 --> 40:23.686
Here on Regulus-12
to do the same...

40:23.688 --> 40:25.121
...as predicted.

40:28.760 --> 40:32.529
You got about half that right.

40:32.531 --> 40:35.632
Do you see any
Shadow around here?

40:37.002 --> 40:39.836
See, I'm here to make
a personal purchase.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.672
Where is the Raza?

40:42.674 --> 40:44.908
Long gone.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.476
Hangar seven.

40:46.478 --> 40:47.610
Docked under an alias.

40:47.612 --> 40:48.945
Specs should line up.

40:48.947 --> 40:49.946
I mean, check it out.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.714
They left.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.892
We want Nyx.

41:02.894 --> 41:06.179
Ahh.

41:06.180 --> 41:09.465
See, I'd love to help you
with that, but... I can't.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.100
She's one of them now.

41:15.540 --> 41:16.940
[HANSMEED]
Hmm.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.914
Where did they go?

41:24.916 --> 41:27.016
I have no idea.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.154
I can't help you
with that either.

41:33.225 --> 41:34.824
[HANSMEED sighs]

41:42.100 --> 41:45.502
[DEVOn gasps, chokes]

41:45.504 --> 41:50.573
[gasping]

41:59.584 --> 42:01.050
Back to the ship.

42:02.921 --> 42:05.722
Let's look at the next
predictive model.
