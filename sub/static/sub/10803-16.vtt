00:04.120 --> 00:08.079
Bridge Officer's log,
stardate 47611.2.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.430
Dr Beverly Crusher reporting.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.552
We have rendezvoused
with Troi's shuttlecraft.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.992
She has just returned from
a class reunion on Starbase 231.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.312
Send a message to Cmdr Data
and inform him of our delay.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.714
Aye, sir.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.474
- Deanna, welcome back.
- Thank you.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.195
I was just reporting in. I didn't
expect anyone to be up but Data.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.117
Data's away on assignment.

00:33.240 --> 00:37.313
A Federation deep-space probe went
off course and crashed on Barkon IV.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.556
Some of the material was radioactive,

00:39.680 --> 00:42.990
so Data was sent to recover it
before contamination spread.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.954
- Isn't Barkon IV inhabited?
- Yes. It's a pre-industrial society.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.277
But the probe crashed 100 kilometres
from any settlement,

00:50.400 --> 00:53.517
so Data shouldn't have any contact
with the Barkonians.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.519
- So, how was the reunion?
- Fine.

00:57.640 --> 01:01.633
It was good to see some old friends.
I'd lost touch with most of them.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.709
It's interesting to see the different
paths some of their lives have taken.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.833
Beverly, you don't usually watch the
bridge, even when Data's not here.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.030
I volunteered tonight.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.038
I like to put in a little bridge time
now and then,

01:16.160 --> 01:19.675
stay on top of operations,
technical procedures.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.150
The truth is, I like it.

01:24.040 --> 01:28.909
Not every doctor gets to command a
starship, even if it is night shift.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.911
May I ask you a personal question?

01:33.920 --> 01:36.150
Why did you decide
to become Commander?

01:36.280 --> 01:40.193
I mean, you don't need the rank in
order to be Chief Medical Officer.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.993
So, why put yourself through
all the extra work?

01:43.120 --> 01:44.235
I don't know.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.237
I never used to think about rank.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.158
It seemed trivial
compared to being a doctor.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.953
But then, about eight years ago,

01:52.080 --> 01:55.868
I started to feel like I wanted
to stretch myself a little.

01:57.320 --> 02:00.471
Commander, there's no response
from Cmdr Data.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.800
Continue sending him updates
on our schedule.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.275
- Aye, sir.
- Is something wrong?

02:06.400 --> 02:10.757
No. I wanted to tell Data there's
a few days' delay in picking him up.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.919
We have orders to take some medical
supplies to the Taranko colony.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.393
But he's not responding?

02:16.520 --> 02:20.638
Geordi said the probe's radiation
might interfere with communications.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.751
I just thought I'd try anyway.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.709
So when you return from school,
I'll be with the village elders.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.070
- Again?
- Gia.

02:31.200 --> 02:34.829
I know, you're the town magistrate
and you have a lot of work to do,

02:34.960 --> 02:38.032
but it seems
you're always in some meeting or...

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.440 --> 03:20.830
Space, the final frontier.

03:22.080 --> 03:25.914
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.953
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

03:31.320 --> 03:34.471
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

03:35.720 --> 03:39.918
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.671
Gia, go home. Now!

04:42.960 --> 04:43.710
Who are you?

04:44.360 --> 04:46.078
What do you want?

04:46.200 --> 04:52.355
Who are you? Wha...

04:53.560 --> 04:57.030
What do you want?

04:57.640 --> 04:58.868
What's wrong with you?

05:01.560 --> 05:06.350
What's wrong with you?

05:07.040 --> 05:11.272
There's nothing wrong with me.
Who are you?

05:12.240 --> 05:14.196
What is your name?

05:15.680 --> 05:17.511
Can you understand me?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.680
My name is Garvin.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.078
My name...

05:28.800 --> 05:30.711
...is Garvin.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.678
I thought I told you to go home.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.553
I know.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.154
I...

05:43.240 --> 05:45.470
...do not know my name.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.789
What?

05:47.920 --> 05:52.471
You asked if I knew my name.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.879
I do not.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.878
At least you seem
to be understanding a little more.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.399
Yes.

06:01.720 --> 06:05.349
It is becoming easier.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.914
Ask him where he's from, Father.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.157
Gia, go on to school.
I'll deal with the stranger.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.077
Yes, Father.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.596
Goodbye.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.352
Goodbye.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.639
Your eyes and skin look so strange.

06:28.920 --> 06:33.391
Your clothes, you look like you've
been in some kind of accident.

06:37.920 --> 06:42.550
I do not remember
being in an accident.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.588
What do you remember?

06:47.360 --> 06:50.955
I walked here. From the mountains.

06:51.080 --> 06:56.074
The mountains? The mountains
are over 200 seltons from here.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.197
I have a clear memory
of my journey.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.391
What do you remember before that?

07:07.040 --> 07:09.508
I have no prior memory.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.753
Do you know what that is?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.399
No.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.269
May I?

07:22.920 --> 07:25.036
- May I have it?
- Yes.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.989
There might be something in here
that can tell us who you are.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.350
I wonder what these markings mean.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.232
- Radioactive.
- What?

07:38.880 --> 07:42.668
- It is written on the container.
- You can read this language?

07:44.160 --> 07:45.434
Evidently.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.234
Radioactive. What does that mean?

07:50.920 --> 07:52.399
I do not know.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.438
Perhaps it is my name.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.358
I never heard a name like that.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.597
You must come from
a very distant place.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.394
Is that supposed to be a question?

08:43.520 --> 08:46.478
Because if you're asking me
if I like it, then yes.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.599
This is a better way
of communicating for you.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.154
It's less confusing
than the way you speak.

08:56.320 --> 09:00.472
I knew I could count on the ship's
Counsellor to boost my self-image!

09:00.600 --> 09:01.999
I'm glad to be of service.

09:02.120 --> 09:05.669
Did you want something,
or just general Riker-bashing?

09:05.800 --> 09:08.951
I wanted to ask your opinion
about something.

09:09.080 --> 09:13.392
I'm thinking of taking the bridge
officer's test, becoming a commander.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.794
What brought this up?

09:14.920 --> 09:18.879
A lot of things. Working on
the personnel review last month,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.833
talking to Beverly
about her experiences,

09:21.960 --> 09:24.315
going to my class reunion.

09:24.440 --> 09:29.468
The class reunion. You saw a few
old friends who had taken the test?

09:29.600 --> 09:32.239
Alright, I admit it was a catalyst.

09:32.360 --> 09:37.115
But I've been thinking about this
off and on for the past two years.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.195
Why two years?

09:38.320 --> 09:40.914
Remember
when we hit that quantum filament

09:41.040 --> 09:42.917
and I was in command on the bridge?

09:43.040 --> 09:43.950
I do.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.435
When that happened,
I was overwhelmed.

09:46.560 --> 09:50.599
But when it was over, I realised
that a part of me missed it.

09:50.720 --> 09:56.477
Not the actual disaster, but
the experience of being in command.

09:56.600 --> 10:00.559
I felt like I was exploring
a whole new side of myself.

10:00.680 --> 10:05.913
I don't want to give up counselling,
but just stretch myself a little.

10:06.040 --> 10:11.273
Deanna, if you take
the bridge officer's test,

10:11.400 --> 10:13.038
you'll have my full support.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.990
But as First Officer, I'll be the one
judging you, and I'm a tough judge.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.315
And I'm a good student.

10:23.480 --> 10:27.075
We'll start tomorrow morning.
0800 hours.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.677
Remarkable set of teeth.

10:31.800 --> 10:36.157
Breath smells like...
It doesn't have any smell actually.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.998
You can close your mouth.

10:38.760 --> 10:43.436
Let's see. Heartbeat sounds
a little odd, but seems very regular.

10:45.680 --> 10:49.958
Skin feels... clammy,
but you say you feel fine?

10:50.480 --> 10:51.549
That is correct.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.877
Headaches, palpitations,
sluggishness, indigestion?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.390
No. But I cannot have indigestion
since I have not eaten.

10:59.440 --> 11:03.353
Malnutrition. You should eat
something to build your strength

11:03.480 --> 11:07.758
and return your vitality. Lots of
meat, butter, cheese for a start.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.838
What about his eyes and his skin?
They're so odd.

11:10.960 --> 11:14.714
Quite so. My grandmother would have
called our friend a demon

11:14.840 --> 11:17.115
or a spirit or some sort of monster.

11:17.240 --> 11:21.597
But current scientific methodology
allows us to dismiss superstitions

11:21.720 --> 11:25.076
and concentrate
on scientific reality.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.432
- Then what do you believe I am?
- You are an ice man.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.394
Ice man?

11:31.520 --> 11:33.556
Yes. You probably come from a race

11:33.680 --> 11:36.911
who lived in the ice
of the Vellorian mountains.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.031
Your skin and eye colour

11:39.160 --> 11:43.358
are a result of prolonged exposure
to harsh winter conditions.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.799
Then I am not ill?

11:44.920 --> 11:46.592
Aside from your memory loss,

11:46.720 --> 11:50.759
you do not seem to have symptoms
of any illness I am familiar with.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.838
No. You are an ice man.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.952
Now, get something to eat
and a good night's rest,

11:57.080 --> 12:01.596
and I'll come back tomorrow and see
if your memory has begun to return.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.153
Thank you.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.710
- Hello, Gia.
- Hello.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.953
What did Talar say about him?
Is he sick?

12:15.320 --> 12:19.791
Not exactly. She said he's lost
his memory but seems fine otherwise.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.798
Talar thinks he's from a race
in the mountains.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.911
I am an ice man.

12:25.480 --> 12:29.155
We'll have to call you something else
until your memory returns.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.629
What was the word on the container?

12:32.760 --> 12:34.193
Radioactive.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.639
Mr Radioactive.

12:37.680 --> 12:42.470
I don't like that name.
Let's call him... Jayden.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.396
What do you think of that?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.992
Jayden. That is acceptable.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.638
Now, we need to clean him
and get him something to wear.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.228
Run upstairs
and get some of my old clothes.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.237
Yes, Father.

12:58.640 --> 13:02.952
I wonder if Skoran can tell us
something about this metal of yours.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.356
You, ice man!
Where'd you find this?

13:13.480 --> 13:16.552
- I do not know.
- I told you, he's lost his memory.

13:16.680 --> 13:20.514
- We're calling him Jayden for now.
- Jayden, huh?

13:20.640 --> 13:24.553
- The metal is slightly warm.
- All the fragments are like that.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.709
It's obviously been tempered
and milled.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.308
The lustrous quality of the metal
is so pure.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.193
This wasn't made in any forge
that I've ever seen.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.550
- Will you sell them?
- Do you want them?

13:40.680 --> 13:43.194
It's malleable enough
to make jewellery.

13:43.320 --> 13:48.110
They belong to Jayden. Do you want
to sell them? You will need money.

13:48.240 --> 13:52.313
You may be right. But I do not wish
to sell all the fragments.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.318
They may provide
a clue to my identity.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.635
I'll give you 20 doraks
for half the lot.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.799
Agreed.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.068
My leg! Get it off!

14:10.200 --> 14:13.317
- Get it off!
- We need a lever!

14:14.560 --> 14:17.393
It'll be alright. Don't struggle.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.992
Jayden. Put it down.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.110
I believe the support structure
on the anvil collapsed

14:52.240 --> 14:54.470
because some of the wood had rotted.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.635
Did I do something wrong, Garvin?

15:09.240 --> 15:12.471
No. Just unexpected.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.951
It's perfectly understandable.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.640
Your people probably all
have great strength,

15:19.760 --> 15:25.118
to fight off the ferocious creatures
that live in the Vellorian mountains.

15:25.240 --> 15:29.597
You told me that no one from the
village has been to the mountains.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.757
How do you know
there are ferocious creatures there?

15:32.880 --> 15:34.233
It's a well-known fact.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.792
But no one has actually seen one?

15:37.360 --> 15:39.430
Well, not to my knowledge, but...

15:41.160 --> 15:42.752
Father, are you alright?

15:44.360 --> 15:48.512
I've been tired since this afternoon.
I'm sure it's nothing.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.319
You feel slightly warm. Fresh air
and a brisk walk will do you good.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.079
That sounds like a good idea.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.990
I'll be back soon.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.913
You didn't like it?

16:21.560 --> 16:25.155
I neither liked it nor disliked it.
I simply had no appetite.

16:26.520 --> 16:31.036
Father's cooking isn't as good
as Mother's. He tries, though.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.949
Where is your mother?

16:35.240 --> 16:39.438
She died about a year ago.
Father said she...

16:40.840 --> 16:43.149
...she went to a beautiful place...

16:44.360 --> 16:48.558
...where everything is peaceful
and everyone loves each other...

16:50.000 --> 16:52.355
...and no one ever gets sick.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.550
Do you think
there is a place like that?

17:02.680 --> 17:04.352
Yes.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.071
I do.

17:17.280 --> 17:21.319
We lost contact with everything
above deck 21, including the bridge.

17:21.440 --> 17:26.230
There's something wrong with one
of the antimatter-containment units.

17:26.359 --> 17:31.070
- Switch to auxiliary control.
- Auxiliary control is not on line.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.829
We are losing containment
on the antimatter unit three.

17:34.960 --> 17:35.995
Alright.

17:37.760 --> 17:42.356
Switch the EM power inverter
to the lateral... No, wait!

17:44.480 --> 17:45.708
Use the neodyne relay.

17:45.840 --> 17:50.072
Commander, the relay isn't holding.
Containment failure in ten seconds.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.077
Computer, emergency procedure.

17:52.200 --> 17:56.079
Eject antimatter unit three.
Authorisation Troi Omega Omega 31.

17:56.200 --> 18:00.990
Unable to comply. Power to
ejection systems has been terminated.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.633
Commander, the unit's...

18:05.760 --> 18:09.275
Congratulations.
You just destroyed the Enterprise.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.233
- Thank you for the encouragement!
- Don't feel bad.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.475
You passed the rest,

18:13.600 --> 18:17.149
diplomatic law, first contact
procedure, bridge operations.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.874
Engineering's
the toughest part of the test.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.959
- So, what did I do wrong?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.957
Why not? What kind of test is this?

18:26.080 --> 18:30.232
The kind you have to take again
if you want to be a bridge officer!

18:30.360 --> 18:33.272
Only next time,
the problem won't be so easy.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.832
So I suggest you study
your emergency procedures.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.838
How can I, if you won't tell me
what I did wrong?

18:40.400 --> 18:41.389
I don't know.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.592
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that either.

18:49.480 --> 18:53.758
Rock, fire, sky and water are
the basic elements of the universe.

18:53.880 --> 18:58.635
They can be found in every object,
animal, person, everything.

18:58.760 --> 19:02.036
The rock in this wood can be felt
by its weight and hardness.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.912
If we expose the wood to flame,

19:04.040 --> 19:08.397
we can encourage the fire
within the wood to show itself.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.273
We can also see smoke...

19:12.800 --> 19:14.836
...which is a part of the sky.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.438
The water in wood
is difficult to see.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.632
Sometimes the elements
are buried deep within objects,

19:21.760 --> 19:25.514
but the four elements
are always there.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.354
Yes, Jayden?

19:30.960 --> 19:32.757
I do not believe that is correct.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.438
Oh?

19:34.560 --> 19:37.279
I believe you are reasoning
by analogy,

19:37.400 --> 19:41.712
classifying things according
to superficial observation

19:41.840 --> 19:43.831
rather than empirical evidence.

19:43.960 --> 19:48.192
Wood, for example, does not contain
fire because it is combustible,

19:48.320 --> 19:51.039
nor does it contain rock
because it is heavy.

19:51.160 --> 19:54.197
Wood, like any complex organic form,

19:54.320 --> 19:59.110
is composed of thousands of chemical
compounds, none of which is fire.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.117
That will be enough, Jayden.

20:01.240 --> 20:04.710
As I told you, our friend Jayden
has lost much of his memory,

20:04.840 --> 20:08.799
so I wouldn't put too much faith
in any of his ideas.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.514
That is all for today.
I will see you tomorrow.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.791
Practise your spelling
and arithmetic tonight.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.358
Are you alright?

20:28.480 --> 20:32.234
Yes. But I do not agree
with Talar's assessment.

20:32.360 --> 20:36.592
Although I do have gaps
in my memory,

20:36.720 --> 20:38.790
I know that fire is not an element.

20:38.920 --> 20:42.310
That is not what you promised me!

20:42.440 --> 20:47.195
You're getting old. I offered you 15
for the metal and I gave it to you.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.799
We agreed on 20.

20:48.920 --> 20:51.639
Garvin is correct. You agreed on 20.

20:51.760 --> 20:55.275
Stay out of this, ice man!
Your memory is not reliable.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.595
Father! Father, what's wrong?

20:57.720 --> 21:01.872
I don't know.
I feel very weak suddenly.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.197
You have a fever.
We should get him home.

21:11.440 --> 21:15.194
- What's wrong with him?
- I suspect he...

21:19.080 --> 21:24.871
I don't know. I've never encountered
anything like this before.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.553
These lesions look like burn marks.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.200
The fluids of his body
have overheated.

21:37.320 --> 21:40.357
That would explain
the fever and burning skin.

21:40.480 --> 21:43.552
Keep him cool, let plenty
of fresh air into the house,

21:43.680 --> 21:46.148
and I want you to give him
these herbs.

21:46.280 --> 21:49.158
That will bring his
fluidic temperature down

21:49.280 --> 21:51.714
and allow this to pass.

21:51.840 --> 21:52.590
I understand.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.911
With an increased focal length

21:56.040 --> 21:58.031
and an achromatic objective lens,

21:58.160 --> 22:01.948
this instrument will have
a higher effective magnification.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.874
I will come back tomorrow
and check on you.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.718
Thank you.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.799
Garvin, with your permission,

22:13.920 --> 22:18.357
I would like to begin my own
investigation into your illness.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.674
Go ahead.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.433
Gia, would you accompany me
to the village?

22:23.560 --> 22:25.551
I will need some supplies.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.989
What are you going to do
with all this?

22:37.120 --> 22:41.511
Make the laboratory equipment
to research your father's illness.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.757
- Do you think you can help him?
- I do not know.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.314
I must isolate the cause
of the illness...

22:47.440 --> 22:48.475
There he is!

22:48.600 --> 22:52.115
It's his fault! No one was sick
before he came to the village.

22:56.560 --> 23:00.633
- Has Garvin's illness spread?
- That's right. And you're the cause.

23:00.760 --> 23:05.311
- That's not true!
- Gia, I think we should leave.

23:05.440 --> 23:10.912
That's it. Leave. Get out of here.
Go back to where you came from!

23:24.360 --> 23:26.396
Jayden, what are you doing?

23:26.520 --> 23:29.432
I'm studying skin samples
from Gia and Garvin

23:29.560 --> 23:32.996
in an attempt to isolate
the cause of the illness.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.473
Gia?

23:34.600 --> 23:37.910
Yes. She is also beginning
to show signs of the illness.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.473
What is that?

23:41.600 --> 23:45.912
It is a magnifying device
based on your handheld instrument.

23:46.040 --> 23:49.237
I have refined the design
to increase magnification.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.833
- May I?
- Of course.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.675
How strong is the magnification?

23:59.800 --> 24:04.510
Objects appear approximately
500 times their normal size.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.996
As you can see, the cellular damage
is quite extensive.

24:08.120 --> 24:12.318
Based on interstitial transparency
and membrane integrity,

24:12.440 --> 24:17.309
I do not believe it is an infection
or a communicable disease.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.714
I see.

24:18.840 --> 24:23.197
At the moment, I am looking
for a common event or experience

24:23.320 --> 24:26.790
that Gia, Garvin and Skoran
may have shared

24:26.920 --> 24:30.799
that could have a causal
relationship to their illness.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.754
They've lived here many years
and have many common experiences.

24:34.880 --> 24:39.396
Yes. But since the illness struck
all three in a short period of time,

24:39.520 --> 24:43.638
we must assume the experience
is recent and unusual.

24:43.760 --> 24:46.035
Actually, Jayden, encountering you

24:46.160 --> 24:50.039
has been the most unusual experience
they've shared recently.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.594
I am aware of that. Excuse me.

24:52.720 --> 24:57.555
I am also open to the possibility
that I may be the causal factor.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.353
However, since you have had much
contact with me

25:00.480 --> 25:04.553
and show no sign of sickness,
I tend to discount myself.

25:04.680 --> 25:07.240
Still, it has to be more
than just a coincidence

25:07.360 --> 25:11.512
that shortly after you arrived,
people started to become ill.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.392
I agree.

25:16.240 --> 25:21.997
Jayden, I tried to give Father
his broth, but he won't eat.

25:22.120 --> 25:25.032
You have a fever.
You should be in bed.

25:25.160 --> 25:28.391
No, I'm alright. Father needs me.

25:28.520 --> 25:33.275
Talar is correct. You should rest.
I will attend to your father.

25:33.960 --> 25:37.157
Gia, when did you begin
wearing that pendant?

25:39.440 --> 25:42.876
Two days ago.
Father bought it from Skoran. Why?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.911
May I see it?

25:52.160 --> 25:56.119
This is one of the metal fragments
I sold to Skoran.

26:09.240 --> 26:12.391
The secondary plasma vent...

26:14.280 --> 26:18.034
...has a triple redundant bypass.

26:19.920 --> 26:23.833
Which means
that the primary access junction...

26:24.960 --> 26:27.838
...is routed through...

26:27.960 --> 26:29.075
Come in.

26:30.040 --> 26:35.512
...would be routed through
the port transducer matrix.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.070
Come to give me more
encouragement?

26:39.200 --> 26:44.149
No. I'm here to tell you that
I've decided to cancel your test.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.156
What?!

26:45.280 --> 26:48.397
- I'm cancelling the test.
- May I ask why?

26:48.520 --> 26:52.433
You've taken engineering three times.
You're no closer to passing.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.279
Then I'll take it four times.
Or 14 times.

26:55.400 --> 26:58.915
Or however many times it's necessary
for me to get it right!

27:00.000 --> 27:03.709
Deanna... this is nothing personal.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.513
Not everyone
is cut out to be a bridge officer.

27:06.640 --> 27:09.074
- I don't think this is for you.
- Why?

27:09.200 --> 27:13.079
Because I'm not the most technically
minded person on the ship?

27:13.200 --> 27:17.398
I may have trouble telling a plasma
conduit from a phase inducer,

27:17.520 --> 27:21.399
but there's more to being a bridge
officer than memorising manuals.

27:21.520 --> 27:25.957
There is. You could memorise
all the manuals in the computer.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.150
I still don't think you'd pass.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.999
Tell me one thing,
is there a solution?

27:31.120 --> 27:35.272
Or is this simply a test of my
ability to handle a no-win situation?

27:36.600 --> 27:39.876
- There is a solution.
- Then give me time to find it.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.513
I can't.

27:42.400 --> 27:46.598
As much as I care about you,
my first duty is to the ship.

27:47.640 --> 27:51.474
I cannot let any bridge officer
serve who's not qualified. I'm sorry.

28:17.120 --> 28:21.318
"My first duty is to the ship."

28:23.920 --> 28:25.751
The ship!

28:27.480 --> 28:31.871
Computer, load bridge officer's test,
engineering qualification.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.671
- Computer ready.
- Run program.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.156
The primary containment
control system is not functioning.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.716
The conduit to the antimatter
storage deck is severed.

28:41.840 --> 28:42.795
Geordi...

28:44.240 --> 28:47.789
...could you repair the conduit
if you went into the crawlspace?

28:49.560 --> 28:52.757
Sir, that crawlway
is in a warp-plasma shaft.

28:52.880 --> 28:56.839
- He would not survive the radiation.
- I know that.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.919
Geordi, could you
repair the conduit?

29:02.080 --> 29:03.991
Yeah. I think I could.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.713
Then do it. That's an order.

29:22.080 --> 29:23.229
End simulation.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.710
Something told me
you wouldn't let this go.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.752
Congratulations. You passed.

29:34.880 --> 29:38.714
That's what this was about, to see
if I'd order someone to their death.

29:38.840 --> 29:40.478
That's right.

29:40.600 --> 29:44.115
That was part of being in command
I thought I'd prepared for.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.198
But when the moment came,
I hesitated.

29:47.320 --> 29:50.232
Maybe you were right,
maybe I'm not cut out for this.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.595
You did exactly what you had to do.

29:53.720 --> 29:58.555
You considered all your options
and then you made the hard choice.

29:59.480 --> 30:00.674
Come on.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.833
Let's get out of here, Commander.

30:07.360 --> 30:11.751
I have coated this piece of cloth
with the liquid used in lamps.

30:16.440 --> 30:21.036
The cloth becomes luminescent when
it is exposed to an energy source.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.798
This pendant also
appears to be an energy source.

30:28.920 --> 30:32.833
But... where is this
pattern of light coming from?

30:32.960 --> 30:37.272
I believe a stream of particles is
emanating from the metallic pendant

30:37.400 --> 30:38.628
and hitting the cloth.

30:38.760 --> 30:41.718
I don't see particles
coming from the pendant.

30:43.760 --> 30:47.275
You will see there are.
I can even block them.

30:47.400 --> 30:51.712
It would appear that this container
was constructed of a material

30:51.840 --> 30:55.310
which blocks the particles
coming from the metal.

30:55.440 --> 30:59.797
- It's a trick.
- No. It is empirical data.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.432
I believe the fragments
were placed in this container

31:03.560 --> 31:06.791
to protect people
from accidental exposure.

31:06.920 --> 31:11.038
The word "radioactive" may be a
warning about the dangerous metal.

31:12.240 --> 31:15.152
Alright. Let's say
for the moment you are right,

31:15.280 --> 31:19.671
that there are particles coming
from the metal. What should we do?

31:20.400 --> 31:22.960
I will continue my experiment.

31:23.080 --> 31:26.834
I want you to gather all the pieces
of metal in the village

31:26.960 --> 31:29.030
and place them in this container.

31:29.160 --> 31:33.199
Alright. But when I return, I want
a thorough explanation of all this.

31:33.320 --> 31:36.198
And I want to examine your data,
in detail.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.276
Of course.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.839
There you are!
You're the cause of this, ice man!

32:06.960 --> 32:09.997
If you refer to the illness,
you are partially correct.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.031
But it is more complex than that.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.718
The metal fragment...

32:19.000 --> 32:21.195
What... what are you?

32:33.200 --> 32:35.111
I do not know.

32:42.720 --> 32:46.474
I saw it with my own eyes.
He's some kind of creature.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.955
It's not true, Father.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.550
We must fight him.
And stop him before he kills us all.

32:52.680 --> 32:58.152
I don't... Not Jayden.
He wouldn't try to hurt us.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.069
Come on!

33:08.080 --> 33:10.958
Let him rest for now.
You should rest as well.

33:11.080 --> 33:14.834
Exerting yourself
will only make you sicker.

33:15.600 --> 33:16.919
I'll be back.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.473
Gia.

33:44.240 --> 33:45.719
Jayden!

33:45.840 --> 33:48.070
Everyone's looking for you.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.237
Skoran said...
you're some kind of... creature.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.951
I do not know... what I am.

33:57.280 --> 33:58.713
But I am not like you.

33:59.360 --> 34:03.751
I know. You are an ice man.
We talked about that.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.158
No.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.359
I am not.

34:11.120 --> 34:14.715
Jayden,
why are you wearing that hood?

34:15.719 --> 34:17.277
I do not wish to frighten you.

34:18.120 --> 34:22.636
I won't be afraid. Take it off.
Please. I have to see.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.471
I understand your reaction.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.710
But I do not wish to harm you.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.194
You or Garvin or anyone else.

34:44.320 --> 34:48.199
I only wish to help,
to find a cure for the illness.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.629
I was very close.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.911
I must continue my work,
but it will take time.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.718
How long until Skoran
and the others return?

34:59.320 --> 35:02.835
I don't know.
They're looking for you now.

35:02.960 --> 35:05.076
Then I must hurry.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.272
Gia...

35:27.200 --> 35:29.236
I believe I have found the answer.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.550
You think you've found a cure?

35:32.680 --> 35:34.272
I believe so.

35:34.960 --> 35:38.475
I tested this medicine
on skin samples from your father.

35:38.600 --> 35:42.070
They showed improvement,
so I administered this to him.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.714
He is now recovering.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.269
What kind of medicine is it?

35:49.400 --> 35:54.520
A compound which will neutralise the
particles that are making you ill.

35:55.720 --> 35:56.709
Swallow this.

35:59.960 --> 36:03.316
I must administer this
to everyone in the village,

36:03.440 --> 36:06.398
but they do not trust me
after what happened to Skoran.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.909
I could tell them.

36:09.040 --> 36:12.794
I am afraid
they will not believe you, either.

36:14.600 --> 36:19.549
Is the well in the town square the
only source of water in the town?

36:20.200 --> 36:23.272
- Well?
- This is very important.

36:23.400 --> 36:27.359
Are there any sources
of fresh water near the village?

36:29.600 --> 36:32.797
No. The nearest river...

36:33.880 --> 36:35.359
...is two days away.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.551
Then I will put this compound
into the well water.

36:39.680 --> 36:44.276
It may be diluted, but it should
still have enough potency to work.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.072
Compound...

37:33.360 --> 37:34.918
There he is!

37:38.640 --> 37:41.712
You see? It's just as I said.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.353
I only wish to help.

37:43.480 --> 37:47.155
This is how you helped us,
by bringing this plague?

37:47.640 --> 37:49.835
Trying to kill us all?

37:49.960 --> 37:54.158
Well, you won't succeed!
I won't let you!

38:53.720 --> 38:56.996
Excuse me.
We're looking for a friend of ours.

38:57.120 --> 39:00.351
He might have wandered
into your village a few days ago.

39:00.480 --> 39:03.438
You'd remember him.
He would have seemed strange.

39:03.560 --> 39:04.959
Pale skin, gold eyes.

39:05.080 --> 39:08.038
- He was your friend?
- Yes, do you know him?

39:10.720 --> 39:11.994
Where is he?

39:19.600 --> 39:21.238
I don't understand.

39:21.360 --> 39:25.114
We didn't know his real name,
so we called him Jayden.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.719
He's dead?

39:28.560 --> 39:31.358
They killed him because
they were afraid of him,

39:31.480 --> 39:33.516
but he saved us from sickness.

39:33.640 --> 39:34.959
The sickness?

39:36.560 --> 39:40.838
There were these pieces of metal.
They made everyone sick.

39:41.920 --> 39:45.629
But Jayden put something in the water
and now everyone's better.

39:45.760 --> 39:50.072
- What happened to the metal?
- We buried them in the forest.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.672
What was his real name?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.194
Data.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.432
Data.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.235
He was my friend, too.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.595
It's Data, alright.
He's buried about two metres down.

40:27.720 --> 40:31.076
He's been deactivated
so I can't assess the damage.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.556
We could beam him and
the probe fragments onto the ship.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.557
No one would know.

40:41.440 --> 40:45.115
Positronic net on line.
Subprocessor relays in place.

40:45.240 --> 40:48.152
Neuroelectrical systems enabled.

40:53.560 --> 40:56.279
Data! Are you alright?

40:56.400 --> 40:57.799
I do not know.

40:59.200 --> 41:03.751
I am surprised to find myself here.
I thought I was on Barkon IV.

41:04.360 --> 41:07.193
What's the last thing
you remember?

41:07.320 --> 41:09.880
I had located the crashed
Federation probe

41:10.000 --> 41:13.834
and collected
the radioactive fragments,

41:13.960 --> 41:18.590
I was attempting to download the
sensor logs from the probe computer.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.597
There was a power surge.

41:21.760 --> 41:25.594
I believe the surge
overloaded my positronic matrix.

41:25.720 --> 41:30.510
After that, I have no memory
until this moment.

41:34.240 --> 41:37.391
It appears
I had an interesting time.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.351
We don't know much either.

41:39.480 --> 41:43.155
Apparently, you saved an entire
village from radiation poisoning.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.919
And were a very special friend
to a little girl.

41:50.560 --> 41:55.315
Well, if you'll excuse me,

41:55.440 --> 41:57.590
I have the bridge this watch.

41:57.720 --> 42:01.599
Counsellor, have you been promoted
in my absence?

42:01.720 --> 42:05.508
That's right. Which means
from now on you can call me "sir."

42:06.880 --> 42:08.154
Yes, sir.
