WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:01.972
<i>My gosh. Did she teach you how to
make this? Previously on sleepy hollow...</i>

00:01.980 --> 00:03.180
Hey.

00:03.210 --> 00:05.010
Move and I will
blow you to hell.

00:05.050 --> 00:06.780
Crane!

00:06.820 --> 00:09.050
I thought bullets didn't work
on the horseman.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.420
He's vulnerable on the stone.

00:10.450 --> 00:11.543
My Tinder date was telling me

00:11.550 --> 00:12.643
about this video
that he watched.

00:12.650 --> 00:16.260
<i>It was posted on Logan MacDonald's
picagram feed.</i>

00:16.290 --> 00:18.120
<i>Somebody hacked his account
and then embedded</i>

00:18.160 --> 00:20.890
the pamphlet's curse
into the video's source code.

00:20.930 --> 00:21.900
Has to be Dreyfuss.

00:21.930 --> 00:23.160
He summoned this creature

00:23.200 --> 00:26.170
<i>and ravaged our noble city
with its pestilence. Why?</i>

00:26.200 --> 00:28.500
I am assembling a team

00:28.540 --> 00:29.770
of my own.

00:29.810 --> 00:31.400
A hero's welcome

00:31.440 --> 00:32.870
to the man of the hour!

00:32.910 --> 00:36.580
Sent the picagram
heard round the world.

00:36.610 --> 00:39.510
I've come to believe
I don't need any of you anymore.

00:39.550 --> 00:43.250
The second recruit is...
Ready to be plucked soon.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.510 --> 01:09.080
Helen! Welcome.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.980
Not a moment too soon.
Come in, come in.

01:12.010 --> 01:14.510
So...

01:14.550 --> 01:16.850
This is where you've been
hiding yourself, Malcolm.

01:16.890 --> 01:18.250
Well, not...

01:18.290 --> 01:20.850
Hiding, so much as working.

01:20.890 --> 01:23.760
May I offer you tea,
coffee, water?

01:23.790 --> 01:25.790
I didn't get up
at the crack of dawn

01:25.830 --> 01:29.300
and fly 400 miles
for a latte, Malcolm.

01:29.330 --> 01:30.760
You shuttered the company

01:30.800 --> 01:32.100
to do what?

01:32.130 --> 01:33.900
Pursue a career
in the fine arts?

01:33.940 --> 01:36.470
Hey, no one has
heard from you in weeks.

01:36.510 --> 01:38.410
And it's all over the news.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.940
The scuttlebutt is that
you have lost it.

01:41.980 --> 01:43.410
You are awfully close, Helen.

01:43.450 --> 01:46.680
But it's...
It's not quite madness.

01:48.380 --> 01:50.950
It's clarity.

01:50.990 --> 01:53.450
See, the truth is,

01:53.490 --> 01:57.190
I just have more important
concerns right now.

01:57.230 --> 01:59.390
So what is this?

01:59.430 --> 02:02.130
Some kind of one-man think tank?

02:02.160 --> 02:04.330
You planning
the next big rollout?

02:04.370 --> 02:06.130
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

02:06.170 --> 02:10.900
I invited you here
because... I have been...

02:10.940 --> 02:14.570
Impressed with your work
as CFO at Dreyfuss,

02:14.610 --> 02:17.140
and I would be honored
if you would consider

02:17.180 --> 02:21.010
taking an exciting new role
in the next iteration.

02:21.050 --> 02:23.080
See, I need hosts, Helen.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.850
Hosts, like... for an event?

02:25.890 --> 02:29.160
Yes. But probably not
exactly the way you think.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.560
See, Helen,
I've always appreciated you.

02:31.590 --> 02:34.330
And we all know you're
an exceptionally strong woman.

02:34.360 --> 02:39.500
And your hunger for power...

02:39.530 --> 02:41.070
Good heavens.

02:41.100 --> 02:44.340
It's like
you're famished for it.

02:44.370 --> 02:47.670
You are gonna do so well
in this position.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.810
I can sign an NDA
if you'd like to tell me more.

02:50.850 --> 02:53.210
Not at all necessary, my dear.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.850
Jobe!

02:54.880 --> 02:56.150
Please.

02:56.180 --> 02:57.520
Our friend Helen

02:57.550 --> 03:00.550
is interested in the position
we are offering.

03:04.030 --> 03:06.630
No!

03:08.660 --> 03:10.100
Hello.

03:10.130 --> 03:11.430
Ichabod!

03:11.470 --> 03:12.570
Groovy party.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.470
Thank you, Barbara.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.270
This must be your... Beau.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.570
Zappa.

03:17.610 --> 03:18.940
But call me zaps.

03:18.970 --> 03:20.970
Or zap.

03:21.010 --> 03:24.880
Well, 'tis a pleasure,
zap... zip-zap... zap-zap.

03:24.910 --> 03:27.480
A match made in Aquarius.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.250
Excuse me.

03:30.290 --> 03:32.090
Hey.

03:37.430 --> 03:39.690
Who invited the guy
dressed like Hamilton?

03:39.730 --> 03:41.430
Sham-ilton.

03:41.460 --> 03:43.130
My thoughts exactly.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.630
It's a pretty good turnout,
crane.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.100
When master Jake suggested

03:49.140 --> 03:51.910
I invite a few neighbors
over for a party,

03:51.940 --> 03:54.270
I... didn't expect
so many to attend.

03:54.310 --> 03:56.110
Crane.

03:56.140 --> 03:57.740
These people really dig you.

03:57.780 --> 04:00.610
You know, in your whole time
in sleepy hollow,

04:00.650 --> 04:03.780
you never threw
a party like this.

04:03.820 --> 04:07.750
Maybe things are working out
for you here in D.C.

04:09.660 --> 04:13.290
Yeah, I'd... not thought
about it like that.

04:13.330 --> 04:14.830
And you're right, miss Jenny.

04:16.470 --> 04:18.970
I'm satisfied with
my work in the vault.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.930
The team is doing
particularly well.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.640
And now I have a place
to lay my head.

04:25.070 --> 04:28.840
Perhaps D.C. is shaping up
to be home.

04:30.850 --> 04:32.580
And what about you?

04:32.610 --> 04:34.650
Will you be
putting down roots here?

04:34.680 --> 04:37.880
No, D.C. is fine,
but I came here

04:37.920 --> 04:40.390
to find and train
the next witness,

04:40.420 --> 04:43.560
and that's what I'm doing
and... after that,

04:43.590 --> 04:45.790
who knows?

04:45.830 --> 04:47.360
Back to sleepy hollow, perhaps?

04:47.400 --> 04:48.530
No.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.223
Settling down there
was kind of an anomaly.

04:50.230 --> 04:53.500
I'm really a lot more
comfortable on the move.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.700
Well, there art rooms
down the hall

04:55.740 --> 04:57.500
that will be available
for next month.

04:59.670 --> 05:01.210
Options.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.680
Thanks.

05:05.710 --> 05:07.980
I'm just, really not the...

05:08.020 --> 05:09.850
Housewarming type.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.120
I hope crane won't mind
that I have to split early.

05:15.160 --> 05:18.390
<i>They're showing Onibaba, this,
like, classic '60s horror flick</i>

05:18.430 --> 05:20.190
at the Avalon this afternoon.

05:20.230 --> 05:23.000
Hasn't fighting real monsters
put you off that sort of thing?

05:23.030 --> 05:25.930
It's a brand-new
35-millimeter print

05:25.970 --> 05:27.470
struck from the
original negative.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.600
And since, when did
book nerd become film geek?

05:30.640 --> 05:32.203
Missy is totally
into horror flicks, man.

05:32.210 --> 05:34.010
It's, like, her thing.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.340
Hey... there she is.

05:35.380 --> 05:36.680
Missy!

05:37.980 --> 05:39.510
Hey.

05:39.550 --> 05:40.550
How's it going?

05:41.580 --> 05:43.450
You have to be Alex.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.890
So good to meet you.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.620
If you're half as
cool as Jake says,

05:47.660 --> 05:49.460
then I'm already
obsessed with you.

05:49.490 --> 05:51.290
As long as you don't
start dressing like me,

05:51.330 --> 05:53.830
acting like me, and then kill me
and take my place.

05:53.860 --> 05:55.090
My god,

05:55.130 --> 05:57.660
she's even funnier
than you said she was.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.230
You said I was funny?

05:59.270 --> 06:00.400
You are.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.240
In a very specific way.

06:02.270 --> 06:03.500
Are you coming to the movie?

06:03.540 --> 06:05.240
Yeah, why not come with us?

06:05.270 --> 06:07.540
No. I-I've got plans.

06:07.580 --> 06:10.610
But... it was really nice
to meet you, Missy.

06:19.390 --> 06:20.520
Hey.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.020
Hey.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.160
Thanks.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.230
Thank you for meeting with me

06:33.270 --> 06:34.533
on such short notice,
assistant secretary.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.000
It's good to see
you, agent Thomas.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.940
And your timing
is excellent, actually.

06:38.970 --> 06:40.840
I've been meaning to call you,

06:40.880 --> 06:42.780
but things have been
upside down at the D.O.J.

06:42.810 --> 06:44.373
Things have been hectic
on my end as well.

06:44.380 --> 06:46.050
Have they been?

06:46.080 --> 06:47.273
That's actually
what I was planning

06:47.280 --> 06:49.180
on reaching out to you about.

06:49.220 --> 06:51.250
Is this about my caseload?

06:51.290 --> 06:54.520
I have very good reason to have
fallen behind on my quota.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.260
Which is why I'm here.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.690
I've been working on a case.

06:58.730 --> 07:00.790
I need your help to take it
to the next level.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.560
Your e-mail,
you said something about

07:02.600 --> 07:04.323
search and seizure warrants
on a well-known public figure.

07:04.330 --> 07:06.570
I need to locate
Malcolm Dreyfuss.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.593
The tech billionaire who
recently shuttered his company?

07:08.600 --> 07:09.840
He's recently transferred

07:09.870 --> 07:12.110
hundreds of millions
of dollars to offshore accounts.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.740
He's gone off the grid,
just vanished.

07:13.780 --> 07:15.740
I believe that he is behind

07:15.780 --> 07:17.340
numerous criminal activities.

07:17.380 --> 07:19.750
Everything from the defacement
of the Lincoln memorial

07:19.780 --> 07:22.520
to the disappearance
of a Smithsonian security guard.

07:22.550 --> 07:25.550
And I need the authority
to follow up.

07:25.590 --> 07:27.050
This is thin.

07:27.090 --> 07:28.390
And you know it.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.760
You told me once, years ago,

07:29.790 --> 07:32.530
there is more than paper
to a case, there is intuition.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.060
Believe me when I tell you,

07:34.100 --> 07:36.460
I know this guy
is up to no good.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.600
And I know
when the blinders come on.

07:39.630 --> 07:41.470
This is some kind of
personal crusade.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.340
You're seeing red, and therefore

07:43.370 --> 07:45.570
not seeing clearly.

07:45.610 --> 07:46.740
Look, I'm late

07:46.780 --> 07:49.280
for a conference
at the Eisenhower building.

07:49.310 --> 07:51.640
As close as we are,
you know I can't help you

07:51.680 --> 07:53.250
unless you bring me more, so,

07:53.280 --> 07:54.350
find it.

07:54.380 --> 07:56.280
Thank you, assistant secretary.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.180
Take care of yourself,
agent Thomas.

08:04.190 --> 08:05.860
Thank you. Right
this way, please.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.960
The hell?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.670
Hello, officer.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.370
Everything copacetic?

08:23.410 --> 08:24.680
This way, please.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.740
You must be famished,
after a century and a half.

09:25.740 --> 09:26.970
Have at it.

09:27.740 --> 09:28.810
Sate your hunger.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.980
Nothing beats
Penfolds grange '99.

09:38.020 --> 09:39.183
This bill you wanted
to talk about.

09:39.190 --> 09:42.160
538. Does that impossible thing.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.720
Saves the world
and makes states money.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.130
It's a no-brainer.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.660
I just want you to put it
in front of him.

09:56.170 --> 09:57.540
Just...

10:04.350 --> 10:05.680
Don't hold back?

10:13.490 --> 10:15.050
The hell, Larry?

10:20.760 --> 10:21.960
Stop, man! Stop!

10:23.730 --> 10:25.160
I'm gonna get some help!

11:14.400 --> 11:16.770
Saw the victim gorge himself
on everything in sight.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.000
But the coroner's follow-up

11:19.040 --> 11:20.470
says he died of malnourishment,

11:20.500 --> 11:22.140
as in he literally
starved to death.

11:22.170 --> 11:25.410
A hunger this dreadful with
no sustenance can only have

11:25.440 --> 11:26.710
a supernatural cause.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.380
This could be a lot of things.

11:28.410 --> 11:30.210
Now...

11:30.250 --> 11:32.280
There's a creature
called a Vetala,

11:32.320 --> 11:34.280
which psychically
drains its prey.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.620
We dealt with one of those.

11:35.650 --> 11:36.913
The victims don't
stuff themselves.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.290
How about a succubus?

11:38.320 --> 11:40.120
They can supposedly
inflame desires, right?

11:40.160 --> 11:41.890
I experienced
one of those personally.

11:41.930 --> 11:44.460
They leave a desiccated corpse,
but no sign of malnutrition.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.220
Maybe you guys want
to save us some research

11:46.230 --> 11:48.630
and make a list of the vampiric
creatures you haven't fought.

11:49.570 --> 11:52.230
Never an actual vampire,
now that you mention it.

11:52.270 --> 11:55.100
In Greek mythology, Erysichthon
of Thessaly was cursed

11:55.140 --> 11:56.770
with an unrelenting hunger.

11:56.810 --> 12:00.310
Food merely served
as fuel for the fire.

12:00.340 --> 12:03.110
Perhaps this is
a similar malediction.

12:03.150 --> 12:05.580
Whatever demon
or monster curse this is,

12:05.620 --> 12:06.860
we all know where it came from.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.850
Dreyfuss.

12:08.890 --> 12:10.490
The straightest line
to ending this

12:10.520 --> 12:13.090
or whatever other threat
this bastard is cooking up,

12:13.120 --> 12:14.690
is to take him down.

12:14.730 --> 12:17.130
We all agree on the root cause,
agent Thomas.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.430
We have no idea
to where Dreyfuss vanished,

12:19.460 --> 12:21.560
nor what he is planning;
What we do know

12:21.600 --> 12:24.430
is that innocent lives
are in immediate danger.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.640
How long are we gonna
treat the symptoms

12:26.670 --> 12:28.870
and leave the disease unchecked?

12:28.910 --> 12:30.270
I am using

12:30.310 --> 12:31.570
every resource that I have

12:31.610 --> 12:32.840
to find him.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.140
I could use all your help.

12:39.350 --> 12:40.980
We get it.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.520
Yeah, absolutely.

12:42.550 --> 12:44.613
All right, we all want to find
a way to take him down.

12:44.620 --> 12:48.420
Dreyfuss stuck too close to home
when he went after Molly.

12:48.460 --> 12:51.430
Your instinct as a mother
is to act quickly.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.130
Quite rightly so.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.800
I give you my word,

12:54.830 --> 12:57.030
we will bring him down
by hook or by crook,

12:57.070 --> 13:00.200
but first we must contain
the situation at hand.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.810
Fine.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.710
We'll do it your way.

13:08.750 --> 13:09.810
Now...

13:09.850 --> 13:12.250
There are
many types of hunger demons

13:12.280 --> 13:14.480
that might cause
these sorts of symptoms.

13:14.520 --> 13:18.520
The ancient Chinese scholar
Pu Songling cataloged them

13:18.560 --> 13:21.920
<i>by genus and type
in a book called Liaozhai Zhiyi</i>

13:21.960 --> 13:23.490
during the Qing dynasty.

13:23.530 --> 13:24.790
I know a guy...

13:24.830 --> 13:27.000
Who might have
a book like that handy?

13:27.030 --> 13:29.200
Girl, you so have a type.

13:29.230 --> 13:30.300
Very good.

13:30.330 --> 13:31.693
Miss Jenny,
if you pursue that lead,

13:31.700 --> 13:33.293
agent Thomas and I
will reconnoiter the scene

13:33.300 --> 13:35.270
at the Eisenhower building.

13:35.310 --> 13:38.510
We will search for clues
as to the monster's whereabouts,

13:38.540 --> 13:40.480
and Dreyfuss' endgame.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.250
You two, on me.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.190
While we search the scene,

13:53.220 --> 13:55.220
I need you two
to stay on Dreyfuss.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.083
There are a number of leads
I was gonna chase down,

13:57.090 --> 13:58.730
starting with his assistant.

13:58.760 --> 13:59.840
If the thing made that dude

13:59.860 --> 14:01.930
go all "one more tiny
wafer-thin mint"

14:01.970 --> 14:03.263
is at the Eisenhower
building, what?

14:03.270 --> 14:05.330
Crane and I have it covered.

14:05.370 --> 14:06.700
Shall we, agent Thomas?

14:16.450 --> 14:17.530
I don't know. I don't know.

14:33.930 --> 14:35.430
How may this student

14:35.470 --> 14:37.330
of mystic herbology
help you today?

14:37.370 --> 14:38.930
Donnie Lu.

14:38.970 --> 14:41.240
Since when did you learn
how to read mandarin?

14:41.270 --> 14:42.700
Mills.

14:42.740 --> 14:44.370
No way.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.480
My god, it's been too long!

14:49.410 --> 14:50.750
Hey, is your uncle around?

14:50.780 --> 14:52.450
He's down in Charlotte Amalie

14:52.480 --> 14:53.820
with his boys... some kind of

14:53.850 --> 14:55.550
high-stakes poker game weekend.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.320
So I'm working the register.

14:57.350 --> 14:58.950
That doesn't sound
like your style.

14:58.990 --> 15:01.720
Last I heard, you had
a fleet of g4s for rent

15:01.760 --> 15:03.260
and were raking it in.

15:03.290 --> 15:05.560
Nah, I got out of jets.
The upkeep is murder.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.800
And this place
has been killing it.

15:07.830 --> 15:09.660
Chinese herbs are super in.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.470
Royal jelly, kombucha,
ginseng tea.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.100
People want to
live forever, dude.

15:14.140 --> 15:16.300
Seems to be a trend these days.

15:16.340 --> 15:19.610
Hey, I'm looking for a Qing
dynasty text on hunger demons.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.480
Say no more.

15:21.510 --> 15:23.550
Let me check
my mystical inventory

15:23.580 --> 15:25.910
of ancient tomes and scrolls.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.380
Wait, go back.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.390
It's the Gjallerhorn
of Heimdallr, right?

15:31.420 --> 15:33.920
Collector out of Dubai
is looking to track it down.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.220
He's got deep pockets.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.460
It's like one month in Nepal,

15:36.490 --> 15:37.960
two in Bangkok,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.960
bathysphere down
the Marianas trench.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.260
It's crazy.

15:42.300 --> 15:45.000
I'd ask if you're in, but
you're out of the game, right?

15:45.940 --> 15:47.270
Not "out" out.

15:48.610 --> 15:50.340
Just had a lot
on my plate recently.

15:50.370 --> 15:52.110
Who's taking point?

15:52.140 --> 15:53.340
Gonzalez?

15:53.380 --> 15:55.310
Dresden. No, wait,

15:55.350 --> 15:56.743
uncle Lu and Agatha Muir
go way, way back.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.850
No one yet.

16:01.180 --> 16:03.050
It's yours if you want it.

16:03.090 --> 16:05.090
Hand-pick your own team.

16:06.490 --> 16:08.320
Uncle Lu would be so psyched.

16:10.430 --> 16:12.190
You're one of the greats, mills.

16:14.260 --> 16:15.500
Let me think on it.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.230
And, um...

16:20.970 --> 16:22.840
Let me see that book
on hunger demon lore.

16:22.870 --> 16:24.270
Okay, you got it.

16:32.850 --> 16:35.180
In Latin, "lustitia."

16:35.220 --> 16:37.620
In Greek, "themis."

16:37.650 --> 16:40.790
Lady justice is
the allegorical personification

16:40.820 --> 16:43.790
of moral force
in the judicial system.

16:43.830 --> 16:46.830
In her hands,
the scales of justice.

16:46.860 --> 16:49.230
Always equal, always equivocal.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.000
Don't look so equal to me.

16:57.370 --> 16:59.433
If Dreyfuss is behind this,
then whatever's causing it,

16:59.440 --> 17:01.580
maybe we can use it
to track it back to him.

17:01.610 --> 17:03.280
Then we start upstairs
in the dining room.

17:03.310 --> 17:04.880
<i>All security teams, sector 4.</i>

17:04.920 --> 17:06.210
<i>All security teams, sector 4.</i>

17:06.250 --> 17:07.550
Or wherever they're going.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.190
Lady, get up.

17:16.230 --> 17:18.190
Get up now! Back away!

17:18.230 --> 17:20.730
Agent Thomas, DHS. What is going...?
Back away, slowly.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.160
Put your hands where
I can see them!

17:25.240 --> 17:27.470
Assistant secretary Stryker?

17:27.500 --> 17:29.070
You know this woman?

17:29.110 --> 17:31.170
My god. Nancy.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.250
The thing that did this...

17:41.280 --> 17:42.780
it's in the walls.

17:53.260 --> 17:56.190
Hey, you okay?

17:56.220 --> 17:58.830
Agent Thomas
knew this poor soul.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.330
It's another life.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.460
Dreyfuss is gonna pay for.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.570
You said you saw it

18:07.600 --> 18:09.270
behind that vent?

18:09.300 --> 18:12.240
Only the eyes. They glowed red.

18:12.270 --> 18:15.440
Crimson eyes, desiccated bodies,

18:15.480 --> 18:17.380
and a propensity
for living in darkness.

18:17.410 --> 18:20.350
All characteristics of a number
of genera of hunger demon.

18:25.950 --> 18:28.660
There's a whole host
cataloged in here.

18:30.860 --> 18:34.560
Gaki, egui, preta.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.760
There's even a demonic strain
fathered by Mnemoth.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.200
Some are thought
to be responsible

18:39.230 --> 18:40.670
for the great famines
of history.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.670
Hold up. Two attacks today.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.600
This creature was
released recently.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.210
And if Dreyfuss had a hand,

18:46.240 --> 18:47.870
he may have left a trail.

18:57.990 --> 19:00.190
There.

19:00.220 --> 19:01.520
Jobe.

19:01.560 --> 19:02.890
Proof that Dreyfuss is involved.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.190
You saw the demon in

19:04.230 --> 19:05.353
the ventilation
duct system, right?

19:05.360 --> 19:07.560
And Jobe was headed
to the basement.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.560
Can we access the building's
utility schematics from here?

19:10.600 --> 19:11.770
I think so.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.740
The central hub
for the building's

19:15.770 --> 19:17.540
ventilation system
is in the sub-basement.

19:17.570 --> 19:19.563
Allowing the creature access
to both the dining room

19:19.570 --> 19:21.840
and the conference room.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.510
And the rest of the building.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.610
This is one of the biggest
office buildings in D.C.

19:25.650 --> 19:26.980
It's an all-you-can-eat buffet.

19:27.020 --> 19:28.780
So we got to go down
and find it.

19:28.820 --> 19:31.720
Hold on. It's kind of odd shape.

19:31.750 --> 19:34.020
He could be carrying
an artifact.

19:34.060 --> 19:35.620
There's a chapter in here about

19:35.660 --> 19:36.720
the Mifang conundrum.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.330
Chinese mystics
created enchanted

19:39.360 --> 19:41.160
puzzle box mechanisms that,

19:41.200 --> 19:42.700
depending on the configuration,

19:42.730 --> 19:46.030
could draw, trap
or release a hunger demon.

19:46.070 --> 19:48.200
They vary in complexity.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.400
Some take as many as

19:49.440 --> 19:52.440
1,536 predetermined
moves to open.

19:52.470 --> 19:54.770
I've seen this device before.

19:54.810 --> 19:56.610
In the hands of a former
compatriot of mine.

19:58.250 --> 20:01.010
Before I joined
the colonial forces,

20:01.050 --> 20:02.950
I was friends with a
fellow British officer

20:02.980 --> 20:04.950
named Edward Reed.

20:06.590 --> 20:08.620
<i>Shortly after I arrived
on American shores,</i>

20:08.660 --> 20:10.790
<i>Reed and I were sent on a raid</i>

20:10.830 --> 20:14.730
<i>to recapture a supply room
commandeered by the colonists.</i>

20:24.370 --> 20:27.040
Relax, crane.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.540
The colonials would not be
so rash as to risk their lives

20:29.580 --> 20:30.910
over crates of tea.

20:30.950 --> 20:32.610
I would not be so sure, sir.

20:32.650 --> 20:34.610
These Bostonians are proud men.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.420
It seems they would
gladly give their lives

20:36.450 --> 20:37.780
for the pursuit of freedom.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.850
Good luck to them.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.720
Rabble against the might
of empire, right?

20:43.960 --> 20:46.690
Damn this foul contraption.

20:46.730 --> 20:49.060
It's a peculiar curio.

20:49.100 --> 20:51.700
Are those Chinese characters?

20:51.730 --> 20:55.070
Well, I found it here,
in one of the open tea crates.

20:55.100 --> 20:57.670
A misplaced child's
plaything perhaps.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.070
My youngest, Penelope,

20:59.110 --> 21:00.970
she's quite adept
with this sort of thing.

21:04.380 --> 21:07.310
Perhaps I'll take it with me
when we return home.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.850
A day that cannot
come soon enough.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.090
Thereafter, I was sent on
a different assignment.

21:17.130 --> 21:18.890
And when I returned, I was told

21:18.930 --> 21:20.630
that Reed
and the rest of the company

21:20.660 --> 21:22.860
had all died of starvation

21:22.900 --> 21:25.970
whilst on a reconnaissance
north of the Berkshires.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.170
Reed must have inadvertently
summoned a hunger demon,

21:30.210 --> 21:34.770
by solving what he believed
to be a child's puzzle.

21:34.810 --> 21:37.080
Ultimately, we fought
on different sides,

21:37.110 --> 21:39.480
but no man
deserves a death so foul.

21:39.510 --> 21:40.950
We find this puzzle box,

21:40.980 --> 21:42.620
we can lure the demon.

21:42.650 --> 21:43.980
Trap it.

21:44.020 --> 21:46.950
Then we track down
the bastard who set it free

21:46.990 --> 21:48.290
and make him pay.

21:52.030 --> 21:53.660
Okay, spymaster.

21:53.700 --> 21:56.500
Diana said start with Dreyfuss's
assistant, not grab dinner.

21:56.530 --> 21:59.330
Picagram doesn't lie, my friend.

21:59.370 --> 22:01.500
Dreyfuss's assistant
Ashley's feed tells me

22:01.540 --> 22:03.740
that she's super into street cuisine.

22:03.770 --> 22:05.670
She's tagged herself
at that truck

22:05.710 --> 22:07.873
every Friday during happy hour
for the last three months.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.510
Okay, so, if she's a
creature of habit,

22:09.540 --> 22:11.040
she should be here any minute.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.480
Exactly. But you,

22:12.510 --> 22:14.410
might miss that screening
with what's-her-face.

22:14.450 --> 22:15.680
Missy?

22:15.720 --> 22:17.250
No worries, it's not like

22:17.290 --> 22:19.290
we can't find
something else to do.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.513
You know, we have
a ton in common

22:20.520 --> 22:22.760
besides old black-and-white
horror movies.

22:22.790 --> 22:24.920
Yeah, pricey French wine,

22:24.960 --> 22:27.360
vintage Elric of Melnibon
sword and sorcery paperbacks.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.430
Melni-what?

22:29.460 --> 22:30.800
That's a real thing?

22:30.830 --> 22:31.800
Yeah.

22:31.830 --> 22:33.730
Whatever.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.570
Just don't get too cocky, okay?

22:35.600 --> 22:37.863
'Cause people with too much
in common, they never work out.

22:37.870 --> 22:40.510
But didn't you say
the exact opposite

22:40.540 --> 22:42.540
when I was crushing on
Jenny mills, though?

22:44.550 --> 22:45.750
There she is.

22:45.780 --> 22:47.710
That's Ashley.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.150
So, what...

22:49.180 --> 22:50.380
Bluetooth scanner.

22:50.420 --> 22:51.380
Patent pending.

22:51.420 --> 22:53.190
Not exactly legal yet.

22:53.220 --> 22:57.590
But I can use a remote link
to clone Ashley's SIM card.

22:57.630 --> 23:01.190
That way, if and when
Dreyfuss calls, we can piggyback

23:01.230 --> 23:03.260
and use cell tower triangulation
to locate him.

23:03.300 --> 23:06.600
But, not too close, Romeo.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.640
Just because you score
with girls at bars

23:08.670 --> 23:10.440
doesn't mean that
puppy dog charm of yours

23:10.470 --> 23:11.440
is gonna serve you here.

23:11.470 --> 23:13.110
Puppy dog charm?

23:13.140 --> 23:14.640
That's what I said.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.910
Yeah, it was. I mean,
it wasn't much of one,

23:16.950 --> 23:19.410
but I believe you
just complimented me.

23:19.450 --> 23:20.750
No.

23:20.780 --> 23:24.380
I described you,
using canines as a comparison.

23:24.420 --> 23:26.850
The word that
jumped out was "charming."

23:26.890 --> 23:27.890
Yeah.

23:58.590 --> 24:01.420
You do not find him charming.

24:14.140 --> 24:16.040
We should double our efforts.

24:16.070 --> 24:17.970
I'll take right. Okay.

24:28.180 --> 24:29.580
Over here.

24:32.950 --> 24:34.620
I believe we have
found the source

24:34.660 --> 24:36.990
of our demonic infestation.

24:37.030 --> 24:39.590
But how does it work?

24:39.630 --> 24:42.130
See if there's any information
in the book I got from Donnie.

24:43.770 --> 24:47.100
I'm gonna do a sweep, make sure
this demon isn't lurking around.

24:47.140 --> 24:49.700
If we dial in
on the correct configuration,

24:49.740 --> 24:52.670
we should be able
to call the creature back here.

24:52.710 --> 24:54.710
These are shang characters.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.880
So...

24:59.910 --> 25:01.710
That one there...

25:01.750 --> 25:04.350
Means "return to."

25:04.390 --> 25:05.720
And then, on the other side,

25:05.750 --> 25:07.690
"to cast away."

25:07.720 --> 25:09.360
And the third,

25:09.390 --> 25:11.520
"to restrain."

25:11.560 --> 25:14.160
Configuration is the key.

25:14.200 --> 25:18.900
Fortunately, I was most
adept at puzzles, so...

25:25.370 --> 25:26.540
Confounding.

25:26.570 --> 25:28.670
Hey, I was a master
at Rubik's cube.

25:28.710 --> 25:30.710
I have no idea
what you just said.

25:30.750 --> 25:33.280
But I do know that I solved
Franklin's cipher

25:33.310 --> 25:34.850
when many others had failed.

25:34.880 --> 25:37.680
And I was able to drink from
the most challenging puzzle jug

25:37.720 --> 25:39.690
without spilling a drop,
so perhaps I should...

25:39.720 --> 25:40.720
Got it.

25:52.770 --> 25:54.530
Talk to me.

25:54.570 --> 25:56.570
<i>Dreyfuss assistant</i>

25:56.600 --> 25:57.703
was a rainbow of flying colors.

25:57.710 --> 25:58.940
Excellent.

25:58.970 --> 26:00.440
<i>You have his location? Not yet,</i>

26:00.480 --> 26:02.940
but I have a program scanning
cell towers across the U.S.,

26:02.980 --> 26:04.580
looking for common
I.P. Addresses.

26:04.610 --> 26:05.910
All right, keep digging.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.250
Okay. Crane! Jenny!

26:11.720 --> 26:13.050
Come on.

26:13.090 --> 26:14.520
Trap it. Trap it!

26:18.430 --> 26:19.630
Jenny, you okay?

26:19.660 --> 26:20.660
Yeah.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.700
Where is it?

26:35.880 --> 26:36.880
Behind you!

26:42.320 --> 26:43.650
After it! Quickly! Follow it!

26:48.960 --> 26:50.390
Come on.

26:52.060 --> 26:54.790
No sign of the demon.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.460
Without the puzzle box,
we can't call it back.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.430
Leaving a voracious creature
free to sate its hunger

27:00.470 --> 27:02.800
amongst the innocent denizens
of Washington.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.790
But perseverance
eventually paid off.

27:11.830 --> 27:15.330
Could use some serious
cleaning supplies down here.

27:15.370 --> 27:19.800
Fresh coat of white paint
would do... wonders.

27:21.710 --> 27:23.670
Dark rider of death.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.510
I think you're right, Jobe.

27:25.540 --> 27:29.350
He does look a little...
Under the weather.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.850
He suffered these
wounds while under

27:32.880 --> 27:35.520
the transformative influence
of the philosopher's stone.

27:53.840 --> 27:57.540
I am so, so sorry, my friend.

27:57.580 --> 28:00.180
You've been dealt
a great disservice.

28:00.210 --> 28:01.710
But fear not,

28:01.750 --> 28:04.710
I've come to restore you
to all your glory.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.180
I made you a promise
when we first met,

28:07.220 --> 28:09.220
and I never welsh on a deal.

28:09.250 --> 28:13.020
We're gonna have you
on the mend before you know it.

28:13.060 --> 28:14.960
And...

28:14.990 --> 28:19.460
I am getting the gang

28:19.500 --> 28:21.430
back together again.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.200
<i>This is on me.</i>

28:26.240 --> 28:27.503
If I hadn't
taken that phone call,

28:27.510 --> 28:29.563
the hunger demon wouldn't
have gotten the drop on us.

28:29.570 --> 28:31.870
More pressing is the fact
that we were unaware

28:31.910 --> 28:33.910
you had employed
master Jake and miss Alex

28:33.950 --> 28:35.810
on an information gathering
mission.

28:35.850 --> 28:37.650
I didn't want to
drop the ball on Dreyfuss,

28:37.680 --> 28:39.750
I thought a two-pronged assault
was right.

28:39.780 --> 28:41.520
Yes, the plan is not the issue.

28:42.790 --> 28:46.460
The issue is that you chose
not to share it with all of us.

28:52.730 --> 28:55.670
We understand your anger,
agent Thomas.

28:55.700 --> 28:57.870
And your right to it.

28:57.900 --> 29:01.000
But what is at risk
is the integrity of our team.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.300
If we are to be successful

29:02.340 --> 29:03.563
in our battle
against the supernatural,

29:03.570 --> 29:06.680
we must always stay
on the same page.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.450
Trust us,

29:09.480 --> 29:13.220
separate agendas will only
lead the group astray.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.520
I hear you.

29:19.060 --> 29:20.340
Then let's put
our heads together

29:20.360 --> 29:21.653
and take this thing out already?

29:21.660 --> 29:23.630
Okay, look, I was
combing through

29:23.660 --> 29:26.500
entries in the secret histories,
looking for any reference

29:26.530 --> 29:28.300
to hunger demons,
cannibalism or famine,

29:28.330 --> 29:31.430
and I found one about
the Donner party.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.970
The Oregon trail people who got
snowed in and ate each other?

29:35.010 --> 29:37.173
They were trying to forge their
way across the high sierras.

29:37.180 --> 29:38.770
May I see the entry?

29:38.810 --> 29:41.110
You think the Donner party
went cannibal

29:41.150 --> 29:44.210
because they ran afoul
of one of the hunger demons?

29:44.250 --> 29:45.610
My.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.880
One of the leaders of the party
was one James F. Reed.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.020
He was a direct descendant
of Edward Reed,

29:53.060 --> 29:54.623
my former commanding officer
in the British army.

29:54.630 --> 29:56.430
It's the Mifang conundrum.

29:56.460 --> 29:58.060
Was it passed down
in his family?

29:58.100 --> 30:01.360
And brought with the
Donner party on their journey.

30:01.400 --> 30:05.170
Here, Reed survived
and wrote this account.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.570
<i>In the spring of 1848,
the snow in the passes</i>

30:08.610 --> 30:11.070
<i>finally melted enough
for the Donner party survivors</i>

30:11.110 --> 30:13.210
<i>to make their way to safety.</i>

30:15.510 --> 30:18.710
<i>But they did not come out alone.</i>

30:25.960 --> 30:28.720
<i>Led by James F. Reed,
they made their way west</i>

30:28.760 --> 30:31.230
<i>and took shelter
from their demonic pursuer</i>

30:31.260 --> 30:32.860
<i>in a cave system.</i>

30:32.900 --> 30:35.000
<i>The Donner party survivors</i>

30:35.030 --> 30:38.430
<i>made their last stand
at the mouth of this cave,</i>

30:38.470 --> 30:42.040
<i>just outside the town
of Sutter's mill.</i>

30:42.070 --> 30:45.410
<i>James F. Reed laid a trap
for the demon...</i>

30:47.550 --> 30:51.610
<i>volunteered himself as bait
to lure the foul beast.</i>

31:16.210 --> 31:18.840
<i>The survivors dug Reed out.</i>

31:18.880 --> 31:21.840
Of the creature,
there was no sign.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.550
There was a literal

31:24.580 --> 31:26.750
golden lining to this story.

31:26.780 --> 31:30.490
A vein of gold ore uncovered
in the explosion was mined

31:30.520 --> 31:32.760
and provided
for the survivors' recovery

31:32.790 --> 31:34.890
and eventual prosperity.

31:34.930 --> 31:35.890
Whoa, wait..

31:35.930 --> 31:39.400
1848.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.060
Sutter's mill, California?

31:41.100 --> 31:42.500
You're saying that

31:42.530 --> 31:44.093
when the Donner party
took out this demon...

31:44.100 --> 31:45.800
They kicked off the gold rush.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.070
In our world,
and only in our world,

31:48.110 --> 31:49.570
does that make sense.

31:49.610 --> 31:51.810
The Donner party's tragic tale
must provide the key

31:51.840 --> 31:54.140
to defeating this demon.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.310
The Mifang conundrum boxes

31:56.350 --> 31:58.350
were fashioned
out of enchanted teakwood,

31:58.380 --> 32:02.520
but they had gold characters
emblazoned on the sides.

32:02.550 --> 32:03.950
Gold.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.820
Gold is the creature's weakness.

32:05.860 --> 32:08.180
It's mine, too, but I don't have
enough to create a weapon.

32:09.430 --> 32:11.660
I've got a plan for that.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.230
But first we need to
draw the creature,

32:13.260 --> 32:15.100
and the puzzle box is
a pile of splinters.

32:15.130 --> 32:16.900
I can 3-d-print a replica.

32:16.930 --> 32:18.970
I mean, not out of
enchanted teakwood,

32:19.000 --> 32:21.570
but it might be able to hold
the demon for a little bit,

32:21.610 --> 32:23.740
if at all. As long as it
will lure it towards us.

32:23.770 --> 32:25.110
Look, I'll research

32:25.140 --> 32:27.280
the correct symbology
to paint in gold leaf

32:27.310 --> 32:28.510
onto your version of the box.

32:28.550 --> 32:29.510
Very good.

32:29.550 --> 32:31.350
Now, miss Jenny,
you say you have a plan

32:31.380 --> 32:34.120
to procure enough gold
to make weaponry.

32:34.150 --> 32:35.220
I do.

32:35.250 --> 32:36.890
But we've got to
mine it ourselves.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.620
This is a junkyard.

32:40.660 --> 32:42.960
That's what you see.

32:42.990 --> 32:45.030
I see gold.

32:49.940 --> 32:51.480
Take down this demon?

32:51.510 --> 32:54.680
Okay, it's a little known
fact, but cars are filled

32:54.710 --> 32:56.750
with trace amounts of gold.

32:56.780 --> 32:59.920
Anti-lock brakes,
airbag inflation system chips.

32:59.950 --> 33:02.120
Come on. If gold was
laying around in cars,

33:02.160 --> 33:03.320
people would steal it.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.820
Yeah, they do.

33:04.860 --> 33:06.720
I had a friend
that used to use skateboards

33:06.760 --> 33:09.023
to slide under the cars and
dismantle catalytic converters.

33:09.030 --> 33:11.130
She'd strip and sell the gold
inside for beer money.

33:11.160 --> 33:13.730
She called it a,
"catalytic conversion rate."

33:13.770 --> 33:15.230
Did she?

33:15.270 --> 33:16.730
A friend?

33:16.770 --> 33:18.270
Okay, so, there's trace amounts

33:18.300 --> 33:19.800
of gold in every car.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.833
And with this many cars, means
a heck of a lot of gold, right?

33:21.840 --> 33:24.740
Which means we can create
our own Donner party gold mine

33:24.780 --> 33:26.080
with what we have to hand.

33:26.110 --> 33:27.110
This thing,

33:27.150 --> 33:28.350
it attacks from high,

33:28.380 --> 33:30.410
causing its victims
to attack each other.

33:30.450 --> 33:33.480
But in close quarters,
it will fight hand-to-hand.

33:33.520 --> 33:37.120
So, to avoid eating each other,
we should force the latter.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.790
That is the approach
we shall take.

33:38.830 --> 33:39.720
Miss Alex, do you have

33:39.760 --> 33:40.790
the facsimile box?

33:40.830 --> 33:41.790
Yeah.

33:41.830 --> 33:42.990
Now, I'm all set

33:43.030 --> 33:44.330
to apply the symbols on this box

33:44.360 --> 33:45.700
once we do have
some gold in hand.

33:45.730 --> 33:47.700
Yeah, and while Jake
was doing his research,

33:47.730 --> 33:49.770
I came up with these.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.970
This is fluorosulfuric acid.

33:56.010 --> 33:59.240
Any spare gold we have, we drop
in here and we get a solution

33:59.280 --> 34:00.540
that might take this thing out.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.680
Nice.

34:01.710 --> 34:05.080
Excellent work, all.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.590
Now let us commence prospecting.

34:11.659 --> 34:13.719
Ready as we'll ever be.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.860
It's a good plan, crane.

34:16.900 --> 34:19.000
It was a group effort.

34:19.030 --> 34:22.670
Our team has endured much
in its short life.

34:22.699 --> 34:24.699
It has continually proved
to be far greater

34:24.739 --> 34:26.500
than the sum of its parts.

34:26.540 --> 34:30.310
It has been a unique experience.

34:30.340 --> 34:32.210
Indeed it has.

34:32.250 --> 34:36.710
Miss Jenny pointed out
that D.C. is becoming

34:36.750 --> 34:40.150
more of a home for me.

34:40.190 --> 34:42.690
It is largely thanks
to you and miss Molly.

34:42.719 --> 34:46.120
You accepted me into your lives,

34:46.159 --> 34:48.090
and it means a great deal to...

34:50.130 --> 34:54.730
Well, you've given us
a real sense of purpose.

34:54.770 --> 34:56.929
Knowing we're saving the world

34:56.969 --> 34:59.570
from monsters?

34:59.610 --> 35:02.240
Not a job I would've
willingly signed up for, though.

35:02.280 --> 35:05.810
Dreadfully lacking in benefits.

35:05.850 --> 35:07.910
Alex and Jake are ready
with the puzzle box.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.120
Let's do this.

35:16.190 --> 35:17.990
Okay.

35:18.020 --> 35:19.960
This should draw
the demon to us.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.080
It's working.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.773
You say that like
you weren't sure it would.

35:44.780 --> 35:46.120
I wasn't.

35:46.150 --> 35:48.420
But let's not sweat
the small stuff, okay?

36:15.450 --> 36:17.050
Nowhere to run, demon.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.980
You're encircled
in a ring of gold.

36:27.830 --> 36:30.130
It's trapped.
Now we finish this.

36:35.630 --> 36:36.733
Its eyes are doing the thing!

36:36.740 --> 36:38.140
Crane, another arrow!

36:41.740 --> 36:43.670
Jenny! Now!

36:52.020 --> 36:53.580
Jake, Alex! Come on!

37:09.140 --> 37:11.800
Gold solution

37:11.840 --> 37:13.140
was a smashing success.

37:13.170 --> 37:14.870
You know... no...

37:14.910 --> 37:17.340
Operation, Hangry demon take...

37:17.380 --> 37:18.440
Jake. Yeah.

37:18.480 --> 37:19.980
Just drop it. Okay.

37:20.010 --> 37:22.480
Actually, I'd go
with smashing success.

37:27.090 --> 37:29.730
Dreyfuss is a madman,
but he has a method.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.560
True. When he was assembling
the philosopher's stone,

37:32.600 --> 37:34.830
he released monsters
with a purpose.

37:34.870 --> 37:36.740
So we do a sweep, top to bottom,

37:36.770 --> 37:39.840
see if we can spot
anything off-kilter.

37:39.870 --> 37:41.870
I'll take the north end.

37:44.810 --> 37:48.150
Breaking into a government
building after hours.

37:48.180 --> 37:50.350
She can stay.

37:50.380 --> 37:51.420
Indeed.

37:51.450 --> 37:54.950
She has adjusted admirably.

37:54.990 --> 37:57.320
As have you and I.

37:57.360 --> 38:00.460
We've gathered quite
the formidable troop.

38:00.490 --> 38:02.960
Long may we reign.

38:05.730 --> 38:07.763
This is about the apartment
down the hall, isn't it?

38:07.770 --> 38:09.130
3c.

38:09.170 --> 38:11.540
It is a shade shabby,
but the spirit

38:11.570 --> 38:13.510
of the neighborhood
more than makes up for it.

38:15.110 --> 38:16.910
Yeah, I'm really...

38:16.940 --> 38:18.680
I'm okay with my trailer.

38:18.710 --> 38:20.250
For now.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.650
You know,

38:21.680 --> 38:24.880
with the respect
and admiration you command

38:24.920 --> 38:27.890
from our new compatriots,
and with...

38:29.690 --> 38:32.690
Well, you're fully aware that
I consider you as much family...

38:32.730 --> 38:34.390
Crane.

38:34.430 --> 38:35.760
Don't make it weird.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.360
I'm not making anything weird.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.800
All I'm trying to say,
if you will allow me, is that...

38:43.840 --> 38:48.340
you also have
more of a home than you know.

38:52.310 --> 38:54.280
I got offered a job today.

38:54.310 --> 38:56.550
And it's out of town.

38:56.580 --> 38:58.380
Way out of town.

38:58.420 --> 39:01.950
A really interesting gig,
doing just what I love,

39:01.990 --> 39:05.420
finding something special,
uncovering mysteries.

39:05.460 --> 39:07.990
Congratulat...

39:08.030 --> 39:09.690
Have you accepted?

39:09.730 --> 39:12.430
Not yet, but...

39:12.470 --> 39:14.130
I didn't say no.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.740
I think it's just because

39:17.770 --> 39:20.070
I wouldn't just be
a part of something.

39:20.110 --> 39:23.740
It... it'd be... my own thing.

39:25.350 --> 39:27.910
Hey, I think I found something!

39:32.750 --> 39:35.083
There was a tour guide with a
bunch of schoolkids here earlier

39:35.090 --> 39:36.753
when crane and I
first came to the building.

39:36.760 --> 39:42.060
And in that security footage,
Jobe paused here and looked up.

39:42.100 --> 39:44.230
I think that's
what he was looking at.

39:44.260 --> 39:47.270
Lady justice.

39:47.300 --> 39:50.000
Blind, equivocal...

39:50.040 --> 39:52.440
And missing something.

39:52.470 --> 39:54.840
There was a set
of golden scales up there.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.370
Now they're gone.

39:56.410 --> 39:58.380
We need to return to the vault,

39:58.410 --> 40:00.680
try to glean
what our enemy is planning.

40:05.050 --> 40:07.490
Why do we bother
to talk children

40:07.520 --> 40:10.160
into wishing upon stars?

40:10.190 --> 40:12.760
Pinpricks of light from
hundreds of thousands

40:12.790 --> 40:15.390
of years ago, which we have

40:15.430 --> 40:20.500
breathlessly assigned patterns
and form and meaning to...

40:20.530 --> 40:24.870
From a ridiculously simplistic
perspective.

40:24.910 --> 40:27.470
We really need to teach
future generations

40:27.510 --> 40:32.280
to bring about real
material change,

40:32.310 --> 40:35.810
not pin their hopes
on the ephemeral.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.780
You've killed the poetry,
Malcolm.

40:39.820 --> 40:44.560
All the more room for reason
and logic to stand tall.

40:44.590 --> 40:46.660
Scale me, my friend.

40:46.690 --> 40:49.960
Charged as the hunger demon fed.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.560
What an interesting dichotomy.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.930
Overflowing with famine.

40:58.740 --> 41:04.140
My young and rather stylish
rider of pestilence.

41:06.780 --> 41:10.350
And my ambitious,
social climbing,

41:10.380 --> 41:13.890
and savagely hungry...

41:13.920 --> 41:16.520
Rider of famine.

41:16.560 --> 41:21.160
Just two more spaces
left to fill, my friend.

41:21.190 --> 41:23.560
And I'm hoping the
dark rider of death

41:23.600 --> 41:26.360
will be strong enough
to rejoin us soon.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.930
The condition for his recovery

41:27.970 --> 41:31.740
will be attended to
immediately, Malcolm.

41:31.770 --> 41:35.810
And that will leave just
one last totem, Jobe.

41:37.610 --> 41:39.480
War.

41:40.910 --> 41:41.950
<i>So Dreyfuss</i>

41:41.980 --> 41:43.680
vandalized the Eisenhower
building,

41:43.720 --> 41:44.960
and took the scales of justice.

41:44.990 --> 41:47.890
Yes. A set of golden scales.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.590
It's not always seen
in the hands of lady themis.

41:50.620 --> 41:52.290
Correct, master Wells.

41:52.330 --> 41:55.230
Scales are a totem
in many mythologies.

41:55.260 --> 41:57.400
In the zodiac, Libra is a symbol

41:57.430 --> 41:59.330
of logic and balance.

41:59.370 --> 42:01.770
In biblical texts,
the scales are a symbol

42:01.800 --> 42:05.100
of dread and primal power.

42:07.670 --> 42:08.670
No.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.010
Malcolm Dreyfuss raised a djinn

42:12.050 --> 42:14.510
in order to spread
a supernatural pestilence.

42:14.550 --> 42:16.010
Now he raises a hunger demon

42:16.050 --> 42:18.250
in order to spread
a supernatural famine.

42:18.290 --> 42:20.490
I hope you're not thinking
what I think you're thinking.

42:24.830 --> 42:26.420
You are thinking what I was.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.730
Our enemy Dreyfuss

42:28.760 --> 42:32.060
seeks to raise the four horsemen
of the apocalypse.
