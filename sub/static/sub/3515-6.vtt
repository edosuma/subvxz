WEBVTT

00:21.320 --> 00:23.049
You wanted to see us?
Yeah.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.206
Going to be leaving
town for a little while.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.327
NICK: Vacation?

00:27.400 --> 00:28.920
That's what I'd
like everyone to think.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.962
Captain Harden will
take over while I'm away.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.880
Does this have to do
with your brother's death?

00:32.960 --> 00:34.041
Maybe.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.202
Now if you receive any communication
from me while I'm away,

00:36.280 --> 00:38.681
text, email, otherwise,
just ignore it.

00:38.760 --> 00:39.921
It won't be me.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.845
If I do need to contact you,

00:41.920 --> 00:43.729
I'll do it indirectly
through Rosalee.

00:43.800 --> 00:44.880
You in some kind of danger?

00:45.440 --> 00:46.646
I would assume so.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.169
Is there anything
we can do here?

00:49.800 --> 00:53.282
Yeah, if anyone asks, I'm having
a wonderful time in Tahiti.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.967
BOY: But why are we
coming here so late?

01:17.360 --> 01:20.204
Father Paul is going to
try and help you, okay?

01:20.280 --> 01:22.282
You're gonna be just fine, Son.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.640
He's not gonna give me a shot
like the doctors, is he?

01:34.720 --> 01:36.529
No. No, honey.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.850
The Monsignor is ready for you.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.043
Sorry, Monsignor,

01:57.200 --> 01:58.770
they're here.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.605
Bring them in.

02:22.040 --> 02:24.202
Daniel, I'm so glad you're here.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.610
Now there's nothing
to be afraid of.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.886
How are you feeling?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.286
Okay.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.131
You know I'm going
to try to help you.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.282
You understand that, don't you?

02:37.440 --> 02:38.805
All right.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.082
Everything's gonna be okay, Son.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.042
We are gonna be right outside.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.690
But I want to come with you.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.524
No. No, you have to...

02:50.080 --> 02:52.128
You have to stay here
with Monsignor Paul.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.602
Now, you know him. There's
nothing to be scared of.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.290
I don't understand why at least one
of us can't be in there with him.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.441
Here.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.001
Come here.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.044
It's going to be okay.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.801
It's going to work.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.968
What if it doesn't?
It has to.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.969
We have tried everything.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.685
We haven't tried this.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.611
(CHANTING IN LATIN)

04:09.080 --> 04:10.320
I want to go home.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.925
It'll be okay, Daniel.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.361
Hold him!

04:32.840 --> 04:34.649
Tie him so he
doesn't hurt himself.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.206
(CONTINUES CHANTING
IN LATIN)

04:37.480 --> 04:38.481
(GROWLS)

04:45.280 --> 04:47.282
What was that?
We better get in there.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.445
Let us in!

04:56.520 --> 04:59.046
Open! Open the door now!

05:01.040 --> 05:02.929
Open the door now!

05:39.600 --> 05:43.844
26-year-old male, identified as
Mathew Bard, was found unconscious.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.843
Seminary student working
here at the church.

05:45.920 --> 05:46.920
That's him.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.440
Inside we've got the body
of Monsignor Paul Dobbs.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.204
Monsignor Paul is dead?
Yeah.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.930
And not of natural causes.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.010
He's been here as
long as I can remember.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.129
We have a missing boy.
His name's Daniel Keary.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.605
Those are his parents.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.567
They're pretty shook up. They don't
know what happened to their son.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.926
Where did it all go down?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.729
Back here in the anteroom.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.406
There's an open window inside. We
think the boy went out that way.

06:12.480 --> 06:13.760
I've got officers on the street.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.564
The dad was pretty
frantic when we got here.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.644
He'd been looking all over.
I called in an APB.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.724
How old is the boy?
Nine.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.561
Parents forced the door open
after the whole thing went bad.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.484
And by "whole thing",
I mean what apparently

06:26.560 --> 06:27.721
was an exorcism.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.245
An exorcism?

06:37.240 --> 06:39.322
Parents called 911.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.004
Door was open when we got here.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.491
Same with the window.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.801
Where'd you find
the seminary student?

06:47.560 --> 06:50.040
Photo of the scene
as we found it.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.165
Hmm.
Who else was in the room?

06:53.240 --> 06:55.686
According to the Kearys,
just their son.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.530
Can a nine-year-old
boy do this?

06:57.760 --> 06:59.200
Maybe the adults
attacked each other.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.204
It took a lot of
force to do this.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.600
Well...

07:07.680 --> 07:09.170
The parents were
first in the room.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.203
You think they're on the level?

07:12.920 --> 07:14.160
(DISTANT BREATHING)

07:14.240 --> 07:15.480
Hold on.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.281
(DISTANT BREATHING)

07:17.480 --> 07:18.561
You hear that?

07:20.080 --> 07:21.445
What?

07:25.640 --> 07:26.641
(DISTANT BREATHING)

07:45.280 --> 07:46.406
NICK: Daniel...

07:47.880 --> 07:49.291
I'm Detective Burkhardt.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.410
Are you okay?

07:52.680 --> 07:54.364
You're safe now.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.000
You want to come out?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.923
Your parents are
in the other room.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.326
You want them to come in here?

08:01.600 --> 08:02.681
Yeah.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.565
I'll get them.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.251
You want to tell
me what happened?

08:07.720 --> 08:09.484
Did those men hurt you?

08:11.760 --> 08:14.570
All right, I'm gonna untie that
rope from around your wrist, okay?

08:15.400 --> 08:16.606
Okay.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.206
Mom!

08:31.640 --> 08:33.607
I want to make sure
that he doesn't see that.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.927
Come here, baby.
Come here.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.001
Oh, God, Tom.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.121
It's okay. He's okay.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.727
He's been through an enormous amount
of stress for a nine-year-old.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.280
His immune system has
been radically stressed,

09:12.360 --> 09:15.011
his platelets are down, and
his white count is elevated.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.003
We'll run panels again
in another 48 hours,

09:17.080 --> 09:18.411
see where he's at then.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.370
Preliminaries at the scene indicate a
fair amount of force and violence.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.805
We're not sure yet
who's responsible,

09:22.880 --> 09:24.211
but we wanted
your staff to know.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.805
How long before
we can talk to him?

09:25.880 --> 09:27.644
He's been sedated since arrival.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.245
We'll bring him out gradually.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.243
Give us 24 to 48 hours.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.688
TOM: Daniel just seemed
to change overnight.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.004
About a year ago

09:41.960 --> 09:43.849
he went from this
nice, sweet kid,

09:43.920 --> 09:46.048
to a boy that I don't
even know any more.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.328
He started having
these wild mood swings.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.681
You know, violent, abusive.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.604
You took him to the doctor,
psychiatrist?

09:53.800 --> 09:55.768
Yes, we took him
to every doctor,

09:55.840 --> 09:57.569
every specialist
that we could find.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.531
Nobody could diagnose him.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.490
Daniel doesn't even know when
he's having one of these things.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.761
Monsignor Paul told
us that there are...

10:06.840 --> 10:08.046
There are cases...

10:08.120 --> 10:10.407
You know, cases
where there's no medical,

10:10.480 --> 10:12.528
no psychological explanation.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.648
Look, I never believed
in possession until this.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.368
Is Daniel your biological son?

10:27.080 --> 10:28.570
Of course he's ours.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.882
Do you see a physical
change in Daniel?

10:35.760 --> 10:36.841
Sometimes.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.251
Can you describe it?

10:39.040 --> 10:41.088
A change comes over his face,

10:41.200 --> 10:44.727
like there is somebody inside of
him that is trying to control him.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.723
Have you ever seen anyone
else change like this?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.086
No.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.648
Now there is something

10:50.720 --> 10:53.564
horrible happening
inside my son.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.843
So we know what we're
dealing with here, right?

10:58.920 --> 11:00.001
I don't know.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.684
He said he saw
something in Daniel.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.411
If Daniel were Wesen, then
the dad would have to be.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.088
Or the mom. Or both.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.323
At least one would
have to be, I think.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.131
All right, what if one is,
the other's hiding it?

11:12.200 --> 11:14.248
Oh, I think that'd be
hard to hide for long.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.651
MAN: (OVER PA) There is no
parking in taxi zones.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.086
(GREETING IN GERMAN)

11:55.160 --> 11:57.049
(SIGHS) Fine.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.402
Been a long time
since I've been back.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.245
And we're doing our best
that nobody finds out.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.800
I wouldn't want what happened to
your brother to happen to you.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.282
How's everything
been since his death?

12:09.360 --> 12:11.203
Nobody's very comfortable.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.484
When is our reunion?

12:15.320 --> 12:17.322
Not everyone's here yet.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.727
What about Frenay?

12:18.840 --> 12:21.320
He's coming.
So is Tavitian.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.810
What about Lucanus?

12:23.880 --> 12:25.723
Oh, they settled
their differences.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.723
Lucanus is dead.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.008
Tavitian's taken control of the
Ceux de la Resistance Nord,

12:32.080 --> 12:34.242
and united it with
his Resistencia Maquis.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.005
He's in control of
the entire South.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.886
That changes some alliances.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.365
Hopefully not ours.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.240
Where are you keeping me?

12:46.920 --> 12:48.490
Someplace you're
not going to like.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.244
So if one parent is Wesen
and the other one isn't,

13:00.320 --> 13:01.810
what would the child be?

13:02.440 --> 13:05.125
You mean a Wesen
and a Kehrseite?

13:05.200 --> 13:06.326
Yeah.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.282
So, I guess it's time

13:09.360 --> 13:12.284
for the whole birds
and the Bienen-Wesen talk.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.691
Okay.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.721
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:17.320 --> 13:20.529
If both parents are Wesen,
then the child will be, too.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.080
Or if one parent is Wesen
and the other is Kehrseite,

13:23.160 --> 13:25.970
then there's a 50/50 chance
that the child will be Wesen.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.963
Unless the Kehrseite
is a Kehrseite-Gentrager.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.644
Then you're definitely
getting a Wesen.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.326
Let's pretend I understood
what you just said.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.080
What if both parents are
Wesen, but different kinds?

13:36.600 --> 13:40.161
You mean like a Grundverschiedene
situation like us?

13:41.760 --> 13:44.081
Well, we don't mean to pry.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.571
Yeah, we do.

13:47.240 --> 13:50.005
Well, then you're
looking at a Vorherrscher.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.401
But...

we don't care.

You'll get used to the smell.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.290
I don't think so.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.885
Last time I was in
a place like this,

my mother and I were
running for our lives.

into the sewer,

many wars and revolutions.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.284

It was built in a time
when men were smaller.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.925
Pretty sure you'll fit.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.365
Pretty sure I don't want to.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.531
Not in that suit.

How long do we stay here?

15:24.520 --> 15:27.330
Until we are contacted
about the meeting.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.330

taught me, you know?

And before your
family killed him.

great pains to make sure

15:44.360 --> 15:49.366
every conceivable medical
or psychological explanation

15:49.440 --> 15:51.886
can be ruled out
before moving forward.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.804
Many more cases of
possession are turned away

15:54.880 --> 15:57.008
than are accepted by the church.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.922
Monsignor was certain on this.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.402
He wanted so
badly to help Daniel.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.891
What happened in that room?

16:10.920 --> 16:13.605
Monsignor began the exorcism.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.729
He commanded
the beast to come out.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.281
(CHANTING)

16:19.120 --> 16:20.121
(GROWLS)

16:24.280 --> 16:25.930
it all happened so fast.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.651
Daniel attacked us,

16:27.720 --> 16:29.609
but he cannot be blamed,
he's an innocent child.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.762
You did tie one of his arms.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.851
Did you anticipate violence?

16:35.880 --> 16:39.487
I'd started to hold him down when
the beast fought to control him.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.921
We were concerned that
he might injure himself.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.521
Did you see a physical
change in the boy?

16:47.920 --> 16:48.921
(GROWLS)

16:50.920 --> 16:54.561
What I saw was not
the face of Daniel.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.041
It was the face of a demon.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.250
So what are we dealing with?

17:22.319 --> 17:24.003
Is the kid Wesen, or is he,

17:24.079 --> 17:25.205
and I hesitate to say this,

17:25.280 --> 17:26.361
possessed by some demon?

17:26.480 --> 17:27.720
I don't think he's Wesen.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.370
Even if one parent was,
they would know

17:29.440 --> 17:31.010
and they wouldn't put
their child through this.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.081
So that leaves demon.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.161
I got nothing else.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.123
I wish you hadn't said that.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.241
(GROWLS)

18:01.720 --> 18:05.008
(SCREAMS) I saw it! I saw it!
Some kind of monster in that boy!

18:05.080 --> 18:08.766
HANK: Ma'am, I need you to
relax and just calm down.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.121
Breathe.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.605
Daniel.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.161
(GROWLING)

18:18.360 --> 18:19.805
What the hell is this?

18:20.640 --> 18:22.529
I don't know. Well, I
know what it looks like.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.965
How do we handle it?

18:24.080 --> 18:25.650
I think we just stay back.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.365
That was really weird.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.042
I think it reacts
to confrontation.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.884
I want to go home.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.010
We need to put
a guard on this room.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.286
Yeah.

18:45.760 --> 18:46.807
I need to see my patient.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.325
We need to talk.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.640
That boy is
experiencing something

18:49.720 --> 18:52.041
that I don't think anybody
is capable of explaining.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.242
I don't believe any of that.
Get out of my way.

18:54.360 --> 18:58.490
If you provoke that boy, you
will be a believer real quick.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.601
Anybody who enters that room is
at risk of physical violence.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.170
We've already got a dead priest

19:03.240 --> 19:04.605
and an injured seminary student.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.284
Then what do you
expect us to do?

19:06.840 --> 19:08.285
Nothing that could be
perceived as a threat.

19:08.360 --> 19:09.691
No blood, no tests.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.001
Just food and observation.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.844
We have a unit on the way.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.002
What am I supposed
to tell my staff?

19:16.200 --> 19:17.929
Tell them you don't
want them to get hurt.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.204
I'll give you 24 hours.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.210
If he's that dangerous, I want
him out of this hospital.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.606
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

19:44.440 --> 19:46.841
Hello?
MAN: Ada/ind Schade?

19:46.920 --> 19:48.126
Yes.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.249
Your presence is requested
this evening at the house.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.322
May I ask what this is about?

19:54.400 --> 19:55.606
We'll send a car.

19:55.680 --> 19:56.681
(HANGS UP)

19:59.520 --> 20:01.045
MONROE: You sure
the parents aren't Wesen?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.884
I'm not sure of anything.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.962
I just haven't seen any
indication that they are.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.281
And this is different than
anything I've ever seen.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.805
You mean he didn't Woge?

20:08.880 --> 20:11.804
No, this is more
like a battle within.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.644
It's classic devil worship
as far as I'm concerned,

20:13.720 --> 20:15.609
but we're hoping you have
another explanation.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.401
What?

20:21.320 --> 20:22.367
(SIGHS)

20:22.440 --> 20:23.965
I kind of thought...

20:24.040 --> 20:26.122
I mean, they're myths, right?

20:26.440 --> 20:27.680
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.764
I think I am.
Grausens, right?

20:30.880 --> 20:32.211
That's what it sounds like.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.486
Is that a Wesen?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.645
Not really.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.083
Every generation has heard
stories about Grausens.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.286
They go way back.

20:41.360 --> 20:44.807
They used to think they were a Wesen
spirit that would invade a child.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.405
But never a Wesen child.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.005
Kehrseite kids only.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.242
But the thinking has
changed since medicine

20:50.320 --> 20:51.685
and science has advanced.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.131
Now, some believe
it's a mutation.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.606
So which is it?

20:56.680 --> 20:58.921
Nick, these are incredibly
rare occurrences.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.760
I mean...
ROSALEE: It doesn't really matter

21:00.800 --> 21:02.962
because they've always been
dealt with the same way.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.201
How?

21:06.560 --> 21:08.210
They would disappear.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.690
The Wesen Council is responsible
for dealing with them.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.604
Sometime in the 1600s,

21:15.680 --> 21:19.162
the Council communicated for the
first time with Royals and Grimms.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.130
They forged an alliance. For
the safety of all of them.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.522
Supposedly, Grausens,
if left to grow to maturity,

21:25.600 --> 21:28.080
become some of the world's
most notorious psychopaths,

21:28.160 --> 21:31.004
wreaking havoc on like
whole continents sometimes.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.841
Historically, Wesen were to blame
for what Grausens have done.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.570
That's why the Council steps in.

21:36.640 --> 21:37.766
Who is this Council anyway?

21:37.840 --> 21:39.205
They enforce Wesen law.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.931
You guys have your own laws?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.525
On, baby.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.609
If this is indeed a Grausen, we have
no choice but to inform the Council.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.967
Inform them means what?
Daniel disappears?

21:50.040 --> 21:51.166
MONROE: Basically.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.049
Yeah. It's a death
sentence for the kid.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.202
It's a death sentence
for us if we don't.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.409
How do we even
know he is Grausen?

21:57.480 --> 21:58.641
The law is clear.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.690
Even if it's a possibility,
we have to inform the Council.

22:01.760 --> 22:04.331
That's why we shouldn't even
be having this conversation.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.526
Now you tell us?
MONROE: Well, look.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.443
If we knew you were gonna
talk about Grausens,

22:07.520 --> 22:10.171
we would've said
"Don't talk about Grausens."

22:10.240 --> 22:12.800
We're not worried about the Council,
we're worried about the kid.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.769
Now we get to worry about both.

22:16.760 --> 22:17.921
Thanks.

22:21.760 --> 22:24.001
Can't we just let Nick run with this?
(DOOR CLOSES)

22:24.120 --> 22:25.929
If they found out
that we didn't report it,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.367
plus we made an
agreement with a Grimm

22:28.440 --> 22:29.601
behind their back...

22:33.440 --> 22:34.640
Then I guess it's just a matter

22:34.680 --> 22:36.728
Of who goes to
whose funeral first.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.805
Well, I'm not
going to your funeral.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.291
I have to tell them.

22:50.360 --> 22:51.361

22:51.440 --> 22:52.521
DE GROOT: Come in.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.404
I got here as soon as I could.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.201
Good. You'll be leaving
as soon as you can.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.690
We've had the reports
of the possession of a child.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.085
Grausen.
Hmm.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.207
What do we know?

23:05.320 --> 23:06.446
Not much, I'm afraid.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.851
A priest is dead.

23:07.920 --> 23:11.447
And the child, a nine-year-old
boy, is in hospital.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.802
Do you accept responsibility
for what has to happen?

23:18.040 --> 23:19.326
Yes.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.163
NICK: This entry's from 1520.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.004
There's more from 1683.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.730
1741,1804.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.763
In each case, the Grimm thought
that they were going in

23:31.840 --> 23:33.410
dealing with the Wesen.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.126
But it turned out
to be a Grausen.

23:36.200 --> 23:40.489
That was their theory,
or belief, or myth.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.449
Still, there's something
going on inside this kid.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.965
I just can't figure it out.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.884
Listen to this. 1920.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.880
"After my encounter with what I
now conclude to be a Grausen,

23:51.960 --> 23:54.611
"I'm left with one
undeniable certainty.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.923
"Grausens are not the province
of Grimms, not being Wesen.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.530
"I've therefore
informed the Council

23:59.600 --> 24:01.120
"as my ancestors
have done in the past.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.128
"But I am left with
a nagging question.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.965
"I don't believe this is possession
by any sort of devil or demon.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.725
"I believe it is a disease,
of what manner I know not,

24:08.840 --> 24:10.968
"nor how it is
transmitted."

24:11.040 --> 24:12.963
Does this make sense,
based on what you've seen?

24:13.040 --> 24:15.520
Well, at the hospital, they said his
white blood cell count was high

24:15.640 --> 24:17.290
and his immune
system was stressed.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.249
Which suggests
infectious disease.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.289
How long did the parents say
this has all been going on?

24:22.360 --> 24:24.283
About a year. So what
happened a year ago?

24:24.400 --> 24:25.845
I don't know.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.966
If it is a disease,

24:28.040 --> 24:29.929
it could've been transmitted
sometime before that,

24:30.000 --> 24:31.604
depending on
the incubation period.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.365
Well, what disease would
cause this kind of behavior?

24:34.440 --> 24:37.489
There are all kinds of
pathogens, viral and bacterial,

24:37.560 --> 24:39.449
that could interact with
the central nervous system

24:39.520 --> 24:42.091
or older portions of the
brain that control behavior.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.208
And new pathogens are
discovered all the time.

24:44.280 --> 24:45.884
This has a long history.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.042
But apparently not very common.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.691
Which could explain why
it's not well-understood.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.165
I think you need to
talk to the parents

24:52.240 --> 24:54.447
and figure out exactly
what happened a year ago.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.690
I'm gonna talk to the
parents about pathogens

24:57.760 --> 24:59.250
and incubation periods?

24:59.720 --> 25:01.324

who can get me in to see my son.

26:08.640 --> 26:09.926
Excuse me.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.525
There is a policeman
that is standing in front

of our son's room, and
he is not letting us in.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.091
We're very sorry, sir.
We can't take any chances

26:15.160 --> 26:16.525
on anybody else getting hurt.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.886
They're not helping him here.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.485
We don't know if they can.

26:19.560 --> 26:22.803
This is Juliette Silverton. She's
been working with me on the case.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.086
I'm sorry, but we're
gonna have to ask

26:24.160 --> 26:25.764
you guys just
a few more questions.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.968
More questions is
not gonna help our son!

26:28.040 --> 26:30.441
We need to know exactly
what happened a year ago

26:30.520 --> 26:33.046
when you first started noticing
a change in Daniel's behavior.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.607
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.125
This... Look, this all
came out of nowhere,

26:37.240 --> 26:38.651
and it's just
kept getting worse.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.451
What about before that,
say, a month or two?

26:42.320 --> 26:43.526
Well, we were on vacation.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.126
Where did you go?

26:45.200 --> 26:48.283
Egypt. Israel, Jordan,
with a tour group.

26:48.720 --> 26:49.800
How was Daniel on that trip?

26:49.840 --> 26:50.841
He was fine.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.325
But no...
He was... He was fine.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.165
No, he got the flu. He was
sick for about three days.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.130
They gave him antibiotics
and then he was fine.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.282
Did they happen to do
anything like a culture?

27:00.360 --> 27:01.964
No, they just
said it was the flu,

27:02.040 --> 27:03.804
and that he could've
gotten it anywhere.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.291
He was swimming in
the Jordan River,

27:05.360 --> 27:07.124
we were in the Dead Sea,
we were hiking...

27:07.200 --> 27:08.690
I'm sorry. I just
don't see what this could

27:08.760 --> 27:09.966
possibly have to
do with anything.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.441
We don't know. We're just
running down all leads.

27:12.520 --> 27:14.124
When can we see our son?

27:15.640 --> 27:16.926
Let me check.

So it's possible
that he could've been

27:21.520 --> 27:22.885
infected while
they were on vacation.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.689
Whenever any
pathogen is introduced,

27:24.760 --> 27:26.888
the body has an
immunological response.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.525
Must be something pretty exotic

27:29.600 --> 27:31.250
to have been
missed by the doctors.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.446
Any problems?

27:34.720 --> 27:36.245
No, sir. It's been quiet.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.646
Nobody in or out?

27:37.760 --> 27:40.240

been kind of staying away.

He looks so young.

27:42.480 --> 27:43.766
Yeah.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.130
That's a weird place
to put your shoes.

27:53.240 --> 27:54.526
What?

27:54.640 --> 27:56.244
You put your
shoes in the drawer.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.761
Oh.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.723
You know, I don't really
think that Daniel's behavior

28:02.800 --> 28:05.610
is caused by anything
viral or bacterial.

28:05.680 --> 28:09.446
It would have to have a more
direct impact on behavior.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.560
You know, a colleague
of mine did a case study

28:11.600 --> 28:13.568
while I was in vet school about
a group of thoroughbreds

28:13.640 --> 28:15.369
that were flown
to Dubai to race,

28:15.440 --> 28:17.886
and there was a storm that
forced their transport plane

28:17.960 --> 28:19.564
to layover in Jordan.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.369
By the time the horses
returned to the U.S.,

28:21.440 --> 28:23.761
they were exhibiting extremely
aggressive behavior.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.729
Okay, Jordan is
where Daniel was.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.121
Well, she argued that the
horses should be saved,

28:28.360 --> 28:32.365
that their behavior was caused by a
protozoa, similar to toxoplasmosis,

28:32.480 --> 28:34.721
and that if she could just
kill the parasite within

28:34.800 --> 28:36.404
the horses would
return to normal.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.481
Did it work?

28:37.560 --> 28:40.962
No, they destroyed the horses
before they could be treated.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.530
Well, that seems to be
the standard treatment

28:42.600 --> 28:44.568
for anything they can't explain.

This is what I have to do.

29:56.280 --> 29:58.851
People wouldn't necessarily
have understood the concept

29:58.920 --> 30:01.685
of a parasite living within the
body hundreds of years ago.

And if it manifested
itself physically

30:03.560 --> 30:06.484
and was interpreted as
possession by the devil,

then, yeah, you can kind of understand
everybody's rush to judgment.

that there's a way

out of Daniel?

30:13.280 --> 30:16.409
No, I'm saying we have to
kill the protozoa in Daniel.

are we gonna do that?

What?

32:47.680 --> 32:48.966
It's possible that when
you were on vacation

32:49.040 --> 32:51.327
and Daniel became ill,
it wasn't the flu.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.641
No, it was the flu.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.484

he had flu symptoms.

and you didn't.

But now you're here

We think it could be a very
rare protozoa, like a parasite.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.804
It could've been in the water
when he went swimming.

is true, could it be treated?

Yeah.

Then what happens if the

you talking about?

temperature range.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.726

Those are the medical reports run on
Daniel Keary after we took him in.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.726
What does this prove?

40:01.120 --> 40:02.929
That Daniel was
infected by a parasite

40:03.280 --> 40:06.409
that caused him to be what you
and the Council call a Grausen.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.642
It's not possession by demon,

40:08.760 --> 40:11.445
it's not mutation,
and Daniel has been cured.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.165
You're a Grimm.
You should know better.

40:19.240 --> 40:20.844
I need to see the boy.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.206
No, you don't.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.605
And you need to
take my word for it,

40:25.680 --> 40:27.967
because of what my ancestors
and the Council agreed to

40:28.040 --> 40:30.361
at the Charter of
Wittenberg in 1682.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.487
Take the report
with you when you go.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.210
I want the Council to read it.

40:36.560 --> 40:37.766
You're letting me go.

40:40.640 --> 40:43.769
I like to think we live
in an enlightened age,

40:43.840 --> 40:46.286
where fear does
not drive belief.

40:47.560 --> 40:50.006
That's the truth
behind the fear.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.771
Fear is not an easy
thing to change.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.691
Try.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.722
Do we believe this report?

41:09.680 --> 41:12.490
Well, he didn't
have to let me go.

41:13.560 --> 41:19.203

about this Grimm are true.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.244
