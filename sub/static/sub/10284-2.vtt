01:01.400 --> 01:02.293
Mom!

01:16.142 --> 01:19.496
I'm losing it. I don't...
I can't even drive.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.219
You're the only person
I could think of to call.

01:26.976 --> 01:31.068
I don't know. I'm, uh... somewhere...
close to Waukegan.

01:31.483 --> 01:35.798
There's a Phillip's Diner and,
um, a gas station.

01:36.465 --> 01:37.436
Yeah.

01:38.448 --> 01:39.911
Okay, thanks.

01:41.703 --> 01:43.512
Hurry up, okay?

01:57.500 --> 01:59.720
All preemies have
the same five problems--

01:59.726 --> 02:04.370
infection, hypotension, hypoglycemia,
tachypnea, cyanosis.

02:04.754 --> 02:07.002
Your guy has four out of five.

02:07.091 --> 02:09.960
White count's up.
He's on dopa and dobutamine,

02:09.960 --> 02:12.542
and we're needing higher pressures
to ventilate.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.610
How high?

02:14.088 --> 02:15.750
PIPs at 32.

02:15.757 --> 02:18.183
You're pummeling his lungs.
He's going to get BPD.

02:18.707 --> 02:21.661
Abby, Luka, listen to me.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.872
It's hard enough being
a parent in here.

02:23.875 --> 02:27.392
You're going to have to trust me
to do what's best for your son.

02:29.486 --> 02:30.533
Abby?

02:31.108 --> 02:32.350
Any questions?

02:33.005 --> 02:34.001
No.

02:34.848 --> 02:36.510
I've been here before.

02:51.476 --> 02:53.552
Do you want me to wheel you back
to your room?

02:55.408 --> 02:57.153
You shouldn't stay out of bed
that long.

02:57.157 --> 02:59.892
You know, I've given that watch
and wait speech about a hundred times,

02:59.898 --> 03:01.683
and never realized what
a load of crap it is.

03:01.686 --> 03:03.583
Well, it's just the reality.

03:06.268 --> 03:07.331
And I can't shut my brain off.

03:07.336 --> 03:11.473
I keep thinking why is the dopa
at 17 and not 20,

03:11.475 --> 03:13.991
and did they check
the tube position and...

03:16.806 --> 03:18.471
I can't see his eyes.

03:20.018 --> 03:21.760
I need to know what color they are.

03:22.745 --> 03:23.751
They're blue.

03:32.006 --> 03:33.963
Uh, Neela asked me...

03:33.966 --> 03:35.191
She wants to come and visit.

03:35.197 --> 03:37.580
I don't want any visitors.
I don't want to see anybody.

03:37.628 --> 03:39.410
Abby! Abby!

03:39.418 --> 03:42.052
Abby! Oh, thank God.

03:42.607 --> 03:45.610
Oh, I came as soon as I heard.

03:58.006 --> 04:00.501
- You're not wrong.
- They're going to send me to jail.

04:02.685 --> 04:05.640
For what, killing a scumbag?
He's better off dead.

04:07.488 --> 04:10.313
I was in the car.
I could have driven away.

04:11.206 --> 04:13.131
I went back to kill him.

04:13.136 --> 04:15.220
That's the last time
you're ever going to say that.

04:15.647 --> 04:16.660
You hear me?

04:16.666 --> 04:18.603
There's only two people
who know it here...

04:19.107 --> 04:20.202
You and me.

04:20.495 --> 04:22.103
You fill out a rape report.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.083
You tell the cops you shot him
in self-defense.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.101
- You think that'll work?
- That's what happened.

04:32.507 --> 04:33.962
Do you understand?

04:36.107 --> 04:37.502
It's what happened.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.701
Serial crits and foot pulses Q
30 minutes.

04:44.705 --> 04:46.352
Hey, any word on Sam?

04:46.655 --> 04:48.302
The police are still looking for her.

04:48.307 --> 04:49.922
You want the walls eggshell or white?

04:49.925 --> 04:52.223
Do I look like Martha Stewart
or the Chief of Staff?

04:52.258 --> 04:54.182
- I got real work to do.
- What's with her?

04:54.187 --> 04:56.742
I guess she has to pay for the repairs
out of her Christmas bonus.

04:56.746 --> 04:58.152
- Oh, Ray.
- Mm-hmm?

04:58.576 --> 04:59.673
Is this your writing?

04:59.778 --> 05:02.112
Yeah, linebacker from Northwestern,
looks like a rotator cuff.

05:02.118 --> 05:04.793
Come on, man, no MRIs if you've got
a freakin' metal plate in your leg.

05:04.795 --> 05:06.402
The techs going to go over that.

05:06.668 --> 05:08.831
You're lucky I caught this,
or it would have been a mess.

05:08.937 --> 05:10.942
I better enjoy myself
the next few weeks,

05:10.946 --> 05:12.963
because you're going to be
a pain in the ass attending.

05:19.506 --> 05:22.050
- Hey.
- Hey. What time is it?

05:22.135 --> 05:24.252
It's time to go home.
You've been here all night.

05:24.697 --> 05:28.042
- I should go and check on Abby.
- No, you should go and get some rest.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.302
Gallant's parents will probably want
to see you today.

05:30.307 --> 05:32.451
No, I'm not going over there.

05:32.858 --> 05:34.272
Neela, go home.

05:39.008 --> 05:42.540
Dopa's at 17, mean's hanging around 25,

05:42.548 --> 05:45.403
two out of six systolic
ejection murmur on exam.

05:45.405 --> 05:47.493
- Translate into English, please?
- Hold on, wait, hold, wait.

05:47.498 --> 05:48.670
There's a murmur?

05:48.697 --> 05:50.701
Get the echo, let's take a look.

05:50.708 --> 05:53.203
- I don't understand any of this.
- It's okay, I'll explain it to you later.

05:53.217 --> 05:55.991
Your daughter was a star student
when she was here.

05:56.118 --> 05:58.171
Really.
She never gives herself any credit.

05:58.178 --> 06:00.232
Well, the good ones never do.

06:01.268 --> 06:02.711
Is that the heart?

06:04.408 --> 06:07.822
Oh, my gosh, look at that.
It's just beating away, isn't it?

06:08.057 --> 06:09.753
- I didn't tell her to come.
 -It's okay.

06:09.758 --> 06:10.483
- Isn't that amazing?
- Are you sure?

06:10.485 --> 06:13.352
- How you can see that?
- I'm sure. She's on her meds.

06:14.138 --> 06:15.423
- Neela.
- Hi.

06:16.467 --> 06:19.733
I know you can't eat in here, but maybe
you can take a break in the hall?

06:20.805 --> 06:21.902
How's he doing?

06:21.907 --> 06:22.920
We don't know.

06:22.926 --> 06:24.171
- What about you?
- I'm okay.

06:24.177 --> 06:26.691
You can see all of the different ventricles
and things of the heart right here?

06:26.695 --> 06:28.391
That is just astonishing.

06:28.397 --> 06:30.572
- Who's that?
 -My mother.

06:30.577 --> 06:31.961
- We never had things like this...
- Mom!

06:31.968 --> 06:32.672
Yeah?

06:32.677 --> 06:34.911
Um, you want to meet my friend?

06:35.638 --> 06:36.392
Hi.

06:36.658 --> 06:37.621
Maggie Wyzenski.

06:37.627 --> 06:39.442
Neela Rasgotra.
I've heard a lot about you.

06:39.447 --> 06:42.531
Mostly right to left, T-R jet's 3.4.

06:42.538 --> 06:43.482
What are T-R jets?

06:43.486 --> 06:45.333
It's blood flowing the wrong way
through the heart.

06:45.335 --> 06:47.440
Couldn't it just be the pulmonary
pressures haven't dropped yet?

06:47.445 --> 06:49.172
Probably elevated from the RDS.

06:49.177 --> 06:50.411
Wait a minute. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

06:50.415 --> 06:52.383
You're saying there's something wrong
with the baby's heart?

06:52.386 --> 06:53.520
We don't know.

06:53.527 --> 06:55.560
Well, what do you mean?
You-you-you're going to fix it.

06:55.568 --> 06:58.462
Well, we can't just fix it.
He's premature.

06:58.528 --> 07:00.652
He's going to be here for weeks.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.690
All right, then... we'll just wait.

07:08.008 --> 07:08.982
It's all right.

07:09.427 --> 07:10.692
We'll just wait.

07:13.507 --> 07:17.683
James Clivus, 39, fell 20 feet scaling
Tribune Tower.

07:17.685 --> 07:19.450
Apparently he gets better
reception up there.

07:19.455 --> 07:21.700
- Cell phones are just a cover.
- What's with the tinfoil?

07:21.726 --> 07:24.773
Well, it amplifies frequency bands
allocated to the U.S. government.

07:24.776 --> 07:28.042
The Pentagon says it's for communication
with satellites, but that's a lie.

07:28.108 --> 07:30.582
- Vitals?
- Distal deformity of the right LE.

07:30.607 --> 07:32.603
Hey, Mayday, heard about yesterday.

07:32.656 --> 07:34.150
Glad to see you're okay.

07:34.726 --> 07:35.802
Yeah.

07:38.806 --> 07:39.930
What's with her?

07:40.908 --> 07:41.622
What?

07:41.626 --> 07:43.312
Her husband was killed in Iraq.

07:43.676 --> 07:45.063
Are you kidding me?

07:45.227 --> 07:46.522
You think we'd joke about that?

07:46.527 --> 07:48.800
We've ceded control
to the search engines!

07:49.007 --> 07:50.503
- I got to go!
- Calm down!

07:50.505 --> 07:51.692
- Hey, hey!
- I've got to go!

07:51.696 --> 07:53.112
Hey, you've got to let us
check you out!

07:53.116 --> 07:54.963
Don't think I don't know
what you mean by that!

07:54.965 --> 07:56.590
Hey, there's Sam.

07:57.556 --> 07:59.723
- You got this?
- Yeah, I got it.

08:01.707 --> 08:04.290
- Hey, honey, are you all right?
- Oh, my gosh.

08:07.455 --> 08:09.210
How did you, how did you get here?

08:09.215 --> 08:11.061
A friend dropped me off.

08:13.047 --> 08:14.973
I need a rape exam.

08:23.008 --> 08:24.901
So what do you call that thing again?

08:25.437 --> 08:26.390
It's a PICC line.

08:26.394 --> 08:30.552
It allows us to give nutrition and
medicines without sticking the baby.

08:30.601 --> 08:32.390
It's kinking or something.

08:32.390 --> 08:34.642
Oh, oh, wait, maybe you should let
Dr. Raab do that.

08:34.649 --> 08:37.563
Uh, will you step back, please?
You're just making it harder for him.

08:37.567 --> 08:38.591
It's okay, you're doing fine.

08:38.597 --> 08:40.441
You don't want students working
on your son.

08:40.446 --> 08:42.251
He's a resident, not a student.

08:43.238 --> 08:44.293
What's that?

08:45.708 --> 08:48.923
PVCs. It's the tip of
the catheter tickling the heart.

08:49.437 --> 08:52.543
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry,
but you pulled back the line, right?

08:52.788 --> 08:54.841
Of course he did, Abby.

08:54.847 --> 08:56.103
Pulled back the line.

08:56.108 --> 08:59.062
Uh, all right, 2:37...

08:59.066 --> 09:01.383
- PVCs...
- What's the deal with the notes?

09:01.385 --> 09:04.163
Well, I'm writing everything down
so I can look it up later on.

09:04.165 --> 09:06.863
Last night I was reading
about smoking and prematurity.

09:06.868 --> 09:08.690
- Do you think...
- I quit two years ago.

09:08.696 --> 09:11.283
Well, I know you did, but, Abby,
you work so hard...

09:11.285 --> 09:14.662
- and stress can definitely be a factor...
- Are you blaming this on me?

09:14.667 --> 09:17.170
No, of course I'm not blaming you.
I'm not blaming anyone.

09:17.177 --> 09:19.521
I just... my grandson is on a...
on a...

09:19.527 --> 09:20.363
Ventilator.

09:20.367 --> 09:22.850
Ventilator, and-and-and
I need to understand...

09:22.858 --> 09:26.131
Maggie, she fell.
People were shooting and she fell, okay?

09:26.777 --> 09:27.792
Look.

09:27.795 --> 09:33.113
You can ask yourselves why all day long,
but in the end, the answer doesn't matter.

09:33.536 --> 09:34.710
Miss Lockhart?

09:35.176 --> 09:35.912
Yeah?

09:35.916 --> 09:38.982
Uh, we're about to start
a lactation seminar in the pump room.

09:41.127 --> 09:44.001
Uh, if it's not a good time...

09:44.008 --> 09:46.122
No, sounds great.

09:46.328 --> 09:48.791
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you.

09:48.806 --> 09:50.712
Great. Okay.

09:50.718 --> 09:52.140
Here we go.

09:52.598 --> 09:53.800
Great.

10:05.805 --> 10:06.822
Hey, Joe.

10:27.645 --> 10:31.603
These go between the boob and the tube,
know what I mean?

10:31.605 --> 10:34.190
Mm-hmm, it's pretty self-explanatory.

10:34.417 --> 10:36.610
- You seem hesitant.
 -She is.

10:37.417 --> 10:40.572
-Breast milk is best for babies.
- Oh, she knows that, she's a doctor.

10:40.608 --> 10:43.553
I think I just need a little privacy.

10:44.706 --> 10:46.840
Okay, I'll get you a screen.

10:48.008 --> 10:49.801
- She seems nice.
- Yeah.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.812
Um... you, too.

10:56.448 --> 10:57.430
What?

10:58.325 --> 10:59.520
I need you to...

11:00.577 --> 11:02.613
Oh, Abby, I've been through
all of this before.

11:02.615 --> 11:03.711
- I don't think so.
- Yes.

11:03.718 --> 11:07.552
No, have you had a C-section,
a hysterectomy and a premature baby?

11:07.695 --> 11:10.161
- No, I-I haven't but...
- I didn't think so.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.701
Abby, look, I can...

11:11.708 --> 11:13.460
Look, I just...
I'll meet you outside.

11:14.206 --> 11:15.431
I think that you...

11:15.855 --> 11:17.350
I would like to meet you outside.

11:17.355 --> 11:18.463
All right.

11:18.467 --> 11:19.490
Fine.

11:19.496 --> 11:21.581
- Fine, I'll meet you outside.
- Thanks.

11:28.656 --> 11:30.750
They have a boy or a girl?

11:31.377 --> 11:32.421
A boy.

11:32.955 --> 11:34.540
He's in the NICU.

11:36.618 --> 11:37.861
What about Jerry?

11:38.305 --> 11:41.343
He was shot to the chest,
but he's pulling through.

11:41.965 --> 11:46.210
Okay, you'll feel a little pressure
while I get the cultures.

11:48.497 --> 11:52.980
Haleh, send off HIV
and hepatitis titers.

11:52.988 --> 11:54.110
No problem.

11:54.706 --> 11:56.662
Sam, can I get you some water?

11:57.185 --> 11:59.473
Um, I'm okay, thanks, Haleh.

12:02.795 --> 12:07.533
You know, I knew that he stole TVs
and video equipment, but I just...

12:08.325 --> 12:11.220
I never thought he'd be capable
of anything like this.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.110
It's not your fault.

12:14.055 --> 12:15.632
Yeah, it feels like it.

12:15.906 --> 12:17.403
Well, it's not.

12:19.548 --> 12:21.593
Do you know where Steve
and the others are?

12:21.597 --> 12:23.023
Did they catch them?

12:24.668 --> 12:25.631
They're dead.

12:28.006 --> 12:29.012
All of them?

12:30.418 --> 12:31.872
All of them.

12:43.807 --> 12:46.260
Not a good place to take a nap out here,
buddy-- you could drown.

12:46.906 --> 12:49.392
Track marks everywhere.
No way we're getting a line in.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.771
I'll throw in an EJ.

12:51.055 --> 12:51.940
Yeah, right.

12:51.948 --> 12:55.122
Hey, I just spent a month in the ICU,
I could do it in my sleep.

12:55.358 --> 12:58.210
Looks like you got a bad batch of heroin
there, knocked you on your ass.

12:58.216 --> 13:00.653
- I hate when that happens, don't you?
- That's not funny, man.

13:00.657 --> 13:01.812
Say, "Ah."

13:04.646 --> 13:06.452
- What the hell is that?
 -Narcan.

13:06.565 --> 13:07.612
Sublingual?

13:07.616 --> 13:09.862
- Are we authorized for that?
- What? I can't hear you.

13:09.867 --> 13:11.372
That's not in our scope, man.

13:11.376 --> 13:13.162
I've got the base on the line. Ho!

13:13.665 --> 13:15.361
County General on alpha one, go ahead.

13:15.368 --> 13:17.410
- Electrocuted juggler,
- Teenage male, probably overdose.

13:17.416 --> 13:19.730
self-inflicted toe amputation,
kerosene ingestion...

13:19.736 --> 13:21.091
What-what is this?

13:21.098 --> 13:23.113
People will do anything
to stay out of the rain.

13:23.116 --> 13:25.582
We've got three near-drownings
from a flooded homeless shelter

13:25.588 --> 13:27.413
- and this board hasn't changed in over an hour.
- Perfusion sucks, no access. I was thinking an EJ.

13:27.417 --> 13:29.590
No, no, no, Gates,
you cannot put in an EJ.

13:29.597 --> 13:30.202
Why not?

13:30.208 --> 13:32.031
Because it's out of your scope
of practice, that's why.

13:32.035 --> 13:33.592
- We're ten minutes out.
- Yeah, fine, I'll see you then.

13:33.596 --> 13:34.513
What was that?

13:34.516 --> 13:37.863
Unresponsive overdose ten minutes out
with one cocky-ass paramedic.

13:37.865 --> 13:40.093
- ER said okay on the EJ.
- They did?

13:40.095 --> 13:40.910
Yeah.

13:40.918 --> 13:42.522
Hey, they know me there, they trust me.

13:42.527 --> 13:43.893
Unlike my partner.

13:43.897 --> 13:47.080
Look, if you're lying, I promise you,
I'll sell you out.

13:51.508 --> 13:52.491
How's my boy?

13:52.497 --> 13:53.493
He's hanging in there.

13:53.498 --> 13:57.890
I've been reading to him all morning and
I swear to you he recognizes my voice.

13:58.347 --> 14:01.293
The vent wean isn't working,
they had to crank the O2 up to 70.

14:01.295 --> 14:03.360
Take that coat off, Dr. Kovac.

14:03.466 --> 14:06.563
We don't need the nasty ER
bugs in the NICU.

14:06.567 --> 14:07.530
I'm sorry.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.301
Have you two made a decision about
the fludrozalone trial yet?

14:11.307 --> 14:12.172
- Yeah.
- No.

14:12.178 --> 14:14.722
Flu... Fludro... flu...
What is it?

14:14.726 --> 14:15.613
Fludrozalone.

14:15.617 --> 14:19.511
It's a new drug they're studying for use
in persistent hypotension.

14:19.516 --> 14:22.940
Baby Joe is over 1,500 grams.
He's a perfect fit...

14:22.947 --> 14:25.310
Perfect fit... ..for your trial--
we know, we know.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.473
We're still...
We're still making a decision.

14:27.478 --> 14:30.413
Spontaneous intestinal perfs, bleeding,
neurodevelopmental delays...

14:30.415 --> 14:31.822
Theoretical risk, Abby.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.743
I don't want to subject our child
to an experimental protocol

14:34.748 --> 14:35.900
when we haven't exhausted
all of the standard...

14:35.906 --> 14:38.580
Because he still doesn't have
an adequate blood pressure.

14:38.588 --> 14:41.740
Yes, but why just dopamine?
Why not dobutamine and-and an epi infusion?

14:41.748 --> 14:43.133
Don't micromanage.

14:43.158 --> 14:44.113
- Don't you...
- I won't.

14:44.118 --> 14:44.882
- Don't.
- Okay.

14:44.888 --> 14:47.593
Okay, why don't I just leave
the consent form,

14:47.598 --> 14:50.700
just in case you change your mind?
Excuse me.

14:54.005 --> 14:56.500
She's just trying to give him
the best possible chance.

14:56.506 --> 14:59.032
From the second we walked in here
she's been pushing this trial.

14:59.036 --> 15:00.743
- Come on, Abby, that's ridiculous.
- Is it?

15:00.748 --> 15:02.840
Why do you always have to assume
the worst about people?

15:02.846 --> 15:04.953
It's not about me being negative.
It's... I-I'm...

15:04.957 --> 15:08.052
You need to pay attention and wake up.
This is our baby.

15:15.506 --> 15:16.670
Can you believe him?

15:18.775 --> 15:20.340
I think... I think he's right.

15:21.576 --> 15:23.080
You don't really know the first thing
about it, so...

15:23.087 --> 15:25.482
Abby, maybe this new drug would turn
everything around.

15:25.485 --> 15:27.903
I know it's tough,
but I think we have to consider it.

15:27.905 --> 15:30.813
Now sometimes you just have to use
your instincts about these things.

15:30.816 --> 15:33.553
Shut up. Shut up!
Please, please, just shut up.

15:35.805 --> 15:37.472
You know, I-I didn't ask you
to come here.

15:37.475 --> 15:39.072
I didn't ask you to be involved.

15:39.236 --> 15:41.160
Maybe you should just leave.

15:43.887 --> 15:44.802
Okay.

15:57.006 --> 15:59.771
Hey, Dori, can you find out
when the lab runs pertussis assays?

15:59.776 --> 16:01.802
Every day but Tuesday and Sunday.

16:01.807 --> 16:04.100
Whew, what did you do, mug a pimp?

16:04.608 --> 16:06.100
Yeah, your dad says hi.

16:06.108 --> 16:08.073
How are you all surviving without me?

16:08.075 --> 16:10.551
Just fine, hard as it is to believe.

16:10.557 --> 16:13.691
I got six hospitals to add Maxanoxx
to their formulary

16:13.696 --> 16:16.251
and now they're sending me to Vegas
for the weekend.

16:16.255 --> 16:18.820
- Vegas, sweet.
- Hey, put a bet down for me.

16:19.187 --> 16:22.223
Hey, Pratt, can you get a consent
for the lid-lag sedation?

16:22.227 --> 16:22.771
Sure.

16:22.776 --> 16:25.473
Not until you sign the discharge
for Gonorrhea Grandma.

16:25.507 --> 16:27.401
- Right.
- Need any help?

16:27.406 --> 16:29.991
It's just the usual mess,
nothing I can't handle.

16:31.195 --> 16:34.033
Okay, I don't just mean today. I...

16:34.576 --> 16:35.970
I want my job back.

16:35.976 --> 16:37.251
What happened to Vegas?

16:37.656 --> 16:38.502
Vegas?

16:38.805 --> 16:40.021
Do I look like Vegas?

16:40.477 --> 16:41.383
Kinda.

16:41.508 --> 16:43.123
I hate Vegas.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.901
Where's Weaver?
She's been ignoring my calls.

16:44.907 --> 16:47.180
She's busy with some admin crap.

16:47.347 --> 16:50.631
19-year-old male found down in an alley,
probable overdose.

16:50.637 --> 16:51.303
What do we got?

16:51.307 --> 16:54.891
Pulse 84, systolic 86
after a liter into the EJ.

16:54.896 --> 16:57.091
EJ? I told you not to do that.

16:57.096 --> 16:59.040
- You're dead.
- Aw, come on, it's flowing great.

16:59.048 --> 17:00.921
- You ought to thank me.
- No, I ought to report you!

17:00.927 --> 17:03.910
Dr. Kovac was running the floor
when Clemente had his meltdown.

17:03.918 --> 17:04.830
Yes, he was.

17:04.837 --> 17:06.781
And he was here the day that Clemente
and his girlfriend

17:06.788 --> 17:08.619
came in with multiple gunshot wounds?

17:08.627 --> 17:11.231
Um, I believe so, I'd have
to check the schedule.

17:11.237 --> 17:12.202
Yeah, he was.

17:12.204 --> 17:15.182
And he was there the day that he signed
off on the diabetic whose family

17:15.186 --> 17:18.092
is now bringing a multi-million dollar
lawsuit against us.

17:18.095 --> 17:19.423
Donald, where you going with this?

17:19.426 --> 17:24.162
I've drawn up a press release
announcing Dr. Kovac's dismissal.

17:24.228 --> 17:25.461
You're firing him?

17:25.465 --> 17:27.251
There was negligent management here.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.680
Shouldn't we give him a chance
to defend himself?

17:29.687 --> 17:31.413
It is too late for that, Kerry.

17:31.416 --> 17:33.793
I'd like everyone to look this
over before I send it out.

17:33.796 --> 17:35.950
- This sounds right.
- Mm-hmm, works for me.

17:35.957 --> 17:38.940
Look, I am the one
who hired Dr. Clemente.

17:38.946 --> 17:41.131
But you didn't keep him here.

17:41.646 --> 17:45.302
You even said that you wanted Dr. Kovac
to get rid of him, but he ignored you.

17:46.868 --> 17:48.633
That's not how it happened.

17:54.205 --> 17:55.461
Oh, Dr. Weaver.

17:55.467 --> 17:57.481
- Not now.
- Uh, rehire me, please.

17:57.485 --> 17:59.523
I'm efficient, I'm personable,
I'm a walking encyclopedia.

17:59.525 --> 18:00.860
I said not now.

18:00.865 --> 18:02.320
I'm not trying to toot my own horn, okay?

18:02.328 --> 18:05.062
But had Jerry wound up in the hands
of Barnett or Lockhart,

18:05.065 --> 18:06.813
he'd be rapping with Tupac right now.

18:06.818 --> 18:08.142
Morris, I can't help you.

18:08.147 --> 18:10.080
I know I look good in this suit,
I know I do.

18:10.087 --> 18:12.250
But I am not an ass-kissing company man.

18:12.255 --> 18:14.901
I'm an ass-kissing ER man
and I want my scrubs back!

18:14.907 --> 18:16.551
- I said that I can't help you!
- Dr. Weaver, please, please,

18:16.556 --> 18:17.852
- no, no, listen to me.
- Oh, my God, listen to me.

18:17.866 --> 18:19.511
Get off the floor, you idiot.

18:19.516 --> 18:20.990
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- I don't care!

18:20.995 --> 18:23.301
- I'm desperate! Please!
- Stop it!

18:24.096 --> 18:27.773
I can't rehire you because
I am no longer Chief of Staff.

18:31.805 --> 18:33.971
Third of Narcan, still no response.

18:34.007 --> 18:35.331
This isn't an overdose.

18:35.336 --> 18:36.780
I'm going to need
a little cricoid here.

18:36.787 --> 18:39.061
- I got it.
- I wasn't talking to you, Gates.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.633
All right, got it, I'm in. Bag him.

18:42.665 --> 18:44.661
Run of ten, systolic's only 78.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.870
100 of lido, half amp of epi
and 50 of mannitol.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.501
Mannitol? He doesn't have a head bleed.

18:49.505 --> 18:52.852
Pratt, we don't know what this is.
Until then, keep your mind open.

18:52.855 --> 18:54.443
Add a gram of ceftriaxone.

18:54.448 --> 18:55.873
You're throwing the kitchen sink
at the guy.

18:55.876 --> 18:59.250
- V tach, no pulse.
- Aww, damn, starting compressions.

18:59.446 --> 19:00.773
The strip looks weird.

19:00.776 --> 19:01.591
Why?

19:01.597 --> 19:03.143
It just doesn't look right, look.

19:03.496 --> 19:06.061
Uh, ST depressions and U waves.

19:06.068 --> 19:07.231
He's hypokalemic.

19:07.236 --> 19:08.922
Sam, add 40 of KCL.

19:08.925 --> 19:11.692
All right, charged to 200.
Come on. Clear.

19:13.705 --> 19:14.643
Still V tach.

19:14.947 --> 19:15.793
Resuming.

19:15.797 --> 19:17.561
What about periodic paralysis?

19:17.567 --> 19:18.642
- What?
- Potassium's in.

19:18.646 --> 19:21.111
Yeah, I got it wrong on the boards,
I had to go back and look it up.

19:21.307 --> 19:22.551
It's a total zebra, Gates.

19:22.557 --> 19:23.433
300. Clear.

19:23.437 --> 19:24.751
It says something about being common
in Asians.

19:24.758 --> 19:27.002
Treat with beta-blockers, not KCL.

19:27.795 --> 19:28.870
Metoprolol.

19:29.907 --> 19:30.742
May I?

19:30.746 --> 19:32.461
Well, we've got nothing to lose.

19:32.466 --> 19:33.673
All right.

19:34.785 --> 19:36.413
50 migs going in.

19:37.605 --> 19:39.553
The condition could have
stopped his breathing.

19:39.686 --> 19:41.490
Okay. Holding compressions.

19:42.366 --> 19:43.541
Back in sinus.

19:43.958 --> 19:46.223
Wow. Periodic paralysis?

19:46.227 --> 19:47.751
Really pulled that one out of your ass.

19:47.758 --> 19:49.110
Sometimes you have to try everything.

19:49.667 --> 19:50.991
Even the kitchen sink, huh?

19:50.996 --> 19:53.063
Pratt, call the ICU.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.913
Stay with him until he gets upstairs.

19:54.915 --> 19:55.910
Yeah.

19:57.355 --> 19:58.670
Dr. Kovac, I need to talk to you!

19:58.676 --> 20:00.042
- Not now, Morris.
- No, no, it's an emergency.

20:00.048 --> 20:02.612
I mean, not like an emergency-emergency,
but it's-it's important.

20:03.185 --> 20:04.042
Find me later.

20:04.315 --> 20:07.190
I want... I need... I need my job back!

20:07.387 --> 20:08.300
Later!

20:20.907 --> 20:23.680
They didn't have sugar,
so I brought the fake stuff.

20:26.615 --> 20:28.522
They don't allow coffee in here.

20:32.255 --> 20:33.681
No one's looking.

21:00.308 --> 21:06.700
You know, um...
when Eric was about three months old,

21:06.706 --> 21:11.792
he got this really terrible strain
of pneumonia and ended up in the ICU.

21:11.796 --> 21:14.041
Do you remember that at all?
You were so little.

21:15.255 --> 21:16.842
His kidneys were shutting down,

21:16.845 --> 21:20.660
and the doctors said
he wasn't going to make it.

21:25.618 --> 21:29.413
Your father and I fought because
he wanted us all to say good-bye to him.

21:29.417 --> 21:32.301
He even dressed you up and brought you
down to the hospital.

21:32.305 --> 21:33.853
Don't you remember any of that?

21:36.508 --> 21:38.052
Well, I wouldn't stand for it.

21:38.058 --> 21:39.923
I didn't care what the doctors said.

21:39.927 --> 21:42.873
It didn't matter what the doctors said.

21:42.876 --> 21:45.110
I wouldn't give up, I couldn't.

21:45.118 --> 21:47.372
Well, I'm not like you.
I think we've proven that.

21:47.377 --> 21:50.213
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
Abby, you are like me.

21:50.646 --> 21:52.222
You are like me.

21:52.505 --> 21:55.120
You have to find the strength
to get Joe through this

21:55.125 --> 21:57.350
so you can take him home with you.

21:57.357 --> 21:59.263
I don't know if I can.

22:00.308 --> 22:04.203
Oh, Abby, you've spent your whole life
getting strong enough to do this.

22:08.205 --> 22:09.433
- Abby?
- Yeah.

22:14.008 --> 22:19.713
I... I... I know the fludrozalone trial
scares you, and trust me, it scares me, too.

22:20.018 --> 22:21.500
But... No, stay.

22:23.025 --> 22:27.781
Sometimes a long shot, you know,
that weird kitchen sink thing,

22:27.788 --> 22:30.782
sometimes, sometimes it really works.

22:33.776 --> 22:35.220
What if something goes wrong?

22:35.228 --> 22:37.580
- What if it goes right?
- Can't take it back.

22:39.207 --> 22:40.250
I know that.

22:46.618 --> 22:48.551
Okay, let's do it.

22:52.008 --> 22:53.481
I hope you're right.

23:06.208 --> 23:07.492
Day of life: 15.

23:07.496 --> 23:09.800
Day seven of fludrozalone protocol.

23:09.808 --> 23:13.503
Baby's off pressors,
weight's up 37 grams.

23:13.507 --> 23:14.653
Excellent.

23:14.788 --> 23:19.060
DC the antibiotics,
decrease labs to QOD,

23:19.068 --> 23:22.801
and Baby Joe is now officially
a feeder and a grower.

23:22.807 --> 23:24.510
We'll take that as a compliment.

23:26.207 --> 23:27.551
He's so alert.

23:27.956 --> 23:29.683
- Eyes wide open.
- Yeah.

23:30.725 --> 23:32.140
Wonder what he's thinking.

23:32.455 --> 23:34.932
- "Get a life, Mom."
- Oh, gee, thanks.

23:34.938 --> 23:38.310
You haven't been out of here for more
than a few hours over the past two weeks.

23:38.437 --> 23:40.153
The two of you, go.
Go away for awhile.

23:40.158 --> 23:40.932
I don't know.

23:40.935 --> 23:42.180
I'm here.

23:45.727 --> 23:46.870
That's obnoxious.

23:46.876 --> 23:49.243
- Well, the nurses keep yakking.
- You could just ask them to stop talking.

23:49.247 --> 23:50.770
Oh, just go.
Go on.

23:50.777 --> 23:52.781
Let's take a walk.
It'll do us good.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.512
You're leaving her here?

23:55.516 --> 23:56.890
She'll be okay.

23:57.428 --> 23:58.952
Has anyone got any tape?

23:59.016 --> 24:00.650
How far was the gun from him?

24:01.197 --> 24:03.291
About ten inches or so.

24:03.706 --> 24:05.192
It's in the detective's report.

24:05.195 --> 24:09.550
That's funny, because there was
no gunshot residue on Mr. Curtis' body.

24:09.558 --> 24:13.502
In fact, the autopsy shows that you would've
had to have been at least five feet away.

24:14.157 --> 24:16.860
Well, maybe I was further.
It's hard to say.

24:16.867 --> 24:19.650
Big difference between ten inches
and five feet, Ms. Taggart.

24:19.657 --> 24:22.053
Mr. Evers, can I call you Byron?

24:22.557 --> 24:24.150
You're a very sharp guy.

24:24.477 --> 24:26.410
You got a bright future ahead of you.

24:26.835 --> 24:29.320
You think your boss is gonna
want you chasing your tail now

24:29.327 --> 24:31.470
over a guy who just shot up a hospital

24:31.826 --> 24:33.993
and raped this woman here?

24:35.128 --> 24:36.932
Maybe we should call my boss
and ask him.

24:36.938 --> 24:38.152
You think?

24:38.278 --> 24:39.763
'Cause I talked to him just this morning.

24:39.767 --> 24:42.582
In fact, we confirmed our dinner
for 7:15.

24:42.588 --> 24:46.863
We go to Gibson's every second Thursday
for the rib eye.

24:46.867 --> 24:49.883
This guy was murdered.
My job is to prosecute the law...

24:49.887 --> 24:52.453
We're not talking about the law here,
we're talking about time and money

24:52.458 --> 24:55.061
and how you're wasting both on
a creep who deserved what he got.

24:55.068 --> 24:58.761
Now I'm going to give you this opportunity
to drop this right now on your own, okay?

25:00.057 --> 25:03.161
Or you want me to handle it
over a steak and a martini?

25:06.006 --> 25:08.663
- Have you looked at the mail?
- Nothing too urgent.

25:09.905 --> 25:14.032
You should maybe check the electric bill
'cause the water was cold this morning.

25:14.686 --> 25:15.660
How's it going?

25:15.907 --> 25:16.671
Hey.

25:17.106 --> 25:18.802
It's a little bit better today.

25:18.888 --> 25:21.792
- Just get off?
- Yeah, I'm exhausted.

25:21.795 --> 25:25.481
I'm going to go and grab some dinner
at Ike's and then go home and crash.

25:27.145 --> 25:29.100
- Hang in there.
- You, too.

25:32.716 --> 25:34.052
How's she doing at work?

25:34.416 --> 25:35.780
Seems to be fine.

25:39.737 --> 25:41.900
- She still in your place?
- Yeah.

25:43.005 --> 25:44.870
She hasn't found anything.
And, you know what, I'm never there.

25:44.875 --> 25:46.382
I should just give it up.

25:46.455 --> 25:48.770
Well, you don't have
to make any decisions right now.

25:48.775 --> 25:50.801
I know, but we're a family.
We can't just

25:50.807 --> 25:53.042
keep having slumber parties.

26:01.256 --> 26:04.030
Have you thought about what I asked?

26:05.108 --> 26:06.160
I have...

26:06.518 --> 26:08.270
uh... and I haven't.

26:08.526 --> 26:09.531
It's okay.

26:10.065 --> 26:11.482
I'll convince you later.

26:16.005 --> 26:17.412
You know, we have a great life together.

26:17.416 --> 26:20.453
I don't need a ring or a white dress
to prove that I love you.

26:27.708 --> 26:28.833
I'll take love.

26:30.136 --> 26:31.963
We can save marriage for later.

26:34.177 --> 26:35.240
Luka...

26:37.006 --> 26:38.431
I hope she's okay.

26:40.255 --> 26:41.401
Who, Neela?

26:41.895 --> 26:45.310
The NICU nurse.
Your mother was driving her crazy.

26:56.965 --> 26:59.313
Excuse me, something's beeping.

27:02.905 --> 27:04.112
Not anymore.

27:04.117 --> 27:05.523
Well, you didn't even look at him.

27:05.526 --> 27:06.943
Sat wasn't picking up.

27:06.948 --> 27:08.453
It happens all the time.

27:36.206 --> 27:37.472
Excuse me.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.183
Excuse me.

27:39.797 --> 27:42.832
Something's wrong.
Dr. Raab needs to take a look.

27:42.838 --> 27:46.221
Ms. Wyzenski, the team's in radiology.
They'll come by when they're done.

27:46.228 --> 27:47.683
Well, that could take hours.

27:47.688 --> 27:51.543
If you overreact to every little blip and
bleep in this place, you'll make yourself crazy.

27:52.808 --> 27:54.793
- Page Doctor Raab.
- What?

27:54.796 --> 27:57.021
Why isn't anyone listening to me?
Page Dr. Raab.

27:57.025 --> 27:59.293
Page Dr. Raab. Page Dr. Raab.
I'm not supposed to.

27:59.297 --> 28:01.150
His belly's too big,
his breathing's too fast.

28:01.158 --> 28:03.563
- Maggie, you really need to...
- Don't you dare tell me to calm down.

28:03.566 --> 28:05.142
I don't care what Dr. Raab is doing,

28:05.147 --> 28:08.483
she needs to get down here and take care
of my grandson now!

28:09.436 --> 28:11.653
Thank God you're here.
They're putting the tube back in.

28:11.655 --> 28:14.242
- He's bradying down to 70s.
- Miller 1-3-0.

28:14.248 --> 28:16.133
- Mean BP only 24.
- What happened?

28:16.137 --> 28:18.090
I knew something was wrong,
but no one would listen.

28:18.097 --> 28:22.240
- Okay. What happened?
- Bolus 20cc's and .2 of epi ready to go.

28:22.246 --> 28:24.253
- He was blue, Abby.
- Okay. Luka?

28:24.256 --> 28:26.442
- Free air in the abdomen.
- He perfed?

28:26.907 --> 28:28.393
Good thing your mom was watching him

28:28.397 --> 28:29.651
- like a hawk.
- Is this because of the fludrozalone?

28:29.657 --> 28:31.503
- I made them pull her out of radiology.
- There's no way of knowing that.

28:31.508 --> 28:32.990
This can be fixed in surgery.

28:32.997 --> 28:35.271
Yeah, well, spontaneous intestinal perf
is one of the risks.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.553
It's one of the things
that happens to preemies.

28:37.557 --> 28:38.660
Check his breath sounds.

28:38.668 --> 28:41.370
It can be many possible explanations,
like... just...

28:41.375 --> 28:43.340
- it doesn't matter.
- It matters to me.

28:43.627 --> 28:45.393
Dr. Anspaugh's waiting for us in the O.R.

28:45.398 --> 28:47.363
- Okay, he's all yours.
- What did they...

28:47.367 --> 28:49.562
what's happening?
Where are you taking him?

28:49.607 --> 28:52.362
We'll remove any damaged tissue
and attempt a primary anastomosis.

28:52.368 --> 28:53.282
No residents.

28:53.285 --> 28:55.373
We don't want any residents
cutting on this baby.

28:55.378 --> 28:58.152
Okay, um, can you call the chaplain
and have him meet us in the O.R.

28:58.157 --> 29:00.781
- Abby, you don't have to do that.
- You said you wanted the baby baptized.

29:00.786 --> 29:02.363
You said it was important
to your family.

29:02.365 --> 29:03.660
Call the chaplain.

29:05.417 --> 29:07.791
One, two, three, and salt.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.723
- She's a pro.
- One more.

29:12.907 --> 29:15.213
- See?
- That's what I'm talking about.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.140
That's from salt.

29:19.165 --> 29:20.680
- I've got to go.
- No...

29:20.686 --> 29:22.920
- We'll walk you out.
- Oh, it's okay.

29:22.925 --> 29:25.220
- Come on.
- Whoa. Careful.

29:25.225 --> 29:27.822
I think we need to get you a cab.
Make sure you get home okay.

29:27.827 --> 29:29.882
No, you know, why don't you, uh,

29:30.258 --> 29:32.840
go and play some pool or something?

29:32.906 --> 29:34.520
Pool?
Why would we play pool?

29:34.528 --> 29:37.353
- You want fries or onion rings?
- Vegetables. I'm doing South Beach.

29:37.357 --> 29:39.193
You had a milk shake an hour ago.

29:39.225 --> 29:42.271
- You're not driving, are you?
- No, I'm not.

29:42.277 --> 29:43.782
- Well, where you going?
- We'll good take care of you.

29:43.786 --> 29:44.831
Come on, guys.

29:44.836 --> 29:46.792
All right, boys, back to the frat house,
I got this.

29:46.797 --> 29:48.961
- Dude, you got a problem?
- No, she's a friend of mine.

29:48.966 --> 29:50.150
I'm just gonna take her home.
Right, Doc?

29:50.158 --> 29:52.360
Yes. Thank you.
He's gonna take me home.

29:52.368 --> 29:54.753
- Thanks a lot.
- Little bitch.

30:01.257 --> 30:02.331
What did you say?

30:10.307 --> 30:11.891
Tony, easy, man!

30:12.345 --> 30:13.143
Tony!

30:13.146 --> 30:15.461
Easy, man, easy!
All right. Okay, okay, okay!

30:15.468 --> 30:18.960
- He gets the message.
- I got it, I got it.

30:19.656 --> 30:20.711
All right, we're gonna leave.

30:20.985 --> 30:24.682
And, uh... you fellas are gonna go home
and sleep it off or

30:24.795 --> 30:26.231
whatever you want to call it.

30:29.305 --> 30:32.241
Dissect free the vessels
to the diseased ileum.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.110
Isolated.
Mixter clamp.

30:38.558 --> 30:41.123
Systolic's only 22, I'm bolusing again.

30:41.128 --> 30:45.021
We thank you, God, for the support and
skill that surrounds and sustains life.

30:45.465 --> 30:47.330
Mobilize the hepatic flexure.

30:47.335 --> 30:49.500
We are thankful that we are known
to you by name...

30:49.528 --> 30:52.913
Careful, I don't want him third spacing
all over the place.

31:18.307 --> 31:21.910
- Really, you didn't have to do this.
- I know.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.090
Are you a boxer?

31:25.095 --> 31:26.591
You know, you should go to bed.

31:26.906 --> 31:28.343
You can sleep when you're dead.

31:29.258 --> 31:30.492
Ooh, that rhymes.

31:36.307 --> 31:38.642
- Beer?
- No, thanks.

31:38.747 --> 31:41.381
Neela, the last thing you need right now
is another drink.

31:42.006 --> 31:46.691
You know... you've got a mean left hook.

31:47.635 --> 31:49.171
I like that in a man.

31:51.156 --> 31:53.020
Do you like Sergio Mendes?

31:53.606 --> 31:55.180
I don't really know.

31:56.267 --> 32:01.571
I used to think he was really corny,
but his album is really cool.

32:09.607 --> 32:13.140
Neela, you are gonna have such
a headache in the morning.

32:14.608 --> 32:16.882
Listen, I have to go, okay?

32:16.888 --> 32:19.221
- Zadro's still in the rig.
- Oh, he can come up, too.

32:19.227 --> 32:21.552
No, no, no, you're going to lay down
and I'm going to leave, okay?

32:21.556 --> 32:23.883
- No, please don't go.
- I have to go.

32:40.205 --> 32:41.350
I'm sorry.

32:42.607 --> 32:44.342
I don't want to be alone.

32:44.506 --> 32:46.242
Is there anyone you can call?

32:47.115 --> 32:48.780
I don't have anyone.

32:57.578 --> 32:59.261
Check his sat.

33:03.095 --> 33:05.021
Terminal ileum looks dusky.

33:12.338 --> 33:13.953
I can't do this.
I can't pretend

33:13.955 --> 33:16.410
everything's gonna be okay.
Preemies don't make it out of the O.R.

33:16.417 --> 33:19.320
All the bad things you've seen,
let it go.

33:19.327 --> 33:21.543
I can't believe I let myself
get talked into this.

33:21.548 --> 33:22.910
Stop it.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.741
I spent a month in the NICU,
I know how this ends.

33:32.848 --> 33:36.632
You have a lot of great qualities,
but optimism is not one of them.

33:39.757 --> 33:41.753
- Whose fault is that?
- Yeah.

33:42.385 --> 33:43.403
All right.

33:44.367 --> 33:48.802
I did not create a good environment for a child
to grow up believing things would work out.

33:48.807 --> 33:50.930
But you're not a child any longer.

33:51.418 --> 33:53.160
You're the mother now.

33:54.338 --> 33:59.253
And that baby down there needs you
to believe he's going to be okay.

34:00.477 --> 34:02.241
Bradying down to the 60s.

34:03.766 --> 34:06.600
- Another round of epi.
- Guys, he's gray.

34:07.807 --> 34:11.571
2 of epi, 400 of calcium,
10cc's of tham, now!

34:11.574 --> 34:14.871
I'm trying, I'm really, really trying.
I'm trying.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.081
Hey!

34:35.577 --> 34:37.242
Cath lab is waiting
on your roller-blader.

34:37.245 --> 34:38.422
You need to finish the chart.

34:38.425 --> 34:39.560
Where are you going?

34:39.565 --> 34:40.920
Going to get beer for the party.

34:40.927 --> 34:42.551
It looks like Weaver
only ordered lemonade.

34:42.556 --> 34:43.620
For graduation?

34:43.626 --> 34:45.732
Yeah, she's no fun
since she's been demoted.

34:45.735 --> 34:48.373
Oh, I thought Kovac was gonna take
the flack for everything that happened.

34:48.376 --> 34:49.971
I guess it all came down on Weaver.

34:49.975 --> 34:51.152
Mm, lucky us.

34:51.746 --> 34:54.150
Hey, um, have you talked to Abby?

34:54.926 --> 34:58.501
I think they want privacy for a while.

34:58.666 --> 34:59.781
I get that.

35:01.497 --> 35:03.471
- Tell her we miss her, okay?
- Okay.

35:07.007 --> 35:08.940
- The paint has streaks.
- Streaks?

35:08.946 --> 35:10.120
I don't see any streaks.

35:10.126 --> 35:12.721
If you stand over here in the light,
you can see it has streaks.

35:12.726 --> 35:14.351
Neela, what's it look like to you?

35:14.356 --> 35:16.323
- I see streaks.
- Hey, Mayday.

35:16.638 --> 35:17.432
How are you?

35:17.437 --> 35:18.231
Great.

35:18.415 --> 35:20.752
- Look, I'm really embarrassed...
- Oh, don't be.

35:20.757 --> 35:22.073
I'm just glad it was me
who took you home.

35:22.076 --> 35:23.830
All right, Jones, this is for you.

35:23.838 --> 35:25.721
McCrary, this is for you.

35:25.728 --> 35:27.513
- Williams...
- Intern orientation.

35:27.515 --> 35:29.252
- I wouldn't wish it on anyone.
- Yeah.

35:29.257 --> 35:30.370
What are you doing here?

35:30.377 --> 35:31.582
Yo, Gates.

35:33.107 --> 35:36.012
Want me to take this or put this
in the lost and found for you?

35:36.018 --> 35:38.831
Oh, I don't do the whites.
I'm into natural fibers.

35:40.236 --> 35:42.302
You know, Gates,
you've always bugged me,

35:42.308 --> 35:45.182
but you're in my ER now,
so put on the damn coat.

35:48.336 --> 35:49.732
You're a new intern?

35:50.107 --> 35:52.102
Did my last paramedic shift yesterday.

35:52.525 --> 35:53.692
- You're kidding me.
- All right, guys,

35:53.698 --> 35:55.390
get your photos taken for
your new ID badges right that way.

35:55.396 --> 35:57.763
I look forward to working under you,
Dr. Rasgotra.

35:58.007 --> 35:59.131
Anyone hear from Jerry?

35:59.136 --> 36:00.632
He's supposed to be discharged today.

36:00.637 --> 36:03.583
Just spoke to him. He's getting a massage
from a home care nurse.

36:03.586 --> 36:06.152
Your big daddy called, wants you
to meet him outside.

36:06.155 --> 36:07.092
Really?

36:07.656 --> 36:09.583
Courtesy of Maxanoxx.

36:10.608 --> 36:12.300
Oh, come on, buck up, Morris.

36:12.307 --> 36:15.223
Just be glad you don't have to spend
the summer teaching pelvics to the new interns.

36:15.226 --> 36:17.442
- Nah, you're lucky, Pratt.
- Yeah, right.

36:17.608 --> 36:20.173
I clean vomit from my shirt
while you fly first-class.

36:20.175 --> 36:21.512
Corporate jet, actually.

36:21.517 --> 36:25.552
Sounds corny, but I never appreciated how
great it is to have a job that really matters.

36:25.555 --> 36:26.970
That suit matters, Morris.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.960
You know, that day
with Jerry was so terrible,

36:28.967 --> 36:31.482
but also kinda the best moment of my life.

36:31.488 --> 36:33.242
You know? Look at me now.

36:33.247 --> 36:34.391
So silly.

36:34.395 --> 36:36.441
Ah, well, you know, you're...
you're doing a service.

36:36.445 --> 36:39.393
I mean, you're educating
the medical community for, uh...

36:39.395 --> 36:41.803
Oh, it's a load of crap, Greg.
We all know it, okay?

36:41.806 --> 36:44.492
- I sold out to the man.
- Well, I guess you never spoke to Kovac.

36:44.498 --> 36:46.030
No, he didn't return my calls.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.193
Well, he is pretty preoccupied
these days.

36:48.198 --> 36:50.330
I guess I could always try
doing this somewhere else.

36:51.565 --> 36:53.513
At least I figured out what's important,

36:53.516 --> 36:55.510
and I want to practice medicine again.

36:56.425 --> 36:59.043
I'm gonna go do my thing for
the Critical Care Department.

36:59.475 --> 37:00.881
I'll see you around.

37:01.505 --> 37:02.650
All right, man.

37:02.656 --> 37:05.613
That waffle iron thief left AMA.

37:06.648 --> 37:08.203
Hey, you know where Kovac is?

37:08.206 --> 37:09.162
No.

37:19.208 --> 37:20.452
What are you doing here?

37:20.707 --> 37:23.371
Well, the DA determined
it was justifiable homicide.

37:24.806 --> 37:25.980
This is over.

37:29.007 --> 37:30.250
I can't believe it.

37:32.546 --> 37:34.733
Every day I keep thinking
they're gonna come and arrest me.

37:34.737 --> 37:36.221
Well, you stop worrying about that.

37:36.497 --> 37:38.103
Just focus on Alex.

37:39.315 --> 37:40.561
You talk to him about it?

37:41.495 --> 37:46.370
Uh... he knows his dad has gone,
but I need to talk to him more about it.

37:47.606 --> 37:48.763
You're a good mom.

37:49.387 --> 37:51.051
I just wanted to tell you
that in person.

37:52.927 --> 37:54.422
Anything else you need...

38:04.508 --> 38:07.533
The key here is
the glucuronyl side group,

38:07.537 --> 38:11.063
which gives Maxanoxx higher specificity
for the alpha one receptor.

38:11.065 --> 38:13.273
Why-why invest in a course of Maxanoxx

38:13.277 --> 38:16.692
when we have cheaper drugs for pulmonary
edema that are entirely effective?

38:16.697 --> 38:21.042
Well, you'll see here that a subgroup
of patients had .4 fewer ICU days...

38:21.047 --> 38:23.901
But there was no difference
in the overall outcome.

38:24.548 --> 38:27.183
Do you know what one day
in the ICU costs taxpayers?

38:27.187 --> 38:29.531
I mean, this hospital?
Society?

38:29.946 --> 38:31.950
Morris. May I speak to you out here now?

38:31.955 --> 38:33.731
Not a good time, Dr. Pratt.

38:34.457 --> 38:37.153
Uh, you'll save money in the long run.
Trust me.

38:37.158 --> 38:38.611
It's an emergency.

38:40.778 --> 38:42.000
Excuse me a moment.

38:46.378 --> 38:47.683
What? What is it?

38:47.687 --> 38:49.250
Can't you-can't you see I'm working?

38:50.296 --> 38:52.630
Kovac is gonna offer you the job.

39:00.008 --> 39:02.783
You know, stick with Lasix.
Maxanoxx is a scam.

39:06.656 --> 39:10.923
You know, it's great Kovac offered
Morris that attending spot.

39:11.107 --> 39:13.752
Well, he's like a stray dog.
He'd just keep coming back.

39:14.528 --> 39:16.451
Hey, you know that blunt chest
trauma today?

39:16.458 --> 39:19.272
Stuck a needle in the heart and got half
a liter out of the pericardium.

39:19.278 --> 39:20.950
That's not bad for an intern.

39:20.955 --> 39:22.553
Oh, I had a good teacher.

39:25.105 --> 39:26.191
Have you two met?

39:26.196 --> 39:28.180
Oh. Oh, yeah, I've seen you around.

39:28.187 --> 39:30.043
Hey, I'm Tony Gates. Intern.

39:30.295 --> 39:32.621
Ray Barnett. R-3.

39:32.627 --> 39:35.553
Maybe tomorrow you can show me how
to do an open pericardial window.

39:35.555 --> 39:37.392
Oh, I can show you how to do that.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.871
If you'll excuse me...

39:42.206 --> 39:46.562
You know, I hear she had a roommate
who never tried to sleep with her.

39:46.567 --> 39:48.480
Yeah, what a dill weed.

39:50.705 --> 39:52.522
So, can I call you Kerry, now?

39:52.526 --> 39:54.040
- I don't think so.
- Why?

39:54.047 --> 39:57.121
- We're colleagues, we're contemporaries.
- Hey, no touch, no touch.

39:57.937 --> 39:58.692
Luka!

39:58.696 --> 39:59.560
Hey.

40:00.847 --> 40:01.850
Sorry I'm late.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.240
Hey, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

40:03.245 --> 40:07.071
I had to see it for myself,
Archie Morris and Greg Pratt.

40:07.105 --> 40:09.220
- Attendings, huh?
- Is Abby coming?

40:09.457 --> 40:12.982
Uh... she wanted to, but not...
not tonight.

40:13.306 --> 40:14.812
How's she holding up?

40:15.005 --> 40:17.172
She's okay.
She's doing okay.

40:38.038 --> 40:39.191
It's almost time.

40:40.758 --> 40:41.893
You called a cab?

40:43.086 --> 40:44.922
Yeah. It'll be here any minute.

40:46.706 --> 40:47.833
So, uh...

40:48.977 --> 40:50.412
When are you coming back?

40:51.008 --> 40:53.591
Oh, my God, is that an invitation?

40:53.905 --> 40:55.880
I guess it is, yeah.

40:56.538 --> 41:01.843
I mean the, uh... the signs and the notes
were a little crazy, but, um...

41:03.907 --> 41:06.183
I don't think I could have got
through this without you.

41:06.185 --> 41:08.133
Oh, you would have found a way.

41:08.136 --> 41:09.360
You're a fighter.

41:09.367 --> 41:11.880
My God, you've been fighting with me
since the day you were born.

41:11.887 --> 41:15.350
I'd say "Honey, wear the cute little
pink dress," so you'd wear the jeans.

41:15.356 --> 41:18.773
I'd say, "What a nice little drawing you've
done," and you'd throw it in the trash.

41:18.778 --> 41:21.671
I told you to be a lawyer
and you became a doctor.

41:23.347 --> 41:24.943
My greatest hope...

41:25.566 --> 41:33.092
would be this little guy causes you
as much agony and pain as you caused me.

41:33.605 --> 41:36.263
Would serve you right.
I gotta go.

41:36.708 --> 41:38.420
Uh, hey. Uh, hey.

41:40.387 --> 41:43.060
You don't have to go today, you know.

41:45.045 --> 41:46.811
You'll be fine.

41:47.988 --> 41:49.063
Mom.

41:50.727 --> 41:52.690
I love you.
