[ Man ] Once upon a time in
a village in ancient India,

00:31.231 --> 00:34.768
there was a little goat
and a priest.

00:34.901 --> 00:38.905
The priest wanted to
sacrifice the goat to the gods.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.075
He raised his arm
to cut the goat's throat,

00:42.208 --> 00:45.712
when suddenly
the goat began to laugh.

00:45.812 --> 00:50.283
The priest stopped, amazed,
and asked the goat,

00:50.417 --> 00:54.821
"Why do you laugh? Don't you know
I'm about to cut your throat?"

00:54.888 --> 00:57.123
"Oh, yes," said the goat.

00:57.257 --> 01:00.560
"After 499 times dying...

01:00.660 --> 01:03.430
and being reborn as a goat,

01:03.496 --> 01:07.133
I will be reborn
as a human being."

01:07.233 --> 01:10.337
Then the little goat
began to cry.

01:10.470 --> 01:13.473
The high priest said,
"Why now are you crying?"

01:13.606 --> 01:17.544
And the goat replied,
"For you, poor priest.

01:17.677 --> 01:22.449
500 lives ago,
I too was a high priest...

01:22.515 --> 01:25.452
and sacrificed goats
to the gods."

01:25.552 --> 01:29.222
The priest dropped
to his knees, saying,

01:29.289 --> 01:31.124
"Forgive me, I beg you.

01:31.224 --> 01:35.428
From now on, I will be the guardian and
protector of every goat in the land."

Ah, yes, the goat.

as a human being,

- You all right?
- Uh, yes,

01:51:41.835 --> 01:51:43.703
thank you.

01:51:43.837 --> 01:51:46.272
A little overcome,
that's all.

01:51:47.907 --> 01:51:51.945
- [ Sighs ]
- It's been a kind of
emotional time for all of us.

01:51:52.045 --> 01:51:55.348
I'm afraid... I'm not
a very good example...

01:51:55.448 --> 01:51:57.817
of Buddhist detachment.

01:51:59.085 --> 01:52:01.755
Children.
We are all children.

01:52:03.423 --> 01:52:05.658
Um...

01:52:08.828 --> 01:52:11.164
the bowl
is for Jesse.

01:52:13.166 --> 01:52:15.268
And, uh,

01:52:15.402 --> 01:52:18.238
this is for you.

01:52:18.304 --> 01:52:21.307
My work is done.

01:52:21.441 --> 01:52:23.543
Now I can rest.

01:52:24.811 --> 01:52:28.014
I can go back
to... Tibet,

01:52:29.716 --> 01:52:32.419
to the place
I was born.

01:52:33.853 --> 01:52:35.855
[ Chuckling ]

01:52:35.922 --> 01:52:39.726
You still don't believe
in reincarnation,

01:52:39.859 --> 01:52:41.961
do you?
[ Chuckling ]

01:52:44.731 --> 01:52:47.100
[ Continues
Chuckling ]

01:52:47.233 --> 01:52:49.269
[ Coughs, Gasps ]

01:52:49.336 --> 01:52:51.237
[ Pants ]

01:57:35.622 --> 01:57:38.758
Yesterday, he talked about
going back to Tibet.

01:57:38.858 --> 01:57:41.294
He must have meant
something different.

01:57:43.163 --> 01:57:46.499
Someone like Lama Norbu
can remain like this...

01:57:46.566 --> 01:57:48.401
for ten days...

01:57:49.536 --> 01:57:51.871
or even more.

01:57:51.938 --> 01:57:56.609
He can sit like a mountain,
serene and unmovable.

01:57:56.710 --> 01:58:00.313
And he can meditate
deep and vast as ocean.

01:58:00.413 --> 01:58:02.916
And then, smoothly,

01:58:03.049 --> 01:58:07.120
while doing meditation,
he can enter into the state of death...

01:58:07.253 --> 01:58:09.689
with his own will.

01:58:09.823 --> 01:58:12.826
- He's dying.
- We're all dying every minute.

01:58:14.327 --> 01:58:16.329
Death is a big part
of life.

01:58:17.931 --> 01:58:21.601
Every breath that
we breathe... we die.

01:58:21.668 --> 01:58:24.204
What about
his passion for life?

01:58:24.304 --> 01:58:26.873
What about the people
he's leaving behind?

01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:28.708
He will come back.

01:58:28.842 --> 01:58:32.412
I don't know if I believe it,
but I'd like to.

01:58:34.247 --> 01:58:38.018
[ Drumming, Chanting ]

01:58:56.803 --> 01:58:59.606
[ Drumming,
Chanting Continue ]

02:00:58.658 --> 02:01:01.461
- Lama Norbu passed away.
- [ All Chanting ]

02:01:24.484 --> 02:01:27.253
[ Chanting Continues ]

02:01:32.058 --> 02:01:35.228
[ Lama Norbu's Voice ]
Raju!

02:01:35.328 --> 02:01:38.098
Jesse! Gita!

02:01:39.499 --> 02:01:42.736
They are chanting
the Heart Sutra.

02:01:42.869 --> 02:01:45.205
The beautiful prayer.

02:01:45.271 --> 02:01:48.675
Keep it with you
in your hearts, always.

02:01:48.808 --> 02:01:51.644
[ Chanting ]

02:01:52.746 --> 02:01:55.615
Form is empty.

02:01:55.715 --> 02:01:57.550
Emptiness is form.

02:01:57.650 --> 02:02:02.722
No eye, ear, nose,

02:02:02.856 --> 02:02:05.625
tongue,

02:02:05.692 --> 02:02:08.895
body, mind.

02:02:08.962 --> 02:02:11.965
No color, sound,

02:02:12.065 --> 02:02:15.268
smell, taste,

02:02:15.335 --> 02:02:19.472
touch, existing thing.

02:02:48.435 --> 02:02:50.236
[ Chuckling Quietly ]

02:02:58.845 --> 02:03:00.880
Lama Norbu just said:

02:03:00.947 --> 02:03:03.350
No eye, no ear, no nose.

02:03:03.483 --> 02:03:06.319
No Jesse, no Lama!

02:03:08.655 --> 02:03:10.623
No you!

02:03:10.724 --> 02:03:12.625
No death and no fear!

02:03:42.255 --> 02:03:46.059
[ Lama Norbu ]
No old age in death.

02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:52.465
No end to old age
in death.

02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:55.802
No suffering.

02:03:55.869 --> 02:03:57.904
No "cause of"...

02:03:58.038 --> 02:04:01.107
or "end to"... suffering.

02:04:02.742 --> 02:04:04.878
No path.

02:04:04.944 --> 02:04:06.813
No wisdom.

02:04:07.881 --> 02:04:10.717
And no gain.

02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:13.286
No gain.

02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:16.623
Thus bodhisattvas lived...

02:04:16.723 --> 02:04:22.028
in perfect understanding
with no hindrance of mind.

02:04:22.095 --> 02:04:24.030
No hindrance,

02:04:24.097 --> 02:04:27.100
therefore, no fear.

02:04:27.233 --> 02:04:31.438
Far beyond deluded thoughts.

02:04:31.504 --> 02:04:34.474
This is Nirvana.

02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:06.873
- I can't get it open.
- I'll show you.

02:05:08.641 --> 02:05:10.944
This is
Lama Norbu's kata.

02:05:13.246 --> 02:05:15.115
This is Lama Norbu.

02:05:21.354 --> 02:05:25.325
[ Dean ]
Come on, buddy! Give me a hand here.

02:05:34.634 --> 02:05:36.436
Come on, Lisa.
Everybody goes!

02:05:36.503 --> 02:05:38.505
Okay, I'm coming!

02:05:39.739 --> 02:05:42.642
I only wish we had
a crane to get me on board.

02:06:52.445 --> 02:06:54.381
I can hear him kicking!

02:06:55.615 --> 02:06:57.417
Or her.

02:06:59.652 --> 02:07:03.056
Hey, Jesse.
Is it time?

02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:06.359
Yes.
I think it's time.
