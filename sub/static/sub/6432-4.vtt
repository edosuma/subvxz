09:11.837 --> 09:13.538
You're not gonna
call my parents, are you?

09:13.539 --> 09:16.340
No, just next time

09:16.375 --> 09:17.508
Well, I don't get it.

09:17.509 --> 09:18.976
Was beating up that kid
one of your goals?

09:18.977 --> 09:21.512
No, but I had to get
onto the I.M.T. calculus team,

09:21.513 --> 09:23.414
and there was only
one spot left.

09:23.449 --> 09:26.751
So that gigantor
is a calculus expert?

09:26.785 --> 09:28.520
All right.

09:28.521 --> 09:30.589
Look, we, uh... we're gonna
need that marble back now.

09:30.623 --> 09:32.758
Fine.

09:32.759 --> 09:34.893
Agent Lattimer,
thank you for waiting.

09:34.894 --> 09:37.530
I'm still not sure why
the secret service cares about...

09:37.531 --> 09:38.765
Uh, school violence.

09:38.766 --> 09:40.767
Yeah, the president's
made it one of his

09:40.768 --> 09:42.102
top priorities this year.

09:42.136 --> 09:43.436
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

09:43.437 --> 09:45.439
Tommy, pulling this
during I.M.T. week?

09:45.473 --> 09:47.207
Thanks to the absurd
budget cuts

09:47.241 --> 09:49.376
our esteemed school board
is making,

09:49.377 --> 09:51.946
we're all under pressure
to generate more alumni support.

09:51.980 --> 09:53.881
The atmosphere's already
fraught with tension.

09:53.882 --> 09:56.650
The board must see I.M.T.
as a success.

09:56.651 --> 09:58.586
I have to enforce
a zero tolerance policy.

09:58.620 --> 10:01.489
I'm sorry.

10:03.225 --> 10:04.391
Great.
Hear that?

10:04.392 --> 10:06.226
The atmosphere's fraught
with tension.

10:06.227 --> 10:08.129
Yeah, throw in some
violent, deadly marbles

and <i>Harry Potter</i>
becomes <i>full metal jacket.</i>

10:13.935 --> 10:15.202
There's nothing here

10:15.203 --> 10:19.973
except a lot of seriously
depressing stories.

10:25.614 --> 10:27.481
Hey, uh, Steve.

10:27.482 --> 10:29.450
You know,
I know what it's like

10:29.485 --> 10:31.219

being away.

10:31.220 --> 10:33.621
So if you ever wanna talk...

Kinda different
circumstances though,

wouldn't you say?

10:37.693 --> 10:38.826
Yes, it is.

10:38.827 --> 10:40.094
But still, talking's talking.

10:40.095 --> 10:42.430
I'm good.
Really, I am fine.

10:42.431 --> 10:43.865
Really?

10:43.866 --> 10:45.133
It's ironic, you know?

10:45.168 --> 10:50.305
The guy who can see lies
is actually a terrible liar.

10:50.340 --> 10:51.773
You know, Pete warned
me about this.

10:51.774 --> 10:53.609
He said if you started
talking about feelings

10:53.610 --> 10:56.711
that I should just
change the subject.

10:56.712 --> 10:58.947
Really?
Like Pete has feelings.

10:58.948 --> 11:00.214
You don't wanna
talk about it.

11:00.215 --> 11:01.282
That's... that's fine.

11:01.316 --> 11:02.349
You're right.

11:02.350 --> 11:05.285
There is nothing in here.

11:05.286 --> 11:08.121
Steve.

11:08.155 --> 11:11.491
Steve, come look at this.

11:11.526 --> 11:13.460
It's a jazz club
right down the street.

11:13.461 --> 11:15.028
"The altered scale."

11:15.029 --> 11:18.298
Does the logo look familiar?

11:18.299 --> 11:21.268
Alex had it on his t-shirt,
so we know that he's been there.

11:21.269 --> 11:23.670
Well, given how close
the bar is,

11:23.704 --> 11:26.973
and how any patient who's
been here would've seen it...

11:27.008 --> 11:28.475
Well, maybe we should
talk to them and find out

11:28.476 --> 11:31.544
if any other patients
like jazz and free drinks.

11:31.545 --> 11:34.714
Both: I know I do.

11:34.715 --> 11:37.250
Here's a list
of the other three guys.

11:37.251 --> 11:39.218
What if they turn violent
like Tommy did?

11:39.219 --> 11:40.486
Hey, don't worry
about it.

11:40.487 --> 11:44.056
You're gonna be celebrating
in no time.

11:44.090 --> 11:46.658
Hey, brade-ster, you probably
know their schedules, right?

11:46.659 --> 11:48.160
So let's figure out
what classes

11:48.161 --> 11:49.828
- your pals are in right now.
- You okay?

11:49.829 --> 11:51.830
Yeah, yeah.
I just... I'm...

11:51.831 --> 11:55.000
I was careless
with an artifact again.

11:55.001 --> 11:57.002
And now my nephew
is in trouble.

11:57.003 --> 11:58.470
Hey, it's all right,
accidents happens.

11:58.471 --> 11:59.738
Don't beat yourself
up about it.

11:59.739 --> 12:01.740
You can just get Tommy
to do that.

12:01.775 --> 12:04.043
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

12:04.044 --> 12:08.614
Okay, guys,
let's split up,

12:08.615 --> 12:10.816
and get us some marbles.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.885
- Come on, we'll fix this.
- Right.

12:12.886 --> 12:15.855
So what do you think,
home in time for dinner?

12:15.889 --> 12:19.192
It used to belong
to some old sheriff I think.

12:19.193 --> 12:20.593
Jack Duncan,

12:20.628 --> 12:22.295
the most successful
bounty hunter in new Mexico,

12:22.296 --> 12:23.963
not some old sheriff.

12:23.964 --> 12:26.033
Details, specifics,
they matter.

12:26.034 --> 12:28.335
That's how we understand

12:28.336 --> 12:29.603
what these artifacts
actually do.

12:29.637 --> 12:32.572
Of course, of course.
It's fascinating.

12:32.573 --> 12:34.040
Well, from what I've learned,

12:34.041 --> 12:36.209
this spur can help us
track the movement

12:36.210 --> 12:38.445
of the missing astrolabe...

12:38.446 --> 12:41.314
[Laughs]

12:41.315 --> 12:44.651
The way a... the way
a bounty hunter tracks a person.

12:44.652 --> 12:46.252
That's... that's quite good.

12:46.253 --> 12:48.088
Yes, isn't it?

12:48.122 --> 12:51.758
Unfortunately,
the regents, they...

12:51.759 --> 12:54.728
They're our board of directors
and they're rather strict.

12:54.729 --> 12:56.196
And warehouse agents
aren't allowed

12:56.197 --> 12:58.098
to actually use
these artifacts.

12:58.132 --> 12:59.566
Understandable.

12:59.567 --> 13:02.737
However, given the danger
of the astrolabe,

13:02.738 --> 13:04.639
isn't it in all
of our interests,

13:04.640 --> 13:06.641

and mine,

13:06.642 --> 13:09.577
to retrieve it
by any means necessary?

13:09.612 --> 13:12.914
It would take a tremendous
amount of digging

13:12.915 --> 13:15.550
into how this spur
actually works

13:15.551 --> 13:18.152
to know what the potential
downsides are.

13:18.153 --> 13:20.788
See, we don't just
rush into these things

13:20.789 --> 13:23.257
without a huge amount of...

13:23.258 --> 13:26.026
Research.
Mm-hmm.

13:26.027 --> 13:27.761
These are my findings.

13:27.762 --> 13:30.431
- You have findings.
- Yes, I do.

13:30.465 --> 13:33.967
Histories of the spur's use,
plus anecdotal evidence

13:34.001 --> 13:35.936
showing minimal downside.

13:35.937 --> 13:39.039
Horses will be afraid of you
for a couple of days.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.508
Do you ride horses?

13:41.542 --> 13:43.410
What a relief.

13:43.411 --> 13:45.846
So now you're free to show me
how all of this works.

13:45.847 --> 13:48.449
Ahh, this is exciting,
isn't it?

13:58.059 --> 13:59.693
It could be any
of these things.

13:59.694 --> 14:01.628
Well, whatever it is,
we need to be careful.

14:01.663 --> 14:03.297
None of the patients
can remember exactly

14:03.298 --> 14:04.631
what happened to them
when they were here,

14:04.666 --> 14:07.167
which means that there's
a memory thing

14:07.201 --> 14:08.936
attached to whatever it is
that we're looking for.

14:08.937 --> 14:10.137
I'm still trying
to understand

14:10.138 --> 14:12.306
how losing horrible memories
is a bad thing.

14:12.307 --> 14:14.708
Because when an artifact
makes it happen,

14:14.709 --> 14:17.011
I mean, who knows
what the price will be?

14:17.012 --> 14:18.579

14:18.580 --> 14:20.247
Yes. Hi.

14:20.248 --> 14:23.050
Uh, we were just wondering

14:23.051 --> 14:28.354
if any new objects have
shown up here recently.

14:28.389 --> 14:30.523
New objects?

14:55.116 --> 14:56.382

28:11.476 --> 28:13.711
Will you condemn
the rest of the world

28:13.712 --> 28:16.881
to live with your evil?

28:16.882 --> 28:20.485
[Panting]
It's okay.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.988
This is what I want.

28:22.989 --> 28:24.523
[Coughing]

28:24.558 --> 28:26.425
Steve!

28:26.460 --> 28:27.793
Hey, come on.

28:27.794 --> 28:29.362
[Coughing]

28:29.396 --> 28:31.030
[Sighs]

28:31.065 --> 28:32.665
But it's killing you.

28:32.700 --> 28:35.068
It's worth it.

28:37.371 --> 28:38.370
I can help you too.

28:38.372 --> 28:41.374
No!

28:41.408 --> 28:42.642
I can take away
your pain.

28:42.677 --> 28:44.711
No, you can't.

28:44.712 --> 28:46.679
[Grunts]

28:46.714 --> 28:49.382
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

28:53.754 --> 28:55.488
This is all my fault.

28:55.523 --> 28:57.790
- This isn't your fault.
- Yes, it is my fault.

28:57.825 --> 29:00.114
Brady knew about the marbles
because I showed them to him.

29:00.127 --> 29:01.949
- I told him how they worked.
- What?

29:01.962 --> 29:03.663
Why... why would you
do something like that?

29:03.664 --> 29:06.031
I didn't mean for him
to use them.

29:06.032 --> 29:08.967
But... he's smart.
He's special.

29:08.968 --> 29:10.368
Oh.

29:10.369 --> 29:12.334
Oh, my God.

29:12.338 --> 29:16.073
You... you wanted him to become
a warehouse agent like you.

29:16.074 --> 29:17.808
That's... that's why you
showed them to him?

29:17.843 --> 29:19.943
Uh...

29:25.683 --> 29:27.433
What is this?

29:27.452 --> 29:29.887
This is my pain.

29:29.888 --> 29:33.157
Please stop.

29:33.158 --> 29:35.226
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

29:35.227 --> 29:37.228
I'm just having
a little trouble breathing.

29:37.229 --> 29:38.697
This is another downside.

29:38.698 --> 29:40.198
What is wrong with me?

29:40.199 --> 29:42.500
Why are you taking this out
on yourself?

29:42.501 --> 29:43.902
For 30 years,
I didn't exist.

29:43.903 --> 29:45.537
Then I got a second chance.

29:45.538 --> 29:47.035
But was that enough for me?
No.

29:47.039 --> 29:49.040
I had to leave a legacy...
Brady.

29:49.041 --> 29:52.143
- I was greedy.
- No, reckless, maybe...

29:52.144 --> 29:53.311
But not greedy.

29:53.312 --> 29:56.814
And I'm... I'm gonna be fine,
I think.

29:56.815 --> 29:58.516
What if I've run out
of second chances?

29:58.517 --> 30:02.718
What if the universe
is making you and Brady

30:02.722 --> 30:06.591
pay for my mistakes?

30:06.592 --> 30:08.057
- Aah!
- Stop, stop.

30:08.061 --> 30:09.561
You're choking, Claudia.
You could kill her.

30:09.562 --> 30:12.097
What?

30:12.098 --> 30:15.689
Aah, no!

30:15.702 --> 30:17.670
[Panting]

30:21.008 --> 30:23.109
Aah!

30:23.110 --> 30:25.157
[Gasps]

30:29.015 --> 30:30.382
There.
See?

30:30.417 --> 30:33.085
It was probably just
a little bit of stress.

30:33.086 --> 30:34.353
I'm fine.

30:34.354 --> 30:35.788
Brady's gonna be fine
in a minute.

30:35.789 --> 30:37.657
And by the way,
I don't think the universe

30:37.658 --> 30:40.260
hurts teenage boys
to punish their wacky uncles.

30:40.294 --> 30:41.895
I did this to him.

30:41.929 --> 30:43.930
Hugo...

30:43.931 --> 30:46.899
If Brady is going to become
the warehouse agent

30:46.900 --> 30:48.767
- you hope he will be...
- Yeah.

30:48.802 --> 30:50.336
Then save him.

30:50.337 --> 30:51.637
The only way we're gonna
help him

30:51.638 --> 30:53.505
is if we find the headmaster
and that last marble.

30:53.539 --> 30:56.175
So we need you, Hugo.

30:56.209 --> 30:57.376
We're running out of time.

30:57.410 --> 31:01.379
I will not undo
what I have done.

31:01.414 --> 31:03.915
The brotherhood
is more powerful than you think.

31:03.950 --> 31:07.052
I work for some pretty
powerful people myself.

31:07.086 --> 31:11.322
You came into my house
and stole from me,

31:11.323 --> 31:13.424
dismantled my life's work,

31:13.425 --> 31:17.495
and I will respond in kind.

31:17.496 --> 31:20.464
Things have already
been set in motion.

31:22.634 --> 31:24.701
And unlike your regents,

31:24.702 --> 31:27.738
we follow no rules.

31:27.772 --> 31:31.742
We do whatever
has to be done.

31:35.313 --> 31:36.546
[Farnsworth buzzes]

31:36.547 --> 31:37.647
Yeah?

31:37.648 --> 31:39.182
Guys, we got a code red.

31:39.183 --> 31:40.317
The entire school's here.

31:40.318 --> 31:41.952
No one can find
the headmaster.

31:41.953 --> 31:46.055
Okay, and my... my vibes
are off the charts and...

31:46.056 --> 31:48.758
Oh, crap.

31:48.792 --> 31:49.925
It's the school board.

31:49.960 --> 31:53.161
The headmaster's targets.

31:53.162 --> 31:55.430
If this guy's planning
on getting revenge in here,

31:55.431 --> 31:59.266
there's gonna be a whole lot
of kids caught in the crossfire.

32:05.136 --> 32:08.105
[Cheers and applause]

32:11.576 --> 32:13.110
This is a lot of kids.

32:13.111 --> 32:14.244
Yeah, and
I don't need vibes

32:14.245 --> 32:17.748
to know this is gonna
get bad.

32:17.749 --> 32:20.351
Look, Hugo, if the headmaster
had a weapon

32:20.352 --> 32:22.453
like a... I don't know,
a rifle or something,

32:22.454 --> 32:24.656
is there any place he could hide
to get a clean shot?

32:24.657 --> 32:26.391
Everything's exposed.

32:26.392 --> 32:28.360
Well, he's here somewhere.

32:28.361 --> 32:30.997
No, there was only
one place we could...

32:30.998 --> 32:32.631
- Pete.
- Yeah?

32:32.632 --> 32:33.799
That door.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.134
Where does it lead?

32:35.135 --> 32:37.036
- The furnace room.
- Which is where?

32:37.037 --> 32:38.705
Underneath the gym.

32:38.706 --> 32:40.140
All right, look,
you guys stay here

32:40.141 --> 32:43.110
and keep looking for him
in case he shows up.

32:46.381 --> 32:49.349
[Distant cheers and applause]

33:21.616 --> 33:24.317
[Grunts]

33:24.318 --> 33:26.986
You're in my way.

33:32.526 --> 33:33.993
Stay right there.

33:33.994 --> 33:35.328
Someone has to stop the board
from tearing

33:35.329 --> 33:38.564
this school apart,
program by program.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.166
What is that stuff?

33:40.167 --> 33:41.434
Before I was
an administrator,

33:41.435 --> 33:42.801
I was a chemistry teacher...

33:42.802 --> 33:44.603
Another program
they wanna cut.

33:44.604 --> 33:47.773
Furnace will turn this compound
into a gas in 60 seconds.

33:47.774 --> 33:50.809
School board is sitting right
under the vents in the gym.

33:50.810 --> 33:53.545
That will be that.

33:53.546 --> 33:55.113
They're not the only ones
in there.

33:55.114 --> 33:57.448
You're gonna poison
the whole damn student body.

33:57.449 --> 33:58.482
Collateral damage.

33:58.483 --> 34:02.019
Stop the board,
that's the goal.

34:03.588 --> 34:05.556
It's good to have goals.

34:05.557 --> 34:08.192
- Yaah!
- [Grunts]

34:11.797 --> 34:14.098
Now that's how
you knock somebody out.

34:14.099 --> 34:16.833
Yeah, so if this stuff
turns into gas...

34:16.835 --> 34:18.467
No, Pete, you've got
to shut down the furnace

34:18.469 --> 34:19.467
before that happens.

34:19.469 --> 34:20.871
Okay.

34:20.871 --> 34:22.839
Um...

34:22.840 --> 34:27.043
I got it.

34:27.045 --> 34:28.277
Eww.

34:28.313 --> 34:31.547
It's all wires
and circuits and stuff.

34:31.549 --> 34:32.783
Oh, hang tight.
I'll be right down.

34:32.817 --> 34:34.751
No, Claud, no.
You won't make it in time.

34:34.752 --> 34:37.254
Just get everybody
out of there...

34:37.255 --> 34:39.755
In case I can't
pull this off.

34:43.761 --> 34:45.262
Okay, Pete, come on.
Come on, Pete.

34:45.263 --> 34:47.230
Think, think.

34:47.231 --> 34:49.399
Just focus, focus.

34:49.400 --> 34:52.402
What do I need to focus?

34:54.539 --> 34:57.374
A marble.

34:57.375 --> 34:58.509
Come on.

34:58.510 --> 35:00.077
[Chuckles]

35:00.078 --> 35:01.411
Hey there, little buddy.

35:01.412 --> 35:02.980
I'm gonna need your help.

35:02.981 --> 35:05.882
So please work
and don't kill me.

35:05.883 --> 35:07.283
All right, heathers,
very nice.

35:07.284 --> 35:08.418
Heather, Heather, Heather,

35:08.419 --> 35:09.452
Heather, and Heather,
let's not have

35:09.453 --> 35:10.654
a brain tumor
for breakfast.

35:10.655 --> 35:11.855
Everybody out this way,
please.

35:11.856 --> 35:13.490
Now whatever you do,
don't panic.

35:13.491 --> 35:15.692
Trampling each other
will only make it worse

35:15.693 --> 35:17.594
if the poison gas gets out.

35:17.595 --> 35:18.995
Did you just say
poison gas?

35:18.996 --> 35:20.864
Yeah, it's kind of
a chemical reaction, you know?

35:20.865 --> 35:22.133
Oh, my gosh, come on.

35:22.134 --> 35:24.268
Hugo, probably best
not to use words

35:24.269 --> 35:25.870
like "poison" or "trampling."

35:25.871 --> 35:26.904
Right.

35:26.905 --> 35:28.473
Okay, boys, carry on.

35:28.474 --> 35:30.142
All right, Mr. Davis,

35:30.143 --> 35:32.377
eighth grade shop class,

35:32.378 --> 35:37.349
you told me to start
with the ground, so...

35:39.185 --> 35:40.619
Whoa.
[Laughs]

35:40.620 --> 35:43.956
Wow, that is so not uncool.

35:43.957 --> 35:45.858
We're never gonna get all
these kids out of here in time.

35:45.859 --> 35:47.326
Well, just... just...
Just a sec, Claud.

35:47.327 --> 35:50.563
Pete, it's kind of
a now-or-never situation.

35:50.564 --> 35:52.232
Okay.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.000
Here we go.

35:54.001 --> 35:57.136
Up we go.

35:57.137 --> 36:00.207
Okay.

36:00.208 --> 36:02.242
[Powers down]

36:02.243 --> 36:05.645
[Laughs]

36:05.646 --> 36:08.781
Oh, Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis.

36:08.782 --> 36:11.183
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

36:11.184 --> 36:12.585
Hey.

36:12.586 --> 36:16.756
You got it, right?

36:16.757 --> 36:19.125
Pete, your arm.

36:19.126 --> 36:20.927
Pete?

36:20.928 --> 36:23.529
- Pete!
- Hi.

36:23.530 --> 36:26.432
- Yeah.
- Yep, let's do this.

36:26.433 --> 36:28.535
What the hell was that?

36:28.536 --> 36:30.637
Did I just...

36:30.638 --> 36:32.672
Did I try to kill the...

36:32.673 --> 36:35.141
No. Kill?
No.

36:35.142 --> 36:36.710
No, no, no.
What did...

36:36.711 --> 36:39.145
Well, maybe...
What did you have for lunch?

36:39.146 --> 36:40.780
Nothing, just, uh, salad.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.034
Salad.

36:42.049 --> 36:43.783
- Yeah, it's the mushrooms.
- Yep, mushrooms.

36:43.784 --> 36:45.318
It's all taken care of.

36:45.319 --> 36:47.720
It's all... the government's
taking care of that, so...

36:47.721 --> 36:50.055
- Bad batch.
- Mushrooms.

36:50.056 --> 36:52.725
Whoa, good.
Thanks.

36:52.726 --> 36:55.360
All right, let's go get
that head taken care of, huh?

37:01.366 --> 37:04.802
Claudia, thank you.

37:04.803 --> 37:06.103
No way, you were the one
who figured out

37:06.137 --> 37:07.838
he was in the furnace room,
so...

37:07.839 --> 37:09.172
Not about that.

37:09.173 --> 37:10.807
Before, Brady.

37:10.808 --> 37:13.778
Oh.
Yeah, sure.

37:17.516 --> 37:19.917
Hugo, when I was
really young,

37:19.918 --> 37:23.988
my brother was reckless
and I lost him for a long time.

37:23.989 --> 37:25.723
You just got Brady
into your life.

37:25.724 --> 37:27.726
Why would you wanna
be reckless with that?

37:32.231 --> 37:33.964
Oh.

37:33.965 --> 37:35.833
Right.

37:35.834 --> 37:37.802
Hey.

37:42.207 --> 37:45.610
My great-great grandfather
worked with Scott Joplin.

37:45.611 --> 37:47.979
Joplin left him
this cigarette case,

37:47.980 --> 37:50.548
said it made him feel life
more fully.

37:50.549 --> 37:52.851
That's what he put
in his music.

37:52.852 --> 37:55.921
So you thought the case was
a shortcut to inspired music?

37:55.922 --> 37:57.122
I was helping myself.

37:57.123 --> 37:59.358
But those people,
I-I helped them too.

37:59.359 --> 38:01.360
People have the right
to work through their pain

38:01.361 --> 38:04.862
on their own terms,
heal themselves.

38:04.863 --> 38:06.597
You have to learn how
to live your own life, Ethan.

38:06.598 --> 38:07.899
I'm 27.

38:07.900 --> 38:09.300
It's a good time to go,
you know?

38:09.301 --> 38:11.302
My... my music would live on.

38:11.337 --> 38:13.438
Morrison, Hendrix,
Janis Joplin,

38:13.439 --> 38:17.410
Cobain, Winehouse, it's...
It's good company.

38:17.411 --> 38:19.245
It's selfish.

38:19.246 --> 38:22.248
How dare you just decide
to leave

38:22.249 --> 38:24.451
without thinking about
the people in your life?

38:24.452 --> 38:28.087
The people who...
Who love you.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.389
Like who?

38:30.390 --> 38:32.558
Okay, you're not
just selfish.

38:32.559 --> 38:34.626
You're also blind.

38:38.464 --> 38:40.465
You like... you like me?

38:40.466 --> 38:42.300
I mean, I like...
I like you.

38:42.301 --> 38:43.634
I just didn't think...

38:43.669 --> 38:45.236
Ugh.

38:45.237 --> 38:49.307
Musicians.

38:49.308 --> 38:51.609
Okay, there's some
life experience

38:51.610 --> 38:53.578
waitin' for you right there.

38:53.579 --> 38:55.446
I figured it out last week.

38:55.447 --> 38:58.850
Whenever I get hurt,
Claudia feels the pain.

38:58.851 --> 39:01.047
The metronome might
keep my alive, but...

39:01.053 --> 39:04.889
But if something terrible
happens to you,

39:04.890 --> 39:08.393
it happens to Claudia too?

39:08.394 --> 39:10.428
And there had to be a price
for Claudia bringing me back,

39:10.429 --> 39:14.332
but I won't let Claudia
pay with her own life.

39:14.333 --> 39:17.635
Well, what does she think
about all this?

39:21.040 --> 39:24.642
You haven't talked
to her yet.

39:24.643 --> 39:26.277
If I tell her,
she'll just stop me

39:26.278 --> 39:27.678
from doing what I have to do.

39:27.679 --> 39:30.181
And you and I both know
that taking myself

39:30.182 --> 39:31.416
off the metronome might be
the only way

39:31.417 --> 39:32.684
to keep Claudia safe.

39:32.685 --> 39:34.519
What I know is that
I've lost

39:34.520 --> 39:35.954
too many people
that I care about.

39:35.955 --> 39:38.123
Sam died.
Dickenson died.

39:38.124 --> 39:40.325
H.G. is God knows where.

39:40.326 --> 39:41.793
I know.
I know.

39:41.794 --> 39:44.529
I found your body
in that hangar.

39:44.530 --> 39:46.364
I won't go
through that again.

39:46.365 --> 39:47.832
There's another solution.

39:47.833 --> 39:49.534
There... there has to be.

39:49.535 --> 39:50.702
I don't see what.

39:50.703 --> 39:52.503
Well, you haven't really
looked yet.

39:52.504 --> 39:55.039
Maybe it's time to start.

39:59.939 --> 40:03.241
Ethan started getting better
once we neutralized the case.

40:03.242 --> 40:05.077
Though the sorrow and pain

40:05.078 --> 40:08.279
returned to everyone
that he'd affected.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.582
Well, now they can
start to heal.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.954
Uh, speaking of that, Artie,

40:15.989 --> 40:18.624
I need to spend some time
close to home.

40:18.625 --> 40:22.561
Skip a few missions and
just focus on processing,

40:22.562 --> 40:24.997
learn more about the metronome,
how it works.

40:24.998 --> 40:26.398
Take all the time you need.

40:26.399 --> 40:28.567
Thanks.

40:33.540 --> 40:34.807
[Imitating horn]

40:34.808 --> 40:36.308
Success,
artifact retrieved,

40:36.309 --> 40:38.177
crisis averted, day saved.

40:38.178 --> 40:40.279
Good job.
Bragging is unbecoming.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.080
Since when?

40:42.081 --> 40:43.782
'Sup, Jinksy?

40:43.783 --> 40:45.117
Why are you wearing
a serious face?

40:45.118 --> 40:48.120
I keep telling you guys,
this is just my face.

40:48.121 --> 40:49.689
- I'm contemplative.
- I don't know.

40:49.690 --> 40:51.891
I'd say it's more
"constipatetive."

40:51.892 --> 40:53.192
That's not a word.

40:53.193 --> 40:55.227
I have something to make you
contemplate a smile,

40:55.228 --> 40:56.395
<i>Revenge</i> on TiVo.

40:56.396 --> 40:58.464
Why does everyone
keep trying

40:58.465 --> 40:59.799
to get me to watch
that show?

40:59.800 --> 41:01.601
Hello, Artemis.

41:01.602 --> 41:04.103
One artifacts.

41:04.104 --> 41:05.939
- Pete?
- Yeah?

41:05.940 --> 41:07.573
How... how did Claudia do?

41:07.574 --> 41:09.743
Oh. [Exhales]
Scary, actually.

41:09.744 --> 41:11.711
Scary?

41:14.315 --> 41:16.983
What do you mean?
How scary, evil?

41:16.984 --> 41:19.553
No, Artie,
scary what a strong,

41:19.554 --> 41:21.055
powerful woman
she's grown into.

41:21.056 --> 41:22.790
I mean, uh,
Hugo said it himself,

41:22.791 --> 41:24.892
"she's a force
to be reckoned with."

41:24.893 --> 41:26.394
No, you'd be...
You'd be proud.

41:26.395 --> 41:28.463
That's good.
It's all good.

41:28.464 --> 41:29.764
And wh... any trouble?

41:29.765 --> 41:31.799
Oh, yeah, pfft,
nothing we couldn't handle.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.701
I mean, sure,
it took us some time,

41:33.702 --> 41:36.471
but we retrieved all
the marbles, gooed the bag.

41:36.472 --> 41:37.772
Kids are all right,
yada, yada, yada.

41:37.806 --> 41:39.974
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.175
Marbles?

41:41.176 --> 41:46.114
Yeah.

41:46.115 --> 41:48.382
Bobby Fischer's marbles.

41:48.383 --> 41:50.051
Yeah, yeah they showed up
on Hugo's doorstep.

41:50.052 --> 41:55.490
Good thing too, because
that is one bad sack of...

41:55.491 --> 41:58.626
Artie?

41:58.627 --> 42:00.895
Dismantled my life's work.

42:00.896 --> 42:03.131
What?

42:03.132 --> 42:04.866
Uh, nothing.

42:04.867 --> 42:06.968
Nothing, but good job.

42:06.969 --> 42:08.136
You go get some rest.

42:08.137 --> 42:09.805
I'll catch you later.

42:09.806 --> 42:11.840
Okay.

42:11.841 --> 42:13.909
[Door closes]

42:17.547 --> 42:20.749
No, please, no.

42:20.750 --> 42:22.585
[Beeping]

42:22.586 --> 42:24.554
No.

42:28.925 --> 42:32.228
Adrian: Things have already
been set in motion.

42:35.132 --> 42:37.100
No!
