        (car horn toots)        

00:35.900 --> 00:37.700
      (theme song begins)       

00:39.100 --> 00:41.400
  ¶ Sometimes you want to go    

00:41.500 --> 00:45.300
    ¶ Where everybody           
    knows your name ¶           

00:47.200 --> 00:51.800
      ¶ And they're always      
        glad you came ¶         

00:51.900 --> 00:54.100
         ¶ You wanna be         
      where you can see ¶

00:56.700 --> 01:01.000
      ¶ You wanna be where      
  everybody knows your name. ¶  

01:19.000 --> 01:20.400
                All right, okay,
                     here's one.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.800
        Hayley Mills, playing   
     herself and her twin sister

01:22.900 --> 01:24.700
             in <i>The Parent Trap.</i>

01:24.700 --> 01:25.900
     All right, all right.      

01:25.900 --> 01:27.300
            Um, how             
about Elizabeth Montgomery      

01:27.300 --> 01:29.500
  as both Serena and Samantha   
         in <i>Bewitched?</i>          

01:29.500 --> 01:30.600
                 Ooh! Very nice!
Yeah. Yeah.                     

01:30.600 --> 01:32.000
                      All right.
                         Cliffy?

01:32.100 --> 01:35.400
Well, uh, Norm, I'd have to say 
  the, uh, queen of the genre,  

01:35.400 --> 01:39.100
 Patty Duke, as both Patty and, 
  uh, the minuet-lovin' Cathy.  

01:39.100 --> 01:39.900
                        FRASIER:
                             Oh!

01:40.000 --> 01:41.300
What's the topic du jour?       

01:41.300 --> 01:43.100
Actresses who have played       
their own look-alikes           

01:43.200 --> 01:44.900
through the use                 
of trick photography?           

01:44.900 --> 01:46.600
             No. Fictional twins
                we'd like to see

01:46.700 --> 01:48.100
                      making out
                with each other.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.300
WOODY:                          
Hey, Sam,                       

01:50.300 --> 01:52.500
                  the new Boston
                Merchants coupon
                    book is out,

01:52.600 --> 01:54.100
and I got us in it.             

01:54.100 --> 01:55.800
              Oh damn it, Woody!

01:55.800 --> 01:57.500
              I hate that thing!

01:57.500 --> 02:00.100
Well, maybe you don't           
understand how it works.        
                     Yeah, I do.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.700
            Guy comes in,       
         gives you a coupon.    

02:01.800 --> 02:03.800
     You give him a free drink, 
             he leaves,         

02:03.900 --> 02:05.200
     you never see him again.   

02:05.300 --> 02:07.000
Well, then                      
you do understand.              

02:08.800 --> 02:10.800
        Woody...                

02:10.800 --> 02:12.400
                Well, what, Sam?

02:12.500 --> 02:14.300
                    You think it
                 was a bad idea?

02:14.300 --> 02:16.400
        You think I shouldn't   
                have done it?   

02:16.400 --> 02:18.500
          You think I'm a stupid
                idiot, right?   

02:18.500 --> 02:20.700
No, no, that's... Yes!          

02:20.700 --> 02:23.000
                      Well, I...
                 I'm sorry, Sam.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.300
            I just thought it   
                would attract   

02:24.300 --> 02:25.900
                new customers   
                     to the bar.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.000
Yeah, a-a bunch of              
deadbeats and freeloaders.      

02:28.000 --> 02:29.500
                        NORM:   
                        Yeah.   

02:29.500 --> 02:32.200
        You don't want people   
              like that in here.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.100
                Another beer,   
                please, Wood.   

02:35.100 --> 02:37.000
 Sam, that was John Allen Hill  
         on the phone.          

02:37.000 --> 02:38.900
    He's on his way down.       
SAM:                            
No, no.                         

02:38.900 --> 02:41.100
  I don't want to talk to him.  
        I hate that guy.        

02:41.100 --> 02:42.600
     Sam, be a good businessman.
     He's our upstairs neighbor.

02:42.700 --> 02:43.800
                      We have to
                  live together.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.400
                  Just try to be
                civil to him.   

02:45.400 --> 02:47.900
All right, all right, all right,
  I'll be good. I'll be good.   

02:47.900 --> 02:49.300
  You know, I get the feeling   
        sometimes               

02:49.400 --> 02:50.600
  he deliberately says things   
          just 'cause           

02:50.600 --> 02:52.300
      he knows it's gonna       
    get under my skin.          

02:52.300 --> 02:53.600
              Sam!              

02:53.600 --> 02:55.000
          See? God...           

02:55.000 --> 02:57.300
Sam, it appears                 
we have a problem.              

02:57.300 --> 02:58.600
Do you know what this is?       

02:58.700 --> 03:00.200
            Yeah. Yeah, it looks
                like a manicure.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.400
                  Nice one, too.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.600
              Wait. Is that a...

03:02.600 --> 03:04.900
        Is that clear polish,   
        or are they just buffed?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.100
They're just clean.             

03:07.100 --> 03:08.300
Sam, I'm concerned.             

03:08.400 --> 03:12.200
Are you aware that your bar     
is featured in this coupon book?

03:12.300 --> 03:14.400
                     Yeah, I am.
Well, my concern                

03:14.400 --> 03:15.700
is how this will                
affect Melville's.              

03:15.700 --> 03:18.200
I'm not anxious                 
to greet the type of person     

03:18.300 --> 03:20.900
you're obviously                
hoping to attract.              

03:21.000 --> 03:21.900
            What are you saying?

03:21.900 --> 03:23.500
                 You saying that
          you're better than me?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.200
         That your customers are
             classier than mine?

03:25.200 --> 03:26.600
              Well, they're not.
                        NORM:   
                     Hey, Sammy?

03:26.700 --> 03:28.700
            Will you settle a   
             bet for us, please?

03:28.700 --> 03:31.200
        Which one of our breaths
          smells most like tuna?

03:31.200 --> 03:32.600
         Loser has to go through
        the spanking machine.   

03:32.700 --> 03:35.500
          What do you want me to
        do, walk over and check?

03:35.500 --> 03:37.400
I can tell you from here.       

03:39.000 --> 03:40.200
                    Oh, yeah,   
                right, right.   

03:40.200 --> 03:42.300
      And none of your customers
                have fish breath

03:42.300 --> 03:44.500
          when they come walking
         out of your restaurant?

03:44.600 --> 03:46.900
It's a seafood                  
restaurant, Sam.                

03:47.000 --> 03:49.300
            Ah, all right, so   
            you admit it, right?

03:49.300 --> 03:51.400
                      (grunting)

03:53.400 --> 03:56.600
Well, looks like                
the big boy lost.               

03:59.200 --> 04:01.100
        Hi, guys.               

04:01.100 --> 04:03.100
            Hey, Carla, I got   
              a message for you.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.400
            Your brother called.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.500
                 Something about
            a family meeting.   

04:06.500 --> 04:08.800
Oh, yeah?                       

04:08.800 --> 04:10.300
There!                          

04:10.300 --> 04:11.500
                      Uh, here's
                your message.   

04:11.600 --> 04:13.000
        That was my paycheck.   

04:18.399 --> 04:20.200
      Carla, what's the problem?
        Why are you so upset?   

04:20.300 --> 04:22.300
  Oh, I hate family meetings.   

04:22.300 --> 04:25.300
  They're nothing but a bunch   
 of complaining and infighting  

04:25.300 --> 04:27.500
and bickering and backstabbing. 

04:27.600 --> 04:29.100
        And, of course,         

04:29.100 --> 04:31.400
     sweet little Carla has     
    to play the peacemaker.     

04:31.500 --> 04:33.000
                        FRASIER:
                        Well,   

04:33.000 --> 04:35.100
I, for one, think               
family meetings                 

04:35.100 --> 04:36.700
can be worthwhile               
encounters.                     

04:36.700 --> 04:38.400
They encourage open             
and honest communication        

04:38.500 --> 04:39.800
among the generations.          

04:39.800 --> 04:42.100
            Did you have them   
                  in your family
                    there, Fras?

04:42.100 --> 04:43.300
No, I lucked out.               

04:43.300 --> 04:45.700
My family didn't want           
to be close.                    

04:45.700 --> 04:50.000
If you're lying to me, I'm gonna
rip out your slimy, gray tongue.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.100
                        Whoa.   

04:51.200 --> 04:52.600
                     Sounds kind
                     of serious.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.400
                 It's my mother.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.100
Well, what's the matter         
with her?                       

04:56.100 --> 04:57.900
              She had the dream.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.600
What dream's that?              

04:59.600 --> 05:00.800
                The death dream.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.700
             Whenever someone in
            my family has it,   

05:02.700 --> 05:05.700
              you can just start
        divvying up the jewelry.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.300
REBECCA:                        
What exactly                    

05:07.300 --> 05:09.700
is this... death dream?         

05:09.800 --> 05:11.400
                        FRASIER:
                            Yes,

05:11.400 --> 05:15.900
      and, uh, why exactly      
    do you always do this...    

05:16.000 --> 05:21.200
         when you say,          
    "the death dream?"          

05:21.200 --> 05:23.900
                You just did it.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.900
        Carry on.               

05:28.200 --> 05:31.500
                 Well, the dream
             is always the same.

05:31.500 --> 05:36.500
      There's a casket on a slab
            in an empty room.   

05:36.500 --> 05:39.000
      You walk slowly toward it.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.900
                Suddenly, the   
                 lid flies open.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.300
                    You see your
                    own face?   

05:43.400 --> 05:44.600
         No, you see these feet,

05:44.700 --> 05:46.600
        'cause you're looking   
            at the wrong end.   

05:48.000 --> 05:50.100
     Then, you look upward,     

05:50.100 --> 05:52.100
and there's your own face,      

05:52.100 --> 05:54.700
        pale and bluish         
  with pennies over your eyes.  

05:54.700 --> 05:57.200
  And that's when you bolt up   
    in bed screaming.           

05:57.300 --> 05:58.600
                        FRASIER:
                          Carla,

05:58.700 --> 06:00.300
death is an earthly             
scientific passage              

06:00.300 --> 06:02.900
predicted by either massive     
physical injury                 

06:02.900 --> 06:04.900
or progressive                  
bodily deterioration.           

06:05.000 --> 06:08.800
There is as little validity     
in a supposed death dream       

06:08.800 --> 06:10.200
                        as there
                    is in the...

06:10.300 --> 06:13.600
 clichéd image of death itself  
as a grim, bloodless ghoul      

06:13.700 --> 06:15.500
 whose bony finger reaches out  

06:15.600 --> 06:17.100
      to tap you on the shoulder
          when your number's up.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.300
    Frasier, it's time          
             to go.             

06:19.300 --> 06:20.400
        (screams)               

06:24.700 --> 06:26.300
     Don't do that, woman!      

06:26.300 --> 06:28.600
    For God's sakes,            

06:28.600 --> 06:29.800
         put on some blush or...

06:34.900 --> 06:36.500
                            SAM:
                          Honey,

06:36.500 --> 06:37.300
              it's kind of slow.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.800
            Why-Why don't you   
            take the day off,   

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
go see your mom, huh?           

06:39.800 --> 06:40.800
                  Might I remind
                      you, Sam--

06:40.800 --> 06:42.600
                 my mother and I
        don't exactly get along.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.200
      You don't get along       
         with anybody.          

06:44.200 --> 06:46.700
             Yeah, well, this is
         different, and shut up!

06:48.400 --> 06:51.300
  The last time I saw my mother,
      we had this terrible fight

06:51.400 --> 06:53.100
            about this stupid   
                family thing,   

06:53.100 --> 06:55.200
                and I swore I   
            would never set foot

06:55.200 --> 06:56.800
    in her lousy place again    

06:56.800 --> 07:00.000
unless someone dragged me there 
     kicking and screaming.     

07:00.000 --> 07:01.200
So, that's it, huh?             

07:01.200 --> 07:03.100
            You're damned right.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.600
(clicks tongue)                 

07:05.600 --> 07:07.700
        Drag me, Sammy.         

07:07.700 --> 07:09.700
            Really?             

07:09.800 --> 07:12.500
        Do it. Drag me.         

07:12.600 --> 07:13.800
      No! No! Cut it out!       

07:13.900 --> 07:15.300
      I don't want to go!       

07:15.300 --> 07:18.300
     No! No! I never want to see
that shriveled old bag again!   

07:22.500 --> 07:23.800
                No! Put me down!

07:23.800 --> 07:25.400
                         I don't
                     want to go!

07:25.400 --> 07:27.700
    Oh, Carla, Carla!           

07:27.800 --> 07:30.900
                Oh, nobody would
         believe you would come!

07:31.000 --> 07:33.500
                 Oh, your sister
                is in there with
                your mother now,

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
                      and you go
                      next, yes?

07:35.500 --> 07:38.000
              Oh, she will be so
            happy to see you.   

07:38.100 --> 07:39.400
                     Carla!     
                    (laughs)    

07:39.400 --> 07:41.900
Sam, you remember Zia,          
the hugger.                     

07:41.900 --> 07:42.500
Yeah.                           

07:42.600 --> 07:43.600
            Oh, Sam!            

07:43.600 --> 07:44.900
Oh!                             

07:44.900 --> 07:46.500
MAN:                            
You guys                        

07:46.500 --> 07:47.800
          want a beer?          

07:47.900 --> 07:50.700
        This is kind of         
    a solemn occasion, Sal.     

07:50.800 --> 07:52.400
Malt liquor?                    

07:52.500 --> 07:54.300
        I'll pass.              

07:56.100 --> 07:57.800
             So, Zia, how's Mom?

07:57.800 --> 08:01.400
Carla, what kind                
of question is that?            

08:01.400 --> 08:02.600
She had the dream.              

08:03.900 --> 08:05.200
  So, she's really sick, huh?   

08:05.200 --> 08:07.000
                 No. She doesn't
                have to be sick.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.300
              She had the dream.
    Oh...                       

08:08.400 --> 08:09.600
                    She'll be   
                      dead soon.

08:09.700 --> 08:10.700
      Have you had lunch?       

08:12.600 --> 08:15.000
Uh, actually, yeah, I did.      

08:15.000 --> 08:16.400
                Oh, then this   
                      is dinner.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.500
     Oh, hey, thanks, Zia.      

08:18.500 --> 08:21.100
    Eat up, Sam.                
 Our family believes in,        

08:21.100 --> 08:22.600
  life is for the living.       

08:22.600 --> 08:23.800
          (laughs)              

08:23.800 --> 08:25.300
        Soon enough,            
     we'll all be dead,         

08:25.400 --> 08:28.600
    rotting in the ground,      
 with a mouth full of worms.    

08:30.900 --> 08:32.700
                 Great linguini.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.400
        Thank you, Zia.         

08:34.400 --> 08:36.600
Oh, Carla,                      
your sister's finished.         

08:36.700 --> 08:38.500
             Bitch.             

08:38.500 --> 08:39.900
          Slut.                 

08:39.900 --> 08:42.100
    Oh, it's nice               
    to see them talking.        

08:56.100 --> 08:57.500
             Mama.              

08:57.500 --> 08:59.200
                    Angeline?   

08:59.300 --> 09:01.400
No, Mama.                       

09:01.400 --> 09:03.000
It's Carla.                     

09:03.100 --> 09:04.600
                          Oh.   

09:04.600 --> 09:07.200
                     My purse is
                 on the dresser.

09:10.900 --> 09:14.000
    Mama, I didn't come here    
        for your money.         

09:22.600 --> 09:24.600
I came because                  
I feel bad                      

09:24.700 --> 09:28.000
things got so ugly between us   
the last time I was here.       

09:28.000 --> 09:30.700
              So, you've come to
            say you're sorry.   

09:30.700 --> 09:33.900
Well, I'm sorry we fought.      

09:33.900 --> 09:35.800
              Then you're sorry.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.400
          I accept your apology.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.300
         Good. I accept         
    your apology, too.          

09:39.400 --> 09:40.800
                    I didn't say
                    I was sorry.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.400
Well, then,                     
I'm not sorry, either.          

09:42.400 --> 09:44.500
             Too late. I already
          accepted your apology.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.700
        Damn!                   

09:47.700 --> 09:49.800
So, here...                     

09:49.800 --> 09:53.100
now that we've made peace,      

09:53.100 --> 09:55.200
  I want you to have the ring   

09:55.200 --> 09:57.000
that my mother gave to me,      

09:57.000 --> 09:58.400
and her mother                  

09:58.400 --> 10:00.300
          gave to her.          

10:00.400 --> 10:02.100
      Oh, Mama. The ring.       

10:03.500 --> 10:05.600
                    What's this?

10:05.700 --> 10:07.600
I hocked it.                    

10:09.900 --> 10:11.700
    Come.                       

10:18.300 --> 10:20.300
Oh, your father's hair.         

10:26.500 --> 10:28.100
                     Sorry, Mom.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.200
And now, Carla,                 

10:30.300 --> 10:33.100
there is something              
you must do for me.             

10:33.100 --> 10:36.700
        Oh, Mama, I know what   
            you're gonna ask me.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.800
            We're just gonna get
            into that same fight

10:38.800 --> 10:40.900
                 we had the last
                time I was here.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.800
            I... It... It's just
                too much to ask.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.200
                  I can't do it.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.000
It's the family tradition.      

10:47.000 --> 10:48.300
                    No.         

10:48.300 --> 10:49.800
      I did it.                 

10:49.800 --> 10:51.200
My mother did it.               

10:51.300 --> 10:52.500
  Her mother did it.            

10:52.500 --> 10:54.200
 Her mother did it              
 before her.                    

10:54.300 --> 10:55.400
                    I said no.  

10:55.400 --> 10:56.900
                    I don't care
                     who did it.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.600
    Her mother did it.          

11:00.900 --> 11:02.600
                Mama, I'm sorry.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.600
  I'm sorry you had the dream.  

11:04.600 --> 11:06.200
  I'm sorry you're gonna die.   

11:06.300 --> 11:09.600
 I'm sorry the family tradition 
     is gonna die with you.     

11:09.700 --> 11:11.700
                But that is just
                  the way it is.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.600
  I can't do this for anybody,  
     not even for my mama.      

11:15.600 --> 11:17.700
    Her mother did it.          

11:20.000 --> 11:22.100
                    Oh...       

11:22.100 --> 11:24.300
    What's the matter, honey?   

11:24.400 --> 11:26.200
    Oh, Sammy, Sammy.           

11:26.200 --> 11:30.800
        It's this stupid        
    family tradition.           

11:30.800 --> 11:35.000
Since the beginning of time,    
every woman in our family...    

11:35.000 --> 11:36.500
      who has children...       

11:41.700 --> 11:44.000
...has named                    
one of her sons                 

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
with the first name             
of her father                   

11:46.000 --> 11:47.600
and the maiden name             
of her mother.                  

11:47.600 --> 11:48.900
And I just wouldn't do it.      

11:50.000 --> 11:51.900
            I don't mean to take
        your mother's side here,

11:51.900 --> 11:53.000
                      but what's
                the big deal?   

11:53.100 --> 11:54.200
            It's just a name.   

11:54.200 --> 11:56.300
        Oh, yeah, sure,         
          just a name.          

11:56.400 --> 11:58.900
          Why, uh, what was your
            father's first name?

11:58.900 --> 12:01.100
    Benito.                     

12:01.200 --> 12:02.800
            And your mother's   
                    maiden name?

12:02.900 --> 12:04.800
    Mussolini.                  

12:12.300 --> 12:14.600
                     Yikes.     

12:14.600 --> 12:17.000
            Could I have some   
             more sauce, please?

12:18.100 --> 12:20.100
         (Mama moaning)         

12:20.200 --> 12:21.700
ZIA (gasps):                    
The death walk.                 

12:21.700 --> 12:23.000
            She's still here.   

12:23.000 --> 12:27.700
             I feel her presence
        like a shiv in my heart.

12:27.700 --> 12:30.700
             Mama.              

12:30.700 --> 12:31.900
I'm not rejecting you.          

12:31.900 --> 12:34.900
I just don't want to name       
one of my sons Benito Mussolini.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.400
                  Why not?      

12:36.400 --> 12:38.700
Because, back a few years,      

12:38.700 --> 12:41.200
there was another               
Benito Mussolini.               

12:41.200 --> 12:42.300
Remember him?                   

12:42.300 --> 12:44.300
             I don't see why one
                Fascist dictator

12:44.400 --> 12:47.100
              should ruin it for
              the entire family.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.600
Mama, you are the only one      
who even cares                  

12:50.700 --> 12:52.100
about that stupid name.         

12:52.200 --> 12:54.300
     Everybody else agrees      
        with me, right?         

12:54.400 --> 12:55.800
Oh, you're                      
an ungrateful child.            

12:55.900 --> 12:57.100
            You make me sick.   

12:58.500 --> 12:59.700
             Bitch.             

13:04.400 --> 13:06.000
        Okay.                   

13:06.000 --> 13:08.500
Well, just forget all of you.   

13:08.600 --> 13:09.700
      I hate this family.       

13:09.700 --> 13:11.000
    I hate this house.          

13:11.000 --> 13:14.200
    I just never want           
    to come back here again.    

13:14.200 --> 13:15.100
          I swear it.           

13:15.100 --> 13:16.900
  I swear it a million times.   

13:16.900 --> 13:20.400
 I swear on my children's eyes, 
     I am never, ever, <i>ever</i>     

13:20.400 --> 13:23.800
  setting foot in this stupid,  
 ugly, stinkin' rattrap again.  

13:33.800 --> 13:35.800
Well, there goes my ride.       

13:46.900 --> 13:48.100
 How can her mother expect her  

13:48.100 --> 13:50.500
    to name one of her kids     
    after Benito Mussolini?     

13:50.500 --> 13:52.500
Well, it could                  
have been worse.                

13:52.600 --> 13:54.300
What if her father's name       
had been Adolf?                 

13:54.300 --> 13:55.500
             Yeah.              

13:55.500 --> 13:56.500
Yeah, and her mother's          
maiden name                     

13:56.500 --> 13:58.400
could have been Menjou.         

14:00.500 --> 14:02.500
    Phew.                       

14:02.600 --> 14:05.600
She really dodged               
the bullet there.               

14:06.800 --> 14:08.000
 Anyway, I gave her the day off 

14:08.100 --> 14:10.100
so she could just go home       
    and cool out, you know.     

14:10.100 --> 14:11.100
                Well, very often

14:11.200 --> 14:12.500
that's the best thing           
you can do                      

14:12.500 --> 14:14.600
when you're not getting along   
with a family member.           

14:14.600 --> 14:16.100
Remove yourself                 
entirely from them.             

14:16.100 --> 14:17.700
Find some neutral place         

14:17.700 --> 14:20.300
where you can take the time     
you need to be away from them.  

14:20.400 --> 14:21.800
                      You really
                 think so, Fras?

14:21.800 --> 14:23.500
Well, that's...                 

14:23.500 --> 14:25.700
that's why we're                
all here, isn't it?             

14:28.300 --> 14:29.400
            Thank you very much.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.700
                    Great.      

14:30.700 --> 14:32.800
             Four more freebies,

14:32.800 --> 14:35.400
    thanks to Woody's           
      stupid coupon book.       

14:39.100 --> 14:40.300
    I'm sorry, Woody.           

14:40.300 --> 14:42.200
    I didn't see you there.     

14:44.900 --> 14:46.600
Of course I'm there.            

14:46.700 --> 14:48.500
I'm always there.               

14:48.500 --> 14:50.500
Wherever there's                
a stupid idea,                  

14:50.500 --> 14:52.000
that's where                    
you'll find me.                 

14:52.000 --> 14:55.200
Stupid old Woody Boyd--         

14:55.200 --> 14:56.800
father of stupid thoughts,      

14:56.900 --> 14:59.800
eye of the stupid storm.        

14:59.900 --> 15:02.900
I've got to be the stupidest guy
on the face of the Earth.       

15:03.100 --> 15:05.200
                Woody, please   
                 don't say that.
     Why not?                   

15:05.300 --> 15:08.300
          Because you are giving
        me a stupid headache.   

15:08.400 --> 15:09.900
  Welcome to my private hell.   

15:14.500 --> 15:16.400
            Hi, Sam.            

15:16.500 --> 15:18.300
How are you doing, honey?       
Better.                         

15:18.400 --> 15:19.700
          I went home,          

15:19.800 --> 15:21.600
      went to my bedroom,       
    shut off all the lights     

15:21.700 --> 15:23.700
    and laid down on my bed.    

15:23.700 --> 15:27.500
  Then... I started thinking.   

15:27.600 --> 15:29.900
      What if I was dying       
and Serafina refused to do      

15:29.900 --> 15:31.700
         the one thing          
that meant the most to me.      

15:31.800 --> 15:33.000
    How would I feel?           

15:33.000 --> 15:35.300
            So you apologized   
                 to your mother?

15:35.300 --> 15:38.600
              No. I went out and
             yelled at Serafina.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.500
            I felt a lot better.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.800
      So I went and yelled      
  at all the rest of the kids.  

15:42.800 --> 15:44.300
        Then I started thinking,

15:44.300 --> 15:46.000
                 why should I be
             having all this fun

15:46.100 --> 15:47.500
      when my mom's dying?      

15:47.500 --> 15:51.300
So I decided I had to try       
    to do something for her.    

15:51.300 --> 15:54.400
Well, I've got a bunch          
of these coupon books left.     

15:54.500 --> 15:57.200
They're only good               
for a month,                    

15:57.200 --> 15:59.900
but I guess in her case,        
that doesn't matter.            

16:02.000 --> 16:03.900
                 Anyway, all the
                kids were there,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.800
        so I figured it wouldn't
                hurt to ask them

16:05.800 --> 16:08.600
if anyone would fulfill their   
        grandmother's dying wish

16:08.700 --> 16:11.800
        and change their name   
            to Benito Mussolini.

16:11.800 --> 16:12.900
                Any takers?     

16:12.900 --> 16:13.900
                        No.     

16:13.900 --> 16:16.600
          But I got two Madonnas
            and an MC Hammer.   

16:16.700 --> 16:18.100
                    Well,       

16:18.100 --> 16:19.100
          that's that.          

16:19.200 --> 16:21.000
I tried everything I can.       

16:21.000 --> 16:24.500
She didn't try                  
the coupons.                    

16:24.500 --> 16:25.700
              Sam?              

16:25.800 --> 16:28.300
                  God, I hate it
              when he says that.

16:28.300 --> 16:31.400
 What? What? What're you gonna  
    nitpick this time?          

16:31.500 --> 16:33.100
  What, am I mixing my drinks   
        too loud?               

16:33.100 --> 16:34.900
Am I using the wrong kind       
         of lightbulb?          

16:35.000 --> 16:37.400
            Oh, excuse me, maybe
              some of my bar air

16:37.400 --> 16:40.200
          accidentally wafted up
          to your establishment.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.900
Sam, you're on                  
the defensive.                  

16:43.000 --> 16:44.800
    I'm not on the defensive,   
         and you say that again,

16:44.800 --> 16:47.200
         I'm gonna pull the last
      three hairs off your head.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.400
Sam, I merely came down         
to apologize                    

16:50.500 --> 16:53.600
for my intrusive                
behavior earlier today.         

16:53.600 --> 16:55.000
                    Really?     

16:55.000 --> 16:56.400
    Yes.                        

16:56.400 --> 16:57.900
I know I'd be resentful         
if someone implied              

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
that I should run my business   
in a particular way.            

17:00.100 --> 17:02.700
It was out of line              
for me to do so with you.       

17:02.800 --> 17:03.900
                      Oh.       

17:03.900 --> 17:05.700
              Well... thank you.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.400
                 I'm sorry, I am
             a little defensive.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.400
Well, no harm done.             

17:09.400 --> 17:11.300
In fact, to clear the air,      

17:11.300 --> 17:13.800
I'd like to buy a round         
of drinks for everyone here.    

17:13.800 --> 17:16.400
        (cheering)              

17:16.500 --> 17:19.200
       Here you are, Sam.       

17:19.300 --> 17:22.200
 I think this should cover it.  

17:22.300 --> 17:24.800
        Oh, and I'd like        
  one of your special martinis  

17:24.800 --> 17:27.200
I've heard so much about.       

17:27.300 --> 17:30.400
    Oh, I'm out of coupons.     

17:30.400 --> 17:33.100
    Well, then, never mind.     

17:35.000 --> 17:36.600
            Hey, Ma.            

17:36.600 --> 17:38.700
 Gino, what are you doing here? 

17:38.700 --> 17:40.100
Well, Ma, I was thinking about  
all that stuff you said,        

17:40.200 --> 17:42.200
you know about-about            
making Grandma happy,           

17:42.300 --> 17:45.000
and I was talking it over       
with MC and the Madonnas,       

17:45.000 --> 17:47.300
and I figured, heck,            

17:47.400 --> 17:49.400
if it'll keep                   
this family together,           

17:49.500 --> 17:50.900
someone's gotta do it.          

17:50.900 --> 17:55.000
Ma, I'll be Benito Mussolini.   

17:55.000 --> 17:57.200
                  Look, Gino,   

17:57.300 --> 18:00.400
            do you even have any
         idea who Mussolini was?

18:00.400 --> 18:02.300
Well, no, I didn't before,      

18:02.400 --> 18:04.100
but then Anthony told me        
all about him.                  

18:04.100 --> 18:06.200
Ma, this guy                    
ran this whole country.         

18:06.200 --> 18:08.500
And do you know                 
what they called him?           

18:08.600 --> 18:10.400
They called him <i>Il Duce.</i>        

18:10.400 --> 18:12.700
Huh? The Dooch.                 

18:13.500 --> 18:16.100
Hey, yeah, that's right.        

18:16.100 --> 18:18.600
It's me-- Dooch Tortelli.       

18:20.000 --> 18:21.600
        That is a horrible name,

18:21.700 --> 18:23.200
                and I never want
            to hear it again.   

18:23.200 --> 18:24.300
                It sounds awful.
        (phone ringing)         

18:24.300 --> 18:26.200
            I hate that name,   
                 and I hate Mama

18:26.300 --> 18:28.000
                for asking me   
              to give it to you.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.100
             Okay.              

18:29.200 --> 18:30.200
 Carla, that was your brother.  

18:30.300 --> 18:31.900
He said to get over there       
          right away.           

18:31.900 --> 18:32.900
Your mother's going fast.       

18:33.900 --> 18:36.300
                      No.       

18:36.300 --> 18:38.500
    I swore I'd never go back   
            in that house again.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.900
                I have my pride.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.800
             Okay.              

18:41.900 --> 18:44.300
 Gino, want to grab her feet--  
I'll get the rest of her.       

18:44.400 --> 18:47.300
Come here, come here,           
come on, come on, come on.      

18:47.400 --> 18:49.100
      No! No! Put me down!      

18:49.100 --> 18:50.700
          Put me down!          
      I don't want to go!       

18:50.800 --> 18:52.500
    Would you hoist me          
     a little higher, guys?     

18:52.500 --> 18:55.700
I'd like to have some butt left 
    when I get there.           

19:06.500 --> 19:07.800
            Oh, no.             

19:07.900 --> 19:09.400
         I'm too late.          

19:14.900 --> 19:16.800
Oh, Mama.                       

19:16.800 --> 19:18.700
Oh, Mama, I'm sorry.            

19:18.700 --> 19:22.600
Please forgive me.              

19:22.600 --> 19:25.000
I hope you can hear me.         

19:25.000 --> 19:28.200
I hope you can rest now.        

19:28.300 --> 19:29.800
    I swear                     

19:29.800 --> 19:31.300
        on your memory,         

19:31.400 --> 19:35.100
that my Gino is now named       

19:35.100 --> 19:37.300
Benito Mussolini.               

19:37.400 --> 19:39.100
          Well, it's about time.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.300
    I was getting bedsores.     

19:43.300 --> 19:45.500
    You're not dead.            

19:45.500 --> 19:47.000
  You're not dead at all.       

19:47.000 --> 19:49.300
        You were never dying.   

19:49.300 --> 19:51.700
                    You just did
            this to trick me.   

19:51.700 --> 19:53.600
                    And you were
                all in on it.   

19:53.700 --> 19:55.400
    We listen to our mother.    

19:55.400 --> 19:57.100
    And we thought              
     it would be funny.         

19:57.100 --> 19:58.600
GINO:                           
Ma! No, Ma!                     

20:03.400 --> 20:05.800
      You, you never even       
         had the dream.         

20:05.800 --> 20:08.000
You just did this               
to trick me                     

20:08.000 --> 20:09.900
into getting to name            
my kid that stupid name.        

20:09.900 --> 20:11.100
                    I had to.   

20:11.200 --> 20:13.500
         You're stubborn as your
             grandmother's mule,

20:13.600 --> 20:16.600
              who, incidentally,
        you were named after.   

20:18.600 --> 20:22.000
              I honor tradition.

20:22.100 --> 20:24.100
Yeah, well, I'm gonna           
give you something to honor     

20:24.200 --> 20:25.600
right in the labonz!            

20:25.700 --> 20:27.000
Ladies, ladies, please, please. 

20:27.000 --> 20:28.100
            Please.             
            Stay out of this,   

20:28.100 --> 20:30.200
              if you know what's
            good for you, Paddy.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.700
                         Listen,
                I may be old,   

20:34.700 --> 20:37.200
        but I can still instruct
             others to hurt you.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.200
                         Benito,
                kick your mother

20:38.300 --> 20:40.500
            in the teeth for me.
Okay, Grandma.                  

20:40.600 --> 20:42.400
    Don't you order...          

20:42.400 --> 20:44.700
  Don't you order my son around.

20:44.700 --> 20:47.800
             Gino, go punch your
         grandma in the kidneys.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.200
    Okay, Ma.                   

20:49.200 --> 20:50.100
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.    

20:50.200 --> 20:51.700
                You, you're big,

20:51.800 --> 20:53.000
  throw Carla out the window.   

20:53.000 --> 20:56.200
         No, I'm not gonna throw
             her out the window.

20:56.300 --> 20:57.800
                      All right.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.000
I'll do it, sick as I am.       

21:00.000 --> 21:03.500
      Please, please, I...      

21:03.500 --> 21:05.800
     Mrs. Lozupone, I don't mean
    to be disrespectful here,   

21:05.800 --> 21:07.400
                  but, you know,
          you're not being fair.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.700
                You're asking   
              your daughter here

21:08.700 --> 21:11.800
              to-to name her son
        after a very bad man.   

21:11.800 --> 21:13.100
And-and you faked death         

21:13.100 --> 21:14.400
            to get her to do it.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.700
            I mean, these are   
                 not your, uh...

21:16.700 --> 21:20.000
          typical mother things.

21:20.100 --> 21:23.800
Are you saying I'm a bad mother?

21:23.900 --> 21:25.600
             Well, yeah, in this
            case, yeah, I am.   

21:25.700 --> 21:27.000
(all gasping)                   

21:27.100 --> 21:28.100
                          CARLA:
                            Sam.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.700
             What?              

21:29.700 --> 21:31.800
You insulted my mother.         

21:31.900 --> 21:33.200
In her own house.               

21:33.300 --> 21:36.900
With the food that we           
cooked over her deathbed        

21:36.900 --> 21:38.900
still stuck                     
in your teeth.                  

21:39.000 --> 21:40.200
                Is that bad?    

21:40.200 --> 21:42.800
         (all hissing)          

21:45.500 --> 21:47.800
      (hissing continues)       

21:51.700 --> 21:52.800
That's great, Carla.            

21:52.800 --> 21:54.400
I'm glad                        
you guys made up.               

21:54.500 --> 21:58.200
         Well, his name         
    is now Benito Mussolini.    

21:58.200 --> 22:00.800
Call him Gino, for short.       

22:00.800 --> 22:04.000
Yeah, she sounds                
so happy.                       

22:04.000 --> 22:05.900
 She said that's the first time 
      they've all sat down      

22:05.900 --> 22:07.200
  to a family dinner in years.  

22:07.200 --> 22:09.200
    They ate, they laughed,     

22:09.300 --> 22:11.000
they even                       
got up and danced.              

22:11.000 --> 22:12.700
Those Italian families          
sound so warm.                  

22:12.800 --> 22:15.300
          Yeah, I know          
     what you mean, Woody.      

22:15.300 --> 22:17.900
Gee, I often wish that I was    
a member of an ethnic group.    

22:18.000 --> 22:20.400
Oh, it's...                     

22:22.400 --> 22:24.800
Oh, it's just as well.          

22:24.800 --> 22:27.000
I hate hugging.                 

22:28.200 --> 22:30.400
Frasier, it's time to go.       

22:30.500 --> 22:33.700
Boy, I-I sure married           
the right woman.                

22:42.500 --> 22:43.800
              Good-bye, Mama.   

22:43.800 --> 22:45.400
            I love you.         
    Mmm.                        

22:45.400 --> 22:46.400
              See you next week.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.600
              Oh, wait a minute,
      I almost forgot something.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.600
Good night, Sammy.              

22:56.600 --> 22:58.800
                      (muffled):
            Carla, please let   
                 me out. Please.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.000
Sammy, would you                
stop whining?                   

23:01.100 --> 23:02.600
    It's a family tradition.    

23:02.700 --> 23:05.000
        You cross Mama,         
     you sleep in the wall.     

23:05.100 --> 23:07.400
    (muffled shouting)
