00:00.834 --> 00:02.871
I want you to meet 2 new friends of mine.

00:02.936 --> 00:04.973
This is Le and this is Hawke.

00:05.038 --> 00:07.882
Hawke, what a powerful name.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.511
Next, on Airwolf.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.055
My Aunt Minh, she's gone.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.852
What do you mean, "gone"? Gone where?

00:15.115 --> 00:17.595
Fellow there said you might
know this gal, help me find her.

00:17.651 --> 00:18.789
I've never seen her.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.331
I've seen that girl.

00:20.387 --> 00:23.630
If she hasn't been home in a week,
I don't think she's coming home.

00:24.791 --> 00:25.963
It's a rip-off!

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

05:09.609 --> 05:10.644
Where is he?

05:56.022 --> 05:57.524
Why all the guns?

05:57.591 --> 05:59.127
Creates a climate trust.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.438
This is what trust is all about.

06:09.135 --> 06:11.115
We should stay in closer touch, my friend.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.851
Like they say, the best…

06:14.007 --> 06:16.510
the best business calls are always personal.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.607
You said 3.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.641
The 3rd one just didn't work out.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.580
Had to drop her off.

07:19.306 --> 07:20.376
Le.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.475
- Hi, Cate.
- Hi.

07:21.541 --> 07:22.576
- Is Uncle String here?
- Hey, Half-Pint.

07:22.642 --> 07:23.916
He's right over there.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.456
Uncle String!

07:28.081 --> 07:29.458
What's the matter, son?

07:29.516 --> 07:31.257
My Aunt Minh, she's gone.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.797
What do you mean, "gone"? Gone where?

07:32.852 --> 07:34.798
Just gone. She never came home.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.197
You mean last night?

07:36.256 --> 07:37.360
Friday.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.732
Friday?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.499
That's a whole week.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.404
I know something bad
must've happened to her.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.034
Uncle String, you've got to find her.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.317
That's it?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.756
The Firm has no reason to
have her under surveillance.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.129
Michael, come on. You know you
guys always hold stuff back.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.727
Marlene, will you excuse me?

08:17.964 --> 08:21.741
This is what taking it all the
way to the top really means.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.387
Sorry, Hawke. That's it.
That's all we've got.

08:33.813 --> 08:36.054
This doesn't make any sense at all.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.962
Le said her clothes, luggage,
makeup, everything was still there.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.193
Sounds like she was planning on coming back.

08:43.655 --> 08:46.000
I know she wouldn't leave him,

08:46.292 --> 08:48.568
unless it was against her will.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.607
Do you think she was kidnapped?

08:50.663 --> 08:52.973
I really don't know what to think.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.070
When was the last time the boy saw her?

08:55.135 --> 08:57.137
Friday morning when he left for school.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.082
Said he came back at 4:00 and she was gone.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.548
Did she have a car?

09:01.608 --> 09:03.519
He said that was gone, too.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.851
Michael, there's gotta be something more.

09:05.912 --> 09:09.416
String, you just filed a missing
persons report just 2 hours ago.

09:09.649 --> 09:12.528
You gotta give the cops
a chance to do their job.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.121
Oh Dom, that's not good enough.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.429
I don't care if he's Sin Jin's kid or not,

09:17.490 --> 09:20.096
I'm the only family he's
got. I gotta do someth’n.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.041
She got any other closets?

09:28.101 --> 09:29.136
No.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.977
She sends a lot of stuff
to the cleaner's, huh?

09:32.639 --> 09:33.947
I don't know.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.611
Let's go check the kitchen.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.746
Uncle String, I want to help,

09:37.977 --> 09:40.924
but I don't know any of these
things that you asked me.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.723
Hey, take it easy.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.730
I didn't know what cleaners
my Mother used either.

09:49.155 --> 09:50.725
It's not like you're in charge of her.

09:50.790 --> 09:54.761
Last Friday, I didn't come home
at 4:00 like I told you I did.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.969
I didn't come home till 6:30.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.907
Well, she's not gone 'cause of you.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.140
I thought she'd come back.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.681
Listen, Le.

10:06.739 --> 10:09.686
Wherever she is, she misses you
just as much as you miss her.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.619
Really?

10:13.079 --> 10:15.491
You wait and see what
she says when I find her.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.255
Come on, let's check the kitchen.

10:20.019 --> 10:23.000
Did your Mother ever write you any
notes, like, "Cut the grass," or…

10:23.056 --> 10:25.058
"Do your homework before you watch TV?"

10:27.560 --> 10:30.871
Sometimes she'd write a note and
stick it on the door of the fridge.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.600
This is Hawke. Can I
speak to Michael, please?

11:01.427 --> 11:02.838
Yes Hawke, what is it?

11:02.896 --> 11:05.775
Michael, could you do me a favor and
check out some phone numbers for me?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.505
Okay, what are you looking for?

11:08.401 --> 11:11.075
Kinda look’n for one special
one that just doesn't fit.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.838
Ya’ll have to come back tomorrow.

11:43.903 --> 11:46.577
We don't accept deliveries after 6:00.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.641
I'm no delivery boy, I…

11:48.708 --> 11:49.880
I'm looking for a friend.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.648
Aren't we all.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.483
This the number of this club?

11:55.548 --> 11:56.891
That's one of our numbers.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.452
Why is it unlisted?

11:58.518 --> 12:00.327
You with the Police?

12:00.954 --> 12:02.627
We have a very exclusive following.

12:02.689 --> 12:06.102
The Management doesn't
want just anyone dropping in.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.732
So we change the phone numbers
often, and we never list them.

12:09.796 --> 12:12.276
There's nothing illegal about that.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.907
I never said there was.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.743
You're not with the Police?

12:16.803 --> 12:19.010
I'm looking for a friend.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.839
Pardon me.

12:45.732 --> 12:48.975
Fellow there said you might know
this gal, help me find her.

12:49.035 --> 12:52.039
Nobody invited you to this party.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.709
Do you know her or not?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.650
I've never seen her.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.121
You know, it's kinda dark in here,
you might take a closer look.

13:00.179 --> 13:02.921
If I'd seen her, I would remember.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.890
Listen, I'm not a cop,
I'm looking for a friend.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.227
A friend?

13:08.488 --> 13:11.765
Yeah, a friend. She's
take’n care of this little boy.

13:11.824 --> 13:14.168
She's been gone for more
than a week and he's real upset.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.400
Sad story.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.935
I've still never seen her.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.946
How about any of the rest of you?

13:28.474 --> 13:30.147
I don't know her.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.628
I really wish I could help you.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.493
Please.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.058
I've seen that girl.

14:52.125 --> 14:55.470
I saw your friend with Nick
Kincaid at Nick's Paradise.

14:56.262 --> 14:57.332
What's Nick's Paradise?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.172
It's a club, it’s not sleazy like this.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.371
It's in Beverly Hills. Everybody goes there.

15:02.101 --> 15:04.274
What, is that her… was
she Kincaid's date or…

15:04.337 --> 15:06.408
No, they had a fight.

15:06.806 --> 15:10.015
She was talking to another Oriental
girl. I think they were sisters.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.152
- Sister.
- That's what they said.

15:12.211 --> 15:15.454
The girl had just come in
from Hong Kong or somewhere.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.985
But Kincaid didn't like your
friend being there at all.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.293
You said she had a kid?

15:22.355 --> 15:24.596
Well, it's her nephew, he's…

15:24.991 --> 15:26.766
he's the same as her son.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.368
I had a kid once.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.267
A little girl.

15:33.299 --> 15:34.471
Look,

15:34.634 --> 15:37.240
Kincaid doesn't take any
trouble from any of his girls,

15:37.303 --> 15:39.715
and your friend gave him a lot of trouble.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.912
If she hasn't been home in a week,
I don't think she's come’n home.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.060
There it is.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.286
Nicholas Kincaid, age 38,

15:52.351 --> 15:54.058
motion picture producer.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.133
He does own Nick's Paradise.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.666
Says here he lives at
a very expensive address.

15:58.724 --> 15:59.828
Expensive cars.

15:59.892 --> 16:03.533
And he owns a Vietnam
War-style Huey helicopter.

16:05.031 --> 16:08.501
And those things go at about a
million and a half, even at surplus.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.047
What else?

16:10.102 --> 16:12.013
There's a woman living at the same address.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.642
Isela Arragon, Brazilian passport.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.914
We have anything on her, Marlene?

16:16.976 --> 16:20.150
INS has her as a Resident
Alien, Fashion Designer.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.655
Has this computer got anything
more on this guy Kincaid?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.432
I'm sorry sir, I'm not sure
why he's even in this computer.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.298
He doesn't seem to fit any of the profiles.

16:34.293 --> 16:35.533
There.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.098
That's why we're keeping tabs on him.

16:38.231 --> 16:41.440
Did Minh ever say anything
about her sister being an actress?

16:41.534 --> 16:42.945
Never.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.511
This whole thing stinks.

16:47.273 --> 16:50.743
I've got an idea that guy Kincaid's
gonna end up with a rotten fish.

16:51.777 --> 16:54.656
Hawke, I'm beginning to
see that look in your eye.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.352
Well, can you blame him?

16:56.415 --> 16:58.190
Besides being Half-Pint's Mother,

16:58.251 --> 17:01.289
we could be talk’n
about Sin Jin's wife here.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.691
And who the hell knows
what happened to Minh.

17:04.323 --> 17:06.963
Minh's not coming back, is she?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.404
Le, I don't know.

17:11.797 --> 17:15.472
I do know that whatever's
happened to her, it's not good.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.244
Why'd she go away?

17:20.573 --> 17:23.416
If he knew that, he'd
be close to finding her.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.719
We just have to be patient. It
might take a little bit of time.

17:27.313 --> 17:31.159
I think that Minh went look’n for some
woman that she thought was her sister.

17:32.451 --> 17:33.930
My Mother?

17:33.986 --> 17:35.363
Maybe.

17:37.123 --> 17:38.727
Minh said she was dead.

17:43.996 --> 17:48.172
You'd know better than me how
things were over there after the war.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.640
Whoever told her that
might just have been wrong.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.444
I wanna help you look for them.

17:54.941 --> 17:58.013
If I was you, I suppose I'd say
the same thing. Dangerous.

17:58.477 --> 18:01.617
I knew plenty of people
like that back in Saigon.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.651
I'm not afraid of them.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.355
Le, nobody thinks you're afraid.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.563
Uncle String, I wanna help.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.498
I know I can do something.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.404
There's just no stop’n you, is there kid?

18:20.900 --> 18:23.608
Well, I suppose you'd be better
off where I can keep my eye on you.

18:32.144 --> 18:35.489
Then I was talk’n to some of
the boys down at the airport

18:35.881 --> 18:37.724
and they said that his bird,

18:37.783 --> 18:40.764
and the engines, have been heavily modified.

18:40.987 --> 18:44.025
They said it'll make 300 knots.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.499
It's got state-of-the-art avionics.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.736
Now, it doesn't have a weapons system,

18:49.795 --> 18:52.401
but it could be turned into
a gunship just like that.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.940
I'd say that right now,

18:56.002 --> 18:59.074
it's the hottest bird
in private hands today.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.683
Except for the Lady, of course.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.576
You're not gonna believe this.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.452
Did you audition for the part?

19:05.511 --> 19:06.717
Listen to this.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.986
“She removes her clothes
one piece at a time,”

19:09.048 --> 19:12.291
“as she crosses slowly from the
door to the waiting bubble bath.”

19:14.654 --> 19:16.156
That's the part they wanted to audition.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.793
The girl doesn't even have any dialog.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.100
I'll tell you what kind
of films they're make’n.

19:22.595 --> 19:26.407
Seems to be some question whether
he actually makes these films.

19:26.465 --> 19:29.674
He seems to have plenty of money, but
nobody's sure where it comes from.

19:31.237 --> 19:33.012
It's all drug money.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.319
Well, he fits the profile.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.144
He seems to do quite a lot
of business in the Orient,

19:38.244 --> 19:41.589
and through this woman Isela Arragon,
has connections in South America.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.720
You know, I could probably get
to him through this chopper.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.465
Well, however you decide to approach him,

19:50.523 --> 19:53.003
you're gonna have one major problem.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.035
You don't fit into his world.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.469
Meaning?

19:56.529 --> 20:00.306
I don't think flight jackets and jeans
are gonna cut it in Kincaid's crowd.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.013
What would you suggest, El Blanco?

20:07.707 --> 20:10.244
I think we should fight flash with flash.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.856
Department S is standing by.

20:15.114 --> 20:16.218
"S" for…

20:16.282 --> 20:17.920
"S" for Style.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.897
All right Michael, 2 things.

20:23.322 --> 20:25.802
No, not any white.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.403
And outfit the kid.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.366
He's gotta go with me.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.515
Keep your eyes open now.

21:18.577 --> 21:20.648
Don't worry, got your back door.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.331
Could be an actor.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.971
Don't you ever get enough?

21:43.903 --> 21:45.473
Never heard of Nick Kincaid.

21:45.704 --> 21:47.945
But he told me he owned the joint.

21:48.707 --> 21:50.118
What can I tell you?

21:53.445 --> 21:55.254
- Here he comes.
- I see him.

21:55.347 --> 21:57.349
You see, I was in Nam, Air Cav.

21:57.416 --> 22:00.693
This buddy of mine told me I
oughta drop by and look him up.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.934
Said he was always around the
place. Just like to buy him a drink.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.370
What was your buddy's name?

22:07.426 --> 22:08.871
Bartlett.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.772
I spent a couple of years with
him in the Central Highlands.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.567
You Kincaid?

22:14.667 --> 22:15.975
I've never heard of Bartlett.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.776
Might not be right.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.175
I'm not very good with names.

22:20.239 --> 22:21.912
How about your name?

22:25.244 --> 22:26.552
Hawke.

22:27.413 --> 22:29.324
Stringfellow Hawke.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.223
My partner's name is Le.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.690
You don't talk much, do you?

22:37.990 --> 22:41.028
He's more into watching. Buy you a drink?

22:42.428 --> 22:45.272
Take him over to my table,
meet some of my friends, okay?

22:52.438 --> 22:53.644
The kid holds the money?

22:57.676 --> 22:59.849
That's more than I'd expected.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.922
World is full of surprises.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.459
What do you want from Kincaid?

23:06.518 --> 23:07.997
I'm a pilot.

23:08.787 --> 23:12.132
I'll fly anything, any
place, anywhere, any time.

23:12.791 --> 23:13.895
If the money's right.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.235
Oh, and you think Kincaid needs a pilot?

23:17.763 --> 23:19.299
So I've heard.

23:19.531 --> 23:21.568
If I could find him, I'd ask him myself.

23:22.968 --> 23:24.606
All right, let's have a drink.

23:39.151 --> 23:42.428
Isela, my darling, I want you
to meet 2 new friends of mine.

23:42.488 --> 23:43.967
This is Le.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.596
This is Hawke.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.099
Hawke.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.545
What a powerful name.

24:05.411 --> 24:07.721
Limousine for Mr. Kincaid, please.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.317
Oh, that was a good time, Hawke.
Let's do it again some day.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.622
Don't tell me, Lamborghini, right?

24:15.721 --> 24:17.257
The white Rolls?

24:17.389 --> 24:20.427
The black helicopter, over here.
I'll take it myself, thanks.

24:22.695 --> 24:23.935
Sure.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.938
See what you mean.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.807
Hawke, give me a call
in the morning, will you?

24:27.866 --> 24:30.142
I might need a pilot after all.

24:33.772 --> 24:35.251
I wasn't scared, were you?

24:35.307 --> 24:37.014
I was scared the whole time.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.917
How'd you keep a straight face?

24:39.979 --> 24:42.255
Come on, get across, let's go.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.429
- You think I'm making a mistake?
- What?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.837
I said,
“Do you think I'm making a mistake?”

24:56.895 --> 24:59.375
I'll let you know after you talk
to your friend Billy Bartlett.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.256
Nick, your call from Bartlett.

25:21.820 --> 25:22.924
Billy.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.867
This Billy Bartlett?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.868
Well, it's Nick Kincaid.

25:29.428 --> 25:31.032
Good to hear from you.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.871
It's been a long time. How you do’n?

25:32.931 --> 25:33.966
Fine.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.341
You still flying?

25:35.401 --> 25:37.244
Got my own charter service.

25:37.302 --> 25:39.748
Oh, yeah? How many choppers do you have?

25:41.240 --> 25:43.379
Whoa, I'm impressed.

25:44.043 --> 25:47.047
Billy, what do you know about a
guy called Stringfellow Hawke?

25:47.112 --> 25:49.558
He's a good guy, I met him in Nam.

25:49.615 --> 25:51.561
Well, he came into the club the other night.

25:51.617 --> 25:53.324
Oh good, I told him to look you up.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.489
Well, he did.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.657
What do you have to say about him?

25:55.721 --> 25:57.667
He's a stand-up guy, hell of a pilot.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.294
He knows what to remember, what to forget.

26:02.528 --> 26:04.201
It's the kind of guy
who'd be flying for you.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.333
Any time.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.741
All right Billy, nice talking to you.

26:08.467 --> 26:09.673
Right.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.479
I think it worked.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.379
Well, Bartlett vouches for

26:18.310 --> 26:20.085
Stringfellow Hawke.

26:35.661 --> 26:37.140
What do you think?

26:37.196 --> 26:38.834
I don't know how you do it.

26:38.897 --> 26:40.968
I don't mean them, I mean the bird.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.575
She is a real beauty.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.081
Good thing.

26:46.138 --> 26:49.483
Anybody can have a hot car. Having something
like this, I think, makes you special.

26:49.641 --> 26:51.484
So, what's my part?

26:51.777 --> 26:53.814
Just keep her running.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.753
Quite a deal you've got yourself here.

26:57.015 --> 26:58.119
Girls to go, huh?

26:58.183 --> 26:59.594
We deliver.

27:00.486 --> 27:03.296
Any place, anytime, anything you can afford.

27:04.857 --> 27:07.235
See, I figure it's just
a matter of imagination.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.133
Paradise is my business, you see?

27:10.596 --> 27:13.440
I buy it, I sell it, I rent it.

27:14.099 --> 27:15.703
Sometimes I even create it.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.660
Who are these guys?

27:37.723 --> 27:39.464
Who do you think they are?

28:13.358 --> 28:14.564
How's it go’n?

28:14.626 --> 28:16.799
I was afraid you weren't
going to be able to find us.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.672
No problem. You gave perfect directions.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.195
Who were those guys anyway?

28:40.252 --> 28:42.562
Well you know, rip-offs are
just an occupational hazard

28:42.621 --> 28:43.964
in this profession.

28:47.059 --> 28:50.905
Don't worry about a thing, I'll just make
a few calls, and they'll be taken care of.

28:51.029 --> 28:52.667
Everybody back there all right?

28:54.733 --> 28:56.508
That was great flying, old boy.

29:04.643 --> 29:07.954
Dope deals, rip-offs, automatic weapons?

29:08.213 --> 29:10.318
Now this is getting too dangerous.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.893
I think we'd better just play our
hand out like it is, huh kid?

29:14.419 --> 29:16.660
But I don't like that woman.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.927
Isela Arragon.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.937
Do you think she could be a problem?

29:22.294 --> 29:23.796
Is there anything we can do?

29:23.862 --> 29:25.535
There's one thing you could do.

29:26.965 --> 29:29.002
A complete systems check on Lady.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.212
On the Lady? What for?

29:31.637 --> 29:34.208
Well, with this fascination
this guy has with women,

29:35.907 --> 29:39.354
I got a hunch that our Lady is
something he just couldn't resist.

29:53.592 --> 29:55.333
Who are you, Hawke?

29:56.862 --> 29:59.638
I'm just a guy trying to get by.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.203
You know, when I was a little girl,

30:04.403 --> 30:07.714
I used to watch the hawks diving
through the canyons near our village.

30:07.873 --> 30:10.080
They were so beautiful, and so graceful,

30:10.142 --> 30:14.056
the way they would just
seem to glide for hours.

30:15.781 --> 30:18.318
Suddenly they would dive
straight down at the ground.

30:18.383 --> 30:23.423
And when they would reappear, a furry
little animal would be in their claws.

30:25.724 --> 30:28.227
Yeah, that's part of
the food chain, you know.

30:28.293 --> 30:30.330
Everybody's gotta eat.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.472
Who is going to end up
in your claws, Mr. Hawke?

31:08.166 --> 31:09.804
Why don't you and I take a walk?

31:11.370 --> 31:14.010
Wouldn't wanna lose my options here.

31:16.007 --> 31:19.648
You like that, huh? They'll be here,
they'll be waiting, if you want them to.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.784
Could be worth 7 figures to you.

31:24.649 --> 31:26.322
That's serious.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.160
Wait for me here.

31:39.998 --> 31:42.842
Hi there. What can we do for you?

31:47.873 --> 31:49.614
What questions?

32:08.660 --> 32:11.573
Every Christmas, a big Huey,
with beautiful girls,

32:11.630 --> 32:14.133
would land in wherever the hell we were at.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.735
Bob Hope would come out and do his jokes,

32:15.801 --> 32:19.271
and then the beautiful girls would
come on stage and strut their stuff.

32:19.571 --> 32:22.245
Then, about an hour later, they
were all gone. You know how it was.

32:23.508 --> 32:25.488
They were like birds from paradise.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.182
That's where I got the idea.

32:29.381 --> 32:32.294
Awful high-dollar bird just to have parties.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.029
Well now, that's how it started.

32:34.085 --> 32:37.157
Now the girls are just used
as bonuses to be thrown around.

33:00.045 --> 33:02.582
Who says it never snows in Hollywood land?

33:03.448 --> 33:05.689
Well, I never mix business with business.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.201
So, you're gonna take
the Huey across the border.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.530
It's the smuggler's lady.

33:16.628 --> 33:17.834
Tell me more.

33:17.896 --> 33:20.376
What you did today impressed me.

33:20.866 --> 33:23.437
And I have the biggest
score yet coming up, so…

33:24.636 --> 33:26.616
I thought you might wanna co-pilot for me.

33:28.306 --> 33:31.310
7 figures just to ride in the left seat.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.256
It's a new connection.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.691
I think it's time I took you to
meet the real smuggler's lady.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.380
And if they're still on your tail…

35:00.198 --> 35:02.940
This is the smuggler's lady, my friend.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.778
I'm impressed.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.336
Buy's set for tomorrow at dawn.

35:33.398 --> 35:37.312
String, you can't involve Airwolf
in a drug deal. Now, you can't.

35:38.269 --> 35:41.341
Dom, the Lady is my only surefire bait.

35:41.606 --> 35:44.109
Well, you can't go
alone, I mean that's just…

35:44.175 --> 35:46.121
Right, it's just too dangerous.

35:46.177 --> 35:48.179
Well, I'm going with you, aren't I?

35:49.114 --> 35:50.525
No, son.

35:53.551 --> 35:55.360
I've gotta play this one out on my own.

36:09.934 --> 36:11.106
Yes?

36:12.370 --> 36:14.475
It's a good thing I
continued to check on Hawke.

36:14.539 --> 36:17.315
Vargas has been telling me
something very interesting.

36:17.375 --> 36:21.255
This guy Hawke, he's been asking a
lot of questions about some girl.

36:21.312 --> 36:22.791
And you know the girl he means.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.224
I didn't tell him anything.

36:24.282 --> 36:26.353
But that girl you gave me, that Lynn,

36:26.451 --> 36:28.260
she told him the girl had been with you.

36:28.319 --> 36:29.696
That's how he got to us.

36:31.956 --> 36:33.902
I think he's a Fed.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.966
That would explain why
Bartlett vouched for him.

36:37.128 --> 36:39.506
The DEA, or somebody, got to Bartlett.

36:41.299 --> 36:43.142
Well, you see, that doesn't change anything.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.807
Well, it does to me. I want some insurance.

36:47.305 --> 36:49.148
I want to be there all right.

36:50.508 --> 36:53.387
Well now, you suit yourselves,
but I'm gonna tell you then,

36:54.813 --> 36:58.351
by sun-up, Hawke is gonna be dead.

37:02.220 --> 37:06.191
And then we have that
beautiful bird all to ourselves.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.158
Where's Kincaid?

38:07.218 --> 38:08.322
He said he'd be here.

38:08.386 --> 38:10.024
He told me he'd be with you.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.629
Maybe he's stuck in traffic.

38:12.857 --> 38:14.427
Maybe he's not coming.

39:02.540 --> 39:03.951
Pretty impressive.

39:04.576 --> 39:07.750
I would've given you a demonstration, I
just didn't wanna wake the neighbors.

39:08.646 --> 39:10.057
How thoughtful.

39:10.815 --> 39:12.317
Now, what's this all about?

39:12.383 --> 39:15.728
Well, remember when I told you
about the fact that rip-offs were

39:16.154 --> 39:18.430
an occupational hazard in this profession?

39:19.824 --> 39:21.929
You got the money, he's got the dope.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.802
But you got that beautiful bird.

39:27.232 --> 39:29.269
And you'll have a hell of a time taking her.

39:29.334 --> 39:31.109
Won't be as tough as you think.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.959
You okay, Half-Pint?

39:47.185 --> 39:49.859
Your partner here didn't make
it to school this morning.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.594
You let him go.

39:51.656 --> 39:53.658
I'll do whatever you want.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.631
You're gonna do that anyway.

39:55.693 --> 39:57.263
What did you do to Minh?

39:57.328 --> 39:58.363
You wanna know?

39:58.429 --> 40:00.909
Hey Kincaid, he's just a kid.

40:03.301 --> 40:05.303
See, she came to the club one day,

40:06.004 --> 40:08.314
she looked for her sister.
Her sister wasn't there.

40:08.373 --> 40:09.852
But that didn't stop her.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.888
She told all the other girls in the club

40:11.943 --> 40:14.856
they didn't have to do what
I said. I couldn't have that.

40:15.213 --> 40:17.591
So, I just took her in this
beautiful bird right here.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.993
We flew about 50 miles out to sea

40:20.051 --> 40:22.053
and then, I just sort of dropped her…

40:31.262 --> 40:32.468
Get in there.

40:48.012 --> 40:49.355
Michael, you got him.

40:53.251 --> 40:54.355
Let me go, Hawke!

40:54.419 --> 40:55.591
Not a chance, you're stay’n with me.

40:55.653 --> 40:56.757
And I'm going with you.

40:56.821 --> 40:59.461
Well, I'm sure glad you guys
always do what I ask you to do.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.204
Can we lose him?

41:10.668 --> 41:12.545
I'm not gonna try to lose him.

41:12.603 --> 41:14.310
I think I'm gonna fight him.

41:14.372 --> 41:15.851
Are you crazy?

41:15.940 --> 41:17.544
I think we can take him.

41:33.257 --> 41:34.861
Where is he, Dom?

41:34.926 --> 41:36.735
I have him on radar.

41:38.763 --> 41:40.401
I just got him now.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.491
Give me combat mode.

42:03.554 --> 42:04.862
Combat mode.

42:22.573 --> 42:24.348
You haven't got a chance, Kincaid.

42:24.409 --> 42:26.013
Turn that bird around.

42:26.077 --> 42:27.249
Listen to him.

42:27.311 --> 42:29.484
You know what's gonna
happen if we give it up?

42:29.547 --> 42:31.788
Well, it is better than being dead.

42:31.849 --> 42:33.726
That's the same thing.

42:33.818 --> 42:36.731
Kincaid, give it up. You
saw what this ship can do.

43:45.990 --> 43:48.300
The Police just confirmed Minh's death.

43:52.330 --> 43:54.867
Kincaid made an example of her.

43:55.533 --> 43:57.774
I'm sorry, Hawke.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.248
It'd be a lot harder not know’n.

44:01.506 --> 44:03.076
Let it go, kid.

44:03.708 --> 44:05.187
She's gone.

44:05.309 --> 44:06.879
No, no Dom, I wasn't think’n of me.

44:06.944 --> 44:09.447
I know. But he's a tough little guy.

44:09.714 --> 44:11.318
He'll be okay.

44:14.519 --> 44:16.999
I just know what he's been think’n.

44:17.188 --> 44:19.634
You know Hawke, in spite of
everything that's happened,

44:19.690 --> 44:22.603
there's no real proof
that he's Sin Jin's son.

44:24.028 --> 44:26.338
It just doesn't make
any difference, Michael.

44:26.797 --> 44:28.743
That damn war.

44:29.467 --> 44:33.313
Never knew who the enemy was,
never knew who your friends were.

44:33.371 --> 44:35.510
Now we don't know who our children are.

44:39.477 --> 44:41.354
I was so scared for you.

44:43.714 --> 44:45.489
They were no match for the Lady.

44:45.917 --> 44:47.794
Then I could've gone with you?

44:49.220 --> 44:50.494
Next time.

44:51.989 --> 44:53.832
Come on Marlene, there must be something

44:53.891 --> 44:56.599
out here that desperately
needs our attention.

45:04.302 --> 45:05.804
You know, Half-Pint,

45:08.673 --> 45:11.119
maybe you'd think about
coming live’n with me.

45:12.476 --> 45:16.117
Make you part of the family,
like Caitlin and Dom here.

45:18.849 --> 45:21.853
But what if your brother comes back?

45:22.119 --> 45:24.190
And as it turns out, he's not my Dad.

45:29.627 --> 45:30.901
I'll be your Dad.

45:31.305 --> 45:37.814
