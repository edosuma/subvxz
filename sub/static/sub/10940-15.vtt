WEBVTT

00:00.097 --> 00:01.655
<i>Previously on "Heartland"...</i>

00:01.765 --> 00:04.290
- Mom, you remember Caleb.
- Oh, of course.

00:04.401 --> 00:05.891
He's the only guy
that really gets me.

00:06.003 --> 00:07.971
Getting what he wants
is probably closer to the truth.

00:08.071 --> 00:11.735
Tim's been milking this bullet wound
like a dairy farmer with 10 hands.

00:11.842 --> 00:14.743
Do we have cheddar cheese?
Just if we do.

00:14.845 --> 00:16.437
Can't tell anyone
you're staying here, okay?

00:16.547 --> 00:18.640
Are you worried
you're gonna sully my reputation?

00:18.749 --> 00:20.148
I'm worried you're gonna sully mine.

00:20.250 --> 00:23.083
There's obviously nothing between us,
so there's nothing to explain.

00:23.187 --> 00:24.415
I have to have some tests done.

00:24.521 --> 00:26.614
My doctor is probably
just being overly cautious.

00:27.124 --> 00:28.284
You, Ty Borden.

00:28.392 --> 00:30.860
No matter what I do,
I always end up with more questions.

00:30.961 --> 00:33.088
You know those things you said
last night about your stepdad?

00:33.197 --> 00:34.425
Why didn't you ever tell me?

00:34.531 --> 00:37.329
I never told anyone
that stuff before.

00:43.407 --> 00:45.102
Jack!

00:48.178 --> 00:49.805
Hey!

00:51.381 --> 00:53.872
Sure didn't take you long
to take me up on my offer.

00:54.885 --> 00:56.978
Man gives you a gift of free hay,
you jump on it.

00:57.087 --> 00:58.987
Free?
Who said anything about free?

01:00.224 --> 01:02.556
You did. Your message.

01:02.659 --> 01:04.650
And I quote,
"Jack, you want some hay?"

01:04.760 --> 01:09.494
Yeah. I got 200 tons of hay
and two longhorns to eat it.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.589
You know what?

01:10.701 --> 01:13.693
I don't want to ruin our relationship
over 100-buck hay.

01:13.804 --> 01:15.931
75, or I'm dumping it back.

01:16.106 --> 01:20.338
75? That is a gift.

01:20.978 --> 01:22.878
What the heck?

01:29.019 --> 01:31.180
Oh, this is wonderful, dear.

01:31.288 --> 01:34.086
Sugarfoot loves your muffins.

01:34.191 --> 01:36.989
And your timing is perfect

01:37.127 --> 01:39.652
because I couldn't find
my reading glasses.

01:41.398 --> 01:42.695
Special delivery.

01:42.799 --> 01:44.562
Did I win the sweepstakes?

01:44.668 --> 01:47.136
Not exactly.

01:49.373 --> 01:52.206
It's about Sugarfoot.
From Hudson County.

01:52.342 --> 01:53.741
Hudson Derby?

01:53.844 --> 01:57.439
No, not the derby, Mrs. Bell.
They haven't run that in years.

01:57.548 --> 01:59.106
Not since the last time.

01:59.216 --> 02:02.777
Your father and your grandfather
almost killed each other.

02:02.886 --> 02:04.478
Now, what's this about Sugarfoot?

02:06.156 --> 02:07.783
I'll tell you what.

02:07.891 --> 02:11.383
Why don't I make a few calls,
take care of this for you?

02:12.863 --> 02:15.127
So, apparently you need
at least one hectare

02:15.232 --> 02:17.257
in order to keep livestock
on your property,

02:17.367 --> 02:19.267
according to this bylaw.

02:19.369 --> 02:20.495
Bylaws.

02:20.604 --> 02:21.662
And the upshot is

02:21.772 --> 02:24.900
they are threatening
to impound Sugarfoot.

02:25.008 --> 02:27.033
- Unless what?
- There is no unless.

02:27.177 --> 02:29.645
And as far as Mrs. Bell
was concerned,

02:29.746 --> 02:32.374
we're having a nice conversation
about the Hudson Derby.

02:32.482 --> 02:35.815
The Hudson Derby?
Now, that takes me back.

02:35.919 --> 02:39.013
Well, I finally found
my damn checkbook.

02:39.122 --> 02:42.455
I figure the prospect
of buying hay from you

02:42.559 --> 02:44.993
must have clouded my memory.

02:45.095 --> 02:46.323
Hey, speaking of memories, Jack,

02:46.430 --> 02:48.898
I bet you remember
the Hudson Derby.

02:48.999 --> 02:51.263
What's that got to do with anything?

02:52.269 --> 02:55.067
Last time I ever heard
anyone saying, "I'm number two!

02:55.172 --> 02:57.163
I'm number two!"

03:03.180 --> 03:04.943
Nice one, Dad.

03:07.684 --> 03:09.675
Hey, check it out.

03:10.721 --> 03:12.518
He's a real looker, hey.

03:12.623 --> 03:14.352
Yeah. Where'd you get him from?

03:14.524 --> 03:16.014
From me. His name's Money.

03:16.126 --> 03:19.618
Oh, you gave Ty a horse?
That's a pretty special present.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.459
Not really, actually.

03:21.565 --> 03:23.123
Ty said you guys
could re-home him.

03:24.167 --> 03:25.464
He did, did he?

03:25.569 --> 03:28.436
I know. I know, I know.
But I'm kind of desperate.

03:28.538 --> 03:31.098
My uncle just dumped him on me.

03:31.208 --> 03:33.540
I put an ad on the Net
about a month ago with a picture.

03:33.644 --> 03:35.043
And you know what?
So far, <i>nada.</i>

03:35.145 --> 03:38.114
Yeah. Maybe a picture
was a bad idea.

03:38.215 --> 03:40.706
Isn't he the fugliest horse
you've ever seen?

03:40.817 --> 03:42.546
But he's got a great personality.

03:42.653 --> 03:45.315
I just thought that we're all set up
for re-homing, so...

03:45.422 --> 03:48.721
Yeah. No, it's awesome.
It can be like your special project.

03:51.361 --> 03:52.350
Yeah.

03:55.799 --> 03:57.289
You know, I think you're losing it.

03:57.401 --> 03:59.733
Honestly. Your memory's shot.

03:59.836 --> 04:01.599
I won that race fair and square.

04:01.705 --> 04:05.300
No. You took a shortcut.
You should have been disqualified.

04:05.409 --> 04:07.809
Wrong side of a couple of trees.
You call that a shortcut?

04:07.911 --> 04:10.038
You went off course.
I know it. You know it.

04:10.147 --> 04:12.172
The only person that missed it
was the damn spotter.

04:12.282 --> 04:13.613
He was standing right there.

04:13.717 --> 04:15.708
If there was something to spot,
he would have spotted it.

04:15.819 --> 04:16.945
Except he was so drunk

04:17.053 --> 04:18.817
he couldn't see a foot
in front of his face

04:18.922 --> 04:20.219
'cause you bought him the whiskey.

04:20.324 --> 04:21.255
You can have the hay.

04:21.358 --> 04:23.349
- I don't want your damn hay.
- I don't want your damn money.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.587
I don't want to hear any more
about you winning that damn race!

04:25.729 --> 04:27.594
Don't worry.
I'll never mention it again.

04:27.698 --> 04:28.562
Fine!

04:32.536 --> 04:35.004
Even though you know
I won that race by three lengths.

04:35.639 --> 04:37.539
Because you cheated!

<font color="#FF8C00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

05:22.519 --> 05:26.148
See, this bylaw, it refers
to the keeping of livestock.

05:26.256 --> 05:29.020
Sugarfoot is definitely not livestock.

05:29.126 --> 05:30.150
Some people think

05:30.260 --> 05:31.488
of their horses as pets.

05:31.595 --> 05:33.358
But as far as Hudson County
is concerned,

05:33.463 --> 05:34.589
they're in the same category

05:34.698 --> 05:35.858
as cows, chickens, and goats.

05:35.966 --> 05:37.490
Okay. Sugarfoot
is more like

05:37.601 --> 05:38.898
a companion, really.

05:39.002 --> 05:40.469
I mean,
he's a lifesaver.

05:40.570 --> 05:42.003
When Mrs. Bell
had a heart attack,

05:42.105 --> 05:43.436
he did everything
but call 911.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.804
So, this horse is a guide animal?

05:45.909 --> 05:49.743
Yes. Exactly. Like a therapy horse.

05:49.913 --> 05:51.778
Mrs. Bell is visually impaired?

05:51.915 --> 05:54.907
Well, yes. There is impairment.

05:55.018 --> 05:56.315
Definitely.

05:56.420 --> 05:59.184
Of course. We make provisions
for these situations.

05:59.289 --> 06:00.153
Great.

06:00.257 --> 06:01.656
So, then you can just tear up

06:01.758 --> 06:03.487
that letter and make an exception.

06:04.694 --> 06:06.423
Oh, Hudson County doesn't

06:06.530 --> 06:08.657
tear up letters or make exceptions

06:08.765 --> 06:10.858
based on hearsay evidence.

06:10.967 --> 06:14.630
If Mrs. Bell qualifies for the use
of an assistance animal,

06:14.738 --> 06:16.933
that will be taken
into consideration.

06:17.338 --> 06:20.933
Until then,
the bylaw takes precedence.

06:34.157 --> 06:35.715
What the heck are you doing?

06:35.826 --> 06:37.555
Still got that rope of yours?

06:38.161 --> 06:39.219
Yes.

06:39.329 --> 06:41.058
And a horse you can rope off of?

06:41.164 --> 06:42.324
You know I do.

06:42.432 --> 06:44.457
Well, better start practicing.

06:44.568 --> 06:47.036
Foothills rodeo is this weekend,
and I don't want you to suck.

06:47.137 --> 06:48.764
I need the points.

06:48.872 --> 06:50.499
Am I missing something here?

06:50.674 --> 06:52.471
Well, if I do good in broncs
and tie-down roping,

06:52.576 --> 06:54.737
got enough points
to get my pro rodeo card.

06:54.845 --> 06:57.837
But I could do with a third event,
just as insurance.

06:58.315 --> 07:01.580
What, like team roping?

07:04.354 --> 07:05.912
- Okay.
- Yes! Yes!

07:06.823 --> 07:11.089
I knew you couldn't resist.
This baby is a definite chick magnet.

07:11.194 --> 07:13.355
That's what it is.

07:13.897 --> 07:16.297
So, anyway, I'm sure
once she meets Sugarfoot,

07:16.399 --> 07:18.299
her bureaucratic heart will melt

07:18.401 --> 07:20.733
and you know,
everything will be fine.

07:20.837 --> 07:22.771
I hope you know what you're doing.

07:22.906 --> 07:24.066
Hey, Lou!

07:24.174 --> 07:26.642
I've got three loads,
but don't worry.

07:26.743 --> 07:29.906
This time
I brought my own detergent.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.947
Is that sour-cream coffee cake?

07:35.185 --> 07:37.085
Help yourself, Ashley.

07:37.187 --> 07:39.451
In between loads,
do you think I could take Apollo out?

07:39.556 --> 07:41.683
Come on, Ashley.
You know you don't have to ask.

07:41.791 --> 07:44.225
I told you I'd sell him back to you
for next to nothing.

07:44.327 --> 07:45.385
I live in a trailer.

07:45.495 --> 07:47.395
A laundromat
is way outside my budget.

07:47.497 --> 07:49.727
So, how do you think I can afford
to take care of a horse?

07:49.833 --> 07:52.802
I mean, do you have any idea
how much a bale of hay costs?

07:52.903 --> 07:56.304
As a matter of fact, I do.

07:58.341 --> 07:59.740
You can brush him all you want.

07:59.843 --> 08:02.539
He's not gonna get
any better looking.

08:02.646 --> 08:05.080
So your uncle give you any history
on this guy?

08:05.181 --> 08:07.376
Just that Money used to be
a chuck-wagon horse.

08:07.484 --> 08:09.349
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

08:09.452 --> 08:11.352
Well, I think I'm gonna
get Scott to vet him.

08:11.454 --> 08:13.445
See how old he is.
Make sure he's in good shape.

08:13.557 --> 08:15.650
I knew you were the right man
for the job.

08:17.127 --> 08:19.857
You know, I'm really glad
that you're coming this weekend.

08:19.963 --> 08:22.227
For sure it will cut
a couple of seconds off my time

08:22.332 --> 08:24.664
having you there cheering for me.

08:28.405 --> 08:30.396
And we don't have to go
with Caleb and Amy.

08:30.507 --> 08:32.065
We could take your truck.

08:32.174 --> 08:33.607
Amy's coming?

08:34.611 --> 08:37.443
Yeah. She's gonna be
Caleb's header.

08:37.914 --> 08:40.508
Oh. She never told me.

08:40.683 --> 08:42.811
What, you guys
tell each other everything?

08:42.986 --> 08:45.181
Well, no. Obviously not.

08:46.122 --> 08:49.182
Well, don't you dare tell her
how much I like kissing you.

08:54.831 --> 08:56.992
I don't see any sign of a horse.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.364
No pen. No shelter.

08:59.469 --> 09:03.838
Like I said,
he's more like a companion.

09:06.543 --> 09:10.843
Come back here!
You little rascal!

09:12.616 --> 09:13.810
He hates baths.

09:14.851 --> 09:17.547
The second I start to fill up
the tub, he's out of there.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.591
I thought you said
she was visually impaired.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.058
It comes and goes.

09:25.161 --> 09:28.153
But she is almost
completely 100% deaf.

09:28.765 --> 09:33.532
Well, that's a bit
of an exaggeration, isn't it, Lou?

09:33.637 --> 09:35.332
She must be having a good day.

09:35.438 --> 09:37.201
Or a bad one.

09:37.307 --> 09:40.936
Not only is she keeping livestock
in contravention of the bylaw,

09:41.044 --> 09:43.035
but she's keeping it
in her domicile,

09:43.146 --> 09:45.046
which raises red flags
all over the place.

09:45.181 --> 09:46.443
Red flags?

09:46.549 --> 09:48.039
I'm afraid I have no choice

09:48.151 --> 09:50.676
but to report Mrs. Bell
to Social Services.

09:50.787 --> 09:52.345
What? What does that mean?

09:52.455 --> 09:54.946
It means Mrs. Bell
might be better off

09:55.058 --> 09:57.322
in an assisted-living facility.

09:57.427 --> 09:59.156
An old-age home?

09:59.262 --> 10:00.957
That is not gonna happen, okay?

10:01.064 --> 10:03.123
And you know,
as for your stupid bylaw...

10:03.233 --> 10:05.793
She will have 30 days
to file an appeal.

10:05.902 --> 10:07.062
But I warn you.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.230
That can be a very expensive
and time-consuming process.

10:10.340 --> 10:12.035
You will be hearing from my lawyer.

10:12.142 --> 10:13.575
Our lawyer.

10:13.677 --> 10:15.076
Definitely a lawyer.

10:17.180 --> 10:21.446
This was an all-out endurance race
across some pretty tough terrain.

10:21.551 --> 10:23.781
Grandpa, you really need
to let this go.

10:23.887 --> 10:25.912
I put this behind me years ago.

10:26.022 --> 10:29.890
It's just that Ty needs to know
how it really happened

10:29.993 --> 10:32.791
before your father
starts rewriting history.

10:32.896 --> 10:35.729
Now, my strategy
was to get in the lead...

10:35.832 --> 10:37.595
And stay in the lead.

10:38.902 --> 10:41.393
We come up on Plummers Road.
About here.

10:41.504 --> 10:43.734
And your father was here.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.104
And Scott was right behind him.

10:46.209 --> 10:48.404
Scott? Scott was in the race?

10:48.511 --> 10:50.775
- He's the mustard.
- Obviously.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.711
- Sure.
- It was his first time out.

10:52.816 --> 10:55.080
But he was a contender
'cause he could ride.

10:55.185 --> 11:00.452
When I got to Three Point Creek,
I looked behind me.

11:00.557 --> 11:02.047
Tim was gone.

11:02.225 --> 11:04.557
And when I broke out of the trees...

11:05.762 --> 11:07.195
...he's ahead of me.

11:08.998 --> 11:10.056
He never passed me.

11:10.166 --> 11:12.361
Just magically appeared
in front of me.

11:12.469 --> 11:14.562
But, Grandpa, how could
that possibly happen?

11:14.671 --> 11:16.502
Yeah, Grandpa. How?

11:16.606 --> 11:18.836
He cut corners. That's how.

11:18.942 --> 11:21.410
Went off course
somewhere in the woods.

11:21.544 --> 11:23.603
- Yeah.
- Why wasn't he disqualified, then?

11:23.713 --> 11:25.078
"Teflon" Tim?

11:25.181 --> 11:28.275
That man is so slick
that nothing ever sticks to him.

11:28.384 --> 11:30.750
Okay, so how much money
was at stake in this derby?

11:30.854 --> 11:33.414
It wasn't about money.
It was a charity race.

11:33.523 --> 11:37.323
The real action?
Real action was under the table.

11:37.427 --> 11:39.395
Really? How much did you raise?

11:39.496 --> 11:41.191
Well, over the years,
pretty well enough

11:41.297 --> 11:44.664
to build a whole new trauma wing
on the Hudson County Hospital.

11:44.768 --> 11:47.066
That's a good thing, too.
'Cause that damn race...

11:47.170 --> 11:50.230
That's the reason Stumpy
got the name Stumpy.

11:50.340 --> 11:54.333
Had no idea that crazy race
was all about doing good.

11:54.444 --> 11:56.241
If you call a knock-down,
drag-'em-out,

11:56.346 --> 11:58.780
no-holds-barred grudge match
doing good,

11:58.882 --> 12:00.816
then I guess it was.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.555
Oh, my God!

12:12.662 --> 12:14.823
Mrs. Stanton.

12:19.702 --> 12:21.033
Would Ashley be in?

12:21.137 --> 12:23.128
I'm pretty sure I'd know if she was.

12:23.239 --> 12:25.298
It's not like someone
could hide out in there.

12:25.408 --> 12:28.241
Well, I guess
this would be my chance

12:28.344 --> 12:31.711
to talk to the young man
my daughter is shacked up with.

12:31.815 --> 12:33.146
It's not like that.

12:33.316 --> 12:34.112
Mmm.

12:34.217 --> 12:37.015
Like you said, not much room
for privacy in there.

12:37.153 --> 12:40.645
Would you like to come in?
Coffee? Beer?

12:40.757 --> 12:43.590
Thank you, but no.

12:45.228 --> 12:47.059
Don't tell me you're a bull rider.

12:47.163 --> 12:50.257
Oh, no. Not planning
on dying young, so...

12:50.366 --> 12:52.061
I'm sticking to broncs.

12:52.202 --> 12:53.260
Ah.

12:53.369 --> 12:56.065
Yeah. A couple more wins,
and I'm turning pro.

12:56.172 --> 12:57.605
You must be pretty good at it,
then, huh?

12:57.707 --> 12:59.197
Yeah. That and roping.

12:59.309 --> 13:01.800
My only problem is
I got to hook up with some sponsors

13:01.911 --> 13:04.505
if I want to follow
the circuit south come winter.

13:04.614 --> 13:06.582
Sounds like you've got your future
all worked out.

13:06.683 --> 13:08.378
Yes, I do.

13:08.551 --> 13:10.075
And to think I was worried
that my daughter

13:10.186 --> 13:11.380
was involved with someone

13:11.487 --> 13:14.183
whose aspirations didn't go
beyond working as a ranch hand

13:14.290 --> 13:15.450
living in a rented trailer.

13:15.558 --> 13:18.288
No, Ma'am. I saw that movie,
and I don't like how it ends.

13:19.562 --> 13:23.157
Okay. Well, I guess
I better be going.

13:23.266 --> 13:25.962
Tell my daughter to call me, okay?

13:26.102 --> 13:28.593
I haven't talked to her in days.

13:28.705 --> 13:30.536
Don't worry about Ashley, Ma'am.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.438
I'm taking real good care of her.

13:48.124 --> 13:50.888
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!
Turn on the TV!

13:50.994 --> 13:53.121
Where's the fire, Lou?

13:53.229 --> 13:54.821
Quick. Come on. Come on.

13:55.465 --> 13:56.454
<i>That"s right, Shelley.</i>

13:56.566 --> 13:58.295
Oh, my God! Lou, it's you!

13:58.401 --> 14:00.892
<i>Many seniors in our community
are denied the right</i>

14:01.004 --> 14:03.131
<i>to keep companion animals
in their homes.</i>

14:03.239 --> 14:05.537
<i>So we're raising money
for a legal defense fund</i>

14:05.642 --> 14:07.906
<i>by resurrecting a Hudson tradition...</i>

14:08.011 --> 14:09.774
<i>the Hudson Charity Derby.</i>

14:09.879 --> 14:11.437
<i>And viewers
can get more information</i>

14:11.547 --> 14:15.677
<i>by calling the information hotline
right here.</i>

14:16.486 --> 14:18.351
<i>Good luck with your efforts.
And I really hope the event...</i>

14:19.188 --> 14:22.919
See? The phones are
already ringing off the hook!

14:24.827 --> 14:27.990
Hudson Charity Derby
information hotline.

14:28.097 --> 14:30.725
Yes, this is Lou Fleming.

14:30.833 --> 14:34.234
What am I wearing?
Excuse me?

14:35.004 --> 14:36.130
Oh!

14:41.678 --> 14:43.009
Well, Lou.

14:43.112 --> 14:46.138
Seeing as the last time
the title was stolen from me,

14:46.249 --> 14:49.184
allow me to be the first one
to sign up.

14:49.352 --> 14:50.319
Come on, Grandpa.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.388
Do you really want
to go through all that again?

14:52.488 --> 14:54.683
Damn right I do.

14:54.791 --> 14:57.624
Okay. Okay.

14:57.727 --> 15:01.993
Just fill out this form and give me
a check for the entry fee.

15:04.167 --> 15:06.101
That's a little steep.

15:06.202 --> 15:08.397
You know, Grandpa,
you don't have to race.

15:08.504 --> 15:10.062
You could make a donation.

15:10.173 --> 15:12.471
You could be a judge.

15:12.575 --> 15:15.339
That would be a great help.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.207
What is this?

15:19.315 --> 15:23.251
Oh, I ran into Dad on the way back
from the interview.

15:23.353 --> 15:28.086
And I guess you could say
he beat you to it.

15:28.858 --> 15:30.758
Is that right?

15:32.128 --> 15:38.692
Well, that'll be the last time
Tim Fleming beats me at anything.

15:48.111 --> 15:50.671
Oh, my.

15:52.881 --> 15:55.748
So, what are you saying, Dad?
You and Grandpa, rematch?

15:55.850 --> 15:57.681
That's exactly
what I want to talk to you about.

15:57.786 --> 16:00.118
I've been doing
pretty well lately, but...

16:00.222 --> 16:02.622
My shoulder still stings a bit.

16:02.724 --> 16:04.692
Yeah. Maybe it's trying
to tell you something.

16:04.793 --> 16:06.454
Like you should have
never entered that race.

16:06.561 --> 16:08.028
Well, maybe.
But I can't back out now.

16:08.129 --> 16:09.619
Your grandpa's already entered.

16:09.731 --> 16:12.598
Lou almost had me
talked out of it.

16:13.668 --> 16:16.000
My knees do get a bit stiff
this time of year.

16:16.104 --> 16:21.406
But then I see Tim's name
right at the top of the entry list.

16:21.509 --> 16:23.374
It's not too late to back out, Jack.

16:23.478 --> 16:26.504
Back out?
The entry fee's nonrefundable.

16:26.615 --> 16:29.584
Besides, this old firebrand
right here...

16:29.684 --> 16:31.879
He might not be as young
as he used to be,

16:31.987 --> 16:34.751
but he's still got
a burning desire to win.

16:34.856 --> 16:36.084
I figure I got a winning horse.

16:36.191 --> 16:39.752
But I haven't been able to get him up
to more than a walk lately because...

16:39.861 --> 16:41.692
The darn bullet wound.

16:41.796 --> 16:42.854
Yeah.

16:42.964 --> 16:46.058
So, I was kind of hoping
that you'd leg him up,

16:46.167 --> 16:47.896
get him in racing shape.

16:48.003 --> 16:50.733
Because I know that I have
one good ride in me.

16:50.839 --> 16:52.864
I just don't want to blow it
before the race.

16:52.974 --> 16:57.104
My strategy is to take it easy,
take it slow.

16:57.212 --> 17:00.079
I don't want to wear this guy out
before race day.

17:00.181 --> 17:02.843
So, you're saying that this horse
might be too old for the suicide race,

17:02.951 --> 17:03.815
but you're not?

17:03.952 --> 17:07.217
I don't win this race,
Tim will never let me live it down.

17:08.256 --> 17:10.781
Come on, Jack. The derby
was what, 10, 12 years ago?

17:10.892 --> 17:13.622
No. It goes back
a lot further than that.

17:13.728 --> 17:17.686
Tim Fleming's been keeping score
ever since the Claresholm rodeo.

17:17.799 --> 17:20.393
He beat me on a technicality.

17:20.502 --> 17:23.198
And he's been dining out on it
ever since.

17:23.305 --> 17:24.602
Claresholm rodeo.

17:24.705 --> 17:27.698
Your grandpa got a 10-second penalty
for breaking a barrier.

17:27.809 --> 17:29.777
Somehow he figured
that was my fault.

17:29.878 --> 17:32.870
He hasn't had a kind word to say
about me from that day forward.

17:32.981 --> 17:35.279
I'm riding in that derby
whether you help me or not.

17:35.383 --> 17:37.681
- Even if it kills you?
- Whose side are you on?

17:38.687 --> 17:40.348
Yours.

17:40.455 --> 17:42.582
Just don't let your grandpa find out.

17:46.294 --> 17:47.556
Sure you don't want a leg up, Jack?

17:47.662 --> 17:50.893
No, I don't want a leg up.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.893
Okay, maybe just this once.

17:54.002 --> 17:57.335
But if you tell Tim...

18:00.709 --> 18:02.404
You know, Jack,
I really admire you.

18:03.611 --> 18:06.375
I just hope when I'm your age,
I'm half as stupid as you are.

18:10.752 --> 18:13.743
I'm glad you didn't bring
any more county officials

18:13.855 --> 18:15.345
to my house, Lou.

18:15.457 --> 18:17.891
I swear, if I had for one second

18:17.992 --> 18:20.290
thought that it would turn out
the way it did...

18:20.395 --> 18:23.228
But don't worry.
I'm taking care of everything.

18:23.331 --> 18:26.232
Please, dear.
You don't have to do that.

18:26.334 --> 18:28.564
And I know how
to raise money for you.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.763
We're going to run
the Hudson Derby.

18:30.872 --> 18:32.840
They canceled that race years ago.

18:32.941 --> 18:35.000
I know, Mrs. Bell.
That's what I'm saying.

18:35.110 --> 18:36.372
We're doing it again.

18:36.478 --> 18:39.140
And I want you to drop the flag
on derby day.

18:39.247 --> 18:40.373
Fine.

18:40.482 --> 18:44.111
But don't tell your father
or your grandfather about that race,

18:44.219 --> 18:48.986
or it'll be history repeating itself
all over again.

19:01.102 --> 19:03.468
You okay, Jack?
Been gone a long time.

19:03.571 --> 19:05.198
Yeah, I'm okay.

19:05.306 --> 19:07.968
It's the horse that needed a break.

19:08.076 --> 19:11.068
You want to take my truck?
I'll walk him back.

19:11.179 --> 19:13.113
I still got a fire in my belly.

19:13.214 --> 19:16.183
But to tell you the truth,
my feet are freezing.

19:17.719 --> 19:19.619
As for that old guy, well...

19:22.090 --> 19:25.423
I think the fire's gone out.

19:34.202 --> 19:35.726
You know, your mom came by.

19:35.837 --> 19:38.772
My mom?
What did she want?

19:38.873 --> 19:42.934
I don't know. I think she just
wanted to talk to me.

19:43.044 --> 19:45.069
You know,
she seemed pretty decent.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.704
Weird.

19:46.815 --> 19:49.113
Yeah, ever since
she's had these tests,

19:49.217 --> 19:51.310
she's making it really hard
for me to keep hating her.

19:51.419 --> 19:53.353
You're not thinking
about moving back home, are you?

19:53.455 --> 19:54.513
What?

19:54.622 --> 19:57.147
And trade all this in
for indoor plumbing,

19:57.258 --> 20:00.250
central heating,
and satellite TV?

20:00.361 --> 20:03.489
Look, just because I don't hate her
doesn't mean I want to live with her.

20:04.432 --> 20:05.399
Well, good.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.934
'Cause your coffee's
getting a lot better.

20:08.036 --> 20:10.527
Kind of like not having
to make it on my own.

20:14.676 --> 20:17.270
- Do you have a minute?
- Uh-huh.

20:17.378 --> 20:20.347
Just there's a couple of things
that I...

20:20.448 --> 20:24.009
I kind of don't know
what to do about.

20:24.118 --> 20:25.016
Yes.

20:25.119 --> 20:27.883
And while you're talking to me,
you can fold these.

20:27.989 --> 20:30.685
I am serious, Lou.

20:30.792 --> 20:31.781
Just...

20:31.893 --> 20:34.862
Caleb, he wants me to go
to the rodeo with him this weekend.

20:34.963 --> 20:37.625
But I've got this report
on soil erosion due.

20:37.732 --> 20:41.224
And, you know, I don't think
I could spend four hours in a truck

20:41.336 --> 20:42.530
with Ty and Kit.

20:42.637 --> 20:46.698
I mean, all that hugging and smiling
and those cute little jokes.

20:46.808 --> 20:48.002
It makes me sick.

20:48.109 --> 20:49.474
And on top of it all,

20:49.577 --> 20:51.169
Dad asked me
to work his horse for him.

20:51.279 --> 20:54.544
I said yes, but I don't think
he should even be in the race.

20:55.016 --> 20:56.847
Lou, you're not even
paying attention to me.

20:56.951 --> 21:00.045
Ditch Caleb. Help Dad.
Do your homework.

21:00.154 --> 21:03.681
And don't make yourself miserable
hanging out with Ty and Kit.

21:03.791 --> 21:06.726
You can tell
it makes me miserable?

21:06.828 --> 21:09.695
Oh, my God. Do you think
they know it makes me miserable?

21:09.797 --> 21:12.493
When you're finished folding those,
you can put them in these envelopes.

21:14.836 --> 21:16.133
Easy, boy.

21:16.237 --> 21:18.205
- See this?
- Yeah?

21:18.306 --> 21:22.265
He's got to be
about 15, 16 years old.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.646
And he's got a tattoo.

21:27.749 --> 21:29.046
What does that mean?

21:29.183 --> 21:32.118
Means he's a thoroughbred,
and he was on the track.

21:32.220 --> 21:33.380
He's a racehorse?

21:33.488 --> 21:36.252
Well, he raced at least once.

21:36.357 --> 21:40.225
But don't get your hopes up.
Doesn't mean he was any good at it.

21:40.328 --> 21:42.922
A lot of horses
only have one race in them.

21:43.031 --> 21:45.556
Hey, Jack was said you were
in the derby last year they ran it.

21:45.667 --> 21:47.794
Said you were a real contender.

21:47.902 --> 21:51.133
I was barely 18, you know?
Didn't know what fear was.

21:51.239 --> 21:53.332
All I was thinking about
was winning the race

21:53.441 --> 21:54.533
so that Lou would realize

21:54.642 --> 21:57.008
that I wasn't just
one of her mom's projects.

21:57.111 --> 21:58.942
So, what are you thinking now?

21:59.981 --> 22:03.974
Well, I'm thinking that you should
check this horse's racing stats

22:04.152 --> 22:05.585
before you get Jack's hopes up.

22:05.687 --> 22:07.416
How do you know
this is about Jack?

22:07.522 --> 22:09.956
Well, I was a couple of lengths
behind Tim

22:10.058 --> 22:12.322
when he crossed
that finish line first.

22:12.427 --> 22:15.863
I've been reliving that moment
ever since then.

22:15.964 --> 22:17.295
I only came in third.

22:21.102 --> 22:23.570
Think these are yours.

22:23.671 --> 22:25.434
I found them in the dryer.

22:25.540 --> 22:28.566
You know, stuck.

22:28.843 --> 22:30.333
Thanks.

22:31.279 --> 22:33.247
Hey, um...

22:33.348 --> 22:35.043
I can't...

22:35.149 --> 22:37.447
I can't go with you this weekend
to the rodeo.

22:37.552 --> 22:39.213
I'm sure you'll still do good.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.719
Probably even better without me

22:40.822 --> 22:42.881
'cause I haven't had
a chance to practice.

22:42.991 --> 22:44.583
Well, there's still a few more days.

22:45.693 --> 22:48.423
I know. I just can't, okay?

22:48.529 --> 22:51.225
It's my dad.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.659
I promised my dad
I'd help him with something.

22:54.769 --> 22:57.397
Yeah, well, what about me?
You promised you'd rope with me.

22:57.505 --> 22:58.870
I already signed you up.

22:58.973 --> 23:00.736
I'm sorry.

23:00.842 --> 23:03.276
I don't believe this.
I was counting on you.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.980
At least you got your boxers back.

23:20.762 --> 23:22.730
Whoa.

23:28.403 --> 23:30.871
His real name is You're So Money.

23:30.972 --> 23:33.463
He raced 12 times,
and he won three of them.

23:33.574 --> 23:36.202
I think his racing days
are long over.

23:36.310 --> 23:38.335
The same could be said
for you, Jack.

23:38.446 --> 23:42.382
Okay, Money.
Let's see what you got.

23:44.719 --> 23:45.947
Holy crap!

23:49.724 --> 23:51.919
I told you, Jack!

24:01.568 --> 24:04.366
Boy, I've ridden some good horses
in my day, fast horses,

24:04.471 --> 24:05.870
but this guy!

24:05.973 --> 24:07.804
I thought I had him in overdrive.

24:07.908 --> 24:10.001
He still had a couple of gears left.

24:10.110 --> 24:11.509
So, we got ourselves
a winner, then?

24:11.612 --> 24:14.012
Well, we've got some natural talent,
that's for sure.

24:14.114 --> 24:16.082
But it's got to be molded.

24:16.183 --> 24:17.548
All right.

24:17.651 --> 24:18.982
Wait. What does that mean?

24:19.086 --> 24:22.954
That means that we lope.
We breeze. We run him.

24:23.056 --> 24:25.388
We do some hills.
We practice starts.

24:25.492 --> 24:29.189
And we feed him exactly right
so he peaks on race day.

24:29.296 --> 24:31.161
But I'm gonna need
your help on this.

24:31.265 --> 24:32.323
You count me in.

24:32.499 --> 24:35.024
Yes, sir.

24:35.135 --> 24:38.161
This guy is our secret weapon.

24:38.272 --> 24:40.467
Emphasis on the "secret."

24:41.809 --> 24:43.902
And what are you two
so happy about?

24:45.212 --> 24:46.042
Oh, nothing.

24:46.146 --> 24:47.272
Nothing.

24:47.414 --> 24:48.642
Wait a minute.

24:48.782 --> 24:50.443
Isn't that your...?

24:50.551 --> 24:53.179
You are training your dad's horse.

24:53.287 --> 24:55.755
Well, I just...

24:56.490 --> 24:59.118
At least now I know
whose side of the fence you're on.

24:59.226 --> 25:00.625
Grandpa!

25:00.727 --> 25:01.785
Not that I care.

25:01.895 --> 25:06.628
Believe me, Tim Fleming
needs all the help he can get.

25:12.105 --> 25:14.699
If I was conditioning a horse
for an endurance race,

25:14.808 --> 25:16.275
I'd buy this.

25:16.376 --> 25:20.039
Front Runner.
I like the sound of that.

25:20.147 --> 25:23.480
And you'll need these, too.

25:25.385 --> 25:26.352
Right.

25:26.453 --> 25:29.854
Now for ourselves.
I was thinking pie and coffee.

25:29.957 --> 25:32.187
Apple pie.

25:37.397 --> 25:38.762
Hey, there, stranger.

25:38.866 --> 25:40.197
Hi, Scott.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.393
Saw your truck outside.

25:42.503 --> 25:43.800
Hey.

25:43.904 --> 25:44.928
Yeah.

25:45.038 --> 25:46.733
I was actually meaning to call you.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.637
You see, the thing is
something came up,

25:48.742 --> 25:51.575
and I can't go with you
to the rodeo this weekend.

25:51.712 --> 25:54.044
Oh, no.
I hope it's nothing serious.

25:54.147 --> 25:56.081
No, actually.
Well, maybe. But...

25:56.183 --> 25:57.844
I just made a promise.

25:57.951 --> 26:00.078
Yeah, to me.

26:00.187 --> 26:04.624
Yeah. But I also made a promise
to Jack.

26:04.725 --> 26:06.056
It's about his horse.

26:06.159 --> 26:07.854
Why doesn't Amy take care of it?

26:07.961 --> 26:10.361
I don't know.
I think she's going to the rodeo.

26:11.632 --> 26:13.691
That's funny,
'cause Caleb just told me

26:13.800 --> 26:15.461
that she's not going either.

26:16.336 --> 26:17.803
That's the first I've heard.

26:17.905 --> 26:19.770
Why don't I believe you?

26:19.873 --> 26:20.862
Come on, Kit.

26:21.008 --> 26:23.067
Is there still something
going on with you two?

26:23.176 --> 26:25.804
This isn't about Amy.
It's about Jack.

26:27.581 --> 26:31.483
But, hey, I know you'll do great
at the rodeo.

26:31.585 --> 26:33.917
Yeah, thanks.

26:41.628 --> 26:43.653
Ah.

26:44.665 --> 26:46.826
Feeding him the good stuff, I see.

26:46.934 --> 26:49.095
Yeah, nothing but the best.

26:49.202 --> 26:52.763
You mind saving some of that
for my dad's horse?

26:52.906 --> 26:54.100
Oh.

26:54.207 --> 26:55.196
Sorry.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.971
It's like you said.
This guy's my special project.

27:00.847 --> 27:02.974
Well, that's just too bad.

27:03.083 --> 27:05.244
'Cause soon as you leave
for that rodeo this weekend,

27:05.352 --> 27:06.250
that bag's mine.

27:06.353 --> 27:08.412
Maybe I'm not going to the rodeo.

27:08.522 --> 27:10.046
Yeah, maybe I'm not either.

27:12.559 --> 27:13.856
Wait. You're not going?

27:14.861 --> 27:17.659
No. Now Kit's
kind of mad at me, so...

27:17.764 --> 27:21.063
Yeah. Me and Caleb, same thing.

27:21.168 --> 27:22.499
So, how come you're not going?

27:23.971 --> 27:25.996
No reason.
How about you?

27:27.374 --> 27:29.001
No reason.

27:29.710 --> 27:31.177
You're so full of it.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.870
And you aren't?

27:33.981 --> 27:37.644
Okay. So we both know
we're backing different horses.

27:37.751 --> 27:41.312
But let's not get sucked into
that whole competitive thing, right?

27:41.421 --> 27:43.889
Yeah. Salt versus pepper.

27:43.991 --> 27:46.186
You could say that.

27:58.772 --> 28:00.137
I won.

28:00.273 --> 28:01.740
What do you mean?
We weren't even racing.

28:01.842 --> 28:03.366
Oh, maybe you weren't.

28:03.477 --> 28:04.535
You mean you were?

28:04.645 --> 28:06.579
Because if you were,
I wasn't even trying.

28:06.680 --> 28:11.413
I wasn't trying either.
But I still won, didn't I?

28:21.495 --> 28:22.985
So, you sure
you don't want to come?

28:23.096 --> 28:24.757
There's plenty of room
in the truck.

28:25.332 --> 28:27.493
Because Amy bailed out on you?

28:27.601 --> 28:29.592
Now, there's an invitation
I can refuse.

28:29.736 --> 28:31.397
Come on, Ash.

28:35.042 --> 28:37.476
Next time. And I promise
I'll ask you first.

28:38.311 --> 28:41.439
I don't get you.
Are you really that oblivious?

28:41.581 --> 28:42.980
Oblivious to what?

28:43.083 --> 28:46.109
Well, Amy bails out on you,
and Ty bails out on Kit?

28:46.219 --> 28:49.086
I mean, do you really think
that's a coincidence?

28:49.189 --> 28:51.123
Okay. Maybe not.

28:51.224 --> 28:52.919
But I can't think about that
right now.

28:53.026 --> 28:55.256
Right now I got to think
about four hours on the road,

28:55.362 --> 28:58.160
eight seconds on a bronc,
and about 7.9 seconds to rope a calf.

28:58.265 --> 28:59.027
Give or take.

28:59.933 --> 29:02.561
Looks like you've got your thinking
pretty well figured out.

29:02.669 --> 29:05.194
Yes, I do.

29:13.380 --> 29:15.075
Is that gonna go up?
I need that to go up.

29:15.182 --> 29:15.807
Oh, hey.

29:15.916 --> 29:19.716
Competitor parking only, please.
General parking back that way.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.344
- Here you go.
- Great. Thanks.

29:22.122 --> 29:23.384
Scott.

29:23.523 --> 29:25.115
I was afraid
you didn't get my message.

29:25.225 --> 29:26.123
Message?

29:26.226 --> 29:28.160
Yeah. You know,
I need a vet on standby.

29:28.261 --> 29:31.560
Wish I could pay you,
but I'm barely breaking even as it is.

29:31.665 --> 29:34.429
I'm not on standby, actually.
I'm a late entry.

29:34.568 --> 29:35.159
Oh.

29:35.268 --> 29:37.759
Another entry.
And a late entry.

29:37.871 --> 29:39.930
I'm gonna have to charge you
a late-entry fee.

29:40.607 --> 29:41.801
Glad to be of help.

29:41.908 --> 29:42.806
Great.

29:42.909 --> 29:44.877
So, Scott Cardinal.

29:44.978 --> 29:47.003
And what is your horse's name?

29:47.948 --> 29:48.937
Eat My Dust.

29:50.350 --> 29:52.045
I like the sound of that.

29:52.152 --> 29:53.676
A C-note on Eat My Dust to win.

29:53.787 --> 29:56.153
Stumpy, you're betting on the race?

29:56.256 --> 29:58.121
Can't ride in it anymore.

29:58.225 --> 30:01.661
Not since the last time.

30:01.762 --> 30:05.254
At least I can make some money.

30:08.468 --> 30:12.199
100 bucks on Eat My Dust to win.

30:12.939 --> 30:15.567
Ladies and gentlemen.
The window is now open.

30:15.675 --> 30:18.303
Place your bets.

30:18.411 --> 30:22.780
Stumpy, you are a genius.

30:23.416 --> 30:25.646
Remember to hold back
until the homestretch.

30:25.752 --> 30:28.516
I already told you,
I like to get the early lead.

30:28.622 --> 30:29.919
And keep it.

30:30.023 --> 30:31.513
I've got all the stats, Jack.

30:31.625 --> 30:33.559
Look.
He's a come-from-behind horse.

30:33.660 --> 30:36.220
It's not my style
to come from behind.

30:36.329 --> 30:40.197
Well, If you want to win this race,
you got to change your style.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.928
Is that right?

30:45.739 --> 30:47.730
Are you sure
you're up for this, Dad?

30:47.841 --> 30:49.638
Yes.

30:49.743 --> 30:51.506
If the horse is up for it.

30:51.611 --> 30:53.306
I still think it's insane.

30:53.413 --> 30:57.179
You know, your prerace pep talk
could use a little work.

30:57.284 --> 30:58.512
I'm just being honest.

30:58.618 --> 31:02.349
Well, don't be honest.
Just say, "Dad, you're gonna win."

31:02.455 --> 31:04.821
And then tell me how to do it.

31:04.925 --> 31:05.949
Okay.

31:06.059 --> 31:08.527
Dad, you're gonna win.
Just go fast.

31:08.628 --> 31:13.691
And if you see Grandpa
coming up behind you, go faster.

31:16.002 --> 31:17.799
All right.
A fiver on You're So Money.

31:17.904 --> 31:19.565
You got it. Good luck.
Short horse to win.

31:19.673 --> 31:21.937
I'm liking the odds
on Jack Bartlett.

31:22.042 --> 31:24.738
And don't forget
about the returning champion,

31:24.845 --> 31:25.971
Tim Fleming.

31:26.079 --> 31:27.706
Amy, I'm short a spotter.

31:27.814 --> 31:28.838
I need you to take this,

31:28.949 --> 31:31.213
get it to the halfway mark
as soon as the race starts.

31:31.318 --> 31:35.220
No, no. She can't be a spotter.
She's been helping the competition.

31:37.023 --> 31:39.082
- All right. Ty, you go.
- Oh, give me a break.

31:39.192 --> 31:41.683
You can't tell me that Ty hasn't
been working with the old man.

31:41.795 --> 31:44.263
Okay. They both go.

31:44.364 --> 31:45.626
Okay.

31:45.732 --> 31:47.199
Okay.

31:47.300 --> 31:49.700
Can pretty much guarantee
they won't be blind drunk.

31:49.803 --> 31:50.861
Okay.

31:50.971 --> 31:53.030
Thanks.

31:53.773 --> 31:55.206
Lou.

31:55.308 --> 31:56.969
Gonna wish me luck?

31:57.077 --> 32:00.478
I would, Dad, but I have to maintain
absolute impartiality.

32:00.580 --> 32:04.346
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,
your odds are really good.

32:08.788 --> 32:09.880
As we all know,

32:09.990 --> 32:14.290
the Hudson Charity Derby
isn't just about winning or losing.

32:15.295 --> 32:17.593
It's about community.

32:17.697 --> 32:19.722
And before I introduce
our official starter,

32:19.833 --> 32:21.232
Mrs. Sally Bell,

32:21.334 --> 32:23.302
I would like to remind you all

32:23.334 --> 32:25.302
that the betting window
is now closed.

32:29.376 --> 32:30.809
On your mark!

32:32.379 --> 32:33.437
Get set!

32:33.914 --> 32:34.642
Go!

32:36.016 --> 32:37.313
Come on, Jack!

32:42.923 --> 32:44.982
Come on, Grandpa!

32:46.426 --> 32:47.324
Come on, Jack!

32:51.331 --> 32:52.923
Come on, Jack!
Let me give you a leg up!

32:53.033 --> 32:54.762
Forget it.
Just hold him still.

32:54.868 --> 32:57.268
- Don't be stubborn, Jack!
- I'm not being stubborn!

32:57.370 --> 33:00.862
It's all part of your stupid
come-from-behind strategy!

33:01.007 --> 33:02.167
Come on, Grandpa!

33:03.777 --> 33:05.005
Go, Jack! Come on!

33:09.049 --> 33:11.074
Come on, Dad!

33:22.661 --> 33:25.858
And at mile one,
it's Dusty Burdick in the lead.

33:33.105 --> 33:35.869
Followed closely behind by Jim.

33:35.975 --> 33:37.169
Slim?

33:37.276 --> 33:38.208
No, Tim.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.904
Tim Fleming.

33:41.013 --> 33:42.071
Go, Dad!

33:48.020 --> 33:48.884
Excuse me?

33:49.421 --> 33:51.150
Oh, Miss Newton.

33:51.256 --> 33:53.588
I understand you're taking bets.

33:53.692 --> 33:55.819
Oh, I'm sorry.
The betting window is now closed.

33:55.928 --> 33:57.520
The race has already started.

33:57.629 --> 34:01.326
You understand parimutuel betting
at amateur sports events

34:01.433 --> 34:04.459
is in contravention
of Hudson County bylaws?

34:04.570 --> 34:07.130
Parimutuel?
I had no idea.

34:07.239 --> 34:09.571
Ignorance is no excuse
for breaking the law.

34:09.675 --> 34:10.539
But...

34:10.641 --> 34:13.509
You'll be hearing from my office.

34:39.138 --> 34:41.902
Here's Tim.
Second place.

34:42.007 --> 34:44.635
And Scott's right behind him.

34:44.743 --> 34:46.301
And Jack's moved into fourth place.

34:47.411 --> 34:49.380
All right, I've just got an update
from the course folks.

34:49.481 --> 34:52.245
They are closing in
on the halfway mark and...

34:52.351 --> 34:54.216
Oh, no.

34:54.319 --> 34:57.220
Tim Fleming has fallen behind.

34:58.390 --> 34:59.982
Ooh, come in, Amy.

35:01.660 --> 35:03.890
<i>Come in.</i>

35:05.264 --> 35:08.665
Amy, are you there?

35:09.535 --> 35:12.003
Yes, they are approaching
the halfway mark.

35:12.104 --> 35:15.972
And they're going really fast.

35:16.075 --> 35:18.043
Damn it, Amy, where are you?
What's going on?

35:18.143 --> 35:18.905
<i>Amy?</i>

35:19.278 --> 35:20.870
Lou, I can't hear you.

35:21.046 --> 35:22.138
Lou!

35:23.015 --> 35:24.778
You know, even when
you can't hear her

35:24.883 --> 35:25.907
or know what she's saying,

35:26.018 --> 35:27.315
you sort of know
what she's saying.

35:27.419 --> 35:29.683
Yeah. Out of all of you,
she's got it the worst.

35:29.788 --> 35:31.915
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, you know.

35:32.024 --> 35:35.289
That crazy competitive thing
that runs in your family.

35:35.394 --> 35:38.454
No. I am way more competitive
than Lou.

35:38.564 --> 35:40.122
Well, why don't you prove it?

35:40.232 --> 35:42.029
All right.
You asked for it.

35:42.134 --> 35:42.930
Bring it on.

35:47.773 --> 35:49.638
Amy, where are you?
What are you two doing?

35:51.577 --> 35:53.511
Help! Help! Help! Help!

35:55.547 --> 35:57.208
Got you!

36:16.802 --> 36:18.099
Go, Scott!

36:18.971 --> 36:20.529
Go, Dad!

36:20.639 --> 36:21.833
Go, Jack!

36:22.774 --> 36:24.105
Yeah! Coming from behind!

36:25.377 --> 36:26.674
Woo!

36:31.049 --> 36:32.016
Hey.

36:37.990 --> 36:40.049
What, you taking a shortcut, Tim?

36:41.660 --> 36:43.252
You never learn, do you?

36:47.399 --> 36:48.832
You all right?

36:48.934 --> 36:50.401
Yeah.

36:52.237 --> 36:54.797
Give me a leg up, will you, Jack?

36:54.907 --> 36:56.841
You just had your shoulder
blown to bits.

36:56.942 --> 36:59.410
I don't know why
you put yourself through this.

36:59.511 --> 37:00.910
You know damn well why.

37:04.216 --> 37:06.707
And this time I'm not gonna
feel guilty about beating you.

37:07.219 --> 37:09.050
Ah, you son of...!

37:11.990 --> 37:15.391
And at the three-quarter pole,
it's still Dusty Burdick.

37:15.494 --> 37:17.394
- Followed by...
- <i>Scott Cardinal.</i>

37:17.496 --> 37:18.588
Scott Cardinal?

37:19.364 --> 37:20.695
What happened to my dad?

37:20.799 --> 37:22.323
And where the hell is my grandpa?

37:22.434 --> 37:24.197
<i>I don't know.</i>

37:27.639 --> 37:30.506
But we don't care
who wins or loses, do we, folks?

37:30.609 --> 37:35.478
Because it's all just fun and games
for a good cause.

37:42.521 --> 37:43.749
See you, Scott.

37:43.855 --> 37:44.879
Everything okay?

37:45.057 --> 37:46.456
Yeah, I'm okay.

37:46.592 --> 37:47.957
Damn it.

37:50.762 --> 37:53.959
Another rider down.
It's anyone's race.

38:04.977 --> 38:06.137
Come on. Come on.

38:15.854 --> 38:17.583
Eat my dust!

38:21.960 --> 38:24.360
Clear the course. They're coming in
for the homestretch.

38:26.632 --> 38:29.829
And here they come.
And in first place it's...

38:29.935 --> 38:32.927
I don't believe it. It's Scott.

38:33.038 --> 38:35.063
Scott Cardinal in first place.

38:35.173 --> 38:37.300
And in second place,
it's Tim Fleming.

38:37.409 --> 38:39.877
No, it's Jack Bartlett.
No, it's a dead heat.

38:39.978 --> 38:41.468
<i>Woo-hoo! It's a tie!</i>

38:41.580 --> 38:45.277
A tie for second place.

38:45.384 --> 38:48.114
Oh, man. Maybe your dad and Jack
will give it a rest now.

38:48.220 --> 38:50.688
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

38:50.789 --> 38:53.019
And now it gives me great pleasure

38:53.125 --> 38:55.719
to present the winner
of this year's Hudson Derby

38:55.827 --> 38:58.853
with an all-inclusive
deluxe weekend package

38:58.964 --> 39:02.923
at the Heartland
Equestrian Connection.

39:04.770 --> 39:06.328
And I would also like to apologize

39:06.438 --> 39:08.531
to those of you
who mistakenly thought

39:08.707 --> 39:10.902
I was running
a parimutuel betting operation

39:11.009 --> 39:13.807
and assure you that your nontaxable
charitable donations

39:13.912 --> 39:17.507
will go straight
to Mrs. Bell's defense fund.

39:17.616 --> 39:18.548
It's for two.

39:18.650 --> 39:20.083
Now all I have to do
is find someone

39:20.185 --> 39:23.848
to spend the weekend with me
at the dude ranch.

39:25.357 --> 39:29.191
Who wants to start the bidding
on a weekend with our big winner?

39:29.294 --> 39:30.852
- I do!
- Do I hear $200?

39:30.962 --> 39:32.930
Over here.

39:33.031 --> 39:34.555
Do I hear four?

39:34.666 --> 39:36.065
Going once. Going twice.

39:36.168 --> 39:37.863
Sold to the woman
in the white hat.

39:37.969 --> 39:39.630
Now, how about his hat, folks?

39:39.805 --> 39:41.932
Let's get some bids
on Scott Cardinal's hat.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.837
- Heck of a race, Scott.
- I've got 30.

39:43.942 --> 39:45.500
Let me be the first
to congratulate you.

39:45.610 --> 39:47.703
Great job, pal. You know
you won it fair and square.

39:47.813 --> 39:49.974
Thanks, guys.
No harm in being number two.

39:52.951 --> 39:54.748
I know why Lou called it a tie.

39:54.853 --> 39:57.413
But you and I both know
the only thing you saw

39:57.522 --> 40:00.457
crossing that finish line
was my horse's ass.

40:00.559 --> 40:02.754
You know,
I think you're right, Tim.

40:02.861 --> 40:05.193
If I looked behind me,
I would have seen you.

40:05.297 --> 40:09.631
Biggest horse's ass
in Hudson County.

40:10.435 --> 40:11.595
Really?

40:14.272 --> 40:16.797
Second in broncs.
First in tie-down roping.

40:16.908 --> 40:18.432
I got enough points
to get my pro card.

40:18.543 --> 40:21.444
Great.
When are you heading south?

40:21.579 --> 40:24.446
I can't go.
I mean, I have to find a sponsor.

40:26.384 --> 40:30.718
Well, that's exactly
why I wanted to meet with you.

40:33.992 --> 40:36.017
Don't show this to my daughter,
all right?

40:36.127 --> 40:37.389
She'll take it the wrong way.

40:42.500 --> 40:43.489
What is this?

40:43.601 --> 40:45.193
Let's just say now you've got

40:45.303 --> 40:47.601
all the sponsorship
you're gonna need.

40:52.343 --> 40:54.538
And so I just...
I wish we made a profit.

40:54.646 --> 40:57.342
But with all the expenses
and the fines,

40:57.448 --> 41:00.474
I don't even think
we're gonna break even.

40:57.797 --> 20:41:09.536
*****... )

41:00.585 --> 41:03.076
Would you like me
to lend you some money, Lou?

41:03.187 --> 41:07.180
Mrs. Bell, you don't understand.
I was trying to raise money for you.

41:07.292 --> 41:08.884
Well, don't worry about me.

41:08.993 --> 41:13.692
My lawyer tells me we already have
that Ms. Newton on the run.

41:13.798 --> 41:15.527
Your lawyer?

41:15.633 --> 41:17.260
I found my glasses, dear.

41:17.368 --> 41:20.599
He was the first person I called
after I read that letter.

41:20.705 --> 41:22.332
You have a lawyer?

41:22.473 --> 41:23.872
And he thinks Sugarfoot

41:23.975 --> 41:26.535
is the cutest little client
he's ever had,

41:26.644 --> 41:28.441
so he's working for free.

41:28.546 --> 41:31.515
Free?

41:31.616 --> 41:34.517
Mrs. Bell, do you have his card?
Can I get his number?

41:34.619 --> 41:38.385
You see, I got this official letter
from Hudson County.

41:45.730 --> 41:49.461
Well, I'm glad to see you were able
to set aside your petty concerns

41:49.567 --> 41:51.558
and accept the hay.

41:51.669 --> 41:54.866
Glad you were able to drop
your price to something reasonable.

41:54.973 --> 41:58.534
Yeah, well, did it for the girls.

41:58.643 --> 42:01.009
So, Jack.

42:01.245 --> 42:03.736
What do you say?
Maybe it's time we bury the hatchet.

42:05.116 --> 42:07.243
First, I'll have to dig it
out of my back.

42:07.352 --> 42:09.843
Come on.
How long we been at this, huh?

42:09.954 --> 42:12.354
Claresholm? Williams Lake?

42:12.457 --> 42:14.015
What are you talking about?

42:14.125 --> 42:15.558
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

42:15.660 --> 42:17.150
I was coming up,
winning all the money.

42:17.261 --> 42:19.024
And you were sliding
in the standings.

42:19.130 --> 42:20.188
The hell I was!

42:20.298 --> 42:21.356
Oh, admit it.

42:21.466 --> 42:24.333
I was the next big thing.
It was my turn.

42:24.435 --> 42:26.198
You didn't even shake my hand.

42:26.337 --> 42:28.669
I barely knew who you were.
Didn't care.

42:28.773 --> 42:30.468
Till my daughter dragged you home

42:30.575 --> 42:32.509
like something stuck
to the bottom of her boot.

42:32.610 --> 42:35.636
Oh, so, you're saying you didn't mind
me beating you all those times?

42:35.747 --> 42:38.545
When you and Marion...

42:42.887 --> 42:45.378
I noticed.

42:45.490 --> 42:49.654
Every time you made the window,
every time you took home a buckle,

42:49.761 --> 42:50.887
I was proud of you.

42:52.830 --> 42:54.730
What do you expect?
You married my daughter.

42:54.832 --> 42:56.265
You were like a son to me.

43:00.271 --> 43:02.136
Like a son?

43:02.240 --> 43:03.537
That's right.

43:03.641 --> 43:09.170
Until you broke her heart,
and it all went south.

43:17.555 --> 43:19.785
Yeah.

43:22.026 --> 43:23.653
I wish it could have
been different, Jack.

43:23.761 --> 43:26.321
Me too.

43:34.806 --> 43:36.967
Okay, I'm gonna
tell you something, Jack.

43:38.576 --> 43:40.271
I'm gonna be very honest here.

43:43.414 --> 43:45.678
When I realized that Scott
was gonna win the race,

43:45.783 --> 43:47.546
I slowed down
so you could catch up.

43:51.122 --> 43:52.783
The hell you did!

44:03.101 --> 44:05.467
So, this time it's for real?

44:05.570 --> 44:06.764
Yeah.

44:06.871 --> 44:09.066
We need to get this out of the way
once and for all.

44:09.173 --> 44:12.836
Okay.
But I want this to be fair.

44:12.944 --> 44:15.708
Do you want a head start?

44:15.980 --> 44:17.072
I don't need one.

44:17.181 --> 44:18.808
Good.

44:19.081 --> 44:21.308
Hey. what happened with fair?
