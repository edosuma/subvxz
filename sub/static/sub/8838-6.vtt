SHOO! SHOO!

01:33.511 --> 01:35.305
[SIGHS]

01:35.472 --> 01:37.682
TIMOTHY, THIS IS
AN EXCELLENT ESSAY.

01:37.849 --> 01:39.851
I'D SAY IT'S
ANOTHER A-PLUS.

01:40.018 --> 01:41.019
THANKS, MISS BEADLE.

01:41.186 --> 01:42.395
YOU KNOW,
I LEARNED THINGS

01:42.562 --> 01:44.272
ABOUT MEDICAL HISTORY
I NEVER KNEW BEFORE.

01:44.439 --> 01:46.608
BUT THEN, YOU'RE
THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO
BE THE DOCTOR, RIGHT?

01:46.775 --> 01:49.235
I WANT TO BE,
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

01:49.402 --> 01:51.529
WELL, THEN,
YOU WILL BE.

01:51.696 --> 01:54.532
MISS BEADLE.
MISS BEADLE.

01:57.494 --> 01:58.578
YES, NELLIE?

01:58.745 --> 02:01.080
LAURA INGALLS ISN'T
READING HER McGUFFEY.

02:01.247 --> 02:02.999
Willie: AND NEITHER
IS ANDREW GARVEY.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.210
THEY'RE HIDING
PENNY DREADFULS.

02:05.376 --> 02:06.795
Laura: SNITCHES!

02:06.961 --> 02:10.423
Miss Beadle:
ALL RIGHT, LET ME SEE
WHAT YOU'RE READING.

02:11.549 --> 02:14.052
"THE BLEEDING HAND
STRIKES BACK."

02:14.219 --> 02:16.763
"MURDER ON THE MOORS."

02:16.930 --> 02:19.599
"THE FABULOUS ADVENTURES
OF FARNSDALE FREMONT,

02:19.766 --> 02:21.851
MASTER SLEUTH
OF SCOTLAND YARD"?

02:22.018 --> 02:24.771
THIS MR. FREMONT
SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY
EXCITING CHARACTER.

02:24.938 --> 02:27.190
EXCITING?
HE'S FABULOUS!

02:27.357 --> 02:28.775
HE'S NOT McGUFFEY.

02:28.942 --> 02:31.486
SHE KNOWS THAT,
NELLIE-TELLIE!

02:31.653 --> 02:33.947
ARE YOU GONNA KEEP
THEM AFTER SCHOOL,
MISS BEADLE?

02:34.113 --> 02:36.282
Miss Beadle: WELL,
WILLIE, I DON'T SEE
WHY I SHOULD.

02:36.449 --> 02:38.409
I MEAN, THEY WERE
READING, WEREN'T THEY?

02:38.576 --> 02:40.495
I MEAN, IT DOES IMPROVE
THEIR VOCABULARY,

02:40.662 --> 02:43.998
ALTHOUGH I DON'T SEE
WHAT GOOD IT'S GONNA
DO AROUND WALNUT GROVE.

02:44.165 --> 02:46.292
ALL RIGHT. NOT IN SCHOOL
ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?

02:46.459 --> 02:48.503

THAT-A BOY. YEAH.

03:08.940 --> 03:10.817
GOOD BOY. YEAH.

03:12.235 --> 03:15.321
I'VE BEEN ROBBED!
THAT'S THE SECOND TIME
THIS WEEK.

03:15.488 --> 03:17.782
THAT DEFINITELY
PROVES ONE THING.

03:17.949 --> 03:18.825
WHAT?

03:18.992 --> 03:21.160
SOMEBODY LIKES
YOUR MA'S COOKING.

03:21.327 --> 03:22.829
WELL, SO DO I!

03:22.996 --> 03:25.707
WHEN I CAN GET IT.

03:25.874 --> 03:27.625
THANKS.

03:36.175 --> 03:37.719
I THINK THIS ONE WILL DO.

03:37.886 --> 03:39.512
OH, FINE.
THAT'S 28 CENTS.

03:39.679 --> 03:42.348
IT SEEMS KIND OF
SILLY LOCKING UP
THE SMOKEHOUSE

03:42.515 --> 03:44.017
AFTER THE HENS
IS GONE ANYHOW.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.268
CLEAN YOU OUT?

03:45.435 --> 03:47.520
NO. HE JUST GOT TWO,
ONE AT A TIME.

03:47.687 --> 03:50.940
MIGHTY CONSIDERATE
THIEF, BUT TWO HENS
IS TWO TOO MANY.

03:51.107 --> 03:53.109
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THERE HAS BEEN

03:53.276 --> 03:55.653
QUITE A RASH OF THEFTS
ROUNDABOUTS LATELY.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.822
THE WAY I HEAR IT,
THEY'VE ONLY BEEN
TAKING FOODSTUFFS.

03:57.989 --> 04:00.533
AH, TIME WAS, A MAN COULD
LEAVE HIS DOOR UNLATCHED

04:00.700 --> 04:02.160
AND NOT WORRY
ABOUT THIEVERY.

04:02.327 --> 04:03.870
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THINGS ARE COMING TO.

04:04.037 --> 04:07.373
AH...WELL, IT'S A SHAME,
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

04:07.540 --> 04:10.960
BUT OUR LOCKS HAVE BEEN
SELLING LIKE HOTCAKES.

04:11.127 --> 04:13.504
WELL, AIN'T NOTHING
SO BAD THAT THERE

04:13.671 --> 04:15.632
CAN'T BE SOME GOOD
OUT OF IT. NELS.

04:15.798 --> 04:17.050
GOOD DAY, JONATHAN.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.093
[HUMMING]

04:19.260 --> 04:20.720
THIS KEEPS UP...

04:20.887 --> 04:23.181
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
ORDER SOME MORE LOCKS.

04:23.348 --> 04:25.433
OH! WELL, I HOPE SO.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.392
WHAT?

04:26.559 --> 04:28.061
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU HOPE

04:28.227 --> 04:29.729
THAT THESE
ROBBERIES CONTINUE?

04:29.896 --> 04:32.941
WELL, LAND'S SAKES, NELS,
I'M NOT COMMITTING THEM.

04:33.107 --> 04:36.110
I'M JUST TRYING TO LOOK
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THINGS.

04:36.277 --> 04:39.572
IF PEOPLE CONTINUE
TO BE ROBBED,
WE'RE MAKING MONEY.

04:39.739 --> 04:41.282
AND IF THIS DEMAND CONTINUES,

04:41.449 --> 04:43.409
I THINK WE SHOULD
RAISE THE PRICE.

04:43.576 --> 04:46.245
HARRIET!
WE CANNOT PROFITEER

04:46.412 --> 04:48.957
ON OUR NEIGHBORS'
MISFORTUNES.

04:49.123 --> 04:53.044
NELS, YOU ARE LOOKING
AT IT ALL WRONG.

04:53.211 --> 04:56.255
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO LOOK AT IT?

04:56.422 --> 04:58.591
WE ARE HELPING PEOPLE.

04:58.758 --> 05:01.594
WE ARE SAVING THEM MONEY
BY SELLING THEM LOCKS,

05:01.761 --> 05:04.138
WHICH KEEPS THEIR GOODS
FROM BEING STOLEN.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.348
EH?

05:05.515 --> 05:09.060
YOU KNOW, HARRIET,
YOUR TROUBLE IS,

05:09.227 --> 05:12.355
YOU'RE ALWAYS THINKING
OF OTHER PEOPLE.

05:12.522 --> 05:14.774
[SIGHS]
I KNOW IT, NELS.

05:14.941 --> 05:19.445
TROUBLE IS, I HAVE TOO SOFT
A HEART FOR MY OWN GOOD.

05:19.612 --> 05:21.364
[QUIETLY]
HARD AS A ROCK.

05:21.531 --> 05:22.490
WHAT?

05:22.657 --> 05:24.659
I SAID I'VE GOT TO
CHECK THE STOCK.

05:24.826 --> 05:26.828
AH.
[HUMMING]

05:33.126 --> 05:35.837
YOU KNOW, THAT
MUST BE ONE HUNGRY
KIND OF THIEF.

05:36.004 --> 05:37.964
HE'S NOT HUNGRY.
I AM!

05:38.131 --> 05:39.882
I GAVE YOU
HALF MY LUNCH.

05:40.049 --> 05:41.968
SO, I'M ONLY
HALF-STARVED.

05:42.135 --> 05:44.637
MAYBE WE OUGHT
TO BE LOOKING
FOR A FAT THIEF.

05:44.804 --> 05:47.974
YEAH, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
POP, THE CREEPER--

05:48.141 --> 05:52.061
OH, THAT'S WHAT
WE DECIDED TO CALL
THE MYSTERIOUS MARAUDER--

05:52.228 --> 05:56.566
THE CREEPER
COULD BE SOMEBODY
THIN WITH WORMS.

05:56.733 --> 05:58.484
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, ANDY?

05:58.651 --> 06:02.155
YOU'RE GETTING TO BE MORE
LIKE FREMONT EVERY DAY.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.045
WELL,
GOOD AFTERNOON,
TIMOTHY.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.838
WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU?

06:19.005 --> 06:22.008
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'RE HIRING YET.

06:22.175 --> 06:24.010
OH, YOU DIDN'T
GET A JOB YET?

06:24.177 --> 06:27.972
I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER.
THERE JUST DON'T SEEM
TO BE ANY OPENINGS.

06:28.139 --> 06:32.018
YEAH, WELL,
THINGS ARE PRETTY
TIGHT AROUND HERE.

06:32.185 --> 06:33.978
I WISH I COULD HELP,

06:34.145 --> 06:36.355
BUT THERE JUST
ISN'T THE WORK.

06:36.522 --> 06:37.982
YEAH, I KNOW.

06:38.149 --> 06:40.359
WELL, THANKS ANYWAY,
MR. HANSON.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.487
BUT IF I HEAR
OF ANYTHING,

06:42.653 --> 06:44.489

07:09.055 --> 07:09.972
TIMOTHY.

07:10.139 --> 07:12.266
JUST GOT BACK FROM
VISITING YOUR FATHER.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.893
HOW DO YOU
THINK HE'S DOING?

07:14.060 --> 07:17.396
AS WELL AS CAN BE
EXPECTED AFTER A HEART
ATTACK LIKE HIS.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.398
IT JUST TAKES TIME,
TIMOTHY.

07:19.565 --> 07:22.026
HE NEEDS REST,
NO EXERTION WHATSOEVER,

07:22.193 --> 07:25.404
AND PLENTY OF GOOD,
SOLID FOOD TO BUILD
HIS STRENGTH BACK.

07:25.571 --> 07:28.282
BUT YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL
AS I DO, DON'T YOU?

07:28.449 --> 07:31.577
YOU'VE READ
PRACTICALLY EVERY BOOK
IN MY MEDICAL LIBRARY.

07:31.744 --> 07:33.412
JUST ABOUT.

07:42.046 --> 07:45.049

EXAMINATION'S COMING
UP PRETTY SOON.

07:45.216 --> 07:46.843
THINK YOU'RE
READY FOR IT?

07:47.009 --> 07:48.094
I HOPE SO.

07:48.261 --> 07:50.179
MISS BEADLE'S BEEN GIVING
ME SPECIAL TUTORING,

07:50.346 --> 07:52.140
AND I STUDY

07:52.306 --> 07:55.017
GOOD. GOT EVERYTHING
YOU NEED AT THE HOUSE?

07:55.184 --> 07:56.435
I MEAN,
I COULD HELP IF--

07:56.602 --> 07:58.896
NO, THANKS. I MEAN,
WE'RE GETTING ALONG,

07:59.063 --> 08:00.314
BUT YOU KNOW PA.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.483
HE WOULDN'T TAKE
ANYTHING FROM ANYONE.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.610
HA! WELL, THAT'S BAILEY
FARRELL, ALL RIGHT.

08:04.777 --> 08:07.280
SALT OF THE EARTH,
BUT IRISH STUBBORN.

08:07.446 --> 08:10.533
ALL THE SAME,
YOU KNOW WHERE I AM
IF YOU NEED ME.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.702

I'M FULL-STARVED.

08:25.089 --> 08:26.257
ME, TOO,
MRS. INGALLS.

08:26.424 --> 08:27.967
WELL, WE CAN'T
HAVE THAT, CAN WE?

08:28.134 --> 08:29.260
IT JUST SO
HAPPENS THAT

08:29.427 --> 08:30.803
I BAKED A NICE APPLE
PIE FOR SUPPER,

08:30.970 --> 08:33.973
BUT I SUPPOSE WE CAN
SPARE SOME FOR TWO
STARVING VICTIMS.

08:34.140 --> 08:35.474
THANK YOU, MA.

08:37.685 --> 08:38.811
MY PIE!

08:38.978 --> 08:41.772
IT WAS COOLING RIGHT HERE,
AND NOW IT'S GONE.

08:41.939 --> 08:43.816
THE CREEPER
STRIKES AGAIN.

08:43.983 --> 08:45.067
DOGGONE IT, ANDY!

08:45.234 --> 08:46.485
IF WE DON'T CATCH
THAT CREEPER,

08:46.652 --> 08:48.613
HE'S GONNA TURN US
ALL INTO SKELETONS.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.740
Charles: HEY, MARY,
GONNA HAVE SOME FRESH
BUTTER, HUH?

08:50.907 --> 08:53.534
Laura: COME ON.
LET'S TELL PA
WHAT HAPPENED.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.454
Laura: PA!
WE'VE BEEN ROBBED.

08:56.621 --> 08:58.206
Charles: I DIDN'T
KNOW WE HAD ANYTHING
WORTH STEALING.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.832
Caroline: WELL, THAT'S
NOT A VERY NICE THING

08:59.999 --> 09:01.334
TO SAY ABOUT MY APPLE PIE.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.085
IF IT'S YOUR APPLE PIE,
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.795
THE THIEF SHOULD
BE HORSEWHIPPED.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.505
Laura: AND MY
LUNCH AGAIN, TOO.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.216
HE'S GOT
GOOD TASTE.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.843
GOT EVERYTHING YOU WANTED
ON THE LIST EXCEPT VINEGAR.
THEY WERE OUT.

09:11.010 --> 09:12.011
OH, THANK YOU.

09:12.178 --> 09:13.596
Laura: WE'RE GONNA
CATCH THAT CREEPER, PA.

09:13.763 --> 09:15.181
ME AND ANDREW
ARE FORMING
A DETECTIVE AGENCY.

09:15.348 --> 09:16.224
GARVEY
AND INGALLS.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.017
INGALLS AND GARVEY.
I'M OLDER.

09:18.184 --> 09:19.268
HA HA HA!

09:19.435 --> 09:20.436
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
WE'RE GONNA HIRE OUT

09:20.603 --> 09:21.771
AND MAKE BUSHELS
OF MONEY.

09:21.938 --> 09:24.023
I WANT TO BE
A DETECTIVE, TOO.

09:24.190 --> 09:26.901
IT MUST BE CATCHING.
I BETTER GO MAKE
ANOTHER PIE.

09:27.068 --> 09:28.152
ALL RIGHTY.

09:28.319 --> 09:30.321
MIND IF I ASK YOU TWO
MASTERMINDS A QUESTION?

09:30.488 --> 09:31.364
WHAT, PA?

09:31.530 --> 09:33.574
WELL, FORMING
THIS DETECTIVE AGENCY,

09:33.741 --> 09:36.869
WHAT DO YOU TWO
KNOW ABOUT DETECTING?

09:37.036 --> 09:38.871
I'VE READ EVERY
ONE OF HIS BOOKS--

09:39.038 --> 09:40.373
FREMONT
OF SCOTLAND YARD.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.500
I KNOW EVERY ONE
OF HIS CASES AND
HOW HE SOLVED THEM.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.377
AND I'VE BEEN
READING THEM, TOO.

09:44.543 --> 09:45.378
FREMONT, HUH?

09:45.544 --> 09:46.671
MUST BE
PRETTY GOOD.

09:46.837 --> 09:48.047
Andrew: THE BEST.

09:48.214 --> 09:50.216
YOU GOT TO
REMEMBER YOU'RE
NOT FREMONT.

09:50.383 --> 09:51.884
WHO'S GONNA
HIRE YOU?

09:52.051 --> 09:53.386
YEAH, A COUPLE OF KIDS.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.346
WHAT CASES
HAVE WE SOLVED?

09:55.513 --> 09:57.598
WELL, EVERYBODY'S
GOT TO START SOMEWHERE.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.891
LOOK AT ALLAN PINKERTON.

09:59.058 --> 10:00.226
HE WAS JUST
A PLAIN BARREL MAKER

10:00.393 --> 10:02.144
UNTIL HE SOLVED
THE COUNTERFEITING CASE.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.563
NOW HE'S GOT
THE PINKERTON
DETECTIVE AGENCY,

10:04.730 --> 10:06.274
AND HE'S MAKING
A FORTUNE.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.858
ALL WE HAVE TO DO

10:08.025 --> 10:09.735
IS CATCH THE CREEPER
OF WALNUT GROVE,

10:09.902 --> 10:12.280
AND EVERYONE WILL BE
WANTING TO HIRE US!

10:12.446 --> 10:13.531
THEY'LL BE LINING UP!

10:13.698 --> 10:15.116
WE'LL MAKE A FORTUNE.

10:15.283 --> 10:16.867
I GOT TO ADMIT, IT'D BE
NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY

10:17.034 --> 10:18.619
WITH MONEY IN THE FAMILY
FOR A CHANGE.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.162
GOOD LUCK.

10:22.832 --> 10:24.583
I WANT TO BE
A DETECTIVE!

10:24.750 --> 10:26.419
YOU CAN'T.
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.045
I WANT TO BE ONE.

10:28.212 --> 10:29.338
LET'S MAKE HER
A SPY.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.090
OK. YOU'RE A SPY.

10:31.257 --> 10:34.385
GOODY!
I'M A SPY, I'M A SPY!

10:35.803 --> 10:37.430
WHAT'S A SPY?

10:37.596 --> 10:40.266
YOU HIDE BEHIND THINGS
AND SPY ON PEOPLE.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.059
YOU SEE WHAT
THEY'RE DOING,

10:42.226 --> 10:43.602
BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW IT.

10:43.769 --> 10:44.937
WHEN DO I START?

10:45.104 --> 10:46.147
RIGHT NOW.

10:46.314 --> 10:47.481
OK!

10:47.648 --> 10:51.902
HA HA! NOW WE CAN
