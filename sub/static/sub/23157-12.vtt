00:00.098 --> 00:04.091
I just know if anyone
can find my father, you can.

00:08.606 --> 00:12.303
- It wasn't my fault.
- You will never drive that car again.

00:12.377 --> 00:15.005
Why do you keep a man
like that on your estate?

00:16.447 --> 00:18.642
You're the guy
who caused my accident!

00:19.784 --> 00:23.550
I would hate to have something
happen to him before our transaction.

00:23.621 --> 00:26.852
Floyd.!

00:28.159 --> 00:29.387
Floyd!

02:31.933 --> 02:34.731
Gentlemen, we... we hardly
know each other.

02:37.205 --> 02:39.196
Come.

02:44.445 --> 02:47.380
Mr. Mizamura,
this is Mr. Lewellen.

02:47.448 --> 02:50.315
Mr. Mizamura,
it's always a pleasure, sir,

02:50.385 --> 02:52.353
to meet those
whom I do business with.

02:58.826 --> 03:02.262
Mr. Mizamura would like to know
when is the earliest you can deliver.

03:02.330 --> 03:05.094
Saturday. That'll give me
one day for validation.

03:07.001 --> 03:10.061
Mmm.

03:10.138 --> 03:12.072
That will be satisfactory.

03:12.140 --> 03:15.166
Mr. Mizamura will be on a golfing tour
of the outer islands until then...

03:15.243 --> 03:18.440
and will contact you
to arrange delivery upon his return.

03:18.513 --> 03:22.506
- And I still get my forty cents on
the dollar? - The agreement was 20.

03:22.584 --> 03:25.348
I thought it was 30.

03:25.420 --> 03:28.287
- Thirty?
- That's a deal. You bet.

03:28.356 --> 03:31.655
I was wondering if you could
arrange for me to get,

03:31.726 --> 03:34.217
oh, $2,000 in advance?

03:51.346 --> 03:53.576
Mr. Mizamura says 1,000.

03:53.648 --> 03:57.641
Well, that's very generous of you.
Thank you, and I'll see you Saturday.

03:57.719 --> 04:00.711
Oh.

04:04.826 --> 04:06.987
I don't trust him.

04:07.061 --> 04:09.291
Keep an eye on him.

05:28.609 --> 05:31.305
You were just lucky, T.C.
just lucky.

05:31.379 --> 05:36.146
Three aces in a row. Hey, man,
did you see that drop shot? Boop.

05:36.217 --> 05:40.415
Drop shot? That was a luck shot. The
ball hit the net and fell into my court.

05:40.488 --> 05:43.252
I don't care what it did.
It was still the match.

05:43.324 --> 05:46.657
You know T.C., if I didn't have
to pick this client up at the airport,

05:46.728 --> 05:49.288
I'd take you back there right now
and whip your behind.

05:49.364 --> 05:52.561
You'll get your shot,
next time Higgins goes out of town.

05:52.633 --> 05:55.727
What makes you think we have to wait
for Higgins to go out of town?

05:55.803 --> 06:00.502
Because you never ever invite me to play
tennis unless Higgins is out of town.

06:00.575 --> 06:03.510
Look, I can invite anybody over
anytime I want.

06:03.578 --> 06:05.637
Higgins does not run my life.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.409
Then why do you still gotta sneak
the car off the estate?

06:08.483 --> 06:11.680
I don't have to sneak anything!

06:11.753 --> 06:14.916
We have a deal.
I get unlimited usage.

06:14.989 --> 06:18.720
- As long as you got gas money.
- I always have gas money, T.C.

06:18.793 --> 06:21.455
Yeah, except when
you're ridin' with me.

06:23.664 --> 06:28.363
Hey, man, what the hell are you doin'?
What am I doing? What's he doing?

06:48.990 --> 06:51.151
Oh, dear.

06:51.225 --> 06:54.285
Oh, this is terrible.

06:54.362 --> 06:57.854
I'm so sorry.
I tried to stop in time,

06:57.932 --> 07:00.924
but I... I have trouble
with my right leg...

07:01.002 --> 07:03.937
and I couldn't get it
to the brake fast enough.

07:04.005 --> 07:07.566
Arthritis, you know. Kind
of runs in the family. Ah.

07:07.642 --> 07:09.667
My sister Emily had it.

07:09.744 --> 07:13.475
It was on the left side,
and that isn't bad for driving.

07:13.548 --> 07:17.575
Well, I'm sure
it's very inconvenient for you.

07:17.652 --> 07:21.486
What an understanding young man you are.
Thank you.

07:21.556 --> 07:23.922
Look, I don't think we need
to involve the police in this.

07:23.991 --> 07:27.290
Why don't you just give me the name of your
insurance company, and I'll take care of the rest.

07:27.361 --> 07:30.091
Oh, my, I knew this might happen.

07:30.164 --> 07:32.325
What might happen?

07:32.400 --> 07:35.892
I knew the minute
I canceled my coverage,

07:35.970 --> 07:38.131
something would go wrong.

07:38.206 --> 07:41.300
You don't have any insurance?

07:42.777 --> 07:45.473
I had to give up something.

07:45.546 --> 07:48.208
It was either the insurance
payments or Stanley.

07:48.282 --> 07:50.341
He's my husband...

07:50.418 --> 07:55.185
in the rest home... where I'm going to
now, as soon as I pick up my food stamps.

07:55.256 --> 07:57.190
Stanley's in a rest home?

07:57.258 --> 08:00.284
I hope he remembers me today.

08:02.497 --> 08:06.593
Well, hey, look, let's...
let's just forget the whole thing.

08:06.667 --> 08:09.033
I mean, accidents do happen.

08:09.103 --> 08:11.799
What a wonderful person!

08:11.873 --> 08:16.037
Thank you. You know, I don't
think it looks so bad after all.

08:16.110 --> 08:19.409
You could probably fix it yourself.
Yeah, probably.

08:20.615 --> 08:22.708
It's such a beautiful car.

08:22.783 --> 08:26.310
Whoever owns it
must be very proud of it.

08:26.387 --> 08:28.355
Well, bye-bye.

08:34.895 --> 08:37.626
Oh, it's bad, Thomas.

08:37.698 --> 08:40.097
You're telling me.

08:40.167 --> 08:43.193
God. Well, at least Higgins
is out of town.

08:43.270 --> 08:46.968
I'm not talkin' about the car. I'm
talkin' about my neck! I got whiplash!

08:47.041 --> 08:51.808
No, you don't! You couldn't do that
with your neck if you had a whiplash.

08:51.879 --> 08:56.976
Well, if you don't mind, I would
like a second opinion from a doctor.

08:57.051 --> 09:01.010
And would you give me that woman's insurance
company, because I ain't gonna pay for this.

09:01.088 --> 09:03.022
I can't do that.

09:04.091 --> 09:06.719
What do you mean,
you can't do that?

09:06.794 --> 09:09.285
Stanley's in a rest home.
Her name's Stanley?

09:09.363 --> 09:12.924
No! Stanley's her husband.
And she doesn't have insurance.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.934
Thomas!

09:24.378 --> 09:27.575
Is Burnside there?
This is Floyd Lewellen.

09:29.150 --> 09:32.608
Oh, Burnside. I've been thinking
it over very carefully,

09:32.687 --> 09:35.485
and I've decided to meet up
with you Sunday night after all.

09:35.556 --> 09:37.922
Are you serious this time,
Lewellen?

09:37.992 --> 09:40.426
Now, look, I know I skipped out
on you once before,

09:40.494 --> 09:42.826
but, well, I was being shot at.

09:42.897 --> 09:46.298
Now you can't blame a man for acting
skittish when he's being shot at, can you?

09:46.367 --> 09:49.928
All right, Lewellen. Sunday.
Don't be late.

09:50.004 --> 09:54.668
What do you think he's doing?
Maybe he's calling the supplier.

10:03.284 --> 10:05.548
Pan Pacific Airlines.
May I help you?

10:05.620 --> 10:10.523
I'd like to, uh, confirm
a reservation for Saturday.

10:10.591 --> 10:13.025
Your name, please?
Floyd Lewellen.

10:13.094 --> 10:16.495
Yes, Mr. Lewellen, you're confirmed.
Thank you.

10:17.898 --> 10:21.766
I dropped T.C. at his office
screaming he was going to sue me.

10:21.836 --> 10:26.205
For all his size and strength, he sure could
get shook up over something minor like a kink.

10:26.273 --> 10:29.299
I was the one with the real pain.

10:29.377 --> 10:31.811
I had a $60,000 car
with a dented bumper.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.296
Pan Pacific Flight 95...

10:55.369 --> 10:58.338
now arriving from San Francisco
at Gate Seven.

11:09.650 --> 11:11.584
Miss Lewellen? Mr. Magnum?

11:11.652 --> 11:13.552
Yeah. Thomas Magnum?

11:13.621 --> 11:16.249
I'm sorry I'm late. I had a slight delay.
Oh, no, you're not late.

11:16.323 --> 11:18.655
I'm just so thankful
you could pick me up.

11:21.829 --> 11:23.922
Did you just get off another case
or something?

11:23.998 --> 11:27.559
Uh, no, not just this minute.
See, I had a little car trouble.

11:27.635 --> 11:31.833
I'm sorry. I don't usually meet my clients
in my tennis clothes, Miss Lewellen.

11:31.906 --> 11:34.704
Here, why don't you let me
carry that for you. Thank you.

11:34.775 --> 11:37.107
Please, call me Cindy.

11:37.178 --> 11:39.874
You know, I'm really confident
about this, Mr. Magnum.

11:39.947 --> 11:42.142
I'm sure that
you're gonna find my daddy.

11:42.216 --> 11:44.343
Tom. Why don't you call me Tom.

11:44.418 --> 11:46.477
And I hope you're right.
Oh, I know I'm right.

11:46.554 --> 11:49.318
All my friends in Kansas
think so too.

11:49.390 --> 11:52.951
You said you had some
correspondence from your father.

11:53.027 --> 11:57.293
Uh-huh. Mr. Doug Ival,
report to Customs, please.

11:57.364 --> 11:59.355
Here.

12:02.103 --> 12:06.062
This is it? A postcard?

12:07.141 --> 12:08.938
Isn't that enough?

12:09.009 --> 12:13.173
Well, it doesn't give me
much to go on.

12:13.247 --> 12:15.545
You said that all you needed
was some correspondence.

12:15.616 --> 12:20.053
But I thought you must have had a whole stack of
letters or something. I mean, after ten years.

12:22.022 --> 12:24.354
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:24.425 --> 12:28.088
That's the only thing I received
from my father since he left.

12:28.162 --> 12:31.689
And I thought it would be enough.
God, I...

12:31.766 --> 12:35.099
Hey, wait a minute.
Uh, don't get upset.

12:35.169 --> 12:38.195
I mean, this is helpful.
This is very helpful.

12:38.272 --> 12:40.604
I mean, this is a postcard
from Oahu, right?

12:40.674 --> 12:44.735
So that means he's on Oahu, right?

12:44.812 --> 12:47.610
Well, then, we'll find him
on Oahu, won't we?

12:50.951 --> 12:53.249
- Mr. Magnum.
- Tom.

12:53.320 --> 12:55.413
Tom.

12:55.489 --> 12:58.788
I just know if anyone can find
my father, you can.

12:58.859 --> 13:02.420
Well, I'm gonna give it
my best shot.

13:09.637 --> 13:11.730
Oh, here it is.

13:15.042 --> 13:19.638
Excuse me. Debbie Whitney, please
pick up the white courtesy phone.

13:19.713 --> 13:23.114
Debbie Whitney, please pick up
the white courtesy phone.

13:28.989 --> 13:31.822
I hope there's room
for my luggage.

13:31.892 --> 13:34.190
Hey, how'd you know
this was my car?

13:34.261 --> 13:36.821
What else would
a man like you drive?

14:02.723 --> 14:05.385
I know it's in here somewhere.

14:05.459 --> 14:08.895
I've been carrying it with me
ever since I received the postcard.

14:08.963 --> 14:11.022
Ah, here it is.

14:12.099 --> 14:15.364
That's a picture of my dad and me
on my 16th birthday ten years ago.

14:15.436 --> 14:18.701
Hmm. He even looks
a little familiar to me.

14:31.485 --> 14:33.749
Twenty-seven hundred dollars.!
For a bumper?

14:33.821 --> 14:35.880
Thomas, they have to
import these things.

14:35.956 --> 14:38.083
I could go to Italy myself
and get it cheaper.

14:38.158 --> 14:40.854
Well, is it yea or nay? I can't
keep Angelo waiting. Yea.

14:40.928 --> 14:42.862
Angelo, it's a go.
But I need it fast.

14:42.930 --> 14:45.763
But he needs it fast. Did you ever
know an Italian to do anything slow?

14:45.833 --> 14:48.324
Angelo, hey, thanks a lot.
Say hello to Sarducci.

14:48.402 --> 14:50.927
Yeah. Ciao.

14:51.005 --> 14:53.769
This place is so beautiful.

14:53.841 --> 14:58.778
Hawaii is even more gorgeous than the travel brochures
that I looked through before I came over here.

14:58.846 --> 15:01.371
- Cindy's from Kansas.
- Oh, yeah. No kidding?

15:01.448 --> 15:03.416
Hawaii is probably a little bit
different than Kansas, huh, Cindy?

15:03.484 --> 15:06.476
Mm-hmm. And the people
are so open and friendly.

15:06.553 --> 15:09.886
Well, I'll let you two
get down to business.

15:09.957 --> 15:13.757
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I offer you a drink?
Maybe an ice tea or a cold soda?

15:13.827 --> 15:15.886
How about a Shirley Temple?

15:15.963 --> 15:18.056
Do you have any bourbon?

15:18.132 --> 15:20.157
Bourbon? Yeah, sure.

15:20.234 --> 15:24.102
- Yes, I'd like that on the rocks, please.
- One bourbon on the rocks comin' up.

15:24.171 --> 15:27.004
- Thomas?
- Maybe just a Shirley Temple for me.

15:28.509 --> 15:30.739
I'll, uh, see you guys later.

15:37.017 --> 15:40.111
You think I'm kind of weird 'cause
I'm smiling all the time, don't you?

15:40.187 --> 15:43.486
No, I don't. I think it's terrific.
You're so happy.

15:43.557 --> 15:46.651
Well, I didn't always
feel this way.

15:46.727 --> 15:50.094
It's just been recently
since I heard from my father.

15:50.164 --> 15:54.692
I feel like I'm a new person since
I found it within me to forgive him.

15:54.768 --> 15:57.703
For what?

15:57.771 --> 16:00.296
For just picking up and leaving
Mom and me ten years ago.

16:02.209 --> 16:07.203
I mean, at first it was hard to understand
how he could do something like that,

16:07.281 --> 16:09.943
but then Dad's always
been a bit of a rogue.

16:11.919 --> 16:14.046
Mom bad-mouthed him
to me for years,

16:14.121 --> 16:18.581
and she probably was right
about a lot of things that she said,

16:18.659 --> 16:20.627
but he is my father,

16:20.694 --> 16:24.721
and I can't help but believe that
what he did, he did for a reason.

16:26.934 --> 16:30.734
Cindy, I know how important
this is to you,

16:30.804 --> 16:34.501
but I want you to understand that finding
your father isn't gonna be that easy.

16:34.575 --> 16:38.841
Oh, I understand, Tom.
But I just know we will.

16:41.515 --> 16:44.075
Let me take another look
at that postcard your father sent you.

16:48.922 --> 16:52.085
Time-Way Travel would like to welcome
all of you who are joining us...

16:52.159 --> 16:55.686
on our three-day Waikiki fling.

16:55.763 --> 17:00.860
In just a few minutes, I'll be telling you
everything you need to know about the tour.

17:00.934 --> 17:06.395
But first, why doesn't everybody help
himself to his complimentary cocktails.

17:06.473 --> 17:10.967
- That'll be 3.50.
- Didn't you hear the man?

17:11.045 --> 17:13.205
Supposed to get
a complimentary drink with the tour.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.249
Yes, sir. A mai tai, a chi-chi
or a blue Hawaii.

17:16.316 --> 17:20.082
I don't want no fruit cocktail.
I ordered a shot and a beer.

17:20.154 --> 17:23.281
Yes, sir, that's two drinks,
and they come to 3.50.

17:23.357 --> 17:25.790
Let me explain somethin' to you, son.

17:27.493 --> 17:29.860
See, where I come from,

17:29.930 --> 17:33.161
a shot and a beer is one drink.

17:33.233 --> 17:36.964
And a compliment is somethin'
you don't never want to take back.

17:37.037 --> 17:39.369
You understand what I'm sayin'?

17:39.440 --> 17:41.431
Good boy.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.544
Excuse me. Yes, may I help you?

17:52.619 --> 17:55.588
Yeah. I thought this fellow here
was supposed to be givin' this tour.

17:57.791 --> 18:00.157
Oh, that's an old brochure.

18:00.227 --> 18:03.094
He doesn't do the Waikiki fling.
That's no longer his tour.

18:03.163 --> 18:06.724
Well, I... I wonder if you could
tell me what tour he is givin'?

18:06.800 --> 18:11.237
See, he's an old friend of mine
and I'd kinda like to surprise him.

18:11.305 --> 18:14.570
No. I'm sorry. I don't know
which islands he does now.

18:14.641 --> 18:16.905
But why don't you check
with our travel office?

18:16.977 --> 18:18.968
Thank you.

18:23.350 --> 18:28.253
Mr. Lewellen used to work here,
but he's no longer with Time-Way Travel.

18:29.423 --> 18:33.291
Oh, that's too bad. I wanted him
to head up our branch office.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.887
Branch office?
Yes. What was your name again?

18:36.964 --> 18:38.989
Debbie. Oh, Debbie.

18:39.066 --> 18:42.832
Well, see, I'm with Sexxy Tours.
Don't let the name fool you.

18:42.903 --> 18:45.804
Our founder's name was Charles Sexxy,
that's with two "" X's."

18:45.873 --> 18:50.037
Of course, it doesn't hurt our business,
especially with the singles set in California.

18:50.110 --> 18:52.135
I'll bet.

18:52.212 --> 18:56.012
But, uh, I don't think you want Floyd
to head up your branch office.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.574
Why not?
His résumé was very impressive.

19:00.420 --> 19:02.718
Apparently, he wasn't bondable.

19:02.789 --> 19:05.417
Some kind of a problem
in his background check.

19:05.492 --> 19:09.326
Oh. But his résumé
was so impressive, Debbie.

19:09.396 --> 19:14.629
Perhaps there's been some mistake.
Do you know where I might reach him?

19:14.701 --> 19:19.536
Well, we forwarded his last paycheck
to his new employer, Oahu Greeters.

19:20.607 --> 19:24.043
Oahu Greeters? What's that?

19:24.111 --> 19:27.342
We'll meet your mother
at the airport with a lei,

19:27.414 --> 19:30.781
we'll have a fruit basket
awaiting for her at her hotel,

19:30.851 --> 19:33.911
and when she leaves,
we'll provide the champagne.

19:33.987 --> 19:36.615
- Now, how much you wanna spend?
- I don't wanna spend nothin'.

19:36.690 --> 19:38.624
I'm lookin' for a Floyd Lewellen.

19:40.761 --> 19:43.594
- Line forms to the rear.
- I heard he worked here.

19:43.664 --> 19:47.259
Used to. Just long enough
to run up an $85 tab.

19:47.334 --> 19:51.168
Then he phoned in sick
and never showed again.

19:51.238 --> 19:54.674
- Have you got an address on him?
- Some motel.

19:54.741 --> 19:57.767
But they said he checked out.
They said he stung them too.

19:57.844 --> 20:02.804
Hmm. Well, I owe him some money myself.
Sounds like he could use it.

20:04.618 --> 20:06.779
Tell you what.
Why don't I pay his bill here...

20:06.853 --> 20:11.290
That way I'll take care of two birds with one
stone. I don't have any problem with that.

20:11.358 --> 20:14.725
If you could just give me a little
better idea of where I might find him.

20:14.795 --> 20:20.131
The only thing I know about him is that
he worked a part-time job at some hotel.

20:21.435 --> 20:24.063
He worked for some
traveling luau thing...

20:24.137 --> 20:28.471
named, uh, John or Jack's,
something like that.

20:28.542 --> 20:31.511
Can I get you something?

20:31.578 --> 20:33.739
Is this where they hold Jack's Luau?

20:33.814 --> 20:36.044
Just on Tuesday, Friday
and Sundays.

20:36.116 --> 20:38.516
And the rest of the week
it's at the Royal Palm.

20:38.585 --> 20:41.452
Oh, I was looking for Floyd Lewellen.
Would I find him there?

20:41.521 --> 20:44.081
No, not anymore. jack cut him
loose a couple of weeks ago.

20:44.157 --> 20:47.490
He got fired?
Well, I'm not sure.

20:47.561 --> 20:50.530
I think he was skimming
a little off the top.

20:50.597 --> 20:54.033
He's embezzling? Ooh, that
makes it sound so serious.

20:54.101 --> 20:58.731
He was short on cash. So that's why I got
him introduced to the gift exchange.

20:58.805 --> 21:02.468
- The what?
- The gift exchange. It's a money game.

21:02.542 --> 21:05.670
You start by giving a gift
of a thousand dollars,

21:05.746 --> 21:07.947
and when it's your turn to receive,
you get over 50,000.

21:08.015 --> 21:10.643
And the best part of it
is the weekly meetings...

21:10.717 --> 21:13.618
where you get bonuses
for bringing in extra members.

21:13.687 --> 21:15.678
Sounds like a pyramid club.

21:15.756 --> 21:19.214
Oh, it's so much more.
It's a whole economic system.

21:19.293 --> 21:21.784
Plus, an alternative energy source.

21:23.063 --> 21:26.590
Hey, you should come
to our party this afternoon.

21:26.667 --> 21:30.763
I'll get a bonus, and you can see
firsthand how everyone plays.

21:32.339 --> 21:35.831
We don't have anything
like this in Kansas.

21:38.145 --> 21:40.909
Are you gonna play
the game, Tom?

21:40.981 --> 21:42.915
No, I don't think so.

21:42.983 --> 21:45.611
Why not?
I think it sounds like a lot of fun.

21:45.686 --> 21:50.680
I mean, a thousand dollars is a lot of
money, but if we went in "halvsies."

21:50.757 --> 21:53.021
"" Halvsies?" Uh, Cindy,

21:53.093 --> 21:56.256
I think there's a little more
involved here than just money.

21:56.330 --> 21:58.764
Besides, we're here to look
for your father, remember?

21:58.832 --> 22:00.959
Yeah, you're right.

22:01.034 --> 22:03.298
I just thought we'd get
into some of the action.

22:04.771 --> 22:07.035
Listen, everybody.
Could I have your attention?

22:07.107 --> 22:10.599
I want you all to see who Vicki
brought with her. This is Bull.

22:10.677 --> 22:13.373
Is he going to play?
Well, I hope so.

22:14.548 --> 22:16.778
I'm Louise.

22:16.850 --> 22:22.015
And I just wanna say that I'm really getting
off on you, Bull. You are fantastic!

22:22.089 --> 22:25.252
I wanna play with you.

22:27.961 --> 22:30.725
Are you sure
you don't wanna play?

22:30.797 --> 22:33.698
It all looks so exciting.
I'm sure.

22:33.767 --> 22:36.327
Let's go watch the ocean.

22:36.403 --> 22:38.394
Okay.

23:09.569 --> 23:11.799
Looks like he's just going
to a party.

23:11.872 --> 23:15.205
Good. He'll be in there for a while.
So now we can eat.

23:43.336 --> 23:46.203
I'm really surprised
you came, Tom.

23:46.273 --> 23:50.369
If I'd known you were here,
I would've had Jill introduce you too.

23:50.444 --> 23:54.073
I could've gotten a bonus.
Gee, I'm sorry.

23:54.147 --> 23:58.550
It was just kind of a last-minute thing. I had
a friend who wanted to see what it was like.

23:58.618 --> 24:01.052
Who's your friend?
Oh, she went to the bathroom.

24:01.121 --> 24:03.055
She?

24:03.123 --> 24:05.853
Vicki, I wanna talk to you.
Floyd!

24:05.926 --> 24:08.019
Floyd Lewellen?

24:08.094 --> 24:10.085
Floyd!

24:10.163 --> 24:12.097
Floyd!

24:13.166 --> 24:16.795
Floyd!

24:16.870 --> 24:19.566
Floyd?

24:21.341 --> 24:23.536
Floyd, wait! Don't run away!

24:24.544 --> 24:27.240
Somebody's chasing him
with a gun.

24:30.250 --> 24:32.343
Floyd!

24:44.898 --> 24:48.163
Well, I guess you don't
want me to play no more.

25:05.860 --> 25:08.781
I don't know who you are, mister,
but I want you outta here!

25:08.855 --> 25:11.688
Believe me,
I didn't plan to come along!

25:11.758 --> 25:15.387
Burnside put you onto me, didn't he?
Burnside? Was he the one shooting at you?

25:15.462 --> 25:19.228
Those Japanese were not shooting at me.
They were shooting at Bull!

25:19.299 --> 25:23.429
Bull, the big guy at the party?
Well, why is this Bull after you?

25:23.503 --> 25:26.472
- Who are you anyway?
- I'm a private investigator,

25:26.539 --> 25:28.564
and I was hired by your daughter
to find you.

25:28.641 --> 25:30.575
Oh, now, wait a minute.
That's a cheap shot.

25:30.643 --> 25:33.111
My daughter's in Kansas.
She was in Kansas.

25:33.179 --> 25:36.099
She's here now. You could have seen her
if you hadn't run outta that house.

25:36.149 --> 25:39.209
My daughter Cindy
was at that party?

25:39.285 --> 25:41.753
- My Cindy?
- Yes!

25:51.498 --> 25:55.127
You! You're the guy
who caused my accident!

26:04.410 --> 26:06.344
Lewellen!

26:09.449 --> 26:11.940
Lewellen!

26:16.990 --> 26:19.254
Lewellen disappeared
into the traffic so fast,

26:19.325 --> 26:21.816
for a moment, I wondered
if he'd been run over.

26:21.895 --> 26:24.420
No such luck.
So I was back to square one,

26:24.497 --> 26:27.625
and my only hope of getting to square
two was finding this guy Burnside...

26:27.700 --> 26:29.793
that Lewellen had mentioned.

26:29.869 --> 26:32.429
But first I had to rescue Cindy
from the party.

26:45.885 --> 26:49.116
And then by the time I came out of the
house, most of the shooting had stopped.

26:49.189 --> 26:52.386
But it was kind of exciting with the
people running around and everything.

26:57.463 --> 27:02.127
But did you actually see anything?
Um, no, I didn't.

27:02.202 --> 27:06.195
I mean, like I said, it started when I was
in the bathroom. See, I came with a friend...

27:08.241 --> 27:12.871
And, uh, I better go find him.
It was nice talking to you.

27:12.946 --> 27:14.971
Uh, miss, please?

27:15.048 --> 27:17.744
Where'd you go, Tom?
You missed all the action.

27:17.817 --> 27:20.684
No, unfortunately, I didn't.
Just get in the car, Cindy.

27:20.753 --> 27:23.813
We came in a taxi.
Uh, just get in the car.

27:30.930 --> 27:33.023
You mean you found my father
and he ran away?

27:33.099 --> 27:36.762
Well, he really didn't have much choice
considering all those people shooting at him.

27:36.836 --> 27:39.703
Well, who'd wanna shoot
at Daddy, besides Mother?

27:39.772 --> 27:44.209
He's such a wonderful person. Well,
that guy Bull didn't seem to think so.

27:44.277 --> 27:47.110
That guy at the party?
He was shooting at my father?

27:47.180 --> 27:49.341
And me.
I was in the car with your dad.

27:49.415 --> 27:51.940
And he ran away even after
you told him I was here?

27:52.018 --> 27:55.010
Oh, no, Cindy,
he was real glad to hear that.

27:55.088 --> 27:59.081
Then why didn't he wanna see me? He was
probably just running away from me.

27:59.158 --> 28:01.558
Cindy, he wasn't running
away from you.

28:01.628 --> 28:05.564
I worked so hard to save my money to
come over here just to find my daddy.

28:05.632 --> 28:09.966
And then when I finally do,
he doesn't wanna see me anymore.

28:10.036 --> 28:13.130
Oh, no.
It's all right. Don't cry.

28:20.914 --> 28:22.882
It's okay.

28:24.317 --> 28:28.310
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to break down like that.

28:28.388 --> 28:30.322
It's okay. I don't mind.

28:30.390 --> 28:33.223
It's kind of a nice contrast
to the smile you usually wear.

28:33.293 --> 28:37.787
Yeah, that's the smile
that I'm talkin' about.

29:19.055 --> 29:23.549
Well, I think, uh, maybe
you'd like a drink, to relax you.

29:23.626 --> 29:26.891
That sounds good. Higgins has
some wonderful bourbon in here.

29:28.565 --> 29:31.090
I thought scotch was your drink,
Magnum.

29:32.769 --> 29:36.398
Higgins, you're back.
What a mind this man has.

29:36.473 --> 29:40.102
Oh, you're Higgins.
Did you have a good time in England?

29:40.176 --> 29:42.610
Quite good, yes. Thank you.

29:44.614 --> 29:46.548
Where's the car?

29:46.616 --> 29:48.914
Oh, it's being tuned up.
Thank you.

29:48.985 --> 29:50.577
It just had a tune-up.

29:50.653 --> 29:53.383
I thought they were fixing the dent.
Uh, Cindy.

29:53.456 --> 29:55.321
Dent?

29:55.391 --> 29:57.985
- There's a dent in the car?
- Oh, yeah.

29:58.061 --> 30:01.326
Somebody plowed into it from behind.
It's not that bad, though.

30:01.397 --> 30:03.661
But it sure is expensive to fix.
Cindy.

30:03.733 --> 30:05.724
Twenty-seven hundred dollars
seemed like a lot to me... Cindy...

30:05.802 --> 30:08.430
Twenty-seven hundred dollars?

30:08.505 --> 30:10.496
Yeah, that's what I said.

30:10.573 --> 30:13.371
It's wasn't my fault!

30:13.443 --> 30:17.174
You continue to drive a car that you do not
own, do not rent and do not even wash.

30:17.247 --> 30:19.442
And while you were driving that car,

30:19.516 --> 30:22.917
it suffered $2,700
worth of damage.

30:22.986 --> 30:26.251
Had it been parked in the driveway of
Robin Masters's estate where it belonged,

30:26.322 --> 30:28.290
it would have suffered none.

30:28.358 --> 30:32.294
- It is your fault.
- I was hit from behind!

30:32.362 --> 30:34.722
Well, then at least the accident
will go on their insurance.

30:34.764 --> 30:38.200
Well...

30:38.268 --> 30:41.135
You were hit by
an uninsured motorist?

30:41.204 --> 30:44.037
Higgins, I'm sure Robin has all
that coverage on his insurance.

30:44.107 --> 30:46.598
The important thing
is to get the Ferrari fixed.

30:46.676 --> 30:48.837
Let me tell you something.
This Angelo is really good.

30:48.912 --> 30:52.848
We are not putting this accident on Robin
Masters's insurance. You will pay the damages.

30:54.217 --> 30:56.777
Higgins, that's twenty-seven
hundred dollars.

30:56.853 --> 31:00.983
You have a choice, Magnum. Either pay
the cost of the repairs yourself,

31:01.057 --> 31:03.685
or you will never drive
that car again!

31:12.402 --> 31:14.893
Why do you keep a man
like that on your estate?

31:52.742 --> 31:54.903
Hi, guy.

32:15.999 --> 32:18.490
The first note was from Cindy.

32:18.568 --> 32:22.470
She said Higgins was going to the club
and she'd asked if she could tag along.

32:22.538 --> 32:24.472
She hoped I didn't mind.

32:24.540 --> 32:28.067
And then she thanked me again for helping
her and told me I was wonderful.

32:30.079 --> 32:32.172
The second note was from Higgins.

32:32.248 --> 32:35.445
I really can't repeat what he said.
Let me put it this way.

32:35.518 --> 32:38.385
He didn't think I was wonderful.

32:49.666 --> 32:54.399
Haven't we met before? Please to join Mr.
Mizamura as his guest for lunch.

33:08.284 --> 33:12.380
You are acquainted with
a certain Floyd Lewellen.

33:12.455 --> 33:15.015
I have reason to believe
that his life is in danger,

33:15.091 --> 33:17.150
and I am concerned
for his safety.

33:17.226 --> 33:20.627
Oh, that's very touching.
You mind telling me why?

33:20.697 --> 33:24.155
Mr. Lewellen and I have
a business arrangement.

33:24.233 --> 33:27.066
I would hate to have
something happen to him...

33:27.136 --> 33:29.661
before our transaction is completed.

33:29.739 --> 33:32.435
What kind of business arrangement?

33:32.508 --> 33:34.874
That should not concern you.

33:34.944 --> 33:38.380
Suffice it to say,
that he has agreed to deliver to me...

33:38.448 --> 33:42.714
certain documents for resale,
and that time is of the essence.

33:42.785 --> 33:47.279
Oh. So that's why your boys
were shooting at me.

33:47.357 --> 33:49.222
They were not shooting at you,

33:49.292 --> 33:51.624
but at the man shooting
at Mr. Lewellen.

33:51.694 --> 33:55.562
- Oh, you're just looking out for him, huh?
- Precisely.

33:55.631 --> 33:59.795
- Well, then what do you want from me?
- You drove off with him.

33:59.869 --> 34:02.394
You have his car.

34:02.472 --> 34:04.872
Obviously, you know where he is.

34:10.380 --> 34:13.871
You may reach me at this number
if you have any problems.

34:17.754 --> 34:20.882
Just make sure he shows up.

34:20.956 --> 34:22.822
And if he doesn't?

34:24.460 --> 34:28.396
Mr. Magnum, I am a businessman.

34:28.464 --> 34:30.955
If he does, I will reward you.

34:32.268 --> 34:35.260
If he doesn't, they will.

34:44.547 --> 34:46.742
So I got back from 'Nam,
came here to Hawaii,

34:46.815 --> 34:50.216
became manager of the club, and I just didn't
have a desire to go back to the mainland.

34:50.219 --> 34:52.152
I don't blame you.
Can you check...

34:52.221 --> 34:54.815
Cindy?
Hi, Tom! Did you get my note?

34:54.891 --> 34:59.055
- Huh?
- Did I do something wrong?

34:59.128 --> 35:02.120
No, of course not.

35:02.198 --> 35:04.462
Well, you're looking at me so funny.

35:04.534 --> 35:06.764
Huh? No, uh, you look great.

35:06.836 --> 35:09.464
I mean, it's great that you...
Can you check this for me?

35:09.539 --> 35:11.530
Sure.

35:15.912 --> 35:17.903
Uh, I found it.

35:19.348 --> 35:23.045
Yoshio Mizamura, international
representative for Shimoda Transducers.

35:23.119 --> 35:27.055
Says here he's been a member of the club for five
years. I've never seen him around here before.

35:27.123 --> 35:29.751
I gathered he traveled a lot.

35:29.826 --> 35:31.817
This man is looking for my father too?

35:31.894 --> 35:35.125
They have a deal for some documents
that your father has.

35:35.198 --> 35:38.565
What kind of documents would
Lewellen have access to?

35:38.634 --> 35:43.037
I remember Daddy was always involved in very
intricate things. He's such a versatile man.

35:43.106 --> 35:45.666
Maybe something at work...
one of his jobs.

35:45.741 --> 35:49.177
- What about the tour outfit?
- No, there's nothing to lift.

35:49.245 --> 35:52.976
- Huh? - Well, I mean, there's
nothing that your father...

35:53.049 --> 35:55.017
would have had access
to except travel brochures.

35:55.084 --> 35:57.416
Oh, reminds me.

35:57.487 --> 36:00.012
I got that information
on that Burnside fellow for you.

36:00.089 --> 36:04.287
- Who's Burnside?
- He's a friend of your father's, I think.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.022
He was one of the men that was
shooting at him? No, he wasn't.

36:07.096 --> 36:09.656
Then I'm gonna go with you. No. No. No,
you're not. You just stay here, Cindy.

36:09.732 --> 36:12.326
I will take care of it.

36:12.401 --> 36:18.033
I'll find your father. I promise.
You stay here and get a tan.

36:22.478 --> 36:25.811
Rick had run down seven
Burnsides on the island.

36:25.882 --> 36:29.978
But I knew this had to be
the Burnside I was looking for.

36:30.052 --> 36:32.543
I'd already tried the other six.

36:50.506 --> 36:52.440
Clarence Burnside? Yeah.

36:52.508 --> 36:55.534
Does the name Floyd Lewellen
mean anything to you?

36:59.115 --> 37:02.016
Yeah, you bet your life
I'm tryin' to track down Lewellen.

37:02.084 --> 37:03.949
Why? Why?

37:04.020 --> 37:07.683
Well, that's not exactly
any of your business, is it?

37:07.757 --> 37:09.691
Okay. Thanks for the coffee.
Wait a minute.

37:09.759 --> 37:12.091
Relax, Magnum. Relax.

37:15.264 --> 37:19.530
- You have any idea where
he might be, huh? - Maybe.

37:22.171 --> 37:26.835
I work, uh, in the
witness relocation section.

37:26.909 --> 37:30.003
Floyd's a protected
government witness.

37:30.079 --> 37:33.479
He's been relocated here through the alias
program. And he's driving me out of my mind.

37:33.482 --> 37:37.043
- Why? What's he done?
- The old guy's a con man.

37:37.119 --> 37:41.283
He's always wheelin' and dealin', pullin' all kinds
of shenanigans. I'm assigned to protect him.

37:41.357 --> 37:44.518
You know what it's like to look after a
guy like that, always gettin' in trouble?

37:44.560 --> 37:47.552
- I'm afraid he's gonna blow his cover.
- I think he already has.

37:47.630 --> 37:52.363
What? Well, some guy named Bull
took some shots at him last night.

37:52.435 --> 37:54.960
- You know where he is?
- No. I lost him again.

37:56.906 --> 38:02.310
Look, I gotta find him really quick. He's
scheduled to testify at a trial on the 18th.

38:02.378 --> 38:05.745
- Are the police after him?
- No! No!

38:05.815 --> 38:08.079
Whatever you do, don't bring them
into it, because then I'll have...

38:08.150 --> 38:10.710
so much red tape I won't
be able to cut through it in a month.

38:10.786 --> 38:14.381
Lord knows how many shenanigans
and cons he's pulled by now.

38:14.457 --> 38:17.654
I'll never get him to court
on the mainland if they get him.

38:17.727 --> 38:19.718
I just got him out
of a counterfeit charge.

38:19.795 --> 38:22.423
And before that, stolen securities,
cashing penny stocks.

38:22.498 --> 38:25.592
The guy's a real wacko.
The tour office.

38:25.668 --> 38:28.831
- What?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

38:28.904 --> 38:31.873
Look, if I find him,
I'll give you a call.

38:31.941 --> 38:35.399
Magnum, wait a minute. Level with me.
You have an idea where he is?

38:35.478 --> 38:39.278
No, nothing really. I just got some
thoughts and I wanna check 'em.

38:39.348 --> 38:41.714
You'll call me when you check 'em out?
Yeah, I'll call you. I promise.

38:41.784 --> 38:43.479
You sure? I promise.

38:43.552 --> 38:45.816
All right. Thanks a lot.
You bet.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.879
Bye.

38:50.426 --> 38:53.327
Well, um, did you hear that?

38:53.396 --> 38:56.763
Sure did.
What are we gonna do now?

38:56.832 --> 39:00.461
Do now? We follow Magnum.

40:26.756 --> 40:28.485
Peek-a-boo.

40:30.192 --> 40:32.217
Daddy!

40:35.064 --> 40:37.464
Cindy. Cindy!

40:37.533 --> 40:40.730
Oh, Cindy! Cindy, it's you!

40:40.803 --> 40:44.330
Oh, Cindy! I didn't believe my eyes.
How are you?

40:44.407 --> 40:48.173
Oh, I didn't think
I'd ever find you again.

40:48.244 --> 40:50.735
I didn't think I'd ever find you either.

40:50.813 --> 40:53.304
How did you know
to look here for me?

40:53.382 --> 40:57.785
Well, I had a little chat with
your pals Mizamura and Burnside.

40:57.853 --> 40:59.878
What the hell did
you talk to Burnside for?

40:59.955 --> 41:04.983
Well, first I couldn't figure out what kind of
documents you'd have that Mizamura would want.

41:05.060 --> 41:09.121
But then after I talked to Burnside and
found out about the counterfeit charges...

41:09.198 --> 41:12.599
- Counterfeiting? - I figured out
what it was you'd have access to...

41:12.668 --> 41:15.228
that Mizamura was interested in...
airline tickets.

41:15.304 --> 41:20.105
You're validating airline tickets that you're
stealing from this office to sell to Mizamura.

41:20.176 --> 41:23.407
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm trying to tie up the loose ends, Floyd.

41:23.479 --> 41:25.413
You know, like those TV detectives.

41:25.481 --> 41:28.541
You're in trouble with the law,
aren't you, Daddy?

41:28.617 --> 41:31.245
Floyd? Is that why you ran
away from Mom and me?

41:31.320 --> 41:35.188
Floyd, don't you think it's about time
you told your daughter the truth?

41:35.257 --> 41:37.782
I wouldn't know where to begin.

41:37.860 --> 41:41.990
Well, I think you could begin by telling
her you're a relocated government witness.

41:43.999 --> 41:46.934
Is that the truth? Yes.

41:53.242 --> 41:55.176
You see.

41:55.244 --> 41:58.407
You see. I told Mom that whatever
you did, you did for a reason.!

41:58.481 --> 42:00.381
That wasn't the reason, Cindy.

42:00.449 --> 42:04.130
But if the government had to hide you for your
own protection... That part of it was true, yes.

42:04.186 --> 42:08.282
But I could've taken you and your mother
with me, whether I testified or not.

42:08.357 --> 42:11.884
But I didn't, because I knew
I'd end up walking' out on her...

42:11.961 --> 42:16.091
'cause things hadn't been very good
between us for a long time.

42:17.967 --> 42:21.630
You just left me behind.
Oh, no, no.

42:21.704 --> 42:23.638
If I'd have thought for a minute...

42:23.706 --> 42:27.642
that I could've provided as good a home
for you as your mother could,

42:27.710 --> 42:29.735
believe me,
I'd have taken you with me.

42:29.812 --> 42:32.144
But I never stopped missing you.

42:32.214 --> 42:34.409
And I never stopped loving you.

42:34.483 --> 42:37.281
And I never will, not even
when they throw me in the jail.

42:37.353 --> 42:42.188
Floyd, all you gotta do is put the tickets
back in the safe and Burnside will never know.

42:42.258 --> 42:46.251
Burnside.! Burnside is the reason
I had to pull this deal.!

42:46.328 --> 42:48.523
He promised me a new life.

42:48.597 --> 42:51.998
Hardly gave me enough to survive on,
much less a new life!

42:52.067 --> 42:55.901
Tell me something. If you're a relocated
witness, why didn't they change your name?

42:55.971 --> 42:59.463
Well, it's another one
of Burnside's brilliant ideas.

42:59.542 --> 43:01.662
I had an alias for a while,
but they almost caught me.

43:01.710 --> 43:04.679
So he thought they wouldn't look up
a relocated witness...

43:04.747 --> 43:07.079
who was using his own name.

43:07.149 --> 43:10.516
- Who'd you testify against?
- The Klan.

43:10.586 --> 43:14.078
Is that who you're testifying against
in this upcoming trial? What trial?

43:14.156 --> 43:17.614
Burnside said that there was a new trial
that you were supposed to testify at.

43:17.693 --> 43:20.025
I don't know anything about it.

43:21.730 --> 43:24.096
I think we'd better
get out of here fast.

43:27.369 --> 43:30.202
Well, what's wrong, Tom?

43:30.272 --> 43:32.763
We got a squealer on our hands,
that's what's wrong.

43:34.209 --> 43:37.178
And nobody squeals on the brotherhood
and gets away with it.

43:37.246 --> 43:40.374
Ain't that right, Burnside? You're right.
Always right, Bull.

43:40.449 --> 43:43.543
All right, Burnside,
how much you gettin' out of this?

43:43.619 --> 43:48.886
Probably not any more than what Floyd got for
spying on the boys back home. It's not much.

43:48.958 --> 43:52.291
Every Monday night
there you was, Floyd,

43:52.361 --> 43:54.352
just like a true brother.

43:54.430 --> 43:57.160
Some of them boys
even missed you when you left.

43:57.232 --> 43:59.359
Well, I think it's time we took
you back home where you belong.

43:59.435 --> 44:03.235
Can't you leave these two out of this?
Take me, but leave my daughter.

44:03.305 --> 44:07.867
- That can be arranged, Floyd. - You're lying.
You're gonna kill all of us, aren't you?

44:07.943 --> 44:12.903
Let's say we all leave here and go talk about
this somewhere else. Let's go. Move it.

44:22.424 --> 44:26.918
Mr. Magnum, I trust you were bringing Mr.
Lewellen to my meeting.

44:26.996 --> 44:28.827
Who's them fellas?

44:28.897 --> 44:31.525
That is precisely
what I was about to ask you.

44:31.600 --> 44:35.434
Well, they have your tickets.
What tickets?

44:35.504 --> 44:37.233
"What tickets?'."

44:37.306 --> 44:40.275
Come on, Burnside. Don't be coy
with Ironman Mizamura.

45:07.936 --> 45:10.200
Magnum!

45:10.272 --> 45:12.263
All right.! Hold it.!

45:12.341 --> 45:15.936
- Right there! - Hands up
against the wall.! Spread 'em.

45:16.011 --> 45:19.139
- Daddy.
- Hello, Officers.

45:20.449 --> 45:22.610
You're probably wondering
what's going on here.

45:34.463 --> 45:38.092
I can't believe how nice the judge was to
all of us after you explained it to him.

45:38.167 --> 45:41.603
Well, you can't beat the truth.
Well, it wasn't all quite the truth.

45:41.670 --> 45:45.970
You did get just a little creative
concerning my participation in the matter.

45:46.041 --> 45:48.168
Oh, not really.
I just convinced the judge...

45:48.243 --> 45:52.475
that your desperate situation
as an unprotected relocated witness...

45:52.548 --> 45:55.016
forced you into an illegal
deal with Mizamura. Ah.

45:55.084 --> 45:57.518
Besides, I think he was
a lot more interested...

45:57.586 --> 46:00.282
in Bull and Burnside
than being hard on you.

46:00.355 --> 46:03.620
Let's face it. It's pretty hard for anyone
to turn his back on a story...

46:03.692 --> 46:05.785
about a father-and-daughter reunion.

46:08.030 --> 46:12.364
Thank you for bringing a very
important man back into my life, Tom.

46:27.416 --> 46:30.283
There you go. It's as good as new.
Angelo did a hell of a job on her.

46:30.352 --> 46:33.253
Yeah, it looks great.

46:33.322 --> 46:36.155
Well, Higgins,
what do you think?

46:37.292 --> 46:39.351
On the surface it appears
adequate enough.

46:39.428 --> 46:41.328
Adequate? It's perfect.
What's that?

46:41.396 --> 46:43.364
The bill.
Twenty-five hundred bucks.

46:43.432 --> 46:45.764
I got a couple hundred knocked off
'cause Angelo and I are buddies.

46:45.834 --> 46:48.325
Great.

46:48.403 --> 46:52.066
I assume that bill has to be paid
upon delivery of the car. Of course.

46:52.141 --> 46:55.269
Rick, could I wait a day or two?

46:55.344 --> 46:57.676
Thomas, you said you could pay.

46:57.746 --> 47:01.079
Never mind. This is one bill I'll
be quite happy to pay. What?

47:01.150 --> 47:06.315
I promised Higgins that if I couldn't
pay the bill, I wouldn't drive the Ferrari.

47:07.990 --> 47:10.424
I'll pay that bill
if you please, Higgins.

47:13.729 --> 47:16.630
Well, I do owe Magnum
for finding my father,

47:16.698 --> 47:19.963
and my father was responsible
for his accident.

47:20.035 --> 47:23.095
Which one was that?

47:23.172 --> 47:25.140
Hey, where'd you get
all that money?

47:25.199 --> 47:28.498
At the gift exchange,
when I went to the powder room.

47:28.577 --> 47:30.807
There was one heck
of a crap game in there.

47:30.879 --> 47:33.109
Gift exchange?
