WEBVTT

00:12.260 --> 00:13.785
Two-nine to dispatch,
ten-double-zero.

00:13.962 --> 00:15.361
Ten-double-zero,
requesting backup.

00:15.530 --> 00:17.055
Crossover D.

00:22.070 --> 00:23.629
I didn't see anything, I swear.

00:23.805 --> 00:25.671
I never saw your faces.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.200
Take off, and nothing will happen.

00:28.543 --> 00:30.443
- Come on, let's go.
- Please!

00:30.612 --> 00:31.977
I'm out of here!

01:36.511 --> 01:38.070
Kind of early for you, Deeks.

01:38.246 --> 01:40.874
Well, you can't be too careful.
Mercury's in retrograde.

01:41.049 --> 01:42.141
Meaning?

01:42.317 --> 01:45.184
A few times a year, the planet Mercury
appears to be traveling backwards

01:45.353 --> 01:47.845
through the zodiac.
It causes all of our plans to go awry.

01:48.022 --> 01:49.421
Seriously?

01:49.591 --> 01:50.990
I think you're in retrograde.

01:52.860 --> 01:55.192
- Morning.
- You're late.

01:55.363 --> 01:57.263
- Mercury.
- We were supposed to shoot hoops.

01:57.432 --> 01:59.594
- Sorry, I had a flat tire.
- Mercury.

01:59.767 --> 02:01.861
- You couldn't call?
- My cell phone battery died.

02:02.036 --> 02:03.561
Ahem! Mercury.

02:03.738 --> 02:04.933
Actually, it's lithium ion.

02:05.106 --> 02:07.336
Apparently, we have a problem
with Mercury over here.

02:07.508 --> 02:10.341
What, the messenger of the gods?
The, uh, guy with the winged sandals?

02:10.511 --> 02:12.445
Never liked him. Always in a hurry.

02:12.614 --> 02:13.911
Mock, mock, mock.

02:14.082 --> 02:16.676
But when Mercury is in retrograde
and traveling backwards,

02:16.851 --> 02:18.683
everything goes catawampus,
so stay flexible

02:18.853 --> 02:20.343
and allow for extra travel time.

02:20.521 --> 02:21.613
Morning.

02:21.789 --> 02:23.450
- Hey, Kensi.
- Yeah?

02:23.625 --> 02:25.457
What happens
when Mercury is in retrograde?

02:25.860 --> 02:28.591
- Deeks gets retro-annoying.
- Wow.

02:28.763 --> 02:30.788
Oh, come on.
Problems happen all the time,

02:30.965 --> 02:33.605
and three times a year, we have
to blame it on Mercury? Ridiculous.

02:33.768 --> 02:36.294
- Sounds like an urban myth.
- It's more like a superstition.

02:36.571 --> 02:38.938
Don't do it. Don't taunt Mercury.

02:39.107 --> 02:42.187
Or what, the guy in the chariot's gonna
stop pulling the sun around the Earth?

02:45.847 --> 02:49.715
Can't you hear the whistle blowing?

02:50.885 --> 02:52.148
I wish I couldn't.

02:54.689 --> 02:57.158
Oh, hold on, I should call my mom.

02:57.325 --> 02:58.349
Why? What's going on?

02:58.526 --> 03:01.325
I stepped on a crack this morning,
so she's probably in the OR by now.

03:01.496 --> 03:03.658
- God.
- Ha-ha-ha.

03:08.703 --> 03:12.503
Brian Cheng, security guard
for the Fillmore and Western Railway.

03:13.741 --> 03:15.368
Ow, that had to hurt.

03:15.543 --> 03:16.840
Anything on the bad guys?

03:17.011 --> 03:19.673
Wearing masks,
usually avoiding security cameras.

03:19.847 --> 03:21.474
These guys knew
what they were doing.

03:21.649 --> 03:23.743
He's not gonna do that, is he?

03:24.118 --> 03:25.142
Afraid so.

03:28.790 --> 03:29.848
Oh, man.

03:30.024 --> 03:32.891
- Two minutes earlier...
- Cheng caught them trespassing.

03:33.061 --> 03:34.688
Taking photos and measurements.

03:34.862 --> 03:37.422
- Casing the joint.
- Dead men tell no tales.

03:37.598 --> 03:39.362
- Sheriff's Department's on this?
- Oh, yeah,

03:39.534 --> 03:42.026
but Cheng's walkie was open
during the attack.

03:42.203 --> 03:44.103
And as he was thrown
under the train...

03:48.343 --> 03:52.337
There are rumors of al Qaeda
targeting rail lines in Europe.

03:52.513 --> 03:53.639
Train terrorism?

03:53.815 --> 03:58.013
A soft target with the potential
for mass casualties.

03:58.486 --> 04:02.184
We need to be certain
that this does not come to pass.

04:02.457 --> 04:03.856
Check all fundamentalist chatter.

04:04.759 --> 04:06.955
Sam? Rail yard or security guard?

04:07.128 --> 04:10.655
- Uh, trains, I have an affinity for trains.
- Rail yard.

04:10.832 --> 04:12.732
This may be personal.
You look into the guard.

04:12.900 --> 04:13.958
Got it.

04:14.702 --> 04:15.965
Careful out there.

04:16.137 --> 04:18.161
Mercury is in retrograde.

04:19.540 --> 04:22.373
See? Hetty knows about...

04:22.543 --> 04:23.704
Oh, you're messing. Damn it.

04:35.022 --> 04:36.353
Hey.

04:38.126 --> 04:39.560
Copy that.

04:39.727 --> 04:41.092
Now, hold on...

04:41.462 --> 04:42.930
Morning.

04:43.097 --> 04:45.862
- Agent Callen.
- Agent Hanna, NCIS.

04:46.033 --> 04:47.762
Jeremy Pernell,
Railway Public Relations.

04:47.935 --> 04:50.029
Did the deceased
have a military connection?

04:52.006 --> 04:53.098
That's why we're here.

04:53.408 --> 04:55.240
Detective Garcia's in charge.

04:55.410 --> 04:57.276
You had a supervisor on duty
last night?

04:57.445 --> 04:59.277
He's home sleeping.

04:59.447 --> 05:00.505
Does he have a name?

05:01.082 --> 05:03.574
Well, I'd have to clear that
with management.

05:03.751 --> 05:05.583
This is a federal
criminal investigation.

05:05.753 --> 05:07.433
It'd be in your best interest
to cooperate.

05:07.588 --> 05:10.468
Absolutely, it's just, this has potential
to blow up into some bad press,

05:10.625 --> 05:13.754
and the FRA is coming down
from Sacramento, so...

05:13.928 --> 05:16.056
- The FRA?
- Federal Railroad Administration,

05:16.230 --> 05:18.528
our regulatory body.
First, we have to follow protocol,

05:18.699 --> 05:20.690
go through their channels
for their investigation,

05:20.868 --> 05:22.508
then Monday, tomorrow,
maybe the next day,

05:22.570 --> 05:24.330
you guys can sit down
and do your interviews.

05:24.472 --> 05:26.338
With our legal counsel present,
of course.

05:26.507 --> 05:29.306
Jeremy, are you trying
to obstruct justice?

05:29.477 --> 05:31.309
- Isn't that a felony?
- Up to 20 years.

05:31.479 --> 05:34.073
No, no, no. I am just doing my job.

05:34.615 --> 05:37.949
We'll have a little walk around the yard,
if that's all right with you.

05:38.119 --> 05:39.314
Be my guest.

05:39.487 --> 05:41.649
Whatever you guys need.

05:43.624 --> 05:47.083
He's either a big knucklehead,
or they've got something to hide.

05:47.261 --> 05:50.390
Either way, it sounds like
the FRA holds the keys to the castle.

05:50.565 --> 05:52.033
Let's put Kensi and Deeks on it.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.191
There were two of them.

05:54.569 --> 05:56.401
The first guy ran off that way.

05:57.605 --> 06:00.700
- Could've hopped the fence.
- That's what I'm thinking.

06:03.744 --> 06:05.769
Kind of nice to ride the rails, huh?

06:05.947 --> 06:08.279
Heh.
I don't share your hobo aesthetic.

06:08.449 --> 06:09.769
Talking about working on a train.

06:09.917 --> 06:12.852
Bringing people what they need,
being connected to history.

06:13.020 --> 06:16.046
- The rolling stone gathers no moss.
- That's right, you gotta keep moving.

06:16.224 --> 06:18.192
Otherwise, you'll have moss
growing all over you.

06:18.359 --> 06:19.793
That's not what the proverb means.

06:19.961 --> 06:21.087
It's exactly what it means.

06:21.262 --> 06:23.629
- No, it isn't. Moss is good.
- Moss is a disease.

06:23.798 --> 06:27.257
When you keep moving, you're barren.
You sleep on couches.

06:27.435 --> 06:30.871
When you're sturdy and still,
you put down roots.

06:31.038 --> 06:32.301
Moss has no roots.

06:32.473 --> 06:35.033
You peel it away
like a rotten banana.

06:35.209 --> 06:37.405
- I think your brain's a rotten banana.
- Mm-hm.

06:37.578 --> 06:40.172
- What is it?
- It's something with a dial.

06:41.549 --> 06:42.983
"Rome"?

06:43.951 --> 06:45.942
It's a long way from Italy.

06:46.621 --> 06:48.851
The instrument you found
is a trainman's gauge.

06:49.023 --> 06:51.287
It's used to measure pressure
in the air brake system.

06:51.626 --> 06:53.355
- What about Rome?
- I'm sending you

06:53.528 --> 06:54.996
a photo of Mitchell Rome.

06:55.162 --> 06:56.630
He's a recently-fired brakeman

06:56.797 --> 06:58.231
with Fillmore and Western.

06:58.499 --> 06:59.660
Why was he let go?

06:59.834 --> 07:02.030
He was about to be promoted
to engineer.

07:02.203 --> 07:04.163
Lost his job after testing positive
for marijuana,

07:04.305 --> 07:05.585
causing a collision in the yard.

07:06.007 --> 07:09.637
No one was hurt, damage was minor,
but it cost him his career.

07:09.810 --> 07:12.211
Might leave you with bitter feelings
toward your employer.

07:12.380 --> 07:13.643
Any extremist connections?

07:14.582 --> 07:17.711
Not him, but at the same
address is one Gil Bellamy,

07:18.119 --> 07:20.315
unemployed demolitions expert.

07:20.488 --> 07:23.321
Bellamy?
That's not your typical Arabic name.

07:23.858 --> 07:26.850
He's been a commenter
on several bomb-building websites,

07:27.028 --> 07:30.089
including one
called Jihadist Raiders Front.

07:30.598 --> 07:33.533
His knowledge of munitions
and Rome's knowledge of trains...

07:34.135 --> 07:35.796
This could end badly.

07:35.970 --> 07:37.802
Rome's on the second floor, 210.

07:37.972 --> 07:39.599
What? Something from ops?

07:39.774 --> 07:41.765
- My horoscope.
- You have a horoscope app?

07:41.943 --> 07:43.604
You wouldn't understand,
you're a Leo.

07:43.778 --> 07:45.405
That's right, lion, king of the jungle.

07:45.580 --> 07:48.447
Full of fire and aggression,
has to be right, even when she isn't.

07:48.616 --> 07:50.311
Actually, especially when she isn't.

07:50.484 --> 07:52.851
- And what does that make you?
- I'm a Capricorn.

07:53.020 --> 07:55.079
What is that,
the unicorn's inbred cousin?

07:55.256 --> 07:56.280
The ram.

07:57.725 --> 07:59.090
- Really?
- You're a goat?

07:59.260 --> 08:01.854
No, that's a completely
different animal. I'm the ram.

08:02.029 --> 08:04.327
I see, so scruffy, annoying bleat.

08:04.498 --> 08:08.799
Uh, stable, steady, loyal,
connected with the earth.

08:08.970 --> 08:11.064
Also, Leos drive Capricorns crazy.

08:11.238 --> 08:13.263
Yes, well, apparently, vice versa.

08:13.441 --> 08:15.432
- Slow down.
- You slow down, goat boy.

08:15.610 --> 08:16.941
No, no, no, 210.

08:17.545 --> 08:20.879
Hey, uh, sir? Hey, did you sign
for a package earlier?

08:21.482 --> 08:23.644
No. No! Federal agents!

08:23.818 --> 08:24.944
Federal agents!

08:37.664 --> 08:38.791
What's the rush?

08:38.966 --> 08:41.094
I thought you were the guys
that lived up there.

08:41.268 --> 08:43.566
What part of "federal agents”
did you not understand?

08:43.837 --> 08:45.431
- Hey, I only hear so good.
- Yeah?

08:45.606 --> 08:46.971
What do you need this for?

08:47.141 --> 08:48.939
A little Smith & Wesson revolver?

08:49.110 --> 08:50.271
What's up, old-school?

08:50.544 --> 08:53.241
I got a concealed weapons
carry permit in my wallet.

08:53.414 --> 08:55.007
Name's Anthony Trager.

08:55.182 --> 08:57.150
Private investigator.

08:57.585 --> 08:59.145
Telling the truth. Guy's a private eye.

08:59.286 --> 09:00.617
Ugh. A little help?

09:00.788 --> 09:04.588
Gumshoe, shamus, bird-dog.

09:04.759 --> 09:07.660
- What's wrong with this guy?
- He's in retrograde.

09:07.828 --> 09:09.762
Pls aren't supposed
to break into apartments.

09:09.930 --> 09:11.523
I knocked, the door was open.

09:11.699 --> 09:13.292
Retired L.A.P.D.?
You a cop? I'm a cop.

09:13.467 --> 09:15.299
Lawman, blue knight, hot fuzz.

09:15.736 --> 09:17.465
What is he, like, Rain Man
or something?

09:17.638 --> 09:19.106
I wish. At least he could count.

09:20.841 --> 09:22.832
So, what are you guys?
FBI? Homeland Security?

09:23.010 --> 09:24.478
NCIS.

09:25.012 --> 09:27.003
I guess we're both interested
in Mitchell Rome.

09:27.181 --> 09:28.842
Mm-hm. How's that, Dragnet?

09:29.016 --> 09:31.075
I was hired
by Fillmore and Western.

09:31.252 --> 09:33.448
He's been babbling
about dragging them into court

09:33.621 --> 09:35.248
for wrongful termination
of employment.

09:35.423 --> 09:37.517
I was looking for any skeletons
in his closet

09:37.692 --> 09:39.217
that might torpedo his case.

09:39.593 --> 09:41.459
Easiest gig I ever had.

09:41.629 --> 09:43.393
I mean, the guy's a real pothead.

09:43.564 --> 09:45.225
Stoner, dope fiend, smoke monkey.

09:48.569 --> 09:51.834
You know what I'm talking about.
Midnight toker. See you later.

09:52.907 --> 09:54.636
What the...?

10:10.825 --> 10:15.524
Okay, so... manuals, routes,
schematics.

10:15.730 --> 10:17.824
He is either
a really dedicated employee...

10:17.998 --> 10:19.830
Or a crazy and obsessive killer.

10:21.869 --> 10:23.701
Oh, man, is that what I think it is?

10:23.871 --> 10:25.270
What?

10:27.675 --> 10:29.006
Oh, my God, it is.

10:29.376 --> 10:33.006
It's an Airfix HO-scale
262 Prairie Tank.

10:33.614 --> 10:34.706
Excuse me?

10:34.982 --> 10:36.780
They don't even make these
anymore.

10:36.951 --> 10:40.182
And you know this because...

10:40.354 --> 10:42.584
Because I asked Santa for it
every single year,

10:42.757 --> 10:44.885
- and all I got was stupid Thomas.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:45.192 --> 10:47.251
Thomas is kind,
Thomas is dependable,

10:47.428 --> 10:49.089
Thomas is not stupid.

10:49.263 --> 10:50.424
Thomas has a face, all right?

10:50.598 --> 10:52.930
Trains shouldn't have a face,
and they shouldn't talk.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.068
We should all be so lucky.

10:57.037 --> 10:59.938
Um, you wouldn't happen to have

11:00.107 --> 11:03.168
the bomb squad on speed dial,
would you?

11:03.344 --> 11:04.812
What?

11:06.147 --> 11:09.481
Looks like we got
several bricks of plastic explosives,

11:09.650 --> 11:12.347
assorted blasting caps and timers.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.088
Highlighted rail maps

11:14.255 --> 11:16.280
through Pasadena,
Long Beach and downtown L.A.

11:17.191 --> 11:20.217
I'm gonna call it in.
These guys are getting ready to strike.

11:20.394 --> 11:24.422
I think I can, I think I can. Kaboom.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.934
Homeland Security's
been briefed and all freight

11:36.109 --> 11:38.476
and passenger security personnel
are on high alert.

11:38.645 --> 11:42.172
And absolutely nothing suspicious
on Cheng, the dead security guard.

11:42.348 --> 11:43.679
And what about Gil Bellamy?

11:43.850 --> 11:46.148
Rome took him in as a roommate
after he got fired,

11:46.319 --> 11:47.377
probably to help pay rent.

11:47.554 --> 11:49.714
But I'm still digging
through his electronic footprint.

11:49.956 --> 11:51.617
You sure this is the right hospital?

11:52.025 --> 11:54.357
Rome's mother was off duty at 8.
Followed by two hours

11:54.527 --> 11:55.653
of administrative meetings.

11:57.363 --> 11:58.956
Here we go.

12:01.100 --> 12:04.695
Jillian Rome? Federal agents.
Can we ask you a couple questions?

12:04.871 --> 12:07.533
I worked a night shift,
and I got a train to catch.

12:07.874 --> 12:10.172
- A train?
- Yeah, I commute from Diamond Bar.

12:10.343 --> 12:12.703
Get a nap both ways
and don't have to deal with the traffic.

12:12.846 --> 12:15.679
If this is about a patient, maybe
you can contact the appropriate...

12:15.849 --> 12:19.285
We'd like to ask you about your son.
You seen him lately?

12:20.019 --> 12:21.578
No. Um...

12:21.754 --> 12:24.917
I... Before he lost his job, I used
to talk to him every day on the phone,

12:25.091 --> 12:26.889
but now I'm lucky if I get a text.

12:27.193 --> 12:29.491
He's a suspect in a crime
at Fillmore and Western.

12:29.863 --> 12:31.456
Mitch is not a criminal.

12:31.931 --> 12:33.023
Do you know his roommate?

12:33.666 --> 12:34.690
What roommate?

12:37.537 --> 12:39.938
Look, my son is a straight arrow.

12:40.106 --> 12:42.973
I worked nights so I could be with him
every day after school.

12:43.142 --> 12:44.507
He knows right from wrong.

12:44.677 --> 12:47.078
According to his former employer,
he had a marijuana problem.

12:47.247 --> 12:48.772
No, no,
that whole thing was a mistake.

12:48.948 --> 12:50.382
I mean, he doesn't even drink.

12:50.550 --> 12:53.417
Mitch has loved trains
since he was in diapers.

12:53.753 --> 12:56.552
He used to beg me
to ride in to work on the train.

12:56.723 --> 12:59.090
It was his dream
to become an engineer.

12:59.859 --> 13:03.591
There's absolutely no way
that he would throw that all away.

13:03.997 --> 13:05.556
There isn't.

13:06.833 --> 13:09.894
If your son is innocent,
he may need protection.

13:10.069 --> 13:11.730
We need your help.

13:11.905 --> 13:15.102
We'd like your permission to access
your cell phone in case he calls.

13:16.676 --> 13:17.700
Okay.

13:17.877 --> 13:21.040
- If you see him, let us know.
- Will.

13:21.748 --> 13:23.238
Thank you.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.554
That's a good mom.

13:28.721 --> 13:29.950
Sounds like a good kid.

13:30.123 --> 13:31.352
Yeah.

13:31.524 --> 13:33.049
They said the same thing about you.

13:39.999 --> 13:41.626
I see the FRA has arrived.

13:41.801 --> 13:43.565
Yes, we have. Karen Bibb.

13:43.736 --> 13:45.898
Yolanda Campbell,
operations manager. Nice to meet you.

13:46.239 --> 13:47.570
Matthew Dunkler.

13:49.809 --> 13:52.369
- Matthew doesn't like to shake hands.
- Germs.

13:52.946 --> 13:55.381
I wasn't expecting you
until this afternoon.

13:55.548 --> 13:57.348
- Made good time.
- Lack of freeway congestion

13:57.483 --> 13:59.683
translated into an average velocity
of 72 miles an hour.

14:00.353 --> 14:01.377
That's great.

14:02.188 --> 14:03.212
Right this way.

14:03.389 --> 14:06.051
Files are necessary for all personnel
on duty during the incident.

14:06.225 --> 14:08.216
Training qualifications,
hours of service, uh,

14:08.394 --> 14:09.520
compliance training,

14:09.696 --> 14:11.425
drug and alcohol screening,
medical exams.

14:11.597 --> 14:13.725
It's all there.
Do you want to inspect the tracks?

14:13.900 --> 14:15.459
Uh, yes, but after the paperwork.

14:15.635 --> 14:16.995
Uh, interviews should be scheduled

14:17.136 --> 14:20.162
for the engineer, the conductor,
the yard master, security dispatcher,

14:20.340 --> 14:23.674
and once disengaged,
the event recorder should be queried.

14:23.843 --> 14:26.244
- And that can all be arranged.
- Ahem.

14:26.746 --> 14:29.147
- Matthew takes his job very seriously.
- I see.

14:29.983 --> 14:31.781
Well, make yourselves at home.

14:31.951 --> 14:34.181
My office is right down the hall
if you need anything,

14:34.354 --> 14:36.254
and, oh, for lunch, there's a couple...

14:36.422 --> 14:38.356
Ahem! Not necessary.

14:38.524 --> 14:39.582
Alrighty then.

14:39.759 --> 14:40.988
I'll let you get to work.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.184
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

14:43.096 --> 14:44.325
Yeah.

14:45.965 --> 14:47.160
What the hell?

14:47.333 --> 14:49.392
What? I told you
about my undercover character.

14:49.569 --> 14:51.249
Yeah, you told me
he was a by-the-book guy.

14:51.404 --> 14:53.685
- Not a weird and creepy guy.
- Hey, it worked, didn't it?

14:53.840 --> 14:55.137
She's leaving us alone.

14:55.308 --> 14:56.867
- Stop. Come here for a second.
- Ooh.

14:57.043 --> 14:58.807
First of all, the FRA is here.

14:59.112 --> 15:01.206
No, they're not expected
until this afternoon.

15:01.381 --> 15:02.780
Yeah? They just walked in.

15:02.949 --> 15:05.919
I have specific instructions
to shred everything in these files.

15:06.085 --> 15:08.349
- What are you doing?
- Ahem.

15:08.521 --> 15:09.784
You should see this.

15:09.956 --> 15:11.651
If they wanna check out the cabin.

15:11.824 --> 15:14.486
They won't, trust me. They got
more than enough to think about.

15:14.660 --> 15:16.788
I've been shredding on the railroad.

15:16.963 --> 15:19.193
- Lock it up now.
- A locked file.

15:19.365 --> 15:21.390
- Fascinating.
- The disk has everything.

15:22.101 --> 15:24.331
- Contraband in Rome's apartment.
- That's Trager.

15:24.504 --> 15:26.734
Uh, and photos
with the ex-con roommate.

15:26.906 --> 15:29.807
The guy's got a rap sheet
longer than a Texas mile. Heh.

15:29.976 --> 15:31.000
Pick up the pace.

15:31.177 --> 15:32.542
With criminal charges, you know...

15:32.712 --> 15:34.976
There is a stairwell
around the corner.

15:35.148 --> 15:37.776
Yeah, nobody's gonna touch
that kid's case with a 10-foot pole.

15:37.950 --> 15:40.817
So if you need anything else,
keep in touch.

15:42.221 --> 15:43.985
You know where to find me.

15:44.323 --> 15:46.003
Right around here to the left.
To the left.

15:46.559 --> 15:47.720
To the left, to the left.

15:50.196 --> 15:51.220
Ladies room. Really?

15:51.397 --> 15:53.277
They were on our tail
in case you didn't notice.

15:53.566 --> 15:55.125
Seventy-five cents for a tampon?

15:55.301 --> 15:57.141
Used to be a quarter
when I was in high school.

15:57.303 --> 15:58.429
He's gone.

15:58.604 --> 16:01.232
We'll just wait a few more minutes
and...

16:02.208 --> 16:03.505
Oh, crap.

16:03.676 --> 16:05.371
You're a handsome devil.
What's your name?

16:05.545 --> 16:08.242
Aah! Oh. Aah!

16:08.414 --> 16:10.746
Yeah,
the twins have a birthday party

16:10.917 --> 16:13.011
and soccer on Saturday,
so why don't you come over...

16:13.186 --> 16:15.245
Most ladies buy me
a couple of drinks first.

16:15.421 --> 16:16.547
Okay, sounds good, Mom.

16:16.722 --> 16:19.214
Yeah, love you too. Bye-bye.

16:20.093 --> 16:21.618
Too many feet.

16:27.266 --> 16:28.461
Molly, is that you?

16:29.802 --> 16:32.601
No, it's Karen from the FRA.

16:32.772 --> 16:35.742
- Love your boots.
- Thank you.

16:35.908 --> 16:38.536
So how long have you been working
with your partner?

16:38.711 --> 16:40.975
Um, oh, I...

16:41.347 --> 16:43.042
A couple years.

16:43.649 --> 16:45.083
Well, you seem so normal,

16:45.251 --> 16:47.447
- but he's seems so...
- Different?

16:47.620 --> 16:50.749
Honey, they ought
to be giving you hazard pay.

16:50.923 --> 16:53.858
You have no idea. Ha-ha-ha.

17:01.868 --> 17:03.927
Ivy League motel.

17:04.604 --> 17:06.834
So Bellamy's been here before?

17:07.006 --> 17:08.098
Credit card shows

17:08.273 --> 17:11.800
charges for Harvard House Motel
twice in the last 10 months.

17:12.944 --> 17:15.003
- Got it.
- And the stays coincide

17:15.181 --> 17:17.843
with restraining orders
from two ex-girlfriends

17:18.017 --> 17:19.848
after incidents of domestic violence.

17:20.019 --> 17:21.417
Sounds like a heck of a guy.

17:21.587 --> 17:23.146
- Yeah.
- Hey, be careful over there.

17:23.321 --> 17:24.811
We know. Armed and dangerous.

17:24.991 --> 17:29.451
Uh, no, the motel ranks number two
in L.A. on bedbugscorecard.com.

17:29.629 --> 17:31.927
So I'd consider washing your clothes

17:32.098 --> 17:34.123
on a fairly hot setting
after you leave.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.790
Extra 20 minutes in the dryer.

17:39.138 --> 17:41.436
- Have you seen this guy?
- "Gil Bellamy."

17:41.741 --> 17:43.937
He checked in three days ago
as Frank Babcock.

17:44.110 --> 17:45.168
With a fake ID.

17:45.344 --> 17:47.244
Expired credit card last time.

17:47.413 --> 17:48.972
I made him pay cash up front.

17:49.348 --> 17:52.147
- What room?
- Twenty-one. Need a key?

17:52.318 --> 17:54.878
Federal budget cuts.
Rather not kick down the door.

17:56.322 --> 17:57.483
Thank you.

18:02.228 --> 18:04.959
Mr. Babcock, the plumbers are here.

18:05.131 --> 18:06.997
Your shower's leaking
through the floor.

18:07.166 --> 18:09.533
You mind if we take a look around?

18:22.315 --> 18:23.646
Wire!

18:35.361 --> 18:36.522
You all right?

18:50.642 --> 18:52.201
Okay, thanks.

18:52.377 --> 18:54.368
Forensics at the motel found C-4.

18:54.546 --> 18:57.106
Well, that's no surprise.
He's a construction demolition man.

18:57.282 --> 18:58.482
We got a BOLO out for Bellamy.

18:58.650 --> 19:01.813
And Jillian Rome
has been texting with her son.

19:02.287 --> 19:03.948
"I'm okay, Mom, don't believe it.

19:04.122 --> 19:05.715
I'm doing the right thing."

19:05.890 --> 19:08.416
If blowing up two federal agents
is doing the right thing.

19:08.593 --> 19:10.391
That was Bellamy's work.

19:10.562 --> 19:12.587
How could Rome
be doing the right thing?

19:12.764 --> 19:15.096
Suppose he's got a gun to his head.

19:15.266 --> 19:16.461
Rome's cooperating.

19:16.634 --> 19:18.398
Bellamy's forcing him
to do his dirty work.

19:18.570 --> 19:21.540
Message originated
from an industrial area in Pacoima.

19:21.706 --> 19:24.505
Run Kaleidoscope facial rec and
check security cameras in the area.

19:24.676 --> 19:25.802
Got it.

19:32.550 --> 19:34.746
It was a very simple request
to pull down your pants.

19:34.919 --> 19:36.683
I don't like my trousers
to touch the floor.

19:36.855 --> 19:39.017
I prefer to pull them down
to my knees.

19:39.190 --> 19:41.318
Well, you could've done that,
shown some wrinkles.

19:41.493 --> 19:43.484
- Where do I have wrinkles?
- On your pant legs.

19:43.661 --> 19:45.741
More convincing when she
was checking out your shoes.

19:45.897 --> 19:47.592
Now she's super suspicious.

19:48.066 --> 19:49.506
Can we just think
about the shredder?

19:49.667 --> 19:51.965
Don't worry your pretty little head
because I have a plan.

19:52.136 --> 19:53.900
- Those words always scare me.
- Ahem.

19:54.072 --> 19:55.665
Ah. Apple?

19:56.174 --> 19:58.108
Yes, actually.

20:01.112 --> 20:05.174
- This is frozen.
- Mm-hm. And it's from the dry ice.

20:05.350 --> 20:09.116
See, regular ice turns to water
and gives you a soggy sandwich.

20:09.287 --> 20:12.120
And what is worse
than a soggy sandwich? Ha!

20:12.290 --> 20:14.850
"Having to listen to you." Heh.

20:15.026 --> 20:17.017
I didn't say it,
but I certainly thought it.

20:17.195 --> 20:19.960
That anger management class
was money well-spent.

20:24.035 --> 20:25.298
Or not.

20:27.672 --> 20:30.164
Get ready for a big bang.

20:31.075 --> 20:32.338
You sure about this?

20:32.844 --> 20:34.710
Positive.

20:35.547 --> 20:38.107
It's taking way too long.
I think Mercury's messing with you.

20:38.283 --> 20:40.149
Wait for it.

20:43.388 --> 20:45.720
- What was that?
- Showtime.

20:50.328 --> 20:53.093
- What the hell was that?
- Something blew up.

20:53.264 --> 20:56.325
- Everybody out. Let's go. Come on.
- Let's go!

21:07.178 --> 21:08.873
Incident reports.

21:14.552 --> 21:16.213
Confidential employee files.

21:20.692 --> 21:21.921
You ready, Kens?

21:23.528 --> 21:24.927
Ready.

21:29.567 --> 21:32.867
- Incoming.
- We need to leave the building now.

21:33.037 --> 21:36.302
- Not safe, definitely not safe.
- Matthew is prone to panic attacks.

21:36.474 --> 21:38.274
The fire department is on the way.
We're good.

21:38.443 --> 21:40.163
Oh, it's not good.
It's definitely not good.

21:40.311 --> 21:42.245
Oh, my lips are numb.
I can't feel my fingers.

21:42.413 --> 21:44.653
- I think I'm having chest pains.
- Breathe into the bag.

21:44.816 --> 21:46.750
- Okay.
- Breathe into the bag.

21:47.251 --> 21:50.744
- I'm sorry for all the chaos.
- Okay, let's go, come on.

21:52.290 --> 21:53.485
Is it getting dark in here?

21:53.658 --> 21:56.559
- Oh, I feel like it's getting dark in here.
- Matthew...

21:56.728 --> 21:58.992
I smell toast. Do you smell
toast? Why do I smell toast?

21:59.163 --> 22:01.291
- Am I having a stroke?
- There's no toast.

22:04.502 --> 22:06.231
Gil Bellamy and Mitchell Rome,

22:06.404 --> 22:09.305
arguing outside a futon warehouse
two hours ago.

22:09.474 --> 22:11.465
Can't decide on a king or a queen.

22:11.909 --> 22:14.173
One block from the burn phone text.

22:15.013 --> 22:16.344
Trouble in paradise.

22:16.514 --> 22:18.594
Looks like the partnership's
not working out so well.

22:18.750 --> 22:21.082
They couldn't agree on a plan
or someone screwed up.

22:21.252 --> 22:23.050
Or Rome just found out
about the rebar

22:23.221 --> 22:24.450
and bombing part of the plan.

22:26.391 --> 22:27.951
Did you get anything
off the hard drive?

22:28.092 --> 22:30.151
They've expunged all e-mails
to and from Rome.

22:30.328 --> 22:31.352
Even off the server.

22:31.529 --> 22:33.657
- What about the files?
- Rendering now.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.261
There was a lot of shredding
going on.

22:37.435 --> 22:38.664
It's a letter from Rome.

22:38.836 --> 22:40.770
"As I have repeatedly
told my supervisors,

22:40.938 --> 22:42.618
I have serious concerns
about the transport

22:42.774 --> 22:44.936
of hazardous materials
through HTUAs"?

22:45.109 --> 22:46.577
High Threat Urban Areas.

22:46.744 --> 22:49.645
"Materials including
chlorine gas, anhydrous ammonia

22:49.814 --> 22:51.373
and medical nuclear waste

22:51.549 --> 22:53.229
have been passing
through residential areas

22:53.384 --> 22:56.046
in violation of federal standards.”

22:56.220 --> 22:57.779
Why do that? Why take the risk?

22:57.955 --> 23:00.788
Shortest path from point A to point B
is the cheapest.

23:00.958 --> 23:03.689
Complying with indirect routes
could mean millions in lost revenue.

23:03.861 --> 23:06.922
So Rome was a whistle-blower.
They wanted to shut him up.

23:07.098 --> 23:10.227
They could have rigged his crash.
Tampered with his drug test.

23:10.401 --> 23:12.563
So Rome partnered with Bellamy
for revenge.

23:12.737 --> 23:14.017
But Bellamy's taking it too far.

23:15.807 --> 23:16.927
Got Jillian Rome calling in.

23:17.208 --> 23:19.336
- Put her on speakerphone.
- Yep.

23:20.411 --> 23:21.572
Agent Hanna here.

23:21.879 --> 23:25.474
Uh, hi, it's Jillian Rome. You, uh...
You told me to call.

23:25.650 --> 23:26.708
Have you seen your son?

23:26.884 --> 23:30.821
Not yet. But, um, a friend of his
stopped by the house.

23:30.988 --> 23:33.252
- Somebody you know?
- No.

23:33.524 --> 23:34.719
What did he look like?

23:34.892 --> 23:37.190
White guy, uh, maybe 30.

23:37.462 --> 23:39.123
He told me that Mitch was okay.

23:39.297 --> 23:41.493
And, um, he dropped off a box
of his stuff.

23:43.668 --> 23:45.830
You think
Bellamy would harm the mom?

23:46.003 --> 23:47.198
How big is the box?

23:47.772 --> 23:49.035
Like for files?

23:49.407 --> 23:51.068
- Should I open it?
- No.

23:51.409 --> 23:52.774
Get as far away as you can.

23:52.944 --> 23:55.038
We're on our way.
Call the bomb squad, evacuate.

23:55.213 --> 23:57.944
And stay on that shredder,
we need a smoking gun.

24:13.765 --> 24:15.130
Yeah.

24:15.299 --> 24:17.028
Detective is across the street...

24:17.201 --> 24:18.896
You guys came a long way for nothing.

24:19.170 --> 24:20.535
Looked like the real thing.

24:20.705 --> 24:22.265
Turns out, it's nothing but play putty.

24:22.707 --> 24:24.141
It's orange like RDX.

24:24.408 --> 24:25.898
Wired to an alarm clock?

24:26.077 --> 24:27.943
Like something Wile E. Coyote
used to build.

24:28.279 --> 24:30.714
Someone's got
a sick sense of humor.

24:33.417 --> 24:35.909
- Who would do this?
- And why?

24:37.655 --> 24:39.589
You recognize this man?

24:40.124 --> 24:41.421
He brought me the package.

24:46.964 --> 24:49.433
Okay. It's been verified.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.897
Calling it in.

24:53.070 --> 24:54.094
Go ahead, Eric.

24:54.372 --> 24:55.601
Are you with Mrs. Rome?

24:55.940 --> 24:57.237
We are.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.240
You might want to step away.

24:59.911 --> 25:01.310
- G.
- Excuse me.

25:01.746 --> 25:03.180
Uh, okay.

25:05.483 --> 25:06.507
Go ahead, Eric.

25:06.684 --> 25:08.948
A freight train's been hijacked
in Kern Junction.

25:09.654 --> 25:11.144
It's Bakersfield to the north.

25:11.322 --> 25:13.347
An engine and four tanks
of chlorine gas

25:13.524 --> 25:15.424
are heading for Los Angeles
right now.

25:15.893 --> 25:17.418
Bellamy must've knew
we were onto him.

25:17.595 --> 25:19.654
This fake bomb was a diversion
to keep us away.

25:19.831 --> 25:21.458
If those tankers explode or derail...

25:21.632 --> 25:23.430
At least a hundred thousand deaths.

25:23.868 --> 25:26.303
I'm sending you a screen grab
from surveillance video.

25:26.637 --> 25:28.105
You can make out the engineer.

25:31.175 --> 25:32.336
Mitchell Rome.

25:32.610 --> 25:34.510
Identity has been confirmed.

25:34.846 --> 25:36.280
You still think he's a good kid?

25:48.358 --> 25:49.382
Where are we?

25:49.559 --> 25:50.720
Approaching Mojave.

25:50.894 --> 25:53.124
Traffic's been cleared.
Homeland's searching the tracks.

25:53.296 --> 25:54.457
Any contact with Rome?

25:54.631 --> 25:56.224
Not answering his radio or cell.

25:56.399 --> 25:58.561
All right, what are our options?

25:58.869 --> 26:00.803
- Sniper?
- Could cause a crash.

26:00.971 --> 26:03.030
- A barrier?
- A barrier's gonna cause a derailment.

26:03.206 --> 26:04.731
We'll have the release
of toxic fumes.

26:04.908 --> 26:06.188
Do we need to evacuate the city?

26:06.343 --> 26:09.369
If you want mass casualties
due to panic.

26:09.546 --> 26:10.707
Could drop in by helicopter.

26:10.881 --> 26:12.747
An engine in front,
match his speed, slow it.

26:12.916 --> 26:16.546
The clock is ticking.
He'll be here in less than an hour.

26:16.820 --> 26:18.219
I can get to Hobart Yard,

26:18.388 --> 26:20.686
- head north on the high rail.
- Go.

26:20.857 --> 26:23.485
Eric, video conference the boatshed.
Where are Kensi and Deeks?

26:23.660 --> 26:26.493
Following up a facial recognition hit
on Bellamy.

26:29.399 --> 26:33.029
Boarding out front.
Have your ticket in hand for the driver.

26:33.203 --> 26:34.500
Thank you.

26:34.671 --> 26:36.196
Gambler's special to Vegas.

26:38.041 --> 26:40.373
- A lot of bystanders.
- That's Bellamy.

26:40.543 --> 26:43.240
Watch and learn.
Clean and surgical.

26:43.413 --> 26:45.814
- Cover my back.
- Got it.

26:47.884 --> 26:50.444
Anyone got change for
a buck? Anybody got change? You?

26:50.620 --> 26:52.940
Hey, you got change for a buck?
I need change for a dollar.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.649
- Got change for a dollar?
- Yeah, yeah.

26:54.824 --> 26:56.622
Some change for the meter.

26:57.427 --> 26:58.467
Federal agent. Don't move.

27:01.631 --> 27:02.962
- Got a gun.
- Hey!

27:05.035 --> 27:08.130
This would be a lot easier if you
would've just listened the first time.

27:08.305 --> 27:09.665
No, no, ma'am. That's okay, ma'am.

27:09.806 --> 27:11.205
- Aah!
- Oh!

27:11.374 --> 27:15.140
Ma'am, that's okay. You don't have to.
Wow, that seemed excessive.

27:15.312 --> 27:16.404
Thanks for looking out.

27:16.579 --> 27:18.741
I think your new partner
has your back.

27:19.382 --> 27:20.941
Punk ass!

27:23.486 --> 27:25.318
Thank you for your... For your help.

27:27.324 --> 27:28.951
Have fun in Vegas.

27:33.630 --> 27:37.157
Ten thousand dollars in cash
and a one-way bus ticket to Vegas.

27:37.334 --> 27:40.031
So, what's your game, huh?
Poker? Blackjack?

27:40.203 --> 27:42.399
No, I take you
as more as a keno guy.

27:42.572 --> 27:43.596
I want a lawyer.

27:43.773 --> 27:45.813
Gave up your right
when you blew up your motel room.

27:45.976 --> 27:47.239
What are you talking about?

27:47.410 --> 27:49.922
It's called the Patriot Act.
You almost killed two federal agents.

27:49.946 --> 27:52.176
I did an express checkout
at 7 a.m. this morning.

27:52.349 --> 27:53.817
Someone is setting me up.

27:54.084 --> 27:56.451
Do you have witnesses? Video?

27:56.619 --> 27:59.259
We do have a video of you
killing a security guard at a train yard.

27:59.422 --> 28:02.016
You're crazy.
I've never been near a train yard.

28:02.425 --> 28:03.688
But your roommate has.

28:04.427 --> 28:06.225
What were you two arguing about
in Pacoima?

28:08.064 --> 28:09.930
The fool wants to raise my rent.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.980
Rome is at the control of a toxic train
heading for downtown Los Angeles.

28:13.136 --> 28:14.763
Phew. That doesn't surprise me.

28:15.105 --> 28:18.097
- He went crazy after they fired him.
- Uh-huh. What's his plan?

28:19.142 --> 28:20.974
Why don't you ask him?

28:21.778 --> 28:23.803
Callen, we got a fix on Rome.

28:23.980 --> 28:25.971
His phone's with him,
but the power's been off.

28:26.149 --> 28:30.143
Until now. Enabling video chat.

28:39.796 --> 28:40.820
Mitchell Rome.

28:41.664 --> 28:45.396
My name is Special Agent G. Callen.
I need you to stop that train.

28:45.568 --> 28:46.660
Mitch, don't turn that off.

28:46.836 --> 28:48.395
I've got nothing to say.

28:48.571 --> 28:49.970
How about to your mom?

28:50.140 --> 28:51.733
Look, I... I got her right here
with me.

28:55.545 --> 28:58.879
- Mom?
- Mitch?

28:59.916 --> 29:03.648
Look, I... No one was supposed to die
last night. That wasn't part of the plan.

29:03.820 --> 29:05.345
I didn't mean to do anything wrong.

29:06.089 --> 29:08.854
Then stop the train, please.

29:09.025 --> 29:13.223
No, no, I got fired for telling the truth.
I'm trying to protect the public.

29:13.496 --> 29:16.336
Mitch, we know that and we're gonna
help you get your message out, okay?

29:16.499 --> 29:18.490
Now, just let's not do
anything stupid here.

29:18.868 --> 29:20.097
Won't.

29:20.270 --> 29:22.329
A lot of people could get hurt.

29:22.505 --> 29:24.200
No, I'm helping a lot of people.

29:24.374 --> 29:27.071
When I'm done here, they'll have
to re-route the hazmat runs.

29:27.610 --> 29:29.442
Mitch, are you working
with Gil Bellamy?

29:29.612 --> 29:31.546
No, this has nothing to do
with Bellamy.

29:31.714 --> 29:33.705
Mitch, you've made your point.

29:33.883 --> 29:35.942
Let's not take a chance
with something going wrong.

29:36.119 --> 29:39.180
Nothing's going wrong.
I'm taking this train to Union Station,

29:39.355 --> 29:40.845
and then I'll stop.

29:41.024 --> 29:42.924
Everyone's got to know the truth.

29:52.001 --> 29:54.368
Sam's sweeping the tracks
with ATF.

30:01.744 --> 30:03.439
I don't see anything out there
but weeds.

30:03.613 --> 30:05.945
It's a back branch line,
hardly ever used.

30:06.116 --> 30:08.016
Sam, do you know
what you're looking for?

30:08.184 --> 30:09.948
I will when I see it.

30:15.158 --> 30:17.149
Just got word
from the occupational lab.

30:17.327 --> 30:19.056
They thawed out Rome's drug test.

30:19.229 --> 30:21.994
DNA is not a match. It's not his urine.
He was framed.

30:22.165 --> 30:24.827
I told you, my son doesn't do drugs.

30:25.001 --> 30:27.493
More shredded documents
from Fillmore and Western.

30:29.072 --> 30:30.597
Falsified manifests.

30:31.141 --> 30:33.101
They were profiting by sending
hazardous materials

30:33.243 --> 30:34.267
into populated zones.

30:34.444 --> 30:36.572
My son is telling the truth.

30:36.746 --> 30:38.271
Unlike his roommate.

30:38.615 --> 30:40.515
Mitch Rome says
you two are working together.

30:40.683 --> 30:42.481
- Then he's a liar.
- What did you tell him?

30:42.652 --> 30:45.678
- To stop being such a wuss.
- So you told him to steal the train.

30:45.855 --> 30:47.289
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

30:47.457 --> 30:49.619
He says all he wants
is for his message to be heard.

30:49.792 --> 30:52.193
Heh. Oh, it'll be heard, all right.

30:52.362 --> 30:54.296
All the way to Long Beach.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.091
Update from Sam in Valencia.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.768
- Camera's on, guys.
- We've got the image.

31:09.746 --> 31:12.113
Okay, I've got an IED on the tracks.

31:12.282 --> 31:15.047
It has three parallel triggers
including a pressure plate.

31:15.218 --> 31:16.515
Can you render it safe?

31:16.686 --> 31:18.814
Not at the trigger.
It's got a mercury switch.

31:18.988 --> 31:21.116
A trembler.
Any movement will set it off.

31:22.325 --> 31:23.986
How big of a charge we talking?

31:24.160 --> 31:27.460
I couldn't tell you. It's wireless.

31:27.630 --> 31:29.792
Explosives are somewhere
under the tracks.

31:31.100 --> 31:32.363
Mitch, listen to me.

31:32.535 --> 31:34.970
Bellamy has placed a bomb
on the tracks in Valencia.

31:35.905 --> 31:37.168
Why would he do that?

31:37.440 --> 31:39.465
Because he's a sociopath.
Now, listen to me.

31:39.642 --> 31:42.805
Mitch, there's 250,000 people
in that area.

31:42.979 --> 31:46.540
If you don't stop, you could wipe out
the entire Santa Clarita Valley.

31:49.018 --> 31:52.386
- You just want me to stop.
- Mitch, I saw it for myself.

31:52.555 --> 31:54.819
You gotta trust us, Mitch.
You've made your point, okay?

31:54.991 --> 31:57.824
Now, stop this
before it turns into a disaster.

32:00.697 --> 32:03.723
Mitch, please.

32:07.770 --> 32:09.932
I'm slowing down.

32:13.843 --> 32:15.504
Eric, Sam, he's stopping.

32:19.115 --> 32:21.777
Um, it doesn't look like he's stopping.
In fact, he's accelerating.

32:23.519 --> 32:25.078
Mitch? Mitch, talk to me.

32:25.255 --> 32:26.689
You said you were slowing down.

32:26.856 --> 32:28.551
I'm trying.

32:28.725 --> 32:30.955
I got no air pressure.
I don't have any brakes.

32:32.362 --> 32:34.091
Bellamy sabotaged the lines.

32:37.233 --> 32:39.759
I'm going 60 miles an hour.
I can't stop.

32:39.936 --> 32:41.062
Oh, my God.

32:58.653 --> 33:00.917
- What about emergency brakes?
- No such thing.

33:04.593 --> 33:07.858
Well, maybe I can uncouple the engine
and leave the tanks behind.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.326
Give ita try.

33:46.234 --> 33:48.635
No, no, we're moving too fast.
The coupler's jammed.

33:50.338 --> 33:53.239
Well, maybe I can reverse the polarity
of the engine's motors.

33:53.408 --> 33:54.637
The bomb is three miles ahead.

33:54.809 --> 33:58.143
Uh, no, no, it's too dangerous.
There's no way I'm gonna stop in time.

33:58.313 --> 34:00.748
- Do we have any other option?
- Uh, I guess not.

34:14.596 --> 34:16.360
Ugh, I can't.
I'm braking from the head.

34:16.531 --> 34:18.571
The tank cars are bunching up.
They're gonna derail.

34:22.871 --> 34:24.998
Uh, I need at least five miles here.

34:25.172 --> 34:26.663
You don't have five miles.

34:26.841 --> 34:28.400
Okay, then get the bomb
off the track.

34:33.581 --> 34:35.914
Damn it. Nothing.

34:36.618 --> 34:38.746
- You should put on the suit.
- What's the point?

34:39.154 --> 34:42.248
If we survive the blast,
the toxic fumes will still melt our lungs.

34:43.824 --> 34:44.849
Sam?

34:45.025 --> 34:48.257
They turned over dirt for 50 yards.
The initiator could be buried anywhere.

34:48.429 --> 34:49.556
How long is it gonna take?

34:49.731 --> 34:52.598
An hour to make a clean sweep,
five minutes if we're lucky.

34:52.766 --> 34:53.893
Then get lucky.

34:54.069 --> 34:56.367
Callen, we found your smoking gun.

34:56.538 --> 34:59.599
An authorization
for a $100,000 cash payment

34:59.774 --> 35:01.299
to private eye Anthony Trager.

35:01.476 --> 35:03.774
A lot of money to be taking pictures
of an apartment.

35:03.945 --> 35:06.073
Trager resigned
rather than face corruption charges

35:06.247 --> 35:07.806
in the 1998 Rampart scandal.

35:07.983 --> 35:10.077
Those cops were accused
of beating suspects,

35:10.251 --> 35:13.482
planting evidence, and covering up
unprovoked shootings.

35:13.655 --> 35:17.717
Mr. Callen, if he's playing dirty,
then so must you.

35:20.261 --> 35:24.562
If you want answers,
turn on the news.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.966
- Tony Trager's in custody.
- Who?

35:29.137 --> 35:30.502
The ex-cop that paid you 10 grand.

35:30.672 --> 35:33.152
Fillmore and Western paid him
with marked bills, passed to you.

35:34.242 --> 35:36.472
Yeah, I did some carpentry
and plumbing at his house.

35:36.911 --> 35:39.642
Trager confessed.
His job was to make Rome disappear.

35:39.814 --> 35:42.909
Your job was to plant the bombs at the
apartment and scout out the rail yard.

35:43.084 --> 35:45.451
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

35:45.620 --> 35:48.220
- Pay you to blow up the motel too?
- And put bombs on the tracks?

35:48.356 --> 35:49.476
You asking me or telling me?

35:49.624 --> 35:51.388
If you have the answers,
why do you need me?

35:51.559 --> 35:53.960
This bomb goes off,
you're looking at the death penalty.

35:54.129 --> 35:55.324
What bomb?

35:55.497 --> 35:58.489
I have no idea what you're talking
about. It sounds like you don't, either.

35:58.933 --> 36:00.731
California
doesn't have the death penalty.

36:00.902 --> 36:04.805
California? No. We're talking
about an act of federal terrorism.

36:06.074 --> 36:08.475
We'll probably put him in Guantanamo
for his own safety.

36:08.643 --> 36:12.011
Save it. You're not scaring
a forced confession out of me.

36:12.747 --> 36:16.115
Yeah, he's right.
Leave it to the professionals.

36:16.284 --> 36:18.753
Have the rendition team get him
out of here.

36:20.855 --> 36:22.880
I hear those tube feedings
are delightful.

36:23.358 --> 36:24.587
Just out of curiosity,

36:24.759 --> 36:28.889
how do you say, uh, "bottoms up"
in Arabic?

36:30.832 --> 36:33.494
It's 36 ties from the switch.

36:33.668 --> 36:35.227
34, 35, 36.

36:39.874 --> 36:41.171
Less than a mile.

36:48.183 --> 36:50.208
- How's your speed?
- I'm down to 30.

36:50.385 --> 36:51.580
It's still too fast.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.046
You can bail, Mitch.
Jump out while you can.

36:55.223 --> 36:57.920
I can't let go of the throttle.
I have to try.

37:00.962 --> 37:02.396
Mom?

37:05.133 --> 37:06.897
I'm here.

37:07.802 --> 37:09.167
I'm sorry.

37:15.076 --> 37:18.239
There are people on the track
up ahead. Is that where the bomb is?

37:19.681 --> 37:21.240
You've got about 30 seconds.

37:22.350 --> 37:24.842
- Nothing but dirt.
- Bellamy's a liar. Let's go!

37:25.286 --> 37:28.017
Maybe he counted the switch
as number one.

37:30.191 --> 37:32.421
I can't stop in time.
Why aren't they moving?

37:32.594 --> 37:34.858
- You got an eye on the train, Sam?
- I see it.

37:36.998 --> 37:40.229
Bingo. Bricks of C-4 and a receiver.

37:43.404 --> 37:44.565
Get them off the track.

37:44.739 --> 37:45.900
I'm not gonna make it.

37:46.074 --> 37:47.200
Attacking the initiator.

37:49.210 --> 37:50.803
Pray the power dump
doesn't set it off.

37:51.980 --> 37:53.641
Don't be a fool! Get out!

38:01.122 --> 38:02.715
Sam?

38:24.012 --> 38:25.776
Piece of cake.

38:50.438 --> 38:53.965
- Hey.
- Well, hey, how are you two doing?

38:54.142 --> 38:56.702
- Great. Just finishing up some stuff.
- Good.

38:56.878 --> 38:59.176
- Hey, you know that guy, Rome?
- Yeah.

38:59.347 --> 39:03.181
- Hijacked a train.
- Yeah, I heard, huh? What a loser.

39:03.351 --> 39:05.319
Well, I guess
he won't be suing the railroad now.

39:05.486 --> 39:08.478
Ha, ha. Oh, not a chance.
Oh, listen, just out of curiosity,

39:08.656 --> 39:10.954
what are you, uh...?
What are you up to?

39:11.759 --> 39:12.954
Boring stuff.

39:13.127 --> 39:15.755
Pre-employment background checks,
that sort of thing. Heh.

39:15.930 --> 39:17.364
Gotta pay the bills, huh?

39:17.532 --> 39:19.227
Well, 90 grand pays a lot of bills.

39:21.803 --> 39:23.897
What have you got in your, uh...
Your murse there?

39:24.072 --> 39:26.473
You got 50s or 100s?

39:26.641 --> 39:28.200
Yeah, that's right.

39:28.543 --> 39:30.568
Bellamy told us everything.

39:31.012 --> 39:35.415
- Yeah, well, Bellamy's a lowlife scum.
- Who you were dumb enough to hire.

39:35.583 --> 39:37.574
Oh, come on, really?

39:37.752 --> 39:39.151
You're gonna shoot federal agents?

39:39.320 --> 39:40.879
You already murdered
a security guard.

39:41.055 --> 39:43.023
Bellamy couldn't make it,
so you filled in.

39:43.191 --> 39:44.659
Where did you learn Arabic?

39:44.826 --> 39:46.521
That Allahu Akbar,
that was a nice touch.

39:46.694 --> 39:48.719
- Very convincing.
- Mm. Yeah.

39:48.897 --> 39:53.061
Well, innocent until proven guilty.
Heh.

39:53.234 --> 39:55.100
I gotta go.

39:57.839 --> 39:59.398
Oh, thank you.

40:03.578 --> 40:04.602
I will take that.

40:05.813 --> 40:08.407
Sing along if you know the words.

40:08.583 --> 40:10.210
You have the right to remain silent.

40:10.385 --> 40:11.546
Anything you say can

40:11.719 --> 40:12.914
and will be used against you

40:13.087 --> 40:14.680
in a court of law.

40:18.826 --> 40:21.852
Forty-weights all around.
What is this?

40:22.030 --> 40:23.691
Oh, don't even ask.

40:23.865 --> 40:25.128
Why does she need the reports?

40:25.300 --> 40:28.061
Because we got about a hundred
federal agencies begging for the intel.

40:28.202 --> 40:29.692
DHS, FBI,

40:29.871 --> 40:33.136
NRC, DOJ, DOT, TSA.

40:33.308 --> 40:34.969
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Where's Deeks?

40:36.344 --> 40:38.574
Oh, I think I just broke a hoof. Ugh.

40:39.681 --> 40:42.275
- Transformer's looking pretty good.
- Here you go.

40:42.450 --> 40:43.490
- Ah. Thank you.
- Welcome.

40:43.651 --> 40:45.210
Yeah, it was a gift from Mitch Rome.

40:45.386 --> 40:48.481
He let me babysit it for a few months
until he gets out of prison.

40:48.656 --> 40:50.317
You may not wanna run this thing
tonight.

40:50.491 --> 40:52.289
Yeah, not for a couple weeks.

40:52.460 --> 40:54.326
At least
not until Mercury's out of retrograde.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.964
You guys can laugh it up all you want,

40:57.131 --> 41:00.396
but, uh, did anyone's travel plans
go awry today?

41:00.568 --> 41:02.764
Just like every day on the 405.

41:02.937 --> 41:05.304
Come on, you guys, there were signs
everywhere. Mitch Rome.

41:05.473 --> 41:08.499
Mercury's a Roman god.
The name of the bus station.

41:08.676 --> 41:10.144
- What about it?
- Maximus Lines.

41:10.311 --> 41:13.508
That's the, uh, home temple
of Mercury, the Circus Maximus.

41:14.882 --> 41:17.214
- In ancient Rome, they spoke Latin.
- Yeah.

41:17.385 --> 41:21.583
- And on the radio today, Latin music.
- He's right.

41:23.157 --> 41:25.353
You two are pretty cute together.
But the fact is

41:25.526 --> 41:27.966
you couldn't disarm the bomb
because it had a mercury trigger.

41:28.096 --> 41:30.690
I'm just...
I'm thinking that's interesting. Huh?

41:30.865 --> 41:33.994
You're going to chisel your report
in stone, Mr. Deeks?

41:34.168 --> 41:37.331
Yeah, I was just putting
the last final touches on it.

41:40.041 --> 41:45.104
- This?
- That is an Airfix Prairie Tank.

41:45.279 --> 41:48.146
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's a classic.

41:48.316 --> 41:50.717
- Tis, indeed.
- Does it work?

41:50.885 --> 41:52.353
Yeah, this is gonna be great.

41:52.520 --> 41:53.960
Christmas is coming early this year.

41:54.122 --> 41:56.562
I've been dreaming about this, Hetty,
since I was 5 years old.

42:00.194 --> 42:02.026
Hetty,
I haven't fully secured the tracks.

42:02.196 --> 42:04.858
Hetty, make it stop. Hetty! No! Aah!

42:06.034 --> 42:07.559
Mercury's a bitch, ain't it?
