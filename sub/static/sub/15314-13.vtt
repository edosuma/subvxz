00:21.187 --> 00:22.711
Sheriff?

00:23.490 --> 00:25.754
Nasir... my dear boy.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.193
Karim.

00:33.299 --> 00:35.096
Very good.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.701
Oh, very good.

00:38.772 --> 00:44.142
- What is our plan?
- You... are going to visit King Richard.

00:45.812 --> 00:48.781
You... are Saladin's new messenger.

00:48.848 --> 00:50.679
Salah al-Din's royal seal.

00:51.618 --> 00:55.452
- Where did you get this?
- Saladin's old messenger.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.753
- But there is also a password.
- Yes, it was very difficult getting that.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.794
It was like pulling teeth.
It was... pulling teeth.

01:01.861 --> 01:05.227
When we get in... I kill him?

01:05.298 --> 01:09.394
No, no, no. You won't get to within
a thousand yards of the King's tent.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.563
I want you to lure him out.

01:12.639 --> 01:14.106
How?

01:14.174 --> 01:16.870
By telling him what he wants to hear.

01:16.943 --> 01:18.638
Peace.

01:19.546 --> 01:22.413
Nothing... can stop us now.

01:23.516 --> 01:26.713
Right, lads... work to do.

01:27.787 --> 01:32.690
Save Marian, save the King...
save England.

02:23.343 --> 02:25.504
Food. You should eat.

02:25.578 --> 02:30.015
Guy, listen to me. Now that Robin is dead,
you are the King's last chance.

02:30.083 --> 02:33.541
If you save him from this plot,
he will reward you

02:33.653 --> 02:35.314
with position and wealth.

02:35.388 --> 02:37.754
You'll have everything you wanted.

02:37.857 --> 02:41.122
And saving him from this plot,
how would that work?

02:48.701 --> 02:50.464
Kill the Sheriff.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.903
The King will reward you.

02:53.806 --> 02:55.637
And...

02:58.278 --> 03:00.439
And I will reward you.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.037
How?

03:04.083 --> 03:05.846
If you save the King...

03:07.554 --> 03:09.852
I will willingly give you my hand.

03:13.393 --> 03:16.851
He is a Black Knight.
I will trust him with my life.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.329
Ah, here he is now.

03:18.398 --> 03:23.028
Well... how's our leper friend?

03:26.005 --> 03:27.870
Whingeing, as usual.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.306
And what if the King's moved on?
What if he isn't in Acre?

03:33.379 --> 03:35.347
Well, then we find Djaq's uncle's friend.

03:35.415 --> 03:38.009
- Bassam.
- I'll go check upstairs, OK?

03:38.084 --> 03:40.143
What's Bassam do, then?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.279
The pigeon-handler.
Remember Lardner?

03:42.355 --> 03:44.346
Oh, the bird the Sheriff got
with his buzzard.

03:44.457 --> 03:47.051
- That's what you think.
- I switched the pigeons.

03:47.126 --> 03:49.754
You're joking. Oh, nice one.

03:49.862 --> 03:52.057
So you got a message to the King
in the end, yeah?

03:52.131 --> 03:54.361
Yeah. Well, no thanks to you.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.561
Oh, look, I've told you a thousand times
I'm sorry, boys, all right?

03:57.637 --> 03:59.332
I'm back now. I'm one of the lads...

03:59.405 --> 04:02.033
Hands up who hasn't betrayed the group.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.440
- Oh, this one again. How clever.
- Just leave it, Much.

04:04.510 --> 04:05.738
Sorry.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.746
- We just want to find the King.
- And Marian.

04:08.881 --> 04:10.371
And Marian.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.041
Robin.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.955
I want to show you something.

04:18.124 --> 04:20.285
- See those two guards there?
- Mm-hm.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.888
Saracen soldiers. That means this town
is back in the hands of my people.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.694
The town is under curfew
and it will be dangerous.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.964
The bad news is...
your king will not be here.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.833
Right.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.636
We find your friend, Bassam.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.313
Can I ask you something?

05:18.384 --> 05:24.380
Being back here... in the Holy Land...
do you feel funny?

05:25.525 --> 05:27.686
Cos I feel funny.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.853
We're the enemy again.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.258
If these people knew we were English...

05:39.439 --> 05:42.636
- If we don't find Marian...
- Marian... Marian...

05:42.709 --> 05:45.678
- Marian, Marian, Marian...
- We will.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.144
Marian...

05:47.213 --> 05:49.773
- If we don't get Marian back...
- We will find Marian.

05:49.882 --> 05:51.076
Robin.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.986
Get a grip, Marian.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.463
Robin's dead.

06:15.808 --> 06:18.368
Saracens!

06:40.733 --> 06:42.564
Three more this way!

06:56.849 --> 06:59.215
- Bassam's house?
- This way.

06:59.318 --> 07:00.410
Go, go, go, go.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.149
These are Bassam's birds.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.654
It's as beautiful as I remember it.

07:13.499 --> 07:16.093
- Safia?
- Bassam.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.499
- You're still alive!
- So are you!

07:21.574 --> 07:25.271
Me, I'm always alive.
My body might fall to bits

07:25.344 --> 07:27.812
but I'll still have to tend to these birds.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.472
But you love them.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.380
I love you.

07:38.057 --> 07:41.356
When I was a little girl,
I loved these birds.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.196
I thought that when I grew up

07:44.263 --> 07:46.891
I would live here and train them.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.862
The closest I'd ever get to flight.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.398
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.208
Yeah, I do, actually.

07:57.276 --> 07:58.868
- Bismillah.
- Bismillah.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.071
Bismillah.

08:04.116 --> 08:05.981
He speaks our language.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.745
Well, you speak mine. Seems only fair.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.287
I need to find our king.

08:13.392 --> 08:16.623
- Why should I help you?
- Because his life is in danger.

08:16.696 --> 08:20.860
You want to save him so that he can
continue waging war against our people?

08:20.933 --> 08:22.491
No.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.593
I want to take him home
and make peace.

08:25.471 --> 08:28.804
So he can save his own people
from some very unpleasant men.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.469
Robin is a man of peace.

08:31.577 --> 08:32.976
Trust him.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.812
Please.

08:41.787 --> 08:45.086
His camp is to the north. I'll show you.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.421
- In the morning.
- Thank you.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.255
Robin Hood. Not possible.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.691
Here in Acre, with his men,
looking for the King.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.262
- Not a problem.
- How so?

09:24.330 --> 09:28.426
They're still looking for him
so they haven't found him yet. Hm?

09:28.501 --> 09:31.902
We are going to add
a little something extra

09:32.004 --> 09:33.972
to Saladin's message to the King.

09:34.941 --> 09:37.501
We are going to get King Richard...

09:38.678 --> 09:40.908
to kill Robin Hood.

10:08.808 --> 10:11.504
I am the envoy of His Royal Highness
Prince Salah al-Din,

10:11.611 --> 10:14.045
rightful ruler of these lands,

10:14.113 --> 10:16.274
master of the Ayyubid dynasty.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.909
Yeah? And I'm the King of England.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.368
Thank you, Carter.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.201
Get over there!

10:43.275 --> 10:44.867
Keep still.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.679
- Go on!
- Take him to the King's tent.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.078
Get over there!

10:49.148 --> 10:52.584
Quartermaster, tell him
three dozen breastplates by sundown.

10:55.621 --> 10:58.784
- Where is your king?
- I rule from the front line.

10:58.858 --> 11:01.622
That's why your prince
will never defeat me.

11:05.264 --> 11:09.428
- I admire... Aristotle.
- I prefer Plato.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.672
You have the password.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.172
Speak.

11:15.241 --> 11:18.677
My prince has considered
your calls for peace.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.473
- Oh?
- He promises nothing.

11:20.579 --> 11:23.173
But he is prepared to talk.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.677
My prince agrees to meet you,
man to man.

11:27.787 --> 11:30.017
Alone in the desert.

11:30.089 --> 11:31.681
Where?

11:31.791 --> 11:36.023
Outside Imuiz,
the town ruined by your crusaders.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.996
- When?
- Today. Noon.

11:39.065 --> 11:41.761
Your Majesty, is this wise?

11:44.637 --> 11:47.299
My prince knew it.
You do not want peace.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.705
Wait.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.710
I'll be there.

11:53.946 --> 11:57.313
My prince offers you a gift...

11:58.117 --> 12:00.551
as a sign of his goodwill.

12:00.619 --> 12:03.850
- What gift?
- The gift of life.

12:08.694 --> 12:10.093
Leave us.

12:12.932 --> 12:18.893
There are... men... in your country
who would want to kill you.

12:18.971 --> 12:21.064
Tell him I already know
about the Black Knights.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.768
- They know you know.
- And I will deal with them when I return.

12:23.843 --> 12:27.904
That is why they have recruited
your most loyal servant to come here.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.675
- Who?
- He is a man that you would trust...

12:30.750 --> 12:35.483
with your life.
And he travels with a Saracen woman.

12:35.554 --> 12:37.920
He will offer to protect you.

12:38.023 --> 12:42.483
And then... when your guard is down...

12:44.029 --> 12:46.657
he will slit your throat.

12:57.143 --> 12:59.976
- This meeting. I'll come with you.
- No.

13:00.846 --> 13:03.906
Your Majesty,
to meet Saladin alone, unprotected...

13:04.016 --> 13:06.678
Sometimes peace requires
more bravery than war.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.024
Have you thought about what I said?

13:14.693 --> 13:17.423
You are a decent man, Guy.
You're not a killer.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.922
Turn against the Sheriff.

13:22.234 --> 13:26.694
This is your chance...
your last chance to be a good man.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.985
Good chat with Marian?

13:42.121 --> 13:44.089
Anything you want to tell me?

13:47.226 --> 13:48.853
No.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.600
She wants me to kill you.

13:58.137 --> 14:00.230
And are you going to?

14:08.948 --> 14:10.438
No.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.252
What was her suggestion?

14:15.221 --> 14:19.555
Oh, I would kill you...
She would vouch for me.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.593
The King would reward me.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.819
I would still win power
and I would also win...

14:24.897 --> 14:26.592
Marian.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.897
But you chose me.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.837
My lord, I've demonstrated my loyalty.
Now I'd like your blessing.

14:34.907 --> 14:37.432
- For what?
- I will still have Marian.

14:38.310 --> 14:41.177
When we return to England
I will take her by force.

14:41.247 --> 14:42.646
Mm.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.775
Dear boy... I'll sing at your wedding.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.631
There. Your king's camp.

15:06.705 --> 15:08.400
Shukran, Bassam.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.976
Does he understand flight, the pale one?

15:17.049 --> 15:18.880
Who?

15:19.952 --> 15:22.284
Yes. I think he does.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.513
You have my blessing.

15:30.329 --> 15:32.695
My name is Robin of Locksley
and these are my friends,

15:32.798 --> 15:34.561
the King's loyal subjects.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.864
More than that, my master and I
served in his private guard.

15:37.937 --> 15:42.101
- We have urgent business with the King.
- Saving his life, actually.

15:42.207 --> 15:45.438
John, look, the King's tent!

15:45.511 --> 15:48.844
Ut prosim! Our motto. Latin.

15:48.914 --> 15:50.882
What does it mean?

15:52.885 --> 15:55.513
That was us. Good days.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.384
Well, not good.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.448
The death, destruction, all that.
But... you know.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.084
Ut prosim, lads.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.493
- Robin!
- Carter!

16:07.499 --> 16:11.401
- I thought you'd given up fighting.
- I'm still fighting. But for peace.

16:13.105 --> 16:15.096
Looks like we're finally making progress.

16:16.608 --> 16:19.600
- Robin of Locksley.
- Your Majesty.

16:19.678 --> 16:22.806
Ah, I should bow before you, friend.

16:22.881 --> 16:23.905
Come.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.720
- Robin.
- Your Majesty.

16:34.026 --> 16:36.790
I bring grave news.
You received my messages, I trust?

16:36.862 --> 16:38.124
I did.

16:38.230 --> 16:41.290
The Sheriff of Nottingham and the
Black Knights are plotting against you.

16:41.367 --> 16:45.827
- They are planning to take over England.
- That's what you said and I believed you.

16:45.904 --> 16:49.032
But now the Sheriff is coming here
to find you and kill you.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.133
- Really?
- You have to let me protect you.

16:52.111 --> 16:54.739
- I must allow you to protect me?
- Yes.

17:05.124 --> 17:06.954
Oh, Robin.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.993
Of all people, you.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.551
- Your Majesty?
- Of all the men who have served me,

17:11.630 --> 17:13.859
- you were the one I loved most.
- I have cherished that.

17:13.932 --> 17:17.595
When I sent you home to England,
I thought you would represent me there.

17:17.669 --> 17:20.398
- In a small way, I think I have.
- Robin, stop it. I know the truth!

17:20.472 --> 17:22.906
What truth? Your Majesty,
you are in danger!

17:23.008 --> 17:25.476
Why? Have I not done right by you?

17:25.544 --> 17:27.842
Yes, you have.
And I've come here to save you.

17:27.913 --> 17:32.077
Still you deny it. You have come here
to murder your king!

17:32.184 --> 17:35.051
Your Majesty, no. I can vouch for Robin.
When I was in England...

17:35.120 --> 17:38.453
Quiet. You are a renowned marksman

17:38.524 --> 17:40.492
- with the bow, are you not?
- I am.

17:40.592 --> 17:43.288
Then you could have killed my enemies
a thousand times over.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.296
You expect me to believe you would
travel to the Holy Land to protect me,

17:46.398 --> 17:48.389
instead of simply
aiming an arrow in Nottingham?

17:48.467 --> 17:51.436
- Your Majesty, we couldn't just...
- Silence before the King!

17:53.038 --> 17:55.006
Assemble the men.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.976
Execute them.

18:01.513 --> 18:03.276
- Happiness?
- Happiness.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.577
- He'll attend the meeting?
- Mm-hm.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.883
And erm... watch out, watch out,
there's a Hood about.

18:09.955 --> 18:13.789
Ooh... come to daddy, eh?

18:16.195 --> 18:18.857
So, Karim, dear boy,
you know what to do.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.059
What if King Richard knows
what Prince Salah al-Din looks like?

18:23.202 --> 18:26.296
Well, no matter. You're not
stopping for a chat, are you, huh?

18:32.611 --> 18:36.069
Er... Gisborne, something I need to do.

18:36.148 --> 18:37.911
Go with them.

18:45.257 --> 18:47.987
Mercy, Your Majesty! Ut prosim!

18:48.060 --> 18:50.494
Your Majesty, these people are innocent.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.861
If you must take a life, take mine.
Spare them.

18:53.932 --> 18:57.197
At last. That's the Robin I remember -
considering others.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.237
He is still the Robin you remember.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.829
He saved your life.
Don't you remember that?

19:09.948 --> 19:12.109
I cannot grant your wish.
You must all be punished.

19:12.217 --> 19:15.015
But you once saved my life
and no, I have not forgotten that.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.112
So I'll not take yours.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.520
I'll let the desert decide.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.291
The desert.

19:23.362 --> 19:25.421
What does that mean?

19:25.497 --> 19:27.260
Decide what?

19:28.867 --> 19:30.858
This is the same as execution.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.928
Yes. But if God wills it,
there is always a chance.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.975
I'll not remember you this way, Robin.

19:38.043 --> 19:40.534
I'll remember you as
the hero who once saved my life.

19:40.612 --> 19:43.410
And I'll remember you as
the King who spent too long at war.

19:43.482 --> 19:47.009
It's clouded your judgment.
You've forgotten your people back home.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.556
You're right. It is time
to stop this fighting.

19:54.826 --> 19:58.193
I'm meeting Saladin today.
I will make peace with him.

19:58.263 --> 20:01.289
- And then I will go home to England.
- Good.

20:03.068 --> 20:06.037
At least my friends and I
will have achieved something.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.631
Goodbye.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.007
Good chicken.

20:18.083 --> 20:21.211
I owe you a debt of gratitude,
young lady.

20:22.521 --> 20:26.048
Thanks to you,
I know that Guy is loyal.

20:27.292 --> 20:32.753
Because... if you can't turn him with
your pretty little head, then nobody can.

20:32.831 --> 20:36.267
Your heart...
must be the coldest place on earth.

20:36.335 --> 20:40.032
Are you a little disappointed
that he told me about your offer?

20:40.105 --> 20:43.302
I'm surprised it took you so long,
to be quite honest with you.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.673
- I mean, I was really getting rather bored.
- And now I've served my purpose.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.179
You tried to kill me!

20:49.248 --> 20:51.580
Do you think I'm gonna let that pass?

20:51.650 --> 20:56.644
Robin Hood did not die in Nottingham.
Did you know this? Huh?

20:56.722 --> 20:59.782
Well, then... just as a treat,

20:59.858 --> 21:01.849
you can die together.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.690
This is good.

21:20.012 --> 21:23.641
- How long?
- In this heat, without water...

21:26.351 --> 21:29.650
I'm sorry, my love. I should have
made you stay with Bassam.

21:29.721 --> 21:32.690
I would never leave you, Will Scarlett.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.128
If we can just get through
to nightfall, then...

21:37.229 --> 21:39.129
- Then what?
- Then...

21:40.299 --> 21:43.632
- It'll be cooler.
- "Cooler". It'll be freezing.

21:43.702 --> 21:47.103
I know. But it won't be hot. This heat...

21:47.205 --> 21:50.800
Much... we do not have till nightfall.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.384
You know I love you all.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.385
John, Djaq, Will.

22:39.891 --> 22:41.688
Even you, Allan.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.425
Robin.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.457
Master...

22:51.503 --> 22:54.199
When I was serving the King
I was serving you.

22:56.842 --> 22:58.901
When I think of England
I think of you.

23:02.347 --> 23:04.008
Marian?

23:07.786 --> 23:09.481
Marian.

23:12.324 --> 23:17.193
See something.
I can really see something... coming.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.196
He's right.

23:23.201 --> 23:25.362
- Over here!
- H... help!

23:25.437 --> 23:28.270
- Help!
- Help!

23:28.340 --> 23:30.274
- Here!
- Help!

23:30.342 --> 23:33.436
- She's seen us!
- God is smiling on us!

23:34.312 --> 23:36.780
- Or Allah.
- Whichever God it is, I love him.

23:40.318 --> 23:42.115
It's the Sheriff.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.086
There is no God.

24:07.512 --> 24:09.810
See, that's the er... trouble
with foreign travel.

24:09.881 --> 24:14.511
Hm? You run into all the same people
that you see at home.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.587
Your leper friend.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.688
I understand
you've met my colleague, James.

24:20.759 --> 24:22.784
We meet again. Ha-ha!

24:22.861 --> 24:26.592
- You let the Black Knights buy you.
- Pennies from the poor put to good use.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.428
James.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.024
- You're revolting!
- Get off me!

24:30.101 --> 24:33.764
A revolt is when the people rise up
against their leader.

24:33.839 --> 24:37.275
No, I am not revolting. I am... coup-ing.

24:37.342 --> 24:42.439
Plotting a sudden and decisive
change of leader.

24:42.514 --> 24:44.505
What about murder?

24:44.616 --> 24:48.848
Oh, well, you see, if the King
will wander out into the desert

24:48.920 --> 24:51.980
alone, unarmed,
ready to meet his enemy, then...

24:52.057 --> 24:55.458
The King wants peace. You're killing
a man who's trying to make peace.

24:55.527 --> 24:58.621
Yes, life's usually so much fairer.

24:58.697 --> 25:01.131
Just let Marian go.
She's got nothing to do with this.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.997
She has everything to do with this! Hm?

25:04.903 --> 25:10.739
All along, we thought... we had a spy
in your camp!

25:12.611 --> 25:14.579
But you had one in ours.

25:15.847 --> 25:19.010
You see, there will always be
people that work for me.

25:19.084 --> 25:23.544
- Because I fight for justice.
- Oh, blah-di-blah-di-blah.

25:23.622 --> 25:27.956
But this... this one is a special one. Hm?

25:29.294 --> 25:33.094
You were still hoping -
weren't you, hey? - That after all this,

25:33.198 --> 25:37.396
you'd end up as man and wife
back home in sunny Sherwood. Aaahh.

25:37.469 --> 25:40.233
So... now you have your bride.

25:41.606 --> 25:45.007
I'd love to stay, but I don't tan well.

25:46.077 --> 25:49.376
Do excuse us. We have a king to kill.
Come along, James.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.417
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

26:00.492 --> 26:03.757
- We fought and we lost.
- Well, at least we will have died trying.

26:03.828 --> 26:07.059
I want to die in England. Sherwood.

26:07.132 --> 26:11.159
Come on, John. Today's a good day to die.
You're always saying it.

26:11.236 --> 26:14.364
Today is not a good day to die!

26:15.807 --> 26:17.775
I want to die in the arms...

26:18.810 --> 26:20.607
of my wife.

26:22.147 --> 26:27.016
And with my son... John... by my side.

26:27.085 --> 26:31.181
Hey, John, you're dying for England.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.281
Even if you're not there.

26:33.358 --> 26:35.087
I'm not being funny...

26:35.193 --> 26:37.684
It's the King of England
who put us here in the first place.

26:37.796 --> 26:39.855
The Sheriff spun him a story!

26:39.931 --> 26:42.798
The moment we arrived here
we were marked men.

26:44.102 --> 26:46.161
It's not the King's fault.

26:52.811 --> 26:54.779
Well, say the words, then, handsome.

26:56.047 --> 26:57.571
What words?

26:57.649 --> 27:02.382
"I, Robin, take you... Marian... "

27:04.422 --> 27:06.390
Now?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.722
Now is a good time, I think.

27:09.828 --> 27:13.821
We are in the company... of the best
witnesses England has to offer.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.900
I, Robin...

27:22.741 --> 27:25.767
take you, Marian,
to be my lawful wedded wife.

27:27.212 --> 27:29.407
To have and to hold...

27:29.481 --> 27:31.574
for better or for worse...

27:34.319 --> 27:38.312
for richer... or for poorer...

27:40.558 --> 27:42.458
"In sickness... "

27:44.262 --> 27:46.287
...in sickness or in health...

27:49.968 --> 27:52.027
to love and to cherish...

27:54.773 --> 27:56.741
till death do us part.

27:59.678 --> 28:04.115
I, Marian... take you, Robin of Locksley...

28:05.483 --> 28:08.509
master of the bow, champion of the poor

28:08.620 --> 28:10.451
and lord of my heart,

28:10.522 --> 28:12.683
to be my lawful wedded husband.

28:14.793 --> 28:18.024
I promise to love and to cherish you,

28:18.096 --> 28:20.894
for better or for worse,

28:20.999 --> 28:24.958
from this day forward...
as long as we both shall live.

28:28.073 --> 28:31.201
Much... don't cry.

28:33.511 --> 28:35.445
He's not crying.

28:35.513 --> 28:37.606
He's laughing
on the wrong side of his face.

28:37.682 --> 28:39.445
- Carter!
- Carter!

28:39.517 --> 28:42.042
- I thought you'd left us!
- Sorry.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.281
Out here, you can lose your head.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.788
- I thought I didn't like you!
- I know.

28:47.859 --> 28:50.225
Well... I do now.

28:50.295 --> 28:52.024
Thank God I've found you.

28:52.097 --> 28:55.794
- We have horses and we have weapons.
- And we have the King to rescue.

28:55.867 --> 28:58.859
- Come on. We are Robin Hood.
- What?

28:59.738 --> 29:03.299
- We'll explain later.
- No. Everybody say it.

29:03.408 --> 29:06.639
We... are Robin Hood. Say it!

29:06.711 --> 29:08.474
We are Robin Hood!

29:16.354 --> 29:18.584
The desert decided.

29:22.127 --> 29:24.595
Where have you been?
You nearly missed the show.

29:25.697 --> 29:27.289
Oh, er... Delhi belly.

29:27.365 --> 29:30.994
- Where's Marian?
- She's er... tied up.

29:33.338 --> 29:35.306
This is good. This is very good.

29:56.861 --> 30:00.058
- I am not really Salah al-Din!
- I am not really King Richard.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.291
It's Robin Hood!

30:01.366 --> 30:03.630
- You should be dead!
- Many times over, my friend.

30:03.701 --> 30:05.032
Many times.

30:07.705 --> 30:11.402
- Now do you believe us?
- I've betrayed your loyalty.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.205
How can I repay you?

30:14.479 --> 30:18.609
Actually... I know this is not the time,
Your Majesty,

30:18.683 --> 30:22.016
but there is a place in Nottingham
called Bonchurch. I've had my eye on...

30:22.086 --> 30:24.611
- Much!
- Sorry. Forget about it.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.465
He needs us.

30:41.306 --> 30:42.830
Marian!

30:51.115 --> 30:53.879
- Robin, forgive me.
- I already have.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.786
Let's finish this now! After them!

31:17.909 --> 31:19.968
It's not too late! We can still get the King!

31:20.044 --> 31:22.444
You two, over there! Gisborne, with me.

31:38.062 --> 31:41.190
- This is a trap. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.897
- Where's the King?
- He went after the Sheriff.

31:45.003 --> 31:46.994
We need to get him out of here. Now!

31:58.283 --> 32:00.649
Keep them pinned down.
I'll go round the back.

32:03.688 --> 32:07.317
Quickly, you must get out of here.
Leave them to me.

32:17.635 --> 32:19.762
It's not right. Split up!

32:35.119 --> 32:36.177
Come on.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.674
Long live the King!

33:02.847 --> 33:04.109
No.

33:22.867 --> 33:24.232
Bye-bye, Blondie.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.132
We meet again.

33:39.650 --> 33:41.015
Guy!

33:46.557 --> 33:48.184
Stop!

33:48.259 --> 33:50.921
- It's over, Guy.
- Get out of the way.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.929
All this time
I've been fighting for England.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.397
Do you think I am going to
let you kill England?

33:55.466 --> 33:57.400
Marian, get out of the way!

33:57.468 --> 34:01.461
- You'll have to kill me first.
- No. We're going to get out of this.

34:02.240 --> 34:06.301
I'm going to do this thing
and then I will have power beyond measure.

34:06.411 --> 34:07.901
And we will be together.

34:10.313 --> 34:13.875
I would rather die than be with you,
Guy of Gisborne.

34:13.951 --> 34:15.384
No.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.549
I'm going to marry Robin Hood.

34:23.628 --> 34:25.619
I love Robin Hood.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.301
I love Robin Hood.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.052
Marian!

34:57.128 --> 34:58.959
No!

35:08.272 --> 35:09.762
Gisborne!

35:11.309 --> 35:13.243
It's not over, Hood!

35:16.314 --> 35:19.408
I will have... England!

35:33.731 --> 35:36.928
- The King! Where's the King?
- He's all right. Marian. Marian.

35:37.034 --> 35:38.831
He's all right. You saved him.

35:38.903 --> 35:43.397
How's it looking down there?
Am I beyond even Djaq's amazing talent?

35:43.474 --> 35:45.271
It's all right. We'll think of something.

35:45.343 --> 35:49.006
Well, can we at least
get this out of me? It hurts.

35:50.882 --> 35:54.010
Marian... Marian, we can't
take it out just yet.

35:54.085 --> 35:55.780
Why?

35:57.155 --> 35:58.622
Why?

36:02.426 --> 36:05.088
Will I die when it comes out?

36:12.103 --> 36:14.697
Then we haven't got much time,
my darling.

36:14.772 --> 36:17.138
We have forever, my love.

36:17.975 --> 36:19.738
I hope we have forever in heaven

36:19.844 --> 36:22.039
because we didn't have
enough time on earth.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.275
Not nearly enough time.

36:25.349 --> 36:28.250
- We were busy.
- We were fighters and I'm proud.

36:29.120 --> 36:33.489
- You keep fighting for me, Robin.
- I... I can't fight without you.

36:33.558 --> 36:36.049
I'd love to argue with you,
but we haven't got the time.

36:37.461 --> 36:40.294
You promise me you'll keep fighting.

36:42.099 --> 36:43.794
I will.

36:47.738 --> 36:50.206
Now, where were we?

36:50.274 --> 36:52.071
What?

36:52.143 --> 36:55.840
The last time we were dying...
we were getting married.

36:55.913 --> 36:57.847
Can we carry on, please?

36:58.716 --> 37:00.843
I can't remember.

37:00.918 --> 37:04.410
Well, that's the last time I marry you,
if you can't even remember.

37:04.488 --> 37:05.887
Robin.

37:11.996 --> 37:13.486
Here.

37:17.235 --> 37:21.069
I, Robin, take you, Marian,
to be my wedded wife.

37:21.138 --> 37:23.868
To have and to hold,
from this day forward...

37:24.842 --> 37:26.867
for better or for worse...

37:27.878 --> 37:29.846
for richer or for poorer,

37:29.914 --> 37:32.075
in sickness or in health...

37:33.284 --> 37:37.243
to love and to cherish...
till death do us part.

37:39.657 --> 37:42.387
I, Marian, take you, Robin...

37:43.728 --> 37:48.097
beautiful, beautiful Lord of Locksley,
to be my wedded husband.

37:49.667 --> 37:54.195
I promise to love you
and to cherish you... on earth...

37:55.039 --> 37:57.007
and especially in heaven.

37:59.910 --> 38:03.903
For now and forever...
till death do us part.

38:06.217 --> 38:07.684
Kiss me.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.443
No.

38:11.322 --> 38:13.483
Give me the ring first.

38:13.557 --> 38:16.492
Make an honest woman of me, Robin.

38:20.531 --> 38:22.522
You may kiss the bride.

38:27.138 --> 38:30.005
I love you... my husband.

38:30.074 --> 38:32.201
I love you, my wife.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.613
Shh...

38:47.158 --> 38:48.989
That's better.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.795
Marian.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.267
Marian.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.814
You take care, OK?

40:52.883 --> 40:54.510
Robin.

41:00.357 --> 41:02.416
Will and I are...

41:04.962 --> 41:07.795
You're staying.

41:20.845 --> 41:22.608
Come here.

41:22.680 --> 41:25.046
- Look after her.
- Thank you.

41:35.459 --> 41:37.017
Robin.

41:56.146 --> 41:57.977
You've saved my life.

42:01.285 --> 42:03.253
Now go home and grieve your loss.

42:03.320 --> 42:06.483
No, Your Majesty.
For every man, there is a purpose

42:06.557 --> 42:08.525
which he sets up in his life.

42:10.127 --> 42:12.459
Let yours be the doing of all good deeds.

42:16.100 --> 42:17.658
The Koran.

42:17.735 --> 42:20.431
Then do those deeds in my name.

42:20.504 --> 42:23.166
You are my representatives in England.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.674
You are King Richard.

42:27.077 --> 42:28.339
- And you?
- Us?

42:29.246 --> 42:31.544
We are... Robin Hood.

42:32.349 --> 42:36.410
- Yes.
- We are Robin Hood!

42:38.989 --> 42:40.786
Come on, lads.

42:41.725 --> 42:43.022
Let's go home.
