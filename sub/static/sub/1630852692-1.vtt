WEBVTT

00:06.132 --> 00:09.468
[narrator] Long ago,
in another realm

00:09.468 --> 00:13.556
stood the majestic kingdom
of Tal'Dorei.

00:13.556 --> 00:16.559
Once the battlefield
of gods and titans,

00:16.559 --> 00:21.772
its lands now harbor magic,
wonder and mystery.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.983
It was a time of peace...

00:25.776 --> 00:29.488
...until a great evil arrived.

00:29.488 --> 00:33.951
A brave group of heroes
banded together,

00:33.951 --> 00:36.412
ready to face this evil.

00:36.412 --> 00:40.082
Hold fast. The beast approaches.

00:40.082 --> 00:42.001
[beast snarling]

00:47.423 --> 00:48.799
[whooshing]

00:48.799 --> 00:50.593
- [screams]
- What the fuck?

00:50.593 --> 00:53.429
You shall pay for y...

00:53.429 --> 00:55.848
- Holy sh...
- [screams]

00:55.848 --> 00:58.559
Humanity will never fall to y...

01:02.563 --> 01:07.485
[narrator] Well,
that was... something.

01:07.485 --> 01:09.445
Fuck!

01:09.445 --> 01:12.948
All of our mercenaries
slaughtered like lambs.

01:12.948 --> 01:15.075
I state my case again,
Sovereign Uriel:

01:15.075 --> 01:17.787
send our army to challenge
whatever this fiend is

01:17.787 --> 01:20.289
before it decimates
the entire kingdom.

01:20.289 --> 01:21.916
[Fince] Perhaps
we have been ill-advised

01:21.916 --> 01:23.918
in our strategy, sire.

01:23.918 --> 01:26.587
I propose we attempt
to capture the beast

01:26.587 --> 01:29.340
and use it as a weapon
against our enemies.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.549
I must object, Sir Fince.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.301
We don't even know
what the creature is.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.428
Demon? Elemental?

01:34.428 --> 01:36.222
And how do you propose
we capture it?

01:36.222 --> 01:37.932
Lady Allura is right.

01:37.932 --> 01:40.684
- But sire...
- I will not send
our remaining army

01:40.684 --> 01:44.647
beyond the city walls until we
know who or what our enemy is.

01:44.647 --> 01:46.357
We must find more mercenaries.

01:46.357 --> 01:47.900
And where, might I ask?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.944
The Torian Butchers
are butchered,

01:49.944 --> 01:54.073
the Murder Hobos murdered,
the Death Dealers are all dead.

01:54.073 --> 01:56.951
- Then find someone worthy!
- [gasps]

01:56.951 --> 01:58.911
Do not rest until you bring me

01:58.911 --> 02:03.207
the greatest band of mercenaries
in all of Tal'Dorei.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.042
[people chanting] Chug,
chug, chug!

02:05.042 --> 02:07.002
Chug! Chug! Chug!

02:09.505 --> 02:12.216
[grunting, exhales]

02:12.216 --> 02:13.968
- [cheering]
- Yeah!

02:13.968 --> 02:16.095
That's right! Who's the best?

02:16.095 --> 02:17.721
Yeah!

02:17.721 --> 02:20.599
Grog wins. Again.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.226
[sighs] Fuck me.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.061
Why do we always play
drinking games

02:24.061 --> 02:25.938
with a guy twice our size?

02:25.938 --> 02:28.774
Because it's the fastest way
to get drunk, obviously.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.860
[slurring] Who's drunk?

02:30.860 --> 02:32.528
Not me. I'm great.

02:32.528 --> 02:35.531
I think we should
go to another...

02:35.531 --> 02:37.324
another... [retches]

02:37.324 --> 02:39.910
Didn't you only have one ale?

02:39.910 --> 02:42.204
[gags] Oh. So chunky.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.039
[groans] Watch it, bitch.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.833
[grunts]

02:45.833 --> 02:48.002
Hey. You watch it, dicknose.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.545
Easy, Grog.

02:49.545 --> 02:52.214
We don't waste our time
on talking assholes, remember?

02:52.214 --> 02:54.216
- Hmm.
- Oi, tavern keep.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.260
Another round for Vox Machina,

02:56.260 --> 02:59.597
the greatest band of mercenaries
in all the realm.

02:59.597 --> 03:02.182
[laughs] The greatest?

03:02.182 --> 03:05.019
I heard you couldn't even rescue
a cow from a burning barn.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.228
[laughter]

03:06.228 --> 03:09.565
"Vox Machina."
What a fucking joke.

03:11.942 --> 03:15.321
[Vax] Let's keep things civil,
friend.

03:15.321 --> 03:17.114
We're not looking for trouble.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.033
- Oh, I'll bet you ain't.
- [people gasping]

03:19.033 --> 03:21.827
Everyone knows you're a bunch
of pathetic losers

03:21.827 --> 03:24.455
who can't get a fucking job.

03:24.455 --> 03:26.206
Look at your scrawny ass.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.376
Too weak to tickle
your own pickle.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.753
Are you offering to help?

03:30.753 --> 03:34.340
Yeah. U-Uh, well, no.
I... fuck you!

03:34.340 --> 03:36.592
Oh, I'm only asking you
to give me a hand.

03:38.469 --> 03:40.304
- [screams]
- [snarls]

03:40.304 --> 03:41.847
[Grog] You know, Vax,
I think he's willing.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.058
Ooh, can I keep this?

03:44.058 --> 03:47.436
[grunts] Don't just stand there
gawking, louts.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.771
Kill them!

03:48.771 --> 03:50.522
[snarls, grunts]

03:50.522 --> 03:52.524
[all shouting]

04:00.324 --> 04:01.951
[belches]

04:07.623 --> 04:09.875
[both] I had him.

04:12.670 --> 04:13.879
- [gun clicks]
- Hmm.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.508
- I'm coming, Percy!
- Oh, no.

04:18.968 --> 04:20.427
Oops.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.055
- [snarls]
- [roars]

04:25.307 --> 04:27.309
Pike, love, can you try to stay
out of the way?

04:27.309 --> 04:30.729
Hey, come on.
You tripped over me.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.856
I'll take that.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.608
Not bad, brother.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.110
- [whistles]
- [shouts]

04:46.704 --> 04:49.748
Why does this happen every time
we go out drinking?

04:53.419 --> 04:55.004
[whistles]

04:55.004 --> 04:57.131
[roars]

04:57.131 --> 04:58.590
Good boy, Trinket.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.800
Over here.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.678
[screams]

05:06.932 --> 05:08.809
Grog, step aside.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.769
Oh, bollocks.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.563
Where the hell is Scanlan?

05:12.563 --> 05:14.523

05:14.523 --> 05:16.316

05:22.990 --> 05:24.616

- For goodness' sakes.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.909
Percy, the hell, man?

05:25.909 --> 05:27.453
If you want to join in,
you got to ask first.

05:27.453 --> 05:29.413
Scanlan, I should've known.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.041
Could you put on some pants
and help us?

05:35.961 --> 05:39.089
You got to be shitting me.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.716
Stop!

05:42.051 --> 05:44.470
First, you people drink me dry,

05:44.470 --> 05:46.972
then you destroy my tavern.

05:46.972 --> 05:50.100
And-and what is that gnome
doing with my daughter?

05:50.100 --> 05:51.810
- [squealing laughter]
- Mmm... [chuckles]

05:51.810 --> 05:53.270
It's probably best
you don't know.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.231
Who's paying for all this?

05:56.231 --> 05:59.568
Goodness, such a mess.
Absolutely dreadful.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.361
But I can assure you, darling,

06:01.361 --> 06:02.905
Vox Machina will find
those responsible...

06:02.905 --> 06:05.032
Uh-uh, don't even try it.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.867
Money, now.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.660
Well, you see...

06:08.660 --> 06:11.580
We don't exactly have any money
on us, per se,

06:11.580 --> 06:13.248
but if you give me five...

06:13.248 --> 06:16.668
[all screaming]

06:16.668 --> 06:19.421
Uh, hello? Yes, excuse me.

06:19.421 --> 06:20.589
Ah. [chuckles]

06:20.589 --> 06:22.216
Thank you, much appreciated.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.760
[tavern keeper] And stay out!

06:24.760 --> 06:27.304
Does this mean
we're officially banned

06:27.304 --> 06:29.640
from every tavern in Emon?

06:29.640 --> 06:31.391
[grunts] Wonderful.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.019
We've got no money,
no place to live

06:34.019 --> 06:35.854
and fuck all for prospects.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.816
Well, perhaps if someone
didn't accidentally decapitate

06:38.816 --> 06:40.442
the last fellow who hired us.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.694
Well, I apologized, didn't I?

06:42.694 --> 06:45.405
We have a mountain of debts
and-- oh, good--

06:45.405 --> 06:47.324
three silver to our name.

06:47.324 --> 06:50.869
We need a job.
Anything, at this point.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.163
I mean, if protecting carts
from swindlers

06:53.163 --> 06:56.083
and killing goblins for gold
isn't getting us anywhere,

06:56.083 --> 06:58.752
I don't know, maybe...

06:58.752 --> 07:02.089
maybe we could try
doing some good this time?

07:03.132 --> 07:04.633
- Nah...
- Boring.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.760
Pike, ethics are a luxury

07:06.760 --> 07:08.679
we currently can't afford.

07:08.679 --> 07:11.265
Have you guys ever thought

07:11.265 --> 07:14.476
maybe we're not really meant
to do this?

07:14.476 --> 07:16.228
I mean, Vex and Vax

07:16.228 --> 07:19.314
- only care about themselves.
- [both] Well, fuck you.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.317
- [Keyleth] Grog just
wants to murder everyone.
- Yeah, pretty much.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.736
[Keyleth] Percy barely wants
to be seen with us in public,

07:24.736 --> 07:27.865
- and Scanlan wants...
- To bed everyone in the realm.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.576
Yes, you can say it, Keyleth.
I'm not ashamed.

07:30.576 --> 07:35.706
[sighs] Honestly,
why are we even together?

07:39.168 --> 07:41.587
Well, while you're all
moping around,

07:41.587 --> 07:44.756
I have to drain
the proverbial basilisk.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.466
[whistling]

07:48.844 --> 07:50.846
[sighs]

07:50.846 --> 07:52.514
Hmm?

07:52.514 --> 07:55.726
- [grunts, shouts]
- Oh... Oh, apologies.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.811
- [chuckles] It has a mind
of its own sometimes.
- [stammers]

07:57.811 --> 07:59.813
What's the matter with you?

07:59.813 --> 08:02.316
- Come on.
- Hmm.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.109
[Scanlan] This!

08:04.109 --> 08:05.819
This is our purpose.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.906
Fighting for justice, for glory,

08:08.906 --> 08:10.782
protecting the kingdom
and stuff.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.826
And most importantly--
[whoops]--

08:12.826 --> 08:15.787
lots of money!

08:17.372 --> 08:18.582
[snarls]

08:18.582 --> 08:20.584
[birds chirping]

08:24.588 --> 08:26.465
[grunts] We're really gonna see
the sovereign

08:26.465 --> 08:28.217
looking like this?

08:28.217 --> 08:29.509
[guard] Halt.

08:32.304 --> 08:36.099
Okay, we'll take you in,
but the bear waits outside.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.393
[growls]

08:41.521 --> 08:43.899
[sniffs, grunts]

08:43.899 --> 08:46.902
It's okay, buddy.
We'll be back soon.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.904
[growls]

08:50.113 --> 08:52.574
[Uriel] Lady Kima,
it is imperative

08:52.574 --> 08:54.993
Lord and Lady Briarwood join us.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.746
-Sire, Whitestone hasn't
been heard from in months.
-[Keyleth] Excuse me?

08:57.746 --> 08:59.289
- Our last messenger
never returned.
- Excuse me?

08:59.289 --> 09:01.333
[Uriel] They must be
warned of these attacks.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.210
- Send another guardsman
straight away.
- [belches]

09:03.210 --> 09:05.921
[belch echoes]

09:07.965 --> 09:10.175
I'm sorry, who the hell are you?

09:10.175 --> 09:12.052
Vox Machina. You see,

09:12.052 --> 09:14.429
it's actually a somewhat clever
play on words...

09:14.429 --> 09:15.847
Honestly, we don't care.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.307
Sire, I warned you

09:17.307 --> 09:20.394
the notices would attract
the scum of Emon.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.687
Excuse you?

09:21.687 --> 09:23.772
I think Sir Fince
means a foe this deadly

09:23.772 --> 09:26.400
- requires more seasoned...
- Krieg, don't bother

09:26.400 --> 09:28.026
with these drunken buffoons.

Guards?

- Uh, thank you very much.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.738
- Oh.
- Mm, okay. Uh...

10:54.738 --> 10:56.531
- Uh...
- Give the council a moment

10:56.531 --> 10:59.618
to discuss your curious group.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.286
You can't be seriously
considering them

11:01.286 --> 11:03.163
for such a crucial task.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.708
Sovereign, their reputation
is less than stellar.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.919
Well, they do have a bear.

11:08.919 --> 11:11.963
It looked quite ferocious.
And the song was entertaining.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.132
Why not give them a chance?

11:14.132 --> 11:15.675
Perhaps there is more
than meets the eye

11:15.675 --> 11:16.885
with these warriors.

11:16.885 --> 11:20.055
- [snoring]
- Eh?

11:21.098 --> 11:23.058
Yeah, doubt it.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.060
Let's just call in
Agar's Assassins again.

11:25.060 --> 11:29.147
Uh, Agar apparently had his hand
chopped off in a barroom brawl.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.899
[quietly] Oh, shit.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.068
- [high-pitched ringing]
- [grunts]

11:35.237 --> 11:36.947
[Uriel] Very well.

11:36.947 --> 11:38.740
You're hired, Vox Machina.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.909
Mainly because I like the bear.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.620
Lady Allura will accompany you
to the Shale Steps,

11:43.620 --> 11:45.914
the village closest
to the last attack.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.043
So, what exactly are we killing,

11:50.043 --> 11:52.254
and how much are we making?

11:52.254 --> 11:54.172
[Krieg] We don't know
what you're killing,

11:54.172 --> 11:56.466
but once you kill it,
all this is yours.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.720
[Scanlan]
Uh, one more question.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.013
Yeah, how are we supposed
to get there?

12:07.853 --> 12:09.688
[giggles]

12:14.276 --> 12:16.903
[Vex] Brother,
I am telling you I felt it,

12:16.903 --> 12:18.530
right there in the throne room.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.282
I haven't felt that since...

12:20.282 --> 12:21.700
Isn't this ship amazing?

12:21.700 --> 12:23.743
There's two bathrooms
downstairs.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.037
Hey, by the way,
why are you both whispering

12:26.037 --> 12:28.790
- like we can't hear you?
- Can you mind your business
for once, gnome?

12:28.790 --> 12:30.750
[muttering]

12:30.750 --> 12:33.211
As you can see,
the creature has already razed

12:33.211 --> 12:36.590
three villages
and miles of farmland.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.800
If this evil persists,

12:38.800 --> 12:41.803
the kingdom
will starve to death.

12:41.803 --> 12:45.140
This mission sounds
kind of deadly. [chuckles]

12:45.140 --> 12:47.350
- Do we really want to do this?
- Yes, this task

12:47.350 --> 12:51.146
is dangerous, which is why
only the most noble, heroic

12:51.146 --> 12:53.440
- and true...
- Yeah, yeah,
nobility and heroism

12:53.440 --> 12:56.151
is fine and all, but we're
in this for the money.

12:56.151 --> 12:59.821
I see. So it's coin
over character.

12:59.821 --> 13:02.032
Not surprising.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.034
- [wind whistling]
- [wood creaking]

13:11.541 --> 13:12.959
[grunts]

13:12.959 --> 13:15.545
The Shale Steps are beyond
that hill. Good luck.

13:15.545 --> 13:20.217
Please don't, oh,
fuck this up, as they say.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.718
Thanks for the sweet ride.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.720
You'll be back to pick us
up later, right?

13:26.890 --> 13:28.433
[birds cawing]

13:28.433 --> 13:30.602
Yeah, she'll be back.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.153
What we doing here again?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.113
The last attack
was just south of here.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.324
We're gonna ask around,
see if anyone knows anything.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.951
Ask around.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.994
[Keyleth] Excuse me,
green friends.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.164
Have you seen any evil wizards
or giant monsters

13:51.164 --> 13:52.541
passing through here?

13:52.541 --> 13:54.501
- Uh...
- That's kind of weird.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.046
[fisherman] Nah,
it was too foggy.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.840
All we saw was dark clouds,
lightning.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.467
We thought it was a storm.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.844
Oh, you didn't see
anything, huh?

14:04.844 --> 14:09.266
How convenient, Mr. Fisherman,
if that is your real name.

14:09.266 --> 14:12.769
- Whoa...
- Okay, maybe let me
handle the questioning, Scanlan.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.438
I'm sorry about him.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.274
[mother] You're a priest
of sorts, aren't you?

14:17.274 --> 14:19.317
Could you bless our house?

14:19.317 --> 14:20.777
- Protect it from this evil?
- Uh...

14:20.777 --> 14:22.821
A-A blessing?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.614
Uh, no problem.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.825
Okay, here goes.

14:26.825 --> 14:32.372
May the Everlight
shine upon your home.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.457
Everything will be tip-top.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.585
Okay. I'm sure you'll survive
these trying times,

14:36.585 --> 14:39.713
so, good luck?

14:40.839 --> 14:43.550
Are you sure
you're a holy person?

14:43.550 --> 14:45.802
Yeah, I'm-I'm just,
uh, out of practice.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.138
I don't really bless
a lot of houses these days.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.015
Thank you, dear.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.851
I'm sure it'll be enough
to keep our family safe.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.060
[gasps]

14:55.061 --> 14:57.105
Wow.

14:58.607 --> 15:00.525
- Are you a wizard?
- [chuckles]

15:00.525 --> 15:03.278
Nah. The magic's all
in the fingers, kid.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.196
[gasps]

15:05.196 --> 15:06.990
Wow.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.909
And now it's in yours.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.411
Whoa.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.622
That's real silver.
Keep it safe.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.498
There's a monster roaming about.

15:15.498 --> 15:16.875
- You mean flying.
- What's that?

15:16.875 --> 15:18.793
Something flew right over us.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.295
It knocked down
the big tree on the hill.

15:20.295 --> 15:24.424
We heard wings beating but
we couldn't see it in the storm.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.718
But it was big. Really big.

15:26.718 --> 15:27.927
Yeah.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.476
[birds squawking]

15:34.476 --> 15:36.227
[Vex] Get over here.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.480
- Trinket found something.
- [sniffing]

15:40.065 --> 15:42.192
The tracks are too muddy
to discern.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.235
But it looks like
it took to the air

15:44.235 --> 15:45.820
and flew along the coast.

15:48.657 --> 15:50.992
- Whoa. [chuckles]
- [grunts]

15:52.035 --> 15:53.453
Think you'll be needing this.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.080
Ah.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.341
Now they look...

16:06.341 --> 16:07.842
human?

16:11.971 --> 16:14.140
[grunts] It's close.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.767
Everyone, get ready.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.480
[rustling]

16:26.111 --> 16:28.697
[bleats]

16:28.697 --> 16:31.616
[laughs] Get the fuck out.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.619
What, a little lamb
was behind all the mayhem?

16:34.619 --> 16:36.454
Oh, don't let that thing
bite you, Vex.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.456
[grunting]

16:40.875 --> 16:42.794
[bleating]

16:42.794 --> 16:44.462
[beast snarling]

16:50.051 --> 16:51.428
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.389
Fuck!

17:05.817 --> 17:07.694
[shouts]

17:07.694 --> 17:09.863
- [panting]
- [roars]

17:21.166 --> 17:24.002
[grunts, panting]

17:26.337 --> 17:27.839
[booming step]

17:27.839 --> 17:30.592
- I suggest we run. Right now!
- [Grog] Fuck that.

17:31.593 --> 17:32.844
We fight!

17:32.844 --> 17:34.095
[roaring]

17:34.095 --> 17:36.014
Grog, you dumb, brave asshole!

17:37.307 --> 17:38.600
[Grog roaring]

17:38.600 --> 17:41.144
[grunting]

17:43.646 --> 17:46.858
[gasps] Grog's down already?
Come on!

17:49.778 --> 17:51.154
[growls]

17:52.363 --> 17:53.448
[grunting]

17:56.534 --> 17:57.702
[low growl]

18:00.246 --> 18:01.706
[screeches]

18:01.706 --> 18:04.709
Keyleth!
A little magic might help.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.252
[gasping breaths]

18:07.837 --> 18:10.173
- We're in serious trouble here.
- [dragon roars]

18:11.257 --> 18:13.802
Keyleth, snap out of it.
Keyleth!

18:13.802 --> 18:15.804
- Keyleth!
- Sorry. Um...

18:15.804 --> 18:17.096
Okay. Okay.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.601
[whooshing]

18:22.644 --> 18:24.479
[thunder crashing]

18:24.479 --> 18:27.524
[snarls]

18:29.192 --> 18:31.528
[fierce yell]

18:31.528 --> 18:33.655
[thunder crashing, wind rushing]

18:39.035 --> 18:41.663
Did I just make it worse?

18:41.663 --> 18:42.914
[roars]

18:44.082 --> 18:45.959
[shield whirring]

18:45.959 --> 18:47.252
[growling]

18:48.670 --> 18:50.588
[loud rumbling]

18:50.588 --> 18:52.340
- [Vex] Look out!
- [gasping]

18:52.340 --> 18:54.217
[debris settling]

18:56.261 --> 18:58.388
[booming steps]

18:58.388 --> 19:00.765
[sniffing, grunting]

19:00.765 --> 19:02.475
[low growl]

19:04.519 --> 19:06.104
[dragon screeches]

19:07.814 --> 19:11.067
[wingbeats recede in distance]

19:11.067 --> 19:13.278
[Scanlan] Uh, get me out.
Get-get me out!

19:13.278 --> 19:15.947
I'm trapped under Grog's ass!

19:15.947 --> 19:17.740
[straining]

19:17.740 --> 19:19.033
[Percy] So...

19:19.033 --> 19:22.453
this is what rock bottom
feels like.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.207
At least we're still alive,

19:26.207 --> 19:27.834
thank the Everlight.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.795
And thanks to Keyleth
for the giant shrub.

19:30.795 --> 19:34.007
But did you have to make it
so thorny? [groans]

19:34.007 --> 19:37.051
That dragon.
We almost... died.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.219
[pants]

19:38.219 --> 19:40.722
Except we didn't die.
Because of you, Keyleth.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.181
You hear me?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.601
We're alive because of you.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.855
- Grog. You're hurt.
- Nah.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.940
Just a flesh wound. No big.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.735
[groans]
Question: Is this normal?

19:53.735 --> 19:55.820
- Oh, no.
- Holy shit.
- I'm gonna throw up.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.363
Hold still, old friend.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.615
I got you.

19:58.615 --> 19:59.908
[whirring]

20:03.119 --> 20:04.287
[groaning]

20:04.287 --> 20:06.414
Oh, I feel better already.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.875
Thanks, Pike. You're the best.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.461
[sighs]
That... took a lot out of me.

20:11.461 --> 20:12.879
- I got you.
- Oh.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.465
Uh, thanks.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.342
Oh, uh, you can put me down now.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.927
Oh. Yeah.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.553
Uh... yeah.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.473
All right,
fuck Uriel and all of this,

20:23.473 --> 20:25.141
we're done here.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.268
We didn't sign up
for certain death.

20:27.268 --> 20:30.063
Must I remind you
we gave our word to the council?

20:30.063 --> 20:32.440
That should probably
mean something.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.859
Oh, who gives a soggy anus
about the council?

20:34.859 --> 20:38.321
The only word I care about
is "Scanlan Shorthalt."

20:38.321 --> 20:40.281
And yes,
I know that's two words,

20:40.281 --> 20:42.283
but you know what I'm saying.

20:42.283 --> 20:45.203
Yeah. What have those
fuckity-fucks ever done for us?

20:45.203 --> 20:47.455
Except give us a job
and a bunch of gold

20:47.455 --> 20:49.457
and treasure and stuff?

20:49.457 --> 20:51.668
We've fought a lot of things...

20:51.668 --> 20:53.002
but a dragon?

20:53.002 --> 20:54.754
An actual dragon?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.965
It's not about the council,

20:56.965 --> 20:59.175
or the contract...
it's about these people.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.551
They need us.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.804
We can't just run away.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.223
This is why I hate traveling
with holy people.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.600
- They're too goddamned good.
- [Vex] Pike...

21:07.600 --> 21:09.978
this creature is beyond us.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.480
When Vex and I were young,

21:12.480 --> 21:14.607
one of those monsters
killed our mother.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.235
I've studied dragons
my entire life, hoping to find

21:17.235 --> 21:18.403
the one that did it.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.570
I can...

21:19.570 --> 21:21.447
feel when they're close.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.242
A horrid pain in my head.

21:24.242 --> 21:25.743
Then it's settled.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.996
We'll go back to the palace
and get out of the contract.

21:27.996 --> 21:29.789
You don't understand, Percy.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.125
I felt it there, too,
at the palace.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.127
Y-You're just
telling us this now?

21:34.127 --> 21:35.878
I'm sorry. I...

21:35.878 --> 21:38.214
I wasn't certain
until the dragon...

21:38.214 --> 21:40.591
It's been years since Mother...

21:40.591 --> 21:42.218
Are you sure, Vex'ahlia?

21:42.218 --> 21:44.387
I know what I felt.
Someone on the council

21:44.387 --> 21:47.098
