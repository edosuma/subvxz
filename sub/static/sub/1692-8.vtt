01:38.736 --> 01:41.505
<i>( Muffled voices talking )</i>

02:23.413 --> 02:25.314
Well, who was it?

02:25.348 --> 02:28.617
Fella got off on the wrong floor.
He was drunk.

02:28.652 --> 02:31.353
The General Motors convention.

02:31.388 --> 02:34.256
That's it?
There's nobody else out there?

02:36.159 --> 02:39.161
That waiting room's packed
when Nucky's in town.

02:40.763 --> 02:43.999
I don't get it. It's not like
the city's closed for business.

02:44.033 --> 02:47.001
When he's away, I'm in charge.
What's so complicated?

02:47.036 --> 02:50.371
People are funny...
creatures of habit.

02:50.405 --> 02:53.340
They need a favor, they know
Nucky's the man to see.

02:55.777 --> 02:57.912
Get me some coffee.

03:03.719 --> 03:05.453
You don't think
I can do what he does?

03:05.487 --> 03:07.587
The glad-handing,
the backslapping?

03:07.621 --> 03:10.022
I'll buy a nickel joke book
down at the five and dime,

03:10.057 --> 03:12.491
I'll be the toast
of the town myself.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.860
<i>( Knocks )</i>

03:18.798 --> 03:22.133
- Oh.
- Oh what?

03:22.168 --> 03:25.470
I forgot!
Nuck's in Chicago.

03:25.504 --> 03:27.472
And I'm here,
so what do you want?

03:32.978 --> 03:34.545
This Friday

03:34.580 --> 03:37.215
my daughter's being
fitted for her leg braces.

03:37.249 --> 03:39.417
I-I was hoping
to take the day,

03:39.451 --> 03:41.719
have someone else
make my collections.

03:41.753 --> 03:43.788
- Who usually fills in?
- Neary,

03:43.822 --> 03:45.957
but with the indictment,

03:45.991 --> 03:47.825
<i>I got his route now too.</i>

03:47.860 --> 03:49.494
Your kid has polio?

03:51.763 --> 03:54.699
Take the day off.
Be with your girl.

03:54.733 --> 03:56.734
Are you sure?

03:56.768 --> 03:59.703
I just said it, didn't I?
Why would I not be sure?

04:01.039 --> 04:02.839
Thanks.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.750
- Good day, sir.
- Here you go.

04:13.785 --> 04:15.252
Thank you, sir.

04:15.286 --> 04:18.721
My wire specifically requested
the presidential suite.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.659
I'm sorry, sir.
General Wood has also made that request.

04:21.692 --> 04:24.162
- He's jumping the gun a
bit, isn't he? - Sir?

04:24.196 --> 04:26.931
<i>General Wood is only
a candidate for president.</i>

04:26.966 --> 04:28.566
Oh yes, of course.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.602
The ambassador suite is
quite lovely as well, sir.

04:31.636 --> 04:33.336
Fine, then give Wood
the ambassador

04:33.371 --> 04:35.938
- and bring my bags up to the
presidential suite. - Sir, I...

04:35.972 --> 04:38.673
let me tell you the difference
between me and Gerald Wood.

04:38.708 --> 04:41.476
He is a war hero,
former army chief of staff

04:41.510 --> 04:44.847
and practically a shoo-in for the
republican presidential nomination.

04:44.881 --> 04:47.849
I, on the other hand,
am a magnificent tipper.

04:49.185 --> 04:51.218
I'd like a bucket of ice
and three bottles

04:51.253 --> 04:53.387
of Canadian club
waiting in the parlor.

04:55.323 --> 04:58.192
Please make yourself comfortable
while we prepare the suite.

05:09.471 --> 05:12.270
All this empty space, I wonder
where they hide the hootch.

05:12.305 --> 05:13.504
( Chuckles )

05:20.012 --> 05:22.046
Well, if it isn't
Marley's ghost.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.449
Senator edge, whatever
brings you to Chicago?

05:25.484 --> 05:27.318
Oh, I don't know.

05:27.352 --> 05:30.087
I heard the Republicans were
throwing a little shindig,

05:30.121 --> 05:33.423
- thought I'd drop by. - Grab the V.P.
nod while you're here?

05:33.458 --> 05:36.260
I hadn't actually
considered that,

05:36.294 --> 05:38.495
but now that you mention it...

05:38.529 --> 05:41.031
( Chuckles )

05:41.065 --> 05:43.667
How are you, Nuck?
Well, I can't complain,

05:43.701 --> 05:45.535
but that doesn't mean I won't.

05:45.570 --> 05:47.771
I'm wondering if you'd
do me a favor.

05:47.805 --> 05:52.175
Harry Daugherty's hosting a reception
tonight, he asked me to drop by.

05:52.210 --> 05:54.511
Warren Harding's
campaign manager?

05:54.545 --> 05:57.280
- Who cares about harding?
- Well, nobody,

05:57.314 --> 05:59.616
but Daugherty's
a good man to know.

05:59.650 --> 06:03.253
If you'd go on my behalf?
I have a pressing engagement.

06:03.287 --> 06:05.555
Well, don't press on her
too hard, Walter.

06:07.891 --> 06:09.792
You know me well, my friend.

06:09.827 --> 06:12.095
I do indeed.

06:14.631 --> 06:16.966
We're gonna take
this thing, Nucky.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.970
And as soon as we do,
the sky's the limit.

06:21.004 --> 06:23.139
The sky?
I'm only interested

06:23.173 --> 06:25.641
in the roads,
Mr. vice president.

06:27.344 --> 06:31.080
- So you'll see Daugherty?
- You know me... I'll see 'em all.

06:31.949 --> 06:33.849
You're a real pal, Nuck.

06:35.185 --> 06:36.919
- Gentlemen.
- Ah!

06:36.953 --> 06:39.321
The senator seems
in a good humor.

06:39.356 --> 06:41.757
Go check on the room.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.193
<i>( Piano playing )</i>

06:50.733 --> 06:53.936
- Peridot.
- Is that what it's called?

06:53.970 --> 06:55.771
Not emeralds, but not nothing.

06:55.805 --> 06:57.406
Do you think he
picked it himself?

06:57.440 --> 07:00.042
I don't know.

07:00.076 --> 07:03.578
Either he's got better taste in women's
jewelry than a red-blooded man should,

07:03.612 --> 07:07.283
- or someone's doing his shopping for him.
- Mr. Kessler, perhaps.

07:07.318 --> 07:09.152
- The little bochey fellow?
- Mm-hmm.

07:09.186 --> 07:11.721
What's he got hidden
under his woolens?

07:11.755 --> 07:14.190
The kaiser's mustache.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.327
- ( Giggling )
- You are a terrible influence.

07:18.863 --> 07:20.730
Margaret:
How is your Harry?

07:20.764 --> 07:22.432
My Harry's fine.
How's yours?

07:22.466 --> 07:25.935
- ( Giggling ) - We should
get some more cream cakes.

07:25.969 --> 07:29.038
Oh, why not? We can bring
them back for the children.

07:30.541 --> 07:33.543
- Not so bad sometimes, is it?
- What?

07:33.577 --> 07:36.512
The whole ball of wax.

07:39.183 --> 07:41.250
- Margaret.
- Madame Jeunet.

07:41.285 --> 07:44.087
Oh, you must assist me.

07:44.121 --> 07:48.024
- In what?
- Lucy: Where'd you go?!

07:48.058 --> 07:50.159
Ahhh.

07:50.193 --> 07:52.928
( Slurring ) Everybody knows
everybody, isn't that swell?

07:52.963 --> 07:56.232
- Annabelle: How's tricks, Lucy?
- Don't act like you care.

07:56.266 --> 07:59.201
She wishes to make a large
purchase, but her credit...

07:59.236 --> 08:01.437
Mr. Thompson has made clear
that he no longer...

08:01.471 --> 08:04.306
What are you two
whispering about?

08:04.341 --> 08:06.742
Americans don't whisper.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.611
I have asked Margaret
to help me to explain...

08:08.645 --> 08:12.114
Oh, she'll help.
She's very helpful.

08:12.148 --> 08:14.382
Aren't you,
Mrs. MacDougal?

08:14.417 --> 08:18.886
- Schroeder.
- Is that Irish for "bitch"?

08:21.456 --> 08:24.057
You're not at your best now
and you should leave.

08:24.091 --> 08:26.460
Oh, you're in charge
of the lobby now too?

08:26.494 --> 08:29.263
- Lucy.
- My old friend Annabelle.

08:29.298 --> 08:32.333
You wouldn't steer
me wrong, would you?

08:32.368 --> 08:36.105
- No, I wouldn't.
- You're about as phony as that wig.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.741
Miss Danziger,
you must stop now.

08:38.775 --> 08:40.677
You think that
he's your friend?

08:40.711 --> 08:43.614
You think you understand him?

08:43.648 --> 08:45.883
And what if I did?

08:45.917 --> 08:48.652
Then you're the dumbest Dora
I ever met.

08:49.554 --> 08:51.655
( Onlookers gasp )

08:53.792 --> 08:57.061
The next time won't be
nearly as pleasant.

09:15.580 --> 09:17.481
What do you think?

09:17.515 --> 09:20.183
She looks pretty.

09:26.454 --> 09:30.150
The grocery bill...
it's overdue.

09:30.185 --> 09:33.153
<i>- How much is it?
- Nearly $11, dear.</i>

09:33.188 --> 09:36.991
Hello, Tommy.

09:37.025 --> 09:38.625
Did you check the box?

09:38.660 --> 09:40.694
I saw the postman as well.

09:40.728 --> 09:43.597
There was nothing else.

09:51.339 --> 09:53.607
Perhaps it's time
you get a job.

09:53.641 --> 09:57.244
My friend Mary
said the same thing.

09:57.278 --> 10:00.280
Have you considered
selling little dot?

10:00.315 --> 10:03.717
- I'm not sure what that is.
- It's a perfume company.

10:03.751 --> 10:06.153
The ladies who go door to door?

10:06.187 --> 10:09.122
Some of their fragrances
are really quite lovely.

10:09.157 --> 10:12.526
The Violet, Lily of the valley.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.361
I don't think it's for me.

10:14.395 --> 10:16.696
That's right,

10:16.731 --> 10:19.199
you bohemian types
go au naturel.

10:19.233 --> 10:22.169
I've worn perfume.

10:22.203 --> 10:25.172
I was talking about the job.

10:28.843 --> 10:31.044
There's an art dealer
in New York...

10:31.078 --> 10:33.346
Greenwich village...

10:33.381 --> 10:36.549
and he's agreed
to look at my work

10:36.584 --> 10:38.785
<i>with an eye
toward selling it.</i>

10:38.819 --> 10:42.221
- Oh really?
- There are no guarantees, of course.

10:42.256 --> 10:45.658
- But Mary...
- Your friend.

10:47.327 --> 10:50.029
Yes.

10:50.063 --> 10:52.698
She thinks I have
a good chance.

10:54.768 --> 10:57.903
You could take a stenography
course as well, you know.

11:02.409 --> 11:04.610
<i>( Workers chatting )</i>

11:06.713 --> 11:07.913
- Sir?
- Yes?

11:07.948 --> 11:10.082
We got another one.

11:45.417 --> 11:47.085
I haven't confirmed it yet,

11:47.119 --> 11:49.654
but word on the street
is the D.A.

11:49.689 --> 11:52.023
is sniffing around
some of the white sox.

11:53.459 --> 11:56.895
Then he'd be wise to put
a clothespin on his nose.

11:58.797 --> 12:01.132
Any idea which players?

12:03.903 --> 12:05.737
Cicotte and Jackson,
near as I can tell.

12:05.771 --> 12:08.206
Get the farm boys to spill
their milk, is that the idea?

12:08.240 --> 12:12.477
<i>- ( Phone rings ) - Woman: Fallon & McGee.
How may I help you?</i>

12:12.511 --> 12:16.814
It doesn't matter what they
say if Attell won't talk.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.784
Will he?

12:23.255 --> 12:24.722
( Sighs )

12:24.756 --> 12:27.557
He's already been
flapping his gums.

12:28.593 --> 12:30.494
And if the D.A.
pulls him in?

12:30.528 --> 12:32.763
He may be able to take a punch,

12:32.797 --> 12:36.899
but put him in a witness chair and Abe
Attell will fold like hot laundry.

12:39.869 --> 12:41.837
Give it to me again.

12:41.871 --> 12:45.006
"Baseball is
the heart of America.

12:45.041 --> 12:48.176
As a patriot,
I would never do anything

12:48.211 --> 12:50.412
- to degrade our..."
- Besmirch.

12:51.881 --> 12:54.316
It's better.

12:56.985 --> 13:00.120
"... To 'besmirch'
our national pastime.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.859
Ladies and gentlemen,
this entire ugly affair

13:04.893 --> 13:07.463
began when Abe Attell
and some other cheap gamblers

13:07.497 --> 13:09.899
approached me to fix
the world series,

13:09.933 --> 13:12.401
a sordid scheme which
every newsboy on Broadway

13:12.435 --> 13:15.070
knows I turned down flat.

13:15.105 --> 13:17.239
And not only was I
not in on the deal,

13:17.274 --> 13:20.242
I furthermore did not bet
one red cent on the series

13:20.276 --> 13:22.111
after I found out
what was underway."

13:22.145 --> 13:25.716
<i>Isn't it true, sir, that a man named
sport Sullivan approached you as well?</i>

13:27.191 --> 13:28.992
"I'm approached
by people every day

13:29.026 --> 13:31.428
with all manner
of harebrained schemes.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.563
Certainly suffering fools

13:33.597 --> 13:35.899
can't be illegal."

13:35.933 --> 13:38.101
( Chuckles )

13:38.135 --> 13:41.671
You know it's not too late
to go to law school, Arnold.

13:45.843 --> 13:48.911
I prefer to make
my living honestly.

13:51.982 --> 13:54.217
- Never get close to a majority.
- Absolutely.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.853
And with Coolidge on the
ticket, I think he has...

13:56.888 --> 13:58.422
- Sir?
- Nucky Thompson.

13:58.456 --> 14:00.491
I'm looking
for Harry Daugherty.

14:00.525 --> 14:02.426
<i>Right over there.</i>

14:04.729 --> 14:06.563
Mr. Thompson.

14:06.597 --> 14:08.164
Harry Daugherty.

14:08.198 --> 14:09.966
- Call me Nucky.
- Nucky it is.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.301
- What can I get you?
- I wouldn't say no to a bourbon.

14:12.336 --> 14:14.770
( Snaps ) Two double
bourbons on the double.

14:14.805 --> 14:16.939
- Say that 10 times fast.
- ( Chuckles )

14:16.973 --> 14:18.907
Senator edge sends his regrets.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.909
Well, he'll certainly
be missed,

14:20.944 --> 14:23.045
but those in the know say
you're the man to see.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.845
I suppose that depends
on what you want.

14:25.879 --> 14:28.513
"As Nucky Thompson goes,

14:28.548 --> 14:30.883
so goes the New Jersey
delegation."

14:30.917 --> 14:32.618
Well, is it true?

14:32.652 --> 14:35.187
We'll have to wait
and see, now won't we?

14:35.221 --> 14:37.189
That's why
I wanted to meet you.

14:37.223 --> 14:40.792
See, I think Warren harding
could go all the way.

14:40.827 --> 14:43.562
<i>Put edge on that ticket
and we've got a winner.</i>

14:43.597 --> 14:46.432
I like a long shot as much
as the next fella, Harry,

14:46.466 --> 14:48.701
but I'm not quite sure
how you're doping that out.

14:48.735 --> 14:51.070
The front runner's are
Wood and Lowden, right?

14:51.105 --> 14:53.940
That senate inquiry is
a black mark on 'em both.

14:53.974 --> 14:55.975
- The campaign finance.
- Then there's Johnson,

14:56.009 --> 14:58.310
who started the damn
investigation to begin with,

14:58.345 --> 15:00.212
which didn't exactly
win him any friends.

15:00.247 --> 15:04.050
The field has no first-raters and
Harding's the best of the second-raters.

15:04.084 --> 15:07.953
Not exactly a rousing endorsement,
but it happens to be true.

15:07.988 --> 15:09.755
<i>He certainly
looks like a president.</i>

15:09.790 --> 15:11.957
That's half the battle,
my friend.

15:11.992 --> 15:14.359
More than half if those
trollops get the vote.

15:14.394 --> 15:16.895
- Great meal last night, Harry.
- Do the right thing, boys,

15:16.930 --> 15:20.732
- and steak won't be the only thing on the menu.
- You bet, Harry.

15:21.934 --> 15:24.035
I have quite an appetite
myself, you know?

15:26.071 --> 15:28.706
You should meet Warren.
You're gonna like him.

15:34.981 --> 15:38.116
<i>- ( Baby fusses ) - Woman: Mr.
Smith... he invited me.</i>

15:38.150 --> 15:41.052
- My name should be on the list.
- Miss Britton, go to your room.

15:41.086 --> 15:44.388
- I'll make sure he knows... - Jess, would
you please just tell Warren that I'm here.

15:44.422 --> 15:47.591
Senator and Mrs. harding, I'd
like you to meet Nucky Thompson,

15:47.626 --> 15:49.927
an esteemed member of
the New Jersey delegation.

15:49.962 --> 15:51.996
- How do you do?
- An honor and a privilege.

15:52.030 --> 15:54.465
Senator, I read a speech
you gave back in may

15:54.499 --> 15:56.166
in Rhode island, I believe.

15:56.201 --> 15:59.002
- "Back to normal.
" - Boston, at the home market club.

15:59.037 --> 16:01.237
- Right.
- It was quite something.

16:01.272 --> 16:03.039
- Very well done.
- That's nothing.

16:03.073 --> 16:06.175
I can spend hours bloviating.

16:06.210 --> 16:08.811
You see, Americans don't want

16:08.846 --> 16:10.847
someone looking
to stir things up.

16:10.881 --> 16:13.082
They want stability,
someone dedicated

16:13.116 --> 16:15.151
to safeguarding
America first...

16:15.185 --> 16:19.221
<i>- ( Baby fusses ) - ...To prosper America
first, to think of America first.</i>

16:19.256 --> 16:21.757
My best judgment for
what America needs now

16:21.792 --> 16:24.326
is to steady down, to get
squarely on our feet...

16:24.361 --> 16:27.096
Warren, there's a few other
gentlemen I'd like you to meet.

16:27.130 --> 16:30.132
Nucky, I hope you'll
consider what we discussed.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.767
A pleasure.

16:34.905 --> 16:37.540
You must be awfully
proud of your husband.

16:37.574 --> 16:40.176
It's a terrible wretched thing.

16:41.678 --> 16:44.447
A fortune-teller told me
he'll die in office.

16:50.921 --> 16:53.423
Thank you, miss Britton.

16:54.691 --> 16:56.559
<i>( Bell rings )</i>

16:57.929 --> 17:00.297

17:14.113 --> 17:16.513

- Good evening.

17:18.217 --> 17:20.951
- Beautiful child.
- Oh, thank you.

17:20.986 --> 17:23.420
A young republican,
I'm guessing.

17:23.454 --> 17:25.321
She certainly is.

17:25.356 --> 17:28.324
- And what brings you to
the convention? - Oh...

17:28.358 --> 17:31.761
We're, um, friends
of Mr. Harding's.

17:34.030 --> 17:36.931
Well, it's good to have
friends in politics.

17:39.701 --> 17:41.436
Do you have children yourself?

17:43.172 --> 17:44.639
No.

17:44.673 --> 17:47.041
I had a son.

17:47.076 --> 17:48.943
He died.

17:49.845 --> 17:51.879
I'm sorry.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.596
Bless this food, o lord,

18:09.630 --> 18:12.933
and ourselves
to thy loving service;

18:12.967 --> 18:15.936
That we may always
continue in thy faith

18:15.970 --> 18:19.039
and fear to the honor
and glory of thy name,

18:19.074 --> 18:22.575
through Jesus Christ our lord.

18:22.610 --> 18:24.646
- Amen.
- Amen.

18:30.020 --> 18:32.355
The garden...

18:32.389 --> 18:35.158
The tulips are looking
a little ragged.

18:39.663 --> 18:42.131
- ( Sniffles )
- What's wrong?

18:43.666 --> 18:46.034
<i>( Sighs )</i>

18:47.937 --> 18:50.171
You put yourself
through this every month.

18:50.206 --> 18:52.207
( Sniffles )

18:52.241 --> 18:55.844
It means I'm not fully a woman.

18:55.878 --> 18:57.679
<i>- Yes, you are, very much so.
- No.</i>

18:57.713 --> 19:01.416
No. No baby
will grow inside me.

19:03.252 --> 19:05.520
And in the place of that joy,

19:05.554 --> 19:08.723
every 28 days the blood flows

19:08.757 --> 19:10.758
<i>and then I can't help it,
so do the tears.</i>

19:10.793 --> 19:12.493
Please eat.

19:29.578 --> 19:34.115
I, uh, ran into Naomi
Ellsworth at the milliner.

19:34.149 --> 19:35.883
Mmm.

19:35.917 --> 19:38.653
She said I might be able
to get some help.

19:38.687 --> 19:42.056
Must everyone know
our private affairs?

19:42.091 --> 19:44.359
She had difficulty
conceiving herself.

19:44.393 --> 19:46.794
There was a... a blockage
in her tubes as well.

19:46.829 --> 19:49.897
Why must we always
go on about this?

19:49.931 --> 19:51.565
If the lord wanted us...

19:51.599 --> 19:53.500
if the lord wanted us
to die of appendicitis

19:53.535 --> 19:56.671
then he wouldn't have given
us the ability to treat it.

20:01.176 --> 20:04.179
That's Naomi Ellsworth talking.

20:04.213 --> 20:07.148
I want to get this fixed.

20:09.618 --> 20:12.420
There's a physician in Manhattan.

20:12.454 --> 20:15.523
- He can perform a surgery.
- Surgery?!

20:15.557 --> 20:17.658
It's $270.

20:17.693 --> 20:21.062
My salary barely meets
expenses as it is.

20:23.565 --> 20:26.200
I want to give you
a son, Nelson.

20:29.771 --> 20:32.039
( Sobbing )

20:43.018 --> 20:45.920
All I want is for you
to be happy, rose.

20:49.157 --> 20:51.258
I'll do what I can.

20:55.163 --> 20:58.097
Now please, dear, eat.

21:02.568 --> 21:05.503
<i>( Clicking )</i>

<i>- Look at that.
- I'll tell you,</i>

21:16.815 --> 21:20.251
if they had nuns like that, I might
have made it past sixth grade.

21:20.286 --> 21:22.688
I don't think anything could have
got you past the sixth grade, Jim.

21:22.722 --> 21:24.389
<i>- ( Laughter )
- What's this now?</i>

21:24.424 --> 21:26.359
<i>- Oh boy.
- It's called a snatch, Al.</i>

21:26.393 --> 21:28.794
What's that smell like
on a hot summer day?

21:30.764 --> 21:32.565
Jesus, where do they
get these women?

21:32.600 --> 21:35.102
If I find out, I'm sure as
hell keeping it to myself.

21:35.136 --> 21:38.238
- Ah. Sorry, boys.
- God damn it.

21:38.273 --> 21:40.741
- Come on!
- It was just getting good.

21:42.043 --> 21:43.743
<i>- There we go.
- Back in business.</i>

21:43.777 --> 21:46.780
<i>- All right! - So are we all
straight on the collections?</i>

21:46.814 --> 21:48.949
Yeah, I'll take the inlet

Fleming will take
the other side.

- Are you sure?

21:58.359 --> 21:59.626
Yeah.

21:59.660 --> 22:01.261
June and I have an affair...

22:01.295 --> 22:03.663

Standard operating procedure.
It's a new world.

If he could talk, I'm sure
Charlie Sheridan would agree.

23:25.576 --> 23:27.143
You read about that, huh?

23:27.178 --> 23:29.746
Your boy Jimmy?
My boy.

You just can't make
your point, huh?

23:37.555 --> 23:39.689
Well, where the fuck
is it already?

23:39.723 --> 23:42.292
McCoy's sailing up
from Bimini as we speak.

23:42.326 --> 23:44.427
On a raft?
I need delivery.

24:05.816 --> 24:07.216
Salut.

24:10.887 --> 24:14.423
So let me ask you, any scuttlebutt
on this Harry Daugherty?

24:14.457 --> 24:17.726
- Never heard of him.
- He's Warren Harding's campaign manager.

24:17.761 --> 24:19.962
- Never heard of him neither.
- He's a senator from Ohio.

24:19.996 --> 24:22.464
- He's running for president.
- Why didn't you say so?

24:22.499 --> 24:25.401
Ohio? You should
talk to judge Graves.

24:25.435 --> 24:28.403
- Who's he? - See?
You don't know everybody.

24:28.438 --> 24:31.072
Your honor!

24:34.010 --> 24:36.311
I want to introduce you
to a dear friend of mine...

24:36.345 --> 24:38.413
<i>Nucky Thompson

24:38.447 --> 24:40.649
- How do you do?
- Oh, I've never been to Jersey.

24:40.683 --> 24:43.318
Staten island once,
but that was years ago.

24:43.352 --> 24:45.987
Well, you're welcome any time.
At my expense, of course.

24:46.022 --> 24:48.857
- Much obliged.
- Here.

24:53.362 --> 24:56.164
So I hear you have some
insight into Warren harding.

24:56.198 --> 24:59.901
Harding? He's a puppet for the
fast-money boys in Cleveland.

24:59.935 --> 25:02.403
I used to sit
on the bench there.

25:02.438 --> 25:05.740
- You like his chances? - I like them
better with Harry Daugherty behind him.

25:05.774 --> 25:08.610
- A little cagey, that one.
- But he knows how to treat a friend,

25:08.644 --> 25:10.745
I can tell you that
from experience.

25:10.779 --> 25:13.815
These Ohio fellas know what
they're doing, Mr. Thompson.

25:13.849 --> 25:15.917

26:14.675 --> 26:17.510
I've been coming to Chicago

Sure, why not?

Your family as well.

26:57.018 --> 27:00.454
- How are they?
- Why don't you call and find out?

27:00.488 --> 27:03.557
I write her every week, Nuck.
She never writes me back.

a new wristwatch for yourself?

No. Margaret,
there's been an incident.

30:01.698 --> 30:04.166
My brother's been shot.

30:04.201 --> 30:07.003
Oh my God, is he dead?

30:07.037 --> 30:09.005
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

30:09.039 --> 30:12.375
<i>- I need you to do something for me.
- I'll go to him immediately.</i>

30:12.409 --> 30:14.644
Uh, but I'll need
to call a sitter.

30:14.678 --> 30:16.445
No. Actually,
it's my office.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.414
<i>Yes?</i>

30:18.448 --> 30:21.283
Eli's being cared for.
He's home with his family.

30:21.318 --> 30:23.252
There's a doctor.

30:23.286 --> 30:24.987
I need you to go to the Ritz.

30:25.021 --> 30:28.791
<i>- Very well. - My office...
it's been left unattended.</i>

30:28.825 --> 30:31.927
<i>I'll need you to safeguard
a few things,</i>

30:31.962 --> 30:34.062
<i>some business records.</i>

30:35.398 --> 30:37.466
What about Mr. Fleming

30:37.500 --> 30:39.134
<i>or one of your aldermen?</i>

30:39.168 --> 30:40.902
I don't know what's
happening right now

30:40.937 --> 30:44.639
and until I return I prefer
to rely only on you.

30:44.674 --> 30:46.575
Can I do that?

30:46.609 --> 30:48.243
Yes.

30:48.277 --> 30:50.545
Yes, of course.

30:50.580 --> 30:54.282
<i>In the top drawer of my desk
is a ledger book.</i>

30:54.317 --> 30:57.852
I want you to take it out, leave it
closed and bring it to my closet.

30:57.887 --> 31:01.289
In the back, behind the shoe
rack, is a compartment.

31:01.324 --> 31:05.860
Slip it in there and stay in the suite
with your children until I return.

31:07.229 --> 31:08.997
When will that be?

31:09.031 --> 31:11.633
<i>I'm on the first
train home tomorrow.</i>

31:13.669 --> 31:16.204
Are you all right?

31:20.342 --> 31:22.343
I don't know.

31:34.656 --> 31:36.757
( Ticking )

31:41.863 --> 31:44.131
<i>( Door closes )</i>

31:50.538 --> 31:52.706
What are you drinking?

31:54.442 --> 31:55.709
Whiskey.

31:55.743 --> 31:58.412
I figured only champagne
now with that get-up.

32:01.483 --> 32:03.484
It's bespoke.

32:03.518 --> 32:06.187
Al bought it for me.

32:07.656 --> 32:09.823
Who's your friend?

32:09.858 --> 32:12.125
War buddy.

32:13.594 --> 32:16.863
Richard harrow.

32:18.433 --> 32:20.200
To the lost.

32:25.907 --> 32:29.009
So I'm assuming
this is not a social call.

32:30.278 --> 32:32.946
I need you to come home, James.

32:32.981 --> 32:35.749
Need or want?

32:35.784 --> 32:39.219
Eli's been shot.
They robbed Lolly's.

32:39.254 --> 32:41.355
- Who did?
- I don't know.

32:41.389 --> 32:43.390
We're at war, kid.

32:43.425 --> 32:45.993
They hit Chalky's
a few months back,

32:46.027 --> 32:47.561
killed one of his men,

32:47.595 --> 32:50.164
robbed O'Neill right out
in the open on the boards.

32:50.198 --> 32:52.699
- And now this?
- Someone's got it in their head

32:52.734 --> 32:56.470
that I'm weak, that I have no
real means of retaliation.

32:56.504 --> 32:59.306
You got the whole sheriff's
department on your payroll.

32:59.340 --> 33:01.641
And the sheriff in bed
with a bullet in his gut.

33:01.676 --> 33:05.612
There are things I may require that I'm
uncomfortable asking of Eli anyway,

33:05.646 --> 33:08.048
particularly with
the election coming.

33:16.057 --> 33:17.924
This afternoon when you saw me,

33:17.959 --> 33:21.161
you looked at me like I was something
you scraped off your boot.

33:21.196 --> 33:23.730
Now it's 4:00 in the morning,
the world's closing in,

33:23.765 --> 33:26.967
- I'm your long lost son?
- Don't overestimate yourself, James.

33:27.001 --> 33:30.170
Why shouldn't I, Nuck?
I'm doing very well here.

33:30.204 --> 33:32.172
And how far will that go?

33:32.206 --> 33:34.107
You're Irish, Torrio's Italian.

33:34.141 --> 33:36.276
You'll always be an outsider.

33:40.681 --> 33:43.149
You know this suit
cost 70 bucks?

33:45.186 --> 33:48.254
You're about as subtle as a kick
in the teeth, you know that?

33:56.363 --> 33:58.631
5% of anything
that comes in by boat

33:58.665 --> 34:02.001
and 10% of anything
that comes in on wheels.

34:02.035 --> 34:04.303
And that fed?

34:04.338 --> 34:07.073
What do I do about him?

34:07.107 --> 34:09.842
I'll work that out.

34:12.078 --> 34:14.545
I got to think about it.

34:19.552 --> 34:21.219
You do that,

34:21.254 --> 34:23.088
but whatever you decide,

34:23.123 --> 34:25.623
don't ever keep me
waiting again.

35:28.520 --> 35:31.622
<i>( Wind blowing )</i>

35:52.243 --> 35:54.544
( Phone rings )

36:01.452 --> 36:03.720
Hello?

36:06.891 --> 36:09.726
Hello.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.829
This is Mrs. Schroeder.

36:12.864 --> 36:15.498
Who is this?

36:17.802 --> 36:19.803
<i>( Line clicks )</i>

36:34.117 --> 36:37.153
Well.
This is rather clandestine.

36:37.187 --> 36:39.856
Something tells me you're no
stranger to backroom meetings.

36:39.890 --> 36:42.258
( Chuckles ) Quite a back room.

36:42.292 --> 36:44.794
I need to head home.
Something came up.

36:44.828 --> 36:47.062
Before the convention
even starts?

36:47.097 --> 36:48.731
I've made inquiries, Harry.

36:48.765 --> 36:50.799
Heard good things about
you from judge Graves.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.734
You mean you heard I play ball.

36:52.769 --> 36:54.903
Well, don't you?

36:54.937 --> 36:57.506
The babe's got nothing
on Harry Daugherty.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.474
I've thought about
what you said.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.410
It's slim, but harding
has a chance.

37:01.444 --> 37:03.378
I thought
you were backing Wood.

37:03.413 --> 37:05.313
I think he'll
deadlock with Lowden.

37:05.348 --> 37:08.383
- And if that happens, they're both done.
- Delegates won't cross over.

37:08.417 --> 37:11.953
Don't expect harding to be nominated early,
but come the fifth or sixth ballot?

37:11.988 --> 37:15.523
Those bleary-eyed delegates will want to
nominate somebody who could actually win.

37:15.557 --> 37:17.492
If that happens,
I'm prepared to throw

37:17.526 --> 37:19.360
the Jersey delegation
behind harding.

37:19.394 --> 37:21.061
In exchange for edge
getting v.P.

37:21.096 --> 37:24.498
<i>In exchange for edge
not getting v.P.</i>

37:26.501 --> 37:27.835
What am I missing here?

37:27.869 --> 37:30.204
That Walter edge is a dirty
backstabbing chiseler

37:30.238 --> 37:32.206
who gave my road money
to Frank Hague.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.674
How do you know that?

37:33.708 --> 37:36.510
Because Hague's an even
bigger backstabbing chiseler,

37:36.544 --> 37:38.812
not to mention a friend.

37:38.847 --> 37:41.181
( Laughing )

37:41.215 --> 37:42.883
That's rich, boy.
I'll tell ya.

37:42.917 --> 37:45.219
You can tell me something
else while you're at it.

37:45.254 --> 37:47.788
Like how you propose to take
care of Harding's lady trouble.

37:47.823 --> 37:50.491
( Sighs ) Which lady?
Which trouble?

37:50.526 --> 37:53.160
- There are more than one?
- Showgirls, shopgirls,

37:53.195 --> 37:55.596
I've lost count,
to tell you the truth.

37:55.631 --> 37:57.898
One of them's even
blackmailing him.

37:57.933 --> 38:00.001
The skirt with the little girl?

38:00.035 --> 38:02.336
Naw, she's okay.
She's in love is all.

38:02.370 --> 38:05.172
- Name's Nan Britton.
- And the baby's his?

38:06.508 --> 38:08.342
It could cost him the election.

38:09.678 --> 38:12.079
Then let me help.
I'll bring her to a.C.,

38:12.113 --> 38:15.316
put her up till November.
I've got a lady-friend with kids of her own,

38:15.350 --> 38:18.786
they'll look in on her.
After the election, she's your problem again.

38:18.820 --> 38:21.588
And then I get my road money.

38:22.857 --> 38:25.359
I'll have to sell it to Warren.

38:25.393 --> 38:27.961
I'm sure you're quite
the salesman.

38:31.566 --> 38:34.301
You know Al Jolson agreed
to write his campaign song.

38:34.335 --> 38:36.403
Eddie cantor's better.

38:43.612 --> 38:46.047
Love to hear from you.

38:46.081 --> 38:48.315
I'm just surprised, that's all.

38:48.349 --> 38:50.684
What, a fella can't call
his mother once in a while?

38:50.718 --> 38:53.687
<i>You can call me
twice a day if you like.</i>

38:53.721 --> 38:58.425
I saw Nucky.
He was o here for the convention.

38:58.459 --> 39:01.228
I'm assuming you've heard
what happened to his brother.

39:01.262 --> 39:03.563
Yeah, that was something, huh?

39:03.598 --> 39:07.434
<i>I swear, this world is going
to hell in a handbasket.</i>

39:07.468 --> 39:10.670
Yeah.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.775
You sound lonesome, baby.

39:17.045 --> 39:19.313
I was thinking of you.

39:19.347 --> 39:21.148
<i>Are you eating?</i>

39:22.717 --> 39:24.584
Yeah, of course.

39:25.887 --> 39:28.121
Why don't you come home,
honeypot?

39:29.723 --> 39:31.958
I don't know.

39:35.796 --> 39:39.833
So what can you tell me
about this Luciano fella?

39:39.867 --> 39:42.002
Well...

39:42.036 --> 39:45.071
Where do I begin?

39:47.174 --> 39:49.843
Yeah, those two.
This way, miss Britton.

39:55.649 --> 39:57.818
Nucky!

39:59.888 --> 40:02.123
I got your message.
Where are you going?

40:02.157 --> 40:05.192
- Home. - But the delegates
haven't voted yet.

40:05.226 --> 40:07.294
Who's gonna get
all our ducks in a row?

40:07.328 --> 40:09.929
- Why don't you ask Frank Hague?
- Hague?

40:09.963 --> 40:12.097
What's this all about?

40:12.132 --> 40:15.301
We've known each other a long time,
Wally, so why don't you cut the crap?

40:16.269 --> 40:18.003
"Wally"?

40:18.038 --> 40:20.306
You're speaking to a
United States senator.

40:20.340 --> 40:21.874
And that's all you'll ever be.

40:21.908 --> 40:24.243
You made a deal with Hague
to fuck me over.

40:24.277 --> 40:27.713
- Nucky, I have no idea what you're
talking about... - Don't insult me.

40:31.151 --> 40:33.419
It was just politics.

40:33.453 --> 40:35.554
I'll make it up to you later.

40:35.588 --> 40:37.723
Later when?

40:37.757 --> 40:39.691
When I'm in the white house.

40:39.726 --> 40:43.195
Senator, the only chance you
have of entering the white house

40:43.229 --> 40:46.231
is on a guided fucking tour.

40:50.571 --> 40:53.006
( Speaking Italian )

40:59.245 --> 41:01.746
( Laughing )

41:21.100 --> 41:23.468

continuing )</i>

I love your breasts,</i>

42:43.044 --> 42:46.012
daring to feel
where my face rests.

42:46.047 --> 42:49.516
I love your skin
so soft and white,

42:49.551 --> 42:54.221
so dear to feel
and sweet to bite.

42:55.523 --> 42:57.624
<i>I love your knees,

42:57.659 --> 43:00.093

I love your poise
of perfect thighs,

43:04.432 --> 43:07.000
the way they hold me
in paradise."

43:08.302 --> 43:11.304
That was the first love
poem Warren ever wrote me.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.674
He's got quite
a way with words.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.447
We'll be making a coal stop
in 30 minutes, folks.

43:20.481 --> 43:22.616
I'm going to freshen up.

43:25.319 --> 43:28.054
<i>- Anything out of Chicago?
- Just came over the wires.</i>

43:28.089 --> 43:31.257
Warren harding received the
nomination after 10 ballots.

43:35.729 --> 43:37.730
That imbecile

43:37.765 --> 43:40.733
is going to be the next
President of the United States.

44:04.423 --> 44:06.624

Oh my God.

Everything's going to be fine.

45:36.581 --> 45:38.882
It might take awhile,

45:38.917 --> 45:41.318
but we'll get him
back on his feet.

45:41.352 --> 45:43.787
Give us a minute, will you?

45:58.002 --> 46:00.136
How are you doing,
little brother?

46:01.505 --> 46:04.174
( Weakly )
They came out of nowhere.

46:06.477 --> 46:08.411
Nothing I could do.

46:13.117 --> 46:16.386
It's only money, forget it.

46:16.421 --> 46:19.622
It's more than money.

46:21.725 --> 46:24.159
We're under siege.

46:28.698 --> 46:31.233
I asked Jimmy to come back.

46:32.335 --> 46:34.270
Jimmy?

46:34.304 --> 46:37.239
We need help, Eli.

46:41.311 --> 46:45.014
How many years
have we been doing this?

46:45.048 --> 46:48.517
Not once has this
ever happened.

46:51.655 --> 46:54.156
It's a new world.
