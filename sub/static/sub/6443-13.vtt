You guys okay? You want a cracker
to help you put down?

00:40.188 --> 00:42.278
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

00:42.828 --> 00:44.155
Drink.

01:04.644 --> 01:05.843
Oh!

01:10.517 --> 01:11.872
Now, do you believe me?

01:11.890 --> 01:13.850
This isn't Suzy sorority
you're playing with.

01:13.854 --> 01:18.454
I've drunk vodka with Russian generals,
black and tans with British battalion troops...

01:18.460 --> 01:20.095
stop talking.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.124
Start drinking.

01:32.564 --> 01:34.497
What are you doing, man?

01:34.937 --> 01:36.326
I'm drinking.

01:36.327 --> 01:38.377
We've got physicals coming up.

01:38.937 --> 01:41.099
Ask me if I give a rat's ass.

01:41.100 --> 01:45.134
Stop stalling, and let's go.
Drink up, or pay up.

01:45.135 --> 01:47.682
All right, let's get everybody
out of here, all right?

01:47.683 --> 01:49.545
I got to wake up
brutally early tomorrow.

01:49.555 --> 01:51.234
The recruit's coming.

01:55.957 --> 01:58.165
Dude, you've had enough.

01:58.166 --> 02:01.944
I'm not even tipsy.

02:21.393 --> 02:23.827
Come on, let's get you into bed.

02:30.774 --> 02:32.481
Deep breaths...

02:32.482 --> 02:35.092
fresh air. The world is not spinning.

02:35.093 --> 02:37.273
Hey, wait up.

02:39.010 --> 02:41.686
Shouldn't you be in pink
elephant land right about now?

02:41.687 --> 02:43.683
I got another game for you.

02:43.684 --> 02:46.372
Only this time, we both win.

02:46.529 --> 02:48.904
Come on, give me some.

02:48.905 --> 02:52.474
I've got a game for you, football.
It's called hide-and-go seek.

02:52.475 --> 02:55.118
You go hide, and I'll count to a billion.

02:55.119 --> 02:57.351
Ready, set, go.

02:58.550 --> 03:00.857
Aw, come on!
Don't be like that!

03:00.858 --> 03:03.635
You got a girlfriend,
bonehead. Go bug her.

03:03.636 --> 03:04.849
Come on!

03:08.546 --> 03:11.925
Now, don't you think hide-and-seek
would've been a little more fun?

03:11.926 --> 03:13.913
That hurt.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.849
Night-night, party boy.

03:35.860 --> 03:38.186
Go away.

03:38.187 --> 03:40.411
Please, god...

03:47.486 --> 03:50.035
Whoever is pounding
on a dorm room door

03:50.055 --> 03:52.227
at 7:00 in the morning...

03:52.242 --> 03:54.046
Lois Lane?

03:54.047 --> 03:55.337
Do you mind not talking so loud?

03:55.345 --> 03:57.990
There's been a report that you had
an altercation last night with Dave Cooper.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.815
If "altercation" is defined as "jock attacks,
and I knock the wind out of him," yeah, I confess.

04:02.835 --> 04:06.850
The boy is paralyzed.
You're under arrest.

Season 4 Episode 13

05:03.035 --> 05:05.035
Original Airdate Feb. 9, 2005

05:05.823 --> 05:07.955
I realize I already gave
you my blessing on this,

05:07.965 --> 05:09.710
Clark, and I don't want to lie to you.

05:09.747 --> 05:12.012
This whole thing
makes me feel uneasy.

05:12.015 --> 05:13.296
Dad, we've been
watching Met U.

05:13.322 --> 05:14.778
Football games since
I can remember.

05:14.779 --> 05:16.086
Now they're knocking on my door.

05:16.087 --> 05:18.546
I know that, and I'm proud of you for it.

05:18.547 --> 05:20.095
Then why can't I
have a shot at what

05:20.121 --> 05:21.706
every other high
school kid dreams of?

05:21.727 --> 05:24.036
Because you're not like every
other high school kid, Clark.

05:24.037 --> 05:25.375
On that field I am.

05:25.376 --> 05:27.283
I'm not even using my abilities...
and I can be the

05:27.309 --> 05:29.263
new starting quarterback for
the Metropolis Bulldogs.

05:29.264 --> 05:30.937
There's gonna be
millions of eyes on you.

05:30.945 --> 05:32.407
You're gonna be under
a magnifying glass.

05:32.411 --> 05:34.000
I have pulled it off before.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.020
Clark,

05:36.511 --> 05:39.207
Met U. Is not like Smallville high.

05:39.208 --> 05:42.253
It's a much bigger stage.
There's gonna be much bigger problems.

05:42.254 --> 05:46.143
You always told me not to walk away
from something just because it's a challenge.

05:47.966 --> 05:49.639
Dad, I can do this.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.071
I know that you can handle it.

05:53.009 --> 05:57.242
I also know you'll behave yourself this weekend...
stay clear of the beer kegs.

05:57.243 --> 05:59.264
Don't worry. Alcohol can't
affect me, remember?

05:59.340 --> 06:02.134
That's not the point.
You're still underage.

06:04.947 --> 06:08.332
Look, son, I just don't want you
to get booted out before you get in.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.620
- All right?
- Okay.

06:09.621 --> 06:11.194
Now, there's one more thing.

06:11.195 --> 06:13.408
It's very important.

06:13.571 --> 06:16.212
This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

06:16.338 --> 06:17.954
Have a great time.

06:18.748 --> 06:20.277
Clark Kent...

06:20.622 --> 06:23.281
future Met. U. Hall-of-famer?

06:24.426 --> 06:25.868
Hey.

06:26.351 --> 06:28.717
What's the Teflon tailback
doing back in town?

06:28.718 --> 06:30.212
Hey, Mr. Kent.

06:30.241 --> 06:32.605
Coach Calloway wanted to surprise Clark,

06:32.606 --> 06:34.646
send a local boy to pick him up.

06:34.655 --> 06:37.165
Well, it definitely worked. I
would've never expected to see

06:37.169 --> 06:39.690
the Bulldogs' All-Time
leading rusher in my barn.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.366
Hey, I'm no different than you, Clark. I'm just...

06:42.367 --> 06:44.729
a farm boy who happens
to be a decent football player.

06:44.730 --> 06:46.357
"Decent football player".

06:46.358 --> 06:48.288
You're on your way to
the NFL, and you're

06:48.314 --> 06:49.989
quite the legend at
Smallville high.

06:49.990 --> 06:53.977
Yeah, well, your boy broke my record
for single season T.D.S.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.631
Yeah...

06:55.970 --> 06:57.903
You got what it takes, Clark.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.693
You really think so?

07:00.694 --> 07:02.434
I know so.

07:02.786 --> 07:04.422
You got a heck of a
ride a head of you, but

07:04.448 --> 07:06.096
the thing that's gonna
keep you level-headed

07:06.100 --> 07:08.719
is remembering where you come from...

07:08.976 --> 07:11.138
like Smallville high.

07:11.537 --> 07:13.427
You wanna go say hi to coach Quigley?

07:13.428 --> 07:14.535
Sure.

07:21.616 --> 07:23.424
He was no prince charming, but

07:23.450 --> 07:25.231
nobody deserves to have
that happen to them.

07:25.232 --> 07:27.942
He can't even speak.
I feel terrible.

07:27.943 --> 07:30.353
Lois, it doesn't take an M.D.
to know that a kick to

07:30.360 --> 07:33.104
to the gut is not gonna cause
head-to-toe paralysis.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.036
I hope the judge agrees.
Otherwise, I'm gonna be the star

07:36.040 --> 07:37.965
of my very own
woman in prison movie.

07:37.970 --> 07:39.743
How did you post bail?

07:39.744 --> 07:41.329
Four very good
friends of mine...

07:41.335 --> 07:44.120
Visa, MasterCard, American
Express, and Discover.

07:44.636 --> 07:46.911
Chloe, I didn't know where else to go.

07:46.912 --> 07:50.598
And lucky for you, I'm on my way to Met U.
For my financial aid pitch.

07:50.599 --> 07:53.795
Why don't we just, um, round-trip together,
and we'll figure this thing out?

07:53.796 --> 07:55.753
Lois, I heard what happened.

07:55.754 --> 07:57.950
I see news travels fast.

07:57.951 --> 08:00.126
The guy you put in the hospital

08:00.127 --> 08:01.708
is Geoff's roommate.

08:01.734 --> 08:04.222
Clark, I swear to god,
all I did was knock the

08:04.248 --> 08:06.762
wind out of him. I couldn't
have paralyzed him.

08:06.763 --> 08:08.486
You were drinking, right?

08:08.487 --> 08:10.292
Those days are over.
No more alcohol.

08:10.298 --> 08:13.183
And that includes cough
syrup and rum cakes.

08:15.148 --> 08:16.823
Aspirin, anyone?

08:16.910 --> 08:20.003
"Torch" desk drawer on the left-hand side.

08:22.417 --> 08:24.827
Listen, Chloe, I know that we
were supposed to drive to Met U.

08:24.845 --> 08:26.015
Today, but since Geoff is here,

08:26.017 --> 08:28.949
I understand. Star quarterback...

08:28.955 --> 08:30.630
you don't wanna ride
with the common folk.

08:30.636 --> 08:32.051
You know it's not like that.

08:32.058 --> 08:33.131
It's fine, Clark.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.946
Hey, uh, Clark,

08:35.947 --> 08:39.339
I'm actually kind of surprised
that you took the football route.

08:40.366 --> 08:41.772
Why?

08:41.822 --> 08:42.981
Well...

08:43.486 --> 08:47.230
I don't know, it just seems like you have kind of
an unfair advantage.

08:50.626 --> 08:52.067
What do you mean?

08:52.333 --> 08:55.479
Well, you have all of
these truly amazing talents,

08:55.480 --> 08:58.449
um, you know, on the field...

08:59.500 --> 09:00.852
well, you know, that's
the way it is in sports.

09:00.855 --> 09:02.843
Some people are better than others.

09:04.865 --> 09:06.271
Right.

09:06.639 --> 09:10.352
I guess I just don't understand
as much as I thought I did.

09:11.648 --> 09:13.300
About football.

09:13.506 --> 09:15.176
Chloe...

09:15.481 --> 09:19.201
let's go, C.K.
The festivities are about to begin.

09:29.635 --> 09:32.027
I take it you've contemplated my job offer.

09:32.028 --> 09:33.909
It wasn't a hard decision to make.

09:34.388 --> 09:36.993
I forgot to mention, a
company car is included

09:37.000 --> 09:38.665
as well as a generous
expense account.

09:38.672 --> 09:40.362
I'm not gonna work for
somebody whose mission

09:40.368 --> 09:42.340
it is to break me and
my girlfriend up.

09:44.387 --> 09:45.687
Jason...

09:46.429 --> 09:49.803
my only concern is Lana's welfare.

09:51.405 --> 09:53.988
But you're not the threat
I'm worried about.

09:54.869 --> 09:56.619
It's your mother.

09:58.126 --> 10:01.793
Did you ever find it strange
that every summer as a child

10:01.819 --> 10:05.271
she took you on treks to the
far reaches of the globe?

10:05.272 --> 10:08.462
Destinations where there
wasn't even running water.

10:08.996 --> 10:11.138
My mother likes to travel.
She always has.

10:11.139 --> 10:13.265
Those weren't vacations, Jason.

10:13.348 --> 10:15.826
They were research trips...

10:15.875 --> 10:20.529
investigating a woman
who was burned at the stake 400 years ago.

10:21.675 --> 10:23.631
Margaret Isabelle Theroux?

10:24.088 --> 10:27.547
The countess whose spirit
possessed your girlfriend.

10:27.685 --> 10:29.585
And the fact that it
happened soon after you

10:29.595 --> 10:32.008
and your mother came into
Lana's life, well...

10:32.460 --> 10:34.065
that bothers me.

10:34.088 --> 10:35.593
That bothers me a lot.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.755
I had nothing to do with that.

10:37.987 --> 10:40.714
I would never put Lana in jeopardy.

10:40.715 --> 10:44.546
And I believe you,
or I wouldn't offer you this job.

10:44.732 --> 10:47.394
What exactly is it that you want me to do?

10:50.765 --> 10:53.612
I have deep pockets, Jason.

10:53.760 --> 10:58.735
Vast resources.
But the one thing I don't have is access.

10:59.469 --> 11:01.734
Two women in your life
are somehow intimately

11:01.740 --> 11:04.009
connected to Margaret
Isabelle Theroux.

11:04.624 --> 11:07.803
I want you to find out everything they know.

11:08.556 --> 11:10.999
So, what, you want me to spy on them?

11:11.786 --> 11:15.002
How you get the information is up to you.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.758
Now I need an answer.

11:32.247 --> 11:33.530
Coop.

11:34.005 --> 11:35.991
Can you hear me?

11:39.732 --> 11:42.719
It's Lois,
your, um, drinking buddy.

11:43.586 --> 11:48.999
I am so sorry this happened to you,
but I swear to god, I didn't do it.

11:52.808 --> 11:57.213
Last night, I would've given anything
to shut him up. And now...

11:57.489 --> 12:01.776
come on, Lois. We gotta get outta
here before someone sees you.

12:03.318 --> 12:06.991
Maybe someone close to Coop
knows something we don't.

12:07.586 --> 12:09.273
Lois, I...

12:09.778 --> 12:12.052
I don't think that
grandma Betty from

12:12.060 --> 12:14.281
Topeka is gonna
have the answer.

12:15.785 --> 12:17.726
But his girlfriend Monique might.

12:17.727 --> 12:19.466
How do you know it's his girlfriend?

12:19.467 --> 12:21.597
When the card ends with
"I'll love you forever and ever,"

12:21.600 --> 12:23.915
" it's a bit of a giveaway."

12:25.554 --> 12:28.172
The girls of Alpha Alpha Alpha
Hope you get well soon!

12:37.294 --> 12:40.879
This truck looks like it can do everything
but take off and fly.

12:40.892 --> 12:43.234
Hey, check it out. You hit this button...

12:43.235 --> 12:45.335
the operator's there to help you
out with whatever you need...

12:45.342 --> 12:48.409
ATM locations, movie
times, you name it.

12:48.982 --> 12:50.564
That's pretty cool.

12:50.790 --> 12:53.743
Yeah, I hear next year's model is even sweeter.

12:53.936 --> 12:56.450
Unless you want something sportier.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.913
What, you're saying I get a truck like this
if I come here to play?

13:01.359 --> 13:06.263
Let's just say certain alumni are
nice enough to loan their athletes rides.

13:08.582 --> 13:11.833
Clark, college football is big business.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.419
I mean, you get a lot,
but they expect a lot in return.

13:15.745 --> 13:17.801
You have to be better than good.

13:19.501 --> 13:22.084
You have to be a hero out there.

13:30.386 --> 13:31.543
Yeah, I thought you
might want to see where

13:31.549 --> 13:33.380
you're gonna be spending
your Saturdays.

13:45.967 --> 13:55.967
<i>Clark Kent, quarterback
he's a Bulldog, that's a fact.</i>

13:56.633 --> 13:58.649
<i>Clark Kent, quarterback...</i>

13:58.650 --> 14:02.810
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, playing quarterback
for your Metropolis Bulldogs,</i>

14:02.811 --> 14:07.152
<i>from Smallville, Kansas...
number 8, Clark Kent!</i>

14:07.296 --> 14:08.890
It's pretty cool, huh?

14:08.891 --> 14:10.231
That's an understatement.

14:10.257 --> 14:12.857
Get used to it, buddy.
It's just the beginning.

14:12.858 --> 14:15.601
The golden arm of Kansas has arrived.
It's a pleasure to meet you, son.

14:15.602 --> 14:17.317
Coach, it's a pleasure to meet you.

14:17.318 --> 14:20.030
I know a lot of other schools
are coming at you, Clark.

14:20.031 --> 14:23.310
But you go with Met U.,
And you're gonna win a national championship.

14:23.311 --> 14:25.087
Sounds good to me.

14:25.253 --> 14:27.116
Try this on for size.

14:27.412 --> 14:28.621
Coach,

14:28.622 --> 14:29.887
thanks.

14:30.430 --> 14:33.733
I know you're gonna make
the right decision, son.

14:37.124 --> 14:39.824
Clark, Gary Bergen... metro motors.

14:39.825 --> 14:43.724
On behalf of the Bulldog booster club,
welcome to Met U.

14:43.725 --> 14:48.821
If there is anything that you need,
you know where to call.

14:53.273 --> 14:55.967
Everybody wants a winning team, Clark...

14:55.968 --> 14:58.446
it's guys like me and you
that make it happen.

14:59.667 --> 15:01.490
Waw, this is amazing.

15:01.491 --> 15:04.760
Dude, you haven't seen nothing yet.

15:11.422 --> 15:13.039
Hi, Clark!

15:14.201 --> 15:17.246
The Tri Alphas are big football fans.

15:17.247 --> 15:18.705
Yeah?

15:19.255 --> 15:22.105
So, we did a little
detective work and found

15:22.131 --> 15:24.954
out that your favorite
flavor was chocolate.

15:24.955 --> 15:27.046
So we made you cake.

15:27.047 --> 15:30.042
Why, you didn't have to go
through all that trouble.

15:30.043 --> 15:34.108
Anything we can do to help you
commit to Met U., Clark.

15:35.069 --> 15:37.318
How about a tour of the house?

15:41.705 --> 15:44.365
Go ahead, C.K. Take your time.

15:44.366 --> 15:46.615
I'll see you back at the dorm.

15:54.130 --> 15:55.970
So you two roommates?

15:55.971 --> 15:58.045
Um... no.

15:58.498 --> 16:01.209
My roommate's on her way
to visit Coop at the hospital.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.973
He's her boyfriend.

16:04.679 --> 16:06.268
Clark?

16:06.269 --> 16:08.677
From what we hear...

16:09.382 --> 16:11.897
not only do you have an incredible arm,

16:11.898 --> 16:14.253
you've got great hands.

16:15.748 --> 16:19.421
Really?
Somebody said that to you about me?

16:19.999 --> 16:21.533
Clark...

16:22.364 --> 16:25.325
um, you've got a great view out this window.

16:25.326 --> 16:28.613
Yeah,
if you like brick walls.

16:30.134 --> 16:34.141
Let me show you
an even better view.

16:36.042 --> 16:38.555
I meant the ivy.

16:40.131 --> 16:42.028
What was that?

16:47.629 --> 16:49.597
Let me go check it out.

16:58.678 --> 17:00.736
Uh... some sweaters fell down...

17:00.737 --> 17:02.276
in there.

17:02.277 --> 17:04.858
Um, could I... could I get something to drink?

17:04.858 --> 17:06.294
Um...

17:06.531 --> 17:08.781
yeah. Sure.

17:13.917 --> 17:15.851
And maybe something to eat?

17:22.371 --> 17:24.151
Lois, what are you doing here?

17:24.284 --> 17:26.275
I could ask you the same question,

17:26.276 --> 17:28.400
but it seems fairly obvious... hef.

17:28.401 --> 17:30.413
What, you just break
into people's places now?

17:30.513 --> 17:31.984
Coop's girlfriend wasn't here, so I

17:32.090 --> 17:33.309
thought I'd take
a look around.

17:33.511 --> 17:34.624
A real page-turner.

17:34.650 --> 17:37.728
"I gained two pounds. From
now on, it's no carbs."

17:37.729 --> 17:39.368
She's no Hemingway, but still...

17:39.369 --> 17:40.946
I don't have time for this.

17:40.947 --> 17:42.353
Here it is.

17:43.391 --> 17:45.181
"Coop is meeting with a newspaper"

17:45.207 --> 17:46.871
reporter and being
super-secretive.

17:46.872 --> 17:50.915
"It has something to do with the football
team, but I don't know what it is."

17:52.814 --> 17:54.184
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

18:00.644 --> 18:02.682
Hey, Clark...

18:03.071 --> 18:05.540
would you like a piece of this?

18:10.564 --> 18:11.478
Hi.

18:28.014 --> 18:29.385
Hey, buddy.

18:29.386 --> 18:31.015
Feeling better?

18:36.912 --> 18:39.179
I see it's starting to wear off.

18:48.525 --> 18:51.442
Eventually, you're gonna be able to talk.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.093
And when you do,

18:54.343 --> 18:56.908
you're gonna tell the world about me...

18:57.489 --> 19:00.125
like you were gonna do before I stopped you.

19:33.236 --> 19:34.853
I'm sorry, Coop.

19:58.709 --> 20:00.499
I thought I told you to wait outside.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.062
I don't do well with waiting,
especially when I'm awaiting trial.

20:03.070 --> 20:04.973
I want to hear what Geoff knows.

20:05.387 --> 20:07.144
Speaking of Geoff...

20:08.935 --> 20:10.140
hey.

20:13.163 --> 20:15.517
You've, uh, met my friend Lois.

20:17.715 --> 20:19.630
Coach just called.

20:22.674 --> 20:24.555
Coop's dead, Clark.

20:26.641 --> 20:28.345
Oh, my god.

20:30.038 --> 20:31.374
When?

20:31.544 --> 20:33.244
An hour ago.

20:33.715 --> 20:36.457
His vitals were getting better, and then

20:37.079 --> 20:39.773
the doctor said he just stopped breathing.

20:40.615 --> 20:43.942
Look, Geoff, we know Coop
was going to the newspaper

20:43.958 --> 20:46.433
about something involving
the football team.

20:46.768 --> 20:48.491
Lois, I don't think this is the best time...

20:48.492 --> 20:49.722
and when would be the
best time, Clark...

20:49.725 --> 20:51.274
when I'm on the chain gang?

20:52.341 --> 20:54.349
I'm sorry. She's under a lot of stress lately.

20:54.350 --> 20:57.085
No. Stress is when
you're stuck in traffic,

20:57.095 --> 20:59.670
or you have a midterm for a class
you've never been to.

20:59.677 --> 21:01.553
I'm out on bail,
and looking to be

21:01.579 --> 21:03.679
locked up for manslaughter.

21:06.518 --> 21:08.362
Clark, can I talk to you for a second?

21:08.363 --> 21:09.562
Look...

21:10.381 --> 21:12.472
I'm sorry about Coop.

21:12.473 --> 21:14.025
I really am.

21:14.436 --> 21:16.236
But if you have
something to say about me,

21:16.272 --> 21:17.649
say it to my face,

21:17.650 --> 21:20.555
because I have this little pet peeve
about people talking behind my back.

21:20.575 --> 21:21.998
Lois...

21:22.609 --> 21:23.945
Please.

21:25.208 --> 21:26.966
I'll catch up with you later.

21:37.701 --> 21:39.587
I can't tell you how
to pick your friends,

21:39.613 --> 21:41.231
Clark, but that chick
seems like trouble.

21:41.232 --> 21:42.821
I'm starting to figure that out.

21:42.822 --> 21:45.616
Yeah, it's probably best if you tell her
not to come around here.

21:47.090 --> 21:49.429
She's done enough damage already.

21:55.240 --> 21:58.318
I can't believe that you would
even consider working for him.

21:58.319 --> 22:00.745
- It's not that black and white.
- I think it is.

22:00.746 --> 22:04.326
Investigating the countess Theroux?
It's all a ruse.

22:04.332 --> 22:06.416
Lana, the more Lex uses
me, the more I get to

22:06.442 --> 22:08.364
use him and find out
what he really knows.

22:08.365 --> 22:10.645
But that's just more secrets
and more lies, and at

22:10.671 --> 22:13.396
some point, it's all gonna
blow up in our faces.

22:13.424 --> 22:15.633
Well, unfortunately, when
dealing with people like Lex

22:15.659 --> 22:17.924
and my mother, honesty isn't
necessarily the way to go.

22:17.927 --> 22:20.725
It doesn't matter. I am done lying.

22:20.726 --> 22:22.490
I can't go along with this.

22:22.745 --> 22:25.706
We've hit a brick wall. Our research
with the countess is going nowhere.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.447
This might be our way
of breaking through.

22:27.455 --> 22:29.762
Or their way of breaking us up.

22:31.798 --> 22:33.942
I'm not gonna let that happen.

22:35.815 --> 22:37.378
Trust me.

22:38.359 --> 22:43.147
How can I trust someone
who's willing to lie for a living?

22:45.931 --> 22:50.014
As far as I'm concerned,
if you think that Lex knows something,

22:50.015 --> 22:52.555
then there's only one way to find out.

22:59.949 --> 23:02.575
Who the hell do you think you are?

23:02.576 --> 23:04.107
Is something bothering you, Lana?

23:04.108 --> 23:06.534
If you wanna know something about me, Lex? Ask.

23:06.535 --> 23:11.053
Don't go recruiting my boyfriend...
to conduct some covert investigation.

23:11.054 --> 23:14.707
Contrary to what you may think,
I'm on your side.

23:14.708 --> 23:18.171
And how would I know that?
With you, everything seems like it's a secret.

23:18.172 --> 23:21.044
What you may perceive as secrecy,
I see as precautions.

23:21.045 --> 23:24.275
I'm a big girl, Lex. I don't need precautions.

23:24.276 --> 23:26.121
I need the truth.

23:27.104 --> 23:31.304
Sometimes, we think we want the truth
until we actually get it.

23:31.947 --> 23:36.586
Lana, if you want me to be honest with you,
I will, but you're not gonna like it.

23:37.621 --> 23:41.134
If you're gonna feed me some story about Jason,

23:41.135 --> 23:42.998
I'm not interested.

23:44.174 --> 23:47.255
Look, I understand he means a lot to you,

23:47.287 --> 23:49.518
but when you're ready to talk,

23:49.769 --> 23:51.439
let me know.

23:53.685 --> 23:55.566
You can let yourself out.

24:04.106 --> 24:07.129
Coop was more than just a great football player.

24:07.152 --> 24:08.755
He was a great guy.

24:09.666 --> 24:11.547
He cared a lot about

24:11.641 --> 24:14.471
what was right
and what was wrong.

24:15.039 --> 24:17.287
Well... to Coop.

24:17.288 --> 24:19.098
- To Coop!
- To Coop!

24:20.016 --> 24:22.740
Well, he would've wanted a party, so...

24:23.313 --> 24:25.053
let's give him a party.

24:26.816 --> 24:28.643
You're not drinking?

24:28.824 --> 24:30.986
What's the matter?
You never had a beer before?

24:31.100 --> 24:32.963
Sure I have.

24:33.527 --> 24:37.165
Yeah, right.
I know where you're coming from, C.K.

24:37.872 --> 24:40.315
But all that's gonna change.

24:50.979 --> 24:53.492
Don't you think you should slow down a little bit?

25:00.887 --> 25:03.962
Kent, you're from the same town as me, so...

25:05.054 --> 25:07.251
I'm gonna be straight with you.

25:08.004 --> 25:12.037
Being a Bulldog is a dream come true,
but you're in the pressure cooker now.

25:12.038 --> 25:14.235
All they want is a winner.

25:16.172 --> 25:18.140
It takes a toll on you.

25:26.689 --> 25:28.007
Um...

25:28.865 --> 25:31.189
Sit tight. Be right back, okay?

25:39.463 --> 25:42.384
I told you before, Marcus
we meet in private.

25:42.385 --> 25:43.990
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm bringing the urine sample by.

25:43.991 --> 25:46.149
Oh, that's a great idea,
bring it to my buddy's wake.

25:46.150 --> 25:47.622
Well, you said you were gonna pay me today.

25:47.623 --> 25:50.623
I told you, never come to me.
I come to you.

25:50.624 --> 25:52.966
- We'll meet tomorrow.
- You said you'd pay me today, man.

25:52.967 --> 25:55.181
I need my money.

26:03.332 --> 26:04.921
Just... just get out of here.

26:04.922 --> 26:06.574
What just happened to me?

26:06.579 --> 26:08.814
I don't know, man. You fell over
or something. I don't know.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.551
Don't worry about it.

26:16.714 --> 26:18.841
Drink up, Kent.

26:19.172 --> 26:20.560
To Coop.

26:28.310 --> 26:30.589
Chloe, if you're trying to
milk any money out of this

26:30.615 --> 26:33.248
university, you may not want to
be seen within 100 feet of me.

26:33.249 --> 26:35.861
Lois, you're innocent,
and this autopsy

26:35.887 --> 26:38.564
is more than likely
going to prove that.

26:39.743 --> 26:41.764
Your father's birth city?

26:41.765 --> 26:44.911
What, are you applying for
financial aid or to the C.I.A.?

26:44.912 --> 26:45.966
I know.

26:46.937 --> 26:49.029
Hey, Clark. Is something wrong?

26:51.189 --> 26:53.416
I think Geoff Johns paralyzed Coop.

26:53.417 --> 26:54.554
What?

26:54.555 --> 26:57.986
He's passing his physicals
by using another student's urine samples.

26:58.187 --> 27:01.015
Black market pee?
What's he trying to cover up...

27:01.116 --> 27:02.276
drugs?

27:02.388 --> 27:06.447
I don't think so.
I think it's something else.

27:06.829 --> 27:08.751
I just saw him touch this
kid, and he put him straight

27:08.777 --> 27:10.393
to the ground like he hit
him with a stun gun.

27:10.394 --> 27:13.427
And the linebackers... they always say
when they get stiff-armed by Geoff Jones,

27:13.428 --> 27:15.787
they don't know what hit them.
They go down to the turf every time.

27:15.788 --> 27:18.389
I think he has a meteor power.

27:19.118 --> 27:24.596
Using your powers on the field to cheat...
it's pathetic, but it's not paralyzing someone.

27:24.597 --> 27:27.413
What if he can control the intensity
when he stuns people?

27:27.414 --> 27:30.509
If that's true, you're gonna have to
find a way to prove it, because...

27:30.510 --> 27:32.873
nobody outside the Smallville
city limits is going to

27:32.899 --> 27:35.885
believe the Bulldog superstar
has superhuman powers.

27:35.986 --> 27:38.295
The pee peddler may know the truth about Geoff.

27:38.296 --> 27:40.605
- Can you track him down?
- Yeah.

27:40.606 --> 27:42.415
I'm gonna go to the
football dorm.

27:42.441 --> 27:45.592
I'm gonna try to find Geoff
before he can hurt someone else.

27:56.386 --> 27:58.477
Time to see what Mr. Peebody knows.

27:58.478 --> 28:00.871
I'm gonna go door-to-door
in the dorm and see if

28:00.897 --> 28:03.288
I can get any insight into
the real Geoff Johns.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.767
Excuse me.

28:10.213 --> 28:11.888
Do you know where
a person can get some

28:11.895 --> 28:13.959
clean number one around here?

28:15.200 --> 28:17.485
I don't know what you're talking about.

28:17.911 --> 28:20.009
Don't play dumb with me, pee-wee.
Either you

28:20.235 --> 28:22.323
tell me everything you know
about Geoff Johns, or...

28:22.324 --> 28:24.491
you wanna know about me?

28:25.187 --> 28:27.721
Ask away...
Get lost Marcus.

28:27.722 --> 28:29.534
Um, I'm just curious,

28:29.535 --> 28:32.596
do you think you're gonna be drafted
to the sharks? 'Cause I'm a huge fan.

28:32.597 --> 28:34.723
So why are you talking to Marcus?

28:35.509 --> 28:37.467
What do you really want to know?

28:37.468 --> 28:40.588
Nothing, I swear.
Just what I asked you.

28:40.606 --> 28:44.279
I guess I'm gonna have to wait
and see like everyone else. Bye.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.382
Look, I never wanted to use my powers.

28:58.266 --> 29:01.799
In high school,
I played ball fair and square, but now,

29:01.800 --> 29:05.263
there's just...
too much pressure to win.

29:29.843 --> 29:30.779
Lois!

29:30.801 --> 29:33.947
I need your pass to get in the dorm!

29:34.182 --> 29:35.763
Lois?

29:43.125 --> 29:44.707
Lois!

29:55.363 --> 29:56.611
Lois.

30:01.706 --> 30:02.818
Clark,

30:02.832 --> 30:04.945
Clark, I think Geoff has Lois.

30:04.946 --> 30:06.302
- Where?
- I don't know, but...

30:06.341 --> 30:08.693
We were in the parking lot,
and the next thing I knew,

30:08.700 --> 30:11.135
Geoff Johns' car is flying
by, and Lois is gone.

30:11.189 --> 30:14.473
I tried to talk to the campus police,
but they weren't any help. To them,

30:14.474 --> 30:17.139
Geoff is like a hero.
They worship the ground he walks on.

30:17.140 --> 30:19.030
Lois could be anywhere by now, Clark.

30:19.031 --> 30:21.491
No, if they're in his car,
there might be a way to track them down.

30:21.492 --> 30:23.152
I hate to break it to
you, but this is a

30:23.178 --> 30:24.771
little bit bigger
city than Smallville.

30:24.772 --> 30:26.945
He got his car from a booster
at Metropolis motors.

30:26.971 --> 30:28.408
It's got a trip
star system in it.

30:28.409 --> 30:30.678
If we can get the P.I.N. Number,
we can use your cell phone

30:30.704 --> 30:32.910
and computer to maybe hack in
and find out where they are.

30:32.911 --> 30:35.225
Okay, but then how are we
gonna get the P.I.N.?

30:35.226 --> 30:38.555
They keep those things under lock
and key at the dealership.

30:38.556 --> 30:41.948
What are you gonna do...
break in and rip open the safe?

30:42.690 --> 30:44.251
Of course not.

31:27.645 --> 31:29.279
Don't worry.

31:30.205 --> 31:31.963
It'll be quick.

31:36.195 --> 31:39.240
I'm so sorry.
I... I never meant to hurt anyone.

31:41.689 --> 31:43.833
But I don't have a choice.

32:08.862 --> 32:10.166
- Are we in yet?
- Yeah,

32:10.167 --> 32:15.193
all we gotta do is dial up, use the code,
and do our best impression of Geoff Johns.

32:19.874 --> 32:22.652
You know, that was, um,
a pretty quick errand, Clark.

32:22.653 --> 32:25.698
I mean, metro motors is all the way
on the other side of the city.

32:25.699 --> 32:27.140
I hurried.

32:31.068 --> 32:33.226
Hello, Mr. Johns.
How can I help you?

32:33.227 --> 32:35.285
Hello. Hi, um...

32:35.286 --> 32:38.883
I'm driving in Metropolis, and I seem
to have made a wrong turn. There's no...

32:38.884 --> 32:42.921
street signs, and my map screen is broken.
Could you tell me where I am?

32:42.922 --> 32:44.451
No problem, sir. One moment.

32:45.683 --> 32:48.594
- You're at 3rd and grand. Have a ni...
- Thank you.

32:48.595 --> 32:52.479
Great, all right, let's go, I'll drive.

32:53.042 --> 32:54.289
Clark?

33:27.007 --> 33:28.226
Why isn't it working?

33:28.227 --> 33:29.684
Tell me where she is!

33:29.685 --> 33:31.291
It was never supposed to be like this, Clark.

33:31.292 --> 33:32.429
Where is she?!

33:32.430 --> 33:35.588
I never even used my powers in high school,
but when I came to college,

33:35.589 --> 33:39.437
I had to win so bad, I started.
I couldn't stop.

33:44.493 --> 33:46.087
Geoff, listen to me.

33:46.088 --> 33:49.953
You have to tell me where she is.
You don't want to murder another person.

33:49.954 --> 33:52.849
Coop was gonna tell the world
that Teflon tailback was

33:52.875 --> 33:55.854
some kind of freak cheating his
way into the record books.

33:55.955 --> 33:58.556
I couldn't let him do that.

33:59.085 --> 34:01.071
Tell me where she is.

34:01.646 --> 34:03.016
Please...

34:04.725 --> 34:07.050
She's down there.

34:22.030 --> 34:23.629
Lois!

34:36.300 --> 34:37.757
Lois!

34:38.560 --> 34:39.911
Lois?

34:40.333 --> 34:41.704
Lois!

34:42.275 --> 34:44.161
Lois, can you hear me?

34:45.632 --> 34:46.635
Clark...

34:46.654 --> 34:49.043
Okay, we're going to be okay.

34:55.947 --> 34:57.502
Is Lois going to be okay?

34:57.503 --> 35:02.153
Luckily, the paralysis wears off.
She's already been released from the hospital.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.188
Who would've thought?

35:04.189 --> 35:06.302
Geoff Johns seemed like such a nice kid.

35:06.303 --> 35:08.417
Yeah, if I take this
football scholarship,

35:08.443 --> 35:11.089
I'm going to be in the same
situation as Geoff.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.928
I'm gonna have to lie on every physical...

35:14.929 --> 35:16.880
rig every test.

35:17.256 --> 35:21.209
I'm gonna have to do anything I can
to protect my secret.

35:21.808 --> 35:25.870
I want to believe that I can go out there
and play football like any normal college kid,

35:25.871 --> 35:29.526
but the fact is, I have powers
that no other athlete has.

35:30.624 --> 35:32.416
Coop was right.

35:32.448 --> 35:34.857
It's not fair that Geoff was
out there on that field,

35:34.858 --> 35:37.833
just like it's not fair
when I'm out there competing.

35:40.838 --> 35:43.386
So I've decided to give up football.

35:44.815 --> 35:46.221
Clark...

35:50.672 --> 35:54.571
I know how difficult it is
to give up something you love.

35:54.572 --> 35:58.027
But this decision you've made,
son, shows...

35:58.028 --> 36:01.262
integrity well beyond your years.

36:02.865 --> 36:05.220
Then why don't I feel good about it?

36:14.618 --> 36:16.394
Look at me, Clark.

36:17.581 --> 36:22.129
If you have your heart set on going to Met U.
Or any other school,

36:23.201 --> 36:27.576
somehow, someway, your mother and
I will make sure that you get to go.

36:28.171 --> 36:30.003
Is that understood?

36:36.493 --> 36:37.829
Yeah.

36:40.044 --> 36:41.467
Good.

36:47.039 --> 36:51.392
This photograph of Jason and his mother
was taken in Paris...

36:51.393 --> 36:53.994
a day before he met you.

36:58.054 --> 37:00.953
No, that can't be.
His mom was in the Hamptons.

37:00.954 --> 37:05.807
Look, Lana, I'm not gonna be so presumptuous
as to judge Jason's integrity,

37:05.808 --> 37:08.022
but I'll lay out a few facts.

37:08.893 --> 37:14.183
Genevieve Teague has been researching
the countess since before Jason was born.

37:14.316 --> 37:17.726
He grew up in a house full of
ancient artifacts and reams

37:17.752 --> 37:20.901
of research material about
Margaret Isabelle Theroux.

37:20.902 --> 37:22.340
He never told me that.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.566
Contrary to what you may think,

37:24.567 --> 37:28.222
Jason's been aware of the countess
since he was a child.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.184
No.

37:33.454 --> 37:35.629
No, I don't believe that.

37:35.630 --> 37:38.038
You have to ask yourself, Lana,

37:39.546 --> 37:42.823
how well do you really
know Jason Teague?

37:54.153 --> 37:57.650
Knock knock! You should think about
putting up a door or something.

37:57.651 --> 37:59.634
I don't know, maybe it's
a city thing, but where

37:59.660 --> 38:02.337
I come from, we like to
have a little privacy.

38:03.016 --> 38:06.145
Lois, who would've thought that
I'd be relieved to hear your voice?

38:06.146 --> 38:07.802
Look, Clark,

38:07.803 --> 38:10.045
I don't know how you did it, but

38:10.046 --> 38:14.184
if it weren't for you, I'd be at the bottom
of the Mississippi right about now.

38:14.185 --> 38:15.521
Thanks.

38:15.608 --> 38:19.227
I'm just glad you're okay
and going back to school.

38:19.725 --> 38:21.509
That's not entirely true.

38:21.510 --> 38:24.744
I kind of got punted out of the university.

38:24.841 --> 38:27.099
I thought you were cleared of all charges.

38:27.100 --> 38:30.150
Oh, I was, but...
see, the thing is, I am

38:30.151 --> 38:32.828
still busted
for the booze, and, well...

38:32.829 --> 38:36.635
that wasn't the first time I've been invited
to the disciplinary board's kangaroo court.

38:36.636 --> 38:38.762
Why am I not surprised?

38:38.833 --> 38:40.389
You heading back to the barracks?

38:40.390 --> 38:42.730
Not an option. My dad's
trying out the tough love

38:42.735 --> 38:44.875
approach with an
emphasis on "tough."

38:45.176 --> 38:47.602
So are you gonna go stay with Chloe?

38:47.804 --> 38:50.854
They've got a tiny one-bedroom apartment.
I can't do that to them.

38:50.855 --> 38:53.772
It's fine, really.
I'm just gonna check into a motel,

38:54.119 --> 38:56.640
and when the money runs out, I can
always sleep in my car. The back

38:56.666 --> 38:59.349
seat's not too bad if you bend your
knees and avoid the drive train and

38:59.350 --> 38:59.980
Lois...

38:59.986 --> 39:04.989
you know, if I have to sell my car for food,
that's okay, too. I've always dreamed of

39:04.990 --> 39:09.516
being a hobo, riding the rails,
cooking beans over roadside fires...

39:11.761 --> 39:13.584
if you want, I guess you could stay with us.

39:13.585 --> 39:17.363
You're a lifesaver.
God. Am I in need of a hot shower.

39:18.120 --> 39:21.958
Don't worry, Smallville.
I'll try to keep it under a half-hour.

39:25.775 --> 39:27.286
What just happened?

39:40.886 --> 39:42.258
Hey!

39:42.393 --> 39:45.623
Looks like you've got a carpool buddy
for weekenders back to Smallville.

39:45.624 --> 39:47.112
You got into Met U.?

39:47.113 --> 39:49.372
The financial guy said that
it's pretty much a lock.

39:49.398 --> 39:50.225
Can you believe it?

39:50.226 --> 39:51.971
Now I don't actually have to rob banks.

39:51.972 --> 39:54.230
Oh, Chloe, congratulations.
You deserve it.

39:54.231 --> 39:56.384
Thank you. You just have
to promise me one thing...

39:56.410 --> 39:58.347
that once you're
everybody's All-American,

39:58.348 --> 40:01.314
you will still remember
your old high school buddy.

40:01.315 --> 40:04.042
I mean, you'll still say hi
to me on campus and stuff.

40:04.043 --> 40:06.402
Yeah, um, well, I'm not going to Met U.

40:06.403 --> 40:07.603
What?

40:08.299 --> 40:10.178
What happened?
Did another school

40:10.204 --> 40:12.198
sweep down and give you the
keys to the kingdom?

40:12.199 --> 40:16.281
I'm not playing football anymore.
I turned down my scholarship.

40:17.951 --> 40:20.255
Let me get this straight. You
were offered a full ride

40:20.281 --> 40:22.392
with chrome wheels to play
the game that you love,

40:22.393 --> 40:25.907
and you said, "thanks, but no thanks?"

40:27.129 --> 40:30.491
I don't know, I'm just not sure
that football's my calling.

40:35.937 --> 40:37.800
I'm proud of you, Clark.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.567
You're proud of me?

40:40.915 --> 40:42.409
Why?

40:44.196 --> 40:46.971
I just have a feeling that
you're destined to do a

40:46.985 --> 40:50.159
a lot more in this world than
just score touchdowns.

40:50.609 --> 40:53.948
Chloe, you've been saying a lot
of weird things to me lately.

40:54.258 --> 40:57.105
What makes you think
I'm destined to do anything?

40:58.860 --> 41:00.558
Just a hunch.
