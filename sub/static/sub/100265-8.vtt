01:15.742 --> 01:18.953
In order to stage a mutiny,
there are a few things you need to know.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.705
One: How much time do you have?

01:20.789 --> 01:21.623
<i> </i>Not much.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.167
As soon as the robot gets that engine
in place,

01:24.250 --> 01:26.711
Hastings will launch and abandon everyone
down on that planet.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.421
Two: Know your target.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.382
The bridge. Can't control
the ship from anywhere else.

01:31.466 --> 01:34.302
- And three: Your obstacles.
- There's too many to count,<i> </i>

01:34.385 --> 01:36.387
but let's start with security.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.473
We're currently operating
with a skeleton crew,

01:38.556 --> 01:40.934
which means we've only got
18 security officers on board.

01:41.017 --> 01:44.104
Only 18. How are we supposed
to neutralize 18 highly trained guards?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.606
We don't need to neutralize 18 of them.
Just one.

01:46.689 --> 01:47.732
This guy.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.193
He'll be armed.
So you have to be prepared.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.613
Wait, I'll have to be prepared?

01:55.865 --> 01:57.700
You know, you can overpower someone

01:57.784 --> 02:00.495
without ever even laying a hand on them.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.412
How's that?

02:01.496 --> 02:02.539
Find their weak spot.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.458
Everyone has one.
You just have to dig a little,

02:06.000 --> 02:07.877
-and find out where it is.
-Samantha--

02:07.961 --> 02:10.213
Her father was a security officer
on the ship.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.508
Maybe her mom knows something
about this guy.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.344
Maybe you could go talk to them.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.639
It's me and my dad.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.766
It's the last one I have of him.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.564
Smith.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.482
Smith.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.027
Smith. Will you go find out
if she knows anything?

02:33.444 --> 02:34.988
I, uh, I really shouldn't.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.158
What are you talking about? You're good
at getting into people's minds.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.409
In, like, a nice way, though.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.245
I think it's best if I'm not seen
with all of you.

02:42.328 --> 02:45.331
Now that I'm in on the inside
with Hastings and all.

02:46.749 --> 02:47.625
I'll go do it.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.805
Hey, let's keep going.

03:02.223 --> 03:03.725
Now, Penny, your turn.

03:03.808 --> 03:06.519
I need you to get something important
for your mom.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.813
Me? Okay, what do I need to get?

03:09.480 --> 03:10.523
A crew.

03:14.819 --> 03:15.904
Yeah, keep it up.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.323
In 30,000 years I'll be free.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.576
Is this your card?

03:23.661 --> 03:24.495
Hey, Don.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.207
-Hey. This is a jailbreak, right?
-Uh, yeah.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.875
Yes! Where's the key?

03:29.667 --> 03:31.544
It's not a key exactly.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.676
What am I supposed to do with that?

03:47.644 --> 03:49.229
There goes my security deposit.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.669
<i>Mom, I talked</i>
<i>to Samantha's mother about that guard.</i>

04:12.752 --> 04:14.587
<i>Remember this name.</i>

04:19.717 --> 04:21.302
Don West back in action.

04:21.719 --> 04:22.595
Oh...

04:28.059 --> 04:30.353
Yeah. Otherwise,
we're not going to have enough.

04:30.853 --> 04:31.771
Don?

04:31.854 --> 04:33.690
Ava. Hey, I was just coming to see you.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.066
Just give me a minute.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.859
What are you doing out?

04:37.151 --> 04:37.986
Uh...

04:38.569 --> 04:40.446
-You know I to have to report this.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.032
Listen, how many of your people
are still down on the planet?

04:43.491 --> 04:44.617
A lot. Why?

04:47.870 --> 04:48.913
Where's Scarecrow?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.207
He's not doing so well. So we moved him.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.418
Maybe Robot can help him.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.503
I hope so. One thing at a time.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.019
Permission to enter the bridge.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.478
Permission granted.

05:15.648 --> 05:16.774
What is it?

05:17.817 --> 05:21.738
We can't strand 500 colonists
and crew members down there.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.948
We'll send a relief crew back
to collect them

05:24.032 --> 05:25.950
as soon as the <i>Resolute</i>
reaches Alpha Centauri.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.910
We don't even know where we are.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.747
What if we can't find our way back?

05:30.830 --> 05:33.833
Those are questions it's up to scientists
like you to answer.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.337
Captain, engine number four
just went offline.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.298
You should answer that.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.722
Engine room, you have the bridge.
What's your emergency?

05:47.805 --> 05:50.058
<i>Thrusters 1 through 168 mainline </i>

05:50.141 --> 05:51.601
<i>and reserve units are not responding.</i>

05:51.684 --> 05:52.643
That's all of them.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.188
This is the captain. How long
do you estimate repairs will take?

05:55.271 --> 05:56.689
<i>They're not malfunctioning, Captain.</i>

05:56.773 --> 05:58.775
Then what exactly
is the problem?

05:58.858 --> 06:01.444
<i>It seems they'll only respond to orders</i>
<i>from Maureen Robinson.</i>

06:06.949 --> 06:08.451
You really trust these people?

06:09.535 --> 06:10.453
With my life.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.708
Escort Maureen Robinson and her associates
off the bridge.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.002
Incarcerate her with her husband.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.422
All security to the bridge.

06:21.756 --> 06:22.965
We have a situation.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.978
Let's not make this more difficult
than it needs to be.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.064
Anton Penn is still down there.

06:38.147 --> 06:38.981
Who?

06:39.065 --> 06:42.235
You never caught his name,
but he's the one who dragged you to safety

06:42.318 --> 06:43.486
during the last attack.

06:44.529 --> 06:45.905
You had a broken ankle.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.240
You were unarmed,

06:47.323 --> 06:49.784
and you didn't think that there was anyone
who would help you.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.077
But he did.

06:52.787 --> 06:53.704
I gave you an order.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.877
Now, you're Anton's last chance.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.505
Remove her!

07:02.588 --> 07:03.881
One second till--

07:07.552 --> 07:09.262
I'm afraid I can't do that, ma'am.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.640
Go! Move!

07:12.723 --> 07:13.933
Come on!

07:27.530 --> 07:28.865
I think it's ready.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.286
Bridge, we've lost power.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.580
That's not an accident.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.208
Maureen, what are you doing on the bridge?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.211
<i>Giving orders.</i> <i>It should be</i>
<i>obvious by now</i> <i>that we're not leaving</i>

07:42.295 --> 07:43.504
<i>this solar system just yet,</i>

07:43.588 --> 07:45.089
so let's all take a step back,

07:45.923 --> 07:48.676
and let my son and the robot go back
to our Jupiter.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.597
No one's keeping Will here,
or the robot.

07:53.514 --> 07:56.100
I thought we were all working towards
a common goal.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.853
<i>But it's not really all of us, is it?</i>

07:58.936 --> 08:00.563
We're still 500 short.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.316
What's my mom talking about?

08:04.025 --> 08:06.652
Isn't everyone coming back onto the ship?

08:08.029 --> 08:09.489
Did you know about this?

08:10.823 --> 08:12.909
Nobody wanted this to happen.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.077
I'm protecting you.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.371
I have been all along.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.333
-Everyone-- Everyone back up, back off.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.085
I don't need protection.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.006
Relax.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.968
No. Let's go.

08:37.892 --> 08:38.768
We're close.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.270
The engine's in place.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.730
I'm not convinced we can...

08:43.314 --> 08:45.608
safely take the robot by force.

08:47.735 --> 08:48.653
We won't need to.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.866
After everything I did
to get in on the inside,

08:53.950 --> 08:55.743
Hastings will know it was me

08:55.910 --> 08:56.953
who turned on him.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.162
You're one of us now.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.082
Well, that's sweet to hear,
and how will that help me?

09:01.165 --> 09:02.542
It means we'll protect you.

09:02.750 --> 09:06.003
As long as I stay in here.
I don't like being cooped up.

09:12.426 --> 09:13.678
How's the mutiny going?

09:14.095 --> 09:15.263
I don't know.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.431
It's my first one. I'll call you later.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.020
I know you think you're doing
the right thing here, Mrs. Robinson,

09:23.104 --> 09:24.522
but if you bring everyone back up,

09:24.605 --> 09:25.856
none of us will survive.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.149
There's not enough air.

09:28.150 --> 09:28.985
That planet...

09:29.819 --> 09:30.736
is a gas giant.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.699
It's made of hydrogen, helium,
a little methane, and ammonia,

09:34.782 --> 09:37.910
and like most gas giants,
being an extremely stormy place,

09:37.994 --> 09:39.328
ionized ammonia--

09:39.412 --> 09:40.496
Ammonium.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.333
Angela already figured out
how to stop the rust virus.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.005
Deoxidize it.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.215
But what I couldn't figure out

09:51.299 --> 09:53.676
was where we'd ever find enough ammonium

09:53.884 --> 09:57.513
to clean 280,000 gallons of water.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.349
Maureen pointed out
what was right in front of my nose.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.519
Do you know how long it would take
the Jupiters to transport all that water

10:03.603 --> 10:05.104
in and out of that planet's atmosphere?

10:05.563 --> 10:07.648
That's why we're not taking the Jupiters.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.402
We're taking the <i>Resolute.</i>

10:26.167 --> 10:27.835
Hey, you, slow down.

10:28.669 --> 10:29.879
I got something for you.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.173
Good.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.426
Ooh...

10:35.509 --> 10:37.094
A rugged look. I like it.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.096
Nice to see you, too.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.473
I saw you two days ago.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.350
I fought SAR and almost died.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.602
I flew through space
in a storage container.

10:44.685 --> 10:45.811
Cool.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.104
No.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.356
Not cool.

10:48.814 --> 10:49.815
Terrible.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.150
Sorry.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.861
Whatever. I have a secret mission
from Mom.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.071
What is it?

10:56.280 --> 10:57.448
It's not for you.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.116
It's for him.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.754
A prison break?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.964
That's a terrible idea.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.426
Come in, why don't you.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.721
I thought you and I could...

11:21.639 --> 11:22.932
talk about a few things.

11:32.233 --> 11:36.570
The complexities of this task are greater
than you can plan in a day.

11:36.654 --> 11:40.032
No, it's pretty simple really. We dive
down into the planet's ammonia belt

11:40.116 --> 11:43.035
suck up enough gas through the intakes
to flush the precipitate

11:43.119 --> 11:44.995
out of the oxygen-generating system.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.622
We get a bunch of clean water

11:46.706 --> 11:48.207
and we'll have enough ammonium gas

11:48.290 --> 11:50.418
to decontaminate all our people
and equipment.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.254
And we go to Alpha Centauri
and start a new life.

11:53.337 --> 11:57.383
The <i>Resolute</i> has never entered
an atmosphere before.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.218
It was built in orbit.

11:59.301 --> 12:02.054
You seem to care more
about the safety of this ship

12:02.138 --> 12:03.431
than the lives of its passengers.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.725
I don't want to leave those people behind,
but this ship,

12:05.850 --> 12:07.852
our ship, is irreplaceable.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.647
It's the last hope of the human race.
All eight billion people.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.192
And one day when this wave of colonists
has made the journey,

12:15.276 --> 12:17.611
there are still parents
and children in Mumbai,

12:17.695 --> 12:19.447
in Paris, in Pasadena,

12:19.530 --> 12:22.408
in every city, and every country
in the world who'll know

12:22.491 --> 12:24.118
that if they pass the test,

12:24.243 --> 12:26.245
if they prove their worth,

12:26.495 --> 12:28.497
they can gain passage.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.876
And what if this ship is destroyed?

12:31.959 --> 12:34.670
What do the children of Earth
dream about then?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.715
We're not going to lose the <i>Resolute.</i>

12:38.382 --> 12:41.469
We're going to spin her, on an X axis,

12:41.552 --> 12:43.053
which will redistribute the gases

12:43.137 --> 12:46.515
and create enough drag so that
we can maintain control of the ship.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.225
That's never been tested.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.186
A lot of things in my line of work

12:50.269 --> 12:51.479
only get one test.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.230
We are good at passing it.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.065
We've sustained significant damage.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.401
The cross supports along F decks
are compromised.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.069
If we do what you propose,

12:59.153 --> 13:01.155
they could tear apart altogether.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.490
If the struts weaken,

13:03.240 --> 13:04.200
we'll be ready.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.330
How?

13:10.915 --> 13:11.832
He's different.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.126
What do you mean?

13:15.044 --> 13:16.295
He just is.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.715
You've spent like five minutes with him.

13:19.799 --> 13:20.925
No, no, no.

13:21.091 --> 13:24.178
He always used to walk behind you
because he wanted to see what was coming,

13:24.261 --> 13:25.846
like all he wanted to do was protect you.

13:25.930 --> 13:26.806
And now

13:26.889 --> 13:28.057
we're following him.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.017
You haven't noticed?

13:31.852 --> 13:33.729
Look, he's been through a lot lately.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.148
I'm sure he'll get back to normal.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.237
Hey!

13:42.655 --> 13:43.489
What is it?

13:50.538 --> 13:53.290
Yeah, see. In the old days
he used to say, "Danger... Will--"

13:53.374 --> 13:54.708
Just stop!

13:56.293 --> 13:57.419
You don't know him.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.387
Come on. Mom's counting on us.

14:07.471 --> 14:08.472
We need to be ready.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.395
See?

14:20.484 --> 14:22.152
<i>I want to start by saying</i>

14:22.862 --> 14:25.155
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

14:25.614 --> 14:26.448
Good.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.534
Neither do we.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.411
You're a military man, John.

14:30.494 --> 14:33.372
You understand
once a situation like this escalates

14:33.539 --> 14:34.707
tension is heightened.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.417
Lines can be crossed.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.086
- I'm well aware.
-Then I need you...

14:39.253 --> 14:40.671
to ask Maureen

14:41.422 --> 14:42.756
to stand down.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.175
I won't do that.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.095
Judy, would you care to join us?

14:53.017 --> 14:55.519
Why don't we keep whatever this is
just between us?

14:57.521 --> 14:58.355
Good.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.357
Now we're all settled.

15:01.025 --> 15:04.528
I'd like to offer up
another interpretation

15:04.612 --> 15:06.071
of Maureen Robinson...

15:07.823 --> 15:10.910
as a woman who might
take things too far...

15:12.286 --> 15:14.496
in order to save her family.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.874
There is no taking things too far
when it comes to that.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.543
Even if it means breaking the law
to get them on board?

15:21.211 --> 15:23.047
What is he talking about, Dad?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.840
Honey, it's complicated.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.634
Mm. Not really.

15:27.134 --> 15:31.305
See, your mother arranged
for Will's test scores to be altered...

15:32.848 --> 15:34.767
so that he could qualify for the trip.

15:34.850 --> 15:38.187
I think my son has proven to everybody
that he deserves to be here.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.482
In fact, if it wasn't for him,
we'd have no chance of survival right now.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.234
So why don't you just say thank you
and get the hell off our Jupiter?

15:44.318 --> 15:47.488
You think because
you have control of a robot

15:47.613 --> 15:50.074
you can just do whatever you want

15:50.324 --> 15:51.241
on my ship?

15:52.076 --> 15:55.162
What if I were to tell you that
I have something more powerful

15:55.245 --> 15:57.831
than a robot that takes orders
from a child?

15:58.415 --> 15:59.249
You see,

15:59.333 --> 16:04.546
Maureen couldn't get access
to change Will's scores by herself.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.298
She had to make a deal.

16:06.548 --> 16:09.718
She had to trade something very valuable

16:09.802 --> 16:12.388
in order to complete her end
of the bargain.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.931
I don't believe you.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.350
How would you know that?

16:17.142 --> 16:19.186
Because the person she traded with...

16:21.939 --> 16:22.982
was me.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.318
That's our target.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.946
The ammonia belt. What's the depth?

16:29.029 --> 16:30.781
5,260 kilometers.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.409
It's about halfway through
the stratosphere.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.535
Polar orbit achieved.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.205
Okay, Radu,
open a ship-wide channel.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.250
<i>Attention, everyone. This is the bridge.</i>

16:41.917 --> 16:43.836
<i>Civilians, strap into your Jupiters.</i>

16:43.919 --> 16:45.713
<i>Crew, take your action stations.</i>

16:46.255 --> 16:49.258
<i>We're expecting high winds</i>
<i>and extreme turbulence.</i>

16:49.341 --> 16:51.844
<i>It will be a bumpy ride.</i>

17:08.110 --> 17:09.194
Initiate spin.

17:10.070 --> 17:13.240
Activating CMGS
and thruster engines now.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.003
Spin stabilization is set.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.379
Then we dive.

17:27.713 --> 17:33.093
Diving in three... two... one... Dive.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.971
<i>Descent initialized.</i>

18:06.126 --> 18:10.005
Correct for orbital perturbations.
Increase Delta-v by 20 percent.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.591
Sustained gas at 600 kilometers.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.803
Pressure increasing. 282 PSI.

18:19.181 --> 18:22.726
<i>Structural declension</i>
<i>detected on F deck, sector four.</i>

18:24.061 --> 18:26.230
Initiate emergency repair protocol.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.357
The <i>Resolute's</i> protocols aren't equipped
to handle this.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.609
It's a good thing we brought our own.

19:17.447 --> 19:20.325
<i>Ring four,</i>
<i>sector seven stabilized.</i>

19:24.288 --> 19:27.207
Leveling off.
We've reached a stable vector.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.011
This is definitely going in the book.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.649
You got lucky.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.738
You know,
I've made my share of mistakes...

19:58.739 --> 20:00.908
as a mother, as a wife,

20:00.991 --> 20:03.827
but one place I don't make mistakes
is my job.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.746
It wasn't luck.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.247
That was math.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.751
You're not the only one
who has to be perfect, Maureen.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.920
For this to work, everyone does.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.838
What are the odds of that?

20:16.506 --> 20:19.092
Maureen, they're prepping
the water tanks.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.094
We're in position to collect the gas.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.181
Open the intake vents.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.101
Time for a nice, deep breath of ammonia.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.373
Double check all the seals.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.959
That's a lot of pressure for these pipes.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.257
West, you and your cart are a hazard.
You wanna sit this one out?

20:58.340 --> 21:01.093
No, I don't want the others to think
I'm not pulling my weight.

21:02.803 --> 21:05.055
-Metaphorically speaking.
-If it makes you feel any better,

21:05.138 --> 21:08.141
whatever we do here isn't going to make up
for you deserting us the last time.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.477
Actually, that does not
make me feel any better.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.395
I'm staying.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.231
We'll be ready to process the water
in ten minutes.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.315
Great.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.150
OGS to bridge.

21:18.652 --> 21:21.405
This rust virus spreads like a disease.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.073
One drop spilled,

21:23.323 --> 21:26.076
one bead of condensation,
that's all it would take.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.246
I will not let Maureen

21:29.496 --> 21:30.455
risk this ship

21:30.539 --> 21:33.750
by releasing that contaminated water
into our system.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.878
You have to know that.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.463
What I know is this:

21:38.547 --> 21:41.758
if you had the ability to stop her,
you'd have done it by now.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.971
Judy, do you know which part
of the <i>Resolute's</i> design team

21:46.054 --> 21:48.056
-your mother was a part of?
-Don't answer him, Judy.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.100
-The safety system.
- That's right.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.519
And those systems play a crucial role

21:52.602 --> 21:54.271
in maintaining the stability

21:54.354 --> 21:57.941
of every dynamic function on this ship.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.277
Engineers like your mother,

22:00.360 --> 22:01.945
they perfect these systems

22:02.154 --> 22:03.196
by attacking them,

22:03.780 --> 22:04.948
infiltrating

22:05.324 --> 22:07.367
the <i>Resolute's </i>master controls

22:07.451 --> 22:08.785
to create conditions

22:08.869 --> 22:11.455
that would test the reactions
of their designs.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.874
Now, I'm sure your mother

22:14.750 --> 22:17.627
didn't think there was any harm
in giving me her access codes.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.922
After all, no one person
can run those tests on their own.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.759
It has to be agreed
by at least four people.

22:24.259 --> 22:26.595
Well, fortunately for me, everyone--

22:27.888 --> 22:30.557
Everyone has a weakness.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.558
No.

22:32.225 --> 22:34.436
My mother would never do that.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.645
Tell your wife

22:36.063 --> 22:37.147
to stand down

22:37.230 --> 22:38.857
or I will use those access codes,

22:38.940 --> 22:40.942
which she helped me obtain

22:41.443 --> 22:43.070
to open the OGS airlock.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.532
The atmosphere will flood the room.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.203
The pressure will be so intense,

22:51.536 --> 22:55.457
if anyone releases that water,
it will burst the pipes and vaporize...

22:56.083 --> 22:57.751
which means your plan will fail.

22:58.752 --> 23:01.171
And when we reach Alpha Centauri,
which we will,

23:01.922 --> 23:03.131
thanks to your robot,

23:04.091 --> 23:07.094
Maureen will be sent back to Earth
along with her son,

23:08.553 --> 23:11.264
and you will never see either
of them again.

23:17.312 --> 23:18.688
-Dad!

23:19.398 --> 23:21.233
-Dad.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.860
-Hey Dad!
-You soldiers are so predictable.

23:23.944 --> 23:27.447
The crews down in the OGS...
They'll die if you open the airlock.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.575
And whose fault would that be?

23:30.659 --> 23:32.452
No!

23:33.829 --> 23:34.871
No!

23:36.623 --> 23:38.333
<i>Manual override.</i>

23:48.593 --> 23:50.595
-The door won't open.
-Radio your mother.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.598
-Warn her what's coming.
-The comms are offline.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.145
Hastings must have shut them down.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.807
Hey, breathe, hey, hey, breathe.

24:37.684 --> 24:39.227
How are you going to protect me

24:39.311 --> 24:41.480
if you're hobbling around
on a broken ankle?

24:41.563 --> 24:43.231
Smith, get to the bridge.

24:43.899 --> 24:47.569
Tell Maureen Hastings has some kind
of skeleton key to the ship.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.154
So?

24:49.279 --> 24:50.780
He's gonna open the OGS airlock.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.782
Hurry, or people are gonna die.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.368
Get to the bridge, tell Maureen!

25:13.094 --> 25:15.931
Doctor Smith! Come here,
I want you to meet my mother.

25:26.358 --> 25:29.819
I'm showing all tanks are full,
but I can't raise the OGS.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.531
Communications are down.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.241
That's odd.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.669
Open the valves.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.171
Let's clean this water
and get out of here.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.925
- <i>Permissions declined.</i>
-What?

25:52.008 --> 25:53.260
We're locked out.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.053
That's not possible.

25:55.804 --> 25:56.846
What's going on?

25:58.723 --> 25:59.849
Maureen?

26:02.352 --> 26:03.436
Maureen, let me in.

26:16.783 --> 26:17.993
Maureen!

26:33.675 --> 26:36.177
-My God!
-We've gotta find the override!

26:36.261 --> 26:38.555
The OGS airlock is opening remotely.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.307
Oh, my God.

26:40.390 --> 26:43.977
Everybody out!
The airlock is opening!

26:51.359 --> 26:53.278
This place is about to get
real uncomfortable!

26:53.361 --> 26:54.362
Everybody out!

26:54.446 --> 26:56.323
Go! Go! Everybody get out!

26:56.406 --> 26:58.491
Move, move, move!

26:58.575 --> 26:59.784
We've gotta hurry! Come on!

26:59.868 --> 27:02.078
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

27:02.162 --> 27:04.831
No, take it. Take it, take it.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.794
Let's go! Everybody out!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

27:11.046 --> 27:13.590
Come on, come on, get out of here!
Go, go, go!

27:14.341 --> 27:16.051
Hurry! Go, go, go, go!

27:16.134 --> 27:17.761
Hurry! I can't hold it much longer!

27:17.844 --> 27:19.429
Is everyone out?

27:19.512 --> 27:20.555
Evacuate!

27:21.556 --> 27:23.558
-Come on, we gotta go!

27:24.059 --> 27:26.519
Go, go, go! We've gotta go!

27:26.603 --> 27:27.437
What is it?

27:27.520 --> 27:29.314
-I can't.
-Close your eyes, okay?

27:29.397 --> 27:30.231
You can do this.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.566
It's now or never!

27:36.613 --> 27:38.073
We have to get them out.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.160
On a positive note,

27:42.243 --> 27:43.620
my ankle feels much better.

27:46.539 --> 27:47.874
Pressure's building.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.751
Let's not waste time.

27:49.834 --> 27:53.171
In a few minutes, it's gonna be impossible
to get this door open.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.889
Danger... friend.

28:05.308 --> 28:06.643
What friend?

28:06.726 --> 28:08.812
Maureen, if you can hear me, let me in.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.022
Maureen...

28:12.774 --> 28:14.317
Why isn't anyone answering me?

28:14.526 --> 28:18.154
<i>Airlock malfunction.</i>
<i>Pressure loss in section three.</i>

28:18.238 --> 28:21.991
<i>All emergency personnel</i>
<i>please report to OGS module.</i>

28:23.368 --> 28:24.327
I'm too late.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.707
- Danger... friend.
-What?

28:29.708 --> 28:32.752
It's not gonna budge.
How long can they take in there?

28:32.836 --> 28:34.045
Not long enough.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.051
Hurry! They're back here.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.928
-Who?
-Don and Ava. They're dying.

28:42.011 --> 28:43.304
Oh, my God.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.932
-We can't get the door open.
-He can.

28:46.015 --> 28:49.102
- Danger... friend.
- Where is he going?

28:49.227 --> 28:50.395
Stop! You passed them!

28:50.520 --> 28:53.231
- Danger... friend.
-They're back there.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.775
What are you doing? They need your help.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.861
Danger... friend.

28:57.944 --> 28:59.654
Will, who is he talking about?

29:01.448 --> 29:02.449
I don't know.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.954
The pressure differential is sealing
the bulkhead door shut.

29:08.037 --> 29:10.415
It'll never open
as long as the airlock is open.

29:10.498 --> 29:13.376
Maureen, you helped design
the safety systems.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.962
How could someone remotely hack them
without your knowledge?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.089
They can't.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.034
The bridge is yours.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.161
Do me a favor.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.747
Send anyone looking for me away
from the maintenance pod bay.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.292
Any chance to save them, that airlock
needs to be closed from the outside.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.336
Too dangerous taking a pod out
in this atmosphere.

29:56.419 --> 29:58.421
It's my fault that they're trapped.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.173
You were right.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.593
Math can't account for human error.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.310
Hey, Don.

30:12.852 --> 30:13.686
Yeah?

30:13.770 --> 30:15.772
I think I'm gonna sit down for a second.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.066
Feeling pretty spacey.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.734
We are sitting down.

30:21.444 --> 30:22.278
I think.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.114
That's not good.

30:25.865 --> 30:29.619
Oh, hey, hey, no, no, no. Ava.
Come on. Come on. Up. Up, up, up.

30:29.702 --> 30:31.704
Come on. Open your eyes.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.290
Keep talking to me. Come on.<i> </i>Come on.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.627
You could have made it out.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.212
I don't know about that.

30:39.295 --> 30:41.256
I have serious mobility issues.

30:41.339 --> 30:44.467
There'd be a lot more of us stuck in here
if it wasn't for you.

30:44.717 --> 30:47.470
Well, if you want the job done at 70%,

30:48.388 --> 30:49.764
you call Don West.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.767
You had a choice.

30:53.434 --> 30:54.644
You chose us.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.570
That's good.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.016
Hold on, Don.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.601
No.

32:51.552 --> 32:52.720
Come on, come on.

33:01.854 --> 33:02.981
Come on!

33:10.321 --> 33:11.197
Okay.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.287
Okay.

33:48.484 --> 33:51.320
Okay...  Okay.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.539
Whoa, what's happening?

34:01.622 --> 34:03.583
Why is everything going back to normal?

34:06.127 --> 34:06.961
We lost.

34:09.255 --> 34:12.216
<i>Override terminated.</i>
<i>Controls restored.</i>

34:12.300 --> 34:14.427
Captain, comms are back online.

34:19.724 --> 34:20.600
We tried.

34:23.644 --> 34:27.356
Mr. Hastings, please.
You don't have to leave my family behind.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.484
You can let them go.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.111
We're not cruel.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.494
Permission to enter.

34:39.744 --> 34:41.454
Not that you need it, apparently.

34:43.456 --> 34:44.832
You have your ship back.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.626
Do I have you to thank?

34:46.709 --> 34:48.586
You give me too much credit.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.881
Let's go to Alpha Centauri.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.801
Not yet.

34:55.802 --> 34:56.636
First...

34:56.928 --> 34:59.138
we need to clean the water,
so we can all go.

34:59.722 --> 35:02.934
The captain I know
wouldn't risk this ship.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.019
It's not a risk.

35:07.939 --> 35:08.815
It's math.

35:18.032 --> 35:18.866
She did it.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.619
Yes!

35:22.662 --> 35:23.746
Thank you.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.715
<i>John, are you there?</i>

35:36.342 --> 35:37.677
Yeah. I'm here.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.803
<i>Are you okay?</i>

35:39.053 --> 35:39.887
<i>Where are you?</i>

35:40.054 --> 35:41.097
I'm fine.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.723
I'm in a maintenance pod.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.977
<i>-They're cleaning the water.</i>

35:47.145 --> 35:48.563
It all worked out, then.

35:49.188 --> 35:51.941
<i>-I told you you could trust her.</i>
<i>-</i>Who? Captain Kamal?

35:52.066 --> 35:53.025
<i>No, Smith.</i>

35:53.109 --> 35:55.236
I told her to come warn you
about Hastings.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.738
What are you talking about?
I never saw her.

35:57.822 --> 36:00.950
<i>The whole reason I'm out here</i>
<i>is to fix what Hastings did.</i>

36:04.036 --> 36:04.871
Where are you now?

36:04.954 --> 36:06.497
I'm headed for bay six.

36:06.831 --> 36:07.999
<i>I'll come and meet you.</i>

36:14.088 --> 36:15.006
John.

36:15.256 --> 36:18.426
-I was coming back to get you out.
-Why didn't you warn Maureen?

36:19.135 --> 36:20.845
I got there as fast as I could.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.138
No, you had plenty of time.

36:22.930 --> 36:24.515
I had to take a detour.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.559
Detour? Why?

36:26.726 --> 36:27.643
I don't know.

36:27.727 --> 36:28.895
You don't know.

36:29.145 --> 36:29.979
Hm? That's it?

36:30.062 --> 36:32.190
You're not even gonna try
and spin some excuse?

36:32.815 --> 36:34.400
I tried to warn her.

36:35.985 --> 36:37.236
You have to believe me.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.572
I did believe you. I did.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.365
But I should have known better

36:41.490 --> 36:43.743
than to actually think
that you could change.

36:46.746 --> 36:47.872
I tried.

36:48.247 --> 36:49.290
<i>-</i>
-Hey.

36:49.373 --> 36:52.793
You know why
I like to give people second chances?

36:52.877 --> 36:54.712
Because after all the terrible,

36:54.795 --> 36:57.506
terrible things that I've seen people
do to each other,

36:57.590 --> 37:00.760
I have to believe that
there's a road back for all of us.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.972
You found my weakness.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.224
Well done.

37:18.277 --> 37:19.820
Danger... friend.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.412
-Will, we shouldn't be in here--
- Shh.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.831
Increase voltage.
It's trying to get out.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.126
Stay there.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.048
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is it?

37:39.131 --> 37:40.675
Wait, no.

37:40.758 --> 37:41.592
Will?

37:42.426 --> 37:44.887
Keep your distance. Call for backup.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.098
-What's he doing?
-Will.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.111
What's he doing?

38:00.194 --> 38:01.487
No, Robot!

38:01.570 --> 38:03.864
- No! Don't hurt them!

38:22.341 --> 38:24.135
Look at Scarecrow's lights.

38:24.552 --> 38:25.886
I've seen this before.

38:30.433 --> 38:31.392
He's dying.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.814
Will, I think your robot's angry.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.527
Will. Will. Will...

38:41.819 --> 38:42.903
It's okay.

38:47.491 --> 38:48.326
Hey.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.999
I'm sorry about what happened
to your friend.

38:55.750 --> 38:56.667
I really am.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.312
Wait.

39:16.687 --> 39:17.521
Hey.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.481
Where are you going?

39:18.981 --> 39:20.983
Will, is he leaving?

39:22.318 --> 39:23.277
We need you.

39:23.652 --> 39:25.237
You need to help us get home.

39:30.910 --> 39:33.579
No, Will Robinson.
