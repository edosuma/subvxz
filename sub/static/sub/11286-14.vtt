00:01.388 --> 00:02.775
Forget about it, Synclaire.

00:02.842 --> 00:05.442
I do not wanna go ice skating
this weekend.

00:05.509 --> 00:08.775
Still got bruises
from the last time we went.

00:08.842 --> 00:09.975
You'd reduce the swelling

00:10.042 --> 00:12.975
if you just stayed on
the ice when you fall.

00:13.042 --> 00:14.109
Give it up, girl.

00:14.175 --> 00:15.609
Khadijah is living proof

00:15.675 --> 00:17.709
that some people just
aren't meant to balance

00:17.775 --> 00:21.842
on two little blades.

00:21.909 --> 00:24.942
And you're living proof that
two little blades do not..

00:25.009 --> 00:28.375
...a moustache clear.

00:28.442 --> 00:30.475
Mornin', ladies. Sweet Pea.

00:30.542 --> 00:35.109
Hi, Obie.

00:35.175 --> 00:37.975
Oh, Obie. You look exhausted.

00:38.042 --> 00:40.542
Girl, I didn't get
a wink of sleep last night.

00:40.609 --> 00:44.175
Was Kyle singin' opera
in his sleep again?

00:44.242 --> 00:46.242
And I learned
to ignore all of that.

00:46.309 --> 00:48.042
But, since I was up, I figured

00:48.109 --> 00:50.075
I'd make you all new
mailbox labels.

00:50.142 --> 00:52.842
Each one is a brass plate
with your name engraved

00:52.909 --> 00:57.309
in beautiful
old fashioned script.

00:57.375 --> 01:02.315

Khadijah, I was wondering

01:44.149 --> 01:46.382
if you had a chance
to read my article.

01:46.449 --> 01:48.182
Synclaire,
you just gave it to me.

01:48.249 --> 01:51.215
Eight months ago.
It's gonna go stale.

01:51.282 --> 01:54.415
How can an article called
"What makes dogs so great"

01:54.482 --> 01:57.282
ever go stale?

01:57.349 --> 01:59.582
Aren't you supposed to be
getting Sheri's desk ready?

01:59.649 --> 02:00.622
Already done.

02:00.689 --> 02:04.989
The under side of the desk
is now gum‐free.

02:05.055 --> 02:06.789
Can't wait
for Sheri to get here.

02:06.855 --> 02:08.455
Back then, we were so tight

02:08.521 --> 02:11.622
they used to call us
"Hey, you two."

02:11.689 --> 02:14.089
And if I know her..

02:14.155 --> 02:17.122
...she'll be writing
at that desk 24 hours a day.

02:17.188 --> 02:19.122
Boom. I'm here.

02:19.188 --> 02:21.655
[laughing]

02:21.722 --> 02:23.689
Khadijah.

02:23.755 --> 02:26.155
What's up, girl?

02:26.222 --> 02:27.789
Sheri, loud as ever.

02:27.855 --> 02:30.755
Yeah, well.
To hear me is to love me.

02:30.822 --> 02:32.122
How you doing?

02:32.189 --> 02:33.922
‐ You wanna show me around?
‐ Sure.

02:33.989 --> 02:36.855
Well...this is it.

02:36.922 --> 02:40.655
Yeah? Well, I won't get lost.

02:40.722 --> 02:42.722
Is this your office? Very nice.

02:42.789 --> 02:46.255
A nice sense of semi‐privacy.

02:46.322 --> 02:47.922
Hi, Sheri. I'm Synclaire.

02:47.989 --> 02:52.289
The cousin with the hairy feet.

02:52.355 --> 02:53.455
You told.

02:53.522 --> 02:55.255
We used a picture of your feet

02:55.322 --> 02:58.789
for our eighth grade
science project.

02:58.855 --> 03:01.195
It was in the name of science.

03:01.262 --> 03:05.029
Well, for the greater good.

03:05.095 --> 03:08.962
What a sport.
I would've kicked your ass.

03:09.029 --> 03:11.129
Sheri, it'll be so great
having you here.

03:11.195 --> 03:12.462
Just like high school.

03:12.529 --> 03:15.495
‐ And by that, I mean the pay.
‐ Hey, don't sweat it.

03:15.562 --> 03:18.295
I figure Khadijah's my girl.
She's got her own magazine.

03:18.362 --> 03:21.662
I'm currently unemployed.
I'll give it a shot.

03:21.729 --> 03:24.529
Now, look. I know you're used
to giving your bosses crap.

03:24.595 --> 03:27.329
But you're not just my employee,
you're my friend.

03:27.395 --> 03:29.062
So I expect double the crap.

03:29.129 --> 03:30.395
You can count on it.

03:30.462 --> 03:32.362
Hey. Is that a zit?

03:32.429 --> 03:35.395
Ha ha. Got ya'.

03:35.462 --> 03:37.529
Where's my desk?
I wanna get to work.

03:37.595 --> 03:40.562
You hear that, Synclaire?
She wants to get to work.

03:40.629 --> 03:43.529
Yeah. You and I will
catch up at lunch, right?

03:43.595 --> 03:45.962
No, I can't.
I gotta edit some stories.

03:46.029 --> 03:47.262
Why don't you take Synclaire?

03:47.329 --> 03:49.062
It's easy to get her to laugh

03:49.129 --> 03:51.829
and make her blow
soda out of her nose.

03:51.895 --> 03:53.262
You know, I love that.

03:53.329 --> 03:55.062
There's a new restaurant
that just opened

03:55.129 --> 03:57.329
down the street.
It is traditional Japanese.

03:57.395 --> 03:58.562
I don't know.

03:58.629 --> 04:01.869
I don't think I wanna
see your feet while I'm eatin'.

04:01.935 --> 04:04.902
I don't wanna see
my feet when I'm eatin'.

04:09.669 --> 04:11.735
Alright. Who wants some coffee?

04:11.802 --> 04:14.302
None for me, thanks.

04:14.369 --> 04:16.101
Overton, have you
been here all night?

04:16.168 --> 04:19.802
Well, not in that one spot. No.

04:19.869 --> 04:23.135
But, I polished your pipes,
organized your cleaning products

04:23.202 --> 04:24.735
and installed
some teak paneling

04:24.802 --> 04:27.502
in case company
looks down there.

04:27.569 --> 04:29.035
What has been keeping you up?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.402
There's only two things
that can cause a man

04:31.469 --> 04:33.135
not to sleep for three days.

04:33.202 --> 04:35.468
Heartache or career crises.

04:35.535 --> 04:39.769
You kiddin'? Synclaire and I
are closer than jelly on toast.

04:39.835 --> 04:41.669
Hell, I got the dream job.

04:41.735 --> 04:44.402
Oh sure, I don't have
my own show on TV

04:44.469 --> 04:49.602
like some handymen but,
don't keep me up at night.

04:49.669 --> 04:52.402
Then, you sick, man.

04:52.469 --> 04:55.035
Overton, have you tried
some sort of a sleep aid?

04:55.102 --> 04:56.702
Girl, I tried 'em all.

04:56.769 --> 05:03.042
"Sleepex", "Snoozafan Plus",
"Maximum Strefsnoresin".

05:03.109 --> 05:08.142
Even tried the generic brand
"Go To Sleep."

05:08.209 --> 05:10.775
Well, Overton, I once read
that really vigorous work

05:10.842 --> 05:12.575

05:12.642 --> 05:13.975
‐ Yeah?
‐ 'Yeah.'

05:14.042 --> 05:16.542
And I need a new fireplace
front. Y'know, nothin' fancy.

besides the genetic stuff?

Okay, Khadijah
wants some plain.

06:32.582 --> 06:35.282
Yeah, I know.

06:37.349 --> 06:41.649
What's wrong with plain?

06:41.715 --> 06:44.215
When writing an article,
I should never begin a sentence

06:44.282 --> 06:45.515
with "and", "but" or "or".

06:45.582 --> 06:47.582
Exactly.
They're all conjunctions.

That many steps, to get from
the chair to the fridge.

09:28.635 --> 09:29.702
Eight regular steps.

09:29.769 --> 09:32.002
As opposed to baby steps
which as everyone knows

09:32.069 --> 09:33.802
is a quarter of a regular step.

09:33.869 --> 09:35.102
Then you got giant steps.

09:35.169 --> 09:37.169

as a regular step.

was fine, physically

probably...psychological.

from my apartment here.

You're still awake. Excellent.

10:21.109 --> 10:23.642

in a new steam shower.

10:23.709 --> 10:26.775

five, six, seven, eight..

10:37.042 --> 10:39.875
I better go. You know,
this morning I found him outside

10:49.142 --> 10:51.875
She know the rules.
Her man, her problem.

10:51.942 --> 10:55.109
She stayed late at the office
to help Sheri with research.

10:55.175 --> 10:57.642
Hmm. They've been hangin' out
together lately a lot.

10:57.709 --> 10:59.475
Yeah. When did
they get so tight?

I encouraged it. I think it's
great. My cousin. My friend.

11:04.049 --> 11:06.549
I'm‐I'm really happy about it.

11:06.615 --> 11:09.549
Now, shut up and let me
watch this TV show.

11:09.615 --> 11:13.082
Aw. Is Khadijah
missing Synclaire?

11:13.149 --> 11:14.315
No.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.715
Stop lyin'.

11:16.782 --> 11:20.115
Well, don't be sad.
We'll fill in for her.

11:20.182 --> 11:23.682
What's buzzin', cousin?
Ha ha ha.

11:23.749 --> 11:24.982
Ching‐tac‐tac‐tac.

11:25.049 --> 11:28.349
‐ O‐o‐o‐o.
‐ Woh‐woh‐woh. Woh‐woh‐woh.

11:29.815 --> 11:33.115
Y'all are wrong.
Oh, good golly, dead wrong.

11:33.182 --> 11:35.749
I live with her.
I work with her.

11:35.815 --> 11:39.249
I don't miss Synclaire.

11:39.315 --> 11:40.515
Hey, Synclaire.

11:40.582 --> 11:43.082
Wanna go to the movies?
Just the two of us?

11:43.149 --> 11:44.782
‐ Well, I‐‐
‐ I'm such a pushover.

11:44.849 --> 11:48.682
I always get "The Watchtower"
and "The Wake."

11:48.749 --> 11:49.882
Hey, Dij.

11:49.949 --> 11:54.349
‐ Hey, Sher.
‐ Oh, so you popped that zit.

11:54.415 --> 11:55.715
What're you doing?

11:55.782 --> 11:58.082
‐ We're going ice‐skating.
‐ Yeah, why don't you come with?

11:58.149 --> 12:00.322
Oh, Khadijah doesn't skate,
she falls.

12:00.389 --> 12:01.555
Oh, yeah?

12:01.622 --> 12:02.922
I plan on falling.

12:02.989 --> 12:06.022
But I'm gonna take a whole lot
of people down with me.

12:06.089 --> 12:09.889
No, you guys go ahead.
I'll see you when you come back.

12:09.955 --> 12:11.922
‐ Alright.
‐ Okay, suit yourself.

12:11.989 --> 12:13.289
(Synclaire)
'No, never.'

12:15.255 --> 12:16.555
[horse neighing]

12:18.222 --> 12:21.055
Oh, the potato crop failed.

12:29.911 --> 12:31.844
Hey, Khadijah,
before you say anything

12:31.911 --> 12:33.544
it's my fault
that Synclaire's late.

12:33.611 --> 12:35.078
Oh, it's cool.

12:35.144 --> 12:36.244
It is?

12:36.311 --> 12:39.411
Sure! What's 20 minutes
between cousins?

12:39.478 --> 12:41.944
Sounds like a pick‐up line
at a hillbilly bar.

12:44.244 --> 12:45.911
Well, no time
for lollygagging

12:45.978 --> 12:48.478
I feel the inspiration
for a new article coming on.

12:48.544 --> 12:50.611
"Cats our cuddly buddies."

12:52.211 --> 12:53.744
Hey, what's this?

12:53.811 --> 12:56.544
Well, I read your first article
and I really enjoyed it

12:56.611 --> 12:59.878
so, as a reward, I thought I'd
give you a little more privacy.

12:59.944 --> 13:04.051
Oh, yeah? Do I get a ceiling
and a door for my next story?

13:04.118 --> 13:05.418
I'll give you wet naps

13:05.484 --> 13:08.284
you can pretend like you
have a sink in your office.

13:12.051 --> 13:14.651
Yo, Sheri!

13:14.718 --> 13:16.651
You ever get that
sinking feeling?

13:18.518 --> 13:20.951
That's good.
That's funny. Ha ha ha.

13:28.484 --> 13:31.151
Khadijah, are you okay?

13:31.218 --> 13:34.851
Fine. Just tryin' to get work
done in my place of business.

13:34.918 --> 13:37.751
Can't all have
as much fun as you two.

13:37.818 --> 13:41.351
Hmm, Khadijah, why don't you
come hang out with us tonight?

13:41.418 --> 13:44.051
No, I'm sure you
two have your plans.

13:44.118 --> 13:48.584
Come on, Khadijah, don't be
such a Stacy "Stick in the Mud."

13:48.651 --> 13:50.651
We'll do anything you like.

13:50.718 --> 13:52.651
Don't do me any favors.

13:52.718 --> 13:54.851
There are plenty
of things I can do.

13:57.484 --> 13:59.551
We could play Clue.

13:59.618 --> 14:02.858
‐ What the hell is that?
‐ Her favorite board game.

14:02.924 --> 14:04.958
Clue's good!
We love clue.

14:05.024 --> 14:06.358
(Sheri)
'We're playing Clue.'

14:06.424 --> 14:08.358
Tonight,
I can hardly wait.

14:08.424 --> 14:10.391
What the hell
did I get myself into?

14:10.458 --> 14:13.458
It's a murder mystery game where
you guess who the murderer is

14:13.524 --> 14:14.858
with what weapon and where.

14:14.924 --> 14:16.858
Reminds me of Jersey.

14:18.324 --> 14:19.624
[both giggling]

14:24.424 --> 14:25.691
Alright.

14:25.758 --> 14:28.258
Now, you may have pulled
the wool over the eyes

14:28.324 --> 14:31.958
of the Scotland Yard boys,
Miss Scarlet, but not me.

14:32.024 --> 14:34.024
Oh, come on,
give us all a break.

14:34.091 --> 14:36.024
It's called Clue,
not moron.

14:37.724 --> 14:39.658
What was that?
What was..

14:39.724 --> 14:42.324
Oh, it was just the hounds
baying at the moon.

14:44.058 --> 14:47.058
Anyway, I'm going to ferret the
truth out of you, Miss Scarlet

14:47.124 --> 14:48.591
or my name isn't
Colonel Mustard.

14:48.658 --> 14:51.158
Now, I propose it was you..

14:51.224 --> 14:55.691
...who killed him, in the
conservatory, with the knife.

14:55.758 --> 14:59.898
I declare, Colonel Mustard,
are you accusin' me of murder?

14:59.964 --> 15:02.164
Ah! I swoon!

15:03.598 --> 15:04.898
I puke!

15:06.664 --> 15:09.431
Okay. Synclaire, your turn.

15:09.498 --> 15:11.431
I'm gonna guess who
the murderer is.

15:11.498 --> 15:12.798
But you have no evidence.

15:12.864 --> 15:14.998
Don't need evidence,
I had a vision.

15:17.364 --> 15:21.731
It's Professor Plum,
in the dining room, with a rope.

15:24.231 --> 15:26.164
And I am out.

15:26.231 --> 15:28.164
Don't sweat it,
come, we'll be partners.

15:28.231 --> 15:30.164
No. There are no partners.

15:30.231 --> 15:32.531
Besides, she just saw
who the murderer was.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.564
Yahtzee!

15:38.464 --> 15:41.298
Overton, man,
we're playing Clue.

15:41.364 --> 15:44.464
‐ I'm gonna get some snacks.
‐ Yeah, you got any fruit?

15:44.531 --> 15:46.931
Yeah, we have apples,
oranges, plums.

15:46.998 --> 15:48.031
Plum sounds good.

15:48.098 --> 15:50.031
Hey, whoa, whoa, hold up.

15:50.098 --> 15:51.131
What was that?

15:51.198 --> 15:52.164
What?

15:52.231 --> 15:54.564
You goin' to the kitchen
for a plum?

15:54.631 --> 15:57.664
Professor Plum? Oh and I suppose
you're cutting it with a knife?

15:57.731 --> 16:00.071
You're tryin' to give her
the answer. You're cheating.

16:01.438 --> 16:04.604
Lighten up, she was just
taking my food order.

16:04.671 --> 16:06.704
Of course,
you're gonna defend her.

16:06.771 --> 16:08.138
Khadijah, stop trippin'.

16:08.204 --> 16:09.671
No, no, no,
I heard them.

16:09.738 --> 16:11.038
Plum, knife, kitchen.

16:11.104 --> 16:15.071
Doesn't it bother you that some
people are trying to get over?

16:15.138 --> 16:17.371
What bothers me is
when you're in the mood

16:17.438 --> 16:19.171
we have to play
this dumb game.

16:19.238 --> 16:21.171
Synclaire,
get me a cantaloupe.

16:22.871 --> 16:25.338
I cannot believe you'd
accuse us of cheating.

16:25.404 --> 16:27.638
Oh, forget about it, Synclaire.
She's on to us.

16:27.704 --> 16:29.671
I mean, it's been fun
roaming the country

16:29.738 --> 16:32.638
pulling one clue scam
after another.

16:32.704 --> 16:34.871
But look, we finally
met our match.

16:34.938 --> 16:36.938
[laughing]

16:37.004 --> 16:40.438
Alright, now look,
I've been playing this game

16:40.504 --> 16:43.304
since I was a kid,
and never have I seen someone

16:43.371 --> 16:47.571
who just had to have fruit,
in the middle of the game.

16:47.638 --> 16:51.004
Well, I will not be a part
of this mockery of Clue!

16:54.138 --> 16:55.438
[laughing]

16:57.104 --> 16:59.171
She is really mad.

16:59.238 --> 17:01.178
I don't think
she's coming back.

17:01.244 --> 17:03.178
Let's look at her cards.

17:03.244 --> 17:04.978
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.

17:05.044 --> 17:06.978
Let's just play the game.
Who's next?

17:07.978 --> 17:08.944
Gin.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.544
Khadijah,
we need to talk.

17:18.611 --> 17:21.711
I'm in no mood for any
of your heart‐to‐hearts.

17:21.778 --> 17:23.211
Woo‐woo‐woo.
Woo‐woo‐woo.

17:23.278 --> 17:25.877
Don't..."woo‐woo‐woo" me.

17:29.978 --> 17:32.978
Okay, maybe you and Sheri
weren't cheatin'.

17:33.044 --> 17:35.211
Clue brings out
the worst in me.

17:35.278 --> 17:36.244
Bye.

17:38.278 --> 17:41.344
So does Monopoly, Scrabble,
Trouble, Candy Land, Jacks

17:41.411 --> 17:45.078
Operation, Life. Ah! This is not
about your poor sportsmanship.

17:46.378 --> 17:49.078
Ever since Sheri showed up,
you've been pouty

17:49.144 --> 17:52.178
touchy, and I'm gonna come
right out and say it, snippy.

17:54.711 --> 17:57.244
Well, maybe that's
because the two of you

17:57.311 --> 18:00.751
been acting like two
gossipy giggly little girls.

18:00.818 --> 18:04.784
‐ And what's wrong with that?
‐ It's immature. It's stupid.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.684
It used to be us.

18:08.551 --> 18:09.918
You're jealous.

18:09.984 --> 18:11.551
I am not.

18:11.618 --> 18:14.384
I don't like y'all acting
as if you like each other

18:14.451 --> 18:16.518
more than you like me.

18:16.584 --> 18:18.918
"Sheri, show me
how to organize slides."

18:18.984 --> 18:20.918
"Sheri, read my article."

18:21.751 --> 18:23.751
I know what a conjunction is.

18:25.884 --> 18:28.918
Khadijah,
that is just so petty.

18:28.984 --> 18:31.651
And it's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

18:34.218 --> 18:36.151
Yeah, well, get over it.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.918
Na‐ah, I'm savoring
this moment.

18:39.984 --> 18:41.918
You haven't paid me
this much attention

18:41.984 --> 18:45.351
since I almost
burned down Flavor.

18:45.418 --> 18:47.351
It wasn't the kinda
attention I wanted

18:47.418 --> 18:49.351
but still
you were focused.

18:49.418 --> 18:51.751
I always pay attention to you.

18:51.818 --> 18:53.751
Uh, not like it
used to be.

18:53.818 --> 18:55.784
Remember when I first
moved to New York

18:55.851 --> 18:57.851
and‐and we'd go
to the Knicks games

18:57.918 --> 19:01.758
and you would yell at Spike Lee,
"Sit down, shorty!"

19:01.824 --> 19:05.524
And after he turned around
you'd point to me like I did it.

19:05.591 --> 19:08.124
Those were the days,
we need to do that again.

19:08.191 --> 19:10.191
I bet you,
I could get you arrested.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.258
That would be nice.

19:14.358 --> 19:15.791
Hey, sorry to interrupt

19:15.858 --> 19:18.358
but your friend Kyle just
started using a Russian accent.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.524
I had to get outta there.

19:20.591 --> 19:22.858
Look, Sheri,
I'm sorry I went off.

19:22.924 --> 19:24.891
Hey, you were trying
to solve a murder.

19:24.958 --> 19:27.924
Anyone could crack
under the pressure.

19:27.991 --> 19:32.358
Listen, it seems my being here
is affecting your relationship.

19:32.424 --> 19:36.424
And, uh, I'm thinking it's for
the best I don't work at Flavor.

19:36.491 --> 19:38.424
Oh, Sheri,
it's not your fault.

19:38.491 --> 19:40.991
I mean, Synclaire and I
had a couple of problems

19:41.058 --> 19:42.991
but I think
we worked them out.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.291
Well, damn, I'll have
to tell you the truth.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.291
Alright, I got my first
paycheck today

19:47.358 --> 19:49.858
and I know you warned me
it's small, but girl..

19:49.924 --> 19:51.858
...if I had a cat, I'd starve.

19:53.591 --> 19:55.824
You know, I don't wanna
leave you hanging here

19:55.891 --> 19:58.624
but I think I'm gonna have
to go back to freelancin'.

19:58.691 --> 20:00.564
Well, I'm sorry
to see you go.

20:00.631 --> 20:03.664
That's it? No crying?
No pleading? No begging to stay?

20:04.864 --> 20:06.864
‐ Sheri, stay?
‐ I can't, I can't.

20:08.131 --> 20:10.631
But I would like to take
that wall with me.

20:10.698 --> 20:12.698
So I can remember
all the good times.

20:14.498 --> 20:18.198
Khadijah, you made us play the
game, come and take your turn.

20:18.264 --> 20:20.298
Bump that, I wanna know
what's goin' on.

20:20.364 --> 20:22.298
Everything's fine,
Khadijah apologized.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.598
Damn!
No bloodbath?

20:25.664 --> 20:28.677
No, sorry. It's a regular
love fest up here.

20:28.744 --> 20:30.677
We were about to drink
international coffees

20:30.744 --> 20:32.044
and watch "Steel Magnolias".

20:33.744 --> 20:39.077
Good! Now, comrades,
let us get back to game, huh?

20:39.144 --> 20:42.744
‐ I'm about to solve crime.
‐ Yeah? I'm about to commit one.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.177
[all cheering]

20:49.677 --> 20:52.810
You know, Khadijah, your
box‐spring is pretty squeaky.

20:54.010 --> 20:56.477
My old box‐spring
was pretty squeaky.

20:56.544 --> 21:01.584
Then I got a new one a couple
of days ago, ain't heard a peep.

21:01.650 --> 21:04.050
The squeaky sound
is kinda soothing though.

21:07.284 --> 21:08.650
Overton?

21:08.717 --> 21:10.450
Good for him.

21:10.517 --> 21:12.684
You know, I'm gonna miss
his random babbling.

21:14.984 --> 21:18.217
Oh, look at him sleeping
like a new born baby.

21:18.284 --> 21:19.250
[snorting]

21:20.417 --> 21:22.417
Ooh, drool and everything.

21:27.950 --> 21:30.350
Obie sweetie, wake up.

21:31.417 --> 21:33.517
Wake up.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.584
Wake up!

21:45.050 --> 21:47.650
Hell, it ain't my bed,
you know what I'm saying?

21:49.784 --> 21:51.084
Obie!

21:52.784 --> 21:54.084
Obie!

21:55.817 --> 21:57.984
Come on, man,
it's time to clear out.

22:00.017 --> 22:03.057
You ain't gonna keep my bear.
You ain't gonna keep my bear!

22:16.486 --> 22:18.486
Guess you
can keep the bear.

22:24.086 --> 22:25.186
Woo‐hoo!

22:25.253 --> 22:26.220
[giggling]
