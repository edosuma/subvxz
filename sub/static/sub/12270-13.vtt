00:00.080 --> 00:02.000
Previously on Evermoor Chronicles.

00:02.120 --> 00:05.400
You must give us three Fated villagers
to inhabit.

00:05.520 --> 00:07.360
Where is the third?

00:07.480 --> 00:10.920
You have been found guilty of the theft
of the Grand Tapestry.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.320
You have until sundown tomorrow
to gather your possessions and leave.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.680
Can't banish you
if they have the tapestry.

00:18.840 --> 00:21.360
I hated the Circle King,
but I didn't want this.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.840
It was the right thing.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.520
This lantern
was repaired with imbued thread.

00:25.680 --> 00:29.040
Those who touch it who aren’t Fated,
the lantern will hurt them.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.840
Stay away from the lantern!

00:32.520 --> 00:34.000
Otto!

00:36.800 --> 00:40.200
# I left my friends for my new life

00:40.400 --> 00:43.480
# How will I know it's gonna be alright?

00:43.640 --> 00:50.160
# I got to take control
And write my destiny

00:50.360 --> 00:53.040
# The future's still untold

00:53.200 --> 00:55.480
# Nobody else can see

00:55.600 --> 01:01.400
# If this will be
For Evermoor #

01:01.520 --> 01:04.680
# EVERMOOR CHRONICLES #

01:07.200 --> 01:08.680
Otto?

01:08.880 --> 01:10.880
# VALENTINA #

01:12.840 --> 01:16.680
Otto! Otto, speak to me!

01:20.000 --> 01:23.160
The Sacred Snoot! What have you done?

01:27.520 --> 01:28.880
Our third sister?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.560
No. This is something else.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
(SHIMMERING)

01:43.040 --> 01:45.520
Earth, right?

01:45.680 --> 01:50.480
I am so ready for Earth.
Now where is my Snoot?

01:50.640 --> 01:52.760
He went that way, my dear.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.800
Is that who I think it is?

01:57.960 --> 02:02.680
That is our opportunity to finally free
our third sister,

02:02.880 --> 02:05.280
without interruption.

02:05.440 --> 02:09.080
I must gather the circle
for one final meeting.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.920
Well, thanks a bundle, Mayor Doyle!

02:15.040 --> 02:18.320
I can’t believe your dad’s going through
with the banishment!

02:18.480 --> 02:20.520
My father offers a removal service...?

02:20.680 --> 02:23.440
I’m sorry, he made me.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.480
We’re going to be out of here by sundown.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.560
-This is insane.
-Guys!

02:31.760 --> 02:33.680
Otto knows where the tapestry is.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.160
He can clear Tara?

02:35.360 --> 02:37.800
He walks to Mayor Doyle,
she’s in the clear.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.000
Tiny problem with that.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.360
This is Otto.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.400
Seriously,do you plan on turning every boy
in Evermoor into an inanimate object?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
(WIND CHIME SOUND)

02:51.120 --> 02:55.480
What if you convinced Mayor Doyle
that you had to stay

02:55.600 --> 02:59.320
by turning into an A student.
Then he’d have to let you all stay.

02:59.480 --> 03:03.320
I can barely understand you,
let alone Evermoorian schoolwork.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.880
That’s why I’ve got help.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.600
Meet Aristotle,
the biggest genius in Evermoor.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.840
He’s given me
advice since I was a kid.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.360
-That explains so much.
-Ask him a question.

03:19.480 --> 03:23.360
(ARISTOTLE CLOPS)
What’s the capital of Mongolia?

03:24.360 --> 03:25.480
Ulan Bator.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.280
Wait, all he did was just tap his hoof!

03:28.440 --> 03:31.560
I’ve always been able to understand
exactly what he means.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.160
Ulan Bator. That’s right.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.760
So you...

03:36.920 --> 03:39.560
I mean he can fix all my assignments?

03:39.760 --> 03:42.960
-Just so we all can stay?
-That’s the plan.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.640
He says it was his idea.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.080
The lantern did this to him?

03:50.280 --> 03:53.440
Yeah! And there’s only one Founder
left in there!

03:53.560 --> 03:56.440
Two Founders are out.
We must do something.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.200
If we don’t fix Otto we won’t be do
anything except being banished.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.880
Otto?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.560
Otto, I don’t know if you can hear me,
but hang in there, pal.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.480
We're trying to find a way to...

04:08.640 --> 04:11.480
Well, the banishment is hard on us all.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.640
Two hours until sundown, Tara.

04:19.840 --> 04:24.080
All I’m asking is a way to change a statue
into a person. Come on.

04:24.280 --> 04:27.920
We will find a way.
I mean, you kissed me back to life.

04:28.040 --> 04:31.280
-You smooching is not the answer--
-Love solves everything.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.560
-Ancient Magic.
-What we gonna do, kiss Otto back to life?

04:35.760 --> 04:42.120
Whoever’s thinking about planting one
on my Snoot, hands off.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.320
Oh, good.
What we needed today was a bit more crazy.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.480
Who are you?

04:48.600 --> 04:51.160
What are they teaching
you in school these days?

04:51.360 --> 04:55.360
The name Valentina ring any bells?

04:55.480 --> 05:00.000
As in Valentina, Demigoddess of Love?

05:00.160 --> 05:02.640
-That’s not possible.
-You can’t be real.

05:02.840 --> 05:08.480
Oh, I’m as real as the dimples
on your face.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.680
Oh, what have these humans done to you?

05:16.320 --> 05:18.800
(THUD)

05:18.960 --> 05:20.000
Who is that?

05:20.120 --> 05:23.680
Valentina, the demigoddess
who brought love to the people of Earth.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.280
And Snoot’s great romance!

05:25.440 --> 05:30.360
The Snoot seems to be a little less chatty
than I remember.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.000
Which is why I’m here.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.480
To save him. Of course!

05:34.640 --> 05:37.280
Yeah, like what Sorsha said!
The Ancient Magic!

05:38.280 --> 05:41.120
If you’re his great love,
all you have to do is kiss!

05:41.320 --> 05:43.560
And he’ll be just like he was before!

05:43.760 --> 05:47.560
Yeah. That’s not going to happen.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.080
No!

05:51.000 --> 05:53.320
That’s all you’ve caught
since chicken pox.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.760
-Run!
-No! No! That Snoot’s mine!

05:55.920 --> 05:58.040
Mine to break into a million pieces!

05:58.200 --> 06:02.480
(DOOR CREAKS THEN DOOR CRASH CLOSE)

06:03.520 --> 06:08.920
As if I’m going to let a door come between
me and my revenge on that dirt bag owl.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.680
You’re not getting him. Right, Bella?

06:11.880 --> 06:15.400
Oh, sure, bring me into the fight
with the all-powerful entity!

06:15.520 --> 06:20.000
You know how long I’ve waited
to get my paws on that fleabag?

06:20.120 --> 06:21.480
One thousand years.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.360
You’re the demigoddess of love!

06:23.480 --> 06:25.000
Love is for losers.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
The demigoddess of love
doesn’t believe in love anymore?

06:29.120 --> 06:30.640
What’s wrong with you?

06:30.840 --> 06:35.000
Sure, we were happy demigods once.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.560
Me, spreading love and affection.

06:37.760 --> 06:42.360
Him, picking parasites from his pelt
and regurgitating pellets.

06:42.480 --> 06:46.760
-Good times.
-Then he broke up with me, no explanation!

06:46.920 --> 06:49.200
-What? Otto?
-He just disappeared!

06:49.400 --> 06:52.400
Centuries later,
I found out he was here on Earth!

06:52.520 --> 06:55.400
But when I tried to follow, guess what?

06:55.520 --> 06:58.880
-That pigeon put an exclusion spell on me.
-An ex-what now?

06:59.000 --> 07:04.560
As long as he was on Earth, I couldn’t be.

07:04.760 --> 07:08.080
I had to spend my whole time
in boring demigod land!

07:08.280 --> 07:11.840
Now, I’m only here
while he’s a hunk of rock.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.960
So, it’s my turn to be on Earth.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.800
It’s my turn to have fun!

07:18.960 --> 07:22.080
Starting with a game of crush that statue!

07:22.280 --> 07:23.560
-Tara!
-Careful!

07:24.800 --> 07:26.440
Cameron!

07:30.200 --> 07:32.400
Run!

07:34.000 --> 07:36.480
I can’t believe Otto
would do that to her.

07:36.640 --> 07:40.600
Me neither. If I could make her see
that everything might work out.

07:40.800 --> 07:45.000
Take Otto to the Snootcage and hide. Fast.
Leave her to us.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.320
You aren’t getting the door thing.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.600
You have this all wrong, Valentina.
You have Otto wrong.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.600
True love never dies.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.960
Oh, and you two would know, of course.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.520
-Of course.
-Of course.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.120
Then hand over the Snoot.

08:05.320 --> 08:09.920
Or I’ll put my own
special Exclusion Spell on you.

08:10.040 --> 08:13.440
-A spell of solitude.
-What?

08:13.560 --> 08:16.240
It won’t matter if you’re banished or not.

08:16.400 --> 08:21.560
I will make sure you both spend
the rest of your lives unloved and alone.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.600
Hey. I have an idea.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.560
Split up!

08:28.840 --> 08:33.320
Sappy girl, or boy with the Dimples?

08:33.520 --> 08:35.440
I choose Dimples.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.240
(SNOOT BOX RATTLING)
What are you doing?

08:39.400 --> 08:42.000
We’re looking
for somewhere to hide him.

08:42.160 --> 08:45.160
Oh, she’ll never think of looking for
Otto in his house.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.520
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Oh, just keep look out!

08:47.680 --> 08:51.320
All I need to do is open this Snoot box
and we can hide him in there!

08:54.120 --> 08:57.840
-I may have broken the Snoot box.
-Bella!

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
You’re smelling kind of annoyed.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.320
So I’m just gonna tidy up and...

09:03.520 --> 09:06.800
-Look I found these!
-What? No way!

09:06.960 --> 09:09.120
You will not believe what these are.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.000
(SHOE SCREECHING)

09:13.840 --> 09:15.800
(CAMERON GASPS)

09:15.960 --> 09:17.280
Start talking, Dimples.

09:17.440 --> 09:21.600
Okay, if Otto didn’t love you,
why would it be in all the story books?

09:21.760 --> 09:23.640
You’re like Romeo and Juliet here.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.640
Big deal. Who do you think hooked them up?

09:26.800 --> 09:29.120
Now tell me where the Snoot is.

09:29.280 --> 09:33.000
Stop! Just give us one chance.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.600
One chance to prove
that true love never dies.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.720
And if it doesn’t work, fine.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.720
-What’s this?
-Your timeline.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.280
Everyone in Evermoor’s read stories
about you.

09:52.440 --> 09:56.280
Everyone remembers how in love you were.
Everyone except you.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.800
It’s almost sundown.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.280
-If this doesn’t work, you’re banished.
-It’ll work. Has to.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.680
"Otto sang to me from under the balcony.
I totally melted!"

10:10.600 --> 10:15.440
"Otto surprised me with a midnight flight.
Most romantic thing ever!"

10:21.600 --> 10:23.760
"Met a nice Snoot today.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.880
"Led me out of the wild wood
when I got lost.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.520
Think this one could be a keeper."

10:30.680 --> 10:33.080
You remember, don’t you?

10:33.240 --> 10:35.320
How it felt when you were together?

10:35.520 --> 10:38.560
You know what that is? That’s true love.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.840
Of course, you missed a part...

10:47.000 --> 10:51.160
Nine hundred years ago:
Did nothing in demigod realm.

10:51.320 --> 10:56.000
Eight hundred years ago:
Did nothing in demigod realm.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.800
Every year: did nothing!

11:01.800 --> 11:05.240
Now one final time: where is the Snoot?

11:05.400 --> 11:08.560
I won’t tell. It doesn’t matter
if you put a spell on us.

11:08.720 --> 11:13.200
I’m about to be banished anyway.
At least you’ll never find Otto.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.880
Unless my sister walks in with him.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.320
No!

11:23.000 --> 11:25.080
Otto!

11:29.040 --> 11:32.200
Okay, now, I know this looks bad.

11:32.360 --> 11:37.640
-But there is absolutely a way to fix it.
-Look, there better be.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.600
It’s sundown.

11:41.200 --> 11:46.360
"And in conclusion, that is the reason
Evermoor made turnip fnurbling illegal."

11:46.560 --> 11:48.600
This is great.

11:48.760 --> 11:53.000
I hope Aristotle knows I’m really grateful
to have found a buddy like him.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.560
Even if I haven’t said.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.080
He gets that.

11:57.240 --> 12:01.000
And if I do have to leave,
I’ll kind of miss him.

12:01.120 --> 12:05.920
He says we still have a lot of work to do.
There’s no time for sentimental hogwash.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.760
Okay, Ludo, I get it.

12:11.280 --> 12:17.200
Mathematics: "If I have three pieces
of groatcheese and I give you one..."

12:18.720 --> 12:24.320
Sisters, I have gathered you here today
for your safety.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.280
More Everines have gone missing.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.600
Should we chant
to keep our spirits up?

12:32.760 --> 12:36.240
Weave tomorrow today my Sisters

12:36.400 --> 12:41.000
Deeds undone, words unsaid.

12:41.120 --> 12:44.240
Ours the eye that guides the needle

12:44.400 --> 12:49.160
The hand that cuts the thread.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.520
I’ve come for the tapestry thief.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.800
Night is upon us, Tara Crossley!

13:05.960 --> 13:07.920
It is time to leave Evermoor!

13:09.000 --> 13:10.680
What is this?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.520
It can’t be?

13:32.840 --> 13:34.360
Our sister’s in that lantern!

13:34.560 --> 13:39.280
And none of the circle were fated.
Useless Everines.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.960
You made your point, Valentina.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.600
But I got a tapestry to find,
so pucker up.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.520
What are you yapping about?

13:50.680 --> 13:52.000
He’s still got lips.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.360
Even if I did kiss him,
it wouldn’t matter.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.040
I know he doesn’t care.
And I can’t forgive him for what he did.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.320
Yeah? Well, you never read these.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.680
There you are. It’s time to go, Crossleys.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.800
Sorsha! Open up at once!

14:08.960 --> 14:12.080
-What are those?
-Otto’s diaries.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.560
"My father hates that I spend so much time
with Valentina.

14:15.720 --> 14:19.280
"I probably should not have borrowed
his chariot to impress her.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.600
But I didn’t know
he’d put an exclusion spell on us."

14:22.760 --> 14:25.880
What? His dad?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.840
He made it so you
couldn’t be in the same place.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.280
Then he banished Otto here.

14:31.440 --> 14:34.720
None of it was Otto’s fault.

14:37.640 --> 14:41.040
All this time, I thought...

14:41.200 --> 14:42.760
I thought Otto...

14:43.760 --> 14:48.200
You are obliged by the laws of Evermoor
to open up!

14:48.360 --> 14:50.240
You know what you have to do.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.960
If I kiss him, I’ll be gone.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.120
Trapped in the realm again.

14:57.280 --> 15:01.760
But isn’t that proof
that true love exists?

15:08.800 --> 15:11.600
I’d have to care about him more...

15:14.160 --> 15:16.320
More than I do about myself.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.000
Otto!

15:40.120 --> 15:42.120
Valentina...

15:42.280 --> 15:44.160
I never thought I’d see her again.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.200
Open this door before I...

15:47.360 --> 15:52.360
before I shout
open this door even more loudly!

15:52.560 --> 15:55.200
The tapestry.
You said you knew where it was.

15:55.360 --> 15:58.200
The tapestry. Yes, yes, the tapestry...

15:58.360 --> 15:59.720
Where is it?

15:59.880 --> 16:02.080
-Where!?
-It’s on the Beacon.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.920
-The Beacon is empty.
-Trust me. We were tricked.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.560
It’s there!

16:10.080 --> 16:11.640
Otto, wait.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.760
Oh, no.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.000
-The Everines.
-The Founders.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.520
-They were here.
-No time to deal with that now.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.600
You! Where is your sister?

16:35.280 --> 16:39.280
You cannot escape the banishment
by hiding the culprit!

16:39.440 --> 16:43.040
This will change your mind
about the whole thing.

16:43.200 --> 16:49.760
Jake has been working really hard to try
and make up for his previous performance.

16:49.920 --> 16:54.520
He may just be the best student
Evermoor High’s ever had.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.800
This is remarkable. Highly remarkable.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.840
Hey, thanks, pal.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.080
No one’s ever done anything like that
for me before.

17:05.240 --> 17:09.960
Thanks, Jakey-boy, but honestly,
Aristotle did all the work.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.680
Ludo, we both know it was you.

17:12.840 --> 17:16.120
We’re guys.
It’s difficult to express our emotions.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.800
Aristotle just stamped his foot.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.080
We both know he wasn’t saying anything.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.800
Aristotle? What’s that?

17:26.040 --> 17:30.560
You did the work? He’s taking the credit?
He’s cheating to beat the banishment?

17:32.040 --> 17:35.840
If you weren’t banished,
you get extra tuition for the semester!

17:39.360 --> 17:42.920
You know how you were saying
it’s difficult to express my emotions?

17:43.040 --> 17:44.560
You were wrong.

17:44.720 --> 17:48.000
You’re a plongleflook!

17:49.640 --> 17:52.520
I’d be more upset if I knew what that was.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.360
The tapestry!

18:22.960 --> 18:26.880
Look,
someone has sewn an invisibility charm.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.680
-That’s why we couldn’t see.
-So they were here?

18:29.840 --> 18:33.640
That’s it, you’re in the clear!
You can stay!

18:33.800 --> 18:36.000
Probably not time for celebration.

18:36.160 --> 18:41.160
That candle popcorn smell Bella picked up
in here, it meant fear of being found out.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.680
I thought it was me...

18:42.840 --> 18:44.640
You being found out about what?

18:44.800 --> 18:46.120
That’s not important.

18:46.280 --> 18:49.000
The point is, who else was feeling it.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.200
-Who else was hiding in here?
-The Founders.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.720
And they could return.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.640
They’re looking for someone
in a purple robe.

18:59.800 --> 19:03.520
A member of the Circle is the one fated
to release the final Founder.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.520
But there are none left.
We saw what happened to them.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.360
Sorry, I went back to get something
a little warmer.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.560
They really should consider underfloor
heating in here.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.680
Creepy vibe.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.160
-What?
-You kept your cloak.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.080
Yeah! It was kind of toasty.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.680
Oh, Bella.

19:22.840 --> 19:27.320
The girl the Founders are looking for,
it’s you.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.120
Next timeon Evermoor Chronicles.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.640
-Bella Crossley.
-Bella still owns her purple cloak.

19:42.760 --> 19:46.360
Tara? What is with you? Just talk to me!

19:46.560 --> 19:50.800
We can make worry-no-mores!
You whisper worries to the dolls at night.

19:50.960 --> 19:54.240
And in the morning, the dolls are gone
and so are your worries!

19:54.400 --> 19:56.520
-You made sure they were gone?
-Yeah!

19:56.680 --> 19:58.880
Otherwise, they send people crazy.
