WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:09.676
[sighs] Dude, how the hell did we not know
Umberto was illegal?

00:10.885 --> 00:13.263
I mean, in hindsight,
there were some signs.

00:14.097 --> 00:17.725
That time we got that stripper to dress up
like a cop for Berto's birthday,

00:17.809 --> 00:19.436
then he jumped out the window.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.065
It's all my fault.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.194
[sniffles] Come on, man.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.113
-[grunts] No, it ain't.
-No?

00:32.240 --> 00:34.492
Told him not to work this weekend.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.453
I led him to that bar.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.413
Started the fight
that got us all arrested.

00:38.496 --> 00:39.664
Okay, sure.

00:39.747 --> 00:42.041
-Technically, it's all your fault.
-[Rooster sighs]

00:44.127 --> 00:46.838
That guy's been here forever, you know?
His whole life is here.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.966
Yeah. He just bought a house
he can't afford.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.634
What's more American than that?

00:52.927 --> 00:54.304
Damn it.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.139
How did this happen, man?

00:56.764 --> 00:59.392
I'm the fucking Rooster.
My shit's locked down tight.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.729
Now, I got my right-hand man
on his way down to Mexico.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.522
We're stuck here in jail.

01:04.606 --> 01:07.317
Supposed to have all the cows tagged
tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.862
God, I fucked everything up.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.073
Is this what it feels like to be you?

01:16.784 --> 01:18.035
You can't give up.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.997
If I'd have given up,

01:21.081 --> 01:24.376
I'd have never engineered
the greatest comeback in Seahawks history.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.794
You never played for Seattle.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.258
No, the Edmonton Seahawks.
Canadian Football League.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.593
Six minutes on the clock.

01:33.676 --> 01:36.763
We're down by 24
to the Medicine Hat Marauders.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.516
My teammates... they say,

01:40.057 --> 01:41.434
[in Canadian accent]
"Eh, let's take off, eh?

01:41.518 --> 01:43.686
We're not about to beat these hosers."

01:43.770 --> 01:44.771
[chuckles]

01:44.854 --> 01:46.439
[in Canadian accent]
"Let's go drink some Molson, eh?

01:46.523 --> 01:48.108
Let's go drink some syrup, eh?"

01:48.733 --> 01:50.527
[normal] There's three seconds left
on the clock.

01:50.610 --> 01:54.822
We're down by four, right?
So I heave up a prayer.

01:54.906 --> 01:58.368
My tight end, Steve Koslowaski,
goes up over four defenders,

01:58.451 --> 02:01.913
catches the ball, end zone, one hand.
Touchdown.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.373
Place goes nuts, right?

02:03.456 --> 02:06.709
Unfortunately, Steve comes down
on the ball, ruptured his spleen.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.835
He died.

02:09.171 --> 02:12.549
But the important part is we never quit.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.513
[sighs] Look, Colt, appreciate what
you're trying to do, but...

02:18.596 --> 02:20.682
I mean,
I think even if I had Berto here...

02:22.058 --> 02:25.061
Not enough time for me
to get everything done. [sighs]

02:25.687 --> 02:27.480
-What if I help?
-[sighs]

02:28.981 --> 02:31.818
I mean, even if we got
all the cows tagged, like...

02:31.901 --> 02:34.696
I got a ton of paperwork
and computer shit to do.

02:34.779 --> 02:35.947
I am not good at that.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.699
Dude, up until last week,

02:37.782 --> 02:40.952
I thought PDF stood for
"public display of fucking."

02:43.455 --> 02:46.291
Get Abby to do it.
Paperwork, that's like her Madden.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.420
[sighs] I don't know.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.715
Come on, man.
Do it for Berto!

02:53.798 --> 02:56.384
Hell, do it for Steve Koslowaski!

02:56.468 --> 02:59.929
Do it for the guy in Thunder Bay, Ontario,
that got Steve's heart!

03:02.390 --> 03:03.475
All right.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.143
-All right. Shit, yeah...
-Yeah!

03:06.228 --> 03:07.645
-We can do this, right?
-Fuck yeah!

03:07.729 --> 03:08.813
Yeah.

03:08.896 --> 03:10.565
Shit, we're still in jail.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.528
[theme song playing]

04:20.885 --> 04:22.470
What's taking them so long?

04:22.554 --> 04:25.557
They have all their information
from their last arrest.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.436
When was that?

04:29.519 --> 04:33.648
Was it the drunken NASCAR race
with the handicap scooters through Kmart?

04:36.318 --> 04:39.904
No, it was the time they went streaking
through Arby's, yelling,

04:39.988 --> 04:42.824
-"We have the meats."
-Oh, yeah.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.161
-Jesus.
-That's right.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.748
Are we bad parents?

04:50.832 --> 04:54.251
If we were bad parents,
we wouldn't be here bailing 'em out.

04:56.003 --> 04:58.798
Oh, uh, Jerry sent me an e-mail.
He wants to meet later.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.800
Apparently, I have an offer on the bar.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.844
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.596
Well, good for you.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.973
Wish someone would make an offer
on the boys.

05:09.141 --> 05:11.143
-Hey. Mary.
-Oh, hey, Beau. Maggie.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.104
-Hey, Phyllis. What's up?
-Hi, Mary.

05:13.187 --> 05:17.233
Frank, don't freak out.
Just visiting. [chuckling]

05:17.317 --> 05:19.402
I may have been here a few times before.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.114
You didn't have to come out.
We would've picked 'em both up.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.157
Oh, yeah, Rooster wasn't sure
y'all were coming.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.160
Oh, plus, Cindy in fingerprinting wanted
to show me pictures of her new baby.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.496
They did a little mug shot.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.790
Booked the kid for excessive cuteness
and carrying a loaded diaper.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.417
[Mary and Beau chuckle]

05:37.379 --> 05:38.671
So, how's Heather doing?

05:38.755 --> 05:41.424
Oh, you know,
she has her good days and her bad days.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.802
Baby daddy's in jail,
so that's about right for the Roth girls.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.181
I just wish this whole situation
wasn't so hard on her.

05:49.807 --> 05:52.059
I'm sorry she's having such a tough time.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.355
-She's a fine young woman.
-Aw, thank you.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.191
[chuckles] I'd ask you
how Colt and Rooster are doing, but...

05:59.275 --> 06:00.276
I think we know.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.114
-But we still love 'em.
-[Mary chuckles]

06:05.198 --> 06:06.199
Right?

06:09.326 --> 06:11.413
Hey, Ma, thanks for coming.

06:13.164 --> 06:16.250
Oh. Thanks for bringing Dad.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.087
Whoa! What the hell?
There was money in here.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.174
Hey. Someone owes me three bucks.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.719
That's my man.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.432
-Hey, who wants to go to Arby's?
-[Rooster] Oh.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.690
-What's up, Abby?
-How's the tagging going?

06:38.773 --> 06:39.774
It's going.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.193
We got a lot of work to do
and not a lot of time to do it in.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.153
Plus, Colt just wasted, like, 15 minutes

06:44.236 --> 06:46.698
trying to decide what cow
was gonna be number 69.

06:48.658 --> 06:52.369
-You heard from Berto?
-I did, yeah. He's doing all right.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.206
He's not back home yet,
but he's excited to see his family.

06:55.289 --> 06:58.042
[chuckles] He's told them so many stories
about us,

06:58.125 --> 07:01.629
they got a rooster named Rooster
and a jackass named Colt. [chuckles]

07:03.715 --> 07:06.300
You'll never guess who stopped by
the ice hut last night

07:06.383 --> 07:08.595
while you idiots
were getting yourselves arrested.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.305
-Who?
-Weather girl extraordinaire...

07:11.388 --> 07:14.141
-Tanya Showers.
-Fuck you, no way!

07:15.226 --> 07:16.436
What'd you guys talk about?

07:17.019 --> 07:18.104
Did you hook up?

07:18.187 --> 07:20.231
-Did we hook up?
-Well, that's not a no.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.569
I wasn't gonna say anything...

07:24.652 --> 07:27.739
but it was cold,
so I made her an Irish coffee.

07:27.822 --> 07:31.493
We started talking for a while and then...
you know.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.703
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.412
You don't get
to the good part of the story

07:35.497 --> 07:36.998
and just end it with "you know."

07:37.081 --> 07:38.833
-I thought you had work to do.
-Fuck work!

07:40.042 --> 07:41.168
Well, it was cold,

07:41.252 --> 07:43.004
-and we only had one blanket.
-Yeah.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.965
So we both climbed under
and then Tanya's hand--

07:46.048 --> 07:47.509
-Rooster, we got a problem.
-Shut up, Colt.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.722
Found a dead heifer down by the pond.
Looked like a mountain lion.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.892
-You kidding me? How old's the carcass?
-A day.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.478
Damn. Well, it's coming back tonight.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.355
I can't lose another cow.
Maybe we get a shot at him.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.358
Yeah. I guess we'll finish
tagging up them cows

08:04.441 --> 08:08.070
and then... stay out all night,
get drunk and shoot something.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.698
-[both chuckle]
-Just like high school all over again.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.702
Hopefully this time
you don't shoot the Grand Junction mascot.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.996
Oh, come on, he was fine.
You drink a 12-pack

08:17.079 --> 08:19.624
and tell me that don't look
like a real griffin coming at you.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.709
[laughing]

08:31.468 --> 08:33.137
-Oh! Hey, Beau.
-Hey, Mary.

08:33.220 --> 08:35.515
I got a little gift for Heather.
Is she around?

08:36.182 --> 08:38.851
Of course. Much like your kids,
my kids never move out.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.604
Even worse, my kids make more kids.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.648
-[Beau chuckles] Yeah.
-[Mary chuckles] Come on in.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.818
Hey, Heather, you've got company!

08:48.778 --> 08:50.988
Whoa! Something smells good.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.782
Yeah, we're making apple pie.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.409
It'll be ready in about an hour
if you wanna sit and chat.

08:55.492 --> 08:56.619
Chat for an hour?

08:56.703 --> 08:59.288
I like apple pie, but not that much.

08:59.371 --> 09:00.832
[Mary chuckles]

09:00.915 --> 09:03.751
Mr. Bennett. Good to see you.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.212
Hi, Heather.
How you doing?

09:06.963 --> 09:10.132
Doing all right.
Hormones are a bit of a roller coaster.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.135
For some reason,
Geico commercials make me cry.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.514
I guess it's just 'cause
that lizard's so small and...

09:17.599 --> 09:18.891
[voice breaking] the world's so big.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.393
Yeah.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.437
This is that chatting I was worried about.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.649
Brought you a little present.

09:27.524 --> 09:28.693
Really?

09:32.739 --> 09:36.993
Oh, my God. [sniffles]
That is so cute.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.870
What's his name?

09:38.953 --> 09:40.663
I don't know. Horse?

09:41.413 --> 09:42.414
[Mary chuckles]

09:43.040 --> 09:46.293
Aw, that is so sweet.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.922
-Beau, did you make this?
-Yeah, my father made it for me.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.799
I gave it to Rooster and Colt.

09:52.424 --> 09:54.594
Colt tried to run away from home
with it one day.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.680
He sat in the driveway and rocked
and rocked for about three hours.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.890
[Mary and Heather chuckling]

09:58.973 --> 10:00.600
At least he's always been good-looking.

10:00.683 --> 10:01.684
[Mary chuckles]

10:03.227 --> 10:04.937
Thank you so much, Mr. Bennett.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.982
I know this isn't easy for you.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.568
But you're gonna be
the mother of my grandchild

10:11.653 --> 10:13.404
and that makes you a Bennett, too.

10:14.571 --> 10:17.617
There's ever anything you need,
you just let me know.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.870
You'll always have a seat at our table.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.457
Oh, my God, this is like Geico times ten.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.961
-[sobbing] Thank you.
-All right. Okay. That's...

10:34.008 --> 10:37.053
Hank, there's something I wanna tell you.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.849
I'm selling the bar.
Jerry's on his way over with the offer.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.100
Wow.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.980
You always hear about these things
happening to other people...

10:52.068 --> 10:54.987
but you never think it'll happen to you.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.326
-Hey, Maggie.
-Hey, Jerry.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.829
Um, we should probably talk privately.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.040
Anything you have to say to Maggie,
you can say in front of me.

11:07.875 --> 11:11.671
Hank, I think it's better if you stay put.
You're too emotionally involved.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.758
How you doing, Jerry?
How were your holidays?

11:15.842 --> 11:19.971
Great. I made a New Year's resolution
to lose five pounds.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.850
And I got food poisoning
and hit my goal. [chuckles]

11:27.019 --> 11:28.020
Here you are.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.480
-Ooh, is that the offer?
-Yes.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.943
Now, I'm sure
you were hoping for something better,

11:34.026 --> 11:35.945
but try to keep an open mind.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.281
It's funny, that's the first time
I've ever said that

11:39.365 --> 11:41.617
with my clothes on. [laughs]

11:51.418 --> 11:53.587
-I mean, are you kidding me?
-No.

11:53.670 --> 11:54.671
Is this it?

11:54.756 --> 11:56.841
[stammering] But look, it is all cash.

11:56.924 --> 11:59.676
How am I supposed to get excited
about an offer

11:59.761 --> 12:02.221
that ends with "and 75 cents"?

12:04.598 --> 12:07.935
[sighs] This bar is worth
so much more than this.

12:08.019 --> 12:11.355
I have loyal customers.
Hank alone covers the utilities.

12:11.438 --> 12:14.358
[chuckling] Yeah, well...

12:14.441 --> 12:17.653
they don't care about the business.
They just want the land.

12:17.736 --> 12:22.699
They're gonna build a charging station for
electric cars on their way to Telluride.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.869
[sighs] Environmentalists.

12:24.952 --> 12:28.705
Great. Now I'm getting fucked
by people I actually admire.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.082
[Jerry chuckles]

12:31.793 --> 12:34.128
I don't know.
Can we wait for another offer?

12:34.211 --> 12:37.464
Well, it's your call, but I'm not sure
you're gonna get a better offer.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.801
Small towns are dying, Maggie.

12:39.884 --> 12:43.470
[scoffs] Trust me, I drive by
boarded-up stores every day.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.472
The only places left around here

12:45.556 --> 12:48.475
are this place, the liquor store
and the Yarn Barn.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.685
[Jerry chuckles]

12:50.477 --> 12:52.729
What is it with this town and yarn?

12:54.899 --> 12:56.525
By the way, thank you for the pot holders.

12:56.608 --> 12:57.609
[Jerry] Mmm-hmm.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.448
I'm sorry, you know,
about the only way you're gonna make more

13:02.531 --> 13:04.992
is if you burn the place down
for the insurance money.

13:06.493 --> 13:08.537
But that's not legal advice.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.667
[stammering] And it certainly
has nothing to do with...

13:13.750 --> 13:16.670
you know,
my completely accidental boat fire.

13:25.596 --> 13:26.722
[knocking at door]

13:34.355 --> 13:35.356
Hey, Heather.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.025
Hey, Mr. Bennett.
I brought you a little gift.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.443
-Oh!
-[Heather chuckles]

13:39.526 --> 13:42.654
I've been thinking about apple pie
since this morning.

13:42.738 --> 13:46.783
Almost built you a crib
so I could have an excuse to go back.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.494
[chuckles]

13:49.620 --> 13:50.788
I can get us some plates.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.040
I didn't say I was gonna share.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.750
[Heather chuckles]

13:56.418 --> 14:00.672
So, actually,
I didn't come by just to bring you a pie.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.843
You said if there was ever
anything that I needed...

14:04.927 --> 14:06.845
Heather, whatever it is, you got it.

14:07.846 --> 14:11.267
When the boys need something,
it's usually money...

14:12.809 --> 14:13.936
or beer.

14:15.812 --> 14:17.564
-Or money for beer.
-[chuckles]

14:18.482 --> 14:19.901
I don't need any money.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.153
But just out of curiosity,
how much could I have gotten?

14:23.779 --> 14:25.948
-A lot more than either of them.
-[chuckles]

14:28.284 --> 14:29.326
The thing is...

14:30.202 --> 14:34.248
I don't have a lot of positive
male role models in my life, and...

14:34.331 --> 14:35.749
you don't have to say yes...

14:37.418 --> 14:40.212
but I was wondering
if you'd be the baby's godfather.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.965
I'm flattered.

14:44.508 --> 14:48.345
But don't you think I'm a little... old?

14:49.846 --> 14:51.682
You're only as old as you feel.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.143
Well, I feel older than I am.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.818
Mr. Bennett,
if my child ever had a problem...

15:03.610 --> 15:07.156
I can't imagine anyone I'd want them
coming to more than you.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.409
All right. I'm honored.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.661
Thank you.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.374
-Abby?
-Hey.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.460
Hey.

15:19.543 --> 15:20.627
Hey!

15:25.799 --> 15:29.303
Uh, sorry to interrupt.
I was just meeting Colt here later.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.888
It's okay. I was just leaving.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.224
Heather, wait.

15:34.141 --> 15:37.436
I should probably apologize for what
I said to you at the bar the other night.

15:38.645 --> 15:39.813
Okay.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.943
Just so you know, that's not an apology.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.363
I know. You're right. [groans]

15:48.155 --> 15:49.698
I was drunk, really drunk,

15:49.781 --> 15:52.034
and I said some things that I didn't mean
and I'm sorry.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.036
It's fine.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.372
But honestly...

15:56.455 --> 15:58.415
I kinda feel like you said some things
you did mean.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.877
All right, who wants pie?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.716
[stammers] I wasn't myself that night.

16:07.799 --> 16:11.512
Just admit it. You don't like me.
You've never liked me.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.472
I'm just some dumb student
that you taught in high school,

16:13.555 --> 16:15.599
and if Colt didn't exist,
you would've already forgot about me.

16:15.682 --> 16:17.809
Okay, Heather, I like you, okay?

16:17.893 --> 16:20.646
And the word's "forgotten," not "forgot,"
but I correct everyone.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.192
-Point is, I like you.
-[Beau] All right...

16:25.276 --> 16:30.156
She likes you, you like her.
I like you both, and we all like pie.

16:33.450 --> 16:34.910
But really?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.745
'Cause ever since Colt and I hooked up,

16:36.828 --> 16:40.499
all you've ever done is make bitchy little
comments about my age or my intelligence.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.751
Maybe you're right. Maybe I didn't think
you should be together.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.336
But I didn't ask for this.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.256
I didn't expect you to be pregnant
with Colt's baby.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.175
Yeah, well, neither did I.
It's an accident.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.177
-Was it?
-What's that supposed to mean?

16:51.260 --> 16:52.969
It means the second
Colt and I get into an argument,

16:53.054 --> 16:55.431
you're sleeping with him
without any protection.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.765
What, you think I wanted this?

16:56.848 --> 16:59.310
Well, if the condom doesn't fit,
don't wear it.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.270
You know what, Abby?

17:01.353 --> 17:03.605
You think you're better
and smarter than everyone.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.232
But you're not.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.402
You're a fucking high school teacher
in Garrison.

17:08.485 --> 17:09.486
Get over yourself.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.908
[microwave beeping]

17:15.742 --> 17:17.036
Pie's ready.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.388
Oh, my God, that's good. [chuckles]

17:38.099 --> 17:39.266
Don't eat that.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.934
What? Why?

17:41.643 --> 17:43.645
Is it a prank?
Did Rooster pee in it?

17:47.649 --> 17:51.320
-No, Heather made it for your dad.
-Oh.

17:52.779 --> 17:54.198
It's really good.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.450
Heather stop by?

17:57.159 --> 18:00.329
Yeah, and I tried to apologize
for what I said when I was drunk

18:00.412 --> 18:01.497
and she didn't accept it.

18:02.498 --> 18:06.127
And it got personal, ugly,
and your dad was there.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.962
Don't worry.
My dad's seen a lot of girl fights.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.133
He raised Rooster. [chuckling]

18:15.010 --> 18:17.388
Remind me to tell that to Rooster later.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.891
Colt, it's not funny, okay?

18:20.974 --> 18:23.560
She told me I was stuck up
and that I need to get over myself.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.980
Look, Heather's going through
a tough time.

18:27.063 --> 18:28.232
You've gotta give her a break.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.195
Are you taking her side?

18:38.659 --> 18:42.371
No. No, I...
I'm not taking anyone's side.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.457
Really? 'Cause I just told you
that she insulted me

18:45.541 --> 18:47.793
and you seem to care
more about how she's doing.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.295
I don't have time for this right now.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.962
-Seriously?
-Yeah!

18:51.046 --> 18:53.048
I haven't slept in two days.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.592
I got arrested.
[stutters] My best friend got deported.

18:55.676 --> 18:59.555
Now I gotta spend the whole night helping
Rooster hunt down some mountain lion.

19:00.389 --> 19:03.434
Cool. Thanks for the support.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.728
[sighs] I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.772
It just came out kind of aggressive.

19:08.855 --> 19:10.649
Probably because I'm holding a gun.

19:12.984 --> 19:15.362
Can't you just figure this out?

19:17.573 --> 19:18.574
Sure.

19:19.866 --> 19:21.243
I'll figure it out.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.081
Great.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.171
Give me that!

19:35.716 --> 19:37.343
Fuck, this is delicious!

19:42.013 --> 19:44.225
Look... [sighs and sniffles]

19:45.726 --> 19:48.354
Just wanna say,
you were right about this... this job.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.565
A lot of people'd kill for it.
I nearly pissed it away.

19:53.525 --> 19:57.028
[sighs] Without you and Abby
and all your help, you know...

19:57.821 --> 20:00.782
tagging the cows
and helping me turn this around...

20:03.118 --> 20:06.622
never would have happened.
So... thank you. You're a good brother.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.334
All right, enough with the sappy shit.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.218
What if this carcass is just a trap?

20:20.511 --> 20:23.597
What if this mountain lion
is just luring us out here to eat us?

20:24.598 --> 20:25.932
What?

20:27.393 --> 20:28.894
Why would you put that in my head?

20:29.728 --> 20:32.606
I'm just saying, man,
you gotta be ready for anything.

20:32.689 --> 20:35.484
For example, this thing goes sideways,
I'm shooting you in the leg,

20:35.567 --> 20:37.986
sacrificing you to the cat
and I'm home free.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.325
I'm not even mad.
That's just a good plan.

20:45.952 --> 20:48.330
Abby and Heather
got in a huge fight today.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.123
Really?

20:52.668 --> 20:54.753
I don't know who I'd take in that fight.

20:55.754 --> 20:59.383
Heather's got the reach, but...
Abby's got that crazy, you know?

21:00.467 --> 21:02.428
Like, if she were in prison,
she'd have a bitch.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.725
Can't be the way it's gonna be
for the rest of my life.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.145
You know, I didn't even get
to watch  SportsCenter  today?

21:12.228 --> 21:14.773
I got no idea
what's going on in the world.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.861
-You want my advice?
-No.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.781
Gotta get 'em together.
Get 'em talking.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.075
Girls love talking.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.285
[shushing]

21:32.791 --> 21:34.585
Here, kitty, kitty.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.045
[Colt] On three.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.008
One, two--

21:42.843 --> 21:45.304
Whoo-hoo-hoo! I got him.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.930
Dude, what the fuck? I said three!

21:47.013 --> 21:48.849
[chuckling] Yeah, I know, dipshit.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.020
Hell, Maggie,
you'd get more for this place

21:54.104 --> 21:56.690
if you burned it to the ground
and collected the insurance.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.318
[chuckles] Jerry said the same thing.

22:00.151 --> 22:02.946
I guess I just have to decide
if I wanna be inside or outside

22:03.029 --> 22:04.948
when I light the match.

22:05.031 --> 22:06.074
I'm sorry.

22:06.742 --> 22:07.784
Oh...

22:08.410 --> 22:12.122
it's just that this place was supposed
to be my retirement, you know?

22:12.205 --> 22:14.290
My ticket to the rest of the world.

22:14.375 --> 22:17.043
You don't wanna see the rest of the world.

22:17.127 --> 22:20.506
If Walmart's full of assholes,
what do you think France is like?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.761
Oh, the worst part is they wanna level it

22:25.844 --> 22:28.389
and turn it into a charging station
for electric cars.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.558
Yeah, I mean,
they can't be from around here.

22:31.642 --> 22:35.103
Everybody I know would rather stop driving
than drinking.

22:36.271 --> 22:38.314
A charging station?

22:38.399 --> 22:41.317
Forget burning the place down.
Now I wanna blow it up.

22:41.402 --> 22:44.488
They can drive their little toy cars
right into the crater.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.784
[sighing] I don't know.

22:49.660 --> 22:53.121
I guess I always thought
I was building something here.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.873
You have.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.292
You took a rundown honky-tonk

22:57.375 --> 22:59.586
and turned it into the best bar
in Garrison.

23:00.295 --> 23:02.464
It's the only bar in Garrison.

23:02.548 --> 23:06.051
Unless you count the heavy communion pours
by Father McGinty.

23:07.218 --> 23:08.261
I don't know.

23:08.344 --> 23:12.223
Thought I'd be remembered for something,
even if it was just this bar.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.392
Your legacy isn't this building.

23:15.226 --> 23:17.896
Your legacy is in the memories
this place created.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.441
People lived their lives here.

23:21.066 --> 23:25.446
You know, they've had...
had their first dates, they've proposed.

23:26.154 --> 23:28.532
There was even a baby born
in the ladies' room.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.784
Yeah, and a guy died in the kitchen.

23:32.661 --> 23:35.205
See? It's not a bar.

23:35.288 --> 23:38.208
-It's the circle of fucking life.
-[chuckles]

23:39.543 --> 23:40.586
Thanks, Beau.

23:41.252 --> 23:43.880
So... what are you gonna do?

23:44.465 --> 23:47.509
I don't know. Jerry says we probably
won't get another offer.

23:49.135 --> 23:53.223
I've always trusted my gut.
What's yours telling you?

23:54.057 --> 23:55.684
Screw it.

23:55.767 --> 23:59.395
I just better make sure
my fire insurance is up to date.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.356
Good for you, Maggie.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.441
Yeah, I'd rather not sell

24:03.525 --> 24:07.028
than turn it into a fancy rest stop
for guys with man buns.

24:08.530 --> 24:09.740
Man buns?

24:10.491 --> 24:13.702
I don't know what that is.
And please don't tell me.

24:19.207 --> 24:21.251
-[Abby sighs]
-[Colt] Hey, morning.

24:22.252 --> 24:25.296
Just cooking a little breakfast
for my favorite girl.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.509
You don't cook.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.595
[chuckles] These hotcakes
and sausages beg to differ.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.265
[Abby] Oh.

24:35.348 --> 24:37.726
Are you doing that thing
where you run to McDonald's

24:37.809 --> 24:39.477
and then pretend to cook for me?

24:44.024 --> 24:45.025
No.

24:47.611 --> 24:48.737
What if I check the garbage?

24:48.820 --> 24:50.531
No, please don't do that.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.659
Did you at least get me a McGriddle?

24:57.328 --> 24:59.455
-[mouthing] Yes.
-Here you go.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.583
-[Abby chuckles]
-Uh-uh.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.341
I'm really sorry about last night.

25:12.343 --> 25:13.386
[knocking at door]

25:15.346 --> 25:16.514
-Is that Heather?
-Um...

25:16.598 --> 25:18.934
[clears throat] Also really sorry
about this morning.

25:23.229 --> 25:25.607
You didn't tell me she was gonna be here.

25:25.691 --> 25:26.775
[Abby] Wait.

25:28.735 --> 25:31.404
-You invited her here?
-All right. We all need to talk.

25:31.487 --> 25:32.739
-Forget it.
-No, I'm outta here.

25:32.823 --> 25:33.907
[stammering] Wait.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.703
Well, I just had
the worst weekend of my life.

25:38.328 --> 25:39.955
And I can't have y'all fighting.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.207
So you gotta get along.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.836
You can't force us to be friends, Colt.

25:47.462 --> 25:51.299
Okay.
[stammering] So, what do I do?

25:51.382 --> 25:54.886
You tell me what I need to do
to make this better.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.097
'Cause I'm freaking out.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.557
[stammering] I need your help.

26:00.141 --> 26:04.688
Uh, we're having a baby.
That's right, you, me, us, like, together.

26:05.438 --> 26:07.273
So, if y'all don't get along...

26:09.400 --> 26:10.611
what are we gonna do?

26:11.361 --> 26:12.362
I don't know.

26:13.488 --> 26:14.948
I don't know, either.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.285
Listen...

26:21.579 --> 26:25.375
I knew you were pregnant...
when I took Colt back.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.878
I knew what I was getting into,
and he's right.

26:28.670 --> 26:29.755
There's a baby coming.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.091
Yeah, no kidding.

26:34.134 --> 26:37.095
And right now,
that baby wants that McGriddle.

26:53.403 --> 26:56.031
[chuckling] Holy shit!
I ain't never seen that before.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.702
I normally get extra cheese.
It's better that way.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.245
Colt fucked up. [scoffs]

27:04.164 --> 27:05.540
It's still pretty good.

27:08.334 --> 27:09.670
I'm sorry.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.631
Truth is...

27:15.383 --> 27:17.803
[sighs] I'm jealous.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.933
You know, I... thought I'd be the one
starting a family with Colt.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.104
I'm sorry.

27:30.273 --> 27:33.526
-I didn't mean to take that from you.
-I know.

27:34.235 --> 27:37.655
This, though, I...
I don't regret. [chuckles]

27:41.576 --> 27:45.080
Just so you know...
I'm jealous of you, too.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.539
[scoffs]

27:46.622 --> 27:50.043
You went to college, you got a great job,

27:50.126 --> 27:53.213
you don't live at home with your mom,
your sister and her kids.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.800
Could be doing a little better
on the boyfriend front, though. [chuckles]

27:58.593 --> 28:01.471
-Okay, I don't think that's necessary--
-Colt, don't interrupt her.

28:05.892 --> 28:08.436
Listen, it's not always gonna be easy,
but...

28:08.519 --> 28:10.731
I wanna do whatever I can
to be there for you and the baby.

28:13.691 --> 28:14.692
Thank you.

28:18.696 --> 28:22.158
So... you guys are all good?

28:23.618 --> 28:25.161
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.830
SportsCenter.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.670
[chuckles] Yeah, no,
it's a company phone, Mary.

28:34.755 --> 28:37.007
Just send me a picture.
I'll delete it. [chuckles]

28:37.966 --> 28:40.260
[stammers] Oh, that's a fair price
for our cattle.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.678
Yeah. I'm sure
we could make a business deal.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.933
[whispering] Send the pic.
I'll call you later.

28:49.352 --> 28:51.604
Well, hey. What's up, Rich?

28:52.480 --> 28:54.816
So you got the whole tracking system
up and going?

28:54.900 --> 28:56.234
I did.

28:56.317 --> 28:58.862
-We gotta talk.
-Killed a mountain lion, too.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.030
Look, Rooster...

29:00.113 --> 29:01.865
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
but you're fired.

29:01.948 --> 29:02.991
[scoffs]

29:04.284 --> 29:05.118
What?

29:05.201 --> 29:06.912
Did you get in a bar fight on Friday?

29:07.703 --> 29:09.831
No, I won a bar fight on Friday.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.795
Did Umberto get deported
as a result of that bar fight?

29:17.964 --> 29:19.674
Well, shit. [sighs]

29:20.675 --> 29:21.717
I see where this is headed.

29:21.802 --> 29:24.179
I already told you where it's headed.
You're fired.

29:26.139 --> 29:29.392
Rich, I did every single thing
you told me to.

29:29.475 --> 29:30.852
You did.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.728
You also went fishing
when you were supposed to be working.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.941
You also drove the company truck
after you'd been drinking,

29:36.024 --> 29:37.984
to a bar, where you got arrested.

29:39.152 --> 29:42.697
You also replied to my corporate e-mails
with the word "unsubscribe."

29:44.074 --> 29:47.828
You are a good rancher, Rooster,
but you are a terrible employee.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.998
You have no idea what you're doing.

29:52.082 --> 29:53.333
You still think it's me.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.293
I work for people.
You work for people.

29:55.376 --> 29:57.587
If you understood that,
you would still have a job.

29:58.754 --> 29:59.755
[Rich sighs]

30:00.548 --> 30:03.134
I'm gonna need any keys
you have to the ranch and to your truck.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.219
[cell phone chimes]

30:04.302 --> 30:05.636
I'm gonna need that phone, too.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.390
Well, I can't give you that right now.

30:12.060 --> 30:15.271
All right, well,
clear out any personal items.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.899
Leave anything company-related
on the desk.

30:23.113 --> 30:24.865
Sorry it didn't work out.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.260
[melancholy music playing]
