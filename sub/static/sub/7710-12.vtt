00:00.968 --> 00:02.170
Lords of the Ring trilogy,

00:02.203 --> 00:05.106
if you see it back to back,
it's really long, but it's good.

00:05.139 --> 00:05.839
Dunder Mifflin,
this is Pam.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.141
Pam! It's Michael.
Help me.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.442
I need help right now.

00:08.476 --> 00:09.610
Michael, what's wrong?

00:09.643 --> 00:11.679
I'm hurt.
I have hurt myself!

00:11.712 --> 00:13.381
Ohh, my God!
Okay, wait, wait, wait!

00:13.414 --> 00:15.083
Oh, this is not
looking good, Pam!

00:15.116 --> 00:17.051
Michael, do you need me
to call an ambulance?!

00:17.085 --> 00:18.552
No, I want you
to pick me up.

00:18.586 --> 00:19.620
Ohh!
Okay.
What's going on?

00:19.653 --> 00:21.822
Wait a sec, I thought
you said that you were hurt.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.091
I am hurt.
I hurt my foot.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.092
Pam, what's going on?

00:24.125 --> 00:25.393
I want to come to work,

00:25.426 --> 00:26.760
but I need you to
come and pick me up.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.762
Ohh, God!

00:28.796 --> 00:30.198
Hey, whoa!
Michael!

00:30.231 --> 00:31.199
Oh, God!

00:31.232 --> 00:32.766
It's okay.
It's Jim.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.369
Just say again,
really loudly, what happened.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.538
Okay. Buhh!
I burned my foot!

00:37.571 --> 00:40.108
Very badly,
on my Foreman Grill,

00:40.141 --> 00:43.311
and I now need someone
to come and bring me into work.

00:43.344 --> 00:46.780
You burned your foot
on a Foreman Grill?

00:46.814 --> 00:48.349
I enjoy
having breakfast in bed.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.184
I like waking up
to the smell of bacon.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.252
Sue me.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.720
And since I don't
have a butler,

00:52.753 --> 00:54.122
I have to do it myself.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.690
So most nights
before I go to bed,

00:56.724 --> 01:00.594
I will lay six strips of bacon
out on my George Foreman Grill.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.795
Then I go to sleep.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.698
When I wake up,
I plug in the grill.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.334
I go back to sleep again.

01:06.367 --> 01:10.338
Then I wake up to the smell
of crackling bacon.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.706
It is delicious.
It's good for me.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.742
It's a perfect way
to start the day.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.878
Today I got up,
I stepped onto the grill,

01:17.911 --> 01:19.747
and it clamped down
on my foot, that's it.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.716
I don't see what's
so hard to believe about that.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.751
Pam, could you
come get me?

01:23.784 --> 01:26.887
Uh, I have to stay here
and answer the phone.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.722
Okay, could someone come
and get me, please

01:28.756 --> 01:30.858
Michael, you should
stay home and rest.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.893
There's no toilet paper here.
Could Ryan...

01:32.926 --> 01:34.695
Tell Ryan
to bring toilet paper!

01:34.728 --> 01:36.197
Could you tell him that?

01:36.230 --> 01:37.265
Can you hop?

01:37.298 --> 01:38.699
I tried hopping, Kevin,

01:38.732 --> 01:41.235
and I bumped my elbow
against the wall,

01:41.269 --> 01:44.738
and now my elbow
has a "protruberence."

01:46.474 --> 01:48.409
No one wants
to pick me up?!

01:49.877 --> 01:51.212
What is going on?

01:52.380 --> 01:53.547
What is going on?

01:53.581 --> 01:55.483
Michael is, um, sick,

01:55.516 --> 01:56.684
and he wants one of us
to rescue him.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.186
I'm not sick, I'm--
I'm coming, Michael!

01:58.219 --> 01:59.753
I'm gonna save you!

01:59.787 --> 02:01.822
Don't! Is that Dwight?
I do not want Dwight.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.924
Hold on, Michael,
I am coming!

02:03.957 --> 02:05.226
Wait there!
I do not want Dwight!

02:06.594 --> 02:08.262
Michael, why don't you
call your girlfriend?

02:08.296 --> 02:09.563
I don't have
a girlfriend.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.898
But you said you went out
with her this weekend.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.734
It was all made up.
Just

02:13.767 --> 02:14.902
Anyone.
Anyone but Dwight.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.807
What was that?
What was that?

02:21.442 --> 02:23.244
Ohh.
Ohh!

02:23.277 --> 02:25.713
He hit the pole.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.781
It's broken, right?
He can't--

02:27.815 --> 02:31.552
Oh, Dwight. Dwight.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.720
Ohh!

02:32.753 --> 02:35.589
Oh, my God.
Oh, my gosh.
Is he okay?

02:36.790 --> 02:37.958
He's still driving.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.294
Dwight...

02:40.328 --> 02:42.496
You forgot your bumper!

02:42.530 --> 02:43.664
Hello?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.499
Please don't send Dwight.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.538
Morning, everyone.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.873
Don't freak out.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.776
I forbid anybody
to freak out.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.478
Clearly I have had
a very serious accident.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.845
But I will recover.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.514
God willing.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.383
I just wanna be
treated normally today.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.984
Normal would
actually be good.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.519
Considering the trauma
that I've been through.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.787
You missed two big
conference calls today.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.888
One with corporate.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.991
Oh, did you
explain...why?

03:44.024 --> 03:46.827
No, I didn't mention
that you cooked your foot.

03:46.860 --> 03:47.895
Burned my foot, Pam.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.533
Please stop
popping my cast.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.734
Thank you.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.737
So where are you
shipping your foot?

03:56.770 --> 03:59.607
Ha ha ha.
So where are you shipping...

04:01.309 --> 04:03.577
Your foot.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.580
Thank you.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.582
Pam, messages, please.

04:08.616 --> 04:09.817
You didn't have any.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.784
Really?

04:10.818 --> 04:14.888
Well, seemed very important
to you earlier

04:14.922 --> 04:16.757
that you needed
to stay and...

04:16.790 --> 04:18.692
Do my job?
No.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.295
Your job is being
my friend, Pam...and--

04:21.329 --> 04:22.730
Ow!
God!

04:22.763 --> 04:23.897
It slipped.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.899
What did--
Sorry.

04:25.933 --> 04:26.767
It's just that before,
you said

04:26.800 --> 04:27.668
you didn't want
any special treatment.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.404
I don't want
any special treatment, Pam.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.939
I just want you to treat me

04:31.972 --> 04:34.007
like you would
a family member

04:34.041 --> 04:37.445
who's undergone some sort
of serious physical trauma.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.480
I don't think that's
too much to ask.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.048
Do you want some aspirin?
Because you seem a little fussy.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.517
No, I don't want some aspirin.
Yeah, I am fussy.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.885
Aspirin's not gonna
do a damn thing.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.788
I'm sitting here with
a bloody stump of a foot.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.324
Pam, I am
Assistant Regional Manager.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.759
And I can
take care of him.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.595
Part of my duties are to...

04:59.467 --> 05:02.102
What?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.937
Part of your duties
are to what?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.573
What?

05:05.606 --> 05:07.741
You just said that part of
your duties are to something.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.076
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.378
What is wrong with you?

05:10.411 --> 05:12.480
What is wrong with you?

05:25.926 --> 05:27.528
Where is my cornbread?

05:27.561 --> 05:28.829
Here you go.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.864
Thank you. Did you get
all dark meat like I like?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.833
Yes, I ordered three full
rotisserie chickens worth

05:32.866 --> 05:34.568
of all dark meat.

05:34.602 --> 05:35.569
Where are the yams?

05:35.603 --> 05:36.570
They were
out of yams.

05:36.604 --> 05:37.605
I got you
creamed spinach.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.740
Did you go to the one
in Stroudsburg?
Yes.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.775
And they had no yams?
They had no yams.

05:41.809 --> 05:42.876
How strange.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.678
Because they always
have yams.

05:45.879 --> 05:49.383
Oh, man, is that
a Prism Duro Sport?

05:49.417 --> 05:50.751
You've seen
one of these?

05:50.784 --> 05:53.687
Yeah, they're like an iPod,
only they're better.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.023
'Cause they're chunkier
and more solid.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.491
Roy gave it to me
for Christmas.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.059
I'm trying to figure out
how to put songs on it.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.829
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go there.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.631
I know this
Russian website

06:03.664 --> 06:06.400
where you can download songs
for two cents apiece.

06:06.434 --> 06:09.570
Really?
Yeah, I'll write down
the address for you.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.805
Only the only thing is...

06:11.839 --> 06:14.775
is that all the songs
are in Russian.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.447
Kidding!

06:19.480 --> 06:20.681
Oh...oh!

06:21.815 --> 06:23.417
Why would they
all be...

06:26.086 --> 06:28.456
Okay, see you later, Pan.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.662
Pan?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.697
Pam!

06:36.730 --> 06:38.666
Pam?

06:39.800 --> 06:40.901
Oh, God.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.772
What?

06:44.805 --> 06:46.073
Come here, please.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.576
Tell me
before I come there.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.711
I want you
to rub butter on my foot.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.712
No.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.680
Pam, please.

06:52.713 --> 06:53.781
I have Country Crock.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.716
No.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.089
Ryan!

07:02.122 --> 07:03.991
Ryan!

07:04.024 --> 07:05.926
Ryan!

07:05.959 --> 07:07.795
These covers...

07:07.828 --> 07:09.697
are totally indestructible.

07:09.730 --> 07:10.498
Really?
Yeah.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.601
Throw it.
I promise it won't break.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.735
Chuck it.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.475
Oh, no, it's broken.

07:21.509 --> 07:22.576
What?

07:22.610 --> 07:23.944
No, it's fine.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.245
I told you
it wouldn't break.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.714
You could throw it
all day long.

07:26.747 --> 07:27.981
That is so cool.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.117
Thanks, Dwight.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.719
You're welcome.

07:33.754 --> 07:37.591
So I guess Pam and Dwight
are friends now.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.627
Oh, God, no.
Dwight isn't my friend.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.765
Oh, my God...
Dwight's kind of my friend!

07:44.798 --> 07:48.902
No, no--no one is helping me
out at all, Mom.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.272
No, I'm not gonna
call Jan.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.574
She'd just worry.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.776
Drive down here
and make a big thing.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.747
Who told you that?

07:59.780 --> 08:03.050
No, it was mutual.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.085
What is Pam doing
chatting with you?

08:10.691 --> 08:14.728
Hmm.
Do you like candy?

08:14.762 --> 08:16.697
It's all right.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.232
'Cause you're
sweeter than candy.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.001
What is wrong with you?

08:23.270 --> 08:25.105
Hey, cut--

08:52.132 --> 08:54.735
Wow, you just
dive right in.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.336
You know, around age 12,

08:56.369 --> 08:57.571
I just started
going for it, you know?

08:57.605 --> 08:58.572
Help!

09:01.274 --> 09:04.144
Oh, help! Help me!

09:04.177 --> 09:05.846
What

09:05.879 --> 09:07.648
I fell off
the toilet.

09:07.681 --> 09:12.252
I'm caught between
the toilet and the wall.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.721
What do you need?

09:13.754 --> 09:15.589
Not you.
Someone else.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.790
Get Pam.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.792
I don't think Pam's gonna wanna
come into the men's room.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.160
Get Ryan.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.962
He needs to lift me!

09:21.995 --> 09:23.897
And he needs to
clean me up a little bit.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.766
Bring a wet towel.

09:25.799 --> 09:29.269
Ryan is, uh...dead.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.304
No, he's not.
I just saw him.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.873
No. He's...

09:32.906 --> 09:34.608
Can you just
get up yourself?

09:34.642 --> 09:37.044
I--you only
grilled your foot.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.879
Oh, forget it.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.614
I'll just get up myself.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.282
Ohh! Oww!

09:44.652 --> 09:47.287
Ow! Ow, God!

09:49.690 --> 09:51.892
Do you think Dwight's
being a little weird today?

09:51.925 --> 09:55.262
No...he's actually been
really nice and helpful.

09:55.295 --> 09:59.032
And that isn't weird?

09:59.066 --> 10:01.301
Well...

10:01.334 --> 10:04.337
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.640
Phyllis...Oscar...

10:06.674 --> 10:09.076
Ryan, who is supposed
to be dead.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.279
Can I ask you all
a question?

10:12.312 --> 10:14.848
Do you know what it's like
to be disabled?

10:14.882 --> 10:18.185
Um...I had scoliosis
as a girl.

10:18.218 --> 10:21.321
Never heard of it.
No...a real disability.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.322
Not a woman's trouble.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.758
When I was a teenager,
I was in an iron lung.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.794
Wha

10:26.827 --> 10:30.764
No, it--
Look, the point is...

10:30.798 --> 10:35.669
I am the only one here
who has a legitimate disability.

10:35.703 --> 10:40.273
Although I'm sure Stanley has
had his fair share of obstacles.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.110
I'm not disabled,
and neither are you.

10:43.143 --> 10:47.280
Okay, what does this look like
to you, Stanley?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.449
Mail Boxes, Etc.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.852
Shut...it.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.821
Okay.
Well...

10:53.854 --> 10:55.455
Well, you know what?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.324
Disabilities

10:57.357 --> 10:59.359
are not things
to be laughed at

10:59.392 --> 11:01.361
or laughed about.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.396
You people are jerks.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.299
Imagine if you had
left Stevie Wonder

11:06.333 --> 11:08.301
on the floor of that bathroom
instead of me.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.804
Oh, we wouldn't.
We love Stevie Wonder.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.944
I burned my foot!

11:16.977 --> 11:19.479
Okay, 20 minutes,
conference room.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.414
Everybody's in there!

11:23.250 --> 11:24.317
Dad?

11:28.088 --> 11:29.823
While we are waiting

11:29.857 --> 11:31.825
for our special guests
to arrive,

11:31.859 --> 11:33.761
I wanted you all
to take a look

11:33.794 --> 11:37.765
at a few of the many,
many disabled icons

11:37.798 --> 11:40.400
who have contributed
so much to our society.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.169
Quick question.
Yeah?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.370
Why is Tom Hanks
on the wall?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.739
Twice.
Good question.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.508
Forrest Gump,
mentally challenged.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.944
Philadelphia...
AIDS.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.512
I think that's from Big.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.515
I don't think so, no.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.450
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano
with Robert Loggia.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.753
He grew into a man
overnight.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.454
A rare disability.
It still works.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.358
A crossword puzzle, Stanley?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.761
Seriously, are you learning
nothing here?

12:07.795 --> 12:08.796
Mm-hmm.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.798
What do you mean,
"Mm

12:10.831 --> 12:12.099
I mean I'm learning nothing.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.400
Okay.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.902
Michael Scott.
I'm looking for Michael Scott.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.403
Yes, right in here.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.005
Good.
Come on in.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.039
Great.

12:19.072 --> 12:23.076
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is our special guest.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.144
Sorry I'm late.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.514
Somebody parked in
the handicapped parking space.

12:27.547 --> 12:28.916
Oh.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.918
Hey, everyone.
I'm Billy Merchant.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.485
You may have seen me
around here before.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.355
I'm the properties manager
of this office park.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.489
You are so brave.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.925
You are so brave.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.459
Thank you.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.294
Actually, I've been meaning to
come by here for a long time--

12:41.328 --> 12:42.395
But it's hard for you,
right?

12:42.429 --> 12:44.097
Because you're in a wheelchair.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.466
No, I just have a lot
of properties to manage.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.268
Let me ask you something.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.570
How long does it take
for you to do something simple?

12:50.603 --> 12:53.473
Every day, like--like brush
your teeth in the morning.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.508
I don't know,
like, 30 seconds.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.944
Oh, my God.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.979
That's three times
as long as it takes me.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.448
How did you

13:01.481 --> 13:02.515
get in your wheelchair?

13:02.549 --> 13:04.051
This morning?

13:04.084 --> 13:05.452
Just like every other morning.
Just climbed on in.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.856
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Not funny, not funny!

13:08.889 --> 13:10.824
Hey, hey, relax just, uh...

13:10.858 --> 13:12.092
joking around here.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.126
Well, that's good.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.928
He still has
a sense of humor.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.329
Listen, I've actually
used a chair

13:16.363 --> 13:18.098
since I was
four years old.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.399
I don't really
notice it anymore.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.467
Well, they do.
They notice it.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.102
Don't you?
You notice it.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.236
It's the first thing
you saw

13:23.270 --> 13:25.238
when he rolled in here,
isn't it?

13:25.272 --> 13:29.009
I wanna clamp Michael's face
in a George Foreman Grill.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.277
So there are just
a couple things

13:30.310 --> 13:31.311
I wanted
to remind everybody of.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.313
First is parking.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.948
You can't block
the freight entrance

13:34.982 --> 13:36.583
with your car,
even if your blinkers are on.

13:36.616 --> 13:39.419
Does anybody
have any questions?

13:39.452 --> 13:41.421
Yes?

13:41.454 --> 13:43.023
Yeah?

13:43.056 --> 13:46.259
Yes?

13:46.293 --> 13:48.095
Dwight, you have
your hand up.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.900
Ignore him.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.401
You know what?

13:54.434 --> 13:55.402
We're not that different,

13:55.435 --> 13:56.403
you and I.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.404
When I clamped

13:57.437 --> 13:59.472
my foot
into a non-stick--

13:59.506 --> 14:00.941
You know what,
Michael?
Yeah?

14:00.974 --> 14:04.377
Let me stop you right there,
and leave.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.280
Did you see
Born on the Fourth of July?

14:07.314 --> 14:09.049
I was under the impression
that Billy would be

14:09.082 --> 14:10.283
more like that guy.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.885
What's wrong
with that guy?

14:11.919 --> 14:13.086
You mean today?

14:13.120 --> 14:15.388
He stepped on a George Foreman
Grill and he burned his foot.

14:15.422 --> 14:16.389
No, not Michael.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.226
The moon-faced kid
who crashed into the pole.

14:21.328 --> 14:24.297
He looks like
he has a concussion.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.169
Hey!

14:29.202 --> 14:30.904
I found the pudding cups
you wanted

14:30.938 --> 14:33.040
at a gas station
in Carbondale!

14:33.073 --> 14:35.342
You did it.
Look at you.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.477
And with the plate
and the napkin.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.246
Very nice.
Thank you, Ryan.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.148
You're very welcome.
Did you get the yams?

14:41.181 --> 14:43.250
No, the gas station
in Carbondale

14:43.283 --> 14:44.684
did not have fresh yams.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.586
Okay.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.921
I'll just have the pudding.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.089
You sure?
Yeah.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.123
Okay.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.325
You know what?
I feel better.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.127
Ryan brought me
some chocolate pudding,

14:54.161 --> 14:56.629
and his kindness
healed my foot.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.399
Yeah, baby!

14:59.432 --> 15:01.134
I am feelin' better.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.302
My body's literally

15:02.335 --> 15:04.337
healing itself.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.339
It is amazing what
the human body is capable of

15:06.373 --> 15:07.707
when you have
a powerful brain.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.211
I ground up
four extra-strength aspirin

15:11.244 --> 15:13.146
and put them
in Michael's pudding.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.381
I do the same thing
with my dog

15:14.414 --> 15:17.384
to get him to take
his heartworm medicine.

15:17.417 --> 15:21.454
Ohh, finally feel the blood
coursing through my foot veins.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.622
Ohh!

15:23.991 --> 15:26.059
Oh! Okay, I think
we need to take him

15:26.093 --> 15:27.494
to the hospital, because...

15:27.527 --> 15:29.362
I'm pretty sure
he has a concussion.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.597
Oh, now you feel

15:30.630 --> 15:32.065
some compassion for him.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.133
He needs to go
right now.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.301
And you're his
emergency contact.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.368
I think you should
go with him.

15:35.402 --> 15:36.336
Why don't you
go with him?

15:36.369 --> 15:38.705
I...barely know him.
I want Michael to take me.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.507
I can't take you.
I don't have my car.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.275
Please?
And yours is all vomity.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.543
You can take my van!

15:43.576 --> 15:45.245
Oh, okay.
That's great.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.180
No, I can't drive.
Jim, why don't you drive?

15:47.214 --> 15:49.716
Fine.
We'll go.
I'm still recovering.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.185
So let's just--Ryan,
can you get my coat, please?

15:52.219 --> 15:53.753
Slowly. Let's just
get to the elevator.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.388
What are you doing?

15:55.422 --> 15:57.290
Vietnam sounds.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.992
Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.294
Tired.
Can't lay down.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.562
Just take a rake--
Wake up!

16:02.595 --> 16:04.197
Ahh!
Wait, here,
let me help you, Dwight.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.398
Come on.
Get up.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.466
Thanks.
Get up.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.068
You're the best.
Yeah.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.169
It smells
like chicken soup.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.203
I know.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.538
I have to go
to the hospital.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.706
I know.
Where are we going?

16:13.740 --> 16:15.242
I just wanna
say good

16:15.275 --> 16:16.643
I'll be back, I mean...
Yes, I know.

16:16.676 --> 16:17.744
But it's gonna be
different.

16:17.777 --> 16:18.745
Why?

16:18.778 --> 16:20.547
It's just
hard to explain.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.582
Oh, Pam, you're adorable.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.717
Oh, my goodness.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.086
Come here.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.055
Ohh.
Huggy hugs.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.123
Shotgun!

16:30.157 --> 16:32.459
You don't think you should
sit in the back with Dwight?

16:33.593 --> 16:36.296
The rules of shotgun
are very simple and very clear.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.498
The first person
to shout shotgun

16:38.531 --> 16:40.267
when you're within
the sight of the car

16:40.300 --> 16:42.069
gets the front seat.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.470
That's how
the game's played.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.339
There are no exceptions
for someone with a concussion.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.441
Oh, God, a minivan.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.710
What is Meredith's problem?

16:50.743 --> 16:52.345
Well, I think
she has a kid.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.314
Yeah, she has one kid
and no husband.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.483
She's not gonna find one
driving this thing around.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.584
Where are we going?

16:57.617 --> 16:58.651
Come on.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.253
Get inside.
Where are we going?

17:00.287 --> 17:02.055
We're going
to Chuck E. Cheese.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.156
Chuck E. Cheese?
Oh, God.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.225
I'm so sick
of Chuck E. Cheese.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.826
We're going to the hospital,
Michael.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.196
I know.
I'm just sayin'...

17:11.431 --> 17:12.432
Dwight,
what are you drinking?

17:12.465 --> 17:13.500
I found it
under the seat.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.302
Oh, my God.
Dwight.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.336
Put that down.
I'm thirsty.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.170
Noo!
Give the bottle
to Michael.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.605
Noo!
Just give
the bottle to Michael.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.073
Just give it to me--
I'm thirsty!

17:20.107 --> 17:21.241
Just keep your eyes
on the road.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.842
Give me the bottle,
or you're fired!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.711
You can't fire me.
I don't work in this van.

17:24.744 --> 17:25.812
Give it to me,
Dwight!

17:25.845 --> 17:26.746
No, stop.
Give me the bottle!

17:26.779 --> 17:29.149
Will you stop?
Give me the bottle, Dwight!

17:29.182 --> 17:30.217
Michael, stop!
Just give it!

17:30.250 --> 17:31.684
Michael, stop!
Just...stop it!

17:31.718 --> 17:34.087
Stop spraying!
Give me the bottle!

17:34.121 --> 17:35.588
Stop!
Stop spraying me!

17:35.622 --> 17:37.090
Give me the bottle!

17:37.124 --> 17:39.226
Dwight, what is
your middle name?

17:39.259 --> 17:41.328
Danger.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.096
Something with a "K."

17:43.130 --> 17:44.397
It's Kurt.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.399
Wow, I'm so sad
that I know that.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.536
What do I write under
reason for visit?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.171
Concussion.

17:53.540 --> 17:54.674
What did you write?

17:54.707 --> 17:57.344
Ahem, nothing.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.313
I wrote "bringing someone
to the hospital."

18:00.347 --> 18:01.514
So you thought they meant
your reason

18:01.548 --> 18:02.515
for coming to the hospital.

18:02.549 --> 18:03.683
No, no.
You know what, Jim?

18:03.716 --> 18:06.153
This isn't about
me anymore.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.854
I made
a miraculous recovery,

18:07.887 --> 18:09.656
which is more than
I can say for him.

18:09.689 --> 18:10.690
Come on, Dwight.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.526
Hi, Michael.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.328
Hi, Dwight.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.796
Ahh.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.498
Uhh.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.900
Doctor, what
is more serious,

18:20.933 --> 18:22.835
a head injury
or a foot injury?

18:22.869 --> 18:23.803
A head injury.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.472
Well, you don't
have all the information.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.274
The foot has been
fairly severely burned,

18:27.307 --> 18:29.209
and, uh, healed quickly.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.076
Very quickly.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.911
Actually, like,
suspiciously quickly.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.147
So I'm ordering
a CAT scan.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.548
What is that?

18:35.582 --> 18:38.651
Look, since you have
the machine up and running,

18:38.685 --> 18:39.919
can I just
stick my foot in?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.488
We can take a look.
Well...

18:41.521 --> 18:42.789
For a burn,
you really just need

18:42.822 --> 18:44.224
to look at the outside
of the foot.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.925
Okay, what kind
of machine is that?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.161
Does the skin look
red and swollen?

18:48.195 --> 18:49.596
That's what she said.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.199
That's my joke.
Damn it, Dwight.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.503
Okay, no electronics
past this point.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.737
Camera, sound equipment.

18:57.770 --> 18:58.738
It's okay,
they're with me.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.174
No metal of any kind.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.643
All right, well, I guess
this is where we leave you off.

19:03.676 --> 19:04.544
I don't wanna do this.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.745
Uh, well, you should have
thought of that

19:05.778 --> 19:09.216
before you crashed your head
on your way to pick me up, so...

19:09.249 --> 19:12.452
We'll...see you
when you get out.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.686
Oh.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.158
Fine. Fine.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.906
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.508
Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.444
Oh, my God,
what's going on?

19:37.477 --> 19:38.511
Is Dwight okay?

19:38.545 --> 19:39.679
Mm-hmm,
he should be fine.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.614
But they brought him in
for a CAT scan.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.750
I can't believe he's
getting a CAT scan.

19:43.783 --> 19:44.917
Michael went in there
with him too.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.519
It's pretty sweet.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.855
Really? Michael went in
with him? Wow.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.323
But they shouldn't
be much longer now.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.491
So we'll be back soon.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.293
Okay, that's...good news.

19:53.326 --> 19:56.763
Um, uh, yeah, no.
I'll let you go.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.764
Okay. Bye.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.198
Bye.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.274
Hey, Oscar?

20:07.307 --> 20:08.341
What's up, Pam?

20:08.375 --> 20:09.876
Um, I just wanted
to let you know

20:09.909 --> 20:10.977
that Dwight's
gonna be okay.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.912
The doctor said there's
a really simple treatment

20:12.945 --> 20:15.315
for a concussion,
so he'll probably even

20:15.348 --> 20:16.783
be back
at work tomorrow.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.017
Okay.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.620
I just, uh, thought
you'd wanna know that.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.559
Okay, Mr. Schrute.

20:26.593 --> 20:27.594
Inhale with me

20:27.627 --> 20:28.595
on three.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.563
One, two...

20:30.597 --> 20:32.031
Sir, stop that.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.866
Stop...

20:33.900 --> 20:35.902
Stop that.
