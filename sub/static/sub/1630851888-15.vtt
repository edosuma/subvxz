20:52.575 --> 20:57.672
every meal by himself,
that is a lonely life,

20:57.747 --> 21:00.082
but that's
not the life that I want.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.419
I do want a life partner
and I really feel like

21:03.428 --> 21:07.256
I should be happily married
and, for whatever reason,

21:45.295 --> 21:49.640
Your car would get

and this is what
I'm doing today with my wife

22:11.163 --> 22:15.240
so she can kind of see who I am
or how I am the way I am.

22:15.250 --> 22:19.837
I used to get into fights
mostly in there, mainly because

22:19.913 --> 22:24.008
we used to play basketball,
you know, a shopping cart?

22:24.084 --> 22:27.336
We used to flip it over
and hang it on a gate

22:27.420 --> 22:29.430
and that's what we'd hoop at.
- Okay.

22:29.506 --> 22:32.591
- And so obviously, kids,
we used to get into fights

22:32.675 --> 22:35.770
over basketball games
or just people, you know,

22:35.845 --> 22:37.855
people talking noise, bullying.

22:37.931 --> 22:40.182
I hung out with
a pretty rough crowd.

22:40.266 --> 22:43.018
I was doing stuff
with my friends that,

22:43.028 --> 22:44.686
mm, looking back on it,

22:44.696 --> 22:45.696
I don't think we should
have been doing that stuff.

22:45.772 --> 22:48.023
[laughter]

22:48.108 --> 22:50.442
But, um, it's cool, it's cool.

22:50.452 --> 22:55.114
And so that is my apartment.

22:55.123 --> 22:57.866
Well, that's where I grew up,
and that's

22:57.876 --> 23:02.621
actually the apartment
where my dad was shot.

23:02.705 --> 23:04.706
If you walk in the apartment,
as soon as you open

23:04.716 --> 23:06.875
the door,
it's the living room, right,

23:06.885 --> 23:09.970
and there was a couch
on the right hand side.

23:10.046 --> 23:12.973
Well, I was sleeping
on that couch

23:13.049 --> 23:15.059
when they kicked in the door.

23:15.135 --> 23:16.969
So literally,
they kicked in the door

23:16.978 --> 23:18.971
and they walked right past me.

23:18.980 --> 23:23.067
And they hit that corner and
then my dad opened the door,

23:23.143 --> 23:26.562
and when he opened the door,
he saw the guys.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.230
He saw them and then he
closed the door, and then he

23:28.240 --> 23:30.324
put us back to the door

23:30.400 --> 23:34.069
and the guy shot at the door.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.747
Like, it was like six
or seven bullets and like,

23:36.832 --> 23:39.750
one of them hit my dad
in the neck.

23:39.826 --> 23:42.995
And then he ran off,
so that's when I called 911.

23:43.079 --> 23:45.581
I remember being in the back
of the ambulance,

23:45.590 --> 23:48.843
but I don't--it was
so much commotion going on.

23:48.918 --> 23:53.013
I remember the medics,
you know, stopping--

23:53.089 --> 23:55.591
Stopping the bleed,
wrapping him up,

23:55.675 --> 23:58.677
and we was just hauling.
And um...

23:58.687 --> 24:00.762
I was sitting there
in the waiting room

24:00.772 --> 24:03.941
and then like, maybe 20 minutes,

24:04.017 --> 24:06.527
the doctor came and told me,
you know, your dad passed.

24:06.603 --> 24:08.612
And I was like, okay.

24:11.608 --> 24:13.358
I didn't know--I didn't
know how to react to that,

24:13.368 --> 24:15.527
like, I was kind of like--
- Well, you were young, so...

24:15.612 --> 24:18.622
- I was like, "Okay,"
like it didn't even hit me.

24:18.707 --> 24:22.284
It didn't hit me
for like two weeks.

24:22.368 --> 24:24.879
<i>- Although we both lost our
fathers, you know, losing your</i>

24:24.954 --> 24:26.705

still need your father to be

around and a role model,

24:28.625 --> 24:31.960

It is really nice to see
where your roots are, like,

24:37.309 --> 24:40.469
where you grew up, and where,
like, life molded you.

24:40.479 --> 24:44.231
- I've told people the story
of my dad passing away,

24:44.307 --> 24:49.820
but I've
never brought anybody here.

24:49.896 --> 24:52.814
Never, like,

24:52.824 --> 24:55.826
<i>We all have
experiences in our past that</i>

24:55.902 --> 24:59.997
might be challenging
to talk to someone with.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.241
But, you know,
one of the reasons why I

25:02.250 --> 25:04.409
decided I wanted to be
married at first sight is so I

25:04.494 --> 25:06.161
could find somebody that

25:06.171 --> 25:08.172
<i>I could be able to talk to,
and feel</i>

25:08.248 --> 25:10.841
comfortable with, and have
those tough conversations and

25:10.917 --> 25:14.512
hope that they can empathize
with me and be there for me.

25:14.587 --> 25:17.848
Damn, I always wonder about
how my life would have been

25:17.924 --> 25:19.925
if he was still alive.

25:20.009 --> 25:22.019

different, for sure.

in our marriage, is what I saw,
and that's teamwork.

25:59.549 --> 26:01.049
You know,
I think the whole reason why

26:01.059 --> 26:02.801
my parents moved here is because

26:02.811 --> 26:04.812
the Pearland school district
was good and so they're like,

26:04.887 --> 26:06.647
you know,
we're gonna move to Pearland,

26:06.731 --> 26:08.223
and you're gonna go to,
you know, go to school and get

26:08.233 --> 26:11.318
good grades, and be in sports
and stay out of trouble.

26:11.394 --> 26:13.237
It was significant enough for us

26:13.313 --> 26:16.407
to know that, oh, our parents
want us to succeed.

26:16.482 --> 26:18.325
Fast forward, my sister--
We both have degrees,

26:18.401 --> 26:20.569
we're both very educated
and, I mean,

26:20.579 --> 26:24.239
they sacrificed a lot, too,
to build this house.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.908
- I didn't know that
it was built, you know,

26:26.918 --> 26:28.744
from the ground up so
I mean, this house is

26:28.753 --> 26:32.256
kind of a reflection
of your parents' taste.

26:32.332 --> 26:36.168
Even though both our parents
are separated and divorced,

26:36.177 --> 26:40.505
we both experienced a good,
wholesome family times and we

26:40.590 --> 26:44.092
know what--when it's good,
what it looks like,

26:44.177 --> 26:48.105
what it should look like, so at
least we had that to look back.

26:48.189 --> 26:51.350
So no, I really appreciate
you bringing me here.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.101
- So you want to go inside?

26:53.111 --> 26:55.613

wanted to go to take these.

27:02.362 --> 27:04.455
- These little glamour
shots--of course,

27:04.539 --> 27:06.531
I didn't have a beard either,
so...

27:06.616 --> 27:08.125
- You were starting to,
you know, peach fuzz.

27:08.209 --> 27:09.543
- Yeah,
I got a little peach fuzz.

27:09.619 --> 27:11.045
Got a little peach fuzz, yeah.

27:11.120 --> 27:14.623
- Oh, my God,
you looked so cool.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.458
How old were you there?

27:16.468 --> 27:17.968
- I have my ears pierced
then so I don't know,

27:18.044 --> 27:19.044
I guess I was like...

27:19.054 --> 27:21.138
- You had your ears pierced?

27:21.214 --> 27:22.798
- Yeah, matter of fact,
you know the story about that?

27:22.882 --> 27:24.716
I did it myself in this house.
- [sighs]

27:24.801 --> 27:27.135
- I was in--
I was in third, fourth grade.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.054
I pierced it with a needle here.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.147
It was funny because I did it

27:30.231 --> 27:31.231
and then one
of the neighborhood kids

27:31.307 --> 27:32.733
tried to do it too,
and he couldn't.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.142
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.811
- Oh, yeah, yeah, so...

27:35.820 --> 27:38.322
- That was a thing.
- So yeah, I guess like...

27:38.398 --> 27:41.149
- The parts that I'm enjoying
the most is really seeing

27:41.159 --> 27:46.488
the pictures and, you know,
which pictures made the frames.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.750
I always feel, you know
if a picture is framed,

27:49.834 --> 27:52.169
<i>it must mean something
more than, you know,</i>

27:52.245 --> 27:54.004
<i>all your other pictures,</i>

27:54.080 --> 27:56.581
and I love behind every picture
he is sharing a story.

27:56.666 --> 27:59.677
So what were, like,
typical meals during the week?

27:59.752 --> 28:02.587
- So you know, we weren't
like super well off, of course,

28:02.597 --> 28:05.099
mind you, we just built this
house so we didn't have much

28:05.174 --> 28:08.352
money right?
So we ate rice and beans like

28:08.436 --> 28:12.940
every single day because
we were not very well off.

28:13.015 --> 28:14.692
It's like hey,
you can get a bunch

28:14.776 --> 28:16.360
of rice
and a bunch of beans for,

28:16.436 --> 28:18.946
like, pretty cheap,
and you can eat that all week.

28:19.021 --> 28:23.283
- Eating rice and beans made
you feel like, oh, this is what

28:23.368 --> 28:26.695
we have to eat because
maybe there's not enough money?

28:26.705 --> 28:30.449
I never saw rice and beans as,
like, not having money thing,

28:30.533 --> 28:32.868
it was just like, oh,

28:32.952 --> 28:36.872
we're being really Hispanic
right now.

28:36.956 --> 28:38.632
You know,
like, this is what, you know,

28:38.708 --> 28:41.802
my culture eats and that's okay.

28:43.463 --> 28:47.048
<i>Something that I found

that's having a lot, you know?

28:57.569 --> 29:01.572
So it gets me wondering,
what is he comparing this to?

29:01.656 --> 29:04.324
What does it look

Most of the people in my life
do not know the depths

29:51.697 --> 29:55.209
of where I came from because
so much about my childhood

29:55.284 --> 29:59.546
brought me grief
and shame and hurt.

29:59.622 --> 30:02.132

important for my husband

30:13.052 --> 30:17.222
to understand that I'm
multi-layered and these layers,

30:17.232 --> 30:20.225

30:20.309 --> 30:21.985
That tree right there
with the little rope,

30:22.061 --> 30:24.154
that was my favorite tree.

30:24.230 --> 30:27.324
It was right in front
of the trailer I grew up in.

30:27.408 --> 30:29.568
The trailer was to the left.

30:29.652 --> 30:31.152
- Wish I could see it.

30:31.237 --> 30:35.740
- Yeah, well,
I actually have pictures.

30:35.825 --> 30:37.668
It was 50 years old already
when my dad bought it.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.837
It was in pretty bad shape.

30:39.921 --> 30:42.172
That's the front,
that's the porch.

30:42.257 --> 30:46.001
We used to hide under here.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.169
This is the tree,
that big tree I said I like.

30:48.254 --> 30:50.430
This property had pear trees,

30:50.515 --> 30:53.174
peach trees, all kinds of trees,

30:53.184 --> 30:56.854
and we had so much fruit
that I would just hock it out

30:56.929 --> 31:00.181
into the street, like,
I just found [bleep] to do.

31:00.266 --> 31:02.943
We used to have
the biggest bonfires.

31:03.027 --> 31:05.195
I used to build

31:05.271 --> 31:09.274
a big straw hut for my, like,
generic Barbies

31:09.358 --> 31:13.453
and I put them in there and I'd
set the whole thing on fire.

31:13.538 --> 31:16.123
[laughs]
- What?

31:16.207 --> 31:18.116
- A lot of mischief
because, again,

31:18.200 --> 31:19.960
when you grow up on two acres
and have no friends,

31:20.044 --> 31:22.203
that's what it is.

31:22.288 --> 31:27.384

42:15.691 --> 42:17.951
You know, the vulnerabilities
you've shared,

42:18.026 --> 42:21.037
working to build
and maintain trust,

42:21.121 --> 42:24.541
those things that are
kind of the foundational level

42:24.625 --> 42:26.867
of being married.

42:26.877 --> 42:31.038
So let's take
a look at how well you've done.

42:31.048 --> 42:34.300
Rachel, looking into
what Jose's triggers are,

42:34.385 --> 42:37.545
what are the things that
are his points of vulnerability

42:37.629 --> 42:41.799
that you--you now know,
and what happened after that?

42:41.883 --> 42:44.561
- I've learned that when
it comes to triggers,

42:44.645 --> 42:49.056
it's definitely making
him talk or communicate when

42:49.141 --> 42:50.817
he's not ready to.

42:50.901 --> 42:53.060
I found
out that was the trigger,

42:53.070 --> 42:55.062
I found out what happens
when you don't give him space.

42:55.072 --> 42:58.408
He was like, "Look,
if I get past this point,

42:58.492 --> 43:01.995
I'm gonna say something,
basically, I'm gonna regret.

43:02.070 --> 43:04.414
And I believed him
and I'm like, okay, like,

43:04.498 --> 43:06.249
I don't want to find out,
you know,

43:06.325 --> 43:09.669
and so I learned, yeah,
definitely give him space,

43:09.745 --> 43:11.588
give him time,

43:11.663 --> 43:15.592
and not immediately go
into this feeling of rejection.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.836
This is why I was avoiding
giving him that space

43:18.920 --> 43:22.098
because I didn't want
to feel that rejection

43:22.182 --> 43:25.092
of "he's mad and he
doesn't want to talk to me,

43:25.102 --> 43:28.605
like, he must not want
to be with me anymore."

43:28.689 --> 43:30.356
And now, I'm like, you know,
if he needs his space,

43:30.441 --> 43:32.525
we just watch TV,
and then he's like,

43:32.601 --> 43:35.111
"I didn't like how
you did this today."

43:35.187 --> 43:38.448
And I'm like, "oh, wow."
It showed me that it works.

43:38.523 --> 43:41.117
- So that sounds really great,
I mean, that's the kind

43:41.193 --> 43:43.453
of growth that you want
in a relationship where

43:43.537 --> 43:45.872
you start
to learn from each other.

43:45.947 --> 43:49.450
Now, how do I not be
overbearing and do too

43:49.460 --> 43:51.535
much for my wife,
have you found out?

43:51.620 --> 43:52.787
- Yeah, so I think it was just

43:52.871 --> 43:54.872
us having just the conversation,

43:54.882 --> 43:58.217
and how much should I be doing,
and where do I scale back?

43:58.293 --> 44:00.053
It was it was things like,
you know,

44:00.128 --> 44:02.963
early on, even
on the honeymoon, you know,

44:02.973 --> 44:04.465
she addressed,
she didn't want to be fed.

44:04.475 --> 44:06.643
And I was doing it only
because I wanted to give

44:06.727 --> 44:08.552
her whatever I had.

44:08.562 --> 44:11.806
- And for me, it was like,
take it down a little bit so I

44:11.815 --> 44:14.392
can meet you there too,
you know, because it

44:14.476 --> 44:17.070
was very much of like,
just sit here and I'll do

44:17.145 --> 44:19.656
everything and I'm like,
"Oh no, I don't like that."

44:19.740 --> 44:22.400
- Well, he said he
wanted a modern woman,

44:22.484 --> 44:24.485
but he forgot that he
was a traditional guy.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.237
[laughter]

44:26.321 --> 44:27.747
So there's had to be
a little growth there?

44:27.831 --> 44:29.499
- Yeah, absolutely.

44:29.574 --> 44:31.334
And yes,
I did want an independent

44:31.410 --> 44:34.253
woman, and I got that,
and we're actually doing it

44:34.338 --> 44:38.082
together and we've found
a little bit of a happy medium.

44:38.166 --> 44:41.094
- So he's trusting your opinion
more, he's listening more?

44:41.169 --> 44:42.837
- Mm-hmm, yes.

44:42.846 --> 44:45.348
- So I think you guys
are doing extremely well

44:45.424 --> 44:47.266
and building it well.

44:47.342 --> 44:49.176
I do want to see

44:49.186 --> 44:51.938
told each other secrets
that are hard to tell

44:54.191 --> 44:56.859

marriage profound is

you--you show some

That night, Zackary

46:34.366 --> 46:37.293
One is that it always
stays civil, and secondly,

46:37.369 --> 46:40.129
that you don't interrupt
so everybody gets to feel

46:40.205 --> 46:43.549
like they have been able
to express themselves fully.

46:43.625 --> 46:46.803
I'm trying to get
your goals fulfilled.

46:46.962 --> 46:49.305
Tell me what your goals are
for this meeting.

46:49.381 --> 46:51.474
- Right, so essentially,
my goals with Michaela are

46:51.550 --> 46:54.310
to essentially--to talk
about how we've gotten to this

46:54.469 --> 46:57.972
point and, you know,
what lessons we can take from

46:57.981 --> 47:02.059
this to kind of better
ourselves going forward.

47:02.069 --> 47:05.396
And if there's anything
we could have done differently,

47:05.405 --> 47:09.158
you could say anything, it's
not gonna hurt my feelings.

47:11.570 --> 47:16.073

47:16.083 --> 47:20.002

to talk to you about this.

47:37.429 --> 47:38.771

47:38.847 --> 47:40.097

47:41.692 --> 47:46.020

That was me trying.

47:46.113 --> 47:48.606
For Zackary,
there was no coming back,

47:48.615 --> 47:50.691
and I understood that,

47:50.701 --> 47:54.028
and I accepted that,
and I accept it now.

47:55.030 --> 47:58.365
- I think you would agree
that I put in as much effort

47:58.375 --> 48:02.879
and willingness as you did, and
I don't want that to ever be

48:03.038 --> 48:06.132
lost--I never want you to look
back at this and think like,

48:06.207 --> 48:07.791
you know, Zack
just never gave me a chance

48:07.876 --> 48:11.387
or Zack just didn't want me
because that wasn't the case.

48:11.546 --> 48:15.224
- Did you two give each
other enough affirmations?

48:15.383 --> 48:18.227
Did you tell him how great
he was at this or that?

48:18.303 --> 48:20.980
Did you tell her how
much you admire, like her,

48:21.056 --> 48:22.648
or thought, you know,
this--that was

48:22.724 --> 48:24.233
particularly smart
or interesting,

48:24.309 --> 48:26.485
did you guys give that
kind of back and forth?

48:26.561 --> 48:28.654
- Yeah, absolutely,
I know I did.

48:28.730 --> 48:31.231
I know she definitely did,
so yes.

48:31.241 --> 48:34.068
Our conversations
are mostly positive,

48:34.077 --> 48:35.819
we're not always arguing,
so yeah, I would definitely

48:35.913 --> 48:39.823
say we gave each other
affirmations most of the time.

48:39.833 --> 48:42.576
- So am I reading this right
that it was mostly positives,

48:42.586 --> 48:44.828
but these blow-ups
ruined it for you?

48:44.838 --> 48:47.757
If I could extract this out

48:47.832 --> 48:52.169
of the relationship,
would the marriage be good?

48:52.262 --> 48:54.505
- Correct, like I keep saying,
Michaela is an amazing person,

48:54.598 --> 48:56.423
she's the most thoughtful
woman I've ever met in my life,

48:56.433 --> 48:59.760
and this is worth
the sacrifice and fight,

48:59.770 --> 49:02.179
it's just, we, like--
We did talk about this

49:02.189 --> 49:03.356
throughout the whole process,

49:03.431 --> 49:04.857
we did talk about
how we can fix it,

49:04.933 --> 49:08.945
and it seems like
nothing was working.

49:09.020 --> 49:10.688
- Well, if it was an easy fix,
it would have already happened.

49:10.697 --> 49:13.273
- Right, true.
Yeah, that's true.

49:13.283 --> 49:15.785
- So we're talking about
tougher stuff and the question

49:15.944 --> 49:19.956
is, if you could--if you really
want to work with Michaela

49:20.115 --> 49:24.710
on this really big problem,
agree to work on this

49:24.786 --> 49:27.797

of some of the things that

49:31.718 --> 49:33.469
might have helped more,
honestly,

49:33.628 --> 49:35.295
that's my perspective.

49:35.305 --> 49:39.299

that perspective.

49:39.309 --> 49:42.311
My thing is,
I just want us to be able to be

49:42.387 --> 49:45.564

divorced or not divorced.

49:45.640 --> 49:47.817

just need to reiterate,

the time she goes into things

55:17.805 --> 55:22.151
It has to do with her mood.

55:22.226 --> 55:25.479
Because I try so hard
not for her to get like that

that, it kind of ruins whatever
