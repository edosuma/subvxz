He was my right-hand man.

01:31.482 --> 01:32.744

01:32.788 --> 01:35.138
Excellent way to repay
his loyalty, by the way.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.706
He went rogue.

01:37.749 --> 01:40.143
I have no idea
why he did what he did.

01:40.187 --> 01:43.799

01:47.977 --> 01:49.152
Yeah.

01:50.719 --> 01:53.156

01:58.205 --> 02:00.859
what sort of sick sense of humor
your father has.

02:00.903 --> 02:04.167
Which is why I'’m surprised
that you'’re working with Him.

02:05.516 --> 02:07.649
Well, there'’s no sense
in denying it now.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.085

02:09.129 --> 02:11.174

my devil face.

02:14.046 --> 02:17.354

He offer you in return?

02:17.398 --> 02:22.011
I would never work
for your father.

supposed to compete

09:02.019 --> 09:04.326
at the Huntington
Swell Classic later.

09:04.369 --> 09:07.764
If I can get him to voluntarily
turn over his surf leash,

09:07.808 --> 09:10.462
can you match that to the wound
on Manny'’s throat?

09:11.725 --> 09:12.943
Sure.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.380
Okay. I'’ll update
the lieutenant.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.821

What gives?

09:24.694 --> 09:26.696
Fine, don'’t tell me.

09:26.740 --> 09:29.656
Pierce yelled at me yesterday.

09:31.005 --> 09:34.051
He said that I talk too much.

09:35.923 --> 09:39.535
So I'’m trying to talk less.

If I fell apart
every time a man told me

what I was doing,

right now.

Uh, no, no. That'’s
not what I mean.

I-I just mean, why?

This, uh, about what
happened with the Sinnerman?

10:31.326 --> 10:34.111
It'’s about a lot of things.

would fix some of them,

Well, maybe you should take
some time to think about it.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.164
You know? Just, um...

10:43.207 --> 10:45.122
Look, I know how hard it is,

10:45.166 --> 10:47.559

to deal with a shooting,

It'’s chlamydia.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.625
Excuse me?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.366
It'’s a sexually

11:11.409 --> 11:13.020
Right, but I can'’t
have chlamydia.

how you got it?

in any risky sexual behavior?

with a prostitute.

But we have a mutual friend
that doesn'’t want us together,

and she is not one
to be trifled with, so...

12:02.069 --> 12:03.635
It'’s, um...

12:03.679 --> 12:05.681
complicated.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.379

Daniel. Sorry. Sorry, old habit.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.805
I think it'’s because
I'’m distressed,

18:30.848 --> 18:32.807
and I need your advice.

18:32.850 --> 18:35.026

18:35.070 --> 18:37.116
to offend the detective
more than anyone,

she actually divorced you.

to bounce back. How?

cream, homemade jam.

It'’s gone.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.653
Oh, boo-hoo.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.307
[scoffs]

29:04.351 --> 29:07.615
What about everything else
that happened to me?

29:09.008 --> 29:11.097
Honestly, I don'’t know.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.800
You'’re telling the truth.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.197
[exhales sharply]

29:27.722 --> 29:29.463
Stage one'’s complete.

29:29.506 --> 29:32.335
But I got to tell you,
I think these guys are all talk.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.381
I'’ve pissed every single one
of them off,

29:34.424 --> 29:35.861
and no one'’s moved yet.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.520
Oh, hey, guys.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.348
What'’s up?

29:48.699 --> 29:51.354
Dan?

29:51.398 --> 29:53.661
Dan, are you all right?

29:55.184 --> 29:57.708
Wow.

29:57.752 --> 30:00.407
I guess that means surf'’s up.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.849
I said, surf'’s up.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.851
Did I just
knock something loose,

30:09.895 --> 30:11.940
or are you always this lame?

30:11.984 --> 30:15.248
Well, you didn'’t think that a...

30:15.291 --> 30:17.772
that a punch was gonna
scare me off, did you?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.253
No.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.604
Should'’ve just
walked away, kook.

30:23.647 --> 30:25.998
I guess that'’s, uh...

30:26.041 --> 30:27.956
that'’s how it went down
for Moondog, huh?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.132
What'’d you say?

30:30.176 --> 30:35.137
I-I said that must have been
what you did to my boy Moondog.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.747
Before he died.

30:39.533 --> 30:40.751
Doesn'’t make any sense.

30:40.795 --> 30:42.144
I mean, there must
have been a reason

30:42.188 --> 30:43.580
my wings appeared
at that moment.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.017
There has to have been.

30:45.060 --> 30:48.150
Maybe, but it wasn'’t
because of me.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.503
I lost audio on Dan.
What'’s going on?

30:53.547 --> 30:55.114
Is that blood?

30:55.157 --> 30:56.289
Well, I mean, that could mean

30:56.332 --> 30:57.943
any number of things,
couldn'’t it?

30:59.683 --> 31:01.990
They couldn'’t have
gotten far. He'’s injured.

31:09.171 --> 31:11.870
What in the hell
are they doing?

31:22.968 --> 31:25.884
It'’s a paddle-out ceremony.

31:27.624 --> 31:31.063
WILDCHILD: When you told us
Manny was dead, I was stunned.

31:31.106 --> 31:33.282
'’Cause Moondog was like
one of us--

31:33.326 --> 31:37.069
a free spirit who wanted
to be one with the ocean.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.682
At least now we know he is.

31:41.725 --> 31:44.554
Go ahead.

31:44.598 --> 31:46.643
Say something.

31:46.687 --> 31:49.211
Uh...

31:49.255 --> 31:51.692
Manny was...

31:51.735 --> 31:53.172
a great guy.

31:53.215 --> 31:55.522
And he meant

31:55.565 --> 31:58.264
so much to...

31:58.307 --> 31:59.656
a lot of people,

31:59.700 --> 32:00.875
which is why

32:00.919 --> 32:02.921
I came here today
to find his killer.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.708
I thought it was
one of you guys.

32:07.751 --> 32:10.363
Why would you think that, man?

32:10.406 --> 32:12.191
'’Cause he was strangled
by a surf leash.

32:12.234 --> 32:13.975
And the Orcas'’ tags
are all over Carbon,

32:14.019 --> 32:16.935
which is where
his body was found.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.240
That'’s crazy.

32:18.284 --> 32:21.852
Yeah, maybe,
but I saw it myself.

32:21.896 --> 32:24.116
We don'’t
go up to Carbon.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.509
Those private beaches
are all blocked off.

32:26.553 --> 32:28.685
Those rich snobs make it clear
we'’re not welcome there,

32:28.729 --> 32:30.861
so why bother?

32:32.646 --> 32:35.040
The ocean'’s a big place.

32:37.259 --> 32:39.218
[sighs]
Now, enough of that.

32:39.261 --> 32:42.438
Let'’s take this moment.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.440
For Moondog.

32:46.703 --> 32:47.966
For Moondog.

32:48.009 --> 32:50.446
ALL:
Moondog.

32:52.666 --> 32:55.408
[whooping]

33:02.763 --> 33:05.592
DAN: I'’m telling you guys,
I believe them.

33:05.635 --> 33:08.029
Why? Just '’cause they put
flowers in the water?

33:08.073 --> 33:10.075
No. Because they didn'’t
know I was a cop,

33:10.118 --> 33:11.380
and their motive'’s
all but vanished.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.165
I think someone'’s
trying to set them up.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.123
I mean, they don'’t
even go up to Carbon.

33:15.167 --> 33:16.646
It'’s too much
of a hassle.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.822
Sloth-- truly one of the world'’s
most deplorable sins.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.215
If you want something,

33:20.259 --> 33:22.609
you have to be willing
to go the extra mile.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.045
[imitates trumpet fanfare]

33:24.089 --> 33:25.916
What do you think?

33:25.960 --> 33:28.310
I'’m particularly proud
of the new filing system,

33:28.354 --> 33:30.573
complete with a
"Sexy Victims" pile,

33:30.617 --> 33:32.140
"Obvious Killers" pile.

33:32.184 --> 33:34.708
Oh, and "Boring Crimes" pile,
to be ignored, of course.

33:34.751 --> 33:36.492
Cannot even.
Cannot even.

33:36.536 --> 33:38.973
Should have gone with
the French toast.

33:41.280 --> 33:45.501
As if it wasn'’t bad enough
you betrayed me,

33:45.545 --> 33:48.330
nearly costing me my job,
almost getting Dan killed...

33:48.374 --> 33:50.593
I mean, did you really think
I was dumb enough

33:50.637 --> 33:53.422
to help you just because
you tried to clean up my desk

33:53.466 --> 33:55.337
and actually made it worse?

33:55.381 --> 33:57.426
I mean, what even is that?

33:57.470 --> 33:58.253
It'’s me.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.995
Are you that self-absorbed

34:01.039 --> 34:04.346
that you don'’t realize
how your actions hurt people?

34:04.390 --> 34:05.521
Hurt me?

34:05.565 --> 34:07.132
Detective.And I can only assume

34:07.175 --> 34:09.177
that you asked Pierce
for help, too,

34:09.221 --> 34:11.049
which is nuts, by the way.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.529
But I want to make
one thing clear:

34:13.573 --> 34:16.184
you can just stop
with this selfless charade,

34:16.228 --> 34:18.273
because I am never
going to help you

34:18.317 --> 34:19.970
with this investigation
of yours.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.711
Oh, I don'’t need
your help anymore.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.670
Then why are you still here?

34:25.454 --> 34:28.153
Because this case
matters to you.

34:28.196 --> 34:30.155
Therefore, it matters to me.

34:30.198 --> 34:33.245
We'’re... we're partners,
Detective.

34:37.814 --> 34:41.775
[sighs] Next time,
you want to just start there?

34:41.818 --> 34:43.211
Next time. So we'’re...?

34:43.255 --> 34:45.648
[sighs] Okay.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.085
[sighs]

34:47.128 --> 34:48.434
"Hot Suspects"?

34:48.477 --> 34:50.436
An entire folder for graffiti?

34:50.479 --> 34:52.916
This is gonna take me forever
to re-sort, you know.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.483
No, wait, w-what
are you doing?

34:54.527 --> 34:56.529
It took me ages to line
up these right angles.
[sighs]

34:56.572 --> 34:59.358
Holy crap.
That'’s it. You did it.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.142
Okay, Detective,
I get it.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.535
You don'’t like the
new filing system.

35:02.578 --> 35:04.189
But this is a bit excessive.No.

35:04.232 --> 35:05.712
The Orcas.
Remember how they said

35:05.755 --> 35:07.714
that they never go up to Carbon
because it'’s private?

35:07.757 --> 35:10.543
California has no private
beaches, which means...

35:10.586 --> 35:12.762
Someone must have put
the signs up illegally.

35:12.806 --> 35:15.504
And look here.

35:15.548 --> 35:18.072
One person was cited
dozens of times

35:18.116 --> 35:19.552
for posting at Carbon.

35:22.946 --> 35:24.644
To you, Detective.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.127
[chuckles]

35:36.395 --> 35:37.831
Hey! Hey.

35:37.874 --> 35:39.702
What do you think
you'’re doing?

35:39.746 --> 35:42.052
This is private
property.

35:42.096 --> 35:43.184
Didn'’t you see the signs?

35:43.228 --> 35:44.620
Oh, I'’m so sorry.

35:44.664 --> 35:45.752
I must have missed those.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.188
Did you happen to see them?

35:47.232 --> 35:48.189
No.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.060
No.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.454
You know, someone must have
taken them down.

35:52.498 --> 35:55.631
I don'’t know who
you two think you are,

35:55.675 --> 35:57.285
but I'’m calling the police.

35:57.329 --> 35:59.157
What, you mean
like those police?

35:59.200 --> 36:02.160
The beach signs you posted
are illegal, Justine,

36:02.203 --> 36:04.727
and you know what that
helps with? A search warrant.

36:04.771 --> 36:06.512
I wonder if
the officers will find

36:06.555 --> 36:07.861
anything of interest
in there.

36:07.904 --> 36:10.385
Yes, I wonder.
Maybe a surf leash

36:10.429 --> 36:12.561
used to strangle a
young surfer, perhaps.

36:12.605 --> 36:14.911
I don'’t know what
you'’re talking about.

36:14.955 --> 36:16.565
This is insane.

36:16.609 --> 36:18.480
Oh, come on,
tell us the truth.

36:18.524 --> 36:19.873
Did he steal from you?

36:19.916 --> 36:21.440
Hmm? Did he
owe you cash?

36:21.483 --> 36:24.182
Or perhaps it was some kind of
sexual liaison that went awry.

36:24.225 --> 36:25.313
Really, I must know.

36:25.357 --> 36:27.359
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

36:27.402 --> 36:31.232
You come to my house
and accuse me of murder?

36:31.276 --> 36:33.234
This isn'’t your home, Justine.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.367
This beach doesn'’t belong
to anyone.

36:35.410 --> 36:37.238
But that was the problem,
wasn'’t it?

36:37.282 --> 36:40.067
You are wasting your time here.

36:40.110 --> 36:43.331
Manny came here to surf,
you had enough, and you snapped.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.246
No, that'’s not true.

36:45.290 --> 36:46.856
Well, you say
that, Justine,

36:46.900 --> 36:50.164
but the police officer up there
holding a surfboard says yes.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.079
[chuckles]

36:52.122 --> 36:54.212
Sorry.
You were saying?

36:55.822 --> 36:57.258
You don'’t get it.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.739
I paid for this land.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.306
I even put up signs,
but they trampled

37:01.349 --> 37:03.438
this whole beach
like it was their own.

37:03.482 --> 37:05.266
They trashed
this whole area,

37:05.310 --> 37:07.268
and I just couldn'’t
take it anymore.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.052
I-I had to send a message.

37:09.096 --> 37:11.968
And that'’s why you framed
the Orcas for Manny'’s murder.

37:12.012 --> 37:14.406
JUSTINE: If people
were scared enough,

37:14.449 --> 37:16.973
then finally
they would stay away.

37:17.017 --> 37:18.323
Hold on.

37:18.366 --> 37:20.412
So you'’re saying
your brazen act of violence,

37:20.455 --> 37:22.588
it wasn'’t personal at all?

37:22.631 --> 37:24.416
Manny was just a means
to an end.

37:24.459 --> 37:29.421
You'’re under arrest, Justine,
for the murder of Manny Taylor.

37:36.079 --> 37:39.953
After all that, I could
really use a glass of champagne.

38:10.462 --> 38:13.421
You do? [sighs]
I do.

38:13.465 --> 38:14.944
You see, I realize

38:14.988 --> 38:17.556
that I don'’t want to hide
our relationship anymore.

Well, that'’s not
exactly what I mean.

38:27.217 --> 38:29.481

38:29.524 --> 38:32.048
Is this because
I have chlamydia?

Uh...

No. I mean...
I mean, it doesn'’t help.

38:37.619 --> 38:39.665
I mean, I can'’t believe
you slept with a prostitute.

38:39.708 --> 38:42.842
First off, I didn'’t know
she was a prostitute.

38:42.885 --> 38:45.323
Secondly, you had sex
with my brother,

False positive on the chlamydia.

we fought for nothing.

Well, it'’s not
for nothing, Amenadiel.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.134

we don'’t have... chlamydia.

we should be together.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.484
which you shouldn'’t,
but-but even if you do,

40:43.528 --> 40:47.183
it doesn'’t give you the right to
yell at me the way that you did.

40:47.227 --> 40:49.534
I-It was rude

40:49.577 --> 40:52.711
and unprofessional, and-and
I think you owe me an apology.

40:52.754 --> 40:54.277
You'’re right.

40:54.321 --> 40:56.976
I was in a bad place,
and I took it out on you,

40:57.019 --> 40:59.021
and there'’s no excuse for that.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.109
I'’m sorry.

41:00.153 --> 41:03.896
You were in
a bad place? Really?

41:05.375 --> 41:07.552
Is there anything I can do?
D-Do you need a hug?

41:07.595 --> 41:09.554
[chuckles softly]

41:09.597 --> 41:10.946
Sure. Why not?

41:16.256 --> 41:18.693
You'’re gonna miss me.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.972
Where do you think you'’re going?

41:39.235 --> 41:40.889
I didn'’t figure you
for the sentimental type.

41:40.933 --> 41:43.718
Oh, believe me, I'’m not.

41:43.762 --> 41:45.720
I'’m here because
I finally figured out

41:45.764 --> 41:48.680
why my father returned my wings.

41:48.723 --> 41:51.117
And as it turns out,

41:51.160 --> 41:54.642
it had nothing to do
with me at all.

41:54.686 --> 41:56.078
It was about you.

41:56.122 --> 41:57.732
How many times
do I have to tell you

41:57.776 --> 41:59.299
I had nothing to do
with your wings?

41:59.342 --> 42:02.215
I know, but my father did.

42:02.258 --> 42:03.825
He wanted to stop

42:03.869 --> 42:07.307
you defying Him,
and He used me to do it.

42:07.350 --> 42:09.701
You said yourself

42:09.744 --> 42:11.137
you needed me out of the way.

42:11.180 --> 42:13.618
And since my wings ruined
your kidnapping plan,

42:13.661 --> 42:18.013
it seems I was
a means to an end.

42:18.057 --> 42:19.580
So what?

42:19.624 --> 42:22.975
It means my dad screwed us both.

42:23.018 --> 42:26.195
But perhaps there'’s a way
for us to screw him back.

42:26.239 --> 42:27.501
How?

42:27.545 --> 42:30.199
By killing you, of course.

42:30.243 --> 42:32.811
I thought we went
over this already.

42:32.854 --> 42:35.465
You can'’t die, I know.

42:35.509 --> 42:36.684
But I promise you,

42:36.728 --> 42:38.904
if you stay,

42:38.947 --> 42:41.646
I will find a way to end
your infinite misery,

42:41.689 --> 42:43.865
if it'’s the last thing I do.

42:45.214 --> 42:47.129
What makes you think
you can do that?

42:47.173 --> 42:49.828
Well, you may have
crossed paths with God,

42:49.871 --> 42:51.612
but you'’ve certainly
never made a deal

42:51.656 --> 42:54.441
with the Devil before,
now, have you?
