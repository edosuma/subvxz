with the prior brain damage.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.306
So beaten about six months ago
and murdered last week.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.604
[ Exhales ]
That is some bad luck.

10:52.778 --> 10:54.564
[Angela ]
Hey, I am almost done here.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.191
ltjust needs to render.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.987
That’s not why I’m here.

10:58.075 --> 11:02.944
l— I seem to be
emotional again.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.199
[Chuckles]
Oh.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.451
This might not be
strictly hormonal.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.452
Booth is upset with me...

11:12.548 --> 11:15.540
because I’m not ready for us
to move in together.

11:15.634 --> 11:18.501
Oh. Good for Booth.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.677
I’ve always been
on my own, Angela.

11:20.764 --> 11:24.302
Yeah, but you’re never gonna
be on your own again, ever.

11:25.853 --> 11:29.846
Those little kicks you feel—
that’s just the beginning.

11:31.108 --> 11:33.565
Look at this.
[ Device Beeping ]

11:34.570 --> 11:38.404
[ Squealing ]
[ Babbling ]

11:42.411 --> 11:44.276
[ Hodgins Exhales ]
Oh, r/pe.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.578
Oh. Momm y,
it"s your turn.

11:46.665 --> 11:48.155
I’ve changed
the last 200.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.332
[ High Voice]
Yes, we want Momm y
2‘0 change us.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.371
Oh.
There ’s Momm y.
Yeah.

11:52.462 --> 11:56.876
Oh! it’s a good thing
you are so cute.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.299
Look at you.
What a sweet little boy.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.962
You and Booth,
you made that baby together.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.094
So it’s gonna expect
the both of you be there.

12:08.312 --> 12:10.268
I’m with Booth
on this one.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.271
Are you mad at me?

12:18.322 --> 12:22.065
I’m actually feeling
very affectionate
toward you.

12:22.159 --> 12:25.276
But, of course,
that could just
be the hormones.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.827
[ Chuckles ]
I hope not.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.656
[ Beeping ]

12:33.503 --> 12:35.585
[Angela ]
Okay, we have a match.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.333
Claire Serrano.

12:37.424 --> 12:41.167
There were two Missing Persons
reports filed on her
in the last six months.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.506
Hmm.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.213
Two?
Yeah, the first one
six months ago.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.173
The other last week,
the night she disappeared.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.804
Both filed by her husband?

12:49.895 --> 12:52.386
Bones says she was pretty
battered up six months ago.

12:52.481 --> 12:54.597
Maybe that’s why
she disappeared, right?

12:55.567 --> 12:58.024
Mr. Serrano.
Yes.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.147
Special Agent Booth.
This here is Dr. Sweets.

13:00.238 --> 13:03.822
Hi. Uh, this is
about Claire, right?
Did you find her?

13:04.826 --> 13:06.407
Yeah. Have a seat.
Thank God.

13:06.495 --> 13:09.202
I’ve been praying all week.
We all have.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.952
Right. I’m afraid
it’s not good news.

13:13.043 --> 13:16.035
Uh, she was found buried
in Hamilton State Park.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.252
- What do you mean?
- We believe she was murdered.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.213
But I—

13:26.264 --> 13:28.220
| just got her back.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.550
[Clears Throat]

13:33.230 --> 13:36.393
When you say you’ve all
been praying for her,
who else do you mean?

13:36.483 --> 13:39.225
Oh, um— [ Clears Throat]
my congregation.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.982
I’m the pastor of
the First Church of Christ
at Logan’s Circle.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.280
Thank you.
[Clears Throat]

13:48.495 --> 13:51.828
So this is the second time
she went missing, Mr. Serrano.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.497
Yes. Yes, the first time
was in February.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.542
She... just left one day
and disappeared.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.915
No one knew what happened.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.339
Then about six weeks ago,

14:02.426 --> 14:05.714
she turned up
in our neighborhood.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.841
But she didn’t know
why she was there.
She didn’t know who she was.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.797
Th-That’s retrograde amnesia.

14:10.892 --> 14:14.134
Yes, the doctor said she’d
suffered some head trauma...

14:14.229 --> 14:16.720
and just wandered away.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.056
Claire couldn’t
remember anything,

14:19.151 --> 14:21.062
not even what happened
when she was missing.

14:21.153 --> 14:25.396
The doctor said
she must’ve started
a new life someplace else.

14:25.490 --> 14:29.074
Wait a second.
You mean to tell me that she
can’t remember that either?

14:29.161 --> 14:30.822
No. It happens, Agent Booth.

14:30.912 --> 14:34.780
Her amnesia caused her to
establish a new identity.
It’s called a fugue state.

14:34.875 --> 14:38.083
It’s a survival technique
that can disappear
as quickly as it appears.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.411
But Claire came back to me.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.996
And she was starting
to remember.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.886
It was gonna be like it was.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.926
That was the Lord’s work.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.973
And somehow,

14:53.060 --> 14:54.800
l have to believe...

14:54.895 --> 14:57.557
that this was
the Lord’s work too.

15:05.655 --> 15:10.240
Could, uh, Claire’s injuries
have been from a beating?
Possibly.

15:10.327 --> 15:13.819
But there’s too much remodeling
to be certain what caused them.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.620
Do you think
that she was beaten?

15:15.707 --> 15:17.413
No, I don’t want to.
Her husband is a pastor.

15:17.501 --> 15:19.492
Violence would be a logical
extension of his belief.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.669
The Bible features
a vengeful god...

15:22.756 --> 15:25.543
who capriciously slaughters
the creatures he creates.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.124
Sweets would
characterize him
as a sociopath.

15:27.219 --> 15:30.256
No way.
God is not a sociopath.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.510
Well, let’sjust say
I don’t want him
babysitting for our child.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.511
Maybe you should
slow down a little bit
on the food?

15:35.602 --> 15:39.390
I need to increase
my caloric intake by
at least 300 calories.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.392
Can I have
some of your pie?

15:41.483 --> 15:43.565
Um, well, you already
are eating it. Just—

15:43.652 --> 15:46.234
You know, I’ve been thinking
about our living arrangement.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.186
You’re right.
We should move in together.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.779
Really?
Yes.

15:49.866 --> 15:53.484
Angela agrees that
it’s best for the baby
if we share a place.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.159
This is great.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.203
So you can move into
my apartment permanently.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.452
No. No. No.

16:00.544 --> 16:03.160
That is your place.
We need our place.

16:03.255 --> 16:06.088
But in Iroquois society,
the men always moved in
with the women.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.708
l-l did a very
well-respected paper
on the Iroquois.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.465
Women controlled society,
owned all the property.

16:12.597 --> 16:15.839
But we’re not the Iroquois.
But the baby
is in me, Booth.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.845
I’m more financially
secure than you.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.642
Objectively,
I’m more rational.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.186
This should be my decision.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.353
[Clears Throat]
Yeah.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.944
You know what? We’re family.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.568
Even you should know
what that means, Bones.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.525
You’re angry.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.120
Yeah. I’m angry.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.408
So, Claire Serrano was being
treated by Dr. David Yazrick,

16:43.503 --> 16:45.994
a neuropsychologist specializing
in memory problems...

16:46.089 --> 16:49.331
from amnesia, P.T.S.D.,
drug addiction.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.916
He’s waiting
to talk to us now.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.722
- Oh, boy.
- Let’s go talk to the doctor.

16:57.809 --> 17:02.348
I’ll look at the remains
again, see what—

17:02.439 --> 17:04.976
if I can find what
caused those fractures.

17:09.321 --> 17:10.982
[ Exhales ]

17:12.449 --> 17:15.941
So, I was sifting
through the soil
at the bottom of the grave,

17:16.036 --> 17:18.368
and I found fibers
coated in linseed oil.

17:18.455 --> 17:20.036
You said her clothes
had absorbed the oil.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.330
Her clothes are made
of polyethylene
terephthalate.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.415
Can’t you just say
“polyester”?
I did.

17:24.502 --> 17:29.166
Anyway, these fibers
are upland cotton
of a very high tenacity.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.086
They’re found
in this area here.

17:32.177 --> 17:34.884
So, what kind of cloth would be
made out of a fiber like that?

17:34.971 --> 17:37.428
I don’t know yet.
But whatever that cloth
turns out to be,

17:37.515 --> 17:40.928
it was removed
from the grave
before she was buried.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.135
So something was dug up
before she was buried.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.442
So, a lot of Yazrick’s methods
are unorthodox.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.190
But he’s had great success
with guided imagery...

17:53.281 --> 17:55.237
and exercises
to improve short-term memory.

17:55.325 --> 17:58.783
That guy Yazrick, wasn’t
he the guy who got bounced
from Vegas for counting cards?

17:58.870 --> 18:01.828
Yes. Yeah.
He said it was research
for his techniques though.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.701
A lot of people think that
it was, uh, just publicity...

18:03.833 --> 18:05.824
because his work
is so controversial.
I heard about him.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.784
I heard about him
while I was gambling.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.292
- Agent Booth.
- No.

18:15.387 --> 18:16.923
No, what? You don’t even know
what I was gonna say.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.387
No. Are you kidding me?
You’re kidding me right now.
No.

18:19.474 --> 18:22.011
Your voice, it just
gets all... sensitive.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.683
I-It— It’s irritating.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.933
Okay.
Something is clearly going on
between you and Dr. Brennan.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.684
We have a murder to solve.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.947
So, I read your paper on
explicit memory retrieval...

18:38.034 --> 18:40.411
and its ability
to alter current
destructive behavior.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.573
It was fascinating.
Oh, thanks.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.121
I’m actually
using it myself
to stop smoking.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.665
Of course, next,
I’m gonna have to find a way
to give up chewing gum.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.830
Well,
it’s a good trade-off.
That’s great.

18:49.921 --> 18:52.754
Listen, Sweets said that
Claire thought that she was
someone else for a while.

18:52.841 --> 18:56.333
Yeah, but something—
some faint memory—
drew her back to DC.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.214
But even after returning to DC,

18:58.305 --> 19:00.512
you said that Claire was still
suffering from amnesia.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.805
When I started treating her,
she had no distinct memories
of her past.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.883
Ooh. That must’ve
made it tense.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.887
You know, between her
and her husband.
Well, it was difficult for them.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.642
Butdunng
her last session,

19:09.733 --> 19:12.440
Claire told me that she
was remembering moments
from her wedding.

19:12.527 --> 19:15.360
And— She was so happy,
she was in tears.

19:15.447 --> 19:19.190
Was Claire afraid of anyone?
Did she think that someone
was gonna hurt her?

19:20.118 --> 19:21.654
No.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.615
What is it?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.576
We have these group
sessions once a week,

19:27.667 --> 19:30.283
so the patients know that
there are other people
with similar problems.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.539
There’s a patient
who suffers from aphasia.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.962
He was in a small-plane crash
that killed his wife.

19:35.050 --> 19:39.009
And he had become very,
very attached to Claire.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.719
But he has no history
of violence.
Attached how?

19:41.806 --> 19:45.048
Well, after a trauma like that,
some patients transfer their
feelings to someone else.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.681
It’s a sort of, uh,
survival mechanism,
emotionally.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.058
Sounds like a stalker to me.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.190
Don’t you want
Mr. Bray to help you?

20:02.285 --> 20:04.697
He’s in the other room.
I can call him.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.278
No. It’s okay.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.706
l-l’d just like
some time alone.

20:09.793 --> 20:12.500
Hmm. You okay?

20:12.587 --> 20:16.796
Sometimes
I get more fatigued
than I’m used to.

20:16.883 --> 20:20.250
Did you have any luck
identifying the weapon that
was inserted into her brain?

20:20.387 --> 20:25.131
No. But the diagnosis of amnesia
and fugue states certainly
explains the bruising I saw.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.261
Booth and Sweets
are talking
to a doctor now...

20:27.352 --> 20:29.968
to discover the extent
of her condition.

20:30.063 --> 20:33.100
I can’t imagine
having my entire life
erased like that.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.182
It’s like she kept dying.

20:35.276 --> 20:38.063
Perhaps
it was good thing.

20:38.154 --> 20:41.863
She had the opportunity
to start fresh,

20:41.950 --> 20:43.815
create a better life.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.369
Are you sure you’re okay?

20:49.833 --> 20:52.495
Yes. Just making
an observation.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.416
Because if I can—

20:54.504 --> 20:57.496
Look at the spider-web fractures
on the frontal bone,

20:57.590 --> 21:00.332
the discoloration along
the seam of the fracture.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.839
Isn’t that common
when the bone
knits together?

21:02.929 --> 21:05.921
Yes. But that section
is not from remodeling.

21:06.015 --> 21:10.634
She had recent head trauma that
reopened the original fracture.

21:10.728 --> 21:14.346
The discoloration is from
soil that entered the wound.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.977
So it happened
when she was killed?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.444
There’s no evidence
of fresh remodeling,
so,yes.

21:18.528 --> 21:23.067
The particulates in the crevice
might be able to help us
determine the murder weapon.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.331
The violin guy,
he’s the stalker?

21:33.418 --> 21:35.283
[Yazrick]
He was with the symphony
before the accident.

21:35.378 --> 21:38.666
The aphasia prevents him
from being able to speak
unless he plays his violin.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.792
It makes you want
to wear a helmet
all the time, huh?

21:40.884 --> 21:44.672
The syntactic processing
for language and music share
a set of neural resources.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.970
Music can form a bridge
which allows him to talk.
[ Booth ] Oh.

21:48.057 --> 21:51.800
Trevor, this is Agent Booth
and Dr. Sweets from the FBI.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.729
They’d like to talk to you
about Claire.

21:59.277 --> 22:02.690
Trevor, you have to talk
to them about Claire.

22:07.785 --> 22:10.162
JJ‘ [ Melody ]

22:10.246 --> 22:13.113
She belonged with me.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.248
We both knew it.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.751
Claire was afraid

to lose another person

Well, if he needed her
and felt that she was
moving away,

22:52.789 --> 22:55.451

he would do anything
to prevent that?

came from a heavy canvas used

to waterproof the canvas.

Yeah, actually,
I was correct
about the Iroquois.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.261
Of course you were.
But you know what? I also did
some research on the Internet.

25:19.352 --> 25:23.095
And I found about 20 tribes

have to move in with me.

Your point is that we aren’t

isn’t relevant.

What? So there’s no evidence
to tie Trevor Quan

26:22.540 --> 26:25.373
Nothing. But I do remember
Quan saying that Claire
was afraid of her husband.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.997
Oh, well, that could be
a projection because Quan
wanted her for himself.

because Bones...

And if the only way for that
to occur is by finding
another dwelling,

-There’s no notes in here

It’s common for a patient

found much to help.

We recovered all
the paint splatters within
a 30-foot radius of the grave,

from the rain.
