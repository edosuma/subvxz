01:18.144 --> 01:19.144
Who is it?

01:19.145 --> 01:20.145
It's me, Ma.

01:20.146 --> 01:22.147
Who?

01:22.148 --> 01:23.149
Corinne.

01:25.151 --> 01:28.654
How do I know it's really you?

01:28.655 --> 01:30.656
Ma, you can hear it's me.

01:30.657 --> 01:35.160
No, you might be Chester,
disguising your voice.

01:35.161 --> 01:36.161
Ma, I swear.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.663
I'm not Daddy.
I'm me.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.665
Are you alone?

01:39.666 --> 01:40.666
Yes, I'm alone.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.167
Please open the door.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.670
I'm holding a tray.

01:44.671 --> 01:45.671
How long are you

01:45.672 --> 01:48.674
going to stay
locked in your room?

01:48.675 --> 01:51.677
Until I know
he is not in the house.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.178
Why don't you just talk to him?

01:53.179 --> 01:55.180
I have nothing to say to him.

01:55.181 --> 01:56.181
Well, maybe he does.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.683
I know,

01:57.684 --> 02:00.185
and I've heard it all before.

02:00.186 --> 02:02.187
I love eating on trays,
don't you?

02:02.188 --> 02:04.690
I love eating.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.191
Ma, just talk to him.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.193
The only trouble is

02:08.193 --> 02:09.695
that no matter
how careful you are,

02:09.696 --> 02:11.697
there's always crumbs
in the bed,

02:11.698 --> 02:14.700
even if you're only having soup.

02:14.701 --> 02:17.202
Won't you feel better
resolving this

02:17.203 --> 02:18.203
one way or the other?

02:18.204 --> 02:19.705
Uh-oh, look at that.

02:19.706 --> 02:22.207
Mm-mm, crumbs already.

02:22.208 --> 02:27.713
Well, I'll just brush them over
on Chester's side.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.214
You see,

02:29.215 --> 02:32.718
there are some advantages
to sleeping alone.

02:32.719 --> 02:35.721
Of course, that's the only one
I can think of.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.223
Ma, you should see him.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.224
He sits in the living room,

02:39.225 --> 02:41.226
and every time someone walks by,

02:41.227 --> 02:43.228
he grabs their arm and weeps.

02:43.229 --> 02:44.730
It's impossible

02:44.731 --> 02:46.231
to get anything
done around here.

02:46.232 --> 02:49.234
Maybe if you just talk to him,
he'll go away.

02:49.235 --> 02:50.736
Oh, I can't, Corinne.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.237
Not now.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.739
Maybe soon.

02:53.740 --> 02:54.741
Five or 10 years.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.243
All right, let me know

02:58.244 --> 02:59.244
if you want anything else, okay?

02:59.245 --> 03:00.245
All right, darling.

03:00.246 --> 03:01.246
Thank you.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.748
You know, this is the first time

03:02.749 --> 03:04.249
I've stayed in my room like this

03:04.250 --> 03:06.251
since I had the measles.

03:06.252 --> 03:07.252
Good night, darling.

03:07.253 --> 03:08.253
Good night, Ma.

03:08.254 --> 03:09.254
Thank you.

03:09.255 --> 03:10.255
You're welcome.

03:10.256 --> 03:12.258
Bye-bye.

03:18.765 --> 03:19.765
Chester,

03:19.766 --> 03:22.267
you get out of here.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.769
Jess, please, just listen.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.772
Oh! There goes my spleen.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.274
Well, you're lucky
that's all that it is.

03:29.275 --> 03:30.275
Jess, please listen.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.276
I'm sick.

03:31.277 --> 03:32.277
I've got a disease.

03:32.278 --> 03:36.282
Well, with the company you keep,
I don't wonder.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.786
No, Jess, not that.

03:40.787 --> 03:41.787
Don't you understand?

03:41.788 --> 03:42.788
I can't help it.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.289
What I do is a sickness.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.791
Oh, really?

03:45.792 --> 03:46.792
Is that what you call it,

03:46.793 --> 03:48.293
a "sickness"?

03:48.294 --> 03:51.296
And the cure is bed, is it?

03:51.297 --> 03:53.298
I'll get help, Jess,

03:53.299 --> 03:54.800
if you'll just give me
another chance.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.301
I'll get help, I swear it.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.803
If I were diabetic,
you wouldn't throw me out.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.304
If you were a diabetic,

03:59.305 --> 04:01.807
you'd stay away
from the cookies.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.811
Jess, I want help.

04:05.812 --> 04:06.812
I swear it.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.313
I hate what I do as much as you.

04:08.314 --> 04:09.314
Oh, I know.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.818
It's a real drag, isn't it?

04:12.819 --> 04:16.822
All that dressing
and undressing.

04:16.822 --> 04:19.324
You won't believe me, will you?

04:19.325 --> 04:21.827
If I were a fat man
who couldn't stop eating,

04:21.827 --> 04:23.328
you wouldn't throw me out.

04:23.329 --> 04:26.832
If I couldn't stop drinking,
you'd let me stay.

04:26.833 --> 04:27.833
Well, this is no different.

04:27.834 --> 04:30.836
I'm sick, Jess.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.338
I'm a sick man, and I'm in need.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.842
Oh, Chester, don't cry.

04:36.843 --> 04:39.845
I'm a sick man, Jess.

04:39.846 --> 04:45.350
I'm sick, and I'm hurting,
and I'm scared.

04:45.351 --> 04:48.353
Okay, Chester, okay.

04:48.354 --> 04:49.855
Look, we'll talk.

04:49.856 --> 04:50.856
You'll get help...

04:50.857 --> 04:52.357
Thanks, Jess.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.359
But, in the meantime,

04:54.360 --> 04:55.360
you'll stay in the guest room.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.862
Guest room?

04:56.863 --> 04:58.864
Yes, well, look at it
this way, Chester.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.365
You have a disease,

05:00.366 --> 05:02.868
and I don't want you too near me

05:02.869 --> 05:04.369
until you're cured.

05:16.883 --> 05:19.885
Well.

05:19.886 --> 05:20.886
So you'll keep in touch?

05:20.887 --> 05:22.387
Yes, I will, Miss Page.

05:22.388 --> 05:23.388
Thanks for coming by.

05:23.389 --> 05:24.890
Because if you don't hire me,

05:24.891 --> 05:25.891
I got a job offer

05:25.892 --> 05:27.392
from a couple of chinks
down the block

05:27.393 --> 05:29.394
with two little brats...

05:29.395 --> 05:30.395
so let me know.

05:30.396 --> 05:31.897
You'll be the first one I call.

05:31.898 --> 05:33.398
Nice seeing you, lady.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.900
Fine.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.404
You believe that?

05:39.405 --> 05:42.908
Apply for a nanny,
and Rommel comes over.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.409
It's been like that all day.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.410
She wasn't so bad.

05:45.411 --> 05:46.411
Are you kidding?

05:46.412 --> 05:48.413
Of all of them,
she was the most charming.

05:48.414 --> 05:50.415
Jodie, some of them
were very, very nice.

05:50.416 --> 05:51.917
You're just being picky.

05:51.918 --> 05:52.918
I can't help it, Ma.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.920
I'm looking for someone
very special,

05:54.921 --> 05:57.422
very loving, very unique.

05:57.423 --> 05:58.924
Like who?

05:58.925 --> 05:59.925
Like you,

05:59.926 --> 06:00.926
only I can't find her.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.928
I'm sitting right here.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.429
Oh, come on, Ma,
I'm being serious.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.931
And I'm not?

06:05.932 --> 06:07.432
Mom, you can't run
down here every day.

06:07.433 --> 06:08.433
It's an hour's drive.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.936
True... but you could move home.

06:10.937 --> 06:11.937
Ma.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.438
Why not?

06:13.439 --> 06:14.940
I'd love it.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.942
Burt would love it.

06:16.943 --> 06:19.445
Even Bob has said
he's looking forward to...

06:22.448 --> 06:25.450
Burt and I would really love it.

06:25.451 --> 06:28.453
Ma, it took me 26 years
to move out.

06:28.454 --> 06:30.455
Besides, I don't want
to tie you down.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.456
Tie me down to what?

06:31.457 --> 06:33.959
What do I have to do all day?
Rope cattle, what?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.460
Ma, you're forgetting

06:35.461 --> 06:37.462
how much time
a baby demands of you.

06:37.463 --> 06:38.964
But there's me and Burt

06:38.965 --> 06:40.465
and Mrs. Burns
down the street.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.467
Oh, she'd adore
sitting with Wendy

06:42.468 --> 06:43.969
a few days a week.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.470
Mrs. Burns. You mean that
sweet little old lady

06:45.471 --> 06:46.972
who used to babysit for me?

06:46.973 --> 06:47.973
Mm-hmm.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.475
Ma, she was 90 back then.

06:50.476 --> 06:51.977
She's 62.

06:51.978 --> 06:54.980
In 1930, she was 62.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.481
Come on, Mare, let's go.

06:56.482 --> 06:57.482
I fixed it.

06:57.483 --> 06:58.483
Fixed what?

06:58.484 --> 06:59.985
The thing that needed fixing.

06:59.986 --> 07:00.986
What thing?

07:00.987 --> 07:01.987
Doesn't matter.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.488
You've got to get
a new one anyway.

07:03.489 --> 07:04.990
Jodie, those things
don't last forever.

07:04.991 --> 07:05.991
What thing?

07:05.992 --> 07:06.992
"What thing?" again.

07:06.993 --> 07:07.993
Please, Mary, let's go, huh?

07:07.994 --> 07:09.494
Bla-la-la-la.
Grandpa.

07:09.495 --> 07:11.497
Come on, Mare, let's go.

07:13.499 --> 07:16.001
Burt, talk to Jodie.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.502
Convince him I'm right.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.504
Jodie, please, she's right, huh?

07:19.505 --> 07:20.505
Your mother is right, huh?

07:20.506 --> 07:22.007
Listen to her on this, huh?

07:22.008 --> 07:23.008
She knows
what she's talking about.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.510
Just trust her
on this one, okay?

07:27.013 --> 07:29.514
What am I talking
about here, please?

07:29.515 --> 07:31.516
Mom wants me to move back home.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.018
So, come home.

07:33.019 --> 07:34.019
Jodie, come on.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.020
There's plenty of room.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.521
Hey, you could go back to work,

07:36.522 --> 07:37.522
and let's face it,

07:37.523 --> 07:38.523
if you were living with us,

07:38.524 --> 07:39.524
you wouldn't get those crackpots

07:39.525 --> 07:41.026
from the Welfare
Department, right?

07:41.027 --> 07:42.027
Well, yeah.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.528
All right. So?

07:43.529 --> 07:46.031
I don't know.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.532
Come on, Jode, come home.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.034
Come on.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.035
We could do things
together again,

07:50.036 --> 07:52.537
like hunting and fishing
in the old days.

07:52.538 --> 07:55.040
We never did that.

07:55.041 --> 07:58.543
Now we can.

07:58.544 --> 08:01.046
Just think it over, okay, honey?

08:01.047 --> 08:02.047
I will, Ma.
I promise.

08:02.048 --> 08:03.548
I admit it does make some sense.

08:03.549 --> 08:04.549
Absolutely, it makes sense.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.550
Come on, Jodie.
Think about it,

08:05.551 --> 08:06.551
roll it over in your head,

08:06.552 --> 08:08.053
do whatever you want to do.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.054
Bla-la-la-la.
Grandpa.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.056
Come on.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.057
Okay.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.058
Goodbye, honey.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.059
Bye.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.561
Oh, please don't feel pressured
by us in any way.

08:16.562 --> 08:17.562
I don't, Ma, really.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.564
Does that mean you're
gonna move home?

08:19.565 --> 08:20.565
Ma!

08:20.566 --> 08:21.566
Mare.

08:21.567 --> 08:22.567
Okay, okay.

08:22.568 --> 08:23.568
Just remember,

08:23.569 --> 08:24.569
if you change your mind...

08:24.570 --> 08:25.570
I'll call.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.072
Should I write down the number?

08:27.073 --> 08:28.573
I think I'll remember it.

08:28.574 --> 08:29.574
Okay.

08:29.575 --> 08:30.575
Bye.

08:30.576 --> 08:31.576
Bye, Wendy.

08:31.577 --> 08:32.577
Talk to you later.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.080
If you should call,
we should be home in an hour.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.581
Ma!

08:36.582 --> 08:37.582
Bye.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.087
Wait an hour and a half.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.587
Traffic...

08:43.589 --> 08:45.090
Bye.
Bye.

08:47.093 --> 08:48.093
Lock this door.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.595
Yeah.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.111
Hey, uh, Mare?

09:06.112 --> 09:08.113
What, Burt?

09:08.114 --> 09:10.615
Can I ask you a little question?

09:10.616 --> 09:11.617
Mm-hmm.

09:13.619 --> 09:16.621
How was I?

09:16.622 --> 09:19.124
Oh, Burt.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.126
You were wonderful.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.627
I told you that.

09:22.628 --> 09:24.629
You're so silly.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.131
You were wonderful.

09:29.135 --> 09:33.138
Do you say that
to all the Burts...

09:33.139 --> 09:34.139
Burt.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.640
It's nothing, it's just...

09:35.641 --> 09:37.142
I was just wondering,
that's all.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.643
I told you.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.645
It couldn't have been
any better, really.

09:40.646 --> 09:43.648
It was the best ever.

09:43.649 --> 09:44.649
Yeah?

09:44.650 --> 09:46.652
Yeah.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.656
The best ever for me,
or for any Burt?

09:51.657 --> 09:52.657
Burt...

09:52.658 --> 09:54.659
I'm, just, Mare, I gotta know.

09:54.660 --> 09:55.660
Can't you just forget it?

09:55.661 --> 09:56.661
Forget it?

09:56.662 --> 09:57.662
Mare, please.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.164
There was another man
in my house...

09:59.165 --> 10:00.165
in my bed,

10:00.166 --> 10:02.668
in my... pajamas.

10:07.072 --> 10:08.673
There was another man
in the house, Mare.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.175
Come on, how do I forget that?

10:10.176 --> 10:11.676
It wasn't as if

10:11.677 --> 10:13.178
I fell in love with another man.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.679
It wasn't another man.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.680
It was you.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.182
To you, it was me.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.183
To me, it wasn't me.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.184
To me, it was

10:19.185 --> 10:21.187
that hot little
silver guy that's...

10:23.689 --> 10:24.689
So how was he?

10:24.690 --> 10:25.690
I don't believe this.

10:25.691 --> 10:26.691
I gotta know, Mare.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.193
Come on, just, how was he?

10:28.194 --> 10:29.194
I refuse to discuss this.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.695
Great, huh?

10:30.696 --> 10:32.197
Oh, yeah, he was really great?

10:32.198 --> 10:33.698
What was so great?

10:33.699 --> 10:36.201
I mean, what did he do
that was so great?

10:36.202 --> 10:37.702
I mean, how many ways are there

10:37.703 --> 10:40.705
that someone can be much better
than someone else?

10:40.706 --> 10:41.707
It's not like dancing.

10:44.210 --> 10:47.212
I mean, there's not
a whole lot of steps.

10:47.213 --> 10:48.213
So what did he do?

10:48.214 --> 10:51.217
I mean, some fancy space stuff
that we don't have yet?

10:53.719 --> 10:54.719
Was that it?

10:54.720 --> 10:56.721
I'm not discussing this, Burt.

10:56.722 --> 10:57.722
It's ridiculous.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.224
Because if it was some kind

10:59.225 --> 11:01.226
of science fiction-
type sex, Mary,

11:01.227 --> 11:02.227
I cannot compete.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.728
Those guys live forever.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.730
I mean, I'm sure there are
a lot of things

11:05.731 --> 11:07.232
that they could do forever.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.235
So was that it?

11:10.236 --> 11:12.238
I mean, could he,
you know... forever?

11:17.243 --> 11:18.243
You know something?

11:18.244 --> 11:19.744
You're selfish.

11:19.745 --> 11:22.747
You are an incredibly
selfish man, Burt Campbell.

11:22.748 --> 11:23.748
Don't change the subject here,
Mary.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.250
I know what you're trying to do.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.252
You're just trying
to throw me off the track.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.253
No, I'm not.

11:28.254 --> 11:29.254
I went through hell, Burt.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.255
Hell.

11:30.256 --> 11:31.256
The man I thought was you

11:31.257 --> 11:32.757
was an animal, a maniac.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.259
I had to keep moving
all the time.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.261
If I sat down or, God forbid,
lay down,

11:36.262 --> 11:37.263
it was all over.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.265
I felt like a fly.

11:40.266 --> 11:42.268
I had to keep going or get it.

11:46.272 --> 11:47.272
And not only that,

11:47.273 --> 11:49.274
he was always going
after other women.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.277
Family, friends,
strangers, anyone.

11:52.278 --> 11:53.778
So while you're all upset

11:53.779 --> 11:55.780
over how terrible it was
for you, Burt,

11:55.781 --> 11:57.282
it was equally terrible for me.

11:57.283 --> 12:01.286
It was not only your ordeal.

12:01.287 --> 12:03.788
It's incredible.

12:03.789 --> 12:04.789
You and I had it terrible.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.792
He had a ball.

12:10.796 --> 12:13.298
I'm sorry, Mare.

12:13.299 --> 12:14.299
Don't you see

12:14.300 --> 12:15.800
that it could never be
as good with him,

12:15.801 --> 12:17.302
because the most important thing

12:17.303 --> 12:18.304
was missing?

12:24.810 --> 12:26.311
It was?

12:26.312 --> 12:28.314
Yes.

12:30.316 --> 12:31.817
Then how'd he do it?

12:33.319 --> 12:35.320
No, Burt, not that.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.322
Oh, I...

12:37.323 --> 12:39.325
Too bad.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.830
Love was missing, Burt...

12:45.831 --> 12:46.831
and when that's missing,

12:46.832 --> 12:48.333
all the expertise in the world

12:48.334 --> 12:51.336
isn't gonna make it any good.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.838
That's why
it couldn't come close

12:53.839 --> 12:56.341
to being what it is with you.

13:00.846 --> 13:02.847
Oh, Mare.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.349
Burt, I love you, I love you.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.351
I love you too, Mare.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.357
Tell me one little thing he did
you really liked.

13:12.358 --> 13:13.358
Burt!

13:13.359 --> 13:14.859
Come on, Mare,
just one little thing.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.361
Just... Not a big thing,
a little thing.

13:16.362 --> 13:17.862
I'll never ask you again.

13:17.863 --> 13:21.867
Well, he would...
bite my earlobe.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.371
He would bite your earlobe?

13:26.372 --> 13:27.372
Yes.

13:27.373 --> 13:30.375
That's what you like,
earlobe biting?

13:30.376 --> 13:31.876
Burt...

13:31.877 --> 13:32.877
Is that what this
commotion is about?

13:32.878 --> 13:33.878
Some little guy comes by,

13:33.879 --> 13:34.879
chews on your ear,

13:34.880 --> 13:36.381
everybody gets crazy?

13:36.382 --> 13:38.383
Burt, you said,
"one little thing."

13:38.384 --> 13:39.384
That's one little thing.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.888
What was it, like this...?

13:43.889 --> 13:44.889
Something...

13:44.890 --> 13:45.890
Burt...

13:45.891 --> 13:47.392
What did he do with the earring,

13:47.393 --> 13:48.394
swallow it?

13:57.403 --> 13:59.404
Hey, tell me,

13:59.405 --> 14:00.905
how's it feel to be 18?

14:00.906 --> 14:01.906
Pretty much the same.

14:01.907 --> 14:02.907
So far,

14:02.908 --> 14:04.409
only one minor artery
has hardened.

14:07.413 --> 14:10.415
Corinne, have you seen Eunice?

14:10.416 --> 14:13.918
Behind you.

14:13.919 --> 14:16.421
Just checking.

14:16.422 --> 14:17.922
What was that?

14:17.923 --> 14:18.923
Oh, Corinne,

14:18.924 --> 14:20.425
he is just driving me crazy.

14:20.426 --> 14:21.426
I roll over in bed at night,

14:21.427 --> 14:23.428
and he asks me where I'm going.

14:23.429 --> 14:24.429
Well, I can't blame him, Eunice.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.931
I mean, he practically
caught you red-handed

14:26.932 --> 14:28.933
in a hotel with another guy.

14:28.934 --> 14:32.937
Eric and I were discussing
insurance premiums.

14:32.938 --> 14:33.938
Please, Eunice.

14:33.939 --> 14:34.939
Insurance?

14:34.940 --> 14:36.941
Really, we had an accident.

14:36.942 --> 14:40.445
He rear-ended me.

14:40.446 --> 14:44.450
I don't think your insurance
covers that.

14:47.453 --> 14:48.453
You see that?

14:48.454 --> 14:49.454
Do you see how he watches me?

14:49.455 --> 14:51.457
He never takes his eyes off me.

14:56.962 --> 14:59.464
He doesn't trust you, Eunice.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.465
Well, what kind of relationship

15:00.466 --> 15:01.966
are we gonna have without trust?

15:01.967 --> 15:03.968
Relationships
are built on trust.

15:03.969 --> 15:04.969
Without trust,

15:04.970 --> 15:05.970
you just don't have anything.

15:05.971 --> 15:06.971
I'll be right back.

15:06.972 --> 15:07.972
Where are you going?

15:07.973 --> 15:09.474
To call Eric.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.316
I've gotta tell him
we have to be more careful.

15:13.979 --> 15:14.979
Jess?

15:14.980 --> 15:16.481
Hi.

15:16.482 --> 15:17.482
Hello.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.983
You look very nice this evening.

15:18.984 --> 15:19.984
Thank you.

15:19.985 --> 15:20.985
Oh, Jess.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.488
The hands!

15:23.489 --> 15:24.489
No hands,

15:24.490 --> 15:25.990
and no talking

15:25.991 --> 15:27.992
unless it is
absolutely necessary.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.994
Now, this is Billy's birthday,

15:29.995 --> 15:31.496
and we don't want anyone to know

15:31.497 --> 15:32.497
that there's trouble between us.

15:32.498 --> 15:33.998
Anything you say, Jess.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.500
And when someone comes close,

15:35.501 --> 15:37.502
then we put up
some kind of a front...

15:38.504 --> 15:41.005
Oh, Chester, you say
the funniest things.

15:41.006 --> 15:42.006
Oh, Jess...

15:42.007 --> 15:43.508
The hands!

15:48.514 --> 15:50.515
So, have you thought it over?

15:50.516 --> 15:52.016
About moving back home?

15:52.017 --> 15:53.017
Yeah.
And?

15:53.018 --> 15:54.519
I don't know.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.521
Well, we don't want
to pressure you in any way.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.022
No, there's no pressure.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.524
Absolutely no pressure at all,
you understand that?

15:59.525 --> 16:00.525
None.

16:00.526 --> 16:03.027
Come home.
This is killing your mother.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.030
Come home?

16:08.033 --> 16:09.033
We'll try it.

16:10.035 --> 16:12.036
There you go, Jodie.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.037
Oh, Jessie,

16:13.038 --> 16:15.039
I have the most wonderful news.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.040
Jodie's moving back home.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.543
Oh, Mary, I'm so happy for you.

16:18.544 --> 16:22.047
Could Chester
have his apartment?

16:27.553 --> 16:29.053
How are they?

16:29.054 --> 16:30.054
How are who?

16:30.055 --> 16:31.055
The hors d'oeuvres.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.557
Oh, well, I haven't
tried them yet.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.058
I'm really worried, big guy.

16:34.059 --> 16:36.060
I never made
hors d'oeuvres before.

16:36.061 --> 16:38.061
There wasn't much call for
them at cellblock eight.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.064
I'm sure.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.566
You know, rolling
the little bitty dough,

16:41.567 --> 16:43.067
and rolling
the little bitty meat,

16:43.068 --> 16:45.069
that isn't easy when
you've got stubby hands.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.571
You see my hands?

16:46.572 --> 16:47.572
They're stubby.
I see.

16:47.573 --> 16:48.573
I've got stubby hands.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.074
I see them, Dutch, I see them.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.576
That's from hauling garbage

16:51.577 --> 16:52.577
and greasing trucks,

16:52.578 --> 16:54.078
and fitting sewer pipes.

16:54.079 --> 16:56.081
Here, here, try one.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.084
I think not.

17:00.085 --> 17:02.086
Aw, come on, big guy,
just a little taste.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.087
Maybe in a little while.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.088
Take a bite.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.590
No. Dutch...

17:08.594 --> 17:09.594
How are they?

17:09.595 --> 17:11.095
Mm, very good.

17:11.096 --> 17:13.598
Aw, you're just saying that.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.602
What's the matter, darling?

17:17.603 --> 17:19.103
You seem nervous.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.606
Oh, Ma, everyone is gonna meet
Leslie tonight.

17:21.607 --> 17:22.607
It is nerve-wracking.

17:22.608 --> 17:23.608
Last night, I dreamt she eloped

17:23.608 --> 17:25.609
with the entire senior class.

17:25.611 --> 17:29.113
Darling, you love Leslie?

17:29.114 --> 17:32.117
Well, we all love you,
so we'll all love Leslie.

17:34.620 --> 17:35.620
What's that for?

17:35.621 --> 17:37.121
Just for being
such a terrific mother.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.122
Aw, thank you.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.644
That's her! She's here!
Everyone relax.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.634
Oh...

17:56.141 --> 17:57.141
Happy birthday, Billy.

17:57.142 --> 17:58.142
Thanks.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.644
Hey, 18 big ones, huh?

17:59.645 --> 18:02.146
Well, he still looks
like jailbait to me.

18:02.147 --> 18:03.648
Bob, come on.

18:03.649 --> 18:06.150
So where's your teacher, huh?

18:06.151 --> 18:07.652
Is she polishing her apples?

18:08.654 --> 18:09.654
Bob...

18:14.159 --> 18:15.159
Good evening.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.160
Oh, Billy,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.662
Oh, are you late?

18:17.663 --> 18:18.663
I didn't notice.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.164
Everyone, this is Leslie Walker.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.167
Leslie, this is everyone.

18:30.175 --> 18:31.676
Hi, Teach.

18:31.677 --> 18:34.178
You wanna go upstairs
and conjugate some verbs?

18:34.179 --> 18:35.179
Bob.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.682
Hi, I'm Burt.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.183
P.S. 71,
class of '46.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.685
Hi. Leslie Walker.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.186
What's the capital of Arizona?

18:42.187 --> 18:43.187
Phoenix.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.188
Whoo-hoo!

18:44.189 --> 18:45.189
You're right.

18:45.190 --> 18:48.192
It's nice to see you.

18:48.193 --> 18:49.694
That's his teacher?

18:49.695 --> 18:50.695
Yeah, not bad, huh?

18:50.696 --> 18:51.696
Not bad?

18:51.697 --> 18:54.699
All my teachers
looked like Rocky Marciano.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.701
I might've gone to a class
once in a while

18:56.702 --> 18:58.703
if I had teachers
that looked like her.

18:58.704 --> 18:59.704
I might've gone to a class

18:59.705 --> 19:02.206
if mine looked
like Rocky Marciano.

19:02.207 --> 19:03.708
Hey.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.714
You know something here?

19:09.715 --> 19:11.716
It's very ironic.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.217
What?

19:13.218 --> 19:14.719
Well, they made it
illegal for teachers

19:14.720 --> 19:16.721
to hit the students, and now...

19:16.722 --> 19:17.722
Wait a minute. Hey!

19:17.723 --> 19:19.725
Now the students
hit on the teachers.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.728
It's ironic.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.733
She's adorable.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.735
Didn't I tell you?

19:30.736 --> 19:32.236
Do you think they're...

19:32.237 --> 19:33.237
you know...

19:33.238 --> 19:35.239
No, absolutely not.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.742
Please, he's a child.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.745
He still plays with his boats.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.748
Billy, I have
a little present for you.

19:43.749 --> 19:45.249
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.751
I quit my job.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.252
That's my present?

19:48.253 --> 19:49.253
Well, I had applied for a job

19:49.254 --> 19:50.755
at the university last semester,

19:50.756 --> 19:52.757
and it came through.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.258
So that means...

19:54.259 --> 19:56.260
Exactly.

19:56.261 --> 19:59.263
Mm-hmm.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.766
What does it mean?

20:01.767 --> 20:04.769
Well, it means
that I'm no longer your teacher.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.270
Mrs. Fairbanks
is your teacher now.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.271
See?

20:07.272 --> 20:10.274
You mean I have to take out
Mrs. Fairbanks?

20:10.275 --> 20:12.777
You're 18.

20:12.778 --> 20:13.778
You're a man.

20:13.779 --> 20:14.779
I'm no longer bound

20:14.780 --> 20:16.781
by any legal or moral code.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.784
I can safely give you
your present,

20:19.785 --> 20:21.285
and tonight,

20:21.286 --> 20:25.290
I'm gonna light up every candle
on your cake.

20:34.299 --> 20:37.302
I better start
thinking of a wish.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.807
Private...

20:42.808 --> 20:45.810
is she bothering you?

20:45.811 --> 20:46.811
Who, Gramps?

20:46.812 --> 20:49.313
These camp followers
can be a pain.

20:49.314 --> 20:51.315
Gramps,
this is Mrs. Walker.

20:51.316 --> 20:52.316
Hello.

20:52.317 --> 20:54.318
Mrs. Biff Walker?

20:54.319 --> 20:57.822
Blackjack Biff's wife?

20:57.823 --> 21:01.325
Oh, your husband is one hell
of a pilot, Mrs. Walker.

21:01.326 --> 21:02.827
Gramps...

21:02.828 --> 21:05.329
You've got to be careful, son.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.331
A non-com
with an officer's wife

21:07.332 --> 21:09.333
can get you 20 years
in the brig.

21:09.334 --> 21:12.336
Also, don't bite her shoulder.

21:12.337 --> 21:13.838
She hates that.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.343
Colorful family you have.

21:19.344 --> 21:21.846
Look, I know they seem
a little, uh...

21:21.847 --> 21:24.849
And the Major seems a lot...

21:24.850 --> 21:25.850
but don't let it
bother you, okay?

21:25.851 --> 21:27.351
It's not hereditary.

21:27.352 --> 21:28.352
I mean, deep down,

21:28.353 --> 21:30.354
we're all strong-willed,
clear-minded people.

21:30.355 --> 21:31.856
Oh, I wasn't worried.

21:31.857 --> 21:32.857
Good.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.862
Eunice!

21:37.863 --> 21:39.363
So you have to be careful, huh?

21:39.364 --> 21:40.865
You just stay away from me!

21:40.866 --> 21:41.866
You asked for it, Eunice.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.367
Wait a minute, what is going...

21:44.690 --> 21:46.370
Hey, guys, come on,
get a hold of yourself!

21:46.371 --> 21:47.371
Hey, hey, come on.

21:47.372 --> 21:50.875
Chopped liver
never solved anything.

21:50.876 --> 21:51.876
You're right, Burt, thanks.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.878
I should just kill her.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.379
Hey, hey!

21:55.380 --> 21:56.881
Oh, Jess, take me back.

21:56.882 --> 21:57.882
Take me back, please.

21:57.883 --> 21:58.883
I'll be good.

21:58.884 --> 21:59.884
Don't send me away.

21:59.885 --> 22:00.885
Chester...

22:00.886 --> 22:03.387
Oh, Jessie, Jessie, Jessie.

22:03.388 --> 22:05.890
Why don't we go?

22:05.891 --> 22:06.891
Now?

22:06.892 --> 22:09.895
Yeah, it's time
to open my present.

22:14.900 --> 22:15.900
What is with you?

22:27.913 --> 22:29.914
ANNOUNCER:
<i>What will happen with Eunice and Dutch?</i>

22:29.915 --> 22:31.415
<i>Will she keep fooling around?</i>

22:31.416 --> 22:33.417
<i>Will he keep throwing food?</i>

22:33.418 --> 22:35.419
<i>What is Leslie's</i>
<i>birthday present to Billy?</i>

22:35.420 --> 22:37.421
<i>Is it safe to bet</i>
<i>it won't come wrapped?</i>

22:37.422 --> 22:39.423
<i>What will happen</i>
<i>to Jessica and Chester</i>

22:39.424 --> 22:40.925
<i>now that she won't talk to him?</i>

22:40.926 --> 22:42.426
<i>Will they write notes?</i>

22:42.427 --> 22:43.928
<i>Will Burt continue to be jealous</i>

22:43.929 --> 22:44.929
<i>of Alien Burt's lovemaking?</i>

22:44.930 --> 22:46.430
<i>Will Mary miss it?</i>

22:46.431 --> 22:48.432
<i>These questions and many others</i>

22:48.433 --> 22:52.437
<i>will be answered</i>
<i>on the next episode of</i> Soap.
