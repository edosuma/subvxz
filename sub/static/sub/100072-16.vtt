to remind me
that I don't make enough

00:39.450 --> 00:42.040
to afford satellite radio.

Sir, could you please
roll down your window?

01:41.300 --> 01:43.820
I can't. I spilled honey on it
and it won't move.

01:43.890 --> 01:45.640
Please just
step out of the vehicle.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.860
Sir, you were swerving
back there.

01:50.930 --> 01:53.240
Plus, you're drowning in sweat.
Have you been drinking?

01:53.310 --> 01:55.900
No. I don't start drinking
till... until the drive home.

01:55.980 --> 01:57.660
Why are you slurring your words?

01:57.670 --> 01:59.670
Sorry, I had Cap'n Crunch
for breakfast.

01:59.740 --> 02:02.120
The roof of my mouth
is in shreds.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.120
I find that story relatable.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.960
You're free to go.

02:06.030 --> 02:08.500
Man, I can't believe
that cop thought I was lying.

02:08.509 --> 02:11.130
The only time I lie is
when I play poker.

02:20.710 --> 02:22.350

02:22.360 --> 02:24.020
All in.

02:29.610 --> 02:31.370
Got to take this.
It's my wife.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.780
Are you here?

02:36.860 --> 02:39.110
Okay, you two
just hang out in the store

02:39.190 --> 02:40.600
while I return this keyboard.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.990
I'm going to watch
the older boys play <i> Fortnite,</i>

02:43.070 --> 02:46.160
because I'm not old enough
to play <i> Fortnite</i> myself.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.210
Hi. I'd like to return
this keyboard.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.710
Was there
something wrong with it?

02:49.720 --> 02:51.880
Well, it said it was designed
for writers,

02:51.890 --> 02:54.560
but when I sat down to work, it
just wasn't flowing through me.

02:54.630 --> 02:56.380
- Do you have a receipt?
- Uh, no.

02:56.420 --> 02:58.060
Uh, no.
Can't you just look it up?

02:58.140 --> 03:00.550
Do you have the credit card
you used to pay for it?

03:00.560 --> 03:03.680
I actually paid using
store credit for another return.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.890
Do you have the original
packaging for the item?

03:05.900 --> 03:07.520
No. No, that's...

03:07.590 --> 03:09.570
that's probably
with the receipt.

03:11.410 --> 03:13.820
Manager who's
dishearteningly younger than me

03:13.890 --> 03:15.400
to the service counter, please.

03:15.410 --> 03:17.690
This better not be
another overring.

03:17.770 --> 03:20.290
Corpowate's gonna have my ass.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.370
Well, we can probably throw out
this sunflower butter

03:28.450 --> 03:31.050
now that Stewie's classmate
with the peanut allergy died.

03:33.260 --> 03:35.920
Oh, there you are, Peter.
Listen, I need you to...

03:35.930 --> 03:37.430
Why are you so sweaty?

03:37.470 --> 03:39.010
The AC in my car broke.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.340
<i>Not</i> from the honey.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.390
And fat-guy sweat
is like a battleship.

03:42.460 --> 03:44.890
Once it gets going,
you can't just turn it around.

03:44.970 --> 03:46.260
So until the weather cools off,

03:46.280 --> 03:48.350
you're gonna be dealing
with a slippery walrus.

03:48.430 --> 03:51.020
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I see a potential rival

03:51.100 --> 03:52.910
to my beach supremacy.

04:04.650 --> 04:05.790
Now?

04:05.870 --> 04:08.200
No, let them
tire themselves out.

04:09.470 --> 04:10.960
Dad, what are we doing here?

04:10.970 --> 04:13.040
Now that I sweat all the time,

04:13.120 --> 04:16.350
it's just natural that I be
a very sweaty bomb defuser.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.470
Steady. You can do this.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.890
All you gotta do is remember the
song you learned in bomb school.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.810
¶<i> Green is good</i>
<i>and green is good</i> ¶

04:27.820 --> 04:30.150
¶<i> And red is good</i>

04:30.230 --> 04:31.690
¶<i> And clip whatever you want.</i> ¶

04:33.660 --> 04:35.490
Now, who can tell me
what he did wrong?

04:35.570 --> 04:37.230
He made up a song
about cutting wires?

04:37.310 --> 04:39.330
He made up
a song about cutting wires.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.870
Don't do that, guys.

04:45.150 --> 04:47.240
<i>We now return to</i> Indiana Jones

04:47.320 --> 04:49.170

04:51.870 --> 04:53.000
It's <i> Dr.</i> Jones.

04:53.010 --> 04:55.170
Oh, a doctor.

04:55.180 --> 04:57.510

my frumpy daughter.

04:58.740 --> 05:00.850
Wow. What are you
all dressed up for?

05:00.880 --> 05:03.350
Well, thanks
to my car's AC breaking,

05:03.390 --> 05:05.930
I've been asked to be
an overly sweaty Southern lawyer

05:06.000 --> 05:08.430
during a landmark
civil rights case.

05:08.510 --> 05:10.270
Mr. Griffin, you may proceed.

05:10.340 --> 05:12.270

05:49.880 --> 05:51.560
and one pair of extra-small.

05:51.570 --> 05:54.680
Uh, we'll be fine.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.020
Well, I just got off the phone
with the electronics store.

05:57.100 --> 06:00.570
Your stupid fight caused
$3,000 worth of damage.

06:00.650 --> 06:03.150
Well, I'm not very good at math.
Y-You lost me.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.320
- A thousand dollars.
- Wow!

06:05.400 --> 06:07.920
- Another thousand dollars.
- Oh, my goodness!

06:07.990 --> 06:09.570
A third thousand dollars.

06:09.590 --> 06:11.200
Now you lost me again.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.200
I don't think Chris
can count to three.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.590
How are we gonna pay 'em back?

06:14.670 --> 06:16.040
Whoa, what do you mean, "we"?

06:16.120 --> 06:18.420
Yeah, do you expect
all nine of us to chip in?

06:18.430 --> 06:20.380
Come on,
we got to think of some way

06:20.450 --> 06:21.710

06:36.800 --> 06:38.230
That's it!
We'll set up a Kickstarter

06:38.310 --> 06:39.950
for the three grand we need.

06:40.020 --> 06:42.620
But, Brian, people don't just
donate money on Kickstarter.

06:42.690 --> 06:45.440
It has to go
toward some sort of project.

06:45.450 --> 06:47.610
Okay, then we'll say
we're making a movie.

06:47.620 --> 06:49.460
And who will we get to direct?

06:49.530 --> 06:51.580
We'll raise the money we need,
pay back the store,

06:51.650 --> 06:53.950
and then e-mail the backers,
saying we ran into trouble

06:53.960 --> 06:55.540
and couldn't finish the project.

06:55.610 --> 06:58.010
Great idea, Brian.
Much better than that version

06:58.040 --> 07:02.210

07:18.680 --> 07:20.060
Oh, sorry, that's from me.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.990
I-I got a little
perspiration problem.

07:22.070 --> 07:23.820

our meeting, Oscar?

07:23.830 --> 07:25.150
It's... Aah!

07:25.160 --> 07:28.150
Sorry. What time
is our meeting, Aah-scar?

07:28.160 --> 07:30.820
Damn it, Griffin, you've become
a liability in this office.

07:30.860 --> 07:32.950
- Why? 'Cause I'm drunk
and have a gun?
- No.

07:33.030 --> 07:34.500
- 'Cause of the cocaine?
- No.

07:34.580 --> 07:35.740
'Cause I use office petty cash

07:35.820 --> 07:37.450
to have sex
with high-end escorts?

07:37.530 --> 07:41.250
No. But your perspiration
has become a serious problem.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.840
I'm afraid you're going
to have to work from home

07:43.850 --> 07:46.510
- until you get it under control.
- All right, if you insist.

07:46.590 --> 07:48.130
Hey, Candy,
sorry I couldn't finish

07:48.210 --> 07:50.180
'cause I'm so freakin' gacked
on ski powder.

07:50.260 --> 07:52.140
I thought the gun
would get me there.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.600
Anyway, here's the office cash.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.360
Careful of the wet floor.
You're pregnant.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.200
So, Dad, are you excited
for your first day

08:05.280 --> 08:07.910
- of working from home?
- Yes, but I'm <i> very</i> late.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.200
Busy dad morning goodbyes.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.840
Forgot my phone.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.900
Are you here?

08:44.910 --> 08:47.520
So, Mom, you're okay
with Dad working in the house

08:47.600 --> 08:48.980
- all the time?
- Oh, yeah,

08:49.060 --> 08:50.910
it's nice having a coworker.

08:50.990 --> 08:53.530
'Cause being a housewife
is a full-time job.

08:53.610 --> 08:56.080
For some pretty tough bosses!

09:00.760 --> 09:03.260
Hi. So, is this your break time?

09:03.330 --> 09:04.870
- No, sir.
- Oh, okay.

09:04.950 --> 09:07.380
I was wondering
if my watch was off, maybe.

09:07.450 --> 09:09.090
- It's not.
- You see, Mom,

09:09.100 --> 09:11.600
we try to stay focused
on the task at hand

09:11.680 --> 09:14.600
here at Griffin, Griffin,
Griffin, Griffin and Griffin.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.390
Good morning.

09:16.460 --> 09:18.350
Griffin, Griffin,
Griffin and Griffin.

09:18.420 --> 09:21.680
Huh. I thought our letterhead
had <i> five</i> Griffins on it, Meg.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.230
But you were right
to leave one of them off,

09:24.300 --> 09:26.770
because you're *** fired.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.120
<i>Uh, hello?</i>

09:34.200 --> 09:35.740
Hey, Lois.
I'm at the small bodega

09:35.820 --> 09:37.240
in the living room lobby

09:37.320 --> 09:39.450
trying to pick out
a new baby card for Janine.

09:39.460 --> 09:40.700
Wai... Who's Janine?

09:40.780 --> 09:42.800
Yeah, right?
Anyway, should I get one

09:42.870 --> 09:44.790
with a baby
with SpaghettiOs on his head,

09:44.800 --> 09:46.920
like, "This is
what it's gonna be like,"

09:46.990 --> 09:48.960
or one with a stork
with an injured back?

09:48.970 --> 09:50.800
Peter, I don't care.

09:50.810 --> 09:54.800
Well, time to live out my dream
of becoming a bodega cat.

09:54.810 --> 09:57.640
I'm between the breads.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.480
Again, I want to say I'm so glad
all of our schedules lined up

10:04.490 --> 10:06.440
so we can work together.
And, as a reminder,

10:06.510 --> 10:08.160
we've got New York on the line.

10:08.230 --> 10:10.480
New York, are you there?

10:10.490 --> 10:13.110
Stewie, is there anyone specific
on the line in New York?

10:13.190 --> 10:14.440
Brian, you're just showing
your ignorance.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.780
The phrase is,
"New York on the line."

10:16.860 --> 10:19.120
<i>- Hey, buddy,</i>
<i>- move that piece of junk!</i>

10:19.190 --> 10:20.490
<i>Go Mets!</i>

10:20.500 --> 10:22.670
And that's
the best city we have.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.160
All right, so,
we've heard from New York.

10:24.170 --> 10:25.290
- What have you guys got?
- This...

10:25.370 --> 10:26.730
this can't be the meeting.

10:26.730 --> 10:29.000
New York, I'm gonna put you
on hold for a second.

10:29.010 --> 10:30.790
Brian, you're embarrassing us
in front of New York.

10:30.870 --> 10:32.420
Now get it together.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.170
All right, let's show them
the pitch video we put together.

10:37.020 --> 10:38.350
My name's Stewie,

10:38.430 --> 10:40.470
and this camera saved my life.

10:40.550 --> 10:42.930
I was born on the wrong side
of the tracks.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.970
My father made holes in belts,

10:45.050 --> 10:47.770
and my mother was
the Italian guy on a pizza box.

10:47.850 --> 10:50.440
The old man wanted me to go
into the family business.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.200
Hey! I don't hear any holes
being holed!

10:53.280 --> 10:54.780
I want to make movies, Pa!

10:54.850 --> 10:56.370
Don't make me beat you

10:56.450 --> 10:59.370
with the instrument with which
I make holes in belts!

10:59.450 --> 11:01.210
It's called an awl, Pa!

11:01.280 --> 11:03.380
You son of a bitch!

11:04.400 --> 11:06.200
Ma! Do something!

11:06.220 --> 11:08.720
Frank, no!

11:08.790 --> 11:10.380
<i>Six months later,</i>

11:10.460 --> 11:13.290
<i>my old man died when they</i>
<i>canceled</i> The Tony Danza Show.

11:13.370 --> 11:15.300
<i>The one that was on
during the day.</i>

11:15.370 --> 11:18.060
<i>Anyway, all that
is why I want to make a movie</i>

11:18.140 --> 11:20.980
<i>about a dog
who joins a hockey team.</i>

11:24.550 --> 11:26.570
Morning, handsome.

11:26.640 --> 11:27.980
Mwah.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.740
Now, Lois, you have been accused
of an unwanted touching.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.080
- When?
- Just now.

11:35.150 --> 11:36.240
Just before the flip.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.740
Uh, this is ridiculous.

11:37.750 --> 11:38.990
Lois, please.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.660
Now, the way this works is

11:40.730 --> 11:43.870
we simply gather information and
I make up my mind an hour ago.

11:43.940 --> 11:45.700
Peter, please tell us
what happened.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.420
I'm sitting there at my desk,

11:47.500 --> 11:49.160
trying to watch porn on sites

11:49.240 --> 11:50.750
you guys
haven't figured out yet,

11:50.760 --> 11:51.920
and...

11:51.930 --> 11:53.590
she comes in and kisses me.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.600
Now, Barbara, the reason
you are here at Super HR

12:01.680 --> 12:04.680
is there's been an accusation
of unwanted touching

12:04.760 --> 12:08.020
and an overly sexualized
work environment.

12:08.090 --> 12:10.780
That's it. Peter,
no more working from home.

12:10.850 --> 12:12.780
I want you to go back
to the office.

12:12.860 --> 12:15.950
Peter, how can the company
make this right?

12:16.030 --> 12:18.740
Bring back Lay's WOW chips
with Olestra.

12:18.810 --> 12:22.200
Mr. Griffin, those chips
were recalled in the '90s

12:22.270 --> 12:24.700
for causing explosive diarrhea.

12:24.780 --> 12:26.200
You heard me.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.790
Mmm.

12:27.870 --> 12:29.410
So good.

12:30.470 --> 12:31.460
Uh-oh.

12:34.210 --> 12:36.850
All right, boys,
get me up to speed.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.800
Brian! Chris!

12:44.810 --> 12:46.100
Stewie, what's the matter?

12:46.170 --> 12:47.480
Our Kickstarter...

12:47.560 --> 12:49.270
What?
Did we not hit our goal?

12:49.340 --> 12:52.770
I also want to ask a question
without looking at the screen.

12:52.850 --> 12:55.860
Oh, oh, we hit it all right.

12:59.350 --> 13:00.400
Whoa.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.150
We actually have
to make this thing.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.660
Gentlemen, it's time

13:03.670 --> 13:05.620
to start inappropriately
touching actresses

13:05.690 --> 13:07.160
on the casting couch.

13:07.170 --> 13:10.500
Okay, I have been made aware
of the allegations.

13:10.580 --> 13:13.880
Is there anything you can say
on your behalf?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.830
I'm trans?

13:16.850 --> 13:18.850
You just won HR.

13:26.340 --> 13:27.930
All right.
Dishes washed,

13:28.010 --> 13:29.140
kids off to school,

13:29.220 --> 13:31.020
taking my boobs out of my bra.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.350
Alexa, play Mom Spa channel.

13:38.220 --> 13:39.690
All right, you're gonna have
to catch me up.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.360
I just stepped off a bird
from Omaha,

13:41.370 --> 13:42.860
and I have a very tight window.

13:42.870 --> 13:44.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.610
I don't have the bandwidth
for this right now.

13:45.690 --> 13:47.620
This is a lot for me to unpack,
honestly.

13:47.690 --> 13:49.280
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.830
Well, I'm gonna have
to circle back with Ken

13:50.900 --> 13:52.210
to get it past the goal line.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.500
Unless, Wendy, do you want
to run it up the flagpole?

13:54.570 --> 13:56.370
Well, at the end of the day,
it is what it is.

13:56.390 --> 13:57.830
Look, look, look.
Listen, listen.

13:57.910 --> 13:59.630
Look, listen, look, look,
listen, listen.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.390
Not to put
too fine a point on it,

14:01.460 --> 14:03.460
but when push comes to shove,
look, listen, look.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.220
Okay, I'm gonna put a pin
in this.

14:05.230 --> 14:07.680
I got to go crowd the gate so
people think I'm in first class,

14:07.750 --> 14:09.430
even though
I'm in boarding group seven.

14:09.510 --> 14:11.400
Peter, for God's sake,

14:11.470 --> 14:13.520
can I not just have 15 minutes
of peace and quiet

14:13.590 --> 14:14.640
in my own kitchen?

14:14.720 --> 14:16.400
All right,
I'll stay out of your way.

14:16.480 --> 14:20.030
I will simply do my work
and not say a word.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.520
Peter,
we are gonna have to fi...

14:57.600 --> 14:59.100
<i>Attention, please,</i>

14:59.170 --> 15:02.070
<i>we are gonna begin pre-boarding
Flight 238 to Scottsdale,</i>

15:02.140 --> 15:04.610
<i>beginning with our first-class
and Prestige members.</i>

15:04.620 --> 15:06.580
Oh, that's me. I got to go.

15:09.370 --> 15:12.030
Scuse me, is there any way
I can get on the plane now,

15:12.110 --> 15:15.550
even though I'm in the seat
whose back touches the bathroom?

15:19.630 --> 15:21.960
Okay, welcome
to the first official table read

15:21.970 --> 15:24.300
for <i> The Untitled</i>
<i>Kickstarter Project.</i>

15:24.310 --> 15:26.310
Chris will be on speakerphone
from down the hall,

15:26.380 --> 15:29.140
and, as a reminder, that may
result in a five-second delay.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.310
So, now to hand it over
to our writer extraordinaire,

15:32.390 --> 15:34.600
- Mr. Brian...
<i>- Hi, everyone!</i>

15:34.670 --> 15:35.980
There's the delay.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.560
Brian Griffin, take it away.

15:37.640 --> 15:38.480
Thank you, Stewie.

15:38.490 --> 15:39.680
And before we get started,

15:39.680 --> 15:41.230
I would like
to officially thank Stewie

15:41.310 --> 15:42.650
for spearheading this project,

15:42.660 --> 15:43.990
and I'd like to thank Chris

15:44.070 --> 15:46.280
for his help scouting
all the locations.

15:46.350 --> 15:47.320
Now, scene one.

15:47.330 --> 15:48.570
We open on a suburban...

15:48.650 --> 15:49.830
<i>Aw, you're welcome, Brian!</i>

15:49.910 --> 15:51.330
<i>Happy to pitch in.</i>

15:51.410 --> 15:52.820
Yeah, speaking of scouting,

15:52.830 --> 15:54.330
you sure got good at scouting

15:54.410 --> 15:55.910
the location
of the nearest Burger King.

15:55.990 --> 15:57.000
Okay, scene one.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.500
We open on a suburban home,

15:58.510 --> 16:00.580
where a party is in full swing.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.340
There is a knock at the...

16:02.420 --> 16:04.460
<i>I do like Burger King!</i>

16:04.540 --> 16:05.670
...at the door.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.970
The teenage son answers it.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.100
<i>Well, if it isn't
my favorite uncle.</i>

16:15.170 --> 16:16.970
Why-why did we give him
the lead part?

16:17.050 --> 16:18.930
Chris, we're having
a little delay issue here,

16:19.010 --> 16:21.280
so try and come in
a little sooner, yeah?

16:25.030 --> 16:26.650
<i>Roger that.</i>

16:26.730 --> 16:29.540
Okay. The teenage son stares
at the man in the doorway,

16:29.610 --> 16:32.820
- and they exchange an intense...
<i>- Back so soon, Uncle Cornelius?</i>

16:32.900 --> 16:34.490
Okay, Chris,
that was a little too soon.

16:34.570 --> 16:35.990
Bri-- look,
what we're gonna do is, Brian...

16:36.070 --> 16:38.620
<i>Why didn't you come
to my mom's funeral?</i>

16:38.700 --> 16:40.380
No, no, Chris,
we're pausing for a second.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.120
All right? Okay, okay, Brian,
here's what we're gonna do.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.000
You're going to slap the table
halfway through your line,

16:45.050 --> 16:47.220
and, Chris, when you hear
the slap on your end,

16:47.300 --> 16:48.390
that's when you talk.

16:48.470 --> 16:49.710
Everyone got that?

16:49.720 --> 16:50.850
Yes.

16:54.420 --> 16:55.890
<i>Yes.</i>

16:55.900 --> 16:58.230
Okay. Uncle Cornelius stands
in the doorway

16:58.310 --> 17:00.310
in stunned silence...

17:00.380 --> 17:03.400
not knowing what to say but
knowing he should say something.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.069
<i>Well, do you have anything
to say for yourself?</i>

17:06.150 --> 17:08.319
- This is working.
- You're damn right I do!

17:08.390 --> 17:10.650
Uncle Cornelius
slaps the table in anger

17:10.730 --> 17:12.819
as he walks across
to pour himself a gin and...

17:12.900 --> 17:16.569
<i>I'll return your pearl-handled
revolver one bullet at a time!</i>

17:16.589 --> 17:18.740
Okay, let's just shoot it.
It all works.

17:18.750 --> 17:22.260
I just want to thank... everyone
for all their hard work today.

17:22.329 --> 17:24.339
<i>You're welcome!</i>

17:29.290 --> 17:30.710
What the hell?

17:33.250 --> 17:34.270
Oh, hi, Peter.

17:34.340 --> 17:35.840
Like what I've done
with the place?

17:35.920 --> 17:37.770
I'm not sure what you <i> have</i> done.

17:37.850 --> 17:41.440
Well, since you decided to turn
our house into an office,

17:41.520 --> 17:43.730
I decided to make it
into a public work space

17:43.800 --> 17:45.520
for everyone to enjoy.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.060
Principal Shepherd?

17:47.140 --> 17:49.360
Oh, hey, Peter. John Shepherd
of Shepherd Marketing.

17:49.430 --> 17:51.280
Eye contact, firm handshake.

17:51.290 --> 17:52.610
We can put your logo
on anything:

17:52.620 --> 17:54.570
a mug, a set of pens, a mug.

17:54.650 --> 17:56.120
I, uh-- I don't have a logo.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.680
Funny you should say that,

17:57.680 --> 18:00.030
because our art department
could whip you something up.

18:00.110 --> 18:02.910
Hmm, let's see.
Peter, Peter...

18:02.990 --> 18:04.120
Penis?

18:04.130 --> 18:06.080
Let's just fire up Windows 98.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.710
You like that, right on the mug?

18:07.790 --> 18:09.290
Uh, n-no. No, thank you.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.920
Lois, what do you think
you're doing?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.960
Uh, I don't know what
you're talking about, Peter.

18:12.970 --> 18:16.090
Just creating
a nice work environment for you.

18:16.170 --> 18:19.300
For instance, I also piped in
easy listening music

18:19.310 --> 18:20.430
throughout the house.

18:20.510 --> 18:21.890
¶<i> Doo doo doo...</i> ¶

18:21.970 --> 18:24.060
"Ode to My Family"
by the Cranberries?

18:24.140 --> 18:26.980
Lois, you know once I hear that,
I can't get it out of my head.

18:26.990 --> 18:28.940
Don't worry.
It's not the whole song.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.060
It's just the...

18:30.140 --> 18:32.070
¶<i> Doo doo doo doo</i> ¶

18:32.140 --> 18:33.280
...part on repeat.

18:33.350 --> 18:34.780
That's the catchiest part!

18:34.850 --> 18:36.110
Well, you better get to work.

18:36.190 --> 18:38.000
It's already 9:15.

18:38.070 --> 18:40.490
Come on, Peter, focus.
You can do this.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.450
¶<i> Doo doo doo doo, doo...</i> ¶

18:42.530 --> 18:45.250
And... send.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.500
All right.

18:46.510 --> 18:49.470
Let's see
what Griffin's been up to.

18:52.590 --> 18:56.170
Hmm. I've been saying that
to corporate for years.

18:56.180 --> 18:57.340
I got your mug, Peter.

18:57.350 --> 18:59.260
That'll be $59.99.

18:59.340 --> 19:00.600
I got a Square here,

19:00.670 --> 19:02.690
so we can take care
of the transaction in-house.

19:02.770 --> 19:04.360
Geez, seems kind of pricey.

19:04.430 --> 19:06.980
Well, we could bring that down
to $29.99,

19:07.050 --> 19:09.030
but you'd have
to buy 4,000 of them.

19:09.110 --> 19:12.520
Fruit Baskets Covered in
Cellophane. How may I help you?

19:12.530 --> 19:16.370
Long, juicy bananas
and melon balls.

19:16.450 --> 19:18.530
No, I know you hadn't asked me
a question.

19:18.540 --> 19:21.820
I was just thinking
about another part of my day.

19:21.900 --> 19:23.880
Okay! Fire drill!

19:23.950 --> 19:26.120
Everyone out in the hot sun
for an hour,

19:26.200 --> 19:28.910
with no information
as to when we're coming back!

19:28.990 --> 19:30.720
Damn it, Lois.
I can't take this!

19:30.790 --> 19:33.890
Huh. Maybe you'd be better off
working from your office.

19:33.960 --> 19:37.210
But I thought you'd like having
me around the house all day.

19:37.230 --> 19:38.550
I thought so, too, Peter.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.840
But maybe it was
too much of a good thing.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.970
You know I love you, but if
this marriage is gonna survive,

19:44.050 --> 19:46.680
I think you need to be gone
for most of it.

19:46.760 --> 19:47.570
I guess you're right.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.980
When you look at it,

19:49.050 --> 19:51.240
most marriages are
just a couple hours a night.

19:51.310 --> 19:54.320
I'm sorry I was getting on
your nerves, being home so much.

19:54.390 --> 19:57.190
I'll call Bert and ask him if
I can come back to the office.

19:57.270 --> 19:58.400
Thank you, Peter.

19:58.410 --> 19:59.910
I love you so much.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.320
- I love you, too.
- Mmm.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.790
Hey, I went ahead and ordered
those 4,000 penis mugs for you.

20:05.860 --> 20:06.900
I don't want those.

20:06.980 --> 20:08.580
Well, what am I supposed
to do with them?

20:08.590 --> 20:11.370
May I propose a merger?

20:11.450 --> 20:15.510
¶<i> The secret of my success</i>
<i>is I'm living.</i> ¶

20:23.610 --> 20:24.760
Wow, we did it.

20:24.770 --> 20:26.560
We actually made a movie.

20:26.630 --> 20:28.100
Yeah, I don't want
to call this a movie.

20:28.110 --> 20:29.560
We made a film.

20:29.590 --> 20:31.440
We made a film, guys.

20:31.450 --> 20:36.070
And we even had $300,000
left over to buy snacks.

20:36.140 --> 20:40.440
"M-Movie snacks are very
expensive" is, is-is the joke.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.830
Here we go.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.740
This is garbage!

20:47.820 --> 20:50.370
I'm just happy for a night out.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.250
Now, who can tell me
what they did wrong?

20:54.330 --> 20:56.420
They were no-talent jerks
who made a Kickstarter movie?

20:56.500 --> 20:59.090
They were no-talent jerks who
made a Kickstarter movie.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.020
Don't do that, guys.
