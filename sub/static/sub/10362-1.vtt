Come here!

17:56.400 --> 17:57.360
Oh!

17:57.440 --> 17:59.760
[man speaking Norwegian on TV]
But in languages,

17:59.840 --> 18:02.960
not only linguistics and research
are important.

18:03.040 --> 18:06.280
Do you think the wolf killed my sheep?

18:06.400 --> 18:08.640
No, Jonas, don't think like that.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.000
Everything will be fine.

18:11.960 --> 18:15.400
I couldn't see
any footprints of predators.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.200
Dad?

18:21.280 --> 18:23.400
Do you know anyone
who drives an electric car?

18:27.640 --> 18:30.840
Hi. Do you need any help?

18:30.920 --> 18:32.160
Uh...

18:32.240 --> 18:34.160
Come, come.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.160
[whispers] Put that away.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.840
[in English] I found her on the road
and I'm looking for the owner.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.520
[Sigrid in Norwegian]
It is an escaped sheep.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.520
- Hi, I'm Sigrid.
- [in English] Oh, hi.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.240
We never said hello on the train.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.760
Yeah, yeah.
Giovanni. Call me Johnny.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.440
[Sigrid in Norwegian]
Now you are happy, Jonas.

18:59.520 --> 19:00.880
[Sigrid laughs]

19:00.960 --> 19:03.040
You...

19:03.120 --> 19:05.200
Thanks a lot for finding her.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.880
[in English]
My pleasure. I got lucky.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.640
- That's a nice kid you got there.
- Yeah.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.720
Father around? I'd like to meet him.

19:12.800 --> 19:17.120
Uh... No, he's not living here.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.920
Oh.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.920
Well, small town. Maybe we'll run
into each other again, you know?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.360
- Yeah.
- Have a little coffee.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.400
Okay. Thank you.

19:38.840 --> 19:42.280
[in Norwegian] Hello.
Nice that so many could come.

19:42.360 --> 19:45.520
Eight people. Very good.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.880
Today we are going to have
a look at some forms.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.040
You are disturbing us.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.440
What Giovanni is doing here,

20:01.560 --> 20:04.680
is breaking the first
rule of the workplace,

20:04.800 --> 20:07.600
namely, being punctual.

20:07.680 --> 20:10.040
So, I see there are some regulars here.

20:10.160 --> 20:14.520
That's always nice. Hi, Maria.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.720
Those among you who were
at the motivation seminar

20:16.800 --> 20:22.120
held at my cabin last year
know that I am a fishing enthusiast.

20:22.200 --> 20:26.360
And what I usually say is that getting
a job is like fishing.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.720
You have to put the line out
to catch something.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.720
[laughs]

20:31.760 --> 20:35.440
It's time for you to meet
a friend of mine. Arne.

20:35.520 --> 20:39.480
Today, Arne is your employer,
and you are going to a job interview.

20:39.560 --> 20:43.000
- [Arne] Am I... Sorry.
- [Jan] Don't disturb me.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.800
Um... Any volunteers?

20:46.880 --> 20:49.960
Does anyone want to...
Giovanni?

20:50.040 --> 20:53.280
[in English] Come on,
let's give it a shot. Yes, please.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.720
Thank you.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.840
[in Norwegian] Hi, Giovanni.

21:03.920 --> 21:07.880
Why, exactly should we choose you?

21:07.960 --> 21:10.120
[in English] Do I talk to you
or talk to the dummy?

21:10.200 --> 21:11.560
[in Norwegian] Talk to Arne.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.880
Hi, Giovanni.

21:14.960 --> 21:19.240
Uh... What are your strong qualities?

21:20.720 --> 21:22.880
[in English]
My strong qualities? Uh...

21:22.960 --> 21:26.200
I'd say observation's
one of my finer qualities.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.760
Observing you,
I'd say you look a little stiff.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.440
[classmates laughing]

21:36.040 --> 21:38.280
[in Norwegian]
You can't have a little fun.

21:38.360 --> 21:41.080
Let's take a little break.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.720
Giovanni, could I have two minutes?

21:43.800 --> 21:45.320
[in English] Two minutes, please.

21:47.720 --> 21:52.760
[in Norwegian] I'm going to transfer you
over to a course called Fresh Start.

21:52.840 --> 21:54.880
[in English] What's that?

21:54.960 --> 21:57.760
It's a six-month daily course

21:57.840 --> 22:02.760
for immigrants that struggle
to adapt to Norwegian society.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.200
Six months?
You gotta be joking.

22:06.280 --> 22:10.600
[in Norwegian]   I never joke when it comes
to integration, Giovanni. You need this.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.480
[in English] Wait a minute.
Are you telling me

22:12.560 --> 22:15.280
I gotta spend half a year learning
how to be a fucking immigrant?

22:15.360 --> 22:16.880
[in Norwegian] You would perhaps
rather have me call the police.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.520
[in English]
Do you want me to call the police, then?

22:18.600 --> 22:20.200
And tell them about the bribe?

22:22.120 --> 22:24.320
- Okay. [sighs]
- Okay.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.440
Hey, mister.

22:28.520 --> 22:29.920
Mister.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.800
Do you want to come for a beer?
[in Norwegian] A Friday beer?

22:32.880 --> 22:34.360
[in English] With us?

22:34.440 --> 22:38.320
Uh... No, thanks. I gotta pass.
It's a big TV night.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.160
Sure, okay.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.640
[indistinct conversation]

22:46.880 --> 22:51.360
On second thought, one drink.
What the hell.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.200
- Sure. Okay.
- Yeah.

22:57.040 --> 23:00.840
[in Norwegian]   I get 340 kroners
a day from NAV to manage.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.720
How are you going to manage on that?

23:02.800 --> 23:06.840
[in English] I only get 340 kroners
per day from NAV.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.560
[in Norwegian] That is going to cover
your cell phone and electricity bills

23:09.640 --> 23:12.800
- and food expenses.
- You don't have any food expenses.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.840
You know you eat at home every day.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.000
[stammers]
I am talking about the principle.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.560
How can you manage
on 340 kroner a day?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.920
I am talking about the system.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.080
We haven't ordered anything.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.120
From that table.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.840
[Roar] You sit here
and drink beer every day.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.320
[Torgeir] The system is fucked.

23:35.120 --> 23:38.200
Shut up.
Let's throw some darts.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.040
I am not so good at darts.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.440
[in English]
Do you want to come play, um...

23:42.520 --> 23:44.040
[in Norwegian]
What is it called?

23:44.120 --> 23:46.160
- [in English] Dart?
- No. No, thanks.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.560
- I'll stay here and hold the table.
- Okay.

23:48.640 --> 23:51.520
[in Norwegian] Wait for me.
I'll take the first round.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.400
- [in English] Hi.
- Please.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.600
[in Norwegian]
Thank you for the champagne.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.160
[in English] Oh, my pleasure.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.600
[in Norwegian]
Are you together with friends?

24:07.680 --> 24:10.480
- You don't take...
- It's my turn now.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.160
[in English] Friends...

24:13.240 --> 24:15.360
More like business associates.

24:15.440 --> 24:19.760
Okay. So what kind of business is that?

24:19.840 --> 24:22.680
[in Norwegian]
Torgeir gets money from NAV.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.680
- It's that obvious?
- Yeah.

24:25.880 --> 24:29.320
I'm not gonna be at NAV too long.
I'm just getting some information.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.080
I'm opening a nightclub, actually.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.480
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.400
And you? What do you do?

24:35.480 --> 24:38.200
I'm a teacher, you know...
[in Norwegian] a Norwegian teacher.

24:38.280 --> 24:43.480
[in English] I used to work in Oslo,
but now I hope to get a job here.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.320
But it's not so easy in this...
[in Norwegian] county.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.760
So, we'll see.

24:48.840 --> 24:52.440
Well, there's a lot of new foreigners
in town, so maybe they'll be hiring soon.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.000
[chuckles]

24:55.080 --> 24:57.040
To teachers.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.440
[in Norwegian] Yeah. Cheers.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.520
Oh!

25:01.600 --> 25:03.320
[Torgeir laughing]

25:04.640 --> 25:07.800
[in Norwegian] Excuse me?
Two, uh... beers.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.200
[in English]
Nice place you got here.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.520
I used to be in the bar business myself.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.320
[in Norwegian] Well, if you want it,
I'll give you a good price.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.200
I've had enough of the tax man
and freezing temperatures.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.600
[in English]
I'm moving to Alicante.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.480
We should talk.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.840
A hundred and fifty.

25:26.920 --> 25:27.800
A hundred and fifty?

25:27.880 --> 25:29.360
[in Norwegian]
That's what it costs.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.600
[in English] Sorry, I have to go.
Something just happened.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.760
There's been a wolf on the farm.

25:34.840 --> 25:37.280
- I'll take you. Yeah.
- Are you sure?

25:38.320 --> 25:39.440
Uh... Keep it.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.880
Jonas...

25:48.160 --> 25:49.880
[sheep groaning]

25:50.000 --> 25:51.920
[Sigrid] Oh!

25:52.000 --> 25:55.240
- [in Norwegian]   It was the wolf.
- I know.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.440
[in English]
We're gonna get that wolf.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.800
[in Norwegian]   I promise.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.920
[Sigrid]
Come on, let's go inside.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.160
[sheep groans]

26:10.240 --> 26:13.600
You'd better turn away,
you being a city boy.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.400
[in English] It's okay.

26:23.880 --> 26:27.960
[Torgeir in Norwegian] The wolves are
too bad. What good are they?

26:28.040 --> 26:32.640
We've got trackers and shotguns
over at our place if you need them.

26:32.720 --> 26:36.800
Didn't you two shoot one of the mayor's
goats last time you went after a wolf?

26:36.880 --> 26:38.240
[both]
That was an accidental shot.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.600
- I've told you that before.
- You bloody well know it was.

26:40.680 --> 26:41.880
[Frank in English]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:41.960 --> 26:45.760
Why are we sitting, talking when we should
be out killing this fucking thing?

26:45.840 --> 26:50.280
[in Norwegian] In this country killing
a wolf is worse than killing people.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.040
[in English]
Bullshit. Are you kidding me?

26:53.120 --> 26:56.480
What are we waiting for?
I'm telling you right now--

26:56.560 --> 26:59.320
- [knocking on door]
- [Sigrid in Norwegian] Come in.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.320
Good evening.

27:04.080 --> 27:08.480
I heard about the wolf and just wanted
to make sure everything was all right.

27:13.520 --> 27:16.320
There wouldn't be anyone thinking
of doing anything rash here?

27:25.080 --> 27:27.480
I think perhaps I'll look after this
for a couple of days.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.600
[in English] Excuse me,
but aren't people allowed to defend

27:30.680 --> 27:32.760
their own homes in this country?

27:32.840 --> 27:36.920
Unlicensed killing of wild animals

27:37.000 --> 27:39.560
is strictly forbidden in Norway.

27:41.120 --> 27:43.320
[in Norwegian]
I take it we're all fully aware of that.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.640
Could I have a waffle?

27:48.720 --> 27:50.400
Of course, help yourself.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.560
Thank you, Sigrid.

27:51.640 --> 27:52.720
You're welcome.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.960
Have a nice evening.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.720
[in English]
Sorry, Lily.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.560
[dog barking]

28:40.360 --> 28:44.160
So, you guys really know how
to find this wolf or what?

28:44.240 --> 28:46.680
[in Norwegian] What do you think
you're gonna do to it?

28:46.760 --> 28:49.520
Is he gonna back up over it
in the lawn mower?

28:53.760 --> 28:55.720
[in English] You guys in or out?

28:55.800 --> 28:58.280
We're in, but...

28:58.360 --> 29:00.240
Maybe it's a bit dark now.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.800
- [in Norwegian] It's damn cold.
- [in English] Yeah, real cold.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.520
Oh, I see.

29:06.080 --> 29:08.760
What do you mean, "I see"?

29:08.840 --> 29:13.320
You talk real big, but when
it comes down to it, you're chicken.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.960
[in Norwegian]
Is he calling us "chicken"?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.200
[spits]

29:26.440 --> 29:28.200
[Frank in English]
Is this really necessary?

29:28.280 --> 29:33.520
[in Norwegian] You can't be wandering
about the woods in patent leather shoes.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.640
[in English] Just look at the snow.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.320
[Torgeir and Roar chuckling]

29:41.400 --> 29:42.960
There's something
wrong with these things!

29:45.040 --> 29:47.160
[in Norwegian] Did I see some
snowshoes in the barn?

29:48.360 --> 29:50.120
[wings flutter]

29:50.200 --> 29:51.720
[owl hooting]

30:01.920 --> 30:04.120
[beeping]

30:04.200 --> 30:06.640
[in Norwegian]   The wolf appears
to be further north.

30:06.720 --> 30:11.040
Are you sure this is a good idea?
You heard what the police chief said.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.280
The police chief?
She's home in bed by now.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.240
I'm just a bit worried
about striking out off the track

30:15.320 --> 30:18.280
with our new countryman back there.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.000
Since when did you become such a pussy?

30:20.080 --> 30:21.560
[spits]

30:21.640 --> 30:22.760
Come on.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.160
[beeping steadily]

30:43.240 --> 30:46.960
Check out the tracker.
Is he close by or what?

30:48.320 --> 30:50.120
Come on.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.120
[mutters in English] Fuck.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.480
[in Norwegian]
You are getting better at it.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.240
[in English]
Yeah... Real funny.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.640
[mutters] You fat fuck, you.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.720
[in Norwegian]
These are really fresh.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.080
Come on.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.400
[wolf howling]

31:20.720 --> 31:22.640
[Frank in English]
Could have been in the Bahamas.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.520
Or Fort Lauderdale.

31:26.600 --> 31:30.680
No. I gotta go to a place
where if your dick freezes off,

31:30.760 --> 31:33.480
you don't even notice it for three days.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.480
I'm telling ya...

31:43.560 --> 31:45.600
[whines]

31:45.680 --> 31:47.920
[device beeping steadily]

31:50.880 --> 31:53.360
[device beeping faster]

32:16.200 --> 32:18.600
[device beeping faster]

32:21.520 --> 32:23.360
[wings fluttering]

32:23.440 --> 32:26.760
- [gunshot echoes]
- [Roar screams]

32:28.240 --> 32:30.880
[Roar in Norwegian]
What the hell!

32:30.960 --> 32:33.200
[groaning]

32:33.280 --> 32:35.160
Fuck!

32:36.960 --> 32:39.160
Roar...

32:39.240 --> 32:42.560
Sorry! I didn't see you!

32:42.640 --> 32:44.600
I'm blacking out!

32:44.680 --> 32:46.760
- Wait!
- [groaning]

32:46.840 --> 32:51.200
- Sorry, fuck!
- You hit a main artery.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.800
- [gunshot in the distance]
- What's happening?

32:53.880 --> 32:57.320
Never mind that.
I'm dying here, you fucking idiot.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.880
[groans]

32:58.960 --> 33:00.680
Bandage me!

33:02.280 --> 33:04.200
Torgeir, you shot me!

33:05.520 --> 33:07.840
It just grazed you.
You'll be fine.

33:07.920 --> 33:11.200
- It really hurts.
- It just grazed you. Here.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.600
- You shot me, idiot!
- Here.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.760
- Do something!
- Here.

33:20.800 --> 33:24.680
We just have to stop
the little that comes out.

33:24.760 --> 33:27.120
[Frank in English]
Did I hear a shot?

33:27.200 --> 33:29.320
[in Norwegian]
Misfire. But it's all right.

33:29.400 --> 33:33.880
[in English] Look what I ran into while
you kids were playing cowboys and Indians.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.440
[in Norwegian] Holy shit!

33:37.520 --> 33:39.280
[in English]
How about that?

33:40.320 --> 33:42.640
[Torgeir in Norwegian] Fuck!

33:42.720 --> 33:44.120
[laughs]

34:01.280 --> 34:03.720
[in English]
One more rock should do it, huh?

34:16.320 --> 34:20.040
[whispering in Norwegian]
Shh! What was that?

34:20.120 --> 34:22.720
[whispering]
Probably just a deer or something.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.720
[man in Norwegian] Hello?
Anybody there?

34:25.800 --> 34:28.040
[Frank in English]
We gotta get out of these woods.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.600
[in Norwegian]
I can't walk home on this leg.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.840
Wait...

34:33.920 --> 34:36.080
[Torgeir in English]
I used to go fishing with NAV here.

34:36.160 --> 34:38.200
[in Norwegian]
Johansen's cabin.

34:38.280 --> 34:42.760
I think it's in that area.
We can spend the night there.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.040
[man] What are you doing?

34:47.320 --> 34:48.800
- [Roar groans]
- Shh!

34:57.320 --> 35:01.200
- [Torgeir] Where the hell is the key?
- [shuddering]

35:06.280 --> 35:07.640
Fuck.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
[gunshot echoes]

35:12.080 --> 35:14.280
[in English]
I found it.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.560
[Torgeir in Norwegian]
I know what we need now.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.160
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.440
- [in English] That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.360
[chuckles]
There's booze in that.

35:36.440 --> 35:38.000
Yes, homemade.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.960
That's some Norwegian cuisine
I could learn to love.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.520
Mmm.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.320
[in Norwegian]   I'm hungry.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.320
[in English]
You should call room service.

35:54.240 --> 35:58.240
What did you do, um...
back in the States?

35:59.400 --> 36:02.560
I had a restaurant, a little bar.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.200
[in Norwegian] You seem to know
a lot about guns and...

36:07.280 --> 36:09.400
[in English]
getting rid of evidence...

36:09.480 --> 36:13.600
[in Norwegian]   and pistols
for just a restaurant guy.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.760
[in English] You kiddin'?

36:17.200 --> 36:19.480
You ever seen the Cooking Channel?

36:19.560 --> 36:21.000
It can get pretty rough.

36:21.080 --> 36:24.560
[in Norwegian] What the hell?
What the hell?

36:29.720 --> 36:31.560
Any naked ladies?

36:31.640 --> 36:33.840
Yeah.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.200
- [Roar laughs]
- Johansen?

36:36.280 --> 36:39.440
- Yeah.
- [Roar in Norwegian] Look at him.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.040
[Torgeir]
Holy shit! Look at this.

36:44.640 --> 36:48.280
She can't be more than 15, 16 years old.

36:48.360 --> 36:51.040
I've driven her and her mom
to school several times.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.440
[Torgeir]
He works for the county.

36:53.520 --> 36:56.000
[in English]
Yeah, that's interesting.

36:56.160 --> 37:00.240
- [in Norwegian] I am getting sick.
- [Torgeir] Look at him!

37:00.320 --> 37:02.200
I am shocked!

37:02.280 --> 37:04.680
This is serious business.

37:04.760 --> 37:06.840
He works for the county.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.920
Roar...

37:39.560 --> 37:41.040
[in English] Look who's here.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Be cool, okay?

37:45.080 --> 37:46.800
Follow my lead.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.440
Oh, hello.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.800
[Laila in English] Hi.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.240
[in Norwegian]
Well, been on a long trip?

37:54.320 --> 37:58.080
[in English] Just, uh,
out enjoying your lovely scenery.

37:58.160 --> 38:03.920
[in Norwegian] We've had a report
about illegal hunting in this area.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
[in Norwegian] Wow!

38:07.120 --> 38:09.400
- [in English] Illegal hunting, yeah?
- Ah.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.560
That's crazy.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.200
Mm.

38:14.640 --> 38:19.000
[in Norwegian]
We have a witness.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.200
Supervisor Antonsen.

38:21.280 --> 38:24.160
He saw illegal hunting
in the Mesna hills yesterday.

38:26.600 --> 38:30.840
If you have something to say,
it would be wise to do it now.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.520
[in Norwegian] We were...

38:33.600 --> 38:38.240
[in English] We don't really have anything
to say because we didn't see anything.

38:48.520 --> 38:52.480
[in Norwegian] Did you see
these guys yesterday?

39:01.200 --> 39:03.160
No.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.040
- Huh?
- No?

39:05.120 --> 39:08.480
The ones I saw were younger fellas.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.600
[Laila] But you said
you saw the Lien brothers.

39:10.680 --> 39:13.920
[Antonsen]   My eyesight clearly isn't
as good as it used to be.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.240
[Lailla] Isn't it, now?

39:15.320 --> 39:19.480
The ones I saw must have been
some youths from Oslo.

39:19.560 --> 39:22.560
Youths from Oslo are the worst.

39:22.640 --> 39:26.560
[in English] So, now that we've cleared up
that little misunderstanding,

39:26.640 --> 39:29.080
why don't we all go
inside and have a drink?

39:29.160 --> 39:30.760
Mmm.

39:30.840 --> 39:34.480
[in Norwegian]
Thank you, but we'd better be off.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.120
[in English]
Always good to help the authorities.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.560
Especially when they're neighbors.
[chuckles]

40:08.440 --> 40:09.960
How ya doin'?

40:10.040 --> 40:11.800
[in Norwegian] I don't think
we have an appointment today.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.760
[in English]
I think we do.

40:13.840 --> 40:19.280
[in Norwegian] If you think you can come
charging in here with more bribes...

40:19.360 --> 40:22.640
[in English]
Yeah, well, that's my appointment.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.040
[in Norwegian] What's this?

40:44.400 --> 40:45.920
But how have you got hold of these?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.640
[in English] The real question is,
what am I gonna do with them?

40:54.360 --> 40:56.040
Is this blackmail?

40:56.120 --> 40:58.040
Definitely.

40:58.120 --> 41:01.840
Where I come from, these kind of pictures
could be a problem for a public official,

41:01.920 --> 41:05.720
but maybe that's just
[mocking] cultural differences.

41:05.800 --> 41:09.520
Could be a problem
here as well. Absolutely.

41:09.600 --> 41:10.880
Okay.

41:10.960 --> 41:14.880
How about I make the pictures disappear
and you do a little something for me.

41:14.960 --> 41:20.000
Is this about the...
[in Norwegian] New Start course?

41:20.080 --> 41:21.800
[in English]
I can get you off, it's no problem.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.080
[in English] Nah.

41:23.160 --> 41:27.080
I'm gonna take that course
and this is gonna be my teacher.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.560
[in Norwegian] She has been here
for some interviews...

41:36.640 --> 41:38.720
[in English]
She's not working here, you know.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.520
Is that gonna be a problem?

41:42.560 --> 41:44.040
No, no, no, no, no.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.280
Um...

41:45.360 --> 41:46.800
All right.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.880
So now all we gotta do is take care
of the license for my sports bar.

41:51.560 --> 41:55.280
Yeah, you know, as I said,
that's a very complicated...

41:55.360 --> 41:57.280
I understand.

41:57.360 --> 42:01.920
Wait, wait, wait, I can...
I can call a guy.

42:02.960 --> 42:06.720
[in Norwegian] I think maybe I have
a friend in the Department of Industry...

42:06.800 --> 42:08.680
[in English] Listen,
last time, you mentioned

42:08.760 --> 42:10.840
something about financial motivation...

42:10.920 --> 42:12.920
Yeah, I did.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.520
But now, this is all the motivation
we need, pally.

42:17.680 --> 42:19.800
Make that fucking phone call.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.320
Yep.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.160
[Frank]  What do you think of this joint?

42:36.240 --> 42:39.400
Looks nice.

42:39.480 --> 42:41.560
Good enough to own?

42:41.640 --> 42:43.600
Of course it's good enough to own.
[chuckles]

42:43.680 --> 42:46.000
What do you think?

42:46.120 --> 42:49.800
Well, I bought it.

42:49.920 --> 42:52.960
I need a partner.
I'm thinking about you.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.040
Me?

42:57.200 --> 42:58.800
You bought it?

42:58.880 --> 43:01.720
[chuckles] Yep.

43:01.800 --> 43:03.520
Take a look.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.880
[stammering]

43:06.960 --> 43:09.600
[in Norwegian]
But how much is this gonna cost me?

43:09.680 --> 43:12.040
Nothing.

43:12.120 --> 43:15.240
You sign at the bottom,
then you're a bar owner.

43:15.320 --> 43:17.280
[in Norwegian]
Are you kidding?

43:20.880 --> 43:23.360
[in English]
You're not shitting me right now?

43:23.440 --> 43:25.720
[laughs]

43:25.800 --> 43:29.520
[in Norwegian]   You're the fuckin'
classiest immigrant I've met.

43:29.600 --> 43:31.440
[in English]
I'll take that as a yes?

43:31.520 --> 43:34.280
You bet your ass it's a yes.

43:34.360 --> 43:36.080
Torgeir Lien.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.640
I'm a bar owner now!

43:37.720 --> 43:40.720
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir!

43:40.880 --> 43:43.040
Why don't you pour us
a little celebration libation?

43:43.120 --> 43:44.560
Sure, Giovanni.

43:44.640 --> 43:46.560
Look at me, I'm a bar owner!

43:50.920 --> 43:53.200
[in Norwegian] This could be
a new start for me, Giovanni.

43:53.280 --> 43:54.560
[in English]
Call me Johnny.

43:54.640 --> 43:57.120
Okay, I'll call you Johnny.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.880
To new beginnings.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.360
New beginnings.

44:00.440 --> 44:03.520
- And early fucking spring.
- Yeah.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.640
- [in Norwegian] Cheers.
-  Cheers.

"To my number one fan, Frank."

44:11.760 --> 44:14.360
[in Norwegian]
Who's Frank then?

44:14.440 --> 44:15.960
[in English]
Somebody I used to know.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.080
In another life.

44:19.160 --> 44:20.480
Okay.

44:25.320 --> 44:30.200
[in Norwegian] This is Laila Hovland,
chief of police in Lillehammer.

44:30.280 --> 44:35.280
I'd like to run a background check
on Giovanni Henriksen.

44:36.680 --> 44:39.200
Giovanni. Yeah.

44:43.640 --> 44:45.000
Oh?

44:45.080 --> 44:48.680
