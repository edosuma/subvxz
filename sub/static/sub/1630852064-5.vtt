WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:02.502
.

00:02.585 --> 00:06.339
It is my stop, and we will
be in for an intense night.

00:06.631 --> 00:08.967
There were people
inside these walls,

00:09.050 --> 00:11.219
rotting while they were still alive.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.347
This is where I die.

00:14.431 --> 00:18.476
We would estimate the number of
deaths in the building to be well
over 1,000.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.103
This is terrifying.

00:20.186 --> 00:24.274
My biggest fear is any spirit will
come after me because I'm here.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.151
What the (BLEEP) was that?

00:26.234 --> 00:29.904
We've seen full-bodied apparitions
on more than one occasion.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.823
(BLEEPING)

00:31.906 --> 00:33.658
The music box is going off!

00:33.742 --> 00:35.618
Are you a resident here?

00:39.330 --> 00:41.416
My name is Dakota Laden.

00:41.499 --> 00:44.753
I'm leading my sister and two best
friends on a road trip,

00:45.545 --> 00:48.465
exploring the most haunted locations
in America...

00:48.548 --> 00:50.633
(WOMAN SCREAMING) Oh, my God!

00:57.390 --> 00:58.850
I'm freaked out.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.477
..experimenting with fear

01:00.560 --> 01:03.813
and how it affects our interaction
with the paranormal.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.858
Each night,
we separate and sleep alone.

01:07.984 --> 01:11.488
The catch is - only one of us knows
where we're going.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.808
All right.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.976
We are half-way through the trip.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.063
And it is my stop.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.983
Dakota has his theories about fear
and the paranormal,

01:49.609 --> 01:51.861
one being that untapped locations

01:51.945 --> 01:54.447
sometimes result
in greater activity,

01:55.323 --> 01:58.201
simply because they've been
undisturbed for so long.

01:58.284 --> 02:02.706
If this deems to be true, we will
be in for an intense night.

02:03.873 --> 02:07.127
We are going to an eerie,
vacant, almshouse,

02:07.752 --> 02:12.465
ironically situated in the charming
little town of Waynesburg,
Pennsylvania.

02:13.925 --> 02:18.847
Opened 150 years ago, the almshouse
was supposed to provide solace

02:18.930 --> 02:20.682
to the area's poor,

02:20.765 --> 02:23.893
but instead they found horrible
suffering and abuse.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.899
The residents were tormented
by the superintendents,

02:30.692 --> 02:33.945
starved and forced to live
with vermin and bugs.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.199
There was a terrifying dungeon
in the basement

02:38.825 --> 02:41.911
and a ceiling mount
used to chain residents.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.790
People told me they have seen
an apparition

02:45.874 --> 02:49.336
that they believe is the spirit of
the most abusive superintendent

02:49.419 --> 02:51.504
to have ever worked here.

02:52.589 --> 02:56.885
They have had things thrown at them,
and also have been touched.

02:58.136 --> 03:02.390
But it's the kitchen that I fear
we might not be ready for,

03:02.891 --> 03:06.978
as the tragedy that happened
in there is unimaginable.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.940
This location has never
been explored before.

03:11.024 --> 03:15.820
We will be the first to document it
with cameras rolling all night long.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.948
The guys have not recovered
from our last location,

03:19.032 --> 03:21.451
and knowing what's
going to happen today,

03:21.534 --> 03:24.829
I just really hope that Alex's
resentment towards Tanner

03:24.913 --> 03:27.374
does not turn towards me.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.259
Everyone is so edgy.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.928
Oh, my gosh.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.597
I'm doing just fine, I feel great.
I'm OK.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.766
Alex, how are you
doing over there?

03:44.849 --> 03:47.977
Probably about the same as you.
I'm pretty pissed off.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.231
Are you still feeling the effects
of the last location?

03:51.314 --> 03:52.857
I'm nervous about this whole thing.

03:52.941 --> 03:57.028
At the last location, I get chained,
as an experiment, to a door.

03:57.987 --> 04:00.532
It hurts my wrist.
(GROANS)

04:00.615 --> 04:02.701
I drop my walkie...
(CLATTERING)

04:04.244 --> 04:07.205
Tanner checks in on me
but doesn't actually check in on me.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.374
Tanner for Alex.
Finally!

04:09.457 --> 04:11.543
We are done.
Cool!

04:11.626 --> 04:13.878
Let's meet up in the gear room.
I'm locked!

04:13.962 --> 04:16.798
We're supposed to be a team.
Isn't that the thing here?

04:16.881 --> 04:19.926
(LAUGHS) I mean, come on.
It's not that big of a deal.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.346
OK. Let's see how you like it
when you're handcuffed.

04:23.430 --> 04:27.517
I left it up to fate and I don't get
why everyone's complaining so much.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.687
It could've been anyone. Chelsea
hasn't been yelling out that much.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.063
Why are you not mad?

04:32.147 --> 04:36.026
Cos it's an experiment and we've all
been screwing with each other.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.861
And she gets it.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.530
I don't know. I think she's got
something up her sleeve.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.323
What do you have in store for us?

04:42.407 --> 04:45.618
My entire portion of the road trip
has a theme. OK.

04:45.702 --> 04:51.082
And it's about the anticipation of
fear and the fear of the unknown.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.378
What? The place I picked,
it's definitely haunted.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.590
I didn't want you having an upper
hand because you knew more.

04:58.673 --> 05:01.676
Every single one of you
is going in blindly.

05:02.385 --> 05:06.056
Which leads me to our next stop.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.432
What are we doing?

05:07.515 --> 05:10.310
I found this awesome idea
on the internet.

05:10.393 --> 05:14.522
OK.
And I think that it's a perfect way

05:14.606 --> 05:16.775
to get you warmed up
for my location.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.943
Are we going to it right now?
Yes.

05:19.027 --> 05:23.406
I actually have to set some things
up before you guys come out.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.617
So you guys can just relax
until then.

05:25.700 --> 05:30.288
All in favour of just taking the RV
and leaving as soon as she gets out?

05:36.044 --> 05:38.338
Hang tight and I'll come back
and get ya.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.965
OK. Knucks.
Get out of here. No!

05:41.049 --> 05:42.592
OK.
Bye, Chels.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.511
Bye, guys.
See ya.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.471
Dude, I hate your sister.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.602
What the hell
do you think she's doing?

05:52.686 --> 05:56.356
I have no idea but the fact
that she took herself out of it

05:56.439 --> 05:59.567
makes me feel like it's gonna
be something horrible.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.155
I think my sister
is losing her marbles.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.741
Guys, take out
some of the camera cases,

06:06.825 --> 06:09.244
you're going to be using them
to sit down.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.538
Place them over there.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.790
The heck is this?
I don't like this.

06:13.873 --> 06:18.211
This whole activity is based
on the fear of the unknown.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.671
Here's the plan.
Oh, boy!

06:19.754 --> 06:21.840
So we'll go one at a time.

06:21.923 --> 06:25.719
The first person will come up,
you'll be blindfolded temporarily

06:25.802 --> 06:29.639
while we get the unknown object
into the box.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.350
Then, when you're ready,
you'll turn around

06:32.434 --> 06:34.310
and put your hand into the box.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.231
And let us know
what you think you feel.

06:38.314 --> 06:41.234
I hate this. I've known you guys
for a very long time,

06:41.317 --> 06:43.069
so I know what you're scared of.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.322
If there's a snake, I'm going to
puke. I hate snakes.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.074
First person up!

06:48.158 --> 06:50.118
Tanner, you're the lucky one.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.746
What? Why me?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.456
Lots of reasons.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.751
Oh, my God!

06:58.752 --> 07:01.588
All right, Tanner.
I'm going to turn you around.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.299
You're going to take this off.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.885
You got it!

07:06.968 --> 07:09.346
Oh!
Just keep going down, nice and slow.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.349
Like, put your finger out.
(LAUGHS)

07:12.432 --> 07:14.601
No. OK.
You might want to do it quick,

07:14.684 --> 07:16.519
so it doesn't realise
you're in there.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.897
You got this Tanner, you got this!
This is so stupid!

07:18.980 --> 07:20.690
What do you think it is?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.067
Whoa! Eurgh!

07:22.150 --> 07:24.027
It's scaley. Chameleon?

07:24.110 --> 07:27.364
It's bigger than that. What do you
mean, it's bigger than that?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.407
Look. Check it out,
what you just touched.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.201
What in the hell!

07:32.118 --> 07:33.703
Is it moving?
Yeah!

07:33.787 --> 07:35.455
Can I take it off?
Yes!

07:36.706 --> 07:39.042
Is it going to bite?
To be honest, no, no.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.295
The worst possible image is coming
to my head. Like, a snake.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.756
I would literally, just, like...
Scoop it? Yeah!

07:46.174 --> 07:48.259
(GASPS AND SCREAMS)

07:49.886 --> 07:52.514
Great job!
What the hell? That's a huge bowl!

07:53.723 --> 07:55.100
You got it.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.396
That's, like, straight out
of the Bible.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.356
I'll take that.
I'm not doing this!

08:03.525 --> 08:06.027
Is it going to hurt me?
No, I don't think so.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.196
Just... you know?
You got this, Al.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.241
I can't!
Oh, you were so close!

08:11.324 --> 08:12.992
You got it!

08:13.076 --> 08:14.577
Eurgh!

08:14.661 --> 08:16.621
Take a look!

08:16.705 --> 08:18.665
Oh, my God.
(LAUGHS)

08:18.748 --> 08:20.333
They're everywhere!

08:22.377 --> 08:24.462
Don't do it.
(LAUGHS)

08:26.297 --> 08:28.174
Now's your chance.
Yeah, go.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.386
Straight down, go slow.
Go, go go, go go, go!

08:32.512 --> 08:34.097
(YELLS)
(LAUGHS)

08:36.766 --> 08:39.811
You're wasting so much!
Dude, I don't want to do it!

08:39.894 --> 08:41.688
If it's a snake,
I am never ever going in.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.356
It's not a snake!

08:45.108 --> 08:46.651
(LAUGHS)

08:47.652 --> 08:50.780
Now go straight to the glass, to me.
This is perfect. Hurry.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.241
This way. Perfect.
This is your moment.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.244
That was a fucking snake!

08:56.327 --> 08:58.204
Oh, my God! There's two of them!

08:58.288 --> 09:01.291
There's five!
There's five snakes! I'll kill you!

09:14.054 --> 09:17.932
I don't even want to know
what's in that packet
after what we just went through.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.768
It's about to get
a lot more intense.

09:19.851 --> 09:22.312
Dakota, do you want to open
this packet?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.481
I'm scared to put my hand in.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.942
"Greene County Almshouse."

09:28.610 --> 09:31.488
And we'll be the first group
to explore the entire night.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.324
Oh, my God!
When we do places like that,

09:34.407 --> 09:36.785
I feel like we always get
more activity.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.248
"Discreetly set off
an idyllic country road

09:42.332 --> 09:46.711
in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania,
can be found the unassuming remains

09:46.795 --> 09:49.631
of the former
Greene County Almshouse.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.386
For decades, this institution's halls
were consumed

09:54.469 --> 09:58.348
by the suffering, anguish and despair
from the local indigent,

09:58.431 --> 10:01.059
impoverished and unwanted."

10:02.435 --> 10:05.105
The Greene County Alms Home
was considered to be

10:05.188 --> 10:07.816
the worst institution
in the state of Pennsylvania.

10:07.899 --> 10:12.445
There were people inside these walls
rotting while they were still alive.

10:13.697 --> 10:16.157
You're lumping a whole group
of people together

10:16.241 --> 10:18.493
who have different sorts of needs

10:18.576 --> 10:22.414
and medical needs into,
really, one category

10:22.497 --> 10:24.582
that's very, very broad.

10:24.666 --> 10:28.336
And it got so overcrowded, they even
had to put 16 men up in the attic,

10:28.420 --> 10:30.046
which was not ventilated.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.549
It was gross.
Diseases spread rapidly up there.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.637
"Eventually the facility
expanded to add 24 more rooms,

10:37.721 --> 10:40.348
but even though they may have
had more space,

10:40.432 --> 10:42.225
their abuse continued."

10:42.308 --> 10:45.687
One report said there were
two cages up on the second floor

10:45.770 --> 10:47.856
that they would lock them inside of.

10:47.939 --> 10:51.651
It was known to be infested with
rats, vermin, mice.

10:51.735 --> 10:55.697
People were sleeping in the hallways
on piles of dirty clothes.

10:55.780 --> 10:59.451
"By 1890,
the situation had gotten so dire

10:59.534 --> 11:02.037
that the residents wrote
to the local paper

11:02.120 --> 11:08.168
hoping to expose the truly appalling
behaviour of caretaker William Cage."

11:09.544 --> 11:11.963
He was forcing people
to bathe in the creek out back

11:12.047 --> 11:14.632
in the wintertime
in freezing conditions.

11:15.175 --> 11:19.054
If an individual wasn't able to
perform the work he wanted them to,

11:19.804 --> 11:21.890
he would beat them with his cane.

11:21.973 --> 11:25.226
He would lock them in the basement
in what he called the dungeon

11:25.310 --> 11:28.104
for the smallest of offences,
whether they were violent,

11:28.188 --> 11:29.939
or whether they
just got on his nerves,

11:30.023 --> 11:33.818
he'd take them down into the
basement and chain them to the wall,
and leave them there.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.653
So there's a dungeon here too?

11:35.737 --> 11:37.614
I know exactly
why you picked this place.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.325
No one's getting out of
my location easy, OK?

11:41.993 --> 11:45.413
As steward, he had the power
to walk the streets of the town

11:45.497 --> 11:48.708
and simply grab anyone
he thought belonged in the home

11:49.376 --> 11:52.295
and admit them, no questions asked.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.883
He was a man that was definitely
on a power trip.

11:56.966 --> 12:01.721
And unfortunately, it caused
so much harm to so many people.

12:02.931 --> 12:06.476
Around the turn of the century,
we had a female resident here

12:06.559 --> 12:08.853
who had become pregnant
by another inmate.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.690
And the child that she had
that was born here

12:11.773 --> 12:14.609
we believe died through
the middle of the night.

12:15.318 --> 12:19.989
To warm the child up, she placed it
in the bread oven in the bake shop.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.659
All the residents and inmates
woke up that morning

12:22.742 --> 12:24.577
and they smelled
something cooking.

12:24.661 --> 12:28.415
When they went and inspected that
kitchen and they opened that oven,

12:28.498 --> 12:30.583
they found this woman's baby.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.670
Super disturbing and
incredibly heart-breaking.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.173
"Her loss was so profound
that it is said

12:37.257 --> 12:40.385
that her soul still lingers
in the Almshouse kitchen,

12:40.468 --> 12:42.679
desperate to be
close to her child again

12:42.762 --> 12:45.890
and seek forgiveness
for her tragic mistake."

12:46.808 --> 12:50.895
That is honestly one of the saddest
things we have ever read.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.064
That's so disturbing.

12:53.857 --> 12:57.193
"Due to improper records,
no one knows the true toll

12:57.277 --> 13:01.239
the years of mistreatment took
on the residents of Greene County."

13:02.073 --> 13:06.202
We know of around 746 recorded
deaths in the building.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.621
However, our records
are not complete.

13:08.705 --> 13:12.959
We would estimate the actual number
to be well over 1,000.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.545
When they buried them
in that county cemetery,

13:15.628 --> 13:18.131
they didn't even care enough
to give them a headstone.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.134
"With a history so dark
and upsetting,

13:21.551 --> 13:25.305
it is no wonder that the spirits
inside have been unable to rest.

13:25.388 --> 13:29.642
They are still linked to the source
of their oppression and heartbreak."

13:30.518 --> 13:35.315
My biggest fear is any sort of
spirit or entity that is angry,

13:35.398 --> 13:37.275
and they should be angry,

13:37.359 --> 13:40.195
will come after me because I'm here.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.575
We've seen full-bodied apparitions
on more than one occasion.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.746
"The most active areas
include the west wing."

13:52.040 --> 13:54.542
That was the female ward
of the institution.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.629
If all the doors are shut and
haven't been opened for a while,

13:57.712 --> 14:01.591
you'll hear sometimes knocking on
the doors as if somebody wants out.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.261
We've had people report
the smell of burning hair up here.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.056
"Second floor corridor.

14:08.139 --> 14:13.269
Located in the main building,
this area is known for
poltergeist activity."

14:14.396 --> 14:18.108
I had come up the front staircase
and was heading down the hallway

14:18.191 --> 14:21.194
to the back of the building,
and I heard a door slam.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.739
Something was walking around pacing,
it sounded like.

14:24.823 --> 14:27.117
And a box came sliding down
the hallway at me.

14:28.118 --> 14:33.039
"People also witnessed an apparition
of a man in late 1800s clothing

14:33.123 --> 14:35.583
who they believe is William Cage."

14:35.667 --> 14:39.295
Which means he's not going to be
a nice thing if we run into him.

14:39.379 --> 14:44.217
And if he actually is there,
that means he's probably still
controlling all the spirits.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.971
"The dungeon."

14:50.140 --> 14:53.143
When I'm in the dungeon,
I feel utterly terrified.

14:53.810 --> 14:58.773
"Those who venture into this area
feel eyes on them following
their every move,

14:58.857 --> 15:02.360
as the agitated whispers
and strong scent of sewage

15:02.444 --> 15:06.239
make them feel uneasy
and off-balance."

15:06.322 --> 15:09.075
Please, for the love of God,
please don't send me there.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.453
It'll be difficult for everyone,
including myself.

15:11.536 --> 15:14.956
So, you're putting yourself into
this situation, unlike today?

15:15.040 --> 15:16.624
Yes.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.306
Touching snakes left and right.
I'm putting that on my new bio.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.933
I can't believe you made us do
that yesterday, Chelsea.

15:34.017 --> 15:37.479
I've never seen you guys
so scared. Not me? Us?

15:37.562 --> 15:40.065
No! That was bravery.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.109
Technically,
overcoming fear is bravery.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.945
But you guys were scared shitless.

15:46.029 --> 15:49.532
I have a question for you. You've had
a lot more time to think about this.

15:49.616 --> 15:53.453
Is there a room or area that you're
dreading being in, or seeing?

15:53.536 --> 15:56.289
There's a lot of spots
I don't feel comfortable with.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.333
Obviously, the dungeon
is just terrifying.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.834
I've been there, done that.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.046
Someone else will do that.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.006
Is it up to fate?
No.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.175
(LAUGHTER)
Whoa, OK.

16:08.093 --> 16:11.680
I mean, I get it. Why leave it up
to fate when you can just choose?

16:11.763 --> 16:13.098
Exactly!

16:13.181 --> 16:15.642
Usually, I like doing things
as a team.

16:15.725 --> 16:20.230
But I'm feeling
a little rebellious to that.

16:20.313 --> 16:24.025
I'm very scared about this dungeon.
Especially after yesterday.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.069
I love you. I just don't trust you.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.201
Getting close, aren't we?
Just go easy on us, please.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.578
I'm not going to make this
an easy stop.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.500
Oh, man, here we go.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.421
Oh, my God!
Oh, my goodness!

16:44.504 --> 16:46.172
It's right there!

16:47.048 --> 16:50.135
That's what we're dealing with?
Oh, my God!

16:51.511 --> 16:53.596
It doesn't even look abandoned.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.640
We're dead.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.863
We're going to walk the
whole property before we go in.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.201
I do not like this.
Me neither.

17:16.786 --> 17:20.957
This is pretty freaky! We need you,
as a leader, to be confident now!

17:21.041 --> 17:22.667
Confidently scared.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.924
We just got settled
in the gear room.

17:30.008 --> 17:33.011
All of our equipment
is set up in this barn.

17:33.678 --> 17:36.014
And Dakota? What?
You're coming with me.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.892
Where are we going?
You're going to the dungeon.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.643
Right now?
Right now.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.355
We just got here. I feel like
I'm just getting settled.

17:43.438 --> 17:47.359
We're just getting started.
And you are starting in the dungeon.

17:47.442 --> 17:51.237
You're going to put
your brother in a dungeon?

17:51.321 --> 17:53.239
What is wrong with you?

17:53.323 --> 17:55.200
I think I've heard that line before.

17:55.283 --> 17:58.411
All you need is a piece of
equipment and a flashlight.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.747
No walkie.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.582
No walkie?
No walkie.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.918
What if something happens?
I just scream?

18:05.001 --> 18:08.213
If you can yell that loud.
I fucking hope so.

18:08.296 --> 18:11.758
Alex, Tanner, come with me. We got
to get this guy into the dungeon.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.260
I think that might be the hardest
part. It's time to go.

18:14.344 --> 18:18.139
This is actually really scary.
You guys suck! What's happening?

18:18.223 --> 18:20.308
Come on, get out.
Let's go. Get going.

18:20.392 --> 18:23.353
So, I'm just going to start off
in the dungeon? This is sick.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.147
I don't even get to hang out
with you guys? Nope.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.525
You're gonna be in there
for a long time, actually.

18:28.608 --> 18:33.780
We haven't even been in there yet
and my first time is getting
locked in a dungeon. This way.

18:33.863 --> 18:37.534
My gosh. Seriously,
I actually hate this.

18:42.497 --> 18:45.083
Screw this!
Oh, my!

18:48.545 --> 18:50.088
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

18:50.171 --> 18:52.257
This is scary!

18:52.340 --> 18:54.384
No way!

18:54.467 --> 18:56.177
What?

18:57.262 --> 18:59.848
My gosh, this is actually so scary.

18:59.931 --> 19:03.018
Goodnight, Dakota! See you, dude!
You're just leaving me?

19:03.101 --> 19:06.438
I don't even get to be with you
guys? Bye, Dakota! OK, bye.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.108
Wait, are you actually locking it?

19:10.191 --> 19:11.735
OK, see you buddy!

19:13.194 --> 19:14.696
That's bullshit!

19:14.779 --> 19:18.324
Walkie us if you need anything!
How? I don't have a walkie!

19:18.408 --> 19:20.869
Well, that sucks,
you should have brought one.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.331
Man, that felt good.
I wouldn't doubt it.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.709
You got a little bit of revenge
there. I know.

19:27.792 --> 19:32.630
But don't get too comfortable
because we are about to do solos.

19:32.714 --> 19:35.925
Are we put in a certain
spot or do we roam around or what?

19:36.760 --> 19:38.511
The building is your oyster.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.348
You can navigate it as you please.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.850
But try to hit as many spots
as you can.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.770
(SIGHS) I was literally just going
to sit in the entry way.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.523
So Tanner just wrote down all of
our names on the piece of paper.

19:51.608 --> 19:54.069
And now it is time to draw.

19:54.152 --> 19:57.655
Who's gonna draw?
You are gonna draw tonight.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.074
OK.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.415
Al! (LAUGHS)

20:07.499 --> 20:09.209
That says "Alex"!

20:09.292 --> 20:11.378
Alex, you're going first!

20:12.212 --> 20:16.341
I literally have the worst luck in
every single draw. It was just fate.

20:16.424 --> 20:19.386
You're up! Let's go.
Fate!

20:20.220 --> 20:21.429
(SIGHS)

20:21.513 --> 20:25.016
This sucks! Oh, my God!

20:25.100 --> 20:27.227
Just the look of this building
right now.

20:27.310 --> 20:30.522
This is worse than your mystery box,
Chelsea.

20:30.605 --> 20:33.525
Instead of sticking my hand in,
I'm just throwing myself in!

20:34.818 --> 20:36.111
Oh, my gosh.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.279
Seriously, already hate this.

20:39.114 --> 20:42.492
I'm going to look around and see
what the heck is even down here.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.203
Oh, my gosh!

20:47.038 --> 20:50.208
Well, I thought that was a door
that would open and it fell.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.378
I'm just going to act like that
didn't happen.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.797
I don't even know what's
happening right now.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.217
I don't know why I'm down here,
how long I'm going to be down here.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.555
So, I don't think
Dakota knows that I'm in here.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.767
(WHISPERS) I'm just going to give
him a nice little kick to the door.

21:08.727 --> 21:10.520
I don't know what
they're even doing.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.439
Like, what is actually...
(KICKING)

21:12.522 --> 21:14.607
What the fuck was that?

21:17.152 --> 21:19.237
That was loud, like a stomp.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.364
Chelsea, was that you?

21:21.448 --> 21:23.491
Guys?
It's me!

21:23.575 --> 21:25.285
Oh! It's you!

21:25.368 --> 21:27.537
Yeah!
Chelsea's making us do solos!

21:28.413 --> 21:30.290
Why?
I don't know!

21:30.373 --> 21:32.459
Your sister is messed up
in the head!

21:33.126 --> 21:36.087
I guess this means I have a lot
more time down here than I thought.

21:36.171 --> 21:38.256
Time to get comfortable.

21:39.549 --> 21:41.634
OK, I have no idea where I'm going.

21:41.718 --> 21:44.346
I'm just kind of wandering around
right now.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.603
Oh, my God.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.773
I just made it up
to the women's ward.

21:55.857 --> 21:58.485
This was all a part
of the original poor farm.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.113
Is there anyone up here?

22:09.204 --> 22:11.206
I'll keep moving.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.007
It's like stepping back in time.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.852
We're on the second floor corridor.

22:33.687 --> 22:35.605
This is known
for poltergeist activity.

22:35.689 --> 22:40.402
This is also where William Cage
lived while he worked here.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.573
I swear I keep hearing footsteps.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.245
Hello?

22:57.085 --> 23:00.088
I think what I'm going to do
is set up a wide camera

23:00.171 --> 23:03.883
and I'm going to whip out some gear
and start asking some questions.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.760
I just set up the quad.

23:05.844 --> 23:08.263
What the quad does is pick up
vibrations.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.515
So if anyone walks by this...

23:10.598 --> 23:12.726
(BLEEPING)

23:12.809 --> 23:14.894
just like that, it'll go off.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.605
William Cage?

23:17.689 --> 23:19.774
Are you here with me right now?

23:23.153 --> 23:26.489
If you walk towards me
and step into this room,

23:26.573 --> 23:30.243
this device in front of me will go
off and let me know you're here.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.581
I've heard all about you.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.126
I've heard what you did
to the people here.

23:46.509 --> 23:49.471
Wait a second. No way!

23:49.554 --> 23:53.767
This cane right in front of me,
is the same cane, I'm pretty sure,

23:53.850 --> 23:57.270
that William Cage used
to beat people here.

23:57.354 --> 24:00.607
I'm gonna see what's inside this
room where his cane is.

24:04.778 --> 24:06.654
What is this?

24:08.823 --> 24:10.450
Oh, my gosh!

24:10.533 --> 24:12.327
No way!

24:12.410 --> 24:15.955
When William Cage was unhappy with
someone and wanted to punish them,

24:16.039 --> 24:17.415
he would shackle them up.

24:17.499 --> 24:20.251
These are the exact same shackles,
these aren't replicas.

24:20.335 --> 24:24.005
These are the same shackles from
back when it was operational.

24:24.673 --> 24:27.801
Oh, my gosh, that's very unsettling
to see in person.

24:29.469 --> 24:32.305
(EXHALES) OK, I'm gonna get
out of this one.

24:34.933 --> 24:36.810
OK.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.690
OK, William.

24:41.773 --> 24:44.526
if you don't want to talk to me, if
you don't want to walk next to me,

24:44.609 --> 24:48.446
if you don't want to come into this
room, I'll stop bothering you.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.576
(DISTANT THUDDING)
Holy... Holy shit!

24:54.160 --> 24:56.162
I just heard a knock down there.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.998
Clearly something
is messing with me.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.252
I'm not getting anything
on the quad.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.921
I'm gonna try to go to that room
where I just heard a knock

25:05.005 --> 25:07.048
and take some photos.

25:07.132 --> 25:09.801
If there's someone down here,
I just heard you.

25:09.884 --> 25:12.012
Step towards this light, this flash.

25:15.056 --> 25:17.142
I'll take some in here.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.604
I'm gonna look through these photos.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.273
Nothing.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.402
Nothing.

25:30.530 --> 25:31.823
Nothing.

25:31.906 --> 25:34.075
Whatever made that knock
and that noise,

25:34.951 --> 25:37.996
clearly just doesn't want
to communicate at all.

25:39.664 --> 25:42.417
So, I have definitely been in here
for over an hour now.

25:42.500 --> 25:45.337
It is time for one of
the other two to come in here.

25:47.297 --> 25:51.593
All right, it's time to figure out
who goes next.

25:51.676 --> 25:54.179
I really don't want to go.
I don't either.

25:54.262 --> 25:57.724
I'm just hoping a miracle happens,
where I don't have to go.

26:00.185 --> 26:02.062
All right, we'll do this one.
Oh, no.

26:04.064 --> 26:06.024
No, man!

26:06.107 --> 26:07.650
(LAUGHS)

26:07.734 --> 26:10.612
I knew I should have picked
the other one! No!

26:10.695 --> 26:12.947
Dang, that sucks!

26:13.031 --> 26:14.866
This is so dumb.

26:14.949 --> 26:16.826
All right, man. Oh, OK.

26:16.910 --> 26:19.496
You got this.
See you, guys. You got this.

26:19.579 --> 26:22.916
Off to a scary, abandoned location,
all by myself.

26:24.876 --> 26:26.836
I really need to find new friends.

26:28.213 --> 26:32.133
Oh, my goodness.
It is so much colder in here.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.221
This is where Dakota is,
he's in the dungeon.

26:38.348 --> 26:39.933
It's really faint,

26:40.016 --> 26:43.478
but I'm almost certain it's pouring
rain outside right now.

26:43.561 --> 26:45.355
Hey, Dakota?
Whoa!

26:45.438 --> 26:47.482
Tanner?
Hey!

26:47.565 --> 26:49.609
Oh, shit!
How you doing?

26:49.693 --> 26:51.236
Oh, my God!

26:51.319 --> 26:54.656
Sorry, probably should have given
you a warning. That's my bad, bro.

26:54.739 --> 26:57.826
You doing all right?
I don't even know any more!

26:57.909 --> 27:00.078
You sound like you're going crazy
down there.

27:00.161 --> 27:03.248
I feel like I'm going crazy
down here, this sucks!

27:03.331 --> 27:06.501
I wish I could unlock this door,
but I think I'd get in trouble.

27:06.584 --> 27:09.713
You could, we don't have to tell her.
Well...

27:11.423 --> 27:14.259
Just leave it locked.
I'm sorry!

27:14.342 --> 27:16.428
It's totally fine.

27:19.764 --> 27:23.351
All right, so this is
a digital recorder.

27:23.435 --> 27:27.564
A digital recorder is said to pick up
frequencies our ears cannot hear.

27:27.647 --> 27:30.442
And it's said that it can pick up
spirit voices.

27:30.525 --> 27:33.069
I'll bring the digital recorder
into this room behind me

27:33.153 --> 27:35.655
with the shackles
and just let it roll.

27:36.656 --> 27:41.453
I am rolling on the digital recorder
in the dungeon shackle room,

27:41.536 --> 27:43.621
I'm going to step out.

27:52.922 --> 27:54.382
(EXHALES)

27:54.466 --> 27:58.762
If there's somebody down here, speak
and I will be able to hear you.

27:58.845 --> 28:03.850
I have something in this room behind
me that if you go in there and talk,

28:03.933 --> 28:06.019
I'll be able to hear you.

28:06.978 --> 28:09.189
Who is down here,
who is in this room?

28:09.272 --> 28:11.358
What is your message for the world?

28:14.527 --> 28:19.157
When I say the name William Cage,
what do you think of?

28:20.325 --> 28:23.953
What would you say to him if you
could say something right now?

28:26.164 --> 28:29.334
How would you describe
the Greene County Almshouse

28:29.626 --> 28:31.378
when it was operational?

28:31.461 --> 28:33.546
What was this place like?

28:36.341 --> 28:39.427
When someone was punished
and shackled down here,

28:39.511 --> 28:42.430
what would happen to them
in this room behind me?

28:49.229 --> 28:51.481
All right, I'm gonna go
get the recorder.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.905
I am now going to play this back.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.992
'Who is down here,

Wow!

29:54.502 --> 29:56.463
You can just feel it.

29:56.546 --> 29:59.883
Feel all the pain and the trauma
that happened down here.

30:02.093 --> 30:04.220
Did you read anything
about this barn?

30:04.304 --> 30:08.600
Is it supposed to be haunted too?
Or is this a newer-built structure?

30:08.683 --> 30:10.477
It's definitely not newer,

30:10.560 --> 30:13.897
but I don't have
any information about it.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.523
Shit.

Dude! Are you kidding me? This is
not supposed to be the scary part.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.118
Dude, what the hell made
that noise?

30:27.202 --> 30:29.871
I feel like something, like,
followed you in here.

30:30.955 --> 30:33.208
Why would you
say something like that?

30:33.291 --> 30:37.128
I don't know, it's just what I was
thinking, and what I was feeling.

30:43.968 --> 30:46.054
And this is where I die.

30:49.474 --> 30:51.351
OK, I hate creaky floors.

30:51.893 --> 30:54.646
You never know, when one
of the boards just snaps back,

30:54.729 --> 30:56.815
if it was you or something else.

freaking creaky-ass floors.

31:09.536 --> 31:11.579
Oh, what?

31:11.663 --> 31:14.582
Looks like I found the stairs
to the second floor.

(FLOORBOARDS CREAK)

31:26.052 --> 31:27.512
Oh.

31:28.346 --> 31:31.307
This is where all the women
and children were housed.

31:31.391 --> 31:33.685
I definitely don't feel alone
up here.

31:41.401 --> 31:43.236
Oh, my God!

31:45.530 --> 31:47.615
I do not like this at all.

31:49.993 --> 31:52.078
Is something up here with me?

31:56.416 --> 31:58.501
I'm gonna break out the music box.

31:58.585 --> 32:01.004
I'm going to try
to leave a camera up here.

32:01.087 --> 32:04.090
Leave the music box up here,
I'm gonna turn this on.

32:04.174 --> 32:07.844
If anything comes within its
vicinity, it'll trip the sensor,

32:07.927 --> 32:10.013
and start playing music.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.349
(SIGHS)

32:12.432 --> 32:14.809
OK, now that that's done,

32:15.935 --> 32:19.522
I'm gonna go explore
the first floor of the west wing.

32:22.359 --> 32:24.903
I've been down here for a long time.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.781
I am going to turn on the Ovilus.

32:28.531 --> 32:31.326
This is a device that has
a word database inside of it.

32:31.409 --> 32:34.371
It's believed that spirits can
manipulate the frequencies

32:34.454 --> 32:36.289
and choose whatever word they want.

32:36.373 --> 32:38.583
If there's something
down here with me,

32:38.667 --> 32:41.836
I have something in my hand that will
let you communicate with me,

32:41.920 --> 32:43.505
one word at a time.

32:43.588 --> 32:47.842
Can you tell me who you are, or what
your affiliation with this place is?

32:58.186 --> 33:00.271
Nothing so far.

33:01.564 --> 33:04.567
The longer I'm down here,
the harder it gets, honestly.

33:04.651 --> 33:06.319
(EXHALES)

33:06.403 --> 33:09.239
Really heavy.
Really heavy feelings down here.

33:13.910 --> 33:17.914
Going over towards
the west wing of the building.

33:18.540 --> 33:21.835
On the first floor,
this is where they kept all the men.

33:21.918 --> 33:23.628
I already don't feel good.

33:23.712 --> 33:25.797
I don't feel like I'm by myself.

33:29.801 --> 33:31.886
OK, I'm looking at a small chapel.

Oh, don't like this
in the slightest.

I know you were close.

34:17.307 --> 34:18.683
It's OK.

34:19.809 --> 34:22.437
I'm so fucking scared right now.

34:23.313 --> 34:25.190
Can you make that go off again?

34:30.320 --> 34:32.405
Are you a resident here?

34:33.990 --> 34:37.660
Something's watching me right now,
and I don't know what it is.

34:39.829 --> 34:42.123
Is there something here
that wants to hurt me?

34:42.207 --> 34:44.292
(MUSIC BOX GOES OFF)
Whoa!

34:45.377 --> 34:47.796
Dude, screw this, I'm done.
I'm done.

34:47.879 --> 34:49.422
My hour's up.

34:57.055 --> 34:59.391
God, I feel good to be
out of that building.

35:00.308 --> 35:02.352
OK, I'm done.
Dude!

35:03.311 --> 35:05.355
The music box went off!
What? What?

35:05.438 --> 35:08.066
I set up the music box,
I put it up on the second floor,

35:08.149 --> 35:11.486
all of a sudden I could hear it,
so I ran up to the music box,

35:11.569 --> 35:14.656
and the second I looked through
the hallway, it stopped.

35:14.739 --> 35:16.616
What?
The second I turned!

35:16.700 --> 35:19.119
Like, it just completely
freaked me out.

35:19.202 --> 35:20.870
I wasn't ready for it.
When I asked,

35:20.954 --> 35:23.498
"Does something here want
to hurt me?" it went off.

35:23.581 --> 35:26.626
Oh, my God!

35:26.710 --> 35:28.670
I'm done, I need a break.

35:32.507 --> 35:34.968
I've had the Ovilus on
for over an hour now

35:35.051 --> 35:36.886
and I got nothing.

35:36.970 --> 35:38.763
Absolutely nothing.

35:38.847 --> 35:40.932
(EXHALES)

35:41.016 --> 35:43.601
Nothing at all on the Ovilus,
that's crazy.

35:47.272 --> 35:49.357
(DISTANT THUDDING)

35:50.942 --> 35:53.028

35:56.031 --> 35:57.907
He's right above me.

35:59.617 --> 36:01.411
Hey, Tanner?

Hey, Tanner?

36:05.623 --> 36:07.375
No one's above me!

36:12.130 --> 36:13.381
Fuck.

36:13.465 --> 36:17.635
I just heard fucking movement right
above me, like Tanner was walking.

Hey, Tanner!

36:26.436 --> 36:28.521
That better have been one of them,

36:28.605 --> 36:31.941
because that was as loud
as you can get footsteps,

36:32.025 --> 36:34.652
like, I heard the creaking,
and everything!

36:36.321 --> 36:38.406

36:46.664 --> 36:48.833
And now, nothing, no movement.

36:50.543 --> 36:54.005
I swear to God, if he's not even
in the building right now...

36:55.799 --> 36:58.009
All right, it's time.

Wow.

37:49.436 --> 37:51.521
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Oh, gosh, no.

37:57.027 --> 37:59.112
No, no, no.

37:59.904 --> 38:02.198
Oh, gosh,
I think I know what this room is.

38:03.241 --> 38:05.326
This is the kitchen.

38:06.911 --> 38:10.540
And that is the infamous oven.

38:11.958 --> 38:14.878
I am going to set up another camera

38:14.961 --> 38:18.423
because I feel like I am going
to be spending some time here.

38:21.343 --> 38:24.429
This is, like, the most I have
ever been out of the loop.

38:24.512 --> 38:27.599
I really don't know what is
going on with the rest of the group.

38:28.183 --> 38:31.394
But I have a feeling, based off
what I have been hearing up there,

38:31.478 --> 38:33.772
that they are not having
a good night either.

38:33.855 --> 38:36.191
I'm just glad she didn't take
my flashlight away.

38:36.274 --> 38:39.194
Honestly, I don't know what I'd do
without a flashlight.

38:40.445 --> 38:45.700
This place is filled
with so much grief

38:47.077 --> 38:50.955
that it actually makes sense
that a mother,

38:51.039 --> 38:53.416
or any resident, for that matter,

38:53.500 --> 38:56.920
could lose their judgment
in a place like this.

38:57.003 --> 38:59.172
People have breaking points,

38:59.798 --> 39:05.053
and some of the things that
the residents here experienced

39:05.136 --> 39:08.515
are well beyond
my personal threshold.

39:11.935 --> 39:16.314
But the fact that
a person was so sad,

39:16.398 --> 39:21.861
that it led to them completely
losing their sense of judgment,

39:23.363 --> 39:28.034
your heart can only be broken
so far and so much.

39:32.789 --> 39:34.499
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

39:37.043 --> 39:42.966

Chelsea?

39:57.397 --> 39:59.357
Yeah, you're done!

39:59.441 --> 40:01.276
Oh, my God, thank you!

40:01.985 --> 40:03.570
I'm done!

40:08.283 --> 40:10.410
Oh, got it.
Oh!

40:11.619 --> 40:14.622
Dude, that sucked so bad!

40:15.540 --> 40:17.334
Oh, my God.
You're back!

40:17.417 --> 40:20.587
I mean, I was down there for
at least five and half hours,

40:20.670 --> 40:21.963
maybe even six.

40:22.047 --> 40:25.550
We don't even have enough time
to go to bed and do our sleeping.

40:25.633 --> 40:30.597
I think we should go in as a group
and explore the building together.

40:30.680 --> 40:34.559
That's a really good idea. I'm so
ready to see the rest of this place.

40:34.642 --> 40:38.396
I definitely agree with that,
I don't think we should sleep alone.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.774
And I'm not just saying that.

40:40.857 --> 40:42.400
(EXHALES)

40:51.242 --> 40:52.911
Oh, my gosh.

40:53.828 --> 40:56.664
So, Tanner, where did you
have your experience?

40:56.748 --> 40:58.667
Mine was on the second floor
of the west wing.

40:58.750 --> 41:02.420
Let's definitely hit that west wing
and try to get a follow-up.

41:03.463 --> 41:04.881
Hello?

41:04.964 --> 41:07.050
Is there somebody up here?

41:07.133 --> 41:08.426
Anybody?

41:10.804 --> 41:12.389
Jeez.

41:12.472 --> 41:14.557
It's right down this way.

41:19.396 --> 41:21.022
Oh, my gosh.

41:22.941 --> 41:24.984
Since there's not a lot of time left,

41:25.068 --> 41:28.446
let's just break out the music box,
set it down in the same spot,

41:28.530 --> 41:31.866
and just ask questions that can
maybe lead us to an answer

41:31.950 --> 41:34.452
on maybe who's here,
what's in this hallway.

41:35.161 --> 41:40.000
If we're talking to one of the women
or just one of the residents here,

41:40.792 --> 41:44.170
can you go up to that device
on the ground we just set down

41:44.254 --> 41:46.673
and step next to it
and make it play a song?

41:49.217 --> 41:51.553
I know that you can
turn that thing on.

41:51.636 --> 41:53.513
Can you do it one more time?

41:54.556 --> 41:56.433
Can you make the music box go off,

41:56.516 --> 42:00.979
if William Cage hurt you,
or you know someone that he hurt?

42:02.772 --> 42:05.775
(MUSIC BOX TINKLES)
Whoa! It's going off! It's going off.

42:05.859 --> 42:07.944
It stopped.

42:08.028 --> 42:10.071
That is so freaky.

42:10.155 --> 42:12.824
It answered your question.
Yeah, it answered my question.

42:12.907 --> 42:14.784
I don't think we're talking
to William,

42:14.868 --> 42:18.329
I think we are talking to someone
who was, like, a resident here.

42:18.413 --> 42:20.498
Can you make it go off again?

42:21.499 --> 42:24.336
Can you let us know
if William Cage is still here?

42:29.799 --> 42:32.427
(MUSIC BOX TINKLES)
Whoa! It's going off again!

42:32.510 --> 42:34.512
It's going off again!

42:34.596 --> 42:37.057
It stopped.
Oh, my gosh.

42:37.140 --> 42:40.560
I knew he came back,
I knew he was still here.

42:40.643 --> 42:43.772
So, we know now
that he abused this person,

42:43.855 --> 42:46.191
or at least this person
knows someone he abused.

42:46.274 --> 42:50.362
And whoever we're talking to is now
confirming William is still here.

42:50.945 --> 42:52.864
And we were asking lots of questions.

42:52.947 --> 42:56.076
It was just waiting for the right
question to answer.

42:58.828 --> 43:01.373
We're so sorry that you had
to go through this,

43:01.456 --> 43:05.335
that you had to come to this place
thinking it was gonna be helpful

43:05.418 --> 43:07.253
but it wasn't.

43:08.213 --> 43:10.924
Nobody should have to go through
what you did.

43:13.426 --> 43:16.221
It is fully lit outside.
You guys say we get out?

43:16.304 --> 43:19.933
I really do feel we have explored
this place from top to bottom.

43:20.016 --> 43:22.102
Let's get out of here.

43:22.185 --> 43:24.270
I'm good with that.

43:26.856 --> 43:31.486
When you're at a location where you
knew there was so much despair,

43:31.569 --> 43:33.697
so much sadness,

43:33.780 --> 43:36.825
it's really hard to not feel that.

43:36.908 --> 43:41.162
Chelsea tested our fear
from the moment she got control.

43:41.788 --> 43:45.250
And it didn't stop
for 48 hours straight.

43:46.209 --> 43:48.837
What freaked me out the most
was William Cage.

43:48.920 --> 43:51.506
I'm pretty sure he was next to me
the whole night.

43:51.589 --> 43:53.675
If that's how I felt for one night,

43:53.758 --> 43:58.138
I can't imagine living there
with that fear of that man.

43:59.681 --> 44:03.018
Chelsea actually used
some of my tactics against me.

44:03.101 --> 44:06.104
This was definitely
fear of the unknown for me.

44:06.187 --> 44:08.314
I had no clue what to expect.

44:08.398 --> 44:10.483
As soon as I heard about a dungeon,

44:10.567 --> 44:14.404
I kind of figured Dakota would be
stuck in there the entire night.

44:14.487 --> 44:16.781
When you look at that room,
it's obvious

44:16.865 --> 44:19.909
that a lot more happened down there
than we were told.

44:19.993 --> 44:22.412
I feel like I was really picking up
on that.

44:22.495 --> 44:25.415
I felt like I was starting
to lose my mind at times.

44:26.249 --> 44:28.960
I was hearing things,
thought I was seeing things.

44:29.044 --> 44:33.590
Putting my brother in the dungeon
for almost six hours,

44:33.673 --> 44:36.801
I feel really levelled things out.

44:36.885 --> 44:41.598
There is just a lot of unspoken
built-up angst between us

44:41.681 --> 44:43.767
and I think we're good now.

44:45.143 --> 44:47.228
Alex is up next.

44:47.312 --> 44:48.855
I am completely on edge.

44:48.938 --> 44:52.609
I know that he wants
some type of retaliation

44:52.692 --> 44:54.778
for handcuffing him to a jail cell.

44:54.861 --> 45:01.284
Alex has been a fly on the wall,
watching our every move,

45:01.368 --> 45:05.789
absorbing everybody's evil plans.

45:05.872 --> 45:09.834
And I know that he is about
to put us through

45:09.918 --> 45:13.004
something we've never
experienced before.

45:13.088 --> 45:17.801
Not only is my location pick
completely unique,

45:17.884 --> 45:19.969
it is full of secrets.

45:20.053 --> 45:23.932
I may have forgiven
what they've done this road trip,

45:24.015 --> 45:25.600
but I have not forgotten.

45:25.684 --> 45:27.769
And it's coming back to 'em.
