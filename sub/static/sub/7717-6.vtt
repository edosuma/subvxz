WEBVTT

00:05.960 --> 00:07.883
Can you guys come
with me for a minute?

00:09.480 --> 00:11.369
I know you saw me
with the Senator.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.087
I think I'm in love,
possibly for the first time.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.925
So, yes, Senator Lipton
and I are having an affair.

00:17.160 --> 00:23.281
I hope that I can count on your
sensitivity, maturity, and discretion.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.600
Why?

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:41.400 --> 00:42.890
All right, good, yeah.
Just sell it

00:42.960 --> 00:44.371
and get the best
price you can. Okay?

00:44.640 --> 00:46.324
Or we can hope
for a holiday rally.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.930
Mike. I'm not
a day trader.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.321
I'm just a first
responder in a disaster.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.603
Andy's family
had a total meltdown.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.284
His dad blew through
all their money and

00:54.360 --> 00:56.089
took off to Argentina
with a younger woman.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.010
And his brother, Walt, Jr.,
locked himself in the wine cellar.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.969
The weirdest part is Andy.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.090
The aftermath
got dumped on him,

01:03.160 --> 01:05.606
and the way he's been
handling it is just so...

01:06.200 --> 01:07.804
Competent.
Right?

01:08.400 --> 01:10.721
Are the Nards hurting? Yeah, you bet.
Got kicked pretty hard.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.330
Family's shattered,
supersad.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.011
But I'm kind of crushing it in
the damage-control department.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.724
So, that's cool.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.729
I wish my dad
could see me now.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.402
Of course, he caused
this whole mess, so

01:21.480 --> 01:22.686
him.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.925
Kevin, listen to me.

01:25.680 --> 01:26.966
I'm in love
with the Senator.

01:27.160 --> 01:31.085
And I need time to sort this
out in a responsible manner,

01:31.160 --> 01:33.731
so I need your help
in keeping it a secret

01:33.800 --> 01:37.282
because this means
the world to me. Okay?

01:37.840 --> 01:41.640
That's beautiful.
No, I totally get that.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.843
Can you do this,
Kevin?

01:44.440 --> 01:47.205
I really want to.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.241
Whatever happens,
always remember that.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.765
I don't know what that means.
Hey. Hey.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.450
Oh. Great.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.406
Yeah, um, I'll get
right back to you.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.447
Hey, guys, has anyone ever heard
of Iris Black on the radio?

02:01.680 --> 02:03.728
Yeah, she hosts
The Dr. Laura Show.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.405
Nope, that's Dr. Laura.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.971
Well, her show, BizWhiz,

02:07.040 --> 02:09.610
wants someone from Dunder Mifflin
to come on the air today.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.123
Does anybody feel particularly
passionate about local business issues?

02:13.360 --> 02:16.728
L do! I do!
Idolldolldol

02:17.040 --> 02:19.122
The media
can make you famous.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.244
And do you have any
idea how easy it is

02:21.320 --> 02:23.209
to sell something
when you're famous?

02:23.560 --> 02:24.561
Uh...

02:24.640 --> 02:29.202
Yeah, wow. Ten reams of 40-pound
bond at only $6.90 after discount?

02:29.280 --> 02:31.408
Uh, whatever you say,
Brad Pitt!

02:32.560 --> 02:34.130
It's that easy.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.526
Hey. So, that good-looking
single brother of yours?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.921
Heard he was in a downward
spiral with booze.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.247
Yeah, he's in rehab,
actually.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.370
Which place? The one right near Philly?
I could be there in an hour.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.240
No, it's in New Mexico.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.401
Oh.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.447
So, how are you
holding up?

02:52.520 --> 02:53.601
We're done, Meredith.

02:54.760 --> 02:55.841
Right.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.447
Greta, the tittle-tattle, prattled
on about the little metal bottle.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.289
Oh, my God. She spat a
bit of spittle on the...

03:03.360 --> 03:05.089
Dwight! ...mottled brittle
cattle in a bitter battle...

03:05.160 --> 03:06.207
Hey, hey!

03:06.280 --> 03:08.169
Stop questioning
my methods, okay?

03:08.240 --> 03:11.801
I was chosen for this task
for a very good reason.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.086
No. You chose yourself.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.329
Tricky Siskel spat
a bit of wicked biscuit.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.529
All right, guys, there's a lot of
assets here that my dad couldn't steal.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.410
Now, first of all,
there is the family boat,

03:22.600 --> 03:24.364
a 43-foot Tartan Sloop.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.882
My lawyer has lined up
a buyer in the Bahamas.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.361
The sale would cover
the cost of a condo

03:29.440 --> 03:31.283
and living
expenses for my mom.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.561
Sounds great.
Perfect.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.688
Totally, except it is
a no-go.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.406
This boat was the heart and
soul of our family, so...

03:37.480 --> 03:38.970
What else we got?
Non-boat ideas.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.770
- What happened?
- Jammed.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.361
- Can this day get worse?
- Excuse me a second.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.488
Yeah, I think
this day could get worse.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.841
You've got about 15 grand in
silverware... What does that mean?

03:47.920 --> 03:50.161
- Kevin!
- ...and napkin rings?

03:50.400 --> 03:52.562
I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.963
She could get,
like, 60 packages

03:55.040 --> 03:56.883
of ramen noodles
for five bucks.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.610
She could eat for a month.
Oh, hey. Sorry.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.569
All right, what's the grand total?
Did we make our nut?

04:00.920 --> 04:03.844
If we sell
everything but the boat,

04:03.920 --> 04:06.651
your mom should be set
for about six months.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.005
Guys, you don't understand.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.208
This boat's been in our family
since before I was born.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.366
Yeah. Don't you
guys have that place

04:14.480 --> 04:17.450
where you used to spend your summers
and have all those memories?

04:17.680 --> 04:19.011
I worked at
a Jiffy Lube.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.969
See? I bet you
wouldn't sell that Jiffy Lube

04:21.040 --> 04:22.929
for all the money in the
world, would you, Darryl?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.401
I would if I owned
it and I went broke.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.331
All right.
Uh... All right.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.528
I'm going to tell the lawyer to
pull the trigger on the boat.

04:30.120 --> 04:33.681
Yes, the boat means everything to
my family, but we need the money.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.087
Got the memories, don't need the boat.
Can't cry about it.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.361
What are you going to do?
Cry about it?

04:37.440 --> 04:38.521
Excuse me.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.011
Oh! Okay.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.890
No problem. Thanks.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.040
Hey, guys, WPTU called.
The interview's off.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.087
They're opening a new cupcake
store at the Steamtown Mall,

04:51.200 --> 04:52.929
and Iris wants
to cover that, so...

04:53.120 --> 04:54.724
Well, why don't
I go and tell Dwight

04:54.800 --> 04:57.326
so he can stop being
such a complete nipple?

04:58.240 --> 04:59.651
He's going
to be disappointed.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.371
Yes, he is.
And you know what?

05:02.880 --> 05:04.530
We cannot let that happen.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.883
Fax'?
Oh, yeah. Just...

05:15.280 --> 05:16.406
Watermelon teeth.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.246
This isn't how I would
cheer up just anyone, but

05:19.400 --> 05:22.404
it's a girlfriend's job to
know her man, and I know Andy.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.246
He is seriously juvenile.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.731
COOL.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.921
He's like 40, though, right?
Oh, no.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.811
He couldn't be more than,
like, thirties, tops.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.082
Awesome. Have fun.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.324
Dunder Mifflin.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.040
Dunder Mifflin.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.606
Good. Sounds...

05:47.680 --> 05:48.806
This is Dwight Schrute.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.325
Please hold for Ms. Black.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.924
And welcome
back to BizWhiz. I'm Iris Black.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.204
On the line we
have Dunder Mifflin's

05:58.280 --> 06:00.487
Senior Sales Associate,
Dwight Schrute.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.642
Iris, thank you so
much for having me.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.928
Help! My teeth are
all messed up in my mouth.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.206
Did you need something?

06:11.280 --> 06:13.203
Oh, I just need
your signature on this.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.041
Okay-

06:21.280 --> 06:22.486
Thanks.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.964
Kevin, we're out of 1138 forms.
Did you order more?

06:30.480 --> 06:33.006
I did not.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.485
Well, I don't know
why I'm surprised.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.927
Literally nothing you could
do could surprise me anymore.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.251
Oh, really, Angela?
That's interesting.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.247
Because I do think
that I could surprise you.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.330
I think that I could
surprise you all the...

06:47.640 --> 06:48.641
Ya!

06:49.000 --> 06:50.445
I have to go
to the bathroom!

06:50.840 --> 06:52.171
That doesn't surprise me.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.924
That actually wasn't the worst cover.
I'd say at least once a week

06:56.000 --> 06:58.526
Kevin runs out of the room shouting
that he has to go to the bathroom.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.805
So the supply forms
are going to be...

07:00.880 --> 07:02.769
I have to go
to the bathroom!

07:03.400 --> 07:05.209
I have to go to the bathroom!

07:14.640 --> 07:18.770
Okay. Who wants to go for a super-fun
lunch with a super-fun girlfriend?

07:19.120 --> 07:21.771
Look, it's not that
I don't want...

07:21.840 --> 07:23.490
Okay. Come on. I got someone
to cover the phones.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.928
I heard on the radio
about a new cupcake place

07:26.000 --> 07:28.048
we could go
for dessert. Perfect.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.566
All I ever wanted to do
was sail the damn thing.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.965
But Dad wouldn't let me.
He said,

07:34.040 --> 07:36.281
"You can't be a skipper
until you're a man."

07:37.560 --> 07:38.846
You know,
I'd reach for the wheel

07:38.920 --> 07:40.490
and he'd just
smack my hand away.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.401
Well, guess what?
Now I'm the man of the family,

07:43.720 --> 07:46.200
and we're selling
the damned thing.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.569
So I'm never going
to have the chance.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.730
Well, when does the boat
leave, exactly? Tonight.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.562
Then screw lunch. Let's go for
a sunset sail. Yeah, right.

07:56.840 --> 08:00.606
It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We'd
have to leave, like, right now.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.248
Okay, well, then let's leave,
like, right now. Yeah, okay.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.411
Yeah, okay! Let's go! Seriously?

08:06.680 --> 08:08.967
Of course, seriously.
Get your coat on.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.040
All right!
All right!

08:11.120 --> 08:12.531
Let's do it!
Let's do it!

08:15.200 --> 08:19.330
Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace
is the CEO, but he's not hands-on.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.882
So the day-to-day operations are
entirely under your command?

08:23.160 --> 08:26.642
"Entirely" is the perfect way
to describe it, Iris.

08:26.920 --> 08:30.367
Excuse me. I'm being told
by my sound engineer, Steve,

08:30.440 --> 08:33.443
that there is a clinking sound
coming from your end.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.760
Does your shirt
have buttons?

08:35.080 --> 08:36.525
Yes.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.803
I'm so sorry. We are
going to have to ask you

08:38.880 --> 08:40.644
to remove
the shirt altogether.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.289
Now, then,
we were saying.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.687
- When my workers gather...
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.360
I'm told we are still having
problems, Mr. Schrute.

08:54.840 --> 08:58.003
Your voice, it's sounding a little
feminine. That's impossible.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.841
Are you by any chance wearing
pants with a metallic zipper?

09:07.280 --> 09:10.568
The Senator is exhausted. This
campaign is wearing him out.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.367
It's a tough one. That man
he's up against is so dirty,

09:14.440 --> 09:17.489
and the Senator is just pushing
back as hard as he can.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.167
Hmm! Please stop!
What?

09:21.360 --> 09:23.931
Please stop.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.522
Anyways,
last night he was so tired,

09:26.640 --> 09:29.246
he just wanted a little Mexican brought in.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.967
I can't!
It's too much!

09:37.360 --> 09:39.124
I'm in big trouble.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.681
Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.450
Okay, how is
my voice now?

09:48.520 --> 09:50.124
I'm getting the
all-clear from Steve.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.567
So, Mr. Schrute,
what is your response

09:52.640 --> 09:54.290
to the Consumer
Product Safety Commission

09:54.440 --> 09:57.125
that says Dunder Mifflin
paper is toxic?

09:58.240 --> 09:59.890
This is gotcha journalism.
But you know what?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.200
They're not gonna gotch me.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.721
It's clearly not
an accounting mistake.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.610
Oh, Kevin.
So...

10:06.680 --> 10:08.682
His gambling problem
must have resurfaced.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.965
I'm going to have
to send him home

10:11.040 --> 10:12.769
until I can do
aninvesfigafion.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.407
Well, you gotta do
what you gotta do, so...

10:17.320 --> 10:18.765
This is slander,
Ms. Black.

10:19.040 --> 10:23.921
Slander, I say. I dare you to produce
one credible source about this.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.008
Well, as it happens,
we have with us

10:26.200 --> 10:29.443
the foreman of your Upstate New
York paper mill, Sondra Mc...

10:29.720 --> 10:30.881
Sondra Mick!

10:32.000 --> 10:33.809
Good afternoon, Iris.
It's a pleasure.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.128
I'll get straight to the point.
ls your paper toxic?

10:36.560 --> 10:37.971
No. The paper's not toxic.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.041
Thank you, Sondra!

10:39.240 --> 10:42.801
Unless it's exposed to oxygen.
Then it becomes extremely toxic.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.645
Do not listen to her! This
employee is obviously disgruntled!

10:45.720 --> 10:48.451
What the heck is going on?
The stock price is plummeting!

10:48.680 --> 10:50.330
Are you going to get
control of the message

10:50.400 --> 10:52.050
or do I have to send in someone
who understands the media?

10:52.120 --> 10:53.690
Get out of here, moron!
Okay!

10:53.760 --> 10:55.842
Excuse me, Mr. Dwight,
who are you talking to?

10:55.920 --> 10:59.083
Uh... No one. Did you just call Ms.
Mick a moron?

10:59.160 --> 11:01.731
No, everything's fine!
Are you insulting my guests?

11:04.640 --> 11:06.688
Okay, I will be
right there.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.209
Hey, Oscar, what if I'm
getting a promotion?

11:12.920 --> 11:15.048
I hope that's it, Kevin.
Me, too.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.091
'Cause then I would
get my own office.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.731
And I wouldn't screw up
your secret with Angela.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.767
I've been really
worried about that.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.964
Hi, Kevin. Look, I need
to talk to you about...

11:34.040 --> 11:35.769
Hey, guys?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.968
Excuse me. Um...
A quick word?

11:38.320 --> 11:40.766
Please, just... Oscar, we're
in the middle of talking.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.808
I know. I'm so sorry.
Snack machine, on me.

11:43.880 --> 11:47.487
Well, that is nice.
Huh. Classy move.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.806
That's what I'm saying!
No, of course not!

11:53.800 --> 11:55.040
What are you doing?

11:56.440 --> 11:57.930
Those figures I gave you?

11:58.400 --> 11:59.401
They're false.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.882
No.
I was mad at Kevin.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.362
We had a fight,
and I acted vindictively.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.208
So you set him up.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.281
Yes. He's innocent.

12:11.680 --> 12:15.162
I knew it. I knew it from the
beginning this was a possibility.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.403
What are you talking about?
I just did this now.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.481
Oh, no.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.962
A few years ago, when I was on the
jury, the Scranton Strangler?

12:22.040 --> 12:23.166
Sure.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.885
I always thought he
might have been set up,

12:24.960 --> 12:26.325
but I felt
pressured to convict.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.971
Well, that's
got to be tough.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.726
Tough? I put an innocent
man on death row.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.320
The fallout from this morning's
revelation continues to mount.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.647
Since Mr. Dwight
Schrute began speaking,

12:36.920 --> 12:39.924
Dunder Mifflin
share prices fell 73%.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.088
Mr. Schrute,
shareholders demand

12:42.160 --> 12:44.049
accountability from
corporate leadership.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.329
Can we announce your
resignation at this time?

12:46.400 --> 12:49.449
My resignation? What are you talking about?
No! I'm just following orders!

12:49.560 --> 12:52.040
Listen, the person responsible
for this catastrophe

12:52.160 --> 12:54.845
is the CEO and Chairman,
David Wallace!

12:56.680 --> 12:58.489
That's yours? ANDY: That's
the family boat, right there.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.050
0h, my gosh, Andy!

13:00.680 --> 13:02.205
This is enormous!
Right?

13:02.280 --> 13:06.080
I thought it was going to be tiny!
Oh, my gosh, it's beautiful.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.727
So this is how your
family came to America.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.882
Move.
Sorry?

13:12.280 --> 13:13.964
I'm trying to rig a boat here.
I don't know how to do that

13:14.040 --> 13:15.201
when you're
standing in the way.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.328
Sure. I'm not...
I didn't know...

13:17.440 --> 13:20.171
I'm not a ghost, so I can't
walk through people.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.843
Okay?
Okay! He was salty.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.684
He is, a little bit.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.329
How you doing, old buddy?
Missed you.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.680
What does that one do?

13:28.800 --> 13:30.040
This raises the mainsail.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.765
That was my job
when we went sailing.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.046
I wish I had seen you do it.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.085
Really?
Yeah!

13:36.760 --> 13:39.331
Up she goes!
Don't do that.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.005
Don't do that.
Oh, it's okay.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.411
My girlfriend and I
were actually gonna

13:43.560 --> 13:44.891
take her for
a little spin and a picnic

13:44.960 --> 13:46.121
before you guys
head out tonight.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.083
You know what? Get some dinner, on me...
No. Nope.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.130
Can't do that.
Got it.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.803
You know what?
Then we'll just take it

13:52.880 --> 13:54.644
for a quick little
spin around the harbor.

13:55.760 --> 13:56.966
We've already
started boarding.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.441
No one's insured to rig or
operate now, except us.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.364
You know what?
Chill, okay?

14:01.640 --> 14:04.325
I own the boat.
I'm not going to sue myself.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.931
All right? So just...

14:07.320 --> 14:09.209
Wow! I can smack you all
day if you keep touching

14:09.280 --> 14:10.611
what you're not
supposed to touch.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.645
Okay, fine.
Okay?

14:13.760 --> 14:15.046
Yeah. Fine.
Good stuff.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.884
Good stuff! Great stuff.
Great.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.727
Damn it!
Screw you, Dad!

14:22.960 --> 14:23.961
Huh.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.689
Well, we're doing it. We're finally
having a picnic on the boat!

14:31.400 --> 14:33.926
I've had a thousand
picnics on this boat.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.331
The point was
for me to sail it.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.964
Andy, you never had to
sail the boat to be a man.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.564
Fine, but I could have.

14:43.960 --> 14:47.965
As long as we're on this boat, as far
as I'm concerned, you're the captain.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.247
I am the captain.
Yeah.

14:50.480 --> 14:51.766
Right?
Yeah!

14:54.400 --> 14:55.970
I'm the captain.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.765
Hey, Charm School!
What?

15:03.280 --> 15:05.806
I'm taking over from here.
Nice!

15:07.120 --> 15:10.408
Okay, I hate to ruin
this moment, or breakdown,

15:10.480 --> 15:13.086
but you already signed the papers.
So if you want your boat back,

15:13.160 --> 15:15.481
you can pick it up there
in the Bahamas in 10 days.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.887
Yeah, I know, because I'm
sailing it there. Okay, no.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.361
I already said, you're not
getting back your deposit.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.851
Fine. Keep it.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.241
Just leave the supplies,
I already paid for those.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.328
How much for that
cool fisherman's sweater?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.571
For those just joining us,
terror in Greenwich,

15:32.800 --> 15:34.564
where the police have
surrounded the house

15:34.640 --> 15:36.881
of Dunder Mifflin
CEO David Wallace.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.048
Wallace is said
to be despondent

15:39.200 --> 15:41.168
over the company's stock
plummet,

15:41.320 --> 15:43.209
and has taken
a mailman hostage.

15:43.480 --> 15:47.280
On the line we have
Chief of Greenwich Police

15:47.720 --> 15:51.202
Mr. Bill Jackson. Good afternoon.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.811
Please, sir,
spare him!

15:53.960 --> 15:54.961
Please!

15:55.040 --> 15:57.771
Uh, this Wallace guy's
looking at hard time,

15:57.960 --> 15:59.530
and we only know
this because of

15:59.600 --> 16:01.409
what Dwight
Snoot said on record.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.564
Okay, everyone! Everyone hold on!
I've got a solution.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.006
I know Wallace's phone number!
Everyone hold, I'll conference him in!

16:08.320 --> 16:11.164
Oh, no, Mr. Schrute, there's really
no need to, um, involve Mr. Wallace.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.881
Do you even know what you're doing?
Yeah.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.010
Yeah, I know how to hoist the mainsail.
I know how to...

16:18.120 --> 16:22.250
These buttons control
the bilge pumps and stuff.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.369
I also know where
the booze stash is. Hello!

16:27.080 --> 16:28.206
Walt?

16:29.240 --> 16:31.686
Oh, God! Thank
goodness you're here.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.247
I was having
a little trouble

16:34.440 --> 16:37.410
with this door, uh, yesterday.
I, uh...

16:39.560 --> 16:41.050
I think it was yesterday.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.566
I thought you were in rehab.

16:42.720 --> 16:46.566
Yeah, I just, uh... I figured I'd get
that first relapse out of the way.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.961
God, what's happened to our family?
Everything is so messed up.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.286
How did you even know I was in here?
I didn't.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.482
I just came to say
goodbye to the boat,

16:57.240 --> 16:58.924
but I've decided
to sail it to Bermuda.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.445
Bahamas, Andy.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.646
Same thing.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.321
I need a crew.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.126
You should be my crew!

17:05.560 --> 17:08.325
Three weeks, open ocean, no booze.
You need this.

17:08.480 --> 17:12.040
- I need it. We need this. Serious bro time.
- Come on.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.130
Hello?
David, is that you?

17:14.319 --> 17:16.721
Dwight? Oh, thank God!
Oh, thank God!

17:16.800 --> 17:18.450
Are you okay?
ls everyone okay?

17:18.560 --> 17:20.881
Yeah. Are you okay?
I'm okay.

17:21.119 --> 17:24.521
I just want you to know
that I believe in you.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.642
I really do, and I believe in your
ability to make the right choices.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.323
- I always have, David.
- Well, thanks, Dwight.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.845
You're welcome, sir.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.887
But David,
listen to me carefully.

17:38.160 --> 17:42.006
I'm going to need you
to let the mailman go, okay?

17:42.240 --> 17:43.924
Walk out of the house...
What?

17:44.040 --> 17:45.690
...with your hands
on top of your head.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.649
Everything is
going to be fine.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.209
Dunder Mifflin will be in good
hands while you're away in prison.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.245
Okay. Dwight?
I'm going to ask you

17:53.320 --> 17:55.641
to not call me on my
cell anymore. Gotta go.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.931
Wait a minute.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.962
You guys? You heard?

18:05.520 --> 18:07.522
Schrute! Schrute!
Schrute! Schrute!

18:07.640 --> 18:10.086
Sch rute! Sch rute!
Sch rute! Sch rute!

18:10.160 --> 18:11.207
Sch rute! Sch rute!

18:11.400 --> 18:13.448
Overall, I'd say my
first radio interview

18:13.520 --> 18:15.090
went pretty much
the way I expected.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.923
Well, Oscar, I did not
get the promotion.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.526
He just wanted to update
my personal information.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.370
Well, I'm sorry, Kevin.

18:25.640 --> 18:28.405
Why on Earth would you think
you were getting a promotion?

18:28.560 --> 18:30.210
You know what,
Angela? I...

18:30.280 --> 18:32.408
Oh, my God!

18:32.520 --> 18:34.648
Honey!
What are you doing here?

18:34.720 --> 18:36.290
Oh, I just had
an intuition

18:36.360 --> 18:39.409
that someone I love needed a
little of my attention today.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.129
Oscar!
Looking very healthy.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.649
Getting lots
of vigorous exercise?

18:44.720 --> 18:46.882
Oh, no.

18:47.720 --> 18:51.805
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?

18:51.880 --> 18:53.962
What was that? I'm sorry. I
didn't mean any offense.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.121
I was just
trying to be friendly.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.486
You know what?
I'm sorry.

18:56.680 --> 18:59.524
I overreacted
because I'm stressed out.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.289
Why am I stressed out?
Who's not stressed out?

19:02.560 --> 19:04.403
Who's not stressed out?
Come on, Oscar.

19:04.920 --> 19:08.129
We're not just going to sit
here and ignore the obvious.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.763
Senator Lipton has a big
election next week.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.248
We all need to
give him our support!

19:16.240 --> 19:19.164
Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks, everybody.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.171
This is really cool.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.603
USA! USA!

19:27.400 --> 19:30.404
I have to say, I'm impressed
with Kevin. Uh...

19:32.120 --> 19:34.487
He showed a lot
of self-control.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.084
I totally forgot about
the affair for a minute.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.761
Oscar is having
sex with the Senator

19:44.840 --> 19:47.525
and Angela
doesn't even know.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.924
Her life is a complete sham!

19:55.400 --> 19:58.210
All right, guys, cast us off.
Walt! All aboard!

19:58.600 --> 20:03.288
Erin, this is because of you. Do you
realize that? You're the best ever!

20:03.840 --> 20:05.968
Oh, you know,
just being a good girlfriend.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.964
Good? Come on!
Above and beyond!

20:09.040 --> 20:11.805
World's greatest!
You did this!

20:13.440 --> 20:14.566
Damn it, I'm haPPY!

20:14.640 --> 20:17.405
Yes, lam very
pleased I could help Andy.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.926
Would I have gone
with him if he'd asked me?

20:20.080 --> 20:23.323
On his sailboat cruise
to the Caribbean? Yes.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.245
I think that would have been
really fun and romantic.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.011
I'll see you in three weeks!
Okay!

20:28.120 --> 20:30.930
Hey, bro! It was here all along!
No way!

20:31.040 --> 20:32.166
Way!

20:32.840 --> 20:36.481
Erin, I gotta go!
Them's my chords!

20:43.480 --> 20:45.767
Hey! She's back.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.288
Thanks for covering the phones.
Yeah, no problem.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.771
How was it?
Fine.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.923
Hey, some buddies and I
are going to Poor Richard's

20:58.000 --> 20:59.411
for beers and pool.
You want to come?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.764
I can't promise
you too much, but

21:01.840 --> 21:03.888
you might get to meet
my friend Flipper.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.565
Does he have a flipper?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.844
Oh. Nope. It's not that.
He, uh...

21:09.520 --> 21:11.921
He flipped a table one time
when he was drunk.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.845
He sounds like an idiot.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.131
Yeah, he is.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.126
Okay-

21:19.880 --> 21:20.881
