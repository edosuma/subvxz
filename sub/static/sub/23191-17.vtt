00:45.628 --> 00:46.979
_

00:58.034 --> 01:00.883
I will do immediately. Thank you.

01:01.758 --> 01:04.275
Crabtree! In here.

01:05.622 --> 01:08.372
- Sirs.
- Pack up your desk.

01:08.573 --> 01:10.707
- Excuse me?
- And buy a suit.

01:10.956 --> 01:13.050
Davis at Station House Number Three

01:13.170 --> 01:14.736
wants you as his detective.

01:14.856 --> 01:18.167
- You start in two weeks.
- Sir, truly?

01:18.340 --> 01:20.266
Detective Crabtree.

01:20.447 --> 01:21.877
Congratulations.

01:21.997 --> 01:24.228
"Detective Crabtree" I
like the sound of that!

01:24.293 --> 01:26.651
No time to celebrate, we've
got to get to the polls.

01:26.857 --> 01:27.959
Margaret's waiting.

01:27.978 --> 01:30.704
Oh, sir, I already voted
in the advance polls,

01:30.768 --> 01:34.215
in case I was detained on an investigation.

01:40.322 --> 01:42.517
That's what advance polls are for.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.165
Come along, the polling station's this way.

01:52.354 --> 01:55.189
Good day, Dr. Nesbitt. Mr. Marter.

01:55.309 --> 01:58.490
Dr. Ogden, whatever are
you ladies doing here?

01:58.507 --> 02:00.408
The same as you, gentlemen.

02:00.442 --> 02:02.139
Not quite the same thing.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.725
We are here to cast our
own votes, after all.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.213
I hear it's to be a tight race today.

02:07.439 --> 02:09.806
Yes, between Mr. Marter and I.

02:09.925 --> 02:11.772
May the best man win.

02:21.887 --> 02:23.562
The line is back here.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.765
Why wait in line when you can be first in?

02:25.799 --> 02:27.630
They'll get their turn soon enough.

02:29.023 --> 02:31.037
Voting is open!

02:36.110 --> 02:38.769
- Shall we?
- We've a busy day ahead.

02:38.809 --> 02:40.928
Busier than we expected. As of last night,

02:40.968 --> 02:43.485
we have 26 committed
voters for Margaret Haile.

02:43.526 --> 02:45.795
26 men in support of women's suffrage!

02:45.915 --> 02:49.326
And no matter how many votes we get,
we're showing other women it can be done.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.191
So, although

02:52.226 --> 02:54.861
- Mr. Marter is the incumbent...
- And the Conservative.

02:55.099 --> 02:56.352
Didn't I vote for him last time?

02:56.383 --> 02:59.460
No, he's since left the Conservatives
and is running as an Independent.

02:59.718 --> 03:01.913
Independent. I quite
like the sound of that.

03:02.490 --> 03:05.134
Perhaps he had enough of
back-room party shenanigans.

03:05.254 --> 03:06.346
Don't be silly, Thomas,

03:06.392 --> 03:08.809
he's pouting because he didn't
get a Senate appointment.

03:09.208 --> 03:11.871
On the other hand, the
new Conservative candidate,

03:11.876 --> 03:13.958
Dr. Nesbitt, is a scoundrel!

03:14.025 --> 03:16.025
Well, that just leaves the lady candidate.

03:16.076 --> 03:17.870
Doctor Ogden will be chuffed.

03:17.990 --> 03:21.334
Any woman who manages her life
right doesn't need suffrage.

03:21.519 --> 03:23.127
I'm perfectly happy to leave

03:23.156 --> 03:25.158
the whole dirty business to my husband.

03:25.524 --> 03:28.452
I've decided to support Doctors
Ogden and Grace in their cause.

03:28.777 --> 03:30.736
A wasted vote, in my books.

03:30.856 --> 03:32.764
We're voting for the party as usual.

03:32.798 --> 03:36.076
Isn't that right, Thomas?

03:36.772 --> 03:38.269
Wait there, Margaret.

03:42.262 --> 03:44.979
- Excuse me!
- Toronto Constabulary.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.103
The Detective had the right idea, sir.

03:55.395 --> 03:57.077
Voting will have to wait.

04:00.218 --> 04:02.856
Constabulary, move aside please.

04:05.312 --> 04:08.022
I heard George is moving up in the ranks.

04:08.056 --> 04:09.732
Why, yes.

04:10.587 --> 04:12.127
Detective Crabtree,

04:12.157 --> 04:14.728
would you care to assess
the scene of the crime?

04:15.762 --> 04:17.634
I would indeed, sir.

04:21.201 --> 04:23.037
How very odd!

04:23.256 --> 04:25.995
Yes, it appears our victim
is wearing a fake moustache.

04:26.373 --> 04:28.578
Dr. Ogden and I saw two men entering

04:28.591 --> 04:30.704
the polling station wearing red ties.

04:31.045 --> 04:33.816
I can't be sure of his
face, but I remember the tie.

04:34.538 --> 04:37.450
He's still warm despite the morning chill.

04:37.717 --> 04:39.985
Could very well be one of the men you saw.

04:40.337 --> 04:42.695
He was strangled it would seem,

04:43.223 --> 04:45.324
and with no small amount of force.

04:45.923 --> 04:48.339
His name is Plantagenet McCarthy.

04:48.758 --> 04:49.801
Alright then, Detective,

04:49.801 --> 04:52.558
how do you think the investigation
should proceed from here?

04:52.678 --> 04:56.134
Well, sir, as we already have Constables
interviewing witnesses in the area,

04:56.169 --> 04:58.048
I would dispatch another Constable,

04:58.168 --> 04:59.285
in this case, myself...

04:59.305 --> 05:02.390
to dig into background information
for our victim, Mr. McCarthy.

05:02.583 --> 05:04.021
And as the Detective...

05:04.141 --> 05:05.877
in this case, you, sir...

05:05.997 --> 05:08.453
I would probably proceed to the
victim's last known whereabouts.

05:09.014 --> 05:10.615
Sounds about right.

05:11.084 --> 05:13.249
- Indeed.
- Off we go.

05:13.553 --> 05:15.053
Thank you, Dr. Grace.

05:17.496 --> 05:18.671
Good morning, Margaret.

05:18.681 --> 05:21.208
It's a fine day to make history, Lillian.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.761
Margaret, I don't know what happened.

05:23.796 --> 05:26.738
One of our supporters just told me
that your name isn't on the ballot!

05:26.799 --> 05:29.548
- How can that be?
- I'll telephone Clara Brett Martin.

05:29.569 --> 05:32.053
Get word to our supporters
at other polling stations.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.177
lt's not in my power to stop voting.

05:35.256 --> 05:38.130
I assure you, Margaret Haile is
a properly registered candidate.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.692
- If her name isn't on the ballot...
- It's not on the ballot.

05:40.955 --> 05:42.599
Then none of these votes are valid.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.805
You'll need to take your
complaint up with Mr. Snipe,

05:45.852 --> 05:48.652
- our Returning Officer.
- Can I help you, ladies?

05:49.115 --> 05:50.787
I certainly hope so.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.659
Mr. Snipe, we have no intention of leaving!

05:55.693 --> 05:57.961
Then I will be forced to call the police.

05:58.918 --> 06:01.880
Detective Murdoch, Toronto
Constabulary. May I help you?

06:02.200 --> 06:03.979
Take your hands off the ladies, sir.

06:04.535 --> 06:06.603
Margaret Haile has been
left off the ballots.

06:06.618 --> 06:09.366
- Yet men continue to vote.
- I am the returning officer

06:09.386 --> 06:11.589
and I am not prepared to stop the vote.

06:11.709 --> 06:14.358
If the ballots are incorrect,
sir, is it not your fault?

06:15.401 --> 06:16.495
No...

06:18.319 --> 06:19.814
Let me see what I can do, sir.

06:19.865 --> 06:23.004
On another matter, we need the list of
all the men who voted in the last hour,

06:23.200 --> 06:24.754
as well as the names of your staff.

06:25.030 --> 06:27.154
You will need to talk to my clerks.

06:29.819 --> 06:32.070
Do you recall seeing two men

06:32.190 --> 06:34.901
wearing red ties? They came in together.

06:35.447 --> 06:36.632
Uh, yes,

06:36.668 --> 06:39.534
yes I do. They were the
first and second to vote.

06:40.070 --> 06:41.545
Alexander Cuddy

06:41.571 --> 06:44.313
and Plantagenet McCarthy.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.489
Will that be all, sir?

06:53.849 --> 06:55.849
Yes, thank you.

06:56.710 --> 06:59.735
It appears our victim's
friend was one Alexander Cuddy

06:59.782 --> 07:02.391
- of 18 Suffolk Street.
- I'll have him brought in.

07:02.511 --> 07:05.225
You get over to McCarthy's
place, see what you can find.

07:06.771 --> 07:08.797
That's wonderful news, Georg!

07:09.348 --> 07:11.632
You've wanted this for so long.

07:11.647 --> 07:13.477
I was starting to think
it would never happen.

07:13.812 --> 07:16.871
I can't believe I'll be
out of this uniform forever.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.786
Can you imagine me going off
to work in a nice dapper suit?

07:20.076 --> 07:21.327
And just think of it, I mean,

07:21.447 --> 07:23.429
you'll be the one solving the crimes

07:23.549 --> 07:26.426
and catching the murderers and
making sure families see justice!

07:26.546 --> 07:28.023
It's all on your shoulders.

07:28.503 --> 07:30.765
Now that you mention it,
I hope I'm up to the task.

07:30.781 --> 07:31.812
Well of course you are,

07:32.003 --> 07:33.296
with your experience and smarts!

07:33.317 --> 07:36.137
What if I'm not as capable
without Detective Murdoch's help?

07:36.257 --> 07:38.508
Put that thought out of your
head, George. You'll be fine.

07:38.734 --> 07:41.204
And besides, you'll have
a Crabtree of your own.

07:48.336 --> 07:49.445
Edna...

07:50.295 --> 07:51.419
I have to get back.

07:51.801 --> 07:54.434
Well, meet me for lunch. I'll
take you out to celebrate.

07:54.445 --> 07:55.599
I'd love that.

08:00.836 --> 08:04.031
- Clara, thank God you're here.
- Julia, Margaret. What a disappointment!

08:04.151 --> 08:05.841
What do the election laws say about this?

08:05.877 --> 08:07.537
They don't seem to
account for such a mistake.

08:07.568 --> 08:10.268
- It's never happened before.
- Not the history we wanted to make.

08:10.273 --> 08:12.283
Here's the Returning
Officer now. Mr. Snipe,

08:12.329 --> 08:15.294
this is Clara Brett
Martin, Miss Haile's lawyer.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.197
Mr. Snipe, I assure you all of Miss
Haile's candidacy papers are in order,

08:19.228 --> 08:21.553
and as such she has every
right to appear on the ballot.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.630
That may be,

08:22.841 --> 08:26.197
but I won't disrupt the voting
for the sake of a stunt candidate.

08:26.604 --> 08:30.755
If you can't make this right, I will
petition a judge to order an injunction.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.479
You can try what you like.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.669
Miss Haile was never going to win,

08:34.669 --> 08:37.083
so I very much doubt
that this particular error

08:37.100 --> 08:38.840
makes any real difference either way.

08:39.453 --> 08:40.344
Good day, ladies.

08:40.596 --> 08:43.960
An injunction it is. I'll
be back as quickly as I can.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.321
If our supporters can't vote,

08:47.354 --> 08:48.591
then no one should.

08:49.766 --> 08:51.824
What do you have in mind, Julia?

09:37.020 --> 09:39.376
Oh, William...

09:43.448 --> 09:45.538
Murdoch.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.538
Murdoch!

09:49.474 --> 09:51.578
Hey!

09:53.349 --> 09:55.494
Terrence Meyers!

10:01.353 --> 10:03.437
What are you doing here, Meyers?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.390
The much more compelling question is

10:05.404 --> 10:07.260
what are you doing here, Murdoch?

10:07.640 --> 10:11.024
I'm investigating the death
of one Plantagenet McCarthy.

10:12.163 --> 10:15.243
- Plantagenet McCarthy is dead?
- Yes.

10:15.246 --> 10:17.256
We found his body this morning.

10:18.854 --> 10:20.650
This was on his person.

10:21.643 --> 10:23.395
What kind of gas was that?

10:23.515 --> 10:26.224
It's harmless... or so I've been told.

10:30.347 --> 10:32.950
Why did you booby-trap
McCarthy's apartment?

10:35.005 --> 10:38.333
Murdoch, McCarthy was a
spy... one of my operatives,

10:38.384 --> 10:41.554
- on a very important mission.
- Of course he was.

10:42.121 --> 10:43.951
I want to see the body.

10:45.021 --> 10:48.185
He was strangled with a cord
about a quarter-inch in diameter.

10:48.223 --> 10:51.129
I believe the killer used
a sisal twine dyed green.

10:51.381 --> 10:53.250
I retrieved fibres from the wound.

10:53.285 --> 10:54.409
You can take a look.

10:56.090 --> 10:59.177
- Where would I find his personal effects, Doctor?
- Right over there.

10:59.512 --> 11:00.991
Detective, if that will be all?

11:01.299 --> 11:02.789
Yes, thank you.

11:04.943 --> 11:06.174
What's this, Murdoch?

11:08.581 --> 11:10.333
He was wearing a false moustache.

11:10.767 --> 11:11.576
Huh!

11:12.051 --> 11:13.380
A bit of spycraft.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.539
- Hmm.
- This is an unfortunate turn of events.

11:16.899 --> 11:19.742
I personally recruited McCarthy
out of McGill University.

11:20.477 --> 11:21.744
Trained him myself.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.547
Perhaps that would explain his fate.

11:27.178 --> 11:29.358
I need you to help me find his killer.

11:29.820 --> 11:30.899
Ah, yes.

11:31.136 --> 11:34.131
- I imagine it's a matter of national...
- ... National security.

11:38.156 --> 11:41.346
McCarthy's latest mission
was to flush out a German spy

11:41.351 --> 11:42.723
operating in Toronto.

11:43.068 --> 11:44.212
His death,

11:44.377 --> 11:45.557
while regrettable,

11:45.609 --> 11:47.552
proves the enemy spy is close.

11:47.672 --> 11:49.809
Why would a German spy be in Toronto?

11:50.583 --> 11:52.273
The Germans are extremely interested

11:52.299 --> 11:54.968
in anyone capable of supplying
arms to Great Britain.

11:55.565 --> 11:57.264
So your spy tasked with

11:57.273 --> 11:59.914
monitoring international
movement of munitions

11:59.973 --> 12:02.884
found time to vote in
our election this morning?

12:03.461 --> 12:06.471
Spies fulfill their civic
duty as well as everyone else.

12:06.904 --> 12:08.710
We're gonna need a list
of everyone that was

12:08.710 --> 12:11.543
- at that polling station when McCarthy was there.
- Already done.

12:12.821 --> 12:13.753
Excellent.

12:14.384 --> 12:15.687
I'm glad you've taken my advice

12:15.724 --> 12:17.794
on intelligence-gathering
seriously, Murdoch.

12:24.305 --> 12:27.868
- Emily! Come here.
- Oh, how exciting!

12:28.025 --> 12:30.540
- What are we doing exactly?
- Now see here, Dr. Ogden,

12:30.545 --> 12:32.874
I've done my best to tolerate your crusade.

12:32.898 --> 12:34.936
That's very considerate of you, Mr. Marter.

12:35.056 --> 12:37.970
I think it's time for you ladies
to go back to your knitting.

12:38.407 --> 12:41.891
Tell me, Dr. Nesbitt, what would you do
if it were your name left off the ballot?

12:42.011 --> 12:44.873
My dear, my name could
never be left off the ballot.

12:45.252 --> 12:47.240
I have the power of the party behind me.

12:47.240 --> 12:50.926
You have all the power, Dr. Nesbitt.
And that is precisely the problem.

12:50.943 --> 12:52.909
- Bravo!
- Well said!

12:53.264 --> 12:55.879
Um, what are you all doing?

12:56.064 --> 12:57.190
We're protesting.

12:57.578 --> 12:59.412
- Why?
- This lady here,

12:59.420 --> 13:00.633
- Margaret Haile...
- Hello.

13:00.653 --> 13:01.222
Hello.

13:01.292 --> 13:02.575
... is running for office,

13:02.620 --> 13:04.327
but they left her name off the ballot.

13:04.529 --> 13:05.846
That sounds unfair.

13:08.468 --> 13:09.739
I'm sorry, not today.

13:09.859 --> 13:11.285
But thank you very much, young lady.

13:11.405 --> 13:13.285
You're exactly why all of this matters.

13:14.117 --> 13:16.142
Germans? Connected to our victim?

13:16.556 --> 13:18.529
Murdoch and I are just
about to match your list

13:18.566 --> 13:21.926
of voters with the profile I
have on one Wolfgang Ketzer,

13:21.962 --> 13:22.990
a German spy

13:23.225 --> 13:24.978
known to be operating in Toronto.

13:25.233 --> 13:27.624
And you believe this Ketzer
was at the polling station.

13:28.201 --> 13:29.232
Care to share why?

13:30.576 --> 13:32.319
Because my man, McCarthy, is dead.

13:32.358 --> 13:33.982
Obviously killed by this conniving Hun.

13:34.003 --> 13:35.149
You don't know that.

13:35.685 --> 13:38.535
For all we know, Alexander
Cuddy could be our man.

13:38.927 --> 13:41.257
He and McCarthy were
seen together at the polls

13:41.277 --> 13:42.862
shortly before McCarthy's death.

13:42.982 --> 13:45.097
And they were both
wearing matching red ties.

13:45.388 --> 13:46.774
Cuddy is not our man.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.013
- You seem very sure of that.
- I'm very certain.

13:49.455 --> 13:51.158
Care to share why, Mr. Meyers?

13:53.046 --> 13:55.503
Gentlemen. I am at
liberty to share with you

13:55.520 --> 13:58.245
the information I have on Ketzer: mid-40s,

13:58.274 --> 13:59.704
stands over six feet tall.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.659
Beautiful day, lads.

14:03.060 --> 14:04.083
What have you, George?

14:04.203 --> 14:05.254
Ah, sir.

14:05.675 --> 14:07.185
Plantagenet McCarthy.

14:07.460 --> 14:10.594
He studied both French and
German at McGill University,

14:10.729 --> 14:13.625
lived there in Montreal for some
time, as well as Quebec City.

14:14.273 --> 14:16.405
Both cities with munitions factories.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.416
Also, sir, somebody once tried
to kill him but he survived.

14:19.865 --> 14:21.596
- Indeed?
- About 20 years ago.

14:21.621 --> 14:23.720
It sounds like he's led quite
an adventurous life, sir.

14:25.123 --> 14:26.919
Ah! Oh, good.

14:26.989 --> 14:29.321
Potential suspects from the
polling station have arrived.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.432
Thank you, George.

14:31.410 --> 14:32.606
No...

14:33.266 --> 14:34.145
No...

14:35.245 --> 14:36.643
Certainly not.

14:37.954 --> 14:39.002
No...

14:40.313 --> 14:41.443
Perhaps...

14:46.076 --> 14:46.898
This one.

14:48.939 --> 14:50.213
Sir, what is your name?

14:50.687 --> 14:51.802
John Smith.

14:52.237 --> 14:53.788
Ah. Mr. Smith...

14:54.946 --> 14:57.053
We've detained you to ask you

14:57.087 --> 15:01.051
about your recent visit to
Polling Station Number Five.

15:02.329 --> 15:04.909
Did you speak to any other voters there?

15:06.461 --> 15:07.442
"Good morning,"

15:07.764 --> 15:09.879
"Nice day for it," that sort of thing.

15:10.328 --> 15:11.767
I voted and left.

15:22.133 --> 15:23.209
"John Smith"

15:23.226 --> 15:24.739
is not your real name, is it?

15:24.859 --> 15:25.526
No.

15:25.897 --> 15:27.633
It's Johannes Schmidt,

15:28.226 --> 15:30.977
but Canadians can't pronounce
that, so I changed it.

15:32.003 --> 15:33.014
Murdoch,

15:33.088 --> 15:36.037
I will be taking this man into the
custody of the Canadian government.

15:36.404 --> 15:38.989
We apparently have some catching
up to do, don't we "Schmidt"?

15:39.109 --> 15:40.100
All right.

15:41.396 --> 15:42.687
Mr. Schmidt,

15:43.251 --> 15:44.855
may I see your hands?

15:48.294 --> 15:49.325
Thank you.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.812
Considering the weapon

15:51.932 --> 15:53.952
and the force required to strangle someone,

15:53.964 --> 15:56.854
I would expect to see some
marks on the killer's hands.

15:57.179 --> 15:59.620
Any spy worth his salt would wear gloves

15:59.654 --> 16:01.043
when executing a man.

16:01.163 --> 16:04.473
Any spy worth his salt wouldn't
speak German and expose himself.

16:05.053 --> 16:08.276
He exposed himself
precisely to hide himself.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.888
Some things you have
yet to learn, Inspector.

16:15.388 --> 16:17.577
That poor bugger's
neither a killer nor a spy.

16:17.639 --> 16:18.818
I agree.

16:19.693 --> 16:21.268
So let's find the real one.

16:23.252 --> 16:25.470
I hope you weren't
expecting something fancier.

16:25.590 --> 16:26.921
I think it's perfect.

16:27.503 --> 16:30.038
Nothing could be more perfect
than this moment right now.

16:30.945 --> 16:32.438
And on a Detective's salary,

16:32.463 --> 16:35.667
- I'll be able to afford fancier places.
- Mm, fancier hot dogs.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.399
Oh, the fanciest hot dogs.

16:37.832 --> 16:39.407
But I could afford to buy a house.

16:40.372 --> 16:41.799
I could afford to get married.

16:42.009 --> 16:43.662
Is that meant to be a proposal, George?

16:44.258 --> 16:45.625
Well, it wouldn't be...

16:47.414 --> 16:49.133
I was just kidding. I didn't...

16:49.360 --> 16:51.714
I didn't mean you'd actually...

16:57.971 --> 16:58.728
George?

17:00.306 --> 17:01.210
Edna...

17:04.347 --> 17:06.842
Will you do me the honour
of becoming my wife?

17:09.137 --> 17:10.078
Yes.

17:11.645 --> 17:12.779
Yes, I will.

17:27.204 --> 17:29.657
Gentlemen, it is your right to vote!

17:29.814 --> 17:32.565
Do not let those who
do not share that right

17:32.594 --> 17:34.619
deprive you of yours.

17:34.957 --> 17:36.949
Sir, you will not pass.

17:37.643 --> 17:39.963
This is exactly the farcical nonsense

17:39.983 --> 17:42.495
that we would expect
from women in politics!

17:42.615 --> 17:44.404
If our legitimate voters can't be counted,

17:44.424 --> 17:46.522
the results of this entire
riding will be invalid.

17:46.526 --> 17:48.737
- Our point precisely.
- We are as eager to find

17:48.787 --> 17:50.774
a solution as you are. In
the meantime, if you continue

17:50.789 --> 17:52.097
to incite this crowd,

17:52.180 --> 17:54.270
the consequences will be on your hands.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.329
- Move aside!
- Stand back, sir.

17:56.341 --> 17:57.308
I want my vote.

17:58.168 --> 18:00.783
Didn't I see you here this
morning? You've already voted!

18:01.719 --> 18:05.063
Constable! This man is
attempting to vote illegally.

18:07.507 --> 18:08.905
Well done, Emily.

18:10.988 --> 18:11.975
Red tie.

18:12.010 --> 18:14.427
Constable, take this man to
Detective Murdoch immediately.

18:17.820 --> 18:19.349
Alexander Cuddy,

18:20.207 --> 18:21.906
Matin Rapovski

18:22.941 --> 18:24.335
and Roger Gaskin.

18:25.456 --> 18:26.928
Which of these is your real name?

18:27.555 --> 18:28.961
Alexander Cuddy.

18:29.711 --> 18:31.778
Alexander Cuddy. Well, then, Mr. Cuddy,

18:32.083 --> 18:33.352
you are a plugger.

18:33.913 --> 18:37.595
You assume the identities of
legitimate registered voters,

18:37.601 --> 18:40.436
you cast their vote for the
candidate of your choosing.

18:41.892 --> 18:43.472
You will be charged with fraud,

18:43.871 --> 18:45.566
and that may not be the extent of it.

18:45.619 --> 18:46.522
What do you mean?

18:46.914 --> 18:50.026
Where and when did you last
see Plantagenet McCarthy?

18:50.522 --> 18:51.226
Who?

18:52.558 --> 18:54.591
Your friend, Plantagenet McCarthy.

18:56.241 --> 18:58.212
Oh, right. We went to the polls together,

18:58.221 --> 19:00.295
then we went our separate
ways. You caught him, too?

19:01.676 --> 19:02.971
Mr. McCarthy

19:03.292 --> 19:05.366
was found dead this morning,

19:05.902 --> 19:07.890
right around the corner
from the polling station.

19:08.010 --> 19:09.143
That's terrible!

19:09.431 --> 19:11.380
Did you have any reason to argue

19:11.386 --> 19:14.334
- with Mr. McCarthy yourself?
- No, no, We were friends.

19:15.031 --> 19:16.108
Who would want to kill Burt?

19:16.405 --> 19:17.215
Burt?

19:20.349 --> 19:21.314
Burt Larsen.

19:21.648 --> 19:23.973
Bloody Meyers! He lied to us again.

19:24.006 --> 19:26.204
We should have expected as much.

19:30.018 --> 19:32.287
So the victim, this Burt Larsen,

19:32.893 --> 19:35.436
was a plugger who used
a spy's name by mistake

19:35.462 --> 19:38.211
and got "plugged" for
it. Bit unfortunate, that.

19:38.570 --> 19:40.681
Sir, he was strangled, not shot.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.121
Yes, Murdoch. I know. It was a joke.

19:45.723 --> 19:47.367
One suit in the wardrobe.

19:48.419 --> 19:49.475
One shirt.

19:50.324 --> 19:52.377
Seems like a typical bachelor's flat.

19:53.077 --> 19:54.801
What exactly are we looking for?

19:54.970 --> 19:58.812
Some sort of clue as to the
real Plantagenet McCarthy.

19:59.534 --> 20:01.387
Why don't we just ask Meyers?

20:02.751 --> 20:03.857
Oh, right.

20:05.614 --> 20:07.115
A pipe that's never been used.

20:07.993 --> 20:09.514
No bed sheets.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.392
Sir...

20:13.695 --> 20:16.495
Meyers has sent us on a fool's errand.

20:18.033 --> 20:19.632
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

20:19.827 --> 20:21.996
Plantagenet McCarthy doesn't exist.

20:26.201 --> 20:27.586
Stop the vote!

20:30.559 --> 20:31.462
Stop the vote!

20:32.159 --> 20:34.815
I have an injunction
from Judge Gerald Ramsey.

20:35.145 --> 20:38.090
The vote is to be halted until
new ballots are available,

20:38.156 --> 20:40.411
and these ballots must
contain all candidates,

20:40.436 --> 20:42.315
specifically Miss Margaret Haile.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.032
Well done, Clara. Thank you.

20:45.086 --> 20:47.073
This polling station is closed,

20:47.143 --> 20:49.713
pending the arrival of
the corrected ballots

20:49.960 --> 20:51.502
in approximately...

20:51.783 --> 20:53.556
... six hours from now.

20:53.766 --> 20:55.560
Now, now, gentlemen. Please,

20:55.601 --> 20:58.883
stay a moment longer. I'm
certain we can reach some sort of

20:58.940 --> 20:59.984
arrangement.

21:00.104 --> 21:01.312
Six hours?

21:01.510 --> 21:05.340
It is no small undertaking to print
the number of ballots required.

21:05.353 --> 21:07.954
- In six hours the election will be all but over.
- Well,

21:08.014 --> 21:10.403
ladies, you have succeeded at your goal.

21:10.642 --> 21:12.011
You will have a clean vote,

21:12.250 --> 21:14.468
at the expense of any vote at all.

21:16.196 --> 21:19.809
You knew the body in the morgue
was not Plantagenet McCarthy.

21:19.929 --> 21:23.247
I spent my entire morning
chasing shadows at your behest.

21:23.309 --> 21:25.911
- I demand an explanation, Mr. Meyers.
- Well,

21:26.797 --> 21:28.954
I never did say McCarthy
was real, I just...

21:29.824 --> 21:31.510
neglected to tell you he wasn't.

21:32.805 --> 21:33.947
All right, look.

21:35.064 --> 21:37.166
It was a simple means to an end.

21:37.426 --> 21:40.309
The German spy is real. McCarthy
was created to flush him out.

21:40.355 --> 21:42.326
- Clearly it worked.
- Were you not the least bit

21:42.346 --> 21:45.715
curious as to who had adopted
your fake spy's persona?

21:45.765 --> 21:47.942
I was, until I saw the body.

21:48.392 --> 21:49.542
The red tie explained everything.

21:49.567 --> 21:51.477
You knew right away that he was a plugger.

21:51.679 --> 21:53.374
Why not tell me so that instant?

21:53.452 --> 21:55.943
Because you would have wasted
your time investigating him.

21:55.959 --> 21:58.598
"Him" has a name: Burt Larsen.

21:58.655 --> 22:01.295
And you're right, Mr. Meyers.
I would have investigated him,

22:01.312 --> 22:03.168
which is what I intend to do now.

22:03.526 --> 22:05.551
You're nothing if not predictable, Murdoch.

22:06.191 --> 22:07.786
Look, take my word for it...

22:07.794 --> 22:09.360
You'll forgive me if I don't.

22:10.251 --> 22:12.961
Whoever killed your victim
was in the polling station

22:12.973 --> 22:14.841
and heard him say the name "McCarthy".

22:15.444 --> 22:18.038
This murder has nothing
to do with Burt Larsen

22:18.067 --> 22:20.867
the plugger and everything to do
with Plantagenet McCarthy the spy.

22:21.407 --> 22:23.221
And I have the killer in custody.

22:23.341 --> 22:24.922
- You mean Schmidt?
- I mean Schmidt.

22:24.978 --> 22:27.226
And I suppose you have
some proof of his guilt?

22:28.516 --> 22:30.442
The interrogation is far from over.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.807
Thank you, anyway. I do
appreciate your support.

22:40.436 --> 22:42.312
That's three more voters we've lost.

22:42.432 --> 22:44.961
Their shift is starting and
they won't be able to return.

22:45.162 --> 22:48.488
Keeping the polls closed is skewing the
results as much as if we stayed open.

22:48.608 --> 22:50.420
But a fair election won't
be possible as long as

22:50.451 --> 22:52.616
Margaret's name is absent from the ballot.

22:52.822 --> 22:54.168
Why don't we write it in?

22:54.456 --> 22:56.416
On every ballot until the new ones arrive.

22:56.426 --> 22:57.338
Of course!

22:57.458 --> 23:00.620
The injunction only stated that the
candidates' names be on the ballot...

23:00.647 --> 23:02.508
it didn't specify how
they come to be there.

23:02.552 --> 23:04.952
Surely Mr. Snipe can have no objection.

23:05.212 --> 23:07.174
So, who among us has the best penmanship?

23:08.627 --> 23:10.432
George, how are you coming along

23:10.458 --> 23:12.504
- on Burt Larsen's background?
- Uh, sir,

23:12.525 --> 23:14.339
I've found nothing too out of the ordinary.

23:14.669 --> 23:16.673
He was a hard-working man, unmarried,

23:16.751 --> 23:19.313
who spent most of his evenings
at the pub talking politics.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.823
By most accounts he was well-liked.

23:20.943 --> 23:23.632
And he was the leader of
this group of pluggers, then?

23:23.663 --> 23:25.406
No, sir. He was recruited

23:25.526 --> 23:27.504
by a man named

23:27.540 --> 23:28.578
Duncan Hogan.

23:29.483 --> 23:31.422
- Bring him in.
- Uh, already done, sir.

23:33.349 --> 23:34.777
Hmm.

23:35.612 --> 23:38.879
You know, soon you'll be asking
a Constable to do the same.

23:44.803 --> 23:48.383
My men were doing Toronto and
the province a great service.

23:48.787 --> 23:50.233
Marter has to win.

23:50.986 --> 23:53.321
I tried to tell him how we
could help him, but he wished to

23:53.352 --> 23:55.187
run an honest campaign.

23:55.491 --> 23:56.604
And you disagree?

23:56.795 --> 23:58.532
There are always pluggers.

23:58.569 --> 24:02.057
If we didn't do it for Marter,
Nesbitt would have an unfair advantage.

24:02.434 --> 24:05.465
Mr. Hogan, you are to be charged with fraud

24:05.635 --> 24:08.804
and you're going to be banned from
voting for the next seven years.

24:09.753 --> 24:12.831
I'm prepared to sacrifice
myself for the greater good.

24:13.476 --> 24:14.589
That's very noble,

24:14.893 --> 24:16.708
but I'm not interested in rhetoric.

24:17.012 --> 24:18.986
I'm interested in Burt Larsen.

24:19.811 --> 24:20.780
Of course.

24:21.094 --> 24:22.037
Poor man.

24:22.213 --> 24:25.125
Do you know of anyone who may
have harboured ill will toward him?

24:26.316 --> 24:28.151
He was well-liked in general,

24:28.271 --> 24:31.192
though he did rub the
Conservative party the wrong way

24:31.218 --> 24:32.950
after Marter left them...

24:33.213 --> 24:35.306
especially Dr. Nesbitt.

24:37.027 --> 24:38.347
The Conservative candidate?

24:39.068 --> 24:40.362
Larsen wrote him letters,

24:40.403 --> 24:43.527
hoping to persuade him
to drop out of the race.

24:43.807 --> 24:45.888
What was Dr. Nesbitt's response?

24:47.382 --> 24:49.511
Nesbitt threatened to kill him.

24:52.423 --> 24:54.717
Julia, this gentleman
heard me speak earlier

24:54.753 --> 24:56.542
and was moved to give us his vote.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.888
If we've changed even one man's
mind, then we've already won.

25:30.268 --> 25:31.876
There you are, fine sir.

25:33.319 --> 25:36.005
A mere five minutes and
we'll get you back to the pub.

25:37.350 --> 25:39.628
- Mr. Nesbitt, a word?
- Detective.

25:39.962 --> 25:41.607
Surely those suffragettes

25:41.680 --> 25:43.705
have not lodged yet another complaint?

25:44.251 --> 25:45.993
No... I wonder,

25:46.113 --> 25:47.684
do you know a Burt Larsen?

25:48.069 --> 25:50.085
What has that man said about me now?

25:50.372 --> 25:52.003
He was murdered this morning.

25:52.374 --> 25:53.627
Just a few feet from here.

25:53.915 --> 25:55.632
The dead man was Mr. Larsen?

25:56.308 --> 25:57.328
Hmm!

25:57.519 --> 25:58.416
Well,

25:58.673 --> 26:00.426
that will put a stop to the letters.

26:01.715 --> 26:03.717
That's a rather callous response.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.755
He sent me a letter every single day

26:06.875 --> 26:09.156
haranguing me to drop out of the race!

26:09.951 --> 26:12.306
- Ridiculous!
- You felt threatened?

26:12.368 --> 26:14.537
Goodness, no! I felt annoyed.

26:15.403 --> 26:18.120
Were you aware that Mr. Larsen
was part of a plugging scheme

26:18.192 --> 26:20.134
to benefit your opponent, Mr. Marter?

26:20.320 --> 26:21.820
It wouldn't surprise me.

26:22.491 --> 26:25.212
- You were also heard to have threatened him.
- Detective,

26:25.398 --> 26:27.233
you can't believe that I would kill someone

26:27.264 --> 26:31.006
- over a handful of votes.
- A handful of votes could make all of the difference.

26:31.537 --> 26:33.506
As I understand it, this is one of the most

26:33.511 --> 26:35.243
hotly-contested races in the province.

26:35.269 --> 26:38.378
Oh, I fancy I will
squeak through just fine.

26:38.498 --> 26:39.382
Hmm.

26:39.573 --> 26:41.935
Nevertheless, where were you this morning

26:41.938 --> 26:44.299
- between 8:00 and 8:30?
- I was here, of course.

26:44.419 --> 26:46.393
Surrounded by my campaign supporters.

26:46.919 --> 26:48.254
Ask your wife, Detective.

26:48.769 --> 26:50.342
I was speaking with her.

26:54.598 --> 26:57.809
Thank the Lord! The reprinted
ballots have arrived.

27:00.083 --> 27:02.722
- I'm not sorry that's done!
- Nor me!

27:02.768 --> 27:04.521
I haven't written that much since school.

27:04.583 --> 27:07.383
Mr. Snipe wishes to thank
you for your service, ladies.

27:07.414 --> 27:08.964
You may now leave the building.

27:09.031 --> 27:10.949
Not until we are assured
that all the ballots

27:10.954 --> 27:12.763
are correct and inclusive
of every candidate.

27:13.876 --> 27:15.286
Mr. Snipe, stop!

27:15.598 --> 27:17.800
What on earth is the matter now?

27:19.465 --> 27:21.852
Mr. Snipe, was this same twine

27:21.898 --> 27:24.285
- used on the original ballots?
- Yes.

27:24.405 --> 27:26.310
It's specific to official ballots,

27:26.331 --> 27:29.702
to ensure that no illegal
substitutions can be made.

27:29.822 --> 27:32.197
Right. Who here had access to that twine?

27:32.708 --> 27:35.867
I suppose anyone who
came inside. Mr. Lowrie,

27:35.987 --> 27:38.697
where did you put the discarded
twine from this morning?

27:38.703 --> 27:40.563
In the waste basket, of course.

27:40.683 --> 27:42.032
Mr. Trimble?

27:45.681 --> 27:46.702
It's not here.

27:48.063 --> 27:50.645
Then the killer must have been
inside this polling station.

27:51.512 --> 27:54.197
Right, which would mean Mr.
Meyers was right after all.

27:57.754 --> 27:58.883
Well, Mr. Meyers,

27:58.924 --> 28:00.764
it appears that you were right after all.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.770
And I imagine that Mr.
Schmidt has confessed by now.

28:04.950 --> 28:08.599
Schmidt is, unfortunately,
just an ordinary citizen.

28:09.011 --> 28:11.593
The murder was committed
by a German, just not

28:12.001 --> 28:13.316
that German.

28:13.436 --> 28:15.686
If this is indeed the work of a spy,

28:15.913 --> 28:17.201
we need information.

28:17.809 --> 28:19.712
Everything you know.

28:19.929 --> 28:21.522
And do not say the words

28:21.548 --> 28:23.099
"national security."

28:26.248 --> 28:28.737
We intercepted a message some time ago.

28:29.088 --> 28:31.335
Our top men broke the complex cypher,

28:31.361 --> 28:34.176
and we determined that the
coded address was 8 Beech Street,

28:34.189 --> 28:36.218
obviously Wolfgang Ketzer's lair.

28:37.183 --> 28:40.580
When we arrived we found
nothing but a Chinese laundry.

28:41.842 --> 28:42.894
Clever ducks.

28:43.079 --> 28:44.621
May I see this message?

28:47.789 --> 28:49.360
Gentlemen, I must warn you both,

28:49.401 --> 28:51.780
you place yourself in
great peril by pursuing

28:51.796 --> 28:53.561
this canny and unpredictable man.

28:56.019 --> 28:58.326
Mr. Meyers, your top men

28:58.362 --> 29:01.496
may have been looking for
a cypher that wasn't there.

29:02.568 --> 29:03.653
How so?

29:06.903 --> 29:09.521
52 Selby. Plain as day.

29:11.057 --> 29:13.020
Huh!

29:15.360 --> 29:18.633
We would never have considered
something so simplistic.

29:19.151 --> 29:21.813
That's fantastic!

29:22.782 --> 29:24.111
Come along, Murdoch.

29:24.869 --> 29:26.287
Ha!

29:36.108 --> 29:37.108
Follow my lead, Murdoch.

29:37.154 --> 29:39.294
It's my game you're playing in now.

29:49.559 --> 29:51.371
Huh!

29:54.975 --> 29:57.791
I must stop underestimating these Germans.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.610
And now we wait.

30:13.790 --> 30:16.549
Empty, save for a pair of shoes.

30:21.727 --> 30:23.483
No bed sheet.

30:28.299 --> 30:30.151
And a pipe that hasn't been smoked.

30:30.186 --> 30:31.641
Have a seat, Murdoch.

30:31.709 --> 30:33.984
- He'll be along presently.
- No.

30:34.104 --> 30:36.368
No, I don't believe he will.

30:36.488 --> 30:39.102
You see, much like your
Plantagenet McCarthy,

30:39.141 --> 30:42.382
this Wolfgang Ketzer
does not, in fact, exist.

30:53.321 --> 30:54.867
Impossible!

30:56.213 --> 30:59.068
Oh, this is too much. Of
course he doesn't exist!

31:00.749 --> 31:02.313
I should have known.

31:08.474 --> 31:10.793
So Burt Larsen was killed
for being Burt Larsen,

31:10.796 --> 31:13.809
seeing as Plantagenet McCarthy was
never anything more than a figment

31:13.838 --> 31:16.015
of Mr. Meyers' vivid imagination.

31:16.486 --> 31:18.475
With a name like that, we
should have known all along.

31:19.171 --> 31:20.434
Well, you flatter me, Inspector.

31:20.454 --> 31:22.279
Even I couldn't come up with such a name.

31:23.305 --> 31:25.964
Mr. Meyers, do you mean
to say that you based

31:25.975 --> 31:28.475
your fake spy on a real person?

31:28.939 --> 31:29.753
Of course.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.697
Well, it's standard procedure.

31:32.995 --> 31:35.109
We take a dead man, in this case McCarthy,

31:35.155 --> 31:37.846
we remove his death
certificate from the record, and

31:38.418 --> 31:39.577
voilà.

31:40.028 --> 31:42.634
Did this not strike you at any point

31:42.680 --> 31:44.633
as pertinent information?

31:45.097 --> 31:46.375
Of course not.

31:46.787 --> 31:50.648
The original McCarthy is wholly
irrelevant to the capture of a German spy.

31:50.768 --> 31:53.980
But completely relevant to the
murder of a man assuming his name.

31:54.334 --> 31:56.209
Yeah. Well...

31:56.329 --> 31:58.904
The nation thanks you for your service.

31:59.322 --> 32:00.726
As much as it

32:00.771 --> 32:02.930
pains me to say this, Mr. Meyers,

32:03.110 --> 32:05.533
we now need you.

32:06.460 --> 32:07.310
Well,

32:07.910 --> 32:09.868
Murdoch, if it were anyone else...

32:09.888 --> 32:12.203
But how can I say no to you, hmm?

32:19.574 --> 32:22.143
- Dr. Nesbitt.
- I concur.

32:24.455 --> 32:25.744
Mr. Marter.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.110
I concur.

32:30.236 --> 32:31.736
Miss Margaret Haile.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.170
I concur.

32:33.593 --> 32:35.552
That concludes the extent of the ballots.

32:35.672 --> 32:38.191
Was the count conducted
to your satisfaction?

32:38.258 --> 32:39.067
It was.

32:39.098 --> 32:40.588
- It was.
- It was.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.274
Well, gentlemen,

32:43.331 --> 32:44.995
I wish you both the best of luck.

32:45.558 --> 32:48.454
Whomever wins, you can say you
did so with the utmost fairness.

32:48.574 --> 32:51.934
As trying as this day has been,
I will grant you ladies that.

32:51.996 --> 32:54.119
A fair election was always our intention.

32:54.289 --> 32:56.965
And I, too, am not above
acknowledging your efforts,

32:57.037 --> 33:01.877
- as much as I abhor the theatrics.
- We will take that as a compliment.

33:01.997 --> 33:04.711
This seal will not be broken
until the ballots arrive at

33:04.752 --> 33:07.267
the central elections office to be counted.

33:07.695 --> 33:10.880
Thank you candidates and
scrutineers for your attention.

33:14.066 --> 33:15.875
Well that's that then.

33:16.267 --> 33:18.596
Congratulations, ladies. We survived.

33:18.643 --> 33:20.715
Oh, we did more than survive. We triumphed.

33:20.725 --> 33:23.044
Let's go drink champagne. My treat.

33:23.111 --> 33:25.668
I won't say no to that.

33:26.544 --> 33:28.667
Plantagenet McCarthy.

33:28.925 --> 33:31.525
These are the details we
know of his life so far,

33:31.563 --> 33:34.630
though I suspect most
of it is less than true?

33:35.710 --> 33:37.331
Ah, well, let's see.

33:38.068 --> 33:41.248
McGill University, that's
all me, as is Quebec City.

33:41.602 --> 33:43.371
I certainly made his
life much more exciting.

33:43.396 --> 33:45.374
I doubt the real man ever left Ontario.

33:45.803 --> 33:46.970
When did he die?

33:47.836 --> 33:50.874
1893, '94, thereabouts.

33:51.113 --> 33:52.157
Natural causes.

33:52.239 --> 33:54.669
And what about this
attempt on McCarthy's life?

33:55.712 --> 33:57.245
What was the circumstance?

34:00.490 --> 34:02.330
"Assailant attacks McCarthy

34:02.350 --> 34:05.431
outside of a Mimico
church wielding a knife."

34:05.707 --> 34:06.598
Not my doing.

34:06.961 --> 34:07.934
Mimico?

34:08.156 --> 34:09.377
It's far too pedestrian.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.848
It stands to reason that if
someone wanted McCarthy dead

34:12.873 --> 34:14.612
21 years ago, he likely still would.

34:14.639 --> 34:17.384
Yes sir, but if that man was
in the polling station today,

34:17.400 --> 34:19.780
surely he would have seen
that Burt Larsen wasn't

34:19.813 --> 34:22.196
the Plantagenet McCarthy he once attacked.

34:22.315 --> 34:23.746
It was 21 one years ago.

34:24.089 --> 34:25.684
Larsen's about the right age

34:25.985 --> 34:28.674
and he was wearing a false
moustache and using McCarthy's name.

34:29.498 --> 34:32.455
Is there a description of
McCarthy's assailant in that file?

34:33.754 --> 34:34.847
Well, I admit

34:35.106 --> 34:35.915
I'm intrigued.

34:40.862 --> 34:43.105
Witnesses describe a man in his 30s.

34:43.159 --> 34:44.636
Then he's in his 50s now.

34:45.815 --> 34:48.079
Who on our list of suspects
from the polling station

34:48.099 --> 34:49.481
fits that age?

34:54.417 --> 34:55.291
Only one.

34:55.530 --> 34:56.710
Vernon Snipe.

34:56.744 --> 34:57.831
Excellent!

34:58.177 --> 35:00.762
Let's have a conversation
with Mr. Snipe, shall we?

35:00.840 --> 35:04.684
Oh, I believe we can handle
it from here, Mr. Meyers.

35:04.909 --> 35:06.015
After all,

35:06.135 --> 35:09.293
it's no longer a matter
of national security.

35:14.962 --> 35:18.435
Uh, gentlemen. I'm afraid the
polls have long since closed.

35:18.465 --> 35:21.808
Vernon Snipe, you are to
accompany us to the Station House.

35:22.019 --> 35:23.711
- Now?
- Yes, now.

35:23.831 --> 35:26.001
You're a suspect in a murder investigation.

35:26.121 --> 35:28.933
Gentlemen, please, I have a responsibility

35:28.978 --> 35:31.266
to deliver these ballots
to the elections office.

35:31.298 --> 35:32.993
Uh, I can do that for you, Mr. Snipe.

35:33.113 --> 35:35.712
You heard the gentleman. Hand
over the box and let's go.

35:49.485 --> 35:50.870
Mr. Lowrie...

35:51.154 --> 35:52.628
your gloves.

35:53.375 --> 35:56.365
- What about them?
- Where were you between 8:00 and 8:30 this morning?

35:56.437 --> 35:58.355
I was inside, of course.

35:58.917 --> 36:00.174
Mr. Snipe?

36:01.076 --> 36:04.438
I was outside for the first
half hour, monitoring the line.

36:04.855 --> 36:06.417
Mr. Trimble?

36:06.829 --> 36:07.943
You left me alone

36:08.226 --> 36:10.427
for 10 whole minutes right
at the start of the day.

36:10.845 --> 36:12.768
You didn't even apologize.

36:14.721 --> 36:16.757
Don't even think about it, Mr. Lowrie.

36:16.929 --> 36:18.818
You're under arrest for murder.

36:21.591 --> 36:23.566
Plantagenet McCarthy

36:24.912 --> 36:27.283
rented out the back
room of my father's shop

36:27.403 --> 36:29.865
in Mimico to run a bookmaking business.

36:31.406 --> 36:35.158
My father was sent to
prison for five years,

36:35.406 --> 36:38.787
punished for McCarthy's
crimes. We lost the shop.

36:38.907 --> 36:40.813
My family was disgraced...

36:42.359 --> 36:45.441
Your father attacked McCarthy in 1881.

36:45.889 --> 36:46.945
Yes.

36:48.986 --> 36:50.275
My father

36:50.838 --> 36:52.589
died soon after.

36:54.161 --> 36:55.671
You know, they said it was

36:55.926 --> 36:57.966
some illness he caught in prison,

36:58.301 --> 37:00.048
but I swear he died of shame.

37:01.738 --> 37:03.058
You were just a child.

37:04.965 --> 37:07.800
So when a man roughly the right age

37:07.831 --> 37:11.269
presented himself as Plantagenet
McCarthy at the polling station,

37:11.305 --> 37:14.836
you assumed him to be the
man who ruined your father.

37:15.217 --> 37:17.295
Who else would have that wretched name?

37:18.851 --> 37:20.542
So you grabbed the twine,

37:21.021 --> 37:22.655
followed him outside

37:22.851 --> 37:24.160
and you killed him.

37:25.121 --> 37:28.077
Just as I'd imagined
doing many times before.

37:30.860 --> 37:32.351
Mr. Lowrie...

37:32.830 --> 37:36.499
Plantagenet McCarthy
died several years ago.

37:39.021 --> 37:41.128
The man you assumed to be him

37:41.175 --> 37:43.844
was a plugger named Burt Larsen.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.235
He was innocent,

37:48.385 --> 37:50.013
much like your father.

38:06.833 --> 38:08.745
So it was the clerk all along.

38:09.416 --> 38:10.591
Never would have guessed it.

38:11.266 --> 38:12.524
You're welcome, of course.

38:14.772 --> 38:17.240
If I hadn't made up a spy, you
would never have found your killer.

38:17.472 --> 38:19.678
If you hadn't made up the spy, Mr. Meyers,

38:19.688 --> 38:22.652
- there would have been no killer.
- Oh, such a wet blanket.

38:22.772 --> 38:25.014
If you'll excuse me, I'm to meet my wife.

38:25.426 --> 38:26.586
Of course!

38:26.839 --> 38:27.993
In all of this excitement,

38:28.019 --> 38:29.883
I forgot to congratulate
you on your marriage.

38:30.272 --> 38:32.859
Thank you. We're very happy.

38:33.023 --> 38:35.141
Quite a pistol, that Dr. Ogden, hmm?

38:35.856 --> 38:37.502
Election agitating and all...

38:38.528 --> 38:40.729
Puts me in mind of a noble salmon,

38:41.538 --> 38:44.404
swimming upstream against the current, hmm?

38:46.915 --> 38:47.863
- Do you fish, Murdoch?
- No.

38:47.913 --> 38:48.812
Hmm.

38:50.033 --> 38:51.812
Well, that's a shame.

38:56.964 --> 38:58.513
So you're marrying a copper, then?

38:59.708 --> 39:01.544
I guess I'll have to
be on my best behaviour.

39:01.776 --> 39:03.565
As you should be, copper or no.

39:04.132 --> 39:05.869
We'll get a house with a garden,

39:06.039 --> 39:07.936
maybe a brother or sister for you.

39:08.056 --> 39:09.713
We'll be a proper family.

39:09.833 --> 39:11.914
No sister, OK?

39:12.034 --> 39:13.719
A brother would be
alright, though, no sister.

39:13.839 --> 39:16.832
Well, cross that bridge when we come
to it. Do you want some tea, George?

39:16.863 --> 39:19.131
- Please.
- And uh, if you're

39:19.193 --> 39:20.878
not going to finish your cake,

39:21.567 --> 39:22.663
can I...

39:23.889 --> 39:24.941
Father?

39:28.996 --> 39:30.957
- Hello, son.
- Hi!

39:33.428 --> 39:36.285
I thought you were dead.
They said you were...

39:36.480 --> 39:39.238
... killed. They were
wrong then, weren't they?

39:40.223 --> 39:43.048
Go take my bag into the
bedroom. There's a good lad.

39:43.460 --> 39:45.058
Edna...

39:51.516 --> 39:53.574
You look exactly as I left you.

39:54.414 --> 39:55.440
A policeman!

39:55.991 --> 39:58.481
Has there been some trouble?

39:58.903 --> 40:00.847
- No. Not that I...
- This is

40:00.873 --> 40:02.197
Constable Crabtree.

40:02.986 --> 40:04.785
He's been a great help to us.

40:05.826 --> 40:07.460
Sergeant Archibald Brooks.

40:08.522 --> 40:09.790
Thank you, Constable.

40:10.614 --> 40:12.671
I think I can manage from here on in.

40:13.774 --> 40:15.573
Yes, of course.

40:44.433 --> 40:45.603
Here it is.

40:46.180 --> 40:47.417
North Toronto.

40:47.928 --> 40:50.969
The seat goes to Dr. Nesbitt
and the Conservatives.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.279
But it was close.

40:52.346 --> 40:55.294
The plurality over
Marter was only 232 votes.

40:55.314 --> 40:57.525
Who cares who won? How did Margaret do?

40:57.927 --> 40:59.758
Miss Margaret Haile:

41:00.381 --> 41:03.329
- 79 votes.
- 79!

41:03.607 --> 41:06.086
Oh, that's a great many
more than we anticipated.

41:06.106 --> 41:07.461
That's tremendous!

41:07.472 --> 41:09.564
I'm so proud... of all of us.

41:09.786 --> 41:12.383
Let's take a photograph with the newspaper.

41:13.595 --> 41:16.847
Um, excuse me, Miss Haile, may
I please have your autograph?

41:17.022 --> 41:19.655
Oh, how lovely of you to ask!

41:19.857 --> 41:22.243
You do know, young lady, that
I didn't win the election?

41:22.295 --> 41:23.184
I know.

41:23.304 --> 41:26.222
One day I'd like to
run in an election, too.

41:27.557 --> 41:29.897
Well, you never know,
one day you may just win.

41:30.017 --> 41:31.361
To whom should I address this?

41:31.392 --> 41:34.087
My name is Agnes. Agnes Macphail.

41:34.855 --> 41:36.081
Would you mind?

41:37.153 --> 41:38.503
- Thank you.
- Ready?

41:38.550 --> 41:40.365
Here, hold the newspaper.

41:41.051 --> 41:42.932
Agnes, why don't you hold it?

41:46.595 --> 41:49.405
Smile everyone. To our future!

42:10.421 --> 42:12.344
Thank you for meeting me, George.

42:13.502 --> 42:15.027
How's Simon?

42:15.800 --> 42:17.018
He's happy...

42:17.533 --> 42:19.189
His father's back.

42:20.200 --> 42:21.496
How are you?

42:23.034 --> 42:24.916
- They told me he was dead, George.
- Edna...

42:25.036 --> 42:26.210
I mean, one minute

42:26.251 --> 42:28.421
I'm to be Mrs. George
Crabtree, and the next minute

42:28.787 --> 42:31.787
I'm back to being Mrs. Archibald Brooks.

42:32.441 --> 42:34.076
I... I don't know what to do, George...

42:34.112 --> 42:35.483
The only thing you can do, Edna.

42:36.472 --> 42:38.153
Your husband has come back to you.

42:38.273 --> 42:40.550
Simon's father has returned to him.

42:40.761 --> 42:42.657
Your family's whole again.

42:43.688 --> 42:46.267
- George...
- Edna, go back to your life and be happy.

42:48.836 --> 42:50.733
I want you to be happy.

42:54.521 --> 42:56.109
Goodbye, George.
