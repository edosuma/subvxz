00:37.764 --> 00:40.015
You'll never guess
what's happened now.

00:40.016 --> 00:44.219
Mrs. Bute's been taken ill and
she won't be back again for weeks.

00:44.220 --> 00:46.825
What does that mean? They want me in
London to take over

00:46.826 --> 00:49.477
and they've asked for you
to go with me.

00:49.478 --> 00:52.865
I thought they only needed us
to help with Lady Rose's ball.

00:52.866 --> 00:55.931
The plans have changed,
so you're coming with me

00:55.932 --> 00:59.686
and Ivy can stay to cook
for Mr. Branson and Lady Edith.

00:59.687 --> 01:01.938
Why does Lady Edith look so tired?

01:01.939 --> 01:06.443
She goes away for eight months
to Geneva and comes back looking
more tired than when she left.

01:06.444 --> 01:11.346
We're all tired.

01:12.298 --> 01:13.655
We're not as tired
as we're going to be.

01:13.656 --> 01:16.473
I might go with them. I must look
into Michael's office now I'm back.

01:16.474 --> 01:18.306
Come with me.

01:18.307 --> 01:21.457
No. I have things to do.

01:21.458 --> 01:24.587
Don't imagine for one minute
you can get out of the ball.

01:25.906 --> 01:29.717
Why wasn't Grantham House sold
when Downton was in trouble?

01:29.718 --> 01:35.874
It would have been, eventually, but
not for nearly enough to save us.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.594
So thank God for Matthew.

01:38.578 --> 01:39.935
Dear Matthew.

01:40.979 --> 01:42.335
I do miss him.

01:47.288 --> 01:50.138
Are you looking forward to it?
Why would I be?

01:50.139 --> 01:54.169
What difference does it make
if you peel potatoes in London
or peel them in Yorkshire?

01:54.170 --> 01:55.843
Huh!

01:58.998 --> 02:02.602
Can you do me a favor
when you're in London?

02:02.603 --> 02:07.112
Tell Miss Baxter that I'm looking
forward to hearing the stories
she's got to tell me.

02:07.113 --> 02:11.325
That's an odd message. What stories?
Just tell her. She'll understand.

02:12.664 --> 02:18.668
I'm going up on Tuesday. Robert's
got me invited to the supper
after the presentation.

02:18.669 --> 02:23.209
Lucky you. When are you going
to London? Tomorrow, I think.

02:23.210 --> 02:26.861
I must get some clothes
now I'm back to normal shape.

02:27.980 --> 02:29.334
I...

02:30.532 --> 02:33.984
I know we never talk about the baby.

02:33.985 --> 02:39.690
But I realize it must be
on your mind constantly.

02:39.691 --> 02:43.133
Can we please say she and not "it"?

02:44.799 --> 02:47.649
I wish you hadn't been away so long.

02:47.650 --> 02:53.007
They thought it helps the baby,
to be weaned by her real mother.

02:53.008 --> 02:57.179
Yes. Well, I'm sure everything
worked out for the best.

02:58.311 --> 03:04.722
After all,
your French must be "superb"!

03:04.723 --> 03:07.548
That's right, Granny. Let's get back
to what really matters.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.727
Do we have to go to this?
Of course we do.

03:15.728 --> 03:18.732
If Lady Wimborne gives
a concert and a dinner,

03:18.733 --> 03:20.533
then we should be grateful.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.936
When does the American contingent
arrive?

03:22.937 --> 03:25.039
And how on earth
are we going to manage them?

03:25.040 --> 03:27.623
Don't be ashamed of my mother.
She's your grandmother.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.923
It's very kind of them
to come over for my ball.
You haven't met her yet.

03:29.924 --> 03:36.183
And where will everyone sleep?
This place isn't designed
for house parties. We'll manage.

03:36.184 --> 03:39.374
Perhaps you could share with Edith?
You're joking?

03:39.375 --> 03:42.452
Well, someone may have to sleep on
the top floor, with the servants.

03:42.453 --> 03:44.694
I'd rather sleep on the roof
than share with Edith.

03:44.695 --> 03:46.797
Come on, we're going to be late.

03:51.016 --> 03:52.733
Carson, all this kerfuffle is making
a lot of extra work for the staff,

03:52.734 --> 03:55.288
so I'd like you to plan some sort of
outing for them after the ball,

03:55.290 --> 04:01.524
before we go home.
Very good, Your Ladyship.

04:01.525 --> 04:06.783
Oh, by they way, Madeleine Allsopp
asked if I'd go on
to the Embassy afterwards.

04:06.784 --> 04:09.635
Tonight, after the dinner?
You don't mind, do you?

04:09.636 --> 04:15.034
Rose, once we get past Tuesday -
I don't think you have to be
presented to go to the Embassy Club.

04:15.035 --> 04:17.743
I do love Ambrose And His Orchestra.
Please!

04:17.744 --> 04:20.896
Your niece is a flapper. Accept it.
I'm not a flapper.

04:20.897 --> 04:22.384
But can I go?

04:31.709 --> 04:34.861
Lord Merton, madam. Oh, golly!

04:34.862 --> 04:37.114
Have I forgotten some plan?

04:37.115 --> 04:39.968
No, no. I'm on my way
to dine with the Scroops

04:39.969 --> 04:41.757
and I'm early.

04:41.758 --> 04:44.413
I was driving through the village.
Thank goodness.

04:44.414 --> 04:48.676
I thought I might have to rush
upstairs and bedeck myself out
in family jewels.

04:48.677 --> 04:53.304
After 30 years with Lady Merton,
I'm proof against teasing.

04:54.682 --> 04:58.435
I'm sorry about my humble soup.

04:58.436 --> 05:01.589
Is there anything I can offer you?
No, thank you.

05:01.590 --> 05:04.198
I just wondered if you were going
to Rose's ball?

05:04.199 --> 05:06.679
I'm invited but I doubt it.

05:07.146 --> 05:11.591
Pity. I thought if you were,
I'd make up my mind to go too.

05:11.592 --> 05:15.854
A debutante's ball in high society
is not really my natural habitat,
Lord Merton.

05:15.855 --> 05:19.458
I'm much duller and more serious
than you seem to think.

05:19.459 --> 05:23.241
You may be serious,
the rest I would question.

05:23.814 --> 05:27.288
Enough. I leave you to the delights
of your soup.

05:56.546 --> 05:58.216
Where? Oh, there they are.

06:03.005 --> 06:06.456
Oh, no. What is it? There's my father
and he's seen me.

06:06.457 --> 06:09.760
I think it's rather wild to find
your father in a nightclub.

06:09.761 --> 06:12.312
You wouldn't if it were
a weekly occurrence.

06:12.313 --> 06:15.016
Can't we just wave hello and leave
it at that?

06:15.017 --> 06:16.969
Don't you see whom he's with?

06:16.970 --> 06:19.272
The Prince of Wales!

06:24.177 --> 06:27.948
Your Royal Highness, may I present
my daughter, Madeleine?

06:29.720 --> 06:32.436
Mrs. Dudley Ward,
my daughter, Madeleine.

06:32.437 --> 06:34.688
And this is...?

06:34.689 --> 06:36.751
Lady Rose MacClare.

06:38.591 --> 06:43.697
Your father must be Shrimpie
Flintshire. He is, Your Royal
Highness. Good old Shrimpie.

06:43.698 --> 06:47.573
Won't you join us?
We'd be honored, sir.

06:52.197 --> 06:55.017
How's old Shrimpie getting on?
Pretty well, I think.

06:55.018 --> 06:58.891
Do you know, he put me up in Bombay
last year when I was touring India?

06:58.892 --> 07:02.767
He wrote and told me all about it.
Your visit was a great honor.

07:02.768 --> 07:05.769
I don't know about that.
He was very hospitable.

07:05.770 --> 07:08.622
But I'm afraid I found it
so beastly hot.

07:08.623 --> 07:11.324
How in the name of blazes
does he stand it?

07:11.326 --> 07:14.329
I'm not sure he has much choice
in the matter, sir.

07:14.330 --> 07:18.047
No, indeed.
No choice at all, poor devil.

07:20.336 --> 07:23.787
I can't tell you how pleased I am
to have some reinforcements.

07:23.788 --> 07:27.605
He was rather grouchy. Now look
what a difference you've made.

07:31.148 --> 07:33.913
Have you got everything, Daisy?
I think so.

07:37.604 --> 07:40.756
Well, good luck, then.
I'll see you in London.

07:40.757 --> 07:42.113
Goodbye.

07:48.264 --> 07:52.768
Any orders for Ivy, sir?
Something simple for lunch.

07:52.769 --> 07:54.721
But I'll go down to the pub
for my dinner.

07:54.722 --> 07:56.885
I don't want to make any trouble.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.283
Hello! What brings you here?

08:06.284 --> 08:10.187
I hope to give Mary lunch
and take her to the viewing
of the Summer Exhibition.

08:10.188 --> 08:12.739
It's a special one, isn't it?
My niece is going.

08:12.740 --> 08:16.943
What a nice surprise for Mary.
It's not quite a surprise.

08:16.944 --> 08:19.647
We arranged it last week.
What's all this?

08:19.648 --> 08:24.452
Things for Rose. They didn't dare
take them down the service steps.

08:24.453 --> 08:26.254
Some people have all the luck.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.498
Make sure you're back in time
for Grandmama.

08:31.661 --> 08:34.964
Does Mr. Branson want anything else?
He says not.

08:34.965 --> 08:37.214
And he's having his dinner
in the village.

08:37.216 --> 08:40.369
Marvellous, isn't it?
One minute he's the chauffeur,

08:40.370 --> 08:43.972
and in the normal way of things,
he'd be below me now.

08:43.974 --> 08:46.974
But instead I have to wait on him
hand and foot,

08:46.975 --> 08:50.729
standing there while he decides
what might please him next.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.832
He never strikes me
as being like that.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.935
He always seems friendly.

08:54.936 --> 08:57.528
But we still have to call him sir.

09:04.094 --> 09:08.958
Oh, Lord, Mrs. Levinson's arrived.
Who's that man with the fur collar?

09:08.959 --> 09:10.849
That must be Her Ladyship's brother.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.704
Help me get everything down
and don't make a noise.

09:13.705 --> 09:15.654
Mr. Start will give us a hand.

09:15.655 --> 09:20.010
Grandmama, you're here already.
Mama said you were coming later.

09:20.011 --> 09:23.165
Obviously she thought so,
as did everyone else.

09:23.166 --> 09:26.189
Carson tells me there's no-one
in the house to receive me.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.870
Well, I'm here now.
How was your journey?

09:28.871 --> 09:32.677
How would it be
when my maid turned in her notice
just as we were leaving?

09:32.678 --> 09:36.076
Why? Who knows why these people do
what they do.

09:36.077 --> 09:40.882
Carson, can we help? Shall we let
Mrs. Hughes get inside, My Lady,

09:40.883 --> 09:42.534
and then she can make a plan?

09:42.535 --> 09:46.131
Mrs. Hughes, I didn't know you were
running this house too.

09:46.132 --> 09:48.844
Not as a rule, madam,
but Mrs. Bute is ill,

09:48.845 --> 09:51.094
so I am to take charge
until she's better.

09:51.095 --> 09:56.089
Well, I'm glad at least one person
under this roof knows
what on earth is going on.

09:57.550 --> 10:00.251
Come on.
You're Uncle Harold, aren't you?

10:00.252 --> 10:03.255
Ah... It seems mad that we've never
met before.

10:03.256 --> 10:06.305
Well, I haven't felt the need
to leave America

10:06.306 --> 10:09.486
and to be honest, I don't feel
the need to leave it now.

10:09.487 --> 10:12.824
Grandmama thought it might be fun
for you to see a bit of the season.

10:12.825 --> 10:16.317
You may not know me but I suspect
you've heard enough to grasp

10:16.318 --> 10:19.773
that watching dÃ©butantes in
a ballroom is not my kind of fun.

10:19.774 --> 10:23.228
No, but every now and then it's nice
to try something new, isn't it?

10:23.229 --> 10:26.257
Well, maybe it is
and maybe it ain't.

10:29.534 --> 10:32.536
I'm Jimmy, one of the footmen.
Do you need a hand?

10:32.537 --> 10:36.012
How do you do?
Ethan Slade, valet to Mr. Levinson.

10:40.795 --> 10:42.264
What about you? Do you work here?

10:42.265 --> 10:45.299
I work at the house in Yorkshire
but I'm up here for a bit.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.751
Are you a lady's maid?
No, I'm in the kitchen.

10:47.752 --> 10:49.851
Because we're in need of
a lady's maid and pronto,

10:49.852 --> 10:52.405
preferably with skin
like a rhinoceros.

10:52.406 --> 10:56.261
Daisy is our assistant cook
and I'm Mrs. Hughes, the house-keeper.

10:56.262 --> 10:59.864
Do you know London? I've never
crossed the Atlantic before.

10:59.865 --> 11:02.407
Well, I hope you enjoy yourself.

11:05.571 --> 11:08.678
Are you excited? I'm never excited.

11:13.876 --> 11:16.832
That boiler sounds as if
it's about to blow up.

11:16.833 --> 11:18.636
Do I hear the sound of salvation?

11:18.637 --> 11:23.440
Salvation or chaos. I've just met
Mrs. Levinson on the steps.

11:23.441 --> 11:25.265
She's here without a maid.

11:25.266 --> 11:29.596
What happened to the last one?
She had her head bitten off
one time too many.

11:29.597 --> 11:33.051
Miss Baxter, could you go up
and settle Mrs. Levinson in?

11:33.052 --> 11:36.503
I don't mind
but she and Her Ladyship will
have to make allowances.

11:36.504 --> 11:40.105
I don't think making allowances is
what Mrs. Levinson is famous for.

11:40.106 --> 11:42.138
Ooh, you're a sight for sore eyes.

11:42.139 --> 11:47.512
We've a dinner tonight
and an at-home after,
so there's plenty to do.

11:47.513 --> 11:50.017
What's an at-home? People pop by
for music and chat and so on.

11:50.018 --> 11:53.770
We serve a light supper at eleven
but we never know for how many,

11:53.771 --> 11:55.873
so we've got to be flexible.

11:55.874 --> 11:59.369
Hello, Mr. Molesley.
I hope life's treating you well.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.776
Half the time there's nothing to do,
then it's all hands to the pump

12:01.777 --> 12:04.667
but I don't mind that.

12:06.222 --> 12:11.339
Thomas sent a message. He says he's
looking forward to hearing the
stories you're going to tell him.

12:11.340 --> 12:14.241
What stories? I don't know.
That's what he said.

12:28.088 --> 12:32.304
So what new scheme are you working
on to beat down the upper classes?

12:32.305 --> 12:35.385
You think me much more
of a Robespierre than I am.

12:35.386 --> 12:39.380
Well, I suppose I must accept
that in a post-war world

12:39.381 --> 12:42.443
we toffs are the villains
of every story.

12:42.444 --> 12:46.198
And do you think that's how I feel?
Well, I hope you make exceptions.

12:46.199 --> 12:49.350
Naturally,
I exempt all pig-rescuers. Hmm.

12:49.351 --> 12:54.455
Hello. What's Tony Gillingham doing
here? Talking to Rose, apparently.

12:54.456 --> 12:58.210
You never said you were coming
to this.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.913
Well, I'm glad I have some secrets.

13:00.914 --> 13:05.266
Mary, do you know Mrs. Dudley Ward?
My cousin, Lady Mary Crawley.

13:05.267 --> 13:10.672
How did you come across Rose?
We met through Billy Aysgarth.
Madeleine Allsopp's father.

13:10.673 --> 13:14.127
I've asked them both to come
tonight. Have you told Mama?

13:14.128 --> 13:16.980
I will when I get back.

13:16.981 --> 13:19.831
Have you met Charles Blake?
I know Mr. Blake.

13:19.833 --> 13:24.337
Are you going to this grande soiree,
Gillingham? I am.
Mm. You kept that under your hat.

13:24.338 --> 13:27.790
Dear me. We seem to be
the only people not invited.

13:27.791 --> 13:31.486
What do you think we've done wrong?
Er... You'd be very welcome,

13:31.487 --> 13:33.988
if you wanted to come.
Won't Lady Grantham mind?

13:33.989 --> 13:37.550
Do I spy a dog in the manger?
Not at all.

13:37.551 --> 13:41.905
A dog in the manger tries to protect
a thing he has no use for,

13:41.906 --> 13:45.659
whereas I am looking forward
to this evening very much indeed.

13:45.660 --> 13:47.610
Play nicely, children.

13:47.611 --> 13:49.863
Do you know how these things work?

13:49.864 --> 13:53.305
There's a dinner first and then most
people arrive after half past nine.

13:53.306 --> 13:55.299
Then I shall do what most people do.

13:58.725 --> 14:00.942
Am I glad to see you! We've been
struggling a bit without Mrs. Bute.

14:00.943 --> 14:04.579
And will Mrs. Levinson's arrival
make things simpler, do you think?

14:04.580 --> 14:08.633
I... As a matter of fact,
I'd value your opinion.

14:08.634 --> 14:12.238
Her Ladyship has asked me to organize

14:12.239 --> 14:15.091
a treat for the staff after the ball
as a thank you.

14:15.092 --> 14:18.220
Well, that's very kind.

14:18.221 --> 14:19.894
They've started opening the new
Science Museum in South Kensington,

14:19.895 --> 14:24.146
even though it's not finished,

14:24.147 --> 14:28.454
and I can't decide between that

14:28.455 --> 14:33.258
and a visit to the Crystal Palace
on its new site at Sydenham Hill.

14:33.259 --> 14:37.764
I see. And this is a fun day
as a thank you, is it?

14:37.765 --> 14:41.217
Yes. I think it's very generous.
So do I.

14:41.218 --> 14:44.520
Very generous indeed.

14:44.521 --> 14:47.824
Maybe you should try your ideas
on the staff,

14:47.825 --> 14:50.525
see what they jump at.

14:58.037 --> 15:02.538
Mother! I'm so sorry. I thought
you said you'd be here after five.

15:02.539 --> 15:04.491
Well, we just got away early.

15:04.492 --> 15:06.745
I didn't think I had to make
an appointment.

15:06.746 --> 15:09.478
I had a last fitting and...

15:10.500 --> 15:12.452
Hello, Harold. Hello.

15:12.453 --> 15:15.754
How are you?
A long way from home is how I am.

15:15.755 --> 15:20.108
Harold and I will be spending
some time seeing Europe -

15:20.109 --> 15:22.511
Madrid, Rome, Paris -

15:22.512 --> 15:24.104
and we will enjoy ourselves.

15:24.105 --> 15:26.452
I hope so but somehow I doubt it.

15:26.453 --> 15:30.618
And this is because you
want to put a little space between
you and the Teapot Dome business?

15:30.619 --> 15:34.223
Oh, let's not bring that up again.
It should've have worked.

15:34.224 --> 15:37.226
I'm not much in a drawing room
but I am good at business -

15:37.227 --> 15:39.328
Harold, Harold, we... No.

15:39.329 --> 15:42.636
We came 3,500 miles
so we could change the subject.

15:48.188 --> 15:50.275
Can I help you with that?

15:51.192 --> 15:53.277
I was carrying too many.

15:55.097 --> 15:57.196
You've been avoiding me.

15:57.197 --> 16:00.650
No, I haven't, I've just been busy
these past few months.

16:00.651 --> 16:02.737
Anyway, I'm here now.

16:03.956 --> 16:08.010
I'll get on with this marking.
I'm going to the pub
to get something to eat.

16:08.011 --> 16:10.411
Why don't you join me?

16:10.412 --> 16:14.315
I assume Edith got off all right?
Yes, she did

16:14.316 --> 16:17.768
and she took Mrs. Hughes and Daisy
with her.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.611
I'm just going to the Grantham Arms
to get some dinner. Oh.

16:20.612 --> 16:24.676
May I present Miss Bunting?
She teaches at the school.

16:24.677 --> 16:26.626
Does she?

16:26.627 --> 16:31.132
I wanted to say goodbye.
I may not see you before I go.

16:32.923 --> 16:35.636
My niece is being presented
on Tuesday.

16:35.637 --> 16:40.592
I'm joining them for the supper
afterwards at the Palace.

16:40.593 --> 16:42.545
How nice.

16:42.546 --> 16:45.697
And you're coming up later
for her ball, aren't you, Branson?

16:45.698 --> 16:53.061
Mm. We're off! So sorry.

16:53.062 --> 16:55.608
Well, I'll say my goodbyes.
Does the offer of dinner
still stand?

16:57.260 --> 16:59.512
Right, the first course is ready
to go up.

16:59.513 --> 17:01.615
The soufflÃ© mix is done
for the savory

17:01.616 --> 17:03.809
and I'll make a bechamel
for the cauliflower.

17:03.810 --> 17:09.271
Thank God for you, Daisy. I've never
known your true value till now.

17:09.271 --> 17:12.276
You seem to be in charge,
not like an assistant at all.

17:12.277 --> 17:15.729
We've worked together a long time.
Ever thought of going it alone?

17:15.730 --> 17:19.782
Do you always try
and change people's lives after
you've known them half an hour?

17:19.784 --> 17:25.965
Mr. Levinson, might I ask if you'd be
willing to play the footman
on occasion while you're here?

17:25.967 --> 17:29.514
What? Not every day but when
we have a big evening, like tonight

17:29.515 --> 17:31.347
or Lady Rose's ball.

17:31.348 --> 17:35.399
It's normal in England for the valets
to help out in this way

17:35.400 --> 17:37.501
but it may not be in America.

17:37.503 --> 17:41.557
We don't entertain much but OK.
You're very kind.

17:41.558 --> 17:43.658
I brought some spare liveries
with me,

17:43.659 --> 17:47.320
if you ask James or Molesley
to show you.

17:47.321 --> 17:53.568
I will. And, Mr. Carson, my employer
is called Levinson, not me.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.033
In this house, you both are.

18:01.980 --> 18:05.732
She was not seeing you off.
Sounded like it.

18:05.733 --> 18:08.434
Have you found her very hard?

18:08.435 --> 18:10.687
Losing Sybil was hard.

18:10.688 --> 18:13.817
Compared to that,
everything else has been easy.

18:15.043 --> 18:17.744
Will you show me the house? What?

18:18.909 --> 18:21.496
Oh. Aren't you allowed
to bring your friends back?

18:21.497 --> 18:25.671
It's not a question
of being allowed.
Then what is it a question of?

18:29.158 --> 18:30.537
Yes, quite.

18:31.998 --> 18:35.913
I wish Tom had arrived.
It's so nice to hear you say that.

18:35.914 --> 18:39.967
No, I mean, he's bringing Isis
and I do miss her.

18:39.968 --> 18:43.571
Do you know Lady Grantham's mother,
Mrs. Levinson, and her son?

18:43.572 --> 18:47.025
This is Lord Aysgarth.
A pleasure.

18:47.026 --> 18:51.079
It's quite a crowd.
Yes, but plenty of old friends.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.030
Excuse me.

18:53.031 --> 18:56.160
That's Lord Harrowby. They haven't
seen each other for ages.

18:57.838 --> 19:02.503
He clearly thinks that Lord Harrowby
is more alluring than we are.

19:02.504 --> 19:06.553
The Lady Rosamund Painswick
and Mr. Terence Sampson.

19:07.629 --> 19:09.176
What the devil...? I looked in
at the Warwicks on my way here.

19:09.177 --> 19:12.193
And Mr. Sampson was saying that he'd
stayed at Downton not long ago,

19:12.194 --> 19:19.308
so I made him come with me.
She wouldn't take no for an answer.

19:19.309 --> 19:21.636
We're happy to see you here,
Mr. Sampson. Thank you.

19:21.637 --> 19:26.217
Do you know Lord Aysgarth?
I do. Sampson and I are old friends.

19:26.218 --> 19:27.868
How are you, Billy?

19:27.869 --> 19:32.210
Did you really keep it a secret from
Charles you were coming tonight?

19:32.211 --> 19:36.576
I didn't keep it a secret,
I just didn't tell him.

19:36.577 --> 19:39.280
You certainly don't give up easily.

19:39.281 --> 19:41.366
Well, I won't give up at all.

19:43.636 --> 19:47.088
You're in for a dry night.
No bad thing around this family.

19:47.089 --> 19:50.541
I had a nasty brush with them
up in Yorkshire last year.

19:50.542 --> 19:54.596
Who are they? Lady Grantham's mother
and brother,

19:54.597 --> 19:57.899
over from America, I suppose.
Interesting.

19:57.900 --> 20:03.637
It would be if he plays cards. Why?
They're absolutely made of money.

20:03.638 --> 20:07.059
How do you think the Downton roof
still keeps out the rain?

20:07.060 --> 20:08.935
Do you hear that, Madeleine?

20:11.564 --> 20:14.034
Would you care for one of these?
I think they're quite nice.

20:17.869 --> 20:21.023
Have you lost your mind?
Why? What have I done?

20:21.024 --> 20:24.026
You're a footman,
not a traveling salesman.

20:24.027 --> 20:27.292
Please keep your opinions
on the catering to yourself.

20:32.136 --> 20:35.139
How's it going?
Her Ladyship seems pleased.

20:35.140 --> 20:39.343
We're taking up the buffet now.
I only hope we've got enough.

20:39.344 --> 20:42.346
Dinner, supper and no doubt
a big breakfast tomorrow?

20:42.347 --> 20:45.566
It's a wonder they're not all
the size of a tub.

20:46.437 --> 20:51.656
Oh, Anna, there's an appeal
at the Scottish church
in Pont Street for old clothes.

20:51.657 --> 20:54.058
They're collecting
for Russian refugees.

20:54.059 --> 20:57.361
You won't have brought anything with
you that you'd want to throw away

20:57.362 --> 20:59.763
but you might spread the word.
Of course.

20:59.764 --> 21:03.504
I've been on at Mr. Bates to take
advantage of being in London
and get a few things.

21:03.506 --> 21:07.743
Trouble is, he does hate shopping.
That must be because he's a man.

21:08.474 --> 21:12.170
Do you know England well,
Mr. Levinson? Er, not really.

21:12.171 --> 21:14.629
He hasn't been here
since my daughter got married.

21:14.630 --> 21:19.585
But don't worry. I'm well prepared
for cold baths, warm drinks

21:19.586 --> 21:21.386
and, most of all, the food.

21:21.387 --> 21:24.248
As I said, he doesn't travel much.

21:25.291 --> 21:32.222
They're going into supper.
Harold, why don't you take
Miss Allsopp into the dining room?

21:35.353 --> 21:36.708
Well...

21:39.558 --> 21:41.991
You needn't if you don't want to.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.752
Are you determined to put me off?

21:47.515 --> 21:51.216
OK! Well, if that's what you want.

21:53.673 --> 21:56.673
So shall we? I don't see why not.

21:56.674 --> 21:58.163
Why not what?

21:59.527 --> 22:01.769
Some of us are going on
to the Embassy later.

22:01.770 --> 22:04.031
Oh, what fun.

22:04.553 --> 22:07.705
Oh, well, you can come,
if you'd like. I will.

22:07.706 --> 22:11.449
Why is Sampson here?
Aunt Rosamund brought him.

22:11.450 --> 22:14.463
Papa's livid but there's nothing
to be done. He can't make a scene.

22:14.464 --> 22:16.759
I sometimes feel
we should make more scenes

22:16.760 --> 22:19.521
about things
that really matter to us.

22:19.522 --> 22:23.392
Wouldn't be very English.
No, but I envy it.

22:23.393 --> 22:27.075
All those Latins screaming
and shouting

22:27.077 --> 22:28.617
and hurling themselves
into graves.

22:28.618 --> 22:31.252
I bet they feel much better
afterwards.

22:31.767 --> 22:35.962
I wonder. I think
once you've let it out
it must be hard to get it back in.

22:35.964 --> 22:37.729
Let's go through.

22:40.728 --> 22:44.160
But when do you use this?
This is our sitting room, really.

22:44.161 --> 22:46.058
The drawing room is more formal.

22:47.925 --> 22:53.190
This is for tea or writing letters
or anything like that.

22:53.191 --> 22:57.574
I'd feel as if
I were having tea
in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

22:57.575 --> 23:00.943
No, it's nice, when everyone's here
and the fire's going.

23:01.993 --> 23:04.396
And I'll bet you say
you haven't changed.

23:13.914 --> 23:17.216
So you've seen everything.
Well, the main rooms.

23:17.217 --> 23:19.424
Let me just look down
from the gallery,

23:19.425 --> 23:21.284
then you can take me home.

23:25.222 --> 23:28.178
I'm sorry. I feel a bit awkward,
to be honest,

23:28.179 --> 23:29.821
with them all being away.

23:30.731 --> 23:33.085
Well, I...
I asked if it was allowed.

23:35.433 --> 23:36.787
It's not that, really.

23:50.377 --> 23:54.104
Are they all for the Crawleys?
These are the marriages.

23:54.502 --> 23:58.209
One side's Crawley and the other is
the arms for every Countess.

23:58.210 --> 24:02.358
And the present Lady Grantham?
I don't see one with a dollar sign.

24:02.359 --> 24:03.937
Can I help, sir?

24:07.068 --> 24:09.105
Er, no.

24:09.781 --> 24:14.055
We were just going down.
That is, we only just came up.

24:14.578 --> 24:18.198
And now we're going down again.
Whatever you say, sir.

24:18.527 --> 24:21.915
I'm taking Miss Bunting home. Please
don't lock up till I get back.

24:21.916 --> 24:23.273
Very good, sir.

24:36.128 --> 24:39.814
You did well. Everyone was saying
how delicious the kedgeree was.

24:39.815 --> 24:44.450
Well, that were Daisy's work.
Mr. Levinson had three helpings

24:44.451 --> 24:46.710
and he thought he wouldn't
care for English food.

24:46.711 --> 24:50.238
You've converted him, Daisy,
and that's something to be proud of.

25:00.812 --> 25:03.908
What's so funny?
Freda was showing us a letter.

25:04.671 --> 25:07.414
What's so special about a letter?
Because of who wrote it.

25:07.824 --> 25:10.765
Rose, you must be tiddly.
Oh, I think I am a bit.

25:10.766 --> 25:13.526
It's my fault.
I never should have mentioned it.

25:14.189 --> 25:16.729
Isn't anyone going to dance?
Mr. Levinson,

25:16.730 --> 25:18.890
Madeleine's dying to dance.

25:18.891 --> 25:22.217
Will you rescue her?
Oh, I watch dancing, I don't do it.

25:22.749 --> 25:24.912
I don't believe that. Off you go!

25:26.203 --> 25:29.981
And what about you, Freda? If you
promise not to step on my toes.

25:32.294 --> 25:34.172
I'm afraid Father forced me on you.
Oh, don't worry. I'm used to it.

25:34.173 --> 25:39.534
Used to what? Fathers wanting me
to dance with their daughters.

25:49.928 --> 25:52.925
Would you care to dance? Oh, there's
Nell Foster! How topping.

25:52.926 --> 25:55.985
Can you look after our bags?
Of course.

26:18.143 --> 26:22.830
There's no need for you to stay.
I like to keep an eye on things,
sir.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.583
Do it Mr. Carson's way.

26:25.515 --> 26:27.061
Only last night...

26:28.080 --> 26:30.137
I was concerned
you may have misunderstood.

26:31.082 --> 26:32.437
Sir?

26:35.184 --> 26:39.049
I was having dinner
with Miss Bunting in the village

26:39.050 --> 26:40.799
and she was curious
to look around the house...

26:44.869 --> 26:46.224
... Mr. Barrow.

26:46.999 --> 26:51.003
She might perhaps see it to
more advantage in the daylight, sir.

26:52.386 --> 26:54.974
Yes. And I'm sure she'll be back.

26:56.094 --> 26:59.200
The point is we only went upstairs

26:59.201 --> 27:01.281
so she could enjoy the view
down into the hall.

27:03.152 --> 27:05.259
I wouldn't want you to think
any different.

27:05.910 --> 27:08.778
However you wish to command me,
I am your servant, Mr. Branson,

27:08.779 --> 27:13.436
but I was not aware I was under
orders as to what I might think.

27:19.846 --> 27:23.151
I thought I might arrive and find
you'd already left for London.

27:23.152 --> 27:26.046
As a matter of fact, I'm going up
this morning with Lady Grantham.

27:27.054 --> 27:31.709
I wanted to say you were kind
to write. That's all, really.

27:31.710 --> 27:33.780
Well, when I decided to go
to Rose's ball,

27:34.216 --> 27:37.519
I felt it was wrong not to tell you,
since you'd asked.

27:37.520 --> 27:40.521
What changed your mind?
I suppose it came to me

27:40.522 --> 27:45.176
that these balls and presentations
and comings out

27:45.177 --> 27:49.231
are not just aristocratic folderol
but traditions

27:49.232 --> 27:53.885
by which members of this family
measure their progress through life.

27:53.886 --> 27:55.837
And you wanted to be part of that?

27:55.838 --> 27:58.539
Well, I felt by dismissing it
as trivia,

27:58.541 --> 28:00.793
I was being smug and intolerant.

28:00.794 --> 28:04.332
Do they know what they have in you?
I know what I have in them.

28:06.651 --> 28:10.854
So, have you decided whether or not
you will come to the ball?

28:10.855 --> 28:13.399
Oh, how can you ask?
Of course I will!

28:14.007 --> 28:17.866
But I don't understand.
How can you suddenly be an editor?

28:18.362 --> 28:20.905
I won't be, not in that way,

28:23.361 --> 28:26.272
but Michael gave me
power of attorney.

28:27.071 --> 28:32.070
It didn't matter before
but now they need some decisions.

28:32.569 --> 28:34.689
And you'll have to make them
until he...?

28:35.480 --> 28:38.138
Well, until either he comes back
or...

28:40.286 --> 28:44.339
Is there a will, do you know?
It might be useful.

28:44.340 --> 28:46.521
To help you find out what he wanted.

28:46.892 --> 28:50.944
Wants. I'm sure there is but...

28:50.945 --> 28:53.347
I don't know what's in it yet.

28:53.348 --> 28:56.801
I'll find out.

28:56.802 --> 29:01.906
But what about his child?
Doesn't she have some rights?

29:01.907 --> 29:06.561
His child is not his child any more
or yours.

29:06.562 --> 29:09.715
She belongs
to nice Mr. and Mrs. Schroder

29:09.716 --> 29:12.118
and lives in Geneva
with the rest of her family.

29:12.119 --> 29:16.322
It's all very well saying that
but it doesn't change anything.

29:16.323 --> 29:19.325
Only because you won't let it.

29:19.326 --> 29:22.177
There was no formal agreement.
Maybe not

29:22.178 --> 29:26.083
but it wouldn't be fair to the
Schroders to go back on your word.

29:26.084 --> 29:29.377
Dear Aunt Rosamund, I'm so grateful
for all you've done

29:29.378 --> 29:35.307
and I'm not pulling rank but the fact
remains, you've never been a mother.

29:40.047 --> 29:43.491
You'll never guess.
Oh, try. What is it?

29:43.492 --> 29:47.855
Alfred's finished his course
and they've taken him on.
What, permanent at the Ritz?

29:47.856 --> 29:50.556
As an under chef.
But that won't be for long.

29:50.557 --> 29:53.110
He's going to be famous.
Whoo-hoo! Who is?

29:53.111 --> 29:56.705
Alfred Nugent.
He was a footman at Downton

29:56.706 --> 29:59.118
but he's working at the Ritz now.
He's on his way.

29:59.119 --> 30:01.368
That seems quite
the American dream to me -

30:01.370 --> 30:04.522
poor boy from the sticks
becomes famous hotelier.

30:04.523 --> 30:08.285
Well, I don't know if it's American
or not but I think it's smashing.

30:12.332 --> 30:14.236
..was still here. Nonsense.

30:23.743 --> 30:26.897
What's he doing?
Oh, he just came to see me off.

30:26.898 --> 30:29.321
Huh! But we mustn't lose any time
or we'll miss our train.

30:29.322 --> 30:31.879
I know I'm late.
It couldn't be helped.

30:32.302 --> 30:35.458
Cora insisted I come without a maid.

30:35.906 --> 30:39.752
I can't believe she understood
the implications. Which are?

30:39.753 --> 30:42.935
How do I get a guard
to take my luggage?

30:43.264 --> 30:46.586
And when we arrive in London,
what happens then?

30:47.467 --> 30:50.019
Fear not.
I've never traveled WITH a maid.

30:50.020 --> 30:51.972
You can share my knowledge
of the jungle.

30:51.973 --> 30:53.774
Can't you even offer help

30:53.775 --> 30:57.677
without sounding like a trumpeter on
the peak of the moral high ground?

30:57.678 --> 31:01.024
And must you always sound like
the sister of Marie-Antoinette?

31:02.634 --> 31:05.594
The Queen of Naples was
a stalwart figure.

31:05.595 --> 31:07.701
I take it as a compliment.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.643
You take everything as a compliment.
I advise you to do the same.

31:11.644 --> 31:13.680
It saves many an awkward moment.

31:14.992 --> 31:16.348
Goodbye.

31:23.806 --> 31:27.663
Success. I have finally persuaded
Mr. Bates to buy a new overcoat,

31:27.664 --> 31:30.523
so the refugees can have this.
That's just what they need.

31:30.524 --> 31:34.426
Are you sure? Take it. He'd only go
on wearing it if it's in the house.

31:34.427 --> 31:37.470
Well, they'll be very grateful.
I'd better get back.

31:37.471 --> 31:41.224
There's always plenty of fuss
before a presentation.

31:41.225 --> 31:43.625
There is but I think it's exciting.

31:43.626 --> 31:46.812
Seems odd to me that a courtesy
and a nod from the throne

31:46.813 --> 31:50.820
can turn you from a girl into a woman
but who are we to argue?

31:59.994 --> 32:03.231
Oh!

32:03.232 --> 32:05.033
May I help, Mrs. Hughes?
I was just looking for Anna

33:06.215 --> 33:08.616
but it doesn't matter.

33:08.617 --> 33:11.094
Now we have to go our separate ways.

33:11.095 --> 33:13.212
I feel quite nervous. Nonsense.
Onwards to the breach.

33:24.832 --> 33:28.328
The Countess of Grantham presenting
the Lady Rose MacClare.

33:28.329 --> 33:29.684
Thank you, Lady Grantham.

33:35.795 --> 33:38.495
I hope you don't want
to powder your nose. Why not?

33:38.496 --> 33:41.950
Because all that's on offer is
a chamber pot behind that screen.

33:41.951 --> 33:43.463
The glamour of court life!

33:44.655 --> 33:47.105
Who's presenting you?
My father's eldest sister.

33:48.859 --> 33:51.345
Aunt Violet wanted to present me
but we got round it.

33:52.012 --> 33:54.113
She'll be at the supper
as a consolation.

33:54.114 --> 33:56.210
Papa's coming.
So are my mother and my brother.

33:56.211 --> 33:59.669
Mr. Levinson's here and Mrs. Levinson?
How did you manage that?

33:59.670 --> 34:02.522
Lord Grantham is
our Lord Lieutenant.

34:02.523 --> 34:06.426
And he pulled a string to get them
in? Father will be so pleased.

34:06.427 --> 34:09.360
Madeleine. Gosh, that's me.
Good luck.

34:09.362 --> 34:10.717
So she's in the library
and she's on her own. Are you sure?

34:13.184 --> 34:16.362
What do you want with her?
Nothing that would interest you.

34:17.239 --> 34:21.049
Mr. Carson, I wonder...

34:23.695 --> 34:25.356
I'm sorry. Don't mind me.
I'm just leaving.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.543
Can I help?

34:37.206 --> 34:38.583
I wanted to ask you, man to man,

34:39.808 --> 34:47.628
if anything's going on between Daisy
and the fella working at the Ritz.

34:47.629 --> 34:54.025
Going on? Nothing goes on in
any house where I am in authority.

34:54.025 --> 34:58.681
Of course not. I didn't mean that.
What did you mean?

34:58.682 --> 35:03.893
I think you know.
The "fella" is called Alfred.

35:04.582 --> 35:07.151
There is no romance
between him and Daisy.

35:07.152 --> 35:11.294
He has left our employ.
I doubt they'll meet in the future.

35:11.295 --> 35:14.910
Because I wouldn't like to push in
where I'm not wanted.

35:22.557 --> 35:27.284
The Duchess of Margam presenting
the Lady Elizabeth Bailey George.

35:49.585 --> 35:53.437
The Countess of Grantham presenting
the Lady Rose MacClare.

36:14.962 --> 36:17.696
Lady Rose is Lord Flintshire's
daughter, sir.

36:18.564 --> 36:21.161
Ah! The Prince of Wales has spoken

36:21.162 --> 36:23.803
about your father's hospitality
in Bombay.

36:25.172 --> 36:28.323
He was honored to entertain
His Royal Highness, Your Majesty.

36:28.325 --> 36:31.386
The Indian tour was a great success,
thanks to Lord Flintshire.

36:31.778 --> 36:36.178
The Prince did splendidly, sir.
He was so popular wherever he went.

36:37.485 --> 36:40.598
Yes. The Prince is never short
of popularity.

36:42.682 --> 36:44.038
Lady Grantham.

36:49.198 --> 36:53.630
The Countess of Derwentwater
presenting the Lady Jane Radcliffe.

37:01.959 --> 37:04.471
So Bates was in London that day.

37:06.165 --> 37:08.569
You say it as if you already knew.

37:12.321 --> 37:14.795
Does Anna suspect anything?

37:15.624 --> 37:18.219
Absolutely not. She knows nothing.

37:20.430 --> 37:23.905
So will you tell her now, My Lady?
I gather you won't.

37:24.934 --> 37:28.003
No. No, I'm handing this to you.

37:28.688 --> 37:30.523
Meaning leave it alone?

37:31.690 --> 37:34.740
We can't know what happened
on that street.

37:34.741 --> 37:37.220
Maybe he was in London
for an innocent reason

37:37.221 --> 37:39.133
and nowhere near Piccadilly.

37:40.851 --> 37:46.237
But this I will say. If he was there
to avenge his wife's honor,

37:47.609 --> 37:49.115
I won't condemn him for it.

37:49.607 --> 37:51.979
I'm sorry but I won't.

37:58.720 --> 38:03.524
Oh! All done?
Presented, photographed, done.

38:03.525 --> 38:07.130
You both looked splendid.
You didn't look so bad yourself.

38:07.131 --> 38:09.380
The unfair advantage
of a court position.

38:09.381 --> 38:11.936
I hear the King was very talkative,
for him.

38:12.686 --> 38:17.039
How was the Queen?
You know - she sort of sits there
being Queen Mary-like.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.890
Any chance of meeting them later?
Hardly.

38:19.892 --> 38:23.644
His Majesty is not an admirer
of the New World.

38:23.645 --> 38:26.425
You might do better
with the Prince of Wales.

38:30.253 --> 38:33.131
I'm not one of those Englishmen
who hates New York

38:33.557 --> 38:35.658
but a great city can be
a lonely place.

38:35.659 --> 38:38.580
Can't everywhere? But you'd only
be lonely if you wanted to be.

38:40.014 --> 38:42.332
Do you know Newport?
Why?

38:42.333 --> 38:45.540
I stayed there before the war with
the Duchess of Marlborough's mother.

38:46.066 --> 38:51.124
I thought it was wonderful.
As a matter of fact,
I'm in Newport quite a lot.

38:51.125 --> 38:54.231
I have what they call a cottage
on Bellevue Avenue.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.980
Really? I didn't know.

38:56.981 --> 38:59.684
Didn't you? Huh!

38:59.685 --> 39:03.781
I feel rather guilty
about leaving Isobel behind. Why?

39:03.782 --> 39:06.891
She brought a book with her.
That should keep her occupied.

39:06.892 --> 39:10.194
What sort of book?
I can only tell you

39:10.195 --> 39:12.898
that on the train
it was far more interesting than me.

39:16.651 --> 39:18.804
Your father's paying
a lot of attention to my mother.

39:20.256 --> 39:23.490
You think we ought to tell him
she only has an income for life?

39:24.759 --> 39:27.279
You are funny!
Oh, that's right.

39:27.280 --> 39:30.916
The English upper classes never talk
about money. We don't like to.

39:30.917 --> 39:32.807
But you don't mind thinking
about it.

39:33.770 --> 39:36.085
Er... Or at least,
your father doesn't.

39:38.275 --> 39:40.460
We should tell him
before he's in too deep.

39:40.826 --> 39:44.737
When she dies, all the capital
reverts to me. He ought to know.

39:54.282 --> 39:58.723
Rose. Oh! Are you at all
the presentation courts?

39:58.724 --> 40:01.249
You are good! There are only four

40:01.250 --> 40:03.883
and David... I mean,
the Prince likes me here.

40:04.864 --> 40:06.741
He said you were very sweet
about him.

40:08.155 --> 40:09.520
Is something the matter?

40:10.408 --> 40:14.326
Do you remember that letter we were
laughing about the other night? Yes.

40:15.213 --> 40:19.265
Well, the thing is,
when I got home, it was missing.

40:19.266 --> 40:23.020
It wasn't in my bag
and I know I put it back. I saw you.

40:23.021 --> 40:26.324
I was so hoping
you might have taken it, as a prank.

40:26.325 --> 40:30.266
I won't be a bit cross if you did.
I'm afraid not. Try Madeleine.

40:30.267 --> 40:33.652
It wasn't her. It... It's just...

40:34.283 --> 40:36.972
If it falls into the wrong hands...
No need to explain.

40:37.886 --> 40:40.739
Has anyone been in touch,
asking for money?

40:40.740 --> 40:43.526
I wish they had.
Then I'd know how to get it back.

40:44.794 --> 40:48.097
Ah! Do they talk much,
the King and Queen?

40:48.098 --> 40:52.455
They were very kind. Well, you're
not presented for conversation.

40:53.202 --> 40:57.241
This is Mrs. Dudley Ward.
Of course you are!

40:58.160 --> 41:01.433
Have we met? No. I read about you
in the American newspapers.

41:01.435 --> 41:03.743
Gossip, really.
Nothing to worry about.

41:04.510 --> 41:06.753
But never give them a real story.

41:19.479 --> 41:20.989
How do you do? Harold Levinson.

41:22.032 --> 41:26.538
You're mistaken, sir. I'm not Harold
Levinson, whoever he may be.

41:26.539 --> 41:29.208
Er, no, no, no. I'm Harold Levinson.

41:29.692 --> 41:31.819
Then why did you say I was?

41:46.584 --> 41:47.965
Cousin Robert? Mm?

41:50.188 --> 41:52.286
I've got such a funny question.

41:52.891 --> 41:54.730
It seems an awful thing to say

41:54.731 --> 41:59.798
but do you think your friend
Mr. Sampson might be capable
of something dishonorable?

41:59.799 --> 42:02.009
He's not my friend.

42:02.650 --> 42:04.904
Why do you ask? Well...

42:07.305 --> 42:09.975
It was when we were at the Palace,
at the supper.

42:10.459 --> 42:14.101
Go on.
Do you remember Mrs. Dudley Ward?

42:16.001 --> 42:17.696
Did you notice how upset she was?

42:20.000 --> 42:23.184
He wanted Miss Allsopp to go
on a picnic luncheon in the park?

42:23.185 --> 42:27.274
The picnic was my idea.
He thinks he's offended her
and he wants to make it up.

42:27.275 --> 42:30.578
He can't go on a picnic
with a young lady on her own.

42:30.579 --> 42:33.131
What is he thinking of? Why not?

42:33.133 --> 42:37.088
Because we're not in America
and she isn't a chorus girl.

42:37.089 --> 42:40.662
Don't worry! He's asked her father
and Mrs. Levinson to come along.

42:40.663 --> 42:43.436
And who's going to prepare
this picnic, when it's at home?

42:44.186 --> 42:47.997
Daisy can make it!
And come along, to help me serve.

42:47.998 --> 42:51.451
Don't be daft. I work
in the kitchen, I don't serve.

42:51.452 --> 42:54.648
Then I'll serve! You get it ready
and set it out and...

42:56.106 --> 42:59.559
I'll serve.
Oh, I see.

42:59.560 --> 43:05.115
You see what? It's not set in stone
that you shouldn't help at a picnic.

43:05.116 --> 43:07.483
I can spare you,
if you think they'll come.

43:07.484 --> 43:11.157
Lord Aysgarth will come if he knows
old mother Levinson's aboard.

43:12.023 --> 43:14.530
Oh, very respectful, I must say!

43:16.078 --> 43:19.240
I'll be sorry if he means to revive
the ways of his grandpapa,

43:19.241 --> 43:21.483
winking at every beauty
in an opera box.

43:21.484 --> 43:25.828
It must be a lonely job.
All the public want is
a happy marriage at the Palace.

43:25.829 --> 43:27.304
Is it so much to ask?

43:28.091 --> 43:31.637
And anyway, why did Mrs. Dudley Ward
have the letter in her handbag?

43:32.145 --> 43:36.799
I expect it was a love thing.
It won't be much of a love thing
when it's in the American papers.

43:36.800 --> 43:40.621
Do you think that's why he took it?
Sampson took it to make money.

43:41.905 --> 43:46.259
The question is whether he means
to blackmail Mrs. Dudley Ward
or sell it to the foreign press.

43:46.260 --> 43:50.465
No wonder she was in such a state.
I can't tell you what it said.

43:50.466 --> 43:54.823
Don't! I'm a monarchist
and that's why I would like
the letter retrieved

43:54.825 --> 43:57.014
and why I do not wish to know
its contents.

43:58.016 --> 43:59.395
I feel so guilty!

44:00.225 --> 44:04.427
If I hadn't joked about it,
he would never have suspected
it was in her handbag.

44:04.428 --> 44:06.679
Good God.

44:06.680 --> 44:09.081
Then we have to do something,
at once.

44:09.082 --> 44:12.085
If we're lucky, the letter will be
at Sampson's flat.

44:12.086 --> 44:15.839
We must get him away from there
and someone must go in and -

44:15.840 --> 44:19.294
Steal it? You can't steal something
that's already been stolen.

44:19.295 --> 44:23.180
But how would we get in?
We can't very well pick the lock.

44:29.100 --> 44:32.533
James, could you please ask Bates
to come to the drawing room?

44:34.611 --> 44:36.410
Are we ready? We are, sir.

44:36.411 --> 44:39.714
Only, Ivy has a basket
of kitchen things to carry

44:39.715 --> 44:44.520
and it will be a bit of a squash
for her and me and the basket
in the front.

44:44.521 --> 44:46.668
You mean, you want to sit next to me
in the back?

44:48.427 --> 44:52.176
And if I were His Lordship,
would you ask to sit next to him?

44:52.177 --> 44:54.570
Well, I doubt we'd be in
the same car, sir.

44:54.571 --> 44:55.926
If you were?

44:57.433 --> 44:59.686
We could just tie my basket
on the back.

44:59.687 --> 45:01.166
I think that would be
the best solution.

45:02.089 --> 45:05.881
Good. That's settled, then.

45:08.695 --> 45:12.450
You've made everything I asked for?
It wasn't very complicated.

45:12.451 --> 45:15.001
Mr. Levinson does not like
complicated food.

45:15.002 --> 45:16.953
That's why he likes English cooking.

45:16.955 --> 45:21.007
How are you going to manage it,
now old Lady Grantham's going
and Mrs. Crawley?

45:21.008 --> 45:24.461
It's a lot of work.
You'd better take James with you.

45:24.462 --> 45:27.164
We can manage with Mr. Molesley
for lunch. Yes.

45:27.165 --> 45:30.918
Would you mind? I'm a footman.
I don't have the right to mind.

45:30.919 --> 45:32.871
Thank you, Wat Tyler.

45:32.872 --> 45:37.375
Where are you meeting them?
A place called the Albert Memorial,

45:37.376 --> 45:39.776
but er... will I know it
when I see it?

45:39.777 --> 45:43.382
You most certainly will,
I can promise you that.

45:43.383 --> 45:46.686
Now, I've got rugs, cushions
and folding chairs.

45:46.687 --> 45:48.302
Come on. You'd better get started.

45:50.289 --> 45:53.441
It's very good of you to spare her.
It won't kill me.

45:53.442 --> 45:55.543
She deserves a bit of luck.

45:55.544 --> 46:00.799
I'm afraid that boy's interest
in her may not be entirely proper.

46:00.800 --> 46:05.754
Mr. Carson, all women need
someone to show a bit of interest
every now and then,

46:05.755 --> 46:08.902
preferably in a manner
that's not entirely proper.

46:13.413 --> 46:16.991
Hm, hm.

46:16.992 --> 46:20.424
Bates, during your time... away,

46:20.425 --> 46:24.054
did you ever meet a man
who could copy someone's writing?

46:24.055 --> 46:25.484
Do you mean a forger, My Lord?
Yes, I suppose I do.

46:25.485 --> 46:27.874
What would he be required to do?
We have to gain entry
to someone's flat,

46:27.875 --> 46:30.379
so the porter needs to be told
to unlock the door.

46:30.380 --> 46:34.284
The order will come in the form
of a signed note. I see.

46:34.285 --> 46:37.405
I assume we have a sample
of this person's writing.

46:37.406 --> 46:41.634
Do we?
He sent a bread and butter letter
after our party the other night.

46:41.635 --> 46:44.136
Then I can get it done.
How long will it take?

46:44.137 --> 46:45.847
If I can have the letter
straightaway,

46:45.848 --> 46:49.142
I believe I can supply the note
by the end of the afternoon.

46:49.143 --> 46:53.203
So the man is here in London? He is,
My Lord. What a stroke of luck.

46:53.204 --> 46:55.907
I know this sounds rather dodgy,
Bates,

46:55.908 --> 46:59.961
but there is nothing underhand
in what we're trying to achieve -
quite the reverse.

46:59.962 --> 47:02.636
Your word is enough for me, My Lord.

47:08.371 --> 47:12.714
Please don't ruin everything,
not when it's over and done
and nobody knows.

47:12.715 --> 47:16.975
Granny knows. Is she going to reveal
the bastard child
of her own granddaughter?

47:17.671 --> 47:22.475
Remember, you were never going to
mention it, even if he came back.

47:22.476 --> 47:25.628
I know I said that but I don't think
I could keep to it now.

47:25.629 --> 47:30.734
Why? Is there some news?
Not really. A bit.

47:30.735 --> 47:34.038
It seems he got into a fight
with a gang of toughs

47:34.039 --> 47:36.590
the first night he was in Munich.
A gang of toughs?

47:36.591 --> 47:39.144
They're quite well-known, apparently.

47:39.145 --> 47:44.698
They wear brown shirts and go around
preaching the most horrible things.

47:44.699 --> 47:49.354
Anyway, a man who was there says
that Michael took exception
to what they were saying.

47:49.355 --> 47:51.907
He should have had the sense
to keep out of it.

47:51.908 --> 47:54.159
But surely, if they know these men,

47:54.160 --> 47:56.859
they can question them
and find out what happened.

47:56.860 --> 47:58.872
You'd think so.

48:00.592 --> 48:05.721
Oh, my dear. I can be normal
most of the time for weeks on end

48:05.722 --> 48:10.675
but then I think I might never see
him again and...

48:10.677 --> 48:15.181
I know. But that's not the point.

48:15.182 --> 48:19.085
If Michael is dead, if I do inherit,

48:19.086 --> 48:21.338
then I have to give at least half
to the baby.

48:21.339 --> 48:24.942
Don't you see? No, I don't.

48:24.943 --> 48:28.845
But if you really must,
do it anonymously.

48:28.846 --> 48:30.362
It wouldn't be hard.

48:36.956 --> 48:39.956
This is for the best.

48:39.957 --> 48:42.209
If you'll only keep silent,

48:42.210 --> 48:47.164
there'll be other loves,
other children.

48:47.165 --> 48:51.219
Don't cheat yourself of that,
I beg you.

48:51.220 --> 48:53.920
I don't know.

48:53.921 --> 48:58.942
Then trust me... because I do.

49:06.686 --> 49:09.688
What's that you're doing?

49:09.689 --> 49:11.988
Something for His Lordship. Hm.

49:15.245 --> 49:19.448
Are you enjoying being in London?
I am.

49:19.449 --> 49:23.202
Makes a nice change.
Oh, it does for me, right enough.

49:23.203 --> 49:26.655
I haven't been here since I buried
my mother, halfway through the war.

49:26.656 --> 49:29.208
Has it been that long?

49:38.819 --> 49:41.959
My, my.
Of course I understand
why the letter must be recovered.

49:41.960 --> 49:43.762
I don't see why
it has to involve me.

49:43.763 --> 49:47.364
Someone has to fetch the letter
whilst we distract Sampson.

49:47.365 --> 49:50.668
Can't Rose go?
On her own? Have a heart.

49:50.669 --> 49:53.521
Well, you, then. I'm the one
hosting the card game.

49:53.522 --> 49:55.923
The question is, who else can play?

49:55.924 --> 49:58.176
They must be genuine
or it will smell fishy.

49:58.177 --> 50:01.029
Tony Gillingham would come
but we'd have to tell him.

50:01.030 --> 50:04.633
I know who'd play and bring Sampson
and we needn't say a word.

50:04.634 --> 50:07.185
Lord Aysgarth.
Grandmama can sit on his lap.

50:07.186 --> 50:11.690
I don't want her here. She'll make
some crack and give the game away.

50:11.691 --> 50:13.663
What can we do with her?

50:14.996 --> 50:19.949
Send a note to Rosamund.
Ask her to take Martha to a play.

50:19.950 --> 50:21.900
And Mama and Isobel.

50:21.901 --> 50:24.003
Tell her to give them supper
afterwards.

50:24.004 --> 50:28.659
They'll have to change
once they're back from their picnic,
so we won't be stuck with them long.

50:28.660 --> 50:32.264
I hate to lie.
I'll do it. I don't mind lying.

50:32.265 --> 50:36.165
We ought to give the men dinner.
It will make it more normal.

50:36.166 --> 50:40.069
But won't Sampson be suspicious?
He must be aware you don't like him.

50:40.070 --> 50:42.473
I'll tell Aysgarth
that Harold will play.

50:42.474 --> 50:46.075
Fleecing your uncle will be
too tempting for Sampson to resist.

50:46.077 --> 50:49.078
Suppose Uncle Harold would rather go
to the theater?

50:49.079 --> 50:51.481
Ask Lord Aysgarth
to bring his daughter.

50:51.482 --> 50:55.014
I don't like the idea of you two
setting off to burgle his flat.

50:55.015 --> 50:58.990
I can't allow it. We could ask
Evelyn Napier. He's in France.

50:58.991 --> 51:04.695
Mr. Blake, then. But I know
what the letter looks like.
Suppose the porter calls the police?

51:04.696 --> 51:07.848
Do you want the heir to the throne
to be lampooned across the world

51:07.849 --> 51:09.801
with a story that will never sleep,

51:09.802 --> 51:12.805
even when he's safely crowned
and married to a princess?

51:12.806 --> 51:15.808
No, but I do feel he's brought it
down on his own head.

51:15.810 --> 51:19.561
Even if that's true, we introduced
Sampson to Mrs. Dudley Ward

51:19.562 --> 51:22.113
and Rose as good as gave him
the letter.

51:22.114 --> 51:26.941
This family is responsible
for the whole ghastly debacle.

51:32.636 --> 51:36.229
The pate was delicious,
now the fish mousse is delicious

51:36.230 --> 51:40.134
and all my life I've been warned off
English food.

51:40.135 --> 51:44.337
I'm glad we score in one category.
The menu was very unoriginal.

51:44.338 --> 51:46.589
I like my food good.
I don't want it original.

51:46.590 --> 51:48.690
So England is the right place
for you.

51:48.691 --> 51:53.902
So, I know you're a lord
but what kind of lord are you?
There are different kinds?

51:53.903 --> 51:56.650
The British peerage is
a fountain of variety.

51:56.651 --> 51:59.503
It's just a lowly barony,
I'm afraid,

51:59.504 --> 52:01.755
but it's quite old.

52:01.756 --> 52:04.908
So you are not Lady Madeleine?

52:04.909 --> 52:09.564
No, but she's an Honorable.
Who would doubt it?

52:09.565 --> 52:12.567
So how long is it
before you go home?

52:12.568 --> 52:18.724
Late Friday we leave for Paris
and then for Rome.

52:18.725 --> 52:21.727
I envy you, to see Europe
as you will see it.

52:21.728 --> 52:25.631
What do you mean? Drifting
from great hotel to great hotel,

52:25.633 --> 52:29.836
no-one to hurry you,
no-one to pester you -

52:29.837 --> 52:34.189
like the world as it used to be.
You mean, with no expense spared.

52:34.190 --> 52:39.473
I meant how charming it would be
to see it with Mrs. Levinson.

52:41.548 --> 52:44.250
Another whiskey, would you?

52:44.251 --> 52:47.252
Is it going all right?
As far as you're concerned.

52:47.253 --> 52:50.106
But the old lady treats His Lordship
like a bad smell.

52:50.107 --> 52:52.660
Rose says you have
quite a reputation at home.

52:52.661 --> 52:54.833
As a playboy, you mean?

52:56.689 --> 52:59.741
I know it's hard to believe
but it's true.

53:00.618 --> 53:05.422
I... I own a yacht
and I like pretty girls...

53:05.423 --> 53:08.726
..and er...

53:08.727 --> 53:12.030
Can I be honest? Please.

53:12.031 --> 53:15.182
The best thing is those girls don't
expect a thing from me

53:15.183 --> 53:20.137
beyond a good time and a diamond
bracelet as a thank-you note.

53:20.138 --> 53:23.743
And do you like that too?
Nobody gets disappointed.

53:23.744 --> 53:26.745
And I hate to disappoint people.

53:26.746 --> 53:32.000
Is it why you never married?
Oh, what a leading question.

53:32.001 --> 53:33.953
I thought well-born English girls

53:33.954 --> 53:36.805
were supposed to be reticent
and refined.

53:36.806 --> 53:38.350
That was before the war. Ah!

53:40.860 --> 53:45.363
Well, I would find it hard
to respect any woman
who wished to marry me.

53:45.364 --> 53:48.217
But plenty of nice women would want
to marry you, Mr. Levinson.

53:48.218 --> 53:50.386
You mean, because I'm rich?

53:52.724 --> 53:56.175
You are strange. You invite me here
today as an apology

53:56.176 --> 54:00.068
and yet you seem bent
on offending me again. I hope not.

54:01.583 --> 54:06.536
Because I like you very much,
Miss Allsopp.

54:06.537 --> 54:10.591
More than any lady
I have ever known,

54:10.592 --> 54:13.706
if I may use the term.

54:14.784 --> 54:16.747
But you won't go along
with Papa's scheme? No.

54:16.748 --> 54:22.003
And you wouldn't want me to.
How do you know that?

54:22.004 --> 54:25.043
Because you're better
than your father, Miss Allsopp.

54:29.362 --> 54:32.514
Will you warn your mother off him?

54:32.515 --> 54:36.654
Oh, my mother can look after
herself, believe me.

54:38.069 --> 54:40.771
Can you really manage? Oh, yes.

54:40.772 --> 54:43.474
You were going to be ten anyway,
now everyone's here,

54:43.475 --> 54:46.849
so 14 makes no difference.

54:47.680 --> 54:51.433
I only hope Mrs. Hughes can sort out
the sleeping arrangements.

54:51.434 --> 54:55.337
Mm. We're packed in like sardines
but I suppose it's not for long.

54:55.338 --> 55:01.503
Ooh! If the family's sardines,
My Lady, the staff are like maggots.

55:02.996 --> 55:07.050
Erm, where's Bates? He were in
the servants' hall earlier on.

55:07.051 --> 55:11.088
Thank you, Mrs. Patmore.
My Lady.

55:15.760 --> 55:18.913
His Lordship asked if there's
any news on the note for tonight.

55:18.914 --> 55:21.169
It's here, My Lady.

55:24.019 --> 55:28.372
But that's extraordinary. How did
you get him to do it so quickly?

55:28.373 --> 55:30.162
He had nothing else on. It's all
quite proper, whatever it may seem.

55:30.163 --> 55:35.129
As His Lordship assured me.

55:35.130 --> 55:38.432
Good luck with the recovery plan
when you get to Mr. Sampson's flat.

55:38.433 --> 55:40.245
We'll let you know.

55:40.836 --> 55:45.085
Well, I'd better tell His Lordship
we're all set.

55:47.443 --> 55:49.995
It's a funny thing about London,
isn't it,

55:49.996 --> 55:53.599
the way it seems to draw one
into peculiar situations?

55:53.600 --> 55:56.151
Like any big city.

55:56.152 --> 56:00.182
I expect many people must regret
things they got up to in London.

56:04.410 --> 56:07.332
Is there anything I can do, My Lady?

56:09.516 --> 56:13.569
It's only that we've forced
this dinner on Mrs. Patmore
without warning.

56:13.570 --> 56:16.274
I was checking to see
if she was on top of it.

56:16.275 --> 56:19.522
Mrs. Patmore is very resilient.

56:23.330 --> 56:26.634
I'm not sure I can leave it alone,
with the ticket.

56:26.635 --> 56:29.335
We're talking about a man's life,
Mrs. Hughes.

56:29.336 --> 56:34.140
Whatever we may think,
do we have a right to do nothing?

56:34.141 --> 56:37.744
So Mr. Bates must be ruined,
or even hanged,

56:37.745 --> 56:41.950
because a vile, vicious monster is
no longer with us?

56:41.951 --> 56:44.202
I'm sorry. What you're asking me
to do is wrong.

56:44.203 --> 56:48.528
Whoever the man,
whatever the motive, it's wrong.

56:54.113 --> 56:58.166
What? A card game? Here?

56:58.167 --> 57:00.420
And what
are the ladies supposed to do?

57:00.421 --> 57:04.171
Put feathers in their hair
and light the gentlemen's cigars?

57:04.173 --> 57:08.376
You know, Rosamund wants to take you
to the theater. Oh, I don't think so.

57:08.377 --> 57:12.732
Oh, no. I'm too tired for an evening
of second-hand emotion.

57:12.733 --> 57:17.987
Oh, me too. One outing's enough.
I'd rather stay in and play cards.

57:17.988 --> 57:20.539
Oh, poker's not your game.

57:20.540 --> 57:24.202
I hope you don't mind playing on
your first night here. Not at all.

57:24.203 --> 57:26.546
Then we'll sit and talk
and leave the men to it.

57:26.547 --> 57:30.599
So it doesn't strike you as odd?
No, not really. Well, not very.

57:30.600 --> 57:34.213
And Mary's men, why are they coming?
Don't call them Mary's men.

57:34.214 --> 57:37.657
They're coming for cards, Mama,
except for Charles Blake.

57:37.658 --> 57:40.661
He doesn't play.
That is, he won't play tonight.

57:40.662 --> 57:44.115
We could play a different game.
Oh, no, he has to go out.

57:44.116 --> 57:48.019
He's taking Mary and me to see
a show. Not a very long show.

57:48.020 --> 57:51.922
I wish you'd say what's going on.

57:51.923 --> 57:55.375
Well, now, Isis, old girl.
Are you happy to be in London?

57:55.376 --> 57:58.270
She's happy to see you.
I was no substitute.

58:01.383 --> 58:05.736
Whoa! Well, the gang's all here,
I see.

58:05.737 --> 58:09.492
Is that American for hello?

58:09.493 --> 58:12.796
Harold, I don't believe
you've met Tom, Sybil's husband.

58:12.797 --> 58:15.797
It seems strange we never met
when she was here to introduce us.

58:15.798 --> 58:18.650
Well, I'm glad to know you now.

58:18.651 --> 58:22.256
How curious these phrases are!
Could we get some tea?

58:22.257 --> 58:23.627
With milk?

58:24.508 --> 58:28.561
Well, I hope you enjoyed our picnic.
Of course we did.

58:28.562 --> 58:32.765
Even if the combination of open-air
picnics and after-dinner poker

58:32.766 --> 58:36.219
make me feel as though I've fallen
through a looking-glass

58:36.220 --> 58:38.771
into the Dejeuner Sur L'Herbe.

58:38.772 --> 58:41.023
It's lucky you don't exaggerate,
Mama.

58:41.024 --> 58:46.729
Poker after dinner?
There's a message from Rosamund
that she's taking us to the theater.

58:46.730 --> 58:50.484
Not us - you. Why have I been
selected for this honor?

58:50.485 --> 58:53.187
She was complaining
she doesn't see enough of you.

58:53.188 --> 58:55.566
Enough for what?

58:57.693 --> 59:02.376
Well, if I'm going to the theater,
then I ought to change.

59:04.309 --> 59:06.189
Yes. I should.

59:11.083 --> 59:13.775
Have you heard from Alfred again?
Why would we?

59:13.776 --> 59:16.252
Don't suppose he can be bothered
with us now, cooking for film stars
and the crowned heads of Europe.

59:16.253 --> 59:18.731
I'll crown you if you don't get that
back on the heat.

59:18.732 --> 59:21.583
No, but he's escaped, hasn't he?
Escaped from what?

59:21.584 --> 59:25.038
Well, you know - ordinary life.

59:25.039 --> 59:28.856
Oh!

59:44.868 --> 59:47.561
Before you go in, My Lord.
What is it?

59:47.562 --> 59:52.366
I wasn't sure whether to tell you
but I was put in charge of Downton
when you left.

59:52.367 --> 59:54.919
Is something wrong? Not in that way.

59:54.920 --> 59:57.320
And you may think
it's not my business

59:57.321 --> 01:00:01.976
but when the family's honor is
concerned, My Lord,
it is my business.

01:00:01.977 --> 01:00:04.830
Go on. The other night
I was patrolling the galleries,

01:00:04.831 --> 01:00:07.682
making sure everything was
ship-shape before I turned in,

01:00:07.683 --> 01:00:10.985
when I ran into Mr. Branson
with a lady.

01:00:10.986 --> 01:00:14.739
Upstairs? Just as I said, My Lord.
On the bedroom gallery.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:17.292
What time was this? Oh, quite late.

01:00:17.293 --> 01:00:22.097
I can't say which room
they'd been in or if they'd been
in a room at all except...

01:00:22.098 --> 01:00:24.948
I don't know why else
they'd be up there.

01:00:24.949 --> 01:00:29.605
Anyway, they went downstairs and
he drove her back to the village.

01:00:29.606 --> 01:00:32.758
Who was this lady?
He said her name was Miss Bunting,

01:00:32.759 --> 01:00:34.410
a Miss Sarah Bunting.

01:00:34.411 --> 01:00:36.662
Of course, Mr. Branson is still
a young man

01:00:36.663 --> 01:00:40.716
and he can't be expected to stay
single all his life but even so...

01:00:40.717 --> 01:00:43.901
Thank you, Barrow.
Yes, My Lord.

01:00:47.023 --> 01:00:50.177
Do we have anything I can take up
some ice in? Why do you need ice?

01:00:50.178 --> 01:00:53.630
Mr. Levinson seems to want it
in everything he drinks.

01:00:53.631 --> 01:00:57.384
Er, I'm glad you're all here.

01:00:57.385 --> 01:01:00.086
I have something
I want to tell you.

01:01:00.087 --> 01:01:04.780
Her Ladyship wants to give us all
a day out while we're in the south.

01:01:05.344 --> 01:01:09.697
I've been thinking
a visit to the Science Museum.

01:01:09.698 --> 01:01:13.980
Or perhaps to see where they've put
the Crystal Palace!

01:01:13.981 --> 01:01:18.405
Then there's the Royal Institution.

01:01:18.406 --> 01:01:22.008
Or the Natural History Museum.

01:01:22.009 --> 01:01:27.115
Of course, Westminster Abbey is
always a good day out.

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:29.992
Well, I'm sure we'll come up
with something.

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:35.579
Erm... Could I have that ice?

01:01:37.477 --> 01:01:41.079
Mrs. Hughes, did you get rid
of that old coat?

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.284
I did. They were very grateful.
We should tell that to Mr. Bates.

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:50.087
I took it without saying and
he hadn't gone through the pockets.

01:01:50.088 --> 01:01:53.391
There was nothing in them,
was there?

01:01:53.393 --> 01:01:57.898
Nothing that matters now.
Well, that's a funny answer.

01:01:57.899 --> 01:02:01.946
Can I help you, Miss Baxter?
No, no.

01:02:08.709 --> 01:02:11.223
I hope Daisy gave you my message.

01:02:12.464 --> 01:02:15.166
She did, yes.
So what's going on?

01:02:15.167 --> 01:02:18.767
I know you. There's something.

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:24.175
Are you free, Miss Baxter? I've a
book I've been meaning to show you.

01:02:24.176 --> 01:02:25.995
Thank you, Mr. Molesley.

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:33.290
What was it you wanted to say?
You must promise
not to answer straightaway.

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:40.242
Not to answer what? Mr. Levinson
wants you to come to America
to cook for him.

01:02:40.243 --> 01:02:44.146
We'll be touring Europe for a month.
You have plenty of time to decide.

01:02:44.147 --> 01:02:48.500
Then, if you agree,
he'll send you the fare
and I'll meet you in New York.

01:02:48.501 --> 01:02:50.526
Are you serious? He says he'll be
teased for hiring an English cook

01:02:50.527 --> 01:02:55.859
but he loves your food - he does.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.471
That's not what I were expecting.

01:03:09.824 --> 01:03:15.227
Terribly out of practice.
Haven't played since Downton.

01:03:15.228 --> 01:03:17.931
It's rather sad poor Mr. Gregson
won't be joining us.

01:03:17.932 --> 01:03:20.633
You've heard about that?
Everyone has.

01:03:20.634 --> 01:03:24.087
It's quite a mystery
but I confess to a certain relief

01:03:24.089 --> 01:03:25.889
he won't be at the table tonight.

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:28.142
Did he give you a difficult time
of it?

01:03:28.143 --> 01:03:31.595
To be honest, I wasn't sure he was
playing strictly according to Hoyle

01:03:31.596 --> 01:03:34.598
but we'll leave it,
since the poor chap's missing.

01:03:34.599 --> 01:03:38.052
I hope we can trust everyone
at the table tonight.

01:03:38.053 --> 01:03:42.107
I'm disappointed. I was rather hoping
to find Mrs. Levinson here.

01:03:42.108 --> 01:03:45.709
I'm sure you were.

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:49.901
I gather you've been entertaining
in our absence.

01:03:49.902 --> 01:03:55.646
Have I? Barrow mentioned a friend of
yours came up for dinner one night.

01:03:55.647 --> 01:04:01.375
Not for dinner but I brought her
to the house after dinner.

01:04:02.703 --> 01:04:07.958
After dinner?
She... wanted to have a look.

01:04:07.959 --> 01:04:11.587
We ought to concentrate or Sampson
will have his way with us.

01:04:19.358 --> 01:04:21.911
This is so kind of you.

01:04:21.912 --> 01:04:24.463
Sorry to hear that Mr. Sampson was
taken ill, miss.

01:04:24.464 --> 01:04:28.201
I'm sure it isn't serious but
we do need to gather some things.

01:04:28.818 --> 01:04:32.254
Let me know when you're done and
I'll come and lock up. Thank you!

01:04:41.903 --> 01:04:46.311
It's rather sad to see the truth
behind Mr. Sampson's smooth facade.

01:04:46.312 --> 01:04:49.826
Cheating at cards can't be
very lucrative after all.
Never mind that.

01:04:49.827 --> 01:04:53.268
Charles, you take the desk,
and, Mary, we'll search the bedroom.

01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:55.653
They say men hide things
in their sock drawer.

01:04:55.654 --> 01:04:57.945
Why's that, do you think?
It's a deterrent.

01:04:57.946 --> 01:05:01.685
What could be more revolting
than rummaging through
a strange man's socks? Ugh!

01:05:03.355 --> 01:05:06.141
You're very thoughtful, Miss Baxter.

01:05:07.259 --> 01:05:08.614
Am I?

01:05:11.161 --> 01:05:14.164
It's no use ganging up
with Mr. Molesley.

01:05:14.165 --> 01:05:19.271
He can't protect you like I can.
And he doesn't know what I know,
does he?

01:05:19.272 --> 01:05:22.622
He knows how to be kind, Mr. Barrow.

01:05:22.623 --> 01:05:25.973
He has the advantage of you there.

01:05:26.328 --> 01:05:30.082
Erm, mine, I believe. Sorry!

01:05:30.083 --> 01:05:32.864
Oh, so you do have the cards!
I must play more!

01:05:33.237 --> 01:05:36.273
You said Sampson would
have the trick of it.

01:05:36.274 --> 01:05:38.341
I haven't had a hand all night.

01:05:38.342 --> 01:05:41.193
Gentlemen, have we had enough?
Surely not.

01:05:41.194 --> 01:05:44.689
We've only just begun.
No. No, I think that's it.

01:05:49.454 --> 01:05:53.656
I gather we've failed to protect
the Prince from his recklessness?

01:05:53.657 --> 01:05:57.710
So now the press
will go to town. I'm afraid so.

01:05:57.711 --> 01:06:02.217
But I daresay his lack of judgment
would have tripped him up
sooner or later.

01:06:02.218 --> 01:06:06.053
Rather gloomy for a monarchist.
I'm a realist monarchist.

01:06:07.021 --> 01:06:09.973
I think someone's waiting for you.

01:06:13.179 --> 01:06:16.481
I should be off.
I'm so grateful - really.

01:06:16.482 --> 01:06:20.684
Well, if it does all blow up, I hope
he finds out how hard we tried.

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:23.538
I can't be sad, though. No?

01:06:23.539 --> 01:06:26.089
You were in trouble
and you called on me.

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:30.445
It seems a very positive step,
which I'd like to see repeated
immediately, if possible.

01:06:30.446 --> 01:06:34.951
Must I be in trouble again so soon?
I mean it, Mary.

01:06:34.952 --> 01:06:36.571
Give me a chance.

01:06:37.204 --> 01:06:42.457
Are you sure? My lot's going down
and your lot's coming up.

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:45.311
Is that a receipt
for a peaceful coexistence?

01:06:45.312 --> 01:06:49.335
I wouldn't put it like that.
I'd say I believe in the future.

01:06:49.336 --> 01:06:50.766
And so could you.

01:06:52.819 --> 01:06:54.236
I'd better go.

01:06:56.273 --> 01:06:58.265
I'll see you at the ball.

01:07:00.779 --> 01:07:04.981
Mr. Bates, Lady Rose is back
and she asked me to tell you

01:07:04.982 --> 01:07:06.932
that the note worked

01:07:06.933 --> 01:07:10.387
but they couldn't find
what they were looking for,
whatever that means.

01:07:10.388 --> 01:07:15.944
What does it mean?
James, when they leave
I'll need a hand with the coats.

01:07:15.945 --> 01:07:21.577
I'd like to help, Mr. Carson.
Oh, that would be appreciated.
Thank you.

01:07:23.001 --> 01:07:26.454
So, from tomorrow,
it's full speed ahead for the ball.

01:07:26.455 --> 01:07:29.757
Could we tell them about the outing,
to keep their spirits up?

01:07:29.758 --> 01:07:34.862
Have you had any further thoughts?
Well, I was wondering if we might
go for something more obvious.

01:07:34.864 --> 01:07:37.114
Madame Tussaud's, perhaps.

01:07:37.115 --> 01:07:41.620
There are interesting
historical figures to be seen there
and not just sensational ones.

01:07:41.621 --> 01:07:43.036
Are there?

01:07:47.177 --> 01:07:48.977
Are you all right, my darling?

01:07:48.978 --> 01:07:51.980
I never know what's going on
inside that head of yours,

01:07:51.981 --> 01:07:54.234
not these days.

01:07:54.235 --> 01:07:58.738
But you do know I would never do
anything to hurt you, don't you?

01:07:58.739 --> 01:08:04.292
What an extraordinary thing to say!
Extraordinary or not, it's true.

01:08:04.293 --> 01:08:08.008
Whatever I may do,
it would never be to hurt you.

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:10.892
Good night, Papa.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:15.314
Do you mean we've all been kept
in the dark for nothing?

01:08:15.315 --> 01:08:18.466
I'm afraid so.
Kept in the dark about what?

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:24.174
Oh, just, some romantic scheme.
Nothing more.

01:08:24.175 --> 01:08:26.575
Might it concern
my old friend Aysgarth,

01:08:26.576 --> 01:08:30.179
who came here to see
a certain lady from across the seas?

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:35.843
A certain lady destined to go back
across the seas with any luck.

01:08:36.336 --> 01:08:39.939
Lady Grantham, I'm very touched
by your generosity to me.

01:08:39.941 --> 01:08:42.644
I know we English don't speak
of such things

01:08:42.645 --> 01:08:44.594
but I won't forget it.

01:08:44.595 --> 01:08:46.545
That's quite all right.

01:08:46.546 --> 01:08:49.554
Good night.
Good night.

01:08:49.555 --> 01:08:53.770
It was nice of you to come tonight,
after our conversation earlier.

01:08:54.613 --> 01:08:56.669
I hope you'll be at the ball.

01:08:57.158 --> 01:08:59.108
Why wouldn't I be?

01:09:00.158 --> 01:09:01.517
Good.

01:09:03.654 --> 01:09:07.606
I expect you'll have another game
tomorrow. How well you know me.
Thank you.

01:09:07.608 --> 01:09:11.975
Which is Mr. Sampson's?
I have it here. Thank you, Mr.
Carson.

01:09:11.975 --> 01:09:14.225
Don't you ever get tired of it?
It's a lucrative game.

01:09:14.227 --> 01:09:17.158
Thanks. Did you talk to Mr. Levinson?

01:09:22.384 --> 01:09:23.947
There we are, sir.

01:09:27.033 --> 01:09:30.536
And there's no chance
of Mrs. Levinson...? Good night.

01:09:30.537 --> 01:09:32.777
I'm worn out, I'm worn out.

01:09:32.778 --> 01:09:37.981
I feel as if I've spent
the whole evening trapped
in the cast of a whodunit.

01:09:37.982 --> 01:09:41.059
Nobody's done it,
that's the problem.

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.081
Good night, Mama. Good night, dear.

01:09:44.499 --> 01:09:46.491
I beg your pardon, My Lord.

01:09:49.004 --> 01:09:50.361
What's this?

01:09:51.122 --> 01:09:53.060
It occurred to me, My Lord,

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:56.009
that were I in possession
of a very sensitive document,

01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:58.615
I would not leave it unguarded
in my home

01:09:58.616 --> 01:10:01.412
but rather, I would take it with me
wherever I went.

01:10:01.413 --> 01:10:04.845
So I helped a gentleman
on with his coat.

01:10:05.377 --> 01:10:10.119
He left it in his overcoat?
It was in his inside breast pocket

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.162
and now it is safely in your hands.

01:10:12.163 --> 01:10:14.093
I'll see you upstairs, My Lord.

01:10:25.292 --> 01:10:28.649
I don't believe it! How?

01:10:28.651 --> 01:10:33.811
Mr. Sampson appears to have
dropped it and Bates picked it up.

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:36.167
He dropped it? Aren't we fortunate?

01:10:36.168 --> 01:10:38.245
Fortunate is one word for it.

01:11:15.198 --> 01:11:19.630
So it was a happy ending, My Lady?
A happy ending for the Prince.

01:11:19.631 --> 01:11:22.560
A crisis for the monarchy has been
averted,

01:11:22.561 --> 01:11:27.972
although given his character,
I wonder if we won't see another
before he's finished.

01:11:27.973 --> 01:11:31.080
But the next one won't be the fault
of the Crawley family.

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:35.657
But seriously,
we are so much in Bates' debt.

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:39.379
I'll thank him in the morning
but would you tell him
how grateful we are?

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:41.662
He'll be glad to have been of use,
My Lady.

01:11:41.663 --> 01:11:45.543
He's very loyal to the family
but you already know that.

01:11:45.544 --> 01:11:49.140
I do and the family is loyal to him.

01:11:49.141 --> 01:11:50.495
To both of you.

01:13:46.565 --> 01:13:48.326
We should start the dancing

01:13:48.327 --> 01:13:51.361
and I think it would be nice
if you began it with Rose.

01:13:51.362 --> 01:13:54.178
Family duty comes in many forms.

01:13:55.273 --> 01:13:56.891
Wait a minute. What's this?

01:14:04.364 --> 01:14:08.160
Lady Grantham,
I know we're just crashers
and we haven't been invited -

01:14:08.161 --> 01:14:12.259
well, I haven't, anyway -
but we hoped you wouldn't mind.

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.625
You honor this house
with your presence, sir.

01:14:14.627 --> 01:14:16.773
I don't know if the dancing has
started yet

01:14:16.774 --> 01:14:19.942
but perhaps His Royal Highness
and Rose could...?

01:14:19.943 --> 01:14:22.395
Would you permit me
to open the ball?

01:14:56.535 --> 01:14:59.599
If she isn't a darling of London
society after a kick-off like this,

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.531
it won't be his fault.

01:15:14.773 --> 01:15:16.440
Are you glad you came?

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:19.214
I mean, these are your people now.

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:21.560
You must remember that.
This is your family.
This may be my family

01:15:21.561 --> 01:15:27.900
but these are not quite my people.
That sounds like a challenge.
Does it?

01:15:28.505 --> 01:15:30.193
Well, here's another.

01:15:30.194 --> 01:15:35.013
Would you like to dance?
Oh! Well... are you sure?

01:15:35.867 --> 01:15:38.181
Well, then, I accept the challenge.

01:15:38.182 --> 01:15:41.049
I know... I know I can trust you
to steer.

01:15:44.084 --> 01:15:48.192
How did you manage this?
I told him in his whole life

01:15:48.193 --> 01:15:51.769
he'd never owed more to anyone
than he does to Rose.

01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:54.740
And did you tell him why?
Certainly not.

01:15:54.741 --> 01:15:58.944
But he trusts me
and he's a faithful little chap.

01:15:59.893 --> 01:16:01.832
So am I, Freda.

01:16:03.147 --> 01:16:05.252
Annoyingly, so am I.

01:16:11.529 --> 01:16:13.928
What do you mean, no?

01:16:13.929 --> 01:16:17.985
What do you think I mean?
It's not a very complicated word.

01:16:17.986 --> 01:16:23.781
Don't you want to be Lady Aysgarth
and rank alongside your daughter?

01:16:23.782 --> 01:16:26.493
Lord Aysgarth, I'm modern.

01:16:27.131 --> 01:16:30.299
I don't hanker for those days
before the war.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.907
And I don't really want to spend
the rest of my life

01:16:33.908 --> 01:16:39.306
among people who think me loud
and opinionated and common.

01:16:39.308 --> 01:16:42.686
But I assure you, they wouldn't.
Ah, yes, they would.

01:16:42.687 --> 01:16:44.115
And, you know, they'd be right

01:16:44.116 --> 01:16:48.548
because I think
THEY are narrow and pompous

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:50.768
and boring.

01:16:51.925 --> 01:16:54.323
Well, then, why did you encourage me?

01:16:54.324 --> 01:16:57.462
Because I thought that it would add
to the fun of the trip.

01:16:57.463 --> 01:16:59.393
And I was right.

01:17:00.123 --> 01:17:02.917
So, why don't you come
and visit Newport

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.838
and I will rustle up...
old rich widows

01:17:07.839 --> 01:17:11.155
who want titles much more than I do?

01:17:12.041 --> 01:17:14.085
Wouldn't that call it quits?

01:17:17.152 --> 01:17:23.417
This is not me. London has remade me
in a different image.

01:17:23.793 --> 01:17:27.880
Maybe London has released you
to be seen as you really are.

01:17:27.881 --> 01:17:30.229
Ah, Miss Allsopp - Madeleine.

01:17:32.449 --> 01:17:34.888
And please don't think too harshly
of us.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.962
Father is frightened.

01:17:37.963 --> 01:17:40.248
You see, he doesn't know how to live
without money. Ah!

01:17:41.322 --> 01:17:45.357
Well, thank you for your honesty.
I'm only sorry I couldn't help.

01:17:45.358 --> 01:17:48.235
You have helped.
I won't play his game again

01:17:48.236 --> 01:17:50.529
and you're the one
I have to thank for that. Hmm.

01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:54.991
But now I'm going to help you.
I'm flattered you should want to.

01:17:54.992 --> 01:17:56.609
There you go again!

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:06.107
You say you're only fit
for good-time girls
who see a profit in friendship.

01:18:06.108 --> 01:18:10.216
And you don't agree, huh?
I know that any woman,
no matter who she was,

01:18:10.217 --> 01:18:13.053
would be lucky to claim you
as her husband.

01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:18.297
You're kind, clever,
and much too modest.

01:18:18.298 --> 01:18:22.384
And I speak without guile because
I know you have escaped my net.

01:18:22.385 --> 01:18:23.741
Thank you.

01:18:27.277 --> 01:18:31.134
When do you go?
We get the boat train Friday.

01:18:31.623 --> 01:18:36.973
Hmm. But you'll pleased to hear
I'm going to hire an English cook.

01:18:37.924 --> 01:18:40.540
My valet appears
to have recruited one.

01:18:46.463 --> 01:18:49.998
Will you write?
Tell me how things are going?

01:18:50.999 --> 01:18:54.336
Madeleine? I should be delighted...

01:18:55.942 --> 01:18:57.527
..Harold.

01:18:59.352 --> 01:19:02.480
Can we stop without my having
to hand you over to someone else?

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:04.700
Let's hide.

01:19:12.074 --> 01:19:15.951
Are you enjoying yourself? It's
exciting to see the Prince of Wales.

01:19:15.952 --> 01:19:18.924
We're going to watch from
the basement steps when he leaves.

01:19:21.542 --> 01:19:23.658
I don't know
what Mr. Barrow's got over you

01:19:23.659 --> 01:19:25.023
and I don't want to know

01:19:25.024 --> 01:19:27.933
but he mustn't make you do things
that aren't right

01:19:27.934 --> 01:19:30.113
and you can't let him bully you.

01:19:30.623 --> 01:19:33.137
That's easy to say.
I know.

01:19:33.511 --> 01:19:37.955
But if he draws you
into his schemes, that's not going
to be easy for you either.

01:19:39.737 --> 01:19:43.553
Sometimes, it's better to, you know,
take a risk

01:19:43.554 --> 01:19:46.588
than to go down the wrong path -
that's all.

01:19:47.903 --> 01:19:51.363
Are you taking this or should I
carry it up to the ballroom myself?

01:19:51.364 --> 01:19:52.721
Sorry.

01:19:57.371 --> 01:20:00.519
I gather it turned out well
the other night after all.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.822
That's why the Prince came
to open the ball.

01:20:02.823 --> 01:20:04.179
I'm glad.

01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:09.781
Is there any progress on whether
it's going to turn out well for me?

01:20:10.886 --> 01:20:13.116
Oh, Tony, I wish I knew.

01:20:13.117 --> 01:20:18.632
I feel so cruel,
dangling you and Charles and
even Evelyn on the end of a string.

01:20:19.582 --> 01:20:24.265
You didn't refuse Charles either?
I tried but he wouldn't have it.

01:20:24.588 --> 01:20:26.422
Are you sure it's not him?

01:20:27.536 --> 01:20:31.446
My destiny is to save Downton
for George

01:20:31.447 --> 01:20:36.089
by spending every penny and every
waking minute holding it together.

01:20:37.037 --> 01:20:41.896
Yes. Charles is on the other side
of that struggle.

01:20:42.261 --> 01:20:46.161
He's an outsider who resents
the very people I come from.

01:20:46.755 --> 01:20:50.020
Even if he loves me,
how can we pull as team?

01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:55.390
Of course, I should sing and dance
to hear you say that

01:20:55.932 --> 01:20:59.831
but you seem to have got
the wrong end of the stick
with Charles.

01:20:59.832 --> 01:21:03.345
What do you mean? Charles is
the heir to his father's cousin,

01:21:03.346 --> 01:21:05.119
Sir Severus Blake.

01:21:05.964 --> 01:21:10.781
He is to inherit the baronetcy on
one of the largest estates in Ulster.

01:21:10.782 --> 01:21:12.136
Charles?

01:21:13.419 --> 01:21:16.650
But if that were true,
surely I would have heard of him?

01:21:16.651 --> 01:21:19.956
Well, Sir Severus is
a distant relation

01:21:19.957 --> 01:21:24.575
and Charles has always played it down
but he is not an outsider.

01:21:25.004 --> 01:21:30.289
In fact, he's going to be
a lot more eligible than I am.

01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:34.150
Why did no-one tell me this before?
Does it make a difference?

01:21:34.151 --> 01:21:38.008
To know that he and I are
on the same side, yes,
of course it makes a difference.

01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:41.249
You sound as though
the tide is running against me.

01:21:42.929 --> 01:21:44.285
Tony...

01:21:45.171 --> 01:21:49.707
A year ago,
I thought I'd be alone for ever.

01:21:50.886 --> 01:21:54.701
That I would mourn Matthew
to the end of my days.

01:21:55.525 --> 01:21:57.674
Now I know that isn't true, that
there will be a new life for me,

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:02.566
one day.

01:22:03.505 --> 01:22:07.403
And even if I can't decide yet
what life that should be...

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:10.928
isn't it something
for us to celebrate?

01:22:17.611 --> 01:22:19.770
It certainly is.

01:22:28.123 --> 01:22:31.230
Oh, heavens. What is it?

01:22:31.231 --> 01:22:34.878
Lord Merton, and he seems
to be headed in this direction.

01:22:35.411 --> 01:22:39.854
Oh! No doubt to lead you down
the primrose path of dalliance.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:46.589
Mrs. Crawley, I hope you'll do me
the honor of dancing this waltz.

01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:48.800
I'm really not much of a dancer.

01:22:48.801 --> 01:22:51.616
Oh, nor I, so we're a perfect match.

01:22:52.147 --> 01:22:53.503
Well...

01:23:05.151 --> 01:23:06.840
Excuse me, please.

01:23:17.976 --> 01:23:22.751
So did you enjoy it, after all?
I enjoyed it fine.

01:23:24.275 --> 01:23:26.955
But we need to stand up to them,
you and I.

01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:30.635
We may love them

01:23:30.636 --> 01:23:32.439
but if we don't fight our corner,
they'll roll us out flat.

01:23:34.703 --> 01:23:36.350
You're right.

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:39.197
Thank you for that.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:52.365
I'm going home in the morning, Mama.
You don't mind, do you?

01:23:52.366 --> 01:23:54.910
Of course not. Is there a reason?

01:23:54.911 --> 01:23:56.559
Various reasons.

01:23:57.007 --> 01:23:59.094
I might go to the Continent.

01:23:59.417 --> 01:24:01.668
Not for long. Really?

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:04.357
Does it have anything
to do with Michael Gregson?

01:24:04.358 --> 01:24:06.839
It has everything to do
with Michael Gregson.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:10.688
Couldn't someone go for you?
I'm afraid not, Aunt Rosamund.

01:24:11.117 --> 01:24:13.775
I'm absolutely afraid not.

01:24:21.919 --> 01:24:23.899
Oh! Oh! Off to bed, are we?

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:27.903
Well, that's very sensible.
A woman your age needs her rest.

01:24:27.904 --> 01:24:33.795
You need a rest cure if you are
taken in by that booby Aysgarth.

01:24:33.796 --> 01:24:36.527
Violet, forgive me,
and I don't mean to be offensive,

01:24:36.528 --> 01:24:39.426
but are you always this stuck-up?

01:24:39.427 --> 01:24:41.147
Do tell me, do tell me -

01:24:41.148 --> 01:24:46.776
is the new Lady Aysgarth all set
to hold London enthralled

01:24:46.777 --> 01:24:48.821
with tales of how the West was won?

01:24:48.822 --> 01:24:52.127
Well, actually, I turned him down.
Oh!

01:24:52.128 --> 01:24:54.932
You surprise me.
Mm-hm. I'm sure.

01:24:54.933 --> 01:24:58.093
You see, I have no wish
to be a great lady. No.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.940
A decision that must be reinforced

01:25:02.941 --> 01:25:05.642
whenever you look in the glass.

01:25:09.094 --> 01:25:12.700
Violet, I don't mind
looking in the mirror

01:25:12.701 --> 01:25:18.206
because what I see is a woman
who's not afraid of the future.

01:25:18.207 --> 01:25:20.042
My world is coming nearer

01:25:20.043 --> 01:25:24.902
and your world, it's slipping
further and further away.

01:25:25.851 --> 01:25:27.205
Good night.

01:25:42.983 --> 01:25:46.892
Breakfast is done but there are
still quite a few in the ballroom.

01:25:46.893 --> 01:25:49.448
No, go to bed.
Take the others with you.

01:25:49.449 --> 01:25:53.504
I'll keep James and give him
the rest of the morning off.

01:25:53.505 --> 01:25:57.821
And what about you? It won't be the
first time I've gone without sleep.

01:25:57.822 --> 01:26:02.315
We ought to have the outing settled
if we're going on Thursday.

01:26:03.786 --> 01:26:05.142
Oh! I feel...

01:26:05.871 --> 01:26:08.676
a little guilty about that.

01:26:08.677 --> 01:26:13.763
I tried out my ideas on them and
I couldn't fire up any enthusiasm,

01:26:13.764 --> 01:26:18.676
so I wonder if we should just settle
for a day by the sea.

01:26:18.677 --> 01:26:22.816
I know it's a defeat
but what do you think?

01:26:22.817 --> 01:26:25.026
We could take the Pullman
from Victoria.

01:26:25.027 --> 01:26:27.581
A day-return ticket costs
12 shillings each.

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:30.948
It's a lot
but Her Ladyship's happy to pay.

01:26:30.949 --> 01:26:35.288
Well, thank heaven you got there
in the end.

01:26:43.046 --> 01:26:45.964
We've danced all night.
Your mother's gone to bed.

01:26:45.965 --> 01:26:48.979
Do congratulate her
on such a triumph. I will.

01:26:49.355 --> 01:26:53.785
Charles, why did you never tell me
about your cousin?

01:26:53.787 --> 01:26:57.196
Or the estate in Ulster
or any of it?

01:26:57.197 --> 01:26:58.854
I don't know, really.

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:03.827
At first, I wanted you not to assume
I shared your prejudices

01:27:03.828 --> 01:27:05.933
because I came
from a similar background.

01:27:05.934 --> 01:27:08.424
And later on? Later on?

01:27:08.425 --> 01:27:12.743
Later on, I think I wanted to win you
by myself, alone.

01:27:13.379 --> 01:27:17.623
Who told you? Evelyn? Well, I suppose
it could have been anyone.

01:27:17.624 --> 01:27:19.594
Tony Gillingham told me.
Oh.

01:27:20.054 --> 01:27:23.399
I thought it suited him for you
to think of me as an alien being.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.862
I think he wants it to be
a fair fight.

01:27:25.863 --> 01:27:28.531
Always assuming
we're the only two in the ring.

01:27:31.254 --> 01:27:32.734
So now...

01:27:34.099 --> 01:27:36.071
let battle commence?

01:27:37.854 --> 01:27:39.886
Let battle commence.

01:27:48.970 --> 01:27:51.128
Thank you. Just put it there.

01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:05.339
So if you go tomorrow, how long
would you be in Switzerland?

01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:09.656
Three or four days at the most.
So we've not got long to prepare.

01:28:09.657 --> 01:28:12.118
I will pay you for the first month
this afternoon

01:28:12.546 --> 01:28:16.925
but with three children,
you must have most
of the paraphernalia already.

01:28:17.353 --> 01:28:20.053
You're right. We won't need much.

01:28:20.054 --> 01:28:22.982
And you're quite sure your wife is
willing to take this on?

01:28:22.983 --> 01:28:25.601
Marjie dotes on children, My Lady.

01:28:26.655 --> 01:28:30.399
In fact, I'm not sure
we've had our last.

01:28:34.163 --> 01:28:36.227
She'll love it like her own.

01:28:38.218 --> 01:28:40.168
We'll need a decent story.

01:28:41.524 --> 01:28:46.540
That the parents are dead
and the mother was a friend of yours
or something

01:28:46.541 --> 01:28:48.584
and that's why you've taken her in.

01:28:48.585 --> 01:28:53.984
Well, that's true, except of course
it's my friend and not yours.

01:28:53.985 --> 01:28:58.439
But you don't want her here?
I can't have her here.

01:28:58.939 --> 01:29:02.766
My parents disapproved
of my friendship with her mother.

01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:06.758
They'd feel uncomfortable
for the baby to be in the house.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.356
I see.

01:29:11.253 --> 01:29:14.454
Which is why it has to be a secret.

01:29:16.509 --> 01:29:19.856
I hope I can make you understand
how important that is.

01:29:20.867 --> 01:29:23.057
I'll pay you whatever you want

01:29:23.965 --> 01:29:28.490
but it has to be a complete secret
from my family.

01:29:32.724 --> 01:29:34.580
I tell you what.

01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:39.856
I think it should be our secret,
My Lady.

01:29:40.836 --> 01:29:45.071
Ours and no-one else's.

01:29:46.541 --> 01:29:48.397
I'll er...

01:29:48.949 --> 01:29:51.044
send a letter to myself tonight

01:29:51.045 --> 01:29:55.549
and tell Marjie it's about
an old friend of mine who's died

01:29:55.550 --> 01:30:00.262
and asked for me to take the child.

01:30:03.505 --> 01:30:05.267
She won't question it.

01:30:06.217 --> 01:30:09.200
Then nobody but you and I will know.

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:12.066
Mr. Drewe, would you do that for me?

01:30:12.067 --> 01:30:14.298
For you and the little girl,
My Lady,

01:30:14.621 --> 01:30:18.021
yes, I will.

01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:23.391
How comforting it is
that there really are

01:30:23.392 --> 01:30:26.218
a few good people left in the world.

01:31:00.012 --> 01:31:02.274
I know you're hiding something
from me.

01:31:02.275 --> 01:31:05.530
I can tell.
No, I'm not.

01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:09.898
Don't make me act harshly,
Miss Baxter, because you know I can.

01:31:09.899 --> 01:31:13.098
You must do as you think best,
Mr. Barrow,

01:31:13.631 --> 01:31:15.591
just as I must.

01:31:22.338 --> 01:31:26.498
I have to thank you, Mr. Molesley.
Oh? Why's that?

01:31:27.594 --> 01:31:31.648
There are things in my past
that have made me afraid

01:31:31.649 --> 01:31:33.007
but...

01:31:34.206 --> 01:31:36.385
I'm not afraid any more.

01:31:37.125 --> 01:31:39.741
I'm not sure what will happen
but whatever it is,

01:31:39.742 --> 01:31:42.339
it's better than being afraid.

01:31:43.965 --> 01:31:46.958
You've made me strong, Mr. Molesley.

01:31:47.417 --> 01:31:51.661
Your strength has made me strong.

01:31:52.371 --> 01:31:53.955
My what?

01:31:55.528 --> 01:31:58.927
What time do you go tomorrow?
The train leaves at ten.

01:31:58.928 --> 01:32:02.276
I reckon Spain and Italy may be
pretty hot,

01:32:02.277 --> 01:32:05.507
so when you see me again -
No, no.

01:32:05.508 --> 01:32:08.053
I won't be coming to America.

01:32:08.773 --> 01:32:10.815
Don't make a decision too -
I'm not coming.

01:32:10.816 --> 01:32:14.288
But thank you.
And please thank Mr. Levinson.

01:32:15.644 --> 01:32:19.700
You know why I asked you?
I think I do, yes.

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:22.485
I didn't say it because I thought
it might frighten you off.

01:32:24.654 --> 01:32:26.706
But we could make a go of it.

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:32.443
Daisy? I suspect
we want different things, Mr. Slade.

01:32:32.444 --> 01:32:37.199
But it means that much to me
to hear you say it. Thank you.

01:32:38.783 --> 01:32:41.681
Could I try? Try what?

01:32:41.682 --> 01:32:45.770
To cook for Mr. Levinson. I know all
the dishes Daisy makes, I promise.

01:32:45.771 --> 01:32:48.980
Yes, but it would have worked
with Daisy in New York -

01:32:48.981 --> 01:32:51.537
If Mr. Levinson likes her style
of cooking...

01:32:53.182 --> 01:32:56.050
Please. Give me a trial.

01:32:56.051 --> 01:32:58.614
I'll save up and pay my own way out
if I have to.

01:32:58.616 --> 01:33:03.829
Let her come! You've told him
you've got an English cook
and he won't know the difference.

01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:07.342
OK. I'll cable
when I get back to New York

01:33:07.343 --> 01:33:10.410
and you won't have to pay
for your ticket.

01:33:10.755 --> 01:33:13.673
But I warn you -
he can be quite picky.

01:33:13.674 --> 01:33:16.656
Don't worry. This is my chance.

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:19.013
I swear I won't let you down.

01:33:27.271 --> 01:33:29.565
That were kind of you, Daisy.

01:33:29.566 --> 01:33:32.600
Why shouldn't she go to America
if it's what she wants?

01:33:32.601 --> 01:33:35.831
You're not upset, then,
by Mr. Slade making advances?

01:33:35.832 --> 01:33:37.188
Upset?

01:33:38.085 --> 01:33:40.941
Mrs. Patmore,
if you knew what it feels like

01:33:40.942 --> 01:33:44.540
to have a young man keen
to court me...

01:33:44.541 --> 01:33:47.720
I'd kiss him if it wouldn't give him
the wrong idea.

01:33:48.148 --> 01:33:52.619
Upset? I'm that chuffed,
it'll take me through
to next summer.

01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:59.097
Did I ever tell you how glad
they were to get that coat
for the Russian refugees?

01:33:59.723 --> 01:34:01.077
Poor souls.

01:34:02.153 --> 01:34:05.664
I just wish you'd let me go through
the pockets first, that's all.

01:34:05.665 --> 01:34:07.627
I'm sorry.

01:34:08.263 --> 01:34:11.902
Is there anything I can do
to make up for it?

01:34:14.268 --> 01:34:16.094
Let me think.

01:34:17.878 --> 01:34:20.358
You could always buy me a penny lick.

01:34:34.091 --> 01:34:36.793
Come on - I dare you.

01:34:37.251 --> 01:34:39.251
But if get my trousers wet...

01:34:39.252 --> 01:34:41.736
If you get them wet, we'll dry them.

01:34:42.351 --> 01:34:45.509
Suppose I fall over?
Suppose a bomb goes off,

01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:48.283
suppose we're hit by a falling star?

01:34:48.284 --> 01:34:51.881
You can hold my hand,
then we'll both go in together.

01:34:52.266 --> 01:34:54.810
I think I will hold your hand.

01:34:54.811 --> 01:34:58.126
It'll make me feel a bit steadier.

01:34:58.127 --> 01:35:01.421
You can always hold my hand
if you need to feel steady.

01:35:02.475 --> 01:35:07.876
I don't know how but you managed
to make that sound a little risque.

01:35:10.129 --> 01:35:12.069
And if I did?

01:35:14.332 --> 01:35:16.741
We're getting on, Mr. Carson,
you and I.

01:35:16.742 --> 01:35:19.649
We can afford to live a little.
