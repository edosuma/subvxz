WEBVTT

00:18.727 --> 00:19.853
[chuckles]

00:24.858 --> 00:27.569
-Do you have any ice cream?
-Ice cream?

00:27.652 --> 00:28.528
Yeah.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.822
You always have ice cream in here.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.908
Um, I guess, in the freezer.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.870
[woman] Yes! It's so good to see you, Mom.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.123
Want some?

00:40.206 --> 00:41.124
I'm okay.

00:42.042 --> 00:42.876
Thanks.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.919
Okay. Suit yourself.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.922
Today has been the worst day.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.549
I came all this way, and I…

00:50.884 --> 00:53.136
I can't believe
he reacted like that. [sighs]

00:53.219 --> 00:54.179
I mean, I can.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.639
He's Lucifer, but…

00:57.223 --> 00:59.809
Wait, are you the girl
from Lucifer's penthouse?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.144
His daughter?

01:02.979 --> 01:04.314
And yours, Mom.

01:04.939 --> 01:06.816
[chuckles] I'm--

01:06.900 --> 01:08.985
I'm sorry, you keep calling me Mom,

01:09.069 --> 01:11.321
but, um, I only have one daughter.

01:11.946 --> 01:12.989
Her name is Trixie,

01:13.615 --> 01:16.910
and, um, it would be quite hard
to miss a pregnancy.

01:16.993 --> 01:19.954
I mean,
I-- I'm not trying to be rude, but, um…

01:20.538 --> 01:22.165
Right. Yeah, of course.

01:22.248 --> 01:23.917
Yeah. [chuckles]

01:24.000 --> 01:26.628
Come on, Rory, this sounds frickin' crazy.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.671
Sorry. I just-- I felt…

01:28.755 --> 01:30.006
I just felt so lost,

01:30.090 --> 01:33.426
and I thought
that coming home would maybe…

01:34.552 --> 01:36.596
I don't… I don't know. Never mind.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.307
I shouldn't have done this.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.975
I will go.

01:41.059 --> 01:44.395
Wait, hold on.
Uh, what did you say your name was?

01:44.979 --> 01:45.939
Rory.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.566
-Short for "Aurora."
-Aurora.

01:51.069 --> 01:54.072
If I ever had another daughter,

01:54.155 --> 01:56.324
that's what I was gonna name her.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.742
Aurora.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.578
I've never told anybody that before.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.791
Are you really my daughter?

02:05.917 --> 02:07.544
I don't understand. I…

02:08.253 --> 02:09.254
[gasps]

02:14.342 --> 02:16.427
[sobbing softly]

02:19.180 --> 02:21.599
I can't imagine what you're going through,

02:22.433 --> 02:24.727
or how any of this is possible.

02:25.311 --> 02:28.398
-It's complicated, Mom.
-[both chuckle]

02:34.737 --> 02:36.114
[Dan] Are you done yet?

02:36.197 --> 02:38.408
Can we hang already, please? [chuckles]

02:38.491 --> 02:40.368
Dan, how long have you been--

02:40.451 --> 02:42.912
[sighs] You know what? Never mind.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.207
[sighs] My final exam is tomorrow, man.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.417
I have to study.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.669
Ah, come on, man. You're gonna ace it!

02:49.752 --> 02:51.588
-Take it from a seasoned cop.
-[sighs]

02:51.671 --> 02:55.758
Look, you've already learned everything
you're gonna learn from the manual.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.677
What you need to do

02:58.720 --> 03:00.263
is focus on your weak spots.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.431
-Weak spots?
-Yeah.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.892
-What weak spots?
-No offense, man. It's just…

03:03.975 --> 03:06.853
Look, I'm saying, there's book smart
and then there's street smart.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.814
For example, how do you make sure

03:09.898 --> 03:12.442
that you get
all the good assignments at roll call?

03:12.525 --> 03:15.069
Aren't they all just assignments?

03:15.153 --> 03:16.696
[Dan whispering] No.

03:17.906 --> 03:22.202
You sneak Sergeant Kennedy
a corned beef on rye the day before,

03:22.285 --> 03:25.872
and I have no idea why I'm whispering
'cause no one can hear me.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.665
[chuckles] Oh!

03:27.749 --> 03:29.709
[normal voice]
And you gotta avoid squad car 23

03:29.792 --> 03:32.462
because they never fixed the transmission.
That's important.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.756
I know you're just trying to help.
Buddy, I really do.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.675
But I'm gonna figure
these things out on my own.

03:37.759 --> 03:38.593
Yeah.

03:38.676 --> 03:42.597
But isn't it easier and way more fun
to pick my brain? Huh? Huh?

03:42.680 --> 03:44.265
Say, over a couple of beers?

03:44.349 --> 03:46.893
You drink, and I try to remember
what the buzz felt like? [laughs]

03:46.976 --> 03:48.728
I would like that, Dan. I really would.

03:48.811 --> 03:51.773
But right now you have to leave

03:51.856 --> 03:54.275
because you're making me look crazy.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.780
Oh, right. You see,
it's the whole "not having a body" thing.

03:58.863 --> 04:02.325
It's hard, you know? I wanna feel
like I can… [inhales] …do something.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.494
-You know?
-Mm-hmm.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.454
[Dan clears throat]

04:07.914 --> 04:10.917
[chuckles] Study up, my man.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.085
We'll talk later.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.630
But, uh, don't forget…

04:15.713 --> 04:16.923
Corned beef on rye!

04:17.006 --> 04:17.966
That's the one.

04:18.049 --> 04:20.718
Oh. Brown rice salmon sushi!

04:21.386 --> 04:23.429
Wait, who are we yelling lunch orders to?

04:24.639 --> 04:26.432
I, uh…

04:26.516 --> 04:28.434
Oh, Patterson from Records, right?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.770
Aww, it's so nice of him
to pick stuff up for us.

04:30.853 --> 04:32.855
Thanks, man. [clicks tongue]

04:32.939 --> 04:36.985
Anyway, I've got, um, something
crazy important I wanna talk to you about.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.279
-R-Really?
-Yeah.

04:39.362 --> 04:42.031
It's the most important
investigation of my life.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.326
Humungo. The mystery to end all mysteries.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.204
-Like, super-duper import--
-Ella! Just…

04:48.746 --> 04:50.039
Right.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.374
It's big, Amenadiel,

04:51.457 --> 04:55.003
and I've been waiting to tell someone
until I had a concrete clue,

04:55.086 --> 04:58.965
which I now do, so drum roll, please.

05:00.174 --> 05:01.884
I could just drum roll…

05:04.470 --> 05:05.805
My sock is missing.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.056
Your, um…

05:08.558 --> 05:09.475
-Your sock?
-Yep.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.353
Fourth time this month that
one of my socks has flown the coop,

05:12.437 --> 05:15.189
and I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, that's normal."

05:15.273 --> 05:17.942
"It happens to everyone,"
so just biz as uzhe, right?

05:18.985 --> 05:20.028
Wrong.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.782
I ran a data analysis
over a targeted search

05:24.866 --> 05:26.951
across several social media platforms

05:27.035 --> 05:31.080
and discovered a 7% uptick
in people mentioning missing socks.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.749
-Okay…
-But that's not all!

05:32.832 --> 05:35.668
A river in South America turned blood red.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.628
Plus, huh, raining frogs?

05:37.712 --> 05:39.714
I mean, it's, uh, it's pretty clear.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.300
The apocalypse is nigh.

05:42.967 --> 05:43.801
Ella…

05:45.136 --> 05:46.512
[sighs]

05:46.596 --> 05:50.600
The world is most assuredly not ending.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.771
Amenadiel, this is serious.

05:54.854 --> 05:58.066
We could have weeks, days, who knows?

05:58.149 --> 06:01.152
-I mean--
-There's a lot I don't fully understand.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.322
Like some
of the nonsensical laws in that textbook.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.575
But when it comes
to things of the cosmic nature,

06:07.658 --> 06:08.826
I'm pretty well versed,

06:08.910 --> 06:12.455
and if the world were ending,
I would feel it.

06:13.664 --> 06:14.582
Wait. Why?

06:14.665 --> 06:16.918
Why-- I mean, why would you feel it?

06:19.462 --> 06:20.546
[inhales]

06:20.630 --> 06:24.425
Well, I wouldn't feel it, you know.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.303
I would-- I would, uh,
I would know it, because…

06:27.387 --> 06:30.181
you know, I'm on the Internet a lot.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.975
I read everything.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.728
-Nerd alert! [laughs]
-[sighs] Right.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.438
Yeah. Of course.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.731
[both chuckle]

06:38.815 --> 06:40.983
Thanks for talking me off the ledge.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.615
Oh.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.576
[rock music plays]

06:55.915 --> 06:58.543
[hesitates] Time travel?

06:59.168 --> 07:00.044
[scoffs]

07:01.712 --> 07:03.089
Seriously?

07:04.048 --> 07:05.258
You're from the future.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.384
Well… [scoffs]

07:06.467 --> 07:08.761
I mean, you pull out people's desires.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.888
Amenadiel can slow down time.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.723
Is time travel that big of a stretch?

07:12.807 --> 07:15.143
I suppose, when you put it like that.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.603
[exhales] So…

07:18.354 --> 07:19.355
We have a daughter?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.941
[Chloe] Mm-hmm.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.568
-[sighs]
-[Chloe] Hmm.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.323
We have a daughter.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.492
Yeah.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.453
[gasps] It's amazing.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.204
-I know.
-[Lucifer gasps]

07:36.581 --> 07:37.999
[clears throat]

07:38.082 --> 07:41.711
I'd say "get a room,"
but well, clearly, you did.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.213
[laughs] Very good.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.841
[sighs] I'm not sure where to start.

07:46.924 --> 07:47.967
I, um…

07:49.218 --> 07:52.013
I owe you an apology, Rory,

07:52.096 --> 07:54.765
for how I reacted last time you were here.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.604
You caught me a little off guard,
what with the wing to the throat.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.314
[chuckling]

08:01.397 --> 08:03.774
Regardless, I am sorry.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.486
But if you're from the future

08:06.569 --> 08:07.904
and you're our child,

08:07.987 --> 08:09.739
then there must be some mistake.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.116
Why?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.577
Because I would never abandon you.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.414
I told you
coming here was a terrible idea.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.792
Lucifer, there's obviously
a reasonable explanation for this.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.128
No, I'm sorry. It's just not possible.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.213
I would never.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.591
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
I wouldn't be here if you hadn't.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.052
What does that mean?

08:33.095 --> 08:36.224
Before I traveled here, I was…

08:38.809 --> 08:42.897
I-- I was going through something big.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.192
And I thought…

08:47.109 --> 08:48.194
I felt like,

08:49.904 --> 08:52.782
if you were ever going to finally show up

08:52.865 --> 08:55.701
after being gone my whole life,

08:55.785 --> 08:58.246
it would be in that moment.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.623
But you didn't. [shudders]

09:02.416 --> 09:07.046
And then I felt this rush of pure rage.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.090
And then I was here.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.637
So you self-actualized.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.766
You manifested the ability
to travel back in time, because--

09:18.849 --> 09:22.061
Because of how much I hate you, yeah.
I told you I wanted to kill you.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.481
Apparently so much
that I traveled through time to do it.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.567
But yay me, I failed.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.236
[sighs] Thankfully.

09:31.028 --> 09:34.073
Ever since then,
I've been trying to get angry enough

09:34.156 --> 09:36.534
to go back to my time, but I can't, so…

09:38.286 --> 09:41.914
I guess my first jump through time
was a one-way trip.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.584
But maybe it's for the best.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.211
Now I get to see why you walk out on me.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.964
Would you stop saying that, please?

09:50.464 --> 09:53.259
I mean, yes, I suppose there's a chance

09:53.342 --> 09:56.387
that I could have neglected a daughter
I didn't know existed,

09:56.470 --> 09:58.431
but you're saying I do this knowingly?

09:58.514 --> 10:01.183
According to Mom,
you were well aware of my existence!

10:01.267 --> 10:03.519
The only thing
she wouldn't tell me was why you left.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.646
Well, who knows what she was hiding then?

10:05.730 --> 10:08.065
Maybe she's the one
you should be upset with!

10:08.149 --> 10:10.901
-[chuckles]
-Hey! I do not think that this is helping.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.237
She's accusing me
of something that would never happen.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.615
It did happen! It happened to me.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.199
I don't believe you!

10:17.283 --> 10:19.327
Lucifer. Enough.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.746
Rory, just give us a minute, okay?

10:21.829 --> 10:23.247
-Thank you. Please.
-[scoffs]

10:26.417 --> 10:29.295
[huffs] You need to calm down.

10:29.378 --> 10:30.421
She is hurting.

10:30.504 --> 10:33.674
She accused me of doing
the very thing my father did to me.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.093
[Chloe exhales]

10:37.011 --> 10:39.930
What if it's because you become God?

10:40.514 --> 10:41.807
No.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.060
No, no, my father chose to be distant.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.770
I would never choose this.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.524
I just can't think what would be powerful
enough to make me do something so…

10:51.859 --> 10:52.693
What?

10:54.028 --> 10:54.987
Oh, that's it.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.155
What's it?

10:56.238 --> 10:57.156
Azrael's blade.

10:57.823 --> 11:01.827
It's the only thing that can kill-kill me,
wipe me from existence.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.746
Someone must use it on me in the future.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.123
[snaps fingers]
And that is why I abandon her.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.834
Hmm. That could be an explanation.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.753
It's the only explanation.

11:11.587 --> 11:15.216
Which means there is a very simple
solution to this whole conundrum.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.551
-Which is?
-I return it to Heaven.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.596
My sister gets her knife back.
We avert a child abandonment issue.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.806
It's win-win. [chuckles]

11:21.889 --> 11:24.100
Well, "lose" for you 'cause, you know…

11:24.183 --> 11:25.518
bye-bye super strength,

11:25.601 --> 11:28.229
and, well, super sex, for that matter.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.231
Sacrifices must be made.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.943
Why would I lose my super strength?

11:36.028 --> 11:37.238
Lucifer! [gasps]

11:39.949 --> 11:40.991
Hey, Lucifer,

11:41.075 --> 11:43.744
uh, why would I lose my super strength?

11:43.828 --> 11:45.830
Well, once the blade
is no longer on Earth,

11:45.913 --> 11:47.957
Amenadiel's necklace
will become deactivated,

11:48.040 --> 11:50.835
which means
no more "Super Chloe." [chuckles]

11:50.918 --> 11:53.713
Maybe you don't need to take it back.
Maybe there's another way.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.381
[scoffs] What other way?

11:56.924 --> 12:00.469
I think it's time for Detective Decker
to make a comeback.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.098
We still have one mystery left to solve.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.435
The murder of Lucifer Morningstar.

12:08.936 --> 12:09.770
[exhales]

12:20.197 --> 12:21.282
Ahh.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.075
Lucifer, what are you doing?

12:23.159 --> 12:25.494
I told you we can fix this
without getting rid of the blade.

12:25.578 --> 12:29.540
And much as I appreciate your offer
to solve my pending patricide,

12:29.623 --> 12:30.916
there's a far simpler solution.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.169
No blade, no murder. [chuckles]

12:33.252 --> 12:35.087
What if it isn't the blade?

12:35.171 --> 12:38.591
Or what if one of your siblings just
brings it back down in a couple of weeks?

12:38.674 --> 12:41.469
-We would be completely unprepared.
-[sighs]

12:41.552 --> 12:44.805
Listen, we need to solve
the murder itself. That's the key.

12:44.889 --> 12:48.058
Chloe, you are an excellent detective,

12:48.142 --> 12:50.853
but how does one solve a murder
that hasn't happened yet?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.814
There's-- there's no crime scene.
There's no evidence.

12:53.898 --> 12:54.940
There's no body. [chuckles]

12:55.024 --> 12:56.984
Well, there is a body,
and it's magnificent,

12:57.067 --> 12:58.402
but it's very much alive.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.528
There's no witnesses.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.780
That's…

13:01.572 --> 13:03.240
That's not necessarily true.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.078
Oh.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.957
How many different kinds of olives
does a dude need?

13:12.041 --> 13:15.878
[Lucifer] Clearly I need to teach you
the finer art of martinis. [chuckles]

13:15.961 --> 13:19.882
[exhales] Um, Rory, do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

13:19.965 --> 13:21.217
I mean, if you're comfortable.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.595
[sighs] I don't know
what good it's gonna do, but whatever.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.517
[exhales] What do you actually know
about your father's disappearance?

13:30.434 --> 13:32.353
It ruined my life.

13:32.436 --> 13:35.022
Do I really need
to know anything else about it? [chuckles]

13:35.105 --> 13:39.276
Well, do you know what I was doing
or where Lucifer said he was going?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.362
Or who murdered me?

13:42.905 --> 13:44.907
-That's your theory?
-Hmm.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.868
Oh, well… [chuckles]
Sorry to burst your bullshit bubble,

13:47.952 --> 13:49.620
but nothing happened to you.

13:49.703 --> 13:50.663
You left.

13:51.956 --> 13:55.125
Right. Well, we're just trying
to make sense of all this.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.798
[sighs] All you told me was
you two were together in Van Nuys,

14:00.881 --> 14:02.716
near Tenth and Swanson.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.928
Lucifer turned the corner,
and you never saw him again.

14:06.428 --> 14:09.348
Hmm. Well, we have the scene of the crime.
That's a great start.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.892
But not particularly useful
since we don't know when it happens.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.143
August 4th.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.562
Clover's birthday.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.981
Who or what is a Clover?

14:17.064 --> 14:19.066
My favorite musician!

14:19.149 --> 14:20.401
Her songs slap.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.944
Will slap. Trust me.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.654
-[Lucifer] Oh.
-[Chloe] Hmm.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.156
-So, this August 4th?
-Mm-hmm.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.159
Well, that's three weeks from now.
That must mean…

14:29.827 --> 14:31.537
Do you think
I could be pregnant right now?

14:31.620 --> 14:32.746
Maybe it was last night.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.374
Or the night before on the balcony,
when you were up against the--

14:35.457 --> 14:37.793
Please don't do your sex math
in front of me.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.003
-Of course.
-Right.

14:39.086 --> 14:42.047
I don't know exactly when you guys…

14:43.424 --> 14:45.718
-[Lucifer exhales]
-Yeah.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.344
Um, can you remember anything else?

14:47.428 --> 14:49.889
Yeah, like why on earth
would I be in Van Nuys?

14:49.972 --> 14:53.851
I wouldn't be caught dead there.
Though… apparently I will be.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.855
This is how you two work together,
isn't it?

15:00.357 --> 15:03.652
The famous "Mom and Lucifer"
partnership. [chuckles]

15:03.736 --> 15:07.031
I gotta say,
you are really carrying him here, Mom.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.782
-[laughs]
-[clears throat]

15:09.783 --> 15:10.743
That's all I know.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.579
All right, well,
we have a future crime scene.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.080
-Let's get started.
-Mm.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.206
He didn't die!

15:16.290 --> 15:18.042
Yes, he did!

15:18.125 --> 15:19.043
-I did!
-[Rory chuckles]

15:19.126 --> 15:20.878
"Will." [hesitates] Whatever.

15:20.961 --> 15:23.964
Think about it!
If you did, Mom would have told me.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.383
Because that would have been a good reason
for you to leave.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.802
But she hid the truth,

15:28.886 --> 15:33.057
which means whatever happened
must have been pretty shitty.

15:34.350 --> 15:38.145
You stay here.
I don't want you getting into any trouble.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.480
You're grounding me?

15:39.563 --> 15:41.899
-If that's what you want to call it!
-Little late!

15:50.908 --> 15:53.661
I mean, don't you think our venue needs,

15:53.744 --> 15:57.331
like, spikes or a moat?

15:57.414 --> 15:59.458
[sighs] I mean, spikes and a moat?

15:59.541 --> 16:04.838
Our wedding is going
to be spikes and moat-free.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.758
I am saving that for the honeymoon.

16:07.841 --> 16:10.344
[both chuckle]

16:10.427 --> 16:11.971
Hey, Maze. Hey, Aunt Eve.

16:14.098 --> 16:17.685
An entire wall of liquor upstairs
and it's all just whiskey?

16:18.602 --> 16:19.812
Come on…

16:19.895 --> 16:21.730
Mama needs a rum. Oh.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.648
Who are you?

16:24.525 --> 16:25.818
Right. [chuckles]

16:25.901 --> 16:27.152
Sorry.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.779
Uh, long story short,

16:28.862 --> 16:31.824
I'm Lucifer and Chloe's daughter
from the future.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.201
Ooh, what's that?

16:35.202 --> 16:37.413
Oh, the wedding
hasn't happened yet, has it?

16:37.496 --> 16:38.497
What do you mean?

16:39.665 --> 16:42.376
-Something goes wrong with the wedding?
-Hold up.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.920
Why is she "Aunt Eve,"
and I'm just "Maze"?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.090
I've said too much. [exhales]

16:48.173 --> 16:51.135
Time Travel 101.
Ixnay on the oilerspays. [chuckles]

16:52.261 --> 16:53.095
[gulps]

16:53.178 --> 16:54.888
[gasps] Can I get you another drink?

16:55.931 --> 16:56.974
Yeah.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.312
I can think of worse places to die.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.356
-Well, one. Florida.
-Hmm.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.442
[scoffs] Does any of this look familiar?

17:06.525 --> 17:07.735
[exhales] I can absolutely,

17:07.818 --> 17:10.612
categorically say
I've never been here before in my life.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.990
[sighs] What about real estate owned?

17:13.073 --> 17:15.826
Business conducted? Favors done?

17:15.909 --> 17:18.162
Nada, Detective,
though I'm not sure it matters.

17:18.245 --> 17:20.539
Now that we've been here,
I know never to return. [chuckles]

17:20.622 --> 17:22.541
Lucifer,
you can't be sure that will save you.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.626
-A lot can happen in three weeks.
-Agreed.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.587
Like a vacation in Colombia?

17:26.670 --> 17:28.797
Beautiful beaches,
mountains of illicit drugs.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.340
Like a home away from home, really.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.593
Lucifer, stop running from the problem.

17:32.676 --> 17:35.596
We have to solve this case
to save your life.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.182
So, please, help me find a clue.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.517
-Or help me find anything.
-Detective…

17:40.601 --> 17:43.187
Chloe, how can I help you find what isn't…

17:44.271 --> 17:45.105
there.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.110
-[Chloe] Do you recognize her?
-I do.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.489
Though I can't quite say from where.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.157
[Chloe] Hmm.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.660
[Lucifer mutters]

18:05.667 --> 18:07.753
-Killed by a dentist.
-Hmm.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.340
Well, dental surgeon, maybe.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.927
I'd even take a podiatrist,
but this. It can't be.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.138
-Excuse me, could I speak with Dr. Kyle?
-[Lucifer sighs]

18:18.222 --> 18:20.140
What is this regarding?

18:20.224 --> 18:21.183
Invisalign?

18:21.266 --> 18:23.227
For-- what? No.

18:23.310 --> 18:26.355
Uh, do you recognize this man?
Has he ever been here before?

18:27.481 --> 18:28.816
No. I don't think so.

18:28.899 --> 18:32.152
Right. Can you think of any reason
that your boss might want to murder me?

18:32.236 --> 18:33.153
What? [chuckles]

18:33.237 --> 18:34.780
-Lucifer…
-[Lucifer exhales]

18:35.781 --> 18:39.118
-Is any of this ringing a bell?
-No, nothing at all.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.830
And I clearly didn't do this woman a favor
because she's, well, a dentist.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.166
I must have slept with her

18:46.250 --> 18:49.294
and awakened a powerful lust
that curdled into a murderous hate.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.589
But you remember everybody you sleep with.
Like, every detail.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.551
-But there was the masked orgy.
-What?

18:55.634 --> 18:57.636
I slept with her. That must be it.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.179
What?

19:01.014 --> 19:02.975
You slept with my wife?

19:03.684 --> 19:05.477
You're married to the dentist?

19:05.561 --> 19:07.312
But you're the receptionist.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.898
-Well, no wonder she slept with me.
-[woman] Excuse me.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.317
Is everything okay in here?

19:13.026 --> 19:14.528
I knew it.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.949
And to think I worked so hard
to keep my fling with Cindy a secret.

19:19.032 --> 19:19.992
What?

19:21.118 --> 19:22.369
[sobbing]

19:22.452 --> 19:25.497
Oh, this place is amazing.
I should be getting my teeth cleaned here.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.500
No wonder you never noticed
the crazy sexual tension

19:28.584 --> 19:29.751
between me and Cindy!

19:29.835 --> 19:33.255
Probably 'cause you were too busy
doing the old plaque-rinse with this guy.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.257
-Right?
-I don't even know who he is.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.258
Hmm.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.636
You said it was a masked orgy,
so how would you recognize her face?

19:41.013 --> 19:44.057
-Oh, good point.

That too, but I don't

22:04.114 --> 22:07.451
♪ The roses started blooming… ♪

22:07.534 --> 22:09.828
Seriously, forget I said anything.

22:10.746 --> 22:11.663
Okay.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.457
She called me Aunt Eve.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.542
That means we're still in her life. Right?

22:16.460 --> 22:17.669
Yeah, you are.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.087
Not me. I'm just Maze.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.255
Not "Aunt Maze."

22:20.339 --> 22:22.966
Just plain old "Maze,"
which means we're probably not together.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.011
-We don't know that for sure, babe.
-Then what else does it mean, Eve?

22:26.803 --> 22:28.930
Okay, Maze. [sighs]

22:29.014 --> 22:32.434
I told you texting me there's an emergency
when you really just want a drink--

22:32.517 --> 22:35.645
Hey, Amenadiel, this is Rory.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.982
Lucifer and Chloe's daughter.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.234
From the future.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.363
-From where?
-More like "when."

22:44.446 --> 22:48.533
[gasps] Yeah, and she knows
what happens to all of us.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.660
Apparently, Eve breaks up with me.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.996
We don't know who breaks up with who.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.415
Well, see?
Now you're admitting that we break up!

22:55.499 --> 22:58.794
No! We don't know anything for sure.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.089
You are right, baby.

23:02.964 --> 23:03.924
We don't.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.427
But you do.

23:08.011 --> 23:11.431
Guys, I-- I wish I could tell you.
I really do.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.850
But I can't. My hands are tied.

23:14.434 --> 23:17.604
And I especially can't tell you
in front of this random stranger.

23:17.687 --> 23:18.563
"Rand--"

23:19.314 --> 23:22.025
Wait a minute.
My future niece doesn't even know me?

23:22.109 --> 23:24.027
Shit, you're one of my uncles?

23:24.111 --> 23:27.656
Um, yeah, yeah, I'm your uncle Amenadiel.

23:28.615 --> 23:31.243
The greatest warrior of the Silver City?

23:32.494 --> 23:34.162
God's favorite son?

23:34.246 --> 23:38.375
Oh, of course! Amenadiel! [chuckles]

23:38.458 --> 23:40.293
-Lucifer's little bro.
-"Big."

23:40.377 --> 23:44.005
Big brother.
Yeah, I know who you are. [scoffs]

23:44.089 --> 23:45.715
Let me make you a drink.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.928
-Does this mean I die?
-[Eve] Guess so.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.722
You die. Our wedding's a disaster.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.434
-Maybe I die at your wedding.
-What?

23:55.517 --> 23:58.812
I just sent your invitation.
This is all my fault.

24:01.773 --> 24:02.607
[inhales]

24:06.319 --> 24:08.155
You're torturing us, aren't you?

24:11.992 --> 24:13.743
[chuckles]

24:13.827 --> 24:16.913
Game recognizes game, Auntie Maze.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.082
Learned from the best.

24:19.166 --> 24:22.711
[laughing]

24:22.794 --> 24:25.505
That's good! That's good!

24:25.589 --> 24:26.798
See?

24:26.882 --> 24:30.051
-You are an amazing aunt.
-Mm.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.219
Mwah!

24:31.928 --> 24:35.474
[sighs] Maybe an even
better mom one day, huh?

24:36.933 --> 24:37.893
[kisses]

24:37.976 --> 24:40.312
[laughs] Sorry, Uncle A.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.565
I couldn't help myself. [chuckles]

24:44.774 --> 24:46.359
Hey, I was kidding.

24:46.443 --> 24:50.447
You know who I am.
I mean, you will, at least. So…

24:50.530 --> 24:53.033
I believe you, it's just, um…

24:53.909 --> 24:55.619
How long have you been here?

24:55.702 --> 24:57.996
Um, a couple of days maybe.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.791
Oh, are you mad
I didn't come see you sooner?

25:01.875 --> 25:04.628
No, no. I didn't, uh…

25:05.462 --> 25:07.339
I didn't feel your presence.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.592
And if I didn't know
about an angel from the future

25:10.675 --> 25:12.385
being here on Earth, then…

25:14.012 --> 25:16.264
then maybe there's other things
happening in the world

25:16.348 --> 25:17.682
that I'm unaware of.

25:21.561 --> 25:22.395
[sighs]

25:23.522 --> 25:25.941
[laughs] Of course.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.735
[sniffs] Mmm.

25:28.818 --> 25:31.988
1926 Macallan. Hmm, this has got to do it.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.576
[Chloe chuckles]

25:39.454 --> 25:40.497
Oh, come on!

25:40.580 --> 25:44.960
That is a $40,000 pour of whiskey
you've just refused. [scoffs]

25:45.043 --> 25:48.004
[sighs] Look, I've offered you money,
your own dental practice…

25:48.088 --> 25:49.881
I'll even throw in a new dog, hmm?

25:49.965 --> 25:52.884
Two dogs? All the dogs!

25:53.510 --> 25:56.471
[sighs] Why don't you understand?
It's very simple.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.349
I'm trying to bribe you
into not wanting to murder me.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.977
So, what's it going to take?

26:02.060 --> 26:02.894
I just

26:03.645 --> 26:04.938
want Erin back.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.024
She was my world.

26:08.108 --> 26:12.946
-But you cheated on her.
-I know! [sobbing]

26:13.029 --> 26:14.072
[scoffs]

26:14.155 --> 26:16.908
Okay. So if we could get
your wife to take you back,

26:16.992 --> 26:20.203
do you think that maybe you
wouldn't wanna kill Lucifer anymore?

26:22.581 --> 26:25.417
Do you really think you could get
my Honey Badger to take me back?

26:25.500 --> 26:28.587
Well, between the two of us,
we've accomplished the impossible.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.172
How hard could it be
to reignite a love connection?

26:31.256 --> 26:32.090
I just, uh…

26:32.841 --> 26:34.843
-[sighs] No, excuse us.
-[Chloe chuckles]

26:35.552 --> 26:37.429
-[Lucifer] Over here.
-[Chloe] Hmm.

26:37.512 --> 26:38.346
Hey!

26:39.014 --> 26:39.931
[Lucifer] Mm.

26:40.974 --> 26:42.267
Oh, that is good.

26:42.350 --> 26:45.061
So, say we do that,

26:45.145 --> 26:47.397
then there's no guarantee it'll stick.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.691
He-- he could end up
stepping out on his wife again,

26:49.774 --> 26:51.151
find a way to blame me for it

26:51.234 --> 26:53.945
and then snap right back
into a murderous rage

26:54.029 --> 26:55.155
when our guard is down.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.198
We're playing
right into fate's hands here.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.783
Well, what else can we do?

27:00.702 --> 27:02.412
I know just how to avoid it.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.332
[Chloe] Lucifer, what--

27:06.666 --> 27:07.876
Two seconds.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.961
-What are you doing?
-[Lucifer] Cutting to the chase.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.714
I'm gonna put Azrael's blade in his hand
and see if he kills me.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.174
Then we'll have our answer.

27:14.257 --> 27:17.260
Seriously? Are you really willing to die

27:17.344 --> 27:19.721
to prove that
you didn't abandon your daughter?

27:21.389 --> 27:22.390
Apparently so.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.644
-[scoffs]
-[beeps]

27:36.446 --> 27:37.280
It's gone.

27:37.864 --> 27:38.865
What?

27:39.783 --> 27:41.451
It doesn't make sense, 'cause…

27:42.535 --> 27:45.747
the only people who've been here
recently are the two of us… [inhales]

27:46.539 --> 27:49.834
-…Tears for Fears out there…
-[both gasp]

27:50.585 --> 27:51.670
…and Rory.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.715
Lucifer, don't say it.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.551
My own daughter kills me.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.517
Just when I thought I'd heard it all.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.062
-Future child angst…
-[Lucifer] Hmm.

28:09.145 --> 28:11.856
…being faced by present-day parents.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.276
I've never dealt with that before.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.904
[laughs] No one's dealt with that before.

28:19.155 --> 28:22.117
-This'll be perfect for Chapter 17.
-Chapter 17?

28:22.200 --> 28:23.493
Oh, not important.

28:23.576 --> 28:26.371
-Okay, so, where shall we start?
-Who are you again?

28:26.955 --> 28:29.082
The only Linda Martin I know
is a convicted felon.

28:29.165 --> 28:32.502
Don't listen to her, Doctor.
She just pulled this trick with Amenadiel.

28:32.585 --> 28:36.589
Apparently, my daughter lies.
Apple fell miles from the tree, it seems.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.758
Hmm. Maybe I'd know better
if you'd ever been around.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.302
-Oh.
-But I was.

28:41.928 --> 28:43.304
Is that how I raised you?

28:43.930 --> 28:46.474
-You had a lot to deal with, Mom.
-What does that mean, honey?

28:46.558 --> 28:49.394
More subterfuge, I'm sure.
She's just trying to stir things up.

28:49.477 --> 28:52.647
God. You still here? Don't let the door
hit ya where I should've split ya.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.774
Oh, that's funny.
Where'd you learn that? The future?

28:54.858 --> 28:58.862
Okay, okay, okay.
I can sense that you're both very angry.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.363
But I can also see…

29:01.406 --> 29:04.451
that you're both
not as different as you may think.

29:04.534 --> 29:07.454
-[Lucifer and Rory chuckle]
-[Chloe exhales]

29:08.288 --> 29:10.123
-[Rory chuckles]
-[Lucifer sighs]

29:10.206 --> 29:13.626
Okay, Rory,
we often use anger to protect ourselves.

29:14.419 --> 29:19.048
But underneath, you might be feeling
a more-- a more vulnerable emotion.

29:20.383 --> 29:21.676
And you…

29:22.260 --> 29:25.096
Perhaps you could try
being more empathetic,

29:25.180 --> 29:30.185
considering Rory's been through
the very thing you have.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.061
Your father was absent too.

29:32.145 --> 29:34.981
Hmm. My father made that choice. I didn't.

29:35.064 --> 29:36.733
-You don't know that.
-Yes, I do.

29:36.816 --> 29:38.610
Because "A," I would never choose that.

29:38.693 --> 29:41.613
-And "B," I know you killed me.
-[Chloe] Lucifer…

29:42.489 --> 29:45.283
Mom, what's he talking about?

29:45.366 --> 29:47.035
You know Azrael's blade?

29:47.118 --> 29:49.871
It-- it went missing from the safe.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.581
And you think I took it?

29:51.664 --> 29:54.751
Somebody did, and the only people
who had access were the three of us, so…

29:54.834 --> 29:57.462
Lucifer, we don't know that!
It could've been someone else.

29:57.545 --> 30:01.341
It wasn't anyone else.
It had to have been her. [exhales]

30:01.424 --> 30:04.552
Lucifer, why are you so threatened
by your daughter?

30:04.636 --> 30:06.346
Oh, come on. This isn't a jump.

30:06.429 --> 30:09.182
It isn't even a hop.
She's already tried to kill me once.

30:09.265 --> 30:11.017
-Yeah, but I didn't.
-[Lucifer exhales]

30:11.100 --> 30:13.186
Pull your head out of your butt and think.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.522
If I wanted to kill you,
why would I be doing this?

30:15.605 --> 30:17.732
It's all part of your ruse
to steal the blade

30:17.816 --> 30:19.859
and remove me from existence entirely.

30:20.443 --> 30:22.821
-[scoffs] I'm sorry.
-[Rory sighs]

30:22.904 --> 30:25.240
You have nothing to be sorry for.

30:25.323 --> 30:28.827
-He's the one who should apologize.
-No, Rory, this is my fault.

30:29.869 --> 30:32.580
-Why do you feel that way, Chloe?
-[inhales, hesitates]

30:32.664 --> 30:35.124
It's because you had me
keep the blade on Earth, isn't it?

30:35.208 --> 30:38.378
Which is good, because now
we are getting to the bottom of things.

30:38.461 --> 30:42.006
-Lucifer, you don't understand.
-Oh, I understand completely.

30:42.090 --> 30:45.009
She's the only one
with motive, means and opportunity.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.178
That's why you brought me here?

30:48.012 --> 30:50.682
This isn't family therapy.
It's an interrogation?

30:50.765 --> 30:54.936
[gasps] I can't believe you did this.
I am not a murder suspect.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.145
I'm your daughter.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.148
[sobs]

31:01.693 --> 31:02.902
[door closes]

31:03.945 --> 31:04.821
[Lucifer grunts]

31:06.781 --> 31:08.908
She takes after you in her exits.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.411
[Lucifer exhales]

31:15.206 --> 31:16.165
[huffs]

31:18.209 --> 31:21.462
[exhales] That could have gone better.

31:22.922 --> 31:26.426
I mean, I could have done better.

31:26.509 --> 31:27.385
[Chloe grunts]

31:27.468 --> 31:28.303
[Lucifer gasps]

31:29.762 --> 31:30.805
Truth is, I…

31:32.181 --> 31:33.850
I don't know how to do this.

31:34.642 --> 31:37.520
[sighs] Lucifer,

31:38.313 --> 31:39.564
this was all my fault.

31:39.647 --> 31:42.191
No, no, no, no. You can't blame yourself.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.944
-Yes, I can.
-[exhales]

31:45.862 --> 31:47.071
'Cause I lied.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.127
[sighs]

32:02.503 --> 32:05.006
[scoffs] How did you know that was there?

32:05.882 --> 32:07.717
Because I'm the one who took it.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.846
I hid the blade to keep it safe.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.431
To keep you safe.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.519
Well, and now that you know Rory
wasn't the one who stole the blade,

32:18.603 --> 32:21.064
you know, I'm sure
we can just talk to her and fix this.

32:21.814 --> 32:22.649
[exhales]

32:22.732 --> 32:25.735
I think there's something else
we need to fix first, Chloe.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.655
The blade needs to go back to Heaven.

32:28.738 --> 32:29.614
What?

32:29.697 --> 32:32.033
No, I told you, I was protecting you.
That's it.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.117
Is this about me?

32:34.035 --> 32:35.119
Or you?

32:35.912 --> 32:36.746
Oh, Chloe.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.458
Chloe, I am so sorry.

32:40.541 --> 32:43.086
I-- I should have seen this before.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.338
Why are you sorry?

32:46.255 --> 32:49.801
This makes me feel strong.

32:49.884 --> 32:51.594
I don't want to give that up.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.680
And clearly you are too attached

32:53.763 --> 32:56.557
to the strength the necklace
gives you when the blade is here.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.059
No, I am fine.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.394
I can control it.

32:59.477 --> 33:00.812
Can you?

33:00.895 --> 33:02.438
Because I'm starting to think

33:02.522 --> 33:05.942
the only reason you've been
pushing so hard on this case, Detective,

33:06.025 --> 33:07.860
is that you didn't want to let it go.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.612
-Well, you're wrong.
-Chloe…

33:11.406 --> 33:14.117
You let me believe that my own daughter,

33:14.200 --> 33:16.077
our daughter,

33:16.911 --> 33:18.079
wanted to kill me.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.334
Well, I think
you're being a little dramatic.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.712
And everything turned out fine.

33:25.795 --> 33:28.589
You're not in control.
Now give me the blade.

33:29.632 --> 33:32.051
[gasps] No!

33:32.135 --> 33:35.805
[grunting, panting]

33:39.100 --> 33:40.977
[grunting]

33:41.602 --> 33:43.438
[panting]

33:43.521 --> 33:44.564
[grunts]

33:46.983 --> 33:49.068
I know what I'm doing,

33:49.152 --> 33:51.946
and you're not taking it away.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.032
[shuddering]

33:59.120 --> 34:03.124
-Lucifer, don't make me hurt you.
-Huh?

34:03.666 --> 34:06.461
[grunting]

34:08.880 --> 34:11.632
Give it to me!

34:11.716 --> 34:13.217
-Let…
-[grunts]

34:13.301 --> 34:15.053
…go! [panting]

34:17.680 --> 34:20.349
[Chloe shouts]

34:21.517 --> 34:22.810
[Lucifer grunts]

34:23.519 --> 34:24.854
[both grunt]

34:25.563 --> 34:27.106
[Chloe] Oh!

34:32.153 --> 34:34.155
[panting]

34:35.281 --> 34:37.992
[echoing] Okay, Chloe… Chloe?

34:38.910 --> 34:40.453
[yells]

34:40.536 --> 34:43.331
[grunting]

34:44.499 --> 34:48.002
-[Chloe shouts]
-[grunting]

34:48.586 --> 34:52.590
-[Chloe] Oh!
-[whimpers]

34:52.673 --> 34:56.219
Well, I certainly did not see this coming.

34:57.553 --> 34:59.680
But I guess
that means we've solved our case.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.933
[panting]

35:02.725 --> 35:04.685
This must be how I die.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.729
[exhales] What? No.

35:07.563 --> 35:08.981
No, of course not.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.026
It was just instinct. I…

35:12.860 --> 35:14.278
I would never hurt you.

35:14.987 --> 35:17.031
-[gasping]
-I would never hurt you.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.074
[sniffles]

35:19.909 --> 35:22.745
[gasps] What's happening to me?

35:23.663 --> 35:24.997
It's not your fault.

35:25.873 --> 35:26.874
It's that blade.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.544
It drives every human to Stabby Town.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.754
No… [gasping]

35:31.838 --> 35:34.298
I lost control before I took the blade.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.467
There's no one to blame but me.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.386
[gasping]

35:38.469 --> 35:41.389
Lucifer, I want you to… [shudders]

35:41.472 --> 35:44.100
[sobbing] I need you to take it from me.

35:44.892 --> 35:45.726
All right.

35:46.435 --> 35:47.270
All right.

35:47.353 --> 35:51.858
-[Chloe sniffles]
-All right. [shuddering]

35:52.441 --> 35:55.778
-Oh. Oh, it's all right. It's all right.
-[sobbing]

36:07.290 --> 36:08.749
[door opens]

36:10.585 --> 36:12.211
-[Amenadiel] Hi.
-Oh, Amenadiel! [gasps]

36:12.295 --> 36:15.590
You, uh, snuck up on me there. What's up?

36:16.632 --> 36:19.635
I wanted to talk to you. To apologize.

36:19.719 --> 36:20.636
For what?

36:21.179 --> 36:23.598
I was a little dismissive of you earlier.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.727
And I'm beginning to realize that maybe
there are things that I haven't noticed

36:27.810 --> 36:29.770
that are happening in the world.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.566
And that could even include,
say, the end of it, so--

36:33.649 --> 36:36.194
I don't mean to Kanye you.
I'm totally gonna let you finish,

36:36.277 --> 36:40.323
but I was just,
you know, cuckoo. [chuckles]

36:40.406 --> 36:42.450
Yeah, no, I-- I found the sock.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.619
It was just stuck in the lint trap.

36:45.203 --> 36:49.624
So, thank you, universe,
which is clearly not ending. [laughs]

36:50.208 --> 36:52.168
-[Amenadiel] Hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.252
And the river?

36:53.336 --> 36:54.295
Uh, Kool-Aid.

36:54.378 --> 36:58.466
Yeah, a tractor trailer crashed
and dumped a bunch of it into the river,

36:58.549 --> 37:00.676
so it's seriously not a big deal.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.678
I mean, a big deal ecologically,

37:02.762 --> 37:04.555
but totally not a big deal

37:04.639 --> 37:07.058
in the earth-shattering way
I thought it was.

37:07.141 --> 37:08.893
-Well, I'm glad.
-Yeah, me too.

37:08.976 --> 37:12.688
I mean, sayonara
apocalypse conspiracy theories

37:12.772 --> 37:17.652
and back to regular
old forensic science work. [chuckles]

37:24.158 --> 37:26.160
[frog croaking]

38:23.426 --> 38:24.677
[knock on door]

38:27.305 --> 38:28.139
[Chloe] Hi.

38:28.222 --> 38:31.434
Um, is the blade gone?
It doesn't feel gone.

38:31.517 --> 38:32.435
Not yet.

38:32.518 --> 38:35.146
I thought there was something
we should try before…

38:35.229 --> 38:37.440
well, before the opportunity escapes us.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.613
-Dan.
-[Dan gasps]

38:45.448 --> 38:46.657
Hey, Chloe.

38:46.741 --> 38:47.658
Hi.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.704
-[Dan] Hi.
-[hesitates]

38:51.787 --> 38:53.497
I can't believe this. I--

38:54.540 --> 38:58.044
-You look great. I mean…
-You're a sight for sore eyes too.

39:02.131 --> 39:05.760
Um, I thought you said
that I wouldn't be able to see him.

39:05.843 --> 39:08.929
Well, it occurred to me
that Amenadiel's necklace might imbue you

39:09.013 --> 39:11.849
with more celestial qualities
than just super strength.

39:14.101 --> 39:16.270
-Oh, Dan…
-I'm-- I'm just a soul.

39:17.938 --> 39:19.398
So I'm not solid.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.526
But you can see, and you can hear me.

39:24.195 --> 39:27.031
Oh. Right.

39:28.657 --> 39:30.284
[shudders]

39:30.368 --> 39:31.952
So when you take the blade

39:33.245 --> 39:35.998
back up to Heaven,
I won't be able to see him anymore?

39:36.582 --> 39:37.833
You won't.

39:38.417 --> 39:41.712
-[exhales]
-We weren't even sure if I should come.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.590
We didn't wanna make
this any harder for you.

39:44.673 --> 39:47.802
But then we thought it wouldn't be
fair to make that decision for you.

39:50.805 --> 39:51.847
[gasps]

39:53.015 --> 39:56.602
Um, can you give us a few hours?

39:56.685 --> 39:57.686
Of course.

40:10.533 --> 40:13.411
["Sleep on Me" by Creams playing]

40:13.494 --> 40:16.539
[chattering]

40:19.333 --> 40:20.167
Anyway,

40:20.876 --> 40:23.796
the blade will be
back in Heaven where it belongs,

40:24.755 --> 40:27.675
which means I won't die.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.719
[chuckles] And-- and that's a bad thing,

40:30.803 --> 40:33.180
so you called me here
to complain about being alive?

40:33.264 --> 40:34.181
No.

40:34.849 --> 40:38.060
No, I called you because,
for some unknown reason,

40:38.144 --> 40:42.022
I end up doing to my daughter
the very thing my father did to me.

40:42.606 --> 40:43.732
[exhales]

40:43.816 --> 40:46.569
The thing that your mom did to you.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.197
Which makes me
just as bad as them. [scoffs]

40:51.073 --> 40:52.199
Worse, maybe.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.036
And you want me to torture you
so you feel better about yourself?

40:57.663 --> 40:59.957
No. No, Maze. [chuckles]

41:00.708 --> 41:02.126
[sighs]

41:02.209 --> 41:03.377
No. [huffs]

41:04.211 --> 41:05.045
I want…

41:05.880 --> 41:07.381
I want your…

41:07.465 --> 41:08.299
You know…

41:08.883 --> 41:10.217
You want my advice?

41:11.302 --> 41:12.386
Yes.

41:13.345 --> 41:16.140
[inhales, clears throat]

41:17.349 --> 41:21.187
Well, some people
aren't meant to be parents.

41:21.770 --> 41:24.732
Agreed, but here I am.

41:24.815 --> 41:25.858
So…

41:27.776 --> 41:30.446
I think you're asking
all the wrong questions.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.990
It doesn't matter why you do it.

41:33.657 --> 41:35.659
You won't know until it happens.

41:36.368 --> 41:38.746
But you need to think about your daughter.

41:39.955 --> 41:44.126
What she's gone through.
How hurt and alone…

41:45.711 --> 41:46.921
she must have felt.

41:48.964 --> 41:50.841
How hurt and alone she feels now.

41:53.552 --> 41:57.515
The real question
you have to ask yourself, Lucifer…

41:58.933 --> 42:01.268
is, "What am I going to do to fix this?"

42:02.394 --> 42:05.231
[Chloe and Dan laughing]

42:05.314 --> 42:06.315
She was so tired.

42:06.398 --> 42:10.027
I know, but Trixie refused
to let the chocolate cake go.

42:10.110 --> 42:14.490
-Oh, my God. I almost lost it!
-[chuckles] I know. Me too. [sighs]

42:14.573 --> 42:15.699
Oh, man.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.034
[Chloe laughs]

42:17.117 --> 42:18.285
How's she doing?

42:19.620 --> 42:20.538
You know.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.998
She's, um--

42:23.082 --> 42:24.208
It's been hard.

42:25.167 --> 42:28.504
But, uh, she's strong. Just like her dad.

42:28.587 --> 42:30.589
[both chuckle]

42:31.799 --> 42:33.509
And how are you doing?

42:34.552 --> 42:37.221
Uh, well,

42:37.304 --> 42:40.558
turns out with super strength
I can protect myself.

42:40.641 --> 42:43.769
I can protect the ones I love.

42:44.436 --> 42:45.688
But there's no

42:47.106 --> 42:49.024
celestial object to

42:50.150 --> 42:53.195
take away how all of this feels,
you know? It's been hard.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.990
A lot harder than I thought it would be.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.579
I'm sorry, Chloe.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.665
Dan, you were

43:06.250 --> 43:08.752
-an amazing man.
-[sobs]

43:09.461 --> 43:13.299
-A great cop, an incredible father.
-[sobs]

43:15.259 --> 43:18.178
Listen, can I
tell you something? [sniffles]

43:19.096 --> 43:23.434
At first, I blamed myself
for what happened to you.

43:23.517 --> 43:24.351
But then…

43:26.186 --> 43:28.147
Then I realized that… [sniffles]

43:30.107 --> 43:32.818
God, at least I got
to be there when you died.

43:34.862 --> 43:35.821
[sobbing] But, Dan…

43:38.365 --> 43:41.035
ever since you've been gone, I just…

43:42.453 --> 43:44.496
I've felt so powerless.

43:45.706 --> 43:47.833
[gasps, sniffles]

43:47.916 --> 43:50.169
Listen, there's something
that you need to know, okay?

43:51.170 --> 43:52.588
-[exhales]
-You're right.

43:53.422 --> 43:55.007
Trixie is strong.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.801
But it's not because of me.

43:58.844 --> 44:00.054
It's because of you.

44:00.971 --> 44:03.807
And you don't need some silly necklace
to give you strength, Chloe,

44:03.891 --> 44:06.226
because you're the strongest woman
I've ever met in my life.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.978
[sniffles] Oh, Dan…

44:09.188 --> 44:11.649
[sniffles] Oh, God…

44:12.524 --> 44:13.359
Dan…

44:17.196 --> 44:20.699
[shuddering]

44:20.783 --> 44:21.742
Dan?

44:28.874 --> 44:30.793
[sniffles] Dan…

44:33.087 --> 44:35.923
[sniffles] If you can see me…

44:36.924 --> 44:39.051
[sobbing] …if you can hear me…

44:40.386 --> 44:41.553
Thank you.

44:43.681 --> 44:46.016
[sniffles] Thank you.

44:47.601 --> 44:50.813
[shuddering]
I can't tell you how much I needed this.

44:51.814 --> 44:53.524
[shudders, gasps]

44:54.817 --> 44:55.901
[exhales]

44:57.277 --> 44:59.613
[continues sniffling and sobbing]
