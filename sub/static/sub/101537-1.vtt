01:03.048 --> 01:04.882
Are we there?

01:04.917 --> 01:06.685
Shh.

01:11.223 --> 01:13.125
It's gonna be okay,

01:13.158 --> 01:15.560
but we got to go.

01:15.594 --> 01:17.930
- 'Kay?
- Okay.

01:17.963 --> 01:20.699
Alright. Come on.

01:40.686 --> 01:43.488
- Look! I can see it over there.
- Yeah.

02:45.183 --> 02:46.885
Do you see
the bad things?

02:48.820 --> 02:50.722
No.

02:50.756 --> 02:55.594
No, I think we can
rest here for a minute.

02:55.627 --> 02:58.663
What do they
look like up close?

02:59.365 --> 03:01.566
The bad things?

03:01.600 --> 03:03.735
They're just, uh...

03:03.769 --> 03:05.871
evil.

03:15.047 --> 03:16.548
Shh-shh-shh.

03:19.718 --> 03:22.187
Can you tell me a story?

03:22.220 --> 03:24.723
No, we have to be real quiet.

03:24.756 --> 03:26.892
But when I'm scared,
Mommy tells me a story.

03:26.925 --> 03:30.228
Well, your mommy knows
all the stories.

03:30.263 --> 03:33.065
I don't know
any good stories.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.701
Can I tell you a story?

03:38.804 --> 03:42.207
- But I'm scared. I'm really scared.
- Okay, okay, okay.

03:42.240 --> 03:45.877
But you have
to whisper. Okay?

03:45.911 --> 03:48.013
- Like this?
- Yeah.

03:48.046 --> 03:49.648
Just...

03:50.115 --> 03:53.218
like... that.

03:56.221 --> 03:57.889
Okay.

03:57.923 --> 04:00.792
Once upon a time,
there was a...

04:45.804 --> 04:48.407
What do you want?

04:48.441 --> 04:51.076
Look, man, I just need to talk
to you, you know, for a second.

04:51.109 --> 04:53.178
I already told you, you call my
lawyer you got something to say.

04:53.211 --> 04:56.148
Just hear me out for a minute,
and I'll leave you alone.

04:56.181 --> 04:57.215
I promise.

04:58.384 --> 05:00.085
Please?

05:01.786 --> 05:03.389
You got five minutes.

05:08.059 --> 05:11.062
Take a look at this.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.769
Why are you
showing me this?

05:17.802 --> 05:20.906
Be... Well, 'cause this is
what you're holding up.

05:20.939 --> 05:24.042
A new medical complex that
this area desperately needs.

05:24.075 --> 05:26.178
Since when do you
care about the neighborhood?

05:26.211 --> 05:28.414
You know, I heard a rumor

05:28.447 --> 05:30.483
that this whole
medical building thing

05:30.516 --> 05:32.451
is just a hoax
to get people to move.

05:32.485 --> 05:35.954
That you're really planning on building
more condos with much higher rent.

05:35.987 --> 05:39.458
Everybody else took my generous
offer and... and moved.

05:39.492 --> 05:41.092
Your family's
the last ones here.

05:42.528 --> 05:44.463
Okay, I shouldn't
do this, but, um...

05:44.497 --> 05:47.799
I'll up it ten grand if you
get out by the end of the week.

05:47.832 --> 05:50.035
I can't do that.

05:50.068 --> 05:52.103
My son is halfway through
chemotherapy,

05:52.137 --> 05:57.443
and the doctor says it's important
that he has no extra stress.

05:57.476 --> 05:59.211
Moving is stressful.

05:59.244 --> 06:03.848
I'm not gonna risk my son's
health for anything or anybody.

06:03.882 --> 06:05.750
So, you keep your money.

06:05.784 --> 06:08.887
- We will leave when Ethan is well...
- Stop bouncing that damn ball!

06:13.158 --> 06:16.962
Ethan, you keep bouncing that ball, son.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.168
You get the fuck
outta my place now.

06:23.201 --> 06:24.836
It's not your place.

06:24.869 --> 06:25.971
It is right now.

06:26.004 --> 06:27.340
So, get out!

06:29.975 --> 06:32.877
I am not gonna tell you again.

06:50.363 --> 06:51.997
Hey.

06:53.466 --> 06:56.167
That's my boy.
That's my boy.

07:05.344 --> 07:08.013
Hey, Joe. Uh, what's up?

07:08.046 --> 07:10.416
I'll tell you what's up.

07:10.449 --> 07:14.185
I need to clear escrow on this damn building
in two weeks or my financing falls through.

07:14.219 --> 07:16.821
<i>You told me there'd be
no problems,</i>

07:16.855 --> 07:20.526
<i>and now I hear there's a family
that you haven't been able to evict.</i>

07:20.559 --> 07:22.160
Uh, just a, you know, tiny snag.

07:22.193 --> 07:25.464
<i>You know, some, uh,
some judge's mom was, you know,</i>

07:25.498 --> 07:28.033
probably frightened
by... by a landlord.

07:30.068 --> 07:31.270
Oh.

07:32.170 --> 07:34.005
<i>Um...</i>

07:34.039 --> 07:36.409
listen, man,
they got a sick kid. Okay?

07:36.442 --> 07:39.911
They claim they can't move until their
little brat finishes chemotherapy.

07:39.944 --> 07:43.948
When you sold me this building,
you said it was all free and clear.

07:43.982 --> 07:45.451
If you screw me up...

07:45.484 --> 07:47.185
<i>...I'll have my lawyer sue you for fraud</i>

07:47.218 --> 07:50.423
and send you
to the fucking poorhouse.

07:51.490 --> 07:53.326
Yeah. Uh, yeah, man.

07:53.359 --> 07:54.360
I... I got it.

07:54.393 --> 07:56.094
No... no... no biggie.

08:18.317 --> 08:19.518
Hey!

08:19.552 --> 08:22.355
Jesus, Mickey.

08:22.388 --> 08:24.889
Got you that time, huh?

08:24.923 --> 08:27.092
Come on inside, man.
Come on.

08:29.562 --> 08:33.299
Haven't seen you in a while,
man. You need another job?

08:35.033 --> 08:37.602
- Have you been taking your medication?
- Which one?

08:39.672 --> 08:42.475
That stuff
fucks with my head, dude.

08:42.508 --> 08:45.009
I like to be clear.

08:47.979 --> 08:51.517
Anyway, um, I need
to ask your advice.

08:51.550 --> 08:53.252
Fire away.

08:53.285 --> 08:55.488
I got some people I need to get
out of one of my buildings.

08:55.521 --> 08:56.988
I mean, like, yesterday.

08:57.021 --> 09:01.159
Hey, David.
How the Bears been doin'?

09:01.192 --> 09:05.163
Hey, man! Stop trippin' out and
concentrate on what I'm saying!

09:10.436 --> 09:13.506
How do you start a fire that, you know,
that won't kill anybody or... or anything,

09:13.539 --> 09:16.941
- but do enough damage to make 'em go?
- I can do that if you want!

09:16.975 --> 09:21.146
Like that building I torched on Eighty-third
so you could collect the insurance.

09:22.180 --> 09:24.182
Yeah, that... that went smoothly.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.518
Maybe we can
work something out.

09:27.218 --> 09:29.288
Which building
and which apartment?

09:29.321 --> 09:30.589
Ruby Gates.

09:30.623 --> 09:33.426
Third floor, east corner,
apartment 313.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.495
That dump?

09:36.529 --> 09:40.064
That's easy.

09:40.098 --> 09:41.933
That place is already
a fire trap.

09:44.270 --> 09:45.738
All you gotta do

09:45.771 --> 09:50.208
is start a big grease fire
in the kitchen.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.976
When they hear the fire alarm,

09:52.010 --> 09:56.214
they got lots of time
to get out the rear exit

09:56.247 --> 09:59.117
before the fire can
even get close to 'em.

09:59.150 --> 10:01.420
Hey, man, how you, um,

10:01.454 --> 10:03.622
how you know all that stuff?

10:03.656 --> 10:06.991
You weren't thinking about
torching one of my buildings?

10:08.260 --> 10:11.129
I think about
a lot of things.

10:13.198 --> 10:14.633
Same price as
the Eighty-third Street job?

10:14.667 --> 10:16.268
Double.

10:16.302 --> 10:18.637
I didn't have to sneak past
anybody on that one.

10:18.671 --> 10:20.339
Okay.

10:20.372 --> 10:24.443
I'll show up with the money
after I hear the job is done.

10:27.379 --> 10:28.581
Okay.

10:30.282 --> 10:32.116
LeBron dribbles across the key,

10:32.150 --> 10:33.519
he cuts between defenders,

10:33.552 --> 10:35.119
goes to the hole...

10:35.153 --> 10:37.623
- Slam dunk!
- And the crowd goes wild!

10:37.656 --> 10:43.027
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

10:45.129 --> 10:48.400
Time to
hit the hay, Mr. MVP.

10:48.434 --> 10:50.402
You need your rest.

10:52.571 --> 10:54.640
Joey told me that

10:54.673 --> 10:56.509
people with tumors die.

10:56.542 --> 10:59.077
Will I die?

11:00.144 --> 11:01.547
Of course not.

11:03.248 --> 11:05.049
We have the best doctors around.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.785
We're gonna cure you.

11:06.819 --> 11:09.722
You are gonna live
to be an old man

11:09.755 --> 11:12.123
just like your daddy.

11:12.156 --> 11:13.259
That's pretty old.

11:13.292 --> 11:15.394
Tell me about it.

12:24.463 --> 12:26.197
Hello?

12:30.703 --> 12:31.804
Hello?

12:35.441 --> 12:37.208
Hello?

12:44.917 --> 12:47.252
Who the fuck is this?

12:51.690 --> 12:53.759
Um... s... sorry, detective.

12:53.792 --> 12:55.561
Um...

12:55.594 --> 12:57.363
Is... is something wrong?

13:06.605 --> 13:09.274
Ma'am, could you
please stay right behind that line?

13:15.347 --> 13:17.916
- Hey, um, officer...
- Sorry, no. It's restricted.

13:17.950 --> 13:20.218
I'm David Burr.
I'm the owner of the building.

13:20.252 --> 13:22.388
You got it. Go in.

13:27.993 --> 13:31.630
Mr. Burr. Detective Powers.

13:32.965 --> 13:34.933
Um, what happened?

13:34.967 --> 13:37.302
Fire up in apartment 313.

13:37.336 --> 13:40.406
- Was anybody hurt?
- No! No!

13:40.439 --> 13:45.243
My husband and my son!

13:45.277 --> 13:47.546
Where are they?

13:47.579 --> 13:49.213
No, no!

13:54.953 --> 13:56.755
Paul!

13:56.789 --> 13:58.791
Ethan! No!

13:58.824 --> 14:01.293
No, no, no!

14:01.326 --> 14:07.332
Oh, God!
Please, no, no!

14:09.568 --> 14:10.903
Um...

14:10.936 --> 14:13.439
h... how'd this happen?

14:13.472 --> 14:15.641
Looks like a grease fire.
We're not sure how it started.

14:15.674 --> 14:17.810
Why didn't they try to,
you know, to take the fire exit?

14:17.843 --> 14:19.011
Looks like they tried.

14:19.044 --> 14:21.480
As far as we can tell,
smoke alarm failed.

14:22.715 --> 14:24.983
By the time they realized
the place was on fire,

14:25.017 --> 14:27.286
smoke was probably
overwhelming.

14:27.319 --> 14:29.021
And then when they tried
to break the window,

14:29.054 --> 14:32.291
sudden rush of oxygen
created a fireball.

14:33.559 --> 14:35.527
Um, well, the mother's
still alive.

14:35.561 --> 14:37.329
They think
she's gonna make it?

14:38.063 --> 14:39.665
Don't know.

14:39.698 --> 14:41.734
She burnt real bad.

14:43.969 --> 14:45.738
Excuse me.

15:13.665 --> 15:15.434
Yes?

15:37.756 --> 15:39.825
<i>You've
reached the Bradford residence.</i>

15:39.858 --> 15:41.927
<i>We're not available right now</i>

15:41.960 --> 15:43.862
<i>because you burned us alive.</i>

16:33.879 --> 16:37.382
David. Didn't expect you
till later. Come on.

16:37.416 --> 16:39.985
Figured you...
you'd want your money.

16:40.018 --> 16:42.387
Oh, no rush. I trust ya.

16:43.622 --> 16:46.658
Hey, let's celebrate, man.

16:46.692 --> 16:48.961
That family's out
of Ruby Gates, right?

16:48.994 --> 16:50.562
They sure are.

16:50.596 --> 16:54.566
I got a malt liquor in here
with your name on it.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.901
You don't watch the news,
do you?

16:55.934 --> 16:58.070
Hell, no.

16:58.103 --> 17:01.907
Don't you know? When you watch
people on TV, they watch you back.

17:01.940 --> 17:04.142
It's creepy.

17:13.752 --> 17:14.786
Why?

17:14.819 --> 17:16.154
People are dead, Mickey.

17:16.188 --> 17:19.156
Now, I'm an accomplice
to a murder.

17:19.191 --> 17:21.894
If the cops haul you in,
what you gonna say?

17:21.926 --> 17:23.561
Nothing, man.

17:24.496 --> 17:26.164
I wouldn't tell 'em nothing.

17:26.198 --> 17:28.567
- Bullshit.
- Ah!

17:52.057 --> 17:53.692
Hello?

17:53.725 --> 17:57.930
You and me have gotta be the
two luckiest men alive today.

17:57.963 --> 18:01.566
Escrow on the Ruby Gates
building just closed,

18:01.600 --> 18:05.070
and we made
a big-ass ton of cash.

18:05.103 --> 18:07.172
That's, uh...

18:07.205 --> 18:08.640
Tha... that's great.

18:08.674 --> 18:10.943
<i>Yeah. I'm going
on this, uh, cruise,</i>

18:10.976 --> 18:15.080
on this boat out of Thailand
they call "The Love Boat."

18:15.113 --> 18:17.249
International waters.

18:17.283 --> 18:18.850
You can come with me,
if you like.

18:18.884 --> 18:21.086
<i>Uh, that sounds...
that sounds fun,</i>

18:21.119 --> 18:25.857
but, um... I got some, um, some paperwork
I... I... I gotta do around here.

18:25.891 --> 18:27.260
Suit yourself.

18:27.293 --> 18:30.028
<i>Don't spend it all
in one place.</i>

18:52.617 --> 18:54.553
<i>This is ICU.</i>

18:54.586 --> 18:57.889
Um, hey, um, is there
a... a patient there

18:57.923 --> 19:01.560
by the name of,
uh, Staci Bradford?

19:01.593 --> 19:03.595
<i>Are you a relative?</i>

19:03.628 --> 19:05.764
Yeah. Um, I'm... I'm her cousin.

19:05.797 --> 19:08.100
I just wanted to see, uh,
how she was... how she was doin'.

19:08.133 --> 19:11.670
<i>I'm sorry, Mrs. Bradford passed
away about 20 minutes ago.</i>

19:11.703 --> 19:14.706
<i>Her brother is here.
Do you want to speak with him?</i>

19:49.808 --> 19:50.776
Hello?

19:57.949 --> 19:59.618
Who is this?

19:59.651 --> 20:01.887
Who the fuck is this?

20:56.442 --> 20:57.642
Okay.

20:59.711 --> 21:01.314
You wanna play, huh?

21:04.116 --> 21:05.384
Let's play, then.

21:07.752 --> 21:09.621
Alright, I'm here.

21:19.465 --> 21:20.932
All right.

21:20.966 --> 21:23.135
It's Staci Bradford's brother,
isn't it?

21:23.168 --> 21:26.138
Hey, listen, man, why don't you
stop playing fucking games, right?

21:26.171 --> 21:29.774
Come on out here and face me like a man.
Stop being a little bitch.

21:31.277 --> 21:33.312
Okay.

21:33.346 --> 21:34.880
Okay. Alright.

21:34.913 --> 21:36.882
How about we have
a civilized conversation,

21:36.915 --> 21:40.286
you know, and come to some
sort of agreement, man?

21:53.432 --> 21:55.901
Fuck this.

21:57.002 --> 21:59.104
Oh, shit.

22:25.230 --> 22:27.065
Mom! Dad!

22:55.261 --> 22:57.195
Oh, shit.

23:00.832 --> 23:03.902
<i>Pick me up,
pick me up, pick me up.</i>

23:05.103 --> 23:07.839
<i>Pick me up, pick me up,
pick me up.</i>

23:07.872 --> 23:11.410
<i>Pick me up,
pick me up, pick me up.</i>

23:15.113 --> 23:16.315
Whoo!

23:17.350 --> 23:18.783
Alright.

23:18.817 --> 23:20.253
I see I got tricked.

23:20.286 --> 23:23.088
Gonna take more than that,
you maladjusted motherfuckers.

23:27.426 --> 23:28.793
Oh, shit.

23:31.264 --> 23:34.165
Alright, I see there's more
of you clowns up in this bitch.

23:34.199 --> 23:36.502
No problem.
I got bullets for all y'all.

23:36.535 --> 23:38.236
More of y'all to shoot.

24:24.182 --> 24:25.318
Oh, shit!

24:32.358 --> 24:33.359
Oh!

24:46.372 --> 24:49.874
You need to stop messing with me
before you get hurt!

24:49.908 --> 24:52.545
Go open up a... a haunted
attraction or something!

24:54.513 --> 24:56.214
Fuck.

26:05.518 --> 26:07.152
Fuck.

26:09.555 --> 26:11.222
Shit.

26:22.601 --> 26:24.068
No.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.087
Your momma
told you that?

27:16.120 --> 27:18.257
No, we saw it
on the news.

27:18.290 --> 27:20.024
Aw, you shouldn't
be watching the news.

27:20.058 --> 27:21.594
Mommy lets me.

27:21.627 --> 27:24.663
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have to
talk to her about that. Okay?

27:24.697 --> 27:26.398
Because...

27:28.233 --> 27:29.502
Yeah.

27:32.404 --> 27:34.239
Because...

27:36.408 --> 27:38.277
you're too young.

27:54.693 --> 27:56.395
Are we gonna be okay?

27:56.428 --> 28:00.266
- Are the bad things still here?
- I don't think so.

28:00.299 --> 28:02.268
Look!

28:02.301 --> 28:05.136
Is that them?
Are they the bad things?

28:05.169 --> 28:08.172
No, I can't see them.

28:08.206 --> 28:12.545
You know, the bad things,
they... they know how to hide.

28:12.578 --> 28:17.316
They know how to make
themselves look normal.

28:17.349 --> 28:22.388
Evil has a way of looking really
nice and shiny on the outside,

28:22.421 --> 28:24.823
on the surface,
when it has to.

28:24.857 --> 28:28.827
That's why we're gonna
go that way. Okay?

28:28.861 --> 28:31.564
I'll tell you what.

28:31.597 --> 28:33.699
You can tell a story,

28:33.732 --> 28:36.200
but you gotta whisper, okay?

28:36.234 --> 28:38.637
You gotta use
your quiet voice.

28:38.671 --> 28:40.306
Okay?

28:40.339 --> 28:41.607
Okay, this one's
different.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.676
Good.

28:43.709 --> 28:47.446
So, once upon a time...

29:30.889 --> 29:33.592
What you looking at?

29:33.626 --> 29:35.894
You think I won't?

29:35.928 --> 29:37.630
I will!

29:37.663 --> 29:40.332
I most pertinently will!

30:46.565 --> 30:48.767
Greetings, patriots,
this is Denton Wilbury

30:48.801 --> 30:50.903
reporting from
bunker 5-Alpha-8.

30:50.936 --> 30:54.707
I am still here
and still engaged.

30:59.344 --> 31:02.314
For those who have managed to sneak
me in food and other pro-ventions,

31:02.347 --> 31:04.917
I am truly grateful.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.586
The fact that you've been able
to get them to me on the regular

31:07.619 --> 31:10.255
is just proof as to
the utter un-competency

31:10.289 --> 31:13.659
of those in charge
and running this damn country.

31:13.692 --> 31:15.494
Given time,

31:15.527 --> 31:17.663
I know there'll be
enough of us to unite

31:17.696 --> 31:19.865
and reclaim our greatness
once and for all.

31:19.898 --> 31:23.736
It is never too late to return to what
we once were, a country of values,

31:23.769 --> 31:28.040
based on a con-stu-pation as
told by a white god to white men,

31:28.073 --> 31:31.910
where Second Amendment
con-spit-a-rors, black monkey hoodlums,

31:31.944 --> 31:33.879
illegal beaners, ragheads,

31:33.912 --> 31:37.549
and L-G-B-Q-T-U-R-X-W-Y-Z,

31:37.583 --> 31:40.853
weirdos and sinners were rightfully
unwelcome in the land of the free

31:40.886 --> 31:42.621
and the home of the brave.

31:44.556 --> 31:48.360
For 30 long years, they've been
trying to move me off my land.

31:49.461 --> 31:51.463
"Ignorant Domain", my ass.

31:51.497 --> 31:54.299
Hell, this land is my land.

31:54.333 --> 31:57.035
Only thing ignorant on this land
is me and my guns.

31:57.069 --> 32:01.874
So, I shall continue to resist the notion
of surrendering this post, friends.

32:01.907 --> 32:04.743
I will not give in to a government
that wants to take my guns

32:04.777 --> 32:08.981
or take a white man's rights and give
them to a bunch of murderous infidels.

32:09.014 --> 32:11.383
Aw, they had badges
and bullhorns,

32:11.416 --> 32:13.852
troopers and sharpshooters,
Commies and coons.

32:13.886 --> 32:15.354
Oh, they came for me, they did.

32:15.387 --> 32:16.822
They even built
some wall around me.

32:16.855 --> 32:19.792
Believe that? They couldn't
build the wall we needed.

32:19.825 --> 32:22.995
The one in-vasioned by this
country's last truly great leader.

32:23.028 --> 32:27.332
When he was elected to power,
he had more people at his incarceration

32:27.366 --> 32:29.902
than any president ever.

32:29.935 --> 32:33.071
If you don't believe me, you can
read about it in the mystery books.

32:33.105 --> 32:36.708
Educate yourself
on the mystery of white America.

32:36.742 --> 32:40.779
So, you can see what is real,
and avoid all fake Jews.

32:40.813 --> 32:43.816
Yet, they had the gumption
to build one around me,

32:43.849 --> 32:46.752
as if I'm the problem.
As if I'm the threat.

32:46.785 --> 32:49.655
Don't matter none, I'm dug in,
and I will remain dug in,

32:49.688 --> 32:51.957
protecting this bunker
until my final breath,

32:51.990 --> 32:56.428
if that is what it takes
to reignite the evolution!

33:05.003 --> 33:08.340
Oh, shit. They're at it.

33:10.008 --> 33:11.944
<i>Please, don't...</i>

33:19.952 --> 33:23.622
<i>Please,
refrain from any antagonizing behavior.</i>

33:23.655 --> 33:28.594
That's right. That's right.
Refried! Refried!

33:28.627 --> 33:30.596
I see you.

33:30.629 --> 33:33.498
Trying to wear me down
with precursor grenades,

33:33.532 --> 33:35.601
make me go crazy from the sound.

33:35.634 --> 33:39.171
How many years
wasting your time?

33:39.204 --> 33:41.874
Wasting tax payer dollars!

33:41.907 --> 33:45.644
I'm too mentally challenged
for you to break me.

33:45.677 --> 33:47.145
<i>I said stop.</i>

33:47.179 --> 33:49.481
<i>We are not here
to antagonize the man.</i>

33:49.514 --> 33:52.517
Yeah, I don't need
to be aggrandized.

33:52.551 --> 33:55.120
You don't wanna aggrandize me.

33:55.153 --> 33:58.390
You damn Commie fools.

34:24.583 --> 34:27.686
I can see gorillas at the gates.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.223
Damn. Traitor.

34:31.257 --> 34:35.726
I know of you, missy. I been a victim
of your lack of ethnic whore-ality.

34:35.761 --> 34:39.563
Your debate-ment of your
in-herni-ent superiority.

34:40.998 --> 34:43.068
I could give you
a taste of this.

34:43.101 --> 34:45.203
That'd get you
back on track.

34:45.237 --> 34:47.539
It's not a bad idea.

34:51.842 --> 34:53.779
Mm-mm.

34:56.782 --> 34:59.952
Brothers, is it
a lonely mission?

34:59.985 --> 35:01.586
At times.

35:01.620 --> 35:04.089
At times I want companionship.

35:04.122 --> 35:07.559
Company of a good white woman
who knows what and who she is,

35:07.592 --> 35:09.661
one that doesn't sleep
or parade about with monkeys

35:09.695 --> 35:12.164
like one traitorous whore
I know.

35:12.197 --> 35:15.233
So, fuck that bitch
I once loved,

35:15.268 --> 35:18.003
Patricia and
her monkey-loving madness.

35:18.036 --> 35:20.273
In fact, she's not a bitch,
she's a witch.

35:20.306 --> 35:22.040
That's a white bitch.

35:22.074 --> 35:24.977
I took out the "B" and added a
"W", come up with "witch".

35:25.010 --> 35:27.512
Clever, I know,
but I'm not talking about her.

35:27.546 --> 35:29.514
I need me a white woman
that is true blue.

35:35.321 --> 35:38.190
Yes, I do yearn
for female companionship.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.259
Thirty years is a long time
to be alone,

35:40.293 --> 35:42.661
even if I do have
a queer-em of inferior harlots

35:42.694 --> 35:46.098
to attend my... kernel desires.

35:48.600 --> 35:52.871
In fact, there's only one thing a female
of any race other than white are good for.

35:52.904 --> 35:56.141
That's to get down on her
haunches, hindquarters raised,

35:56.174 --> 36:00.746
to be of proper service for my Uncle
Sam when he's standing at ascension.

36:00.779 --> 36:02.047
Yeah.

36:02.948 --> 36:04.649
Come here, baby.

36:05.318 --> 36:07.019
Yeah.

36:07.052 --> 36:08.920
You like that, huh?

36:08.954 --> 36:10.989
You like that?

36:11.023 --> 36:13.158
You know you're here to serve
this white master?

36:13.191 --> 36:15.961
- Hm? Yeah.
- <i>That's enough.</i>

36:15.994 --> 36:18.930
- <i>That's enough.</i>
- Oh, enough for who?

36:18.964 --> 36:22.034
Not enough for me,
Takwandaneesha Washington!

36:24.102 --> 36:27.005
You feel that white power
between your legs, huh?

36:29.674 --> 36:33.645
<i>To any y'all listening
in, that's the sound of monkey poon!</i>

36:33.678 --> 36:36.715
<i>Monkey poon!</i>

36:39.217 --> 36:41.653
<i>♪ Monkey poon, monkey poon ♪</i>

36:41.686 --> 36:44.189
<i>♪ Coming soon
in monkey poon ♪</i>

36:47.759 --> 36:49.828
Go ahead, fire away!

36:49.861 --> 36:54.199
I'm firing in here
on all syllables!

36:56.868 --> 37:00.373
Time to pick fruit,
you border-crossing ho!

37:00.406 --> 37:02.607
Have some ass taco!

37:02.641 --> 37:04.109
Yeah.

37:04.142 --> 37:05.844
Yeah.

37:05.877 --> 37:08.281
Now, don't worry, I'll save
some white seed for y'all.

37:09.881 --> 37:12.184
Chinky-Lou, I'm gonna let you
chop this stick.

37:12.217 --> 37:16.289
And Ass-ama, I'm gonna run
a Jihad on that janky ass.

37:16.322 --> 37:20.826
And for you, Jesus-killer,
gonna break that hymen, Hymie.

37:20.859 --> 37:22.761
But right now,
I'm the mayonnaise

37:22.794 --> 37:27.899
on a... in a Black
and beaner sammich.

37:29.368 --> 37:30.669
Ow!

37:30.702 --> 37:33.105
You nappy-haired harlot!

37:33.138 --> 37:37.843
Oh, you think it's funny making me slam
my Uncle Sam into concrete wall, huh?

37:56.429 --> 37:59.030
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

38:23.788 --> 38:25.757
I'm sorry.

38:28.226 --> 38:32.230
Will you forgive me?

38:32.265 --> 38:36.269
I'm sorry I laid down alongside
those inhuman harlots...

38:36.302 --> 38:39.771
in front of you.

38:39.804 --> 38:42.874
But it was only
to show them their place.

38:43.808 --> 38:45.677
Not to de-fiend you, my queen.

38:47.513 --> 38:49.981
You are my godless.

38:50.849 --> 38:54.320
My pure, white,

38:54.353 --> 38:56.955
delicious... godless.

39:04.829 --> 39:07.799
Oh, ah, yes.

39:10.469 --> 39:13.339
Oh. Oh, Jesus.

39:13.372 --> 39:16.208
Sugar dumpling, I done hurt you.

39:16.241 --> 39:18.444
I... I can fix it.

39:18.477 --> 39:20.145
I'll make it all better.

39:20.178 --> 39:22.047
Promise. Promise.

39:23.349 --> 39:24.983
Just wait.

39:25.016 --> 39:26.285
Ah!

39:29.288 --> 39:33.792
Okay, it's gonna be better, it's
gonna be better, it's gonna be better.

39:36.295 --> 39:39.864
To any of my supporters out there
that sometimes sneak me food,

39:39.898 --> 39:42.200
I'd really appreciate, well...

39:47.138 --> 39:49.375
...a nice, new poster
of a fine white woman.

39:49.408 --> 39:50.942
Uh, given my druthers,

39:50.976 --> 39:52.378
one that's draped
in red, white, and blue,

39:52.411 --> 39:55.113
and parched up on a big,
monkey-maiming, spic-smooshing,

39:55.146 --> 39:58.116
camel jockey jacking,
Jew-killing, white missile.

39:58.149 --> 40:00.253
Also, if possible,

40:01.287 --> 40:03.522
a... couple of new dolls

40:03.556 --> 40:05.558
for my queer-em.
A black one and a brown one.

40:05.591 --> 40:08.860
Seems I've about given the ones here
all their subhuman asses can handle,

40:08.893 --> 40:13.332
so if you could arrange that, then you
will have my humble thanks and gravi-tide.

40:13.366 --> 40:16.269
Well, time's late.
Gonna go out, fill the canteen,

40:16.302 --> 40:19.137
take one last look at the dirty
diaper-spora of ethnic scum

40:19.170 --> 40:22.874
they got keeping an internal
watch on your humble servant,

40:22.907 --> 40:25.210
then come back in
and lock down for the night.

40:25.243 --> 40:27.413
'Til tomorrow, this is
Denton Wilbury,

40:27.446 --> 40:29.247
constipation-loving,

40:29.282 --> 40:31.850
ain't taking my guns,
second amended-ment supporting,

40:31.883 --> 40:33.419
illegal alias hating,

40:33.452 --> 40:38.557
L-G-B-Q-R-S and the rest of them
goddamn letters despise-ering,

40:38.591 --> 40:41.260
God-fearing, true American
signing off.

40:48.634 --> 40:52.338
Goddamn it!

40:54.340 --> 40:55.441
Alrighty, then.

40:55.474 --> 40:57.909
Bang, bang, bang!

41:01.146 --> 41:03.081
Bang, bang, bang!
Bang, bang, bang!

41:03.114 --> 41:06.151
Come on, buddy,
let's go, let's go.

41:06.184 --> 41:11.222
Bang, bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang, bang!

41:16.429 --> 41:18.331
That was it!

41:18.364 --> 41:20.399
The final straw.

41:20.433 --> 41:25.837
You can call that the straw
that broke the mammal's back!

41:26.237 --> 41:27.072
So, what?

41:27.105 --> 41:29.408
Y'all want a piece of me?

41:30.509 --> 41:32.143
Come get some.

41:32.177 --> 41:34.480
I'll shoot your black asses.

41:34.513 --> 41:36.948
I sure as hell will!

41:36.981 --> 41:40.051
You wanna try me, any of ya?

41:40.085 --> 41:42.254
Bring it on, infant-tells!

41:42.288 --> 41:45.257
Bring it the fuck on!

42:18.156 --> 42:20.426
I thought we got all those
real bullets out of there.

42:23.295 --> 42:25.930
- Ugh, I'm gonna hear about this.
- Is he dead?

42:25.964 --> 42:27.198
Yeah, is he dead?

42:28.199 --> 42:29.335
Don't.

42:29.368 --> 42:31.970
Don't bang
on the force field.

42:32.003 --> 42:34.105
Yeah, Jimmy.
It disturbs the animals.

42:34.139 --> 42:37.008
You think
they're all extinct?

42:37.041 --> 42:41.045
No, I think the Mississippi Zoo
might still have one.

42:41.079 --> 42:43.315
Hey, do we have time to go see
the misogynist exhibit?

42:43.349 --> 42:45.183
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

42:45.216 --> 42:48.687
Oh, well, the zoo doesn't close
for another 20 minutes.

42:48.721 --> 42:52.056
So, if we hurry, okay?
Let's go.

42:52.090 --> 42:55.594
I can't wait! I hope
it's as cool as the last one.

43:00.332 --> 43:03.001
So, where did that
tall tale come from?

43:03.034 --> 43:04.235
What's a tall tale?

43:04.270 --> 43:07.473
It's a story
that isn't real.

43:07.506 --> 43:10.476
It happened.
Mom told me.

43:10.509 --> 43:13.244
But will she be okay?

43:13.279 --> 43:16.449
Yeah. Yeah,
she's gonna be fine.

43:16.482 --> 43:19.285
Because you never come to pick me up.
It's always Mom.

43:19.318 --> 43:22.254
Yeah, well, this time
she called me,

43:22.288 --> 43:24.590
and she asked me
to come get you.

43:24.623 --> 43:26.991
All those monsters and stuff.

43:27.025 --> 43:29.127
But she's gonna be okay.

43:29.160 --> 43:32.163
And look here,
we're gonna be fine too.

43:32.197 --> 43:34.333
We just got to get
to our spot,

43:34.366 --> 43:35.734
and she's gonna
meet us there.

43:35.768 --> 43:38.102
Those demons, they're scary.

43:39.371 --> 43:41.072
Demons?

43:41.105 --> 43:43.476
You said that's
what's chasing us.

43:43.509 --> 43:46.010
No, I said "monsters".

43:46.044 --> 43:48.213
Mom takes me to church.
They talk about demons.

43:48.246 --> 43:51.015
You don't come to church.
That's why you can't see them.

43:51.049 --> 43:53.619
You never go to church.
Mommy goes every Sunday.

43:53.652 --> 43:57.590
Yeah, well, your mother
is a saint.

43:57.623 --> 43:59.258
I'm more of a, uh...

44:00.459 --> 44:02.394
work in progress.

44:04.128 --> 44:06.665
- Alright, we gotta rendezvous.
- What's "rendezvous"?

44:06.699 --> 44:09.167
Rendezvous, that's where
we're gonna meet your mother.

44:09.200 --> 44:13.439
Carry me again?
On your back this time.

44:13.472 --> 44:16.709
Come on, but you're heavy
for your size.

44:16.742 --> 44:19.043
On the way, can I
tell another story?

44:19.077 --> 44:22.381
Well, since you're
right by my ear,

44:22.414 --> 44:25.149
I guess I don't
have any choice.

44:25.183 --> 44:27.686

45:16.869 --> 45:18.771
Bitch, you lost your
motherfucking mind?

45:18.804 --> 45:20.472
Shit.

45:20.506 --> 45:24.108
What the hell?!
Okay, put me down!

45:24.142 --> 45:26.712
- I can walk!
- Supposed to be singing backup! Back the fuck up!

45:26.745 --> 45:28.414
Thank you.

45:31.350 --> 45:33.352
- Hey, hold on.
- What?

45:33.385 --> 45:35.254
You wanna yell
at me too?

45:35.287 --> 45:37.155
Nah, I don't work
for E-Lips.

45:37.188 --> 45:38.757
I was just sitting in
on the session.

45:38.791 --> 45:42.193
Then why don't you
go back in there?

45:42.226 --> 45:44.263
Because I'm interested
in finding talent.

45:44.296 --> 45:48.434
And you have more in your little finger
than E-Lips has in her whole damn body.

45:50.436 --> 45:51.604
Thank you.

45:51.637 --> 45:54.573
But that is what just
got me fired, so...

45:54.607 --> 45:57.910
Just... Will you come talk to me for a second?

45:57.943 --> 46:01.145
God, why did I do that?

46:01.179 --> 46:03.816
I always self-destruct,
and I needed that job, too.

46:03.849 --> 46:06.285
No, you don't.

46:06.318 --> 46:08.654
Backup singing is just dimming your light.

46:10.689 --> 46:13.759
She fired you because she knows
her voice can't compete with yours.

46:13.792 --> 46:18.364
True. But tell that to my landlord
'cause he don't give a fuck.

46:18.397 --> 46:21.934
What you need is to be seen
by the right people.

46:21.967 --> 46:23.869
You need a manager.

46:23.902 --> 46:25.304
And are you a manager?

46:25.337 --> 46:27.906
Aspiring. Look,
give me a few months.

46:27.940 --> 46:29.675
And if I can't make it happen,
then dump me.

46:29.708 --> 46:31.877
- What you got to lose?
- A roof over my head.

46:31.910 --> 46:34.245
A way to pay my bills.

46:34.279 --> 46:36.180
You want me to go on?

46:37.282 --> 46:38.917
What's your name?

46:38.951 --> 46:41.320
Chela Simpson.

46:41.353 --> 46:43.956
Chela Simpson,
my name is Park.

46:43.989 --> 46:46.190
You say you need a job?

46:46.224 --> 46:47.526
I think I can
get you one.

46:47.559 --> 46:50.396
<i>I run errands for
this rich, old lady</i>

46:50.429 --> 46:52.196
<i>who lives in this
sweet-ass mansion.</i>

46:52.230 --> 46:55.467
<i>She's looking to find
a paid companion.</i>

47:35.541 --> 47:37.710
So, what do you think?

47:39.011 --> 47:41.513
Damn.

47:47.753 --> 47:49.655
Nice place.

47:51.557 --> 47:53.792
I told you
she has major bank.

47:55.427 --> 47:57.429
She was so beautiful.

47:57.463 --> 47:59.665
Let's go meet her.
She's right in here.

48:19.051 --> 48:21.920
Is that her?

48:21.954 --> 48:25.591
Miss Benoit,
this is my friend, Chela.

48:25.624 --> 48:27.359
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Miss Benoit.

48:27.392 --> 48:29.328
Of course it is.

48:29.361 --> 48:30.662
Please, have a seat.

48:37.402 --> 48:39.905
Aren't you a pretty thing?

48:41.473 --> 48:42.975
And as you can see,

48:43.008 --> 48:46.912
I love being surrounded
by pretty things,

48:46.945 --> 48:49.414
including Park.

48:49.448 --> 48:51.884
Back in my prime,

48:51.917 --> 48:55.454
I would have seduced you both.

48:55.487 --> 48:58.490
Probably at the same time.

49:01.560 --> 49:02.861
You're flushing, my dear.

49:02.895 --> 49:06.398
Well, you'll have to
get used to my frankness.

49:06.431 --> 49:09.768
Why have filters at my age?

49:10.836 --> 49:12.538
Yes, ma'am. Of course.

49:12.571 --> 49:13.672
Mmm.

49:13.705 --> 49:16.842
Park, will you go
pick up my blood?

49:18.844 --> 49:20.679
No problem, Miss Benoit.

49:20.712 --> 49:22.282
I'll be right back.

49:25.117 --> 49:27.619
Um...

49:27.653 --> 49:30.088
did you just tell him
to pick up blood?

49:30.122 --> 49:32.724
The indignities of old age.

49:32.758 --> 49:34.927
Yes, I... I'm anemic,

49:34.960 --> 49:37.029
and I need transfusions,

49:37.062 --> 49:39.031
and I hate hospitals,

49:39.064 --> 49:40.833
so I have them here.

49:40.866 --> 49:42.734
Oh. Right.

49:42.768 --> 49:45.571
But don't wait too long
to lay with him.

49:45.604 --> 49:48.740
I can smell the chemistry

49:48.774 --> 49:50.843
between the both of you.

50:06.692 --> 50:09.528
So, how you getting along
with Miss Benoit?

50:09.561 --> 50:11.730
Oh, my God. I'm about
to lose my fucking mind.

50:12.698 --> 50:14.132
- That's what.
- How come?

50:14.166 --> 50:17.703
Because all we do
all day, every day,

50:17.736 --> 50:21.907
<i>is watch this old-ass video</i>
<i>of her doing</i> Carmen.

50:24.676 --> 50:26.745
<i>She never gets tired of it.</i>

50:26.778 --> 50:30.415
<i>And it's like torture
because I fucking hate opera.</i>

50:30.449 --> 50:34.152
<i>Especially, when I have
to watch the same one</i>

50:34.186 --> 50:38.123
<i>over and over and over
and over again.</i>

50:48.233 --> 50:49.568
Are you bored?

50:49.601 --> 50:52.504
No. No, ma'am.
Of course not.

50:52.537 --> 50:55.908
I mean...
you had such a beautiful voice.

50:55.941 --> 50:59.511
I was just wondering if you

50:59.544 --> 51:01.880
maybe had, uh,

51:01.914 --> 51:02.915
any other tapes?

51:04.516 --> 51:06.785
You don't understand.

51:06.818 --> 51:12.891
This was my one
and only public performance.

51:12.925 --> 51:14.059
What?

51:14.092 --> 51:17.195
In 1958, it was unheard of

51:17.229 --> 51:19.698
for a colored girl
to star in an opera.

51:19.731 --> 51:23.669
But I was allowed to be hired
as the third understudy.

51:23.702 --> 51:27.139
The two girls ahead of me
came down with a flu.

51:27.172 --> 51:30.242
They were sick as dogs.

51:30.276 --> 51:34.146
It was Saturday night,
and they were desperate.

51:34.179 --> 51:36.048
So, I went on.

51:36.081 --> 51:38.050
And I had this man...

51:38.083 --> 51:42.220
Uh, well, I can't remember his name.
Anyway, he was in love with me,

51:42.255 --> 51:46.758
and he had a motion camera.

51:46.792 --> 51:50.062
I got him to film it.

51:50.095 --> 51:52.097
And as you can see...

51:52.130 --> 51:54.132
- Uh...
- Oh...

51:54.166 --> 51:57.035
I was...

51:57.869 --> 52:01.006
spectacular.

52:01.039 --> 52:02.207
Miss Benoit, you...

52:02.240 --> 52:04.643
Oh, dear.

52:04.676 --> 52:07.012
Oh, you thought I couldn't walk.

52:07.045 --> 52:10.749
Oh, no, it's just that
my knees hurt me so much,

52:10.782 --> 52:13.518
so much of the time,
that I have... I ju... Ooh.

52:15.053 --> 52:17.956
I just don't even bother.

52:19.157 --> 52:20.892
I was so good

52:20.926 --> 52:24.763
that the theater owner
wanted to make me his star.

52:26.164 --> 52:31.036
And then came
the damn uproar.

52:31.069 --> 52:37.509
Folks enraged because they
let that nigger play <i>Carmen.</i>

52:38.311 --> 52:41.780
Demanded their
ticket money back.

52:43.915 --> 52:45.584
Cretins.

52:46.585 --> 52:49.888
That's really messed up.

52:49.921 --> 52:52.691
I even got fired
as an understudy,

52:52.724 --> 52:55.994
and I never had another
opportunity after that.

52:57.596 --> 52:59.564
Time just passed me by.

53:01.700 --> 53:04.636
Oh, people despise old

53:04.669 --> 53:07.873
almost as much
as they do black.

53:16.815 --> 53:20.052
I know what it's like not to be
able to do what you love.

53:20.085 --> 53:25.057
I, um, I never told you this,
but I'm a singer, too.

53:26.292 --> 53:29.694
Oh! You are? Opera?

53:29.728 --> 53:33.031
No, ma'am. Just pop, R&B.

53:33.065 --> 53:34.199
I write my own stuff, too.

53:34.232 --> 53:35.600
Well, please.

53:35.634 --> 53:38.103
Let me hear you, dear. Please.

53:39.305 --> 53:40.639
Yes, yes, yes!

53:40.672 --> 53:42.341
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

53:42.375 --> 53:45.777
- Stand up. Yes.
- Okay.

53:46.845 --> 53:49.714
<i>♪ 'Cause I'm up now ♪</i>

53:49.748 --> 53:52.617
<i>♪ And you need
the constant control ♪</i>

53:52.651 --> 53:55.620

53:55.654 --> 53:59.958
<i>♪ And you need
the constant control ♪</i>

54:03.262 --> 54:08.100
You have
a serviceable instrument.

54:08.133 --> 54:08.934
And with proper training,

54:10.869 --> 54:14.606
you might develop
into a real singer.

54:23.215 --> 54:26.051
You fucking bitch!

54:26.084 --> 54:27.786
Ahh!

54:40.932 --> 54:42.200
Fuck you!

54:45.304 --> 54:49.007
I am a real singer.

54:49.040 --> 54:51.810
Oh.

54:51.843 --> 54:53.245
Oh, my dear.

54:54.913 --> 54:57.883
I have hurt your feelings,
haven't I? Oh, I...

54:57.916 --> 54:59.784
That was not my intention.

54:59.818 --> 55:03.788
Listen, I want you to go
into my bedroom upstairs.

55:03.822 --> 55:06.892
On the corner table,
you'll see a jewelry box.

55:06.925 --> 55:08.294
Please go, bring it to me.

55:08.327 --> 55:12.063
Go. I'm so sorry, dear.

55:29.515 --> 55:31.950
Oh, my God.

55:38.391 --> 55:40.825
All right.

55:43.529 --> 55:48.833
Now, this was given to me
long ago by an admirer.

55:48.867 --> 55:52.237
It's from Austria.

55:58.977 --> 56:01.246
And I want you to have it.

56:07.986 --> 56:09.888
Thank you, Miss Benoit.

56:09.921 --> 56:11.823
It really is beautiful.

56:11.856 --> 56:15.827
Oh, you're welcome, dear. Oh.

56:15.860 --> 56:17.363
Are you okay?

56:17.396 --> 56:20.466
I'm feeling a little exhausted.

56:20.499 --> 56:22.200
I need a transfusion.

56:22.234 --> 56:24.970
Please go to the refrigerator
and get me a bag of blood.

56:25.003 --> 56:26.439
Don't you need, like, a nurse

56:26.472 --> 56:28.907
- to come in and do all of that?
- Oh, no, no, no, no. Look.

56:30.443 --> 56:32.978
I have a permanent catheter,

56:33.011 --> 56:35.481
and it's... it's very easy.

56:35.514 --> 56:37.882
I'll show you.

56:53.566 --> 56:57.503
Gross.

56:57.536 --> 57:01.507
chela: <i>And then, she had me hang the
bag up and attach the tube to her arm.</i>

57:03.609 --> 57:06.379
Look, what's wrong, baby?

57:06.412 --> 57:09.415
You can't be that frosted
over the transfusion?

57:09.448 --> 57:11.049
I sang for her today.

57:12.351 --> 57:16.888
And then she told me
that I wasn't a real singer.

57:16.921 --> 57:18.823
Oh, she's a crazy
old lady, Chela.

57:18.857 --> 57:20.526
You can't let her get to you.

57:20.559 --> 57:23.828
When she said that thing about me
not being a real singer, I saw red.

57:23.862 --> 57:25.830
I want to kill that bitch.

57:28.634 --> 57:30.135
Do you want to?

57:31.570 --> 57:33.439
Do I want to what?

57:33.472 --> 57:36.275
Do you want to kill her?

57:36.309 --> 57:39.312
Because that's a way
to make a lot of money.

57:39.345 --> 57:43.114
Alright, Miss Benoit's got a ton of cash...

57:43.148 --> 57:45.183
...jewels, and other
valuable shit up in the house.

57:45.216 --> 57:48.287
She doesn't like banks.
She's got no family.

57:48.321 --> 57:51.956
We could clean the place out
and nobody would be the wiser.

57:53.459 --> 57:56.928
You can't be serious.

57:56.961 --> 58:00.231
With that kind of cash,
we could buy a studio.

58:00.266 --> 58:04.836
Pay big producers,
take you right up to the top.

59:28.052 --> 59:31.189
Chela, are you ready
to record now?

59:32.658 --> 59:34.192
Mm-hm.

01:00:04.623 --> 01:00:05.957
What's wrong?

01:00:12.731 --> 01:00:15.534
You'll never be a singer, girl.

01:00:17.536 --> 01:00:18.504
Never!

01:00:20.071 --> 01:00:22.541
Never!

01:00:44.597 --> 01:00:47.098
- Oh, shit.
- Baby, what's wrong?

01:00:47.131 --> 01:00:49.167
Oh, my God, that was awful.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.536
Holy fuck, that was terrible.

01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:53.137
It's okay. It's okay,
you just had a nightmare.

01:00:53.171 --> 01:00:55.574
No.

01:00:59.678 --> 01:01:02.113
Do you really think
we could do it?

01:01:02.146 --> 01:01:04.316
Get away with
killing her?

01:01:06.685 --> 01:01:09.421
Yeah, I d... I do.

01:01:10.456 --> 01:01:12.324
Then let's do it.

01:01:12.358 --> 01:01:14.058
Let's kill her.

01:01:19.465 --> 01:01:22.701
Okay, so explain this to me again.
How is this supposed to kill her?

01:01:22.735 --> 01:01:25.304
Okay, I'm a universal donor,

01:01:25.337 --> 01:01:27.540
which means I can
give blood to anyone.

01:01:27.573 --> 01:01:29.475
But you're type B.

01:01:29.508 --> 01:01:31.577
Miss Benoit's type O.

01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:33.512
If we put type B in her,

01:01:33.546 --> 01:01:36.549
then her antibodies
will attack her own blood.

01:01:36.582 --> 01:01:38.450
She'll get sick and die.

01:01:38.484 --> 01:01:40.419
It's like poisoning her.

01:01:40.452 --> 01:01:43.455
Everybody'll think
she died of anemia.

01:01:43.489 --> 01:01:45.491
You dig?

01:01:45.524 --> 01:01:47.693
The next time I pick up
the blood for Miss Benoit,

01:01:47.726 --> 01:01:49.495
I'll mix some
of your blood into it.

01:01:49.528 --> 01:01:52.665
Spread it out over a week,
so it builds up slowly.

01:01:52.698 --> 01:01:55.367
Yeah, is that... is that enough?
I'm starting to get woozy.

01:01:55.401 --> 01:01:59.170
Yeah. Yeah, that... that's plenty.

01:01:59.203 --> 01:02:01.640
Okay, Chela,
I'm doing this tomorrow.

01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:04.208
If you wanna change your mind...

01:02:04.743 --> 01:02:06.312
now's the time.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.114
No.

01:02:10.148 --> 01:02:12.183
I'm good.

01:02:12.918 --> 01:02:14.720
Let's take the old bag out.

01:02:33.405 --> 01:02:34.873
Are you okay, Miss Benoit?

01:02:34.907 --> 01:02:38.444
Well,
I've been feeling...

01:02:38.477 --> 01:02:41.245
badly on and off
for the past few days.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.616
It must be the flu.

01:02:43.649 --> 01:02:45.351
Oh, no.

01:02:45.384 --> 01:02:48.654
You know what? I'm gonna go
get you a glass of water.

01:02:48.687 --> 01:02:51.390
- Chela?
- Yes, ma'am?

01:02:51.423 --> 01:02:53.325
Come.

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:56.762
What?

01:02:56.795 --> 01:02:58.430
Come.

01:03:03.969 --> 01:03:06.538
I want to thank you.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:13.278
You are a gift.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.180
Come on, Miss Benoit,

01:03:16.214 --> 01:03:18.384
you're freaking me out.
Don't talk like that.

01:03:18.417 --> 01:03:20.419
You're gonna be just fine.

01:03:20.452 --> 01:03:22.321
Mmm.

01:03:24.823 --> 01:03:30.262
I am sure that you are right.

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:39.605
You know what? You're really
not looking good.

01:03:39.638 --> 01:03:40.939
I'm gonna go call Park.

01:04:03.629 --> 01:04:06.465
Oh, my God!

01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:15.274
The crazy ass old bitch is
D-E-A-D. Dead!

01:04:15.307 --> 01:04:17.843

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.715
Miss Benoit?

01:06:36.748 --> 01:06:38.851
What's happening?

01:06:38.884 --> 01:06:40.652

01:08:24.256 --> 01:08:26.725
- What is wrong with me? What happened to me?
- Calm down, Chela.

- Oh, my God, you don't know. You gotta help me.
- Calm down, Chela.

Calm down, okay?

We've been lovers for many
decades, Marie and I.

Who do you think it was
that shot that film of her?

01:09:17.042 --> 01:09:21.613
I was the first to steal a body,
but Marie, she was very patient.

01:09:21.645 --> 01:09:24.549
She waited until
I could find her the...

01:09:25.716 --> 01:09:27.886
perfect instrument.

01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:33.191
Goodbye, Chela.

01:09:47.671 --> 01:09:48.939
Yes, thanks for coming.

01:10:34.287 --> 01:10:35.887
Are we almost there?

01:10:35.921 --> 01:10:39.358
Well, we can certainly
get there a lot faster

01:10:39.392 --> 01:10:42.094
if we were to take this.

01:10:42.127 --> 01:10:44.096

- Once upon a time...
- No!

01:11:07.986 --> 01:11:12.291
The stories you tell don't
need no "once upon a time".

01:11:12.325 --> 01:11:16.895
Okay, how about "It was the best of
times, it was the worst of times"?

01:11:16.928 --> 01:11:19.298
Where did you learn that?

01:11:19.332 --> 01:11:20.999
Mommy reads to me.

01:11:21.032 --> 01:11:23.869
"It was the age of wisdom
and the age of foolishness,

the epoch of belief
and incredulity.

The season of light
and the season of darkness.

We were all going
direct to heaven,

01:11:32.777 --> 01:11:36.181
or maybe we were all going
direct the other way..."

Ooh!

01:11:42.321 --> 01:11:43.922

this anywhere else in the city, baby girl.

01:16:13.325 --> 01:16:14.460
Fuck!

01:16:20.699 --> 01:16:23.201
Shit.

01:16:23.234 --> 01:16:25.571
Goddamn it.

01:16:25.604 --> 01:16:27.038
Dude, what's wrong with you?

01:16:27.071 --> 01:16:29.107
I shit my fucking pants.

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.176
Ugh, so I smell! God!

01:16:31.209 --> 01:16:35.481
Bro, what came up inside your body,
laid eggs and died so you smell like this?

01:16:35.514 --> 01:16:38.116
Yo, Big Mike, man,
just shut the fuck up, man.

01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:41.287
Pretty sure I'm about to call you Big Stinky
right now, man. Get in the place, man, let's go.

01:16:43.221 --> 01:16:45.089
Dude, what got you sick?

01:16:45.123 --> 01:16:46.224
You think it was the chicken?

01:16:46.258 --> 01:16:47.560
No, man, I never
touched that shit.

01:16:47.593 --> 01:16:49.562
Thank God.

01:17:01.206 --> 01:17:04.310
Man, you gotta be
fucking kidding me, bro!

01:17:04.343 --> 01:17:08.213
I don't know the last time I
seen a grown man shit his pants.

01:17:09.113 --> 01:17:12.217
What the...

01:17:12.251 --> 01:17:14.753
- What the fuck, man? Come on!
- What's up?

01:17:14.787 --> 01:17:17.055
I can't take
these goddamn shoes off.

01:17:17.088 --> 01:17:19.758
Man, you probably too weak
from the food poisoning or whatever.

01:17:19.792 --> 01:17:22.060
That shit will
take a nigger out.

01:17:22.093 --> 01:17:24.797
How the fuck I'm supposed
to take my pants off

01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:27.065
if I can't take off
these damn shoes?

01:17:32.671 --> 01:17:35.641
You gotta help me pull these off, man.

01:17:35.674 --> 01:17:38.109
My black ass ain't going nowhere
near your sick ass.

01:17:38.142 --> 01:17:40.746
I'm sorry, but I ain't
trying to smell your shit

01:17:40.779 --> 01:17:42.414
while I'm trying to eat.

01:17:42.448 --> 01:17:43.816
Go on. Close the door.

01:17:43.849 --> 01:17:46.719
You ain't no kind
of friend, nigga.

01:17:46.752 --> 01:17:50.221
No, I'm the type of friend that don't
get involved in another man's shit.

01:17:51.457 --> 01:17:53.292
Shit.

01:17:58.364 --> 01:18:01.165
Shit!

01:18:18.851 --> 01:18:21.287
Ugh.

01:18:30.729 --> 01:18:32.665
You took a shower in your pants?

01:18:32.698 --> 01:18:35.467
Man, I couldn't pull these damn
shoes off, so I pulled 'em down.

01:18:35.501 --> 01:18:39.538
It's lucky I jacked that beautician
bitch last week and got this.

01:18:39.572 --> 01:18:43.709
Man, I got to say,
despite your stupid shit,

01:18:43.742 --> 01:18:46.579
pun most definitely intended,

01:18:46.612 --> 01:18:47.713
those kicks look good as new.

01:18:47.746 --> 01:18:50.616
Yeah, nigger.
Still worth a fortune.

01:18:50.649 --> 01:18:52.418
If you ever
get them bad boys off.

01:18:52.451 --> 01:18:55.186
I'm-a get these bad boys off,
nigger. Even if I...

01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:59.458
Oh, shit.

01:18:59.491 --> 01:19:01.327
You feel that?
It's cold in here.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:02.595
Cold?

01:19:02.628 --> 01:19:03.629
It... it's, like, 90 degrees.

01:19:03.662 --> 01:19:05.564
Man, I'm freezing.

01:19:05.598 --> 01:19:08.867
Look, dude, ain't no telling
what you might have.

01:19:08.901 --> 01:19:12.638
Now, what you need to do is get your
black ass to a clinic or a hospital.

01:19:12.671 --> 01:19:15.774
Basically, anywhere
a thousand miles away from me.

01:19:15.808 --> 01:19:18.477
Alright, well,
at least give me a ride.

01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:21.145
My car been broke for,
like, a week.

01:19:22.246 --> 01:19:24.383
I'm serious!

01:19:24.416 --> 01:19:26.485
And, look, I would call 911,

01:19:26.518 --> 01:19:30.756
but the cops come in here and
see all this stolen shit...

01:19:30.789 --> 01:19:32.524
and your ass going
straight to lockup.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.023
Oh, man, got to get my ass
to a fucking ER.

01:21:45.057 --> 01:21:47.659
Shit got me hallucinating.

01:22:21.894 --> 01:22:23.095
What the fu...?

01:23:23.755 --> 01:23:26.758
Ooh, a statue. Boo!

01:23:26.792 --> 01:23:32.130
- Hey, he's pretty good.
- Tip him and let's go.

01:23:32.164 --> 01:23:36.168
- Oh, his breath stinks!
- Yeah.

01:23:36.201 --> 01:23:41.907
Nice kicks, but paying
for expensive shoes

01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:46.011
can be murder.

01:24:00.792 --> 01:24:03.829
Hey, buddy?

01:24:03.862 --> 01:24:06.665
This is Officer Danski.

01:24:06.698 --> 01:24:09.668
I've got a man down
in the concourse.

01:24:13.939 --> 01:24:18.477
<i>You will walk a mile in your victim's shoes. Trust.</i>

01:24:19.611 --> 01:24:21.513
<i>Trust.</i>

01:24:21.914 --> 01:24:23.649
<i>Trust.</i>

01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:27.152
<i>Victim's shoes.</i>

01:24:27.185 --> 01:24:30.522
You will feel the pain of the people you hurt.

01:24:30.555 --> 01:24:33.992
<i>You will walk a mile
in your victim's shoes. Trust.</i>

01:25:50.269 --> 01:25:53.005
Hey. Hey, doc.

01:26:19.731 --> 01:26:21.666
Percy Woodhouse.

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:23.668
We've been waiting.

01:26:23.702 --> 01:26:26.872
And waiting
and waiting.

01:26:30.175 --> 01:26:31.277
What?

01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:32.978
Who the hell is that?

01:26:37.816 --> 01:26:39.751
Jesus.

01:26:39.785 --> 01:26:41.820
You're that crazy bitch
from the TV.

01:26:43.822 --> 01:26:46.091
You expect me to believe
that voodoo shit is real?

01:26:46.124 --> 01:26:50.929
You're running from something,
so you tell me how real it is.

01:26:53.098 --> 01:26:57.803
When I invoked a curse for you to
walk a mile in your victim's shoes,

01:26:57.836 --> 01:27:01.206
I had no idea you would
make it, oh, so literal.

01:27:01.239 --> 01:27:02.841
You did what?

01:27:05.744 --> 01:27:08.947
A proper curse will never
give pain to the conjurer.

01:27:13.718 --> 01:27:15.620
You look confused.

01:27:15.654 --> 01:27:17.222
Let me explain.

01:27:17.256 --> 01:27:19.224
Your last victim.

01:27:19.258 --> 01:27:22.761
Not only did you knock him out,
you killed him.

01:27:24.162 --> 01:27:28.267
- And so now, you get to live his death.
- I what?

01:27:28.301 --> 01:27:32.704
You are experiencing all the physical
ailments of the man you killed.

01:27:32.737 --> 01:27:34.340
- Bullshit!
- Really?

01:27:34.373 --> 01:27:36.808
Let's go over the facts.

01:27:36.842 --> 01:27:39.412
After you put on the shoes,
did you feel...

01:27:39.445 --> 01:27:41.646
...a chill?

01:27:42.415 --> 01:27:44.716
That's the specter of death.

01:27:44.749 --> 01:27:48.086
You probably pissed
and shit yourself.

01:27:50.155 --> 01:27:53.125
That's what dead bodies
tend to do after death,

01:27:53.158 --> 01:27:55.794
once the muscles relax.

01:27:55.827 --> 01:27:58.029
The stiffness you felt,

01:27:58.063 --> 01:28:01.733
temporary rigor mortis.

01:28:01.766 --> 01:28:03.969
The pain in your stomach...

01:28:05.003 --> 01:28:07.839
...and that disgusting smell
surrounding you

01:28:07.873 --> 01:28:11.810
is from bacteria and gas
in your gut as it liquifies.

01:28:11.843 --> 01:28:15.680
As bad as all that sounds,

01:28:15.714 --> 01:28:17.682
here's your real problem.

01:28:17.716 --> 01:28:23.155
You now have all the symptoms of
death, except you are not dead.

01:28:23.188 --> 01:28:24.423
What the hell do you mean?

01:28:24.457 --> 01:28:26.259
What's all this
crazy shit I'm seeing?

01:28:26.292 --> 01:28:28.193
You're seeing chaperones.

01:28:30.929 --> 01:28:34.367
Angels and demons shuttling
deceased souls to heaven,

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:37.370
hell, their final destination.

01:28:37.403 --> 01:28:40.172
Your demons are trying
to drag you into hell,

01:28:40.205 --> 01:28:41.239
but they can't...

01:28:42.475 --> 01:28:45.478
...because you are both
living and dead.

01:28:45.511 --> 01:28:48.447
Trapped between life
and afterlife.

01:28:48.481 --> 01:28:52.050
What? Are you trying to say this crazy shit...
This... this "me walking around like a corpse"

01:28:52.083 --> 01:28:55.787
- can happen for the rest of my life?
- Your life is over!

01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:58.890
This is your eternity.

01:28:58.924 --> 01:29:01.693
You trying to tell me I'm dead?

01:29:02.361 --> 01:29:03.895
Like, dead-dead?

01:29:03.929 --> 01:29:08.367
Son. Sadly, you must either
finish your death

01:29:08.401 --> 01:29:10.336
and go to hell,

01:29:10.369 --> 01:29:14.340
or continue being attacked
by demons

01:29:14.373 --> 01:29:17.476
forever and beyond.

01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:20.812
Of the two,
hell is the better option.

01:29:20.845 --> 01:29:23.282
But you've got
to break the curse.

01:29:23.316 --> 01:29:26.485
Give this poor fool
the rune!

01:29:30.523 --> 01:29:33.459
Find the body
of the man you killed.

01:29:33.492 --> 01:29:36.362
Next to it, beg for forgiveness.

01:29:36.395 --> 01:29:39.231
That is your rune.

01:29:39.265 --> 01:29:40.966
And that is your only hope.

01:29:42.301 --> 01:29:45.070
You may want to try the morgue.

01:30:01.554 --> 01:30:02.988
What does this guy want?

01:30:04.889 --> 01:30:05.957
Just give me a minute.

01:30:05.991 --> 01:30:09.194
Phil? My anniversary? Tonight.

01:30:15.568 --> 01:30:18.870
- What're you doing? I'm trying...
- I gotta go talk to that dead body, man.

01:30:18.903 --> 01:30:23.409
I'm trying to die and go to hell before I...
I decompose to the point where I can't.

01:30:30.982 --> 01:30:33.352
This shit ain't medical man!
It's spiritual!

01:30:40.593 --> 01:30:42.295
I gotta go talk to him!

01:30:42.328 --> 01:30:44.029
I gotta...

01:31:05.083 --> 01:31:07.952
No! Stop! Stop it! Don't!

01:31:07.986 --> 01:31:10.955
Stop! Don't!

01:31:21.534 --> 01:31:23.469
That's one of my favorites.

01:31:23.502 --> 01:31:26.104
Whatever.

01:31:28.407 --> 01:31:30.376
We meet Mommy here?

01:31:30.409 --> 01:31:33.978
Yeah. We meet Mommy here.

01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:41.019
This place smells dead.

01:31:42.621 --> 01:31:44.222
Where is she?

01:31:44.256 --> 01:31:46.157
She'll be here.

01:31:48.159 --> 01:31:49.428
What's that?

01:31:49.462 --> 01:31:52.063
It's a camera.

01:31:52.097 --> 01:31:55.468
I want you to stay...
stay right there.

01:31:57.936 --> 01:32:00.071
This is weird.

01:32:03.074 --> 01:32:08.179
We gotta use this
to make it super safe.

01:32:09.648 --> 01:32:10.616
Here you go.

01:32:10.649 --> 01:32:13.218
There it is.
Nice.

01:32:13.252 --> 01:32:15.186
Okay?

01:32:16.054 --> 01:32:17.356
Hmm.

01:32:20.158 --> 01:32:22.227
I don't think you really
know my mom.

01:32:22.261 --> 01:32:24.996
What're you talking about?
She called me

01:32:25.029 --> 01:32:26.965
and told me to pick you up
at school,

01:32:26.998 --> 01:32:29.668
that I had to protect you
from the bad things.

01:32:29.702 --> 01:32:32.036
The bad things
are already here.

01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:34.340
- Real close.
- Uh-huh.

01:32:34.373 --> 01:32:37.543
Do you know why
I'm so heavy for my size?

01:32:37.576 --> 01:32:39.978
I think it's because
I'm not human.

01:32:40.011 --> 01:32:41.480
I think it's because
I'm something else.

01:32:41.514 --> 01:32:44.015
- What? Your crazy mama tell you that?
- No.

01:32:44.048 --> 01:32:47.319
I've always known that.

01:32:51.457 --> 01:32:52.591
The bad things are coming.

01:32:52.625 --> 01:32:54.693
Yes.

01:32:54.727 --> 01:32:56.695
Yes.

01:32:56.729 --> 01:32:59.197
That's why...

01:33:00.466 --> 01:33:02.000
I want you to...

01:33:03.502 --> 01:33:07.540
bend down and stay low.

01:33:07.573 --> 01:33:09.542
Yes.

01:33:09.575 --> 01:33:11.477
Like hide and seek?

01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:13.579
Yeah. Just like a game.

01:33:13.612 --> 01:33:15.414
We're going to have fun?

01:33:15.448 --> 01:33:17.182
Fun?

01:33:18.216 --> 01:33:21.085
We're gonna have so much fun.

01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:33.131
You can only kill them once.

01:33:48.814 --> 01:33:50.349
Do you recognize them?

01:33:50.382 --> 01:33:52.551
They remember you.

01:33:55.454 --> 01:33:58.357
They've been right here
where you buried them,

01:33:58.390 --> 01:34:01.393
waiting for all the fun
you promised them.

01:34:21.447 --> 01:34:23.616
Please! Stop!

01:34:23.649 --> 01:34:26.117
No.

01:34:26.150 --> 01:34:28.454
Don't you enjoy
hearing their pain?

01:34:28.487 --> 01:34:30.221
The screams they didn't
get to make

01:34:30.256 --> 01:34:33.492
when they discovered
who the real monster was?

01:34:40.432 --> 01:34:42.301
Oh.

01:35:20.806 --> 01:35:23.342
I'm sorry.

01:35:23.375 --> 01:35:25.611
Forgive me.

01:35:26.478 --> 01:35:27.813
Listen.

01:35:30.214 --> 01:35:33.686
Please. I can take you
to your mommy.

01:35:33.719 --> 01:35:34.887
You don't know my mommy.

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.288
But you will know me.

01:35:43.829 --> 01:35:46.732
William, thief of innocence,

01:35:46.765 --> 01:35:51.537
