WEBVTT

00:15.000 --> 00:16.200
- Lizzie...

00:16.200 --> 00:17.970
- Oh, I didn't...

00:17.970 --> 00:20.700
I didn't know who else to call.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.210
Why would someone
shoot him, Laura?

00:24.210 --> 00:26.970
- I don't know.

00:26.980 --> 00:29.210
- The surgeon said
he's gonna make it.

00:29.210 --> 00:32.380
Make it?
What does that mean?

00:32.380 --> 00:34.020
- Eric's strong, Lizzie.
He'll be fine.

00:34.020 --> 00:36.220
- What if he...
- We will deal with it then.

00:39.020 --> 00:41.820
- He was a good brother, Laura.

00:41.820 --> 00:44.760
- And he's gonna be
a good brother for a long time.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.060
- I'm sorry, but...

00:50.170 --> 00:52.770
- I could use a cup of coffee.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.810
Let's let him rest.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.050
Eric wasn't...
- no.

01:09.050 --> 01:12.150
He gave all that up after...

01:12.160 --> 01:15.060
He's working at gerringer's.
He's doing good, Laura.

01:15.060 --> 01:17.890
He really is.
- I was sure he was clean.

01:17.890 --> 01:19.890
We had dinner
a couple of weeks ago.

01:19.900 --> 01:23.100
- He told me.
Yeah, he liked that.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.900
I don't think
he ever got over you.

01:27.740 --> 01:29.040
- Benny...

01:30.810 --> 01:32.910
- Damn fishbein
wouldn't let me out of work.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.280
Thank you, Laura,
for being here for her.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.040
- Mm.

01:36.050 --> 01:38.080
- Your brother?
- We don't... we don't know.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.480
He was shot
at least three times.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.450
I'm sorry.
This is Laura Gibbs.

01:43.450 --> 01:45.790
- It's nagel now.
- We grew up together.

01:45.790 --> 01:48.260
- Benny Martinez.
- You work together?

01:48.260 --> 01:50.290
- Uh, boyfriend.
- Can you stay with her?

01:50.290 --> 01:52.730
- Yeah, I won't leave her sight.

01:53.460 --> 01:56.200
- You call me
as soon as he wakes up.

02:03.970 --> 02:05.510
- Just passing by.
Had to look.

02:05.510 --> 02:07.140
- State's attorney
investigator nagel.

02:07.140 --> 02:08.979
I know the victim.

02:08.979 --> 02:10.910
What do you got?
- Well, csu found shell casings,

02:10.910 --> 02:12.210
seven of them,

02:12.220 --> 02:14.820
all from a .45 caliber.

02:14.820 --> 02:17.150
This is Eric cates's vehicle.

02:18.990 --> 02:20.990
Serious stuff.

02:20.990 --> 02:23.290
- Sure gets the job done.

02:23.290 --> 02:25.790
Detective Ken banks.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.500
- Steve Kim, narcotics.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.160
- Why are you guys here?

02:29.170 --> 02:30.770
- Walk with me.

02:31.970 --> 02:33.900
Did I hear you say
you knew the victim?

02:33.900 --> 02:35.240
- Eric cates.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.770
His sister called me
from the hospital.

02:37.770 --> 02:39.070
- Tough.
- Yeah.

02:41.110 --> 02:42.810
- We found a key of heroin.

02:42.810 --> 02:44.850
It was on the floor
on the passenger side.

02:44.850 --> 02:46.850
That's his blood, I'm guessing.

02:46.850 --> 02:48.320
We figure the guy
was doing a deal,

02:48.320 --> 02:51.350
probably keeping this one
for himself.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.930
- Eric cates.
Uh, I don't remember him.

03:06.940 --> 03:08.240
- You never met.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.070
He was my confidential
informant.

03:10.070 --> 03:11.810
He was shot last night.

03:11.810 --> 03:14.040
- Dead?
- No, lucky.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.210
He helped us out with
an old friend of yours.

03:18.210 --> 03:20.010
- Jayson creary.

03:20.020 --> 03:22.320
- Eric gave us
the death kings' stash house.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.850
You wouldn't have
convicted Jayson without it.

03:24.850 --> 03:27.220
- You think Jayson put out
a hit from stateville?

03:27.220 --> 03:29.890
- Jayson's kid brother, Jerome.

03:29.890 --> 03:31.560
He runs the death kings now.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.090
He cleans their cash
through a fancy car dealership.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.560
I'm thinking
he somehow found out

03:35.570 --> 03:37.160
that Eric was my ci.

03:37.170 --> 03:38.900
- But you're not sure?

03:40.540 --> 03:42.200
- Eric is a good guy, Peter.

03:42.210 --> 03:44.540
He's been out of the life
since you nailed creary.

03:44.540 --> 03:47.910
I wanna work it.
- This is cpd's case.

03:49.510 --> 03:52.180
- Guys like Eric cates,
they risk their lives for us.

03:52.180 --> 03:54.110
- And in return,
they get to stay out of prison.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.850
- So that means
we turn our backs on them?

03:58.250 --> 04:00.860
Fine.
Find out what you can,

04:00.860 --> 04:02.960
but stay out of the cops' way.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.030
Well, look who decided
to show up for work.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.340
You look like crap.
- We got an attempted murder.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.269
A key of heroin on the floor.

04:17.269 --> 04:19.269
- What's that gotta do with us?

04:19.279 --> 04:22.140
- Stone said we could work it.
- Could?

04:22.140 --> 04:25.080
- He was also my ci
before you got here.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.050
- You know you're not supposed...
- You coming?

04:27.050 --> 04:28.920
- Where to?

04:28.920 --> 04:31.190
- We're gonna talk to
Jerome creary.

04:32.990 --> 04:35.220
- Least you can do is pretend
you're looking to buy.

04:35.220 --> 04:38.030
I don't want you scaring off
the real customers.

04:38.030 --> 04:40.090
- Yeah, these things
are flying off the shelf.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.300
- You'd be surprised.
Peoples got a need for speed,

04:42.300 --> 04:43.960
and to look hot when they do it.

04:43.970 --> 04:45.900
- We're here about
your other business.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.230
- Don't do that no more,

04:47.240 --> 04:49.040
since you sent big bro
to stateville.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.970
- We can look through
your books, Jerome,

04:50.970 --> 04:53.340
see how much cash you got
running through this place,

04:53.340 --> 04:55.410
or you can answer
a few simple questions.

04:55.410 --> 04:57.180
- What questions?
- Eric cates.

04:57.180 --> 04:59.250
- What about him?
- He used to work for you

04:59.250 --> 05:01.180
in the business
we can't mention,

05:01.180 --> 05:03.080
selling the stuff you'd prefer
we didn't talk about.

05:03.090 --> 05:05.190
- Yeah, I haven't
seen him since.

05:05.190 --> 05:08.120
- Since you shot him
and took his stash last night?

05:08.120 --> 05:11.030
- Hey, I ain't seen him
a couple of years at least.

05:12.330 --> 05:13.630
So where do you keep
these books?

05:13.630 --> 05:15.200
- Okay, okay.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.660
He worked for my bro, dude.

05:16.670 --> 05:18.230
I got nothing to do
with his ass.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.070
If it was a hijack,

05:20.070 --> 05:22.140
I'd be looking at
Ricky marscak's crew.

05:22.140 --> 05:24.040
They like taking
what ain't theirs.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.440
Your boys in narcotics got him.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.650
- Civilian walks in.

05:34.650 --> 05:36.380
How often do you see
an actual good samaritan?

05:36.390 --> 05:38.450
Tells us he's seen the shooting.

05:38.450 --> 05:40.120
- He ID'd marscak?

05:40.120 --> 05:42.220
- No, but he saw
a hopped-up red Chevy.

05:42.220 --> 05:43.960
We put two and two together,

05:43.960 --> 05:45.990
hopped-up red Chevy
and a drug heist,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.960
and our compass points
right to Ricky marscak.

05:48.970 --> 05:51.100
Thinks he's some kind of
Robin of the hood.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.030
Steals from rich dealers,

05:53.040 --> 05:54.370
sells to poor junkies.

05:54.370 --> 05:57.170
There you go.
Minute, Stevie?

06:01.110 --> 06:03.380
- I got nothing.
Says he was banging some babe

06:03.380 --> 06:05.050
whose name he forgot
till 3:00 A.M.

06:05.050 --> 06:08.150
- Mind if I talk to him?
- Help yourself.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.120
- Maybe I can take a look at
that witness statement.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.720
- Yeah, right this way.

06:12.420 --> 06:15.760
- I'ma tell you the same thing
I told your friend.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.990
Eat me.
- Sorry, I'm on duty.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.130
I'm sure detective Kim
informed you

06:21.130 --> 06:23.000
that there is a witness
who saw you.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.130
- He saw a car
that looked like mine.

06:25.130 --> 06:27.070
Lot of chevys in Chicago.

06:27.070 --> 06:29.500
- Driven by guys
who are known for hijacking h?

06:29.510 --> 06:31.740
- You see, that's the problem.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.410
People believe what they hear.

06:33.410 --> 06:36.010
Facebook, Twitter,

06:36.010 --> 06:38.280
anybody can say any damn thing.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.020
- They can say that
Eric cates is still alive.

06:41.020 --> 06:44.280
- It's good if he is,
'cause I didn't shot the s.O.B.

06:44.290 --> 06:46.090
Ask him.
He'll tell ya.

06:53.060 --> 06:55.060
- Three bullets.

06:55.060 --> 06:57.500
What the hell do you have to
live for that's so important?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.330
- I wanna see
the cubbies repeat.

06:59.340 --> 07:02.540
- Oh,
that's a good reason as any.

07:02.540 --> 07:05.040
- Did you ever tell your partner
what happened at prom?

07:05.040 --> 07:07.270
- Mm, he embarrasses too easy.

07:09.740 --> 07:13.110
Eric...
The heroin in your car...

07:13.120 --> 07:15.380
- It wasn't mine.

07:15.380 --> 07:18.190
I already told the cops.

07:18.190 --> 07:20.150
And I didn't see marscak.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.120
I couldn't see diddly.
The lights were in my eyes.

07:23.130 --> 07:25.230
- Tell us what you remember.

07:25.230 --> 07:27.460
- I was going home.
- From where?

07:27.460 --> 07:29.360
- I had a couple beers
at mcgavins.

07:29.370 --> 07:30.500
- Then what?

07:30.500 --> 07:34.440
- Um, I'm driving down west Lex.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.270
It's one way, right?

07:37.270 --> 07:38.810
A car comes towards me.

07:38.810 --> 07:41.080
- A Chevy?
- Could be.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.440
Brights were on.

07:43.450 --> 07:45.380
Two guys get out.

07:45.380 --> 07:48.180
I couldn't see their faces.

07:48.180 --> 07:50.480
- They say anything?
- I didn't wait around.

07:50.490 --> 07:53.850
I started backing up.

07:53.860 --> 07:55.760
That's all I know.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.360
- Witness says he saw
a hopped-up red Chevy.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.230
That's what marscak drives.
- Red?

08:01.230 --> 08:04.160
I couldn't see a lot, but
if the car was red, I'd know.

08:14.540 --> 08:17.240
- An eyewitness?
We don't get that too often.

08:17.250 --> 08:20.110
- There may be a discrepancy
in Jerry Burrows' statement.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.780
He specifically said that
marscak was driving a red Chevy,

08:23.790 --> 08:26.150
only Eric cates never saw red.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.120
He also saw two shooters.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.590
Burrows said there was only one.

08:29.590 --> 08:31.560
- This Burrows guy,
he was a good citizen.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.260
Not even a parking ticket.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.299
- Then he just became
a better witness.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.600
I've got 24 hours to put marscak
in front of a judge.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.600
- The crime scene's
a good place to start.

08:48.210 --> 08:50.540
That's where cates was shot.

08:50.550 --> 08:52.810
- Jerry Burrows said
he left the strip club

08:52.820 --> 08:54.620
and was walking home
when he heard the shots.

08:54.620 --> 08:56.550
- Where does he live?
- Leland street.

08:56.550 --> 08:59.220
It's a few blocks north of here.
- So if it were me,

08:59.220 --> 09:02.190
to get from the strip club
to Leland at night?

09:02.190 --> 09:04.530
I'd walk up Broadway.
It's got a lot more light.

09:04.530 --> 09:06.190
- Maybe he just wanted
a beef sandwich

09:06.200 --> 09:07.560
or a slice of pizza.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.630
- Even more reason
to walk up Broadway.

09:10.930 --> 09:13.630
We're in the neighborhood.
Why don't we talk to Burrows?

09:13.640 --> 09:15.440
- Sure.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.480
- Damn, I thought
we were done with this.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.610
- Done with what?
- You're cops, right?

09:25.610 --> 09:27.450
- We're with
the state's attorney's office.

09:27.450 --> 09:30.620
- You're Jerry Burrows?
- Bobby Burrows.

09:30.620 --> 09:32.450
Dad ain't here.
He's working.

09:32.450 --> 09:34.190
- Where?

09:34.190 --> 09:35.690
- All over.
He's a cabbie.

09:35.690 --> 09:38.230
Look, I'm busy.
- Doing what?

09:38.230 --> 09:41.500
- Uh, calling my lawyer.

09:44.530 --> 09:46.630
If you saw a shooting, and
you wanted to be a good citizen,

09:46.640 --> 09:49.900
you'd go to
the closest district, right?

09:49.910 --> 09:51.670
19's just a few blocks away.

09:51.670 --> 09:56.340
Instead, Burrows walks
a mile and a half to narcotics

09:56.350 --> 09:58.350
to make a statement
to banks and Kim.

09:58.350 --> 10:00.450
- You want my opinion?

10:00.450 --> 10:02.620
- No.

10:02.620 --> 10:03.620
- I don't think you're
approaching this

10:03.620 --> 10:05.490
with clear eyes.

10:05.490 --> 10:08.220
- Forget about it.
- Hey, look, I'm just saying.

10:08.220 --> 10:10.360
Everybody looks bad to you,
except for the guy shot

10:10.360 --> 10:12.390
with a key of h in his car.

10:12.390 --> 10:14.630
- Eric and I grew up
together, okay?

10:14.630 --> 10:17.660
When dad had too much,
his mom took me in.

10:22.670 --> 10:25.310
- Jerry Burrows may be clean,
but his kid, Bobby,

10:25.310 --> 10:27.940
was picked up twice
for possession with intent.

10:27.940 --> 10:29.540
Probation both times.

10:29.550 --> 10:31.380
Whoa.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.650
Six months ago, he was arrested
for statutory rape.

10:33.650 --> 10:35.920
He had sex with
a 15-year-old girl.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.350
- Why isn't he making
license plates somewhere?

10:38.350 --> 10:39.690
- Same day the sex charges
were dropped,

10:39.690 --> 10:41.420
cocaine charges were filed.

10:41.420 --> 10:46.390
Arresting officers in
the drug case...

10:46.400 --> 10:48.300
Detectives banks and Kim.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.430
- Vice sent Bobby Burrows to us.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.040
He was a harmless junkie.
- Who raped a minor.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.570
- Old saying:
No victim, no crime.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.370
Girl's parents
didn't want the neighbors

11:00.380 --> 11:02.280
to think ill of them.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.310
- Why didn't
the drug charge stick?

11:04.310 --> 11:05.680
- What would be the point?

11:05.680 --> 11:07.550
- Bobby Burrows
was a minor leaguer.

11:07.550 --> 11:09.750
We felt he'd be more help to us
out on the street.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.790
You were narcotics.
You know the drill.

11:11.790 --> 11:14.590
Let the little fish go
to get the big fish, yeah?

11:14.590 --> 11:16.020
- Bobby Burrows was your ci?

11:16.030 --> 11:18.530
- He was after we let him scoot.

11:18.530 --> 11:20.430
- See, this is where it
all gets confusing.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.560
Um, you gotta admit,
it's a hell of a coincidence

11:22.560 --> 11:24.600
that your ci's father
is also a witness

11:24.600 --> 11:26.500
in a shooting that
you're investigating.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.600
- If you're accusing us
of something, spit it out.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.410
- Cool it, Stevie,
they're just doing their jobs.

11:31.410 --> 11:33.610
We did good by Jerry's kid.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.780
He trusted us.
- And you believe him?

11:35.780 --> 11:37.610
- Of course he does.
He gets Ricky marscak,

11:37.610 --> 11:39.580
another medal for
his collection.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.620
- Hey, you're implying Burrows
is lying to make our case.

11:41.620 --> 11:43.450
- You did do his kid a solid.

11:43.450 --> 11:45.350
- Hey, we're good.

11:45.350 --> 11:47.690
Thanks.
Sorry to bother you.

11:50.530 --> 11:53.760
- You believed that crap?
- Not for a second.

12:00.700 --> 12:03.740
- Got a minute, Mr. Burrows?
- Aw, jeez.

12:03.740 --> 12:06.110
Bobby told me
you were bothering him.

12:06.110 --> 12:08.440
- Just wanna follow up on
that shooting you witnessed.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.340
- Look, I told the other guys
what I saw.

12:10.350 --> 12:12.480
- An orange olds?
- It was a Chevy.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.680
- And you said it was red.
- Look, Mr. Burrows,

12:15.680 --> 12:17.620
we know about the problem
you have with your son.

12:17.620 --> 12:19.120
- Look, it was a mistake
with that girl.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.750
Bobby didn't know she was 15.

12:20.760 --> 12:23.090
- We also know
detectives banks and Kim

12:23.090 --> 12:25.130
helped Bobby out of that jam.

12:25.130 --> 12:27.430
Now the truth is
you don't owe them anything.

12:27.430 --> 12:29.500
- You don't have a kid, do you?
- Two, actually.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.470
- If banks and Kim pushed you

12:31.470 --> 12:33.670
to say that you saw a red Chevy
you didn't really see,

12:33.670 --> 12:36.040
an innocent man
could do a lot of time.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.840
- I saw it, okay?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.140
Look, i... i don't know
what the hell you want from me.

12:40.140 --> 12:41.840
I gotta go.

12:48.550 --> 12:51.450
- You want me to say the car
was red, the car was red.

12:51.450 --> 12:53.790
- You know I don't work
like that.

12:53.790 --> 12:55.920
Look, I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

12:55.920 --> 12:59.660
Somebody's gotta catch
the bad guys, right?

12:59.660 --> 13:02.600
- I was talking about
something else.

13:04.030 --> 13:06.730
Do you remember
those storage units

13:06.740 --> 13:08.500
back in ravenswood?

13:08.500 --> 13:10.670
- We used to jump from
one rooftop to the other.

13:10.670 --> 13:12.610
- You would jump.
I would watch.

13:12.610 --> 13:13.940
Except for that one time.

13:13.940 --> 13:15.580
- One more inch,
and you would've made it.

13:15.580 --> 13:17.880
You saved my butt.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.450
- I don't think
I ever thanked you.

13:20.450 --> 13:21.620
- We were seven.

13:25.550 --> 13:28.790
- I'm sorry for
getting you into all this.

13:28.790 --> 13:31.930
- You didn't get me
into anything, Laura.

13:31.930 --> 13:33.560
Hell, you kept me out of jail.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.800
- And I put a target
on your back.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.500
- What, you think
that this was payback

13:38.500 --> 13:39.870
for creary's brother?

13:43.470 --> 13:45.840
- You know...

13:45.840 --> 13:48.610
You can tell me anything, Eric.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.710
It won't leave this room.
- The heroin wasn't mine.

13:51.710 --> 13:54.610
I don't know
how it got into my car.

13:57.590 --> 13:59.090
Either you believe me,
or you don't.

13:59.090 --> 14:01.050
- Hey, what kind of
person would I be

14:01.060 --> 14:02.890
if I didn't believe
the guy who saved me

14:02.890 --> 14:05.590
from falling off a roof?

14:08.530 --> 14:10.560
Do you ever wonder
how things might've turned out

14:10.570 --> 14:12.770
if you didn't go away
to college?

14:22.840 --> 14:24.810
- Sorry.

14:24.810 --> 14:27.510
- Your partner's been busy.
- Yeah?

14:27.520 --> 14:28.920
- Okay, what do we know?

14:28.920 --> 14:31.620
We know there was heroin
in Eric cates's car.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.550
- He swears wasn't his.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.120
- Yeah, listen and learn,
the lab says it was 10% pure.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.090
- That's next to worthless.

14:38.090 --> 14:40.730
- Exactly, which got me curious,
so I went through case files

14:40.730 --> 14:42.500
and found three other incidents

14:42.500 --> 14:44.530
of cut heroin
being picked up as evidence,

14:44.530 --> 14:45.900
all involving murders.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.000
Now first,
you have Pedro Garcia.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.670
He was found in his bedroom
with three bullets in his chest,

14:50.670 --> 14:52.910
two keys of cheap heroin
under his bed.

14:52.910 --> 14:55.980
Dead, no arrest.

14:55.980 --> 14:57.680
Miguel Ortega.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.080
He was found
behind a bowling alley,

14:59.080 --> 15:00.810
bullet in his head.
- An assassination?

15:00.820 --> 15:04.850
- One key in his backpack,
no arrest.

15:04.850 --> 15:07.050
Luis vargas.
He was shot in his Taurus.

15:07.060 --> 15:08.860
Bullet through an eye,

15:08.860 --> 15:10.520
and just to be sure,
one through his heart.

15:10.530 --> 15:14.090
Two keys in his trunk,
dead, no arrest.

15:14.100 --> 15:18.000
Now all three were killed
within the last 24 months.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.700
What else did they have
in common?

15:19.700 --> 15:21.870
- Mm, same gang?
- Bingo.

15:21.870 --> 15:23.540
23rd street jokers.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.670
The jokers have been
in a turf war

15:25.670 --> 15:27.870
with the death kings
for quite some time.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.110
- The death kings.
That's Jayson creary's gang.

15:30.110 --> 15:32.680
- Which is now run by
his little brother, Jerome.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.050
- When he's not selling
lamborghinis.

15:35.050 --> 15:37.180
- So you're saying

15:37.190 --> 15:39.620
all four were shot by creary?

15:39.620 --> 15:41.690
- Or on his orders.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.190
But here's the thing,

15:43.190 --> 15:44.820
all four shootings were

15:44.830 --> 15:46.190
or are currently
being investigated

15:46.190 --> 15:48.630
by the same narcotics officers.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.030
- Banks and Kim.

15:52.200 --> 15:56.070
- Stephen Kim was the lead
detective in all of them.

15:56.070 --> 15:59.110
- Banks and Kim are covering up
murders for the death kings?

15:59.110 --> 16:00.740
- Or they were doing
the killings themselves.

16:00.740 --> 16:03.980
- Hey, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.980
For now, let's focus on
the cates shooting.

16:05.980 --> 16:07.710
We need to prove that
Jerome creary

16:07.720 --> 16:10.050
knew that Eric cates
informed on his brother.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.220
- Do you think that I'm stupid?

16:14.220 --> 16:16.760
Why would I tell anybody
that I snitched?

16:16.760 --> 16:18.660
It had to be somebody
on your end.

16:18.660 --> 16:21.190
- I checked the pd database.
Nobody accessed your file.

16:23.970 --> 16:27.100
- Maybe you mentioned it
to someone in passing.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.140
Lizzie, maybe.
- You know the last thing I'd do

16:29.140 --> 16:32.140
is get my kid sister
involved in my crap.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.150
- Can we get someone
to guard him?

16:39.150 --> 16:40.880
Our people?

16:40.880 --> 16:43.050
- I'll stay with him
till they show.

16:46.690 --> 16:48.820
- I want you to think
very hard, Lizzie.

16:48.820 --> 16:51.890
Did you ever tell anyone that
I work at the state's attorney?

16:51.890 --> 16:55.160
- Why would I do that?
- Just think.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.760
- I don't know, like who?

16:57.770 --> 16:59.630
- A boyfriend?

16:59.640 --> 17:01.700
- Benny?

17:01.700 --> 17:03.170
- He knew me, Lizzie.

17:03.170 --> 17:05.210
When he showed up at the
hospital, he called me Laura.

17:05.210 --> 17:07.270
- Oh, my god.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.040
Was Eric shot because of me?

17:09.040 --> 17:11.810
- What did you tell him?
- I don't know.

17:11.810 --> 17:15.180
We talked about when...
When we were kids,

17:15.180 --> 17:19.020
how it was funny that you used
to talk Eric into cutting school

17:19.020 --> 17:20.790
to smoke pot in the park,

17:20.790 --> 17:22.790
but now you work for
the state's attorney.

17:22.790 --> 17:26.290
But I don't think
I used your name.

17:26.290 --> 17:29.060
Did Benny...
- I don't know.

17:29.060 --> 17:31.200
- Oh, my god.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.130
- She talks about you a lot.

17:33.140 --> 17:34.800
You know, she and Eric
are really proud.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.300
They... they...
- can we cut the crap?

17:37.970 --> 17:40.010
Is there a problem?

17:40.010 --> 17:43.180
- Did you ever hear of
conspiracy to commit murder?

17:43.180 --> 17:46.150
If you happen to tell someone
about my relationship with Eric,

17:46.150 --> 17:48.820
and that person tries to
kill him because of it...

17:48.820 --> 17:50.980
- I didn't know that
he would do anything.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.960
- Jerome creary?

17:58.260 --> 18:00.690
- I owed him 10 grand.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.260
And I may have mentioned
that I had a buddy of mine

18:02.260 --> 18:04.230
who had a good thing going at
the state's attorney's office,

18:04.230 --> 18:06.130
and if he let me slide
for a couple of months,

18:06.130 --> 18:08.970
maybe I could hook him up
with a favor when he needed it.

18:16.010 --> 18:18.880
- I want you to think
really hard now, Benny.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.980
Did you mention my name?

18:20.980 --> 18:23.120
- No, why would I do that?

18:23.120 --> 18:26.020
- It doesn't matter
if Eric died or not.

18:26.020 --> 18:28.760
It was conspiracy to murder
the moment you agreed...

18:28.760 --> 18:30.720
- no, I didn't agree
to anything, okay?

18:30.730 --> 18:33.990
I didn't know, I swear.
- Did you tell creary my name?

18:50.280 --> 18:52.080
- Check it out.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.850
Back to buy this time?

18:55.850 --> 18:57.350
- Just have one question first.
- Yeah?

18:57.350 --> 18:59.050
- You have a lawyer?

18:59.050 --> 19:00.990
- Jerome creary,
you're under arrest

19:00.990 --> 19:02.760
for the attempted murder
or Eric cates.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.790
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:04.790 --> 19:07.060
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

19:07.060 --> 19:08.330
in a court of law.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.800
- And why would he confess
to anything?

19:14.800 --> 19:15.840
- Because he has a lot to lose
if he doesn't.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.300
Like what?

19:17.310 --> 19:18.840
- Like the next 20 years
of your life.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.170
- You're forgetting
Pedro Garcia,

19:20.180 --> 19:22.240
Miguel Ortega, and Luis vargas.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.440
You gave the order.
They all ended up dead.

19:24.450 --> 19:26.510
- Did I say 20?

19:26.520 --> 19:28.410
Your great-great-grandchildren
will be visiting you in prison.

19:28.420 --> 19:31.080
- Okay.
So far, I haven't heard anything

19:31.090 --> 19:32.850
that resembles evidence.

19:32.850 --> 19:35.460
- We've got the guys who pulled
the triggers on his orders.

19:35.460 --> 19:37.220
- Oh, really.
And you believe them?

19:37.230 --> 19:39.330
- Why wouldn't we?
They're cops.

19:39.330 --> 19:40.790
- They turned on me?
- Shut up, Jerome.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.330
It's still dubious evidence.

19:42.330 --> 19:44.300
- But your client's
cut heroin isn't.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.800
It was left at every scene.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.400
- I want a deal.
- They can't cut a deal.

19:52.310 --> 19:54.440
- You're the one
who put Jason away.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.810
- As you know, Jerome,
I can cut you a deal.

19:56.810 --> 19:58.410
One murder,
1/3 of your sentence.

19:58.410 --> 20:00.450
That's as low as I go.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.920
- It's your word
against a couple cops.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.350
- Killer cops.

20:03.350 --> 20:04.380
They're screwing
with you, Jerome.

20:04.390 --> 20:05.890
They need you.

20:05.890 --> 20:07.350
- One of them's got
how many medals?

20:07.360 --> 20:08.820
- Thirteen.
- Yeah.

20:08.820 --> 20:10.820
- Your choice, Jerome.

20:10.830 --> 20:13.230
- Look, they wouldn't be coming
to you with a deal unless they...

20:13.230 --> 20:16.160
- you get to go home
and bang that skinny ass wife.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.230
None of this make
no difference to you.

20:20.230 --> 20:21.840
We got a deal.

20:27.410 --> 20:29.480
- The big dog.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.580
- Dawson, right?

20:31.580 --> 20:33.580
Grab a seat.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.550
Butchie, get investigator Dawson
a beer, will ya?

20:39.890 --> 20:41.920
What brings you here?

20:41.920 --> 20:43.520
- Memories.

20:43.530 --> 20:46.860
- Push to shove,
that's all we got.

20:46.860 --> 20:49.460
- Hm.

20:49.460 --> 20:51.870
I sat right at that booth

20:51.870 --> 20:53.470
with Lyle, bosco, and Kelly.

20:53.470 --> 20:55.170
You had just
brought down cutler.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.470
- And with him,
4 million bucks of cocaine.

20:57.470 --> 20:59.210
- You were putting down
shots of Jameson

20:59.210 --> 21:02.280
faster than I could count.

21:02.280 --> 21:05.410
I said to myself, "man,
that's the cop I wanna be."

21:05.410 --> 21:07.950
- Nothing to be ashamed of, kid.

21:07.950 --> 21:10.550
I looked up to an old copper
the same way.

21:10.550 --> 21:12.350
Gerhardt.
You ever hear of him?

21:12.350 --> 21:13.890
- Yeah.

21:13.890 --> 21:16.490
- Well, let me tell you
a story or three.

21:18.190 --> 21:20.890
- Jesus, what?
I'm eating pizza with my family.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.430
- Who is it, Stephen?

21:22.430 --> 21:23.900
- I don't wanna
hurt your family, Kim.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.430
- Good, get lost then.

21:26.430 --> 21:28.300
- I can't do that.

21:35.540 --> 21:38.180
- It's work, babe.

21:38.180 --> 21:39.580
Don't wait up.

21:41.580 --> 21:43.650
- Put your hands
behind your back.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.460
Okay, let's go.

21:55.460 --> 21:57.260
- Excuse me.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.270
Got it.

22:03.700 --> 22:07.340
Okay.
What you're gonna do is

22:07.340 --> 22:10.240
you're gonna stand up,
and we're gonna walk out of here

22:10.250 --> 22:13.650
like we're high school buddies
on our way to a whore house.

22:13.650 --> 22:15.480
- Or what?
- Or I'm gonna cuff you

22:15.480 --> 22:17.550
right here in front of
your fan club.

22:46.580 --> 22:50.450
- Docket number 16cr2876.

22:50.450 --> 22:53.620
People of the state of Illinois
versus Kenneth j. Banks

22:53.620 --> 22:55.690
and Stephen t. Kim.

22:55.690 --> 22:57.460
Charges are first-degree murder,
three counts,

22:57.460 --> 22:59.660
attempted murder, one count.

22:59.660 --> 23:02.560
- You boys have been busy.
What are the people looking for?

23:02.560 --> 23:04.630
- The people request no bail.

23:04.630 --> 23:07.570
- In addition to working for
the cpd for the past 11 years,

23:07.570 --> 23:09.670
my client is a family man

23:09.670 --> 23:11.440
and a solid member
of his community.

23:11.440 --> 23:14.110
Defense asks that
he be released on an I bond.

23:14.110 --> 23:18.110
- Your honor, my client is the
third most decorated detective

23:18.110 --> 23:20.510
in the history of
the Chicago police department.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.750
If that doesn't get him
an I bond, what will?

23:22.750 --> 23:24.680
- Their résumés notwithstanding,

23:24.690 --> 23:27.720
they're each charged with four
violent felonies, your honor.

23:27.720 --> 23:30.460
They were paid assassins.

23:30.460 --> 23:33.560
- D-bond set at $250,000 each.

23:37.430 --> 23:39.700
- I had hoped we could do this
one on one,

23:39.700 --> 23:42.400
considering the possible
divergent interests.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.370
- You can step out
if you like, Mr. fetzer.

23:45.770 --> 23:47.440
- So picture this,

23:47.440 --> 23:50.310
two detectives,
both solid citizens,

23:50.310 --> 23:52.580
heroes even, working afterhours.

23:52.580 --> 23:55.480
They spot a car careening wildly
up a one-way street,

23:55.480 --> 23:57.050
so they circle the block

23:57.050 --> 23:58.720
in an attempt to head him off
at the pass.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.090
- This is all hypothetical.
- Oh, purely.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.690
So our heroes head towards
the culprit's car.

24:05.690 --> 24:07.590
Thank god, he stops.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.660
They get out of their vehicle.
They offer assistance.

24:10.670 --> 24:12.430
They identify themselves.

24:12.430 --> 24:14.430
But the son of a bitch
stomps on the gas,

24:14.440 --> 24:16.170
hurdling straight towards them.

24:16.170 --> 24:18.070
They shoot in order to
preserve their lives.

24:18.070 --> 24:20.340
- They drove off,
leaving cates for dead.

24:20.340 --> 24:21.810
- They're human.
They panicked.

24:21.810 --> 24:24.510
- For that single act of
simple malfeasance,

24:24.510 --> 24:26.580
they'll plead to
leaving the scene.

24:26.580 --> 24:29.150
- Jerome creary will testify
that he hired them.

24:29.150 --> 24:30.620
- This would be
the infamous gangster

24:30.620 --> 24:32.550
who's trying to save
his own ass.

24:32.550 --> 24:35.150
- Forty years.
They do it all.

24:36.090 --> 24:37.690
- We'll see you in court.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.630
- Talk with forensics.

24:43.630 --> 24:47.770
See how much of O'Boyle's
hypothesis we can disprove.

24:49.800 --> 24:54.210
- Seven bullets entered the car
from two weapons.

24:54.210 --> 24:55.880
- Can you tell if the car
was moving towards or away

24:55.880 --> 24:59.180
from the shooters?
- Sorry, we're not that good.

24:59.180 --> 25:00.680
I know what you're thinking,

25:00.680 --> 25:02.750
but he might have
already been shot

25:02.750 --> 25:05.150
when he put the car in reverse.

25:05.150 --> 25:06.720
There was gunshot residue

25:06.720 --> 25:08.390
in the front seat of
the detective's car,

25:08.390 --> 25:09.720
if that helps.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.590
It probably rubbed off
their hands.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.730
Here and here.

25:16.730 --> 25:19.130
- This is banks and Kim's car?
- They're the defendants.

25:19.130 --> 25:21.130
Weird, huh?

25:22.840 --> 25:25.840
- Since when do detective cars
have dash cams?

25:25.840 --> 25:28.810
- They're not supposed to.
Leave it to the bureaucrats.

25:28.810 --> 25:30.740
That puppy has
never been turned on.

25:30.750 --> 25:32.550
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

25:32.550 --> 25:35.210
Shame too, because
the system's activated

25:35.220 --> 25:37.150
when the siren's turned on.

25:37.150 --> 25:40.220
It starts recording
a minute before the sirens hit.

25:41.260 --> 25:42.720
- How does that work?

25:42.720 --> 25:45.260
- Got me.
I was never a tech guy.

25:45.260 --> 25:47.630
<i>- You sure that's cates?
- That's him.</i>

25:47.630 --> 25:50.430
<i>Let's do this
so we can get some sleep.</i>

25:55.670 --> 25:57.200
- I can't believe
they were that stupid.

25:57.210 --> 25:58.600
- They didn't know.

25:58.610 --> 26:01.170
The recorder turns on
automatically

26:01.180 --> 26:02.880
when the siren is hit.

26:02.880 --> 26:05.880
- I didn't hear a siren.
- Because they didn't use one.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.550
- I'm lost.

26:07.550 --> 26:09.250
- Virgil in forensics told me

26:09.250 --> 26:11.650
that not only does the siren
activate the device,

26:11.650 --> 26:12.950
but it starts recording

26:12.950 --> 26:15.720
a minute before
the siren is turned on.

26:15.720 --> 26:16.860
- I can't believe
I'm saying this,

26:16.860 --> 26:18.820
but how does it know?

26:18.830 --> 26:21.460
- Been there, believe me,
but then I thought about it.

26:21.460 --> 26:23.230
The only way it could
start recording

26:23.230 --> 26:26.500
before the siren is turned on
is if it was always recording,

26:26.500 --> 26:29.570
in a continuous loop,
erasing older stuff as it goes.

26:29.570 --> 26:31.500
All anyone's usually
interested in

26:31.510 --> 26:33.310
is the minute before
the siren goes off,

26:33.310 --> 26:35.610
but it's all there,
waiting for a savvy tech guy

26:35.610 --> 26:37.740
to dig it out of the hard drive.

26:37.750 --> 26:39.980
- I'm very impressed, Anna.

26:39.980 --> 26:42.280
Make copies, and send them
to defense counsel.

26:49.920 --> 26:53.260
<i>- Are you sure that's cates?
- That's him.</i>

26:53.260 --> 26:54.860
<i>Let's do this
so we can get some sleep.</i>

27:00.830 --> 27:02.840
- Well, I'm not one to offer
gratuitous advice,

27:02.840 --> 27:04.900
but someone should
start talking deal.

27:04.910 --> 27:06.670
- Well, we would, your honor,

27:06.670 --> 27:08.770
if it weren't for
that pesky fourth amendment.

27:08.780 --> 27:10.510
Under katz v. U.S.,

27:10.510 --> 27:12.850
an unauthorized
electronic eavesdropping

27:12.850 --> 27:15.750
is deemed to be
an illegal search and seizure.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.880
- You're arguing that the cops
needed a search warrant

27:17.890 --> 27:19.690
to bug their own car?
- Why not?

27:19.690 --> 27:20.990
The issue is not whether or not

27:20.990 --> 27:23.260
the car is
constitutionally protected.

27:23.260 --> 27:25.260
As we all know,
the fourth amendment

27:25.260 --> 27:27.290
protects people, not places.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.660
- And the people in question
were cpd officers.

27:29.660 --> 27:32.030
- So your honor,
Mr. stone is arguing

27:32.030 --> 27:33.730
that on the night
that the defendants

27:33.740 --> 27:35.670
allegedly shot Mr. cates,

27:35.670 --> 27:38.600
they were not acting as
law enforcement officers,

27:38.610 --> 27:40.670
but rather as common criminals,

27:40.680 --> 27:43.340
so why shouldn't
they be afforded

27:43.340 --> 27:44.940
the same protections and rights

27:44.950 --> 27:47.580
as the common pimp, cat burglar,
or stock swindler?

27:47.580 --> 27:49.620
- Because when they shot
Mr. cates,

27:49.620 --> 27:52.620
they were acting under
color of law.

27:52.620 --> 27:54.350
- Good try, Mr. O'Boyle,

27:54.360 --> 27:56.020
but the recordings
are admissible.

28:02.930 --> 28:04.900
- I was surprised to get
your phone call, Mr. fetzer.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.900
You were very quiet
in the chambers this morning.

28:06.900 --> 28:09.900
- I know a losing battle
when I see one.

28:09.900 --> 28:12.370
My client wants to put
an end to this.

28:14.980 --> 28:17.910
- Uh, a few years back,

28:17.910 --> 28:19.580
banks said
there's money to be made,

28:19.580 --> 28:21.850
and no real people
would get hurt.

28:21.850 --> 28:23.850
- Real people?

28:23.850 --> 28:26.950
- You know, at first, all creary
wanted was information.

28:26.950 --> 28:28.750
Is anyone gonna raid
one of his joints?

28:28.760 --> 28:30.390
Anybody from his crew
tipping off the cops?

28:30.390 --> 28:32.020
Stuff like that.
- And you never thought about

28:32.030 --> 28:34.390
what creary was gonna do
with that information?

28:34.400 --> 28:35.800
- What's to think about?

28:35.800 --> 28:37.400
I mean, these people
don't have any...

28:38.730 --> 28:42.000
Later, we'd carry drug money,
sometimes guns.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.940
I mean, who's gonna
rob us, right?

28:43.940 --> 28:45.840
- And the killing?

28:45.840 --> 28:47.740
- Just happened.

28:47.740 --> 28:49.610
I mean, these guys are
killing each other

28:49.610 --> 28:50.780
on a daily basis.
What difference does it make?

28:50.780 --> 28:53.410
- Okay.
I can't help you.

28:54.980 --> 28:57.480
- I'll go to jail
for as long as you want.

28:59.950 --> 29:02.390
- And what do you want from me?

29:02.390 --> 29:04.460
- My family, all right?

29:04.460 --> 29:07.360
I want them relocated,
some place they'll be safe.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.500
- He'll testify to
anything you want.

29:18.770 --> 29:19.970
Life.

29:25.110 --> 29:26.710
- Whatever.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.650
- Who were the victims?

29:35.660 --> 29:36.890
- They were the members
of the jokers.

29:36.890 --> 29:39.060
- That's a gang?
- Mexicans, yeah.

29:39.060 --> 29:40.930
They were moving product
on our turf.

29:40.930 --> 29:42.760
I needed to teach them a lesson.

29:42.760 --> 29:44.430
That's why I squashed Garcia,

29:44.430 --> 29:46.070
then Ortega, then vargas.

29:46.070 --> 29:48.130
- You mean you killed them?

29:48.140 --> 29:50.040
- Me? Nah.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.810
I paid for that.
- Who did you pay, Mr. creary?

29:52.810 --> 29:55.810
- The defendant, banks,
and his partner, Kim.

29:55.810 --> 29:57.840
- How much did you pay them?
- Twenty grand.

29:57.850 --> 29:59.750
- For each murder?
- That's right.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.080
- That sounds like
a lot of money.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.980
- You get the cops to do
the killing for you,

30:02.980 --> 30:04.820
you don't get caught.

30:04.820 --> 30:08.420
- Was Eric cates a member
of the 23rd street jokers?

30:08.420 --> 30:10.420
- Nah.

30:10.430 --> 30:11.960
That was personal.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.030
He ratted out my brother.

30:14.030 --> 30:16.100
- You're testifying here today
as part of a plea deal.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.530
Isn't that right?
- Yeah.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.440
- When the state's
attorney's investigators

30:25.440 --> 30:28.540
first questioned you about
the shooting of Eric cates,

30:28.540 --> 30:31.110
you pointed the finger at
somebody else, didn't ya?

30:31.110 --> 30:34.480
A man named Ricky marscak.
- That's right.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.220
- But he had nothing to do
with the attempted murder.

30:37.220 --> 30:39.450
- I just said it was me.

30:39.450 --> 30:41.820
- So then the jury can assume
that you're the sort of fella

30:41.820 --> 30:43.990
who'd just say anything
to save his own behind.

30:43.990 --> 30:46.060
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.230
- I had a couple drinks
with friends from work.

30:53.230 --> 30:55.770
- What did you do
when you left the bar?

30:55.770 --> 30:58.200
- I was going home,
and that's when I got shot.

31:01.580 --> 31:04.140
- Is that your car?
- Yes.

31:04.150 --> 31:06.010
- And that?

31:06.010 --> 31:08.510
- Looks like the dope
they found in my car.

31:08.520 --> 31:09.880
- What were you going to do
with it?

31:09.880 --> 31:13.190
- Nothing, 'cause it's not mine.

31:13.190 --> 31:15.520
They must've planted it
after they shot me.

31:21.600 --> 31:26.270
- Did you ever have any dealings
with a Jerome creary?

31:26.270 --> 31:28.630
- More with his brother, Jayson.

31:30.600 --> 31:33.170
It was a bad time in my life.

31:33.170 --> 31:35.770
I was doing drugs.

31:35.780 --> 31:38.040
I bought from Jayson.

31:38.050 --> 31:39.850
But I've been clean
for over a year.

31:39.850 --> 31:42.110
- Oh, well, that's good.

31:42.120 --> 31:45.580
And, uh, what instigated
your change in life?

31:47.120 --> 31:49.890
- I was arrested for burglary.

31:49.890 --> 31:51.960
- Really?
'Cause I checked your records,

31:51.960 --> 31:54.590
and I didn't see
any sign of that.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.900
- I made a deal.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.630
- What sort of deal?

32:01.640 --> 32:04.070
- I would give state
attorney's investigators

32:04.070 --> 32:06.040
information on Jayson creary.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.840
- So you're a rat.
- Objection.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.940
- Sustained.

32:09.940 --> 32:12.110
- You're a confidential
informant.

32:14.050 --> 32:15.920
- Yes.

32:15.920 --> 32:18.820
- In other words,
you wash away your own guilt

32:18.820 --> 32:20.250
by pointing the finger

32:20.250 --> 32:22.320
at someone you conducted
regular business with.

32:22.320 --> 32:25.090
- No, it wasn't like that.

32:25.090 --> 32:27.560
- He sold, you bought.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.130
That's business.

32:38.570 --> 32:41.640
<i>- You sure that's cates?
- That's him.</i>

32:41.640 --> 32:43.240
<i>Let's do this
so we can get some sleep.</i>

32:50.920 --> 32:53.790
- Do you recognize the voices
on that recording?

32:53.790 --> 32:55.650
- It's me and detective banks.

32:55.660 --> 32:57.020
- And both of you
fired the shots?

32:57.020 --> 32:58.690
- Yes.

32:58.690 --> 33:00.030
- What did you do then?

33:00.030 --> 33:02.660
- We planted the dope

33:02.660 --> 33:04.660
to make the shooting look like
part of a drug deal.

33:04.670 --> 33:07.770
- Where did you get the drugs?
- From Jerome creary.

33:07.770 --> 33:09.800
- It didn't concern you
that another detective

33:09.800 --> 33:11.700
would see a pattern
in the shootings?

33:11.710 --> 33:13.340
- Well, there wouldn't be
another detective.

33:13.340 --> 33:15.010
We made sure we were always
assigned the case.

33:15.010 --> 33:16.740
- So you committed the crimes,

33:16.740 --> 33:21.050
and then investigated them
yourselves?

33:21.050 --> 33:23.320
- You have to understand,

33:23.320 --> 33:25.820
detective banks
suckered me into all of it.

33:25.820 --> 33:27.290
He tells me my disabled boy

33:27.290 --> 33:28.950
deserves better
medical treatment,

33:28.960 --> 33:30.990
my girl needs
the best ballet instructors.

33:30.990 --> 33:33.690
I mean, I know it sounds bad,
but killing a gang banger?

33:33.690 --> 33:34.990
I mean, what's...
What's the difference?

33:35.000 --> 33:36.730
They would've killed
each other anyway.

33:36.730 --> 33:39.830
- Eric cates wasn't
a gang banger.

33:39.830 --> 33:42.940
- It got out of hand.

33:42.940 --> 33:45.040
What can I say?
I'm sorry.

33:52.410 --> 33:54.850
- So you're saying that

33:54.850 --> 33:57.780
if your boy wasn't disabled,

33:57.790 --> 34:02.320
and your daughter wanted to be,
say, just a housewife,

34:02.320 --> 34:04.720
then none of this
would've ever happened?

34:04.730 --> 34:06.930
- I don't know.

34:06.930 --> 34:08.960
- Well, I got
a pretty good idea.

34:13.830 --> 34:16.400
What's that?
- It's my house.

34:16.400 --> 34:19.100
- That's in edgebrook, right?
- Yeah.

34:19.110 --> 34:20.870
- Damn, I can't afford
to live there.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.710
- Objection.
- Eh, withdrawn.

34:22.710 --> 34:26.980
My point is you got a sob story.

34:26.980 --> 34:28.880
We all do.

34:28.880 --> 34:32.320
You get a little greedy.
We all are.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.750
But the thing is,
the rest of us?

34:35.760 --> 34:37.420
We don't kill for what we want,

34:37.429 --> 34:39.730
and we don't blame our partner
and our best friend

34:39.730 --> 34:41.929
for our own faults and failures!

34:41.929 --> 34:43.300
I'm done, judge.

34:53.909 --> 34:57.840
Well, this one sure gives you
a lot to think about.

34:57.850 --> 34:59.380
- No, it doesn't.

34:59.380 --> 35:03.080
Your client is
the worst kinda guilty.

35:03.080 --> 35:07.020
- Whatever he may seem to us,
he is a servant of the law,

35:07.020 --> 35:10.460
and therefore beyond
human judgment.

35:11.790 --> 35:14.160
It's from my kid,
Mr. smarty-ass college boy.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.400
He left his portable kafka
behind the toilet.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.730
I figured I'd give it a whirl.

35:18.730 --> 35:20.830
- That thinking may work in
absurdist novels,

35:20.840 --> 35:23.870
but not in real life.
- I don't know, Peter.

35:23.870 --> 35:26.810
That kafka, he's one smart dude.

35:27.970 --> 35:30.510
When you think about it,
you and me...

35:30.510 --> 35:34.080
We do our dances
in the courtroom.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.050
But that's all it is.

35:36.050 --> 35:38.750
We dance around the law.

35:38.750 --> 35:41.520
But banks, he puts on a badge
and a gun out on the street,

35:41.520 --> 35:43.460
and he lives, maybe dies by it.

35:43.460 --> 35:45.890
- So he can kill with impunity?

35:45.890 --> 35:48.430
- No, of course not.

35:49.500 --> 35:53.470
But this... this broken system
that we dance around with,

35:53.470 --> 35:57.000
I'm not so sure that
it's prepared to judge him.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.970
That's why I'm putting him
on the stand tomorrow.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.180
I gotta get home.

36:10.220 --> 36:14.390
- I heard how Stevie...
Detective Kim... testified.

36:14.390 --> 36:17.520
The fact is he's colored
the picture to his benefit.

36:17.530 --> 36:19.220
- Oh, please, explain.

36:19.230 --> 36:20.990
- I've lived in the same
apartment on the south side

36:21.000 --> 36:22.960
since I joined the force.

36:22.960 --> 36:25.400
I drive a corolla.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.970
Stephen's got a BMW.

36:26.970 --> 36:28.530
He's the one
who wanted the money.

36:28.540 --> 36:31.570
He was the lead detective
in every case.

36:31.570 --> 36:33.440
I just went along for the ride.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.110
- And why did you do that?

36:35.110 --> 36:38.810
- I've been doing this job
for almost 30 years.

36:38.810 --> 36:40.880
I've learned who's who
and what's what.

36:40.880 --> 36:43.550
I look at a guy for a second,
I know he's garbage.

36:43.550 --> 36:45.120
And these people we kill,

36:45.120 --> 36:48.090
they shoot you
as soon as look at you.

36:48.090 --> 36:49.990
City's been paying me
for 30 years

36:49.990 --> 36:51.920
to protect its citizens.

36:51.930 --> 36:54.130
And the people we shot...

36:54.130 --> 36:56.160
Drug dealers, junkies,

36:56.160 --> 36:59.260
killers themselves.

36:59.270 --> 37:02.470
Sooner or later, we'd have to
deal with them anyway.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.170
- Understood.

37:09.510 --> 37:11.840
- So this was all for
the greater good?

37:11.850 --> 37:15.950
- It's my job to do things
other people won't or can't do

37:15.950 --> 37:17.580
for the greater good.

37:17.590 --> 37:19.220
- It's interesting that you say
it was your job,

37:19.220 --> 37:21.250
detective banks.

37:21.260 --> 37:24.060
Did the city pay you to do it?
- In a way, yes.

37:24.060 --> 37:27.030
It's my job to get
the bad guys off the street.

37:27.030 --> 37:29.230
- The junkies, the dealers,
and the killers?

37:29.230 --> 37:32.200
- Look, I know
where you're going, Mr. stone.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.470
Were these shootings related to
ongoing investigations?

37:35.470 --> 37:37.200
No, they were not.

37:37.200 --> 37:40.910
But the thing is a good cop
never stops being a cop.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.170
- Right.
You see bad, you stop it.

37:42.180 --> 37:43.480
It's your job.
- That's right.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.040
- Right.
You can't help it.

37:45.050 --> 37:48.080
So the $80,000

37:48.080 --> 37:51.580
that you and your partner
took from Jerome creary?

37:51.590 --> 37:53.190
What was that?
Was that a tip?

37:53.190 --> 37:55.020
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

37:55.020 --> 37:56.490
- What was Eric cates?

37:56.490 --> 37:59.290
Was he a dealer,
a junkie, or a murderer?

38:00.260 --> 38:03.660
- He did business with creary,
a gang leader.

38:03.660 --> 38:07.100
- So you just assumed he was a...

38:07.100 --> 38:08.930
What did you call it?

38:10.600 --> 38:13.110
Garbage.
- That's right.

38:13.110 --> 38:15.640
- So the kid who mows
Mr. creary's lawn, he's garbage.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.680
- Course not.
- Why not?

38:17.680 --> 38:19.980
He did business
with a gang leader.

38:19.980 --> 38:22.010
Or what about the plumber
that fixes his pipes?

38:22.020 --> 38:24.320
Or what about you?
And detective Kim?

38:24.320 --> 38:29.050
Under your theory,
you're garbage too, right?

38:40.130 --> 38:42.940
- I read a story the other day
about an off-duty cop,

38:42.940 --> 38:45.140
who saw a suspicious
looking person

38:45.140 --> 38:47.940
approaching a 70-year-old lady.

38:47.940 --> 38:52.280
Now this copper, on his day off,
having no duty to do so,

38:52.280 --> 38:54.380
he decides to stop this guy,

38:54.380 --> 38:57.550
and damned if he doesn't find
a gun in his pocket.

38:57.550 --> 39:00.290
Well, that guy was gonna mug
that sweet old lady

39:00.290 --> 39:02.650
right there on wacker drive.

39:02.660 --> 39:05.690
The mayor himself
handed the cop a commendation,

39:05.690 --> 39:07.290
and called him a hero.

39:07.290 --> 39:09.130
Detective banks,

39:09.130 --> 39:11.260
he's caught a lot of bad guys
in his career.

39:11.270 --> 39:14.670
He's got a closet
full of medals to prove it.

39:14.670 --> 39:17.300
Now he doesn't do what he does
for a paycheck.

39:17.300 --> 39:20.610
No, he does it,
because that's who he is.

39:20.610 --> 39:23.110
To him, the right thing to do

39:23.110 --> 39:26.010
is to protect and serve
the people of Chicago,

39:26.010 --> 39:28.380
and that is what he did here.

39:28.380 --> 39:31.180
He protected all of us
from a cancer

39:31.190 --> 39:33.420
that is slowly
killing this city.

39:33.420 --> 39:37.260
What he did
was a public service.

39:45.400 --> 39:50.340
- Detective banks killed Garcia,
vargas, and Ortega,

39:50.340 --> 39:51.740
because they were bad guys.

39:51.740 --> 39:53.270
He tried to kill Eric cates,

39:53.270 --> 39:55.070
because he bought drugs
from a gangster.

39:55.080 --> 39:58.640
Still, he claims he's not
a cold-blooded murderer.

39:58.650 --> 40:00.380
Why?

40:00.380 --> 40:02.080
Because he works for
the government

40:02.080 --> 40:05.350
that's supposed to
take care of us.

40:05.350 --> 40:07.290
I read the newspaper too,
Mr. O'Boyle,

40:07.290 --> 40:10.420
and a lot of what I read
is about someone with a gripe,

40:10.420 --> 40:12.760
complaining their constitutional
rights have been violated,

40:12.760 --> 40:16.090
and demanding that
the government use its authority

40:16.100 --> 40:18.100
to do something
to make it better.

40:18.100 --> 40:21.700
I mean, this is America, right?

40:21.700 --> 40:25.140
Now I feel for those people.
I do.

40:25.140 --> 40:28.110
But what they're forgetting
is that first and foremost,

40:28.110 --> 40:30.310
the constitution was written

40:30.310 --> 40:34.350
to limit the government's
authority.

40:34.350 --> 40:36.350
Let me ask you this.

40:36.350 --> 40:40.820
Who has more authority than
a man with a badge and a gun?

40:40.820 --> 40:43.190
When he uses that authority

40:43.190 --> 40:45.790
to kill without
legal justification,

40:45.790 --> 40:50.100
he violates the rights
of all of us,

40:50.100 --> 40:52.230
and he should go to jail,

40:52.230 --> 40:55.300
and he should not get out.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.280
- On the first count,
first-degree murder,

41:06.280 --> 41:08.450
the jury finds the defendant
not guilty.

41:08.450 --> 41:10.680
On the second count,
first-degree murder,

41:10.680 --> 41:13.390
the jury finds the defendant
not guilty.

41:13.390 --> 41:15.450
On the third count,
first-degree murder,

41:15.460 --> 41:18.260
the jury find the defendant
not guilty.

41:18.260 --> 41:20.530
On the fourth count,
attempted first-degree murder,

41:20.530 --> 41:23.830
the jury finds the defendant
not guilty.

41:45.250 --> 41:47.890
- If I had gone to jail
for burglary,

41:47.890 --> 41:50.390
I would've been out
six months ago.

41:51.560 --> 41:53.260
- We will protect you.

41:55.330 --> 41:57.260
- Yeah.
