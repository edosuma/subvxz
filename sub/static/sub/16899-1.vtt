00:04.870 --> 00:06.428
You should see the girls that
work the factory floor.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.528
They actually make something
that matters!

00:08.570 --> 00:12.176
You told us you worked in an
office; that was the deal.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.871
I earned the right to
stand with these woman.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.445
Your new name is Kate Andrews.
Run Marlon run!

00:17.490 --> 00:19.879
Whatever you're running
from you're safe here now.

00:19.930 --> 00:22.364
A man like Marco Moretti should
not be working in the factory;

00:22.410 --> 00:24.401
it's a disaster
waiting to happen.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.626
I'm not ready to face
the world again.

00:27.670 --> 00:31.026
I thought maybe you have some
work for me in the office.

00:31.070 --> 00:34.801
I was telling Marco that there
maybe a factory girl on the way.

00:34.860 --> 00:38.557
I hope your girl is
happy with the news.
Her life's over.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.034
You always wanted me
in this war Gladys.

00:41.080 --> 00:44.459
I've seen your scars Kate,
I know he put them there.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.556
You have a new life here.

00:46.610 --> 00:49.568
Now I want my family back.
Goodbye.

00:49.610 --> 00:50.736
What about Kate?

00:50.780 --> 00:53.135
She's back where she
said she'll never go.

00:53.180 --> 00:54.568
I'll help you find her.

00:54.610 --> 00:57.568
Come on Bets we got
a war to win.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.264
This has to be my last, daddy.

01:37.310 --> 01:39.699
I'm late for my shift
at the factory!

01:39.750 --> 01:42.264
You're the face of Witham foods
we have to get it right.

01:42.310 --> 01:46.269
You realize I'm only any good
to you as long as I actually
keep this job of mine.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.276
I wouldn't dream of
slowmg you down.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.141
our ad campaign's whole
point is that this war is
our family's war too.

01:51.190 --> 01:54.068
"At Witham's, we're with 'em!"

01:54.110 --> 01:55.190
That's very good.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.288
Joining us at the
club this evening?

01:57.330 --> 01:59.230
I'm meeting friends
from the factory.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.678
Really? what is it, clear?

02:00.720 --> 02:02.722
beer and pretzels at
the pig and poke?

02:02.770 --> 02:05.022
That's right, I'm
"with 'em", mother!

02:19.310 --> 02:22.086
Ladies! We're working
with explosives.

02:22.140 --> 02:26.656
Metal can spark and
sparks can explode. Clear.

02:28.360 --> 02:30.703
The way you describe it, they
sound honest-to-god happy

02:30.750 --> 02:32.661
with you working here.

02:32.710 --> 02:35.497
Let's just say they figured
out what side the Witham's
bread is buttered on.

02:35.540 --> 02:36.711
And your fianc?

02:36.760 --> 02:38.580
Wish I could tell you.

02:38.630 --> 02:39.756
Doesn't he write?

02:39.810 --> 02:44.713
Sure, but then the
censors go to town.

02:44.770 --> 02:48.024
Drives me crazy, not
knowing what he's doing

02:48.080 --> 02:50.810
or when he'll ship out.

02:50.860 --> 02:53.249
I'm in the dark here,
and I don't like it.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.734
James is in officer's
training, princess.

02:55.780 --> 02:57.122
If he's already
dodging bullets,

02:57.170 --> 02:58.341
we're in real trouble.

02:58.390 --> 03:00.824
Ladies, we have some
visitors today.

03:00.870 --> 03:04.738
A delegation from the US. and
China is touring the plant.

03:04.790 --> 03:07.042
If you're called upon
to demonstrate,

03:07.090 --> 03:09.786
let's show our guest
what we women can do.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.796
America and China... here? why?

03:11.840 --> 03:14.183
We don't need to know
why, Miss Witham

03:14.230 --> 03:16.664
we just need to do our part.
Clear!

03:19.020 --> 03:21.534
Miss McRae a word?

03:21.590 --> 03:24.320
I'll keep the crew on a tight
leash today, ma'am, don't you

03:24.370 --> 03:26.281
Mr. Aikins received
this from a man

03:26.330 --> 03:27.979
who claims his
daughter worked here.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.589
"deviant freak"?

03:31.640 --> 03:33.505
this man accuses you of,

03:33.560 --> 03:36.859
making improper advances
toward the girl,

03:36.910 --> 03:38.593
he wants you fired.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.254
This is a lie,
Mrs. Corbett.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.256
You have no idea
what this is about?

03:43.910 --> 03:45.958
A Marion Rowley?

03:46.000 --> 03:52.439
No! no. It's disgusting.
And it's a lie.

03:52.490 --> 03:54.048
That's good enough for me.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.129
Clear.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.197
The general should know,
this is one of a dozen lines

04:06.240 --> 04:09.937
at Vic Mu going non-stop,
every day but Sunday.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.766
How many bombs has
the factory built?

04:11.810 --> 04:13.334
Nearly two million.

04:13.380 --> 04:15.848
Making Victory Munitions one
of the largest manufacturers

04:15.900 --> 04:18.209
in the commonwealth.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.684
Miss McRae, explain
what you're doing.

04:20.730 --> 04:24.029
Packing shell casings...
with propellant, cordite.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.900
That chemical smell
burning your nose

04:25.960 --> 04:27.166
tells you it's powerful stuff.

04:27.220 --> 04:29.438
Enough propellant to
take out an air craft.

04:31.090 --> 04:35.049
Each shell holds a cylinder,
that we fill with liquid amatol

04:35.100 --> 04:37.705
This is what does the damage.

04:37.750 --> 04:41.049
Once the amatol has cooled,
shells are joined to casings

04:41.100 --> 04:42.624
on the crimping line.

04:42.670 --> 04:44.831
Most of our munitions
are anti-aircraft

04:44.890 --> 04:47.233
which our americ_an friends
Will appreCIate.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.885
You'll excuse me for a moment,
please.

04:50.940 --> 04:52.635
Continue Miss Witham.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.593
My fianc, he's an officer's
training down at Fort Benning.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.461
I love the thought of our
bombs getting to him.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.645
The General asks how
your flanc feels

05:05.690 --> 05:07.942
about you doing such
dangerous work.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.776
Well, don't women work
China's bomb factories?

05:10.830 --> 05:13.822
They did, until the
factories were obliterated
by the Japanese.

05:15.090 --> 05:16.739
Of course.

05:18.310 --> 05:20.358
So then we move to
quality-control,

05:20.400 --> 05:23.961
where we check for spurs,
alignment and imperfections,

05:24.010 --> 05:26.922
Ventilation in
here is the pits.

05:26.970 --> 05:28.881
Matron's supposed to
enforce the rules.

05:28.930 --> 05:31.273
How come we got a pregnant
woman round cordite?

05:31.330 --> 05:33.104
Marco, for God's sake.

05:33.150 --> 05:35.493
Just calling them as
I see it, Lorna.

05:35.550 --> 05:38.110
Let's each of us mind
our own busmess.

05:38.160 --> 05:41.379
Are you still trying to tell
me the babys not mine?

05:47.390 --> 05:48.596
What's the issue?

05:48.650 --> 05:50.129
It's downsview, sir.

05:50.170 --> 05:51.819
They say it's urgent.

05:51.870 --> 05:54.384
The air force calling here?

05:54.440 --> 05:58.342
Harold Aikins.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.651
Good Lord.

05:59.700 --> 06:04.262
[AIR RAID SIREN]

06:04.320 --> 06:05.617
Is this a drill?

06:05.660 --> 06:07.878
People, we need to
evacuate, move!

06:07.930 --> 06:09.966
Get our guests to
the safe-station.

06:10.020 --> 06:11.703
No sir; this is real.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.897
Carol, get the girls
into the tunnels.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.373
What's going on?

06:23.420 --> 06:24.853
There's an unknown plane in
the restricted fly-zone

06:24.900 --> 06:26.208
headed straight for the plant.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.810
The train. They've been
loading boxcars all week.

06:28.860 --> 06:32.079
Good Lord there's_ a thousand
tons of exploswe on It.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.818
Mr. Aikens, are you coming?

06:34.870 --> 06:38.567
Soon. I need to get that train
away from the city. Downstairs!

06:41.270 --> 06:43.875
Buchinsky! Help me
shut this down.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.892
Wait! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

07:15.650 --> 07:16.730
Dotty Anderson...

07:16.780 --> 07:18.771
They got spotters
all over the city.

07:18.820 --> 07:20.731
They musta saw a
German aircraft.

07:20.780 --> 07:23.476
Or it's the Japs. Who knows
what's coming at us?

07:23.530 --> 07:25.430
Hitler's got u-boats
in the St. Lawrence.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.562
They sunk a ferry
off the coast of Labrador.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.224
Clearing the way for the
goddamned luftwaffe.

07:29.270 --> 07:30.965
Don't spook yourself.
It's crazy-talk.

07:31.010 --> 07:33.058
Crazy? Was Pearl Harbour crazy?

07:33.100 --> 07:34.533
Buster, You're taking
UP OXYGEN,

07:34.580 --> 07:36.400
Shake a leg and help me here.

07:36.450 --> 07:37.496
I'm afraid I don't
know your name.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.496
It's... Kai Low.

07:39.540 --> 07:42.623
"Kai Low" what does that mean?

07:42.670 --> 07:45.889
I dunno. What does"Witham" mean?

07:50.990 --> 07:52.890
Your english is
really quite good.

07:52.950 --> 07:57.034
My father is a marine,
married my mom in shanghai.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.775
You're an American
Interpreter. .?

07:58.820 --> 08:01.380
I'm with the US. army.

08:01.430 --> 08:04.900
Why? You liked me better all
Confucius and chop suey?

08:14.790 --> 08:18.351
I sure put my foot
in it upstairs.

08:18.410 --> 08:21.095
I really know nothing
about China.

08:21.150 --> 08:24.187
China's been fighting
the Japanese for more
than ten years.

08:24.240 --> 08:28.677
For us, their first hit was
just a few months back,
in Pearl Harbour.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.154
And Hong Kong, a lot of
our men died there.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.679
Even more are
prisoners of war.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.723
Well, if they treat
the Canadians like
they treat Chinese,

08:35.770 --> 08:39.297
those prisoners will
have a hard time surviving
Miss. Witham.

08:39.340 --> 08:41.513
_ But there are
International laws.

08:41.560 --> 08:44.688
Laws mean nothing if
their not observed.

08:44.740 --> 08:47.038

one nasty ally.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.183
Anytime.

09:52.890 --> 09:56.496
Nice talking to you, Miss.

09:56.550 --> 10:02.113
Hey, if you're the praying type,
pray the red cross reaches your
prisoners of war.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.685
Pray your fianc never
reaches Japan.

10:20.830 --> 10:22.138
Hey you alright?

10:30.670 --> 10:34.049
Apologies, the word is a
newsreel photographer

10:34.110 --> 10:36.237
just flew himself into
a lot of hot water.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.235
This way gentlemen.

10:42.550 --> 10:44.154
I can manage, thank you.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.804
Don't be silly,
let me help.

10:45.860 --> 10:48.681
Vera, please! Don't
make me say it.

10:48.730 --> 10:50.038
What?

10:50.080 --> 10:53.686
You can't go in with your...
you-know, scar.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.298
This is a big deal.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.818
We don't need red flags
over safety and whatnot.

10:57.870 --> 10:59.997
Just, go file. I can
handle luncheon.

11:17.540 --> 11:19.235
You seem pretty shaken up.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.328
Just tired.

11:21.370 --> 11:23.065
Took a walk last night.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.767
I still go out
most nights.

11:27.810 --> 11:31.075
Kate. Were you
looking for her?

11:35.300 --> 11:37.120
Nope.

11:37.170 --> 11:40.344
I worry about her too.

11:40.390 --> 11:41.869
So Betty!

11:41.910 --> 11:44.378
Seen you and Ivan Buchinslq
cozying up in the tunnel.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.739
What's the scuttle,
you staking a claim?

11:47.790 --> 11:49.087
Buchinsky's all right.

11:49.140 --> 11:51.267
Ladybug, he's a man between
fifteen and fifty.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.130
If you won't jump him,
I will.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.873
Betty's not jumping on anyone.

11:54.930 --> 11:56.488
why would you say that?

11:56.540 --> 11:58.576
Cuz... you're not
that kind of girl.

11:58.630 --> 12:01.235
Yes I am. Consider
my claim staked.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.451
I heard Gladys Witham was
up to stump a while back

12:08.510 --> 12:09.408
What'd she do,

12:09.460 --> 12:11.508
Take a trip to
chestnut street?

12:13.160 --> 12:17.039
I kept thinking down
there, what if I never
see my kids again?

12:17.080 --> 12:19.776
Can't imagine how scared
you'd be in your condition.

12:19.820 --> 12:22.687
And bob... what's he
say about it all?

12:22.740 --> 12:24.344
Haven't told him yet.

12:24.390 --> 12:28.349
It was hand-to-mouth on_his
pen5ion before I got this job.

12:28.390 --> 12:31.609
I'm waiting for the
right time to quit.

12:35.970 --> 12:39.269
Of course! I'd be happy to,
proud to!

12:39.320 --> 12:44.019
Absolutely! No, thank you!

12:48.240 --> 12:49.935
I just spoke with Red Cross,

prisoners of war.

You mean a holding hands
and kissing kind of date?

13:10.390 --> 13:11.652
Yep.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.601
So be there, okay?

13:14.660 --> 13:16.821
Case I need a
qUIck getaway.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.394
Sure. What are friends for?

13:21.140 --> 13:23.961
Lil Bambry's got a
baby four months old.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.625
Husband overseas,
never seen it.

13:26.670 --> 13:28.661
She leaves it at
the Sally Ann.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.756
They look after
children there now.

somebody has to.

Mom good news. I passed my
admissions test.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.722
I might actually get
into medical school!

13:40.770 --> 13:42.897
Sheila, that's wonderful.

13:42.950 --> 13:44.292
Look at this letter.

13:47.130 --> 13:50.600
"Every indicator of
a fine candidate."

13:50.650 --> 13:52.698
Well of course they
accepted her.

13:52.740 --> 13:53.911
why wouldn't they?

13:53.960 --> 13:56.520
They got the room.
All the boys are overseas...

13:56.570 --> 13:57.605
Bob!

13:57.660 --> 13:58.820
"Space" has nothing
to do with it Dad.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.871
I earned those grades
fair and square.

14:00.920 --> 14:06.051
Of course you did, Sheila,
I am so proud of you.

14:06.100 --> 14:09.490
I'm going up to Ellie's,
use the phone.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.838
Did you have to?

14:12.890 --> 14:14.710
We can't afford this, Lorna.

14:14.760 --> 14:20.198
You couldn't give the girl
have one minute of happiness?

14:20.250 --> 14:21.808
Your figure's changing.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.760
What's that?

14:23.810 --> 14:26.631
Dozing off on the couch
every night.

14:26.690 --> 14:30.649
It's no different than_when
you carried the twms.

14:30.690 --> 14:33.739
I know you, Lore, and
I know the signs.

14:33.780 --> 14:36.772
So I've gained a
bit of weight...

14:36.830 --> 14:40.084
Am I supposed to
believe it's mine?

14:40.140 --> 14:41.175
What?

14:41.220 --> 14:44.781
Our relations being
what they are,

14:44.840 --> 14:47.786
it would have to be a
bloody miracle.

14:47.840 --> 14:51.662
No... I'm not pregnant.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.496
Not a chance.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.907
The Maple Leafs, will take
the cup, no question!

15:18.960 --> 15:20.825
Players like Don Metz
and Sy| Apps?

15:20.870 --> 15:22.826
What about Turk Broda?
In goal?

15:22.870 --> 15:24.918
There's beauty, and
then there's Turk.

15:34.360 --> 15:37.409
I seen you, you take
pride in your work.

15:37.450 --> 15:40.624
What are you gonna do
with all the money
you're making?

15:40.670 --> 15:43.412
Truth? Buy a house.
My own house.

15:43.460 --> 15:44.757
A house.

15:44.810 --> 15:46.846
You don't think
I'm cracked?

15:46.900 --> 15:51.894
I think girls like you are
going to be running this place
before the war is over.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.019
[Huge Belch]

15:53.080 --> 15:56.516
[Both laughing]

16:05.660 --> 16:07.469
I hope it's not
too late.

16:07.530 --> 16:10.226
No, no, it's just
a surprise.

16:10.270 --> 16:14.263
What can I do for you?

16:14.320 --> 16:17.403
I want my old job
back on the line.

16:17.450 --> 16:19.884
Sorry, but I had to ask

16:19.930 --> 16:22.239
and I can't talk about
this at the factory.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.976
Things aren't working
out upstairs?

16:25.020 --> 16:27.454
Seems I'm not much
of an office girl.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.229
You're gaining
experience, Vera.

16:29.290 --> 16:31.895
you'll be glad to have
it down the road.

16:31.940 --> 16:34.500
I'm normally so much
tougher than this,

16:34.550 --> 16:36.029
but I just...

16:36.080 --> 16:38.947
My husband's at the legion,
there's a pot of tea on the go

16:38.990 --> 16:40.901
I shouldn't have
bothered you at home.

16:40.950 --> 16:44.818
It's easy for vain and
foolish girls to be cruel.

16:44.870 --> 16:51.878
You're more capable than that
whole knot of ninnies combined.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.878
Thank you, ma'am.

16:54.920 --> 16:59.311
Just today I heard loose
talk of Gladys Witham

16:59.360 --> 17:01.351
taking a three-day weekend.

17:01.410 --> 17:03.662
Oh that was just
a dirty rumour.

17:03.710 --> 17:04.369
Gladys was never...

17:04.410 --> 17:05.968
Oh of course not.

17:06.020 --> 17:09.012
they were saying something about
goings-on, on Chestnut street?

17:09.070 --> 17:10.458
Yeah, there's a place,

17:10.500 --> 17:13.105
a girl in trouble can get
things looked after...

17:13.160 --> 17:15.458
That's terrible,
what we've come to.

17:15.510 --> 17:18.547
There's another girl at the
factory, same predicament.

17:18.600 --> 17:20.989
I might go check
this place for her,

17:21.040 --> 17:22.462
see if it's appropriate.

17:22.510 --> 17:24.944
Chestnut street's a
rough neck of the woods.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.867
I can swing a mean handbag.

17:27.910 --> 17:29.252
Mrs. Corbett?

17:29.300 --> 17:32.781
If you're gonna go,
I'll go with you.

17:42.490 --> 17:45.880
Hello everyone, hello?!
We won't interrupt the
party long...

17:45.930 --> 17:48.012
We're taking collection
for the red cross,

17:48.060 --> 17:50.847
help our boys in
Japanese pow camps.

17:50.890 --> 17:52.846
It's terribly grim for
soldiers over there,

17:52.890 --> 17:54.972
so please, please,
give what you can!

17:55.030 --> 17:58.022
Open up, folks this
won't hurt a bit!

18:18.740 --> 18:20.002
Vera? I don't
think we...

18:20.050 --> 18:22.701
It's okay. We're here now.

18:35.110 --> 18:37.010
Go on; away with ya now.

18:38.070 --> 18:39.583
You in or you out?

18:43.200 --> 18:44.155
How'd you make out?

18:44.210 --> 18:46.462
A whopping dollar-fifty.

18:46.510 --> 18:48.159
That's double what I got.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.643
This is a travesty.

18:49.690 --> 18:51.772
Can I get you
ladies a drink?

18:51.820 --> 18:53.208
Yes!

18:53.260 --> 18:54.864
I'll try a shandy.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.692
Unless of course
you'd rather leave.

19:04.750 --> 19:08.572
oh, I don't need a rescue.
Ivan's great.

19:08.620 --> 19:10.929
Really? You mean that?

19:10.970 --> 19:14.622
Betty, aren't you
leading him on?

19:14.670 --> 19:16.058
Why would you say that?

19:18.800 --> 19:20.973
You're telling me your
heart's in this?

19:23.420 --> 19:25.934
This is what girls do.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.673
They date boys.

19:27.730 --> 19:30.244
And don't get arrested,
and they keep their jobs

19:30.290 --> 19:32.679
and don't have the whole
bloody world thinking

19:32.730 --> 19:33.856
they're "deviant freaks."

19:33.910 --> 19:34.945
Betty, I never...

19:34.990 --> 19:36.298
No you didn't.

19:36.340 --> 19:41.084
So don't go telling me where
my goddamned heart is.

19:41.130 --> 19:42.563
Ladies, drinks...

19:48.620 --> 19:49.609
Cheers.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.274
Actually, I got an
early morning.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.448
Ivan? how 'bout
a lift home?

19:58.500 --> 20:00.058
Aww yup.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.156
Another bit for your cause.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.893
Mr.L0!

20:12.950 --> 20:14.247
What're you doing here?

20:14.300 --> 20:17.167
I meant to hop off the
streetcar at your Chinatown,

20:17.210 --> 20:19.121
but I blinked and missed it.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.513
Dance?

20:21.560 --> 20:22.993
Yes, I dance.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.043
This girl you know,
how far gone is she?

20:30.090 --> 20:31.307
Is she's quick?

20:31.360 --> 20:33.828
The flutter of life,
she felt it yet?

20:33.880 --> 20:37.532
Oh no. No, it's
early weeks yet.

20:37.580 --> 20:40.663
A tea of pennyroyal,
tansy and cotton root.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.314
That will bring on her flow.

20:42.370 --> 20:45.533
I'll need to examine
the girl before I give
anybody anything.

20:45.590 --> 20:48.320
This girl. well, you see,
she's quite young,

20:48.370 --> 20:50.361
like many I expect
you meet...

20:50.420 --> 20:53.378
I will not treat a woman
I haven't examined.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.763
If it's just a tea,
couldn't you

20:55.810 --> 20:57.949
I don't take chances
with a woman's health.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.902
you either bring her to me,

21:00.950 --> 21:04.249
or find some other way
to stop the baby.

21:06.870 --> 21:10.124
That's fine, I'll
let her know.

21:18.180 --> 21:19.738
Mrs. Corbett.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.052
I never should have...

21:22.100 --> 21:23.795
Mrs. Corbett!

21:23.840 --> 21:25.796
She gives you a
bunch of herbs.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.365
You boil down a pot
of water to a quart,

21:28.410 --> 21:30.970
you drink it in one go.
Tastes like hell.

21:31.020 --> 21:33.636
Feels like you're gonna heave
or burst or both.

21:33.680 --> 21:40.153
You cramp real bad, you
bleed it out and it's done.

21:42.470 --> 21:44.074
And this girl?

21:47.300 --> 21:49.552
Tell her not to be afraid.

21:52.740 --> 21:57.211
Cause she's the one that
has to live with it.

21:57.270 --> 22:01.525
Whichever way it goes.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.293
You're a good dancer.

22:33.350 --> 22:34.476
For a Chinese guy?

22:34.520 --> 22:36.385
No for an American.

22:37.350 --> 22:39.079
My mom taught me.

22:39.140 --> 22:42.007
She worked in a cabaret in
Shanghai's international
settlement.

22:53.450 --> 22:56.328
And the Japanese
what do they do?

22:56.370 --> 22:57.678
You don't want to know...

22:57.720 --> 23:00.894
Yes I do. please.

23:00.940 --> 23:03.329
The Chinese army
had just retreated

23:03.380 --> 23:05.632
the Japanese started
shelling us civilians

23:05.680 --> 23:07.329
who were left behind.

23:09.080 --> 23:11.298
I watched the wounded
die on dance-floors

23:11.340 --> 23:13.331
not match different
than this one,

23:13.390 --> 23:17.349
And the Chinese
refused to surrender?

23:17.390 --> 23:21.121
Japan does not
respect surrender.

23:21.180 --> 23:24.434
It's a different
kind of war.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.436
We either win... or we die.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.190
She's got a man in there.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.892
You sure I should be up here?

23:49.950 --> 23:52.293
I felt like I was
crossmg enemy lines,

23:52.340 --> 23:54.649
A fellow up here
after ten o'clock.

23:56.340 --> 24:00.083
Wow. You drink like a sailor

24:05.440 --> 24:06.338
Betty?

24:06.740 --> 24:07.343
Betty.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.785
Betty, Betty, Betty. Whoa...

24:12.840 --> 24:14.614
What? Am I doing it wrong?

24:14.670 --> 24:16.183
No. No It's just,

24:17.450 --> 24:22.183
we both had a lot to drink.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.198
I want us both... to
remember your first time.

24:25.240 --> 24:28.152
It is your first time...

24:28.200 --> 24:28.677
Yeah.

24:32.640 --> 24:36.019
We take our time,
much as you need.

24:40.950 --> 24:43.862
Well I better get going
while I still can.

24:53.310 --> 24:54.265
Night.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.229
If last night is
any indication,

25:06.280 --> 25:09.454
it'll take months, years
before I can raise decent funds

25:09.500 --> 25:10.762
for the Red Cross.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.539
What did you expect,
passing the hat amongst

25:12.590 --> 25:15.286
jitterbugging soldiers
and giddy factory girls?

25:15.330 --> 25:16.763
Your mother's right, Gladdy.

25:16.810 --> 25:19.506
That's not how real
money gets raised.

25:19.560 --> 25:23.337
That's why I think we
should throw a proper
fund-raising party.

25:23.390 --> 25:25.950
People bring cash,
clothes, food...

25:26.000 --> 25:28.639
We are not asking guests
to dig in their attics

25:28.700 --> 25:30.474
for musty old bay blankets.

25:30.520 --> 25:33.045
Mother, you can assemble
a soire in a snap.

25:33.090 --> 25:35.399
With your guest-list we'd
raise a hundred times

25:35.440 --> 25:37.305
what I made last night.

25:39.660 --> 25:43.482
"At Witham's we're with'em,"
remember?

25:43.540 --> 25:46.407
if you really meant it, being
part of the great fight...

25:46.450 --> 25:47.576
then please.

25:49.630 --> 25:57.503
What if you had a
son over there?

25:57.550 --> 25:59.984
All right, Gladdy.

26:00.030 --> 26:02.590
And how do you propose to
inspire their generosity?

26:02.640 --> 26:04.642
You forget your daughter's
a war-worker.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.078
Believe me, I haven't.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.384
But you'll attend as a Witham
not a factory girl.

26:08.430 --> 26:10.478
They need to see how
much we're doing...

26:10.520 --> 26:12.647
Find another way to
inspire our guests.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.559
What's a benefit soir?

26:20.620 --> 26:22.349
It's a society party.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.448
Like in the
philadelphia story.

26:24.490 --> 26:26.538
All donated food
and comfort items

26:26.580 --> 26:30.107
will go to the Red Cross for
our boys in prison camps.

26:30.150 --> 26:33.756
And for us common
people, there's bingo
friday in the rec hall.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.620
"common" hardly.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.899
We're the women behind the
men who will win this war.

26:38.940 --> 26:41.283
Please say you'll come.

26:41.330 --> 26:45.369
What the heck how many chances
do I get to wear my good dress?

26:45.420 --> 26:49.459
Except you might be more
effective, in coveralls.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.125
Who goes to a fancy party,
in pants?

26:52.170 --> 26:55.992
My parents' friends have
no idea what it really
takes to fight a war.

26:56.040 --> 27:00.909
Blue shift girls in uniform,
showing we're with the boys

27:00.960 --> 27:03.428
that'll make 'em dig
in their pockets.

27:04.750 --> 27:06.308
Do we get champagne?

27:08.530 --> 27:09.576
You're on.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.404
I hope we're not
too late.

27:14.450 --> 27:17.362
That bus sure doesn't
run up this way very often.

27:17.410 --> 27:20.675
Unless you're a maid or gardner
you wouldn't be needing one.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.983
Holy doodle... this
is something...

27:29.860 --> 27:31.509
This isn't the back door!

27:31.560 --> 27:32.902
You're damn right.

27:32.950 --> 27:35.168
Well get in here, that way.

27:37.090 --> 27:37.738
Where's Betty?

27:41.610 --> 27:42.178
Taxi!

27:42.790 --> 27:43.859
Taxi!

27:49.660 --> 27:59.399
[Singing]

27:59.460 --> 28:09.506
[Singing]

28:09.550 --> 28:19.471
[Singing]

28:23.170 --> 28:25.604
Brothers and sisters!

28:25.660 --> 28:28.743
You may hide a dark heart
from others,

28:28.790 --> 28:32.226
but you cannot hide your
sinfulness from the Lord!

28:32.270 --> 28:35.489
Forsake your wickedness
or taste His wrath

28:35.530 --> 28:38.658
and burn in everlasting fire!

28:40.060 --> 28:43.234
It appears we face a demon.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.804
Bastard what've
you done to her?

28:44.850 --> 28:47.455
I brought her back
to the grace of God.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.717
There's no God here, Mister.

28:48.770 --> 28:51.455
Betty, you need to go.

28:51.510 --> 28:52.807
You don't mean that.

28:52.860 --> 28:55.545
The stuff you wrote in
that letter, it's lies.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.727
I have a boyfriend now!

28:57.770 --> 28:59.818
What letter? Father?

29:00.730 --> 29:02.607
He's trying to ruin me.

29:02.650 --> 29:04.515
You're well along
the road to hell.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.380
For they are an
abomination in...

29:06.440 --> 29:07.384
You shut up!

29:07.440 --> 29:09.249
the sight of the Lord!

29:09.310 --> 29:11.949
Touch me again and
I will kill you.

29:12.010 --> 29:13.819
Police..

29:13.880 --> 29:15.700
Betty, walk away he'll hurt you.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.263
I don't care, let him try.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.526
He'll hurt me, or worse.

29:18.580 --> 29:23.574
Go, go!

29:32.550 --> 29:33.414
Thank you.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.548
Thank you.

29:36.600 --> 29:40.809
We'll organize these in
piles bundle them up later.

29:42.730 --> 29:44.334
Have you seen Gladys yet?

29:44.390 --> 29:46.381
Probably fixing
her turban...

29:46.430 --> 29:50.343
Or trying a different look.

29:50.390 --> 29:53.086
Someone got to wear
her best dress.

29:53.130 --> 29:54.347
Oh don't hate me.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.130
It was the deal I had to
strike with my mother.

29:57.180 --> 29:59.398
Good evening.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.873
Thanks for inviting me.

30:00.920 --> 30:04.139
Nice digs for a
working girl.

30:04.190 --> 30:06.408
Thanks for coming.

30:06.450 --> 30:10.454
I want our guest to hear
first hand what our boys
are facing overseas.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.319
Wow.

30:11.370 --> 30:13.099
Look who's the pin-up girl.

30:13.150 --> 30:15.323
Betty Grable, eat
your heart out.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.548
I don't believe this.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.501
Miss Witham, hello.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.164
Kai Low,

30:26.210 --> 30:29.600
May I present Mr. Sharpe,
regional chairman for the
Red Cross.

30:29.650 --> 30:30.901
A pleasure.

30:30.950 --> 30:32.508
Isn't our lovely lady
a wonderful advocate?

30:32.560 --> 30:34.175
Indeed she is.

30:34.220 --> 30:37.178
There's such an urgent need for
food and medicine overseas.

30:37.220 --> 30:40.303
The Red Cross is sincerely
in your family's debt.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.089
Please excuse me.

30:49.490 --> 30:51.446
You're unveiling your
ad campaign now?

30:51.500 --> 30:55.106
A plum audience.
isn't it the cat's?

30:55.150 --> 30:57.106
This is a charity event!

30:57.150 --> 30:59.971
And a perfect occasion to
launch Witham's new brand.

31:00.030 --> 31:04.410
Daddy, a fund-raiser's no place
for some crass publicity stunt.

31:04.470 --> 31:05.767
Eye on the prize, dearest.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.164
I didn't sign my
friends up for this.

31:11.210 --> 31:13.997
It's the_ red cross
representative you should
focus on.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.691
Now, we have press from
all the daily papers.

31:16.740 --> 31:19.300
Be proud you're netting
a nice fat cheque

31:19.350 --> 31:20.658
for those prisoners.

31:20.700 --> 31:23.168
Here are some words
you're gonna wanna to say.

31:39.590 --> 31:41.626
Sit up.

31:41.680 --> 31:43.193
You're not quick?

31:43.240 --> 31:44.673
No. Nothing yet.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.540
You don't have much time.

31:48.860 --> 31:51.636
You said you see a
fair number like me?

31:51.690 --> 31:55.808
More than one'_s been left a
gift when their husband
goes overseas.

31:55.870 --> 31:59.692
Working women with their
shoulder to the wheel.

31:59.740 --> 32:03.779
And there's those who
shore up their loneliness
and wish they hadn't.

32:03.830 --> 32:06.879
I suppose war's a
bad time for babies.

32:06.920 --> 32:07.784
Yup.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.239
Look what the cat
dragged in.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.542
Shove it, powder-puff.

32:25.720 --> 32:26.630
Where's Gladys?

32:26.680 --> 32:28.193
Over there.

32:30.730 --> 32:32.595
Betty! you're late.

32:32.640 --> 32:33.857
I found Kate.

32:33.900 --> 32:35.629
Kate, is she okay?

32:35.690 --> 32:37.590
Her old man's put
her on a corner,

32:37.650 --> 32:38.639
spouting his malarkey.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.248
We gotta save her,
once and for all.

32:40.300 --> 32:41.688
"Save" her?

32:41.740 --> 32:43.731
Yeah she'll listen to you.

32:43.780 --> 32:46.123
You got a way of
handling these things.

32:46.180 --> 32:50.173
I've been ambushed here, I
can't leave these girls now.

32:50.220 --> 32:52.131
I have to say a speech.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.613
Can we go tomorrow?

32:53.660 --> 32:58.836
Tomorrow she'll be
long gone! Please.

32:58.880 --> 33:00.438
Kate is a grown woman.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.848
No. She can't.

33:04.890 --> 33:08.018
But you could if
you wanted to.

33:08.070 --> 33:09.890
Betty, wait!

33:09.940 --> 33:12.670
I can't believe this_ is how
you treat your friends.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.800
Bets, that's not fair.

33:13.860 --> 33:16.158
"Fair"? YOU said you'd hEIP.

33:16.210 --> 33:19.373
I have to stay the
course and play my part.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.774
I see they're playing
you right back.

33:29.650 --> 33:30.730
Gladys,

33:33.270 --> 33:35.044
You're everywhere.

33:45.540 --> 33:48.714
Guess you're not
here for the coffee.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.285
I've come to talk
about the baby.

33:55.070 --> 33:58.631
Look, I know I'm the father,
Lorna.

33:59.730 --> 34:01.857
It's okay.

34:01.900 --> 34:06.860
I couldn't tell you, I needed
to keep a clear head.

34:06.910 --> 34:09.640
I'm sorry. I can't
raise another child.

34:13.740 --> 34:16.391
Are you sure you making
the right decision?

34:16.440 --> 34:18.260
No.

34:18.310 --> 34:20.778
But I'm the one who
lives with it.

34:25.880 --> 34:29.839
So tell me what are
you domg here?

34:47.040 --> 34:49.338
Lorna, it's okay.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.400
Mr. Red Cross looks
like happy anyway.

35:13.450 --> 35:16.271
Mother practically has
her tongue in his ear.

35:16.330 --> 35:19.106
I'd swear they're trying
to snag a food contract

35:19.160 --> 35:20.673
from the Red Cross?

35:20.720 --> 35:24.156
Well if that's a crime, then
the whole world's doing it.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.077
I want to be the
good daughter.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.896
You_ know what
confUCIus would say?

35:28.950 --> 35:30.338
I've no idea.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.382
Yeah neither do I.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.603
But I can tell you
from my view,

35:34.650 --> 35:36.424
straddle two worlds
long enough,

35:36.480 --> 35:37.993
you end up nowhere.

35:53.450 --> 35:55.315
Smile, dear. Think
of your prisoners.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.315
Your father will
say a few words.

35:57.370 --> 35:59.930
Then up you go to present
our family donation,

35:59.980 --> 36:01.675
four hundred dollars.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.369
Did daddy snag a contract?

36:03.420 --> 36:05.103
Which contract is that?

36:05.160 --> 36:07.503
A supply-contract
with the Red Cross.

36:07.550 --> 36:09.415
I saw you working them, mother.

36:09.470 --> 36:12.337
It's not enough to go and shine
a spotlight on Witham foods,

36:12.380 --> 36:15.338
you have to funnel
every penny raised back
into your own pocket?

36:15.390 --> 36:18.029
The red cross has to buy
the food from someone.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.900
Everything's business
with you!

36:22.870 --> 36:25.179
You there! Vivian, Vanessa

36:25.220 --> 36:26.869
Vera.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.741
Run 'round and make sure
everyone has champagne
for the toast.

36:29.790 --> 36:32.099
The world is not
your staff, mother!

36:32.140 --> 36:34.222
What kind of bubble
do you live in?

36:34.270 --> 36:35.749
Same one as you!

36:35.800 --> 36:38.360
This business buys
you the privileges
you pretend to hate.

36:38.410 --> 36:41.459
You want to be of help?
Start with your own family.

36:55.470 --> 36:59.076
Our enemy taught us how
much we value the freedoms

36:59.120 --> 37:00.553
we took for granted.

37:12.700 --> 37:16.397
They taught us how,
when we bond together?

37:16.450 --> 37:20.318
There's nothing we
can't accomplish.

37:20.360 --> 37:24.490
But we aren't all together.
our boys were taken from us

37:24.540 --> 37:28.453
and until they're home
safe, they need our help.

37:28.500 --> 37:36.544
so I'm pleased to announce
we've raised $6,300 tonight,

37:42.650 --> 37:45.073
led by a donation
from Witham foods...

37:45.130 --> 37:47.690
of three thousand dollars.

37:49.570 --> 37:51.697
Every penny raised
goes not to food,

37:51.740 --> 37:56.484
but _to cru_cial medical
supplies delivered by the
international Red Cross.

37:58.970 --> 38:03.225
Lets raise a glass to our
boys and to ourselves,

38:03.280 --> 38:07.102
and to all we've done together.

38:07.150 --> 38:07.969
Cheers.

38:12.590 --> 38:14.194
You crossed the line.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.458
Medical supplies?

38:16.510 --> 38:17.329
The deal was

38:17.380 --> 38:19.541
Food, your food.

38:19.600 --> 38:23.331
But buying your way to a
contract doesn't come cheap.
Sorry.

38:23.380 --> 38:24.335
Clever girl.

38:24.380 --> 38:25.813
I hope you're proud.

38:25.860 --> 38:28.328
You have to decide
whos Side your on.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.379
Oh I have.

38:37.570 --> 38:40.175
You stood up to that
darkness, Marion.

38:40.230 --> 38:42.391
Your mother would be proud.

38:42.450 --> 38:43.963
I'd sure like to see her.

38:44.010 --> 38:45.568
We'll visit her soon.

38:45.620 --> 38:48.748
The sanitarium up in North Bay
is doing her a world of good.

38:48.800 --> 38:49.789
And, the boys?

38:49.840 --> 38:52.274
The boys, with your aunt.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.752
Just remember Marion,

38:53.800 --> 38:57.099
A little more money and
a little more faith

38:57.160 --> 38:59.025
and you know what.

38:59.070 --> 39:01.026
The land of milk
and honey.

39:07.910 --> 39:08.592
Kate.

39:10.780 --> 39:11.678
Betty...

39:12.480 --> 39:14.641
Please. Let me help you.

39:14.700 --> 39:18.477
I gave my daughter life,
you will not destroy it.

39:19.790 --> 39:22.873
It's nothing but
lies that you tell her.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.785
Mom'_s not sick in
hospital, is she?

39:24.840 --> 39:26.523
This jezebel filled
you with poison.

39:26.580 --> 39:29.265
She left. Couldn't
stand it anymore!

39:29.320 --> 39:31.094
Do you want the truth?

39:31.150 --> 39:32.924
Do you want the truth?!

39:33.630 --> 39:34.449
Your mother is dead.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.582
And I'm all you have.

39:36.630 --> 39:38.939
No... no, you're lying!

39:38.980 --> 39:40.754
Marion, it was
to protect you...

39:40.810 --> 39:43.938
You lied to me, just so
I would stay with you,

39:43.990 --> 39:46.413
It was so you
wouldn't suffer.

39:47.730 --> 39:53.259
Living with you is misery
every day of it!

39:53.300 --> 39:54.904
You shut it now.

39:54.950 --> 39:55.860
You shut it!!

39:55.910 --> 40:00.518
No I won't shut it.

40:00.570 --> 40:01.468
Get off of her.

40:05.830 --> 40:08.435
It's me you want,
come and get me.

40:14.620 --> 40:15.621
Let her go!

40:16.580 --> 40:17.365
Stop!

40:21.810 --> 40:22.674
Oh my God.

40:34.950 --> 40:36.463
c'mon...

40:36.520 --> 40:38.681
you can stop, Betty.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.685
He's dead.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.871
He seems so small.

40:51.620 --> 40:53.576
You stay here. I'll
get the police.

40:53.620 --> 40:54.928
We're not doing that.

40:54.970 --> 40:56.449
It's the right thing.

40:56.490 --> 40:57.479
We owe him that.

40:57.540 --> 41:00.577
No. We don't owe
him a thing.

41:44.240 --> 41:47.539
It's okay,

41:47.590 --> 41:48.978
I feel you.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.254
I'm sorry.

42:07.780 --> 42:09.736
Let's go find her.

42:15.960 --> 42:16.915
Kate.

42:18.920 --> 42:19.705
You're back!

42:24.930 --> 42:26.659
Are you all right?

42:26.710 --> 42:27.756
You're safe?
