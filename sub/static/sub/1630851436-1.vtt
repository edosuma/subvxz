<i>♪ ♪</i>

00:15.648 --> 00:17.650
- Oh, my God.

00:18.685 --> 00:21.254
This is just painful.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.824
The kid on that bassoon
is ruining the whole thing.

00:24.891 --> 00:26.493
- Who, me?
What's happening?

00:26.559 --> 00:29.262
- My daughter, Dakota,
practiced very hard for this.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.164
- Dakota, say something.
Your mom's out of control.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.566
- I'm kinda in a tough spot
here, Tom, sorry.

00:33.666 --> 00:34.934
- Hey, lady!
- Oh, no.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.236
- How about you mind
your own business?

00:36.336 --> 00:37.537
- Ma, sit down.

00:37.604 --> 00:39.005
- My son plays bassoon
like an angel.

00:39.072 --> 00:40.273
- Yeah, well,
he's a sucky little angel,

00:40.373 --> 00:41.941
and he sucks at bassoon.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.277
- Oh, is this the day I fist
fight in front of my child?

00:44.377 --> 00:46.746
- Ladies, please,
let's be civil.

00:46.846 --> 00:49.416
Tom, play us a quick solo

00:49.516 --> 00:52.952
to show everyone how hard
you've been practicing.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.387
- There's no such thing
as a bassoon solo.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.022
That's why
I chose the instrument.

00:56.089 --> 00:57.690
- Just play anything.

00:57.757 --> 00:59.626
Stravinsky's Fifth in G minor.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.028
- I have too much respect for
my craft and for Stravinsky.

01:02.095 --> 01:03.129
I won't do it.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.964
- Have you studied anything?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.433
Just play something.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.068
- Okay, fine.
Here's a little of, uh,

01:08.134 --> 01:10.036
Beyonce's
"All the Single Ladies."

01:10.103 --> 01:13.206

that felt completely wrong.</i>

02:23.877 --> 02:26.379
We'll revisit that.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.014
- Hey.
- Tom, Tom, Tom.

02:28.114 --> 02:29.449
- Hey, buddy.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.950
- You know why I called
you in here, right?

02:31.017 --> 02:32.552
- I don't know,
just general chit chat?

02:32.652 --> 02:34.154
- Well, I'm getting
a lot of complaints

02:34.220 --> 02:35.822
about the bassoon incident.
- Complaints?

02:35.889 --> 02:36.956
- They say
you're "dead weight."

02:37.023 --> 02:38.291
- Dead weight?

02:38.358 --> 02:39.459
- One parent called you
"an albatross."

02:39.526 --> 02:40.827
- Is that good or bad?

02:40.894 --> 02:42.462
- Listen,
I was hoping you'd give up band

02:42.529 --> 02:44.197
and try something different,
like baseball.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.732
- Oh no,
I'm more of a bassoon guy.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.200
- What does that even mean?

02:47.300 --> 02:48.668
- I love sitting in
the background

02:48.735 --> 02:50.336
with a large,
nondescript instrument,

02:50.403 --> 02:52.739
just flapping my lips
willy nilly.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.174
- Tom.
- Yeah?

02:54.240 --> 02:55.575
- I want you to listen
to what I'm saying.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.210
There's defining moments
in your life

02:57.310 --> 02:59.045
that if you listen,
it'll change your whole life.

02:59.145 --> 03:01.247
I played the tuba as a kid,
and look where it got me now.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.415
- You seem
like you're doing great.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.850
- I'm lonely, I'm overweight,

03:03.917 --> 03:05.084
and I'm a light stealer.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.152
I light steal.
There, I said it.

03:06.219 --> 03:07.487
- You steal things?

03:07.554 --> 03:08.821
- Not, like,
literally in my pocket,

03:08.888 --> 03:10.523
but I leave things
under the basket,

03:10.590 --> 03:12.091
I put it up against the side,
hope they don't see it.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.359
- Oh.

03:13.426 --> 03:14.594
- Is that what
you want to turn into?

03:14.694 --> 03:16.095
- I mean, you're not selling me

03:16.196 --> 03:17.530
on the whole lifestyle, no.

03:17.597 --> 03:19.365
- Just give it some thought.
That's all I ask.

03:20.099 --> 03:22.435
- Hey, Tom, what's up, man?
- Hey, Nelson.

03:22.535 --> 03:23.770
- Hey, you want
to come over later?

03:23.870 --> 03:25.205
- Nah, I've got
a lot on my mind.

03:25.271 --> 03:26.773
- A lot on your mind?
You're 10!

03:26.873 --> 03:28.241
These are
the glory years, baby.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.076
- These are the glory years?
- Yeah.

03:30.176 --> 03:31.611
Once we hit our teens,
we're old.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.213
What's up, man?
Talk to me, baby.

03:33.279 --> 03:34.948
- The principal says
I need to decide

03:35.048 --> 03:36.516
between bassoon and baseball.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.851
- That's a tough decision.
- You playing baseball?

03:38.918 --> 03:40.053
- Hell, no.

03:40.119 --> 03:41.120
My dad encourages me

03:41.221 --> 03:42.455
to be an owner, not a player.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.923
- Not like a fun childhood,
but--

03:44.023 --> 03:45.558
- Baseball players
get way more action.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.026
- Who are you talking to?
Me?

03:47.093 --> 03:49.395
- I'm talking to everybody
within earshot.

03:49.462 --> 03:50.463
- What's action?

03:50.563 --> 03:51.531
I'm not familiar
with the phrase.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.266
- Tail.
- Tail?

03:53.366 --> 03:54.867
- Trim.

03:54.934 --> 03:57.470
Don't make me say pussy, guys!
There's kids on this bus.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.938
- Hey, whoa!
- That's the word from TV.

03:59.038 --> 04:00.373
- Why are
you talking about sex?

04:00.440 --> 04:01.808
I'm not even interested
in girls yet.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.376
- I'm just trying to help,
because I know

04:03.443 --> 04:06.079
bassoon players
are basically celibate.

04:06.145 --> 04:07.747
- I think
you got your facts wrong.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.816
- They basically live
like monks.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.218
- Take it back.
- I'm not taking it back.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.953
Bassoon players,
they get nothing.

04:14.053 --> 04:16.322
Baseball players
are swimming in ladies.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.957
- Psst, Tom.
- Yeah?

04:18.057 --> 04:20.460
- This bus driver is literally
the coolest guy we know.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.562
If he says play baseball,
you gotta play baseball.

04:22.629 --> 04:23.830
- You think he's cool?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.064
- Hell, yeah,
I think he's cool.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.499
- I like this kid.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.001
You've got a stage whisper,
they call it.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.736
- You heard all that?
- I have sharp ears.

04:29.802 --> 04:33.640
I am the ear equivalent
to a sharpshooter assassin.

04:35.174 --> 04:38.111
- Let's go, guys.
Jimmy, Chris, eye of the tiger!

04:38.177 --> 04:39.412
Stop looking like
a fool out there.

04:39.479 --> 04:40.847
Come on!
You're making a fool of me!

04:40.947 --> 04:42.181
- Hey, coach?
- Wh--Tom!

04:42.282 --> 04:43.316
- Hey, coach.
- Hey, buddy.

04:43.416 --> 04:44.617
- Am I in the right place?

04:44.684 --> 04:46.286
- Tom, you are
obviously in the--Chris!

04:46.352 --> 04:48.521
Would you move back!
- Oh, my God.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.089
- You are in the right place.
You ready?

04:50.156 --> 04:52.358
- No, these kids seem
a little bigger than me.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.960
- Yes, they're a little big.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.162
Parents hold them back
for size advantage, it's fine.

04:56.262 --> 04:57.530
- The pitcher
is literally shaving.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.198
- I mean,
he did drive to the game,

04:59.299 --> 05:02.101
and he's a little hairy.
- The kid looks like he's 32.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.936
- Tom, I need you
to get your uniform together

05:04.003 --> 05:05.938
and get out there.
- Oh, do people tuck it in?

05:06.005 --> 05:07.507
- Yes, they tuck it in.

05:07.607 --> 05:10.209
- I prefer to not tuck,
if that's an option.

05:11.544 --> 05:12.779
- Whoo whoo!

05:12.845 --> 05:15.048
Come on, Tom!
You can do it, buddy!

05:15.148 --> 05:17.984
- Oh, my God.
This old bag again?

05:18.051 --> 05:19.352
- I'm here supporting my son.

05:19.452 --> 05:21.654
- I thought
you went home and died.

05:21.721 --> 05:24.123
- Just ignore the lunatic
from the recital, baby.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.858
She is drunk on chardonnay,

05:25.958 --> 05:28.194
and she is begging
to get slapped.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.330
- Let's go, kids!
Let's go!

05:30.396 --> 05:32.065
Let's go, Tom.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.967
- Strike one!

05:35.034 --> 05:36.703
- Whoa!
Is that--is that legal?

05:36.803 --> 05:38.037
- Throwing the ball?
Yes.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.739
- This kid's a monster.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.075
Whoa!
- Strike two!

05:42.175 --> 05:43.743
- Oh, my God.
That could have killed me.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.511
- That could have killed you.
It was pretty fast.

05:45.578 --> 05:47.547
- All right,
let's all slow it down,

05:47.647 --> 05:49.349
and uh, let's do this again.

05:49.415 --> 05:50.817
- Mm.

05:50.883 --> 05:53.219
Oh, no.
Whoops.

05:53.319 --> 05:54.921
- What just happened?
You okay?

05:55.021 --> 05:56.556
- Can I have a quick word?

05:56.656 --> 05:58.424
- Uh, yeah, it's not like
anything important's happening.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.260
- It's not a big deal, but I'm
gonna need a change of pants.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.829
- Okay.

06:02.895 --> 06:04.831
- I can't imagine you have
extra pants on you, do you?

06:04.897 --> 06:06.265
- What, you don't like
the pants you're wearing?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.401
- I just pooped--
I just pooped my pants.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.702
- Oh.

06:09.769 --> 06:11.003
- I told you he was
pitching too fast.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.338
The whole thing's
very stressful.

06:12.405 --> 06:13.773
I'm used to more
of a bassoon atmosphere.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.441
- Okay, listen.
This happens quite a lot.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.443
We have a way to handle
this kind of situation.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.878
- Thank you.
I appreciate that.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.279
- You're outta here!
- Wait, what?

06:20.380 --> 06:21.681
- Player ejected!
- Stop.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.182
- Pooped his pants!
- He's kidding.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.718
- This guy right here
pooped his pants!

06:25.785 --> 06:27.086
- Okay, I just want
to say for the record,

06:27.186 --> 06:28.521
there was
some false reassurance.

06:28.588 --> 06:29.789
- It's in the rule book.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.791
- Rule number 33
- B,
"No player shall defecate

06:31.891 --> 06:33.192
"his or her uniform

06:33.259 --> 06:35.194
or defecate the uniforms
of another player."

06:35.261 --> 06:36.896
You're outta here!
Take a seat!

06:36.963 --> 06:39.966
-
You're doing great, Tom!

06:40.066 --> 06:42.635
Don't say a word, lady.
Don't you dare say a word.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.406
- Pooped your pants?

06:46.472 --> 06:48.608
Pooped your pants?
Tom, this is a disaster!

06:48.708 --> 06:50.209
- People noticed?
People noticed that?

06:50.276 --> 06:51.544
- Of course they noticed.

06:51.611 --> 06:53.045
It's all
everybody's talking about.

06:53.112 --> 06:54.280
- You know what?
I'm going to quit.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.748
I'm going to quit baseball.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.383
- You can't quit.
You gotta redeem yourself.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.318
Otherwise, this is how people
gonna remember you,

06:59.419 --> 07:00.820
and you'll drag me down
with you.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.822
- Hey, little dudes, lean in.
- Oh, God.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.223
- You can play baseball.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.160
All you need is
a little confidence boost.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.161
- What?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.896
- A little juice.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.064
A little Vitamin S.

07:12.131 --> 07:14.400
- I know we leaned in for this,
but I'm totally lost.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.502
- A little bit of muscle pop.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.937
- I think he's talking
about 'roids, Tom.

07:18.004 --> 07:19.172
- What, what?

07:19.272 --> 07:20.606
- And I like
where this is going.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.074
- That's right.
- I'm not doing steroids.

07:22.141 --> 07:23.676
- Come on, man.
- I don't want to cheat.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.745
- It's not cheating
if everybody does it.

07:25.812 --> 07:26.779
All the pros do it.

07:26.846 --> 07:27.847
I bet even the managers

07:27.947 --> 07:29.315
are doing it at this point.

07:29.415 --> 07:30.650
- It just sounds very shady.

07:30.750 --> 07:31.918
- Tom!

07:31.984 --> 07:33.186
- All right,
you don't have to stop.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.654
- This is
what we're going to do.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.155
Hide under a seat in the back.
- Okay.

07:36.255 --> 07:37.690
- When I drop off
that girl with the braces,

07:37.790 --> 07:39.358
you're free to come
out of your hiding spot.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.360
We're going to drive
past the county line,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.095
and we're gonna meet
my buddy Glenn.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.530
He's gonna give us the stuff,

07:44.630 --> 07:45.965
we are right as rain.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.533
- That goes against
so many of my mom's rules

07:47.633 --> 07:48.935
I can't even tell you.

07:49.001 --> 07:50.670
- Listen,
rule number one of drug deals.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.439
Don't get your mom involved.
I learned that the hard way.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.044
<i>- Right out of the gate,</i>

07:58.144 --> 07:59.712
why does this guy
have a bag on his head?

07:59.812 --> 08:01.347
- I'm a future franchise owner.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.449
I don't support "'roids."

08:03.516 --> 08:04.984
- Just act cool.

08:05.051 --> 08:06.853
Glenn is on his way out here
with the soft pretzels.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.387
- Soft pretzels?
I thought we're here for drugs.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.224
- Shh, at these things,
we use code words.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.326
Soft pretzels means drugs.

08:13.392 --> 08:15.328
- Oh, I like that.
That sounds legit.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.897
- Coincidentally,
I am also treating you guys

08:17.997 --> 08:19.332
to soft pretzels.

08:19.398 --> 08:20.800
- Wait, shouldn't we pick
a different code word?

08:20.867 --> 08:22.235
- Well, we can't change it now.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.669
That would make it
even more complicated.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.004
- This is complete chaos.

08:25.071 --> 08:26.405
- Woot woot!
Ah, what's up, players?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.974
- Please don't tell me
this is Glenn.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.375
- King of the food court,
you know what I'm saying?

08:29.475 --> 08:30.409
Straight up.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.410
- Don't have a good feeling

08:31.511 --> 08:32.712
about this guy at all.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.046
- This dude's the king
of the mall.

08:34.146 --> 08:35.481
Bow before him.
- Hell, yeah.

08:35.548 --> 08:36.749
Anybody want
some soft pretzels?

08:36.849 --> 08:38.417
Wink wink.
- What's happening?

08:38.518 --> 08:39.585
These are pretzels,
or these are drugs?

08:39.685 --> 08:40.653
I'm not following.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.754
- It's the juice to get loose

08:41.854 --> 08:42.922
on the diamond, dog.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.590
- Juice?
Is that an expression or--

08:44.690 --> 08:46.359
- It'll make you hard
as a diamond on the diamond.

08:46.425 --> 08:47.927
You know what I'm saying?
- I'm not tracking any of this.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.529
- Conseco-style, dog.
- Conseco?

08:49.595 --> 08:51.097
- There's going to be so
many girls at the ballpark,

08:51.197 --> 08:52.665
dog, they're going to
have to call a rain delay

08:52.732 --> 08:53.866
because it's going to
get so wet in there.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.101
Straight up.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.602
- What the hell's happening,
Tom?

08:56.702 --> 08:58.070
It's hard to track
the story from under here.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.672
- Okay, just act natural
as I discreetly

08:59.739 --> 09:01.674
stuff the junk
into Tom's backpack.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.042
Glenn, cover me.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.611
- I got your six, player.
Eyes and ears in motion.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.614
- What kind of cheap-ass
backpack is this, Tom?

09:08.714 --> 09:10.049
- It was a gift
from my grandmother.

09:10.116 --> 09:11.417
It's not high quality.

09:11.517 --> 09:13.052
- Man, your bag
smells like Sun Chips.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.453
- This drug deal
is off the rails.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.422
- Oh, look!
It's Tom, from band!

09:16.522 --> 09:19.225
- Oh, no.
- What's going on here, Tom?

09:19.292 --> 09:21.027
- I'm just hanging out
here with my friends.

09:21.093 --> 09:22.395
This is,
uh, my buddy, the bus driver.

09:22.461 --> 09:23.796
- Hi, how you doing?

09:23.896 --> 09:25.565
- And this is Nelson.
- Nice to meet you.

09:25.631 --> 09:26.933
- And I believe
this guy's name is Glenn.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.301
- Hooking my boy up
with some snacks,

09:28.401 --> 09:29.969
not leaving tracks,
straight up.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.405
- This is why I don't
like you talking to him.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.807
It's this kind of stuff,
right here.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.309
- I'm watching you, Tom,

09:36.409 --> 09:38.778
and wherever you go,
someone will be watching.

09:38.878 --> 09:39.979
- Okay.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.247
- Guess who's
gonna be watching?

09:41.314 --> 09:42.815
- Got to assume
it's you, right?

09:42.915 --> 09:44.650
- Don't talk back to me.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.654
- Oh, yeah.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.489
That is how you swing a bat.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.991
- Tom.
- Hey, coach.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.593
- Look at you.
You are amped for this game.

09:53.659 --> 09:55.294
- Feeling confident,
feeling loose.

09:55.394 --> 09:57.964
- Tom, look at me right now.
I can't put you in.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.498
- Oh, no.
I have to play.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.968
- You didn't have what
we'd call a "strong debut."

10:02.068 --> 10:03.102
- Oh, no.
Come on.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.337
I'm a new man.
Look at my body.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.471
- Listen, you can't.

10:05.571 --> 10:06.839
- Coach,
you gotta let me play

10:06.939 --> 10:08.341
or I'm gonna slap you
in your face.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.742
I'm gonna slap you right now.
- I'm sorry.

10:09.809 --> 10:10.910
- I say the kid plays.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.645
- Who--
Okay, who are you?

10:12.745 --> 10:14.680
- Hi, I'm Nelson, new owner.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.350
- This is adorable, but
you can't "own" one of these.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.019
This is more of like a--
it's like a sponsorship.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.587
- My name's on the shirt.
Look down.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.190
Now look up.
Let's not get into semantics.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.858
Suit up, baby.
You're going in.

10:25.958 --> 10:26.859
- Thank you.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.260
- So you just--

10:28.327 --> 10:29.996
you're just going to
listen to him like that?

10:30.096 --> 10:31.931
- It seems like he's the owner,
from what I'm being told.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.034
- All right, here we go.

10:36.535 --> 10:38.304
- Strike one
for the pants pooper!

10:38.371 --> 10:39.639
- You don't have to
keep bringing that up.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.040
We've all moved on.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.009
- The memory still lingers.
- All right.

10:43.843 --> 10:47.179
- Strike two,
for Shitty Shitty Pants Pants.

10:47.279 --> 10:48.981
- That's crossing the line.
- What would you prefer?

10:49.048 --> 10:50.549
- I know it got a laugh,
but it's crossing the line.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.051
- Look.
I apologize.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.352
- All right, here we go.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.221
Come on, Tom.
You can do this.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.557
We are all juiced up
and ready for action.

11:04.697 --> 11:09.201
<i>♪ ♪</i>

11:10.870 --> 11:13.172
- And that one is out of here!

11:13.239 --> 11:15.574
- Oh, I'm on top of the world.
What a day.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.576
Best day of my life.
Thanks, Ma.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.078
- I'm proud of you, buddy!

11:19.178 --> 11:20.746
- Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.081
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:22.181 --> 11:23.649
Whoa, whoa.
Stop clapping.

11:23.716 --> 11:24.884
And put him down.

11:26.152 --> 11:29.588
Does no one else find it
suspicious that this kid

11:29.689 --> 11:32.258
with this body
just hit a home run?

11:32.358 --> 11:35.594
I want him tested for
performance-enhancing drugs,

11:35.695 --> 11:37.763
right now.
- What?

11:37.863 --> 11:39.598
- Wait, what?
Drugs?

11:39.699 --> 11:43.436
- Are you out of your mind?
My Tom's a great kid.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.337
- Oh, if he's such a great kid,

11:45.404 --> 11:48.207
let's see him whip out his dong
and give us a urine sample.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.042
- Can you say dong
at a little league game?

11:50.109 --> 11:51.744
I wasn't aware
you can say that.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.548
- Come on, Tom, whip it out.

11:55.614 --> 11:56.916
- You know what?

11:57.016 --> 11:58.784
I don't think this
is going to go away.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.519
I, uh, I've got
a confession to make.

12:00.586 --> 12:03.456
I did drugs.
I'm all jacked up on 'roids.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.792
- I knew it!
- Tom, no!

12:06.892 --> 12:08.861
- That's why I look
so freakishly muscular.

12:08.928 --> 12:11.397
- Um, those weren't drugs, Tom.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.765
- Where did you come from?

12:12.865 --> 12:14.433
- They were
mint flavored Mentos.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.303
- Oh, those are my favorite.
- Yes, they're delicious.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.606
They're not quite candy,
and they're not quite mints.

12:20.706 --> 12:22.141
- No, if they weren't drugs,

12:22.241 --> 12:23.776
why would I shove them
up my butt every six hours?

12:23.876 --> 12:26.245
- I don't know
who told you that, Tom.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.813
All I know is,

12:27.913 --> 12:29.882
I saw a child
who was struggling

12:29.949 --> 12:31.484
and needed a confidence boost.
So...

12:31.584 --> 12:32.885
- What's happening?

12:32.952 --> 12:34.987
- I let him believe the drugs
were real,

12:35.087 --> 12:36.989
but it was really you
all along.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.892
You had the power inside you.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.827
Aw.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.429
- Aww?
Don't say "aww".

12:43.496 --> 12:45.297
This maniac staged
a fake drug deal!

12:45.397 --> 12:47.833
- Yeah, but Tom, his heart
was in the right place.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.270
- What a great guy.
- Seriously, what a hero!

12:51.337 --> 12:53.172
- Free drinks
for the bus driver on me!

12:53.272 --> 12:54.740
Let's do it!
Woot woot!

12:54.807 --> 12:56.242
Yeah!

12:56.308 --> 12:58.144
- You're carrying him away?

12:58.244 --> 13:00.746
- I'm tearing up right now.

13:00.813 --> 13:02.848
- That feels like a bit much.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.284
- This was a terrible
season opener for the Nelsons.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.186
Man, this is a bad investment.
