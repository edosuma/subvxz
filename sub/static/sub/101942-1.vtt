11:13.833 --> 11:15.500
It's been two years.

11:15.541 --> 11:17.125
It's not been two years.

11:17.166 --> 11:19.666
Two years, no face, nothing.

11:19.708 --> 11:21.666
So Google showed you the way home?

11:22.375 --> 11:23.458
I've come from work.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.333
You owl face!

11:25.375 --> 11:28.083
You were supposed to text me
when you landed.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.875
You doing OK?

11:41.291 --> 11:43.000
You've lost weight.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.208
You don't eat enough.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.375
You're fasting?

11:47.416 --> 11:48.541
No.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.250
Good. No need
when you're travelling.

12:10.041 --> 12:11.708
The one we have is just fine.

12:16.208 --> 12:18.833
Do you smell anything?

12:23.708 --> 12:24.875
The peppers have no smell.

12:26.541 --> 12:29.416
You've got the 'evil eye'.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.250
How's your Bina?

12:33.750 --> 12:34.833
Is she fine?

12:35.875 --> 12:38.208
Where's Dad?

12:38.250 --> 12:40.875
He's taking a nap before we break fast.

12:44.333 --> 12:46.958
You don't think I've told him?

12:47.750 --> 12:50.583
He's as stubborn as you.

12:55.125 --> 12:56.125
I'm opening this.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.666
What are you doing?

12:59.500 --> 13:01.791
I told you the old one's working.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.041
That's how you greet your Dad?

14:45.083 --> 14:46.166
I was getting up.

14:46.208 --> 14:47.583
Come here, asshole.

14:49.750 --> 14:52.083
You good?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.291
You still have some life in you.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.958
Of course I do.

15:03.541 --> 15:06.208
So, you're a big deal now?

15:09.291 --> 15:11.916
I'm talking about your tour.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.666
What are you up to?

15:23.666 --> 15:26.416
Are you crazy?

15:26.458 --> 15:29.958
Vinyl cassette stores are all over Brick Lane.
We can still corner the market.

15:36.458 --> 15:38.916
Show me what you're throwing away.

15:38.958 --> 15:40.958
These are my businesses.

15:47.833 --> 15:51.416
Tell me, do people even remember
the opening act?

15:54.958 --> 15:56.083
Sure.

16:23.125 --> 16:26.041
A man was staring at a woman's chest.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.791
Yaar, Nasra. Sit down!

16:27.833 --> 16:29.458
I'm coming!

16:48.458 --> 16:49.375
That's enough.

16:55.708 --> 16:56.750
Stop it now.

18:13.750 --> 18:16.791
Once skinheads chased me from school.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.083
Look at the scar, look.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.708
I took a cricket bat once
and put up a fight.

18:24.583 --> 18:27.250
The Bengalis always ran.

18:37.416 --> 18:38.958
That's enough.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.541
That's enough now.

18:41.583 --> 18:44.166
We just broke our fast
and this is what we're talking about?

18:44.208 --> 18:46.833
Bashir, you've seen some crazy shit.

18:48.041 --> 18:50.083
Tell him how you fled India.

18:50.125 --> 18:52.708
I don't remember it.

18:52.958 --> 18:55.250
You forgot the train ride to Pakistan?

18:55.291 --> 18:57.916
The bloodshed, massacres, come on!

18:58.166 --> 19:01.875
It's not like I saved anyone.
I just hid under layers of clothes.

19:01.916 --> 19:04.666
They need to know about Partition.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.916
Leave my station alone.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.333
Sometimes they play my son's music.

19:13.666 --> 19:16.333
As if they play his music.

19:16.375 --> 19:19.125
How would you know?

19:19.166 --> 19:21.750
I like hearing my son's songs.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.666
You like gloating to the family.

19:24.708 --> 19:27.333
Someone has to.

25:30.125 --> 25:31.333
Where's Zaheer?

25:37.166 --> 25:38.416
Zaheer?

25:38.458 --> 25:41.125
What are you doing?

25:45.083 --> 25:47.166
It's opening night I need...

25:47.208 --> 25:48.583
You like rap music, right?

25:48.625 --> 25:51.416
Think of this as our rap.

25:51.458 --> 25:53.125
Come on, sweet cheeks.

25:56.375 --> 25:58.083
Do it for me.

25:58.125 --> 25:59.375
Why?

26:00.750 --> 26:03.375
Come on! Come on!

26:08.666 --> 26:10.208
This is all for you.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.166
Boy!

27:05.333 --> 27:09.166
People pay attention.

27:10.916 --> 27:13.083
They drew a line in the sand.

27:13.458 --> 27:15.708
India and Pakistan.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.125
East and West.

27:17.166 --> 27:18.375
Us and them.

27:20.458 --> 27:23.125
I was born from this rupture.

27:24.916 --> 27:33.375
And I am the sickness from this separation.

27:34.833 --> 27:37.208
I am Toba Tek Singh!

27:37.250 --> 27:39.291
I am Toba Tek Singh!

27:39.333 --> 27:41.291
Toba Tek Singh!

27:41.333 --> 27:43.208
Toba Tek Singh!

27:43.250 --> 27:45.875
Toba Tek Singh!

28:49.416 --> 28:51.416
He's up. Thank God!

28:51.458 --> 28:54.125
Bilal, tell the nurse!

28:57.250 --> 28:59.875
A nice boy found you in the alleyway.

29:00.625 --> 29:03.291
Is that what happened?

29:05.458 --> 29:07.291
How you feeling?

29:11.166 --> 29:13.500
He doesn't need his phone now.

29:20.875 --> 29:22.458
Have you warded off the evil eye?

29:22.500 --> 29:24.666
I did the peppers.

29:24.708 --> 29:25.958
Any smell?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.333
None.

29:27.375 --> 29:30.000
There's a very strong evil eye on him.

29:30.958 --> 29:32.166
Why not?

29:46.166 --> 29:48.250
Enough.

29:49.083 --> 29:51.666
Want some water, son?

33:02.875 --> 33:07.750
O asshole...
Why are you running away?

35:58.708 --> 36:00.083
Welcome home.

36:21.833 --> 36:24.416
Dad...

36:25.291 --> 36:27.291
Give us a minute, please.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.708
Feeling better?

36:47.208 --> 36:48.583
I prayed on the water.

36:50.958 --> 36:51.958
Thank you.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.583
Are you OK in there?

41:09.666 --> 41:10.750
Need help?

41:18.333 --> 41:20.250
I told you let me help you!

41:32.500 --> 41:33.708
Get up.

41:38.416 --> 41:41.083
I got you.

41:49.791 --> 41:52.416
This smell is going to make me vomit.

42:00.833 --> 42:03.000
They're bringing it.

42:03.041 --> 42:05.083
I've told them.

45:54.583 --> 45:56.000
Ridiculous.

46:02.125 --> 46:04.333
Who are we without kids?

48:41.958 --> 48:46.750
I had a friend who lost movement.

48:49.875 --> 48:53.083
He did the cupping and I saw him walk
with my own eyes.

49:40.250 --> 49:43.250
Keep this between us.

51:05.250 --> 51:07.375
Let's show these doctors.

51:08.208 --> 51:11.916
You don't need their poison to reach the lift.

52:39.625 --> 52:42.208
Zaheer, be patient.

52:43.333 --> 52:45.250
There'll be more opportunities.

56:09.833 --> 56:12.416
I filled up your water jug.

56:12.916 --> 56:15.500
The phone is here.

56:19.541 --> 56:21.166
Where shall I put your phone?

56:21.208 --> 56:26.000
- We're late to prayers.
- If you're in a rush, go!

56:26.041 --> 56:29.041
Keep it under your pillow,
in case you want to call the nurse.

56:30.208 --> 56:32.833
Call us if you need anything.

56:33.125 --> 56:34.416
We're going now.

56:35.833 --> 56:38.416
Come on!

56:39.166 --> 56:41.416
Don't go to sleep too late.

56:42.291 --> 56:45.916
Don't listen to the doctors.
This sperm freezing is nonsense.

56:45.958 --> 56:48.458
Look at him. Be more sensitive.

56:49.125 --> 56:51.541
Don't tell me how to talk to my son.

56:51.583 --> 56:54.250
<i>Be more sensitive.</i>

57:14.041 --> 57:15.916
Dad.

57:15.958 --> 57:18.541
Sometimes I see that man.

57:19.166 --> 57:22.583
The fat man with flowers on his face.

57:23.958 --> 57:26.541
Why do I see him?

57:27.250 --> 57:29.250
What does he want?

57:30.666 --> 57:31.625
<i>Son.</i>

57:32.500 --> 57:34.916
<i>Shut your face.</i>

57:36.041 --> 57:38.625
<i>It's all nonsense.</i>

57:39.041 --> 57:40.125
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

57:42.250 --> 57:44.875
But Dad,
he's trying to say something to me.

57:46.250 --> 57:47.333
Who is he?

58:34.875 --> 58:36.333
Let me help you.

58:46.208 --> 58:47.666
Just submit.

58:47.708 --> 58:50.000
Come on...

58:52.041 --> 58:53.250
Submit!

1:03:33.750 --> 1:03:35.291
Maybe one time.

1:03:38.458 --> 1:03:41.375
Yeah, legs got stiff.

1:03:43.875 --> 1:03:45.375
Mine, who else?

1:03:51.541 --> 1:03:54.208
What's the big deal?

1:03:57.166 --> 1:03:59.750
Did you know,
as you get old you go grey?

1:04:04.375 --> 1:04:06.666
You don't want to learn from me.

1:04:06.708 --> 1:04:08.625
Look at your hairy armpits.

1:04:23.375 --> 1:04:26.000
You can barely walk
and you want to go on tour?

1:04:49.375 --> 1:04:52.000
I'm trying to help you!

1:04:57.625 --> 1:05:00.291
What's going on?
We can hear you outside.

1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:02.750
What's this?

1:05:02.791 --> 1:05:05.000
It's just cupping. No big deal.

1:05:05.041 --> 1:05:07.250
Cupping? Who did this?

1:05:07.458 --> 1:05:10.375
I've got to do something.
I can't just sit on my hands.

1:05:11.125 --> 1:05:13.625
I'm always stuck cleaning up your mess.

1:05:13.666 --> 1:05:15.708
Shut up, woman! He's my son.

1:05:18.333 --> 1:05:20.416
Did the doctors give you permission?

1:05:20.458 --> 1:05:22.916
You know what the infusion will do to him?

1:05:23.875 --> 1:05:28.000
<i>What's going to happen!?
</i>Nothing ever changes!

1:05:31.541 --> 1:05:34.125
Stop shouting. It's hurting him.

1:17:34.375 --> 1:17:35.875
Get out!

1:17:47.375 --> 1:17:48.375
Get out!

1:17:52.666 --> 1:17:53.666
Get out!

1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:57.208
Get out!

1:21:47.458 --> 1:21:48.500
Just in case.

1:21:53.625 --> 1:21:56.291
Make sure to use hot water
or your balls will freeze.

1:22:07.458 --> 1:22:10.125
Nasra, turn it down. Please.

1:22:10.333 --> 1:22:12.958
Why? It's my son's new song.

1:22:59.500 --> 1:23:00.708
Then show me how.

1:23:05.416 --> 1:23:07.458
What did you say?

1:23:07.500 --> 1:23:09.375
Louder with feeling!

1:23:25.416 --> 1:23:26.458
Like this?

1:24:13.250 --> 1:24:14.666
I'll be downstairs.
