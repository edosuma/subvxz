WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:04.132
Oh, honey,
this is gonna be a great day!

00:04.204 --> 00:06.468
The steering column
showed up for the hot rod.

00:06.539 --> 00:09.702
I'll pop open the champagne.

00:09.776 --> 00:14.645
Am I ever gonna experience a wife who
savors the thrill of a new auto part?

00:14.714 --> 00:17.182
Not till you re-marry.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.243
- Hi.
- Hi, Marty. How are you doing?

00:21.321 --> 00:23.619
- Marty.
- You got the steering column!

00:23.690 --> 00:26.659
We install this today, maybe
get to the turning indicators.

00:26.726 --> 00:29.217
Great. Before we start,
can I ask you guys a favor?

00:29.295 --> 00:31.991
- Sure. What's up?
- It's our anniversary next week.

00:32.064 --> 00:34.431
Nancy and I want to weekend
at Houghton Lake.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.162
Oh, it's so romantic there.

00:36.236 --> 00:39.137
Oh, especially this time of year.
Mmm, Houghton Lake.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.470
Walking hand-in-hand across
a frozen lake, 30 below zero.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.703
Wind chill, 90 below zero.

00:44.811 --> 00:48.941
You can just admire
each other's snot-sicles.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.880
Could you get any grosser,
do you think?

00:52.952 --> 00:54.852
- Give me some time.
- All right.

00:54.921 --> 00:58.482
Mom said she'd baby-sit the twins.
But both of them's a little much.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.526
- Could you take Gracie?
- Absolutely!

01:00.593 --> 01:02.493
Great, we love having the girls here.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.122
- Hi, Uncle Marty.
- Hey, Mark.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.893
I'm going to the mall.
I'll be back soon.

01:08.468 --> 01:09.435
OK, honey.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.093
Tim?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.731
Is Mark wearing black lipstick?

01:16.810 --> 01:18.835
It goes with everything.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.995 --> 02:13.557
Look at all this cool stuff I borrowed
for my play time with Gracie.

02:13.666 --> 02:17.124
Look at all the cool stuff
I got for my play time with Brad.

02:17.203 --> 02:19.763
We're gonna put the gauges
in the dash panels today.

02:19.839 --> 02:23.297
- Oh.
- Well, Auto Boy, ready to do some work?

02:23.376 --> 02:27.142
Something came up. I talked to Samantha,
I'm gonna go meet her at the mall.

02:28.214 --> 02:29.738
What about the dash panels?

02:29.816 --> 02:34.480
Well, let me see, a beautiful blonde
goddess who loves me, or dash panels?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.250
And gauges.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.624
<i>Adios.</i>

02:43.863 --> 02:47.390
What's that all about? He promised
to help work on the car, and he bails?

02:47.467 --> 02:50.766
Oh, Tim, when you were his age,
which did you want to be with?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.600
A girl, or...

02:52.672 --> 02:54.799
Oh, never mind.

02:55.475 --> 02:58.842
- Hey, Gracie.
- Just in time. How are you doing, man?

02:58.945 --> 03:02.608
Here she is. Here's the guest of honor
and some of her stuff.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.910
Hey, sweetie. Ready to spend
the weekend with me and Uncle Tim?

03:09.155 --> 03:11.988
I think so.

03:12.058 --> 03:15.152
OK, here's her stuff.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.991
- Here's emergency numbers.
- OK.

03:17.096 --> 03:19.724
- Here's the rundown. No candy.
- No candy.

03:19.799 --> 03:23.235
No soft drinks. No bedtime stories
until she's brushed her teeth.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.271
- Honey, are you getting this?
- I got it.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.807
<i>And don't let her watch
any more Tool Time.</i>

03:28.875 --> 03:30.900
It gives her nightmares.

03:31.578 --> 03:33.512
Me, too.

03:34.948 --> 03:38.111
Nap between 2:00 and 4:00, don't let her
sleep more than two hours

03:38.184 --> 03:40.448
- or she'll keep you up.
- I got it under control.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.216
I've got all these
fun activities planned for us.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.780
We're gonna have a tea party,
play dress-up.

03:45.858 --> 03:48.520
Dress-up? That'll be so much fun

03:48.595 --> 03:51.962
'cause I've got this darling
off-the-shoulder number to die for.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.799
- Have a great time up at the lake.
- OK, thanks.

03:55.868 --> 03:57.335
OK, honey.

03:57.403 --> 04:01.305
I'll see you in two sleeps. Be a good
girl for your Aunt Tim and Uncle Jill.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.401
I think he means
Uncle Tim and Aunt Jill.

04:06.479 --> 04:09.846
Oh, right. I was thinking of you
playing dress-up.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.317
These suitcases are so heavy.
Do you have rocks in here?

04:17.390 --> 04:19.415
Yes.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.619
- I'll take her stuff upstairs.
- OK.

04:21.694 --> 04:24.458
So, do you want to introduce me
to your animal friends?

04:24.564 --> 04:26.657
No. They're shy.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.759
That explains why they're so quiet.

04:30.169 --> 04:33.070
Excuse me, honey... just a second.

04:34.807 --> 04:38.573
<i>Hello? Oh, hi, Dr. Ashley.</i>

04:41.080 --> 04:44.982
Yes. Actually, I did sort of have plans.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.952
Yeah. Well, OK. I'll see what I can do.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.182
All right. Bye. Tim!

04:50.256 --> 04:52.190
Jill!

04:53.459 --> 04:57.793
One of the therapists
didn't show up for her group at 11:00.

04:57.864 --> 05:00.958
- Can you cover for me?
- I've never done therapy before.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.797
But how hard can it be?

05:04.837 --> 05:07.704
I mean, can you cover
for me with Gracie?

05:07.774 --> 05:09.537
By myself?

05:09.642 --> 05:11.075
Tim, you raised three kids.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.875
I raised three boys. This is a girl.
I don't know about girls.

05:14.947 --> 05:18.849
Everything is the same as with boys.
You read to them. You feed them.

05:18.918 --> 05:23.082
- Is she potty trained?
- She's four years old.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.557
Well, Marty wasrt potty trained
until he was, like, nine.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.624
And I still think
he's wearing something at night.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.725
Thank you.

05:34.567 --> 05:38.731
No. Leave the girl
alone. Give me my bamboo. My bamboo.

05:38.805 --> 05:44.107
Oh, Mr. Panda, thank you so much
from saving me from Mr. Monkey.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.010
Oh, don't thank me. Thank Mr. Tiger.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.913
That's Mr. Lion Cub.

05:49.982 --> 05:52.007
Sorry. I've never been
a lion cub before.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.349
Well, I have.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.723
You know, I gotta tell you,
it's a tough gig.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.521
Everyone expects you to be king.

06:01.594 --> 06:04.290
- Hi, Randy.
- Hi, Gracie.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.491
Cousin Randy, you play
with Cousin Gracie,

06:06.566 --> 06:08.864
so Uncle Tim can go play
with Mr. Hot Rod?

06:08.935 --> 06:11.904
Well, uh, Cousin Randy would love to,

06:12.004 --> 06:16.304
but I gotta spend a couple hours with
Uncle Chemistry and Aunt Algebra.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.537
- See you later.
- OK.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.040
What do you want to do now,
Uncle Tim?

06:22.148 --> 06:24.776
Hmm. Hey, I got an idea!

06:24.851 --> 06:27.718
Why don't we ask Mr. Gorilla
what he wants to do?

06:27.787 --> 06:29.118
OK.

06:31.758 --> 06:34.386
No! Really?

06:34.460 --> 06:37.918
- Mr. Gorilla wants to play hot rod.
- He does?

06:39.298 --> 06:41.323
Tell her.
Love the hot rod.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.336
Love the hot rod.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.935
Now, this is what Uncle Tim
likes to play with.

06:49.008 --> 06:52.967
- Cool.
- That's right. '46 Ford convertible.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.707
- Wow!
- Wow is right.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.410
I've got it lowered,
independent rear suspension.

06:58.484 --> 07:01.248
Motor City Flathead
in Ypsilanti built me the motor.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.880
- Neat!
- Yeah! Look at this.

07:03.956 --> 07:07.119
It's a convertible. So we can
sit in here. It might start to rain.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.786
I suppose a girl like you
would like to put the top up?

07:09.862 --> 07:12.126
- Yeah.
- This button right here, flip it up.

07:14.867 --> 07:19.167
Hey, now I got an idea!

07:19.238 --> 07:21.934
You and Mr. Gorilla go by
the workbench, hand me tools,

07:22.008 --> 07:23.373
I'll finish the dash panel?

07:23.476 --> 07:26.775
- Let me ask Mr. Gorilla.
- Don't.

07:26.846 --> 07:29.940
He wants to have a tea party.

07:36.522 --> 07:40.185
I'll be the princess
and you be the queen.

07:40.259 --> 07:42.750
You want me to be the queen?

07:44.797 --> 07:46.128
OK...

07:46.199 --> 07:49.726
...but if I take you to the hardware
store, this never happened, OK?

07:50.069 --> 07:52.162
Here's your crown.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.138
My crown, huh?

08:07.720 --> 08:10.587
All right, Princess Gracie,

08:10.656 --> 08:14.148
we'll have ourselves a spot of tea.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.695
It's very hot.
Now, don't burn yourself.

08:16.762 --> 08:20.721
After our tea, maybe we'll take the
Corgis out for a walk and a wee-wee.

08:22.668 --> 08:26.195
Princess Gracie, is there something
you'd like to eat with your tea?

08:26.272 --> 08:27.705
A cookie.

08:27.773 --> 08:31.106
You want a cookie?
We only have muffins. Hold on a minute.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.839
Squire, the good princess
wants a cookie!

08:37.984 --> 08:42.546
Now, what would
Her Royal Figidness like to have?

08:42.621 --> 08:44.920
How about a lobotomy?

08:47.293 --> 08:51.252
Well, look who's here.
It's the village idiot.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.830
Off with his head!
Now go! Run! Get his head! Go! Go!

08:56.903 --> 08:58.029
Run!

08:59.906 --> 09:03.398
"'Rabbit, let's bounce together.'
Rabbit couldn't believe his ears.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.171
'Me, bounce? ' he said.

09:05.244 --> 09:08.509
'Well, sure,' said Tigger.
'You got the feet for it."'

09:09.448 --> 09:13.282
I wouldn't call those "feet."
I would've called those "gunboats."

09:13.352 --> 09:15.877
Those are big feet.
No wonder he can bounce them.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.719
I mean, these feet are gigantic.
These are...

09:20.560 --> 09:23.620
Looks like somebody else
lost their bounce, huh?

09:23.696 --> 09:26.062
Let's lie down.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.388
Tim?

09:57.096 --> 09:58.757
Where are you?

09:58.831 --> 10:00.264
Tim?

10:00.733 --> 10:03.497
Oh, adorable...

10:08.474 --> 10:10.339
Was I drooling?

10:12.378 --> 10:16.337
No. You just fell asleep
with Gracie. She looks so sweet.

10:16.415 --> 10:19.578
Well, she may look sweet,

10:19.685 --> 10:23.451
but don't play Candyland with her.

10:23.522 --> 10:25.547
She marks her cards.

10:27.159 --> 10:30.322
So, how'd it go?

10:30.429 --> 10:35.059
Well, we had a tea party, played with
the stuffed animals, read some books.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.227
It was one of the best
afternoons of my life.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.965
- Oh, yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

10:40.039 --> 10:42.132
She's really cool, you know?

10:42.208 --> 10:46.110
She's different than the boys. They want
to roughhouse. She has stories to tell.

10:46.178 --> 10:48.009
She even liked my Queen Mum.

10:49.448 --> 10:52.008
I'm glad you had
a good afternoon together.

10:52.084 --> 10:54.712
- We had a great afternoon.
- All right.

10:54.787 --> 10:58.746
I started thinking about what we missed
by not having a daughter.

11:00.526 --> 11:04.155
This from the man who used a magnifying
glass on every one of my sonograms,

11:04.230 --> 11:06.790
praying for a prenatal winkie?

11:10.536 --> 11:13.300
Well, that was then, you know.
This is now.

11:13.406 --> 11:17.103
It just took me a little while to
figure out how cool little girls were.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.872
- I like this new side of you.
- Yeah?

11:19.945 --> 11:21.776
- Yeah, it's sweet.
- Really?

11:21.847 --> 11:25.544
- Yeah. It's kinda sexy.
- Hold that thought.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.280
- There's something I've been thinking.
- Mmm, yeah?

11:28.354 --> 11:29.719
Let's have a daughter.

11:36.228 --> 11:38.287
Excuse me. Did you...

11:38.364 --> 11:40.389
Did you say "daughter?"

11:40.466 --> 11:42.491
I say let's be open to the possibility.

11:42.568 --> 11:46.129
There is no possibility.
You had a vasectomy.

11:48.340 --> 11:50.706
They can be reversed.

11:50.776 --> 11:53.506
Or better yet,

11:53.579 --> 11:55.604
what if we had sex every day?

11:57.783 --> 11:59.751
If we had sex every day,

11:59.852 --> 12:03.515
then maybe one of my little guys who's
been hiding is ready to make his move.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.820
Tim, you obviously haven't
thought this through.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.865
- I want us to think it through.
- OK. OK, we will. All right.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.902
- Suppose one of these guys...
- Let's call him, uh, "Bob."

12:18.003 --> 12:20.130
What is gonna guarantee that "Bob"

12:20.206 --> 12:23.698
- is gonna get us a girl?
- Bob won't let us down.

12:26.545 --> 12:29.207
Bob let us down three times!

12:29.281 --> 12:32.250
That wasrt Bob. That was Steve.

12:34.587 --> 12:38.023
And... And if we want to make sure,
we... we could adopt.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.650
Tim... Tim, just listen to yourself.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.526
You spend one afternoon with a niece
and all of a sudden you want a baby?

12:44.630 --> 12:47.326
- Because I thought it would be fun.
- Fun?

12:47.399 --> 12:50.163
Fun, we'd build a room to keep her.

12:50.236 --> 12:51.965
Think.

12:53.939 --> 12:57.204
This is a child, not a Corvette.

12:58.077 --> 13:00.739
Yeah. But I wouldn't love her any less,
I tell you that.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.947
All those years ago when we decided
not to have any other children,

13:07.019 --> 13:09.749
I re-routed my whole life.
You know, I have a career now.

13:09.822 --> 13:12.655
- Maybe we can work around that.
- Honey...

13:12.725 --> 13:14.693
...a child is a lifelong commitment.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.354
I don't want to work around a child.

13:17.429 --> 13:19.454
Are you shutting the door on this?

13:19.532 --> 13:22.194
I think it is so great...

13:22.268 --> 13:25.931
...that you're having
all these feelings.

13:26.005 --> 13:28.166
I just don't really want another child.

13:28.274 --> 13:31.732
I think if you think about it for
a while, you're gonna feel the same way.

13:33.579 --> 13:36.639
Well, I can speak for me,
but I can't speak for Bob.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.388
Welcome back to Hobby Week.

13:44.156 --> 13:48.252
Yesterday we showed you how to build
this doll house I built for my nieces.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.352
And today the focus is on furniture.

13:50.429 --> 13:54.092
That's right. And to build
tiny furniture, you need a tiny tool.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.225
Who knows
more about a tiny tool?

13:56.302 --> 13:58.270
Tim.

13:58.704 --> 14:02.196
Well, I used a Binford 61
miniature scroll saw

14:02.274 --> 14:04.174
to cut the pieces for my little table.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.711
We modeled it in the Chippendale style.

14:06.779 --> 14:10.044
Actually, at this size,
it would be perfect for Chip 'r Dale.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.789
Well, Heidi and I used
the Binford 61 miniature lathe

14:17.890 --> 14:20.552
to shape the post for our canopy bed.

14:20.626 --> 14:24.153
When using small tools, it's a great
idea to use magnifying glasses

14:24.230 --> 14:25.925
so you can see what you're doing.

14:29.568 --> 14:32.867
I can actually see the cameramars
brain from here.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.666
While these guys finish the posts,

14:35.741 --> 14:37.868
I'm gonna use more glue
on my table top here.

14:37.943 --> 14:41.106
Now, the great thing
about these microtools

14:41.213 --> 14:46.173
is that they allow you to shape
your posts almost effortlessly.

14:47.386 --> 14:51.345
All right, Heidi, why don't you finish
that up while we, uh, check in with Tim.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.823
- Tim, you OK?
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.121
- Where's the dining-room table?
- Here.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.529
All right. Now... Well, let go.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.972
Wait. What happened to all those chairs?

15:18.450 --> 15:20.975
We'll be right back after
these words from Binford.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.990
Hey, guys.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.528
<i>Did, um, any of you see
Tool Time today?</i>

15:30.596 --> 15:32.757
Unfortunately, yes.

15:33.799 --> 15:35.323
Dad's lost it.

15:35.401 --> 15:38.029
<i>Yeah, it was his second
girlie Tool Time in a row.</i>

15:38.103 --> 15:41.129
What's next, a Pantyhose Week?

15:41.206 --> 15:43.106
Or a "Salute to Feminine Hygiene"?

15:44.310 --> 15:46.437
I don't know about you,
but I stop watching

15:46.512 --> 15:48.810
the day Dad turns to Al and says,

15:48.881 --> 15:51.008
"Do you feel fresh?"

15:55.287 --> 15:56.914
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

15:56.989 --> 16:00.948
Hey, Dad. So, how many more shows
are you planning on doing about dolls?

16:01.060 --> 16:02.687
Oh, two.

16:02.761 --> 16:06.629
Doll Patio Furniture and
The Best of Hot Rod Barbie, huh?

16:09.068 --> 16:11.229
Guys, guys, just go wash up for dinner.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.464
What's with them?

16:13.572 --> 16:15.506
I can't believe you're still on this.

16:15.574 --> 16:19.203
You know, you gotta get a grip. You're
obsessed with this daughter stuff.

16:19.278 --> 16:22.714
You know, that's what the lady
at the adoption agency said.

16:23.849 --> 16:25.908
I should be open to a boy.

16:25.985 --> 16:29.546
But then I explained about
the boys we have, she understood.

16:29.621 --> 16:32.089
You went to an adoption agency?

16:32.157 --> 16:35.718
No, no. I just called a few on my lunch
hour. I wouldn't do that without you.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.764
Well, that's good because I don't
want to go to an adoption agency.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.561
I don't want to have another child.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.897
If you need time to think,
take all the time you want.

16:43.969 --> 16:46.096
OK... no.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.732
And I want you to take this "no"
seriously this time.

16:52.845 --> 16:57.145
If I took it seriously every time you
said no, we wouldn't have any kids.

17:02.454 --> 17:04.285
Is everything all right over there?

17:04.356 --> 17:06.790
Oh. Hey, Tim. How's it going, bro?

17:06.858 --> 17:09.191
Hi, Willow.
What's with the fire?

17:09.261 --> 17:12.890
Uncle Wilson built this
for some sacred Hindu ritual.

17:12.964 --> 17:15.729
But I'm using it to dry my nail polish.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.894
This color's called Back to the Fuchsia.

17:19.003 --> 17:22.098
When you little girls
paint your nails, you're so cute.

17:22.174 --> 17:26.611
I'm 26 and I got a fungus under my
thumbnail like you wouldn't believe.

17:26.678 --> 17:28.908
You were probably cute
when you were little.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.848
Yeah. But then there was
that awkward period

17:31.917 --> 17:34.249
between three and twenty-five.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.824
Speaking of periods,
I'm starting to bloat...

17:39.892 --> 17:42.622
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wilson!

17:43.395 --> 17:45.363
Willow, Vince is on the phone.

17:45.431 --> 17:48.195
He wants to stop by
after he visits his parole officer.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.201
- Cool.
- Parole officer?

17:51.270 --> 17:53.636
Well, this boyfriend's
better than the last one.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.764
At least he's out.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.577
This is great, though.
You get to spend time with your niece.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.545
I get to spend time with mine.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.774
She's making me
want to have a daughter.

18:06.618 --> 18:09.280
I thought in your case,
that was no longer an option.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.786
Well, you can reverse a vasectomy.

18:12.858 --> 18:15.952
- Well, what about Jill?
- She's not reversible.

18:18.497 --> 18:22.957
Are you serious about having another
child at this point in your life?

18:23.035 --> 18:25.526
I don't know what's come over me.
I really don't.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.505
Everything changed the moment
I spent time with Gracie.

18:28.574 --> 18:31.338
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Instead of wanting to play G.I. Joes

18:31.443 --> 18:34.412
and cap guns, I feel like
making cute things, you know?

18:34.480 --> 18:36.846
We had a...
We had a tea party.

18:36.915 --> 18:39.543
A tea party, you say?
Delightful!

18:39.618 --> 18:41.779
Quite, quite.
Yes, it was.

18:44.089 --> 18:47.616
- I used to think boys were the ticket!
- Right.

18:47.693 --> 18:51.595
But, boy, Gracie's so different. She's
got such an imagination, you know?

18:51.663 --> 18:53.824
She brought out the queen in me.

18:53.932 --> 18:57.265
No, no, no, no... That's a whole other
direction right there. Whoa!

18:58.804 --> 19:02.501
I don't know why this is. You know,
I spend a lot of time with my nieces.

19:02.574 --> 19:05.839
- Maybe it's because they're older.
- Maybe it's you getting older.

19:05.911 --> 19:09.438
You know, in the words
of Oliver Wendell Holmes,

19:09.515 --> 19:11.949
"Men are like peaches and pears.

19:12.017 --> 19:15.509
They grow sweet a little while
before they begin to decay."

19:18.190 --> 19:19.953
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.925
So, you're saying
I'll get soggy before I rot.

19:25.564 --> 19:30.126
No. I'm saying you're able to appreciate
a side of life you never could before.

19:30.235 --> 19:33.170
But what about this idea
about me having a daughter?

19:33.238 --> 19:36.071
Well, Tim, if you like
to build cute things

19:36.141 --> 19:39.872
and you like to have tea parties, you
can always have them with your nieces.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.435
Maybe you're right.

19:41.513 --> 19:45.279
And that way I can avoid that
unpleasant diaper-changing phase.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.113
Zero to eight.

19:52.758 --> 19:56.194
- I want to talk about something.
- I'm afraid to ask. What about?

19:56.261 --> 19:59.788
I want to talk about what Sherlock
Wendell Holmes said, all right?

20:01.133 --> 20:05.502
The reason men want daughters is
because they're like rotten peaches.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.873
I should just play with my pears.

20:13.078 --> 20:14.978
It would be better for all concerned

20:15.047 --> 20:17.880
if you didn't father any more children.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.418
I don't have to.
When I miss having a daughter,

20:20.485 --> 20:22.453
I can spend time
with Gracie and Claire.

20:22.521 --> 20:23.886
Well, that's a great idea!

20:23.989 --> 20:28.153
When our kids grow up, are married,
maybe they'll crank out a couple chicks.

20:28.760 --> 20:32.196
Well, I hope they do some
of that "cranking."

20:32.264 --> 20:34.755
I sure would like to have
some granddaughters.

20:34.833 --> 20:38.200
Grandparents have the best of all
worlds. They can play with the kid,

20:38.303 --> 20:42.034
- when trouble starts...
- Pass that kid right off to the parent

20:42.107 --> 20:45.270
and bolt for the Early Bird Special
at the IHOP.

20:45.444 --> 20:48.174
Well, we're a long way
from being grandparents.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.944
I'm glad. Because it gives me
more time to play with you.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.484
Oh, yeah. Big girls are fun.

20:53.552 --> 20:54.917
Mm-hmm.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.948
What's that Bob doing tonight?

20:58.023 --> 21:00.253
He's all tied up.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.631
All right. The fuse panel's in place.
Marty, hand me the sockets.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.133
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.937
OK. Perfect.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.632
OK, girls.

21:14.706 --> 21:18.472
I've tightened down
the fuse panel.

21:18.543 --> 21:21.808
And now, how would you guys
like to watch

21:21.880 --> 21:25.043
Uncle Tim and your dad
wire the car from scratch?

21:36.094 --> 21:38.221
We should also ask this guy, though.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.062
I am Buzz Lightyear.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.906
No, I am Buzz Lightyear.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.938
No, I am Buzz Lightyear.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.347
No, I come in peace.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.809
<i>I come in peace.</i>

21:59.384 --> 22:00.715
No, I come in peace.
