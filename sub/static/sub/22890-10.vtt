09:02.467 --> 09:04.667
Nice to meet you.
- Dr. Julia Turetskaya.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.734
Come on in.
- Sure.

09:06.734 --> 09:08.300
Whoo.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.600
- Please, make yourself
comfortable.

09:10.600 --> 09:15.066
- I think seeing a therapist
for me is long overdue.

09:15.066 --> 09:16.734
- When I know that you're
in a funk,

09:16.734 --> 09:18.266
I just wanna help.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.166
- Well, I'm starting therapy.

09:20.166 --> 09:24.200
I don't wanna be somebody whose
thoughts and feelings

09:24.200 --> 09:26.000
are affecting other people
around me.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.734
- I think this is a step
in the right direction.

09:28.734 --> 09:32.133
- I just feel like I could be
doing more to help myself,

09:32.133 --> 09:33.734
and get my head right.

09:33.734 --> 09:37.734
I've always been a very
self-critical person.

09:37.734 --> 09:41.100
If I'm wearing shorts
or a bathing suit,

09:41.100 --> 09:43.233
I have make up
on my entire body.

09:43.233 --> 09:47.233
And then I feel like over
the last few years

09:47.233 --> 09:49.367
it's just--amplifies.

09:49.367 --> 09:52.433
My ex-boyfriend was
another amplification

09:52.433 --> 09:54.066
of my self-criticism.

09:54.066 --> 09:56.467
So that criticism then was,
like,

09:56.467 --> 09:59.033
I'm already criticizing myself,
and then the person I'm with

09:59.033 --> 10:02.233
is doing that on, like,
a scale that's, like,

10:02.233 --> 10:04.066
not okay.

10:04.066 --> 10:06.567
My ex-boyfriend was like,
"You should go to the doctor.

10:06.567 --> 10:08.233
There's something
wrong with you."

10:09.567 --> 10:13.100
For, like,
normal vaginal functions.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.767
He obviously never took, like,
a sex ed class.

10:15.767 --> 10:17.633
- That relationship, if you
wouldn't mind telling me

10:17.633 --> 10:19.567
a little bit more.
- There was something about it

10:19.567 --> 10:22.667
right then in the beginning
that I thought,

10:22.667 --> 10:24.600
"This is, like, a fling."

10:24.600 --> 10:28.000
But then this person said,
"I want you to stay with me."

10:28.000 --> 10:29.467
Then of course I didn't
have any money,

10:29.467 --> 10:31.333
and he was paying for things,

10:31.333 --> 10:34.667
and he was letting me stay
there, which was a nice thing.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.000
But then it was being held
over my head.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.200
There were a lot of, like,
scary text messages

10:39.200 --> 10:41.066
and yelling and things
like that.

10:41.066 --> 10:43.066
That's the only time
I've ever experienced

10:43.066 --> 10:44.400
something like that.

10:44.400 --> 10:47.400
And it was...
Yeah.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.667
- Okay.
Not great.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.400
- Okay.
- Yeah, not good.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
- Do you feel like you have
a good support system?

10:52.400 --> 10:54.467
People you trust in your life,
people you can talk to

10:54.467 --> 10:56.266
if you're having a hard day?

10:56.266 --> 11:00.066
- I do--well, my boyfriend
is a really good support.

11:00.066 --> 11:03.734
Yes, I see him as
my romantic partner,

11:03.734 --> 11:06.100
my friend,
and also, like,

11:06.100 --> 11:08.100
a partner in life and business
and things like that.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.500
- Wonderful.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.433
Does that future involve
marriage or a family?

11:12.433 --> 11:14.033
Tell me a little
bit about that.

11:14.033 --> 11:16.500
- Um, I really do not want
to give birth.

11:16.500 --> 11:21.033
That to me is--
oh, my God, no, thank you.

11:21.033 --> 11:22.567
- What about that
seems so scary?

11:22.567 --> 11:23.767
Like, the idea of giving birth?

11:23.767 --> 11:26.700
- Um, oh, God.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.433
Everything.

11:28.433 --> 11:30.266
Sometimes I'll show Tom, like,
those gross things

11:30.266 --> 11:32.233
and I'll be like--like,
you really wanna sit there

11:32.233 --> 11:34.700
and watch, like,
all this ----ing...

11:34.700 --> 11:37.166
Like, gross sh--

11:37.166 --> 11:39.433
come out of my vagina?
You really want that?

11:39.433 --> 11:41.567
Oh, I can't even--

11:41.567 --> 11:43.567
- Coming to therapy,
what are some of your goals?

11:43.567 --> 11:45.066
What do you want to get
out of this?

11:45.066 --> 11:47.400
- I wanna be able to...

11:47.400 --> 11:52.533
Wear something or be naked
in front of my boyfriend

11:52.533 --> 11:57.333
or whatever and not have so
much anxiety about it.

11:57.333 --> 12:01.266
It's hard because I wanna be
really good at communicating

12:01.266 --> 12:03.433
those things with Tom,
but I don't want Tom to think

12:03.433 --> 12:06.467
that I feel this way because
I'm not attracted to him.

12:06.467 --> 12:08.533
- And there's things we would
never say to our friends,

12:08.533 --> 12:10.400
to our loved ones,
but we're so mean to ourselves.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.066
- Mm-hmm.
- And that's gonna be

12:12.066 --> 12:13.734
part of our therapy,
for you to catch yourself

12:13.734 --> 12:15.700
having any of those thoughts,
if that happens.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.600
How do we cope with it?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.066
How do you start riding
the wave as opposed to drowning

12:20.066 --> 12:22.400
or trying to fight it
or run away from it.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.066
- I'm just frozen.
- Yeah.

12:24.066 --> 12:25.400
Yeah, exactly.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.233

everything that we're doing

12:56.333 --> 12:58.033

12:58.033 --> 12:59.233
I hope that there's gonna be
a lot of people

12:59.233 --> 13:01.300
and as many as last year.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.767
World Dog Day last year
was a huge success.

13:03.767 --> 13:06.367
- Oh, that's so sweet of you.
Thank you.

13:06.367 --> 13:07.500
- You guys wanna
buy raffle tickets?

13:07.500 --> 13:09.200
They're a dollar a piece.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.500
And it goes to the
Vanderpump Pet Foundation.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.467
- We wanted to have a festival
where we celebrated dogs

13:14.467 --> 13:19.133
that was diametrically opposed
to the Yulin Dog Meat Festival.

13:19.133 --> 13:22.133
I've got T-shirts,
so just wear jeans,

13:22.133 --> 13:23.667
whatever, Lala, you'd like.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.266
A church outfit for you,
darling.

13:25.266 --> 13:26.667
- Yes.
- You can do whatever

13:26.667 --> 13:28.333
you want with it,
but wear it, okay?

13:28.333 --> 13:30.200
- James, for tomorrow--
- Yeah.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.000
- You can play some of the
kitsch songs as well.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.533
You know, like, "How Much is
That Doggy in--"

13:34.533 --> 13:36.233
Whatever, you know?
- Oh, okay.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.467
World Dog Day is not
the most, you know,

13:38.467 --> 13:40.767
extravagant, exciting gig
I've ever had.

13:40.767 --> 13:44.333
Will the owner of a Toyota
please head to the DJ booth?

13:44.333 --> 13:45.667
I found your keys.

13:45.667 --> 13:47.600
It's got a Mickey Mouse
key on it.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.400
You know,
on the road to success,

13:49.400 --> 13:51.033
you gotta pay your dues.

13:51.033 --> 13:53.033
- And when everybody comes in,
you know,

13:53.033 --> 13:55.166
through the balloon arches,

13:55.166 --> 13:56.300
we ask them for a donation.

13:57.700 --> 14:00.033
- You can say that you'll
make out with them

14:00.033 --> 14:02.300
if they give you, like,
50 cents.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.166
- And you'll forget
about it afterwards.

14:04.166 --> 14:06.300
- Because that's always, like,
your charitable donation,

14:06.300 --> 14:07.567
right?

14:07.567 --> 14:09.166
Right?
- With Katie's permission,

14:09.166 --> 14:10.533
we'll talk about it.
- Okay, all right.

14:10.533 --> 14:13.300
- Yeah, yeah.
- So Stassi and Ariana,

14:13.300 --> 14:15.033
they're having
separate parties.

14:15.033 --> 14:16.633
- Tonight they are, yeah.

14:16.633 --> 14:18.700
Either one of you guys gonna
come to the parties?

14:18.700 --> 14:20.433
Either one?
- No.

14:20.433 --> 14:23.100
I cannot be running around
on a Saturday night

14:23.100 --> 14:25.033
when we've got businesses...
- Yeah.

14:25.033 --> 14:28.033
To look after, and I've got 300
staff going to each

14:28.033 --> 14:29.567
of your birthday parties.

14:29.567 --> 14:31.133
- Lisa, if you came
to Ariana's,

14:31.133 --> 14:33.066
you wouldn't even have
to dress up,

14:33.066 --> 14:35.266
being the queen that you are
and Ken the king that you are.

14:35.266 --> 14:36.600
- King and queen!

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
- Schwartz,
you're full of sh--.

14:39.066 --> 14:40.333
- Okay, Brittany,
stay here a second.

14:40.333 --> 14:41.734
I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

14:41.734 --> 14:43.133
- All right, see you in the
morning, Lisa.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.533
- Okay.
- Yeah, baby.

14:44.533 --> 14:48.133
- Bye, Lisa.
-So I wanted to talk to you

14:48.133 --> 14:51.567
about Jax and what happened
the other night.

14:51.567 --> 14:53.433
People are late all the time,

14:53.433 --> 14:55.533
but it was about
his attitude as well.

14:55.533 --> 14:57.066
- Yeah,
I agree with that 100%,

14:57.066 --> 14:58.467
'cause whenever he
told me about it,

14:58.467 --> 15:01.066
he kinda just acted like
when he talked to you

15:01.066 --> 15:02.266
that it wasn't a big deal.

15:02.266 --> 15:03.667
And that really
hurt my feelings,

15:03.667 --> 15:05.400
because I knew it's such
a big deal to you,

15:05.400 --> 15:07.266
and you've done
so much for him.

15:07.266 --> 15:09.433
- At times he's
been challenging,

15:09.433 --> 15:10.533
to say the least.

15:10.533 --> 15:12.000
And I don't appreciate that,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.700
and I don't want
him there tomorrow.

15:13.700 --> 15:16.033
Well, there's so many factors
why I don't want Jax Taylor

15:16.033 --> 15:17.100
at World Dog Day.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.066
I'm pissed off with him.

15:19.066 --> 15:22.033
I want to punish him because I
know he would like to be there.

15:22.033 --> 15:24.367
And he's irritated the
out of me.

15:24.367 --> 15:26.166
I don't care what he does.

something wrong with me.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.233

- I don't think there's
anything wrong with you,

16:49.100 --> 16:52.233
but when we first
started dating,

16:52.233 --> 16:56.100
we were having sex, like,
multiple times a week.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.567
When we took our first trip,

16:57.567 --> 16:59.700
we had sex literally
every night we were there.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.367
- Mm-hmm.

17:01.367 --> 17:05.300
And I know obviously
the newness wears off, but--

17:05.300 --> 17:07.700
- Well, the other thing that
wears off is the, like,

17:07.700 --> 17:09.233
confidence.

17:09.233 --> 17:11.567
Confidence is, like,
partially an act.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.633
Like, it's new and it's fun,
and it's, you know,

17:15.633 --> 17:17.367
we're, like, falling in love
with each other.

17:17.367 --> 17:18.700

17:18.700 --> 17:20.200
There's no playing pretend.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.667
There's no pretending
to be confident.

17:21.667 --> 17:23.266
So if I feel it, I feel it.

there's no faking it.

17:25.533 --> 17:27.433
You know what I'm saying?

17:27.433 --> 17:30.000
- Yeah, but I think you felt it
a lot more back then.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.600
I mean, let's be real.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.467
Like, when you're with somebody
for a few years,

17:34.467 --> 17:36.467
of course, like,
the excitement dies down

17:36.467 --> 17:38.266
a little bit.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.066
But I feel like she's, like,
