that what teller's written down
here is a guess, and we are

09:15.656 --> 09:18.723

hoping very much that he's

09:18.725 --> 09:20.225

10:44.377 --> 10:46.678
>> My name is Nick einhorn.
I've been performing magic

10:46.680 --> 10:48.146
I've been performing magic
professionally for the last 16

10:48.148 --> 10:49.314
professionally for the last 16
years.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.315
Years.
Ten years ago, I was asked to

10:50.317 --> 10:51.650
ten years ago, I was asked to
write a magic book for the

10:51.652 --> 10:52.317
write a magic book for the
public.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.218
Public.
Since then, we've written a

10:53.219 --> 10:54.118
since then, we've written a
selection of books, which

10:54.121 --> 10:56.087
selection of books, which
luckily for me have sold over

10:56.089 --> 10:57.989
luckily for me have sold over
500,000 copies all over the

500,000 copies all over the
world.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.192
World.
What I love about magic is that

11:01.194 --> 11:02.727
what I love about magic is that
moment of wonder that you can

11:02.729 --> 11:04.229
moment of wonder that you can
give to people and just make

11:04.231 --> 11:05.730
give to people and just make
them concentrate on something,

11:05.732 --> 11:07.098
them concentrate on something,
which hopefully is so magical

11:07.100 --> 11:11.403
which hopefully is so magical
that it just blows their mind.

11:11.405 --> 11:12.404
That it just blows their mind.
There's no specific area in

11:12.406 --> 11:13.672
there's no specific area in
which I specialize.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.407
Which I specialize.
It's kind of a

11:15.409 --> 11:17.709
it's kind of a
Jack-of-all-trades, master of

11:17.711 --> 11:18.176
Jack-of-all-trades, master of
none.

11:18.178 --> 11:18.760
None.
That's no good, is it?

11:18.761 --> 11:19.343
That's no good, is it?
No.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.879
No.

>> Thank you.
Thank you very much.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.696
Thank you very much.
Recent research has suggested

11:37.698 --> 11:39.397
recent research has suggested
that under pressure, women make

11:39.399 --> 11:40.965
that under pressure, women make
better decisions than men.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.067
Better decisions than men.
Well, this evening, I'm gonna

11:42.069 --> 11:43.368
well, this evening, I'm gonna
put the power of a woman's

11:43.370 --> 11:44.436
put the power of a woman's
intuition to the test.

11:44.438 --> 11:45.937
Intuition to the test.
I'm gonna do that by choosing a

11:45.939 --> 11:47.238
I'm gonna do that by choosing a
woman completely at random from

11:47.240 --> 11:49.774
woman completely at random from
tonight's audience, and there's

11:49.776 --> 11:50.842
tonight's audience, and there's
a lady just here.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.210
A lady just here.

11:53.714 --> 11:54.412

to me.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.147
To me.
Could you stand up for us?

11:56.149 --> 11:57.382
Could you stand up for us?
I'm gonna ask you a couple of

11:57.384 --> 11:58.717
I'm gonna ask you a couple of
questions, and I want you to

11:58.719 --> 11:59.284
questions, and I want you to
answer these questions

11:59.286 --> 12:01.820

impulsively, and if your

12:01.822 --> 12:03.822
impulsively, and if your
instinct is right, and what

12:03.824 --> 12:04.789
instinct is right, and what
we're about to do tonight, while

12:04.791 --> 12:06.424
we're about to do tonight, while
it's not impossible, will be

12:06.426 --> 12:08.259
it's not impossible, will be
highly improbable.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.127
Highly improbable.
Okay?

12:09.129 --> 12:10.762
Okay?

My favorite dishes.
Behind me here are three tables.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.873
Behind me here are three tables.
Your first task is to decide

12:21.875 --> 12:23.374
your first task is to decide
which table to serve which dish

12:23.376 --> 12:24.109

[Laughter]
Okay, do you think Wayne looks

14:23.897 --> 14:24.929
okay, do you think Wayne looks
like a man who should be sitting

14:24.931 --> 14:27.265
like a man who should be sitting
at table one, two, or three?

14:27.267 --> 14:28.132
At table one, two, or three?
>> Two.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.033

Go to table number one.
You have the longest to walk.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.242
You have the longest to walk.
Thank you very much.

14:37.244 --> 14:37.926
Thank you very much.
Now, before they get too

14:37.927 --> 14:38.609
now, before they get too
comfortable, do you want to

14:38.612 --> 14:40.912
comfortable, do you want to
switch them around, maybe change

14:40.914 --> 14:42.614
switch them around, maybe change
the men's order at all?

14:42.616 --> 14:43.648
The men's order at all?
>> No, they're good.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.250
>> No, they're good.
>> Okay, then your job is done.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.217
>> Okay, then your job is done.
Now, let me just confirm a

14:46.219 --> 14:47.085
now, let me just confirm a
couple of things.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.887
Couple of things.
First of all, I chose you

14:48.889 --> 14:49.621
first of all, I chose you
completely at random from

14:49.623 --> 14:50.388
completely at random from
tonight's audience.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.055
Tonight's audience.
>> Yes, you did.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.423
>> Yes, you did.
>> You placed those meals, those

14:52.425 --> 14:53.658
>> you placed those meals, those
plates down on the table in any

14:53.660 --> 14:55.159
plates down on the table in any
order you wanted, and you could

14:55.161 --> 14:56.294
order you wanted, and you could
have changed your mind.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.029
Have changed your mind.
Then you chose three random men

14:58.031 --> 14:59.631
then you chose three random men
from tonight's audience, and

14:59.633 --> 15:01.299
from tonight's audience, and
then you gave them an envelope,

15:01.301 --> 15:02.133
then you gave them an envelope,
and you could have changed the

15:02.135 --> 15:02.600
and you could have changed the
order.

15:02.602 --> 15:03.635
Order.
In fact, you did.

15:03.637 --> 15:04.936
In fact, you did.
Then you sat them down in this

15:04.938 --> 15:06.037
then you sat them down in this
order, and even when I asked you

15:06.039 --> 15:06.971
order, and even when I asked you
to change your mind if you

15:06.973 --> 15:08.206
to change your mind if you
wanted to, you said, "no."

15:08.208 --> 15:08.924
Wanted to, you said, "no."
You're happy with the order

15:08.925 --> 15:09.641
you're happy with the order
they're in.

15:09.643 --> 15:10.308
They're in.
>> Yes.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.676
>> Yes.
>> Your intuition led you to

15:11.678 --> 15:13.311
>> your intuition led you to
this point in time, and this is

15:13.313 --> 15:14.479
this point in time, and this is
what it's all been about.

15:14.481 --> 15:15.613
What it's all been about.
Gentlemen, could I ask you to

15:15.615 --> 15:17.682
gentlemen, could I ask you to
open your envelopes, please?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.450
Open your envelopes, please?
Inside your envelopes, there'll

15:19.452 --> 15:20.551
inside your envelopes, there'll
be a message, a message for each

15:20.553 --> 15:22.020

Right meal.
[Cheers and applause]

All the right decisions.
>> Mr. Nick einhorn,

16:42.035 --> 16:43.151
>> Mr. Nick einhorn,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:43.152 --> 16:44.268
Ladies and gentlemen.
Wasn't that incredible?

16:44.270 --> 16:46.304
Wasn't that incredible?
Man, remarkable.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.739
Man, remarkable.
Wonderful stuff.

16:47.741 --> 16:48.673
Wonderful stuff.
>> Hungry?

16:48.675 --> 16:49.407
>> Hungry?
>> Well, I am bit.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.174
>> Well, I am bit.
I can smell the food.

16:50.176 --> 16:50.742
I can smell the food.
It smells good.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.443
It smells good.
That was remarkable, and I'm not

16:52.445 --> 16:53.578
that was remarkable, and I'm not
particularly good with numbers,

16:53.580 --> 16:54.779
particularly good with numbers,
adding up and stuff, but I know

16:54.781 --> 16:56.014
adding up and stuff, but I know
every time you asked something

16:56.016 --> 16:57.148
every time you asked something
and you've give them a multiple

16:57.150 --> 16:57.682
and you've give them a multiple
choice or something, the

16:57.684 --> 16:59.217
choice or something, the
permutations get bigger, and

16:59.219 --> 17:00.051
permutations get bigger, and
bigger, and bigger.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.152
Bigger, and bigger.
So there will probably a few

17:01.154 --> 17:02.186
so there will probably a few
things there were--three

17:02.188 --> 17:03.021
things there were--three
initially you chose, and

17:03.023 --> 17:04.454
initially you chose, and
then the three had the three--

17:04.457 --> 17:05.757
then the three had the three--
>> at least 40 billion.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.492
>> At least 40 billion.
>> Then suddenly dozens if not

17:07.493 --> 17:08.693
>> then suddenly dozens if not
hundreds of permutations.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.727
Hundreds of permutations.
That could have gone any which

17:09.729 --> 17:10.395
that could have gone any which
way.

17:10.396 --> 17:11.163
Way.
>> Yes, it could have.

17:11.164 --> 17:11.930
>> Yes, it could have.
>> Let's find out what penn and

17:11.931 --> 17:12.696
>> let's find out what penn and
teller think.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.132
Teller think.
>> We believe that your audience

17:14.134 --> 17:16.233
>> we believe that your audience
selection was really random.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.269
Selection was really random.
Then it took a while to get the

17:18.271 --> 17:20.038
then it took a while to get the
people up on stage.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.773
People up on stage.
That time may not seem like much

17:22.776 --> 17:24.509
that time may not seem like much
to a layperson, but to a

17:24.511 --> 17:26.176
to a layperson, but to a
magician, that seems like enough

17:26.179 --> 17:28.445
magician, that seems like enough
time for you to very clearly

17:28.448 --> 17:30.415
time for you to very clearly
have in your head the people's

17:30.417 --> 17:31.533
have in your head the people's
names, and, of course, you

17:31.534 --> 17:32.650
names, and, of course, you
already know what the food is

17:32.652 --> 17:35.219
already know what the food is
gonna be, and there's the three

17:35.221 --> 17:37.355
gonna be, and there's the three
tables, and then she gave them

17:37.357 --> 17:38.656
tables, and then she gave them
the envelopes.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.725
The envelopes.
Then you asked her if she wanted

17:40.727 --> 17:44.395
then you asked her if she wanted
to change her mind, and she

17:44.397 --> 17:46.230
to change her mind, and she
did,

17:46.232 --> 17:47.732
did,
and then with things completely

17:47.734 --> 17:51.135
and then with things completely
out of your hands, they switched

17:51.137 --> 17:54.672
out of your hands, they switched
the envelopes, the guys did

17:54.674 --> 17:56.507
the envelopes, the guys did
without you touching them.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.709
Without you touching them.
Then they walked over to the

17:58.711 --> 18:00.645
then they walked over to the
table, and you gave them another

18:00.647 --> 18:03.648
table, and you gave them another
chance to switch, and she

18:03.650 --> 18:08.086
chance to switch, and she

the food on it but the names of

The guys, which you knew.
You asked them.

18:19.499 --> 18:22.200
You asked them.
But it was at the right table

18:22.202 --> 18:24.502

>> 12.
>> 12 cards.

that means, Jonathan, we can pop
yours roughly around the middle

22:40.626 --> 22:41.625
yours roughly around the middle
of the deck.

22:41.627 --> 22:42.493
Of the deck.
Thank you.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.762
Thank you.
And, Mr. teller,

22:44.764 --> 22:47.431
and, Mr. teller,
we'll pop yours slightly

22:47.433 --> 22:48.733
we'll pop yours slightly
near the bottom.

22:48.735 --> 22:51.669
Near the bottom.
So with all three cards in

22:51.671 --> 22:52.636
so with all three cards in
different positions, I'm going

22:52.638 --> 22:53.637
different positions, I'm going
to attempt the impossible now,

22:53.639 --> 22:55.106
to attempt the impossible now,
and that's to find all three

22:55.108 --> 22:56.374
and that's to find all three
cards without ever touching this

22:56.376 --> 22:57.742
cards without ever touching this
deck again.

22:57.744 --> 22:58.976
Deck again.
Tell me, are you right-handed or

22:58.978 --> 23:00.778
tell me, are you right-handed or
left-handed?

23:00.780 --> 23:01.645
Left-handed?
Perfect.

23:01.647 --> 23:02.813
Perfect.
Can you go like this for me?

23:02.815 --> 23:04.548
Can you go like this for me?
Excellent, and put your hand on

23:04.550 --> 23:05.516
excellent, and put your hand on
top.

23:05.518 --> 23:05.983
Top.
Don't move.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.651
Don't move.
I won't touch those cards again.

23:07.653 --> 23:09.019
I won't touch those cards again.
The thought occurred to me I

23:09.021 --> 23:10.488
the thought occurred to me I
could use a different deck to

23:10.490 --> 23:12.056
could use a different deck to
find the exact three cards, and

23:12.058 --> 23:12.990
find the exact three cards, and
in order to do that, I have to

23:12.992 --> 23:14.392
in order to do that, I have to
use what's known in the trade as

23:14.394 --> 23:15.626
use what's known in the trade as
intuitive insight.

23:15.628 --> 23:16.560
Intuitive insight.
Are you familiar with that?

23:16.562 --> 23:17.094
Are you familiar with that?
>> Sure.

23:17.096 --> 23:17.795
>> Sure.
>> Perfect.

23:17.797 --> 23:18.929
>> Perfect.
Well, let me explain to those of

23:18.931 --> 23:21.766
well, let me explain to those of
you who don't.

23:21.768 --> 23:22.967
You who don't.
You can reach a level of

23:22.969 --> 23:24.435
you can reach a level of
performance which goes beyond

23:24.437 --> 23:25.503
performance which goes beyond
conscious thought, and that's

23:25.505 --> 23:26.003
conscious thought, and that's
the idea.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.505
The idea.
So right now, all I need you to

23:27.507 --> 23:29.540
so right now, all I need you to
do is just concentrate for me.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.947
My instincts tell me to stop
right here.

23:36.949 --> 23:37.815
Right here.
For the first time, what was the

23:37.817 --> 23:38.582
for the first time, what was the
name of your card?

23:38.584 --> 23:39.984
Name of your card?
>> King of spades.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.986
>> King of spades.
>> Lo and behold, the king of

23:41.988 --> 23:42.920
>> lo and behold, the king of
spades.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.922
Spades.
[Cheers and applause]

23:50.562 --> 23:54.565
Okay, one down, two to go.
Jonathan, just concentrate for

23:54.567 --> 23:55.900
Jonathan, just concentrate for
me.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.701
Me.
Because this card is no longer

23:57.703 --> 23:58.636
because this card is no longer
in the deck, I've got to

23:58.638 --> 24:00.471
in the deck, I've got to
recalibrate by one card.

24:00.473 --> 24:01.639
Recalibrate by one card.
My instincts tell me to cut one

24:01.641 --> 24:03.507
my instincts tell me to cut one
more time, and I think I'm gonna

24:03.509 --> 24:04.442
more time, and I think I'm gonna
go with this one right here.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.143
Go with this one right here.
What was the name of your card?

24:05.144 --> 24:05.843
What was the name of your card?
>> Eight of hearts.

24:05.845 --> 24:06.944
>> Eight of hearts.
>> The eight of hearts.

24:06.946 --> 24:07.912
>> The eight of hearts.
Lo and behold, ladies and

24:07.914 --> 24:09.980
lo and behold, ladies and
gentlemen, the eight of hearts.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.982
Gentlemen, the eight of hearts.
[Cheers and applause]

24:17.656 --> 24:20.591
King of spades, eight of hearts.
You know what we'll do this

24:20.593 --> 24:21.225
you know what we'll do this
time?

24:21.227 --> 24:22.009
Time?
I'm gonna do the next one

24:22.010 --> 24:22.792
I'm gonna do the next one
without talking.

24:22.795 --> 24:23.961
Without talking.
However, if I get your card

24:23.963 --> 24:24.962
however, if I get your card
right, you can give me a high

24:24.964 --> 24:27.698
right, you can give me a high
five or a thumbs-up.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.700
Five or a thumbs-up.
Shh.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.214
[Cheers and applause]

24:50.055 --> 24:52.823
I have a slight confession.
Although this is a complete

24:52.825 --> 24:54.225
although this is a complete
trick, it's slightly incomplete

24:54.227 --> 24:55.059
trick, it's slightly incomplete
for one reason.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.527
For one reason.
Although these are the cards you

24:56.529 --> 24:57.595
although these are the cards you
chose, they're not the exact

24:57.597 --> 24:58.596
chose, they're not the exact
selections, the ones you signed

24:58.598 --> 24:59.563
selections, the ones you signed
your names on the back, because

24:59.565 --> 25:00.664
your names on the back, because
they're under your hand inside

25:00.666 --> 25:02.199
they're under your hand inside
the deck, but I want to push the

25:02.201 --> 25:03.567
the deck, but I want to push the
boundaries of what's possible.

25:03.569 --> 25:04.702
Boundaries of what's possible.
So if I can just capture the

25:04.704 --> 25:06.971
so if I can just capture the
spirit of all three cards, I

25:06.973 --> 25:08.138
spirit of all three cards, I
believe, Mr. penn,

25:08.140 --> 25:09.840
believe, Mr. penn,
this is how you sign your name.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.208
This is how you sign your name.
>> Looks like my sloppy sign.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.743
>> Looks like my sloppy sign.
>> Jonathan, I believe your

25:12.745 --> 25:13.811
>> Jonathan, I believe your
signature will now be worth

25:13.813 --> 25:16.080
signature will now be worth
millions on ebay, and Mr.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.815
Millions on ebay, and Mr.
teller, I think this card speaks

25:17.817 --> 25:19.750
teller, I think this card speaks
for itself.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.752
For itself.
[Cheers and applause]

25:27.759 --> 25:30.528
>> Michael Vincent, ladies and
gentlemen.

25:30.530 --> 25:31.962
Gentlemen.
That was marvelous.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.831
That was marvelous.
Let's go over here and give

25:33.833 --> 25:35.733
let's go over here and give
them a bit of space there.

25:35.735 --> 25:38.669
Them a bit of space there.
Wow.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.571
Wow.
It takes a brave man to come out

25:40.573 --> 25:41.805
it takes a brave man to come out
here and do an illusion in front

25:41.807 --> 25:42.840
here and do an illusion in front
of two of the masters anyway.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.074
Of two of the masters anyway.
They will know where to look.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.242
They will know where to look.
I mean, we're--let's face it.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.177
I mean, we're--let's face it.
We're idiots.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.045
We're idiots.
>> Muggles is the word, right?

25:48.047 --> 25:48.712
>> Muggles is the word, right?
>> Muggles.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.147
>> Muggles.
Okay, we're not magical people.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.315
Okay, we're not magical people.
>> Yeah, I got that.

25:51.317 --> 25:52.816
>> Yeah, I got that.
>> But they know, I guess, if

25:52.818 --> 25:53.984
>> but they know, I guess, if
they were doing it, where things

25:53.986 --> 25:55.052
they were doing it, where things
would be going on.

25:55.054 --> 25:55.753
Would be going on.
>> Possibly.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.021
>> Possibly.
>> So do you have to work extra

25:57.023 --> 25:58.756
>> so do you have to work extra
hard to conceal stuff, or do you

25:58.758 --> 25:59.690
hard to conceal stuff, or do you
just do as good a job as you

25:59.692 --> 26:00.558
just do as good a job as you
can?

26:00.560 --> 26:01.859
Can?
>> You do the best job you can

26:01.861 --> 26:03.327
>> you do the best job you can
while recognizing it's hard to

26:03.329 --> 26:04.828
while recognizing it's hard to
misdirect a professional

26:04.830 --> 26:06.564
misdirect a professional
magician, because misdirection

26:06.566 --> 26:07.765
magician, because misdirection
and psychology is all part of

26:07.767 --> 26:09.767
and psychology is all part of
the heartbeat of real magic.

26:09.769 --> 26:10.868
The heartbeat of real magic.
>> Are you ready, fellas?

26:10.870 --> 26:11.835
>> Are you ready, fellas?
Can we come on in?

26:11.837 --> 26:12.303
Can we come on in?
>> I think we are.

26:12.305 --> 26:12.970
>> I think we are.
>> Let's go on in.

26:12.972 --> 26:13.971
>> Let's go on in.
I don't think that looks like

26:13.973 --> 26:16.840
I don't think that looks like
you're too confident.

26:16.842 --> 26:20.110
You're too confident.
[Cheers and applause]

26:20.112 --> 26:22.713

No.

the package, I had a little bit

26:37.697 --> 26:39.763

of terror in my heart.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.132
Of terror in my heart.
You are about my favorite

26:42.134 --> 26:42.900

performer.

Better than anyone there.
I'm gonna speak a little bit of

magician needs to learn, and I'm

27:19.839 --> 27:21.939

telling you, I knew exactly what
you were doing and could not

27:24.143 --> 27:27.144
you were doing and could not
see the slightest error.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.646
See the slightest error.
So once again, one of my

27:28.648 --> 27:30.848
so once again, one of my
favorite performers, but you did

27:30.850 --> 27:32.282

not fool us, and I hope you come

27:35.821 --> 27:37.821
>> Thank you so much.
[Cheers and applause]

27:42.961 --> 27:45.062
>> That is just about as good as
it gets, isn't it?

27:45.064 --> 27:47.231
It gets, isn't it?
>> I wish we could convey to

27:47.233 --> 27:49.833

people that he is doing the

27:49.835 --> 27:50.901
people that he is doing the
classic stuff.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.936
Classic stuff.
This is stuff you read in books

27:52.938 --> 27:54.872
this is stuff you read in books
and say, "maybe someday I'll be

27:54.874 --> 27:55.939
and say, "maybe someday I'll be
able to learn it", and you never

27:55.941 --> 27:59.009
able to learn it", and you never
see anyone do it perfectly clean

27:59.011 --> 28:00.944
see anyone do it perfectly clean
with no false moves or anything.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.947
With no false moves or anything.
So for us, I think perhaps we

28:03.949 --> 28:05.315
so for us, I think perhaps we
enjoyed that more than the

28:05.317 --> 28:06.817
enjoyed that more than the
audience, and the audience was

28:06.819 --> 28:07.284
audience, and the audience was
killed by it.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.118
Killed by it.
It's fabulous.

Didn't want us to see you do.
Shall I say more?

34:11.183 --> 34:12.149
Shall I say more?
>> Well, what kind of move are

34:12.150 --> 34:12.900
>> well, what kind of move are
we talking about here?

34:12.900 --> 34:13.650
We talking about here?
Just so we know that you're--

34:13.652 --> 34:14.484
just so we know that you're--
>> a deck switch.

34:14.485 --> 34:15.351
>> A deck switch.
>> A deck switch.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.386
>> A deck switch.
Well, let me ask you.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.088
Well, let me ask you.
Would such a phrase mean

34:18.090 --> 34:19.056
would such a phrase mean
something to you?

34:19.058 --> 34:20.223
Something to you?
>> It's fair to say that that

34:20.225 --> 34:20.757
>> it's fair to say that that
means something to us.

34:20.759 --> 34:21.792
Means something to us.
>> That means something to us,

34:21.793 --> 34:22.793
>> that means something to us,
and if there was a deck switch,

34:22.795 --> 34:27.764
and if there was a deck switch,
then we couldn't do this or

34:27.766 --> 34:29.399
then we couldn't do this or
that.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.333
That.
>> What do you mean?

34:30.335 --> 34:31.168
>> What do you mean?
>> That's empty.

34:31.170 --> 34:31.668
>> That's empty.
This is empty.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.103
This is empty.
There was no deck switch.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.504
There was no deck switch.
>> There was no deck switch.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.639
>> There was no deck switch.
>> Well, we saw you do it.

34:36.641 --> 34:39.342
>> Well, we saw you do it.
We saw as you went across, you

34:39.344 --> 34:40.777
we saw as you went across, you
kind of monkeyed underneath

34:40.779 --> 34:41.445
kind of monkeyed underneath
that.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.612
That.
>> I think it's worth saying at

34:42.614 --> 34:43.713
>> I think it's worth saying at
this point that every single

34:43.715 --> 34:45.114
this point that every single
card that Jonathan shuffled was

34:45.117 --> 34:46.516
card that Jonathan shuffled was
on Jonathan's hand in the order

34:46.518 --> 34:47.217
on Jonathan's hand in the order
he shuffled it.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.585
He shuffled it.
>> That much we promise.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.719
>> That much we promise.
>> You did not do a--you did

34:50.722 --> 34:52.089
>> you did not do a--you did
not switch the deck then?

34:52.091 --> 34:52.806
Not switch the deck then?
>> We did not switch out that

34:52.806 --> 34:53.522
>> we did not switch out that
deck.

34:53.525 --> 34:54.724
Deck.
>> So there was nothing at all

34:54.726 --> 34:57.828
>> so there was nothing at all
done from the time Jonathan

34:57.830 --> 34:59.763
done from the time Jonathan
shuffled the deck, the time

34:59.765 --> 35:01.264
shuffled the deck, the time
Jonathan sat down and you put it

35:01.266 --> 35:01.798
Jonathan sat down and you put it
on his hand.

35:01.800 --> 35:02.766
On his hand.
>> We did not switch out the

35:02.768 --> 35:04.601
>> we did not switch out the
cards that Jonathan shuffled.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.471
Cards that Jonathan shuffled.
>> I think if there was no deck

35:07.473 --> 35:08.672
>> I think if there was no deck
switch, then--

35:08.674 --> 35:09.739
switch, then--
>> well, did you--let me just

35:09.741 --> 35:10.640
>> well, did you--let me just
ask you something.

35:10.642 --> 35:11.241
Ask you something.
>> Never mind just asking

35:11.242 --> 35:11.841
>> never mind just asking
something.

35:11.844 --> 35:13.376
Something.
>> No, no, no, no, no, no.

35:13.378 --> 35:15.812
>> No, no, no, no, no, no.
Did you just to monkey with us

35:15.814 --> 35:18.215
did you just to monkey with us
do a move that looked tricky in

35:18.217 --> 35:19.616
do a move that looked tricky in
order to lead us astray?

35:19.618 --> 35:20.684
Order to lead us astray?
>> Both: No.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.385
>> Both: No.
>> Oh, you didn't?

35:22.387 --> 35:22.853
>> Oh, you didn't?
What the--

35:22.855 --> 35:23.687
what the--
>> do you just naturally

35:23.689 --> 35:24.788
>> do you just naturally
walk around looking like you're

35:24.790 --> 35:26.456
walk around looking like you're
switching decks without...

35:26.458 --> 35:27.891
Switching decks without...
[Laughter]

35:27.893 --> 35:29.192
[Laughter]
>> Well, then I--

35:29.194 --> 35:29.726
>> well, then I--
one more thing.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.795
One more thing.
I've got one more thing to say.

35:31.797 --> 35:32.762
I've got one more thing to say.
You fooled us.

35:32.764 --> 35:33.730
You fooled us.
>> Yeah.

35:33.732 --> 35:36.700
>> Yeah.

[Cheers and applause]

35:49.847 --> 35:54.217
I thought you must have had it.
Do you have any idea even now

35:54.219 --> 35:54.718
do you have any idea even now
how it was done?

35:54.720 --> 35:55.719
How it was done?
>> We have a pretty good idea

35:55.721 --> 35:56.453
>> we have a pretty good idea
now.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.971
Now.
>> Well, it's too late.

35:57.972 --> 35:59.488
>> Well, it's too late.
Okay, so don't go away, then,

35:59.491 --> 36:00.457
okay, so don't go away, then,
because after the break, penn

36:00.459 --> 36:01.558
because after the break, penn
and teller will be right here on

36:01.560 --> 36:02.392
and teller will be right here on
the stage playing Russian

the stage playing Russian
roulette with pneumatic nail

36:03.896 --> 36:04.561
roulette with pneumatic nail
guns.

36:04.563 --> 36:05.795
Guns.
It has to be seen to be

36:05.797 --> 36:06.463
it has to be seen to be
believed.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.430
Believed.
Don't go anywhere.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.432
Don't go anywhere.
[Cheers and applause]

36:15.173 --> 36:20.544
[Cheers and applause]

36:20.878 --> 36:24.414
>> Welcome back to <i> fool us,</i>
where tonight two people have

36:24.416 --> 36:25.315
where tonight two people have
managed to fool penn and teller.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.316
Managed to fool penn and teller.
They'll be playing on their

36:26.318 --> 36:27.284
they'll be playing on their
stage in Las Vegas.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.318
Stage in Las Vegas.
That's incredible, isn't it?

36:28.320 --> 36:30.253
That's incredible, isn't it?
Congratulations.

36:30.255 --> 36:31.321
Congratulations.
[Cheers and applause]

36:31.323 --> 36:32.072
[Cheers and applause]
Okay, well, I've loved all the

36:32.073 --> 36:32.822
okay, well, I've loved all the
performers tonight, but this is

36:32.824 --> 36:33.723
performers tonight, but this is
the bit I've been most looking

36:33.725 --> 36:34.491
the bit I've been most looking
forward to.

36:34.493 --> 36:35.525
Forward to.
If you're of a nervous

36:35.527 --> 36:37.527
if you're of a nervous
disposition or if you work for

36:37.529 --> 36:39.229
disposition or if you work for
health and safety, look away

36:39.231 --> 36:40.497
health and safety, look away
now, because playing Russian

36:40.499 --> 36:42.465
now, because playing Russian
roulette with a pneumatic nail

36:42.467 --> 36:44.267
roulette with a pneumatic nail
gun for your pleasure, please

36:44.269 --> 36:45.869
gun for your pleasure, please
welcome onstage the fabulous,

36:45.871 --> 36:47.871
welcome onstage the fabulous,
the unique penn and teller.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.873
The unique penn and teller.
[Cheers and applause]

36:57.281 --> 37:01.985
>> Thank you.
Now, this magic trick is kind of

37:01.987 --> 37:03.787
now, this magic trick is kind of
about memorization, kind of

37:03.789 --> 37:05.455
about memorization, kind of
about focus, and kind of about

37:05.457 --> 37:06.623
about focus, and kind of about
concentration.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.325
Concentration.
Now, memorization acts have been

37:08.327 --> 37:09.893
now, memorization acts have been
out of fashion for many, many

37:09.895 --> 37:10.660
out of fashion for many, many
years.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.295
Years.
We tried to make our version a

37:12.297 --> 37:14.898
we tried to make our version a
little bit less totally cerebral

37:14.900 --> 37:18.368
little bit less totally cerebral
by adding in a nail gun.

37:18.370 --> 37:19.869
By adding in a nail gun.
And I hope you're all aware of

37:19.871 --> 37:22.572
and I hope you're all aware of
how bad nail guns are.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.341
How bad nail guns are.
They're responsible for about

37:24.343 --> 37:27.244
they're responsible for about
30,000 emergency room visits a

37:27.246 --> 37:29.813
30,000 emergency room visits a
year in the United States, and

37:29.815 --> 37:31.014
year in the United States, and
that's compressed air over

37:31.016 --> 37:32.749
that's compressed air over
there, and it's forcing out the

37:32.751 --> 37:33.683
there, and it's forcing out the
nails with a great deal of

37:33.685 --> 37:34.417
nails with a great deal of
power,

37:34.419 --> 37:36.353
power,
certainly enough power to go all

37:36.355 --> 37:37.721
certainly enough power to go all
the way through that board into

37:37.723 --> 37:39.022
the way through that board into
another board and fasten them

37:39.024 --> 37:40.523
another board and fasten them
together for construction

37:40.525 --> 37:41.358
together for construction
purposes.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.392
Purposes.
But I've thwarted that.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.260
But I've thwarted that.
By putting the board

37:43.262 --> 37:44.527
by putting the board
on a metal table,

37:44.529 --> 37:47.030
on a metal table,
the nails stick out a little

37:47.032 --> 37:48.265
the nails stick out a little
bit.

37:48.267 --> 37:49.566
Bit.
Now, we're talking about

37:49.568 --> 37:53.270
now, we're talking about
memorization, and the trick

37:53.272 --> 37:56.339
memorization, and the trick
looks like this.

37:56.341 --> 37:57.374
Looks like this.
Now, the nail gun is loaded

37:57.376 --> 37:59.476
now, the nail gun is loaded
right here, and it's loaded with

37:59.478 --> 38:02.045
right here, and it's loaded with
what's called a string, which is

38:02.047 --> 38:04.714
what's called a string, which is
two pieces of rigid plastic that

38:04.716 --> 38:06.616
two pieces of rigid plastic that
hold the nails perpendicular,

38:06.618 --> 38:08.451
hold the nails perpendicular,
equidistant from one another.

38:08.453 --> 38:09.519
Equidistant from one another.
When you pull nails out of the

38:09.521 --> 38:11.421
when you pull nails out of the
string, whenever the nail gun

38:11.423 --> 38:13.390
string, whenever the nail gun
comes to one of those spaces, it

38:13.392 --> 38:14.724
comes to one of those spaces, it
still fires the air and makes

38:14.726 --> 38:17.494
still fires the air and makes
the noise, but it does not fire

38:17.496 --> 38:18.995
the noise, but it does not fire
a nail.

38:18.997 --> 38:24.000
A nail.
So all I have to do is memorize

38:24.002 --> 38:28.038
so all I have to do is memorize
this sequence, and I can do

38:28.040 --> 38:30.040
this sequence, and I can do
this.

38:59.870 --> 39:03.039
That's the trick.
[Cheers and applause]

39:09.780 --> 39:13.750
Now, you've noticed by now that
I'm not just alternating.

39:13.752 --> 39:16.419
I'm not just alternating.
As a matter of fact, the pattern

39:16.421 --> 39:18.888
as a matter of fact, the pattern
does not repeat for the whole

39:18.890 --> 39:20.357
does not repeat for the whole
trick.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.524
Trick.
Now, if you've seen a

39:21.526 --> 39:23.793
now, if you've seen a
memorization act in vaudeville,

39:23.795 --> 39:25.362
memorization act in vaudeville,
there obviously would not have

39:25.364 --> 39:26.463
there obviously would not have
been a nail gun.

39:26.465 --> 39:27.831
Been a nail gun.
It would have all been done with

39:27.833 --> 39:29.666
it would have all been done with
numbers and words.

39:29.668 --> 39:31.368
Numbers and words.
The performer would have gotten

39:31.370 --> 39:35.638
the performer would have gotten
maybe 40 single-digit numbers

39:35.640 --> 39:37.707
maybe 40 single-digit numbers
yelled out by the audience,

39:37.709 --> 39:40.477
yelled out by the audience,
memorized that almost random

39:40.479 --> 39:42.412
memorized that almost random
sequence, and then written it

39:42.414 --> 39:44.381
sequence, and then written it
back perfectly on a chalkboard

39:44.383 --> 39:48.518
back perfectly on a chalkboard
while reciting any Shakespeare

39:48.520 --> 39:50.754
while reciting any Shakespeare
sonnet chosen by the audience,

39:50.756 --> 39:53.490
sonnet chosen by the audience,
and this is the exact same

39:53.492 --> 39:56.926
and this is the exact same
trick.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.962
Trick.
Just like wire walking.

39:58.964 --> 40:01.464
Just like wire walking.
It's the exact same trick if the

40:01.466 --> 40:03.900
it's the exact same trick if the
tight wire is set 4 feet off

40:03.902 --> 40:08.138
tight wire is set 4 feet off
the ground as if it's set 50

40:08.140 --> 40:11.107
the ground as if it's set 50
feet off the ground, and yet if

40:11.109 --> 40:11.941
feet off the ground, and yet if
you add a little it of

40:11.943 --> 40:13.910
you add a little it of
danger...

40:13.912 --> 40:20.583
Danger...
[Laughter]

40:20.585 --> 40:22.585
[Laughter]
[Makes popping noises]

40:39.637 --> 40:44.441
[Laughter]
When you add a little bit of

40:44.443 --> 40:46.776
when you add a little bit of
danger to the mix, it makes the

40:46.778 --> 40:52.148
danger to the mix, it makes the
whole show just a little more

40:52.150 --> 40:54.517
whole show just a little more
[Laughter]

40:54.519 --> 40:55.685
[Laughter]
Visceral,

40:55.687 --> 41:00.457
visceral,
a little more exciting.

41:00.459 --> 41:04.828
A little more exciting.
Now, most memorization acts are

41:04.830 --> 41:06.963
now, most memorization acts are
magic tricks, they're lies, and

41:06.965 --> 41:08.665
magic tricks, they're lies, and
we don't mind you knowing that,

41:08.667 --> 41:10.233
we don't mind you knowing that,
because teller and I believe it

41:10.235 --> 41:12.635
because teller and I believe it
is morally wrong to do things

41:12.637 --> 41:14.571
is morally wrong to do things
onstage that are really

41:14.573 --> 41:15.638
onstage that are really
dangerous.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.639
Dangerous.
It makes the audience

41:16.641 --> 41:19.676
it makes the audience
complicit in unnecessary human

41:19.678 --> 41:20.510
complicit in unnecessary human
risk.

41:20.512 --> 41:22.679
Risk.
Any doubts about this being a

41:22.681 --> 41:27.684
any doubts about this being a
lie, I think that proves it

41:27.686 --> 41:28.852
lie, I think that proves it
right there.

41:28.854 --> 41:32.188
Right there.
[Cheers and applause]

41:32.190 --> 41:34.591
[Cheers and applause]
>> Remarkable.

41:34.593 --> 41:35.925
>> Remarkable.
Fabulous.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.760
Fabulous.
Awesome.

41:37.762 --> 41:38.795
Awesome.
Wow.

41:38.797 --> 41:39.863
Wow.
Ladies and gentlemen, the

41:39.865 --> 41:41.130
ladies and gentlemen, the
brilliant but clearly deranged

41:41.132 --> 41:42.632
brilliant but clearly deranged
penn and teller.

41:42.634 --> 41:47.136
Penn and teller.
[Cheers and applause]

41:47.138 --> 41:47.937
[Cheers and applause]
