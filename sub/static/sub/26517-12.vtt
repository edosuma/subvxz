00:02.567 --> 00:03.742
Previously
onCrazy Ex-Girlfriend...Dr. Shin,

00:03.786 --> 00:05.222
he's gonna prescribe me
a bunch of meds,

00:05.266 --> 00:07.050
like doctors always do.
And they're not gonna work.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.834
And I'm gonna end up
back here. Hello, Rebecca.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.184
All of the other meds
I've been prescribed

00:10.227 --> 00:12.447
have made me numb or drowsy. I think,

00:12.490 --> 00:13.535
with the right diagnosis

00:13.578 --> 00:14.840
and treatment,

00:14.884 --> 00:16.451
you can get a lot better.

00:16.494 --> 00:18.931
I have been dreaming about
going to Raging Waters with you

00:18.975 --> 00:21.673
ever since you told me about it
that day at camp.

00:21.717 --> 00:25.112
Let's do something fun,
like go to Raging Waters?

00:25.155 --> 00:26.722
He took her to Raging Waters!

00:26.765 --> 00:28.115
That's her Paris!

00:28.158 --> 00:29.812
I'm gonna be a lawyer.

00:29.855 --> 00:32.032
Well, you have worked so hard.
You're almost there, babe.

00:32.075 --> 00:32.945
Paula knows the office, like,

00:32.989 --> 00:34.077
inside and out.

00:34.121 --> 00:34.860
Paula's in charge.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.036
She can handle it all.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.080
Somebody else always does it.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.777
I am the someone else!

00:38.821 --> 00:40.127
You know what, it's okay.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.389
Let me be happy.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.826
I want you to be happy. I do.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.871
REBECCA: Greg makes me feel
like I'm okay.

00:45.915 --> 00:48.396
Maybe we could be
the best versions of ourselves

00:48.439 --> 00:50.137
if we're together.

REBECCA:
Ah, this is great.

01:32.135 --> 01:34.877
What a perfect day.Hmm.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.446
How many times are we gonna
circle this one block?

01:38.489 --> 01:41.188
Well, you go one block east,
that's the freeway.

01:41.231 --> 01:42.798
Mm.And one block west
is the other freeway.

01:42.841 --> 01:45.279
So this is just
the perfect block.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.890
I love just doing stuff
like this with you.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.370
Yeah.

01:49.413 --> 01:52.373
You know, holding hands
is a strange concept.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.157
If you think about it,
it actually makes more sense

01:54.201 --> 01:55.724
to hold someone's elbow.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.726
Less sweaty, less germy,

01:57.769 --> 02:01.164
and the elbow gets so little
love otherwise, you know?

02:01.208 --> 02:03.166
Uh-huh. That's
a funny point,

02:03.210 --> 02:05.168
but I like hands.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.127
Um, hi.Hi.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.129
So, I have an idea.

02:09.172 --> 02:11.696
A notion. A concept.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.742
Une idée folle.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.657
The last time you said that,
you wanted to look into my eyes

02:15.700 --> 02:17.180
for 20 minutes straight.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.616
I know. Wasn't that great?

02:18.660 --> 02:20.052
I got to know
your eyes so well.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.142
I could draw your eyes
with my eyes closed.

02:22.185 --> 02:25.449
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I guess
you could do that now.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.538
So...

02:27.582 --> 02:29.149
we've been dating
for a few weeks now.

02:29.192 --> 02:30.976
I am new Rebecca,
you are new Greg.

02:31.020 --> 02:34.197
We have been taking it slow
in a really mature way.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.285
Yeah, I'm not sure
we've been sticking

02:35.329 --> 02:37.200
to that "taking it slow" thing.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.071
We've spent
the last two weeks together,

02:39.115 --> 02:40.551
every single night.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.162
I know. And I'm sorry
about last night.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.946
I know you said you wanted
to spend the night alone

02:43.989 --> 02:46.731
to get a full eight hours, but
then I got afraid of the dark.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.298
So thank you for coming over.

02:48.342 --> 02:49.952
I'm a hero.

02:49.995 --> 02:50.953
You are.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.346
Truly.Mm.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.261
Okay, so we've been having
so much fun together.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.959
I was thinking
we could have more fun

02:57.002 --> 03:00.441
at the most romantic place
on Earth.

03:00.484 --> 03:01.790
Paris?

03:01.833 --> 03:03.226
Raging Waters!

03:03.270 --> 03:05.881
Oh...What do you say, babe?

03:05.924 --> 03:08.100
Oh, I'm sorry. In a mature,
taking-it-slow relationship,

03:08.144 --> 03:09.406
is "babe" okay?

03:09.450 --> 03:12.148
Yeah. "Babe"
is completely okay, babe.Okay.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.455
All right, I know you don't like
water parks or amusement parks

03:14.498 --> 03:19.024
or... parks, but you've
never been to one with me.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.591
Uh, yeah. I don't know though.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.333
Groups of people having fun
and enjoying themselves,

03:23.377 --> 03:25.117
it's-it's not my thing.

03:25.161 --> 03:26.249
God, don't be grumpy.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.338
You have a bad case
of the Mondays.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.949
Oh, whoa. No, never say that.

03:30.993 --> 03:33.865
And if I see you on Wednesday
and you call it Hump Day,

03:33.909 --> 03:35.345
it's over.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.608
Okay. Listen,

03:37.652 --> 03:41.133
I really want to go
to this water park with you.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.353
Please.

03:43.397 --> 03:44.833
What do you say?

03:44.876 --> 03:46.487
What do you say?

03:46.530 --> 03:48.706
What do you say?

03:48.750 --> 03:50.142
What do you say?

03:50.186 --> 03:52.144
All right. Yeah, I don't want
to be a dick about this.

03:52.188 --> 03:53.145
Let's do it.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.451
Yay!

03:54.495 --> 03:56.061
Thanks!

04:06.115 --> 04:07.464
Bad case
of the Mondays, huh?

04:07.508 --> 04:08.987
Oh, who the hell knows?

04:09.031 --> 04:10.989
My whole life is
Mondays right now.

04:11.033 --> 04:12.991
Between work and kids and
studying for the bar,

04:13.035 --> 04:15.167
I'm... wiped.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.474
Yeah. And I want you
to take this the wrong way--

04:17.518 --> 04:19.302
you look like crap.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.131
You want to use my office,
take a woman nap?

04:22.174 --> 04:23.219
Oh, I napped once.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.221
It was 1983.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.179
It was great.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.964
Is there anything I should know
before I head down

04:29.007 --> 04:29.965
to county jail today?

04:30.008 --> 04:30.966
Today? No, no, no.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.228
You're not going. I'm going.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.057
Huh? No.
It's my turn.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.799
Rebecca was last week, this week
is me, and then you'll go...No. No, no, no, no.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.192
I have to go and make
sure everything's taken
care of properly...

04:40.236 --> 04:41.585
No, you don't.
I can handle it, all right?

04:41.629 --> 04:43.370
You have Hanifa's hearing today.

04:43.413 --> 04:44.632
I'm aware.Paula,

04:44.675 --> 04:46.329
the fact that you are
volunteering and working

04:46.373 --> 04:48.984
while you're studying
for the bar exam is insane.

04:49.027 --> 04:52.248
When I studied for the bar,
I just went to my uncle's island

04:52.292 --> 04:53.467
and unplugged.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.382
I suggest you do the same.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.342
Nathaniel.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.212
Mm-hmm.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.213
I got this.

05:01.257 --> 05:02.432
I'm fine.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.347
I have to do all these things.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.131
I will do all these things.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.698
I just need a little coffee,

05:07.742 --> 05:11.528
and my real problem
is that these mugs...

05:11.572 --> 05:13.965
are too damn small.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.366
REBECCA: I have been
in Southern California

05:23.410 --> 05:24.498
for such a long time,

05:24.541 --> 05:26.456
and I still haven't been
to Raging Waters

05:26.500 --> 05:29.241
because I've been waiting to go
with a special someone.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.635
And now he's here.

05:31.679 --> 05:34.072
You have very powerful
feelings for Greg.

05:34.116 --> 05:36.292
And... water slides.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.338
Oh, yeah. Whew.But the last time

05:38.381 --> 05:40.470
I saw you, which was weeks ago--

05:40.514 --> 05:43.081
you've been rescheduling
frequently...

05:43.125 --> 05:44.866
Ooh, sorry....you also
expressed feelings

05:44.909 --> 05:47.390
for Nathaniel and Josh.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.697
Who? No. Oh, no, no. I'm not
thinking about them right now.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.002
No.You also mentioned

05:51.046 --> 05:53.353
you intended on taking
things slow with Greg,

05:53.396 --> 05:55.833
which I thought
was a wise decision,

05:55.877 --> 05:58.358
since you do need to
continue the hard work

05:58.401 --> 06:00.229
on managing your BPD.Yep.

06:00.272 --> 06:01.622
And I'm doing that.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.189
Totally. I'm just--
That's what I'm doing.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.713
How's group therapy?

06:05.756 --> 06:08.106
Haven't needed it.

06:08.150 --> 06:11.458
I have it all under control.

06:11.501 --> 06:15.418
I have that darkness
under control.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.072
I don't think
I need to monitor

06:17.115 --> 06:21.424
the situation
that closely anymore.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.731
I mean, it's like you said,
I'm a loving person

06:23.774 --> 06:26.473
who deserves love, and now
I'm-I'm finally getting some.

06:26.516 --> 06:28.344
And gettin' some.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.737
Ah. I see.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.086
Uh...Sex.

06:31.129 --> 06:33.349
Yeah, I-I got that.Yeah.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.264
I just don't want you to forget

06:35.307 --> 06:38.354
the work that you need to do
for self-care

06:38.398 --> 06:42.010
right now, because romantic
love for you can be tricky.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.404
Yeah. Okay.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.449
So?So,

06:46.493 --> 06:48.669
I know how you feel
about medication,

06:48.712 --> 06:49.931
but I am

06:49.974 --> 06:52.803
once again going
to recommend antidepressants

06:52.847 --> 06:53.978
to help stabilize
your mood.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.980
No. No. M-Medication?

06:56.024 --> 06:59.419
No. No, I've told you
over and over, I'm--

06:59.462 --> 07:01.116
No, I'm not doing that. No.

07:01.159 --> 07:02.900
But, Rebecca...When I was in college,

07:02.944 --> 07:04.467
they gave me those pills,
and I was a zombie.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.643
New York, pills, zombie.

07:06.687 --> 07:09.429
My mother put pills in my
milkshake to make me a zombie.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.996
And then the last time
I took pills,

07:12.040 --> 07:13.911
lest we forget, was on a plane.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.913
Those were totally
different medications

07:15.957 --> 07:18.089
than what I would recommend.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.483
Dr. Shin and I have
conferred on this.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.137
Rebecca,

07:22.180 --> 07:23.921
you have done so much work.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.270
Exactly.

07:25.314 --> 07:28.273
Do you have any idea
how many workbooks I've done?

07:28.317 --> 07:29.927
Have you done any lately?

07:29.971 --> 07:31.102
I... I'm sorry,

07:31.146 --> 07:33.583
I came in here
just wanting to talk

07:33.627 --> 07:36.151
about going to a water park
with my boyfriend.

07:36.194 --> 07:37.587
Okay, I see you're upset.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.371
Yeah. I got to go.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.373
Rebecca, I'm concerned.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.071
You won't go to group,

07:43.114 --> 07:44.638
you haven't been
seeing Dr. Shin,

07:44.681 --> 07:46.509
you won't consider medication.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.206
If you discontinue
our work,

07:48.250 --> 07:51.079
I'm worried
you're gonna backslide.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.820
Let's go on a slide backwards.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.517
Whee!

08:08.009 --> 08:09.401
REBECCA:
This is so nice.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.969
It's-it's, like,
even nicer than I dreamed.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.318
Yeah, I like it.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.320
And they have my
brand of diet soda.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.974
I'm a man of few needs.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.715
Just me and a
cup of diet soda

08:18.759 --> 08:20.630
the size of eight
cups of diet soda.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.240
Okay, what rides
do you want to go on first?

08:22.284 --> 08:24.242
We could go on Dr. Von Dark's
Tunnel of Terror.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.070
We could go
on the Dark Hole.

08:26.114 --> 08:27.332
I don't go on rides.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.858
What?

08:30.901 --> 08:32.120
We're at a water park,

08:32.163 --> 08:34.035
and you don't go on rides?

08:34.078 --> 08:35.863
Why didn't you say anything?

08:35.906 --> 08:38.213
Well, I-I tried to, but
you-you kind of steamrolled...Oh, geez.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.867
Well, now I feel
like an idiot.

08:39.910 --> 08:42.347
I'm gonna be going
on water slides alone?

08:42.391 --> 08:43.566
Well, I will walk you to a ride.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.959
I will hang out
while you ride.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.135
I will take an exit photo
of you leaving the ride.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.398
I will even let you describe
the ride experience

08:49.441 --> 08:51.182
and smile at every adjective.

08:51.226 --> 08:54.098
Okay.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.273
Really okay?

08:55.317 --> 08:56.884
Or fake okay?

08:56.927 --> 08:58.146
Hey, babe?

08:58.189 --> 08:59.321
Yeah, babe?

08:59.364 --> 09:01.715
Just go on one ride
with me, hmm,

09:01.758 --> 09:05.327
so I don't seem like the creepy
adult riding a ride alone?

09:05.370 --> 09:07.155
You know what, you're right.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.070
I don't want you
to be that woman,

09:09.113 --> 09:11.159
and I don't want to be
withthat woman.

09:11.202 --> 09:12.421
Yes.So-- Okay.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.597
All right. Sure.Thank you.

09:14.641 --> 09:15.598
PAULA:
So,

09:15.642 --> 09:16.773
about this judge,
he is tough

09:16.817 --> 09:19.210
on granting
parole transfers.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.647
So we have your proof
of employment.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.213
We've got the lease
to your new apartment in Irvine.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.301
Yep. Got it all
right here,

09:23.345 --> 09:24.868
along with a letter
from my new boss.

09:24.912 --> 09:28.393
Great. Um, the good news
is that I know this judge,

09:28.437 --> 09:30.700
and I can get him to approve
the move. I'm sure of it.

09:30.744 --> 09:33.137
So, I'm very excited, Hanifa.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.487
I am feeling great.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.402
Are you?
'Cause you look like hell.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.187
And please take offense at that.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.928
Uh, I'm under the weather,

09:40.971 --> 09:44.453
and I'm-I'm fighting something,
so...

09:45.846 --> 09:48.065
Whoa. I don't think
the dosage is eight.

09:48.109 --> 09:51.242
I don't think the dosage
to anything is eight.No,

09:51.286 --> 09:52.504
I'm gonna be fine.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.508
These are really gonna hit
the spot.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.083
Your Honor, we are here

10:06.127 --> 10:09.521
and feeling totally fine.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.743
Now, Ms. Downey is
looking to relocate,

10:13.787 --> 10:16.224
and we need to
amend her parole.

10:20.663 --> 10:23.187
Oh! Great picture.Okay.

10:23.231 --> 10:24.754
Okay, yeah,
go to the other side.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.060
I'll go here. Sir,

10:26.103 --> 10:28.628
can you take
a picture of us?Yeah.

10:28.671 --> 10:29.803
Okay.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.239
No. Put your arms up.Hmm?

10:31.282 --> 10:32.675
Just, like, put your arm...
put your...
Oh, okay.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.111
Put your arms...
Okay. Okay.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.026
Okay. Okay.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.246
Ah!

10:38.289 --> 10:39.508
Oh!
Oh!

10:39.551 --> 10:41.553
Oh!

10:43.991 --> 10:45.383
That's funny.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.516
It's-- That was funny.All right.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.264
REBECCA:
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

10:56.307 --> 10:58.179
We're gonna have
so much fun. Okay.

10:58.222 --> 11:01.573
Okay. All right,
and... we're off.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.488
Okay!

11:03.532 --> 11:05.186
Okay...

11:05.229 --> 11:07.057
Oh!

11:07.101 --> 11:08.798
Whoo!

11:09.886 --> 11:11.279
Whee!

11:14.064 --> 11:15.675
REBECCA:
I was so excited

11:15.718 --> 11:18.199
to frame a picture of us on a
ride, but I can't frame this.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.766
You look miserable.

11:19.809 --> 11:23.378
Well, you could frame it and
draw on a smile so I seem happy.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.902
Yeah. Ha ha, you're
making fun of me. Ha ha.

11:25.946 --> 11:30.124
Hey, let me set my cutlery aside

11:30.167 --> 11:32.953
for a moment to say,
you seem very annoyed with me.

11:32.996 --> 11:36.434
I just... I had expectations
for how this day would go.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.393
You know, I thought,

11:38.436 --> 11:40.308
I'm new Rebecca,
and you're new Greg,

11:40.351 --> 11:42.745
so maybe things
would be different.Okay, hold on.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.704
Yes, I've changed.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.010
I don't drink,
I don't punch walls,

11:47.054 --> 11:50.579
I don't hate myself nearly
as much, but I'm still Greg.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.624
I'm still me.I know.

11:52.668 --> 11:55.018
I just... I stupidly thought

11:55.062 --> 11:57.368
that if we were here,
and we were together,

11:57.412 --> 11:59.762
that you would like it.

11:59.806 --> 12:03.200
Ah, you thought
I'd likesomething.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.941
Hmm.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.943

So let's just go.
Let's just go.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.486
Well, at least
I'm outside in the sun.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.583
What is going on
with you today?

15:32.627 --> 15:36.283
Oh. Um, well, Hanifa got
her transfer to Irvine,

15:36.326 --> 15:38.285
I talked circles
around that judge,

15:38.328 --> 15:41.418
and I just aced the first
section of my practice test.

15:41.462 --> 15:44.073
No, I meant, cover up, lady.
This ain't a beach.

15:44.117 --> 15:47.207
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.
I'm just... I'm so hot.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.860
Are you hot?

15:48.904 --> 15:50.645
No.I mean, I'm so hot.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.822
Like, I feel like I'm living
in a pizza oven over here.

15:53.865 --> 15:56.433
If it makes you feel worse,
you also look like crap.

15:56.477 --> 16:00.263
People keep saying stuff like
that to me, and it's so fun.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.265
Mm.Look, I don't know.

16:02.309 --> 16:06.182
I just... I feel achy and
lethargic, and I am burning up.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.315
I just... I don't
know what it is.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.751
Hmm. Let me think.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.797
Middle-aged woman, sweating
a lot, feeling like crap.

16:12.841 --> 16:15.322
Wonder what it could be.Oh, come on.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.411
It is not menopause.

16:17.454 --> 16:21.023
Okay, I still get a very,
verypowerful period.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.330
It's like the
earth cracking open,

16:23.373 --> 16:26.463
and just hot lava
just pouring out.

16:26.507 --> 16:27.856
Sorry. I'm just super hot,

16:27.899 --> 16:29.684
so all my similes are
gonna be fire-based.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.816
Babe, I went through it.
It's manageable.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.862
You just got
to get to your doctor.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.864
Maybe you're right. I will
get to it at some point.

16:35.907 --> 16:38.040
It is not urgent.
Menopause goes on for years.

16:38.084 --> 16:41.870
I am just... Oh, my God,
right now, I am just so hot.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.046
I just want to work topless.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.439
What do you think?

16:45.482 --> 16:46.962
Probably inappropriate,

16:47.006 --> 16:49.312
but I'd like to see
what you're rockin'.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.097
Thank you.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.490
Get to your gyno.Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:00.323 --> 17:03.152
Hey, uh, if you don't mind,
I'm just gonna drop you here.

17:03.196 --> 17:06.503
It's been a long day, and I
don't know if I'm in the mood

17:06.547 --> 17:08.940
to see the hairs on top
of Josh's pubic mons.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.379
All right. Wow.
You're in a really bad mood.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.685
I mean, you just used
the word "pubic mons,"

17:14.729 --> 17:16.557
which I've never heard
anyone say out loud.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.602
Okay, look, you're
upset, I-I see that,

17:18.646 --> 17:21.562
but did you not hear what
I said at the water park?

17:21.605 --> 17:23.477
I mean, I hate myself
for saying it,

17:23.520 --> 17:26.045
but I said "Love
conquers all."Okay, you know what?

17:26.088 --> 17:28.569
I just... I don't think
you meant it. I-I can tell.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.049
I know what you're thinking.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.355
You're thinking that I'm an
idiot and that I'm annoying.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.096
Huh.

17:34.140 --> 17:37.708
Hey, have you changed
anything recently?

17:37.752 --> 17:39.232
Like, different
therapy thing?

17:39.275 --> 17:40.972
Like, have you still
been doing your stuff?

17:41.016 --> 17:44.193
I'm only asking because,
I know from my own experience,

17:44.237 --> 17:45.716
if I stop hitting
those meetings,

17:45.760 --> 17:47.718
I start taking
things too personally

17:47.762 --> 17:50.286
and-and kind
of overreacting.

17:50.330 --> 17:54.203
Oh, so, I'm overreacting,
Dr. Man?

17:54.247 --> 17:55.857
That's what you're saying?
I'm hysterical

17:55.900 --> 17:58.251
and over-- ovary-acting?

17:58.294 --> 17:59.339
Whoa.You said

17:59.382 --> 18:01.123
you weren't gonna be
a dick today,

18:01.167 --> 18:03.691
but that was clearly
not the case, babe.

18:06.172 --> 18:09.131
Uh-huh.

18:11.394 --> 18:15.181
I want to help you,
but it just seems to me

18:15.224 --> 18:18.140
like you need to be
angry and sad right now,

18:18.184 --> 18:20.925
so I'm gonna just go.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.362
Leaving. Great.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.190
That's a classic
Greg move. Yeah.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.626
You like doing that.

18:25.669 --> 18:30.283
Oh, hey, I found something
that you actually like!

18:30.326 --> 18:32.067
"You seem sad, Rebecca."

18:32.111 --> 18:34.069
"Something's wrong, Rebecca."

18:35.375 --> 18:36.767
"I don't like slides, Rebecca."

18:36.811 --> 18:39.553
"You should go back
to group therapy, Rebecca."

18:39.596 --> 18:41.598
"Take some meds, Rebecca."

Yes, you are.

20:54.992 --> 20:58.561
What is happening?I just...

20:58.605 --> 21:00.259
I wanted to see you.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.609
Hon-Honestly. Honestly,
I wanted to see you

21:02.652 --> 21:05.220
because the last
conversation we had,

21:05.264 --> 21:08.484
you were so wonderful.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.573
You were so sweet and kind

21:10.617 --> 21:12.488
and mature,

21:12.532 --> 21:14.055
and you just want
me to be happy,

21:14.098 --> 21:15.491
which is what I want, too.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.493
And, God, Greg. Greg doesn't
know what happiness is.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.321
And Dr. Akopian

21:19.365 --> 21:21.497
just wants me to be this
narcotized vegetable.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.239
Okay.No, no, but forget her, forget
her, forget her, forget her.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.719
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.634
Let's talk about you.
Let's talk about you.

21:27.677 --> 21:30.245
Let me tell you
what I am wondering.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.116
Who is the man of my dreams?

21:32.160 --> 21:34.510
Who is the mons of my dreams?

21:34.554 --> 21:37.731
: Who is the
pubic mons of my dreams?

21:37.774 --> 21:39.602
What?C'mons, baby, kiss me.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.038
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.736
Hmm?Did you have, like,
a billion drinks tonight?

21:42.779 --> 21:45.695
No, I did not have
a billion, sir.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.218
I had three.

21:47.262 --> 21:50.265
Which, to a petite Jewess,
equals a billion.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.745
Why don't we do this.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.616
Let's just take off our clothes

21:53.660 --> 21:55.749
and see what happens.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.533
Okay, I'm gonna
put you in an Uber.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.622
Really?

21:59.666 --> 22:02.538
Come on. Come on.

22:02.582 --> 22:05.280
You know I still
think about you.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.847
At night

22:06.890 --> 22:08.805
when I'm alone in my bed.

22:11.547 --> 22:13.506
You really got to go.

22:14.550 --> 22:15.812
Come on.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.640
Okay, wow. I just...

22:17.684 --> 22:19.686
I j... I just thought
you wanted me.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.122
I thought this was
what you wanted,

22:21.165 --> 22:22.819
so it's, like, weird that
you're ushering me out.

22:22.863 --> 22:24.691
Get some good sleep
tonight, okay? Okay.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.475
I will. I will. She will.

22:26.519 --> 22:27.868
And I don't need you
to call me an Uber.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.783
I can get my own Uber.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.393
And I'm gonna get
a great Uber,

22:31.437 --> 22:33.308
one with cool lights
and terrible music

22:33.352 --> 22:34.875
and water bottles
and old mints

22:34.918 --> 22:38.531
and a driver
who's a screenwriter.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.547
Whoa.Hmm.

22:54.590 --> 22:56.026
What are you doing?

22:56.070 --> 22:58.507
Baking banana bread. What
does it look like I'm doing?

22:58.551 --> 22:59.856
You smell weird.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.292
That's the primrose oil.

23:02.990 --> 23:05.906
Mrs. H thinks I'm going through
some kind of premenopause thing.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.734
And I'm gonna get to
the gyno at some point,

23:07.777 --> 23:11.346
but in the meantime,
I feel like absolute crapburger.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.002
And I look like one, too,
according to everyone around me.

23:15.045 --> 23:16.482
But I read online

23:16.525 --> 23:19.528
that primrose oil helps,
so I am basically bathed in it.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.400
Babe, you need to take a break.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.750
You're working too hard
and too much.

23:23.793 --> 23:26.274
What? I am fine.
I have to do this.

23:26.317 --> 23:27.797
The bar is coming up any second,

23:27.841 --> 23:30.757
and I don't have any uncles
with islands.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.280
I mean, my Uncle Terry

23:32.323 --> 23:34.456
has that condo in Tahoe,
but it's a timeshare,

23:34.500 --> 23:36.371
and he only gets it
for a week and a half in July.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.418
Well, can I help at all?

23:39.461 --> 23:41.420
Yeah, can you put these back
in the freezer

23:41.463 --> 23:43.422
and bring me back
new chilled ones? Thanks.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.349
Hey.Hey.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.003
What you doing?

24:00.047 --> 24:01.396
You seen this show?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.050
These Brits
really know how to bake.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.182
Hence the title.Hmm.

24:05.226 --> 24:06.880
I really get it now.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.623
Do we have any burritos?

24:10.666 --> 24:13.277
I want to take a big bite out
of the side of a burrito

24:13.321 --> 24:15.497
just like fake Justin Bieber.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.672
I have peanut butter.

24:16.716 --> 24:19.893
Mmm. Okay, second-best. Thanks.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.812
Oh. That's so good.

24:25.855 --> 24:28.597
You're the best, Josh Chan.

24:28.641 --> 24:31.121
Aw.

24:36.170 --> 24:39.913
Hey, do you want
a shoulder rub?

24:49.139 --> 24:51.228
Okay, time for you
to go to bed.

24:51.272 --> 24:53.100
You know, sleep?Mm.

24:53.143 --> 24:54.318
Think back to 1983.

24:54.362 --> 24:56.407
Remember how much
you loved that nap?

24:56.451 --> 24:58.540
It is not time for bed.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.760
And stop staring at me.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.239
Well, it's hard,

25:02.283 --> 25:04.372
because you look like you
just crawled out of a grave,

25:04.415 --> 25:07.027
and that is visually
intriguing always.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.290
Okay, I just have to get
through this section here,

25:09.333 --> 25:11.074
and then I will sleep.

25:11.118 --> 25:13.773
And tomorrow, first thing,
we're going to the doctor.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.339
No. No way.

25:15.383 --> 25:16.471
Yes way.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.082
You got to take care
of yourself, Paula.

25:19.126 --> 25:21.781
My God, so oily.

25:21.824 --> 25:25.262
Yeah, don't go
anywhere near an open flame.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.180
Oh, you're great at this.

25:30.224 --> 25:33.270
You know how to do this
because you were a theater girl

25:33.314 --> 25:35.882
and they do massage circles.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.840
George told me that.

25:37.884 --> 25:42.236
Wait, you think of me
as a theater girl?

25:42.279 --> 25:44.238
For real?

25:44.281 --> 25:48.024
Yeah, I guess so.

25:48.068 --> 25:51.985
Um, so, like,
if I were in A Chorus Line,

25:52.028 --> 25:56.511
do you think I would be
Sheila, Cassie or Maggie?

25:57.512 --> 26:00.602
Uh, I don't know,

26:00.646 --> 26:03.910
but I think we should stop.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.781
Why?Uh, because we're roommates

26:05.825 --> 26:09.829
and things, and we should
definitely not have...

26:09.872 --> 26:11.265
Or should we?

26:11.308 --> 26:12.483
Take me, Zach.

26:12.527 --> 26:14.007
Wait. Wait, who's Zach?He's the director

26:14.050 --> 26:15.443
in A Chorus Line
and runs the auditions,

26:15.486 --> 26:17.271
and some productions
have him just be a voice,

26:17.314 --> 26:18.925
but others cast
an actual actor.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.317
Okay...

26:22.363 --> 26:23.973
Wait. Okay, no.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.932
No. Okay. Okay,
you're-you're drunk.

26:25.975 --> 26:27.281
You've been drinking.

26:27.324 --> 26:28.412
What?Okay? You must
have had, like,

26:28.456 --> 26:29.979
three drinks tonight.

26:30.023 --> 26:32.547
Okay, you know you can't drink
like that. You're Jewish.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.639
We shouldn't do this.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.599
Josh, I'm sorry.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.426
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

26:42.470 --> 26:45.429
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.780
Are you okay?

26:49.825 --> 26:52.393
I don't know.

26:55.439 --> 26:58.442
I don't know.

27:00.444 --> 27:02.446
But...

27:04.448 --> 27:07.451
...there's somewhere
that I need to go.

Rebecca?

30:20.906 --> 30:23.473
Hi, Dr. Shin.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.388
How are you?

30:25.432 --> 30:27.303
I'm doing very well,
as you can see.

30:27.347 --> 30:29.262
Mm.

30:29.305 --> 30:30.306
Should we...?

30:30.350 --> 30:32.134
Yeah, let's go.Yeah.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.531
Okay.

30:37.574 --> 30:38.619
Yeah.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.537
Am I the first person
to sleep on that bench?

30:43.580 --> 30:44.843
Absolutely not.That tracks.

30:50.457 --> 30:52.285
I... stopped doing
any of the work

30:52.328 --> 30:54.287
that I needed to do.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.375
I had a feeling.

30:55.418 --> 30:57.420
We've been missing you at group.

30:57.464 --> 31:01.207
I was just so happy
for a second, and...

31:01.250 --> 31:04.471
I legit thought I
could get away with

31:04.514 --> 31:07.082
not doing any
of the stuff.

31:07.126 --> 31:08.388
I understand.
It's like I
did squats

31:08.431 --> 31:10.738
every day for a year,

31:10.781 --> 31:12.566
and now I just want
to eat doughnuts

31:12.609 --> 31:15.482
for the rest of my life and
never go back to the gym

31:15.525 --> 31:18.746
but still have a great
butt forever, you know?Yeah.

31:18.789 --> 31:21.488
I do know. I work out
my butt three times a week.

31:21.531 --> 31:22.968
You think I like squats?

31:23.011 --> 31:25.057
I was just tired.

31:25.100 --> 31:27.450
Honestly, the whole
thing is so relentless,

31:27.494 --> 31:30.236
and I threw myself into the
high of the new relationship,

31:30.279 --> 31:32.368
and I stopped doing
any of the work.

31:32.412 --> 31:34.631
And then we
fought a lot,

31:34.675 --> 31:37.417
and then I had, like,
a billion drinks...

31:37.460 --> 31:38.679
A billion?

31:38.722 --> 31:41.421
Three.Yeah. Great. Lehayim.

31:41.464 --> 31:42.944
Right.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.425
And then...

31:45.468 --> 31:46.992
I tried to have sex

31:47.035 --> 31:49.298
with both Nathaniel and Josh,
who I now live with,

31:49.342 --> 31:50.517
by the way.Wow.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.823
You have not been
to group in a while.

31:52.867 --> 31:55.000
Yeah. Yeah, no, exactly.
It's bad, it's bad.

31:55.043 --> 31:56.958
God, I feel bad.
I just feel terrible.

31:57.002 --> 32:00.005
But I know what I have
to do-- I got to go back
into all the therapy.

32:00.048 --> 32:01.615
Yeah, no.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.312
That's what I'm
gonna do. I promise.

32:03.356 --> 32:05.749
I promise. I've
done it all before.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.447
I'll do it all again.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.318
Rebecca...No, don't.

32:09.362 --> 32:11.494
You know what I'm gonna say.No. Please?

32:11.538 --> 32:12.931
We need to talk
about medication.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.374
Well, here it is,
here we are.

32:21.417 --> 32:23.550
The time we've all
been waiting for.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.682
Press "play"
on the old menopause.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.684
Oh, exciting!

32:27.728 --> 32:30.078
Okay, let's do this.

32:30.122 --> 32:33.342
Are we doing a patch,
a pill, sticking
something up my butt?

32:33.386 --> 32:37.477
Whatever is fast and easy,
'cause I have stuff to do.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.782
First tell me your symptoms.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.741
I like to start by
hearing the symptoms.

32:40.784 --> 32:43.048
I'm a funny kind of
gynecologist that way.

32:43.091 --> 32:46.007
Okay, I'm hot.
Like, on fire.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.140
I am exhausted.

32:48.183 --> 32:51.578
I am achy all over,
but especially my arms.

32:51.621 --> 32:54.581
And-and this morning I even
threw up a little bit.

32:54.624 --> 32:55.930
What did the vomit look like?

32:55.974 --> 33:00.587
Um, kinda weird.
Kinda white and milky.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.023
Interesting.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.243
Well, I'll tell you what,
it is possible that

33:04.286 --> 33:05.592
you're starting to go
through menopause,

33:05.635 --> 33:08.464
but I think you're also
having a heart attack.

33:08.508 --> 33:09.552
Ha ha.

33:09.596 --> 33:11.815
Nope, not ha ha.
Not a "ha ha" thing.

33:11.859 --> 33:15.210
I have a patient who needs to go
to cardiac ICU immediately.

33:15.254 --> 33:17.125
Wait, what? ICU?

33:17.169 --> 33:20.302
N-No, I-I can't go there now.
I got stuff to do.

33:20.346 --> 33:23.436
Cool, then put "dropping dead"
on your to-do list for today.

33:26.091 --> 33:29.529
No, don't take out the pad.
What are you doing?

33:29.572 --> 33:31.313
These will not turn you
into a vegetable or zombie.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.620
They're just gonna work with
your existing brain chemicals.

33:33.663 --> 33:38.233
Now, there is Citalopram,
Escitalopram, Paroxetine,

33:38.277 --> 33:41.932
Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine
and Sertraline.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.717
I have one that I think
will be good for you.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.676
Oh, can you just stop writing?
There's so much writing.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.461
Most people who have
what you have

33:48.504 --> 33:51.029
manage their symptoms
with a combination

33:51.072 --> 33:52.595
of therapy and medication.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.423
I...You have toughed it out

33:54.467 --> 33:56.860
for a long time
on your own here.

33:56.904 --> 33:59.559
And you don't have to.

33:59.602 --> 34:03.215
I can't make you do anything,
but this is what I recommend.

34:03.258 --> 34:06.783
Okay, I appreciate
the recommendation.

34:06.827 --> 34:12.615
Dr. Shin, I acted
like such a horrible witch

34:12.659 --> 34:13.921
to Greg yesterday.

34:13.964 --> 34:15.227
What do I do?

34:15.270 --> 34:17.403
What do I say to him?You know how to do this.

34:17.446 --> 34:20.449
You know how to take
responsibility for stuff.

34:20.493 --> 34:23.670
Okay. No, you're right, I do.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.585
I'm gonna call him and own up

34:25.628 --> 34:27.674
to everything that
happened last night,

34:27.717 --> 34:31.025
and all of the stuff I did.

34:31.069 --> 34:34.594
And it's gonna suck, and
he's gonna be upset, and...

34:36.204 --> 34:37.684
Oh, God, this might be him.

34:37.727 --> 34:39.512
Let me just get
it over with.

34:41.949 --> 34:44.473
Oh, it's not him, it's Scott.

34:44.517 --> 34:46.040
It's Paula's husband.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.868
That's weird. Why would
he be calling me?

34:47.911 --> 34:49.913
Hello?

34:52.568 --> 34:53.874
Oh, my God.

35:01.882 --> 35:05.451
Is she gonna be okay?

35:05.494 --> 35:07.061
She had a major blockage,

35:07.105 --> 35:10.456
and walked around
with it for 18 hours.

35:10.499 --> 35:13.241
Wow.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.983
Mm, because, uh,
my lady is a badass,

35:16.026 --> 35:19.117
and, uh, really,
really stupid.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.512
Did you go to
Ragin Waters recently?

35:23.556 --> 35:25.558
Yeah. How did you know?

35:25.601 --> 35:28.343
You smell like day-old chlorine
and chili cheese dogs.

35:33.522 --> 35:35.872
God, I just--
I love her so much.

35:37.613 --> 35:39.789
Me, too.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.052
So much.

35:44.185 --> 35:46.013
God, when is the doctor
gonna get here?

35:48.189 --> 35:49.799
Hello there.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.366
Is Paula okay?

35:51.410 --> 35:52.672
Yeah, she's doing well.

35:52.715 --> 35:55.631
My God. Thank God.She's incredibly brave.

35:55.675 --> 35:58.199
A lot of patients I have, when
they go under for heart surgery,

35:58.243 --> 35:59.853
they say, "Doc, please
don't let me die."

35:59.896 --> 36:02.551
But with her, she said, "Doc,
you have parsley in your teeth,"

36:02.595 --> 36:04.162
and, "How long is
this gonna take?"

36:04.205 --> 36:07.469
Oh, God. Thank God.

36:07.513 --> 36:10.472
Oh, actually, I know you.
He's very funny.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.257
You're the-the funny doctor.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.693
Dr. Roth.

36:13.736 --> 36:16.130
You were my doctor
when I had a UTI.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.567
Oh, no, you're thinking
of my brother, Dr. Roth.

36:18.611 --> 36:19.699
Uh, I'm Dr. Roth.

36:19.742 --> 36:22.310
I'm sorry about him.
Dr. Roth, I mean.

36:22.354 --> 36:23.355
Dr. Roth.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.922
Dr. Roth, Dr. Roth.

36:25.966 --> 36:27.054
What are you laughing at?

36:29.709 --> 36:31.885
Uh, when can we see her?

36:31.928 --> 36:34.235
Oh, you can go in now, but
one visitor at a time, please.

36:34.279 --> 36:37.107
REBECCA: You go first,
and then I'll go.

36:39.893 --> 36:42.678
I am glad you're okay.

36:42.722 --> 36:46.204
Yeah, me, too.

36:46.247 --> 36:49.468
Paula, what were you doing?

36:49.511 --> 36:54.342
You walked around being so sick
for so many hours,

36:54.386 --> 36:56.257
toughing it out on your own.

36:56.301 --> 36:58.085
You know you don't have
to do that.

36:58.128 --> 37:01.262
I just-- I didn't have
time to be sick.

37:01.306 --> 37:04.613
Okay, no one has time
to be sick.

37:04.657 --> 37:07.007
But you have to take
better care of yourself.

37:07.050 --> 37:09.749
I know that now.

37:09.792 --> 37:12.012
Promise me that you will
do everything

37:12.055 --> 37:13.492
the doctors want you to do.

37:13.535 --> 37:18.061
Um, yeah, but they don't
wantme to do anything.

37:18.105 --> 37:19.628
They just want me to lie
here for a couple days.

37:19.672 --> 37:23.632
And it's-it's not just
a onetime thing.

37:23.676 --> 37:28.246
They're saying I gotta take
better care of myself for life.

37:28.289 --> 37:30.639
Like salads.

37:30.683 --> 37:34.295
He used the word
"salads," Rebecca.

37:34.339 --> 37:37.255
Without the word "potato"
in front of it.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.431
I mean, I'm not gonna lie,
that sounds awful.

37:39.474 --> 37:42.825
I mean, salads are just piles
of sandwich with no bread.

37:42.869 --> 37:45.263
Hey, listen,
take the word "salad,"

37:45.306 --> 37:47.743
rearrange some letters,
add a couple of other letters,

37:47.787 --> 37:50.311
you get "Satan." Okay?

37:50.355 --> 37:53.749
It's not great...
but you have to do

37:53.793 --> 37:55.403
what they want you to do.

37:55.447 --> 38:01.322
Okay, even if it is tough
and tiring and exhausting...

38:01.366 --> 38:02.715
like a salad.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.848
Because, also,
like a salad,

38:05.892 --> 38:09.504
there are croutons and
bacon bits to look forward to.

38:09.548 --> 38:12.115
Ooh, bacon bits.

38:12.159 --> 38:16.294
Yay.

38:16.337 --> 38:19.297
Promise me you'll take
better care of yourself.

38:21.386 --> 38:22.952
I will.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.566
Okay.
