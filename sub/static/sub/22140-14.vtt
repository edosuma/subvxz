Nana Jean sent us
on a rock hunt.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.460
And we found
this great throwing rock.

18:28.460 --> 18:31.540
Then we shattered
Janine's car window.

18:31.540 --> 18:33.170
Kind of by accident?

18:33.170 --> 18:35.290
I didn't think
I'd throw it that far.

18:35.290 --> 18:36.920
Nana Jean says
we have to be honest

18:36.920 --> 18:38.290
and take the consequences.

18:38.290 --> 18:39.830
Oh, she does?

18:39.830 --> 18:42.080
Ruby, one of these kids
shattered my window.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.460
The little Asian boy
did it.

18:43.460 --> 18:45.420
Face your consequences,
kid.

18:45.420 --> 18:46.290
Well, then your parents
are gonna have

18:46.290 --> 18:47.710
to write me
a really big check.

18:47.710 --> 18:48.960
I'm gonna make
an example out of you.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.380
J-Janine, wait!

18:50.380 --> 18:51.750
Mason...

18:51.750 --> 18:54.330
Also drew the nipples
on your garden gnomes.

18:54.330 --> 18:56.580
The whole point
is that they're nonsexual!

18:56.580 --> 18:58.960
Oh, you're gonna fry
for this, young man!
Wait!

18:58.960 --> 19:00.040
Bye.
You guys, no!

19:00.040 --> 19:02.000
Nana Jean says
always be loyal!

19:03.880 --> 19:05.170
Grandma.

19:05.170 --> 19:07.120
The way you sold him out?

19:07.120 --> 19:09.670
Psh.
I'm learning from the master.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.290
We're sorry we turned
our backs on you

19:11.290 --> 19:13.790
for exotic food
and off-season crafts.

19:13.790 --> 19:17.170
Oh, I know you are, babies.

19:17.170 --> 19:19.830
Now, how many grandmothers
do you have?

19:19.830 --> 19:20.830
One.
One.

19:20.830 --> 19:22.080
That's right.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.460
Give me a big hug.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.830
Are we still friends
with Mason?

19:25.830 --> 19:29.420
No, baby.

19:29.420 --> 19:31.380
He's dead to you.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.580
Cool.

19:33.580 --> 19:36.290
♪♪

19:36.290 --> 19:37.380
Babe...

19:37.380 --> 19:41.170
taking a step back,
I realize

19:41.170 --> 19:44.580
that we handled our conversation
with Junior poorly.

19:44.580 --> 19:47.170
We were calling him a monster,
and we were the monsters.

19:47.170 --> 19:49.380
We were.

19:49.380 --> 19:53.080
I know I'm supposed to say
that I treat my son

19:53.080 --> 19:55.500
and my daughter,
when it comes to sex, equally,

19:55.500 --> 19:57.420
but I can't.

19:57.420 --> 19:58.920
I thought I could.

19:58.920 --> 20:01.500
Then I heard
that Junior and Megan

20:01.500 --> 20:03.380
broke up
right after they had sex,

20:03.380 --> 20:05.040
and I was brought back
to high school,

20:05.040 --> 20:07.000
where it was
all about reputation.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.250
I called virginity
a "flower."

20:10.250 --> 20:12.380
Oh. Yeah.
You did.
Ugh!

20:12.380 --> 20:14.710
How are we supposed to end
this double standard

20:14.710 --> 20:20.710
if I, one of the most
enlightened people in the world,

20:20.710 --> 20:22.580
still has it?

20:22.580 --> 20:23.710
Okay, babe.

20:23.710 --> 20:25.670
Well, we may not be able

20:25.670 --> 20:28.290
to end the double standard
in the world...
Mm.

20:28.290 --> 20:31.120
...but we could do
a little better in our house.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.580
Mm-hmm.

20:32.580 --> 20:35.420
Say something more to Junior
than "wrap it up."

20:35.420 --> 20:36.420
Yeah.

20:36.420 --> 20:37.750
I'm gonna come with you
this time.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.290
Good call.
Yeah.

20:39.290 --> 20:41.210
'Cause "wrap it up"
was all I had.

20:41.210 --> 20:43.460
We got to be gentle
with Junior.

20:43.460 --> 20:46.750
He just got dumped
by a monster.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.040
-Mm.
-Aah!

20:48.040 --> 20:49.290
I've got to cancel those steaks.

20:54.830 --> 20:56.620
Oh. Hello, Ruby.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.460
Are Jack and Diane home?

20:58.460 --> 20:59.830
It's 10:30.

20:59.830 --> 21:01.000
They're still at school.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.330
Good.

21:02.330 --> 21:04.000
Because I'd hate
to have them see me drag

21:04.000 --> 21:05.670
their grandmother
into the street.

21:05.670 --> 21:07.620
There it is!

21:07.620 --> 21:09.330
I knew it!

21:09.330 --> 21:11.830
You think it's cool
to sell out my grandson

21:11.830 --> 21:13.210
to that sad divorcée?

21:13.210 --> 21:15.880
Then I got bad news
for you.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.210
And I do remember you
from the riots.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.080
I should have taken
the shot.

21:20.080 --> 21:21.580
Come for me, bitch.
