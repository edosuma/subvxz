(eerie chords)

00:06.307 --> 00:07.441
(clicks)

00:07.508 --> 00:13.481
- My lady and gentlemen
look around you.

00:13.547 --> 00:19.153
Behold the great Eias.

00:19.920 --> 00:24.392
- There were two
women and two men

00:24.458 --> 00:26.227
once.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.566
(ominous music)

01:24.518 --> 01:26.620
(tapping)

01:29.457 --> 01:32.393
- [Man] It's nice to
see you again Davis.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.662
How is your new
invention coming along,

01:34.728 --> 01:37.631
the Menzie technology?

01:37.698 --> 01:38.932
Davis?

01:38.999 --> 01:42.836
- Uh work yes, work is,
work is what work is.

01:42.903 --> 01:48.309
(ominous music)

02:04.658 --> 02:06.960
- [Man] In our last session
you said you were planning on

02:07.027 --> 02:09.730
meeting with potential
buyers, have you?

02:09.797 --> 02:14.335
- Yes doc, made a prototype

02:14.402 --> 02:16.737
showed it to distributors
they say it's ground breaking,

02:16.804 --> 02:20.574
change the world, met with
distributors, patent attorney

02:20.641 --> 02:22.176
they all want it.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.746
(ominous music)

02:51.839 --> 02:54.308
(sizzling)
(beeping)

02:54.375 --> 02:57.245
- [Doctor] Davis be careful
what you say and sign in those

02:57.311 --> 03:00.648
meetings, I want
this to work for you.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.851
You are not only my patient
you are my best friend

03:03.917 --> 03:05.453
and I mean that.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.856
- Yes doctor I know
I appreciate you,

03:08.922 --> 03:10.724
appreciate you so much.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.794
When the invention sells
you get half the money,

03:13.861 --> 03:16.964
I mean when it sells you
get half, you, me, Daniella

03:17.030 --> 03:19.233

03:19.900 --> 03:22.370
One, two, three.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.774
(ominous music)

03:41.722 --> 03:45.225
(clangs)
(beeping)

03:49.997 --> 03:53.534
(gentle music)

03:55.803 --> 03:59.407
(whooshing)

04:11.752 --> 04:13.321
- So what do you think?

04:13.387 --> 04:14.988
- What do I think about merging

04:15.055 --> 04:16.557
your little distro
company with mine?

04:16.624 --> 04:19.727
- Yeah we'd be a power house.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.562
- I think it sucks.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.664
Marci what do you think?

04:23.731 --> 04:25.833
- I think it sucks.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.100
- You hear that?

04:27.167 --> 04:30.871
Marci thinks it sucks and
do you know why it sucks?

04:30.938 --> 04:33.374
Because you don't
own this Menzie.

04:33.441 --> 04:36.444
You see right there.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.845
Told me everything
I need to know.

04:37.911 --> 04:38.946
- Yeah I, I didn't say anything.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.649
- Oh you said
plenty, a mouthful.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.651
Just didn't open
your mouth to do it.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.387
(ominous music)

04:46.887 --> 04:48.756
(alarm ringing)

04:53.961 --> 04:57.331
- Whoa, who, who are you?

04:59.032 --> 05:02.436
I said who are you?

05:03.136 --> 05:06.039
- Do you like gum balls Antonio?

05:06.106 --> 05:07.541
- Gum balls?

05:07.608 --> 05:12.846
- Yeah gum balls, you know
'em, little round pieces of gum

05:12.913 --> 05:14.848
with a hard shell?

05:16.116 --> 05:16.917
(beeping)

05:16.984 --> 05:20.388
Surely you were a kid once?

05:20.454 --> 05:22.723
These gum balls are special.

05:22.790 --> 05:26.994
They're neon colored,
it's damned hard to
find these things.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.831
I had to buy out
the whole store.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.400
- Gum balls.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.001
What the hell's
she talking about?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.903
Are you crazy?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.538
You're a little crazy right?

05:37.605 --> 05:39.172
- You wanna know what's crazy?

05:39.239 --> 05:42.810
The fucking moon
landing that was crazy.

05:42.876 --> 05:46.013
Well let me ask you something,
you've seen the footage

05:46.079 --> 05:48.682
how did that shit get shot?

05:48.749 --> 05:50.418
How did it get lit?

05:50.484 --> 05:52.085
Was there a film crew
just sitting on the moon

05:52.152 --> 05:53.554
waiting to shoot it?

05:53.621 --> 05:58.926
No we shot it on a God damned
sound stage at Paramount.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.160
- We?

06:00.227 --> 06:02.563
- I was the cinematographer
on that shoot

06:02.630 --> 06:07.167
and the writer, one small
step for man that was me.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.136
What was the other
guy's suggestion?

06:09.202 --> 06:12.773
Honey I'm home.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.652
- What cha hiding?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.520
- Nothing.

06:26.587 --> 06:30.458
- Oh come on, show it to me.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.659
- I don't have anything.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.127
- Show me yours and
I'll show you mine.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.963
Tit for tat.

06:36.029 --> 06:40.100
- Okay this is a little crazy.

06:40.167 --> 06:44.538
- Go ahead Antonio,
show her your tat.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.039
- How do you know my name?

06:46.106 --> 06:49.477
Who are you people?

06:49.543 --> 06:52.813
- [Woman] I'm Harriet,
Harriet Skelp.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.824
- You, you're an assassin?

07:03.891 --> 07:08.596
- Not an assassin
asshole, the assassin.

07:08.662 --> 07:09.930
You'll never find anybody better

07:09.997 --> 07:11.999
I'll tell ya that right now.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.200
- Okay.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.069
(snaps)

07:16.136 --> 07:20.207
And you are?

07:20.273 --> 07:25.813
- Otto Jeter,
pleased to meet ya.

07:25.879 --> 07:31.652
- You know Antonio, you
live your life on instinct,

07:31.719 --> 07:37.825
survival instinct so
here's the quandary

07:37.891 --> 07:41.795
what differentiates
you from a wild animal?

07:41.862 --> 07:46.534
A lion who hunts his food
and takes whatever he wants.

07:46.600 --> 07:50.170
I mean that's what
you are isn't it hmm?

07:50.237 --> 07:54.542
No emotions, no (snaps) thought.

07:54.608 --> 07:59.680
- But you're an assassin.

07:59.747 --> 08:04.184
(laughs)

08:04.251 --> 08:07.054
- Now I like you Antonio.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.690
It doesn't take long to
get a feel for a person

08:09.757 --> 08:13.727
and I can tell you're
a stand up guy.

08:13.794 --> 08:14.795
Am I right?

08:14.862 --> 08:15.963
- Uh I guess.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.231
- As a matter of fact
you get outta this alive

08:18.298 --> 08:20.834
you look me up hmm?

08:20.901 --> 08:23.571
- Why would I--

08:23.637 --> 08:26.306
- You have something
we want Antonio.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.941
We want it now.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.843
- I don't, I--

08:29.910 --> 08:31.278
(bangs)

08:31.344 --> 08:32.713
- How long have
you known me Stu?

08:32.780 --> 08:34.848
What do you think I would
have done had somebody said

08:34.915 --> 08:36.817
my idea sucked?

08:36.884 --> 08:38.586
- Well you would've
punched 'em in the face.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.853
- Punch him in the face.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.321
(laughing)

08:41.388 --> 08:43.591
I like that, I like that no.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.927
I'd straighten my tie, I'd
stand up tall and proud

08:46.994 --> 08:51.198
walk the fuck out
knowing full fucking well

08:51.264 --> 08:53.601
that I would take their entire
miserable little company

08:53.667 --> 08:55.068
over and make it mine.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.871
I will inundate them with
document dumps and paper work

08:57.938 --> 09:00.073
so heavy their legal
fees'll rival OJ's.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.141
- Wow.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.009
- How many inventors
do you think

09:02.075 --> 09:04.344
can handle that kind of expense?

09:04.411 --> 09:06.079
- Not too many.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.080
- Not a one.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.616
- Or not a one.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.719
- They're all toast because I
have balls you can hear clank

09:11.785 --> 09:14.755
when I walk and they
don't, simple as that.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.023
- Wow.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.158
- You believe that?

09:18.225 --> 09:19.026
- Garvin--

09:19.092 --> 09:24.632
- Marci do you believe that?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.936
- Like it's scripture.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.041
(laughs)

09:34.107 --> 09:36.176
- Inside joke, bitch
doesn't believe in God.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.778
- Oh ho.

09:37.845 --> 09:41.949
(laughing)

09:42.015 --> 09:42.683
Garvin.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.051
- How 'bout you Stu?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.152
- What?

09:45.218 --> 09:49.823
- Do you have

09:49.890 --> 09:51.925
(clicking)

09:52.392 --> 09:53.794
huevos to do whatever it takes

09:53.861 --> 09:59.166
to get rid of Davis and bring
me the Menzie technology?

10:02.002 --> 10:06.073
- Thanks for your time, trust
me I'll make this happen,

10:06.139 --> 10:07.908
really.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.342
- Stu.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.111
- Yes?

10:11.178 --> 10:14.047
- Straighten your tie.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.415
Do what it takes.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.184
- Whatever it takes.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.952
- That a boy.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.788
- Yeah.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.626
(laughing)

10:31.398 --> 10:32.866
- Holy fuck.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.838
- Oh you just said a mouthful
and in only two words.

10:37.905 --> 10:42.109
- We want the new technology,
the Menzie technology.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.812
- We can do this the
easy way or the hard way.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.147
(clicking)

10:47.214 --> 10:48.381
(gun firing)

10:48.448 --> 10:50.918
(squishing)

10:56.189 --> 10:57.424
(thuds)

10:57.490 --> 11:00.660
(beeping)

11:02.062 --> 11:04.264
- [Otto] I bet he thought
that was the hard way.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.666
(beeping)

11:15.075 --> 11:16.777
- Hello Margaret.

11:19.546 --> 11:20.814

11:20.881 --> 11:24.785
- Sure, signing out.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.788

we can make a deal.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.438
What are you doing here?

11:45.505 --> 11:46.874
- Nothin'.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.176
- That's what I thought.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.479
For Garvin every minute he
wastes on someone like you

11:52.545 --> 11:55.715
is money he's losin'.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.452
- It's a thought.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.122
Have a good day.

12:08.195 --> 12:12.065
Garvin it'll be a blast

14:39.612 --> 14:43.350
Menzie signed a contract
without reading the fine print.

14:43.416 --> 14:47.554
The Menzie patent is all yours,
Davis is cut completely out

14:47.620 --> 14:49.389
congratulations.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.125
(laughing)

15:05.072 --> 15:07.140
- What are you doing?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.742
- It's too late
Daniella it's too late.

15:09.809 --> 15:12.012
- Tell me what happened.

15:13.646 --> 15:18.418
- I failed you,
Undercoffler the Menzie.

15:18.485 --> 15:21.188
- What about the invention?

15:21.254 --> 15:22.655
(crying)

15:22.722 --> 15:24.391
Davis what about the invention?

15:24.457 --> 15:25.658
- It's gone!

15:25.725 --> 15:27.627
- What do you mean it's gone?

15:27.694 --> 15:30.463
- It's gone, they
took it from me.

15:30.530 --> 15:34.001
Undercoffler they robbed
me, they, they patented it

15:34.067 --> 15:35.668
themselves sold it
to a sub distributor

15:35.735 --> 15:39.272
robbed me patented
sub distributor.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.473
(thudding)

15:40.540 --> 15:43.776
- [Daniella] What are
you talking about?

15:43.843 --> 15:49.349
- It's not mine, it's
not mine anymore it's...

15:52.619 --> 15:55.288
This is your fault.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.756
- Why is it mine?

15:56.823 --> 15:59.259
- You should have been there,
you should have been there

15:59.326 --> 16:02.295
at the meeting you should
have been there to protect me.

16:02.362 --> 16:02.996
- I didn't know--

16:03.063 --> 16:04.164
- You should have!

16:04.231 --> 16:05.265
- No, I--

16:05.332 --> 16:06.733
- How does a man
die, how do I die?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.368
- Don't talk like that.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.403
- Does the temple,
that's blanket show,

16:10.470 --> 16:11.804
that's your department
putting on a show,

16:11.871 --> 16:14.507
some poison get her a knife
in the gut listen first.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.742
- Come here Davis.

16:15.808 --> 16:21.448
- Pills, pills no drama
gets the job done.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.515
I could just take a step.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.017
- Stop it.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.053
- The question is how, the
question is to die, how to die,

16:26.119 --> 16:27.254
how to die, how to die.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.621
Die!

16:28.688 --> 16:31.691
I could put the answers
in a hat and pull them out

16:31.758 --> 16:36.529
we could make it a game show.

16:36.596 --> 16:41.734
That's a good new invention.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.604
Or I could just not think

16:44.671 --> 16:46.406
and do it.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.210
(screams)

16:50.277 --> 16:54.347
(smashing)
(screaming)

16:58.818 --> 17:03.156
- Oh my God. (crying)

17:04.924 --> 17:09.062
(sirens blaring)

17:23.943 --> 17:27.080
(clicking)

17:42.862 --> 17:45.198
(phone ringing)

17:48.468 --> 17:49.669
- Yeah Markowitz.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.570
- [Markowitz] It's not working.

17:50.637 --> 17:51.704
- You what?

17:51.771 --> 17:52.872
- [Markowitz] The Menzie
prototype was stolen

17:52.939 --> 17:55.408
from our lab months
ago and oh Garvin

17:55.475 --> 17:57.677
still hasn't responded to your
takeover offer.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.847
- Tell him that's a joke,
he's got 24 hours to decide

18:00.913 --> 18:03.150
after that it's fair
game on his company

18:03.216 --> 18:04.917
and all it's subsidiaries,

18:04.984 --> 18:07.820
yeah that's what I said.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.557
Son of a bitch.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.824
Hey baby.

18:11.891 --> 18:15.162
(clicks)

18:15.228 --> 18:18.431
Hello doll face.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.699
- Business?

18:19.766 --> 18:22.802
- [Stu] Gotta pay the bills.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.437
- But it's Sunday morning.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.174
- I don't believe in calendars.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.709
- You're obsessed you know that?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.844
Going after Garvin
the way you did,

18:31.911 --> 18:33.680
like it was a vendetta.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.114
- I won didn't I?

18:35.182 --> 18:37.684
And how many people get to
destroy their former mentor

18:37.750 --> 18:39.419
in business huh?

18:39.486 --> 18:42.722
Garvin talked down to
me, he underestimated me,

18:42.789 --> 18:44.557
he paid the price.

18:44.624 --> 18:48.595
- Yeah your mentor
was a grade A dick.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.831
So you been drinkin' or
is that a new cologne?

18:51.898 --> 18:54.367
Eau 'd vodka.

18:58.004 --> 19:01.641
- Hey baby you alright?

19:01.708 --> 19:03.876
- Fine.

19:03.943 --> 19:10.450
- You just seem, you just
seem you know different.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.586
- [Girl] Different than what?

19:13.653 --> 19:16.489
- [Stu] From how you were.

19:16.556 --> 19:19.859
- Oh things change, I don't
even know who you are anymore.

19:19.926 --> 19:23.230
A man killed himself because
of you and you don't even care

19:23.296 --> 19:26.466
and that takes some adjustment.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.440
(clicks)

19:33.506 --> 19:35.542
- [Answering Machine]
One new message.

19:45.218 --> 19:48.788

Terratorra bar in Hollywood.

20:25.792 --> 20:26.826

What're you doing?

20:56.823 --> 21:00.727
- I'm ordering a drink.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.729
- We have a dress code here.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.732
- I'm a giraffe, see?

21:05.798 --> 21:07.066
I even have a tail.

21:07.133 --> 21:11.438
(laughing)

21:11.504 --> 21:13.740
- You know there are
about 200 different jokes

21:13.806 --> 21:15.775
that start like this?

21:15.842 --> 21:17.944

21:18.010 --> 21:19.912
- Misty.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.448
- Fiona Funari.

21:21.514 --> 21:25.452

ask you to leave.

21:25.518 --> 21:30.657
Leave.

21:30.723 --> 21:31.958
- You see this?

21:32.024 --> 21:34.494
This is my friend's ranking book

21:34.561 --> 21:37.930
and each of my friends
is ranked here, in order

21:37.997 --> 21:43.703
and you will never be in this
book, ever, in any position.

21:46.739 --> 21:47.940
Drink please.

21:48.007 --> 21:51.911
- We don't serve giraffes.

21:58.485 --> 22:01.654
What the fuck was that?

22:04.857 --> 22:08.361
(gentle music)

22:28.615 --> 22:31.117
- Hi.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.685
- Hi.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.120
- Drinking alone?

22:34.186 --> 22:39.492
- Oh, I'm a very married man
doll but here have a seat.

22:39.559 --> 22:45.097
- Much obliged (giggles).

22:45.164 --> 22:47.900
- I know you?

22:47.967 --> 22:50.903
- I doubt it, do I know you?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.104
- You might.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.474
- Yeah I might.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.576
- I'm just saying that um
you look, you look familiar.

22:56.643 --> 23:02.148
- No you must have me confused
with someone else entirely.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.151
(spraying)

23:05.217 --> 23:06.986
- Can I get you another beer?

23:07.053 --> 23:07.720
- Please.

23:07.787 --> 23:08.888
- And for the lady?

23:08.955 --> 23:15.562
- Um something warm
and wet (giggles).

23:17.864 --> 23:21.167
- Woo, cancel that beer I gotta
go my wife's waiting for me.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.202
- Are you gonna
come back tomorrow?

23:23.269 --> 23:24.871
- I'm here pretty much everyday.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.238
Here you go baby.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.607
- Well maybe I'll
see you tomorrow.

23:27.674 --> 23:30.610
- Thank for everything.

23:37.917 --> 23:41.921
(snoring)

24:59.298 --> 25:02.935
- Ma'am Casius looks
weak and hungry.

25:03.002 --> 25:07.574
He thinks too much,
such men are dangerous

25:07.640 --> 25:12.511
but I am constant
as the north star.

25:18.184 --> 25:22.989
- You're significantly
crazier than me you know that?

25:23.055 --> 25:26.058
And so are you (laughs).

25:28.828 --> 25:33.065
- Daniella Menzie, the
doctor will see you now.

25:39.138 --> 25:42.308
- [Doctor] So how are ya?

25:42.374 --> 25:44.310
(laughs)

25:44.376 --> 25:46.312
I think last week we ended with

25:46.378 --> 25:51.150
your intense feelings
of vengeance.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.753
- Good memory on
you doc (laughs).

25:53.820 --> 25:55.154
- [Doctor] That's my job.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.025
I believe your feelings had
to do with the loss of your

25:59.091 --> 26:00.126
brother Davis.

26:00.960 --> 26:05.031
- Well not just my
feelings Elle's too.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.899
- [Doctor] Your friend?

26:09.001 --> 26:14.140
- She hates the
man who ruined me.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.142
She's a bad influence.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.647
(laughing)

26:20.713 --> 26:25.785
- [Doctor] Well
tell me about her.

26:25.852 --> 26:33.059
- She has the brightest red
hair, it'll burn your eyes

26:33.125 --> 26:34.894
and she loves horses.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.163
(neighing)

26:37.229 --> 26:39.866
She once told me
that she's an angel

26:39.932 --> 26:43.035
riding the blood red
horse of Armageddon.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.872
(ominous music)

26:47.006 --> 26:48.340
- [Doctor] Now let's
talk about this,

26:48.407 --> 26:50.376
this man who ruined your life.

26:50.442 --> 26:54.180
- No don't ask me about him.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.249
Don't fucking ask me
about him, don't do that!

26:57.316 --> 27:00.152
(ominous music)

27:01.320 --> 27:04.724
Don't ask me, ask Elle.

27:13.365 --> 27:24.076
- Daniella, the pursuit of
vengeance is understandable.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.052
(sniffs)

27:40.092 --> 27:43.095
(eerie music)

27:51.337 --> 27:52.739
- Where you headed?

27:52.805 --> 27:54.741
- Just grab a couple drinks.

27:54.807 --> 27:57.176
Phase out business
a bit you know.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.211
- And what are you hopin'
to find at this bar?

27:59.278 --> 28:01.347
- Maybe some friends.

28:01.413 --> 28:02.514
- Friends?

28:02.581 --> 28:04.884
- You know I've been thinkin',

28:04.951 --> 28:10.923
I'm not sure I've ever had
any real friends boo hoo.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.836
Love that perfume.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.437
- What about the
rest of me? (laughs)

28:25.504 --> 28:29.008
- Oh baby I like all of you.

28:41.587 --> 28:45.057
(dramatic music)

29:03.142 --> 29:08.280
Ah what'd ya say your
name was last night?

29:08.347 --> 29:09.515
- I didn't.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.017
(laughs)

29:11.083 --> 29:12.218
- Stu!

29:12.284 --> 29:17.156
- Frieda, Frieda, ah
I'd like you to meet my,

29:17.223 --> 29:21.360
my new chair (laughs).

29:21.427 --> 29:23.262
Sorry (laughing).

29:23.329 --> 29:26.065
- I hope you and your new chair

29:26.132 --> 29:28.367
are very fucking happy together.

29:28.434 --> 29:32.271
- Frieda, Frieda (laughing).

29:40.246 --> 29:42.081
This is hell.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.389
(slams)

30:02.601 --> 30:05.204
Wait stop Frieda!

30:05.271 --> 30:06.873
Baby honey.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.008
I didn't do anything.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.442
I was just talkin' to her.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.511
- I know about your little
bathroom adventure with that

30:12.578 --> 30:14.113
liquor store promotion slut.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.347
- What?

30:15.414 --> 30:16.115
- Why do you think I
started following you

30:16.182 --> 30:18.417
to the bar to begin with?

30:18.484 --> 30:20.152
Insurance.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.088
- And it worked.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.323
Baby I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.025
It was a joke.

30:26.492 --> 30:31.463
Frieda, Frieda talk to me.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.299
Frieda.

30:33.365 --> 30:36.903
- Talk to yourself.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.205
- Frieda look would I,
would I really wanna--

30:39.271 --> 30:40.973
(smacks)

30:47.346 --> 30:48.547
- See this?

30:48.614 --> 30:53.953
This is my new look
now i.e. not your wife.

30:54.020 --> 30:54.686
- Not a good look.

30:54.753 --> 30:58.057
Frieda baby wait Frieda!

31:09.135 --> 31:10.202
Frieda!

31:10.269 --> 31:12.304
Frieda!

31:17.709 --> 31:19.078
Baby come back.

31:19.145 --> 31:22.348
- That sick bastard got some
dark bullshit in your head

31:22.414 --> 31:23.449
and infected you with it.

31:23.515 --> 31:24.883
- What, what're
you talking about?

31:24.951 --> 31:28.087
- Everything around you got
worse and worse and worse

31:28.154 --> 31:31.623
once you got that
thing, that Menzie.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.359
- That's a gross exaggeration.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.227
- Is it now?

31:35.294 --> 31:38.530
You don't have a moral
cell left in your body.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.200
- Oh fuck you Frieda.

31:44.770 --> 31:48.007
(laughing)

31:50.042 --> 31:52.278

(gasping)

31:52.344 --> 31:53.379
(smashing)

31:53.445 --> 31:55.381
Frieda!

32:04.390 --> 32:06.492
Oh my God (crying).

32:44.763 --> 32:46.398
- Don't you think
you've had enough.

32:46.465 --> 32:50.569
- Oh please, haven't even.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.271

32:54.340 --> 32:55.741
(laughing)

32:55.807 --> 32:59.111

wakey, wakey eggs and bacey.

32:59.178 --> 33:02.081
- Oh no, no, no the
expression is wakey, wakey

33:02.148 --> 33:03.715
hands off snakey.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.184
- Which is a subject you
would know all about.

33:05.251 --> 33:07.586
- Well if you wanna do it
right you gotta do it yourself

33:07.653 --> 33:09.821
sometime alright.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.790
- How 'bout I call you a cab?

33:11.857 --> 33:13.425
- You're a cab.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.461
- What?

33:15.527 --> 33:17.063
- Nothing bad joke.

33:17.129 --> 33:21.133
Now I need a beer.

33:23.902 --> 33:25.171

33:25.237 --> 33:28.740
- That's water (laughs).

your company wouldn't we?

33:40.419 --> 33:42.654
- Come on.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.424
- Thank you.

33:45.491 --> 33:50.096
Give me just a minute.

33:50.162 --> 33:54.633
My friends have
requested my presence.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.568
- Oh!

33:56.635 --> 33:57.636
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

- Well, well we have an
agreement here see nobody here

34:19.291 --> 34:21.893

each other's past.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.028
- No we live in the present.

34:23.095 --> 34:25.664
- Well what if your
present is shit?

34:25.731 --> 34:28.567
- It doesn't matter because
in a few minutes the present

34:28.634 --> 34:29.801
will be the past.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.704
- [Stu] The present will
be the past, I like that.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.072

34:43.715 --> 34:45.184
- [Mark] Ah Stu okay.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.418
- You know what Mark maybe you

34:46.485 --> 34:48.620
should invite Stu to your show.

34:48.687 --> 34:49.588
- That's a good idea.

34:49.655 --> 34:50.556
- What show?

34:50.622 --> 34:51.423
You a stand up?

34:51.490 --> 34:52.624

34:52.691 --> 34:54.460
- You've never heard

34:54.526 --> 34:55.461

34:55.527 --> 34:56.228

34:56.295 --> 34:57.563

36:00.859 --> 36:04.796
- Are you scared?

36:04.863 --> 36:07.533
- Yes.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.001
- Of what?

36:10.068 --> 36:13.839
- Judgement.

36:13.905 --> 36:17.008
Accounting for what I've done.

36:17.075 --> 36:19.878
But I'm not that man

36:26.985 --> 36:30.456
- Ay come on.

36:32.891 --> 36:37.263
I love you, goodnight.

36:39.831 --> 36:43.735
(eerie music)

37:45.564 --> 37:48.367
Pink socks?

38:08.687 --> 38:10.856
(tires squealing)

38:15.026 --> 38:18.397
(gentle music)

38:25.170 --> 38:26.805
- Cognac please.

38:26.872 --> 38:30.442
- Merry Christmas, ho, ho, ho.

38:42.454 --> 38:45.957
- Burying old memories?

38:46.024 --> 38:48.126
Or toasting new ones?

38:48.193 --> 38:52.464
(laughing)

38:52.531 --> 38:55.567
- A little from column a,
a little from column b.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.637
- Well then cheers

39:00.606 --> 39:02.708
- Salute.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.580

39:11.783 --> 39:15.687
Oh baby oh why?

- Why what?

39:16.888 --> 39:18.824

39:18.890 --> 39:21.092
Why tonight?

39:21.159 --> 39:26.965
- Why do you think?

39:27.032 --> 39:29.635
(laughing)

39:37.876 --> 39:40.178
Now's the time where you
come up with an excuse.

39:40.245 --> 39:41.613
- What?

39:41.680 --> 39:44.115
- Why I have to leave, like
work early in the morning

39:44.182 --> 39:45.651
or something like that.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.786
(laughs)

39:47.853 --> 39:49.921
- No excuses.

39:49.988 --> 39:54.760
I might have done that
10 years ago but not now.

39:59.531 --> 40:01.867
- Mind if I smoke?

40:01.933 --> 40:04.002
- No.

40:13.745 --> 40:18.984
- My name is Jenna Funari
and I like to fumari.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.926
Are you okay?

40:27.993 --> 40:30.228
- No I'm okay.

40:30.295 --> 40:32.898
My wife died six months
ago and I still feel funny

40:32.964 --> 40:36.468
whenever I meet somebody.

40:40.972 --> 40:43.842
(dramatic chord)

41:22.013 --> 41:27.318
- Fiona, I'm home.

41:27.385 --> 41:29.855
- Where have you been sis?

41:29.921 --> 41:33.925
You can tell me, I'm
royalty now (giggles).

41:33.992 --> 41:38.897
- Out I went out.

41:38.964 --> 41:42.033
- Did you do it?

41:49.675 --> 41:52.611
- I've been working on
my friend rankings now

41:52.678 --> 41:54.880
and I docked Holly two
points for being a rude cunt

41:54.946 --> 41:57.783
the other day,
what do you think?

41:57.849 --> 42:00.118
- I think I gotta go to bed.

42:00.185 --> 42:04.122
We'll talk about
this later okay?

42:04.189 --> 42:06.524
- [Fiona] Love ya sis.

42:11.162 --> 42:15.033
(ominous music)

42:56.708 --> 42:58.810
(toy train whistle blowing)

43:06.117 --> 43:09.755
- Oh shit, I'll be right back.

43:16.962 --> 43:17.963
Stu what's up?

43:18.029 --> 43:20.666
- Hi Mark I think,
I think, I think,

43:20.732 --> 43:22.167
I think I'm losing my mind.

43:22.233 --> 43:27.673
- Here come in come on.

43:28.439 --> 43:32.043
Honey can you get Stu
some pomegranate juice?

43:32.110 --> 43:33.945
- Yeah.

43:34.012 --> 43:35.346
- Hey let's go relax
in the other room.

43:35.413 --> 43:39.384
You'll be alright.

43:39.450 --> 43:40.385
What's going on?

43:40.451 --> 43:42.220
- Oh Mark.

43:42.287 --> 43:47.092
I think that in that big
house by myself I think I'm

43:47.158 --> 43:50.962
being stalked.

43:51.029 --> 43:55.734
I hear voices late at night, I
find packages on my doorstep.

43:55.801 --> 43:58.369
I need to talk to someone.

43:58.436 --> 44:02.407
- Hey, hey that's
what we're here for.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.743
Being alone is rarely a solution

44:04.810 --> 44:09.114
and I'm sure you're
not being stalked.

44:09.180 --> 44:10.782
- I guess you're right.

44:10.849 --> 44:12.984
My whole life I've never
been physically alone

44:13.051 --> 44:18.256
but I guess emotionally
I've always been alone.

44:18.323 --> 44:21.059
- Well sometimes in life the
right people come at the right

44:21.126 --> 44:27.665
time what you can't
always do is go it alone.

44:30.201 --> 44:33.104
- Mark is God punishing me?

44:36.207 --> 44:37.308
Thank you.

44:37.375 --> 44:40.011
I don't deserve
friends like you guys.

44:40.078 --> 44:44.015
- I think you deserve
whatever you get.

44:44.082 --> 44:47.819
- Um hey why don't I call
up the guys Brett and Byron

44:47.886 --> 44:51.156
we'll have a little impromptu
dinner party so to speak?

44:51.222 --> 44:53.258
- I like Brett.

44:54.092 --> 44:55.460
- Got some models.

44:55.526 --> 44:58.830
Fans of the band probably
could get 'em to come over.

44:58.897 --> 45:00.165
Come on Stu these
girls look so hot

45:00.231 --> 45:01.432
they'll make your teeth sweat.

45:01.499 --> 45:03.234
(laughing)

45:03.301 --> 45:04.803
There we go now we're see?

45:04.870 --> 45:05.871
Now we're talkin'.

45:05.937 --> 45:06.938
Do you hear this guy?

45:07.005 --> 45:08.339
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

45:08.406 --> 45:10.441
- Try puttin' a little more
orange juice in that glass buddy

45:10.508 --> 45:11.609
that's what I would suggest.

45:11.676 --> 45:13.511
- There's no orange juice
in this glass Byron.

45:13.578 --> 45:14.545
- My point exactly.

45:14.612 --> 45:16.047
(laughing)

45:16.114 --> 45:19.985
Listen to this, how 'bout this
I bet you 200 dollars okay?

45:20.051 --> 45:22.788
I bet you I can move one arm
in one circular direction

45:22.854 --> 45:25.190
the other in the
opposite simultaneously.

45:25.256 --> 45:26.457
- No you can't.

45:26.524 --> 45:27.192
- [Brett] Yes you can.

45:27.258 --> 45:28.693
- That's impossible.

45:28.760 --> 45:30.962
- No it's easy just use two
different sides of your brain

45:31.029 --> 45:31.830
don't bet.

45:31.897 --> 45:32.998
- Yeah what are you laughing at?

45:33.064 --> 45:33.765
Two brains.

45:33.832 --> 45:35.166
- You hear that babe?

45:35.233 --> 45:35.967
Looks like we might be able
to afford that addition

45:36.034 --> 45:36.868
to the house after all.

45:36.935 --> 45:38.937
- Yeah I've heard that before.

45:39.004 --> 45:40.505
- Well maybe he's
serious this time.

45:40.571 --> 45:42.140
Who's sayin' he's not?

45:42.207 --> 45:43.975
- I am.

45:44.910 --> 45:48.479
- Trouble on the old home front?

45:48.546 --> 45:51.149
- Whole kids thing, still.

45:51.216 --> 45:52.450
- You want 'em and she.

45:52.517 --> 45:54.319
- Thinks they have
no decibel level.

45:54.385 --> 45:55.486
- Right.

45:55.553 --> 45:56.888
- And neither do you
two gossip queens.

45:56.955 --> 45:58.156
If you're gonna talk about
somebody behind their back

45:58.223 --> 46:01.359
make sure that they at
least can't hear you.

46:01.426 --> 46:03.028
Us women can hear everything.

46:03.094 --> 46:04.830
- Did she just call us queens?

46:04.896 --> 46:06.331
- Yeah I think she did.

46:06.397 --> 46:08.900
You know these queens aren't
talkin' about you behind your

46:08.967 --> 46:11.369
back Lita they're talking about
you in front of your back.

46:11.436 --> 46:12.603
- Thank you Byron.

46:12.670 --> 46:13.338
- Would you come on
kids we're supposed to

46:13.404 --> 46:15.273
be having some fun.

46:15.340 --> 46:17.876
(yells)

46:17.943 --> 46:21.212
- Ladies, ladies come on in
thank you so much for comin'.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.413
How you doing?

46:22.480 --> 46:23.581
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

46:23.648 --> 46:25.116
This gentleman is Stu
Undercoffler right here,

46:25.183 --> 46:33.091
Brett Parr, Byron Fresnel and
of course my lovely wife Lita.

we're not answering either
way you're gonna hear a beep

52:56.407 --> 52:58.843
and if you're to stupid to know
what to do when that happens

52:58.909 --> 53:01.512
then you don't deserve
to use a phone.

53:01.579 --> 53:03.548
(dramatic chord)

53:12.623 --> 53:16.327
(ominous music)

53:18.863 --> 53:22.500
- It's judgement time.

53:22.567 --> 53:25.970
- Now?

53:26.036 --> 53:28.706
Not when it happened?

53:28.773 --> 53:33.878
I've been working my ass
off to make things right.

53:33.944 --> 53:37.748
- Darkness spreads.

53:40.818 --> 53:43.688
- Mark, oh christ.

53:44.889 --> 53:47.458
(dramatic chord)

53:48.759 --> 53:51.596
- [Man] Go to the house.

53:54.699 --> 53:58.303
With the flashing lights.

54:12.783 --> 54:13.984
- Oh man.

54:14.051 --> 54:16.754
- Mmm, I love grape popsicles.

54:16.821 --> 54:18.723
Don't you?

54:18.789 --> 54:21.326
I always save them for last.

54:21.392 --> 54:23.361
I know my box of
popsicles is not gone

54:23.428 --> 54:28.599
until there's no more grape.

54:28.666 --> 54:32.470
- Who are you?

54:32.537 --> 54:35.039
Who's doin' this to me?

54:35.105 --> 54:37.475
- You want answers?

54:37.542 --> 54:42.279
Hop in, we're
going to the house.

54:56.794 --> 55:00.631
(chaotic music)

55:14.111 --> 55:16.547
This is where you get off.

55:20.117 --> 55:22.019
- Aren't you comin' in?

55:22.086 --> 55:24.889
With me?

55:24.955 --> 55:26.624
- Seriously?

55:26.691 --> 55:33.398
No this journey is
yours, it ends with you.

55:33.464 --> 55:39.437
You are the grape popsicle Stu.

55:53.250 --> 55:58.456
(ominous music)

56:01.892 --> 56:04.762
(laughs)

56:06.964 --> 56:10.635
(ominous music)

56:58.549 --> 57:00.918
(dramatic chord)

57:07.792 --> 57:11.629
- [Girl] Why'd you
do it Stu, why?

57:13.798 --> 57:15.700
- Frieda.

57:16.801 --> 57:19.570
I thought I thought I thought

57:19.637 --> 57:24.509
I thought someone
was coming after me.

57:24.575 --> 57:27.277
I didn't know it was a
girl when I shot her.

57:27.344 --> 57:28.579
How could I?

57:28.646 --> 57:33.283
- [Frieda] No why'd you
rip those people off?

57:33.350 --> 57:36.754
- Oh Frieda.

57:36.821 --> 57:45.630
For you, I did it for you, you
deserved money, a nice home,

57:45.696 --> 57:48.833
you deserved everything and

57:48.899 --> 57:54.605
I did everything I had to
do to, to give it to you.

57:58.075 --> 58:01.478
Because I love you Frieda.

58:02.212 --> 58:05.482
(dramatic chord)

58:05.850 --> 58:08.118
Who are you?

58:08.185 --> 58:14.859
- I'm Elle, I'm here to give
you the pain you deserve.

58:16.994 --> 58:19.196
I'm your mother

58:19.263 --> 58:20.931
- I'm your mother fucking.

58:20.998 --> 58:24.034

58:24.101 --> 58:25.970

58:29.273 --> 58:31.776
My God you.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.510
- [Elle] Me.

58:33.911 --> 58:36.547
(thuds)

58:47.057 --> 58:49.594
(dramatic chord)

59:10.414 --> 59:14.084
- Wakey wakey hands
off snakey right?

59:14.151 --> 59:15.986
Bacey (snaps).

59:16.987 --> 59:19.657
- What's, what's, what's,
what's, what's goin' on?

59:19.724 --> 59:21.626
- You simple fuckin' prick.

59:21.692 --> 59:24.962
You think you're so much fuckin'
smarter than everybody else

59:25.029 --> 59:27.965
turns out you're the
dumbest fuck in the room.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.968
(dramatic chord)

59:43.080 --> 59:44.181
- Mark.

59:44.248 --> 59:46.851
Mark we're friends right?

59:46.917 --> 59:49.219
Brett?

59:49.286 --> 59:51.722
Byron?

59:51.789 --> 59:52.857
I thought, I thought I thought-

59:52.923 --> 59:54.224
- [Mark] You thought what Stu?

59:54.291 --> 59:57.127
- [Stu] I thought
we were friends.

59:57.194 --> 59:59.196
Mark you can't be doin' this.

59:59.263 --> 1:00:01.065
You, a betrayer?

1:00:01.131 --> 1:00:05.002
- [Brett] Oh that's rich
he called you a betrayer.

1:00:05.069 --> 1:00:06.203
- Mark please I thought--

1:00:06.270 --> 1:00:08.305
- Shut up!

1:00:08.372 --> 1:00:13.110
God damn Stu shut the fuck up.

1:00:13.177 --> 1:00:15.179
You think this is all about me?

1:00:15.245 --> 1:00:18.949
Look at these faces each and
every person here has been

1:00:19.016 --> 1:00:28.693
affected by you, Byron's
father, me and Lita, Brett's

1:00:28.759 --> 1:00:34.732
best friend, Janna's parents.

1:00:34.799 --> 1:00:37.101
You fucked 'em all over.

1:00:37.167 --> 1:00:39.036
You and your bullshit company.

1:00:39.103 --> 1:00:42.406
- [Byron] Bullshit
fucking company man.

1:00:42.472 --> 1:00:45.843
- You took from 'em Stu.

1:00:45.910 --> 1:00:48.178
You robbed 'em to get rich
and then you destroyed their

1:00:48.245 --> 1:00:52.917
lives, but not only their lives,

1:00:52.983 --> 1:00:55.920
the lives of
everyone around them.

1:00:55.986 --> 1:01:01.692
I had invested all
my inheritance in the
Menzie technology.

1:01:09.066 --> 1:01:18.242
I believed in Davis, I
was happy, eager and why?

1:01:18.308 --> 1:01:20.745
'Cause you promised Davis's
invention would be distributed

1:01:20.811 --> 1:01:25.850
in every Nat superstore.

1:01:25.916 --> 1:01:29.787
You didn't even have a
contract with them did you?

1:01:35.359 --> 1:01:37.227
- I'm sorry.

1:01:37.294 --> 1:01:43.033
- And Daniella, well let's
just say she's a bit unstable

1:01:43.100 --> 1:01:47.905
on account of you ripping
off her brother's invention.

1:01:47.972 --> 1:01:48.572
- Davis.

1:01:48.638 --> 1:01:49.907
- Davis Menzie.

1:01:49.974 --> 1:01:51.341
- Right.

1:01:51.408 --> 1:01:53.911
- He took a long walk off
a short roof and Daniella--

1:01:53.978 --> 1:01:56.013
- Went batshit
fuckin' crazy Stu.

1:01:56.080 --> 1:02:00.885
- Formed a split personality,
took on the persona of Elle

1:02:00.951 --> 1:02:04.021
looks an awful lot like--

1:02:04.088 --> 1:02:05.222
- My wife.

1:02:05.289 --> 1:02:07.191
- Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding we have a winner.

1:02:07.257 --> 1:02:08.492
(laughing)

1:02:08.558 --> 1:02:10.294
Look am I doing good here?

1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:12.863
Alright.

1:02:12.930 --> 1:02:17.501
- Frieda Eleanor
Undercoffler, Elle.

1:02:17.567 --> 1:02:21.538
- I was loved by everyone.

1:02:21.605 --> 1:02:27.144
Sweet, sweet.

1:02:31.515 --> 1:02:34.418
- So.

1:02:34.484 --> 1:02:38.022
Where do we go from here?

1:02:40.290 --> 1:02:44.094
- [Mark] Now we let you go.

1:02:44.161 --> 1:02:45.529
- Oh thank you.

1:02:45.595 --> 1:02:49.366
- Take this as a lesson that
whatever you do to someone

1:02:49.433 --> 1:02:51.936
will come back to you tenfold.

1:02:52.002 --> 1:02:55.472
Go on with your life
Stu Undercoffler

1:02:55.539 --> 1:02:56.874
but live it differently.

1:02:56.941 --> 1:03:00.210
- Oh thank you Mark.

1:03:00.277 --> 1:03:04.849
- Well you see Mark this is
the part we didn't tell you.

1:03:04.915 --> 1:03:07.985
We are going to kill him.

1:03:08.052 --> 1:03:11.956
- Wait a minute, there's
no lesson if we kill him.

1:03:12.022 --> 1:03:14.191
The deal is we scare
him and that's it.

1:03:14.258 --> 1:03:16.526
- That's easy for you to
say, he didn't fuck up your

1:03:16.593 --> 1:03:20.430
family's life like he did mine,
at least you have a career.

1:03:20.497 --> 1:03:23.934
- No the lesson here we all
have to learn is you don't leave

1:03:24.001 --> 1:03:29.273
people with nothing left to
live for except revenge.

1:03:29.339 --> 1:03:30.240
- No fuck that.

1:03:30.307 --> 1:03:31.408
- Fuck you.

1:03:31.475 --> 1:03:32.776
- Fuck you we're not
God damn animals.

1:03:32.843 --> 1:03:36.013
- Oh yes we are you went
to high school didn't you?

1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:39.249
You studied biology,
there are two families

1:03:39.316 --> 1:03:46.023
humans are animals,
plants are well plants.

1:03:46.090 --> 1:03:48.158
- Uh plants (laughs).

1:03:48.225 --> 1:03:49.359
Is he a plant?

1:03:49.426 --> 1:03:50.327
- Are you a plant?

1:03:50.394 --> 1:03:51.161
- Are you?

1:03:51.228 --> 1:03:52.362
- Are you?

1:03:52.429 --> 1:03:53.864
- [Byron] Shall we water
you instead of kill you?

1:03:53.931 --> 1:03:58.502
- You see we knew all along,
that you didn't have the balls

1:03:58.568 --> 1:04:01.438
to follow through,
you're a dabbler.

1:04:01.505 --> 1:04:02.506
(thuds)

1:04:02.572 --> 1:04:03.540
That's why you're out.

1:04:03.607 --> 1:04:05.009
You have no part anymore.

1:04:05.075 --> 1:04:07.945
- Yeah you're done.

1:04:08.012 --> 1:04:11.515
- And now it's time
for our game show.

1:04:11.581 --> 1:04:15.185
It's called pick how you die.

1:04:15.252 --> 1:04:16.420
(laughing)

1:04:16.486 --> 1:04:17.854
- It's not funny.

1:04:17.922 --> 1:04:20.124
- We have drowning, shooting,
stabbing, strangulation,

1:04:20.190 --> 1:04:23.327
oh and bludgeoning so
put your hand in the hat

1:04:23.393 --> 1:04:27.064
and pick your own death Stu.

1:04:27.131 --> 1:04:28.198
Do it.

1:04:28.265 --> 1:04:29.566
Do it, do it.

1:04:29.633 --> 1:04:31.868
(thuds)
(cries out)

1:04:39.543 --> 1:04:41.378
- Get that, you see that?

1:04:41.445 --> 1:04:43.447
Commitment you fucking pig.

1:04:43.513 --> 1:04:46.350
(thudding)
(crying out)

1:04:52.656 --> 1:04:54.424
- Stop!

1:04:55.492 --> 1:04:57.427
(thuds)

1:04:57.494 --> 1:04:59.997
(yelling)

1:05:00.497 --> 1:05:02.166
- [Byron] We talked about this.

1:05:02.666 --> 1:05:04.268
(cries out)

1:05:04.334 --> 1:05:06.003
(yelling)

1:05:14.044 --> 1:05:16.646
- Fucking son of a bitch.

1:05:16.713 --> 1:05:19.916
(cracking)

1:05:40.637 --> 1:05:44.208
(ominous music)

1:06:06.363 --> 1:06:08.698
- I deserve this.

1:06:08.898 --> 1:06:14.138
- No, you deserve this.

1:06:14.204 --> 1:06:17.207
(thudding)
(crying out)

1:06:25.449 --> 1:06:26.616
- Wait, wait.

1:06:26.683 --> 1:06:27.884
- This is our chance
to make things right.

1:06:27.951 --> 1:06:30.220
- If we do this we'll
be no better than him.

1:06:30.287 --> 1:06:32.389
- We are no better than him.

1:06:32.456 --> 1:06:35.225
He made us this.

1:06:35.292 --> 1:06:36.126
(cries out)

1:06:36.193 --> 1:06:39.629
- [Brett] Daniella was right.

1:06:39.696 --> 1:06:44.734
- I am doc?

1:06:44.801 --> 1:06:48.004
- Yes, yes you are

1:06:52.576 --> 1:06:55.245
Elle.

1:07:03.553 --> 1:07:05.489
- Now fuckin' what?

1:07:06.790 --> 1:07:09.159
- There.

1:07:12.162 --> 1:07:14.164
- Hey, back it up.

1:07:16.833 --> 1:07:20.570
This has to end,
it has to end now.

1:07:21.271 --> 1:07:27.511
Mark run, go to Lita go, go!

1:07:29.579 --> 1:07:31.715
- Are you gonna shoot us all?

1:07:32.282 --> 1:07:34.784
You wouldn't shoot me
now would you lover?

1:07:34.851 --> 1:07:37.521
Dead little Frieda, Elle.

1:07:40.590 --> 1:07:43.427
(dramatic chord)

1:07:55.872 --> 1:07:58.375
(pops)
(splashes)

1:07:58.742 --> 1:08:00.410
(laughs)

1:08:03.213 --> 1:08:06.082
I'm very disappointed
in you Mark.

1:08:14.258 --> 1:08:17.161
- You've all become
what you've become

1:08:18.828 --> 1:08:20.164
but I'm not letting you in.

1:08:20.230 --> 1:08:22.666
- You've become a fucking ass.

1:08:22.732 --> 1:08:24.501
Traitor!

1:08:27.804 --> 1:08:30.574
(dramatic music)

1:08:39.283 --> 1:08:43.520
- You used to have a
better swing than that.

1:08:43.920 --> 1:08:46.323
Jesus Christ oh no
come on come on.

1:08:46.390 --> 1:08:49.259
You think mouth to mouth no?

1:08:52.729 --> 1:08:58.868
I didn't think you hit her
that hard Brett but she's dead.

1:08:58.935 --> 1:09:01.905
Janna's dead, she's dead Brett.

1:09:01.971 --> 1:09:05.209
- It was collateral
damage, isn't it?

1:09:05.275 --> 1:09:08.678
- Yeah it is, I mean she
walked into it, she did.

1:09:08.745 --> 1:09:09.713
- She walked right into it.

1:09:09.779 --> 1:09:10.914
- She did.

1:09:10.980 --> 1:09:13.917
Oh my God.

1:09:13.983 --> 1:09:15.519
- I think we better go.

1:09:15.585 --> 1:09:17.187
- Yeah, yeah.

1:09:18.955 --> 1:09:20.724
- Lita!

1:09:22.559 --> 1:09:24.561
Lita!

1:09:24.894 --> 1:09:27.531
Lita, Lita.

1:09:27.831 --> 1:09:28.898
Lita!

1:09:28.965 --> 1:09:29.999
Come on we gotta go.

1:09:30.066 --> 1:09:31.235
- What?
- Now.

1:09:31.301 --> 1:09:32.369
- What is going on?

1:09:32.436 --> 1:09:33.637
- We gotta make a move.

1:09:33.703 --> 1:09:34.738
- What?

1:09:34.804 --> 1:09:36.506
- We gotta go come on.

1:09:36.573 --> 1:09:37.874
- Go, go where?

1:09:37.941 --> 1:09:39.443
- Anywhere, anywhere but here.

1:09:39.509 --> 1:09:41.311
- That's what we
have to worry about.

1:09:41.378 --> 1:09:42.779
- We don't have to
worry about anything.

1:09:42.846 --> 1:09:45.849
Nobody knows,
nobody has to know.

1:09:45.915 --> 1:09:49.853
It's his fault if it wasn't.

1:09:49.919 --> 1:09:51.988
- You finally made
it out I was worried

1:09:52.055 --> 1:09:54.023
I was creating scenarios.

1:09:54.090 --> 1:09:56.526
What happened?

1:09:56.593 --> 1:09:57.594
- He's dead.

1:09:57.661 --> 1:09:58.995
- Oh thank God.

1:09:59.062 --> 1:10:00.464
- Yeah he.

1:10:00.530 --> 1:10:01.598
- Where's Jenna?

1:10:01.665 --> 1:10:02.566
Where's Jenna?

1:10:02.632 --> 1:10:04.868
- Well.

1:10:04.934 --> 1:10:05.902
- Where's my sister?

1:10:05.969 --> 1:10:06.970
- It's bad news.

1:10:07.036 --> 1:10:08.438
Yeah.

1:10:08.505 --> 1:10:11.441
It's Mark he lost control.

1:10:11.508 --> 1:10:14.744
Mark. He killed her,
and I tried to stop him.

1:10:14.811 --> 1:10:16.112
- He tried, he's a fuckin' hero.

1:10:16.179 --> 1:10:18.282
I'm tellin' ya he's like
Douglas Mc fucking Carther

1:10:18.348 --> 1:10:19.148
this guy right here.

1:10:19.215 --> 1:10:20.083
- Alright no, that's enough.

1:10:20.149 --> 1:10:21.418
- You were though, but you are.

1:10:21.485 --> 1:10:22.051
- Please.

1:10:22.118 --> 1:10:22.752
- He is and Mark.

1:10:22.819 --> 1:10:24.621
- But he just ran.

1:10:24.688 --> 1:10:25.755
- No he tried.

1:10:25.822 --> 1:10:26.956
- I saw him right over there.

1:10:27.023 --> 1:10:28.625
- Where is he Byron?

1:10:28.692 --> 1:10:29.693
- [Fiona] Oh my God.

1:10:29.759 --> 1:10:32.061
- What?

1:10:32.128 --> 1:10:34.931
- He's off my friend
list completely.

1:10:34.998 --> 1:10:36.666
- Okay.

1:10:38.502 --> 1:10:39.969
It's okay.

1:10:40.036 --> 1:10:41.805
Good, good.

1:10:41.871 --> 1:10:42.739
(screeches)

1:10:42.806 --> 1:10:45.409
- Shh, shh.

1:10:45.475 --> 1:10:50.514
Alright whatever happens keep
your head down follow my lead.

1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:53.483
- I am not going anywhere until
you tell me what's going on.

1:10:53.550 --> 1:10:57.721
- Okay fine we went after
Stu and took it too far okay?

1:10:57.787 --> 1:10:59.356
And now they're after me.

1:11:03.460 --> 1:11:06.363
But I'm not gonna
let them infect you.

1:11:06.896 --> 1:11:08.532
Come on.

1:11:16.105 --> 1:11:18.908
(eerie music)

1:11:19.609 --> 1:11:21.478
- And why, why
that had to happen.

1:11:21.545 --> 1:11:24.614
We had everything
all ready to go.

1:11:27.484 --> 1:11:29.786
There he is I'm gonna kill you.

1:11:31.521 --> 1:11:32.989
You can't trust this man.

1:11:33.056 --> 1:11:34.257
- Get the fuck away from us.

1:11:34.324 --> 1:11:40.764
- You, you it's your
fault I could kill you.

1:11:40.830 --> 1:11:42.732
You know what you did.

1:11:42.799 --> 1:11:44.100
- Look who's talking.

1:11:44.167 --> 1:11:47.437
- Hey this guy's
fucking God okay.

1:11:47.504 --> 1:11:51.541
- You ruined, we had
everything worked out.

1:11:51.608 --> 1:11:53.443
- Come, come, come on come on.

1:11:53.510 --> 1:11:57.313
- You can't trust that man.

1:11:59.749 --> 1:12:01.985
- [Fiona] Where the
fuck are you goin'?

1:12:02.051 --> 1:12:03.653
- Oh shit.

1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:04.253
(screaming)

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:06.022
Get her out.

1:12:06.723 --> 1:12:09.393
Get her out get off me

1:12:09.459 --> 1:12:11.495
(horn beeping)

1:12:13.129 --> 1:12:15.699
(tires squealing)

1:12:15.765 --> 1:12:17.534
(thudding)

1:12:22.138 --> 1:12:24.340
- Stop it.

1:12:24.774 --> 1:12:27.911
(cries out)

1:12:31.114 --> 1:12:34.818
- Darkness spreads.

1:12:38.254 --> 1:12:40.590
(tires squealing)

1:12:41.825 --> 1:12:43.727
(phone ringing)

1:12:43.793 --> 1:12:45.762
- [Woman] 911 what's
your emergency?

1:12:45.829 --> 1:12:52.836
- Hi we... shit.

1:12:54.203 --> 1:12:57.073
- Why did you do that?

1:12:57.140 --> 1:12:58.542
- Lita I was involved too okay?

1:12:58.608 --> 1:13:00.510
I can't tell the cops what
happened because they're just

1:13:00.577 --> 1:13:03.513
come after me, fuck.

1:13:03.580 --> 1:13:06.583
They fucking lied to me.

1:13:06.650 --> 1:13:08.151
I didn't know they were
going to kill him okay?

1:13:08.217 --> 1:13:09.719
I swear.

1:13:15.158 --> 1:13:16.259
(phone buzzing)

1:13:16.325 --> 1:13:19.596
Hi I'm sorry I dialed
911 on accident

1:13:19.663 --> 1:13:20.797
I was just driving and--

1:13:20.864 --> 1:13:25.134
- [Daniella] You can't
run forever Mark.

1:13:25.201 --> 1:13:26.570
- Daniella.

1:13:26.636 --> 1:13:29.205
- You're a part of this.

1:13:29.272 --> 1:13:34.010
- Daniella I need
you to remember okay?

1:13:34.077 --> 1:13:37.481
Remember who you are.

1:13:37.547 --> 1:13:40.884
Daniella, Daniella Menzie.

1:13:40.950 --> 1:13:44.554
- I know who I am.

1:13:44.621 --> 1:13:48.492
- Do you, do you really?

1:13:48.558 --> 1:13:51.528
It was Brett, he
manipulated you,

1:13:51.595 --> 1:13:53.763
he manipulated all of us.

1:13:53.830 --> 1:13:56.032
Brett never cared about
Davis he used him to get a

1:13:56.099 --> 1:13:59.636
percentage of his profits, he
steered you toward what you

1:13:59.703 --> 1:14:02.839
became he drove you
to do what you did.

1:14:02.906 --> 1:14:08.277
- But he gave me pink socks,
every time I showed up.

1:14:08.344 --> 1:14:10.514
Who else would do that for me?

1:14:10.580 --> 1:14:12.048
- Daniella.

1:14:12.115 --> 1:14:17.053
- All I feel is empty, a void.

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:19.856
I see a void.

1:14:23.092 --> 1:14:24.528
(gasps)

1:14:24.594 --> 1:14:28.532
- Are you okay?

1:14:28.598 --> 1:14:32.936
- He's dead, he's dead
there's nothing left.

1:14:33.002 --> 1:14:35.539
- No--

1:14:35.605 --> 1:14:38.742
(ominous music)

1:14:42.612 --> 1:14:45.481
- [Brett] We need
to take a drive.

1:14:50.854 --> 1:14:53.857
- [Lita] Where the
fuck are we going Mark?

1:14:53.923 --> 1:14:56.159
- Mickey's get away.

1:14:56.225 --> 1:14:57.761
- Mickey?

1:14:57.827 --> 1:14:59.763
Our bass player?

1:14:59.829 --> 1:15:02.999
- He's got a ranch house,
we'll be safe there.

1:15:03.066 --> 1:15:07.904
He said if we ever needed
an escape we could use it.

1:15:07.971 --> 1:15:11.875
Don't think he meant
that literally but.

1:15:11.941 --> 1:15:16.813
We should be safe there until
we figure out our next step.

1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:18.114
- And what?

1:15:18.181 --> 1:15:22.852
Start a new life?

1:15:22.919 --> 1:15:25.121
- Yeah.

1:15:27.757 --> 1:15:32.629
- Okay, but we're gonna have
to stop off someplace first.

1:15:32.696 --> 1:15:38.067
I'm gonna need a disguise, how
would you like a blond wife?

1:15:38.134 --> 1:15:40.236
I saw a drugstore 10 miles back.

1:15:40.303 --> 1:15:42.538
- Okay.

1:15:44.941 --> 1:15:47.677
(crickets chirping)

1:15:58.888 --> 1:16:02.125
- [Byron] Mickey's get away
what the hell is this Brett?

1:16:02.191 --> 1:16:04.594
- Trust me I'll explain.

1:16:21.911 --> 1:16:23.813
(giggling)

1:16:24.881 --> 1:16:28.284
- Brett listen man I just
wanna say I've known you a long

1:16:28.351 --> 1:16:30.920
time but can you do me a favor
and admit for the first time

1:16:30.987 --> 1:16:32.188
ever you don't know
what's goin' on?

1:16:32.255 --> 1:16:34.958
- Listen, I haven't
told you two something.

1:16:35.024 --> 1:16:38.995
But I've acquired some help
of a professional nature.

1:16:39.062 --> 1:16:43.833
I've been keeping
it quiet until now.

1:16:43.900 --> 1:16:50.073
But this help gave me this
address and we were to meet here

1:16:50.139 --> 1:16:51.808
in case anything went wrong.

1:16:51.875 --> 1:16:57.313
* Oh love I want us
all to feel you now

1:16:57.380 --> 1:17:03.820
* I'll be part of
those to show us how

1:17:03.887 --> 1:17:09.458
* Times are changing
faster than we even know

1:17:09.525 --> 1:17:15.431
* Options lay
waiting for our unity

1:17:15.498 --> 1:17:20.103
* Our part is somewhat
simple be the light

1:17:20.169 --> 1:17:22.405
* Sparkle revel in each

1:17:22.471 --> 1:17:26.375
- I'm gonna kill
Lita in front of Mark

1:17:26.442 --> 1:17:28.411
so he gets to see
what it feels like.

1:17:28.477 --> 1:17:29.846
- You got a point there
actually with that one.

1:17:29.913 --> 1:17:32.315
- That's right of course and
we mustn't forget that two

1:17:32.381 --> 1:17:37.120
wrongs do make a right as in
algebra if you study algebra

1:17:37.186 --> 1:17:41.224
two negatives make a positive
or outside the field of

1:17:41.290 --> 1:17:46.262
mathematics if I was to
say I do not not love you,

1:17:46.329 --> 1:17:48.898
I'd be saying I love you.

1:17:48.965 --> 1:17:55.739
- I am not not going to
kill Mark and his wife.

1:17:55.805 --> 1:17:59.142
- I believe you've got it,
I'm so proud of you Fiona.

1:17:59.208 --> 1:18:02.045
- Ohhh.

1:18:05.348 --> 1:18:07.116
(cries out)

1:18:16.225 --> 1:18:18.527
- Identity crisis, identity
crisis, identity crisis.

1:18:18.594 --> 1:18:21.230
- Okay, it's alright
sweetheart I have the bag,

1:18:21.297 --> 1:18:23.466
just go change okay?

1:18:23.532 --> 1:18:24.300
- Okay.

1:18:24.367 --> 1:18:26.102
- There you go, that's it.

1:18:26.169 --> 1:18:27.203
- Okay.

1:18:27.270 --> 1:18:30.173
- Take it easy.

1:18:33.142 --> 1:18:35.244
- Come on man really?

1:18:35.311 --> 1:18:38.014
I've known you a long time I
backed you up with the pink

1:18:38.081 --> 1:18:42.451
socks with your clients all
these outta control, controlling

1:18:42.518 --> 1:18:46.422
them for you, I've
done everything man
but this, I'm gonna

1:18:46.489 --> 1:18:49.158
tell you this better
be fucking worth it.

1:18:49.225 --> 1:18:50.927
- Oh.

1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:54.130
- [Static] Ura seconds.

1:19:00.870 --> 1:19:03.172
- I mean look I knew what
I was getting into right

1:19:03.239 --> 1:19:04.173
signing up for it and all.

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:05.341
- Right.

1:19:05.408 --> 1:19:06.575
- And I shouldn't be
rethinking it now.

1:19:06.642 --> 1:19:10.446
- I always try to avoid
rethinking things.

1:19:10.513 --> 1:19:11.747
- Study.

1:19:11.815 --> 1:19:15.351
- I busted my ass lighting
that God damn scene.

1:19:15.418 --> 1:19:17.821
Working that negative so it
looked like we were really

1:19:17.887 --> 1:19:21.090
on the moon you think that
was production design?

1:19:21.157 --> 1:19:25.494
Give me a God damn break I was
hiding flaws left and right.

1:19:25.561 --> 1:19:29.198
It was all me, it's
been a while now

1:19:29.265 --> 1:19:31.868
and I think I deserve
a little credit.

1:19:31.935 --> 1:19:33.269
- Credit's over rated.

1:19:33.336 --> 1:19:34.838
- Yeah the past is the past.

1:19:34.904 --> 1:19:37.506
- No, the past is
never the past.

1:19:37.573 --> 1:19:38.741
- It isn't?

1:19:38.808 --> 1:19:41.911
- No the past is
bullshit, it doesn't exist

1:19:41.978 --> 1:19:44.147
time doesn't exist.

1:19:44.213 --> 1:19:46.382
I mean think about it have
you ever found yourself

1:19:46.449 --> 1:19:49.518
in the past or in the
future have you ever really

1:19:49.585 --> 1:19:51.888
found yourself in the future?

1:19:51.955 --> 1:19:55.591
No it has always without
exception each and every fucking

1:19:55.658 --> 1:19:57.994
time been the present.

1:20:01.197 --> 1:20:02.298
Hello.

1:20:02.365 --> 1:20:04.433
- Hello.

1:20:04.500 --> 1:20:05.301
Oh.

1:20:05.368 --> 1:20:08.938
- I am the ninja of justice.

1:20:12.108 --> 1:20:15.044
- This is great really I mean
who are these people Brett.

1:20:15.111 --> 1:20:17.313
Brett what the fuck was
this guy talking about.

1:20:17.380 --> 1:20:18.181
- Shh.

1:20:18.247 --> 1:20:19.048
- He shot the moon landing.

1:20:19.115 --> 1:20:19.815
- He shot the moon landing?

1:20:19.883 --> 1:20:22.351
He shot the moon landing.

1:20:22.418 --> 1:20:23.586
- I knew it, I knew it.

1:20:23.652 --> 1:20:27.523
Did you shoot JFK and MLK too?

1:20:27.590 --> 1:20:31.895
- Okay, now calm down,
calm down I said.

1:20:31.961 --> 1:20:36.299
Now remember you are a ninja.

1:20:36.365 --> 1:20:39.102
- Take a seat.

1:20:45.541 --> 1:20:48.044
- So um, you are?

1:20:48.111 --> 1:20:52.648
- Oh I'm sorry my name is
Harriet and this here is Otto.

1:20:52.715 --> 1:20:54.350
Why don't you take a seat honey.

1:20:54.417 --> 1:20:57.253
Watch, listen.

1:21:07.463 --> 1:21:15.538
- My lady and gentlemen
look around you behold

1:21:15.604 --> 1:21:19.042
the great Eias.

1:21:20.709 --> 1:21:24.247
- There were two
women and two men.

1:21:25.248 --> 1:21:26.916
Once.

1:21:27.616 --> 1:21:30.419
- O O D one.

1:21:31.354 --> 1:21:35.224
And O O D two.

1:21:36.559 --> 1:21:41.998
Mr. Tubal and Y M.

1:21:48.137 --> 1:21:53.176
- Just ah look at them.

1:21:55.578 --> 1:21:58.047
Now.

1:22:01.717 --> 1:22:11.360
- This woman this O O D one is
more beautiful than the sands

1:22:11.427 --> 1:22:21.204
of time and I love her more
than you will ever know.

1:22:22.738 --> 1:22:30.079
- And I love you Mr. Tubal.

1:22:32.215 --> 1:22:39.655
- I love you too Mr. Tubal.

1:22:39.722 --> 1:22:43.392
- You can't have them both.

1:22:43.459 --> 1:22:47.196
Besides that's my wife.

1:22:47.263 --> 1:22:49.298
(laughing)

1:22:49.665 --> 1:22:51.634
You scum.

1:22:51.700 --> 1:22:55.671
- But is it a that or a she?

1:22:55.738 --> 1:22:57.573
(laughing)

1:22:57.640 --> 1:23:02.111
- That is mine.

1:23:05.548 --> 1:23:07.450
Stop it.

1:23:10.253 --> 1:23:12.355
Stop it!

1:23:12.788 --> 1:23:17.326
(cries out)
(laughing)

1:23:18.827 --> 1:23:23.166
- Darkness spreads.

1:23:28.904 --> 1:23:31.140
(laughing)

1:23:34.677 --> 1:23:37.246
(clicking)

1:23:43.786 --> 1:23:47.823
- I'm going to do
the honorable thing.

1:23:47.890 --> 1:23:51.026
The right thing.

1:23:54.730 --> 1:23:59.168
Goodbye my loves.

1:24:12.948 --> 1:24:17.153
- Shall I go to?

1:24:29.365 --> 1:24:38.607
- So fall us one,
so fall us all.

1:24:53.856 --> 1:25:00.363
- And hm, they fell alright.

1:25:04.933 --> 1:25:07.236
(clicking)

1:25:07.636 --> 1:25:09.538
(laughing)

1:25:10.439 --> 1:25:15.578
- Okay lady that's enough
for, for me anyway you know

1:25:15.644 --> 1:25:22.185
I'm not to into the cryptic
panoramic mumbo jumbo.

1:25:22.251 --> 1:25:23.519
- Pretentious.

1:25:23.586 --> 1:25:25.454
- Clearly, other than the
girl taking off the blouse

1:25:25.521 --> 1:25:28.324
that was kinda nice
I did like that.

1:25:28.391 --> 1:25:32.795
Other than that third grade
helmed gobbled gook shit

1:25:32.861 --> 1:25:34.930
see ya Brett I
wouldn't wanna be ya.

1:25:34.997 --> 1:25:36.632
I'm fucking outta here man.

1:25:36.699 --> 1:25:39.302
She's nuts man.

1:25:39.368 --> 1:25:41.604
- Do you feel that?

1:25:41.670 --> 1:25:45.574
You haven't felt that feeling
before have you Byron?

1:25:45.641 --> 1:25:47.543
It's called fear.

1:25:48.411 --> 1:25:49.945
- Now Harriet you've
done a marvelous job.

1:25:50.012 --> 1:25:51.880
- Don't try any of your
stupid mind games on here

1:25:51.947 --> 1:25:56.819
I practically invented them.

1:25:56.885 --> 1:25:59.488
Aren't you a little
afraid yourself?

1:25:59.555 --> 1:26:02.825
Now I know Stu ripped off your
father Byron and your parents

1:26:02.891 --> 1:26:06.629
Fiona but I think that was
small change compared to what

1:26:06.695 --> 1:26:09.498
he stole from your
old best friend Brett.

1:26:11.467 --> 1:26:17.373
Your best friend and Daniella's
brother Davis, oh he was

1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:26.615
a real genius, such a brilliant
mind, he invented this.

1:26:28.584 --> 1:26:32.020
But Stu went and stole his
technology and created the

1:26:32.087 --> 1:26:36.325
prototype himself you see
this here is knowledge,

1:26:36.392 --> 1:26:39.462
knowledge of things that
shouldn't be known to the world.

1:26:42.531 --> 1:26:43.999
(eerie chords)

1:26:44.066 --> 1:26:45.334
I have a little
surprise for you.

1:26:45.401 --> 1:26:48.671
Do you know that Stu never
took this thing public

1:26:48.737 --> 1:26:52.608
that if he had Bill Gates
would have look like a pauper

1:26:52.675 --> 1:26:54.610
in comparison to him.

1:26:55.711 --> 1:27:00.549
But no, he didn't and the
world hasn't been altered

1:27:00.616 --> 1:27:02.285
fortunately.

1:27:02.351 --> 1:27:04.387
I have a tiny little
surprise for you

1:27:04.453 --> 1:27:07.756
and I suggest you take it.

1:27:23.772 --> 1:27:28.711
I would like you all to
leave and return in one hour.

1:27:28.777 --> 1:27:34.550
I've a little surprise to
deliver into your laps.

1:27:34.617 --> 1:27:36.251
(claps)

1:27:58.941 --> 1:28:01.344
(laughing)

1:28:39.081 --> 1:28:41.584
- [Mark] You look
like a new woman.

1:28:41.650 --> 1:28:43.619
I feel like I'm
cheating on my wife.

1:28:43.686 --> 1:28:44.887
- [Lita] Jerk.

1:28:44.953 --> 1:28:48.424
- This is Mickey's get away.

1:28:50.593 --> 1:28:52.728
Keys.

1:29:00.969 --> 1:29:04.172
- I'm exhausted, I think
I'm just gonna take a shower

1:29:04.239 --> 1:29:05.874
and go to sleep.

1:29:05.941 --> 1:29:08.010
- Okay.

1:29:08.076 --> 1:29:13.516
Lita thanks for understanding.

1:29:13.582 --> 1:29:17.820
Your hair looks great.

1:29:17.886 --> 1:29:21.724
I think Mickey has some
night clothes in the bedroom.

1:29:21.790 --> 1:29:23.258
- [Lita] In the bedroom?

1:29:23.325 --> 1:29:27.095
The last time that we were in
a cabin it was our first time.

1:29:27.162 --> 1:29:28.964
- [Mark] How could I forget?

1:29:29.965 --> 1:29:32.401
(giggles)

1:29:39.975 --> 1:29:44.379
(moaning)
(groaning)

1:30:15.143 --> 1:30:16.979
I love you.

1:30:17.045 --> 1:30:19.982
- I love you too.

1:30:25.888 --> 1:30:28.457
(crying out)

1:30:46.108 --> 1:30:48.511
- I'm all out of grape flavor

1:30:48.577 --> 1:30:52.615
so I thought I
would pop a cherry.

1:30:54.717 --> 1:30:56.919
(laughing)

1:31:02.090 --> 1:31:06.962
(ominous music)

1:31:39.962 --> 1:31:43.098
(water running)

1:31:52.007 --> 1:31:54.677
- Darkness spreads.

1:32:23.906 --> 1:32:25.974
- I must be goin'
crazy (laughs).

1:32:29.077 --> 1:32:31.780
(ominous music)

1:32:47.329 --> 1:32:49.632
(thudding)
(crying out)

1:32:50.232 --> 1:32:51.967
- [Byron] Hey mother fucker.

1:32:52.367 --> 1:32:52.935
(thuds)

1:32:53.001 --> 1:32:54.803
Come here you.

1:32:54.870 --> 1:32:59.775
You, you betrayed us man
no matter what you do

1:32:59.842 --> 1:33:02.678
no matter where you go you
will always be one of us

1:33:02.745 --> 1:33:04.112
do you understand me?

1:33:04.179 --> 1:33:06.782
(thudding)
(crying out)

1:33:09.752 --> 1:33:12.254
Yeah I should put
a bullet right in

1:33:12.320 --> 1:33:15.658
the back of your head pal.

1:33:19.427 --> 1:33:21.263
- He's right.

1:33:21.797 --> 1:33:25.167
(crunches)
(cries out)

1:33:25.233 --> 1:33:26.902
- I just want out that's all.

1:33:26.969 --> 1:33:28.070
- Lying fuck.

1:33:28.136 --> 1:33:29.672
- Please.

1:33:29.738 --> 1:33:31.740
(thuds)
(crying out)

1:33:31.807 --> 1:33:32.975
- You let me deal with him.

1:33:33.041 --> 1:33:33.942
- Yeah.

1:33:34.009 --> 1:33:34.943
(crying out)

1:33:35.010 --> 1:33:36.311
- [Girl] Fuck!

1:33:36.812 --> 1:33:38.246
- Go take care of that.

1:33:38.313 --> 1:33:42.184
I'll take care of him.

1:33:42.250 --> 1:33:44.653
- No, no!

1:33:45.353 --> 1:33:47.122
(crying out)

1:33:48.523 --> 1:33:50.125
(gun firing)

1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:56.999
(crunches)
(cries out)

1:33:57.065 --> 1:33:59.968
- [Mark] Come on
let's go, let's go.

1:34:00.035 --> 1:34:01.704
Run.

1:34:05.073 --> 1:34:06.041
(cries out)

1:34:06.108 --> 1:34:07.209
- [Lita] Mark!

1:34:07.275 --> 1:34:10.378
- Keep on running
Lita go, don't stop.

1:34:10.445 --> 1:34:14.649
(dramatic music)

1:34:21.189 --> 1:34:22.024
(clicks)

1:34:22.090 --> 1:34:24.159
- [Brett] Hold it there Mark.

1:34:24.226 --> 1:34:25.994
- Mark where are you?

1:34:26.061 --> 1:34:26.829
Mark!

1:34:26.895 --> 1:34:27.429
Mark!

1:34:27.495 --> 1:34:28.864
Mark!

1:34:28.931 --> 1:34:33.068
Mark!
(merry go round music)

1:34:36.371 --> 1:34:38.206
(guns firing)

1:34:56.224 --> 1:34:57.425
(water rushing)

1:34:57.492 --> 1:35:00.829
- I am so disappointed in you.

1:35:08.236 --> 1:35:09.304
Now missy you don't--

1:35:09.371 --> 1:35:12.808
(gun firing)
(splats)

1:35:17.245 --> 1:35:19.081
- [Mark] Come here.

1:35:22.951 --> 1:35:26.054
- I'm so sorry for everything.

1:35:26.121 --> 1:35:28.023
- No I'm sorry.

1:35:30.458 --> 1:35:32.194
I love you.

1:35:32.260 --> 1:35:33.028
- Let's go.

1:35:33.095 --> 1:35:33.996
- Lita!

1:35:34.062 --> 1:35:37.365
(squelches)

1:35:37.432 --> 1:35:40.168
(ominous music)

1:35:40.235 --> 1:35:44.139
No, no, no, no, no.

1:35:45.307 --> 1:35:47.109
No.

1:36:04.426 --> 1:36:06.461
- I could shoot you right now.

1:36:07.529 --> 1:36:09.331
I don't really think that
you've suffered enough though

1:36:09.397 --> 1:36:11.133
do you?

1:36:11.499 --> 1:36:13.101
How much have you suffered?

1:36:13.168 --> 1:36:16.905
Do you think that
you've suffered as
much as Jenna suffered?

1:36:16.972 --> 1:36:19.074
Maybe next time you'll
think twice before you kill

1:36:19.141 --> 1:36:20.408
someone's sister.

1:36:20.475 --> 1:36:23.311
I'll give you til
the count of five.

1:36:23.378 --> 1:36:24.947
Four.

1:36:25.513 --> 1:36:27.082
Three.

1:36:27.149 --> 1:36:28.183
Two.

1:36:33.288 --> 1:36:34.857
(screaming)

1:36:35.423 --> 1:36:36.959
(thuds)

1:36:40.162 --> 1:36:42.264
- No.

1:36:59.614 --> 1:37:02.417
- Wait, wait don't
do it, don't do it.

1:37:04.519 --> 1:37:05.553
- She.

1:37:05.620 --> 1:37:07.189
- I know.

1:37:07.255 --> 1:37:08.456
- She.

1:37:08.523 --> 1:37:12.027
- Mark I know.

1:37:12.094 --> 1:37:15.063
- She fucking killed Lita.

1:37:16.264 --> 1:37:19.267
- Put down the rock.

1:37:23.105 --> 1:37:25.974
- She didn't have
anything to do with it.

1:37:29.511 --> 1:37:32.080
She wasn't even there.

1:37:32.147 --> 1:37:34.316
- But Mark it has to stop.

1:37:34.382 --> 1:37:40.288
Here and now all this
killing all this blood shed

1:37:40.355 --> 1:37:43.058
it's gone viral.

1:37:43.125 --> 1:37:49.231
Stu started it and
you, you can end it.

1:37:49.297 --> 1:37:55.370
You, you just have
to choose to stop.

1:37:59.574 --> 1:38:02.010
(water rushing)

1:38:08.216 --> 1:38:09.651
- Decision time.

1:38:09.717 --> 1:38:11.954
- Indeed.

1:38:12.020 --> 1:38:17.092
- I think, I think he's
gonna do the right thing.

1:38:17.159 --> 1:38:18.693
- Is that what you want?

1:38:18.760 --> 1:38:20.162
- That's what should happen.

1:38:20.228 --> 1:38:23.631
- It's such a shame, you're
released from your contract

1:38:23.698 --> 1:38:26.101

1:38:49.191 --> 1:38:51.326
(screams)

1:39:10.745 --> 1:39:14.116
(crying)

1:39:26.361 --> 1:39:30.999
- Do you know any
good psychiatrists?

1:39:34.302 --> 1:39:37.505
(gentle music)

1:40:19.647 --> 1:40:22.717
- Alright this is one of my
newer songs written back from

1:40:22.784 --> 1:40:24.486
the time of the Beatles.

1:40:24.552 --> 1:40:26.088
- I can't wait.

1:40:26.154 --> 1:40:29.324
- It's called Menzie technology.
