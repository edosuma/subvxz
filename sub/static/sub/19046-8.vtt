or break you in this town.

19:53.927 --> 19:56.694
Hey.
You look gorgeous.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.462
Hey, listen, ladies.
This is my sister.

19:58.464 --> 20:02.200
Notice how disgustingly
skinny she is.
Isn't it weird?

20:02.202 --> 20:04.802
Oh, my God!
You are like crack skinny!

20:04.804 --> 20:06.437
Oh! Okay!
That's a compliment.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.774
She throws up
all the time.
Oh, my God. I just got done.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.609
I'm sorry
if my breath stinks.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.812
Hey, Dennis, want one?
Maybe not tonight, ladies.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.614
I'm kinda working
on something.

20:16.616 --> 20:20.551
- Oh, come on.
Don't be a loser.
- Yeah!

20:20.553 --> 20:23.554
Well, uh, all right.
Yeah, maybe just one.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.957
Do you have one
for my sister too?

20:25.959 --> 20:29.360
- Sure.
- What is it?

20:29.362 --> 20:31.829
You'll see.

20:32.531 --> 20:34.966
<i>Chop, chop, chop.</i>
<i>Good! Good!</i>

20:34.968 --> 20:38.836
The cat's dead. I don't
see any problems with that
other than the fact...

20:38.838 --> 20:40.738
that the camera might
see my hand killing the cat.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.541
We're gonna pull the cat
out of there before
it gets to the chopper.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.777
But if Sweet Dee doesn't
make it in time, you're gonna
see me chop the cat.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.447
Just don't drop the cat.
I can't make that promise.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.617
Come on.
Whoa! Where have you guys been?
You look like shit.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.785
I don't want to
talk about that.
Did you become celebrities yet?

20:54.787 --> 20:58.389
We're not doing the
celebrity thing anymore.
We're done with that.

20:58.391 --> 21:01.459
No. We need you guys.
'Cause we got this great
chopping mechanism.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.828
- It's for the news show.
- There is no news show,
Charlie!

21:03.830 --> 21:06.764
Yes, there is a news show,
Dennis! We're gonna put it
on public access!

21:06.766 --> 21:09.934
Nobody watches public access.
I don't want to be
on public access.
