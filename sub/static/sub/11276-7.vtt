WOMAN ( <i>on TV</i> ):        
     You're up pretty late,     
          aren't you?

00:08.600 --> 00:11.500
Nothing better to do      
         than watch TV?

00:11.500 --> 00:15.100
Feeling a little lonely     
        in the big city?

00:15.100 --> 00:16.500
Come and join the party.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.800
Call 5, double five, P-R-T-Y,

00:19.900 --> 00:23.000
for the best party line     
    in Boston, that's right.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
There are lots of fun people  
     on the line right now

00:26.000 --> 00:29.700
waiting for you to join     
    in their fun talk.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.900
Why don't you try it?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.700
There's only one way to find out

00:37.700 --> 00:41.500
what sort of wild people    
      call the party line.

00:41.500 --> 00:45.500

How about over here             
by the bar, Miss Howe?

01:49.500 --> 01:51.600
Do we really have to do this?

01:51.600 --> 01:52.900
What's going on?

01:52.900 --> 01:54.000
I'll be right with you.

01:54.100 --> 01:57.100
The <i>Globe's</i> doing an article    
on women who run pubs.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.800
Now he wants                    
to take my picture.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.100
I really dread this, Sam.

02:00.100 --> 02:00.900
Why?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Because I get               
    so tensed up

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
in front of a camera.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.100
All of a sudden

02:04.200 --> 02:07.200
I start looking like something 
      the cat coughed up.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.600
Ooh, can I have    
             an eight-by-ten    
             for my mantelpiece?

02:10.600 --> 02:15.000
How about a two-by-four         
for your bridgework?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Listen, let me give you         
a few hints here.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.200
I had a lot of pictures taken   
of me when I was playing ball.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.900
Just relax, take        
     the tip of your tongue

02:22.900 --> 02:23.900
and wet your lips.

02:23.900 --> 02:24.900
Good.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.100
Now, wet my lips.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.800
Oh, Malone!

02:27.800 --> 02:29.400
Uh-oh, you're tensing           
up now, just relax.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.700
( <i>camera shutter clicks</i> )

02:30.700 --> 02:31.900
Thank you.

02:31.900 --> 02:32.900
No, wait a minute!

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
You can't use that picture!

02:34.000 --> 02:35.700
I had my tongue
                 sticking out.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.400
Can I have three        
        copies of that?

Now, please, take  
             another picture and
             warn me this time.

02:40.700 --> 02:42.900
I want this to look     
        natural and spontaneous.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.200
Come on, come on.               
You gotta relax.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.500
Think of something              
ridiculous.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.500

I use with the kids.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.900
Thanks, Miss Howe.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.500
Boy, oh, boy.

03:06.500 --> 03:10.000
How many times have I walked  
    through that door, huh?

Yep, good-bye old bar.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.500
Take care, old stool.

Where you       
                going, Cliff?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.500
I'm going in                    
for surgery tomorrow.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.600

walk into God's blue sky again.

at Melville's?

03:30.700 --> 03:33.600
No, Woody.          
             No, never mind.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.900
What, what are you, what
        are you talking about?

03:35.900 --> 03:37.500
Well, it took               
    a lot of expensive

03:37.500 --> 03:39.000
and complicated             
    tests, Sammy,

03:39.100 --> 03:40.700
but they finally            
    found out

03:40.800 --> 03:42.900
what that pain was          
    in my abdomen.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.600
The experts call it         
    appendicitis.

Woo, Cliffie,   
                come on.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.300
Now, that's a simple...
         you know, I had it     
         when I was a kid.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.500
There's nothing
                 to it.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.000
I actually liked                
having my appendix out.

03:55.100 --> 03:57.700
My parents told me I could      
have all the ice cream I wanted.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.700
No, Woody,

03:58.700 --> 04:00.700
I think you're        
          talking about tonsils.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.100
Well, it was a long time ago,   
Sam, but I'm pretty sure

04:03.100 --> 04:04.800
it was ice cream.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.600
So when are you going in?

04:09.700 --> 04:11.300
It's tomorrow.

Now, look, I want you guys      
    to promise me, you know,

if I don't pull through     
     this thing, you know,

04:16.399 --> 04:18.000

where you guys sit around       
and tell the funniest           
stories about me.

Okay, I got dibs
                on this one.

It's a Mercedes, dear.

That was a joke, Frasier.

Oh, I forgot I      
            married a madcap.

about your little

We're talking about

So, now,    
                  where was I?

So you gonna see            
    the Grand Canyon?

FRASIER:                        
Of course. Okay,                
gather around everybody.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.300
I'll show you the interstates  
    we're gonna take.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.900
Sam, can I talk to you     
         for a minute?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.200
Sure, have a seat.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.500
Frasier and I

05:12.600 --> 05:15.800
will be covering over           
4,500 miles round trip,

05:15.800 --> 05:17.000
and I think it's only fair

05:17.100 --> 05:18.600
that I share                    
some of the driving.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.500
However, I am handicapped       
by one tiny thing.

05:21.500 --> 05:25.200
I've never operated             
a motorized vehicle before.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.100
You don't know
                  how to drive?

05:28.100 --> 05:28.800
I always meant to learn,

05:28.900 --> 05:31.800
but when I was a teenager,      
I was too busy having fun.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.900
Would you teach me, Sam?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.200
Uh, well, what
                  about Frasier?

05:37.300 --> 05:38.400
We're too close.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.100
I need someone                  
to whom I have

05:40.200 --> 05:42.500
no emotional                    
attachment whatsoever.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.600
So as a friend,                 
would you do me this favor?

05:45.600 --> 05:47.700
Yeah, why not?

05:47.700 --> 05:48.800
When do we start?

05:48.900 --> 05:49.600
The sooner the better.

05:49.700 --> 05:50.700
All right.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.600
Um, how do you         
         think I'll do?

05:52.600 --> 05:57.000
I've never had a woman in  
     a car that didn't do great.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.000
Wonderful.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.100
You teach me to drive,

05:59.200 --> 06:01.500
I'll help you                   
with your sense of humor.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.800
Here's where you've   
        got to be real careful.

06:04.900 --> 06:06.600
You see, I-75 runs     
     right down here into I-30.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.800
Now, if you don't stay in that 
         far left lane,

06:08.800 --> 06:11.400
it's hello, Tulsa!

06:11.400 --> 06:14.100
Well, I've got to be            
moseying on, you guys.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.100
I'll, you know,                 
see you later.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.500
I'm going under the knife       
in about 12 hours or so.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.600
Yeah, look, don't feel

06:18.700 --> 06:20.500
that you have to go         
out of your way to stop by,

06:20.600 --> 06:22.100
you know, and visit,

06:22.100 --> 06:24.300
New England Presbyterian,       
Room one niner four,

06:24.300 --> 06:26.900
visiting hours between          
11:00 and 9:00.

06:26.900 --> 06:29.500
Cliffie, I'm sure everything
    is going to be just okay.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.000
Oh, yeah, well, no,       
      sure, there's no...

06:31.000 --> 06:33.100
You know, I'm in the hands      
of skilled professionals.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.300
It's not like the old days,

06:34.300 --> 06:36.700
is it, you know, where     
they give you a shot of whiskey,

06:36.700 --> 06:39.200
lick the scalpel and they       
    go a-carving, huh?

06:39.300 --> 06:40.600
You know, the same is true      
    in my profession.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.900
Time was when a person's    
    behavior deviated in any way

06:43.000 --> 06:44.800
from what society 
              considered normal,

06:44.800 --> 06:46.600
the town barber             
    would take a rusty drill,

06:46.600 --> 06:49.800
bore a hole in your head,       
and let the evil spirits out.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.600
Well, it's a good thing we 
     didn't live back then, huh?

06:52.600 --> 06:54.600
Yeah, you'd be looking     
pretty much like a whiffle ball

06:54.600 --> 06:56.100
by now, wouldn't ya?

07:02.400 --> 07:03.000
I don't believe you guys.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.100
That's it.                      
I'm leaving.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.400
Come on.               
                    Fine! Fine!

07:05.400 --> 07:07.100
Who needs your kind       
      around here anyway?

07:07.100 --> 07:09.000
Gentlemen!

07:09.100 --> 07:11.500
Now I think that this bar       
is big enough for people

07:11.600 --> 07:15.700
who like <i>The Addams Family</i>      
        and <i>The Munsters.</i>

07:17.500 --> 07:20.300
Okay, all right, fine.

07:20.300 --> 07:23.400
I'll take back what             
I said about Cousin It.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.800
That's okay, it was in 
         the heat of the moment.

07:25.800 --> 07:26.800
All right.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.700
Hey, hey, hey,                  
here's that article

07:28.700 --> 07:30.300
they interviewed        
          Rebecca for.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.200
Look at that.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.200
Oh, hey, how's              
    her picture?

07:32.300 --> 07:33.500
There isn't
                     one.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.100
Oh, God, it was so crummy       
they didn't even print it.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.200
Oh, wait a minute.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.600
there it is, right              
there on the back.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.800
How is it?

07:39.800 --> 07:42.300
ALL:              
              Eww!

07:42.300 --> 07:44.000
Is it that bad?

07:44.100 --> 07:47.000
No, Norm got cheese whiz        
all over the paper.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.100
Actually,               
     the picture's not bad.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.100
Not bad?

07:51.100 --> 07:52.100
It's great.

07:52.100 --> 07:55.200
Let me see that.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.300
This is a decent            
    picture of me.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.300
Look at that!

07:57.300 --> 08:00.000
I'm gorgeous and sexy.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.200
And dead as a doornail.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.800
What?

08:03.800 --> 08:05.000
You're in the obituaries.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.400
Oh, God!

08:08.300 --> 08:11.100
No, don't feel bad, it says   
        you died in bed.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.500
I didn't know you helped        
build the Panama Canal.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.400
Woody, that is someone     
        else's obituary.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.100
I am not dead.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.500
I am a living,         
     breathing human being.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
I know that.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.700
So where'd they put     
        all the dirt, anyway?

08:29.500 --> 08:32.299
Excuse me, can I get      
someone to sign for these?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.299
Yo, right over here.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.700
Let me see these.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.799
Oh, they're from       
         corporate headquarters.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.500
Did we do well last month?

08:41.600 --> 08:44.300
"Dear friends at Cheers,        
we mourn the loss

08:44.300 --> 08:46.700
"of Rebecca Howe.

08:46.700 --> 08:50.300
At last her pain is over."

08:50.300 --> 08:53.400
I'm going to call them up,
      straighten this out

08:53.400 --> 08:55.600
before they start making
        funeral arrangements.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.900
If I were you,                  
I'd have a closed casket.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.600
Yeah, well, why Grandpa Munster 
    never won an Emmy,

09:02.700 --> 09:04.200
I'll never know.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.800
Come on, maybe it's because     
he stole his whole character

09:06.800 --> 09:08.100
from Uncle Fester.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.800
Oh, Lord, is this           
    still going on?!

09:10.800 --> 09:13.400
This has got to be one of       
    the stupidest arguments

09:13.500 --> 09:15.900
I've ever heard    
             since I started    
             coming to this bar.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.100
Hey, we resent that.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.600
Yeah, why wasn't    
            it <i>the</i> stupidest?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.900
Well, frankly, it lacks     
    meaningless statistics

09:23.000 --> 09:25.600
and inane historical trivia.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.900
Say, where is Cliff anyway?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Yeah, is he still           
    in the hospital?

09:31.100 --> 09:32.900
Uh, I don't know,   
            how's he doing?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.800
I thought you were          
      going to go see him.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.900
Well, I tried, I mean, I got   
 as far as the hospital lobby,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.400
but you know, the smell of      
alcohol makes me really queasy.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.200
Well, I, you know, I was gonna 
 go see him, but I got to wait

09:46.200 --> 09:47.600
until I have a night off here.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.600
Woody? How about you?

09:49.600 --> 09:55.400
Oh, that's what this string   
      on my finger is for.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.400
What the heck is this one for?

10:00.200 --> 10:03.500
Surely somebody gave him a call

10:03.500 --> 10:06.200
or sent flowers, a card?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.700
Carla?

10:07.700 --> 10:09.300
Yeah, right.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.600
( <i>muttering excuses</i> )

10:11.600 --> 10:13.400
Look, this is terrible!

10:13.400 --> 10:14.400
Don't you realize

10:14.400 --> 10:16.500
that since Cliff's          
    mother moved to Florida,

10:16.600 --> 10:17.900
we are his sole support group?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.100
This desertion         
     in his hour of crisis

10:20.100 --> 10:22.800
could cause him deep      
        emotional scars.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.400
So why didn't  
                 you go see him?

10:24.500 --> 10:28.800
Well, what,                     
I don't have a life?

10:28.800 --> 10:30.100
I think we ought to go
          down there right now

10:30.100 --> 10:31.600
and tell Mr. Clavin   
          how we feel about him.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.500
Don't you think that    
        would be a little cruel?

10:34.500 --> 10:37.600
I mean, the guy       
          just had an operation.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.300
Actually, visiting              
hours are over.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.400
We're going to have             
to wait until tomorrow.         
                        Yeah.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.100
Hey, wait a minute.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.200
Cliff's at New England          
Presbyterian.

10:46.300 --> 10:47.900
That's on my rounds--      
 I have to go by there tonight.

10:47.900 --> 10:48.900
I can get in to see him.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.800
Well, great, why don't
            you go buy a card

10:50.800 --> 10:52.200
and date it yesterday,

10:52.200 --> 10:53.800
sign all our      
              names to it, okay?

10:53.800 --> 10:55.200
Slam dunk.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.100
Is that going to be enough?

10:57.100 --> 10:59.000
Come on, it's just          
        an appendectomy.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.700
They're taking out          
        a useless organ.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.400
He's chock-full of those.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.900
Ah, excuse me,                  
I'm Dr. Crane.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.300
Uh, where is Mr. Clavin?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.800
He was just discharged.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.100
Oh, great, just my luck.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.500
I'm the one who gets to run all 
over town to find a stupid card

11:21.500 --> 11:23.700
for the idiot, Clavin, 
         and he isn't even here.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.800
Just a token of     
            how much we care.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.200
Don't you want                  
to read the card?

11:41.300 --> 11:43.000
I, uh, just         
            forgot my jacket.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.100
Well, you're going to hear it  
         anyway, Cliff.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.900
"Glad you're feeling better.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.600
"So sorry you were ill.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.800
"If you thought things     
        were bad before,

11:52.800 --> 11:54.900
wait till you get the bill."

11:56.300 --> 11:59.000
Oh, that zesty greeting card  
          humor, huh?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.200
( <i>chuckling</i> )

12:00.300 --> 12:02.700
Well, gee, Cliff,           
I was just trying to help.

12:02.700 --> 12:06.300
You want to help?

12:06.300 --> 12:08.300
Well, uh, maybe you
             can help with this.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.800
I, uh,

12:09.900 --> 12:12.400
I been doing some   
            soul searching here.

12:12.400 --> 12:16.100
A man gets a lot of     
        time to think with a    
        tube up his nose, and...

12:18.000 --> 12:20.500
What I... what I    
         realized is that, uh...

12:20.500 --> 12:22.400
I'm alone in this world.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.100
I mean, uh, nobody
              came to visit me.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.000
Not one of my so-called
            friends out there

12:27.000 --> 12:29.400
even bothered to    
         walk through that door.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.600
Look, and they all feel terrible
        about it, Cliff.

12:31.700 --> 12:32.700
They lead busy lives.

12:32.700 --> 12:33.800
They just couldn't find     
        the time.

12:33.900 --> 12:36.000
Come on, Doc, cut the   
        malarkey, will you?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.400
They found the time
             to visit Sammy

12:37.500 --> 12:38.500
when he was     
                in the hospital.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.000
And Carla when she
              had the twin.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.200
Normie, when he went in
         for the butt tuck...

12:44.000 --> 12:46.100
I know why they
                 didn't visit.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.100
It's because it was me.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.000
No, Cliff.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.500
Oh, yeah, come on, Doc.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.400
They don't like me,    
         they don't really care.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.500
Come on, you can  
              tell me the truth.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.700
Go ahead, right between 
        the eyes, give it to me.

12:58.600 --> 12:59.600
Well, I suppose you're not

12:59.600 --> 13:01.400
the most popular person     
          in the bar.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.800
Oh, and you are, huh?

13:05.500 --> 13:08.800
Doc, you suppose                
comments like that

13:08.800 --> 13:09.800
are part of the problem?

13:09.800 --> 13:10.900
Could be.

13:10.900 --> 13:13.000
God, I don't believe it.

13:13.100 --> 13:17.300
I mean, all these years,    
    and I never realized it.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.000
( <i>chuckling softly</i> )

13:19.000 --> 13:21.100
Could I really be           
    that insensitive?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.800
( <i>man groaning</i> )

13:23.900 --> 13:25.900
Cliff.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.900
Oh, God, I am insensitive.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.700
Hey, sorry there, old timer.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.700
What can I do about it?

13:34.700 --> 13:36.800
A little therapy   
             might not be amiss.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.200
Oh, no, Doc, isn't there        
something better than therapy?

13:39.300 --> 13:40.600
I mean, you know,               
something

13:40.700 --> 13:42.300
a little quicker;               
you know, a little easier.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.700
We're talking about a major
     personality change, Cliff.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.200
It's not like you're            
trying to quit smoking.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.600
We can't give you           
    an electric shock

13:47.600 --> 13:48.900
every time              
you reach for a cigarette.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.400
Hey, hey, hey, yeah,      
     that's not a bad idea.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.300
Now, now, now,                  
just calm down.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.600
Look, maybe                     
I'm overstating the problem.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.500
Maybe all you need to get people
to like you a little better

13:58.500 --> 14:00.600
is just some good,              
old-fashioned politeness.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.600
Maybe you don't need to take    
any desperate measures.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.100
Oh, yes, he does.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.000
So, you get ahold of him?

14:17.100 --> 14:18.100
No, no, no, just get

14:18.200 --> 14:20.800
the darned answering machine  
         all the time.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.100
I hate that message.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.000
It's not so much        
the content of the message

14:25.100 --> 14:29.000
as the fact that Cliff sings it 
    to the tune of "Volare."

14:29.000 --> 14:30.900
Well, he's got to come back   
        sooner or later.

14:30.900 --> 14:32.400
Look, I suggest         
    that when he does,

14:32.400 --> 14:34.700
we all give him         
      a very warm welcome.

14:34.700 --> 14:38.300
Well, all I'm promising     
is not to treat him like a bug.

14:38.400 --> 14:42.500
Well, you see, Carla's willing 
     to go that extra mile.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.800
Hello, Frasier.

14:43.900 --> 14:46.100
Ah.

14:46.100 --> 14:48.300
Hello, blossom bottom,          
how was your lesson?

14:48.300 --> 14:50.300
I like driving.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.000
It's a wonderful feeling.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.100
Total control of   
             woman over machine.

14:54.100 --> 14:59.400
The speed, the power, the   
    ecstasy-- I was jazzed.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.700
You know,

15:02.800 --> 15:04.500
you're insane.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.800
You're a maniac.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.600
You're certifiable.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.900
I'm glad to see you're
          talking to me again.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.100
Has your nose       
            stopped bleeding?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.500
Geez, Sam,                      
are you all right?

15:13.600 --> 15:14.800
No thanks to your wife.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.600
I cannot believe you made       
that gesture to that guy.

15:19.300 --> 15:24.400
I see people make       
        that gesture to         
        Frasier all the time.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.000
Yeah, but Frasier's not driving 
         an 18-wheeler

15:27.100 --> 15:28.200
with a little bumper sticker

15:28.300 --> 15:30.200
that says               
  "Insured by Smith & Wesson."

15:30.200 --> 15:33.700
Well, he cut me off.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.000
That happens all the time.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.500
It doesn't mean         
    that you gun it up to 80

15:37.500 --> 15:38.900
and run the guy off the road.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.700
I blew his doors
                off, didn't I?

15:43.800 --> 15:47.400
The last thing you want to do  
is stop the car, get out,

15:47.400 --> 15:50.400
and start poking your finger  
in the folds of his neck.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.100
I wasn't afraid; I thought 
     you could handle him.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.600
Yeah, well, I tried, didn't I?

15:54.700 --> 15:58.700
Oh, yes, that vicious   
        head butt to his fist   
        sent him reeling.

15:58.800 --> 15:59.800
Hey, come on.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.200
Come on, honey,
                 let's hurry    
                 and have lunch.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.300
I'm anxious to      
            take you for a spin.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.500
Certainly, my dear.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.000
Yeah, lots      
                of luck, Doc.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.200
You know,      
                 she's a menace.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.400
You know, you are a hazard

16:10.400 --> 16:12.500
to every driver and pedestrian 
          on the road.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.800
I'll tell you  
                 something else.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.400
You know,               
    you shouldn't be allowed

16:15.500 --> 16:16.900
to get anywhere near       
     anything with wheels,

16:16.900 --> 16:19.800
because you are, by far,    
 the worst, the most dangerous,

16:19.800 --> 16:22.800
the most maniacal driver    
        I've ever seen.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.300
I was fine.

16:30.100 --> 16:33.900
Now, Cliff,                     
let me remind you again,

16:33.900 --> 16:35.200
that it's                       
extremely unorthodox

16:35.300 --> 16:37.400
to use shock aversion treatment 
outside the clinic.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.700
I make no guarantees.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.000
Hey, look, we       
            covered all that.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.700
It's time to go for
             broke, all right?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.400
Whatever you say;               
are your contacts in place?

16:43.400 --> 16:45.400
Yeah, here, better test
         it just to make sure.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.400
Good idea.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.700
Say something obnoxious.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.000
What do you     
                mean, obnoxious?

16:49.100 --> 16:50.000
I don't know        
            what's obnoxious.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.200
You're the    
            so-called expert.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.300

16:52.300 --> 16:53.800
Perfect.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.200
Guys, look, it's Cliff;         
he's back.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.800
Okay, remember, this is     
      his first time back

16:59.800 --> 17:02.100
since the operation, so just  
  make a big welcome for him

17:02.100 --> 17:04.400
and act like you're interested  
in everything he has to say.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.099
CLIFF:             
        Hey, guys.

All right!

17:09.500 --> 17:11.700
Hey, I hardly recognize you
     out of uniform, big guy.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.000
SAM:                            
Yeah, listen,                   
we're so sorry

17:13.000 --> 17:14.700
we didn't come down             
to the hospital.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.000
Oh, no problem.

17:16.099 --> 17:17.599
Yeah, so how was the operation?

17:17.599 --> 17:19.800
Yeah, yeah, how much
            did they shave?

17:19.800 --> 17:22.700
Ah, I don't want to bore you    
with stories about me.

17:22.700 --> 17:25.400
I'm more interested in, uh,     
what you guys have been up to.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.400
I don't    
                     know, uh...

No, no, don't be shy;           
come on, share with me.

So, uh...

when are you getting back       
to the route?

17:55.300 --> 17:58.100
Well, the doc said      
             an ordinary guy

17:58.100 --> 17:59.400
would be out      
            for three weeks,

17:59.500 --> 18:01.500
but with my incredible
        physical stamina...

18:07.800 --> 18:08.900
You know, the...

pain from the stitches.

Oh, wow, man.

You know, it's lucky            
you dropped by.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.200
We were having                  
this argument.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.400
Maybe you can settle it         
for us.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.700
We were wondering               
who came up

Okay, but     
                  keep it short.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.700
Well, uh, you know,       
  interestingly enough, uh...

18:41.800 --> 18:46.900
it harks back to, uh, the early 
Persian empire, about 500 B.C.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.700
Oh, is that right?
      Great.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.000
Really?                 
              Oh, yeah, yeah.

Get out.
    Oh, yeah; no, really.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.000
The pyramids for example--
      they were post offices.

When you were   
                in the hospital,

19:10.500 --> 19:12.200
did they give  
                 you a lobotomy?

Well, it's some harebrained
     scheme I came up with. I...

21:03.300 --> 21:04.700
When you guys didn't        
    visit me in the hospital,

21:04.800 --> 21:08.000
I... knew it was            
    because I wasn't popular,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.300
so I, uh, went down to     
     this aversion therapy place

21:11.400 --> 21:14.000
and bribed the guy
              to give me a shock

every time I acted
              like a jerk.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.000
I thought it would make
         me a different person.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.400
I guess                         
it didn't work, huh?

21:22.400 --> 21:23.800
I better be going.

            I, uh...

21:28.800 --> 21:30.800
guess I won't, huh?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.200
He'll be back.

Yeah, sure he will.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.000
I don't know.

Yeah, kind of sounded           
different this time.

         to go get him.

And it wasn't   
                really necessary

because we're

Well, I guess I'm a big enough 
  man to accept your apologies

and I guess there are one       
  or two things I could change

23:03.500 --> 23:07.200
