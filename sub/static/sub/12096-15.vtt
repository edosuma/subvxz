<i>This is the story of two sisters:</i>

00:08.080 --> 00:11.835
<i>Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell.</i>

00:12.040 --> 00:16.239
<i>Jessica lives in a neighbourhood</i>
<i>known as rich.</i>

00:16.440 --> 00:18.159
<i>Jessica likes life.</i>

00:18.360 --> 00:21.319
<i>The only thing about life</i>
<i>she would change, if she could,</i>

00:21.520 --> 00:23.989
<i>is that she would set it</i>
<i>all to music.</i>

00:25.160 --> 00:28.756
<i>The Tates have more secrets</i>
<i>than they do money.</i>

00:31.600 --> 00:34.638
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>Mary Campbell's house.</i>

00:36.520 --> 00:38.159
<i>Mary, too, likes life.</i>

00:38.360 --> 00:42.240
<i>Unfortunately, life doesn't seem</i>
<i>to be too crazy about her.</i>

00:42.440 --> 00:45.877
<i>As you can see, the Campbells</i>
<i>don't have nearly as much money</i>

00:46.080 --> 00:47.196
<i>as the Tates.</i>

00:48.040 --> 00:51.670
<i>They do, however,</i>
<i>have as many secrets.</i>

00:55.880 --> 00:57.837
<i>In last week's episode of</i> Soap,

00:58.040 --> 01:01.112
<i>the Tates and the Campbells,</i>
<i>who are all murder suspects,</i>

01:01.320 --> 01:02.834
<i>all suspect each other.</i>

01:03.040 --> 01:06.920
<i>Sheriff Tinkler, however,</i>
<i>has eliminated all suspects but one,</i>

01:07.120 --> 01:10.875
<i>and has arrested Corinne Tate</i>
<i>for the murder of Peter Campbell.</i>

01:11.080 --> 01:13.993
<i>The Tates are outraged</i>
<i>about Corinne's arrest,</i>

01:14.200 --> 01:16.351
<i>and the Campbells</i>
<i>don't know about it yet.</i>

01:16.560 --> 01:21.476
<i>Confused? You won't be</i>
<i>after this week's episode of</i> Soap.

01:26.600 --> 01:32.039
<i>We begin this week's episode</i>
<i>shortly after Corinne's arrest.</i>

01:32.240 --> 01:35.039
Oh, come on, Babette.
Now, you know it's illegal.

01:35.240 --> 01:38.631
Oh, please, illegal.
I told him he could go
around the world for $100.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.038
I'm a travel agent, for God's sake.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.833
Crazy.
Oh, please.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.236
Officer Tinkler, this is silly.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.070
It's hardly necessary
to put a sweet young girl in jail.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.840
That's just what I told him.

02:12.120 --> 02:15.511
Oh, no. She said, "I bet." Bet.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.235
Probably arrested for gambling.

Oh.

02:20.760 --> 02:21.760
[MOUTHS] <i>Oh.</i>

02:22.440 --> 02:25.956
Okay, Corinne, if you just give me
your personal belongings,
your purse, your jewellery.

02:26.160 --> 02:29.437
This is an outrage, Tinkler.
You have not one shred of proof.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.950
I'm going to sue you for false arrest,
I swear it.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.629
Look, we found her fingerprints
all over the place, Mr. Tate.

02:34.840 --> 02:38.072
Of course you did, you moron.
I live there.

02:38.280 --> 02:41.200
Oh, well, there are a lot of people
who knew you two
weren't getting along.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.189
Well, of course they weren't getting
along. They were living together.

02:45.400 --> 02:49.076
I mean, who ever heard of people
living together and getting along?

02:49.280 --> 02:52.034
It's people who don't live together
that get along.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.677
That's why one hears
about so few divorces among them.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.759
Come on, Corinne.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.919
Step over here, will you?
Just give me your thumb.
Put it right in here.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.520
What about bail, Tinkler?

03:04.720 --> 03:07.440
I'll arrange for a hearing.
Won't be until tomorrow, though.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.109
I want it now.
And I'm sorry, the judge is gone.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.959
She's gonna have to spend the night.

03:12.160 --> 03:15.232

to see her room, please.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.040
No.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.390
I'm sorry, Mrs. Tate.

My dear man, Corinne cannot sleep
without crossventilation.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.476
She has allergies.

03:24.680 --> 03:27.832
Now, look, Mrs. Tate,
this is a jail, not a hotel.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.111
Then she's not going.
She is going.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.516
Then I'm going with her.
I'm sorry.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.474
Why can't she come with me?
I'm her mother.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.320
Mr. Tate. Oh, come on, Corinne.

03:38.520 --> 03:39.795
You let me take her home,

03:40.000 --> 03:43.550

Nothing.

Right now, I guarantee you, I know
more about this crime than they do.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.832
For instance, I've narrowed it down
to one of two things:

05:28.040 --> 05:30.999
Peter was murdered
either by the Tates,

05:31.200 --> 05:34.716
or by a man
with more than two arms.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.836
Burt, how can you know that?

05:38.040 --> 05:40.953
How? Ha-ha. How?
My tests prove it. That's how.

05:41.160 --> 05:44.995
And notice, if you will,
I'm working under
very primitive conditions here. Huh?

05:45.200 --> 05:47.954
The police have a modern crime lab,
computers, whatnot, huh?

05:48.160 --> 05:50.550
And who comes up with the first big
break in the case? Me.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.760
Who? A civilian.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.874
We heard gunshots. What happened?
Nothing, Chuck.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.515
Oh, too bad. I thought
maybe Burt blew his head off.

Come on.
Hey, keep him quiet, will you?

did you figure out who did it,

Ha-ha-ha.

No, I figured out who did it.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.000
Oh, I can't wait to hear.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.600
The Tates did it.
All of them?

06:13.800 --> 06:17.760
That's right. One used a brick,
another a gun, another a knife.

she's the only one
who could've done it alone.

And what are you going to say?

22:08.640 --> 22:10.154
Tha... Ha-ha. Hi, there. I...

22:10.360 --> 22:11.481
Ahem. I was just practising.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.757
You can never be too prepared
in this business. Heh.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.191
Gotta keep the old
reflexes well-oiled,
If you know what I mean.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.472
Uh... Would you mind not waving
that thing around?

22:19.680 --> 22:21.034
Oh, don't worry.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.197
I'm in total control.

I want to see Corinne Tate.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.032
I'm sorry.
She's not having any visitors.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.278
My dear man, I am not a visitor.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.596

22:43.240 --> 22:45.914
You sound funny. You must be
one of them there foreigners, huh?

I am Ingrid Svenson,

22:49.800 --> 22:53.032
and I am Corinne's mother.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.356
What?
