WEBVTT

00:06.774 --> 00:08.117
It's here, dad.

00:08.273 --> 00:09.468
In the trap?

00:09.492 --> 00:11.706
I'd say titleist three.

00:11.899 --> 00:13.222
You know how good I feel?

00:13.481 --> 00:15.311
How good this morning is?

00:15.715 --> 00:17.236
No, how good?

00:17.365 --> 00:19.190
I'm going to blast out and two-putt.

00:19.214 --> 00:22.086
And I'm going to break 90
for the first time in my life.

00:22.721 --> 00:24.526
Did I tell you to have the
truck detailed while I'm away?

00:24.550 --> 00:25.681
Yes, sir.

00:25.718 --> 00:27.745
Last time I returned from deployment,

00:27.769 --> 00:30.680
I found a petrified
big mac under the seat.

00:30.879 --> 00:31.882
How long?

00:31.906 --> 00:33.668
Must have been there six months.

00:35.208 --> 00:37.449
How long will you be in Iraq this time?

00:38.221 --> 00:40.024
As long as it takes, Josh.

00:40.048 --> 00:41.732
18 months, maybe less.

00:41.756 --> 00:43.705
And then I go into teaching full time.

00:43.729 --> 00:47.511
And your mother and I can drive up
to Princeton every weekend to see you.

00:47.571 --> 00:49.850
Every other weekend will be fine.

00:51.794 --> 00:54.343
Are you going to swing or
should I get a beach towel?

00:55.161 --> 00:56.731
Keep your head down.

02:00.017 --> 02:02.636
One and a half teaspoons
is not sweet, McGee.

02:02.660 --> 02:07.213
I've seen my people pour three ounces
of sugar into a one-ounce espresso.

02:07.237 --> 02:09.782
Your people being long islanders?

02:09.806 --> 02:11.304
Romans.

02:11.742 --> 02:15.845
Inventors of the grain harvester,
the arch, modern plumbing.

02:16.121 --> 02:16.953
Plumbing.

02:16.977 --> 02:19.379
Every time I flush, I
will think of you, Tony.

02:19.403 --> 02:20.621
You and your people.

02:20.645 --> 02:23.722
I'd ask you to explain that,
but I really don't want to know.

02:23.746 --> 02:26.256
And I definitely don't want
to know what you're doing.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.740
Making cappuccino, Ziva.

02:28.764 --> 02:32.573
And educating probie as to what
Italy has contributed to the world.

02:32.597 --> 02:35.399
Oration, italian cinema...

02:35.478 --> 02:36.327
sports cars.

02:36.351 --> 02:38.385
Gold chains and chest hairs?

02:38.409 --> 02:41.773
And pasta in all its
sexy shapes and sizes.

02:41.797 --> 02:44.021
The Chinese invented pasta.

02:44.592 --> 02:46.628
Communist era propaganda.

02:49.251 --> 02:51.647
I assume Homeland
Security's been informed?

02:51.671 --> 02:52.591
Yes, Ma'am, they have.

02:52.615 --> 02:54.063
Will they be raising the threat level?

02:54.087 --> 02:55.596
Affirmative, to level orange.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.521
You have my direct line.

02:59.388 --> 03:00.272
Orange.

03:00.296 --> 03:02.941
Army navy club is a high-value target.

03:03.321 --> 03:04.852
High-value target?

03:04.876 --> 03:05.914
It's a terrorist's dream.

03:05.938 --> 03:09.483
You can't slice a tee shot without
hitting a congressman or a general.

03:09.507 --> 03:10.849
Or a colonel.

03:12.388 --> 03:14.432
He was set to deploy tomorrow.

03:15.660 --> 03:18.466
At least he got to spend
the last day with his son.

03:18.742 --> 03:20.657
That's one way of looking at it.

03:28.813 --> 03:30.681
Looks like we're late to the party.

03:30.705 --> 03:32.921
Assume 100-meter blast
radius from the sand trap.

03:32.945 --> 03:35.392
It's called a bunker,
boss, not a sand trap.

03:36.534 --> 03:38.513
Blast radius, hundred
meters, got it, boss.

03:38.537 --> 03:40.343
Probie, you got the
woods, I got the far side.

03:40.367 --> 03:41.630
Uh...

03:43.708 --> 03:45.182
what, McGee?

03:45.206 --> 03:46.971
Poison ivy, boss. I just...

03:46.995 --> 03:49.201
I look at the stuff and I break out.

03:49.413 --> 03:50.550
Don't look.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.511
- The zaka would be busy today.
- Zaka?

03:53.535 --> 03:58.177
Orthodox jews who volunteer to
collect body parts from terror attacks.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.909
Agent Gibbs,

04:02.493 --> 04:06.571
lieutenant colonel
Hollis Mann, army CID.

04:06.848 --> 04:08.703
- I believe your director called.
- She did.

04:08.727 --> 04:11.807
- Officer Ziva David.
- Ziva David, yes, I know.

04:11.925 --> 04:14.974
Army criminal investigative
division has excellent intel.

04:14.998 --> 04:17.418
Good. You can use it to
support our investigation.

04:17.442 --> 04:19.495
Our joint investigation.

04:19.519 --> 04:20.857
With army in the lead.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.182
This isn't the navy-army
club, it's the army-navy club.

04:24.206 --> 04:25.232
Yeah.

04:26.143 --> 04:29.942
That is a dead marine
at the army-navy club.

04:45.143 --> 04:47.901
I had EOD sweep the
rest of the sand traps.

04:47.925 --> 04:48.842
Bunkers.

04:48.866 --> 04:49.579
Excuse me?

04:49.603 --> 04:51.793
They call them bunkers, not sand traps.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.929
The colonel's son said he saw what he
thought was a spiderweb in the bunker.

04:55.953 --> 04:56.828
Trip wire?

04:56.852 --> 04:57.675
Possibly.

04:57.699 --> 04:59.770
There's not much to go on with this one.

04:59.794 --> 05:01.949
Of course, we've got
a lot of land to cover.

05:01.973 --> 05:04.205
- 18 holes on a golf course.
- Yep.

05:04.229 --> 05:05.489
You want to divide them up?

05:05.513 --> 05:07.492
Sure, we'll take the crime scene.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.820
You and your people can
take the other 17 holes.

05:12.175 --> 05:15.764
You're not taking away my
crime scene. End of story.

05:15.929 --> 05:17.351
But if you ask nicely,

05:17.375 --> 05:19.409
I might just give you the body.

05:20.046 --> 05:21.440
Well...

05:22.109 --> 05:26.654
I don't really have to ask,
seeing as my M.E. got here first.

05:26.678 --> 05:28.020
Okay.

05:29.218 --> 05:32.662
If this is going to be a pissing
match, you better bring an umbrella.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.094
Whoa-ho!

05:35.118 --> 05:37.077
Got some good news, boss.

05:38.778 --> 05:39.644
Did I miss something?

05:39.668 --> 05:42.114
Gibbs just found his fourth ex-wife.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.100
What do you got, DiNozzo?

05:44.124 --> 05:45.947
Found this off the next tee.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.168
It was outside the blast radius.
Wind must have carried it.

05:48.192 --> 05:49.623
Looks like part of a detonator.

05:49.647 --> 05:51.770
I checked the neighboring tees myself.

05:51.794 --> 05:54.224
Well, maybe you shouldhave
checked the trash cans.

05:54.248 --> 05:56.401
Looks like a hole in one, boss.

05:57.563 --> 05:59.691
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

06:01.231 --> 06:04.762
Myself. I have difficulty
getting out of the sand.

06:04.786 --> 06:06.979
I suppose it's because
I don't practice enough.

06:07.003 --> 06:08.912
I mean, I dig my feet in...

06:08.936 --> 06:12.126
I open the club face, but then
I forget to follow through.

06:12.150 --> 06:14.048
And the ball just goes a couple of feet.

06:14.072 --> 06:17.515
Not nearly as far as
you traveled, my friend.

06:17.539 --> 06:19.467
Is he talking to himself?

06:19.717 --> 06:20.746
The body.

06:20.770 --> 06:26.379
Ah, colonel, your C.O. just called.
Requested copies of my autopsy report.

06:26.403 --> 06:27.779
Gibbs.

06:28.706 --> 06:30.026
The report?

06:30.050 --> 06:31.213
Yeah, well...

06:31.237 --> 06:35.404
the cause of death appears
to be just what you see here.

06:35.428 --> 06:38.002
Explosive dismemberment.

06:38.026 --> 06:39.363
Yeah, got that part.

06:39.387 --> 06:42.568
What we don't have are traceable
fragments from that explosion.

06:42.592 --> 06:46.945
Yes, Abby was complaining about the dearth
of physical evidence from the crime scene.

06:46.969 --> 06:48.811
Present company excepted, of course.

06:48.835 --> 06:50.159
Bomb shell was plastic.

06:50.183 --> 06:52.376
Which means the fragments disintegrated.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.197
Yes, but luckily for
you, not all of them.

06:55.221 --> 06:59.319
As the ancients soon discovered,
fire and water do not mix.

06:59.343 --> 07:03.047
The human body is
over two-thirds water.

07:03.071 --> 07:06.250
Some of the burning
fragments were cooled

07:06.274 --> 07:09.424
by the interstitial liquid
in the colonel's tissue

07:09.448 --> 07:12.221
before they could disintegrate.

07:13.037 --> 07:14.712
Get that to Abby.

07:17.302 --> 07:18.764
Thank you.

07:22.712 --> 07:24.645
I can't believe he's gone.

07:27.690 --> 07:31.155
It's like I hear myself say that,
but I know it's a stupid thing to say.

07:31.375 --> 07:33.068
It's not stupid, Josh.

07:35.067 --> 07:37.321
If you told me he was still alive,

07:38.038 --> 07:40.124
that what I saw was a trick...

07:41.406 --> 07:43.459
I think I'd believe you.

07:47.381 --> 07:50.007
Look, maybe we should
finish this tomorrow.

07:51.924 --> 07:54.262
I'll be at Princeton tomorrow.

07:56.515 --> 07:59.481
Dad wouldn't want me to
miss my first day of classes.

08:01.395 --> 08:02.540
Okay.

08:05.021 --> 08:08.068
You saw a spiderweb in
the bunker, you said?

08:08.092 --> 08:10.638
Yeah, at least I thought so.

08:11.341 --> 08:15.620
Until my dad hit it. I
should have said something.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.726
There was nothing you could have done.

08:19.736 --> 08:22.559
That's another one of those
stupid things people say.

08:23.483 --> 08:25.349
Well, I got a million of them.

08:25.385 --> 08:27.917
You should ask my
coworkers, they'll tell you.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.289
Okay, what else you got?

08:33.313 --> 08:34.951
Everything happens for a reason.

08:34.975 --> 08:38.631
Yeah, that would have
really pissed me off.

08:39.341 --> 08:40.738
But you can do better.

08:40.761 --> 08:44.235
When your time is up your time is up.

08:44.259 --> 08:46.106
Hope you've got more skills than that.

08:47.479 --> 08:50.046
In the immortal words of Elvis Costello,

08:50.279 --> 08:53.089
"oh, accidents will happen."

08:54.184 --> 08:56.023
Oh, yeah.

08:56.170 --> 09:01.058
I probably would have stuck my fist
through your skull if you had said that.

09:01.591 --> 09:03.973
Soft skull, actually.

09:04.026 --> 09:06.370
Except this wasn't an accident, was it?

09:08.386 --> 09:09.454
No.

09:10.338 --> 09:14.460
I thought we were fighting them over there
so we didn't have to fight them over here.

09:16.452 --> 09:18.547
Maybe they need some more help, huh?

09:19.846 --> 09:22.309
Look, you just focus on Princeton.

09:22.589 --> 09:24.462
We'll find who did this.

09:24.901 --> 09:26.827
Like you found Bin Laden?

09:33.600 --> 09:35.031
- There it is.
- Okay, good.

09:35.055 --> 09:36.654
Punch in on that.

09:36.862 --> 09:38.434
You can read the entire license plate.

09:38.458 --> 09:39.821
I'll update the bolo.

09:39.845 --> 09:40.685
Bolo for what?

09:40.709 --> 09:42.987
Well, we cleared the course,
we vetted everyone as they left,

09:43.011 --> 09:46.224
but we don't have any record
of this '99 toyota leaving.

09:46.248 --> 09:47.876
The owner's a green skeeper at the club.

09:47.900 --> 09:51.050
He must have used an old service entrance
and snuck out before we covered them all.

09:51.074 --> 09:52.525
Nice catch, McGee.

09:52.732 --> 09:54.493
No, it's my catch.

09:54.517 --> 09:57.006
Let's see if we can
get an address on this.

09:57.171 --> 10:00.023
Was it just me, or did
the secdef seem nervous?

10:00.047 --> 10:02.305
Probably has a tee time tomorrow.

10:03.886 --> 10:05.400
What's she like?

10:08.119 --> 10:10.361
I just meant, is she up to the job?

10:11.353 --> 10:12.915
I'll let you know.

10:15.926 --> 10:16.758
Yeah, Gibbs...

10:16.782 --> 10:18.641
Hey, boss, DiNozzo here.

10:20.305 --> 10:22.118
Hey, DiNozzo!

10:26.011 --> 10:27.867
Hey, that's weird, 'cause I...

10:27.891 --> 10:29.233
I thought you were still in MTAC.

10:29.257 --> 10:30.016
What do you want?

10:30.040 --> 10:31.189
Uh... we...

10:31.213 --> 10:35.311
just found an unaccounted for
vehicle from the army-navy club.

10:46.823 --> 10:48.064
DiNozzo...

10:48.088 --> 10:52.875
He's already in CID custody, agent Gibbs.
My people can handle the interrogation.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.460
What are you doing?

10:57.558 --> 10:58.835
Divorced, right?

10:58.859 --> 10:59.853
Three times.

10:59.877 --> 11:01.380
Only three?

11:03.353 --> 11:06.162
Well, I'll be sure to let my
superiors know how you assisted.

11:06.186 --> 11:07.486
Stand clear!

11:08.091 --> 11:09.416
Opening!

11:12.401 --> 11:13.923
All clear.

11:16.403 --> 11:17.711
Marijuana.

11:18.235 --> 11:20.398
Okay, drugs.

11:20.422 --> 11:22.552
Doesn't mean he didn't plant the bomb.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.551
You can have that interrogation.

11:26.921 --> 11:28.698
I'll look for who did.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.680
Agent Gibbs!

11:44.084 --> 11:47.647
I... I've been ringing your
bell for the last three minutes.

11:47.834 --> 11:50.177
Yeah. I've been meaning to fix that.

11:50.201 --> 11:51.949
Well, the door was unlocked, so...

11:51.973 --> 11:54.983
so this would be trespassing,
not breaking and entering.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.358
Uh-huh.

11:59.084 --> 12:00.246
"Kelly"?

12:01.367 --> 12:03.711
Is there a reason you
broke into my house?

12:04.625 --> 12:09.287
This is a joint investigation. I thought
maybe we could share some information.

12:11.721 --> 12:12.738
Beer?

12:14.229 --> 12:15.678
Beer? Uh.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.951
Sure.

12:18.975 --> 12:22.747
I got the results on the
swabs from the toyota.

12:22.810 --> 12:27.487
There were traces of diesel
fuel and, uh, fertilizer.

12:27.908 --> 12:31.316
Same thing that McVeigh used to, uh...

12:31.420 --> 12:34.056
blow up the federal
building in oklahoma.

12:34.080 --> 12:34.809
Yeah.

12:34.833 --> 12:37.690
Guy driving the toyota
was a greenskeeper.

12:37.714 --> 12:42.168
I know. He's around fertilizer
and diesel fuel all day.

12:43.269 --> 12:44.966
It was a bad lead.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.248
Anything you'd like to share?

12:46.272 --> 12:48.063
Well, I got some sardines upstair

12:48.087 --> 12:49.892
I meant about the case.

12:49.916 --> 12:52.307
But, then, you knew that.

12:54.599 --> 12:55.915
Girlfriend.

12:56.457 --> 12:59.842
Is, uh, Kelly your... your girlfriend?

13:04.993 --> 13:06.113
Okay...

13:06.431 --> 13:07.431
Look...

13:07.801 --> 13:10.429
CID intel did a profile on you for me.

13:10.453 --> 13:13.687
I know you flaunt authority,
especially in front of a female.

13:13.735 --> 13:15.141
A female write that, too?

13:15.165 --> 13:16.216
Yep.

13:16.475 --> 13:18.851
She also wrote you were
a sniper, a good one,

13:18.875 --> 13:21.399
but your eyesight's
shot, you're injury-prone,

13:21.423 --> 13:23.843
if not in a state of near
death-wish fulfillment,

13:23.867 --> 13:28.096
and though you're pressured and impatient,
you're also passionate and loyal,

13:28.120 --> 13:31.137
in spite of the fact that
you don't trust anyone.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.037
You are gonna have to trust me.

13:37.765 --> 13:41.142
Is there anything I should know
about you before we get involved?

13:42.176 --> 13:43.655
Involved?

13:44.752 --> 13:46.032
In the case.

13:47.554 --> 13:51.701
You can have NCIS intel do a
profile on me, if you'd like.

13:52.448 --> 13:53.980
Oh, I could.

13:58.089 --> 14:00.159
But I like surprises.

14:05.284 --> 14:07.306
This hypothesis states

14:07.330 --> 14:10.214
that the fate of
transplanted embryonic cells

14:10.238 --> 14:14.345
is independent of their
new position in the embryo.

14:14.369 --> 14:16.209
The mosaic hypothesis.

14:16.233 --> 14:19.417
I'm sorry, I'm going to
need the complete answer.

14:19.610 --> 14:23.853
What is the mosaic hypothesis?

14:23.877 --> 14:26.896
Correct! Hot and smart.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.574
The female version of me.

14:28.598 --> 14:29.938
Oh!

14:30.522 --> 14:32.711
So you think I'm ready
for the exam tomorrow?

14:32.735 --> 14:35.155
Oh, I have 20 bucks saying
that you're gonna set the curve.

14:35.179 --> 14:37.851
Okay, that's... good to hear.

14:37.875 --> 14:43.057
Because, uh, that means it's my
turn to ask you some questions.

14:44.270 --> 14:45.829
Fire away.

14:45.853 --> 14:48.698
All right, how's a, uh, kind of cute,

14:49.115 --> 14:53.161
definitely charming guy like you who
does some pretty bad impersonations...

14:53.185 --> 14:56.919
I don't know what that
means, but I thank you.

14:56.943 --> 14:57.608
Yeah...

14:57.632 --> 15:00.455
Manage to stay single for so long?

15:00.761 --> 15:02.809
Oh, you're-you're gonna
ask a real question?

15:02.833 --> 15:04.007
That's a real question.

15:04.031 --> 15:05.925
- Well, ah.
- Um

15:06.227 --> 15:08.485
what are commitment issues?

15:10.712 --> 15:11.870
Mm-mm, not buying it.

15:11.894 --> 15:12.486
Really?

15:12.510 --> 15:13.513
Mm-mm.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.042
And why is that?

15:15.170 --> 15:16.430
In the last hour...

15:16.454 --> 15:17.119
yeah?

15:17.143 --> 15:19.456
At least a dozen hot
coeds have walked by.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.587
Your eyes haven't wandered once.

15:21.935 --> 15:23.157
Really?

15:24.177 --> 15:26.286
Well, obviously, yours have.

15:28.800 --> 15:32.854
Don't get your hopes
up. I'm a very, um...

15:33.493 --> 15:35.224
traditional girl.

15:35.248 --> 15:37.639
Well, so was Anne Heche.

15:39.107 --> 15:42.105
You still haven't
answered my question, Tony.

15:43.457 --> 15:44.849
Okay.

15:45.968 --> 15:47.327
Okay.

15:47.577 --> 15:48.774
Well...

15:51.010 --> 15:54.655
I suppose that I am patiently waiting...

15:54.802 --> 15:56.589
to find the right girl.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.669
You think you'll, uh, ever find her?

16:00.287 --> 16:02.802
I'm getting more and
me confident by the day.

16:25.789 --> 16:30.302
Ah, and to think people once questioned the
need for a video camera in a cell phone.

16:30.326 --> 16:31.531
Tony!

16:32.957 --> 16:34.749
Wait till you see this.

16:34.846 --> 16:36.556
Any ideas?

16:37.058 --> 16:39.200
He's definitely not making cappuccino.

16:39.224 --> 16:41.231
There's no way he's got an STD.

16:41.255 --> 16:44.047
I was itching, it's poison
ivy and it's spreading, okay?

16:44.071 --> 16:46.877
This is your second tango
with the vicious weed, McGee.

16:46.901 --> 16:48.937
Maybe you ought to learn
what that stuff looks like.

16:48.961 --> 16:49.836
And avoid it.

16:49.860 --> 16:51.528
I thought I did.

16:52.082 --> 16:53.273
This is killing me.

16:53.297 --> 16:56.096
When Gibbs told me to check out the
forest, I should've just told him...

16:56.120 --> 16:57.896
Tell me what, McGee?

16:58.626 --> 16:59.608
No!

16:59.632 --> 17:01.967
Well, that probably would
have been a good idea.

17:02.037 --> 17:04.534
Baking soda and vinegar,
you make a paste, slop it on.

17:04.558 --> 17:06.546
Okay. Thank you. Thank you boss.

17:06.569 --> 17:08.556
Not now, McGee.

17:08.729 --> 17:11.141
After we catch the terrorists.

17:11.903 --> 17:14.520
That could be a while. All
the club guests check out,

17:14.544 --> 17:16.874
local LEOs report no
unusual activy in the area.

17:16.897 --> 17:17.625
DiNozzo?

17:17.648 --> 17:20.173
I've gone through the last month
of the club's video surveillance.

17:20.196 --> 17:22.449
If the terrorist cell
was casing the joint,

17:22.473 --> 17:24.259
they hid their tracks pretty well.

17:24.282 --> 17:25.346
Your contact at interpol?

17:25.369 --> 17:28.880
Uh, said there was almost no uptick
in chatter prior to the explosion.

17:28.904 --> 17:31.044
Could be homegrown bad boys, boss.

17:31.068 --> 17:33.512
So there should be some
chatter, no matter who it is.

17:33.536 --> 17:35.019
However this cell is operating,

17:35.043 --> 17:37.897
they found a way to do so without
leaving a shred of evidence.

17:38.569 --> 17:40.511
Other than a dead marine.

17:42.323 --> 17:43.768
Nice.

17:44.108 --> 17:47.508
Gibbs wanted me to see if you've finished
processing the crime scene evidence yet.

17:47.532 --> 17:50.731
I have, but Gibbs is not
gonna like this. Exhibit A.

17:50.755 --> 17:53.637
These are the bomb fragments that
Ducky pulled from colonel Cooper.

17:53.661 --> 17:56.988
It's plastic but not your
usual petroleum-based,

17:57.012 --> 17:58.546
wreck-the-environment polymer.

17:58.570 --> 18:01.107
It's made out of... corn.

18:01.301 --> 18:02.328
It's biodegradable.

18:02.352 --> 18:05.504
Which explains why it
disintegrated so much in the blast.

18:05.528 --> 18:06.421
What are you doing?

18:06.445 --> 18:07.978
Well, actually, I have...

18:08.002 --> 18:09.453
you know what?

18:10.019 --> 18:11.228
I don't want to know.

18:11.252 --> 18:14.924
It's green technology, mostly
used for making milk containers.

18:14.948 --> 18:19.940
So the best guess is that the bad guys
used a jug as casement for the explosives.

18:19.964 --> 18:21.451
Okay, I do want to know.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.727
I have poison ivy, and it's killing me.

18:24.210 --> 18:25.732
My secret remedy.

18:26.581 --> 18:27.820
Ooh, what is it?

18:27.844 --> 18:30.165
Carbonic acid. You just smear it on.

18:30.189 --> 18:32.441
I am not gonna put acid on my...

18:32.973 --> 18:33.660
boys.

18:33.684 --> 18:34.884
Relax, McGee.

18:34.908 --> 18:40.012
It's just sodium bicarbonate
and oxidized ethanol.

18:40.637 --> 18:42.587
Baking soda and white vinegar.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.556
Ah. I think Gibbs knows your secret
remedy, he told me to do the same thing.

18:46.580 --> 18:48.018
Well, you should've listened.

18:48.042 --> 18:50.034
Go ahead, rub it in. I'll wait.

18:52.103 --> 18:53.189
Okay.

18:54.213 --> 18:56.775
So, uh, milk jug, do we got a trace yet?

18:56.799 --> 18:58.793
The green revolution has begun, McGee.

18:58.817 --> 19:01.937
It's too wildly available to
narrow down a purchase place.

19:01.961 --> 19:04.973
I had the same problem with this
piece of detonator that Tony found.

19:04.997 --> 19:06.230
You can buy this anywhere.

19:06.254 --> 19:08.258
It's an off-the-shelf fuse.

19:08.282 --> 19:11.695
I got excited, 'cause I thought I'd found
tissue on it that might match the suspect,

19:11.719 --> 19:15.060
but... it was too degraded
from the blast to get any DNA.

19:17.230 --> 19:22.347
You're right, Gibbs is... not gonna
like this, but right now I don't care.

19:23.892 --> 19:26.090
Ah. Thank you.

19:26.723 --> 19:29.435
Approaching contact
point. Intercept in five.

19:34.821 --> 19:36.873
Intercept successful. Commencing search.

19:36.897 --> 19:39.010
Out of the car! Out of the car!

19:39.780 --> 19:41.738
Update, major thompson.

19:41.783 --> 19:44.927
Negative on grant way.
I repeat, negative.

19:46.155 --> 19:49.627
Director, agent Gibbs is
attempting to access MTAC.

19:49.725 --> 19:50.899
Go dark.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.093
Let him in.

19:57.047 --> 19:58.692
Change the locks on me?

19:58.716 --> 20:01.535
Threat level orange,
remember? We're on lockdown.

20:01.559 --> 20:03.165
Unless you have some good news for me.

20:03.189 --> 20:06.579
All I've got is 300 wasted man-hours.
We're looking in the wrong direction.

20:06.603 --> 20:09.827
Well, I might be able to point
you the right one. Danielle?

20:12.156 --> 20:15.655
This just came from the CIA
regarding the golf course bombing.

20:17.797 --> 20:20.958
A suspected homegrown terrorist cell?

20:21.140 --> 20:22.822
Suspected? By who?

20:22.846 --> 20:24.371
A CIA informant.

20:24.395 --> 20:26.372
Why are we just hearing about this now?

20:26.396 --> 20:28.748
Unfortunately, probably
the same reason why

20:28.772 --> 20:31.787
we didn't hear about those
flying lessons until after 9/11.

20:31.811 --> 20:33.939
I've informed army CID as well.

20:33.963 --> 20:36.093
Colonel Mann will meet you on-site.

20:36.919 --> 20:39.476
Your men all the way
around the building.

20:41.507 --> 20:44.737
CID beat us to the punch
again. That's twice in one week.

20:44.841 --> 20:47.268
I didn't know this was a race, DiNozzo.

20:47.292 --> 20:50.397
Oh, no, it's not, I'm just not
used to these joint efforts.

20:52.424 --> 20:54.682
Oh, glad to see you finally made it.

20:54.846 --> 20:58.285
To be honest, I thought you'd beat
me here and head in without me.

20:58.309 --> 21:00.887
Thought you said I was
the one with trust issues.

21:06.542 --> 21:07.742
Clear!

21:07.766 --> 21:09.202
Clear here!

21:09.726 --> 21:10.618
Oh, that's original.

21:10.642 --> 21:14.087
Metro subway maps, national
monuments, bridge blueprints.

21:14.111 --> 21:15.157
Potential targets.

21:15.181 --> 21:17.423
They sure as hell weren't sightseeing.

21:17.447 --> 21:20.612
Uh, I think I know who
their target is, boss.

21:24.618 --> 21:25.823
Us.

21:34.675 --> 21:36.732
All right, secure the building now!

21:36.756 --> 21:41.312
Ziva, Tony, out the back door!
No one in until EOD gets here.

21:41.336 --> 21:43.087
Move back!

21:53.857 --> 21:56.885
Ziva, hey, what the hell are you doing?

21:57.735 --> 21:58.789
I can disarm it.

21:58.813 --> 22:01.910
Okay, well, great. Let's go
outside and talk about this.

22:01.934 --> 22:04.430
If it detonates before EOD gets here,

22:04.454 --> 22:05.517
we'll lose evidence.

22:05.541 --> 22:08.179
Well, what a bummer.
It'd be a real shame.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.605
Ziva! Ziva!

22:10.834 --> 22:13.900
This has to be the stupidest thing
any human being has ever done.

22:13.924 --> 22:15.479
Then why are you following me, Tony?

22:15.503 --> 22:17.402
I don't freakin' know.

22:18.581 --> 22:19.897
God!

22:28.107 --> 22:29.888
Here, hold this.

22:30.707 --> 22:33.676
Do you have any idea what's going
to happen if this cell phone rings?

22:44.973 --> 22:47.171
I can see down your shirt right now.

22:48.733 --> 22:51.394
I don't think your new
girlfriend would like that.

22:51.695 --> 22:54.565
What are you talking about? I don't
know what you're talking about.

22:54.730 --> 23:00.673
I'm talking about you and the fact that you no
longer stare at every woman when they pass you by.

23:00.863 --> 23:03.429
Well, I'm looking down
your shirt right now.

23:03.453 --> 23:04.947
See anything good?

23:04.991 --> 23:07.396
Yeah, real good.

23:07.420 --> 23:10.290
But I'm not entirely
sure it's worth dying...

23:10.737 --> 23:12.060
over.

23:12.430 --> 23:15.165
Not worth dying over.

23:16.187 --> 23:17.913
I'll remember that.

23:18.489 --> 23:20.130
What if I said it was?

23:20.466 --> 23:22.300
Then now you'll never know.

23:24.725 --> 23:26.665
The bomb was set to go off
when the cell was called.

23:26.689 --> 23:29.795
It's prepaid and
disposable. Never been used.

23:30.247 --> 23:31.513
So there's no call log.

23:31.537 --> 23:33.839
Thanks to our bomb-disposal expert,

23:33.863 --> 23:35.260
we still have plenty to work with.

23:35.284 --> 23:37.338
Looks like two or three
people were staying there.

23:37.362 --> 23:38.767
Abby's processing it.

23:38.791 --> 23:40.216
It's a nice job, Ziva.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.988
You do anything like that ever again,

23:42.012 --> 23:44.475
I'll kick your ass back to Israel.

23:44.499 --> 23:48.199
CIA refuses to let us talk
to their source directly.

23:48.223 --> 23:48.927
Protected?

23:48.951 --> 23:51.101
The right hand still isn't
talking to the left hand and

23:51.125 --> 23:53.939
we have no idea what
the source actually said.

23:53.963 --> 23:54.821
Oh, McGee?

23:54.845 --> 23:56.812
Yeah, almost there, boss.

23:57.207 --> 24:00.234
Oh, you're not hacking the CIA?

24:00.334 --> 24:00.875
No, no, no,

24:00.899 --> 24:02.219
Homeland Security.

24:02.243 --> 24:04.355
They post a redundant CIA archive.

24:04.379 --> 24:07.026
All right, my superiors
are not going to like this.

24:07.050 --> 24:08.235
Don't tell 'em.

24:11.147 --> 24:14.878
Smart and devious, it's
a dangerous combination.

24:15.751 --> 24:18.103
You forgot "charming."

24:20.050 --> 24:20.754
I'm in.

24:20.778 --> 24:22.251
No, I didn't.

24:24.669 --> 24:28.906
Okay, informant's name is Mamoun Sharif.

24:28.930 --> 24:33.787
Native of Lebanon. Arsted in Beirut
for extortion, cooperated with Interpol.

24:33.811 --> 24:37.183
Helped break a stolen weapons
ring on one of our bases in Turkey.

24:37.207 --> 24:39.583
CIA moved him to the States.

24:39.607 --> 24:45.885
Been on retainer ever since. Has a small
convenience store in Rosslyn, Virginia.

24:45.909 --> 24:47.208
Address.

24:47.428 --> 24:49.356
You bring anything other than ACUs?

24:49.380 --> 24:51.450
Would you like me to wear a dress?

24:55.685 --> 24:56.959
Thank you.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.419
Hey, what did I tell you?!

24:59.443 --> 25:01.777
The owner takes this out of my pocket.

25:01.801 --> 25:05.459
The next time I'm catching you, I'm
calling the police. Out the back!

25:07.307 --> 25:09.557
So don't let me catch you.

25:10.807 --> 25:12.249
Thank you.

25:15.731 --> 25:18.704
It still comes out of
your pocket, doesn't it?

25:18.755 --> 25:19.887
Yes.

25:19.911 --> 25:23.763
But where I was born, it is a
sin to turn away a hungry man.

25:23.787 --> 25:26.081
Now what can I help you with?

25:26.682 --> 25:29.005
Lieutenant colonel
Hollis Mann, army CID.

25:29.029 --> 25:29.580
Put that away!

25:29.604 --> 25:33.448
We have a couple of questions for you
about a recent tip you gave the CIA.

25:33.472 --> 25:34.852
Are you trying to get me killed?!

25:34.876 --> 25:36.363
You can't contact me here!

25:36.387 --> 25:38.937
We understand the need
for confidentiality.

25:38.961 --> 25:41.450
Just want to know how you
heard about the warehouse.

25:43.107 --> 25:44.093
Who am I talking to?

25:44.117 --> 25:45.322
Me - Me.

25:47.917 --> 25:49.670
I hear things, okay?

25:49.694 --> 25:52.550
In the mosque, in the
store, on the street.

25:52.574 --> 25:53.321
Names.

25:53.345 --> 25:54.583
Forget it.

25:54.607 --> 25:57.999
I hear things from people who
hear things; Innocent people.

25:58.023 --> 26:01.701
Names I will not give. I
know what happens nowadays.

26:01.725 --> 26:05.155
I am taking a big enough risk
myself talking to your CIA.

26:05.179 --> 26:07.741
Which you're well compensated for.

26:08.094 --> 26:10.219
We all have to make a living.

26:14.537 --> 26:17.138
.38 super auto colt.

26:17.182 --> 26:18.875
It's a bad neighborhood.

26:19.109 --> 26:20.714
You got a license?

26:23.123 --> 26:24.294
Okay.

26:24.604 --> 26:26.750
Your country has been good to me.

26:26.774 --> 26:32.737
The man I heard talking in my store
about the golf course two days ago

26:33.376 --> 26:34.883
buying ring dings...

26:34.907 --> 26:38.142
I'm not so sure he's one
of those innocent people.

26:38.166 --> 26:39.414
Why?

26:40.617 --> 26:43.304
Because of what he
called the golf course.

26:45.014 --> 26:46.562
"The beginning."

26:52.357 --> 26:55.357
Look, quick, look. Do you see that?

26:55.381 --> 26:56.860
See what?

26:56.930 --> 26:59.560
Gibbs let her go first. He
never lets anyone go first.

26:59.584 --> 27:01.018
Get this to Abby.

27:01.525 --> 27:04.025
I.D. on anyone buying a slurpy.

27:05.782 --> 27:06.434
Where's DiNozzo?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.084
Had a doctor's appointment.

27:08.108 --> 27:10.630
I want him on that grocery store.

27:10.654 --> 27:12.895
He said he'd be back asap.

27:23.332 --> 27:24.112
McGee?

27:24.136 --> 27:26.769
You're not really with
a doctor, are you, Tony?

27:26.888 --> 27:28.814
As a matter of fact, I am.

27:28.838 --> 27:32.219
Well, Gibbs keeps looking
at your desk and his watch.

27:32.243 --> 27:33.989
Tell him I'll be right there.

27:34.013 --> 27:35.093
You okay?

27:35.117 --> 27:36.848
I was fine.

27:45.624 --> 27:47.257
When did you leave?

27:49.566 --> 27:53.810
Well, I'm a cheap date.

27:54.591 --> 27:56.239
This is a date?

27:57.088 --> 27:59.701
Is a figure of speech, agent Gibbs.

28:00.668 --> 28:04.041
So I got the food.
Did you solve the case?

28:04.065 --> 28:08.381
I was about to, till you
broke my concentration.

28:09.963 --> 28:11.767
That easy to break, huh?

28:12.154 --> 28:13.622
When I'm hungry.

28:17.382 --> 28:20.787
I thought I was close
to a break, but now...

28:22.167 --> 28:24.524
I've got more questions than answers.

28:24.885 --> 28:27.902
And colonel Cooper, was
he specifically targeted?

28:27.926 --> 28:29.555
No way to know who'd be in the bunker.

28:29.579 --> 28:32.803
Okay, so the target is random
which says "terrorist attack."

28:32.827 --> 28:35.245
Except the explosive
was not designed to kill.

28:35.269 --> 28:37.331
The guy in the morgue would
probably disagree with that.

28:37.355 --> 28:40.672
No, I mean, if the terrorists had
packed the bomb full of shrapnel

28:40.696 --> 28:43.377
like they usually do, then
the son would be dead, too.

28:43.401 --> 28:45.800
And make the bomb easier to detect.

28:48.664 --> 28:53.225
Which means the terrorists
priority's clearly to avoid detection.

28:53.372 --> 28:55.620
Explains a lack of chatter.

28:57.130 --> 29:02.581
So if you're that busy covering your tracks, why do
you write "death to america" all over your hideout?

29:07.487 --> 29:09.003
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

29:09.027 --> 29:10.535
More questions than answers.

29:10.559 --> 29:12.214
Sign of weakness.

29:13.908 --> 29:16.534
I thought it took strength to apologize.

29:23.727 --> 29:25.478
Shouldn't you be packing?

29:25.642 --> 29:27.599
My mom called you, didn't she?

29:29.488 --> 29:31.070
What did she tell you?

29:31.508 --> 29:33.228
That you're not going to Princeton.

29:33.252 --> 29:34.507
She's right.

29:38.021 --> 29:39.923
Coltrane.

29:39.947 --> 29:44.432
I wouldn't have really pegged
you for a jazz man, Josh.

29:46.818 --> 29:51.385
Dad played Coltrane and Miles Davis every
sunday for as long as I can remember.

29:51.499 --> 29:54.354
The same albums over and over.

29:54.450 --> 29:55.770
Used to drive me nuts.

29:55.794 --> 29:59.426
Well, military man set in his routines.

29:59.450 --> 30:03.972
The funny thing is, the first time he was
deployed, I found myself playing those same albums.

30:07.367 --> 30:10.700
Next thing I knew, he was home
and we were listening together.

30:11.258 --> 30:14.206
I know this must be a pretty
difficult time for you.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.818
If you're here to talk me
out of joining the marines...

30:16.842 --> 30:19.656
I would never talk someone
out of joining the corps.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.265
It's an honor to serve your country.

30:21.289 --> 30:23.526
Good. Glad that's settled.

30:23.827 --> 30:26.783
I would ask one question, though.

30:27.307 --> 30:28.897
What's the big rush?

30:29.002 --> 30:31.499
You know what? You're
probably right. I should...

30:31.523 --> 30:34.985
wait a little longer. What's
a few more dead colonels?

30:35.009 --> 30:36.260
I understand that you're pissed off.

30:36.284 --> 30:40.201
Pissed off?! They killed
my dad! How would you feel?!

30:41.096 --> 30:43.165
I would want justice,

30:43.946 --> 30:45.660
but you're looking for revenge.

30:45.684 --> 30:47.069
You're damn right.

30:47.191 --> 30:49.319
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

30:49.343 --> 30:52.507
Which just leaves you with a
bunch of toothless, blind people.

30:52.658 --> 30:54.826
So you just make a joke and do nothing?

30:54.850 --> 30:58.987
I would do... whatever it takes.

31:01.236 --> 31:04.354
But there is a right time...

31:05.135 --> 31:06.845
a right place.

31:10.761 --> 31:12.634
And this is not the time.

31:13.222 --> 31:14.624
Not for you.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.957
Homeland Security says there's an uptick in
chatter. Something is definitely going on.

31:25.981 --> 31:28.215
Better have a fatal disease, DiNozzo.

31:28.239 --> 31:30.342
Josh's mom called. He's
looking for payback.

31:30.366 --> 31:34.351
Wants to skip Princeton and join the
marines. I went to talk him out of it.

31:34.439 --> 31:35.541
Did you?

31:35.787 --> 31:36.696
I don't know, boss.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.118
McGee, turn this up. Gibbs?

31:38.142 --> 31:41.673
A fiery explosion has completely
engulfed a Rosslyn convenience store.

31:41.697 --> 31:45.588
The store's owner is believed to have
been inside at the time of the blast.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.494
That's Sharif's place.

31:56.783 --> 31:58.470
First the friendly links,

31:58.494 --> 32:00.548
now the neighborhood convenience store.

32:00.572 --> 32:03.121
It's such tragedies as your mr. Sharif,

32:03.145 --> 32:05.926
that make my mother
afraid to leave the house,

32:05.950 --> 32:09.064
which does not bode
well for me, I'm afraid.

32:09.088 --> 32:12.843
Your visit is premature. I'm still waiting
for the rest of him to be delivered.

32:12.867 --> 32:15.219
Mm... Until then, you have...

32:15.873 --> 32:17.699
well, the obvious. Same as before.

32:17.723 --> 32:23.070
Except this time the dismemberment was
caused by some form of high-impact explosive.

32:23.094 --> 32:25.420
His dismembermt, but not his death.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.368
Correct, colonel. Yeah, as you can see,

32:27.392 --> 32:31.740
he was the pugilist-at-rest
posture at the time of his demise.

32:31.764 --> 32:36.897
This praying mantis posture is one
of man's oldest defensive positions,

32:36.921 --> 32:41.381
almost always assumed when
battling intense heat and flame.

32:42.436 --> 32:44.126
So Sharif was burned alive.

32:44.150 --> 32:45.829
Place was torched
before the bomb went off.

32:45.853 --> 32:48.029
That kind of overkill means they
were either sending a message...

32:48.053 --> 32:50.463
or there was something there
they didn't want us to find.

32:51.629 --> 32:53.380
We may have beat them to it.

32:56.517 --> 32:59.232
Oh... come on, down in front, man.

32:59.256 --> 33:01.062
Do all your people talk to themselves?

33:01.086 --> 33:02.166
Don't yours?

33:02.190 --> 33:06.218
Have you any idea how many ring dings are sold
each day in your average convenience store?

33:06.242 --> 33:08.807
- Abs, the customers.
- The customers.

33:08.831 --> 33:13.186
They're talking about everything
from the weather to hemorrhoids cream.

33:13.210 --> 33:16.362
There's no audio. How do you
know what they're talking about?

33:18.581 --> 33:20.473
Ah, you read lips.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.028
Maybe she'll surprise you...

33:23.052 --> 33:26.219
okay, you guys want to keep talking
about me or get back to the case?

33:26.243 --> 33:31.047
Um, after watching seven hours of the
most boring reality show ever made,

33:31.071 --> 33:33.868
I've narrowed it down
to one final contestant.

33:34.015 --> 33:36.127
He refers to himself as Abraham.

33:36.151 --> 33:38.017
He didn't say the name
of the golf course,

33:38.041 --> 33:41.630
but he did say that the day
of judgment was approaching.

33:42.377 --> 33:45.653
According to Maryland DMV records,
his full name is Abraham Moussalah.

33:45.677 --> 33:50.588
Born in 1974, served three years for
robbing a convenience store in Baltimore.

33:50.612 --> 33:53.712
Almost got away with
$86 and some ding dongs.

33:53.736 --> 33:55.801
Spent some time in a psych ward,

33:55.825 --> 33:57.872
converted to a radical sect of Islam.

33:57.896 --> 33:59.469
Got a last known for him?

33:59.493 --> 34:02.279
His probation officer hasn't
heard from him in over a year.

34:02.303 --> 34:04.992
No credit cards, no car registrations.

34:05.016 --> 34:06.448
Boss, this guy's gone off the grid

34:06.472 --> 34:08.579
I'll check the bolo.
See if there's any hits.

34:08.603 --> 34:11.978
CID should have intel on Abraham's
sect. I'll make a few calls.

34:12.002 --> 34:15.237
I'm going to coordinate with local
LEOs and highway patrol. Where's Tony?

34:15.261 --> 34:17.000
Don't worry about Tony.

34:17.024 --> 34:20.047
Tony is fine.

34:20.949 --> 34:22.418
Yeah. Gibbs.

34:22.744 --> 34:24.420
On my way, Abs.

34:26.963 --> 34:28.105
Ziva.

34:28.748 --> 34:30.389
Tony is...?

34:36.245 --> 34:38.897
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.

34:39.010 --> 34:40.027
Hey.

34:41.167 --> 34:42.764
Looks like you've made up your mind.

34:42.789 --> 34:45.888
Special agent slash mind reader.

34:45.911 --> 34:48.319
Well, when you're good, you're good,

34:48.353 --> 34:51.317
but I wasn't reading your mind.
I was reading your body language.

34:51.341 --> 34:54.670
You're relaxed. The struggle is
over. You've made up your mind.

34:54.694 --> 34:57.562
Special agent slash dr. Phil.

34:58.900 --> 35:01.063
So what's it gonna be, Josh?

35:01.087 --> 35:04.123
6:00 A.M. Wake-ups and desert camo?

35:04.147 --> 35:09.724
Or all-night frat parties
and jell-o shots with co-eds?

35:10.165 --> 35:12.983
I decided to do what my
dad always wanted me to.

35:13.007 --> 35:16.809
Ah. I'm guessing he wasn't
a big fan of jell-o shots.

35:16.833 --> 35:17.983
No.

35:19.673 --> 35:21.745
But he was a big fan of Princeton.

35:23.093 --> 35:24.631
So you're going back to school.

35:24.655 --> 35:27.472
Then Georgetown law, then
into Naval Intelligence.

35:30.193 --> 35:33.136
That's good. I could use the help.

35:36.393 --> 35:38.849
Listen, I keep my word, Josh.

35:38.873 --> 35:41.169
We're gonna find the
person who did this.

35:42.181 --> 35:43.583
I know, Tony.

35:46.412 --> 35:48.165
It's in your body language.

35:54.087 --> 35:55.989
Remember the cell phone
that was never used?

35:56.013 --> 35:59.186
Well, it was used. Only all
the data was hard-erased.

35:59.210 --> 36:00.393
Hard-erased?

36:00.417 --> 36:03.059
What part of "hard-erased"
do you not understand?

36:03.083 --> 36:04.052
All of it.

36:04.076 --> 36:06.249
Well, then, you've
come to the right place.

36:06.284 --> 36:08.692
A cell phone is very
much like a computer.

36:08.716 --> 36:11.432
You can delete data off of it, but
then if someone knows where to look...

36:11.456 --> 36:12.893
Bottom line, Abby.

36:12.917 --> 36:14.140
The cell phone was used once.

36:14.164 --> 36:16.919
It was an incoming call,
probably to test the detonator.

36:16.943 --> 36:18.664
Then it was reset to factory defaults.

36:18.688 --> 36:20.030
You got a number?

36:20.143 --> 36:22.160
I thought you'd never ask.

36:26.367 --> 36:29.703
The incoming call came from the
warehouse Sharif gave the CIA.

36:29.727 --> 36:31.445
Must be where Abraham
was testing the detonator.

36:31.469 --> 36:32.761
He's not there now.

36:32.785 --> 36:35.089
Place has been crawling
with EOD since yesterday.

36:35.113 --> 36:36.159
Can you trace that call?

36:36.183 --> 36:37.891
If it's on. Ziva.

36:38.082 --> 36:38.879
Almost done.

36:38.903 --> 36:44.598
I'm having Ziva scan the cell tower control-track
frequencies looking for the cell's registration request.

36:45.097 --> 36:46.215
McGee, it just powered up.

36:46.239 --> 36:48.686
Tell me he's not making a call.

36:50.470 --> 36:51.881
Nope, not yet.

36:53.265 --> 36:55.946
I've got his location.
M street and Wisconsin.

36:55.970 --> 36:57.946
Georgetown promenade.

37:01.297 --> 37:03.462
You guys weren't planning on
starting without me, were you?

37:03.486 --> 37:04.267
Who's that?

37:04.291 --> 37:06.882
- Flanking positions on the promenade, east and west.
- Yes, ma'am.

37:06.906 --> 37:08.621
- Clear the civilians quietly.
- We're on it.

37:08.645 --> 37:09.838
DiNozzo.

37:10.054 --> 37:11.465
Princeton.

37:12.423 --> 37:15.372
There. Abraham on the bench.

37:15.963 --> 37:18.411
If he sees us clear the
promenade, he may detonate.

37:18.435 --> 37:21.000
If it's a trip-wire any of
these people may detonate it.

37:21.024 --> 37:23.095
On the second bomb,
he used a cell phone.

37:23.119 --> 37:25.242
The cell phone's not
connected to the backpack.

37:25.266 --> 37:28.184
Trip wire, cell phone who
knows how he armed this one?

37:28.208 --> 37:31.112
A dead-man switch. Or not.

37:31.136 --> 37:33.497
DiNozzo, you keep your ears on me.

37:37.704 --> 37:39.585
What the hell is he doing?

37:39.774 --> 37:41.415
What he always does.

37:42.853 --> 37:44.402
Hey! My hat!

37:44.426 --> 37:48.030
Four marriages... negotiating's
probably not his thing.

37:48.054 --> 37:49.652
You'd be surprised.

37:49.676 --> 37:51.831
Well, I have been so far.

38:02.108 --> 38:03.946
Cell's not the detonator.

38:09.723 --> 38:12.303
My son, Tony, he plays that same game.

38:13.174 --> 38:14.588
What's your name?

38:14.612 --> 38:16.399
Abraham.

38:16.658 --> 38:19.134
Hey, Abraham. Jethro.

38:19.727 --> 38:21.548
Jethro?

38:22.943 --> 38:24.216
That's the name they gave me.

38:24.240 --> 38:27.089
Everybody, please stay calm. Stay back.

38:30.563 --> 38:32.408
That means "friend of god."

38:32.432 --> 38:34.872
The father-in-law of Moses.

38:34.896 --> 38:38.913
He walked with the israelites
when God parted the red sea.

38:41.553 --> 38:45.027
- You know why God parted the red sea?
- No.

38:45.423 --> 38:50.957
To show the people that sea creatures
were totally dependent on God's will.

38:50.981 --> 38:52.345
What is he talking about?

38:52.369 --> 38:54.871
I'd say this guy's a few
puppies short of a pet shop.

38:54.895 --> 38:57.090
Most suicide bombers are.

38:58.643 --> 39:00.690
Abraham, can I ask you a question?

39:03.196 --> 39:07.476
You think it's all right for
someone to hurt innocent people?

39:07.500 --> 39:08.824
No, Jethro.

39:08.848 --> 39:10.524
I didn't think so.

39:12.601 --> 39:14.996
What are you doing here, Abraham?

39:15.020 --> 39:16.987
I'm waiting for my friend.

39:17.177 --> 39:19.364
He's gonna take me to dinner.

39:23.058 --> 39:24.378
Your friend give you the backpack?

39:24.402 --> 39:26.257
Mm-hmm. About an hour ago.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.275
He said so I don't lose it.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.086
What's this friend's name?

39:30.602 --> 39:31.930
Sharif.

39:31.954 --> 39:34.023
So who's laying in autopsy then?

39:34.047 --> 39:36.407
He was supposed to meet me here at 3:00.

39:36.431 --> 39:37.610
Ziva!

39:39.333 --> 39:40.565
Right behind you!

39:40.589 --> 39:44.007
Abraham, is it all right if we
take a look in your backpack?

39:48.013 --> 39:49.337
EOD's still on their way, boss.

39:49.361 --> 39:50.801
We're out of time.

39:50.825 --> 39:53.220
You want me to defuse it? Because
before you said you'd kick my ass...

39:53.244 --> 39:55.424
do it! The rest of you, go!

39:55.448 --> 39:57.389
Go on, get out of here.

40:02.773 --> 40:03.823
30 seconds.

40:03.847 --> 40:04.910
Tony, army knife.

40:04.934 --> 40:06.456
What's your name?

40:07.463 --> 40:11.059
Tim. It means "he who's
about to wet his pants."

40:37.443 --> 40:40.477
Why is he gonna wet his pants?

40:45.940 --> 40:47.385
He's here.

40:51.673 --> 40:53.116
No.

40:54.693 --> 40:56.255
Not anymore.
