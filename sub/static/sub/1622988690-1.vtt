Maybe.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.208
Maybe.

05:06.583 --> 05:07.291
Good morning.

05:09.166 --> 05:10.041
Hey.

05:17.458 --> 05:19.208
Hey darling, how
did you sleep?

05:19.250 --> 05:21.416
Yeah, good, thanks. The
bed is really comfortable.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.291
Good. You got the best room.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.916
- Really?
- No, not really.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.500
- Do you want a coffee?
- Yes, please.

05:26.541 --> 05:29.250
Don't worry, I'll do it.
You get to know the guys.

05:29.291 --> 05:30.333

Arthur.

Arthur!

06:13.208 --> 06:15.166
What?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.041
Oh let me guess.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.416
- Yeah, exactly.
- It's Hugh!

06:18.458 --> 06:20.541
Hugh, what is this doing
in the recycling bin?

06:21.458 --> 06:22.916
Hugh.

06:22.958 --> 06:23.708
What?

06:24.625 --> 06:26.166

Hey, Sheila, show me
who is at the door.

06:39.458 --> 06:40.708
[Sheila] You have a guest.

06:41.750 --> 06:42.791
Is that live?

06:42.833 --> 06:44.291
Oh, yes.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.916
Hey Sheila, open the door.

06:46.958 --> 06:49.166
[Hugh] Hey, Mike, it should
be open. Give it a push.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.333
[Sheila] My name is not Mike.

06:51.375 --> 06:53.375
My name is Sheila.

06:53.416 --> 06:55.250
[Hugh] I said, hey, Sheila.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.375
Why does it always have
to be a female name?

06:57.416 --> 06:58.416
Shush.

06:58.458 --> 06:59.875
[Sheila] Don't tell me to shush.

07:01.041 --> 07:02.333
Way to go Sheila.

[Doorbell sound]

07:04.375 --> 07:06.250

She needs to learn.

07:08.541 --> 07:11.250
Sheila, open the door.

07:11.291 --> 07:12.250
Don't do it, Sheila.

07:12.291 --> 07:13.666
Hugh can do it himself.

07:13.708 --> 07:16.333
[Sheila] Sheila.
My name is Sheila.

07:17.208 --> 07:20.083
Sheila, open the fucking door.

07:20.125 --> 07:21.791
[Sheila] Did you
say "fuck the door"?

07:22.833 --> 07:25.250
[Arthur] No Sheila,
hold the door.

07:25.291 --> 07:27.208
[Sheila] Did you say "hold
door"? [Doorbell sound]

07:27.250 --> 07:28.291
[Sheila] The weather
tomorrow will be...

07:28.333 --> 07:29.541
I'll get it.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.416
- [Arthur] Hold door!
- [Sheila] Hold door!

Please.

07:35.791 --> 07:37.000
[Sheila] A fridge.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.583
You just ordered
a fridge. Hold door.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.625

- [Sheila] My name is Holdor.

What's up?

07:58.625 --> 07:59.750
Harry.

08:01.166 --> 08:02.375
Yeah, I know Harry.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.416
It says he was
killed yesterday.

08:07.041 --> 08:08.083
Killed?

08:10.333 --> 08:11.791
Like in a car crash?

08:11.833 --> 08:13.625
No, it says he's
been murdered.

08:14.666 --> 08:16.125
What?

08:16.166 --> 08:17.083
Yeah.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.375
God, that's terrible.

08:32.583 --> 08:33.541
You're ready?

08:36.041 --> 08:37.666
- Are you ready?
- [Mike] Yes.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.458
Action.

08:45.416 --> 08:46.250
No. Cut cut cut.

08:46.291 --> 08:48.333
Sorry dude, I messed up again.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.791
Back to your position.
Back to your position.

08:50.833 --> 08:52.458
[Muffled] It was my best work.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.625
What?

08:53.666 --> 08:55.708
[Muffled] This is
so undignified.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.333
- What went wrong this time?
- You're out of focus.

08:58.375 --> 09:01.541
Oh, and that's my fault
is it? Not yours?

09:01.583 --> 09:04.666
It's contrast based. It gets
confused by the colours.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.958
Anyway, back to your position.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.750
But why?

09:08.791 --> 09:10.208
Because we need to start again.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.250
But why all the...

09:14.166 --> 09:16.375
Why am I... like this?

09:16.416 --> 09:19.208
I've told you before, I'm
going to green screen you.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.291
But what for?

09:23.333 --> 09:26.375
It's a Hollywood technique,
it will make you disappear.

09:26.416 --> 09:28.791
Oh, you didn't say anything
about making me disappear.

09:29.708 --> 09:33.500
You will disappear, but the
skates can still be seen.

09:33.541 --> 09:34.583
So it's like...

09:34.625 --> 09:37.708
Like I'm the invisible
man, on skates.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.333
Listen, listen.
The hierarchy is...

09:40.375 --> 09:41.791
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.750
Director, actor,
director, actor.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.458
I'm director. You're actor.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.333
Okay? it doesn't matter.

09:47.375 --> 09:49.791
How exactly is that supposed
to help me get work as an actor?

09:49.833 --> 09:53.500
Who the hell is going to want
to see me covered like this?

09:53.541 --> 09:55.041
It's not how Hollywood works.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.833
Oh really, tell me how
Hollywood works, Hugh.

09:56.875 --> 09:59.500
There's a difference
between being famous and

09:59.541 --> 10:00.791
being a celebrity.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.125
- Really?
- Look at the guy who plays

10:04.041 --> 10:05.416
Chewbacca.

10:05.458 --> 10:07.916
He's super famous
but not a celebrity.

10:07.958 --> 10:09.458
Mr Blobby!

10:09.500 --> 10:10.791
- Mr Blobby?
- Mr Blobby.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.750
He's super famous,
but not a celebrity.

10:14.416 --> 10:16.208
Well, he is a celebrity
because everyone knows who

10:16.250 --> 10:18.000
- Mr Blobby is, Hugh.
- Who is he?

10:18.041 --> 10:20.208
I don't fucking know
who he actually is.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.500
I don't know the actor.
I've never met him.

10:22.541 --> 10:25.125
I just know him as Mr Blobby.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.416
You know Mr Blobby though.
That's proven my point.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.458
Of course I know Mr Blobby,
I don't know who the guy is

10:29.500 --> 10:31.500
inside the suit, it might be
more than one person.

10:32.625 --> 10:34.708
Back to your position.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.500
- To my position?
- Yes, to your position.

10:37.541 --> 10:39.833
- Back to your position.
- Okay okay!

10:43.708 --> 10:45.708
Okay. Camera rolling.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.791
And action.

10:50.458 --> 10:52.625
Action! Mike!

10:52.666 --> 10:55.041
This is so unprofessional.

11:02.916 --> 11:05.583
Well, I'm on Fulham Road
right now, so I'll take the

11:05.625 --> 11:07.208
short cut through the
cemetery. I'll be

11:07.250 --> 11:08.666
there in three minutes, okay?

13:18.208 --> 13:19.958
You're okay?

13:20.000 --> 13:23.041
- Come on, it was just a prank.
- A prank?

13:23.083 --> 13:25.291
- Yes.
- Your friend fucking scared me!

13:27.666 --> 13:29.333
What are you talking about?

[Leo] Hey, Soph, it's Leo.

13:50.750 --> 13:53.041
I hope you're settling okay
with your new flatmates.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.458
[Car honks]

13:54.500 --> 13:57.041
It feels really
empty here without you.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.458
Give me a call when
you've got some time.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.666
I miss you.

What?

14:41.916 --> 14:43.000
Tell me.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.083
He died on the way
to the hospital.

14:53.583 --> 14:56.750
I need to hang up now.
I'll see you at home.

14:56.791 --> 14:58.750
Yeah.

14:58.791 --> 15:00.041
[Phone tone]

15:01.750 --> 15:02.833

Can you play it again?

[Audio from computer]
You're ready?

15:13.083 --> 15:16.416
- [Hugh] Are you ready?
- [Mike] Yes!

15:16.458 --> 15:18.333
- [Hugh] Action.

15:19.500 --> 15:23.333
[Hugh] Wait, no. Cut cut cut.
Sorry dude, I messed up.

15:23.375 --> 15:26.833
- [Hugh] Back to your position.
- [Mike] Alright.

15:28.708 --> 15:31.000
What were you trying
to achieve exactly?

15:32.208 --> 15:33.625
It's just a...

15:38.166 --> 15:39.833
Nothing.

15:45.125 --> 15:47.041
Play the stabbing part again.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.500
[Audio from the laptop]

This is so unprofessional.

15:51.791 --> 15:53.500
[Sound of struggle]

15:53.541 --> 15:55.416
We don't even see the back
of his head with the hood.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.208
Was your friend involved
in gangs or any sort of

16:01.250 --> 16:02.708
criminal activity?

16:02.750 --> 16:04.375
I told you before. No.

16:04.416 --> 16:07.416
What about drugs?
Using? Selling?

16:07.458 --> 16:09.208
No.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.375
Play the videos again.

16:11.416 --> 16:13.625
- The last one?
- All of them.

- [Hugh] Action

16:16.708 --> 16:20.083
Oh, okay. Cut cut cut.
Back to your position.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.791
- Next.
- [Mike] Hope you get polio.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.541
Next.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.875
- [Hugh] Mr Blobby?
- [Mike] Mr Blobby. He's super

16:25.916 --> 16:27.875
- famous but not a celebrity
- Out of focus. Next.

16:27.916 --> 16:29.708
[Hugh] Go fuck yourself.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.875
- Next. Next.
- [Hugh] You know nothing.

16:31.916 --> 16:36.208
- [Hugh] Big green piece of...
- Next. Out of focus, again.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.333
- [Hugh] We're here to work.
- Not this one, too blurry.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.375
- Next.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.833
[Hugh] Get back to
your position.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.791
Next. Useless. Next.

16:44.833 --> 16:46.833
[Mike] I don't fucking know who
the man is inside the suit.

16:46.875 --> 16:47.875
Stop!

16:48.875 --> 16:50.166
Look.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.250
- Over there.
- [Hugh] Back to your position.

[Multiple mouse clicks]

17:05.541 --> 17:07.583
[Mystery music]

17:10.458 --> 17:12.375
That's him.

17:12.416 --> 17:13.666
Are you sure?

17:14.708 --> 17:16.208
I'm positive.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.041
Do they think it is the
same guy that killed Harry?

17:18.083 --> 17:20.250
To them is two separate
cases for the moment.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.250
Hello.

17:25.625 --> 17:27.500
Did you all have a good day?

17:27.541 --> 17:28.958
Why is it so blurry?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.833
I thought your phone was
going to be 8K or something.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.250
[Phone rings]

17:32.291 --> 17:36.041
Yeah look, I'll call you
back in a bit alright?

17:36.083 --> 17:37.750
So what are they gonna do?

17:37.791 --> 17:39.208
I don't think
they'll do anything.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.750
They're just waiting for
him to make a mistake.

17:40.791 --> 17:42.333
Like what?

17:42.375 --> 17:45.708
They say criminals often can't
resist boasting on social media.

You don't know.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.291
Hugh's friend was killed
in front of him.

17:59.750 --> 18:00.916
What, Mike?

18:04.208 --> 18:05.208
Yeah.

18:07.416 --> 18:08.833
I'm going to warn others.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.625
I'm going to put a post on
the London skaters forum.

18:11.666 --> 18:13.666
Good idea. We should
probably talk to some

18:13.708 --> 18:15.375

my calls? Please just call...

20:18.166 --> 20:19.583
Did you get some
sleep last night?

20:21.458 --> 20:22.291
Yeah.

20:25.041 --> 20:26.083
No.

20:30.333 --> 20:31.333
Hugh.

20:32.291 --> 20:34.125
It's not your fault.

20:35.333 --> 20:36.833
It's not your fault.

20:40.166 --> 20:41.250
"It's not your fault".

20:43.083 --> 20:44.666
"Look at me son".

20:44.708 --> 20:48.375
"It's not your fault.
It's not your fault, Will".

20:59.708 --> 21:01.125

21:05.333 --> 21:07.875
- It's not your fault, really.
- I get it. Thank you Kat.

21:11.708 --> 21:12.958
It's also not your fault.

21:14.250 --> 21:15.916
What, that Mike died?

21:15.958 --> 21:17.458
No, Harry!

21:20.000 --> 21:22.583
Oh, yeah, of course.

21:25.833 --> 21:27.208
What do you mean "of course"?

21:31.541 --> 21:33.958
Obviously, it's not my
fault that Harry died.

21:35.291 --> 21:38.583
I know, and obviously it's not
my fault that Mike died.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.833
Of course.

21:46.333 --> 21:47.291
"Of course".

21:53.416 --> 21:54.208
But

21:55.791 --> 21:59.291
if I hadn't told him to meet me
at that specific place at that

21:59.333 --> 22:01.916
specific time, then
he'd still be alive.

22:03.500 --> 22:08.083
So it's not my fault he died,
but it still is a little bit,

22:08.125 --> 22:08.916
right?

22:09.875 --> 22:11.000
Yeah.

22:12.166 --> 22:14.125
You're a terrible friend.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.916
No, no, Hugh.

22:16.958 --> 22:17.958
Come on.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.458
Show me something
on your phone.

22:24.791 --> 22:26.583
My phone?

22:26.625 --> 22:28.541
Yeah, you're
always like

22:28.583 --> 22:31.416
"Hey Kat, I can tell you

22:32.333 --> 22:34.375
how many planes
there are in the sky

22:34.416 --> 22:36.125
in Australia" or

22:37.291 --> 22:40.750
"Hey, Kat, if I was an
old lady, I'd look like this."

22:42.291 --> 22:44.291
Are you taking the piss?

22:44.333 --> 22:47.666
No! Okay, those are
terrible examples, but

22:47.708 --> 22:50.041
it's interesting, sometimes.

22:54.375 --> 22:55.333
Please.

22:58.041 --> 22:58.833
Okay.

23:02.916 --> 23:07.458
Oh, it's the view from
our doorbell camera.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.833
Uh uh, look closer.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.791
Oh, that's our house!

23:14.833 --> 23:16.125
Yes.

23:17.041 --> 23:19.291
Viewed from the house
across the street.

23:19.333 --> 23:20.666
Yes.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.291
Did you hack our neighbours'
doorbell camera?

23:24.333 --> 23:27.791
It is not hacking if
your password is 1234.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.333
Oh my God, Hugh!

23:31.375 --> 23:33.333
Come on, it's not
private, it's the street.

23:33.375 --> 23:35.416
Now we can see our house
from a different angle.

23:35.458 --> 23:36.666
More security.

I wonder if I
can upscale this...

Is that Leo?

Oh, yeah.

23:43.125 --> 23:45.083
Do you still talk to him?

23:45.125 --> 23:47.083
He calls me sometimes.

23:47.125 --> 23:50.250
He's trying to get inside
information on Sophie.

23:50.291 --> 23:54.250
Jesus, is he still
not over their break up?

23:54.291 --> 23:56.416
Nope. Total denial.

24:00.541 --> 24:01.958
Hey Sophie.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.500
It's Arthur actually, I'm
using Sophie's phone because

24:03.541 --> 24:05.041
she's using mine.
Where are you?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.375
With Hugh, at the skatepark.

24:08.416 --> 24:09.875
Oh shit.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.333
Do you know anyone who is in
the Moorgate area right now?

24:12.375 --> 24:15.250
Oh, we saw Angela earlier,
she said she was heading that

24:15.291 --> 24:16.416
way to meet Tony. Do you want...

24:16.458 --> 24:17.416
Okay thanks bye.

24:21.458 --> 24:22.791
What's going on?

24:22.833 --> 24:24.250
I have no idea.

24:31.625 --> 24:32.791
Hi Soph.

24:32.833 --> 24:34.291
It's Arthur actually,
no time to explain.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.291
Where are you guys?

24:35.333 --> 24:37.791
Close to Old Street, why?

24:37.833 --> 24:40.375
Okay, Kat told you about
the killer, right?

24:40.416 --> 24:42.541
Well, someone spotted
him and called me.

24:42.583 --> 24:44.166
What? Who called?

24:45.083 --> 24:46.416
A girl called
Cristina, but anyway

24:46.458 --> 24:48.333
Why don't you
call the police?

24:48.375 --> 24:50.666
Yeah, yeah no, I will.
But they might be too slow.

24:50.708 --> 24:52.791
So we need skaters and Kat told
me that you and Tony might be

24:52.833 --> 24:54.041
in the area.

24:54.708 --> 24:55.916
But where are they?

24:57.041 --> 24:58.500
Where are they?

24:58.541 --> 25:01.125

25:01.166 --> 25:02.875

25:06.375 --> 25:07.875
going towards Brick Lane.

25:07.916 --> 25:09.250
- Close to Liverpool
Street, go there.
- Anything else?

25:09.291 --> 25:11.375
[Angela] Okay, but you call
the cops too, right?

25:11.416 --> 25:13.458
Yeah yeah, let me get off
the phone and do it, okay?

25:18.833 --> 25:20.750
[999 Operator] 999,
what's your emergency?

25:20.791 --> 25:22.416
Hi yeah, okay, we spotted the

25:22.458 --> 25:24.000
killer, you know the one who's
been killing the skaters?

25:24.041 --> 25:25.958
Right, so he's near Liverpool
Street Station so we need you

25:26.000 --> 25:27.958
to send a police car there
straightaway, because this guy

25:28.000 --> 25:29.458
[999 Operator] Sir,
I need you to slow down.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.458
- What's your emergency?
- Are you still moving?

25:31.500 --> 25:33.291
We spotted the killer.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.958
[999 Operator] Who
did you spot, sir?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.291
Well, not me personally,
but Cristina,

25:37.333 --> 25:40.875
she spotted him, and she called
me on my phone, because I put a

25:40.916 --> 25:43.333
post on social media,
with my phone number.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.708
So she called me on my phone.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.416
I've given my phone
to Sophie and...

25:46.458 --> 25:47.916
[999 Operator] Sir, this is
really difficult to follow,

25:47.958 --> 25:49.416
Who called who and why?

25:49.458 --> 25:51.333
So I'm calling you on Sophie's
phone because this guy is

25:51.375 --> 25:53.166
dangerous and I don't
want her to get hurt!

25:53.208 --> 25:54.583

understand a single word

you're saying I
need you to calm down.

25:59.416 --> 26:01.208

is taking place?

you for a precise address.

she's saying, what Cristina is

to me, to you.

what's your postcode?

26:21.541 --> 26:24.291

where I live?

is taking place.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.250
[Sophie] Cristina,
don't approach him.

26:33.291 --> 26:35.583
You really need to keep your
distance with this guy,

26:35.625 --> 26:38.416

he's super dangerous.

lot of graffiti.

I can't work with that,

26:54.541 --> 26:56.125

- No they hung up!

- What!
- I know, right?

That was a complete
fucking fiasco.

29:25.458 --> 29:26.958
Tony should never have
chased him alone.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.708
It's not my fault the police
would not send a car

29:28.750 --> 29:30.750
without an address. They kept
asking for a postcode.

29:30.791 --> 29:32.416
I told you street names.

29:32.458 --> 29:33.833
They were asking for postcode.

to provide postcodes?

Felix and Osama caught that guy.

him, he was way too fast.

Oh, maybe you were
not in London yet.

to rob a skate shop and Osama

They managed to catch him.

I remember him very well
from when he killed Mike.

You previously stated that
you hardly saw his face.

31:42.833 --> 31:46.791
Well, yeah, I did.
But it's definitely him!

31:46.833 --> 31:48.958
He almost assaulted one of
our friends in a cemetery

31:49.000 --> 31:51.833
the other day and she
saw him very clearly.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.375
Was it reported?

31:53.416 --> 31:57.375
No, because at the time she
wasn't aware he was dangerous.

didn't get assaulted.

32:03.083 --> 32:05.500
- "Claire".

in the cemetery.

exactly like that.

33:18.833 --> 33:19.791
Interesting.

33:21.750 --> 33:22.583
What?

33:24.208 --> 33:26.625
He was released last month.

33:26.666 --> 33:29.375
See? It's got to be him!

33:29.416 --> 33:31.250
But, why would he do that?

33:33.708 --> 33:34.666
Revenge.

33:35.666 --> 33:37.416
What do you mean?

33:37.458 --> 33:41.958
Well, if you're thinking
about it, this guy spent six

33:42.000 --> 33:45.458
years of his life behind bars
because he was caught by a

33:45.500 --> 33:50.166
couple of skaters, and
now he wants revenge.

33:50.208 --> 33:52.166
The guys who caught him...

33:52.208 --> 33:53.125
Omar.

33:54.458 --> 33:57.125
Osama and Felix, they're
not in London anymore.

33:59.250 --> 34:02.625
So he's probably just going
after random skaters.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.833
Look it's an interesting theory.

34:05.875 --> 34:07.083
And we'll look into it.

34:08.250 --> 34:10.041
But it's not us you
have to convince.

34:10.083 --> 34:12.291
It's the judiciary system.

34:12.333 --> 34:17.250
Let me tell you. Nobody goes to
prison on vague assumptions,

34:17.291 --> 34:20.333
vague memories or
blurry videos.

34:22.833 --> 34:24.708
So what else do we need?

34:24.750 --> 34:29.375
Perhaps the murder weapon
with victim's DNA on it.

34:29.416 --> 34:31.208
You said he was using
a switchblade knife,

34:31.250 --> 34:32.791
and they're harder to clean.

34:32.833 --> 34:36.083
So we could be lucky and
find some DNA traces there.

34:37.250 --> 34:39.250
Okay, what do we do?

34:40.916 --> 34:44.000
"We"? There is no "we".

34:44.041 --> 34:47.833
You both go home and try to
avoid skating on your own.

34:47.875 --> 34:50.875
Or avoid skating
altogether if I'm honest.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.916
But he's going
to hurt our friends!

34:56.416 --> 34:58.916
Look, sooner or later,
we'll catch him.

34:58.958 --> 35:01.333
But I have to admit that
it won't be an easy one

35:01.375 --> 35:02.791
because he moves so fast.

35:03.916 --> 35:05.291
But he'll make a mistake.

35:07.333 --> 35:09.000
Is that all?

35:09.041 --> 35:10.875
For today, yes.

35:10.916 --> 35:12.500
You need to do more.

35:12.541 --> 35:16.041
It's just, you don't
really care, do you?

35:16.083 --> 35:17.083
Do not say that.

35:18.625 --> 35:22.416
There are 150 people killed by
knife in London every year.

35:22.458 --> 35:25.250
And most of the victims are
poor and they're young

35:25.291 --> 35:28.500
and they're black, and
nobody cares, but we do.

35:28.541 --> 35:33.333
And we do care, but we do what
we can with what we have.

35:33.375 --> 35:34.958
Do you understand?

35:42.791 --> 35:45.000
[phone rings]
Oh, uh,

35:47.583 --> 35:48.791
Uh, uh.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.041
It's Kat.

35:53.916 --> 35:55.666
How did it go?

35:55.708 --> 35:58.041
Not good, but we're
on the right track,

35:58.083 --> 36:00.125
this guy left jail
about a month ago.

36:00.166 --> 36:02.666
Okay, so what are they
going to do about it?

36:02.708 --> 36:04.125
Nothing.

36:04.166 --> 36:07.458
These guys are just
overwhelmed with cases.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.541
We'll have to figure this
one out on our own.

36:09.583 --> 36:13.375
Hey, I want to run a quick test.
Is my computer still on?

36:13.416 --> 36:16.500
- Yeah.
- Okay, my password is

36:18.291 --> 36:22.041
A.R.T.H.U.R.I.S.A.D.I.C.K.

36:26.541 --> 36:28.625
"Arthur is a dick".

36:28.666 --> 36:32.875
It's no, it's an
anagram for some...

36:32.916 --> 36:36.541
Never mind, enter your phone
number and click "locate",

36:36.583 --> 36:37.750
then "house".

36:42.458 --> 36:44.000
You should receive
notification on your

36:44.041 --> 36:45.208
phone click "accept".

36:51.291 --> 36:53.250
Okay, a little icon comes
up where our house is.

36:54.583 --> 36:56.625
Great, draw a rectangle
around it and then

36:56.666 --> 36:58.083
click on the cameras.

37:08.125 --> 37:11.708
Hmm, Okay, I can see the video
feed from our doorbell camera.

37:12.958 --> 37:15.041
Hang on, this is our
neighbours' camera?

37:15.083 --> 37:16.916
Did you hack our
neighbours' camera?

37:18.333 --> 37:21.416
It's not hacking if
your password is 1234.

37:21.458 --> 37:23.208
Precisely.

37:23.250 --> 37:25.250
Actually, it's not
exactly 123...

37:26.000 --> 37:27.416
Never mind.

37:27.458 --> 37:32.416
Now enter my phone number
087 8786 5436.

37:32.458 --> 37:36.833
Then click "locate", draw
a rectangle around and

37:36.875 --> 37:38.583
click on the cameras.

37:40.875 --> 37:42.083
[Sophie] Give us a wave.

37:46.958 --> 37:49.458
Cool, but that would only work
if we have the killer's

37:49.500 --> 37:50.875
phone number, right?

37:51.833 --> 37:55.083
Yeah, and that's the thing.
I need to do more work.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.416
Oh, my god.

37:56.458 --> 37:58.208
What?

37:58.250 --> 38:00.458
Another victim, Amanda.

38:02.291 --> 38:03.791
Is she dead?

38:03.833 --> 38:06.125
No, seriously wounded though.

38:07.083 --> 38:10.875
- We've got to catch this guy.
- We need to catch him now.

38:10.916 --> 38:13.250
We need skaters, fast ones.

38:16.750 --> 38:19.916
[Leo on voicemail]
Sophie, we need to talk.
Please just call me.

40:06.458 --> 40:08.708
- Hey Kat.
- Hey Leo.

40:08.750 --> 40:12.500
So did you talk
to Sophie about me?

40:13.375 --> 40:17.916
She is my housemate, so
I talk to her every day.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.625
But did you talk
to her about me?

40:21.458 --> 40:27.041
To be honest, Sophie, she's not
that forthcoming when it comes

40:27.083 --> 40:28.833
to talking about
you guys, I'm sorry.

40:31.041 --> 40:32.041
Why not?

40:34.208 --> 40:39.250
Leo, sometimes you need
to try and read into the

40:39.291 --> 40:40.708
silence a bit.

40:42.791 --> 40:47.375
Look, I'm a guy. I use words
to communicate, not cryptic

40:47.416 --> 40:49.583
language or ambiguous signs.

40:50.458 --> 40:52.916
"Silence" is, in fact, a word.

40:54.416 --> 40:56.250
"Over" it's another word.

40:56.291 --> 41:00.791
I know you're familiar with that
one. "Distance", a word.

41:00.833 --> 41:05.208
Oh "break up", that's a word.
Technically that's two words.

41:05.250 --> 41:07.250
Those are your words,
I want Sophie's words.

41:07.291 --> 41:09.833
Oh, my God, but
you're asking me!

41:10.916 --> 41:14.541
Leo, I'm not trying
to upset you.

41:14.583 --> 41:17.875
I just don't want to
see you get hurt again.

41:17.916 --> 41:20.291
Did you just come
here to tell me that?

41:20.333 --> 41:21.791
No.

41:21.833 --> 41:24.750
You heard about the
skaters who got attacked?

41:24.791 --> 41:26.000
I've heard the rumours.

41:27.583 --> 41:30.166
We're putting together a team
and we're gonna catch the guy.

41:30.208 --> 41:33.291
The thing is, he's super fast.
So um...

41:34.333 --> 41:36.500
So we need people like you.

41:39.916 --> 41:42.916
So why do you need me? Why
can't you get him yourself?

41:42.958 --> 41:46.333
Leo come on, I'm a dancer.
I'm not a racer.

41:46.375 --> 41:49.375
Arthur's not fast
enough, Hugh

41:49.416 --> 41:50.708
is not fast enough.

41:52.458 --> 41:55.125
Listen, I haven't got
time right now for this.

41:55.166 --> 41:57.708
Maybe Luis can help
you out, but I'm sorry.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.208
Yeah.

42:02.250 --> 42:03.875
Let me know if you
change your mind.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.083
- Wow.
- Very nice.

42:15.125 --> 42:16.541
Awesome.

42:16.583 --> 42:20.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Virtual Eagle One.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.791
That's cool. I
like it, snazzy.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.291
I think it's a really
good name, personally.

42:28.333 --> 42:29.541
Good choice Hugh.

42:29.583 --> 42:32.375
Eagles are spectacular birds.

42:34.416 --> 42:35.750
Hey, Roberto.

42:35.791 --> 42:37.833
Oh "Roberto"!

42:37.875 --> 42:40.125
What happened to Sheila,
did she get the boot?

42:41.083 --> 42:43.375
Roberto, set the lights
to Primrose Morning.

42:43.416 --> 42:46.000
[Female voice]
[Roberto] My name is Roberto.

42:46.041 --> 42:47.458
Really?

42:47.500 --> 42:49.458
[Roberto] Did you say
"tomorrow morning"?

42:49.500 --> 42:52.541
No Roberto I said
"Primrose Morning".

42:52.583 --> 42:54.375
[Roberto] Antarctica Glory.

42:55.333 --> 42:59.083
That's Antarctica Glory,
Roberto, I said...

42:59.125 --> 43:01.875
[Roberto] Did you say
"Antarctica Glory"?

43:02.958 --> 43:04.541
No, I didn't say "Antarctica"

43:04.583 --> 43:08.208
[Roberto] Antarctica Glory. You
just said "Antarctica Glory".

43:08.250 --> 43:10.125
You did just say
"Antarctica Glory".

43:10.166 --> 43:11.625
[Roberto] My name is Roberta.

43:11.666 --> 43:16.208
- No "Primrose Morning".
- [Roberto] Roberty is my name.

43:16.250 --> 43:17.791
Roberto, I said....

43:17.833 --> 43:22.625
[Roberto] Your fridge will be
delivered Monday at 11 a.m.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.291
Holdor. In the afternoon.

43:25.333 --> 43:28.333
Roberty. Morning.
Holdor. Holdor.

43:28.375 --> 43:29.708
Whatever.

43:30.666 --> 43:35.458
Tell us about your set up, Hugh.
I like the monitor stand

43:35.500 --> 43:38.125
thing, very convenient.

43:38.166 --> 43:40.958
Okay. Each chaser is
going to be geolocalised

43:41.000 --> 43:42.833
with their mobile phone device.

43:42.875 --> 43:45.166
We'll track them using live
maps and give them directions

43:45.208 --> 43:46.625
via a conference call system.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.958
What about the killer?
How are we going to track him?

43:51.000 --> 43:52.958
Hey hey, here's the idea.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.375
It's an ML based target
system using sequential

43:55.416 --> 43:56.916
learning like AB-list.

43:56.958 --> 43:59.250
First, we get a representation
of the input vector and then

43:59.291 --> 44:02.250
extrapolate an activation in
free forward back propagation.

44:06.166 --> 44:07.416
Artificial Intelligence.

44:08.416 --> 44:09.708
Oh.

44:09.750 --> 44:12.125
"A.I.", right, good old A.I.

44:13.458 --> 44:15.500
Let me do a quick demo.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.291
This camera

44:24.708 --> 44:28.291
corresponds to this feed.

44:28.333 --> 44:31.958
See that cyclist?
Let's say she's our target.

44:33.916 --> 44:37.250
The system has now scanned
our target, assigned a unique

44:37.291 --> 44:39.500
identifier to it,
and a localisation.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.166
The system is then able to
track our target and based on

44:54.208 --> 44:56.666
the data gathered, create a
trajectory that corresponds to

44:56.708 --> 44:58.666
our moving target.

44:58.708 --> 45:02.083
Boom. And the area covered
automatically moves

45:02.125 --> 45:02.916
with the target.

45:04.541 --> 45:06.041
Boom.

45:06.083 --> 45:08.791
So what if we had like
two identical cars, right?

45:08.833 --> 45:10.208
Same make, same model.

45:10.250 --> 45:12.500
Would it be able to tell the
difference between them?

45:12.541 --> 45:15.041
We're looking for a skater,
right? Not a car.

45:16.666 --> 45:18.708
Yeah, yeah, I guess, yeah.

45:18.750 --> 45:21.708
Just a few more days and
we'll be ready to go.

45:22.625 --> 45:25.583
We still need time to
find more chasers anyway.

45:25.625 --> 45:28.125
And how do we locate the
killer in the first place?

45:28.166 --> 45:30.625
We can't just wait around and
hope for someone to call us

45:30.666 --> 45:31.666
like last time.

45:33.875 --> 45:37.125
What we could do is patiently
go through every street in

45:37.166 --> 45:40.708
London looking for skaters,
hoping that we eventually

45:40.750 --> 45:42.708
find this guy.

45:42.750 --> 45:45.083
Yeah, but I mean, there's
loads of skaters in London,

45:45.125 --> 45:46.500
look there's one there.

45:46.541 --> 45:47.708
I don't know.

45:49.500 --> 45:50.750
Wait go back.

45:50.791 --> 45:51.958
Where?

45:52.000 --> 45:54.708
Over there, you were on
the left. No before.

45:54.750 --> 45:57.041
Up up, up a bit.

45:59.333 --> 46:01.833
It's just a random skater.

46:01.875 --> 46:04.833
Shit, that looks like him.

46:09.875 --> 46:11.458
Shit, it is him!

46:12.583 --> 46:14.833
What? How can you
guys be so sure?

46:14.875 --> 46:17.666
It's not even his
face, it's his style.

46:17.708 --> 46:20.541
Every skater has a type of
signature, and I remember

46:20.583 --> 46:21.541
his very well.

46:22.500 --> 46:23.708
So what do we do?

46:24.625 --> 46:26.333
We're not ready.

46:26.375 --> 46:27.458
No.

46:29.416 --> 46:32.166
No, but...

46:32.208 --> 46:33.750
All right, here is
what I suggest

46:33.791 --> 46:34.625
Let's do it!

46:41.416 --> 46:42.833
Track him Hugh, track him.

46:47.500 --> 46:50.416
Oh you're still here?

46:50.458 --> 46:53.083
Where's my phone?

46:55.791 --> 46:58.541
I call George, you call
Phil and Sophie.

46:58.583 --> 46:59.791
I'm Sophie.

46:59.833 --> 47:02.291
Sorry, I mean, Phil and Luis.

47:02.333 --> 47:04.333
I'm going to join the other
skaters, what do you think?

47:04.375 --> 47:06.541
No you're too slow, you
call Tony and Angela and

47:06.583 --> 47:07.875
Nigel and Joey.

47:07.916 --> 47:09.166
He's going towards
Saint Paul's, tell everyone

47:09.208 --> 47:10.958
he's going towards Saint Paul's.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.583
Tell each chaser to accept
the notification I'm going

47:12.625 --> 47:14.958
to push to their phone
so I can track them.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.333
Understood? Notification.
Phone. Accept. Simple.

47:23.250 --> 47:27.750
Phone numbers for tracking.
Phone numbers, give them to me.

47:27.791 --> 47:31.458
Start with Angela and Tony,
you already have theirs.

47:31.500 --> 47:33.750
Yes right now, it might
be our only chance.

47:33.791 --> 47:36.625
Guys, I need to
set up a conf call.

47:36.666 --> 47:39.375
Just fucking do it then.

47:39.416 --> 47:41.750
Don't panic. Guys don't panic!

47:41.791 --> 47:44.208
- Stop shouting!
- You're shouting!

47:44.250 --> 47:45.791
- You're shouting!
- You're shouting!

47:45.833 --> 47:47.083
You're all shouting.

47:47.125 --> 47:48.625
Yeah. How far away are
you from Saint Paul's?

47:48.666 --> 47:50.000
You're going to receive a
notification to your phone.

47:50.041 --> 47:51.708
You need to accept it
so we can track you okay?

47:51.750 --> 47:53.208
Keep heading towards
Saint Paul's.

47:53.250 --> 47:55.000
We can end this call now
and we'll call you back

47:55.041 --> 47:56.958
- on a shared line.
- okay got it.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.708
Let's go.

47:58.750 --> 48:01.000
Are you still moving?

48:01.041 --> 48:02.541
Phil, did you receive
the notification?

48:03.500 --> 48:05.833
Okay, I've got it.

48:05.875 --> 48:07.875
Great, head for Saint Paul's,
I'm going to hang up, but we'll

48:07.916 --> 48:10.500
call you back on
a shared line.

48:10.541 --> 48:12.708
George, I'm going to hang
up, and we'll call you back

48:12.750 --> 48:14.041
from a shared line.

48:15.750 --> 48:17.458
Okay, I'm hanging up.

48:21.291 --> 48:23.291
Hello can you hear me?

48:24.208 --> 48:26.458
[George] Guys this is George,
can you hear me?

48:26.500 --> 48:28.833
Yes we can. Who else
do we have on?

48:28.875 --> 48:30.791
Hey, guys, it's Phil here.

48:30.833 --> 48:34.083
[Luis] I can't hear you,
is this the conference call?

48:34.125 --> 48:37.000
Yes, welcome to
Virtual Eagle One.

48:37.041 --> 48:38.916
Come on pick up, pick up.

48:40.125 --> 48:42.166
Who are we missing?

48:42.208 --> 48:44.583
Nigel's in Brighton and I'm
trying to get hold of Jerry,

48:44.625 --> 48:46.208
but he's not picking
up for some reason.

48:47.125 --> 48:49.500
[Relaxing music]

48:49.541 --> 48:51.125
[Phone rings]

48:56.541 --> 48:58.583
[Tony] Hugh, I'm going to
connect my phone to my camera.

48:58.625 --> 48:59.916
What what what?

49:00.875 --> 49:02.708
I'm sending you a video
feed from my camera.

49:05.458 --> 49:07.458
[Tony] You should
receive it by now.

49:07.500 --> 49:08.916
[Hugh] Jesus.

49:08.958 --> 49:10.916
[Tony] I got the camera
on eBay, really cheap.

49:10.958 --> 49:13.375
- [Hugh] No shit?
- [Tony] What did you say?

49:13.416 --> 49:15.791
Nothing Tony it's great,
really lovely footage.

49:15.833 --> 49:17.500
Very helpful. Thank you.

49:19.708 --> 49:20.916
[Tony] Is the image okay?

49:21.625 --> 49:23.000
It's not too shaky, is it?

49:24.166 --> 49:26.750
It's wonderful Tony.

49:26.791 --> 49:28.500
Just focus on getting
there as soon as you can.

49:28.541 --> 49:29.625
Yeah, not too fast.

49:31.250 --> 49:33.708
[Hugh] To all chasers, this is
Virtual Eagle One speaking.

49:33.750 --> 49:35.375
Keep heading towards
Saint Paul's.

49:35.416 --> 49:37.958
Can you all state your name and
confirm that you can hear me?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.333
[All talk, unintelligible]

49:41.625 --> 49:43.166
Thank you.

49:43.208 --> 49:44.916
I'll update you on the target
location as soon as possible.

49:46.333 --> 49:47.583
Who's this guy?

49:48.583 --> 49:51.041
Virtual Eagle One speaking,
who is yellow dot?

49:51.916 --> 49:53.708
Guys, this is Virtual...

49:53.750 --> 49:56.375
Can we just not do that
Virtual whatever Eagle?

49:58.458 --> 50:01.333
Fine. Who is yellow dot?

50:01.375 --> 50:03.541
They don't know their colours.

50:03.583 --> 50:05.000
Who's in Mile End?

50:06.625 --> 50:08.750
- Mile End?
- [Hugh] Yes.

50:08.791 --> 50:11.166
That would be me, Phil.

50:11.208 --> 50:12.750
Why are you going east Phil?

50:12.791 --> 50:14.625
You should be going
west then right.

50:16.083 --> 50:17.958
Oh, like the opposite.

50:19.625 --> 50:20.833
Yeah, the exact opposite.

50:20.875 --> 50:23.500
This guy is going
to arrive first.

50:23.541 --> 50:25.375
Guys, priority number
one is your safety.

50:25.416 --> 50:27.291
No one approaches the
killer on their own.

50:27.333 --> 50:28.583
Do you understand?

50:29.750 --> 50:33.083
Purple dot, who's near Waterloo?

50:33.125 --> 50:35.375
Yes, that's me, why?

50:36.375 --> 50:38.375
Nothing, you're just a bit
further away from the target

50:38.416 --> 50:40.166
- compared to the others.
- Hurry up dude.

50:40.208 --> 50:41.791
- Not too fast.
- Stop saying that!

50:41.833 --> 50:44.791
Luis, go as fast as you
possibly can, okay?

50:44.833 --> 50:46.500
[Phil] Can I confirm I'm
going in the right direction?

50:47.458 --> 50:48.958
[Hugh] You are?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.375
[Phil] Phil, I was in Mile End.

50:51.416 --> 50:52.708
Yellow dot.

50:54.291 --> 50:55.958
Why are you going north now?

50:56.000 --> 50:58.625
She said "turn right",
and that's what I did.

50:59.500 --> 51:01.041
[Phil] You have to give
me clear directions.

51:01.083 --> 51:03.083
I'm not from London.

51:03.125 --> 51:04.958
I told you we should have
hired more women.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.958
Women don't get lost.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.166
Are you kidding me?

51:08.208 --> 51:09.625
Phil you need to...

51:09.666 --> 51:11.875
You need to turn around and
head south and in about a

51:11.916 --> 51:12.916
kilometre turn right.

51:14.041 --> 51:17.041
Now "Pink", whoever
is in Clerkenwell.

51:17.083 --> 51:19.500
Yes that would be me, George.

51:19.541 --> 51:20.666
George, you're the closest.

51:20.708 --> 51:22.208
Keep going towards the
Museum of London.

51:22.250 --> 51:23.791
You know, the big roundabout.

51:23.833 --> 51:25.875
George, slow down. You need
to wait for the others.

51:25.916 --> 51:28.083
No initiative before there's
a minimum of three skaters.

51:28.125 --> 51:29.416
Thank you.

51:29.458 --> 51:30.875
You keep telling them to
slow down. Guys go as

51:30.916 --> 51:32.416
fast as you can. This
isn't a Sunday stroll.

51:32.458 --> 51:33.708
And the rule is "two skaters".

51:33.750 --> 51:35.500
- Three.
- Three is including the killer.

51:35.541 --> 51:36.875
Didn't we say a
minimum of three skaters?

51:36.916 --> 51:38.708
- Yes we said "three skaters".
- No, we didn't!

51:38.750 --> 51:41.000
- [Roberto] My name is...
- Okay everyone stop! Stop!

51:46.250 --> 51:47.291
Why are we stopping?

51:48.500 --> 51:51.375
- No, not you, them.
- [Angela] Who's "them"?

51:51.416 --> 51:53.791
Skaters get back to skating.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.083
So we're still going
to Saint Paul's?

51:57.125 --> 51:58.625
Yes, go, go, go.

51:58.666 --> 52:00.250
The rules are very clear.

52:00.291 --> 52:02.916
Minimum two skaters,
I mean, two chasers,

52:02.958 --> 52:04.708
three including the killer.

52:04.750 --> 52:07.500
Okay, so the killer isn't
a chaser, he's a skater.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.750
So three minus one equals two.

52:09.791 --> 52:11.500
- Three.
- Makes sense?

52:14.958 --> 52:16.916
Am I on mute?

52:16.958 --> 52:18.916
They're not responding because
you're shouting at them.

52:18.958 --> 52:20.000
I am not shoot...

52:28.000 --> 52:29.375
What is he doing?

52:37.833 --> 52:39.833
Guys, the target is heading
towards the Barbican, if you

52:39.875 --> 52:41.291
could make your way
towards the Barbican.

52:41.333 --> 52:43.125
Barbican? What the fuck?

52:43.166 --> 52:44.958
I thought we were going
to Saint Paul's.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.666
Shut up Phil. Just shut up!

52:47.708 --> 52:50.916
You shut up, don't
fucking yell at me!

52:50.958 --> 52:52.125
I am not...

53:08.291 --> 53:09.875
You're alright?

53:10.875 --> 53:12.291
This is so frustrating.

53:14.083 --> 53:16.125
Here, have a glass of water.

53:16.166 --> 53:17.250
Thanks Kat.

53:22.750 --> 53:23.875
Hugh.

53:37.083 --> 53:42.125
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
virtual pigeon numero uno,

53:42.166 --> 53:43.791
the one and only.

53:43.833 --> 53:45.666
[George] Can we please
focus on the target.

53:45.708 --> 53:47.250
Okay, all right sorry.

53:47.291 --> 53:50.625
Okay ladies and gentlemen,
our target is going

53:50.666 --> 53:52.916
down Aldersgate Street.

53:52.958 --> 53:54.666
[Luis] Where is that?

53:54.708 --> 53:56.708
Passed Barbican Station.

53:56.750 --> 53:57.750
Still going.

54:01.166 --> 54:02.041
What happened?

54:06.083 --> 54:08.208
Hugh, where's my
red dot, it's gone?

54:08.250 --> 54:10.375
It's a business district,
maybe there are no video

54:10.416 --> 54:11.416
buzzers in the area.

54:11.458 --> 54:13.208
- Where's Hugh?
- Hugh's fine.

54:13.250 --> 54:15.291
I don't care if he's fine,
I need tech support, Hugh!

54:20.541 --> 54:22.083
Guys, I think I see him.

54:22.125 --> 54:23.541
[Arthur] Where?

54:23.583 --> 54:25.291
[George] Just, like you said,

54:25.333 --> 54:27.708
the big roundabout
near the Museum of London.

54:28.750 --> 54:30.583
- [Arthur] "Pink".
- [Sophie] "George".

54:30.625 --> 54:32.750
[Arthur] George, be
super careful remember,

54:32.791 --> 54:34.500
he's likely
to be armed.

54:34.541 --> 54:36.208
"Armed"?

54:36.250 --> 54:39.000
Oh hell yeah, knife, maybe more.

54:40.041 --> 54:41.958
Are you kidding me?

54:42.000 --> 54:44.833
You sound surprised. This is
no picnic, but you guys

54:44.875 --> 54:47.458
worked on this during the
fighting workshop, right?

54:47.500 --> 54:49.250
What workshop?

54:49.291 --> 54:51.083
It was supposed
to be next weekend.

54:52.666 --> 54:54.708
Where the hell
have you been?

54:54.750 --> 54:55.750
Focus.

54:58.375 --> 55:00.250
Look, I'm happy to help.

55:00.291 --> 55:02.083
I just don't want to die.

55:02.125 --> 55:05.916
No, no, no, nobody's
going to die, I think.

55:05.958 --> 55:07.708
Guys, I've got a bad
feeling about this.

55:07.750 --> 55:09.041
Let's be honest.

55:09.083 --> 55:12.833
If something goes wrong,
we're all responsible.

55:12.875 --> 55:17.250
What we're doing is called
incitement. It's a crime.

55:25.500 --> 55:28.541
Sorry to be blunt team,
but yeah, what we're doing

55:28.583 --> 55:31.166
is super dangerous.
We're not forcing anyone.

55:31.208 --> 55:33.125
If any of you don't
feel comfortable...

55:33.166 --> 55:35.708
[Luis] I don't care. He's the
one who should be afraid.

55:35.750 --> 55:38.708
[Angela] Yeah, if we don't do
anything, he's going to hurt

55:38.750 --> 55:40.291
us some day.

55:40.333 --> 55:42.000
I'm not so sure, guys.

55:42.041 --> 55:44.250
I mean, I heard Anabelle
was pregnant yesterday.

55:45.125 --> 55:47.791
Oh, well, congratulations
to you and...

55:47.833 --> 55:50.041
No no no, it's his cat.

55:50.083 --> 55:52.500
What do you mean "cat",
she's called "Cat"?

55:52.541 --> 55:54.333
No, it's a cat,
like a natural...

55:55.875 --> 55:59.666
Meow. Meow. Meow.

55:59.708 --> 56:02.291
Pregnant from whom, him?

56:02.333 --> 56:05.250
No dickhead,
from another cat.

56:05.291 --> 56:08.250
- Which one?
- How the fuck would I know?

56:08.291 --> 56:09.333
Guys!

56:09.375 --> 56:10.750
[George] You know,
I can hear you?

56:10.791 --> 56:13.166
[Arthur] Oh, sorry,
shit, I wasn't on mute.

56:13.208 --> 56:14.708
He's getting into a lift.

56:14.750 --> 56:17.916
What, a lift in the street?

56:17.958 --> 56:19.625
Yes a lift in the street.

56:23.208 --> 56:25.250
Oh, he's skating on
top of a bridge now.

56:32.666 --> 56:34.166
[Phil] Oh great, I see it.

56:34.208 --> 56:35.208
[Arthur] The killer?

56:35.250 --> 56:37.625
No, the bridge.

56:37.666 --> 56:40.250
- Yellow, yellow
- "Phil".

56:40.291 --> 56:43.916
Phil, can you describe
the bridge you see?

56:43.958 --> 56:45.833
[Phil] It's the one with
the two big towers on it.

56:47.750 --> 56:48.583
What?

56:50.083 --> 56:51.750
Phil, are you honestly trying
to tell me that you're at

56:51.791 --> 56:53.000
Tower Bridge right now?

56:53.041 --> 56:54.791
You said "go west".

56:56.041 --> 56:57.541
You're miles away
from the target.

56:57.583 --> 56:59.958
Jesus, "yellow" you're not
even trying, are you mate?

57:00.000 --> 57:02.291
Oh, "I'm not even trying"?

57:02.333 --> 57:04.333
Phil, do not take
the bridge, okay?

57:04.375 --> 57:06.666
You need to go north,
not south, north.

57:06.708 --> 57:10.208
[Luis] Hey, guys, I found a
lift, I go up one level.

57:11.083 --> 57:13.416
[Angela] This is Angela,
where exactly is the lift?

57:13.458 --> 57:15.666
[Luis] On London Wall, there
is a number of lifts.

57:20.416 --> 57:22.750
He stopped make sure you
don't go too fast, Luis.

57:28.458 --> 57:30.541
[Angela] We're in Farringdon,
we'll get there soon.

57:30.583 --> 57:32.000
[George] You've got to
hide when you arrive.

57:32.041 --> 57:33.958
[George] He's got
a vantage point.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.541
Who needs to hide, me?

57:36.583 --> 57:38.375
No Phil, you don't need
to hide from the killer

57:38.416 --> 57:40.750
because you're in
the wrong fucking city!

57:40.791 --> 57:42.250
You know what? Fuck you guys!

57:42.291 --> 57:44.208
I'm out of this shit.

57:44.250 --> 57:48.208
It's okay, good riddance.
He was slowing us down.

57:48.250 --> 57:50.166
Why are you yelling
at the skaters?

57:50.208 --> 57:51.333
We already don't have
enough of them.

57:51.375 --> 57:52.291
Oh, I'm yelling at them?

57:58.166 --> 57:59.750
[George] He is
on the move now.

58:06.333 --> 58:08.125
[Luis] I think I see him,
black hoodie, right?

58:11.458 --> 58:14.958
Yes, I see you Luis,
right behind him right?

58:15.000 --> 58:17.083
Grey and black top, right?.

58:17.125 --> 58:18.791
[Luis] Yeah, that's
me, I'm on his tail.

58:20.291 --> 58:22.916
- Don't go to close Luis.
- Again you're holding them off.

58:22.958 --> 58:25.125
You can extrapolate Luis'
position to estimate where

58:25.166 --> 58:26.125
the target is.

58:27.333 --> 58:28.708
What?

58:28.750 --> 58:31.333
Luis is purple dot, he's
following our target so we

58:31.375 --> 58:34.125
can assume the target
is here, in red.

58:34.166 --> 58:37.208
Yes Hugh, extrapolate,
extrapolate as much as you want.

58:45.500 --> 58:47.625
[George] He's still
going east for now.

58:51.291 --> 58:53.416
[Luis] Oh shit.
I think he saw me.

58:53.458 --> 58:54.875
He's going faster.

59:05.250 --> 59:08.166
He's crossing the bridge.
He's going to take the ramp.

59:08.208 --> 59:10.458
- The "wamp"?
- The "ramp".

59:10.500 --> 59:12.375
What is he talking about?

59:27.875 --> 59:30.750
What the hell, how can they
be on top of each other?

59:49.625 --> 59:51.041
Shit.

59:53.416 --> 59:54.416
[Angela] We found the lift.

59:54.458 --> 59:56.791
We're arriving
at the bridge level.

59:56.833 --> 1:00:00.250
[Luis] No no don't, we're
down to street level now.

1:00:00.291 --> 1:00:03.666
[Angela] Street level?
Why didn't you say so?

1:00:03.708 --> 1:00:06.041
[Luis] I told you we
were taking the ramp.

1:00:06.083 --> 1:00:07.875
[Angela] What's a "ramper"?

1:00:10.583 --> 1:00:13.541
[Angela] We saw you,
we're trying to catch up.

1:00:13.583 --> 1:00:16.125
Luis, he is at
street level, right?

1:00:16.166 --> 1:00:17.000
[Luis] No.

1:00:19.958 --> 1:00:22.125
No. He's underground.

1:00:22.166 --> 1:00:23.625
What the fuck?

1:00:23.666 --> 1:00:25.041
Luis, where are you?

1:00:25.083 --> 1:00:25.958
[unintelligible]

1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:32.916
- [unintelligible]
- Can you hear me guys?

1:00:35.041 --> 1:00:36.333
[Luis] [unintelligible]

1:00:37.750 --> 1:00:39.000
He's underground, that's why

1:00:39.041 --> 1:00:40.791
the sound's breaking.

1:00:40.833 --> 1:00:42.666
[Angela] Luis, how do you
access the level down?

1:00:43.958 --> 1:00:44.875
[unintelligible]

1:00:45.958 --> 1:00:46.750
Fuck!

1:01:16.875 --> 1:01:18.458
Luis?

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:21.375
- Luis?
- We lost connection.

1:01:22.291 --> 1:01:24.500
[Angela] Arthur, how do you
access the level down?

1:01:24.541 --> 1:01:26.208
I don't know.

1:01:26.250 --> 1:01:28.500
[Angela] Well you should know
with all your fancy tools.

1:01:28.541 --> 1:01:29.958
This is bullshit!

1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:31.791
[Angela] You're not
really helping here.

1:01:35.666 --> 1:01:37.166
Hey, guys, it's George.

1:01:38.666 --> 1:01:40.791
I'm going to go home guys.

1:01:40.833 --> 1:01:42.041
I'm sorry.

1:01:44.166 --> 1:01:46.041
[Fast music]

1:02:55.708 --> 1:02:58.000
[Religious music]

1:02:58.041 --> 1:03:00.208
[Tap water running]

1:03:02.166 --> 1:03:04.125
Are you feeling all right?

1:03:06.916 --> 1:03:08.708
[Water thrown]

1:03:08.750 --> 1:03:10.541
[Phone rings]

1:03:10.583 --> 1:03:11.625
Yeah.

1:03:15.166 --> 1:03:18.750
Oh, come on, what do you
want me to do, beg you?

1:03:18.791 --> 1:03:21.750
Okay great, you
think about it then.

1:03:26.875 --> 1:03:30.000
[water tap dripping]

1:03:44.250 --> 1:03:45.041
Really?

1:03:50.416 --> 1:03:51.500
Are you kidding me?

1:03:52.791 --> 1:03:53.833
What?

1:03:53.875 --> 1:03:56.666
What is this doing
in the recycling?

1:03:58.291 --> 1:03:59.666
It's not mine.

1:04:01.041 --> 1:04:02.083
What are you eating?

1:04:04.041 --> 1:04:05.333
This?

1:04:06.875 --> 1:04:09.666
This one came without a peel.

1:04:15.416 --> 1:04:17.791
Look, it's a like paper, okay?

1:04:17.833 --> 1:04:21.416
Paper grows on trees,
bananas grow on trees.

1:04:21.458 --> 1:04:24.500
We recycle paper, we should
recycle banana leaves too.

1:04:25.875 --> 1:04:27.958
What are they going
to recycle them into?

1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.166
I don't know, they'll plant
them into the ground and

1:04:30.208 --> 1:04:32.041
they'll grow into a
new banana tree.

1:04:33.791 --> 1:04:34.875
Really?

1:04:36.750 --> 1:04:40.791
Look, I know about
computers and Hollywood.

1:04:40.833 --> 1:04:46.041
Don't ask me about how to
grow banana trees, what the

1:04:46.083 --> 1:04:49.333
difference between a
satsuma and an orange is,

1:04:49.375 --> 1:04:52.708
how to determine the gender of
a chicken, what the difference

1:04:52.750 --> 1:04:55.625
between an easy peeler
and a tangerine is.

1:04:55.666 --> 1:04:58.083
Why some apples are
called Granny Smith.

1:04:58.125 --> 1:05:01.166
Who's Granny Smith's cat?
I don't know, I don't care.

1:05:14.375 --> 1:05:15.541
Oh, whatever.

1:05:16.875 --> 1:05:18.666
If anyone wants me,
I'll be in my room.

1:05:18.708 --> 1:05:20.125
Me too.

1:05:20.166 --> 1:05:21.125
"My room"?

1:05:22.958 --> 1:05:24.666
No, I meant...

1:05:24.708 --> 1:05:26.958
I meant "my room", not your...

1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:28.750
I meant my room.

1:05:29.625 --> 1:05:30.791
I'm kidding.

1:05:40.583 --> 1:05:43.250
What shall we do? Go home?

1:05:43.291 --> 1:05:46.791
I'm going to tighten
my wheels first.

1:05:54.583 --> 1:05:56.500
[Angela] Guys, we are
thinking of going home.

1:05:57.625 --> 1:05:58.541
Guys?

1:05:59.708 --> 1:06:01.833
[Fast music]

1:06:23.291 --> 1:06:24.875
[Angela] Guys!

1:06:24.916 --> 1:06:26.000
Guys are you here?

1:06:27.958 --> 1:06:29.208
[Angela] We see him.

1:06:31.333 --> 1:06:32.333
Hugh!

1:06:37.083 --> 1:06:38.541
Hi, yes.

1:06:38.583 --> 1:06:40.750
Angela, I can hear you.

1:06:40.791 --> 1:06:43.000
Hugh! It's back on again.

1:06:43.041 --> 1:06:46.916
No, no, no, I can't do
all this computer stuff.

1:06:46.958 --> 1:06:48.666
You do it.

1:06:48.708 --> 1:06:50.625
- Me?
- Yeah, go go, go!

1:06:50.666 --> 1:06:51.500
Yeah.

1:06:52.541 --> 1:06:55.041
Luis, Luis can you hear me?

1:06:57.208 --> 1:06:59.791
Angela, Tony, can
you hear me ?

1:06:59.833 --> 1:07:02.541
[Angela] Yes we can. We
see Luis and the killer,

1:07:02.583 --> 1:07:04.875
they're about 30 meters away.

1:07:04.916 --> 1:07:07.083
Hugh, are these two
Angela and Tony?

1:07:08.375 --> 1:07:09.958
Yes.

1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:13.041
So the other two
must be about here.

1:07:16.166 --> 1:07:16.916
There.

1:07:23.916 --> 1:07:25.416
Yes, tag him.

1:07:46.625 --> 1:07:47.958
Can you extrapolate
to get Luis?

1:07:56.875 --> 1:07:58.500
[Tony] Luis we're behind
you, can you hear us?

1:08:28.333 --> 1:08:29.291
Hey Angela, wait.

1:08:30.666 --> 1:08:32.041
Why?

1:08:32.083 --> 1:08:33.541
[Tony] It's not safe.

1:08:35.125 --> 1:08:38.750
[Angela] Guys, Luis and the
killer are in some dodgy alleys,

1:08:39.666 --> 1:08:41.541
it seems really dangerous.

1:08:41.583 --> 1:08:44.041
Don't go if
you don't feel safe.

1:08:44.083 --> 1:08:46.291
There doesn't seem to be much
camera coverage down there.

1:08:46.333 --> 1:08:48.458
[Phone rings]
There has to be cameras.

1:08:48.500 --> 1:08:49.291
Yeah.

1:08:51.125 --> 1:08:52.208
Really?

1:08:53.375 --> 1:08:55.041
Yeah, no, okay. Brilliant.

1:08:55.916 --> 1:08:58.250
I'll loop you in. Hang on.

1:09:02.791 --> 1:09:03.958
Don't do that.

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:05.208
There's got to be at
least one camera.

1:09:05.250 --> 1:09:08.041
This is very CPU intensive.

1:09:08.083 --> 1:09:09.875
It can overload the system.

1:09:12.708 --> 1:09:14.250
Oh oh.

1:09:14.291 --> 1:09:16.375
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1:09:17.916 --> 1:09:19.791
God, I've always
wanted to do that.

1:09:20.958 --> 1:09:22.250
Sorry.

1:09:22.291 --> 1:09:23.958
No, no, no, you're right.

1:09:25.791 --> 1:09:28.333
- I think I'm going to cry.
- Oh no.

1:09:28.375 --> 1:09:29.541
Don't worry about it.

1:09:29.583 --> 1:09:31.333
[Luis screams]

1:09:31.375 --> 1:09:32.375
[Tension music]

1:09:36.583 --> 1:09:38.083
Guys, what's happening?

1:09:49.833 --> 1:09:50.708
Over there.

1:09:52.291 --> 1:09:53.041
[Angela] Oh shit.

1:10:04.208 --> 1:10:06.291
[Angela] Guys, Luis is hurt.

1:10:06.333 --> 1:10:08.708
Oh my god, is he alright?

1:10:08.750 --> 1:10:10.708
I need to hang up.
I have to call an ambulance.

1:10:11.666 --> 1:10:14.125
- Can you loop him in?
- Sorry what?

1:10:14.166 --> 1:10:16.666
Put him in the conf call
and tracking system thingy.

1:10:18.125 --> 1:10:19.416
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:10:22.041 --> 1:10:24.291
Sorry Tony, I can't
help you right now.

1:10:24.333 --> 1:10:25.375
Tada.

1:10:28.166 --> 1:10:29.500
Who's that?

1:10:29.541 --> 1:10:32.250
[Leo] Guys, can you hear me?

1:10:32.291 --> 1:10:33.958
What!

1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.583
[Tony] Hey Leo,
is that you man?

1:10:35.625 --> 1:10:37.208
You bet.

1:10:37.250 --> 1:10:39.083
[Leo] Tony, long
time no see.

1:10:40.791 --> 1:10:42.208
It's not about you Soph,

1:10:42.250 --> 1:10:44.500
we've got to catch this
guy, whatever it takes.

1:10:44.541 --> 1:10:46.666
Well, you talk to him
since you like him so much.

1:10:46.708 --> 1:10:48.791
- Why are you being so...
- So what?

1:10:50.208 --> 1:10:51.166
Nothing.

1:11:03.750 --> 1:11:07.458
Hey Leo, please go towards...

1:11:07.500 --> 1:11:08.500
Holborn Viaduct.

1:11:09.083 --> 1:11:10.708
Holborn Viaduct.

1:11:13.416 --> 1:11:14.791
God, he's so fast.

1:11:30.541 --> 1:11:32.166
[Leo] I'm approaching Holborn
but I can't see anyone.

1:11:33.250 --> 1:11:34.541
Where exactly are you?

1:11:39.125 --> 1:11:42.125
Tony, is that you?
I think I just saw you.

1:11:42.166 --> 1:11:43.833
No Leo, it's definitely
not Tony, he's in

1:11:43.875 --> 1:11:45.166
a different location.

1:11:53.041 --> 1:11:55.625
I think that's our target,
he's heading south.

1:11:55.666 --> 1:11:57.583
Hugh, how do you
do the rectangle stuff?

1:11:57.625 --> 1:12:00.000
- Just drag and click.
- I can't do it.

1:12:18.833 --> 1:12:20.875
Tony, take a left right now.

1:12:20.916 --> 1:12:23.333
It's a large road,
Farringdon road.

1:12:36.625 --> 1:12:37.833
This is going to be epic.

1:12:37.875 --> 1:12:39.166
Hugh do you mind if I
connect the projector?

1:12:39.208 --> 1:12:40.791
- What for?
- Just say "yes".

1:12:40.833 --> 1:12:42.666
- Yes.
- Cool!

1:12:42.708 --> 1:12:43.541
To what?

1:13:09.041 --> 1:13:11.000
Tony I can see you,
I'm right on your tail.

1:14:05.625 --> 1:14:07.291
Man, what happened?

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.208
Tony, are your alright?

1:14:18.541 --> 1:14:20.041
Is Tony back on track?

1:14:20.916 --> 1:14:22.750
No, I think he handed
the camera to...

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:24.166
Hello!

1:14:25.125 --> 1:14:28.458
Look Leo, we've go a rule,
it's minimum two skaters.

1:14:28.500 --> 1:14:30.500
You have a rule, I don't.

1:14:30.541 --> 1:14:32.000
Kat, he needs to stop.

1:14:34.916 --> 1:14:37.541
Leo, it's Sophie here.

1:14:37.583 --> 1:14:39.125
[Leo] Oh, finally!

1:14:39.166 --> 1:14:42.333
The kind of shit I need to do
to get your attention, right?

1:14:43.541 --> 1:14:46.541
OK, well done you win.
Now stop skating please.

1:14:46.583 --> 1:14:49.000
The moment I stop skating,
you're going to hang up.

1:14:49.041 --> 1:14:52.541
No, I promise we'll talk.
But just us.

1:14:52.583 --> 1:14:54.291
[Leo] I want to
catch him anyway.

1:14:54.333 --> 1:14:56.708
So, how have
you been honey?

1:14:56.750 --> 1:14:59.083
- Shall we...?
- No!

1:14:59.125 --> 1:15:01.166
[Leo] Why are you always running
away from me like this?

1:15:01.208 --> 1:15:03.291
I get that you need a bit
of distance from all of this,

1:15:03.333 --> 1:15:05.291
but why won't you
at least return my calls?

1:15:05.333 --> 1:15:06.500
That's not relevant.

1:15:06.541 --> 1:15:08.458
[Leo] Babe I can't
sleep, I can't even eat.

1:15:08.500 --> 1:15:10.375
Leo, everyone is listening.
This isn't the time.

1:15:10.416 --> 1:15:11.833
[Leo] Every day
I think about you.

1:15:11.875 --> 1:15:14.291
I need to hear your voice.
I need you in my life Soph.

1:15:14.333 --> 1:15:15.750
Me me me.

1:15:15.791 --> 1:15:19.708
My life, my food, my
precious little sleep.

1:15:19.750 --> 1:15:21.583
Do you even care
about how I feel?

1:15:25.708 --> 1:15:29.166
I've been avoiding you and
this conversation because

1:15:29.208 --> 1:15:30.375
I'm fucking scared.

1:15:35.875 --> 1:15:37.291
I'm scared of how you'll
react to the truth.

1:15:38.291 --> 1:15:39.625
Scared of your anger,

1:15:39.666 --> 1:15:42.375
I'm scared of your volatility.
I worry you might...

1:15:44.875 --> 1:15:46.416
Hurt yourself.

1:15:51.791 --> 1:15:53.541
This relationship has never
been about you and me,

1:15:53.583 --> 1:15:55.916
it's always been about you.

1:15:56.791 --> 1:15:59.416
It never made me happy
and you didn't even notice.

1:16:03.833 --> 1:16:06.250
I love you Leo, but not
in the way you want me to.

1:16:07.541 --> 1:16:10.541
You need to move on.
I've moved on, I...

1:16:17.333 --> 1:16:18.375
I moved on.

[Hugh] Come on,
it's just 15 steps.

1:21:33.750 --> 1:21:35.875

It will be easier.

leading him on.

you put your helmet on?
