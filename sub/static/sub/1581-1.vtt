[ lock clicks ]

16:53.548 --> 16:55.416
Okay.

16:57.319 --> 16:58.452
Weird.

17:06.861 --> 17:08.962
Might be worth something.

17:24.346 --> 17:26.046
Whoa.

17:30.418 --> 17:32.052
Kanan: Careful.

17:32.054 --> 17:33.153
You'll cut

But it's like this thing
wanted me to take it.

17:41.097 --> 17:41.095
You're right.

17:41.097 --> 17:44.932
I <i> don't</i> believe you.
Now hand me the lightsaber.

17:44.934 --> 17:48.168
Lightsaber? Isn't that
the weapon of the jedi?

17:48.170 --> 17:50.437
Give it to me
and get out.

you're not thieves exactly.

18:18.401 --> 18:19.967
We're not exactly
anything.

18:19.969 --> 18:23.303
We're a crew, a team,
in some ways a family.

18:26.574 --> 18:29.042
What happened
to your real family?

sound the alarm.

Most of
these wookiees

Were soldiers
for the old republic.

They saved
some of my people.

If we're going
to save them,

19:10.686 --> 19:10.684
We've got
a tight window.

19:10.686 --> 19:14.188
They've been taken to
an unknown slave labor camp.

19:14.190 --> 19:15.689
If we don't intercept
this ship,

19:15.691 --> 19:16.990
We'll never find them.

I'm not against
sticking it to the empire,

I'd stick my neck out this far.

We do.

to look that way.
