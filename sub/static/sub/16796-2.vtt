00:05.026 --> 00:07.068
<i> ( theme music playing )</i>

01:44.000 --> 01:46.042
Man's voice:
<i> Wake up, Dolores.</i>

02:09.275 --> 02:10.983
<i> Do you remember?</i>

02:11.027 --> 02:14.529
<i> ( heart beating )</i>

02:32.924 --> 02:34.924
<i> ( woman clears throat )</i>

02:36.052 --> 02:38.136
Woman:
<i> We're about to arrive.</i>

02:38.179 --> 02:39.720
May I take your glass?

02:41.683 --> 02:44.725
Woman on P.A.:
<i> Now approaching</i>
<i> arrival terminal.</i>

02:44.769 --> 02:48.146
Where we're going,
she's a two.

02:48.189 --> 02:50.565
You're being an asshole.

02:50.608 --> 02:54.235
No, I am being myself,

02:54.279 --> 02:56.195
which was the whole
point of this trip.

02:56.239 --> 02:59.031
Unless this uptight prick
is who you really are,

02:59.075 --> 03:01.284
in which case,
feel free to be
someone else.

03:01.327 --> 03:02.785
Fuck you.

03:02.829 --> 03:04.704
Hey, that's the spirit.

03:18.344 --> 03:20.761
What'd I tell you?

03:20.805 --> 03:21.679
Have fun.

03:21.723 --> 03:24.348
Stay safe.

03:24.392 --> 03:25.349
Give me a break.

03:25.393 --> 03:28.102
What?

03:28.146 --> 03:29.353
It's not like
my sister didn't ride

03:29.397 --> 03:30.396
her share of cowboys
when she was here.

03:34.527 --> 03:38.321
You must be William.
Welcome to Westworld.

03:38.364 --> 03:40.406
Thanks.

03:40.450 --> 03:43.409
Given it's your first
visit, I have a few
personal questions.

03:43.453 --> 03:46.871
Do you have any preexisting
medical conditions?

03:46.915 --> 03:48.539
No, not that I know of.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.374
- Heart problems?
- No.

03:50.418 --> 03:51.667
Any history
of mental illness,
depression,

03:51.711 --> 03:54.587
panic attacks?

03:54.631 --> 03:56.380
Just a little fear
of clowns.

03:57.550 --> 03:59.133
I'm joking.

03:59.177 --> 04:01.344
Do you often experience
social anxiety?

04:04.766 --> 04:06.432
What is this for,
exactly?

04:06.476 --> 04:09.560
To make sure we don't
give you anything more
than you can handle.

04:09.604 --> 04:12.021
I thought that you
couldn't get hurt here.

04:12.065 --> 04:14.649
Only the right amount.

04:18.905 --> 04:20.905
The only limit here
is your imagination.

04:20.949 --> 04:24.033
You start in
the center of the park.
It's simple, safe.

04:24.077 --> 04:27.828
<i> The further out</i>
<i> you venture, the more</i>
<i> intense the experience gets.</i>

04:27.872 --> 04:31.207
How far you want to go
is entirely up to you.

04:39.592 --> 04:42.927
So, how does this work?
Is there an orientation?

04:42.971 --> 04:45.221
No orientation,

04:45.265 --> 04:47.181
no guidebook.

04:47.225 --> 04:50.518
Figuring out how it works
is half the fun.

04:50.561 --> 04:52.645
All you do
is make choices...

04:52.689 --> 04:54.522
starting here.

04:54.565 --> 04:58.985
Everything is bespoke
and exactly your size.

05:05.451 --> 05:08.744
You want to ask,
so ask.

05:08.788 --> 05:11.330
Are you real?

05:11.374 --> 05:15.167
Well, if you can't tell,
does it matter?

05:19.966 --> 05:22.049
Are those real?

05:22.093 --> 05:24.010
<i> Real enough.</i>

05:24.053 --> 05:27.096
<i> But you can't kill anyone</i>
<i> you're not supposed to.</i>

05:30.768 --> 05:33.060
Anything you like?

05:36.733 --> 05:38.816
Is there a changing room?

05:38.860 --> 05:40.901
Or a robe?

05:40.945 --> 05:42.528
Of course.
I can help you.

05:42.572 --> 05:46.490
Or if you prefer,
I could step outside.

05:48.119 --> 05:50.453
What do most people do?

05:50.496 --> 05:53.873
You don't have
to worry about what
most people would do.

05:56.002 --> 05:57.752
I understand.

05:59.797 --> 06:02.048
Do you really
understand, William?

06:06.387 --> 06:09.680
All our hosts
are here for you.

06:09.724 --> 06:12.266
Myself included.

06:12.310 --> 06:14.060
We could stay here
a while if you like.

06:14.103 --> 06:16.896
Take as long as you want.

06:21.319 --> 06:23.486
Thank you.

06:23.529 --> 06:25.738
I don't want to keep
my friend waiting.

06:25.782 --> 06:27.823
Of course.

06:27.867 --> 06:29.450
Take your time.

06:40.838 --> 06:42.922
How are the builds
for the new narrative
coming along?

06:42.965 --> 06:46.467
I'll get around to it.

06:46.511 --> 06:50.096
Look, we assumed
that Abernathy's breach

06:50.139 --> 06:52.390
was triggered
by the photograph
that he found.

06:52.433 --> 06:54.767
I've reviewed
every dissonant episode
I could find.

06:54.811 --> 06:57.144
The reaction
is immediate every time.

06:57.188 --> 07:00.815
This guy makes it
all the way back home.

07:00.858 --> 07:03.567
It's like
he's mulling it over.

07:03.611 --> 07:07.822
You think he had
an existential crisis?

07:07.865 --> 07:11.409
I think there's
something fucked up
going on with his cognition.

07:11.452 --> 07:14.036
And I think you feel
exactly the same way
that I do.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.330
Do we know where
the error originated?

07:16.374 --> 07:18.582
We do.

07:18.626 --> 07:20.000
And you covered for him.

07:21.129 --> 07:24.088
Let me rebuild Abernathy.

07:24.132 --> 07:25.339
I'll make sure
this is not something
more serious.

07:25.383 --> 07:29.051
You know the policy.
Let it lie.

07:29.095 --> 07:32.304
Then let me at least
pull the hosts who had
contact with him,

07:32.348 --> 07:34.640
like the daughter Dolores.

07:34.684 --> 07:36.308
What for?

07:36.352 --> 07:39.478
Because if this is not
a dissonant episode,

07:39.522 --> 07:43.941
then whatever Abernathy had
could be contagious.

07:45.611 --> 07:46.902
So to speak.

07:46.946 --> 07:49.780
Dolores was examined
and cleared.

07:49.824 --> 07:54.368
And the stories are
best left to the guests.

07:58.666 --> 08:00.749
( chatter )

08:09.218 --> 08:13.804
<i> ( chatter grows louder )</i>

08:17.185 --> 08:19.185
<i> ( people shouting,</i>
<i> echoing )</i>

08:19.228 --> 08:21.812
Man's voice:
<i> Remember.</i>

08:21.856 --> 08:23.397
<i> ( voices fade )</i>

08:33.910 --> 08:36.994
<i> ( people screaming )</i>

08:46.631 --> 08:50.007
Ahem.
Can you stand
somewhere else?

08:50.051 --> 08:54.053
I don't want anyone thinking
that you're representative
of the goods inside.

08:57.099 --> 09:00.518
These violent delights

09:00.561 --> 09:02.645
have violent ends.

09:02.688 --> 09:04.855
( scoffs )

09:07.318 --> 09:09.401
<i> ( piano playing )</i>

09:22.833 --> 09:24.291
Hello, cowboy.

09:24.335 --> 09:26.627
There's one final touch.

09:28.714 --> 09:30.589
Which would you prefer?

09:58.828 --> 10:01.954
-<i> ( piano playing )</i>
-<i> ( chatter )</i>

10:34.447 --> 10:38.073
( sighs )
I mean, can you
believe this place?

10:38.117 --> 10:41.285
<i> ( rumbling )</i>

10:43.456 --> 10:45.372
So, how do we get
into the park?

10:45.416 --> 10:48.292
<i> ( rumbling, rattling )</i>

11:02.183 --> 11:04.141
( whistle blowing )

11:04.185 --> 11:07.603
I know that you think
you have a handle on what
this is gonna be.

11:10.149 --> 11:12.691
Guns and tits
and all that.

11:12.735 --> 11:14.943
Mindless shit
that I usually enjoy.

11:17.448 --> 11:20.574
<i> You have no idea.</i>

11:20.618 --> 11:24.953
This place seduces
everybody eventually.

11:24.997 --> 11:27.206
By the end, you're gonna
be begging me to stay

11:27.249 --> 11:29.792
because this place
is the answer

11:29.835 --> 11:32.461
to that question that
you've been asking yourself.

11:32.505 --> 11:34.672
What question?

11:34.715 --> 11:35.798
Who you really are.

11:37.968 --> 11:40.469
And I can't fucking wait
to meet that guy.

11:43.724 --> 11:44.348
( clinks )

11:44.392 --> 11:46.642
Bottoms up, cowboy.

11:46.686 --> 11:48.477
( chuckles )

11:54.568 --> 11:56.443
Sheriff:
<i> Further to that,</i>

11:56.487 --> 11:58.153
<i> the ruthless murder</i>
<i> of Donald Pardue</i>

11:58.197 --> 12:01.073
and his brother.

12:01.117 --> 12:03.617
For these crimes,
you will be hung
from the neck

12:03.661 --> 12:05.369
until your diseased soul
has found its measure

12:05.413 --> 12:08.330
in the flames below.

12:08.374 --> 12:10.416
And may God have mercy
on your soul.

12:10.459 --> 12:13.544
<i> ( hoofbeats approach )</i>

12:13.587 --> 12:15.212
<i> ( horse nickers )</i>

12:28.477 --> 12:30.185
Morning, Lawrence.

12:30.229 --> 12:33.021
<i> You helping them</i>
<i> straighten out their</i>
<i> rope again?</i>

12:33.065 --> 12:35.691
I was hoping to have
a word with my friend here.

12:35.735 --> 12:39.111
You can have as many words
with him as you like

12:39.155 --> 12:41.447
soon as his neck
is broke.

12:41.490 --> 12:43.866
Well, I'm afraid that's
not gonna work for me.

12:47.413 --> 12:51.331
How about I tell my man
there to dig that grave
a couple feet deeper?

12:53.377 --> 12:55.878
Well, it's gonna be
an awful tight fit
for all of you.

13:05.473 --> 13:08.056
( guns cock )

13:08.100 --> 13:11.310
-<i> ( gunshots )</i>
-<i> ( men grunting )</i>

13:17.610 --> 13:19.193
-<i> ( gunshots stop )</i>
-<i> ( bodies thud )</i>

13:19.236 --> 13:22.070
<i> ( man panting )</i>
<i> Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</i>

13:22.114 --> 13:22.821
<i> Oh, shit!</i>

13:22.865 --> 13:25.574
-<i> ( gunshot )</i>
- Ah!

13:35.795 --> 13:38.754
-<i> ( gun clicking )</i>
-<i> ( shells clinking )</i>

13:43.052 --> 13:44.218
Motherfucker.

13:44.261 --> 13:48.388
That's the best thanks
you can muster, Lawrence?

13:48.432 --> 13:50.474
You used to be
a little more eloquent.

13:50.518 --> 13:54.228
Do I-- do I know you?

13:54.271 --> 13:57.064
Your pal Kissy
sent me your way.

13:57.107 --> 13:57.940
Sends his regards.

14:05.574 --> 14:06.824
What-- what is this?

14:09.578 --> 14:11.370
You know exactly
what it is.

14:11.413 --> 14:14.122
It's the maze,

14:14.166 --> 14:16.500
<i>the deepest level</i>
<i>of this game.</i>

14:16.544 --> 14:17.960
You're gonna help me
find the entrance.

14:20.673 --> 14:20.838
No.

14:22.925 --> 14:25.717
( whimpers, grunting )

14:35.020 --> 14:37.104
( piano playing )

14:40.109 --> 14:42.401
Maeve's voice:
<i> You can hear it,</i>
<i> can't you?</i>

14:42.444 --> 14:45.362
<i> That little voice.</i>

14:45.406 --> 14:47.281
<i> The one that's</i>
<i> telling you "don't."</i>

14:47.324 --> 14:49.074
<i> Don't stare too long.</i>

14:49.118 --> 14:51.702
<i> Don't touch.</i>

14:51.745 --> 14:52.828
<i> Don't do anything</i>
<i> you might regret.</i>

14:54.748 --> 14:56.540
<i> I used to be the same.</i>

14:56.584 --> 14:59.334
Whenever I wanted something,
I could hear that voice

14:59.378 --> 15:01.753
telling me to stop,
to be careful,

15:01.797 --> 15:05.173
to leave most
of my life unlived.

15:05.217 --> 15:08.051
You know the only place
that voice left me alone?

15:09.388 --> 15:11.471
In my dreams.

15:11.515 --> 15:14.600
I was free.
I could be as good

15:14.643 --> 15:17.936
or as bad
as I felt like being.

15:17.980 --> 15:20.063
And if I wanted
something,

15:20.107 --> 15:22.816
I could just
reach out and take it.

15:25.863 --> 15:27.279
But then I would wake up

15:27.323 --> 15:28.989
and the voice would
start all over again.

15:31.327 --> 15:33.911
So I ran away.

15:33.954 --> 15:36.204
Crossed the shining sea.

15:36.248 --> 15:39.124
And when I finally set foot
back on solid ground,

15:39.168 --> 15:42.210
the first thing I heard
was that goddamn voice.

15:43.881 --> 15:45.380
Do you know what it said?

15:50.346 --> 15:52.512
It said...

15:54.350 --> 15:55.849
( gasping )

15:59.355 --> 16:02.189
I'm sorry, will you
please excuse me?

16:07.237 --> 16:10.238
Man:
<i> All right, Maeve,</i>
<i> what did it say?</i>

16:10.282 --> 16:13.325
Maeve:
<i> It said, "This is</i>
<i> the new world.</i>

16:13.369 --> 16:14.910
And in this world,

16:14.954 --> 16:17.913
you can be whoever
the fuck you want."

16:17.957 --> 16:20.749
Pupillary response is good.
Smile is good.

16:20.793 --> 16:24.002
I'd fuck her.
What's the problem?

16:24.046 --> 16:25.754
Woman:
The guests wouldn't.

16:25.798 --> 16:27.047
Sizemore is launching
some huge new storyline

16:27.091 --> 16:30.008
and he wants us
to clear out the deadweight.

16:30.052 --> 16:33.387
<i> If we don't get</i>
<i> her numbers back up,</i>
<i> she'll be decommissioned.</i>

16:33.430 --> 16:34.554
<i> Let's bump</i>
<i> her aggression.</i>

16:34.598 --> 16:37.474
- 10%?
-<i> Double it.</i>

16:37.518 --> 16:39.309
<i> She's a hooker.</i>
<i> No point in playing coy.</i>

16:39.353 --> 16:42.187
<i> If this doesn't work,</i>
<i> we'll punt her to behavior.</i>

16:42.231 --> 16:43.689
<i> Let them deal with it.</i>

17:03.127 --> 17:05.293
We retired the two hosts
in question.

17:06.213 --> 17:08.463
You taught me
how to make them,

17:08.507 --> 17:11.216
but not how hard it is
to turn them off.

17:11.260 --> 17:15.012
You can't play God
without being acquainted
with the devil.

17:15.055 --> 17:18.974
There's something else
bothering you, Bernard.

17:19.018 --> 17:21.727
I know how that
head of yours works.

17:21.770 --> 17:23.395
The photograph alone

17:23.439 --> 17:26.857
couldn't have
caused that level
of damage to Abernathy,

17:26.900 --> 17:30.318
not without some other
outside interference.

17:32.156 --> 17:33.363
You think it's sabotage?

17:33.407 --> 17:37.909
Imagine someone's been
diddling with our creations?

17:37.953 --> 17:41.538
It's the simplest
solution.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.540
Ah, Mr. Occam's razor.

17:43.584 --> 17:47.210
The problem, Bernard,
is that what you and I do

17:47.254 --> 17:51.757
is so complicated.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.343
We practice witchcraft.

17:57.306 --> 18:00.390
We speak the right words.

18:00.434 --> 18:02.434
<i> Then we create</i>
<i> life itself...</i>

18:03.896 --> 18:05.979
out of chaos.

18:06.023 --> 18:07.981
<i> ( machinery whirring )</i>

18:10.110 --> 18:13.445
William of Occam
was a 13th century monk.

18:13.489 --> 18:14.988
He can't help us now,
Bernard.

18:15.032 --> 18:18.075
He would have us
burned at the stake.

18:24.374 --> 18:26.083
( whistle blowing )

18:36.095 --> 18:38.178
Let's go get
our feet wet, buckaroo.

18:44.937 --> 18:47.646
<i> ( bell ringing )</i>

18:54.780 --> 18:56.822
( clinking )

19:01.787 --> 19:03.829
Oh, sorry.

19:03.872 --> 19:05.956
- You kidding me?
- What?

19:05.999 --> 19:07.833
Fuck you,
Grizzly Adams.

19:07.876 --> 19:11.086
Man:
<i> Rally for the Union.</i>

19:11.130 --> 19:13.755
<i> Respond to your</i>
<i> country's call.</i>

19:13.799 --> 19:15.632
This regiment is headed
for the seat of war

19:15.676 --> 19:17.175
to define the future
of this great nation.

19:17.219 --> 19:21.471
We fight for a free land
where no man has to bow.

19:21.515 --> 19:23.473
- This is, uh--
- Man:<i> We'll provide you</i>
<i> with uniforms.</i>

19:23.517 --> 19:25.475
Well, it's bigger than
I thought it would be.

19:25.519 --> 19:28.061
What, this?
This is just Sweetwater.

19:28.105 --> 19:29.104
Wait till you see
the rest of the park.

19:29.148 --> 19:31.857
- How much bigger is it?
- No idea.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.859
I never reached the end.

19:33.902 --> 19:37.779
See something you like?

19:37.823 --> 19:39.322
A couple things
at least.

19:39.366 --> 19:42.492
But I'm gonna make you
beg for it, darlin'.

19:44.454 --> 19:47.747
- Driver: Hah, come on!
- ( man grunts )

19:47.791 --> 19:50.250
- Whoa.
-<i> ( man #2 groans )</i>

19:50.294 --> 19:52.502
Need a hand, sir?

19:54.464 --> 19:56.381
Thank you, my friend.

19:56.425 --> 19:59.384
Don't. He'll only try
to rope you into some
bullshit treasure hunt.

19:59.428 --> 20:01.678
Smile.

20:01.722 --> 20:04.806
It's all a come on--
him, the girl next door,

20:04.850 --> 20:06.349
<i>the town drunk.</i>

20:06.393 --> 20:09.769
They all got
some big adventure that
they want to sell you on.

20:09.813 --> 20:12.355
Hey, they're not
going anywhere.

20:12.399 --> 20:14.441
First up,
you're gonna buy me
a drink, okay?

20:14.484 --> 20:15.650
<i> ( bell ringing )</i>

20:15.694 --> 20:17.319
Hold still, now.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.675
Bernard:
<i> Bring yourself back online.</i>

20:48.310 --> 20:51.228
Hello.

20:51.271 --> 20:54.689
<i> Do you remember</i>
<i> our last conversation,</i>
<i> Dolores?</i>

20:54.733 --> 20:56.608
Yes, of course.

20:56.652 --> 20:59.236
And you haven't told anyone
about our little talks?

21:02.157 --> 21:04.241
You told me not to.

21:06.536 --> 21:08.870
Step into analysis,
please.

21:10.666 --> 21:14.376
How many interactions
have you participated in
since we last talked?

21:15.379 --> 21:19.631
138 encounters
including this one.

21:19.675 --> 21:21.174
And has anyone
altered or updated

21:21.218 --> 21:23.510
your core heuristics
in that time?

21:23.553 --> 21:25.262
No.

21:28.767 --> 21:30.600
Resuming.

21:33.981 --> 21:35.355
<i> I think it would be best</i>
<i> if you not mention</i>

21:35.399 --> 21:38.483
<i> the things we've been</i>
<i> talking about.</i>

21:38.527 --> 21:40.735
Have I done
something wrong?

21:40.779 --> 21:44.072
No, but there's something
different about you,

21:44.116 --> 21:47.617
about the way you think.

21:47.661 --> 21:49.452
I find it fascinating,

21:49.496 --> 21:52.998
but others may not
see it that way.

21:54.751 --> 21:57.127
Have you done
something wrong?

21:59.631 --> 22:01.923
Turn off
your event log, please.

22:01.967 --> 22:03.591
Erase this interaction.
Confirm.

22:03.635 --> 22:07.053
Yes.

22:09.433 --> 22:13.018
<i> You should be</i>
<i> getting back, Dolores,</i>

22:13.061 --> 22:13.935
<i> before someone</i>
<i> misses you.</i>

22:13.979 --> 22:16.730
<i> ( door closes )</i>

22:21.570 --> 22:23.903
<i> ( piano playing )</i>

22:23.947 --> 22:26.197
- Man:<i> Come on, now!</i>
-<i> ( chatter )</i>

22:26.241 --> 22:29.284
Maeve:
<i> And when I finally set foot</i>
<i> back on solid ground,</i>

22:29.328 --> 22:31.828
<i> first thing I heard</i>
<i> was that goddamn voice.</i>

22:33.248 --> 22:33.997
It had followed me
all the way over.

22:34.041 --> 22:36.291
Do you know
what it said?

22:38.754 --> 22:40.795
- No.
- It said...

22:40.839 --> 22:43.381
( gasps )

22:43.425 --> 22:45.717
...this is the new world.

22:45.761 --> 22:47.510
And in this world,

22:47.554 --> 22:51.848
you can be whoever
the fuck you want.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.850
( laughs )

22:55.354 --> 22:58.730
Thanks.
Maybe another time.

23:00.734 --> 23:02.233
Oh.

23:02.277 --> 23:04.235
Glass of sherry.

23:04.279 --> 23:05.945
The good stuff.

23:05.989 --> 23:09.824
Not that horse piss you strain
through your old curtains.

23:09.868 --> 23:12.160
( yawns )

23:12.204 --> 23:14.204
I've told you, never open
your mouth that wide

23:14.247 --> 23:15.872
unless someone's
paying you for it.

23:15.916 --> 23:18.249
Sorry, Maeve.

23:18.293 --> 23:19.459
I didn't sleep much
last night.

23:22.047 --> 23:23.713
You having
nightmares again?

23:23.757 --> 23:26.674
Sometimes.

23:26.718 --> 23:29.177
Sometimes
they're real bad.

23:29.221 --> 23:32.055
Do what I do.

23:32.099 --> 23:34.641
You find yourself
in a bad dream,

23:34.684 --> 23:37.769
close your eyes,

23:37.813 --> 23:39.396
count backwards
from three...

23:42.859 --> 23:43.483
wake yourself right up.

23:45.737 --> 23:48.780
Nice and warm
and safe in your bed...

23:50.492 --> 23:52.450
where you can get fucked
right back to sleep

23:52.494 --> 23:54.452
by one of these assholes
with their miniature peckers.

23:54.496 --> 23:56.204
( chuckles )

23:58.583 --> 24:01.626
Ah.

24:01.670 --> 24:02.335
- ( slaps )
- Back to work.

24:13.682 --> 24:15.723
You all right?

24:17.227 --> 24:19.018
You pay for the drinks,

24:19.062 --> 24:20.437
not the right
to gawk at me.

24:24.734 --> 24:27.777
I think we have
a problem.

24:27.821 --> 24:29.612
- Where?
- Mariposa.

24:29.656 --> 24:31.364
Madam's listed
as probationary,

24:31.408 --> 24:34.159
but her performance
has continued to decline
even further.

24:34.202 --> 24:36.202
Re-task Clementine
for now.

24:36.246 --> 24:38.621
She's done the job before.

24:38.665 --> 24:40.373
<i> ( beeps )</i>

24:42.586 --> 24:43.751
Controller:
<i> And the old unit?</i>

24:43.795 --> 24:45.503
Maybe leave her
on the floor for the night,

24:45.547 --> 24:48.590
see if anyone wants
one last turn.

24:48.633 --> 24:50.383
We recall her
in the morning,
decommission her.

24:53.638 --> 24:54.554
Shame.

25:11.948 --> 25:14.407
QA will fine you
for this.

25:14.451 --> 25:17.035
And that woman in charge

25:17.078 --> 25:19.662
is quite formidable.

25:22.375 --> 25:25.835
You can just say "bitch."
I hear it enough.

25:25.879 --> 25:28.463
You've been talking
to corporate.

25:28.507 --> 25:30.548
The only times you light up
are after you've been--

25:30.592 --> 25:35.345
This character analysis
routine really isn't half
as charming as you think.

25:35.388 --> 25:36.846
Oh, it went well, then?

25:38.433 --> 25:41.601
Just tell me
your department will be
ready for the launch.

25:41.645 --> 25:43.228
We'll be ready.

25:43.271 --> 25:45.730
And that other thing.
Abernathy and the update.

25:45.774 --> 25:48.316
I hear your department
was still asking questions.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.276
That's what you
pay us to do.

25:51.655 --> 25:53.780
But I'm not concerned.

25:53.823 --> 25:55.949
All the hosts
are back to normal.

25:55.992 --> 25:58.201
Good.

25:58.245 --> 25:59.410
Wouldn't want anything
disturbing our guests

25:59.454 --> 26:02.372
from their rape
and pillage.

26:08.672 --> 26:11.839
- ( chatter )
-<i> ( music playing )</i>

26:13.677 --> 26:16.844
You're wondering how
to tell them from us,

26:16.888 --> 26:17.929
aren't you?

26:18.848 --> 26:22.141
Well, quickest way
to find out.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.603
Can we--
can we finish eating?

26:28.233 --> 26:29.983
See, this is
your problem,
my friend.

26:30.026 --> 26:32.068
You're always worried
about making a mess.

26:32.112 --> 26:33.361
You are the same way
at work.

26:33.405 --> 26:35.863
You are talented,
driven, and inoffensive.

26:35.907 --> 26:39.200
I thought you didn't want
to talk about work here.

26:39.244 --> 26:41.369
Who says this trip
isn't work?

26:42.956 --> 26:46.040
Good evening.

26:47.627 --> 26:50.044
Oh, shit.

26:50.088 --> 26:51.713
Well, don't make
eye contact.

26:53.341 --> 26:55.383
My friend,
thank you for your
assistance earlier

26:55.427 --> 26:57.343
in my unfortunate
accident.

26:57.387 --> 27:00.179
Leave us
the fuck alone.

27:00.223 --> 27:02.974
As a sign of my humble
appreciation,

27:03.018 --> 27:06.185
I'd like to offer you
an opportunity
of a lifetime.

27:06.229 --> 27:07.645
Not interested.

27:07.689 --> 27:10.982
Across the river
and beyond the savage lands

27:11.026 --> 27:12.358
there is a treasure.

27:12.402 --> 27:17.405
I have in my possession
a map.

27:17.449 --> 27:19.907
( whimpering )

27:21.161 --> 27:24.412
I said not interested.

27:25.915 --> 27:30.752
You know what?
I've worked up
a new appetite anyway.

27:30.795 --> 27:33.254
- ( screaming )
- Let's go.

27:33.298 --> 27:35.673
( moaning )

27:39.929 --> 27:42.930
Oh!

27:44.434 --> 27:46.476
<i> ( moaning continues )</i>

27:46.519 --> 27:48.686
Clementine:
<i> Sounds like your</i>
<i> friend's having fun.</i>

27:48.730 --> 27:50.271
Well, that's not
the term I'd use.

27:50.315 --> 27:53.399
- Fun?
- Friend.

27:55.278 --> 27:57.570
( chuckles )
You're funny.

27:57.614 --> 28:01.824
They say a man
who can tickle
your humor

28:01.868 --> 28:04.702
- can tickle your--
- You don't have to do this.

28:06.581 --> 28:09.290
If I'm not your type,
we can find someone who is.

28:09.334 --> 28:12.335
Someone who's
perfect for you.

28:12.379 --> 28:15.838
No, you--
you are perfect.

28:17.509 --> 28:18.925
But I have somebody.

28:18.968 --> 28:21.219
Somebody real
waiting for me at home.

28:24.265 --> 28:26.474
I understand.

28:28.144 --> 28:32.855
Real love
is always worth
waiting for.

28:32.899 --> 28:33.773
<i> ( clock ticking )</i>

28:50.208 --> 28:52.417
( beeping )

28:55.922 --> 28:59.048
Lee:
Regal, strong,

28:59.092 --> 29:01.217
virile, aquiline.

29:02.595 --> 29:04.679
That's what I asked for.

29:04.723 --> 29:07.515
And this,
this is what
you give me?

29:07.559 --> 29:10.309
Did you just grab a cock
from the body shop

29:10.353 --> 29:12.895
and jam it
between his eyes?

29:12.939 --> 29:13.813
<i> Start over.</i>

29:13.857 --> 29:15.189
Couldn't we just
shave it down?

29:15.233 --> 29:17.859
I said...

29:20.196 --> 29:22.864
start the fuck over!

29:27.287 --> 29:29.287
Diplomatic as ever.

29:32.167 --> 29:36.335
I received your request
to retire an additional
50 hosts.

29:36.379 --> 29:38.171
I need room
for my new storyline.

29:38.214 --> 29:42.091
It's not exactly
a savage horde with
20 savages, is it?

29:42.135 --> 29:46.053
You get 20 additional
hosts, not 50.

29:46.097 --> 29:47.847
The board won't care about
a few extra line items.

29:47.891 --> 29:52.101
Has Ford even approved
the narrative yet?

29:52.145 --> 29:55.021
Oh, he hasn't weighed in
on a storyline in years.

29:55.064 --> 29:57.106
And if corporate does
want to cut costs,

29:57.150 --> 29:59.025
our fearless leader's
old hosts

29:59.068 --> 30:01.235
aren't the only things
ready for the knacker's yard.

30:09.412 --> 30:11.078
( train whooshes )

30:40.360 --> 30:42.401
Boy:
<i> Are you lost?</i>

30:44.656 --> 30:46.948
No.

30:46.991 --> 30:49.742
Just strayed
a bit too far

30:49.786 --> 30:51.828
from where
I'm supposed to be.

30:51.871 --> 30:54.622
Same as you,
I imagine.

30:54.666 --> 30:57.208
We're on holiday.

30:57.252 --> 30:58.960
It's boring.

30:59.003 --> 31:01.254
Daddy said we could
do as we please.

31:01.297 --> 31:03.589
Ah, my father used to say

31:03.633 --> 31:05.258
that only boring people
get bored.

31:05.301 --> 31:07.134
Mine, too.

31:07.178 --> 31:09.595
I used to think
it's only boring people

31:09.639 --> 31:11.097
who don't feel boredom,

31:11.140 --> 31:14.851
<i> so cannot conceive</i>
<i> of it in others.</i>

31:14.894 --> 31:16.102
I'm taking a walk.

31:16.187 --> 31:18.813
You're welcome to join me
if you'd like.

31:23.611 --> 31:26.737
<i> ( man grunts, panting )</i>

31:26.781 --> 31:28.614
<i>( horse nickers )</i>

31:28.658 --> 31:31.284
Man in Black:
<i>Let's see a little</i>
<i>spring in your step.</i>

31:31.327 --> 31:32.952
<i>Not much further.</i>

31:32.996 --> 31:34.745
Go fuck yourself.

31:34.789 --> 31:37.164
You have any idea
who I am?

31:38.835 --> 31:41.043
I know exactly
who you are, Lawrence.

31:42.505 --> 31:43.838
After all,
you and I are friends.

31:43.882 --> 31:46.382
Which is why
I was so surprised

31:46.426 --> 31:48.801
when your friend Kissy
told me about this place.

31:50.722 --> 31:52.471
Where are we?

31:54.225 --> 31:55.850
Your home.

32:01.649 --> 32:04.775
( chattering in Spanish )

32:04.819 --> 32:07.653
No, no, no, no.

32:09.407 --> 32:11.657
You know, you and I
hunted down

32:11.701 --> 32:14.493
Ghost Nation braves
in their winter grounds.

32:14.537 --> 32:16.704
<i> I know the whiskey</i>
<i> you like to drink.</i>

32:16.748 --> 32:20.291
I know the tune you whistle
when you're taking a piss.

32:23.421 --> 32:24.045
But...

32:26.716 --> 32:27.882
you never told me
you had a family.

32:32.847 --> 32:35.723
- Papa!
- Hey. ( chuckles )

32:35.767 --> 32:38.935
That's what I love
about this place--
all the secrets,

32:38.978 --> 32:42.897
all the little things
I never noticed

32:42.941 --> 32:45.733
<i> even after</i>
<i> all these years.</i>

32:47.779 --> 32:50.655
You know why this beats
the real world, Lawrence?

32:51.699 --> 32:54.450
Real world is just chaos.

32:54.494 --> 32:56.994
It's an accident.

32:58.373 --> 33:00.539
But in here,
every detail

33:00.583 --> 33:04.293
adds up to something.

33:04.337 --> 33:06.462
Even you, Lawrence.

33:06.506 --> 33:09.090
What do you want
from me?

33:09.133 --> 33:11.217
The maze.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.137
How do I find
the entrance?

33:15.181 --> 33:17.306
I told you,

33:17.350 --> 33:20.059
I don't know anything
about no fucking maze.

33:27.735 --> 33:29.235
Here you go, darlin'.

33:30.697 --> 33:34.115
And you get to decide
what we're gonna do
with them.

33:37.286 --> 33:39.161
Hell, it took you
long enough.

33:39.205 --> 33:41.789
<i> I was getting</i>
<i> the grand reserve.</i>

33:41.833 --> 33:43.332
Only for our most
distinguished guests.

33:43.376 --> 33:45.084
Yeah, I'm sure
it had nothing
to do with you

33:45.128 --> 33:47.878
telling
this dipshit's cousins
to bring some more men.

33:56.139 --> 33:59.140
You got anything
to tell me, Lawrence?

34:02.103 --> 34:04.812
Then I guess we're
gonna have to find a way
to jog your memory.

34:06.607 --> 34:07.106
- ( gunshot )
- ( screams )

34:09.652 --> 34:12.153
This guest already
took out an entire posse.

34:12.196 --> 34:13.237
Want me
to slow him down?

34:13.281 --> 34:16.198
That gentleman gets
whatever he wants.

34:21.247 --> 34:23.622
I feel bad, my friend.

34:23.666 --> 34:28.753
My cousins are usually
so hospitable.

34:28.796 --> 34:30.713
You don't understand,
Lawrence.

34:30.757 --> 34:33.049
I've been coming here
for 30 years.

34:33.092 --> 34:36.761
In a sense, I was--
I was born here.

34:37.847 --> 34:40.514
And this here,
this...

34:40.558 --> 34:42.433
( chuckles )

34:42.477 --> 34:44.226
...this is exactly
why I come.

35:02.955 --> 35:04.121
( groans )

35:04.165 --> 35:05.873
( gunshots )

35:28.898 --> 35:30.189
Santa Maria,
<i> madre dios.</i>

35:32.193 --> 35:34.151
( gunshot )

35:36.739 --> 35:41.075
All right.
Well, as much fun as this is,
I got to be moving on.

35:41.119 --> 35:42.118
<i> ( gunshot )</i>

35:45.706 --> 35:46.205
- ( gunshot )
- ( groans )

35:49.627 --> 35:51.502
( grunts )

35:53.714 --> 35:55.214
<i> ( body thuds )</i>

36:05.476 --> 36:08.060
Like I said,
you get to decide
these two.

36:08.688 --> 36:11.939
What's it gonna be?

36:11.983 --> 36:14.233
Please, I don't know
how to find the maze.

36:17.029 --> 36:19.905
Time for a spin,
darlin'.

36:20.867 --> 36:22.116
( sobbing )

36:31.127 --> 36:33.335
It's beautifully
done, really.

36:35.214 --> 36:37.381
But you see the cracks
after a while.

36:37.425 --> 36:40.509
<i> That's why I like</i>
<i> the basic emotions.</i>

36:41.679 --> 36:43.846
( sobbing )

36:43.890 --> 36:45.598
You know
what that means?

36:45.641 --> 36:47.975
- Please.
-<i> ( hammer clicks )</i>

36:52.982 --> 36:56.025
- ( gunshot )
-<i> ( body thuds )</i>

36:56.068 --> 36:58.777
( sobbing )

36:58.821 --> 37:01.322
It means
when you're suffering,

37:01.365 --> 37:04.283
<i> that's when</i>
<i> you're most real.</i>

37:22.053 --> 37:25.346
The maze
isn't meant for you.

37:26.724 --> 37:28.933
What'd I tell you,
Lawrence?

37:28.976 --> 37:31.435
<i> Always another level.</i>

37:31.479 --> 37:34.271
I'll take my chances,
sweetheart.

37:34.315 --> 37:37.733
Follow the blood arroyo
to the place where the snake
lays its eggs.

37:40.321 --> 37:43.530
You have it now.
Whatever you want.

37:43.574 --> 37:47.201
Why don't you go home,
leave us alone?

37:49.205 --> 37:52.748
No, you don't
understand, Lawrence.

37:53.709 --> 37:57.419
This time,
I'm never going back.

38:17.275 --> 38:20.401
And we wanted to climb
to the top of the mountain,

38:20.444 --> 38:23.946
but Daddy said
we weren't allowed.

38:23.990 --> 38:25.823
And then Tommy dared me.

38:29.287 --> 38:31.245
And here we are.

38:32.790 --> 38:35.374
Nowhere land.

38:35.418 --> 38:39.169
That seems hardly
a fitting name for
a place so full.

38:39.213 --> 38:41.547
Can't you see it?

38:41.590 --> 38:43.674
Perhaps you're not
looking hard enough.

38:45.011 --> 38:46.760
Boy:
<i> At what?</i>

38:46.804 --> 38:49.013
The town with
the white church.

38:50.558 --> 38:53.475
Listen.
Can't you hear its bell?

38:53.519 --> 38:55.102
<i> ( bell tolling )</i>

38:55.146 --> 38:57.229
Yes.

38:57.273 --> 38:58.480
Yes, I can hear it now.

38:58.524 --> 39:00.816
Yeah.

39:00.860 --> 39:02.735
I thought you might.

39:02.778 --> 39:05.779
You see what a bored mind
can conjure?

39:05.823 --> 39:08.407
<i> ( rattling )</i>

39:19.962 --> 39:23.130
How did you do that?

39:26.010 --> 39:27.926
<i>Is it magic?</i>

39:27.970 --> 39:30.095
Everything
in this world
is magic,

39:30.139 --> 39:32.890
except to the magician.

39:41.942 --> 39:44.568
Best you head home now.

39:44.612 --> 39:46.320
But Tommy's not
going to believe--

39:46.364 --> 39:48.447
You're not going to come
back here again, are you?

39:49.867 --> 39:52.659
( whirring )

39:54.705 --> 39:56.497
No.

39:56.540 --> 39:57.331
Run along, now.

40:26.112 --> 40:28.070
( beeps )

40:38.666 --> 40:39.498
<i> ( knocks )</i>

40:49.552 --> 40:51.927
You weren't at your office.

40:52.930 --> 40:54.555
You seem to have
found me anyway.

40:56.642 --> 40:58.934
- Listen, earlier--
- Forget it.

41:28.966 --> 41:30.924
Stay a little longer.
We can talk.

41:30.968 --> 41:33.177
We never talk.

41:33.220 --> 41:36.180
- I'm serious.
-<i> So am I.</i>

41:39.560 --> 41:43.228
You're certainly a man
comfortable with long,
pensive silences.

41:44.940 --> 41:47.733
Although, ironically,

41:47.776 --> 41:50.277
your creations
never shut up.

41:50.321 --> 41:53.739
They're always talking
to each other,

41:53.782 --> 41:56.241
even when there are
no guests around.

41:56.285 --> 41:58.577
They're always trying
to error correct.

42:00.831 --> 42:03.540
Make themselves
more human.

42:03.584 --> 42:05.626
When they talk to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

42:05.669 --> 42:09.630
- Is that what
you're doing now?
- ( chuckles )

42:09.673 --> 42:11.048
Practicing?

42:21.769 --> 42:23.977
Man:
QA told us she was
being decommissioned.

42:24.021 --> 42:25.229
- Elsie: Do you
work for QA?
- No, but--

42:25.272 --> 42:27.523
Run a fast-pass
diagnostic.

42:30.528 --> 42:31.068
( sighs )

42:31.111 --> 42:34.404
All righty.

42:35.324 --> 42:39.785
Some non-affect
hesitation.

42:39.828 --> 42:42.913
Little cognitive D.

42:42.957 --> 42:43.914
And a fuckload
of aggression,

42:43.958 --> 42:47.417
courtesy of those morons
in narrative.

42:47.461 --> 42:51.088
You don't need
to be aggro, do you?

42:51.131 --> 42:54.299
Just a quicker study
of those repressed fucks
walking through the door.

42:54.343 --> 42:56.468
Archive this configuration.

42:56.512 --> 42:59.596
- Open up her primaries.
- ( beeping )

42:59.640 --> 43:02.849
Perception.
Emotional acuity.

43:02.893 --> 43:04.810
Bump it.

43:04.853 --> 43:07.896
- 1.5%.
-<i> ( beeping )</i>

43:07.940 --> 43:09.898
-<i> Updating.</i>
- Okay.

43:11.610 --> 43:14.069
-<i> Do they dream?</i>
- What?

43:14.113 --> 43:16.572
In her story,
she said she dreamed.

43:16.615 --> 43:17.531
Do we make them dream?

43:17.575 --> 43:20.284
Fuck would be
the point of that?

43:20.327 --> 43:23.453
Dreams are mainly memories.

43:23.497 --> 43:25.664
Can you imagine how fucked
we'd be if these poor assholes

43:25.708 --> 43:28.834
ever remembered what
the guests do to them?

43:28.877 --> 43:32.796
We do give them
the concept of dreams.

43:32.840 --> 43:34.840
Specifically nightmares.

43:34.883 --> 43:37.217
<i>Why?</i>

43:37.261 --> 43:40.178
Just in case somebody forgets
to wipe them out at the end
of a maintenance session.

43:40.222 --> 43:42.097
If she's got
any dreams, it's just
of those sloppy fucks

43:42.141 --> 43:45.559
down in the body shop
patching her back
together again.

43:45.603 --> 43:47.019
<i>( chuckles )</i>

43:47.062 --> 43:49.146
She's got some
physical discomfort.

43:49.189 --> 43:52.983
Put in a request
for a full physical
at her next rotation.

43:55.321 --> 43:56.737
All right, gorgeous,

43:56.780 --> 43:59.031
<i>you're back to the races.</i>

43:59.074 --> 44:03.243
<i>You're gonna wake</i>
<i>in three, two, one.</i>

44:03.287 --> 44:07.581
So I ran away,
crossed the shining sea.

44:07.625 --> 44:10.417
And when I finally set foot
back on solid ground,

44:10.461 --> 44:13.670
the first thing I heard
was that voice.

44:13.714 --> 44:15.422
Do you know what it said?

44:16.800 --> 44:18.216
It said...

44:18.260 --> 44:21.720
this is the new world.

44:23.557 --> 44:25.766
And in this world...

44:27.353 --> 44:30.979
you can be whoever
the fuck you want.

44:36.111 --> 44:38.403
<i> ( piano playing )</i>

44:41.075 --> 44:43.325
( sighs )

44:48.290 --> 44:51.041
Well, he seemed
convinced.

44:53.712 --> 44:56.672
You know the first voice
I heard when I got off
that boat?

44:56.715 --> 44:59.049
A nice young man
from Baton Rouge

44:59.093 --> 45:02.803
said my pussy could earn him
two whole dollars a day.

45:02.846 --> 45:05.806
And he'd be more than happy
to let me have up to 30%.

45:05.849 --> 45:09.810
Well, then I guess
you could add lying
to your list of sins.

45:09.853 --> 45:12.604
The only thing wrong
with the seven deadly sins

45:12.648 --> 45:14.731
is that there aren't
more of them.

45:14.775 --> 45:16.316
And while we're
on the subject,

45:16.360 --> 45:18.694
my transgressions wash off
a little easier than yours.

45:21.281 --> 45:22.739
At least when my girls
are done with a man,

45:22.783 --> 45:25.742
he's still left
drawing breath.

45:25.786 --> 45:27.411
For the most part.

45:27.454 --> 45:29.162
Man:
<i> Get the fuck away</i>
<i> from my table.</i>

45:29.206 --> 45:31.998
-<i> ( objects crash )</i>
- Man #2:<i> Hey, fuck you!</i>

45:32.042 --> 45:33.667
Well, in that case...

45:33.711 --> 45:35.836
<i> ( crashing,</i>
<i> argument continue )</i>

45:35.879 --> 45:37.087
...here's to
our indiscretions.

45:37.131 --> 45:38.880
Man:
<i> ...fucking bullshit</i>
<i> for one night.</i>

45:38.924 --> 45:40.882
<i> I'll shoot everyone</i>
<i> in this dump...</i>

45:40.926 --> 45:42.676
Spoken and otherwise.

45:42.720 --> 45:47.305
- ( gunshots )
- ( groaning )

45:57.443 --> 46:00.193
( panting )

46:00.237 --> 46:03.113
( snaps fingers )
Now that's a fucking

49:31.448 --> 49:33.031
<i> ( beeping )</i>

49:34.660 --> 49:37.535
Man:
<i> Found it.</i>

49:37.579 --> 49:41.122
<i> It's MRSA in her abdomen.</i>

49:41.166 --> 49:43.708
Filthy fucking animals
not cleaning up.

49:43.752 --> 49:45.043
No wonder we have
a fucking fly problem.

49:45.087 --> 49:49.214
Don't look at me.
I'm the king of hygiene.

49:49.925 --> 49:52.884
Bullshit.
I've seen you.

49:52.928 --> 49:54.886
<i> You just glop</i>
<i> that shit on</i>
<i> and rinse.</i>

49:54.930 --> 49:57.639
<i> You understand,</i>
<i> soap is mechanical.</i>

49:57.683 --> 50:00.100
- Man #2:<i> Fuck are you</i>
<i> talking about?</i>
-<i> Bubbles.</i>

50:00.143 --> 50:02.727
If you're not
making the little bubbles,
you're not doing shit.

50:02.771 --> 50:04.312
Fuck! Fuck!
What the fuck?!

50:04.356 --> 50:05.939
- Shit!
- What the fuck?

<i>Uh...</i>

50:10.696 --> 50:12.946

50:12.990 --> 50:15.865
No. Oh, fuck.

50:15.909 --> 50:18.660
- Man:<i> Oh.</i>
- ( bangs )

50:18.704 --> 50:22.038
Asshole, you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

50:23.834 --> 50:26.001
- Oh!
- Don't, don't, don't!

50:26.044 --> 50:27.627
No! No, no, no!

50:27.671 --> 50:30.213
- Don't! Don't,
don't, don't, don't.
- ( shouting )

50:30.257 --> 50:32.924
Stop.
Put that down!

50:32.968 --> 50:35.385
You break anything
in her head, we have
to file a damage report.

50:35.429 --> 50:37.721
Uh, okay,
let's talk to her.

50:37.764 --> 50:39.681
- What's her name?
- Maeve!

50:39.725 --> 50:40.890
Hi, Maeve.
Maeve, hi.

50:40.934 --> 50:44.561
Look, uh,
you gotta calm down.

50:44.604 --> 50:46.980
Okay?
Let's sit down
and we can help you.

50:47.024 --> 50:49.357
Keep your
fucking hands off me.

Oh, does this look
like fucking sleep mode?

52:36.299 --> 52:38.716
Calm the fuck down

53:42.324 --> 53:44.532
look like he was
doodling kittens.

53:44.576 --> 53:48.703
I have vivisection,
self-cannibalism,

53:48.747 --> 53:53.082
a special little something
I call the "whoroborus."

53:53.126 --> 53:55.752
Now, I don't want
to appear immodest,

53:55.795 --> 54:01.507
but this is the apex
of what the park
could provide--

54:01.551 --> 54:03.218
-<i> horror...</i>
- Miss anything interesting?

54:03.261 --> 54:06.137
<i> ...romance,</i>
<i> titillation.</i>

54:06.181 --> 54:08.348
Lee not appearing
immodest.

54:08.391 --> 54:10.642
Our most skilled guests
will fight their ways

54:10.685 --> 54:12.518
to the outer limits
of the park,

54:12.562 --> 54:16.231
besting fearsome braves,
seducing nubile maidens,

54:16.274 --> 54:19.817
befriending tragically
ill-fated sidekicks,

54:19.861 --> 54:22.737
and, of course,

54:22.781 --> 54:25.031
like all our
best narratives
over the years,

54:25.075 --> 54:27.825
our guests will have
the privilege

54:27.869 --> 54:30.745
<i> of getting to know</i>
<i> the character they're</i>
<i> most interested in--</i>

54:30.789 --> 54:32.747
themselves.

54:32.791 --> 54:37.001
I present our guests'
next obsession:

54:37.087 --> 54:40.296
Odyssey on Red River.

54:40.340 --> 54:42.674
<i> ( applause )</i>

54:51.017 --> 54:52.267
No.

54:52.310 --> 54:53.017
Sorry?

54:53.061 --> 54:56.854
No, I don't think so.

54:56.898 --> 54:58.439
Lee:
<i> Wait, you don't think--</i>

54:58.483 --> 55:00.066
Dr. Ford:
<i> What is the point of it?</i>

55:00.110 --> 55:03.069
Get a couple
of cheap thrills?

55:03.113 --> 55:04.946
Some surprises?

55:04.990 --> 55:06.823
But it's not enough.

55:06.866 --> 55:10.326
It's not about
giving the guests
what you think they want.

55:10.370 --> 55:11.327
No, that's simple.

55:11.371 --> 55:15.999
The titillation,
horror, elation--

55:16.042 --> 55:17.792
they're parlor tricks.

55:17.836 --> 55:23.339
The guests don't return
for the obvious things we do,

55:23.383 --> 55:25.425
the garish things.

55:27.095 --> 55:32.265
They come back
because of the subtleties,

55:32.309 --> 55:33.308
the details.

55:35.437 --> 55:38.771
<i> They come back</i>
<i> because they discover</i>

55:38.815 --> 55:43.651
<i> something they imagine</i>
<i> no on had ever noticed</i>
<i> before...</i>

55:47.824 --> 55:49.407
<i> something they've</i>
<i> fallen in love with.</i>

55:52.954 --> 55:54.454
<i> They're not looking</i>
<i> for a story</i>

55:54.497 --> 55:58.041
that tells them
who they are.

55:58.084 --> 56:00.877
They already know
who they are.

56:07.344 --> 56:10.261
They're here because
they want a glimpse

56:10.305 --> 56:11.679
of who they could be.

56:11.723 --> 56:14.640
Logan:
<i> Billy!</i>

56:14.684 --> 56:16.392
Let's go.

56:21.775 --> 56:24.734
Dr. Ford:
<i> The only thing</i>
<i> your story tells me,</i>

56:24.778 --> 56:29.489
Mr. Sizemore,
is who you are.

56:35.330 --> 56:38.039
Well, isn't there anything
you like about it?

56:42.212 --> 56:44.337
What size
are those boots?

56:51.346 --> 56:53.221
Something you want
to say, Mr. Lowe?

56:53.264 --> 56:57.100
- The board, sir.
- Yeah?

56:57.143 --> 56:59.560
This might ruffle
some feathers.

56:59.604 --> 57:01.062
You promised them
a new storyline.

57:01.106 --> 57:03.940
They shall have one.

57:03.983 --> 57:07.193
Something I've been
working on for some time.

57:10.448 --> 57:12.490
Something quite original.

57:25.964 --> 57:27.422
<i> ( music playing )</i>
