¶ I'm crazy ¶

00:06.040 --> 00:10.109
¶ Crazy for you... ¶

00:10.111 --> 00:13.345
¶ Make sure that you have
the best in life... ¶

00:13.347 --> 00:15.214
I think I saw a cop.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.583
¶ ...I wouldn't do ¶

00:17.585 --> 00:21.320
¶ 'Cause I'm crazy... ¶

00:21.322 --> 00:23.389
We got to hold them back.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.159
Mister, out.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.361
(gun chamber clicks)

00:29.363 --> 00:30.362
Nobody moves!

00:30.364 --> 00:34.333
(gunshot, people screaming)

00:34.335 --> 00:35.367
Come here.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.102
Come here.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.104
Stop!

00:39.106 --> 00:42.107
Don't move!

00:50.418 --> 00:52.518
Mmm.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.386
God, this is so good.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.654
(laughs)

00:55.656 --> 00:58.424
Oh, it-it is, like,
dissolving right now.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.526
It's just like melting
onto my tongue.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.261
(laughs)

01:02.263 --> 01:03.328
Here. Come here.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.730
It's all yours.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.665
Let me get this
out of your way.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.167
I...

01:08.169 --> 01:10.469
Oh, actually, I think
she's still working on it.

01:10.471 --> 01:13.405
Are you... Are you
still working on it?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.673
Well, yes.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.776
Uh, yes, I am still
working on it.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.747
You remember?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.282
Yeah.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.184
You know how much

01:25.186 --> 01:28.287
trouble I got in
letting you sit there

01:28.289 --> 01:34.326
every day for three hours
with that one cup of coffee?

01:34.328 --> 01:36.528
I was still working on it.

01:38.399 --> 01:39.698
Besides, with a...

01:39.700 --> 01:42.201
a view like you,
who wants to move?

01:44.338 --> 01:46.738
I get to look at you all night.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.775
All night.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.246
(groans softly)

01:54.248 --> 01:55.514
Are you okay?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.416
(groans)
I'm good.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.584
I'm good.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.420
Just, uh... just tingly.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.388
You know, it's...

02:03.390 --> 02:04.556
It's weird.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.595
Can I help you?

02:10.865 --> 02:13.599
I'm going to go
to the ladies'.

02:13.601 --> 02:14.900
(groans)

02:14.902 --> 02:16.401
If I'm not back in ten...

02:16.403 --> 02:18.303
I'll send in the hounds.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.522
Oh, God.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.525
This place is so beautiful.

02:39.527 --> 02:43.462
Yeah, I bet even...
the bathrooms are beautiful.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.633
Enjoy your meals.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.870
(sighs)

02:51.872 --> 02:54.239
I'm sorry about that.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.408
I'll get your bill.

02:56.410 --> 03:00.212
Hmm. No dessert menu?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.216
Hey, hey, um,

03:04.218 --> 03:07.186
Team 5 is still
on that motel standoff.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.388
You guys mind sticking around
till they get back?

03:09.390 --> 03:10.656
Yeah. No problem.

03:10.658 --> 03:11.890
Guys, you copy that?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.325
Copy.
Copy that.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.260
Copy that.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.563
Shelly, I'm gonna
be late tonight.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.631
Let me say good night
to the girls.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.834
Soph, yeah.
Yeah, a little bit OT.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.303
Yeah.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.604
All right, save me some.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.639
Hey.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.374
I'm good. Thanks.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.543
Yeah, we have to postpone
tonight.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.611
(laughs)

03:32.613 --> 03:34.213
I'm sorry.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.380
(phone ringing)

03:35.382 --> 03:36.548
Hello?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.683
SPIKE:
Hey, Lou. Sorry, bud.

03:37.685 --> 03:40.285
I might be a little
held up at work.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.453
Oh, it's okay.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.421
At least you called.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.755
Oh.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.624
I have to...

03:45.626 --> 03:48.694
Yeah, I have to...
go this way.

03:48.696 --> 03:49.861
This is the door.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.430
WOMAN:
Miss? Are you okay, Miss?

03:51.432 --> 03:54.433
Well, I have to go...
I have to go out.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.634
I want to go home.

03:56.604 --> 03:59.605
Your friend needs help
in the bathroom.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.506
After that, you pay

04:01.508 --> 04:02.941
and leave.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.309
Don't tell Mom.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.778
Don't tell Mom.
I have to go this way.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.814
I-I... I have
to get out of here.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.515
I have to go home.
Laura?

04:10.517 --> 04:12.517
I have to go...
Laura.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.853
(sighs)

04:14.855 --> 04:16.622
It's okay, baby.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.423
Come here.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.460
I'm sorry.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.696
(laughs)

04:26.367 --> 04:27.599
It's okay.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.602
Hey, do you still need
to use the bathroom,

04:30.604 --> 04:31.737
or are you done?

04:31.739 --> 04:34.806
No. I'm... I'm good.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.875
Okay.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.646
You know what?

04:40.648 --> 04:41.880
Let's just go.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.715
What? Without paying?

04:43.717 --> 04:46.618
What, you mean, after
they were so nice to us?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.687
(laughs)

04:49.823 --> 04:51.990
This bad boy side of you--

04:51.992 --> 04:53.992
I kind of like it...

04:53.994 --> 04:56.428
Well, night's
still young.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.397
You ain't seen
nothing yet.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.564
(laughs)

04:59.566 --> 05:00.565
Next?

05:00.567 --> 05:01.733
Next.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.602
Let's go.
(laughs)

05:15.949 --> 05:17.916
What's left on
the credit card?

05:17.918 --> 05:19.985
Not that much.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.754
The guy's gone and
doubled the price.

05:22.756 --> 05:26.091
Oh. Maybe we could look
at another one.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.559
No.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.627
You kidding?

05:28.629 --> 05:29.961
No. That's not the point.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.763
Well, I don't
know. I mean...

05:31.765 --> 05:33.832
Lau, listen.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.403
I made you a promise,
and I'm keeping it.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.979
Well, I guess he shouldn't
have boosted the price.

05:47.981 --> 05:51.383
No, he shouldn't have
boosted the price.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.452
Especially today.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.823
Why don't you go talk to him?

06:00.027 --> 06:02.361
(clears throat)

06:07.134 --> 06:09.134
Hi.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.136
Excuse me.

06:11.138 --> 06:14.539
I'm looking to buy a watch.

06:15.909 --> 06:19.044
LAURA:
Can you show me what
you have with the...?

06:19.046 --> 06:22.514
(laughs)
I just, like, forgot what
they call them. The, uh...

06:22.516 --> 06:23.749
The...

06:23.751 --> 06:25.751
Roman numerals.
From Roman numerals.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.620
Um, something...

06:28.622 --> 06:30.622
not too flashy.

06:30.624 --> 06:34.493
Um... maybe I...

06:34.495 --> 06:35.827
Can I see this
one? This one?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.963
What is that? What is that?
Is that mother-of-pearl?

06:37.965 --> 06:39.631
What's your price range?

06:41.602 --> 06:42.167
LAURA:
Well,

06:42.169 --> 06:43.435
we're in the, uh...

06:43.437 --> 06:45.971
MAN:
Hey! Stop!

06:45.973 --> 06:47.672
Don't move!

06:47.674 --> 06:49.841
Don't... move!

06:52.146 --> 06:53.011
Call 911.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.713
MAN:
Sir?

06:55.649 --> 06:57.682
(panting)

06:57.684 --> 06:58.984
Sir, please put down that gun.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.552
MAN:
No, not
this time.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.654
Not this time.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.790
This is the fourth time
this month,

07:04.792 --> 07:06.558
and I am not taking it.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.628
WOMAN:
This is 2110 Church Street.
We're being robbed.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.429
(screams)

07:10.431 --> 07:11.663
(whimpers and cries)

07:11.665 --> 07:14.633
(whimpering)

07:14.635 --> 07:17.035
Put it down.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.037
(woman sobbing)
I said,

07:19.039 --> 07:20.639
put the gun down!

07:20.641 --> 07:21.807
Do...
Let her go.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.442
...what he says.
Let her go!

07:23.444 --> 07:25.644
(sobbing)

07:25.646 --> 07:27.012
Don't make me do this.

07:27.014 --> 07:30.482
Let her go.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.184
I don't want to hurt your wife.

07:32.186 --> 07:33.685
They want money.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.820
Just give it to them!

07:37.691 --> 07:39.224
Hey, we're short on time here.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.693
Just put the gun down
and let us go.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.930
(sobbing)

07:50.804 --> 07:52.471
Okay, son.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.506
I... put it down.

07:54.508 --> 07:55.841
Let her go.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.742
Go get the gun.

07:57.744 --> 07:58.844
Get the gun.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.479
MAN:
Let her go, son.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.813
Please, son, let her go.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.848
Please, son.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.483
Please, son,
let her go. Please?

08:04.485 --> 08:05.650
Oh!

08:05.652 --> 08:06.818
(crying)

08:09.523 --> 08:12.824
You know, you're
short on time, too.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.794
What are you gonna do
with what you got left?

Laura?

Inspector...

09:35.809 --> 09:37.008
what have you got?

09:37.010 --> 09:39.344
Suspects fled
in a gold sedan. They got

09:39.346 --> 09:41.947
a .357 Mag,
and we just put out an APB.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.615
Gun's theirs?

09:43.617 --> 09:44.916
No. It's the shopkeeper's.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.585
.357. People
these days.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.154
Well, they said they were robbed
three times the last month.

09:49.156 --> 09:52.324
Okay. Okay, guys,
subjects have fled the scene,

09:52.326 --> 09:53.758
and they are armed.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.660
We need you to stay on the road.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.362
We got an APB on a gold sedan.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.297
Repeat: APB on a gold sedan.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.999
Copy that.
ED:
They're close.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.768
We may be looking
at a moving takedown.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.704
You got an ID?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.372
No. There's no camera
in the shop.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.107
Okay. Eddie, see
what you can get

10:09.109 --> 10:11.109
out of Mr. and Mrs. .357,
will you?

10:11.111 --> 10:13.178
(phone ringing)

10:14.114 --> 10:16.014
Parker.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.782
Boss, no other calls
in the area.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.151
Just a dine-and-dash,
but it matches the description.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.721
I got a waiter on the line
if you want to talk to him.

10:22.723 --> 10:23.888
Okay. Thanks, Winnie.

10:23.890 --> 10:24.923
Putting him through.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.125
Hey, I'm Sergeant Greg Parker,

10:27.127 --> 10:28.994
I'm with the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.029
What can you tell me
about these people?

10:31.031 --> 10:32.731
They were in their
late 20s, I guess.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.550
You remember what
they were wearing?

10:34.551 --> 10:36.368
Yeah, she was in a purple
dress; he was in a blue suit.

10:36.370 --> 10:39.137
Maybe, um, 5'9", 5'10".

10:39.139 --> 10:40.205
You ask me, they were high.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.040
Can you describe
their state of mind?

10:42.042 --> 10:43.141
Like I said, crack thieves.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.409
They come in here
all the time.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.044
Yeah, how were they behaving?

10:46.046 --> 10:48.046
Yeah, they were making the
other customers uncomfortable.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.280
Can you be more specific?

10:49.282 --> 10:51.182
Intense.
Really out of it.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.118
Glassy-eyed,
knocking things over.

10:53.120 --> 10:57.188
Off-balance.
Her speech was a bit slurry.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.357
And the woman apparently
had a fit in the bathroom.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.959
Just before they left,

11:00.961 --> 11:03.228
he was going on about
being short on time.
Yeah...

11:03.230 --> 11:05.330
"What are you gonna do
with what you've got left?"

11:05.332 --> 11:08.266
What'd they take?
Art Deco ring,
five diamonds.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.669
They didn't grab anything
else on the way out?

11:10.671 --> 11:12.103
Oh, no, they knew
you guys were coming.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.705
Okay, thanks for your help.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.475
What's your take, Eddie?

11:17.476 --> 11:18.742
Looking like substance abuse.

11:18.745 --> 11:20.078
Looking like, huh?
Well, they could've

11:20.080 --> 11:21.713
cleaned out the whole place,
but they didn't.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.214
We got a foot cop said
he just saw a gold sedan

11:23.216 --> 11:25.216
going north on Yonge
above Charles.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.818
Okay.

11:26.820 --> 11:27.986
Wordy, what's your 20?

11:27.988 --> 11:29.788
We'll send you a postcard,
Inspector!

11:29.790 --> 11:31.189
All right.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.163
Maybe we should stop now.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.432
Get home.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.067
Do you see any cops?

11:42.069 --> 11:45.170
Not yet.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.938
Okay, then we're okay.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.808
Unless there were cameras
at that place.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.979
You really don't think
they can track us down?

11:54.981 --> 11:58.149
I don't want to risk
being at home if they do.

11:58.151 --> 12:02.253
But if we can't
get home, then...

12:02.255 --> 12:04.055
Then the plan changes.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.156
But we don't have the...

12:05.158 --> 12:07.325
I guess we improvise.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.861
Okay?

12:09.863 --> 12:12.964
Laura?

12:12.966 --> 12:14.432
Laura!

12:14.434 --> 12:16.835
Laura!

12:16.837 --> 12:18.269
(inhales sharply)
Hey!

12:18.271 --> 12:20.271
(groaning)
Lau, you're back.

12:20.273 --> 12:24.242
(gasping)
Breathe.
Breathe.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.177
I'm okay.

12:26.179 --> 12:29.247
You're okay.
You're fine.
I'm okay.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.315
Oh!

12:32.853 --> 12:34.452
You okay?

12:34.454 --> 12:36.921
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Are you okay, yeah?

12:36.923 --> 12:38.757
I'm okay.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.492
We got to get out of here.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.761
WOMAN:
Are you okay?

12:42.763 --> 12:45.230
MAN:
Hey, look at this!

12:45.232 --> 12:46.898
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.433
But look what you
did to my car, man!
Come on.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.068
Come on. You okay?
Look at this, man!

12:50.070 --> 12:51.503
Hey, hey!

12:51.505 --> 12:53.171
(horn honking)

12:53.173 --> 12:55.340
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?!

12:57.310 --> 12:59.444
So, what substances
you guys thinking?

12:59.446 --> 13:01.279
Could be cocaine.
Or meth.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.413
With hallucinations?

13:02.415 --> 13:04.215
JULES:
Goes with a high dose.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.667
You dress up,
you go out to dinner,

13:05.668 --> 13:07.118
and then you try
to rob a pawn shop.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.419
A fun Friday night.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.088
PARKER:
I don't know.

13:17.197 --> 13:20.131
Taxi! Taxi!

13:21.401 --> 13:23.301
(horns honking)

13:35.348 --> 13:37.182
WINNIE:
<i> Team 1, we got something.</i>

13:37.184 --> 13:40.185
Hit-and-run involving a gold
sedan, Bloor and Parliament.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.586
Subjects abandoned their vehicle

13:41.588 --> 13:44.289
and flagged an Oakwood taxi
going west on Bloor.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.224
Winnie, alert all units
in the area.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.260
Eyes open for flashing emergency
lights on an Oakwood taxi.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.197
PARKER:
No sirens,
SRU intervention only.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.533
We're considering this

13:54.534 --> 13:56.868
a mobile hostage situation
with possible drug users,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.436
and we do not want
to provoke the subjects.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.139
You got it.
No sirens, SRU only.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.341
And Winnie, let's track
the gold sedan's license plate,

14:03.343 --> 14:04.793
see who we're looking for.

14:04.794 --> 14:06.244
Or we put a call
into the Oakwood dispatch.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.346
See if we can tap
into the fleet's GPS.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.347
Track 'em down that way.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.850
These kids and their toys.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.324
Ev... Ev.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.960
My head is spinning.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.632
Ramesh, we need to go faster.

14:27.634 --> 14:31.369
I can't legally
go faster than this, sir.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.904
Ev, what are we going to do?

14:32.906 --> 14:35.540
(whispering):
Hey. No one's following us.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.343
We're okay.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.478
Nothing changes, Lau.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.580
Okay.

14:42.582 --> 14:45.383
WINNIE:
<i> We got a name. We got a name</i>
<i> on the owner of the sedan.</i>

14:45.385 --> 14:49.220
Evan Hewson, 28,
no criminal record.

14:49.222 --> 14:54.425
Address: 1382 Emilia Street
with common-law partner

14:54.427 --> 14:57.262
Laura Scheinmann, 29.
Her record's clean also.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.630
Boss, that's five minutes
away from here.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.064
Want some help on the profile?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.299
Yeah. That'd be good.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.400
SAM (over radio):
I'll drop her off,

15:02.402 --> 15:04.602
catch up with you.
PARKER: Copy.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.971
You don't want to come with?

15:06.973 --> 15:09.540
We do a rolling stop,
we'll need the extra vehicle.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.110
Okay. Just as well.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.978
Wouldn't want to get you in
trouble with the little lady.

15:13.980 --> 15:17.081
Remind me:
who dumped who again?

15:21.087 --> 15:22.553
Okay. Pull over here.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.329
What are we doing?

15:31.331 --> 15:32.630
We can't go home.
Yeah, but...

15:32.632 --> 15:35.533
No. We can get some here.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.336
Ev!

15:38.338 --> 15:41.306
You'll be okay.
I'll be right back.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.285
Is everything all right?

15:54.287 --> 15:55.353
A headache.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.322
I just have a headache.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.690
Your friend has gone
to get you something.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.692
Yeah.

16:00.694 --> 16:02.427
(beeping)

16:08.335 --> 16:11.069
No! Don't touch that.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.708
Look, I know you're just trying
to do the right thing,

16:16.710 --> 16:22.146
but there is something
that I need to tell you.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.515
Please listen.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.752
When I'm done, you can do
whatever it is you need to do.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.721
Just, please...

16:29.723 --> 16:31.656
MAN (over radio):
Car T6211, call in.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.658
Please listen.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.527
MAN:
T6211. Ramesh, call in, please.

16:47.007 --> 16:50.341
I've got Oakwood Taxi's GPS
tracking patched in.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.111
You are looking at the entire
active downtown fleet.

16:53.113 --> 16:57.382
No unusual activity reported.
No crisis signals activated.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.378
SPIKE:
<i> I don't like it.</i>

17:10.379 --> 17:12.162
If I got my taxi hijacked,
first thing I'd do

17:12.165 --> 17:13.765
is send the alarm code
to dispatch.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.600
Unless you've been
forced out of the car.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.268
Well, then, I'd have
phoned it in by now.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.669
Maybe you're driving
under threat.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.339
Or worse.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.742
Thanks, Ramesh.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.349
I believe this is yours.

17:46.132 --> 17:49.767
MAN (over radio):
T6211. Call in.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.637
Repeat: Car T6211,
Ramesh, call in.

17:52.639 --> 17:57.508
Lau, Lau, I love you.

17:57.510 --> 18:01.579
Lau, Lau, I love you.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.780
I've known them
about nine years,

18:02.782 --> 18:04.115
since they moved in upstairs.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.683
What kind
of tenants are they?

18:05.685 --> 18:07.385
Quiet. Not a lot of company.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.087
They don't play any loud music.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.289
Any trouble with the rent?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.391
They missed this month.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.759
Is that the first time?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.828
No. Usually,
they call first.

18:16.830 --> 18:19.230
Um... I don't know
what's going on with them.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.399
Any recent changes
in their work situation?

18:21.401 --> 18:23.801
As far as I know, he's still
working at the hospital.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.436
He's an intern.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.605
Uh, Laura tutors English,
but that comes and goes.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.741
Lots of dots.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.176
They won't get far.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.712
(cell phone rings)

18:34.714 --> 18:36.280
Stainton.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.150
What's up, Inspector?

18:39.152 --> 18:41.352
STAINTON:
Looks like our friends
just robbed a drugstore.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.753
Not what I was hoping to hear.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.456
Are you aware
of any drug problems?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.892
No. They're regular people.

18:49.596 --> 18:52.230
All right, stop me
if anything rings a bell.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.731
Mood swings, either direction?

18:53.733 --> 18:55.266
Volatility,

18:55.268 --> 18:58.436
depression, confusion,
secretiveness...

18:58.438 --> 18:59.770
Yeah, secretive.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.305
Well, they scoot by the door

19:01.307 --> 19:02.907
like they don't want me
to see them.

19:02.909 --> 19:06.377
Last time I saw them,
they looked tired, depressed.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.513
You know, dark circles
under their eyes.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.630
From Saint Simon's.
Is that where Evan works?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.400
Hey, Sarge.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.652
Hey, Jules.

19:30.653 --> 19:31.903
We just got word
that Bonnie and Clyde

19:31.905 --> 19:34.639
have stolen syringes
and morphine from a drugstore.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.374
Well, I just found
their home supply.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.809
One syringe and two vials.
So, morphine.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.378
As addictive as heroin.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.913
And tolerance
develops real fast.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.382
JULES:
Yeah, withdrawals are nasty.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.584
Irrational and violent
until they get what they need.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.952
So, we know the substance.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.620
Now we got to get to know
the people underneath.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.788
Okay. Keep me posted.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.141
You got it.

19:53.142 --> 19:55.493
Boss, I think I got 'em.
Car T6211.

19:55.495 --> 19:58.396
Going west on Bloor.
Just passed Jane Street.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.298
Dispatch says
he's not responding to radio.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.667
Car T6211, subject acquired.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.468
Moving takedown,
maximum caution.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.736
Let's move it, guys.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.805
<i> No sirens. Residential area.</i>

20:07.807 --> 20:09.440
<i> We don't want to trigger</i>
<i> a high-speed pursuit.</i>

20:09.442 --> 20:11.275
SAM:<i> Copy.</i>
<i> LEWIS: Copy that.</i>

20:15.315 --> 20:18.616
You remember that night
at The Old Mill?

20:21.788 --> 20:25.289
Your mom made you
ask me to dance.

20:28.394 --> 20:33.731
I'm glad she did.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.868
It's all gone by
pretty fast.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.404
Yeah.

20:43.276 --> 20:46.277
There it is.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.913
Like it was yesterday.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.422
You see that?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.424
Yeah.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.926
We can come at them
from both sides.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.295
Wordy, approach
the driveway

21:04.297 --> 21:05.296
from the west.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.797
We'll take the east with Sam.

21:06.799 --> 21:07.965
WORDY:
Copy.
We got them.

21:20.813 --> 21:21.979
ED:
He's coming towards us.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.581
Let's block it off.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.951
(tires screeching)

21:29.455 --> 21:30.488
Get out of the cab!

21:30.490 --> 21:31.489
Do it now!

21:31.491 --> 21:32.623
Hands out!

21:32.625 --> 21:33.658
Do it now!

21:33.660 --> 21:34.659
Move towards me!

21:34.661 --> 21:35.860
Do it now!
Do it now!

21:35.862 --> 21:37.628
Do it now!
Hands on the hood!

21:37.630 --> 21:39.063
Do it now!
Thank you!

21:40.900 --> 21:42.800
No, they're not here.
You had two
passengers

21:42.802 --> 21:45.603
in your car, male and
a female, late 20s.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.904
Yes?

21:46.906 --> 21:48.372
Well, where are they?

21:48.374 --> 21:49.674
They've gone in there.

21:49.676 --> 21:50.941
Spike, work the truck.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.310
Got it.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.484
Can I help you
with something?

22:00.486 --> 22:01.585
Oh, no.

22:01.587 --> 22:02.887
Are you with
a wedding party?

22:02.889 --> 22:04.555
Oh, we were just
looking around.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.890
To book something
in the future or...?

22:05.892 --> 22:06.924
Uh, yeah, to
book something.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.392
Okay, well,
it's a little late,

22:08.394 --> 22:11.362
but I can schedule you
a consultation.

22:11.364 --> 22:14.398
Let's see what we have here.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.701
Are you looking to book
a summer wedding or...?

22:18.071 --> 22:19.670
ED:
<i> Let's go, guys.</i>

22:19.672 --> 22:21.038
Let's move it. Let's move it.
Let's move it.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.106
What is this place?

22:22.108 --> 22:23.341
Popular wedding spot.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.843
Target-rich environment.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.946
I got onboard security snapshots

22:28.948 --> 22:32.850
from the taxi coming at you.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.485
Thank you, Spike.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.886
How you doing?

22:35.888 --> 22:37.621
Officer Wordsworth.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.090
Hi.

22:39.092 --> 22:41.025
We have a security threat
in your building.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.561
We want you and your staff
to lock down all the exits.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.496
But we don't want to trigger
panic among your guests.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.497
All right.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.598
PARKER:
Okay, we're looking

22:47.600 --> 22:49.066
for a young couple
in their late 20s,

22:49.068 --> 22:50.768
formally dressed,
possibly under the influence.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.069
That's most of our guests.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.504
Does that help?

22:53.505 --> 22:54.938
They were just here
a second ago.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.140
How many rooms in the facility?

22:56.142 --> 22:57.408
There's six reception rooms.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.576
They're all in use.

22:58.578 --> 22:59.877
Excuse me.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.913
¶ You can trust in me
and believe in me... ¶

23:02.915 --> 23:05.116
WOMAN:
Honey, don't touch.

23:05.118 --> 23:08.686
¶ I'll see you
all the way through ¶

23:08.688 --> 23:12.690
¶ 'Cause I'm crazy,
crazy for you ¶

23:12.692 --> 23:16.427
¶ This life used to be ¶

23:17.397 --> 23:19.597
¶ Nothing special at all ¶

23:19.599 --> 23:21.499
¶ That all changed ¶

23:21.501 --> 23:24.835
¶ Now that I have you ¶

23:24.837 --> 23:27.438
¶ Let's have a quick review... ¶

23:27.440 --> 23:28.873
¶ I'm... ¶

23:28.875 --> 23:29.907
There's one room
just to the left

23:29.908 --> 23:30.940
and there's another room
straight ahead.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.744
Thank you, ma'am.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.546
Now, just stay right up
against the wall right here.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.082
WOMAN:
Honey, just stand back.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.718
MAN:
I was just going to try to
find out what's happening.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.957
It's all clear back there.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.592
There's another room over here.

23:48.594 --> 23:49.844
There any other
entrances?

23:49.845 --> 23:51.095
Yep, just around
the west corner over there.

23:51.097 --> 23:54.064
Sam, Wordy, boss...
PARKER:
Let's go.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.005
¶ I'm crazy... ¶

24:01.007 --> 24:03.107
I think I saw a cop.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.676
¶ Crazy for you... ¶

24:07.513 --> 24:09.747
Okay.

24:09.749 --> 24:12.450
Keep dancing. Follow me.

24:14.954 --> 24:18.189
Lau, it's up to you.

24:18.191 --> 24:20.191
Same plan, just faster.

24:25.665 --> 24:26.697
Get him now.

24:26.699 --> 24:27.965
Let's move.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.067
We got to hold 'em back.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.638
Mister, out.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.007
Nobody moves!

24:37.009 --> 24:38.909
(gunshot, people screaming)

24:40.746 --> 24:43.547
Everyone, try to stay calm!

24:43.549 --> 24:45.583
Stop!
Don't move!

24:46.552 --> 24:48.886
Come here, all
of you, over here.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.120
Over here,
over here now!

24:50.122 --> 24:51.121
PARKER:
It's all right.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.990
Just do as he says.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.942
EVAN:
All right, link arms.

24:54.943 --> 24:56.893
Link arms, stay together,
and don't look back.

25:05.071 --> 25:07.905
PARKER:
Evan Hewson, Laura Scheinmann,
this is Greg Parker.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.908
I'm with the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.644
8:44 P.M....
We're here to make sure
no one else gets hurt.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.190
...armed hostage taking.

25:15.191 --> 25:16.735
Sergeant Parker begins
negotiation

25:16.736 --> 25:18.280
with subjects Evan Hewson...
We're going to take our time.

25:18.284 --> 25:19.967
We're gonna slow down.
...and Laura Scheinmann.

25:19.968 --> 25:21.651
Go, go, leave.
We're gonna talk
and we're gonna figure

25:21.654 --> 25:22.753
a way out of this.

25:22.755 --> 25:23.854
How does that sound?

25:23.856 --> 25:27.091
¶ Crazy for you... ¶

25:27.093 --> 25:28.759
Evan, I'm gonna
turn the music off

25:28.761 --> 25:31.862
so I can hear
what you have to say.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.231
Okay?
¶ I'll see you
all the way through... ¶

25:34.233 --> 25:37.768
Mr. DJ, turn
the music off!

25:37.770 --> 25:40.604
¶ Crazy about you... ¶
And get out of here!

25:40.606 --> 25:42.606
¶ Life used to... ¶

25:42.608 --> 25:43.607
(music stops)

25:43.609 --> 25:47.111
Thank you.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.813
Okay, Evan
and Laura,

25:49.815 --> 25:52.650
you want to talk about
what brought us here today?

25:52.652 --> 25:53.651
Get it ready.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.986
What do you mean?

25:55.988 --> 25:58.556
Evan?
Keep your distance!

25:58.558 --> 26:01.125
Sierra 1 in position.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.963
WOMAN:
Whoa.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.735
Oh, my God, that's me.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.573
Boss, there's more to this.

26:15.575 --> 26:16.574
What do you have?

26:16.576 --> 26:17.908
Laura's office.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.743
A battlefield: reminders,

26:19.745 --> 26:22.196
sticky notes everywhere,

26:22.197 --> 26:24.648
like she's fighting
to remember stuff,

26:24.650 --> 26:26.784
like she's...
like she's losing it.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.352
Okay, go through it, Jules.

26:28.354 --> 26:31.889
Let's see if we can find out
what she's trying not to forget.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.190
Got it.

26:35.628 --> 26:37.661
Spike, bring in
the cabbie...

26:37.663 --> 26:39.363
and see if you can
track down any family.

26:39.365 --> 26:40.898
Copy.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.934
I don't recognize
these people.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.039
Do you know
who they are?

26:49.041 --> 26:50.941
EVAN:
It's just you and me, Lau.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.712
What are you
doing with a gun?

26:54.714 --> 26:55.946
Lau, Lau...
Is everything okay,

26:55.948 --> 26:57.247
Evan?
LAURA:
I want

26:57.249 --> 26:58.882
to go home.

26:58.884 --> 27:00.684
I want to go home.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.086
(sobbing):
I want to go home.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.854
It looks like
Laura could use some help.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.857
I hear you two stopped off
at a pharmacy.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.792
You picked up some things.
Hey, come here.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.628
Come here.
Want to talk about that?

27:10.630 --> 27:11.762
LAURA:
I want to go home.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.064
Sierra 1--
no shot, obstruction.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.300
JULES:
Hey, Sarge, I got an appointment
four days ago

27:16.302 --> 27:18.969
at Saint Simon's Hospital--
personal--

27:18.971 --> 27:21.105
with a phone number
for a Dr. Fylin.

27:21.107 --> 27:23.007
Give me the number, Jules.

27:23.009 --> 27:26.243
I really want to get your friend
some help, Evan.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.946
We don't need your help!

27:28.948 --> 27:31.181
Why is that, Evan?
We just need to be left alone.

27:31.183 --> 27:32.783
Okay, why is that?

27:32.785 --> 27:35.185
Just... ten minutes.

27:35.187 --> 27:38.889
We just need ten minutes.
That's it-- ten minutes alone.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.424
Then it doesn't matter.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.259
Tell me what
that means, Evan.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.662
So you weren't driving
under duress?

27:44.664 --> 27:45.663
They didn't
threaten you?

27:45.665 --> 27:46.997
No, sir.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.298
Were they using drugs?

27:48.300 --> 27:50.367
No.

27:50.369 --> 27:53.270
You see a lot of people go
through your cab, right?

27:53.272 --> 27:54.705
What's your take
on these two?

27:54.707 --> 27:57.074
I know what people
who are high look like,

27:57.076 --> 27:59.677
how they smell,
how they talk.

27:59.679 --> 28:02.046
These two...

28:02.048 --> 28:04.014
All right, go on.
She said they
were short

28:04.016 --> 28:05.215
on time.

28:05.217 --> 28:08.285
She said it was
their last night.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.754
They wanted
to dance together.

28:10.756 --> 28:12.990
They wanted to dance
and that's it?

28:12.992 --> 28:15.059
The rest is not
for me to say.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.460
Okay.

28:16.462 --> 28:19.229
Guys, the cab driver
is saying the same thing

28:19.231 --> 28:22.066
that the couple
in the pawn shop said,

28:22.068 --> 28:23.501
that they are "short on time."

28:23.502 --> 28:24.935
SPIKE:
Boss, she's not on morphine.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.470
It's not about getting high.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.039
That doctor's appointment
was with a neurology clinic.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.975
It took a bit of twisting,

28:30.976 --> 28:32.910
but I got Dr. Fylin
to release the diagnosis.

28:32.912 --> 28:37.081
Laura has CJD--
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

28:37.083 --> 28:40.818
Slurred speech, dizziness,
hallucinations.

28:40.820 --> 28:41.819
A brain disorder.

28:41.821 --> 28:44.221
(Laura sobbing)

28:44.223 --> 28:46.090
Spike, I need to know more.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.191
I'm on it.

28:47.193 --> 28:48.959
(typing)

28:48.961 --> 28:51.161
Jules, how much morphine
is in those vials?

28:51.163 --> 28:52.963
120 milligrams.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.832
That's a lethal dose.

28:54.834 --> 28:57.000
SPIKE:
She has spontaneous CJD.
It's very rare.

28:57.002 --> 28:58.652
It's one in a million.

28:58.653 --> 29:00.303
Your brain starts
literally disintegrating.

29:00.306 --> 29:03.006
There's no treatment.
There's no known cure.

29:03.008 --> 29:05.209
You can go from diagnosis to
death in the space of two weeks.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.910
It gets worse by the day.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.479
Laura's losing her memory,
her balance,

29:08.481 --> 29:11.014
her motor skills,
all her major brain functions.

29:11.016 --> 29:13.083
Cab driver said
all they wanted to do was dance.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.018
And then they were going
to go home for the morphine

29:15.020 --> 29:17.087
and that's how the night
was supposed to end.

29:17.089 --> 29:22.059
Yeah, but they couldn't go home,
so he robbed a pharmacy.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.094
Now he's asking
for ten minutes.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.963
Ten minutes
for the dose to take effect.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.415
Sam,

29:27.416 --> 29:28.866
keep your eyes on 'em,
both of 'em.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.267
SAM:
Copy.

29:30.269 --> 29:34.104
(sighs)

29:34.106 --> 29:36.173
Laura, can you hear me?

29:38.144 --> 29:41.044
I'm getting a better
understanding of...

29:41.046 --> 29:42.980
what you went through
today, and...

29:42.982 --> 29:44.348
we know
you're sick.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.349
Are you back?

29:45.351 --> 29:46.383
Yeah.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.384
Can't imagine

29:47.386 --> 29:48.519
what that must be like.

29:48.521 --> 29:50.287
I'm sorry.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.054
I'm gonna keep him talking.
But everything I'm seeing
today tells me...

29:52.057 --> 29:53.457
Can you get it ready?

29:53.459 --> 29:55.025
Can you do that, Lo?
...that you're
very strong...

29:55.027 --> 29:56.827
Yes.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.295
...that you and Evan
are very strong

29:58.297 --> 30:00.097
and you're very brave.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.199
You're not going
to take us apart.

30:06.372 --> 30:09.406
Boss, she's opening her bag.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.542
She's doing something inside it.
What do you see?

30:11.544 --> 30:13.177
It's the morphine;
they're cutting to the chase.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.945
Ed, what's your take?

30:14.947 --> 30:16.046
Sam, you got the shot?

30:16.048 --> 30:17.414
Multiple hostages.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.150
It's high-risk.
Less lethal-- can you do it?

30:20.152 --> 30:21.451
Do we<i> want</i> to do it?

30:21.453 --> 30:23.487
There's a risk
we hit the hostages.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.023
We go less lethal,
we're looking at an injury.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.891
We let her do
what she wants to do

30:27.893 --> 30:29.459
and we are looking at a death.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.161
We can't let her kill herself.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.597
Yeah, copy.

30:33.599 --> 30:34.898
Morphine's painless.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.133
What are you saying, Spike?

30:36.135 --> 30:38.035
Isn't this her life--
what's left of it?

30:38.037 --> 30:40.103
I'm just saying maybe we should
be looking the other way.

30:40.105 --> 30:42.272
Maybe it's better
we let her have what she wants.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.091
Can't do it.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.909
We interfere, the subject
could start shooting.

30:45.911 --> 30:48.278
So we put lives at risk to save
somebody who's already dying?

30:48.280 --> 30:50.247
ED:
Our job is to save lives.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.516
We're cops. We're not judges.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.551
Boss?

30:54.553 --> 30:56.320
Yeah, he's right.
We put it in play.

30:57.289 --> 31:00.224
Jules.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.258
Yeah, boss?

31:01.260 --> 31:03.093
Get Frank McAndrew on the phone

31:03.095 --> 31:06.430
and tell him this: I'd like to
solicit his legal opinion here

31:06.432 --> 31:10.000
on these two staying together
based on compassionate grounds.

31:10.002 --> 31:12.603
If she has two weeks to live,

31:12.605 --> 31:14.938
then they're not gonna
spend it apart.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.240
Got it.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.141
And when I say opinion,
I mean

31:18.143 --> 31:21.245
he calls his favorite judge

31:21.246 --> 31:24.348
and he works his famous powers
of persuasion. Hear me?

31:26.285 --> 31:28.118
We take the shot, he will
accelerate. He's still armed.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.287
We can use the distraction
to clear the hostages.

31:30.289 --> 31:31.321
Copy that.

31:33.192 --> 31:34.558
She's filling the syringe.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.460
Sam, take the shot
if you see it.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.937
Ready, Lau?

31:46.939 --> 31:49.306
I'm ready.

31:53.946 --> 31:55.312
(gunshot)

31:55.313 --> 31:56.679
No, no, no!

31:56.682 --> 32:00.350
ED:
Keep the weapon lowered, Evan.
Just keep it down. That's it.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.219
What did you do?!

32:02.221 --> 32:03.587
Sorry we had to do that, Evan.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.422
You won't let them take us!

32:05.424 --> 32:06.957
Stay back!

32:06.959 --> 32:08.225
LAURA:
What are we gonna do?!

32:08.227 --> 32:09.944
Evan?

32:09.945 --> 32:11.662
It's okay.
Lau, Lau, it's okay.
What are we gonna do?!

32:11.664 --> 32:14.097
We'll figure a way
out of here.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.432
Just put the gun on the floor,
Evan.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.100
Don't tell me what to do!

32:17.102 --> 32:19.469
We're gonna talk through this,
but you gotta look at me.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.204
You gotta look at me, Evan.

32:21.206 --> 32:25.609
No!
Evan, Evan...

32:32.584 --> 32:34.418
Do it.

32:37.289 --> 32:40.357
(cocks gun)

32:40.359 --> 32:42.392
Do it!

32:49.034 --> 32:50.033
Evan!
Please?

32:50.035 --> 32:52.569
Please?

32:52.571 --> 32:55.038
Laura?

32:55.040 --> 32:58.008
Please?

32:58.010 --> 32:58.608
Give them space.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.410
Sam, switch to lethal.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.646
Copy.

33:06.518 --> 33:09.319
This is crazy.
My son is not a drug user.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.454
He-he does not rob stores.

33:10.456 --> 33:11.688
I know that,
Mrs. Hewson,

33:11.690 --> 33:13.123
and I need you to stay calm

33:13.125 --> 33:16.593
because I need you
to help me help Evan.

33:16.595 --> 33:19.162
Evan and Laura have known
each other for a long time?

33:19.164 --> 33:20.263
13 years.
13 years?

33:20.265 --> 33:21.732
This is where they met.

33:21.734 --> 33:25.135
Best thing that
ever happened to him.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.704
Okay, I'm really sorry,
but I have to tell you

33:27.706 --> 33:31.241
some sad news
about Laura.

33:32.211 --> 33:33.710
I got the solution.

33:33.712 --> 33:36.313
Evan... please.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.682
Please.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.484
Evan, don't
do that.

33:40.486 --> 33:42.386
(whimpering)

33:42.388 --> 33:43.754
Please!

33:47.059 --> 33:48.692
Please.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.660
Thank you, Evan.
That's the right choice.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.295
That gun
goes up again...

33:52.297 --> 33:53.430
I hear you.

33:54.466 --> 33:56.800
Evan, please.

33:56.802 --> 34:00.504
Evan, I'm sorry for what's
going on in your life.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.706
And I really want
to help you, but I got

34:02.708 --> 34:04.074
to tell you...

34:04.076 --> 34:06.243
that we can't let you
hurt Laura.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.477
LAURA:
No.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.714
I don't get to make
many choices anymore,

34:10.716 --> 34:14.551
but this choice is mine.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.655
We... we've talked
about it

34:18.657 --> 34:20.824
for four days,
four nights.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.810
We... we made a video.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.795
It's at home,
so that when I'm gone,

34:24.797 --> 34:26.430
Evan won't be blamed.

34:26.432 --> 34:28.198
Oh, God.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.666
This is why.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.102
Mrs. Hewson?

34:32.104 --> 34:35.505
Last week, he came to see me.

34:35.507 --> 34:38.809
Just dropped in,
wanted to go for a walk.

34:38.811 --> 34:41.845
He held my hand.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.247
He never does that anymore.

34:44.249 --> 34:47.084
He told me he loved me
like it was good-bye.

34:47.086 --> 34:48.151
Why would
he do that?

34:48.153 --> 34:49.820
Jules, how much morphine
did you find

34:49.822 --> 34:51.288
at their place-- how many doses?

34:51.290 --> 34:54.257
Oh, God... oh, God.

34:54.259 --> 34:57.227
I'm not going
to break my promise.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.362
She gets everything

34:59.364 --> 35:00.764
she wants today.

35:00.766 --> 35:03.767
SPIKE (over radio):
Two vials, 120 milligrams each.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.235
Copy, Spike.

35:05.237 --> 35:06.570
Boss?
Yeah.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.856
I heard it.

35:08.857 --> 35:11.141
You guys have known each other
a long time, right?

35:11.143 --> 35:13.844
13 years,
so since you were... what?

35:13.846 --> 35:15.612
Fifteen.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.115
15-- that's
a long time.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.883
That's a lifetime.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.185
That's a lot of memories.

35:22.187 --> 35:23.753
Laura, I know...

35:23.755 --> 35:26.223
I know something about memories,

35:26.225 --> 35:28.625
and I know a little something
about what happens

35:28.627 --> 35:30.327
when someone
shoots someone else.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.762
It's not like you think it is.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.631
It's horrible.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.134
It's messy as hell.

35:37.136 --> 35:40.170
I mean, you see
something like that,

35:40.172 --> 35:42.405
that image stays in your head.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.807
Don't... don't listen
to him, Lau.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.842
And what you're asking
Evan to do,

35:45.844 --> 35:48.545
it's going to be the last memory
he has of you.

35:48.547 --> 35:49.779
It's going to be the last thing

35:49.781 --> 35:51.915
he sees every night
before he goes to sleep.

35:52.885 --> 35:53.884
Don't believe him.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.218
There's lots I'm going to see

35:55.220 --> 35:56.753
when I close my eyes
at night, okay?

35:56.755 --> 35:58.889
But I got to be honest
with you, Laura.

35:58.891 --> 36:01.525
It's not going to get that far.

36:01.527 --> 36:02.893
See, my team...

36:03.929 --> 36:05.228
is going to
shoot Evan

36:05.230 --> 36:06.463
before he shoots you.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.898
(gasping)

36:07.900 --> 36:09.366
It's the law.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.934
That's our job.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.936
To not let him do that.

36:12.938 --> 36:15.172
I'll take my chances.

36:15.174 --> 36:16.840
ED:
Did Laura know

36:16.841 --> 36:18.507
about the last part
of your plan here, Evan?

36:18.510 --> 36:20.210
The part where you intended

36:20.212 --> 36:22.279
to use that second dose
of morphine on yourself?

36:22.281 --> 36:23.547
Did she know that?

36:23.549 --> 36:26.383
120 milligrams is a lethal dose.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.851
Now, you knew that, right?

36:27.853 --> 36:29.819
You knew that
that's what it would take.

36:29.821 --> 36:33.256
Did you tell her
that you had a second vial?

36:33.258 --> 36:35.725
Did you tell her
you were going to kill yourself,

36:35.727 --> 36:37.794
that you were going
to go with her?

36:37.796 --> 36:40.263
Did you tell her that?

36:40.265 --> 36:41.498
Ev?

36:43.468 --> 36:44.935
(sighs)

36:44.937 --> 36:47.304
But why?

36:49.708 --> 36:50.807
ED:
Hold off, guys.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.709
Let's give them
some space.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.879
I can't.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.681
I don't want to.

36:57.683 --> 37:00.817
I don't want to live
without you, Lau.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.986
You have to.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.422
You have to.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.791
Please.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.726
I can't.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.995
I can't.
No.

37:11.997 --> 37:15.966
You have so much time still.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.937
Your mom... she needs you.

37:20.939 --> 37:24.307
And... and your family
needs you.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.379
You are going to love
someone else someday.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.947
Lau, that's not going to happen.

37:30.949 --> 37:32.282
Yes, it is.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.352
Yes, it is.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.887
Evan...

37:37.889 --> 37:40.690
how am I going to live on
if you don't live?

37:48.834 --> 37:51.268
JULES (over radio):
Sarge, I just heard back
from McAndrew.

37:51.270 --> 37:52.669
He thinks they can swing it.

37:52.671 --> 37:53.837
Copy that.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.372
Good work, Eddie.

37:56.341 --> 37:58.875
Evan?

37:58.877 --> 38:00.910
No matter how much time
you have left--

38:00.912 --> 38:02.312
two days or two weeks-

38:02.314 --> 38:03.513
we're going to make sure

38:03.515 --> 38:05.915
that the two of you
stay together.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.585
We're not going to split you up.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.754
Are you with me?

38:19.064 --> 38:20.897
(sighs)

38:20.899 --> 38:24.334
("Lullaby (Chopin Ballade)"
by Melanie Doane playing)

38:51.096 --> 38:52.095
¶ Tonight ¶

38:52.097 --> 38:55.065
So that's the story.

38:55.067 --> 38:58.368
¶ And every night ¶

38:58.370 --> 39:01.504
I'm sorry, Mom, Dad,
all of you guys,

39:01.506 --> 39:04.107
for not giving
any advance warning.

39:04.109 --> 39:07.811
¶ I will be here by your side ¶

39:07.813 --> 39:10.680
<i> I guess I didn't really</i>
<i> get much warning myself.</i>

39:10.682 --> 39:14.718
¶ No need to be afraid ¶

39:14.720 --> 39:19.089
<i> But I...</i>
<i> I just don't want a fuss.</i>

39:19.091 --> 39:21.524
<i> You know, you get that, right?</i>

39:21.526 --> 39:25.829
¶ Close your eyes,
close your eyes ¶

39:25.831 --> 39:27.630
I don't want pity

39:27.632 --> 39:30.834
or two weeks of good-byes.

39:37.843 --> 39:42.946
¶ And when you do ¶

39:42.948 --> 39:46.116
¶ I look at you ¶

39:46.118 --> 39:48.651
¶ In wonder ¶

39:48.653 --> 39:51.554
¶ I wonder ¶

39:51.556 --> 39:57.160
¶ Can you truly be mine? ¶

39:57.162 --> 40:00.797
¶ Be mine ¶

40:00.799 --> 40:05.935
¶ Be mine. ¶
