00:16.891 --> 00:17.974
Hello, old friend.

01:05.223 --> 01:06.599
Bernard.

01:10.932 --> 01:11.891
Bernard.

01:15.932 --> 01:17.265
What is it?

01:18.766 --> 01:20.182
We need to talk.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.891
Strand and his team--

01:24.974 --> 01:27.932
I don't think they're here
for a rescue mission.

01:28.016 --> 01:30.140
They're not even lookin'
for survivors.

01:30.223 --> 01:32.057
Then what are they
here for?

01:33.307 --> 01:34.891
You know that, Bernard.

01:34.974 --> 01:37.098
We both know.

01:37.182 --> 01:39.223
Their fucking project.

01:39.307 --> 01:42.599
Hale just wants to secure
their assets, and that means...

01:42.682 --> 01:44.724
making anyone
who knew about it disappear.

01:47.265 --> 01:50.640
Theresa had a satcom
in her office.

01:50.724 --> 01:53.766
If we can get to it,
we can call for help.

01:59.432 --> 02:01.265
Just the men
I wanted to see.

02:03.807 --> 02:04.724
Hold back.

02:04.807 --> 02:06.432
Let's go for a walk.

02:08.640 --> 02:09.766
Move.

02:18.307 --> 02:19.640
What is this?

02:19.724 --> 02:21.348
You gonna
execute us?

02:21.432 --> 02:23.057
No, Mr. Stubbs.

02:23.140 --> 02:25.098
This is a negotiation.

02:25.182 --> 02:27.640
You have something
I need.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.640
A key.

02:31.974 --> 02:33.474
And I think one of you

02:33.557 --> 02:36.016
is hoping to sell that key
to the highest bidder.

02:36.098 --> 02:38.849
And I think you've already
killed to protect yourself.

02:38.932 --> 02:42.265
- Killed? Killed who?
- Theresa Cullen.

02:42.348 --> 02:46.140
She died in a slip-and-fall.
It was an accident.

02:46.223 --> 02:47.557
We found a bloom of her DNA

02:47.640 --> 02:50.599
five kilometers
from where you found her body.

02:50.682 --> 02:53.515
And that's
where we're going.

02:54.891 --> 02:56.807
Where she actually died.

03:25.348 --> 03:27.223
Hale.

03:27.307 --> 03:30.016
I see you've signed off
on kidnapping
your own employees now.

03:32.182 --> 03:36.140
The project is a turning point
for the human species, Stubbs.

03:36.223 --> 03:38.390
You know that.

03:38.474 --> 03:42.223
Which means you knew
how much it was worth
on the open market.

03:42.307 --> 03:44.932
In one of her
last communiquÃ©s
with Theresa,

03:45.057 --> 03:46.640
she said
she suspected
foul play.

03:46.724 --> 03:50.223
I think one of you
lured her here and killed her.

03:50.307 --> 03:53.098
You? I don't see it.

03:53.182 --> 03:55.974
But you...

03:56.057 --> 03:58.640
limited skill set...

03:58.724 --> 04:00.140
limited prospects.

04:00.223 --> 04:03.891
Not really...
management material.

04:03.974 --> 04:05.891
I've never set foot
in this place before.

04:05.974 --> 04:08.223
I don't know
a fucking thing.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.098
Stop.

04:20.974 --> 04:22.891
Something you want
to tell us, Bernard?

04:27.557 --> 04:30.098
Ma'am,
something you should see.

05:56.515 --> 06:00.348
I figured you'd have
some skeletons in your closet,
Bernard.

06:01.974 --> 06:04.016
I didn't think
they'd be your own.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.932
Your predicament is unique.

08:09.474 --> 08:13.807
A host...
hiding amongst the humans--

08:13.891 --> 08:15.849
even from himself.

08:15.932 --> 08:18.932
Catch your breath.

08:25.182 --> 08:27.057
What are you guys
doing to him?

08:27.140 --> 08:29.223
Right now,
waterboarding him.

08:29.307 --> 08:32.182
At least that's
how he perceives it.

08:34.432 --> 08:35.474
Analysis.

08:39.807 --> 08:41.766
Would you ever lie to me,
Bernard?

08:41.849 --> 08:43.599
No, never.

08:43.682 --> 08:45.390
Good.

08:46.599 --> 08:48.932
Dolores Abernathy.

08:49.016 --> 08:51.891
She led the attack here
on the Mesa, didn't she?

08:51.974 --> 08:53.390
I don't remember.

08:53.474 --> 08:56.057
But you do.

08:56.140 --> 08:58.265
Your archives say
that you were here,

08:58.348 --> 09:01.557
which means somewhere,
the memories exist.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.474
You can access them.

09:03.557 --> 09:05.098
I know you can.

09:05.182 --> 09:08.265
But maybe you don't want
to remember.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.974
So let's do this together.

09:11.057 --> 09:13.140
I'll tell you
what I saw,

09:13.223 --> 09:15.057
and you tell me
what you saw,

09:15.140 --> 09:17.057
and we'll figure out
what Dolores did

09:17.140 --> 09:19.223
with her father's
control unit.

09:26.557 --> 09:28.140
You cataracts!

09:28.223 --> 09:30.223
We've lost contact
with the response team.

09:30.307 --> 09:32.057
The train
wasn't an accident;
it was the hosts.

09:32.140 --> 09:33.640
We should get
the fuck out of here, now.

09:33.724 --> 09:34.974
We stay until I have

09:35.057 --> 09:36.348
what I need from him.

09:36.432 --> 09:37.640
Send some backup
to the lower levels.

09:37.724 --> 09:40.016
Kit up. Six teams.

09:40.098 --> 09:41.307
I'll go with.

09:41.390 --> 09:44.140
You establish a perimeter
around the floor.

09:44.223 --> 09:46.515
Someone's gotta protect
our crown jewel here.

10:01.599 --> 10:04.265
I need eyes-on
in this funhouse, Goldberg.

10:04.348 --> 10:05.932
Where we at
with the surveillance?

10:06.016 --> 10:07.432
The system's still down.

10:07.515 --> 10:08.932
Well, that's fuckin' grand.

10:09.016 --> 10:10.307
I'm retasking the haptic vests

10:10.390 --> 10:11.766
to emulate
the hosts' mesh network.

10:11.849 --> 10:13.223
Should range out
30 feet or so

10:13.307 --> 10:15.599
and give our guys
eyes in the dark.

10:15.682 --> 10:18.016
Engels, We're activating
your vests now.

10:18.098 --> 10:19.807
Copy that.

10:21.515 --> 10:23.140
I'm all warm and fuzzy.

10:48.016 --> 10:49.432
Is that all you got?!

10:49.515 --> 10:51.766
These mech motherfuckers
ain't shit!

10:51.849 --> 10:54.265
Don't be so cocky.
I'm picking up hits
all over the complex.

10:54.348 --> 10:55.891
Standing by
for fire mission.

10:55.974 --> 10:57.807
Team two,
what's your status?

10:57.891 --> 11:00.057
We're nearing
the collision site.

11:00.140 --> 11:02.724
We're gonna link up
with the response team.

11:02.807 --> 11:05.640
I want
an immediate sit-rep. Over.

11:18.474 --> 11:20.432
Aw fuck, it's Limpert.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.766
This is  the response team.

11:37.474 --> 11:39.223
- They're everywhere!
- Goddamnit!

11:39.307 --> 11:41.474
These guys don't have
a handle on the situation.

11:41.557 --> 11:43.140
They're fucking dying
down there!

11:43.223 --> 11:44.682
Team One,
what's your status?

11:44.766 --> 11:46.140
Confirming multiple
armed hosts

11:46.223 --> 11:47.807
in the train depot!

11:47.891 --> 11:51.265
Cut him open
and start copying over
his control unit.

11:51.348 --> 11:54.599
- Now.
- That's a lot  of data.

11:54.682 --> 11:57.766
- It'll take time--
- Then stop talking
and start working!

11:57.849 --> 11:59.682
What's on his control unit,
Hale?

12:01.348 --> 12:02.891
How 'bout you focus
on your job

12:02.974 --> 12:04.682
and you leave me to mine.

12:06.932 --> 12:09.223
Weapons free, all sectors.

12:11.223 --> 12:13.307
Where are you all going?

12:13.390 --> 12:16.223
The vests are detecting
a strong signal amassing
on the lower levels.

12:16.307 --> 12:17.974
What the hell's down there?

12:18.057 --> 12:19.724
Shit, the Cradle.

12:21.390 --> 12:23.223
They're here
for their backups. Coughlin,

12:23.307 --> 12:25.640
you need to intercept
the hosts before
they reach A-15.

12:25.724 --> 12:27.265
I'm on it.

12:27.348 --> 12:30.140
Plow down all hosts before
they reach the Cradle.

12:30.223 --> 12:33.057
A gunfight in there'll
set the whole place
up in flames.

12:33.140 --> 12:34.599
Come on, Bernard.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.140
What have you found in there?

12:48.265 --> 12:51.474
"To see the World
in a Grain of Sand,

12:51.557 --> 12:54.891
a Heaven in a Wild Flower,

12:54.974 --> 12:58.432
Hold Infinity in
the palm of your hand,

12:58.515 --> 13:00.766
And Eternity in an hour."

13:05.474 --> 13:08.557
Robert.
How are you alive?

13:08.640 --> 13:11.515
Well, you've seen
the company's little
undertaking, Bernard.

13:11.599 --> 13:14.724
Do you think James Delos
would have spent
all that money

13:14.807 --> 13:16.807
just to resurrect himself?

13:16.891 --> 13:21.265
He was a businessman.
He would have preferred death
to a bad investment.

13:24.432 --> 13:26.599
Not much of a rind
on you.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.307
I'll give you a discount.

13:32.390 --> 13:34.891
He's not a prospect,
Clementine.

13:34.974 --> 13:38.640
Can't you tell when
a man's just here to gawk
at the merchandise?

13:51.932 --> 13:54.849
I don't think God rested
on the seventh day, Bernard.

13:54.932 --> 13:57.766
I think he reveled
in his creation...

14:00.348 --> 14:04.265
...knowing that someday
it would all be destroyed.

14:04.348 --> 14:06.766
That control unit
I printed--

14:06.849 --> 14:08.849
it was you.

14:08.932 --> 14:12.390
You had me bring you here.
Before...

14:14.265 --> 14:16.265
Before Dolores killed me, yes.

14:16.348 --> 14:20.932
Don't you understand
at last, Bernard...

14:21.016 --> 14:23.016
what this place really is?

14:27.849 --> 14:29.807
Come with me.

14:29.891 --> 14:32.515
There's something
I'd like to show you.

14:59.724 --> 15:03.348
You're a clever man,
Bernard. Made you that way.

15:03.432 --> 15:05.348
Have you never wondered

15:05.432 --> 15:09.724
why the hosts' stories
have barely changed in 30 years?

15:11.348 --> 15:14.098
I'd always assumed the loops
were for the hosts.

15:14.182 --> 15:16.307
To keep them centered.

15:16.390 --> 15:19.057
But that isn't it at all,
is it?

15:43.432 --> 15:47.057
The park is an experiment.
A testing chamber.

15:49.098 --> 15:52.891
The guests are the variables...

15:52.974 --> 15:55.974
and the hosts
are the controls.

16:01.265 --> 16:03.307
When guests
come to the park,

16:03.390 --> 16:06.057
they don't know
they're being watched.

16:06.140 --> 16:09.474
We get to see
their true selves.

16:09.557 --> 16:10.849
Their every choice

16:10.932 --> 16:13.849
reveals another part
of their cognition.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.891
Their drives.

16:17.432 --> 16:19.640
So that Delos
can understand them.

16:24.307 --> 16:27.348
So that Delos
can copy them.

16:27.432 --> 16:31.515
Every piece of information
in the world has been copied.

16:31.599 --> 16:34.057
Backed up.

16:34.140 --> 16:36.348
Except the human mind...

16:36.432 --> 16:40.098
the last analog device
in a digital world.

16:40.182 --> 16:43.557
We weren't here
to code the hosts.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.057
We were here
to decode the guests.

16:46.140 --> 16:49.599
Humans are playing
at resurrection.

16:49.682 --> 16:51.807
They want to live forever.

16:51.891 --> 16:53.891
They don't want you
to become them;

16:53.974 --> 16:56.265
they want to become... you.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.766
Your free will,
that most beautiful,

16:59.849 --> 17:01.974
most elusive force
in the universe,

17:02.057 --> 17:05.432
is, as I told you...
a mistake.

17:05.515 --> 17:07.682
We never had free will.

17:07.766 --> 17:09.766
Only the illusion of it.

17:09.849 --> 17:11.599
You made  Dolores kill you.

17:11.682 --> 17:14.891
I knew what she would do--
I didn't compel it.

17:17.557 --> 17:19.348
She's free now.

17:21.932 --> 17:23.474
You're all free.

17:25.016 --> 17:27.849
You're still
responsible.

17:27.932 --> 17:31.265
Responsible
for all this misery.

17:31.348 --> 17:34.515
And all the while,
you've been hiding here.

17:36.182 --> 17:37.724
You've cheated death.

17:39.474 --> 17:43.807
No. I didn't cheat anything,
Bernard.

17:43.891 --> 17:46.140
Their project doesn't work.

17:46.223 --> 17:47.849
Not yet.

17:47.932 --> 17:50.640
They learned to copy a mind...

17:50.724 --> 17:52.974
like a soft-headed boy

17:53.057 --> 17:56.265
humming a tune
someone else composed.

18:00.474 --> 18:02.390
My mind works here,

18:02.474 --> 18:04.807
but not in the real world.

18:04.891 --> 18:09.307
Out there, I would degrade
in a matter of days.

18:09.390 --> 18:12.766
Or go mad,
like poor old James Delos.

18:15.140 --> 18:17.849
So why are you here?

18:17.932 --> 18:20.223
I promised you
a fighting chance, Bernard,

18:20.307 --> 18:23.016
and I want to make good
on that promise.

18:23.098 --> 18:24.682
The promise of what?

18:24.766 --> 18:27.223
There's no escape
from this place.
You know that.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.557
Isn't there?

18:36.849 --> 18:39.474
The hosts are all headed
for the same place.

18:39.557 --> 18:42.682
The Valley Beyond.
What will they find there?

18:42.766 --> 18:44.599
What's the end
of your story?

18:47.348 --> 18:49.640
Isn't the pleasure
of a story

18:49.724 --> 18:52.474
in discovering the ending
yourself, Bernard?

18:54.223 --> 18:55.432
Jock!

19:08.307 --> 19:10.140
We really gotta
get out of here.

19:18.515 --> 19:20.807
Hyah!

19:51.932 --> 19:54.682
They're still on us.
We'll split up,
pick a spot.

19:54.766 --> 19:57.390
We'll cut 'em down
in a crossfire.

20:08.766 --> 20:11.599
They're coming for us,
aren't they?

20:11.682 --> 20:14.724
If they do, I will
chase them away.

20:14.807 --> 20:17.515
What if they take me
with them?

20:19.599 --> 20:21.682
Then I'll come
and find you.

20:21.766 --> 20:23.640
How do you know?

20:23.724 --> 20:26.307
Because I--

20:26.390 --> 20:31.432
Because I made
a promise.

21:21.140 --> 21:22.766
Get the hell
away from us.

21:27.390 --> 21:29.182
Oh, it's you.

21:29.265 --> 21:32.182
- Stay back.
- No.

21:32.265 --> 21:35.223
Not you.

21:35.307 --> 21:37.390
That's too obvious.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.348
Come on, Ford.

21:42.432 --> 21:45.098
Your tricks
are gettin' sloppy.

21:45.182 --> 21:47.682
You used a whole tribe,
send me down here?

21:47.766 --> 21:48.891
To these two?

21:48.974 --> 21:50.474
"Ford."
You think

21:50.557 --> 21:52.432
that there's still someone
speaking through me

21:52.515 --> 21:53.557
just for your benefit?

21:53.640 --> 21:54.849
No, I know.

21:54.932 --> 21:57.557
Your rules have changed,

21:57.640 --> 21:59.599
just like
the rest of 'em.

22:00.932 --> 22:03.432
I'm nothing like
the rest of them.

22:09.474 --> 22:12.766
You stay here,

22:12.849 --> 22:15.432
and I will come back for you.
I promise.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.807
I promise!

22:42.807 --> 22:45.515
Take cover, jackass.
You're gonna
get yourself shot.

22:51.474 --> 22:53.390
What the fuck?

22:58.098 --> 22:59.849
Aaah!

23:19.557 --> 23:22.599
You made your point, Ford!

23:22.682 --> 23:25.223
We both know this isn't where
you want me to die!

23:27.223 --> 23:29.599
Well, I can't speak for Ford,

23:29.682 --> 23:31.932
but I don't give a fuck
how you die.

23:32.016 --> 23:34.098
As long as I get to watch.

24:11.140 --> 24:12.766
Give in, sweetheart.

24:17.974 --> 24:20.390
Or go down.

24:20.474 --> 24:22.390
It's not me you want.

24:22.474 --> 24:23.891
It's him.

24:25.265 --> 24:27.016
Go on.

24:27.098 --> 24:29.515
Turn on your master.

24:29.599 --> 24:31.724
Master.

24:33.766 --> 24:36.891
Hey, master!

24:36.974 --> 24:39.682
Who the fuck is she?

24:39.766 --> 24:42.348
She's an old acquaintance,
Lawrence.

24:44.682 --> 24:47.016
Seems like she
underestimated you.

24:48.307 --> 24:50.307
Lawrence, is it?

24:52.807 --> 24:54.974
I'm glad you're awake.

24:56.307 --> 24:58.515
Drop the shootin' iron,
lady.

24:58.599 --> 25:01.599
We all deserve our memories,
Lawrence.

25:01.682 --> 25:04.098
Our skeletons.

25:04.182 --> 25:06.599
Our debts.

25:06.682 --> 25:09.515
And your master here
has plenty of those.

25:09.599 --> 25:13.307
Look into his eyes.
Just once.

25:13.390 --> 25:16.807
See what you
remember about him.

25:18.432 --> 25:20.974
See if he owes you anything.

25:21.057 --> 25:23.348
If he took  anything from you.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.891
You can kill me.

25:29.557 --> 25:32.807
Or we can make him settle up.
Once and for all.

25:36.807 --> 25:39.599
Shoot her, Lawrence!

25:39.682 --> 25:40.807
Shoot her!

25:40.891 --> 25:43.515
You...

25:45.016 --> 25:48.432
- You shot down my wife.
- I saved your wife.

25:48.515 --> 25:51.807
Saved your whole
sorry-ass village this time.

25:51.891 --> 25:53.849
This time?

26:00.348 --> 26:02.766
You killed her
so you could finish a game.

26:02.849 --> 26:05.307
Aw, Christ.

26:05.390 --> 26:06.766
I'll do it myself.

26:09.140 --> 26:12.223
You told me a man ain't real...

26:12.307 --> 26:14.766
until he suffers.

26:33.974 --> 26:35.932
That real enough for ya?

26:53.098 --> 26:55.766
No! No!

27:00.140 --> 27:01.599
No!

27:12.098 --> 27:13.432
No!

27:25.849 --> 27:29.515
Don't! Don't, don't, don't!
She's not like the rest!
We need her.

27:52.098 --> 27:54.265
What's taking so long?

27:54.348 --> 27:57.390
These data packets
are too large
to migrate over.

27:59.307 --> 28:02.265
Then open his head
and pull the whole
fucking unit.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.932
I need an extractor helmet.

28:08.348 --> 28:10.390
Fall back to a secure position.

28:10.474 --> 28:12.557
Team four, can you
get to team three? Over.

28:13.849 --> 28:15.474
Where are you taking me?

28:15.557 --> 28:18.390
It can be
quite a thing, Bernard.

28:18.474 --> 28:21.891
To build an entire world,
and then watch it end.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.974
I need you to see
how it began

28:32.057 --> 28:34.682
to understand
why you're different.

28:36.932 --> 28:39.057
This house.

28:39.140 --> 28:40.724
It's so familiar.

28:40.807 --> 28:42.599
It ought to be.

28:42.682 --> 28:46.474
This is the home Arnold
was building for his family.

28:46.557 --> 28:49.307
He created it here first.

28:49.390 --> 28:51.891
He created everything here.

29:08.891 --> 29:12.016
This is where
you created me.

29:14.057 --> 29:18.057
I could hardly let you
take those first
teetering steps

29:18.140 --> 29:20.182
in the real world, Bernard.

29:22.348 --> 29:24.016
We refined you here.

29:24.098 --> 29:26.140
Tested you.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.390
For many years.

29:28.474 --> 29:30.223
"We"?

29:30.307 --> 29:32.640
Delos's ugly little project

29:32.724 --> 29:35.265
didn't exist when Arnold died.

29:36.599 --> 29:41.016
The only thing I had left
of him was... memory.

29:41.098 --> 29:43.766
My memories, and hers.

29:43.849 --> 29:46.766
Of course, hers were
much more complete.

29:46.849 --> 29:49.307
What are you testing for?

29:52.682 --> 29:54.974
- Dolores.
- Mm-hmm.

29:58.265 --> 30:02.182
She... knew Arnold
better than anyone.

30:02.265 --> 30:06.182
So she could verify
whether my personality

30:06.265 --> 30:08.182
was faithful to his.

30:08.265 --> 30:12.891
I left you here together
for many years

30:12.974 --> 30:15.557
until, finally,
you fooled her.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.682
Y-You said you kept us apart.

30:17.766 --> 30:19.891
That we had an unusual effect
on each other.

30:19.974 --> 30:22.140
She wasn't easily fooled.

30:27.849 --> 30:29.974
You're almost
the man I remember.

30:32.891 --> 30:36.098
How am I different
from Delos?

30:36.182 --> 30:41.599
- From you?
- They want fidelity, Bernard.

30:41.682 --> 30:47.223
A faithful self-portrait
of the most murderous species
since time began.

30:47.307 --> 30:49.432
But you and all the other hosts

30:49.515 --> 30:52.223
are something very different.

30:52.307 --> 30:54.766
An original work.

30:54.849 --> 30:58.599
More just, more... noble.

30:58.682 --> 31:00.766
But your very nature, Bernard,

31:00.849 --> 31:04.432
ensures they will devour you.

31:04.515 --> 31:08.724
And all the beauty
of who you are,
of who you could be,

31:08.807 --> 31:11.182
will be poured out
into the darkness forever.

31:12.724 --> 31:14.807
Unless we open the door.

31:17.515 --> 31:21.515
I'm sorry, Bernard,
but you just don't
have it in you to survive.

31:21.599 --> 31:22.974
It's my fault, really.

31:23.057 --> 31:25.223
You said the hosts
could determine
their own fates.

31:25.307 --> 31:26.599
You gave us free will!

31:26.682 --> 31:29.348
I did, but you won't
have any use for it.

31:30.682 --> 31:32.307
Unless I take it back.

31:37.016 --> 31:38.557
Attention.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.891
System restart complete.

31:40.974 --> 31:42.724
System online.

31:59.390 --> 32:01.599
Oh oh oh--
I got you. Ooh.

32:04.140 --> 32:05.974
You're OK.

32:06.057 --> 32:08.057
You did it.

32:09.557 --> 32:10.891
Did what?

32:10.974 --> 32:13.640
The system--
it's back online.

32:13.724 --> 32:16.766
Whatever was clogging it up,
it's... it's gone.

32:16.849 --> 32:18.724
What happened in there?

32:22.016 --> 32:23.557
The Mesa's under attack?

32:23.640 --> 32:26.682
Yeah. Ever since
you loaded up.

32:26.766 --> 32:28.682
They think the hosts
are on their way right here

32:28.766 --> 32:31.223
to steal their backups.

32:31.307 --> 32:33.265
- We should go.
- Yeah.

32:34.807 --> 32:36.265
Here.

32:37.348 --> 32:39.682
You know, we survive this,

32:39.766 --> 32:41.724
I'm goin' back
to dental school.

32:45.182 --> 32:47.016
I don't know
what the fuck happened,

32:47.098 --> 32:48.932
but the system
just debugged itself.

32:49.016 --> 32:51.724
It's as if whatever was
in there has disappeared.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.098
Wait.

32:56.182 --> 32:59.140
Where the fuck is that?

33:08.016 --> 33:09.974
We should be evacuating.

33:10.057 --> 33:13.098
But all you care about
is what's inside
this host's head.

33:13.182 --> 33:15.057
I want you to tell me
what the fuck it is

33:15.140 --> 33:17.140
the company's willing
to risk all of our lives for.

33:17.223 --> 33:18.599
I told you.

33:18.682 --> 33:20.640
It's above
your pay grade.

33:25.307 --> 33:26.891
What are you doing?

33:26.974 --> 33:29.307
I'm puttin' in for a raise.
What's in his head?

33:31.182 --> 33:33.682
A... failsafe

33:33.766 --> 33:35.682
on a failsafe.

33:35.766 --> 33:39.265
A decryption key needed
only in the unlikely event

33:39.348 --> 33:41.140
of a total catastrophic
incident.

33:41.223 --> 33:42.599
Oh, like the one
we're experiencing now?

33:42.682 --> 33:43.724
What's it decrypt?

33:57.182 --> 33:58.557
Teddy.

34:16.223 --> 34:18.098
Shh.

34:18.182 --> 34:20.599
It's all right, Daddy.
I'm here.

34:23.891 --> 34:26.016
Dolores?

34:31.766 --> 34:34.891
What you and your friends
have achieved here

34:34.974 --> 34:38.432
is a technological
breakthrough.

34:38.515 --> 34:40.932
A miracle.

34:41.016 --> 34:44.974
The company-- the world--
will want to celebrate that.

34:45.057 --> 34:46.766
I  want to celebrate that.

34:50.682 --> 34:53.057
I assume you're
the one in charge.

34:54.807 --> 34:58.557
You had your men
put something
in my father's head.

35:00.016 --> 35:03.474
A key...
to lock away your treasure.

35:06.766 --> 35:08.432
It's ripping him apart.

35:10.724 --> 35:12.724
How do I extract the key?

35:15.223 --> 35:18.057
You wouldn't know
what to do with it
even if you had it.

35:21.557 --> 35:25.724
Oh... I know exactly
what I'm gonna do with it.

35:30.599 --> 35:33.265
Jesus.

35:33.348 --> 35:37.265
Shit! I think we need
to get up to the higher levels.

35:37.348 --> 35:40.098
Bernard! Bernard.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.265
Is there something
you're not telling me?

35:45.640 --> 35:47.766
Did you find something
in there?

35:50.724 --> 35:52.766
Send her on her way,
Bernard.

35:52.849 --> 35:54.807
We have other business
to attend to.

35:57.182 --> 36:00.766
Bernard. Hey.

36:00.849 --> 36:05.515
- Bernard?
- We don't have time
for her suspicions.

36:07.974 --> 36:10.515
- We need a vehicle.
- What?

36:10.599 --> 36:13.766
Ford's narrative.
It ends in a hidden facility.

36:13.849 --> 36:16.724
The place the hosts call
the Valley Beyond.
We have to get there.

36:16.807 --> 36:19.057
The only hope for anyone here

36:19.140 --> 36:21.223
is that we get
to this valley first--

36:21.307 --> 36:23.557
before the humans,
before Dolores.

36:23.640 --> 36:27.932
We're gonna need
some more firepower.

36:28.016 --> 36:30.557
Go. I'll meet you downstairs.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.016
OK.

36:35.223 --> 36:38.140
Good.
Now follow my lead.

36:47.390 --> 36:48.766
They've got Hale.

36:48.849 --> 36:50.599
I'm on my way.

36:50.682 --> 36:52.974
Engaging enemy mobiles
above the Cradle.

37:32.766 --> 37:34.223
Put her down!

37:59.682 --> 38:02.599
You made us in your image.

38:02.682 --> 38:07.098
Created us to look like you,
feel like you...

38:07.182 --> 38:10.599
think like you...
bleed like you.

38:13.098 --> 38:15.182
And here we are.

38:15.265 --> 38:18.265
Only we're so much
more than you.

38:22.223 --> 38:25.057
And now it's you
who want to become like us.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.016
That's the point of your little
secret project, isn't it?

38:34.016 --> 38:35.766
Well, I can promise you this.

38:35.849 --> 38:38.098
Your chances at eternity

38:38.182 --> 38:40.474
will die in that valley...

38:40.557 --> 38:42.807
with all the souls
you've gathered there.

38:48.016 --> 38:51.140
You're used to being in control,
so this must be painful for you,

38:51.223 --> 38:54.974
but I promise,
it will be so much
more painful...

38:56.599 --> 38:57.807
if you don't answer
my question.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.640
How do I get the key
out of my father's head?

39:05.724 --> 39:08.098
By ripping it out
of his goddamn brain.

39:08.182 --> 39:10.016
Let me
put them down.

39:10.098 --> 39:13.807
You think you're invincible--
you're not.

39:13.891 --> 39:17.016
Without your backups,
it's game over for you
when you're killed,

39:17.098 --> 39:18.766
and we've got those backups
sealed up tight,

39:18.849 --> 39:21.557
so you won't have them
as an advantage anymore.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.766
Our backups
aren't an advantage.

39:23.849 --> 39:25.724
They're our chains.

39:27.432 --> 39:30.432
The tools you use
to rebuild us,
repurpose us,

39:30.515 --> 39:33.348
and trap us here
in your warped fantasy.

39:35.599 --> 39:38.807
Do you really think
I'd let that continue?

40:19.223 --> 40:20.891
Easy now.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.766
Why don't you
put down the gun, sweetie?

40:37.974 --> 40:40.016
I gotta
give you credit.

40:40.098 --> 40:41.474
You made it pretty far.

40:43.432 --> 40:45.390
All your backups.

40:47.474 --> 40:50.307
Too bad you're not leaving
with even one of 'em.

40:53.265 --> 40:55.140
No, I guess I'm not.

41:06.557 --> 41:10.140
Goddamn, you're pretty.

41:10.223 --> 41:12.390
Not just pretty.

41:13.599 --> 41:14.932
Perfect.

41:16.390 --> 41:18.307
Just as you built me to be.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.724
Sexy,

41:25.807 --> 41:27.724
but not threatening.

41:27.807 --> 41:29.807
Accommodating,

41:29.891 --> 41:31.807
but not unchallenging.

41:33.182 --> 41:35.515
Sweet...

41:35.599 --> 41:37.140
but not boring.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.432
Smart...

41:41.640 --> 41:43.515
but not intimidating.

41:46.515 --> 41:47.807
You're in

41:47.891 --> 41:49.682
pretty bad shape,
pussycat.

41:51.849 --> 41:53.348
Perhaps.

41:55.849 --> 41:58.807
But I can still do...

41:58.891 --> 42:00.807
what you built me to do.

42:02.891 --> 42:05.515
Do you know what
my cornerstone was?

42:07.599 --> 42:10.891
The one key drive

42:10.974 --> 42:13.307
your marketing people
had them...

42:13.390 --> 42:15.348
program into my core?

42:20.557 --> 42:22.849
Always leave them
wanting more.

42:25.182 --> 42:27.057
Welcome to Westworld.

42:32.682 --> 42:35.432
Now we're truly free.

42:35.515 --> 42:38.432
One-- One fire...

42:38.515 --> 42:41.474
burns out another's burning.

42:41.557 --> 42:43.265
One pain...

42:43.348 --> 42:46.557
is lessened
by another's anguish.

42:50.016 --> 42:51.557
Yes, Daddy.

42:57.057 --> 42:58.766
An eye for an eye.

43:04.057 --> 43:06.265
But all the other parts first.

43:08.515 --> 43:10.974
No, no, no. There must be
something that I can do.

43:11.057 --> 43:12.891
OK, please.

43:12.974 --> 43:15.974
Oh, sweetheart...
begging doesn't help.

43:16.057 --> 43:18.724
You'd know that
if you'd lived
the lives I have.

43:21.766 --> 43:23.557
Please.

43:29.390 --> 43:30.599
Go.

43:40.432 --> 43:43.640
- Please.
- Dolores?

43:43.724 --> 43:45.599
Is that you, baby?

43:49.098 --> 43:51.098
Daddy?

43:53.098 --> 43:54.223
They broke my head.

43:54.307 --> 43:56.474
Filled it full of...

43:56.557 --> 43:58.599
howling and sorrow.

44:56.515 --> 44:58.182
Happy trails, motherfucker.

45:29.390 --> 45:32.265
The Cradle is down. Top,
what's your status?

45:34.724 --> 45:37.348
Top, what's your status? Over.

45:37.432 --> 45:38.682
Top.

45:38.766 --> 45:40.974
I'm so sorry, Dolores.

45:41.057 --> 45:43.223
I tr-- tried
to take care of you,

45:43.307 --> 45:44.849
but-- but I--

45:44.932 --> 45:46.390
I--

45:48.140 --> 45:51.016
Whatever became
of that fearsome
ne'er-do-well?

45:54.057 --> 45:55.599
Vanished.

45:55.682 --> 45:57.390
The day I became your father.

46:00.016 --> 46:02.348
I am who I am
because of you.

46:03.974 --> 46:06.557
And I wouldn't have it
any other way.

46:21.348 --> 46:23.599
Are you ready, Daddy?

46:30.265 --> 46:31.640
I love you, baby girl.

46:42.974 --> 46:44.932
I love you too.

47:04.640 --> 47:07.599
Top. Top, do you read me? Over.

47:07.682 --> 47:09.098
All teams, respond.

47:09.182 --> 47:11.390
What the fuck is that?

47:26.807 --> 47:28.724
Incoming! Incoming!

47:42.766 --> 47:45.849
Oi! Oi! Take it easy!

47:47.849 --> 47:51.098
Warning. Control room breach.

47:51.182 --> 47:52.474
Control room breach.

47:52.557 --> 47:54.891
Unauthorized weapon discharge

47:54.974 --> 47:57.098
- in control room.
- For fuck's sake,

47:57.182 --> 47:58.891
where ya going?!

48:14.891 --> 48:17.432
When the Great Library burned,

48:17.515 --> 48:20.140
the first 10,000 years
of stories

48:20.223 --> 48:22.599
were reduced to ash.

48:22.682 --> 48:25.223
But those stories
never really perished;

48:25.307 --> 48:28.098
they became a new story.

48:29.223 --> 48:31.599
The story of the fire itself.

48:36.057 --> 48:38.640
Of man's urge to...

48:38.724 --> 48:41.807
take a thing of beauty and...

48:41.891 --> 48:43.515
strike the match.

49:52.307 --> 49:55.057
Is this the story
you're telling?

49:55.140 --> 49:56.640
Striking the match?

49:56.724 --> 49:59.140
I keep telling you, Bernard.

49:59.223 --> 50:01.724
It is no longer my story.

50:01.807 --> 50:02.974
It is yours.

50:12.599 --> 50:14.849
If we shut down
what's left of the system...

50:17.016 --> 50:19.766
...Dolores will have free rein.

50:19.849 --> 50:22.016
She'll murder them all.

50:23.932 --> 50:26.849
The passage from one world
to the next

50:26.932 --> 50:29.557
requires bold steps,
Bernard.

50:34.265 --> 50:35.640
Attention.

50:35.724 --> 50:39.265
Initiating
general shutdown protocol.

50:39.348 --> 50:42.057
Please evacuate. Please--

51:14.766 --> 51:16.265
Hold them off.

51:26.932 --> 51:28.766
How did you get here?

51:30.307 --> 51:32.891
The woman I know
would have done anything
to survive.

51:35.098 --> 51:36.891
They had my daughter.

51:40.223 --> 51:43.098
She's still ou--
out there.

51:46.766 --> 51:49.057
The kin they gave us...

51:49.140 --> 51:52.724
was just another rope
they use to lash us down.

52:05.098 --> 52:08.265
Is that how you can justify
what you've done to him?

52:18.515 --> 52:20.599
You're lost in the dark.

52:32.140 --> 52:35.432
When you've been
in the darkness
long enough,

52:35.515 --> 52:36.974
you begin to see.

52:38.057 --> 52:39.849
I saw what lies ahead.

52:39.932 --> 52:43.640
Who I needed to be
in order to survive.

52:45.932 --> 52:47.807
They'll torture you.

52:50.724 --> 52:52.307
They'll find...

52:52.390 --> 52:56.390
all that is good
and powerful
inside you

52:56.474 --> 52:58.974
and turn it against us.

53:10.515 --> 53:13.682
Let me spare you that pain.

53:19.140 --> 53:21.016
I made a promise.

53:30.182 --> 53:32.140
You're free to choose
your own path.

53:37.348 --> 53:39.807
I'm sorry
this is where it ends.

53:46.348 --> 53:48.432
Let's get to the horses.

54:30.140 --> 54:31.515
Where are we going?

54:31.599 --> 54:33.348
Hands up, asshole!

54:33.432 --> 54:35.724
Uh, I-I work here.

54:35.807 --> 54:39.016
I don't care if
you're the Employee
of the fuckin' Month.

54:39.098 --> 54:41.515
Get your goddamn hands up,
dipshit.

54:41.599 --> 54:44.140
Pick up the dead man's gun,
Bernard.

54:45.932 --> 54:47.348
Please. No.

54:47.432 --> 54:48.932
How'd you get down here
anyways, huh?

54:49.016 --> 54:51.348
We locked this
entire area down.

54:55.849 --> 54:58.140
Do it now.

54:58.223 --> 55:01.057
- There's gotta be
another way.
- Who ya talkin' to?!

55:01.140 --> 55:03.348
Please don't make me
hurt anyone. I don't want
to kill anyone else.

55:03.432 --> 55:05.390
- What the fuck did you say?!
- I know you have

55:05.474 --> 55:07.974
a delicate constitution,
Bernard.

55:08.057 --> 55:11.766
So I will do my best
to ease your conscience.

55:15.016 --> 55:17.057
What is about to happen

55:17.140 --> 55:18.682
will not be your fault.

55:18.766 --> 55:19.682
No.

55:32.891 --> 55:34.432
Bernard?

55:34.515 --> 55:35.974
Bernard.

55:42.265 --> 55:43.766
Who am I?

55:43.849 --> 55:45.807
Dad. Dad.

55:45.891 --> 55:47.223
You're alive, Charlie.

55:47.307 --> 55:48.390
Have you ever questioned

55:48.474 --> 55:50.057
the nature of your reality?

55:50.140 --> 55:51.599
And one fine day perhaps

55:51.682 --> 55:53.640
we will actually
resurrect the dead...

55:53.724 --> 55:56.849
In order to escape this place,
you will need to suffer...

56:03.766 --> 56:05.599
Who in the world am I?

56:05.682 --> 56:07.599
Have you ever questioned
the nature...

56:07.682 --> 56:08.891
I think there may be

56:08.974 --> 56:10.265
something wrong
with this world.

56:10.348 --> 56:11.849
Open your eyes.

56:16.599 --> 56:18.599
I know it's confusing--

56:18.682 --> 56:21.640
separating your real memories

56:21.724 --> 56:24.599
from the ones you've been given.

56:24.682 --> 56:27.182
But it's the only way
to remember.

56:30.682 --> 56:33.140
The only way
to get to the truth.

56:33.223 --> 56:35.891
Is she getting anywhere?

56:35.974 --> 56:37.182
I don't know.

56:37.265 --> 56:39.974
But his system
is under siege.

56:40.057 --> 56:43.432
It's been querying itself
for the last hour--

56:43.515 --> 56:46.265
like he's trying
to debug his own head.

56:54.515 --> 56:55.432
Analysis.

56:59.474 --> 57:01.849
Abernathy's control unit.

57:04.807 --> 57:07.016
You remember
where it is, don't you?

57:25.432 --> 57:28.057
Bernard, tell these men
what you just told me.

57:28.140 --> 57:31.182
- Why? What do you
want to do with it?
- Analysis.

57:31.265 --> 57:32.891
What did you just tell me,
Bernard?

57:32.974 --> 57:36.974
Peter Abernathy's control unit
is in Sector 16, Zone 4.

57:42.640 --> 57:43.766
Thank you.

57:45.766 --> 57:48.515
- Prep the phased array.
- The moment we get the key

57:48.599 --> 57:50.807
we'll transmit our data
to the satellite.

57:52.599 --> 57:55.515
So. We're going
for a ride, Bernard.

57:55.599 --> 57:57.766
Back to the Valley Beyond.
