WEBVTT

00:03.929 --> 00:05.262
DENNIS:<i> Okay, gather round,</i>
<i> everybody, gather round.</i>

00:05.264 --> 00:06.630
<i> Gather round, please.</i>

00:06.632 --> 00:08.432
<i> Yeah, I-I have</i>
<i> a, uh, a presentation.</i>

00:08.434 --> 00:10.267
Now, because of everyone's
A.D.D., I know I'm gonna

00:10.269 --> 00:11.835
lose your attention in
about three minutes,

00:11.837 --> 00:13.403
and, uh, Frank's
gonna fall asleep.
FRANK: No way.

00:13.405 --> 00:15.906
I slept 26 hours
last night.

00:15.908 --> 00:18.308
You still seem very sleepy.
Can I start my presentation?

00:18.310 --> 00:20.777
Where's the easel?
No, no, I'm not using an
easel-- don't interrupt.

00:20.779 --> 00:22.846
You want me to go get the
projector?
No, I don't want
the projector.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.681
And I don't want the easel.
What are you gonna point with?

00:24.683 --> 00:26.183
Don't want whatever the
hell you're gonna say.

00:26.185 --> 00:28.018
'Cause it's all gonna be old
and outdated, all right?

00:28.020 --> 00:29.786
Let me start my presentation,
which is actually about that.

00:29.788 --> 00:30.988
It's about innovation.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.156
Not taking questions.
Goddamn.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.092
Let me do my thing, okay?
Stop interrupting.

00:35.094 --> 00:38.996
Okay, so, um, as we all know,
um, tomorrow is St. Paddy's Day,

00:38.998 --> 00:40.764
traditionally our
most profitable day.

00:40.766 --> 00:44.134
However, recently, profits
have been declining.

00:44.136 --> 00:46.703
Every year.
And we need to change.

00:46.705 --> 00:48.338
We need innovation.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.007
We need to move Paddy's
from the past and into...

00:50.009 --> 00:53.010
the future,
a mobile Paddy wagon.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.778
Now, these days, people like
to have things on demand.

00:54.780 --> 00:57.180
So instead of having
to go to a bar,

00:57.182 --> 00:59.950
we will bring the bar to you.

00:59.952 --> 01:02.352
Ooh, is that, like, a car
service type of thing?

01:02.354 --> 01:04.354
Where we pick people up and
take 'em around from bar to bar

01:04.356 --> 01:05.856
and jack up the prices?

01:05.858 --> 01:07.657
That's actually
a really good idea.
Uh, no.

01:07.659 --> 01:09.659
The Paddy's wagon
<i> is</i> the bar.

01:09.661 --> 01:11.061
MAC: No, Dennis.

01:11.063 --> 01:12.462
If we want to make money,

01:12.464 --> 01:14.364
we need to honor ancient
Irish traditions,

01:14.366 --> 01:17.200
like serving an irresponsible
amount of booze to people

01:17.202 --> 01:19.169
who are genetically predisposed
to having alcohol problems.

01:19.171 --> 01:20.504
CHARLIE: Right.
MAC: You see,

01:20.506 --> 01:21.872
St. Patrick started
that tradition,

01:21.874 --> 01:23.340
and that's why we
celebrate him today.

01:23.342 --> 01:24.741
Yeah... No, that's
not what he did.

01:24.743 --> 01:26.710
No, he-he played
the flute for some kids,

01:26.712 --> 01:28.545
and then he lured them
into a cave somewhere,

01:28.547 --> 01:30.147
and he diddled them.
FRANK: Nah.

01:30.149 --> 01:32.716
You got him mixed up
with the Pied Piper.
Right.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.018
FRANK: St. Patrick didn't
play the flute.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.853
He drove the kids
out of Ireland.

01:36.855 --> 01:38.255
And then he molested 'em.

01:38.257 --> 01:40.390
No, no, if-if St. Patrick
molested kids,

01:40.392 --> 01:42.159
he would be regarded
as a scoundrel.
No, no, no.

01:42.161 --> 01:44.561
I feel like, in the olden days
of the Catholic Church,

01:44.563 --> 01:46.530
pedophiles were
regarded as heroes.

01:46.532 --> 01:47.998
All right, all right,
look, g-guys, uh,

01:48.000 --> 01:49.733
St. Patrick didn't do
any of that shit, okay?

01:49.735 --> 01:50.867
He drove the snakes
out of Ireland.

01:50.869 --> 01:52.269
Uh, I-I don't know
about all this.

01:52.271 --> 01:53.570
I kind of want to just do
the traditional thing

01:53.572 --> 01:55.072
of, like, sticking
around the bar

01:55.074 --> 01:56.706
and-and trying to catch
the leprechaun.
No, no!

01:56.708 --> 01:58.375
No, we don't want to do
the leprechaun thing again.

01:58.377 --> 02:00.377
Stop, stop, guys...
I'm gonna catch one.

02:00.379 --> 02:02.045
I'm, like, this close.
You're not gonna catch him

02:02.047 --> 02:03.780
because he doesn't exist.
Guys, please, just, plea...

02:03.782 --> 02:05.182
Dude, you know what...
I don't even know

02:05.184 --> 02:06.683
if I've set up
my glue traps for him yet.

02:06.685 --> 02:08.018
Charlie, enough
with the leprechaun!

02:08.020 --> 02:09.586
I mean, can you believe him?
Okay, wait.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.055
Who cares?
Look, I'm trying to...
You know what,

02:12.057 --> 02:13.924
actually-- I might
want to get myself a flute.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.625
I was thinking the same thing.
We've been talking... you were?

02:15.627 --> 02:17.394
Yeah, because I-I feel like
it's a really fun...

02:17.396 --> 02:19.096
DEE: I know we're
kind of old, but...
You're gonna go get a flute?

02:19.098 --> 02:20.430
Go get a flute, yeah.
Go get... go get a flute!

02:20.432 --> 02:22.032
Everybody go get a flute!

02:22.034 --> 02:24.134
DEE: ...in the sixth grade,
I feel like it's kind of simple.

02:24.136 --> 02:25.769
Frank, look...

02:25.771 --> 02:27.871
All right, let me
explain it to you, at least.

02:27.873 --> 02:29.106
(snoring)
No, he's gone.

02:29.108 --> 02:31.174
Okay.

02:56.802 --> 02:59.236
So, Frank... here's the plan.

02:59.238 --> 03:02.105
We're gonna fill the wagon
with hip, attractive clientele.

03:02.107 --> 03:04.007
We're gonna use my streamlined
system to process drink orders.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.475
We're gonna take photographs
with a retro filter

03:05.477 --> 03:06.943
for the Web site.

03:06.945 --> 03:08.812
And that will entice
future end users

03:08.814 --> 03:10.814
to comment
and spread brand awareness

03:10.816 --> 03:13.116
over various
social media platforms.

03:13.118 --> 03:14.784
That seems insanely complicated.

03:14.786 --> 03:16.786
Why don't we just take cash?

03:16.788 --> 03:18.155
No, no, no, no. What I'm talking
about's way simpler than cash.

03:18.157 --> 03:20.023
It's-it's streamlined.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.259
I'm lost.
It's... I'm trying
to explain it to you

03:22.261 --> 03:24.127
and I feel like
you're not even listening.
I-I...

03:24.129 --> 03:26.196
(Irish brogue):
Top o' the morning,
you filthy lads.

03:26.198 --> 03:30.133
I'm fixing to have a whale of
a time in this here mobile pub.

03:30.135 --> 03:31.468
I'm so sorry-- what is this?

03:31.470 --> 03:34.104
Crazy Paddy,
you big, dumb arse.

03:34.106 --> 03:35.805
(laughs)
Yeah. Why?

03:35.807 --> 03:38.008
'Cause it's fun.
No.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.976
I thought that's the thing
about St. Patrick's Day--

03:39.978 --> 03:41.778
people want clownery and-and
they want to embrace

03:41.780 --> 03:43.713
the Irish stereotypes.
No, no, no.
This isn't innovative.

03:43.715 --> 03:46.550
It's outdated and it's gonna
offend people.

03:46.552 --> 03:48.952
Well, I brought my piece in case
anybody gets out of line.
Oh, I...

03:48.954 --> 03:50.620
Okay, Frank, Frank,
look-- no guns.

03:50.622 --> 03:52.522
Let go.
No guns, no costumes.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.558
Okay, trust me,
I got this.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.359
Frank, you're gonna drive.
Drive.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.727
Okay, Dee, you're
gonna serve drinks. In the back.

03:57.729 --> 03:59.696
As a human being.
A real one.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.997
Mm.
Guys,

04:00.999 --> 04:01.998
I'm gonna provide...

04:02.000 --> 04:03.166
the experience.

04:03.168 --> 04:05.735
(Irish jig plays)
BOTH: Ooh.

04:05.737 --> 04:06.903
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, right?

04:06.905 --> 04:08.505
Yeah, I
like this.
Nice.

04:08.507 --> 04:10.640
I... See, I told you.
I know what I'm doing.

04:10.642 --> 04:12.075
Come on, let's go.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.510
Frank, you're driving.

04:13.512 --> 04:16.046
Okay. Here we go.
(engine starts)

04:19.751 --> 04:23.386
Ho! Check it out, Mac,
got some cool stuff.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.056
I got some green paint
and I found a snake.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.558
Great. Why?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.527
You know, the snakes, 'cause,
like, we... I don't remember

04:30.529 --> 04:32.429
where we landed on St. Paddy,
but I remember snakes

04:32.431 --> 04:34.731
were involved. And the green
paint's for the, uh, beer.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.933
Okay, love the snake.
Great catch there.

04:36.935 --> 04:39.035
But why not just use food
coloring for the beer?

04:39.037 --> 04:40.403
Uh, 'cause beer's not a food.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.172
When was the last time
you ate a beer?

04:42.174 --> 04:43.840
When was the last time
you drank paint?

04:46.511 --> 04:47.611
Have you been drinking paint?

04:49.514 --> 04:50.847
No.

04:50.849 --> 04:52.382
Let me see your tongue.

04:52.384 --> 04:54.551
Oh, my God, dude!

04:54.553 --> 04:57.721
Oh, that shit's
just disgusting!
It's not bad.

04:57.723 --> 05:00.023
You... you can't drink paint.
I know. I hear you,
I hear you.

05:00.025 --> 05:01.925
You say that, but I don't think
that you're gonna stop.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.060
Yeah, I get it, though, man.
It's, uh... Right.

05:04.062 --> 05:06.363
I-I feel like you're saying you
get it, but you don't get it.

05:06.365 --> 05:07.931
It's cool.
It's not cool.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.199
It is what it is.
Oh, my God,

05:09.201 --> 05:10.567
this is so frustrating!
Look,

05:10.569 --> 05:12.035
I'm gonna go down
to the basement

05:12.037 --> 05:14.204
and I'm gonna check
out my glue traps

05:14.206 --> 05:15.705
and see if I, you know,
got a leprechaun in there.
Wait, no, no, no, no.

05:15.707 --> 05:18.275
What... We said
no leprechaun this year.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.976
You're not chasing leprechauns.

05:19.978 --> 05:21.911
I know, and I kind of forgot
where we landed on that.

05:21.913 --> 05:24.214
I got these great cookie sheets,
they're filled with glue, so...

05:24.216 --> 05:26.249
But I-I hear you,
I hear you.

05:26.251 --> 05:27.984
It's a frustrating thing.
It's like the guy doesn't

05:27.986 --> 05:29.953
listen to us, man, when we're
trying to get through to him.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.521
It's a bummer.

05:35.227 --> 05:37.294
No, not you.
Keep moving, let's go,

05:37.296 --> 05:39.296
come on.
You kidding me?

05:39.298 --> 05:42.999
Oh, oh, h-hey-hey,
there, fellas.

05:43.001 --> 05:44.768
What's going on?
Where you going? You know what?

05:44.770 --> 05:46.970
Don't answer that.
Because I already know.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.672
You're going for a ride
in the Paddy's Wagon.

05:48.674 --> 05:51.141
Oh, cool. Is this,
like, a car service thing?

05:51.143 --> 05:52.842
Hey, can you take us
to Center City?

05:52.844 --> 05:55.111
No, it's not a goddamn car
service. Why does everyone...

05:55.113 --> 05:57.347
(Irish brogue): You get in that
wagon right now or I'm gonna

05:57.349 --> 05:59.349
sock you a good one
right in the kisser!

05:59.351 --> 06:01.484
(forced laugh)
Yeah, you dumb bi...

06:01.486 --> 06:03.787
What the hell
are you doing?
Uh, just innovating.

06:03.789 --> 06:05.455
I took the Paddy's wig
and I cut it

06:05.457 --> 06:07.357
into an awesome beard.
Great new character.
No.

06:07.359 --> 06:08.525
Hilarious.
You've just created another

06:08.527 --> 06:10.193
offensive Irish stereotype, Dee.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.162
The Fighting Irish--
i-it's true.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.363
I mean, that's
what Irish people do.
That is not what...

06:13.365 --> 06:15.031
They get drunk,
they fight people.

06:15.033 --> 06:16.132
All right, I'm trying to give
these guys... Look, guys,

06:16.134 --> 06:17.500
don't pay attention to her.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.968
I-I want to give you
an authentic, um, uh,

06:18.970 --> 06:20.704
once-in-a-lifetime
experience here.

06:20.706 --> 06:22.939
Oh. Oh, wait, so is
this, like, a bang bus?

06:22.941 --> 06:25.041
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not a bang bus, okay?

06:25.043 --> 06:26.543
Look... Just get in the wagon,

06:26.545 --> 06:28.311
I'll give you a ride
to Center City.

06:28.313 --> 06:29.913
Get in.

06:33.385 --> 06:35.185
DENNIS:
<i> Gentlemen,</i>

06:35.187 --> 06:37.387
let me walk you through how
our simple business works.

06:37.389 --> 06:38.888
God, take it easy,
Frank!

06:38.890 --> 06:41.157
Don't tell me
how to drive, you bitch.

06:41.159 --> 06:43.727
Let... Let's keep it light for
the customers, all right, Frank?

06:43.729 --> 06:46.129
As I was saying, fellas,
uh, what you're gonna

06:46.131 --> 06:47.497
need to do is you,
uh, you're gonna

06:47.499 --> 06:48.832
take a picture
of this QR code,

06:48.834 --> 06:50.400
you're gonna download the app,

06:50.402 --> 06:52.402
log in using Facebook,
and you're gonna watch

06:52.404 --> 06:54.504
a-a brief, 30-second
advertisement.

06:54.506 --> 06:56.806
And then once we receive
your online order,

06:56.808 --> 06:58.375
you will promptly
be served a beer.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.910
Can't I just pay you cash?
That's what I... Yeah.

07:00.912 --> 07:02.178
Well, no, cash is the way

07:02.180 --> 07:03.546
that antiquated
companies do business.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.981
Yeah, I just want a beer.
I don't really

07:04.983 --> 07:06.383
want you to have
all my personal information.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.717
"A beer.
Just want a beer.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.052
Don't want you
to have my..."

07:09.054 --> 07:10.587
(Dee and Dennis laugh)
Yeah.

07:10.589 --> 07:12.188
Look, man, um, if I
just gave you a beer

07:12.190 --> 07:13.590
and you just
gave me cash,

07:13.592 --> 07:15.058
then you wouldn't
be able to experience

07:15.060 --> 07:16.693
everything that we've
got to offer here, okay?

07:16.695 --> 07:19.229
Look, I'll show you. This...
Let me just pull up my...

07:19.231 --> 07:21.231
I got a little presentation
here that I put together.

07:21.233 --> 07:24.033
But, uh, can't get the goddamn
thing to... to go online.

07:24.035 --> 07:26.069
I don't have a signal here.
Goddamn it. You know what?

07:26.071 --> 07:28.371
Dee, uh, why don't you just
give 'em a couple free beers?

07:28.373 --> 07:29.873
We'll-we'll call
'em "freemiums."

07:29.875 --> 07:31.708
Don't know if you're
familiar with that term.

07:31.710 --> 07:34.611
This is like all foam.
Dee, you goddamn bitch!

07:34.613 --> 07:36.179
Hey! Oh, this thing's
bouncing around

07:36.181 --> 07:37.680
like a pinball.
Don't blame me.

07:37.682 --> 07:39.115
FRANK: Keep it light,
you bitch!

07:39.117 --> 07:40.784
All right.
Yeah, this is weird.

07:40.786 --> 07:42.585
Can we just get out here?

07:42.587 --> 07:45.422
Hey, it's locked.
Can you guys let us out?

07:45.424 --> 07:49.092
No, I'm not gonna
let you out.
Screw this.
I'm calling the cops.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.094
Yeah, call the cops.
Why would you call the cops?
We're just hanging out, man!

07:51.096 --> 07:52.629
All right, stop,
stop, stop.

07:52.631 --> 07:54.431
All right, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh. Push "end." End.

07:54.433 --> 07:57.467
(phone chimes)
Give the phones
to the girl.

07:57.469 --> 07:59.736
Let's go, guys. I don't want
to have to do this shit.

07:59.738 --> 08:02.372
Frank, we got to
pivot the business.

08:02.374 --> 08:04.307
FRANK:
Mm-hmm.

08:04.309 --> 08:05.642
Come on, get the hell out.
Everybody out.

08:05.644 --> 08:07.277
Out, out, out, out,
out, out, out, out.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.145
All right.
(clears throat)

08:09.147 --> 08:10.914
Don't worry. We're gonna mail
your phones back to you, but

08:10.916 --> 08:13.483
we're gonna need your addresses,
so fork over your I.D.s.

08:13.485 --> 08:15.118
Let's go.
Come on.
And their money.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.553
We can't have 'em
cabbing it back to the city

08:16.555 --> 08:18.087
and going straight
to the cops.

08:18.089 --> 08:19.756
(sighs) Goddamn it.
That's a good point.

08:19.758 --> 08:21.558
Okay, you know what?
Dee, collect their wallets.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.826
Don't worry, guys.
We're not thieves.

08:22.828 --> 08:24.227
You'll get your
wallets back, too.

08:24.229 --> 08:26.596
Yeah.
Don't be babies.
All right, uh,

08:26.598 --> 08:27.997
come on, come on, guys,
let's go, let's go.

08:27.999 --> 08:29.566
Let's go.
Shut the doors.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.107
Did we just kidnap
and rob those guys?

08:38.109 --> 08:40.176
We just drove the
snakes out of Philly,

08:40.178 --> 08:41.778
the way St. Patrick did.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.346
Oh!

08:43.348 --> 08:44.581
So, what you're saying is,

08:44.583 --> 08:46.349
technically,
we gave those guys

08:46.351 --> 08:48.585
a very authentic
St. Paddy's Day experience.

08:48.587 --> 08:49.986
Oh.
Yeah.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.588
Nice.
In a way.

08:51.590 --> 08:53.089
Oh. All right.

08:53.091 --> 08:54.991
That's good.
That's good.
Yeah.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Here.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.703
Jesus Christ, where's Charlie?

09:06.705 --> 09:10.473
Hey, Mac, somebody
stole my damn wallet.
What?!

09:10.475 --> 09:12.342
Beat it! Beat it, Mauricio!
I need to talk to Mac.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.810
Charlie, where have
you been, dude?

09:13.812 --> 09:15.545
I can't run the bar by myself
and do security.

09:15.547 --> 09:16.946
People are getting
their wallets stolen.

09:16.948 --> 09:18.448
Okay, uh, look, just come

09:18.450 --> 09:20.216
to the basement with me,
like, really quick.

09:20.218 --> 09:21.484
Goddamn it! All right.

09:21.486 --> 09:22.485
Attention, everybody.

09:22.487 --> 09:23.887
Irish honor system.

09:23.889 --> 09:25.788
Please serve yourselves.

09:25.790 --> 09:28.625
Put the money in the bucket.
Thank you.
(cheering)

09:28.627 --> 09:30.827
Uh, I don't think the Irish
honor system's a thing, man.

09:30.829 --> 09:31.995
Oh, it's a thing.

09:31.997 --> 09:32.862
It's an ancient
Irish tradition.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.163
Know your history, bro.

09:34.165 --> 09:35.431
What could possibly
be so important?

09:36.968 --> 09:39.502
Charlie...

09:39.504 --> 09:41.471
what the hell
am I looking at?

09:41.473 --> 09:43.306
(groaning and muttering)

09:43.308 --> 09:44.908
CHARLIE: I caught him.

09:44.910 --> 09:46.910
I caught that
son of a bitch.

09:46.912 --> 09:48.244
Dude, I think you've
kidnapped a little person.

09:48.246 --> 09:49.879
Huh?

09:49.881 --> 09:52.215
Nah... nah, nah.
First of all,

09:52.217 --> 09:53.816
I've captured
a leprechaun, okay?

09:53.818 --> 09:55.718
You wouldn't say,
"I kidnapped Bigfoot," right?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.420
You'd say,
"I captured Bigfoot."

09:57.422 --> 09:59.822
Well, that may be true,
but leprechauns aren't real.

09:59.824 --> 10:01.357
So what we're
dealing with here

10:01.359 --> 10:02.926
is a little person
in a glue trap.

10:02.928 --> 10:04.427
Yeah, I thought about that,
ruled it out, okay?

10:04.429 --> 10:05.929
'Cause the basement door
was locked, so unless

10:05.931 --> 10:07.597
he's a being
who's unrestrained by the laws

10:07.599 --> 10:09.566
of the physical world,
he's not getting down here, man.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.034
Dude, if he is
a human being,

10:11.036 --> 10:12.869
he is going to sue
the shit out of us.

10:12.871 --> 10:14.704
If he's a leprechaun,
he's got a pot of gold.

10:14.706 --> 10:15.905
Yeah...

10:15.907 --> 10:17.273
Well, yeah, that's...

10:17.275 --> 10:18.508
Well, let's not rule
one out over the other.

10:18.510 --> 10:19.909
I mean, it's very weird

10:19.911 --> 10:21.177
that he's
down here, right?

10:21.179 --> 10:22.779
MAC:
Okay. Let's ask him.

10:22.781 --> 10:26.516
Uh, sir, I'm gonna ask
you a direct question.

10:26.518 --> 10:30.420
Are you now or have you
ever been a leprechaun?

10:30.422 --> 10:32.922
No, I'm not
a goddamn leprechaun!

10:32.924 --> 10:34.591
Please...
It was pretty
convincing.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.359
Are you kidding me?

10:36.361 --> 10:38.461
If he's a leprechaun, that's
what he has to say, right?

10:38.463 --> 10:41.798
Sir, why are you dressed
like a leprechaun?

10:41.800 --> 10:44.233
'Cause it's St. Paddy's Day,
you idiots!

10:44.235 --> 10:46.869
This guy's good.
He's good.
Yeah.

10:46.871 --> 10:48.071
Nasty little son of a bitch,
isn't he? You think?

10:48.073 --> 10:49.973
There's, like,
a real bite to him.

10:49.975 --> 10:52.041
I know. You know what
I think we should do?

10:52.043 --> 10:53.743
We just rough him
up a little bit.

10:53.745 --> 10:55.378
You know, just get the truth
out of him, just a little bit.

10:55.380 --> 10:57.480
It's a great idea.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.415
We don't want
to bruise him up.
Yeah.

10:59.417 --> 11:01.985
You know, so, I just
wish we had, like,
a hose or something.

11:01.987 --> 11:03.553
Yeah.
You know, we could blast
the truth out of him.

11:03.555 --> 11:05.488
Right?
That'd be good...

11:05.490 --> 11:07.991
Oh, shit.
There's a hose right here.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.062
I... I don't ever remember
a hose being down here, do you?

11:13.064 --> 11:14.897
No. I don't know.
Dude...

11:14.899 --> 11:16.466
do you realize
what just happened?

11:16.468 --> 11:19.102
You made a wish, which
the leprechaun clearly granted.

11:19.104 --> 11:20.336
You know, everyone knows,
you capture a leprechaun,

11:20.338 --> 11:22.105
you get three wishes, right?

11:22.107 --> 11:24.307
So we got to think
very carefully what
our next two are here.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.476
I wish I could
live forever?
What are you doing?!

11:26.478 --> 11:28.177
I wish you don't.
How about that?
No, no! Why did you do that?

11:28.179 --> 11:29.345
Why did<i> you</i> do that?
Why didn't you say,

11:29.347 --> 11:31.247
"I wish I could live forever"?

11:31.249 --> 11:33.082
And live forever with you?!
Well...

11:33.084 --> 11:34.684
Look, I'm not a leprechaun!

11:34.686 --> 11:36.819
Just let me out of here,
you dickheads!

11:36.821 --> 11:38.254
Ah. Wish there was a way

11:38.256 --> 11:39.656
we could just know
for sure, you know.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.758
Charlie?

11:41.760 --> 11:44.794
Get the snake.

11:44.796 --> 11:47.964
DENNIS:
<i> You know what the problem was,</i>
<i> Frank?</i>

11:47.966 --> 11:51.034
That last group of belligerent
hooligans just didn't understand

11:51.036 --> 11:52.502
how to experience
our business properly,

11:52.504 --> 11:54.871
but I think this new group
is gonna get it.

11:54.873 --> 11:58.341
Plus, they're
physically weaker,

11:58.343 --> 12:00.343
in case anything
goes wrong.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.978
What's happening?

12:01.980 --> 12:04.013
(with Irish brogue):
I'll tell ya what's happenin'.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.015
One day you're young
and pretty,

12:06.017 --> 12:08.685
and the next, the years
of drinking and abuse

12:08.687 --> 12:10.820
have robbed you
of your youth.

12:10.822 --> 12:13.289
Abuse? Did these
guys hurt you?

12:13.291 --> 12:14.390
No!

12:14.392 --> 12:16.559
Me husband
did this to me.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.494
Arr!

12:18.496 --> 12:19.662
Dee...
Mm?

12:19.664 --> 12:20.997
What the hell
are you doing?

12:20.999 --> 12:22.398
What are you...?
What, are you a pirate?

12:22.400 --> 12:23.733
I can't tell if you're
doing a thing now,

12:23.735 --> 12:24.834
or if this is just
who you've become.

12:24.836 --> 12:25.902
(normal voice):
I'm giving them

12:25.904 --> 12:27.303
an authentic Irish experience,

12:27.305 --> 12:28.838
like you were begging for
before...

12:28.840 --> 12:30.406
You're giving them a
completely inauthentic,

12:30.408 --> 12:32.041
frightening experience,
and you're scaring them.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.177
Okay, listen, ladies,
nobody's gonna get hurt.

12:34.179 --> 12:35.411
Will you just let us out,
please?

12:35.413 --> 12:36.813
Well, no.

12:36.815 --> 12:38.214
No, I'm not
gonna let you out.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.682
I need you to
experience everything

12:39.684 --> 12:41.084
I-I have to offer,
okay, so you're...

12:41.086 --> 12:42.652
Rahr!
So, experience... Dee!

12:42.654 --> 12:44.487
Shut up!

12:44.489 --> 12:47.990
All right, look, we're gonna
have a good time here, okay?

12:47.992 --> 12:49.692
You're experiencing some
free beers right now

12:49.694 --> 12:51.394
because I can't get the
goddamn Internet to work.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.496
That's a problem for me.
Do you guys know how to use

12:53.498 --> 12:55.264
tablet computers?
You're young.
No.

12:55.266 --> 12:56.866
I just want to connect the
goddamn thing to the Internet.

12:56.868 --> 12:58.167
They told me it'd be easy.
It's not, though.

12:58.169 --> 12:59.936
Okay. Well, I'll
tell you what.

12:59.938 --> 13:02.271
I'll let you out after I take
a couple photographs of you.

13:02.273 --> 13:03.906
How's that sound? Yeah?
Take some photographs

13:03.908 --> 13:06.609
for my... for my Web site?
So, look happy.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.578
Look like you're having fun.
No need to cover those up.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.046
My customers like those.
They're like me.

13:10.048 --> 13:12.081
They're gonna
want to see that.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.583
Yeah, okay, so smiling,
smiling, and...

13:13.585 --> 13:15.551
(camera shutter clicking,
women crying)

13:15.553 --> 13:16.886
You're not convincing me.
Smile!

13:16.888 --> 13:18.254
(sobbing)
Goddamn!

13:18.256 --> 13:19.689
This is not
supposed to be scary.

13:19.691 --> 13:21.758
This is supposed to be an
authentic, fun time for you.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.193
(camera shutter clicking,
women crying)
Yeah, all right, well,

13:24.195 --> 13:25.628
I need to buy it, okay?

13:25.630 --> 13:27.263
I'm...
Please let us out.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.298
I don't want to be on
your weird Web site.
Shh.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.200
Well, if you don't comply
with me, then you're
gonna end up

13:31.202 --> 13:33.369
on the weird one, okay?
So, smile.

13:33.371 --> 13:35.738
(crying)
Ugh! All right.

13:35.740 --> 13:36.973
You know what?
This isn't gonna work.

13:36.975 --> 13:38.741
All right, come on, come on.

13:38.743 --> 13:40.209
Let's go. Come on.

13:40.211 --> 13:42.378
All right, out you go, ladies.
Out you go.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.946
I know you didn't
threaten to call the cops,

13:43.948 --> 13:45.448
but you would have--
I'm certain of it--

13:45.450 --> 13:46.816
so I'm gonna need
your wallets and your phones.

13:46.818 --> 13:48.584
Give 'em to the girl.

13:48.586 --> 13:50.753
Oh, yeah, I'm probably gonna
pop on your Twitter accounts,

13:50.755 --> 13:53.289
just so you know. Write us some,
uh, enthusiastic reviews,

13:53.291 --> 13:54.724
which you would have done,
as well,

13:54.726 --> 13:56.125
had you experienced
our business properly,

13:56.127 --> 13:57.493
but you decided to be...

13:57.495 --> 13:59.629
(sighs)
All right, well...

13:59.631 --> 14:02.131
(tires screech)

14:04.135 --> 14:07.136
Talk, bitch!
I'm blasting you! Come on!
Talk! Come on, leprechaun!

14:07.138 --> 14:09.138
Come on, leprechaun,
admit it!
Where's the gold?!

14:09.140 --> 14:11.007
Aw, what's the point, dude?
There's no water pressure.

14:11.009 --> 14:12.942
I feel like I'm
giving him a baby bath.
Yeah, I know.

14:12.944 --> 14:14.443
Snake's not
working either, man.

14:14.445 --> 14:16.279
Well, that's
because the snake is dead.

14:16.281 --> 14:18.014
Because you put it in a plastic
bag and it couldn't breathe.

14:18.016 --> 14:19.282
All right, doesn't matter.
He probably killed it

14:19.284 --> 14:21.317
with his leprechaun
magic, anyway.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.686
I'm not a leprechaun,
you goddamn assholes!

14:23.688 --> 14:25.688
Yeah, yeah, guy.
How are we gonna get
his pot of gold

14:25.690 --> 14:27.990
if he won't even admit to us
that he's a leprechaun?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.759
I mean, if this guy would
just admit he was a leprechaun,

14:29.761 --> 14:31.093
we could be done
with this whole mess.
Well, yeah.

14:31.095 --> 14:33.095
Of course.
Okay, fine, you got me.

14:33.097 --> 14:35.031
I'm a leprechaun.
I admit it.

14:35.033 --> 14:36.933
What?

14:36.935 --> 14:38.768
God... I am a... I'm a...

14:38.770 --> 14:41.437
damn... a... I'm a leprechaun.

14:41.439 --> 14:43.472
Yeah, right, but you
don't have the accent,
That's...

14:43.474 --> 14:45.708
and that's throwing
me off, right?
It's throwing me off.

14:45.710 --> 14:49.145
(Irish brogue):
I live in a faraway land,

14:49.147 --> 14:54.483
and I was transported here
by a giant magical rainbow.

14:54.485 --> 14:57.453
And you never got me
Lucky Charms.

14:57.455 --> 14:59.856
(laughing):
Oh!
That's it! That's it!

14:59.858 --> 15:03.059
You were right! Dude!
You caught a leprechaun!
I told you, man! I knew it!

15:03.061 --> 15:04.727
Hey, can you let me go now?

15:04.729 --> 15:06.329
No, you can't go. You know...
No. No.

15:06.331 --> 15:08.197
we need your pot of gold.
Where is it?
Yeah.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.868
It's at the bottom
of the rainbow.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.203
Hmm.
Must be some sort
of leprechaun riddle,

15:14.205 --> 15:16.205
'cause there's no
rainbows out today.

15:16.207 --> 15:19.742
No, dude... I don't think
this guy's talking in metaphors.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.245
I think he means
exactly what he's saying.
Yeah?

15:22.247 --> 15:23.913
Dude, he's talking
about that gay bar

15:23.915 --> 15:25.681
down on Locust Street--
the Rainbow.

15:25.683 --> 15:27.250
You know which one
I'm talking about, right?
No.

15:27.252 --> 15:29.085
Right. I'm gonna go
check it out, alone.

15:29.087 --> 15:30.386
Why?

15:30.388 --> 15:31.721
Well, because you'll be here.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.322
And if, uh,
the gang comes back,

15:33.324 --> 15:36.392
they'll also be here,
and I'll be there, alone.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.393
Right.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.262
But you'll be here.

15:39.264 --> 15:40.263
Great.
Great.

15:40.265 --> 15:42.398
All right, you go do that,
Okay. Yeah.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.166
and, uh, remember, you're there
to look for a pot of gold.

15:44.168 --> 15:46.202
Okay. Alone.

15:46.204 --> 15:47.536
Yeah. You'll be there, alone.

15:47.538 --> 15:49.438
Okay!
Got it.

15:49.440 --> 15:53.276
All right, well, that
just leaves you and me, and, uh,

15:53.278 --> 15:56.545
we both know there's no pot
of gold at that gay bar.

15:56.547 --> 15:58.915
So the question is...

15:58.917 --> 16:03.119
what to do with the little liar.

16:08.793 --> 16:11.027
We haven't made
a goddamn penny today.

16:11.029 --> 16:12.929
We actually lost money,

16:12.931 --> 16:15.431
with all the gas we burned
going back and forth.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.433
Yeah, well, it's not my fault.
The business model's flawless.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.201
If you knew how to drive
and you knew how to serve

16:19.203 --> 16:21.537
a goddamn beer, we wouldn't
be in this mess.

16:21.539 --> 16:23.906
(sighs)
Hmm.

16:23.908 --> 16:26.309
All right.
(grunts)
Mmm.

16:26.311 --> 16:29.312
Okay, everybody out.
Get out. Let's go. Come on.

16:29.314 --> 16:31.547
Go, go, go, go, go. You guys
are in the wrong demographic.

16:31.549 --> 16:32.882
Where have you taken us?

16:32.884 --> 16:35.284
Right. Yeah, I guess, uh,

16:35.286 --> 16:38.254
we got so used to our routine of
picking people up and dropping

16:38.256 --> 16:40.423
'em off outside of town
that we never even tried

16:40.425 --> 16:43.559
to sell you people beer,
did we? (laughs)
They're too old, anyway.

16:43.561 --> 16:45.594
Who's gonna watch
'em on a Web site?
That's true.

16:45.596 --> 16:47.997
Yeah, you guys are
a little too old for our, uh...
(woman shrieks)

16:47.999 --> 16:51.367
So...
Wallets and phones.
You know the drill.

16:54.272 --> 16:56.472
I don't know why we don't
just do the car service thing.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.241
People seem to be really needing
rides all over the town.

16:59.243 --> 17:01.944
No, you know,
that idea may work.
You think so?

17:01.946 --> 17:03.980
Thank you.
You're welcome.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.983
Oh. B-But before we
pivot to that one,

17:06.985 --> 17:09.318
um, Deandra,
you mind, uh, jumpin' out

17:09.320 --> 17:11.988
to see about the gas cap?
I think I left it off.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.023
Yeah.
(tires screeching)
Oop.

17:18.262 --> 17:20.363
Oh! Hey!

17:20.365 --> 17:22.431
Oh, goddamn!

17:22.433 --> 17:24.266
Goddamn it...!

17:24.268 --> 17:26.268
(groans)

17:26.270 --> 17:29.372
What you did there, Frank,
that was... very funny.
Yeah. That bitch

17:29.374 --> 17:31.440
was dragging us down.
Yeah.

17:31.442 --> 17:33.275
She was
driving me crazy, man.
Oh.

17:33.277 --> 17:35.845
Oh... shit.
What?

17:35.847 --> 17:37.313
She didn't put
the gas cap on.

17:37.315 --> 17:40.016
Oh, is it open for real?
Big-time.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.450
Oh, shit. Yeah, let me
grab that real quick.

17:41.452 --> 17:43.252
I got it.
(grunts)

17:45.156 --> 17:46.655
No, no, no, no, n...
Aw, goddamn!

17:46.657 --> 17:49.125
(groans)

17:59.037 --> 18:00.603
(sighs)

18:07.245 --> 18:09.211
I can't believe Uber
jacks up their prices
just because it's a holiday.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.813
That's unbelie... It's a scam.

18:10.815 --> 18:12.314
We should have been doing
that the entire time.

18:12.316 --> 18:14.383
Are you kidding me?
That was my whole idea.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.385
Dee, stop trying to take
credit for everything. Wait,

18:16.387 --> 18:17.820
what is going on in here?
Weren't Mac and Charlie

18:17.822 --> 18:20.222
taking care of the bar?
Yeah, they were.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.992
Why is the bar empty?
FRANK:
It ain't empty.

18:22.994 --> 18:26.228
What are you doing back here,
you piece of shit?

18:26.230 --> 18:29.031
It's a long story.
The business hit a wall,

18:29.033 --> 18:32.101
went up in smoke,
and then went under.

18:32.103 --> 18:34.003
Why are you speaking
in metaphors?

18:34.005 --> 18:35.871
It ain't a metaphor.
I fell asleep,

18:35.873 --> 18:39.341
crashed into a wall,
the engine burst into flames,

18:39.343 --> 18:41.343
and I had to drive it
into a river.
Right.

18:41.345 --> 18:43.345
(music playing in distance)
(muffled shouting)

18:43.347 --> 18:44.947
What the hell is that?

18:44.949 --> 18:46.882
♪ To keep this smile
from my face ♪

18:46.884 --> 18:48.617
♪ Losing control, yeah ♪

18:48.619 --> 18:51.754
♪ I'm all over the place ♪

18:51.756 --> 18:55.057
♪ Clowns to the left of me,
jokers to the right ♪

18:55.059 --> 18:57.259
♪ Here I am, stuck in
the middle with you... ♪

18:57.261 --> 19:00.262
Well, you may be a man.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.098
You may be a leprechaun.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.700
But only one thing's
for sure:

19:04.702 --> 19:06.235
you're in the wrong basement.

19:06.237 --> 19:08.070
(muffled):
Goddamn it! No!

19:08.072 --> 19:11.440
I'm gonna see if
you bleed green.
No! No! No, no, no!

19:11.442 --> 19:13.709
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Charlie,
Charlie, what the hell is...
Whoa, whoa. Hey!

19:13.711 --> 19:15.544
What are you doing?

19:15.546 --> 19:18.047
(music stops)
What does it look
like I'm doing?

19:18.049 --> 19:19.782
It looks like you've tied
a little person to a chair

19:19.784 --> 19:21.584
and you're gonna torture him.

19:21.586 --> 19:23.986
(chuckles) No, I've tied
a leprechaun to a chair,

19:23.988 --> 19:26.989
and, uh, yeah,
I was gonna cut him to pieces.

19:26.991 --> 19:29.592
Charlie...

19:29.594 --> 19:30.926
you been drinking
straight paint?

19:30.928 --> 19:32.261
Yeah.

19:32.263 --> 19:33.496
MAC: Charlie, he's
not a leprechaun!

19:33.498 --> 19:34.964
Do not hurt him!
I repeat:

19:34.966 --> 19:37.299
he is not a leprechaun!
Oh, hey.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.835
What is this?
Why are you covered in glitter?

19:39.837 --> 19:41.337
I would love to answer
all of your questions,

19:41.339 --> 19:43.172
but there is no time.

19:43.174 --> 19:45.608
You see, I went to the Rainbow
to look for a pot of gold.

19:45.610 --> 19:46.742
The gay bar?
Oh.

19:46.744 --> 19:48.144
Again, no questions.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.578
And when I got back,

19:49.580 --> 19:52.581
I found this bag...
full of wallets,

19:52.583 --> 19:54.316
hidden where we keep
the towels.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.417
Why did you need towels?

19:55.419 --> 19:57.419
Not answering questions, okay?

19:57.421 --> 20:01.090
Because apparently this son
of a bitch is a pickpocket.

20:01.092 --> 20:02.958
That's why he's been
lurking around Paddy's.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.794
Oh! Well, that makes a lot
of sense, 'cause he kept saying,

20:05.796 --> 20:07.997
like, "I'm a pickpocket. I'm
a pickpocket. Stop hurting me.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.665
I'm not a leprechaun." And
I just thought that was, like,

20:09.667 --> 20:12.434
a metaphor for, you know,
"I-I am a leprechaun."

20:12.436 --> 20:14.036
This little son of a bitch
has been picking pockets

20:14.038 --> 20:15.538
at our bar
every St. Paddy's Day

20:15.540 --> 20:17.106
for years.
FRANK:
Well, we got a whole bag

20:17.108 --> 20:19.542
full of wallets
and phones, too.

20:19.544 --> 20:22.378
You did? That's good. Because
the bar did not do so great.
Yeah.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.813
Turns out the Irish honor
system, that's not a thing.

20:24.815 --> 20:26.282
Yeah, we were gonna
actually return the wallets

20:26.284 --> 20:27.516
that we got, but, uh,
Yeah.

20:27.518 --> 20:28.984
since no one
seems to be...

20:28.986 --> 20:30.452
being honorable, uh,
maybe we keep our wallets

20:30.454 --> 20:32.054
and those
and, you know,
Yeah.

20:32.056 --> 20:34.690
chalk it up as a win. Yeah.
Oh, the luck of the Irish.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.892
(chuckling)
Let's not make it
a tradition, though.

20:36.894 --> 20:38.894
Sure.
Yeah, probably better
not to.

20:38.896 --> 20:42.865
All right, well, what do we do
with this piece of shit?

20:48.673 --> 20:51.106
(tires screech)

20:55.379 --> 20:57.880
(distorted laughter)

20:59.917 --> 21:03.652
Oh, shit, that leprechaun
just flew up a rainbow!

21:03.654 --> 21:06.222
Stop drinking paint,
Charlie.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.290
Huh.

21:44.295 --> 21:45.861
(trumpet playing off-key)

21:45.863 --> 21:47.296
<i> Brown.</i>
