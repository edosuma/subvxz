00:09.520 --> 00:11.192
Mom?

00:12.960 --> 00:14.678
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

00:14.840 --> 00:16.114
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.590
We got you, didn't we?

00:20.360 --> 00:23.238
Look. And Lois even made
her world-famous rum cake for you.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.674
From scratch.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.716
- Wow, I never would have guessed.
- You should have seen the first two.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.313
Come on, presents before cake.

00:32.479 --> 00:35.597
Come on, birthday boy. Sit down.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.434
Open it.

00:37.600 --> 00:38.874
Wow.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.475
Not that you're
the "dear diary" <i>type...</i>

00:47.640 --> 00:50.279
...but since you keep
everything to yourself...

00:50.440 --> 00:51.998
...I thought it might help.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.799
And since I'm on an intern budget,
I figured I could just...

00:55.960 --> 00:58.349
...comp a couple of those IOUs
that you owe me.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.553
Thank you.

01:07.720 --> 01:09.233
That's Dad's handwriting.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.359
I found it in his desk.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074

01:30.240 --> 01:32.993
Two tickets to the Wolverines game
in Milwaukee.

01:34.440 --> 01:38.956
- Right behind home plate.
- Yeah, your dad and his baseball.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.430
There was no one in the world
he'd rather watch a game with.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.029
Thanks for the tickets, Dad.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.717
I just wish...

02:00.880 --> 02:02.950
...that you were here to go with me.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.154
Dad?

02:19.080 --> 02:22.470
Listen, I'm sorry I couldn't be
at your birthday party...

02:22.640 --> 02:24.551
...to see the kind of man
you're becoming.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.472
- Dad, everything I am is because of you.
- Not everything.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.319
There can be no more lessons.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.439
You're gonna have to do this
on your own. I can't help you anymore.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.033
You're gonna have to stop him.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.634
Stop who?

02:38.800 --> 02:40.438
He's much worse
than we imagined.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.033
So many people...

02:42.800 --> 02:46.031
So many people are gonna die.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.316
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

02:49.520 --> 02:51.590
I'm talking about Lionel Luthor.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.234
What is he doing?

02:56.040 --> 02:58.156
He's gonna do something terrible.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.471
Tell me, Dad,
what am I supposed to do?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.877
I'm sorry, clark.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.315
But to save this world...

03:08.480 --> 03:10.994
...you've gotta kill Lionel Luthor.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.078
Goodbye, son.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.199
Dad?

03:20.760 --> 03:22.478
Dad?

03:22.840 --> 03:24.512
Dad, wait.

04:19.839 --> 04:23.276
Clark, grief can
play tricks on the mind.

04:23.440 --> 04:24.998
Mom, I know what I saw.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.311
It was Dad. His spirit, his ghost,
whatever you wanna call it.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.278
Sweetheart, I see your dad
all the time.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.749
Every morning when I wake up
I feel him beside me.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.639
But it's not him.
And it's not his ghost.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.792
It's my mind wanting it so badly
I think he's really there.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.155
Right now you're really angry
with Lionel...

04:42.320 --> 04:45.676
...and maybe you want someone
to say it's okay to get back at him.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.876
Mom, this isn't the first time
I've seen Dad.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.751
It's a long story,
but Lana was in trouble.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.276
I tried to save her and had
some sort of near-death experience.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.228
I saw Dad. He was the one
who told me Lionel knew my secret.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.473
That wasn't my imagination.
What if this wasn't either?

05:06.160 --> 05:08.993
If that's true,
if it really was your father...

05:09.800 --> 05:12.633
Then what Lionel's up to is worse
than just knowing my secret.

05:12.800 --> 05:17.476
It would have to be, for your father
to suggest taking someone's life.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.551
One drip, one extra-hot double cap,
no foam.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.472
- Sorry about the mess-up.
- Don't worry.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.790
I know how finicky
that steamer can be.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.679
- Thank you. Lois. Hey.
- Hey.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.832
- Running a delivery service?
- No. Actually...

05:36.000 --> 05:39.310
...Chloe started short-circuiting so l...
- Save it, Lana. It's okay.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.278
There's only one extra-hot double cap,
no foam in this town.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.759
Runs by "Lex."

05:43.920 --> 05:46.480
Walks in here like he owns the place.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.712
Actually, Lois, he does own the place.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.313
So are you his new assistant?

05:52.240 --> 05:54.800
No, not exactly.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.838
No way.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.275
I guess if you're in the market
for a boyfriend...

06:03.440 --> 06:05.556
<i>...why</i> not Smallville's
most eligible bachelor?

06:09.080 --> 06:10.672
He's not my boyfriend.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.999
Look, I know I'm not versed
in the whole girl-talk thing...

06:19.160 --> 06:21.071
...but I do have an unbiased ear.

06:21.240 --> 06:25.233
And, I know what it's like
to have a case of the bad-boy blues.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.477
Okay, Clark, I am the president
of Ghost Believers Anonymous...

06:34.640 --> 06:38.679
...but your dad Hamleting you?
- Chloe, I know how it sounds.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.118
- Hand me a cloak and call me Horatio.
- Great.

06:42.280 --> 06:46.159
Now what could be so bad that my Dad
would want Lionel dead to stop it?

06:46.320 --> 06:49.676
Maybe it has something to do with him
knowing where you really came from.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.434
That's a part of it,
but there's gotta be something more.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.033
Well...

06:54.200 --> 06:56.191
...if Lionel is hatching
some evil scheme...

06:56.360 --> 06:58.749
...it would explain why
he's sitting on your secret.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.672
Maybe something's already in motion.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.751
Chloe, someone tried
to blackmail my mom...

07:02.920 --> 07:05.434
...with footage of me using my abilities.
- What?

07:05.600 --> 07:07.511
Guess which billionaire
came to the rescue.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.158
All right, say this ghost
of your dad's is right.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.949
And we dig through Lionel's closet
and we find a smoking gun. Then what?

07:16.120 --> 07:17.758
- Depends what it was.
- Would it?

07:17.920 --> 07:21.435
Is there anything we could find that
would make Clark Kent kill someone?

07:31.240 --> 07:34.869
My helicopter's waiting, Dad.
What's so important?

07:35.040 --> 07:37.349
Obviously something
you've got cooking in Honduras.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.715
Although I doubt
it's the banana daiquiris.

07:39.880 --> 07:43.759
You've been racking up quite a lot
of frequent flier miles, son.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.876
Challenging upper management
often leads to a bout of unemployment.

07:49.040 --> 07:53.511
The welfare of your workers
is the least of my concerns.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.637
You're involved with Milton Fine.

07:59.800 --> 08:03.634
I know he's been smuggling the deadliest
viruses in the world into this country.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.711
- With your help.
- Well, don't worry, Dad.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.440
We're not gonna put them
in any Halloween candy.

08:09.800 --> 08:13.349
You're extremely nonchalant for a man
whose collection of microorganisms...

08:13.520 --> 08:15.909
...could wipe out
more than half of this country.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.350
It's under control.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.114
Your business partner's a man
who seems able to appear...

08:21.280 --> 08:23.475
...at opposite ends
of the Earth simultaneously.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.870
How much control
do you have over him?

08:28.960 --> 08:31.110
Your intel is impressive,
but incomplete.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.475
Shut the operation down, Lex.
Shut it down now.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.996
Wherever you're incubating
these viruses, you need to destroy them.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.590
Milton Fine embodies a threat
greater than you appear to realize.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.911
You taught me. Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

08:45.080 --> 08:48.311
This is one enemy you don't know.
Not knowing who you're in bed <i>with...</i>

08:48.480 --> 08:51.153
...can make for a very
uncomfortable awakening.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.910
Well, I'll present that nugget
to the board...

08:54.080 --> 08:55.991
<i>...when</i> they ask why I'm late.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.596
Wait, Clark, the alarm.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.035
I cloned the transponder
from Lionel's key <i>port...</i>

09:51.200 --> 09:53.555
...so we could override
the digital cipher.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.917
I need a night life.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.276
Look for anything my dad
might warn me about.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.759
Okay, it might take a minute.

10:01.920 --> 10:05.310
I can't exactly search for a file
called "My evil scheme."

10:06.320 --> 10:08.959
Have you thought that
if Lionel knows your secret...

10:09.120 --> 10:10.872
...he might have told...

10:11.640 --> 10:12.914
Lex?

10:13.920 --> 10:16.559
Knowledge is power.
Lionel would never level the field.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.392
I guess this is one rare time...

10:18.560 --> 10:21.791
...when we have to put our faith
in the Luthor family dysfunction.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.556
- Locked out.
- Check his calendar.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.870
All right.
I'm multitasking as fast as I can.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.515
- Leon Rowland?
- Who's that?

10:37.000 --> 10:40.197
Lionel has an interview tomorrow
with the <i>Inquisitor's</i> top reporter...

10:40.360 --> 10:42.271
...regarding something
called "The Weapon."

10:48.720 --> 10:50.438
Then at the Pentagon.

10:50.600 --> 10:54.991
Looks like the mysterious weapon
is the hot topic this week.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.798
Maybe it's not so mysterious.

10:58.280 --> 11:02.034
Wait, you think that you might be
the weapon Lionel's talking about?

11:22.560 --> 11:24.152
I bought us coffees.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.790
But after a three-hour conversation
with Lois, they got a bit cold.

11:29.320 --> 11:32.630
I can't wait to read all about Lex
and Lana in tomorrow's early edition.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.233
She's not like that.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.911
Believe it or not, she's a great listener.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.991
And with everything
that's been going <i>on...</i>

11:39.160 --> 11:40.957
...she's been a wonderful
outlet for me.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.354
It looks like I'm not the only one
who needs an outlet.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.554
Lana, something's happened.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.117
I've been wrestling with whether or not
I should let you in on it.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.952
But, when all is said and done...

11:58.120 --> 12:01.112
...you're the one person in the world
I can share it with.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.549
I've been working on something.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.509
Something bigger than either of us.

12:08.320 --> 12:12.074
- Lex, whatever it is, I trust you.
- This isn't about trusting me anymore.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.435
It's about trusting you.

12:15.080 --> 12:18.789
It's about how deep you wanna get
involved, and knowing when to say stop.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.595
Lana, what I'm about to show <i>you...</i>

12:29.760 --> 12:31.990
...means you're all in.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.037
A hundred percent.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.996
What is this place?

12:46.560 --> 12:48.232
The future.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.517
I'd like you to be by my side
when it arrives.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.716
You've been collecting viruses?

12:57.880 --> 12:59.518
The most deadly on the planet.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.238
What are you gonna do with them?

13:02.480 --> 13:04.232
Change the world.

13:06.080 --> 13:10.392
Lana, we've been able to
alter the viruses...

13:12.120 --> 13:15.635
...transforming them into
the ultimate vaccine.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.514
One shot of this, and theoretically
you'd be <i>protected...</i>

13:18.680 --> 13:20.796
...from any disease
that could be unleashed.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.871
Unleashed?

13:23.040 --> 13:24.473
By whom?

13:24.840 --> 13:26.558
Well, according to Fine...

13:26.720 --> 13:30.474
...the CIA believes the black spacecraft
might be the first of many.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.154
Listen, you need to keep this
between the two of us.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.709
Fine doesn't know
we're developing the vaccine here.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.435
I thought you two
were working together.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.079
Why don't you trust him anymore?

13:42.240 --> 13:45.789
Because I think he might be reporting
back to something a little higher up.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.992
You found the ship?

13:55.160 --> 13:58.596
I was tracking Fine
and he led me directly to it.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.751
But that's not the intriguing part.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.957
These two photographs were taken
a hundredth of a second apart.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.834
Where did he go?

14:11.320 --> 14:12.639
Oh, my God.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.234
Do you think he came out of that ship
like the others?

14:15.840 --> 14:17.831
That's why I was
going along with him.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.673
I thought I could buy some time
to find his weakness.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.910
But I'm starting to think
he doesn't have one.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.034
He might.

14:30.080 --> 14:34.039
After the meteor shower, when I found
your dad in that strange trance...

14:34.200 --> 14:37.397
...he grabbed me, and he told me
how to stop them.

14:43.960 --> 14:47.350
<i>Hi, this is the Kent residence.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

14:47.880 --> 14:50.235
<i>Martha, it's Lionel.</i>

14:50.400 --> 14:51.719
<i>I know things are strained...</i>

14:51.880 --> 14:54.838
<i>... but something's going on</i>
<i>that Clark needs to know about.</i>

14:55.000 --> 14:58.356
<i>Please. Call me</i>
<i>as soon as you get this.</i>

15:14.520 --> 15:16.397
Jonathan.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.957
How long, Martha?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.233
What?

15:24.400 --> 15:26.914
How long have you had feelings
for Lionel Luthor?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.718
It's not like that.

15:32.720 --> 15:35.792
I want you to be happy, sweetheart.
I've always <i>just...</i>

15:36.120 --> 15:37.553
Just wanted you to be happy...

15:40.520 --> 15:42.476
...but not with him.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.198
Jonathan.

15:49.560 --> 15:53.269
You know you're the only man
I've ever loved.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.717
It's <i>been...</i>

15:58.320 --> 16:00.356
...so hard without you.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.954
Your voice, your touch.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.558
I miss you so much.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.711
I miss you too, sweetheart.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.870
Why did you have to leave me?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.592
I'm sorry, Martha.
I didn't have any choice.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.672
And soon, neither will a lot of other
innocent people.

16:27.960 --> 16:31.236
Are you talking about Lionel?
What is it? What is he doing?

16:31.400 --> 16:34.551
He's going to drown you all
in your own blood.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.278
Just like he did me.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.148
Like he did you? What...?

16:41.080 --> 16:45.517
Martha, I'm sorry. But, you've got to
tell Clark there is no other choice.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.828
Lionel Luthor has to die.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.473
Jonathan.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.632
He has to.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.952
Jonathan?

17:20.079 --> 17:22.958
He was standing right here.
Like he was still alive.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.236
He said Lionel was gonna
drown us all in blood.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.867
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.829
Mom, I think it might have something to
do with Lionel using me as a weapon.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.150
But, Clark, you would never
go along with that.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.958
What if he found a way
to control me?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.917
Maybe that's what Dad's
come to stop.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.472
All this time I thought Lionel
was making up for his past.

17:41.640 --> 17:42.959
Mom, it's not your fault.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.917
Lionel has been manipulating all of us.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.874
Clark, he said something else.

17:50.240 --> 17:54.995
I think he meant Lionel
had something to do with his death.

18:03.080 --> 18:06.072
<i>We've tracked Milton Fine</i>
<i>to the Midwestern United States.</i>

18:06.240 --> 18:08.959
<i>We're working to narrow</i>
<i>his coordinates. We'll let you know.</i>

18:09.320 --> 18:12.790
<i>- Sir, please be advised unofficial data...</i>
- Good evening, Mr. Luthor.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.437
May I?

18:15.760 --> 18:18.035
Please, help yourself.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.679
Everybody else does.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.915
Some say the toast came about...

18:23.080 --> 18:27.073
...by a man who feared
that his drink had been poisoned.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.356
But he was a quick-witted man.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.433
He joyfully clanked his mug
with the mugs of his mates...

18:34.600 --> 18:38.798
...sloshing his lethal beverage
into everyone's drink with cheer.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.153
A simple tap, then,
must be a sign of trust.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.832
I'm not really thirsty.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.959
I thought we had an agreement.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.110
You would inform me
of the virus's progress.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.875
But I seem to be
shockingly cut out of the loop.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.474
A fact you've probably
known for weeks.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.997
Come on.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.754
You must have assumed
I wouldn't inherently <i>believe...</i>

19:24.920 --> 19:26.194
...your CIA bluff.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.548
And that's why I chose you.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.393
For your insatiable distrust...

19:31.560 --> 19:34.074
...and your propensity
for covering all the bases.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.918
I'm sure you didn't waltz in <i>here...</i>

19:37.080 --> 19:40.197
- ...thinking I'd just roll over.
- No, not you.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.996
Not without a bone.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.276
I'll take the truth.

19:46.160 --> 19:49.994
I assure you the vaccine
is processed and ready.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.669
But I'd be foolish to hand it over
to someone...

19:52.840 --> 19:54.990
...whose agenda is still up for grabs.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.953
Lex, it's a vaccine.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.509
What threat could it possibly pose?

19:59.680 --> 20:03.434
Now, that's a question
I've been asking myself for weeks.

20:12.680 --> 20:15.513
I'm hoping this will help me
get a few answers.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.595
Close...

20:22.760 --> 20:24.352
<i>...but</i> I'm not one of them.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.316
I was only made by them.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.310
Where's the vaccine?

20:40.360 --> 20:42.794
Before I tell you this,
promise you'll keep <i>cool...</i>

20:42.960 --> 20:45.520
...and backburner those
<i>American Psycho</i> instincts, okay?

20:45.680 --> 20:47.716
Chloe, what is it?

20:48.600 --> 20:50.318
I pulled up your dad's phone records.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.675
Unless Lionel was selling
long-distance plans...

20:52.840 --> 20:55.035
...he was desperate
to get ahold of your dad.

20:55.200 --> 20:59.034
There are at least 20 calls logged
in those last few weeks.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.878
Dad said he died
protecting my secret.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.838
Maybe that's how he found out
Lionel knew about me.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.996
When did the calls stop?

21:08.040 --> 21:09.792
They didn't.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.793
Lionel talked to your dad
an hour before he died.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.678
Think Lionel was congratulating him?

21:17.120 --> 21:19.475
Not unless he did it in person.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.029
Lionel's call came through a tower
in Jansen's Field.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.191
That's only a mile away
from your house.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.351
Lionel was there?

21:30.440 --> 21:33.238
Lionel was there
the night my dad died.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.034
Clark.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.392
I'm glad you called. Thank you.
We don't have much time.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.759
Is this where it happened?

22:04.360 --> 22:06.635
Is this where you met my father
the night he died?

22:07.720 --> 22:09.392
Yes. Yes, it is.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.110
I had to talk to him. It was important.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.311
He found out, didn't he?

22:22.920 --> 22:25.593
He found out about your plan
to use me as a weapon.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.034
A weapon?

22:27.200 --> 22:30.749
No. Clark, no, it...

22:33.760 --> 22:35.591
What did you do to him?

22:35.760 --> 22:37.557
Clark, I wanted to help him.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.393
He needed an ally
but he took it the wrong way.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.556
- You killed my father.
- No. Clark...

22:43.720 --> 22:45.995
What happened, he wouldn't
go along with the plan?

22:46.640 --> 22:48.949
You pushed. You pushed him
till his heart gave out.

22:49.120 --> 22:51.839
- Listen to me, Clark.
- I will never be anyone's weapon.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.275
- You're not the weapon. It's not you.
- Lies.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.710
That's all he's gonna tell you, son.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.235
Gonna have to kill him
before he gets the chance.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.834
- Listen to me, Clark.
- Shut up!

23:03.000 --> 23:04.877
Do it, Clark.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.911
Do it.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.832
- You killed him.
- Yes, he killed me.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.433
So go on, son. Avenge my death.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.716
Your father would never
make you a murderer.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.114
Kill him!

23:19.480 --> 23:22.790
Listen to me, Clark. Listen to me.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.235
Clark, I know this
is very difficult for you...

23:25.400 --> 23:27.630
...but you have
got to kill Lionel Luthor!

23:35.040 --> 23:36.951
Clark Kent, kill him now!

23:46.000 --> 23:47.513
You know...

23:48.200 --> 23:52.557
...I asked you to do one simple thing.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.676
This is what I get.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.472
You're a tremendous
disappointment to me, son.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.712
You're not my father.

24:03.880 --> 24:07.919
Well, it looks like I might have
underestimated you, Kal-EI. Catch!

24:30.360 --> 24:35.912
It would be so easy to snap your neck
just like a twig.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.435
But I still need you.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.192
Who are you?

24:40.360 --> 24:43.989
I'm the guy that's gonna help
bring this world to its knees.

24:54.560 --> 24:58.394
Don't touch me.
Don't do it. Don't do...

25:16.360 --> 25:19.318
What...? What just happened?

25:26.720 --> 25:29.109
I was fairly certain Milton Fine
was a Kryptonian...

25:29.280 --> 25:31.350
<i>...but</i> I didn't realize
that shape shifting...

25:31.520 --> 25:34.034
<i>...was</i> one of the Kryptonian's
miraculous abilities.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.633
It isn't.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.719
Then Fine's not a Kryptonian.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.949
Clark, it is important to both of us
that we keep this from Lex.

25:47.080 --> 25:51.517
Look, Fine was created by Kryptonians,
and he's already been destroyed twice.

25:51.680 --> 25:55.036
Twice? Some sort of self-replicating
entity, it's incredible.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.668
That's one word for it.
Why was he so afraid of you?

25:59.360 --> 26:02.238
And how were you able to destroy him,
just by touching him?

26:02.400 --> 26:04.914
L... I'm not sure. But...

26:08.760 --> 26:13.356
I feel the answers
could lie somewhere...

26:13.920 --> 26:15.194
...in here.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.476
Where did you find all this?

26:29.920 --> 26:31.194
I didn't find it.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.033
I wrote it.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.838
And whatever voice I'm <i>channeling...</i>

26:42.000 --> 26:46.232
...I believe that what I wrote
is meant for you.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.669
So hell freezes over
and no one bothers to tell me?

27:07.840 --> 27:10.434
Chloe, listen.
Mr. Luthor has been writing these.

27:10.600 --> 27:13.273
Seems to be some sort of warning,
but I can't decipher it.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.594
Unfortunately my Kryptonian's rusty.
What about...?

27:19.760 --> 27:22.991
I don't know what any of this means.
I am simply the oracle.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.313
The answers could be found
with a visit to your Fortress.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.750
Last time someone talked me
into taking them...

27:30.920 --> 27:34.117
...it was a trick to release General Zod.
- I have plans this weekend.

27:34.280 --> 27:38.114
So if we could protect Smallville
from Krypton's deadliest villain, great.

27:38.280 --> 27:41.192
Ancient hieroglyphics were deciphered
by finding repeated...

27:41.360 --> 27:42.793
Repeated patterns. I know.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.315
So let me scan this
and see if we got any.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.117
Why would Fine wanna
expose himself now?

27:49.280 --> 27:50.872
He's afraid I'm going to help you.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.515
To stop what he and Lex
are planning to do.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.716
- Which is what?
- Fine has been helping Lex...

27:55.880 --> 28:00.749
...to develop a virus so lethal, it could
bring humanity to the brink of extinction.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.593
LuthorCorp scientists
completed the project today.

28:04.760 --> 28:08.309
So the weapon isn't clark,
it's this virus.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.479
Yes.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.756
What the pattern
is trying to warn me against.

28:12.920 --> 28:16.549
I have a strong sense that this warning
I have been entrusted to pass on...

28:16.720 --> 28:19.951
...is related to something more terrible
even than the virus.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.593
- Maybe the virus is just a part of it.
- Yeah.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.599
- Do you have access to the lab?
- I don't know where it is.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.512
I think we know someone who does.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.998
What are you doing?

28:55.160 --> 28:56.479
Smooth one, Smallville.

28:57.080 --> 29:00.834
- Something I have to talk to you about.
- How did you get in here?

29:02.920 --> 29:06.879
I think I just heard a keg being tapped.
I'm gonna go check it out.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.351
I shouldn't be going through
your stuff...

29:10.520 --> 29:12.590
<i>...but</i> you're involved
in something dangerous.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.990
Worried I'm involved in it,
or in it with Lex?

29:17.080 --> 29:20.675
No. Lana, this has nothing to do
with my feelings.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.752
Lex doesn't know what he's gotten
himself into. Neither do you.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.832
You break into my place
and you expect me to believe anything?

29:28.160 --> 29:29.639
Lex is in trouble.

29:29.800 --> 29:33.190
And if you care about him at all,
you'll tell me where that lab is.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.510
Before it's too late.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.552
Impressive.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.836
Looks like I underestimated
your willingness...

29:45.000 --> 29:47.116
...to tackle a non-profit venture.

29:47.280 --> 29:51.558
Well, Luthorcorp doesn't take the threat
of an alien Armageddon lightly.

29:52.440 --> 29:55.716
You were never gonna create
a vaccine for humans, were you?

29:55.880 --> 29:57.552
Is that what you think?

29:58.080 --> 30:01.868
It was gonna be your way of protecting
extraterrestrial guests when they arrive...

30:02.040 --> 30:04.190
...and unleash
some horrible disease on us.

30:04.360 --> 30:08.194
So you went behind my back,
mass-produced the vaccine for mankind.

30:13.760 --> 30:17.799
I wanted to give my people a chance
before you got your dirty hands on it.

30:17.960 --> 30:23.592
I applaud your noble efforts
to protect your species.

30:24.200 --> 30:28.318
Unfortunately, it's all based
on faulty assumptions.

30:32.800 --> 30:36.679
I never intended
to mass-produce the vaccine.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.109
One dose is all I ever needed.

30:43.320 --> 30:46.312
Let the rest of the world
find its own cure.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.791
I'm not sure
what to tell you, Mr. Luthor.

31:32.960 --> 31:36.396
Whatever you were injected with,
it doesn't appear to have had any effect.

31:36.560 --> 31:39.074
In fact, you've never been healthier.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.789
Well, I appreciate the vote of confidence.
Thank you, doctor.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.837
Are you okay?

31:52.760 --> 31:54.318
Yeah.

31:54.840 --> 31:58.913
So I'm guessing that my father told you
everything that happened at the lab.

31:59.280 --> 32:02.192
You know, Lex, if you had listened
to your father's <i>warnings...</i>

32:02.360 --> 32:05.796
...none of this would have happened.
- None of what?

32:05.960 --> 32:07.837
All the viruses were destroyed.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.390
And now LuthorCorp has a technology
to create an extraordinary vaccine.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.752
Lex, you were double-crossed.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.236
- Where's Fine right now?
- I don't know.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.994
My operatives are scouring the globe.

32:24.160 --> 32:27.596
Clark, I was the good guy here.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.832
LuthorCorp spent over $ 10 million
producing that vaccine.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.516
One more thing, Clark.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.639
Lana called me.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.560
I don't wanna hear you were
rifling through her stuff...

32:43.720 --> 32:45.551
...like a crazy roommate again.

32:45.720 --> 32:49.508
If you want something from me,
don't go running to Lana to find it.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.710
You really crossed the line.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.030
All those years we were friends...

32:59.160 --> 33:02.357
...were you waiting for me to step aside
so you could make your move?

33:02.880 --> 33:04.836
I don't know, clark.

33:05.760 --> 33:08.433
All those years
you told Lana you loved her...

33:08.600 --> 33:12.036
...were you just waiting to walk away
and break her heart?

33:12.800 --> 33:15.837
There's a natural tendency to blame
the person who's replaced you.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.399
I get that.

33:17.880 --> 33:20.440
But I didn't take Lana from you.

33:20.840 --> 33:23.400
You lost her all by yourself.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.632
Lionel?

33:49.800 --> 33:51.392
What are you doing here?

33:52.440 --> 33:56.353
I have to make
a confession to you, Martha.

34:10.840 --> 34:15.311
Martha, the...
The night Jonathan was elected...

34:15.480 --> 34:18.630
...l... I called him.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.431
So it's true.

34:22.600 --> 34:27.754
I told him that I knew everything
about Clark.

34:30.480 --> 34:33.199
He was so angry, he...

34:39.600 --> 34:41.351
He never let me explain.

35:05.440 --> 35:09.956
I wish I had a heart as full of strength
and goodness as your son, Martha.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.710
I don't.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.955
But I want you to remember
that I was at least honest with you.

35:24.840 --> 35:28.310
In time, maybe you'll
be able to forgive me.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.189
I'm sorry if things got awkward.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.510
I was hoping Clark
wouldn't end up in all this.

35:48.680 --> 35:52.389
- I just don't wanna hurt him.
- I don't either.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.959
I care about him too.

35:56.600 --> 35:58.909
But then I have to remind myself...

35:59.080 --> 36:02.356
<i>...that</i> clark's specialty
is barging in where he's not <i>invited...</i>

36:02.520 --> 36:06.832
...and then somehow making you feel
like you're the one who should apologize.

36:09.280 --> 36:13.353
Okay, I have a great idea.

36:13.520 --> 36:16.796
How about a moratorium
on the Clark topic?

36:18.520 --> 36:20.238
Twist my arm.

36:20.400 --> 36:22.391
Don't tempt me.

36:26.040 --> 36:29.077
You know,
I still can't make sense of all this.

36:29.240 --> 36:33.756
Why would you be asked to produce a
super vaccine just to have it destroyed?

36:34.560 --> 36:35.913
I don't know.

36:36.080 --> 36:38.958
But then again,
I think like a red-blooded human.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.395
Well, he was obviously
preparing for something.

36:46.560 --> 36:47.834
What happened?

36:50.760 --> 36:52.034
What happened?

36:56.280 --> 36:58.032
Are you okay?

36:59.480 --> 37:01.038
Yeah.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.236
Never better.

37:20.120 --> 37:23.317
I thought you'd be outside Lana's dorm
with your binoculars by now.

37:29.320 --> 37:32.198
I appreciate the concern.
Lana and I are none of your business.

37:32.360 --> 37:36.638
Please, Smallville, I've had three exes
put under military surveillance.

37:36.800 --> 37:41.078
I'm hardly qualified to dish out
post-relationship tact.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.393
But it's time for some tough love.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.033
Lana's going to move on.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.790
She already has.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.996
With Lex.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.071
And it sucks.

38:00.240 --> 38:02.993
But you gotta trust your gut
that you did this for a reason.

38:03.160 --> 38:07.438
Whatever reasons guys have for dumping
hot, smart, fun girls these days.

38:09.160 --> 38:12.197
Look, give her some space.
Your whole night-stalker routine...

38:12.360 --> 38:15.352
...that is gonna ruin any of the
good feelings Lana has for you.

38:15.520 --> 38:16.999
If there are any.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.394
Look...

38:20.200 --> 38:24.591
...sometimes you gotta tuck your
feelings away until it's the right time.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.590
Like stuffing dollars into a piggy bank
for a bike you can't quite afford.

38:30.480 --> 38:33.074
Except, I can't imagine
there is anyone else out there.

38:33.240 --> 38:36.710
You never know, Clark. Maybe when you
finally crack open that piggy bank...

38:36.880 --> 38:39.838
...you'll find that
you haven't been saving for a <i>bike...</i>

38:40.000 --> 38:42.150
...you've really been saving
for a Harley.

38:45.760 --> 38:48.957
There are times when I think
you don't know me at all.

38:49.680 --> 38:52.069
Others where I think
you know me better than anyone.

38:53.640 --> 38:58.236
Well, that's what I'm here for,
Smallville, one save at a time.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.754
And speaking of saving things...

39:01.920 --> 39:03.353
- My cake.
- Hello.

39:03.520 --> 39:08.355
Your mom thought we might wanna
share some of the leftover birthday cake.

39:10.960 --> 39:16.114
Well, I'm sure there's a goat on this farm
that will appreciate my knack for batter.

39:19.720 --> 39:23.076
You handled the whole party
thing really well, by the way.

39:23.240 --> 39:25.231
Thanks.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.948
The baseball tickets...

39:29.120 --> 39:30.758
...they hit me harder
than I thought.

39:31.960 --> 39:34.918
Yeah, but those tickets,
they weren't your dad's only gift.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.913
I mean, it didn't come with a big,
pretty red bow...

39:41.080 --> 39:43.150
...but your dad raised you
to be your own man.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.476
That was his real gift.

39:46.040 --> 39:48.270
And he gave that to you every day.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.154
I thought you just came
to get tipsy off of rum cake.

39:55.320 --> 39:59.950
Yeah. Actually, I came by
for your Kryptonian dictionary.

40:00.800 --> 40:05.316
I ran Lionel's symbols in that program
and it came up with this pattern.

40:05.480 --> 40:08.278
Three signs repeated 32 times.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.079
What does it say?

40:19.440 --> 40:22.000
"Zod is coming."
