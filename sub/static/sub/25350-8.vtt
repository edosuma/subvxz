WEBVTT

00:10.911 --> 00:14.312
He's extremely physical
and hates women.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.648
This is not a happy,
peaceful house.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.983
The house is gonna kill me.

00:18.985 --> 00:21.853
He says, "If she is not
already dead, she will be soon."

00:24.457 --> 00:26.257
I mean, she thinks something
here is trying to kill her.

00:26.259 --> 00:29.928
It's kind of disheartening.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.197
They're being possessed.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.867
If I have to fight this thing
to my death,

00:35.869 --> 00:38.937
I know where I'm going.

00:38.939 --> 00:44.009
I would not want to die
anywhere near this place.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.478
And I just feel fear.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.479
My name is Amy Allan.

00:48.481 --> 00:49.547
This is like

00:49.549 --> 00:51.750
Grand Central Station
for the dead.

00:51.752 --> 00:52.951
I see dead people.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.153
They have pain
that they suffered.

00:55.155 --> 00:57.022
I speak to dead people.

00:57.024 --> 00:59.891
She hates them, hates them.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.293
And they speak to me.

01:02.295 --> 01:05.764
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.031
It's a demon.

01:07.033 --> 01:09.167
It's Satan.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.768
I rely on my partner.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.304
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.573
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.907
What was the body count?
What happened?

01:15.909 --> 01:19.578
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.979
I don't know
if it's a demon or not

01:20.981 --> 01:22.514
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.116
It's my job to reveal them.

01:24.118 --> 01:26.718
I feel like I'm crazy.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.587
But Steve and I never speak...

01:28.589 --> 01:30.655
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.056
...until the very end.

01:32.058 --> 01:33.991
I want to show you this.

01:33.993 --> 01:36.194
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.597
I just don't want anything
to happen to my mother.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.165
Or time to get out.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.800
You have to get out.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.682 --> 01:58.083
So I'm back out here
in Springfield, Ohio.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.552
It's about 30 minutes
outside of Dayton.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.620
I got a call from a woman
named Sharon.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.290
Now she's been living
with activity in her house

02:05.292 --> 02:06.758
for over 20 years.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.894
But recently it turned
violent and dangerous.

02:09.895 --> 02:12.230
She says it's threatening
her health, her safety,

02:12.232 --> 02:16.234
and her life.

02:16.236 --> 02:20.839
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

02:20.841 --> 02:24.443
Photographs, trophies,

02:24.445 --> 02:28.380
and especially religious symbols
can influence her findings,

02:28.382 --> 02:32.717
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:32.719 --> 02:33.985
Once I'm finished,

02:33.987 --> 02:36.388
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.601
Boy. Boy.
Boy. Boy.

02:49.603 --> 02:53.204
I am hearing screams.
Horrible screaming.

02:53.206 --> 02:54.472
I'm hearing somebody saying,
like,

02:54.474 --> 02:59.143
"I don't want to die like this."

02:59.145 --> 03:01.279
I think it's a woman.

03:01.281 --> 03:03.348
This is not good.

03:09.489 --> 03:12.090
So, Sharon, when we spoke
on the phone it sounded like you

03:12.092 --> 03:13.558
were at the end
of your rope here.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.026
What the hell is going on?

03:15.028 --> 03:18.897
The paranormal that's going on
in this house is unbelievable.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.299
It's a fricking nightmare.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.433
The house is gonna kill me.

03:22.435 --> 03:24.169
All right.
So let's back up a minute.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.770
Who exactly lives in
the house?

03:25.772 --> 03:30.976
Right now it's myself
and my husband, Joe.

03:30.978 --> 03:31.976
Okay.

03:31.978 --> 03:35.380
We raised our
two daughters here.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.981
Bethany is 33.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.850
Olivia is 18.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.452
So, Sharon, you had mentioned
on the phone

03:40.454 --> 03:42.521
that you've had activity
pretty much

03:42.523 --> 03:43.854
the whole time
you've been here, right?

03:43.856 --> 03:45.790
- Right.
- Why are you calling us in now?

03:45.792 --> 03:49.594
In the last couple of years
it's gotten dangerous.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.196
Give me an idea of
what you're going through.

03:52.198 --> 03:56.400
We hear banging,
objects are moving around.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.337
We're seeing shadow figures.

03:59.339 --> 04:05.210
Physical attacks and my health
is declining very rapidly.

04:05.212 --> 04:08.146
- What are we talking about?
- I have hives and blisters.

04:08.148 --> 04:11.149
I've had my gall bladder
removed.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.817
I've had a heart attack.

04:12.819 --> 04:14.686
What makes you think
it's paranormal?

04:14.688 --> 04:18.089
I went to 20 different doctors
all over the state.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.559
Nobody could figure out
what was wrong.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.561
So your husband, is he dealing
with the same thing?

04:23.563 --> 04:24.762
What's the story with him?

04:24.764 --> 04:26.831
- He's a skeptic.
- Okay.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.433
He would rather bury his head
in the sand

04:28.435 --> 04:30.434
and pretend
this isn't happening.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.304
Is it causing problems
in your marriage?

04:32.306 --> 04:36.107
There's a lot of stress
and tension, a lot of fighting.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.843
Your daughters, do they realize
what's going on here?

04:38.845 --> 04:41.713
Yeah. They've both experienced
things themselves.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.448
- Okay.
- They're basically terrified.

04:44.450 --> 04:49.521
My whole goal in life
was to raise my family

04:49.523 --> 04:54.593
in a protective shell of love
and peace and happiness.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.929
This is not a happy,
peaceful house.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.263
What do you think is here?

04:59.265 --> 05:02.734
I know for a fact
that my mom is here.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.270
That's a picture of my mom.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.072
She died in '93.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.272
What did she pass from?

05:08.274 --> 05:10.141
She had a massive stroke.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.743
What kind of woman was she?

05:11.745 --> 05:14.613
My mom was
a master manipulator.

05:14.615 --> 05:19.017
She could make you feel guilty
for tying your shoe.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.019
You think she's causing
any of these problems?

05:21.021 --> 05:25.556
I don't know, but I don't think
she would be the one to hurt me.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.358
But you know, we're here.
What are you hoping we can do?

05:27.360 --> 05:30.028
I want my health back.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.230
I want my life back.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.032
We're gonna do our best, okay?

05:39.305 --> 05:41.372
So there's a dead woman.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.574
I see her sitting in
that chair.

05:43.576 --> 05:44.909
She's elderly.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.579
I want to say she was like
70-something when she died.

05:47.581 --> 05:51.449
She feels like a sense
of responsibility

05:51.451 --> 05:56.187
for this living person,
who I believe is a female.

05:56.189 --> 06:01.326
So she's made the choice
not to leave, to stay.

06:05.532 --> 06:10.869
I'm kind of thinking maybe
they're seeing, you know,

06:10.871 --> 06:12.269
somebody sitting there.

06:12.271 --> 06:15.406
Always feeling watched from
there, feeling the bad vibes.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.616
Okay, Sharon, so what's
going on outside here?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.084
All over the property,

06:26.086 --> 06:28.953
it's like somebody has always
got their eyes on you.

06:28.955 --> 06:32.490
Do you have any sense
of what's watching you or who?

06:32.492 --> 06:33.825
I have no idea.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.827
It's creepy.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.028
It's like there's someone
standing right behind you

06:38.030 --> 06:40.231
and at any given moment they're
going to grab hold of you

06:40.233 --> 06:42.700
and not let go.

06:42.702 --> 06:44.102
Okay, anything else?

06:44.104 --> 06:45.436
I was sitting in
the dining room

06:45.438 --> 06:47.705
and outside that window
right over there,

06:47.707 --> 06:49.774
I saw a man walk down
that sidewalk.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.509
We're talking like
an apparition?
Yeah.

06:51.511 --> 06:53.511
All right, can you
describe him for me?

06:53.513 --> 06:56.380
He was about your height,
had your color hair.

06:56.382 --> 06:59.383
He was wearing a blue worker's

06:59.385 --> 07:02.920
long-sleeved shirt,
blue pants.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.789
I see a bunch of garages.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.458
You sure it couldn't be somebody
coming out of there?

07:06.460 --> 07:08.526
Those buildings
weren't even there then.

07:08.528 --> 07:10.528
Okay. So anything else?

07:10.530 --> 07:14.932
We had taken my car to visit
my daughter at college.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.468
I was getting in
the passenger side.

07:17.470 --> 07:20.138
I was pushed while I was
getting into the car.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.806
Okay. Did you trip?

07:21.808 --> 07:23.808
No, I got pushed.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.277
When my head hit
that dashboard, Steve,

07:26.279 --> 07:29.547
I thought for sure
I had broke my neck.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.883
They did CAT scans, MRIs.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.618
They said I had
a traumatic brain injury.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.822
So you think something
from here followed you

07:37.824 --> 07:40.558
to your daughter's college
and did that to you?
Yes, I do.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.894
There's no place
I can go that I'm safe.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.095
It's gonna kill me.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.634
There's a very large male here.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.769
I don't like this guy.

07:51.771 --> 07:55.240
He's extremely physical
and hates women.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.640
He has been ****

07:56.642 --> 08:00.044
with my spine and my neck
and my upper back.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.315
It's extremely painful,

08:04.317 --> 08:06.317
and the living
are experiencing this.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.386
I think they would feel
immense amount

08:08.388 --> 08:13.257
of physical pain and fear.

08:13.259 --> 08:15.059
This is terrifying.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.928
Like, I don't like this.

08:16.930 --> 08:20.799
I feel like this guy
was probably a predator

08:20.801 --> 08:22.667
when he was alive.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.803
I'm feeling bad things
are happening in here.

08:25.805 --> 08:29.941
Like, touching and violation.

08:29.943 --> 08:35.011
The living would hear sounds,
like moaning and stuff,

08:35.014 --> 08:38.817
talking, having night terrors,

08:38.818 --> 08:40.551
like, legitimate night terrors

08:40.553 --> 08:43.154
from what's been happening.

08:48.895 --> 08:51.696
- What's going on?
- There's a lot of nightmares.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.897
They're very vivid.

08:52.899 --> 08:54.766
Describe what happens to you
in these nightmares.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.501
Basically the nightmares
all have a common theme.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.771
Whatever is chasing me
in these dreams,

08:59.773 --> 09:02.574
I know is bad
and it's gonna hurt me.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.975
Anything else?

09:03.977 --> 09:07.111
Well I was laying in bed.

09:07.113 --> 09:08.979
- Joe had already gone to work.
- Okay.

09:08.981 --> 09:11.449
And the next thing I know,
the sheets lift up,

09:11.451 --> 09:13.350
somebody crawls in bed with me.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.319
So when this thing
crawled into bed with you,

09:15.321 --> 09:17.521
get any sense if it was, like,
the weight of a man?

09:17.523 --> 09:20.591
The pressure feels like it
would be, yes.
Okay.

09:20.593 --> 09:21.993
Okay, anything else?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.461
I have had my head stroked.

09:24.463 --> 09:28.132
I have had my hip patted.

09:28.134 --> 09:29.066
Okay.

09:29.068 --> 09:32.604
I have had my stomach stroked.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.471
- While in bed?
- Yes.

09:34.473 --> 09:37.075
Anything else physical
like that I should know about?

09:37.077 --> 09:40.544
I've been pushed in here,
and just yesterday

09:40.546 --> 09:44.148
I woke up feeling
like someone literally had

09:44.150 --> 09:47.017
just sucker-punched me
right in the stomach.

09:47.019 --> 09:49.153
All day I was in pain.

09:49.155 --> 09:52.557
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.
I mean, this is bad.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.692
There's something
definitely evil here.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.300
There's something weird here.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.102
Something weird here.

10:05.104 --> 10:09.107
This living person
is seeing this guy,

10:09.109 --> 10:11.175
the big one who hates women.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.911
I'm feeling like

10:13.913 --> 10:19.317
I'm being punched
in the stomach hard.

10:19.319 --> 10:23.988
Like they've been
just nailed right here.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.256
Waking up, can't breathe.

10:29.929 --> 10:34.666
So what the hell is going on?

10:34.668 --> 10:35.867
It's -- There's a lot of pain.

10:35.869 --> 10:40.672
I mean, there is a lot of
**** pain.

10:40.674 --> 10:43.474
Is he trying to give her
a heart attack?

10:43.476 --> 10:47.211
He says, "If she is not already
dead, she will be soon."

11:13.372 --> 11:15.238
So, Joe, I was talking
with your wife earlier

11:15.240 --> 11:17.774
and she had mentioned that
you were pretty skeptical

11:17.776 --> 11:19.042
about the whole
paranormal thing.

11:19.044 --> 11:21.511
Yeah, but here within
the last couple years,

11:21.513 --> 11:23.046
I have had
a few experiences.

11:23.048 --> 11:25.648
I've seen a couple
shadow people.

11:25.650 --> 11:26.783
Shadow figures?

11:26.785 --> 11:28.452
In the hallway, yes.

11:28.454 --> 11:30.253
Is it something that
you see clearly,

11:30.255 --> 11:31.655
like you make out
what it is?

11:31.657 --> 11:34.791
Yeah, it looks like about
a 6-foot tall shadow person

11:34.793 --> 11:37.060
going from my living room
to our bedroom.

11:37.062 --> 11:39.529
So you are having some kind of
a paranormal experience

11:39.531 --> 11:41.531
that you can't explain?
- Yes.

11:41.533 --> 11:42.799
Anything else going on
with you guys?

11:42.801 --> 11:45.668
Me and the wife's
been fighting a lot.

11:45.670 --> 11:46.936
You know, couples fight.

11:46.938 --> 11:48.605
What makes you think
it's the paranormal?

11:48.607 --> 11:49.740
Everything is good one minute.

11:49.742 --> 11:52.809
The next minute
she's up in arms.

11:52.811 --> 11:55.212
She just attacks.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.881
When you guys go away
or if you go visit your daughter

11:57.883 --> 12:00.550
at college or anything,
does it continue?

12:00.552 --> 12:02.352
- It subsides.
- Okay.

12:02.354 --> 12:04.554
And then it seems like it
gets worse when we come back.

12:04.556 --> 12:06.422
Your wife is going
through hell here

12:06.424 --> 12:09.693
between being physically
attacked by something

12:09.695 --> 12:11.027
she can't see.

12:11.029 --> 12:12.896
I mean, she thinks something
here is trying to kill her.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.766
It's kind of disheartening,

12:16.768 --> 12:19.836
not knowing if I can...

12:19.838 --> 12:21.638
- Sorry.
- No, it's all right.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.640
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff
that's going on that

12:23.642 --> 12:25.708
I don't know.

12:25.710 --> 12:29.846
I just can't explain
the feeling that I have

12:29.848 --> 12:31.848
that I can't help
anybody out.

12:35.721 --> 12:36.920
There's a lot of anger.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.388
There's a lot of fighting.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.593
Who's fighting?

12:43.595 --> 12:44.594
Living people.

12:44.596 --> 12:47.731
This man and the woman here.

12:47.733 --> 12:51.268
Is this something related
to paranormal happening here?

12:51.270 --> 12:55.539
More than likely due
to the paranormal.

12:59.677 --> 13:02.078
Someone's claiming, you know,

13:02.080 --> 13:04.013
that this or that
or the other thing happened,

13:04.015 --> 13:07.884
and the other person is like,
"No. I'm over it."

13:07.886 --> 13:09.685
Doesn't believe.

13:09.687 --> 13:13.289
I'm taking it from the fighting
that this person's leaving,

13:13.291 --> 13:16.760
already kind of
on their way out.

13:16.762 --> 13:19.095
I think the woman is dying.

13:27.372 --> 13:29.639
Olivia, I was talking
to mom today.-

13:29.641 --> 13:32.775
And your mom said the reason
you don't want to stay here

13:32.777 --> 13:34.444
is because of
the experiences you've had.

13:34.446 --> 13:35.979
- Is that right?
- Yes.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.981
I ask everybody that I know
if I could stay with them

13:37.983 --> 13:40.450
before I end up staying here.
- All right.

13:40.452 --> 13:43.786
Can you tell me about
some of your experiences?
Yes.

13:43.788 --> 13:46.456
I was looking in the mirror
and behind me

13:46.458 --> 13:49.125
I saw, like, an older woman.

13:49.127 --> 13:51.861
And I turned around to see if,
like, there was

13:51.863 --> 13:56.532
an actual person behind me,
and she, like, lunged at me.

13:56.534 --> 13:59.202
Now, your mom told me she thinks
your grandmother may be here.-

13:59.204 --> 14:02.005
Is it possible
that that's who it was?
Yeah.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.941
It looked like her
but a younger version.

14:04.943 --> 14:07.476
All right, so you saw this
apparition of a woman.

14:07.478 --> 14:08.545
Anything else?

14:08.547 --> 14:11.548
I see several shadow figures
in my room,

14:11.550 --> 14:15.018
several shadow figures crossing
the hallway between my room

14:15.020 --> 14:18.020
and my parents' room
all the time.

14:18.022 --> 14:20.223
So, Olivia, mom was saying
that she actually thinks

14:20.225 --> 14:22.225
that whatever is in this house
is trying to kill her.

14:22.227 --> 14:24.494
I mean,
do you agree with that?

14:24.496 --> 14:26.295
It wouldn't surprise me,
honestly.

14:26.297 --> 14:29.098
Whatever is here,
it's definitely not good.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.704
I'm seeing this really
tall shadow thing.

14:34.706 --> 14:37.107
I think it was a man
at one point.

14:40.512 --> 14:41.911
Can you describe it?

14:41.913 --> 14:44.313
Very thin, long legs.

14:44.315 --> 14:49.719
He just comes over and,
like, engulfs me.

14:49.721 --> 14:53.189
This thing is supposed to work
for death, but it's gone rogue.

14:56.128 --> 15:01.664
It likes to kind of torture
people who have just died,

15:01.666 --> 15:05.534
keeping them kind of trapped in,
like, their death state.

15:05.536 --> 15:07.670
Not allowing them to move on.

15:07.672 --> 15:11.807
Basically all the opposite
of what death usually does.

15:11.809 --> 15:16.212
And instead it learns to feed,

15:16.214 --> 15:18.682
and it grows.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.149
Does it affect the living
in any way?

15:20.151 --> 15:22.752
I wouldn't put it past
the living

15:22.754 --> 15:24.887
seeing it on occasion.

15:24.889 --> 15:27.691
When you're exposed to it,
you get illnesses.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.025
I think they would die.

15:34.032 --> 15:35.231
Bethany,
from what I understand,

15:35.233 --> 15:36.299
you actually grew up
in this house.

15:36.301 --> 15:37.434
- Correct?
- Yes.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.970
We moved out here
when I was 13.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.305
What were some of the things
you experienced?

15:42.307 --> 15:45.908
The major one is when I come
over to the house,

15:45.910 --> 15:48.912
I feel emotionally
and physically drained.

15:48.914 --> 15:51.381
Okay.
Are you feeling that now?
Yeah.

15:51.383 --> 15:54.383
It feels like the life
is being sucked out of me.

15:54.385 --> 15:55.986
All right.
So you're feeling drained.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.387
Anything else going on?

15:57.389 --> 16:01.591
When I lived here I had a very
terrifying nightmare

16:01.593 --> 16:03.660
where something
chasing after me.

16:03.662 --> 16:06.796
I was trying to get away
but I actually fell out of bed

16:06.798 --> 16:08.732
and broke my shoulder.

16:08.734 --> 16:10.333
They said that I was very lucky

16:10.335 --> 16:13.536
that I didn't break my neck,
the way I fell out of bed.

16:13.538 --> 16:15.405
So when I talked to your mom,
her emotional state

16:15.407 --> 16:16.539
is pretty...

16:16.541 --> 16:18.141
She's not my mom anymore.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.076
In what way has she changed?

16:20.078 --> 16:25.148
She is quick to get upset.

16:25.150 --> 16:29.486
Right now she doesn't have
a lot of control over that.

16:29.488 --> 16:33.156
I think the entity
has more control over it.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.090
It's heartbreaking.

16:40.098 --> 16:44.034
I'm getting, like,
brutal ****, man.

16:44.036 --> 16:47.904
Somebody being tossed around
the room like a rag doll

16:47.906 --> 16:50.307
and feeling the pain,
the neck.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.975
My **** god.

16:52.977 --> 16:54.778
I think it's a woman.

16:54.780 --> 16:58.248
- That it's happening to?
- Yes.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.917
It's horrible, horrible,
horrible pain.

17:01.919 --> 17:04.319
The shadow thing is the one
doing this.

17:04.321 --> 17:07.857
Whatever it is goes inside
of them and then leaves

17:07.858 --> 17:10.126
and then goes inside of them
and then leaves.

17:10.127 --> 17:11.594
What exactly do you mean,
he goes inside

17:11.596 --> 17:12.929
of them and leaves?

17:12.931 --> 17:17.200
They're being possessed.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.734
Also, it's not gonna be
pleasant

17:18.737 --> 17:20.403
for anybody around this person

17:20.405 --> 17:25.208
because they're, you know,
turning into something else,

17:25.210 --> 17:29.746
mentally, personality-wise.

17:29.748 --> 17:32.082
How might this affect someone
in the long run?

17:32.084 --> 17:36.819
Well, I'm just kind of seeing,
like, a breakdown of cells...

17:36.821 --> 17:38.621
mutation of cells,
which, you know,

17:38.623 --> 17:43.159
obviously can cause different
kinds of diseases or illnesses.

17:43.161 --> 17:46.763
I'm feeling sick, really sick.

18:07.685 --> 18:10.053
Now we did a case
in Springfield last year,

18:10.055 --> 18:12.655
so I already have
some connections here.

18:12.657 --> 18:13.989
I just got a call
from my old friend

18:13.991 --> 18:15.724
Natalie Fritz,
a genealogist.

18:15.726 --> 18:18.194
Says she came up with something
that's going to help me out.

18:18.196 --> 18:21.197
Turns out there used to be
a church on Sharon's land.

18:21.199 --> 18:23.266
That is, until a deacon
who ran it lost his mind.

18:30.342 --> 18:31.674
Natalie, it's good
to see you again.

18:31.676 --> 18:33.876
So I know there was a church
on my client's property.

18:33.878 --> 18:35.344
What can you tell me about it?

18:35.346 --> 18:37.146
Well it was a Seventh Day
Baptist church,

18:37.148 --> 18:38.948
and it was built in 1825

18:38.950 --> 18:40.683
by the original owner's
of your client's property.

18:40.685 --> 18:43.619
And they also donated the land
to build a cemetery.

18:43.621 --> 18:45.888
Okay, so what do we know
about this family?

18:45.890 --> 18:48.224
Well, the Lippencott family,
they bought the land, 1819.

18:48.226 --> 18:49.759
And the patriarch
of the family's name

18:49.761 --> 18:51.027
was Samuel Lippencott,

18:51.029 --> 18:52.562
and he brought the family
here from New Jersey

18:52.564 --> 18:54.831
because he was looking
for religious freedom.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.700
This guy, Samuel, donates land
to build the church

18:57.702 --> 19:01.037
and also have the grave site
for the congregation.

19:01.039 --> 19:03.706
I mean, how involved is he
in the church?

19:03.708 --> 19:05.174
Well, the church was
very important to him.

19:05.176 --> 19:06.575
He was a deacon there.

19:06.577 --> 19:08.978
So is this the deacon
that lost his mind?

19:08.980 --> 19:10.112
Yes.

19:10.114 --> 19:11.848
He was a big part of the church
for 25 years,

19:11.850 --> 19:13.316
but in the last few years
of his life,

19:13.318 --> 19:14.918
he was showing signs
of dementia.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.385
He was having delusions,

19:16.387 --> 19:18.521
and he was no longer able to be
a part of the church.

19:18.523 --> 19:20.790
He ended up dying on the land

19:20.792 --> 19:23.459
just a few years later
in 1853 at age 93.

19:23.461 --> 19:26.195
All right, so was he buried in
the land that he donated?

19:26.197 --> 19:28.398
Yes. Several members of
the Lippencott family

19:28.400 --> 19:29.732
were buried there.
- He's dead.

19:29.734 --> 19:31.133
What happens with the church?

19:31.135 --> 19:32.802
Well, he was kind of the glue
that held the church together,

19:32.804 --> 19:35.538
so after his death
the congregation dwindled.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.340
And by 1905 there
was nobody left,

19:37.342 --> 19:39.008
so the church was abandoned.

19:39.010 --> 19:41.143
It's now a public school
on that property.

19:41.145 --> 19:42.211
All right.
So the church is gone,

19:42.213 --> 19:43.746
but what happened
to the cemetery?

19:43.748 --> 19:45.748
Well, when the school
was built in 1923,

19:45.750 --> 19:47.283
they dug up the bodies
and they moved them

19:47.285 --> 19:48.952
about a quarter of a mile away.

19:48.954 --> 19:52.154
So can I assume that
they took Samuel

19:52.156 --> 19:55.158
and the rest of the Lippencott
family to the new grave site? - Yes.

20:00.064 --> 20:05.334
I have this dead person
with me who I think is a male.

20:05.336 --> 20:07.669
All I hear is his voice,
and he keeps saying,

20:07.671 --> 20:11.673
"In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost."

20:11.675 --> 20:13.676
And it's, like, nonstop.

20:13.678 --> 20:15.277
He won't stop.

20:15.279 --> 20:17.145
And I hear,
"There is no God here."

20:17.147 --> 20:19.181
And then I see two graveyards
have been lost.

20:25.089 --> 20:26.555
So I'm heading over to meet
a lieutenant

20:26.557 --> 20:27.890
from the sheriff's department.

20:27.892 --> 20:30.292
He did some digging for me
and came up with a homicide

20:30.294 --> 20:32.895
a couple of thousand feet
from Sharon's house.

20:32.897 --> 20:35.097
Now the victim got shot
execution-style

20:35.099 --> 20:36.499
in the back of the head,

20:36.501 --> 20:37.833
but he says I'm going
to be surprised

20:37.835 --> 20:38.900
by who pulled the trigger.

20:48.112 --> 20:50.645
So Lieutenant, thanks for
helping me out with this case.

20:50.647 --> 20:51.914
What do we know
about the victim?

20:51.916 --> 20:53.716
The victim's name
is Kenneth Bradley.

20:53.718 --> 20:54.983
He was an auto mechanic.

20:54.985 --> 20:57.653
Worked at one of the car
dealerships downtown here.

20:57.655 --> 21:00.723
Okay. Obviously,
this guy gets whacked.

21:00.725 --> 21:01.790
What happened?

21:01.792 --> 21:04.059
So on the morning
of January 9th, 1980,

21:04.061 --> 21:05.928
he doesn't show up for work
at the car dealership.

21:05.930 --> 21:07.663
- Okay.
- His boss gets concerned,

21:07.665 --> 21:09.665
so our deputy goes out
to the residence

21:09.667 --> 21:11.734
and finds Kenneth laying
on the floor of the front room,

21:11.736 --> 21:15.137
faceup, dead with a gunshot
wound to the back of his head.

21:15.139 --> 21:16.472
Okay, so you had mentioned

21:16.474 --> 21:18.740
that I was going to be
surprised by who did this.

21:18.742 --> 21:20.142
A gunshot wound to the back
of the head

21:20.144 --> 21:22.344
sounds like
a professional hit,

21:22.346 --> 21:27.950
but the only suspect that we had
was his recent ex-wife Dorothy.

21:27.952 --> 21:29.485
Did they ever catch up
to the wife?

21:29.487 --> 21:30.952
Yeah, they located her
with a friend

21:30.954 --> 21:32.754
and ended up bringing
her in for questioning.

21:32.756 --> 21:35.291
She explains to them that
her and Kenneth

21:35.293 --> 21:36.825
were arguing all night long,

21:36.827 --> 21:40.362
and in the early morning hours,
she hears a loud noise.

21:40.364 --> 21:43.499
She looks through the doorway
after hearing this loud noise

21:43.501 --> 21:46.702
and sees Kenneth laying
on the floor of the front room.

21:46.704 --> 21:49.905
So she puts her coat on
and leaves the house.

21:49.907 --> 21:51.106
That's her story?

21:51.108 --> 21:52.441
Yes, that's her story.

21:52.443 --> 21:54.042
Obviously,
it's pretty thin and weak,

21:54.044 --> 21:56.044
so the detectives arrest her,

21:56.046 --> 21:58.447
charge her with aggravated
murder and put her in the jail.

22:01.051 --> 22:02.584
But the prosecutor's office

22:02.586 --> 22:04.653
amends the indictment
against her

22:04.655 --> 22:06.788
for aggravated murder
to a lesser charge

22:06.790 --> 22:09.792
of voluntary manslaughter.
- So help me out here.

22:09.794 --> 22:12.261
I never heard of
voluntary manslaughter.

22:12.263 --> 22:14.196
Voluntary manslaughter is one
of those charges

22:14.198 --> 22:15.597
that's kind of unique
to Ohio.

22:15.599 --> 22:20.469
Someone, the victim does
something or commits some act

22:20.471 --> 22:22.338
that would incite
a normal person

22:22.340 --> 22:24.139
into using deadly force.

22:24.141 --> 22:25.807
There is a possibility

22:25.809 --> 22:28.677
that there may have been
some kind of abuse going on.

22:28.679 --> 22:30.946
- Okay.
- She may have just snapped.

22:30.948 --> 22:34.216
Okay, so now the charges
get reduced really low now.

22:34.218 --> 22:35.550
What does she do?

22:35.552 --> 22:37.820
Dorothy pleads guilty
to the voluntary manslaughter

22:37.822 --> 22:40.289
and is sentenced to
4 years to 25 years,

22:40.291 --> 22:43.759
but in actuality she only serves
two years in the penitentiary

22:43.761 --> 22:47.096
and the remainder
of the time on probation.

22:47.098 --> 22:48.631
So she literally got away
with murder?

22:52.636 --> 22:54.369
I'm seeing this woman here.

22:54.371 --> 22:56.171
Something happened here.

22:56.173 --> 22:58.040
I'm seeing her reaching
for the door.

23:01.179 --> 23:03.912
This woman is like,
"I don't want to die this way.

23:03.914 --> 23:07.983
Please, god, no.
Somebody help me."

23:07.985 --> 23:11.320
I'd say this is, like,
'80s, '90s.

23:11.322 --> 23:12.855
And she's crawling
on the ground.

23:12.857 --> 23:15.791
The one guy, the one big
dead guy has a chain

23:15.793 --> 23:19.327
to the neck of the chick,
and he's got me.

23:24.201 --> 23:26.602
Yeah, this ****
got me good.

23:29.473 --> 23:33.742
This angry guy who hates women,
he's massive like a fricking,

23:33.744 --> 23:35.343
like a brick wall, you know?

23:35.345 --> 23:37.212
He's a big guy.

23:37.214 --> 23:38.813
He's got a stomach.

23:38.815 --> 23:42.884
He's white, he's bald,
and he's got a shotgun rigged,

23:42.886 --> 23:43.952
and he blows his head off.

23:45.423 --> 23:48.423
And I keep hearing,
"crimes, punishment, lies."

23:48.425 --> 23:51.227
This is somebody
who died a bad death.

23:59.103 --> 24:01.103
For more information
about the show,

24:01.105 --> 24:02.704
and if you need us
to investigate

24:02.706 --> 24:04.673
unexplained activity
in your home...

24:04.675 --> 24:08.110
Please visit
travelchannel.com/thedeadfiles.

24:08.112 --> 24:09.444
Click on "Help me, Dead Files!"

24:09.446 --> 24:11.180
to submit your story,
and we'll help if we can.

24:25.928 --> 24:28.862
So far I've got a client
terrified something in her house

24:28.864 --> 24:30.798
is trying to kill her
on a property

24:30.800 --> 24:32.399
that used to have a cemetery

24:32.401 --> 24:35.936
where all the bodies
were dug up and moved,

24:35.938 --> 24:39.607
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

24:39.609 --> 24:40.808
Searching through old records,

24:40.810 --> 24:44.611
I find a deadly plane
crash in 1941.

24:44.613 --> 24:47.081
Turns out it happened about
a mile from Sharon's property.

24:51.487 --> 24:53.754
So I put a call into
a local historian

24:53.756 --> 24:56.089
who knows all about this crash.

24:56.091 --> 24:58.759
He says the accident
was incredibly violent,

24:58.761 --> 25:00.761
and the victims
never stood a chance.

25:09.171 --> 25:12.039
So Dr. Taylor, thanks for
helping me once again on a case.

25:12.041 --> 25:14.308
So the plane crash that happens
by my client's property,

25:14.310 --> 25:15.910
what can you tell me
about that?

25:15.912 --> 25:18.445
There's an airfield 10 miles
west of your client's house

25:18.447 --> 25:20.114
called Patterson Field.

25:20.116 --> 25:21.915
This is 1941.

25:21.917 --> 25:24.385
The U.S. is ramping up
its military capability,

25:24.387 --> 25:26.654
especially its aviation
capability.

25:26.656 --> 25:30.324
- Right.
- On November 18th, 1941,

25:30.326 --> 25:34.862
this B-26, which was similar
to the plane behind us here,

25:34.864 --> 25:37.798
flew out of Patterson Field
with three men on board.

25:37.800 --> 25:40.468
- This is a photo of a B-26.
- All right.

25:40.470 --> 25:42.336
So what went wrong?

25:42.338 --> 25:44.939
Well, they're flying
at about 15,000 feet,

25:44.941 --> 25:47.741
and for some reason
the plane lost power

25:47.743 --> 25:49.609
and began spiraling down.

25:49.611 --> 25:52.946
And then it just nosedived
into a corn field

25:52.948 --> 25:55.282
about a mile
from your client's house.

25:55.284 --> 25:57.284
Rattled windows
two miles away.

25:57.286 --> 25:58.619
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:58.621 --> 26:02.155
It created about a 10-foot
deep crater, 30 feet wide.

26:02.157 --> 26:04.491
The flames reached as high
as the trees.

26:04.493 --> 26:07.695
The first man on the site
tried to reach the pilots.

26:07.697 --> 26:10.097
He reached one of them,
grabbed hold of him

26:10.099 --> 26:11.832
to try to pull him away
from the fire

26:11.834 --> 26:15.368
and as he pulled him away
he realized that he was dead.

26:15.370 --> 26:19.440
His body was literally
coming apart.

26:19.442 --> 26:21.842
Wow.
Was this an isolated incident?

26:21.844 --> 26:25.846
The B-26 already had
a reputation for accidents,

26:25.848 --> 26:30.717
and a month later another B-26
went down, killing five men.

26:30.719 --> 26:32.786
And so by the end of the year
it had a reputation

26:32.788 --> 26:34.989
for being a plane that was not
only accident-prone,

26:34.991 --> 26:38.125
but a widow-maker
was the term they used.

26:38.127 --> 26:47.868
- Really?
- Yes.

26:47.870 --> 26:51.138
There's a dead guy in there.

26:51.140 --> 26:54.608
He's all **** up.

26:54.610 --> 26:57.011
There's just pain.

26:57.013 --> 26:59.547
From head to toe, there's pain.

26:59.549 --> 27:03.818
Pain.

27:03.820 --> 27:06.753
I don't think he understands
what's happening.

27:06.755 --> 27:10.958
He is broken,

27:10.960 --> 27:13.426
and I see blood and...

27:13.428 --> 27:15.629
mangled, bloody mess.

27:15.631 --> 27:18.098
So do you have any idea
what happened to him?

27:18.100 --> 27:21.434
I mean, there's a couple of
things that could've happened.

27:21.436 --> 27:25.306
One possibility is, like,
being in a car accident

27:25.308 --> 27:27.241
or being
in an airplane accident.

27:30.812 --> 27:32.312
Do you know why he's here?

27:32.314 --> 27:35.182
All I know is that
he is stuck here

27:35.184 --> 27:39.587
because of this bad death.

27:39.589 --> 27:43.456
I don't think it's good
for people to be around him.

27:43.458 --> 27:47.127
He's in a very bad death state,

27:47.129 --> 27:51.231
and if you meld too much
with him it could hurt you.

28:00.676 --> 28:04.878
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk, but two stood out.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.482
First, the large dead man
attacking a living woman.

28:08.484 --> 28:11.619
He's huge, bald, got a big head

28:11.621 --> 28:16.757
and he's holding on
to this chick.

28:16.759 --> 28:19.894
She's on her knees wearing
a collar, but it's like steel.

28:19.896 --> 28:22.163
Like, it's metal.

28:22.165 --> 28:25.498
His head was kind of
a little bit bigger.

28:25.500 --> 28:28.568
Next, I describe
a tall shadow thing.

28:28.570 --> 28:31.638
So he's got these things,
like roots,

28:31.640 --> 28:33.374
and they're big
and, like, bulbous.

28:33.376 --> 28:37.911
He gets that stuff on
the person when they die.

28:37.913 --> 28:40.113
He's all mangled.

28:40.115 --> 28:44.785
I don't know how he died,
but he's a mess.

28:44.787 --> 28:46.720
Amy, is that what you saw?

28:46.722 --> 28:48.722
Yes, that's what I saw.

29:14.582 --> 29:17.583
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

29:17.585 --> 29:19.786
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

29:19.788 --> 29:22.788
and our clients
for the first time.

29:22.790 --> 29:25.525
So Amy, I'd like you to meet
Sharon and her husband, Joe.

29:25.527 --> 29:27.994
They've had activity in this
house for over 20 years.

29:27.996 --> 29:30.396
These two don't know
exactly what happened,

29:30.398 --> 29:32.399
but a few years
back something changed.

29:32.401 --> 29:35.068
Now activity is violent
and aggressive,

29:35.070 --> 29:37.336
and Sharon is convinced
that whatever is here,

29:37.338 --> 29:39.672
if we can't stop it,
it's gonna kill her.

29:39.674 --> 29:42.208
So now that Amy knows
who you guys are,

29:42.210 --> 29:46.947
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

29:46.949 --> 29:50.216
The first deceased person
I encountered

29:50.218 --> 29:53.820
was in the master bedroom,
and it was a female.

29:53.822 --> 29:57.890
But I did get that she died
in her 70s or 80s.

29:57.892 --> 30:00.160
I got that the living woman
in that bedroom

30:00.162 --> 30:02.628
knew this dead woman somehow.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.965
This dead woman
feels responsible

30:04.967 --> 30:07.567
for the living female here.

30:07.569 --> 30:11.771
She told me she made the choice
to stay and watch over her,

30:11.773 --> 30:15.308
but now that has made
her angry and resentful.

30:15.310 --> 30:18.511
She told me she resents
this living woman

30:18.513 --> 30:21.914
because she feels she shouldn't
be responsible for her.

30:24.386 --> 30:25.451
- You okay?
- Sorry.

30:25.453 --> 30:26.652
No, don't be.

30:26.654 --> 30:30.924
Listen, Sharon thought
her mother might be here.

30:33.528 --> 30:35.195
From the time I was 14,

30:35.197 --> 30:37.864
I've basically took care
of my mother.

30:37.866 --> 30:40.934
I gave up everything

30:40.936 --> 30:44.204
to be there
and take care of her.

30:44.206 --> 30:48.742
And to find out that
she's resentful

30:48.744 --> 30:52.611
for watching over me
after all I did,

30:52.613 --> 30:56.082
it really makes me mad.

30:56.084 --> 31:00.553
Now here's a picture of Sharon
and her mother.

31:00.555 --> 31:03.823
Do you think the older woman
back there is Sharon's mom?

31:03.825 --> 31:05.492
Yeah.

31:05.494 --> 31:08.494
So is the mom
interacting with them?
Yes.

31:08.496 --> 31:12.965
I would believe that you would
potentially feel

31:12.967 --> 31:15.035
watched all the time,

31:15.037 --> 31:19.772
and possibly see an outline
of a female on occasion.

31:19.774 --> 31:22.308
I'm constantly watched.

31:22.310 --> 31:25.711
I constantly feel like there's
someone right on my back.

31:25.713 --> 31:27.246
Now when I spoke to Olivia,

31:27.248 --> 31:29.582
she thought she saw
an apparition of an old lady

31:29.584 --> 31:33.186
that she thought
might have been your mom.

31:33.188 --> 31:36.122
I wish she'd move on.

31:36.124 --> 31:37.924
I suffered enough.

31:42.063 --> 31:46.799
The next dead person
that I encountered was a male.

31:46.801 --> 31:50.403
Very big, very tall,
very menacing.

31:50.405 --> 31:54.474
He does have perversions.

31:54.476 --> 31:57.610
When I saw this dead male,
he was holding a chain.

31:57.612 --> 32:01.848
The chain led to this
dead woman.

32:01.850 --> 32:04.017
He hates her,

32:04.019 --> 32:08.621
and I saw him
beating her senseless.

32:08.623 --> 32:12.759
I got that this happened
at some point in the '80s,

32:12.761 --> 32:16.695
and I heard the woman say,
"I don't want to die this way."

32:16.697 --> 32:19.765
Some of the things you said
remind me of a couple

32:19.767 --> 32:21.834
who used to live
down the block from here.

32:21.836 --> 32:25.237
Now their names were
Kenneth and Dorothy Bradley.

32:25.239 --> 32:29.775
On January 8th, 1980, the two
of them got into a huge fight.

32:29.777 --> 32:32.111
We don't know exactly
what went down,

32:32.113 --> 32:33.512
but she wound up shooting him
in the back

32:33.514 --> 32:35.115
of the head execution-style.

32:35.117 --> 32:39.319
- What?
- And here's an article.

32:39.321 --> 32:40.653
You said this guy hates
and beats women.

32:40.655 --> 32:42.822
Now we've got no proof of this,
but authorities believe

32:42.824 --> 32:44.390
Kenneth was beating up
on Dorothy,

32:44.392 --> 32:47.327
and that's what caused her
to snap and kill him.

32:47.329 --> 32:49.596
Dorothy plead guilty
to manslaughter charges

32:49.598 --> 32:53.466
and wound up serving
just two years.

32:53.468 --> 32:56.002
He is active
in the master bedroom.

32:56.004 --> 33:00.073
He did show me him
touching women inappropriately.

33:00.075 --> 33:03.309
I've had my hair caressed.

33:03.311 --> 33:06.145
I've had my hip patted.

33:06.147 --> 33:09.282
Had my stomach rubbed.

33:09.284 --> 33:11.751
Obviously he was very
physical and violent.

33:11.753 --> 33:14.753
I'm feeling like

33:14.755 --> 33:19.959
I'm being punched
in the stomach hard.

33:19.961 --> 33:24.763
Like they've been just nailed
right here.

33:24.765 --> 33:27.500
I come up out of the bed
at 4:30 in the morning.

33:27.502 --> 33:30.436
I felt like I had been slugged
in the stomach.

33:30.438 --> 33:33.906
I was nauseous until I got
out of the house.

33:33.908 --> 33:35.441
And one of the scariest
experiences

33:35.443 --> 33:37.777
that Sharon
had actually happened

33:37.779 --> 33:39.312
visiting your daughter
at college, right?

33:39.314 --> 33:41.714
- Yes.
- Tell Amy what happened.

33:41.716 --> 33:46.653
I was stepping off a curb onto
the running board of my SUV.

33:46.655 --> 33:50.857
I was pushed and went jaw-first
into the dashboard.

33:50.859 --> 33:54.660
I ended up in the hospital
with a traumatic brain injury.

33:54.662 --> 33:58.797
It pisses me off pretty bad.

33:58.799 --> 34:01.201
I did have a sketch done
of what I saw

34:01.203 --> 34:04.070
when he presented to me.

34:13.481 --> 34:15.748
Holy ****.

34:15.750 --> 34:18.884
Wow.

34:18.886 --> 34:22.821
That's exactly how it feels.

34:22.822 --> 34:26.693
That's exactly how it feels.

34:26.695 --> 34:28.960
I feel like I'm constantly
under attack.

34:31.966 --> 34:34.500
So what else did you encounter?

34:34.502 --> 34:37.902
So I walked into
the middle bedroom,

34:37.905 --> 34:40.505
and what I saw was a female

34:40.507 --> 34:44.444
being kind of thrown
around the room.

34:44.446 --> 34:46.178
This thing that looked like
a shadow

34:46.179 --> 34:48.181
was taking over
this living woman

34:48.183 --> 34:51.184
but very temporarily,
attacking and controlling

34:51.186 --> 34:53.252
and then leaving her body.

34:53.254 --> 34:57.190
When this living woman
would get possessed like this,

34:57.192 --> 35:00.460
she would have personality
and behavioral changes.

35:00.462 --> 35:01.994
This is dangerous.

35:01.996 --> 35:03.263
It can cause you to lash out

35:03.265 --> 35:05.932
and do things
to yourself or others.

35:05.934 --> 35:08.134
And the other thing is that
it can really have

35:08.136 --> 35:11.938
a detrimental effect
on a living body

35:11.940 --> 35:15.474
that can lead to
a lot of different

35:15.476 --> 35:20.479
kind of long-term potential
illnesses like cancers,

35:20.481 --> 35:22.348
things like that.

35:22.350 --> 35:25.684
Actually everything
you're describing sounds a lot

35:25.686 --> 35:27.887
like what
Sharon's going through.

35:27.889 --> 35:31.023
I have fibromyalgia.

35:31.025 --> 35:35.628
I just had a surgery,

35:35.630 --> 35:41.300
and within two weeks
I had developed a cyst,

35:41.302 --> 35:43.502
and I went back
to the surgeon.

35:43.504 --> 35:46.839
He did a biopsy
and it's precancerous.

35:46.841 --> 35:49.042
Now your mood swings.

35:49.044 --> 35:52.178
A lot of times, you know,
I'll come home

35:52.180 --> 35:56.516
and all of a sudden
she's off the deep end,

35:56.518 --> 35:59.118
you know,
wanting to tear my throat out.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.253
Joe's not the only one
noticing her mood swings.

36:01.255 --> 36:03.255
Her daughter, Bethany,
when I spoke to her,

36:03.257 --> 36:04.724
she basically said
Sharon's becoming

36:04.726 --> 36:07.794
a totally different person,
negative and angry.

36:07.796 --> 36:11.130
Do you feel that that's what
you've been like at times?

36:11.132 --> 36:12.465
There are times, yeah.

36:12.467 --> 36:14.734
And when I get mad,
I get mad at everybody.

36:14.736 --> 36:16.803
'Cause I want to get
my control back.

36:16.805 --> 36:19.739
So do we think she's being
possessed at certain points?

36:19.741 --> 36:23.809
To some extent, yes.

36:23.811 --> 36:25.344
All right, so what is this
shadow thing

36:25.346 --> 36:26.679
that's possessing her?

36:26.681 --> 36:29.415
It's a deceased male

36:29.417 --> 36:34.153
who became this really tall
shadow thing.

36:34.155 --> 36:39.425
This is, like, the major issue
here, when he died.

36:39.427 --> 36:42.562
I believe he was supposed
to become

36:42.564 --> 36:47.099
a representative for death
and instead went rogue.

36:47.101 --> 36:49.569
What he does,
instead of moving people

36:49.571 --> 36:51.704
on to where they need to go,

36:51.706 --> 36:56.442
he kind of keeps people
trapped in their death state.

36:56.444 --> 36:57.777
It did look odd.

36:57.779 --> 37:00.646
It was, you know,
it was a dark black shape,

37:00.648 --> 37:03.716
extremely long arms and legs.

37:03.718 --> 37:05.051
Everybody is seeing
the shadow figures.

37:05.053 --> 37:06.252
- Yeah.
- Right.

37:06.254 --> 37:09.722
Black shadow walks between
the master bedroom

37:09.724 --> 37:11.991
and the back bedroom
constantly.

37:11.993 --> 37:13.393
And Joe, you've seen him
as well, right?

37:13.395 --> 37:15.061
Yes, in the hallway, same,

37:15.063 --> 37:18.197
walking between the two
back bedrooms.

37:18.199 --> 37:19.665
This thing emits, like,

37:19.667 --> 37:23.869
just this general negative,
nasty energy.

37:23.871 --> 37:25.571
I think that you could
feel obviously

37:25.573 --> 37:29.575
extremely negative feelings
from it, down, depression,

37:29.577 --> 37:31.944
some things of that nature.

37:31.946 --> 37:33.813
Yeah, depressed.

37:33.815 --> 37:36.749
But it's all kind of
coming together

37:36.751 --> 37:40.019
on what could be
happening here.

37:40.021 --> 37:42.822
I had a sketch done
of the shadow thing.

37:54.502 --> 37:56.768
My god.

37:56.770 --> 37:58.304
Wow.

38:01.976 --> 38:04.643
What the hell is that thing?

38:04.645 --> 38:08.714
So what happened was he died
and at the moment of his death,

38:08.716 --> 38:11.451
he literally became this thing,

38:11.453 --> 38:14.453
and he started
collecting people.

38:14.455 --> 38:15.855
I'm curious as to
what would happen

38:15.857 --> 38:17.523
if they didn't call us in?

38:17.525 --> 38:22.061
The worst scenario is that
you would die on the property

38:22.063 --> 38:26.265
and that you would be trapped
or prevented from moving on.

38:26.267 --> 38:31.670
I would have never thought that
this could happen to my family.

38:31.672 --> 38:34.673
I mean all these other houses
out here

38:34.675 --> 38:38.611
and it has to end up
on my property? Really?

38:38.613 --> 38:42.548
If I have to fight
this thing to my death,

38:42.550 --> 38:44.617
I know where I'm going.

38:44.619 --> 38:45.951
I'm going to Heaven.

38:45.953 --> 38:50.222
He may kill me,
but he's not gonna hold me.

38:50.224 --> 38:51.690
I've had enough.

38:51.692 --> 38:56.429
It's about time that
this family gets some peace.

39:17.601 --> 39:19.467
So Sharon, you called us in
because you thought

39:19.469 --> 39:21.002
your life was in danger here.

39:21.004 --> 39:23.071
Unfortunately for you,
dying in the house

39:23.073 --> 39:24.539
is the least of your worries.

39:24.541 --> 39:27.275
So now for the obvious question,
is there anything you can do

39:27.277 --> 39:30.479
to fix this, or do you need
to get the hell out of here

39:30.481 --> 39:31.947
before it's too late?

39:31.949 --> 39:36.684
For that answer I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:36.686 --> 39:41.690
So I want to give it
a really good shot

39:41.692 --> 39:45.427
as far as you
being able to live here.

39:45.429 --> 39:47.629
I have a very eclectic team.

39:47.631 --> 39:50.832
They consist of everything
from a blind,

39:50.834 --> 39:53.301
male medium to Wiccans

39:53.303 --> 39:55.904
and everything in between.

39:55.906 --> 40:00.208
The first thing that I want them
to do is to remove the predator.

40:00.210 --> 40:03.044
The second thing is going
to be removing your mother.

40:03.046 --> 40:05.113
Thank god.

40:05.115 --> 40:08.183
The third thing will be
extremely intense.

40:08.185 --> 40:11.987
What they're going to do
is remove the dead

40:11.989 --> 40:15.390
that this entity has trapped.

40:15.392 --> 40:16.725
Okay.

40:16.727 --> 40:19.861
Then the very last thing
is going to be the banishment

40:19.863 --> 40:24.666
of this entity
from your specific property.

40:24.668 --> 40:26.935
We can't remove him

40:26.937 --> 40:29.738
from the area,

40:29.740 --> 40:32.674
so if you leave your property

40:32.676 --> 40:36.277
you are exposed to it.

40:36.279 --> 40:37.746
My god.

40:37.748 --> 40:40.281
I don't know what
his reaction will be

40:40.283 --> 40:43.351
to being banished
from your property.

40:43.353 --> 40:45.754
Is he going to
become vengeful?

40:45.756 --> 40:47.222
I don't know.

40:47.224 --> 40:49.958
But if he does,
you would more than likely

40:49.960 --> 40:55.897
have to vacate this property
and move outside of his range.

40:55.899 --> 40:59.700
So right now it's a 50/50.

40:59.702 --> 41:01.035
So what do you think about

41:01.037 --> 41:02.704
a 50/50 shot of
being happy here?

41:02.706 --> 41:04.906
It's better than
what I thought I had.

41:04.908 --> 41:06.975
At least I have a chance.

41:06.977 --> 41:09.578
I had a hell of a childhood.

41:09.580 --> 41:11.780
I'd like to
have a nice old age.

41:11.782 --> 41:14.315
I'd like some happiness.

41:14.317 --> 41:15.517
So Joe, I'm curious.

41:15.519 --> 41:16.651
You going to be okay going
through the steps

41:16.653 --> 41:18.453
with the team
that's got to come in?

41:18.455 --> 41:20.322
Yeah, whatever it takes.

41:20.324 --> 41:24.259
I just want
my happy family back.

41:24.261 --> 41:29.130
Even though we're down,
we're not out.

41:29.132 --> 41:31.533
- Exactly.
- And we can build from here.

41:31.535 --> 41:33.468
Yes.

41:33.470 --> 41:35.136
And I'm grateful for that.

41:35.138 --> 41:38.740
Thank you.

41:38.742 --> 41:40.808
Just you and me, babe.

41:40.810 --> 41:42.677
We've got to hang tough.

41:42.679 --> 41:45.680
Yep. Whatever it takes.

41:45.682 --> 41:48.483
Sharon and Joe have a lot
of work ahead of them,

41:48.485 --> 41:50.618
but I believe if they work
with my team,

41:50.620 --> 41:53.955
they'll be able to free
their home and property of evil

41:53.957 --> 41:56.091
and find the peace
they deserve.

42:03.567 --> 42:06.768
Hi, Steve and Amy.
It's Sharon.

42:06.770 --> 42:11.106
I've taken your advice,
and we got your team in here.

42:11.108 --> 42:12.573
Things were a little rough,

42:12.575 --> 42:15.343
but they seem to be
doing better now.

42:15.345 --> 42:17.579
And our daughter is able
to sleep in her own room

42:17.581 --> 42:21.783
a lot better than she had been,
and our grandson is coming over

42:21.785 --> 42:24.585
and he don't seem
as afraid either.

42:24.587 --> 42:26.121
Thank you for coming out

42:26.123 --> 42:28.857
and helping us
with all of our issues.
