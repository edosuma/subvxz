00:00.834 --> 00:02.535
<i>previously,</i>
<i>on "brockmire"...</i>

00:02.670 --> 00:04.904
My wife, lucy,
was wearing a strap on,

00:05.039 --> 00:07.139
And plowing our neighbor
right in the ass.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.642
<i>Ten years ago, your</i>
<i>breakdown in the booth</i>

00:09.677 --> 00:13.178
And press conference were like
the original viral videos.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.581
The idea that our sex
is actually helping

00:15.716 --> 00:18.350
The frackers win ball games
is-it's ludicrous.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.653
You and i, we're kinda like
boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.756
Yeah, i know, jim.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.158
Lucy?

00:26.426 --> 00:28.594
Well, that guy's a quack.
I don't care what he says.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.162
There's nothing wrong
with either of us.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.631
I know.
I've never felt better.

00:32.667 --> 00:35.901
Well, darn it,
i'll keep trying if you will.

00:35.937 --> 00:37.136
jim.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.237
Mm!

00:38.272 --> 00:40.306
There's an unlocked closet
over there.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.807
I knew
there was a reason

00:41.842 --> 00:43.676
I didn't wear
any underwear today.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.878
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sweetheart.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.379
Um...

00:47.415 --> 00:50.015
When i came this morning,
my penis made a noise

00:50.051 --> 00:52.918
Like an old man getting up
off a leather couch, okay?

00:52.954 --> 00:56.689
How about we just slow down
the pace a little bit here?

00:57.558 --> 01:00.492
Uh, jim...

01:00.528 --> 01:04.530
What if --
what if we didn't slow down?

01:04.565 --> 01:08.334
What if we see
how fast we could go?

01:08.369 --> 01:11.370
Where we wake up
every morning

01:11.405 --> 01:15.608
Ready to test the limits
of our own pleasure.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.843
I hear you
loud and clear.

01:17.878 --> 01:21.246
You really
want to be a mommy.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.514
I get it.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.317
Jim, we need to talk.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.152
Darling, we will,
i promise.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.855
Just as soon as i get back
from this road trip

01:29.890 --> 01:31.156
In three weeks, okay?

01:31.192 --> 01:32.925
All right.
We'll talk then.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.994
All right.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.137
Okay.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.338
I love you.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.573
I love you.

01:54.849 --> 01:57.216
Lucy?

02:04.425 --> 02:06.458
What the hell
are you doing here?

02:06.494 --> 02:11.797
I saw a clip of you on tv
calling a home run, and...

02:11.832 --> 02:14.199
I tracked you down.

02:14.235 --> 02:19.605
You just vanished
after the press conference,

02:19.640 --> 02:22.207
And i-i looked
everywhere for you.

02:22.243 --> 02:25.210
I finally had to declare you
legally dead

02:25.246 --> 02:26.845
Just to get a divorce.

02:26.881 --> 02:29.281
You know, i was clinically dead
for three minutes

02:29.316 --> 02:31.116
In a brothel
in macedonia one time.

02:31.152 --> 02:33.085
But those girls,
they're pros.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.454
They -- they keep
those paddles handy.

02:35.489 --> 02:40.359
Mm. Jesus, jim.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.995
I feel terrible
that i hurt you.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.533
Um...Okay.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.568
Well, that's
ancient history.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.704
Really,
water under the bridge.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.739
Uh, my life
is fantastic now.

02:53.774 --> 02:57.309
My broadcasting career is back
on track, as you have seen.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.078
These people,
these are all my friends.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.079
I'm doing good.

03:00.114 --> 03:02.014
Look, there's, uh --
hey, smitty.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.182
And old, uh, doofer.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.017
And hey,
there's old two legs.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.152
Look at that, two legs.
There he is.

03:08.956 --> 03:09.988
My girlfriend.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.990
Julia james.
Look at that.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.959
I saved
the best for last.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.295
Like i do.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.730
Hi. Nice to meet you.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.598
Jules, lucy.
Lucy, jules.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.800
I will give you guys
some privacy.

03:21.836 --> 03:23.302
Okay.

03:28.342 --> 03:31.443
M-my life's good, see?
And -- and --

03:31.479 --> 03:35.414
With a capital "g,"
and that stands for "great."

03:36.283 --> 03:37.649
I'm so glad to hear it.

03:37.685 --> 03:40.385
I-i just -- i actually
came here to apologize.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.755
Well, then, by all means,
do continue.

03:42.790 --> 03:46.091
Well, when i found out
i was omnisexual,

03:46.127 --> 03:48.160
The floodgates opened

03:48.195 --> 03:53.065
And my boundaries
came down so fast.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.468
I just --
i could've handled it better.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.570
Oh, no.

03:58.606 --> 04:02.074
I'm sorry i wasn't honest
with you from the start.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.009
I hear you
loud and clear.

04:04.044 --> 04:07.446
You're sorry for being
such an awful nob-hungry tramp.

04:07.481 --> 04:11.083
Jim, i'm not apologizing
for my sex life.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.584
That's who i am.

04:12.620 --> 04:16.154
I'm apologizing
for keeping it a secret.

04:16.190 --> 04:19.625
I'm apologizing
for hiding my true self

04:19.660 --> 04:23.095
Like it was something
to be ashamed of.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.497
Okay, great.
Apology accepted.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.266
All good.
Thank you.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.901
Really?

04:28.936 --> 04:32.204
Because i still think you're
holding onto a lot of anger,

04:32.239 --> 04:35.574
And i wanted to give you
the chance to unload on me.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.477
Wouldn't be the first time
that happened today.

04:43.417 --> 04:47.052
I can see you're not ready to,
uh, joke about that yet, so...

04:47.087 --> 04:48.387
I can joke about it.

04:48.422 --> 04:51.623
Guys cumming all over you.
Please, that's hilarious.

04:51.659 --> 04:54.126
Hey, i have moved on.
I told you that.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.627
It's not like
you reduced me

04:55.663 --> 04:57.529
To some kind of
emotionally crippled,

04:57.565 --> 04:59.765
Incandescent ball
of hatred or anything.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.701
Come on now.
So...

05:02.736 --> 05:04.236
Yeah!

05:04.271 --> 05:08.340
Well, if you change your mind
and you do want to talk,

05:08.375 --> 05:11.977
I'll be here for a few days
at the marlowe inn.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.313
Room 114.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.215
Okay. All right.

05:16.250 --> 05:20.018
Well -- well, hey, you know,
if you have company,

05:20.054 --> 05:22.387
Do lock the door
this time.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.325
Now i'm the one
who's joking about it.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.609
Ha!

05:54.188 --> 05:57.089
oh, man!

05:58.893 --> 06:00.993
Was that ever
a non-event.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.398
I think it's possible

06:06.433 --> 06:09.968
That you're in a little bit
of denial about this.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.906
Last night you said
you wanted to kill her.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.474
Yeah, well,
i got better.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.509
Funny how life works out,
isn't it?

06:17.544 --> 06:18.443
Hey.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.811
We need to talk
about this.

06:19.847 --> 06:23.582
It's unhealthy to --
to keep your emotions inside.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.984
When i ran
into my ex, i-i --

06:26.020 --> 06:27.753
A lot of feelings
got stirred up,

06:27.788 --> 06:29.221
So i-i wrote him
a letter.

06:29.256 --> 06:30.255
Then what?

06:30.291 --> 06:31.590
You -- you didn't
send it, right?

06:31.625 --> 06:32.758
Of course i sent it.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.993
I frickin' hand delivered it
to his ass

06:35.029 --> 06:37.362
So i could watch him cry
while he read it.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.231
You have a great deal
of anger inside you.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.799
You aware of that?
No, i don't.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.367
The whole point
of what i'm saying

06:42.403 --> 06:44.269
Is that i purged
all the negative emotions

06:44.305 --> 06:45.070
Once and for all.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.538
Mm, i don't know.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.740
Like three months after that,
remember, you locked yourself

06:48.776 --> 06:50.842
In the back room
and you were crying a lot?

06:50.878 --> 06:54.079
And then also your drinking
just really hit next level.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.114
Since then, you've kind of
only been dating guys

06:56.150 --> 06:57.482
You can't have
a future with.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.084
Bingo!
Thank you!

06:59.119 --> 07:01.386
I was wondering why you
were attracted to me.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.587
Now i see it.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.823
No, you're just as dysfunctional
and damaged as i am.

07:04.858 --> 07:05.924
No.
You just --

07:05.960 --> 07:07.092
No, you do better
mask work or something.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.393
You -- you know
what you're doing?

07:08.429 --> 07:10.062
You're deflecting right now.
You're deflecting.

07:10.097 --> 07:13.765
You and i are not
on the same level of damage.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.168
Darling, we are both
sprinting to outrun

07:16.203 --> 07:19.104
God's sniper rifle,
knowing that if we turn around,

07:19.139 --> 07:20.906
We're gonna
stumble and die.

07:20.941 --> 07:21.873
No.
Yeah.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.141
No.
Yeah.

07:23.177 --> 07:25.510
That is not what i'm doing.
I am normal and healthy.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.611
Mm.
And you --

07:26.647 --> 07:28.714
Please. Then why are you
with me, huh?

07:28.749 --> 07:29.915
Because i'm slumming.

07:37.591 --> 07:42.894
So, uh, how are you
handling lucy being in town?

07:42.930 --> 07:45.630
Like i keep telling everybody,
i'm fine.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.065
Really?
Mm-hmm.

07:47.101 --> 07:49.501
'cause, um,
word around town

07:49.536 --> 07:53.005
Is she's at some hotel
taking in all comers.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.306
That's the word around --

07:54.341 --> 07:56.575
That's just common
knowledge, huh?
Yeah.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.210
look, this obsession

07:58.245 --> 08:00.712
That you and jules
have with lucy, i'm serious,

08:00.748 --> 08:03.382
It -- it says more about you
than it does me, okay?

08:03.417 --> 08:06.051
I mean, physician,
heal thyself.

08:07.621 --> 08:12.157
Frackers up at bat now.
<i>Here comes the payoff pitch.</i>

08:12.192 --> 08:15.627
<i>Folks, the frackers have</i>
<i>not beaten the butler barons</i>

08:15.662 --> 08:17.295
In their last 15
straight meetings.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.865
Boy, that -- that's got to stick
in your craw, doesn't it?

08:19.900 --> 08:22.134
<i>You know, they say the air</i>
<i>is actually different</i>

08:22.169 --> 08:23.468
Over there in butler.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.904
Sure, it's because
there's less sulfur,

08:25.939 --> 08:29.107
But it's also because of
an actual air of superiority.

08:29.143 --> 08:31.510
Driving around
in their chevy impalas,

08:31.545 --> 08:33.645
Eating at their
nicer applebee's.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.913
<i>It's like they think</i>

08:34.948 --> 08:36.681
<i>They're better than we are</i>
<i>or something.</i>

08:36.717 --> 08:38.250
they act like

08:38.284 --> 08:40.385
They're genetically
superior to us,

08:40.421 --> 08:42.821
<i>Like they're some kind</i>
<i>of a master race.</i>

08:42.856 --> 08:45.924
Gosh, where have i heard
that before?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.059
<i>Folks, true story.</i>

08:47.094 --> 08:49.127
<i>Back in the days</i>
<i>of the mill strikes</i>

08:49.163 --> 08:50.395
<i>When your grandfathers</i>

08:50.431 --> 08:52.364
<i>And your</i>
<i>great-great-grandfathers</i>

08:52.399 --> 08:53.799
Carried picket signs,

08:53.834 --> 08:56.868
It was folks from butler who
scabbed and stole those jobs,

08:56.904 --> 08:59.571
And i mean right out
from under your ancestors.

08:59.606 --> 09:02.374
Butler is a bad, bad place.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.743
Jim.
Jim, that's not true.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.478
Shut up.
It feels true.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.146
<i>All right, uribe up now.</i>

09:08.182 --> 09:09.581
Come on, uribe!

09:10.717 --> 09:12.184
<i>Little dribbler</i>
<i>up the left side.</i>

09:12.219 --> 09:14.186
<i>Throw comes up the line...</i>

09:14.221 --> 09:17.289
<i>Oh, the humanity!</i>
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

09:18.892 --> 09:21.893
<i>Not since pearl harbor</i>
<i>has america seen</i>

09:21.929 --> 09:24.663
<i>Such unprovoked aggression,</i>
<i>people!</i>

09:24.698 --> 09:27.265
First they take
our women...'s college,

09:27.301 --> 09:29.935
Then they poison
our children, probably,

09:29.970 --> 09:32.337
And now they attack
a veteran who served

09:32.372 --> 09:35.507
Three full tours of duty
in the major leagues.

09:35.542 --> 09:38.877
People, we have run out
of cheeks to turn, people!

09:38.912 --> 09:40.545
We're fresh out of them!

09:40.581 --> 09:43.081
<i>All right,</i>
<i>time for the 4th.</i>

09:43.117 --> 09:46.251
Morristown, morristown.
Do we have any dignity left?

09:46.286 --> 09:47.752
Well, the answer to that

09:47.788 --> 09:50.455
Lies in the hands
of a japanese millionaire

09:50.491 --> 09:52.924
<i>Who may not speak</i>
<i>any english,</i>

09:52.960 --> 09:55.927
<i>But he speaks</i>
<i>the language of baseball.</i>

09:55.963 --> 09:59.564
And he knows exactly
what to say next.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.435
Say it, say it,
say it, say it.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.942
Let's go, baby!

10:10.978 --> 10:13.311
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

10:13.347 --> 10:15.981
Uribe!
Get his ass!

10:16.016 --> 10:17.149
Justice!

10:17.184 --> 10:20.485
Sweet justice has finally
come to morristown!

10:20.521 --> 10:22.053
<i>Hallelujah, baby!</i>

10:22.089 --> 10:24.122
Whoo!
Now,<i> that's</i> baseball!

10:24.158 --> 10:25.590
Whoo!

10:31.297 --> 10:32.130
Morris!

10:32.166 --> 10:33.165
Town!

10:33.200 --> 10:34.032
Morris!

10:34.068 --> 10:35.233
Town!

10:35.269 --> 10:37.502
Okay, there's a very ugly vibe
in this crowd.

10:37.538 --> 10:39.004
Are you not
worried at all?

10:39.039 --> 10:40.272
Oh, what's to be worried?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.107
It's a stadium full
of enthusiastic

10:42.142 --> 10:43.708
And knowledgeable
baseball --

10:43.744 --> 10:46.278
I'm gonna kill someone today!
It's gonna be awesome!

10:46.313 --> 10:48.713
Lucy?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.348
Oh, i hope you
don't mind.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.751
I always love listening
to you call a game.

10:52.786 --> 10:53.885
No, no.

10:53.921 --> 10:56.354
I hope you and your cadre
of sexual weirdos

10:56.390 --> 10:57.856
Really enjoy the game.

10:57.891 --> 11:01.193
I'll tell you what,
it should be a real humdinger.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.563
We didn't get a chance
to meet properly earlier.

11:04.598 --> 11:05.697
I'm lucy.

11:05.732 --> 11:09.067
His, uh, horrible monster
of an ex-wife.

11:09.103 --> 11:12.237
I'm jules, his current
drunk of a girlfriend.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.339
Good to meet you.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.341
Thanks again
for those tickets.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.175
My pleasure.

11:17.211 --> 11:18.076
Have fun.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.911
Let's have
some hot dogs, guys!

11:27.421 --> 11:30.055
So, you sent them
tickets?

11:30.090 --> 11:34.292
Did you do that to help jim
or to cause a riot?

11:34.328 --> 11:35.427
Mm.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.062
Yes.

11:41.602 --> 11:43.301

<i>Testing, one, two, three.</i>

11:43.337 --> 11:45.403
<i>Testing, one, two,</i>
<i>nine, people --</i>

11:45.439 --> 11:46.571
<i>One, two, nine.</i>

11:46.607 --> 11:48.540
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>yesterday's hijinks</i>

11:48.575 --> 11:51.543
<i>Really boosted attendance,</i>
<i>so hello, all you fight fans,</i>

11:51.578 --> 11:53.411
And welcome
to morristown stadium

11:53.447 --> 11:55.714
For the second frame
in a four-game series

11:55.749 --> 11:58.650
<i>Between your morristown</i>
<i>frackers and the butler barons.</i>

11:58.685 --> 12:01.753
Oh, boy, did the frackers
beat up on those barons

12:01.788 --> 12:04.089
Pretty good yesterday,
didn't they?

12:05.993 --> 12:08.126
<i>I mean, literally.</i>

12:08.162 --> 12:09.661
You know, though,

12:09.696 --> 12:12.864
<i>As a completely</i>
<i>impartial observer,</i>

12:12.900 --> 12:15.700
I think i do understand
the frackers' anger.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.737
<i>You see,</i>
<i>i was in butler recently,</i>

12:18.772 --> 12:21.139
And you know
what i saw there, folks?

12:21.175 --> 12:23.608
I saw a man,
and he was beating a dog.

12:23.644 --> 12:26.378
He was beating it
on a public street corner.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.512
Just pounding it.

12:27.548 --> 12:29.614
While a mother
and her infant child

12:29.650 --> 12:31.783
Just watched
all of that and smiled.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.618
they just laughed.

12:33.654 --> 12:34.886
I-i was so confused.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.189
I don't know, i guess
it's just the kind of town

12:37.224 --> 12:38.290
That butler is, huh?

12:38.325 --> 12:40.258
I mean,
who's been to butler, right?

12:40.294 --> 12:41.426
Who's with me on this?

12:41.461 --> 12:44.829
<i>Butler.</i>
<i>I mean, really.</i>

12:44.865 --> 12:46.798
Then after that
disturbing sight,

12:46.833 --> 12:49.401
I went to get some gas,
and inside the station

12:49.436 --> 12:51.970
Right next to the register,
there was a sign.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.239
It said, "take a penny,
leave a penny."

12:54.274 --> 12:57.409
So, if you think you smelled
the rot of communism, people,

12:57.444 --> 12:59.244
Well, that's just
the red wind

12:59.279 --> 13:01.546
Blowing in
from the township of butler.

13:04.685 --> 13:07.018
Butler, butler, butler!

13:07.054 --> 13:09.688
They truly are
our eternal enemy

13:09.723 --> 13:12.524
In a war
that will still be fought

13:12.559 --> 13:15.794
Long after we've left
this earth, people!

13:15.829 --> 13:17.596
Long afterwards!

13:17.631 --> 13:20.932
Frackers
want to thank you all

13:20.968 --> 13:23.501
For coming out
to 50-cent-beer day.

13:23.537 --> 13:27.239
<i>Remind you all to please,</i>
<i>please drink responsibly.</i>

13:27.274 --> 13:29.174
<i>Ooh! Oh, my!</i>

13:29.209 --> 13:31.643
<i>Here we go again!</i>

13:32.813 --> 13:36.114
It has begun, people!

13:38.252 --> 13:39.618
Oh, daddy!

13:50.038 --> 13:52.205
Hey! Hey, buddy.

13:52.241 --> 13:54.140
You were right
about butler.

13:54.176 --> 13:56.109
Oh, my ex-wife
is from there,

13:56.144 --> 13:58.411
And sometimes
she would surprise me

13:58.447 --> 14:00.914
In the shower just to laugh
at my naked body.

14:01.950 --> 14:05.785
But hey,
you made baseball fun again!

14:05.821 --> 14:07.554
This is from me.

14:07.589 --> 14:08.889
Great.
Yes.

14:08.924 --> 14:10.524
Thanks a lot, hat man.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.192
Baseball?
What baseball?

14:12.227 --> 14:13.593
The game was a forfeit.

14:13.629 --> 14:17.364
Hey, i-i hope you didn't lose
too much at the gate there.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.599
Actually, the fans
that didn't get arrested

14:19.635 --> 14:20.767
Drank their asses off.

14:20.802 --> 14:22.869
I've got four garbage bags
full of dough

14:22.905 --> 14:24.170
Back at the stadium.

14:24.206 --> 14:25.805
Your rage is so contagious,

14:25.841 --> 14:28.375
I might be able to pay
my loan off early.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.076
Delighted
i can be of help.

14:30.112 --> 14:32.946
But you mean more to me
than a 45% spike in revenue,

14:32.981 --> 14:35.315
So i'm not gonna let you
call another game

14:35.350 --> 14:37.050
Until you figure out
your lucy shit.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.151
Aah!

14:38.186 --> 14:40.954
Ka-plop, ka-plop, ka-plop!
There he is!

14:40.989 --> 14:42.188
Our ringleader!

14:42.224 --> 14:44.558
You made us proud to be
from morristown again.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.860
Oh.
Anyway, we got you
a little something

14:46.895 --> 14:48.194
As a way of saying thanks.

14:48.230 --> 14:49.229
Come on.
Hey!

14:49.264 --> 14:50.130
Move it!

14:50.165 --> 14:52.165
Make way for the king!

14:52.200 --> 14:54.734
Move it! Move it!
All right.

14:54.770 --> 14:56.269
Move your big ass!

14:56.305 --> 14:58.605
Ta-da!

14:58.640 --> 15:00.307
Jesus --

15:00.342 --> 15:02.342
Is that
their third-base coach?

15:02.377 --> 15:03.677
Who gives a shit?

15:03.712 --> 15:05.645
We caught his ass trying
to get over the outfield fence.

15:05.681 --> 15:08.114
But he's all yours now.

15:08.150 --> 15:10.283
What you want to do
with him?

15:12.354 --> 15:14.988
Let him go.

15:15.023 --> 15:16.389
What?

15:16.425 --> 15:21.194
Dale,
let him go, please.

15:21.229 --> 15:25.231
All right, boys,
let him go.

15:29.371 --> 15:30.403
Geez.

15:30.439 --> 15:34.307
Get your ass
back to butler.

15:34.343 --> 15:39.179
See, this is why people
think baseball's boring.

15:54.029 --> 15:56.162
[whip cracking,
handcuffs clicking]

15:56.198 --> 15:59.099
Jim. What is it?

15:59.134 --> 16:01.534
Um...Look,
i'm still angry.

16:01.570 --> 16:03.503
I'm -- i'm pretty angry.

16:05.907 --> 16:08.041
But i think
i'm ready to talk about it.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.080
[whip cracks,
handcuffs clicking]

16:13.116 --> 16:15.516
Um, well, should we go
inside your, uh...

16:15.551 --> 16:17.051
Yeah.
I don't think so.

16:17.086 --> 16:19.220
No, of course
we should not do that.

16:19.255 --> 16:21.756
Guys, we're gonna need
to take a hard five.

16:21.791 --> 16:24.258
There's gatorade and bananas
in the cooler.

16:24.293 --> 16:25.826
Need to hydrate!

16:25.862 --> 16:29.029
I'm so glad
that you are ready to talk.

16:30.066 --> 16:31.999
Look, just know
you're not gonna get

16:32.034 --> 16:33.968
What you want out of this,
all right?

16:34.003 --> 16:36.370
This is not gonna end
in hugs and forgiveness.

16:36.406 --> 16:38.406
Say what you
came here to say.

16:38.441 --> 16:40.841
When i walked
into our house that day,

16:40.877 --> 16:42.543
You broke me
into a million pieces.

16:42.578 --> 16:43.677
And ever since then,

16:43.713 --> 16:45.613
I've been trying
to put myself back together,

16:45.648 --> 16:47.281
But i just --
i can't do it. Okay?

16:47.316 --> 16:48.949
I'm like a plate
that got dropped.

16:48.985 --> 16:50.584
You try to glue it
back together,

16:50.620 --> 16:52.720
But some pieces, they're just --
they're gone.

16:53.790 --> 16:56.223
I will never be
whole again, ever.

16:56.259 --> 16:57.191
All right?

16:57.226 --> 16:59.026
I think one of those
missing pieces

16:59.061 --> 17:01.695
Has got to be forgiveness,
lucy, because try as i might,

17:01.731 --> 17:03.364
I just --
i cannot forgive you.

17:03.399 --> 17:05.199
I will <i> never</i> forgive you.

17:05.233 --> 17:08.769
All that i have left for you now
is hatred, okay?

17:08.805 --> 17:10.438
Just know,
wherever you are out there,

17:10.473 --> 17:12.071
Whatever the hell it is
you're doing,

17:12.108 --> 17:13.374
I'll be out there, too.

17:13.409 --> 17:15.376
I'm just a burning ember
of hatred

17:15.411 --> 17:17.111
Directed right at you,
okay?

17:17.146 --> 17:18.646
You're my true north.

17:18.681 --> 17:21.048
My hatred
will always find you.

17:26.255 --> 17:28.189
Great.

17:28.223 --> 17:29.190
Really great.

17:29.225 --> 17:31.358
Okay.
What does that mean, "great"?

17:31.394 --> 17:35.196
I am so glad that you
finally got to tell your truth,

17:35.231 --> 17:38.666
But i don't need
your forgiveness.

17:38.701 --> 17:41.268
For such a long time,
i thought the only thing

17:41.304 --> 17:43.804
That could make me happy
was being the woman

17:43.840 --> 17:46.507
That you wanted me to be,
but then you outed me,

17:46.542 --> 17:51.278
And i was forced to become
the person i wanted to be.

17:51.314 --> 17:56.484
And each day, i get to be
more and more myself,

17:56.519 --> 18:00.020
And it is sublime.

18:00.056 --> 18:03.190
Sublime? Really?
That's it?

18:03.226 --> 18:04.992
I mean,
you got to be kidding me.

18:05.027 --> 18:07.294
Okay, so, you get to live
happily ever after

18:07.330 --> 18:09.497
As the biggest frickin' dom
since deluise,

18:09.532 --> 18:11.499

for the rest of my days?

18:11.534 --> 18:13.701
I mean, come on!

I hope you find a way
to be content, jim.

18:16.239 --> 18:17.137
Do you?

18:17.173 --> 18:20.474
Oh, and, um,
don't wear your slippers

18:20.510 --> 18:23.210
In front
of your girlfriend.

18:23.246 --> 18:26.313
They make you look
like a dink.

18:29.285 --> 18:30.784

my slippers?
