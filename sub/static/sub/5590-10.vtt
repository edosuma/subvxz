07:55.685 --> 07:58.018
I'm sorry, rayna.

07:58.020 --> 08:01.855
¶¶

08:08.496 --> 08:09.828
This is crazy.
I'm not a country singer.

08:09.830 --> 08:10.662
And you're -- you're gonna
put me on a stage

08:10.664 --> 08:11.996
In the heart
of nashville.

08:11.998 --> 08:12.997
They're gonna see
right through me.

08:12.999 --> 08:14.164
Listen to me.

08:14.166 --> 08:15.999
They're not gonna
see through anything.

08:16.001 --> 08:19.135
Markus, this is the best music
you've ever done,

08:19.137 --> 08:21.704
And the country audience
is gonna love you for that.

08:21.706 --> 08:24.239
I mean, hell, I've invested all
this time and money into this.

08:24.241 --> 08:26.440
I believe in you.
You got to believe in you.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.344
Trust me?

08:31.346 --> 08:33.079
When are you gonna
ask her?

08:33.081 --> 08:35.815
Well, tomorrow night
at the opening.

08:35.817 --> 08:37.583
All our friends and family
are gonna be there --

08:37.585 --> 08:39.685
Your mama, too,
in spirit.

08:39.687 --> 08:40.819
Yeah.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.987
Seemed like a good time.

08:42.989 --> 08:45.222
Time to start
moving forward.

08:45.224 --> 08:47.424
Speaking of which,
I got to get you home.

08:47.426 --> 08:49.592
Let's go. Come on.
Oh, there's no rush.

08:49.594 --> 08:52.994
I could, like, stay and help
or hang or...Whatever.

08:54.263 --> 08:55.695
Look, I've been
on the road enough to know

08:55.697 --> 08:58.030
That the last place I'd want to
be when I first got back

08:58.032 --> 08:59.865
Is anywhere but home.

08:59.867 --> 09:02.868
Something
you want to tell me?

09:02.870 --> 09:04.870
Uh, just
last time I was home,

09:04.872 --> 09:07.572
Things were a little off
between caleb and I.

09:07.574 --> 09:08.673
That's all.

09:08.675 --> 09:10.941
Re-entry is always tough.

09:10.943 --> 09:13.043
All I can tell you is
the longer you put it off,

09:13.045 --> 09:15.311
The longer it's gonna take for
things to get back to normal.

09:17.748 --> 09:20.348
So, markus,
are you enjoying your time

09:20.350 --> 09:22.717
Here in nashville?
Oh, absolutely, nick.

09:22.719 --> 09:24.618
I mean, this -- this is
an incredible music town.

09:24.620 --> 09:28.021
You know, like, the talent here
is -- is really insane.

09:28.023 --> 09:29.856
My first week here,
I-I walk into this club

09:29.858 --> 09:31.090
In printer's alley,
you know,

09:31.092 --> 09:33.058
It's midnight
on a Tuesday,

09:33.060 --> 09:34.959
And these cats are
just killing it, you know?

09:34.961 --> 09:36.360
And -- and the music
never stops.

09:36.362 --> 09:37.694
It's like that everywhere,

09:37.696 --> 09:39.095
And I'm -- I'm --
I'm really in awe.

09:39.097 --> 09:40.596
He would come into the studio
in the morning,

09:40.598 --> 09:41.930
Just going on and on

09:41.932 --> 09:43.965
About whatever music he'd heard
the night before.

09:43.967 --> 09:45.733
[ chuckles ]
it really is inspiring,

09:45.735 --> 09:48.368
And I think you feel
that inspiration in the album.
Yeah.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.236
Listen, I'm looking forward
to this record,

09:50.238 --> 09:53.572
But some people are not taking
your little detour

09:53.574 --> 09:56.074
Into country music
particularly seriously.

09:56.076 --> 09:58.576
I mean, what do you say, markus,
to those critics

09:58.578 --> 10:01.512
Who think that all of this --
just a bit of a lark?

10:04.149 --> 10:06.115
Well, can I jump in
on that, please?

10:06.117 --> 10:07.282
Because that --
that makes me crazy

10:07.284 --> 10:08.549
When I hear
stuff like that.

10:08.551 --> 10:10.217
These days, there's not
that much difference

10:10.219 --> 10:12.886
Between country music and --
and boulevard.

10:12.888 --> 10:14.787
The lines are
really blurred.

10:14.789 --> 10:15.888
Frankly,
this is the best music

10:15.890 --> 10:17.456
We've ever heard
from markus keen.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.991
It's the most authentic,
and all I can say

10:19.993 --> 10:21.926
Is everybody can download
the album tonight

10:21.928 --> 10:22.826
And hear for themselves.

10:22.828 --> 10:24.427
Rayna jaymes,
markus keen,

10:24.429 --> 10:26.262
Thank you very much
for being with us this morning.

10:26.264 --> 10:28.264
And don't forget
you can download markus'

10:28.266 --> 10:34.235
Brand-new album tonight,
starting 8:00 p.M. Eastern time.

10:34.237 --> 10:36.904
We can't find any irregularities
with the label

10:36.906 --> 10:39.239
Or any wheelin' dealin'
investments.

10:39.241 --> 10:41.441
But he embezzled
from your personal finances

10:41.443 --> 10:44.143
And tried to cover it up
by filing false returns.

10:44.145 --> 10:45.777
$40 million?

10:45.779 --> 10:46.978
All right, so,
how do we handle it?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.013
Honestly?
Bankruptcy.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.280
[ laughs ]

10:50.282 --> 10:52.315
At least then you could protect
some of your assets.

10:52.317 --> 10:54.283
No, the most important thing
to protect right now

10:54.285 --> 10:57.352
Is the brand,
and "bankruptcy" is an ugly word

10:57.354 --> 10:58.619
When it comes
to business.

10:58.621 --> 11:01.355
Agreed,
but so are "back taxes."

11:01.357 --> 11:03.857
We need to handle this as
quickly and quietly as possible.

11:03.859 --> 11:05.491
Can you pay it,
make it go away?

11:05.493 --> 11:06.658
I don't care
how rich you are,

11:06.660 --> 11:08.626
Nobody's got money like that
just sitting around.

11:08.628 --> 11:10.527
So, what do we do?

11:10.529 --> 11:12.262
Well, with bankruptcy
off the table,

11:12.264 --> 11:14.931
I suggest we start
liquidating assets,

11:14.933 --> 11:16.332
Convert as many as we can
into cash.

11:16.334 --> 11:18.500
Do it.

11:18.502 --> 11:21.669
Sell everything and anything
that won't draw attention.

11:26.475 --> 11:27.974
Hey.
Hi.

11:27.976 --> 11:29.342
Thought
you were working?

11:29.344 --> 11:32.011
I was, but I got dr. Kurihara
to cover my patients

11:32.013 --> 11:32.845
For the rest of the day.

11:32.847 --> 11:34.279

[ inhales deeply ]
'cause I didn't want

11:35.615 --> 11:37.314
To make the same mistake
that I made the last time.

11:37.316 --> 11:38.648
That wasn't your fault.
That was mine.

11:38.650 --> 11:39.949
I surprised you,
and then I carried on about it.

11:39.951 --> 11:41.317
Hey, hey, well,
let's just forget

11:41.319 --> 11:43.452
About the last time
and start over.

11:43.454 --> 11:45.720
I love you.

11:50.059 --> 11:51.558
Should I get
a restraining order?

11:51.560 --> 11:53.526
No, but you should
calm down.

11:53.528 --> 11:55.628
Okay. [ sighs ]

11:55.630 --> 11:57.997
If she reached out to emily,
it's only a matter of time

11:57.999 --> 11:59.498
Till she shows up
on my doorstep,

11:59.500 --> 12:01.700
And I don't want her
anywhere near cadence.

12:01.702 --> 12:03.301
And that's
your decision to make.

12:03.303 --> 12:05.336
Juliette signed the papers
terminating her parental rights,

12:05.338 --> 12:07.004
And she did so
of her own volition.

12:07.006 --> 12:08.472
What if she brings
this doctor into it?

12:08.474 --> 12:09.739
What if they try to say

12:09.741 --> 12:11.340
That she was mentally
incompetent or something?

12:11.342 --> 12:12.641
Avery, listen to me.

12:12.643 --> 12:15.977
You have the power
in this situation -- all of it.

12:18.915 --> 12:20.748
Are you sure
it's not booked?

12:20.750 --> 12:23.183
My publisher was supposed
to call and make a reservation.

12:23.185 --> 12:25.752
I'm really sorry, sir, but
I'm not seeing it in the system.

12:25.754 --> 12:27.153
Could it be under
another name?

12:27.155 --> 12:29.889

or lexington, then --

You ready to work?

12:32.326 --> 12:34.192
No. [ sighs ]

12:34.194 --> 12:37.094
Looks like casey forgot to call,
so we don't have a room.

Hang on, um...

12:39.531 --> 12:40.930

12:40.932 --> 12:42.331
I bet you we could use
his music studio.

12:42.333 --> 12:45.033
Forget it. Why don't we
go back to the house?

12:45.035 --> 12:46.934
We can work there.

12:46.936 --> 12:48.402

your wife won't mind?

be saying?

It's gonna take thousands
of people to fill this space.

17:34.057 --> 17:35.122
You know,
I got to admit,

17:35.124 --> 17:36.823
I didn't think
he could pull it off.

17:36.825 --> 17:38.257
But he's good.

17:38.259 --> 17:39.591
Yeah.

17:39.593 --> 17:41.659
Yeah, he's good,
all right.

He didn't make you use
the back entrance?

18:11.819 --> 18:13.485
[ chuckles ] no.

18:13.487 --> 18:15.687
Right through the front door,
just like a normal person,

18:15.689 --> 18:17.755
And he said we could work
at the house from now on.

18:17.757 --> 18:18.956
You know,
I really think

18:18.958 --> 18:20.857
I'm starting to change his mind
about things.

18:20.859 --> 18:22.959
You know, if I can get
a guy like wade cole

18:22.961 --> 18:25.261
To be more accepting...
Who knows?

18:25.263 --> 18:27.496
Maybe there is hope for
a gay artist in country music.

Well, hear, hear.
[ chuckles ]

18:29.500 --> 18:30.932
Hey, where's emily?

18:30.934 --> 18:32.099
I thought she was
coming around today.

18:32.101 --> 18:33.967
She's still not into you
if that's what you're after.

18:33.969 --> 18:35.368
No.

18:35.370 --> 18:36.836
But she's -- she's family.

18:36.838 --> 18:37.970
She should
come hang with us.

18:37.972 --> 18:38.770
I'll give her a call.

18:38.772 --> 18:40.705
I-I wouldn't do that.

18:40.707 --> 18:42.106
Why not?

18:42.108 --> 18:43.640
Because I fired her.

18:43.642 --> 18:45.375
What?!
You can't fire emily.

18:45.377 --> 18:46.509
Are you serious?!
She's<i> emily.</i>

18:46.511 --> 18:48.143
Look, I just found out

18:48.145 --> 18:50.945
That she's been talking to
juliette behind my back, okay?

18:50.947 --> 18:52.446
And then she had the nerve
to come over here

18:52.448 --> 18:54.014
And try to get me
to feel sorry for it.

18:54.016 --> 18:55.715
Emily is supposed to be
on our side.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.217
Listen, avery, I know
I've missed some stuff here,

18:58.219 --> 19:00.319
But don't you think you're being
a little harsh?

19:00.321 --> 19:03.322
No. Look, you guys don't know
juliette like I do.

19:03.324 --> 19:05.290
It's<i> because</i>
emily's so nice

19:05.292 --> 19:07.992
That juliette's using her
to get what she wants,

19:07.994 --> 19:10.160
And that means
I can't trust emily anymore,

19:10.162 --> 19:13.296
And I don't want her
anywhere near cadence, okay?

19:13.298 --> 19:15.064
No.
It's not okay.

19:15.066 --> 19:18.233
Emily is a way better influence
on cadence than any of us.

19:19.636 --> 19:20.735
Including you.

19:20.737 --> 19:22.903
Get her back, dude,
all right?

19:22.905 --> 19:25.405
Say you're sorry.
Admit you're a crazy person.

19:25.407 --> 19:28.040
Just...
Just get her back.

19:32.912 --> 19:35.312
So, I got
some good news recently.

19:35.314 --> 19:37.247
Hmm?

19:37.249 --> 19:39.382
A job offer.

19:39.384 --> 19:41.817
Promotion, actually.
Hmm.

19:41.819 --> 19:44.319
I would be the head
of my own department.

19:45.922 --> 19:48.856
That's incredible!
Why didn't you say anything?

19:48.858 --> 19:50.557
Well, I didn't think
I was gonna get it.

19:50.559 --> 19:52.025
When they called,
I was shocked.

19:52.027 --> 19:53.559
I'm not.
I knew you were amazing.

19:54.895 --> 19:56.261
Well done.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.695
There's a catch.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.996
It's in seattle.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.198
[ chuckles ]
we live in nashville.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.734
Um...Plenty of country stars
live in other states.

20:04.736 --> 20:07.336
I'm part of a duo, though,
so it's not just about me.

20:07.338 --> 20:09.571
Uh, s-sorry,
how would that even work?

20:09.573 --> 20:13.341
Well, I know that I-I blindsided
you with this, so...

20:13.343 --> 20:16.110
We obviously have
some things to figure out.
Yeah.

20:16.112 --> 20:17.778
So, let's just, uh, let's --
let's sleep on it.

20:17.780 --> 20:19.045
We don't need
to decide anything tonight.

another hour here.

20:31.925 --> 20:33.724

when I get home, too.

No!

Bucky, I am so sorry,

20:45.967 --> 20:47.232
But I got to borrow
my label head for one second.

20:47.234 --> 20:48.533
Wait,
what are we doing?

Trust me.

Well, I wanted to take you back
to where it all began,

20:59.209 --> 21:01.776
But I couldn't find
a 737, so...

21:01.778 --> 21:03.744
Aww.
...This will have to do.

To rayna jaymes,
an incredible woman who...

21:12.785 --> 21:15.719
Saw more in me
than I ever saw in myself.

21:15.721 --> 21:17.787
For that,
I'm grateful, really.

21:17.789 --> 21:19.288
Well, thank you.

21:19.290 --> 21:20.956
The album is amazing.

Tonight was incredible!

Why? W-what's
the big deal?

21:39.102 --> 21:40.301
We talked about this!

21:40.303 --> 21:41.335
If we're gonna
work together,

21:41.337 --> 21:42.402
You've got to respect me,

21:42.404 --> 21:43.802
Respect my boundaries.

turn down the job.

to leave you.

this is a pretty easy decision.

such a great night.
It was amazing.

after all that hard work.

You were right.

That markus isn't
so bad after all.

Well, I wouldn't go that far
[chuckles] but...

23:10.802 --> 23:13.035
What does that mean?

23:13.037 --> 23:15.837
Oh, nothing.
It does not bear repeating.

23:15.839 --> 23:17.805
Seriously, what?

23:17.807 --> 23:20.974
Well, I mean, after that whole
conversation I had with him,

23:20.976 --> 23:23.343
He still tries to kiss me at the
end of the night last night.

23:23.345 --> 23:25.411
Could anybody be that stupid,
you know?

23:25.413 --> 23:26.745

under control, okay?

It doesn't seem like you have it
under control, rayna!

supposed to mean?!
I'm just saying --

What are you doing?

23:53.498 --> 23:55.931
He kissed me!
I didn't kiss him!

There's nothing for us
to be fighting about.

However, if he cancels
this tour, this album is dead!

to markus right now!

Some stupid kiss.

I'm sorry, but...

25:38.445 --> 25:39.644
No.
...I got to go.

25:39.646 --> 25:40.945
No, look, we started
this journey together

25:40.947 --> 25:42.913
Because you wanted
to stand on your own.

25:42.915 --> 25:44.481
You wanted to be heard,
you know?

25:44.483 --> 25:46.182
Don't go back from that.

We lost ford and walmart.

26:00.961 --> 26:02.260
It's only a matter of time
before we lose the rest.

26:02.262 --> 26:03.694
Wait, hold on a second.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.195
I thought you said
we had it under control.

did some digging

26:07.299 --> 26:08.598
After your fight
with colt.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.132
He found out
about the taxes somehow.

26:10.134 --> 26:11.766
The piece is gonna be
a hatchet job!

26:11.768 --> 26:13.334
No, I paid it all back.

26:13.336 --> 26:15.336
Did you tell them
I paid it back?
It doesn't matter!

26:15.338 --> 26:17.705
The perception is that
luke wheeler is either too dumb

26:17.707 --> 26:19.940
Or too rich to notice
that $40 million is missing,

26:19.942 --> 26:21.808
And neither is
a good option for business.

26:21.810 --> 26:23.976
Everything I've done is
to protect this brand!

26:23.978 --> 26:26.311
Hell, I even lost
my own son because of it --

26:26.313 --> 26:29.280
Because you keep insisting
that this<i> brand</i> come first!

26:29.282 --> 26:30.714
I mean,
you were the one who --

26:30.716 --> 26:32.282
Who told us we shouldn't talk
to the police!

26:32.284 --> 26:34.117
You were the one
who wanted colt to lie!

26:34.119 --> 26:35.785
You're telling me
it was all for nothing?!

26:35.787 --> 26:37.386
Don't you dare
stand there

26:37.388 --> 26:39.354
And tell me
that this is<i> my</i> fault!

26:39.356 --> 26:41.856
It was my job
to protect the brand.

26:41.858 --> 26:44.191
It's<i> your</i> job
to protect your son.

26:44.193 --> 26:45.525
And for the record,

26:45.527 --> 26:48.027
Your tax problems started
long before we met,

26:48.029 --> 26:50.829
So if anybody has the right to
be angry here, it's me.

26:50.831 --> 26:52.997
I'm the one who bet
on the wrong horse.

26:52.999 --> 26:56.366

done cleaning up your messes.

35:27.127 --> 35:29.961
I feel so guilty.

35:29.963 --> 35:32.697
I asked gunnar if he thought
we could still do the band

35:32.699 --> 35:34.565
If I moved to seattle.

35:34.567 --> 35:36.567
And what'd he say?

He said if it made me happy,
we could make it work.

[ voice breaking ]
it's what I couldn't say to you.

35:44.741 --> 35:47.241
Scarlett,
we already settled this.

I'm not taking the job.
You have to.

You're brilliant
at what you do.

35:56.651 --> 35:59.585
I can't allow you to throw away
everything you've dreamed,

35:59.587 --> 36:01.520
Everything you've worked for
for me

36:01.522 --> 36:03.488
When I cannot do
the same thing for you.

You're breaking up
with me?

36:07.827 --> 36:09.293

36:09.295 --> 36:12.396
You deserve someone
who will follow you anywhere.

36:12.398 --> 36:15.332
Well, I should've
known better.

36:15.334 --> 36:17.334
[ scoffs ] the way
this whole thing started,

36:17.336 --> 36:19.502
You needed a doctor to lean on
and not a boyfriend.

36:19.504 --> 36:21.337
If it weren't
for deacon's cancer,

36:21.339 --> 36:23.238
You wouldn't have given
a guy like me a second thought.

I'm not one of you.

36:25.075 --> 36:27.408

I'm sorry.

I'm very, very sorry.

36:32.448 --> 36:35.248
You can pack your things
when I'm at work tomorrow.

You leave your key
by the door.

Thanks for coming over.
[ sighs ]

36:43.755 --> 36:45.755
To be honest,
I wasn't sure you would.

36:45.757 --> 36:48.290
Avery, nothing's
changed between us.

36:48.292 --> 36:50.692
I know you think it has,
but I'm still the same person.

36:50.694 --> 36:53.294
I know, and I'm sorry.

36:53.296 --> 36:55.362
It's just [sighs]

36:55.364 --> 36:57.831
I'm furious with juliette,
and I took it out on you.

36:57.833 --> 37:00.133
I get it.
You don't trust juliette.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.802
And given her track record,
I don't blame you.

37:02.804 --> 37:05.204
Juliette has to
prove herself,

37:05.206 --> 37:07.940
But she needs cadence
in order to do that.

37:07.942 --> 37:11.543
Okay, so...
How would this even work?

37:11.545 --> 37:13.177
Y-you'd take cadence
over there,

37:13.179 --> 37:14.945
The doctor
would supervise the visit,

37:14.947 --> 37:16.513
And then you'd --
you'd bring her right back?

37:16.515 --> 37:18.114
If that's
what you want, yes.

37:18.116 --> 37:19.548
You can promise me

37:19.550 --> 37:21.016
That cadence would never
be alone with her,

37:21.018 --> 37:22.484
That you'd be in the room
the whole time?

37:22.486 --> 37:23.451
I promise.

37:25.788 --> 37:27.320
Okay.

37:27.322 --> 37:28.954
You can tell dr. Kitley

37:28.956 --> 37:30.956
That I agree
to supervised visits,

37:30.958 --> 37:33.458
But the termination of
parental rights stays in effect.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.060
Absolutely.

37:36.062 --> 37:38.028
You're doing
the right thing.

Then you've wasted a trip.

Listen, I didn't --
I didn't come to argue with you.

37:55.578 --> 37:56.677
I just need a minute.

It's okay, grandpa.

Hey.

Look, I don't know
how to say it, um...

38:09.889 --> 38:13.223

and I'm sorry.

38:13.225 --> 38:17.493
And just...Please come home.

Don't uproot your whole life

What's wrong between us
can't be fixed.

Yeah, it can.

A-and I never should've gone
down that road to begin with,

38:36.775 --> 38:38.241
And I sure as hell
shouldn't have made it

Just start over, okay?
