01:21.137 --> 01:22.972
My dear daughter.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.377
The Unlights are coming.

01:28.378 --> 01:30.380
They are coming for our water,

01:31.414 --> 01:34.818
and you, our children.

01:36.786 --> 01:40.457
Because in you lies the un-mutated DNA

01:40.491 --> 01:43.127
which they will use to breed their army.

01:44.961 --> 01:47.831
This is why Mommy left.

01:47.865 --> 01:50.367
I have to fight them.

01:50.401 --> 01:53.570
So, I need you to understand,

01:53.604 --> 01:55.506
I need you to be brave.

01:57.173 --> 01:59.475
For if they come,

01:59.509 --> 02:02.511
they will ask you to make a choice,

02:02.545 --> 02:04.148
to choose a side.

02:05.649 --> 02:08.651
Instead, I need you to find your sister

02:08.685 --> 02:10.954
and then your father.

02:10.988 --> 02:13.422
I need you to help unlock the door,

02:13.456 --> 02:15.960
and make sure all three of you are safe.

02:16.994 --> 02:21.563
Then, I want you to walk into the blade

02:21.597 --> 02:23.366
like a big girl,

02:24.601 --> 02:27.437
with your eyes open,

02:27.471 --> 02:29.506
just like Mommy would.

03:08.011 --> 03:10.079
We are called to arm the ice mine

03:10.113 --> 03:12.147
assault.

03:12.181 --> 03:15.017
Base defense grid,
standby for a battery test.

03:15.051 --> 03:17.687
Roger that, authenticating now.

03:17.721 --> 03:19.154
Battery one, fire.

03:20.858 --> 03:22.192
Battery two, fire.

03:23.526 --> 03:24.493
Battery three, fire.

03:25.728 --> 03:27.597
Battery four, fire.

03:31.734 --> 03:33.836
Battery five, fire.

03:33.870 --> 03:35.538
Bashir and Easter company leaders,

03:35.572 --> 03:37.539
and staff sergeants get your battle suit,

03:37.573 --> 03:38.974
check out the compression.

03:39.008 --> 03:42.211
Bay six and seven, or preview orbit

03:42.245 --> 03:44.514
in ARCP safe inscription.

03:44.548 --> 03:46.182
Faltered on the south dark side

03:46.216 --> 03:49.519
so any other retaliation, will
most likely come from Earth.

03:49.553 --> 03:52.521
Set your firing profile to stable one.

03:52.555 --> 03:53.890
Click that.

03:53.924 --> 03:57.894
Let those godless chin
breathing sons of bitches come.

04:01.798 --> 04:03.599
Assault flight crews to deployment

04:03.633 --> 04:07.036
base seven for a full-up
pre-flight check, combat ready.

04:08.672 --> 04:10.573
Shingatsa Fear Monks to mission prep

04:10.607 --> 04:11.773
and weapons check up.

04:11.807 --> 04:15.211
Shingatsa Fear Monks to mission
prep, and weapons check up.

04:22.619 --> 04:25.654
Agent-General Zadie, Captain Tyson to ops,

04:25.688 --> 04:28.758
south dome, sub-level D.

04:40.970 --> 04:43.139
And fuck you.

04:46.609 --> 04:48.311
Assault strike teams one and three,

04:48.345 --> 04:49.912
to assembly line.

04:49.946 --> 04:53.282
Assault strike teams two and
six to suit prep and weapons...

05:13.604 --> 05:16.940
Four, three, two, one.

05:18.741 --> 05:19.909
Ops crew in

05:19.943 --> 05:21.344
- deployment base seven.
- Boom.

05:21.378 --> 05:23.145
Deployment base six, do a weapon systems

05:23.179 --> 05:25.847
check in CDL lockup.

05:25.881 --> 05:28.818
Ares and Chago company,
report to mess hall,

05:28.852 --> 05:31.955
west half level four.

05:38.328 --> 05:40.729
What the hell man!

05:40.763 --> 05:42.164
Man that motherfucker is crazy!

05:42.198 --> 05:44.633
You stole my yobbin' dessert, you putz!

05:44.667 --> 05:47.203
Man I wouldn't even let
the enemy eat this shit.

05:48.672 --> 05:50.107
Oh...

05:51.374 --> 05:53.308
Well, you gonna eat yours then?

05:53.342 --> 05:54.376
You fucking psycho.

05:54.410 --> 05:55.878
Pre-combat mass will be held in

05:55.912 --> 05:58.981
north chapel dome 4 pad Charlie.

05:59.015 --> 06:01.818
All affiliations are welcome.

06:08.958 --> 06:10.993
Conserve air and water,

06:11.027 --> 06:14.763
remember to wear your
scrubber masks while sleeping.

06:14.797 --> 06:19.635
Women and girls of childbearing
age, you may be eligible

06:19.669 --> 06:21.137
for an extra quart of water.

06:21.171 --> 06:22.772
Hey Lang?

06:22.806 --> 06:24.674
Each week, so see a recruiter today.

06:24.708 --> 06:26.676
Sorry.

06:26.710 --> 06:29.113
They're showing Outlaw
Traveler 2 in the chapel.

06:31.181 --> 06:33.715
I snagged an extra ticket.

06:33.749 --> 06:35.619
I'm sure the artillery can wait.

06:40.090 --> 06:41.792
That's the problem.

06:43.794 --> 06:46.895
They all get used up so fast.

06:48.330 --> 06:49.899
Military contractor teams four,

06:49.933 --> 06:52.368
and eight, to assembly
area for weapon staging

06:52.402 --> 06:54.337
and battle suit prep.

06:54.371 --> 06:57.340
Weapons-bosses to
deployment base two and 11.

06:57.374 --> 06:58.373
Hey Dalton what do you think,

06:58.407 --> 07:01.210
the M19 or the M98?

07:01.244 --> 07:03.179
Leave it.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.383
It's gonna be a knife
fight in a phone booth.

07:07.417 --> 07:09.385
I'm gonna need you to bring
at least three headshredders

07:09.419 --> 07:10.820
and a few toe poppers.

07:10.854 --> 07:13.257
Ain't those against the rules?

07:16.760 --> 07:19.328
All pilots start pre-flight count down

07:19.362 --> 07:20.830
and weapons check.

07:20.864 --> 07:22.532
It ain't our war.

07:25.869 --> 07:27.337
It ain't our rules.

07:29.806 --> 07:31.274
And, I ain't dying for free.

07:31.308 --> 07:34.278
Station 3 fuel crews to staging area.

07:39.116 --> 07:41.851
Ground team leaders in
kegs one, three, and six

07:41.885 --> 07:45.488
to final mission briefing,
room 16A, south half,

07:45.522 --> 07:47.191
north tower.

07:54.297 --> 07:56.131
Assault strike team seven, standby

07:56.165 --> 07:58.935
for decomp test and combat certification.

07:58.969 --> 08:01.137
Sniper crews, the latest recon footage

08:01.171 --> 08:02.871
has been uploaded to BaseNet,

08:02.905 --> 08:04.941
download and disseminate now.

08:11.547 --> 08:15.017
Hey Machine, transport leaves at one.

08:15.051 --> 08:16.987
On it.

08:21.891 --> 08:23.859
Tower to 727, we're showing tanks

08:23.893 --> 08:24.828
are completely pressurized,

08:24.862 --> 08:27.929
you are a go on full
internal power at the 15.

08:27.963 --> 08:29.030
Roger that.

08:29.064 --> 08:30.900
I have an assault leader go from

08:30.934 --> 08:32.768
the cargo hold, I'm rollin' back the doors.

08:35.172 --> 08:36.806
Oxidation looks good.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.975
Click that, main engines at standby.

08:40.009 --> 08:41.409
Flash shields locked.

08:42.845 --> 08:44.846
You're looking good on the ascent, 727.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.916
Click that, we have a good bird,

08:46.950 --> 08:48.184
no residuals.

08:49.885 --> 08:51.554
Good hunting and click
to the Almighty Outlaw.

08:51.588 --> 08:52.589
Click to the Outlaw.

08:52.623 --> 08:55.359
And bring us back some water.

08:58.195 --> 09:00.396
Hey, 7-2-7, welcome
to the party.

09:00.430 --> 09:03.166
They got you chasing ice cubes too?

09:03.200 --> 09:06.067
Ground scan radar on and pinging active.

09:15.878 --> 09:17.113
Hey, 200,

09:17.147 --> 09:18.848
who'd you pay to pull weed?

09:18.882 --> 09:20.182
Check the flight plan,

09:20.216 --> 09:24.119
I'm carrying mercenaries and Fear monks.

09:24.153 --> 09:26.421
Let's close it up kids, radio silence

09:26.455 --> 09:27.556
until touchdown.

09:39.268 --> 09:41.970
Transitioning from ORC to OPS One.

09:42.004 --> 09:43.873
Feed lines are good.

09:57.052 --> 10:00.056
MCT, go for pitch maneuver.

10:00.090 --> 10:01.923
Horizontal trail is now cold.

10:01.957 --> 10:04.627
Five feet per second.

10:04.661 --> 10:05.994
88, 80.

10:06.028 --> 10:06.995
Missile contact!

10:07.029 --> 10:08.564
We have a missile contact,

10:08.598 --> 10:09.965
deploy your countermeasures!

10:09.999 --> 10:11.200
Missile contact!

11:11.260 --> 11:13.528
Hey!

11:13.562 --> 11:14.696
Give that back.

11:21.104 --> 11:22.971
Brooks, Brooks, status report.

11:23.005 --> 11:25.041
Status is riddled to fuck, sir.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.642
They keep blinding the
radar, I can't, I can't

11:26.676 --> 11:28.076
get a lock on anything.

11:31.513 --> 11:32.982
We're blind all over the place,

11:33.016 --> 11:34.716
so shoot anything dark
that looks like it's moving.

11:34.750 --> 11:36.618
But our radar's supposed to be on a secure

11:36.652 --> 11:38.687
frequency, how'd they get
a hold of our frequency?

11:38.721 --> 11:41.022
No Brooks, geez.

11:41.056 --> 11:42.391
Let's go for the...

11:42.425 --> 11:43.559
I can't see anything.

11:43.593 --> 11:44.726
Watch your back.

12:03.213 --> 12:04.379
Hang in there, buddy.

12:04.413 --> 12:06.014
Arterial port has been accessed.

12:06.048 --> 12:08.450
This will make you feel better now.

12:08.484 --> 12:10.152
Dalton!

12:10.186 --> 12:11.019
Yeah, Dalton here.

12:11.053 --> 12:12.755
We need to fall back.

12:15.392 --> 12:16.658
All right, everyone back to the ship.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.226
Bring a shitload of class twos.

12:23.499 --> 12:26.535
Private Schorr you're next.

12:26.569 --> 12:28.436
Oh, ow, shit!

12:28.470 --> 12:30.339
Go Schorr, scramble your radar.

12:32.142 --> 12:34.576
Schorr, get your ass up
and back to the transport!

12:47.356 --> 12:50.225
I can't read anything.

12:50.259 --> 12:53.094
How many of them do
you think are out there?

12:53.128 --> 12:54.530
Based on their attack pattern I'd say about

12:54.564 --> 12:57.199
one to three.

12:57.233 --> 12:58.734
You heard Dalton fall back to the ship

12:58.768 --> 13:00.735
and bring as many class
twos as you can carry.

13:05.274 --> 13:07.276
Corporal Kim.

13:07.310 --> 13:10.146
Are you still among us living?

13:10.180 --> 13:12.148
Sadly, yeah.

13:13.816 --> 13:16.185
But, I'm pinned and
they're jamming my video.

13:16.219 --> 13:18.153
Bentley and Paseno, get out of there!

13:18.187 --> 13:19.522
Lang, Kiminski, cover them.

13:20.824 --> 13:24.060
Lang, pick up your ammo!

13:24.094 --> 13:25.661
Your clip, you accidentally ejected it,

13:25.695 --> 13:26.796
pick it up!

13:27.830 --> 13:31.099
That's the army for you,
they give you a weapon,

13:31.133 --> 13:32.234
then they put the ejection clip right

13:32.268 --> 13:34.202
next to the safety switch.

13:34.236 --> 13:36.272
And then, they give you
gloves so you can't feel shit.

13:40.343 --> 13:42.177
Bentley and Paseno, go, go, go!

13:49.786 --> 13:53.022
All right, you two, fall back.

13:53.056 --> 13:55.157
Shit, Lang, they pegged him with a cinder,

13:55.191 --> 13:57.258
so you've got to put him down.

13:57.292 --> 13:59.427
Warning, lethal radiation detected.

14:03.233 --> 14:07.235
My bullets aren't meant for one of 'em.

14:07.269 --> 14:09.271
I don't care, you wanna do the poor bastard

14:09.305 --> 14:10.605
a favor, then you grow a pair

14:10.639 --> 14:12.108
and lay the zap on him right now.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.215
Lang, I swear on the
Outlaw, you raise your weapon

14:19.249 --> 14:20.816
and you pull that trigger.

14:24.686 --> 14:26.287
I am.

14:26.321 --> 14:29.791
I am the force and he is the shield.

14:33.162 --> 14:36.831
Damn it Lang, if I thought
before I pulled every trigger

14:36.865 --> 14:38.466
I'd still be changing diapies.

14:45.274 --> 14:47.009
Hold your fire.

14:48.478 --> 14:50.146
Nice of you to join us Corporal Kim.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.479
Yeah, well they kept on missing me

14:51.513 --> 14:53.215
so here I am.

14:54.484 --> 14:55.718
Everyone through the hatch.

14:55.752 --> 14:57.186
Dalton, cover us.

15:13.202 --> 15:15.271
Hey, Wilson.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.439
Hey, Dalton.

15:17.473 --> 15:18.440
How's it goin'?

15:18.474 --> 15:20.408
I've been better.

15:20.442 --> 15:23.278
Hey listen, you think
you can you do me favor?

15:23.312 --> 15:25.148
Sure, anything.

15:27.683 --> 15:30.019
I'm gonna need you to give
me a little head start.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.690
Yeah, yeah no problem.

15:35.391 --> 15:37.160
Anytime.

15:38.827 --> 15:40.763
Hey Dalton?

15:42.297 --> 15:44.300
You think this was an inside job?

16:12.494 --> 16:14.763
The shot is yours, Private.

16:15.864 --> 16:17.332
No.

16:18.734 --> 16:20.736
Let 'em think we're dead.

16:26.375 --> 16:27.710
Ain't anybody gonna shoot that guy?

16:40.455 --> 16:43.026
An empty sky, no one's listening.

16:44.893 --> 16:47.396
Someone's up there.

16:47.430 --> 16:48.964
Who?

16:48.998 --> 16:51.234
They keep shooting down
all your satellites.

16:52.435 --> 16:54.470
Have a little faith, John.

16:55.937 --> 16:59.274
Faith is for suckers zeroed out on options.

16:59.308 --> 17:00.676
You know you're wasting
power you're gonna need

17:00.710 --> 17:02.411
down the road.

17:02.445 --> 17:06.547
Well, this is a faith based war, John.

17:06.580 --> 17:08.784
If you don't have any then
I believe you're fighting

17:08.818 --> 17:10.419
on the wrong side.

17:11.454 --> 17:14.589
Listen, the only water that
ain't glowing is right here

17:14.623 --> 17:18.393
in these deep craters which
you Banished were smart enough

17:18.426 --> 17:20.662
to build your settlements on.

17:20.695 --> 17:23.332
Faith?

17:23.366 --> 17:27.904
Faith is just an excuse
for a war that pays my rent.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.309
Faith, John.

17:34.711 --> 17:36.246
Okay.

17:37.580 --> 17:39.414
Corporal Kim.

17:39.448 --> 17:40.615
Aloha.

17:40.649 --> 17:42.017
Where the hell are you?

17:42.051 --> 17:44.987
Lake ice cap, I head they
have good bubble salmon.

17:46.121 --> 17:47.389
Christ.

17:47.423 --> 17:48.489
Corporal?

17:48.523 --> 17:50.325
Hey, we're the Banished.

17:50.359 --> 17:51.826
If we can get zipped in
the name of the Outlaw

17:51.860 --> 17:53.696
then we should be able to
use one of the bastard's names

17:53.730 --> 17:54.997
now and again, click.

17:55.031 --> 17:56.832
How we lookin'?

17:56.866 --> 17:59.101
It's a mess,

17:59.135 --> 18:01.702
but lonely.

18:01.736 --> 18:04.906
Whoever tagged us is long
gone, or dancin' outta my range.

18:04.940 --> 18:07.409
How you doing on oxy?

18:07.443 --> 18:08.876
98%.

18:08.910 --> 18:11.447
Oh man, I use more
oxygen when I take a shit.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.481
Private Schorr,

18:13.515 --> 18:14.816
You served under Captain Schwartz.

18:14.850 --> 18:16.719
Deadfield Diggers second company.

18:16.753 --> 18:20.655
Ah well, click this Captain Schwartz

18:20.689 --> 18:22.658
is smeared across the
bloody canyon, you're riding

18:22.692 --> 18:24.392
with The Machine now.

18:24.426 --> 18:27.129
And, when you ride with
The Machine you'll also pray

18:27.163 --> 18:29.998
your tethered soul to The
Machine because it is my job

18:30.032 --> 18:33.602
to keep your sorry tendatz breathing.

18:33.636 --> 18:34.502
Private Lang.

18:34.536 --> 18:35.938
Yes, Sergeant.

18:35.972 --> 18:37.405
See to it that Private Schorr
gets all the help he needs

18:37.439 --> 18:38.373
collecting tanks and tags.

18:38.407 --> 18:40.508
I want to be ghost in 15, click.

18:40.542 --> 18:41.677
Yes, Sergeant.

18:41.711 --> 18:44.680
Babysitting, how come anyone

18:44.714 --> 18:47.082
with half a brain is now dirt meat?

18:52.687 --> 18:55.891
Ah, another one.

18:55.925 --> 18:57.493
They're all over the place.

19:00.730 --> 19:04.031
A lot of oxygen tanks
must have burst on impact.

19:04.065 --> 19:05.401
Huh, really?

19:05.435 --> 19:07.236
Then, what are we gonna breathe?

19:18.447 --> 19:21.150
I'm having a flamin' bad day,
even before we got shot down

19:21.184 --> 19:24.519
some asshole pinched my
breakfast, my shower was cold.

19:24.553 --> 19:26.054
Chem spray's are always cold.

19:26.088 --> 19:28.089
Yeah, well this one was colder than usual.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.992
And, I got a shitty seat on the plane.

19:31.026 --> 19:33.094
You know where you sat
probably saved your life.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.662
Yeah, well it was cramped.

19:34.696 --> 19:36.531
My foot fell asleep and didn't even wake up

19:36.565 --> 19:37.833
until after we crashed.

19:38.900 --> 19:39.835
Whoa.

19:39.869 --> 19:42.671
Warhead online.

19:42.705 --> 19:44.672
Looky here.

19:44.706 --> 19:47.809
My day just got a little more interesting.

19:52.013 --> 19:53.181
Check it out.

19:53.215 --> 19:55.984
I'm an awesome two legged bomb.

20:01.523 --> 20:03.091
Lang?

20:05.561 --> 20:06.828
What happens if we lose?

20:20.609 --> 20:21.677
I don't know.

20:58.179 --> 21:00.114
You're going south?

21:00.148 --> 21:03.117
Yeah, to the rescue point.

21:03.151 --> 21:08.023
Nah, that's over 350 kms
away and we're low on air.

21:10.025 --> 21:12.827
This will cross you closer.

21:12.861 --> 21:15.096
Considering that we're
down over 100 soldiers

21:15.130 --> 21:17.231
and one Jack Rabbit gun ship I'd wager

21:17.265 --> 21:20.469
that Zhukovskiy assault's
going all that smashingly.

21:22.705 --> 21:24.773
We flew through one of the
only barely mapped grids

21:24.807 --> 21:28.111
left on the moon and they shot us down.

21:30.111 --> 21:32.681
That little unguarded water
processing plant in Zhukovskiy

21:32.715 --> 21:34.516
grid and knew we were coming.

21:37.753 --> 21:40.188
Feels more like a lucky shot to me.

21:40.222 --> 21:43.825
A lucky shot is something
that missed you that shouldn't.

21:43.859 --> 21:46.694
A fish big enough to sink our sorry asses,

21:46.728 --> 21:50.198
especially out here,
that took an initiative.

21:55.705 --> 21:59.375
That's an awful lot of
territory to cover, unmapped.

22:00.709 --> 22:02.377
You sure we got enough air?

22:04.379 --> 22:07.116
No one ever got saved
by standing still, John.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.288
Does anyone have any questions?

22:14.657 --> 22:16.691
Hey, I've got a wacky idea.

22:16.725 --> 22:18.693
Why don't we just pay Zhukovskiy a visit?

22:18.727 --> 22:20.328
It's a hell of a lot closer
and don't we have friends

22:20.362 --> 22:21.363
there now?

22:21.397 --> 22:23.332
Zhukovskiy a slash palace.

22:23.366 --> 22:25.232
If the Unlights zipped us
on the way they also knew

22:25.266 --> 22:26.701
we were coming.

22:26.735 --> 22:28.604
This place is not safe.

22:28.638 --> 22:32.207
So, though far, the rescue
point is our best option.

22:34.810 --> 22:36.745
I just post you an extraction clock.

22:36.779 --> 22:38.380
The rescue team will fly
over the extraction point

22:38.414 --> 22:40.315
in exactly 36 hours.

22:40.349 --> 22:43.751
If we're late you become
part of the dirt people.

22:43.785 --> 22:45.653
I just rolled some data.

22:45.687 --> 22:49.624
350 kms will take us 39 hours,
but we only have 28 hours

22:49.658 --> 22:51.692
of oxy left, so what about that?

22:51.726 --> 22:53.528
Tell you what about that?

22:59.267 --> 23:00.902
Are you questioning my judgment?

23:00.936 --> 23:02.637
Warning, oxygen line blocked.

23:02.671 --> 23:04.640
You know and I know that
there are ways to ration

23:04.674 --> 23:07.209
air to stretch that 28 to at least 45.

23:07.243 --> 23:11.379
And, the first rule is, no
extraneous bullshit talking.

23:13.182 --> 23:16.218
At ease your mouth and keep attitudes mild,

23:16.252 --> 23:17.786
because if I don't
think you're pulling gold

23:17.820 --> 23:19.755
I'm gonna pop your valve
and flip your air, click?

23:19.789 --> 23:21.791
Click, click.

23:26.195 --> 23:29.664
We have 350 kms stomp in
the Unlight's backyard.

23:29.698 --> 23:30.731
We have to be smart.

23:30.765 --> 23:33.235
On the dice kitties we might as well

23:33.269 --> 23:35.871
just lie it down and rest
reap like the rest of those

23:35.905 --> 23:37.639
poor bastards.

23:39.942 --> 23:42.211
Does anyone have anything else to add?

23:44.379 --> 23:47.949
All right, keep suit muscles on max.

23:47.983 --> 23:50.419
It'll suck more power
but your walk Earth normal

23:50.453 --> 23:52.688
and save your air.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.790
Lang, Schorr take the extra gas.

23:55.824 --> 23:58.259
Kim, grab the mofo and no bitching.

23:58.293 --> 24:01.962
I'd really like to volunteer
to babysit the mofo, sir.

24:01.996 --> 24:03.398
I think...

24:03.432 --> 24:05.299
Schorr, I wouldn't trust
you with a plunt sucker

24:05.333 --> 24:06.200
on taco night.

24:07.869 --> 24:09.571
Fall out.

24:11.372 --> 24:14.276
Why do we stars have to
do all the schlepping?

24:14.310 --> 24:17.179
When those stars become
bars send me a click.

24:19.982 --> 24:23.884
Fine, give the mofo to
the mofo see if I care.

24:23.918 --> 24:25.588
Doesn't make a difference to me.

24:27.756 --> 24:29.091
Aren't we gonna say something?

24:29.125 --> 24:30.892
To what?

24:30.926 --> 24:33.862
To everyone here, this is their final,

24:33.896 --> 24:35.430
so something should be said.

24:35.464 --> 24:39.101
You heard the Sergeant,
Private, keep moving.

24:39.135 --> 24:42.069
But, the reaped they deserve their rites.

24:42.103 --> 24:43.872
They hear it, I know.

24:43.906 --> 24:46.240
Then, they'll also know we have 28 hours

24:46.274 --> 24:49.177
of tank time left.

24:49.211 --> 24:51.414
They don't want us to join 'em.

24:52.915 --> 24:54.450
They'll understand.

24:56.886 --> 24:59.121
She's right, we should.

24:59.155 --> 25:00.855
Dalton.

25:00.889 --> 25:02.491
Dalton.

25:04.193 --> 25:05.794
We're not the Unlights, John.

25:05.828 --> 25:07.329
And, it's bad luck.

25:09.298 --> 25:11.333
All right, anyone who does
not want to participate

25:11.367 --> 25:12.500
you may follow Dalton.

25:12.534 --> 25:14.835
Kim, you're the closest to the Outlaw

25:14.869 --> 25:17.506
say they're respects.

25:17.540 --> 25:19.173
Sergeant, I'm not exactly
sure that the Outlaw

25:19.207 --> 25:20.941
is all that boned to
hear from me right now.

25:20.975 --> 25:23.511
I don't care, you're Shingastsa Fear monk

25:23.545 --> 25:26.480
which means you spiritually outrank us.

25:26.514 --> 25:29.950
Yeah, but the Outlaw's a
lot harder on guys like me.

25:29.984 --> 25:31.920
Corporal,

25:31.954 --> 25:34.855
you maybe recorded for loyalty assurance.

25:34.889 --> 25:36.324
You wanna piss off the
Outlaw, that's between you

25:36.358 --> 25:37.959
and the Outlaw.

25:37.993 --> 25:40.329
You flake on an assignment,
that's between you and me.

25:45.868 --> 25:47.570
Shit.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.307
All right,

25:56.212 --> 25:56.979
we the Banished...

25:57.013 --> 25:58.814
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

25:58.848 --> 26:00.214
Ain't he gonna say it in Ancient?

26:00.248 --> 26:01.482
If he says it in your
Ancient, you have to say it

26:01.516 --> 26:02.950
in my Ancient.

26:02.984 --> 26:04.553
Yeah, but the Outlaw don't speak standard.

26:04.587 --> 26:06.822
And, how do you know?

26:06.856 --> 26:08.422
The Outlaw probably invented Standard.

26:08.456 --> 26:10.892
Kim, commence eulogizing.

26:17.032 --> 26:20.434
We are The Banished, we
have different affiliations

26:20.468 --> 26:22.071
and different Outlaws

26:23.906 --> 26:25.441
and many languages.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.912
You know the first tenet of
Shingatsa is that everyone

26:30.946 --> 26:32.580
has something to lose.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.051
And the second,

26:37.151 --> 26:39.954
well it teaches us that
unfortunately it's more effective

26:39.988 --> 26:42.424
for that something to be someone.

26:45.060 --> 26:47.429
I used to think everything led somewhere.

26:48.964 --> 26:51.999
Now, I wonder if the Outlaws are mad,

26:52.033 --> 26:55.905
or bored, or have just plain left.

27:01.243 --> 27:03.277
I really don't know, amen.

27:03.311 --> 27:04.379
- Well, that sucked.
- Schorr.

27:04.413 --> 27:05.980
What the fuck does that mean?

27:06.014 --> 27:06.915
Private!

27:06.949 --> 27:08.650
This don't make the reap feel any better.

27:08.684 --> 27:10.117
The supposed to be dead aren't supposed to

27:10.151 --> 27:11.318
feel any better, newbie.

27:11.352 --> 27:13.454
All right, break it up.

27:13.488 --> 27:15.056
They're supposed to feel sorry for us.

27:15.090 --> 27:17.525
Okay, pack it up everyone.

27:17.559 --> 27:20.362
The extraction point's
not getting any closer.

27:20.396 --> 27:23.064
And, no looking back,

27:23.098 --> 27:26.435
the only direction we look is ahead.

27:29.405 --> 27:31.440
Come on, Schorr.

28:24.493 --> 28:26.460
Dear Mister and Missus Brooks,

28:26.494 --> 28:28.028
I regret to inform you
that your daughter Susan

28:28.062 --> 28:31.098
was killed in action today.

28:31.132 --> 28:33.233
♪ Twinkle, Twinkle li ♪

28:33.267 --> 28:35.370
That's a live one.

28:35.404 --> 28:36.337
Damn it.

28:36.371 --> 28:40.408
♪ Twinkle, Twinkle little ♪

28:40.442 --> 28:41.508
Ah, fuck it.

28:41.542 --> 28:43.545
Damn,

28:43.579 --> 28:45.548
how about two outta three?

28:47.081 --> 28:49.683
You sassy little minx, you
really wanna get fresh with me?

28:59.794 --> 29:01.629
Dear Mister and Missus Cipriano,

29:01.663 --> 29:05.767
your son Benjamin was, okay.

29:05.801 --> 29:08.937
Dear Mister and Missus
Cipriano, your son...

29:29.323 --> 29:31.092
Dear Mister and Missus Cipriano

29:31.126 --> 29:35.662
your son Benjamin was.

29:35.696 --> 29:38.066
Regs say that all condolence
files have to be uploaded

29:38.100 --> 29:41.169
on the extraction site,
but I have no idea how

29:41.203 --> 29:42.737
I'm going to get through all these.

29:42.771 --> 29:47.674
Ah, my company has a department

29:47.708 --> 29:51.112
that handles that shit, I
wouldn't know what to say.

29:51.146 --> 29:53.081
You just say what a great
soldier their kid was,

29:53.115 --> 29:55.216
or how their husband or
wife distinguished them self

29:55.250 --> 29:56.217
in an important battle.

29:56.251 --> 29:59.054
I try, but I have no idea
what I'm talking about

29:59.088 --> 30:00.723
half the time.

30:03.425 --> 30:05.759
How's Cassandra and...

30:05.793 --> 30:06.795
Anderson.

30:06.829 --> 30:08.630
Yeah.

30:09.665 --> 30:11.699
Hey, you have a boy?

30:11.733 --> 30:13.569
And two girls.

30:20.309 --> 30:21.375
What?

30:21.409 --> 30:22.277
I'm running out of oxy.

30:22.311 --> 30:24.679
Get in line.

30:24.713 --> 30:28.182
Yeah well, no oxy oxy,
no breathee breathee.

30:28.216 --> 30:30.151
How are they doing?

30:30.185 --> 30:32.453
They're starving.

30:32.487 --> 30:35.090
Supply lines got cut
off when Venter's fell.

30:36.425 --> 30:38.192
Why the hell do we have
to walk when we could cover

30:38.226 --> 30:39.626
more ground by bouncing?

30:39.660 --> 30:41.595
Take it up with the Sergeant.

30:41.629 --> 30:43.297
I take anything up with
the Sergeant I'm gonna get

30:43.331 --> 30:44.531
my ass brain railed.

30:44.565 --> 30:46.233
Then take it up with the other sergeant.

30:46.267 --> 30:48.502
I don't trust the other sergeant.

30:48.536 --> 30:50.872
He walked from the Reap
rites, what is he some Unlight

30:50.906 --> 30:51.806
or something?

30:51.840 --> 30:53.173
I'm sorry to hear that, John.

30:53.207 --> 30:55.643
Is there anything you can do?

30:55.677 --> 30:58.145
Well, Cassandra is Luthor
Bask and they can't accept help

30:58.179 --> 31:00.347
from anyone who isn't Luthor Bask,

31:00.381 --> 31:03.117
so I had to get a little creative.

31:03.151 --> 31:06.187
Look at his suit, he's no
Unlight, he's a mercenary.

31:06.221 --> 31:08.355
Yeah, well he ain't affiliated,
and I don't trust nobody

31:08.389 --> 31:10.391
who ain't affiliated.

31:10.425 --> 31:12.727
Plus, he walked from that
zoomer boom without a scratch.

31:12.761 --> 31:13.827
So did we.

31:13.861 --> 31:17.598
You know, Dalton, I never
took you, a Death Merchant

31:17.632 --> 31:20.134
of Tyco, as one to fall for a native.

31:20.168 --> 31:23.238
No? Well, I must be gettin' old.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.507
Yeah, well we were all
sittin' together in the same

31:25.541 --> 31:27.208
part of the ship.

31:27.242 --> 31:28.776
That part of the ship that broke together,

31:28.810 --> 31:30.511
but stayed together after the crash.

31:30.545 --> 31:33.314
And he, well he came from a
different part of the ship.

31:33.348 --> 31:35.717
So, you're saying one of
the Death Merchant's of Tyco

31:35.751 --> 31:37.317
is an Unlight spy?

31:37.351 --> 31:41.456
No, I'm saying you're either
affiliated or you're not

31:41.490 --> 31:42.690
affiliated.

31:42.724 --> 31:44.558
And, I don't trust nobody that's not.

31:44.592 --> 31:47.862
Well, what do we got here?

31:55.736 --> 31:58.338
See, I don't give a
rat's collar who the fuck

31:58.372 --> 32:00.807
you trust, Private.

32:00.841 --> 32:04.179
Dalton's been fighting
since before the invasion.

32:04.213 --> 32:07.347
Curious, how long have
you been on the dirt?

32:07.381 --> 32:08.850
Two weeks, sir.

32:08.884 --> 32:11.451
Two week, huh?

32:11.485 --> 32:15.190
That man has been pegging
Unlights for five fucking years.

32:15.224 --> 32:16.356
Five years!

32:16.390 --> 32:18.960
Most rooks won't last three weeks out here.

32:20.995 --> 32:24.199
Schorr, since you're dying to bash skulls

32:24.233 --> 32:28.303
you can do it against the tube
breathers that got us here.

32:28.337 --> 32:29.171
Take point.

32:29.205 --> 32:32.806
Really, I never took point before, sir.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.542
And, I never survived a plane crash before,

32:34.576 --> 32:36.277
but look how well we're doing.

32:36.311 --> 32:37.979
Take your position Private.

32:38.013 --> 32:40.249
Awesome, I mean yes, sir.

32:42.283 --> 32:43.785
Sarge.

32:47.255 --> 32:50.758
Lang, fall behind him, keep your mouth shut

32:50.792 --> 32:51.692
and your mic off.

32:51.726 --> 32:52.660
Do you understand?

32:52.694 --> 32:54.897
Yes, Sergeant, sorry.

32:59.935 --> 33:02.336
I hope I didn't embarrass you, John.

33:02.370 --> 33:04.271
I know I could switch to
the Unlights at any time

33:04.305 --> 33:05.373
if the price was right.

33:05.407 --> 33:06.873
I'm used to my share of 'em.

33:06.907 --> 33:08.476
Yeah.

33:09.645 --> 33:12.313
Did you zero Schorr's flame tats?

33:12.347 --> 33:14.816
It means he's part of a
Numerical Ballisbun gang,

33:14.850 --> 33:17.418
eastern diocese probably.

33:17.452 --> 33:19.821
You know what happened to those people.

33:19.855 --> 33:21.390
Yes, I do.

33:22.623 --> 33:25.159
Your army of the Outlaws
is falling apart, isn't it?

33:26.461 --> 33:29.463
I mean it didn't work downside,
why would it work here?

33:33.068 --> 33:35.902
Desperation.

33:35.936 --> 33:38.439
Yeah?

33:38.473 --> 33:40.607
The Unlight tribes are splintering as well.

33:40.641 --> 33:43.811
They're harvesting each other for water.

33:47.349 --> 33:49.251
They're falling apart, too.

33:50.584 --> 33:54.889
Yeah, the moon is the
end of the road for us,

33:54.923 --> 33:58.460
for all of us if things don't change here.

34:22.750 --> 34:25.853
Boo.

34:27.822 --> 34:29.424
Keep moving people, those tracks

34:29.458 --> 34:32.726
could be five minutes old or five years.

34:32.761 --> 34:35.797
Schorr, back to point
and drink some breakfast.

34:35.831 --> 34:38.333
I don't want you apes dehydrated.

34:39.534 --> 34:40.967
Oh, don't carry it the way they showed you

34:41.002 --> 34:42.904
in basic, it'll throw off
your center of gravity,

34:42.938 --> 34:44.572
you'll use more air.

34:48.076 --> 34:49.878
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

35:09.797 --> 35:11.465
It's like herding cattle.

35:18.440 --> 35:22.477
Kim, how are we doing on that bandwidth?

35:22.511 --> 35:25.046
Looks like fishing at
midnight without a flashlight.

35:25.080 --> 35:27.449
We're pretty far south, and dark.

35:31.052 --> 35:33.154
All right, let Kim piggy back off your

35:33.188 --> 35:35.257
bandwidth to boost reception.

35:37.458 --> 35:40.395
Suit transmitters connected.

35:44.031 --> 35:45.533
I got one.

35:45.567 --> 35:46.868
Is it friendly, or unfriendly?

35:46.902 --> 35:48.535
Crap, unfriendly.

35:48.569 --> 35:49.971
It's Liberation Leslie.

35:50.005 --> 35:51.406
Surrender and

35:51.440 --> 35:54.009
the omni band for all sides to hear.

35:57.578 --> 36:01.681
Hey. Why did everybody the fuck stop?

36:01.715 --> 36:03.683
Earlier today sent

36:03.717 --> 36:04.919
an assault force to take our water...

36:04.953 --> 36:07.120
Hey, the assault happened.

36:07.154 --> 36:08.723
We shot down your gun ships

36:08.757 --> 36:09.924
as they flew overhead.

36:09.958 --> 36:11.591
We slaughtered your brothers and sisters

36:11.625 --> 36:13.960
in the wreckage until
there were no survivors.

36:13.994 --> 36:16.063
Hello?

36:17.132 --> 36:19.500
At 12:25:18 we launched a strike

36:19.534 --> 36:21.768
against two of your older
settlements on the southwest

36:21.802 --> 36:23.672
far side.

36:26.208 --> 36:28.676
They struck the domed
cities of Devries and Orlav

36:28.710 --> 36:31.078
three minutes later.

36:31.112 --> 36:34.614
Both domes suffered a
complete decompression.

36:34.648 --> 36:36.750
A legion of execution
troops were then dispatched

36:36.784 --> 36:39.453
to engage any refugees.

36:40.554 --> 36:43.591
As remaining civilian dead were incinerated

36:43.625 --> 36:46.627
we had Luthor of Bask
detainees say their final rites

36:46.661 --> 36:47.428
before...

36:47.462 --> 36:48.162
- Kim!
- Hold on.

36:48.196 --> 36:49.497
Neutralized.

36:49.531 --> 36:50.765
Kim!

36:50.799 --> 36:52.033
And they never ask for help

36:52.067 --> 36:53.734
in your army.

36:53.768 --> 36:55.203
I think we've had enough.

36:55.237 --> 36:58.004
Corporals, privates, kill your Sergeant

36:58.038 --> 36:59.941
because...

37:01.842 --> 37:03.946
All right, everyone fall in.

37:04.980 --> 37:08.748
This is internal online
propaganda and you know it.

37:08.782 --> 37:09.984
Come on.

37:10.018 --> 37:12.587
I've got something.

37:12.621 --> 37:13.821
You're probably just chasing radar ghosts,

37:13.855 --> 37:15.022
Schorr, stay put.

37:15.056 --> 37:16.189
No, Sergeant, I'm getting something.

37:16.223 --> 37:17.290
Damn it, Schorr, I said stay put.

37:17.324 --> 37:19.893
No, I got eyes on it Sarge, just stay back.

37:19.927 --> 37:21.094
Wait, I can take care of this.

37:21.128 --> 37:22.096
Schorr!

37:22.130 --> 37:23.564
I got this.

37:30.572 --> 37:32.239
I got this.

37:40.315 --> 37:41.281
God damn it.

37:46.554 --> 37:48.689
Fuck.

37:48.723 --> 37:50.658
What the hell happened?

37:50.692 --> 37:52.058
I don't know, snipe bot or something.

37:52.092 --> 37:53.194
That's no snipe bot.

37:53.228 --> 37:54.594
We gotta get 'em outta there.

37:54.628 --> 37:56.631
No, hold on, we don't know how many other

37:56.665 --> 37:57.665
of them are out there.

37:57.699 --> 37:58.598
It doesn't matter.

37:58.632 --> 37:59.866
Yes, it does.

37:59.900 --> 38:02.203
They might not know how
many of us are in here.

38:04.706 --> 38:06.073
Come on, Schorr, turn over.

38:06.107 --> 38:08.174
Interior wound temporarily sealed.

38:08.208 --> 38:09.576
But, the guys is wounded.

38:09.610 --> 38:11.546
No, Corporal, the guy's already dead.

38:12.681 --> 38:13.848
Come on, Schorr, turn the fuck over.

38:13.882 --> 38:14.781
I need to see.

38:14.815 --> 38:16.116
We gotta do something.

38:16.150 --> 38:17.551
Hold on.

38:17.585 --> 38:19.819
Warning, left lung is collapsing.

38:19.853 --> 38:22.189
Enough.

38:23.257 --> 38:25.192
Command function override,
open skull vents full.

38:25.226 --> 38:27.561
Go Ken, go Ken.

38:30.197 --> 38:32.633
Nav suit system overridden,

38:32.667 --> 38:35.469
external helmet vents opened.

39:08.902 --> 39:10.772
So, what do we do now?

39:13.407 --> 39:15.110
Fuck.

39:18.779 --> 39:21.082
We keep moving to the rescue point.

39:22.250 --> 39:24.752
And, who's got the damn cards?

39:56.717 --> 39:58.151
Radiation profile match,

39:58.185 --> 40:00.588
Unlight Infantry Engine Pack.

41:38.386 --> 41:40.020
Come on.

41:47.094 --> 41:49.964
18 minutes till extraction.

41:49.998 --> 41:53.200
Lang, we all have the same clock.

41:53.234 --> 41:55.369
We can all see the same thing.

41:57.105 --> 41:58.939
Sorry.

41:58.973 --> 42:00.508
The rescue zoomer won't get here any sooner

42:00.542 --> 42:02.610
by you keeping count.

42:05.547 --> 42:07.315
I call.

42:08.549 --> 42:10.917
Really?

42:10.951 --> 42:14.154
Do you think they'll pull
us back from the front?

42:14.188 --> 42:16.357
You know, to protect the cities.

42:18.025 --> 42:20.261
We'll go where we're needed.

42:22.496 --> 42:24.799
Ah.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.399
Didn't you take a vow of charity?

42:26.433 --> 42:30.504
Yeah, what's one more thing
that I get to repent for.

42:31.839 --> 42:35.042
Okay, who's in next hand.

42:38.145 --> 42:39.879
This changes the war, doesn't it?

42:39.913 --> 42:41.381
I mean now that they're
attacking our cities.

42:41.415 --> 42:43.417
Hey, we started it right?

42:43.451 --> 42:44.951
Zhukovskiy was a city.

42:44.985 --> 42:46.219
It was an ice mine.

42:46.253 --> 42:47.488
It had settlements around it.

42:47.522 --> 42:49.055
How do you know they weren't military?

42:49.089 --> 42:52.026
I don't, all I know is
that we all keep fighting

42:52.060 --> 42:53.861
over the same thing:

42:53.895 --> 42:56.498
Holes in the ground with
inches of water in 'em.

42:57.965 --> 42:59.866
This war is getting meaner.

42:59.900 --> 43:01.301
We're getting near an extraction point

43:01.335 --> 43:03.504
so I'm gonna bring the
search and rescue mode online.

43:03.538 --> 43:05.205
I'm getting nothing on
the radio but static.

43:05.239 --> 43:06.873
It's gonna be hard to spot anybody.

43:06.907 --> 43:09.475
Radio silence only and ID by visual.

43:09.509 --> 43:12.413
Throttle back the burners
and fly low and slow.

43:12.447 --> 43:15.883
Which means we should pull
back to protect the cities.

43:15.917 --> 43:19.053
Private, don't waste your
air worrying about what may

43:19.087 --> 43:21.555
or may not happen.

43:21.589 --> 43:24.024
If a few missiles could
get to Orlav and Devries

43:24.058 --> 43:26.960
then maybe some could
get to Collins or Shepard.

43:26.994 --> 43:28.895
When you worship the decimal
point like the Unlights

43:28.929 --> 43:30.897
- you wind up with two things...
- Okay, shut up, Kim.

43:30.931 --> 43:33.933
Stock market and warheads
with really terrific accuracy.

43:33.967 --> 43:37.303
Yeah, yeah, so that's what we should do.

43:37.337 --> 43:40.140
We should pull back and protect the cities.

43:40.174 --> 43:42.377
Are you gonna bet?

43:44.212 --> 43:47.480
Can't wait for this stupid war to be over.

43:47.514 --> 43:49.250
Number two engine is starting to give out

43:49.284 --> 43:50.951
and we're yaring a little wide.

43:50.985 --> 43:53.587
Shut it down and burn one and four hotter.

43:53.621 --> 43:55.656
Bus A is out.

43:55.690 --> 43:58.591
I mean if their guidance is
so good the Unlights could

43:58.625 --> 44:00.928
slingshot in a bunch of
troops from Earthside,

44:00.962 --> 44:02.930
seal the bubbles, and occupy the cities.

44:02.964 --> 44:03.897
Like Mare Crisium.

44:03.931 --> 44:05.566
Exactly like Mare Crisium.

44:05.600 --> 44:08.067
No, not like Mare Crisium.

44:08.101 --> 44:11.038
In Mare Crisium they
tunneled under the perimeter,

44:11.072 --> 44:13.207
but now we have better
ears and crawler mines

44:13.241 --> 44:15.942
so we can see 'em coming.

44:15.976 --> 44:17.912
Gunner crews keep your eyes on the sky.

44:17.946 --> 44:20.080
Do not fire until you get a visual.

44:20.114 --> 44:23.451
Click that, powered up,
waiting on visual confirm.

44:27.621 --> 44:30.056
Wait, you're not gonna bet that, are you?

44:30.090 --> 44:31.424
Yeah, it's tomato, I hate tomato.

44:31.458 --> 44:34.561
No, no, no don't listen
to her you wanna bet that.

44:37.397 --> 44:39.033
Thank you very much.

44:39.067 --> 44:41.701
There you go, in better hands
that tomato could have been

44:41.735 --> 44:43.037
chicken soup.

44:43.071 --> 44:44.203
Why are you telling her that?

44:44.237 --> 44:46.006
It's all right, I don't like chicken soup.

44:46.040 --> 44:48.877
Well, dear it's good for you.

44:50.078 --> 44:53.047
Kim, give the private back her tomato.

44:53.081 --> 44:54.480
Hold on a second, I won this.

44:54.514 --> 44:58.718
Good, then I'm giving you
one less thing to repent for.

44:58.752 --> 45:00.455
That's an order.

45:07.728 --> 45:09.562
And, I was gonna make Beef Stroganoff.

45:09.596 --> 45:13.232
All right, give me an
IV tube from the med kit.

45:13.266 --> 45:17.037
Time to begin maneuver is 03:05:03.

45:17.071 --> 45:18.571
Yeah, that's gonna be tricky.

45:18.605 --> 45:19.739
Keep an eye on the radar.

45:19.773 --> 45:22.375
Rendezvous site has to be close.

45:22.409 --> 45:25.312
You know right after I was
ordained, I was called in

45:25.346 --> 45:27.680
on the kill squad at Crisium.

45:27.714 --> 45:29.149
Good for you.

45:29.183 --> 45:31.484
It took days to flush those bastards out.

45:31.518 --> 45:32.486
18.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.053
Pay attention, Lang.

45:34.087 --> 45:36.256
The trick is to poke
it right in the center,

45:36.290 --> 45:38.058
which is the closest
to your heating element.

45:38.092 --> 45:42.497
That will warm everything
up and infuse the flavors.

45:43.797 --> 45:46.600
They occupied the city for 18 days.

45:46.634 --> 45:49.002
18, huh, felt shorter.

45:49.036 --> 45:52.105
Okay, then you add a bit of the tomato,

45:52.139 --> 45:54.540
which let's face it, is mostly salt,

45:54.574 --> 45:57.777
and add a dash of milk for consistency.

45:57.811 --> 46:00.247
No, they were there 18 days.

46:00.281 --> 46:02.484
Pay attention.

46:04.552 --> 46:07.187
Voila, chicken soup.

46:07.221 --> 46:09.090
Go ahead, give it a taste.

46:14.462 --> 46:16.096
Search and rescue grid online

46:16.130 --> 46:18.732
and scanning for transponders.

46:18.766 --> 46:20.502
Delish, right?

46:22.804 --> 46:26.272
Oh, it's vile.

46:26.306 --> 46:28.107
See, I told you we should have taught her

46:28.141 --> 46:29.877
how to make Stroganoff.

46:33.214 --> 46:35.549
So, on the last day in
Crisium we find this squad

46:35.583 --> 46:38.052
of Unlights roached out in a school, right.

46:39.286 --> 46:42.189
We have this place completely surrounded

46:43.223 --> 46:46.693
and they just sat there playing cards.

46:49.197 --> 46:51.032
So, finally we nerve the place.

46:52.232 --> 46:55.234
They weren't playing cards.

46:55.268 --> 46:57.171
They were burning out the
tongues of the children

46:57.205 --> 46:59.706
so they couldn't hear themselves pray.

47:22.630 --> 47:26.667
Well, those kids'll make great soldiers.

47:29.170 --> 47:32.639
Why, because they won't
be able to talk back?

47:33.875 --> 47:35.776
No.

47:37.612 --> 47:39.781
You wanna see someone really fight,

47:42.282 --> 47:44.018
wound them first.

48:03.203 --> 48:04.205
Where the hell is Dalton?

48:04.239 --> 48:06.772
We all make our choices, Corporal.

48:06.806 --> 48:07.875
We are under attack,

48:07.909 --> 48:09.308
repeat we are under attack.

48:09.342 --> 48:10.343
Gun crews to your stations.

48:10.377 --> 48:12.479
Med teams secure your patients.

48:12.513 --> 48:14.547
Well, if he wanted to
off himself he shoulda

48:14.581 --> 48:17.518
donated us his air.

48:17.552 --> 48:19.553
I have multiple bogies, repeat I have

48:19.587 --> 48:21.187
multiple bogies.

48:21.221 --> 48:22.788
We're taking fire, weapon ejector manifold

48:22.822 --> 48:24.790
is hit and it looks like we
have a right panel hull breach.

48:24.824 --> 48:26.326
I can't get a lock.

48:26.360 --> 48:27.460
Fire at will.

48:27.494 --> 48:29.863
We're gonna have to bail
into AGS on the throttle down.

48:33.868 --> 48:36.270
I've got red lights on.

48:42.743 --> 48:45.212
Not good, I'm reading multiple failures.

48:45.246 --> 48:47.648
Avionics is beginning to cut out.

48:49.350 --> 48:51.218
High angles are shot,
I'm switching to manual.

48:51.252 --> 48:53.819
Tower, this is 1-4-4 we're
carrying wounded and are

48:53.853 --> 48:55.555
coming in hot and on a low approach.

48:55.589 --> 48:57.924
144 this is tower, we have you on board.

48:57.958 --> 48:59.792
Fire and med crews are standing by.

48:59.826 --> 49:03.529
Click that tower, we're pretty banged up.

49:09.469 --> 49:11.705
We're losing altitude fast.

49:11.739 --> 49:12.738
I just lost number 4.

49:12.772 --> 49:15.308
Pull up, pull up!

49:27.621 --> 49:29.723
They're not showing up, are they?

49:31.491 --> 49:33.259
That's what I get for
actually looking forward

49:33.293 --> 49:35.395
to something.

49:35.429 --> 49:38.297
All right, get up.

49:38.331 --> 49:39.766
Where are we going?

49:40.967 --> 49:43.803
Away, come on.

49:43.837 --> 49:45.538
Maybe they're late.

49:45.572 --> 49:47.274
They're not late Private,
they were shot down

49:47.308 --> 49:49.276
just as we were.

49:49.310 --> 49:51.410
Well, maybe command will
send out a rescue zoomer

49:51.444 --> 49:52.546
to look for them and then catch us.

49:52.580 --> 49:56.383
I wish that were the case,
Corporal, but Father Command

49:56.417 --> 49:58.919
is not going to send out
another ship at this point.

49:58.953 --> 50:01.455
Where are we gonna go?

50:01.489 --> 50:03.256
South.

50:03.290 --> 50:05.359
South?

50:05.393 --> 50:06.326
You know what's south?

50:06.360 --> 50:07.928
A lot more of nothing.

50:09.462 --> 50:13.634
Well, what you don't know
is that every 500 kms or so.

50:13.668 --> 50:18.404
Father Command has buried
a cache of air and water.

50:18.438 --> 50:19.772
There'll also be a comm rocket to fire off

50:19.806 --> 50:21.741
to let them know where we are.

50:21.775 --> 50:23.410
And, what makes you think
the Unlights won't shoot

50:23.444 --> 50:26.647
that down the way they do
everything else we fire up?

50:26.681 --> 50:29.817
Proximity alert, movement detected.

50:42.362 --> 50:44.665
How full is that?

50:44.699 --> 50:47.433
Oxygen nitrogen mix with trace radiation.

50:47.467 --> 50:48.701
It's about three quarters.

50:48.735 --> 50:50.937
That's around 18 hours each.

50:50.971 --> 50:52.439
24,

50:52.473 --> 50:54.408
I don't want any.

50:54.442 --> 50:56.343
Dalton, I don't care what you want,

50:56.377 --> 50:57.843
that's faithful gold in there.

50:57.877 --> 50:59.011
I'm not breathing their air.

50:59.045 --> 51:01.415
But, it's their water on
Earth that's radioactive.

51:01.449 --> 51:02.982
Hey, it's a free satellite
Dalton can make up

51:03.016 --> 51:04.886
his own mind, Sergeant.

51:06.853 --> 51:08.388
Kim, you and Lang fill up the tanks,

51:08.422 --> 51:10.824
but only 18 hours worth.

51:12.793 --> 51:14.460
Mister Dalton and I are going for a little

51:14.494 --> 51:16.429
administrative stroll.

51:41.087 --> 51:44.225
Command function override
slave to Dalton's vitals.

51:45.592 --> 51:48.828
Suits linked, oxygen at 7%.

51:48.862 --> 51:50.564
You want to tell me why
you used up the equivalent

51:50.598 --> 51:53.667
of three hours of good
walk time on a lone Unlight

51:53.701 --> 51:55.602
getting his camping badge?

51:55.636 --> 51:58.504
Well, I figured she's the one nailed us,

51:58.538 --> 52:00.640
so I popper before she
zeroed our position wide.

52:00.674 --> 52:02.808
They know our position, John.

52:02.842 --> 52:05.479
If they gave a shit
we'd be greased already.

52:05.513 --> 52:08.547
I don't have the bandwidth for revenge.

52:08.581 --> 52:10.450
It uses too much air.

52:10.484 --> 52:13.253
Well, you see that's
where you and I differ.

52:15.089 --> 52:17.156
It doesn't matter.

52:17.190 --> 52:18.457
We're all dead anyway.

52:18.491 --> 52:19.625
Don't walk away from me.

52:26.467 --> 52:29.803
What I see is we're up two tanks of air

52:29.837 --> 52:33.439
and down a set of lungs so
roll the fucking numbers, John.

52:33.473 --> 52:35.741
We're very much not dead.

52:35.775 --> 52:38.044
Well, then maybe planned this status,

52:38.078 --> 52:40.580
because I don't recall
ever hearing anything

52:40.614 --> 52:43.783
about a cache of buried supplies

52:43.817 --> 52:46.051
or secret stash of anything anywhere

52:46.085 --> 52:49.623
between here and the
next Unlight command pod.

52:51.525 --> 52:55.127
So, come tomorrow what
are they gonna breathe?

52:55.161 --> 52:58.431
I don't know, but we have to keep moving

52:58.465 --> 53:00.066
while we figure it out.

53:00.100 --> 53:04.638
Geez, Mo like at where you're askin' them

53:04.672 --> 53:05.738
to follow ya:

53:05.772 --> 53:08.508
To the end of the fucking world.

53:08.542 --> 53:10.411
It's a bullshit gamble.

53:11.911 --> 53:17.216
Yes, but people will
do what they feel, John,

53:17.250 --> 53:19.453
instead of what they know,

53:19.487 --> 53:21.488
even if it is a bullshit gamble.

53:21.522 --> 53:23.756
And, when they realize that's what it is

53:23.790 --> 53:25.058
what are you gonna do?

53:27.994 --> 53:30.830
You find different bullshit.

53:55.522 --> 53:56.522
It smells different.

53:56.556 --> 53:57.656
What's that?

53:57.690 --> 54:00.526
Their air, it smells different.

54:00.560 --> 54:04.598
Smells like the real
thing, made in real sky.

54:04.632 --> 54:06.265
I don't like it.

54:06.299 --> 54:09.502
Hey, Earthside that's
pretty much the only thing

54:09.536 --> 54:11.237
they'll be able to fight about.

54:14.007 --> 54:15.475
Hey,

54:16.610 --> 54:19.613
you groin plug with a Fear Monk?

54:29.790 --> 54:33.292
I thought Fear Monk's aren't allowed to

54:33.326 --> 54:34.361
you know.

54:34.395 --> 54:36.562
Well, technically we're
also not supposed to kill

54:36.596 --> 54:40.966
or maim or destroy, but hey
if they're willing to enforce

54:41.000 --> 54:44.471
war time exceptions, so am I.

54:46.607 --> 54:49.676
But, I thought carnal
musings are forbidden.

54:55.583 --> 54:58.551
The tighter the belief,
the easier it snaps.

54:58.585 --> 55:00.886
That why I just look at is
as more of a personal addendum

55:00.920 --> 55:03.689
to the over-arching rule.

55:03.723 --> 55:07.660
Well, you know, at least up here.

55:14.768 --> 55:18.270
I thought you guys just
fight the war downside,

55:18.304 --> 55:21.908
rescuing babies and
diverting trains and stuff.

55:21.942 --> 55:23.743
Well, seeing that the
Unlight soldiers are drafted

55:23.777 --> 55:26.613
in vitro, I'd say the joke is on us.

55:26.647 --> 55:29.683
Still, some of us Fear
Monks wind up pulling

55:29.717 --> 55:31.618
the short straw and get
bumped to do the more fun stuff

55:31.652 --> 55:32.819
up here with you guys.

55:32.853 --> 55:36.756
Hmm, lucky you, how'd you manage that?

55:43.197 --> 55:44.763
I was the asshole who
asked too many questions

55:44.797 --> 55:47.067
during meditation and bingo night.

55:47.101 --> 55:51.772
So, they banished me
here with The Banished.

56:10.056 --> 56:11.857
My dad used to say this land'll kill you

56:11.891 --> 56:13.627
just for being here.

56:14.728 --> 56:17.696
I don't know, maybe they
wanted to shut you up.

56:17.730 --> 56:20.467
Nah, they're not that smart.

56:21.701 --> 56:22.768
See, the Fear Monks they worship the moon

56:22.802 --> 56:25.404
as the mover of oceans and
the cocktail shaker of life,

56:25.438 --> 56:28.109
so my guess,

56:30.411 --> 56:33.946
it's to teach me a lesson
or some shit like that.

56:37.784 --> 56:39.453
Have you learned anything?

56:47.360 --> 56:49.330
Do you know what water's like?

56:50.831 --> 56:53.165
Yeah.

56:53.199 --> 56:55.301
It's like running out of this stuff.

57:17.123 --> 57:19.726
There's 18 hours left in the tank.

57:21.795 --> 57:26.433
Please, don't help the
Unlights with a body count.

57:28.101 --> 57:29.603
Okay.

57:35.174 --> 57:37.243
We move out in ten.

58:00.500 --> 58:02.468
Are we there yet?

58:04.471 --> 58:07.806
I'm serious, how far are
we from the supply cache?

58:07.840 --> 58:10.109
Not that far, keep walking.

58:15.449 --> 58:17.783
Not that I'm keeping track,
but we're over 500 ks along

58:17.817 --> 58:20.886
on this little dirt safari of
yours and I'm starting to get

58:20.920 --> 58:21.821
a pinky toe cramp.

58:27.393 --> 58:30.529
You know how Father Command is,

58:30.563 --> 58:32.031
they never do anything exact.

58:33.500 --> 58:35.334
Don't you remember last
year when we were...

58:41.141 --> 58:42.341
Warning, pressure gel sealing.

58:48.982 --> 58:49.982
Crawler mines.

58:55.054 --> 58:58.091
Move, move.

59:01.161 --> 59:02.162
Corporal,

59:04.197 --> 59:05.098
stand back.

59:45.239 --> 59:47.040
Dalton.

59:53.246 --> 59:54.413
The Machine said no jumping.

59:54.447 --> 59:56.850
The Machine's dead.

59:56.884 --> 59:57.951
All right, on the count of three

59:59.418 --> 01:00:00.919
I'm gonna seal your suit.

01:00:00.953 --> 01:00:03.922
One.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:11.598
- Can you stand?
- What do you think?

01:00:11.632 --> 01:00:13.334
Shit.

01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:16.134
What are you gonna do?

01:00:16.168 --> 01:00:18.805
We're gonna jump.

01:00:18.839 --> 01:00:21.406
What am I gonna do if you step on a mine?

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.609
Head north east.

01:00:22.643 --> 01:00:24.143
That's north east.

01:00:24.177 --> 01:00:25.277
Good point.

01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:26.279
That way.

01:00:42.362 --> 01:00:47.066
Proximity alert, warning, proximity alert.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.002
Proximity warning

01:00:49.036 --> 01:00:50.502
ximity alert, warning

01:00:50.536 --> 01:00:53.305
proximity warning, warning

01:00:53.339 --> 01:00:56.676
proximity warning.

01:01:56.335 --> 01:01:58.705
I want you to walk into the blade

01:01:58.739 --> 01:02:00.073
like a big girl

01:02:00.107 --> 01:02:02.508
with your eyes open

01:02:02.542 --> 01:02:05.111
just like Mommy would.

01:02:05.145 --> 01:02:07.113
What side are we on?

01:02:07.147 --> 01:02:10.082
Like we had a choice
between living and dying.

01:02:21.395 --> 01:02:23.261
Warning, pressure gel failing.

01:02:35.107 --> 01:02:37.176
Your seal's been compromised.

01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:38.710
Corporal, look at me, look at me.

01:02:38.744 --> 01:02:40.446
Look at me Corporal, don't look at the leg,

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.446
look at me.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.647
Look at me.

01:02:42.681 --> 01:02:44.183
You're gonna be okay.

01:02:44.217 --> 01:02:46.185
How is this okay?

01:02:46.219 --> 01:02:48.621
Your seal's been compromised.

01:02:50.623 --> 01:02:52.058
Okay.

01:02:53.692 --> 01:02:56.662
Remove the armor, breath in.

01:02:56.696 --> 01:02:58.130
One.

01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:03.569
Okay, listen to me.

01:03:03.603 --> 01:03:06.205
Listen to me, you're gonna be fine.

01:03:06.239 --> 01:03:07.205
You'll be all right.

01:03:07.239 --> 01:03:08.540
Your leg ain't fucking oatmeal.

01:03:08.574 --> 01:03:10.109
Shh.

01:03:10.143 --> 01:03:14.513
Listen to me, okay, you'll be fine.

01:03:14.547 --> 01:03:15.680
- Pressure gel.
- In a few seconds,

01:03:15.714 --> 01:03:16.748
with dermo anesthetic

01:03:16.782 --> 01:03:18.817
- applied and stabilized.
- You're gonna be the luckiest

01:03:18.851 --> 01:03:22.221
guy on this rock.

01:03:27.159 --> 01:03:29.261
Private, how you doin?

01:03:29.295 --> 01:03:32.198
I am the sword he is the
shield, I am the mechanism

01:03:32.232 --> 01:03:33.533
of the Outlaw's will.

01:03:33.567 --> 01:03:35.768
I will not falter.

01:03:35.802 --> 01:03:36.701
Private?

01:03:36.735 --> 01:03:39.071
I'm alive, I'll be all right.

01:03:39.105 --> 01:03:42.408
All right, all right, okay.

01:03:42.442 --> 01:03:45.310
All right, I'm gonna
open up your skull valve

01:03:45.344 --> 01:03:47.547
one quarter of an inch

01:03:47.581 --> 01:03:50.183
decompress your ears, don't blow an ear.

01:03:52.518 --> 01:03:55.721
Decompress your eardrums.

01:03:58.458 --> 01:04:01.359
There you go, you feel better?

01:04:01.393 --> 01:04:02.261
No.

01:04:02.295 --> 01:04:04.797
Me neither.

01:04:04.831 --> 01:04:09.134
All right, well just want you to lay back

01:04:09.168 --> 01:04:10.303
and drink your lunch.

01:04:10.337 --> 01:04:13.473
Come on, I don't want you dehydrated.

01:04:13.507 --> 01:04:15.808
Holy shit.

01:04:15.842 --> 01:04:18.276
Okay, all right,

01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:21.214
all right.

01:04:21.248 --> 01:04:23.181
That's it.

01:04:23.215 --> 01:04:26.852
Oh, is that the chicken soup?

01:04:26.886 --> 01:04:28.654
Oh, you shoulda told me I woulda traded it

01:04:28.688 --> 01:04:29.821
for my Beef Stroganoff.

01:04:31.257 --> 01:04:32.424
That's all right, here take it.

01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:35.261
Nah, that's okay, that's all right.

01:04:35.295 --> 01:04:38.665
I'll win it off Kim later in poker.

01:04:40.266 --> 01:04:43.770
You downsiders like your land animals.

01:04:46.206 --> 01:04:48.140
Land,

01:04:48.174 --> 01:04:50.243
important that stuff.

01:04:50.277 --> 01:04:54.715
Yeah, livestock takes up
too much oxy and water.

01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:59.252
Yeah, it's okay, more beef,
and chicken, and gluten

01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:00.988
for the rest of us.

01:05:02.455 --> 01:05:04.689
I love watching you all
fight for meat scraps

01:05:04.723 --> 01:05:06.859
in the mess hall.

01:05:06.893 --> 01:05:08.728
It's so funny.

01:05:11.364 --> 01:05:13.066
Yeah.

01:05:15.668 --> 01:05:18.837
Yeah, even a tiny piece of bacon corner

01:05:18.871 --> 01:05:21.540
can be like a little, little piece

01:05:21.574 --> 01:05:23.944
of home.

01:05:25.545 --> 01:05:28.415
Well, if you miss it so
much why don't you go back?

01:05:30.417 --> 01:05:32.285
I can't.

01:05:32.319 --> 01:05:34.754
But, you're a mercenary,
can't you fight on whatever

01:05:34.788 --> 01:05:36.289
side you want?

01:05:38.324 --> 01:05:40.226
Can I ask you a question?

01:05:41.493 --> 01:05:43.162
Yeah.

01:05:44.331 --> 01:05:46.232
You believe in the Outlaw, right?

01:05:46.266 --> 01:05:48.366
Yes.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.103
And you, you were born Banished, right?

01:05:53.306 --> 01:05:55.373
My grandparents were on the Second Exile

01:05:55.407 --> 01:05:56.942
after the water Jihad.

01:05:56.976 --> 01:05:58.478
Another generation.

01:06:01.647 --> 01:06:04.817
Well, what do you think
happens when somebody dies?

01:06:04.851 --> 01:06:09.355
Well, it depends on your affiliation.

01:06:09.389 --> 01:06:12.225
Different affiliations believe differently.

01:06:12.259 --> 01:06:15.527
Kim believes in reincarnation.

01:06:15.561 --> 01:06:17.897
Schorr, trans-enlightenment I think.

01:06:17.931 --> 01:06:20.633
Well, then maybe it's good he died young.

01:06:20.667 --> 01:06:22.402
What do you believe?

01:06:24.871 --> 01:06:28.175
You knew someone in
the attacks, didn't you?

01:06:30.409 --> 01:06:34.714
Well hey, maybe they survived.

01:06:34.748 --> 01:06:37.250
Devries had a piece of shit bubble.

01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:39.820
It barely stayed inflated on a good day.

01:06:43.056 --> 01:06:45.826
A javelin would've map
wiped them off the rock.

01:06:49.828 --> 01:06:53.698
My parents were lined
up and shot in a ditch

01:06:53.732 --> 01:06:56.602
in Mare Crisium.

01:06:56.636 --> 01:06:58.537
I hid with my sister
under a truck and watched

01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:00.741
the Death Squad pass.

01:07:07.714 --> 01:07:11.250
A lot of people died in Mare Crisium

01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:14.353
and those who survived...

01:07:16.656 --> 01:07:18.324
What?

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:21.761
They always ask that same question.

01:07:25.498 --> 01:07:27.934
Do you Banished have any answers?

01:07:36.442 --> 01:07:38.145
I'm sorry.

01:07:49.389 --> 01:07:52.424
His breathe is fritzed
and he's leaking voltage.

01:07:52.458 --> 01:07:55.328
Everything can't lead to nothing,

01:07:55.362 --> 01:07:56.830
sir.

01:07:58.031 --> 01:07:59.866
That's what I believe.

01:08:05.071 --> 01:08:08.975
Ah, we're gonna be
visible from high altitude.

01:08:12.411 --> 01:08:15.814
And, it makes us very slow moving.

01:08:15.848 --> 01:08:17.782
I'm right here guys.

01:08:17.816 --> 01:08:20.586
We're just discussing our options.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.354
And I got a beagle named
Armstrong that'll be

01:08:22.388 --> 01:08:24.889
severely disappointed if
those options don't include

01:08:24.923 --> 01:08:26.859
we walking him soon.

01:08:31.063 --> 01:08:32.965
Look at my finger.

01:08:34.466 --> 01:08:36.435
Good. How do you feel?

01:08:37.504 --> 01:08:39.973
Like 90% of me's on vacation.

01:08:41.441 --> 01:08:43.509
What did you hit me with?

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:45.911
Something to calm you
down, conserve your oxy.

01:08:47.645 --> 01:08:50.383
It's great shit.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:51.617
Well, you're not gonna like this,

01:08:51.651 --> 01:08:53.652
but I'm gonna need ya on your feet.

01:08:53.685 --> 01:08:57.590
If the pain gets too
bad I'll dial it back up.

01:08:57.624 --> 01:08:58.957
We don't want you burning too much air

01:08:58.991 --> 01:09:00.926
before we get evaced.

01:09:06.165 --> 01:09:09.501
You really think we're
gonna get outta here?

01:09:09.535 --> 01:09:11.536
I got to.

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:15.541
I'm not gonna add one more
to the Unlight body count.

01:09:15.575 --> 01:09:18.912
All right, we pound less than five.

01:09:35.227 --> 01:09:37.563
Trajectory plotted.

01:09:37.596 --> 01:09:38.863
Why are we setting up the Mofo nuke

01:09:38.897 --> 01:09:41.066
for auto deploy?

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.536
Just get on your feet, Kim.

01:09:43.569 --> 01:09:45.572
And, why is it pointing west?

01:09:48.707 --> 01:09:50.608
Because Gernsback is directly west.

01:09:50.642 --> 01:09:53.711
No, the
8-0-4 is west,

01:09:53.745 --> 01:09:55.915
Gurnsback's in the way.

01:09:57.517 --> 01:10:00.519
Aren't there rules against
this sorta thing, Dalton?

01:10:00.553 --> 01:10:02.854
This is our war.

01:10:02.888 --> 01:10:05.691
We're not gonna win it
by following their rules.

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:09.062
There are other ways outta this.

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:18.770
There isn't.

01:10:18.804 --> 01:10:22.275
There is no cache of
supplies, no comm rockets.

01:10:25.277 --> 01:10:27.112
All we have is to gang of
radios together and hope

01:10:27.146 --> 01:10:29.648
the signal's strong
enough to reach the 8-0-4.

01:10:29.682 --> 01:10:31.050
But, The Machine said...

01:10:31.084 --> 01:10:33.954
The Machine, The Machine lied.

01:10:35.554 --> 01:10:40.658
The whole south darkside
is all but unmapped.

01:10:40.692 --> 01:10:44.929
Our GPS sats are nothing
but Unlight target practice.

01:10:44.963 --> 01:10:49.101
So, even if there was anything
buried who could find it?

01:10:50.703 --> 01:10:53.639
So, you're gonna
indiscriminately wipe out a city

01:10:53.673 --> 01:10:55.741
of hundreds of people?

01:10:55.775 --> 01:10:57.344
Excuse me?

01:10:58.710 --> 01:10:59.644
They did.

01:10:59.678 --> 01:11:01.213
They can't help it.

01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:05.850
It took just

01:11:05.884 --> 01:11:07.553
two generations for everything to collapse

01:11:07.587 --> 01:11:09.787
after God was outlawed.

01:11:09.821 --> 01:11:13.092
And, everybody who believed
in anything was banished here.

01:11:14.893 --> 01:11:16.529
Families,

01:11:17.763 --> 01:11:20.032
countries,

01:11:20.066 --> 01:11:22.600
they all broke down.

01:11:22.634 --> 01:11:24.569
They're just a collection
of warring packs now,

01:11:24.603 --> 01:11:25.970
but we're different.

01:11:26.004 --> 01:11:29.140
Those warring packs they
carved up their world

01:11:29.174 --> 01:11:31.676
and when they were done
they carved up each other,

01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:33.578
and now they're here on yours.

01:11:33.612 --> 01:11:35.581
And, we're not any different.

01:11:35.615 --> 01:11:37.550
They just got a head start.

01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:42.088
No, it's compassion that
now lives and dies with us.

01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:47.060
We can slaughter armies
and sing a happy tune.

01:11:49.128 --> 01:11:50.728
But, I have to call foul at genocide.

01:11:50.762 --> 01:11:52.831
Corporal!

01:11:52.865 --> 01:11:54.733
All right, everybody stay glacial,

01:11:54.767 --> 01:11:55.968
that includes you Lang.

01:11:56.002 --> 01:11:59.037
Private, I'm giving you a direct order.

01:11:59.071 --> 01:12:00.672
The suits are recording everything Private

01:12:00.706 --> 01:12:03.309
so you better think about your options.

01:12:03.343 --> 01:12:06.612
You don't want everything
go on your permanent record.

01:12:08.146 --> 01:12:09.180
That's it.

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:48.821
Proximity warning, assault satellite.

01:12:57.896 --> 01:13:01.133
Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God.

01:13:01.167 --> 01:13:04.838
Warning, assault satellite
in firing position.

01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:14.380
Oh, it went right past us.

01:13:14.414 --> 01:13:15.913
We should be sad little
smears on the dark side

01:13:15.947 --> 01:13:17.816
of the moon right now.

01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:20.051
Why did it go right past us?

01:13:32.699 --> 01:13:35.000
Lang, run a geologic.

01:13:35.034 --> 01:13:37.202
There's no time, there
might be another bird

01:13:37.236 --> 01:13:38.370
right behind that one.

01:13:38.404 --> 01:13:39.837
We'd've already been greased.

01:13:39.871 --> 01:13:41.439
I want a full spectrum.

01:13:41.473 --> 01:13:42.974
The minute that thing
detonates the Unlights

01:13:43.008 --> 01:13:44.676
are gonna be out in force looking to see

01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:46.746
who pulled the trigger.

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.849
The moon is full of a
lot of funny magnetics,

01:13:50.883 --> 01:13:53.685
which is probably why
we're still alive right now.

01:13:53.719 --> 01:13:55.687
Run a geologic!

01:14:07.734 --> 01:14:10.503
Except, you know that I
can't let you fire that nuke.

01:14:13.772 --> 01:14:15.239
No?

01:14:15.273 --> 01:14:17.943
'Cause it looks to me like
you don't have a lot of choice.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.215
This is so stupid.

01:14:24.249 --> 01:14:26.117
You might as well do yourself
a favor and take my air

01:14:26.151 --> 01:14:28.886
because I will try and stop you.

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.488
That's the morphine talking.

01:14:30.522 --> 01:14:32.390
You might be under the false
assumption that I'm scared

01:14:32.424 --> 01:14:34.492
of dying, Dalton.

01:14:34.526 --> 01:14:36.295
Nope, but I wouldn't be surprised.

01:14:36.329 --> 01:14:38.996
Everyone's spooked of dying.

01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:43.335
No, not everybody.

01:14:43.369 --> 01:14:45.103
Why do you think the
Banished believe so strongly

01:14:45.137 --> 01:14:46.505
in their affiliations?

01:14:46.539 --> 01:14:47.872
Tradition.

01:14:47.906 --> 01:14:50.909
No, to make sense of the senseless.

01:14:51.977 --> 01:14:54.912
Right at the top of that list:

01:14:54.946 --> 01:14:56.815
What happens when you die.

01:14:58.284 --> 01:15:00.386
So, what the hell do you believe?

01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:07.358
I'm still working on that one.

01:15:13.231 --> 01:15:14.766
Dalton?

01:15:15.968 --> 01:15:17.236
I'm getting a funny data roll.

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:20.406
I'm reading that we're
not on lunar soil at all.

01:15:22.874 --> 01:15:26.010
If you tell me it's green cheese,

01:15:26.044 --> 01:15:27.345
I'm gonna have to shoot you.

01:15:27.379 --> 01:15:30.549
No, I'm reading it as trinitite?

01:15:31.883 --> 01:15:33.352
Trinitite?

01:15:35.588 --> 01:15:38.055
That's bullshit.

01:15:38.089 --> 01:15:39.825
No, it says trinitite.

01:15:39.859 --> 01:15:41.893
What is trinitite?

01:15:43.329 --> 01:15:45.029
Blast-phalt.

01:15:45.063 --> 01:15:47.899
Dirt turn to glass by a nuke.

01:15:47.933 --> 01:15:50.402
Jerusalem and Chibed were
filled with the stuff.

01:15:50.436 --> 01:15:52.804
But, that doesn't make any
sense, nobody's been out here.

01:15:52.838 --> 01:15:55.439
And, it's very reflective from orbit.

01:15:55.473 --> 01:15:58.010
So, someone fired off a nuke?

01:15:58.044 --> 01:15:59.478
Looks like.

01:15:59.512 --> 01:16:02.014
And, you think that's what
hit us from the batsat?

01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:08.153
Private, how big is the blast field?

01:16:08.187 --> 01:16:09.989
That's the thing,

01:16:12.959 --> 01:16:14.494
it's everywhere.

01:16:15.895 --> 01:16:18.130
And, there's no data on this?

01:16:18.164 --> 01:16:19.831
I guess no one's ever run a geologic

01:16:19.865 --> 01:16:21.465
from this vantage point.

01:16:21.499 --> 01:16:25.970
Private, I want you to
run a reverse blast sim.

01:16:26.004 --> 01:16:28.974
Extrapolate backwards from
the shape of the blast site

01:16:29.008 --> 01:16:31.410
to the moment of detonation.

01:16:31.444 --> 01:16:32.944
Why?

01:16:32.978 --> 01:16:35.112
You gonna try and map the hot spots?

01:16:35.146 --> 01:16:37.850
Then maybe we can determine
a way out of this shithole.

01:16:48.326 --> 01:16:49.361
Dang it.

01:16:51.396 --> 01:16:53.031
Damn it.

01:16:55.301 --> 01:16:56.868
Okay, okay, there must be something wrong

01:16:56.902 --> 01:16:57.737
with my wrist drive.

01:16:57.771 --> 01:16:59.170
I just ran this sim four different times

01:16:59.204 --> 01:17:00.371
and I keep getting the same thing.

01:17:00.405 --> 01:17:02.441
It doesn't make any sense.

01:17:02.475 --> 01:17:06.010
It's tracing the blast to 37 miles up,

01:17:06.044 --> 01:17:10.047
with a yield of 12 million kilotons.

01:17:10.081 --> 01:17:12.917
Well, that would split the moon in half.

01:17:12.951 --> 01:17:15.386
I know, that's what I thought, but look.

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.889
I ran the profile four different times,

01:17:16.923 --> 01:17:18.590
it all clicked the same.

01:17:18.624 --> 01:17:21.559
The sim's right, I'm
getting the same thing,

01:17:21.593 --> 01:17:23.895
but there's something else.

01:17:23.929 --> 01:17:27.198
The geologic rolled the
age of the trinitite,

01:17:27.232 --> 01:17:30.035
it's over three and a
half billion years old.

01:17:30.069 --> 01:17:32.004
Right, well there you go.

01:17:32.038 --> 01:17:35.139
A few radioactive
meteorites smash 'em together

01:17:35.173 --> 01:17:36.407
you get a shitload of trinitite.

01:17:36.441 --> 01:17:39.077
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:17:39.111 --> 01:17:42.214
Wracked merteorite'd splat
all over the solar system,

01:17:42.248 --> 01:17:45.050
but the only place the trinitite shows up

01:17:45.084 --> 01:17:47.920
is when nice people drop
bombs on one another.

01:17:47.954 --> 01:17:49.487
Well, there weren't any people around

01:17:49.521 --> 01:17:53.024
three and a half billion years
ago to lob nukes, Corporal.

01:17:53.058 --> 01:17:55.093
Obviously, someone was.

01:18:02.133 --> 01:18:04.068
Think about it.

01:18:04.102 --> 01:18:05.938
If we set off nukes to push ice shards in

01:18:05.972 --> 01:18:07.171
from the oort cloud all the time.

01:18:07.205 --> 01:18:09.041
But, this is the moon.

01:18:09.075 --> 01:18:12.111
Yeah, and why would
anyone wanna move the moon?

01:18:13.478 --> 01:18:15.147
Life.

01:18:16.214 --> 01:18:18.617
Come again?

01:18:18.651 --> 01:18:19.652
About three and a half billion years ago

01:18:19.686 --> 01:18:22.353
was when life started
showing up on Earth, right?

01:18:22.387 --> 01:18:24.656
Okay, this is crazy.

01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:27.326
The Earth is five billion years old.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.993
About a billion and a half years later...

01:18:29.027 --> 01:18:31.529
Okay, wait, wait so what you're saying

01:18:31.563 --> 01:18:33.698
is that the Earth didn't
have anything on it

01:18:33.732 --> 01:18:36.001
and then the moon is moved
and all of a sudden...

01:18:36.035 --> 01:18:38.269
Of all the planets with
moons in their solar system

01:18:38.303 --> 01:18:41.139
why are the moon and the
earth closest in size?

01:18:41.173 --> 01:18:43.541
That doesn't mean anything.

01:18:43.575 --> 01:18:45.711
The moon is just the
right size and distance

01:18:45.745 --> 01:18:48.448
in relation to the Earth for life to exist.

01:18:51.182 --> 01:18:54.318
If it had been a bit
bigger or closer the tides

01:18:54.352 --> 01:18:56.087
would've destroyed life
before it had a chance

01:18:56.121 --> 01:18:58.023
to do it's thing.

01:18:58.057 --> 01:19:02.094
If it was smaller or more
distant all those young organisms

01:19:02.128 --> 01:19:04.996
would of been obliterated by
the constant meteor bombardment

01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:07.198
that the moon's gravity
coincidentally sucked up

01:19:07.232 --> 01:19:09.502
as the solar system developed.

01:19:16.107 --> 01:19:18.477
Like what happened to the dinosaurs,

01:19:18.511 --> 01:19:20.646
only times a million.

01:19:23.048 --> 01:19:25.149
He's stalling.

01:19:25.183 --> 01:19:27.119
I wish I was.

01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:34.026
What are you buying time for?

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:35.928
I'm not making this up.

01:19:38.097 --> 01:19:39.430
I think he's telling the truth, Dalton.

01:19:39.464 --> 01:19:41.233
Shut up.

01:19:41.267 --> 01:19:43.100
Stow your gear, we get to ready to move out

01:19:43.134 --> 01:19:44.269
in three minutes.

01:19:44.303 --> 01:19:46.873
But, this does beg the question,

01:19:48.206 --> 01:19:51.143
who moved the moon?

01:19:51.177 --> 01:19:53.111
Private, stow your gear.

01:19:53.145 --> 01:19:56.113
The Almighty Outlaw moved the moon.

01:19:56.147 --> 01:19:58.083
How are we so sure?

01:19:59.218 --> 01:20:02.653
Because he, she, or it
moves in mysterious ways.

01:20:02.687 --> 01:20:05.424
Private, pick up those
guns and stow your gear!

01:20:05.458 --> 01:20:08.225
Maybe, maybe it wasn't the Outlaw at all.

01:20:08.259 --> 01:20:09.661
What?

01:20:09.695 --> 01:20:11.630
Do you know what you're saying?

01:20:11.664 --> 01:20:14.000
Maybe life on Earth wasn't created.

01:20:16.267 --> 01:20:18.169
Maybe it was engineered.

01:20:19.737 --> 01:20:21.740
Oh geez, Private.

01:20:23.142 --> 01:20:25.410
Stop pointing your gun at Corporal Kim.

01:20:25.444 --> 01:20:26.478
That's what you're doing.

01:20:26.512 --> 01:20:28.080
I outrank 'em.

01:20:28.114 --> 01:20:30.816
Look, just think about it.

01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:32.684
What might happen if
this information gets out?

01:20:32.718 --> 01:20:35.786
We would be mind wiped,
and moved back to the front

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.121
of the grinder.

01:20:37.155 --> 01:20:41.126
No, not if we transcast, share this data.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.127
To who?

01:20:43.161 --> 01:20:44.496
I don't know, everyone.

01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:45.464
Geez.

01:20:45.498 --> 01:20:47.431
The Banished, the Unlights,

01:20:47.465 --> 01:20:50.167
we spit on the omniband
like Liberation Leslie.

01:20:50.201 --> 01:20:52.269
It would be a race to
see who'd gack us first.

01:20:52.303 --> 01:20:55.074
No, don't you see?

01:20:56.307 --> 01:20:59.111
Both sides are gonna need us alive.

01:20:59.145 --> 01:21:00.112
That's the beauty of it.

01:21:00.146 --> 01:21:01.813
Why?

01:21:05.817 --> 01:21:07.786
Because, this could end the war.

01:21:10.388 --> 01:21:14.492
Suit and weapon integrity now connected.

01:21:17.362 --> 01:21:18.395
What was that?

01:21:18.429 --> 01:21:19.831
What was that?

01:21:19.865 --> 01:21:22.166
Chicken switch, he just locked the warhead

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.768
to his suit integrity.

01:21:23.802 --> 01:21:26.470
So, you can go ahead and shoot me,

01:21:26.504 --> 01:21:28.239
but you'd just be makin' a bigger crater.

01:21:43.856 --> 01:21:46.392
I've got a few hours left of air,

01:21:47.625 --> 01:21:49.794
either way I'm a dead woman.

01:21:51.463 --> 01:21:53.398
Kim, how could this end the war?

01:21:53.432 --> 01:21:55.332
Because, if the Almighty
Outlaw can make Heaven

01:21:55.366 --> 01:21:58.569
and Earth, then why the hell
does he need to move the moon

01:21:58.603 --> 01:22:00.371
with a thermonuclear war head?

01:22:00.405 --> 01:22:02.439
Well, who are we to question?

01:22:02.473 --> 01:22:05.544
Because we're the ones
that are dying in his name.

01:22:05.578 --> 01:22:09.348
And, if Creation was less than perfect,

01:22:10.848 --> 01:22:13.551
well maybe it wasn't by his hand at all.

01:22:13.585 --> 01:22:15.487
That is blasphemy.

01:22:15.521 --> 01:22:17.488
Maybe,

01:22:17.522 --> 01:22:19.890
but look at this data.

01:22:19.924 --> 01:22:22.760
It at least might be rich
enough to stop the shooting

01:22:22.794 --> 01:22:25.362
and get us all out of here in one piece.

01:22:25.396 --> 01:22:27.298
All of us.

01:22:28.801 --> 01:22:31.236
And, we don't have to
nuke any cities to do it,

01:22:32.271 --> 01:22:34.206
right?

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.340
All we gotta do is gang
our transmitters together

01:22:36.374 --> 01:22:39.344
to send out a signal strong enough to

01:22:39.378 --> 01:22:42.014
broadcast a little doubt to both sides.

01:22:44.249 --> 01:22:46.952
What war have you been fighting, soldier?

01:22:46.986 --> 01:22:48.853
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no

01:22:48.887 --> 01:22:51.689
Kim is right.

01:22:51.723 --> 01:22:52.957
This could end the war.

01:22:52.991 --> 01:22:55.695
Yes, with you losing.

01:22:59.365 --> 01:23:03.269
The Earth is dead, I know I'm from there.

01:23:04.335 --> 01:23:07.805
You Banished you learned
how to live off the land.

01:23:07.839 --> 01:23:12.143
You learned how to mine ice
from dirt to run your domes.

01:23:14.379 --> 01:23:16.447
The only reason the Unlights are here

01:23:16.481 --> 01:23:17.616
is because you're here.

01:23:17.650 --> 01:23:20.385
That's the only reason they're here.

01:23:20.419 --> 01:23:23.520
That's the only reason they want you dead.

01:23:23.554 --> 01:23:26.558
Don't you understand?

01:23:26.592 --> 01:23:29.426
It's got nothing to do
with your Almighty Outlaw,

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:33.331
or your affiliations, or
any of the other bullshit.

01:23:36.067 --> 01:23:39.504
The Almighty Outlaw, all
that other shit, is just

01:23:39.538 --> 01:23:40.438
they're excuse.

01:23:40.472 --> 01:23:42.974
Maybe,

01:23:43.008 --> 01:23:44.376
but it's also going to be the very thing

01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:45.609
that keeps us alive.

01:23:45.643 --> 01:23:48.580
And, aren't you sick of fighting?

01:23:48.614 --> 01:23:50.482
Aren't you sick of the
people you love dying

01:23:50.516 --> 01:23:51.649
for no reason?

01:23:51.683 --> 01:23:53.885
They already died for no reason.

01:23:53.919 --> 01:23:57.289
Yeah, that's what I thought, too.

01:23:58.324 --> 01:24:00.259
That's why I enlisted.

01:24:02.026 --> 01:24:04.562
But, I'm sick.

01:24:04.596 --> 01:24:07.831
I'm sick of living my life
in this walking toilet.

01:24:07.865 --> 01:24:09.567
I'm sick of the cold,

01:24:09.601 --> 01:24:12.304
the water that tastes like metal.

01:24:12.338 --> 01:24:14.305
I'm sick of the only
reason I have to wake up

01:24:14.339 --> 01:24:16.141
is to keep killing.

01:24:17.642 --> 01:24:20.644
Maybe they didn't die for this war.

01:24:20.678 --> 01:24:22.914
Maybe they died for peace.

01:24:25.517 --> 01:24:28.319
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:24:28.353 --> 01:24:29.987
You're not gonna agree
to gang our transmitters

01:24:30.021 --> 01:24:32.657
together, so

01:24:32.691 --> 01:24:35.894
if you wanna shoot me, go ahead.

01:24:35.928 --> 01:24:37.062
I'll understand.

01:24:37.096 --> 01:24:38.462
What are you talkin' about?

01:24:38.496 --> 01:24:39.496
Let her go, John.

01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:41.498
Where is she going?

01:24:41.532 --> 01:24:42.767
Where are you going?

01:24:43.936 --> 01:24:45.336
She's going to the Unlights.

01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:47.072
No, she's not.

01:24:47.106 --> 01:24:49.175
And, I'm going to the Banished.

01:25:06.657 --> 01:25:08.828
Hey. Hey!

01:25:18.803 --> 01:25:20.940
Halt.

01:25:26.678 --> 01:25:30.850
Listen, even if you make
it what is that gonna prove?

01:25:32.584 --> 01:25:36.520
You'll have sold out
everything you ever believed in.

01:25:36.554 --> 01:25:38.089
For what?

01:25:42.694 --> 01:25:45.964
Maybe faith needs to
be tested now and again.

01:25:45.998 --> 01:25:47.967
Maybe that's what this is.

01:25:55.173 --> 01:25:57.008
All right.

01:25:58.142 --> 01:25:59.911
I still have the nuke.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.782
I could change this entire landscape

01:26:03.816 --> 01:26:06.917
and erase history forever.

01:26:06.951 --> 01:26:09.053
I'm just being pragmatic.

01:26:10.755 --> 01:26:12.892
I don't think you will, sir.

01:26:16.661 --> 01:26:18.462
Don't test me.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.235
There's nothing left to test.

01:26:27.972 --> 01:26:29.441
I know you were the one that brought down

01:26:29.475 --> 01:26:30.976
our zoomer.

01:26:33.579 --> 01:26:35.612
You warned the Unlights
about the Zhukovskiy assault

01:26:35.646 --> 01:26:38.816
and you set up that contact
of yours to ambush us.

01:26:42.187 --> 01:26:45.958
Yet, here we are, still breathing.

01:26:49.761 --> 01:26:53.197
The Death Merchant of Tyco
is not gonna torch that nuke.

01:27:02.074 --> 01:27:04.809
You've suffered.

01:27:04.843 --> 01:27:07.313
Now, don't you wanna see
where everything leads?

01:27:17.755 --> 01:27:19.490
I need you both.

01:27:25.297 --> 01:27:27.299
Then, we gotta figure this out.

01:27:28.566 --> 01:27:30.101
Together.

01:27:32.971 --> 01:27:38.110
This is the end of the
road for us, all of us.

01:27:41.146 --> 01:27:43.715
If it doesn't change here then...

01:27:43.749 --> 01:27:46.584
Then they died for no reason.

01:27:46.618 --> 01:27:48.353
Yeah.

01:27:55.593 --> 01:27:57.228
The Banished believe that the Apocalypse

01:27:57.262 --> 01:27:59.130
will come as fire,

01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:07.705
the Unlights, drought.

01:28:09.674 --> 01:28:11.543
But, they're both wrong.

01:28:12.744 --> 01:28:14.713
The end will come as a flood,

01:28:16.181 --> 01:28:18.851
a flood of words.

01:28:22.219 --> 01:28:23.587
And, when that day comes

01:28:29.928 --> 01:28:31.696
which side will you be on?

01:28:52.835 --> 01:29:02.835
