02:22.275 --> 02:25.545
Whoa. This piece of shit.

02:50.635 --> 02:52.771
Shit, it's 300
all the way.

02:53.872 --> 02:56.376
Fly, drop, land, run.

02:57.475 --> 02:59.579
Don't go back to Mexico, ever.

03:22.634 --> 03:24.567
Hey, babe, just remember

03:24.569 --> 03:27.437
when you go to the grocery store
to pick up...

03:30.908 --> 03:32.910
- Hey.
- Where are you?

03:32.912 --> 03:34.711
Uh, where?
I'm on my flight.

03:34.713 --> 03:36.380
I'm talking on the Wi-Fi.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.816
- What, uh, whats wrong?
- I'm coming.

03:38.818 --> 03:41.221
- I'm just in the bathroom.
- Wait, is someone there with you?

03:41.986 --> 03:43.455
Megan came over.

03:44.522 --> 03:47.460
Uh, so, what's... whats wrong?

03:47.725 --> 03:48.794
Nothing's wrong.

03:50.262 --> 03:51.264
I feel good.

03:52.631 --> 03:53.699
I don't feel sick.

03:55.266 --> 03:58.401
Okay. Um, are you drinking?

03:58.403 --> 04:00.738
I've had
a few glasses of wine.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.444
- But I'm an adult. I can drink.
- I understand that.

04:04.776 --> 04:06.443
But, uh, did the doctor say
that was...

04:06.445 --> 04:08.347
The doctor says
it won't kill me, so...

04:08.546 --> 04:10.550
- is that enough of an answer?
- Its fine.

04:11.483 --> 04:12.718
You know what you're doing.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.391
Suddenly, you care?

04:21.694 --> 04:22.862
I always care.

04:35.007 --> 04:37.509
Just tell me that
everything's gonna be okay.

04:40.879 --> 04:44.548
Um, Jen, you know, you and Megan
go finish that wine,

04:44.550 --> 04:46.716
and I'm gonna be back
before you wake up. How's that?

04:46.718 --> 04:48.788
But you can't just say
everything's going to be okay?

04:50.355 --> 04:52.589
I'm working on it right now.

04:52.591 --> 04:53.558
Okay? Uh...

04:54.326 --> 04:57.795
Okay, um, I... I'm sorry, honey,
I got to go.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.697
- What was that noise?
- It was the... I'm just calling

04:59.699 --> 05:01.432
- the stewardess.
- I can't hear you. I...

05:01.434 --> 05:03.567
The seat belt sign just came on.
It's getting kind of bumpy.

05:03.569 --> 05:06.406
- Okay, well, call me later.
- Yep.

05:15.012 --> 05:16.515
My man, my man.

05:16.982 --> 05:18.418
Yes?

05:20.718 --> 05:23.656
- My man, can you hear me?
- Yes.

05:25.790 --> 05:26.957
You left so quick.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.528
Uh, yes, you said I was fighting
the morning.

05:32.398 --> 05:33.866
There's something
I need to tell you.

05:36.535 --> 05:38.671
But listen, there are reports.

05:40.805 --> 05:42.974
What... what reports?
Reports of what?

05:43.375 --> 05:45.011
They're packing up
on the border.

05:45.911 --> 05:49.680
Pa... packing up?
Okay, I dunno what you mean.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.115
- You mean they're...
- Yes, yes, my man.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.852
Right, they're leaving
or, like...

05:53.485 --> 05:54.752
I don't know.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.586
Okay, packing up, like,
leaving,

05:56.588 --> 05:58.557
or, like, you mean,
packing in?

05:59.391 --> 06:01.828
Radar, searchlights
all over the border.

06:11.502 --> 06:12.471
Hello?

06:25.750 --> 06:26.651
Hello?

06:29.420 --> 06:31.721
Do you... do you hear me?

06:33.759 --> 06:35.427
Hello? What's his name?

06:49.740 --> 06:50.742
It's okay.

06:52.009 --> 06:53.146
This would happen.

06:53.911 --> 06:55.647
You knew
this would happen.

06:56.648 --> 06:58.651
You are cool.

06:59.550 --> 07:00.652
Cool as...

07:12.964 --> 07:15.667
You're fine. Just do your job.

07:16.601 --> 07:18.069
Just do your job, Sean.

07:50.769 --> 07:51.870
What?

07:52.803 --> 07:54.005
Everything will be okay.

07:59.778 --> 08:00.680
Hi.

08:01.547 --> 08:02.482
Hi.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.653
You know,
you should apologize.

08:08.887 --> 08:09.922
For what?

08:10.254 --> 08:12.288
For the wholly
unnatural thoughts

08:12.290 --> 08:14.190
about your body you make
me have at night.

08:14.192 --> 08:16.127
Stop it.

08:17.596 --> 08:19.764
You're trying to be cute
and it's not working.

08:20.632 --> 08:22.033
Not eve... not even a little?

08:23.601 --> 08:25.770
Maybe a little.

08:29.274 --> 08:31.776
Uh, how long is Megan gonna
be there for?

08:32.244 --> 08:34.078
Not much longer.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.982
She's on the phone with Jeremy
right now.

08:36.581 --> 08:38.347
Their kid just split her chin
on the edge

08:38.350 --> 08:41.220
- of the coffee table.
- You really want one of those?

08:42.287 --> 08:43.523
A husband?

08:44.121 --> 08:45.824
Yeah, that's exactly
what I meant.

08:47.759 --> 08:49.762
I'll let you know
when I find one.

09:01.572 --> 09:03.543
I can't wait to have
a kid with you.

09:06.778 --> 09:09.749
Yeah, Sean, you know
that can't happen right now.

09:16.153 --> 09:17.155
I know.

09:19.857 --> 09:23.861
You know that... that moment
that all couples say they have,

09:23.863 --> 09:26.363
when the...
the house is a mess,

09:26.365 --> 09:27.797
and they're covered
in vomit,

09:27.799 --> 09:30.800
and the kid's, like,
finally sleeping for 45 minutes,

09:30.802 --> 09:33.806
and they look at each other
like, What the fuck did we do?

09:36.073 --> 09:38.910
I am... I am actually looking
forward to that.

09:41.947 --> 09:43.316
We're gonna be
great at it.

09:44.081 --> 09:45.116
We will...

09:48.253 --> 09:51.190
And I'm...
I'm done flying.

09:52.057 --> 09:53.893
After this, I'm done.

09:59.130 --> 10:00.632
Is everything okay?

10:01.966 --> 10:04.703
The last time you said that,
you left the Air Force.

10:31.028 --> 10:32.829
- Hey.
- Uh, yes?

10:35.866 --> 10:37.736
- Sean, can you hear me?
- Hello?

10:41.005 --> 10:42.707
Sean.

10:53.719 --> 10:54.820
Okay.

10:56.221 --> 10:58.356
It's okay, you knew
this would fucking happen.

10:59.356 --> 11:00.925
You knew this would happen.

11:07.331 --> 11:09.233
There's a change in plans.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.370
Uh, change? Change how?

11:11.836 --> 11:14.805
New drop zone.
Nothing you can't handle.

11:19.977 --> 11:22.080
Wait, that's...
That's 50 minutes away.

11:24.982 --> 11:27.118
Hello? Yeah, that is...
that's 50 minutes away.

11:28.153 --> 11:29.221
Take or give.

11:29.821 --> 11:32.089
Well, I barely have
enough fuel for that.

11:32.091 --> 11:35.126
You have enough, if you follow
the course, you have enough.

11:36.061 --> 11:38.829
Well, no, not really, this isn't
the plan, okay?

11:38.831 --> 11:41.098
- You can't just...
- My man, this is the plan.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.168
This is the new plan.

11:44.735 --> 11:47.436
Hey, hey, what was that?

11:47.438 --> 11:49.473
Uh, it's nothing.
It's the pressure.

11:49.475 --> 11:51.507
The oil pressure.
Uh, it's... it's fine.

11:51.509 --> 11:53.245
I copy you
on the new drop point.

11:58.082 --> 11:59.384
Jesus Christ.

12:03.288 --> 12:05.454
What?

12:05.456 --> 12:07.326
Oh, Jesus Christ!

12:18.736 --> 12:19.938
Fly.

12:21.139 --> 12:23.008
Fucking idiot.
Can't get a phone.

12:41.091 --> 12:42.961
Okay, so, what, that's...

12:43.894 --> 12:45.798
forty eight minutes out.

13:22.433 --> 13:23.566
Yes, what?

13:23.568 --> 13:25.301
Hey, sorry for the false start.

13:25.303 --> 13:27.403
Obviously having some trouble
setting up the secure line.

13:27.405 --> 13:28.907
What are you guys doing
at the border?

13:29.407 --> 13:32.041
What are you talking about?
We're not at the border.

13:32.043 --> 13:34.076
Don't lie to me.
They're fucking scared.

13:34.078 --> 13:37.214
- They already rerouted me.
- Do you have the laptop?

13:37.216 --> 13:38.417
- Is it secure?
- Yes.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.584
Good. That's good.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.252
No, I got to tell you,
something feels off about it...

13:43.254 --> 13:46.591
Hey, hey, Sean, you need
to focus on your wife.

13:47.826 --> 13:48.994
She needs to get better.

13:50.361 --> 13:52.130
You are doing
the right thing here.

13:53.530 --> 13:56.601
I promised you a new life
and treatment for your wife.

13:57.434 --> 13:58.369
Didn't I?

14:09.547 --> 14:10.582
I trust you.

14:11.349 --> 14:13.449
Don't start doubting that okay?

14:13.451 --> 14:14.685
Okay.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.421
I just wanna make sure
you understand what's expected

14:17.423 --> 14:19.024
of you here.

14:22.192 --> 14:24.896
Oh, shoot! Come on.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.987
What was that, Bloom?

14:49.989 --> 14:51.521
It was kinda hard
to follow this time.

14:51.523 --> 14:53.656
- What was hard to follow?
- That line of bullshit

14:53.658 --> 14:55.660
you love to read me about how
this is all for my own good.

14:57.895 --> 14:59.464
We have a good thing going here.

14:59.998 --> 15:02.299
Yeah, you give me a laptop,
I give you a new life.

15:02.301 --> 15:03.569
It's not bad for a night's work.

15:04.903 --> 15:06.502
I need those coordinates now.

15:06.504 --> 15:08.372
Yeah, when I get them,
you'll be the first to know.

15:08.374 --> 15:09.473
What do you mean?

15:09.475 --> 15:10.975
You said they already sent them
to you.

15:11.442 --> 15:12.377
Bye.

15:23.654 --> 15:26.324
So, 50...

15:28.460 --> 15:31.363
minutes of fuel, 48 minutes out.

15:33.163 --> 15:34.564
That's fucking...

15:56.488 --> 15:57.787
That's fucking...

15:59.591 --> 16:00.656
Yes?

16:00.658 --> 16:02.061
Hey, what happened?

16:02.626 --> 16:05.029
Happened? Uh, sorry?

16:05.263 --> 16:07.599
You just climbed suddenly.
Is there a problem?

16:08.033 --> 16:09.735
No. No, no, no.
No problem.

16:10.434 --> 16:13.203
From this point on,
you check in every 10 minutes.

16:13.205 --> 16:14.637
- Okay, what, I...
- I want updates.

16:14.639 --> 16:16.475
I just call you on this line?

16:18.243 --> 16:20.212
This behavior
is not good, my man.

16:21.111 --> 16:22.747
We have decided
to change your terms.

16:23.214 --> 16:25.515
What do you mean, change?
What behavior? What do you...

16:25.517 --> 16:27.019
Hey!

16:31.022 --> 16:31.724
Hello?

16:39.063 --> 16:40.098
Hello!

16:51.775 --> 16:53.478
It's fine, it's fine.

17:08.259 --> 17:09.361
Sean?

17:14.432 --> 17:15.467
Sean?

17:18.569 --> 17:20.105
Were you talking to someone?

17:20.738 --> 17:22.106
Talking to you.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.210
Thinking out loud.

17:27.679 --> 17:29.114
Did you get my voicemail?

17:30.115 --> 17:32.181
Um, I'd rather hear it
from a horse's mouth.

17:32.183 --> 17:33.117
What... what was it?

17:33.785 --> 17:34.820
It's just for...

17:35.452 --> 17:37.423
for when you land,
for the drive home.

17:39.523 --> 17:40.491
Um...

17:42.160 --> 17:43.528
Uh, tell me
about your day.

17:44.561 --> 17:47.265
Oh, my day, my day,

17:47.832 --> 17:50.235
my day...
What'd I do today?

17:52.537 --> 17:53.739
Well, I...

17:55.373 --> 17:56.842
lay in bed for a while.

17:58.175 --> 17:59.811
This new medicine
makes me feel like shit.

18:01.746 --> 18:04.283
Can't wait to get this
damn operation over with.

18:05.349 --> 18:07.485
Then I did laundry
and thought about you.

18:07.818 --> 18:11.190
And then I took a bath, so,
I could really think about you.

18:11.823 --> 18:13.722
Then I decided
the next time you take

18:13.724 --> 18:15.959
a long transport contract
with the Peace Corps,

18:15.961 --> 18:17.328
I'm coming with you.

18:20.298 --> 18:22.399
- Shit!
- What happened?

18:22.401 --> 18:23.836
Oh, I popped a button.

18:24.836 --> 18:26.569
Too many burritos.

18:26.571 --> 18:28.873
Uh, no, they don't have burritos
here. It's just...

18:29.406 --> 18:32.877
It's plates of rice and beans
and the occasional tough flank.

18:34.244 --> 18:36.912
Ugh, sounds like the makings
of a disgusting burrito to me.

18:36.914 --> 18:39.415
No, I guess they do.
Yeah, they have burritos here.

18:39.417 --> 18:40.816
But they're... theyre different.

18:40.818 --> 18:43.286
Everything is a little bit
off here, you know?

18:43.288 --> 18:45.223
Like some bizarro
Corpus Christi.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.769
It's so beautiful this time.

19:01.138 --> 19:03.674
Those thin clouds are out, so...

19:04.576 --> 19:07.179
it's all blue,
with orange streaks.

19:08.645 --> 19:11.916
- Mm-hmm.
- You didn't see it, did you?

19:14.251 --> 19:15.384
What?

19:15.386 --> 19:17.388
We watched the sunset together.
I... I...

19:17.922 --> 19:19.423
I know it's stupid, but...

19:20.290 --> 19:22.859
they sent you to the same
time zone this time,

19:22.861 --> 19:24.530
and we don't always get
this lucky.

19:27.298 --> 19:28.400
It helps.

19:32.470 --> 19:33.438
Sean?

19:36.574 --> 19:37.776
Are you even listening?

20:14.444 --> 20:15.547
Worst.

21:00.391 --> 21:02.628
What? Jesus Christ!

21:16.540 --> 21:17.643
Ah, fuck!

21:23.413 --> 21:25.783
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi, Bloom.

21:26.951 --> 21:29.421
- Pretty cool, huh?
- What are you doing?

21:30.020 --> 21:31.355
It's a drone.

21:31.888 --> 21:33.690
Yeah, I can see that.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.861
I love it.

21:36.594 --> 21:39.094
It's got a feed that streams
straight to my phone,

21:39.096 --> 21:41.432
so I can watch it
on the shitter, if I want to.

21:46.570 --> 21:49.439
Man, I thought this relationship
was built on trust.

21:49.441 --> 21:52.875
No, truth is,
this relationship is

21:52.877 --> 21:54.879
built on paranoia and fear.

21:56.646 --> 21:59.449
But you'll be happy
to know that I now

21:59.451 --> 22:01.817
trust that you'll do
the right thing here.

22:01.819 --> 22:02.721
Is that clear?

22:04.788 --> 22:05.923
Are we good?

22:12.763 --> 22:15.099
I can't talk right now.
Hi, honey.

22:16.067 --> 22:18.470
Hi. I'm sorry.
This is Statewide Health.

22:19.036 --> 22:20.903
- Excuse me?
- Yes, we handle

22:20.905 --> 22:22.639
all insurance claims
through your

22:22.641 --> 22:23.642
Peace Corps program.

22:24.742 --> 22:26.042
I was wondering if I could have
a minute of your time.

22:26.044 --> 22:28.844
Uh, look, I'm really sorry.
I don't mean to be

22:28.846 --> 22:30.779
a dick right now,
but no, you can't.

22:30.781 --> 22:32.715
Um, and it's the middle
of the night.

22:32.717 --> 22:35.017
Yes, I apologize, sir,
but there's an issue

22:35.019 --> 22:37.756
- with your wife.
- What?

22:38.455 --> 22:40.222
The claim you filed
for your wife.

22:40.224 --> 22:42.057
Oh, right. No. Well, no.

22:42.059 --> 22:44.061
You know, yeah,
call back another time.

22:44.494 --> 22:46.629
Oh, no. Hey, wait.
Are you there?

22:46.631 --> 22:48.934
- Sir?
- Uh, what's... whats the issue?

22:49.133 --> 22:50.834
Uh, the estimate for some

22:50.836 --> 22:53.102
of these procedures
are being contested.

22:53.104 --> 22:54.837
Yeah, I know,
and then you guys denied her

22:54.839 --> 22:56.972
after you spoke
with the goddamn medical folks.

22:56.974 --> 22:59.241
Mm-hmm, I understand
she needs a procedure

22:59.243 --> 23:01.712
for ovarian cancer.
Is that correct?

23:02.380 --> 23:03.115
Yes.

23:04.015 --> 23:05.949
I have sympathy
for these difficult times.

23:05.951 --> 23:07.984
But coverage
for a Peace Corps contract

23:07.986 --> 23:09.020
isn't that extensive.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.123
Who was your previous insurer?

23:11.721 --> 23:13.722
It was
the United States Air Force.

23:13.724 --> 23:15.426
Okay. That helps.

23:16.827 --> 23:19.062
Yes, well, I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you...

23:19.064 --> 23:21.096
Sorry, you have
to call me back, okay?

23:21.098 --> 23:22.000
Sir...

23:25.769 --> 23:26.837
I should go.

23:41.986 --> 23:43.789
Come on, Sean.
It's not hard.

24:07.178 --> 24:08.647
Uh, hey.

24:10.448 --> 24:11.716
I have to ask
you something.

24:13.483 --> 24:14.552
Okay.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.221
When are you getting home?

24:18.655 --> 24:20.524
Uh, I don't know. Soon.

24:21.826 --> 24:23.094
Are you gonna be hungry?

24:25.962 --> 24:28.163
Uh... I don't know.

24:28.165 --> 24:29.733
Is that what you wanted
to ask me?

24:32.702 --> 24:33.771
Megan's gone.

24:35.105 --> 24:37.273
Okay, good.
Then, um, yeah,

24:37.275 --> 24:38.576
you can get some sleep.

24:47.785 --> 24:49.852
Jen, please,
can you just, like,

24:49.854 --> 24:51.756
have another glass
of pinot and pass out?

24:52.022 --> 24:53.491
It's not pinot, it's...

24:54.959 --> 24:56.325
sauvignon blanc, Sean.

24:56.327 --> 24:58.730
Whatever it is, kill it.
I'll see you when I get home.

25:05.702 --> 25:07.071
Why were you in Mexico?

25:11.509 --> 25:13.610
What do you mean? I was...
I was building a school

25:13.612 --> 25:15.547
- for the Peace Corps.
- Don't do this, Sean!

25:18.281 --> 25:21.118
Please stop thinking
that I'm a fucking idiot.

25:23.788 --> 25:24.722
Jesus.

25:25.923 --> 25:28.527
I'm sick,
and we don't have any money.

25:29.125 --> 25:31.997
So why do you keep saying
that everything will be okay?

25:33.096 --> 25:34.764
I have a deal worked out

25:34.766 --> 25:36.567
with the Peace Corps,
with the doctors.

25:36.968 --> 25:38.735
You're not working out a deal

25:38.737 --> 25:40.639
as a Peace Corps
contractor, Sean.

25:41.071 --> 25:43.007
They haven't sent you
anywhere in months.

25:43.673 --> 25:45.408
What the fuck are you
doing in Mexico?

25:45.410 --> 25:48.079
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.
Thats... that's not fair.

25:49.279 --> 25:50.848
I called Dave, Sean.

25:51.682 --> 25:54.049
Wait, wait, you called
the Peace Corps Dave?

25:54.051 --> 25:56.052
- How did you get his number?
- Yes, Peace Corps Dave.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.819
They didn't send you
anywhere this week.

25:57.821 --> 25:59.822
It sure as hell wasn't
the Air Force.

25:59.824 --> 26:02.691
Jen, we should not be talking
about this right now, okay?

26:02.693 --> 26:05.294
Oh, no, well, I'll be able
to change the damn locks

26:05.296 --> 26:07.265
- before you get home.
- Jen, don't...

26:07.964 --> 26:08.899
Jen!

26:09.834 --> 26:12.070
Come on! Jesus Christ!

26:15.705 --> 26:16.707
Shoot.

26:36.826 --> 26:38.630
Let's see
how good you are.

26:46.871 --> 26:48.073
Come on, come on!

26:57.381 --> 26:58.617
Come on!

27:23.140 --> 27:24.075
Yep.

27:25.108 --> 27:26.778
Come on. Come on.

27:52.769 --> 27:53.738
Yes!

28:08.219 --> 28:09.153
Yep.

28:20.029 --> 28:21.031
You're fine.

28:21.464 --> 28:22.766
Just do your job.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.036
Just do your job, Sean.

29:14.218 --> 29:16.387
Uh, are you...

29:38.509 --> 29:42.079
Um... Hey, can you roll down
the window?

29:46.115 --> 29:48.987
Or turn on the air,
please?

29:56.192 --> 29:57.796
Honey, they, um...

30:00.530 --> 30:02.099
they gave me a bonus.

30:02.298 --> 30:03.433
They... Fuck.

30:44.375 --> 30:45.276
Passport.

30:46.343 --> 30:49.144
- What?
- My man, my man, come on...

30:49.146 --> 30:51.180
No. Uh, no.
We don't do that.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.616
That's never been
part of the deal.

31:01.224 --> 31:03.159
When you came into Mexico,
they stamped you in

31:03.161 --> 31:04.162
at the airport, no?

31:06.163 --> 31:08.331
- Yes.
- And when you leave,

31:08.333 --> 31:09.334
we stamp you out.

31:23.247 --> 31:24.916
Satellite phone, GPS.

31:25.182 --> 31:26.582
You leave everything
when you land.

31:26.584 --> 31:28.219
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know. I know.

31:31.922 --> 31:34.125
You have enough fuel
to make it to the drop.

31:34.490 --> 31:36.294
- How much fuel?
- Enough.

31:38.162 --> 31:39.728
But you need to leave now.
You're fighting

31:39.730 --> 31:41.332
against the morning
at this point.

31:41.565 --> 31:45.133
- Uh, what the hell's that?
- That is your cargo.

31:45.135 --> 31:46.270
Well, that's...

31:46.537 --> 31:49.039
Its supposed to be 25 kilos.
It has to be double that.

31:49.339 --> 31:50.540
It is what it is.

32:25.942 --> 32:28.309
Jen, I'm sorry, okay?
I don't have time

32:28.311 --> 32:30.379
for this right now.
Please just go to sleep.

32:30.381 --> 32:32.250
I don't have time
for this either.

32:36.252 --> 32:37.719
If something happened to you

32:37.721 --> 32:39.523
doing whatever it is
youre doing,

32:40.490 --> 32:41.992
where would that leave me?

32:44.127 --> 32:47.129
Just please try not to think
about that right now, okay?

32:47.131 --> 32:49.367
Just believe me.
I know... I know what I'm doing.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.301
Oh, shit.

32:52.001 --> 32:54.804
- What?
- That car is back.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.975
- What car?
- Some car keeps...

32:57.974 --> 33:00.110
coming to the driveway,
turning around.

33:01.111 --> 33:02.678
Must be lost. I don't know.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.215
What was that?

33:04.647 --> 33:06.815
- Jen!
- Broke a wine glass.

33:06.817 --> 33:10.385
- Okay, Jen, lock the doors.
- I just got these!

33:12.221 --> 33:13.223
Shoot!

33:38.147 --> 33:39.381
- Sean.
- Hey,

33:39.383 --> 33:41.249
did you send someone
to my house?

33:41.251 --> 33:42.785
Jen says there's someone
in my driveway.

33:42.787 --> 33:44.120
What? No. Why would I?

33:44.122 --> 33:46.154
If I find out that you send
your boys around there, I...

33:46.156 --> 33:47.591
You said she was out of t...

33:48.092 --> 33:49.557
- Jen!
- This is Karen

33:49.559 --> 33:52.128
- with Statewide Insurance.
- Oh, Jesus! What the f...

33:52.130 --> 33:53.562
- Sir?
- You guys just called me, okay?

33:53.564 --> 33:55.131
Its not a good time.

33:55.133 --> 33:57.333
Uh, we must've had
our logs crossed.

33:57.335 --> 33:59.735
Yeah, just call
the Air Force insurance office.

33:59.737 --> 34:01.269
They will tell you
Sean Haggerty was

34:01.271 --> 34:04.472
dishonorably discharged, and all
benefits were revoked, got that?

34:04.474 --> 34:06.508
Okay, Mr. Haggerty,
we'll get right on that.

34:06.510 --> 34:07.444
Thank you.

34:11.380 --> 34:12.583
What the fuck?

35:23.219 --> 35:24.353
Yep.

35:24.355 --> 35:25.655
Is this Sean Haggerty?

35:29.259 --> 35:30.592
Uh, this is, yeah.

35:30.594 --> 35:34.498
Sean, I'm calling
on behalf of your employer.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.199
Is there a problem?

35:36.666 --> 35:37.869
What employer?

35:38.434 --> 35:39.871
Do you have more than one?

35:41.838 --> 35:43.905
Uh, nope. No, no.

35:43.907 --> 35:45.143
I read you.

35:45.541 --> 35:46.777
Is there a problem?

35:48.512 --> 35:49.714
No. No problem.

35:50.780 --> 35:51.849
That's good.

35:52.815 --> 35:55.919
Yeah, everything's on schedule.

35:56.519 --> 35:57.722
That's good news.

36:00.657 --> 36:02.160
I'm going to be frank.

36:03.927 --> 36:05.429
Theres suspicions.

36:06.496 --> 36:08.530
What do you... What do you mean,
suspicions? No.

36:08.532 --> 36:11.235
I'm doing everything you want.
The package is on time.

36:11.434 --> 36:14.438
Nevertheless,
our employer has suspicions.

36:16.606 --> 36:20.710
No one in particular, but still,
you should be aware.

36:22.278 --> 36:24.947
You can trust me.
Of course you can trust me.

36:24.949 --> 36:28.516
- Um, what's your name, sir?
- Mallory.

36:28.518 --> 36:30.887
Mr. Mallory, I guarantee you
that nothing is wrong.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.456
Everything is going off
according to the plan.

36:36.492 --> 36:38.762
Guarantees mean
a great deal to me.

36:42.465 --> 36:45.603
I told our employer
that I guarantee

36:46.202 --> 36:48.704
every package they have
crossing the border today

36:48.706 --> 36:50.240
will arrive safely.

36:55.512 --> 36:57.315
You don't have to worry
about me.

36:58.614 --> 36:59.883
I know I don't.

37:09.726 --> 37:11.429
Is... is there
anything else, sir?

37:12.228 --> 37:12.996
No.

37:13.864 --> 37:15.733
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

37:21.605 --> 37:22.804
I'll be in touch.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.449
Shit. Shit.

38:01.043 --> 38:02.045
Okay.

38:05.949 --> 38:07.784
Shit.

38:12.556 --> 38:14.492
Come on, come on, come on.

38:15.358 --> 38:17.327
Hey, this is Jen.
Leave a message.

38:18.661 --> 38:21.530
Uh, hey, Jen. Uh, it's me.

38:21.532 --> 38:24.099
Um, I... I... I hope
you're sleeping,

38:24.101 --> 38:27.637
but still, if you get this,
can you just call me back?

38:28.704 --> 38:30.040
Okay. Thanks.

38:57.534 --> 38:58.669
Spread 'em.

39:05.409 --> 39:06.977
That's... That's my payment?

39:08.744 --> 39:10.780
You're not packing, John Rambo?

39:14.016 --> 39:15.418
Uh, no.

39:16.385 --> 39:17.487
I'm not packing.

39:19.456 --> 39:20.557
Why not?

39:27.396 --> 39:29.532
And we normally, we...
we just call him Rambo.

39:32.702 --> 39:33.738
Rambo.

40:31.628 --> 40:34.498
Drugs, a laptop, anything else
you want me to carry?

41:02.925 --> 41:04.694
Hey,
this is Jen. Leave a message.

41:05.862 --> 41:07.932
Uh, Jen, I... I... Look...

41:08.465 --> 41:10.032
Uh, it's me again.

41:10.034 --> 41:13.068
I'm... I'm...
If you get this, I know, I...

41:13.070 --> 41:14.802
If you get this
and you don't want to talk,

41:14.804 --> 41:16.104
I... I... I get it, I understand.

41:16.106 --> 41:18.042
But, please can you just
text me or something?

41:18.474 --> 41:20.243
Okay. Uh, I love you.

41:23.813 --> 41:25.213
- Jen?
- Sean, buddy,

41:25.215 --> 41:26.313
I'm getting tired of this.

41:26.315 --> 41:28.684
- Just tell the coordinates, now.
- I don't have them.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.985
You give me that laptop,
Jen gets her surgery.

41:30.987 --> 41:32.854
Thats the deal.
Don't forget it.

41:32.856 --> 41:34.322
Yeah, believe me,
I haven't, okay?

41:34.324 --> 41:36.691
I know you're not doing this
cause we're old pals.

41:36.693 --> 41:38.693
I can get you what you want.
Just give me a few seconds

41:38.695 --> 41:41.063
- to myself, please.
- Where is the drop?

41:41.065 --> 41:43.197
Tell me now or I'm going
to lose my shit!

41:43.199 --> 41:45.833
What does it even matter?
I thought you had a crack team

41:45.835 --> 41:47.270
of Nevada Top Guns tracking me.

41:48.137 --> 41:49.371
Hey, boys!

41:49.373 --> 41:51.238
If you want us to protect you,
we need to know where

41:51.240 --> 41:53.342
you're going to be.
I don't want a camera

41:53.344 --> 41:55.713
circling your corpse
from 300 feet above.

41:58.213 --> 42:01.782
- Haggerty?
- Shit. Shit!

42:01.784 --> 42:03.586
- Hey, what's going on up there?
- Shoot!

42:04.054 --> 42:06.854
Sean I have a team standing by.

42:06.856 --> 42:08.592
- Okay? You just...
- Yeah, I got to go.

42:10.860 --> 42:12.295
Okay, well, what is this, now?

42:12.896 --> 42:13.964
Hello?

42:15.699 --> 42:16.634
Jen?

42:17.766 --> 42:19.168
Do you love your wife?

42:20.637 --> 42:21.605
Mallory.

42:23.306 --> 42:24.840
I will ask again...

42:24.842 --> 42:27.275
Okay, listen to me, asshole.
I'm not gonna fucking sit up...

42:27.277 --> 42:28.945
Do you love your wife?

42:34.751 --> 42:35.819
Yes, I do.

42:38.688 --> 42:39.789
Say it louder.

42:40.824 --> 42:43.626
I... I love my wife.

42:58.574 --> 43:00.176
Now, I need you
to understand that

43:00.643 --> 43:03.012
this has absolutely nothing
to do with you.

43:03.346 --> 43:05.014
I was called into service

43:05.748 --> 43:08.117
because a problem was
discovered at the airfield.

43:08.617 --> 43:10.385
Uh, what... what problem?

43:10.387 --> 43:13.287
Again, nothing to do with you.

43:13.289 --> 43:15.224
- Oh, God... What...
- But to be safe,

43:16.092 --> 43:18.193
extra measures needed
to be put in place

43:18.195 --> 43:19.860
- in order to ensure that...
- Extra measures?

43:19.862 --> 43:21.463
...the plan is carried out
to its conclusion.

43:21.465 --> 43:23.898
So are we clear?

43:23.900 --> 43:27.235
- You do understand?
- Th... This is a mistake!

43:27.237 --> 43:29.271
You don't have to do this.
We're not gonna be...

43:29.273 --> 43:30.140
Okay.

43:31.840 --> 43:34.210
I'm gonna explain
how all this is gonna play out.

43:36.378 --> 43:38.412
The new coordinates
have been uploaded

43:38.414 --> 43:40.250
to your craft.
Will you confirm?

43:43.052 --> 43:45.288
- Yes.
- You will land there.

43:46.155 --> 43:48.090
I'll be waiting
to collect the cargo

43:48.092 --> 43:50.860
and the craft.
Your wife will be with me.

43:53.195 --> 43:55.199
Well, how... how can I trust you?

43:56.298 --> 43:57.800
Because you must.

44:01.036 --> 44:04.207
- She has a condition.
- Yes, we know. We know.

44:04.840 --> 44:07.176
She has pills that she has
to take in the morning.

44:07.876 --> 44:09.211
Once we determine

44:09.213 --> 44:10.748
that the cargo and the craft

44:11.748 --> 44:13.083
are unmolested,

44:14.117 --> 44:15.986
you and Jen will be set free,

44:18.054 --> 44:19.887
and there'll be
plenty of time to take

44:19.889 --> 44:21.257
all the pills she needs.

44:23.425 --> 44:25.996
Now, would you like to speak
with your wife, Sean?

44:29.164 --> 44:30.199
Hello?

44:32.434 --> 44:34.003
Jen, where are you?

44:36.405 --> 44:38.275
I don't know. I'm in a car.

44:39.842 --> 44:42.778
I was in the kitchen,
and the next thing I knew,

44:42.780 --> 44:45.916
they dragged me out,
and I'm here in a car. I dont...

44:46.349 --> 44:48.516
Listen, we... we have a way out.

44:48.518 --> 44:50.119
I'm coming for you right now.

44:51.887 --> 44:53.023
What did you do?

44:54.056 --> 44:57.559
I... I... it doesn't matter
right now, okay,

44:57.561 --> 44:59.894
but I... I'm sorry.
And I'm gonna...

44:59.896 --> 45:01.097
I'm coming to get you.

45:01.965 --> 45:04.802
I don't. I don't.

45:06.335 --> 45:07.437
Wait, but...

45:08.371 --> 45:10.773
I don't know what
to do right now.

45:13.909 --> 45:14.877
I'm sorry.

45:19.148 --> 45:21.018
Everything is going perfectly.

45:22.351 --> 45:25.855
I've been in this position
many times before. I know.

45:26.789 --> 45:27.891
You're doing great.

45:29.224 --> 45:33.230
There's an exercise I'd like to
leave with you when I hang up.

45:34.831 --> 45:37.164
You should make a list
of all the things

45:37.166 --> 45:39.135
that you love about your wife.

45:40.003 --> 45:41.238
But, more importantly,

45:42.838 --> 45:45.476
you should make a list
of all the things you'll miss

45:46.275 --> 45:48.846
if she were to be suddenly
taken away from you.

46:09.231 --> 46:10.800
You are a sick fuck.

46:11.967 --> 46:14.337
I say these things just
for your own good, Sean,

46:15.003 --> 46:16.038
and for Jen.

46:37.059 --> 46:37.994
Fuck!

46:49.072 --> 46:52.108
Fucking fail at
fucking everything!

47:55.103 --> 47:57.371
- I'm here.
- You have to shut it down, okay?

47:57.373 --> 47:59.708
The operation,
whatever you're calling it.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.108
Just not... not this time.

48:01.110 --> 48:02.711
Signed the paperwork
this morning, buddy.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.746
Got your new name,
background, right here.

48:04.748 --> 48:06.081
You and Jen.

48:06.083 --> 48:08.516
Don't try to change things,
Sean. You're an asset.

48:08.518 --> 48:11.753
I'm a fucking pilot, okay?
I flew night sorties and I... I...

48:11.755 --> 48:13.023
Nobody cares.

48:13.322 --> 48:15.990
The Navy, FAA's not gonna
let you anywhere

48:15.992 --> 48:17.226
near a pilot's license.

48:17.527 --> 48:19.128
You're a drug mule, Sean,

48:19.329 --> 48:21.198
a beast of burden
on borrowed time.

48:22.197 --> 48:24.400
Don't think for a second
you're anything more.

48:28.003 --> 48:29.239
They have Jen.

48:30.907 --> 48:33.076
- Who does?
- They took her.

48:34.210 --> 48:36.380
- They took her?
- Yes, they took her.

48:38.081 --> 48:39.481
What the fuck are you
trying to pull?

48:39.483 --> 48:41.081
Yeah, they were
at my house, okay?

48:41.083 --> 48:42.685
They took her.
That's all that matters.

48:44.186 --> 48:45.787
- Who has her?
- I don't know.

48:45.789 --> 48:47.789
Some guy named,
uh, Mallory.

48:47.791 --> 48:49.490
He's... hes taking her
to the drop point.

48:49.492 --> 48:51.661
I'm landing there.
So the plans have changed.

48:53.996 --> 48:55.197
Do they know about me?

48:55.965 --> 48:57.398
Do they know about
what we're doing?

48:57.400 --> 48:59.467
I don't know.
I don't think so, okay?

48:59.469 --> 49:01.436
The guy said it has
nothing to do with me.

49:01.438 --> 49:04.572
I... I don't know why,
but, I believe him.

49:04.574 --> 49:05.675
Hm. You trust him?

49:06.476 --> 49:07.708
I don't... I don't...

49:07.710 --> 49:09.577
I'm not saying I trust him.
I'm saying I believe

49:09.579 --> 49:10.644
what he says.

49:10.646 --> 49:13.748
Okay, Sean. I can help you.

49:13.750 --> 49:16.784
No, you can help me
by staying out of this, okay?

49:16.786 --> 49:18.519
You need to stay out of this.

49:18.521 --> 49:21.123
When did you get permission
to give me fucking orders, huh?

49:21.690 --> 49:24.092
You will fly, you will land,

49:24.094 --> 49:26.530
and you will stall
until we can secure you,

49:26.963 --> 49:29.365
your... fucking wife,

49:30.166 --> 49:32.269
this Mallory, and anybody
he has with him.

49:33.135 --> 49:35.135
And only when I deem you worthy

49:35.137 --> 49:37.104
of being released
from my custody

49:37.106 --> 49:40.376
will you be allowed to start
your new, pathetic life

49:40.643 --> 49:43.413
in whatever town,
backwater America.

49:45.213 --> 49:47.284
You will get me
that laptop, Sean.

49:48.251 --> 49:50.354
It cannot fall
into the wrong hands.

50:03.365 --> 50:04.467
Sorry, Bloom.

50:05.434 --> 50:08.170
What? Sorry for what?
What are you talking about?

50:10.739 --> 50:13.743
Sean, what are you...
What's going on?

50:16.746 --> 50:18.215
What the fuck was that?

50:19.315 --> 50:21.316
Sean, what are you doing?

50:21.318 --> 50:22.684
Stop it!

50:22.686 --> 50:24.287
Sean,
you don't wanna do that!

50:25.288 --> 50:28.324
What the fuck is wrong?

50:29.759 --> 50:31.695
- Sean? Can you hear me?
- God damn it. Fuck!

50:33.795 --> 50:35.064
Fuck!

50:36.666 --> 50:39.534
- Drone's down.
- We'll be in touch.

50:46.576 --> 50:50.480
Okay, so, what are we?
Uh... 50 degrees north

50:51.114 --> 50:54.717
by... okay, so, figure
in 30 minutes.

50:55.451 --> 50:56.385
Great.

51:19.175 --> 51:20.110
Okay.

51:29.452 --> 51:32.189
Um... fine.

51:32.788 --> 51:34.458
Ah...

51:48.804 --> 51:49.840
Okay.

52:03.119 --> 52:05.653
- Uh, this is Sean.
- Are you on schedule?

52:05.655 --> 52:08.258
Uh, yeah, I'm set to land
in 30 minutes.

52:08.657 --> 52:11.425
When you land,
you will exit the aircraft.

52:11.427 --> 52:12.661
Perfect. I'll see you there.

52:13.295 --> 52:15.496
Once the package
has been secured,

52:15.498 --> 52:16.666
your wife will be released.

52:17.199 --> 52:20.603
And when you land, exit
and step away from the aircraft.

52:20.835 --> 52:22.003
Slowly.

52:22.005 --> 52:24.005
I would not want to have to fire
on you.

52:24.007 --> 52:26.441
No. No, don't do that.
No one would want that.

52:26.443 --> 52:28.378
Is... Is... uh...
Is that everything?

52:29.277 --> 52:32.512
Just to be clear,
land and exit the craft

52:32.514 --> 52:34.949
- with your hands high.
- Is... is... is Jen with you?

52:34.951 --> 52:36.818
Now, is that all
perfectly clear?

52:36.820 --> 52:39.456
Yes, perfectly fucking clear!
Is my wife with you?

52:40.556 --> 52:41.791
Of course.

52:42.557 --> 52:43.693
Is she safe?

52:44.393 --> 52:46.561
If you don't trust me
at this point, I'm afraid

52:46.563 --> 52:48.331
we won't be able
to continue business.

52:51.701 --> 52:52.601
Yep.

53:06.449 --> 53:07.384
Okay.

53:38.514 --> 53:40.715
That was really
fucking stupid, Haggerty.

53:40.717 --> 53:42.349
I have everything under control.

53:42.351 --> 53:43.885
I don't want you to have
everything under control.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.887
- That's my job.
- Jesus, stop thinking

53:45.889 --> 53:48.322
about your job
for one second of your life.

53:48.324 --> 53:49.791
Thinking
about my career is exactly

53:49.793 --> 53:51.795
why you're not in fucking prison
right now!

53:53.461 --> 53:56.398
What did I say when
we started down this path?

53:57.300 --> 53:59.434
- I don't know.
- I said

53:59.436 --> 54:01.869
you have to tell us where
your wife is at all times

54:01.871 --> 54:04.541
during this operation,
for her own safety.

54:21.958 --> 54:23.260
Tell me what you love
about your wife.

54:24.827 --> 54:26.661
God, why do you
need this from me?

54:26.663 --> 54:28.463
Why... why...
why are you doing this?

54:28.465 --> 54:30.500
What would you miss
most if she was gone?

54:30.733 --> 54:33.303
I... I can't think of anything
right now!

54:33.902 --> 54:35.869
What was she doing
at home?

54:35.871 --> 54:38.039
You said she was going
to Arkansas to visit her family.

54:38.041 --> 54:39.139
She's under enough stress.

54:39.141 --> 54:40.742
I didn't need
your trigger-finger cadets

54:40.744 --> 54:43.577
breathing down her neck when
she's not even involved in this.

54:43.579 --> 54:46.382
This part of my life
is over, okay? You said so.

54:47.483 --> 54:48.585
Jesus.

54:50.652 --> 54:52.388
She doesn't know about
any of this, does she?

54:55.958 --> 54:57.793
She knows that
I love her, I hope.

54:58.494 --> 55:00.561
She doesn't know
she has to close her life down

55:00.563 --> 55:02.331
in the morning and start
a new one.

55:03.532 --> 55:05.802
Well, don't worry too much.

55:06.568 --> 55:08.903
She'll probably leave you
when she finds out.

55:10.940 --> 55:13.106
Hey,
my love, just reminding you

55:13.108 --> 55:15.675
when you go to the grocery store
to please pick me up some milk.

55:15.677 --> 55:18.579
Sean, listen to me.

55:18.581 --> 55:20.815
...one percent, not two.
I can't deal with that stuff

55:20.817 --> 55:21.951
you drink. It's like...

55:22.585 --> 55:24.920
- Sean.
- No, I just... I...

55:25.820 --> 55:28.054
I mean, I would miss her.
I would miss

55:28.056 --> 55:29.825
everything about her. But I...

55:30.960 --> 55:33.094
I can't think
of anything specific.

55:33.096 --> 55:34.396
I know that's shit.

55:36.065 --> 55:38.068
I... I can't.

55:40.402 --> 55:42.004
Don't do this, Sean! Don't!

55:43.038 --> 55:46.009
I'm a shitty husband. God!

55:47.643 --> 55:49.709
Hey,
my love, just reminding you

55:49.711 --> 55:52.079
when you go to the grocery store
to please pick me up some milk.

55:52.081 --> 55:54.684
Don't do this!
Stop lying to me, please!

55:57.987 --> 56:00.590
We got a video.
The director got a video.

56:00.856 --> 56:02.359
I am so fucked.

56:02.657 --> 56:03.759
So?

56:04.860 --> 56:06.628
There was a man
at the airstrip,

56:07.463 --> 56:09.798
a Mexican federales
who was working for the cartel.

56:09.998 --> 56:11.634
He was about to start
working for us.

56:12.067 --> 56:13.836
He's the reason
you had that laptop.

56:15.838 --> 56:17.740
Octavio Hernandez.

56:19.742 --> 56:21.911
Cartel found out
he was playing both sides.

56:22.911 --> 56:24.747
Poured jet fuel down his throat.

56:25.748 --> 56:26.950
Threw a match on him.

56:28.851 --> 56:30.452
What? I...

56:34.889 --> 56:36.393
This is not my fault.

56:41.630 --> 56:43.133
Now, you listen to me.

56:43.965 --> 56:46.668
Can I... Can I... Can I talk
to her? Please!

56:48.103 --> 56:50.507
She don't wanna speak
to you right now, Sean.

56:58.112 --> 57:00.014
She's only
going to be safe once she's

57:00.016 --> 57:01.451
in a federal protection program.

57:01.916 --> 57:03.085
Hold the line.

57:05.554 --> 57:06.623
Oh, and eggs.

57:08.490 --> 57:10.193
And if you have time,

57:10.793 --> 57:12.860
uh, I guess I'm just asking you

57:12.862 --> 57:14.630
to make me some breakfast.

57:15.030 --> 57:18.001
Will you please make me
breakfast when you get home?

57:19.434 --> 57:21.869
Mexico just cleared
five simultaneous air strikes

57:21.871 --> 57:22.903
within their borders.

57:22.905 --> 57:24.271
That doesn't happen
if we don't get

57:24.273 --> 57:25.706
what's on that laptop.

57:25.708 --> 57:27.110
Air strike?
What are you talking...

57:27.775 --> 57:29.677
This is why they have Jen, okay?

57:29.679 --> 57:31.912
This operation,
this whole thing, it's too big.

57:31.914 --> 57:34.451
I would never have agreed
to this if I knew.

57:37.018 --> 57:38.754
Okay, can you just tell her

57:40.222 --> 57:42.625
what I meant when I said
I was done flying?

57:44.893 --> 57:45.794
What I...

57:48.097 --> 57:49.599
I meant that I'm done.

57:50.932 --> 57:53.066
I meant that I love her
and I am done

57:53.068 --> 57:56.604
hiding from her and us
and I am sorry and I love her.

57:56.606 --> 57:58.773
Please, please
tell her that, okay?

57:58.775 --> 58:00.775
Just... you don't have to do
anything else.

58:00.777 --> 58:01.978
Please tell her that.

58:08.016 --> 58:09.551
- I love you.
- No.

58:13.789 --> 58:14.691
No.

58:17.226 --> 58:18.760
Okay, fuck.

58:23.097 --> 58:24.965
You're only
a couple miles from the border,

58:24.967 --> 58:26.201
aren't you?

58:26.635 --> 58:29.769
Yeah, so, yeah, maybe, whatever.

58:29.771 --> 58:31.607
I mean, it's a big border,
Bloom.

58:31.907 --> 58:33.608
Yeah. You're right.

58:33.610 --> 58:34.878
I don't know exactly
where you are,

58:35.077 --> 58:36.644
but I do know you're well
within range

58:36.646 --> 58:38.281
of a U.S.
Border Patrol heliport.

58:39.014 --> 58:41.184
And that department owes me
a couple of favors.

58:42.184 --> 58:43.786
What? What?

58:45.054 --> 58:45.954
What?

59:00.802 --> 59:01.971
Don't do this, Bloom.

59:02.570 --> 59:04.706
I didn't do this.
You did.

59:07.675 --> 59:09.045
Do not do this, Bloom.

59:13.282 --> 59:15.251
Oh, shit!

59:20.989 --> 59:21.890
Bloom?

59:22.724 --> 59:24.192
Bloom! Shit!

59:27.262 --> 59:28.565
Goddamn it!

59:31.065 --> 59:32.234
Fuck!

59:33.702 --> 59:34.771
Come on!

59:41.342 --> 59:44.580
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

59:50.085 --> 59:50.987
Bloom!

59:57.326 --> 59:58.293
Oh, God.

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.038
Oh, no, no, no!

01:00:10.271 --> 01:00:11.974
No! No!

01:00:13.675 --> 01:00:16.011
Oh, God damn it, get over here!

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:40.834
Jesus! Jesus Christ!

01:00:40.836 --> 01:00:43.104
Come on! What the fuck?

01:00:45.273 --> 01:00:47.941
- Shit! Stop!
- Hello, this is Bloom.

01:00:47.943 --> 01:00:50.110
Bloom, they're going to drive me
straight into the ground!

01:00:50.112 --> 01:00:51.345
What are you
talking about?

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:52.780
They're shooting at me!

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:55.184
What? I told them no.
Hang on.

01:00:56.751 --> 01:00:58.452
- Hello, this is Bloom.
- Yeah, I know

01:00:58.454 --> 01:00:59.722
who the shit you are!

01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:02.090
Shut the fuck up, Sean.
I'm not talking to you.

01:01:02.423 --> 01:01:03.925
I'm talking to border patrol.

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:06.663
They're coming around.
Coming around again.

01:01:09.197 --> 01:01:12.766
Jesus, say it!
We are on the same side! Say it!

01:01:12.768 --> 01:01:15.003
They're patching me
through. Just hang on, Sean.

01:01:15.871 --> 01:01:18.838
Hello, yes? Yes, am I talking
directly to the pilot?

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.275
Oh, no, God!
This is not happening right now!

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:23.177
Okay, well tell your men
to stand down, I said

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.682
- I need that plane in one piece.
- Shit!

01:01:25.981 --> 01:01:27.283
Listen to him!

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:29.916
I said stand down!

01:01:29.918 --> 01:01:31.153
No deadly force.

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:35.222
Shit! Come on, Bloom,
repeat it, please.

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:37.427
Do not authorize
deadly force!

01:01:46.467 --> 01:01:50.070
Oh, no, what? No, no, no, no.

01:01:50.072 --> 01:01:51.774
No, not good,
not good, not good!

01:01:54.108 --> 01:01:56.011
No! Shit!

01:01:56.811 --> 01:01:58.748
Oh, come on!

01:02:03.518 --> 01:02:06.722
Okay, yes, I get it!
Everybody calm down!

01:02:11.393 --> 01:02:15.164
Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.

01:02:17.199 --> 01:02:18.300
Okay, easy.

01:02:19.034 --> 01:02:20.068
Okay.

01:02:22.237 --> 01:02:25.271
Okay. Wait a second,
how do I do this?

01:02:25.273 --> 01:02:27.442
Come on. Come on, come on.

01:02:37.518 --> 01:02:39.221
There are no vital signs.

01:02:40.355 --> 01:02:42.023
No. I don't understand.

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:46.459
I'm sorry,
but you have lost the child.

01:02:46.461 --> 01:02:47.262
What?

01:02:48.429 --> 01:02:50.098
I... I dont...

01:02:51.465 --> 01:02:53.235
There is something else,

01:02:53.802 --> 01:02:55.135
an irregularity.

01:02:55.137 --> 01:02:58.775
I... I was...

01:02:59.074 --> 01:03:01.844
We need to keep you
here for additional tests.

01:03:02.143 --> 01:03:03.512
What? Why?

01:03:10.418 --> 01:03:11.920
What did I do wrong?

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:15.057
Its not gonna...

01:03:16.257 --> 01:03:18.224
Its not your fault.

01:03:18.226 --> 01:03:20.193
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

01:03:20.195 --> 01:03:21.362
We did nothing wrong.

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:22.896
- I don't understand!
- No, no, no.

01:03:22.898 --> 01:03:25.666
- This is not us. It's not us.
- How do you know?

01:03:25.668 --> 01:03:27.236
It's just a fucking,
terrible thing...

01:03:28.003 --> 01:03:30.003
- that happened.
- It wasnt supposed

01:03:30.005 --> 01:03:31.473
to happen to us!

01:03:40.481 --> 01:03:42.083
Oh, dry. Fucking dry.

01:03:42.918 --> 01:03:43.820
Dry.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.360
Okay.

01:04:04.172 --> 01:04:06.106
Hey, my love,
just reminding you

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:08.878
when you go to the grocery store
to please pick me up some milk.

01:04:09.077 --> 01:04:10.413
I forgot it again.

01:04:11.246 --> 01:04:13.646
One percent, not two.
I can't deal with that stuff

01:04:13.648 --> 01:04:16.219
you drink.
It's, like, practically butter.

01:04:16.451 --> 01:04:17.552
Oh, and eggs.

01:04:18.619 --> 01:04:20.623
And if you have time,

01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:24.224
uh, I guess I'm just asking you
to make me some breakfast.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:28.163
Will you please make me
breakfast when you get home?

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:30.632
I love you.

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:48.217
Sean.

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:51.587
You have made
an unscheduled stop.

01:04:53.621 --> 01:04:54.522
Why?

01:04:56.925 --> 01:04:58.561
Uh, my fuel line was, um...

01:05:00.128 --> 01:05:01.998
What happened
to the fuel line?

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:04.432
Uh... it broke.

01:05:06.101 --> 01:05:08.267
The people above me
will insist

01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:10.405
on a very thorough report.

01:05:12.606 --> 01:05:15.177
Well, uh, tell them...

01:05:15.443 --> 01:05:19.079
tell them that
the fuel line was cracked,

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.349
and since I had to leave
without a pre-flight check,

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:23.351
I didn't have time to catch it.

01:05:24.152 --> 01:05:26.519
Is that what happened,
or are you just

01:05:26.521 --> 01:05:28.090
having me repeat a lie?

01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:31.927
You make reports
on all your kidnappings?

01:05:32.126 --> 01:05:35.229
Our employers are very thorough,

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.195
Mr. Haggerty.

01:05:36.197 --> 01:05:38.466
Yes. That is what happened.
And Mr. Mallory,

01:05:39.034 --> 01:05:41.304
my wife can never remember
the fucking milk.

01:05:41.702 --> 01:05:43.804
She always forgets it
cause it made her sick

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.405
when she was younger,
so they never had it

01:05:45.407 --> 01:05:46.308
in the house.

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.144
But ever since we got married,
she finds out that she loves it.

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:51.647
Only the one-percent,
though. She's...

01:05:52.313 --> 01:05:53.715
She's very specific about that.

01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:58.420
She needs me to get that for her
tomorrow morning.

01:06:01.088 --> 01:06:03.326
We'll be arriving
in 13 minutes.

01:06:04.025 --> 01:06:06.995
If you're not there
in 20 minutes, Jen dies.

01:06:07.429 --> 01:06:10.197
What? No. No, no, no.
No, no, I'll be there.

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:12.233
I must report
in 20 minutes.

01:06:12.567 --> 01:06:15.436
If our employer doesn't have
confirmation of your landing...

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:18.304
I will be... I will be there.
I swear. I swear to you.

01:06:18.306 --> 01:06:20.106
Mr. Mallory, I will be there.
You don't have to worry

01:06:20.108 --> 01:06:22.077
- about me, sir.
- If I have to kill Jen,

01:06:22.443 --> 01:06:25.347
she will have to be dissolved
in acid,

01:06:26.514 --> 01:06:29.282
because I can't guarantee
a precursor of a bullet.

01:06:29.284 --> 01:06:31.851
Please, you don't have to do
this. We will fuck off quietly.

01:06:31.853 --> 01:06:33.554
We will go quietly
out of your life.

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:34.822
Please,
you don't have to do this.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.557
Don't think
for a moment

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:38.425
that you are the only one
with something to lose

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:39.592
in 20 minutes.

01:06:39.594 --> 01:06:41.663
As I said,
our employer's thorough,

01:06:42.063 --> 01:06:43.597
punctual,
and viciously effective.

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:44.667
Now, that's a fact.

01:06:49.103 --> 01:06:51.239
Would you like to speak
with your wife again?

01:06:53.675 --> 01:06:55.244
Tell her I'll see her soon.

01:06:55.443 --> 01:06:57.146
Okay.

01:06:58.579 --> 01:06:59.514
Okay.

01:07:00.014 --> 01:07:01.150
Extra full.

01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:03.351
Flaps, 10 degrees.

01:07:25.239 --> 01:07:27.575
Come on, come on.
Faster, faster, faster.

01:07:30.378 --> 01:07:32.414
Fucking fall apart
in about 10 minutes.

01:07:33.414 --> 01:07:34.550
Jesus, come on.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.117
Oh!

01:07:36.717 --> 01:07:39.253
Okay, yeah, there we go.
There we go.

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:41.457
Come on. Baby, come on.

01:08:15.523 --> 01:08:16.791
All right, moving.

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:21.296
Clearing...

01:08:23.698 --> 01:08:26.202
should be...
should be right below.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.849
No. No.

01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:47.653
- Son of a bitch.
- Where are you?

01:08:47.654 --> 01:08:49.455
Staring down
at your fucking SUV.

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:50.691
Why are you doing this?

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:52.858
The director decided
you needed to be intercepted

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:54.327
- at all costs.
- They're going to kill her,

01:08:54.328 --> 01:08:56.330
Bloom! What part of that
don't you understand?

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.665
- Yeah. Sorry.
- How did you know?

01:08:58.667 --> 01:08:59.868
How'd you know
I was going to be here?

01:09:00.268 --> 01:09:03.139
Helicopter pilots.
They intercepted your heading.

01:09:03.604 --> 01:09:06.839
Wetlands were always
a candidate for a cartel drop.

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:08.474
Just needed someone to confirm.

01:09:08.475 --> 01:09:10.810
For the love of Christ, Bloom,
tell them to stand down

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:13.513
for like 10 minutes, okay?
They don't see the SUV yet,

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:15.014
- but if they do...
- It's out of my hands.

01:09:15.015 --> 01:09:16.318
Okay?

01:09:16.551 --> 01:09:18.417
Just get to Jen as fast
as you can.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.220
- She might have a shot.
- Asshole!

01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:25.792
Come on just... okay, just
fucking get there, Sean.

01:09:27.627 --> 01:09:28.928
Okay, come on,
you piece of shit.

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:31.232
You can outrun an SUV. Come on!

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:35.537
Four minutes.
Okay, come on, come on.

01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:37.907
That's where we are.

01:09:38.606 --> 01:09:41.577
Now, come on.
Let's hit that clearing.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.609
That's all you got to do.
There it is.

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:45.381
That's it. That's it.
Right there. Okay.

01:09:45.578 --> 01:09:48.448
Okay, we're coming in.
This is almost fucking over.

01:09:54.287 --> 01:09:55.455
Fucking...

01:09:58.027 --> 01:10:01.695
Uh, hey, Mallory, um,
I'm on my final approach.

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.530
Everything seems solid,
but I got to warn you

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:04.500
about something.

01:10:04.832 --> 01:10:07.334
Uh, there seems...
there's, like, a...

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.468
a park ranger, maybe,
or I don't know,

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:10.771
it could be border patrol.

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:12.641
Somebody's coming. Um...

01:10:12.974 --> 01:10:14.710
- Yeah, I just wanted to warn...
- Sean...

01:10:16.344 --> 01:10:18.447
- Jen?
- Sean!

01:10:19.346 --> 01:10:20.813
Okay, wait. Are you alone?

01:10:20.815 --> 01:10:22.251
Yes, I'm alone, but...

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.253
they're right... they're right
outside the door.

01:10:25.552 --> 01:10:28.423
- Jen, Jen, are you hurt?
- No.

01:10:28.989 --> 01:10:31.424
I'm okay, the ties are
a little tight, but I'm fine.

01:10:31.426 --> 01:10:32.627
- You're sure?
- Yes.

01:10:33.595 --> 01:10:35.461
Jen,
you cannot stay there.

01:10:35.463 --> 01:10:37.697
- They're gonna kill us.
- Just do what they say, Sean!

01:10:37.699 --> 01:10:39.066
No, that doesn't
matter anymore.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.567
They killed Octavio.

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:42.468
- Who's that?
- That doesn't matter either.

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:44.305
At this point, we-
we are gonna have to fight.

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:47.743
Okay. What do I do?

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:50.977
I don't know. Uh...

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:54.513
Look in the car, there anything,
did they leave like a weapon

01:10:54.515 --> 01:10:55.615
a gun or a knife?

01:10:58.686 --> 01:11:00.288
Okay. Okay.

01:11:04.559 --> 01:11:06.026
No, they took everything.

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:07.994
Okay, they took everything.
They took everything.

01:11:07.996 --> 01:11:10.129
- What do we need to do?
- Sean!

01:11:10.131 --> 01:11:12.465
Okay, I'm thinking.
Let me think for a second.

01:11:12.467 --> 01:11:14.403
Shh! Shh!
Stop thinking out loud.

01:11:14.802 --> 01:11:17.070
Okay. Sorry. Um...

01:11:18.439 --> 01:11:20.775
What about the keys?
Did they leave the keys?

01:11:21.408 --> 01:11:22.877
No, they didn't leave
the fucking keys!

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:28.815
Uh, a screwdriver,
I mean, literally anything, Jen.

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.717
Look around the car.
Search the glove box.

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:32.788
- Can you get in there?
- Okay.

01:11:33.688 --> 01:11:35.490
Anything to break
into the ignition.

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:40.828
What? I can't hear you.

01:11:41.029 --> 01:11:43.028
Okay, Jen, there's
got to be something...

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:44.998
No, they didn't leave
anything, Sean.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.400
I can't do it!

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:48.871
It's not impossible. You
need to keep trying.

01:11:59.646 --> 01:12:01.649
Where are you, Sean?

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.086
Where are you?

01:12:04.551 --> 01:12:05.919
Jen...

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:08.687
You're gonna get better.
I'm going to make sure of that.

01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:10.625
So please, please, please...

01:12:13.795 --> 01:12:16.532
Okay. Okay.

01:12:22.670 --> 01:12:24.340
Goddamn it, come on, Jen!

01:12:25.707 --> 01:12:26.842
There he is.

01:12:27.475 --> 01:12:28.844
- Mallory...
- Not yet.

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:32.512
I don't know. I mean, I just...
I don't fucking know.

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:35.080
Come on, there's got to be...
I don't know.

01:12:35.082 --> 01:12:38.119
I don't fucking know.
There's gotta be something.

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:44.659
Okay, I'll try.

01:12:45.793 --> 01:12:47.028
I'll try.

01:12:51.432 --> 01:12:52.134
Oh.

01:12:53.568 --> 01:12:54.470
What?

01:12:57.137 --> 01:12:59.140
What? Jen, talk to me.

01:13:01.475 --> 01:13:03.378
- Jen?
- I found the keys.

01:13:05.979 --> 01:13:08.884
Shit! Really? That's fantastic.
Okay, hurry! Come on!

01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:14.155
Shit, start the car!
Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:13:14.622 --> 01:13:15.758
Flare.

01:13:24.498 --> 01:13:26.066
Jen, just start the car.

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.134
You try starting a car
with your hands tied!

01:13:28.136 --> 01:13:31.036
Okay, I know.
I know it's hard, but just...

01:13:31.038 --> 01:13:33.205
you gotta focus,
you've got to do this, Jen.

01:13:38.813 --> 01:13:40.716
Uh, okay. okay. Uh...

01:13:42.716 --> 01:13:43.918
Shit, shit!

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:47.586
Okay, uh, Jen, just you get
that thing started,

01:13:47.588 --> 01:13:49.425
and I think I can handle
these guys.

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:09.711
Damn it!

01:14:10.144 --> 01:14:13.081
- Okay, how you doin', Jen?
- Stupid thing won't...

01:14:16.551 --> 01:14:19.188
What the fuck? Get ready!

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.955
- Okay, I got it, I got it.
- Yes!

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:23.790
Go, go, go, Jen! Go!

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:31.164
Come on, Jen! Keep going!

01:14:34.801 --> 01:14:36.003
Are you okay?

01:14:36.904 --> 01:14:39.839
- They shot out the tire!
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:14:39.841 --> 01:14:41.710
Shoot! Shoot,
shoot, shoot!

01:14:43.211 --> 01:14:45.946
- What? What's going on?
- Nothing. It's fine.

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:48.050
Uh, no, it's all okay.
I just, uh,

01:14:48.882 --> 01:14:51.019
need to figure out
where to land.

01:14:56.990 --> 01:15:00.028
No matter what happens,
you don't stop driving.

01:15:05.632 --> 01:15:06.868
Just keep driving.

01:15:07.835 --> 01:15:09.971
Don't stop driving, Jen,
no matter what.

01:15:18.279 --> 01:15:19.581
I'm sorry.

01:15:44.037 --> 01:15:45.172
Sean!

01:15:47.675 --> 01:15:48.844
Sean! Sean!

01:15:53.881 --> 01:15:54.981
Sean!

01:15:56.751 --> 01:15:57.985
Are you okay?

01:16:04.891 --> 01:16:06.692
I got you. I got you.

01:16:06.694 --> 01:16:07.962
- Okay.
- Go. Go.

01:17:25.338 --> 01:17:27.876
Get on the ground!

01:17:28.141 --> 01:17:29.277
They got 'em.

01:17:32.646 --> 01:17:34.716
- On the ground. Now!
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:37.317
- Stay on the ground.
- Lay down. It's okay.

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:38.754
Show me your hands!

01:17:44.057 --> 01:17:46.459
- We got 'em.
- It's okay.

01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:49.765
Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:55.203
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:57.972
Come on. Run! Run!

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.930
Stay here.

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:10.872
Okay. Okay.

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:02.556
Jen! No! Jen!

01:21:30.083 --> 01:21:31.118
It's over!

01:23:19.126 --> 01:23:20.195
