28:24.872 --> 28:25.774
Is it true?

28:29.877 --> 28:33.047
Well, for starters,

28:35.449 --> 28:38.152
I thought I had
a kid.

28:38.552 --> 28:41.488
Shit I thought I was in love too

28:41.588 --> 28:44.458
but come to find out she lied to
me.

28:47.461 --> 28:49.764
Had an affair with my brother

28:53.133 --> 28:56.671
and I've just never
been so hurt in my life.

28:56.805 --> 28:57.938
I just lost it.

29:02.843 --> 29:07.281
But I never meant to hurt
anyone, honestly, but I did.

29:11.485 --> 29:14.855
I mean as long as you
learn from the situation,

29:14.988 --> 29:18.158
that's all you can take from it,
right?

29:18.492 --> 29:22.329
I mean, that's all I can
do at this point, you know?

29:23.497 --> 29:26.867
But tell me more about yourself
Miss Keke.

29:29.269 --> 29:31.138
Where do I start?

29:31.205 --> 29:34.508
Okay, well,

29:36.176 --> 29:37.846
I'm an only child.

29:38.011 --> 29:38.713
Oh wow.

29:38.847 --> 29:39.714
Oh, yeah.

29:40.849 --> 29:43.651
I lost my parents about a year
ago.

29:44.686 --> 29:48.656
My mother she had cancer and my
father,

29:48.723 --> 29:52.292
we like to say that he
died of a broken heart.

29:55.462 --> 29:58.565
Just explains why I don't love.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.234
Damn, that's deep.

30:02.704 --> 30:06.206
I guess love does make us
do some crazy shit, man.

30:06.306 --> 30:09.209
Mm, I guess you would know,

31:57.417 --> 31:58.585

31:58.653 --> 32:02.657
Your probation officer, Mr
Aries, was looking for you.

32:03.190 --> 32:04.591
Mr Aries was here?

32:04.659 --> 32:06.527

43:27.942 --> 43:28.943

File says he's kind of
a big deal around here.

43:33.047 --> 43:35.650
Yeah, I guess he's

43:35.716 --> 43:37.551

I say let 'em have it.

43:44.858 --> 43:46.026
Just hear me out.

43:46.126 --> 43:47.861
Why waste time putting good cops
out there

43:47.962 --> 43:50.864
just to be caught In the cross
fire.

43:50.965 --> 43:52.499
I mean, we're tryna clean up
something

43:52.566 --> 43:55.002
that don't wanna be cleaned.

43:55.069 --> 43:56.804
I see what you're saying,
I mean I was right there

43:56.870 --> 43:58.372
with you up until the end.

43:58.472 --> 44:02.076
But I wouldn't even
entertain an idea like that.

44:02.209 --> 44:04.912
See, you didn't grow up
on this side of the track.

44:05.045 --> 44:06.747
I was here, being pushed around

44:06.880 --> 44:08.349
by that motherfucker as a kid

44:08.415 --> 44:10.818
and a few others just like him.

44:10.884 --> 44:13.420
I didn't have a older
brother to protect me.

44:13.554 --> 44:15.889
All I had was my dad.

44:15.956 --> 44:18.826
My father loved this place.

44:18.892 --> 44:22.930
He was a youth coach and a model
citizen for this community.

44:23.063 --> 44:25.199
And you know what happened?

44:26.567 --> 44:29.903
One day we was walking to the
car after basketball practice

44:30.004 --> 44:34.108
and one of the very kids that
he coached tried to rob him,

44:34.241 --> 44:36.543
killed him all of 40 dollars.

44:38.112 --> 44:39.013
Sorry to hear that.

44:39.079 --> 44:40.848
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

44:41.849 --> 44:42.916
Sorry I don't look out this
window

44:43.017 --> 44:44.785
and see hope for this place

44:44.918 --> 44:48.188
until assholes like that
are off the streets.

44:49.456 --> 44:51.358
One way or another.

44:51.425 --> 44:53.227
I think we should pay a
visit to Mr Nicholas Heirs

44:53.294 --> 44:55.963
before we speak to Mr Williams.

44:56.096 --> 44:56.964
Agreed.

45:16.150 --> 45:17.418
Yo, Kevvy Kev.

45:44.978 --> 45:46.280
I don't do that.

45:46.347 --> 45:48.082
You don't do what?

45:48.148 --> 45:50.317

45:51.352 --> 45:53.487
Let me find out you soft like

45:54.988 --> 45:57.091

45:57.157 --> 45:58.459
Better calm down before
you get your ass beat

45:58.525 --> 46:00.160
like your pops just did.

46:02.363 --> 46:04.531
Oh what, you don't know?

46:04.666 --> 46:05.633
What kind of world we living

jail

46:06.867 --> 46:07.802

boy.

46:07.868 --> 46:08.969
That ain't my dad.

46:09.036 --> 46:10.437
His mother sure know how
to keep it in the family.

46:10.504 --> 46:11.806

46:11.872 --> 46:13.340

46:13.440 --> 46:16.510
I'll fucking give you a
bandaid or some shit like that.

46:16.611 --> 46:18.445
I ain't fucking with babies and
shit.

46:20.782 --> 46:22.883
Have you seen Kevin?

46:23.016 --> 46:24.118
I don't know what to tell you,

46:24.184 --> 46:25.185
he don't listen to me.

46:25.285 --> 46:26.520
I'm worried about this boy.

46:30.457 --> 46:33.862
Mm, just talk to him.

46:37.632 --> 46:39.133

46:39.199 --> 46:40.134

46:45.874 --> 46:47.074

46:49.209 --> 46:51.211
and you continue to disobey me.

46:51.311 --> 46:53.981

46:54.047 --> 46:56.316

we're worried about you Kevin.

47:01.054 --> 47:03.257

yourself?

47:03.357 --> 47:05.392
What you want me to say?

47:06.493 --> 47:10.665
Boy, go to your room and don't
come out.

47:10.732 --> 47:12.232
Man, you ain't my mother.

47:12.332 --> 47:14.435
You damn sure ain't my father.

47:14.568 --> 47:17.337
Keep tryna tell me what

your girlfriends place.

47:46.634 --> 47:48.202

48:10.658 --> 48:13.761

49:27.401 --> 49:30.404
Oh, you on the phone,
you talking to Rosalyn?

49:30.537 --> 49:31.906
Nah, that's lil' Kevin.

49:32.040 --> 49:35.208
You know, he always call
me to tell me good night.

49:37.045 --> 49:38.012
You know I've known you

49:38.078 --> 49:40.247
and Rosalyn practically all my
life

49:40.380 --> 49:42.349
and I'd never lie to you.

49:43.818 --> 49:46.386
You drunk, like what is you
getting at?

49:49.323 --> 49:52.492
Will told me that lil'
Kevin might not even be yours.

49:55.495 --> 49:56.496
Sarah, if you don't get your
drunk ass

49:56.563 --> 49:58.231
the fuck out of here.

49:59.566 --> 50:01.401
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

50:02.604 --> 50:05.105
Come up here talking that
bullshit!

50:05.238 --> 50:07.207
You should ask her Nic.

50:12.747 --> 50:14.181
Vindicator
One, this is Launch Control,

50:14.247 --> 50:16.951
please advise for street wide
check.

50:25.425 --> 50:27.461
Standing by to engage primary
ignition.

50:27.594 --> 50:29.864
Oh, we have an audio message.

50:31.032 --> 50:33.935
This
is space outpost nine,

50:34.035 --> 50:36.938
no enemy activity in this area.

50:37.038 --> 50:38.906
Thank you nine.

50:38.973 --> 50:40.407
Control to Vindicator One,

50:40.474 --> 50:43.443
maintain radio silence until
mission.

50:46.213 --> 50:47.615
Ros.

50:47.715 --> 50:49.951
I don't know why she would say
that.

50:50.051 --> 50:51.919
Why would she say that?

50:51.986 --> 50:53.587
Again Nic, really?

50:54.722 --> 50:55.657
Sarah's never lied to me
before,

50:55.790 --> 50:56.490
why would she say that?

50:56.624 --> 50:57.725
Sarah's a drunk!

50:57.792 --> 50:59.627
Don't listen to her.

50:59.727 --> 51:02.664
But why would she say that
Rosalyn?

51:02.797 --> 51:04.431
Tell me something.

51:04.498 --> 51:05.599
Say something.

51:11.571 --> 51:12.907
Nic, I'm sorry.

51:14.842 --> 51:16.010
You're sorry.

51:17.078 --> 51:18.646
What does that mean?

51:20.347 --> 51:21.783
What are you tryna tell me?

51:21.849 --> 51:23.685
That's not my fucking son?

51:23.818 --> 51:26.821
Is that what you're telling me?

51:26.921 --> 51:28.255
Nic, I'm sorry.

51:29.824 --> 51:31.993
I can't fucking believe you.

51:37.364 --> 51:39.834
Who's fucking son is it, hah?

51:41.936 --> 51:43.503
Who's is it Rosalyn?

51:54.682 --> 51:55.717
It's Will's.

51:57.952 --> 51:59.319
My fucking brother?

51:59.386 --> 52:00.320
No, no!

53:23.938 --> 53:24.972
Hey guys, right on time.

53:25.106 --> 53:26.040
What do we got?

53:26.107 --> 53:27.074
From the looks of it,

53:27.141 --> 53:28.609
they must have really pissed
somebody off.

53:28.709 --> 53:29.944
In the blood he was stabbed four
times

53:30.044 --> 53:33.614
and as for they guy, you
better look for yourselves.

53:34.115 --> 53:36.651
It seems like the perp
came through the back door.

53:42.723 --> 53:44.625
Let me show you the shit
upstairs.

54:09.650 --> 54:12.620
Look at you, you sick
motherfucker.

54:13.821 --> 54:16.090
I told you I was gon' get your
ass.

54:16.157 --> 54:19.660
One way or another, or
somebody else would.

54:23.097 --> 54:27.335
He got your ass good
too, all dead and shit.

54:46.519 --> 54:47.454
Hey!

54:48.356 --> 54:49.323
You want something?

54:49.389 --> 54:51.025
I need to know what I just
witnessed.

54:51.125 --> 54:52.059
Witnessed?

54:52.193 --> 54:53.728
Are you implying something
Hanna?

54:53.861 --> 54:55.329
I need to know what you said
in there.

54:55.395 --> 54:56.496
Are you questioning me?

54:56.563 --> 54:57.899
I'm asking.

54:58.032 --> 54:59.000
And so am I.

54:59.066 --> 55:01.202
Are you questioning me
detective?

55:02.870 --> 55:04.171
Hey Ferguson.

55:04.238 --> 55:05.740
Give me a minute.

55:08.643 --> 55:10.311
I said give me one minute.

55:21.822 --> 55:23.324
I don't know why you talk so
much shit.

55:23.391 --> 55:24.659
I'm tired of winning on this
table.

55:24.725 --> 55:26.260
They gon' call this Duane's
table.

55:26.394 --> 55:29.163
Now you know I'm letting you
win 'cause you an old man.

55:29.230 --> 55:31.999
You know what, I like that.

55:32.066 --> 55:34.501
Every 31st I'ma gon'
let this be Duane's bar,

55:34.567 --> 55:35.736
I'ma let you handle mortgage.

55:35.836 --> 55:38.072
That'll be my gift to
you 'cause I love you.

55:38.172 --> 55:39.407
I love you Duane.

55:39.506 --> 55:40.374
Mark I love you like a
brother,

55:40.440 --> 55:41.842
but I don't want the headache of
this bar.

55:41.909 --> 55:42.677
Haha.

55:42.743 --> 55:43.678
Eight ball off your break.

55:45.246 --> 55:48.849
You ain't knocked down
a single ball old man.

55:48.916 --> 55:51.352
Look like it's all me from here.

55:51.419 --> 55:53.688
So what's going on fellas?

55:55.289 --> 55:56.090
What's up Mark?

55:56.190 --> 55:58.859
Will, long time no see.

55:59.927 --> 56:01.528
What brings you up here?

56:01.594 --> 56:03.130
Oh man what, I gotta have an
invite

56:03.264 --> 56:05.800
to come check out my family
business, man?

56:05.933 --> 56:07.567
Come on man, I just wanted to
stop by,

56:07.635 --> 56:09.136
see how everybody's doing.

56:09.270 --> 56:11.405
Everybody's good, thank you.

56:11.471 --> 56:12.707
Okay, so I hear Nic's home.

56:12.773 --> 56:14.141
Yep.

56:14.275 --> 56:16.277
So, what you got him
back up here working?

56:16.377 --> 56:17.278
Yeah.

56:19.880 --> 56:20.948
He here now?

56:26.153 --> 56:27.989
Will, if you don't
get your ass outta here.

56:28.122 --> 56:30.091
Damn man, I can't come see my
brother?

56:30.157 --> 56:31.792
You can see him whenever
you want,

56:32.293 --> 56:33.394
just not here.

56:33.461 --> 56:35.463
Yo Will, yo Will!

56:35.796 --> 56:36.964
I put up with this shit all day
at work

56:37.098 --> 56:39.100
I ain't putting up with it
here, take it somewheres else.

56:39.166 --> 56:42.636
Listen man, you know
what, my bad Mr officer.

56:43.570 --> 56:46.173
Man, remember who taught you
how to play the game, boy.

56:47.975 --> 56:49.143
Everybody wanna be a gangster

56:49.243 --> 56:51.746
until it's time to do gangster
shit.

56:52.480 --> 56:53.513
I can't even imagine
what he was drinking.

56:53.981 --> 56:54.682
Hey Fitz.

56:54.749 --> 56:55.316
Hey.

56:55.416 --> 56:57.485
Stacey, is the captain in?

56:57.584 --> 56:58.986
Yes, she's in her office, go
ahead in.

56:59.086 --> 56:59.954
Okay, great thanks.

57:00.021 --> 57:01.022
Mm-hm, no problem.

57:01.489 --> 57:03.324
I don't know if it was a
mixture of tequila or wine

57:03.424 --> 57:04.492
or some sorta...

57:07.495 --> 57:09.096
Cap, you busy?

57:09.596 --> 57:11.932
Not any more, come in
detective.

57:14.368 --> 57:15.436
You wanna sit?

57:15.503 --> 57:16.504
Right, yes.

57:18.005 --> 57:20.141
I don't have all morning
Fitzgerald.

57:20.374 --> 57:22.943
Right yes, I just wanted to,

57:23.010 --> 57:25.346
I just wanna talk about
Ferguson, if that's okay?

57:25.446 --> 57:26.614
What about him?

57:26.881 --> 57:28.449
Well I think he...

57:28.548 --> 57:30.351
Just running a little late.

57:31.185 --> 57:33.387
Sorry 'bout that, good
morning, Cap.

57:34.188 --> 57:35.623
Good morning.

57:36.123 --> 57:37.191
What's the report on Williams?

57:37.291 --> 57:39.727
Multiple stab wounds
to the chest and back,

57:39.860 --> 57:43.531
close range gun shot to the
head, this was pretty personal.

57:44.865 --> 57:45.733
Any leads?

57:45.866 --> 57:46.634
Well there is just this one.

57:46.700 --> 57:47.701
Nope.

57:47.802 --> 57:49.503
The scene was pretty
cut and dry, literally.

57:49.569 --> 57:50.805
But wasn't there just this...

57:50.871 --> 57:53.507
A bunch of false leads,
a recants of statements,

57:53.573 --> 57:55.142
yep, sure was.

57:55.209 --> 57:56.377
Cap, I think in interest of
justice,

57:56.477 --> 57:58.312
we should pursue all leads and
reexamine

57:58.379 --> 58:00.247
any possible evidence.

58:00.648 --> 58:03.250
I would hope so,
that's kind of your job.

58:03.384 --> 58:06.387
This could have literally
been anybody but what do I know,

58:06.487 --> 58:08.089
you the boss right?

58:08.588 --> 58:11.058
Right, Hanna, weren't
you saying something

58:11.125 --> 58:12.927
before Casey walked in?

58:14.228 --> 58:15.595
Well I just wanted to make
sure

58:15.729 --> 58:18.365
he made the briefing, that's
all.

58:27.842 --> 58:29.877
Hey Fitz, what the
hell was that back there?

58:29.944 --> 58:31.545
You tell me, the way I see it

58:31.612 --> 58:33.080
I'm an accessory to a cover up

58:33.180 --> 58:36.016
and I definitely didn't sign up
for that.

58:36.083 --> 58:37.551
You wanna go on like you don't
believe

58:37.618 --> 58:40.921
Mr Heirs has anything to
do with this, be my guest.

58:41.021 --> 58:44.191
I'm gonna find him with or
without you.

59:07.648 --> 59:08.482
what are you doing?

59:08.617 --> 59:09.483
Drive.

59:11.152 --> 59:11.919
What...

59:11.986 --> 59:12.987
Just drive.

59:29.503 --> 59:30.804
Ah, thank you, thank you.

59:30.905 --> 59:31.805
Can I get you anything else?

59:31.906 --> 59:32.806
Nah I'm good, I'm good.

59:32.907 --> 59:33.642
Okay, enjoy.

59:33.741 --> 59:34.643
All right.

59:36.477 --> 59:37.244
- Hello.
- Hi.

59:37.311 --> 59:38.078
How are you?

59:43.584 --> 59:44.919
Can I help y'all?

59:44.985 --> 59:46.120
We hoping you could.

59:46.187 --> 59:47.188
You see my partner and I are
investigating

59:47.321 --> 59:49.523
the murder of Latol Williams.

59:49.658 --> 59:50.524
Who?

59:53.527 --> 59:54.461
Smack.

01:00:02.369 --> 01:00:03.304
And?

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.509
What he gotta do with me?

01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:09.510
Well we know about the
incident

01:00:09.611 --> 01:00:11.545
that happened at the bar the
other night.

01:00:12.012 --> 01:00:16.050
I heard about it but
fuck that gotta do with me?

01:00:16.951 --> 01:00:19.954
Where were you at
Tuesday night, at 2 a.m.?

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.322
I was home asleep.

01:00:21.388 --> 01:00:22.723
Can anyone verify that?

01:00:22.856 --> 01:00:24.491
Yeah, my girl Keke.

01:00:27.728 --> 01:00:31.031
Look Nic, you were always a
smart guy,

01:00:31.131 --> 01:00:33.867
so you should know we're gona
figure this out either way

01:00:33.968 --> 01:00:35.869
and by some fucking chance I

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.871

01:00:37.972 --> 01:00:41.542
well, this will be the last
time you get to enjoy a meal

01:00:41.643 --> 01:00:43.077
as good as this.

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:44.578
Have a nice day.

01:00:46.013 --> 01:00:50.351
Oh, by the way, try their
potato salad, it's delicious.

01:00:56.658 --> 01:00:59.059
There's gotta be at
least six homeless people

01:00:59.159 --> 01:01:01.328
missing a hat like that
at least six.

01:01:01.395 --> 01:01:04.031
Okay, okay, we roasting, we
roasting?

01:01:04.098 --> 01:01:04.865
Are you ready?

01:01:04.932 --> 01:01:05.700
I'm just telling you facts.

01:01:05.766 --> 01:01:06.533
Are you ready?

01:01:06.601 --> 01:01:07.568
Are you ready officer?

01:01:07.669 --> 01:01:08.402

01:01:08.502 --> 01:01:09.236
Are you ready officer?

01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:11.005
Yeah I'm ready.

01:01:11.071 --> 01:01:12.172
He brought his A-game.

01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:13.440
He gon' nasty.

01:01:15.576 --> 01:01:17.511
Don't make me come around
there and kick your ass.

01:01:17.911 --> 01:01:20.180
Motherfucker you, you
motherfucker you.

01:01:20.247 --> 01:01:21.348
Mark!

01:01:22.516 --> 01:01:24.251
I need to talk to you, man.

01:01:24.285 --> 01:01:25.352
I'll talk to you in
the kitchen.

01:01:27.087 --> 01:01:27.921
Mark?

01:01:28.022 --> 01:01:30.759
I'll talk to you in the
kitchen.

01:01:39.533 --> 01:01:41.603
You better drink something.

01:01:52.446 --> 01:01:53.748
What's happening?

01:01:58.787 --> 01:02:01.623
After what happened,
I just wanted to know

01:02:01.723 --> 01:02:03.891
if I still have my job?

01:02:03.957 --> 01:02:04.892
A job?

01:02:05.993 --> 01:02:08.797
Yes. Out there? No.

01:02:10.064 --> 01:02:14.101
I can't have you out on
the floor, all scarred up.

01:02:17.504 --> 01:02:21.075
Come on Mark, man, I'm your
best fucking bartender, man.

01:02:21.141 --> 01:02:24.612
It might be well and fine and
true

01:02:24.679 --> 01:02:26.914
but be it that this is a
business,

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.948
we're gonna conduct business

01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:29.950
and this is how we're gonna do
it.

01:02:30.017 --> 01:02:32.353
I'ma have you back here for a
little bit,

01:02:32.486 --> 01:02:35.956
you just give it some
time that you heal up

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:39.526
then we go from there all right?

01:02:41.028 --> 01:02:42.162
All right?

01:02:44.498 --> 01:02:45.265
All right.

01:02:45.332 --> 01:02:46.266
Aight.

01:02:48.869 --> 01:02:53.006
Aight, I need to get back
out here with my customers.

01:02:53.107 --> 01:02:57.111
Hey, you don't think I
look homeless in this hat?

01:03:09.356 --> 01:03:11.225
You've been here a week,

01:03:11.358 --> 01:03:14.027
I've been doing this for two
years.

01:03:22.804 --> 01:03:25.239
I can't take no more of this.

01:03:27.908 --> 01:03:28.909
Yo, Mark.

01:03:29.042 --> 01:03:31.378
Ay, you see the napkins
that I put in here?

01:03:31.478 --> 01:03:32.379
Nah.

01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:37.918
Ay, yo, you got my check from
last week?

01:03:38.051 --> 01:03:39.888
If it's anywhere, it's in my
office

01:03:39.987 --> 01:03:43.190
go in there and look on my desk.

01:03:43.257 --> 01:03:45.058
You know what?

01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:46.493
Fuck this shit.

01:04:25.098 --> 01:04:26.033
Fuck!

01:04:28.101 --> 01:04:29.771
Ay, you can't be arguing with
everybody.

01:04:29.804 --> 01:04:31.773
Remember what happening last
week?

01:04:31.873 --> 01:04:34.107
Hey, did you get your check?

01:04:35.944 --> 01:04:36.778
Yo, what the fuck?

01:04:36.878 --> 01:04:37.645
Nic, is you crazy?

01:04:37.779 --> 01:04:38.746
Yo, yo, fuck.

01:04:40.782 --> 01:04:43.050
No, no, let him go.

01:04:43.116 --> 01:04:45.452
Why you aint tell me
you fucked Keke, hah?

01:04:45.552 --> 01:04:47.287
Fucked a lot of bitches
when you was locked up.

01:04:47.387 --> 01:04:48.121
When was you gonna tell me?

01:04:48.222 --> 01:04:49.657
When we got married?

01:04:49.791 --> 01:04:53.126
I thought you was tryna bust
a nut, not start a family.

01:04:53.227 --> 01:04:54.461
You know what, you just like
the rest

01:04:54.561 --> 01:04:56.430
of this fucked up family.

01:04:56.497 --> 01:04:58.098
Fuck you!

01:04:58.165 --> 01:05:00.100
Do that one more time.

01:05:03.504 --> 01:05:04.839
Yo, this shit...

01:05:06.674 --> 01:05:08.442
Will, fuck you, man!

01:05:24.091 --> 01:05:27.762
Oh shit, you scared the shit
out of me.

01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:28.763
Hey babe.

01:05:30.197 --> 01:05:33.768
Why you aint tell me you
fucked Mark?

01:05:33.835 --> 01:05:34.769
What?

01:05:34.869 --> 01:05:37.170
Oh, you thought I
wasn't gon' find out, huh?

01:05:37.939 --> 01:05:41.208
Nigger, you better back
the fuck up, I am not her.

01:05:41.341 --> 01:05:43.544
Oh, so what, you gon' cut me
now?

01:05:43.678 --> 01:05:46.014
I mean, if y'all had something
going on,

01:05:46.113 --> 01:05:49.182
why the fuck did nobody tell me?

01:05:49.283 --> 01:05:51.552
Nic, there is nothing to tell.

01:05:51.686 --> 01:05:55.522
This was way before I even
knew anything about you.

01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:58.358
So why didn't nobody tell me?

01:05:59.861 --> 01:06:01.696
Why would I risk everything

01:06:01.796 --> 01:06:05.065
to tell you something
that don't even matter?

01:06:05.566 --> 01:06:07.367
What would make you think

01:06:07.467 --> 01:06:10.972
fucking my cousin doesn't
matter?

01:06:11.039 --> 01:06:14.308
Why would fucking my cousin, not
matter?

01:06:21.148 --> 01:06:24.084
Remember when you told me
everything that happened to you?

01:06:24.217 --> 01:06:28.088
Now you gonna sit here
and judge me for my past?

01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:32.827
You're a fucking hypocrite.

01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:38.766
You know what, you right

01:06:41.234 --> 01:06:44.072
and you can have all this shit
too.

01:06:46.239 --> 01:06:50.078
Nic, just let me explain.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.115
Nah, you said enough.

01:06:57.417 --> 01:06:58.285
Nic!

01:07:00.622 --> 01:07:01.555
Nic!

01:07:20.273 --> 01:07:22.209
See your I.D.?

01:07:22.275 --> 01:07:24.045
What's good big bro?

01:07:27.715 --> 01:07:29.651
Yeah, man, you banned from
here man.

01:07:29.784 --> 01:07:32.486
Banned, bro, like, come no
man, gotta be a mistake brah.

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:33.487
I come here all the time, man.

01:07:33.553 --> 01:07:34.756
I can't do nothing for you,
man.

01:07:34.822 --> 01:07:37.091
No, I'm just here to see Nic,
man.

01:07:37.157 --> 01:07:38.492
I'll let him know.

01:07:38.626 --> 01:07:40.962
I aint ask you motherfucker,
man.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.123
Yo, where you at bro?

01:08:10.524 --> 01:08:11.926
Yeah, I think he got something
to do

01:08:11.993 --> 01:08:13.928
with Smack getting killed.

01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:16.430
I'm not leaving here
until the bar let out.

01:08:16.496 --> 01:08:17.596
Just get here.

01:08:26.674 --> 01:08:27.841
Man it's freezing out here.

01:08:27.942 --> 01:08:30.277
You a cop, you never get
cold, you never get hungry,

01:08:30.343 --> 01:08:32.846
you never get tired, remember
that.

01:08:32.947 --> 01:08:34.182
Hey detective.

01:08:34.281 --> 01:08:37.018
I hope you got some rest,
it's gonna be a long night.

01:08:37.118 --> 01:08:38.218
What we got?

01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:42.790
The victim name is Glen
Perkens, also known as Trick,

01:08:42.857 --> 01:08:44.524
one of Smack's boys.

01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:45.660
Any witnesses?

01:08:45.727 --> 01:08:46.694
Nope.

01:08:46.828 --> 01:08:48.196
Have you talked to the
owner of the bar yet?

01:08:48.295 --> 01:08:50.198
I was waiting for you.

01:08:52.966 --> 01:08:54.468
What's going on yo?

01:08:54.533 --> 01:08:56.569
That's Trick, yo Trick!

01:08:56.703 --> 01:08:57.839
Nah, that's my brother!

01:08:57.904 --> 01:08:59.640
That my fucking brother, man!

01:08:59.707 --> 01:09:00.640
Yo, Trick!

01:09:03.077 --> 01:09:06.580
Excuse me, we're looking
for a Mister Mark Toomer.

01:09:06.714 --> 01:09:08.515
Yeah, that's me.

01:09:08.582 --> 01:09:12.319
I told the first officer,
kid tried to come in here

01:09:12.385 --> 01:09:13.921
but his banned from this bar.

01:09:14.055 --> 01:09:15.388
Why is that?

01:09:15.488 --> 01:09:19.060
He came here a few weeks
ago with some of his friends

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.162
and started a fight with my
cousin.

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:22.162
Nic?

01:09:23.231 --> 01:09:23.930
Yeah.

01:09:24.232 --> 01:09:25.398
Is Nic here, we'd
like to speak with him.

01:09:25.532 --> 01:09:28.069
The motherfucker ain't here.

01:09:28.202 --> 01:09:32.506
We got into some shit
earlier over a barmaid

01:09:32.572 --> 01:09:33.741
that works here.

01:09:33.841 --> 01:09:35.243
Keke?

01:09:35.341 --> 01:09:36.911
Yeah.

01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:39.714
Do you know if that's where he
went?

01:09:39.781 --> 01:09:41.348
I don't know where he went

01:09:41.413 --> 01:09:44.584
but if I had a guess.

01:09:46.687 --> 01:09:47.755
Yeah.

01:09:48.455 --> 01:09:52.225
Thank you Mr Toomer,
we'll be in touch soon.

01:09:57.932 --> 01:09:58.866
Oh shit.

01:10:03.137 --> 01:10:04.972
Captian, we're just...

01:10:06.406 --> 01:10:08.609
I don't like getting phone
calls about work, after work.

01:10:08.743 --> 01:10:11.712
Especially if it's about
a murder in this town

01:10:11.779 --> 01:10:14.215
and what bothers me the most
is that no one seems to know

01:10:14.282 --> 01:10:17.718
what's going on, wouldn't that
bother you?

01:10:18.653 --> 01:10:20.087
That's your cue to speak.

01:10:20.154 --> 01:10:21.454
Cap, we were on our way
to follow up on a lead

01:10:21.555 --> 01:10:23.124
just before you showed up.

01:10:23.224 --> 01:10:25.059
I want answers tonight,
so before you two

01:10:25.126 --> 01:10:27.327
decide to go home and lay
your pretty little heads

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:32.066
on your pillow, I want a
phone call with answers.

01:10:32.133 --> 01:10:35.335
Why are you still standing here?

01:10:39.472 --> 01:10:40.908
She's such a bitch.

01:10:40.975 --> 01:10:43.244
You telling me, you
thinking what I'm thinking?

01:10:43.311 --> 01:10:46.247
Way ahead of you, here, you
drive.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.323
Damn dog, watch where
the fuck you're going, man.

01:10:55.422 --> 01:10:57.091
Ay yo, you Rahmeen?

01:10:58.259 --> 01:10:59.660
Yeah, what's up?

01:11:00.661 --> 01:11:03.130
You Smack boy Rahmeen?

01:11:03.197 --> 01:11:04.799
What is it to you?

01:11:05.967 --> 01:11:07.869
You know, I just heard
what happened to him.

01:11:08.002 --> 01:11:11.038
That's good news considering
what he did to my cousin.

01:11:14.541 --> 01:11:15.542
No, I'm just saying.

01:11:15.676 --> 01:11:17.645
He got we he deserved though

01:11:17.712 --> 01:11:20.348
but I'm gonna need you to join
him.

01:11:29.556 --> 01:11:30.490
Oh, hey.

01:11:34.195 --> 01:11:35.229
Is Nic here?

01:11:37.231 --> 01:11:39.399
He left here a while ago.

01:11:42.703 --> 01:11:44.639
Mind if I take a look around?

01:11:45.072 --> 01:11:47.675
Well, that's kinda vague.

01:11:47.742 --> 01:11:49.176
An hour, half an hour, five
hours.

01:11:49.243 --> 01:11:50.912
I don't know, why?

01:11:51.045 --> 01:11:53.413
Is he in trouble or something?

01:11:54.414 --> 01:11:56.150
We're looking into a few
things

01:11:56.217 --> 01:11:58.319
but we would like to speak with
him.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.055
It's all clear.

01:12:01.155 --> 01:12:03.257
My card, if he shows up here,

01:12:03.391 --> 01:12:05.558
can you please give me a call?

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.294
Why?

01:13:49.196 --> 01:13:51.332
Wait, let me explain.

01:13:52.666 --> 01:13:53.834
Let me explain.

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:04.011
Why?

01:14:07.515 --> 01:14:08.449
Kevin?

01:14:13.954 --> 01:14:16.524
Why?

01:14:17.792 --> 01:14:20.795
In life we make plenty of
mistakes.

01:14:22.396 --> 01:14:26.834
Sometimes we get plenty of
chances to make things right.

01:14:28.402 --> 01:14:32.473
For me, this was my last shot.

01:14:34.375 --> 01:14:38.212
I didn't realize then,
when you hurt someone,

01:14:38.312 --> 01:14:39.880
it affects everyone.

01:14:42.383 --> 01:14:46.720
The bottom line is karma is a
motherfucker.

01:14:48.756 --> 01:14:51.926
And I was staring it right in
the face.

01:14:54.995 --> 01:14:56.163
I'm sorry.

01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:12.947
Hello.

01:15:13.747 --> 01:15:15.449
Okay we're on it.

01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:16.617
Someone reported they heard a
gunshot

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:17.918
at Mark Toomer's place.

01:15:18.018 --> 01:15:19.520
I think we got 'em.

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:27.795
Get off!

01:15:27.928 --> 01:15:28.629
Get off, get off!

01:15:28.762 --> 01:15:29.630
Let me explain, man!

01:15:29.763 --> 01:15:31.265
Kevin wait!

01:15:31.365 --> 01:15:32.700
Let me explain.

01:15:32.766 --> 01:15:35.604
I know I can't take
back the shit I've done.

01:15:35.703 --> 01:15:39.206
I know you mad at me man, I
understand.

01:15:39.273 --> 01:15:42.877
But I just ask you to hear me
out, please?

01:15:42.943 --> 01:15:45.946
Just give me a chance, man?

01:15:46.547 --> 01:15:47.448
Please Kevin?

01:15:47.781 --> 01:15:48.482
Get off.

01:15:48.617 --> 01:15:49.950
Kevin, Kevin!

01:15:52.653 --> 01:15:53.622
Kevin!

01:16:32.326 --> 01:16:33.761
We're all clear.

01:16:42.604 --> 01:16:44.171
Yo, what the fuck y'all
doing in my crib, man?

01:16:44.171 --> 01:16:45.005
Get the fuck on the ground!

01:16:45.272 --> 01:16:46.675
- Get the fuck on the ground.
- Yo, I ain't do shit!

01:16:46.774 --> 01:16:47.508
Shut up!

01:16:47.508 --> 01:16:48.442
Fuck y'all doing?

01:16:48.509 --> 01:16:49.644
Get your fucking hands behind
your back.

01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:52.012
Ay man, I ain't do shit.

01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:54.014
Yeah, that's what they all
say.

01:16:54.114 --> 01:16:55.182
Fuck you.

01:16:55.382 --> 01:16:58.219
Yeah, you gon' be doing a
lot of fucking where you going.

01:16:58.352 --> 01:16:59.486
Hey Ferguson.

01:17:02.356 --> 01:17:03.290
That too.

01:17:07.061 --> 01:17:09.863
