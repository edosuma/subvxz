WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:07.039
Max, guess what Han's doing
at the counter?

00:07.041 --> 00:10.843
Well, I know it's not
towering over it.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.846
He's creating signature drinks
for the diner.

00:13.848 --> 00:18.283
I suggested any household poison
over shaved ice.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.619
Han, this is a stupid idea.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.687
It was Earl's.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.390
Then it's genius.

00:24.392 --> 00:29.561
Yep, I've been drinking
all afternoon for free.

00:29.563 --> 00:32.064
Now, I've used only
top shelf liquor.

00:32.066 --> 00:36.201
Question: Who got it down
for you?

00:36.203 --> 00:39.238
First up: "The Max".
It's just whiskey.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.375
On the rocks, like Max's job.

00:43.377 --> 00:47.312
Whatever mine is,
I want my rim salted.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.718
Of course you do.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.521
Earl's is an Old Fashioned
with everything.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.556
Pour me another me.

00:57.558 --> 01:01.727
I hate to say it,
but I go down easy.

01:01.729 --> 01:05.731
"The Caroline" is Lemon Schnapps
in a slightly frosty glass.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.000
Because of my cool,
Grace Kelly kind of demeanor?

01:08.002 --> 01:09.802
No, because they had a sale
on Lemon Schnapps

01:09.804 --> 01:12.771
at Beverage Barn

01:12.773 --> 01:15.908
Oh, they don't card there?

01:15.910 --> 01:17.843
Okay, so what's "The Han"?

01:17.845 --> 01:20.946
A No Sex on the Beach?

01:20.948 --> 01:23.582
Mine is a classic martini,
shaken.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.784
Oh, like the first woman
who saw you naked.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.523
Correction.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.827
Will see you naked.

01:34.829 --> 01:37.529
(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

01:37.531 --> 01:38.864
[cash register bell dings]

01:38.866 --> 01:42.434
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

01:48.042 --> 01:49.708
Max, guess what happened
when you were running

01:49.710 --> 01:52.478
to the bathroom real quick,
for two hours.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.812
You worked the cupcake window
while I went

01:53.814 --> 01:57.049
to see The Statue
of Liberty.

01:57.051 --> 01:59.084
Her head was being
renovated.

01:59.086 --> 02:02.287
Everybody in this town
is getting work done.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.289
I sold our last cupcake tee!

02:04.291 --> 02:05.958
We've sold out more than
Robert De Niro

02:05.960 --> 02:09.228
in the last 20 years
of his career.

02:09.230 --> 02:13.599
Well, analyze this, Focker.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.734
I noticed we were running low
last week,

02:15.736 --> 02:18.437
so I ordered more.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.506
How did I not notice
those sooner?

02:20.508 --> 02:22.407
Oh, probably because
the last time I looked in there,

02:22.409 --> 02:26.745
there was a rat having sex
with a cockroach.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.281
You know, they're still dating.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.984
Really? I thought
it was a one time thing.

02:31.986 --> 02:36.755
Well, I guess once you go
rat, you never go back.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.191
Thanks for ordering these,
I've just been so busy

02:39.193 --> 02:40.592
with Sophie's wedding shower.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.793
Yeah, why are you working
so hard?

02:41.795 --> 02:43.295
It's not a big deal.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.531
I threw my mother
a shower once.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.300
No wait, I threw her
in a shower once.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.802
Max, you really need to start
making more of a fuss.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.504
It's for Sophie,
it means a lot to her,

02:52.506 --> 02:54.873
and she has a gun.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.643
Well, showers are stupid
girl things

02:57.645 --> 03:01.680
that this guy
wants no part of.

03:01.682 --> 03:05.083
Hey, girls!

03:05.085 --> 03:08.954
Look. I'm advertising
your cupcake business.

03:08.956 --> 03:12.758
You're advertising something,
but it's not our cupcakes.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.027
I gave out free T-shirts
to our building.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.196
I left one
by everyone's door.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.464
Two at Sophie's,
16 at the Sanchez's.

03:19.466 --> 03:23.035
So about six of the kids
will have to share.

03:23.037 --> 03:26.071
Interesting. Now our shirts
are available at both Rodney,

03:26.073 --> 03:27.973
the high-end Manhattan
boutique,

03:27.975 --> 03:29.708
and an apartment
building that always smells

03:29.710 --> 03:32.744
a little like gasoline.

03:32.746 --> 03:36.315
Well, please stop talking about
things that aren't me.

03:36.317 --> 03:41.086
Now girls,
did you get the cake

03:41.088 --> 03:43.322
for my wedding shower
tomorrow?

03:43.324 --> 03:45.591
Oh, was I supposed
to make a cake?

03:45.593 --> 03:47.593
I've literally done
nothing for this shower.

03:47.595 --> 03:51.063
I haven't even taken a bath.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.899
Oh, no, I'm not getting my cake
from here.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.235
No, this is my bridal shower.

03:56.237 --> 03:59.204
Yeah, I want to get something
classic from Baskin Robbins

03:59.206 --> 04:03.041
that's also a Dunkin' Donuts.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.344
They mix those two now?

04:05.346 --> 04:09.147
It's a stoner's dream come true.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.816
I tried to make our apartment
look nice.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.051
I even moved a chair
to cover a stain,

04:13.053 --> 04:15.420
but what was under the chair
was so much worse.

04:15.422 --> 04:19.157
I guess what I'm saying is,
please don't shoot us.

04:19.159 --> 04:22.227
Well, I don't expect it
to look that good.

04:22.229 --> 04:25.731
I mean, you can't put
a silk hat on a pig.

04:25.733 --> 04:29.101
And I know,
'cause I tried once.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.243
[gags]

04:45.085 --> 04:46.084
[gags]

04:49.523 --> 04:52.524
Max! Oh, my God!
What have you done?

04:52.526 --> 04:56.094
I realized I don't like
a strawberry center.

04:56.096 --> 04:59.698
And I am not going to beat
myself up about it.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.134
When I told you
to get crepe paper streamers

05:02.136 --> 05:06.038
and decorate for the shower,
I meant with pink, not black.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.873
It's a wedding shower
for Sophie,

05:07.875 --> 05:11.877
not a baby shower
for Rosemary's Baby.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.980
What? I told you,
I don't do girl things.

05:14.982 --> 05:19.384
Like hang pink
or sit when I pee.

05:19.386 --> 05:25.157
Which, coincidentally,
I refer to as "hanging pink."

05:25.159 --> 05:27.392
My God, what is that smell?

05:27.394 --> 05:29.494
Something's really gone
bad here.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.030
Besides our lives.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.665
It's the Polish food.

05:33.667 --> 05:37.169
I think one of those sausages
is made of old flip-flops.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.170
[knock at door]

05:38.172 --> 05:40.339
Someone's here already?

05:40.341 --> 05:41.873
Are Polish people always early?

05:41.875 --> 05:47.546
Is that a stereotype
I don't know about?

05:47.548 --> 05:52.084
Oh my God!

05:52.086 --> 05:55.253
A wedding shower for me?

05:55.255 --> 06:00.425
I mean, if I had known,
I would have dressed!

06:00.427 --> 06:02.260
Sophie, you did know.

06:02.262 --> 06:05.731
I know. I came down early
to practice some entrances.

06:05.733 --> 06:10.769
Now get ready for entrance
number two.

06:10.771 --> 06:15.474
Are you ever ready
for entrance number two?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.676
[knock at door]

06:17.678 --> 06:21.847
Who is it?

06:21.849 --> 06:24.850
[fakes weeping]

06:24.852 --> 06:26.985
Oh my God!

06:41.602 --> 06:44.202
Now, come on in here
and identify some of this

06:44.204 --> 06:47.539
Polish food so I can know
what I'm not eating tonight.

06:47.541 --> 06:50.041
Oh, no.
I'm not eating at my shower.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.110
I'm pretending
I have an eating disorder

06:52.112 --> 06:57.315
so everyone will think
that I have it all.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.683
I think you're going to be
happy.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.452
I have lots
of fun shower games,

07:00.454 --> 07:03.255
starting with "Who Knows
The Most About Sophie?"

07:03.257 --> 07:06.057
Oh, I'll win that one.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.092
Yeah.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.927
And Sophie's got to tinkle.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.863
See?
I'm a shoo-in.

07:11.865 --> 07:15.634
Yeah.
Oh. Oh, my gosh.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.936
Black toilet paper.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.772
Oh, nice touch, girls.

07:20.774 --> 07:25.243
Yeah, I love the mystery
of not knowing when you're done.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.715
[knock at door]

07:30.717 --> 07:32.284
(Agent Drake)
FBI! Open up!

07:32.286 --> 07:35.387
The FBI?
I don't think they RSVP'd.

07:35.389 --> 07:39.257
Oh, that's got to be for me.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.159
I didn't do it.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.962
And just so you know,
the statute of limitations is up

07:43.964 --> 07:46.631
on that Newark thing.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.233
I'm not here to arrest you,
miss.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.768
Great, it's me.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.671
Max, I told you pirating movies
was a real crime.

07:52.673 --> 07:57.175
Now I'm going to jail
for<i> Fifty Shades Of Grey.</i>

07:57.177 --> 08:00.312
Someone should.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.047
I hear you,
not the Christian Grey

08:02.049 --> 08:06.718
I'd pictured.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.520
I'm Agent Drake with the FBI.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.755
Nothing to get upset about, but
there's a man in your building

08:10.757 --> 08:11.923
who's been holding
three women hostage

08:11.925 --> 08:13.825
in his apartment for months.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.761
Yeah, that sounds about right.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.430
Now, one of the captives
escaped today

08:18.432 --> 08:20.165
and alerted authorities.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.333
Oh, that must have been
the lady I passed

08:21.335 --> 08:24.669
screaming in the hall.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.538
What? There is a fine line
between "hostage"

08:26.540 --> 08:30.108
and "off your meds"
in this building.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.243
So, a SWAT team
is going in

08:31.245 --> 08:32.577
for the other two
still upstairs.

08:32.579 --> 08:33.678
But we need to evacuate
the building first.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.213
So let's go.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.350
All right, can I just put
a few things away first.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.552
You know, because I want
the place to look nice

08:40.554 --> 08:43.455
if there's going to be
police in here.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.090
Look, miss, whatever drugs
you're hiding in here,

08:45.092 --> 08:46.224
I couldn't care less.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.193
We need to get out now.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.096
You know,
you're just my type of guy.

08:51.098 --> 08:55.066
You don't mind my drug use
and you're already here.

08:59.172 --> 09:03.441
Oh, yeah!

09:03.443 --> 09:09.047
You girls ordered a cop stripper
for my bridal shower?

09:09.049 --> 09:12.651
Oh, here comes
the bride all right! Yeah!

09:12.653 --> 09:15.620
Come on.
Yeah.

09:15.622 --> 09:19.424
Yeah, see?
Look, he likes me.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.763
I cannot believe
I live in this building

09:24.765 --> 09:27.432
with a man who would do
something so awful.

09:27.434 --> 09:30.769
Also, cannot believe
I live in this building.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.437
You know who I think it is?

09:32.439 --> 09:35.440
Smells Like Cats
But Has No Cats.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.944
Really? He doesn't seem
like a go-getter.

09:38.946 --> 09:42.847
I think it's Three Nipples
No Nose.

09:42.849 --> 09:46.952
Three Nipples No Nose?
He's a delight.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.220
Sophie, isn't this upsetting?

09:49.222 --> 09:50.956
It sure is.

09:50.958 --> 09:55.026
I couldn't get that stripper cop
to take his pants off.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.930
Hey, look, there's some
of my shower guests.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.765
Oh, look.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.300
And see?
That one's my friend Natalya.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.868
The one I told you about.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.304
Yeah, there's all that
extra skin.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.107
Ew.
You were not exaggerating.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.242
She was born
with all that skin.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.078
She had a chip clip
on her back

10:13.080 --> 10:17.616
all through high school.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.452
Yeah, I know that guy upstairs
is a real bummer,

10:20.454 --> 10:22.954
but you know what would help?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.757
If I could open my presents.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.492
Yeah.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.394
(Sophie)
Oh, no!

10:29.396 --> 10:31.296
The fuzz isn't letting them
through!

10:31.298 --> 10:32.897
Oh, come on.

10:32.899 --> 10:36.001
No fair, they just let a guy
in here a few minutes ago.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.269
Just 'cause your friends
aren't bomb-sniffing dogs,

10:38.271 --> 10:41.573
they can't get in?
Boo!

10:41.575 --> 10:45.844
Hey, look, ladies, pass
your presents up to the cops.

10:45.846 --> 10:49.581
Cops, pass my presents to me.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.349
Wait, Sophie,
before you open them,

10:51.351 --> 10:53.318
I really want to write down
who got you what.

10:53.320 --> 10:57.155
And save that pretty ribbon,
I'm gonna make you a bow hat!

10:57.157 --> 10:58.356
Look at you.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.892
Making lemonade
out of a maniac

11:00.894 --> 11:03.428
holding three innocent women
hostage.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.230
(Sophie)
Oh, a gift card.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.433
Oh, send it back.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.035
Sophie, we would've taken that.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.503
I don't know what is was for,

11:11.505 --> 11:13.405
I just know that we would've
taken it.

11:13.407 --> 11:15.106
No, I'm sending it back.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.842
I want a gift,
not another errand.

11:17.844 --> 11:21.913
Oh, yeah, not in love
with the paper, but...

11:21.915 --> 11:25.684
well, I'll wait till
I open it to judge.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.185
(Maria)
Hi.
Excuse me.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.420
Excuse me?

11:28.422 --> 11:31.189
I'm Maria Alonso-Gonzalez.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.624
Could you ladies talk
to Channel 2

11:32.626 --> 11:34.693
about tonight's disturbing
discovery?

11:34.695 --> 11:36.061
- No.
- Yes.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.196
Just go with me
and my business savvy.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.633
Yes, Maria Alonso-Gonzalez,
we can answer a few questions.

11:41.635 --> 11:44.302
Were there any signs at all
that something of this nature

11:44.304 --> 11:46.304
was going on in your building?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.073
We jut hope they bring
this sick freak

11:48.075 --> 11:50.875
in our building to justice
so that we can return to work

11:50.877 --> 11:53.878
at Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.680
(Maria)
Get on the door.
Here he comes.

11:55.682 --> 11:58.049
Who is it?
Who is this sick freak?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.989
It's not me.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.459
Is it?

12:07.461 --> 12:11.663
I'm not sure,
what are the charges?

12:11.665 --> 12:13.898
Different sick freak.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.569
Hey, Rula, Uma, Greta, look.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.870
(Sophie)
This is him.

12:18.872 --> 12:22.507
This is the groom-to-be.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.476
Forget about the guy upstairs,

12:24.478 --> 12:29.314
this is the real maniac
in the bedroom.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.015
[gasping]

12:31.017 --> 12:32.650
That's him?

12:32.652 --> 12:35.253
Beer Belly Gym Shorts?

12:35.255 --> 12:36.988
- Never would've guessed.
- Oh, no.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.424
(Caroline)
He's wearing one of our shirts.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.692
Why?

12:40.694 --> 12:43.762
Why? Why is he wearing
a medium?

12:48.702 --> 12:51.269
Oh...

12:51.271 --> 12:52.771
I mean, nobody's gonna see that.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.279
(Maria)
Police have just apprehended
the suspect

13:01.281 --> 13:04.349
and the question on
everyone's mind is,

13:04.351 --> 13:06.684
"What does Max's Homemade
Cupcakes

13:06.686 --> 13:10.955
have to do with this?"

13:10.957 --> 13:12.624
We have no comment.

13:12.626 --> 13:16.094
Or future, or deodorant.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.696
So leave us alone!

13:18.698 --> 13:20.298
How did they find out we work
in this dump,

13:20.300 --> 13:21.766
next door to the other dump?

13:21.768 --> 13:23.134
As I'm saying it,
I realize our career

13:23.136 --> 13:25.770
is made up of two dumps.

13:25.772 --> 13:28.506
Sounds like our career has been
drinking too much coffee.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.709
The story is all over the paper.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.679
They're calling those ladies
"The Cupcake Captives,"

13:34.681 --> 13:36.714
calling that guy
"The Cupcake Captor,"

13:36.716 --> 13:40.685
and calling the whole thing
"The Cupcake Catastrophe."

13:40.687 --> 13:42.720
But you needn't worry about it
reflecting badly

13:42.722 --> 13:45.290
on your cupcake business.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.726
Oh, no. It's even
in the fashion section.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.229
There's a picture
of our shirts and it says,

13:51.231 --> 13:55.767
"What not to wear, ever."

13:55.769 --> 13:58.069
Okay. Everybody calm down.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.405
I'm mostly talking to myself.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.540
The media is just going
to do its thing.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.742
I've been slandered
in the headlines before.

14:04.744 --> 14:08.479
I was called "Ponzi Princess,"
"Bankrupt Barbie."

14:08.481 --> 14:11.783
Looking back,
those were the best of times.

14:11.785 --> 14:14.385
Oh, hello.
I was just about to take a tray

14:14.387 --> 14:17.222
of Max and Carolines
out to my reporter friends.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.124
Sorry, you can give those
Max and Carolines

14:20.126 --> 14:23.494
to this Max and Caroline.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.797
Hi, everybody.

14:25.799 --> 14:27.765
Oh, I'm depressed.

14:27.767 --> 14:32.337
See, you can tell 'cause
I'm only wearing half my hair.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.406
Girls, I found this box
outside your door.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.309
And I was hoping
it was a shower present.

14:38.311 --> 14:43.615
Since those selfish hostage
girls ruined my special day.

14:43.617 --> 14:47.619
Oh, man. I didn't
even get a freakin' ribbon hat.

14:47.621 --> 14:50.822
Do you want the tube top
I made out of the police tape?

14:50.824 --> 14:53.191
I'm calling it a tape top.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.326
Patent pending.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.527
Come on, you guys.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.929
This isn't about us.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.731
We need to put this
all in perspective.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.200
We're all safe,
and healthy, and--

15:02.202 --> 15:04.335
Oh, my God, just when
I can't take anymore,

15:04.337 --> 15:06.671
here comes anymore.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.574
"We are returning the remainder
of your t-shirt stock.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.210
"Our Rodney brand cannot be
associated with a product

15:12.212 --> 15:15.513
"at the center of an ongoing
criminal investigation.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.049
Consider our contract
null and void."

15:18.051 --> 15:20.551
This is so shocking.

15:20.553 --> 15:24.055
Max, you can read?

15:24.057 --> 15:29.727
So you just didn't want to tell
people the specials.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.129
I can't believe this.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.764
We waited so long
for something to happen

15:32.766 --> 15:34.432
to our cupcake t-shirts.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.867
Why that guy?

15:35.869 --> 15:37.068
And on the one day
he chooses to not wear

15:37.070 --> 15:39.737
his "Pull my finger" shirt.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.540
(Maria)
This is Maria Alonso-Gonzalez,
reporting to you live...

15:42.542 --> 15:44.108
Max, what are you doing?
They'll see us.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.610
- from Max's Homemade Cupcakes.
- No they won't,

15:45.612 --> 15:48.880
Because call the cameras
are on Han right now.

15:48.882 --> 15:50.581
Can you talk a little bit
about the women

15:50.583 --> 15:53.418
behind
Max's Homemade Cupcakes?

15:53.420 --> 15:55.954
Well, let's just say
Max and Caroline

15:55.956 --> 15:58.456
are allergic to work,
much in the same way

15:58.458 --> 16:00.358
Dilbert is allergic
to Mondays.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.161
[laughs]

16:03.163 --> 16:05.496
Moving on,
Maria Alonso-Gonzalez,

16:05.498 --> 16:07.332
would you care to come into
The Williamsburg Diner,

16:07.334 --> 16:09.867
6355 Bedford Avenue,

16:09.869 --> 16:11.669
open 8:00 A.M. till 2:00 A.M.,

16:11.671 --> 16:15.340
for our signature drink:
The Cupcake Captive Cosmo?

16:15.342 --> 16:19.544
And for you gents,
The Captive Cape Cod?

16:22.015 --> 16:23.514
Hey, get these cupcakes
out of the garbage.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.551
I need to make room
for Han's body.

16:26.553 --> 16:30.121
I'm keeping the head as a
warning to others who cross us.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.856
We need to take back
our t-shirts' image

16:31.858 --> 16:33.725
by setting up an interview
with the news.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.860
And by "we," I mean you.

16:35.862 --> 16:39.998
Look, if I learned one thing
from my time on<i> Cops,</i>

16:40.000 --> 16:42.967
it's that I can hop a fence
in three seconds flat.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.169
If I learned two things,
it's that the camera

16:45.171 --> 16:47.305
makes me look guilty.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.708
Especially when it's a security
camera at Banana Republic.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.076
I can't do it.

16:52.078 --> 16:53.511
The world can't know
that Caroline Channing

16:53.513 --> 16:56.314
is involved in another
high-profile crime.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.083
And hasn't kept up her nail
maintenance, like, at all.

16:59.085 --> 17:00.585
Fine.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.654
Because if I learned
three things from<i> Cops,</i>

17:03.656 --> 17:06.424
it's that it's best to surrender
early and not naked.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.664
We really appreciate you
taking the time to talk to us.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.233
If you really
want to thank me,

17:15.235 --> 17:18.236
how about I get some pixels
up over my grill?

17:18.238 --> 17:22.006
I got some kids looking for me
and they don't need the help.

17:22.008 --> 17:24.175
We don't have the capability
to do that.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.810
This is live TV.

17:25.812 --> 17:28.780
How about one of those
voice distorting machines?

17:28.782 --> 17:32.183
You know, make my voice sound
like a fat Transformer.

17:32.185 --> 17:35.119
Um, no.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.521
No problem.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.423
I'll take care of that myself.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.959
Been in this sitch before.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.262
All right, in 3, 2...

17:44.264 --> 17:45.863
Good evening.
In Williamsburg...

17:45.865 --> 17:47.365
Max, I'm right here,
if you need me.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.100
I got this.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.501
Now infamous in the shocking
"Cupcake Captives" story.

17:50.503 --> 17:54.672
I'm here with the owner,
Max Black.

17:54.674 --> 17:59.510
[distorted]
Hi, Maria.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.447
Max, how upset were you to see
that Richard Griffin

18:02.449 --> 18:05.283
was Max's Homemade Cupcakes'
biggest fan?

18:05.285 --> 18:07.285
[distorted]
I was really upset.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.420
Okay, hi.
Stepping in.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.289
Max is clearly so upset
by all this

18:11.291 --> 18:13.391
that she's lost her mind.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.893
The one time
I really needed her, anyway.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.261
Hi, Maria.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.697
How will your company's
reputation recover

18:19.699 --> 18:21.432
from doing business
with a man

18:21.434 --> 18:24.769
who held three women in his
apartment against their will?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.971
Look, people
do terrible things.

18:26.973 --> 18:30.141
And they do them
wearing shirts.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.642
That doesn't make
the shirt evil.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.878
Now, if a shirt
commits a crime, lock it up.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.980
You'll get
no argument from me.

18:35.982 --> 18:41.052
[distorted]
Should I jump back in?

18:41.054 --> 18:43.287
Okay, yeah.
That's all the time we have.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.322
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.323
[distorted]
Thank you.

18:51.097 --> 18:54.732
Caroline, thank you
for trying to throw me a shower.

18:54.734 --> 18:58.302
I mean, we were
never really friends or close.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.705
And yeah, I run away when
I see you heading towards

19:00.707 --> 19:02.540
the mailboxes the same time
as me--

19:02.542 --> 19:05.543
Please stop thanking me.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.578
Hey. Want to come
to our place?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.714
Those pig feet
haven't gone bad.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.716
I guess.
It's hard to tell.

19:11.718 --> 19:17.021
Yeah. The best meat's
under the toe nails.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.022
Is it?

19:23.396 --> 19:26.364
(all)
Surprise.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.432
[shouting]

19:28.434 --> 19:30.234
Oh, my God, what's all this?

19:30.236 --> 19:31.569
Oh, no.
I'm so surprised.

19:31.571 --> 19:34.071
No, I really am this time.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.440
- So am I.
- Me, too.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.009
Until this sausage,
I thought the grossest thing

19:38.011 --> 19:39.944
I'd ever eaten was kale.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.846
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.782
Could anything be
more wonderful?

19:44.784 --> 19:47.218
[laughs]

19:47.220 --> 19:50.021
Max, I can't believe
you did all this.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.422
I thought you came home
to do what you usually do

19:51.424 --> 19:53.024
when you get depressed.

19:53.026 --> 19:56.394
Get drunk and throw the finger
at people from the stoop.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.696
No stoop.
But I am drunk.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.598
You think I could've
done this sober?

20:00.600 --> 20:03.467
I just figured, with everything
around us being so black lately,

20:03.469 --> 20:05.403
I thought we needed
a little pink.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.637
You're right. We did.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.306
'Cause our t-shirt business
is over.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.709
And we still have to pay off
that bank loan. Now what?

20:11.711 --> 20:14.445
We'll figure something out.
We always do.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.280
Hey, girls, come quick.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.983
We're gonna play "Guess Sophie's
Favorite Sex Position"

20:18.985 --> 20:21.919
(all)
Whoo!

20:21.921 --> 20:25.890
It's on all fours, watching
<i>How To Get Away With Murder.</i>

20:25.892 --> 20:28.626
See?
I told you I was gonna win.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.065
And it just got black again.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.067
Yeah, real black.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.802
This is wet!

20:37.804 --> 20:39.303
Max, did you already eat this?

20:39.305 --> 20:42.073
I told you, I don't like
a strawberry center.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.575
And I am not gonna
beat myself up about it.
