00:42.083 --> 00:43.250
<i> Time.</i>

00:46.625 --> 00:47.750
<i>Space.</i>

00:49.041 --> 00:50.208
<i>Reality.</i>

00:53.291 --> 00:55.125
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

00:59.916 --> 01:04.458
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

01:06.833 --> 01:10.541
<i>where a single choice</i>
<i>can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

01:12.958 --> 01:16.041
<i>creating alternate worlds</i>
<i>from the ones you know.</i>

01:20.000 --> 01:21.291
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

01:23.625 --> 01:26.958
<i>I am your guide</i>
<i>through these vast new realities.</i>

01:28.250 --> 01:31.708
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

01:35.291 --> 01:36.333
<i>"What if?"</i>

01:41.875 --> 01:43.375
The <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

01:43.458 --> 01:46.166
They were sending their last payload
when pirates took the ship.

01:46.250 --> 01:50.416
-How many pirates?
-Twenty or so charmers led by Batroc.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.541
Before French special forces
showed him the door,

01:52.625 --> 01:55.333
he racked up 36 kill missions.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.166
Hmm. Sounds more like your type.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.916
Fine. I've got the shield.
You've got the sword.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.166
More like knives, but cute wordplay.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.750
Kill the engines and find the hostages.
Gentlemen, watch our six.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.791
STRIKE Team,
you heard the captain, gear up.

02:08.458 --> 02:10.666
So, any plans for Saturday night?

02:10.750 --> 02:12.416
No, don't. Stop right there.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.625
Bernard in accounting
was asking about you.

02:14.708 --> 02:18.625
Nothing good has ever followed the phrase,
"Bernard in accounting."

02:20.708 --> 02:22.375
What if his name was Steve?

02:22.458 --> 02:25.000
Ouch! Just when
we were becoming pals, Widow.

02:49.875 --> 02:53.541
I thought
you were more than just a shield.

02:56.791 --> 02:58.625
I'm a pretty good dancer, too.

03:03.208 --> 03:05.041
I'm too fast.

03:10.583 --> 03:12.375
Oh! That was good.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.458
-Whoa!
-What? Are you scared?

03:19.541 --> 03:20.708
Are you seeing that?

03:22.541 --> 03:27.250
Captain Carter, the soldier lost in time,
you have been chosen.

03:33.833 --> 03:35.583
Oh, come on. Relax, son.

03:35.666 --> 03:38.041
It'll all be over
in a thousand years or so.

03:39.041 --> 03:40.041
Huh?

03:41.708 --> 03:42.708
-Hey.

03:44.958 --> 03:48.041
Stay here. Leave this fight to us.

03:48.125 --> 03:52.041
I got it. Yeah. Hang back
with the giant baby-man cape dude.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.291
Star-Lord T'Challa, leader of the Ravagers
and lost Prince of Wakanda,

03:57.375 --> 03:59.750
you have been chosen.

04:08.541 --> 04:10.041
These Infinity Stones...

04:10.125 --> 04:12.375
I'm out of the weapons business,
not my cake.

04:12.458 --> 04:16.375
But how do we put a suit of armor
around the world? Hmm?

04:16.458 --> 04:17.666
Around the galaxy?

04:17.750 --> 04:19.916
You can't tell me
there's not another big, bad

04:20.000 --> 04:21.875
lurking-in-the-shadows monster
under the bed.

04:21.958 --> 04:23.416
-Tony!

04:25.000 --> 04:27.791
Gamora, survivor of Sakaar
and destroyer of Thanos...

04:27.875 --> 04:30.291
And one who's about to kick
your moon-shaped, ugly mug.

04:30.375 --> 04:34.500
Not you, Stark.
You, Gamora, have been chosen.

04:35.833 --> 04:39.208
Killmonger must be tried for murder
under Wakandan law.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.791
The Americans can have him
after we're finished.

04:45.625 --> 04:48.250
Erik Stevens, Killmonger,

04:48.333 --> 04:52.083
Tony Stark's former protégé and killer,

04:52.166 --> 04:54.750
you have been chosen.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.791
We were about to go on a date!

05:06.875 --> 05:09.916
There were gonna be flowers,
and I was gonna light candles,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.458
and I was gonna shower
and do my hair.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.041
Nobody messes with Vegas.

05:17.125 --> 05:20.166
How about you? And you?

05:20.250 --> 05:22.875
Finally, Thor Odinson,
Crown Prince of As...

05:22.958 --> 05:24.208
And you. And you.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.583
You've been cho...

05:25.666 --> 05:27.666
-Have at you, too.
-Thor. Thor!

05:27.750 --> 05:30.208
-And you. And you.
-Shh. Calm down.

05:30.916 --> 05:34.833
-Thor Odinson, Crown Prince of Asgard...

05:34.916 --> 05:36.291
You've been chosen.

05:39.291 --> 05:40.875
Oh, we're in a pub.

05:40.958 --> 05:42.625
I know this place.

05:45.166 --> 05:46.750
The pub facade was my idea.

05:46.833 --> 05:49.625
I read about it in your biography.
I hope you like it.

05:49.708 --> 05:51.833
Over here. Me, me. Can I get a beer?

05:53.375 --> 05:54.375
Yes!

05:56.125 --> 05:58.041
-- Uh, who are you?
-- Where am I?

05:58.125 --> 06:00.583
T'Why did you bring us here?
What do you want with us?

06:00.666 --> 06:02.041
DR.All good questions.

06:02.125 --> 06:03.916
-Send me back. Now.

06:09.208 --> 06:12.416
-It's you again.
-Come on. Get a new trick, man.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.083
You have been chosen...

06:15.166 --> 06:18.958
for a mission that is both
highly dangerous and absolutely necessary

06:19.041 --> 06:22.000
for the continuation of life
as you know it.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.625
At first, I scoured eternity
for one true hero.

06:26.708 --> 06:28.541
Then I saw the bigger picture.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.791
This mission requires a team.

06:30.875 --> 06:34.916
The perfect combination of skills
and experience that alone will triumph.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.083
Let me get this straight.

06:36.166 --> 06:40.083
You kidnapped us from across the galaxy
so we could, what?

06:40.166 --> 06:41.375
Save the universe?

06:41.458 --> 06:42.875
Mmm. Not exactly.

06:42.958 --> 06:44.583
Bit more complicated than that.

06:44.666 --> 06:47.666
You aren't just our best hope
to save one universe.

06:47.750 --> 06:50.791
You are my last hope to save all of them.

06:51.666 --> 06:55.375
You are the Guardians of the Multiverse.

06:58.708 --> 07:01.291
I know what this is.
Loki put you up to this joke.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.833
Listen, I do not have time
for his pranks today.

07:03.916 --> 07:05.083
No, I wouldn't do that.

07:05.166 --> 07:07.791
My lady Jane needs me.
So, I'll be going. Enjoy yourse...

07:15.875 --> 07:18.625
We're in. Mind telling us
what we're up against?

07:19.416 --> 07:23.125
Your worlds are either
under attack or soon will be by Ultron,

07:23.625 --> 07:26.041
an artificial intelligence
elevated to a cosmic being

07:26.125 --> 07:30.000
thanks to an enhanced synthetic body
and the power of the Infinity Stones.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.541
DR.Six stones
of near unfathomable power.

07:32.625 --> 07:35.708
Each controlling
an essential aspect of our existence.

07:35.791 --> 07:38.083
And Ultron holds all of them.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.375
I might be able to help with that.
I've stolen more from worse.

07:41.458 --> 07:43.833
Seriously?
You really are from another planet.

07:44.166 --> 07:48.083
We believe the only way to stop Ultron
is to separate his body from the stones.

07:48.166 --> 07:51.375
But this Ultron could be hiding
anywhere in the Multiverse?

07:51.458 --> 07:54.041
-Yes.
-Behind an army of killer robots?

07:54.125 --> 07:56.791
-Afraid so.
-And armed with a full set of stones?

07:56.875 --> 07:59.208
-She's got a point.
-I never said it would be easy.

07:59.291 --> 08:00.625
This is a suicide mission.

08:00.708 --> 08:01.708
Um, excuse me, yeah.

08:01.791 --> 08:05.625
Is there a universe of Chinese food
that has alternate dimension delivery?

08:05.708 --> 08:07.333
Tummy's getting rumbly.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.000
You picked them.

08:09.958 --> 08:12.500
Well, obviously the first step
would be finding him.

08:12.583 --> 08:14.083
Well, I'm not one to brag,

08:14.166 --> 08:18.208
but I've been told that I excel
at attracting unwanted attention.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.958
Oh. That will come in handy.

08:24.041 --> 08:26.708
And after we recover the stones,
we destroy them.

08:26.791 --> 08:29.083
How would you even
go about destroying the...

08:29.166 --> 08:31.333
Oh, you're answering my question.
Sorry. Thank you.

08:31.416 --> 08:32.916
The Infinity Crusher,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.958
designed to disintegrate each stone
into nothing.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.125
Yep. I picked them.

08:38.916 --> 08:41.875
All right, everyone, you all know
what to do. You know the plan.

08:41.958 --> 08:44.791
Get the Soul Stone and get it to Gamora.

08:44.875 --> 08:47.500
We'll hold the line.
And then she'll unleash the Crusher.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.416
With some luck, we'll be home for dinner.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.083
Okay, wait. Slow down a little bit.

08:51.166 --> 08:53.458
There's a few people in the room
that don't understand.

08:53.541 --> 08:56.208
Not me. I get it.
But for them, maybe repeat it.

08:56.708 --> 09:01.541
Hmm. You're ready.
It's showtime, my friends. Good luck.

09:08.583 --> 09:09.916
This place is safe?

09:10.000 --> 09:13.666
Apparently, there's not enough
intelligent life here to attract Ultron.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.333
Until we decide to.

09:19.583 --> 09:22.083
-Can I ask, what happened?

09:22.666 --> 09:25.958
Same thing that happened to you. Love.

09:26.041 --> 09:29.375
I take it you know the Captain Carter
on your universe?

09:29.458 --> 09:31.708
No. Captain America.

09:31.791 --> 09:34.708
In my universe,
Steve Rogers received the serum.

09:34.791 --> 09:37.166
Now, that would be a sight to see.

09:45.625 --> 09:46.833
You trust him?

09:51.083 --> 09:52.166
I trust everyone.

09:52.875 --> 09:57.250
Hasten, friends. Tonight we feast.
For tomorrow, we fight.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.500
In that spirit, I propose a toast.

09:59.583 --> 10:02.625
-- Some mead. Wonderful.
-- Ooh. Now we're talking.

10:02.708 --> 10:07.208
A wise sorcerer once told me
that to face death is part of the plan.

10:07.833 --> 10:12.125
To face death is to conquer
one's greatest fear of the unknown

10:12.208 --> 10:16.875
of nothingless space,
of the end of all ends.

10:16.958 --> 10:21.958
The senseless nothing and the vast
opening of infinity to your...

10:22.041 --> 10:24.083
Let me. You've done enough, Doctor.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.625
To the Guardians of...

10:26.708 --> 10:28.458
The Multiverse.

10:29.916 --> 10:33.000
The Multiverse!

10:36.750 --> 10:43.000
So there is life
in this universe, after all.

10:43.083 --> 10:44.833
There goes waiting until we're ready.

10:44.916 --> 10:46.750
In my defense, I did warn you.

10:46.833 --> 10:49.458
I excel at attracting unwanted attention.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.416
Mmm-hmm.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.708
All right, here comes
a non-compliant spell.

11:04.708 --> 11:06.000
Yeah, you might feel it.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.625
-Whoo!

11:07.708 --> 11:11.625
-Oh, what is going on?
-It's a protection spell. You're welcome.

11:11.708 --> 11:16.666
Wow! This is fantastic. Showtime. Watcher!

11:19.250 --> 11:20.833
See you on the flip side.

11:27.458 --> 11:29.583
I know how to deal with this party pooper.

11:29.666 --> 11:30.750
Wait! Thor, the plan.

11:30.833 --> 11:35.041
Viva Las Vegas!

11:44.208 --> 11:45.208
What?

11:46.333 --> 11:49.791
Can't say I've heard
that battle cry before.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.541
All too easy.

12:05.875 --> 12:06.875
Interesting.

12:06.958 --> 12:10.250
Usually, you people are
much easier to kill.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.333
Blimey! Not even a scratch.

12:12.416 --> 12:14.291
You weren't kidding
about a protection spell.

12:14.375 --> 12:17.125
-You're protected, but it won't last long.

12:23.416 --> 12:24.458
Whoo!

12:24.541 --> 12:27.166
-We're up. Are you sure about this?
-Of course not.

12:31.666 --> 12:33.083
Here we go. Now!

12:40.916 --> 12:42.000
Ha!

12:42.833 --> 12:44.875
-T'Gotcha.
-Get off!

12:58.833 --> 12:59.833
Did you get it?

12:59.916 --> 13:03.458
As Yondu says,
"Never doubt sticky fingers."

13:08.041 --> 13:09.041
Go! Go!

13:13.041 --> 13:15.541
What? You've been hiding that
the entire time?

13:16.250 --> 13:18.375
Well, this has been delightful.

13:18.458 --> 13:22.208
But it's time for me to bring out
some of my own toys.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.958
My stone. You stole my Soul Stone?

13:30.208 --> 13:31.208
Time to go.

13:42.458 --> 13:43.916
-That'll keep him busy.
-Oh!

13:44.000 --> 13:46.041
Zombies! Great idea. I love zombies.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.291
It's not them.
It's what came with the zombies.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.416
Oh...

13:49.500 --> 13:50.875
Tick tock, boys.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.208
Whoo!

13:59.458 --> 14:02.375
That was unexpected.

14:02.708 --> 14:03.833
What?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.791
Blimey bloody bollocks!

14:27.416 --> 14:28.458
Oh, you made it.

14:30.708 --> 14:32.083
-You ready?
-The stone?

14:39.541 --> 14:41.916
No, wait. Stand down.

14:42.416 --> 14:44.166
-She's Natasha Romanoff.
-Who?

14:44.250 --> 14:47.458
Yeah. I'm also supposed to be
the last person on this planet.

14:47.541 --> 14:49.625
We're from another universe. Universes.

14:49.708 --> 14:51.666
We're here to stop Ultron.

14:52.166 --> 14:53.166
I can prove it.

14:53.250 --> 14:56.333
Your father is Ivan. Your da's Alexei.

14:56.416 --> 15:00.791
And you're the one woman
I trust to have my six, including now.

15:01.666 --> 15:03.791
There are three people
you trust in the universe,

15:03.875 --> 15:06.541
and I count myself lucky enough
to be one of them.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.708
Well, we must be close.

15:12.791 --> 15:14.333
I believe the term is "BFF."

15:19.166 --> 15:22.541
I believe that you have something
that belongs to me.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.000
Natasha!

15:30.000 --> 15:31.916
Wha...

15:46.416 --> 15:49.750
I can destroy galaxies with a thought.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.833
Why won't you die?

16:03.541 --> 16:04.625
Wait. What?

16:20.791 --> 16:23.458
Give him all you've got.
Don't give him a chance to think.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.250
Vegas!

18:24.750 --> 18:25.750
You're done.

18:42.666 --> 18:44.166
Whew! Uh...

18:44.250 --> 18:46.458
-Is that it? Is it over?
-Hmm.

18:46.541 --> 18:48.708
We win? Yeah? Not so hard.

18:49.416 --> 18:51.458
It doesn't feel over.

18:52.791 --> 18:55.458
<i> I'm honestly surprised.</i>

18:56.041 --> 18:58.500
<i>Didn't the Watcher warn you?</i>

18:58.583 --> 19:03.958
<i>Every universe is different,</i>
<i>each one just a fraction unique.</i>

19:04.500 --> 19:08.083
<i>Thus the Infinity Stones are unique.</i>

19:08.166 --> 19:09.166
Of course.

19:09.250 --> 19:13.416
The Crusher was designed to destroy
the stones on my world, not his.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.208
Brace yourselves.

19:35.625 --> 19:38.291
You. It's you.

19:38.375 --> 19:41.541
If I destroy you, you all fall.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.041
Hey, Cap, I have an idea,

20:22.125 --> 20:24.666
but I'll need distance
and a clear target. Can you do that?

20:24.750 --> 20:26.583
I've got the shield. You've got the sword.

20:26.666 --> 20:29.458
More like an arrow
with the mother of all viruses in the tip,

20:29.541 --> 20:30.583
but cute wordplay.

21:21.666 --> 21:23.291
This one's for you, Clint.

22:15.041 --> 22:20.625
This is far nicer
than my human body ever was.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.166
Who's there? Who said that?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.916
This is a fascinating
change of pace, yeah?

22:26.000 --> 22:29.208
It has been a long time
since I have had legs.

22:29.291 --> 22:31.916
I'd like to make this
a permanent condition.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.833
This body is occupied.

22:33.916 --> 22:36.666
For now, but not for long.

22:36.750 --> 22:40.333
What? Who are you? What is your objective?

22:41.583 --> 22:46.666
Once upon a time, it was
to bring forth HYDRA's domination,

22:46.750 --> 22:48.583
but you ended that.

22:48.666 --> 22:54.250
So now, I suppose
my objective is to end you.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.541
What is this?

23:14.208 --> 23:16.333
-Hey, are you all right?

23:16.416 --> 23:18.375
I'm good. Mmm-hmm.

23:18.833 --> 23:21.708
Okay, that was, uh...
Can someone explain, please?

23:21.791 --> 23:24.916
I gave him a virus. A nasty one.

24:02.916 --> 24:06.541
Cousin, what are you doing?

24:07.041 --> 24:08.708
The Watcher owes us this.

24:08.791 --> 24:12.166
With these stones,
we could fix our worlds, our lives.

24:14.166 --> 24:15.541
T'Challa, Thor,

24:15.625 --> 24:18.916
are you gonna turn down the one thing
guaranteed to save your homes?

24:20.208 --> 24:23.208
Peggy, you can be with your fella again.

24:23.291 --> 24:25.625
Strange, you more than anyone
know that this is it.

24:26.458 --> 24:28.000
This is our only chance.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.833
Hand over the stones, cousin.

24:37.625 --> 24:39.208
I'm not your cousin.

24:39.291 --> 24:40.958
I'm sorry it has to end this way.

24:54.125 --> 24:59.750
Oh, no, no, no.
I am afraid that armor belongs to me.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.291
Is that Arnim Zola?

25:01.375 --> 25:03.875
HYDRA never died, it just mutated.

25:03.958 --> 25:06.291
Well, that explains the stomach-face.

25:08.791 --> 25:10.125
Huh?

25:29.500 --> 25:31.083
We were never meant to win.

25:34.333 --> 25:37.208
We were here to separate
the stones from the body.

26:30.416 --> 26:32.208
DR.You foresaw every moment

26:32.291 --> 26:36.625
from the failed Infinity Crusher,
to Killmonger's betrayal, and my...

26:36.708 --> 26:37.750
Your sacrifice.

26:37.833 --> 26:39.750
"Sacrifice"?

26:39.833 --> 26:42.125
That would imply I had something to lose.

26:42.208 --> 26:44.500
Someone needs to attend to them.

26:44.583 --> 26:47.125
If that pocket dimension cracks,
if they escape--

26:47.208 --> 26:48.416
I'll watch.

26:49.250 --> 26:50.583
I have nothing but time.

26:50.666 --> 26:52.083
Thank you, Stephen.

26:52.166 --> 26:55.666
Mmm. And besides, what are friends for?

26:58.291 --> 27:01.750
<i> The entire Multiverse</i>
<i>owes you a debt of gratitude.</i>

27:06.791 --> 27:09.375
But your worlds will never know
this victory.

27:10.666 --> 27:12.333
Once you walk through that door,

27:12.416 --> 27:14.958
you'll return
to the exact moment you left.

27:24.083 --> 27:25.708
It's time to go, Captain.

27:32.916 --> 27:34.958
You'd rather return to another time.

27:35.625 --> 27:37.916
Haven't I earned my happy ending?

27:39.125 --> 27:43.375
Trust me, that world, that time,

27:43.458 --> 27:45.583
needs Captain Carter.

28:03.875 --> 28:05.250
And then there was one.

28:05.875 --> 28:08.750
I won't go back there. My world is...

28:09.250 --> 28:11.708
gone.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.791
You won, but I lost.

28:13.875 --> 28:16.583
-I cannot in--
-Interfere? Yeah, I know.

28:16.666 --> 28:19.458
We're just stories to you. We're not real.

28:19.541 --> 28:21.958
You watch us fight, win, lose.

28:22.041 --> 28:25.666
Tell me, did you make popcorn
while Ultron murdered my friends

28:25.750 --> 28:27.208
and burned my world to the ground?

28:27.291 --> 28:29.500
You are more than that to me.

28:29.583 --> 28:30.583
Are we?

28:30.666 --> 28:33.083
You, your stories,

28:33.166 --> 28:35.916
they are everything to me.

28:36.750 --> 28:38.916
Then fix my world.

28:39.625 --> 28:42.000
I can't, Natasha.

28:44.541 --> 28:46.250
I'm not walking through that door.

28:46.875 --> 28:49.500
Well, the door was more
of a metaphor anyway.

29:04.666 --> 29:06.625
Where... Where are we?

29:06.708 --> 29:09.375
On a world that lost their Widow.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.000
It's a mess.

29:11.666 --> 29:12.708
Thank you.

29:13.500 --> 29:14.666
Hmm.

29:14.750 --> 29:17.708
You and your replacement Avengers
fought valiantly,

29:17.791 --> 29:21.583
but now I think it's time
you told me all your secrets.

29:26.916 --> 29:28.291
I was told you were dead.

29:29.208 --> 29:30.208
Same.

29:35.083 --> 29:37.125
You're not my Natasha,

29:37.666 --> 29:40.000
but something tells me
you have her spirit.

29:43.125 --> 29:44.833
<i>That's it, isn't it?</i>

29:45.083 --> 29:48.000
<i>All creatures searching</i>
<i>for a place to belong.</i>

29:49.958 --> 29:51.291
<i>To call home.</i>

29:52.625 --> 29:55.333
As for me, I am the Watcher.

29:55.916 --> 30:01.000
The Multiverse, every single world,
every story is my home,

30:01.083 --> 30:04.333
and I will protect it to the end.

30:47.458 --> 30:49.041
I'm too fast.

30:51.291 --> 30:53.041
Don't tell me, he was your type?

30:53.125 --> 30:55.875
Oh, Widow, I've never been
so happy to see you.

30:55.958 --> 30:58.041
Did you hit your head or something?

30:58.125 --> 30:59.875
A few times, actually.

30:59.958 --> 31:02.875
Shake it off. You'll need
all your marbles for this one.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.333
I found what the pirates were after.

31:07.125 --> 31:10.375
Peggy, you might wanna brace yourself.

31:10.458 --> 31:11.791
I can promise you, Nat,

31:11.875 --> 31:14.291
this won't be the strangest thing
I've dealt with today.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.291
Famous last words.

31:21.375 --> 31:23.000
The HYDRA Stomper?

31:23.083 --> 31:26.500
Yeah, and there's someone inside.
