WEBVTT

02:33.667 --> 02:36.124
Time for action!

02:37.792 --> 02:38.792
Gangrene,

02:38.958 --> 02:40.744
you slime ball.

02:42.042 --> 02:43.248
Hands up!

03:05.833 --> 03:08.700
Gangrene, you slime ball.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.082
- Hey, Thomas.
- Hi, Brian.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.039
- How was school?
- Fine.

03:18.375 --> 03:19.490
Good.

03:35.083 --> 03:36.994
Time's up, you slime ball!

03:37.292 --> 03:38.657
Lets go outside.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.289
I'm almost done.

03:41.208 --> 03:43.290
Come on, mum, you promised.

03:43.458 --> 03:45.995
I know and I am a terrible mother.

03:46.167 --> 03:48.658
- You're horrible.
- Horrible?

03:49.125 --> 03:51.241
- You're dreadful.
- Dreadful?

03:53.417 --> 03:58.081
I will be horrible and dreadful
if I don't finish this chapter.

03:58.417 --> 04:01.033
So, I need at least...

04:01.375 --> 04:02.410
Five minutes

04:02.708 --> 04:03.743
three?

04:04.625 --> 04:05.625
Four.

04:05.792 --> 04:08.078
Deal! We're escaping outside.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.580
Hey.

04:30.917 --> 04:31.997
Hey.

04:33.875 --> 04:35.206
What did they say?

04:38.083 --> 04:39.493
Not interested.

04:41.125 --> 04:43.912
What do they know?
They rejected my first novel anyway.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.499
It's Tabitha king syndrome.

04:48.208 --> 04:49.789
Stephen King's wife.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.912
She's a good enough writer,
but no one knows her.

04:54.625 --> 04:57.788
All they know is Stephen King.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.248
They'll know you one day.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.286
Look at all the help
you've given me.

05:05.458 --> 05:07.744
That's editing, darling,
it's not the same thing.

05:09.417 --> 05:10.497
See.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.999
"Not sufficiently mysterious
for a mystery,

05:13.958 --> 05:16.165
nor sufficiently thrilling
for a thriller."

05:20.917 --> 05:22.077
You know,

05:22.375 --> 05:24.991
it wouldn't be the worst thing

05:25.167 --> 05:26.532
to add a few thrills

05:26.708 --> 05:30.200
- and resubmit it.
- What? Throw in some more blood?

05:30.708 --> 05:33.165
Psychopath jumping out
of the closet with an axe?

05:34.208 --> 05:36.324
No, it's not
the english tradition.

05:36.917 --> 05:39.533
Our authors have style, wit...

05:41.250 --> 05:42.330
Imagination.

05:43.083 --> 05:44.539
Darling, you have wit.

05:45.375 --> 05:46.490
Very good.

05:47.083 --> 05:49.995
You're the best editor in London.
Is that so bad?

05:50.417 --> 05:51.417
Max Perkins

05:51.583 --> 05:53.039
saved Hemingway.

05:53.208 --> 05:56.325
Well, no one remembers
Max Perkins and he's right up there

05:56.667 --> 05:58.328
with Tabitha what's her face.

06:00.375 --> 06:02.741
Well, I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

06:05.125 --> 06:07.036
Well, you do realise,
darling, that...

06:10.583 --> 06:12.665
That I'm supposed
to be saying that to you.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.490
Hey, when can I read some?

06:20.042 --> 06:23.409
In about three minutes?
That's all Thomas has given me.

06:23.625 --> 06:26.207
Okay, three minutes it is.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.949
Action alert!

06:52.458 --> 06:53.868
Hands up!

08:36.707 --> 08:37.788
Action alert,

08:38.957 --> 08:40.494
hands up!

09:14.750 --> 09:15.910
Brian,

09:16.333 --> 09:17.823
dinner's ready.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.539
Yeah, coming.

09:23.292 --> 09:24.657
Thomas?

09:28.417 --> 09:29.907
Thomas?

10:00.250 --> 10:01.456
Thomas?

10:03.583 --> 10:04.583
Thomas?

10:13.875 --> 10:15.035
Thomas?

10:48.333 --> 10:49.333
Thomas!

10:50.000 --> 10:51.115
No!

10:51.875 --> 10:53.490
Oh, baby...

10:53.667 --> 10:55.032
Brian!

10:55.458 --> 10:56.458
Come on!

10:59.458 --> 11:01.494
Come on, breathe!

11:02.500 --> 11:03.831
Brian!

11:34.500 --> 11:36.240
No!

12:51.542 --> 12:53.658
I searched every website.

12:54.917 --> 12:56.498
This is everything you want.

12:56.667 --> 12:59.500
It's remote, quiet,
no one around

12:59.667 --> 13:01.908
- for miles.
- Ingonish cove.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.665
You'll get so much
writing done. Look,

13:04.833 --> 13:06.476
it's even got the boats
we used in Suffolk.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.180
Do you know how long
you might want it for?

13:08.750 --> 13:09.990
I don't know.

13:10.458 --> 13:12.790
Just whatever it takes
for me to finish this book.

13:14.750 --> 13:15.910
It looks great.

13:16.542 --> 13:18.624
Well, Brian hasn't been any help.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.575
- He should have been there for you.
- Yeah, well...

13:23.583 --> 13:25.824
He tried.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.707
Look, whatever we had
we lost a long time ago.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.331
Yeah, I know.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.508
But are you really going
to be okay out there,

13:33.667 --> 13:35.953
all by yourself?
It's only been 8 months.

13:36.167 --> 13:37.873
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:41.583 --> 13:43.119
Would you like to get some tea?

13:43.917 --> 13:44.997
Yep.

13:52.542 --> 13:56.160
I'll get you wherever you are!

15:38.958 --> 15:41.825
If you're really going to go,
take these with you.

15:43.375 --> 15:47.038
You know I was wanting to try it
without it for a while, Robert.

15:47.208 --> 15:48.869
It's just in case.

15:55.208 --> 15:56.539
Rachel?

16:03.458 --> 16:04.948
Shall I call bartlett?

16:05.208 --> 16:07.745
I'm not up for
divorce lawyers right now.

16:08.917 --> 16:11.533
Let's just deal with all that
when I get back.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.874
- So how did it go?
- You know, all this time,

16:20.875 --> 16:22.490
she's never talked
to me about Thomas.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.081
She won't open up to me at all.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.619
You've got to remember
it's not the same for you.

16:29.792 --> 16:31.578
What? Because he's not my son?

16:31.750 --> 16:34.287
Because you weren't the one
who left the gate open.

16:44.208 --> 16:46.369
- Hello.
- Rachel how are you?

16:46.958 --> 16:49.165
You should see
where I am right now.

16:49.333 --> 16:50.698
You're there already?

16:50.917 --> 16:53.033
It's beautiful and
there's not another house

16:53.208 --> 16:54.664
around for miles.

16:55.208 --> 16:57.415
They said there was
a lighthouse there as well?

16:57.625 --> 16:59.225
You've got one
in your book, haven't you?

16:59.333 --> 17:00.948
You can do some research.

17:01.125 --> 17:04.037
It's perfect.
It's exactly what I wanted.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.991
If I can't write here
I can't write anywhere.

17:08.125 --> 17:10.161
At least you're not
stuck writing crap.

17:10.583 --> 17:11.789
For a crap paper,

17:11.958 --> 17:13.289
like I am.

17:13.541 --> 17:15.156
It's not that bad.

17:15.375 --> 17:17.205
It keeps the bills at bay.

17:18.291 --> 17:19.406
Almost.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.118
Yeah, which is good for you.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.161
Which I don't need reminding.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.374
Hey, remember, if you want me
to come out there,

17:28.541 --> 17:29.702
you just say the word.

17:29.875 --> 17:30.990
Thanks. I...

17:31.167 --> 17:33.704
I'm going to be okay.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.582
I really think
I'm going to be okay.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.081
Excuse me.

17:57.250 --> 18:00.037
Excuse me, am I headed
the right way into town?

18:00.208 --> 18:01.288
Sorry?

18:01.875 --> 18:04.491
Am I...? Sorry...

18:05.917 --> 18:08.124
Am I headed
the right way into town?

18:08.542 --> 18:10.309
Yeah, just follow up
the beach, you can't miss it.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.244
Okay, wasn't sure.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.033
- Are you travelling through?
- Oh, no, no.

18:15.333 --> 18:18.291
Actually I've just moved in
to foster road, number 1.

18:18.458 --> 18:20.198
Foster road, number 1?
Are you sure?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.286
I think so,
it's the only house on the road.

18:24.417 --> 18:25.532
Yeah, that's it.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.698
I'm Finlay Murray.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.616
What passes for a police sergeant
round here.

18:30.792 --> 18:31.907
And I'm Mary.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.869
Hello. Rachel Carlson.

18:34.208 --> 18:37.120
- So, you're here on your own?
- Yeah.

18:37.292 --> 18:40.250
Hang on and I'll give you a lift in.
It's a wee bit of a hike.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.913
Thank you but...
This is what I'm here for.

18:44.083 --> 18:45.493
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

18:47.125 --> 18:47.659
To the beach?

18:47.833 --> 18:49.448
- Yes.
- All right.

18:49.625 --> 18:50.831
Thank you.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.250
Who's that?

19:45.292 --> 19:46.953
Your son's waiting for you.

19:49.917 --> 19:51.248
On the swings.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.954
He's been waiting for you,
he told me.

19:56.125 --> 19:57.331
My son?

20:01.417 --> 20:02.702
I'm sorry...

20:04.083 --> 20:05.843
It must have been
some one else's little boy.

20:10.625 --> 20:11.865
Wait.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.493
Can I talk to you?

20:14.625 --> 20:16.456
I was mistaken, that's all.

20:21.958 --> 20:24.040
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

21:09.458 --> 21:10.823
Mum?

21:11.792 --> 21:13.908
We're escaping outside,
come with us.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.911
You promised,
but you never came.

22:51.458 --> 22:53.449
It's impressive,
don't you think?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.080
Quite.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.033
I didn't realise that
there was anyone else around.

22:58.833 --> 23:01.996
Carry on,
lighthouses are a dying breed.

23:08.083 --> 23:10.790
I'm Angus McCulloch,
the lighthouse keeper.

23:11.458 --> 23:12.664
Rachel.

23:13.875 --> 23:17.993
Sorry, I just assumed that
all lighthouses were automated now.

23:18.500 --> 23:21.867
Well most of them are.
In a few years I'll be gone too.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.161
So what brings you out here?
I'm...

23:27.667 --> 23:29.623
Researching lighthouses for a book.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.283
It's a long way from America
just to see a lighthouse.

23:33.292 --> 23:35.954
No. I live in London actually.

23:36.208 --> 23:38.540
I'm just out here
doing some writing.

23:40.625 --> 23:41.956
You're in the cottage?

23:42.958 --> 23:44.494
It's about time someone moved in.

23:45.125 --> 23:46.581
It's been empty for years.

23:47.625 --> 23:51.664
Well, you've certainly come to
the right place to write a book.

23:52.958 --> 23:54.414
Did you meet the horses yet?

23:57.792 --> 23:59.202
That's a story for you.

24:00.083 --> 24:04.827
A Spanish galleon shipwrecked,
right there, 1754.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.411
The entire crew died.

24:08.208 --> 24:10.540
But a few horses
swam here to safety.

24:11.708 --> 24:13.494
And they've been here ever since.

24:15.042 --> 24:16.907
And they've never
been off the island?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.248
I can think of worse.

24:24.125 --> 24:25.331
Yeah.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.912
Listen, I'm just putting some
dinner on. You're welcome to stay.

24:29.125 --> 24:30.740
Have something to eat.

24:30.958 --> 24:33.665
I can tell you everything you need
to know about lighthouses.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.787
Thanks, I need to get back.

24:36.958 --> 24:39.244
I'm still unpacking boxes.

24:39.417 --> 24:41.282
Well, look, maybe next week?

24:41.958 --> 24:43.368
Same time?

24:44.042 --> 24:48.115
I'll cook some extra and if you
don't show I'll eat with the horses.

24:49.417 --> 24:50.998
We should be friends.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.077
We're neighbours now.

24:56.292 --> 24:57.372
We should.

26:25.292 --> 26:28.125
To my love, in honour of
what we decided yesterday.

26:29.417 --> 26:31.203
Forever yours, Kay.

26:33.167 --> 26:35.909
Page 145, line 7.

26:37.833 --> 26:40.905
Today I begin to understand
what love must be,

26:41.792 --> 26:43.032
if it exists.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.535
When we are parted,

26:45.875 --> 26:49.038
we each feel the lack
of the other half of ourselves.

26:50.125 --> 26:52.241
We are incomplete.

26:52.458 --> 26:54.119
Like a book in two volumes

26:54.292 --> 26:56.578
of which the first has been lost,

26:58.125 --> 27:00.332
this is what I imagine love to be.

27:01.333 --> 27:04.040
Incompleteness in absence.

27:22.083 --> 27:23.539
I'l get you,

27:23.708 --> 27:26.165
wherever you are!

28:03.708 --> 28:04.993
Thomas?

28:19.917 --> 28:21.157
Thomas.

28:23.708 --> 28:24.993
Mama.

28:27.250 --> 28:28.911
It's okay, mum.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.073
Don't go.

28:32.042 --> 28:34.078
- Don't go.
- I won't.

28:41.875 --> 28:43.706
Come, be with me.

30:45.583 --> 30:46.618
Hello.

30:47.292 --> 30:48.953
You turned up at last.

30:49.333 --> 30:51.369
Good timing,
I'm just burning the fish.

30:52.667 --> 30:53.998
It's good to see you.

30:54.167 --> 30:57.079
- How's your research coming?
- Well, it's alright.

30:57.250 --> 30:59.036
Could be better.

30:59.208 --> 31:01.059
That's why I'm here.
I was hoping I could get a tour.

31:01.083 --> 31:02.118
Okay.

31:04.375 --> 31:05.615
How about some lunch

31:05.792 --> 31:06.952
before the tour?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.907
Is there anything else
on the menu?

31:12.375 --> 31:14.161
Why is it that everyone
paints their boats

31:14.458 --> 31:16.164
the exact same colour
as their houses?

31:18.583 --> 31:21.370
Well, that's actually
a tradition here.

31:22.167 --> 31:24.624
The wife needs to be able
to look out on the water.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.078
And know her husbands okay.

31:29.250 --> 31:30.490
That's very romantic.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.199
And we also get
a tax break on the paint.

31:35.958 --> 31:37.949
Which is also very romantic.

31:39.167 --> 31:40.657
Very romantic.

31:45.833 --> 31:47.414
I'm not going to make it!

31:52.250 --> 31:53.490
Quick.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.957
Do you ever get lonely
working out here?

32:02.375 --> 32:05.162
You never get lonely
sitting at your typewriter?

32:08.167 --> 32:09.407
Sometimes.

32:10.417 --> 32:12.078
I like being alone.

32:15.625 --> 32:17.115
Do you really like it?

32:18.125 --> 32:21.162
Or do you think it's just
something you've gotten used to?

32:22.458 --> 32:24.119
Or maybe I like it

32:24.292 --> 32:25.782
because I've got used to it.

32:27.708 --> 32:28.993
I love it out here.

32:29.542 --> 32:30.827
Who do you talk to?

32:32.292 --> 32:33.702
Who do you talk to?

32:34.833 --> 32:38.075
Isn't that what you love
about writing? The solitude?

32:39.917 --> 32:41.407
I write because...

32:44.167 --> 32:45.202
Well,

32:45.792 --> 32:49.205
I don't function very well as
a human being unless I'm writing.

32:50.958 --> 32:53.415
Well, what are you writing now?

32:58.208 --> 32:59.243
I'm not.

33:06.667 --> 33:07.907
Don't tell me

33:08.083 --> 33:09.289
you paint as well!

33:12.250 --> 33:13.365
No.

33:16.125 --> 33:17.786
Kate, my wife.

33:19.708 --> 33:20.708
She...

33:22.583 --> 33:25.040
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

33:26.625 --> 33:28.365
She loved it out here at first.

33:30.667 --> 33:34.034
But in the end the isolation
was too much for her.

33:36.375 --> 33:39.162
Loneliness can make you
a little crazy, I think.

33:44.042 --> 33:45.202
Come on.

33:54.208 --> 33:55.208
Wow.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.832
Kate could never understand
why I wouldn't leave here.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.831
And his father before him.

34:09.125 --> 34:12.743
My great-grandfather,
he built the balcony

34:13.958 --> 34:16.540
from wood that was washed
ashore from a shipwreck.

34:19.333 --> 34:20.539
This is him.

34:24.083 --> 34:25.539
I could never leave here.

34:27.083 --> 34:28.414
You'll see why.

34:29.583 --> 34:30.663
Come on.

35:24.792 --> 35:26.077
By the way,

35:26.250 --> 35:28.491
I've brought you something

35:28.708 --> 35:30.949
as a thank you for the tour.

35:31.125 --> 35:32.865
It's one of my books.

35:33.875 --> 35:35.581
- I had it sent.
- Thanks.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.704
"Dreamers awake",
by Rachel Carlson.

35:40.292 --> 35:41.577
I'm impressed.

35:43.083 --> 35:44.573
Is it a comedy or a tragedy?

35:45.250 --> 35:46.956
Well, it's a mystery.

35:48.208 --> 35:51.871
But please be kind, it is
the first novel I had published.

35:52.042 --> 35:53.282
Well,

35:55.208 --> 35:56.539
I'll find out all about you.

35:58.208 --> 35:59.414
Maybe.

36:04.542 --> 36:07.534
If you need any help,
just send out a flare.

36:08.542 --> 36:09.782
I'll keep an eye out for you.

36:09.958 --> 36:11.448
Thank you. I really...

36:11.917 --> 36:13.999
I really enjoyed that today.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.910
Aye, me too.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.707
So, have you slept with him yet?

37:55.167 --> 37:57.579
It's just nice
to have someone to talk to.

37:58.458 --> 38:01.200
- Meaning you haven't slept with him?
- You know, you're starting

38:01.375 --> 38:04.742
to sound like you're
conducting a tabloid interview,

38:04.917 --> 38:05.952
my friend.

38:06.125 --> 38:08.081
You know me, always working.

38:08.417 --> 38:10.578
Always looking for the angle.
And you know

38:10.750 --> 38:12.490
I rely on you for my kicks.

38:15.292 --> 38:16.782
Is that the sea I can hear?

38:16.958 --> 38:18.823
Yes, it's...

38:19.500 --> 38:22.367
Less than ten feet away.
Can you hear the crashing?

38:22.542 --> 38:23.748
Wow, look at you.

38:24.458 --> 38:27.291
Number one best sellers,
waves at your feet,

38:27.500 --> 38:30.537
romance on a deserted island.
Tough life!

38:34.125 --> 38:37.117
Rachel, I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

38:37.292 --> 38:38.372
Sharon, forget it.

38:39.208 --> 38:41.699
It's okay.
Look, I wouldn't have made it

38:41.958 --> 38:44.415
this far without you. I mean it,

38:45.000 --> 38:46.661
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

38:48.208 --> 38:49.414
Okay.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.786
Okay, don't peek.

39:05.958 --> 39:07.278
Quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick!

39:08.250 --> 39:09.456
- What?
- Quick, quick.

39:09.750 --> 39:10.750
Ready?

39:12.250 --> 39:13.911
Ready?

39:18.333 --> 39:19.948
And no faces this time.

39:20.500 --> 39:22.411
Right, hurry, hurry. Look.

39:22.833 --> 39:24.744
Wait. It's gonna come.

39:25.833 --> 39:26.993
Smiling?

39:27.167 --> 39:28.532
Yes, - you promise?

39:28.708 --> 39:29.743
Yes, - you promise?

39:35.583 --> 39:36.743
Rachel?

39:37.292 --> 39:38.657
Are you okay?

39:41.167 --> 39:42.373
Rachel?

39:44.792 --> 39:46.282
Is something wrong?

39:46.750 --> 39:48.365
What's wrong?

39:50.667 --> 39:52.407
I think I need to get back.

39:55.375 --> 39:56.660
Why?

40:01.958 --> 40:03.198
I'm sorry.

40:27.833 --> 40:30.074
- Afternoon, Rachel.
- Afternoon.

40:30.667 --> 40:32.453
Are we going
to see you here on Sunday?

40:33.042 --> 40:35.829
I don't think so. Your man
and I are not on very good terms.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.072
Don't you worry about that.
All the more reason to come.

40:40.750 --> 40:41.830
Your cross is broken.

40:43.792 --> 40:44.827
I know.

40:45.583 --> 40:47.323
It's this weekend's chore.

41:07.792 --> 41:08.872
It's the gate,

41:09.042 --> 41:10.042
isn't it?

41:12.917 --> 41:13.952
What?

41:15.125 --> 41:16.831
Why you're so sad.

41:18.375 --> 41:20.115
You left the gate open.

41:36.417 --> 41:37.857
You haven't been able
to go out there

41:37.917 --> 41:39.373
since he died, have you?

41:39.708 --> 41:40.868
Alright, ready?

41:41.583 --> 41:44.325
Alright, here we go.

41:44.625 --> 41:46.957
Now face this way. Okay. Good,

41:48.958 --> 41:50.243
okay, let's smile.

41:50.417 --> 41:51.532
Smile.

41:52.458 --> 41:54.289
He's beside you, your son.

41:55.625 --> 41:57.035
He's dripping wet.

41:58.042 --> 41:59.703
He follows you everywhere.

42:02.208 --> 42:03.448
He's trying to hold

42:03.625 --> 42:04.660
your hand.

42:18.167 --> 42:19.577
What's she been saying?

42:19.833 --> 42:21.949
More of her psychic mumbo jumbo?

42:22.458 --> 42:25.700
She'll say anything to get
somebody to talk to her.

42:26.042 --> 42:27.452
Watch your fingers.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.740
Jim, get us
that dustpan and brush.

42:38.500 --> 42:39.740
Yes, yes, I can hear her.

42:40.917 --> 42:42.437
- I'm not answering.
- Is anybody here?

42:43.042 --> 42:44.828
I should never
have gone to see her.

42:52.833 --> 42:54.698
I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

42:55.125 --> 42:56.240
I'm not listening.

42:57.458 --> 42:59.699
You can keep talking
but I'm not listening.

43:00.458 --> 43:03.370
I'm not getting out of this chair
for the love of god or money.

43:05.333 --> 43:06.823
I can't save her.

43:08.917 --> 43:10.657
I can't save anyone.

43:12.083 --> 43:14.074
Things are going to get worse.

43:53.958 --> 43:54.958
Rachel!

43:55.833 --> 43:57.198
Comeiin.

43:59.625 --> 44:01.411
Do you think it's possible?

44:02.750 --> 44:05.332
Do you think I could
be getting messages from him?

44:06.250 --> 44:07.865
I don't know.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.115
Maybe...

44:12.333 --> 44:16.201
Maybe the dead miss us,
even more than we miss them.

44:17.625 --> 44:19.616
I've replayed it so many times.

44:21.250 --> 44:24.742
If I'd only gone out to play
with him, like I said I would,

44:25.125 --> 44:27.116
this never would have happened.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.831
And I keep thinking of him

44:33.583 --> 44:36.825
in the water struggling
and I wasn't there.

44:39.833 --> 44:41.369
I'm the mother.

44:41.583 --> 44:44.450
I'm supposed to be there
to protect him, and I wasn't.

44:53.625 --> 44:55.786
I came here thinking
that I could write

44:56.250 --> 44:57.660
and that everything would be okay.

44:57.833 --> 44:59.789
And you know what, it's not okay.

45:00.542 --> 45:02.828
- It's not okay and I'm not okay.
- Rachel...

46:30.917 --> 46:32.157
What is this?

46:32.833 --> 46:34.824
It's an old Celtic ballad.

46:35.208 --> 46:38.871
"Caelleach an airgid".
"Girl in the storm".

46:39.875 --> 46:41.240
It's beautiful.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.661
I finished your book.

46:47.042 --> 46:49.078
Did you learn all about me?

46:50.667 --> 46:51.998
Maybe.

46:55.833 --> 46:56.993
Here,

46:59.583 --> 47:01.164
I made something for you.

47:04.042 --> 47:05.373
To inspire you.

47:17.917 --> 47:19.657
I'll leave a key out for you.

47:23.708 --> 47:25.289
So you can come up
whenever you want to.

47:26.500 --> 47:28.286
In case I'm out
fishing or something.

47:41.500 --> 47:42.785
Look,

47:43.333 --> 47:45.073
it's mother of Pearl.

47:47.083 --> 47:48.539
I love these,

47:49.792 --> 47:51.953
do you know the old
Celtic legend about them?

47:52.625 --> 47:54.331
- About those?
- Yeah.

47:55.542 --> 47:56.577
No.

47:58.542 --> 47:59.577
Come on.

48:04.625 --> 48:06.707
First, we have to...

48:07.458 --> 48:08.948
Bury it together.

48:13.042 --> 48:14.998
- Together.
- Right.

48:15.750 --> 48:19.447
And then if one of us
ever returns and digs it up,

48:20.583 --> 48:21.663
then...

48:21.875 --> 48:23.786
Then we were meant
for each other?

48:25.500 --> 48:28.367
Well actually, I don't know
because I just made it up.

48:29.542 --> 48:31.157
Very Celtic of you.

48:31.667 --> 48:35.080
You know, I was thinking
that exact same thing.

48:39.792 --> 48:42.499
Do you know Mary, Finlay's wife?

48:43.458 --> 48:46.416
She's having a little birthday
thing in the village tomorrow and...

48:46.583 --> 48:48.198
You know, I was thinking that...

48:48.375 --> 48:50.491
Maybe you'd like to go?

48:55.167 --> 48:56.407
I'd love to go.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.456
So like...

49:00.208 --> 49:01.618
Two o'clock?

49:02.375 --> 49:03.581
Two.

49:12.500 --> 49:13.990
Hey, Rachel?

49:22.375 --> 49:23.831
I'll see you tomorrow.

49:40.208 --> 49:41.368
Two, right!

50:25.958 --> 50:27.789
She lay there,

50:27.958 --> 50:31.405
in the half light
of the cabin unable to sleep.

50:33.375 --> 50:35.912
In the morning
she told him she had.

50:37.125 --> 50:40.663
There were still some limits to the
things she could say to him then.

50:41.833 --> 50:46.782
But most of the night she watched
his eyelids, his lips and his face.

50:48.750 --> 50:50.365
And in the stillness...

50:51.833 --> 50:53.573
She felt peace.

51:43.583 --> 51:45.119
- Hey, Rachel. How you doing?
- Hello.

51:45.292 --> 51:46.702
All right?

51:46.875 --> 51:48.831
Rachel, you made it!

51:49.000 --> 51:50.160
Oh, great.

51:51.167 --> 51:52.559
- There you go, honey.
- Thank you, pet.

51:52.583 --> 51:54.263
I've got something for you.
Happy birthday.

51:54.417 --> 51:57.033
That's so sweet of you,
thanks very much.

51:57.500 --> 51:58.831
Would you like a drink?

51:59.500 --> 52:01.741
- A lager.
- It's on the way.

52:45.625 --> 52:47.581
Rachel, your glass is empty.

52:48.917 --> 52:50.782
Happy birthday to you...

52:50.958 --> 52:54.450
Happy birthday to you...

52:54.875 --> 52:58.322
Happy birthday, dear Mary...

52:58.917 --> 53:02.614
Happy birthday to you.

53:05.667 --> 53:06.667
Thank you.

53:32.542 --> 53:33.748
Excuse me, Mary,

53:34.292 --> 53:35.998
I'm sorry to interrupt.

53:36.333 --> 53:39.530
I'm meeting a friend here.
Angus McCulloch.

53:39.708 --> 53:40.993
I thought you might

53:41.167 --> 53:42.967
- have seen him?
- What are you talking about?

53:43.833 --> 53:46.415
Well, he was supposed
to be here an hour ago.

53:47.042 --> 53:48.202
The lighthouse keeper?

53:48.375 --> 53:50.661
Aye, I know who he is.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.956
What does he look like,
your Angus?

53:57.250 --> 54:00.162
Dark hair, nice blue eyes...

54:00.542 --> 54:02.032
Aye, that sounds like Angus.

54:02.917 --> 54:05.124
But I've not seen him
these seven years.

54:05.583 --> 54:07.323
And neither have you
because he's dead.

54:08.542 --> 54:10.999
No, there must be some mistake.

54:11.208 --> 54:13.665
He's dead alright,
him and the wife.

54:14.250 --> 54:16.457
I chose the dress
we buried her in.

54:17.583 --> 54:18.698
No...

54:19.542 --> 54:20.873
You're kidding, right?

54:25.708 --> 54:26.788
Reverend,

54:27.417 --> 54:29.453
you've been out
to lighthouse, haven't you?

54:29.625 --> 54:32.617
No, not for years. Nobody goes

54:32.792 --> 54:35.864
- out there anymore.
- But, you know Angus McCulloch.

54:36.583 --> 54:39.620
I used to, aye, but...
He's been dead

54:39.792 --> 54:41.999
for six, no, seven years.

54:47.333 --> 54:49.574
- Is this a joke?
- Rachel,

54:50.167 --> 54:51.532
this isn't funny.

54:51.833 --> 54:53.994
People here
don't laugh about this.

55:05.042 --> 55:06.373
What is this?

55:10.750 --> 55:12.741
Why are you doing this?

55:14.958 --> 55:16.573
Why are you doing this?

55:21.042 --> 55:22.373
This is...

56:46.875 --> 56:47.955
Angus?

57:20.083 --> 57:21.414
Loneliness

57:21.625 --> 57:23.331
can make you
a little crazy, I think.

57:42.542 --> 57:45.284
Kate could never understand
why I wouldn't leave here.

57:47.750 --> 57:49.490
But my father lived here.

57:50.625 --> 57:52.365
And his father before him.

57:58.083 --> 57:59.744
I could never leave here,

58:09.792 --> 58:10.998
Maybe the dead

58:11.167 --> 58:14.000
miss us even more
than we miss them.

58:28.083 --> 58:29.289
Rachel.

58:32.167 --> 58:33.782
What are you doing here?

58:34.167 --> 58:35.907
You're going to stir up trouble.

58:36.875 --> 58:38.331
I came to look for Angus.

58:38.500 --> 58:41.287
Angus McCulloch is dead

58:41.500 --> 58:42.865
and buried.

58:43.833 --> 58:46.415
I saw him jump off
that cliff over there.

58:47.875 --> 58:50.537
I was with him,
right here, last night.

58:50.792 --> 58:52.202
You couldn't have been.

58:53.958 --> 58:55.949
Seven years ago,

58:56.208 --> 58:58.039
I came out to visit Angus,

58:58.792 --> 59:01.909
just as I had done
dozens of times before.

59:05.333 --> 59:06.914
There was a tape playing.

59:07.208 --> 59:10.280
âCaelleach an airgid".
Angus's favourite song.

59:12.917 --> 59:14.623
I found Kate inside.

59:19.708 --> 59:22.040
Angus came home
early from the village.

59:23.083 --> 59:25.324
Caught her in bed
with a local fisherman.

59:26.500 --> 59:28.161
Gordon mcloud.

59:30.125 --> 59:31.911
It had been going on for months.

59:33.083 --> 59:35.745
Angus was the only one that
didn't know anything about it.

59:37.083 --> 59:40.246
I caught a glimpse of him,
through the window.

59:41.750 --> 59:44.867
I followed him up to the balcony,
but I was too late.

59:47.958 --> 59:50.825
I felt for him. We all did.

59:52.833 --> 59:54.869
He just worshipped Kate.

59:55.833 --> 59:57.573
When he caught her with Gordon,

59:58.333 --> 01:00:00.164
he must have just snapped.

01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:03.990
I heard all this from Kate.

01:00:04.708 --> 01:00:06.539
She lived long enough to tell me

01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:07.788
that Angus didn't kill her.

01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:10.615
She came between them
in the struggle.

01:00:11.917 --> 01:00:13.657
Just before she died,

01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:16.119
she prayed that Angus
would forgive her.

01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:21.994
We all knew what was going on.

01:00:22.958 --> 01:00:24.619
Nobody said anything.

01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:29.447
Those three deaths are as much
on our hands as they are on his.

01:00:32.417 --> 01:00:34.499
It just can't be the same man.

01:00:39.625 --> 01:00:43.447
I can prove he was here.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.241
If I can just
get this film developed.

01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:54.782
There's a photo of us together.

01:00:55.042 --> 01:00:56.452
And...

01:01:01.042 --> 01:01:02.452
I...

01:01:02.708 --> 01:01:03.993
I must have just misplaced

01:01:04.167 --> 01:01:07.204
- the film somewhere.
- You couldn't have met anyone there.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:11.823
He also did a carving for me that...

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:12.830
Rachel.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.082
- Was right here.
- Rachel.

01:01:15.292 --> 01:01:16.998
Nobody goes out there anymore.

01:01:17.958 --> 01:01:21.075
The lighthouse was automated after
the murders so we wouldn't have to.

01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:23.449
And nobody's lived
in this house since then, either.

01:01:24.833 --> 01:01:26.414
What do you mean, "this house"?

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:29.744
Well, this was
Gordon mcloud's house.

01:01:32.958 --> 01:01:35.540
He and Kate used to signal
each other with lights

01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:36.948
when Angus was away.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.115
This who you mean?

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.161
This just doesn't make any sense.

01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:13.166
I've been with him practically
every day this last month.

01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:17.076
We've eaten together, walked on
the beach, been with the horses...

01:02:17.792 --> 01:02:21.455
It's not like I've been out there
talking to myself all this time.

01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:25.616
Well, if you've been flirting
with Angus McCulloch,

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:29.082
who's that buried
in ingonish cemetery?

01:03:36.708 --> 01:03:38.244
You didn't believe us, eh?

01:03:38.708 --> 01:03:40.949
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:46.706
You still haven't fixed the cross.

01:03:48.375 --> 01:03:49.410
No.

01:03:49.583 --> 01:03:51.119
No, I haven't.

01:04:00.875 --> 01:04:02.786
It's this weekend's chore.

01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:36.539
Excuse me.

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:39.866
You have some newspapers
missing on the microfilm.

01:04:40.292 --> 01:04:42.203
It's a miracle
we have any there at all.

01:04:42.458 --> 01:04:43.914
What you looking for?

01:04:44.417 --> 01:04:47.739
Anything around
February 12 or 13, 1998.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.623
The McCulloch murder?

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:53.913
Kids probably pinched them.
Gory murders. Kids love them.

01:04:56.542 --> 01:04:59.409
What about Internet access...?

01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:08.448
The computer's being fixed.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.160
Sorry.

01:05:14.875 --> 01:05:16.081
Look...

01:05:17.958 --> 01:05:21.780
I just need anything that
has a photo of Angus McCulloch.

01:05:22.917 --> 01:05:24.999
Try ullapool public library.

01:05:36.292 --> 01:05:38.453
You have reached
ullapool public library.

01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:42.242
We are closed at this time
and will reopen on Monday at 9.

01:05:54.333 --> 01:05:56.324
- He wasn't there?
- No.

01:05:56.583 --> 01:05:59.655
I don't understand. His stuff,
his boat, must have been there.

01:05:59.833 --> 01:06:03.906
No. Nothing was there.
It was like he never existed.

01:06:04.083 --> 01:06:05.823
There must be some explanation.

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:07.493
Yeah.

01:06:08.167 --> 01:06:11.284
Like I'm losing it.
That's the explanation.

01:06:13.417 --> 01:06:14.998
Maybe I shouldn't have come here.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.866
- Have you spoken to Robert?
- No.

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:21.745
Maybe he was right and I shouldn't
have gone off the medication.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.207
Rachel, just come home.

01:06:24.458 --> 01:06:26.619
Just get out of there
and come back,

01:06:28.167 --> 01:06:30.624
you know what,
maybe I did imagine Angus.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.786
He seemed so perfect...

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:37.661
And there isn't
anything that perfect.

01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:38.913
Is there?

01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:40.869
Listen, I'm coming to you.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:43.749
I'll get on the next plane
and I'll be there in a few hours.

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:47.947
You just sit tight.
You stay there, okay?

01:06:49.042 --> 01:06:50.077
Okay.

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:52.206
I'll see you soon.

01:09:57.167 --> 01:09:58.167
Rachel!

01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:01.331
What are you doing here?

01:10:03.083 --> 01:10:04.163
I knew you'd be here.

01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:08.581
Rachel!

01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:11.240
Come down and meet me inside.

01:10:16.042 --> 01:10:17.248
Sharon?

01:10:17.833 --> 01:10:19.744
- He's here. Angus.
- What?

01:10:19.917 --> 01:10:21.202
He was on the balcony.

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:23.453
I saw him, then I saw you,
and then he was gone.

01:10:23.625 --> 01:10:24.785
You didn't see him.

01:10:24.958 --> 01:10:26.448
You didn't see anything.

01:10:26.625 --> 01:10:28.866
- Your mind's playing tricks on you.
- No. No, no.

01:10:29.042 --> 01:10:30.703
Come on, let's go home.

01:10:35.083 --> 01:10:36.914
Sharon, he's right there,
in the doorway.

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:38.163
There's no one there.

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:40.590
- Turn around.
- I am not going to turn around.

01:10:40.667 --> 01:10:42.703
I'm not buying
into this fantasy.

01:10:42.958 --> 01:10:44.949
There's nobody there.

01:10:46.167 --> 01:10:47.407
Listen to me.

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:49.698
I want you to do something for me.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.365
Close your eyes.

01:10:51.625 --> 01:10:52.625
Do this.

01:10:52.792 --> 01:10:55.329
Close your eyes.
And when you open them again,

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.785
he'll be gone.

01:10:57.333 --> 01:10:58.573
You have to do this.

01:10:59.083 --> 01:11:00.289
You make him go away now,

01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:02.574
and he'll never come back again.

01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:04.664
Close your eyes.

01:11:06.792 --> 01:11:08.123
Close your eyes.

01:11:10.542 --> 01:11:11.782
And now he'll be gone.

01:11:18.417 --> 01:11:20.032
He's coming towards us.

01:11:24.458 --> 01:11:25.914
He's right behind you.

01:11:29.958 --> 01:11:32.620
See? Nothing.

01:11:33.792 --> 01:11:34.792
Nothing.

01:11:37.583 --> 01:11:38.743
Can we go now?

01:12:02.917 --> 01:12:04.953
Legs eleven.
We have legs eleven.

01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:07.368
Now what about one

01:12:07.542 --> 01:12:09.453
and six, it's sweet sixteen.

01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:11.402
We'll not see that again, will we?

01:12:13.833 --> 01:12:15.243
And the next number is

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:17.115
88. Two fat ladies.

01:12:17.292 --> 01:12:18.292
Bingo!

01:12:19.917 --> 01:12:21.407
Where's Finlay?

01:12:24.417 --> 01:12:25.532
Is he in here?

01:12:30.875 --> 01:12:32.155
- Would you come with me?
- What?

01:12:32.292 --> 01:12:34.018
- Would you come with me right now?
- What are you talking about?

01:12:34.042 --> 01:12:35.782
I can't come with you!

01:12:35.958 --> 01:12:38.165
- Come with me.
- Rachel, what are you doing?

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.619
He stabbed her right here.

01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:03.373
So there'd be blood everywhere.

01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:06.869
She was right here.

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:10.206
Well, she's not here now.

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:13.831
Come on, let's go.

01:13:16.708 --> 01:13:17.993
She was here.

01:13:22.417 --> 01:13:24.624
We need to do something.
Get more police here.

01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:26.328
I'm not taking
anyone else out there.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.697
- Someone must have moved the body.
- Rachel.

01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:30.875
Rachel.

01:13:31.042 --> 01:13:33.158
I want you to listen to me.

01:13:33.792 --> 01:13:35.657
Angus McCulloch is dead.

01:13:37.208 --> 01:13:39.073
And I'll bet your friend
is at home right now

01:13:39.792 --> 01:13:42.249
reading the newspaper
and eating scones.

01:14:01.167 --> 01:14:04.079
Hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message after the beep.

01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:08.039
She's not there.

01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:11.449
Yes, but that doesn't mean
she came up here.

01:14:11.917 --> 01:14:14.283
Wherever she is,
I'm sure she's absolutely fine.

01:14:18.417 --> 01:14:21.955
I want you to spend tonight
with Mary and me.

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.536
I don't think
you should be alone.

01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:28.831
What do you think,
I'm making this up?

01:14:30.542 --> 01:14:32.407
Nobody's out to get you.

01:14:34.458 --> 01:14:36.540
Listen, if this was
one of your books,

01:14:36.792 --> 01:14:38.453
which would you believe?

01:14:38.875 --> 01:14:41.412
That the heroine fell
in love with a ghost

01:14:41.583 --> 01:14:43.790
who then murdered
her best friend...

01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:46.285
Or...

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.115
That she imagined it

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:52.536
and she needs some help?

01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:58.365
I'm not crazy.

01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:02.952
Well,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.456
the offer's there.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.615
I'm at the other end of the phone.

01:15:12.667 --> 01:15:15.409
Hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message after the beep.

01:15:16.583 --> 01:15:19.541
Hi, it's me.
I don't know where you are.

01:15:20.417 --> 01:15:22.999
I don't know if you came out here.

01:15:23.625 --> 01:15:27.914
I don't know what's going on but if
you could call me when you get this.

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:30.285
Okay?

01:15:34.167 --> 01:15:36.658
Hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message after...

01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:40.244
Hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message...

01:15:40.917 --> 01:15:42.498
Leave a message after the beep.

01:15:42.667 --> 01:15:43.998
Leave a message...

01:15:53.042 --> 01:15:54.703
Doctor Freedman, table for four.

01:15:56.292 --> 01:15:58.283
- This way, sir.
- Hello?

01:15:58.583 --> 01:16:00.289
Robert, it's me.

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:02.898
Rachel, listen, I'm just in
a restaurant. Can I call you back?

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:05.449
No, no, no. Listen...

01:16:06.542 --> 01:16:10.160
I don't know how to explain this
but I think that Sharon

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:12.915
came out here and that

01:16:13.167 --> 01:16:14.577
she may have been hurt.

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:16.957
What?
What are you talking about?

01:16:17.125 --> 01:16:19.411
I need you to do me
a favour, okay?

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:20.583
Rachel, slow down.

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:21.956
What's happening?

01:16:22.917 --> 01:16:26.455
I don't know what's happening.
That's just it. Can you...

01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:29.287
Can you please
just go to Sharon's?

01:16:30.167 --> 01:16:32.579
She's not answering
her phone or her cell.

01:16:33.417 --> 01:16:34.417
What for?

01:16:34.583 --> 01:16:38.576
I just need you to go there,
okay, and then call me, okay?

01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:40.240
Well, why shouldn't she be there?

01:16:40.417 --> 01:16:44.160
Look... I just need you
to go there and then call me.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:46.726
Rachel, can't this wait? I've
got friends here, we're about to...

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:51.073
No. Please, can you just
do this for me? Okay?

01:16:51.458 --> 01:16:54.370
Okay. I'll go there
and I'll call you.

01:16:54.625 --> 01:16:56.616
Okay, I'm going to be waiting.

01:16:57.083 --> 01:16:58.289
Okay.

01:17:04.083 --> 01:17:06.449
Alright, sorry about that.
Thanks very much.

01:17:07.542 --> 01:17:09.498
Thank you. Okay?

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.910
I need to talk to you.

01:18:00.583 --> 01:18:01.743
Comeiin.

01:18:04.667 --> 01:18:05.747
The scots

01:18:05.917 --> 01:18:08.659
call it da-shealladh.
Second sight.

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:10.740
It's been my ruin.

01:18:12.917 --> 01:18:15.078
You think the living
are full of regrets?

01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:19.037
You ought to hear
the dead endlessly lamenting.

01:18:20.125 --> 01:18:21.865
"Never made up with my childrenâ...

01:18:22.792 --> 01:18:24.328
"Ignored my parents"...

01:18:25.917 --> 01:18:27.748
"Never told anyone I love them"...

01:18:28.667 --> 01:18:30.953
This isn't some kind
of game, is it?

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.832
I mean, you wouldn't
just make this up?

01:18:36.333 --> 01:18:37.994
My son drowned.

01:18:39.792 --> 01:18:41.748
I just want to know that you...

01:18:43.917 --> 01:18:46.033
That this isn't something
you would take lightly.

01:18:46.208 --> 01:18:48.244
He follows you everywhere.

01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:50.994
He's trying to warn you.

01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:53.164
About what?

01:18:53.875 --> 01:18:54.955
What?

01:18:55.708 --> 01:18:56.743
Angus?

01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:58.625
What are you saying?

01:18:58.792 --> 01:19:01.454
- Are you saying he's not dead?
- Oh, he's dead.

01:19:02.083 --> 01:19:04.495
His ghost's out there
wandering the island.

01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:08.780
Suicides are forever trapped
between our world and the next.

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:12.491
When I cross I don't want
anything on my conscience.

01:19:13.375 --> 01:19:15.115
Don't go back to the island.

01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:17.035
Leave ingonish cove tonight.

01:19:17.208 --> 01:19:20.450
Your life's in danger. That's what
Thomas has come back to tell you.

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:25.289
I have to go back
to get Thomas's things.

01:19:25.958 --> 01:19:27.118
Well, do it quickly.

01:19:37.958 --> 01:19:40.415
- Would you like some of mine?
- Yeah. One second.

01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:43.990
Hello?

01:19:44.167 --> 01:19:45.452
Have you gone to Sharon's?

01:19:45.625 --> 01:19:46.990
I called her,
she's not answering.

01:19:47.167 --> 01:19:48.532
What's this all about?

01:19:52.958 --> 01:19:54.823
- Would you excuse me a second?
- Yeah, sure.

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:00.081
Are you awake?

01:20:00.875 --> 01:20:02.957
Robert. What a surprise.

01:20:03.625 --> 01:20:05.518
I'm sorry to call you so late,
do you have a second?

01:20:05.542 --> 01:20:06.542
Yes.

01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:09.449
I'm just doing
a little late night editing.

01:20:09.625 --> 01:20:10.625
What's going on?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.332
Something strange
is going on with Rachel.

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:14.952
She's called me twice.

01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:17.662
She's going on about Sharon
being hurt somehow...

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.582
She's not making sense.
I knew she shouldn't

01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:22.365
have gone out there by herself.

01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:25.489
You don't think she's going
to do anything stupid, do you?

01:20:25.583 --> 01:20:27.665
The way she sounded,
nothing would surprise me.

01:20:28.125 --> 01:20:29.285
Christ.

01:20:31.208 --> 01:20:32.914
I was worried about this.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.956
Well, listen,
I'm going to call her now.

01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:38.824
I think you should.
And get Sharon to, also.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.706
Yes, of course. Of course.

01:20:42.333 --> 01:20:43.664
Well... thanks for calling.

01:20:43.833 --> 01:20:46.950
Okay, tell me how it goes.
I hope everything's okay.

01:20:47.583 --> 01:20:49.039
Yes, I will,

01:21:52.833 --> 01:21:54.243
Back from the dead?

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.581
You look good for a corpse.

01:22:15.667 --> 01:22:16.747
Where's the rest of it?

01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:19.160
You get it when we get it.

01:22:19.333 --> 01:22:20.743
Well, my price just doubled.

01:22:23.333 --> 01:22:26.780
Four million... slightly more
than you told me.

01:22:30.167 --> 01:22:32.533
Do you know what the funny thing
about you and Brian is?

01:22:33.583 --> 01:22:35.244
You always talk about him.

01:22:37.167 --> 01:22:40.000
All the ways
the two of you are going

01:22:40.458 --> 01:22:41.948
to enjoy the money.

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:44.823
But Brian,

01:22:45.333 --> 01:22:48.245
he never talks about the money,
and he never talks about you.

01:22:48.875 --> 01:22:50.581
He always talks about her.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.822
Her books, her success,
her imagination.

01:22:55.833 --> 01:22:58.700
It's envy of her, isn't it?

01:22:59.792 --> 01:23:01.623
That brought you two together.

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:10.282
You both just want to be her.

01:23:11.667 --> 01:23:13.908
The ghost has a heart, huh?

01:23:15.833 --> 01:23:17.289
Is that why
you were on the balcony?

01:23:17.458 --> 01:23:19.323
You were meant to be downstairs.

01:23:19.625 --> 01:23:20.740
Tonight?

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.240
I wasn't on the balcony.

01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:25.949
I was downstairs the whole time.

01:23:27.125 --> 01:23:28.581
And besides,

01:23:29.292 --> 01:23:31.624
you're the ones
who've been improvising.

01:23:32.292 --> 01:23:34.999
What's with all the messages
from her dead kid?

01:23:35.167 --> 01:23:36.907
We never did that.

01:23:37.792 --> 01:23:39.748
Good idea, though.
But we never did it.

01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:45.661
How do you get
your hands on the money?

01:23:46.417 --> 01:23:48.408
I thought you were
the guy who never asked?

01:23:49.083 --> 01:23:50.414
"I do the job.

01:23:50.708 --> 01:23:52.790
They pay me. I go home."

01:23:53.833 --> 01:23:56.905
You did the job, so go home.

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.707
You didn't fall for her,
did you, Patrick?

01:24:02.583 --> 01:24:04.949
While you were pretending
to fall for her?

01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:10.250
Your whole life
may have just collapsed.

01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:18.160
Do you remember...

01:24:20.458 --> 01:24:21.743
What I was doing...

01:24:23.375 --> 01:24:24.865
When we first met?

01:24:28.875 --> 01:24:29.955
Yeah.

01:24:30.667 --> 01:24:32.248
I thought you might.

01:24:35.375 --> 01:24:37.206
I want the rest of the money.

01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:41.703
I won't tell you again.

01:24:52.458 --> 01:24:53.573
Sharon?

01:24:56.875 --> 01:24:59.662
It was a pleasure killing you.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:13.490
All aboard!

01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:15.830
Sir!

01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:19.990
All aboard!

01:30:01.667 --> 01:30:02.907
I jove these.

01:30:08.208 --> 01:30:10.540
Do you know the old
Celtic legend about them?

01:30:13.208 --> 01:30:17.156
First, we have
to bury it together.

01:30:19.667 --> 01:30:20.998
Together.

01:30:39.917 --> 01:30:43.785
And then if one of us
ever returns and digs it up,

01:30:45.042 --> 01:30:48.034
- then...
- Then we were meant for each other?

01:30:50.083 --> 01:30:52.540
Well, actually, I don't know
because I just made it up.

01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:53.456
Rachel?

01:33:10.708 --> 01:33:12.494
Just room for one more inside.

01:33:12.667 --> 01:33:15.374
So there was nothing at all
out there on the island?

01:33:16.167 --> 01:33:18.374
No. Poor girl must be crazy.

01:33:19.042 --> 01:33:20.907
She's got guests in the attic.

01:33:22.417 --> 01:33:23.702
Hey, I love this bit.

01:33:23.875 --> 01:33:24.990
It's great.

01:33:25.875 --> 01:33:28.161
This is where Hugo
the dummy comes alive.

01:33:33.042 --> 01:33:34.498
It's nearly midnight.

01:33:42.417 --> 01:33:44.624
- I need your help out on the island.
- For god's sake.

01:33:44.792 --> 01:33:46.712
Rachel's in danger.
It might be too late already.

01:33:46.833 --> 01:33:49.620
It's very late tonight.
You come back in the morning.

01:33:49.792 --> 01:33:51.657
Finlay, please.
I need your help.

01:33:51.833 --> 01:33:52.913
Finlay...

01:33:53.917 --> 01:33:57.455
The last time she tried to warn us
about something we all ignored her.

01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:00.957
And we had 3 funerals
the next Sunday.

01:34:31.083 --> 01:34:33.199
- Brian, wait.
- Look, relax.

01:34:34.167 --> 01:34:35.873
Everything's gone perfectly.

01:34:38.083 --> 01:34:39.744
Everyone thinks she's crazy.

01:34:40.292 --> 01:34:43.079
The whole village...
Even her own shrink.

01:34:45.833 --> 01:34:48.825
She's in love with a ghost.
She sees murders that don't happen.

01:34:52.167 --> 01:34:53.247
No one...

01:34:54.208 --> 01:34:56.745
No one's going to blink
an eye when she kills herself.

01:35:01.167 --> 01:35:02.452
Then her grieving husband

01:35:03.083 --> 01:35:04.994
inherits four million pounds.

01:35:08.875 --> 01:35:10.411
And you thought

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.082
I had no imagination...

01:35:26.583 --> 01:35:28.414
Just in case she loses courage.

01:35:29.042 --> 01:35:31.454
Just in case she wants
to save herself at the last moment.

01:35:35.167 --> 01:35:36.748
She throws the key out of reach.

01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:48.332
- Throws the anchor overboard.
- Wait!

01:35:49.708 --> 01:35:50.708
What?

01:35:50.917 --> 01:35:52.657
There's someone out there.

01:36:01.583 --> 01:36:04.120
- You see Patrick get on the train?
- No.

01:36:05.833 --> 01:36:07.619
It's got to be him.

01:36:10.333 --> 01:36:12.119
What's he doing?

01:36:12.375 --> 01:36:13.455
I don't know.

01:36:15.417 --> 01:36:17.248
We've gone too far to stop now.

01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:33.411
Brian. She's awake.

01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:07.535
Don't look.

01:37:08.708 --> 01:37:10.164
Don't look.

01:37:13.167 --> 01:37:14.407
It's over.

01:37:14.708 --> 01:37:16.369
We've got to see about Patrick.

01:38:04.167 --> 01:38:07.409
Don't forget, look behind you.

01:38:39.667 --> 01:38:41.032
He's not here.

01:38:41.208 --> 01:38:43.119
This place gives me the creeps.

01:38:44.208 --> 01:38:47.280
What if Patrick was telling the
truth and he wasn't on the balcony?

01:38:49.417 --> 01:38:52.784
Remember those sailors who said they
saw Angus's ghost on the island?

01:38:53.208 --> 01:38:54.288
Yeah.

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:57.697
Drunk scots sailors.
Very reliable.

01:38:59.458 --> 01:39:01.824
He's not here. Let's go.

01:39:05.917 --> 01:39:07.657
Start tying yourself up!

01:39:34.125 --> 01:39:36.116
This isn't one
of your stories, Rachel.

01:39:41.458 --> 01:39:43.289
There's not going
to be a happy ending.

01:40:05.875 --> 01:40:06.875
Patrick.

01:40:08.958 --> 01:40:09.958
No.

01:40:11.833 --> 01:40:13.039
Not Patrick.

01:41:27.583 --> 01:41:28.583
No!

01:43:06.417 --> 01:43:08.203
It's better this way, you know.

01:43:10.333 --> 01:43:11.539
Thank you.

01:43:13.167 --> 01:43:15.158
We'll keep people off the island.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.161
Maybe then Angus
can rest in peace.

01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:20.865
You ready?

01:43:35.250 --> 01:43:36.990
Do you know what
Thomas would have wanted?

01:43:38.708 --> 01:43:40.369
Let go of his death.

01:43:41.125 --> 01:43:42.535
Remember his life.
