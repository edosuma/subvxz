00:06.440 --> 00:07.308
Hi.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.242
Hey.

00:08.276 --> 00:09.843
Fred's taking Andy
to the ballgame;

00:09.877 --> 00:12.213
I wanted you to see how cute
he looked before they left.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.348
Aw, you look real cute, Fred.

00:14.382 --> 00:17.551
Oh-ho-ho, look at
Andy's little outfit.

00:17.585 --> 00:18.886
Oh, so sweet!

00:18.919 --> 00:19.787
Sweet?

00:19.820 --> 00:20.821
Hear that, Jackie?

00:20.854 --> 00:23.591
You're dressing our
boy to look sweet.

00:23.624 --> 00:24.858
Oh, did I say sweet?

00:24.892 --> 00:25.759
I meant dainty.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.897
You know, if we want him
to grow up to be a man,

00:29.930 --> 00:31.199
we should dress him like a man.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.433
Why?

00:32.466 --> 00:36.470
I think the burping and
drooling should cover that.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.372
I'm the one who dresses
him every morning.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.074
I'm going to choose
what he wears.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.042
I am this kid's father,
and I should have as much

00:42.076 --> 00:43.911
say in it as his mother does.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.314
Well, Fred, if you
ever pass a kidney stone,

00:46.347 --> 00:49.517
we'll let you dress that up.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.018
Andy, we got to go.

00:51.051 --> 00:56.224
I can feel these uterine
walls closing in on us.

00:56.257 --> 00:59.026
So, tomorrow,
we get the results

00:59.059 --> 01:01.262
of the second amnio test.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.264
Thinking good thoughts.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.399
Yeah, I had one of them once.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.734
You and Dan doing OK?

01:06.767 --> 01:08.702
No, he's been a total jerk.

01:08.736 --> 01:09.903
Really?

01:09.937 --> 01:12.273
Yeah, all he thinks
about is himself, you know.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.775
He's worried that a sick baby
might be an inconvenience

01:14.808 --> 01:16.144
to him, so he's
trying to hint around

01:16.177 --> 01:17.645
that I should have an abortion.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.314
Oh, I'm sure he knows
it's your decision.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.416
I mean, he must respect
your right to choose.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.585
Yeah, long as I I
choose to agree with him.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.553
Hey.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.555
We're out of shampoo.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.457
Well, since when did you
become too good for Tide?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.429
Forget I asked.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.298
When are you gonna
go paint that crib?

01:37.331 --> 01:39.133
I want to get started
on that nursery.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.935
Well, I thought we'd
wait until, you know--

01:41.969 --> 01:42.836
Until what, Dan?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.605
Just say what you mean.
- Fine.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.873
You want me to paint the crib?

01:45.906 --> 01:46.940
I'll paint the crib.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.075
What the hell is your--

01:48.108 --> 01:49.177
Hey, DJ!

01:49.210 --> 01:53.314
What do you say, Mr.
brand-new turtleneck?

01:53.347 --> 01:54.448
What are you
guys yelling about?

01:54.482 --> 01:55.716
We're not yelling.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.751
Yes, we're just practicing
for when we're old

01:57.785 --> 02:00.488
and we can't hear.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.756
DJ, why don't you
get out of here?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.625
- I haven't had any breakfast.
- OK, here.

02:04.658 --> 02:05.793
Take this.
Go.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.900
- He doesn't know?
- No, he's too young.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.636
And he's not gonna find
out, right, Roseanne?

02:15.669 --> 02:16.537
Well, I don't know, Dan.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.905
I think we should tell him.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.507
And then we should go out and
tell the whole neighborhood.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.376
How else are they all going
to vote on what I could do?

02:22.410 --> 02:23.777
I mean it, Roseanne.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.813
Till we decide on this, I don't
think we should worry the boy.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.817
You're right, you know.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.018
He was pushing you.

02:31.051 --> 02:32.486
I thought Dan was
better than that.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.387
Why?

02:33.421 --> 02:34.522
He's a man.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.156
You know, this is the
only area in the world

02:36.190 --> 02:38.326
that they can't control, and it
drives them crazy, because it

02:38.359 --> 02:40.761
doesn't come with a remote.

02:40.794 --> 02:41.862
You know we're out of shampoo?

02:47.435 --> 02:51.239
Yeah, well, I'll wear a hat.

explained camping to you.

different this time.

What are you fighting about?

04:59.467 --> 05:02.235
Well, I guess I should
probably tell you.

It's about your Christmas gift.

talk with you alone.

didn't make it all

I can't believe you're
treating Roseanne this way.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.403
Jackie.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.303
It's none of your business.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.739
It is my business.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.906
She's my sister.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.508
And you are trying to
push her to do something

06:14.542 --> 06:15.676
that she might not want to do.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.177
I'm not pushing her;
this is her decision.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.979
No, no.
You don't really mean that.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.180
Yes, I do.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.249
I don't agree with
it, but I accept it.

06:22.282 --> 06:23.617
I'm not trying to
tell her what to do.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.486
Well, no, not straight
out, you're not.

06:25.519 --> 06:28.622
You just hint, and
imply, and, uh--

06:28.656 --> 06:30.824
you know, hint.

06:30.858 --> 06:31.725
No, I don't.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.126
Really?

06:33.160 --> 06:35.362
Shouldn't we wait to paint
the crib, Roseanne, until--

06:35.395 --> 06:38.432
you know?

06:38.466 --> 06:40.701
Why don't you just tie
her to the examining table

06:40.734 --> 06:42.202
and tell the doctor
what you want done.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.036
Stop it.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.308
Who you think you are?

06:48.341 --> 06:51.979
I said that because I thought
if we got the news tomorrow,

06:52.012 --> 06:53.847
and it was bad, and
Roseanne-- not me,

06:53.881 --> 06:55.716
but Roseanne decided
to have an abortion,

06:55.749 --> 06:57.184
it might be hard
for her to come home

06:57.217 --> 06:58.652
to a freshly painted baby bed.

07:01.622 --> 07:02.523
Oh.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.991
I'm not trying
to influence her,

07:04.024 --> 07:05.125
I'm trying to help
her through this.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.898
Every time I open my
mouth, she shuts me out.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.033
OK, I'm sorry.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.503
You know, you're not going
to tell me that Roseanne is

07:15.536 --> 07:16.804
the only person you're
thinking of here,

07:16.837 --> 07:18.305
because you know what
you want her he do.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.640
Yeah.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.109
If it was up to me, and there
was something really wrong

07:22.142 --> 07:24.311
with the baby, I'd want
her to have an abortion.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.412
Have you thought
about how hard

07:25.445 --> 07:27.615
that might be for Roseanne?

07:27.648 --> 07:30.083
Do you realize how
selfish that is?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.753
That what you think?

07:32.786 --> 07:33.987
Why don't you just
leave me alone, Jack.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.359
I'm not trying to be selfish.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.598
And what if the
baby's born wrong?

07:44.632 --> 07:47.100
What if it's born without
a brain or something?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.941
What would that do
to the family, huh?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.909
What would that do to Roseanne?

07:55.943 --> 07:58.478
Oh, Dan.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.013
I'm afraid it's going
to wreck our marriage.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.615
I mean, look how well
we've handled this stress.

08:04.117 --> 08:04.985
I'm sorry.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.353
I-- I had no idea.

08:06.386 --> 08:07.387
That's all right.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.523
Just-- I'd like to
be alone right now.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.967
Jackie, that's the
opposite of alone.

08:27.541 --> 08:28.576
I don't like that either.

08:31.879 --> 08:32.680
No.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.163
I'll get this back to you.

playing for money.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.347
So how you doing?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.750
I called you because I figured
you probably had your fill

09:09.783 --> 09:12.485
of fighting with Roseanne.
- Well, you're late, Fred.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.822
You should have called in 1975.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.423
I heard she pretty
much shut you out.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.892
Oh, she still talks to me.

09:18.926 --> 09:23.964
Every now and again, she'll
point at me and go, you.

09:23.997 --> 09:24.865
I'm really sorry, man.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.967
Yeah, well, thanks.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.401
Listen, I know it's
none of my business,

09:28.435 --> 09:30.370
but would you mind
if I said something

09:30.403 --> 09:31.338
to you about all this?

09:31.371 --> 09:33.106
Yeah, sure.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.276
As long as you keep it short
and you don't try to hug me.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.177
Oh.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.679
Well, now there's no point.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.050
Look, I-- I just
don't think you'd

09:43.083 --> 09:46.286
be a terrible person if you
demanded some control over what

09:46.319 --> 09:48.689
Roseanne's going to do.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.991
Roseanne and demand.

Having a kid, it's--
it's half yours.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.334
This is a 50-50 proposition.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.904
Yeah, when it
finally comes out.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.006
You gotta admit, Fred,
this is different.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.274
Is it?

10:07.307 --> 10:08.742
I mean, Roseanne and I
always make the big decisions

10:08.776 --> 10:11.044
about the kids together.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.480
Sometimes she gets her way,
sometimes I get my way.

10:13.513 --> 10:14.982
Oh, OK.
Forget it.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.216
No, I mean it,
it's like the time I

10:16.249 --> 10:18.018
kicked David out of the house.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.420
She didn't like it,
but I got my way.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.622
Yeah, but then you let David
move right back in again,

10:22.656 --> 10:23.523
didn't you?

10:23.556 --> 10:24.725
Then she got her way.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.427
50-50.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.797
Hey, Dan, I'm not saying
it's your fault. You know,

10:29.830 --> 10:31.364
Jackie's the same way.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.566
They have the kids, so they
figure that they own them.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.402
Well, maybe that's the way
it is at your house, Fred.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.404
But me and Roseanne are OK.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.306
I'm not saying Jackie
doesn't try to push me around,

10:39.339 --> 10:41.675
but at least I still
put up a fight.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.877
Hey, don't tell
me I don't fight.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.246

not shadow-boxing like you.

I'm hitting the heavy bag.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.719
And you're way
behind on points.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.654

11:14.374 --> 11:15.809
I did kind of cheat
you on breakfast,

11:15.843 --> 11:18.078
so, how about I'll
make you a great snack?

11:18.111 --> 11:20.013
OK.

11:20.047 --> 11:20.914
Got your message.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.382
What's up?

11:22.415 --> 11:24.718
DJ, get out of here.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.587
- Where's my snack?
- Here you go.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.421
Go.

11:33.861 --> 11:34.728
Are you all right?

11:34.762 --> 11:35.929
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.497
I was just wondering if
you could get Leon to take

11:37.530 --> 11:38.732
your shift tomorrow morning.

11:38.766 --> 11:39.632
Probably.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.001
Why?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.569
Because I want you to go to
the doctor's with me and Dan.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.905
No, I-- I really think
it's something that you

11:44.938 --> 11:46.239
two ought to do alone together.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.641
Come on, Jackie, I might
have a really hard decision

11:48.675 --> 11:50.243
to make tomorrow, and
I want some support

11:50.277 --> 11:52.312
from somebody that gets it
- Dan will support you!

11:52.345 --> 11:54.081
That's what he's there for!

11:54.114 --> 11:57.050
No, he's there to
push his opinion on me.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.486
And I do not need to get bad
news and look over to that face

11:59.519 --> 12:00.520
and know what he's thinking.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.189
He's not going to
push his ideas on you.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.323
Have you-- have
you really sat down

12:03.356 --> 12:04.925
and talked to Dan about this?

12:04.958 --> 12:07.260
Why would I do that?

12:07.294 --> 12:08.695
What, are you a man now?

12:08.728 --> 12:09.963
Did you grow a kickstand?

12:13.801 --> 12:16.003
I talked to Dan,

12:16.036 --> 12:17.404
You talked him Dan about this?

12:17.437 --> 12:20.073
Yes, yes, and I thought that
he made some very good points.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.810
He's worried about what a
sick baby might do to you.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.912
Roseanne, he's thinking
about the whole family.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.014
Oh, so you're on his side now?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.982
No, it's still your decision.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.450
He just wants to be heard.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.351
I heard him.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.986
He loves you, Roseanne.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.988
So you think I should
do what he says, right?

12:35.022 --> 12:36.890
No one is trying
to control you.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.158
Yes, they are, Jackie.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.592
You just don't get it.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.029
This is not Dan's decision,
and it is not yours.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.798
I have to make it, and
I have to live with it.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.599
You're not listening to me.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.634
Get out.

12:47.667 --> 12:48.535
Roseanne!

12:48.568 --> 12:49.669
No, I'm serious.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.071
Get the hell out of
here and leave me alone.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.852
You OK?

13:04.885 --> 13:06.253
No, I lost my tiara.

13:11.024 --> 13:14.394
What were you and Aunt
Jackie fighting about?

13:14.427 --> 13:16.796
Which one of us
is the prettiest.

13:16.830 --> 13:17.764
Whose side are you on?

13:21.368 --> 13:24.037
Everything's fine, DJ.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.539
Are you sick?

13:26.573 --> 13:28.041
What are you
asking me that for?

13:28.075 --> 13:30.710
Because everybody's
fighting and whispering.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.379
Like they were at
Ralph's house last year

13:32.412 --> 13:35.048
when his mom was sick.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.683
No, I'm not sick.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.551
Then what's going on here?

13:38.585 --> 13:40.921
I mean, you can't still be
arguing about my Christmas

13:40.954 --> 13:44.457
present, like Dad said.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.493
Well, I don't agree
with your father, DJ.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.329
I don't think it's right to buy
everyone a present except you.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.834
Well, when Ralph's
mom needed an operation,

13:54.868 --> 13:56.369
they lied to him, too.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.204
Come here.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.485
OK.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.853
I'm going to tell you
the truth, because you're

14:13.887 --> 14:16.256
not a little kid anymore.

14:16.289 --> 14:20.127
I'm OK, but, um--

14:20.160 --> 14:22.295
there's a chance that--

14:22.329 --> 14:24.331
something's wrong with the baby.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.465
Oh.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.366
Yeah.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.869
So, I have to, uh--

14:29.903 --> 14:34.274
make a decision whether
to have it or not.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.977
You mean you might
have an abortion?

14:37.010 --> 14:38.411
Uh, yeah.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.646
Yeah, that, maybe.

14:39.679 --> 14:40.847
I don't know.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.517
It's just a very, very
complicated decision, DJ.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.818
Why?

14:45.852 --> 14:50.357
Because I have wanted to
have a baby for a long time.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.525
Well, if you decide
not to have the baby,

14:52.559 --> 14:54.194
when you come back
from the hospital,

14:54.227 --> 14:55.495
we can take care of you.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.964
Hey.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.765
I know you're going
to be a man someday,

14:58.798 --> 15:00.467
but, see, you cannot do this.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.734
Do what?

15:01.768 --> 15:04.137
No man has any right to
tell any woman what she should

15:04.171 --> 15:07.240
do in a situation like this.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.608
I'm not!

15:08.641 --> 15:11.778
I'm just saying that if you do
have the baby and it's sick,

15:11.811 --> 15:15.448
we can take care
of the baby, too.

15:15.482 --> 15:18.685
So, you mean,
you're saying, like--

15:18.718 --> 15:21.621
what, that you would
support any decision I make?

15:21.654 --> 15:22.455
Yeah.

15:25.192 --> 15:26.193
Oh, well.

15:26.226 --> 15:29.929
Thanks.
Thanks a lot, DJ.

15:29.963 --> 15:35.335
It really makes me feel better
that you can handle the truth.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.436
Good.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.804
So am I getting a dirt
bike for Christm--

15:37.837 --> 15:39.272
No.

15:39.306 --> 15:47.080
[music playing]

15:47.114 --> 15:47.981
Huh.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.916
Look at this.

15:49.949 --> 15:50.750
He's got three kids.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.488
Man, if that's what he
thinks kids look like,

15:55.522 --> 15:57.124
how's he gonna know if
something's wrong with ours?

16:03.730 --> 16:06.166
Listen, honey.

16:06.199 --> 16:09.936
No matter what this
doctor says, I'm

16:09.969 --> 16:11.238
gonna want to talk about this.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.309
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.477
Oh, no, that's OK.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.047
We still had four bottles
of beer on the wall.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.882
Well, then take one
down, and pass it ar--

16:26.553 --> 16:27.487
Uh.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.590
Uh, the results of
the second amnio

16:30.623 --> 16:34.194
indicate that apparently, his
first test was contaminated.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.029
Second sample shows
that everything

16:36.063 --> 16:37.064
is developing normally.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.331
Oh.
Really?

16:38.365 --> 16:39.366
Mhm.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.667
You mean the kid's OK?

16:40.700 --> 16:41.634
That's right.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.569
Mm.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.504
Thank god.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.773
Hallelujah.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.576
I'm sure you two would
like to have some time alone.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.479
Congratulations. take
all the time you want.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.147
Oh, by the way, it's a girl.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.421
Oh, my god, it's
a little girl.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.356
Oh, boy, another daughter.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.325
She'll be able to
wear hand-me-downs

17:05.358 --> 17:06.326
from Jackie's boy.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.105
Hey, I'm really sorry, Dan.

17:18.138 --> 17:21.941
I-- I know I was, like, pushing
you away all week, and--

17:21.974 --> 17:23.410
I wasn't a very good wife.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.078
Oh, man, I know, that's OK.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.879
You've been through a lot.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.348
At least we're
partners again, right?

17:28.381 --> 17:29.382
50-50?

17:29.416 --> 17:31.084
God, I just couldn't
stand not knowing.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.885
I was so scared.
- Hey.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.555
I haven't been
that great, either.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.225
Oh, come on, Dan, now
this is my apology, OK?

17:38.258 --> 17:39.126
Let me be the ass.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.493
You always get to be the ass.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.631
OK.

17:44.664 --> 17:48.201
As of tonight, you are the
biggest ass in the world.

17:48.235 --> 17:51.404
God, could this day
possibly get any better?

17:51.438 --> 17:59.179
[music playing]

17:59.212 --> 18:01.581
We are going to
celebrate so huge tonight.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.082
Anything you want for dinner.

18:03.116 --> 18:06.953
Oh, great, let's finish
off DJ's Halloween candy.

18:06.986 --> 18:10.990
Well, I already had that
celebration without you.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.292
All right, then
we'll just have

18:12.325 --> 18:14.327
a romantic dinner and finish
off with an R-rated movie.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.228
Oh, yeah?

18:15.262 --> 18:16.529
I've got a better idea.

18:16.563 --> 18:20.300
We skip dinner, and we'll
make our own R-rated movie.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.502
OK, but I only appear naked
if it's tasteful and organic

18:22.535 --> 18:23.336
to the plot.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.941
Hey.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.743
Something's different.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.146
What?

18:33.180 --> 18:35.114
Not only did
God help our baby,

18:35.148 --> 18:38.318
but he cleaned our kitchen.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.786
What are you doing
with all of this?

18:39.819 --> 18:41.854
They were all over upstairs.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.324
I mean, under my bed,
and Becky's room.

18:44.357 --> 18:48.428
She even had a piece of
birthday cake in the bathroom.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.396
I was saving that.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.535
Well, DJ, your mother
and I are very proud of you

18:55.568 --> 18:59.406
for covering up whatever you've
done in such a clever way.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.773
I just thought I'd help out.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.743
I mean, I felt really
bad about the baby.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.445
That's so sweet, DJ.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.646
But you know what,
there's nothing

19:06.679 --> 19:08.181
to worry about, because
we just saw the doctor

19:08.215 --> 19:10.417
and he said the baby's fine.
- It is?

19:10.450 --> 19:11.551
Yeah.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.386
But, uh, I think it'd be
a lot better if you went

19:13.420 --> 19:14.254
and cleaned up the backyard.

19:17.557 --> 19:18.791
DJ, you don't
have to do any more.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.626
Thanks!

19:23.396 --> 19:26.733
Why did you tell DJ
the baby might be sick?

19:26.766 --> 19:28.067
What?

19:28.100 --> 19:30.002
I thought we talked and we
agreed that we weren't going

19:30.036 --> 19:31.671
to say anything to the kids.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.273
Well, we didn't.
I did.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.374
Well, you should
have asked me.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.008
Why?

19:36.042 --> 19:38.445
Because we agreed!

19:38.478 --> 19:40.012
Well, I changed our minds.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.449
Really, 50/50, Roseanne?

19:42.482 --> 19:44.016
- What's your problem?
- Ah, fine.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.753
Ah-- nothing.
I don't have a problem.

19:46.786 --> 19:47.954
Well, great.

19:47.987 --> 19:52.124
So, well, what do you
want to do to celebrate?

19:52.158 --> 19:53.626
Well, you wanted me
to paint that baby bed.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.461
I might as well get on it.

19:58.898 --> 20:04.271
[music playing]

20:04.304 --> 20:09.141
[music playing]

20:09.175 --> 20:10.477
Say, dear.

20:10.510 --> 20:14.080
Isn't Roseanne and Dan's
little girls 16 today?

20:14.113 --> 20:14.914
I know.

20:17.817 --> 20:21.254
I-- I sent her a
birthday gift, and I also

20:21.288 --> 20:24.724
got a little something
for her two kids.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.493
You know, that reminds
me, DJ called today,

20:26.526 --> 20:28.295
and he finally got
that big promotion.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.862
Oh, that's great.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.432
He has wanted to get on
that trapeze for years.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.704
Ooh!
Well, where's our little Andy?

20:37.737 --> 20:40.473
That kid is going to
miss his football game.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.708
Well, don't worry, dear.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.009
I don't think they're
going to start without him.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.345
After all, he is the
captain of the squad.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.913
Do you remember how
you used to complain

20:46.946 --> 20:50.450
about the way I dressed him?
- Andy!

20:50.483 --> 20:52.685
Hurry up there, buddy boy!

20:52.719 --> 20:54.120
Will you guys stop yelling?

20:54.153 --> 20:55.054
I'm ready.

20:59.058 --> 21:02.795
Now, son, before you go out
there on that field today,

21:02.829 --> 21:04.864
your momma and I-- we just
want to tell you one thing.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.733
We are so proud of you.

21:06.766 --> 21:11.304
You've turned into one
fine strapping young man.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.806
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.408
Where are my pom poms?

21:15.442 --> 21:16.876
Right where you left
them, up by your purse.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.315
Yep.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.150
