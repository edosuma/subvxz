00:02.300 --> 00:03.950
Tiara...

00:04.000 --> 00:05.990
I thought it was you.

00:06.240 --> 00:10.240
Do you want a lift? It's
all right, I know your mum.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.270
- Oh, morning Nat.
- Hello, Martin, what's this?

00:23.320 --> 00:27.320
- Fudge Friday. What about having a bit of fun?
- No, I'm supposed to

00:27.720 --> 00:30.630
- have a free from Friday.
- Free from what? Being efficient?

00:30.680 --> 00:33.270
Oh, now come on, Nitin. Don't be mean!

00:33.320 --> 00:37.320
You can find that Nat's got a
firm grasp now on our quite complex

00:38.160 --> 00:39.590
telecommunications system.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.730
Thanks, Martin.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.190
- Fuck! Umm...
- Press three.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.030
Press three.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.150
Press three. Just...

00:47.200 --> 00:49.990
I meant free from everything
that's bad for you, actually.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.110
Ah, well, now, funny you should say that

00:52.160 --> 00:56.150
because this fudge is dairy,
gluten, and sugar-free.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.510
- I got the recipe from... - Ingrid.
- Yes, yes. So easy to follow.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.910
Just pop the fudge in the fridge
overnight and hey, presto.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.960
Woke up this morning with fudgy fingers.

01:11.120 --> 01:14.270
What biscuit barrel? We
haven't got a biscuit barrel.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.390
That's an urn. That is my nan's ashes!

01:17.440 --> 01:20.390
Yes, yes! You can have it!
Just put the ashes in the bin!

01:20.440 --> 01:23.670
Now, who are you? You're just
over the line, just in time.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.710
Want a fudge?

01:25.760 --> 01:27.150
There you go.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.750
Enjoy.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.950
Can I just put all of this in an e-mail?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.670
Sorry, everyone.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.990
Puppy shat in my shoe. And
I trot in some more shit.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.630
Had to buy some emergency
pop socks at the station.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.630
Oh, well, at least they'll sort
out your deep vein thrombosis.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.230
Jesus, you look like
you've got prosthetic feet!

01:46.280 --> 01:47.670
My fuckwit of an ex-husband

01:47.720 --> 01:50.110
bought the kids a puppy,
so they wouldn't hate him.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.390
Hasn't worked. They're
bored of it already.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.870
Who's taking it to puppy classes?
Who's clearing up all the cack?

01:55.920 --> 01:57.230
Not all the cack,

01:57.280 --> 01:59.710
because you've brought quite
a lot of the cack to work.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.630
Who would have thought that so much

02:01.680 --> 02:04.910
- poo would come out of such a tiny anus?
- Well I'm sorry, Rose.

02:04.960 --> 02:08.430
But latecomers forfeit the
fruits of Fudge Friday.

02:08.479 --> 02:12.310
Christ! Since he got promoted,
Martin's gone all, by the book.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.670
Yeah, and all, buy a new suit.

02:14.720 --> 02:18.470
Got in the TARDIS and
gone back to 1996, BHS.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.590
At least he's making an effort.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.310
Rude. I stopped caring when
Jarvis Cocker grew a beard.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.870
Anyway, we've got paedophiles
roaming the borough. Now, what's

02:27.920 --> 02:30.550
- this random fudge thing?
- Did you make the fudge, Ing.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.030
Oh, no. I just gave the recipe to Martin.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.030
- I didn't have time to make it myself.
- I find that hard to believe.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.110
Well, I was preparing for my new arrival.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.070
- Getting a new cat?
- No, six is plenty!

02:40.120 --> 02:42.230
Don't want to be seen
as the crazy cat lady.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.470
Well that ship has sailed.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.470
Ing's taking on her
foster child, permanently.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.830
Is this the same foster kid
that stole your microwave?

02:48.880 --> 02:51.390
Limahl? Yes, yes it is, yes.
He brought it back though.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.440
He said he couldn't sell it
because it was too effing S H 1 T.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.310
His words, sort of.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.390
Elm Heath children's services.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.310
'Hello, yeah, I'm wondering if I
can get some extra benefits, as me

03:02.360 --> 03:05.630
'kid's autistic. What's the most
money you get for which disease?'

03:05.680 --> 03:08.070
'I'm sorry, but you are a fuck trumpet!'

03:08.120 --> 03:10.510
'Kids are out of nursery,
absolutely pissed.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.190
- 'Call me back please.'
- Yep, ta.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.670
So, what delights have
you got in your inbox?

03:15.720 --> 03:19.390
An 11-year-old girl whose
sexually abusing a 14-year-old boy,

03:19.440 --> 03:22.830
a drunk three-year-old,
and a bloke who claims

03:22.880 --> 03:26.150
he was groomed by a
sports coach in the 1980s.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.470
Oh, that's very on trend. He got a name?

03:29.520 --> 03:33.520
No, but he coached the Elm Heath
Strollers between '86 and '92.

03:34.280 --> 03:38.280
OK, here we go. There were three
youth coaches in the 1980s.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.270
Every single one of them
looks like a textbook paedo.

03:42.320 --> 03:46.230
I quite like that look. Sexy.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.390
Well, none of them are still coaching.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.630
So, it's historic.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.590
So that's one for the plods.

03:52.640 --> 03:56.030
Crossing it off my list, yes!

03:56.080 --> 03:58.790
I got a call about Tiara Branser.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.270
Is she known to us?

04:00.320 --> 04:04.070
- Mum's a sex worker.
- Well, that's not necessarily a crime.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.990
No, but we've had the tip-off that
the mum's working from home while

04:07.040 --> 04:09.070
- the kids are there.
- Which is a crime!

04:09.120 --> 04:11.950
Why don't you join in our private
conversation, Chief Wiggum?

04:12.000 --> 04:15.870
The caller reckons that some of the
clients are interested in Tiara.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.829
- How old is she?
- 13.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.950
And there's a boy around ten.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.390
Well, perhaps we'd
better pop around there.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.750
Just to check it's not some
nosy neighbour shit-stirring.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.350
Yeah, I'm on it. So how was last night?

04:29.400 --> 04:31.670
Wasn't Lee going to take
the kids to Pizza Hut?

04:31.720 --> 04:34.550
- Did you get some me time?
- Ha-ha(!) Did I fuck!

04:34.600 --> 04:37.230
He maxed out his credit card, again!

04:37.280 --> 04:40.630
How did you manage 15 years
married to that feckless wanker?

04:40.680 --> 04:43.910
Same way as you managed to
play house with Caitlin.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.960
Yeah, once the sex morphine wears
off, it's all downhill from there.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.550
Still, at least we got
a shot on them both.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.630
If I may add my penneth worth,

04:53.680 --> 04:56.910
I've always found that true
love transcends the physical.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.150
My wife and I were like chalk
and cheese in the bedroom.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.470
But we still had 24 blissful years.

05:03.520 --> 05:07.520
- OK, and then what?
- She died.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.990
What did your wife die of, Mart?

05:10.040 --> 05:12.870
Ah, well. Actually, Nat,
I'd rather not discuss it.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.030
Of course not. Sorry, Mart.

05:15.080 --> 05:19.080
Was it cancer?

05:22.880 --> 05:25.630
- Hello, Natalie Moor speaking.
- 'Yeah, can I speak to Pat Boone?'

05:25.680 --> 05:27.190
Pat Boone?

05:27.240 --> 05:28.310
'Pat Boone.'

05:28.360 --> 05:30.670
- No. - 'What about
Engelbert Humperdinck?'

05:30.720 --> 05:32.790
And here they are.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.950
Elm Heath's finest.
Everyone, this is Mimi.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.070
- Mimi, this is everyone.
- Hello, everyone.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.710
- Hey. - Hi. - I love that name.
That's what Mariah Carey calls

05:41.760 --> 05:43.950
herself on her album, The
Emancipation of Mimi.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.670
Thanks, but she's about as
emancipated as Disney's Pocahontas.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.670
- Ha!
- Yeah... Is that good or bad?

05:50.720 --> 05:52.990
Mimi is a student social worker,

05:53.040 --> 05:56.110
who is going to be shadowing
us for a few weeks.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.630
- Well, hopefully longer.
- Lovely...

05:57.680 --> 06:00.110
- If all goes well.
- So, one of you will be assigned as mentor.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.390
- Good, bring that on.
- Not you, Nitin.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.430
She'll be assigned to
a senior social worker.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.510
Alastair, Rose, Martin...
he's not here at the moment.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.910
He's in assessment. But
you'll meet him later.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.590
.. and Ingrid, are the candidates.

06:12.640 --> 06:16.190
Where is Ingrid? Is she still off
sick with her compromised uterus?

06:16.240 --> 06:19.910
No, she got a call from school
about her foster kid, Lahmal.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.910
Something about him selling
MDMA at Friday prayer club.

06:22.960 --> 06:26.960
- Jesus Christ!
- Actually, I think it's a (Muslim) club.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.390
Nat. You don't have to
whisper the word Muslim.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.070
It's not a swear, it's not
an offensive term, is it?

06:33.120 --> 06:36.630
I will observe your
interactions before I select.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.670
Don't select me. I'd be a shit mentor.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.270
I've post-menopausal
rage, most of the time.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.430
I can't even get my own
kids to clean their teeth.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.950
That's not a point of pride,
Rose. That's a form of abuse.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.110
So, just wanted to say,
thanks for having me.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.630
I'm here to learn from
you elder statespeople.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.670
- Respect. - Well, you can learn
where the kitchen is, if you'd like?

06:54.720 --> 06:57.110
- I'm just about to make a brew.
- No, you're all right, thanks.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.550
If you all wouldn't mind
filling out this questionnaire,

06:59.600 --> 07:02.870
just a few stupidly basic questions
about social work practice.

07:02.920 --> 07:06.550
We can probably paint a fairly
accurate verbal picture.

07:06.600 --> 07:10.150
Um... OK. Question one, what
do you think is the main impact

07:10.200 --> 07:13.510
of gender politics on 21st
century feminist social workers?

07:13.560 --> 07:15.990
Right, well that's a no-brainer, I think.

07:16.040 --> 07:20.030
But, I think I agree with...

07:20.080 --> 07:23.750
- What was the question?
- OK, well... I guess the Kuhnian paradigm shift

07:23.800 --> 07:27.590
in relation to feminist social
workers is a very current debate.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.670
However, I've just finished this
spirited fun conversation with a

07:30.720 --> 07:33.710
father of five, who has beaten up
his wife, pissed his benefits up the

07:33.760 --> 07:36.750
wall, and set fire to his dog.
So I think that, for today,

07:36.800 --> 07:40.230
the impact of gender politics is
taking something of the back seat.

07:40.280 --> 07:44.280
- All right. Al, bring the tone down.
- Al's very long in the tooth, Mimi.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.190
Mimi, come.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.750
You should get Denise to train your puppy.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.950
Why do we have to have the bloody
student sniffing around our desk?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.710
She's not going to sniff around
your desk, I'll tell you that right

07:59.760 --> 08:01.710
now. You've got a shitty
trainer underneath it!

08:01.760 --> 08:04.870
I can smell it from here! Can't you
just put it in a bag or something?

08:04.920 --> 08:06.950
Oh, all right! I'll run
a hot kettle over it.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.270
Wait! I read this life hack.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.950
The best way to get dog shit off a
trainer is to put it in the freezer.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.270
Then you just chip it
off with a matchstick.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.710
- Everything about that depresses me.
- Actually, it's strangely satisfying.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.870
I'm not saying that I
step in it deliberately,

08:18.920 --> 08:20.430
but now I don't mind when I do.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.670
- Christ... - Give us your trainer,
Rose, I'll lob it in the freezer.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.720
You can borrow my slippers, if you like?

08:33.299 --> 08:34.090
Hello?

08:34.840 --> 08:37.669
Hi, I'm Al Kavanagh. Are you Tiara?

08:37.720 --> 08:39.510
- Yes.
- Is your mum in?

08:39.559 --> 08:41.510
Maybe, she said come in and wait.

08:48.040 --> 08:51.190
Oh, thank you.

08:51.240 --> 08:55.240
- Why aren't you in school? - Still
on holidays. - Where's your mum?

08:55.640 --> 08:59.310
- Working. - Oh, so, she
works outside the house?

08:59.360 --> 09:03.360
She'll be back in a minute.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.880
Tiara, do you know what sort
of work it is your mum does?

09:10.840 --> 09:14.070
Kids, I'm back! Oh, shit.
Just give me a minute.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.870
Stay in there with your brother. ~

09:16.920 --> 09:20.350
And don't come into the massage
room, I'll be out in 15 minutes.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.270
Maybe ten.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.590
- That door there.
- No, I'm not here for that.

09:26.640 --> 09:30.270
Whatever, just get in there!

09:30.320 --> 09:33.670
So what do you want? Handjob,
blowjob, full sex, or anal for 50?

09:33.720 --> 09:37.720
No! I'm Al Kavanagh, I'm
from social services.

09:39.760 --> 09:43.470
If you want roleplay, there's
a gimp suit in the cupboard.

09:43.520 --> 09:47.520
No, I'm from... I'm from
actual social services.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.270
I think I should be given a shot.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.830
Through the head? Couldn't agree more.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.510
No, I think I might have something
to pass on to the new recruit.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.550
- Like Glandular fever?
- I'd be a good mentor!

09:58.600 --> 10:00.830
I'm efficient, my response
times are the fastest...

10:00.880 --> 10:02.190
And you wanting to mentor Mimi

10:02.240 --> 10:06.240
- has absolutely nothing to do
with you fancying her? - Pfft!

10:08.640 --> 10:10.510
Denise, seriously.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.470
My last girlfriend was a model.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.430
Couldn't you get a real one?

10:15.480 --> 10:17.310
No, like a lingerie model.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.910
Pants and vests.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.510
Oh, blooming bum holes!

10:21.560 --> 10:24.990
- Where are they?!
- Have you lost something?

10:25.040 --> 10:28.150
OK, all the old client records are
supposed to have been digitised when

10:28.200 --> 10:31.430
we moved offices, right? But there
were huge gaps in the computer data.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.710
So, they must've been put somewhere else.

10:33.760 --> 10:36.710
Well, what programme are you using?

10:36.760 --> 10:40.310
PC filing programme? Because that
data can be stored as the number

10:40.360 --> 10:44.360
of blocks, or a byte count,
or by the fast timestamp etc.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.310
So when you say that
some data's gone missing,

10:48.360 --> 10:51.790
all you really need to know is what
you're specifically looking for.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.630
- I'm looking for missing files.
- Yeah, OK.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.590
- Sorry! - Are you all right,
Martin? - That's hot...! God...!

10:58.640 --> 11:01.870
Knock-knock! Hiya, sorry, Denise
sent me here to get some ice.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.070
She banged her funny bone.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.230
Didn't know she had one!

11:04.280 --> 11:07.190
- Don't tell her I said that.
- Sorry, I haven't had the pleasure.

11:07.240 --> 11:09.830
- I'm Martin. Hello.
- This is Mimi. She's work experience.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.150
Student social worker.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.430
She's making everyone
fill in a questionnaire.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.030
Questionnaire? Well, off I toddle.

11:16.080 --> 11:20.080
Better get busy ticking
some of your boxes.

11:21.040 --> 11:25.040
So, can I get some ice?

11:27.040 --> 11:28.670
There's a shitty shoe in there.

11:28.720 --> 11:32.720
You should see what we've got
in the salad compartment.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.350
So is Martin the office sad sack?

11:35.400 --> 11:39.400
- There's always one.
- Martin's wife died of... a bad disease.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.230
So, don't put your nose in
where it's not welcomed.

11:44.280 --> 11:48.280
Or you might find it gets
chopped off, young madam!

11:50.280 --> 11:54.030
Darren, I'm sorry your coach
forced you to do those things.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.990
You've just got to go to the
police and report it to them.

11:58.040 --> 12:02.040
- We only deal with children here.
- I was a child!

12:02.280 --> 12:06.280
And I did try to tell people about
it at the time and no one...!

12:06.880 --> 12:10.880
- No one listened!
- Rose, Al's on line one for you.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.390
We just don't have the
resources to help you.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.030
Have you thought about therapy?

12:17.080 --> 12:18.910
I don't want therapy.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.990
- I want justice! - Sorry. You'll
just have to go to the police.

12:22.540 --> 12:26.040
Ro... Rose, it's urgent.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.990
- OK, I'll just transfer you.
- Look, this isn't working.

12:32.040 --> 12:35.150
- It's still caked in cack.
- Give it here, I'll put it back in.

12:35.200 --> 12:39.200
- It really pongs! - How am I supposed
to go home on the bus like this?

12:40.400 --> 12:44.400
- 'Hi Rose. It's Al. I need
some advice.' - Are you OK?

12:45.560 --> 12:49.560
- You sound shaky.
- I just got offered anal for 50 quid.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.990
Are your kids have school holidays?

12:52.040 --> 12:54.630
No, went back last week. I think
all the local schools did.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.670
- Why? - No, it's just that Branser
kids are at home with their mum.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.750
What? And she's seeing clients there?

13:00.800 --> 13:04.800
- Shit! Is there any sign of drugs?
- She's not puffing on a crack pipe...

13:05.360 --> 13:08.990
Al, this is Martin, you are
the duty social worker.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.590
Get a grip!

13:10.640 --> 13:13.950
- Martin? - I'm sending the police
down there to remove the children under

13:14.000 --> 13:16.590
a PPO. Once you have handed the
children over to the police,

13:16.640 --> 13:19.990
I want you back here
straightaway. Thank you.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.670
Rose, find out where the
Branser children go to school.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.230
And Greg, bring the headteacher
in. Right, let's get ready for an

13:26.280 --> 13:29.580
emergency child protection
conference. Chop-chop!

13:31.200 --> 13:33.670
- Is this really necessary?
- What's going on?

13:33.720 --> 13:35.430
Can you at least tell me
what have I done wrong?

13:35.480 --> 13:36.830
Please just get in the car.

13:36.880 --> 13:40.880
What is this? I have the right to know.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.670
Jesus, always weirds me out
how fast you guys turn up.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.830
The Elm Heath social services, right?

13:56.880 --> 13:58.550
Oh, God, know it well, mate.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.630
Lee? What the fuck!

14:00.680 --> 14:03.190
Oh, bollocks, what are
you doing round here?

14:03.240 --> 14:04.750
Don't tell Rose I picked you up.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.230
Lee, mate, really,

14:06.280 --> 14:08.350
does she know you're
using her car as an Uber?

14:08.400 --> 14:09.870
I'm just trying to earn a living.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.910
- Where are you living?
- Oh, didn't Rose say?

14:11.960 --> 14:15.960
Moved back in.

14:17.480 --> 14:20.270
All right, so we all think it's all
right for kids to hear mum and dad

14:20.320 --> 14:22.390
having miserable married sex, is it?

14:22.440 --> 14:24.670
Just not consensual sex for money.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.190
And, by the way,

14:26.240 --> 14:29.150
it is not illegal for the mother
to conduct her business at home.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.710
Unless there's a pimp. If
there's a pimp, it's illegal.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.910
- That's the law.
- Thanks for mansplaining that.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.350
Mimi. Shhh.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.750
There's no evidence of any pimps
or any abuse to the children.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.150
Although the children were alone

14:40.200 --> 14:43.310
and gave you instant access
to the flat, which is neglect.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.950
Well, exactly, I need to conduct
a full assessment of each child

14:47.000 --> 14:49.150
to determine the level of mental trauma.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.870
They might not have suffered any trauma.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.870
Not suffered any trauma?
Their mam's a proz,

14:52.920 --> 14:55.630
banging punters and slapping arses
while the kids watch cartoons.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.110
Who called us about the Bransers?

14:57.160 --> 14:58.430
A neighbour on the estate.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.710
He gave Tiara a lift home
today and he was concerned...

15:00.760 --> 15:02.670
How do you know Mr Nosy
Neighbour's not a nonce?

15:02.720 --> 15:04.070
They're cunning, these paedos.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.750
They're cunning enough to phone
children's social services?

15:06.800 --> 15:08.070
It's probably a double bluff.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.110
How long have the Bransers
been in the local area?

15:10.160 --> 15:12.710
Been here for years, ever since
Elena arrived from Romania.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.870
Well, she's an illegal, of course.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.310
They're all in the bloody
game, them lot. Send her back.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.270
Thank you, Brexit.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.590
Are you for real?

15:20.640 --> 15:22.550
No, h-he's a stripper off a hen night.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.670
That was uncalled for.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.630
The kids' dad is British.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.270
They are UK citizens.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.510
Look, I am sorry to be the one

15:28.560 --> 15:30.470
presenting the uncomfortable statistic,

15:30.520 --> 15:33.470
but children of sex workers are
more likely to become sex workers.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.790
Oh, my God, why are we all acting

15:34.840 --> 15:37.590
- like sex work is a negative profession?
- Mimi, please.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.630
- No, she's got a point.
- Really?

15:39.680 --> 15:40.670
Yeah.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.710
It's far better to bang a prozzie than

15:42.760 --> 15:44.670
rape an innocent woman and, you know...

15:44.720 --> 15:46.990
OK, th-that's not what I
meant. Don't write that down.

15:47.040 --> 15:51.040
Elena Branser was sex
trafficked from Bucharest at 14.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.230
This is a child protection
conference, Alastair,

15:54.280 --> 15:56.270
not an episode of Who
Do You Think You Are?

15:56.320 --> 16:00.320
Get Martin to bring her in.

16:10.320 --> 16:14.320
What?

16:17.360 --> 16:18.790
Miss Branser,

16:18.840 --> 16:22.750
it's important you understand
your choice of profession

16:22.800 --> 16:26.150
is not under scrutiny today.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.590
Uh, Marcus Bowles,
headmaster. Have a seat.

16:28.640 --> 16:31.230
- Hello. - Hello! - Sit down.

16:31.280 --> 16:34.550
I'm so sorry. Traffic from the
airport was an absolute fiasco.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.270
- Been anywhere nice?
- Oh, just Tuscany.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.910
Uh, we've got a little place.
Yeah, it's very rudimentary,

16:39.960 --> 16:42.910
but it's, um...

16:42.960 --> 16:45.870
.. it's, uh, it's...

16:45.920 --> 16:48.510
- So how can I help?
- Well, you're familiar with Miss Branser,

16:48.560 --> 16:50.190
- Tiara and Bailey's mother?
- Yeah.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.150
Are you aware they are truanting?

16:52.200 --> 16:53.790
They've never truanted.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.950
Well, they've not actually
started at school yet.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.150
Term doesn't begin for another week, so...

16:59.200 --> 17:02.150
Mine are back, so are all the
other schools round here.

17:02.200 --> 17:05.990
Yes, well, we set our own
calendar at Greybridge House.

17:06.040 --> 17:09.150
Greybridge, er, the private co-ed?

17:09.200 --> 17:12.430
Yes, I worked with a couple of
lovely bulimics there recently.

17:12.480 --> 17:16.069
That's so weird, cos food's usually
really nice at posh places.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.230
Uh, sorry...

17:18.280 --> 17:19.710
.. is there a problem?

17:19.760 --> 17:23.310
We are here to determine whether
the children, especially Tiara,

17:23.359 --> 17:27.270
are at risk of CSE because
their mother is an FSW.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.990
Sorry, I'm a little bit
rusty with the old acronyms.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.510
CSE -- child sexual exploitation.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.230
Er, FSW...

17:35.280 --> 17:38.110
Hang on.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.310
FSW -- female sex worker.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.360
Sorry, so who's a sex worker?

17:47.480 --> 17:48.910
Ohhh.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.310
OK.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.550
Sweets?

17:51.600 --> 17:53.710
- No, thanks.
- We're not allowed to.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.030
Stranger danger.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.870
But I'm a social worker, so it's fine.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.030
You can have a sweet.

18:00.080 --> 18:04.080
- Go on. - Oh, my God, you
are totally weirding me out.

18:07.360 --> 18:11.110
The children were only home because
of the longer school holidays.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.710
After next week, they won't
even be there when I'm working.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.110
Look, prostitution is not
an acceptable occupation

18:17.160 --> 18:18.910
for a solo primary carer.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.350
That's so whorephobic.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.190
- Bitch fight.
- I'm a sex-positive feminist.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.430
I don't believe that men
want sex and women endure it.

18:24.480 --> 18:27.030
Well, I have every sympathy
with any young woman

18:27.080 --> 18:29.150
who's forced into a life
of danger and penury,

18:29.200 --> 18:31.070
but where there are children involved...

18:31.120 --> 18:33.430
Oh, don't go all I,
Daniel Blake on us, mate.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.950
Most of the girls we see are
smacked off their tits anyway.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.350
Slut-shamer.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.950
But Denise, 38% of sex
workers have a degree.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.190
Where is that statistic from?

18:41.240 --> 18:43.350
I mean, who here hasn't
had transactional sex

18:43.400 --> 18:45.830
- to pay their way through uni?
- Oh, fuck off! - I haven't.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.750
You know fuck all with your statistics.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.750
- That's right.
- I'm not ashamed of what I do, OK?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.750
I also work on a zero-hours contract,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.030
cleaning filthy toilets in a hospital.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.710
Is that acceptable?

18:57.760 --> 19:00.510
It's certainly not going to pay
for my kids' education, is it?

19:00.560 --> 19:02.910
No, really...

19:02.960 --> 19:06.710
Look, Elena, our only concern is
for the safety of your children.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.550
They are not at risk.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.350
Look, we're told we intervene too
often, sometimes too readily...

19:12.400 --> 19:15.510
And what is your suggested
alternative, Alastair? I'm all ears.

19:15.560 --> 19:18.030
I promise you, the kids have seen nothing.

19:18.080 --> 19:22.080
He knows that. He's
been in my massage room.

19:22.520 --> 19:26.030
Just to clarify, I made a home visit

19:26.080 --> 19:29.950
and I was locked inside the, um...

19:30.000 --> 19:32.830
.. sex room before she, Elena,

19:32.880 --> 19:34.750
realised that I was not a client.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.270
Oh, well...

19:36.320 --> 19:37.350
You dirty dog.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.470
Oh, I have to go,

19:40.520 --> 19:43.630
I have a trans kid with
a shank on a psych ward.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.870
A lamb shank?

19:45.920 --> 19:47.390
Miss Branser,

19:47.440 --> 19:50.470
have your clients ever directly expressed

19:50.520 --> 19:53.870
sexual interest in either
of your children, yes or no?

19:53.920 --> 19:55.630
No.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.830
But, with the children on the premises,

19:57.880 --> 19:59.590
you have had paid intercourse.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.910
Yes, but it's not even always intercourse.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.550
One bloke just wants
me to stamp on his cock.

20:05.600 --> 20:06.590
Oh.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.790
Right, well, I think it's best for now

20:08.840 --> 20:11.310
if we remove the children
with immediate effect.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.110
- No. - Martin, please raise the child
protection order. - Please don't.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.630
- Meeting adjourned.
- Please don't. I am a good mother.

20:16.680 --> 20:20.680
- It's just temporary. - I-I can
take care of my children. - Elena...

20:24.960 --> 20:28.870
- Tiara.
- What's happening?

20:28.920 --> 20:30.830
Listen to me. It's OK.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.150
Mum is going to come for you, understand?

20:33.200 --> 20:34.950
Mum is going to come back for you.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.670
Come here, buddy.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.270
Come here, buddy, don't be sad.

20:39.560 --> 20:40.950
- Where are we going?
- I'm sorry...

20:41.000 --> 20:42.750
~

20:42.800 --> 20:44.110
Don't leave us.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.150
- You'll see them soon.
- You take care of him.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.870
Don't touch me!

20:48.920 --> 20:52.920
~

20:58.160 --> 21:01.310
Oh, hey.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.910
- All got a bit intense in
there, didn't it? - Yeah. - Ah.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.030
So where will they go now, the kids?

21:07.080 --> 21:08.750
They'll go to their grandmother's

21:08.800 --> 21:11.510
- til we determine the best
course of action. - Right.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.630
Good.

21:12.680 --> 21:16.680
But it shouldn't affect them
starting in your school next week.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.070
Right, so they...

21:18.120 --> 21:19.510
Yeah, OK.

21:19.560 --> 21:23.070
Well, you know, it's a bit
awkward, actually, because, um,

21:23.120 --> 21:24.870
there has been a monumental cock-up.

21:24.920 --> 21:28.910
See, I spoke to my secretary and we
thought the Bransers were confirmed,

21:28.960 --> 21:30.550
but it turns out we've

21:30.600 --> 21:33.110
overestimated the number of
sibling places available, so...

21:33.160 --> 21:34.710
Sorry, I don't follow.

21:34.760 --> 21:38.270
We'll be putting Bailey and
Tiara back on the waiting list.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.030
So you find out their mum's a sex worker

21:40.080 --> 21:43.070
and suddenly they're not good enough
for Grey-fuckers House, is that it?

21:43.120 --> 21:44.830
Look, come on, don't be unpleasant.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.910
You should be ashamed of yourself.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.710
I have 600 other families
to take into consideration.

21:49.760 --> 21:53.760
Is that all?

21:55.760 --> 21:58.030
Well, it's been a twatter
of a day and I for one

21:58.080 --> 21:59.910
was ready to get the hell out of Dodge,

21:59.960 --> 22:02.110
but like the diligent student that she is,

22:02.160 --> 22:04.310
Mimi's reminded me it's
time to choose her mentor,

22:04.360 --> 22:05.630
so let the fun begin.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.590
Yes, and thank you to everyone
who filled out my questionnaire.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.630
I think it was only Martin, wasn't it?

22:10.680 --> 22:13.630
I think Rose and Alastair
couldn't be arsed and Ingrid,

22:13.680 --> 22:15.950
I disqualified her on the
grounds that she's Ingrid,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.390
so well done, Martin!

22:17.440 --> 22:18.910
You got the job.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.590
- Oh!
- What?

22:20.640 --> 22:24.640
You may not have got the popular
vote, but that's who you're having.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.350
All right, who fancies a pint of wine?

22:30.400 --> 22:32.470
Not going to get back for your kids?

22:32.520 --> 22:34.830
Well, they're in semi-capable hands.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.270
Why didn't you tell me
Lee had moved back in?

22:37.320 --> 22:39.030
I thought you'd disapprove.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.390
Do you know he gave me a lift today?

22:41.440 --> 22:43.430
A lift? But he hasn't got a car.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.390
I know, that's why he's using your car

22:45.440 --> 22:47.110
in his new career as an Uber driver.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.470
The little fucker.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.670
'Hi, this is Lee's phone. Do the thing.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.710
Lee. Rose.

22:52.760 --> 22:56.760
You're dead.
