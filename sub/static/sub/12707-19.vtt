00:01.034 --> 00:03.137
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.871
BUFFY:
Tell me what kind of demon
I'm fighting.

00:04.971 --> 00:07.208
TRAVERS:
Glory isn't a demon.
She's a god.

00:07.240 --> 00:11.544
We had to hide the key.
Made it human
and sent it to you.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.714
-Dawn.
-I'm not real.

00:13.746 --> 00:14.747
You're the key.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.885
Go. Before she finds you.
She's here.

00:17.917 --> 00:21.355
I won't help her find the key.
I would never do that
to an innocent--

00:21.388 --> 00:25.024
-An innocent?
-It's not a person.

00:25.059 --> 00:28.696
-What about the key?
-He indicated
that it was a person.

00:28.728 --> 00:30.763
I'll tell you
who the sodding key is.

00:30.797 --> 00:33.866
The vampire is lying to me.

00:33.901 --> 00:37.871
The Slayer is going to kick
your lopsided ass.

00:50.651 --> 00:54.421
-Professor Lillian?
-Buffy.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.890
I'm sorry that I missed
the lecture today.

00:56.923 --> 00:57.890
Was it good?

00:58.959 --> 01:01.695
Um, of course it was.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.397
Do you want me to try?

01:04.432 --> 01:08.701
Yes, thanks.
The slide is stuck
in the... thing.

01:08.736 --> 01:12.472
Okay. Um, I just
came by to tell you

01:12.506 --> 01:14.742
that, uh, I have
to drop this class.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.412
Um, all my classes,
actually.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.713
I'm not finishing
the semester.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.817
I wish, um--

01:23.850 --> 01:26.219
I just-- I can't be
in school right now.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.989
I have to take care
of my sister.

01:29.021 --> 01:31.292
Yes, I--
I thought you might.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.164
I was very sorry
to hear about your loss.

01:38.765 --> 01:43.003
Um, I have these forms
from the registrar's office
that I need you to sign.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.972
Oh. Yes.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.979
Thanks.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.121
Is there something else?

02:02.156 --> 02:03.490
No.

02:04.557 --> 02:06.493
Yes. Yeah.

02:06.527 --> 02:11.931
Um, I wanted to tell you
how much I enjoyed this class.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.835
I mean, I know that
I wasn't the best student,

02:14.867 --> 02:16.903
but I really learned a lot.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.441
And I really like poetry.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.709
I really do.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.978
Ooh. Sorry.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.981
I'm glad you
like poetry, Buffy.

02:29.015 --> 02:33.820
I wish I had time for it,
but I just don't right now.

02:33.853 --> 02:36.824
Well, maybe short poems.

02:36.856 --> 02:42.229
Yeah, like those Japanese ones
that, um, sound like a sneeze.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.031
-Haiku?
-Right.

02:44.063 --> 02:45.633
Maybe those.

02:45.665 --> 02:49.537
And hopefully,
I'll be back next semester

02:49.569 --> 02:51.338
when I'm more myself again.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.140
(sighs)
Benjamin.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.977
This is a pleasant surprise.

02:57.009 --> 03:00.413
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-You're not late.

03:00.448 --> 03:04.252
-But, sir--
-You can't be late
to a job that you don't have.

03:04.284 --> 03:06.554
Interestingly enough,
I've decided to give your job

03:06.586 --> 03:09.188
to someone
who will actually do it.

03:09.223 --> 03:12.693
Honest to God, Ben.
I've been calling you
for two weeks.

03:12.725 --> 03:15.094
Where the hell you been?
I didn't wanna--

03:15.127 --> 03:18.598
I'm sorry to fire you,
but I need somebody
I can count on.

03:18.632 --> 03:22.502
I haven't been here--
I haven't been here
in two weeks.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.504
There's an explanation
for this,

03:24.538 --> 03:28.074
which I can't exactly
give you.

03:28.108 --> 03:31.278
I-- Can I just tell you
it's not my fault?

03:33.281 --> 03:37.116
Sure.
You can also tell me that
the dog ate your homework

03:37.150 --> 03:40.120
or maybe eating Twinkies
made you do it

03:40.152 --> 03:43.723
Or maybe, yeah,
that there's really
a wicked, demonic creature

03:43.757 --> 03:45.893
living inside you
that takes control
of your body

03:45.925 --> 03:47.860
and forces you
to do its bidding.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.228
(sighs)

03:49.263 --> 03:53.033
Take responsibility
for your actions, Ben.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.802
I-- This--

03:55.836 --> 03:59.072
You know, forget it.
Just forget it.

03:59.105 --> 04:01.375
This is so unfair.
You're taking everything
away from me.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.144
Everything I worked for,
I earned, I care about.

04:04.176 --> 04:07.414
These are my choices.
This is my life,
and you're ruining it.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.651
No. No.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.421
Not here. Not now. Please.

04:14.455 --> 04:17.625
I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.892
I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.262
I'm Ben! I'm Ben!

04:25.932 --> 04:27.800
I'm hungry.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.838
(theme music plays)

05:23.723 --> 05:27.694
Ahh. They got
this part right,
that's for sure.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.963
Lot of sucky things
in this dimension.

05:29.997 --> 05:33.401
Bubble baths?
Not one of 'em.

05:33.433 --> 05:34.968
Know what I mean?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.237
I am in thunderous
agreement,

05:37.269 --> 05:40.072
oh glittering,
glistening Glorificus.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.975
I wasn't
talking to you.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.713
Uh, begging your pardon,
and begging in general,

05:45.745 --> 05:47.680
but were you
talking to me?

05:47.715 --> 05:49.750
Eww. Yeah, right.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.884
Like any of you
have ever bathed anyway.

05:51.918 --> 05:55.154
Oh, but we do,
Your Scrumptiousness.

05:55.187 --> 05:58.425
We bathe in your splendiferous
radiance, your aromatic--

05:58.459 --> 06:02.262
How 'bout
you shut up and listen to me,
you disgusting little fools?

06:02.295 --> 06:06.233
Okay. Now I asked
for the key,

06:06.266 --> 06:09.002
and you brought me
a vampire.

06:09.036 --> 06:13.072
A pulseless, impure,
follicley-fried vampire.

06:13.105 --> 06:14.975
-Loofah.
-Oh.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.678
So, what I think we have here

06:18.711 --> 06:21.380
is a failure for you
to do your frickin' jobs!

06:21.415 --> 06:23.584
Pardon my French.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.485
Mimosa.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.288
Mmm.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.360
Vitamins.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.863
So, I think you better rack
your little minion brains

06:36.896 --> 06:41.201
and tell me everything you saw
when you were spying on Buffy
and her wacky pals.

06:41.233 --> 06:43.269
Everything. Mmm.

06:43.302 --> 06:45.805
Then I'll figure out
who the key is.

06:45.838 --> 06:48.408
BUFFY:
You lied to me?

06:48.442 --> 06:51.545
I didn't lie e-- exactly.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.312
Really?

06:53.346 --> 06:56.082
What about all the times
I asked you how school was,
and you said, "Fine"?

06:56.115 --> 06:58.384
Well, it was.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.855
You didn't ask
if I was in it
when it was fine.

07:01.954 --> 07:05.793
(sighs)
I-I don't know
what to say.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.427
I'm sure you're aware
that the past few months,

07:08.461 --> 07:10.930
you know, have been
kind of hard for Dawn.

07:10.963 --> 07:13.000
Not that I'm saying
that's an excuse.

07:13.033 --> 07:17.771
I understand. Your mother
was a lovely woman, and we'll
all miss her very much.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.839
I know how difficult
it must be.

07:19.872 --> 07:25.077
It is, especially for Dawn.
She's just a kid.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.781
Well, I think
we both know

07:28.815 --> 07:32.151
that Dawn is a lot more
than just a kid.

07:35.956 --> 07:39.659
She's a talented young girl
with a sharp mind

07:39.692 --> 07:41.694
when she puts the effort in.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.999
Look, I realize
that there's been
some ball-dropping,

07:46.033 --> 07:48.034
but I'm sure
this will all--

07:48.067 --> 07:50.737
Dawn, why don't you
wait outside
for a few minutes?

08:01.348 --> 08:02.850
(door opens)

08:04.151 --> 08:05.685
(door closes)

08:22.536 --> 08:26.305
Honey, old saying: "A watched
customer never buys."

08:26.338 --> 08:28.542
They would
if they were patriotic.

08:30.377 --> 08:33.980
Okay, I'm going in.
Patriotic?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.482
Yes. I've recently
come to realize

08:36.515 --> 08:38.552
there's more to me
than just being human.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.053
I'm also
an American.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.724
Yes, I suppose you are,
in a manner of speaking.

08:43.756 --> 08:47.059
You were born here--
your mortal self.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.562
Well, that's right,
foreigner.

08:49.596 --> 08:52.566
So I've been
reading a lot about
the good ol' US of A,

08:52.600 --> 08:54.768
embracing
the extraordinarily
precious ideology

08:54.802 --> 08:57.004
that's helped
to shape and define it.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.172
-Democracy?
-Capitalism:

08:59.206 --> 09:02.542
A free market dependent
on the profitable exchange
of goods for currency,

09:02.576 --> 09:05.745
a system of symbiotic
beauty apparently lost
on these old people.

09:05.778 --> 09:08.716
Look at 'em--
Perusing the shelves,

09:08.749 --> 09:11.384
undressing the merchandise
with their eyeballs--

09:11.418 --> 09:13.620
All ogle, no cash.

09:13.653 --> 09:16.923
It's not just annoying.
It's un-American.

09:16.956 --> 09:22.095
Appalling. Almost as if
they no longer think
money can buy happiness.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.898
Totally
un-American.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.466
You know what else
is un-American?
French people.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.870
-You don't say?
-From what I hear,
they don't tip.

09:30.903 --> 09:34.774
Now, French old people--
that's really the bottom
of the barrel, you know?

09:34.807 --> 09:39.111
An, how's about we try
being a bit less prejudiced
and a bit more inclusive?

09:39.145 --> 09:42.548
Not us, just you.

09:42.581 --> 09:45.653
Fine. I'm gonna make
those fogies buy things.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.197
Hey, what's up?
It's Dawn Giovanni
and the Buffster.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.433
-Hi.
-Hey, everybody.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.436
I trust everything
went well at university.

10:03.470 --> 10:06.105
Yep. I'm, uh,
all dropped out.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.975
Good on you.
Welcome to
the real world.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.946
Lot of fun to be had
on the outside. You'll see.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.649
Well, it's just for now.
I'm thinking that I'm probably
gonna go back next semester.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.586
And that's cool too.
Whatever you choose,
you've got my support.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.956
Just think of me as...

10:22.990 --> 10:26.625
as your...

10:26.659 --> 10:29.596
you know, I'm searching
for supportive things,
and I'm coming up all bras.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.832
So, something
slightly more manly,
think of me as that.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.203
Seriously,
whatever you need.

10:37.236 --> 10:41.540
Thank you.
Actually, I need to talk
to Giles alone for a minute.

10:41.573 --> 10:44.543
XANDER:
Cool. That's cool.

10:44.576 --> 10:47.480
Uh, Dawn, why don't you get
started on your homework?

10:47.514 --> 10:49.883
Uh, if you need help,
Wil, could you--

10:52.251 --> 10:53.186
Okay.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.726
I just don't know
what I'm gonna do.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.227
She's messing up.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.797
I'm messing up.
It's a mess.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.332
You're just going to have to
put your foot down with her.

11:06.365 --> 11:11.504
I try. It's just my foot's
not used to being put down.

11:11.538 --> 11:16.176
I want you to do it. You can
be the foot putting-downer.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.311
No, Buffy,
I don't think I can.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.880
Please?
Pretty please?

11:20.913 --> 11:23.216
I mean, your foot
is way bigger than mine,

11:23.250 --> 11:27.320
and you're so much
more a grown-up than me.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.657
Dawn needs an authority figure,
a strong guiding hand.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.259
-She'll listen to you.
-(scoffs)

11:32.292 --> 11:34.594
Just like
you always have.

11:34.626 --> 11:36.062
I listen.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.799
I do.

11:42.068 --> 11:45.404
Well, then perk up your ears.

11:45.437 --> 11:48.908
I may be a grown-up,
but you're her family.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.445
Her only
real family now.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.981
She needs you
to do this.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.052
Right.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.087
She needs me.

12:02.554 --> 12:04.957
Me, the grown-up,

12:04.991 --> 12:08.260
the authority figure,
the strong guiding hand,

12:08.294 --> 12:10.764
and stompy foot that is me.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.465
That's the spirit.

12:13.666 --> 12:17.203
Okay. I can do this.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.938
I know you can.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.241
-Please?
-No.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.914
Okay. Here we go.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.719
Early to bed,
early to rise.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.822
Balanced breakfasts,
hospital corners.
It's a new beginning.

12:35.855 --> 12:39.658
Discipline,
authority, order.

12:39.692 --> 12:42.394
(laughter)

12:42.428 --> 12:45.966
What is this?
I thought I told you
to do your homework.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.369
-I was.
-Please don't lie to me.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.604
I'm not.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.605
We were acting out
a geometry problem,

12:53.639 --> 12:55.674
'cause I read this
really neat article

12:55.707 --> 12:58.110
that said
kids learn math better

12:58.144 --> 13:01.581
if you stimulate their,
uh, visual learning pattern.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.682
You know,
using the right side
of the brain

13:03.716 --> 13:05.784
instead of
just the left?

13:05.818 --> 13:07.821
-Stuff like that.
-Uh-huh.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.157
So, we made a triangle
with our bodies,

13:10.190 --> 13:13.826
and that's when
I called Xander obtuse,
and he got really grumpy,

13:13.860 --> 13:15.928
and then Dawn said
we were "acute"
triangle,

13:15.962 --> 13:19.166
and, well,
hilarity ensued.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.934
Right. Well,
you know what I think?

13:21.969 --> 13:25.172
I think maybe Dawn should
do her homework at home.

13:27.875 --> 13:31.344
B-But it was working.
I was really learning.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.913
Please get your stuff.

13:35.548 --> 13:38.184
Fine.
Don't listen to me.

13:38.217 --> 13:39.818
Please don't be
grouchy with her.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.456
Who among us can
resist the allure

13:43.490 --> 13:46.192
of really funny
math puns?

13:46.225 --> 13:48.861
It's really important
that Dawn finishes
her schoolwork right now.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.998
Yeah, I know, but...

13:51.030 --> 13:53.332
we were having good,
clean, educational fun,

13:53.365 --> 13:55.302
and then all of the sudden,
it was all gloom and doom

13:55.335 --> 13:58.471
and the outlawing
of human triangles.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.572
It's really important

14:00.606 --> 14:02.875
that Dawn finishes
her schoolwork right now.

14:02.909 --> 14:05.879
I know it is,
and I'm a big fan
of school.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.346
You know me. I'm like...

14:07.379 --> 14:09.182
* Go school,
It's your birthday *

14:09.216 --> 14:11.985
or something
to that effect.

14:12.019 --> 14:15.488
Look, Willow,
I know that you mean well,
but you just don't understand.

14:15.522 --> 14:19.591
-And there's no way
that you could.
-I do so understand, and...

14:19.625 --> 14:22.062
-you're stressed out.
-I'm more than stressed out.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.931
I'm freaked out.

14:25.532 --> 14:29.269
Yeah.
Well, maybe you need
a break to de-freak.

14:29.302 --> 14:33.206
Hey, you could go to
the World Culture Fair if
you want to with me and Tara.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.741
-I don't think so.
-Come on.

14:35.774 --> 14:37.277
You can bring Dawn.

14:37.309 --> 14:40.679
It'll be fun. Good,
educational-type fun

14:40.712 --> 14:43.283
in a discipliney
sort of way.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.451
I can't do it, Wil.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.455
Don't worry. It's not like
I don't have a life.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.323
I do. I have Dawn's life.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.827
Ready?

14:59.231 --> 15:02.601
So it's her.
Under our noses all this time.

15:02.634 --> 15:05.871
I like the detail work
those monks did.

15:05.904 --> 15:08.640
Quirks, foibles, passions.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.610
It's all so cute, so...

15:10.643 --> 15:13.279
human, you know?

15:13.312 --> 15:16.482
Pretty convincing,
really.

15:16.515 --> 15:19.519
But not convincing enough.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.961
You all know
your assignments.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.998
I think it's time
to collect the key.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.940
It wasn't anything,
really.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.344
Buffy was just
a little crabby at Dawn
about her schoolwork.

15:44.376 --> 15:47.514
-Well, it's understandable.
-Yeah, sure it is.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.649
I'd totally be
blowing off classes

15:49.682 --> 15:51.283
if I were
in Dawnie's shoes.

15:51.317 --> 15:54.287
Sweetie,
you wouldn't blow off a class
if your head was on fire.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.655
And I meant Buffy.

15:56.688 --> 16:01.260
-Buffy what?
-Understandable--
about the crabby.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.962
She has to look
after Dawn now.

16:03.996 --> 16:08.668
Well, yeah, but not in
a Miss-Minchin's-Select-
Seminary-For-Girls way.

16:08.701 --> 16:12.205
I mean, she's just gonna
make Dawnie more rebellious.

16:12.239 --> 16:15.475
I had to deal with
my brother's problems
after--

16:15.508 --> 16:18.811
I mean, you can't really
know what it's like to--

16:18.845 --> 16:20.080
Yeah, I know that.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.386
-I-- I didn't mean to--
-No, I just--

16:27.419 --> 16:30.657
I know I can't know
what you went through.

16:31.990 --> 16:36.296
But I just--
It's no big.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.298
-I made you mad.
-No. No.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.000
-All I meant was that--
-No, it's okay.

16:41.033 --> 16:44.303
This whole Buffy thing,
let's just forget it.

16:44.336 --> 16:48.240
No, please.
I mean-- I mean, tell me
if I said something wrong.

16:48.274 --> 16:52.544
Otherwise,
I know I'll say it again,
probably often and in public.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.547
No, I was snippy gal.

16:54.581 --> 17:00.352
It's just... I know
I can't on some level--

17:00.386 --> 17:03.556
It's like my opinion
isn't worth anything

17:03.590 --> 17:07.358
because I haven't
been through...

17:07.394 --> 17:11.564
I didn't lose my mom,
so I-- I don't know.

17:11.597 --> 17:14.665
Wil, I'm not the expert.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.136
I mean,
I've only lost the one.

17:22.942 --> 17:27.713
Do I act like
the big knowledge woman?

17:29.615 --> 17:31.218
No.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.685
Is that "no"
spelled Y-E-S?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.021
S-O-R-T of.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.226
I mean,
I just feel like

17:39.259 --> 17:42.295
the-- the junior partner.

17:42.328 --> 17:45.298
You've been doing
everything longer
than me.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.099
You've been out
longer,

17:47.134 --> 17:50.202
you've been practicing
witchcraft way longer.

17:50.237 --> 17:53.772
Oh, but you're way
beyond me there.
In just a few--

17:53.806 --> 17:58.644
I mean, it-- it frightens me
how powerful you're getting.

17:58.677 --> 18:01.347
That's a weird word.

18:02.914 --> 18:04.983
"Getting"?

18:05.017 --> 18:07.453
It frightens you?

18:07.487 --> 18:09.556
I frighten you?

18:09.588 --> 18:13.660
That is so not what I meant.
I meant it impresses--
impressive.

18:13.692 --> 18:15.827
Well, I took Psych 101.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.798
I mean, I took it
from an evil government
scientist...

18:18.830 --> 18:22.169
who was skewered by her
Frankenstein-like creation
before the final,

18:22.201 --> 18:24.770
but I know
what a Freudian slip is.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.075
D-- Don't you trust me?

18:29.107 --> 18:32.811
-With my life.
-That's not what I mean.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.647
Can't we just go to the fair?

18:35.682 --> 18:38.550
I don't feel real
multicultural right now.

18:41.153 --> 18:44.590
What is it about me
that you don't trust?

18:44.624 --> 18:48.461
It's not that.
I worry sometimes.

18:48.494 --> 18:52.664
You're changing so much,
so fast.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.967
I don't know
where you're heading.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.604
-Where I'm heading?
-I'm saying everything wrong.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.638
No, I think you're
being pretty clear.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.641
This isn't about
the witch thing.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.710
It's about the other
changes in my life.

19:03.742 --> 19:07.213
I trust you. I just--

19:07.247 --> 19:11.116
I don't know where I'm gonna
fit in in your life when--

19:11.150 --> 19:13.185
When...
I change back?

19:13.220 --> 19:16.021
Yeah, this is
a college thing,

19:16.055 --> 19:18.557
just a little
experimentation

19:18.590 --> 19:22.528
before I get over the thrill
and head back to Boys Town.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.833
You think that?

19:26.865 --> 19:29.368
Should I?

19:29.402 --> 19:33.740
I'm really sorry
that I didn't establish
my lesbo street cred

19:33.772 --> 19:36.075
before I got into
this relationship.

19:38.577 --> 19:41.413
You're the only woman
I've ever fallen in love with,

19:41.448 --> 19:46.018
so how on earth
could you ever
take me seriously?

19:46.051 --> 19:49.188
-Willow, please.
-Have fun at the fair.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.667
Okay, so I think
the next step

20:01.701 --> 20:04.570
is to make a chart,
a schedule.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.606
I'll write down all the things
you're supposed to do
and when you have to do them,

20:07.640 --> 20:09.709
and then I'll
leave a box next to it,

20:09.741 --> 20:12.044
which you can mark
with an "X" when you've
accomplished the task.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.682
What? You want gold stars?

20:16.715 --> 20:19.018
Okay, you can have
gold stars.

20:19.050 --> 20:22.054
I don't want
gold stars.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.056
I don't want
any of this.

20:26.593 --> 20:30.096
I'm just trying
to give you a normal life.

20:30.128 --> 20:31.931
Good luck.

20:36.836 --> 20:41.407
What? What am I
doing wrong now?

20:41.441 --> 20:43.576
This is for real,
Dawn.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.613
No, it's not.

20:46.645 --> 20:50.317
I'm not real, so why
would my exciting graph
of chores be real?

20:50.349 --> 20:52.919
Who cares if a key
gets an education,
anyway?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.657
It's a chart,
not a graph.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.394
-And you are real.
-Yeah?

21:01.428 --> 21:03.996
Those monks put
grades K through eight
in my head.

21:04.029 --> 21:06.432
Can't we just wait and see
if they drop nine in there too?

21:06.465 --> 21:10.303
(slams hand on table)
Damn it, Dawn! This is serious.

21:10.336 --> 21:13.605
Why? Why should I care
about any of this?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.342
Because
they'll take you away.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.217
Take me away?

21:26.553 --> 21:28.621
What do you mean?

21:28.654 --> 21:33.159
They'll take you
away from me.

21:33.192 --> 21:37.364
That's what your principal
told me when you weren't
in the room.

21:37.396 --> 21:40.833
If I can't make you
go to school,

21:40.866 --> 21:44.671
then I won't be found fit
to be your legal guardian.

21:53.311 --> 21:56.383
Where would I go?

21:56.415 --> 21:58.651
I don't know.

21:58.684 --> 22:03.288
Dad maybe
or foster care at--

22:03.321 --> 22:05.156
I didn't really
want to ask.

22:10.195 --> 22:12.163
You could've
told me that.

22:15.166 --> 22:16.536
I just did.

22:24.911 --> 22:28.847
(dramatic music playing)

23:15.227 --> 23:17.128
Is this seat taken?

23:20.567 --> 23:23.134
Well, I hope this
isn't a return.

23:23.169 --> 23:26.238
Everyone wants petrified
hamsters, and they're
never happy with them.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.747
-You all right?
-Yeah.

23:34.780 --> 23:38.416
Ah, yes, 'cause your good mood
is both obvious and contagious.

23:38.451 --> 23:41.953
I had a fight with Tara.
It was awful.

23:41.988 --> 23:45.758
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Me too.

23:45.791 --> 23:47.794
You two don't quarrel much,
do you?

23:47.826 --> 23:51.763
Never... until today.

23:51.798 --> 23:55.433
-Ah, well, it's over.
-Over?

23:55.468 --> 23:57.936
How can it be over?
I-- I just found her.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.772
The quarrel is over.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.842
Oh.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.810
Yeah.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.779
And you'll feel better when
you've made your apologies

24:07.814 --> 24:10.682
and you'll know that you can
fight without the world ending.

24:10.717 --> 24:14.621
I know it all seems bleak now,
but, as they say,

24:14.653 --> 24:17.455
this too... shall pass.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.695
Wow!

24:23.730 --> 24:25.832
Now, what do
we have here?

24:25.865 --> 24:28.000
Oh, he's one of those things
that work for Glory.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.469
Yes, how helpful.

24:30.502 --> 24:32.971
I do, indeed,
work for the god.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.807
Let me go
if you do not wish
to incur her anger.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.977
She's not here.

24:38.009 --> 24:40.613
What a marvelous opportunity
for you and me to talk.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.015
I will not
betray Glorificus.

24:43.048 --> 24:46.152
I will never talk,
no matter what
heinous torture--

24:46.184 --> 24:49.521
Actually,
you're talking quite a lot,
just not about the right things.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.557
Tell us why you're here.

24:51.590 --> 24:53.526
No word
shall pass my lips

24:53.559 --> 24:55.728
that would bring peril
to Glorificus.

24:57.763 --> 25:01.133
Girls, get the twine
that's on the counter.
Let's tie him up.

25:01.166 --> 25:05.837
-(crackle)
-Aaah! Oh! Don't.
I'll tell you anything!

25:05.872 --> 25:08.406
Please, whatever you want!
Just-- I'll--

25:08.440 --> 25:10.542
Anything.

25:10.576 --> 25:13.345
-What happened?
-He changed his mind.

25:13.378 --> 25:16.414
I'm-- I'm supposed
to watch.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.852
We're watching
the Slayer's people

25:19.885 --> 25:21.386
while Glory fetches the key.

25:22.622 --> 25:25.356
-Glory knows who the key is?
-Oh, god.

25:25.391 --> 25:28.094
-We've gotta call Buffy.
-Too late. Too late.

25:28.126 --> 25:31.096
Glorificus will find the witch,
and there's nothing
you can do to stop her.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.199
Witch?
What do you mean?

25:33.231 --> 25:37.036
-Tara.
-She's the new one among you.
It wasn't hard to figure out.

25:37.068 --> 25:40.006
-The Glorious One
will have found her by now.
-Willow, wait! I'll go with--

25:40.038 --> 25:43.809
No! Call Buffy
and go look in Tara's room!
I'm gonna check the fair!

25:46.112 --> 25:48.914
Oh, this is nice.

25:48.948 --> 25:51.884
Just hangin' out.
Just us girls.

25:54.252 --> 25:57.556
-You like this sort of thing,
don't you?
-(cracking)

25:57.589 --> 26:00.125
-Aaa-- (whimpers)
-Don't... make a sound.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.396
Nah, they won't help you.
I'd kill them.

26:05.431 --> 26:07.398
You know that.

26:07.432 --> 26:10.536
(police radio chatter)

26:10.568 --> 26:13.972
There's no one here
that can stop me.

26:14.006 --> 26:18.509
I'll kill her and--
and them.

26:19.746 --> 26:23.481
I'll kill him
and her and her,

26:23.515 --> 26:24.916
and it'll
all be your fault.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.554
It's kind of funny,
isn't it?

26:28.586 --> 26:31.123
All these people here
and...

26:31.156 --> 26:33.558
no one
who can do a thing.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.927
Not a person
who can help you.

26:37.496 --> 26:39.565
But that's people
for ya.

26:39.597 --> 26:42.034
They're
pretty worthless.

26:43.802 --> 26:47.173
But keys,
on the other hand...

26:47.205 --> 26:49.675
keys are worth a very lot.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.919
You lying little tramp.
You're not the key!

26:59.951 --> 27:02.922
You're nothing! Just another
worthless human being!

27:02.954 --> 27:06.826
-I didn't--
-I hate being lied to.

27:06.858 --> 27:09.028
It makes me feel
so betrayed.

27:11.563 --> 27:13.132
Hey!

27:14.200 --> 27:16.803
You wanna make it
all better?

27:16.836 --> 27:20.306
If you tell me
who the key really is,

27:20.338 --> 27:22.441
I'll let you go.

27:22.473 --> 27:24.476
-(bones crack)
-Think about it.

27:24.509 --> 27:26.679
-(whimpers)
-You think
your hand hurts?

27:26.712 --> 27:29.181
Imagine what you'd
feel with my fingers...

27:29.214 --> 27:32.785
wiggling
in your brain.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.987
It doesn't kill you.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.556
What it does...

27:37.588 --> 27:42.294
is make you feel like you're
in a noisy, little dark room,

27:42.327 --> 27:45.631
naked and ashamed,

27:45.663 --> 27:48.734
and there are things in the dark
that need to hurt you
because you're bad.

27:50.201 --> 27:53.538
Little pinching things
that go in your ears

27:53.572 --> 27:56.875
and crawl on the inside
of your skull.

27:56.909 --> 28:01.547
And you know, if the noise
and the crawling would stop,

28:01.579 --> 28:04.682
that you could remember
how to get out.

28:10.221 --> 28:14.059
But you never, ever will.

28:14.093 --> 28:17.829
-(bones crack)
-(gasps, whimpers)

28:17.864 --> 28:21.067
Who is the key?

28:28.207 --> 28:31.376
Fine. Let's get crazy.

28:38.450 --> 28:41.953
Tara! Tara!

28:41.988 --> 28:44.757
By the force of heart
and mindful power,

28:44.790 --> 28:47.926
by waning time
and waxing hour,

28:47.960 --> 28:50.395
I, um-- When I decree--

28:50.429 --> 28:52.798
Uh, what is it?
What is it?

28:52.832 --> 28:56.134
(gasps)
No! Nooo!

28:56.167 --> 28:58.703
That-- That she I love
must now be free!

28:58.737 --> 29:00.906
(Glory yelling)

29:02.508 --> 29:03.942
Tara!

29:05.510 --> 29:07.846
No! Tara!

29:09.280 --> 29:10.715
Tara, are you okay?

29:10.749 --> 29:14.586
It's dirty.
It's all dirty.

29:14.619 --> 29:18.490
And all over me.
Dirty. Dirty.

29:18.523 --> 29:21.593
Oh, bad. Bad.

29:21.626 --> 29:23.229
(whimpers)

29:23.261 --> 29:27.066
Tara.
Tara, I'm so sorry.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.268
I'm so sorry.
(sobs)

29:42.780 --> 29:45.183
Can't she
go home now?

29:45.217 --> 29:49.288
Unfortunately, no.
Hospital policy dictates
we keep her for the night.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.923
But does she have to?
I can take care of her
at home.

29:51.958 --> 29:54.926
It's poisoned.
Why didn't I tell you that?

29:54.961 --> 29:56.996
It-- It has to be
checked, though.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.000
She your sister?

30:01.032 --> 30:04.369
It has to be verified,
of course. Anyone can
tell you that.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.637
Of course, of course,
of course.

30:06.672 --> 30:09.474
She's my everything.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.278
Well, you can get her
released first thing
in the morning.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.279
But she's got
to spend one night
in the psych ward.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.548
Just for observation.

30:16.582 --> 30:20.019
We'll keep an eye on her,
do a couple of basic tests,
then you take her home.

30:20.051 --> 30:22.788
Does that sound fair?

30:22.820 --> 30:25.892
Well, you sit tight then,
and I'll send a nurse by
in a few minutes

30:25.924 --> 30:27.159
to pick up Tara.

30:32.397 --> 30:35.834
(door opens, closes)

30:35.867 --> 30:39.005
Man, words cannot express
how much I hate this place.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.339
It's dreadful.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.174
It's like communism.

30:44.410 --> 30:47.947
Hey.
Wil, I'm so sorry.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.423
They kill mice.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.294
Tara.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.172
I'm sorry it
took me so long.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.707
But Dawn's safe
with Spike, so I--

31:15.740 --> 31:17.576
I can stay as long
as you need.

31:18.809 --> 31:22.013
I'm so scared.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.750
Nothin' to be worried about,
kid. No one's gonna hurt you.

31:25.917 --> 31:27.920
Oh, yeah?

31:27.953 --> 31:29.955
The same no one
who did that to you?

31:29.989 --> 31:33.058
(huffs) What, these?
It's just a few bruises.

31:33.092 --> 31:35.094
Nothing to
write home about.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.964
Hey, chin up, platelet.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.967
Don't get scared.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.534
Maybe Glory doesn't
want to kill you.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.670
-Maybe it's something---
-Worse?

32:14.700 --> 32:17.803
-Hey.
-You want to know
what I'm scared of, Spike?

32:20.038 --> 32:21.973
Me.

32:24.476 --> 32:28.946
Right now,
Glory thinks Tara's the key.

32:30.382 --> 32:33.618
But I'm the key, Spike.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.554
I am.

32:36.822 --> 32:40.826
And anything
that happens to Tara...

32:40.858 --> 32:42.127
is 'cause of me.

32:43.061 --> 32:47.465
Your bruises, your limp...

32:47.499 --> 32:50.435
that's all me too.

32:50.469 --> 32:55.673
I'm like a lightning rod
for pain and hurt,

32:55.707 --> 32:58.644
and everyone
around me suffers

32:58.676 --> 33:00.878
and dies.

33:02.213 --> 33:06.317
I must be something
so horrible...

33:08.420 --> 33:12.691
to cause so much pain...
and evil.

33:12.723 --> 33:14.893
Rot.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.231
What do you know?

33:20.266 --> 33:22.468
I'm a vampire.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.171
I know something
about evil.

33:25.270 --> 33:28.473
You're not evil.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.942
Maybe I'm not evil.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.683
But I don't think
I can be good.

33:43.255 --> 33:47.925
Well, I'm not good,
and I'm okay.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.996
Don't! Please don't
with that treachery.

33:51.028 --> 33:53.898
(huffs)
I told the cats

33:53.932 --> 33:56.402
and now I beg my mother,
sitting all alone.

33:56.434 --> 33:59.137
Bye, Tara.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I love you.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.875
Willow, no.
It's just for one night.

34:04.910 --> 34:08.447
Yeah, I know,
but it's a whole night.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.717
I don't think
I can sleep without her.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.652
You can sleep
with me.

34:17.588 --> 34:20.492
Well, now, that came out
a lot more lesbian
than it sounded in my head.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.530
Wil, you just have to rest.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.398
Okay? Right now
there's nothing you can do.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.304
-Yes, there is.
-No.

34:32.338 --> 34:35.606
No way.
You cannot even think
about taking on Glory.

34:35.641 --> 34:38.443
You saw what she did to Tara.
I can't let her
get away with it.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.445
No, you have to let her
get away with it.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.648
Even I'm no match for her.
You know that.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.384
-But maybe I am.
-You're not.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.554
-And I won't let you go.
-This is not your choice.
It's mine.

34:48.585 --> 34:50.989
This is not the time.

34:51.021 --> 34:53.324
When, Buffy?
When is?

34:53.358 --> 34:58.096
When you feel like it?
When it's someone you love
as much as I love Tara?

34:58.130 --> 35:00.231
When it's Dawn,
is that it?

35:00.266 --> 35:03.001
When we have a chance.

35:03.034 --> 35:06.505
We'll fight her
when we have a chance.

35:06.538 --> 35:09.641
You wouldn't last
five minutes with her,
Willow.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.443
She's a god.

35:14.313 --> 35:17.282
Fine. I'll wait.

35:17.315 --> 35:20.485
It's the only way.

35:20.518 --> 35:21.820
Yeah.

35:24.121 --> 35:27.659
-Can I do anything?
-Just let me be alone.

36:19.445 --> 36:23.215
You know, I think
I'm a little buzzed
from eating that witch!

36:23.248 --> 36:25.351
What a mind she had.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.152
Mmm, nummy treat.

36:27.184 --> 36:29.588
But is Your Grace
not the slightest bit
concerned about--

36:29.621 --> 36:33.090
What, about the Slayer?
Don't be stupid.

36:33.123 --> 36:35.927
I know I'm closing in.
The key's as good as mine.

36:35.960 --> 36:39.164
Girl like Buffy's got
just so many friends.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.900
All I gotta do
is rip through 'em
one by one...

36:41.932 --> 36:43.235
until I finally--

36:43.268 --> 36:45.103
(loud rumbling)

36:55.045 --> 36:56.447
Did anybody order
an apocalypse?

37:00.786 --> 37:04.623
Kali, Hera, Kronos, Tonic...

37:04.655 --> 37:07.626
air like nectar,
thick as onyx...

37:07.659 --> 37:09.628
Cassiel
by your second star--

37:09.661 --> 37:12.931
Oh, it's the lover.
That's so cute.

37:12.963 --> 37:15.601
Hold mine victim,
as in tar.

37:18.068 --> 37:20.905
I owe you pain!

37:20.938 --> 37:25.411
(screaming)

37:26.911 --> 37:29.748
-It's all
my fault.
-No.

37:29.780 --> 37:32.250
Sweetheart,
it is not your fault.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.789
How's Willow?

37:38.824 --> 37:43.561
She was looking to go
all paybacky on Glory
for a minute,

37:43.594 --> 37:45.764
but I cooled her
down a little.

37:45.797 --> 37:48.666
Actually, a lot.

37:48.699 --> 37:51.436
So, she's not gonna
do anything rash then?

37:51.469 --> 37:53.605
No.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.974
I explained
there was no point.

37:56.007 --> 37:59.177
(skeptical)
Mm-hmm.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.512
What?

38:04.048 --> 38:06.617
You--
So you're saying that a...

38:06.652 --> 38:10.021
powerful and mightily
pissed-off witch

38:10.054 --> 38:12.923
was plannin' on
goin' and spillin' herself
a few pints of god blood

38:12.958 --> 38:16.394
until you, what,
explained?

38:18.295 --> 38:20.931
You think she-- No.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.668
I told Willow it would
be like suicide.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.336
I'd do it.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.376
Right person.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.177
Person I loved.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.313
I'd do it.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.719
Think, Buffy,

38:40.751 --> 38:43.855
If Glory had
done that to me.

38:45.523 --> 38:46.391
Shatter!

38:51.195 --> 38:53.498
Is that it?
Is that the best you can do?

38:53.532 --> 38:56.601
You think
I care about all this--
the apartment, the clothes?

39:00.070 --> 39:02.340
Now, sucking on
your girlfriend's mind?

39:03.708 --> 39:05.710
That was something
to treasure.

39:12.717 --> 39:15.286
What's this?
Bag of tricks?

39:16.422 --> 39:17.956
Bag of knives.

39:20.726 --> 39:23.360
Spirit of serpents
now appear.

39:25.896 --> 39:29.233
Hissing, writhing,
striking near.

39:36.608 --> 39:37.943
Now this is getting weak.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.449
And so are you, honey.
Aren't ya?

39:49.788 --> 39:51.222
No!

39:53.057 --> 39:56.728
You know what they used
to do to witches, lover?
Crucify 'em.

39:58.929 --> 40:01.099
-They used to bow down to gods.
-Ha.

40:01.132 --> 40:02.266
(grunts)

40:05.570 --> 40:06.672
Things change!

40:19.451 --> 40:21.487
That witch
really slowed me down.

40:29.494 --> 40:30.929
Thicken.

40:32.297 --> 40:35.132
This isn't over,
you hear me?
It isn't over!

40:48.012 --> 40:49.847
-Chicken salad?
-Right here.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.451
Eggplant,
that's me.

40:53.485 --> 40:57.255
Salami with--
Eww! Peanut butter?

40:57.288 --> 41:00.791
-Dawn.
-Yeah, like eggplant
is normal.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.360
It's what,
half egg, half plant?

41:03.393 --> 41:05.630
'Cause that's
just unnatural.

41:05.664 --> 41:08.132
What's Tara got?

41:08.166 --> 41:11.469
Oh, I got her tuna.
Does she like--

41:14.639 --> 41:15.806
DAWN:
Tara?

41:25.483 --> 41:27.652
Plastic and their sick sisters.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.188
Six sick sisters.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.824
-Willow?
-It's okay.

41:33.858 --> 41:36.360
Let's just start slow today.

41:36.393 --> 41:38.530
Buffy, could I have that?

41:42.768 --> 41:44.603
Here you go.

41:49.775 --> 41:51.909
That's my girl.

41:55.213 --> 41:56.681
Can I help?

42:08.092 --> 42:12.396
-What are you gonna need?
-I don't know.

42:12.429 --> 42:15.733
They gave me a lot of stuff
to keep her calm.

42:20.639 --> 42:23.541
They said I might have
to restrain her at night,

42:23.574 --> 42:27.445
but...
sometimes she's fine.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.081
She looks at me and...

42:30.114 --> 42:31.750
she's fine.

42:35.887 --> 42:41.626
-I'm sorry. I couldn't--
-It's okay. I can do this.

42:41.659 --> 42:45.295
I'm gonna take care of her,
even if she never--

42:48.099 --> 42:49.835
She's my girl.

42:56.842 --> 42:58.009
I understand.

43:01.478 --> 43:03.347
I know you do.

43:08.286 --> 43:09.688
Hear that, baby?

43:11.623 --> 43:13.291
You're my always.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.168
I told you this wasn't over.

43:24.202 --> 43:26.570
No! The place is cracking.
It's cracking!

43:26.603 --> 43:28.806
Cracking!
No, no!

43:28.840 --> 43:31.643
-No, Tara, it's okay.
-Oh, look at that.

43:31.677 --> 43:34.411
Look at that.
Oh, the light.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.847
Oh, it's so pure.

43:36.882 --> 43:39.117
Such pure,
green energy.

43:39.150 --> 43:41.987
-(gasps)
-Oh, it's so beautiful.

43:54.498 --> 43:55.733
(theme music playing)

44:24.494 --> 44:26.431
Grr! Arrgh!
