11:15.250 --> 11:18.917
- All right, well, query away.

11:18.917 --> 11:22.667
- [grunts]
I really love your daughter...

11:22.667 --> 11:23.875
- Uh-huh?
- And, uh, can you pass me

11:23.875 --> 11:25.917
that pipe wrench right there,
the red one?

11:25.917 --> 11:27.125
The red one?
Yep, that one.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.709
- Got it.
- Okay.

11:29.709 --> 11:33.208
And--ooh--

11:33.208 --> 11:38.709
my life has been changed
ever since I met her.

11:38.709 --> 11:41.375
And I was just wondering...

11:41.375 --> 11:42.834
[metal squeaks]

11:42.834 --> 11:47.166
If I could get your blessing
to marry her.

11:47.166 --> 11:51.000
- Oh.
Don't you mean my permission?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.709
- I sort of already asked her.

11:55.709 --> 11:59.083
[chuckles] And I'm a lucky man.

11:59.083 --> 12:02.375
And--and I promise to spend
the rest of my life

12:02.375 --> 12:05.000
making sure Alyssa's happy.

12:06.291 --> 12:09.250

12:09.250 --> 12:12.250
but welcome to the family, son?

12:12.250 --> 12:15.166
- Yeah?
[laughter]

12:15.166 --> 12:17.125
- Tucker, seriously,

12:17.125 --> 12:20.125
you've got to stop doing
these things in the bathroom.

12:20.125 --> 12:26.750
- Dinner is... Oh...
darling... are you...

12:26.750 --> 12:27.875
- Yeah.

12:27.875 --> 12:31.417
- Tucker,
oh, that's wonderful.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.917
- Well...
- Yep.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.333
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.917
- Oh.
- Oh, my goodness.

12:36.917 --> 12:37.917
- Look.

12:37.917 --> 12:39.417
[light upbeat music]

12:39.417 --> 12:42.250
- Congratulations!

12:42.250 --> 12:44.375
[gasps] It is beautiful.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.834
- Thank you.

12:45.834 --> 12:49.041
It belonged to Tucker's
great-great grandmother.

12:49.041 --> 12:53.250
- I can't believe
Tucker finally proposed.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.125
- In a bathroom.
- You can always count on...

12:55.125 --> 12:58.250
Tucker to be spontaneous
and memorable.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.792
- That's so true.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.500
Will you be
my matron of honor?

13:02.500 --> 13:05.959
- [squeals] Absolutely!

13:05.959 --> 13:08.333
Just give me enough time
to lose the baby weight.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.959
- We're planning
a small engagement party

13:09.959 --> 13:11.125
with a few friends.

13:11.125 --> 13:13.083
I'm hoping you and Harrison
will make it.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.250
- We wouldn't miss it.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.041
- Good morning.

13:17.041 --> 13:18.834
- Oh, Ms. Dunville.

13:18.834 --> 13:21.375
I don't see you
on the schedule.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.959
- Is this an emergency?

13:22.959 --> 13:25.125
- No, no, no, no, no,
I had a hair appointment nearby.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.458
You had mentioned before
that your boyfriend

13:27.458 --> 13:29.166
is a top contractor?

13:29.166 --> 13:31.458
- Fiancé now.

13:31.458 --> 13:34.333
- Oh, look at that.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.125
Gosh, congratulations.

13:36.125 --> 13:40.000
- Thank you, and yes, Tucker
runs Brennan Construction.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.417
- I'm remodeling,
and I need a good contractor.

13:42.417 --> 13:44.375

to give you their number.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.542
- I appreciate it.

skip the big wedding.

the wedding of her dreams.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.250
- Well, everything
looks fantastic.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.333
- Great.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.375
- Do you two have
any other questions?

14:09.375 --> 14:12.208
- Is it normal
that I'm hungry all the time?

14:12.208 --> 14:15.208
- Yes, though, you generally
don't want to gain more

14:15.208 --> 14:18.333
than a pound a week
after your first trimester.

14:18.333 --> 14:21.041
So I see you've elected
to not hear the gender.

14:21.041 --> 14:22.375
Is that still the case?

14:22.375 --> 14:24.333
- Yes.
- No.

14:25.542 --> 14:27.250
No, don't tell us.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.625
We want to be surprised.

14:29.625 --> 14:32.375
- Okay, well, if you have
any other questions or issues,

14:32.375 --> 14:33.625
just give me a call anytime.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.125
- Okay.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.208
- Actually, I do have
one more quick question.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.250
Honey, can you grab the car?

14:39.250 --> 14:42.041
- I am on it. All right.

14:42.041 --> 14:45.125
- What can I help you with?

14:45.125 --> 14:48.458
- Yeah, can you tell me
if we're having a boy or a...

14:48.458 --> 14:52.291
- Babe, you have the keys.
- Oh, right.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.542
- So you--

14:53.542 --> 14:56.375
- Uh, fatigue is normal
at eight months.

14:56.375 --> 14:57.959
That's good to know.

Thanks, Doc.
- No problem.

Thanks again.

- Thank you.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.625
- Where is my grandson?

15:13.625 --> 15:14.625
- Typical Tucker.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.667
- I'm sure he'll be on his way.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.417
- Perhaps I should revoke
my permission for him

15:18.417 --> 15:19.667
to marry my daughter.

15:19.667 --> 15:23.250

15:23.250 --> 15:25.500
- Where are you? Call me.

15:26.542 --> 15:28.083
- Everything okay?

15:28.083 --> 15:30.250
- Oh, Tucker was supposed
to be here two hours ago

15:30.250 --> 15:33.250
with the food and drink, and
he's not answering his phone.

15:33.250 --> 15:35.083
- I can get Harrison
to go to the store.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.583
He can get you
whatever you need.

15:36.583 --> 15:40.375

miss his own engagement party.

15:40.375 --> 15:42.417
- Hey.

15:42.417 --> 15:43.625
- No, it's...

15:46.125 --> 15:49.125
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.083
- Okay, so check this out, Ox.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.333
I'm thinking of repurposing
some of the material from the

15:55.333 --> 15:58.959

a whole wall of reclaimed wood.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.625

the idea.

16:00.625 --> 16:02.333
- Wow, that's beautiful.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.333
And that's a combination
of rustic and elegant.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.500
Good job.
- Thanks, Ox.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.125
I think my dad's really gonna
like it too.

16:08.125 --> 16:09.625
I should tell him
right away, huh?

16:09.625 --> 16:11.333

- Your engagement party?

16:13.250 --> 16:16.041
- That's not tonight.
- Yeah, that's what he said.

16:18.458 --> 16:19.625
- Oh, no!

16:19.625 --> 16:21.417
Alyssa's gonna kill me.

16:21.417 --> 16:25.250
- Well, you better run.
- Oh, come on.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.166
Hello, hello.

It's just me
and your Grandma Gigi.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.125
- Oh. Where's Alyssa?

16:48.125 --> 16:51.458
- She's in the bathroom
with Courtney.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.208
You might want to put on
some body armor

16:53.208 --> 16:54.667
before you go back there,
though.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.166

17:00.166 --> 17:01.250
- Not smart.
- Yeah?

17:01.250 --> 17:02.333
- Don't do it.
- Not good?

17:02.333 --> 17:05.416
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.

17:10.709 --> 17:13.709
- I can't believe he'd mess up
something this important.

17:13.709 --> 17:17.125
- I'm sorry, honey.

17:17.125 --> 17:18.290
- I know he loves me.

17:18.290 --> 17:21.040
- Of course he does.

I wish...

on our vision for our--
our nuptials.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.959
- Oh, of course.

20:33.959 --> 20:37.542
As you know,
I want to remodel my kitchen.

20:37.542 --> 20:43.625
I like to cook, and I would like
a bigger pantry over there,

20:43.625 --> 20:47.625
and I would like to add
a breakfast nook over there.

20:47.625 --> 20:48.917
- We can do that.

20:48.917 --> 20:51.250
- What do you think
that's gonna cost me?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.583
- Well, I would say it would
take approximately eight to ten

20:53.583 --> 20:56.750
weeks, and depending
on the material you choose,

20:56.750 --> 20:58.583
this would be
a baseline rough estimate.

20:58.583 --> 20:59.750
I haven't taken
any measurements,

20:59.750 --> 21:01.917
but that's ballpark.

21:01.917 --> 21:05.750

Brothers gave me a much lower

21:05.750 --> 21:08.792
quote and promised they could
get it done in six weeks.

21:08.792 --> 21:11.375
- With all due respect, the
Staferton Brothers use the same

21:11.375 --> 21:15.291
tacky cookie-cutter design
on every job.

21:15.291 --> 21:17.875
- So what did you think
of the design I faxed over?

21:17.875 --> 21:19.500
- It's all right,
but we can do better.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.333
For instance, if you
opened up this wall, you'd have

21:21.333 --> 21:22.792
a large connected space
for the dining room.

21:22.792 --> 21:23.959
- Interesting.

21:23.959 --> 21:25.542
- And that would help
with the flow.

21:25.542 --> 21:27.291
Your guests would no longer
clog up your kitchen.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.959
- Because everybody does
congregate in the kitchen,

21:29.959 --> 21:32.291
and how am I supposed to
entertain properly when everyone

21:32.291 --> 21:34.583
is stuffed in here
like sardines in a tin can?

21:34.583 --> 21:35.917
- Exactly.

21:35.917 --> 21:38.625
- [sighs] I assume this is
going to cost me a lot more.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.458
- Well, again, it depends
on the material you choose,

21:40.458 --> 21:41.625
but no, not really.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.875
It shouldn't be
that much more.
