No, of course not. That's stupid.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.831

19:48.312 --> 19:50.606
Not yet. I can do that.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.692
I mean, <i>not</i> do that.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.234
Okay. Okay.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.945
Do you even<i> want</i> to be a college professor?

19:55.987 --> 19:57.237
I don't know, to be honest.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.865
I hadn't really thought about it.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.616
I mean, 'cause I don't want to push you into anything.

20:00.658 --> 20:01.993
Pbht.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.410
What's that supposed to mean?

20:03.452 --> 20:05.538
Pbht? Oh, it's just...

20:09.667 --> 20:12.419
Carmen and Dave. Yeah.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.421
Apparently, they want to go on a double date

20:14.463 --> 20:15.965
with me, you, and Izzy.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.051
Seems like they're making an effort

20:18.092 --> 20:19.886
<i>not</i> to find us self-destructive and moronic.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.637
I mean, that --

20:19.927 --> 20:21.637
that's something.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.056
Yeah, here's to something.

20:23.097 --> 20:25.391
Here's to something.

20:25.432 --> 20:28.310
Apparently, I have an interview at Griffin tomorrow.

20:29.687 --> 20:30.980
Hey.

20:31.022 --> 20:32.565
I mean, how bad can that be, right?

20:32.606 --> 20:34.650
It's not like you're working the late-night drive-through

20:34.692 --> 20:36.402
at Taco Bell or anything.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.402
Mm-hmm.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.154
I mean, if -- if you want to,

20:38.196 --> 20:39.864
'cause, you know, I don't want to push you into anything.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.115
No. No.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.658
Please don't. I would not.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.243
I'll just push you in this doorway right here.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.499
Oh, it's Emma.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.127
Just take it.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.088
I'd hate for you to get in trouble with the wifey.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.631
Hi, monkey.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.176
Andrew: Hello.

21:00.218 --> 21:02.428
Oh. Oh, hey.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.804
'Sup?

21:03.846 --> 21:08.601
Izzy: No, it's just, uh...

21:08.642 --> 21:11.478
It's surprising.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.355
Stop that immediately.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.191
Where do they want to go?

21:15.233 --> 21:18.861
No, that's -- I'm in.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.822
Nope, it's all good. Bye.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.616
Andrew.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.409
Isabelle. Okay,

21:23.657 --> 21:25.409
this is still weird.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.327
Well, doesn't help when you braid tongues in front of me.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.371
I got to skedaddle anyway.

21:29.413 --> 21:32.083
Emma and Jack are picking me up.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.417
Aww. Aww.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.670
For a double date with Carmen and Dave.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.172
Oh.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.507
Amaris have chosen the venue -- China Girl.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.884
China Girl?

21:41.926 --> 21:43.385
Oh, my God, they did that for you.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.429
They want you to think that they're, you know, cool.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.680
It's pretty cute.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.891
Yeah. Okay, wait.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.560
You have to promise me that you're gonna get video

21:48.933 --> 21:51.560
of the 30-somethings dancing.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.524
You're a horrible person, but of course I will.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.277
Bye, Boo.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.691
You chose this place?

22:38.732 --> 22:40.567
Not me, this one.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.987
I Googled "coolest Portland dance club."

22:43.029 --> 22:45.447
You sure you didn't accidently type in

22:45.489 --> 22:48.534
"greatest concentration of assholes in one place"?

22:48.575 --> 22:51.411
I might quit my job and start my own firm.

22:51.453 --> 22:54.123
That's fucking awesome. I know.

22:51.453 --> 22:54.123
Can you believe it?

22:54.165 --> 22:55.833
Yeah. Is it raining

22:54.165 --> 22:55.833
in here?

22:55.875 --> 22:57.584
I keep feeling these drops of --

22:57.626 --> 22:59.337
I think it's sweat, babe.

22:59.377 --> 23:00.587
Oh, God.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.507
Em, I just took a giant shit in my pants.

23:03.549 --> 23:06.219
I know, right? This place is amazing!

23:06.260 --> 23:08.012
We can say anything.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.348
Okay, guys, dance time.

23:10.388 --> 23:12.350
Dave? Dave: Oh.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.851
Uh, I'm okay.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.602
I-I'm just gonna do like a little shoulder thing

23:15.644 --> 23:17.021
here in the dark if that's okay.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.438
Emma, don't do it.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.857
Remember last time?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.984
Yeah, but I'm so much drunker this time.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.569
Stranger sweat in my eye.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.821
Honey -- Stranger sweat

23:23.610 --> 23:25.821

23:25.863 --> 23:27.948
Okay, okay. All right, don't -- careful.

I don't know.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.437
I have a vague recollection, but I can't tell

24:39.477 --> 24:41.397
if it was a fever dream or a horror movie we saw.

how to ride really fast.

Hold on.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.701
Are you saying y

24:54.743 --> 24:57.163
You think she's just, like, gay?

24:57.204 --> 24:59.123
I don't know what I think, Carmen, okay?

24:59.165 --> 25:00.707
It's a lot for me to process,

25:00.749 --> 25:03.043
a lot of new information coming at me about my wife.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.544
It feels like just yesterday,

25:04.586 --> 25:06.630
I found out she even kissed a girl.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.883
Pretty much<i> was</i> yesterday.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.434
Uh... Well, look at that.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.434
Yeah, I had no idea.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.718
