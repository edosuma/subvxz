(Jay)
Mysterious snake samurai.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.243
Things attack Ninjago.

00:09.277 --> 00:10.544
Cyrus Borg is missing

00:10.578 --> 00:12.146
and our team is down
one master

00:12.180 --> 00:13.447
and one ninja.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.548
Dr. Saunders.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.384
You are Krux.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.787
- Your parents were traitors!
- No!

00:19.820 --> 00:23.124

Episode 68, "Scavengers."

00:52.853 --> 00:55.289
Oh, Misako.

00:55.323 --> 00:58.159
All the time
we have known each other..

00:58.192 --> 01:00.128
Someone wise once said

01:00.161 --> 01:02.496
"We do not go forward
by looking back."

01:02.530 --> 01:05.499
- When did I say that?
- Never.

01:05.533 --> 01:06.567
I did.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.136
[chuckling]

01:08.169 --> 01:09.470
[screaming]

01:10.438 --> 01:12.606
[dramatic music]

01:13.407 --> 01:15.676
[growling]

01:20.214 --> 01:22.650
Stay by my side, Misako.

01:22.683 --> 01:23.684
Misako?

01:23.717 --> 01:26.354
[cackling]

01:31.359 --> 01:32.860
Misako.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.229
- At my side.
- Of course.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.298
As I always will be.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.467
And as you always
will be for me.

01:41.535 --> 01:42.570
What is it, Wu?

01:42.603 --> 01:45.239
I haven't told anyone.

01:45.273 --> 01:48.209
But when I fought Acronix
at the monastery

01:48.242 --> 01:50.444
something happened..

01:51.579 --> 01:53.147
...something bad.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.583
Oh, this is bad.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.186
I told everyone to go back
to the Airjitzu temple

01:58.219 --> 01:59.720
while I got you back online.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.722
'And still nothing.'

02:01.755 --> 02:05.559
All I got left is trying
a total system reboot.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.694
[electric buzzing]

02:09.797 --> 02:12.300
Oh. Eh-eh-ha-ha. Ha-ha.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.437
- Nya.
- Oh.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.507
- I'm so glad you're--
- That potato was a flange.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.642
Forty-one, eight, two, three.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.244
A narwol horn is to red

02:23.277 --> 02:24.845
as weather is
greater than pudding.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.215
Fifty seat auto-doc feeder.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.617
Okay, Zane, take it easy.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.484
That's it.

02:30.518 --> 02:34.255
- Banana curtain nine.
- Oh, come on.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.257
I've tried everything.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.791
What is going on in there?

02:37.825 --> 02:40.794
What is going on
is I'm trying to unscramble

02:40.828 --> 02:44.498
Zane's neural pathway
so we can go rescue Cyrus Borg.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.767
And you haven't
tried everything.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.670
You need to realign
Zane's neural inputs.

02:49.703 --> 02:50.938
Can you hear me?

02:50.971 --> 02:52.373
- Hello?
- Hello?

02:52.406 --> 02:57.345
- Hotdog rainy day in seven.
- Okay..

02:57.378 --> 02:59.347
Maybe what you need is..

02:59.380 --> 03:00.948
Don't say a new
binary power core.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.284
A new binary power core!

03:03.317 --> 03:05.886
- I'll be right back!
- Wait! No, don't leave.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.956
Plate, show, clipboard!

03:08.989 --> 03:11.392
And at the monastery,
Acronix hit me

03:11.425 --> 03:14.728
with what he called
the Time Punch.

03:14.762 --> 03:17.398
Now, I'm rapidly ageing.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.967
I would estimate
one day every hour.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.336
The effect is accelerating.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.872
And will continue
to do so until..

03:24.905 --> 03:27.441
- 'Master Wu.'
- Say nothing.

03:27.475 --> 03:30.244
The Ninja must not be distracted
at this crucial time.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.480
They might be able to help you.

03:32.513 --> 03:36.284
- 'May I enter?'
- My fate is inevitable, Misako.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.952
Like the sun rising in the east.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.854
Like fall turning into winter.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.456
- Wu.
- Master Wu.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.425
You must keep my secret.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.761
- Ah.
- How is he?

03:47.795 --> 03:49.463
[snoring]

03:49.497 --> 03:50.931
Still recovering.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.634
There's so little time.
So many lessons.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.371
Fight with your back to the sun.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.773
Eight cups of water a day
is a myth.

03:59.807 --> 04:04.545
You should've been there when I
fought Acronix but I, I..

04:06.046 --> 04:10.284
Why, he's right.
I should've been at his side.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.686
I failed my master.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.489
I will not make
that mistake again.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.858
[grunting]

04:20.928 --> 04:21.929
Zane is down.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.297
[grunting]

04:23.331 --> 04:24.965
Folks disappearing all over town

04:24.998 --> 04:27.067
and we can't do a thing to help.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.504
If we just knew why Acronix
and Krux are taking people..

04:30.538 --> 04:31.772
You know my theory?

04:31.805 --> 04:34.442
For the last time,
they are not hostages.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.943
How can you be sure?

04:35.976 --> 04:38.011
No ransom note.

04:38.045 --> 04:41.615
Maybe they're gonna hypnotize
them into being an army.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.051
Krux and Acronix
already have an army.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.886
Of samurai snakes!

04:45.919 --> 04:47.321
[grunting]

04:47.355 --> 04:49.357
Well, you know,
my other theory is..

04:49.390 --> 04:52.059
Do not say
alien abductions again.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.727
Or dimensional rifts.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.062
[grunting]

04:55.095 --> 04:57.064
Or Elvin magic portals!

04:57.097 --> 04:58.932
[grunting]

04:58.966 --> 05:00.468
[screaming]

05:03.671 --> 05:05.473
[groaning]

05:05.506 --> 05:08.676
Sorry, it's just
I'm tired of speculating.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.978
We need to take action.
Right, Kai?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.980
[grunting]

05:13.013 --> 05:15.516
Kai, you okay?

05:15.549 --> 05:16.884
You've haven't been
the same since you

05:16.917 --> 05:18.519
squared off against Krux.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.120
Did-did he do something?

05:20.153 --> 05:21.755
More like said something.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.123
[grunts]

05:23.156 --> 05:26.560
- No. Nothing. I'm fine.
- Well, good.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.062
'Cause I was just sayin'
it's time to stop guessing

05:29.096 --> 05:30.698
and to start fighting.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.100
So, you're suggesting we capture
one of those snake guys

05:33.133 --> 05:34.802
and bring them back here
for Wu to question?

05:34.835 --> 05:38.406
I just wanna fight somebody
but, okay, we can do that too.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.708
- That plan won't work.
- Why not?

05:40.741 --> 05:42.710
Because Master Wu
still hasn't recovered

05:42.743 --> 05:44.445
from his battle with Acronix.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.648
He rambles. He passes out.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.817
I think he's a lot more hurt
than he lets on.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.721
Oh, great. All this and now
we have no leader either?

05:53.754 --> 05:56.924
Uh, that's not exactly true.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.527
[clears throat]
With Wu out of commission

05:59.560 --> 06:03.096
the, um, logical successor
would be, uh..

06:03.130 --> 06:04.965
The Green Ninja.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.535
Mm, correct.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.737
Uh, Master Lloyd?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.839
Temporary Master Lloyd,
you mean.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.106
'In training.'

06:13.140 --> 06:14.475
Okay.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.977
Temporary Master Lloyd
in training.

06:17.010 --> 06:20.481
We mere ninja
await your words of wisdom.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.883
Which I assume
involve kicking some butt

06:22.916 --> 06:25.018
till we get a few answers,
right?

06:25.052 --> 06:27.855
Ha-ha. Yeah! Ha-ha.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.725
Wrong. Too random.
We need a plan.

06:31.759 --> 06:32.760
We have one.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.161
- Go kick some butt.
- Really?

06:34.194 --> 06:36.163
Whose butt? Where?

06:36.196 --> 06:37.998
- We'll work it out down there.
- No.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.967
We'll work it out here first.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.769
That's what Wu would do.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.871
Come on.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.005
Oh, yeah!

06:45.038 --> 06:46.106
I just love sitting around

06:46.139 --> 06:47.908
and talking instead of doing.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.944
Cut him some slack, guys.
He's doing the best he can.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.525
Huh?

07:08.061 --> 07:09.530
Oh, come on.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.799
Jimmy, you ain't gonna believe..

07:12.833 --> 07:14.234
Jimmy?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.804
[indistinct chatter on phone]

07:17.838 --> 07:18.939
[beeping]

07:18.972 --> 07:20.207
Eh-hey!

07:20.240 --> 07:22.743
Just called to tell you that I'm
walking to the coffee shop now.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.613
Cool! I'll see you there.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.083
Hello? Hello?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.185
No bars. What's goin' on?

07:32.219 --> 07:35.088
Oh, uh. Ca-can you hear me now?

07:35.122 --> 07:37.658
Now? Uh?

07:37.691 --> 07:40.528
Huh? The cell tower's down!

07:40.561 --> 07:42.730
[screaming]

07:43.230 --> 07:46.166
Ah! My trophies.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.168
Why would someone steal them?

07:48.201 --> 07:52.239
Why? Wh-y-y?

07:52.272 --> 07:56.677
(Raggmunk)
'Yes. Soon we will have
all the metal we need.'

07:56.710 --> 08:00.280
Courtesy of
the Vermillion Warriors!

08:00.313 --> 08:03.216
[cackling]

08:03.250 --> 08:04.585
Really?

08:04.618 --> 08:07.655
- What?
- All the metal? Like that's it?

08:07.688 --> 08:10.057
- Finito?
- Yeah. Why?

08:10.090 --> 08:12.526
Nothing. Nothing. It's fine.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.729
Acronix and Krux
signed off on it?

08:15.763 --> 08:19.132
Oh, who cares.
Now, let me concentrate.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.703
Increase Operation Heavy Metal.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.839
- Really? That's the name you--
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.107
[humming]

08:27.140 --> 08:28.108
[screaming]

08:32.646 --> 08:35.248
Help! Someone stole my trophies!

08:35.282 --> 08:36.884
I have an alibi.

08:36.917 --> 08:40.187
Wait. Why would anyone
steal your fake trophies?

08:40.220 --> 08:42.590
Hey, no!
They were irreplaceable.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.725
Which is why I'm here
to buy replacements.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.627
You want
world championships this time

08:46.660 --> 08:48.028
or just inter-continental?

08:48.061 --> 08:50.230
Uh, uh, uh..

08:50.263 --> 08:52.700
- Let's mix and match.
- One sec.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.340
- Uh, oh.
- Uh..

09:00.373 --> 09:01.742
They're not with me.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.344
Fellas, we have a very strict

09:04.377 --> 09:06.346
store policy
against shoplifting.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.115
[dramatic music]

09:12.152 --> 09:14.788
(Dareth)
Hey! Those are my trophies!

09:16.089 --> 09:17.925
Give them back!

09:17.958 --> 09:19.026
[grunts]

09:19.927 --> 09:22.630
(Dareth)
Whoa. Whoa.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.365
Whoa-a-a!

09:25.398 --> 09:28.702
So, I-I think
we can safely rule out..

09:28.736 --> 09:31.805
...these places as hiding spots
for the missing people.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.173
These are too small.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.610
These are too public,
and these are too obvious.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.746
Or are they so obvious

09:38.779 --> 09:42.115
that they're actually
the perfect hiding spot?

09:42.149 --> 09:43.984
Hmm. Interesting.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.319
[slurping]

09:46.353 --> 09:48.355
- What are you doing?
- I'm bored.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.723
So, I'm messing with him.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.659
But now Lloyd's starting over.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.662
He's gonna take even longer.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.963
Sorry to interrupt
what looks to be

09:55.996 --> 09:57.831
the most boring party game ever

09:57.865 --> 09:59.833
but the city's
under attack down there.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.368
- Yes!
- Yes!

10:01.401 --> 10:03.671
Uh, uh, I mean that's horrible.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.005
- Terrible.
- The worst.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.007
There's a bunch of samurai
and snakes stealing

10:07.040 --> 10:08.842
every piece of metal
they can find.

10:08.876 --> 10:12.045
They took my trophies.
My trophies!

10:12.079 --> 10:15.182
- Any sign of Krux or Acronix?
- Who?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.751
- Doesn't matter. Let's go!
- Well, wait!

10:17.785 --> 10:19.419
This doesn't make sense.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.888
Why are they after metal?

10:20.921 --> 10:23.724
- We can ask as we pummel them.
- No!

10:23.757 --> 10:26.694
It might be a diversion
to draw us away from the temple

10:26.727 --> 10:28.261
so they can finish off
Master Wu.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.698
We can't just ignore
the damage they're doing.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.399
Nor that they have my trophies!

10:32.432 --> 10:35.669
I'm not leaving
Master Wu unprotected again.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.871
Well, we're going.

10:37.905 --> 10:42.776
- I'm ordering you to stay!
- And we're ignoring that order.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.078
- So?
- Just go.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.849
Nya will have my back.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.222
Okay. Zane, I..

10:55.255 --> 10:56.757
- Zane!
- Gah!

10:56.790 --> 10:59.727
There go my buddy.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.929
My buddy!

11:03.096 --> 11:05.065
Get off my friend!

11:05.733 --> 11:07.034
[grunting]

11:07.067 --> 11:10.103
Come on, Zane. Let's do this!

11:10.137 --> 11:12.439
Executive cucumber!

11:12.472 --> 11:13.874
[Zane grunting]

11:13.907 --> 11:16.844
Oh! Or maybe you should
sit this one out.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.813
Fiber zing taco.
Fiber zing taco.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.181
(P.I.X.A.L.)
'Brace yourself, Zane.'

11:21.214 --> 11:24.718
I'm re-routing all
existing power to your chest.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.220
In three, two, one.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.322
[whirring]

11:29.356 --> 11:32.492
Oh. Total electrical overload.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.061
Nice move, buddy.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.096
I knew you were
in there somewhere.

11:36.129 --> 11:40.067
Of course, now I
have to reboot you again, but..

11:40.100 --> 11:43.703
Oh!
They stole my Samurai X gear.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.974
I hate not having
tunes on the ride.

11:47.007 --> 11:50.778
But the USB port is the only way
to power you back up.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.713
Those snakes stole
from the wrong girl.

12:00.387 --> 12:05.092
Uh, all these tunnels under
the city look the same, huh?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.294
Pretty confusing I'll bet.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.162
It's a secret lair.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.231
It's supposed
to be hard to find.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.033
Yeah, but not for us.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.868
I'll figure it out in a second.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.270
Oh, get with the times, brother.

12:17.304 --> 12:21.008
My new Borg Watch
has built-in GPS.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.811
- The, uh..
- What's wrong?

12:23.844 --> 12:25.245
Uh, nothing.

12:25.278 --> 12:29.049
Just respecting your feelings
about tradition, and..

12:29.082 --> 12:32.820
No service. That's why
I don't get with the times.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.956
The old ways are still superior.
Follow me.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.163
[all grunting]

12:43.196 --> 12:46.766
I hope things are going
this well top side.

12:48.135 --> 12:51.438
Yes, Operation Heavy Metal's
so good

12:51.471 --> 12:53.941
the Ninja don't even know
what's up.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.376
Nothing will stop us!

12:56.409 --> 12:57.811
[tires screeching]

12:58.946 --> 13:00.080
Way to jinx it.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.515
Last one up is a rotten ninja!

13:02.549 --> 13:04.017
[grunting]

13:08.088 --> 13:10.157
Clear off as many
snakes as you can.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.358
[grunts]

13:16.463 --> 13:20.033
Wow! Total snake invasion.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.043
Why am I so good?

13:30.077 --> 13:31.811
It's a curse really.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.816
Oh! Great.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.923
Whoa!

13:42.956 --> 13:44.424
Nya, what are you doing here?

13:44.457 --> 13:47.027
Came to warn you about
the metal-stealing snakes

13:47.060 --> 13:48.495
but it looks like
you already know.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.163
- Uh, how's Zane?
- He's, uh..

13:50.197 --> 13:52.565
(Zane)
All the goggles
on our vegetables.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.001
'Fifty-three, eleven.'

13:54.034 --> 13:56.536
Uh, we're still
working out some kinks.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.038
[gasps]

14:13.453 --> 14:14.922
[cackling]

14:17.657 --> 14:22.029
- Fleeing sauce is out.
- That's right. Bring it on!

14:23.997 --> 14:26.099
Oh-ho! Oh!

14:26.133 --> 14:27.935
Oh, my..

14:27.968 --> 14:29.669
[growling]

14:29.702 --> 14:32.405
Free the trope men, Dareth.

14:32.439 --> 14:35.175
Sorry, uh, my back's
totally jacked again.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.311
These guys took your trophies.

14:38.345 --> 14:42.682
Brown Ninja vengea-ance!

14:42.715 --> 14:44.184
[grunting]

14:46.119 --> 14:48.655
- Ooh!
- Ow!

14:48.688 --> 14:49.689
My leg!

14:49.722 --> 14:50.924
I think you broke it.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.961
Gotta get more sna-a-akes!

14:54.694 --> 14:56.964
Nya, where you going?

14:56.997 --> 14:59.499
[grunting]
Come on!

14:59.532 --> 15:01.468
Jay! Cole! Let's go!

15:05.638 --> 15:07.540
[grunting]

15:07.574 --> 15:11.544
So, does anyone have a plan?

15:11.578 --> 15:14.414
Welcome to Ninjago!

15:23.323 --> 15:25.058
No! They failed!

15:25.092 --> 15:27.694
And we haven't collected
nearly enough metal yet.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.596
No, you haven't.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.298
Uh, was she here the whole time?

15:31.331 --> 15:34.101
Your plan didn't
just have a stupid name.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.569
It was also a stupid idea.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.306
So, now, it's my turn.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.374
Commence with
Operation Blackout.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.283
That should buy the time you'll
need to collect more metal

15:50.317 --> 15:53.553
assuming you don't mess that up
as you did this.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.723
"Operation Blackout."

15:56.756 --> 15:58.525
Good name.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.330
- You're worried.
- Yes.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.432
- Master Wu looks pale.
- No.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.068
I mean, you're worried
about Cole, Jay, and Kai.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.503
No. I'm mad at them.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.406
I gave them an order
and they disobeyed me.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.142
So, not worried at all.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.378
Okay, fine.
But you heard Master Wu.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.481
He wished I was there for him
when he fought Acronix.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.184
I won't leave
and disappoint him again.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.354
Y-you did not
disappoint me, Lloyd.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.655
Oh, master.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.224
When I said I wished
you were there

16:31.258 --> 16:35.195
I was speaking of you, the team.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.630
If I brought
the entire group

16:37.664 --> 16:40.033
perhaps things
would be different.

16:41.268 --> 16:45.072
You still appear concerned.
What is it?

16:45.105 --> 16:48.675
My first time in charge
and I blew it.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.111
The guys ignored my orders.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.381
Master, what do I do now?

16:54.414 --> 16:55.515
[sighs]

16:57.317 --> 17:00.187
Ugh. I'm no leader.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.589
All I do is make mistakes.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.624
May I tell you a secret?

17:04.657 --> 17:06.826
Master Wu makes mistakes too

17:06.859 --> 17:08.261
'a lot of them.'

17:08.295 --> 17:09.529
The true measure of a leader

17:09.562 --> 17:12.265
is not whether
he makes mistakes.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.667
It is whether
he learns from them.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.337
Wu's mistake was going in alone.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.507
So was mine.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.510
I'm supposed to be
fighting alongside my friends.

17:23.543 --> 17:27.447
Yes. Even if they aren't
ready to follow you yet..

17:28.181 --> 17:29.582
...they will be.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.451
But I don't know where they are.

17:34.321 --> 17:37.324
Okay. That's a pretty big clue.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.327
Thanks, mom.

17:42.329 --> 17:45.465
(Misako)
You can stop pretending now.

17:45.498 --> 17:48.735
Lloyd must learn
to make his own decisions.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.304
He will be a real master
soon enough.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.274
And by the way..

17:54.307 --> 17:58.611
...I do not make
a lot of mistakes.

17:59.812 --> 18:03.183
No. Just one big one.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.122
What took you so long?

18:09.156 --> 18:11.191
We were, uh-uh.. Hey!

18:11.224 --> 18:12.592
How'd you know those
whatever they are's

18:12.625 --> 18:13.393
would be coming here?

18:13.426 --> 18:15.262
Well, when all
the power went out

18:15.295 --> 18:17.130
I assumed they
must be at the source.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.732
You figured that out
yourself? Nice.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.401
We had to follow them.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.203
I should've been following them
with you guys

18:23.236 --> 18:24.504
from the beginning.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.607
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Yeah, so are we.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.543
So, what's the plan,
Temporary Master Lloyd?

18:30.577 --> 18:32.145
In training.

18:32.179 --> 18:35.348
We go in there
and kick some snake butt.

18:35.382 --> 18:38.151
Or whatever passes
for a snake's butt.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.852
- Like it?
- I love it!

18:39.886 --> 18:41.521
Yeah! That's a great plan!

18:41.554 --> 18:44.524
The treadmill
was invented in 1818.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.262
Alright, snakes, time to..

18:50.897 --> 18:52.732
Where are they?

18:52.765 --> 18:55.134
The place looks empty.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.538
Zane, you detecting any snakes?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.647
Cranberries. Corkscrew. Squab.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.750
Multiple contacts,
six meters in.

19:10.783 --> 19:14.454
Uh, after a while you start
to pick up on the meaning.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.459
That's a bunch
of office warriors, literally!

19:19.492 --> 19:22.795
Okay, let's do this!
All of us!

19:22.829 --> 19:24.931
- All of us?
- Oh, right.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.599
Zane, stay here.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.668
Mute.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.737
(all)
Ninjago!

19:31.904 --> 19:33.373
[dramatic music]

19:37.310 --> 19:39.412
You don't look so big.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.813
[growls]

19:40.847 --> 19:42.615
A-and now you do.

19:42.649 --> 19:43.750
[growling]

19:46.619 --> 19:49.656
A desk is no good
without a chair!

19:49.689 --> 19:51.491
Have a seat.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.293
Oh, come on!

19:53.826 --> 19:55.295
[grunting]

19:56.596 --> 19:58.531
I hate not having the full team.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.333
We could really use Zane's help.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.702
Right now,
he basically has one move.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.738
Short himself out
with a massive blast of power.

20:05.772 --> 20:09.709
'It creates a magnetic field
that yanks off their armor.'

20:09.742 --> 20:11.778
Those turbines,
they're basically

20:11.811 --> 20:13.913
big, rotating
electromagnets, right?

20:13.946 --> 20:15.915
Yeah, basically, uh..

20:15.948 --> 20:17.984
[grunting]

20:18.017 --> 20:20.687
So, if Zane were to hook in
directly and super charge

20:20.720 --> 20:23.256
one of them, all this
metal armor the snakes have..

20:23.290 --> 20:24.657
I'm on it!

20:24.691 --> 20:26.259
Zane! I need you.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.461
Pug knock!

20:28.495 --> 20:31.498
We have to buy Nya
a little time.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.765
Ninjago!

20:34.667 --> 20:35.768
[grunting]

20:39.406 --> 20:41.674
Got it! Now, Zane, now!

20:41.708 --> 20:45.312
(Zane)
'Goggle's my buddy.
Goggle's my buddy!'

20:45.345 --> 20:47.013
We need more juice.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.848
- Zane!
- On it.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.350
[screams]

20:58.858 --> 21:00.259
Boo!

21:00.960 --> 21:03.896
That's right. Slither away!

21:03.930 --> 21:06.032
Way to go, Nya!

21:06.065 --> 21:07.500
[gasps]
It was Lloyd's plan.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.302
Wait to go, Master Lloyd.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.838
Yeah, you forgot
the temporary and training part.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.407
I know.
Don't let it go to your head.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.743
Uh, not to ruin the feel-goods

21:16.776 --> 21:18.778
but maybe we should
save the celebrating

21:18.811 --> 21:21.548
for after we get
the power and Zane back on?

21:23.015 --> 21:26.853
One more switch, and..

21:26.886 --> 21:30.457
Huh. Well, we know
civilization has been restored.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.059
The TV is working again.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.494
Hello, everyone.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.663
- What have I missed?
- Oh, not much.

21:36.696 --> 21:39.399
Missing people and snakes
trying to steal your metal skin.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.900
But we kicked their butts.

21:40.933 --> 21:44.337
If in fact they have butts.
It's still an open question.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.038
But for now, it's game over.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.341
Uh, I'm not sure that's..

21:48.375 --> 21:50.577
Snakes are attacking
Monster Amusement Park.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.913
They appear to be after anything
metal that isn't nailed down

21:53.946 --> 21:56.549
including the nails themselves.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.618
Ninja, we're leaving.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.823
Nya, when this is all over

22:03.856 --> 22:05.758
there's something
I need to tell you.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.961
- Something important.
- Okay, big brother.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.498
An amusement park, really?

22:11.531 --> 22:13.633
- Do these guys hate fun?
- Nah.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.969
- More like they love metal.
- It's agreed.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.672
I cannot think of a better place
to steal them from.

22:19.706 --> 22:22.542
I'm sure you concur, P.I.X.A.L.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.444
- P.I.X.A.L.?
- Now, let's roll.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.813
I've got a Samurai X suit
to get back!

22:28.881 --> 22:30.550
Wait!

22:30.583 --> 22:33.720
Is a better place. A scrap yard.

22:33.753 --> 22:37.857
Like the one
that belongs to my parents?

22:37.890 --> 22:40.359
