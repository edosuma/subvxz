Carl and Scooby were murdered.
Stabbed to death in a sewer. 

01:40.521 --> 01:43.081
[Cop] Now Antwon cuts a deal
with D.E.A. andjust walks?

01:43.190 --> 01:45.556
[Monica]
The deal was made behind my back.

01:45.660 --> 01:48.220
- [Cop #2] That shithead killed two of us.
- / know.

01:48.329 --> 01:50.854
I'm assured that Antwon's cooperation
will lead to numerous arrests.

01:50.965 --> 01:52.557
[Cop #1]
Except the prick who organized it.

01:52.667 --> 01:54.635
Should've put a bullet in him
when we had the chance.

01:54.735 --> 01:59.138
The feeling is understandable, but / need
everyone to be professional in the street.

02:00.408 --> 02:02.968
This is as painful to me as it is to you.

02:03.077 --> 02:06.137
Hood's happy. Kill a cop,
cut a deal with D.E.A. and skate.

02:06.247 --> 02:08.806
[Monica] The department's looking
into that arrangement.

02:08.916 --> 02:11.908
We're gonna do everything we can
to make sure this doesn't happen again.

02:12.019 --> 02:14.385
[Female Cop] So the ship's sailed?
Antwon's free?

02:14.488 --> 02:17.048
And there's nothing
we can do about it.

02:18.826 --> 02:22.728
/s it true that they're pulling the plug
on the seizure policy?

02:22.830 --> 02:26.857
The policy's being discussed by Pol Com
tomorrow. No decision's been made yet.

02:26.967 --> 02:29.800
We're dropping like damn flies,
and nobody's paying for it.

02:29.904 --> 02:32.998
We are really hurting
and angry right now.

02:33.107 --> 02:35.302
But we've got a job to do...

02:35.409 --> 02:39.004
so let's do it.

02:42.383 --> 02:45.443
We have got to undermine
Antwon's deal with D.E.A.

02:45.553 --> 02:48.579
The same thought's
been ringing in our ear too.

02:48.689 --> 02:52.352
What about Aceveda and Phillips?
You're hanging from a pretty thin rope.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.724
Yeah, they disagree with me
about a couple of things...

02:54.829 --> 02:57.093
but there's one thing
we don't disagree on...

02:57.198 --> 03:01.294
and that's wanting to see Antwon
in a short stay on death row.

03:01.402 --> 03:06.897
Even so, brass'll never sign off on us
undercutting a D.E.A. investigation.

03:07.007 --> 03:10.670
That's why they can't find out about it...
until after we pull it off.

03:12.546 --> 03:15.379
[Julien]
Help Danny through this trial.

03:15.483 --> 03:18.975
Guide her, Lord.
Give her strength in adversity.

03:19.086 --> 03:21.077
Oh, Jesus, Julien.

03:21.188 --> 03:23.383
Amen.

03:23.491 --> 03:26.619
- How you doin'?
- Oh, I'm okay.

03:28.829 --> 03:32.094
/ just can't handle all the "Save her, Lord'"
stuff right now, you know.

03:32.199 --> 03:35.396
Anyway, he already did, right?

03:35.503 --> 03:37.664
Look, I was just waiting
for you to wake up.

03:37.772 --> 03:40.263
I thought I'd say a prayer.

03:40.374 --> 03:45.334
Well, as long as you're talking to the man
upstairs, just ask him for a Vicodin.

03:48.182 --> 03:50.673
Thanks for your prayers.

03:50.785 --> 03:53.948
I'll come back later.
I'll help you home.

03:54.054 --> 03:56.420
That'd be great. Thanks.

03:59.093 --> 04:00.958
Anything?

04:01.061 --> 04:03.052
I checked into
Aceveda and Antwon.

04:03.164 --> 04:05.064
Aceveda only visited
Antwon one time.

04:05.166 --> 04:08.727
- No phone calls, no letters.
- Aceveda visited another inmate
before that though.

04:08.836 --> 04:11.703
- Who?
- Juan Lozano.

04:11.806 --> 04:13.706
- Who's that?
- You mean who was that.

04:13.808 --> 04:16.675
The Byz Lat who grabbed Aceveda's gun,
then got busted by him for armed robbery.

04:16.777 --> 04:20.803
- What happened to him?
- Took a 40-pound dumbbell
to the back of the head in County.

04:20.915 --> 04:23.315
Bled out in his cell.

04:23.417 --> 04:26.284
So Aceveda meets with Juan,
then with Antwon.

04:26.387 --> 04:28.651
Antwon gets a deal.
Juan gets killed.

04:28.756 --> 04:30.724
What the hell is up with that?

04:32.326 --> 04:34.521
[Laughing]

04:34.628 --> 04:36.755
What?

04:36.864 --> 04:40.823
I heard you visited Juan Lozano
in County the other day.

04:40.935 --> 04:43.870
Here's your doll. Go play.
I'll be right there.

04:48.209 --> 04:50.575
Yeah, he's filed an appeal.

04:50.678 --> 04:52.578
Claims that / forced his confession.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.774
Oh, lucky for you
he had a little sports injury.

04:55.883 --> 04:59.148
Somebody in County went
Mr. Universe on his skull.

04:59.253 --> 05:01.221
Guy's dead.

05:01.322 --> 05:03.153
We can't say
the world will miss him.

05:03.257 --> 05:06.715
- Seems to have a lot of enemies.
- Especially you.

05:08.329 --> 05:11.457
I've been going over the paperwork
for his arrest last year.

05:11.565 --> 05:14.591
First he assaults you,
takes your gun.

05:14.702 --> 05:17.296
Then you make the collar,
put him away.

05:17.404 --> 05:20.066
Go visit him at County.
Next thing you know, he's dead.

05:20.174 --> 05:24.873
Well, he's not the first person
to piss off the wrong inmate in jail.

05:28.515 --> 05:33.418
Instead of rehashing the past, I was hoping
that you could help us with the future.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.613
In what way?

05:35.723 --> 05:39.557
Your boyJuan- He have a relationship
with Antwon Mitchell?

05:39.660 --> 05:42.288
Maybe Antwon was
the inmate he pissed off.

05:42.396 --> 05:45.456
Juan seemed pretty desperate.
He lost his juice up in Terminal Island.

05:45.566 --> 05:49.593
Maybe he thought going after Antwon
would get him back his street cred.

05:49.703 --> 05:51.933
Antwon found out and struck first?

05:52.039 --> 05:56.442
/fJuan was bludgeoned after Antwon
made his deal with the D.E. A...

05:56.543 --> 05:58.568
it could kill his immunity.

05:58.679 --> 06:00.943
That's where you come in.

06:01.048 --> 06:03.812
I'm sorry I ever
gave those guys a hand.

06:03.918 --> 06:07.012
Then for Antwon to be responsible
for our cops' deaths.

06:07.121 --> 06:09.248
Now maybe this Juan too.

06:09.356 --> 06:12.291
Give me some time.
I'll look into it.

06:16.130 --> 06:18.360
Nice to have you on board.

06:24.338 --> 06:29.537
Bonilla? He's the solo gatekeeper
between U.S. dirt and El Salvador, man.

06:29.643 --> 06:31.668
And old-school crazy.

06:31.779 --> 06:35.943
You know, a technophobe.
No cell phone, no e-mail.

06:36.050 --> 06:38.211
Everything gets
hand-delivered to him.

06:38.319 --> 06:40.446
Now, I say everything.
I mean everything.

06:40.554 --> 06:44.285
Shipments, distribution,
slaughter crews.

06:44.391 --> 06:47.588
They all go through him
and him only.

06:47.695 --> 06:50.596
That's why you guys keep
coming up with these dead-ends.

06:52.566 --> 06:55.399
[Agent On Monitor] He's the only one
that deals directly with the cartel?

06:55.502 --> 06:57.561
Here's the rest
of what we have on Mitchell.

06:57.671 --> 07:00.834
- [Antwon] He's the /acocca.
- I hope it helps.

07:00.941 --> 07:03.739
[Man] We could've sent
an agent over to pick these up.

07:03.844 --> 07:08.213
/ wanted to see him for one last time
before you send him off to Shangri-la.

07:08.315 --> 07:11.045
[Agent]
You know his full name?

07:11.151 --> 07:13.711
I only know him as Bonilla.

07:13.821 --> 07:17.917
Cat's got to be
about 50, 60 years old.

07:18.025 --> 07:21.290
He's given us more in a day
than we got in a year.

07:23.864 --> 07:27.425
But the deal's only good
ifhis testimony...

07:27.534 --> 07:30.196
leads to arrests and convictions.

07:30.304 --> 07:33.068
Only reason we do it.

07:33.173 --> 07:35.073
It's gonna be huge.

07:36.710 --> 07:38.678
They get the messages to him.

07:38.779 --> 07:41.111
/ know it's painful.

07:44.351 --> 07:46.251
You have no idea.

07:47.855 --> 07:51.052

This Bonilla is the key to 'em all.

08:06.440 --> 08:10.171
/ just came from the D.E.A. safe house
where they're keeping Antwon.

08:10.277 --> 08:12.336
Hope Mr. Mitchell's comfortable.

08:12.446 --> 08:15.882
The key target he's giving up
is an El Salvadoran named Bonilla.

08:15.983 --> 08:17.883
- Name ring a bell?
- No.

08:17.985 --> 08:20.078
He's either lyin'...

08:20.187 --> 08:23.179
or this Bonilla is way high
on the food chain.

08:23.290 --> 08:26.919
So we got half a Latino name
in a city of four million Latinos?

08:27.027 --> 08:30.690
We should rattle our boy Gusano. Shake
the Salvadorean tree, see if Bonilla falls out.

08:30.798 --> 08:32.698
Yeah, this guy
is Antwon's biggest chit.

08:32.799 --> 08:37.203
If we can take down that asshole first,
we'd blow Mitchell's leverage.

08:37.304 --> 08:39.499
Then we could barter with the D.E.A.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.403
Bonilla for Antwon. Straight up.

08:41.508 --> 08:43.999

- Shut up!

08:54.021 --> 08:56.319
What the hell do you want?

08:56.423 --> 09:00.120
We smelled smoke. Thought
the whole place might burn down.

09:00.227 --> 09:04.288
- But since we're already here-
- Bullshit! Get outta here!

09:04.398 --> 09:06.366
- Tear the place apart.
- You got it, man.

- All right.

09:28.989 --> 09:32.516
- We're gonna go check this out.
- Get him down.

- Wedding?
- Quinceañera, probably.

10:04.758 --> 10:07.989
- It wasn't his fault.
- He wasn't supposed to come.

10:08.095 --> 10:10.325
- Papi told you.
- What's your boyfriend's name?

10:13.033 --> 10:15.365
Alejandro.

10:15.469 --> 10:20.304
My papi hated him.
He told Xylina to keep him away.

10:22.376 --> 10:24.742
- Did Alejandro shoot him?
- No.

10:24.845 --> 10:27.313

to the parking lot to talk to Alejandro...

10:30.584 --> 10:32.677

13:59.126 --> 14:02.027
- How did Pitarrio get in touch with him?
- Called him.

14:02.129 --> 14:04.996
- I never knew the number.
- Do you know anyone else connected with him?

14:05.098 --> 14:07.896
Any friends? Associates?

14:08.001 --> 14:11.129
Have you ever heard of a guy
called Bonilla?

14:11.238 --> 14:14.264
/ met Gusano's girlfriend.
She knew / had a kid...

14:14.374 --> 14:17.172
so I babysat for her
a couple of times.

14:17.277 --> 14:19.677
- Where'd you babysit?
- At her place.

14:22.549 --> 14:24.449
- Rosaria?
- Sí.

14:24.551 --> 14:26.542
Get out. Get out.

14:29.389 --> 14:31.983
- [Chattering]
- Clear!

14:32.092 --> 14:35.186
- Clear.
- Looks like a little family vacation.

14:40.133 --> 14:43.261
It's off Rampart.
I shop there.

14:43.370 --> 14:45.429
That explains a few things.

14:45.539 --> 14:48.099
Come on, brother. Let's go get you
the arresting officer's discount.

This must be horrible for you.

14:59.119 --> 15:01.917
Your father killed
on your quinceañera.

15:02.022 --> 15:04.684
Look, we believe you
when you say he didn't do it.

15:04.791 --> 15:08.352
But he knows who did.
And if we can't clear Alejandro...

15:08.462 --> 15:10.987
that makes your boyfriend
an accessory to murder.

15:11.097 --> 15:13.088
But he didn't shoot him.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.828
But he's protecting the killer.

15:15.936 --> 15:18.700
Your boyfriend's friend

15:18.805 --> 15:21.706
My father tried
to throw 'em both out.

15:21.808 --> 15:27.269
Why'd he have to do that?
It was my quinceañera.

15:27.380 --> 15:30.577
Alejandro is scared,
and he should be.

15:30.684 --> 15:32.584
He'll go to prison.

But if you don't mind waiting-

You listen to me, shithead.

I did you a favor
by gettin' that tar back to you.

17:13.286 --> 17:15.413
Whatever that crap was,
it wasn't tar.

I tried to pass that fake shit
down to one of my hookups.

17:18.157 --> 17:22.253
Looked like I was trying to play his ass. I had to
kick him down with two keys to make it right.

17:22.362 --> 17:24.454
So don't think I owe you a favor.

17:24.564 --> 17:28.933
- Don't dick me around.
- You left me holding a pile of shit.

- [Door Closes]
- Gusano claims the dope we returned was bogus.

17:35.342 --> 17:39.472
- Is that possible?
- Pitarrio sometimes had me thin out his supply.

- Not thin. Fake.
- / don't know nothin'about that.

17:46.186 --> 17:49.349

- We'll keep you hidden.

No names. But look at these.

17:55.428 --> 17:58.124
- They're coded.
- Yeah. Third grade code.

to every number.

18:02.369 --> 18:05.668
- Let me see that.
- Hey, Vic.

18:08.208 --> 18:12.042
So I looked into this possible relationship
between Juan Lozano and Antwon Mitchell.

18:12.145 --> 18:14.045
There's no connection.

18:14.147 --> 18:17.412
Except you visited both of them in prison
the day Lozano was killed.

18:17.517 --> 18:20.543
Look, Juan was killed before Antwon
made his deal, so there's no violation.

18:20.654 --> 18:22.884
- So basically you got zero?
- Yeah.

18:22.989 --> 18:26.982
Maybe I should do some digging
into what got this Juan killed.

18:27.093 --> 18:31.393
Why do I get the feeling that you're
actually working another angle?

18:31.498 --> 18:34.956
Maybe I should do some digging
to see what you're up to today.

18:37.137 --> 18:42.040
If we can bust the main target
of the D.E.A.'s case, this Bonilla...

18:42.142 --> 18:46.272
we can kill Antwon's deal,
get him to pay for Carl and Scooby.

18:46.379 --> 18:49.280

bottles in his car when we picked him up.

All from the same place.

21:38.985 --> 21:40.885

some new kids in that house. Teenagers.

One of them goes to school
with our shooter.

to be shut down.

- No, I'm just gonna, um-

and probably fall asleep.

is under appeal.

We have criminal charges
pending against them.

Misdemeanor charges.
And they're presumed innocent.

forced down her throat...

- What?
- If you won't shut it down, I will.

23:05.104 --> 23:07.664
- Isn't that a little bit out of your realm?
- Excuse me.

about it tomorrow.

it doesn't help your policy or you.

Well, this was the Walkers' second strike.
I'm not gonna give them a third.

So do it. I'll take the heat.

There's nothing you can do about it.

we don't get caught in the middle again.

yes-man jellyfish...

- Bonilla. You been with him all day?

He in town.
I'm with him every day.

Anybody drop by his club,
tipping him off about the cops, huh?

24:32.959 --> 24:35.826
- He don't tell me shit.
- I don't have time for this.

- [Mackey] Oh, shit.

24:45.138 --> 24:48.471
There's some blood in that.
Looks like an ulcer.

24:48.574 --> 24:52.032
- If you don't get that thing treated-
- It'll kill me. I know.

24:52.145 --> 24:54.340
That's the plan.

24:58.317 --> 25:00.217
Here's a new plan.

25:00.319 --> 25:02.549
I'm gonna get the city
to pay for your medical bills.

25:02.655 --> 25:05.624
We're gonna fix up your gut, and you're
gonna answer a few questions, all right?

Please don't be screwing with me.

25:09.896 --> 25:11.796
I'm not.

25:14.467 --> 25:17.368

25:17.470 --> 25:20.735
One of his soldiers passed a message.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.740
Really pissed him off.

25:22.842 --> 25:24.742
You know, more than usual.

25:24.844 --> 25:27.711
Something about the stuff
being moved to la cueva.

25:27.814 --> 25:29.748
The cave. What's that?

Antwon gave up Gusano to D.E.A.

25:40.259 --> 25:42.989
Lamberti and Phillips are taking
him away in about two minutes.

25:43.096 --> 25:46.156
We only need him for one.
Get his phone.

You have time for one
phone call. Make it now.

- Yes, sir.

43:40.105 --> 43:43.666
Don't know if you heard what happened,
but your captain's been relieved of duty.

43:43.775 --> 43:47.074
- Yes.
- We need someone to cover
in an interim capacity.

43:47.179 --> 43:50.615
Claudette's the best person.
She's learned-

43:50.715 --> 43:53.183
I'd like you to step up.

43:53.285 --> 43:56.118
- Me?
- There's no guarantees...

43:56.221 --> 43:58.314
but if it works out,
it could be permanent.

44:00.392 --> 44:02.917
Uh, I'm sorry. I can't.

44:03.028 --> 44:06.122
Not that I'm not honored-
flattered-

44:06.231 --> 44:08.222
but, uh, I can't leave my partner.

44:08.333 --> 44:10.631
I'm more valuable
to you on the street.

44:10.735 --> 44:12.635
Well, I'd like you upstairs.

44:14.306 --> 44:18.572
To be honest, if you think
I'm the kind of guy you're looking for...

44:18.677 --> 44:20.736
you've made a mistake.

44:22.380 --> 44:24.280
I'm sorry.

44:35.360 --> 44:37.260
What was that about?

44:37.362 --> 44:40.763
He asked me to be
the company yes-man jellyfish.

44:42.334 --> 44:44.302
I told him to shove it.

44:44.402 --> 44:47.496
Sometimes you have to take
the moral high ground.

44:47.606 --> 44:49.506
One day you'll understand.

44:57.816 --> 45:00.250
Uh, we're all heading over toJamie's...

45:00.352 --> 45:05.187
to celebrate nailing Antwon
and closing Carl and Scooby's case.

45:05.290 --> 45:07.485
Wanna join?

45:08.927 --> 45:11.555
/'m sure we could all use a few.

45:14.866 --> 45:17.664
[Country]

45:19.471 --> 45:21.666
Dutch-boy!

45:21.773 --> 45:26.073
[Indistinct]... in the hood.
I swear to God!

45:26.177 --> 45:30.307
[Chattering Continues]

45:30.415 --> 45:33.077
/t's Danny.

45:33.184 --> 45:35.345
- [Cheering]
- All right!

45:35.453 --> 45:38.752
[All Cheering]

45:38.857 --> 45:40.848
Danny.

45:42.694 --> 45:44.958
[Chattering Continues]

45:45.063 --> 45:48.624
- You want a beer?
- Uh, no. I'm still on pain medication.

45:48.733 --> 45:51.964
- Anybody got a glass?
- [All Laughing]

45:52.070 --> 45:55.767
Hey, hey, get 'em up.
Get 'em up! Come on!

45:58.476 --> 46:03.072
To Carl and Scooby,
a couple of good cops.

46:03.181 --> 46:05.411
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

46:26.504 --> 46:31.032
- [Continues]
- [Chattering]

46:41.786 --> 46:44.846
Do not fear!

46:44.956 --> 46:47.720
[Chattering Continues]

47:07.612 --> 47:09.580
Rent a room!

47:19.023 --> 47:20.888
[Rock]

47:20.992 --> 47:23.426
[Continues]

47:49.521 --> 47:51.887
[Ends]
