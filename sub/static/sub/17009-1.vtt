<i>(# "Let's Misbehave")</i>

01:23.940 --> 01:28.331
# <i>We're all alone,</i>
<i>no chaperone can get our number</i>

01:28.460 --> 01:30.576
# <i>The world's in slumber</i>

01:30.700 --> 01:32.770
# <i>Let's misbehave</i>

01:32.900 --> 01:36.973
# <i>There's something wild about you,</i>
<i>child, that's so contagious</i>

01:37.500 --> 01:39.650
# <i>Let's be outrageous</i>

01:39.780 --> 01:41.736
# <i>Let's misbehave</i>

01:42.300 --> 01:45.690
# <i>When Adam won Eve's hand,</i>
<i>he wouldn't stand for teasin'</i>

01:46.620 --> 01:50.659
# <i>He didn't care about</i>
<i>those apples out of season</i>

01:51.220 --> 01:55.577
# <i>They say that spring</i>
<i>means just one thing to little lovebirds</i>

01:55.700 --> 01:57.850
# <i>We're not above birds</i>

01:57.980 --> 01:59.936
# <i>Let's misbehave</i>

02:26.580 --> 02:28.536
# <i>Let's misbehave</i>

02:35.540 --> 02:36.734
# <i>Let's misbehave</i>

02:36.860 --> 02:41.172
# <i>If you'd be just so sweet</i>

02:41.300 --> 02:45.976
# <i>'Twould be the great event of 1928, dear</i>

02:55.300 --> 02:57.256
# <i>Let's misbehave</i>

03:14.140 --> 03:16.096
# <i>Let's misbehave!</i>

03:30.860 --> 03:32.816
Well...

03:32.940 --> 03:34.896
...a most excellent feast!

03:35.020 --> 03:36.976
<i>(all)</i> Hear, hear!

03:38.500 --> 03:41.298
Soon we will retire
to the royal bedchamber.

03:41.420 --> 03:45.857
But first, as I have been victorious
this week in battle...

03:45.980 --> 03:47.936
<i>(cheering)</i>

03:48.060 --> 03:50.290
...I wish to be amused. Bring me my fool.

03:50.420 --> 03:52.376
<i>(fanfare)</i>

04:00.060 --> 04:02.779
Your Majesty, it's great
to be back at the palace.

04:02.900 --> 04:06.449
You know what the palace is -
24 living rooms and a dungeon.

04:10.060 --> 04:14.099
But seriously... I love the king. He's one
of the strongest men here, isn't he?

04:14.220 --> 04:17.656
He's the only one amongst us
that can swim the moat lengthwise.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.736
Cos...

04:20.820 --> 04:23.288
I know you're out there.
I can hear you breathing!

04:23.420 --> 04:26.332
But seriously, ladies and germs,
I wanna say that...

04:26.460 --> 04:28.371
...that plague is really something!

04:28.500 --> 04:30.968
Doesn't everything look black?!

04:31.780 --> 04:34.169
Cos it's a... a black... a black plague!

04:34.300 --> 04:37.098
Save it up and let me hear it
at the end... big.

04:37.220 --> 04:41.133
And, uh... I love the new exercise
His Majesty does to keep in shape.

04:41.260 --> 04:43.216
It's called taxing peasants.

04:46.900 --> 04:49.858
But seriously... the... the best... thing...

04:49.980 --> 04:52.653
I can't stand it any longer!

04:52.780 --> 04:54.657
He's not funny!

04:54.780 --> 04:57.453
I've cut men in half
for making jokes as bad as that!

04:57.580 --> 04:59.969
- But, sire...
- Get me a fool who's funny!

05:00.700 --> 05:02.656
Go on! The feast is over!

05:03.460 --> 05:05.416
Not funny!

05:05.540 --> 05:08.054
Come on! Out, out, out, out!

05:08.180 --> 05:10.648
I do a couple of impressions
that you might like.

05:10.780 --> 05:15.012
L-I'm one of the few guys that can do the
King of France. Not his voice, his walk.

05:15.140 --> 05:19.292
If you've ever noticed, he'll have
that funny motion when he walks.

05:19.420 --> 05:23.891
He's... Don't everybody... burst
into spontaneous applause on this!

05:43.540 --> 05:46.213
- Look where thou goest, fool!
- I beg your puberty.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.979
Thou hast dropped
the royal rubies and emeralds!

05:49.100 --> 05:52.137
I fain wouldst pick it up
and pin it and fain well on thy fain.

05:52.260 --> 05:54.410
- Aye, pin!
- Yes, extend thy fain, madam.

05:54.540 --> 05:58.010
- And I... On the knocker it hangs. Perfect.
- Knock!

05:58.140 --> 06:00.096
Didst I feel right?

06:00.220 --> 06:04.099
Or didst I feel that thy two hands
did upon my royal body cop a feel?

06:04.220 --> 06:08.213
Oh, madam, not I. I surely would never
lay my hands on the royal tomatoes.

06:08.340 --> 06:09.659
Tomatoes?!

06:09.780 --> 06:12.817
Hearken to me. If my husband the king
and my son the doctor...

06:12.940 --> 06:16.899
...walketh near upon these paved paths
and heareth what thou sayest...

06:17.020 --> 06:19.136
...thy life would not be worth
a plug nickel!

06:19.260 --> 06:21.728
But so beautiful do they lay -
one on either side...

06:21.860 --> 06:24.658
That's the way they were made, fool!
Away with thee!

06:28.420 --> 06:30.376
<i>(groans)</i>

06:30.500 --> 06:32.456
Oh... I... I fell on my bells!

06:34.620 --> 06:36.372
TB...

06:36.500 --> 06:38.456
...or not TB?

06:38.580 --> 06:40.536
That is the congestion.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.096
Consumption be done about it?

06:44.220 --> 06:46.176
Of cough. Of cough.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.096
<i>(guard)</i> Ohhh, Jesus!

06:49.220 --> 06:51.176
My jokes grow stale.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.894
I would my life take for a bare bodkin.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.339
If only I could see
the queen's bare bodkin.

06:58.020 --> 07:00.659
Or anybody's bare bodkin, for that matter.

07:00.780 --> 07:03.419
Or a bodkin with a little clothes on it even.

07:04.020 --> 07:05.976
I'm so melancholy.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.568
Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are dead!

07:08.700 --> 07:10.656
Their tailor shop is closed.

07:10.780 --> 07:12.736
<i>(echoing) Felix!</i>

07:12.860 --> 07:14.816
Who calls my name?

07:14.940 --> 07:16.532
<i>Felix!</i>

07:16.660 --> 07:19.777
No one knows I'm here.
Not even my service.

07:20.740 --> 07:24.619
<i>I am the ghost of thy father.</i>

07:24.740 --> 07:26.696
Oh... my father.

07:26.820 --> 07:29.573
You who died in childbirth.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.656
<i>I cannot rest...</i>

07:32.580 --> 07:35.970
<i>... unless thee makes it with the queen.</i>

07:36.540 --> 07:39.577
But she is a queen
and I am a baseborn fool.

07:40.580 --> 07:42.730
I can't screw above my station.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.930
<i>You must know, my son...</i>

07:46.340 --> 07:48.410
<i>... that thy uncle...</i>

07:48.540 --> 07:50.496
<i>... my father...</i>

07:50.620 --> 07:52.850
<i>... poured hemlock in my ear.</i>

07:54.180 --> 07:55.693
Why?

07:55.820 --> 07:57.776
<i>Don't ask me why.</i>

07:58.540 --> 08:01.213
<i>He does that with everybody.</i>

08:01.340 --> 08:03.854
<i>Whenever he sees an ear...</i>

08:04.900 --> 08:08.415
<i>... he likes to pour hemlock in it.</i>

08:08.540 --> 08:11.179
<i>(gasps)</i> Oh, Father!

08:11.300 --> 08:14.736
<i>See the sorcerer, my son.</i>

08:14.860 --> 08:16.816
<i>(fading) The sorcerer!</i>

08:18.860 --> 08:20.930
<i>The sorcerer...</i>

08:21.820 --> 08:23.776
He's gone!

08:23.900 --> 08:25.856
Do I dare sleep with the queen?

08:25.980 --> 08:27.936
And will she sleep with me?

08:28.060 --> 08:31.655
Although she sleeps with the king,
and he wears leotards!

08:31.780 --> 08:33.577
The sorcerer...

08:34.700 --> 08:36.770
Ah! An aphrodisiac!

08:40.620 --> 08:42.655
Do you want a soft one?

08:42.780 --> 08:44.736
A strong one?

08:44.860 --> 08:46.816
Or one that will...

08:46.940 --> 08:49.010
...mmm?

08:49.140 --> 08:52.655
- What can I get without a prescription?
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

08:54.500 --> 08:57.253
This, placed softly...

08:58.180 --> 09:00.136
...in the queen's drink...

09:00.260 --> 09:02.216
...will make her blood boil!

09:02.340 --> 09:05.332
Her passion... unbridled.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.856
Lustful.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.574
- In other words...
- The hots for me.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.656
<i>(chuckles)</i>

09:12.780 --> 09:14.577
Exactly.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.656
But be cautious.

09:16.780 --> 09:19.931
For if His Majesty
should get wind of thy intent...

09:20.060 --> 09:23.416
...he will cut off your legs...

09:23.540 --> 09:25.496
...your arms...

09:25.620 --> 09:27.576
...and your head.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.250
Right... Five out of six is not bad.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.056
Now go.

09:33.180 --> 09:34.533
Yes, sir.

09:34.660 --> 09:36.616
I think your eggs are done.

09:44.660 --> 09:47.299
- Halt! Who goes there?
- It's just the fool.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.615
What business have you
in the royal chamber?

09:49.740 --> 09:52.300
I was just bringing Her Majesty
her orange juice.

09:52.420 --> 09:54.411
But why you? Where is her usual servant?

09:54.540 --> 09:59.534
He... He lies ill on the... kitchen floor with
the pox. A terrible pox all over his socks.

09:59.660 --> 10:03.812
- Get thee hence, fool.
- Yes, I'm getting hence. Immediately. I...

10:04.420 --> 10:06.775
D'you like the way I fooled these guys?

10:20.500 --> 10:22.411
Fool, what dost thou in my chamber?

10:22.540 --> 10:27.170
Madam, I fell by for perchance you might
like a drink - a nice, soothing potion.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.734
Aye, well, I do confess a thirst.
Bringst to me.

10:29.860 --> 10:33.569
Yes. Wouldst grab some of this potion
before the fizz goes out.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.373
- Isn't it wonderful? Mm!
- It bubbleth greatly.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.456
Wolf some down, my lady.

10:38.580 --> 10:40.218
Cheerst!

10:40.340 --> 10:42.296
And Roebuck.

10:47.620 --> 10:49.736
It go down bubblest, but it's fine.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.656
Takest away.

10:55.260 --> 10:58.138
Well, I have to go back now
to the dungeon.

10:58.260 --> 11:00.899
There's a...
To get a deposit on the goblet.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.774
Wait!

11:03.900 --> 11:05.777
Fool, come here.

11:05.900 --> 11:10.769
I have o'er me this extraordinary warmth
that is flowing through my veins...

11:10.900 --> 11:16.054
...that makes me wisht - nay, longst - thou
should run amok over my entire body.

11:16.180 --> 11:19.058
Make love to me now.
Ravage me and take me now. Take me.

11:19.180 --> 11:22.695
- It will be my pleasure.
- Take me to the bed. Make love to me.

11:22.820 --> 11:25.778
- Yes. To the... To the bed.
- Lead me there, fool.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.368
- Yes, I am.
- How this passion groweth within me.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.060
- Right. Come quickly.
- I cannot walk fast, fool.

11:31.180 --> 11:33.899
- <i>(queen)</i> The passion is so great.
- Right. To the bed.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.772
Aye. Haste to the bed.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.856
Right, over here.

11:37.980 --> 11:39.572
Here.

11:39.700 --> 11:44.137
The potion will be under the pillow. If you
lose your hots, we can refurbish them.

11:44.260 --> 11:46.216
- Aye. Comest o'er!
- Oh, yes.

11:46.340 --> 11:49.855
- Run thy hands upon my body.
- I shall. I shall reline your brakes.

11:49.980 --> 11:51.936
Aye. Mmm! Oh, God!

11:52.620 --> 11:55.498
Nay, I needst the feel
of naked flesh against flesh.

11:55.620 --> 11:58.612
I'm all out of naked flesh.
But will the velvet do?

11:59.500 --> 12:01.809
- Kiss me quick.
- Yes. Where <i>is</i> your quick?

12:01.940 --> 12:05.091
- Shh. Canst undress me now?
- I'm kissing my own arm!

12:06.820 --> 12:09.698
Yes. Up quickly
and I will remove the royal dress.

12:10.220 --> 12:11.539
<i>(panting)</i>

12:11.660 --> 12:13.890
Oh, God... Mmm! Oh, God!

12:14.020 --> 12:16.818
Takest off. Pullst not upon me so!

12:18.260 --> 12:21.855
On thy feet, fool. This is
not mockery. This is not games.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.936
Ah! Oh, God...

12:27.020 --> 12:28.976
At la! What... What's this?!

12:29.100 --> 12:30.533
Heavy underwear.

12:30.660 --> 12:34.289
'Tis the chastity belt that
the jealous king hath fastened on me...

12:34.420 --> 12:37.617
...that no man but him shallst
havest the goodst of the body.

12:37.740 --> 12:40.459
That's a bad break for
all of us here at the palace.

12:40.580 --> 12:42.536
Yes... Yes... Wait! Wait here.

12:42.660 --> 12:44.616
L-I... I will go.

12:46.620 --> 12:50.169
Here, now, with most grievous dispatch,
I will open the latch...

12:50.300 --> 12:52.256
...and get to her snatch.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.299
- Quickly.
- Aye.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.376
All right, hold that.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.456
This key is too big for that lock.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.775
<i>(key drops to floor)</i>

13:02.660 --> 13:04.616
- Um...
- Agh!

13:04.740 --> 13:06.696
J-J-Just move back.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.933
<i>(clang)</i>

13:09.060 --> 13:11.096
Sorry about that.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.972
I must think quickly.

13:16.100 --> 13:20.252
Before you know it, the Renaissance
will be here and we'll all be painting.

13:24.140 --> 13:26.131
Her Majesty wishes to borrow this.

13:26.260 --> 13:30.253
She has some food stuck between
her teeth and I need to pull it out.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.848
- Forgive me...
- Argh!

13:32.980 --> 13:34.936
Whoops!

13:39.860 --> 13:40.815
Ah!

13:40.940 --> 13:42.896
Ugh!

13:43.020 --> 13:44.612
No! Agh!

13:44.740 --> 13:47.413
This is what they call beaver shooting.

13:52.820 --> 13:54.856
I wouldst pick this lock.

13:59.860 --> 14:03.569
- There.
- Agh! We did it. It's done.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.053
- Yes.
- And now I am yours.

14:05.180 --> 14:08.650
At last, the portals of ecstasy.
You <i>have</i> got portals of ecstasy?

14:08.780 --> 14:12.250
Be prepared! His Majesty has this day
been awakened by a loud banging!

14:12.820 --> 14:16.290
Be prepared! His Majesty has this day
been awakened by a loud banging!

14:16.420 --> 14:19.537
- He will cleave thee in twain!
- Yes. Cleave me in twain.

14:19.660 --> 14:22.458
Twain over here and twain
on the other side of the room!

14:22.580 --> 14:24.536
Onst chopping block.

14:24.660 --> 14:26.616
Yes. I do not look good in twain.

14:26.740 --> 14:30.858
- My suits are made for a whole person.
- I shall not have this passion fulfilled!

14:30.980 --> 14:36.179
Well, quickly, lock up the... the thing
that you have there. Lock the royal box!

14:36.300 --> 14:38.018
Quickly! Quickly! Before...

14:38.140 --> 14:41.496
- Help me. Help me.
- I'mst helping, but...

14:41.620 --> 14:43.576
Aye, 'tis done.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.214
'Tis locked solid. More solid than any...

14:46.340 --> 14:49.013
M-My hand! 'Tis caught
in the chastity belt.

14:49.140 --> 14:51.700
I always get my hand
in the cookie jar, so to speak.

14:51.820 --> 14:53.856
The king approaches. What canst we do?

14:53.980 --> 14:55.299
- The king?!
- Aye!

14:57.580 --> 14:58.569
Quickly!

14:58.700 --> 15:00.577
Into the dress immediately.

15:01.820 --> 15:04.618
My queen! Where is my queen?

15:04.740 --> 15:07.208
Very casual. As though
nothing had happened.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.773
Queen!

15:08.900 --> 15:10.379
Oh, my queen.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.889
A most dreadful pounding
did awaken me.

15:13.020 --> 15:15.409
Making my mood most foul!

15:15.540 --> 15:17.735
Oh... My lord didst startle me!

15:17.860 --> 15:21.853
Aye, my lord. Be a good king, wouldst
thou, and go and get me a drink of water?

15:21.980 --> 15:25.655
The fool hath made the most
jestfully quipping in thine absence.

15:25.780 --> 15:28.772
Aye, my lord! Tickling
the royal funny bone, so to speak.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.653
Because, you see,
'tis most Ionely when thou nappest.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.736
Aye, my lord. For me, too.

15:33.860 --> 15:35.851
I still don't...

15:35.980 --> 15:37.936
...think he's funny.

15:38.060 --> 15:40.415
I got some new ones for you, my lord.

15:40.540 --> 15:44.658
What's black and white, black and white,
black and white and black and white?

15:44.780 --> 15:46.736
A nun falling down the stairs.

15:46.860 --> 15:48.816
<i>(nervous giggle)</i>

15:48.940 --> 15:50.896
Come give me a kiss.

15:51.020 --> 15:53.215
- Of course. Stick out your tongue.
- Not you!

15:53.340 --> 15:55.296
Now begone!

15:55.420 --> 15:57.729
- That damn fool!
- No!

15:57.860 --> 16:00.294
I... I will accompany thee to the door.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.212
At last.

16:04.340 --> 16:06.570
At last, we are alone.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.975
- Aye, my lord.
- Come to me.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.056
- My lord, I wouldst...
- Mmm! Mmm!

16:11.180 --> 16:13.136
- Nay! Kiss me not!
- To the bed!

16:14.620 --> 16:16.895
I will soon find that key. Where is't?

16:17.020 --> 16:19.932
Ah! Here it is!

16:40.420 --> 16:42.376
Ha-ha-ha! Tickles!

16:44.860 --> 16:46.816
Oh!

16:50.660 --> 16:52.332
Aye, my lord.

16:52.460 --> 16:56.738
Remember you said that if I was ever
in town I should look up your wife?

17:00.300 --> 17:04.771
I don't know what everybody's getting so
upset for. I never humped her, you know.

17:05.980 --> 17:10.291
Just... Just clean up my neck a little
and leave the top full.

17:42.540 --> 17:44.496
Your case.

17:56.020 --> 17:57.055
So...

17:57.180 --> 17:59.057
- Give me a good "ah".
- Ah.

17:59.180 --> 18:00.329
Ah.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.690
...down this side of my arm,
mostly at night.

18:02.820 --> 18:06.495
I don't notice it as much in the daytime,
but at night it bothers me.

18:06.620 --> 18:09.373
I don't want to hurt you,
but how far up can you raise it?

18:09.500 --> 18:11.968
Mr Milos, would you
come with me, please?

18:17.540 --> 18:20.691
Come in, Mr Milos. Come in.
Sit down right over here.

18:20.820 --> 18:23.857
I just want to
get some history on you first.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.256
So...

18:27.380 --> 18:30.133
- Your name is?
- Stavros Milos.

18:30.260 --> 18:32.216
- And your address?
- Armenia.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.136
- Armenia?
- I am from Armenia.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.296
- I am visiting my brother.
- I see.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.376
Um... occupation?

18:39.500 --> 18:40.979
Shepherd.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.056
- A shepherd?
- My whole family.

18:43.180 --> 18:46.297
Except for my brother over here,
who is a rug salesman.

18:46.420 --> 18:47.296
Mm-hm.

18:47.420 --> 18:50.218
- Have you had any major illnesses?
- No.

18:50.340 --> 18:52.296
None. Good.

18:52.980 --> 18:54.459
So...

18:54.580 --> 18:57.094
Now... what seems to be the trouble?

18:57.220 --> 19:00.610
- I'm in love with a sheep.
- I beg your pardon?

19:01.820 --> 19:04.254
I am in love with a sheep.

19:26.180 --> 19:28.296
Oh... I see.

19:28.420 --> 19:32.413
You see, doctor, up there in
the mountains where I tend my flocks...

19:32.540 --> 19:35.008
...it's so beautiful under the starry skies.

19:35.140 --> 19:38.018
And I am alone.
And sometimes it gets so Ionely.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.096
And the hours pass.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.211
And soon I desire a woman.

19:42.340 --> 19:44.296
But, doctor, there are no women.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.376
I am not married and...

19:47.100 --> 19:49.614
Well... one night last summer...

19:50.580 --> 19:52.730
...I could stand it no longer.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.055
My body needed to be satisfied.

19:56.060 --> 19:58.016
And then... I saw her.

19:58.140 --> 19:59.812
Her?

19:59.940 --> 20:02.329
- Daisy.
- Sheep?

20:02.460 --> 20:04.815
I took Daisy off to a little cove...

20:05.660 --> 20:09.255
...and there, under the Armenian sky,
had sexual intercourse.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.572
With the sheep?

20:14.700 --> 20:16.213
Naturally.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.895
Ohhh... God!

20:23.020 --> 20:26.456
It was the greatest lay I ever had.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.096
Mr Milos...

20:30.220 --> 20:33.178
Forgive me if I... seemed at all shocked.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.653
I'm sorry.

20:34.780 --> 20:37.977
Doctor, Mrs Gallbladder's
on the phone about her rupture.

20:38.100 --> 20:40.056
Later. Later...

20:40.180 --> 20:41.613
Uh...

20:41.740 --> 20:43.696
Mr Milos...

20:44.540 --> 20:46.849
Of course, I'm happy for the two of you.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.459
But, um...

20:48.580 --> 20:50.536
...I do have other patients.

20:50.660 --> 20:52.616
And unless there's some...

20:52.740 --> 20:54.776
...specific way...

20:54.900 --> 20:56.856
...that I could help you...

20:56.980 --> 20:59.255
Doctor. Doctor, please. One minute.

20:59.980 --> 21:01.936
See, the point is...

21:02.620 --> 21:04.576
...she no longer loves me.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.656
That's why I'm here.

21:06.780 --> 21:09.374
Because she's fallen out of love with me.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.456
How can you tell that?

21:11.580 --> 21:13.536
Oh... little things.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.570
She's cold. Indifferent.

21:16.700 --> 21:19.658
- Mm-hm?
- Speak to her. She'll listen to you.

21:20.420 --> 21:21.853
Mr Milos...

21:21.980 --> 21:23.936
You are...

21:24.060 --> 21:25.857
...crazy.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.936
I brought her all the way from Armenia.

21:28.060 --> 21:31.257
My brother says you are a great doctor.
You saved his life once.

21:31.380 --> 21:34.258
You need a psychiatrist.
I am a medical doctor.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.016
Speak to her. Please?

21:37.620 --> 21:41.898
- I can't talk to a sheep! Are you nuts?
- She's outside in my brother's truck.

21:42.020 --> 21:44.375
Would you get out of my office, please!

21:44.500 --> 21:46.730
I'm an MD. I'm not a veterinarian!

21:46.860 --> 21:49.738
- I bring her in.
- Don't bring any sheep in this office!

21:49.860 --> 21:54.058
- My mother just got finished paying for it!
- I know no great men of wisdom.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.091
My brother says you are a great man.

21:56.220 --> 21:58.495
I'm not! I'm just an ordinary GP.

21:58.620 --> 22:00.053
- That's all I am!
- I'll get her.

22:00.180 --> 22:03.809
No! Mr Milos! You don't understand.
It's not normal...

22:03.940 --> 22:07.376
...to experience mature love
for anything with four legs!

22:07.500 --> 22:09.297
Wait till you meet her.

22:09.420 --> 22:11.376
I don't believe this.

22:21.500 --> 22:24.651
- Doctor, the prescription you gave me...
- I can't.

22:24.780 --> 22:28.853
I'm sorry. I can't. Would you sit down?!
Would you sit down, Mrs...

22:28.980 --> 22:30.971
- I'll talk to you...
- <i>(bleating)</i>

22:33.100 --> 22:35.614
Doctor Ross, this is Daisy.

22:35.740 --> 22:37.458
Oh... Good.

22:37.580 --> 22:40.572
Um... Why don't you
take her right into my office?

22:42.820 --> 22:45.380
You'll have to excuse me. His sheep has...

22:45.500 --> 22:47.456
...a... a strep throat.

22:52.380 --> 22:54.735
Mr Milos, I'm gonna
have to call the police.

22:54.860 --> 22:59.138
Can we talk for a minute? Mr Milos,
don't put that sheep on my desk! Please!

22:59.260 --> 23:01.569
You shouldn't do that.
You shouldn't do that.

23:01.700 --> 23:04.692
- Isn't Daisy beautiful?
- Yes, she is beautiful.

23:04.820 --> 23:09.689
Mr Milos... You're a very nice man. I don't
want to see you get into any trouble.

23:09.820 --> 23:12.539
What I don't think you understand is that...

23:13.860 --> 23:15.816
...you have...

23:15.940 --> 23:17.976
...a, uh... psychiatric problem.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.456
You really need to see, uh...

23:21.860 --> 23:25.091
...someone in the...
in the, um... psychiatry field.

23:25.220 --> 23:27.176
I'm a medical doctor.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.896
Um...

23:32.100 --> 23:34.056
<i>(bleats)</i>

23:37.660 --> 23:42.734
I know you didn't, uh... mean any harm...
bringing this sheep in here, but...

23:42.860 --> 23:44.816
<i>(bleats)</i>

23:44.940 --> 23:46.896
...I have patients, you know.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.976
Kidney problems and...

23:50.860 --> 23:52.816
...heart problems and...

23:52.940 --> 23:55.295
Seeing a sheep just like that, it's...

23:59.620 --> 24:01.576
Hello, Daisy.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.656
- <i>(bleats)</i>
- She's so...

24:04.660 --> 24:06.616
...wonderful.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.696
I'm, uh...

24:08.820 --> 24:10.776
I'm Dr Ross.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.616
Doug Ross.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.456
She's...

24:26.700 --> 24:28.656
Um...

24:28.780 --> 24:30.657
Mr Milos...

24:30.780 --> 24:32.736
I, uh...

24:32.860 --> 24:35.897
I'd like to see the two of you again, but...

24:36.020 --> 24:39.456
...right now, you know,
my office is jammed full.

24:39.580 --> 24:41.536
Oh, I knew you could help!

24:41.660 --> 24:43.616
Thank you, doctor.

24:43.740 --> 24:45.696
As a matter of fact, uh...

24:45.820 --> 24:47.776
...if I could see Daisy alone...

24:48.420 --> 24:50.376
...maybe, you know, I...

24:50.500 --> 24:52.456
Anything. Anything!

25:00.100 --> 25:02.056
Darling, what's the matter?

25:02.180 --> 25:04.136
Nothing.

25:04.260 --> 25:06.455
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.655
Why don't you turn in early, then? Hm?

25:19.100 --> 25:21.534
What are you doing?

25:21.660 --> 25:23.332
Oh, just nothing.

25:23.460 --> 25:26.213
No, you were fondling
your lamb's-wool sweater.

25:28.940 --> 25:31.773
I was not fondling
my lamb's-wool sweater!

25:31.900 --> 25:34.573
What would I do something like that for?

25:34.700 --> 25:36.656
Well, God knows!

25:43.180 --> 25:44.659
Doctor.

25:44.780 --> 25:47.214
Mr Milos brought in his sheep.

25:47.340 --> 25:49.296
She's here?

25:53.660 --> 25:55.616
All right, show her in.

26:08.660 --> 26:10.616
<i>(gargles)</i>

26:15.180 --> 26:17.694
Thank you. You can... you can go.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.336
Hi...

26:31.980 --> 26:33.936
...darling.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.850
I know this must all seem
very strange to you.

26:39.620 --> 26:42.896
You from the hills of Armenia
and me from Jackson Heights.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.976
And yet...

26:45.100 --> 26:47.056
...I think it could work.

26:47.180 --> 26:49.694
If we gave it a chance.

26:57.820 --> 26:59.378
A room, please.

27:05.660 --> 27:07.616
Oh. Thank you very much.

27:07.740 --> 27:09.696
Wait a second.

27:09.820 --> 27:11.936
There you are.

27:14.620 --> 27:18.056
Oh, uh... do you want
the "Do not disturb" sign on the door?

27:18.980 --> 27:20.936
Oh... th-that's all right. I...

27:21.060 --> 27:22.778
Uh... all right. Yes.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.538
Thank you very much.

27:30.100 --> 27:33.490
Uh... Room service,
this is Dr Ross in room 525.

27:34.340 --> 27:37.571
I would like to have
some chilled white Burgundy...

27:38.340 --> 27:40.615
...a little caviar... and some grass.

27:42.140 --> 27:45.291
Oh, just... plain, green grass.

27:47.580 --> 27:49.536
That's 525.

27:49.660 --> 27:51.616
Thank you.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.173
Daisy.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.898
Little Daisy.

28:01.660 --> 28:03.616
- Let's be gentle.
- <i>(bleats)</i>

28:11.740 --> 28:13.412
I can't...

28:13.540 --> 28:15.496
I'm exhausted. Just...

28:20.380 --> 28:22.336
<i>(sniffs)</i>

28:25.820 --> 28:27.776
Boy!

28:27.900 --> 28:29.856
That was really something.

28:31.660 --> 28:33.935
I never thought it could be like this.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.016
Never in my wildest imagination.

28:37.140 --> 28:39.096
<i>(bleats)</i>

28:39.980 --> 28:42.096
You're really something special.

28:43.140 --> 28:45.096
I love our L-shaped room.

28:46.620 --> 28:49.498
I'll never forget
these afternoons we've had.

28:51.940 --> 28:55.933
I don't think I've ever known
such peace and happiness in my life.

28:57.220 --> 28:59.176
I hope you feel the same way.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.097
<i>(bleats)</i>

29:14.020 --> 29:17.092
Sorry. I'm sorry, honey.
I was out when you phoned.

29:17.220 --> 29:19.176
- Mm.
- Emergency house call.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.416
- Mm! You smell good.
- <i>(sniffs)</i>

29:22.460 --> 29:24.371
- Darling?
- Hm?

29:24.500 --> 29:28.175
Is it my imagination, or do you
always smell from lamb chops?

29:29.100 --> 29:33.298
Lamb chops? What kind of silly thing
is that to say about lamb chops?

29:33.420 --> 29:37.174
How could I <i>possibly</i> smell
of lamb chops? That's not logical.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.495
What... kind of cheap suit is this?

29:40.380 --> 29:42.336
That's it with these suits!

29:53.980 --> 29:55.174
<i>(door bursts open)</i>

29:56.260 --> 29:59.730
Ann! Wait a minute, I can explain!
We're just friends.

29:59.860 --> 30:02.818
- How could you?!
- This is Mrs Bencourse.

30:02.940 --> 30:04.896
One of my patients.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.976
She thinks she's a sheep!

30:07.100 --> 30:10.092
That's all! There's nothing to it!

30:10.220 --> 30:14.418
<i>(man)...</i> defendant did commit
an adulterous act with a sheep.

30:14.540 --> 30:19.056
It's most distasteful in view of the fact
that the sheep was under 18 years old.

30:19.180 --> 30:20.932
So what?

30:21.060 --> 30:24.735
So Ann's left me. So she's taken
all my money, all my savings.

30:24.860 --> 30:26.816
My licence has been revoked.

30:27.980 --> 30:29.936
But I don't care.

30:30.060 --> 30:32.016
If you're willing...

30:32.140 --> 30:34.096
...we'll get by somehow.

30:34.220 --> 30:36.176
I'll get a job. I don't know...

30:43.300 --> 30:45.256
We've been here for an hour.

30:48.420 --> 30:50.376
That's what I ordered.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.651
Waiter, I ordered two sauerkraut!
I didn't order cake!

30:56.540 --> 30:58.656
- Waiter!
- Don't call me waiter!

30:58.780 --> 31:01.931
I'm a doctor! You understand that?
I'm not a waiter!

31:02.060 --> 31:04.972
I am a doctor! Don't call me waiter!
I'm a doctor!

31:07.180 --> 31:08.772
Ah. Say "ah".

31:10.500 --> 31:12.536
Come here! Spread your legs apart!

31:13.580 --> 31:16.299
Couldn't you at least
not have eaten this morning?!

31:16.420 --> 31:19.139
Isn't that...
What kind of a mess is that in there?!

31:23.780 --> 31:25.736
Daisy?

31:28.300 --> 31:29.972
Daisy?

31:30.100 --> 31:32.056
Honey?

31:35.060 --> 31:37.528
<i>"I have finally saved up enough money...</i>

31:38.100 --> 31:41.092
<i>... to come back to America</i>
<i>and take my Daisy home. "</i>

31:42.100 --> 31:47.299
<i>"You did a terrible thing to me, but now</i>
<i>I've taken Daisy to the mountains again...</i>

31:47.420 --> 31:50.093
<i>... where you will never find her. "</i>

31:51.700 --> 31:53.656
<i>"Stavros Milos."</i>

31:55.620 --> 31:57.576
<i>(sobs)</i>

33:12.620 --> 33:14.929
I have waited so long for this moment.

33:17.700 --> 33:22.694
Fabrizio, my darling,
go easy on my hymen.

33:23.020 --> 33:25.090
Gina, your body to me is a cathedral.

33:26.260 --> 33:28.410
Now take off your pants.

33:32.220 --> 33:34.256
Didn't you like it?

33:36.500 --> 33:37.091
Yes.

33:38.700 --> 33:41.134
It didn't look like you were
having fun to me.

33:44.260 --> 33:46.535
Yes. You were wonderful.

33:48.700 --> 33:52.659
But you just lay there -
passive - like a lox.

33:54.380 --> 33:57.372
It was my first time -
did you like it?

33:58.580 --> 34:01.652
Me? Are you kidding?
More fun than laughing.

34:06.300 --> 34:09.610
Maybe next time
I'll be more relaxed.

34:11.940 --> 34:13.896
<i>Sì.</i>

34:15.820 --> 34:17.139
<i>(camera shutter clicking)</i>

34:17.219 --> 34:19.176
<i>Brava! Bravissima!</i>

34:20.260 --> 34:22.056
Marcello, do you know anything
about frigidity?

34:25.500 --> 34:26.649
It's all in the foreplay.

34:27.020 --> 34:29.409
A woman needs to be played with
before you lay her.

34:29.620 --> 34:30.574
How long?

34:31.179 --> 34:32.976
Fifteen minutes, half hour -
depends on the woman.

34:33.820 --> 34:34.616
What about your wife?

34:34.980 --> 34:36.697
Thirty seconds.

34:37.860 --> 34:39.532
Lucky!

34:41.060 --> 34:42.812
Don't tell me Gina's a problem.

34:43.739 --> 34:45.536
Er... no... it's not that.

34:46.420 --> 34:49.935
Do you fondle her before putting it in?

34:50.540 --> 34:53.213
Put what in? Oh!

34:54.020 --> 34:57.012
I don't like to talk about Gina
like she's a whore.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.572
How long have you been married now?

35:00.180 --> 35:01.249
Six weeks.

35:02.980 --> 35:07.098
Play with her. Fondle her.

35:07.340 --> 35:11.697
It's always the man's fault.
Any woman can be made to feel ecstasy.

35:12.740 --> 35:15.732
Last week, in the middle of... of...

35:16.260 --> 35:19.218
She was watching television.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.416
You must be doing something wrong.

35:22.580 --> 35:26.539
Some women take longer.

35:27.860 --> 35:31.091
Find her erogenous zones.

35:31.420 --> 35:37.609
Her father gave me a map
of them, and still...

35:45.260 --> 35:46.488
Okay, turn over.

35:46.620 --> 35:47.336
Huh?

35:47.460 --> 35:52.978
Over. I want to do a quick check
on some parts I missed.

35:53.100 --> 35:55.056
- <i>Ah...</i>
- <i>Sì.</i>

35:55.940 --> 35:57.055
<i>Sì...</i>

35:57.180 --> 35:58.454
Foreplay...

35:58.580 --> 35:59.649
Mmm!

35:59.780 --> 36:02.340
Foreplay...

36:09.140 --> 36:11.096
<i>Eccitare...</i>

36:12.540 --> 36:14.496
<i>Eccitare...</i>

36:16.220 --> 36:18.176
<i>Eccitare...</i>

36:18.900 --> 36:20.856
<i>(snores)</i>

36:23.540 --> 36:27.055
Fabrizio, there is nothing
the church can do for you.

36:27.740 --> 36:31.858
If I could, I would be glad to try
and make your wife come...

36:32.140 --> 36:33.175
...but that is impossible.

36:33.420 --> 36:36.093
At least you get pleasure from her.

36:36.500 --> 36:38.855
Maybe someday she will get it from you.

37:11.860 --> 37:17.139
And here will be my new offices.
A hundred people will work under me.

37:17.700 --> 37:24.333
Yes... Yes, but tell me about
your sex life... your wife.

37:26.700 --> 37:31.330
She moans and screams
and claws my back.

37:32.340 --> 37:34.808
She comes six, seven times.

37:35.100 --> 37:37.978
She's like a wolf in heat.

37:38.620 --> 37:43.375
Mine lays there and stares
at the ceiling. Like a dead one.

37:43.700 --> 37:46.612
Are you... small?

37:47.940 --> 37:52.172
Small? Like a French bread. Small...

37:53.020 --> 37:54.897
Okay, okay... then I don't know.

38:04.620 --> 38:06.451
You're depressed still.

38:06.580 --> 38:08.377
<i>No.</i>

38:08.500 --> 38:09.489
I'm okay.

38:11.140 --> 38:13.335
<i>(Gina sighs)</i>

38:13.460 --> 38:15.849
You're still thinking about it.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.612
Because I love you...
because you're so beautiful...

38:19.860 --> 38:21.771
...and I want you to love me loving you.

38:22.180 --> 38:23.659
Please...

38:29.820 --> 38:31.776
<i>(Gina moans)</i>

38:40.620 --> 38:41.336
What are you doing?

38:41.620 --> 38:44.088
Take me. Do it to me.

38:45.220 --> 38:45.811
Here?!

38:46.140 --> 38:47.937
Yes... yes...

38:53.740 --> 38:55.890
- There's people all around.
- I don't care.

39:00.340 --> 39:01.739
We could get caught!

39:01.980 --> 39:04.972
I know... I know... Do it...

39:07.420 --> 39:08.648
Do it.

39:09.340 --> 39:11.808
Oh, my God! Now she wants it!

39:41.580 --> 39:44.219
Life plays strange tricks on me.

39:44.980 --> 39:48.495
She comes - like an express train.

39:49.140 --> 39:52.769
The next night in bed she lays there...

39:54.140 --> 40:00.409
It's the danger, my friend.
The fear of being caught.

40:01.180 --> 40:05.458
The sinful, mischievous, naughty,
tempting of fate...

40:07.420 --> 40:08.978
That's what she needs.

40:11.180 --> 40:14.775
Mark my words.

40:16.420 --> 40:17.375
No question.

40:17.740 --> 40:20.413
She is weird-city.

40:32.660 --> 40:34.139
Did anyone see Fabrizio?

40:40.220 --> 40:44.179
Listen carefully to what I say.
You'll get caught.

40:44.420 --> 40:46.012
It's dangerous. Don't do it!

40:46.820 --> 40:50.813
We were nearly caught last week.

40:51.380 --> 40:53.416
At the church. In the confessional.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.618
I still have a charlie-horse.

40:57.900 --> 40:59.856
<i>(exasperated sigh)</i>

40:59.980 --> 41:01.777
Stop it before it's too late.

41:24.220 --> 41:25.812
<i>(screams)</i>

41:27.340 --> 41:29.296
<i>(woman screams)</i>

41:31.860 --> 41:33.816
<i>Ma che sta facendo?</i>

41:36.860 --> 41:39.818
<i>Ma questa è una cosa da pazzi!</i>

41:43.660 --> 41:45.810
Are you angry with me?

41:46.140 --> 41:49.655
I love you. At least we know
you're not frigid.

41:51.980 --> 41:54.653
As long as we do it in public.

41:55.860 --> 41:57.930
You'll get used to it.

41:58.900 --> 41:59.969
I'll try.

42:00.660 --> 42:05.290
I knew we'd work things out.

42:10.260 --> 42:12.216
<i>(banging)</i>

42:47.940 --> 42:51.489
<i>(man)</i> Do we have to get there that early?
Where is it written that we do?

42:51.620 --> 42:54.578
Oh, Sam! It's Julie's fiancé's parents.
You wanna be late?

42:54.700 --> 42:56.452
- Listen, Tess.
- Mm?

42:56.580 --> 43:00.653
- I haven't been feeling well lately.
- Oh, come on. It's just psychosomatic.

43:00.780 --> 43:03.169
A tension headache by you
is psychosomatic.

43:03.300 --> 43:05.860
All of a sudden
you've become a psychiatrist?

43:05.980 --> 43:09.370
Stop complaining. It's Alvin's parents,
so it's an obligation.

43:09.500 --> 43:12.890
- An obligation.
- I don't like them any more than you do.

43:13.020 --> 43:15.898
Or should I say it's them that
look down their noses at us?

43:16.020 --> 43:19.137
I heard that! I think
you're both a little paranoid.

43:19.260 --> 43:23.697
Alvin's parents are <i>lovely</i> people.
They like both of you very much.

43:28.700 --> 43:32.375
That's what I call a lawn. Nice, clipped.
Not like my house - overgrown.

43:32.500 --> 43:34.968
- Did you hear George and I...
- Who's your gardener?

43:35.100 --> 43:37.056
- Me! Me!
- You're the gardener?

43:37.180 --> 43:39.569
- Of course.
- Sam, did you see the roses?

43:39.700 --> 43:41.930
- I thought that...
- Oh, please pick...

43:42.060 --> 43:44.016
<i>(romantic piano music)</i>

44:02.980 --> 44:05.813
- Can you give me the recipe?
- You didn't make this yourself?

44:07.100 --> 44:09.898
- Excuse me.
- <i>(Tess)</i> Where are you going, Sam?

44:10.020 --> 44:13.854
- To the bathroom.
- <i>(George)</i> Upstairs, first door to the left.

44:13.980 --> 44:15.413
<i>(woman)</i> Well...

44:31.620 --> 44:35.010
Yes. We prefer Bermuda
to Puerto Rico, let's say.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.051
It's <i>much</i> nicer.

44:40.460 --> 44:42.291
Mm!

44:42.420 --> 44:46.618
Of course, I like... I enjoy wearing
a formal gown once in a while...

44:46.740 --> 44:48.696
...but when I'm on vacation...

44:48.820 --> 44:51.493
...I like to relax and wear slacks...

44:51.620 --> 44:53.576
...or little skirts and blouses.

44:53.700 --> 44:55.577
And sweet little hats.

44:55.700 --> 44:58.419
We, um... Your husband and I
had quite a talk.

44:59.060 --> 45:02.609
He's a very, um... gentle man.
Very interesting.

45:09.500 --> 45:11.730
I'd love to. I've never seen wood carvings.

45:11.860 --> 45:15.409
Well, I mean African heads,
and we picked them up in, uh...

45:15.940 --> 45:17.578
- <i>(George)</i> Bimini.
- Bimini.

45:17.700 --> 45:21.136
We got them for a steal. You won't
believe the price we paid for them.

45:21.260 --> 45:24.457
You want wood carvings?
I'll show you wood carvings. Tell her.

45:24.580 --> 45:27.299
You simply must see these.
They're absolutely...

45:43.300 --> 45:45.256
<i>(George coughs)</i>

45:55.060 --> 45:57.016
- <i>George!</i>
- Yes, dear?

45:57.140 --> 45:59.449
<i>They're on the top shelf in the closet.</i>

45:59.580 --> 46:01.775
The closet or the bureau?

46:01.900 --> 46:03.856
<i>Top shelf in the closet.</i>

46:03.980 --> 46:05.936
Top shelf? Right.

46:10.940 --> 46:12.896
<i>(humming)</i>

46:37.980 --> 46:41.939
You know, Bimini is a free port
and we got a marvellous buy on them.

46:47.060 --> 46:49.016
- From Bimini. The Bahamas?
- Oh?

46:49.140 --> 46:51.096
- Beautiful, hm?
- Uh... yes.

46:51.220 --> 46:53.097
- Look at that detail.
- They're...

46:53.220 --> 46:55.131
I'd like your husband to see these.

46:55.260 --> 46:56.773
Thief! Purse-snatcher!

46:58.380 --> 47:01.258
Thief! Help! Help! Get him!

47:06.220 --> 47:10.736
<i>(high-pitched voice)</i> Let it go! Don't call
the police! Oh, my God! The police!

47:11.740 --> 47:15.574
You know, I'm wondering, uh...
what could be taking Sam so long?

47:15.700 --> 47:19.136
- Would you excuse me for a second?
- Certainly.

47:19.260 --> 47:23.617
- Are you all right, lady?
- It's just another crime in the street thing.

47:23.740 --> 47:27.255
It's... an everyday happening.
It just happened to me. It's...

47:27.380 --> 47:30.690
- You're really lucky.
- Lucky?! Well, I don't know...

47:30.820 --> 47:34.051
- Oh! I coulda been dead!
- Right. You're absolutely right.

47:34.180 --> 47:37.570
- Did you have any valuables in it?
- No, I don't think so.

47:37.700 --> 47:40.134
- You're probably wondering why...
- Yes.

47:40.260 --> 47:44.378
I got a cold. It's dripping.
I don't feel good altogether, you know...

47:44.500 --> 47:48.015
- Oh, these young people today!
- What can you do? What can you do?

47:48.140 --> 47:52.213
It's the society we're living in.
What I... But don't make a fuss.

47:52.340 --> 47:54.979
<i>(knocks)</i> Sam, what did you do? Fall in?

48:00.260 --> 48:02.216
Are you sure you're all right?

48:02.340 --> 48:04.490
Officer, there was a bag stolen.
He got away.

48:04.620 --> 48:07.498
All right! Who's the lady
whose purse was snatched?

48:07.620 --> 48:11.169
It's perfectly OK, officer.
I forgive the little rascal.

48:11.300 --> 48:13.609
I'm sorry, but I'll have to fill out a report.

48:13.740 --> 48:16.618
I don't wanna press charges.
Really, you silly...

48:16.740 --> 48:18.696
<i>(siren)</i>

48:23.740 --> 48:27.130
- What's all the excitement about?
- There's a crowd. And police!

48:27.260 --> 48:29.216
- Police?
- <i>(Julie)</i> Exciting!

48:29.340 --> 48:33.094
- You got me, too. I follow fire engines.
- <i>(Julie)</i> Let's look.

48:33.740 --> 48:35.696
Do you need some money?

48:35.820 --> 48:39.096
<i>(woman)</i> I don't need any money.
It was her purse that was stolen!

48:39.220 --> 48:41.176
Somebody oughta give her some.

48:42.340 --> 48:44.979
- Name?
- Uh... name? I...

48:45.100 --> 48:46.249
Jasmine.

48:46.380 --> 48:48.291
Jasmine Glit.

48:48.420 --> 48:52.095
- Oh, that's a very unusual name.
- Oh, you're sweet!

48:52.220 --> 48:56.008
- What seems to be the trouble, officer?
- It's just a purse-snatching.

48:56.140 --> 48:57.732
Purse...

48:57.860 --> 49:00.420
Oh! L-I'm sorry, lady.
I'm very sorry for you.

49:00.540 --> 49:02.496
- If I lose my baby, I...
- Baby?

49:02.620 --> 49:03.939
- Yes.
- Come in and lie down.

49:04.060 --> 49:06.290
- I'm three months pregnant.
- I'm sorry.

49:06.420 --> 49:09.093
My gynaecologist told me
to avoid excitement.

49:11.820 --> 49:14.129
- Please come inside and let me...
- Nah...

49:14.260 --> 49:15.579
<i>(woman screams)</i>

49:15.700 --> 49:18.658
My God! She's my husband!

49:18.780 --> 49:20.736
Sam... Sam Le...

49:20.860 --> 49:22.816
Yes! Sam Letterman!

49:22.940 --> 49:25.170
I'm a man! I'm a man. Here. See?

49:25.300 --> 49:27.052
Pull! Pull! Look.

49:27.180 --> 49:29.136
Sylvia! Zip me down.

49:29.260 --> 49:30.978
<i>(Sam)</i> Look at this.

49:31.100 --> 49:33.056
Look at this. Look. Huh?

49:33.180 --> 49:35.136
Huh?! Look at this.

49:35.260 --> 49:38.252
- <i>(outraged screams)</i>
- Help me get this stuff off.

49:38.380 --> 49:40.655
Here! Take a look at that!

49:40.780 --> 49:43.613
<i>(Tess)</i> Sam, you should have
told me, that's all.

49:43.740 --> 49:45.696
I would have understood.

49:45.820 --> 49:48.971
It's not the kind of thing
that's easy to talk about.

49:49.100 --> 49:51.739
Sam... we've been married for years.

49:52.620 --> 49:54.690
I love you. You love me.

49:55.700 --> 49:57.975
You could have come to me and said...

49:58.100 --> 50:01.376
..."Tess... I have a diseased mind."

50:02.300 --> 50:04.256
"I'm a sick individual."

50:04.380 --> 50:06.336
"I need help."

50:06.460 --> 50:08.735
"I need treatment. I'm perverted."

50:09.820 --> 50:13.051
"I'm unfit to function
with normal, decent people."

50:14.180 --> 50:16.136
I would have understood.

50:16.260 --> 50:18.216
Thank you. Tess?

50:19.060 --> 50:22.132
- I'm going to see Dr Fillmore next week.
- I'm glad.

50:22.260 --> 50:24.216
You're wonderful.

50:28.500 --> 50:32.573
The look on their faces
when the police removed your hat!

50:32.700 --> 50:34.053
Ha-ha!

50:41.700 --> 50:45.295
<i>Brought to you by Lancer,</i>
<i>the hair conditioner for men.</i>

50:45.420 --> 50:48.093
Are you still using
that same old stuff on your hair?

50:48.220 --> 50:49.778
Yeah. Why?

50:49.900 --> 50:51.856
Try this.

50:53.060 --> 50:55.016
- Lancer. Really?
- Go ahead.

50:58.660 --> 51:00.491
Hey, this is great. No grease or oil!

51:00.620 --> 51:03.009
Right. Grooms and conditions
at the same time.

51:03.140 --> 51:05.096
Smells great, too.

51:06.020 --> 51:09.012
Lancer. The conditioner
that grooms and conditions.

51:11.780 --> 51:13.736
Good!

51:16.980 --> 51:19.289
<i>Lancer - for that better-groomed look.</i>

51:19.420 --> 51:21.376
<i>A product of K Pharmaceuticals.</i>

51:28.260 --> 51:30.535
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

51:30.660 --> 51:33.379
Welcome once again
to <i>What's My Perversion?</i>

51:33.500 --> 51:35.491
Panel members, you look splendid.

51:35.620 --> 51:39.772
Pamela and Toni, so beautiful.
And Regis and Robert Q, so handsome.

51:39.900 --> 51:41.970
And, panel members, we have...

51:42.100 --> 51:45.854
...some <i>very</i> interesting guests
this evening. Let's get right to them.

51:45.980 --> 51:47.095
So...

51:47.220 --> 51:49.893
First guest, will you sign in, please?

51:56.540 --> 51:58.496
<i>(Jack)</i> Bernard...

51:59.260 --> 52:01.216
...Jaffe.
- <i>(applause)</i>

52:04.500 --> 52:06.536
Mr Jaffe, would you sit down, sir?

52:06.660 --> 52:10.016
A pleasure to have you with us,
here on <i>What's My Perversion?</i>

52:10.140 --> 52:12.529
- You know the rules of our game.
- Yes, I do.

52:12.660 --> 52:15.697
You get $5 every time the panel
comes up with a "no" answer.

52:15.820 --> 52:17.776
To start our game going...

52:17.900 --> 52:20.778
...would you whisper in my ear
what your perversion is?

52:20.900 --> 52:24.449
While you do that, we will let the studio
and the home audience know...

52:24.580 --> 52:26.775
...exactly <i>what</i> your perversion is.

52:31.340 --> 52:33.296
Good. All right, panel members.

52:33.420 --> 52:36.890
The studio and the home audience
know what his perversion is.

52:37.020 --> 52:39.693
- We'll start with Robert Q Lewis.
- Thank you, Jack.

52:39.820 --> 52:42.539
Mr Jaffe, is this one of
those <i>nice</i> perversions...

52:42.660 --> 52:44.696
...that <i>any</i> guy might indulge in?

52:44.820 --> 52:46.776
<i>(Jaffe)</i> Anybody can do it.

52:46.900 --> 52:49.778
I'm sure you could.
It's just a matter of wanting to.

52:49.900 --> 52:52.494
I see. Thank you. Is this
one of the perversions...

52:52.620 --> 52:55.578
...that might best be...
performed in the home...

52:55.700 --> 52:58.817
...or could you just do it anywhere?
- <i>(Jack)</i> Not necessarily.

52:58.940 --> 53:01.977
I think that will get a "no" answer.
And $5 to you, Mr Jaffe.

53:02.100 --> 53:05.456
And we turn the questioning
over to Pamela Mason. Pamela?

53:05.580 --> 53:08.572
Is it something that is, uh...
done with the hands?

53:08.700 --> 53:10.656
- Do you want to help me on that?
- Yes.

53:10.780 --> 53:14.819
I would think that would not necessarily
have to play a part in the procedure.

53:14.940 --> 53:18.376
And we give you a "no" answer on that.
That's $10 for you, Mr Jaffe.

53:18.500 --> 53:20.456
And Regis Philbin is up next.

53:20.580 --> 53:22.730
When you're doing your perversion...

53:22.860 --> 53:25.693
...do you have any need for... for props?

53:25.820 --> 53:27.048
Props?

53:27.180 --> 53:29.250
You know, uh... whips or leather boots?

53:29.380 --> 53:32.531
- Oh, no!
- No, no. That's definitely not necessary.

53:32.660 --> 53:36.289
- $15, Regis Philbin. And now Toni Holt.
- Mr Jaffe...

53:36.420 --> 53:41.369
...would a telescope or a pair of binoculars
be helpful to you at any time?

53:41.500 --> 53:44.810
It would have to be...
pointed in the right direction.

53:44.940 --> 53:48.376
- <i>(audience laughter)</i>
- I would have to interject to say that...

53:48.500 --> 53:51.458
...it would not be helpful to <i>you,</i>
but to somebody else.

53:51.580 --> 53:55.539
In that respect, I think we must give you
a "no" answer, Toni. Robert Q Lewis.

53:55.660 --> 53:57.696
Are you... I'll take a wild guess.

53:57.820 --> 54:00.254
Are you... a rapist?

54:01.220 --> 54:03.176
- Hardly.
- No. No, not at all.

54:03.300 --> 54:06.258
$25. And... Pamela Mason.

54:06.380 --> 54:09.338
- I'll pass to Regis.
- Is it self-contained?

54:11.300 --> 54:13.575
<i>(Jaffe)</i> Yes. I carry it with me at all times.

54:13.700 --> 54:17.613
- <i>(audience laughter)</i>
- I'm gonna take a guess. I think I have it.

54:18.220 --> 54:20.176
Do you molest children?

54:20.300 --> 54:22.495
<i>(Jack)</i> No, you're all on the wrong track.

54:22.620 --> 54:26.329
Would you tell them what your perversion
is? You already have your $50.

54:26.460 --> 54:29.418
Yes. L-I like to...
to expose myself on subways.

54:29.540 --> 54:31.496
On subways.

54:31.620 --> 54:33.736
<i>(applause)</i>

54:34.940 --> 54:37.090
And now the winner
of this week's contest.

54:37.220 --> 54:40.496
Each week, we give you at home
an opportunity to play our game.

54:40.620 --> 54:43.976
We ask you to write and tell us
exactly what your perversion is.

54:44.100 --> 54:46.409
We select the most interesting letter...

54:46.540 --> 54:51.136
...and we give that contestant a chance
to act out his fantasy on the programme.

54:51.260 --> 54:55.890
I present this week's winner. Ladies and
gentlemen and members of the panel...

54:56.020 --> 55:00.252
...here from Muncie, Indiana
is our winner - Rabbi Chaim Baumel.

55:00.380 --> 55:02.257
<i>(applause)</i>

55:06.300 --> 55:08.939
Well, congratulations to you,
Chaim Baumel.

55:09.060 --> 55:11.016
Uh, excuse me.

55:11.140 --> 55:13.495
It's not <i>Chaim.</i> It's not <i>Caim.</i>

55:14.140 --> 55:17.052
- It's pronounced <i>Chiam.</i>
- Chiam.

55:17.180 --> 55:20.138
Chiam. Very good. I understand,
in addition to being...

55:20.260 --> 55:24.333
...a very distinguished clergyman,
you have a very fascinating fetish.

55:24.460 --> 55:27.691
- Yes... You mean a hang-up.
- Yes.

55:27.820 --> 55:29.173
Yes.

55:29.300 --> 55:31.256
Silk stockings.

55:31.380 --> 55:33.848
- Silk stockings?
- I love silk stockings.

55:33.980 --> 55:36.130
To touch 'em... To hug them...

55:36.260 --> 55:38.137
To... To...

55:38.260 --> 55:41.332
Now, you wrote in your letter
that what you'd like is to be...

55:41.460 --> 55:43.416
...tied up.

55:43.540 --> 55:47.294
For this we need the help of
one of the members of the panel. Uh...

55:47.420 --> 55:50.298
Someone to tie him up.
Regis Philbin, would you?

55:50.420 --> 55:52.376
Excuse me.

55:52.500 --> 55:54.456
- Must be a girl.
- A girl.

55:54.580 --> 55:57.617
Well, we certainly have
two lovely girls. Pamela...

55:57.740 --> 56:01.096
...will you do the honours and tie him up?
- Love to!

56:01.220 --> 56:03.176
<i>(Jack)</i> Rabbi.

56:06.620 --> 56:09.259
Now, Pamela is going to
tie Rabbi Baumel...

56:09.380 --> 56:12.690
...according to the wishes
as expressed in his letter.

56:12.820 --> 56:17.018
I haven't had a lot of experience, Rabbi,
but... I think I can manage.

56:17.140 --> 56:20.450
If you have any special instructions,
please let me know.

56:20.580 --> 56:23.890
Is there any special area
that you'd like to have tied?

56:24.020 --> 56:25.976
Not too tight! <i>(chuckles)</i>

56:26.100 --> 56:27.818
- There.
- Good!

56:27.940 --> 56:31.171
<i>(Jack)</i> And now a model from
the Lucy Jones Modelling Agency...

56:31.300 --> 56:35.009
...is going to pretend that
she is Rabbi Baumel's governess...

56:35.140 --> 56:37.415
...and she is going to spank the rabbi.

56:40.020 --> 56:41.976
You've been a naughty rabbi!

56:42.100 --> 56:45.854
- <i>(Jack)</i> While at the same time...
- I have to be in the synagogue tomorrow.

56:45.980 --> 56:50.132
...Mrs Baumel, the rabbi's wife,
who we've flown in from Indiana...

56:50.260 --> 56:52.296
...will sit at the rabbi's feet...

56:52.420 --> 56:54.376
...and eat pork.

56:55.180 --> 56:57.136
Take that! Naughty rabbi!

56:57.260 --> 56:59.216
Now, don't you do that again!

57:00.300 --> 57:02.256
<i>(model)</i> You're bad!

57:02.380 --> 57:04.689
Naughty, naughty... <i>(giggles)</i>

57:04.820 --> 57:09.940
<i>(Jack)</i> Well, there it is, America. Another
lucky winner gets to act out his fantasy.

57:10.060 --> 57:14.338
This is Jack Barry, saying goodbye
and good luck from me and the panel.

57:14.460 --> 57:18.169
We'll see you next week on...
<i>What's My Perversion?</i>

57:19.380 --> 57:21.336
<i>(applause and cheering)</i>

57:51.980 --> 57:54.972
- Uh... Let me have 50¢ worth of regular.
- You bet.

58:04.180 --> 58:07.297
Excuse me. My car broke down
about two miles down the road.

58:07.420 --> 58:09.888
- Could you send somebody to get it?
- Sure, ma'am.

58:10.020 --> 58:11.578
Thank you.

58:11.700 --> 58:13.816
Uh, how far is Dr Bernardo's house?

58:13.940 --> 58:16.329
- Uh... about seven miles.
- Oh, dammit!

58:16.980 --> 58:18.936
- Miss?
- Yes?

58:19.060 --> 58:21.654
- You're going to Dr Bernardo's house?
- Uh-huh.

58:21.780 --> 58:25.250
- Would you like a lift? I'm going there.
- Oh... Gee, that'd be swell.

58:25.380 --> 58:27.336
- Yeah? Oh, well, come on.
- OK.

58:30.580 --> 58:32.616
Are you a friend of Dr Bernardo's?

58:32.740 --> 58:37.256
Not exactly. I'm gonna be working
with him, helping with his experiments.

58:37.380 --> 58:39.894
Are you studying sexual phenomena, too?

58:40.020 --> 58:42.978
Yes. I, uh... was a biology major in school.

58:43.100 --> 58:47.935
I'm really looking forward to working with
the doctor. He's a great hero of mine.

58:48.060 --> 58:52.736
He was the first man to ever measure the
sound waves produced by an erection.

58:52.860 --> 58:55.420
- Yes, I know.
- Do you?

58:55.540 --> 58:57.576
Yes, I'm a reporter for <i>The Globe.</i>

58:57.700 --> 59:02.012
I'm going to interview Dr Bernardo
for a story in our Sunday supplement.

59:02.140 --> 59:04.096
- A reporter, huh?
- Mm-hm.

59:04.220 --> 59:06.176
You know, you're kinda cute.

59:06.300 --> 59:08.530
Why don't you just watch the road, huh?

59:08.660 --> 59:10.093
What's your name?

59:10.220 --> 59:12.688
Helen Lacey. What's yours?

59:12.820 --> 59:13.969
Victor.

59:14.100 --> 59:16.056
Victor Shackelpopolous.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.937
<i>(mumbling)</i>

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.856
Is... Is Dr Bernardo here?

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.056
I think he wants us to come in.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.815
The doctor is expecting us, so, uh...

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.856
Look at this place!

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.699
It's really great.
Is your decorator still living?

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.538
It's chilly!

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.696
Uh... So... So, what d'you think?

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.175
Is... Is Dr Bernardo here or... what?

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.256
I am Dr Bernardo.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.536
You must be Victor.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.537
And Miss Lacey.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.413
Igor!

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:51.929
I thought I told you
to keep to your room.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.856
<i>(mumbling)</i>

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.696
Forgive him.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.776
He usually keeps to his room.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:07.051
I know there's a big problem
with domestics nowadays.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.136
Come.

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.216
Shall we have dinner?

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.296
<i>(whispers)</i> Yeah.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.298
I understand you're famous
for your potato pancakes.

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:19.253
Dr Bernardo, you don't know
how excited I am to be here.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.336
I've waited so long to meet you!

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.770
I'm really looking forward to
helping you with your experiments.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.856
Have you read my latest book...

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.972
<i>... Advanced Sexual Positions:</i>
<i>How To Achieve Them Without Laughing?</i>

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:32.056
It's getting to be a classic.

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.136
I'm familiar with it.

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.569
It's wonderful how you men of science...

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.611
...have finally gotten around to sex.

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:42.892
The girls at <i>The Globe</i> are so pleased with
your work on respiration during orgasm.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.170
A mere trifle compared to my real work.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.495
Doctor, I read a statement you made.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:51.738
You felt the average length
of a man's penis should be 19 inches.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.816
Doesn't that seem a little long?

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.219
Long?!

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:59.332
My friend, I'm making discoveries
you wouldn't dream of!

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.850
Yes, I know. But... But 19 inches...
I mean, that's...

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.857
<i>(doctor)</i> Does that sound mad?!

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:09.132
That's what they called me at
Masters' and Johnson's clinic. Mad!

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.820
Because I had visions of explorations...

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:15.376
...in sexual areas undreamed of
by lesser human beings!

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.937
It was I who first discovered how to
make a man impotent by hiding his hat!

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.858
I was the first one
to explain the connection...

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.529
...between excessive masturbation
and entering politics.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.616
It was I who first said...

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:31.618
...that clitoral orgasm
should not be only for women.

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.493
They laughed at me,
ridiculed me, said I was mad!

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.611
Ha-ha! But I showed them!

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.413
Ha-ha! They threw me out
of Masters' and Johnson's.

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.496
No severance pay. And I had it coming!

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.611
But I showed them! <i>(manic laugh)</i>

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.896
Are we having dessert?

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.538
Oh, come. I want to show you
my laboratory.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.496
Igor!

01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.975
<i>(mumbling)</i>

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.170
Clean up this table, and hurry!

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.256
<i>(mumbling)</i>

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.736
You must forgive Igor.

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:10.011
He was part of an experiment
of mine that backfired.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:14.179
Using an electrical generator,
I gave him a four-hour orgasm.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.258
He had fun, but he turned out like this.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.256
Well...

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:25.136
Posture. Posture!

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:33.336
Here it is. Here's where
I'm discovering new facts about sex.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.980
Facts that will make me
a great man one day.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:38.056
<i>(electricity buzzing)</i>

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.016
<i>(machines humming)</i>

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:58.376
Dr Bernardo, what is all this?

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.060
Come this way and you'll see.

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.812
Here I'm studying premature ejaculation
in a hippopotamus.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:16.218
How often does that problem
come up with a hippo?

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:21.332
Here I'm forcing a man to have
intercourse with a large rye bread.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.291
They're getting on famously!

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:27.372
Here... I'm going to take
the brain of a lesbian...

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:31.732
...and put it into the body of a man
who works for the telephone company.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.930
But why?
What good will this do anybody?

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.858
It'll show those fools
who called me mad! Come!

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:42.780
- But, doctor, this is immoral!
- Nonsense.

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.778
The human mind is capable
of many strange things. Look.

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:49.131
Each day for the past year
I feed her nothing but silicone.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.216
She used to be flat-chested.

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.535
Give me another year and watch out!

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.536
You're insane!

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:04.015
That's what they said
at Masters and Johnson.

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.859
And all because I built a 400ft diaphragm!

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.139
Birth control for an entire nation at once!

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:19.253
You! You will be the subject
of my newest experiment.

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:23.809
- Me?!
- Yes. Look here.

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:28.091
- <i>(moaning)</i>
- In here I have 20 Scouts.

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:32.648
I want to measure your respiration
when they gangbang you.

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:35.738
- No!
- <i>(moaning)</i>

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:41.338
Get away from her.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:44.975
- Why don't you let her relax and enjoy it?
- You shoot her...

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.977
...and I'll sue you for malpractice!

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.056
Igor!

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:54.130
Victor! Victor, do something!

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.216
Helen, keep your legs crossed.

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.729
Victor!

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.412
<i>(machine buzzes)</i>

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.733
Igor!

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.296
Now we owe them a dinner!

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.376
<i>(engine doesn't start)</i>

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.256
What's wrong, Victor?

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:23.134
I think the battery's dead
and we're out of gas, oil and water.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.375
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.252
- <i>(explosion)</i>
- Agh!

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.940
- What was that?
- That sounded like Igor.

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.573
Victor! Look!

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.932
Oh, my God!

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:43.812
A gigantic tit!

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:46.135
<i>(bubbling)</i>

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.091
Oh, Victor, what are we gonna do?

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.496
I don't know about you, but I'm
going home to get my catcher's mitt.

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:54.214
<i>(Victor)</i> It looks angry. The nipple's erect.

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:58.652
- Oh, Victor! Come on, let's go.
- No! They were all boys in my family.

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:04.976
Oh...

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.376
<i>(typewriter)</i>

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.609
Sheriff, I wanna report an escaped tit!

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:20.095
- A what?!
- It's already killed two people!

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.176
Dr Bernardo and his assistant.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:25.019
- A tremendous tit.
- Have you been drinking?

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.495
Listen, we don't have time to argue here.

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.578
The countryside's being ravaged
by a colossal boob!

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.656
<i>(woman giggles)</i>

01:08:32.779 --> 01:08:34.259
Mmm!

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:38.009
- You've got the most beautiful breasts.
- <i>(interference on car radio)</i>

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.095
Oh, shit!

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:42.688
There's something wrong with the radio.

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:45.618
There's something wrong
with the radio. See?

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:48.015
<i>(bubbling)</i>

01:08:48.899 --> 01:08:50.856
<i>(man)</i> Oh, my God!

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.298
Jesus Christ!

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:55.376
God!

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:58.457
- What is it?!
- Relax! Just relax!

01:09:09.819 --> 01:09:13.176
Be on the lookout
for a large, female breast.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.256
It's about a 4,000 with an X cup.

01:09:15.979 --> 01:09:17.935
About a 4,000 with an X cup.

01:09:18.939 --> 01:09:21.010
Let's go.

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.095
<i>(bubbling)</i>

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.416
We're too late. He's dead.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.100
The cream slowed him up
and the milk killed him.

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:40.814
We're up against a very clever tit.
It shoots half and half.

01:09:40.939 --> 01:09:44.250
Victor, what are we gonna do
to stop this fiendish tit?

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:48.055
I got an idea, but I'd have to
get my hands on some camouflage.

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.136
I can get you camouflage.

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:52.410
Victor, don't do anything dangerous.

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:55.008
Don't worry. I know how to handle tits.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.856
<i>(bubbling)</i>

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.295
Victor! I'm so proud of you. You did it!

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:07.730
Oh, I was so worried. Were you scared?

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:11.569
- Do I look like a guy who gets scared?
- I thought you'd be nursed to death.

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.419
Everything's all secure now.
You don't have to worry.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:18.499
One thing bothers me, though. That's
a single. You're sure that was a single?

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:21.532
- That was a single.
- They usually travel in pairs.

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:24.732
- No, you don't have to worry.
- I've never seen one by itself.

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.816
Two, yes. But not just one.

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:30.535
So we're gonna take a nipple print,
just so we'll have ID on this one.

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:34.209
I think we'll put it on probation
for maybe... 90 days...

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:36.774
...and then take it down to the orphanage.

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.255
There's a lot of hungry babies down there.

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:41.575
You both take care of yourselves now.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.896
<i>(Helen)</i> You were
so magnificent out there.

01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:47.976
I knew then that I wanted you.

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.614
I don't wanna say anything
about this, Helen.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:53.777
L-I kinda had a personal stake
in this case, you know.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.777
I've never told anyone this...

01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:59.495
...but when I was a little child,
I was breast-fed from falsies.

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:03.408
I've learned one thing from
this whole situation, and that is:

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.499
...when it comes to sex, there are certain
things that should be left unknown.

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.009
And with my luck, they probably will be.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.456
<i>(phone rings)</i>

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.138
Brain room.

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.376
Come in, motor function 12. Check.

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.412
His leg itches.

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:47.338
- Scratch the, uh... left leg.
- The leg has been scratched.

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.736
There's a joke coming in on 4-1.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:54.250
- Prepare response for incoming joke.
- Joke response 18.2.

01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.530
- Smile, please.
- He's smiling!

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.139
Brain to stomach.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.330
Stomach to brain. Over.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.178
- Food coming down.
- What kind?

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:05.098
- Fettucine.
- Jesus Christ!

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:08.018
- Italian food coming down!
- <i>(man)</i> Again?!

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.370
Italian food?!

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:16.057
Stomach proceeding with breakdown.

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:20.571
This is Mission Control. Mission Control.
Please stand by for systems check.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.816
Well... what do you think?

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.896
No, thanks.

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.012
- Think we'll have intercourse?
- I'm <i>very</i> optimistic.

01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.370
The date is beautiful. Have you seen her?

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.810
No. I haven't had a chance.
It's been so damned hectic up here.

01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:36.215
She's lovely. You should take a look.

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:41.855
- Brain to eyes. Brain to eyes. Come in.
- Eyes to brain. Over.

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.540
<i>Focus on the dinner date.</i>
<i>I want to check her out.</i>

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:46.810
- Do you want the whole body?
- <i>Yes, please.</i>

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.896
Take a look.

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:52.895
Hey!

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.818
- <i>(man #2) lt'd be a shame to lose her.</i>
- <i>(man #1) And how!</i>

01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:57.532
<i>Wow!</i>

01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.616
<i>Any indication yet?</i>

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:03.415
Brain to ears. Brain to ears.
Can you throw some voice up here?

01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:09.977
Yes. For me, Norman Mailer has
exactly that... same sort of relevance.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.251
That... affirmative, negative duality...

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:16.452
<i>... that only Proust or...</i>
<i>Flaubert could achieve.</i>

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:19.617
I don't know if we're gonna make it.
Doesn't look too good.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:22.300
I'm a graduate of New York University.

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:23.899
We're gonna make it.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.339
<i>(man #2) I'm worried.</i>

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.416
About a possible failure, huh?

01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.609
Yes.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.970
Anyone can have a fiasco now and then...

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:34.729
...but a few in a row can lead to
a serious loss of confidence.

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:38.057
You can see what it's doing
to morale around here already.

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:41.092
Don't worry. We're gonna bring this off.

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:44.530
My place or your place? To me,
it doesn't matter where we do it.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.616
Hey! Why do you look so scared?

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:49.857
Goddammit! Who flashed
the scared expression?! C'mon!

01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:52.096
Anybody press "frightened"?

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:54.415
No one! Must be
a short circuit somewhere.

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:56.098
That's all we need now!

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.972
<i>(bleeping)</i>

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.409
Mission Control! Prepare for launching!

01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:03.612
Prepare for launching!
It looks like they're gonna do it!

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.053
<i>Attention, sperm!</i>
<i>Attention, sperm! Stand by.</i>

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:11.334
- Well... here we go again.
- D'you think we'll get out this time?

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.416
I hope it's not another false alarm.

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:15.735
Been having trouble in Engineering.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:17.976
Yeah, but I heard it was all mental.

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.056
Hey, you're... you're on my tail.

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.408
Sorry.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.850
Heart factors are all balanced.
We could use more adrenaline.

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:27.813
This is the adrenal gland.
We're pumping away here.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.135
Oh, my God, Sydney! Can't you wait?

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.774
You wanna do it right here
in the parking lot?

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.050
Signal the voice to answer yes!

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:38.092
All systems on the alert!
We're gonna try to ball her in the car.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.889
Ears! Quickly! Ears!

01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.410
I've made it in cars before,
but always in hardtops.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:51.215
- Prepare for launching.
- Sexual organs, proceed with erection.

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:54.332
- <i>(man #1)</i> It's stuck!
- <i>(man #2)</i> Let's go, boys!

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:56.416
Come on, get it up, fellas!

01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.929
Pull! All together...

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:03.978
Roll out the tongue.

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.416
Here comes the kiss! Hang on!

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:13.176
<i>(rumbling)</i>

01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.616
Activate pleasure centre!

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:22.177
<i>(ecstatic moaning)</i>

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.768
Can we have an erection?
What the hell's going on?!

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.291
I know you can do it, boys! Pull!

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.611
Come on, fellas! What's the matter?
Don't just stand there!

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.696
What's the matter, Sydney?

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:40.169
- Maintain hands on breasts.
- We're having trouble with respiration.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:42.416
We're <i>way</i> over the limit down here.

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:45.338
If you're not getting an erection,
something's wrong.

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.576
Proceed with erection. All systems go.

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.168
Let's go, boys! All together!

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.892
We gotta get it up!

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:54.136
What the hell's going on down here?

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.852
We need an erection.

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:58.255
We need more help from the brain room.

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.894
Maybe there's some trouble
in the stomach.

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.136
Fettucine is moving along nicely.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:07.212
A couple of injuries from
the veal scallopini, though.

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:09.615
I'm not laughing, Sydney, honestly!

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:13.490
Now kiss me.

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:16.339
We have an erection of 45 degrees.

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:20.453
- Shall we attempt penetration?
- Prepare for penetration.

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:26.728
- Well, this looks like it.
- Do you know what it's like out there?

01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:29.658
It's like they told us
in training school. It's an ovum.

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.055
I'm scared. I don't wanna go.

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.899
This is what all this training was for.

01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.454
Who <i>knows</i> what
it's gonna be like out there?

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.536
You saw slides in class.

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:43.135
Yeah, but... you hear
these strange stories.

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.820
Like, there's this pill these women take.

01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:49.649
Or sometimes the guys slam their heads
up against a wall of hard rubber.

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:51.736
<i>(sperm #1)</i> Oh, that's nonsense.

01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.011
Yeah, or... or what if
it's a homosexual encounter?

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.700
<i>(sperm #2)</i> This is no time
to doubt our mission.

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:02.689
You took an oath when you went to sperm
school. To fertilise an ovum, or die trying.

01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:05.334
No, I'm scared. I don't wanna go out there.

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:08.372
We're too low to attempt penetration.
The men can't hold!

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.092
We <i>gotta</i> hold!

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:12.176
We need more stimulation.

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:15.258
Organ room to brain control.
Re-stimulate pleasure centre.

01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:18.611
- Prepare to stroke her thighs.
- We're on the thighs and stroking.

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:22.619
Attention, mouth. Attention, mouth.
Please blow in her ear.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.174
Erection is at 45 degrees and holding fast.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:28.690
Readjust mouth. We're missing her ear
and blowing into her nose.

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:29.809
Attempt penetration.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:31.453
Thrust!

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:34.492
Ah, it'll never work. The angle's bad.

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:37.930
Hey, we're gonna make babies!

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:53.491
This is Mission Control. Penetrate!

01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:57.693
- We can't. It's no use!
- Hold tight, men! We're losing it.

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.056
What am I doing here?

01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:06.898
What am <i>I doing here?!</i>

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:10.376
It's going down! Keep it up, boys!

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.058
Higher! Pull!

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.136
It's no use! We're losing it!

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:16.330
Start preparing an alibi to save face.

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:20.055
We found him tampering with
the machinery in the cerebral cortex...

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:24.378
...turning up the guilt reflex.
- That's a lie. I never touched anything!

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:27.173
- It's a lie, sir.
- I work in the conscience room.

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:30.417
We found the conscience tied to a chair.
He'd knocked him out.

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:32.974
- Is this true?
- What if it is?

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.660
Don't you think
you should be ashamed of this?!

01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:38.658
Sexual relations
between unmarried people?!

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:40.736
To take an innocent woman...

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:45.331
...and assault her in a brutal,
sadistic, ungodlike manner is...

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.212
...blasphemy!

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:49.296
Lock him up.

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.331
Sabotage is over.

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.416
Blasphemy!

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.735
It's blasphemy!

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:58.249
Full steam ahead.

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:00.450
<i>(pleasured moans)</i>

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:03.249
- Here we go again!
- I'm not going out there.

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.416
I'm not gonna get shot outta that thing!

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:08.293
What if he's masturbating?
I'll wind up on the ceiling!

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.980
- No!
- Get a grip on yourself.

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:13.534
Fellas... Fellas, it's dark out there!

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.298
- Sh! Sh!
- I'm due at my parents' for dinner.

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.376
Heave-ho!

01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:22.896
Heave-ho!

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:26.738
# Mine eyes have seen the glory

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:30.170

<i>(excited gasps)</i>

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.892
# He hath loosed the fateful lightning

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:42.932
# Of his terrible swift sword

# <i>His truth is marching on</i>

01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:49.129
Mmm!

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:51.330
We're inside! We're making it!

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.928
<i>(gasps)</i>

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.257
Memory, think of baseball players
to keep sperm from premature launching.

01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:59.336
<i>(melancholy harmonica)</i>

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:14.614
Can't hold out any longer.
Prepare for release of sperm.

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:16.776
Willie Mays. Joe Namath. Mickey Mantle.

01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:23.976
See you guys in the ovary!

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:26.776
Save me an egg!

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.416
Well, at least he's Jewish.

01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:32.696

Listen! Everybody! Everybody! Can I have
your attention? This is Mission Control.

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:04.850
I just wanna congratulate everybody
on a fine job, well done.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.655
I mean that in all sincerity.
It was hectic, but we brought it through!

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.736
<i>(cheering)</i>

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.570
- Well, she was worth it.
- Yes, she was.

01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:16.168
- I'll drink to that.
- <i>(relaxed chatter)</i>

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:19.736
That was great, Sydney.

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.730
Let's do it one more time.

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:27.090
Hey! Everybody stand by!

01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:29.176

Attention, all hands! Attention, all hands!
Stand by! Stand by!

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.971
- Give me a fatigue reading.
- Uh, 4.5.

01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:41.695
Fatigue reading 4.5. Looks good.
We're going for seconds!

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:44.539
