KURT
A year and a half ago,

00:51.623 --> 00:54.124
the New Directions were nothing
but a group of six misfits,

00:54.175 --> 00:55.659
stumbling their way
through a horrific rendition

00:55.710 --> 00:57.211
of "Sit Down,
You're Rocking the Boat."

00:57.295 --> 00:58.795
Now here we are,
at the top

00:58.847 --> 01:00.180
of the show choir heap:
Nationals!

01:00.265 --> 01:03.684
I want to hit up Central
Park, get my frolic on.

01:03.768 --> 01:05.435
I want to throw stuff
off the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:05.503 --> 01:06.603
You guys, hold
on. I mean,

01:06.671 --> 01:07.754
we still have
two songs to write.

01:07.822 --> 01:10.057
Okay, Mr. Bossy Pants.

01:10.141 --> 01:13.861
But I think we might have some
time for a tune before we leave.

Guys, I have news.

01:28.409 --> 01:31.044
To celebrate our impending win
at Nationals,

01:31.129 --> 01:34.464
I got us all 13 tickets
to Broadway's longest-running

01:34.532 --> 01:35.966
show ever,

01:36.033 --> 01:37.033
<i>Cats!</i>

01:37.085 --> 01:38.919
Yeah, you did.

01:39.003 --> 01:40.804
You might want to check the
dates on those tickets, Rachel,

01:40.871 --> 01:42.706
because <i>Cats</i> closed
about 11 years ago.

01:44.092 --> 01:45.275
He did seem crazy.

01:45.343 --> 01:46.677
Charged my credit card

01:46.728 --> 01:48.061
by swiping it through
his butt-crack.

01:48.146 --> 01:49.846
Okay, welcome

01:49.898 --> 01:51.348
to Intercontinental
New York Times Square.

01:51.399 --> 01:53.100
- Your rooms are on the seventh floor.
- Great.

01:53.184 --> 01:55.485
You planning on fitting all
those kids in two rooms?

01:55.553 --> 01:57.070
Yeah, well,
it's all we can afford.

01:57.138 --> 01:58.322
I was just thinking about splitting

01:58.389 --> 01:59.131
them up, boys and girls.

01:59.132 --> 02:00.554
You guys in for the show
choir competition?

02:00.579 --> 02:01.779
Yeah. Why?

02:02.076 --> 02:04.695
Most of the other teams
split by sexual orientation.

02:04.746 --> 02:07.197
Oh. Did you know that
New York City was built

02:07.248 --> 02:09.166
right on top of
Old York City?

02:09.233 --> 02:10.701
I'm pretty sure
that's not true.

02:10.752 --> 02:12.920
Oh, I'm
just pretty.

02:13.004 --> 02:14.421
Hi.
Hi.

02:14.505 --> 02:16.740
I'm surprised at how well
Quinn is taking the breakup.

02:16.791 --> 02:19.242
I guess I was wrong about her
being a vindictive harpy.

02:19.294 --> 02:20.928
I guess she just accepted
the inevitable.

02:21.012 --> 02:22.262
Or maybe she's
just distracted

02:22.347 --> 02:24.247
by the awesomeness of
New York. I know I am.

02:24.299 --> 02:27.100
Hey, do you know why it smells
like it's wet here all the time?

02:27.185 --> 02:29.052
No. So, what's going on
with you and Jessie?

02:29.103 --> 02:30.520
I don't know. He
keeps texting me.

02:30.588 --> 02:33.223
But I told him I don't want
to talk till I get back.

02:33.274 --> 02:35.425
No boys, no distractions
until we win that trophy.

02:35.476 --> 02:37.110
Hey, Finn, where the
hell is Puckerman?

02:37.195 --> 02:39.095
Um...

02:41.199 --> 02:43.266
I'll have a Manhattan.

02:43.318 --> 02:45.319
Do you even know
what's <i>in</i> a Manhattan?

02:45.403 --> 02:47.237
Yeah, me,
for the first time.

02:47.288 --> 02:49.539
Which is why I want
to celebrate with a cocktail.

02:51.209 --> 02:53.610
Guys, group meeting,
in the room now.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.768
Do you know that I can get
ahi tartare and a steak

03:01.836 --> 03:03.403
sandwich at 3:00
in the morning

03:03.471 --> 03:04.638
from their all-night
dining menu?

03:04.722 --> 03:06.590
I feel like Eloise.
I have pills for that.

03:06.641 --> 03:08.458
All right, guys,
this is your time.

03:08.509 --> 03:10.644
Now, you are all on lockdown

03:10.728 --> 03:12.596
till you finish writing
our songs for Nationals.

03:12.647 --> 03:14.964
I want at least two solid verses
by the time I get back.

03:15.016 --> 03:16.149
Aren't you going to help us?

03:16.234 --> 03:18.301
Uh, um... I will be back

03:18.353 --> 03:21.021
and read your amazing creations
and give notes, but right now,

03:21.105 --> 03:24.491
I have to head to the theater

04:40.935 --> 04:42.652
We got to get out of here.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.522
Wait. No, no, no. Mr. Shue gave
us explicit instructions...

04:45.573 --> 04:47.557
To write a song,
and our problem is,

04:47.608 --> 04:50.444
is that our only inspiration are
mattresses and bathroom cups.

04:50.528 --> 04:52.696
Quinn's right. We're in the
artists capital of the world.

04:52.747 --> 04:54.898

actors, playwrights.

has passed through this city.

not stuck in here.

Guys, I don't think
this is a good idea.

05:02.373 --> 05:03.924

those songs to write.

05:04.008 --> 05:05.509
If we don't write them,
we're going to lose.

05:05.576 --> 05:07.010
No. They're right.

05:07.077 --> 05:09.245
Can't you hear the city
calling to you?

05:09.297 --> 05:11.965
We don't need to write songs
for Nationals.

awful dates

08:12.364 --> 08:13.764

unwatchable romantic comedies

08:13.816 --> 08:15.049

10:22.611 --> 10:25.246
Oh. Sorry I was just trying out
a new idea for the show.

10:25.330 --> 10:27.415
I've been working here 25 years.

10:27.499 --> 10:29.383
Seen a lot of talent
come and go.

10:29.451 --> 10:31.068
And let me tell you
something, kid.

10:31.119 --> 10:32.570
You got it.

10:52.457 --> 10:53.641
Hi.

10:53.725 --> 10:54.925
Hi.

10:54.977 --> 10:56.460
What's so important?

10:56.528 --> 10:59.864
Uh, these are for you.

10:59.931 --> 11:02.133
I thought since, uh,
we're both captains and all,

11:02.200 --> 11:04.285
we should write a duet
for Nationals.

11:04.369 --> 11:07.755
The tie and... flowers,
Central Park?

11:07.823 --> 11:10.224
Oh, it's a... a work date.

11:10.292 --> 11:13.411
Uh, totally professional.

11:13.462 --> 11:15.329
Oh, my God, I can't
believe we're at Sardi's.

11:15.414 --> 11:16.664
Sardi's! The birthplace
of the Tony Award.

11:16.748 --> 11:18.833
What's a salad "nicose"?
One day they're gonna

11:18.917 --> 11:20.968
put a cartoon likeness
of me on these walls.

11:21.053 --> 11:22.720
I like the way
you dream so big.

11:22.787 --> 11:26.090
I don't know how to do that.

Oh, my God!

Oh, no, oh, my God,
I can't do this.

11:38.937 --> 11:42.239
No. No, I have to-- I mean,
if not for me, then for Kurt.

11:42.307 --> 11:44.742
I mean, he'd kill me
if I didn't. Okay.

11:44.809 --> 11:47.411
Excuse me, uh,
Miss LuPone?

11:47.479 --> 11:49.196
I have to say
that you're my idol.

11:49.281 --> 11:51.832

in high school.

Rachel Berry.

promise me one thing--

12:06.014 --> 12:07.882
you'll never give up.

Yes, Ms. LuPone, I promise.

23:32.511 --> 23:35.262
You've inspired us in
so many ways, so...

23:35.347 --> 23:36.931
this is just another.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.383
I don't understand.

23:39.434 --> 23:40.601
Who-who told you guys?

23:40.685 --> 23:41.652
Goolsby.

23:44.689 --> 23:45.673
You okay, Mr. Shue?

23:45.741 --> 23:47.775
I'm not going.

23:49.444 --> 23:51.328
I'm staying with you guys.

23:51.396 --> 23:54.415
I had my moment on the stage
and it was glorious.

23:55.484 --> 23:57.284
But you and I...

23:57.352 --> 23:59.754
have some unfinished business
to take care of.

24:01.506 --> 24:03.407
Now get out your notebooks.

24:03.458 --> 24:05.242
Time to get to work.

24:05.293 --> 24:08.179
Come on,
this is Nationals, people.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.717
Yes, Puck.
I want in, I want in.

24:13.769 --> 24:15.136
Oh, gee!

24:23.283 --> 24:24.363
We made it.

24:24.364 --> 24:26.732
We're one of the top 50
show choirs in the nation.

24:26.783 --> 24:28.433
Tomorrow only ten will move on
to Showcase,

24:28.485 --> 24:30.452
where they'll vie
for the National Championship.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.104
We have so got this.

24:32.155 --> 24:33.739
Okay, usually
I'm pretty cautious

24:33.790 --> 24:36.041
about getting your hopes up,
but honestly, guys?

24:36.109 --> 24:38.911
I think we got a really good
shot at winning this thing.

24:38.962 --> 24:41.630
All right, everybody put
your hand in the middle.

24:41.715 --> 24:43.132

a T-shirt to send to all
the teams we beat at Nationals.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.194
Yeah, well,
don't bother getting us one.

25:45.278 --> 25:47.846
I have a sneaking suspicion that
we're about to kick your ass.

25:47.897 --> 25:50.282
You're about to go up against
the top show choirs

25:50.349 --> 25:52.317
in the country
and your team spent all week

25:52.369 --> 25:55.704
mooning about how fun
and exciting New York is.

25:55.789 --> 25:56.872
You're a bag of meat.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.991

You're about a large, right?

25:59.042 --> 25:59.992
Extra large.
What are you doing?

26:00.043 --> 26:02.461
Buying you a T-shirt, Goolsby.

26:02.528 --> 26:04.263

of your brainwashed

26:20.597 --> 26:22.398
Vocal Adrenaline
brothers and sisters?

26:22.482 --> 26:24.767
I'm not throwing up
on purpose.

26:24.834 --> 26:28.320
I'm so nervous
I can't keep any food down.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.389
I used to love singing.

26:30.457 --> 26:32.024
It was the only thing
that relaxed me.

26:32.075 --> 26:33.158
Now I hate it.

26:33.226 --> 26:36.245
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.

26:36.329 --> 26:38.280
I think you're kind of mean,
but I don't think you're stupid.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.581
I know what you're
trying to doing.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.116
You're trying to get me
to feel bad for you

26:41.201 --> 26:42.835
so that I don't try as hard
to crush you on the stage.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.953
What did I ever do to you
to make you hate me so much?

26:45.038 --> 26:48.123
When I came to your school,
I heard that the Glee Club

26:48.208 --> 26:49.591
was where kids went when no one
else would take them.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.210
A safe place.

26:51.261 --> 26:54.763
For some reason, you made me the
only one who wasn't safe there.

26:54.848 --> 26:56.414
Where are you going?

26:56.466 --> 26:59.017
To the Philippine embassy.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.804
I'm going to beg them to revoke
my visa and deport me back home.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.689
That's the only way

27:03.756 --> 27:05.441
I'm going to be able
to escape Vocal Adrenaline.

27:05.525 --> 27:07.142
Wait... wait.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.230
It's because you're good.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.765
That's why I hated you.

27:13.817 --> 27:16.735
That's why I sent you
to that crack house.

27:18.037 --> 27:20.155
I'm sorry.

27:21.791 --> 27:24.493
But you have to go out there
and sing.

27:26.129 --> 27:27.379
You have a gift.

27:27.446 --> 27:30.816
Something that Dustin
Goolsby would kill for.

27:30.884 --> 27:33.385
I can't. I'm going to barf
all over the stage.

27:33.452 --> 27:34.488
If you feel like you're going
to throw up

27:34.513 --> 27:36.012
just look at me,
and I'll help you through it.

27:36.039 --> 27:37.923
Why?

27:37.974 --> 27:39.291
Don't you want to win?

27:40.560 --> 27:42.744
Guys like us
have to stick together.

27:42.812 --> 27:45.564

30:51.290 --> 30:52.807
Who cares about the song?

30:52.875 --> 30:55.209
What I don't understand is,
all you've ever wanted is

30:55.294 --> 30:56.544
for us to
be together,

30:56.628 --> 30:58.413
and I'm basically standing here
begging for you,

30:58.497 --> 30:59.864
and suddenly
you're not interested.

30:59.915 --> 31:00.832
I-I <i>am</i> interested.

31:02.051 --> 31:03.000
More than interested.

31:04.369 --> 31:06.320
This is my dream.

31:06.388 --> 31:09.757
Being here in New York.

31:09.842 --> 31:13.311

31:17.816 --> 31:19.484
I love you.

31:20.869 --> 31:22.403
But...

31:22.488 --> 31:24.655
...there's nothing
you can say or do

31:24.723 --> 31:26.441
that's gonna
change my mind about it.

Don't you think this is gonna
look so hot on Lord Tubbington?

36:42.657 --> 36:44.859
I'm gonna go find it
in an extra large.

36:47.529 --> 36:49.497
I think we were good.

36:49.581 --> 36:51.982
Good? We were amazing.

36:52.034 --> 36:55.202
The kiss was... interesting.

36:55.287 --> 36:57.254
Yeah, I'm-I'm calling it
The Kiss of the Century.

36:57.322 --> 36:58.456
You're wrong, Finn.

36:58.507 --> 36:59.673
That kiss was unprofessional.

36:59.758 --> 37:01.325
It was too personal and intense.

37:01.376 --> 37:03.177
The judges won't like it.
They'll consider it common

37:03.261 --> 37:05.746
and vulgar, and it cost you
Nationals. Hi, Rachel.

37:05.814 --> 37:07.965
You look amazing,
and you sounded great.

37:08.016 --> 37:09.383
Just shouldn't have kissed him.

37:09.468 --> 37:10.684
Why are you
here, Jessie?

37:10.769 --> 37:11.502
For you.

37:11.553 --> 37:13.687
Dude, back off.

37:13.772 --> 37:15.672
You're just jealous.

37:15.724 --> 37:17.007
Jealous of what we have,

37:17.059 --> 37:18.559
and what we shared
with the entire audience,

37:18.643 --> 37:21.445
because it was shared between
two people who love each other.

37:21.513 --> 37:23.697
It was the Superman of kisses.

37:23.782 --> 37:26.317
It-It came with its own cape,
right, Rachel?

37:28.904 --> 37:29.570
What's-What's
happening?

37:31.656 --> 37:33.524
They just posted
the top ten for showcase.

37:33.575 --> 37:35.242
Everybody, gather around!
It's a moment

37:35.327 --> 37:36.994
two years in the making.
Okay, what should we do?

37:37.045 --> 37:38.546
Let's go look at it...
together.

37:38.630 --> 37:40.131
Come on, come on.

37:40.198 --> 37:42.249
Come on, come on.

37:54.679 --> 37:57.064
Oh, I'm too nervous to look.

37:57.149 --> 37:58.682
I'll go.

38:00.652 --> 38:02.820
What did we place?

38:12.414 --> 38:13.447
Well, Mr. Shue?

38:14.666 --> 38:17.084
Say it. What did we rank?

38:18.286 --> 38:20.254
We didn't.

38:24.960 --> 38:28.295
I'm so sorry, you guys.

38:28.380 --> 38:30.764
We aren't in the top ten.

38:39.332 --> 38:41.332
Oh my God,
you should have seen it.

38:41.358 --> 38:43.609
We all looked at the top
ten list for Showcase,

38:43.660 --> 38:45.027
and we all just
went numb.

38:45.112 --> 38:47.113
And then Jessie kept
going on and on

38:47.164 --> 38:48.931
about how Rachel and Finn's
kiss is what cost us Nationals.

38:48.999 --> 38:50.983
While I understand
passion, I do think

38:51.034 --> 38:52.835
that was unprofessional,
but sorry. Keep going.

38:52.920 --> 38:56.756
Okay, then we get back to
the hotel, and Santana loses it.

39:05.182 --> 39:07.350
I mean, and the plane ride
was completely silent.

39:07.434 --> 39:08.968
Like, no one said a word.

39:09.036 --> 39:11.270
We all just sat there
with our faces buried

39:11.338 --> 39:12.722
in our complimentary copies
of <i>SkyMall.</i>

39:12.806 --> 39:15.308
Wait, I don't get it.
You don't seem that sad at all.

39:15.359 --> 39:18.144
Well, it was still amazing.

39:18.195 --> 39:21.781
I mean, I flew on a plane
for the first time in my life,

39:21.848 --> 39:23.149
I had breakfast at Tiffany's,

39:23.200 --> 39:25.902
I sang on a Broadway stage.

39:25.986 --> 39:28.854
I love you.

39:34.695 --> 39:36.528
I love you, too.

39:40.133 --> 39:42.468
You know, when you stop
and think about it,

39:42.535 --> 39:45.087
Kurt Hummel's had
a pretty good year.

39:45.172 --> 39:47.840
Oh, look who's here.

39:47.891 --> 39:49.392
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

39:49.476 --> 39:52.511
Uh, nothing.
Just, uh, getting a coffee.

39:52.563 --> 39:54.480
We ran into each other
in the parking lot.

39:54.547 --> 39:55.982
We're on our way
to get some sheet music.

39:56.049 --> 39:57.716
Tomorrow's my audition for
the summer show at Six Flags.

39:57.768 --> 40:01.654
Whereas I'm spending my summer
composing <i>Pip, Pip, Hooray!</i>

40:01.721 --> 40:03.189
The Broadway music
about Pippa Middleton.

40:03.240 --> 40:05.908
I have no idea who that is,
but it sounds totally awesome.

40:08.662 --> 40:10.863
We'll see you in class.

40:10.914 --> 40:12.564
Bye.
Bye, guys.

40:12.616 --> 40:15.167
Okay, so here are the nominees
for my songs tomorrow.

40:15.235 --> 40:16.419
I think I could
probably...

40:16.503 --> 40:17.954
Do you think
they know?

40:18.038 --> 40:19.755
I don't think
anybody knows.

40:25.429 --> 40:26.929
Hey.

40:27.014 --> 40:28.598
You still pissed?

40:28.682 --> 40:30.082
Do you think this
voodoo doll looks enough

40:30.133 --> 40:31.250
like Rachel Berry
to actually work?

40:31.318 --> 40:33.252
Come on. We can't be mad
at Rachel forever.

40:33.303 --> 40:35.471
Uh, yes, we can.

40:35.555 --> 40:37.607
How could you
possibly be so calm?

40:37.691 --> 40:40.476
I don't know. I hated losing
just as much as everyone,

40:40.560 --> 40:42.862
but this year wasn't
about winning for me.

40:42.929 --> 40:45.231
Clearly, 'cause we
got our asses kicked.

40:45.299 --> 40:47.149
Yeah.

40:47.234 --> 40:49.151
Sorry.

40:49.236 --> 40:51.120
What was it about?

40:51.204 --> 40:53.956
Acceptance.

40:54.041 --> 40:57.994
I know that all the kids
in the glee club-- they fight,

40:58.078 --> 41:00.663
and they steal each other's
boyfriends and girlfriends,

41:00.747 --> 41:04.066
and they threaten to quit,
like, every other week,

41:04.134 --> 41:06.335
but weird stuff like that
happens in families.

41:06.420 --> 41:08.754
Yeah, well, this is a club.
This is not a family.

41:08.805 --> 41:11.007
Okay, well, family is a place

41:11.091 --> 41:13.125
where everyone loves you
no matter what,

41:13.176 --> 41:14.927
and they accept you
for who you are.

41:14.978 --> 41:17.063
I know I'm going to be
a bridesmaid at Mike

41:17.130 --> 41:18.397
and Tina's wedding,
and I'm gonna be

41:18.465 --> 41:19.565
anxiously awaiting,
just like everyone else,

41:19.632 --> 41:21.334
to see if their babies
are Asian, too.

41:21.401 --> 41:23.469
When they find an operation
to make Artie's legs work again,

41:23.520 --> 41:26.105
I'm going to be there
for his first steps.

41:26.156 --> 41:29.025
I love them.
I love everyone in Glee Club.

41:29.109 --> 41:30.809
And I get to spend another year

41:30.861 --> 41:32.478
with everyone I love,
so, I'm good.

41:32.546 --> 41:34.413
What about you and I?

41:34.481 --> 41:36.365
I love you, Santana.

41:36.450 --> 41:37.783
I love you more

41:37.834 --> 41:40.136
than I've ever loved anyone else
in this world.

41:40.203 --> 41:43.372
All I know about you and I
is that, because of that,

41:43.457 --> 41:45.324
I think anything's possible.

41:49.846 --> 41:51.964
You're my best friend.

41:52.015 --> 41:53.516
Yeah, me, too.

42:02.008 --> 42:03.976
When did you
get so smart?

42:10.901 --> 42:12.785
Where have you been?

42:12.852 --> 42:14.070
Hiding out.

42:14.154 --> 42:15.621
Everyone hates me.

42:15.689 --> 42:17.673
No, they don't.
It doesn't explain why

42:17.741 --> 42:20.543
you haven't said a word to me
since we've been back.

42:20.610 --> 42:23.129
'Cause you should be more pissed
at me than anyone else.

42:23.196 --> 42:24.580
I screwed up!

42:24.664 --> 42:26.816
I'm humiliated.
We worked so hard

42:26.883 --> 42:28.217
for everything,

42:28.285 --> 42:30.753
and I was supposed
to be this big shot leader,

42:30.837 --> 42:34.690
holding everyone together,
and... I blew it.

42:34.758 --> 42:36.976
Cost us the
championship.

42:37.043 --> 42:39.228
Look, being an artist

42:39.312 --> 42:41.213
is about expressing
your true feelings,

42:41.264 --> 42:44.049
in the moment,
no matter what the consequences.

42:44.101 --> 42:46.118
What were you feeling
in that moment?

42:46.186 --> 42:48.003
That I loved you.

42:50.424 --> 42:52.925
And that I would have
done or given anything

42:52.993 --> 42:54.860
to kiss you
one more time.

42:54.911 --> 42:57.062
So you did.

42:58.915 --> 43:02.284
You know, you gave it all up
for one kiss.

43:02.369 --> 43:04.787
Yeah.

43:04.855 --> 43:06.756
Was it worth it?

43:07.958 --> 43:09.859
Yeah.

43:09.926 --> 43:11.794
What about you?

43:13.547 --> 43:15.948
Was it worth it for you?

43:17.134 --> 43:18.868
Yeah.

43:20.804 --> 43:22.388
'Cause I know in my heart

43:22.439 --> 43:23.956
we'll have another shot
at Nationals.

43:24.024 --> 43:28.043
You have to know that I...
I'm leaving, Finn.

43:28.111 --> 43:30.780
I'm going to New York,
and I'm never coming back.

43:31.982 --> 43:34.483
Graduation's a year away.

43:34.568 --> 43:36.935
You got any
plans till then?

43:46.913 --> 43:48.831
Okay. Let's go.

43:48.915 --> 43:50.916
Where are we going?

43:50.967 --> 43:52.751
Final Glee Club meeting
of the year.

43:55.788 --> 43:57.473
No other show choir

43:57.557 --> 44:00.226
who finished in 12th place
has ever felt so honored.

44:07.017 --> 44:08.634
Hi.
Hi.

44:08.685 --> 44:10.402
Hi.
Hiya. Come on.

44:10.470 --> 44:12.905
You guys want to see
what 12th place looks like?
