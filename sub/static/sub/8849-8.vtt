02:51.472 --> 02:53.507
IT'S A DREDGE.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.032
THEY'RE CALLED "SWITCHBACKS,"
ALL RIGHT?

04:25.065 --> 04:26.567

06:59.186 --> 07:00.654
THEY'LL HOLD THE PLATFORM

07:03.724 --> 07:05.659

FOR THE EXTRA WEIGHT.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.995
I HAD A LOOK THIS MORNIN',
FIGURE IT'S SOMETHIN' LIKE THIS.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.831

I BARELY GOT THE MANPOWER
FOR THAT.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.768
- OH, I BROUGHT YOU
THE MANPOWER.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.571
- I'M TALKIN'
ABOUT SKILLED LABOR.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.007
- PSALMS?
- MY MEN'LL LEARN.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.043
SOME OF THEM WORKED ON PLOUGHS
AND COTTON GINS WHERE THEY FROM.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.679
- RAILROAD CARS
AIN'T COTTON GINS.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.615
- AND I THINK YOU HEARD HIM.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.950
THEY CAN LEARN.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.820
- I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE IT.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.661
- GET HER IN POSITION.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.730
MAN RIGHT THERE?

07:42.763 --> 07:45.999
THINKS ALL YOU'RE GOOD FOR

07:48.936 --> 07:51.104
YOU GON' PROVE HIM WRONG?

07:59.680 --> 08:02.983
[sighs]

08:03.016 --> 08:06.554
I KNOW WHAT YOU SEE
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.021
- DOUBT THAT.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.561
- THE MAN WHO KILLED ELAM.

08:15.963 --> 08:18.065
BUT THAT WASN'T ELAM.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.638
THE ONE YOU AND ME KNEW,
HE NEVER COME BACK.

08:30.978 --> 08:34.081
THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA
SAY ABOUT IT.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.586
NOW OR EVER.

08:40.988 --> 08:45.826
- I SEE TO IT MY CREW GIVE
VIRGIL NO REASON TO COMPLAIN.

MOUNTIN' THEM WHEELS NOW.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.612

WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO NOW?

09:08.949 --> 09:13.621
I MEAN, WILL YOU GO HOME NOW?

09:13.621 --> 09:16.790
- ST. LOUIS.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.126

09:19.159 --> 09:22.129
- ST. LOUIS.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.632
THAT'S HOME.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.800
BUT I GOT NO ONE THERE.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.936
NO ONE AND NOTHIN'.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.739
- NO, THAT AIN'T TRUE.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.141
YOU CAN READ.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.777
YOU TALK NICE.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.713
YOU GOT A PRETTY FACE.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.352
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A WHORE.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.755
YOU CAN BE SOMETHIN' BETTER.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.660
- YOU DON'T KNOW.

09:54.127 --> 09:59.399
- COULD BE A LOT WORSE,
I KNOW THAT.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.034
BEFORE I WAS WITH ELAM--

10:01.068 --> 10:02.302
- ELAM.

10:07.207 --> 10:11.745
- STAY WITH ME TILL WE FIND
YOU SOMETHIN' TO DO IN CHEYENNE.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.014
WE'LL THINK ON IT TOGETHER.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.130
- MORNIN'.
- MORNIN'.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.899
FOR YOU.

10:37.905 --> 10:41.675
- THEY FOUND HECKARD'S BODY
IN NEBRASKA,

10:41.709 --> 10:43.110
BY THE SIDE OF THE TRACK.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.780
SOMEBODY BASHED HIS HEAD IN.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.682
- YES, SIR.

10:48.716 --> 10:52.419
- WHAT KIND OF A PLACE HAVE WE
FOUND OURSELVES IN, ATWOOD,

10:52.452 --> 10:54.922
WHERE THE LIFE
OF A U.S. MARSHAL

10:54.955 --> 10:58.792
CAN BE SNUFFED OUT
AT THE WHIM OF AN ARROGANT,

10:58.826 --> 11:03.196
POMPOUS, SELF-IMPORTANT TOAD?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.733
- DURANT?

11:08.769 --> 11:12.239
- SHIT FLOWS DOWNSTREAM...

11:12.272 --> 11:15.776
FROM THE HEADWATERS.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.081
[man whistles]

11:21.114 --> 11:23.751
[indistinct shouts]

11:31.091 --> 11:32.893
- NAOMI?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.831
WHOA.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.038
GO ON.
[clicks tongue]

13:06.186 --> 13:08.088
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

13:08.121 --> 13:10.357
- TELL FATHER HATCH
HIS DAUGHTER'S AT THE GATE!

13:10.390 --> 13:12.960
- BROTHER HATCH!

13:12.993 --> 13:15.128
- HO.

13:15.162 --> 13:19.299
- FEELS A LONG TIME
SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.368
- IT WASN'T.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.137
- FEELS LIKE IT, THOUGH.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.074
[hinges squeaking]

13:27.107 --> 13:29.242
- OH, GOD BE PRAISED!

13:29.276 --> 13:32.980
OH, LOOK AT HIM.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.614
OH.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.183
BROTHER BOHANNON.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.218
- FATHER HATCH.
- WELL, COME IN.

13:38.251 --> 13:42.055
WHY ARE WE STAYIN' OUT HERE?
- THE BISHOP?

13:42.089 --> 13:46.293
- AH. HE'S LONG GONE,
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.394
NOW, YOU'VE BEEN TRAVELING.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.262
YOU'RE TIRED AND HUNGRY.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.899
YOUR MOMMA'S GONNA BE SO HAPPY.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.201
[Naomi laughs]

13:54.234 --> 13:56.303
- COME ON.
[clucks tongue]

14:05.145 --> 14:07.480
- WAIT HERE.

14:14.955 --> 14:18.091
YOU LOOK RATHER CAVALIER
FOR A MAN WHO'S SET TO HANG.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.094
- [laughs]

14:21.128 --> 14:25.065
- IS IT YOUR HABIT TO TAKE
THE LAW OF THE LAND SO LIGHTLY?

14:25.098 --> 14:27.000
- AIN'T THE USUAL THING
FOR A GOVERNOR

14:27.034 --> 14:31.038
TO COME DOWN HERE AND CONVERSATE
WITH CONDEMNED FUGITIVES.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.241
- I'M ASKIN' IF YOU HOLD THE LAW
IN CONTEMPT.

14:34.274 --> 14:38.445
- THE LAW AND ME HAVE BEEN
AT EACH OTHER PRETTY HARD

14:38.478 --> 14:41.314
FOR A LONG TIME NOW.

14:41.348 --> 14:45.052
WE KNOW EACH OTHER WELL.

14:50.023 --> 14:53.961
- YOU HAVE CERTAIN SKILLS,
MR. SNOW.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.498
I MAY HAVE NEED
FOR THOSE SKILLS.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.268
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU CAN
PUT THEM TO USE

15:01.301 --> 15:03.336
FOR SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOURSELF.

15:03.370 --> 15:08.308
- I HAVE NEVER TRIED.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.211
- WHAT IF IT WERE
WORTH YOUR LIFE?

15:14.381 --> 15:18.351
- DO YOU SWEAR TO ENFORCE
THE LAW OF WYOMING,

15:18.385 --> 15:21.354
ITS LETTER AND ITS SPIRIT,

15:21.388 --> 15:26.359
WITHOUT PREJUDICE OF PERSONS
IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES?

15:26.393 --> 15:28.428
- RIGHT, YEAH.
I DO.

15:28.461 --> 15:33.366
- THEN YOU'RE OUR NEW MARSHAL.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.103
- LOTS OF INDIVIDUALS
WILL BE SURPRISED.

15:36.136 --> 15:39.006
- CHEYENNE'S FULL OF MEN
WANTED ELSEWHERE.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.108
BAIL JUMPERS, FUGITIVES.

15:41.141 --> 15:45.178
ALSO INDENTURED FREEDMEN
AMONG THE RAILROAD WORKERS,

15:45.212 --> 15:46.646
VAGRANTS.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.316
DURANT HASN'T PAID THEIR BOND
IN YEARS.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.352
THAT MEANS THEY'RE ILLEGAL TOO.

15:52.385 --> 15:56.756
I WANT YOU TO ARREST THEM ALL.

15:56.789 --> 16:01.128
- GONNA NEED SOME DEPUTIES.
- TAKE THOSE.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.063
- [laughs] DAMN, BOYS,
IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.

16:09.602 --> 16:13.173
- TRAVEL 1 INCH
OUTSIDE MY ORDERS,

16:13.206 --> 16:17.044
I'LL TIE THE NOOSE MYSELF.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.411
- NOT TO WORRY, GOVERNOR.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.281
MY HONOR...
[spits]

16:21.314 --> 16:23.183
AS A GENTLEMAN.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.055
- YOU START WITH THOSE.

16:38.731 --> 16:42.502
- CHARLOTTE CAN COOK,
WASH, KEEP HOUSE.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.737
DOES HER FIGURES LIKE ANYTHING.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.740
SHE CAN READ AND WRITE
LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

16:47.774 --> 16:51.078
FOLKS CAN SEE
SHE'S A RESPECTABLE PERSON.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.253
- WE'LL GET YOU
A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.189
I'LL FIND SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO DO HERE.

17:02.222 --> 17:08.095
CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.462
- THANK--

17:09.496 --> 17:13.300
- IT'S OKAY.
- [sobs]

17:19.672 --> 17:23.210
THANK YOU.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.479
[crying]

17:26.513 --> 17:28.815
- [singing indistinctly]
- HE'S GOT EYES LIKE HIS PAPA.

17:28.848 --> 17:32.285
DON'T HE HAVE BROTHER
BOHANNON'S PRETTY EYES?

17:32.319 --> 17:33.720
[giggles]

17:33.753 --> 17:36.123
- HOW DARE YOU SAY
THAT ABOUT MY HUSBAND.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.624
- ESTHER'S GOT HER OWN BEAU.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.592
BROTHER MICHAEL DOONE.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.495
HE'S GOT EYES LIKE
AN OLD OX SITTIN' IN THE SUN.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.564
- [giggles]
- GIRLS.

17:44.597 --> 17:48.568
THIS IS NAOMI'S FIRST MEAL HOME.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.603
- SHE'S HAPPY TO BE AMONG THEM.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.374
- SHE'S MISSED THIS.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.509
THAT'S A FACT.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.246
- WELL, I CAN ONLY GUESS
AT WHAT'S BROUGHT YOU

17:59.279 --> 18:00.680
BACK FROM CHEYENNE.

18:00.713 --> 18:05.885
BUT IS THERE ANY GOOD REASON
YOU SHOULDN'T STAY ON?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.687
BOTH OF YOU, TOGETHER.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.290
WITH US.

AND CHILD LYING SLAUGHTERED

35:49.981 --> 35:52.351
BY INDIANS BESIDE A RIVER.

35:52.384 --> 35:57.956
AS I PRAYED OVER THEM,
I RECEIVED A MESSAGE--

35:57.989 --> 35:59.758
MESSAGE FROM HEAVENLY FATHER--

35:59.791 --> 36:03.562
THAT I SHOULD TAKE
THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN'S IDENTITY

36:03.595 --> 36:08.400
AND DO HIS BIDDEN WORK.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.271
IF I HAVE DONE WRONG.

36:12.304 --> 36:16.475
- YOU HAVE DONE WRONG
BY LYING TO ME NOW.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.644
- HMM?

36:18.677 --> 36:23.615
- HEAVENLY FATHER ENDOWED ME
WITH THE SPIRIT OF DISCERNMENT.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.890
BEGIN AGAIN.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.535

36:50.676 --> 36:56.382

OF THE DUTSONS?

36:56.415 --> 36:59.551

37:02.288 --> 37:07.293
I SAY AGAIN,
IT WAS A SIGN FROM GOD--

37:07.293 --> 37:09.795
HIS WILL--

37:09.828 --> 37:14.700
THAT I SHOULD TAKE
THEIR EARTHLY LIVES

37:14.733 --> 37:22.308
AND D-DRAPE MYSELF
IN DUTSON'S NAME AND PERSON.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.446
THEREAFTER,
I DID ALL I COULD TO--

37:27.479 --> 37:29.781

38:21.467 --> 38:25.837
I AM THOR GUNDERSEN...

38:28.774 --> 38:32.511
OF NORWAY.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.583
- WELL...

38:37.616 --> 38:43.922
THOR GUNDERSEN
OF NORWAY...

38:43.955 --> 38:50.396
YOU MAY GO FORWARD WITH ME
AND BEGIN LIFE AGAIN.

38:50.396 --> 38:55.401
[chuckles]
- [chortles]

38:55.401 --> 38:58.404
[sputters]

38:58.437 --> 39:00.406
BUT WHERE SHALL WE GO?

39:00.439 --> 39:01.873
- TIME WILL REVEAL.

39:01.907 --> 39:04.476
[both chortling]

39:04.510 --> 39:08.780
- FEW THINGS
I FIND PLEASANT IN CHEYENNE,

39:10.616 --> 39:13.619
BUT THIS WINE'S ONE.

39:13.652 --> 39:16.154
- WHAT ELSE?

39:16.187 --> 39:20.959
- SITTIN' ACROSS FROM YOU
WHILE I DRINK IT.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.597
- I AGREE...

39:25.631 --> 39:27.566
ABOUT THE WINE.

39:27.599 --> 39:30.536
- MM.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.971
NOW...

39:33.004 --> 39:38.009
YOU ARE NOT THE KIND OF LADY
I EXPECTED TO FIND OUT HERE.

39:38.043 --> 39:41.580
HOW IS IT THAT
AN EAST COAST SOPHISTICATE

39:41.613 --> 39:45.851
LIKE YOURSELF ENDS UP
IN A FRONTIER TOWN

39:45.884 --> 39:48.987
SURROUNDED BY
CHARLATANS LIKE DURANT,

39:49.020 --> 39:53.124
RUFFIANS
LIKE MICKEY MCGINNES...

39:53.158 --> 39:57.162
AND A DEFROCKED JOHNNY REB
LIKE BOHANNON?

39:57.195 --> 40:01.467
- I NOTICE YOU FORGOT
TO MENTION SIDNEY SNOW.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.604
HOW DOES A MAN
WHO SHOOTS UP A STORE

40:05.637 --> 40:08.774
AND KILLS A YOUNG BOY END UP
WEARING A MARSHAL'S BADGE?

40:08.807 --> 40:10.642
AND HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY
GIVING IT TO HIM?

40:10.676 --> 40:13.479
- GOOD QUESTION, MISS ELLISON.

40:13.512 --> 40:14.946
- MR. BOHANNON.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.882
- YOU'RE INTERRUPTING
OUR DINNER.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.017
- I AIM TO HEAR YOUR ANSWER.

40:19.050 --> 40:22.654
HOW'S A MAN APPOINTED BY GRANT
TO BRING LAW AND ORDER

40:22.688 --> 40:24.623
PUT A BADGE ON A MAD DOG
LIKE SIDNEY SNOW,

40:24.656 --> 40:26.558
AND THAT'S WHAT HE IS,
WE BOTH KNOW IT.

40:26.592 --> 40:29.961
- I'M JUST LUCKY I HAD A MAN
LIKE HIM TO PUT A BADGE ON.

40:29.995 --> 40:33.899
I'VE LOST TWO MARSHALS
TO VIOLENCE IN THIS TOWN,

40:33.932 --> 40:36.702
AND I DON'T NEED TO LOSE MORE
TO KNOW THAT I'M A LONG WAY

40:36.735 --> 40:40.972
FROM BEING ABLE TO USE PEACEFUL
MEANS TO BRING "LAW AND ORDER,"

40:41.006 --> 40:43.575
AS YOU PUT IT.

40:43.609 --> 40:49.715
I THINK MY NEW MARSHAL'S METHODS
EXACTLY FIT THE BILL.

40:49.748 --> 40:51.683
- WHAT SIDNEY'S BRINGING
AIN'T LAW AND ORDER,

40:51.717 --> 40:54.185
AND I CAN'T BUILD A RAILROAD
WITH THEM MEN IN JAIL.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.888
- THEN THE RAILROAD
AND EVERYTHING ELSE

40:56.922 --> 41:01.893
WILL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL I BRING THIS TOWN TO HEEL.

41:04.229 --> 41:08.867
- LET ME SPELL IT OUT
FOR YOU, MR. CAMPBELL.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.703
RELEASE THEM PRISONERS.

41:11.737 --> 41:16.174
I'M ONLY ASKIN' YOU ONCE.

41:18.176 --> 41:22.080
- IF THAT'S A THREAT,
I DIDN'T HEAR IT.

41:22.113 --> 41:26.151
NOW, WOULD YOU LET THIS LADY
AND ME GO ON WITH OUR DINNER?

41:34.826 --> 41:38.229
- YOU REMEMBER:

41:38.263 --> 41:40.932
I ASKED YOU
AS A GENTLEMAN FIRST.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.869
MISS ELLISON.
