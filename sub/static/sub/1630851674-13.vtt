WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:05.440
Previously onSEAL Team...

00:05.483 --> 00:07.094
Jason, what are you doing?

00:07.137 --> 00:10.227
Fucking doctor in Germany
told me I was at risk for TBI.

00:10.271 --> 00:13.056
Command taking my bird is
the worst way it could end.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.101
No one's going to Command,
all right?

00:14.144 --> 00:15.319
So put the gun down
and let's talk.

00:16.668 --> 00:19.062
RAY: I read about Marc when
I started working on my PTS.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.325
He found a way through. I figure
his story could help you.

00:21.369 --> 00:22.500
War fucked up my brain.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.067
I tried a few things
to un-fuck it up.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.764
I had the most success
with this.

00:25.808 --> 00:28.941
Those who drink San Pedro reach
some sort of enlightenment.

00:28.985 --> 00:31.422
One dose is not gonna
magically fix you.

00:31.466 --> 00:32.597
Now that we know
the dead Colectivos

00:32.641 --> 00:34.034
were exposed to uranium 235,

00:34.077 --> 00:36.949
I am just waiting on intel
from Smith

00:36.993 --> 00:39.082
so I can figure out where the
Venezuelans are enriching it.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.344
It's underground.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.129
The textile plant
is directly above

00:42.172 --> 00:43.434
this center.

00:43.478 --> 00:44.870
Hey, do you have any idea
where Sonny went?

00:44.914 --> 00:46.350
DAVIS:
Why, you worried about him?

00:46.394 --> 00:49.266
Say hello to my little Blondie.
[laughs]

00:49.310 --> 00:50.485
CLAY:
Where did you get all this shit?

00:50.528 --> 00:52.095
SOPHIE:
Local gangbangers,

00:52.139 --> 00:54.445
Hijos del Diablo.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.448
[grunting]

00:58.275 --> 00:59.624
CLAY:
I've never held my son.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.409
And he's been fighting
for his life. His reward

01:01.452 --> 01:02.975
was nearly losing his dad
because

01:03.019 --> 01:05.674
of your fucking pathetic ass.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.337
[birds chirping]

01:25.172 --> 01:28.218
You really didn't do all that
research on that TBI treatment

01:28.262 --> 01:29.437
for me, did you?

01:29.480 --> 01:31.961
Or was that all just
a bunch of bullshit?

01:33.789 --> 01:36.879
-It's all real.
-Yeah?

01:36.922 --> 01:39.316
I might have dropped
the crusade after Swanny,

01:39.360 --> 01:41.797
but I didn't lose interest
in the issue.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.322
It's kind of a weird hobby
if you ask me.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.715
[chuckles]

01:46.758 --> 01:48.325
But you know,
I'm grateful, though,

01:48.369 --> 01:51.720
that you read up on all of
that stuff for me, though.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.593
Well, if it keeps you
operating any longer,

01:55.637 --> 01:57.900
then we're all grateful.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.516
You know I wasn't trying
to push you out, right?

02:05.560 --> 02:07.692
Yeah.

02:07.736 --> 02:10.826
Yeah, sorry I called you
arrogant.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.045
You call me arrogant
for a lot of things.

02:13.089 --> 02:15.352
That's 'cause you are
arrogant, man. [chuckles]

02:15.396 --> 02:17.485
Gonna be wrong sometimes.

02:21.793 --> 02:24.361
You know, you leave your family
behind for the teams,

02:24.405 --> 02:26.146
man, for me.

02:26.189 --> 02:29.627
I just did what you
would have done.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.760
Team first, team-guy second.

02:31.803 --> 02:34.066
Done that enough to know
that there's a lot of

02:34.110 --> 02:37.331
collateral damage behind
that one, that's for sure.

02:38.201 --> 02:41.335
I'm sure Stella wasn't
too enthusiastic that you, uh,

02:41.378 --> 02:42.553
came along for the ride.

02:42.597 --> 02:46.601
She wasn't.
But she understood.

02:48.255 --> 02:52.302
I'm just hoping that Davis
can nail down this intel

02:52.346 --> 02:55.000
on the nuclear enrichment
facility so we can go home.

02:55.044 --> 02:58.656
Making hard choices
like you did, that's, uh...

02:58.700 --> 03:01.355
that's some team leader
stuff there.

03:01.398 --> 03:03.748
You think so?

03:03.792 --> 03:05.446
Too bad you lost your, uh...

03:05.489 --> 03:07.752
your shot
at getting my spot now, though.

03:07.796 --> 03:11.016
Since you put me back
on the path of healing my brain,

03:11.060 --> 03:14.498
I'll be operating Bravo
for the next 20 years. [laughs]

03:16.457 --> 03:19.503
Oh, we're, uh... we're happy

03:19.547 --> 03:22.680
to have you keep on engineering
the crazy train, boss.

03:22.724 --> 03:27.511
Long as you're with me,
the crazy train won't stop, man.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.513
♪

03:29.557 --> 03:31.428
[laughing]

03:36.041 --> 03:38.218
♪

03:45.616 --> 03:47.314
Dude, I am telling you
right now,

03:47.357 --> 03:51.187
Terry MacDunnagh--
he was 68 years old. 68.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.842
He was still hunting down
dirtbags, buggers.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.322
He was a badass, all right?

03:55.365 --> 03:58.150
Yup. We have seriously
created a monster here.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.849
This guy thinks he's still gonna
be operating when he's 75.

04:00.892 --> 04:03.286
-Damn straight.
-Did we really have that far
to go?

04:03.330 --> 04:06.246
-Yeah. We do.
-Oh, great. Great. [laughs]

04:06.289 --> 04:08.596
Hey, uh, any word on the op?

04:08.639 --> 04:11.729
Uh, nah. Davis is still waiting
to hear back from the Agency

04:11.773 --> 04:13.340
on their recon
of the site she identified.

04:13.383 --> 04:16.647
We could've just handled it
ourselves.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.214
Do not like all this
sitting around waiting.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.782
Neither do I,
but it lowers the risk

04:20.825 --> 04:22.914
of us getting spotted
and compromised.

04:22.958 --> 04:25.656
An op like this,
better safe than sorry, yeah?

04:25.700 --> 04:27.876
Look, man,
maybe I should read the team in

04:27.919 --> 04:29.443
on what's going on with my head.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.706
They have every right to know
who they're rolling with.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.579
Like you did with the PTS.

04:35.623 --> 04:39.017
Well,
the situation's not the same.

04:39.061 --> 04:41.759
Jace, I mean, the guys were
questioning my readiness

04:41.803 --> 04:44.327
after I froze up in Nigeria
and almost got Brock killed.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.981
I almost got
the entire team killed, Ray.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.331
-CLAY: Yeah,
but only Ray and I know that.
-Yeah.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.072
CLAY:
Doing it in the pressure cooker

04:50.115 --> 04:53.336
of this Omega deployment--
I mean, it's... it's not ideal.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.817
You know, wait till we get home
like Ray did.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.732
Oh, what if I fuck up again,
huh?

04:57.775 --> 04:59.124
We're not gonna let you.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.778
Look, Clay and I will cover
down on you,

05:00.822 --> 05:03.259
just like you've done countless
times for every one of us.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.435
And when you get back home,
you address it how you see fit.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.698
It seems like I'm putting it
on the back burner here.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.919
It's not. We got this.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.703
Teams and shit, man.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.749
Oh, yeah.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.142
Yeah. Yeah.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.232
Yeah.

05:21.059 --> 05:22.234
SONNY:
I'm starving.

05:22.278 --> 05:23.584
Clay, heading to lunch.
You want to join?

05:23.627 --> 05:26.674
Uh... No, I'm good, man.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.415
-Okay.
-Not sure I could stomach it.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.938
Actually, I kind of
lost my appetite.

05:29.981 --> 05:32.375
Uh, I'm probably just
gonna hang here.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.943
You know, hey,
on second thought,

05:34.986 --> 05:38.120
yeah, I'll use
a little fresh air.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.688
[clears throat]
Brock, you're driving.

05:48.478 --> 05:51.612
Ugh. [mutters]

05:54.310 --> 05:57.357
Yo, what's up with you two?

05:58.183 --> 06:00.185
Oh, it's just Brock-- he's...

06:00.229 --> 06:02.405
[chuckles] You know,
he's getting on my nerves.

06:02.449 --> 06:06.235
Just always standing there
looking all intense and...

06:06.278 --> 06:08.150
never says a damn word.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.065
I am not talking about Brock.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.807
I'm wondering why
you and Clay have been icy

06:12.850 --> 06:15.113
since Jason and I picked
you guys up the other day.

06:15.157 --> 06:18.639
[chuckles] You are too smart
to play dumb, Ray.

06:19.683 --> 06:24.122
Well, Clay and Jace are BFFs
again, which means

06:24.166 --> 06:28.300
that Blondedict Arnold probably
went and blabbed to Mom and Dad.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.172
Blabbed about what?

06:30.215 --> 06:32.174
He hasn't said a word
about anything,

06:32.217 --> 06:35.699
so, I mean, is there something
I should know about?

06:35.743 --> 06:38.006
Nah.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.313
Nah, just team guy bullshit.

06:42.576 --> 06:46.710
Well, the fact that you're not
ripping Clay a new one tells me

06:46.754 --> 06:48.712
that you're at fault.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.714
-So, what is it, brother?
-[chuckles]

06:50.758 --> 06:53.021
What-what happened?

06:54.065 --> 06:58.287
Hmm. Sonny Quinn happened.

07:13.345 --> 07:14.999
Thought you and the guys
went out for lunch.

07:15.043 --> 07:18.307
Yeah, that was the plan, and...

07:18.350 --> 07:20.004
then it wasn't.

07:23.355 --> 07:26.010
You know,
you can stay if you want,

07:26.054 --> 07:30.145
but, uh, you know, I understand
if you got to bounce

07:30.188 --> 07:33.322
rather, uh, then, uh,
be rubbing elbows with me.

07:34.366 --> 07:36.847
Sound like
you could use a friend.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.849
[chuckles, inhales sharply]

07:38.893 --> 07:41.243
Does that, uh...

07:41.286 --> 07:44.115
does that label still apply
to us?

07:45.726 --> 07:50.470
Yeah, I think I pissed everybody
off and drove 'em all away.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.775
In fact, I don't even
know how you're still

07:51.819 --> 07:55.605
standing in front of me
after I, uh...

07:55.649 --> 07:59.783
after I treated you so badly
recently.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.438
That almost sounded
like an apology.

08:03.657 --> 08:06.311
Ah. Mm.

08:06.355 --> 08:09.532
Yeah, I mean, you've been
one hell of an asshole lately.

08:11.534 --> 08:16.321
But the way Clay was worrying
when you dropped off the grid--

08:16.365 --> 08:18.976
I think maybe
we'll just call it a victory

08:19.020 --> 08:20.630
that you're still around
to be one.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.371
Getting a pat on the back
for still breathing

08:22.414 --> 08:25.505
is a very low bar.
[chuckles]

08:25.548 --> 08:29.813
But, uh, seems like the only
thing I can clear these days.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.554
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

08:31.598 --> 08:35.253
you're not the only one
stepping in the shit.

08:36.864 --> 08:40.171
[chuckles] Those-those dainty
little feet of yours?

08:40.215 --> 08:42.522
-Believe it.
-[laughs]

08:42.565 --> 08:45.176
Ah, so you're...
you're throwing the tomahawk

08:45.220 --> 08:46.787
to get rid of that stink?

08:46.830 --> 08:49.006
Oh, damn,
I wish it was that easy,

08:49.050 --> 08:54.185
but I really lit a fuse
with my white paper.

08:54.229 --> 08:56.361
Call me crazy,
but you, of all people,

08:56.405 --> 08:58.625
could weather
a few academic critiques.

08:58.668 --> 09:02.846
It's the, uh, professional ones
that I'm worried about.

09:03.717 --> 09:07.895
Navy captain emailed me,
asking for a one-on-one meeting.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.592
You know I always hated

09:09.636 --> 09:11.376
getting called
into the principal's office.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.378
Well, just wipe out
Venezuela's nuke program,

09:13.422 --> 09:16.468
and your career is saved.
No pressure.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.428
Yeah, we got a lot of hoops
to jump through

09:19.471 --> 09:21.604
before we can declare
mission success here.

09:21.648 --> 09:25.956
Yeah. Yeah, I got...

09:26.000 --> 09:27.958
a head full of questions.

09:31.353 --> 09:33.616
But there ain't a...

09:33.660 --> 09:36.532
a doubt in my mind that...

09:36.576 --> 09:39.274
you'll get her done.

09:39.317 --> 09:41.929
You always do, Davis.

09:44.192 --> 09:48.196
[phone buzzing]

09:48.239 --> 09:50.154
Smith.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.809
Let's, uh,
see if you're right.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.338
-Looks like Smith
and the Agency came through.
-What do we know?

10:00.382 --> 10:03.037
My source's recon
of the textile factory site

10:03.080 --> 10:06.562
Lieutenant Davis identified
shows her hunch is correct.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.217
JASON:
Oh.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.175
We looking at what I think
we're looking at?

10:11.219 --> 10:14.439
The Venezuelan program is much
further along than we thought.

10:14.483 --> 10:18.182
This is a fully operational
nuclear enrichment facility.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.186
Renegade country
that has the ability

10:22.230 --> 10:24.580
to make its own nukes
a stone throw from home.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.364
CLAY: Well, it's one thing
to stop them

10:26.408 --> 10:28.018
from getting a program
up and running.

10:28.062 --> 10:31.021
But now we have to dismantle an
active nuclear weapons factory.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.682
Do we have any images inside
other than the video?

10:39.726 --> 10:42.206
No. Risk to our source
was too high

10:42.250 --> 10:43.294
to get more
than what you see here.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.209
What we do know
from city records is

10:45.253 --> 10:47.124
that the textile factory sits
on top

10:47.168 --> 10:49.649
of a tunnel system
that was built in the 1950s.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.651
We found plans
on the Iranians' computer

10:51.694 --> 10:54.610
for a verified underground
facility outside Saveh.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.351
Okay, so it stands to reason

10:56.394 --> 10:58.570
that the Venezuelan used
the Iranian setup.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.616
Gives us a place to start.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.574
What do we know about security?

11:02.618 --> 11:05.447
It's tight. There's a large
contingent of VSP

11:05.490 --> 11:07.014
that patrol the area
on a loop.

11:07.057 --> 11:09.233
Well, we're hurting
in the headcount department.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.931
Uh, any chance
for reinforcement?

11:10.974 --> 11:14.456
I could knock the rust off
my gun, help you guys out.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.197
Yeah, I'm never gonna say "no"
to another shooter.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.981
More rifles in the fight helps,

11:18.025 --> 11:20.027
but how the hell are we actually
gonna do this?

11:20.070 --> 11:22.159
I mean, when the Israelis
took out that-that reactor

11:22.203 --> 11:23.334
in Syria,
they used airstrikes.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.423
What do you say there, Smitty?

11:25.467 --> 11:27.382
He did say we could get anything
we want,

11:27.425 --> 11:29.340
so, uh, what are the chances

11:29.384 --> 11:31.212
of you pulling some F15s
out of your ass?

11:31.255 --> 11:33.257
It's too much collateral damage

11:33.301 --> 11:35.129
to risk
on an urban target like this.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.087

could be me.

Jason took the building down.

there's a path to healing.
