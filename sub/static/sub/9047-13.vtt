00:02.268 --> 00:03.102
- Previously on <i>awkward...</i>

00:03.104 --> 00:04.236
- You can't leave with
the horseshoe

00:04.238 --> 00:06.638
Unless you pony up...
Your phone number.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.741
- You said you were never
embarrassed of me.

00:08.743 --> 00:10.943
- I lied.
- I got you this.

00:10.945 --> 00:12.544
All: Surprise!

00:13.246 --> 00:15.914
- Are you breaking up with me?
- I am so, so sorry, matty.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.583
I'm so sorry.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.919
- It had been three weeks since
matty and I had broken up.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.355
Three weeks in which
I'd cried my eyes out,

00:23.357 --> 00:26.425
Beaten myself up, and eaten
my weight in egg nog fro yo.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.293
If the mourning period
for an ex

00:28.295 --> 00:30.262
Was half the length
of the relationship,

00:30.264 --> 00:33.966
Technically, I was still getting
over matty.

00:33.968 --> 00:36.402
In reality, I had moved on,

00:36.404 --> 00:39.738
And was surprisingly ready
to try something new.

00:39.740 --> 00:43.042
In fact, I was trying
a lot of new things.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.377
Maybe it was the promise
of the new year,

00:45.379 --> 00:46.879
Or residual holiday spirit,

00:46.881 --> 00:48.781
But I felt hopeful
about the transition.

00:48.783 --> 00:51.950
Sure, my friends were going
to accept the change in me,

00:51.952 --> 00:55.087
And my relationship.
There would be no taking sides

00:55.089 --> 00:57.022
Or forcing people
to choose a team--

00:57.024 --> 01:01.827
Even though I had--and I was
definitely on team collin.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.429
- I'm telling you,
she's on team matty.

01:03.431 --> 01:07.699
- Sadie is not into matty.
She's just using him for rides.

01:07.701 --> 01:08.667
Since she's been
car-maxed out,

01:08.669 --> 01:10.836
"sucks-ton" has been making him
drive her to school every day.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.105
- I don't feel comfortable
gossiping about matty, okay?

01:13.107 --> 01:16.041
- Technically, we're gossiping,
you're accessorizing.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.310
- When did you start
accessorizing?

01:18.312 --> 01:20.045
And wearing skinny jeans?

01:20.047 --> 01:21.780
And when did you change up
your room?

01:21.782 --> 01:22.614
It's different.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.049
- Sometimes different is good.

01:24.051 --> 01:27.219
I just felt like it was time
to grow up.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.587
- Okay, ms. 401k.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.957
Far be it from us to keep you
from your night at the opera.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.225
- Collin and I
are going shopping

01:33.227 --> 01:34.827
At the school
consignment store.

01:34.829 --> 01:35.461
You want to come?

01:35.463 --> 01:39.865
- It's not that we don't want
to hang with you and collin,

01:39.867 --> 01:41.133
It's just...
- Weird!

01:41.135 --> 01:42.501
- It doesn't have to be.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.635
I just want to get back
to normal.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.572
- So do we, but our normal
is jenna and matty.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.606
- Well, there's a new normal.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.041
And I'm sure if you get
to know collin,

01:49.043 --> 01:50.609
You'll like him
as much as I do.

01:50.611 --> 01:54.580
- We'll hang next time.
Promise.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.082
[doorbell rings]

01:57.084 --> 01:57.916
- Uh, can you guys get that?

01:57.918 --> 02:00.953
And be nice.
- I punched the guy one time

02:00.955 --> 02:03.822
And you chris brown-ify me.

02:10.363 --> 02:11.497
- You don't have to stand
out there.

02:11.499 --> 02:15.400
Everyone in here is decent.
It looks like I'm au naturel,

02:15.402 --> 02:17.069
But I swear, I'm wearing
a sports bra.

02:17.071 --> 02:20.405
- Mom, don't say that
in front of--

02:22.375 --> 02:26.445
[keys tapping]

02:26.447 --> 02:29.281
Hi.

02:31.184 --> 02:34.653
- I was hoping we could talk.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.688
- I think you girls
should leave, and run

02:36.690 --> 02:40.559
Interference, since olin-snay
is on his way over, okay?

02:40.561 --> 02:44.329
- That's not how you say it,
but I can anslate-tray.

02:44.331 --> 02:48.133
We're on it.

02:48.135 --> 02:48.834
- Come in!

02:48.836 --> 02:51.203
How have you been?
What's going on?

02:51.205 --> 02:53.305
- Mom?
- Hmm?

02:53.307 --> 02:54.606
Oh, you want privacy.

02:54.608 --> 02:58.477
Do you want privacy?
- Mom.

03:01.447 --> 03:04.483
This is really weird.

03:07.320 --> 03:11.223
- Yeah.
And this is so much better.

03:12.225 --> 03:14.159
- Matty--
- listen, jenna--

03:14.161 --> 03:15.861
- No, you talk first,
since you're the one

03:15.863 --> 03:19.565
Who came over to do it.
I mean...

03:19.567 --> 03:21.833
Talk.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.836
- Jenna, I don't want you
to think that I hate you.

03:24.838 --> 03:25.437
- I don't.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.172
And I don't want you
to think that either.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.507
- I don't.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.575
- I've been
thinking about us,

03:29.577 --> 03:31.843
And it doesn't have
to be uncomfortable.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.179
- That is exactly what
I have been feeling,

03:34.181 --> 03:36.081
And that's why I think
we should...

03:36.083 --> 03:38.984
- Just forget about it.
- Get back together.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.119
I still love you, jenna.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.155
- Matty--
- I just don't understand

03:43.157 --> 03:44.656
How we could be the way we were

03:44.658 --> 03:45.991
And then just, what,
shut it all off?

03:45.993 --> 03:47.793
- I didn't.
- So why not start over?

03:47.795 --> 03:49.561
- I can't.
- If I can, you can.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.196
- I can't.
- Why not?

03:51.198 --> 03:53.432
- Because I don't want to.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.299
I just need a break.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.001
- I thought we were already
on a break?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.536
- No, we're broken up.

03:57.538 --> 03:58.737
We just need a break
from each other

03:58.739 --> 04:01.073
So that we can start
new chapters in our lives,

04:01.075 --> 04:04.142
And eventually
be friends again.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.748
- Okay.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.551
Yeah, sure.

04:15.588 --> 04:20.125
- Matty, I really don't want
this to be weird between us...

04:20.127 --> 04:22.427
Or our friends.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.062
- It won't be.

04:24.064 --> 04:27.199
[door opens, closes]
- whew.

04:27.201 --> 04:30.402
So how long do you think
this break is gonna last?

04:30.404 --> 04:32.738
I'm only asking because
we have tickets

04:32.740 --> 04:33.538
To the next clippers game,

04:33.540 --> 04:36.475
And your dad needs someone
to do high-impact

04:36.477 --> 04:36.975
High fives with.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.977
- If he needs someone there,
why doesn't he invite collin?

04:38.979 --> 04:43.115
- Sweetie, with everything
that's happened with matty?

04:43.117 --> 04:44.616
Well, it just
wouldn't be right.

04:44.618 --> 04:48.120
Besides, we don't even
know collin.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.321
- That was the problem.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.956
No one in my life knew collin.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.859
He was just that jerk
who destroyed my relationship,

04:53.861 --> 04:56.295
And the unfortunate victim
of some bad press.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.996
It was time to call
a press conference.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.599
[bell rings]
- you went to hamilton's house?

05:00.601 --> 05:03.168
You are such a dumbass.
- I know I'm a dumbass.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.337
- I deleted her number,
vms, texts,

05:05.339 --> 05:06.638
And skanky pics
from your phone.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.608
And yes, I saw the one of her
in her training bra.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.843
If only I could delete that
from my memory.

05:11.845 --> 05:12.411
- Me too.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.546
- Put away your cry face,
mckibben.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.480
You think jenna cheating on you

05:15.482 --> 05:17.849
Isn't a big whore deal,
but it is.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.518
You should hate her
for what she did.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.219
- You don't have to hate her
because of me.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.255
Jenna doesn't want everybody
taking sides.

05:23.257 --> 05:24.723
- What kind of [bleep]-up,

05:24.725 --> 05:26.258
Apocalyptic world
are we living in

05:26.260 --> 05:29.861
Where jenna hamilton gets
to call the shots?

05:29.863 --> 05:32.130
[phone chirps]

05:32.132 --> 05:33.965
Devon is texting you?

05:33.967 --> 05:37.536
And you're texting her,
a lot!

05:37.538 --> 05:38.470
I love devon.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.605
Why am I consoling you when
you are clearly moving on?

05:40.607 --> 05:43.108
- Well, I'm taking it slow.
- Which may be a problem,

05:43.110 --> 05:45.510
Because slow is not
devon's speed.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.914
- Okay, so maybe I'll have
to speed up my process.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.249
[phone whirs]

05:51.251 --> 05:52.117
- It's from me.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.051
It says
I'm walking towards you,

05:53.053 --> 05:56.555
And we'll be saying "hi"
in about four seconds.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.989
Hi.
- What are you doing here?

05:57.991 --> 06:00.425
- You invited me to lunch.
- When?

06:00.427 --> 06:02.160
- At the frozen yogurt place.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.729
- We didn't even speak.

06:03.731 --> 06:07.899
- We did, telepathically.
Otherwise, why would I be here?

06:07.901 --> 06:10.268
- Because you're
a freak of nature.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.137
What are you doing?
[phone camera clicks]

06:12.139 --> 06:13.572
- It'll be easier for you
to remember

06:13.574 --> 06:15.440
My face if you're looking
at a copy of me

06:15.442 --> 06:16.141
Instead of the real me.

06:16.143 --> 06:19.010
- Yet I prefer
to forget you both.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.947
- I'll hold a table in
the center of the quad for us.

06:21.949 --> 06:22.547
Bring sunscreen.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.484
It's been proven to delay
the effects of melanoma.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.353
- A barbecue is the perfect way
to ease the weirdness.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.288
You know,
make the transition easier?

06:30.290 --> 06:31.289
- Who's coming?
- Everybody.

06:31.291 --> 06:34.192
You, me, jake,
fred, ming, collin.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.295
- So everybody except matty.
- Trust me,

06:37.297 --> 06:38.663
Matty wouldn't
want our breakup

06:38.665 --> 06:40.465
To put a damper on the group
any more than I do.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.835
- Look, I know you want this
to be all easy, breezy, b.C.G.,

06:43.837 --> 06:46.972
But, like this sloppy joe,
breakups are messy.

06:46.974 --> 06:50.142
- This is important to me,
and you promised.

06:50.144 --> 06:50.809
- [sighs]

06:50.811 --> 06:53.545
I'll bring the plastic
ice cubes.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.846
- Mind if I join you guys?

06:54.848 --> 06:57.215
- What are you doing
tomorrow night?

06:57.217 --> 06:57.983
- Whatever you want me to.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.352
- Then, you're coming
to a party at my house.

07:00.354 --> 07:01.286
Just a handful of people.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.789
Tamara will be there.
- What's up, iron fist?

07:03.791 --> 07:05.490
- [chuckles]
oh!

07:05.492 --> 07:08.627
This table is too small
for all of us.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.396
Jake, matty, sit with me
on the grass.

07:11.398 --> 07:15.500
Ming, fred, you stay here since
you're allergic to dew.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.002
- Where did you meet him?

07:17.004 --> 07:19.137
- At that dumb thadwick
Halloween party.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.906
He's some bitch's
boo radley brother.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.574
- He doesn't look like
a psycho.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.843
He's really cute.
- Too bad he's touched.

07:24.845 --> 07:27.679
- [gasps] by an angel?
- In the head, diphole.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.314
- So you don't like-like him.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.883
- It's kind of hard for me
to get it up for a guy who

07:31.885 --> 07:34.953
Probably has dead hamsters
in his freezer.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.789
- So if you're out,
then he's available,

07:37.791 --> 07:38.824
Like, for me.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.992
- You want to date austin?
- But no sex.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.227
I'm re-virginizing for jesus.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.662
They say if you pray
hard enough,

07:43.664 --> 07:46.331
It can grow back.
I hope it's not painful.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.266
How do I look?

07:48.268 --> 07:51.703
- Like a fancy popsicle.
- [squeals]

07:54.907 --> 07:55.674
- That's your lunch?

07:55.676 --> 07:57.142
Please tell me you're
not "manorexic."

07:57.144 --> 07:59.077
- I'm exactly the right weight
for my height.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.479
In addition to being good
for the eyes,

08:00.481 --> 08:03.982
Carrots are nature's
most attractive vegetables.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.018
[chuckles]
- [laughs]

08:07.020 --> 08:07.719
- Who's that one?

08:07.721 --> 08:10.021
- I'm lissa,
sadie's best friend.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.325
Sadie has told me all about you.
- Of course she did.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.993
She's in love with me.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.762
- Oh, look, the bus
from "crazy go nuts" high.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.598
Don't let it
leave without you.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.501
Bye.
- But I still have nine carrots.

08:22.503 --> 08:25.470
- Can I have one?

08:27.807 --> 08:30.742
Hey! Did you know sadie's
last boyfriend died,

08:30.744 --> 08:32.210
And everyone thought
she killed him?

08:32.212 --> 08:36.114
That was after they thought
she was pregnant with his baby.

08:38.251 --> 08:38.950
- If you ever kill me,

08:38.952 --> 08:41.653
I can only hope you'll keep
our murder baby.

- Yes, for my best friend.

08:55.502 --> 08:56.568
- Go to the damn barbecue.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.903
I seriously don't care.
- See, jake?

08:57.905 --> 08:59.538
He's good.
If he doesn't have a problem

08:59.540 --> 09:01.473
With it, why should you?
- He's not good.

09:01.475 --> 09:02.841
He's barely using any product

09:02.843 --> 09:06.011
And his hair is limp.
And that face?

09:06.013 --> 09:07.245
It's not a happy one.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.681
So you have fun at the barbecue.
I'm not going.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.551
- ♪ I'm changing everything
because I can ♪

09:12.553 --> 09:15.820
- ♪ whoa-oh
- ♪ I'm livin' up a new life ♪

09:15.822 --> 09:17.422
- Sorry, man.
I tried.

09:17.424 --> 09:20.191
- Our babies would look like
little channing tatums.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.993
I wonder if they'll be able
to dance.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.128
[gasps]
or strip.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.996
- What is your obsession
with austin?

09:24.998 --> 09:25.730
You don't even know him.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.699
- He's hot.
That's all I need to know.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.402
Beside, if you don't want
to date him,

09:30.404 --> 09:31.303
Why can't I?

09:31.305 --> 09:32.637
- Of course I don't want
to date him.

09:32.639 --> 09:35.307
I couldn't even fit
in his jeans.

09:35.309 --> 09:36.841
[phone beeps]

09:36.843 --> 09:38.276
Hey, it's me.

09:38.278 --> 09:42.881
No, I don't miss you.
I don't even think about you.

09:42.883 --> 09:46.084
You're going out
with my friend Saturday.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.020
- [squeals]
yay!

09:52.291 --> 09:54.059
- I know you're excited
about this party,

09:54.061 --> 09:55.627
But don't feel like you have
to do this.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.896
Your friends might need
some time to adjust.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.130
- What they need
is time with you.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.299
- I don't want them feeling
pressure to take sides.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.369
- Trust me,
no one is taking sides.

10:04.371 --> 10:08.039
- I'm totally on your side.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.078
- Mom?
Can I see you in the kitchen?

10:13.080 --> 10:16.281
- I think you can see me
just fine right here.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.389
- You cannot hang out
with matty.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.559
- I am not hanging out
with matty.

10:27.561 --> 10:28.860
He's...

10:28.862 --> 10:30.595
Hanging out with me.
- But you're my mom.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.832
Don't you see what's wrong
with this picture?

10:35.434 --> 10:37.435
If you're gonna take sides,
it has to be mine,

10:37.437 --> 10:41.439
Which means you have to break up
with matty too.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.176
- We had something special,

10:45.178 --> 10:49.214
And I want you to know,
it meant a lot to me.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.416
- Me too.
- And I hate having to do this.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.118
- So don't.
- I have to.

10:53.120 --> 10:57.222
Our timing is just--
[sighs]--off.

10:57.224 --> 11:01.259
But I don't want to lose you
as a friend,

11:01.261 --> 11:04.362
But I have to.
You should know,

11:04.364 --> 11:07.132
It's not you, it's me.

11:08.434 --> 11:12.404
Actually, it's jenna.
- I'm gonna go.

11:12.406 --> 11:15.373
Good-bye, mrs. Hamilton.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.809
- Matty, wait!

11:19.879 --> 11:23.481
Take these to remember me by.

11:27.319 --> 11:29.421
- Iron fist here?
- No one is.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.322
Should I be worried?
- No.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.125
You should be kissed.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.231
- Whoa-ho.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.966
Hi, collin.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.735
- Mr. Hamilton.
How are you, sir?

11:43.737 --> 11:47.005
- Good.
Just manning the grill.

11:47.007 --> 11:50.308
Taking my time
with the burgers.

11:52.645 --> 11:55.447
Cooking them real slow.

11:55.449 --> 11:59.084
You gotta cook 'em
real, real slow...

11:59.086 --> 12:00.151
So nothing gets burned.

12:00.153 --> 12:05.190
- ♪ I was living all
in my mind ♪

12:06.692 --> 12:09.327
- Jenna sure is going through
boys fast.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.163
- Mm, it must be so weird
for you.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.399
All those taut,
masculine bodies

12:14.401 --> 12:15.366
Parading through the house

12:15.368 --> 12:18.603
In low-hanging board shorts
and tank tops.

12:18.605 --> 12:19.871
- They're just boys.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.640
- Yeah, but the age gap
is rapidly closing.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.943
I'm sure you can't help but
to find yourself attracted

12:24.945 --> 12:28.046
To the ones that have moved
into their man bodies.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.881
- Oh, I can help it.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.983
- Hi, ms. Hamilton.

12:31.985 --> 12:32.817
Ms. Marks.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.053
- Hey.
- Where are you two going?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.054
- To a barbecue.
- Oh.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.022
I thought you didn't
like barbecues.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.324
- Oh, I never said that.

12:39.326 --> 12:42.961
But since you're so
into barbecues,

12:42.963 --> 12:44.896
And they're
so important to you,

12:44.898 --> 12:47.966
I thought
I'd give them a shot.

12:47.968 --> 12:51.369
- [whispering]
they're talking about you.

12:51.371 --> 12:55.006
- I would love it
if you both could stay.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.941
- Why, thank you, collin.
We will.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.476
- Great.
- Such a sweetie.

12:58.478 --> 13:02.013
Feel free to change into
your board shorts at any time.

13:06.385 --> 13:09.587
- He's no matty.
- Not even close.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.723
To matty.

13:11.725 --> 13:14.025
- I can't believe you just
made me sit through that movie.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.094
- I can't believe I made myself
sit through it.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.464
Why do people think
anne hathaway is a good actress?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.132
- Hmm, she's sexy.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.033
- I know it's common knowledge,

13:22.035 --> 13:25.770
But you have terrible taste
in women...

13:25.772 --> 13:28.306
Except for devon!

13:28.308 --> 13:31.376
And you should
get on that asap.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.577
- Yeah, maybe I will.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.280
You know, you don't have
to distract me all afternoon.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.615
It's just a stupid barbecue.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.550
I can handle it.
[phone chirps]

13:38.552 --> 13:41.152
- Actually,
you're distracting me.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.189
"dexter" is still calling
and texting me

13:44.191 --> 13:47.292
A billion times a day.
- Oh.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.494
Wow, yeah, he's hot.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.962
And you like him.

13:50.964 --> 13:51.563
- I do not.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.932
- Then why is his picture
in your phone?

13:53.934 --> 13:55.466
- The psycho put it in there.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.101
- Yeah, but you didn't
delete it.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.770
- Whatever.

13:58.772 --> 13:59.804
He's into lissa.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.973
- Then why is he texting you?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.107
- Anyone seen my phone?

14:03.109 --> 14:03.975
[bleep]!
Jenna is gonna think

14:03.977 --> 14:05.076
We're showing up late
on purpose.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.011
- Aren't we?
- Forget about your phone.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.213
Let's get this
over with already.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.214
- Do you think
I want to do this?

14:09.216 --> 14:10.815
- You made it pretty clear
that you did yesterday.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.383
- I punched collin
in the face,

14:12.385 --> 14:14.252
And had to keep the secret
about their affair.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.055
I really don't want to go.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.759
- You knew about jenna
cheating on matty

14:21.761 --> 14:24.762
Before her party
and you didn't tell me?

14:24.764 --> 14:27.966
- I was sworn to secrecy.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.534
- Matty is my best friend.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.501
I could have
warned him so that

14:30.503 --> 14:32.904
He didn't have to be made
an ass of in front of everyone.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.907
Jenna humiliated him,
the way that she humiliated me.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.042
- Why do you keep
bringing that up?

14:38.044 --> 14:38.977
- Oh, I'm done bringing it up.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.646
You'll never hear it
from me again...

14:41.648 --> 14:45.216
Or anything else
for that matter.

14:46.018 --> 14:50.822
[door slams]
- [crying]

14:50.824 --> 14:52.690
- So no barbecue?

14:53.659 --> 14:54.325
- With tamara involved,

14:54.327 --> 14:56.160
I knew my friends
would be fashionably late.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.429
But, after an hour,
they were bordering

14:58.431 --> 14:59.797
On fashionably
missing my party,

14:59.799 --> 15:03.001
Which had already been
downgraded to a lame cookout...

15:03.003 --> 15:05.003
[door sliding]

15:05.005 --> 15:07.705
Because no one under 30
had shown up.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.842
- Where are all the hotties?
- Hot dogs.

15:10.844 --> 15:11.910
She means hot dogs.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.578
- Jenna, I've got to take
these burgers off.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.413
Any more fire and they'll
be cremated.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.449
- Let's just wait
for everybody else.

15:20.519 --> 15:21.753
- [grunts]

15:21.755 --> 15:23.688
No one was answering
the front door.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.290
Sorry I'm late.
- No worries.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.925
Where's ming?
- We drove separately.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.560
You know, the huangs.
So overprotective.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.896
Ming texted.
They're running late.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.899
- How late?
[phone whooshes]

15:34.901 --> 15:37.535
- They're not coming.

15:39.905 --> 15:40.939
- I can't believe they bailed.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.573
- Jenna, put yourself
in their shoes.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.375
You're asking them
to hang out with the guy

15:44.377 --> 15:46.411
Who broke up their friends.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.446
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.481
They don't have to like me.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.017
Hey, come here.

15:53.019 --> 15:56.120
The only person I care
who likes me is you.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.156
- Why can't they be happy
that I'm happy?

15:58.158 --> 16:02.260
- They'll come around.
- And if they don't?

16:02.262 --> 16:03.227
- Time will tell.

16:03.229 --> 16:05.229
There are some friends who roll
with the punches,

16:05.231 --> 16:07.865
And some
who are hand slappers.

16:07.867 --> 16:08.533
My grandmother says it.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.935
It's like when a kid
does something they shouldn't,

16:10.937 --> 16:12.704
And you slap their hand.
It doesn't hurt,

16:12.706 --> 16:14.205
But it sends a message.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.874
- Oh, you're wrong.
It does hurt.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.810
Do you think that's what
this is about?

16:18.812 --> 16:19.277
- Maybe.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.279
I don't want to come
between you and your friends,

16:21.281 --> 16:24.816
So if you need us to take
a step back, we can.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.651
- No.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.853
I just need
to talk to them.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.756
- Okay.
Well, I'm around.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.392
If you need me, just call.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.499
- I had been holding back
my feelings,

16:41.501 --> 16:44.235
But it was time
to get them out.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.406
- It's tamara.
You know what to do.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.009
- One way or another.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.679
[phone chirps]
- [giggles]

16:54.681 --> 16:57.115

16:57.117 --> 16:57.949
You laughed.

16:57.951 --> 17:00.284
And not at him--
with him.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.020
You really like him.
- Shut up.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.721
- Why don't you go for it?

17:03.723 --> 17:05.223
- Because it would never work.

17:05.224 --> 17:06.924
Because my life sucks,

17:06.925 --> 17:08.291
And nothing good
ever happens to me.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.762
- Your life sucks?
Try being me for a day.

17:10.763 --> 17:11.829
- [scoffs]

17:11.830 --> 17:12.896
You wanna go there,
mckibben?

17:12.898 --> 17:15.833
Because I will
win this suck-fest.

17:15.835 --> 17:16.733
- No way.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.301
My girlfriend
cheated on me,

17:18.304 --> 17:19.971
And I found out
along with a dozen

17:19.973 --> 17:20.838
Of my closest friends.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.607
And I want to beat
the crap out of the guy,

17:22.608 --> 17:24.742
But I can't,
because everyone expects me

17:24.743 --> 17:25.843
To be the dick
in this situation,

17:25.845 --> 17:27.944
And I refuse
to give them the satisfaction.

17:27.946 --> 17:30.915
- My boyfriend
cheated on me with a dude,

17:30.917 --> 17:32.817
Then screwed my best friend
and then died,

17:32.819 --> 17:34.752
And everybody
thought I killed him.

17:34.754 --> 17:35.753
Not done yet.

17:35.755 --> 17:36.687
Then my parents went broke,

17:36.689 --> 17:38.456
So we had
to sell the house, the cars,

17:38.458 --> 17:39.357
And now they're divorcing.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.559
And the dung icing
on my crap cupcake--

17:41.561 --> 17:43.694
My dad auctioned
off my beloved horse,

17:43.696 --> 17:47.065
Priscilla,
queen of the desert.

17:47.067 --> 17:51.035
- You win.
Your life does suck.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.671
[both laugh]

17:53.673 --> 17:55.540
And that's why you gotta
give this guy a shot.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.242
But if you're too much
of a pussy to make a move,

17:58.244 --> 18:02.246
I will,
because that is one sexy dude.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.819
[phone beeps]

18:07.821 --> 18:11.989
- Liss,
you can't date austin.

18:11.991 --> 18:16.260
Turns out
he's seeing someone else.

his stupid face again!

18:19.933 --> 18:20.932
He is such a jerk.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.567
His mom should have
named him jerk rosati.

a drama-natrix.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.104
Tell him you're sorry
and move on.

We are so late
for jenna's party.

She is gonna kill us.

- No, I already texted fred,
like, a half hour ago

18:32.545 --> 18:33.678
To tell her
we're not coming.

and unevolved,

And can't be happy
because I'm happy"?

What's a hand slapper?

Your text was pretty loud.

- Oh, so now you're gonna
blame this on me?

19:02.408 --> 19:05.476
- Hey, jake and I had
a huge fight because of you.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.844
- Well, you and jake
wouldn't even be together

19:06.846 --> 19:09.080
If it weren't for me.
- How do you figure that?

19:09.082 --> 19:10.915
- Because most friends
wouldn't be cool

19:10.917 --> 19:12.650
With their friends
dating their exes,

19:12.652 --> 19:15.920
And you did it two seconds
after jake and I broke up.

19:15.922 --> 19:16.954

never done it

19:16.956 --> 19:18.689
If I didn't think
you were okay with it.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.758

You're such a follower.

"cray" poupon at your barbecue?

19:32.872 --> 19:34.472
'cause you're acting insane.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.943
And not even
bothering to call.

19:38.945 --> 19:39.911

19:39.913 --> 19:41.812
You are not just changing
the way you dress.

You're changing
your personality for this guy.

And you can't
even see it.

you are disloyal backstabbers,

And you are totally
taking sides.

We weren't taking sides,

that I knew

Couldn't be taken back.

And I realized going to 11
on the freak-ometer

20:08.608 --> 20:11.542
Didn't help anything,
but I knew what would.

It was time for me to embrace
a new kind of change.
