to know that you care,
but I can't ignore Josh.

a little more helpful after
everything you did to him.

- Fine. I'll sell you
Darnell's wedding suit.
- The purple tux?

that had grass stains
on the back of it.

I wanted a big turnout
at the funeral,

10:55.288 --> 10:57.390
so I put up a flier
at the Crab Shack...

10:57.457 --> 11:00.493
advertising free food
and free booze
for all mourners.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.496

I'd put together
a dignified funeral...

be remembered.

exactly as I planned.

Hey, Earl, if people
don't eat all the food,
can I take it?

I could feed the kids
for weeks on this.

out of the cake?

about the dead guy.
This is his funeral.

Earl, uh, quick question.
Why is the dead guy
wearing my suit?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.734
Oh, I sold it to Earl
for 50 bucks.

I love that suit,
and I can't replace it.

The E.P.A. says
the dye is poisonous,
and they can't make it anymore.

Look, Darnell, you'll get
the suit back just as soon
as the ceremony's over, okay?

his dead skin touching

We were looking for apartments,

my coworkers
at Club Chubby.

I got a free lap dance
on the way over.

there were more people
than seats in the car.

reading that dead people
can still "flatulate."

"flatulating" in my suit?
'Cause that ain't cool.
