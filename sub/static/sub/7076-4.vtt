You didn't have
some of the ingredients,

Doesn't bother me.
I've hardly missed you at all

it was designed for me.

02:04.138 --> 02:06.205
It was. I made that in

said it out loud.

09:23.587 --> 09:26.818
you've got a... bowl full
of olives next to the toilet.

09:26.836 --> 09:28.385
It's a fancy party, Britta.

09:28.420 --> 09:31.252
You know what Jeff has
in his bathroom?

09:31.286 --> 09:32.918
Neither do I.

09:32.953 --> 09:36.052
He keeps his toiletries
in a safe under the sink.

09:36.086 --> 09:39.786
His whole personality is based
around guarding himself.

09:39.820 --> 09:44.652
You don't have to be like that
to be a man.

09:44.687 --> 09:47.452
You're really cool, Britta.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.986
Man, pizza guys are getting
worse and worse-looking.

09:50.020 --> 09:52.485
Guess all the good ones
went into porn.

09:52.503 --> 09:54.819
- Ceiling fan.
- I miss all the fun.

09:54.837 --> 09:56.519
I wonder what happened
in all those other timelines.

09:56.553 --> 10:00.385
Troy & Britta: Who cares?

10:05.353 --> 10:06.786
Okay.

10:06.820 --> 10:09.452
Starting on my left with one,
your number comes up, you go.

10:09.486 --> 10:10.452
Just so you know, Jeff,
you are now creating

10:10.486 --> 10:11.452
six different timelines.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.169
Of course I am, Abed.

10:17.204 --> 10:20.036
Six. One, two, three,
four, five, six-- Britta.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.019
- Great.
- Great.

10:22.054 --> 10:24.019
You know what's great?
Air travel.

10:24.054 --> 10:27.186
I've flown a lot, a lot
of airplane stories.

10:27.221 --> 10:28.553
I once had sex
with Eartha Kitt--

10:28.588 --> 10:30.587
Okay, I'm gonna check
on my pies.

10:37.254 --> 10:38.386
You guys are my best--

10:38.421 --> 10:40.536
I'm gonna get a drink.
Ow!

10:41.588 --> 10:42.836
Oh, my God, are you okay?

10:42.870 --> 10:43.869
Barely felt it.

10:43.920 --> 10:47.186
Let me look at it
in the bathroom.

10:47.221 --> 10:49.353
Do I need to refill
the toilet olives?

10:49.387 --> 10:51.119
- We're good. I checked.
- You're the best.

10:51.154 --> 10:52.386
Want to stay up all night
talking in our bunk beds?

10:52.421 --> 10:54.169
Duh-doy.

10:54.204 --> 10:56.870
Here, Troy.
Happy housewarming.

10:56.921 --> 10:59.820
Oh, cool.
Thanks, Pierce.

10:59.854 --> 11:01.386
You make a good nurse, Annie.

11:01.421 --> 11:03.004
Thank you.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.536
I actually had to apply
a tourniquet the other day.

11:05.588 --> 11:07.987
A guy got stabbed
outside my building--

11:08.005 --> 11:10.887
What? Annie, you've got to get
the hell out of that apartment.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.386
You don't have to treat me
like a kid anymore, remember?

11:13.421 --> 11:16.221
Yeah, but adults
still need to be protected.

11:16.255 --> 11:19.221
I-I can't help but
worry about you, Annie.

11:19.255 --> 11:22.254
You're important to me.

11:26.055 --> 11:28.354
Feel the terror!
Stop the tantrum!

11:28.388 --> 11:31.204
Feel the terror
of the Norwegian troll!

11:31.255 --> 11:32.670
What's going on in here?

11:32.704 --> 11:34.054
Pierce is terrorizing Troy
because he's jealous

11:34.088 --> 11:35.153
we moved in together.

11:35.171 --> 11:36.387
You're the one who's jealous.

11:36.422 --> 11:37.454
Why would I be jealous?

11:37.488 --> 11:39.787
Because you're lonely
and crazy.

11:45.322 --> 11:48.654
Hey, guys, this is Toby,
our pizza delivery guy.

11:48.672 --> 11:50.187
And I know this
is gonna sound nuts,

11:50.222 --> 11:53.954
but we're in love
and we're getting married.

11:59.921 --> 12:03.321
I wonder what happened
in all those other timelines.

12:03.355 --> 12:05.821
Wait, there are
other timelines?

12:07.922 --> 12:09.354

One. Troy.

12:21.089 --> 12:22.588
Damn it.

12:22.622 --> 12:25.155
I'm gonna go as fast as I can
so I don't miss anything.

12:27.522 --> 12:28.688
Adiós, Sapito.

12:28.722 --> 12:30.171
You know who I used
to call miss anything?

12:30.206 --> 12:31.387
Eartha Kitt.

12:31.422 --> 12:34.487

Hey, while we're alone,
I just wanted to say,

14:56.229 --> 14:57.696
thanks for letting me
live with you.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.030
Sometimes I feel
like making desserts

14:59.064 --> 15:01.898
is the only thing I'm good
for in the group.

15:01.932 --> 15:04.865

15:07.434 --> 15:08.667
I can't help but

you should open this.

talking about?

15:11.369 --> 15:13.836
You're very important to me.

15:13.870 --> 15:15.904
Crap. I was not supposed
to eat your stuff.

15:15.938 --> 15:17.070

Crap, okay, cards on the table,
I'm really high right now.

15:24.540 --> 15:25.741
- Seriously!
- Would you stop and give me--

15:25.775 --> 15:26.808
No, I wanna give you
something else.

15:26.842 --> 15:27.841
A waterpik!

15:27.875 --> 15:29.875
A speedboat!
Two waterpiks.

15:29.893 --> 15:31.843

I'm feeding my pies

15:31.877 --> 15:33.010

15:33.044 --> 15:35.378
Drug addict?
You're a pie pusher!

15:35.412 --> 15:37.712

15:40.931 --> 15:45.715
I'm sorry, I just...
had a weird déjà vu.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.099
You're bad at gift-giving!

15:47.150 --> 15:49.217
That thing you said
about worrying about me...

15:49.251 --> 15:51.350
It's something
my dad always said.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.767
I demand to be housewarmed!

15:52.819 --> 15:55.119
Shouldn't have brought it up.

15:55.153 --> 15:57.553
Just reminded me of my dad.
Anyway...

15:57.571 --> 15:59.887
Stop. A little Make Out 101.

15:59.905 --> 16:01.321
Less dad talk.

16:01.355 --> 16:03.889

You're a sick, sad,
twisted old man.

16:16.561 --> 16:18.562
And I hope you die alone.

16:22.164 --> 16:24.931
I wonder what happened
in all those other timelines.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.433
I gotta say, I hope
this is the real one,

16:30.467 --> 16:31.900
because I just found
a nickel in the hallway.

16:37.803 --> 16:39.254
Okay.

you are now creating

16:43.122 --> 16:45.739
- six different timelines.
- Of course I am, Abed.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.275
I don't think you should.

16:52.310 --> 16:55.610
Chaos already dominates
enough of our lives.

16:55.644 --> 16:58.911
The universe is an endless
raging sea of randomness.

16:58.946 --> 17:00.245
Our job isn't to fight it,
but to weather it--together.

17:00.279 --> 17:01.712
On the raft of life.

17:01.746 --> 17:03.213
A raft held together by

17:03.247 --> 17:05.614
those few rare, beautiful things
that we know to be predictable.

17:05.647 --> 17:07.080

17:07.115 --> 17:08.515
Vines. Vines?

17:08.549 --> 17:09.647

17:09.683 --> 17:11.749
Us.

17:11.784 --> 17:13.050
It won't matter
what happens to us

17:13.084 --> 17:14.218
as long as we stay
honest and accepting

17:14.252 --> 17:15.984
of each ether's
flaws and virtues.

17:16.018 --> 17:17.984
Annie will always be driven.
Shirley will always be giving.

17:18.019 --> 17:19.352
Pierce will never apologize.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.220
Britta's sort of a wild card
from my perspective.

17:21.253 --> 17:24.155
And Jeff will forever remain
a conniving son-of-a-bitch.

17:24.189 --> 17:25.555
Abed!

17:25.589 --> 17:27.323
There are six sides to
this die and seven of us.

he never has to get the pizza.

17:29.490 --> 17:30.791

- Really? Dang, man.

- Asshole.
- Pretty low, dude.

17:34.860 --> 17:37.594
It's called friendship,
look it up. Encarta it.

17:37.628 --> 17:40.828
I think we just found
our pizza-getter.

17:40.863 --> 17:42.445
Yes, we did!

17:43.697 --> 17:44.646
Oh, like it matters who goes.

19:25.353 --> 19:28.386
he tried to destroy a flaming
troll doll by eating it.

19:28.422 --> 19:29.634
Clearly you don't understand

19:29.669 --> 19:31.590
anything about
defeating trolls.

19:31.624 --> 19:34.490
Life has gone to hell, Abed.

19:34.524 --> 19:35.770
This is real!

19:35.805 --> 19:38.299
Look at us.
Look at me!

19:38.334 --> 19:40.726
Britta, you put one wash-away
blue streak in your hair.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.648
And I lost an arm.

19:42.684 --> 19:44.891
Exactly.
Life got dark.

19:44.925 --> 19:46.020
And all because
Jeff rolled a one.

19:46.055 --> 19:48.043
Oh, I love how this is
my fault somehow.

19:48.078 --> 19:49.358
It's mine.

19:49.393 --> 19:50.791
I've run over that night
over and over in my head,

19:50.826 --> 19:52.140
and I keep coming back
to one thought.

19:52.174 --> 19:54.180
I should've caught the die
and not let you roll it.

19:54.214 --> 19:56.978
I failed to do that
and we all suffered for it.

19:57.012 --> 20:00.181
But I'm gonna
make it up to you.

20:00.216 --> 20:01.564
What is this?

20:01.598 --> 20:03.620
Of all the timelines,
this is clearly the darkest,

20:03.655 --> 20:05.441
which is why I propose
we commit to being evil.

20:05.475 --> 20:07.228
I made us all black goatees
out of felt.

20:07.263 --> 20:10.498
I suggest you put them on until
you're able to grow your own.

20:10.516 --> 20:13.128
From now on, I am evil Abed.

20:13.163 --> 20:16.129
We're the evil study group,
and we have but one evil goal.

20:16.164 --> 20:18.355
Return somehow
to the prime timeline,

20:18.389 --> 20:19.905
the one that I stopped you
from rolling that die,

20:19.940 --> 20:21.557
then we destroy
the good versions of ourselves,

20:21.592 --> 20:23.985
and reclaim our proper lives.

20:24.019 --> 20:25.839
- Evil Abed.
- Mm-hm?

20:25.874 --> 20:29.043
As evil Jeff, am I allowed
to pull fewer punches with you?

20:29.077 --> 20:31.116
- Certainly.
- I hate you!

20:31.168 --> 20:32.718
Shut up
with your Sci-Fi crap!

20:32.752 --> 20:35.145
I lost my damn arm,

20:35.180 --> 20:36.932
and you're making fake beards!

20:36.967 --> 20:38.651
Goatees.

20:49.509 --> 20:53.251
♪evil Troy
and evil Abed ♪

21:00.029 --> 21:01.747
What's wrong?

21:01.782 --> 21:04.816
I don't know.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.592
I guess nothing.
