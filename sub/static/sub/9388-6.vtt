<i>We now return to Rodney King of Queens.</i>

00:35.903 --> 00:39.614
- Rodney, did you take out the trash?
- Um, I forgot.

00:42.093 --> 00:44.007
Oh, no she di-in't.

00:45.405 --> 00:46.903
Pizza for Adam West.

00:47.001 --> 00:50.897
No. You gave me Canadian bacon
instead of bacon?

00:50.898 --> 00:53.708
This misdeed cannot go unpunished.

00:53.706 --> 00:59.580
Pizza delivery man, prepare to meet your
maker at the hands of my cat launcher.

01:18.152 --> 01:21.733
Hey, look, somebody tried to break
into the dirty movie store.

01:21.730 --> 01:24.686
Quick, grab as many as you can
before someone sees us.

01:26.569 --> 01:28.105
Damn, I lost him.

01:28.119 --> 01:31.003
All right, cats, back in the bag.
Come on, Fluffy.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.552
Come on, Mittens. Come on, Paul.

01:33.606 --> 01:37.511
What a ridiculous name for a cat.

01:37.595 --> 01:41.053
Paul! That's a person's name.

01:41.086 --> 01:43.482
A person's name.

01:45.265 --> 01:46.790
Oh, Paul.

01:49.798 --> 01:51.903
Oh, man, this is going to be great.

01:51.906 --> 01:54.752
- Oh, are we watching a movie?
- The lab results are back.

01:54.758 --> 01:57.280
You've tested positive for nymphomania.

01:57.288 --> 01:59.231
Oh, no, what should I do?

01:59.236 --> 02:01.852
Take two of these and call us
in the morning.

02:02.958 --> 02:05.461
Oh, now that's not going
to help her nymphomania.

02:05.468 --> 02:07.312
It's only going to exacerbate it.

02:07.786 --> 02:11.283
Oh, my God, what are you kids doing?
Out. Everybody out.

02:12.545 --> 02:13.683
That's bogus.

02:13.918 --> 02:17.102
- Chris, what is this?
- Genital Hospital.

02:17.107 --> 02:19.902
Yes, and it's inappropriate
for someone your age.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.972
Now, if you're curious about sex,
you should talk to your sex ed teacher.

02:22.975 --> 02:26.793
We don't have one. The principal
cut sex ed class to save money.

02:26.796 --> 02:29.121
What? Well, that's crazy.

02:29.125 --> 02:32.373
Without sex ed, kids can wind up
sexually confused.

02:32.375 --> 02:34.302
Just look at Michael Jackson.

02:34.336 --> 02:36.383
The kid in me likes the frosted side...

02:36.387 --> 02:38.821
but the grown-up in me
likes the kid in me.

02:39.935 --> 02:43.151
Peter, do you know they're not teaching
sex ed at Chris' school?

02:43.166 --> 02:45.380
Eh, let them figure it out the way
I had to.

02:45.386 --> 02:49.040
With a can of Crisco and a shot glass.
That's the natural way, Lois.

02:49.045 --> 02:50.363
That's the natural way.

02:50.366 --> 02:52.192
Well, somebody's got to step in.

02:52.198 --> 02:54.221
Tomorrow, I'm going down to
James Woods High

02:54.237 --> 02:55.961
and offer to teach the class myself.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.780
Hey, you could really make a difference.

02:57.788 --> 03:00.572
Like I did when I taught money
management to those drug addicts.

03:00.588 --> 03:02.580
There's a lot of ways for you guys
to save money.

03:02.586 --> 03:05.652
For example, you're all shooting up,
why not share needles?

03:05.656 --> 03:09.152
That's a no-brainer. More money in
your wallet, more drugs in your veins.

03:09.156 --> 03:12.682
My second piece of advice :
have as many kids as you can,

03:12.685 --> 03:15.531
'cause that makes it more likely
that one of those kids'll grow up

03:15.538 --> 03:17.990
and make it big in Hollywood.

03:18.145 --> 03:20.223
Then who's paying the bills, eh?

03:20.506 --> 03:22.210
Hollywood kid.

03:22.515 --> 03:23.653
Class dismissed.

03:27.157 --> 03:28.793
Good morning, everyone.

03:28.795 --> 03:31.812
I'm Mrs. Griffin,
your new sex ed teacher.

03:31.815 --> 03:34.003
Now, you've probably heard all those rumors

03:34.006 --> 03:36.312
that condoms make sex less pleasurable.

03:36.316 --> 03:39.692
While that is a fact,
they also make sex safer.

03:39.706 --> 03:40.942
Sorry I'm late, Lois.

03:40.945 --> 03:42.440
Peter, what are you doing here?

03:42.448 --> 03:44.550
Lois, you think I'm going
to miss a chance to share

03:44.555 --> 03:46.313
my knowledge with these
fresh young minds?

03:46.316 --> 03:48.653
Forget it, I've missed too many
other opportunities.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.693
- There he is.
- Took you long enough.

03:50.707 --> 03:53.443
- Just what we need.
- Hey, guys, I'm coming in.

03:53.808 --> 03:55.972
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

03:55.977 --> 03:58.721
Oh, boy.
I am not going to hear the end of this.

03:58.727 --> 04:00.203
- You jackass.
- Now you've done it.

04:00.207 --> 04:01.083
Idiot.

04:01.087 --> 04:04.501
I know I don't fit here,
but I'm just going to settle right in.

04:04.618 --> 04:08.192
All right, Peter, you can stay,
but remember, this is my class.

04:08.197 --> 04:11.952
Now, there are a number of natural ways
that males and females interact.

04:11.958 --> 04:13.942
That's right, allow me to demonstrate.

04:13.948 --> 04:16.890
Hey, Rainbow Brite.
Hello, Shakespeare.

04:16.896 --> 04:19.720
I am all done writing plays for the day,

04:19.725 --> 04:22.342
perhaps we could have sexual intercourse?

04:22.447 --> 04:23.773
Count me in.

04:30.858 --> 04:34.022
I say, look at this.
This toy has small parts.

04:34.026 --> 04:36.680
Why the devil would they include
small parts?

04:36.686 --> 04:37.612
Unless...

04:37.618 --> 04:40.770
I'm supposed to eat them.
Of course, it all adds up!

04:42.057 --> 04:44.303
Oh, dear God, I've lost a tooth.

04:44.308 --> 04:45.643
Dude, you're lucky.

04:45.648 --> 04:47.252
If you put that under your pillow,

04:47.258 --> 04:49.582
the  Tooth Fairy will come
and give you a dollar.

04:49.585 --> 04:52.353
What?
Did you say the Tooth Fairy comes here?

04:52.358 --> 04:55.543
To our house?
She just breaks in like some hood?

04:55.548 --> 04:59.092
Yeah, she creeps into your house at night
and comes into your room while you sleep.

04:59.098 --> 05:00.070
Oh, my God!

05:00.078 --> 05:01.851
And sometimes, just for the hell of it,

05:01.857 --> 05:04.303
she cuts off a piece of her armpit hair

05:04.305 --> 05:06.331
and places it gently on your tongue.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.253
Oh, oh, God! Oh, God, I got to get
out of here! I got to get out of here!

05:09.258 --> 05:10.983
Stewie, calm down.
Get a hold of yourself.

05:10.985 --> 05:12.493
Here, Brian, let me handle this.

05:12.498 --> 05:15.242
Calm down.
Everything's going to be all right.

05:15.246 --> 05:16.752
Chris, you're wanted on the phone.

05:16.758 --> 05:19.170
Everything's going to be all right.

05:27.296 --> 05:29.713
Hey, Lois, I wanted to get some K-Y Jelly

05:29.717 --> 05:32.521
for the class today, but they were
all out so I got Smucker's.

05:32.528 --> 05:34.263
Peter, I don't know
what you think you're doing,

05:34.268 --> 05:37.670
but you ruined my sex ed class. There's
no way you're coming with me again.

05:37.677 --> 05:38.352
Fine,

05:38.356 --> 05:41.592
but without my advice, those kids are
going to be as hopeless as Liam Neeson

05:41.597 --> 05:43.543
when he tries to play an
American cowboy.

05:43.545 --> 05:45.981
But, Montana, when will you be back?

05:45.987 --> 05:49.721
That's none of your concern.
You got to take care of the offspring.

05:49.736 --> 05:54.180
Gonna take a fortnight at least to get
this herd down to St. Louis on Mississippi.

05:54.196 --> 05:56.332
This glen's gonna be tough to traverse,

05:56.335 --> 05:59.650
and that river's got to be 50,
60 meters wide.

05:59.655 --> 06:01.492
And God knows how many fathoms. 

06:01.498 --> 06:05.260
To hell with parliamentary procedure.
We've got to wrangle up some cattles.

06:08.166 --> 06:09.802
What is going on here?

06:09.806 --> 06:13.110
We're all protesting the sex ed class
that's being taught to our children.

06:13.118 --> 06:15.330
Mrs. Griffin, I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,

06:15.336 --> 06:18.571
but the school board has voted
to cancel your sex ed class.

06:18.577 --> 06:22.013
Look, Principal Shepherd, I know
my husband acted inappropriately...

06:22.016 --> 06:23.572
Oh, it's not because of your husband.

06:23.577 --> 06:26.673
It's because you're teaching those kids
about condoms.

06:26.717 --> 06:29.633
What? That's ridiculous.

06:29.668 --> 06:33.023
These  students have the
right to information about safe sex.

06:33.035 --> 06:35.121
Well, these parents don't think so.

06:35.127 --> 06:37.543
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin. You're fired.

06:37.607 --> 06:39.800
Fired?! Oh, no.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.701
I can't believe they fired you.

06:48.707 --> 06:50.823
Can't you go down the school
and try to reason with them?

06:50.827 --> 06:53.083
No, I'm banned from school property.

06:53.097 --> 06:55.333
The PTA doesn't want me around
their children.

06:55.337 --> 06:57.020
Well, Lois, I think you did
the right thing

06:57.027 --> 06:59.261
by trying to inform these kids
about safe sex.

06:59.266 --> 07:01.662
And if the parents don't like it,
that's their loss.

07:01.665 --> 07:05.483
That's the problem, though.
It isn't their loss, it's the kids' loss.

07:05.488 --> 07:08.102
I just hope they're getting
the information they need.

07:09.408 --> 07:11.962
All right, students,
we have a special speaker today

07:11.968 --> 07:13.743
who's going to educate you about sex.

07:13.756 --> 07:16.510
Please welcome from the
First Evangelical Church,

07:16.548 --> 07:19.600
the Reverend Jerry Kirkwood
and the Opal Ring Crusade.

07:19.607 --> 07:22.870
Hey, kids, put your Walkmans down
and listen up.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.183
'Cause we're going to talk about sex.

07:25.185 --> 07:27.982
<i>Sex? Hang on there, Jerry.</i>

07:27.985 --> 07:30.340
God, what are you doing here?

07:30.352 --> 07:33.823
<i>I was just passing through on my way
to see The Matrix.</i>

07:34.400 --> 07:36.456
- We can relate to that.
- No fake.

07:36.459 --> 07:40.045
Well, God, I am here to talk to
these kids about sex.

07:40.049 --> 07:41.523
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

07:41.528 --> 07:43.610
And why they shouldn't be having it.

07:43.616 --> 07:44.950
<i>That is boss.</i>

07:44.957 --> 07:47.070
Hey, you kids like Mad TV?

07:47.075 --> 07:49.473
Well, we've got something almost as good.

07:49.475 --> 07:52.341
Here they are... The Opal Ring Players.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.330
Boy, I sure had fun
at the pizza parlor tonight, Debbie.

07:55.347 --> 07:58.233
Yeah, Matthew,
that pizza pie was delicious.

07:58.235 --> 08:00.140
Hey, watch out, crazy driver.

08:00.145 --> 08:02.323
That joker must have been
from Jefferson High.

08:03.007 --> 08:04.161
They're our rivals.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.733
Well, here we are at the make-out point.

08:06.738 --> 08:08.882
Yeah. You want to go all the way?

08:08.886 --> 08:12.682
Freeze! Now, who can tell me
what Matthew just did wrong?

08:12.716 --> 08:16.082
I mean, besides not running over
that yahoo from Jefferson High.

08:16.778 --> 08:17.903
They're our rivals.

08:17.907 --> 08:20.880
He's wrong 'cause he wants to have sex
and he's not married.

08:20.888 --> 08:23.232
- Bingo.
- Wow, you're pretty smart.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.723
- Thanks. My name's Doug.
- I'm Meg.

08:30.545 --> 08:32.902
Now, look, let's rap for a second.

08:32.905 --> 08:35.662
He's sitting informally like us.
Let's hear what he has to say.

08:35.677 --> 08:37.051
Jefferson High is our rival.

08:37.058 --> 08:41.011
Sure, sex if fun, but you can't have it
before you're married,

08:41.025 --> 08:42.852
even if you use a condom.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.190
Because not only to condoms fail
100% of the time,

08:46.198 --> 08:48.383
they're also majorly unsafe.

08:48.386 --> 08:52.320
Hey, you wouldn't put a plastic bag
over your grandmother's head, would you?

08:52.335 --> 08:53.310
No.

08:53.328 --> 08:56.292
And that's why we're gonna be
handing out these opal rings.

08:56.295 --> 08:58.472
These rings are a symbol of
your commitment

08:58.478 --> 09:00.702
to refrain from sex until you're married.

09:00.716 --> 09:02.850
So what do you say?
Who wants to be joyful?

09:02.856 --> 09:06.800
Who wants to be pure?
Who wants to be... abstinent?

09:08.896 --> 09:13.103
- Wow, he makes so much sense.
- I know, he's a visionary,

09:13.118 --> 09:15.773
like Gandhi or Mozart or Picasso.

09:15.778 --> 09:18.382
Ladies and gentlemen, my newest work.

09:18.387 --> 09:20.372
Now, I know this person looks
a little mixed up,

09:20.377 --> 09:23.261
but, watch carefully.
If I move this down here,

09:23.276 --> 09:25.131
and this over here,

09:25.278 --> 09:27.362
and this part here...

09:27.477 --> 09:29.571
Anyone tell who it is yet?
No?

09:29.638 --> 09:33.543
Okay, well, what if I move this here
and this here...

09:33.716 --> 09:35.460
Then it's Dianne Wiest.

09:38.426 --> 09:40.922
All right, men, your mission tonight
is to stave off

09:40.927 --> 09:42.782
the invading forces of the Tooth Fairy.

09:42.787 --> 09:44.523
SpongeBob, you watch the East.

09:44.526 --> 09:46.310
StarScream, you take the West.

09:46.318 --> 09:50.230
And  Man-E-Faces, you take center patrol
since you have many faces.

09:56.858 --> 09:59.172
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's morning.

09:59.225 --> 10:00.162
Is it?

10:00.166 --> 10:02.290
Ha! I knew it! I scared her off. 

10:02.298 --> 10:04.471
Uh, you might want to check
under your pillow.

10:05.575 --> 10:06.883
How did she get in?

10:06.886 --> 10:09.752
She must have been quieter than
Britney Spears' dietician.

10:10.508 --> 10:12.870
Ea-Easy on those trans fats.

10:13.727 --> 10:16.191
N-Not everything needs gravy.

10:16.916 --> 10:20.303
You know, there's some carrots
down at the other end.

10:21.565 --> 10:24.433
That-that cheesecake was for everyone.

10:24.437 --> 10:26.633
Her  hand was right beneath my pillow.

10:26.638 --> 10:28.832
She  could have snapped my neck
if she had a mind to.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.790
Don't worry about it. I'm sure it will be
a while before you lose another tooth.

10:31.807 --> 10:32.882
I can't wait for that.

10:32.885 --> 10:36.191
I have to lure her back on my terms
and kill her myself!

10:36.308 --> 10:39.680
But to catch a fairy,
I have to think like a fairy.

10:40.156 --> 10:43.312

11:01.388 --> 11:03.342
Arriba!

11:06.717 --> 11:08.951
<i>We now return to Laguna Beach.</i>

11:08.955 --> 11:10.402
- Like, right?
- I know.

11:10.407 --> 11:12.503
- Whatever, because "duh!"
- I know, right?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.942
Whatever, because I mean,
like, totally full out.

11:14.947 --> 11:16.360
- Full on.
- Right?

11:16.367 --> 11:18.823
I guess it's not easy growing up
anywhere.

11:18.826 --> 11:22.960
Hey, Dad, check out my abstinence ring.
It means I made a pledge not to have sex.

11:22.975 --> 11:26.313
That's crazy! You can't give up sex.
You've got a responsibility.

11:26.317 --> 11:29.221
You see, Meg, you're what they call
a "practice girl."

11:29.228 --> 11:31.830
Dad, look at the facts about sex.

11:31.927 --> 11:36.320
"If you have sex, your penis will fall
off and land in another dimension"

11:36.327 --> 11:39.483
"populated entirely by dogs
who will eat it."

11:39.486 --> 11:43.000
Well, that's something I'd like to avoid.
Well, this changes everything.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.571
From now on, I, too, will be obstinate.

11:45.578 --> 11:46.920
- Abstinent.
- Absinthe.

11:46.925 --> 11:48.523
- Abstinent.
- You're grounded.

11:50.467 --> 11:52.131
All right, getting a tooth to lure

11:52.136 --> 11:54.612
that damn fairy back shouldn't be
too difficult.

12:05.228 --> 12:08.030
I'd love to dance, Fred Savage.

12:14.025 --> 12:17.763
Gosh, Meg, I really wish we could take
our relationship to the next level.

12:17.776 --> 12:21.871
I know, I feel the same way,
but we made a decision to be abstinent.

12:21.888 --> 12:25.360
Of course, there are ways
we could keep our pledge

12:25.368 --> 12:27.592
and still do other things.

12:27.605 --> 12:30.483
You're right.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

12:30.488 --> 12:31.513
Uh-huh.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.231
Oh, there it is. I see it.

12:34.235 --> 12:37.143
You know, Roy, I hope you play
squash better than you pass.

12:37.155 --> 12:38.991
Well, we'll find out this Saturday.

12:43.505 --> 12:46.811
All right, Peter,
you ready for role-playing night?

12:46.815 --> 12:51.350
Here comes, Grimace.
You got some burgers I can steal, huh?

12:51.358 --> 12:53.782
Lois, the Hamburglar steals hamburgers.

12:53.788 --> 12:56.341
Grimace is
Ronald McDonald's autistic friend.

12:56.346 --> 13:00.270
Oh, come on, you love the
dirty-talking Grimace.

13:00.276 --> 13:02.351
You... Peter, what the hell is this?

13:02.355 --> 13:05.113
- My chastity belt.
- A chastity belt?

13:05.116 --> 13:08.261
- What in God's name is that for?
- I'm abstinent, Lois.

13:08.268 --> 13:10.561
It's all in these pamphlets
Meg brought home from school.

13:10.565 --> 13:13.391
Sex turns straight people gay
and turn gays into Mexicans.

13:13.407 --> 13:15.070
Everyone goes down a notch.

13:15.086 --> 13:18.190
This is nonsense.
You can't force abstinence on kids.

13:18.206 --> 13:20.860
Lois, what possible harm
can abstinence do?

13:20.866 --> 13:23.161
Meg Griffin, we need to have a talk.

13:23.755 --> 13:24.851
Mom!

13:25.495 --> 13:27.900
Oh, my God!

13:28.026 --> 13:29.840
You kids were doing it...

13:29.848 --> 13:31.333
in the ear!

13:31.338 --> 13:34.060
Hey, my sandwich tastes funny. Is there
something wrong with the Smucker's?

13:34.065 --> 13:35.860
Yeah, it's been on my crotch.

13:39.076 --> 13:42.460
Meg, I still cannot believe
what you and Doug did last night.

13:42.476 --> 13:45.720
Mom, you don't understand.
Doug and I are abstinent,

13:45.726 --> 13:48.193
but if we have sex in the ear,
it doesn't count.

13:48.197 --> 13:50.600
We're still pure in the eyes of the Lord.

13:50.607 --> 13:53.893
Meg, when I was your age,
my parents tried to feed me

13:53.897 --> 13:57.640
the same nonsense about premarital sex.
You're lying to yourself.

13:57.645 --> 13:59.202
Well, I don't care what you think!

13:59.215 --> 14:01.561
Doug and I are part of the
Opal Ring Crusade,

14:01.565 --> 14:03.530
and this is how we choose
to express our love.

14:03.536 --> 14:07.070
Look, Meg,
A) ear sex is just unnatural,

14:07.086 --> 14:09.482
and B)...
How do I say this?

14:09.486 --> 14:12.251
Vaginal intercourse is...

14:12.756 --> 14:14.873
it's just tops.

14:14.876 --> 14:17.162
It's the bee's knees, Meg.

14:17.165 --> 14:20.140
Oh, when you rattle it around
just right...

14:20.146 --> 14:21.741
oh, my God!

14:21.748 --> 14:24.751
I mean, you remember when we had
that old car with the bad shocks

14:24.756 --> 14:27.492
and I used to take the old dirt road
on purpose?

14:27.496 --> 14:29.422
Meg... Meg?

14:30.178 --> 14:31.433
I love you.

14:35.147 --> 14:38.921
In local news, a sexy new trend
has emerged at James Woods High.

14:38.926 --> 14:42.783
That's right, Tom. It appears that
students have taken to having ear sex

14:42.785 --> 14:44.561
in lieu of traditional intercourse.

14:44.575 --> 14:47.932
Over 200 reports of ear sex
have been confirmed so far,

14:47.936 --> 14:50.432
prompting a new slogan :
"Once you go black,"

14:50.438 --> 14:51.583
"you go deaf."

14:51.766 --> 14:54.772
Brian, I'll be right back.
I'm going to use the little girl's room.

14:54.776 --> 14:55.902
All right, baby.

14:57.836 --> 15:00.113
An entire week and still no teeth.

15:00.116 --> 15:03.191
And it turns out these teeth I got
from the old man are phony.

15:03.195 --> 15:05.732
Brian, Brian, look, I'm Gary Busey.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.643
I'm frequently aggressive
in situations that don't call for it.

15:11.557 --> 15:14.712
- What the hell is that?
- Ah, it's Jillian. She's, uh...

15:14.808 --> 15:17.571
she has this eating disorder.
She's bulimic.

15:17.576 --> 15:20.220
- My God, that's horrible!
- I know, it really is.

15:20.225 --> 15:23.500
I mean, her hair is falling out.
Last week she lost a tooth.

15:23.507 --> 15:24.331
Really?

15:24.336 --> 15:29.111
But man, I'll tell ya, all that purging
just makes her body look fantastic.

15:29.248 --> 15:31.242
I mean, that's what the supermodels do.

15:31.326 --> 15:34.201
And so many of them just look so great.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.831
Karen Carpenter over did it,

15:37.836 --> 15:39.983
but I think Jillian's found
a good balance.

15:42.527 --> 15:45.630
I'm really surprised
you invited me out for dinner, Stevie.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.411
Oh, well, you know, I just wanted
to touch base, see how everything's...

15:48.415 --> 15:49.442
It's "Stewie," by the way.

15:49.445 --> 15:52.703
Just to check in, make sure everything's
going well with you and Brian.

15:52.707 --> 15:54.492
It's going kickass!

15:54.496 --> 15:56.361
Well, you look fantastic.

15:56.365 --> 15:58.752
Got some meat on your bones,
which is great.

15:58.756 --> 16:00.693
- What?
- Just saying you look jolly,

16:00.696 --> 16:03.733
like Ruben Studdard
or John Goodman or Santa.

16:03.735 --> 16:06.591
Oh, my God. Are you saying I'm fat?

16:06.595 --> 16:09.490
No, I'm saying Santa's thin.
Get in there and throw up!

16:11.025 --> 16:13.900
Excellent. Now I'm prepared
to fight the Tooth Fairy

16:13.917 --> 16:17.010
just like Gerri fought comedy
on The Facts of Life.

16:17.027 --> 16:19.273
Hey, Blair, did you find
a purse at the mall?

16:19.278 --> 16:21.340
Actually, I found seven.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.162
One for every day of the week.

16:30.347 --> 16:32.561
I'm wide awake, Peter.

16:32.568 --> 16:36.410
- You want to mess around?
- Lois, you know I'm abstinent.

16:36.418 --> 16:39.800
Come on. Can't you break
your stupid pledge for one night?

16:39.806 --> 16:42.551
Well, I guess we do both have needs.

16:44.386 --> 16:45.981
Peter.

16:47.896 --> 16:51.002
Wh-What are you doing? What?
Peter, what are you doing to my ear?!

16:51.006 --> 16:52.411
Get off of me!

16:52.415 --> 16:54.240
What the hell is wrong with you?!

16:54.248 --> 16:56.360
This is all I can do, Lois.
I'm abstinent.

16:56.367 --> 16:57.480
That is it.

16:57.487 --> 17:00.551
I am going to have regular sex with you
whether you like it or not.

17:00.557 --> 17:01.132
No!

17:01.135 --> 17:03.752
I wasn't asking your permission.

17:05.846 --> 17:07.973
No, no, no! I'm abstinent!

17:07.977 --> 17:09.650
This is an affront to the Lord!

17:09.656 --> 17:10.742
No!

17:10.785 --> 17:12.001
No!

17:14.066 --> 17:15.313
No!

17:16.595 --> 17:18.473
Oh, I see what you're driving at.

17:20.605 --> 17:22.490
Oh, that was fantastic.

17:22.498 --> 17:24.590
Hey, when'd you get that tattoo
on your lower back?

17:24.596 --> 17:26.902
I don't know, Peter.
Meth is a hell of a drug.

17:26.906 --> 17:27.372
What?

17:27.376 --> 17:29.510
I'm just glad to have you back
on my side.

17:29.525 --> 17:32.530
I only wish I could convince Meg
and her classmates, too.

17:32.538 --> 17:34.103
We'll show 'em somehow, Lois.

17:34.106 --> 17:37.592
I'll be more convincing than Mel Gibson
when he apologized to the Jews.

17:37.627 --> 17:41.302
I'm really, really sorry about
your big noses.

17:41.347 --> 17:44.341
I'm really sorry about how
greedy you are.

17:44.377 --> 17:47.950
But most of all, I'm really sorry
about your dirty,

17:47.957 --> 17:50.363
underhanded, backstabbing ways.

17:50.367 --> 17:53.543
Your number-one dirty Jew fan,
Mel Gibson.

17:57.875 --> 18:00.863
All right, Tooth Whore, do your worst.

18:04.507 --> 18:06.700
Stewie, what the hell?
Get me down from here.

18:06.705 --> 18:09.611
No, way, man! How do I know
you're not the Tooth Fairy in disguise?

18:09.618 --> 18:11.262
- Your middle name is Gilligan.
- Not good enough!

18:11.266 --> 18:13.350
- You think my girlfriend's a moron.
- So does everyone!

18:13.355 --> 18:15.231
You have a picture of Chris Noth
in your wallet.

18:15.247 --> 18:15.812
Okay.

18:16.785 --> 18:19.673
Stewie, this is ridiculous.
There's something I have to tell you.

18:19.677 --> 18:21.832
The Tooth Fairy isn't real.

18:21.835 --> 18:22.691
What?!

18:22.698 --> 18:25.762
Look, I didn't want to burst your
bubble since you're just a kid, but,

18:25.768 --> 18:27.651
yeah, she's all smoke and mirrors

18:27.667 --> 18:29.101
just like Harry Houdini.

18:29.105 --> 18:31.681
But I don't want to play bridge
with the Petersons tonight.

18:31.698 --> 18:34.372
Harry, we agreed weeks ago,
and we're going.

18:34.378 --> 18:36.543
All right, fine, let me get my coat.

18:37.976 --> 18:40.003
Oh, wait a second!

18:40.368 --> 18:43.023
Damn it! I am not going by myself!

18:43.115 --> 18:44.391
Ah, you bitch.

18:44.626 --> 18:45.923
Oh, very well then.

18:45.926 --> 18:49.591
I suppose that bile-spewing skirt
of yours can have her tooth back.

18:52.878 --> 18:54.552
What? It's gone!

18:54.558 --> 18:56.642
Whoa, I wonder what happened to it?

19:14.207 --> 19:16.602
Peter, how are we going to get
past the guard?

19:16.605 --> 19:19.850
Lois, I think I just got an idea.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.773
You see that guy with the overcoat?

19:23.776 --> 19:26.510
He's tall enough for us to
sneakin behind him. Come on!

19:26.517 --> 19:30.282
So remember, sex is bad, immoral,
and wrong.

19:30.287 --> 19:33.563
And if you have sex,
you're automatically in Al Qaeda.

19:33.847 --> 19:36.373
Kids, do not listen to this man. 

19:36.377 --> 19:39.233
He is wrong, he is feeding you lies.

19:39.235 --> 19:43.511
Now, look, it's true. You shouldn't
have sex until you're ready.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.971
You should wait until you're in love.

19:46.196 --> 19:48.821
But I mean, hey, we're all human, huh?

19:48.827 --> 19:52.313
We have urges,
and they are perfectly natural.

19:52.345 --> 19:55.380
And if you do make the choice
to act on them,

19:55.386 --> 19:58.082
make sure you protect yourselves,

19:58.087 --> 19:59.613
use  a condom.

20:00.855 --> 20:03.002
- I'm going to use condoms.
- Me, too!

20:03.017 --> 20:05.262
Maybe I'll use two condoms
at the same time.

20:05.265 --> 20:07.812
- Why would you do that?
- Oh, I mean, just one, just one.

20:07.818 --> 20:09.781
Doug, my mom's right.

20:09.807 --> 20:13.163
If we really care about each other,
it's okay to have sex.

20:13.177 --> 20:15.770
We'll be safe. We'll use a condom,

20:15.777 --> 20:17.392
and it'll be wonderful.

20:17.395 --> 20:19.723
Wow! Does this mean I'll see you naked?

20:19.726 --> 20:22.112
- Yeah.
- Oh, boy, I can't wait.

20:22.148 --> 20:25.903
- I'm sorry Doug dumped you, honey.
- It's all your fault!

20:27.555 --> 20:29.903
- I'm proud of you, sweetheart.
- Me, too, Lois.

20:29.907 --> 20:31.603
You stood up for what you believe in.

20:31.607 --> 20:33.972
I just wish I could have been there
to hear the speech you made.

20:33.977 --> 20:35.663
You think you could give me
a little taste?

20:35.668 --> 20:39.353
