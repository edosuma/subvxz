WEBVTT

01:10.612 --> 01:13.698
-Nothing in that right front pocket, Tim?
-No, empty, Brian.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.374
<i>Fifty-year-old Troy Burress</i>

02:04.457 --> 02:07.335
<i>worked as a truck driver</i>
<i>for a Florida sausage company.</i>

02:07.418 --> 02:10.588
<i>He had planned on quitting his job</i>
<i>because he hated life on the road.</i>

02:11.381 --> 02:13.216
<i>Burress was found shot in the head.</i>

05:53.478 --> 05:57.482
<i>Charles Humphreys was</i>
<i>a 56-year-old former Alabama police chief.</i>

05:57.565 --> 06:00.193
<i>A man who was considered</i>
<i>anything but naive.</i>

06:00.276 --> 06:02.528
<i>They took away someone who loved life.</i>

06:04.489 --> 06:07.533
<i>And, of course, the big part of my life.</i>

08:13.409 --> 08:16.078
One was kind of short and really heavyset.

08:16.162 --> 08:19.874
The other was kind of taller with blond--
A little shoulder-length blond hair.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.043
They took off
from the church in the woods.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.810
The information that we've received,
there were a variety of scenarios.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.524
We don't know that at this point.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.991
<i>Police say,</i>
<i>for the first time in criminal history,</i>

13:04.074 --> 13:06.869
<i>these killers may be murdering</i>
<i>with a feminine touch.</i>

13:07.536 --> 13:10.206
<i>The main suspects are two young women</i>

13:10.289 --> 13:12.833
<i>who play damsels in distress</i>
<i>along the roadway</i>

13:12.917 --> 13:14.502
<i>and then become dames of doom.</i>

13:15.211 --> 13:20.633
<i>We don't know how the suspects</i>
<i>are getting close enough to our victims</i>

13:20.716 --> 13:21.926
<i>to, uh…</i>

13:23.177 --> 13:26.639
<i>break down the natural tendency</i>
<i>to be wary of strangers.</i>

13:26.722 --> 13:30.476
<i>She may be offering, uh, a sexual favor</i>

13:30.559 --> 13:33.020
<i>or asking for some sort of assistance.</i>

13:33.103 --> 13:36.273
<i> Florida drivers</i>
<i>aren't stopping for anyone,</i>

13:36.357 --> 13:38.609
<i>especially female hitchhikers.</i>

13:39.068 --> 13:41.695
<i>It's just scary, in a way,</i> <i>because, uh--</i>

13:41.779 --> 13:43.948
<i>Knowing somebody's</i>
<i>doing something like that.</i>

13:44.657 --> 13:46.450
<i>I get all these white hairs carrying a gun</i>

13:46.534 --> 13:48.953
<i>hoping nobody catches me with it</i>
<i>and put me in jail.</i>

13:49.578 --> 13:52.915
<i>I'd rather have the sheriff</i>
<i>here in this county catch me with it</i>

13:52.998 --> 13:54.834
<i>than two women catch me without it.</i>

24:32.554 --> 24:34.806
-
- <i>Let me know you hear me.</i>

24:36.099 --> 24:37.184
<i>-You hear me?</i>
- <i>Yep.</i>

24:37.684 --> 24:38.935
<i> Okay, bud.</i>

24:56.036 --> 24:57.913
-
- <i>Grab me a beer.</i>

25:09.633 --> 25:12.719
<i>Yeah, I'd definitely like</i>
<i>to get in contact with you and all.</i>

25:12.802 --> 25:14.304
<i>You're my type.</i>

25:23.355 --> 25:26.733
<i>It's just that,</i>
<i>you know, I am so fucked up,</i>

25:27.234 --> 25:30.153
-<i>and so hurt that--</i>
- <i>Why you hurting so bad?</i>

25:30.237 --> 25:31.863
-
-<i>What's wrong?</i>

25:32.739 --> 25:36.535
<i>I lost somebody</i>
<i>I was in love for five years… with.</i>

25:37.452 --> 25:39.454
<i>Run off</i>
<i>and left you or something?</i>

25:39.538 --> 25:40.372
<i>Yep.</i>

25:48.213 --> 25:50.006
<i>How long</i>
<i>y'all been broke up?</i>

25:51.925 --> 25:55.053
- <i>Two weeks. You want it?</i>
-<i> That's hard.</i>

25:57.138 --> 25:59.349
<i>But the thing about it,</i>
<i>you come into this world,</i>

25:59.432 --> 26:01.518
<i>you had nothing</i>
<i>but a naked ass and not a dime,</i>

26:01.601 --> 26:02.894
<i>and you made it, didn't you?</i>

26:03.562 --> 26:04.396
<i>-Huh?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

26:04.479 --> 26:06.773
<i>All right.</i>
<i>By God, you can do it again, then.</i>

26:55.530 --> 26:57.616
Hey,
if you hear me, she wants to walk.

26:58.658 --> 27:01.077
Blow the horn if you hear me.
She wants to walk now.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.121
-
-Okay, buddy.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.499
We're gonna try
to get her outside first, right?

27:07.751 --> 27:09.294
All right, is everybody ready?

27:17.302 --> 27:18.553
Come here, baby!

27:33.693 --> 27:36.613
Sheriff's department, Volusia County.
Step over there a minute.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.199
What's your name, pal?

27:39.908 --> 27:40.742
Hey.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.328
My name's Jones, man. What's wrong?

27:43.411 --> 27:45.830
My name is investigator Horzepa
with the sheriff's office.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.749
-Volusia County Warrants Division.
-Yeah?

27:47.832 --> 27:50.001
-Can I see some ID?
-I ain't got none, man.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.300
-Let me see some ID.
-I ain't got no identification.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.218
Let me see some--

27:58.301 --> 28:00.512
I ain't got
no fucking identification!

28:00.595 --> 28:01.805
I ain't got none!

28:01.888 --> 28:03.723
I ain't got no fucking felony, man!

28:09.437 --> 28:13.358
I wanna know
what the hell is going on here.

28:13.983 --> 28:16.069
-I'll tell you, you're under arrest.
-For what?

28:16.152 --> 28:18.113
-For a warrant!
-For what warrant?

28:18.196 --> 28:19.072
A warrant!

28:20.532 --> 28:23.118
Four years ago,
you didn't show up to court.

28:32.752 --> 28:34.879
- What's going on, girl?
-I don't know!

28:34.963 --> 28:37.298
What do they mean
by a warrant?

28:37.799 --> 28:38.883
I have no idea.

28:38.967 --> 28:42.345
Honey, you're probably one
of these little undercover suckers that…

28:43.388 --> 28:46.433
Doing some kind of shit
that I don't know what's going on and…

28:46.516 --> 28:48.143
-Who you talking about?
-You ain't--

28:48.226 --> 28:51.187
-Who the fuck you talking about?
-I don't know what's going on!

28:51.271 --> 28:53.648
I don't know
what the fuck's going on either!

28:53.732 --> 28:54.899
Neither do I!

29:05.618 --> 29:08.872
-You don't even remember me, do you?
- Yeah, I do.

30:14.437 --> 30:17.190
<i>Okay, first of all,</i>
<i>how do you know Aileen?</i>

30:17.273 --> 30:23.530
Um,<i> </i>I met her in a gay bar
in South Daytona in June of 1986.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.533
We lived together for four years,

30:26.616 --> 30:32.455
and started out as lovers,
and later we were just like sisters more.

30:39.712 --> 30:42.799
<i>She came home one morning</i>
<i>with a two-door Cadillac.</i>

30:42.882 --> 30:45.134
<i>Now, this would have been when?</i>

30:45.218 --> 30:47.804
In December of '89.

30:47.887 --> 30:49.973
We were sitting on the living room floor,

30:50.056 --> 30:52.851
and she openly confessed

30:52.934 --> 30:55.562
that she had shot
and killed a man that day.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.951
And, at first, I didn't believe her.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.912
'Cause she lies about a lot of things.

31:12.996 --> 31:16.499
But I saw it
about a week later on the news.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.376
-I heard.
- You heard…

32:58.893 --> 33:00.186
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

33:00.269 --> 33:02.438
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>
<i>They've called.</i>

33:02.522 --> 33:04.399
<i>They've been up to my parents' again.</i>

33:04.899 --> 33:06.985
<i>They've got my sister now</i>
<i>asking her questions.</i>

33:07.068 --> 33:08.736
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

33:08.820 --> 33:11.823
<i>Huh.</i>
<i>Why are they asking your sister questions?</i>

33:11.906 --> 33:13.366
- <i>I don't know.</i>
-<i>Hmm.</i>

33:14.617 --> 33:17.495
<i>Lee, I think they're coming after me,</i>
<i>I know they are.</i>

33:17.578 --> 33:19.539
<i>No, they're not, you're innocent.</i>

33:19.622 --> 33:21.708
<i>-I'm not gonna let you go to jail…</i>
-

33:21.791 --> 33:22.625
<i>…you hear me?</i>

33:23.543 --> 33:25.795
<i>You evidently</i>
<i>don't love me anymore,</i>

33:25.878 --> 33:27.171
<i>you don't trust me or anything.</i>

33:27.255 --> 33:30.008
<i>You're gonna let me get in trouble</i>
<i>for something I didn't do.</i>

33:30.091 --> 33:32.218
-<i> I said I'm not!</i>
-

33:35.805 --> 33:38.307
- <i>Why in the hell did you do this?</i>
<i>-Huh?</i>

33:38.391 --> 33:40.560
- <i>Why did you do this?</i>
- <i>I don't know.</i>

33:43.771 --> 33:45.440
<i>-Listen, Ty.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

33:46.691 --> 33:49.902
<i>I'm probably never</i>
<i>gonna see you again, you know that?</i>

33:49.986 --> 33:50.820
<i>Yes.</i>

33:51.487 --> 33:52.530
<i>I love you.</i>

33:59.954 --> 34:01.956
<i>If I have to confess everything</i>

34:02.040 --> 34:04.542
<i>just to keep you</i>
<i>from getting in trouble, I will.</i>

34:04.625 --> 34:06.836
- <i>Okay.</i>
<i>-So, don't worry, okay?</i>

34:06.919 --> 34:08.129
<i>Okay. </i>

34:08.212 --> 34:10.256
- <i>I love you.</i>
-

34:10.339 --> 34:12.633
<i>Well, do it now, get it over with.</i>

34:13.217 --> 34:16.554
<i>-</i><i> Right this very moment?</i>
<i>-Yes, get it over with.</i>

34:17.138 --> 34:18.598
- <i>All right.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

34:18.681 --> 34:21.642
- <i>All right. I love you.</i>
-<i>Okay, bye.</i>

34:46.626 --> 34:48.294
 Okay, so then what you're telling us

34:48.377 --> 34:51.506
is you're voluntarily
coming forward to talk to us now.

34:51.589 --> 34:54.467
Yeah, to let you know
that I'm the one that did the killing.

35:00.681 --> 35:04.560
I know that I don't want
my girlfriend involved.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.771
She did not do anything,

35:06.854 --> 35:09.816
and I'm trying to make this clear,
that's why I'm confessing.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.907
But what I did,

35:17.990 --> 35:20.243
I don't understand why I did it,
I just don't.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.286
 I-- I just don't.

35:25.581 --> 35:27.166
I should have never done it.

35:30.670 --> 35:35.258
See, most of times, I was drunk as hell,
and I was a professional hooker.

35:43.599 --> 35:46.477
They were bad,
'cause they were gonna hurt me.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.980
This person was either gonna
physically beat me up,

35:49.063 --> 35:50.398
rape me or kill me.

35:51.023 --> 35:52.358
And I don't know which one.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.277
And I just turned around and

35:55.361 --> 35:58.281
did my fair play before I would get hurt.

36:33.524 --> 36:36.068
-She loved you, didn't she?
- Yes.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.989
She said she'd do anything for you,
didn't she?

36:40.072 --> 36:40.907
Yes, she did.

36:40.990 --> 36:44.368
And in order for her to say
what you wanted her to,

36:44.452 --> 36:45.411
you lied to her.

36:45.912 --> 36:46.871
-Right?
-Yes.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.297
<i>In Deland, Florida, tomorrow,</i>

36:56.380 --> 36:59.425
<i>a judge will sentence</i>
<i>the first female serial killer</i>

36:59.508 --> 37:01.385
<i>ever brought to trial in this country.</i>

37:01.469 --> 37:03.262
<i>Today, the jury in the case recommended</i>

37:03.346 --> 37:06.307
<i>that Aileen Wuornos</i>
<i>get the electric chair.</i>

37:06.390 --> 37:07.600
<i>Wuornos is a prostitute.</i>

37:07.683 --> 37:10.686
<i>She was convicted of killing a man</i>
<i>who picked her up for sex.</i>

37:33.793 --> 37:36.295
There's no sense
in keeping-- keeping me alive,

37:36.379 --> 37:39.340
because I just would
absolutely kill again.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.175
I've got too much anger,

37:41.259 --> 37:42.468
too much hatred in me.
