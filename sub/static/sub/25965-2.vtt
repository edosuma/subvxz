Okay.

we can provide that as well.

when that happens.
Mm-hmm, yes. Yes, yes.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.348
So sometimes
what we can do is,

19:10.383 --> 19:15.319
we can clip off just the top,
leave the root in there

19:15.355 --> 19:17.488
and then make a temporary
that you can wear,

19:17.524 --> 19:19.357

right away.

you do have fight,

of the gums healing

as opposed to taking a tooth out

for that to heal.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.870
I think at this point,

we want to just remove
the tooth,

19:34.307 --> 19:36.307
the part of the tooth
that's loose,

19:36.342 --> 19:38.609
and leave the rest of it
in place.

and fighting again.

All right, ladies.
Second round. Fight is on.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.658
Nice! Jab!

39:21.693 --> 39:24.327
¶

39:24.363 --> 39:27.030
So round two, Pannie starts
the action right away.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.832
She comes in
with a straight left

39:28.867 --> 39:33.269
and quickly gets
another takedown.

39:33.305 --> 39:34.738
Nice!

39:34.773 --> 39:36.005
Hey, relax, relax.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.807
You got the position.
Relax.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.976
You know, she lands
on top of Kathy.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.911
Kathy is trying to sweep her
the entire time,

39:41.947 --> 39:44.714
trying to get some sort
of positional advantage.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.016
Post her, stand up.
Fence!

39:47.052 --> 39:50.353
Knee to the cage.
There you go.

39:50.389 --> 39:52.389
Whittaker: Katharina
does make her way back up,

39:52.424 --> 39:56.025
but, you know, by the end of it,
it's just a bit too late.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.862
-Nice, let's go, Katharina!
-Get on top!

39:58.897 --> 40:01.965
[ Indistinct shouting ]

40:02.000 --> 40:03.433
Whittaker: She ends up
getting taken down again,

40:03.468 --> 40:04.801
and it's just, you know...

40:04.836 --> 40:07.937
It's too late to do anything
at that stage.

40:07.973 --> 40:10.173
Make points, right there.
Make points.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.442
There you go.
After the two rounds,

40:12.477 --> 40:13.643
I definitely feel
like Pannie won.

40:13.678 --> 40:16.846
She dominated the fight.
She dominated both rounds,

40:16.882 --> 40:19.149
and she went hard
for two 5-minute rounds,

40:19.217 --> 40:21.418
and we're feeling pretty good.

40:21.453 --> 40:22.986
Winner and moving on,

40:23.021 --> 40:28.291
Pannie!
[ Cheers and applause ]

40:28.326 --> 40:31.728
¶

40:31.763 --> 40:34.364
Kianzad: So this fight was
definitely worth waiting for,

40:34.399 --> 40:35.865
and I'm happy now that

40:35.901 --> 40:37.500
it didn't happen in Invicta

40:37.536 --> 40:39.235
or in Europe.

40:39.271 --> 40:40.770
I just...

40:40.806 --> 40:43.573
This was so much better,
to get this win here.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.009
-I knew.
-So awesome.

40:46.044 --> 40:49.746
[ Indistinct cheering ]

40:49.781 --> 40:52.182
I'm so happy that it happened
because this was, like,

40:52.217 --> 40:53.783
everything I've ever wanted,

40:53.819 --> 40:56.186
and that's why
I was so emotional.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.288
I felt that everything
I had worked hard

40:58.323 --> 40:59.856
for finally paid off.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.624
I'm just going to keep on going.

41:01.660 --> 41:04.194
This is not the end.
This is just one fight.

41:05.130 --> 41:11.100
-How do you feel?
-Not good. I was...

41:11.136 --> 41:15.104
My muscles were tight
after the first round.

41:15.140 --> 41:20.176
You know, it's heart-wrenching
because I care for my athletes.

41:20.212 --> 41:21.845
I just want the best
for these guys,

41:21.880 --> 41:23.713
and to now be on the back
of two losses,

41:23.748 --> 41:24.781
you know, we're just...

41:24.816 --> 41:26.616
We're here for this game,
this sport.

41:26.651 --> 41:27.884
This is what happens.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.118
We're going to get back
on the horse tomorrow

41:29.154 --> 41:30.753
and keep working, you know?

41:30.789 --> 41:32.755
We can't be beaten this way.
We can't be broken.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.557
¶

41:34.593 --> 41:37.193
I think I could have done more

41:37.229 --> 41:38.361
in the stand-up,

41:38.396 --> 41:40.263
more strikes, more kicks,

41:40.298 --> 41:42.966
but now it's easy to say.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.568
Yep.

41:45.604 --> 41:47.370
I think you learn every time

41:47.405 --> 41:50.640
if you win or lose, but hey.

41:50.675 --> 41:53.610
"You have to work on this.
You have to work on this."

41:53.645 --> 41:55.812
There are people out
who are better than you,

41:55.847 --> 41:57.747
and, yeah, it's not bad to lose.

41:57.782 --> 41:58.815
It's part of the game.

41:58.850 --> 42:08.424
¶

42:08.460 --> 42:09.926
My heavyweight pick

42:09.961 --> 42:11.327
is Anderson

42:11.363 --> 42:12.695
versus Justin.

42:12.731 --> 42:16.699
¶

42:16.735 --> 42:19.669
Whittaker: I picked
Anderson against Justin

42:19.704 --> 42:22.272
because I think
it's a logical pick,

42:22.307 --> 42:23.606
tall guy against a shorter guy,

42:23.642 --> 42:25.909
especially when my guy,
Anderson,

42:25.944 --> 42:29.312
who's the taller fighter,
has a striking background.

42:29.347 --> 42:32.415
If Anderson can keep Justin
off him with his strikes,

42:32.450 --> 42:33.883
not let Justin push him up
against the fence

42:33.919 --> 42:36.352
and take him down, then Justin
is in for a world of pain.

42:36.388 --> 42:38.922
¶

42:38.957 --> 42:41.391
We're definitely worried about
this matchup with Anderson

42:41.426 --> 42:42.792
against our guy, Justin,

42:42.827 --> 42:44.294
just because Justin didn't have

42:44.329 --> 42:46.129
a good showing
in the evaluations,

42:46.164 --> 42:49.866
and Anderson, as we all know,
he's a great striker, you know?

42:49.901 --> 42:51.467
But this is not
a striking fight.

42:51.503 --> 42:53.002
This is an MMA fight,
and that's what

42:53.038 --> 42:55.705
we specialize in,
and we're going to try

42:55.740 --> 42:58.041
and make Justin the best
he can be that night.

42:58.076 --> 43:02.445
