00:56.657 --> 00:58.724
- Your favorite.
- Wow!

01:02.262 --> 01:04.563
Only the best for
the best bestie

01:04.565 --> 01:06.231
a best bestie could have.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.067
Oh, my goodness!

01:08.069 --> 01:10.002
Thank you so much,
B-Fly.

01:10.004 --> 01:12.004
I mean, a princess
such as myself

01:12.006 --> 01:14.740
could never indulge in
such confections.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.575
But would you please
donate them

01:16.577 --> 01:19.178
to the starving Bartindles
of Galafamor on my behalf?

01:20.713 --> 01:22.915
Did you bump
your uni-horn again?

01:22.917 --> 01:25.117
Girl, you know we can't
receive packages here at

01:25.119 --> 01:26.885
St. Olga's School
For Wayward Princesses.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.822
( shrieks )
Get out, get
out, get out!

01:31.624 --> 01:32.991
B-Fly?

01:32.993 --> 01:36.895
I can't even stand
to hear the name
of that place.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.898
( shuddering )

01:39.900 --> 01:42.734
Oh, please, you gots
to be chill, B-Fly.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.636
I'm the one doing
hard time here.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.772
I know, but if you
weren't there,

01:46.774 --> 01:48.941
we could totally
party it up.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.742
Rainbow tea at
the Dowager Room,

01:50.744 --> 01:53.745
sliding down the twisty
slopes of Zalla Mountain,

01:53.747 --> 01:58.183
then dancing all night long
at the Bounce Lounge.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.952
Oh, heck yeah, girl.

01:59.954 --> 02:03.388
That would be the best
birthday day ever! Boom!

02:03.390 --> 02:05.390
- ( metallic creaking )
- Oh, no.

02:05.392 --> 02:08.760
I expressed my individuality
and publicly showed an emotion.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.796
And that's my third strike.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.698
Oh, no, no, please.
No, no!

02:12.700 --> 02:15.167
They're sending me to
the solitary conforment chamber.

02:15.169 --> 02:17.169
Pony Head!

02:17.171 --> 02:20.339
Oh, you don't
deserve this!

02:20.341 --> 02:22.174
Ready to take out
life's frustrations

02:22.176 --> 02:24.910
on some ill-intentioned
monsters?

02:24.912 --> 02:28.347
( loud sobbing )
This is terrible!

02:28.349 --> 02:30.716
Best friends don't let
best besties

02:30.718 --> 02:32.251
have bad
birthday days.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.786
( blows loudly )

02:34.788 --> 02:37.055
And Pony Head is having
the worst one ever.

02:37.057 --> 02:39.791
Pony Head?
Yeah, I'm outta here.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.793
Marco, we have to get her
out of that prison.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.663
Oh, a breakout.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.965
Why didn't you say so?

02:46.967 --> 02:48.901
- Wait, isn't St. O's--
- ( shrieks )

02:48.903 --> 02:50.769
St. O., St. O., St. O.!

02:50.771 --> 02:53.071
Uh, we haven't even
left yet.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.174
Sorry.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.342
What's that
under your rug?

02:57.344 --> 03:00.012
I have no idea.
But I do know one thing.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.748
Never, ever step on it.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.349
Let's get back to
that breakout thing.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.718
But no one's ever
escaped from there.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.387
I've seen every
prison escape movie made.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.055
We only need three things.

03:10.057 --> 03:14.359
Patience, brains,
and the ever-famous,

03:14.361 --> 03:16.862
multi-faceted
bobby pin.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.698
Or we use my dimensional
scissors to go

03:19.700 --> 03:22.267
straight to her cell and get her
the heck outta there.

03:24.237 --> 03:27.472
Uh, this isn't
Pony Head's cell.

03:27.474 --> 03:31.076
Huh. I'm usually
pretty accurate
with these things.

03:31.078 --> 03:34.112
- ( horses whinnying )
- ( exclaiming )

03:40.153 --> 03:43.855
Ah, yes, the newbies
have arrived.

03:43.857 --> 03:47.759
Welcome to St. Olga's
School For Wayward Princesses.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.795
( thunder crashing )

03:49.797 --> 03:52.397
- ( screaming )
- New arrivals?

03:52.399 --> 03:54.967
If we could just
blend in somehow,

03:54.969 --> 03:56.902
we could sneak in
unnoticed.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.370
All we need is a--

03:58.372 --> 04:01.106
Radiant shadow
transport!

04:07.080 --> 04:09.481
Whoa! Do me.
Do me.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.216
Radiant shadow
transport!

04:12.752 --> 04:15.153
You couldn't turn me
into one of those guards

04:15.155 --> 04:16.822
with the cool masks?

04:16.824 --> 04:17.956
I don't know.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.858
Pink is definitely
your color.

04:21.794 --> 04:23.762
Single file.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.898
Miss Heinous
is eager to start

04:26.900 --> 04:29.835
the reformation process.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.774
( squealing )
Marco.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.176
Try not to blow
our cover.

04:41.814 --> 04:44.950
MAN: <i>Don't allow your noble</i>
<i>lineage to be thrown away.</i>

04:44.952 --> 04:47.853
<i>Here at the tried</i>
<i>and trusted St. Olga's...</i>

04:49.789 --> 04:52.357
<i>...we have a plethora</i>
<i>of foolproof security measures.</i>

04:52.359 --> 04:56.295
<i>No dimensional scissors,</i>
<i>no magic, no boys...</i>

04:58.097 --> 05:00.265
<i>...and etiquette</i>
<i>are the main focus for...</i>

05:02.101 --> 05:04.803
<i>...your troubled,</i>
<i>wayward princess.</i>

05:04.805 --> 05:07.906
<i>( woman whispering )</i>
<i>Wayward princess.</i>

05:07.908 --> 05:09.975
<i>We turn undisciplined</i>
<i>behavior</i>

05:09.977 --> 05:12.010
<i>into perfection.</i>

05:14.347 --> 05:17.149
<i>That free-thinking,</i>
<i>one-in-a-million brat</i>

05:17.151 --> 05:18.483
<i>will become</i>
<i>a one-of-a-million</i>

05:18.485 --> 05:19.985
<i>emotionless rubber stamp</i>

05:19.987 --> 05:22.521
<i>that your bloodline</i>
<i>can count on.</i>

05:32.932 --> 05:36.435
Every one of you
is here for a reason.

05:38.438 --> 05:41.373
Too wild.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.075
Too opinionated.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.480
Too bubbly.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.315
As part of a noble
lineage,

05:50.317 --> 05:53.352
you don't have the luxury
of being an individual.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.921
So by the time
I'm done with you,

05:55.923 --> 05:57.889
you'll all be fixed.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.191
Every last one of you,

05:59.193 --> 06:01.526
whether you're
from Pixtopia,

06:01.528 --> 06:03.428
or Mewni.

06:03.430 --> 06:06.998
And don't even think
about escaping.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.934
These are useless.

06:08.936 --> 06:12.003
We have a Tramorfidian Crystal
in Tower 3.

06:12.005 --> 06:15.874
No rift can sustain itself
within our walls.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.244
So you might as well cough up
the scissors you smuggled in.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.546
( all groaning )

06:21.548 --> 06:23.382
It's totally hopeless.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.450
Once we get Pony Head
and disable that crystal thing,

06:25.452 --> 06:27.352
those are our ticket
outta here.

06:27.354 --> 06:30.889
That concludes
your orientation.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.159
I'm confident that
you'll all become

06:34.161 --> 06:36.194
perfect princesses.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.030
One way or another.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.333
Now to get everyone
checked in

06:41.335 --> 06:45.036
so we can start sucking
the individuality out of you.

06:45.038 --> 06:48.573
( high-pitched voice )
I hear the first one
checked in

06:48.575 --> 06:50.909
gets her own room.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.978
( all exclaiming )

06:52.980 --> 06:54.379
Respect the queue.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.515
Respect the queue!

07:01.154 --> 07:03.955
- This place isn't
what I thought--
- Sh!

07:07.427 --> 07:08.994
Yeah, breaking out
Pony Head

07:08.996 --> 07:10.996
is gonna be a breeze.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.932
It's just a high-surveillance
prissy finishing school.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.102
No, Marco, it's worse
than I imagined. Look.

07:34.987 --> 07:37.255
You know the kind
of girls who get sent here.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.958
They can totally
benefit from this.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.993
( bird continues
whistling )

07:41.995 --> 07:44.463
No, no, no.

07:46.966 --> 07:50.135
You're not leaving
until you get this right.

07:53.573 --> 07:58.043
You know, this place has
some seriously luxurious digs.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.444
Have you gone mad?

07:59.446 --> 08:01.213
Come on.

08:01.215 --> 08:04.549
Look at the intricate
floral ornamentation
on that armoire.

08:04.551 --> 08:07.085
( gasps )
The rich mahogany
of the canopy bed.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.722
And there's enough velvet
on that bedspread
for me to swim in.

08:10.724 --> 08:14.526
- Don't you see what's
going on here?
- Dancing?

08:14.528 --> 08:18.096
Let's just find Pony Head
and get outta here.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.567
There she is.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.503
Let's blow down the door
so we can get outta here.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.371
No. We gotta do this
quietly,

08:26.373 --> 08:28.106
without drawing
any attention.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.743
( loudly ) ♪ I am here

08:31.745 --> 08:33.578

08:33.580 --> 08:35.580
Do you wanna
get us caught?

08:35.582 --> 08:38.316
Sorry. Pony Head.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.486
Hey, it's us,
here to break you out,

08:41.488 --> 08:43.255
so we can party.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.094
- Ah!
- My deepest apologies,

08:49.096 --> 08:50.328
but I must abstain,

08:50.330 --> 08:53.398
as partying is for
the unrefined.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.067
That's not the Pony Head
I know and love.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.736
I got this.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.238
Hey, Pointy Head.
It's Earth Turd.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.709
Such language belongs in
the gutters of Galafamor.

09:04.711 --> 09:08.313
You know, I kinda
like her better this way.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.181
Snap out of it,
Pony Head.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.716
Snap out of it!

09:11.718 --> 09:14.452
( laughs )
Would you care
for some crumpets?

09:14.454 --> 09:17.188
See, Marco, this is what
they do to you here.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.692
Relax. Once we disable
that crystal thing
and get her outta here,

09:20.694 --> 09:23.194
she'll finally be
a benefit to society.

09:25.531 --> 09:26.698
What are you doing?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.700
I saw this
in a prison movie.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.435
<i>Escape From</i>
<i>Jail Mountain.</i>

09:30.437 --> 09:32.270
Trust me, this'll
save our hides,

09:32.272 --> 09:35.273
just like it saved
Hank Innocent.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.478
It's clear.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.747
Oh, escaping
is inappropriate.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.282
Guards.
Guards!

09:44.284 --> 09:46.818
Guards!
Yoo-hoo, guards.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.120
Hey, stop!

09:49.122 --> 09:52.424
Keep your pinkies
at 90 degrees.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.726
More tea, please.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.262
Keep your pinkies
at 90 degrees.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.565
More tea, please.
Keep your pinkies at...

10:00.567 --> 10:03.602
This is worse than
my worst nightmare.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.438
Yeah. I see
what you mean.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.574
Keep your pinkies
at 90 degrees.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.109
Why are you
saying that?

10:11.111 --> 10:13.178
You don't even
have pinkies.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.281
- Come on.
- ( chanting continues )

10:16.283 --> 10:19.217
More tea, please.

10:19.219 --> 10:22.120
He's right on us.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.522
Are we gonna
blast our way
out of this?

10:24.524 --> 10:26.858
No. That'll only
increase the heat on us.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.694
We need some kind
of distraction.

10:29.696 --> 10:32.230
Well, they are not
getting my individuality.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.531
That's it.

10:33.533 --> 10:37.769
It's not criminal
to be an individual.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.606
Come on.
It's not criminal

10:41.608 --> 10:43.475
to be an individual.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.544
It's not criminal
to be an individual.

10:46.546 --> 10:50.482
ALL: It's not criminal
to be an individual.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.251
That should
buy us some time.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.252
( chanting continues )

10:54.254 --> 10:57.222
Tee-hee. He got scolded.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.157
She's laughing at
an authority figure.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.259
I think the real
Pony Head's still in there.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.629
An uprising?

11:04.631 --> 11:07.699
In my institution?

11:07.701 --> 11:10.201
Put St. O.'s on
full lockdown

11:10.203 --> 11:13.338
and find the free thinker
who initiated this.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.508
We will quell this uprising
in its infancy.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.611
Quell, quell.

11:19.613 --> 11:21.312
Is that right?

11:21.314 --> 11:22.947
Someone get
a thesaurus.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.454
Wrong way.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.593
Quick. Find
a place to hide.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.731
There she is.
Get her.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.268
Oh!

11:45.705 --> 11:48.606
We've stifled
the uprising.

11:48.608 --> 11:51.376
Soon we'll find
those responsible

11:51.378 --> 11:55.246
and stifle them in
a solitary conforment chamber.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.848
Here's our latest
success story.

11:56.850 --> 12:00.351
The once-wayward
Princess Pony Head

12:00.353 --> 12:02.921
is now a model student,
reborn.

12:02.923 --> 12:06.691
Yes. I'm glad
we stifled the uprising.

12:06.693 --> 12:10.295
You know, stifled
isn't working for me either.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.497
Prepare the chamber.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.632
I'm leading this
princess hunt myself.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.274
MARCO: What is this place?

12:23.276 --> 12:24.843
STAR: I don't know.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.445
( dogs barking )

12:27.447 --> 12:29.314
We gotta move.

12:33.686 --> 12:37.388
There. I'll see you
at the bottom.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.024
My poufy dress
won't fit.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.994
Marco!!

12:42.996 --> 12:44.329
Something's got
my stockings.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.964
( screaming )

12:47.833 --> 12:50.468
( screaming )

12:52.404 --> 12:53.772
( laughing )

12:57.409 --> 12:59.944
Marco. You gotta
help me save him.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.546
I can't do this alone.

13:04.850 --> 13:08.019
A princess who misbehaves
will be saved

13:08.021 --> 13:11.322
in the solitary
conforment chamber.

13:11.324 --> 13:14.292
Why can't you remember
who you are?

13:14.294 --> 13:16.394
( door slams )

13:24.336 --> 13:25.870
Really? What?

13:33.913 --> 13:36.948
<i>The proper hat</i>
<i>for the event</i>

13:36.950 --> 13:40.351
<i>lest you be</i>
<i>a malcontent.</i>

13:40.353 --> 13:42.420
<i>Everyone will admire</i>

13:42.422 --> 13:45.957
<i>the princess who</i>
<i>does not perspire.</i>

13:45.959 --> 13:48.593
<i>'Tis better to be fussy</i>

13:48.595 --> 13:51.062
<i>than to be called</i>
<i>a hussy.</i>

13:51.064 --> 13:54.098
Ugh. I can smell
her free spirit

13:54.100 --> 13:57.502
through the safety glass.
Full power.

13:59.939 --> 14:02.507
So this is how it ends.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.509
On a cold checkered floor

14:04.511 --> 14:06.477
by a pile of soiled linens,

14:06.479 --> 14:08.580
wearing an eye patch.

14:08.582 --> 14:12.483
"Embrace a princess
mentality.

14:12.485 --> 14:16.855
Wash away
your individuality"?

14:16.857 --> 14:20.725
Embrace this!

14:27.399 --> 14:30.802
( sobbing )

14:36.876 --> 14:41.145
( laughing )

14:43.048 --> 14:45.783
Yeah. That feels
so good! Whoo!

14:50.856 --> 14:53.558
Pony Head?
You're back!

14:53.560 --> 14:56.394
Oh, you know it.
Now let's go destroy
something else.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.496
I don't even care
what it is.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.031
( Marco screaming )

15:00.033 --> 15:02.634
Ooh, hold it.
I'd recognize that
girly scream anywhere.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.036
That's Earth Turd.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.071
Yep. Heinous got him.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.407
Well, what are we
waiting for?

15:09.409 --> 15:12.043
Isn't he your best bestie?
- Yeah.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.780
On Earth. I'm still
your best bestie overall, right?

15:15.782 --> 15:18.416
- Come on.
- ( Marco screaming )

15:18.418 --> 15:20.518
Open that vent.

15:22.087 --> 15:25.690
Keep screamin', Marco.

15:25.692 --> 15:29.761
Proper throne posture.
( screams )

15:29.763 --> 15:33.932
Yes. We are extinguishing
that rebellious spirit.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.870
Make it stop!

15:38.872 --> 15:41.205
( screaming )

15:41.207 --> 15:43.775
I'm blasting our way
outta here, Marco.
You cool with that?

15:43.777 --> 15:45.810
Where did she get
that wand?

15:45.812 --> 15:47.812
( screams )

15:47.814 --> 15:49.580
Gotcha, Marco.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.116
Now let's get
the heck outta here.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.152
Are they gonna let me
keep the dress?

15:54.154 --> 15:56.454
Shoo. Shoo, shoo,
shoo, shoo.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.756
- Go away!
- Your cheeks.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.558
No. Stop it, stop it.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.627
You saw nothing.

16:02.629 --> 16:06.698
A princess always
maintains her poise.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.535
I'm glad you're
back to normal, by the way.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.570
Aw, you too.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.972
Now I can make fun
of your ugly dress.

16:13.974 --> 16:17.675
It's not criminal
to be an individual.

16:17.677 --> 16:21.179
ALL: It's not criminal
to be an individual.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.948
Man, I can't believe it,
but you sure worked

16:23.950 --> 16:25.550
some turd magic
on these girls.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.118
They are in it.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.486
Yeah, you really
started something.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.254
My work here
is not done.

16:30.256 --> 16:34.625
My fellow wayward sisters,
I'll show you the way.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.195
They want you to be
a rubber-stamp princess.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.931
I saw we stamp on them!

16:39.933 --> 16:42.500
( yelling )

16:48.974 --> 16:50.608
There's the tower.

17:03.822 --> 17:06.991
Raspberry Panzerfaust!

17:10.095 --> 17:12.597
Looks like that
did the job.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.605
Let's get outta here.
Whoa.

17:20.607 --> 17:23.174
Whoa!

17:26.712 --> 17:28.546
Time's a-wastin'.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.615
If we hurry, we can
still catch DJ Jump-Jump's set

17:30.617 --> 17:33.217
- at the Bounce Lounge.
- Girl, I ain't goin' nowhere.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.020
The Bounce Lounge ain't got
nothin' on this party.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.889
But it's your birthday day.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.024
You gave me
the best gift ever,

17:40.026 --> 17:41.092
and it's called,

17:41.094 --> 17:43.261
getting me
my groove back.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.762
Look at me.
It's back, babe.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.564
BOTH: Hugs.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.071
So you wanna stay here?

17:53.073 --> 17:54.739
Oh, I gotta.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.340
I can't let what
happened to me

17:56.342 --> 17:58.743
happen to anyone else.
Right, Princess Turdina?

17:58.745 --> 18:01.779
Get on with your bad self,
my wayward sister.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.215
Yeah! I'm gonna go bite
some of those robot guards

18:04.217 --> 18:06.851
- on their faces.
- Bite one for me.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.719
Okay, Marco, I conquered
my biggest fear,

18:08.721 --> 18:10.254
I grew as a person,
yada yada yada.

18:10.256 --> 18:13.224
Let's get outta here
and never come back.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.593
If your elbows
are on the table,

18:15.595 --> 18:18.763
you belong
in a stable.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.665
There.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.067
All better.

18:51.763 --> 18:53.798
Hmm.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.667
I will find
the rabble rousers

18:56.669 --> 19:00.238
responsible for this
and annihilate them!

19:00.240 --> 19:02.773
Annihilate.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.776
That's the verb
I've been looking for.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.683
