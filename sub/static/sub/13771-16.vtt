this thing really cracks.

00:07.703 --> 00:08.878
Hey, would you hold this for me?

00:08.965 --> 00:11.098
What's that
on the floor?

00:11.185 --> 00:13.926
The poem I wrote about kittens.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.841
That's so weird.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.713
I guess I have no choice

00:17.800 --> 00:20.846
but to bend over
wearing last year's shorts

00:20.933 --> 00:22.892
and pick it up.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.724
He's really sick, Mom.

They're here.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.634
Francis and Piama
are spending the weekend

01:09.721 --> 01:10.809
for Francis' birthday.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.159
He's turning 21 tomorrow.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.986
I haven't seen Dad this excited

01:14.074 --> 01:16.467
since he thought Francis
turned 21 last year.

01:16.554 --> 01:17.860
Hey, it's the birthday boy!

01:17.947 --> 01:20.297
Or should I say birthday man?
[laughs]

01:20.384 --> 01:22.952
I know you said not to bring
anything, but I brought a salad.

01:23.039 --> 01:23.953
Oh, thank you, Piama.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.346
That's so thoughtful.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.609
I'll just take it in the kitchen
and rewash it.

01:27.696 --> 01:28.784
[laughs]

01:28.871 --> 01:30.481
Oh...

01:30.568 --> 01:32.527
-[chuckles]
-[whispering]: I am so excited.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.529
Yeah, it's going to
be a great party.

01:34.616 --> 01:35.660
No, not the party.

01:35.747 --> 01:36.966
The... you know what.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.316
Oh.

01:39.403 --> 01:40.709
Yeah.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.363
Thank you so much.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.669
I've been looking forward
to this for 12 years.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.280
12 long years.

01:46.367 --> 01:47.194
[gasping]

01:47.281 --> 01:49.805
Yes, well,

01:49.892 --> 01:53.025
it's going to be everything
you dreamed it would.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.419
This totally makes
the Peter Pan thing worthwhile.

01:56.638 --> 01:58.205
HAL [echoing]:
Peter Pan?

01:58.292 --> 01:59.684
Peter Pan?

01:59.771 --> 02:00.903
Peter Pan.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.384
[Francis sobbing]

02:03.471 --> 02:04.907
Oh, Francis, please.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.996
Oh, God,
I am so sorry.

02:07.083 --> 02:09.303
I didn't know
your school play was today.

02:09.389 --> 02:12.088
You saw me leave
in this costume!

02:12.175 --> 02:13.394
Francis, please, stop crying.

02:13.481 --> 02:14.917
I am so sorry.

02:15.004 --> 02:16.397
Look, I'll do anything
to make it up to you.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.268
What do you want?
I'll do anything.

02:18.355 --> 02:19.922
I want to go
on a motorcycle trip

02:20.009 --> 02:21.445
like you always talk about.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.186
Honey, that was way
back in college.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.101
And you know how
your mother feels...

02:25.188 --> 02:27.669
I want a motorcycle trip
with my dad!

02:27.756 --> 02:28.757
-Okay. Okay.
-[crying]

02:28.844 --> 02:29.627
I'll tell you what.

02:29.714 --> 02:30.715
When you turn 21,

02:30.802 --> 02:32.369
I promise I will take you

02:32.456 --> 02:36.286
on the most awesome,
special motorcycle trip, okay?

02:36.373 --> 02:38.897
-We'll go when you turn 21.
-[whimpering]

02:38.984 --> 02:40.725
Oh, yeah.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.466
Motorcycle trip.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.164
[grunts] At first I thought
you were just saying it

02:44.251 --> 02:45.556
to shut me up.

02:45.643 --> 02:48.516
You're just saying this
to shut me up.

02:48.603 --> 02:50.518
-[whimpering]
-No! Son, this is a promise.

02:50.605 --> 02:52.302
On the day
of your 21st birthday,

02:52.389 --> 02:54.174
I swear by all
that is holy,

02:54.261 --> 02:56.132
you and I will go on
a father-son motorcycle trip,

02:56.219 --> 02:57.612
so help me God!

02:57.699 --> 02:59.309
How are you going
to get Mom to let you?

02:59.396 --> 03:03.618
I swear on my life, Francis,
nothing will stop this.

03:03.705 --> 03:06.055
This is the holiest,
most sacred promise

03:06.142 --> 03:07.926
between a father and a son.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.625
And nothing,
and I mean nothing,

03:10.712 --> 03:13.410
can ever undo this promise!

03:13.497 --> 03:16.326
Boy, sure liked to nail
things down, didn't I?

03:16.413 --> 03:17.414
-[chuckles]
-Oh, yeah.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.503
It's going to be great.

03:19.590 --> 03:20.722
Wait, wasn't there...?

03:20.809 --> 03:22.289
[grunts]

03:22.376 --> 03:24.813
This is sealed in blood.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.684
Do you hear me, son?

03:26.771 --> 03:28.730
Sealed in blood.

03:29.687 --> 03:30.732
Oh, crap.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.474
Okay, I'll pitch in
three dollars

03:33.561 --> 03:35.302
-for Francis' birthday present.
-Me, too.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.304
And three from me.
So we're agreed.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.480
We're giving Francis nine
dollars for his birthday.

03:39.567 --> 03:42.091
Hey, your friend's outside.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.659
What do you mean
"friend"?

03:44.746 --> 03:46.748
Your friend, Randy somebody.

03:46.835 --> 03:49.141
-Really big kid.
-Randy Zane?

03:49.229 --> 03:50.926
Yeah, I think
he wants to play baseball.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.101
-What?
-He's outside right now

03:52.188 --> 03:53.363
with his bat.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.625
Seems really impatient.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.236
You know,
I told you boys

03:56.323 --> 03:58.281
if you just made an effort
you can make friends.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.327
You see? You listened to me
and it paid off.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.502
Just think
how much easier

04:01.589 --> 04:02.894
your lives would be

04:02.981 --> 04:05.157
if you listened to me
all the time.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.770
God, he looks mad.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.815
Which one of us
do you think he wants?

04:10.902 --> 04:12.556
Reese, it's obviously you.

04:12.643 --> 04:13.992
That must've been his bike

04:14.079 --> 04:15.211
that you superglued
to the train tracks.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.430
We don't know that.

04:16.517 --> 04:17.735
You were pretty
fast and loose

04:17.822 --> 04:19.084
with that dog-crap
slingshot the other day.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.521
How do you know
you didn't hit him?

04:20.608 --> 04:21.608
What about you?

04:21.696 --> 04:22.784
How many people
did you convince

04:22.871 --> 04:24.525
to buy those
"algebra pills"?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.135
You know, our lives
would be a lot easier

04:26.222 --> 04:28.137
if we didn't all pull this crap
at the same time.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.573
I suggested a rotating
calendar years ago,

04:29.660 --> 04:30.835
and you guys ignored me.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.533
And here we are.

04:32.620 --> 04:33.969
Let's just go tell Mom.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.710
We can't.
If we send Mom out there,

04:35.797 --> 04:36.885
Randy will just
tell her what we did,

04:36.972 --> 04:38.713
and then
they'll both be after us.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.367
Did you see that movie where
Freddie teamed up with Jason?

04:40.454 --> 04:41.803
Is that what you want?

04:41.890 --> 04:42.891
Then what do we do?

04:42.978 --> 04:44.632
He can't
stand out there forever.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.198
We'll just wait him out.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.505
So what if we have
to stay inside for a while.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.814
Oh, my God,
he's still out there.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.946
I think he grew.

04:55.033 --> 04:58.254
Why is he smoking
two cigarettes?

04:58.341 --> 05:00.604
Those are his eyes.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.261
Hal, what are you doing?

05:05.348 --> 05:06.610
I'm just trying
to think of some wise things

05:06.697 --> 05:08.351
to say to Francis tomorrow.

05:08.438 --> 05:11.528
A father should have some wisdom
for his son, don't you think?

05:11.615 --> 05:12.921
Well, it is a big day.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.879
You only turn 21 once.

05:17.752 --> 05:19.188
Hey...

05:19.275 --> 05:21.712
remember before he was born,

05:21.799 --> 05:24.149
and I had that Harley Da--

05:24.236 --> 05:26.413
No motorcycles ever!

05:26.500 --> 05:28.545
You do not talk
about motorcycles.

05:28.632 --> 05:29.807
You do not think,
you do not wish,

05:29.894 --> 05:31.766
you do not even
reminisce about

05:31.853 --> 05:33.985
those stupid,
idiotic death traps!

05:34.072 --> 05:35.291
They do not exist!

05:35.378 --> 05:37.206
Motorcycles do not exist!

05:37.293 --> 05:38.816
Say it!

05:38.903 --> 05:40.252
Motorcycles do not exist.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.515
What does not exist?

05:41.602 --> 05:43.691
-I don't know.
-Good!

05:44.866 --> 05:47.347
He was out there all night?

05:47.434 --> 05:48.783
Doesn't he get bored?

05:48.870 --> 05:50.567
Do sharks get bored?

05:50.654 --> 05:53.222
You know what, we'll just stay
inside all day today, too.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.093
We can last longer than he can.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.357
Mmm.

05:57.444 --> 05:58.401
So that's
your famous pasta sauce

05:58.488 --> 06:00.185
Francis talks so much about?

06:00.272 --> 06:03.014
Yeah, I only make it for
birthdays and acquittals.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.494
One time it was both.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.409
I just love the smell
of home cooking.

06:06.496 --> 06:07.323
Really?

06:07.410 --> 06:08.672
Do you know there's a way

06:08.759 --> 06:10.326
to get that smell
in your own house?

06:10.413 --> 06:11.849
[quietly]:
Okay, it's all set up.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.851
The rental place
is delivering two motorcycles

06:13.938 --> 06:16.158
to the gas station
on 10th and Coolidge.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.247
I already have
a couple of satchels packed.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.597
At 5:30, we'll just slip out
and disappear.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.773
This is so awesome.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.514
So Francis, your birthday dinner
starts at 6:00.

06:24.601 --> 06:25.994
I hope you're hungry.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.169
Oh, gosh, I sure am.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.997
I'm hungry for all of it.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.390
My only problem
will be deciding

06:30.477 --> 06:32.348
which amazing side dish
to eat first.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.002
But I guess I'll solve
that problem at 6:00

06:34.089 --> 06:36.526
'cause that's when
my birthday party starts.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.398
Be cool.

06:47.276 --> 06:50.888
We're going
to be stuck in here forever.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.194
It'll be fine.

06:52.281 --> 06:53.761
Eventually,
he'll get bored,

06:53.848 --> 06:55.676
or tired, or die
of starvation.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.155
But who knows
how long that could take?

06:57.242 --> 06:58.635
I'm going crazy here.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.289
I mean, look at me--
I'm reading a book.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.595
DEWEY:
This is dumb.

07:01.682 --> 07:02.857
I'm not going
to do this anymore.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.119
I'm just going to go out

07:04.206 --> 07:05.468
and see
if it's me he wants.

07:05.555 --> 07:06.730
What are you, nuts?

07:06.817 --> 07:07.862
I'm not going
to live like this.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.211
I've been beaten before.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.691
I'm just going
to get it over with

07:10.778 --> 07:12.867
and live
the rest of my life.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.654
God, he's walking
right up to him.

07:17.741 --> 07:18.786
[blows land, Dewey grunts]

07:18.873 --> 07:19.961
Randy's hitting him.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.136
He's hitting him.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.442
-It's not us!
-[both laughing]

07:22.529 --> 07:24.661
[blows land, Dewey grunts]

07:24.748 --> 07:26.837
You know,
for a little kid,

07:26.924 --> 07:28.839
he can really
take a punch.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.799
I can't believe I've been
going so easy on him.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.931
Give me the tape,
and I'll get this side.

07:34.018 --> 07:34.976
Oh, I got it.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.281
This tape dispenser is tricky.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.631
It'll take me longer
to explain it.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.378
Dewey, are you okay?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.816
Boy, that was a beating.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.601
I mean, no offense
to you guys, but "wow."

07:51.688 --> 07:52.950
Why did he beat you up?
Did he say?

07:53.037 --> 07:54.474
Actually, he said it wasn't me.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.258
Then why'd he
beat you up?

07:56.345 --> 07:57.607
He said it was just a warm-up.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.174
Then he said
to send out my brother.

07:59.261 --> 08:00.784
Which brother,
me or Malcolm?

08:00.871 --> 08:02.133
He just said "brother."

08:03.265 --> 08:04.658
Boy, what a weight off.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.486
It's just so great
to have this over with.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.183
I'm finally free.

08:08.270 --> 08:11.273
And I'm getting
some major tooth fairy money.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.712
You know, Hal,
I realized this afternoon

08:15.799 --> 08:17.932
we don't have any pictures
from Francis's birthday parties.

08:18.019 --> 08:19.847
I want you to make sure you have
plenty of film in the camera.

08:19.934 --> 08:23.067
Will do. Get ready for
a boatload of memories.

08:23.154 --> 08:24.678
-Uh, Dad?
-[chuckles] Yeah?

08:24.765 --> 08:25.853
Can you come out here
for a sec?

08:25.940 --> 08:26.984
Sure.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.294
No, no, no, no, no.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.991
These were supposed
to go to the gas station.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.688
That's what I'm telling him.

08:35.775 --> 08:37.299
Look, this is the address
that's on the credit card.

08:37.385 --> 08:38.779
But these can't be
anywhere near here.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.389
You have to take them
to the gas station.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.390
I'm not even insured
to touch these things

08:42.477 --> 08:44.219
once they're off the truck.

08:44.306 --> 08:46.700
But you know, you want them
taken down to the gas station,

08:46.787 --> 08:48.484
they are motorcycles.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.051
LOIS: Is everything
okay out there, honey?

08:50.138 --> 08:51.574
Fine, no problem.

08:51.661 --> 08:52.967
Francis just wanted
to make sure

08:53.054 --> 08:55.012
that we weren't wearing
the same outfit tonight.

08:55.099 --> 08:57.058
Okay, just help me
get these in the garage.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.364
-Wow. Those are cool!
-[gasps]

08:59.451 --> 09:01.715
Listen, do not say
a word about this.

09:01.802 --> 09:04.239
If you just stay quiet,
I promise when you turn 21,

09:04.326 --> 09:07.024
I will take you on a trip
with me on a rocket ship.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.460
A rocket ship, Dewey.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.853
I swear on my life.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.333
I swear on everything
that is sacred,

09:11.420 --> 09:12.769
as God is my witness.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.163
Ow.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.730
Ooh, how did you...?
I don't care.

09:16.817 --> 09:18.166
Francis, come on, quickly.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.471
How do I...?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.604
Just kick it into neutral
and follow me.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.388
-[engine revving]
-[screaming]

09:26.870 --> 09:29.481
Just turn left and gun it!

09:29.569 --> 09:31.048
[screaming]

09:31.135 --> 09:32.397
[tires squealing]

09:34.008 --> 09:36.663
[screaming]

09:37.664 --> 09:39.056
I'll call you later!

09:39.143 --> 09:40.797
HAL: Love you!

09:48.892 --> 09:50.459
This should have been
the greatest day of our lives.

09:50.546 --> 09:51.634
Dad and Francis rode

09:51.721 --> 09:52.853
motorcycles
through the living room,

09:52.940 --> 09:53.854
and where were we?

09:53.941 --> 09:55.551
Hiding under our beds.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.597
"Oh, I'm really
looking forward to dinner."

09:57.684 --> 09:59.207
What a jerk.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.991
I don't know what
I'm gonna end up doing to him.

10:01.078 --> 10:01.949
[sighs]
All I know is

10:02.036 --> 10:03.472
every stroke of this brush

10:03.559 --> 10:05.126
strengthens my killing arm.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.823
Do you have another bucket?

10:06.910 --> 10:08.782
I can get started on the tracks
in the living room.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.001
Oh, I'll just end up
redoing them all myself anyway.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.524
Why don't you
just watch some TV?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.004
Then you'll be out
of the way.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.354
Lois!

10:16.441 --> 10:19.227
No one is as useless
as you think I am!

10:19.314 --> 10:20.881
My focus should be

10:20.968 --> 10:23.187
on hating my husband
and planning revenge,

10:23.274 --> 10:25.581
not worrying
about whether I belong here.

10:28.584 --> 10:31.282
You are absolutely right.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.721
I'm sorry.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.766
You deserve better.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.073
Thank you.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.770
I appreciate that.

10:43.381 --> 10:44.513
So now what?

10:44.600 --> 10:45.775
Well, I don't know.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.560
We're kind of
in uncharted waters here.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.912
Drink?

10:51.999 --> 10:52.869
Absolutely.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.306
[laughing]

10:55.393 --> 10:57.265
- Oh, man, what a day.
-[chuckling]

10:57.352 --> 10:58.527
What a ride.

10:58.614 --> 10:59.833
-Oh.
-That was fantastic.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.443
Yeah. Just wait.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.097
Tomorrow we go
around the lake

11:03.184 --> 11:05.665
to this funky old hot springs
you are gonna love.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.579
This is the same route
I used to take every month

11:07.667 --> 11:08.624
with my buddy, Roy,

11:08.711 --> 11:09.930
until he got dragged

11:10.017 --> 11:12.584
a quarter mile
by that school bus.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.064
Thanks for doing this, Dad.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.644
You know, son,

11:28.731 --> 11:29.819
you should always
pick battles

11:29.906 --> 11:31.821
that are big
enough to matter,

11:31.908 --> 11:34.476
but small
enough to win.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.566
Yeah, okay.

11:46.053 --> 11:49.665
I say life
is the only real counselor.

11:49.752 --> 11:50.666
Wisdom unfiltered

11:50.753 --> 11:52.102
through personal experience

11:52.189 --> 11:54.322
does not become part
of the moral tissue.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.499
Dad, you feeling okay?

11:57.586 --> 11:58.630
Ah.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.284
[laughing]:
Never mind.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.722
Listen, I have got something
really special for you.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.898
You know, it's kind
of a father-son thing

12:04.985 --> 12:06.290
to honor the occasion.

12:06.377 --> 12:07.988
It was a little expensive,

12:08.075 --> 12:11.121
but I am going to sit
with my 21-year-old son

12:11.208 --> 12:14.168
and share a 21-year-old
bottle of Scotch.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.039
[laughs]

12:16.126 --> 12:18.259
The guy at Liquor Clown said
this was the best.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.695
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.

12:19.782 --> 12:20.696
I'm sober now.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.132
I don't drink anymore.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.525
What?

12:23.612 --> 12:24.526
I'm sober now.

12:24.613 --> 12:25.701
I went to A.A.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.443
What?

12:28.530 --> 12:29.836
When did this happen?

12:29.923 --> 12:31.576
Last year.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.796
It just became a problem,
and I kind of bottomed out,

12:33.883 --> 12:35.363
so I decided
to get some help,

12:35.450 --> 12:37.582
and I've been sober
for six months now.

12:37.669 --> 12:39.628
And you didn't tell me
about this?

12:39.715 --> 12:41.064
Well, I'm telling you now.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.413
What good is it to tell me now?

12:42.500 --> 12:43.850
I'm your father.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.460
You could have come
to me about this.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.462
Instead you go to a bunch
of strangers

12:47.549 --> 12:48.637
with drinking problems?

12:48.724 --> 12:50.508
Well, I'm sorry... I guess.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.206
Which one of the 12 steps
is the one

12:52.293 --> 12:54.295
where you act like your
father doesn't exist?

12:54.382 --> 12:56.471
Dad, what's the big deal?
It was my problem.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.647
I went, and I did what
I needed to do to get help.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.605
I'm supposed to help you.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.956
I deserve to know.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.522
And meanwhile, I
plan this whole trip,

13:04.609 --> 13:06.046
and now I find
out you're sober,

13:06.133 --> 13:07.743
and I'm standing here
with a bottle of booze

13:07.830 --> 13:09.092
like some kind
of jackass.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.572
You know, it's just
a little tough...

13:11.616 --> 13:12.966
Wow.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.619
It's just little
tough to find out.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.404
Do you have any
other surprises for me?

13:16.491 --> 13:18.232
Do I have any grandchildren
I never met?

13:18.319 --> 13:19.363
Do you have
a boyfriend?!

13:19.450 --> 13:20.582
Dad, come on.

13:20.669 --> 13:21.931
This is a nice trip.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.628
I want to enjoy this.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.761
I'm going to bed.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.114
[sighs]

13:31.201 --> 13:33.638
I liked the thing you said
about picking battles.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.075
I got it off a billboard.

13:38.556 --> 13:41.516
Oh, look at this.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.997
You got Francis a watch.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.086
That was so
nice of you.

13:49.350 --> 13:52.440
This is a rare promotional
Doobie Brothers EP.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.442
Oh. Hal almost cried

13:54.529 --> 13:56.444
when he found this
at a yard sale.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.054
[laughs]

13:58.141 --> 13:59.099
[shatters]

14:00.622 --> 14:02.058
Still doesn't
seem like enough.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.494
Oh, honey, this is just

14:03.581 --> 14:05.714
how we get the creative
juices flowing.

14:05.801 --> 14:07.150
It's tough.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.760
You have to make
your husband miserable,

14:08.848 --> 14:10.458
but I have
to make mine miserable

14:10.545 --> 14:11.851
and make it a warning

14:11.938 --> 14:13.330
to the other three boys
in the house.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.071
Do men ever think about
what's gonna happen

14:15.158 --> 14:16.551
when they do these
stupid things?

14:16.638 --> 14:18.640
No, that's what's weird
about men, they never do.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.077
[laughs]
I guarantee you those two

14:21.164 --> 14:23.645
won't even think about the
consequences of their actions

14:23.732 --> 14:26.169
until five minutes
before they come home.

14:26.256 --> 14:27.997
So no matter how
low I set the bar,

14:28.084 --> 14:30.173
he'll still find a
way to crawl under it?

14:30.260 --> 14:32.654
You still think there's a bar.

14:32.741 --> 14:35.004
That's so cute.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.229
Look at him--
sleeping peacefully

14:42.316 --> 14:43.926
while I'm sitting here
going through hell.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.060
It's not fair.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.716
God, when did this room
get so small?

14:51.803 --> 14:53.109
I hate this.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.242
Reese, come on, go to sleep.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.766
I can't. I just keep thinking
about the beating.

14:57.853 --> 15:00.987
How long it'll hurt,
how bad it'll be,

15:01.074 --> 15:02.336
when it's gonna happen.

15:02.423 --> 15:05.034
What if it's on
the Fourth of July?

15:05.121 --> 15:06.949
That'll ruin it.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.472
I was gonna have pie.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.257
Dude, you have
to calm down.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.562
We can wait it out.

15:11.649 --> 15:12.824
We can beat this.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.130
I can't take this anymore.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.262
I'm going out there.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.916
It's probably me
he wants, anyway.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.134
Reese, that's stupid.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.788
There is no logic in that.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.137
Yes, there is.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.791
He is just getting
madder and madder.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.358
And the longer he has to wait,

15:24.445 --> 15:26.316
the worse
the beating's gonna be.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.798
Reese, think about it.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.321
Dewey got beat up even though
Randy wasn't after him.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.019
If you go out there now,
he'll beat you up

15:33.106 --> 15:34.455
even if you're
not the one he wants,

15:34.542 --> 15:35.673
just to send a message to me.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.545
I don't care anymore.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.025
But if you just wait,

15:39.112 --> 15:40.678
I'll figure out a way
to get out of this.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.245
I am not gonna wait while
you keep trying to come up

15:42.332 --> 15:43.812
with some plan that you'll
never come up with.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.727
I have to live in
the real world.

15:54.779 --> 15:55.693
[frying pan clanging]

15:55.780 --> 15:57.652
REESE:
Ow! Ow!

15:57.739 --> 15:59.088
Ow!

15:59.175 --> 16:02.700
[crying]:
Ow! Ow!

16:04.311 --> 16:05.965
Ah!

16:06.052 --> 16:09.055
This mud feels fantastic,
doesn't it?

16:09.142 --> 16:10.360
[man singing in Spanish]

16:10.447 --> 16:12.536
It's so soothing,

16:12.623 --> 16:14.712
I don't even care about
all the hundreds of people

16:14.799 --> 16:16.627
who left their pubes in here.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.804
Come on, Dad.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.806
We should be making the most
of this.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.852
You sulked all the way here,

16:23.939 --> 16:26.246
you sulked all the way
through the cold plunge,

16:26.333 --> 16:28.726
you even sulked when they
beat us with juniper branches.

16:28.813 --> 16:31.077
-[faucet squeaks]
-Stop being such a baby.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.904
I'm sorry I had such
high expectations

16:32.992 --> 16:34.428
for this trip.

16:35.864 --> 16:36.952
For all the trouble

16:37.039 --> 16:38.432
I went to, I thought maybe

16:38.519 --> 16:40.042
I could be an important
part of your life.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.436
This has been
a nice trip, Dad.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.699
This is exactly
how I was hoping it would be.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.051
It just gets
to me, Francis.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.531
I mean, how did we
get to this point

16:50.618 --> 16:52.402
where you're doing all
this stuff without me?

16:52.489 --> 16:54.056
I mean, you're-you're
traveling everywhere,

16:54.143 --> 16:55.797
you're getting married,

16:55.884 --> 16:57.233
you're doing all these things
without even telling me.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.539
And now I find out
you even went to A.A.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.149
without telling me?

17:00.236 --> 17:01.411
I can't help it, Dad.

17:01.498 --> 17:02.717
I'm a grownup now.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.109
It happens.

17:05.849 --> 17:07.722
And I missed it.

17:08.896 --> 17:11.551
I mean, here you've grown
into this nice,

17:11.638 --> 17:13.728
responsible, decent man,

17:13.815 --> 17:15.772
and I didn't get
to be there for it.

17:15.859 --> 17:18.428
I missed you
being there, too, Dad.

17:19.733 --> 17:22.127
It kind of makes me happy
you feel sad about it.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.262
Well, that's
something, anyway, heh.

17:26.348 --> 17:27.568
Yeah.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.009
[faucet squeaks, timer dings]

17:34.096 --> 17:35.837
-Five minutes.
-[both gasp]

17:35.924 --> 17:38.100
Holy crap! We've got
to get back home!

17:38.187 --> 17:39.797
Do you realize how
much trouble we're in?

17:39.884 --> 17:40.842
Oh, God, you're right.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.235
We're dead. We can't go back.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.410
No, no, no, no, wait.
I'll think of something.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.846
I've been married
for 20 years,

17:44.933 --> 17:46.326
and I've gotten out
of a lot of trouble.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.545
Wait, how is it 20 years
if I'm 21?

17:48.632 --> 17:50.504
Just shut up and let me think.

17:50.591 --> 17:51.548
Okay.

17:51.635 --> 17:52.549
I have something.

17:52.636 --> 17:53.898
-What?
-[grunts]

17:53.985 --> 17:57.032
Ow! God.
What the hell was that for?

17:57.119 --> 17:58.599
You were in a terrible
motorcycle accident

17:58.686 --> 17:59.948
that taught you a lesson.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.645
Now it's not gonna
solve everything,

18:01.732 --> 18:03.386
but it's gonna make your
apology go down a lot easier

18:03.473 --> 18:04.561
because it makes
them right,

18:04.648 --> 18:06.259
which is what
they really want.

18:06.346 --> 18:07.738
Dad, you're brilliant.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.305
There's no time for
that. Just do me now.

18:09.392 --> 18:10.654
You're gonna want to grab

18:10.741 --> 18:12.091
between the second
and third knuckle,

18:12.178 --> 18:13.744
and go up and back
in one smooth motion.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.703
But just those two, so I can
still work the throttle.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.707
I love you, Dad.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.665
I love you, too, son.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.232
[snap]

18:24.799 --> 18:26.148
You were right, Dewey.

18:26.235 --> 18:27.541
I can't tell you how
much better I feel.

18:27.628 --> 18:28.803
Told ya.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.413
It's really freeing.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.675
Especially knowing

18:31.762 --> 18:33.677
he still wants
the other brother.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.811
Malcolm, you got
to go out there.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.204
It's time.
He wants you.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.509
No. By October,

18:39.596 --> 18:40.815
I'll be strong enough
to beat him.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.512
Come on, Malcolm,
there's school tomorrow.

18:42.599 --> 18:44.384
You can pretend to be
sick for a few days,

18:44.471 --> 18:45.559
but sooner or later,

18:45.646 --> 18:46.603
Mom gets involved.
Then what?

18:46.690 --> 18:47.822
I'll think of something.

18:47.909 --> 18:48.910
Thinking won't do it,
Malcolm.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.955
This is not a smart thing.

18:51.042 --> 18:52.043
It's a life thing.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.176
Randy is like an earthquake.

18:54.263 --> 18:55.699
It's just something
that's gonna happen.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.136
DEWEY: Seriously, Malcolm,

18:57.223 --> 18:58.137
the longer you try
to put this off,

18:58.224 --> 18:59.399
the worse
it's gonna to be.

18:59.486 --> 19:00.704
I could tell
he was holding back.

19:00.791 --> 19:01.966
He's got a lot farther
he could go.

19:02.053 --> 19:04.273
This is nothing.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.666
No, I'm not giving up.

19:05.753 --> 19:06.797
I don't give up.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.234
I'm not a quitter.

19:08.321 --> 19:09.626
If I have a problem,
I think, and work,

19:09.713 --> 19:11.454
and keep working on it
until I solve it.

19:11.541 --> 19:14.805
Okay, name one time that's
ever worked out for you.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.285
-Well...
-Did it work

19:16.372 --> 19:18.113
five years ago when
your hamster died,

19:18.200 --> 19:19.549
and you spent so many

19:19.636 --> 19:21.247
hours giving it CPR
that the doctors had

19:21.334 --> 19:23.814
to put a shunt in your mouth
to help the sores drain?

19:23.901 --> 19:25.990
REESE: Did it work with
that girl you kept hounding

19:26.077 --> 19:27.818
because you thought
she was so close to liking you

19:27.905 --> 19:28.950
until she finally maced you?

19:29.037 --> 19:31.605
No, but I could...

19:31.692 --> 19:33.911
I could...

19:33.998 --> 19:36.697
Malcolm, think about it.

19:37.741 --> 19:39.613
[sighs]

19:39.700 --> 19:41.571
You're right.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.617
[sighs] I really
have to go out there.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.625
I appreciate you guys
looking out for me.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.807
We didn't think
you'd be so easy to convince.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.691
No, not him.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.389
Where's the red-haired brother?

20:16.476 --> 20:18.956
There is no red-haired brother.
This is it.

20:19.043 --> 20:21.045
Shoot. I have the wrong house.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.266
Where's that house
with the assbag

20:24.353 --> 20:25.876
who works with
handicapped kids?

20:25.963 --> 20:27.226
Oh, that's Eddie Jeffers.

20:27.313 --> 20:28.444
He lives on Comstock.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.664
[groans]

20:32.274 --> 20:34.363
You guys got pounded,
and I got off scot-free.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.887
Hah! Now whose philosophy
looks stupid?

20:36.974 --> 20:38.715
You thought
I couldn't come up with...

20:42.197 --> 20:44.068
Guys, wait.

20:44.155 --> 20:45.200
What if we do this tomorrow?

20:45.287 --> 20:46.375
You'll be rested.

20:46.462 --> 20:47.724
Take some time first.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.509
LOIS:
We worked so hard

20:49.596 --> 20:51.902
and spent so much
on Francis's dinner,

20:51.989 --> 20:54.253
it's nice we can all
finally enjoy it.

20:55.558 --> 20:56.777
More steak, honey?

20:58.648 --> 21:00.563
[blender whirring]

21:51.048 --> 21:53.442
