WEBVTT

00:05.974 --> 00:09.603
You sure like nachos.
Problem is, they're not-cho' nachos.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.538
She can't hear you.

00:12.614 --> 00:15.708
She's chowing down
on the "all you can eat" love buffet.

00:18.987 --> 00:21.785
It's true. When she's like this,
she's doesn't know what she's doing.

00:21.857 --> 00:23.449
I'll show you.

00:27.029 --> 00:28.656
- Miley!
- What?

00:28.730 --> 00:29.924
Just go ask Josh out.

00:29.998 --> 00:32.330
I can't. I'm from Tennessee.
We don't do that.

00:32.401 --> 00:35.529
Well, you're in California now
and we do do that.

00:36.939 --> 00:39.339
- What?
- You said "do-do. "

00:42.411 --> 00:43.605
Grow up.

00:43.679 --> 00:45.874
You're the one that can't ask a guy out.

00:45.948 --> 00:48.280
He's not just a guy.
He's a ninth grader.

00:48.350 --> 00:50.511
I can't just put
eighth grade moves on him.

00:50.586 --> 00:51.644
Good point.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.086
And besides, he probably
doesn't even know you're alive.

00:54.156 --> 00:58.058
You're like some dried up insect
on the windshield of his life.

00:59.428 --> 01:00.452
Not even in the center,

01:00.529 --> 01:03.157
you're way off to the side
where the wipers don't reach.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.424
- Lilly.
- What?

01:06.501 --> 01:09.026
This is officially the worst pep talk ever.

01:09.104 --> 01:11.265
All right, you want a pep talk?

01:11.974 --> 01:14.704
You're Hannah
"Teen Pop Sensation" Montana.

01:14.776 --> 01:17.176
You're gonna be out in front
of thousands of people Saturday night.

01:17.246 --> 01:20.511
- Just pretend he's one of them.
- You're right. That's all he is.

01:20.582 --> 01:24.541
One guy. I can do this.
I'll just channel Hannah.

01:29.691 --> 01:32.660
Hello, Josh Woods.
You ready to rock tonight?

01:33.729 --> 01:34.821
What?

01:34.897 --> 01:37.627
Thank you! Good night, everybody!

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:49.111 --> 01:50.476
<i> Come on!</i>

01:50.545 --> 01:53.070
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

01:54.549 --> 01:58.110
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

01:58.186 --> 02:01.553
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

02:02.157 --> 02:06.150
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

02:06.962 --> 02:10.363
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

02:10.431 --> 02:15.631
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:15.704 --> 02:19.572
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:19.641 --> 02:21.700
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

02:21.777 --> 02:23.472
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

02:23.545 --> 02:27.572
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:27.649 --> 02:29.446
<i>Mix it all together</i>

02:29.518 --> 02:32.749
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

02:37.459 --> 02:40.917
Then I ate a napkin and then
Jackson was all, "You said do-do,"

02:40.996 --> 02:43.487
and then Lilly was all,
"Bug on a windshield,"

02:43.565 --> 02:46.864
and then I was all,
"Good night, everybody!"

02:47.402 --> 02:49.802
And that's why we have to move.

02:50.772 --> 02:52.034
Sorry, darling.

02:54.109 --> 02:56.236
- What?
- Nothing.

02:57.245 --> 03:00.612
Hello. Hold on. Mile, it's for you.

03:00.682 --> 03:03.845
I can't talk to anyone right now.
Could you just make something up?

03:03.919 --> 03:08.015
Sorry, Josh, she's in the bathroom,
could be a while.

03:08.090 --> 03:09.216
No!

03:09.624 --> 03:11.285
Hold on, sounds like she's finishing up.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.055
Give me that phone.

03:13.128 --> 03:14.789
Hi, this is Miley.

03:15.964 --> 03:17.591
"It could be a while. "

03:17.666 --> 03:20.328
You, sir, do not know
how good you are.

03:20.936 --> 03:23.461
Well, next time I'm letting
the machine pick it up.

03:23.538 --> 03:25.563
You realize how much easier life was

03:25.640 --> 03:28.370
when she believed
boys still had cooties?

03:29.111 --> 03:32.512
I can't believe it.
I'm going out with a ninth grader!

03:34.282 --> 03:37.080
Well, don't believe it,
'cause I'm not letting you go!

03:40.122 --> 03:43.523
- But, Daddy...
- But nothing. He's a year older.

03:43.692 --> 03:48.425
In teenage boy years
that adds up to, let's see, carry the one,

03:48.497 --> 03:50.556
equals, ain't gonna happen.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.563
This is so unfair.

03:54.870 --> 03:56.394
Sad face.

03:57.639 --> 03:59.368
Not-buying-it face.

04:01.243 --> 04:04.406
Come on, Dad, it wasn't that long ago
that I was a ninth grader.

04:04.479 --> 04:09.041
And if he's anything like I was,
you need to meet that boy.

04:13.655 --> 04:16.488
He's coming up from the walk.
He is so cute.

04:16.558 --> 04:18.526
But we've gotta be calm. Just be calm.

04:18.593 --> 04:21.322
Honey, if I was any calmer I'd be dead.

04:22.197 --> 04:25.291
Hey, Dad, big favor,
don't try to be funny with Josh.

04:25.367 --> 04:27.198
'Cause you ain't funny.

04:27.803 --> 04:30.772
I don't know,
I crack myself up all the time.

04:31.540 --> 04:34.031
What do you call a pig
that knows karate?

04:34.109 --> 04:35.474
Pork chop! Ha!

04:37.279 --> 04:40.146
Daddy, please, I'm begging you,
don't talk.

04:41.783 --> 04:44.274
I'm just gonna sit on the couch
and look casual,

04:44.352 --> 04:46.377
like I live here all the time.

04:46.455 --> 04:47.717
Good thinking.

04:50.992 --> 04:54.018
Hey, Miley. Whoa, you look hot.

04:56.698 --> 04:59.861
Well, hi. I'm the hot chick's father.
How do I look?

05:01.470 --> 05:03.597
Very handsome, sir.

05:04.172 --> 05:05.161
Nice try.

05:05.273 --> 05:09.266
Now take your foot out of your mouth,
come on in here, and let's start over.

05:09.344 --> 05:12.609
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I'm Josh, sir.

05:13.048 --> 05:15.141
Well, you met, you bonded,
enough said, bye-bye.

05:15.217 --> 05:17.378
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.

05:17.452 --> 05:21.513
Why not fast? Fast is good. Fast food,
fast lane, fast forward, bye-bye.

05:21.890 --> 05:24.051
Wow, cool guitars.

05:24.126 --> 05:25.388
Oh, you like guitars, do you?

05:25.460 --> 05:27.758
Oh, yeah.
And these are pretty good ones.

05:27.829 --> 05:31.196
Not as good as a Deifenbacher,
but you know that.

05:31.266 --> 05:33.166
No, I don't know that.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.869
There goes the other foot.

05:35.937 --> 05:38.701
Look, sir, I'm not saying
it wasn't a good guitar in its day.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.070
In its day?

05:40.142 --> 05:44.636
Ooh, sounds like you've been a
musician for a long time. Like 30 years.

05:44.713 --> 05:46.681
Oh, wait, that's me.

05:48.783 --> 05:53.049
Well, isn't that interesting?
You have your opinion and he has his.

05:53.121 --> 05:55.919
You gotta love a guy
who isn't afraid to say how he feels.

05:55.991 --> 05:58.755
I'm a little afraid
to say anything right now.

05:58.827 --> 06:02.058
No, you're not. If everybody says
that they like hamburgers,

06:02.130 --> 06:05.725
he's not afraid to say
that he likes hotdogs, right?

06:05.800 --> 06:07.324
Okay.

06:08.136 --> 06:09.865
And some people like skiing

06:09.938 --> 06:12.964
and he's not afraid to say
that he likes snowboarding.

06:13.041 --> 06:14.303
Yeah.

06:14.976 --> 06:19.413
And some people like Hannah Montana
and I'm not afraid to say she stinks.

06:21.183 --> 06:22.582
What?

06:23.919 --> 06:26.649
Son of a gun, that boy's got three feet.

06:33.995 --> 06:40.594
Hello, I am the Jackson-ator.
These will not be back.

06:44.372 --> 06:48.399
Whoa, rock and roll! Sharon!

06:50.745 --> 06:54.272
- Are you always this funny?
- Well, it depends.

06:54.349 --> 06:56.943
- Do you like funny?
- Oh, I love funny.

06:59.054 --> 07:01.147
Well, then I am hysterical.

07:02.390 --> 07:04.858
Did you hear the one
about the pig who knows karate?

07:04.926 --> 07:06.553
- Pork chop? Ha!
- Ha!

07:07.996 --> 07:09.827
Can you spell "destiny"?

07:10.131 --> 07:12.190
I'm Jackson.
I haven't seen you around here.

07:12.267 --> 07:13.996
I'm Olivia. I go to school back east.

07:14.069 --> 07:16.697
I'm here on break
looking for something fun to do.

07:16.771 --> 07:20.002
Well, look no further.
Mr. Fun gets off in about ten minutes.

07:20.075 --> 07:22.009
Sounds great.
I'll just go pack up my stuff.

07:22.077 --> 07:23.510
All right!

07:26.348 --> 07:28.009
Yes! I'm awake!

07:30.118 --> 07:32.177
Hey, my brother from another mother.
What's cracking?

07:32.254 --> 07:36.384
Coop, I just hooked up with the
most amazing girl who's totally into me,

07:36.458 --> 07:38.551
and I didn't even have to tell her
that I owned a Ferrari,

07:38.627 --> 07:41.892
or have six months to live
or any of the usual stuff.

07:41.963 --> 07:44.625
That's my dawg.
Putting it down for the ladies.

07:44.699 --> 07:45.723
You should've seen me.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.997
And tonight, she's gonna find out
that even my moves have moves.

07:49.070 --> 07:51.265
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

07:54.743 --> 07:58.110
Don't do that in public.

07:59.114 --> 08:01.207
Oh, hey, check it out, there she is.

08:01.283 --> 08:03.012
- Whoa.
- You bet, "Whoa. "

08:03.084 --> 08:06.178
No, no, no. I mean,
whoa, that's my little sister, fool!

08:08.023 --> 08:10.924
I meant, whoa, I didn't know.

08:11.393 --> 08:13.793
- Olivia.
- Yes, big brother?

08:13.862 --> 08:16.262
Get over here.
Did you agree to go out with this guy?

08:16.331 --> 08:21.428
Is that what he said? Shame on you.
What kind of girl do you think I am?

08:24.406 --> 08:26.966
- But I thought...
- Oh, I know what you thought.

08:27.042 --> 08:29.772
And you better stop thinking it
about my little sister.

08:29.844 --> 08:30.868
Mmm-hmm.

08:30.945 --> 08:34.745
'Cause when my big brother tells me to
stay away from somebody, I stay away.

08:34.816 --> 08:35.804
Mmm-hmm.

08:43.491 --> 08:48.292
Sharon! I'm so confused.

08:55.737 --> 08:57.068
This is so frustrating.

08:57.138 --> 09:00.665
I spent all day yesterday trying
to make Josh like Hannah Montana.

09:00.742 --> 09:02.767
- How'd it go?
- It went really well.

09:02.844 --> 09:05.540
He loves Hannah Montana now
and we're getting married.

09:05.613 --> 09:08.241
How do you think it went, you donut?

09:08.550 --> 09:09.642
I'm gonna go with not so well.

09:10.819 --> 09:13.515
- We have a winner!
- Lilly, I'm serious.

09:13.588 --> 09:15.783
How am I gonna go out with a guy
who doesn't like half of me?

09:15.857 --> 09:17.722
He doesn't know
he doesn't like half of you.

09:17.792 --> 09:20.260
So just let him think the half of you
he likes is all of you.

09:20.328 --> 09:21.920
As long as the other half
keeps her mouth shut,

09:21.996 --> 09:24.897
the three of you
should make a beautiful couple.

09:25.233 --> 09:27.167
I never get chick math.

09:27.869 --> 09:30.804
She's right.
Why should I have to give Josh up?

09:30.872 --> 09:33.067
Yeah. And it's not like he's ever
gonna be in the same place

09:33.141 --> 09:34.802
with you and Hannah.

09:34.876 --> 09:36.241
Hey, Miley.

09:37.045 --> 09:38.842
You know what you said
about Hannah Montana?

09:38.913 --> 09:40.278
I decided to give her a chance.

09:40.348 --> 09:41.747
Really? That's great!

09:41.816 --> 09:45.582
Yeah, so tonight I'm taking you
to a Hannah Montana concert.

09:46.187 --> 09:52.615
Really? That's even greater.
Thank you.

09:55.830 --> 09:59.288
And she thought it didn't go well.
Who's the donut now?

10:00.535 --> 10:01.832
Still you.

10:07.308 --> 10:10.243
Hannah! Hannah!
Hannah! Hannah!

10:10.311 --> 10:14.213
This is what an actual
Hannah Montana concert looks like.

10:14.282 --> 10:16.648
You mean, you've never been to one?

10:16.718 --> 10:18.515
Well, I've tried,

10:18.586 --> 10:22.078
but somehow I've always been busy
doing something else.

10:22.490 --> 10:25.288
Well, tonight, this is all you have to do.

10:25.627 --> 10:27.424
You know, I was really nervous
when you first asked me,

10:27.495 --> 10:29.861
but I'm just totally glad I said yes.

10:29.931 --> 10:31.262
Me, too.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.798
I just hope she's not one of those divas
who keeps everyone waiting.

10:36.871 --> 10:39.237
- I totally hate that.
- Me, too.

10:40.175 --> 10:42.370
I'm gonna go get a soft pretzel.

10:43.244 --> 10:44.472
You're on.

10:49.284 --> 10:52.549
Oh, my gosh, it's Josh.
What a coincidence.

10:52.620 --> 10:55.453
So, what do you think
of Hannah Montana so far?

10:56.057 --> 10:57.786
She hasn't come on yet.

10:59.194 --> 11:01.992
Right, I'm supposed
to ask you that later.

11:08.770 --> 11:11.364
- You seen Hannah?
- Not since sound check.

11:11.439 --> 11:14.272
She's on in one minute.
Where is that girl?

11:27.755 --> 11:30.315
Did you just come out
of that dressing room?

11:30.391 --> 11:31.483
Yeah.

11:31.559 --> 11:32.992
I was just in there
and you weren't there.

11:33.061 --> 11:36.519
Yeah, I was. You're losing it, Daddy.

11:38.266 --> 11:41.167
- You think I'm losing it, Fred?
- It's Jimmy.

11:42.737 --> 11:45.934
Call the cows home, Robbie Ray,
you are losing it.

11:49.444 --> 11:53.938
<i>Hey, everybody. Sorry I'm late. </i>
<i>Hope nobody thinks I'm a diva!</i>

11:57.952 --> 12:01.854
That's right, sausage, pepperoni,
and what the heck, onions.

12:01.923 --> 12:04.118
I'm not kissing anybody tonight.

12:05.293 --> 12:07.261
No, I am not ugly.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.460
I'm a 6'4" beach god.

12:15.403 --> 12:19.305
Jackson, it's me, Olivia. Open up.

12:19.374 --> 12:20.807
Olivia?

12:29.817 --> 12:30.841
Hey.

12:30.919 --> 12:34.753
Olivia's here and it's time
to get your Saturday night on!

12:35.456 --> 12:36.514
I don't understand.

12:36.591 --> 12:38.456
You were totally different today
with Cooper.

12:38.526 --> 12:39.993
Well, that was Saturday afternoon.

12:40.061 --> 12:43.030
The moon has come up
and I am coming out!

12:44.198 --> 12:46.359
I heard there's gonna be
a party over here.

12:46.434 --> 12:47.594
Well, who said that?

12:47.669 --> 12:50.934
Me. Just now. Come on, boy, keep up.

12:51.539 --> 12:54.667
Popcorn, oh,
with the movie theater butter.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.337
Yeah, Cooper's not gonna be
very happy that you're here.

12:58.413 --> 13:00.540
I know. That's why I didn't tell him.

13:00.615 --> 13:03.778
Now, let's get you on the phone
and let's people this party.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.682
Wait, what happened to all that,

13:05.753 --> 13:08.745
"When my big brother says
to stay away, I stay away"?

13:08.823 --> 13:09.812
Mmm-hmm.

13:11.459 --> 13:15.156
Cooper thinks I'm a sweet little girl
who needs to be protected.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.662
And what he doesn't know
won't hurt him.

13:17.799 --> 13:19.232
Jackson, it's Coop.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.461
Yeah, well it might hurt me.
You gotta go!

13:21.536 --> 13:23.026
No way. This is my last night in town

13:23.104 --> 13:26.039
and I'm not gonna let it be spoiled
by Cooper the party pooper.

13:26.107 --> 13:27.972
I'll hide, you get rid of him.

13:28.042 --> 13:30.636
Well, I don't know,
I've never lied to him before.

13:30.712 --> 13:33.374
Please? For me?

13:36.184 --> 13:40.018
Well, there's a first time for everything.
You wait out there.

13:40.088 --> 13:41.146
Okay.

13:43.157 --> 13:44.954
Come on in, Coop.

13:45.460 --> 13:48.361
Just getting my Saturday night on,
you know.

13:56.004 --> 13:58.529
Get it off before you hurt yourself.

13:59.707 --> 14:02.699
That's a good idea.
That's some great advice.

14:03.077 --> 14:04.442
Well, thanks for stopping by.

14:04.512 --> 14:07.242
Give me a call when you make it home
so I know that you're safe.

14:07.315 --> 14:09.783
Look, look, look. I know
I came down hard on you yesterday

14:09.851 --> 14:11.079
and I just wanna make sure we're cool.

14:11.152 --> 14:14.918
We're totally cool.
Now drive safe, we'll see you tomorrow.

14:15.323 --> 14:18.781
Slow down, I rented a few DVDs,
thought we could chill.

14:20.395 --> 14:23.762
Ooh! Popcorn with
the movie theater butter.

14:24.732 --> 14:27.166
You knew I was coming all along.

14:27.235 --> 14:30.261
Believe me, I had no idea.

14:36.511 --> 14:40.607
<i> I'm just like anybody else,</i>
<i>can't you tell</i>

14:40.682 --> 14:42.513
<i>I hold the key, the key</i>

14:42.583 --> 14:43.811
<i>To both realities</i>

14:43.885 --> 14:44.943
The key!

14:45.019 --> 14:48.614
<i>The girl that I want you to know</i>
<i>If only I could show</i>

14:49.123 --> 14:52.388
<i>The other side, the other side</i>
<i>I want you to see</i>

14:52.460 --> 14:53.484
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

14:53.561 --> 14:57.327
<i>The other side, the other side</i>
<i>The other side of me</i>

14:57.665 --> 15:01.761
<i>The other side, the other side</i>
<i>I want you to see</i>

15:01.836 --> 15:05.636
<i>The other side, the other side of me</i>

15:08.309 --> 15:13.372
And now, give it up for the
fabulous fingers of Jesse J, lead guitar!

15:16.617 --> 15:19.347
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?

15:19.420 --> 15:22.355
Nervous stomach. Could be a while.

15:29.530 --> 15:30.861
Thank you.

15:36.170 --> 15:37.865
This is the longest guitar solo ever.

15:37.939 --> 15:40.931
I know. He rocks! Sit down.

15:46.314 --> 15:49.579
You wouldn't believe the line
for the soft pretzels.

15:50.084 --> 15:53.485
So, how about that first song?
Pretty awesome, huh?

15:54.422 --> 15:55.980
It was okay.

15:56.057 --> 15:59.549
Okay? Not even really okay?

16:00.661 --> 16:03.391
- I guess I'm into hip-hop.
- Hip-hop?

16:04.165 --> 16:06.565
Yeah, does she ever do any of that?

16:07.401 --> 16:09.767
I have a feeling she will tonight.

16:10.938 --> 16:14.931
Is that pretzel making you thirsty?
Do you need to go get a soda?

16:15.676 --> 16:17.735
You know what? I do.

16:17.812 --> 16:20.508
Wait, here,
you can have some of mine.

16:23.251 --> 16:25.481
I'm sorry. My bad.

16:26.087 --> 16:28.988
I'm having so much fun
with you, Josh. Bye.

16:33.761 --> 16:36.195
<i> I bet you didn't know</i>
<i>that this girl could really go</i>

16:36.264 --> 16:39.563
<i>and I'm gonna give you mo'</i>
<i>'cause you spent a lot of dough</i>

16:39.634 --> 16:41.397
<i>coming to my show</i>

16:42.170 --> 16:44.229
<i>Do-de-do-de-do-de-do</i>

16:44.305 --> 16:45.602
<i>Word!</i>

16:48.609 --> 16:50.770
Do-de-do-de-do-de-do?

16:51.546 --> 16:54.208
Don't look at me, I didn't write that.

16:57.585 --> 17:01.385
<i>Hey! Ho! Say hey! Ho!</i>

17:01.455 --> 17:05.618
Hey! Ho! Say hey! Ho!

17:05.693 --> 17:07.490
Hey! Ho!

17:07.994 --> 17:09.895
Hey! Ho!

17:21.943 --> 17:25.002
Man, I think I'm coming down
with something.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.638
- Well, keep it off of me.
- I'll try.

17:31.619 --> 17:32.984
Better?

17:33.054 --> 17:36.251
I'm getting out of here
before you cough up an alien.

17:36.791 --> 17:40.454
That's a good idea.
Better safe than sorry.

17:40.528 --> 17:45.090
- And listen, about my sister...
- Hey. Not another word, please.

17:46.367 --> 17:49.359
I know I'm a little overprotective,
but I just care about her a lot.

17:49.437 --> 17:52.463
And I appreciate you backing off.
You're a good friend.

17:55.710 --> 17:58.076
Yeah, a real good friend.

17:58.179 --> 18:01.546
I thought he'd never leave.
It's freezing out there.

18:01.616 --> 18:03.516
But nothing a good party
can't warm up. Hey!

18:05.786 --> 18:07.686
Hey, yeah, okay, hold on. Hold on.

18:08.856 --> 18:11.416
Didn't you hear your brother?
I'm a good friend.

18:11.492 --> 18:14.928
And good friends do not party
with their friends' sisters,

18:14.996 --> 18:16.793
no matter how much they want to.

18:16.864 --> 18:20.265
Wow, you really are a nice guy.
My luck.

18:20.334 --> 18:24.327
And you really gotta go. My luck.
Come on.

18:25.039 --> 18:28.031
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

18:28.309 --> 18:30.675
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

18:31.345 --> 18:33.506
Hey, I forgot my... Dang!

18:33.581 --> 18:37.108
I just came over to say goodbye
and he was all over me.

18:37.652 --> 18:39.586
You are in trouble.

18:40.521 --> 18:42.045
Well, that is so not what happened!

18:42.123 --> 18:45.456
- Olivia, wait in the car.
- Yes, big brother. Shame on you.

18:47.728 --> 18:50.822
Man, she's not telling you the truth.
She came over here.

18:50.898 --> 18:53.992
- She was all over me. I swear, Coop.
- Save it.

18:54.068 --> 18:56.593
I can't believe you're trying to blame
my sweet, innocent sister for this.

18:56.671 --> 18:58.605
Well, I'm telling you,
she's not sweet and innocent.

18:58.673 --> 19:00.664
Okay, you know what? That's enough.

19:00.741 --> 19:02.231
If there's one thing I know
about my sister,

19:02.310 --> 19:05.575
it's that she would never be
all over any guy she just met.

19:09.617 --> 19:11.175
Pizza's here.

19:11.919 --> 19:13.784
He was all over me.

19:14.922 --> 19:18.756
Olivia, get in the car.
You and I are gonna have a little talk.

19:19.727 --> 19:21.126
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:28.502 --> 19:31.232
She already gave you your tip, big boy.

19:43.751 --> 19:46.311
Where've you been?
You're missing the whole concert.

19:46.387 --> 19:48.378
That drink line went on forever.

19:48.456 --> 19:51.118
No, it didn't.
There were, like, three people in it.

19:51.192 --> 19:54.286
Then you wouldn't mind
going to get another one.

19:54.862 --> 19:56.159
Oh, man!

19:56.864 --> 20:00.197
So, what do you think
of Hannah Montana now?

20:00.267 --> 20:02.258
I'm still not feeling it.

20:03.104 --> 20:05.470
What do you want her to do,
surf the crowd?

20:05.539 --> 20:07.404
Yeah. That'd be cool.

20:08.209 --> 20:09.801
Surf the crowd.

20:10.878 --> 20:13.870
Well, then I guess I gotta go
get another pretzel!

20:15.349 --> 20:17.146
Having fun crowd surfing.

20:17.218 --> 20:19.709
Please don't drop me.
Please don't drop...

20:19.787 --> 20:21.982
- Where'd he go?
- He left.

20:22.490 --> 20:24.856
- What?
- I'm sorry.

20:30.331 --> 20:34.097
He said it was the worst date
of his life? Really?

20:34.835 --> 20:36.325
I'm sorry.

20:36.404 --> 20:38.531
Did he say anything else?

20:38.806 --> 20:43.038
He also said Hannah Montana stinks,
but we decided to leave that out.

20:43.644 --> 20:47.171
I mean, why hurt you any more
than you already are?

20:48.249 --> 20:49.910
Leave. Now.

20:53.621 --> 20:55.953
- The rap was interesting...
- Go!

20:58.526 --> 21:00.289
I cannot believe I just blew it.

21:00.361 --> 21:02.727
- You didn't blow it.
- Yes, I did.

21:03.264 --> 21:06.392
I couldn't be happy
with a cute guy liking just me.

21:06.467 --> 21:10.597
I tried to make him like Hannah, too,
and now he hates both of us.

21:11.005 --> 21:13.940
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
that's his loss.

21:14.008 --> 21:18.104
But I'm butting in. I'm sure Lilly
was just getting ready to say that.

21:18.779 --> 21:19.973
Yeah.

21:22.116 --> 21:24.141
What was I gonna say next?

21:24.685 --> 21:28.587
That someday she'll find a guy
that likes everything about her.

21:29.223 --> 21:31.657
Won't be anything left to change.

21:33.160 --> 21:36.561
Thanks, Lilly.
You always know what to say.

21:36.931 --> 21:39.161
Sometimes it just comes to me.

21:40.701 --> 21:43.329
Well, come on, girls, it's time to go.

21:43.904 --> 21:47.067
<i>'Cause it's the end of</i>
<i>the show and we're walking to the do'</i>

21:47.141 --> 21:49.871
<i>And we're heading for</i>
<i>the big black stretch limo</i>

21:49.944 --> 21:52.606
Dad, remember. You ain't funny.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.113
And you can't rap.

21:54.181 --> 21:56.513
<i>Do-de-do-de-do-de-do</i>

21:57.785 --> 22:01.744
<i> You get the best</i>
<i>of both worlds</i>

22:01.822 --> 22:03.687
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

22:03.757 --> 22:05.384
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

22:05.459 --> 22:09.520
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

22:10.030 --> 22:11.429
<i>Mix it all together</i>

22:11.499 --> 22:15.162
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

22:16.637 --> 22:19.731
<i>The best of both worlds</i>

22:19.807 --> 22:20.831
<i>Yeah!</i>

22:20.908 --> 22:23.240
Everybody wants to be a star.

22:23.310 --> 22:24.470
- Next!
- Next!

22:24.578 --> 22:27.638
