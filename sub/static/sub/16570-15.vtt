00:05.088 --> 00:10.151
Well, good morning to you, Joel.

00:11.194 --> 00:13.856
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

00:20.036 --> 00:21.799
Another late night, huh?

00:21.971 --> 00:24.166
I'm sorry, did I wake you when I came in?

00:24.340 --> 00:28.106
No. But I can tell exactly what you did
after you got home.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.908
You poured a glass of wine,
you had some popcorn...

00:34.918 --> 00:38.149
...then fell asleep watching the TV.

00:40.323 --> 00:41.847
Oh.

00:43.393 --> 00:45.623
Let me ask you a question.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.888
- Are your shoes afraid of the dark?
- No.

00:48.064 --> 00:50.760
Then could you put them in the closet,
please?

00:55.438 --> 01:00.341
Is it too much to ask to at least put your
dirty dishes in the sink after you use them?

01:00.510 --> 01:04.275
I worked a 14-hour day yesterday.
I was really tired when I got home.

01:04.447 --> 01:06.506
I'll straighten up now.
Why are you so mad?

01:07.217 --> 01:09.583
I just told you.

01:11.421 --> 01:13.184
The house is a mess.

01:15.358 --> 01:17.087
But you seem extra upset.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:30.573 --> 01:31.835
One second.

01:34.377 --> 01:36.902
Wait, I... Wait.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.048
Wait. Wait, wait, don't...

01:41.818 --> 01:44.184
Walk out.

01:51.394 --> 01:53.885
- Come in.
- Sorry, Will. I...

01:58.301 --> 01:59.893
Oh.

02:00.069 --> 02:02.663
- Captain Raydor, hi.
- Chief Johnson.

02:03.873 --> 02:06.808
Thanks for taking time
to join us this morning.

02:07.977 --> 02:10.571
- I left just as soon as I...
- Sit, sit.

02:13.483 --> 02:16.316
Captain Raydor has come to me
with a delicate situation...

02:16.486 --> 02:19.819
...involving one of her detectives
in the Force Investigation Division.

02:19.989 --> 02:24.756
Before we begin to discuss this issue, chief,
I would like you and your division...

02:24.928 --> 02:29.422
...to keep this investigation into Detective
Moore's private life entirely confidential.

02:29.599 --> 02:34.093
Who's Detective Moore? Wait a minute.
I can't promise confidentiality...

02:34.270 --> 02:37.603
...unless I know exactly what it is
that you're asking me to do.

02:41.277 --> 02:42.437
A few weeks ago...

02:42.612 --> 02:46.844
...Captain Raydor began to notice changes
in one of her detectives, Ally Moore.

02:47.016 --> 02:48.415
What kind of changes?

02:48.585 --> 02:51.952
Detective Moore became
gradually more anxious, unfocused.

02:52.121 --> 02:54.214
And then this morning...

02:58.995 --> 03:02.453
This morning I noticed some bruises
on the back of her neck and her arm...

03:02.632 --> 03:05.897
...and when I asked her about them,
she told me she had fallen.

03:06.870 --> 03:07.928
You didn't believe her?

03:08.404 --> 03:10.838
The bruises were inconsistent
with her explanation.

03:11.007 --> 03:16.035
And, no, I do not believe her,
and I am worried about her safety.

03:17.380 --> 03:19.780
All right, then, so I should talk to her.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.211
Before you do,
I'm trying to avoid creating problems.

03:23.386 --> 03:27.220
And if I'm overreacting to what I saw,
and if I'm wrong about this...

03:27.390 --> 03:31.986
But if you're right, this is an assault on one
of our employees, which cannot be ignored.

03:32.161 --> 03:34.823
And which Captain Raydor
should not investigate on her own.

03:35.265 --> 03:40.794
So I would like Major Crimes to discreetly
examine the life of Detective Moore...

03:40.970 --> 03:42.232
...and report back to me.

03:42.405 --> 03:46.705
I can't start a criminal investigation
unless she files a complaint of some kind.

03:46.876 --> 03:51.575
I was hoping, chief, that maybe you would
be able to see past the obstacles...

03:51.748 --> 03:53.511
...in this particular situation.

03:53.683 --> 03:56.743
The obstacles that you're talking about
are the justice system.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.821
And I can't create charges out of thin air.
I need evidence.

03:59.989 --> 04:04.756
Of course you do. But you can easily
do an oblique interview with that husband.

04:04.928 --> 04:07.590
I'm sorry,
who's in charge of this investigation?

04:07.764 --> 04:09.026
You are.

04:09.198 --> 04:13.464
Captain Raydor, I promise you that Chief
Johnson will pursue this inquiry vigorously.

04:13.636 --> 04:17.036
But let's leave to her the when and where
she will approach the husband.

04:17.206 --> 04:21.802
In the meantime,
we will tread very lightly here, is that clear?

04:22.478 --> 04:24.469
Of course.

04:24.647 --> 04:28.481
If we're going to do this by the book,
I should start by getting a statement...

04:28.651 --> 04:31.142
...from Detective Moore's
immediate superior officer.

04:31.654 --> 04:33.679
I figured you'd ask that,
so I prepared one.

04:35.725 --> 04:38.387
"At approximately 8:45 a.m.
this morning...

04:38.561 --> 04:43.328
...I observed Detective Ally Moore
in a sleeveless shirt. I spotted...

04:45.435 --> 04:47.995
- I spotted..."
-"Visible bruises on the back of her neck.

04:48.171 --> 04:50.833
And a second bruise
on the backside of her upper left arm.

04:51.007 --> 04:54.568
When asked about these injuries,
Moore insisted they were caused by a fall...

04:54.744 --> 04:58.544
...for which she needed no medical
attention. Signed, Captain Sharon Raydor."

04:58.715 --> 05:02.207
We are not to mention Detective Moore
by name outside of this office.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.751
Which means that we tread lightly.

05:04.921 --> 05:08.322
Treading lightly for one of Raydor's people.
Now, there's irony for you.

05:08.491 --> 05:11.892
Chief, I have the background information
for the husband, Shawn Moore.

05:12.061 --> 05:14.256
Six-four, 230 pounds,
construction supervisor.

05:14.430 --> 05:17.729
Collecting unemployment
for the past nine months, but no record.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.528
- You want me to bring him in?
- No.

05:21.037 --> 05:22.368
We're treading lightly.

05:23.139 --> 05:25.073
We could quietly
canvass the neighborhood...

05:25.241 --> 05:27.539
...see if anyone's seen or heard anything.

05:27.710 --> 05:30.508
- That's an excellent idea. Help yourself.
- Oh, thank you.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.376
Moore's personnel packet.
I put her in Interview 2.

05:33.549 --> 05:37.212
She's nervous as hell. I told her we had
an overlapping investigation with FID.

05:37.387 --> 05:38.877
Thank you, detective.

05:39.055 --> 05:42.616
- We'll see what she has to say.
- I think this is a complete waste of time.

05:42.792 --> 05:46.250
Moore did not report her husband to Raydor,
you think she's gonna talk to us?

05:46.429 --> 05:48.624
There's no point
in being reasonable about this.

05:48.798 --> 05:52.290
We've been ordered to look into it,
so that's exactly what we're gonna do.

05:53.970 --> 05:55.870
She needed a broom.

06:03.813 --> 06:05.644
Is that my personnel packet?

06:06.015 --> 06:07.676
Yes, detective.

06:07.850 --> 06:11.411
And I compliment you on the number
of excellent evaluations you've compiled.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.445
Captain Raydor
seems to hold you in high esteem.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.387
As I do her.

06:16.559 --> 06:19.027
I was just wondering
which one of my investigations...

06:19.195 --> 06:21.755
...would've bumped up against something
in Major Crimes.

06:23.299 --> 06:27.167
All right, then, let's be direct,
because I appreciate direct...

06:27.336 --> 06:31.864
...and I see here that you have completed
our domestic-violence seminar.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.833
Oh, my God.

06:35.845 --> 06:39.212
Detective,
first thing I wanna do is assure you...

06:39.382 --> 06:41.680
...that this interview
is entirely confidential.

06:41.851 --> 06:45.184
<i>- Nothing you say here will leave this room.
- Fine.</i>

06:45.354 --> 06:47.982
All right then,
so how are things at home?

06:50.560 --> 06:54.428
- Captain Raydor spoke to you?
- Again, detective, how are things at home?

06:56.132 --> 06:57.963
As I told her, things are fine.

06:58.734 --> 07:01.134
I don't know why
Captain Raydor would involve you.

07:01.304 --> 07:02.635
Really?

07:03.673 --> 07:07.541
Is this what you were wearing when
the captain first saw you this morning?

07:07.710 --> 07:10.975
No, I was changing downstairs.

07:11.581 --> 07:15.176
Would you please stand up,
remove your jacket and turn around?

07:18.387 --> 07:22.187
Since we're not interviewing a suspect,
I think we can zoom in and toggle down.

07:27.763 --> 07:29.856
Hm. That's not good.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.727
<i>Uh, may I see your neck, please?</i>

07:31.901 --> 07:33.835
Toggle up, Buzz.

07:35.905 --> 07:37.532
No, it's not.

07:38.107 --> 07:40.166
<i>Where did you get those bruises?</i>

07:40.343 --> 07:42.277
<i>As I told Captain Raydor, I fell.</i>

07:42.445 --> 07:43.878
<i>Onto someone's open hand?</i>

07:45.148 --> 07:48.709
I wonder what your husband would say
if I questioned him about those bruises.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.318
Leave my husband out of this.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.959
All right, then.
I can't force you to file a report.

07:59.128 --> 08:02.188
But it is important that you understand
that as your supervisors...

08:02.365 --> 08:05.266
...if we suspect domestic abuse
we are required to document it.

08:05.434 --> 08:08.528
- Fine, consider it documented.
- With pictures.

08:08.704 --> 08:10.831
- I'm sending you to the SID photo lab.
- No way.

08:11.007 --> 08:15.341
If you refuse to cooperate, I need
to document that too as insubordination.

08:15.511 --> 08:18.036
So you and Captain Raydor
see a few bruises...

08:18.214 --> 08:22.344
...and now your overreacting
becomes part of my permanent file?

08:22.518 --> 08:26.614
- Do you realize what you're doing?
- I'm just following rules.

08:26.789 --> 08:29.314
And it would help if you did the same.

08:50.546 --> 08:52.446
Not even a restraining order yet?

08:52.615 --> 08:57.746
She's probably afraid to file.
Big guy like that hitting her.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.820
Well, you did what you could.

09:01.891 --> 09:05.418
- That's it?
- Pope told me you asked for discretion.

09:05.595 --> 09:10.396
Yes, and he also asked
that this case be taken seriously.

09:10.566 --> 09:12.466
Yet, I can see there's no one else here.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.433
They're all out canvassing
Detective Moore's neighborhood...

09:15.605 --> 09:19.507
...looking for something I can follow up on.
- This is abuse, plain and simple.

09:19.675 --> 09:22.337
You didn't get an admission of abuse
from her either.

09:22.511 --> 09:25.446
And have you considered
what the husband's attorney might do...

09:25.615 --> 09:30.109
...if it turns out he's innocent?
Shoot, I could write those headlines.

09:30.286 --> 09:32.777
Well, you are worried about headlines,
commander...

09:32.955 --> 09:37.016
...and I'm worried about one of my
employees getting the crap beat out of her.

09:37.193 --> 09:40.822
Is there no way to talk to the husband?
That's what I'd do.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.262
You're not in charge. I don't have
what I need to confront Shawn Moore.

09:44.433 --> 09:46.867
You get people
to confess to murder all the time...

09:47.036 --> 09:49.436
...and you're telling me
that with these pictures...

09:49.605 --> 09:52.301
...you can't pick up the phone
and call Ally's husband...

09:52.475 --> 09:55.376
...and ask him
how she became so severely beaten?

09:55.544 --> 10:00.140
Captain, I care about this kind of violence
every bit as much as you do.

10:02.885 --> 10:04.512
Okay.

10:05.788 --> 10:07.813
I'll take your word for it.

10:08.958 --> 10:14.487
And I will expect
a more thorough report later. Thank you.

10:18.301 --> 10:19.893
"Thorough."

10:29.412 --> 10:31.209
Fritzi?

10:32.448 --> 10:34.040
Fritzi?

10:34.216 --> 10:37.549
No, no, no. Not on the table.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.417
Not on the table.
What are you doing up there, huh? Huh?

10:41.590 --> 10:43.922
What are you doing?

11:17.660 --> 11:21.824
- Chief, chief... We got Pope...
- Lieutenant!

11:23.399 --> 11:25.162
Chief Johnson, if you could.

11:25.968 --> 11:27.526
I'm sorry.

11:36.212 --> 11:39.841
- What was that all about?
- I take it your interview with Moore...

11:40.015 --> 11:43.473
...regarding her domestic-abuse situation,
didn't go well yesterday?

11:43.652 --> 11:44.949
Did Captain Raydor call you?

11:45.121 --> 11:47.521
No, I spoke with her in person
at the crime scene.

11:47.690 --> 11:49.487
What crime scene?

11:50.493 --> 11:52.859
At approximately 1 a.m. this morning...

11:53.028 --> 11:56.361
...a 911 call was put out
from Detective Moore's residence.

11:56.866 --> 11:59.630
When the responding officer arrived,
her husband, Shawn...

11:59.802 --> 12:05.206
...fired at him with her weapon.
The officer returned fire, killing him.

12:05.608 --> 12:07.633
So Ally isn't dead?

12:07.810 --> 12:11.302
But the husband is,
going on eight hours now.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.711
FID was sent to the scene
because it's an officer-involved shooting...

12:14.884 --> 12:16.977
...which Raydor believes
is a direct result...

12:17.153 --> 12:19.849
...of your not taking
Detective Moore's problem seriously.

12:20.022 --> 12:21.717
And I'm inclined to agree with her.

12:21.891 --> 12:23.984
Your failure to interview the husband...

12:24.160 --> 12:26.651
...endangered the lives
of two L.A.P.D. officers.

12:26.829 --> 12:30.822
Let me be clear about this.
Detective Moore would not file charges.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.992
And you insisted on discretion.
"Tread lightly."

12:34.170 --> 12:37.435
- Which is exactly how I proceeded.
- If this had been a murder...

12:37.606 --> 12:39.267
...you would've been here all night.

12:39.442 --> 12:42.878
In a murder case, I don't need
a criminal complaint, there's a dead body.

12:43.045 --> 12:46.947
Well, you got one of those now, you happy?
When the press gets word that we knew...

12:47.116 --> 12:51.348
...one of our officers was in danger,
and we did not move aggressively to fix it...

12:51.520 --> 12:53.044
And let me be clear.

12:53.222 --> 12:56.020
- You did not move aggressively.
- Look...

12:56.192 --> 12:59.218
Why didn't you interview the husband?
Answer that.

12:59.395 --> 13:04.025
It's because Captain Raydor suggested it,
and don't try to pretend otherwise.

13:08.070 --> 13:12.370
Maybe you just don't care anymore
about how this might affect the department.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.203
But understand this, I do care.

13:16.111 --> 13:20.047
You and your squad will go
to Detective Moore's house immediately.

13:20.216 --> 13:24.744
The domestic-abuse case will remain open
until you have proven to my satisfaction...

13:24.920 --> 13:28.651
...that we did everything possible
to avoid what happened last night.

14:04.193 --> 14:06.957
Buzz, how did you get here
so much faster than we did?

14:07.129 --> 14:08.687
My GPS is really good.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.193
- Why don't we get a GPS?
- It's called a map.

14:31.053 --> 14:33.351
Hello, officer.

14:40.396 --> 14:43.991
Excuse me, chief,
I have my hands full here already.

14:44.166 --> 14:49.126
And given the circumstances, I'm just not
sure what else there is for you to do.

14:49.305 --> 14:53.298
I've already heard it, captain,
from someone higher ranking than you.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.966
- I'll need a briefing.
- Your case is over.

14:56.145 --> 14:59.046
Not according to Chief Pope, so...

15:00.749 --> 15:02.910
After you, captain, after you.

15:06.889 --> 15:08.356
At 1:02 a.m. this morning...

15:08.524 --> 15:13.427
...a 911 call was placed from this residence
by Detective Ally Moore...

15:13.596 --> 15:17.191
...with whom, I do believe,
Major Crimes is slightly familiar.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.700
Ally managed to lock herself inside
the bathroom...

15:20.869 --> 15:23.099
...long enough to cry for help
to the operator.

15:23.272 --> 15:26.105
While the call went out,
her husband knocked down the door...

15:26.275 --> 15:27.867
...dragged her across the floor...

15:28.043 --> 15:31.035
...and at some point,
smashed her face against this door frame.

15:31.213 --> 15:35.741
Sergeant Ryan Dunn
was the first one on the scene at 1:05 a.m.

15:35.918 --> 15:38.751
- So he entered here?
- Yes, with weapon drawn.

15:38.921 --> 15:44.382
Shawn Moore, your suspect, was right here,
and he was in possession of his wife's gun.

15:44.994 --> 15:46.723
- Here?
- Right.

15:47.096 --> 15:50.122
- Mr. Moore fired at Sergeant Dunn.
- And missed.

15:50.299 --> 15:53.564
Sergeant Dunn returned fire,
hitting Mr. Moore twice.

15:53.736 --> 15:55.636
And your suspect collapsed right here.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.739
And where's Ally Moore right now?

15:59.908 --> 16:01.876
Ally is at UCLA Hospital...

16:02.044 --> 16:05.912
...receiving treatment for the concussion
she received during the attack.

16:06.081 --> 16:09.312
Or maybe, perhaps,
it was just another bad fall.

16:09.485 --> 16:11.976
I don't wanna second guess your case.

16:12.755 --> 16:15.315
Okay, I'm going to need to speak
to Sergeant Dunn.

16:15.758 --> 16:19.285
Sorry, regardless
of what Chief Pope might think...

16:19.461 --> 16:22.191
...Sergeant Dunn's OIS
falls under my jurisdiction...

16:22.364 --> 16:25.629
...and you're not going to talk to him
until I finish my report.

16:25.801 --> 16:27.234
Okay, let's make this easier.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.736
I order you to make Sergeant Dunn
available immediately...

16:30.906 --> 16:32.999
...to be interviewed
by a neutral third party.

16:33.175 --> 16:35.302
And who might that be?

16:35.477 --> 16:38.002
How you doing, sergeant?
Good to see you.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.609
<i>Sergeant Dunn
has already given his statement...</i>

16:40.783 --> 16:43.047
<i>...which couldn't have been
more straightforward.</i>

16:43.218 --> 16:44.845
<i>- Yeah, we know.
- So why are we here?</i>

16:45.020 --> 16:48.285
- Just a few questions regarding...
- What more do you people need?

16:48.457 --> 16:52.325
Sergeant Dunn has only had one other
officer-involved shooting his entire career.

16:52.494 --> 16:54.826
FID cleared him before, they'll do it again.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.356
Major Crimes has a case related...

16:57.533 --> 17:01.560
...to the suspect who was shot to death
last night, that's all.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.431
- What do you wanna know?
- First...

17:06.608 --> 17:09.372
...had you ever met Detective Moore
before last night?

17:10.045 --> 17:11.808
No. Well, not to my knowledge.

17:11.980 --> 17:16.713
So you were completely unaware
that the L.A.P.D. had mounted an inquiry...

17:16.885 --> 17:20.218
...as to whether Detective Moore
was a target of domestic abuse?

17:21.223 --> 17:24.886
Well, looks like whoever was conducting
that investigation dropped the ball.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.730
<i>Yeah, you know what, sergeant?</i>

17:30.699 --> 17:32.360
You don't know jack about that.

17:32.935 --> 17:36.063
So why don't you just stick
to your own actions, how about that?

17:40.042 --> 17:42.408
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

17:42.578 --> 17:47.413
- Now, you were first on the scene, correct?
- Yes, sir, when I heard the radio call.

17:47.583 --> 17:52.145
- How quickly were you able to respond?
- Less than three minutes, 1:05 a.m.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.414
I parked, I got out of the car.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.059
<i>I heard screaming inside the house...</i>

17:58.227 --> 18:01.287
<i>...I kicked in the front door,
I entered with my weapon drawn.</i>

18:01.463 --> 18:03.021
And what did you see?

18:03.198 --> 18:06.429
A white male, 30 to 40, 6'3" or more.

18:06.602 --> 18:09.196
Pointing a gun at a woman
on the floor at his feet.

18:09.371 --> 18:11.601
- Then what?
- I ordered the guy to drop the gun.

18:12.241 --> 18:14.903
<i>He turned and fired at me,
so I returned fire.</i>

18:15.077 --> 18:17.238
<i>He kept moving toward me, I fired again.</i>

18:17.412 --> 18:20.677
<i>He hit the floor,
I kicked the gun out of his hand.</i>

18:20.883 --> 18:22.544
<i>That's when I cleared the house.</i>

18:22.718 --> 18:26.950
<i>I saw the victim had a bloody gash
on her head, so I called paramedics.</i>

18:27.122 --> 18:28.919
And Detective Moore's state of mind?

18:29.091 --> 18:31.855
Well, she kept screaming at me
for shooting her husband.

18:32.261 --> 18:35.822
Screaming at you
for shooting her husband.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.423
Tell me...

18:37.599 --> 18:43.560
...sergeant, did Detective Moore mention
how her husband happened to get her gun?

18:46.475 --> 18:47.737
What do you mean?

18:47.910 --> 18:52.313
Well, I'm just wondering,
if she was so afraid of her husband, why...?

18:52.481 --> 18:54.381
Why would you keep a gun
in your house?

18:57.419 --> 19:01.287
- To protect herself.
- Wait, did Detective Moore say that?

19:01.924 --> 19:03.414
Well, yeah.

19:03.592 --> 19:07.494
She said her husband had been abusing her,
that's why she kept her gun in the house.

19:09.331 --> 19:14.291
And before I could ask any more questions,
backup arrived, the paramedics came, and...

19:14.469 --> 19:18.963
- At, let's see, 1:07 a.m.
- Yes, sir.

19:19.141 --> 19:20.733
<i>Thank you, sergeant.</i>

19:20.909 --> 19:22.308
<i>Thank you, Mr. Monroe.</i>

19:22.477 --> 19:25.537
Well, I think that we can all agree...

19:25.714 --> 19:31.675
...that as it regards your domestic-abuse
investigation, this interview is damaging.

19:32.821 --> 19:35.312
Yes, captain, it certainly is.

19:35.490 --> 19:36.980
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:44.833 --> 19:47.961
First off, Sergeant Dunn rattled off
about 500 things that he did...

19:48.136 --> 19:52.038
...during two minutes at the crime scene
before backup arrived.

19:52.908 --> 19:56.400
Where's the box with the chicken-and-beef
and-pork-and-shrimp thing I like?

19:56.578 --> 19:58.478
What's it called again?

19:58.647 --> 19:59.807
The Happy Family.

19:59.982 --> 20:02.974
- Mm.
- It's right here.

20:03.752 --> 20:05.413
Thank you.

20:05.587 --> 20:07.384
Hot mustard?

20:07.956 --> 20:10.390
- They forgot it again.
- Oh!

20:13.996 --> 20:18.365
When I spoke to Detective Moore yesterday,
I did everything but stand on my head...

20:18.533 --> 20:21.627
...to convince her to file a report,
but she wouldn't do it.

20:21.803 --> 20:25.239
And then Will starts yelling at me
for ignoring the husband.

20:25.407 --> 20:26.704
I didn't ignore the husband.

20:26.875 --> 20:30.504
- You would never ignore the husband.
- Exactly. It's completely unfair.

20:32.514 --> 20:33.981
Don't you think it's unfair?

20:35.150 --> 20:38.813
Yeah, it's really unfair.
So why don't you quit?

20:39.988 --> 20:41.148
Quit what?

20:41.323 --> 20:42.756
Your job, if it's so horrible.

20:42.925 --> 20:47.521
- Oh, come on, I can't quit.
- Then please stop complaining about it.

20:48.130 --> 20:50.564
Maybe you don't realize
but since you've come home...

20:50.732 --> 20:53.963
...you've only talked about you,
your job and the food.

20:54.136 --> 20:58.664
My murder, my victim, the mustard.
How about asking how my day went?

20:59.174 --> 21:03.110
You know, "Hey, Fritz,
how's your little job at the FBI?"

21:03.478 --> 21:07.107
Hey, wait a minute, that's not fair.
I never make light of your job.

21:07.282 --> 21:12.219
I was just about to ask you
how your day was, honey.

21:12.387 --> 21:14.855
Don't... Don't be mad.

21:15.857 --> 21:18.291
- You wanna know how my day was?
- Yes, I do.

21:19.227 --> 21:21.161
It was extremely frustrating.

21:21.330 --> 21:23.560
And now I'm exhausted,
so I'm going to bed.

21:23.732 --> 21:26.292
You can finish off the Happy Family
by yourself.

21:26.468 --> 21:31.201
And could you please just
put everything away when you're finished.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.738
Of course I'll do that.

21:39.114 --> 21:41.674
You're awfully touchy lately.

21:42.017 --> 21:44.383
What was that all about?

21:46.755 --> 21:48.279
In two days of canvassing...

21:48.457 --> 21:51.585
...no one has ever heard anything
in Detective Moore's neighborhood.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.991
No yelling, no arguing, no gunshots.
So I'm thinking they must have...

21:55.163 --> 21:57.688
...a mind-your-own-business clause
in their mortgages.

21:57.866 --> 22:00.767
Lieutenant Flynn,
were you able to time Dunn's actions?

22:01.036 --> 22:02.901
I did a walk-through of the crime scene.

22:03.071 --> 22:06.063
Including the conversation Dunn had
with Moore outside the house.

22:06.241 --> 22:09.335
He would have had to have been there
like, four minutes by himself.

22:09.511 --> 22:12.776
- But backup showed up in two.
- Another little complication.

22:12.948 --> 22:15.940
Prelim from the morgue says
the two shots fired at Shawn Moore...

22:16.118 --> 22:18.518
...one hit him in the spine,
the other in the brain.

22:18.687 --> 22:21.212
He couldn't have been advancing
when Dunn fired at him.

22:21.390 --> 22:24.086
He was either instantly paralyzed
or instantly dead.

22:25.227 --> 22:29.459
Chief, Detective Moore's waiting for you
in Interview 2, and Captain Raydor's here.

22:30.298 --> 22:31.731
Thank you, Buzz.

22:31.900 --> 22:35.199
Oh! That woman.

22:37.539 --> 22:41.373
I see you have Ally Moore waiting
in an interview room.

22:41.543 --> 22:44.478
Yes, I'm still trying to finish up
with my domestic-abuse case.

22:44.646 --> 22:46.307
Hate to be the bearer of bad news...

22:46.481 --> 22:50.349
...but you're not gonna be making an arrest
in that case. Your suspect is dead.

22:50.519 --> 22:53.249
If anyone's gonna interview Ally Moore,
it's gonna be me.

22:53.422 --> 22:56.619
I certainly understand the desire
to wanna protect one of your own.

22:56.792 --> 23:00.228
Well, somebody has to do it
because you certainly didn't, chief.

23:00.862 --> 23:04.958
We're in the middle of an officer-involved
shooting. Ally Moore is a percipient witness.

23:05.133 --> 23:10.093
You know what, captain, Major Crimes has
a domestic-abuse case that's also still open.

23:10.272 --> 23:13.708
That is, until Chief Pope says otherwise.

23:13.875 --> 23:18.812
So if you really wanna lessen
the burden on Detective Moore...

23:18.980 --> 23:22.313
...you two should question her together.

23:26.888 --> 23:30.517
Okay. You know what, that's fine.

23:31.460 --> 23:33.428
Excuse us, commander.

23:34.963 --> 23:36.294
After you.

23:39.534 --> 23:40.831
Oh, God.

23:43.738 --> 23:45.831
This is so horrible. I am so sorry.

23:46.007 --> 23:49.602
You do not need to apologize, detective.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.370
I have to.

23:52.547 --> 23:57.041
Because of my refusal to cooperate,
an officer was forced to put his life at risk...

23:57.786 --> 23:59.014
...and my husband is dead.

23:59.387 --> 24:01.719
Well, you're not the only one
responsible for that.

24:04.226 --> 24:07.218
I shouldn't have tried
to handle it by myself.

24:07.395 --> 24:08.419
Handle what yourself?

24:08.597 --> 24:10.531
When you sent me
to get my photographs...

24:10.699 --> 24:13.930
...I knew it wouldn't be long
before somebody was gonna talk to Shawn.

24:14.102 --> 24:17.503
So when I got home that night,
I told him that he'd gone too far...

24:17.672 --> 24:21.108
...and that he couldn't hit me anymore
because I couldn't hide it anymore.

24:21.276 --> 24:23.574
And he got mad at me.

24:23.945 --> 24:27.005
- And that's when he attacked you?
- Yes.

24:27.182 --> 24:29.047
And you locked yourself in the bathroom?

24:30.519 --> 24:32.248
- Yes.
- And dialed 911...

24:32.420 --> 24:35.412
Captain, why don't we let Detective Moore
tell the story?

24:35.590 --> 24:37.922
I'm sorry, please continue.

24:39.394 --> 24:42.761
I told the operator
that my husband was trying to kill me...

24:43.765 --> 24:48.498
...and to send help.
I think I was screaming.

24:48.670 --> 24:50.604
<i>Shawn knocked down the bathroom door.</i>

24:50.772 --> 24:53.673
<i>And then he dragged me
into the living room, mostly by my hair.</i>

24:53.842 --> 24:57.437
<i>And then he smashed my face
into something, I don't even know what.</i>

24:57.979 --> 25:02.006
And I couldn't see for a moment,
and my face went hot.

25:02.350 --> 25:06.616
And then I saw he had my gun
in his hands.

25:06.788 --> 25:11.020
<i>And then there was yelling,
and then Shawn moved away from me.</i>

25:12.093 --> 25:13.924
Then I heard gunshots.

25:14.095 --> 25:15.756
Well, let me ask you this.

25:15.931 --> 25:19.128
How exactly did your husband
gain possession of your weapon?

25:22.170 --> 25:23.296
Well, what do you mean?

25:23.471 --> 25:28.306
Your husband fired at Sergeant Dunn
using your gun. How did he get it?

25:29.277 --> 25:30.539
Oh. Um...

25:30.712 --> 25:33.442
- Well, he knew where I kept it.
- Which was where exactly?

25:34.516 --> 25:35.540
In my vehicle.

25:36.117 --> 25:40.577
So I didn't think that Shawn could get
to my gun if it was out of the house.

25:40.755 --> 25:43.553
But maybe he got my keys
when I was in the bathroom.

25:44.793 --> 25:45.987
Yeah.

25:46.728 --> 25:48.889
Will you apologize
to Sergeant Dunn for me?

25:49.064 --> 25:52.397
I think that I yelled at him
when he tried to saved me.

25:52.567 --> 25:54.592
And I'm sorry for that.

26:02.277 --> 26:07.442
Chief Johnson, I have some concerns
about Sergeant Dunn's original statement.

26:07.616 --> 26:10.084
Why, captain?
Because of everything he accomplished...

26:10.252 --> 26:12.982
...in the very short amount of time
before backup arrived?

26:13.154 --> 26:16.021
Or is it the contradictory physical evidence
from the morgue?

26:16.191 --> 26:18.819
Or could it be the placement
of Detective Moore's gun?

26:18.994 --> 26:22.293
Well, I am curious also
why Moore and Dunn's statement...

26:22.464 --> 26:24.932
...regarding her weapon
are so drastically different.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.227
It's one question
they didn't expect us to ask.

26:27.402 --> 26:29.836
You believe they knew each other
prior this incident?

26:30.005 --> 26:32.132
Oh, yes, captain, I do.

26:36.244 --> 26:39.839
What proof do you have that Sergeant Dunn
and Detective Moore knew each other?

26:40.015 --> 26:41.880
They denied it.

26:42.050 --> 26:45.645
Okay, let's talk about what I mean by
"proof." Because when I use that word...

26:45.820 --> 26:49.916
...I mean some physical evidence that
we could all look at, you know, and go:

26:50.091 --> 26:53.822
Fine, how about this?
FID's photos from the crime scene.

26:53.995 --> 26:57.260
Look, Sergeant Dunn parked his patrol car
right in front of the house.

26:58.333 --> 27:01.791
- To which he had been dispatched.
- It was dark, addresses are hard to see.

27:01.970 --> 27:04.666
You never park a patrol car
directly in front of the house.

27:04.839 --> 27:06.568
Okay, when I say physical evidence...

27:06.741 --> 27:10.507
...I mean, you know, fingerprints, DNA,
or how about phone records?

27:11.446 --> 27:12.777
E-mails, then?

27:13.214 --> 27:16.240
No e-mails?
Did anyone ever actually see them togeth...?

27:16.418 --> 27:19.785
You know what, why don't I just stop
guessing and just tell me exactly...

27:19.954 --> 27:22.616
...how you've concluded that Dunn
and Moore had a relationship.

27:23.992 --> 27:25.687
Come in.

27:26.795 --> 27:27.853
What is that, captain?

27:28.963 --> 27:33.059
Sergeant Dunn's officer-involved-shooting
report from three years ago.

27:33.535 --> 27:36.231
- That's one OIS report?
- It is.

27:37.205 --> 27:38.729
And along with Sergeant Elliot...

27:38.907 --> 27:41.808
...there was a second
relatively new FID detective...

27:41.976 --> 27:45.639
...who assisted him in the investigation
of Sergeant Dunn's case.

27:47.716 --> 27:49.707
Detective Ally Moore.

27:52.620 --> 27:54.281
So Dunn and Moore had met.

27:54.456 --> 27:57.220
Oh, I'd bet they were more
than just friends.

27:59.961 --> 28:01.428
All right, what's the next step?

28:03.398 --> 28:06.265
These are the bullets fired from Dunn's gun
three years ago...

28:06.434 --> 28:08.368
...during his officer-involved shooting.

28:08.536 --> 28:14.805
And these are the bullets that were fired
into Shawn Moore's body two nights ago.

28:15.343 --> 28:19.746
- The bullets don't match up.
- They do not. But wait...

28:20.048 --> 28:21.845
...there's more.
- God.

28:22.684 --> 28:26.848
This is the bullet that was fired
at Sergeant Dunn by Shawn Moore...

28:27.021 --> 28:28.283
...the night before last.

28:30.792 --> 28:34.091
Are you telling us,
in as long a way as possible of course...

28:34.262 --> 28:39.928
...that the bullet fired at Sergeant Dunn
came from his own gun?

28:40.502 --> 28:42.094
Yes.

28:43.238 --> 28:47.641
Okay, so wait a minute, Dunn's gun...

28:48.710 --> 28:49.734
I'm confused.

28:49.911 --> 28:53.176
Lieutenant Tao is trying to say
that during the rescue of Ally Moore...

28:53.348 --> 28:57.216
...the bullets fired from Dunn's gun
were not fired from Dunn's gun.

28:57.685 --> 28:58.709
Exactly.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.055
Okay, where are the ballistics
from Detective Moore's weapon?

29:02.223 --> 29:03.850
Not back yet.

29:04.025 --> 29:05.492
But it's being rushed.

29:05.660 --> 29:09.187
Well, not fast enough, lieutenant,
because I don't have it.

29:09.364 --> 29:10.490
Now...

29:13.535 --> 29:14.797
Uh...

29:14.969 --> 29:18.996
All right, I need to know exactly where Dunn
and Moore are at this very moment, please.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.233
Thank you so much.

29:23.111 --> 29:26.979
Are you going to all this trouble to show
there was a motive for the domestic abuse?

29:27.148 --> 29:29.412
First you yell at me
for not moving aggressively.

29:29.584 --> 29:32.951
And now you're questioning me
for moving too aggressively.

29:33.121 --> 29:34.918
Okay, I'm not gonna second-guess you.

29:35.089 --> 29:38.081
- Thank you.
- But this, I think, you're gonna miss.

29:38.993 --> 29:43.054
- Miss what?
- This team you've created. These people.

29:43.231 --> 29:46.928
From the way you were handling this case,
I thought you had checked out already.

29:47.101 --> 29:49.228
Will, what on earth are you talking about?

29:50.972 --> 29:53.668
You're moving back to D.C., right?

29:54.175 --> 29:55.904
Look, I know about Fritz's promotion.

29:59.147 --> 30:00.171
Come with me.

30:01.983 --> 30:03.007
What promotion?

30:04.486 --> 30:06.044
Oh. Uh...

30:06.221 --> 30:09.622
Maybe I'm wrong.
Yeah, you know what, I think I'm wrong.

30:09.791 --> 30:11.554
Wrong about what?

30:12.594 --> 30:14.084
Okay, somebody at DOJ told me...

30:14.262 --> 30:18.096
...Fritz had been offered command of
the FBI's Critical Incident Response Team.

30:18.266 --> 30:20.734
I know nothing about this. Nothing.

30:21.469 --> 30:23.061
Why didn't you say something?

30:23.238 --> 30:27.299
I didn't think there was anything I could do,
and I was pissed off you hadn't told me.

30:27.475 --> 30:30.774
- Oh, I cannot believe this.
- Wait a minute, hold on. You're not going?

30:30.945 --> 30:35.746
Look, even if I was thinking about leaving,
don't you think I'd come to you first?

30:37.986 --> 30:39.544
Why?

30:39.721 --> 30:42.690
Why would Fritz not mention this to me?

30:42.924 --> 30:45.085
Maybe because
he didn't want you to know.

30:45.260 --> 30:49.162
And that's what you do
when you wanna keep a secret, you hide it.

30:49.330 --> 30:51.855
You know,
even in the best of relationships...

30:52.033 --> 30:55.127
...sometimes there's stuff
that people wanna keep to themselves.

30:55.303 --> 30:58.363
He didn't want me to know,
so he kept it hidden.

30:59.474 --> 31:03.240
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

31:07.148 --> 31:08.638
Lieutenant Provenza.

31:08.816 --> 31:11.307
I got Dunn on one line,
Moore on the other.

31:11.486 --> 31:15.820
- Have them meet me at the morgue, please.
- What are you gonna do at the morgue?

31:16.691 --> 31:18.989
What I should have done yesterday.

31:19.794 --> 31:23.093
- Which is?
- Find out what Shawn Moore has to tell me.

31:31.172 --> 31:34.608
- Yes, that's him. That's Shawn.
- Thank you so much, Detective Moore.

31:35.009 --> 31:38.706
Again, I apologize for your having to come
down here to make the identification.

31:39.180 --> 31:40.670
The paperwork was misplaced.

31:41.816 --> 31:45.946
- Chief, Sergeant Dunn.
- Thank you so much, lieutenant.

31:51.893 --> 31:56.853
- I believe the two of you have already met.
- Yeah. Good to see you, detective.

31:57.398 --> 31:59.525
You seem calmer
than you did the other day.

31:59.701 --> 32:01.635
Yes, I'm better. Thank you.

32:03.504 --> 32:04.664
What's going on here?

32:04.839 --> 32:09.105
Oh, I'm just finishing up my investigation
into your officer-involved shooting.

32:09.277 --> 32:12.906
- This is your second in three years, correct?
- That's right.

32:13.081 --> 32:16.016
And if I'm not mistaken,
Detective Moore was involved in both?

32:21.089 --> 32:24.547
There's no need to deny it, detective.
It's well documented.

32:24.726 --> 32:27.058
You two obviously know each other.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.792
You've even been to Moore's house,
Sergeant Dunn.

32:29.964 --> 32:33.661
I know that because of where you parked
on the night of your so-called action.

32:33.835 --> 32:38.067
And that indicates not only do the two
of you know each other professionally...

32:38.239 --> 32:41.003
...but you're on something like
intimate terms.

32:41.743 --> 32:43.938
Ryan, don't say anything.

32:45.647 --> 32:48.946
That's all right. Your husband
can tell us everything we need to know.

32:49.117 --> 32:52.553
For example, the way he was shot.

32:53.054 --> 32:57.252
One of the rounds hit here,
in the outside right pectoral.

32:57.425 --> 32:59.791
Did some heavy-duty damage too.

33:00.728 --> 33:07.065
There's also a slightly upward trajectory
to this entrance wound.

33:07.235 --> 33:10.432
So readjusting the musculature...

33:12.240 --> 33:14.970
...until both the entry
and internal wounds are aligned...

33:15.143 --> 33:19.204
...we can see that when he was shot...
- Shawn's arms were raised.

33:19.614 --> 33:22.378
So he couldn't have been aiming a gun
at anyone.

33:24.285 --> 33:28.278
Which makes your statement, sergeant,
complete bullshit.

33:28.456 --> 33:31.254
Speaking of which,
the bullets we pulled from Shawn's body...

33:31.426 --> 33:34.486
...don't match those
from your shooting three years ago.

33:35.930 --> 33:39.661
And so I asked myself,
how could that possibly be?

33:40.201 --> 33:43.967
And then we decided
to test Detective Moore's weapon...

33:44.138 --> 33:46.402
...and the results
were absolutely fascinating.

33:46.574 --> 33:50.169
Because, although the barrel of your gun
doesn't match...

33:50.344 --> 33:53.939
...your previous officer-involved shooting,
the barrel of her gun does.

33:54.115 --> 33:58.108
So if you arrived at Detective Moore's house
and knocked down the door...

33:58.286 --> 34:01.346
<i>...and Shawn Moore was already dead,
all you had to do was...</i>

34:02.657 --> 34:05.182
...fire your weapon at the wall...

34:12.132 --> 34:14.465
...and then switch barrels with Ally...

34:16.603 --> 34:20.130
...and your big fat lie would have
been confirmed by the physical evidence.

34:20.908 --> 34:25.504
Ballistics would have shown that Dunn here
killed your husband instead of you.

34:26.147 --> 34:30.174
The only question as far as I'm concerned,
detective, is this:

34:30.351 --> 34:33.149
Did Sergeant Dunn plan on helping you
murder your husband?

34:33.321 --> 34:37.724
Or is this something that you convinced him
to cover up when he arrived on the scene?

34:37.891 --> 34:41.828
What? It wasn't murder.
It was self-defense, look at her face.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.725
Ryan, trust me, be quiet.

34:44.132 --> 34:48.295
Yes, Ryan, be quiet and look at her.
Particularly her arm.

34:48.469 --> 34:50.061
Officers.

34:50.237 --> 34:51.670
- What? No.
- Hey.

34:51.839 --> 34:54.239
- Doctor, would you please?
- Let me go. Let me go.

34:55.476 --> 34:57.501
- Wha...?
- What the hell are you doing?

34:57.678 --> 35:01.170
Proving that the hand that did this
was not your husband's hand.

35:01.582 --> 35:03.914
Look at the outline of the fingers
on Ally's arm.

35:04.085 --> 35:06.417
See how small they are
compared to her husband?

35:09.590 --> 35:12.718
Shawn Moore did not cause these injuries.
Ally did this to herself.

35:13.494 --> 35:15.257
I have to compliment you, detective.

35:15.429 --> 35:18.762
You played the role
of the abused wife perfectly.

35:19.400 --> 35:23.598
You behaved like a textbook victim,
except for one thing...

35:24.038 --> 35:26.199
...you didn't hide your injuries very well.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.638
Because the plan you made
to kill your husband...

35:28.810 --> 35:33.577
...depended on me seeing
how badly injured you appeared to be.

35:35.683 --> 35:37.514
Why would she do all that?

35:38.519 --> 35:41.955
To gain your sympathy. And your gun.

35:45.426 --> 35:47.018
Which brings back to my question.

35:47.195 --> 35:51.757
Sergeant Dunn, did you conspire
with Ally Moore to kill her husband?

35:51.933 --> 35:53.730
Did you?

36:05.947 --> 36:08.211
You don't wanna go anywhere, son.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.651
So far, you've only lost your job.

36:13.221 --> 36:15.416
Your freedom's still up for grabs.

36:15.823 --> 36:17.814
- I didn't plan anyone's murder.
- Wait, wait.

36:17.992 --> 36:21.826
Before you say anything, sergeant,
first you need to waive your rights.

36:21.996 --> 36:24.191
- Oh, God.
- Listen to me, sergeant.

36:24.365 --> 36:26.925
I wanna believe that
you were manipulated by Ally Moore.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.035
I was and so was Captain Raydor.

36:29.203 --> 36:32.695
But I need to know how much of what
happened to Shawn Moore was planned...

36:32.874 --> 36:34.808
...and what you thought of on the spot.

36:34.976 --> 36:37.410
If you knew in advance
that she was going to murder...

36:37.578 --> 36:40.012
No, hold on, just...

36:42.683 --> 36:47.052
Okay, I waive my rights. Look,
when you guys began your investigation...

36:47.221 --> 36:50.019
...Ally told me she couldn't risk
another beating from Shawn.

36:50.191 --> 36:54.093
- But he wasn't beating her.
- I didn't know that. I thought he was.

36:54.262 --> 36:57.095
And she begged me
to stay close to the house that night.

36:57.265 --> 36:59.995
Knowing you'd be the first to respond
to the 911 call.

37:00.167 --> 37:03.034
But did you know that
she was gonna kill her husband?

37:06.107 --> 37:07.199
Stage the crime scene?

37:09.877 --> 37:12.710
Smash her own head
up against the door frame?

37:16.550 --> 37:21.283
Listen, the only thing I told her
was to protect herself.

37:22.189 --> 37:24.054
I never said, "Shoot your husband."

37:25.026 --> 37:29.156
When I went to the house,
Shawn was dead, Ally was bleeding.

37:29.330 --> 37:32.663
I thought, after all she'd been through,
I should say I killed the guy.

37:33.100 --> 37:34.624
The only way to make that work...

37:34.802 --> 37:38.795
...was to fire off a round into the wall and
then switch the barrels of the two guns.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.078
Oh.

37:46.647 --> 37:48.672
Maybe she suggested it.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.579
Oh, God.

37:56.757 --> 38:01.217
Look, the only reason I did it
was because of what happened to her face.

38:02.830 --> 38:04.923
I mean,
why would she do that to herself?

38:05.099 --> 38:08.125
Because she's a little sociopath.

38:09.070 --> 38:11.834
And I hope for your sake
that she confirms your story.

38:26.721 --> 38:30.282
You are not gonna believe
why Ally Moore wanted to kill her husband.

38:30.825 --> 38:34.261
You mean there's a better reason
than the affair she was having with Dunn?

38:34.428 --> 38:37.022
Well, that depends
on how you feel about real estate.

38:37.198 --> 38:42.795
Ally and Shawn Moore had an interest-only
loan on their house that was about to reset.

38:42.970 --> 38:45.871
And they were going to lose their home,
unless...

38:46.040 --> 38:50.636
Unless one of them died
and the mortgage insurance kicked in.

38:51.145 --> 38:54.706
Well, it is awfully hard
to refinance these days.

38:56.050 --> 38:58.610
I would also like to say
that I am fully aware...

38:58.786 --> 39:02.278
...that at the beginning of investigation,
I was a total bitch.

39:03.524 --> 39:05.549
I'd say it was more in the middle.

39:06.894 --> 39:08.225
And near the end.

39:08.396 --> 39:11.297
I still believe that if you had talked
to the husband earlier...

39:11.465 --> 39:14.992
He might still be alive.
Yes, I've thought about that.

39:16.037 --> 39:19.063
And about how I might have resisted
talking to him because...

39:19.240 --> 39:20.468
Because I suggested it.

39:21.275 --> 39:22.401
It's possible.

39:23.844 --> 39:30.682
But I did wanna say that I do think that it
might be beneficial for the L.A.P.D. if we...

39:30.851 --> 39:34.617
- If you'd just do what I say.
...were to work a bit better together.

39:40.294 --> 39:42.194
The thing is...

39:43.397 --> 39:44.830
We just don't like each other.

39:44.999 --> 39:47.331
- No, we don't. Oh, my goodness, no.
- No, we don't.

39:47.501 --> 39:50.265
And you know,
that is a very difficult dynamic to change.

39:50.438 --> 39:52.099
- It is.
- It's very hard on everyone.

39:53.340 --> 39:57.140
- Okay. Well, good. Okay.
- Thank you so much for the final report.

39:57.311 --> 39:58.938
Thank you.

40:00.114 --> 40:02.446
- Have a good night, chief.
- Good night to you.

40:14.061 --> 40:15.756
Hi.

40:16.130 --> 40:17.722
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

40:17.898 --> 40:21.664
You were taking a long time to get home,
I was looking for something to snack on.

40:21.836 --> 40:24.964
Everything in here is spoiled.
Is that from the Cuban chicken place?

40:25.139 --> 40:30.133
Yeah, there was a line
so it took longer than I thought it would.

40:34.615 --> 40:39.314
Why didn't you tell me
about the promotion you were offered?

40:43.390 --> 40:45.415
Why didn't I tell you?

40:48.629 --> 40:50.995
You wanna move back to D. C?

40:52.833 --> 40:54.164
That's what I thought.

40:56.337 --> 40:59.602
Plus, we'd have to give up
two-thirds of our income.

41:00.074 --> 41:03.840
Plus, you'd have to find another job. Plus...
Plus, plus, plus.

41:05.012 --> 41:08.812
So is my job holding you back?

41:13.787 --> 41:16.017
I didn't use to think so.

41:16.457 --> 41:19.187
I honestly thought going into rehab...

41:19.360 --> 41:23.421
...meant I would never even be considered
for a promotion again.

41:24.765 --> 41:26.756
But I was wrong.

41:26.934 --> 41:32.634
And they may come to me, eventually,
with something I really wanna do.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.808
That would mean
we'd have to sit down...

41:36.677 --> 41:41.637
...and, you know,
seriously discuss the idea of moving.

41:42.349 --> 41:46.547
Which is the second best reason
I've heard today for not buying a house.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.312
Hey.

41:49.323 --> 41:52.656
Maybe I've been irritable about
just the idea of asking you to choose...

41:52.826 --> 41:55.659
...between me and your career...

41:57.798 --> 42:00.164
...because I didn't know
which one you'd pick.

42:30.297 --> 42:33.528
You wanna see me choose
between you and my career?
