00:45.100 --> 00:48.400
Man, this little piece of wood
ain't gonna hold no twister!

00:48.400 --> 00:51.600
We need to dig a hole,
you know what I'm saying?

00:51.600 --> 00:55.400
A big hole. The man ought
to be givin' us shovels.

00:55.400 --> 01:00.000
This whole damn place is going
to blow away. Why even bother?

01:01.600 --> 01:05.600
- Yo, boy, back me up, here!
- Shut up and hold it still.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.600
I know you ain't talkin' to me!

01:11.400 --> 01:13.100
You a big man, huh?

01:13.100 --> 01:19.800
Is that right? Charley potatoes.
Big-ass criminal. You a bad man?

01:20.400 --> 01:25.600
You a bitch, that's all you are.
You ain't got no money.

01:25.600 --> 01:29.000
You ain't got nothing.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.600
I'll hold it still.

01:35.100 --> 01:37.300
Is that still enough for ya?!

01:37.300 --> 01:38.900
Huh?!

01:44.900 --> 01:47.700
Put down the hammer, Rawls!

01:47.900 --> 01:49.600
Rawls!

01:55.000 --> 01:59.100
- Messed up old Whaley, did he?
- Messed him up good.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.600
Now what'd you go and do that for?

02:01.600 --> 02:06.200
- Man pissed me off, Boss.
- Who the hell doesn't? Box him.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.300
You can't put me in that box, Boss.
The... the storm's coming.

02:10.300 --> 02:13.200
Should have thought of that before
you messed up old Whaley.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.800
Well, to hell with Whaley.
You can't put me in that box!

02:15.800 --> 02:20.300
Boss! You can't put me in there!
You can't put me in that box!

02:20.300 --> 02:22.100
You can't do it!

02:22.100 --> 02:24.500
You're going to kill me, Boss!
Boss!

02:24.500 --> 02:26.900
You know they're saying tornado
touchdowns all over the county.

02:26.900 --> 02:31.000
I can't be responsible for Acts of God.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.200
Sorry, Rawls.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.700
Let me out! Let me out!!

02:45.000 --> 02:47.100
Let me out!

02:47.100 --> 02:50.700
Heeeelp!! Somebody!!

02:50.700 --> 02:53.600
Somebody help me, please!

03:09.600 --> 03:11.900
Oh, hell.

03:15.900 --> 03:17.900
Hello, sir?

03:37.600 --> 03:40.100
Oh, my God...

04:42.700 --> 04:46.700
HINDS COUNTY MORGUE
JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI

04:59.400 --> 05:01.400
Should we arrest David Copperfield?

05:01.400 --> 05:04.700
Yes, we should... but not for this.

05:04.700 --> 05:10.200
Now this is, uh, Raybert Fellowes superintendent of
Road Farm Six, Mississippi Department of Corrections.

05:10.200 --> 05:14.800
One of his guards found him in his office.
Not a drop of blood in the place.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.900
- Well, maybe he was killed elsewhere.
- No, I don't think so.

05:17.900 --> 05:22.000
Whoever did it took 40 minutes to do it
in the middle of a tornado.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.400
What do you make of that?

05:24.700 --> 05:29.700
I don't know. It's, uh... it's
not a simple bisection.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.200
There's a considerable amount
of his abdomen missing.

05:32.200 --> 05:35.800
I mean, it almost looks like a
burning but it's too localized.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.700
Maybe an industrial acid.

05:38.900 --> 05:44.200
There's, um... no acid found in his office.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.500
Spontaneous human combustion.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.600
- Scully...!
- Well, isn't that where you're going with this?

05:53.600 --> 05:59.000
Dear Diary: Today my heart leapt when Agent Scully
suggested spontaneous human combustion.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.300
Mulder, there are one or two
somewhat well-documented cases.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.600
Mulder, shut up.

06:08.200 --> 06:13.400
- Okay. What do you make of this?
- I don't have a theory.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.300
But I know of someone who does.

06:15.300 --> 06:18.300
Hell, yes, Pinker Rawls who did it.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.500
Though you got me as to how.

06:20.500 --> 06:24.100
- And who is Pinker Rawls?
- An inmate.
- Mean son of a bitch.

06:24.100 --> 06:29.700
Rawls was the prisoner who supposedly died in the tornado
that preceded superintendent Fellowes's murder.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.400
So you're saying that a ghost did this?

06:32.400 --> 06:35.100
I'm not putting the word to it.
That's up to y'all.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.500
All I know is that Rawls
hated the Captain.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.500
Captain locked him in the box when the storm hit
and Rawls didn't want to be locked in the box...

06:41.500 --> 06:47.900
...and when we found the box biggest piece was
about yay big... three miles from here.

06:47.900 --> 06:51.700
Now, this whole place was locked
and boarded up tight.

06:51.700 --> 06:55.100
No man got in here.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.400
That's all I'm saying.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.600
So we're looking for a dead man?

07:02.600 --> 07:03.900
I disagree.

07:03.900 --> 07:08.800
I think this Pinker Rawls is still very much alive.
You know, they never found his body.

07:08.800 --> 07:13.900
Okay. Well, at the risk of further ridicule,
Mulder, what if this wasn't a murder?

07:13.900 --> 07:18.700
I mean as I understand it, current theory
on spontaneous human combustion...

07:18.700 --> 07:25.700
...is that climatic conditions play a large part.
So, possibly a tornado may fit the bill.

07:25.700 --> 07:30.700
We've got lightning, um, static
electricity at a high potential.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.600
I can't argue with that.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.000
But I do think it's murder.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.900
Well, then how did Rawls
or whoever do this?

07:39.700 --> 07:46.500
How did he get in and out of a locked office and
prop a body up against the inside of a door?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.700
Termites?

08:12.300 --> 08:15.200
This is all he had in his bunk area.

08:16.900 --> 08:19.600
Wilson Pinker Rawls, age 34.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.700
Eight years into 30 for robbing a
wire office in Bay Saint Louis.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.800
The $90,000 he stole was never recovered.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.200
Well, it's not in here.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.100
Hey. Look at this.

08:36.200 --> 08:42.299
His record dates to 1978. Mostly small-time.
History of violence throughout.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.000
I wonder who she is.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.600
Thanks, Cutie.

08:59.600 --> 09:04.400
- Hey, you broke out the good stuff.
- Well, we're worth the good stuff.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.000
Hey, Robert?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.600
Can I show you something?
I mean, just a little food for thought?

09:12.600 --> 09:16.200
Wh... Oh. Wait, Sweetie.
They're talking about the tornado.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.700
Take a look at this video just in.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.800
Hardest hit was a state prison farm
outside the village of Stringer...

09:21.800 --> 09:24.600
...where two deaths are reported in
the wake of the storm.

09:24.600 --> 09:30.200
A funnel cloud with winds topping 150 miles per hour
tore through the isolated work camp...

09:30.200 --> 09:33.900
...passing within yards of a barracks
filled with terrified inmates.

09:33.900 --> 09:37.500
Among the dead, Captain Raybert Fellowes,
the farm's superintendent, ...

09:37.500 --> 09:43.100
...a 28-year veteran of the Department of Corrections.
A second casualty was a prison inmate:

09:43.100 --> 09:47.500
Wilson P. Rawls, age 34, of Pascagoula.
Prison authorities say...

09:47.500 --> 09:49.600
- Excuse me.
- ...whose job was to secure the prison...

09:49.600 --> 09:52.500
- You okay, June?
- ...from the oncoming storm.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.800
High winds apparently carried the man away.

09:54.800 --> 09:59.200
Though his body has not been found, Rawls
is presumed dead. In other news...

10:45.500 --> 10:48.600
You got a gun pointed at you.
Don't try to run.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.600
I ain't runnin'.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.900
Hey! Hey, that's store property.
Take those off.

10:59.900 --> 11:04.000
Oh... There's something so nice about
putting on a brand-new pair of socks.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.900
- I don't know what it is.
- I said, take those off, boy.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.800
What you think?

11:13.800 --> 11:16.300
That's me, right?

11:18.600 --> 11:22.800
- And room to grow in.
- You got an attitude, I'll say that.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.000
Get the hell up.

11:26.100 --> 11:28.900
Turn around.
Hands behind the pole.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.300
This is Bobby in security.

11:46.300 --> 11:51.500
I've detained an intruder at the Val-U-Mart
on Nine Mile Road and Route 60.

11:51.500 --> 11:55.200
I don't know how the hell he got in here.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.600
Got him cuffed in the back.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.700
Yeah, I'll hold.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.000
Is that the guy?

12:19.000 --> 12:22.400
Yeah, could be.
I guess. It was pretty dark.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.600
How'd he get away?

12:24.600 --> 12:27.700
- Whoever he was.
- You got me. The guy's like Houdini.

12:27.700 --> 12:31.600
Turned my back and he was gone.
I had him right here.

12:31.900 --> 12:35.700
You had him handcuffed... here.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.900
Can I see your handcuffs?

12:51.000 --> 12:54.400
We have a last known
address for Pinker Rawls?

13:19.400 --> 13:21.700
Hey, hello?

13:25.600 --> 13:27.600
Rawls?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.500
What's up?

13:31.500 --> 13:36.100
You're on the news, man.
They're saying you got killed.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.000
Where is she?

13:38.000 --> 13:43.600
June? She's gone. Long gone, man.
She left me, like, four years ago.

13:45.100 --> 13:48.700
You mad 'cause her and me shacked up?

13:49.100 --> 13:51.200
I'm sorry, buddy.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.800
Bo, I want what's mine.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.100
I might have her address.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
You got nothing in there but your nine.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.900
Get the hell out of my house.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.800
Bo, you're going to shoot me?

14:32.900 --> 14:34.900
Are you gonna do something?

15:04.900 --> 15:09.700
This is Rawls's last known address.
Security guard's car.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.500
Mulder.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.900
Gesundheit.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.400
Oh, my God.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.200
Pistol in his hand, slide locked open,
shell casings everywhere.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.100
I don't see any bullet
holes anywhere, Mulder.

16:06.400 --> 16:10.100
Don't recognize him from
his driver's license, do you?

16:11.400 --> 16:14.600
Bo Merkle.
This is his house.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.400
Yeah, but Rawls used to live here and
he's come back looking for something.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.100
90,000 dollars.

16:21.400 --> 16:25.600
The wire office robbery eight years ago.
The money hasn't been recovered.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.800
I don't think he spent that in prison.

16:27.800 --> 16:32.100
I don't think Mr. Merkle did either,
judging by the decor.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.200
Maybe she knows.
That's this house, isn't it?

16:35.200 --> 16:37.000
Yeah.

16:37.300 --> 16:41.800
- I can run down the name.
- Yeah, I bet Rawls is looking for her.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.700
Yeah, this is Special Agent
Dana Scully with the FBI.

16:52.700 --> 16:57.900
There's been a murder here at
922 Washington Avenue in Jackson.

16:57.900 --> 17:02.600
I need crime scene support on-site
as soon as possible. Thank you.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.599
Oh, and could you transfer me to
the records division, please?

17:22.200 --> 17:24.900
Got a name to go with the face.

17:24.900 --> 17:30.600
June Gurwitch. There's no current address,
though and, uh, no record of her since 1996.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.500
Maybe she changed her name.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.700
Maybe she was afraid she'd
end up like that.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.300
The state police have put out
an APB on Rawls.

17:40.300 --> 17:44.600
You might warn them not to shoot to kill.
He seems to find that annoying.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.300
Look, Mulder, even if those were bullets...

17:46.300 --> 17:48.800
They are. It's just that their
composition has been changed...

17:48.800 --> 17:52.100
...just like the handcuffs and
just like the prison wall.

17:52.100 --> 17:56.700
Even if these were bullets, there is no way that they could
pass through Rawls in the way that you're describing-not, ...

17:56.700 --> 17:59.900
...not without leaving him sprawled
dead on the ground for us to find.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.100
I think they just went
right through him, ...

18:02.100 --> 18:06.200
...like his wrist went through the handcuffs and
like he walked right through that prison wall.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.900
- He walks through solid objects?
- Changing their composition fundamentally, ...

18:09.900 --> 18:13.100
...making steel brittle, turning
lead bullets into powder.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.300
- And flesh into carbon.
- I don't know how else to explain...

18:15.300 --> 18:19.900
...what happened to that prison superintendent or to poor
Mr. Merkle over there, who's got no face anymore.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.700
But where's the science in all of this, Mulder?
You're talking alchemy.

18:22.700 --> 18:27.000
I'm not saying that it can't be explained
scientifically. Maybe it's the tornado.

18:27.000 --> 18:33.000
You suggested it yourself. Unusual climatic
conditions... high electrical potential...

18:33.000 --> 18:35.500
I'm sorry I even brought it up.

18:35.500 --> 18:39.700
- Okay, we both agree on who he's looking for?
- June Gurwitch.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.600
And do we have any idea of how
to find June Gurwitch?

18:42.600 --> 18:46.600
She has a sister named Jackie,
and I have the address.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.300
Hello.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.200
Hey, it's me.
Is this a good time?

18:54.200 --> 18:59.000
- No, Jackie, it is never a good time.
- Look, the Jackson City police just called me.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.600
Yeah. They're looking for you.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.600
- What'd you tell them?
- Nothing, but they brought up Pinker...

19:05.600 --> 19:07.700
...and they wanted to know what
he might want with you.

19:07.700 --> 19:12.700
- Pinker's dead. I heard it on the news today.
- Well, maybe you'd better call him...

19:12.700 --> 19:14.600
...just in case he's not.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.400
- June?
- I got to go.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.700
June?

20:02.700 --> 20:04.700
Hey, Jackie.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.600
That's not very friendly, Jackie.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.700
Jackie...

20:30.600 --> 20:33.000
Tell me where she is.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
I'm not telling you anything.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.200
Jackie Gurwitch?!

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
FBI!

21:30.900 --> 21:35.300
"I WANT WHAT'S MINE"

21:47.900 --> 21:50.300
Where'd he go?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.000
He left.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.300
Her son's spending the night at a friend's
house and she's going to meet them there.

22:02.300 --> 22:06.400
She said that she didn't tell
Rawls where her sister was.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.800
Mulder, she said that he walked
right through the wall.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.500
Bo Merkle's car is parked down
the street. That's how he got here.

22:16.500 --> 22:20.200
- I don't know how he left.
- Maybe he left on foot or he stole another car.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.900
Why would he leave without getting
the information he wanted?

22:22.900 --> 22:28.300
Well, maybe he's still in the neighborhood. I think the,
uh, local PD can search but we have to get going.

22:28.900 --> 22:31.000
- Where to?
- To Meridian.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.600
That's where June Gurwitch lives...
or June Burdett as she's now called.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.100
- Yes?
- Agents Scully and Mulder with the FBI.

23:15.100 --> 23:19.600
We are looking for a June Gurwitch,
also known as June Burdett.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.100
"also known as..."
June.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.000
Look, what's this all about?

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
An escaped convict by the name
of Wilson Pinker Rawls.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.400
We believe that he may be pursuing Ms. Gurwitch
with the intention of harming her.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.700
"Gurwitch"?
I don't understand.

23:37.100 --> 23:39.200
June?

23:47.100 --> 23:50.100
Pinker's alive, isn't he?

24:02.400 --> 24:04.900
Jackie? She and her son...?

24:04.900 --> 24:07.200
They're fine.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.800
Who is Rawls to you?

24:09.800 --> 24:11.500
A mistake.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.300
The biggest one of many.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.800
We lived together.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.900
Are you sure you know who
you're looking for?

24:23.500 --> 24:27.500
I remember one time this guy cuts Pinker off on the
highway. I mean, just cut him off-you know, ...

24:27.500 --> 24:29.900
...kind of thing that happens
to everybody every day.

24:29.900 --> 24:36.500
He followed this guy for 62 miles right over the state
line; 62 miles. Me pleading with him the whole way to stop.

24:36.500 --> 24:41.200
Follows the guy up to his house. The guy gets out of his
car, smiling. He doesn't know what's coming to him.

24:41.200 --> 24:47.300
Pinker pulls a picket off a white picket fence
and cracks that guy's skull open with it.

24:47.300 --> 24:52.000
- He's not going to stop.
- What does Rawls want?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.200
The money?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.200
$90,000 from the Bay
Saint Louis robbery?

24:58.200 --> 25:02.000
I didn't even know about that till they came
to the door to arrest him, okay?

25:02.000 --> 25:06.200
I mean, Pinker was already in
prison before I found that money.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.200
By accident.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.700
So you took it.

25:14.700 --> 25:17.600
Eventually, yeah.

25:18.200 --> 25:23.000
- I thought about it for about a week or two.
- And where's the money now?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.400
Put a down payment on this place.

25:25.400 --> 25:32.300
Bought a couple of sofas...
chintz curtains... PC for Robert.

25:41.800 --> 25:45.400
I just wanted another chance.

25:55.300 --> 26:00.100
Look, I have a job. I've got responsibilities.
I can't just disappear like this.

26:00.100 --> 26:04.400
It's best you both stay under 24-hour
guard until Rawls is apprehended.

26:04.400 --> 26:07.900
- It's for your protection.
- No, it's for her protection. Let's be clear here.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.700
This guy Rawls or whoever, he's not
looking for me. She took his money.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.700
- Robert, I'm sorry...
- Excuse me.

26:14.300 --> 26:19.500
I've got my own place. I promise to stay the hell
away from here, okay? How about it?

26:20.400 --> 26:25.200
Look, I just want to get out of here, okay?
I didn't break any laws.

26:30.300 --> 26:33.200
Don't discuss this with
anyone, Mr. Werther.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.500
I'm forgetting it ever happened.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.100
Give me your keys.

27:03.600 --> 27:06.500
Get her out of here.
I want a guard on her at all times.

27:06.500 --> 27:10.300
- Rawls was in the trunk?
- Yeah. And we took him right where he wanted to go.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.400
Mulder?

28:18.800 --> 28:23.400
"I WANT WHAT'S MINE"

28:31.100 --> 28:34.100
You think he's trying to
tell us something?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.700
Scully, look at this.

28:53.700 --> 28:58.400
I'm assuming Rawls wrote this with his
finger just like the other one. Look here.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.900
- He stopped at the mirror.
- Or the mirror stopped him.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.000
What makes an object solid, Scully?

29:04.000 --> 29:08.200
I mean, what, what prevents one solid object from
passing through another solid object, usually?

29:08.200 --> 29:10.600
Electrostatic repulsion.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.300
Individual electrons repelling one
another like magnets.

29:13.300 --> 29:18.900
Electrons. What if Rawls's ability somehow has to do
electricity? What would preclude it or contain it?

29:18.900 --> 29:24.600
Resistance against electrical current.
A good insulator like rubber, like glass.

29:24.600 --> 29:28.000
Exactly. Rawls couldn't pass
through this.

29:29.000 --> 29:34.100
Say... say that your theory is correct,
that he can walk through walls.

29:34.100 --> 29:41.300
Why go through all this effort over an old robbery score?
It's $90,000-- he could get that anywhere, right?

29:41.300 --> 29:45.100
It's not about the money.
It's never been about the money.

29:45.100 --> 29:48.800
Yet he turned this place upside down which
means he was looking for something.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.400
And I think it has to do with this.

29:51.500 --> 29:57.300
It's a lien on unpaid hospital bills
dating back to 1992...

29:57.300 --> 30:00.100
...and the patient name is June Gurwitch.

30:00.100 --> 30:05.000
And this is an IC D-9 number;
a hospital diagnostic code.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.400
- This particular one means...
- Pregnancy.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.800
Right. Specifically, c-section.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.100
This is seven years ago.

30:14.100 --> 30:17.200
That's just a few months after Rawls
was sent to a prison farm.

30:18.200 --> 30:23.500
"I want what's mine." This man is
looking for his child, Mulder.

30:24.300 --> 30:27.900
...and will return in time to take
part in meetings at the UN.

30:27.900 --> 30:33.200
A statewide manhunt is underway at this point
as escaped convict Wilson Pinker Rawls, ...

30:33.200 --> 30:38.400
...a man previously thought to be a victim of
Tuesday's storm, continues to elude police.

30:38.400 --> 30:42.300
He is to be considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.600
I'd like to call my sister.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.400
Sorry, ma'am. No calls.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.700
This is a non-smoking room, ma'am.

31:44.500 --> 31:48.700
Looks like Collins put up a fight.
Guess it wasn't enough.

31:48.700 --> 31:52.000
I can't tell you what happened
here, how Rawls got in, ...

31:52.000 --> 31:54.600
...but he took the woman with him.

31:55.100 --> 32:00.300
- Where are they headed?
- They stole a station wagon. Last seen headed south.

32:08.900 --> 32:12.000
He has to intend for June to
lead him to his child.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.100
- Yeah, we got to get there first.
- Yeah, but where? We don't have a name or an address.

32:16.100 --> 32:21.500
I mean, June may not either, for that matter.
If the child was... was adopted...

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
I think our best bet is to go through state
records but it's going to take some time.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.600
I'm going to need some equipment.
Special issue.

32:37.900 --> 32:41.100
Pinker, I apologize.

32:43.600 --> 32:47.300
Look, I'm really scared right now, okay?
Talk to me.

32:50.200 --> 32:54.000
Please... please say something.
Anything.

32:58.400 --> 33:04.200
Look, I'm sorry about the money, your money.
I shouldn't have taken it. It was wrong.

33:04.200 --> 33:07.200
I was wrong.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.400
Pinker, I can pay you back.

33:18.300 --> 33:22.000
What was it?
What'd you have?

33:23.300 --> 33:26.100
You dumb bitch. You don't even
know what I'm talking about.

33:26.100 --> 33:30.300
What'd you have?
Was it a boy or a girl?

33:31.800 --> 33:34.100
A boy... a boy.

33:34.100 --> 33:38.800
A boy... a boy... a boy.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.500
What's his name?

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
You know his name, don't you?

33:48.500 --> 33:52.700
- Trevor Andrew.
- Trevor what?

33:54.900 --> 33:56.400
Trevor Andrew.

33:56.400 --> 34:00.800
Trevor Andrew... Rawls.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.199
You never were going to tell me.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.900
I'd have gone to my grave
never knowing.

34:13.400 --> 34:18.400
But years later, a million-to-one shot, ...

34:18.400 --> 34:23.900
...I hear on the Farm from a guy who knew a
guy who knew a guy. You know what that means?

34:29.800 --> 34:34.000
That means God wanted
me to know.

34:35.000 --> 34:40.300
He fixed it so I'd hear... and then
he fixed it so I'd have passage.

34:42.699 --> 34:45.300
And I'm here.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.199
God's will.

34:51.400 --> 34:54.300
What do you want with the boy?

34:54.300 --> 34:57.100
He's my son.

35:01.500 --> 35:05.000
Now you're going to
take me to him.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.700
Yeah, can you also check her alias, please?
It's Burdett, B-u---

35:09.700 --> 35:13.400
It was a live birth,
that's all you can tell me?

35:13.400 --> 35:16.400
Yeah, can you check on
that, please?

35:16.400 --> 35:19.600
- This what you were looking for?
- Yes. Thank you.

35:22.400 --> 35:25.200
All right, thank you very much.

35:25.900 --> 35:28.200
No match on Burdett or Gurwitch.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.700
Riot slugs, rubber.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.300
Yeah.

35:33.700 --> 35:35.400
No.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.200
Thank you.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.500
It's a boy. That's all I got.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.600
- Sealed files?
- No official files.

35:41.600 --> 35:46.000
No adoption records, no records of foster care
in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, nothing.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.800
Well, maybe she didn't go
through official channels.

35:48.800 --> 35:52.800
Maybe... maybe the kid's with a
friend or a relative somewhere.

35:59.900 --> 36:02.100
Come on, Trevor, put your...

36:02.100 --> 36:05.700
Trevor, put your toys away.
Dinner's almost ready.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.500
Trevor?

36:07.900 --> 36:11.700
- I'll get it.
- No. Go wash your hands. I'll get it.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.400
Jackie, this is Agent Mulder...

36:24.900 --> 36:26.500
June.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.900
I'm so sorry.

36:30.700 --> 36:33.600
You could have saved me a trip.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.100
Where is he?

36:37.300 --> 36:39.800
My boy, where is he?

36:49.800 --> 36:52.000
Right.

36:53.800 --> 36:57.000
I appreciate all you've done.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.400
Taking care of him.

37:01.700 --> 37:04.500
You're a good mother.

37:05.700 --> 37:08.900
Better than some, I could say.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.000
Something smells good in here.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.800
What are you going to have?

37:38.600 --> 37:41.000
Hi, Aunt June.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.300
Hey, baby.

37:52.900 --> 37:57.700
Now you... you sit him back down,
and you feed him his supper.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.800
It's all right.

38:00.800 --> 38:05.000
It's going to be all right.
D-d-don't be upset.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.700
I ain't mad at you, buddy.

38:07.700 --> 38:11.400
It's okay, Trevor, Mama's here, okay?

38:15.500 --> 38:18.100
Come on, I'm not going to hurt you.

38:18.100 --> 38:20.200
It's okay, buddy.

38:20.200 --> 38:24.600
Why don't you come over here.
We'll have a man-to-man.

38:24.600 --> 38:29.700
Just have uh, a nice talk, you and me.

38:30.200 --> 38:35.400
Uh... you're Trevor, right?
Trevor Andrew.

38:35.600 --> 38:39.800
That's your name.
My name is Pinker.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.600
But you can call me Pinky.

38:49.700 --> 38:52.700
Any-anyway, uh...

38:52.700 --> 38:55.100
You and me, we're going
to take a trip.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.800
Pinker.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.700
Shut up, please.

39:06.100 --> 39:08.900
You got some stuff you
want to pack up?

39:08.900 --> 39:11.400
Some toys and stuff?

39:15.900 --> 39:18.500
Trevor...?

39:19.700 --> 39:23.100
- Jackie?
- Trevor, go. Go and pack some stuff, okay?

39:23.100 --> 39:24.700
Okay.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.400
He's a good boy.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.700
Trevor, run!

39:56.600 --> 39:58.600
Trevor!

39:59.400 --> 40:01.900
Trevor...!

40:04.100 --> 40:06.100
Trevor...!

40:06.800 --> 40:09.200
Hey, buddy.

40:15.700 --> 40:17.700
Hey, buddy.

40:22.100 --> 40:24.000
Hey, Trevor.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.900
Hey, buddy!

40:27.600 --> 40:31.400
Get him out of here, Scully.
Don't make me shoot you.

40:33.900 --> 40:36.500
- Don't make me shoot you.
- Trevor!

41:19.500 --> 41:21.000
Okay...

41:21.800 --> 41:26.800
Everything's going to be all right.
We're going to get you to a safe place.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.000
Let's go.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
Run. Run. Run.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
Get inside. Get inside.
Get inside. Get inside.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.400
Give me my son!
Trevor!

42:20.300 --> 42:22.600
Give me my son!

42:23.400 --> 42:25.400
Trevor!

42:27.700 --> 42:30.700
Give me my son, now!

42:31.900 --> 42:34.200
Shit!
No!

42:39.900 --> 42:41.900
Trevor!

44:01.200 --> 44:04.100
I had to do it.

44:05.600 --> 44:08.900
He would have hurt Trevor.
He would...

44:09.200 --> 44:12.900
God only knows what
he was thinking.

44:18.600 --> 44:21.400
What did he want?

44:21.900 --> 44:24.800
Maybe another chance.
