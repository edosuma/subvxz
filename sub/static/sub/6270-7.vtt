of East End...

00:01.799 --> 00:03.177
- I'm Wendy, by the way.
- Leo.

00:03.178 --> 00:05.077
My name's Leo. I got something
you're gonna love.

00:05.078 --> 00:06.189
Wendy:
Wow...

00:06.190 --> 00:08.093
Wait. You were just gonna go
without saying good-bye?

00:08.099 --> 00:10.554
- I feel like you're waiting for me.
- I'm not waiting.

00:12.397 --> 00:14.727
(Whispers): I love you, Archibald.

00:14.737 --> 00:17.375
I know about you and Archibald.
He doesn't care about you.

00:17.409 --> 00:19.874
- He's using you.
- Why are you lying like this?

00:19.909 --> 00:23.377
Wendy: You may have fooled her, Archibald,
but I know exactly what you're up to.

00:23.378 --> 00:25.855
- <i>Pila metalli!</i>
- No!

00:26.182 --> 00:28.482
I'll kill you as many
times as it takes!

00:29.705 --> 00:30.905
(Screams)

00:30.914 --> 00:33.918
- I'm sorry.
- You killed my father.

00:33.953 --> 00:36.387
Shh...
(Crying)

00:36.829 --> 00:40.232
You and your family
mean so much to me.

00:40.463 --> 00:42.921
I have big plans for you.

inventory by yourself.

01:47.029 --> 01:51.567
- You do not think much of me, do you?
- I am not gonna answer that.

01:51.602 --> 01:55.857
- It is hot in here.
- I know. Roger refuses to fix the furnace.

01:55.858 --> 01:58.519
- I keep bugging him about it.
- Want me to bug him?

01:58.534 --> 02:01.902
I've been told I am very
good at bugging people.

02:01.937 --> 02:04.172
I can vouch for that.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.578
What are you doing?

02:12.259 --> 02:14.260
Sorry.

02:15.242 --> 02:19.372

Oh, you woke me up.
You're flopping around like a fish.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.713
Oh. I must have been
having a bad dream.

02:45.781 --> 02:48.082
Well, you were
talking a lot.

02:48.116 --> 02:50.184
What was I saying?

02:50.218 --> 02:52.419
I don't know, I could
barely understand, but...

02:52.454 --> 02:55.255
There was definitely
some moaning.

02:55.290 --> 02:57.391
Actually, it sounded
kind of sexy.

02:57.425 --> 03:00.175
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've always done this.

03:00.176 --> 03:02.395
When I was a kid, Ingrid
used to bang on the wall

03:02.429 --> 03:05.020
in the middle of the night
and tell me to shut up.

03:05.048 --> 03:09.269
(Chuckles): Well, I am... well
aware of your sleep talk.

03:09.303 --> 03:13.540
Oh, the first time you said
you loved me, it was in your sleep.

03:13.575 --> 03:17.877
- You never told me that.
- I didn't want to embarrass you.

03:17.912 --> 03:20.914
You know I don't get
embarrassed about anything.

03:20.948 --> 03:23.182
Okay, maybe I was embarrassed.

03:23.217 --> 03:27.020
I-I... 'Cause even though
I didn't know if it counted,

03:27.054 --> 03:28.621
I said it back.

03:28.656 --> 03:30.790
It counted.

03:30.824 --> 03:32.692
What were you dreaming about?

03:32.726 --> 03:35.958
- I don't know. I don't remember.
- Nothing at all?

03:35.981 --> 03:38.632
I just don't remember
my dreams.

03:38.666 --> 03:40.967
Maybe I should listen
a little closer next time,

03:41.001 --> 03:43.603
see if I can
figure it out for myself.

03:45.239 --> 03:46.839
(Laughs softy)

03:49.806 --> 03:52.221
I gotta get to work.

(Sighs)

04:07.337 --> 04:09.765
Whoa. What's going on?

04:09.766 --> 04:12.546
You know how I have
that whole sleep-talking thing?

04:12.547 --> 04:14.866
- Yeah.
- Well, I woke Dash up last night,

04:14.867 --> 04:16.735
and I was in the middle of a dream
with Killian.

04:16.769 --> 04:19.088
- And he heard you say Killian's name?
- No, thank God,

04:19.103 --> 04:21.072
but it's only a matter
of time before he does.

04:21.106 --> 04:23.307
And the worst part is,
I don't even think about Killian

04:23.342 --> 04:26.010
when I'm awake, but sleep Freya
hasn't gotten the memo.

04:26.044 --> 04:29.364
- Oh, that is not good.
- No.

04:29.813 --> 04:32.148
The last thing I need is Dash
figuring out what happened

04:32.159 --> 04:35.165
between me and Killian because
I scream it out in my sleep.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.096
What happened
between you and Killian?

04:37.695 --> 04:39.353
Uh...

04:40.681 --> 04:43.503
- We kissed.
- What?!

04:43.528 --> 04:46.931
You said you had feelings
and desires, but when?

04:46.966 --> 04:49.731
- Um, at my engagement party.
- Oh, Freya...!

04:49.732 --> 04:52.474
I knew it was a mistake the second
I did it; I ran out instantly.

04:52.475 --> 04:55.712
I can't believe you didn't tell me this.
You tell me everything.

04:55.713 --> 04:58.348
I didn't want you to judge me.

04:58.427 --> 05:00.746
- You really think I would judge you?
- Yeah.

05:00.747 --> 05:04.120
Fine. Maybe, once upon a time,
but after all that I've been through,

05:04.150 --> 05:07.152
I am in no position
to judge anyone ever again,

05:07.187 --> 05:09.188
especially not you

05:09.222 --> 05:11.490
for a momentary slip.
I've done worse.

05:11.525 --> 05:14.674
And I assume telling Dash
the truth is not an option?

05:14.675 --> 05:17.396
No way. He can't ever,
ever find out.

05:17.430 --> 05:21.563
Okay, okay. So, there is an entire
section on dream control in this book

05:21.564 --> 05:22.959
where you
can come up with a spell.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.195
And we are just going
to need a bunch of hair,

05:25.196 --> 05:27.957
- Okay.
- Some ginger and some anise seeds.

05:28.032 --> 05:29.399
Killian’s hair?

05:29.434 --> 05:31.875
Wendy: Whew! That's taken care of.

05:31.891 --> 05:34.554
- Hey, Ingrid.
- Hey.

05:37.676 --> 05:40.614
- What is wrong with her?
- I don't know.

05:40.615 --> 05:42.515
Did she get rid of the wall?

05:42.516 --> 05:45.751
Yes. Your mother and I snuck
into the catacombs at Fair Haven

05:45.752 --> 05:49.229
and managed to erase all traces
of <i>ramus mortium</i> early this morning.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.541
Dream control?
It's a big spell.

05:53.769 --> 05:55.362
Everything okay?

05:55.363 --> 05:56.563
Mm-hmm.

05:57.656 --> 06:00.209
No, no, it's not.
Not really.

06:00.446 --> 06:04.347
Okay, tell your aunt Wendy
how she can help.

06:04.348 --> 06:06.360
Can you read my cards?

06:07.129 --> 06:11.531
Tarot is not like Ouija, Freya.
You can't just ask it questions.

06:11.532 --> 06:15.390
It reveals what it wants to reveal.
Besides, I don't like reading for family.

06:15.391 --> 06:18.832
Oh, come on, please? We could do it
after that library event tomorrow.

06:19.124 --> 06:22.429
- You are going?
- (Laughs): Yeah. Of course.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.451
Yeah. What?
Rich men, free food, open bar...

06:25.485 --> 06:28.421
I'll be there early... ish.

06:29.361 --> 06:30.902
Ingrid: Tell me something,

06:30.903 --> 06:34.778
if I told you there was a darkness
inside of me, what would you say?

06:34.804 --> 06:39.464
(Laughs): Ingrid, you are the most
proper, rule-abiding person I know.

06:39.511 --> 06:43.602
I mean, you won't even take a library book
home without officially checking it out.

06:43.636 --> 06:46.446
That is not true.
Okay, fine, it is...

06:46.472 --> 06:50.789
But there's a reason they say
you can't judge a book by its cover.

06:50.799 --> 06:53.376
Wait, are we still talking
about actual books?

06:53.377 --> 06:54.584
Man: Hi.

06:54.585 --> 06:57.505
Hi. Welcome to the East End library.
How can I help you?

06:57.531 --> 07:00.675
Can you find as many of these books
as possible and bring them to my table?

07:00.710 --> 07:04.679
- Uh, sure. It may take a few minutes.
- Just make it sooner rather than later.

07:05.473 --> 07:07.023
Hey.

07:07.047 --> 07:09.617
You can't just treat people
like your servants.

07:09.651 --> 07:12.053
If you want these books,
you can find them yourself.

07:12.054 --> 07:14.390
I thought librarians
were supposed to be helpful.

07:14.391 --> 07:16.257
We are, when people deserve it.

07:16.258 --> 07:19.260
- Oh. I get it.
- You get what?

07:19.294 --> 07:21.930
You. I'll bet you were
a hall monitor, weren't you?

07:21.964 --> 07:24.265
And you became a librarian because
you just live to shush peop...

07:24.299 --> 07:25.752
Shh!

07:25.976 --> 07:28.144
Listen, buddy, you don't know
anything about me.

07:28.145 --> 07:29.597
- I know enough.
- Oh, really?

07:29.598 --> 07:31.417
Because you're
the kind of guy who thinks

07:31.439 --> 07:32.939
yelling in the library
makes you a rebel

07:32.974 --> 07:35.474
and a rule breaker when it
really just makes you a smug,

07:35.477 --> 07:37.310
inconsiderate, disrespectful...

07:37.345 --> 07:39.980
And we are moving
over here.

07:40.014 --> 07:42.349
Maybe you're a little
darker than I thought.

07:49.168 --> 07:52.804
Hey, are you going to this
library thing for your mom?

07:52.838 --> 07:54.272
Hello to you, too.

07:54.306 --> 07:57.308
Of course I'm going;
You think I have a choice?

07:58.910 --> 08:02.337
- What? What are you looking at?
- Your hair...

08:02.338 --> 08:05.221
Do you actually mean for it to look
like that when you leave for the day?

08:05.222 --> 08:07.153
(Laughs):
Excuse me?

08:07.157 --> 08:10.655
I'm saying, this whole messy thing,
it can't really be a plan, right?

08:10.689 --> 08:12.290
Of course I don't have
a plan for my hair.

08:12.324 --> 08:13.991
I don't even know
what that means.

08:14.026 --> 08:16.060
Well, I think you
could use a haircut,

08:16.094 --> 08:18.047
and I'm pretty sure Penelope
would appreciate it.

08:18.048 --> 08:19.264
Well, I really
don't have time.

08:19.265 --> 08:22.289
Actually, you do, because luckily,
I am very talented at cutting hair.

08:22.290 --> 08:24.502
I used to do all my friends'
hair in high school.

08:24.536 --> 08:26.337
It's one of my many gifts.

08:26.371 --> 08:28.472
- But I don't want a haircut.
- I don't care.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.174
Let's go.

08:30.208 --> 08:31.675
(Sighs): Okay.

08:31.709 --> 08:36.039
- Not too short, okay?
- Relax. It's not gonna hurt at all.

08:36.635 --> 08:38.971
Hey. Stay still.

08:39.451 --> 08:41.486
(Big sigh)

08:41.520 --> 08:43.722
Man, it's like
a sauna in here.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.857
I know. I keep asking Roger
to fix the furnace.

08:45.891 --> 08:50.366
Want me to bug him for you? I hear
I'm very good at bugging people.

08:50.904 --> 08:53.998
- What did you say?
- I'm good at bugging people.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.722
What?

08:56.269 --> 08:58.103
Nothing.

08:59.868 --> 09:01.835
You okay?

09:01.836 --> 09:04.331
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

09:04.332 --> 09:06.610
- You seem worried about something.
- Mm-mm.

09:06.611 --> 09:08.746
You do that thing with your
face when you're worried.

09:08.781 --> 09:11.459
- I don't do a thing with my face.
- You're doing it right now.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.696
I'm behind you...
You can't see my face.

09:13.722 --> 09:17.625
But I can sense it. It's one of my gifts...
I can read you like a book.

09:17.626 --> 09:19.142
I don't think so.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.459
Come here.

09:33.138 --> 09:34.205
(Knocking)

09:34.239 --> 09:36.285
- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

09:36.286 --> 09:39.822
Amy. Hi. Let me just help
clean up in here.

09:39.823 --> 09:42.691
No, no, no, I got it.
I'll just see you out there.

10:00.297 --> 10:04.133
<i>Delens somnium meum hominis.</i>

10:05.369 --> 10:08.638
Oh, I hope this works.

10:13.645 --> 10:15.348
Mm.

10:23.463 --> 10:25.526
(Door closes)

10:33.080 --> 10:34.660
You okay?

10:37.003 --> 10:40.705
I bet you must be feeling
awfully confused right now.

10:40.739 --> 10:42.991
I was in a cult.

10:43.408 --> 10:46.523
I was about to marry Archibald Browning.
Wendy killed me.

10:46.524 --> 10:49.226
And I remember all of this
like it was yesterday.

10:49.227 --> 10:52.016
- Confused doesn't even begin to cover it.
- What do you mean?

10:52.050 --> 10:54.385
I know that Freya
and I always die young.

10:54.419 --> 10:58.056
- Oh, where do you come up with this?
- Mom, please!

10:58.090 --> 11:02.786
I can see all of these pictures,
but we are never old, ever.

11:03.396 --> 11:07.532
So my theory is, it's because
we always die around now.

11:08.211 --> 11:10.452
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

11:10.453 --> 11:12.403
- Yeah, you're right.
- I can't believe this.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.947
- But...
- But what?

11:14.948 --> 11:19.398
This life is
completely different.

11:19.399 --> 11:23.915
You guys have never lived this long
before, and I have kept you safe.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.574
That's my job, and

11:25.575 --> 11:28.720
you don't need to worry,
because your job

11:28.721 --> 11:34.215
is to live your life
to the fullest...

11:35.906 --> 11:38.341
(Owl hooting)

11:51.711 --> 11:54.080
(Wind whistling)

12:08.810 --> 12:12.265
(recites the spell)

12:26.480 --> 12:28.848
(Speaking Latin)

12:45.801 --> 12:47.718
Wake up.

12:49.979 --> 12:51.377
Mother...

12:52.955 --> 12:57.209
I'm not your mother.
You knew me as Athena.

12:57.210 --> 13:01.046
Welcome back, Ingrid.
I missed you.

13:08.268 --> 13:11.803
Ingrid is avoiding me, and Freya
asked me to read her cards.

13:11.804 --> 13:13.304
Ugh! So do it.

13:13.338 --> 13:16.874
- Well, I can't just read them to her.
- Don't do it.

13:16.909 --> 13:20.445
I don't know anymore, Wendy.

13:20.479 --> 13:22.439
What if it reveals
she dies young?

13:22.440 --> 13:24.765
You don't want her to find out
that way, do you?

13:24.766 --> 13:26.986
No, but she might
figure it out anyhow.

13:27.020 --> 13:30.268
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
- With her gift of premonition.

13:30.269 --> 13:33.153
Ingrid found out.
She's mad.

13:33.154 --> 13:36.060
Oh. Is that why
she's acting so weird?!

13:36.061 --> 13:39.263
Yeah, among other things.

13:39.523 --> 13:41.991
She also found out about
the time you killed her.

13:42.025 --> 13:43.826
(Gasps) What?

13:43.860 --> 13:47.096
I gave you that so that you
could help water, right?

13:47.130 --> 13:48.764
<i>Aspergo.</i>

13:48.799 --> 13:50.266
How did she find out?

13:50.300 --> 13:52.703
How do you think?
She cooked up a spell.

13:52.704 --> 13:54.274
Oh, wow.

13:54.275 --> 13:57.125
What did you tell her about
the whole dying-young thing?

13:57.126 --> 14:00.011
I wanted to tell her
to stay in her room,

14:00.012 --> 14:01.795
shut the blinds,
let me keep her safe,

14:01.796 --> 14:05.816
but instead I told her that she should
seize the moment while she can.

14:05.817 --> 14:07.860
When you don't know
how much time you have left,

14:07.861 --> 14:10.863
you want to make the most
of every second, right?

14:12.249 --> 14:13.974
Yeah.

14:20.061 --> 14:23.130
- Am I alive?
- Penelope: Not quite.

14:27.202 --> 14:29.536
There. Now...

14:29.570 --> 14:32.438
That should hold,
at least for a day or two.

14:32.473 --> 14:34.474
Why am I here?

14:34.508 --> 14:37.343
Your aunt Wendy stole something

14:37.378 --> 14:40.513
from my father Archibald,
the man you loved,

14:40.547 --> 14:43.015
and the man you died
trying to protect.

14:43.049 --> 14:46.218
- And I need it back.
- What is it?

14:46.220 --> 14:48.655
It's called <i>serpens clavem</i>.

14:48.689 --> 14:51.357
It's a golden snake.

14:51.392 --> 14:53.626
The tail looks like a key.

14:53.661 --> 14:55.862
I need you
to get it back for me.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.630
You can do this for me.

14:57.664 --> 15:02.569
I want you to get Wendy alone,
and convince her to give it back.

15:02.603 --> 15:06.407
In return, you can
kill your aunt,

15:06.441 --> 15:10.177
the one who murdered you
all those years ago.

15:20.582 --> 15:22.001
Hi, Leo.

15:22.721 --> 15:25.494
What are you doing here?
How did you even find me?

15:25.528 --> 15:27.897
I have my ways.

15:27.931 --> 15:32.947
Um, I've been thinking about
you lately, a lot, actually.

15:32.948 --> 15:35.750
That's funny, seeing as how
I never heard from you again

15:35.784 --> 15:37.484
after you pretended
to be my neighbor,

15:37.519 --> 15:39.853
slept with me, and then,
stole my prized butterfly.

15:39.888 --> 15:41.755
Was that even really your cat?

15:41.790 --> 15:43.690
Oh, that little kitty
is very much mine.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.067
(Scoffs)

15:45.068 --> 15:48.562
Listen, I-I... I really did
mean to call and apologize.

15:48.563 --> 15:51.555
So what did you do with the Himalayan
Stamped Crown you took from me?

15:51.556 --> 15:54.368
- You sell it on eBay?
- No, I didn't sell it.

15:54.403 --> 15:56.771
I really needed it.

15:56.805 --> 15:58.506
And-and I can't
explain why.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.274
All right, look,

16:00.308 --> 16:02.475
I appreciate the whole
mysterious vibe thing.

16:02.509 --> 16:04.544
I'm sure it works
on some guys.

16:04.578 --> 16:07.547
I just don't have the time
to figure you out right now.

16:07.581 --> 16:10.441
Okay? I'm busy.

16:10.442 --> 16:12.940
Okay, wait, wait,
wait. Sorry. Okay.

16:13.086 --> 16:14.554
I'm sorry.

16:14.588 --> 16:17.791
What you said was right.
I did... I did lie to you.

16:17.825 --> 16:21.127
I did... use you,
and I feel terrible about it.

16:22.569 --> 16:26.087
You may not want to figure me out,
but I want to figure you out.

16:26.430 --> 16:29.087
When we first met,
there was this connection.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.869
A spark between us.

16:32.840 --> 16:35.208
And I want to get
to the bottom of it.

16:36.001 --> 16:37.744
You do?

16:38.518 --> 16:41.482
My sister said something to me
today that made a lot of sense.

16:41.516 --> 16:43.588
You got to grab life
while you can.

16:43.589 --> 16:46.391
Who knows how many lives...
I mean, years...

16:46.622 --> 16:48.990
We all have left?

16:49.024 --> 16:52.496
Look, I'm not in the market
for someone who plays games.

16:52.497 --> 16:55.131
I get it. I get it, I do.

16:55.596 --> 16:58.532
Just give me another chance?

16:58.566 --> 17:00.334
Let's go to lunch.

17:00.368 --> 17:03.871
There will be no games,
I swear.

17:05.143 --> 17:07.367
I mean, unless
you want to play them.

17:25.717 --> 17:29.165
Oh. Oh, you're... Mmm...
So generous, darling.

17:29.166 --> 17:32.001
Oh, thank you so much for coming.
Love you.

17:32.036 --> 17:34.804
I'll be right back.
Oh, hello.

17:34.838 --> 17:36.968
Hey. (Laughs)

17:41.560 --> 17:43.287
Hey.

17:47.485 --> 17:51.021
- Ingrid? Here you are.
- Hey, George.

17:53.380 --> 17:56.794
- How are you?
- Good. It was nice of you to come today.

17:56.828 --> 17:58.362
Oh, of course.

17:58.397 --> 18:01.065
I try to support the library
in any way I can.

18:01.100 --> 18:04.941
And, uh...
Support you, obviously.

18:04.942 --> 18:06.804
I appreciate that.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.730
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

18:09.731 --> 18:11.932
- You having a good time?
- Are you kidding me?

18:11.933 --> 18:13.843
This is the most fun
I've ever had in a library.

18:13.844 --> 18:15.101
Is it?

18:15.136 --> 18:17.371
Well, I know a way
we can have even more fun.

18:17.405 --> 18:18.939
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.608
Let's go to London.

18:21.537 --> 18:23.037
What? Just like that?

18:23.038 --> 18:25.614
You're just gonna snap your fingers,
and we're gonna go to London?

18:25.615 --> 18:29.041
- Yup. How about tomorrow?
- Are you serious?

18:29.042 --> 18:33.406
I got invited to speak at a medical
conference in England in two days.

18:33.452 --> 18:35.753
Look, I know it's last minute
but, are you in?

18:35.788 --> 18:38.328
Yes, of course I am.

18:38.329 --> 18:40.332
You might be on your own
for some of it, be...

18:40.333 --> 18:41.700
I mean, I assume you just...

18:41.701 --> 18:44.242
You know, you don't want to watch me speak
about third world vaccinations all day.

18:44.243 --> 18:47.303
No offense, I think
I can fill my time.

18:47.304 --> 18:50.227
I can't believe I'm gonna finally
have a stamp on my passport.

18:50.293 --> 18:52.495
Let's make it two.
Yeah, let's make it two.

18:52.529 --> 18:55.057
Let's hop on the Chunnel,
we'll tack on a couple of days in Paris.

18:55.058 --> 18:57.268
We'll eat croissants,
drink wine.

18:57.285 --> 18:59.286
It'll be a rehearsal
for our honeymoon.

18:59.290 --> 19:03.894
You are killing me! Yes!
Yes! That sounds incredible.

19:08.899 --> 19:12.035
You do you realize we were
supposed to be having lunch,

19:12.069 --> 19:13.870
like a real first date, right?

19:13.904 --> 19:15.871
Leo: I'm just building
up an appetite.

19:15.906 --> 19:18.140
(Laughs)
I think we did that.

19:18.175 --> 19:19.976
Where do you want to go?

19:20.010 --> 19:21.911
You choose.

19:21.945 --> 19:23.613
I'm good with anything.

19:23.647 --> 19:26.015
Yes, you are.

19:30.698 --> 19:32.766
Where did you get this necklace?

19:32.801 --> 19:34.268
Looks antique. It's cool.

19:34.302 --> 19:36.037
Oh. I don't know.

19:36.071 --> 19:37.965
I've had it for so long,
I can't even remember.

19:37.991 --> 19:40.141
- Oh.
- Go get dressed so we can go.

19:40.175 --> 19:42.376
(Slapping him gently)
- Okay.

19:42.410 --> 19:44.178
Whoops.

19:44.212 --> 19:45.813
(Laughs)

19:47.716 --> 19:49.284
Anyway, I should probably
be getting back.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.853
Hey, why don't we go
and get a drink some time?

19:51.888 --> 19:55.290
That is sweet, but I'm not really
in place for that right now.

19:55.324 --> 19:58.352
What's the problem?
Are you afraid of a little fun?

19:58.353 --> 20:01.796
- No. This isn't my idea of fun.
- Oh, yeah?

20:01.831 --> 20:04.874
Why don't you...
Tell me some of your ideas?

20:04.875 --> 20:08.824
- Okay. This conversation is over.
- I don't think that it is.

20:08.837 --> 20:10.305
Fractura.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.406
(Snapping)
- Aah!

20:11.440 --> 20:13.868
You broke my fingers. What...?

20:15.538 --> 20:18.179
You should probably
move along now.

20:25.855 --> 20:30.291
You didn't have to do that.
I can take care of myself.

20:33.029 --> 20:35.864
Is there something happening
between you and Freya?

20:35.898 --> 20:39.601
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know, I thought...

20:39.636 --> 20:41.955
Just felt like I was
interrupting something earlier.

20:41.972 --> 20:43.839
A haircut.
(Laughs)

20:43.874 --> 20:46.041
Look, I know
it's none of my business,

20:46.076 --> 20:48.910
but, um, I just wondered
if you two had maybe ever...

20:48.945 --> 20:50.712
No. God, no. Amy...

20:50.747 --> 20:53.214
I just want to make sure I'm not
getting in the middle of something...

20:53.249 --> 20:56.051
Which, apparently, I'm not.
I'm gonna go get a drink, okay?

20:56.085 --> 20:58.921
- Do you want anything?
- No thanks. I'm good.

20:58.955 --> 21:01.123
(Indistinct chatter)

21:03.593 --> 21:05.962
Excuse me, we need to talk.

21:09.933 --> 21:12.134
Ever since I was a little kid,
I know when something bad

21:12.169 --> 21:14.871
is gonna happen. I get
this feeling in my stomach.

21:14.905 --> 21:17.240
And I have the feeling,
right now, out of nowhere.

21:17.274 --> 21:19.309
You're being paranoid.
Nothing bad is going to happen.

21:19.343 --> 21:21.612
I am telling you, I can
feel it in my bones.

21:21.646 --> 21:24.282
- I thought you felt it in your stomach?
- I feel it in both places.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.717
- Look, if this is about us, um...
- Whoa!

21:26.752 --> 21:29.253
Whoa, there is no us,
and there never has been.

21:30.441 --> 21:33.668
- That's not exactly true.
- Nothing is happening.

21:33.669 --> 21:37.461
Something happened, but it was
a long time ago. It was just a kiss.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.463
And we both know that
it was a huge mistake.

21:39.498 --> 21:43.768
And that is why, we are never, ever,
going to tell anyone, because it's over.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.070
Okay, relax, take a deep breath.

21:46.105 --> 21:49.474
It'll all be fine, I promise.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.942
(Sighs)

21:55.714 --> 21:58.116
Okay.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.932
(Knocking)

22:13.966 --> 22:16.367
I got it!

22:20.205 --> 22:22.606
- Ingrid!
- Aunt Wendy, you have to come with me.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.712
(Gasps) Oh, no. I forgot
the library event, didn't I?

22:25.744 --> 22:29.063
- (Gasps) Freya's going to be so pissed.
- No, no. It's mom... she's hurt.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.182
It's an emergency.
You have to come with me now.

22:31.216 --> 22:33.323
- What? Wait, let me just...
- No! Now!

22:33.338 --> 22:35.157
Leo, there's an emergency
with my sister!

22:35.188 --> 22:37.001
Wendy?

22:40.418 --> 22:41.755
What happened?

22:41.756 --> 22:44.163
This shape-shifter tried
to kill her with some dark magic.

22:44.164 --> 22:45.838
- How bad is she hurt?
- Pretty bad.

22:45.839 --> 22:48.968
The only way to help her is with
the snake key you took from Archibald.

22:49.002 --> 22:51.471
Snake key? I never said anything
about a snake key.

22:51.505 --> 22:53.573
- Yes, you did.
- No. I would remember that.

22:53.607 --> 22:55.308
I think mother may have
mentioned it.

22:55.343 --> 22:56.844
- It was gold...
- Mother?

22:58.193 --> 23:01.382
Wait a minute. How did you know
I was here? Nobody knows about Leo.

23:03.184 --> 23:04.418
Who are you?

23:04.452 --> 23:06.587
I'm your niece.

23:09.257 --> 23:12.107
The one you threw
over a railing and killed.

23:12.561 --> 23:14.561
And now you know how it feels.

23:20.815 --> 23:23.617
(water dripping slowly)

23:30.825 --> 23:33.160
<i>Expergiscendum.</i>

23:33.195 --> 23:35.763
(Gasps)

23:35.798 --> 23:37.532
(Wendy gasping loudly)

23:39.599 --> 23:41.467
You cannot move.

23:41.501 --> 23:43.028
(Gasping)

23:43.029 --> 23:45.060
The circle will not let you.

23:45.061 --> 23:48.363
You always said I was
the most powerful one of us all.

23:48.608 --> 23:51.110
Are you the shifter?

23:51.144 --> 23:53.112
(Laughs)

23:53.146 --> 23:55.647
The shifter reanimated me.

23:55.648 --> 23:59.602
I'm Ingrid, your niece.
The one you killed, remember?

23:59.607 --> 24:03.510
- What the hell do you want from me?
- I want the serpens clavem.

24:03.545 --> 24:05.879
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

24:05.914 --> 24:08.615
It was destroyed
hundreds of years ago.

24:08.650 --> 24:10.417
Hmm.

24:10.451 --> 24:12.386
(Laughs)

24:14.422 --> 24:16.858
(Gasps)

24:16.893 --> 24:20.228
(Panting)

24:20.263 --> 24:22.397
(Whimpering)

24:22.431 --> 24:25.066
<i>Ustulo!</i>

24:25.101 --> 24:27.435
(Screaming)
- (Laughs)

24:28.224 --> 24:32.066
I've been waiting
over 100 years for this revenge.

24:32.257 --> 24:34.142
<i>Ustulo rivulus!</i>

24:34.176 --> 24:36.577
(Hissing, screaming)

24:38.814 --> 24:41.382
(Panting)

24:41.417 --> 24:43.962
(Crying)

24:43.963 --> 24:46.832
(Screaming)

24:47.968 --> 24:49.603
It's you.

24:50.794 --> 24:53.395
Mike. It's Mike.

24:53.429 --> 24:55.964
Am I allowed to
sit on this bench?

24:55.998 --> 24:58.266
I completely need
to apologize

24:58.300 --> 25:02.752
for yelling at you, um,
at the library yesterday.

25:02.753 --> 25:05.505
Not a problem.
I know I can be a little...

25:05.520 --> 25:08.666
I wanted to say thank you
for helping me with that guy.

25:08.682 --> 25:11.623
Just as long as you know,
I could've handled that myself.

25:11.658 --> 25:14.493
I have no doubt.
You seem very capable.

25:14.527 --> 25:16.745
But when I saw him
follow you down the aisle,

25:16.746 --> 25:19.544
I decided to check on you
just in case.

25:20.747 --> 25:22.334
Thanks.

25:22.924 --> 25:26.239
So, you know my name.
Do I get to know yours?

25:26.273 --> 25:29.676
I'm so sorry. I'm-I'm Ingrid.
Ingrid Beauchamp.

25:29.710 --> 25:32.579
- Oh, that's a really pretty name.
- Thank you.

25:32.587 --> 25:34.992
Nice to meet you,
Ingrid Beauchamp.

25:34.993 --> 25:35.982
(Phone ringing)

25:36.016 --> 25:39.352
I should...
Oh. (Laughs)

25:39.387 --> 25:40.700
Hi, mom.

25:40.955 --> 25:43.334
Yeah. I'll be right there.

25:43.335 --> 25:46.892
I have to run, but, um,
I'll see you at the library, right?

25:46.927 --> 25:50.310
- I'm... I'm still allowed?
- (Laughing): Yes. Anytime you want.

25:50.311 --> 25:51.744
All right.

25:58.946 --> 26:02.600
___

26:07.081 --> 26:10.016
Hey, have you seen Dash?
He just disappeared from the library.

26:10.051 --> 26:13.664
Not lately. He probably got paged
to the hospital or something.

26:13.665 --> 26:15.566
You know how much
he loves saving lives.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.067
Yeah, I don't think so.

26:17.101 --> 26:20.303
- Oh, there you are. What's up, brother?
- I've been calling you...

26:20.338 --> 26:22.639
What? What?

26:22.673 --> 26:24.341
- Dash, wait!
- No, not now, Freya.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.176
Oh, my...

26:28.146 --> 26:29.813
...God.

26:38.023 --> 26:40.391
(Doorbell rings)

26:46.865 --> 26:50.222
- Hey. Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Wendy.

26:50.223 --> 26:53.204
She was at my place earlier,
but she left her bag, and said

26:53.205 --> 26:55.504
something about her
sister being in trouble?

26:55.808 --> 27:00.532
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- Oh... right. I'm Leo.

27:00.533 --> 27:04.395
I'm Joanna. I'm Wendy's sister,
and, uh, I'm fine.

27:04.396 --> 27:06.485
Um, tell...
Exactly what happened?

27:06.519 --> 27:10.989
Well, I-I was changing clothes,
and someone knocked on the door.

27:11.023 --> 27:14.126
Wendy went to go answer it, and
by the time I came out to see

27:14.160 --> 27:16.462
what was going
on, she was gone.

27:16.555 --> 27:20.079
You haven't seen her, either, have you?
You think she's okay?

27:20.113 --> 27:22.581
I'm sure it's just
some big misunderstanding.

27:22.616 --> 27:26.718
Um, I'll let her know you were here.
Thanks for telling me.

27:28.655 --> 27:31.089
(Quietly):
Damn it.

27:32.381 --> 27:35.784
(Speaking Latin)

27:37.228 --> 27:39.264
Come on, find the light.

27:39.298 --> 27:41.733
(Speaking foreign language)

27:42.744 --> 27:45.207
Show me the necklace.

27:45.317 --> 27:47.718
(Speaking Latin)

27:50.510 --> 27:52.878
(Speaking Latin)

27:57.783 --> 27:59.584
(Freya sighs, footsteps)

27:59.774 --> 28:03.272
- Dash, what are you doing?
- I'm leaving early for London.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.712
I think it's better
if I go alone.

28:04.746 --> 28:06.981
Look, I-I don't know what
you think you know about...

28:07.015 --> 28:09.563
I heard you, Freya,
at the library.

28:09.564 --> 28:11.465
Heard everything
you said to him.

28:11.499 --> 28:14.234
Did you hear me say
that it was a huge mistake?

28:14.269 --> 28:16.837
That it was in the past,
and didn't mean anything?

28:16.871 --> 28:19.426
- Come on, you weren't...
- I wasn't what?!

28:19.427 --> 28:21.622
Huh? I wasn't supposed
to find out?

28:21.623 --> 28:23.020
Yeah, I could've guessed that.

28:23.021 --> 28:26.456
Wait, Dash, look, I love you.
Please, just... This was a big mis...

28:26.457 --> 28:28.557
I can't even look
at you right now.

28:28.558 --> 28:29.959
(Sighs)

28:33.597 --> 28:36.332
This will end if you tell me
where the snake is.

28:36.366 --> 28:37.700
It's gone.

28:37.734 --> 28:40.535
(Breath quivering)

28:40.570 --> 28:43.539
But if I knew where it was,
I wouldn't tell you anyway.

28:43.573 --> 28:46.575
You were corrupt then,
and you're corrupt now.

28:46.609 --> 28:48.219
Fine.

28:48.220 --> 28:51.190
Then I guess I get to kill you.

28:51.882 --> 28:54.351
(Loud breathing)
Go ahead.

28:54.385 --> 28:58.388
And then I'll sit here...
And wait.

28:58.805 --> 29:04.026
And when you come back to life, I'll kill
you again, as many times as it takes.

29:04.061 --> 29:07.563
Ingrid, wait. We-we...

29:09.233 --> 29:11.467
I killed you by mistake.

29:11.502 --> 29:14.537
I'm still your aunt.

29:14.571 --> 29:18.240
You're still my niece.
This isn't who you are.

29:20.576 --> 29:24.644
Actually, I think
this is exactly who I am.

29:24.678 --> 29:26.145
No.

29:26.180 --> 29:27.913
<i>Acidum adere!</i>

29:27.948 --> 29:29.481
(Screaming)

29:37.947 --> 29:39.567
Ingrid?

29:40.357 --> 29:42.758
(Sighs heavily)

29:47.066 --> 29:50.102
- No, mom, please don't.
- You're not my daughter.

29:50.136 --> 29:52.476
Look in my eyes;
You know who I am.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.220
I'm Ingrid.

29:55.608 --> 29:59.012
Okay, we'll talk
about this later.

30:01.415 --> 30:04.284
Let's get your aunt
and get her out of here.

30:04.319 --> 30:05.419
(Screams)

30:05.453 --> 30:06.821
<i>Reverte!</i>

30:06.822 --> 30:08.922
(Sighs)

30:12.326 --> 30:16.663
<i>Reverte ad vestrum
priorem statum.</i>

30:16.697 --> 30:18.899
But you don't kill people.

30:18.933 --> 30:21.069
You were already dead.

30:21.103 --> 30:23.471
(Gasps)

30:44.002 --> 30:48.013
- So it wasn't the shifter?
- No.

30:48.907 --> 30:51.309
It was another enemy
from a long time ago,

30:51.343 --> 30:53.478
I assume, sent by the shifter.

30:53.513 --> 30:57.393
- Who, what enemy?
- No one you'd know about.

30:58.451 --> 31:01.487
I've healed her burns, so
she's going to be okay.

31:01.521 --> 31:02.488
(Sighs)

31:02.522 --> 31:04.256
All we can do now is wait.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.589
Dash is going
to London without me,

31:07.590 --> 31:09.909
and I don't even know
if he still wants to marry me.

31:10.897 --> 31:15.508
- Sweetie, what happened?
- He found out.

31:16.135 --> 31:18.504
I knew it was gonna happen.

31:18.538 --> 31:20.706
I just... ever since
I found out what I am,

31:20.741 --> 31:22.953
my intuition just
keeps getting

31:22.954 --> 31:27.279
stronger and stronger, and
I, I need to trust myself more.

31:27.314 --> 31:30.383
- I'm so sorry, Freya.
- Dash found out about what?

31:30.417 --> 31:32.985
About Killian and me.
We kissed.

31:33.019 --> 31:36.636
- At her engagement party.
- Freya: It was a mistake!

31:36.637 --> 31:38.701
The biggest mistake
of my entire life.

31:38.709 --> 31:43.262
- Because I'm a terrible person.
- You're not a terrible person.

31:43.296 --> 31:46.165
(Laughs) People make mistakes.

31:46.199 --> 31:48.134
Not like this, mom.

31:48.168 --> 31:51.003
Oh, believe me,
I've done much, much worse.

31:51.038 --> 31:54.674
I think it's good
that Dash went away.

31:54.709 --> 31:58.245
It'll give him some alone time
to remember why he loves you so much.

31:58.279 --> 32:01.582
- You really think that?
- Definitely.

32:01.616 --> 32:04.652
Why are we watching
aunt Wendy sleep?

32:04.686 --> 32:07.988
- She's not asleep, she's dead.
- Oh, my God, again?

32:08.023 --> 32:10.077
(Chuckling):
It's okay.

32:10.217 --> 32:11.927
She won't be long now.

32:11.961 --> 32:13.829
(All gasp)

32:13.863 --> 32:15.263
Oh, God.

32:15.297 --> 32:16.873
Oh, that never gets any better.

32:16.874 --> 32:19.868
Welcome back... it's nice
to see you breathing again.

32:19.902 --> 32:23.038
Okay, so we're all here.
What did I miss?

32:23.072 --> 32:29.469
You got killed, um, and, a friend named
Leo stopped by, looking for you.

32:29.470 --> 32:33.015
Seemed concerned,
seemed to like you.

32:33.049 --> 32:34.050
(Chuckles)

32:34.084 --> 32:37.356
(Chuckling): I guess
you took my advice, huh?

32:37.357 --> 32:39.055
Yeah, a little bit.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.791
- (Laughs) All right, come on, girls.
- Yeah.

32:41.826 --> 32:44.493
Let's let Wendy get
her strength back.

32:44.528 --> 32:45.561
- Ingrid.
- Yeah.

32:45.595 --> 32:48.030
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Of course.

32:48.065 --> 32:51.868
- So we're okay?
- I mean, we're even now?

32:51.902 --> 32:53.102
What do you mean?

32:53.103 --> 32:55.738
Oh, your mom
didn't tell you?

32:55.773 --> 32:59.621
You killed me. Oh, I mean,
you know, the you from 1906.

32:59.622 --> 33:00.885
What?

33:00.886 --> 33:03.479
The shifter reanimated
you... the old you...

33:03.514 --> 33:05.515
And sent you after
me for revenge.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.851
Oh, my God, I'm...

33:07.885 --> 33:10.353
So, where is old me now?

33:10.988 --> 33:12.558
Uh, um, I'm not sure.

33:12.559 --> 33:15.592
You have to ask your mom about that,
but I'm sure she took care of it.

33:15.626 --> 33:19.162
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay, it wasn't you.

33:19.196 --> 33:23.282
Yes, it was me. I mean,
whatever she did, I'm capable of.

33:23.283 --> 33:26.502
- We're the same person.
- No, honey, it doesn't work like that.

33:26.537 --> 33:28.404
Every life is
completely different.

33:28.438 --> 33:32.133
- Except every life ends about now.
- Not necessarily.

33:32.134 --> 33:36.035
- If history is any indication.
- History can change; I've seen it.

33:37.204 --> 33:39.973
It just feels
like impossible odds.

33:40.007 --> 33:43.643
I mean, ever since
I discovered what I am...

33:43.678 --> 33:46.513
It's been an endless parade
of bad news.

33:46.547 --> 33:48.148
Hmm.

33:48.182 --> 33:50.918
I feel like I don't know
who I am anymore.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.950
Well, if it makes any difference,
I know who you are.

33:55.468 --> 33:58.369
You have such a good heart.

33:58.386 --> 34:01.288
You're my favorite Ingrid yet.

34:01.729 --> 34:02.862
(Laughs)

34:02.896 --> 34:05.064
Thank you.

34:05.552 --> 34:09.817
- I love you, sweetie.
- I love you, too.

34:13.407 --> 34:14.373
(Knocking)

34:14.408 --> 34:17.542
- Thought you went home.
- Here to help with inventory.

34:17.577 --> 34:21.246
- Man, is it hot in here.
- Roger refuses to fix the furnace.

34:21.280 --> 34:24.248
- I keep bugging him about it.
- Want me to bug him?

34:24.283 --> 34:26.485
I've been told I'm very
good at bugging people.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.889
You have to go.

34:30.922 --> 34:32.858
What?

34:32.891 --> 34:37.797
This is a dream... the last
dream I'll have about you.

34:37.831 --> 34:41.132
- I'm saying good-bye.
- Wait, no, you can't.

34:41.167 --> 34:42.701
Freya, listen to me.

34:42.735 --> 34:44.918
- None of this is what you think.
- Bye, Killian.

34:45.272 --> 34:46.639
(Gasps)

34:46.672 --> 34:48.674
(Sighs)

35:10.531 --> 35:12.932
Hey, you're up.

35:12.967 --> 35:15.232
- Hey.
- Well, I did something right.

35:15.233 --> 35:19.602
The spell I did worked. I think
I'm finally done dreaming of Killian.

35:19.939 --> 35:23.133
- What are you doing?
- Freya, sit down.

35:26.545 --> 35:29.915
I made a rule that I would never
deal the deck for you girls.

35:29.949 --> 35:31.583
I think it's asking
for problems,

35:31.617 --> 35:33.986
but I know
you're confused

35:34.020 --> 35:38.290
and curious, so
I did it for you.

35:38.325 --> 35:41.508
- Well, what does it say?
- It's complicated.

35:42.242 --> 35:44.863
It's more complicated
than I realized.

35:44.897 --> 35:47.713
Does it say something
about my future with Dash?

35:47.721 --> 35:49.689
Are we still getting married?

35:49.723 --> 35:51.424
I don't know
what will happen.

35:51.458 --> 35:55.136
There's a shroud
around the future

35:55.285 --> 35:59.098
because your choice
isn't yet made.

35:59.133 --> 36:00.433
What?

36:00.467 --> 36:02.936
(Chuckles) This is you

36:02.970 --> 36:07.707
in the center of everything,
surrounded by love and family.

36:07.708 --> 36:09.093
This is the problem.

36:09.094 --> 36:12.645
What, the trickster
and the emperor?

36:12.679 --> 36:14.313
They're mirror
images, they're often

36:14.348 --> 36:17.716
depicted as brothers...
One dark, one light.

36:17.751 --> 36:19.985
So one is Dash
and one is Killian?

36:20.020 --> 36:24.957
Mm-hmm, and, according
to the cards, they divide your heart.

36:24.991 --> 36:28.227
Well, Killian is obviously
the dark one, right?

36:28.261 --> 36:31.296
The trickster
could be either.

36:31.331 --> 36:34.566
He could be dark
masquerading as light.

36:34.601 --> 36:37.236
That's what he does...
He confuses you.

36:37.270 --> 36:39.972
What does that even mean?

36:40.006 --> 36:44.858
According to the cards,
you will love them both.

36:45.366 --> 36:47.689
You have a choice to make.

36:47.690 --> 36:52.695
One man is your soul mate,
the other man's your destroyer.

36:53.187 --> 36:56.957
Whoever you choose
will decide your fate.

37:03.295 --> 37:06.431
- Oh, finally.
- What?

37:06.793 --> 37:09.762
I've been wanting to talk to you
since I came back to life,

37:09.763 --> 37:12.837
but I didn't want to say anything
in front of the girls.

37:12.872 --> 37:14.005
Why?

37:14.040 --> 37:17.843
You know what?
I could use a drink.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.640
So...

37:24.768 --> 37:28.120
So, you know, ever since I had
the first vision of you being in danger,

37:28.154 --> 37:32.118
we've been trying to figure out who
the shifter is and what they want, right?

37:32.119 --> 37:36.395
You mean aside
from destroying us?

37:37.544 --> 37:40.045
Well, I still don't know
who the shifter is,

37:40.046 --> 37:43.369
but I think I know what they
want, and it's not good news.

37:44.447 --> 37:46.382
So, what is it?

37:47.515 --> 37:51.199
Dead Ingrid kept asking
for the serpens clavem...

37:51.233 --> 37:53.001
The golden snake.

37:53.434 --> 37:55.645
- Really...?
- Yeah.

37:57.506 --> 37:59.474
Well, why is she asking you?

37:59.508 --> 38:02.043
I don't know, she thought
I stole it from Archibald,

38:02.077 --> 38:05.513
and I kept telling her that it was
destroyed, and she didn't believe me.

38:05.548 --> 38:07.315
It was destroyed, right?

38:07.350 --> 38:08.984
Yes, of course.

38:09.111 --> 38:11.279
Are you sure?

38:12.779 --> 38:14.638
I'm just saying,
what if you're wrong?

38:14.639 --> 38:16.192
What if it's still
out there

38:16.193 --> 38:18.827
and the shifter gets a hold
of it and opens the portal?

38:18.861 --> 38:21.129
The key no longer exists.

38:21.163 --> 38:22.630
I saw it get destroyed.

38:22.665 --> 38:27.335
No one's opening that
portal ever again.

38:27.370 --> 38:29.232
Okay, but
the <i>ramus mortium</i>...

38:29.256 --> 38:31.941
It was growing in the
catacombs near the entrance.

38:31.942 --> 38:35.397
I think that's more
than a coincidence, right?

38:35.778 --> 38:40.182
No one can open that door
without the key.

38:40.216 --> 38:41.989
The key is gone.

38:41.990 --> 38:45.250
Wendy, stop worrying.

38:46.422 --> 38:48.857
Well, it's a lot to worry about.

38:49.859 --> 38:52.160
(Sighs)

38:52.195 --> 38:54.530
What?

38:57.434 --> 38:59.601
Your necklace... it's red.

39:03.288 --> 39:06.623
This is your last life.

39:18.955 --> 39:21.256
I need more power.

39:26.463 --> 39:28.497
Yes.

39:56.627 --> 39:59.629
♪

40:24.221 --> 40:26.466
Thank God...
