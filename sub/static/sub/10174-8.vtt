They're my best friends.

brains, honestly. - Mm-hm, lovely.

And, uh, they're teachers right
now. They teach middle school.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.863
They pretend to be the same person.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.966
It's genius.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.034
Whoa. Uh... hello.

17:52.136 --> 17:53.035

17:53.137 --> 17:54.637
What do you mean, "Test results"?

17:54.739 --> 17:55.871
You have them.

17:55.974 --> 17:57.339
I have to get this... this is important.

17:57.441 --> 17:59.075
- I'm so sorry, it's rude.
- Take it, take the call.

17:59.176 --> 18:00.843
Okay. I'll be right back.

18:02.947 --> 18:04.379

18:11.361 --> 18:13.341
Where'd you get the corsage, Ab?

18:36.979 --> 18:39.124
My diaphragm...

18:39.159 --> 18:41.481
I left it...

18:41.583 --> 18:42.849
Cathy comic.

18:42.951 --> 18:45.217
- I left my diaphragm.
- Diaphragm?

18:45.319 --> 18:47.419
Yeah, I've just started using it.

18:47.522 --> 18:50.290
And I gotta go 'cause
someone's gonna get it.

18:55.563 --> 18:57.530
What kind of florist is this?

18:57.632 --> 18:59.069
She's cut off.

19:01.802 --> 19:03.101
Hey.

19:03.203 --> 19:05.336
Oh, shit. You okay?

19:05.438 --> 19:07.248
- You alright?
- Whoo!

19:07.283 --> 19:08.707
Okay.

19:08.809 --> 19:10.942
Yeah? Okay.

19:11.045 --> 19:12.243
You're safe. Cheers.

19:12.345 --> 19:14.680
Happy anniversary, right?

19:14.782 --> 19:16.404
I can't believe you remembered.

19:17.499 --> 19:18.448
Remembered.

19:18.551 --> 19:20.582
Four weeks ago was our first kiss.

19:21.914 --> 19:26.917
I... obviously remember
when we kissed first.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.406
Yeah. You know, just gonna...

19:37.441 --> 19:38.401
Ooh.

19:38.503 --> 19:39.975
- Thank you.
- Oh, that's great.

19:40.010 --> 19:41.604
Where's Abbi? I'm starving.

19:44.910 --> 19:46.810
Trey.

19:46.912 --> 19:49.112
I'm getting emotional right now.

19:49.214 --> 19:50.580
And I don't want you
to see me like this.

19:50.682 --> 19:53.481
- Hey, it's okay.
- No, I don't want you to see me like this.

19:53.584 --> 19:54.750
Okay.

19:54.852 --> 19:56.427
I'm gonna go to the
coat room or something.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.982
- Okay.
- I'm not feeling...

19:58.017 --> 19:59.819
We need to think about us.

19:59.854 --> 20:01.117
- Wow. Okay.
- I'm gonna be right back.

20:01.152 --> 20:02.513
Alright, hey, take as long as you need.

20:02.548 --> 20:04.879
- Okay, I will... I'm gonna.
- Okay.

20:11.741 --> 20:13.367
Oh, here she is.

20:13.469 --> 20:16.244
Sorry, there was a long
line at the shit factory.

20:16.279 --> 20:17.905
Oh, Abbi.

20:19.508 --> 20:21.575
- Okay.
- Eat, Abbi.

20:23.468 --> 20:26.679
Well, um, with this rare
moment of silence, um,

20:26.782 --> 20:28.815
there is something I'd like to share.

20:28.917 --> 20:30.316
Um...

20:32.487 --> 20:33.764
Mom?

20:33.799 --> 20:35.255
Mom, are you okay?

20:35.357 --> 20:36.823
- Mom, are you okay?
- Honey...

20:36.925 --> 20:38.225
- She's choking!
- She's choking... help.

20:38.326 --> 20:40.413
She's choking. She's choking, help!

20:40.448 --> 20:42.061
Help, somebody, please help.

20:42.163 --> 20:43.796
Trey, Trey, help!

20:44.665 --> 20:46.120
- Coming!
- Please, somebody.

20:46.155 --> 20:47.532
Somebody help!

20:47.635 --> 20:49.299
- Somebody!
- Does anybody know CPR?

20:57.178 --> 20:59.195
Here we go! Work with me.

20:59.230 --> 21:03.481
Hoh!

21:03.583 --> 21:04.540
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.

21:04.575 --> 21:06.225
Are you okay, honey?

21:06.260 --> 21:07.185
Can you breath?

21:07.287 --> 21:08.186
Are you okay?

21:08.288 --> 21:10.221
Oh, god damn lychee.

21:10.323 --> 21:13.185
Oh, Jesus, that was fucking scary.

21:13.220 --> 21:14.025
- Sit down.
- You okay?

21:14.127 --> 21:15.093
- Yeah.
- Take it easy.

21:15.195 --> 21:16.059
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:16.162 --> 21:19.163
Thank you.

21:19.265 --> 21:21.516
- Trey?
- Who the fuck is Trey?

21:21.551 --> 21:23.600
Kirk Steele.

21:23.702 --> 21:27.504
Abbi, how did you know Trey was here?

21:27.606 --> 21:28.571
Oh.

21:28.674 --> 21:30.247
We're on a date.

21:30.282 --> 21:31.775
Oh my God.

21:31.877 --> 21:33.936
- This is not...
- Oh my God.

21:34.779 --> 21:36.212
Oh my God!

21:36.314 --> 21:38.356
The condom in your room?

21:38.391 --> 21:40.082
The whole time?

21:40.185 --> 21:41.583
The whole time?

21:41.686 --> 21:43.953
The whole time!

21:44.055 --> 21:45.188
I have to go.

21:45.290 --> 21:47.223
I have to leave now. I have to go.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.326
Ilana, wait.

21:51.428 --> 21:53.318
Okay, show's over.

21:53.931 --> 21:56.331
Uh, guys, I have some big news to share.

21:56.433 --> 21:58.300
- What?
- Um, I got a promotion

21:58.401 --> 22:00.468
and I'm moving to London.

22:00.570 --> 22:03.004
No you're not. Sit down
and eat your dinner.

22:03.106 --> 22:04.539
Yes.

22:05.442 --> 22:07.774
Madonna, Rihanna, Ilana.

22:07.877 --> 22:09.471
Madonna, Rihanna, Ilana.

22:09.684 --> 22:12.000
- Hey.
- Ilana, I am so sorry.

22:12.035 --> 22:13.547
Dude, I should have told you about Trey.

22:13.649 --> 22:16.350
I don't know, I was like...
I was embarrassed and,

22:16.452 --> 22:18.285
dude he does not mean anything to me.

22:18.387 --> 22:21.349
He is a guilty pleasure.
He's like a joke.

22:23.292 --> 22:24.657
Trey, no, no, wait... wait.

22:24.759 --> 22:27.260
I'm not a joke, Abbi.

22:27.362 --> 22:28.461
I thought we were having fun and...

22:28.563 --> 22:30.429
We were... I was having
a really good time.

22:30.531 --> 22:32.298
This really sucks, you know.

22:33.902 --> 22:35.168
I'm gonna go.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.369
Wait, hold on.

22:36.471 --> 22:39.301
Trey, I did not mean like
joke, like, like that.

22:40.742 --> 22:42.741
Ilana, I'm so sorry.

22:42.843 --> 22:45.377
I will never keep a
secret from you again.

22:45.479 --> 22:47.337
I promise. You're my best friend.

22:47.372 --> 22:48.914
- I-I-I... it was just
coincidence. - I know, I know.

22:49.016 --> 22:50.859
- It's not even that.
- I was gonna tell you, I swear.

22:50.894 --> 22:54.186
It's not even that. That's not
even it even though it was really...

22:54.288 --> 22:55.420
jarring and...

22:55.522 --> 22:58.923
and I, like, didn't know what was
going on and he's so sweet, you know.

22:59.025 --> 23:03.127
And, like, tight body
and I'm gonna want full

23:03.229 --> 23:07.265
dick deets when I'm
done feeling, but, um...

23:07.367 --> 23:09.100
Lincoln broke up with me.

23:09.639 --> 23:12.728
Whatever that means, you know?

23:12.763 --> 23:16.172
My God, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

23:16.275 --> 23:19.178
- He met some beautiful queen...
- A real queen?

23:19.213 --> 23:21.511
No, a queen like, like us.

23:21.613 --> 23:24.514
You know, he wants to be
monogamous with her and he should.

23:24.616 --> 23:27.250
He deserves whatever he wants.

23:27.352 --> 23:30.353
And he doesn't even want to be friends.

23:30.455 --> 23:32.788
You know, he never really did.

23:32.890 --> 23:35.324
I just never heard it.

23:35.426 --> 23:38.060
Okay. It's gonna be okay.

23:39.730 --> 23:42.831
Okay, now is the time
you tell me dick deets.

23:45.763 --> 23:47.182
He's not responding to my texts.

23:47.232 --> 23:49.299
I guess I'm just gonna
have to apologize at work.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.401
Okay, what else have I
been keeping a secret?

23:52.503 --> 23:56.706
I think that I was
starting to kinda like Trey.

23:56.808 --> 23:58.672
Like... like-like?

23:58.707 --> 24:01.711
Like, like-like.

24:02.814 --> 24:05.132
- That fucking sucks.
- Yeah.

24:06.217 --> 24:08.550
Um, I'm really attracted

24:08.652 --> 24:11.540
to pre-Weight Watchers Jennifer Hudson.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.255
I once keyed this guy's car, uh,

24:14.358 --> 24:16.290
- because he called me a dirty Jew.
- I hate that.

24:16.393 --> 24:19.427
So, I keyed a big Star of David

24:19.529 --> 24:22.130
right onto his driver-side door.

24:22.165 --> 24:25.646
I got super blazed before
babysitting Oliver...

24:26.702 --> 24:28.134
and...

24:28.237 --> 24:31.137
I took off my bra 'cause I was,
like, feeling loose and, like,

24:31.172 --> 24:35.509
oppressed and wanted to, like,
chill and I left my bra in his room.

24:37.602 --> 24:40.342
That was probably a
whole thing that you never

24:40.377 --> 24:42.474
found out about again,
because you couldn't admit it.

24:43.084 --> 24:45.284
- You can't admit...
- No, and then, like...

24:45.387 --> 24:47.987
- like, who knows?
- Right, it wasn't sexual.

24:48.089 --> 24:50.220
- Yeah, but, no offense... no offense...
- But I'm just like...

24:50.255 --> 24:51.657
That's a bra.

24:51.760 --> 24:52.781
Oh.

24:52.816 --> 24:54.059
That's a bra!
