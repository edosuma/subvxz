00:16.367 --> 00:18.297
(Punch bag thudding)

00:24.633 --> 00:26.573
(Dogs barking)

00:35.733 --> 00:38.203
(Talk radio playing)

00:38.233 --> 00:40.803
Another scorcher
here in Barco.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.500
All your favourite hits.

00:44.533 --> 00:48.173
But first here's the news
and sport.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.800
PRESENTER: Temperatures hit
41 degrees again yesterday.

00:51.833 --> 00:56.333
Forecasters are warning of
record-breaking temperatures.

00:56.367 --> 00:58.297
(Children squeal and laugh)

01:00.800 --> 01:02.600
(Train's hooter blares
in distance)

01:06.300 --> 01:08.230
(In Malayalam):

01:25.400 --> 01:27.330
(Engine fails to start)

01:37.167 --> 01:38.797
Just one more day.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.833
That's all I'm asking for.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.497
Please?

01:45.433 --> 01:47.373
(Engine splutters into life)

02:13.500 --> 02:16.670
Acute dehydration, he'll need
another bag or two of saline.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.100
That's assuming we get
the delivery, of course.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.703
Mr Sharma, I have told you
to stop scratching.

02:21.733 --> 02:24.473
I know it's uncomfortable but
you're making it worse.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.167
You're early. Worms to catch?

02:28.200 --> 02:30.330
I couldn't sleep.
I thought I'd get a head start.

02:30.367 --> 02:33.127
Snap. Great minds et cetera.

02:33.167 --> 02:35.227
Although maybe
it's a female thing.

02:35.267 --> 02:37.427
Thank you. Oh, yeah.

02:37.467 --> 02:40.327
Incipient heat stroke.

02:40.367 --> 02:44.027
We'll have to re-check her renal
functions later this morning.

02:44.067 --> 02:46.727
If it's OK, she walks.
We need every bed we can get.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.767
- Sure.
- How's your new place?

02:48.800 --> 02:50.000
Great.

02:50.033 --> 02:53.533
Although my landlady is very
keen that I marry her nephew.

02:53.567 --> 02:55.497
Consider it. Long engagement.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.697
Could save on rent.

02:58.733 --> 03:00.333
What happened to him?

03:02.133 --> 03:04.373
Tourist.
Got too close to a ceiling fan.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.800
Of course, what he really needs
is a brain transplant

03:06.833 --> 03:09.703
but there are some things beyond
even my considerable talents.

03:09.733 --> 03:12.303
- Why aren't you writing this?
- It's up here. Steel trap.

03:12.333 --> 03:16.273
Then how about a new challenge?
Your first solo night shift.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.100
Unless, of course,
you have other plans?

03:18.133 --> 03:19.833
No, tragically,
I'm all yours tonight.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.527
Good.
Then consider yourself on trial.

03:22.567 --> 03:24.467
Right, time for
morning briefing.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.070
The stragglers
should have arrived by now.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.030
Ready for action, Dr Walker?

04:01.267 --> 04:04.367
Now, this damn heat wave is
still causing us problems.

04:04.400 --> 04:08.230
We've treated 16 cases of heat
stroke already this week.

04:08.267 --> 04:11.667
It's utterly oppressive. I've
never known anything like this.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.700
Heat is simply a state of mind.

04:13.733 --> 04:16.673
The human body is perfectly
adapted to deal with it.

04:16.700 --> 04:20.100
If you wish to be cool, you
simply have to believe.

04:20.132 --> 04:22.303
Clearly my faith is lacking.

04:22.333 --> 04:25.533
So, Dr Varma aside,
we shall all have to cope.

04:25.567 --> 04:27.767
Although we're low on IV fluids,
I think?

04:28.733 --> 04:30.433
Sister?

04:30.467 --> 04:32.667
Sorry. New supplies
were ordered yesterday.

04:32.700 --> 04:36.430
- I can chase them this morning.
- Please do.

04:36.467 --> 04:39.727
Finally, Dr Walker will complete
our outstanding home visit.

04:39.767 --> 04:42.167
There's been a request
from the Mathew farms,

04:42.200 --> 04:44.200
about 20 miles up in the hills.

04:44.233 --> 04:47.833
Do you think that's prudent?
I mean, sending her alone.

04:47.867 --> 04:49.767
Murali Mathew can be difficult.

04:49.800 --> 04:53.200
She needs to be able to handle
our most challenging patients.

04:53.233 --> 04:55.373
Unless, of course,
you don't feel you're up to it?

04:55.400 --> 04:57.330
I'm sure I can handle him.

05:01.300 --> 05:04.630
(Bell ringing)

05:04.667 --> 05:07.727
Come this way. Make way
for the wheelchair, thank you.

05:07.767 --> 05:10.367
Not now. Female ward.
What is this?

05:11.167 --> 05:13.327
Wait!

05:13.367 --> 05:16.197
- Do you have enough gauze?
- Yep.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.603
Murali Mathew is
a tricky customer.

05:18.633 --> 05:21.073
Maybe you should take
your boxing gloves.

05:24.567 --> 05:26.097
DELIVERY MAN: Dr Walker?

05:27.100 --> 05:29.230
Dr Ruby Walker?

05:29.267 --> 05:31.127
- See you later.
- Ruby Walker?

05:31.167 --> 05:33.097
This way.

05:40.233 --> 05:42.173
- You need to sign here.
- Oh, yeah.

05:48.133 --> 05:50.173
What?

05:50.200 --> 05:52.200
I decided to upgrade.

05:52.233 --> 05:55.403
Capable off road, more range,
higher top speed.

05:55.433 --> 05:57.603
Oh, and so much more stylish.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.397
Looks aren't everything.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.303
I prefer something
I can rely on.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.573
Call me when it breaks down
in the middle of nowhere.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.570
It won't.
So I don't need rescuing.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.600
I'm not rescuing you.

06:08.633 --> 06:11.473
I just want to be the first to
know when it happens.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.100
OK.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.697
(Engine revs)

06:20.500 --> 06:22.430
(Horn toots)

06:31.400 --> 06:34.400
LYDIA: Your mother has been
severely affected by the heat.

06:34.433 --> 06:36.033
She's critically dehydrated

06:36.067 --> 06:38.627
and I suspect
her kidneys are already failing.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.567
- How old is she?
- 99 years, Doctor.

06:43.267 --> 06:45.267
We'll help her as best we can.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.170
But in circumstances like these,
there's not much we can do.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.200
Oh, please, Dr Fonseca.

06:50.233 --> 06:53.103
We've travelled many miles
in this heat for your help.

06:53.133 --> 06:55.133
Only you can save her.

06:55.167 --> 06:58.567
I understand. But sometimes
a dignified death in your bed...

06:58.600 --> 07:01.370
My mother has seen such things
in her life, Doctor.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.800
Do you know she touched
Mahatma Ghandi's dhoti?

07:04.833 --> 07:07.673
Ask her, she'll tell you.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.530
Still everything is clear
like yesterday.

07:10.567 --> 07:12.667
And these are her wishes too,
are they?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.300
Of course.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.333
She wants to live.

07:17.367 --> 07:19.367
On this, she's very clear.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.170
So am I.

07:25.533 --> 07:27.533
MARI: People should listen
to reason.

07:27.567 --> 07:30.597
Suddenly every patient and their
wife thinks they're a doctor.

07:30.633 --> 07:32.373
I blame Google.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.570
Sometimes it takes a little
while for reality to sink in.

07:35.600 --> 07:40.230
Well, let's hope it doesn't take
too long, for everyone's sake.

07:40.267 --> 07:42.267
Is everything all right?

07:42.300 --> 07:43.730
Of course. Why?

07:43.767 --> 07:46.697
It's usually me getting
irritated by the patients.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.233
(Mari sniffs)

07:48.267 --> 07:50.267
My apologies, Dr Fonseca.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.500
It must be the heat
beginning to get to me.

08:13.733 --> 08:15.673
(Engine revs)

08:34.567 --> 08:36.496
(Horn toots)

08:44.633 --> 08:46.603
(Children clamouring
and laughing)

08:46.633 --> 08:48.403
OK, hello.

08:48.433 --> 08:50.173
Oi! Hey, give that back!

08:50.200 --> 08:52.130
(Clamouring)

08:52.733 --> 08:54.673
Give me that!

08:54.700 --> 08:56.130
- (Horn beeps)
- Don't touch that.

08:56.167 --> 08:58.067
(Speaks Malayalam)
Jasprit Mathew?

09:00.733 --> 09:02.733
You. You strong?

09:02.767 --> 09:06.527
Show me your muscles. OK.
100 rupees, yeah?

09:06.567 --> 09:08.267
Get all these kids off my bike

09:08.300 --> 09:10.270
and you'll get another 100
when I'm back.

09:17.233 --> 09:18.573
Good work.

09:20.633 --> 09:22.273
Let me know where it hurts.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.700
OK.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.433
How's that?

09:32.233 --> 09:34.273
You need to let me know
where it hurts.

09:35.433 --> 09:37.273
Is it hurting?

09:37.300 --> 09:39.670
Just a little.
It's really not too bad.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.300
See? The boy's fine.

09:42.333 --> 09:45.403
Your son's heart is racing
and he has a temperature.

09:45.433 --> 09:48.103
Then treat him and let him
get back to his work.

09:48.133 --> 09:51.303
The crops must come in today.
They're dying in this heat.

09:51.333 --> 09:54.073
Your son has appendicitis.
It could already be ruptured.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.230
I need to get him to hospital
as soon as possible.

09:56.267 --> 09:57.727
Enough of this now.

09:57.767 --> 10:01.067
You've seen the doctor, now stop
the nonsense and get up!

10:01.100 --> 10:03.200
Don't touch him.
He's sick. He's sick!

10:04.333 --> 10:05.803
Look, I need to treat your son.

10:05.833 --> 10:08.733
He needs antibiotics into his
veins, maybe even surgery,

10:08.767 --> 10:10.627
so he needs to get
to hospital fast!

10:10.667 --> 10:12.667
What are you?

10:12.700 --> 10:14.430
A girl of 15 or 16?

10:14.467 --> 10:15.627
How dare you defy me!

10:15.667 --> 10:19.027
Now get out of my house
or you'll get a taste of this!

10:19.067 --> 10:20.027
Papa.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.730
I'm not going anywhere.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.330
I need an ambulance to the
Mathew Farm immediately.

10:30.367 --> 10:33.227
I've got a septic patient
with acute appendicitis.

10:35.433 --> 10:37.373
Well, where the hell is AJ?

10:38.700 --> 10:40.100
Not again?

10:40.133 --> 10:43.133
Speeding? Third offence?
For God's sake, AJ.

10:44.233 --> 10:46.133
Dad, she hates me, OK?

10:46.167 --> 10:47.767
I dated her once.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.030
She just wants a bribe.
Then we can forget about it.

10:52.567 --> 10:53.597
Huh?

10:56.200 --> 10:57.630
Officer.

11:00.767 --> 11:02.727
- My son apologises.
- Uh-huh?

11:02.767 --> 11:05.497
I will drive him home.
You can keep the licence.

11:05.533 --> 11:07.473
Just give me the keys.

11:09.567 --> 11:11.497
Thank you.

11:15.167 --> 11:17.097
Get out. Get out!

11:37.767 --> 11:40.167
Even I expected it to last
more than a morning.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.130
Hurry up and help.

11:44.067 --> 11:47.097
Patient. Stretcher, come.

11:47.133 --> 11:50.073
Acute abdominal pain.
Clearly inflamed appendix.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.100
One, two, three. Go.

11:52.133 --> 11:53.403
- Careful.
- Easy.

11:53.433 --> 11:54.833
OK.

11:54.867 --> 11:56.697
One, two, three. Lift.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.300
No.

12:08.633 --> 12:11.033
- But, Dad!
- Give me the ambulance keys!

12:11.067 --> 12:13.367
- OK, but... Fine.
- Thank you.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.270
Ranjit! Please come.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.330
Why call Ranjit?
He's nothing to do with this.

12:17.367 --> 12:19.697
You'll soon come to know.
Ranjit, congratulations.

12:19.733 --> 12:21.473
You are our new
ambulance driver.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.630
AJ: Ridiculous!
What am I supposed to do now?

12:23.667 --> 12:26.567
My, what are you supposed to do?
I'll tell you what.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.400
You are supposed to do this.

12:28.433 --> 12:30.033
You're gonna make me an orderly?

12:30.067 --> 12:32.167
That's right.
Report to Sister Mari.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.530
When she says, "Jump,"
you'll ask how bloody high.

12:34.567 --> 12:36.567
OK. Fine. Dr Fonseca,
Come on, please.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.300
Sorry, this is out of my hands.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.633
But I have to say it does seem
an excellent idea.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.497
In fact, I'm rather ashamed
I didn't think of it myself.

12:44.467 --> 12:45.467
Fine.

13:01.367 --> 13:02.727
The pain seems better.

13:02.767 --> 13:05.497
He's had morphine
and a litre of saline.

13:05.533 --> 13:08.803
And his belly is soft.

13:08.833 --> 13:12.133
It's probably just
mesenteric adenitis.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.427
Your son has
a mild viral infection.

13:14.467 --> 13:16.697
It has affected the lymph nodes
in his belly.

13:16.733 --> 13:19.703
But er...he should make
a full recovery.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.803
Finally,
a real doctor has seen him.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.033
I don't agree.

13:23.067 --> 13:26.027
When I examined him, he had
all the signs of appendicitis -

13:26.067 --> 13:28.097
- fever, pain...
- Quiet!

13:28.133 --> 13:30.003
The doctor has seen him now.

13:31.067 --> 13:32.997
Er...Dr Walker?

13:39.467 --> 13:41.827
- You asked me for my opinion.
- No, I asked for help.

13:41.867 --> 13:44.627
From an experienced colleague.
If you wish to ignore me...

13:44.667 --> 13:46.227
It could still be an appendix.

13:46.267 --> 13:48.167
The morphine I gave
could mask the pain.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.630
- Highly unlikely.
- But possible.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.497
- If you're wrong, he could die.
- I know.

13:51.533 --> 13:54.303
That is the kind of decision
a surgeon makes every day.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.673
Now, if you don't feel you can
handle that kind of pressure...

13:58.400 --> 13:59.770
What?

13:59.800 --> 14:01.730
OK, let's ask Lydia.

14:06.067 --> 14:07.797
I agree with Dr Varma.

14:07.833 --> 14:10.673
It's probably
just mesenteric adenitis.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.630
But we can't take any chances.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.097
Not when you live 20 miles
past the back of beyond.

14:15.133 --> 14:16.433
The appendix comes out today.

14:20.233 --> 14:23.673
In fact, it's a perfect teaching
case for Dr Walker.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.800
It's about time you tried
your hand at surgery.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.373
And I'm sure
you'll be delighted to assist.

14:43.367 --> 14:46.697
It's just a consent form to say
that you agree to us operating.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.370
If you like,
I can read it out for you?

14:52.400 --> 14:54.170
Well...

14:54.200 --> 14:57.300
Thank you for the offer,
but I can read.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.833
I just like to know what it is
that I'm signing.

14:59.867 --> 15:02.667
I'm sorry. Of course.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.530
I think you are blushing.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.400
Or maybe it is just the heat?

15:08.433 --> 15:11.033
Definitely blushing.
Of course you can read.

15:14.167 --> 15:15.667
This is your first operation?

15:18.467 --> 15:21.727
Not only can I read and write,
but I've fully-functional ears.

15:23.167 --> 15:25.167
I'm going to be
fully supervised.

15:25.200 --> 15:29.070
Dr Varma is
an excellent surgeon.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.730
Then I'm in two pairs
of safe hands.

15:49.633 --> 15:51.573
(Monitor beeping)

15:57.367 --> 15:58.997
GABRIEL: Are we ready?

16:02.300 --> 16:05.100
Knife, please, Sister. No.

16:05.133 --> 16:07.073
Dr Walker is our surgeon today.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.700
Bolder.

16:19.733 --> 16:21.433
There's no room for doubt.

16:21.467 --> 16:23.597
If you can't trust
your own judgment,

16:23.633 --> 16:25.803
how can you ask
the patient to trust you?

16:37.300 --> 16:39.000
Swab, please.

16:45.567 --> 16:47.497
GABRIEL: Retractors.

16:48.733 --> 16:51.473
Now lift the peritoneum.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.670
Make the incision with
the Metzenbaum scissors.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.430
I'm through. Now what?

16:57.467 --> 16:59.697
Identify the inevitably
normal appendix

16:59.733 --> 17:03.603
at the base of the caecum,
then deliver it into the wound.

17:03.633 --> 17:05.403
And you're sure
it's going to be normal?

17:05.433 --> 17:07.403
- Absolutely.
- Because you're always right?

17:07.433 --> 17:09.733
Because I trust my own judgment.
Deeper.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.767
Feel for the bowel wall.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.630
LYDIA: Clearly I'm just in time
for the main event.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.666
Carry on, Dr Walker.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.630
(Vacuum pump hisses)

17:26.532 --> 17:29.703
Acutely inflamed. In fact,
on the verge of perforation.

17:29.733 --> 17:32.533
So I'd say Dr Walker
has won this little battle.

17:32.567 --> 17:34.667
When you're finished,
send it to the lab.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.300
- I'll prescribe antibiotics.
- No problem.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.273
Dr Nair could use a hand
in the incontinence clinic?

17:40.300 --> 17:43.330
Dr Walker seems to have
everything under control here.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.800
(Laughter)

17:48.567 --> 17:50.467
MARI: AJ?

17:50.500 --> 17:51.730
AJ?

17:53.067 --> 17:54.397
AJ.

17:57.167 --> 17:59.697
AJ!

17:59.733 --> 18:02.273
Someone has vomited in
Outpatients. Twice.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.700
Poor Dr Varma.

18:12.733 --> 18:15.473
I simply assumed
he'd been sucking lemons again.

18:15.500 --> 18:16.800
He'll get over it.

18:16.833 --> 18:19.303
Regular humiliation does him
the world of good.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.473
Yeah.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.230
Erm...can I ask you a question,
Lydia?

18:25.267 --> 18:27.197
Yeah. Of course.

18:36.267 --> 18:38.267
Much as I value
your friendship...

18:38.300 --> 18:41.030
- No!
- (Chuckles)

18:41.067 --> 18:43.397
It is for Mala!

18:43.433 --> 18:47.273
I think it's beautiful.
As is she.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.300
- Do you think she'll accept?
- Only one way to find out.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.603
Gonna ask her tonight?

18:52.633 --> 18:55.273
Tonight?
Do you think I should?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.370
There's only one cure
for cold feet.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.800
Hold them to the fire.

19:06.333 --> 19:09.573
Hey. Thanks for helping me.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.630
It was...fun,
if that's the right word?

19:15.367 --> 19:17.097
You're on call tonight, yes?

19:17.133 --> 19:19.133
First night in charge
on your own.

19:19.167 --> 19:21.697
Mm. For my sins.

19:21.733 --> 19:24.033
I have some patients
you need to review.

19:24.067 --> 19:25.997
Sure. No problem.

19:28.533 --> 19:29.833
Got plans?

19:29.867 --> 19:32.427
Actually...I have a date.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.730
LYDIA: The only thing a doctor
likes better than being right

19:37.767 --> 19:39.767
is proving
another doctor wrong.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.500
I don't think Dr Varma
sees it that way.

19:41.533 --> 19:44.033
Sometimes it's hard being
a man in a woman's world.

19:44.067 --> 19:48.267
The truth is, being born with
a penis is a huge disadvantage.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.470
There she is,
the oldest woman in India.

19:51.833 --> 19:53.733
Probably.

19:53.767 --> 19:56.527
Her daughter won't let her go.

19:56.567 --> 19:59.467
- What do you want me to do?
- Her kidneys are failing.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.500
So more fluids if her pressure
drops, nothing more.

20:02.533 --> 20:05.573
If the good Lord wants her,
we shouldn't stand in her way.

20:05.600 --> 20:09.670
Right. I better go home and see
what devastation awaits.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.800
Apparently, my supper's on
the table. Something special.

20:12.833 --> 20:13.933
Have fun.

20:13.967 --> 20:17.027
I'll try, but expect
I'll have to have sex first.

20:17.067 --> 20:19.327
A woman's work.
Call me if you need me.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.127
Of course.

20:21.167 --> 20:23.427
My ship is in your hands
tonight.

20:23.467 --> 20:25.397
Keep her from the rocks, please.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.603
(Motorcycle engine revs)

20:38.267 --> 20:40.197
Hey. How are you feeling?

20:41.300 --> 20:43.230
Better. Thank you.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.170
Very neat.
Not bad for a first effort.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.830
David Copperfield?

20:50.867 --> 20:53.427
Yeah. Have you read it?

20:53.467 --> 20:55.597
Honestly, Dickens pretty much
passed me by.

20:55.633 --> 20:57.103
I'm mostly medical books.

20:58.333 --> 21:00.803
My appendix
is grateful for that.

21:00.833 --> 21:04.103
- You like to read?
- Always.

21:04.133 --> 21:07.033
To be honest,
I'm not much of a farmer.

21:07.067 --> 21:08.797
That was always
my father's life.

21:10.633 --> 21:12.633
He seems very angry.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.597
Only when he is awake.

21:16.267 --> 21:18.767
He is a good person, really.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.670
He just likes to have
his own way.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.270
If I'd listened to him,
we might not be talking.

21:26.867 --> 21:29.167
He will want us
to leave tomorrow.

21:29.200 --> 21:33.070
You're my patient, which means
you leave when I say so.

21:33.100 --> 21:34.700
Nothing intimidates you,
does it?

21:34.733 --> 21:36.733
It's an act.

21:36.767 --> 21:38.697
Don't tell anyone.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.270
So does it have a happy ending?

21:45.067 --> 21:46.567
When I finish,
I will let you know.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.000
Gin and tonic?

22:17.867 --> 22:21.267
Believe it or not, it's not the
first time I've co-habited.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.130
Do I want to hear this?

22:23.167 --> 22:25.567
Picture a one-bedroom flat
in Stourbridge.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.130
I was 19.

22:28.167 --> 22:29.697
Wendy worked at the brewery.

22:29.733 --> 22:31.733
Free samples.

22:31.767 --> 22:34.497
Very adventurous girl.

22:34.533 --> 22:36.533
Truly, I was living the dream.

22:36.567 --> 22:38.497
I really don't want
to hear this.

22:38.533 --> 22:41.203
It all started with
a single pink toothbrush.

22:41.233 --> 22:44.533
One day it just appeared in the
half-pint pot by the wash basin.

22:44.567 --> 22:49.327
I raised the issue and was told
it was merely convenience.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.327
But it didn't stop there.

22:51.367 --> 22:53.367
Next came spare underwear...

22:53.400 --> 22:55.030
a bathrobe.

22:55.067 --> 22:57.767
Then one day I opened
the wardrobe and it hit me.

22:57.800 --> 22:58.800
What?

22:58.833 --> 23:00.633
Seven pairs of shoes, a foot spa

23:00.667 --> 23:03.127
and the fact that I was
in a serious relationship.

23:03.167 --> 23:06.027
(Laughs) What did you do?

23:06.067 --> 23:08.727
I did what any 19-year-old
would do in that situation.

23:08.767 --> 23:11.227
I treated her appallingly
until she left me.

23:11.267 --> 23:13.327
Forgive me for not being
surprised.

23:13.367 --> 23:15.067
I was young and foolish.

23:15.100 --> 23:17.100
Good thing you've changed then,
eh?

23:20.067 --> 23:21.467
I mean, look.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.370
It's perfect.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.330
Enough to make
anyone fall in love.

23:26.467 --> 23:27.797
There's a lot of it about.

23:27.833 --> 23:31.573
An engagement ring's burning a
hole in Ram's pocket as I speak.

23:33.567 --> 23:34.697
Is that a hint?

23:35.567 --> 23:37.467
What? God, no!

23:41.833 --> 23:44.273
- Were you being serious?
- Of course not.

23:44.300 --> 23:46.230
Here, I'll get your dessert.

23:48.233 --> 23:49.633
Thank you.

23:57.167 --> 23:59.097
(Insects trilling)

24:09.067 --> 24:10.997
(Greg hums to himself)

24:16.600 --> 24:18.530
(Rumble of thunder)

24:23.667 --> 24:25.597
(Cutlery clattering in kitchen)

24:30.100 --> 24:31.470
AJ: Is he OK?

24:31.500 --> 24:33.670
He has a fever.
His pulse is too high.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.130
I need you to go
and get more fluids.

24:37.167 --> 24:39.427
Mari said we're
down to the last three bags.

24:39.467 --> 24:41.527
Which my patient needs. Now.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.197
OK.

24:45.700 --> 24:48.400
So, Doctor, now that you've
cured him, can he leave?

24:48.433 --> 24:50.633
Your son has just had
a major operation

24:50.667 --> 24:52.827
and the infection
spread to his belly.

24:52.867 --> 24:55.697
- He needs antibiotics and time.
- Maybe some other doctor?

24:55.733 --> 24:57.333
- I'm not...
- If he's not well...

24:57.367 --> 24:59.497
Tonight I am the senior doctor
in this hospital.

24:59.533 --> 25:01.603
Which means
my decision is final.

25:19.533 --> 25:21.473
(Woman sobbing)

25:27.733 --> 25:29.203
Mari?

25:29.233 --> 25:30.733
(Mari sobs)

25:30.767 --> 25:33.797
I'm so sorry, Doctor.
This is totally unprofessional.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.103
Sorry.

25:36.133 --> 25:37.773
Are you OK?

25:39.467 --> 25:42.127
I thought it was just
a squabble.

25:42.167 --> 25:44.427
And then this morning
I got this.

25:47.067 --> 25:50.627
Apparently er...
he's found someone else...

25:52.833 --> 25:54.773
..who can provide what I can't.

25:58.133 --> 26:00.333
I'm sorry. Really.

26:00.367 --> 26:03.367
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.830
No, no.

26:04.867 --> 26:07.727
It's me who should apologise.

26:07.767 --> 26:11.227
This is totally irresponsible to
bring personal problems to work.

26:11.267 --> 26:13.267
I will not do it again.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.730
- Mere self-indulgence. No.
- Mari, wait.

26:15.767 --> 26:17.567
I don't mind talking. Wait.

26:17.600 --> 26:20.270
(Electricity fizzes,
machinery powers down)

26:25.267 --> 26:27.627
MARI: We need to start
the backup generator.

26:28.833 --> 26:30.773
(Thunder rumbles)

26:37.767 --> 26:39.297
You know how to use this?

26:39.333 --> 26:43.133
Of course, Doctor. This is not
the first time. Hold this.

26:43.167 --> 26:45.597
- Fuel connected?
- Yes. Glow plugs...

26:45.633 --> 26:47.473
(Generator powers up)

26:51.867 --> 26:53.767
(Generator powers down)

26:56.433 --> 26:58.203
That's not good.

27:01.267 --> 27:03.667
AJ's checking to see
if the street lights are out.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.730
It could be down across
the whole state.

27:05.767 --> 27:07.067
It's totally dead.

27:07.100 --> 27:09.470
If there's no power,
nothing will work.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.700
Even the mobiles need power
to the masts.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.100
What do you want to do?

27:15.133 --> 27:17.503
(Match strikes)

27:17.533 --> 27:21.103
OK, let's get as many patients
as possible to the female ward.

27:21.133 --> 27:22.573
That way we can
keep an eye on them.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.230
More torches, more candles,
whatever you can find.

27:25.267 --> 27:27.827
- And then send AJ for help.
- In this?

27:27.867 --> 27:29.267
We don't have a choice.

27:30.267 --> 27:31.797
Yes, Doctor.

27:31.833 --> 27:33.633
Ruby, I need you now. Come on.

27:35.100 --> 27:37.030
(Agitated chatter)

27:41.367 --> 27:43.127
We can't get a blood pressure.

27:45.233 --> 27:48.133
- How long has he been in pain?
- An hour, maybe more.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.797
MARI: His pulse is weaker.

27:49.833 --> 27:52.373
He's tachycardic and
his temperature is up.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.200
What do you want to do?

27:56.233 --> 27:59.473
What's wrong, Doctor? I thought
the procedure went well.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.770
I thought so.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.530
Maybe I didn't close him up
properly.

28:03.567 --> 28:07.127
If I made a mistake, he could be
bleeding at the operation site.

28:07.167 --> 28:09.467
But Dr Varma was there with you.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.400
We need to take him back
to theatre.

28:11.433 --> 28:13.133
We can't without power.

28:13.167 --> 28:15.097
If he's bleeding, it won't stop.

28:15.133 --> 28:18.273
- I have to go in and check.
- Dr Walker, that is impossible!

28:18.300 --> 28:20.500
We either operate now
or we watch him die.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.270
(Thunder rumbles)

28:29.733 --> 28:31.673
(Manual vacuum pump)

28:36.267 --> 28:37.997
- Doctor?
- OK.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.270
OK, turn it on.

28:54.633 --> 28:56.503
MARI: Are you ready?

28:59.200 --> 29:00.800
Ruby?

29:02.767 --> 29:04.697
- Yeah. Let's get on with it.
- OK.

29:13.267 --> 29:15.197
(Thunder crashes)

29:23.333 --> 29:25.273
(Rain patters)

29:33.433 --> 29:35.373
AJ: It's going down.

29:44.367 --> 29:45.527
RUBY: Shit.

29:48.467 --> 29:50.397
MARI: Doctor, what's wrong?

29:51.367 --> 29:52.467
Ruby?

29:52.500 --> 29:54.170
Nothing.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.130
Nothing's wrong.

29:57.300 --> 29:59.130
No bleeding, no leak.

30:01.667 --> 30:03.367
LYDIA:
What the hell are you doing?

30:03.400 --> 30:06.100
I didn't believe them
when they said you were in here.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.597
Step away, Dr Walker.

30:12.067 --> 30:14.197
We need to wash out
and close up immediately.

30:14.233 --> 30:15.533
Yes, Doctor.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.400
LYDIA: I just want to know why.

30:27.433 --> 30:29.303
I thought it was
the right decision.

30:29.333 --> 30:32.033
To try and operate
during a blackout?

30:32.067 --> 30:34.327
It could have been
a failed anastomosis.

30:34.367 --> 30:36.427
He could have been bleeding out.

30:36.467 --> 30:38.467
And was he?

30:38.500 --> 30:40.300
No.

30:40.333 --> 30:42.833
There's a fine line between
confidence and arrogance.

30:42.867 --> 30:45.367
Let's hope this boy
doesn't pay the price.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.400
Ah, perfect timing.

30:47.433 --> 30:49.433
I need you to take over here.

30:49.467 --> 30:52.497
Check for possible septic shock
post repeat surgery.

30:52.533 --> 30:55.633
She brought him back here alone
so I've created a monster.

30:55.667 --> 30:59.127
Carry on with manual ventilation
till the power comes back on.

30:59.167 --> 31:00.497
Of course.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.500
Doctor?

31:18.867 --> 31:20.797
(Thunder rumbles)

31:22.433 --> 31:24.333
Your son's very sick.

31:24.367 --> 31:26.497
We're doing everything we can
to help him.

31:37.867 --> 31:39.827
Every day he works.

31:39.867 --> 31:41.797
Hours and hours.

31:43.867 --> 31:47.127
He's all I have...

31:47.167 --> 31:49.627
..the only thing in my life
that is worth anything.

31:54.233 --> 31:56.173
I need to talk to him.

31:58.433 --> 32:00.373
The boy's a dreamer, you know?

32:02.267 --> 32:05.197
Head always in the clouds,
or in one of his damn books.

32:08.667 --> 32:10.597
He needed discipline.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.230
I love my son.

32:17.533 --> 32:19.733
I must make sure he knows that.

32:24.567 --> 32:26.067
Follow me.

32:36.633 --> 32:38.573
(Ruby clears her throat)

32:41.100 --> 32:42.730
My patient.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.730
Lydia asked me to take charge.

32:47.367 --> 32:48.797
I know.

33:14.100 --> 33:16.030
I'm afraid it won't be
much longer now.

33:18.067 --> 33:20.497
The time, please?
What is the time?

33:20.533 --> 33:23.403
Almost 4am.

33:23.433 --> 33:27.103
It's too soon. We must continue.
Please, Doctor.

33:27.133 --> 33:30.403
I'm so sorry. There's really
not much more we can do.

33:35.167 --> 33:36.997
(Speaks in Malayalam)

33:41.500 --> 33:43.200
She hears me.

33:43.833 --> 33:45.373
She understands.

33:50.133 --> 33:52.073
(Pump hisses)

33:56.233 --> 33:58.233
Your own father
must be very proud of you.

33:59.233 --> 34:01.173
A doctor so young.

34:03.733 --> 34:05.673
My father left
when I was a baby.

34:07.300 --> 34:09.300
He must have been weak.

34:09.333 --> 34:11.833
Or perhaps...mentally deficient.

34:11.867 --> 34:14.027
(Ruby chuckles)

34:14.067 --> 34:17.627
I think Mum just thought he was
a selfish, self-centred bastard.

34:17.667 --> 34:19.597
I don't even know
if he's dead or alive.

34:21.500 --> 34:23.500
So this is why you came here?

34:23.533 --> 34:25.473
To look for your father?

34:27.266 --> 34:28.597
No.

34:28.632 --> 34:30.572
I came here to...

34:33.467 --> 34:35.467
I don't know why I came here.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.600
I wasn't happy in England,
I know that.

34:41.167 --> 34:43.097
Only a fool wants to be happy.

34:46.367 --> 34:49.097
And you are nobody's fool...
I think.

34:56.699 --> 34:58.700
Oh, finally.
We'll put him on the machine.

34:58.733 --> 35:00.733
(Monitor bleeps)

35:00.767 --> 35:02.427
Hold this.

35:19.333 --> 35:21.173
(Bell tinkles)

35:24.667 --> 35:25.997
GABRIEL: Coffee?

35:26.833 --> 35:28.403
Thanks.

35:28.433 --> 35:29.803
(Gabriel exhales)

35:29.833 --> 35:31.833
How is he?

35:31.867 --> 35:33.797
Yeah, better.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.533
Good.

35:38.533 --> 35:40.473
(Birdsong)

35:43.533 --> 35:45.473
What would you have done?

35:51.233 --> 35:53.173
I don't know.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.427
I'm sorry.

36:13.067 --> 36:15.197
The time of death,
Doctor, please?

36:15.233 --> 36:17.573
Your mother passed away
at 6:10 this morning.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.530
(Sighs)

36:20.800 --> 36:22.800
You will record this?

36:22.833 --> 36:24.773
That's the procedure, yes.

36:26.233 --> 36:28.733
This is fine. She's done it.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.200
Can I get the spanner?

36:41.233 --> 36:43.173
- Ten mil.
- Yes. Yes.

36:47.667 --> 36:49.127
Here.

36:51.533 --> 36:54.473
So this means you are speaking
to your father again?

36:54.500 --> 36:56.430
I think I just did.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.633
You did well last night.

37:01.067 --> 37:03.067
Even Mari said so.

37:03.100 --> 37:04.700
And she's a harsh mistress.

37:05.533 --> 37:06.703
(Sighs)

37:06.733 --> 37:09.073
The piston's completely
seized up.

37:09.100 --> 37:11.030
- It's no good.
- (Clattering)

37:25.233 --> 37:27.173
For God's sake,
say something, AJ.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.330
When do you plan on asking her?

37:34.733 --> 37:36.733
When the time is right.

37:36.767 --> 37:40.127
You know these things, they...
they need the right moment.

37:44.233 --> 37:47.233
You've got to grow up, AJ.

37:47.267 --> 37:50.527
But your father needs to...
let you.

37:52.433 --> 37:55.673
This is the first step
for you and for me.

37:58.367 --> 37:59.727
Well?

38:05.800 --> 38:07.730
Congratulations.

38:08.867 --> 38:10.797
- My boy!
- Ooh!

38:12.867 --> 38:15.027
Can I have my old job back?

38:15.067 --> 38:16.167
Not a chance.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.800
- Good morning.
- How are you feeling?

38:22.833 --> 38:25.373
The boy has the strength
of youth.

38:25.400 --> 38:29.670
One minute they are at death's
door, the next, ready for work.

38:29.700 --> 38:32.270
Well, I think a period of
recuperation is necessary.

38:32.300 --> 38:35.530
Give someone a taste of an idle
life, you've lost them forever.

38:39.267 --> 38:41.197
OK. One day.

38:42.333 --> 38:44.333
Not a minute more!

38:44.367 --> 38:47.297
Mr Matthews, can I just...

38:47.333 --> 38:51.073
I gave you what you asked for,
a chance to speak to him.

38:51.100 --> 38:53.600
Well, I'm quite grateful
for that.

38:53.633 --> 38:55.633
So tell him what you told me.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.697
What?

38:58.133 --> 39:00.433
I am old.
I keep forgetting things.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.830
Tell him that you love him.

39:04.867 --> 39:07.097
Every father loves
their children.

39:07.133 --> 39:09.573
Nobody needs to shout it
from the rooftops.

39:11.433 --> 39:14.773
You will find him one day and
he will tell you this himself.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.070
Can I help you?

39:35.400 --> 39:37.770
It's OK, Doctor.
This is Mr Shafeez.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.500
He's my accountant.

39:40.533 --> 39:43.303
Which doesn't explain why he's
looking at my hospital notes.

39:43.333 --> 39:45.073
This is Shweta,
my granddaughter.

39:45.100 --> 39:47.470
She wishes to go to university.

39:47.500 --> 39:51.630
Ten years ago, my mother placed
a wager with Mr Shafeez,

39:51.667 --> 39:54.667
that she would live
until she was 100 years old.

39:54.700 --> 39:56.530
The odds were high enough

39:56.567 --> 39:59.627
to give her great-granddaughter
an education.

39:59.667 --> 40:03.727
My mother was born at 6:03
on this day, in 1918.

40:05.133 --> 40:07.503
Can you confirm
the exact time of death?

40:07.533 --> 40:09.833
I can.

40:09.867 --> 40:12.127
Thank you for all you've done
for my family.

40:21.433 --> 40:24.773
Ah, Dr Walker! There's
a reporter here to see you.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.530
Someone told them about your
torchlight heroics last night

40:27.567 --> 40:29.127
and they want an interview.

40:29.167 --> 40:31.267
I shouldn't have taken him back.
You know that.

40:31.300 --> 40:33.500
Never let the truth get in
the way of a good story.

40:33.533 --> 40:36.773
Especially if the publicity
helps us get a new generator.

40:36.800 --> 40:40.070
He's outside. Flirt a little.
I have a house call to make.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.130
PHOTOGRAPHER: Go on, smile.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.430
PHOTOGRAPHER: Go on, smile.

41:08.867 --> 41:10.767
I hope they got your good side.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.800
It wasn't my idea.
Lydia insisted.

41:12.833 --> 41:14.373
Of course.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.230
One of her core skills.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.570
So...you finally lost
your virginity.

41:22.367 --> 41:24.367
Your first solo operation.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.100
That makes you a real surgeon.

41:27.133 --> 41:30.033
An unnecessary one
that almost killed my patient.

41:30.067 --> 41:33.297
You were alone and you made
the call. That's what matters.

41:33.333 --> 41:35.073
Maybe.

41:38.300 --> 41:39.400
Definitely.

41:40.833 --> 41:44.733
Also, you were right
and I was wrong.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.170
Wow.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.730
Can I have that in writing?

41:50.767 --> 41:52.397
(Gabriel chuckles)

42:00.733 --> 42:02.673
(Engine fails to start)

42:06.600 --> 42:08.700
Can I have a jump start?

42:08.733 --> 42:11.233
- I can't hear you.
- Can I have a jump start?

42:11.267 --> 42:13.397
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you!
- Wait!

42:29.833 --> 42:31.273
LYDIA: Hi.

42:34.300 --> 42:36.300
Can I see some ID, please?

42:36.333 --> 42:38.333
Thank you for dinner last night.

42:38.367 --> 42:41.697
- Shame you missed dessert.
- I'm not an easy person.

42:41.733 --> 42:43.733
I know.

42:43.767 --> 42:45.827
It's a significant part
of your charm.

42:45.867 --> 42:47.597
You could do better.

42:48.667 --> 42:50.767
Well...not better, obviously.

42:52.100 --> 42:53.430
Simpler.

42:53.467 --> 42:55.467
I know that too.

42:55.500 --> 42:59.070
I don't want to be a pink
toothbrush in a half-pint pot.

43:02.433 --> 43:05.373
Christ, what do you have to do
to get a bloody pint round here?

43:06.800 --> 43:10.370
Well, well, well!

43:10.400 --> 43:12.400
You need your wallet
for a start!

43:12.433 --> 43:14.433
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

43:14.467 --> 43:15.827
Pint of Sadlers?

43:15.867 --> 43:17.527
(Laughs) Paul!

43:17.567 --> 43:19.567
- Dr Fonseca.
- Hello, Paul.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.470
GREG: What are you doing here?

43:21.500 --> 43:24.000
PAUL: Love what you've done
with the place.

43:26.700 --> 43:28.800
MARI: I'm really not sure
about this.

43:28.833 --> 43:30.773
Just give it a go, OK?

43:34.667 --> 43:37.027
Good? Good. All right.

43:38.467 --> 43:39.627
OK?

43:39.667 --> 43:41.427
Just start steady, yeah?

43:41.467 --> 43:43.397
Left. Then right, OK?

43:48.700 --> 43:50.630
Good. Harder.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.430
That's his stupid face
right there, yeah?

43:55.467 --> 43:57.067
Get it.

43:58.067 --> 43:59.467
Come on.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.500
A bit more. Harder.

44:01.533 --> 44:04.673
That's it. That's it.
Stupid bloody face.

44:04.700 --> 44:06.200
That's better.

44:07.300 --> 44:08.300
(Sobs)

44:22.833 --> 44:24.773
- Good?
- Thank you.

44:27.433 --> 44:29.433
Do you want to stop?

44:29.467 --> 44:30.997
No.

44:32.333 --> 44:34.273
All right.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.370
(Birdsong)

44:48.800 --> 44:50.730
(Bicycle bell tings)

45:14.767 --> 45:16.397
Your tea, sir.

45:16.433 --> 45:18.303
Thank you.
