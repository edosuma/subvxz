00:14.200 --> 00:17.510
Terrorists are controlling
the main terminal of Ontario Airport.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.672
Today your president and
the president of Russia have come together

00:20.760 --> 00:23.638
to sign an anti-terrorism alliance.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.438
I have hostages.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.353
<i>Unless President Logan
and President Suvarov</i>

00:28.440 --> 00:33.036
<i>make a joint statement repudiating
this accord, I will order their execution.</i>

00:33.120 --> 00:35.714
I want this handled!
Do you understand?

00:35.800 --> 00:39.349
I don't care how you do it.
I don't care what it takes. Fix it!

00:39.440 --> 00:41.954
David Palmer called me last night.

00:42.040 --> 00:46.079
He said it was a matter
of national security.

00:46.160 --> 00:49.675
<i>I need to talk to you.
It's hardly a matter of national security.</i>

00:49.760 --> 00:51.113
- That's not what he said.
- Yes, it is.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.599
No, that is a trick.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.872
I know all phone conversations are recorded.

00:55.960 --> 00:59.999
- Where do they store those transcripts?
- Archive room down the hall.

01:00.080 --> 01:03.789
This is Bill Buchanan.
I'm hoping we can resolve this peacefully.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.553
I don't think you understand
how serious we are.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.146
If you try to
enter the terminal,

01:09.231 --> 01:11.758
you will spend the rest of
the day collecting body parts.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.831
Jack, I need you to quarterback this.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.514
I'm staring down on the main concourse.

01:16.600 --> 01:20.991
I've got six hostiles in explosive vests
with orders to detonate if we make a move.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.117
I got a woman, Diane Huxley,
says she has info for CTU.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.317
- Diane, what's going on?
- Derek is inside the terminal.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.072
You.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.275
No!

01:30.360 --> 01:33.397
Curtis, they're moving another hostage.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.232
Oh, my God. It's Derek.

01:35.320 --> 01:39.950
You have a problem at the terminal.
Jack Bauer's inside, providing recon for CTU.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.190
<i>Hold on one second.</i>

01:42.720 --> 01:44.119
Mr Bauer.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.033
Derek has five seconds left to live.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.111
Four...

01:49.200 --> 01:51.191
Beresch!

02:08.960 --> 02:11.713
We've been trying,
but we can't make contact with Jack.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.711
- Can you make a visual?
- Negative.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.712
- Maybe Jack went dark intentionally.
- Unlikely.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.713
- He was talking when he was cut off.
- We assume he's been captured or killed.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.109
We mount the assault without his help.

02:23.200 --> 02:27.034
<i>Without Jack directing our team,
success probability falls to less than 20%.</i>

02:27.640 --> 02:30.234
President Logan
will sign this treaty in an hour.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.198
If the terrorists remain,
they'll kill all the hostages.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.589
What do you want me to do, Bill?

02:36.040 --> 02:38.679
Work up an assault plan
that doesn't include Jack.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.638
I'll go back to the staging area
and coordinate from there.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.871
Get back to your stations.
Prepare to reconfigure.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.316
All teams, stand down.
We're working up a new mission profile.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.709
Copy that, All teams, stand down,

02:51.040 --> 02:53.508
Keep down. Keep your head down.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.630
Mr Bauer, what is CTU's assault plan?

03:11.920 --> 03:17.278
The boy means something to you, or you
wouldn't have given yourself up so easily.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.749
Tell me the plan.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.436
They're gonna storm the north
concourse doors on my command.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.715
I'm coordinating the operation from here.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.189
Is there anyone else inside?

03:33.120 --> 03:34.109
No.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.233
Get me the plans to the terminal.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.911
You've been a great help.
We'll keep the boy alive for now.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.195
Bring me another hostage.

03:50.840 --> 03:54.958
Anything you do in here today
will not stop that treaty from being signed.

03:55.040 --> 03:58.430
The US government does not negotiate
with terrorists. You know that.

03:58.520 --> 04:03.719
Your president is a weak man.
He'll back down once more blood is spilled.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.314
- On your feet!
- Not him.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.709
<i>- You, get up!
- No! Don't!</i>

04:16.040 --> 04:18.600
Please. Please, you don't have to do this.

04:19.680 --> 04:23.389
- Vlad.
- I can help you buy more time.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.629
Please!

04:26.080 --> 04:28.958
No! You don't have to do this now.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.956
On your knees!

04:37.120 --> 04:41.113
CTU was supposed to have raided the
terminal by now. Why haven't we heard?

04:41.200 --> 04:44.112
- Buchanan said they had a setback.
- What kind of setback?

04:44.200 --> 04:47.670
- They lost contact with Jack Bauer.
- Why? What happened to him?

04:47.760 --> 04:51.230
They're not sure, but they need
to reconfigure their assault plan.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.676
<i>- Beresch is back online.
- I'll tell the president.</i>

04:55.400 --> 04:58.790
Beresch is transmitting from the terminal.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.757
He's got another hostage.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.551
<i>We've waited patiently for you to renounce
this unholy pact with our oppressors.</i>

05:06.640 --> 05:09.029
<i>We have heard nothing.</i>

05:09.120 --> 05:11.588
This is the cost of that silence.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.596
What happens next
is your choice, Mr President.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.513
If you choose to sign this corrupt document,

05:25.600 --> 05:31.675
understand that you will also be staining it
with the blood of the remaining hostages.

05:36.160 --> 05:39.516
If CTU can't pull this off in time...

05:39.600 --> 05:42.398
That's upwards of 60 people, Mike.

05:42.480 --> 05:46.268
You know I've never done anything
I didn't feel was right for the country.

05:46.360 --> 05:50.148
Of course not, sir.
Nobody thinks otherwise.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.950
I know I'm ambitious and that I want this
treaty to be the hallmark of my presidency,

06:00.040 --> 06:03.237
but I never thought
I would sacrifice innocent life.

06:03.320 --> 06:07.757
Mr President, you are not responsible
for the actions of these murderers.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.717
- I could postpone this.
- Sir?

06:09.800 --> 06:12.155
I give them what they want, nobody else dies.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.118
Do you think these people
would release the hostages?

06:15.200 --> 06:21.275
We both know that'll never happen.
You're doing the only thing you can do.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.556
<i>The terrorists are calling the treaty
an "unholy pact"...</i>

06:30.640 --> 06:34.599
If someone altered the recording
of your conversation with David Palmer,

06:34.680 --> 06:37.672
- the president needs to know.
- No, not now. Not yet.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.959
- What are you waiting for?
- Charles is preoccupied.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.262
With the summit and
the hostage situation,

06:43.347 --> 06:45.795
he's not in the frame of
mind to deal with this.

06:45.880 --> 06:49.077
Besides, he thinks I'm unstable,

06:49.160 --> 06:51.879
which means I have to show it to him
in the right way.

06:51.960 --> 06:57.557
So, until the treaty's signed,
I'm not letting this out of my sight.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.429
- What's happening?
- Sorry, no time to explain.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.638
- You were going in to get the hostages.
- We lost contact with Jack.

07:11.720 --> 07:12.937
What does that mean?

07:12.980 --> 07:15.429
We're not sure, but we
need to change plans.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.192
- Is Jack OK?
- We don't know.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.158
- What about Derek?
- As soon as we know, you'll be told.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.710
- Please, l...
- Miss Huxley, I need to go.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.634
<i>The situation
continues to grow more tragic.</i>

07:32.720 --> 07:35.188
<i>We've just received a video feed confirming</i>

07:35.280 --> 07:39.592
<i>that another hostage has been executed
inside the main terminal at Ontario Airport,</i>

07:39.680 --> 07:41.671
- Jack...
- Don't say anything.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.389
We're gonna get through this.
Just don't say anything right now.

07:45.480 --> 07:49.359
<i>A White House spokesperson has
reiterated that President Logan will sign</i>

07:49.440 --> 07:52.830
<i>a historic pact with
his Russian counterpart as scheduled.</i>

07:52.920 --> 08:00.395
<i>It has, of course, been a long-standing
foreign policy not to yield to terrorists...</i>

08:04.360 --> 08:08.512
You're going to call CTU and tell them
you've revised your assault profile.

08:08.600 --> 08:13.310
Tell them to come to the emergency door
south of gate 12.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.630
They won't do that because I ask.
They'll need an explanation.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.915
That's your concern, Mr Bauer.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.272
Overwrite volume four
and re-key with the airport grid.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.351
- Just one second.
- We don't have a second.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.158
We're running out of time.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.549
- Want some help, Spenser?
- He doesn't need it.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.597
Keep managing the two-ways,
or else we'll have dropouts.

08:39.679 --> 08:43.719
- Excuse me. You're Miss O'Brian, right?
- Who are you?

08:43.799 --> 08:48.555
Lynn McGill, from District. I met you
at that memory-management lecture.

08:48.640 --> 08:52.519
- If you say so. What do you need?
- I need to talk to Bill Buchanan.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.751
He's in the situation room.
He's kinda busy right now.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.035
I see him. Thanks.

08:58.120 --> 09:02.113
Looking forward to working with you today.

09:02.200 --> 09:07.752
- You don't know who McGill is, do you?
- No, and I don't care. Get back to work.

09:17.400 --> 09:22.030
Once Curtis's teams go in there,
I want an update on the deployment of HIT.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.917
Hi.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.270
- Mr Buchanan, did they say I was coming?
- Lynn, please, call me Bill.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.955
If we were having a beer, but at work
a more formal mode of address is better.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.589
Whatever makes you feel comfortable.
We're in the middle of final prep.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.877
I understand President Logan
wants us to go in as soon as possible.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.748
- Yes, before the treaty's signed.
- Is Manning ready to send his teams in?

09:43.840 --> 09:45.637
He is, but we're flying blind.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.837
My briefing sheet says
we have Jack Bauer on the inside.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.195
We haven't heard from him for 20 minutes.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.475
That's interesting.

09:53.560 --> 09:58.236
I read the bulletin from Division,
but I don't know why you're here.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.959
- We were getting heat from the White House.
- About what?

10:01.040 --> 10:04.032
Jack Bauer. They wanna know
things are running smoothly.

10:04.120 --> 10:08.238
- We're on track, Lynn.
- I'm sure you are. That's my assignment.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.622
Is your tactical wired
through to all servers?

10:10.733 --> 10:12.816
Yes. You can plug
into station four.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.560
I'd prefer to work from your office,
Mr Buchanan.

10:15.640 --> 10:18.359
I think I should have
a central vantage point.

10:18.440 --> 10:23.230
I wanna make sure you're OK
working from another station.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.992
Fine.

10:25.080 --> 10:29.153
Good. And it's not a big deal, but just so
everyone's clear on the chain of command,

10:29.240 --> 10:32.630
I think you should address me
as Mr McGill in front of the others.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.790
You know, Lynn, I'd rather not.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.511
Just a suggestion.
Anyway, I need your office.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.830
<i>That's not a suggestion.</i>

10:41.920 --> 10:43.717
<i>- Fine.
- Mr Buchanan?</i>

10:43.800 --> 10:45.870
<i>It's Jack Bauer on line one.</i>

10:48.240 --> 10:52.074
- Is Curtis plugged into this call?
- I'm on, Bill. Put Jack through.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.913
<i>- You're both on with Jack Bauer.
- What happened?</i>

10:55.000 --> 10:59.232
One of the hostiles got too close.
I had to end the transmission.

10:59.320 --> 11:03.757
- All right, we'll restart the countdown.
- Negative. Scrap the existing plan.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.912
- Find a new breach point.
- My men are in position.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.232
They moved the hostages within the kill zone.
They'll be taken out with the crossfire.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.629
There's an emergency door south of gate 12.

11:13.720 --> 11:17.633
It's unguarded. You should be able
to punch through with no opposition.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.188
I see it,
but I'm not comfortable with this entry.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.475
It's the only shot we've got.

11:22.560 --> 11:25.233
- Are you there now?
- Yes, it's clear.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.598
I'm in a flank-two position.
I repeat: I am in a flank-two position.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.433
Curtis, how long before
your teams can redeploy?

11:32.520 --> 11:36.479
- About 20 minutes.
- The president's signing within 30 minutes.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.348
I'll go as fast as I can. Jack,
I'll call you when my men are in position.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.317
Copy that. I'll be standing by.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.230
Ivan and Ishmael, stay with the hostages.

11:51.320 --> 11:54.869
The rest of you, come here.
Vlad, guard them.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.031
You're doing great.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.828
- Manning.
- Buchanan.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.115
How long until your people can move in?

12:24.200 --> 12:26.270
- About 15 minutes.
- Why so long?

12:26.360 --> 12:30.114
When Jack changed breach point,
I modified everything, including explosives.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.758
They have to be repositioned.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.559
Is it a mistake to act on this?
It might take too long.

12:34.640 --> 12:38.679
Jack knows our deadline. If he didn't think
it was worth a delay, he wouldn't call.

12:38.760 --> 12:42.116
- I trust him.
- All right, Curtis, 15 minutes.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.077
You have to make this happen.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.116
- I will.
- Call when you're in position.

12:46.200 --> 12:50.034
Mr Buchanan,
Mr McGill needs to see you in his office.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.590
- lt'll have to wait. Tell him I'm busy.
- He said it had to be now.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.238
Fine.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.911
I'm settled in fine.
If I need anything, I'll call.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.072
What is it? I'm trying to coordinate
this hostage situation.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.038
- Sit down, Mr Buchanan.
- Stop with the "Mr Buchanan".

13:12.120 --> 13:14.509
We need to get this assault in motion now.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.591
Sit down, Bill.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.080
I told the White House
the rescue is back on track.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.878
Thank you.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.444
I found it a little
inappropriate talking about

13:28.529 --> 13:30.829
an operation I hadn't
personally reviewed,

13:30.920 --> 13:34.595
so before you send your men into
the terminal, I'd like to see the playbook.

13:34.680 --> 13:39.117
I can't have you micromanaging my work
here. If you wanna do my job, I'll go home.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.666
Please don't be defensive.
I'm not challenging you.

13:42.771 --> 13:44.796
I'm just trying to do my job.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.919
I'll have it sent to your laptop.
Anything else?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.036
That's all for now.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.994
Bill.

13:55.080 --> 14:01.553
Fighting me isn't gonna increase our chances
of saving those people's lives.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.199
Lynn wants to see the revised assault plan.

14:14.280 --> 14:17.989
- Is he running point instead of you?
- He just wants to see the plan.

14:18.080 --> 14:24.030
Bill. Curtis confirmed his team will be ready
in ten minutes, based on Jack's new intel.

14:24.120 --> 14:28.272
There is no word as to whether or not
the president will call off

14:28.360 --> 14:32.319
the signing of the historic treaty agreement
of the United States and Russia,

14:32.400 --> 14:35.710
scheduled for just under an hour,
The terrorists...

14:35.800 --> 14:38.678
Any response from the White House
since the last killing?

14:38.760 --> 14:43.117
They confirmed the signing of the treaty
is going ahead as planned.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.352
They won't capitulate as long as
they think their rescue attempt will succeed.

14:47.440 --> 14:52.753
Once we kill their men,
they'll realise their options have run out.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.994
The only chance these people had
of being rescued is gone because of me.

15:06.080 --> 15:10.835
People were gonna die here today.
That was their plan. This is not your fault.

15:10.920 --> 15:14.310
I'm the reason you went along with them.
If I wasn't here...

15:14.400 --> 15:16.391
Stop it.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.677
This is not over.

15:25.440 --> 15:28.352
<i>With no official rebuke
of the terrorists' demands,</i>

15:28.440 --> 15:32.513
<i>a statement from the White House confirmed
the president's position is unchanged</i>

15:32.600 --> 15:35.512
<i>and the treaty will be signed
within the hour as scheduled.</i>

15:35.600 --> 15:42.915
<i>It puts the lives of the 60 men, women and
children being held hostage in question...</i>

15:43.000 --> 15:46.834
Good news, sir. CTU has
re-established contact with Jack Bauer.

15:46.920 --> 15:50.117
The rescue operation is back on track.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.192
- But that's still no guarantee.
- Excuse me, sir?

15:53.280 --> 15:55.953
The hostages may be killed
when we go in there.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.237
Let's be honest, that's more likely than not.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.117
We don't know that, sir.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.670
- President Suvarov is waiting outside.
- He is?

16:05.760 --> 16:10.038
You're walking outside together onto
the stage. We all agreed to the protocol.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.714
- It's time already?
- Yes, sir.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.158
Mr President. Shall we?

16:22.680 --> 16:25.353
My people tell me
the assault has been delayed.

16:25.440 --> 16:29.592
It's happening now. It will happen
before the treaty is signed, don't worry.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.875
Mr President, like you,

16:31.960 --> 16:36.158
I have staked much of my political future
on the success of this treaty.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.390
If this rescue attempt fails,

16:38.480 --> 16:44.271
it will not only be rendered meaningless,
it will become a mockery.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.351
And so will we.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.637
I'm here to escort Mrs Logan.
The ceremony's beginning.

17:05.720 --> 17:09.713
- She'll be out in a moment.
- May l... have a word?

17:12.240 --> 17:16.118
You're aware Mrs Logan was found
in one of the archive rooms.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.270
I don't know anything about that.

17:18.359 --> 17:20.476
Aaron Pierce said you lied to him.

17:20.560 --> 17:24.678
You said Mrs Logan was in her room when
she was going through classified documents.

17:24.760 --> 17:28.548
I don't think you understand
how grave this situation is.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.313
- What do you mean?
- Mrs Logan removed a document

17:31.400 --> 17:34.631
that contains highly sensitive
intelligence protocols.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.599
- That's not what she said it was.
- What did she say she took?

17:38.680 --> 17:41.870
I think that you should
talk to her about this.

17:41.949 --> 17:45.218
This is important.
What did she tell you?

17:45.600 --> 17:49.593
She said it was a transcript
of a call she had with David Palmer.

17:49.680 --> 17:52.717
I'm sure when she said that she believed it.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.713
If this document finds its way into
the wrong hands, you'll be responsible.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.075
- I didn't take it.
- You aided and abetted.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.913
You'll not only lose your job,
you'll be prosecuted.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.072
That's not fair.
I tried to talk her out of this.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.790
All I'm asking is that you tell me...
where did she put it?

18:09.880 --> 18:12.235
She has it with her. It's in her blouse.

18:12.320 --> 18:17.633
She said she wouldn't let it out of her sight
until she talked to the president about it.

18:18.120 --> 18:21.317
Walt? Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm ready now.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.955
Presidents Logan and Suvarov
will each make statements,

18:37.040 --> 18:39.838
which will be followed
by the signing of the treaty.

18:39.920 --> 18:43.708
How much time will there be
between the moment I step out on stage

18:43.800 --> 18:46.314
- and when I sign the document?
- Not long.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.233
Does CTU know
that's how long they have for the rescue?

18:49.320 --> 18:53.518
Yes, sir. They're completely synchronised
with what's going on here.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.798
I hope so.
The lives of those hostages depend on it.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.672
Today was to be the crowning achievement
of my presidency.

19:02.760 --> 19:07.595
Instead everybody's waiting to hear
what's gonna happen at the airport.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.309
- So how are you feeling?
- I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.870
How come you just keep getting
better-looking as you get older?

19:17.960 --> 19:20.110
- I just keep getting older.
- What?

19:20.200 --> 19:24.910
You're the most beautiful First Lady
Pennsylvania Avenue has ever seen.

19:29.640 --> 19:34.077
Ladies and gentlemen,
President Logan and President Suvarov.

19:45.120 --> 19:49.750
They're a minute and a half ahead of
schedule. Should we tell Curtis to speed up?

19:49.840 --> 19:53.799
No, Curtis is moving as fast as he can.
A call from me won't make him move faster.

19:53.880 --> 19:57.156
- I just thought he might like to...
- I said no, Chloe.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.473
The only way to make sure
the assault happens in time

20:00.560 --> 20:02.915
is to try to slow down the signing.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.955
- What's wrong with Buchanan?
- Nothing.

20:07.040 --> 20:11.750
I think he just realises we're not
gonna be able to save the hostages.

20:27.360 --> 20:31.194
Before we begin the treaty signing,
I would like to address what's happening

20:31.280 --> 20:33.271
just a few miles away from here.

20:34.440 --> 20:38.069
As you know,
terrorists have already taken innocent life

20:38.160 --> 20:42.472
in an attempt to stop this historic treaty
from being signed.

20:42.560 --> 20:45.438
President Suvarov will not let this happen.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.318
I will not let this happen.

20:51.320 --> 20:54.312
<i>- Yes, Mike?
- I should have heard from you by now.</i>

20:54.400 --> 20:56.595
<i>- Have you gone in yet?
- We're not quite ready.</i>

20:56.680 --> 20:59.911
You have to go in now.
The president's about to sign that treaty.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.036
We're pushing as hard as we can.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.998
- Is there anything you can do?
- Like what?

21:05.080 --> 21:08.152
Can you stall things,
slow down the ceremony?

21:08.240 --> 21:11.915
Bill, the entire world
is watching this on live television.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.312
The presidents of the United States
and Russia are on stage now.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.631
This process is set in motion.
No, I can't stall.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.397
- OK, I'll call you back.
- No, stay on the phone with me.

21:23.480 --> 21:27.632
- I need to know when your people go in.
- Yes, sir.

21:29.320 --> 21:35.156
This barbaric lawlessness that's taking place
at Ontario Airport only underscores the need,

21:35.240 --> 21:37.959
the necessity for this accord

21:38.040 --> 21:41.476
and for our continued
vigilance and commitment

21:41.560 --> 21:44.028
to fighting terrorism around the world.

21:44.120 --> 21:47.908
It looks like President Logan
is going through with the signing.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.275
He's not going to give in to your demands.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.477
<i>- Are you sure this is going to work?
- It will work.</i>

21:53.560 --> 21:55.882
The only reason he is
so confident is that

21:55.967 --> 21:58.475
he thinks his rescue
attempt will save the day.

21:58.560 --> 22:03.918
- You're sure you can fend them off?
- As soon as CTU comes in that way,

22:04.000 --> 22:05.911
they'll all be killed.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.992
One of the president's aides
will then walk to the podium

22:09.080 --> 22:11.799
and whisper that there'll been no rescue.

22:11.880 --> 22:17.750
That his signature on the treaty
will be the death warrant of the hostages.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.035
<i>That will stop him, I assure you.</i>

22:20.120 --> 22:25.672
Just in case you're wrong and he signs the
treaty, be ready to carry out your threat.

22:25.760 --> 22:30.311
Every one of my men is committed
to doing what needs to be done today.

22:30.400 --> 22:36.748
We've upgraded our estimate of the number
of wounded. I need ten more ambulances.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.478
Right.

22:38.560 --> 22:42.235
The new rescue operation is
radically changed from the initial approach.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.754
It was revised based on
new intel from Jack Bauer.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.400
Which he phoned in
after being dark for 20 minutes.

22:47.480 --> 22:48.879
I need to call you back.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.952
His explanation for being out of touch
is unsatisfactory.

22:52.040 --> 22:55.430
Jack said he was trying to avoid detection.
What are you suggesting?

22:55.520 --> 22:58.398
There's too many
unusual circumstances here.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.994
I want to understand it
better before we go in.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.231
I need the transcripts of
your communication with Mr Bauer.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.151
- To what end?
- Thoroughness.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.310
Just the raw transcripts will be fine.

23:08.400 --> 23:11.358
- Fine, I'll send them to you.
- Thank you.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.920
Curtis is on line three.

23:15.720 --> 23:16.947
What's the situation?

23:17.032 --> 23:19.474
My men are in place
and setting the charges.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.551
- Any complications?
- No.

23:21.640 --> 23:26.589
We're jamming the frequency so they can't
remote detonate. We should enter on target.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.114
Good. Stay on the line until we give the go.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.191
All right, Bill. Copy.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.031
- O'Brian.
- Miss O'Brian, I'm trying to understand

23:48.120 --> 23:50.918
the transcript of Jack's last call,
and a few items...

23:51.000 --> 23:54.993
I'm busy trying to keep this revised assault
on schedule. What do you need?

23:55.080 --> 23:59.312
I don't want to slow you down, but if
you'd unlock volume five, I'd like to see...

23:59.400 --> 24:03.632
I don't need to know what you'd like to see.
OK, it's unlocked.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.790
Good.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.956
- Lynn McGill is really slowing things down.
- That's his style.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.837
I worked with him before.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.595
<i>He usually loses
20% of his staff</i>

24:14.680 --> 24:17.357
<i>in the first two days after
taking control of a new office.</i>

24:17.440 --> 24:21.149
- That many people quit?
- No, most of them were fired.

24:21.240 --> 24:25.119
In the volatile climate of the 21st century,

24:25.200 --> 24:29.512
the sharing of deterrent technologies
by responsible powers

24:29.600 --> 24:33.513
is the surest guarantee of global peace.

24:33.600 --> 24:40.676
But let this accord be proof that
our two great nations stand together

24:40.760 --> 24:45.834
in their commitment to fight
the enemies of peace and freedom.

24:52.680 --> 24:56.275
Achmed found Chevensky.
He's dead. He killed himself.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.794
- He found him in the baggage room.
- The keycard?

24:58.880 --> 25:02.395
Chevensky had it hidden
right where he said he would.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.471
Round up your men.

25:05.160 --> 25:09.199
The rest of you will work clean-up,
whoever makes it through that line of fire.

25:09.280 --> 25:13.558
Assume CTU is in body armour,
so go for the head shot.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.080
You and you.

25:17.160 --> 25:22.234
Guard the hostages.
Kill anyone who tries to break away.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.830
Head down!

25:44.320 --> 25:47.915
It is time the black night is broken

25:48.000 --> 25:50.753
by the dawning of the light of global peace.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.714
- Curtis.
- Jack, my men are in place.

26:06.800 --> 26:13.035
OK. Remember, I am in a flank-two position.
Make sure your men don't hit me.

26:13.120 --> 26:17.591
Roger that.
Ready to start the countdown on your word.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.791
Jack?

26:21.720 --> 26:25.190
- Move in at your discretion.
- All teams, we have a green light.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.953
Counting down from 60 seconds on my mark.

26:28.640 --> 26:31.757
Now. Jack, see you inside.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.111
Everyone, 60 seconds!

27:01.560 --> 27:02.709
Look out.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.279
- Stop the assault!
- Put Curtis on hold. What?

27:06.360 --> 27:09.716
They're walking into a trap.
Look at the transcript.

27:09.800 --> 27:12.553
When Jack issued a directive,
he said, "flank-two".

27:12.640 --> 27:17.839
- He was trying to give us his position.
- No, it's a duress code. He's under duress.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.130
We ran Jack's calls
through a protocol filter.

27:20.215 --> 27:22.118
They would have
found a duress signal.

27:22.200 --> 27:28.389
That's current codes. When Jack was active,
"flank-two" was a duress code.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.118
Chloe, confirm that.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.511
Jack is telling us he's being used
to send misinformation.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.034
If Curtis' teams go in now,
they'll be ambushed.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.156
- He's right.
- Curtis.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.800
Abort the countdown. Repeat: abort, abort.

27:41.880 --> 27:45.350
Stand down. All teams stand down.
We're aborting entry.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.431
We're standing down. What's wrong?

27:47.520 --> 27:49.909
We detected a duress code in Jack's call.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.356
We have to assume the terrorists
are feeding him the information.

27:53.440 --> 27:57.319
Redeploy according to the original
assault plan and do not contact Jack.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.676
- If Jack contacts you, buy time.
- Copy that. We're moving.

28:00.760 --> 28:04.673
- You're gonna outflank the terrorists?
- Yes.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.552
That should work.

28:07.640 --> 28:11.758
All teams, reposition for entry through
the east and north gates. Plan Bravo.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.434
Plan Bravo, through
the east and north gates. Go.

28:14.520 --> 28:17.478
Acknowledged. Redeploying protocol one.

28:17.560 --> 28:22.429
- What's happening?
- Please step back to the vehicle. Now.

28:44.320 --> 28:48.279
They said 60 seconds two minutes ago.
What is CTU waiting for?

28:48.360 --> 28:52.069
I don't know. You heard what I heard.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.436
It's Jack.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.071
- Jack.
- What's happening?

28:59.160 --> 29:01.390
There was a malfunction
on the entry charges.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.436
- What's the time frame?
- Any minute.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.318
We're resetting the detonators. Stand by.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.755
Copy that.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.635
They're in position.

29:14.640 --> 29:17.359
Stay ready!

29:23.680 --> 29:26.558
<i>Presidents Logan and Suvarov
are preparing to sign the treaty,</i>

29:26.640 --> 29:30.110
<i>but what should be a moment of triumph
has become a grim test of wills.</i>

29:39.480 --> 29:40.708
Yeah?

29:40.800 --> 29:44.918
- Is it done?
- No. CTU hasn't attacked yet.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.275
You said it would happen before the signing.

29:47.360 --> 29:53.435
And you told me
the president would never let it go this far.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.072
He's signing it.

29:58.160 --> 30:01.357
You have no choice. Kill them all.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.312
Fire!

30:44.040 --> 30:45.029
No!

30:59.480 --> 31:01.835
- You OK?
- Yeah.

31:02.400 --> 31:06.393
We've secured the terminal.
Besides the hostiles, no further casualties.

31:06.480 --> 31:10.029
- The remaining hostages are unharmed.
- Good work, Curtis.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.556
- Did you get that, Mike?
- Got it. Thanks, Bill. Good work.

31:28.600 --> 31:32.388
Mr President, I have some good news.

31:32.480 --> 31:37.156
I have just received word
the crisis at the Ontario Airport is over.

31:37.240 --> 31:41.597
The rescue operation
that I authorised was successful.

31:41.680 --> 31:45.593
The terrorists have been captured or killed
and, best of all,

31:45.680 --> 31:50.356
it's all been accomplished
with no further loss of innocent life.

31:57.320 --> 32:00.073
Excuse me, agent. My name is Jack Bauer.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.799
- I know who you are, sir.
- Can I use your pick?

32:05.840 --> 32:09.230
This is Derek Huxley.
His mother is at the command post.

32:09.320 --> 32:11.914
- Could you please take him there?
- Of course.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.470
- What about you?
- Come here.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.396
I have to finish this.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.273
- Take care of your mother.
- Yeah.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.839
OK?

32:33.040 --> 32:34.837
Go.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.795
We're missing one.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.310
Everybody, I need your attention.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.550
We want a man
who was being held with you.

32:56.640 --> 33:00.349
He's a white male, mid-30s.
He was wearing a bright yellow tie.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.432
Did anyone see him leave? Anyone?

33:07.760 --> 33:09.716
Keep them here until I get back.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.836
<i>Mom?</i>

33:31.920 --> 33:34.070
Derek!

33:43.240 --> 33:45.435
They were gonna kill me.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.511
Jack saved my life.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.195
He saved everyone's life.

33:54.280 --> 33:58.068
Ms Huxley,
I need you and your son to follow me.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.636
- Can I see Jack Bauer?
- I'm sorry.

34:01.720 --> 34:06.794
I have instructions to transfer you to CTU.
This way, please.

34:10.199 --> 34:12.190
Mr President.

34:12.280 --> 34:15.272
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

34:20.920 --> 34:21.909
Thank you.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.319
- Watch your step.
- I need to talk to you.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.277
Sweetheart, smile. It's over.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.511
- I need a few minutes alone with you.
- Yes, soon.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.239
No, not soon, right now.
This is very important.

34:36.320 --> 34:40.518
Martha, when I'm done with this,
I'll call for you.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.596
- I promise.
- All right, this ends now.

34:43.679 --> 34:48.435
I have played my role without interfering.
Now it is time for you to attend to me.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.512
- And I will.
- Do not patronise me!

34:51.600 --> 34:54.956
Something is going on.
I am not crying wolf again.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.109
Martha.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.510
Please.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.478
Do not ruin this moment for me.

35:04.280 --> 35:06.157
We'll talk later.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.799
Martha?

35:13.880 --> 35:17.190
- Everything all right?
- No, it's not all right.

35:17.280 --> 35:22.070
I have to talk to my husband. The situation
is more dangerous than he realises.

35:22.160 --> 35:24.958
What situation is that?

35:25.960 --> 35:30.158
I'm sorry, Walt.
I can only talk to Charles about this.

35:45.520 --> 35:49.832
Colette confirms the area's been contained
with only minor injuries among the hostages.

35:49.920 --> 35:54.357
Good, thank you. Route all field updates
through Mr McGill for the time being.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.271
OK.

35:57.840 --> 36:01.037
- Bill, if you have a moment...
- Lynn, uh...

36:01.120 --> 36:03.270
- I owe you an apology.
- For what?

36:03.360 --> 36:07.319
If you hadn't recognised the duress code
that Jack transmitted...

36:07.400 --> 36:10.756
Bill, you're the reason
I figured out what he was doing.

36:10.840 --> 36:14.230
- What do you mean?
- I admit I was suspicious of Mr Bauer.

36:14.320 --> 36:18.757
You were so adamant about his integrity,
I looked to reconcile the contradiction.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.831
<i>So, thank you.</i>

36:24.240 --> 36:26.427
Has Mr Bauer been
taken into custody?

36:26.512 --> 36:29.189
We'll debrief him here,
but not as a suspect.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.590
He's not cleared in the deaths of
David Palmer and Michelle Dessler.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.558
Based on mitigating evidence
and Chloe's testimony,

36:35.640 --> 36:38.598
we're confident that Jack
was framed for those murders.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.513
I appreciate that,
but it doesn't change the situation.

36:41.600 --> 36:46.071
We have surveillance footage placing Jack
at the site of David Palmer's assassination.

36:46.160 --> 36:50.153
- Clearly it was doctored.
- Not according to preliminary tests.

36:50.240 --> 36:53.835
To get to the bottom of this,
Jack Bauer has a lot to answer for.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.309
Bring him in, now.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.788
- The rest of the terminal is clear.
- Yes, sir.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.790
Jack.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.156
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you. We got a problem.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.834
A hostage is missing.
He was working with them.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.639
- Describe him, I'll take care of it.
- I'll help you.

37:21.720 --> 37:25.395
You need to go back to CTU. Buchanan
gave orders to take you into custody.

37:25.480 --> 37:29.155
I watched Beresch give this guy a keycard.
Something else is going down.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.118
- We've got to find this guy now.
- I'll get right on it.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.670
But I need you to go with these men. Please.

37:37.640 --> 37:42.156
He's a white male, mid-30s.
He was wearing a dark suit and a yellow tie.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.754
- He's about 5'8".
- We'll find him.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.035
OK. Thanks.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.109
- These are my weapons.
- OK.

37:52.200 --> 37:55.237
Alteri, Hutchison.
Possible sleeper among the hostages.

37:55.320 --> 37:58.869
We're looking for a Caucasian male,
5'8", dark suit, yellow tie.

38:14.880 --> 38:18.316
- Where have you been?
- We had a problem with Chevensky.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.870
- Where is he?
- Dead.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.678
You have the key?

39:03.840 --> 39:05.637
Masks.

39:46.200 --> 39:50.273
<i>- Do you have the merchandise?
- Yes. We're moving the canisters out now.</i>

39:50.360 --> 39:54.956
Good. Transportation's been arranged.
Call me when you're out.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.951
I will.

40:10.000 --> 40:15.028
<i>Today is a historic day for both
the United States and Russia alike.</i>

40:15.120 --> 40:18.874
<i>Presidents Logan and Suvarov,
having signed the arms treaty agreement</i>

40:18.960 --> 40:22.236
<i>which will impact on arms reduction
between both countries,</i>

40:22.320 --> 40:25.392
<i>will now greet the press
to discuss the unprecedented weight</i>

40:25.480 --> 40:27.516
<i>of what has just been put in motion.</i>

40:27.600 --> 40:32.310
<i>This will be remembered as a significant day
for President Logan, perhaps...</i>

40:34.000 --> 40:38.232
Evelyn, did you have a chance
to speak to my husband?

40:39.305 --> 40:45.389
