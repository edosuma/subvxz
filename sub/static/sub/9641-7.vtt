WEBVTT

00:09.593 --> 00:12.151
No! Stop following me!
Go away!

00:18.571 --> 00:20.971
Harper!

00:22.471 --> 00:24.233
Really?!

00:25.099 --> 00:26.663
Alex, I'm sorry.

00:26.697 --> 00:28.628
I knew you'd be annoyed
by physical activity,

00:28.663 --> 00:30.228
so I'm training
while you're asleep.

00:30.263 --> 00:31.495
Well, I'm awake.

00:31.528 --> 00:33.593
Your invisible
dogs woke me up.

00:34.995 --> 00:36.959
Alex, I'm training
for the marathon.

00:36.993 --> 00:38.925
And sorry about
the dog noises.

00:38.960 --> 00:43.061
It helps me run faster when I feel
like dogs are about to eat my face.

00:43.095 --> 00:46.331
Why would you ever
want to run 26 miles?

00:46.366 --> 00:49.797
The same reason you stayed on the
couch for the entire month of July.

00:49.832 --> 00:51.497
Oh, I get it!

00:51.532 --> 00:53.931
A sense of accomplishment.

00:55.133 --> 00:58.367
Setting a goal and
then achieving it.

00:58.402 --> 01:01.632
Well, then, I guess
I should be supportive here.

01:01.666 --> 01:03.565
All right, what's the
thing that people say?

01:03.600 --> 01:05.666
Oh, yeah...
Keep it down!

Har... Harper!

02:12.640 --> 02:14.174
What's up,
what're you doing?

02:14.208 --> 02:16.675
I'm blending up all this
fruit to make a smoothie.

02:16.709 --> 02:19.276
That's actually
an awesome idea.

02:19.311 --> 02:21.411
A drinkable meal.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.012
I really hate chewing.

02:24.848 --> 02:27.415
Birds are so lucky. Their moms
just chew up their food

02:27.449 --> 02:29.649
and they spit it
right in their mouths.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.551
I really wish my dad
married a bird.

02:41.826 --> 02:43.126
Hey, honey!

02:43.160 --> 02:44.827
Look how healthy
Harper's eating.

02:44.862 --> 02:47.795
Oh, yeah! You know she's
training to run a marathon.

02:48.129 --> 02:50.330
You must be very proud
of your daughter.

02:52.332 --> 02:54.632
Yes, we are.
That's our daughter.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.767
Come on, she's not
your daughter.

02:58.502 --> 03:00.402
Hey, guys! Check it out.

03:00.437 --> 03:03.537
If you put cereal on hot dogs,
it counts as breakfast.

03:05.506 --> 03:07.173
That's your daughter.

03:07.208 --> 03:09.041
Yeah.

03:09.075 --> 03:11.609
It's so hard to be
filled with pride

03:11.644 --> 03:13.077
and have no one
to give it to.

03:14.712 --> 03:15.679
Hey, you should
be proud of me.

03:15.713 --> 03:18.448
I got a whole bookcase full
of trophies in my bedroom.

03:18.482 --> 03:20.416
The... Scholastic Decathlon,

03:20.450 --> 03:23.651
debate team and the Alien
Language League, among others.

03:23.686 --> 03:26.987
And that's not even counting ribbons
or my pat-on-the-back photo album.

03:27.021 --> 03:29.456
You know, honey, we
are very proud of you.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.590
But... come on,

03:31.625 --> 03:33.358
those awards required

03:33.393 --> 03:36.861
no physical movement
on your part.

03:36.895 --> 03:40.196
All right, I'm gonna start training
for that marathon right now.

03:40.231 --> 03:43.799
Right after I get a pedicure to
strengthen my toenails for the big run.

03:48.203 --> 03:50.770
All right, come on, Harper.

03:50.804 --> 03:54.206
Eat your breakfast dog so that we can
go upstairs and do some couch-camping.

03:55.241 --> 03:57.542
Alex, that's so unhealthy.

03:57.576 --> 04:01.345
My body's a machine and I have to fuel it
with the best that nature has to offer.

04:01.379 --> 04:04.881
Well, I got these
from the hot dog guy,

04:04.915 --> 04:07.048
and he definitely
smells like nature.

04:08.550 --> 04:10.417
Alex, I'm in training.

04:10.452 --> 04:14.654
You still haven't given up on
that crazy marathon idea yet?

04:14.689 --> 04:16.856
It's been, like...

04:16.891 --> 04:18.925
Like, four hours.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.761
When I set my mind to
something, I stay on it

04:22.795 --> 04:24.029
until I come out a winner.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.897
Remember all those
spelling bees I entered?

04:25.931 --> 04:27.932
I kept at it until I won.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.401
Yeah, I remember.

04:30.435 --> 04:32.369
Who won that
tae kwon do contest?

04:32.404 --> 04:34.838
That's right. This girl.

04:37.374 --> 04:40.476
That smoothie didn't
even see it coming.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.951
Justin, I just got your text

04:52.787 --> 04:54.154
and I am so on it, man.

04:54.188 --> 04:56.289
I'm going to train you
to win that marathon.

04:56.323 --> 04:59.224
All right, dude, let's do what it
takes 'cause I need this trophy.

04:59.259 --> 05:01.427
Well, then we start right now.
Crab walk!

05:01.461 --> 05:04.296
- Crab walk. Crab walk.
- Crab walk?

05:04.330 --> 05:06.464
Crab walk it out.
Love that!

05:06.499 --> 05:08.299
Love that. Bring it up,
let's do a duck walk.

05:08.334 --> 05:11.302
Let's do a duck walk! Quack, quack,
quack it out. Love that, love that.

05:11.337 --> 05:13.871
Let's cool it down. Let's just
cool it down with some leapfrogs.

05:13.906 --> 05:15.406
- Leapfrogs?
- Ready!

05:17.809 --> 05:19.777
Love it. Good extension.

05:19.811 --> 05:21.644
- Good release.
- Feels good.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.483
Is that your son?

05:30.651 --> 05:32.018
No!

05:46.395 --> 05:48.128
I'm not wearing my cat suit!

05:48.162 --> 05:51.130
I told you I never would.
Please just stop chasing me.

05:52.399 --> 05:53.866
Harper!

05:55.768 --> 05:57.402
Harper!

06:03.108 --> 06:06.311
Alex! I could have fallen.

06:06.346 --> 06:08.846
Harper, when you moved in here,

06:08.880 --> 06:12.982
you promised me that you would
never, ever, ever run a marathon.

06:13.017 --> 06:14.550
Dear, I never said that.

06:16.353 --> 06:19.754
Look, I'm half asleep, so my lies
aren't really good right now.

06:20.822 --> 06:22.323
Alex, I'm sorry,

06:22.357 --> 06:24.958
but I've got to keep training.
I'm up to eight miles.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.826
If all goes well, I should be
able to finish a marathon in...

06:27.860 --> 06:30.393
About three years. Yeah.

06:34.563 --> 06:37.532
Three more years
of that squeaking?

06:39.634 --> 06:42.568
I've never used magic
before my alarm clock went off.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.372
I don't have an alarm clock.

06:48.542 --> 06:53.145
I wish there was some sort
of finish-a-marathon spell.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.180
Oh, look, a
finish-a-marathon spell!

06:56.582 --> 06:58.216
I love magic.

07:03.787 --> 07:05.522
Thanks, Alex.

07:05.556 --> 07:06.823
You're so supportive.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.161
All right!

07:12.195 --> 07:14.129
Come on, Finkle!
You can do this!

07:14.164 --> 07:15.830
Push it, push it,
push it!

07:17.432 --> 07:19.766
"Gnip-gnop, hippity-hop,

07:19.801 --> 07:22.735
run 26.2 miles,
then stop."

07:27.041 --> 07:29.341
These protein bars work fast.

07:37.314 --> 07:39.215
Thanks for coming out.

07:41.151 --> 07:43.686
Oh, cool! Are we gonna
throw that at the runners?

07:43.720 --> 07:47.188
No, this a drinkable meal.
I'm selling them.

07:47.223 --> 07:49.391
This is a special blend of
coffee, eggs, hash browns,

07:49.425 --> 07:51.592
and a napkin.

07:51.627 --> 07:54.462
So you don't have to wipe your
face after you're done drinking it.

07:55.897 --> 07:57.697
Max, people aren't
gonna stop running

07:57.732 --> 07:59.499
to buy your cups of mud.

07:59.533 --> 08:03.135
Alex, you're obviously
not a business person.

08:03.169 --> 08:05.103
They run by, grab the cup,

08:05.137 --> 08:08.005
I write down their
number and bill them.

08:09.741 --> 08:12.809
Well, good luck trying to track
down the runners from Kenya.

08:14.578 --> 08:17.547
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sorry. Sorry.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.787
Oh, hey, Alex! I've got the
Alien Language League members

08:24.821 --> 08:27.489
set up at every mile
to cheer Justin on.

08:27.524 --> 08:30.158
Well, up until mile four,
then we ran out of people.

08:35.730 --> 08:38.032
Oh, my gosh!
It's Harper!

08:38.066 --> 08:41.268
She's the lead runner.
She could win this thing.

08:41.302 --> 08:43.203
Let's run to
the finish line.

08:43.236 --> 08:47.540
- That's four miles.
- You're right. Let's take a cab.

08:47.574 --> 08:50.509
- Oh, shotgun!
- Sure. It's a cab.

08:52.712 --> 08:54.445
Hold on.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.383
A 16 year-old girl with three weeks of
training is going to win a marathon?

09:00.417 --> 09:02.985
Does that seem
weird to you, Alex?

09:04.220 --> 09:05.953
Oh, my gosh!
It's a miracle!

09:05.987 --> 09:09.889
Go, Harper!
Slow down, but go!

09:12.691 --> 09:15.360
Harper, we are
so proud of you!

09:15.395 --> 09:17.295
Where should we display
your winning trophy?

09:17.330 --> 09:19.797
- In my room.
- Oh, don't be silly!

09:21.668 --> 09:24.869
Other people should know that
a Russo won the marathon.

09:25.104 --> 09:26.803
She's not a Russo.

09:27.038 --> 09:29.639
Until one of you kids
wins a marathon, she is.

09:34.211 --> 09:37.346
Congratulations, Harper. You
know what I'm gonna do for you?

09:37.381 --> 09:41.448
I'm going to make you my special
after-marathon-get-relaxed smoothie.

09:41.483 --> 09:45.018
Herbal tea, warm milk and
a jasmine-scented candle.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.988
But Max, you're not allowed
to play with candles anymore.

09:48.023 --> 09:50.057
Or a blender,
so shut up about it.

10:01.499 --> 10:03.032
Justin, you made it.
Where you been?

10:03.367 --> 10:05.834
I was finishing the marathon.
Where were you?

10:06.268 --> 10:08.936
I wore the alien mask,
like we discussed,

10:08.970 --> 10:12.239
when I crossed the finish line, and there
was no one there to take the picture.

10:12.274 --> 10:17.111
Without the picture
it was just... stupid.

10:17.145 --> 10:20.013
I'm sorry, dude. I got distracted
watching Harper win the marathon.

10:20.048 --> 10:24.116
It was amazing. She was like my weird Uncle
Charlie, chasing after the garbage truck.

10:24.151 --> 10:27.154
It was... a sight to see.

10:27.188 --> 10:30.025
Wait a minute! So you're saying
that Harper won the marathon?

10:30.459 --> 10:31.960
Yeah, but don't worry, honey.

10:31.994 --> 10:34.362
You still have all those
trophies from...

10:34.396 --> 10:35.996
That book stuff.

10:37.698 --> 10:39.665
I didn't even see her.
It was like...

10:39.900 --> 10:41.033
It was...

10:41.068 --> 10:43.502
She must have passed me when
I was putting on the mask.

10:43.636 --> 10:45.070
Yeah.

10:45.105 --> 10:48.606
Well, I'm gonna go soak my
feet, try to save the toenails.

10:52.010 --> 10:54.311
Alex, Harper, a word.

10:55.647 --> 11:00.350
Look what I found in the
area-where-Alex-hides-things area.

11:00.383 --> 11:04.853
Well, it's time to move
that area again.

11:05.187 --> 11:08.389
A page torn out of
The Cheaters' Book of Spells.

11:08.924 --> 11:10.424
Daddy, I...

11:10.459 --> 11:13.260
I think you and I should
probably talk about that alone.

11:13.295 --> 11:15.028
Not that I know
what that is or...

11:15.063 --> 11:18.431
It describes a spell to help
someone finish a marathon.

11:18.665 --> 11:20.533
And now we need
to talk about

11:20.567 --> 11:23.535
not knowing what
"talking alone" means.

11:23.570 --> 11:26.271
Oh, my gosh, Alex! You used
magic on me so I'd win?!

11:26.305 --> 11:29.207
Not on you.
Just your feet.

11:29.741 --> 11:33.144
I'm sorry, Harper. I just couldn't take
it anymore, your constant training,

11:33.178 --> 11:37.247
and your healthy eating. You said you were
gonna keep at it until you finished one.

11:37.482 --> 11:39.482
You know, Alex, I thought
you learned your lesson

11:39.517 --> 11:42.552
when we grounded you when you did this
to Harper at the fifth-grade spelling bee.

11:42.586 --> 11:44.053
Hey, I won that!

11:45.622 --> 11:48.490
Oh, my gosh!

11:48.524 --> 11:51.525
My fifth grade spelling
bee trophy is a total sham?

11:51.559 --> 11:55.928
Well, Harper, you didn't know about
magic back then so I couldn't tell you.

11:55.963 --> 11:58.397
Are all of my achievements
a lie because of you?

11:58.431 --> 12:00.199
No. Not all of them.

12:00.233 --> 12:02.867
You... you dressed
yourself today.

12:07.039 --> 12:10.040
Mr. Russo, may I please see
The Cheater's Book of Spells?

12:10.075 --> 12:11.608
Sure.

12:14.045 --> 12:15.712
"Win at jumping roping spell."

12:16.246 --> 12:17.280
Guilty.

12:17.314 --> 12:19.915
"Achieve black belt
in tae kwon do."

12:20.449 --> 12:21.983
Guilty.

12:22.217 --> 12:23.784
"Picked first for kickball?!"

12:23.818 --> 12:26.319
I'm surprised you didn't
figure that one out on your own.

12:28.389 --> 12:29.889
Well, that's just great, Alex.

12:29.923 --> 12:33.126
Some of my biggest achievements
in life are lies because of you.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.994
Now, I wouldn't say

12:35.028 --> 12:37.229
"picked first in kickball"

12:37.263 --> 12:39.230
is a big achievement.

12:40.465 --> 12:42.966
Well, I guess I wouldn't know.

12:47.970 --> 12:50.738
We don't have to give
back the trophy, right?

12:54.736 --> 12:56.737
So you're telling me

12:56.771 --> 13:00.173
that Alex used magic so Harper
would win the marathon?

13:00.207 --> 13:02.608
I can't believe
it's all been a lie.

13:04.211 --> 13:06.478
How could Alex do
this to our daughter?

13:08.948 --> 13:10.715
So the trophy's a fake?

13:11.150 --> 13:12.984
This is the best news ever!

13:14.119 --> 13:16.586
Well, Harper's pretty
broken up about it.

13:17.555 --> 13:19.389
So what? Alex cheated.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.057
She's a cheater!

13:21.091 --> 13:23.759
I can still be the first Russo
to win an athletic trophy.

13:23.794 --> 13:26.929
I'm gonna train hard, eat right
and win the next marathon.

13:26.963 --> 13:30.599
Yeah. I'll start as soon
as my toenails grow back.

13:36.474 --> 13:38.041
See what you've done?

13:38.076 --> 13:40.210
Not only have you hurt
Harper's feelings,

13:40.244 --> 13:43.779
but you've sent your brother
off on an unrealistic goal.

13:45.181 --> 13:47.416
Why? His toenails
will grow back.

13:49.652 --> 13:52.620
But, I do feel
bad about Harper.

13:52.655 --> 13:55.255
Well, I don't know how you're
going to make her feel better.

13:55.290 --> 13:59.159
I mean it's not like she can do
all those competitions over again.

13:59.193 --> 14:00.760
Oh, shoot!

14:02.495 --> 14:03.629
What's wrong?

14:03.663 --> 14:06.764
I think I accidentally
gave her an idea.

14:07.099 --> 14:09.233
Yes, you did!

14:15.873 --> 14:16.940
Okay.

14:18.209 --> 14:20.976
And... open your eyes!

14:22.845 --> 14:25.580
It's bad enough you've ruined
all my victories with magic,

14:25.614 --> 14:28.115
and now you've made a
banner to remind me of it?

14:28.150 --> 14:31.253
No, no, no, we're gonna
recreate those competitions,

14:31.287 --> 14:34.022
starting with your
fifth grade spelling bee.

14:34.057 --> 14:36.825
And I won't use magic this time,
so you can win fair and square.

14:36.859 --> 14:40.695
How do I know you're not using
magic to make me agree to do this?

14:43.899 --> 14:46.599
Would it make you feel better
if I let you hold my wand?

14:46.834 --> 14:48.134
Yes, it would.

14:50.704 --> 14:53.406
No, no, take it back. That
thing gives me the creeps.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.508
Don't be afraid, Finkle.

14:55.542 --> 14:59.845
Your first word might be
"bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk"!

14:59.879 --> 15:03.015
Are you calling the 18th Street
spelling bee champ a chicken?

15:03.049 --> 15:06.652
If the egg fits, lay it.

15:07.854 --> 15:09.855
Let's go, Carol!

15:13.393 --> 15:15.761
Okey. Are you ready
for your word, Max?

15:15.795 --> 15:17.329
Max.

15:19.064 --> 15:23.166
M-A-C-K-S.

15:23.201 --> 15:25.301
Max.

15:25.635 --> 15:27.069
That isn't your word.

15:27.104 --> 15:29.238
That's your name.

15:29.272 --> 15:31.040
And you misspelled it.

15:33.109 --> 15:35.310
I should've asked
for a definition.

15:40.817 --> 15:44.518
Okay, Carol,
your word is...

15:44.553 --> 15:48.685
Hippopotomonstroses-
quipedaliophobia.

15:52.153 --> 15:54.453
Could you use it
in a sentence?

15:56.589 --> 16:00.959
Hippopotomonstrosesquipedalio-
phobia is an annoying word,

16:00.993 --> 16:02.826
and I'm not gonna
say it again.

16:05.096 --> 16:07.631
That's the sentence.

16:12.936 --> 16:17.839
Hippopotomonstroses-
quipedaliophobia.

16:25.713 --> 16:31.650
H-I-P-P-O-P-O-T-O-M-O-N-S-T-R-O-S-E-
S-Q-U-I-P-E-D-A-L-I-O-P-H-O-B-I-A.

16:33.086 --> 16:36.221
Hippopotomonstroses-
quipedaliophobia.

16:38.257 --> 16:39.490
Correct.

16:40.859 --> 16:43.793
Okay, Harper,
your word is...

16:43.828 --> 16:46.429
- "Sergeant."
- Easy one.

16:46.763 --> 16:47.730
Sergeant.

16:47.764 --> 16:53.635
S-E-R-G-A-E-N-T.

16:54.971 --> 16:57.006
Harper, that's not right.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.109
I'm sorry, you're out
of the competition.

17:03.313 --> 17:04.980
Oh, cork it, Carol!

17:07.550 --> 17:09.385
Way to make me
feel better, Alex.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.686
No, no, no! It's not
just one and done.

17:11.721 --> 17:13.288
We've got more.
Come on!

17:13.623 --> 17:19.459
2225, 2226, 2227, 2...
Why did you stop?

17:19.493 --> 17:23.262
Well, I could've gone longer, but it
looked like your dad was going to pass out.

17:24.364 --> 17:26.431
No, I'm fine.

17:26.465 --> 17:28.566
What?

17:28.601 --> 17:30.735
Is the room spinning?

17:33.638 --> 17:36.338
How do you do this?
I think I need a watch.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.175
Jump rope.
Justin, get in there.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.811
This is perfect cardio
for the marathon.

17:43.845 --> 17:47.214
Teddy bear, Teddy
bear, turn around.

17:47.248 --> 17:50.817
Teddy bear, Teddy bear,
touch the ground.

17:50.851 --> 17:52.185
- Teddy bear...
- Zeke!

17:53.386 --> 17:54.720
Do it in your head!

17:54.754 --> 17:56.621
Sorry. All right.

17:56.656 --> 17:58.656
And here we go and...

17:58.691 --> 17:59.957
- Now.
- Zeke.

17:59.992 --> 18:02.059
Okay, we're gonna go again.
Coming up right now.

18:02.094 --> 18:04.194
Here we go! Okay.

18:04.229 --> 18:06.129
And going again,
right now. Go!

18:06.164 --> 18:08.531
All right, go again, right now.
Quick, go! Go quick! Now!

18:08.565 --> 18:10.099
Zeke! Okay...

18:11.001 --> 18:12.301
You're messing
up my timing.

18:12.335 --> 18:14.736
- Hurry up, dude! My arms
are getting dizzy. - Dizzy?

18:14.770 --> 18:17.137
There, you missed.
Get out.

18:22.075 --> 18:24.276
All right, Harper,
show her how it's done.

18:24.710 --> 18:25.810
Daddy!

18:26.145 --> 18:27.378
Is it Christmas?

18:33.051 --> 18:37.120
- All right. - All right,
I just gotta beat 2227.

18:37.154 --> 18:39.922
People, grab a chair.
This is gonna take a while.

18:41.624 --> 18:43.358
One. One...

18:46.062 --> 18:48.597
And... one.

18:51.499 --> 18:52.533
Thank you.

18:55.870 --> 18:58.138
I'm sorry, Harper.

18:58.172 --> 18:59.672
Thanks for coming out.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.674
My pleasure. Although I wish
you would've let her go first.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.808
It would've saved me about
three hours of jumping rope.

19:08.943 --> 19:12.047
Just take your victory
and leave, Connie!

19:14.950 --> 19:16.951
Oh... well, this...

19:16.985 --> 19:18.686
This is just like real life.

19:18.721 --> 19:20.554
You can't win all
of them, right?

19:20.588 --> 19:23.322
But there's no way that you're
gonna lose the next one.

19:26.525 --> 19:28.726
I wasn't ready.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.360
Get up! We're
not done here.

19:30.395 --> 19:32.829
- But she's done.
- Hey!

19:32.863 --> 19:36.131
In my day, the fight wasn't
over until you saw bone!

19:36.166 --> 19:37.999
Give me my black belt.

19:38.034 --> 19:39.200
Make me.

19:39.234 --> 19:40.467
- Hey...!
- Just kidding.

19:40.502 --> 19:42.236
You already made me.

19:42.670 --> 19:45.540
Daddy, why did you give
me this idea? It's horrible.

19:45.574 --> 19:47.042
That's not all
that's horrible.

19:47.076 --> 19:49.247
I'm pretty sure the
old lady ripped one.

19:52.686 --> 19:55.021
All right. It was me.

19:55.055 --> 19:56.889
It happens when I exert.

19:59.925 --> 20:02.259
I'd help her up, but then
you'd get another one.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.178
Hey, Harper.

20:12.213 --> 20:13.879
I made you a smoothie
to cheer you up.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.948
- You all right? - I'm okay.
I mean, it probably have felt good

20:18.983 --> 20:21.251
to win at least one
of the rematches.

20:22.386 --> 20:24.354
I'm so sorry, Harper.

20:24.388 --> 20:26.222
Your friendship
means the world to me.

20:26.256 --> 20:29.524
And I only used magic because
I wanted you to feel good.

20:30.559 --> 20:33.227
I mean, I wouldn't have
set up all these rematches

20:33.261 --> 20:36.396
if I knew you were going
to lose all of them.

20:37.131 --> 20:40.467
It's okay. I mean, you don't have to
apologize, I learned something important.

20:40.501 --> 20:43.769
It's better to lose and know you lost
on your own than to cheat and win.

20:43.803 --> 20:48.972
I also learned how to say
"hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia".

20:49.007 --> 20:50.607
I learned one thing.

20:54.444 --> 20:56.877
When did you become the most
amazing person in my life?

20:57.211 --> 20:58.779
The first day we met
in kindergarten,

20:58.813 --> 21:01.414
when we had to take naps in
different rooms because we snored.

21:06.553 --> 21:08.521
Okay, so you're not gonna
use any more magic on me?

21:08.555 --> 21:09.922
- No.
- Even if I ask for it?

21:09.956 --> 21:14.559
Yep. But... Okay, what
if we're like really old,

21:14.593 --> 21:19.297
like 30, and then our
hair starts turning gray,

21:19.331 --> 21:22.164
and our skin looks
like Dad's old wallet,

21:22.198 --> 21:23.964
and our butts
are dragging...

21:23.998 --> 21:25.398
Okay, okay!

21:27.000 --> 21:30.301
- We can use magic to fix that.
But nothing else. - Okay.

21:30.335 --> 21:33.771
It feels nice to have all my victories
and losses in life be magic-free.

21:35.005 --> 21:37.541
Well...

21:37.575 --> 21:40.311
Well, what?

21:40.346 --> 21:42.681
Remember when we were
kids at Coney Island,

21:42.715 --> 21:44.749
and we raced each other
to the hot dog stand?

21:44.783 --> 21:46.919
So, wait, you used
magic to beat me?

21:46.953 --> 21:49.955
- Well, then, why don't we just do
a rematch of that? - Seriously?

21:49.990 --> 21:51.990
We can just race to the
bus stop around the corner.

21:52.025 --> 21:55.694
- All right, Mr. Russo, you call "go".
- Okay, you ready, girls?

21:55.729 --> 21:59.131
Ready? Set. No magic!

21:59.166 --> 22:00.199
Daddy!

22:00.233 --> 22:02.234
I just really wanted
to tell you, honey,

22:02.268 --> 22:05.804
a minute ago I was proud of Harper,
but now I'm really proud of you, too.

22:05.838 --> 22:06.971
Okay, thank you.

22:07.006 --> 22:09.106
And I really just
wanted to make sure

22:09.140 --> 22:11.141
that you didn't
win the race.

22:11.209 --> 22:13.578
So, go ahead.

22:16.482 --> 22:18.349
I'm sorry.

22:18.383 --> 22:22.787
I just really wanted to make
sure that I could be proud of you.

22:22.821 --> 22:24.921
Okay, go!

22:24.956 --> 22:26.790
Wait up, Harper!
