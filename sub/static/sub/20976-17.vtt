00:06.367 --> 00:08.633
- I'm baaaack!

00:08.633 --> 00:10.500
- I know what the inside
of you looks like.

00:10.500 --> 00:13.133
- You're the only guy
who's ever admitted to that.

00:13.133 --> 00:15.166
- [laughs]
- "I know the inside of you."

00:15.166 --> 00:17.567
- Yeah, that wasn't
the best choice of words.

00:17.567 --> 00:19.533
- Yes, mama.

00:19.533 --> 00:21.533
Headlines around the world:

00:21.533 --> 00:24.133
"Man Spends $80,000

00:24.133 --> 00:25.533
to Look Like Britney Spears."

00:25.533 --> 00:27.133
It's Bryan, bitch.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.166
- [laughs]

00:28.166 --> 00:30.033
What was his idea

00:30.033 --> 00:31.433
with putting an adjustable
implant in there?

00:31.433 --> 00:33.033
- Would allow me to adjust
the size of the breast

00:33.033 --> 00:35.166
if we had any issues
after surgery.

00:35.166 --> 00:36.433
I still have the valve.

00:36.433 --> 00:38.133
- You're kidding me.

00:38.133 --> 00:40.333
Boy, I've never seen
an implant like this.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.066
The fill tube and the port

00:42.066 --> 00:44.300
is in another part
of her breast tissue,

00:44.300 --> 00:46.333
and I can't find it.

00:46.333 --> 00:48.200
What the hell is that?

00:48.200 --> 00:51.333
- ♪ I wanna be sexy,
sexy, sexy ♪

00:51.333 --> 00:53.600
♪ I wanna be hot, hot ♪

00:53.600 --> 00:56.200
♪ Fix me, make me beautiful ♪

00:56.200 --> 00:58.333
♪ ♪

00:58.333 --> 01:00.467
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

01:00.467 --> 01:03.467
- Guess who's back!

01:03.467 --> 01:05.066
My nodules.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.200
I'm Rajee.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.467
You all might recognize me.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.600
I'm an old friend
of the doctors'.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.467
About ten years ago,

01:11.467 --> 01:15.467
I went for black market
silicone injections.

01:15.467 --> 01:17.600
You know, make myself
a little more feminine

01:17.600 --> 01:20.500
and bring out the girl
that was inside of me,

01:20.500 --> 01:23.433
match my insides
with my outsides.

01:23.433 --> 01:27.467
Unfortunately, I had
a horrible reaction in my face,

01:27.467 --> 01:30.100
and then all hell broke loose.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.500
It's hard enough being

01:31.500 --> 01:33.633
a transgendered woman
in this world,

01:33.633 --> 01:37.633
but try being transgender
with a distorted face.

01:37.633 --> 01:39.600
The first time
I met the doctors,

01:39.600 --> 01:42.100
they really felt like

01:42.100 --> 01:44.467
they weren't able to do
any sort of surgery.

01:44.467 --> 01:47.633
A year later,
I get that phone call

01:47.633 --> 01:49.500
from Dr. Dubrow,

01:49.500 --> 01:53.467
and then he says to me,
"I think I figured out a way."

01:53.467 --> 01:57.633
And I ended up having surgeries.

01:57.633 --> 02:00.333
- What was that noise?

02:00.333 --> 02:03.266
- Concrete.
Can I have the saw?

02:03.266 --> 02:04.266
- Yikes.

02:04.266 --> 02:05.633
[saw buzzing]

02:05.633 --> 02:07.500
- It was fantastic.

02:07.500 --> 02:11.266
I mean, I literally had
a new face.

02:11.266 --> 02:13.500
I've been an activist
for, like, 18 years now,

02:13.500 --> 02:16.266
but, my goodness,
after my surgery,

02:16.266 --> 02:20.400
it just seemed like my platform
got so much bigger.

02:20.400 --> 02:25.133
I am the face
of Miami AIDS Walk,

02:25.133 --> 02:29.767
and I received the 2016

02:29.767 --> 02:32.266
Transgender Equality Award.

02:32.266 --> 02:35.767
So I was flying high
for the last year.

02:35.767 --> 02:38.400
Life was just phenomenal.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.400
But one morning,

02:39.400 --> 02:41.667
I was washing my face,

02:41.667 --> 02:44.567
and I felt a little, tiny lump.

02:44.567 --> 02:48.166
And within a week,
I could see it.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.433
I was like, "Oh, no.
They're back."

02:50.433 --> 02:52.567
That really freaked me out.

02:52.567 --> 02:56.266
And now my eyes are pulling down
a little bit

02:56.266 --> 02:57.433
by the new lumps,

02:57.433 --> 02:59.266
so I reached out to Dr. Dubrow,

02:59.266 --> 03:02.533
and literally
in less than two minutes,

03:02.533 --> 03:05.000
he was calling me back,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
and he's like,
"Don't worry about it.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.533
"We're gonna take care
of this.

03:08.533 --> 03:10.166
You're coming back out here."

03:10.166 --> 03:11.533
They did it before,

03:11.533 --> 03:13.400
and I know
that they're gonna do it again.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.433
- My name is Brittany,
I am 27,

03:17.433 --> 03:19.300
and I am from
Chesapeake, Virginia.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.300
These breasts have never been
a perfect match.

03:22.300 --> 03:26.433
When I hit puberty
is really when I saw that I had

03:26.433 --> 03:29.333
a issue with my breasts
and the asymmetry in them.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.333
And I didn't know
that's what it was at the time.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.734
I just thought I had
different-sized breasts.

03:33.734 --> 03:35.333
The left one was not fitting
into a cup

03:35.333 --> 03:36.700
the way the right one was.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.467
This is something
I have kept to myself,

03:39.467 --> 03:41.166
I kept from my family,
my friends.

03:41.166 --> 03:42.600
The first person to know

03:42.600 --> 03:46.533
was the guy I started seeing
when I was 16.

03:46.533 --> 03:48.333
Then he started questioning,
"Do you think it's medical?

03:48.333 --> 03:50.200
Do you think
something's wrong?"

03:50.200 --> 03:52.433
The first consultation I had
with my plastic surgeon,

03:52.433 --> 03:54.433
he pointed out that it was
a cosmetic issue

03:54.433 --> 03:58.700
and laid out, really,
only one option for me,

03:58.700 --> 04:00.567
and it was to have
an implant put in

04:00.567 --> 04:03.467
and the bigger boob lifted
and reduced.

04:03.467 --> 04:05.600
The surgeon did show me
the adjustable valve

04:05.600 --> 04:07.633
he was gonna attach
to the saline implant

04:07.633 --> 04:09.467
on the left breast,
and at the time,

04:09.467 --> 04:10.767
I was like, "Wait.
You're gonna do what?

04:10.767 --> 04:12.633
"Like, you're gonna put
this valve in me?

04:12.633 --> 04:14.200
Is it gonna be in there
the rest of my life?"

04:14.200 --> 04:16.066
He told me what it was for:

04:16.066 --> 04:18.333
so he could adjust sizing
after surgery if we needed to,

04:18.333 --> 04:21.367
but he never once addressed
taking that valve out.

04:21.367 --> 04:22.767
I just assumed
that it was gonna stay

04:22.767 --> 04:24.500
attached to the implant
the rest of my life.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.233
So a week out of surgery

04:26.233 --> 04:28.233
is when I saw my breasts
for the first time.

04:28.233 --> 04:30.500
Like, the right one kind of had
this natural look to it,

04:30.500 --> 04:32.767
and the left one had
this fake look to it.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.633
The surgeon's plan was,
from that point,

04:34.633 --> 04:36.500
to extract saline,

04:36.500 --> 04:38.734
make the left side
with the implant smaller.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.734
I remember the surgeon
telling me

04:40.734 --> 04:42.767
he was going to take a needle
that was about 3 inches long.

04:42.767 --> 04:44.367
There was a hole in the valve.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.233
He had to get that needle
into the hole

04:46.233 --> 04:48.266
in order to extract the saline.

04:48.266 --> 04:49.767
So it sounded, you know,
nice and simple,

04:49.767 --> 04:51.400
but it was not like that.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.533
He had to literally fish
for the valve.

04:53.533 --> 04:55.100
It hurt, and he did not tell me

04:55.100 --> 04:56.667
it was gonna cause
that much pain.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.367
15 minutes in,
and he had not found that hole.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.400
I was crying.
I needed a break.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.100
And he stopped maneuvering
the valve

05:03.100 --> 05:05.000
and fishing with the needle
but left everything in place

05:05.000 --> 05:06.633
and just kind of

05:06.633 --> 05:07.767
let me lay there for a minute
and regroup.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.400
It was just--it was painful.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.000
It was horrible.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.633
After it being done,
I remember sitting up

05:13.633 --> 05:15.000
and looking in the mirror
and thinking,

05:15.000 --> 05:16.266
"Nothing looks different."

05:16.266 --> 05:17.667
If this wasn't gonna work,

05:17.667 --> 05:19.533
his option was
another augmentation.

05:19.533 --> 05:21.767
He had lost his marbles.
Like, there was no way.

05:21.767 --> 05:24.266
So I left the office that day
so angry,

05:24.266 --> 05:26.100
and I never went back
and saw him after that.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.000
I am nine years
out of surgery today,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.033
and my breasts are worse
than what I started with.

05:31.033 --> 05:33.433
I would rather not have
an implant in my left

05:33.433 --> 05:35.300
and have an A and D

05:35.300 --> 05:36.533
and be stuffing my bra
the rest of my life

05:36.533 --> 05:38.667
than to have this implant
in me,

05:38.667 --> 05:42.033
almost under my armpit,
with a valve attached to it.

05:42.033 --> 05:44.700
And I later found out
that valve should have come out

05:44.700 --> 05:47.133
a year after surgery.

05:47.133 --> 05:50.400
Over the past year,
I have made some life changes.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.133
I am newly a single mom.

05:53.133 --> 05:54.700
I have enrolled
in nursing school.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.433
But I still have
this one last issue

05:56.433 --> 05:58.133
that's kind of
out of my control.

05:58.133 --> 05:59.700
I reached out to Dr. Dubrow
and Dr. Nassif

05:59.700 --> 06:03.400
because I feel like I want
to be in the hands

06:03.400 --> 06:04.700
of someone
who I am comfortable with,

06:04.700 --> 06:06.000
who I can trust.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.667
I just want them

06:07.667 --> 06:10.033
to give me some sort of hope
that this is something

06:10.033 --> 06:12.066
that I can overcome
and put behind me

06:12.066 --> 06:14.000
and not ever
have to look back on it.

06:16.567 --> 06:18.467
- How did you do
on your trip?

06:18.467 --> 06:20.333
- Well, we took the kids.
- Where'd you go?

06:20.333 --> 06:21.700
- Aspen.
- Okay.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.700
- About 2:00 in the morning,
I wake up,

06:23.700 --> 06:25.600
and I start to feel
really nauseous.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.600
And I swear on my life

06:27.600 --> 06:29.066
what I'm about to tell you
is true.

06:29.066 --> 06:31.066
I thought,
"What would Paul do?

06:31.066 --> 06:33.166
Paul would go to the ER
and get an IV."

06:33.166 --> 06:34.467
- Exactly.

06:34.467 --> 06:36.467
- So we called
the paramedics

06:36.467 --> 06:38.467
to take me to the ER.

06:38.467 --> 06:40.734
The doctor says, "This is
acute altitude sickness."

06:40.734 --> 06:42.567
He said, "What's your nausea?"

06:42.567 --> 06:44.033
"It's a 12 out of 10.
It's a 12 out of 10.

06:44.033 --> 06:45.467
I can't take this."

06:45.467 --> 06:46.734
And he gives me
one dose of Ativan,

06:46.734 --> 06:48.033
and I say
it's a 7 out of 10.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.467
And he goes, "Okay."

06:49.467 --> 06:50.734
He gives me another dose
of Ativan,

06:50.734 --> 06:52.400
and all of a sudden,
it's a zero.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.700
And Heather has a video
of me.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.633
- He doesn't feel good.

07:00.633 --> 07:02.500
He got altitude sickness.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.467
- And you know what?

07:03.467 --> 07:05.333
With my sickness,

07:05.333 --> 07:08.100
I've strangely developed
the ability to speak Italian.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.600
Are you ready?

07:09.600 --> 07:13.100
I don't-a feel-a good.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.066
- The Ativan has kicked in.

07:15.066 --> 07:16.600
- Had it not been for you,

07:16.600 --> 07:18.367
I would have spent
another two hours

07:18.367 --> 07:20.367
trying to get better
on my own,

07:20.367 --> 07:22.500
so thank you for being a sissy,
'cause it really helped me.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.767
- I love being a sissy.
- Yeah.

07:23.767 --> 07:25.367
- Terry likes to bust my chops,

07:25.367 --> 07:27.066
but when push comes to shove,

07:27.066 --> 07:30.367
he's just as much of a wuss
as I am.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.100
What do we have,
my good brother of love?

07:32.100 --> 07:34.066
- So you remember Rajee?
- Of course.

07:34.066 --> 07:37.500
- We were concerned
about waking a sleeping dragon.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.667
- More granulomas, yeah.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.767
- The dragon...

07:39.767 --> 07:40.767
- Oh, Jesus.

07:40.767 --> 07:42.066
- Is awake.

07:42.066 --> 07:43.500
- Any time you operate

07:43.500 --> 07:44.533
on a patient with granulomas,

07:44.533 --> 07:46.400
especially on the face,

07:46.400 --> 07:48.133
there's a high likelihood
that they're going to come back.

07:48.133 --> 07:52.400
So it's no surprise to me
that Rajee is back.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.533
- Just bring her in.

07:53.533 --> 07:54.667
- Can you please send in Rajee?

07:54.667 --> 07:57.633
- I'm baaaack!

07:57.633 --> 07:59.633
- You are.
How are you?

07:59.633 --> 08:02.533
- I'm doing well.
Good to see you.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.533
When I first felt the nodules,

08:04.533 --> 08:06.533
I felt like, "Damn it."

08:06.533 --> 08:08.133
Like, they sent me off
with this beautiful face,

08:08.133 --> 08:10.100
and, like, I let them down,

08:10.100 --> 08:12.100
and now here I am again.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.233
I'm washing my face
in the morning,

08:14.233 --> 08:16.667
and I feel a little nodule.

08:16.667 --> 08:19.166
And I thought, "Okay,
I'm not gonna get worked up."

08:19.166 --> 08:21.433
You know, "Maybe it's nothing."

08:21.433 --> 08:23.700
I waited about a week,

08:23.700 --> 08:26.700
and the nodule had gotten
substantially bigger.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.567
- In one week.
- In one week.

08:28.567 --> 08:31.700
Now what I'm finding is, like,
there's little ones.

08:31.700 --> 08:34.700
- Okay, and these nodules
that you currently have

08:34.700 --> 08:37.000
are not getting larger
anymore.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.033
- No.
- Okay, that's good.

08:39.033 --> 08:41.533
The question is,
what do we do?

08:41.533 --> 08:43.767
Is it a significant
procedure, potentially,

08:43.767 --> 08:45.533
as it was before,

08:45.533 --> 08:47.000
'cause that was
really significant.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.100
- Oh!

08:48.100 --> 08:50.166
- I remember your anatomy

08:50.166 --> 08:52.166
like it was yesterday.

08:52.166 --> 08:55.667
So I know what the inside
of you looks like.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.166
- Wow.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.567
And I think
you're the only guy...

08:58.567 --> 09:00.200
- [laughs]

09:00.200 --> 09:01.734
- The only guy that has ever
admitted to that.

09:01.734 --> 09:04.066
- [laughs]
- "I know the inside of you."

09:04.066 --> 09:06.567
- Yeah, that wasn't
the best choice of words.

09:06.567 --> 09:09.433
- What causes them
to keep coming back?

09:09.433 --> 09:11.200
- Part of the problem

09:11.200 --> 09:15.066
is that I had to leave
some foreign body in there,

09:15.066 --> 09:17.033
because the concern,
of course,

09:17.033 --> 09:21.600
was that we would activate
the granulomatous response,

09:21.600 --> 09:23.734
the inflammatory condition.

09:23.734 --> 09:27.066
Obviously, we got away with it
for a period of time,

09:27.066 --> 09:29.567
but the immune system,
whose job it is

09:29.567 --> 09:32.066
to do surveillance
on this foreign body,

09:32.066 --> 09:35.166
decided to reactivate.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.467
What I'm hoping is,
if we go back in there,

09:37.467 --> 09:39.700
that whatever I left...

09:39.700 --> 09:41.233
- You can remove?
- I can remove.

09:41.233 --> 09:42.767
- And that'll be it?

09:42.767 --> 09:44.600
- Why don't we go in,
have a look,

09:44.600 --> 09:46.767
and see how inflamed
things are?

09:46.767 --> 09:49.100
And hopefully
they're in a place right now

09:49.100 --> 09:51.500
where they're sort of--we can
do something about it

09:51.500 --> 09:53.500
rather than having you
live like this again.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.633
Okay?
- Okay, it sounds good.

09:55.633 --> 09:58.500
- Right before
my 17th birthday,

09:58.500 --> 10:01.633
I went to my mom,
and I was like, "I want veneers.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.333
- They grind down your teeth
to nothing.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.200
- And that was $25,000.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.633
Thank you, Mom.

10:06.633 --> 10:07.767
- It's a war zone

10:07.767 --> 10:09.500
inside your face.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.633
- [gasps]

10:15.734 --> 10:18.567
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

10:18.567 --> 10:20.600
- Where was the first one
that developed?

10:20.600 --> 10:23.000
- Okay, so the first one was--

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
it was, like, right in here.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.667
- See, this one

10:26.667 --> 10:29.000
is pretty superficially located
in the skin.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.667
- And that's the one
that you--

10:30.667 --> 10:33.734
- By the way, this is exactly
where I was before.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.667
The good news
is that they're soft,

10:35.667 --> 10:38.367
they're not tender,
they're not inflamed,

10:38.367 --> 10:41.066
and they feel optimally ready

10:41.066 --> 10:44.100
to have another
surgical procedure, potentially.

10:44.100 --> 10:48.533
What we did before is,
we had a very well-defined plan

10:48.533 --> 10:51.000
that was based on
an experiment we did

10:51.000 --> 10:52.400
in the chin that worked.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.633
I just don't think
there's a reason

10:54.633 --> 10:56.600
to deviate from that plan.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.133
It was one thing before it was
injected with concrete.

10:59.133 --> 11:00.667
- Yeah, right.

11:00.667 --> 11:04.166
- Now there's all the scarring
from my surgery,

11:04.166 --> 11:06.700
it's even riskier
than it was before.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.433
- I see.

11:08.433 --> 11:12.533
- So mix concrete
with surgical scarring,

11:12.533 --> 11:16.133
and it's a war zone
inside your face.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.700
- [gasps]
Wow.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.100
Oh, boy.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.433
Rajee, you better get prepared.

11:22.433 --> 11:24.433
- Have you noticed your eyes
are sort of going down?

11:24.433 --> 11:25.567
- I did notice it.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.367
- So what I propose

11:27.367 --> 11:30.100
if you want to go down
this road with us again

11:30.100 --> 11:33.500
is to raise up the corners
and get those back up,

11:33.500 --> 11:35.700
'cause it's starting
to look like this, okay?

11:35.700 --> 11:37.567
- Sounds like
you're doing part two.

11:37.567 --> 11:39.500
- Yeah, I think
it's part two.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.000
- Part two?
- I'm just praying and--

11:41.000 --> 11:42.166
- Part two?

11:42.166 --> 11:44.166
- Let's part-two this,
all right?

11:44.166 --> 11:46.567
- Like, this third time
being the charm,

11:46.567 --> 11:48.533
I really do kind of believe it.

11:48.533 --> 11:52.200
Like, I think this might
just be it for my face.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.700
- Well, I just hope
that there's no surprises

11:54.700 --> 11:56.467
when I get in there.

11:56.467 --> 11:57.600
- 'Cause you know
I am full of surprises.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.066
- I know.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.066
- I'm a girl
full of many surprises.

12:01.066 --> 12:02.567
- I know.
- [laughs]

12:05.000 --> 12:06.467
- My name's Bryan Ray.

12:06.467 --> 12:09.033
My nose is the one thing
holding me back

12:09.033 --> 12:11.600
from looking like my queen,
Britney Spears.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.433
I'm happy with the tip
of my nose.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.734
It's cute, petite,
kind of feminine.

12:15.734 --> 12:19.066
But I really need my nose to be
a bit more narrow

12:19.066 --> 12:20.700
to look like Britney's.

12:20.700 --> 12:23.066
I grew up in Woodland Hills,
California.

12:23.066 --> 12:25.066
Whenever we would have
family get-togethers,

12:25.066 --> 12:27.500
I would make everyone sit
on the couch,

12:27.500 --> 12:30.066
and I would get up and just
start dancing and singing

12:30.066 --> 12:31.767
for my family and friends.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.433
And so that's when my mom
was kind of like,

12:33.433 --> 12:35.200
"I think
there's something here."

12:35.200 --> 12:37.066
And I started with dance class
and acting class

12:37.066 --> 12:38.767
and just performing ever since.

12:38.767 --> 12:42.066
Around 14 or 15 years old
is when it really hit me

12:42.066 --> 12:45.100
that I wanted to be a performer
for the rest of my life.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.200
And that's when I looked
towards Britney Spears,

12:47.200 --> 12:50.767
because at that time,
she was the biggest pop star

12:50.767 --> 12:52.433
in the world.

12:52.433 --> 12:54.467
Britney Spears
is the full package.

12:54.467 --> 12:56.700
She's sort of this, like,
girl-next-door sweetness,

12:56.700 --> 12:59.100
but she's also super sexy.

12:59.100 --> 13:03.100
And she has a smile that
literally lights up the world.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.633
It was about to be
my 17th birthday,

13:05.633 --> 13:07.600
and I sort of dropped the bomb
on my mom

13:07.600 --> 13:10.500
that I wanted to get a smile
that matched Britney's.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.000
I wanted veneers.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.467
And at first,
she was kind of shocked,

13:13.467 --> 13:15.500
as I think any mom would be.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.667
But she was super supportive,
and that was $25,000.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.133
Thank you, Mom.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.066
The results were unbelievable.

13:23.066 --> 13:24.667
It was like
I was a different person.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.600
I had totally been transformed.

13:26.600 --> 13:30.266
And I knew then that, hey,
if I could change my teeth,

13:30.266 --> 13:32.100
I could change anything.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.667
And I started with fillers
and Botox

13:34.667 --> 13:37.633
and laser hair removal,
chemical peels,

13:37.633 --> 13:39.133
And just anything
that I could do,

13:39.133 --> 13:40.767
I was down to do it,

13:40.767 --> 13:43.066
because I wanted to look

13:43.066 --> 13:44.500
like Britney Spears.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.100
When I was 21 years old,
I went to my mom,

13:47.100 --> 13:50.033
and I said, "I'd really love
to get my nose done,

13:50.033 --> 13:52.033
and I want it to look
like Britney's."

13:52.033 --> 13:54.000
And after the swelling
and everything went down,

13:54.000 --> 13:58.033
I just wasn't satisfied
with the complete result.

13:58.033 --> 14:00.233
The bridge of it is much wider

14:00.233 --> 14:02.700
than what Britney has
right now.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.266
I was approached to do
a little interview

14:05.266 --> 14:07.533
just about my look
and my transformation.

14:07.533 --> 14:10.000
I woke up the next morning,
and there's headlines

14:10.000 --> 14:12.033
around the world,

14:12.033 --> 14:16.000
"Man spends $80,000
to look like Britney Spears."

14:17.567 --> 14:19.300
Because of
all this media attention,

14:19.300 --> 14:21.667
I decided that it would be
the perfect time

14:21.667 --> 14:23.667
to do a world tour,

14:23.667 --> 14:25.700
so we're going to be
putting on a show,

14:25.700 --> 14:29.100
and, obviously, it's gonna be
centralized around Britney,

14:29.100 --> 14:30.567
but I'm also going to be
introducing

14:30.567 --> 14:31.700
some of my own music.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.600
Jonathan is my fiancé.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.300
We've been together
for 2 1/2 years--

14:36.300 --> 14:40.033
which, in the gay world,
is, like, 20 years--right now.

14:40.033 --> 14:42.700
And we are planning
my dream wedding.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.600
With everything going on
right now--

14:44.600 --> 14:47.200
planning my world tour,
planning my dream wedding,

14:47.200 --> 14:49.066
and, obviously,
I wasn't going to do

14:49.066 --> 14:50.600
what Britney did
for her first wedding;

14:50.600 --> 14:51.734
I'm not gonna go to Vegas--

14:51.734 --> 14:53.700
so now is the perfect time

14:53.700 --> 14:57.567
that I get my perfect nose
for my dream wedding.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.600
- The next patient has

15:02.600 --> 15:04.166
a very interesting problem

15:04.166 --> 15:06.200
that was treated
in a very interesting way.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.300
She developed a breast deformity
as her breasts were developing,

15:09.300 --> 15:11.333
one much larger
than the other.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.266
Look what it looks like.
Look how high it is.

15:13.266 --> 15:15.633
- That's submuscular?
- I don't know if it is.

15:15.633 --> 15:17.767
So why don't we bring her in--
her name's Brittany--

15:17.767 --> 15:19.367
and see what's going on
with her?

15:19.367 --> 15:21.700
- Absolutely. Will you please
send in Brittany?

15:22.633 --> 15:24.333
Hi.
- Hi.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.033
- Brittany, Dr. Nassif.
- Nice to meet you.

15:26.033 --> 15:27.233
- Who is this young lady?
- This is my mom.

15:27.233 --> 15:28.567
- Her mom.
Nice to meet you.

15:28.567 --> 15:30.166
- What's your name?
- Ronda.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.633
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Terry Dubrow.

15:31.633 --> 15:32.600
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.100
Have a seat, please.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.233
So tell us a little bit
about it.

15:35.233 --> 15:36.734
When did you first notice

15:36.734 --> 15:38.367
your breasts were
developing unevenly?

15:38.367 --> 15:39.367
- Probably when I was younger,
when I hit puberty,

15:39.367 --> 15:41.233
maybe about 12 or 13

15:41.233 --> 15:42.767
and I really started to look
for that first training bra.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.333
- Right.

15:44.333 --> 15:45.767
- So I thought, "Maybe,
okay, this is normal,

15:45.767 --> 15:47.567
and it'll even itself out
eventually."

15:47.567 --> 15:49.066
- Had you noticed
while she was developing?

15:49.066 --> 15:50.600
- No, because she was
very modest.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.166
She didn't come tell Mom.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.333
- I was almost a full C,
if not going into a D,

15:54.333 --> 15:55.567
on my right side.

15:55.567 --> 15:57.066
- Oh, really?

15:57.066 --> 15:59.233
- And I had maybe
a full A on my left.

15:59.233 --> 16:01.200
- And what did
the plastic surgeon recommend?

16:01.200 --> 16:03.400
- He recommended
that they implant the left

16:03.400 --> 16:05.233
and then that they reduce
and lift the right.

16:05.233 --> 16:07.200
- When there's a big disparity,
or difference,

16:07.200 --> 16:08.734
in breast size

16:08.734 --> 16:10.133
and you plan to do
an augmentation

16:10.133 --> 16:11.767
on the smaller side,

16:11.767 --> 16:15.100
you really almost always
have to do an augmentation

16:15.100 --> 16:16.767
on the larger side

16:16.767 --> 16:20.400
in order to achieve
symmetrical upper fullness.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.200
- When I addressed,
"Are they gonna look different?"

16:22.200 --> 16:24.266
he said, "What we could do
is put this valve in here,

16:24.266 --> 16:26.633
"and that would allow me
to adjust the size of the breast

16:26.633 --> 16:28.367
if we had any issues
after surgery."

16:28.367 --> 16:30.133
I still have the valve.

16:30.133 --> 16:31.633
- You're kidding me.

16:31.633 --> 16:32.667
Adjustable saline implants

16:32.667 --> 16:34.400
are only to be put in

16:34.400 --> 16:36.600
for a very short period of time.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.667
I'm actually really curious
to see what it looks like

16:39.667 --> 16:42.433
after this long a period.

16:42.433 --> 16:45.000
I think we should go in
and do an exam

16:45.000 --> 16:46.166
and see where you're at,
okay?

16:46.166 --> 16:48.033
- Okay.
- All right.

16:48.033 --> 16:50.300
- Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif
are my only hope

16:50.300 --> 16:52.233
of getting this breast issue
fixed

16:52.233 --> 16:54.133
and never, ever having
to look back

16:54.133 --> 16:57.033
or think twice about what was
or what could have been.

16:57.033 --> 16:58.700
It's only gonna be
what should be.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.633
- Put your hands on your hips
like this and push, flex.

17:01.633 --> 17:05.000
This side:
capsular contracture,

17:05.000 --> 17:06.433
upward displacement.

17:06.433 --> 17:10.700
No volume on this side
and a droopy breast, okay?

17:10.700 --> 17:14.133
Option number one is to just
take this implant out.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.033
If you take this implant out,

17:16.033 --> 17:18.700
you will have better symmetry.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.400
They will be
very deflated-looking.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.133
You'll have no upper fullness,

17:22.133 --> 17:26.133
and they'll be kind of
sad, pancakey breasts.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.033
That's the simplest
and least risky, okay?

17:31.033 --> 17:34.133
Option number two
is to take the left implant out,

17:34.133 --> 17:36.700
put a new implant in there.

17:36.700 --> 17:39.000
If we put a new implant
on the left,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.200
you have to put an implant
on the right.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.133
That's where I think
your surgeon missed the boat

17:44.133 --> 17:45.700
on this surgical misadventure.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.266
This one always needed
an implant.

17:48.266 --> 17:50.066
- But the valve.

17:50.066 --> 17:51.200
If I get silicone,
I won't have this thing--

17:51.200 --> 17:52.333
- You won't have that valve.

17:52.333 --> 17:54.066
By the way,
it's not meant for you.

17:54.066 --> 17:55.300
It's not appropriate
for you, and it's--

17:55.300 --> 17:58.333
for lack of a better term,
it's dumb.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.467

- Okay?

17:59.467 --> 18:01.233

18:03.367 --> 18:05.367
Well, there it is.
- Yeah.

18:05.367 --> 18:08.066
- There's absolutely no reason
why Brittany

18:08.066 --> 18:09.500

an adjustable implant

18:09.500 --> 18:12.700

for so many years.

19:09.667 --> 19:11.667
It was such a good year,

19:20.266 --> 19:21.266
- First of all, I want to say,

19:21.266 --> 19:23.266
this is never a great sign,

19:23.266 --> 19:25.567
when your chart's starting
to get really thick.

19:25.567 --> 19:27.000
- Oh, my God.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.033
- You're almost
a volume two, okay?

19:29.033 --> 19:30.700
Rajee's case, for me,

19:30.700 --> 19:33.033
has been sort of
the instruction manual

19:33.033 --> 19:37.033
as to how to deal
with these complex granulomas.

19:37.033 --> 19:40.567
And up until this point,
only a few doctors

19:40.567 --> 19:42.567
have really tried
to tackle this,

19:42.567 --> 19:44.433
so this is a really unique
experience

19:44.433 --> 19:46.300
both to help Rajee

19:46.300 --> 19:48.567
and potentially to help
even more people.

19:48.567 --> 19:51.400
So sort of surgical technique.

19:51.400 --> 19:55.567
Stay central,
stay deep but not too deep.

19:55.567 --> 19:58.000
Don't get too close
to the skin surface

19:58.000 --> 19:59.567
and cut off the blood supply.

19:59.567 --> 20:02.433
Don't go too deep and interfere
with the motor nerves.

20:02.433 --> 20:03.567
- Kind of right there
in the middle.

20:03.567 --> 20:05.266
- Right there, baby,
right?

20:05.266 --> 20:06.433
- Right where that--
[laughs]

20:06.433 --> 20:07.734
- Right.

20:07.734 --> 20:09.567
- We'll call it
the pleasure zone.

20:09.567 --> 20:11.433
- [laughs]
- Right there in the middle.

20:11.433 --> 20:12.467
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:12.467 --> 20:13.600
Okay, let's do this.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.033
Huh?
Give me a hug.

20:15.033 --> 20:16.600
I really, really like Rajee.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.600
We've formed a special bond
over the years.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.600
And it's sort of me
against these masses,

20:20.600 --> 20:22.200
so it's game on.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.467
Let's go for it
and get them out of there

20:23.467 --> 20:25.433
in a very safe, deliberate way.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.300
I will start Rajee's surgery

20:27.300 --> 20:28.734
by making incisions
in her upper eyelids

20:28.734 --> 20:30.600
and perform
a lateral canthoplasty

20:30.600 --> 20:32.600
that will raise the corner
of her eyelids.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.333
Next, I'll go through
her previous incision scars

20:35.333 --> 20:37.333
and elevate the skin
off her cheekbones,

20:37.333 --> 20:40.200
exposing the masses
and carefully debulking them.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.066
Finally, I'll perform
a face-lift,

20:42.066 --> 20:43.734
which will tighten her skin
and give her back

20:43.734 --> 20:45.533
the face she's loved
over the past year.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.367
All right, so we're gonna start
with the eyes,

20:50.367 --> 20:53.333
because I'm concerned
if we start with the cheeks,

20:53.333 --> 20:57.100
there'll be a lot of swelling
and it'll obscure

20:57.100 --> 20:59.100
the fine dissection
we need to do around the eyes,

20:59.100 --> 21:00.600
so we'll start there.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.367
Okay, so you make
an upper eyelid incision,

21:03.367 --> 21:07.066
and you dissect down
to the layer on top of the bone,

21:07.066 --> 21:08.600
called the periosteum,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.367
and grab the corner
of the eyelid

21:10.367 --> 21:12.066
and pull it up, take a stitch,

21:12.066 --> 21:14.467
and stitch the corner
of the eyelid

21:14.467 --> 21:18.233
to the tissue just overlying
the orbital rim up here.

21:18.233 --> 21:22.467
But Rajee's got
such a big, heavy face,

21:22.467 --> 21:26.500
I need to probably put
two stitches in here or three.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.533
Everything has to be
a little more robust with Rajee.

21:29.533 --> 21:33.133
These nodules weigh so much
on the center of her face,

21:33.133 --> 21:35.533
I have to do something
to establish

21:35.533 --> 21:37.533
a normal cosmetic appearance.

21:37.533 --> 21:39.266
Okay, the eyes are done.

21:39.266 --> 21:42.000
That was very straightforward.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.400
Hopefully, that will
portend well for the cheeks.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.367
Okay, so we'll start
by going through

21:48.367 --> 21:50.400
the same incisions
we used previously.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.500
So we're starting to elevate up
the skin now.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.667
- That's too thin.

21:53.667 --> 21:55.000
- Too thin?
Okay.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.533
- Getting too thin, yeah.

21:56.533 --> 21:58.266
- I'm more worried
about going too deep,

21:58.266 --> 21:59.400
but I just want to be
in the right plane,

21:59.400 --> 22:00.767
but there are no right planes.

22:00.767 --> 22:03.100
The usual anatomy
is obliterated here.

22:03.100 --> 22:05.667
It's sort of a chalky mess
inside here.

22:05.667 --> 22:07.667
It's sort of like cheese
when it melts

22:07.667 --> 22:10.266
and then it gets hard again
in the refrigerator.

22:10.266 --> 22:11.700
There are facial planes

22:11.700 --> 22:13.633
that are fused together
by a combination

22:13.633 --> 22:17.300
of previous surgery,
scar tissue from that,

22:17.300 --> 22:20.133
and the reemergence
of these active nodules.

22:20.133 --> 22:24.667
This is a completely different
operative experience.

22:24.667 --> 22:28.567
Main trunk of the facial nerve
has five branches.

22:28.567 --> 22:31.433
Everywhere Rajee has a mass

22:31.433 --> 22:34.033
is where each
of the main branches

22:34.033 --> 22:35.433
of the facial nerve are.

22:35.433 --> 22:39.166
This one is going
to the forehead.

22:39.166 --> 22:41.567
And if I cut the nerve
to the forehead,

22:41.567 --> 22:43.700
she won't be able
to raise her eyebrow.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.567
This case is dangerous.

22:45.567 --> 22:47.700
With Rajee's surgery,
my major concern

22:47.700 --> 22:49.433
is that I will hit

22:49.433 --> 22:51.433
one of the main
motor nerves in the face,

22:51.433 --> 22:53.467
which will leave her
with very significant

22:53.467 --> 22:57.033
facial paralysis,
which will be very disabling.

22:57.033 --> 22:58.734
That's very intimidating.

22:58.734 --> 23:01.600
Because it's
completely melted in

23:01.600 --> 23:03.333
with the surrounding tissue,

23:03.333 --> 23:05.600
there's no way
you can remove it.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.467
You have to just melt it.

23:07.467 --> 23:09.467
So, basically,
I'm cauterizing it,

23:09.467 --> 23:10.600
and it's shrinking it.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.734
Passing an electric current

23:12.734 --> 23:14.600
through these nodules

23:14.600 --> 23:17.200
is shrinking them
really nicely.

23:17.200 --> 23:22.166
So I've got a new way
of reducing these nodules

23:22.166 --> 23:25.467
and making Rajee's operation
work.

23:25.467 --> 23:27.467
So we elevated the corner
of the eyelids,

23:27.467 --> 23:29.467
removed the bulk of the masses,

23:29.467 --> 23:31.200
gave her a little bit
of a touch-up face-lift

23:31.200 --> 23:32.467

They pushed me away, girl,
but I have faith.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.066
I have faith.
I have faith.

26:05.066 --> 26:07.300
- I'm so excited.
- And they're cute.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.066
- Are they?
- Yeah, they're kind of cute.

26:09.066 --> 26:10.200
Like, Dubrow, yeah.
- Okay, I'm excited.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.300
- I feel it.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.300
[laughter]

26:16.300 --> 26:18.200
- Hi.
- Hi. Good morning.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.734
- My name's Brittany.
I'm here to see Dr. Dubrow.

26:19.734 --> 26:21.367
- Go ahead and sign in,

26:21.367 --> 26:22.633
and we'll get you taken
right back, okay?

26:22.633 --> 26:24.633
- Fabulous.

26:24.633 --> 26:26.333
I am definitely ready
to kiss the days good-bye

26:26.333 --> 26:29.633
of the tugging, the tucking,
the hiding, the pulling,

26:29.633 --> 26:31.633
just the uncomfortableness
all around.

26:31.633 --> 26:35.100
Those days are hopefully
gonna be long gone after today.

26:35.100 --> 26:36.767
- My goal today
is to maximize the symmetry

26:36.767 --> 26:38.100
in each of the portions
of her breasts,

26:38.100 --> 26:39.734
both upper and lower,

26:39.734 --> 26:41.500
and also to get them
to be raised up

26:41.500 --> 26:43.233
in a nice position.

26:43.233 --> 26:44.734
I have to address the asymmetry

26:44.734 --> 26:46.767
from the cosmetic surgery
she had

26:46.767 --> 26:49.633
and the asymmetry
from what she was born with.

26:49.633 --> 26:51.600
I need to work it.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.633
Brittany's surgery today
is all about symmetry.

26:53.633 --> 26:55.333
I'll start by removing

26:55.333 --> 26:57.633
the superiorly displaced
expandable implant

26:57.633 --> 26:59.633
from her left breast.

26:59.633 --> 27:02.100
Then I'll replace it
with a high-profile implant

27:02.100 --> 27:04.266
and proceed to the right side,

27:04.266 --> 27:06.233
putting in
an appropriately sized implant

27:06.233 --> 27:08.533
and perform a lift
on both sides

27:08.533 --> 27:10.400
to create mound symmetry.

27:10.400 --> 27:14.266
Let's go hunt down that implant
with that weird valve in there.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.100
Okay, so where's that valve?

27:17.100 --> 27:18.266
Here it is.

27:18.266 --> 27:20.133
So let's take out this implant,

27:20.133 --> 27:22.066
and let's see
what we're really dealing with.

27:23.266 --> 27:26.000
So here's the implant.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.667
Boy, I've never seen
an implant like this

27:27.667 --> 27:31.133
inside of a cosmetic breast.

27:31.133 --> 27:33.767
Look at this.
It's woven into here.

27:33.767 --> 27:35.400
So although
I have no trouble

27:35.400 --> 27:37.667
finding
the large breast implant,

27:37.667 --> 27:39.266
the fill tube and the port

27:39.266 --> 27:42.266
is in another part
of her breast tissue,

27:42.266 --> 27:44.133
and I can't find it.

27:44.133 --> 27:46.033
Here.
Ugh!

27:46.033 --> 27:47.700
I'm gonna have to dig
through this breast tissue

27:47.700 --> 27:49.033
to get this valve out.

27:49.033 --> 27:50.700
Look at this.

27:50.700 --> 27:54.000
What the hell is that?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.667
- I'm Jonathan.
- Jonathan.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.166
- Pleasure.
- How are you?

27:57.166 --> 27:59.033
- Nice kilt.
- Thank you very much.

27:59.033 --> 28:00.400
- So you're commando
under there.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.400
- It's 83 degrees outside.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.166
- I don't care how hot it is.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.700
I don't want your testicles
on my chair.

28:06.700 --> 28:09.433
- The key is to match
the right one to the left.

28:09.433 --> 28:11.000
This is not gonna be easy.

28:16.700 --> 28:18.767
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

28:18.767 --> 28:21.400
- Ugh, I'm gonna have to dig

28:21.400 --> 28:22.533
to get this valve out.

28:22.533 --> 28:24.500
Look at this.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.467
What the hell is that?

28:26.467 --> 28:30.000
Aha.
Aha!

28:30.000 --> 28:31.333
- Mm-hmm.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.667
- There we go.

28:33.667 --> 28:36.333
Okay. Whew!

28:36.333 --> 28:38.300
I mean, this inflatable implant

28:38.300 --> 28:41.300
with this really long fill tube
connected to this port

28:41.300 --> 28:43.467
is kind of like
Brittany's ball and chain.

28:43.467 --> 28:45.300
Kind of reminds me of Paul,

28:45.300 --> 28:48.033
something I've wanted
to get rid of

28:48.033 --> 28:49.600
for the longest time.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.600
Let's sit her up
and see what we're dealing with

28:52.600 --> 28:54.433
without any implant in place.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.533
So this is what Brittany
looks like with no implants.

28:57.533 --> 29:00.333
Now that Brittany's implant
from her left breast is out,

29:00.333 --> 29:02.333
I can see
what I'm really dealing with,

29:02.333 --> 29:04.333
and what I'm dealing with is
actually worse than I thought.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.467
She has very little
breast tissue on the left.

29:06.467 --> 29:08.433
She's very deflated, droopy

29:08.433 --> 29:09.767
in both breasts.

29:09.767 --> 29:12.367
It's gonna be
even more difficult

29:12.367 --> 29:16.066
to achieve symmetry, projection,
and balance on her chest.

29:16.066 --> 29:17.500
So we're going to put in

29:17.500 --> 29:20.633
a 500 cc ultra-high-profile
implant

29:20.633 --> 29:22.500
on her left,

29:22.500 --> 29:25.633
which she really needs
to give her upper fullness

29:25.633 --> 29:29.033
and fill out the laxing
in the skin.

29:29.033 --> 29:31.767
It's really important
and difficult

29:31.767 --> 29:34.066
to achieve symmetry
in someone who has

29:34.066 --> 29:36.767
completely different-sized
breasts, like Brittany does.

29:36.767 --> 29:38.600
Although you use
different-sized implants,

29:38.600 --> 29:40.600
you have to understand

29:40.600 --> 29:42.633
we also have different
soft tissue envelopes

29:42.633 --> 29:44.467
and different pockets.

29:44.467 --> 29:47.600
That compounds the difficulty
that much more.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.633
We've got a nice shape
on the left one.

29:49.633 --> 29:51.400
It's been fully lifted.

29:51.400 --> 29:54.000
It has a 500 cc implant in it.
I like it.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.667
Now the key is to match
the right one to the left.

29:57.667 --> 29:59.667
This is not gonna be easy,

29:59.667 --> 30:05.133
because the right one is so wide
and so flat and pancakey.

30:05.133 --> 30:08.333
How are we gonna narrow it
and give it projection?

30:08.333 --> 30:11.000
In order to figure out
what size implants

30:11.000 --> 30:13.400
to put in these uneven breasts,

30:13.400 --> 30:16.133
it's a combination
of years of experience

30:16.133 --> 30:18.500
and just a little bit
of guessing.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.000
Ultimately, I picked
a pair of implants

30:21.000 --> 30:22.133
that had a difference

30:22.133 --> 30:24.133
of about 305 ccs,

30:24.133 --> 30:26.400
and that seems to be right
for Brittany.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.000
I'm thinking that worked
pretty well.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.100
Brittany should be
very happy with this.

30:32.700 --> 30:33.700
- I have a great patient
for you.

30:33.700 --> 30:35.433
- Okay.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.700
- Bryan is obsessed
with a certain celebrity.

30:37.700 --> 30:38.767
- Okay.

30:38.767 --> 30:40.567
- And Bryan is on a quest

30:40.567 --> 30:42.166
to make his nose look smaller.

30:42.166 --> 30:44.033
So let's just take a peek.

30:44.033 --> 30:45.567
- Whoa.

30:45.567 --> 30:47.433
- Those lips have, like,
six syringes in them.

30:47.433 --> 30:49.433
- If I had to guess,
at this point, what celebrity,

30:49.433 --> 30:52.000
I would say Justin Bieber,
maybe.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.700
- Well, what's the whole
lip thing all about?

30:53.700 --> 30:55.567
- I don't get that,
so it must be a female

30:55.567 --> 30:57.033
they're trying to look like.

30:57.033 --> 30:58.567
I'm pretty up on pop culture,

30:58.567 --> 31:00.567
and this guy doesn't look
like anybody I know.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.767
- Can you please
send in Bryan?

31:05.033 --> 31:06.533
- It's Bryan, bitch.

31:06.533 --> 31:08.033
- [laughs]

31:08.033 --> 31:09.100
Now we know.
- Now we know who it is.

31:09.100 --> 31:11.133
Oh, it's Britney Spears.

31:11.133 --> 31:12.433
Okay, I can kind of see it--

31:12.433 --> 31:14.734
blond hair, big lips.

31:14.734 --> 31:16.200
Yeah, no, I don't see it at all.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.567
- I'm Jonathan.
- Jonathan.

31:17.567 --> 31:19.066
- Pleasure.
- How are you?

31:19.066 --> 31:20.667
- Nice kilts.
- Thank you very much.

31:20.667 --> 31:22.600
- Seeing Dr. Nassif,
I'm, like, gagging.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.467
He is so cute.

31:24.467 --> 31:28.066
- You are a celebrity...
impersonator?

31:28.066 --> 31:30.600
- Yes, I do Britney Spears.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.000
- How do you two
know each other?

31:32.000 --> 31:33.467
- I just was gonna ask that.

31:33.467 --> 31:34.567
- This is my fiancé.
- Oh, okay.

31:34.567 --> 31:36.600
Talk to me about the kilt.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.066
First of all, are you wearing
underwear under there, I hope?

31:38.066 --> 31:39.533
- I like to wear it
traditionally, thank you.

31:39.533 --> 31:41.133
- So you're commando
under there.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.033
- It's 83 degrees outside.

31:43.033 --> 31:44.600
- I don't care how hot it is.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.600
I don't want your testicles
on my chair.

31:47.600 --> 31:51.700
- Your chef was
Britney's father, right?

31:51.700 --> 31:53.000
- Yeah, Jamie.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.033
- Oh, my gosh.

31:55.033 --> 31:56.500
- So you know Britney.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.100
- Yeah, I know
the whole family.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.734
She'd come over for Christmas
a few times and stuff.

31:59.734 --> 32:01.100
- Britney Spears did.

32:01.100 --> 32:03.033
Wow.
- That is so sweet.

32:03.033 --> 32:04.100
Dr. Nassif,

32:04.100 --> 32:05.100
hook a girl up.

32:05.100 --> 32:06.166
Invite me over.

32:06.166 --> 32:08.100
I could totally see it,

32:08.100 --> 32:09.100
Britney and I sitting
at the table together.

32:09.100 --> 32:10.600
This is amazing.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.367
We're gonna be, like,
best friends.

32:12.367 --> 32:14.500
- When did the whole
aesthetic procedure start?

32:14.500 --> 32:16.767
- It was right before
my 17th birthday.

32:16.767 --> 32:19.567
And I went to my mom, and
I was like, "I want veneers."

32:19.567 --> 32:22.500
My mom kind of was in shock
at first a little bit,

32:22.500 --> 32:26.767
and then we saw a few doctors
and found the perfect place.

32:26.767 --> 32:28.567
And it was difficult
to find a doctor

32:28.567 --> 32:31.633
who wanted to do that,
because I'm so young, and--

32:31.633 --> 32:34.033
- And they grind down
your teeth to nothing.

32:34.033 --> 32:35.633
- Veneers are set for someone

32:35.633 --> 32:37.667
who's actually had trauma,
lost their teeth,

32:37.667 --> 32:39.266
or someone
with poor dental hygiene

32:39.266 --> 32:41.133
or the teeth
just don't look good.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.633
But you do that as an adult,

32:42.633 --> 32:44.066
not as a healthy kid.

32:44.066 --> 32:46.667
- My next procedure,
I was 20,

32:46.667 --> 32:48.500
and I went to my mom,
and I said,

32:48.500 --> 32:50.100
"I want my nose done."

32:50.100 --> 32:52.600
I just wanted the bridge
of my nose more narrow,

32:52.600 --> 32:53.767
like Britney's.

32:53.767 --> 32:55.266
Found a doctor,

32:55.266 --> 32:56.667
and that's when I got
my next procedure.

32:56.667 --> 32:58.133
- How did that go?

32:58.133 --> 32:59.500
- I just wasn't satisfied,

32:59.500 --> 33:01.133
and I kind of let it go

33:01.133 --> 33:04.000
and just sort of focused
on other things in my life.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.767
- Okay, so you've never had
anything else done to it yet.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.533
- I've had
only one nose procedure.

33:08.533 --> 33:09.633
- Okay.

33:09.633 --> 33:11.000
- And but then I've also--

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
I've done
a lot of other things.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.266
- Like what?

33:13.266 --> 33:15.133
- So I've done Botox
since I was 21,

33:15.133 --> 33:18.700
which my mom took me for that
for my first time as well.

33:18.700 --> 33:21.667
You're thinking, like,
"Who's his mom?

33:21.667 --> 33:23.033
His mom is so crazy."

33:23.033 --> 33:24.300
In my mom's defense,

33:24.300 --> 33:25.567
when I wanted to get it done,

33:25.567 --> 33:27.166
she spoke to me about it.

33:27.166 --> 33:28.500
I spoke to a therapist.

33:28.500 --> 33:29.767
She wanted to make sure

33:29.767 --> 33:31.700
that this was seriously
something

33:31.700 --> 33:34.533
that I was committed to
and it wasn't just a phase.

33:34.533 --> 33:36.700
And 15 years later,
I'm still as happy as ever

33:36.700 --> 33:38.300
with the decision that I made.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.266
What I really, really want

33:40.266 --> 33:43.166
is a new nose,
and I'm really hoping

33:43.166 --> 33:44.700
that you guys could help me
with that.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.300
- This area right here?
The bridge.

33:46.300 --> 33:47.700
Not the tip.
You're happy with the tip.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.500
- I'm happy with the tip.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.700
You know, some people say,
"Just the tip."

33:51.700 --> 33:53.166
I'm happy with the tip.

33:53.166 --> 33:55.033
So I want to leave that.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.500
- The best thing to do now

33:56.500 --> 33:57.667
is to get you
in the examination room.

33:57.667 --> 33:59.533
We can give you our thoughts.

33:59.533 --> 34:00.600
- Okay, great.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.667

Bryan's doctor
overall did a good job

34:50.233 --> 34:53.467
with the probable hump reduction
and osteotomies.

34:53.467 --> 34:54.767

right here where
the upper-level cartilage is,

when you fracture the bones,

take down a hump,
and you don't stabilize

35:12.633 --> 35:14.200
- Okay.

35:14.200 --> 35:17.467
- Right now, if you go

even me, who's done
thousands of osteotomies,

35:20.333 --> 35:23.133

again,

35:23.133 --> 35:24.400
here's what's gonna happen.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.266
First of all,
the asymmetry here

35:26.266 --> 35:28.133
in your lower part
of your nose

35:28.133 --> 35:29.767
is going to become worse,
and what's gonna happen is,

35:29.767 --> 35:32.100
one side will just go "psshh"
and collapse in.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.133
- Oh, my God.

35:33.133 --> 35:34.333
- So you have a high risk

35:34.333 --> 35:35.633
of having that happen
to you.

35:35.633 --> 35:38.133
So besides it
not looking great,

35:38.133 --> 35:39.400
your breathing will deteriorate,

35:39.400 --> 35:40.667
and guess what happens
to all that dancing.

35:40.667 --> 35:42.133

your guys' opinion,

43:17.467 --> 43:19.500
- I remember waking up
in the ER missing my whole lip.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.567
I don't want to look like this
for the rest of my life.

43:21.567 --> 43:23.133
I don't.

43:24.734 --> 43:26.433
- We have a gift for you guys.
Isn't that great?

43:26.433 --> 43:27.433
- Hold on.
Can I see it for a minute?

43:27.433 --> 43:28.500
There we go.

43:28.500 --> 43:30.333
- Is it weird that I think

43:30.333 --> 43:32.233
my wife's breasts look good
on Dr. Dubrow?

43:32.233 --> 43:34.600
- This is clearly
fatty tissue.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.567
I don't think
any plastic surgeon on Earth

43:36.567 --> 43:38.100
has ever seen this.

43:38.100 --> 43:39.633
- I'm so sorry.
