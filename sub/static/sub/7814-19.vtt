am I gonna have

to write you
a detention slip?

01:34.542 --> 01:35.542
Probably.

01:35.542 --> 01:38.375
No! You know I hate paper work.

Wow, Kick,
when did you do this?

I didn't do it,
but if the principle see this--

This is obviously
not my work.

Are you kidding?
It's got Kick Buttowski
written all over it.

02:43.917 --> 02:44.959
No, it doesn't.

02:44.959 --> 02:45.959
Oh, yes, it does.

02:45.959 --> 02:46.917
See, it's written right here.

02:46.917 --> 02:47.959
I'm being framed.

Framed?

02:49.083 --> 02:51.250

This is a marker cap.

02:51.250 --> 02:53.458
I would never use
a glittery red marker.

that she's got a new student

03:07.875 --> 03:09.917
And you know how I
hate paper work.

03:09.917 --> 03:11.625
And then you're expelled.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.792
Enjoy your last hour
of freedom, bucko.

03:14.792 --> 03:16.250
Of all the things I've done,

03:16.250 --> 03:17.417
I'm going down

03:17.417 --> 03:18.625
for the one thing
I didn't do.

03:18.625 --> 03:20.041
I've got to find out
who framed me.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.291
Could be anybody.

03:53.291 --> 03:54.959

03:54.959 --> 03:56.083
And that's why the sine wave

03:56.083 --> 03:58.667

in my soul.

Mr. Buttowski,

04:04.375 --> 04:07.500
I will not have you sleeping
in my class.

04:08.917 --> 04:10.417
That's better.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.375
Ms. Fitzpatrick,
can I use the restroom?

04:12.375 --> 04:13.500
I don't know, can you?

04:13.500 --> 04:15.917

04:15.917 --> 04:17.083
I mean-- Mm-hmm.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.875

04:18.875 --> 04:20.083

04:20.083 --> 04:21.542
How'd you get out of class,
Gunther.

04:21.542 --> 04:23.083
I told her I had to pee.

04:23.083 --> 04:23.875
Good excuse.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.000
No, I really have to pee.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.083
Focus, Gunther.
We need to figure out

04:27.083 --> 04:29.125
who would want to frame me
to get me expelled.

04:29.125 --> 04:30.834
The shorter list would be
"who wouldn't?"

04:30.834 --> 04:31.834
This is true.

04:31.834 --> 04:32.959
Well, think about it, Kick.

04:32.959 --> 04:34.875
Who has got a reason
to take you down--

04:34.875 --> 04:35.875
Today?

04:35.875 --> 04:37.125
Hmm.

04:37.125 --> 04:39.000

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
A minus.

if it's the last thing I do.

Wow, you just generated

578 joules
of static electricity.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.041
[electricity crackles]

04:58.041 --> 05:00.834
Nothing cooler
than static electricity,

05:00.834 --> 05:02.542
Finally calculated the reality
of string theory.

05:02.542 --> 05:06.083
And the only proof
is right here on this computer.

05:06.083 --> 05:07.792

05:07.792 --> 05:10.458
I will get you back if it's
the last thing I do.

05:10.458 --> 05:13.125
Okay, so it's either
Ronaldo or Kendall.

05:13.125 --> 05:15.125
Or Ronaldo and Kendall.

05:15.125 --> 05:16.125
Huh?
Look.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.583
Can I go to
the bathroom yet?

05:21.583 --> 05:23.709
Stay focused, Gunther.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.125
That was close call
with Buttowski.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.041
Oh, don't worry
about Clarence.

05:35.041 --> 05:38.166
So far, our little secret
is safe.
Aha!

05:38.166 --> 05:39.375
You thought you could
get away with it,

05:39.375 --> 05:41.875
but I found your red cap
at the scene of the crime.

05:43.875 --> 05:45.000

both have caps.

So what Clarence?
Is it really so bad
that we found love?

What? Love?

what do you want to keep quiet?

05:56.500 --> 05:57.834
How about nothing?

05:57.834 --> 05:59.458
I know you've been stealing
my pretzel rods.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.750
I keep count.
I bet if I went
into that corner

06:01.750 --> 06:03.125
I'd find some
chunky evidence.

06:03.125 --> 06:05.000
I didn't talk your junk,
pretzel boy.

And I know you're trying
to get me expelled.

Wait, if you didn't frame me,
then who?

I don't have much time left
to find out.

come out of retirement

to use the restroom?

Aah!

from that pretzel rod.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.542
Big deal.

07:12.542 --> 07:15.291
I think you lost something.

Ooh, why thank you.

And you left the cap
at your crime scene.

I, uh, don't know what
you're talking about.

No, not until after--

Besides, you're too short
to be Tina's double.

19:54.417 --> 19:56.125
They'll fix me in post.

19:56.125 --> 19:58.000
What's the matter?
You afraid I'll be
better than you.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.417
Better than me?

19:59.417 --> 20:01.041
Not a chance.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.625
Stop this nonsense.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.333
Do you even know who you are?

20:10.333 --> 20:14.458
Sometimes a princess
and sometimes a super spy.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.959
It's over Tina Sometimes.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.083
Maybe some day.

20:25.083 --> 20:26.417
But not today.

Tina Sometimes.

20:37.542 --> 20:39.333
[cheers]

20:39.333 --> 20:41.458
Aw, they cut out the best part.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.417
That's because you landed
on the camera.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.625
Oh, yeah.

20:47.625 --> 20:49.834
So who's gonna be
Tina's stunt double now?

20:49.834 --> 20:52.083
Meh, they got some
short guy in a wig.

20:53.834 --> 20:56.625
So you got your own character
on the show now.

20:56.625 --> 20:59.792
Maybe next time you're in town,
we'll find out who's better.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.542
I don't pass through
any place twice.

21:01.542 --> 21:03.417
I cruise in,
break a few things,

21:03.417 --> 21:04.500
then cruise right on out.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.417
Well, then there's something
we got to do.

21:06.417 --> 21:08.750
Yeah, something we must do.

21:10.041 --> 21:11.500
[both]
Woo-hoo!

21:13.333 --> 21:15.458
Ms. Sometimes,
I've come to date you.

21:15.458 --> 21:17.375
And I won't take
go away for answer.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.250
Ugh, fine.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.792
But my stand-in
does all my dating.

21:21.792 --> 21:23.709
Pick me up at 8?

21:23.709 --> 21:26.208
[audience laughs]

21:26.208 --> 21:28.041
