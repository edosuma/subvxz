00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
- You've been on this path
of self-destructiveness.

00:16.999 --> 00:18.999
You are f***ing up
your life.

00:18.999 --> 00:21.999
- Your mother asked me
to give you a job as a busboy,

00:21.999 --> 00:23.999
and that's exactly what
you will be doing again

00:23.999 --> 00:25.999
if you don't show
some respect.

00:25.999 --> 00:27.999
- I can tell when you've drank
a little too much 'cause you get

00:27.999 --> 00:29.999
a look in your eyes,
and you get an attitude.

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
- I was fine until you
started bringing it up.

00:31.999 --> 00:32.999
- Dude, what, seriously?

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
- Our engagement party's
coming up,

00:34.999 --> 00:35.999
and I would love
for you to come.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.999
- I'm hoping to actually
to talk to her

00:37.999 --> 00:39.999
at some point
before then.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.999
- Oh, yeah, you're dreaming.
That's not gonna happen.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.999
- How big are you gonna go?
- She's getting triple Ds.

00:44.999 --> 00:46.999
- A full C, small D.

00:46.999 --> 00:48.999
- I'm not gonna pay
for something that I don't like.

00:48.999 --> 00:50.999
- It's not what you want,
though.

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
We both feel like
you've just been

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
so extremely negative
lately.

00:54.999 --> 00:57.999
- These ass****s look
a lot like people

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
who used to be
my best friends.

00:59.999 --> 01:01.000
- Jax just got arrested.

01:01.999 --> 01:03.999
- Over a pair of sunglasses.

01:03.999 --> 01:06.999
- Sometimes you don't make
the right choices.

01:06.999 --> 01:07.999
- Stop acting like
you're the number one

01:07.999 --> 01:08.999
f***ing guy
in this group, man.

01:08.999 --> 01:10.999
I'm the number one guy
in this group.

01:10.999 --> 01:13.999
- Are you f***ing
kidding me, Jax?

01:16.999 --> 01:20.999
- ♪ You know
that it's our time ♪

01:20.999 --> 01:25.999
♪ These are the best days
of our lives ♪

01:25.999 --> 01:29.999

your glasses high ♪

01:29.999 --> 01:34.999
♪ This one's for you

01:41.999 --> 01:45.999

01:45.999 --> 01:46.999
- Ooh.
- Hi, ladies, how are you?

01:46.999 --> 01:47.999
- Hello.
- Ladies.

01:47.999 --> 01:49.999
- Ladies,
I have champagne.

01:49.999 --> 01:50.999
- Oh, thank you.

01:50.999 --> 01:52.999
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:52.999 --> 01:54.999
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:54.999 --> 01:55.999
- It's been really hard
for me this summer

01:55.999 --> 01:59.999
not having Ariana there
100% for me.

01:59.999 --> 02:01.999
Things with Shay and I
haven't been the best.

02:01.999 --> 02:03.999
I want my old friend
Ariana back,

02:03.999 --> 02:05.999
so I'm trying to salvage
what I can.

02:05.999 --> 02:07.999
Shall we try on some stuff?
- Yeah.

02:10.999 --> 02:11.999
Those are hot.
Those are really hot.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.999
- That--but just, like...
- Good Lord.

02:13.999 --> 02:14.999
- With nothing else?

02:19.999 --> 02:21.000
- You can see my nipple.

02:24.999 --> 02:26.999
That--that's, like,
how is this sexy?

02:26.999 --> 02:27.999
It's f***ing horrible.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.999
- This feels, like,
way too girly for me.

02:33.999 --> 02:35.999
I feel like inviting me
lingerie shopping

02:35.999 --> 02:37.999
is a little bit of Scheana

02:37.999 --> 02:39.999
sweeping our issues
under the rug,

02:39.999 --> 02:40.999
but we're working on it.

02:42.999 --> 02:43.999
- Are you gonna
get anything?

02:43.999 --> 02:45.999
- No, nothing fit.

02:45.999 --> 02:46.999
- I think this is--

02:46.999 --> 02:47.999
- I like that.

02:47.999 --> 02:49.999
- $100?
- Yeah.

02:49.999 --> 02:51.999
- That's just one shift
at Sur.

02:51.999 --> 02:52.999
- Hopefully my fiancé
likes it.

02:52.999 --> 02:54.999
- He's gonna love it.

02:54.999 --> 02:57.999
- Tom and I have not had sex
since we got engaged,

02:57.999 --> 03:00.999
so if there was ever a time
to be lingerie shopping,

03:00.999 --> 03:03.999
I guess it should be
post-engagement.

03:03.999 --> 03:04.999
- Has it, like, really
sunk in, though?

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
Like, you're engaged,
but do you realize,

03:06.999 --> 03:07.999
like, you're
getting married.

03:07.999 --> 03:09.999
- I mean, of course I've been
planning my wedding

03:09.999 --> 03:11.999
since I was, like, 12...
- Yeah.

03:11.999 --> 03:12.999
- But once we set a date,

03:12.999 --> 03:14.999
then we'll start looking
at locations, and--

03:14.999 --> 03:15.999
- Mm-hmm.

03:15.999 --> 03:16.999
- 'Cause all the people,
when they get engaged,

03:16.999 --> 03:17.999
they rush out and be like,
"Oh, my God,

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
be my bridesmaids, everyone,"
I'm like--

03:19.999 --> 03:20.999
- Yeah, I mean, Stassi
might be a bridesmaid.

03:20.999 --> 03:22.999
Oh, good Lord.

03:22.999 --> 03:24.999
- She's been texting

03:24.999 --> 03:26.999
and really trying to claw
her way back in.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.999
I mean,
I'm not there yet.

03:28.999 --> 03:30.999
- I know her and Kristen

03:30.999 --> 03:33.999
really want both of us
to go to Palm Springs.

03:33.999 --> 03:36.999
Kristen's friend Rachael
has a house out in Palm Springs,

03:36.999 --> 03:38.999
so Kristen invited
me and Katie to come out

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
and spend the weekend
with her,

03:40.999 --> 03:42.999
but then she screwed it all up
by inviting Stassi.

03:42.999 --> 03:44.999
- I know she realizes
she messed up,

03:44.999 --> 03:46.999
but I can't say an apology's
gonna change anything.

03:46.999 --> 03:49.999
I am nowhere near ready
to forgive Stassi,

03:49.999 --> 03:51.999
and it makes it
even more complicated

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
that now Tom's invited her
to our engagement party.

03:53.999 --> 03:57.999
Way to contribute.
Thanks, Bubba.

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
I feel bad because
I kind of laid into him

03:59.999 --> 04:02.000
the other night when we were
at the party.

04:02.999 --> 04:04.999
- Yeah, Tom was trying
to talk to Schwartz

04:04.999 --> 04:06.999
about what had happened
that day,

04:06.999 --> 04:11.999
and Jax kept trying
to interrupt, and Jax goes,

04:11.999 --> 04:14.999
"Stop trying to make yourself
more important than me.

04:14.999 --> 04:16.999
You're not more popular than me,
and you never will be."

04:16.999 --> 04:18.999
- What I heard,

04:18.999 --> 04:20.999
you and Sandoval were,
like, upset that night.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.999
- Wait, wait, wait.
Take it down.

04:22.999 --> 04:23.999
- I'm just saying--
- We weren't upset.

04:23.999 --> 04:25.999
- Jax told me is that...
- Right.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.999
- You guys were upset...
- He was upset.

04:27.999 --> 04:29.999
- Because Sandoval was like...
- Neither of us were upset.

04:29.999 --> 04:30.999
- "Why aren't we talking
about my band?"

04:30.999 --> 04:32.999
- Nobody wants to talk
about Tom's band.

04:32.999 --> 04:33.999
- I'm just--I'm just--
that's--

04:33.999 --> 04:35.999
- It's like if you got drunk
and, like,

04:35.999 --> 04:37.999
you and Shay wrecked a car
and he broke his leg

04:37.999 --> 04:38.999
and, like,
all of a sudden, like,

04:38.999 --> 04:40.999
"I want to talk about my band,"
or something.

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
It's like,
"Dude, that's f***ed up."

04:42.999 --> 04:44.999
- Shut the f*** up
about your f***ing band.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
- He's f***ing ridiculous.

04:46.999 --> 04:49.999
Jax is acting
like a f***ing fool.

04:58.999 --> 04:59.999
- When you just did that,
like...

04:59.999 --> 05:02.999
♪ Duh-dun, duh-duh, dun,
dun-dun-dun, duh, duh ♪

05:02.999 --> 05:03.999
When you went up again
like that,

05:03.999 --> 05:04.999
then go to the higher one.

05:04.999 --> 05:05.999
- Okay, cool.

05:05.999 --> 05:07.000
- Let's do it again,
mate.

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
f***ing love it.
- It's great, yeah.

05:13.999 --> 05:14.999
He's got it now.

05:14.999 --> 05:15.999
- I'm working on a Pump CD.

05:15.999 --> 05:17.999
It's basically ten songs

05:17.999 --> 05:19.999
composed, written,
and produced by me.

05:19.999 --> 05:21.999
It's pretty much
my greatest accomplishment

05:21.999 --> 05:23.999
I've done in my life yet.

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
I'm very ambitious
and talented in what I'm doing.

05:28.999 --> 05:30.999
I don't mean to sound
conceited,

05:30.999 --> 05:33.000
but I'm the white
f***ing Kanye West.

05:36.999 --> 05:38.999
That's great.
That's great.

05:38.999 --> 05:40.999
- Hello.
- Hello.

05:40.999 --> 05:42.999
- James creates
a lot of original music

05:42.999 --> 05:45.999
that really embodies
the ambience at Pump...

05:45.999 --> 05:46.999
This sounds great.
- Yeah, I know.

05:46.999 --> 05:50.999
- So Ken and I said, "Okay,
let's finance a Pump CD."

05:50.999 --> 05:52.999
You clever boy.

05:52.999 --> 05:54.999
Well, you look like a slob,
but you sound amazing.

05:54.999 --> 05:56.999
- Mmm.
Thank you.

05:56.999 --> 05:57.999
- Go ahead, sit down.

05:57.999 --> 05:58.999
- I'm so excited.

05:58.999 --> 06:00.999
- You're still doing
a song with Lala?

06:00.999 --> 06:02.999
- We're making the song,
but it's not going

06:02.999 --> 06:03.999
on the album, I've decided.

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
- 'Cause things are
a little complicated

06:05.999 --> 06:06.999
between you and Lala?

06:06.999 --> 06:07.999
Yeah.

06:07.999 --> 06:09.000
- Yeah.

06:09.999 --> 06:11.999
Lala and I got into it
a little bit the other day.

06:11.999 --> 06:13.999
Those are the days
you hit me up, babe,

06:13.999 --> 06:14.999
are the only days
you're f***ing lonely;

06:15.000 --> 06:16.999
you ain't got anyone else
to f***ing hang out with you.

06:16.999 --> 06:18.000
You're f***ing fake as f***,

06:18.999 --> 06:20.999
and you should f***ing learn
your lesson, babe.

06:20.999 --> 06:22.999
You know, part of me misses
Kristen at this point,

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
which I know sounds crazy.
- Oh, goodness.

06:24.999 --> 06:26.999
Really, yeah,
that does sound crazy.

06:26.999 --> 06:28.999
If there's something destructive
in your life,

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
you have to detach
from it,

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
and I've told you that
about your drinking as well.

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
- I really don't want
to let you down, Lisa.

06:34.999 --> 06:35.999
I want you to believe.
I want you to believe--

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
- There's only a few people
that give you a chance in life.

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
You know that.
Don't screw it up.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.999
- Yeah, and you're definitely
one of those people.

06:41.999 --> 06:42.999
- Well, don't screw it up,
then.

06:42.999 --> 06:44.999
- That's what I wanted to say,
Lisa, like, honestly,

06:44.999 --> 06:45.999
like, I know
that I've been like--

06:45.999 --> 06:46.999
- No, you don't
have to say.

06:46.999 --> 06:47.999
- I'm--I'm very grateful.

06:47.999 --> 06:50.999
- You thank me
by being professional

06:50.999 --> 06:53.999
and getting
this sh** done.

06:59.999 --> 07:01.999
- Dude, are you sure
about this?

07:01.999 --> 07:02.999
'Cause, A, it's painful,
it's really expensive,

07:02.999 --> 07:05.999
and, also, I think
the tattoo's funny,

07:05.999 --> 07:06.999
and it's a good story.

07:06.999 --> 07:08.999
It's like a nice
little "momento."

07:08.999 --> 07:10.999
God, I want him to

07:10.999 --> 07:11.999
keep that ass tattoo.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.999
That's, like, our thing.
That's our story.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.999
- Oh, my God.

07:16.999 --> 07:17.999
What the f***?

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
- I got one too.

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
What?

07:21.999 --> 07:24.999
- I want to be
ass tattoo brothers, you know?

07:25.999 --> 07:26.999
- Hey, what's up?

07:26.999 --> 07:29.999
- So I guess Jax
went to Scheana

07:30.000 --> 07:33.999
and said that we were,
"Upset,"

07:33.999 --> 07:37.999
because nobody else wanted
to talk about your band.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.999
- Are you
f***ing kidding me?

07:41.999 --> 07:42.999
- Shh, shh.
- No. For real.

07:42.999 --> 07:45.000
- Are you f***ing kidding me?
Dude.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.999
Jax is probably feeling
a little humiliated

07:47.999 --> 07:49.999
about all the things
that he said last night.

07:49.999 --> 07:50.999
- Cool, I'll talk to you
in a little bit then.

07:50.999 --> 07:51.999
- All right, cool.

07:51.999 --> 07:54.000
Instead of apologizing,
he's now on the offensive,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.999
try to make me
look like a douche bag.

07:56.999 --> 07:57.999
- Are you good to go?
- Yeah.

07:57.999 --> 07:58.999
Come with me.
- Okay, okay.

07:58.999 --> 08:00.999
- Way to take
responsibility, Jax.

08:00.999 --> 08:02.999
Way to be a good friend.

08:02.999 --> 08:03.999
- Hi, I'm Corey.
- Hey, I'm Tom.

08:03.999 --> 08:04.999
- Nice to meet you.

08:04.999 --> 08:05.999
This is the Tom
with the terrible tattoo.

08:05.999 --> 08:06.999
- Hello again.
Good to see you.

08:06.999 --> 08:08.999
- Welcome back.
- Yeah, take a seat, guys.

08:08.999 --> 08:09.999
- You know what
the number one reason

08:09.999 --> 08:11.999
for keeping
that tattoo is?

08:11.999 --> 08:15.999
That terrifying James Bond
villain-esque device.

08:15.999 --> 08:17.999
- Okay, Tom,
so this is the laser.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
- I mean, holy sh**.

08:19.999 --> 08:20.999
That thing is scary, man.

08:20.999 --> 08:21.999
- Would you like
to hold his hand,

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
or would you like to hold
the blue balls?

08:23.999 --> 08:24.999
- Blue balls?
- Stress balls.

08:24.999 --> 08:25.999
- It's gonna hurt?

08:25.999 --> 08:26.999
- Yeah, dude.
- All right.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
- We'll do a little test spot
first,

08:28.999 --> 08:29.999
just to see how you do,
okay?

08:29.999 --> 08:31.999
- Okay.
- All right.

08:31.999 --> 08:32.999
- All right, wait.
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

08:32.999 --> 08:33.999
- Okay, okay.

08:33.999 --> 08:34.999
- I got, like,
a cramp in my back.

08:34.999 --> 08:37.999
Hold on,
give me a second.

08:39.999 --> 08:40.999
All right, I'm ready.
- On three.

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
One, two, three.

08:44.999 --> 08:45.999
This time,
on the count of three,

08:45.999 --> 08:48.999
I want you to flex your
butt cheeks really hard, okay?

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
- All right.
- One, two, three.

08:50.999 --> 08:51.999
Good, good, good,
good, good.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
- Ow, ow.
f***.

08:53.999 --> 08:56.000
This is literally
such a pain in the ass.

08:56.999 --> 08:58.999
It feels like a rubber band
smacking on your skin...

08:59.000 --> 09:00.999
- Tell me if you need
a break.

09:00.999 --> 09:01.999
- Yeah, yeah, give me a break.
- Okay.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.999
- But a machine gun.

09:05.999 --> 09:08.999
- Very good.
Almost done.

09:08.999 --> 09:10.999
Perfect.

09:10.999 --> 09:12.999
Last little bit, okay?
Hang in there.

09:12.999 --> 09:14.999
Five, four, three,
two, one.

09:14.999 --> 09:16.999
- Yeah.
- That's it.

09:16.999 --> 09:17.999
- Dude, f***ing
knocked it out.

09:17.999 --> 09:18.999
- What do you think?

09:18.999 --> 09:20.999
- All right.
Yeah, it hurts.

09:20.999 --> 09:21.999
- All right, Tom,
so you're just gonna

09:21.999 --> 09:22.999
sit here for a minute.

09:22.999 --> 09:23.999
No drinking tonight.

09:23.999 --> 09:25.999
- All right.
- All right. Take care.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Bye.

09:27.999 --> 09:28.999
Dude, you did it.

09:28.999 --> 09:29.999
- Yeah.

09:31.999 --> 09:33.999
- I don't think you're
supposed to play with those.

09:34.999 --> 09:35.999
- This is what
I'm gonna do to you.

09:48.999 --> 09:51.999
- All I do is sit on your couch
and drink.

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
- Story of my life.

09:53.999 --> 09:54.999
- I, like, cleaned
really hard-core.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.999
- Will you just
stay here forever?

09:56.999 --> 09:57.999
- I might have to.

09:57.999 --> 09:59.999
I'm, like,
so good at squatting.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.999
Like, I didn't realize that
this was, like, a talent

10:01.999 --> 10:04.999
that I should have tapped into
years ago, you know?

10:04.999 --> 10:05.999
Squatting is legit.

10:05.999 --> 10:07.999
- I can't even talk
'cause I'm so stressed out

10:07.999 --> 10:08.999
about this comedy thing now.

10:08.999 --> 10:11.999
We've rewritten sketches,
and it's, like, in days,

10:11.999 --> 10:12.999
and I don't know
what I'm doing.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.999
- Oh, well.

10:14.999 --> 10:15.999
- Rachael
is the comedian.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
- I used to date someone
that was really into porn,

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
so I installed
a nanny cam.

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
Then I just had hours
of him beating off.

10:21.999 --> 10:24.999
- Typically I've done
more dramatic roles.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.999
Mom, he just wants
a visa, okay?

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
- Yes!
- Kind of gives an idea, right?

10:28.999 --> 10:29.999
- Yeah!
- Yes? Yeah.

10:29.999 --> 10:31.999
- I'm expanding my wings.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.999
And I have that one sketch
specifically

10:33.999 --> 10:36.999
where I have to be kind of,
like, Vegas ratchet,

10:36.999 --> 10:39.999
so last night, when we were
at Kyle Chan's party at Pump,

10:39.999 --> 10:41.000
I was like, "Scheana,
would you, like,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.999
teach me, help me,
and whatever,"

10:43.999 --> 10:45.000
so I invited her
to the show.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.000
I didn't even acknowledge
Ariana.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.999
Katie looked hot as sh**
last night.

10:49.999 --> 10:52.000
- Okay, well, I don't know
what to do about her.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.999
Any advice that anyone
could give me at this point,

10:55.999 --> 10:57.999
I'll take it.

10:57.999 --> 11:00.999
- I had talked to Katie briefly
about Palm Springs,

11:00.999 --> 11:03.999
and she just said like,

11:03.999 --> 11:05.999
"Honestly, Kristen, like,
if Stassi's going, like,

11:05.999 --> 11:07.999
"I'm just not ready to be
on, like, vacay with her yet.

11:07.999 --> 11:09.999
Like, I haven't even
talked to her."

11:09.999 --> 11:11.999
Katie definitely
needs a little push

11:11.999 --> 11:15.999
to talk to Stassi,
so maybe if I drag them

11:15.999 --> 11:17.999
2 1/2 hours
away from Los Angeles,

11:17.999 --> 11:20.999
lock them in a room together,
something good will happen.

11:20.999 --> 11:22.999
- All I'm asking is for her
to just listen to me,

11:22.999 --> 11:24.999
and if she decides
at the end of everything

11:24.999 --> 11:26.999
that I have to say, like,
"You know what, no,"

11:26.999 --> 11:27.999
then--then that's it.

11:27.999 --> 11:28.999
- I just don't think
that she--

11:28.999 --> 11:29.999
- I'm not expecting anything.

11:29.999 --> 11:31.999
- Right.
Yes, and I understand that.

11:33.999 --> 11:37.999
I feel like this can
all be cool again.

11:37.999 --> 11:38.999
We've all been through
so much together

11:38.999 --> 11:42.999
for so many f***ing years,
and if you can forgive me

11:42.999 --> 11:46.999
and Tom can forgive Jax,
it's like, "Come the f*** on."

11:46.999 --> 11:47.999
We just have to figure out
how to get you guys

11:47.999 --> 11:49.999
in the same f***ing room.

11:55.999 --> 11:57.999
- Kind of nervous.
- Nervous?

11:57.999 --> 11:58.999
- Yeah.

11:58.999 --> 12:00.999
My address,

12:00.999 --> 12:03.999
which, hopefully, we're not
gonna be there much longer.

12:03.999 --> 12:04.999
- Yeah.

12:04.999 --> 12:06.999
- I wish we knew exactly where
we were moving right now.

12:06.999 --> 12:07.999
- I do too.

12:07.999 --> 12:10.999
I woke up this morning--
I'm not happy...

12:10.999 --> 12:11.999
- Trust me, I know.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999
- With Hawaii,
you know,

12:13.999 --> 12:16.999
my friends, my job,
my relationship.

12:16.999 --> 12:19.999
- What do you mean
your relationship?

12:19.999 --> 12:21.999
- Well, I mean, this is--
this is new.

12:21.999 --> 12:22.999
- Yeah.
- So, I mean, I'm trying to,

12:22.999 --> 12:23.999
like, deal with this.

12:23.999 --> 12:26.999
Like, you know,
you just moved here, I...

12:26.999 --> 12:29.999
The last, what, two months
have just been such--

12:29.999 --> 12:30.999
whew.

12:30.999 --> 12:32.999
You know, I keep repeating
these things

12:32.999 --> 12:34.999
that I told myself that
I was not gonna do anymore.

12:34.999 --> 12:37.999
Get arrested, have petty fights
with my friends,

12:37.999 --> 12:38.999
you know,
rush into relationships.

12:38.999 --> 12:40.999
- You got to be
my witness.

12:40.999 --> 12:42.999
- I feel like I'm falling
back into some old habits,

12:42.999 --> 12:45.999
and I don't want
to go there.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
- Oh, I don't like
seeing you upset.

12:47.999 --> 12:48.999
It's hurting my feelings.
- I don't want to be upset.

12:48.999 --> 12:50.999
I feel like I'm a grown man,
and I'm just, like--

12:50.999 --> 12:52.999
I feel like I'm just
crumbling right now.

12:52.999 --> 12:55.999
I feel like such a--a pussy,
but I'm not happy at all.

12:55.999 --> 12:58.999
I talked to Shay last night,
and he's, like--

12:58.999 --> 13:00.999
I'm going through exactly what
he's going through,

13:00.999 --> 13:02.999
and I didn't even notice it;
he was just really upset.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.999
Him and Scheana have been going
through issues for a while,

13:05.999 --> 13:07.999
but I really didn't understand
what their issues were,

13:07.999 --> 13:09.999
and she's like, "Well,
it's drinking and this,"

13:09.999 --> 13:12.999
but drinking--something's
happening in your life

13:12.999 --> 13:14.999
for you to start drinking.

13:14.999 --> 13:15.999
- Mm-hmm.

13:15.999 --> 13:16.999
- So he's not happy.

13:16.999 --> 13:18.999
He's not happy
with Scheana.

13:18.999 --> 13:19.999
- Hi, are you guys ready...
- Hi.

13:19.999 --> 13:20.999
- Hi.
- To be taken back?

13:20.999 --> 13:21.999
- Yes.
- Yeah.

13:21.999 --> 13:22.999
- All right,
right this way.

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
- All right,
thank you.

13:24.999 --> 13:25.999
Babe, come on.

13:25.999 --> 13:27.999
- Feel free to take a seat
wherever you'd like,

13:27.999 --> 13:28.999
and the doctors will be
right with you.

13:28.999 --> 13:29.999
- All right.
- Thank you.

13:29.999 --> 13:30.999
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:30.999 --> 13:32.999
- Gosh.
- This is intimidating.

13:33.999 --> 13:35.999
Jax.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.999
I don't think you're
supposed to play with those.

13:40.999 --> 13:42.999
This is what I'm gonna
do to you.

13:42.999 --> 13:43.999
You know, five minutes ago,

13:43.999 --> 13:44.999
I was in a sh***y f***ing mood.

13:44.999 --> 13:46.999
But now?
Boobs.

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
Put me right in a great mood.

13:50.999 --> 13:52.000
You even make this
look good.

13:56.999 --> 13:57.999
- Hi.
- How is it going? Hi, Brittany.

13:57.999 --> 13:59.999
Hello.
- Brittany. Nice to meet you.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.999
- You know, the first thing
we generally ask people is

14:02.999 --> 14:04.999
what size you would
like to be.

14:04.999 --> 14:05.999
- Ooh.

14:07.999 --> 14:08.999
- Full C?
Okay.

14:08.999 --> 14:10.999
- We have a--our friend.
I guess--

14:10.999 --> 14:11.999
- Sarah.
- Sarah.

14:11.999 --> 14:12.999
- I think hers are
a little bigger, though.

14:12.999 --> 14:14.999
- To the left.

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
- So, yeah, I mean, that'll
put you well into the D range.

14:16.999 --> 14:17.999
- You want that look.

14:17.999 --> 14:20.999
- If you're comfortable
with that...

14:20.999 --> 14:22.999
- That's what you wanted,
right?

14:23.999 --> 14:25.999
Yes.
- So--

14:25.999 --> 14:26.999
- I mean, who doesn't love
big boobs?

14:26.999 --> 14:28.999
You know? It's a win-win
for both of us, really.

14:28.999 --> 14:29.999
She wins.
I win.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.999
It's not just for you.
It's for me too.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.999
- ♪ 'Cause baby
you're the bestest ♪

14:36.999 --> 14:39.999
♪ Baby, know that you can do
anything ♪

14:39.999 --> 14:41.999
♪ I believe in you ♪

14:41.999 --> 14:44.999
- See what you did to me?
Little sh**.

14:44.999 --> 14:45.999
- So you want me
to put on you?

14:45.999 --> 14:46.999
- Yeah.

14:46.999 --> 14:49.999
Salem scratched the sh**
out of my neck.

14:49.999 --> 14:51.999
- Jeez.

14:51.999 --> 14:56.999
- I don't know if you noticed,
'cause you were a little tipsy.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.999
I feel like we took
ten steps forward,

15:00.999 --> 15:02.999
and we've taken
a few back.

15:02.999 --> 15:05.999
When you drink,
you drink too much,

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
and I don't like having
to be your mother

15:07.999 --> 15:09.999
and tell you that,
so I usually just, like,

15:09.999 --> 15:10.999
let it go, because
there's no point

15:10.999 --> 15:11.999
in arguing with you
when you're drunk.

15:11.999 --> 15:12.999
- You don't let it go.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
You're the only one
who says anything.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.999
- And I'm the only who matters,
'cause I'm married to you,

15:16.999 --> 15:20.999
so if it bothers me,
it should bother you.

15:20.999 --> 15:24.999
Shay has already resented me
so much for so many things.

15:24.999 --> 15:29.999
I hope that he'll understand
I'm only trying to help.

15:29.999 --> 15:30.999
- The thing you do
that bothers me is just

15:31.000 --> 15:34.999
when you do mother me
when we are out and about.

15:34.999 --> 15:36.999
- Because I don't like having
a drunk husband

15:36.999 --> 15:38.999
who can't
take care of me.

15:38.999 --> 15:40.999
I don't understand how
you can't understand that.

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
What?
- Nothing.

15:43.999 --> 15:44.999
- No, tell me.

15:47.999 --> 15:48.999
It's just so frustrating.

15:48.999 --> 15:49.999
- What?

15:51.999 --> 15:53.999
- Obviously I'm unhappy
because, oh, I'm not--

15:53.999 --> 15:54.999
I'm drinking this and that,

15:54.999 --> 15:55.999
I'm a loser, I don't have a job,
like, all the--

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
- I've never said
you're a loser.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.999
- I'm not saying--but that's
how it's coming off,

15:59.999 --> 16:02.999
and that's what--
that's why I'm unhappy.

16:02.999 --> 16:04.999
- I want to fix this.
I want to fix you.

16:04.999 --> 16:06.999
- You can't.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.999
You can't fix everyone.

16:08.999 --> 16:10.999
- Okay, well,
now what do we do?

16:10.999 --> 16:11.999
Now what's our next move?

16:11.999 --> 16:13.999
What are you gonna do
for a career?

16:13.999 --> 16:17.999
- I'm pushing 30, and I just
bought a Sega Genesis.

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
That's who I am.
That's who I will be.

16:19.999 --> 16:22.999
I think it kind of sucks
that I'm still struggling

16:22.999 --> 16:26.999
and trying to prove myself
to my wife.

16:26.999 --> 16:28.999
When we have children,
I'm sure we'll go home.

16:28.999 --> 16:29.999
You know, and--but when--
- Yeah, no.

16:29.999 --> 16:31.000
We're gonna buy a house
back home...

16:31.999 --> 16:32.999
- Back home and raise our kids.
- Because we have two moms

16:32.999 --> 16:34.999
who are full-time
nanny babysitters.

16:34.999 --> 16:37.999
- Yeah, when we go back there,
I do want to teach and coach.

16:37.999 --> 16:39.999
- That's where our kids
will go one day, you know,

16:39.999 --> 16:42.999
and that Shay name will
never leave that school.

16:42.999 --> 16:44.999
Shay and I went
to high school together,

16:44.999 --> 16:46.999
and Shay doesn't like
living in L.A.

16:46.999 --> 16:49.999
I don't know that he's happy.

16:49.999 --> 16:50.999
- They don't make
great money, but--

16:50.999 --> 16:53.999
- I didn't marry you
for your money, clearly.

16:53.999 --> 16:55.999
My mom always said,
"Marry first for money

16:55.999 --> 16:57.999
and then for love,"
and I did opposite.

17:05.999 --> 17:07.999
- Do you want to help me
put some cream on my butt?

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
- Aw, did you just
kiss my butt?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.999
- Maybe.

17:14.999 --> 17:15.999
- Hey.

17:15.999 --> 17:16.999
- There you go.

17:18.999 --> 17:20.999
- Why do I feel like
I'm here to do work?

17:20.999 --> 17:22.999
- Because...

17:22.999 --> 17:24.999
I asked you to come
and do work.

17:24.999 --> 17:26.999
- This thing has
a lot of history.

17:26.999 --> 17:27.999
- Yeah, it does.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.999
- You know, it's actually
probably really good

17:29.999 --> 17:30.999
that we're getting rid
of this couch,

17:30.999 --> 17:32.999
'cause this couch knows
too much about our past.

17:32.999 --> 17:34.999
- He was at one end
of the couch.

17:34.999 --> 17:35.999
You were at the under.

17:35.999 --> 17:36.999
You guys started touching
each other's legs.

17:36.999 --> 17:38.999
You started sucking
his c***,

17:38.999 --> 17:39.999
he returned the favor,
and you banged.

17:39.999 --> 17:41.999
- So it's time for it to go.

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
Whoa, quarters.

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
- Oh, a remote.
- Remotes.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.999
- No joke, though,
the majority of this change

17:47.999 --> 17:48.999
and socks
are probably from me.

17:49.999 --> 17:50.999
- How many Sur bartenders...

17:50.999 --> 17:51.999
- Okay.
- Hold on.

17:51.999 --> 17:54.999
- Does it take to move
a couch out of an apartment?

17:54.999 --> 17:55.999
- Hold on, I'm stuck.

17:55.999 --> 17:56.999
Give me a second.
All right.

17:56.999 --> 17:58.999
- Yeah, if he goes real high,
we can get this.

17:58.999 --> 17:59.999
- Oh, sh**.

17:59.999 --> 18:00.999
- What's catching?

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
It's like the couch has
the curse of Kristen.

18:02.999 --> 18:03.999
It doesn't want to leave.

18:05.999 --> 18:06.999
That was my workout
for the day.

18:08.999 --> 18:10.999
- You all right?
- Yeah.

18:10.999 --> 18:11.999
- Whew.
- Whew.

18:11.999 --> 18:12.999
- Whew.

18:12.999 --> 18:13.999
- Whew.
- Oh.

18:15.999 --> 18:18.999
- I was, uh,
lingerie shopping,

18:18.999 --> 18:22.999
and Scheana told me
that you told her

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
that Tom and I were upset
the other night

18:25.999 --> 18:28.999
because Tom wanted
to talk about his band.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.999
- Which is 100% not true, Jax.

18:30.999 --> 18:32.999
- I walked out
of the kitchen--

18:32.999 --> 18:34.999
- Just own it.

18:34.999 --> 18:35.999
- I am being true.
This is--

18:35.999 --> 18:36.999
I am being
completely honest,

18:36.999 --> 18:38.999
and I swear on my life
that is what happened!

18:38.999 --> 18:39.999
- No.

18:39.999 --> 18:40.999
- I heard it
with my own ears.

18:40.999 --> 18:42.999
That is what started it.

18:42.999 --> 18:44.999
I completely remember this
happening in my head.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.999
- Jax, you are literally
acting like

18:46.999 --> 18:47.999
you had just had
a f***ing lobotomy.

18:47.999 --> 18:49.999
- Oh, dude,
you're welcome

18:49.999 --> 18:50.999
for f***ing helping
with your goddamn couch.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.999
- Thanks?
- All right, so should I

18:52.999 --> 18:53.999
bring up all the things
I've done for you?

18:53.999 --> 18:54.999
- I'm having my own issues
right now.

18:54.999 --> 18:56.999
- Stop making everybody
look like sh**

18:56.999 --> 18:57.999
because you're
too much of a pussy

18:57.999 --> 18:59.999
to admit to your
f***ing wrongdoings.

18:59.999 --> 19:00.999
- I'm not wrong.

19:00.999 --> 19:02.999
I think Tom's
influenced by Ariana,

19:02.999 --> 19:04.999
because most of the time,
Tom Sandoval is just

19:04.999 --> 19:08.000
generally a mellow guy,
but when Ariana's around,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.999
he definitely makes situations
bigger than they are.

19:10.999 --> 19:13.999
- I'm a f***ing badass f***ing
friend to all my friends.

19:13.999 --> 19:14.999
I f***ing take care of 'em.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.999
I do whatever
they f***ing need.

19:16.999 --> 19:19.000
I never f***ing stab 'em
in the back ever.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.999
- Oh, Lord.

19:20.999 --> 19:22.999
- And you guys f***ing
talk sh** about me

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
like I'm a backstabbing
selfish piece of sh**.

19:24.999 --> 19:28.999
You, Scheana,
f***ing everybody!

19:28.999 --> 19:31.000
- I can't.

19:31.999 --> 19:32.999
- f*** you, man.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.999
Let's get inside.
I got things to do.

19:39.999 --> 19:41.999
- You heard about what happened
at Pump?

19:41.999 --> 19:42.999
- No, what happened
at Pump?

19:42.999 --> 19:44.999
- Richardson and James
got into an altercation.

19:55.999 --> 19:56.999
- I don't know who's
more excited, you or me.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.999
- I'm gonna bury my head
in those damn things.

20:02.999 --> 20:03.999
- I'm a little scared;
I mean,

20:03.999 --> 20:06.000
I've only been dating Brittany
for three months now,

20:06.999 --> 20:08.999
and this is, like,
a permanent thing.

20:08.999 --> 20:09.999
Throw some Ds
on that bitch.

20:09.999 --> 20:12.999
Whoo-hoo!

20:12.999 --> 20:13.999
I mean, it's like when
you get your pants altered.

20:13.999 --> 20:14.999
There's no returns.

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
Did you call your mom?

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
- Yeah.
I called her on the way here.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
She's excited
and nervous.

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
- Now you're gonna have
big boobs to match that booty.

20:21.999 --> 20:22.999
- I know,
but I'm nervous.

20:22.999 --> 20:24.999
- Don't be nervous.

20:24.999 --> 20:25.999
- How many times
have you been here?

20:25.999 --> 20:26.999
Like...
- A handful.

20:26.999 --> 20:27.999
- Yeah, it's all finished.

20:31.999 --> 20:32.999
- No.

20:32.999 --> 20:33.999
- I come here a lot
for my Botox,

20:33.999 --> 20:35.999
but I--for surgery?
Three times.

20:35.999 --> 20:37.999
- You don't need
to keep doing stuff.

20:37.999 --> 20:39.000
- I know, but I like it.
It's preventative.

20:39.999 --> 20:40.000
Oh, there they are.

20:40.999 --> 20:41.999
- Hi.
- Good morning.

20:41.999 --> 20:42.999
- You just get better looking
every time I see you.

20:42.999 --> 20:43.999
- Okay.

20:43.999 --> 20:45.999
- You excited?
- Yeah.

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
- I was just telling her I'm
ready to throw some Ds on this.

20:48.999 --> 20:49.999
- Let's get this started.

20:51.999 --> 20:52.999
- Oh, this
is so nerve-wracking.

20:52.999 --> 20:53.999
- Just relax.

20:53.999 --> 20:55.999
Before you know it,
we'll be done.

20:55.999 --> 20:56.999
- All right.
- Okay.

20:56.999 --> 20:57.999
- Sleep well.

20:57.999 --> 20:59.999
All right, guys,
let's rock and roll.

20:59.999 --> 21:00.999
Thank you, sir.

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
- Glove?
- Yes.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.999
- This is bigger
than what we normally put in.

21:09.999 --> 21:11.999
I think they both
will be happy.

21:11.999 --> 21:13.999
- The Ds were not
in our original plan,

21:13.999 --> 21:16.999
but no one's ever regretted
buying a 70-inch TV, you know?

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
No one's said, "Damn it, I wish
I would have got the 40-inch."

21:18.999 --> 21:21.999
So it's go big or go home.

21:25.999 --> 21:26.999
What's up, Boobs McGee?

21:27.000 --> 21:27.999
- Don't make me laugh.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.999
I'm not.

21:29.999 --> 21:31.999
I mean, I guess you could
call me Santa Claus.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.999
Handing out little gifts
here and there.

21:34.999 --> 21:36.999
- ♪ He bought me flowers ♪

21:36.999 --> 21:40.999
♪ He callin' and we talked
and talked for hours ♪

21:40.999 --> 21:42.999
♪ He had me at hello ♪

21:42.999 --> 21:44.999
- How you feeling?
- Can I have a shot?

21:44.999 --> 21:46.999
- Want to go party?
- Yeah.

21:58.999 --> 21:59.999
- Hi, Peter.
- Who is that?

21:59.999 --> 22:01.000
- Lala.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.999
- Lala? I can't see you.
Oh, there you are.

22:02.999 --> 22:04.999
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing?

22:04.999 --> 22:05.999
How's it going?

22:05.999 --> 22:06.999
- Good.
How are you?

22:06.999 --> 22:07.999
- I'm good.

22:07.999 --> 22:08.999
- We're busy tonight.

22:08.999 --> 22:09.999
- I know.
- We like that.

22:09.999 --> 22:10.999
- That's why I'm, like,
here early.

22:10.999 --> 22:12.999
How's everything?
- Good.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.999
I--I've taken up
reading books.

22:14.999 --> 22:15.999
- Okay.
- So...

22:15.999 --> 22:17.999
Yeah, I love it.

22:17.999 --> 22:18.999
- Oh, good.
All right.

22:18.999 --> 22:20.999
- I was given a book
called "Fountainhead,"

22:20.999 --> 22:21.999
which is by Ayn Rand.

22:21.999 --> 22:23.999
It's a philosophical book,

22:23.999 --> 22:27.999
and it's about architecture
and architects.

22:27.999 --> 22:30.999
It's amazing
what I accomplish now

22:30.999 --> 22:34.999
that I'm not focused on
a skinny little string bean DJ.

22:34.999 --> 22:36.999
- You heard about what happened
at Pump, right?

22:36.999 --> 22:37.999
- No, what happened
at Pump?

22:37.999 --> 22:39.999
- Well, I heard that
Richardson and James

22:39.999 --> 22:40.999
got into an altercation.

22:40.999 --> 22:42.999
- When I work, I work hard.
- Well, I know that.

22:42.999 --> 22:44.999
- He works more than me, and
I'm still beating him.

22:44.999 --> 22:45.999
That's why you're my head guy.

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
- This happened
last night, actually.

22:47.999 --> 22:48.999
- Was he drunk?
Like, I don't understand.

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
- I think so.
Kristen had come in.

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
James was professing
his love to Kristen.

22:52.999 --> 22:53.999
- Over the weekend?
- Yeah, yeah.

22:53.999 --> 22:56.999
- I was not surprised to hear
that Kristen was there,

22:56.999 --> 22:59.999
because for some reason,
she loves to throw gas

22:59.999 --> 23:02.999
on a f***ing flame
and then let that sh** burn.

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
See, and I told him this
a thousand times,

23:04.999 --> 23:07.999
because he's already professed
his to love me.

23:07.999 --> 23:10.000
I'm like, "You don't"--
- James talks a lot.

23:10.999 --> 23:11.999
- No, I get it.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.999
The drinking, I think,
is why he flies off the--

23:13.999 --> 23:14.999
- Hello.

23:14.999 --> 23:15.999
- Hey.
- Well, hi, Lisa.

23:15.999 --> 23:16.999
- What's going on?

23:16.999 --> 23:18.999
- Look at--you look
so pretty.

23:18.999 --> 23:19.999
- Well, so do you.
Ditto.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.999
- We were talking
about a little incident

23:21.999 --> 23:23.999
that happened at Pump.

23:23.999 --> 23:26.999
- Oh, I've already heard
rumblings about that, yes.

23:26.999 --> 23:28.999
What do you know?

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
- I heard that James was
verbally assaulting Richardson,

23:30.999 --> 23:31.999
like,
"I'm better than you.

23:31.999 --> 23:33.999
You're gonna always
stay a server."

23:33.999 --> 23:34.999
- That makes me so mad.

23:34.999 --> 23:36.999
- Yeah.
- You have no idea how mad.

23:36.999 --> 23:37.999
- He does that, though,
Lisa, when he drinks.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.999
- Stupid, stupid boy.

23:40.999 --> 23:41.999
This stops right here.

23:41.999 --> 23:43.999
Just like when Kristen
talked badly to Diana.

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
I will not tolerate that.

23:45.999 --> 23:47.999
- Leave right now.
- Diana, f***ing walk away!

23:47.999 --> 23:48.999
You don't own the restaurant.
Move your ass.

23:48.999 --> 23:49.999
- Kristen.
- Leave.

23:49.999 --> 23:51.999
- Suck a dick.

23:51.999 --> 23:52.999
- Don't f*** with my staff.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.999
- It was because Kristen
came in.

23:54.999 --> 23:55.999
He was, like, you know,
saying that,

23:55.999 --> 23:56.999
"Oh, I love you, Kristen,"
and--

23:56.999 --> 23:58.999
- In my opinion,
it's better

23:58.999 --> 23:59.999
if they're never
even in the same--

23:59.999 --> 24:00.999
- Vicinity.
- Situ--yeah, yeah.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.999
- They're--it's just
a toxic relationship.

24:02.999 --> 24:03.999
- Yeah.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.999
James has to be responsible
for his own actions.

24:05.999 --> 24:08.999
I don't care
if Kristen's the catalyst.

24:08.999 --> 24:10.999
He can't blame it
on anybody else.

24:10.999 --> 24:11.999
- Well, what--

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
- So you haven't spoken
to James?

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
- No, I haven't spoken
to James or Richardson,

24:15.999 --> 24:16.999
but I'm going to.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.999
Richardson's worked
for us for years,

24:18.999 --> 24:21.999
and he is my right hand
at Pump,

24:21.999 --> 24:22.999
and I think
what he's achieved

24:22.999 --> 24:25.999
and who he is
is not gonna be disrespected

24:25.999 --> 24:28.999
by a little pip-squeak
like James Kennedy.

24:28.999 --> 24:29.999
I'm gonna haul him
over the coals.

24:29.999 --> 24:31.999
So I'll keep you informed...

24:31.999 --> 24:33.999
- Peter, as to what
we're gonna do

24:33.999 --> 24:34.999
with James regarding here,
okay?

24:34.999 --> 24:35.999
- Yes, ma'am.
Sounds good.

24:35.999 --> 24:37.999
- All right?
I'll see you later.

24:37.999 --> 24:38.999
- All right.
- Okay. Bye, Lisa.

24:38.999 --> 24:39.999
- Bye.

24:45.999 --> 24:46.999
- You got to take me
to the bathroom.

24:46.999 --> 24:48.000
- Ready?
- All right.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.999
No, you can't grab my arms,
honey.

24:49.999 --> 24:50.999
You got to, like,
push my back up.

24:50.999 --> 24:51.999
- Okay.
Just pull your legs?

24:51.999 --> 24:53.999
- No! Don't joke.
- Oh.

24:53.999 --> 24:55.999
I'm gonna see things
in this relationship

24:55.999 --> 24:56.999
that I haven't seen yet.

24:56.999 --> 24:57.999
- Don't hit your shoulders

24:57.999 --> 25:00.999
or your big ole noggin
on my boobs.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.000
- We're gonna get
real comfortable real quick.

25:02.999 --> 25:03.999
- All right,
I got to pee.

25:03.999 --> 25:05.999
- This is serious boyfriend duty
right now.

25:05.999 --> 25:06.999
I'm gonna
have to help her pee.

25:06.999 --> 25:07.999
I'm gonna
have to help her change.

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
I'm gonna
have to help her eat.

25:08.999 --> 25:11.999
Is that enough,
or you need a lot more?

25:11.999 --> 25:12.999
- No, that's good.

25:12.999 --> 25:14.999
- Here.

25:14.999 --> 25:15.999
I've held girls' hair back
when they're puking.

25:15.999 --> 25:18.999
I'm pretty good at that.
I guess it's all part of it.

25:18.999 --> 25:19.999
Hi.

25:19.999 --> 25:21.999
- Hi.
- Hey, Brittany.

25:21.999 --> 25:23.999
- I would get up
and give you a hug.

25:23.999 --> 25:25.000
I'll give you, like--
I can't lift my arms

25:25.999 --> 25:26.999
above a certain degree.

25:26.999 --> 25:27.999
- You got boobies.

25:27.999 --> 25:29.999
- I'm a proud father.
- I know.

25:29.999 --> 25:30.999
- We got boobs.

25:30.999 --> 25:32.999
Can't wait to put my face
in them, though, I'm excited.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.999
- You and Sarah should,
like, stand in the mirror

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
and, like, compare.
- I will.

25:36.999 --> 25:37.999
- I mean, I'll be the judge.
I can watch.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.999
Uh--

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
- No.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
Cold day in hell.

25:44.999 --> 25:45.999
Are you coming to the beach
tomorrow?

25:45.999 --> 25:47.999
- Yes, I am.

25:47.999 --> 25:49.999
- We're doing
our engagement photos.

25:49.999 --> 25:50.999
- I know.
I wish I could go.

25:50.999 --> 25:52.999
- I don't understand
why everyone's going.

25:52.999 --> 25:53.999
This is something, like,
the two of--

25:53.999 --> 25:54.999
- Just to hang out on the beach.
- Oh, yeah.

25:54.999 --> 25:55.999
- Well, 'cause we were
gonna have, like,

25:55.999 --> 25:56.999
a beach party with everyone
afterwards.

25:56.999 --> 25:58.999
Invited everyone
that we work with

25:58.999 --> 26:00.999
to come out because
I got so much sh**

26:00.999 --> 26:03.999
for, like, not inviting
or uninviting or whatever I did.

26:03.999 --> 26:06.999
Lala and I have both been
involved in an escalating series

26:06.999 --> 26:09.999
of just specifically not
inviting each other to things,

26:09.999 --> 26:11.999
so I'm just gonna
put an end to that

26:11.999 --> 26:12.999
because there's
a big body of water

26:12.999 --> 26:15.999
that I could just chuck her into
if she gets out of line.

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
I know, like,
he's, like, dreading

26:17.999 --> 26:18.999
the whole engagement picture
thing.

26:20.999 --> 26:21.999
- It'll be fun,
I mean, yeah, again,

26:21.999 --> 26:22.999
like, three of us
and then Courtney--

26:22.999 --> 26:23.999
- I don't need to be there.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
- Okay, well, when you have,
like, a really,

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
like, pessimistic attitude
about it,

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
if you put that energy
out there--

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
- It's not pessimistic.
It's realistic.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
I always told myself I wasn't
gonna do engagement photos.

26:33.999 --> 26:36.999
I mean, I don't want
to be that guy

26:36.999 --> 26:39.999
standing behind his girlfriend
on the beach like this,

26:39.999 --> 26:41.999
the cheesy smile;
I can't do it.

26:41.999 --> 26:44.999
I can't do it.
I won't do it.

26:44.999 --> 26:45.999
One last thing.
- What?

26:45.999 --> 26:47.999
- Did you name 'em yet?
- Not yet.

26:47.999 --> 26:48.999
- He's gotta wait
till he sees 'em first.

26:48.999 --> 26:50.999
- Yeah.
- It's like a new toy.

26:50.999 --> 26:51.999
- You gotta see the baby
before you name it.

26:51.999 --> 26:52.999
- Yeah.

26:54.999 --> 26:55.999
- You said,
"You're nothing.

26:55.999 --> 26:56.999
I'm James Kennedy."

26:56.999 --> 26:59.999
- That's ****
disrespectful.

27:06.999 --> 27:08.999
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:08.999 --> 27:09.999
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:09.999 --> 27:10.999
- Hi.

27:10.999 --> 27:11.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:11.999 --> 27:12.999
- What's going on?
- Hey, guys.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.999
- Hi, guys.

27:14.999 --> 27:15.999
- Good seeing you.
- Hey.

27:15.999 --> 27:17.000
- Do you want to,
like, chat

27:17.999 --> 27:18.999
about what exactly
it is you want?

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
- Okay, first in the water,
me pulling him out,

27:20.999 --> 27:23.999
reminiscent
of "The Sandlot" movie

27:23.999 --> 27:25.999
in the scene where Squints
pretends to drown,

27:25.999 --> 27:27.999
and Wendy's, like, giving him,
like, mouth-to-mouth,

27:27.999 --> 27:29.999
and then he, like,
grabs her head.

27:29.999 --> 27:31.999
- I don't want to do
a whole series, Bubby.

27:33.999 --> 27:35.999
- I--
- Hey, Tom, stop.

27:35.999 --> 27:38.999
Tom tends to get pissy when
it comes to things like this.

27:38.999 --> 27:39.999
He gets this idea
in his head

27:39.999 --> 27:41.999
that it's gonna be
painful or cheesy...

27:41.999 --> 27:43.999
Tom.

27:43.999 --> 27:44.999
But no matter what,
we're gonna do it,

27:44.999 --> 27:47.999
and he's gonna have fun,
and he's gonna like it, for me.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.999
- One second!
- Ah!

27:50.999 --> 27:51.999
Ah!

27:51.999 --> 27:53.999
- Dude, that's funny.
- Wait.

27:53.999 --> 27:54.999
- Ah!
- You're in--

27:54.999 --> 27:55.999
- What is this?

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
- I thought he was
a professional model,

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
and sometimes modeling
can be tough, right?

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
I'm not doing it.

28:01.999 --> 28:03.999
It doesn't even make sense.
- Okay, okay, so wait.

28:04.999 --> 28:05.999
- Oh, my God.
That's so good.

28:05.999 --> 28:06.999
- I'm concerned
that this might be

28:06.999 --> 28:08.999
the first of many things

28:09.000 --> 28:12.999
that are cheesy and expensive
leading up to the wedding.

28:12.999 --> 28:14.999
- Oh, stop.

28:14.999 --> 28:15.999
- She's saving him?

28:15.999 --> 28:17.999
- Down, and then
I'll go like this,

28:18.000 --> 28:19.999
and go...

28:19.999 --> 28:20.999
- Oh, my God.
That's gonna be so cute.

28:20.999 --> 28:23.999
That booty, though.

28:23.999 --> 28:25.999
- We're gonna be doing things
no matter what,

28:25.999 --> 28:28.000
and then eventually maybe
he'll start to enjoy them.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.999
If not, that's his fault.

28:30.999 --> 28:31.999
- Remember when we were
lingerie shopping

28:31.999 --> 28:33.999
and you said
that Jax told you

28:33.999 --> 28:35.000
that, like, Tom was pissed
that he couldn't talk

28:35.999 --> 28:36.999
about his band
or something?

28:36.999 --> 28:38.999
- Yeah, he brought that up
again last night.

28:38.999 --> 28:39.999
- That night, like,
Jax was, like,

28:39.999 --> 28:41.999
talking about Brittany
and her boobs.

28:41.999 --> 28:44.000
I mean, we talked
for a good hour about it.

28:44.999 --> 28:45.999
- Okay.

28:45.999 --> 28:47.999
Part of me feels like
he was using

28:47.999 --> 28:48.999
something Brittany's
going through

28:48.999 --> 28:50.999
and exploiting it
to get attention,

28:50.999 --> 28:52.999
and the fact that
the same night,

28:52.999 --> 28:53.999
he literally said that--
- Right, right, right.

28:53.999 --> 28:54.999
- You know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

28:54.999 --> 28:55.999
- This--phew.

28:55.999 --> 28:57.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:57.999 --> 28:58.999
- Hey, guys.

28:58.999 --> 28:59.999
I had to talk to Brittany
and check in on her.

28:59.999 --> 29:00.999
- Yeah?
- Feeling some pain right now.

29:00.999 --> 29:01.999
And I feel awful, but--

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
- Oh, my God.
- She looked--

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
Hi, how are you?
- Oh, hey, thanks.

29:05.999 --> 29:06.999
- Mwah.
Brittany sends her love.

29:06.999 --> 29:08.999
- Aww.
- Looking sexy, man.

29:08.999 --> 29:09.999
Hair blowing in the wind.
- Thanks, bro.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
- Okay, there's 3 million
different conversations

29:11.999 --> 29:13.999
going on.
- Yeah.

29:13.999 --> 29:14.999
- Something happened
at Pump that I'm...

29:14.999 --> 29:17.999
- James showed up,
I guess, to work drunk.

29:17.999 --> 29:20.999
Then him and Richardson,
like, completely got into it.

29:20.999 --> 29:22.999
I just know
that Ken and Lisa

29:22.999 --> 29:24.999
were calling in James
for a meeting today,

29:24.999 --> 29:25.999
and Richardson had
to be there

29:25.999 --> 29:26.999
as, like, a witness.
- Oh.

29:32.999 --> 29:34.999
- So, you know, James...

29:34.999 --> 29:37.999
He's just a little out of
control right now, isn't he?

29:37.999 --> 29:39.999
- Yeah, I think it's just
a maturity thing.

29:39.999 --> 29:41.999
- I know also
what he's gonna do.

29:41.999 --> 29:43.999
He's gonna be begging.

29:43.999 --> 29:46.999
He's gonna be contrite.
He's gonna be remorseful.

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
- I've never seen
this side of him.

29:48.999 --> 29:50.999
- Here he is.
Please sit down.

29:53.999 --> 29:55.999
- How you feeling?

29:55.999 --> 29:56.999
- Like sh**, obviously.

29:56.999 --> 29:57.999
- That does not make me
unhappy,

29:57.999 --> 29:59.999
the fact that you're
embarrassed.

29:59.999 --> 30:00.999
- I kn--I know.

30:00.999 --> 30:03.999
- I've seen your texts,
and I haven't responded,

30:03.999 --> 30:05.999
'cause I wanted to talk
to you in person.

30:05.999 --> 30:07.999
James has been
texting me nonstop

30:07.999 --> 30:09.000
since the blowup
with Richardson.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.999
"Please go easy on me
tomorrow, Lisa.

30:10.999 --> 30:12.999
"I know things
have been messed up,

30:12.999 --> 30:16.999
but I will make it back,
I swear."

30:16.999 --> 30:19.999
We understand that you
turned up loaded.

30:19.999 --> 30:20.999
- Kristen showed up too.

30:20.999 --> 30:21.999
- Why is she here?
You're like a magnet for her.

30:21.999 --> 30:23.999
- No.

30:23.999 --> 30:24.999
Showed up to work drunk.

30:24.999 --> 30:26.999
Kristen walks in
throwing in my face

30:26.999 --> 30:28.999
that she's, like,
seeing this guy.

30:28.999 --> 30:30.999
She knows she's trying
to wind me up,

30:30.999 --> 30:31.999
and it's really
f***ing working.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
It gets to the point
where Kristen and I

30:33.999 --> 30:34.999
obviously start shouting
at each other

30:34.999 --> 30:37.999
in the middle of f***ing Pump
in front of the customers.

30:37.999 --> 30:39.999
Richardson tries to stop
the situation.

30:39.999 --> 30:41.999
I tell him to mind
his own f***ing business.

30:41.999 --> 30:44.999
I get into his face.
It was a complete fiasco.

30:58.999 --> 31:01.999
You said, "You're not talented;
you're nothing.

31:01.999 --> 31:02.999
"You're beneath me.

31:02.999 --> 31:05.999
I'm above you.
I'm James Kennedy."

31:06.999 --> 31:08.999
- That's the person you become
when you're drunk.

31:08.999 --> 31:10.999
- Because I try to hurt people
when I'm drunk.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.999
- And who are you hurting
most of all?

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
- I guess myself.

31:15.999 --> 31:16.999
- It's repetitive.
It's a pattern.

31:16.999 --> 31:18.999
And that's become
his normality,

31:18.999 --> 31:21.999
and I cannot support that
any longer.

31:21.999 --> 31:22.999
It's a job.

31:22.999 --> 31:23.999
- Yeah.

31:23.999 --> 31:26.999
- And I don't think,
right now at Pump,

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
it's a job
you're cut out for.

31:31.999 --> 31:32.999
- Can you, like, put me
under suspension

31:32.999 --> 31:35.999
for two weeks,
and I will bus tables.

31:35.999 --> 31:37.999
I will scrub floors.
I'll be a dishwasher.

31:37.999 --> 31:40.999
I'm not gonna be erratic anymore
without alcohol in my system.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
I seriously had a revelation
that night; I did.

31:42.999 --> 31:43.999
- A revelation that came
at my expense.

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
- Can I finish what I'm saying
or no?

31:45.999 --> 31:47.999
- There you go--
that's f***ing disrespectful.

31:47.999 --> 31:50.999
- Lisa, because I can't talk.
I can't get two minutes in.

31:50.999 --> 31:52.999
- Go away,
and grow the f*** up.

31:52.999 --> 31:55.999
I cannot have you in Pump.

31:55.999 --> 31:58.999
We need to take, right now,
a permanent break.

31:58.999 --> 32:00.999
- Come on.

32:00.999 --> 32:01.999
What's happening
with the Pump album?

32:01.999 --> 32:02.999
Is that gonna be
on the standstill?

32:02.999 --> 32:04.999
- I don't know
about the Pump album.

32:04.999 --> 32:05.999
That is a miniscule--

32:05.999 --> 32:07.999
- That's been my life.
- Well, don't--

32:07.999 --> 32:08.999
- It's a miniscule part
for you

32:08.999 --> 32:11.999
because you got so many things
going on, but that's my--

32:11.999 --> 32:15.999
- James,
you have had nobody

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
more supportive to you
than Ken and me.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.999
Literally.
- So what do you want me to do,

32:19.999 --> 32:20.999
like, during the week now?

32:20.999 --> 32:21.999
I'm gonna have nothing
to do.

32:21.999 --> 32:24.999
- Listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

32:24.999 --> 32:26.999
I understand you're contrite.

32:26.999 --> 32:27.999
I understand you're emotional.

32:27.999 --> 32:29.999
And I'm sorry for your tears,

32:29.999 --> 32:34.999
but maybe this is a lesson
where you grow up now.

32:34.999 --> 32:35.999
You grow up.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
- You know what,
I want you to go back

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
to bussing tables
three days a week.

32:41.999 --> 32:46.999
I want your feet to be
firmly planted on the ground.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.999
- Sorry, Richardson.
I know--I know I f***ed up.

32:49.999 --> 32:50.999
I know I screwed up, man.

32:50.999 --> 32:51.999
Won't happen again.
Cheers for everything.

32:51.999 --> 32:53.999
- Can you get your stuff
together?

32:53.999 --> 32:55.999
- All right.

32:55.999 --> 32:57.999
- ♪ It's
a black, black, black ♪

32:57.999 --> 33:01.999
♪ Black hole
we're sinking in ♪

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
- You've given him
a lot of chances.

33:03.999 --> 33:06.000
- More chances than he deserves,
if I'm honest.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.999
- ♪ You're digging in ♪

33:07.999 --> 33:10.000
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

33:10.999 --> 33:11.999
- She's been talking
a lot of sh** about me.

33:11.999 --> 33:13.999
- Because you're negative
and you're sour.

33:13.999 --> 33:14.999
- Are you writing this down?

33:14.999 --> 33:16.999
- No one here
even likes you!

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
♪ Nobody gonna bring you down ♪

33:26.999 --> 33:29.999
♪ Don't try to tame us,

33:29.999 --> 33:31.999
- Lala, I feel like we're
missing somebody in the trio.

33:31.999 --> 33:33.999
Where's James?
Where's your guys' sidekick?

33:33.999 --> 33:34.999
- Well, I think they're coming.

33:34.999 --> 33:35.999
I know he's talking
about bringing

33:35.999 --> 33:37.999
some girl with him
that he met, so...

33:37.999 --> 33:38.999
- Wait, but isn't--he's
bringing a girl with him,

33:38.999 --> 33:40.999
but he's trying
to get Kristen back,

33:40.999 --> 33:41.999
but Kristen's
coming here with--

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
- James is coming here?
- Wait, I thought he liked Lala.

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
I'm so confused.
- Oh.

33:45.999 --> 33:47.999
- His goal in life
is to make people jealous

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
and also always
have someone around

33:50.999 --> 33:51.999
because he's so insecure

33:51.999 --> 33:52.999
that he can never be
just by himself.

33:52.999 --> 33:54.999
Lala!

33:54.999 --> 33:56.999
- I mean,
I'm no psychology major,

33:57.000 --> 33:58.999
but I know
a little bit about it.

33:58.999 --> 34:01.999
I am so confused
by the men at Sur

34:01.999 --> 34:03.999
because it seems that
they always need

34:04.000 --> 34:05.999
someone who's fully committed
to them

34:05.999 --> 34:08.999
as they're off cheating
every five seconds.

34:08.999 --> 34:10.999
- So Kristen brought
a date last night.

34:10.999 --> 34:12.999
- Yeah,
Carter was there

34:12.999 --> 34:14.999
at The Parlor
for Kristen's comedy show.

34:14.999 --> 34:16.999
- Wait, so Kristen had
a comedy show?

34:16.999 --> 34:17.999
- Yeah, she did
sketch comedy,

34:17.999 --> 34:20.999
and then there were stand-ups
in between sketch.

34:20.999 --> 34:23.999
- I'm loving the no-weave look
on you, lady.

34:25.999 --> 34:26.999
- Wow, has she been taking
sketch classes,

34:26.999 --> 34:27.999
or did she just
kind of, like,

34:27.999 --> 34:30.999
decide she was gonna start
being funny or--

34:30.999 --> 34:32.999
- I thought it was
pretty funny.

34:32.999 --> 34:33.999
- I mean, if you're gonna do
sketch comedy,

34:33.999 --> 34:35.999
shouldn't you, like, take
a class or something, or like--

34:35.999 --> 34:37.999
- I don't know what she does
in her free time, but--

34:37.999 --> 34:38.999
- I take sketch comedy
very seriously.

34:38.999 --> 34:40.999
So it offends me
when people just think

34:40.999 --> 34:43.999
that they can just...
do it.

34:43.999 --> 34:46.999
I'm all about people trying
to better themselves.

34:46.999 --> 34:47.999
Lord knows she needs a hobby,

34:47.999 --> 34:49.999
but you don't just start

34:49.999 --> 34:51.999
telling people
that you do comedy.

34:51.999 --> 34:54.999
I mean, Kristen's a joke,
but she doesn't make jokes.

34:54.999 --> 34:56.999
- I think she's been
hanging out with Rachael

34:56.999 --> 34:58.999
and Rachael's comedy group,
and Rachael is--

34:58.999 --> 35:00.999
- I think that Rachael is funny
in conversation,

35:01.000 --> 35:04.999
but I don't think her jokes
are original or funny, really.

35:04.999 --> 35:07.999
- Ariana sure has
a lot of strong opinions

35:08.000 --> 35:11.999
on a comedy show
that she never even saw.

35:11.999 --> 35:13.999
She's living under
a little rain cloud right now,

35:13.999 --> 35:14.999
and that's kind of f***ed up.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.999
- The show overall was funny.
- Is she trying to be me?

35:16.999 --> 35:17.999
Or what is she doing?
- We did laugh a lot.

35:20.999 --> 35:22.999
- I'm tired of pretending
like I don't notice

35:22.999 --> 35:24.999
that there's, like,
major, like,

35:24.999 --> 35:25.999
attitude
behind this whole thing.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
You're different
about hanging out,

35:27.999 --> 35:28.999
and I don't want to pretend
like I don't notice anymore,

35:29.000 --> 35:30.999
and I've been trying
to, like, be sensitive

35:30.999 --> 35:31.999
to your feelings,
but it's just very, like--

35:31.999 --> 35:34.999
- Okay, and, I mean,
I've been kind of pretending

35:34.999 --> 35:35.999
like I've been having
a good time

35:35.999 --> 35:37.999
around you guys
for a long time, so...

35:42.999 --> 35:44.000
- Well,
I have to go set up

35:44.000 --> 35:45.999
for the other shot
we're gonna do, so...

35:45.999 --> 35:47.999
- Do you need help?
I'm gonna help you.

35:47.999 --> 35:50.999
- Holy, sh**, way to make me
feel like a f***ing idiot

35:50.999 --> 35:54.999
for putting extra effort
into rebuilding our friendship.

35:54.999 --> 35:56.999
If you're not
having fun with us,

35:56.999 --> 35:58.999
stop faking it
and stay home.

35:58.999 --> 36:01.999
- Beach day.
So gorgeous.

36:01.999 --> 36:04.000
What's up, guys?
- Hey.

36:04.999 --> 36:05.999
- This is Laurel,
everyone who hasn't met.

36:05.999 --> 36:07.999
- Hi, Laurel.
- Nice to meet you.

36:09.999 --> 36:10.999
- This is Laurel, Scheana.
Scheana, Laurel.

36:10.999 --> 36:11.999
- Hi, nice to meet you guys.

36:11.999 --> 36:13.999
- Shay, Laurel.
Laurel, Scheana.

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
- James knows
exactly what he's doing.

36:15.999 --> 36:18.999
If he makes me a little jealous,
I'll kiss him,

36:18.999 --> 36:19.999
and if I kiss him,
he'll make Kristen

36:20.000 --> 36:21.999
really jealous
so she'll f*** him.

36:21.999 --> 36:23.999
It ain't gonna happen,
James.

36:23.999 --> 36:26.999
I like to kiss
men with jobs,

36:26.999 --> 36:28.999
but I can guarantee you,
Kristen still f***s him.

36:28.999 --> 36:31.999
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened this morning?

36:32.999 --> 36:33.999
I lost my f***ing job
at Pump.

36:33.999 --> 36:35.999
- You got fired from Pump?

36:35.999 --> 36:36.999
- I got fired from Pump,

36:36.999 --> 36:38.999
and the Pump CD
is on hold, yes.

36:38.999 --> 36:41.999
- You're a f***ing DJ.
You know, it's an easy job.

36:41.999 --> 36:43.999
All you got to do is show up,
hit play, and not get drunk,

36:43.999 --> 36:46.999
but he is hell-bent
on f***ing it up,

36:46.999 --> 36:48.999
and to be honest, it's actually
pretty fun to watch.

36:48.999 --> 36:49.999
- I'm heartbroken, bro.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.999
I disappointed Lisa
for the final time.

36:51.999 --> 36:52.999
She's done.
She's over it.

36:52.999 --> 36:54.999
I'm not trying to blame it
on anybody, okay?

36:54.999 --> 36:56.999
I'm not even gonna blame
Kristen on walking in

36:56.999 --> 36:58.999
as to why I got f***ed up,
'cause even if she didn't,

36:58.999 --> 37:00.999
I probably would have screwed up
next month anyway, okay?

37:00.999 --> 37:01.999
It sucks.

37:01.999 --> 37:03.999
- Hi, guys!

37:03.999 --> 37:06.999
- Hi!
How are the pictures?

37:06.999 --> 37:08.999
- Oh, my gosh.
Courtney will have to show you.

37:08.999 --> 37:10.999
- I know exactly what James
is doing.

37:10.999 --> 37:13.999
James assumed that I was
bringing Carter.

37:13.999 --> 37:14.999
James didn't want
to be left alone,

37:14.999 --> 37:16.999
so he put
a Craigslist ad out

37:16.999 --> 37:18.999
to the local
high school newspaper.

37:18.999 --> 37:19.999
Nice try.

37:19.999 --> 37:21.999
- So I have to tell you
something.

37:21.999 --> 37:23.999
You know, we were talking
about your sketch comedy

37:23.999 --> 37:24.999
before you got here,
and then

37:24.999 --> 37:26.999
when Ariana got involved,
she's like,

37:26.999 --> 37:28.999
"All of a sudden,
she's a sketch artist?"

37:28.999 --> 37:29.999
She's like, "I'm sorry,
I've been trained in sketch.

37:29.999 --> 37:32.999
I take that sh**
really seriously."

37:32.999 --> 37:33.999
I get the feeling
Tom and Ariana live

37:33.999 --> 37:35.000
on their own goddamn planet.

37:35.999 --> 37:36.999
We all see it...
- Good.

37:36.999 --> 37:37.999
- And it's, like,
the negativity.

37:37.999 --> 37:39.999
- Right.

37:39.999 --> 37:42.999
- Anyway, I'm gonna drink.
I got to refill my drink.

37:42.999 --> 37:44.999
I actually do feel
really sorry for her now.

37:44.999 --> 37:45.999
- You should.

37:45.999 --> 37:47.999
- Rachael?
I'm f***ing livid.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.999
Huge mistake.
Huge.

37:49.999 --> 37:51.999
Is Jax f***ing with me,
that she was

37:51.999 --> 37:53.999
talking sh** about you
and comedy in general?

37:53.999 --> 37:55.999
Like, f*** this sh**.

37:55.999 --> 37:56.999
Through therapy,

37:56.999 --> 37:59.999
I've learned to not be
so confrontational...

37:59.999 --> 38:01.999
I just feel like I need
to say something.

38:01.999 --> 38:03.999
But getting in Ariana's face
right now

38:03.999 --> 38:05.999
is gonna be
really f***ing therapeutic.

38:05.999 --> 38:07.999
Hey, guys.

38:07.999 --> 38:08.999
- Hey.

38:08.999 --> 38:09.999
- Why the f*** are you
trashing

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
not only her as a comedian
and our show?

38:11.999 --> 38:12.999
- All of this...

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
- I would love to hear her talk,
actually.

38:14.999 --> 38:15.999
- Is not necessary.
- Hold on, let her talk.

38:15.999 --> 38:16.999
- You trashed my show,

38:16.999 --> 38:17.999
and don't trash my best friend,

38:17.999 --> 38:18.999
who's a f***ing comic.

38:18.999 --> 38:20.999
- I said that I had
heard your jokes,

38:20.999 --> 38:22.999
and I didn't think
they were original.

38:22.999 --> 38:23.999
- Oh, are you
a stand-up comic?

38:23.999 --> 38:26.999
- I've been doing comedy
for ten years.

38:26.999 --> 38:28.999
- She was on, like,
a little YouTube short,

38:28.999 --> 38:30.999
shows up on a sitcom
every five years.

38:30.999 --> 38:33.999
As far as I can see,
Ariana sleeps late

38:33.999 --> 38:34.999
and complains a lot.

38:34.999 --> 38:36.999
That's not exactly
working on your career.

38:36.999 --> 38:41.999
You are not a stand-up comic,
so you have no--

38:41.999 --> 38:44.999
- You are not a sketch actor.

38:44.999 --> 38:45.999
- Actually, I killed
the game last night,

38:45.999 --> 38:47.000
and I wrote
one of the sketches.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Yeah. I did.
- That's great. Good job.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
- She does this four or five
f***ing nights a week.

38:51.999 --> 38:52.999
- You are so amped up
right now.

38:52.999 --> 38:54.000
- 'Cause you're
a f***ing idiot,

38:54.000 --> 38:55.999
and you talk
out of your ass...

38:55.999 --> 38:56.999
- No, I'm not.
- And you're negative.

38:56.999 --> 38:58.999
- She didn't say
what you said that she said.

38:58.999 --> 38:59.999
- Yes, she did.
- No, she didn't.

38:59.999 --> 39:00.999
- Were you there?
- Jax...

39:00.999 --> 39:01.999
- Oh, oh, Jax said that.

39:05.999 --> 39:06.999
- Scheana,
your best friend...

39:06.999 --> 39:07.999
- f*** no, she's not.
- Told us what.

39:07.999 --> 39:09.999
- She has not been acting
like my best friend.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.999
- Yeah.

39:11.999 --> 39:12.999
- She's been talking
a lot of sh** about me.

39:12.999 --> 39:13.999
- Because you're negative
and you're sour.

39:13.999 --> 39:14.999
- Okay.
- If you can just be

39:14.999 --> 39:16.999
positive and be normal
and be chill--

39:16.999 --> 39:18.000
Are you writing this down?

39:18.999 --> 39:20.999
- No one here even likes you!
I'm--

39:20.999 --> 39:22.000
- Hey, Kristen,
what's your survival rate

39:22.999 --> 39:23.999
on friends these days?
'Cause I know a lot of--

39:23.999 --> 39:25.999
- I'm sorry, 'cause
I am literally friends

39:25.999 --> 39:26.999
with every single person
here.

39:26.999 --> 39:29.999
- Yeah, and you've literally
done your f***ing job

39:29.999 --> 39:31.000
ass-kissing everybody and,
like--

39:31.999 --> 39:32.999
- It's not ass-kissing.
- Yes, it is.

39:32.999 --> 39:33.999
- It's called owning my sh**.
- Oh.

39:33.999 --> 39:36.999
- I acted immaturely
last summer...

39:36.999 --> 39:37.999
- Immaturely?
- And I apologized for that.

39:37.999 --> 39:40.000
- Kristen, you were
full-blown f***ing psycho.

39:42.999 --> 39:43.999
- Schwartz, stop it!

39:43.999 --> 39:45.999
What the f*** are you--
- Oh!

39:45.999 --> 39:49.999
- I have your girlfriend
insulting my best friend.

39:49.999 --> 39:50.999
Like, go f*** yourself.

39:50.999 --> 39:51.999
- Okay.

39:51.999 --> 39:53.999
- I'm done with this sh**.

39:53.999 --> 39:55.000
- I didn't insult you,
and I didn't say you're--

39:55.999 --> 39:56.999
- Yes, you did.
You're a f***ing ****.

39:56.999 --> 39:59.999
- Oh, God.
- Oh, I'm a **** again.

39:59.999 --> 40:00.999
Everything comes
full circle.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.999
- It's the real Kristen.

40:02.999 --> 40:03.999
- Yup.

40:11.999 --> 40:13.999
♪ Cool head, a new sound ♪

40:13.999 --> 40:15.999
♪ No, I don't want to lie ♪

40:15.999 --> 40:22.999
♪ You got the sunset
right on time ♪

40:22.999 --> 40:26.999
- I haven't seen a sunset
like this since Hawaii.

40:26.999 --> 40:27.999
- Hawaii was nice.

40:27.999 --> 40:29.999
- It was nice
until the end.

40:31.999 --> 40:32.999
I don't know if I'm gonna
go to jail for three days.

40:32.999 --> 40:34.999
I don't know if I'm gonna
go to jail for a month.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.999
I don't know; it's all
up in the air right now.

40:36.999 --> 40:37.999
Am I scared?
Absolutely.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.999
When you're a 36-year-old man
taking something from a store...

40:40.999 --> 40:41.999
- That's a little bit
different.

40:41.999 --> 40:43.999
- There's something wrong.

40:45.999 --> 40:48.999
Trying to build my credibility
is really hard

40:48.999 --> 40:49.999
because I keep f***ing up,

40:49.999 --> 40:53.999
and I don't know the direction
I'm supposed to go.

40:53.999 --> 40:55.999
Am I happy with who I am?

40:55.999 --> 40:57.999
Am I happy with where I am?
I--

40:57.999 --> 40:59.999
- Well, are you happy
with who you are?

40:59.999 --> 41:00.999
- I don't know,
and I got to figure it out.

41:00.999 --> 41:02.999
You know, Brittany
moving in,

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
and, you know, I'm doing
the token Jax move

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
where she moves in;
within five days,

41:06.999 --> 41:08.999
I feel like I need
to escape.

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
You know, at my age,

41:09.999 --> 41:11.000
I shouldn't be
getting arrested.

41:11.999 --> 41:12.999
I shouldn't be
getting in trouble,

41:12.999 --> 41:16.999
and I just feel like, you know,
just out of control.

41:16.999 --> 41:17.999
You got Stassi
back in the picture.

41:17.999 --> 41:19.999
We got Kristen
back in the picture.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.999
I'm arguing with Tom
and Ariana

41:21.999 --> 41:24.999
about stuff that maybe
I was in the wrong.

41:24.999 --> 41:26.999
Maybe I wasn't.
I don't know.

41:26.999 --> 41:28.999
There's so much.
It's not just one thing.

41:28.999 --> 41:29.999
It's not just the group.

41:29.999 --> 41:31.999
Even though I try not
to let things bother me,

41:31.999 --> 41:33.000
it's--it's just--
it's tiring.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.999
I think there's just, like,
something wrong upstairs,

41:35.999 --> 41:37.999
but at 36, I mean,
can I change?

41:37.999 --> 41:39.999
I don't know.
I would love to change.

41:39.999 --> 41:42.000
I would love to be
not so involved in everything,

41:42.999 --> 41:43.999
but I feel like
that's just me.

41:43.999 --> 41:45.000
That's--I'm always
involved.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.999
I'm, like, in there
some way or another.

41:46.999 --> 41:48.000
Even if it doesn't
concern me,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.999
I feel like I have to be
the center of attention.

41:50.999 --> 41:54.999
I feel like I'm not accepted
if I'm not talked about.

41:54.999 --> 41:57.999
- It's not that--it's not bad
not to be talked about.

42:00.999 --> 42:03.999
- I don't have a ton of people
in this town to talk to

42:03.999 --> 42:05.999
besides you and Tom and Tom,
and right now,

42:05.999 --> 42:10.999
I don't know how much I can
even speak to Tom, so...

42:10.999 --> 42:11.999
And it's sad
because, you know,

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
for me to lose my friends
would be huge to me.

42:13.999 --> 42:14.999
- I know.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
- Huge.

42:16.999 --> 42:20.999
I don't have anything else,
so for me to f*** up--

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
Stassi should be back here.
Everyone should be back here.

42:26.999 --> 42:28.000
I'm the one that
should be gone.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
These are my good friends,
and they're--I feel like

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
they're constantly,
like, making excuses

42:35.999 --> 42:38.999
and bailing me out
of f***ing trouble.

42:38.999 --> 42:39.999
It's just embarrassing.

42:42.999 --> 42:44.999
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:44.999 --> 42:47.999
- He was rage-texting me
for four hours.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.999
The bubble never stopped
for one second.

42:49.999 --> 42:50.999
- Why don't you f***ing stick up
for your friend

42:50.999 --> 42:52.999
and not just throw me
under the bus?

42:52.999 --> 42:55.999
- I'm not throwing you
under the bus personally.

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
- If Ariana can just peace-out
on me so easy,

42:57.999 --> 42:59.999
like, maybe everyone else
can too.

42:59.999 --> 43:01.999
- I'm basically fired
from Pump.

43:01.999 --> 43:02.999
- What?

43:02.999 --> 43:04.999
- Kristen walked in, and then
everything just goes up.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.999
- She was there, and you
got fired--end of story.

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
- Surprise, bitches.

43:11.999 --> 43:12.999
- Oh, my God.

43:12.999 --> 43:14.999
