WEBVTT

00:00.685 --> 00:02.843
These lovely young people
on either side of me

00:02.971 --> 00:04.159
are the best in the business.

00:04.302 --> 00:05.766
If there is a hole in your security,

00:05.907 --> 00:08.029
we will find it before the bad guys do.

00:08.145 --> 00:10.859
Now a legend of your
extraordinary stature needs

00:10.993 --> 00:14.332
the extraordinary security
that only Contra can provide.

00:14.463 --> 00:18.738
So what do you say, champ?
Fine. You're hired.

00:23.122 --> 00:25.157
"On Mike" Tyson!

00:25.295 --> 00:28.142
Man, I have seen every
fight you've ever been in.

00:28.404 --> 00:29.657
Would you do me the honor of punching me

00:29.810 --> 00:32.981
square in the face?
Seems like you need your brain cells.

00:33.107 --> 00:35.532
Verbal right hook to the cranium.

00:35.781 --> 00:38.379
Awesome!

00:38.612 --> 00:40.620
Okay, my little prize fighters,

00:40.746 --> 00:43.674
let's go over this one more time.
What's our top priority?

00:43.819 --> 00:46.928
- Mike Tyson. - And what will happen
to you if Iron Mike's estate

00:47.071 --> 00:50.208
isn't 100% secure?
You'll lock us in a dank basement

00:50.349 --> 00:52.322
and sew us together like a human centipede.

00:52.472 --> 00:55.469
Exactly. So hop to it.
Except you, Butterscotch.

00:55.615 --> 00:58.848
You're working on a separate
case, away from Melanie.

00:59.046 --> 00:59.987
What? Why?

01:00.119 --> 01:02.576
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because your little office crush

01:02.700 --> 01:05.230
is crushing this office. Need I remind you...
What? I...

01:05.363 --> 01:06.562
What happened last week?

01:08.234 --> 01:10.963
No, like, I love you.

01:11.102 --> 01:13.873
I'm sorry, but I do. I love you, Melanie.

01:14.014 --> 01:17.288
I already made it my ringtone.
Check it out.

01:18.429 --> 01:19.628
Right?

01:20.843 --> 01:23.484
Okay, no one can let Dutch hear this.

01:23.633 --> 01:25.620
He gets... really jealous.

01:25.839 --> 01:28.016
Okay, now I'm gonna do your breast exam.

01:28.818 --> 01:32.015
Keep your damn hands off my girl.
Hey, baby.

01:32.151 --> 01:34.499
Oz, I swear, everything's
cool with me and Melanie.

01:34.630 --> 01:36.440
Just let me do the Tyson
job, and I promise,

01:36.570 --> 01:39.447
it won't be awkward.
Hyah!

01:39.582 --> 01:40.892
Sorry I'm late.

01:41.035 --> 01:45.058
Just chucking some nun.
Gotta get pumped up for Michael Tyson.

01:45.443 --> 01:47.272
Two things we got in common...

01:47.648 --> 01:52.108
We both hate wearing shirts
and we both have tattoos,

01:52.243 --> 01:55.998
only his... is on his face!

01:59.305 --> 02:01.659
You interested in hearing about
the other job yet, Cambo?

02:01.781 --> 02:03.507
Yes, I am.

02:08.687 --> 02:11.449
All right, so your job is a cinch.
You gotta take care

02:11.582 --> 02:13.827
of a 16-year-old kid
named Leslie Kaczander.

02:13.949 --> 02:16.796
Sweet. So what is he? Internet billionaire?
Boy band pop star?

02:16.868 --> 02:18.882
Teen mayor? What?
Random dweebus.

02:19.012 --> 02:21.524
His parents hired us to find out
who's been cyberbullying him

02:21.671 --> 02:22.847
on the Internet.
Seriously?

02:22.986 --> 02:24.757
I don't want to babysit
some high school geek.

02:24.903 --> 02:26.842
Aw, Campon, you're acting all skittish

02:26.970 --> 02:28.143
because you were a high school geek.

02:28.588 --> 02:29.374
All right, remember,

02:29.526 --> 02:31.771
if anyone asks, you like guys,
and you're not my cousin.

02:32.665 --> 02:35.157
Okay, okay, okay, fine.
High school wasn't all roses.

02:35.306 --> 02:36.789
Maybe I was a Leslie.
No, no.

02:36.939 --> 02:39.093
I believe your cousin was the "Leslie."

02:39.304 --> 02:40.728
Uh, come on, Oz, I bet even you had it

02:40.884 --> 02:44.116
a little rough in high school.
Ha! No. I ruled the place.

02:44.248 --> 02:47.183
One day, me and my buddy--
we ditched class,

02:47.321 --> 02:50.080
stole his dad's Ferrari, I
got to sing in a parade,

02:50.212 --> 02:52.603
pretended to be the sausage king of Chicago.
It was great!

02:52.729 --> 02:55.010
I think my buddy John made a
movie about it or something.

02:55.147 --> 02:56.309
You mean "Ferris Bueller"?

02:56.453 --> 02:57.619
Never heard of him.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.372
Hey... there.

02:59.519 --> 03:00.982
I am looking for Cameron Price.

03:01.124 --> 03:03.206
And also, if you have any extra tissues,

03:03.344 --> 03:07.174
I have a raging nosebleed.
And, uh, oh, it stopped.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.824
Um, I'm Leslie.

03:08.979 --> 03:11.191
Uh, right this way.

03:11.511 --> 03:13.787
Hey, you go to memorial?
That's where I went.

03:13.928 --> 03:16.120
Go, Wildcats! Clawup.

03:17.985 --> 03:20.699
Listen, somebody at my school is
making my life a living hell.

03:20.832 --> 03:24.106
Okay? I can't take it anymore.
Just look.

03:25.527 --> 03:27.007
You crapped your pants?

03:27.141 --> 03:28.462
No, I didn't crap my pants.

03:28.603 --> 03:32.922
I mean, I have, but I didn't--
I would never admit it to--Aah!

03:33.057 --> 03:34.518
It's a fake page. It's fake.

03:34.650 --> 03:38.078
Okay, this person is posing
as me and sending messages

03:38.226 --> 03:40.155
to this girl I've been in
love with since fifth grade.

03:40.279 --> 03:41.536
Look.

03:41.872 --> 03:44.408
Everybody knows
that I love Megan Diamond now,

03:44.538 --> 03:48.235
and I'm a laughingstock.
Do you have any idea how I feel?

03:48.358 --> 03:49.789
Yeah. Yeah, I kinda do.

03:49.931 --> 03:53.737
Come on. Let's track down
this cyber dick. That?

03:53.874 --> 03:56.872
Hell, yeah. A Nigerian scammer
stole 10 grand from my grandma,

03:57.009 --> 03:58.114
but I took care of him.

04:03.016 --> 04:04.535
I deserve this.

04:06.805 --> 04:08.651
Busted. And there's your cyberbully.

04:08.789 --> 04:10.918
Does Kip O'Bannon ring a bell?
Oh, no.

04:11.041 --> 04:13.526
- What? - Uh, okay, that's Megan
Diamond's ex-boyfriend.

04:13.662 --> 04:16.685
Well, just turn him in.
Look, dude, he's crazy, okay?

04:16.819 --> 04:18.909
He once cut a kid's hair off and ate it,

04:19.067 --> 04:21.560
just to prove a point.
I gotta get outta here.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.344
I'll just tell my parents
you couldn't find him.

04:23.473 --> 04:25.224
No, no. I don't feel comfortable with that.

04:25.350 --> 04:26.863
Well, I do. I gotta go.

04:26.991 --> 04:28.549
Hey, guys, a little detour.

04:28.683 --> 04:31.167
I need some help with my assignment.
You got it. What's up?

04:31.310 --> 04:33.405
We're going back to high school.

04:36.473 --> 04:37.914
Yeah!

04:40.864 --> 04:43.651
This is Leslie Kaczander,
victim of cyberbullying.

04:43.781 --> 04:47.240
3.7 G.P.A., yearbook editor,
model U.N. Treasurer,

04:47.367 --> 04:49.191
and plays xylophone in the school band.

04:49.318 --> 04:52.433
Xylophone?
Even the letter "z" is embarrassed

04:52.558 --> 04:53.961
to be near that nerd-strument.

04:54.088 --> 04:56.439
Not helping, Dutch.
This is Kip O'Bannon,

04:56.571 --> 04:59.713
our cyberbully and senior,
for the second time.

04:59.852 --> 05:02.193
Hey, I'll help an underdog.
It may be a surprise to you,

05:02.337 --> 05:04.423
but I was picked on in high
school, and y'all know why--

05:04.550 --> 05:06.039
'Cause I'm black.
Sweetie,

05:06.151 --> 05:08.151
I really don't think that was the reason.

05:08.693 --> 05:12.822
Bye, mom! First day of school.
Ninth grade, a fresh start.

05:12.965 --> 05:14.591
High school's gonna be awesome.

05:14.918 --> 05:18.087
Damn it, I'm such a nerd.
Why couldn't it have been racism?

05:18.213 --> 05:20.949
Cash is right.
High school is just a 4-year nightmare

05:21.094 --> 05:24.100
where all the "normal" kids try
to crush your individuality.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.758
Normals. They don't understand us.

05:27.898 --> 05:29.648
Enjoy your gilded cages.

05:29.788 --> 05:30.569
Josh Armstrong,

05:30.727 --> 05:33.500
please report to the music room.
You left your tuba.

05:33.663 --> 05:35.964
Tube of... mascara.

05:36.632 --> 05:37.818
I gotta go.

05:38.084 --> 05:41.738
You were a goth kid?
Don't label me, but yeah.

05:41.877 --> 05:44.150
Guys, I'm excited to finally
get a taste of high school,

05:44.297 --> 05:45.856
all right?
My dad was a grifter.

05:46.003 --> 05:48.141
I never went.
I wish I had never went.

05:48.263 --> 05:50.841
All those purple nirples.
I'm still missing half a nip.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.587
You guys are crazy. High school was epic!

05:53.722 --> 05:55.747
You should've seen some
of the pranks I pulled--

05:55.878 --> 05:58.193
lemon swirly, subatomic wedgie,

05:58.334 --> 06:01.240
my personal fave-- the blazing saddle.

06:01.371 --> 06:03.990
All you need is a lighter and
a butt cheek for that one.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.561
Good times. Oh, my God.
Babe, did you really do those things?

06:07.699 --> 06:09.265
Yeah, sounds like you were the bully.

06:09.398 --> 06:12.391
No, no, no. Those mathletes were my boys.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.876
I'd make 'em laugh so hard, they'd cry.

06:15.006 --> 06:17.169
Deep, heaving sobs of laughter,

06:17.298 --> 06:20.023
just begging me to stop
being so damn funny.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.538
I'm gonna go crank call
those mathletes now.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.950
Okay, Cam, I got eyes on you from the van.

06:25.076 --> 06:27.845
Let's take down our bully.
I've got vis con on O'Bannon.

06:27.978 --> 06:30.659
All right, fire up the spy cam.
I'll tell you when we got him.

06:34.451 --> 06:37.053
Whoo! O'Bannon rules!

06:39.311 --> 06:42.225
That's the one.
Rendezvous in five.

06:42.364 --> 06:43.706
Cameron?

06:43.865 --> 06:45.571
Cameron Price?

06:45.922 --> 06:48.479
It's me, Patty Boggs, from high school.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.466
Patty Boggs?
No, no, no.

06:50.647 --> 06:52.303
Um, no, she was...

06:52.438 --> 06:55.190
Fatty Hoggs.
Yeah, still me.

06:55.321 --> 06:58.050
Patty! Yes! You look great!

06:58.547 --> 07:02.296
Yeah. Wow.
Did you do something with your hair?

07:02.427 --> 07:03.967
Well, I lost 150 pounds.

07:04.104 --> 07:07.211
But your hair is... longer.

07:07.355 --> 07:10.648
Oh.
And, uh, you've lost the accordion.

07:10.788 --> 07:12.153
Yeah. No, I still dabble, though.

07:12.289 --> 07:16.155
But, uh, you lost your acne
and your catchphrases. Uh...

07:17.247 --> 07:19.837
Wassup?!

07:20.037 --> 07:22.978
...Ssup?!
Never gets old.

07:23.105 --> 07:25.850
Little bit old.
Uh, what are you doing here?

07:25.988 --> 07:28.264
I teach A.P. Chemistry.
Oh, okay.

07:28.382 --> 07:31.222
What are you doing here?
Um, I work for Contra Security.

07:31.345 --> 07:33.598
Yeah, principal Grieco hired us to install

07:33.726 --> 07:35.627
some web filtering software...

07:35.749 --> 07:37.785
Blabbity blah computer stuff.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.909
Yeah, it's just an excuse
for me to come back here

07:40.999 --> 07:42.476
and relive my glory days.

07:42.604 --> 07:46.226
Go, Wildcats. Claws up!
Bad times.

07:46.353 --> 07:49.018
The worst. You know, um, actually,

07:49.148 --> 07:50.693
you were the one person back
then who didn't tease me,

07:50.818 --> 07:53.310
and I always thought how nice
it would be to see you again

07:53.435 --> 07:55.856
and to tell you thank you so much

07:55.988 --> 07:57.805
for being a sweetie to me.

07:57.930 --> 08:00.861
Yeah.
No, you're-- you're very welcome.

08:01.469 --> 08:02.967
It was good to see you.

08:03.176 --> 08:04.569
You, too.

08:04.695 --> 08:07.548
Next time, you're gonna
need a hall pass, mister.

08:07.771 --> 08:09.105
Stupid.

08:09.224 --> 08:11.689
No, it's--it was--
Bye.

08:14.793 --> 08:15.757
You got anything yet?

08:15.884 --> 08:18.277
A work of art. Check it out.

08:18.399 --> 08:20.705
You just made the wrong enemy, O'Bannon.

08:20.837 --> 08:22.790
Welcome to Contra Security.

08:26.513 --> 08:27.839
That's not me!

08:29.212 --> 08:31.487
I mean, it's me, but I don't heart Bieber!

08:31.604 --> 08:33.082
I don't heart anyone!

08:35.832 --> 08:37.619
Now that's how you revenge a nerd.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.424
Oh. Man, I wish I had me in high school.

08:39.541 --> 08:43.106
Boys, time to step into detention.

08:43.212 --> 08:44.397
What's he doing with that tushie paddle?

08:44.541 --> 08:46.539
Helping Leslie was supposed to be done

08:46.685 --> 08:49.442
quick and solo, like your date nights.
What happened?

08:49.590 --> 08:51.453
I needed a little help with our cyberbully,

08:51.575 --> 08:52.906
but we crushed it.
Crushed it.

08:53.025 --> 08:55.747
No, pumpkin, you poked the
nest, stirred the hive,

08:55.868 --> 08:58.439
angered the bees, and poor
little Leslie got stung.

08:58.569 --> 09:00.384
O'Bannon found out about what you did.

09:00.531 --> 09:03.947
Now he's gone from
cyberbully to bully bully.

09:04.109 --> 09:05.561
Hey, guys.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.007
Thanks for ruining my life.

09:13.215 --> 09:15.887
The shorts don't lie.
He looks like a slut.

09:16.695 --> 09:19.038
I can't believe O'Bannon
found out we biebered him.

09:19.197 --> 09:23.357
- Well, he did, and then he threw
me into the girls' shower... - Oh.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.139
Butt-naked.

09:24.279 --> 09:27.805
Ah, the old strip and soak.
Good stuff.

09:27.922 --> 09:31.763
Babe, come on. Seriously?
What? No, it's funny. Ask this dude.

09:31.894 --> 09:34.069
Yeah, look at him.
He's dying with laughter.

09:34.194 --> 09:37.656
Wait a second. You're not happy at all.

09:37.787 --> 09:40.123
My God, maybe I was a bully in high school.

09:40.459 --> 09:42.439
Larry here's made me realize
that just 'cause something's

09:42.581 --> 09:43.827
hilarious doesn't mean it's right.

09:43.968 --> 09:46.182
Um, my name's actually Leslie.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.370
Leslie?

09:50.975 --> 09:53.452
What kind of fruity name is...

09:53.586 --> 09:54.854
No.

09:55.119 --> 09:57.067
New leaf, Dutch.

09:57.261 --> 10:00.316
- Hey. We're gonna help you
fight this bully, pal. - Okay.

10:00.444 --> 10:02.786
Ooh. Okay.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.191
Okay, I just got off the
phone with Leslie's parents,

10:05.323 --> 10:08.186
offered my services free
of charge and a snuggie,

10:08.372 --> 10:10.546
'cause you meddling monkeys
decided to throw your poop

10:10.670 --> 10:13.257
all over this poor kid's life.
Hey, you know what? Don't bother.

10:13.411 --> 10:15.851
My life's already a big bowl of suck, so...
Chin up, chachi.

10:15.978 --> 10:18.151
By the time I'm done with you,
you're gonna rule that school.

10:18.294 --> 10:20.625
I'm taking you from sad boy to bad boy.

10:20.746 --> 10:23.517
Oh, yes! Movie makeover.
Dude, that's my favorite.

10:23.650 --> 10:25.441
Meet my master of disguise Josh.

10:25.585 --> 10:28.920
We have hipster chic, skater
punk, new school prep...

10:29.049 --> 10:30.511
Step one--style.

10:30.655 --> 10:32.482
Leslie 2.0.

10:35.130 --> 10:37.170
Step two--wheels.

10:37.567 --> 10:40.122
What happened to my mom's station wagon?
Oh, it's in there.

10:40.267 --> 10:43.756
Just swapped in a new frame,
engine, tires, and stereo.

10:43.882 --> 10:45.258
You just got dutched, son.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.005
Oh, my God! Yes!

10:48.135 --> 10:50.031
Step three--intimidation.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.423
You must possess a menacing glare.
Show us.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.251
That's not menacing. You look constipated.

10:57.461 --> 10:59.529
Step four--self-defense.

10:59.653 --> 11:02.859
I hate you! I hate you!

11:02.994 --> 11:04.268
I couldn't beat you in Nintendo,

11:04.395 --> 11:06.779
but I can beat you now, Mike.
Hey, don't get cocky, kid.

11:06.901 --> 11:07.991
Okay, I'm sorry.

11:08.122 --> 11:10.819
Step five--badass-edness.

11:18.187 --> 11:21.286
Step six--assemble your team.

11:31.359 --> 11:33.551
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Everybody's looking at me.

11:33.677 --> 11:35.316
What do I do?
Act like you've been there, buddy.

11:35.437 --> 11:38.027
Seniors rule!

11:38.160 --> 11:40.588
Dutch, you are supposed to be in the van!

11:40.715 --> 11:42.420
Hey, I might be a year or
ten older than you guys,

11:42.557 --> 11:44.051
but I could totally pull off 17.

11:44.201 --> 11:47.178
Hey, sweet kicks, amigo!
Eat my butt, narc!

11:47.317 --> 11:50.284
Damn it. I just bought this trapper keeper!

11:51.835 --> 11:53.725
This is cool. This is what we used to do.

11:53.861 --> 11:55.033
A little thing called crazy legs.

11:55.155 --> 11:57.482
You know what I'm talking about?
Bam! Ooh!

11:57.626 --> 12:00.182
I am... awesome!

12:00.322 --> 12:02.154
Eat that, grandpa.
Help?

12:02.285 --> 12:03.848
Help me up.
You know, I think I hurt my back.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.882
All right, kiddies, next step--
We're gonna pimp this kid's rep.

12:07.008 --> 12:08.245
Hit your cliques and spread the word--

12:08.380 --> 12:10.827
Leslie Kaczander is a badass.

12:10.958 --> 12:13.499
Leslie Kaczander trains with Mike Tyson?

12:14.852 --> 12:17.365
How is that possible?
Didn't you hear?

12:17.495 --> 12:20.569
Him and Mike Tyson are  B.F.F. besties.
Dork.

12:20.702 --> 12:23.501
Guys. Well, I'd rather be a
dork than have split ends,

12:23.633 --> 12:26.853
snaggletooth, unibrow,
and a janky spray tan.

12:26.977 --> 12:29.081
You are a bitch.

12:29.217 --> 12:31.263
Love it. You wanna hang?

12:31.397 --> 12:33.654
Wow. High school's easy.

12:33.780 --> 12:36.703
Our most important step
of oz-ification is last--

12:36.839 --> 12:37.866
Intrigue.

12:38.803 --> 12:40.214
Oh! Why would you do that?

12:40.366 --> 12:42.830
You were supposed to go to prom with me!

12:42.974 --> 12:45.744
I love you so much it hurts!

12:45.890 --> 12:48.335
What is happening?
"Baby...

12:48.455 --> 12:50.567
We just grew apart." Say it.

12:50.696 --> 12:51.280
Go, Leslie.

12:51.408 --> 12:54.807
Uh, baby, we just grew apart?

12:54.965 --> 12:57.417
I gave you my special gift.

12:57.553 --> 12:59.509
What special gift?
Focus, Leslie.

12:59.650 --> 13:03.046
She's talking about making sexy.
Oh!

13:03.190 --> 13:04.089
Right.

13:04.234 --> 13:07.078
Apologize like a gentleman.
Sorry.

13:07.209 --> 13:11.125
Okay, let's bag our moose.
Do exactly what I do.

13:11.260 --> 13:12.757
Say everything that I say.

13:12.899 --> 13:13.871
Chick's on your six.

13:14.003 --> 13:17.361
I don't know what you just said.
Oh, hello.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.436
Hi.

13:18.583 --> 13:21.014
Um, I don't know if we've
ever actually talked before.

13:21.184 --> 13:23.991
I'm Megan.
I'm... L-Dawg.

13:24.126 --> 13:28.152
Don't improvise, Leslie.
I'm just kidding.

13:28.317 --> 13:29.632
I'm Leslie.

13:29.783 --> 13:32.833
Leslie.
Oz, it's working. It's actually working.

13:32.987 --> 13:35.520
Cameron? Is that you?

13:36.150 --> 13:39.431
Patty! Hi... again. How you doing?

13:39.564 --> 13:41.550
Well, um, well, I was good

13:41.701 --> 13:42.986
until the guy I had a
crush on in high school

13:43.137 --> 13:44.063
started roaming around the hallways

13:44.203 --> 13:48.677
in guyliner and skinny jeans.
Okay, the truth is,

13:48.820 --> 13:50.463
our company was hired by Leslie's parents

13:50.606 --> 13:52.931
to find his cyberbully and--
Wh--You had a crush on me?

13:53.078 --> 13:55.392
What, you didn't notice my
awesome flirting techniques

13:55.526 --> 13:57.236
of never speaking to you and
always looking the other way

13:57.381 --> 13:59.155
when you walked in the room?
For what it's worth,

13:59.285 --> 14:01.215
I didn't notice much back then.

14:02.190 --> 14:04.450
21 minutes and you're mine.

14:05.270 --> 14:07.085
Mom! Hang up the phone!

14:07.230 --> 14:10.180
I'm downloading... homework!

14:12.707 --> 14:14.842
Man, I wish I knew you liked me.

14:15.234 --> 14:17.360
High school would have sucked a lot less.

14:17.483 --> 14:19.898
Well--well, you're making
it better for Leslie, so...

14:20.042 --> 14:22.139
Yeah. Actually, the
little dude's on his way

14:22.292 --> 14:23.462
to finding himself a prom date.

14:23.615 --> 14:25.492
Well, if you want to see
how it all turns out,

14:25.659 --> 14:27.490
you could--you could join me.

14:27.623 --> 14:30.760
I'm... chaperoning.

14:30.894 --> 14:33.676
Patty Boggs, are you asking me to the prom?

14:33.812 --> 14:36.534
See you there?
It's a date.

14:36.666 --> 14:37.804
Great.

14:38.757 --> 14:40.136
Yeah.

14:41.658 --> 14:43.080
I used to be fat.

14:43.223 --> 14:45.192
What?
Yeah.

14:45.331 --> 14:47.467
Okay, bye.
Bye.

14:48.552 --> 14:50.588
Dude, you're never gonna
believe what happened.

14:50.732 --> 14:52.775
Megan Diamond said yes!
I have a date to prom!

14:52.934 --> 14:55.612
Me, too!
Hey, act like you been there.

14:56.927 --> 14:58.834
Looking fine, my man!

14:58.961 --> 15:00.433
I bet it feels nice to go to the prom

15:00.590 --> 15:02.745
without your lady-loving cousin.
It really does.

15:02.876 --> 15:04.489
I gotta say, things are looking up.

15:06.141 --> 15:07.828
What the hell, man?

15:08.117 --> 15:09.953
Anything you wanna tell me?

15:11.288 --> 15:13.331
Anything about you, Mel,

15:13.471 --> 15:15.437
and a little baby girl named Toby?

15:15.558 --> 15:17.146
It's the talk of the office!

15:17.431 --> 15:19.245
I heard Cameron's in love with Melanie.

15:19.650 --> 15:21.056
I heard that they have a love child.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.579
His name is Toby.

15:23.586 --> 15:26.749
Toby's a boy's name.
I mean, there is no Toby.

15:26.886 --> 15:28.357
God, it's like high school around here.

15:28.496 --> 15:29.455
It's just a stupid rumor.

15:29.587 --> 15:32.540
I saw the video.
You called me a douche.

15:32.677 --> 15:37.281
He's such a douche.
Cash, what about me is douche-y?

15:41.754 --> 15:42.574
You know what?

15:42.702 --> 15:45.200
The old Dutch would've pounded
your ass like a shot of Jager,

15:45.319 --> 15:48.906
but the new Dutch is using his
words instead of his fists.

15:49.122 --> 15:51.934
Mel, do you know about the
stuff he said to you?

15:52.180 --> 15:53.815
Yeah, I was there.
Bigger fish.

15:53.927 --> 15:55.983
I just heard from Britney
who got a text from Tiffany

15:56.130 --> 15:57.974
that O'Bannon's gonna destroy Leslie

15:58.105 --> 16:01.761
for taking Megan to the prom.
Damn it. What are we gonna do?

16:01.887 --> 16:05.713
That seems simple to me.
We're going back to prom.

16:05.833 --> 16:06.990
Are you already dressed for prom?

16:07.113 --> 16:08.549
No, I was on my way to Monte Carlo,

16:08.702 --> 16:11.099
but I'm sure this will be just as much fun.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.140
All right, ladies, gather 'round.
Here's the sitch--

16:16.282 --> 16:19.214
Cameron hacked O'Bannon's phone.
Turns out bully boy rigged it

16:19.366 --> 16:20.775
so Leslie will be voted Prom King.

16:20.912 --> 16:23.272
But when he's up onstage getting
crowned, instead of confetti

16:23.423 --> 16:25.636
raining down on him, it's
going to be a bucket of whiz.

16:25.765 --> 16:28.378
Oh, we used to call that
the Prom King Pee Drop!

16:28.495 --> 16:31.754
Also works at Homecoming.
This is serious, guys.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.328
So here's the game plan--
Mel and Dutch,

16:34.472 --> 16:36.175
you're gonna stuff the
ballot box with votes

16:36.313 --> 16:37.901
for our beloved O'Bannon.

16:41.770 --> 16:44.183
Next, Josh will neutralize the deejay.

16:44.308 --> 16:45.302
Ah, monsieur,

16:45.436 --> 16:47.403
would you care for a prom shrimp?

16:50.017 --> 16:51.938
How much horse tranq did you put in there?

16:52.066 --> 16:54.022
I didn't know he was gonna
eat the biggest shrimp.

16:54.203 --> 16:55.732
Let's crown our Prom King.

16:55.902 --> 16:58.867
Ladies and gentlemen, may
I have your attention?

16:59.024 --> 17:01.975
This year's prom king is...

17:02.868 --> 17:05.126
Kip O'Bannon!

17:09.959 --> 17:12.156
This is a mistake.
You can't make me Prom King!

17:12.281 --> 17:14.528
That cannon's loaded with
three weeks of my pee!

17:19.665 --> 17:21.944
Kip doesn't know that
we swapped out his pee

17:22.073 --> 17:23.595
for a little something else.

17:30.013 --> 17:33.489
He also doesn't know that his
mom is missing her cell phone.

17:34.173 --> 17:35.717
Thanks for bringing my lunch, mom.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.291
Now get out of here. People are watching.

17:38.978 --> 17:41.422
Ooh. Excuse me, ma'am.

17:41.815 --> 17:43.317
Sucka!

17:44.447 --> 17:47.774
And now for the Prom Queen...

17:48.695 --> 17:50.485
Mom, it's Kip.

17:50.623 --> 17:53.412
I-I had an accident, and I need
you to come home right now.

17:53.566 --> 17:56.496
My thumb got caught in
the jacuzzi jet and...

17:56.789 --> 17:59.231
Okay, it's not my thumb. It's my wiener.

17:59.373 --> 18:01.751
Hurry, mommy. It's my wiener!

18:08.676 --> 18:11.375
Now that's how you revenge a nerd.

18:11.498 --> 18:12.725
Hey, Cam.

18:13.465 --> 18:16.106
As part of my nerd forgiveness program,

18:16.507 --> 18:18.937
I'm ready to forget about what you said.

18:19.570 --> 18:21.679
No, I really shouldn't
have said those things.

18:21.808 --> 18:23.344
I'm sorry, Dutch.

18:23.485 --> 18:27.155
So you--you don't think I'm
a total douche nozzle?

18:27.280 --> 18:28.522
No.

18:29.410 --> 18:30.932
Partial.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.031
Thanks, man.

18:34.198 --> 18:36.550
You feel my junk?
Yes.

18:37.968 --> 18:39.335
Awesome.

18:42.039 --> 18:43.267
Hey.

18:43.708 --> 18:46.293
There's an after-party at Teegan's. You in?

18:46.490 --> 18:48.077
You know, if you had gone to high school,

18:48.217 --> 18:49.747
you would've ruled the place.
You know,

18:49.871 --> 18:52.065
I'm just--I'm glad I finally got a taste.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.320
I'm glad I'm not here
with my lesbian cousin

18:54.721 --> 18:58.749
who made out with my gym teacher.
So, uh...

18:58.972 --> 19:02.715
I should really get over to my date.
Yes. A-absolutely. Go.

19:02.864 --> 19:05.500
It's--it's your prom.

19:06.694 --> 19:08.873
Sweet back brace, brother!

19:09.087 --> 19:11.638
'Sup, Ginger.
Making it work!

19:11.775 --> 19:13.878
Hey, pirate teeth, I wanna get to know you!

19:14.012 --> 19:15.090
So...

19:15.222 --> 19:19.728
What exactly are your chaperone duties?

19:19.856 --> 19:21.794
Oh, you know, just the usual.
I-I just have to make sure

19:21.922 --> 19:24.695
the kids don't do anything off-limits.

19:24.822 --> 19:27.116
Would this be off-limits?

19:41.263 --> 19:43.267
I have to do the rounds.

19:43.394 --> 19:46.071
Don't go far, okay?
I won't.

20:07.638 --> 20:10.884
Ah, prom. Magical night.

20:11.006 --> 20:13.614
Uh, you really shouldn't eat those shrimp.

20:13.738 --> 20:16.882
Don't worry about it.
I'm immune to all poisons and sedatives.

20:17.002 --> 20:20.357
Guys, I cannot thank you enough.

20:20.495 --> 20:23.697
I mean, tonight has been
the best night of my life.

20:23.829 --> 20:26.059
Well, great. I mean, if you
need anything else, we--

20:26.217 --> 20:28.443
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I think I've got it from here.

20:28.570 --> 20:31.046
I mean, at some point I gotta
fight my own battles, right?

20:31.180 --> 20:32.832
And you were just like me in high school,

20:32.983 --> 20:34.637
and you turned out pretty awesome.

20:34.832 --> 20:36.302
Gives a brother hope.

20:37.489 --> 20:39.830
I gotta say, helping Leslie out

20:40.018 --> 20:41.932
has turned out to be quite the job.

20:42.055 --> 20:44.352
I mean, I'm back at my old high school,

20:44.478 --> 20:47.287
I met a girl I like, and
I'm finally over Melanie.

20:47.416 --> 20:49.289
Yeah, pretty amazing coinkydink.

20:49.445 --> 20:52.403
Apropos of nothing, I
believe this is yours.

20:52.528 --> 20:54.891
What? No, I threw this away years ago.

20:55.023 --> 20:58.332
How did you get this?
Adorable that you still ask these things.

21:00.749 --> 21:04.005
Oh, my God. You knew Patty liked me.

21:04.136 --> 21:06.297
There's no way you planned
this whole thing.

21:06.422 --> 21:09.086
Your little office crush
is crushing this office.

21:09.352 --> 21:10.709
You're probably right.

21:10.846 --> 21:12.977
Enjoy the evening.
It's good you got the tux on.

21:13.103 --> 21:14.837
Tomorrow we're going to Vegas.

21:14.979 --> 21:17.232
We got a Casino to rob.
