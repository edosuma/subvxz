<i>(NARRA TOR)
My name is Uhtred, son of Uhtred,</i>

00:04.562 --> 00:08.002
<i>born</i> a <i>Saxon, but raised as</i> a <i>Dane.</i>

00:08.162 --> 00:11.122
<i>I now serve King Alfred of Wessex.</i>

00:11.722 --> 00:14.842
<i>I have married</i> a <i>pious wife
for Alfred.</i>

00:15.002 --> 00:16.442
<i>I have taken on land,</i>

00:16.602 --> 00:17.922
<i>burdened with debt</i>

00:18.082 --> 00:19.682
<i>and cheating workers.</i>

00:21.202 --> 00:24.082
<i>And I killed
the mighty sword-Dane, Ubba.</i>

00:24.242 --> 00:25.882
(SCREAMS)

00:28.402 --> 00:31.122
<i>But with Odda the Elder
wounded in battle,</i>

00:31.282 --> 00:35.442
<i>his son took the credit for my kill.
The truth was ignored--</i>

00:35.602 --> 00:38.642
I fought Ubba man on man
and I killed him.

00:39.202 --> 00:42.842
<i>--And I was forced to my knees
before Alfred's God.</i>

00:43.002 --> 00:45.962
I will lead, but you owe me.

00:46.122 --> 00:48.842
You must lay flat and kiss the cross.

00:49.002 --> 00:50.962
Kiss my arse.

00:51.122 --> 00:53.962
<i>Fate is testing me, but I will survive.</i>

(LEOFRIC)
Certain you want to do this, arseling?

01:45.842 --> 01:48.122
Is there a law against it?

01:48.482 --> 01:51.322
Dressing up as Danes? No.

01:51.482 --> 01:53.842
Plundering Cornwalum, yes.

01:54.002 --> 01:55.602
We're supposed to be at peace.

01:55.762 --> 01:58.842
If I'm to reclaim Bebbanburg,
I'll need an army.

01:59.002 --> 02:02.522
If I am ever to raise an army,
I'll need silver. We go.

02:02.682 --> 02:04.282
I have no quarrel.

02:04.642 --> 02:06.002
Will Odda not miss you?

02:06.162 --> 02:08.642
I'm doing as he asks,
I'm watching you.

02:10.082 --> 02:13.162
He's building Alfred a church at Cynuit,
have you heard?

02:14.722 --> 02:17.242
With an altar of gold, they say.

02:19.122 --> 02:21.442
- Who are they?
- (UHTRED) They belong to Oswald.

02:22.282 --> 02:24.442
Their mother sends them
hoping to shame me

02:24.602 --> 02:26.802
for killing their lying, thieving father.

02:26.962 --> 02:28.282
(BOY GRUNTS)

02:30.282 --> 02:32.722
I see her plan is working.

02:33.642 --> 02:36.482
They're not the first to lose a parent.

02:36.882 --> 02:38.602
They'll live.

(U HTRED BELCHES)

03:00.362 --> 03:02.522
Food is good, Mildrith.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.362
Thank you.

03:05.722 --> 03:07.082
I'm pleased you like it.

03:09.922 --> 03:13.322
I was beginning to believe
you had lost your tongue, wife.

03:13.682 --> 03:16.722
- I was worried.
- I doubt it.

03:16.882 --> 03:18.242
She grieves for the thief.

03:18.922 --> 03:22.682
- Not my business.
- He kills a man I have known all my life.

03:22.842 --> 03:26.162
He refuses to pay wergild
to a family I have known all my life,

03:26.322 --> 03:30.802
and the village my father helped build
now call him Uhtred the Godless.

03:30.962 --> 03:34.202
Not forgetting I refuse to have
my son baptised a Christian.

03:34.362 --> 03:36.202
- I'll excuse myself.
- Sit, please.

03:36.362 --> 03:38.482
- None of this is my business.
- I'll stop.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.242
(SIGHS)

03:49.322 --> 03:51.962
- Tomorrow I'll be gone.
- Gone?

03:52.122 --> 03:55.202
(UHTRED) Should anyone ask,
we're keeping Alfred's kingdom safe.

03:55.562 --> 03:57.842
- Again.
- For how long will you be gone?

03:58.002 --> 04:00.162
- And gone where?
- No idea how long.

04:00.522 --> 04:02.842
- Weeks.
- Your place is here.

04:03.002 --> 04:06.602
Oswald's wife's gone to Bishop Alewold.
The bishop will go to Alfred,

04:06.762 --> 04:08.762
- Alfred will send men--
- I won't pay.

04:08.922 --> 04:12.122
And if men do come calling,
that's what you will tell them.

04:13.162 --> 04:16.402
He was killed because he was a thief.
That's my law.

04:17.242 --> 04:20.841
Leave me and I'll go directly to
the church and have our son blessed.

04:21.242 --> 04:22.602
Then he won't be my son.

04:23.202 --> 04:25.882
May God forgive you
for saying such a thing.

04:26.042 --> 04:28.322
- Which God'?
- What has happened to you?

04:28.482 --> 04:31.602
What has happened to the kindness,
the love you've shown me?

04:31.762 --> 04:33.442
I was made to crawl.

04:33.602 --> 04:37.122
Yes, before God.
We all fall to our knees before God.

04:37.282 --> 04:41.122
I won't forget what Alfred did in the
name of his God. I reject that God.

04:41.722 --> 04:43.602
I will excuse myself.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.242
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

04:48.402 --> 04:50.562
Are you there still?

04:50.962 --> 04:52.482
The man I cared for?

04:53.202 --> 04:58.282
Are you there still,
the woman I ached to plough?

05:05.122 --> 05:08.162
(YOUNGER)
Progress has been made daily, lord.

05:08.602 --> 05:11.402
You must come to Cynuit
and inspect the building work.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.322
Oh, I Will, I Will.

05:13.482 --> 05:14.962
I would like that.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.402
It's impressive enough even now.

05:19.162 --> 05:20.722
Yes.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.442
We have the nave here,

05:23.602 --> 05:26.242
the transept's thus,
and then into the chancel.

05:26.602 --> 05:30.402
With its already famous altar
of solid gold?

05:30.562 --> 05:32.922
It will be gilding, no more, lord.

05:33.082 --> 05:36.402
But you know how tongues wag.
With your permission,

05:36.562 --> 05:39.722
- I'd like to place the altar here.
- Why need my permission?

05:39.882 --> 05:42.802
It's on the exact spot
where Ubba Lothbrokson's buried.

05:42.962 --> 05:46.522
You wish God's altar to be built
over the buried remains of a pagan?

05:46.682 --> 05:49.882
Oh, no, lord. With your permission
we will exhume the remains

05:50.042 --> 05:52.682
and, I don't know,
have them thrown into the river.

05:52.842 --> 05:54.202
You'll exhume the remains

05:54.362 --> 05:57.682
and have them buried elsewhere,
unmarked, but with respect.

05:57.842 --> 05:59.762
It was a joke, lord. A poorjoke.

05:59.922 --> 06:01.922
We must do nothing
to endanger peace.

06:02.082 --> 06:06.402
With respect, lord, I am not the fool
my father at times made me out to be.

06:07.042 --> 06:08.842
Father Beocca, you wish to see me?

06:09.002 --> 06:12.522
- A letter, lord, from Bishop Alewold.
- Private or business?

06:12.682 --> 06:14.322
A matter of law, I was told.

06:14.642 --> 06:19.202
Then read it.
Let Odda's active mind rest.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.122
Can you not read the writing,
Beocca?

06:26.642 --> 06:28.922
It concerns the Ealdorman Uhtred.

06:29.082 --> 06:31.042
He has slain a farmworker

06:31.202 --> 06:34.042
and is refusing to pay the monies
owed to the family,

06:34.202 --> 06:36.162
the wergild.

06:36.802 --> 06:39.322
Would you like me
to investigate further, lord?

06:39.482 --> 06:40.962
No.

06:41.122 --> 06:42.482
No, it is not your place.

06:42.642 --> 06:46.242
Odda, investigate the rights and
wrongs of the matter on my behalf.

06:46.402 --> 06:50.002
I only hope for the sake of Uhtred's
wife, the killing was justified.

06:50.162 --> 06:55.082
Uhtred has always been fair-minded.
I'm sure there are mitigations.

06:55.242 --> 06:57.602
Mm. We shall see.

06:57.762 --> 07:01.482
In the meantime, Odda,
do your best, keep the peace.

07:01.642 --> 07:03.202
Yes, lord.

07:03.722 --> 07:05.522
Father Beocca.

07:06.242 --> 07:07.562
The letter.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.842
You might do well
to examine your loyalties, Father.

07:14.322 --> 07:18.642
My loyalties are to God and to the king,
in that order.

07:18.802 --> 07:20.642
Lord, are you suggesting I'm wrong?

07:20.802 --> 07:23.002
I'm suggesting nothing of the sort.

07:23.162 --> 07:25.242
But I am watching you.

07:26.362 --> 07:28.802
And God is watching all of us.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.962
Uhtred!

07:37.402 --> 07:38.722
Uhtred!

07:40.162 --> 07:42.682
(UHTRED) I'll find the wealth
to pay off the debt.

07:42.842 --> 07:45.562
We want the same thing,
the land of our birth.

07:45.722 --> 07:47.362
Yours won't be taken from you.

07:47.962 --> 07:49.762
Mine?

07:50.922 --> 07:54.922
- Are you no longer the ealdorman?
- I'll never be accepted as an ealdorman.

07:55.602 --> 07:59.162
- Not here.
- Then I beg you for one last time,

07:59.322 --> 08:01.162
change your ways, Uhtred.

08:01.962 --> 08:05.962
If you allow God into your heart,
he will guide you.

08:06.122 --> 08:08.642
I can never become the man
you want me to be.

08:08.802 --> 08:12.122
- You could try.
- I would despise that man.

08:12.282 --> 08:13.842
(LEOFRIC) Arseling!

08:18.482 --> 08:20.402
(BABY coonve)

08:25.602 --> 08:27.802
I have loved you.

08:30.002 --> 08:32.042
Don't pray for me.

08:38.682 --> 08:41.322
Did you hump her goodbye,
arseling?

08:41.482 --> 08:44.442
I want to have left Wessex
by tonight.

08:46.282 --> 08:49.402
(LEOFRIC) You're gonna have to ride
faster than that, arseling.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.242
Hyah!Hyah!

09:35.362 --> 09:38.962
No one is to wear these
till we have crossed into Cornwalum.

09:39.762 --> 09:41.922
What you can do is polish them,

09:42.082 --> 09:45.722
so that when you do wear them,
they will be seen, clearly.

09:46.402 --> 09:48.562
And you'll be feared.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.722
You're going to find out
what it's like to be a Dane.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.122
Every man stand where he is.
No one move.

09:54.282 --> 09:57.642
You! Stay where you are.

09:58.242 --> 10:00.122
Do I know you?

10:01.562 --> 10:03.442
Lower your hood.

10:04.202 --> 10:05.722
I said, lower your hood.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.482
Aethelwold.

10:22.642 --> 10:23.962
(STUTTERS)

10:24.122 --> 10:26.162
I merely want to come with you.

10:26.322 --> 10:28.762
To be part of your adventure.

10:29.202 --> 10:30.762
I wanted it to be a surprise.

10:31.442 --> 10:33.762
He cannot be here.
He cannot hold his tongue.

10:35.122 --> 10:37.442
- <i>L</i> say we kill him.
- Kill me? (CHUCKLES)

10:38.482 --> 10:41.242
You can't kill me.
I'm the rightful king, you fool.

10:41.402 --> 10:44.562
- Not here. Leofric!
- Then I will drag him into Cornwalum!

10:44.722 --> 10:46.042
- Not now!
- You can't.

10:46.202 --> 10:48.722
Uhtred, you owe me a favour,
I call it in now.

10:48.882 --> 10:52.282
If Alfred hears of Christians
raiding Cornwalum, we'll be killed.

10:52.442 --> 10:54.122
He guarantees that outcome.

10:54.282 --> 10:56.482
Leofric, I am a changed man.
I swear.

10:56.802 --> 10:59.122
We kill him. He will not be missed.

11:00.322 --> 11:01.802
We take him with us.

11:03.002 --> 11:06.042
I owe him. He's my responsibility.

11:10.682 --> 11:14.202
- He has my protection.
- And who will protect the rest of us?

11:18.202 --> 11:19.722
I've never seen him so angry.

11:19.882 --> 11:23.242
- You'll clean mail, tend to the horses.
- Anything.

11:23.602 --> 11:25.442
You'll wipe our arses if I say so.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.122
Of course.

11:27.442 --> 11:30.762
And I'm gathering the moss
and dock leaves as you speak, lord.

11:49.522 --> 11:51.722
What do you know of Cornwalum?

11:52.642 --> 11:54.842
That it's not Wessex.

11:56.562 --> 11:59.322
The Wessex-Cornwalum border
is this river,

11:59.722 --> 12:03.202
- the Tamar river.
- Which is why we are camped here.

12:04.002 --> 12:06.002
It flows north to south

12:06.322 --> 12:11.122
and Cornwalum itself
has a coastline shaped like a leg.

12:11.282 --> 12:12.602
- They are traders?
- Yes.

12:12.762 --> 12:15.682
On the north coast
to the Welsh kingdoms and Ireland.

12:16.642 --> 12:19.002
And on the south to the Franks.

12:19.162 --> 12:23.682
- How do you know this?
- I'm an educated man, Leofric.

12:23.842 --> 12:25.842
I simply enjoy hiding the fact.

12:26.482 --> 12:28.322
You do it well.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.242
- Do they have a king?
- More than one.

12:33.402 --> 12:37.122
- Fierce fighters?
- Have no fear, Leofric,

12:37.282 --> 12:39.122
we are Danes.

12:42.882 --> 12:45.602
I want to be blooded, in battle.

12:45.762 --> 12:48.202
(CHUCKLES) Don't worry, boy,

12:48.762 --> 12:51.042
you'll be first in line.

12:51.202 --> 12:53.162
I look forward to it.

13:09.602 --> 13:11.002
(WOMAN) Good day, lord.

13:12.842 --> 13:16.122
Tell your master Ealdorman Odda
is here, with Bishop Alewold.

13:16.682 --> 13:18.002
(WOMAN) Yes, lord.

13:18.922 --> 13:20.602
(YOUNGER) Quickly.

13:23.162 --> 13:24.482
(EXHALES)

13:24.642 --> 13:28.202
It's not the most desirable farmstead
I've seen.

13:32.122 --> 13:36.882
Ealdorman Odda, Bishop Alewold,
a pleasant surprise.

13:37.522 --> 13:39.522
May I offer a refreshment?

13:39.682 --> 13:41.762
We are here in the king's business.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.122
'Tis with your husband.

13:44.722 --> 13:47.802
- Is he here?
- He is not.

13:48.282 --> 13:50.042
Can he be fetched, my dear?

13:56.322 --> 13:59.122
All crucifixes and crosses.

14:00.642 --> 14:04.362
You are God-fearing Christians
no more.

14:08.322 --> 14:10.122
You are Danes now.

14:10.282 --> 14:11.642
Pagans.

14:12.082 --> 14:15.642
You don't cross yourself
nor look to the heavens.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.042
(CHUCKLES)

14:18.202 --> 14:20.122
Let's make ourselves rich!

14:20.282 --> 14:21.722
(MEN) Yeah!

14:40.802 --> 14:43.082
(MILDRITH)
My husband is protecting our kingdom.

14:43.242 --> 14:45.562
From whom? We're at peace.

14:45.722 --> 14:47.802
He only said
he was doing Alfred's work.

14:47.962 --> 14:49.482
He doesn't trust the Danes.

14:49.642 --> 14:51.962
He thinks he knows better
than the king.

14:52.122 --> 14:54.162
Your man, Leofric,
will give you detail.

14:54.882 --> 14:56.802
- Yes.
- (ALEWOLD) Odda.

14:56.962 --> 15:00.602
It's not the child's fault
that she was married off to a tyrant

15:00.762 --> 15:03.762
- and a fool.
- (ODDA) No.

15:05.002 --> 15:06.842
Of course not.

15:08.362 --> 15:12.482
Mildrith, it is with great reluctance

15:12.642 --> 15:15.402
that I must serve you with this letter.

15:15.722 --> 15:19.882
For your husband, upon his return.
He must settle the wergild

15:20.042 --> 15:22.962
for Oswald's death
or face confiscation of his property.

15:25.162 --> 15:28.722
Which is also my property.

15:30.002 --> 15:33.282
If you're in need, my father's house
will always be your house.

15:33.842 --> 15:35.682
How is Lord Odda faring?

15:35.842 --> 15:38.482
- Well, I hope.
- Frail.

15:38.642 --> 15:40.602
He's still very frail.

15:40.762 --> 15:42.722
The blow would have killed
many a man.

15:45.762 --> 15:48.602
(ALEWOLD) Take consolation, lady,

15:49.082 --> 15:54.802
that should your land be confiscated,
it is the church that'll benefit.

16:07.802 --> 16:09.322
No! No, no, no, please don't!

16:12.602 --> 16:15.082
Where is it buried?
Where's the silver?

16:17.202 --> 16:19.042
Where is it?

16:19.202 --> 16:20.802
(UHTRED) These people have nothing.

16:21.242 --> 16:22.562
(MAN) Please.

16:26.522 --> 16:28.842
Five days and nothing.

16:29.002 --> 16:30.402
There is time yet.

16:31.322 --> 16:34.962
We're not the first Danes they've seen.
I need silver.

16:35.122 --> 16:37.762
- We keep looking.
- What if the whole of Cornwalum

16:37.922 --> 16:40.242
- has been sacked already?
- We keep looking.

16:40.562 --> 16:42.602
We keep heading west.

16:45.282 --> 16:46.682
(SIGHS)

17:14.962 --> 17:16.962
Do they want to speak?

17:20.842 --> 17:23.561
Five men, to match theirs.

17:24.882 --> 17:27.242
And only I speak.

17:27.402 --> 17:29.002
Aethelwold?

17:29.162 --> 17:30.602
I heard.

17:30.762 --> 17:33.722
Only the Great Uhtred speaks.

17:51.002 --> 17:53.562
I am Brother Asser.

17:53.722 --> 17:57.442
I bring you a gift, from my king.

17:58.842 --> 18:00.722
From King Peredur.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.082
King who?

18:04.242 --> 18:06.042
King Peredur.

18:06.202 --> 18:07.562
Of the Britons.

18:08.762 --> 18:10.082
Never heard of him.

18:10.242 --> 18:13.082
I assure you
my king has heard of you.

18:13.242 --> 18:18.322
A troop of Danes raiding villages
in Cornwalum does not go unnoticed.

18:18.482 --> 18:21.122
Why does Peredur send me
these miserable offerings?

18:21.282 --> 18:23.882
A gesture of peace, a token.

18:25.282 --> 18:29.762
Our king has been attacked by
a fellow Briton and neighbour, Callyn,

18:29.922 --> 18:32.922
whose forces have seized
the fort guarding our land.

18:33.082 --> 18:35.562
I am sent to tell you
Peredur will pay you well

18:35.722 --> 18:38.282
to help him recapture this fort.

18:38.722 --> 18:41.322
Pay us well? How much?

18:41.482 --> 18:44.682
I do not know the sum,
but I am sure he will be generous.

18:45.322 --> 18:46.642
He has silver?

18:47.282 --> 18:49.362
He is a king.

18:50.642 --> 18:52.642
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

19:28.602 --> 19:30.562

Alfred he is not.

19:43.322 --> 19:45.202
The king greets you.

19:45.522 --> 19:46.922
He does?

19:47.082 --> 19:49.202
- I hear nothing.
- You are pagans.

19:49.362 --> 19:52.642
The king is Christian, and will
only speak with you through me.

19:52.802 --> 19:55.442
If you would come forward
and pay your respects.

20:01.002 --> 20:04.082
Please inform the king
Danes don't bow to Christians.

20:05.722 --> 20:09.642
This fort you want us to recapture,
it's defended by how many Britons?

20:09.962 --> 20:11.802
And what price will you pay?

20:15.122 --> 20:16.442
It would be much simpler

20:16.602 --> 20:19.762
- if the king addressed me directly.
- (LEOFRIC) Easy.

20:25.122 --> 20:28.642
They have between 4O and 50 men.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.722
No more than 50.

20:32.602 --> 20:35.482
We are 30 fighting men.

20:36.162 --> 20:38.122
And we are 20.

20:38.762 --> 20:40.082
How much in silver?

20:40.602 --> 20:42.762
One hundred pieces of silver.

20:43.122 --> 20:45.842
I won't bargain. I'll tell you the price.

20:46.242 --> 20:48.922
- Four hundred pieces of silver.
- An absurd sum.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.002
Is Peredur a king or not?

20:54.322 --> 20:56.362
I will call for Queen lseult.

20:56.522 --> 21:00.362
Lord, perhaps instead,
you should take a moment and pray

21:00.522 --> 21:01.962
- for guidance--
- lseult!

21:03.642 --> 21:05.202
You are needed.

21:24.922 --> 21:29.162
I am blessed with two wives,
two queens.

21:30.242 --> 21:32.962
Iseult is a shadow queen.

21:34.882 --> 21:38.082
You know what I require of you,
of course you do.

22:06.682 --> 22:08.522
Who are you...

22:09.962 --> 22:12.482
...and what will you do for the king?

22:16.122 --> 22:18.522
I am Uhtred Ragnarson.

22:19.442 --> 22:21.962
I'm here to fight for your king

22:22.122 --> 22:24.562
if he pays me what I'm worth.

23:15.802 --> 23:17.802
He is the one.

23:34.122 --> 23:36.802
You're fortunate to have such a wife.

23:36.962 --> 23:39.402
She is not to hump.

23:40.202 --> 23:42.042
She's too valuable.

23:45.962 --> 23:52.482
Four hundred (SIGHS) pieces of silver.

23:54.722 --> 23:56.042
Agreed.

23:56.202 --> 23:59.282
- (UHTRED) I'll see it.
- You'll see it once the fort is taken.

23:59.442 --> 24:02.522
- No, I'll see it now.
- All of my wealth is hidden

24:02.682 --> 24:04.002
within the fort.

24:04.162 --> 24:06.122
Then your enemy has it.

24:06.282 --> 24:08.162
Well hidden.

24:08.322 --> 24:10.842
You have your price,
you have my terms.

24:11.282 --> 24:13.402
I know you'll accept.

24:13.962 --> 24:17.922
I know you can smell the silver.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.362
Danes. Hm?

24:21.682 --> 24:25.122
You have a nose
for blood and silver.

24:25.282 --> 24:27.242
And women.

24:27.802 --> 24:32.082
And so I will add to the price
my queen.

24:34.082 --> 24:36.962
This queen. (LAUGHS)

24:41.122 --> 24:44.482
If we win back the fort and you're
lying about the silver, I'll kill you.

24:44.642 --> 24:47.762
Which is why I do not lie.

24:51.042 --> 24:54.282
Call the men up. We stay here.

24:57.682 --> 25:00.602
I'll dream about that shadow queen.

25:01.122 --> 25:03.122
(LEOFRIC) You told her your name,

25:03.282 --> 25:04.602
and word travels.

25:04.762 --> 25:06.202
(ASSER) Uhtred Ragnarson.

25:09.802 --> 25:12.802
I notice that you have some Saxons
amongst your ranks.

25:12.962 --> 25:14.282
Some. From Mercia.

25:14.442 --> 25:17.242
Rather fight than work in the fields.
Pay is better.

25:17.402 --> 25:19.882
He'd like to attack
at the earliest opportunity.

25:20.042 --> 25:22.002
He won't feed you more than a night.

25:22.162 --> 25:23.682
How Christian of him.

25:24.122 --> 25:27.002
He would like to be a man of God,

25:27.162 --> 25:31.162
but as you have witnessed,
he cannot let go of his pagan ways.

25:32.002 --> 25:33.642
The Queen lseult.

25:34.002 --> 25:36.242
She is a gwrach.

25:36.682 --> 25:38.202
A sorceress.

25:38.842 --> 25:40.162
And what are her powers?

25:41.362 --> 25:45.042
Peredur believes
she can see into the future.

25:45.762 --> 25:48.802
For as long as she remains a virgin.

25:49.322 --> 25:53.242
- What do you believe?
- I know the devil exists.

25:53.882 --> 25:58.642
Hiding within beauty is a trick
he will use often, I'm sure.

25:59.802 --> 26:02.002
Tell the king to have his men ready.

26:08.762 --> 26:13.602
Peredur, any in the fort
who try to escape are yours, yes?

26:13.762 --> 26:17.522
You will do your part, Dane,
I will do mine.

26:20.482 --> 26:22.282
Walk on. Advance.

(LEOFRIC) Let's scare the shit
out of these bastard Britons,

26:27.882 --> 26:30.602
see if they have the stomach for this.

26:38.002 --> 26:39.362
Hold.

26:41.402 --> 26:42.962
We hold here.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.682
Why would they leave a fortress
to face us?

26:54.202 --> 26:55.922

26:57.682 --> 27:01.042

they're prepared to leave the fortress.

27:46.082 --> 27:48.082
They are Danes!

27:48.402 --> 27:50.482
Real Danes!

27:53.682 --> 27:56.082
Stand still! Hold!

27:57.842 --> 27:59.442

27:59.602 --> 28:02.162
- (UHTRED) They're Danes!
- What do you care?

28:02.322 --> 28:05.242
You people will fight anyone for money,
even yourselves.

28:05.402 --> 28:08.642
- You lied to me.
- Think of the silver.

28:08.802 --> 28:11.402
The queen has seen your victory,
so fight!

28:11.562 --> 28:12.882
Uhtred.

28:17.162 --> 28:20.762
He's a sword-Dane. A lord of war.

28:21.522 --> 28:23.842
(AETHELWOLD)
If the lord of war wants to talk,

28:24.162 --> 28:26.362
may I suggest we listen.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.962
Name yourself.

29:05.002 --> 29:07.522
I'm Uhtred Ragnarson.

29:07.922 --> 29:09.242
Who are you?

29:09.682 --> 29:13.882
Skorpa, of The White Horse.

29:14.962 --> 29:18.122
You are the Uhtred Ragnarson
who was at Cynuit?

29:19.962 --> 29:24.482
- I am.
- The Saxon son of Earl Ragnar?

29:25.162 --> 29:26.842
Yes.

29:27.442 --> 29:29.442
You will not defeat me.

29:30.402 --> 29:31.722
You know this.

29:31.882 --> 29:34.962
Perhaps not,
but I could kill half your men trying.

29:35.122 --> 29:36.642
Oh.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.562
Yes.

29:40.202 --> 29:41.602
Yes, you could.

29:43.162 --> 29:48.202
Then it would be best for us both
if you did not try.

29:49.202 --> 29:53.562
Lord. Lord, I fear what will happen
if they are allowed to speak.

29:53.722 --> 29:56.882
Then go to them,
listen to what they're saying.

29:57.322 --> 30:00.402
My presence, lord, would serve only
to antagonize the Dane.

30:00.562 --> 30:02.522
Uhtred Ragnarson!

30:02.682 --> 30:04.642
What is happening here?

30:05.042 --> 30:07.802
They must leave my kingdom or die!

The queen saw victory.

30:12.962 --> 30:15.082
I pray, lord.

What is your battle price?

30:17.122 --> 30:18.442

in the fortress.

- Somewhere.

We kill his men,

we spare the king,

30:50.842 --> 30:54.242
he takes us to his wealth.

30:56.962 --> 30:58.802
Half and half?

31:02.842 --> 31:07.082
I will advance, you will turn

31:08.122 --> 31:10.842
and we will attack together.

of the king.

It is over.

Your wealth.

- My wealth for my life?
- Your wealth and your shadow queen.

as a warlord,

you will be spared.

35:03.482 --> 35:05.082
or you will die.

35:06.202 --> 35:08.002

with a golden altar?

36:25.602 --> 36:26.922
At Cynuit.

36:28.162 --> 36:31.002
To celebrate the killing of Ubba,

36:31.602 --> 36:33.642
I hear they're building a church.

36:33.802 --> 36:35.442
Who's been telling you this?

36:35.602 --> 36:37.202
Men,

36:37.682 --> 36:39.722
begging to live.

36:39.882 --> 36:41.202
Would say anything.

36:41.642 --> 36:43.442
That's where you'll go, to Cynuit?

36:44.842 --> 36:49.802
Well, I have ships to repair,
the coastline here has been murderous.

37:03.562 --> 37:04.922
(LEOFRIC) How do we do this?

37:05.522 --> 37:06.842
How do we share?

37:08.322 --> 37:11.762
We don't share.

37:14.122 --> 37:16.122
Oh, we can fight

37:16.682 --> 37:18.522
and some of us will die,

37:18.882 --> 37:21.922
including your queen.

37:41.842 --> 37:43.162
Uhtred Ragnarson,

37:44.082 --> 37:46.162
keep your sword in its scabbard.

37:46.322 --> 37:47.642
Wise queen.

37:47.802 --> 37:49.442
She stays with me.

37:55.482 --> 37:58.242
- She stays with me!
- Do nothing!

37:58.402 --> 38:00.282
(SKORPA LAUGHS)

38:06.522 --> 38:08.282
(WHISPERING)

38:14.362 --> 38:15.682
Uhtred, no! Uhtred!

38:15.842 --> 38:19.322
- (UHTRED) They have our treasure.
- I'll not fight these Danes for silver.

38:19.642 --> 38:21.562
For king, yes, but not for silver.

38:21.722 --> 38:25.002
I need to raise an army and they get
away further with every second!

38:25.162 --> 38:27.282
I'll not allow half these men
or more to die.

38:27.442 --> 38:29.322
(ISEULT) I can give you what you need.

38:30.562 --> 38:32.282
There is more.

38:32.802 --> 38:34.482
Silver.

38:35.122 --> 38:37.122
(CHICKENS CLUCKING)

38:45.682 --> 38:47.002
(CHUCKLES)

38:51.002 --> 38:54.922
What did he whisper, Skorpa,
when he was leaving?

38:57.722 --> 39:00.642
I will tell you
when I believe you need to know.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.562
How was I?

39:10.082 --> 39:11.922
As a warrior?

39:13.202 --> 39:14.762
Aethelwold,

39:15.722 --> 39:18.642
you are as much a warrior
as you are a king.

39:38.002 --> 39:39.642
This isn't part of the plunder.

39:41.362 --> 39:43.762
It's a holy cross.
It goes back to the church.

39:43.922 --> 39:45.882
There'll be blessings.

39:46.682 --> 39:48.202
But the rest...

39:49.922 --> 39:51.522
...it's all ours.

39:56.882 --> 40:00.882
- Home?
- Wessex. And our separate ways.

40:01.042 --> 40:03.602
There's a bishop I must see.

40:48.042 --> 40:51.002
(ISEULT) I've never seen a village
like this before.

40:51.682 --> 40:54.122
(UHTRED)
We will be here forjust the day.

40:59.762 --> 41:02.762
- Who are you?
- I'll speak with the Bishop Alewold.

41:02.922 --> 41:04.602
Bishop Alewold is at prayer.

41:04.922 --> 41:06.562
- He'll see me.
- He's at prayer

41:06.722 --> 41:09.482
- and cannot be disturbed.
- Alewold. Bishop Alewold.

41:10.202 --> 41:11.922
What is this?

41:12.082 --> 41:14.282
Get out. Out.

41:14.442 --> 41:16.762
We-- We're--
We're busy with our work.

41:16.922 --> 41:18.642
So I see.

41:18.802 --> 41:20.122
I said, get out.

41:22.602 --> 41:25.202
- (UHTRED CHUCKLES)
- I know you.

41:26.002 --> 41:27.322
Uhtred.

41:28.082 --> 41:30.162
The Godless, yes.

41:30.322 --> 41:34.362
And my wife, through her father,
has inherited a debt to the church.

41:34.522 --> 41:36.002
Oh, yes.

41:36.162 --> 41:38.522
A substantial debt, I recall.

41:38.682 --> 41:40.922
- Which I would now discharge.
- You would?

41:41.082 --> 41:44.202
Very well,
as you see we're busy with--

41:45.282 --> 41:47.202
(GASPS)

41:49.922 --> 41:53.082
That's Irish work.

41:53.242 --> 41:56.122
Hlookslfish.

41:56.282 --> 41:58.402
And its weight.

41:58.562 --> 42:01.762
A thing of beauty and of great value.

42:01.922 --> 42:04.322
It seemed a fitting way
of settling the debt.

42:04.482 --> 42:08.082
If you'll accept, of course.
If not, I'll put it in the smith's fire.

42:08.242 --> 42:12.602
Iaccept
On behalf of the church, I accept.

42:15.402 --> 42:18.842
I trust I can rely
upon your good judgement

42:19.002 --> 42:23.122
in dismissing the matter
of my sen/ant Oswald's wergild.

42:24.162 --> 42:25.602
He was a thief.

42:26.122 --> 42:30.442
- His family will swear otherwise.
- My people will swear he was.

42:31.002 --> 42:34.642
And time will be wasted with no end.

42:37.002 --> 42:41.282
In that case,
consider all matters resolved.

42:41.442 --> 42:43.082
Bless you.

43:24.402 --> 43:26.802
I've been praying daily
for your safe return.

43:36.642 --> 43:38.402
Who's this?

43:39.602 --> 43:41.242
She's a queen.

43:42.002 --> 43:44.762
Queen of where? Of whom?

43:44.922 --> 43:46.722
(UHTRED) Britons.

43:47.882 --> 43:49.882
(BABY CRYING)

43:56.922 --> 44:00.002
Uhtred, you walked by your son
without a look.

44:02.642 --> 44:04.202
Is he baptised now?

44:04.362 --> 44:05.882
Yes.

44:06.402 --> 44:07.762
Against my wishes.

44:07.922 --> 44:11.442
I have done nothing
that requires forgiveness.

44:13.082 --> 44:15.522
- What's her name?
- I am called lseult.

44:15.682 --> 44:17.642
I'm speaking with my husband.

44:17.802 --> 44:19.642
You can kindly remain silent.

44:19.802 --> 44:22.122

and in need of rest.

44:22.282 --> 44:25.362
(SCOFFS) I am not your servant.

44:25.522 --> 44:28.682
Do not speak to me as if I were.
I am your wife.

44:28.842 --> 44:31.522
You are no longer a part
of Uhtred's path.

44:33.402 --> 44:35.002
It is true.

44:37.322 --> 44:39.882
Out. Out!

44:40.042 --> 44:43.202
This queen can sleep
with the animals.

44:47.842 --> 44:50.162
You should know
that your land is safe.

44:50.322 --> 44:53.082
I've seen Bishop Alewold.
The debt's settled, all of it.

44:53.962 --> 44:57.562
That's what I've come to tell you,
nothing more.

44:58.402 --> 45:00.242
And what of Oswald's wergild?

45:00.402 --> 45:01.962
That too is settled.

45:02.122 --> 45:04.682
His family won't receive a penny.

45:04.842 --> 45:07.562
(MILDRITH) Then you can explain that
to the king's council.

It's finished.

45:16.202 --> 45:17.962
Everything.

45:20.922 --> 45:23.962
Before I left
I said that I've loved you,

45:24.602 --> 45:26.202
and it's true.

45:26.562 --> 45:33.282
You'll not speak of us in this way
and in the presence of a pagan whore.

45:33.442 --> 45:35.522
She's with me.

45:38.242 --> 45:43.042

or with the animals?

(BLEATING)

45:48.562 --> 45:50.642
You chose the company
of pigs and a goat

45:50.802 --> 45:52.722
over your wife and son?

45:58.602 --> 46:00.802
My wife's a good woman.

46:02.162 --> 46:06.162
She loves her God and it's hard for her
to be with the like of me.

46:06.522 --> 46:08.042
(SNICKERS)

46:09.682 --> 46:14.442
If the marriage is to be ended, I must
become used to life without my son.

46:27.082 --> 46:29.642
I'm here because I choose you.

46:33.242 --> 46:36.002
Though I won't keep you
against your will.

46:43.402 --> 46:45.162
What?

46:51.122 --> 46:53.802
I will be with you, Uhtred,

46:54.522 --> 46:57.482
from now until the very end.

46:59.682 --> 47:01.962
That is what I see.

47:09.042 --> 47:13.362
I want you to see my home,
my land in the north.

47:15.122 --> 47:19.322
It is this Alfred
who directs you for that.

47:19.802 --> 47:22.442
You must give in to fate.

47:23.242 --> 47:25.402
Attend his Witan.

47:29.442 --> 47:32.642
Will you sleep alongside me tonight,
under the furs?

47:34.482 --> 47:38.362
- Sleep?
- Nothing more.

47:40.122 --> 47:42.202
I would like that.

47:45.642 --> 47:48.362
As the only other source of warmth
would be a goat.

48:14.082 --> 48:15.922
With the Child.

48:17.922 --> 48:20.682
We will leave for Lord Odda's estate.

48:22.962 --> 48:26.242
I would like you with me,
but it is your decision.

48:27.002 --> 48:30.322
I know how important it is to be
amongst the people who care for you.

48:34.282 --> 48:36.722
I would not wish to leave you.

48:51.002 --> 48:54.482
The very day I'm told
that my home is my own

48:54.802 --> 48:57.562
is the day I decide I must leave.

49:37.602 --> 49:42.362
Oh, Lord, grant wisdom
to your servants gathered here.

49:42.922 --> 49:48.242
Help them to decide what is right,
what is just and what is fair.

49:48.802 --> 49:51.242
Grant us this, oh, Lord.

- Beocca.

50:10.842 --> 50:13.282
Quickly. You're late.

50:13.442 --> 50:17.002
You were sent for days ago.
You should have been here on time.

50:17.162 --> 50:19.522
Since when has
my presence been so important?

50:19.682 --> 50:21.642
- Who is she?
- She's with me.

50:21.802 --> 50:24.082
Is she part of your plunder?

50:24.642 --> 50:26.322
What's been said?

50:26.482 --> 50:28.522
You will hear it all soon enough.

50:28.682 --> 50:31.682
Now, we must go
and you must be respectful.

50:31.842 --> 50:34.042
Now more than ever.

50:38.202 --> 50:42.642
And as local thanes skimp
in their duty to repair the bridges,

50:42.962 --> 50:47.602
I wish to ask of the king
to appoint an official

50:47.762 --> 50:50.402
to survey the kingdom's roads.

50:50.562 --> 50:53.962
The bridge on the road
out of Abingdon, for example,

50:54.482 --> 50:57.202
is in such a state of disrepair

50:57.362 --> 51:00.482
- Now's the time, lord.
- It is now dangerous for man or...

51:00.642 --> 51:03.082
What reason do I have
to beg for mercy?

51:03.242 --> 51:04.962
- Quiet now.
- ls it Cornwalum?

51:05.122 --> 51:07.522
- Respect.
- (MAN) --remains disinterested.

51:07.682 --> 51:10.242
We shall talk of bridges later.

51:11.122 --> 51:13.722
- Beocca, what is this?
- (YOUNGER) Be quiet there!

51:14.802 --> 51:16.522
Face your king.

51:17.042 --> 51:20.962
- Come.
- There is an urgent matter

51:21.122 --> 51:25.042
which, with the Witan's permission,
we shall deal with now.

51:37.922 --> 51:39.802
Ealdorman Uhtred,

51:40.602 --> 51:44.122
also known in your parish
as Uhtred the Godless,

51:45.202 --> 51:49.122
you are on this day charged
with taking a troop of the king's men

51:49.282 --> 51:50.682
into Cornwalum,

51:50.842 --> 51:54.842
there making war against the Britons
without your king's consent.

51:55.602 --> 51:59.922
You are also charged with joining
forces with the Dane called Skorpa,

52:01.122 --> 52:05.002
to murder Christian folk
in Cornwalum,

52:05.162 --> 52:10.602
despite these folk all living in peace
with Alfred and with Wessex.

52:11.642 --> 52:13.802
All this is proven with oaths.

52:14.122 --> 52:17.162
And the punishment
for these crimes is death.

52:19.282 --> 52:20.802
Who swears these oaths?

52:20.962 --> 52:22.802
- We shall get to that.
- Show me.

52:22.962 --> 52:24.922
- Who swears?
- (ASSER) I,

52:25.082 --> 52:28.082
Brother Asser, swear these oaths.

52:28.482 --> 52:31.122
- Uhtred, to your knees.
- Never.

52:31.282 --> 52:34.442
We were patrolling your borders
and protecting your kingdom.

52:34.602 --> 52:37.562
There is more to my story, lord,
if I may.

52:37.722 --> 52:40.562
- Time to beg.
- Let him speak. Let's hear his story.

52:40.922 --> 52:45.362
On my way to make this complaint
to King Alfred,

52:45.522 --> 52:47.242
I came via Cynuit.

52:48.122 --> 52:51.882
And such a sight
I hope never to see again.

52:52.642 --> 52:55.802
For where the church
to commemorate Lord Odda's victory

52:55.962 --> 52:57.602
over Ubba was to be built,

52:57.762 --> 53:01.522
I saw devastation, destruction,

53:01.682 --> 53:05.802
and the charred remains
of 15 monks or more.

53:05.962 --> 53:07.722
Men have told me

53:07.882 --> 53:09.602
that this evil was the work

53:09.762 --> 53:13.642
of the very same Skorpa
who was in Cornwalum

53:13.802 --> 53:17.642
and that with him, once more,
was the Ealdorman Uhtred.

53:17.802 --> 53:20.282
- This man!
- No! No, these are lies, lord.

53:20.442 --> 53:23.722
He lies with every breath. Hear me.
Let me speak the truth.

53:23.882 --> 53:25.562
We are the Witan,

53:26.122 --> 53:28.962
and we shall behave
in the way of a Witan.

53:31.922 --> 53:34.722
The ealdorman is entitled to respond.

53:34.882 --> 53:36.482
(UHTRED) Yes, I was at Cynuit.

53:36.642 --> 53:39.682
I was at Cynuit once, and once only.

53:40.522 --> 53:45.122
I was at Cynuit on the day that I,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg, killed Ubba.

53:47.802 --> 53:50.082
I look around this hall

53:50.242 --> 53:53.322
and into the eyes of the warriors
who know this to be true.

53:55.482 --> 53:58.202
And that is the only occasion
I was at Cynuit.

53:58.362 --> 54:00.242
(ALFRED) We are here...

54:01.442 --> 54:03.562
We are here to deliverjudgement

54:03.722 --> 54:06.802
on the murder of King Peredur
and the Britons of Cornwalum.

54:06.962 --> 54:09.562
- If I can speak of--
- There's a further witness.

54:09.722 --> 54:12.162
What if Peredur's queen was
to stand in front

54:12.322 --> 54:14.722
and tell you that Peredur lied
and cheated us?

54:14.882 --> 54:17.842
She's a shadow queen, a pagan.
Her words are meaningless.

54:18.002 --> 54:19.442
Is the truth not important?

54:19.602 --> 54:21.322
- Lord.
- Odda, we shall move on.

54:21.482 --> 54:24.722
- There is a further witness.
- Yes, lord. Bring the prisoner.

54:25.482 --> 54:27.442
(CROWD GASPS)

54:32.082 --> 54:34.842
- What is this?
- Odda wants you to die as a traitor,

54:35.002 --> 54:37.842
- You will stand separate.
- and you will die.

54:38.002 --> 54:40.842
If it's Valhalla you want,
I'll do my best to give it.

54:41.002 --> 54:42.682
I said you will stand separate.

54:47.162 --> 54:48.602
Leofric,

54:49.322 --> 54:51.042
you've sworn your oath.

54:51.522 --> 54:53.002
And you will tell the truth?

54:53.162 --> 54:54.522
I Will, lord.

54:55.082 --> 54:56.482
God is merciful.

54:57.642 --> 54:59.122
You are a man of Wessex

54:59.282 --> 55:01.242
and have been loyal to the king?

55:01.402 --> 55:04.122
I am loyal to the king, lord. Always.

55:04.962 --> 55:07.802
Were you in Cornwalum
with the Ealdorman Uhtred?

55:10.162 --> 55:11.922
I was.

55:12.802 --> 55:17.002
Did you kill and plunder Peredur
and his Britons?

55:17.162 --> 55:20.722
- I did.
- Leofric, have you now donated

55:20.882 --> 55:23.682
your share of the plunder
to the church?

55:24.362 --> 55:25.962
I have, lord.

55:26.122 --> 55:27.682
And have begged forgiveness.

55:29.962 --> 55:31.602
The Witan hears you, Leofric.

55:35.162 --> 55:36.922
Whom did you follow into battle?

55:40.242 --> 55:41.842
I went willingly, lord.

55:42.002 --> 55:45.362
No. Uhtred led, you followed.

55:45.522 --> 55:48.882
- He's the ealdorman, he is to blame.
- I share the blame, lord.

55:49.042 --> 55:51.322
- No, he is responsible.
- Irresponsible.

55:51.482 --> 55:52.882
He will pay with his life.

55:53.042 --> 55:55.522
- For the last time, beg.
- No, I will not beg.

55:55.882 --> 56:00.042
I will fall to my knees for no man,
no king and no Christian God.

56:06.002 --> 56:07.682
(UHTRED GRUNTS)

56:09.922 --> 56:11.842
He must pay, with his life.

56:13.042 --> 56:16.082
Lord, if I may make a plea
to the king and the Witan.

56:16.242 --> 56:19.682
- I have not yet finished.
- I beg your pardon, but ifl may.

56:20.922 --> 56:24.362
It is clear that, like me,
the arseling here is guilty.

56:24.522 --> 56:26.002
Thank you, my friend. (GRUNTS)

56:27.162 --> 56:32.162
It is also clear that he is too proud
and too stupid to repent,

56:32.322 --> 56:33.962
and as a consequence will die.

56:34.122 --> 56:36.682
He will die
for leading men to treachery.

56:37.042 --> 56:39.002
(LEOFRIC) Because of my own guilt

56:39.642 --> 56:42.602
and because of my respect for Uhtred
as a warrior,

56:43.162 --> 56:45.322
I request that he dies at my sword.

56:50.602 --> 56:53.882
You wish to become executioner,
Leofric?

56:54.282 --> 56:56.882
My plea is for a fight to the death, lord.

56:57.042 --> 56:58.562
Me against the arseling.

56:59.402 --> 57:02.042
If God is with me, I will be the victor,

57:02.202 --> 57:05.482
and the ealdorman is allowed to die
as a warrior should.

57:05.642 --> 57:08.202
And if he wins this fight to the death,
what then?

57:08.362 --> 57:13.402
He will not. It would take
God's intervention for him to beat me.

57:13.562 --> 57:15.482
(AETHELWOLD) Let them fight, lord.

57:16.002 --> 57:18.122
Let God decide.

57:20.162 --> 57:23.242
Lord. Lord, it is clear
the guilt lies with Uhtred.

57:24.122 --> 57:25.722
(MAN) This is the way.

57:25.882 --> 57:27.682
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

57:32.762 --> 57:37.002
Leofric, you have spoken well.

57:38.402 --> 57:40.682
And your request is granted.

57:45.322 --> 57:47.842
You will fight tomorrow.

57:48.002 --> 57:49.482
- To the death.
- (MAN) Yes.

57:50.082 --> 57:52.322
Swords and shields.

57:53.282 --> 57:56.522
God shall determine the victor.

57:56.682 --> 57:58.682
(MAN) Fight to the death.
