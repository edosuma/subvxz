this year's legacy honoree,
I, kind of, took the liberty

10:38.986 --> 10:42.206
of signing up
to be the CCTC volunteer.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.515
I'm gonna be your liaison
for the entire event.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.691
If that's--if that's cool?
Like, if you're--

10:48.735 --> 10:50.780
like, if you're all right?
- Sounds great.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.477
- Cool 'cause I already have

10:52.521 --> 10:53.914
your whole itinerary planned
to sweet perfection.

10:56.046 --> 10:58.614
- So um, I'm late for work.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.704
So Ray, Chester, I'll pop
by the convention center later.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.401
See ya. I gotta go.
- Don't you dare.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.667
[groans]
- Ah, he forgot his breakfast.

11:08.537 --> 11:09.886
- And that's a bracelet.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.148
Uh, you know what?
I have to go, too.

11:11.192 --> 11:12.541
[laughs]
Deadlines.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.064
Uh, you got
the list of questions

11:14.108 --> 11:15.718
for the interview later, right?
- Sure do.

11:15.762 --> 11:16.980
See you at 4:00.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.377
- Heard some paroled ex-cons

11:22.420 --> 11:23.857
went shopping without
their wallets.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.120
- OG meta-criminals, actually.

11:26.163 --> 11:29.558
Jack, Ten, King, and the Queen,

11:29.601 --> 11:31.865
call themselves
the Royal Flush Gang.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.345
They were Central City's
very first meta-threat.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.390
- You work that case, too?

11:35.433 --> 11:36.957
- Actually, no.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.263
The first time
they pulled a job, I was...

11:43.790 --> 11:46.053
Kind of under the weather.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.663
It's weird. Their MO is

11:47.707 --> 11:51.319
stealing cash from casinos,
not microchips.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.235
- Well, at least no one
was killed.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.324
This time.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.674
- Everything okay, Captain?

12:01.546 --> 12:03.113
- This is the kind of case

12:03.157 --> 12:05.246
the meta-task force
would've been assigned to.

12:06.247 --> 12:10.512
- Um, so your mimic powers--

12:10.555 --> 12:12.819
how exactly do they work?

12:12.862 --> 12:15.343
- They only activate
in times of stress,

12:15.386 --> 12:18.259
when my adrenaline spikes,
and the effects are temporary.

12:19.173 --> 12:22.219
- That's good to--yeah.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.309
- Allen, does me being a meta

12:25.353 --> 12:27.311
make working for me
more difficult?

12:28.138 --> 12:29.792
- No, ma'am.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.925
It's already tough enough
as it is.

12:34.666 --> 12:37.234
I'll let you know
as soon as I find something.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.583
- Good.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.198
- [sighs]

12:44.241 --> 12:47.767
- So I've gone over everyone's
ideas, and they're great,

12:47.810 --> 12:49.246
but what I'd like to do
is start

12:49.290 --> 12:51.466
with last night's break-in
at Mercury Labs.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.598
[scoffs and groaning]

12:53.642 --> 12:56.384
- It's not news,
not in this city.

12:56.427 --> 12:59.648
- It's a high-tech theft
at a huge R&D corporation.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.563
- Which happens
all the time in this town.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.783
Was anyone killed...
- No.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.219
- Was the Flash involved...
- No, he isn't.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.611
- Tragedy sells papers, folks.
- But--

13:06.655 --> 13:08.744
- Sorry.
- That's not the point.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.050
- We should look into
the rumors of embezzlement

13:10.093 --> 13:11.660
inside the mayor's office.

13:11.703 --> 13:13.401
Scooping a major scandal
before our competition...

13:13.444 --> 13:15.055
- Will make Iris happy.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.447
Get in touch with someone
at the mayor's office.

13:16.491 --> 13:17.927
- I got 1,000 words to finish

13:17.971 --> 13:19.146
on the Sharks' new GM
for Iris, too.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.800
- Wait, what 1,000 words?

13:20.843 --> 13:22.758
- Well, I know the mayor's
executive assistant.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.107
We were in the same undergrad
sorority...

13:24.151 --> 13:25.761
- I need someone on this
Mercury break-in.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.284
- So she'll tell me everything.
- Uh, Vanya,

13:27.328 --> 13:29.199
I really need you to run
with this tech heist.

13:30.592 --> 13:33.160
- I'm gonna follow up on the
Calvert collision this morning.

13:33.203 --> 13:35.031
My source in
the county planner's office

13:35.075 --> 13:37.947
says it's gonna cost several
million to repair the damage.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.383
Talk about a budget crisis.

13:39.427 --> 13:42.430
Plus, that is what
Iris would want.

13:42.473 --> 13:47.174
- Iri--hold on.
Wait, you guys.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.653
Seriously?

13:51.656 --> 13:54.094
- We found this
at the train collision site.

13:54.137 --> 13:55.660
- I thought Kramer
had you working

13:55.704 --> 13:57.793
on the Mercury heist instead?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.795
- Uh, yeah. I am.
- You are,

13:59.839 --> 14:03.712
but you think that it's related
to the Calvert train collision?

14:03.755 --> 14:05.409
- I will know in a minute.

14:05.453 --> 14:08.195
While working evidence
from the Mercury Labs heist,

14:08.238 --> 14:10.937
I found charred marks
on the guard's weapons,

14:10.980 --> 14:13.374
marks exactly like those.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.898
Yeah, I was right.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.552
Heat signature's the same

14:17.595 --> 14:19.728
as the burn marks on
the weapons at Mercury Labs.

14:19.771 --> 14:23.123
Laser burns delivered
with pinpoint precision,

14:23.166 --> 14:24.689
Jack's trademarks.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.561
- Okay, okay.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.129
Even if it is
the Royal Flush Gang

14:29.172 --> 14:31.044
behind all of this, why?

14:31.087 --> 14:33.089
Why would they
go through all the trouble

14:33.133 --> 14:36.223
of causing
a massive railway collision

14:36.266 --> 14:38.486
when they haven't
even stolen anything yet?

14:38.529 --> 14:40.183
- I asked myself that, too.

14:40.227 --> 14:43.143
Then I found out what was
being carried in this case.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.841
A bleeding-edge beryllium core

14:45.885 --> 14:49.366
which is a highly unstable
power source.

14:49.410 --> 14:50.759
- And that's what caused
the trains to explode.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.935
- No.
A beryllium-based detonation

14:52.979 --> 14:55.285
would've leveled
a surrounding 10-mile radius.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.245
- [gasp]

14:58.288 --> 15:00.029
The core wasn't in the case
when the trains collided.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.553
- Which means,
the real question is,

15:02.597 --> 15:04.120
why is the Royal Flush Gang

15:04.164 --> 15:05.948
changing their MO
to become tech thieves?

15:05.992 --> 15:07.471

15:10.953 --> 15:12.824
Korber, what's going on?

15:12.868 --> 15:15.001
- Iron Heights just lost power
for three seconds,

15:15.044 --> 15:17.481
during which every cell door
unlocked and opened.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.136
Now they've got 1,000 inmates
roaming the facility.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.704

16:32.774 --> 16:34.994
You just got, like,

of the game for a little while.

Look, I know how
that might sound for the Atom,

you can handle it.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.857
