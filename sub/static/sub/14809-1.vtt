They were startled and frightened,
thinking they saw a ghost.

01:05.251 --> 01:07.060
He said to them, "Why are you troubled,
and why do doubts rise in your minds?"

01:07.084 --> 01:09.084
Look at my hands and my feet.
It is I myself!

01:09.167 --> 01:11.935
Touch me and see; a ghost does not have
flesh and bones, as you see I have.

But she's so young.

03:23.334 --> 03:24.334
You said it.

03:24.834 --> 03:28.292
- Don't go without eating.
- I gotta hurry.

03:28.334 --> 03:29.917
Just a bite!

03:29.959 --> 03:31.310
Hurrying won't bring back the dead.

05:30.084 --> 05:32.126
Let go of me!

05:32.209 --> 05:33.917
I'm his uncle!

05:39.042 --> 05:40.042
Jong-gu!

05:43.209 --> 05:46.917
Heung-guk, how could you do this?

05:54.834 --> 05:56.042
Sergeant.

06:00.251 --> 06:04.251
Did it with this, I guess.
Stabbed him, like, 20 times?

06:04.376 --> 06:05.667
Holy shit.

06:10.709 --> 06:11.792
What's that?

06:12.501 --> 06:16.459
Looks like the body was moved here
after the murder.

06:17.084 --> 06:18.334
What a mess.

06:19.167 --> 06:20.709
That's Cho-the husband?

06:21.209 --> 06:23.126
Looks that way.

06:24.501 --> 06:25.959
I'll be damned.

06:30.292 --> 06:31.584
And the kid?

06:31.626 --> 06:33.292
We took him to a relative

06:37.792 --> 06:38.792
Why'd he do it?

06:39.417 --> 06:41.709
I don't smell booze on
him, but he's not talking.

06:41.751 --> 06:46.501
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?

06:47.626 --> 06:50.292
What the hell happened?

06:50.334 --> 06:52.667
How's it going, Sergeant?

06:56.167 --> 06:59.876
I'm his uncle! Let go of me!

07:03.917 --> 07:05.959
Rotten bastard.

07:06.834 --> 07:11.876
Couldn't he use GPS? Why
do I have to take him?

07:13.417 --> 07:14.667
Ain't that it?

07:20.001 --> 07:22.084
Get the wire cutters.

07:26.376 --> 07:28.001
Pull it back.

07:32.959 --> 07:34.626
What's that stink?

07:36.542 --> 07:39.542
So. Cho was killed here.

07:40.917 --> 07:42.834
What the fuck is all this?

07:45.459 --> 07:48.751
So he invited Cho over, killed him,

07:48.792 --> 07:53.126
put the body in a sack, dragged it to
his house, and then killed his wife?

07:53.209 --> 07:55.001
Crime of passion.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.876
Make sure you photograph everything.

08:00.126 --> 08:03.292
Here, there, that stuff over there.

08:37.292 --> 08:38.292
Jong-gu!

08:38.876 --> 08:40.542
Get over here!

08:40.583 --> 08:42.626
Sergeant, come over here.

08:45.834 --> 08:46.959
Shit!

08:47.126 --> 08:48.417
Oh god...

08:51.626 --> 08:53.126
That cocksucker.

08:55.251 --> 08:57.751
What kind of twisted freak is he?

09:18.167 --> 09:23.542
<THE WAILING GOKSUNG>

12:12.417 --> 12:14.167
Is that scary, or what?

12:20.167 --> 12:22.084
Scary, my ass.

12:23.751 --> 12:27.209
Anyway, the whole town's talking about it.

12:27.251 --> 12:31.084
Who told you that story?

12:31.126 --> 12:32.334
Byeong-gyu.

12:32.459 --> 12:35.251
That goddamned bastard...

12:36.001 --> 12:38.751
Now he's spreading those
stories to you, too?

12:40.959 --> 12:44.001
Well, from what I hear,

12:44.584 --> 12:46.464
there's definitely something
off with that guy.

12:46.917 --> 12:48.376
Like what?

12:48.417 --> 12:50.876
The corner store owner went crazy,

12:50.917 --> 12:52.751
The guy at the mill dropped dead,

12:53.459 --> 12:55.501
and then Heung-gu turns
up dead two days ago.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.542
So?

12:57.042 --> 13:00.376
All this happened after
that Japanese man arrived.

13:05.751 --> 13:12.292
Quit talking out of your
ass, you ignorant dope.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.167
Who're you calling ignorant?

13:15.292 --> 13:19.876
Look, the test results on Heung-guk
came back today.

13:19.959 --> 13:23.751
Apparently, he ate some
fucked-up mushrooms.

13:23.792 --> 13:24.709
What?

13:24.751 --> 13:27.792
You know. The ones with the drugs
that make you go crazy.

13:27.834 --> 13:30.584
His blood was full of that shit.

13:31.042 --> 13:33.792
And there were tons
of dried mushrooms at his place.

13:34.542 --> 13:36.501
You really believe that?

13:36.542 --> 13:38.334
It's what the results said!

13:38.376 --> 13:40.334
Didn't you ever try those
mushrooms as a kid?

13:40.376 --> 13:41.584
Hell no.

13:41.626 --> 13:44.376
All I know is, mushrooms
don't do that to you.

13:44.417 --> 13:46.417
You saw that poor guy.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.876
Mushrooms would never make you that way.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.459
But I'm right about the Japanese guy.

13:58.042 --> 14:00.334
If everyone's talking about him,

14:00.376 --> 14:03.167
there's likely a good reason.

14:10.209 --> 14:11.376
What the hell?

14:11.584 --> 14:14.584
Power's gone out again.

14:15.209 --> 14:16.917
Fuck.

14:16.959 --> 14:22.501
I keep telling the Captain
to get that damn wiring fixed.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.417
Never listens!

14:27.501 --> 14:28.917
What the fuck!

14:29.001 --> 14:32.209
- What's wrong?
- What the Christ was that?

14:32.251 --> 14:33.834
- That thing outside.
- What's outside?

14:33.876 --> 14:36.542
- Outside, that... fuck!
- What's your problem?

14:38.834 --> 14:40.959
What is it, man?

14:41.459 --> 14:42.834
You check it out.

14:43.001 --> 14:44.792
- Me?
- Yes, you! Dammit.

14:44.834 --> 14:46.334
You want me to go out?

14:46.376 --> 14:49.084
I'm telling you, asshole,
to get your ass out there!

14:49.126 --> 14:51.167
For crying out loud...

14:51.209 --> 14:52.251
Okay, I'll go.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.126
Come on, hurry!

14:54.542 --> 14:55.626
Shit.

14:56.709 --> 14:59.501
Who the fuck are you? What the hell?

15:16.167 --> 15:18.501
Stop, goddamn it!

15:20.501 --> 15:23.417
Stop it, you dirty slut! You whore!

15:38.792 --> 15:39.917
Eat this, too.

16:11.251 --> 16:13.251
Man, you're heavy.

16:18.501 --> 16:20.626
I'm getting too old for this.

16:20.834 --> 16:22.126
Don't be ridiculous.

16:23.584 --> 16:27.834
Old ladies tell me men can
still get it up after 70.

16:29.334 --> 16:34.709
Then buy me some herbal supplements.

16:36.042 --> 16:38.334
I keep having fucked-up nightmares.

16:38.376 --> 16:39.584
What're you doing in there?

16:39.626 --> 16:40.959
Oh hell. Shit!

16:41.001 --> 16:43.917
Nothing! Get away from the car.

16:43.959 --> 16:47.084
- Don't open it!
- What are you doing?

16:47.126 --> 16:48.417
For crying out loud!

16:56.251 --> 16:57.334
Dad!

16:59.626 --> 17:01.001
Dad?

17:04.916 --> 17:05.959
Look.

17:09.584 --> 17:10.709
How do I look?

17:11.709 --> 17:13.209
Pretty.

17:14.584 --> 17:16.416
Freakishly pretty.

17:42.501 --> 17:43.834
How long were you watching?

17:50.001 --> 17:51.584
How much did you see?

17:52.876 --> 17:54.959
Don't worry, I won't tell.

17:58.709 --> 18:01.001
So you saw everything.

18:02.292 --> 18:05.001
No big deal. It's not the first time.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.126
What?

18:17.959 --> 18:18.834
Here.

18:18.876 --> 18:20.167
What?

18:21.167 --> 18:24.001
It's okay. Have a sip.

18:49.417 --> 18:51.209
Hurry up!

18:58.917 --> 19:00.542
Son of a bitch!

19:02.042 --> 19:04.876
What took you so long? Ignoring my calls?

19:04.917 --> 19:08.542
My mother-in-law got sick.

19:08.584 --> 19:10.435
Now you're using your
mother-in-law as an excuse?

19:10.459 --> 19:11.834
You were taking a nap, I can tell!

19:11.876 --> 19:14.834
No, I wasn't. I swear.

19:18.751 --> 19:21.792
Get to work.

19:25.917 --> 19:28.334
Excuse me, ma'am?

19:32.584 --> 19:33.959
What the hell?

19:38.042 --> 19:40.667
What are you doing? Stop her.

19:40.709 --> 19:42.126
Yes, sir.

19:43.126 --> 19:44.584
Come with me, ma'am.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.584
Get off me!

19:48.667 --> 19:51.792
Sergeant, get her out of here.

19:52.542 --> 19:55.042
Back off, people.

19:57.376 --> 19:59.542
What's wrong with her?

20:37.626 --> 20:39.209
Please, calm down.

20:42.667 --> 20:44.084
That idiot...

20:56.251 --> 20:58.334
Calm down, ma'am.

21:10.709 --> 21:11.709
Jong-gu.

21:12.459 --> 21:13.959
Get cleaned up, man.

21:14.626 --> 21:17.501
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

21:17.542 --> 21:18.667
It's not your fault...

21:19.209 --> 21:22.667
that you're a little girly-man
with balls the size of peas.

21:23.126 --> 21:24.834
Oh jeez.

21:24.876 --> 21:26.126
Hello!

21:26.167 --> 21:27.542
- Hey.
- Hi, Hyo-jin.

21:27.584 --> 21:28.709
Hello, Captain.

21:28.751 --> 21:30.792
- How are you?
- Good.

21:30.834 --> 21:33.251
- You've got clean clothes for Daddy?
- Yeah.

21:39.876 --> 21:42.792
Mom got you clean boxers and an undershirt.

21:43.959 --> 21:45.501
Thanks, darling.

21:46.292 --> 21:47.584
Take a shower.

21:47.959 --> 21:50.334
I will. Go home.

21:52.792 --> 21:56.459
You didn't even eat, did you?

21:56.501 --> 22:02.542
All right, get out of here.
Can't you see Daddy's working?

22:10.959 --> 22:13.376
See you.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.084
Goodbye, officers.

22:17.209 --> 22:18.501
- Bye.
- See ya.

22:18.542 --> 22:20.126
- Take care, sweetie.
- Oh, my.

22:30.209 --> 22:32.667
That scatterbrain.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.001
Seong-bok?

22:43.042 --> 22:44.084
Yeah.

22:44.584 --> 22:45.917
It just hit me.

22:46.459 --> 22:47.709
What?

22:48.542 --> 22:49.834
That woman...

22:50.501 --> 22:51.584
What woman?

22:51.626 --> 22:53.542
The one whose house burned down...

22:54.334 --> 22:56.584
I knew I'd seen her before.

22:56.626 --> 22:59.626
It's that naked woman from last night.

23:00.542 --> 23:01.167
What?

23:01.209 --> 23:06.126
The woman who was standing here last night.

23:12.751 --> 23:14.626
Crazy fools.

23:56.876 --> 24:00.501
They didn't burn to death.
They were stabbed.

24:00.542 --> 24:01.584
All three of them?

24:01.626 --> 24:02.792
Yeah.

24:04.251 --> 24:06.251
Freaked the hell out of me, too.

24:08.334 --> 24:13.334
Prime suspect is the
missus who hung herself.

24:16.917 --> 24:20.959
What the heck happened?

24:22.417 --> 24:24.084
Beats me.

24:25.334 --> 24:26.334
Over here.

24:28.001 --> 24:28.959
In here.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.001
What?

24:30.126 --> 24:33.084
Give us a hand.

24:34.626 --> 24:35.751
A little more.

24:41.417 --> 24:42.459
Found it.

24:44.084 --> 24:46.792
Idiot! Don't touch it with your bare hands!

24:49.209 --> 24:50.626
What the...?

24:50.667 --> 24:53.167
Are you a moron?

24:54.292 --> 24:55.584
That's evidence.

24:56.209 --> 25:00.501
He should've wrapped it in cloth
or something, right?

25:01.209 --> 25:04.251
Gokseong Police Station

25:19.042 --> 25:22.417
So, she killed everyone?

25:22.917 --> 25:24.167
That's what they said.

25:26.376 --> 25:28.917
I'll be damned.

25:29.292 --> 25:31.251
So, that's what happened.

25:31.292 --> 25:33.876
Why did you call me?
Things are crazy at work.

25:34.417 --> 25:36.417
Because of this case.

25:39.459 --> 25:42.834
Remember what I told you before?

25:42.917 --> 25:44.042
What?

25:44.084 --> 25:47.417
How the Jap raped a woman?

25:47.751 --> 25:49.542
What about it?

26:01.376 --> 26:04.167
You filthy slut.

26:08.417 --> 26:09.792
That woman.

26:11.042 --> 26:12.334
It was her.

26:13.084 --> 26:14.876
What the hell are you talking about?

26:14.917 --> 26:17.376
That woman he raped-

26:17.417 --> 26:19.709
it's the same woman whose
house burned down.

26:25.959 --> 26:29.334
She went crazy after that,

26:29.376 --> 26:32.501
and used to run around naked at night.

26:33.626 --> 26:36.542
My wife saw her at the public bathhouse.

26:37.042 --> 26:40.792
She was totally covered
in rashes and boils,

26:40.834 --> 26:45.584
Mumbling gibberish the whole time.

26:49.542 --> 26:51.334
Are you out of your mind?

26:52.376 --> 26:54.584
Byeong-gyu's got to stop this.

26:55.334 --> 26:57.876
Talking crap to his dimwitted buddies.

26:57.917 --> 27:02.251
You worthless bastard. It was your theory.

27:02.292 --> 27:04.834
I was just messing with you.

27:05.417 --> 27:09.167
Who in their right mind
would believe crap like that?

27:09.251 --> 27:13.376
No, I think you're right.

27:14.001 --> 27:16.626
It can't be the mushrooms.
That doesn't make sense.

27:16.667 --> 27:18.542
Gimme a break.

27:23.417 --> 27:25.167
What are you looking at?

27:32.667 --> 27:33.876
Get outta here!

27:37.084 --> 27:38.126
What?

27:39.167 --> 27:42.001
Ignore her. She's been
doing that all morning.

27:43.042 --> 27:44.501
What a nutjob.

27:46.167 --> 27:50.751
So, how about you check
with the local dermatologist.

27:50.792 --> 27:54.959
See if there's any medical records
on Heung-guk or that woman.

27:56.667 --> 27:58.042
Stop it, you tramp!

27:58.667 --> 28:00.626
I can't believe this.

28:00.667 --> 28:03.251
It's important, you idiot!

28:03.626 --> 28:08.542
The rash is the link here.

28:11.292 --> 28:13.042
Come on, hurry.

28:24.292 --> 28:26.792
Stop it! You could hurt somebody!

28:27.001 --> 28:29.917
Community Health Center

28:33.001 --> 28:34.417
Oh, my.

28:48.626 --> 28:52.376
You're really getting on my nerves!

28:57.667 --> 28:58.959
Where do you live?

29:01.084 --> 29:02.709
Are you from this village?

29:12.001 --> 29:13.126
Hey.

29:14.542 --> 29:15.792
Don't come near me!

29:19.292 --> 29:20.501
Dammit!

29:27.459 --> 29:29.459
The lady killed them all.

29:30.001 --> 29:31.251
What?

29:31.292 --> 29:35.167
In there. In that room.

29:40.292 --> 29:41.584
What are you talking about?

29:42.376 --> 29:47.292
The old woman got a
shaman to do some ritual,

29:48.376 --> 29:50.542
but the lady refused.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.584
That's why they all got killed.

29:57.167 --> 29:58.542
Are you a family member?

30:00.917 --> 30:02.084
No, I'm not.

30:02.792 --> 30:04.042
Then who are you?

30:05.417 --> 30:06.459
Come with me.

30:06.626 --> 30:07.876
Hey!

30:09.542 --> 30:10.751
What the...?

30:14.459 --> 30:15.959
You can't go in there.

30:16.709 --> 30:18.126
It's all right.

30:19.542 --> 30:20.542
Hey...

30:25.459 --> 30:26.542
Come on.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.459
She killed them here.

30:39.959 --> 30:42.084
The old woman got it the worst of it.

30:42.917 --> 30:47.001
Her head was smashed
open like a watermelon.

30:49.209 --> 30:50.709
You saw with your own eyes?

30:52.542 --> 30:55.292
Of course I did.

30:55.876 --> 30:56.917
How?

30:59.834 --> 31:02.292
The old woman tells me

31:02.334 --> 31:04.042
the Jap is a ghost.

31:05.376 --> 31:09.417
He was gonna suck her blood dry.

31:14.251 --> 31:15.084
The Jap?

31:15.126 --> 31:16.459
Yeah.

31:16.501 --> 31:18.126
The Jap with the limp.

31:19.501 --> 31:20.917
Oh, him!

31:22.376 --> 31:23.792
You've seen him?

31:24.292 --> 31:25.417
Yeah.

31:25.459 --> 31:26.667
How many times?

31:27.126 --> 31:29.167
Once or twice.

31:29.209 --> 31:30.417
Be careful.

31:30.459 --> 31:31.751
Why?

31:32.167 --> 31:36.917
The old woman says, if you
keep seeing him around,

31:37.209 --> 31:40.209
it's because he's stalking you.

31:41.501 --> 31:43.417
To suck your blood dry.

31:51.501 --> 31:53.334
Wait here for a second.

31:54.001 --> 31:55.251
Okay.

32:00.167 --> 32:01.792
Get your ass over here.

32:01.834 --> 32:03.042
What?

32:03.084 --> 32:04.667
Get over here now!

32:06.251 --> 32:08.417
But I just found the dermatologist.

32:08.459 --> 32:10.584
I found a witness.

32:11.084 --> 32:13.834
So, get over here as fast as you can.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.876
What the...?

32:27.917 --> 32:29.209
Where'd she go?

33:27.667 --> 33:31.292
What terrible sin did you commit,
to be yelling like that?

33:32.626 --> 33:34.084
Are you feeling sick?

33:35.876 --> 33:38.542
Keep having weird dreams.

33:41.792 --> 33:43.209
Who's the medicine for?

33:43.251 --> 33:46.084
Hyo-jin's not feeling well.
She couldn't go to school.

33:52.792 --> 33:55.751
She's burning up.

33:58.209 --> 34:01.584
And where were you while she was so sick?

34:01.626 --> 34:02.959
I was getting her medicine.

34:03.001 --> 34:05.876
What's with you? Take her to the hospital.

34:19.917 --> 34:21.583
What on earth was that?

34:28.001 --> 34:29.876
Turn off the hose first.

34:29.917 --> 34:31.626
Moron...

34:33.542 --> 34:37.667
Just coming into work now, are you?

34:37.708 --> 34:41.626
Hyo-jin wasn't feeling well.

34:42.376 --> 34:45.001
So now you're blaming your daughter?

34:45.042 --> 34:46.333
I'm not making it up.

34:46.376 --> 34:47.792
Did you find your witness?

34:48.458 --> 34:49.458
No, sir.

34:49.501 --> 34:51.333
After turning the whole town upside down.

34:51.376 --> 34:53.751
You think this case is going
to be your big break?

34:53.876 --> 34:57.459
Seong-bok's been calling around.

34:58.792 --> 35:01.001
That's your excuse?

35:01.042 --> 35:05.084
Look at him. He can't even wash the car.

35:05.584 --> 35:07.042
Driving me up the wall.

35:07.084 --> 35:10.167
Even the Chief heard about your witness.

35:10.792 --> 35:14.334
Whether you lied, or let her get away-

35:15.292 --> 35:16.876
you're screwed.

35:17.876 --> 35:19.167
Yes, sir.

35:21.751 --> 35:25.751
This is driving me up the wall.

35:25.792 --> 35:29.126
Don't pay any attention
to the crazy girl's talk.

35:32.126 --> 35:35.334
Not her. I'm talking about this.

35:38.251 --> 35:39.959
Family Tragedy Linked To Wild Mushrooms

35:40.001 --> 35:42.001
"Murdered by... wild mushrooms"?

35:43.126 --> 35:45.376
What did the dermatologist say? Mushrooms?

35:46.376 --> 35:50.126
He wasn't sure,
so he referred Heung-guk to the hospital.

35:50.167 --> 35:53.626
Told you. It can't be the mushrooms.

35:54.751 --> 35:56.001
It's not impossible.

35:56.834 --> 35:58.209
Shut your hole.

36:02.792 --> 36:06.459
You know that story Byeong-gyu told you?

36:07.084 --> 36:08.626
There are so many.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.834
The one about the naked man
eating the deer carcass.

36:11.876 --> 36:13.501
What's gotten into you?

36:14.084 --> 36:16.376
At a crazy time like this?

36:16.417 --> 36:18.667
It's because things are so crazy.

36:20.501 --> 36:23.001
You know the guy who saw it, right?

36:27.209 --> 36:28.709
"Herbs & Tonics"

36:28.751 --> 36:29.917
Over here.

36:33.167 --> 36:35.001
You may not believe it,

36:36.001 --> 36:38.834
but I saw it with my own eyes.

36:40.292 --> 36:41.751
Look at this.

36:41.876 --> 36:43.084
Can you see it?

36:44.417 --> 36:45.876
Sure.

36:46.292 --> 36:48.751
I got 22 stitches.

36:49.667 --> 36:53.001
From falling on your head
while you were drunk?

36:53.626 --> 36:55.876
What are you talking about?

36:55.917 --> 36:59.376
I'm too old to make shit up.

37:00.126 --> 37:01.626
You got proof?

37:01.667 --> 37:02.834
Proof?

37:02.876 --> 37:04.501
Hell yes, proof!

37:04.876 --> 37:08.001
I'm not the kind to talk
shit without backing it up.

37:11.376 --> 37:13.292
Come look at this.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.959
You ready?

37:16.959 --> 37:17.959
Look.

37:21.626 --> 37:23.042
You see?

37:23.084 --> 37:24.334
Empty, right?

37:24.917 --> 37:28.501
I stayed the hell away from
the mountains since that day.

37:29.251 --> 37:31.876
Even put the store up for sale.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.501
How is that proof?

37:35.167 --> 37:36.251
What?

37:37.292 --> 37:39.126
Damn you...

37:39.709 --> 37:41.417
That's not the point.

37:42.376 --> 37:44.917
The point is, when I opened my eyes,

37:45.751 --> 37:50.334
there he was-stark naked
except for a diaper.

37:50.376 --> 37:51.334
A diaper?

37:51.376 --> 37:52.626
That's right.

37:52.667 --> 37:53.542
A grown man?

37:53.584 --> 37:54.542
I'm telling you.

37:54.584 --> 37:57.376
- Grown men can wear diapers.
- Get outta here.

37:57.417 --> 38:00.376
Bladder control problems
are surprisingly common in adults.

38:00.417 --> 38:03.459
But why go into the woods
to treat incontinence?

38:03.709 --> 38:07.917
- Incontinence...
- Am I talking to myself here?

38:09.459 --> 38:10.834
Anyway,

38:10.876 --> 38:13.667
he had his face buried in the carcass,

38:13.709 --> 38:16.501
his body covered in blood...

38:16.542 --> 38:18.709
his eyes all bloodshot.

38:18.751 --> 38:22.459
Then he looked up,

38:23.459 --> 38:25.584
and all of a sudden...

38:29.751 --> 38:32.876
I haven't slept since that day.

38:33.292 --> 38:36.584
- He was chewing on the guts?
- That's right.

38:36.792 --> 38:40.417
- You saw him eating raw flesh?
- Yeah...

38:40.459 --> 38:43.292
Wait, look here.

38:44.251 --> 38:46.834
See where the skin's broken?

38:48.584 --> 38:51.584
Bastard even bit me.

38:51.792 --> 38:53.667
Where does the guy live?

38:53.834 --> 38:55.042
Why, you gonna go there?

38:55.084 --> 38:56.376
I think I should.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.417
Don't. You'll regret it.

39:00.126 --> 39:02.417
It's just a suspicion, but...

39:03.376 --> 39:06.917
You know how the villagers have been
dying out recently?

39:06.959 --> 39:09.126
He's got something to do with it.

39:10.751 --> 39:12.417
He's not human.

39:13.834 --> 39:15.834
Give me his address.

39:15.876 --> 39:17.876
It's out in the middle of nowhere.

39:17.917 --> 39:20.334
You've gotta have a general idea.

39:20.376 --> 39:23.334
It's hard to explain in words.

39:23.376 --> 39:25.751
It's deep in the valley somewhere.

39:50.126 --> 39:51.459
How much further is it?

39:52.376 --> 39:53.834
Still a ways ahead.

40:24.959 --> 40:25.959
Shit!

40:32.959 --> 40:34.084
What's the matter?

40:35.542 --> 40:36.584
It's there.

40:37.459 --> 40:39.042
Over there.

40:39.084 --> 40:40.292
I don't see a house.

40:40.792 --> 40:42.042
Look.

40:42.917 --> 40:44.084
Right over there.

40:46.459 --> 40:47.751
Whoa, isn't that a deer?

40:49.667 --> 40:51.084
So, you weren't making this up.

40:52.292 --> 40:55.417
What did I tell you, dammit?

40:57.792 --> 40:59.417
What in God's name...

40:59.459 --> 41:00.876
What's happening?

41:04.334 --> 41:05.626
Look.

41:05.667 --> 41:06.917
You know...

41:09.417 --> 41:10.959
What's going on?

41:14.501 --> 41:16.126
That should do it, right?

41:16.417 --> 41:19.417
What? You gotta show us the house.

41:19.459 --> 41:22.084
It's just over that hill.

41:22.126 --> 41:23.959
It's just the one house.

41:24.001 --> 41:25.167
You can't miss it.

41:25.709 --> 41:29.417
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.

41:29.459 --> 41:31.376
Don't touch me, I gotta go!

41:31.417 --> 41:34.667
Where do you think you're going?

41:34.709 --> 41:36.334
I said let go!

41:42.126 --> 41:43.334
Shit...

41:46.959 --> 41:48.209
Hey!

41:48.542 --> 41:49.876
Mister.

41:49.917 --> 41:51.084
Mister?

41:53.334 --> 41:54.251
Mister?

41:54.292 --> 41:55.667
You all right?

42:00.001 --> 42:01.792
You fucking bastards.

42:03.334 --> 42:04.876
We're sorry.

42:04.917 --> 42:06.751
Fuck off.

42:07.792 --> 42:13.334
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.

42:14.042 --> 42:15.834
We're real sorry, okay?

42:15.959 --> 42:17.251
Fuck you.

42:18.042 --> 42:20.667
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.

42:45.251 --> 42:46.501
Where are you going?

42:47.709 --> 42:49.251
You got hit by lightning.

42:49.876 --> 42:51.417
Hey!

43:06.126 --> 43:07.542
What's the point of taking

43:07.584 --> 43:09.542
all those health tonics-

43:12.209 --> 43:14.667
if it's lightning that kills you?

43:18.417 --> 43:22.084
How can something like this happen?

43:26.001 --> 43:29.709
What are the chances?

43:32.334 --> 43:37.501
But they'll say, thanks
to all those tonics,

43:38.167 --> 43:39.792
he survived.

43:44.126 --> 43:46.126
Nurse! Nurse!

43:46.167 --> 43:48.001
It's Park Heung-guk in 302!

43:48.042 --> 43:50.667
You gotta come now. It's Park Heung-guk!

43:57.584 --> 43:59.126
It's an emergency!

44:13.167 --> 44:14.251
Doctor!

44:32.459 --> 44:33.501
What's going on?

45:25.959 --> 45:27.626
Can anybody make sense

45:29.626 --> 45:31.542
of what's happening here?

45:41.001 --> 45:43.334
Let's go back to the Jap's house tomorrow.

45:48.417 --> 45:51.417
There's definitely
something going on there.

46:29.334 --> 46:30.376
Hyo-jin?

46:32.084 --> 46:33.167
Hyo-jin.

46:35.001 --> 46:36.084
Baby!

46:36.292 --> 46:37.209
Daddy's right here.

46:37.251 --> 46:39.251
Daddy's right here, sweetie.

46:39.292 --> 46:41.584
Look at Daddy.

46:42.001 --> 46:43.251
Look at Daddy.

46:43.292 --> 46:44.459
Hyo-jin!

46:44.501 --> 46:46.251
Look at me.

46:46.709 --> 46:47.751
Hyo-jin!

46:48.251 --> 46:49.376
Look at me.

46:50.084 --> 46:51.292
Look at Daddy.

46:53.167 --> 46:54.084
Daddy's here.

46:54.126 --> 46:55.792
Dad...

47:00.584 --> 47:05.417
- I'm right here.
- Do something, Daddy!

47:06.542 --> 47:09.167
What, sweetie?

47:09.876 --> 47:13.667
Someone keeps banging on the door,

47:13.709 --> 47:16.667
trying to get in.

47:17.584 --> 47:18.792
Who?

47:19.209 --> 47:23.709
A strange man. He's trying to get in.

47:29.209 --> 47:30.959
It's okay, it's okay...

47:52.959 --> 47:54.084
Hyo-jin.

47:59.334 --> 48:00.334
Hyo-jin?

48:04.501 --> 48:05.667
What is this?

48:08.626 --> 48:09.876
You're all right?

48:12.251 --> 48:13.959
Morning, Dad.

48:23.459 --> 48:26.834
But she never eats fish...

48:26.876 --> 48:28.459
Something's wrong with her.

48:29.459 --> 48:33.084
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.

48:34.417 --> 48:38.751
I asked the old lady next door
to recommend a good shaman.

48:39.209 --> 48:42.167
I'm gonna consult with
him, just so you know.

48:43.084 --> 48:44.209
Got that?

48:48.292 --> 48:50.417
Okay.

48:51.126 --> 48:52.376
Good.

49:14.001 --> 49:15.876
Hey.

49:17.917 --> 49:19.042
Say hello.

49:19.084 --> 49:20.251
This is my nephew.

49:24.792 --> 49:25.876
What, a priest?

49:25.917 --> 49:29.626
Not yet, he's in training. A deacon.

49:31.001 --> 49:34.459
We'll need a translator to talk to the man.

49:38.417 --> 49:39.792
You speak Japanese?

49:40.417 --> 49:41.751
Just a little.

49:41.792 --> 49:44.167
He lived in Japan when he was young.

49:44.209 --> 49:45.792
What's that on your neck?

49:45.834 --> 49:46.917
Nothing.

49:47.501 --> 49:50.001
You've gotta be kidding me.

49:51.917 --> 49:53.542
What's your name, son?

49:53.584 --> 49:55.667
Yang E-sam. Two-three

49:56.751 --> 49:58.084
Is that your real name?

49:58.167 --> 49:59.292
Yes, sir.

49:59.751 --> 50:00.584
Let's go.

50:00.626 --> 50:01.834
Get in.

50:40.626 --> 50:43.667
Anybody home?

51:02.251 --> 51:03.292
What is it?

51:25.084 --> 51:27.001
Goddamn perv.

51:33.917 --> 51:35.917
Look at this. What does it say?

51:38.292 --> 51:40.876
Uncle, this is illegal.

51:41.417 --> 51:42.209
I know.

51:42.251 --> 51:45.084
Then why... We should stop.

51:45.167 --> 51:46.435
If you won't help, wait outside.

51:46.459 --> 51:47.126
But Uncle!

51:47.167 --> 51:48.709
Okay, you wait outside.

52:04.042 --> 52:06.417
What are you staring at?

52:09.126 --> 52:10.834
Go keep a lookout.

52:54.792 --> 52:56.334
What the fuck?

53:35.501 --> 53:38.501
- Son of a bitch!
- Get over here!

53:38.542 --> 53:40.459
Get him off me!

54:10.292 --> 54:12.959
What were you doing poking
around the doghouse?

54:35.126 --> 54:37.334
Block the door!

54:37.542 --> 54:39.542
Get over here!

54:41.584 --> 54:43.167
Shit!

54:43.292 --> 54:45.209
Seong-bok, you bastard!

54:47.626 --> 54:49.459
Fucking bastard!

54:53.084 --> 54:54.126
Where is it?

54:54.751 --> 54:55.751
Where did it go?

54:56.667 --> 54:57.709
Over there.

55:03.167 --> 55:04.292
Seong-bok.

55:05.417 --> 55:06.959
I think it's the owner.

55:15.167 --> 55:16.292
Seong-bok?

56:22.251 --> 56:23.626
Excuse me.

56:38.376 --> 56:39.501
Are you all right?

56:39.667 --> 56:40.667
Yeah.

56:41.751 --> 56:43.459
What's the matter with you?

56:43.501 --> 56:44.584
Did you get bit?

56:45.084 --> 56:46.084
Huh?

56:49.292 --> 56:51.626
Say something, dammit.

56:52.667 --> 56:54.126
He's the criminal.

56:55.501 --> 56:56.959
You're scaring me, man.

56:58.459 --> 56:59.584
Snap out of it.

57:00.584 --> 57:02.751
It wasn't just one or two people.

57:03.084 --> 57:05.292
He took pictures of them
when they were alive-

57:05.917 --> 57:10.334
and then went back for more
when they went crazy and died.

57:10.376 --> 57:13.126
What the hell are you going on about?

57:15.501 --> 57:16.876
He's the criminal.

57:16.917 --> 57:20.292
That's enough. I'll deal with you later.

57:20.334 --> 57:21.584
I'm sure of it.

57:22.792 --> 57:24.209
He...

57:26.292 --> 57:28.417
He took his victims' belongings

57:30.292 --> 57:32.167
and did something with them.

57:35.417 --> 57:37.126
What did you see?

57:41.501 --> 57:43.167
Tell me!

57:48.126 --> 57:50.959
Jeon Hyo-jin

57:59.709 --> 58:01.459
You're getting all wet!

58:01.501 --> 58:02.501
Where is Hyo-jin?

58:02.542 --> 58:03.792
In the living room.

58:11.459 --> 58:12.584
Hyo-jin.

58:15.834 --> 58:17.501
You're home early.

58:17.542 --> 58:19.209
Did you lose your trainer?

58:20.001 --> 58:22.292
No, why?

58:31.834 --> 58:33.126
What's this, then?

58:35.001 --> 58:36.209
It's not mine.

58:36.626 --> 58:38.126
Isn't this your handwriting?

58:38.959 --> 58:40.584
I said, it's not mine.

58:45.126 --> 58:49.334
You know anything about
a Japanese man living in the village?

58:53.542 --> 58:56.084
You're dripping water all over the place.

58:56.126 --> 58:59.209
Answer me. Do you know him or not?

59:03.626 --> 59:05.334
Did you meet him?

59:08.834 --> 59:10.167
Answer me.

59:11.209 --> 59:13.084
You're scaring her.

59:13.126 --> 59:14.459
Get out for a sec.

59:15.876 --> 59:18.709
Come on, this is serious. It's you and me.

59:26.459 --> 59:29.626
Daddy is a policeman. I'll know if you lie.

59:31.626 --> 59:33.459
Did you meet this man?

59:40.459 --> 59:41.542
Tell me.

59:43.917 --> 59:45.001
Tell you what?

59:45.042 --> 59:46.459
Everything.

59:46.501 --> 59:48.876
Where you met, what you did.

59:50.084 --> 59:51.709
Why should I tell you?

59:51.751 --> 59:53.251
Because it's important.

59:53.334 --> 59:54.876
What's so important?

59:55.917 --> 59:57.084
Answer me, girl!

01:00:01.001 --> 01:00:02.792
I said, what's so important?

01:00:05.751 --> 01:00:09.584
What's so damn important?

01:00:10.251 --> 01:00:12.001
What the hell...

01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:14.251
is so damned important?

01:00:18.167 --> 01:00:20.501
You don't even know what's important.

01:00:21.126 --> 01:00:23.751
Stop grilling me, goddamn it!

01:01:09.167 --> 01:01:11.459
Fuck!

01:02:02.167 --> 01:02:03.751
What are you doing?

01:02:06.126 --> 01:02:09.042
I thought you were sleeping.

01:02:09.084 --> 01:02:10.292
What the hell?

01:02:14.501 --> 01:02:17.834
Yanking up your daughter's skirt
in the middle of the night?

01:02:25.501 --> 01:02:26.917
Speak, will you?

01:02:29.751 --> 01:02:32.292
Tell me, asshole!

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:36.876
Tell me, you fucking shithead!

01:02:37.251 --> 01:02:38.792
Fuck you!

01:02:43.792 --> 01:02:46.209
Stop staring, motherfucker!

01:02:46.251 --> 01:02:48.501
Don't call your daddy that!

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.834
Don't you look at me!

01:02:53.167 --> 01:02:56.084
Stop it! Daddy said he was sorry.

01:02:56.167 --> 01:02:58.292
I'm gonna kill all of you.

01:02:59.417 --> 01:03:00.626
How could you?

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:19.042
I met the shaman today.

01:03:20.667 --> 01:03:22.626
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.

01:03:23.417 --> 01:03:25.751
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.

01:03:27.251 --> 01:03:29.792
And if we don't act,
there'll be dead bodies.

01:03:30.834 --> 01:03:32.917
He's supposed to be the best.

01:03:46.001 --> 01:03:47.834
Why didn't you answer my calls?

01:03:49.751 --> 01:03:52.459
Come with me, and don't give me any crap.

01:05:07.501 --> 01:05:09.461
Ask him where he stashed
the stuff from in there.

01:05:10.417 --> 01:05:14.084
The things in there... where are they now?

01:05:19.542 --> 01:05:20.834
What things?

01:05:22.042 --> 01:05:23.376
He asks what things.

01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:25.792
The stuff we saw before.

01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:29.792
Things we saw... before.

01:05:29.834 --> 01:05:31.126
The photographs?

01:05:31.917 --> 01:05:32.917
You mean the pictures?

01:05:32.959 --> 01:05:34.792
Yeah, the pictures. And the other stuff.

01:05:35.042 --> 01:05:36.042
Yes.

01:05:40.084 --> 01:05:41.459
I burned them.

01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:42.584
Sorry?

01:05:44.751 --> 01:05:46.251
I burned them.

01:05:48.876 --> 01:05:50.667
He burned them.

01:05:52.792 --> 01:05:53.876
Where?

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.626
Where?

01:05:58.459 --> 01:06:01.250
In the kitchen.

01:06:18.292 --> 01:06:19.792
Bastard!

01:06:22.209 --> 01:06:23.251
You!

01:06:25.584 --> 01:06:27.292
What did you come here to do?

01:06:30.126 --> 01:06:32.834
What did you come here to do?

01:06:36.167 --> 01:06:37.542
Ask him again.

01:06:39.792 --> 01:06:42.417
What did you come here to do?

01:06:48.334 --> 01:06:49.459
To travel.

01:06:50.501 --> 01:06:51.959
To travel, he says.

01:06:52.667 --> 01:06:56.334
Tell him I'll throw him in jail
if he doesn't fess up.

01:06:59.292 --> 01:07:01.667
Tell us the truth.

01:07:09.667 --> 01:07:10.584
Even if I told you,

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:12.251
you wouldn't believe me.

01:07:12.501 --> 01:07:16.001
He says you wouldn't believe him.

01:07:18.417 --> 01:07:20.459
Look, you translate everything I say,

01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:22.292
- word for word.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:23.834
You fucking prick!

01:07:23.917 --> 01:07:24.709
Oh...

01:07:24.751 --> 01:07:27.626
You loose-assed, dog-fucking
son of a whore!

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:28.917
So, uh...

01:07:28.959 --> 01:07:32.001
What kind of tourist hangs pictures
of dead people on his wall?

01:07:32.042 --> 01:07:34.376
Travel... the dead...

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:35.876
Why was this in your house?

01:07:35.917 --> 01:07:37.251
How did this...?

01:07:37.292 --> 01:07:39.459
Who the fuck are you?

01:07:39.501 --> 01:07:41.292
Who are you?

01:07:42.417 --> 01:07:44.709
I know what you're doing in this village.

01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:47.084
I saw that room.

01:07:47.126 --> 01:07:51.959
And I know what the fuck
you're doing to my daughter!

01:07:55.709 --> 01:07:57.001
I want you...

01:07:57.876 --> 01:08:02.084
to stop what you're doing,
and leave this village quietly.

01:08:02.709 --> 01:08:03.709
I mean it.

01:08:04.334 --> 01:08:05.667
Leave.

01:08:06.417 --> 01:08:07.792
Quietly.

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:10.417
This is Gokseong. My turf.

01:08:11.251 --> 01:08:13.001
Don't mess around

01:08:13.042 --> 01:08:16.167
and get yourself killed. Just leave.

01:08:16.209 --> 01:08:19.376
If you don't leave, you'll die.

01:08:22.501 --> 01:08:27.042
If you heard me, say something.
Or at least nod your fucking head!

01:08:27.084 --> 01:08:28.917
Please answer.

01:08:35.584 --> 01:08:38.209
So, you're...

01:08:38.251 --> 01:08:40.626
Shut up, bitch!

01:08:41.542 --> 01:08:43.667
You're blowing me off?

01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:45.292
Oh, I'm just not worth answering.

01:08:48.042 --> 01:08:49.459
Is that it?

01:08:52.001 --> 01:08:55.251
You're not even gonna listen, right?

01:08:55.834 --> 01:08:56.959
Ain't that right?

01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:59.917
I'm trying to speak to you,

01:09:00.501 --> 01:09:02.084
but you're not listening!

01:09:04.084 --> 01:09:05.251
What's this?

01:09:05.292 --> 01:09:06.667
What the fuck is this?

01:09:07.626 --> 01:09:09.667
What the hell is all this?

01:09:10.959 --> 01:09:12.126
What the...

01:09:13.334 --> 01:09:16.917
What the fuck are these
rituals you're doing?!

01:09:19.084 --> 01:09:21.251
What the fuck are you doing in my town!

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:26.542
Do you know whose daughter
you're messing with?

01:09:26.584 --> 01:09:27.917
Son of a bitch!

01:09:28.876 --> 01:09:30.042
Look out!

01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:09.917
Jong-gu?

01:10:35.626 --> 01:10:36.792
Now what?

01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:42.501
Starting to see the light?

01:10:46.292 --> 01:10:47.876
I'll give you three days.

01:10:48.667 --> 01:10:53.417
Get out, or you'll end up
like your goddamned dog.

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:56.292
Translate.

01:10:58.292 --> 01:11:00.251
Translate what I said.

01:11:25.667 --> 01:11:27.501
How long has it been like this?

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.584
Just a few days.

01:12:12.084 --> 01:12:13.376
So?

01:12:14.167 --> 01:12:15.709
The symptoms-

01:12:15.751 --> 01:12:17.167
they're the same as the others'.

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:22.584
There's gotta be an explanation
for what she has.

01:12:23.376 --> 01:12:24.876
They say they don't know.

01:12:51.626 --> 01:12:52.501
What is it?

01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:53.709
Oh God!

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:02.251
Who the fuck did this?

01:13:06.001 --> 01:13:07.334
What?!

01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:08.501
You okay?

01:13:08.542 --> 01:13:11.292
Get your husband.

01:13:11.876 --> 01:13:13.376
Who did this?

01:13:14.042 --> 01:13:16.001
Who the fuck did this?

01:13:16.376 --> 01:13:17.834
Jong-gu!

01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:21.959
Jong-gu!

01:13:22.042 --> 01:13:24.376
What's the matter!

01:13:32.584 --> 01:13:34.167
Does he drink a lot?

01:13:35.626 --> 01:13:37.042
It's nothing to worry about.

01:13:38.626 --> 01:13:40.459
I'll take the needles out in 20 minutes.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:45.251
Cut back on the drinking.

01:13:46.959 --> 01:13:48.542
Yeah.

01:13:52.251 --> 01:13:56.542
It's started. You better brace yourself.

01:13:59.084 --> 01:14:02.584
What I said the other
day-we'll do it tomorrow.

01:14:03.792 --> 01:14:05.417
Where is Hyo-jin?

01:14:05.459 --> 01:14:09.167
You can't back out now.
Get the money for the ritual.

01:14:09.209 --> 01:14:10.834
Where is she?

01:14:10.876 --> 01:14:12.792
At home. Where else would she be?

01:14:12.834 --> 01:14:14.959
I asked the old lady
next door to watch her.

01:14:15.001 --> 01:14:17.126
You left her alone with a stranger?

01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:19.792
Are you out of your minds?

01:14:20.251 --> 01:14:21.626
Don't move.

01:14:25.917 --> 01:14:28.584
Hyo-jin.

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:32.751
Baby.

01:14:40.917 --> 01:14:43.459
- What's the matter?
- Oh my God!

01:14:45.334 --> 01:14:46.376
Hyo-jin!

01:14:46.917 --> 01:14:48.084
Hyo-jin!

01:14:48.376 --> 01:14:49.959
Hyo-jin!

01:14:50.126 --> 01:14:52.292
Drop that, baby.

01:14:53.876 --> 01:14:56.459
Don't cry. It's okay.

01:14:57.126 --> 01:14:58.334
It's okay.

01:14:58.376 --> 01:14:59.584
It'll be okay.

01:15:03.751 --> 01:15:05.209
Quick! Call 911!

01:15:33.084 --> 01:15:35.376
This is all the work of that Jap.

01:15:37.626 --> 01:15:39.584
Ever since we went to his house,

01:15:40.292 --> 01:15:42.042
my body's been in pain.

01:15:42.959 --> 01:15:45.334
I'm burning up. I'm seeing things.

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:50.292
A man's face comes out of the wall.

01:15:52.001 --> 01:15:53.709
I don't think he's alive.

01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:59.334
We've gotta do something,

01:16:00.792 --> 01:16:05.167
or that bastard will get us first.

01:17:08.001 --> 01:17:10.209
Shut the damn door!

01:18:04.751 --> 01:18:06.126
What's in that jar?

01:18:07.001 --> 01:18:08.667
Which one?

01:18:09.001 --> 01:18:11.001
The one with the red lid.

01:18:11.126 --> 01:18:13.376
It's just soy sauce.

01:18:15.376 --> 01:18:18.126
Bring it over.

01:18:20.459 --> 01:18:22.626
What, are you deaf?

01:18:30.626 --> 01:18:33.209
Out of the way, come on.

01:18:36.626 --> 01:18:37.751
Stand back.

01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:51.459
What is that?

01:18:52.126 --> 01:18:54.251
I'll be fucked...

01:18:57.501 --> 01:19:00.417
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.

01:19:25.251 --> 01:19:28.542
You don't want to leave, do you?

01:19:44.126 --> 01:19:45.376
Let's go!

01:20:06.751 --> 01:20:07.792
Stop it!

01:20:41.084 --> 01:20:42.251
Hyo-jin!

01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:51.459
Come here, you!

01:21:15.084 --> 01:21:16.542
You met up with something recently

01:21:16.584 --> 01:21:18.709
you weren't supposed to?

01:21:23.626 --> 01:21:26.126
I don't follow you.

01:21:29.792 --> 01:21:32.292
Did you disturb someone?

01:21:35.834 --> 01:21:41.376
Of all the evil I've seen,
this is the strongest.

01:21:42.626 --> 01:21:44.542
You disturbed it.

01:21:44.959 --> 01:21:48.001
Oh, God! What do we do now?

01:21:48.917 --> 01:21:50.084
Who is it?

01:21:54.251 --> 01:21:56.084
Who did you disturb?

01:21:56.126 --> 01:21:57.834
Tell him.

01:22:05.001 --> 01:22:06.834
A Japanese man...

01:22:12.667 --> 01:22:14.292
I knew it.

01:22:15.751 --> 01:22:19.251
That's no man.

01:22:21.167 --> 01:22:23.167
That's a ghost.

01:22:45.376 --> 01:22:50.001
All the things happening
around here are his doing.

01:22:53.376 --> 01:22:57.042
If nothing is done, it's
not just your daughter,

01:22:57.709 --> 01:23:02.084
but everything that walks
on two feet will perish.

01:23:08.626 --> 01:23:10.042
Sir!

01:23:10.084 --> 01:23:13.376
This is Park Chun-bae. He owns this house.

01:23:15.876 --> 01:23:17.709
He killed his wife, too?

01:23:17.917 --> 01:23:19.167
It appears so.

01:23:19.209 --> 01:23:21.376
What's that bastard's name?

01:23:21.417 --> 01:23:23.292
Park Chun-bae.

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:26.626
Then what?

01:23:26.667 --> 01:23:30.334
What do you mean, what?
Gotta get rid of it.

01:23:32.459 --> 01:23:35.459
Either banish it, or kill it.

01:23:47.001 --> 01:23:50.667
I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow
at the hour of the dog.

01:23:54.459 --> 01:23:55.459
Yes, sir.

01:23:56.042 --> 01:23:57.292
You got the money?

01:23:58.042 --> 01:23:59.417
How much?

01:23:59.459 --> 01:24:01.417
About 10 grand, don't you think?

01:24:04.459 --> 01:24:06.126
I'll have it ready.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.459
Good.

01:24:14.917 --> 01:24:16.209
Listen.

01:24:16.876 --> 01:24:18.917
What I'm doing tomorrow-

01:24:20.376 --> 01:24:21.834
it's no ordinary ritual.

01:24:22.584 --> 01:24:24.584
I'll be casting a death hex.

01:24:25.542 --> 01:24:27.626
It's incredibly dangerous.

01:24:28.209 --> 01:24:31.042
So you can't do anything
that would taint it.

01:24:32.459 --> 01:24:37.167
No intercourse. Watch
what you eat and drink.

01:24:39.376 --> 01:24:41.042
Or the spell will backfire.

01:24:42.126 --> 01:24:43.126
Yes, sir.

01:24:44.334 --> 01:24:47.167
Okay then. You can go.

01:24:56.084 --> 01:24:59.584
Can I ask you something?

01:25:01.042 --> 01:25:02.167
What?

01:25:04.292 --> 01:25:05.792
That Japanese guy.

01:25:07.084 --> 01:25:09.876
You said he's a ghost.

01:25:10.667 --> 01:25:11.834
So?

01:25:11.876 --> 01:25:16.376
I don't get how a living
person can be a ghost.

01:25:22.042 --> 01:25:23.792
It's not a living human.

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:33.084
He died a long time ago.

01:25:35.251 --> 01:25:37.667
He must have been human once.

01:25:38.751 --> 01:25:40.334
But not anymore.

01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:45.334
So then,

01:25:46.376 --> 01:25:49.751
the ghost got inside him?

01:25:49.792 --> 01:25:51.917
Well, that's how it started.

01:25:57.334 --> 01:26:01.376
Not everything that moves,
breathes, and talks is alive.

01:26:02.834 --> 01:26:06.084
Countless people have perished
because they didn't understand that.

01:26:08.542 --> 01:26:10.167
If it's not stopped...

01:26:11.292 --> 01:26:16.501
that demon will destroy this village.

01:26:16.542 --> 01:26:17.626
Demon?

01:26:18.334 --> 01:26:20.209
An evil ghost!

01:26:20.584 --> 01:26:24.084
Even among other demons,
he's a master of evil.

01:26:31.001 --> 01:26:32.167
If that's true,

01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:36.292
why did it have to be...

01:26:36.334 --> 01:26:37.751
your daughter?

01:26:38.417 --> 01:26:40.959
What sin did that young girl ever commit?

01:26:41.876 --> 01:26:42.917
Yes.

01:26:44.626 --> 01:26:50.001
If you go fishing, do you
know what you'll catch?

01:26:50.959 --> 01:26:52.126
No.

01:26:54.001 --> 01:26:56.167
He's just fishing.

01:26:57.417 --> 01:27:00.834
Not even he knows what he'll catch.

01:27:01.792 --> 01:27:08.501
He just threw out the bait,
and your daughter took it.

01:27:11.667 --> 01:27:13.084
That's all it was.

01:27:22.417 --> 01:27:24.126
Park Chun-bae

01:27:43.251 --> 01:27:45.917
- This one?
- No.

01:27:47.876 --> 01:27:50.042
Money. Yes, money.

01:27:50.334 --> 01:27:52.792
21 dollars more.

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:55.209
- No!
- That's okay.

01:27:56.084 --> 01:27:57.626
Oh, come on.

01:31:29.834 --> 01:31:31.542
Tell him to stop.

01:32:10.376 --> 01:32:11.751
Stop!

01:32:13.251 --> 01:32:14.542
Stop!

01:32:17.751 --> 01:32:19.542
I said stop!

01:32:58.001 --> 01:33:00.125
Jong-gu!

01:33:00.542 --> 01:33:01.626
Jong-gu!

01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:10.834
What's the matter?

01:33:57.417 --> 01:33:58.417
Look at me.

01:34:29.292 --> 01:34:30.292
Baby?

01:34:31.834 --> 01:34:32.959
Baby?

01:35:12.209 --> 01:35:13.417
Hyo-jin!

01:35:50.334 --> 01:35:52.084
Please make him stop...

01:35:53.459 --> 01:35:55.084
Please...

01:35:57.667 --> 01:35:59.876
Please make him stop.

01:36:24.834 --> 01:36:26.042
Dad!

01:36:30.501 --> 01:36:31.959
Dad...

01:36:32.459 --> 01:36:33.334
Hyo-jin.

01:36:33.376 --> 01:36:34.834
We shouldn't do this...

01:36:42.167 --> 01:36:43.917
Stop, you bastards!

01:36:45.792 --> 01:36:47.167
Stop!

01:36:47.626 --> 01:36:49.251
Fucking bastards!

01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:52.209
Stop right now.

01:36:54.292 --> 01:36:55.584
Stop!

01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:57.584
Stop.

01:36:58.292 --> 01:37:00.417
I said stop!

01:37:00.626 --> 01:37:01.792
Stop.

01:37:01.876 --> 01:37:04.626
I'm gonna smash your heads in!

01:37:05.626 --> 01:37:06.959
Stop, I said.

01:37:07.667 --> 01:37:08.876
Get out.

01:37:09.542 --> 01:37:11.042
Now!

01:38:32.584 --> 01:38:35.542
Everything started on that day?

01:38:45.001 --> 01:38:47.751
I'll try speaking to the Father.

01:38:51.542 --> 01:38:55.626
What you're telling me is true?

01:38:56.751 --> 01:38:57.834
Yes.

01:39:04.542 --> 01:39:08.001
And you said the shaman told you this.

01:39:08.751 --> 01:39:11.167
From their perspective,

01:39:11.667 --> 01:39:15.667
a ghost is the spirit of a dead man.

01:39:17.292 --> 01:39:19.584
But that man is alive.

01:39:21.251 --> 01:39:24.334
I've heard about this man, too.

01:39:25.584 --> 01:39:27.959
Rumor has it he's a renowned professor.

01:39:28.667 --> 01:39:30.917
And there are darker,
more disturbing rumors-

01:39:31.876 --> 01:39:33.834
Some say he's a Buddhist monk.

01:39:34.042 --> 01:39:38.917
But they're just rumors.
How can you believe them?

01:39:38.959 --> 01:39:43.001
No, Father. They're definitely not rumors.

01:39:44.292 --> 01:39:47.126
You sound terribly sure.

01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:53.334
Did you see it with your own eyes?

01:39:55.501 --> 01:39:59.542
How can you be sure without
seeing for yourself?

01:40:01.459 --> 01:40:07.667
Take her back to the hospital.
Trust the doctor.

01:40:08.917 --> 01:40:11.959
There's nothing the Church
can do for you now.

01:40:17.626 --> 01:40:19.709
Come with me to the Jap's.

01:40:20.501 --> 01:40:21.917
Sorry?

01:40:21.959 --> 01:40:23.834
I gotta see for myself

01:40:25.001 --> 01:40:27.084
if he's really a ghost or not.

01:40:30.376 --> 01:40:31.876
If he is,

01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:35.626
then I won't be able to kill him.

01:41:11.251 --> 01:41:12.667
Where is he?

01:41:13.084 --> 01:41:13.876
Is everyone here?

01:41:13.917 --> 01:41:15.001
Yeah.

01:41:15.042 --> 01:41:17.167
Why'd you call us so early?

01:41:17.209 --> 01:41:19.334
Cheol-yeong couldn't come.
His sow is farrowing.

01:41:21.959 --> 01:41:23.292
What's with your face?

01:41:41.709 --> 01:41:45.667
This ain't a joke?

01:41:49.459 --> 01:41:50.876
You're serious, right?

01:41:52.126 --> 01:41:53.376
Yeah.

01:41:53.417 --> 01:41:55.501
Cross your heart, or your mom's a whore?

01:41:56.251 --> 01:41:57.876
You prick!

01:41:59.126 --> 01:42:00.876
This is no time for jokes.

01:42:00.917 --> 01:42:02.626
What a fucking loser.

01:42:13.251 --> 01:42:14.251
Go!

01:42:34.876 --> 01:42:36.334
- Nothing?
- No.

01:42:36.376 --> 01:42:38.876
Don't just stand around. Check the back.

01:43:25.876 --> 01:43:27.001
What's that?

01:43:28.667 --> 01:43:30.376
Fucking bastard...

01:43:31.459 --> 01:43:34.584
Byeong-gyu! Over here.

01:43:35.626 --> 01:43:38.626
Hurry up.

01:43:38.751 --> 01:43:39.667
Is that him?

01:43:39.709 --> 01:43:40.792
Over there.

01:43:40.834 --> 01:43:42.709
Where? Follow me.

01:43:43.084 --> 01:43:44.126
Where?

01:43:51.251 --> 01:43:52.334
What the...?

01:43:53.251 --> 01:43:54.501
Who's that?

01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:58.376
What is that thing?

01:44:02.001 --> 01:44:03.126
Don't come any closer.

01:44:03.167 --> 01:44:04.209
Back off.

01:44:22.126 --> 01:44:23.167
Back off.

01:44:28.126 --> 01:44:29.334
Stop it.

01:44:29.542 --> 01:44:32.042
That's enough, man!

01:44:33.626 --> 01:44:36.751
Sorry, man. You all right?

01:44:44.501 --> 01:44:45.584
Stop it!

01:44:46.501 --> 01:44:48.709
What are you doing to him?

01:44:48.792 --> 01:44:50.001
He's not... right...

01:44:50.042 --> 01:44:51.876
Put it down.

01:44:51.917 --> 01:44:54.084
- Let go!
- We can talk this out.

01:44:54.126 --> 01:44:55.126
E-sam!

01:47:13.917 --> 01:47:15.626
Dad...

01:47:16.417 --> 01:47:19.251
Look.

01:47:20.959 --> 01:47:22.376
There's another one!

01:47:36.876 --> 01:47:38.042
That's him.

01:47:38.501 --> 01:47:39.584
That's him!

01:47:40.251 --> 01:47:41.626
Get him!

01:47:45.167 --> 01:47:46.334
Get him!

01:47:46.542 --> 01:47:47.667
Where?

01:47:49.417 --> 01:47:50.501
Son of a bitch!

01:47:50.542 --> 01:47:52.084
There he is.

01:47:53.209 --> 01:47:54.334
Over there.

01:47:57.126 --> 01:47:58.126
Son of a bitch!

01:48:09.001 --> 01:48:10.084
Where is he?

01:48:10.209 --> 01:48:11.292
Over there.

01:48:12.001 --> 01:48:13.126
Where?

01:49:09.417 --> 01:49:10.417
What's wrong?

01:49:12.209 --> 01:49:14.001
- Come over here.
- What? Why did you stop?

01:49:16.667 --> 01:49:17.751
What's the matter?

01:49:18.917 --> 01:49:20.209
Come over here!

01:49:21.501 --> 01:49:22.584
Jong-gu.

01:49:27.834 --> 01:49:28.917
Where'd he go?

01:49:29.001 --> 01:49:30.292
Where is that bastard?

01:49:32.792 --> 01:49:34.001
Hey, man!

01:49:34.042 --> 01:49:36.292
Get down here.

01:49:36.334 --> 01:49:37.334
Do you see him?

01:49:37.376 --> 01:49:38.376
Hey!

01:49:38.584 --> 01:49:40.001
Where did he go?

01:49:42.126 --> 01:49:43.251
Jong-gu!

01:49:47.459 --> 01:49:48.626
I gotta catch him.

01:49:50.959 --> 01:49:52.334
Gotta catch that bastard.

01:49:54.126 --> 01:49:55.376
Catch that bastard.

01:49:59.209 --> 01:50:00.126
I can't believe this...

01:50:00.167 --> 01:50:02.209
- Gotta save my baby.
- Come on.

01:50:02.251 --> 01:50:02.917
Let's go down.

01:50:02.959 --> 01:50:04.292
I gotta save my little girl.

01:50:04.334 --> 01:50:06.667
- We'll get him.
- I've gotta find him, and save my baby.

01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:08.626
- Don't worry, we will.
- Okay?

01:50:10.584 --> 01:50:12.542
Get your act together, man.

01:50:12.626 --> 01:50:16.251
We gotta save her.

01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:18.209
I know, man.

01:50:18.917 --> 01:50:20.167
I know.

01:50:20.751 --> 01:50:23.709
I have to save my daughter...

01:50:24.001 --> 01:50:25.584
Come on, man.

01:50:29.959 --> 01:50:33.167
I have to catch that bastard.

01:50:34.334 --> 01:50:36.126
Don't cry, man.

01:50:37.417 --> 01:50:41.417
Dammit, Jong-gu!

01:52:49.917 --> 01:52:51.584
- Wife
- Please, pick up.

01:53:28.251 --> 01:53:32.751
Shit! Was that a person?

01:56:11.501 --> 01:56:14.667
Wife

01:56:23.917 --> 01:56:30.376
The rat fell into the trap.

01:57:24.334 --> 01:57:25.834
You all right, baby?

01:57:31.626 --> 01:57:32.917
You okay?

01:57:33.126 --> 01:57:34.917
I'm okay.

01:57:37.584 --> 01:57:38.876
Come here.

01:57:50.959 --> 01:57:52.334
You're okay now?

01:57:55.334 --> 01:57:56.626
You're okay now?

01:58:16.584 --> 01:58:17.959
Drink up.

01:58:18.667 --> 01:58:20.001
Good girl.

01:58:50.501 --> 01:58:51.876
Leave it.

01:58:52.584 --> 01:58:54.001
I want to tidy up a little.

01:58:54.042 --> 01:58:57.792
Leave it. We've got the shaman
to thank for everything.

01:58:58.501 --> 01:59:01.042
Get some rest. You must be exhausted.

01:59:04.792 --> 01:59:06.417
Shaman

01:59:14.417 --> 01:59:15.917
Damn fool.

01:59:29.334 --> 01:59:34.126
Suspect arrested in the
mushroom-tonic case...

01:59:40.459 --> 01:59:44.042
Victims have developed
severe mental derangement...

01:59:50.292 --> 01:59:51.626
Mr. Yang E-sam?

01:59:51.667 --> 01:59:52.751
Yes.

01:59:58.501 --> 02:00:00.542
The landlady was a victim.

02:00:01.501 --> 02:00:03.501
Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too.

02:00:04.334 --> 02:00:06.459
It's turned the town upside down.

02:00:08.251 --> 02:00:09.917
We've gotta bring him in.

02:00:10.334 --> 02:00:13.709
You should get a lawyer.

02:00:14.792 --> 02:00:16.167
After all,

02:00:17.667 --> 02:00:19.334
he's a victim, too.

02:00:48.834 --> 02:00:50.917
What the fuck?

02:01:12.209 --> 02:01:13.917
What are you doing here?

02:01:31.042 --> 02:01:32.251
Get out.

02:01:54.001 --> 02:01:56.209
Missed calls - Shaman

02:03:53.167 --> 02:03:54.626
What the hell?

02:03:58.417 --> 02:03:59.667
What the...?

02:04:58.751 --> 02:04:59.501
Hello.

02:04:59.542 --> 02:05:01.001
It's me.

02:05:01.542 --> 02:05:02.834
Where are you?

02:05:02.959 --> 02:05:04.209
What about you?

02:05:04.251 --> 02:05:05.917
Don't ask me anything.

02:05:06.126 --> 02:05:09.376
You need to get to your daughter. Now.

02:05:09.417 --> 02:05:11.376
Tell me what's going on?

02:05:11.417 --> 02:05:13.334
I'm at your place.

02:05:13.376 --> 02:05:18.001
Get back to your house, now.

02:05:18.042 --> 02:05:21.501
First tell me what's going on.

02:05:23.584 --> 02:05:24.959
I...

02:05:26.251 --> 02:05:29.917
I misread the divination.

02:05:31.251 --> 02:05:32.834
It's not him.

02:05:34.501 --> 02:05:36.084
What are you talking about?

02:05:37.501 --> 02:05:39.584
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.

02:05:40.626 --> 02:05:43.126
I saw a woman in front of your house.

02:05:43.709 --> 02:05:47.126
I made a grave mistake.

02:05:47.834 --> 02:05:50.209
A terrible, terrible mistake.

02:05:53.792 --> 02:05:55.417
It's not the Japanese man.

02:05:55.542 --> 02:05:57.376
That woman is the evil spirit.

02:05:58.251 --> 02:05:59.959
It was all her doing.

02:06:00.334 --> 02:06:02.167
So, go home now.

02:06:02.209 --> 02:06:03.792
I'm on my way there, too.

02:06:04.584 --> 02:06:05.876
Then...

02:06:08.251 --> 02:06:09.501
Who's the Japanese man?

02:06:09.542 --> 02:06:13.084
He was trying to kill that woman

02:06:14.084 --> 02:06:17.167
in order to save people from her.

02:06:17.584 --> 02:06:18.834
Understand?

02:06:19.417 --> 02:06:21.209
That Japanese man-

02:06:23.292 --> 02:06:24.876
he's a shaman, like me.

02:06:32.667 --> 02:06:34.001
Was the woman...

02:06:34.834 --> 02:06:35.917
wearing white?

02:06:40.084 --> 02:06:41.417
Did you see her?

02:06:46.459 --> 02:06:47.792
A young woman?

02:06:49.459 --> 02:06:51.042
That's her.

02:06:59.626 --> 02:07:01.959
Defend us in battle.

02:07:02.959 --> 02:07:06.209
Be our safeguard against the wickedness

02:07:07.709 --> 02:07:09.417
and snares of the devil.

02:07:30.542 --> 02:07:31.667
Where is she?

02:07:34.292 --> 02:07:35.959
Where's Hyo-jin?!

02:08:31.001 --> 02:08:32.292
Hyo-jin!

02:08:42.542 --> 02:08:43.626
What is it?

02:08:47.501 --> 02:08:49.501
Where are you headed in the dark of night?

02:09:01.209 --> 02:09:02.584
I'm asking you.

02:09:04.042 --> 02:09:05.459
Where is my daughter?

02:09:08.209 --> 02:09:09.584
Where is she?

02:09:14.876 --> 02:09:16.376
Girl about this tall?

02:09:17.209 --> 02:09:18.376
Yeah.

02:09:24.417 --> 02:09:25.709
Hyo-jin?

02:09:27.126 --> 02:09:28.167
That's right.

02:09:28.876 --> 02:09:31.292
She's possessed by an evil spirit.

02:09:32.376 --> 02:09:36.001
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.

02:09:37.417 --> 02:09:38.727
He's trying to suck her blood dry...

02:09:38.751 --> 02:09:40.292
Shut the fuck up!

02:09:41.459 --> 02:09:43.126
Answer me, bitch!

02:09:44.126 --> 02:09:45.667
Where is Hyo-jin?

02:09:47.292 --> 02:09:50.251
- Have you seen the Jap?
- Where's my daughter?

02:09:51.417 --> 02:09:53.667
At your home, where else?

02:09:53.709 --> 02:09:54.959
She's not home.

02:09:55.001 --> 02:09:56.292
She is.

02:09:57.626 --> 02:09:58.917
She just got back.

02:10:04.042 --> 02:10:05.459
Don't go now-

02:10:07.584 --> 02:10:09.084
or you'll all die.

02:10:09.667 --> 02:10:12.251
If you go now, your whole
family will perish.

02:10:20.334 --> 02:10:21.834
What are you talking about?

02:10:44.834 --> 02:10:47.501
The Jap is waiting for you...

02:10:48.209 --> 02:10:51.667
to annihilate your family.

02:10:54.126 --> 02:10:55.751
He's dead.

02:10:56.042 --> 02:10:57.209
He's not dead.

02:10:59.667 --> 02:11:01.417
Death cannot touch him.

02:11:05.376 --> 02:11:09.042
The demon will soon enter your home.

02:11:11.542 --> 02:11:13.209
You've seen the demon?

02:11:15.834 --> 02:11:19.209
At the house of the hanged woman.

02:11:25.959 --> 02:11:27.084
It was a dream.

02:11:27.792 --> 02:11:28.792
It was no dream.

02:12:02.167 --> 02:12:04.042
I laid a trap for it.

02:12:05.042 --> 02:12:06.917
Wait here, until he's caught.

02:12:08.042 --> 02:12:09.084
That's all you need to do.

02:12:12.334 --> 02:12:16.334
What are you?

02:12:20.376 --> 02:12:22.084
A woman or a ghost?

02:12:22.917 --> 02:12:24.334
Why do you ask?

02:12:25.001 --> 02:12:26.417
I need to know...

02:12:28.084 --> 02:12:29.501
If I can put my faith in you.

02:12:30.376 --> 02:12:31.584
Just believe,

02:12:32.417 --> 02:12:33.792
and your family will be saved.

02:12:33.834 --> 02:12:35.501
What are you?

02:12:52.001 --> 02:12:54.084
Someone trying to save your daughter.

02:12:57.251 --> 02:12:58.501
A woman.

02:13:01.167 --> 02:13:04.792
I called all her friends...

02:13:10.126 --> 02:13:11.334
Hyo-jin?

02:13:11.584 --> 02:13:12.834
Hyo-jin!

02:13:15.584 --> 02:13:16.709
Baby.

02:13:17.126 --> 02:13:18.376
Baby...

02:13:33.417 --> 02:13:36.501
When will the demon come?

02:13:38.376 --> 02:13:39.917
It's already there.

02:13:50.667 --> 02:13:51.792
Hyo-jin.

02:13:53.126 --> 02:13:55.626
It's already there?

02:14:06.751 --> 02:14:08.251
Let me ask you one thing.

02:14:10.834 --> 02:14:14.334
What is your true form?

02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:59.709
What do you think is my true form?

02:15:00.292 --> 02:15:01.542
The devil.

02:15:02.876 --> 02:15:04.542
You're the devil.

02:15:08.292 --> 02:15:09.584
Why can't you answer?

02:15:10.209 --> 02:15:12.417
You've already said it.

02:15:15.001 --> 02:15:16.834
I'm the devil.

02:15:19.042 --> 02:15:21.251
Shaman

02:15:30.876 --> 02:15:31.876
I'm almost there.

02:15:31.917 --> 02:15:33.417
Where are you? Are you home?

02:15:34.334 --> 02:15:37.792
I'm with the woman now.

02:15:38.876 --> 02:15:42.417
You mustn't let her tempt you.

02:15:42.584 --> 02:15:43.709
Never.

02:15:43.751 --> 02:15:45.501
Whatever she tells you,

02:15:45.626 --> 02:15:48.376
you must go to your daughter now.

02:15:48.417 --> 02:15:50.001
Do you understand me?

02:15:50.167 --> 02:15:51.167
Understand?

02:15:53.292 --> 02:15:54.667
Do you?

02:15:58.876 --> 02:16:00.167
Is that your shaman?

02:16:05.167 --> 02:16:06.959
Don't believe what he tells you.

02:16:07.876 --> 02:16:09.251
They're in on it together.

02:16:10.209 --> 02:16:11.417
Isn't that right?

02:16:13.084 --> 02:16:17.584
You're already certain I'm the devil.

02:16:18.626 --> 02:16:20.376
That's why you came here...

02:16:21.334 --> 02:16:22.917
carrying that sickle.

02:16:32.626 --> 02:16:38.001
My words, whatever I say-

02:16:38.041 --> 02:16:40.001
they won't change your mind.

02:16:40.041 --> 02:16:41.166
No.

02:16:42.166 --> 02:16:43.541
That's not true.

02:16:44.459 --> 02:16:46.291
There's no doubt.

02:16:46.959 --> 02:16:52.916
You came here
to confirm your suspicions about me.

02:16:52.959 --> 02:16:54.126
That's not true!

02:16:57.126 --> 02:16:58.126
If you say

02:16:58.916 --> 02:17:02.666
you're not the devil,

02:17:03.501 --> 02:17:06.041
and reveal your true form to me-

02:17:08.541 --> 02:17:10.209
I'll leave you alone.

02:17:12.876 --> 02:17:14.959
When the demon is snared,

02:17:16.376 --> 02:17:19.291
the rooster will cry three times.

02:17:22.834 --> 02:17:24.251
Wait until the third cry.

02:17:30.291 --> 02:17:36.291
You'll leave me alone?

02:17:38.376 --> 02:17:39.501
Yes.

02:17:44.291 --> 02:17:45.834
Two more.

02:17:51.209 --> 02:17:52.459
Do not waver.

02:17:57.541 --> 02:17:59.334
You'll leave?

02:18:00.001 --> 02:18:01.209
Yes.

02:18:01.959 --> 02:18:03.626
I'll leave you alone.

02:18:24.001 --> 02:18:26.791
Who said I'd let you leave?

02:18:31.876 --> 02:18:36.126
Then let me ask you one thing.

02:18:36.459 --> 02:18:37.584
What?

02:18:37.626 --> 02:18:42.251
Why in God's name is he doing this?

02:18:43.084 --> 02:18:46.959
Because her father has sinned.

02:18:47.501 --> 02:18:48.501
What sin?

02:18:51.376 --> 02:18:52.791
What sin did I commit?

02:18:53.541 --> 02:18:57.584
Her father suspected another.

02:18:58.251 --> 02:19:02.166
He tried to kill him,
and finally succeeded.

02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:07.126
But my daughter...!

02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:10.084
My daughter...

02:19:10.666 --> 02:19:13.416
My daughter got sick first!

02:19:14.041 --> 02:19:15.459
How can that...

02:19:23.666 --> 02:19:24.709
How can that possibly...

02:19:24.791 --> 02:19:28.291
One more, now.

02:19:36.416 --> 02:19:37.584
How can that be...?

02:19:59.292 --> 02:20:00.542
Don't do it.

02:20:02.876 --> 02:20:04.376
What are you saying?

02:20:06.001 --> 02:20:10.042
Whether you walk out of here or not
is completely up to you.

02:20:18.917 --> 02:20:20.584
Touch me and see.

02:20:25.501 --> 02:20:30.417
A ghost does not have flesh and bones,

02:20:30.667 --> 02:20:37.667
and you see I have both.

02:21:02.876 --> 02:21:04.667
Park Chun-bae

02:21:06.459 --> 02:21:07.542
No.

02:21:08.834 --> 02:21:10.209
That's not it.

02:21:13.376 --> 02:21:14.542
It's you.

02:21:14.834 --> 02:21:15.917
No.

02:21:16.167 --> 02:21:17.876
This is all your doing.

02:21:23.459 --> 02:21:24.417
Don't do it.

02:21:24.459 --> 02:21:25.626
Hyo-jin...

02:21:27.667 --> 02:21:28.876
Don't do it.

02:21:29.084 --> 02:21:30.209
Hyo-jin...

02:21:31.334 --> 02:21:34.626
No!

02:21:44.376 --> 02:21:45.626
What are you doing?

02:21:47.917 --> 02:21:49.042
Don't!

02:21:49.501 --> 02:21:51.876
Why are you troubled?

02:22:17.667 --> 02:22:18.751
Hyo-jin.

02:22:31.417 --> 02:22:32.626
Honey...

02:22:36.167 --> 02:22:37.376
Mother...

02:24:33.709 --> 02:24:35.875
Look at me.

02:24:36.459 --> 02:24:39.001
Look at me!

02:24:39.751 --> 02:24:41.001
Please.

02:24:41.042 --> 02:24:44.876
Look at me.

02:24:46.709 --> 02:24:47.959
Please...

02:24:48.751 --> 02:24:50.709
Please!

02:25:10.834 --> 02:25:12.626
Hyo-jin!

02:25:13.667 --> 02:25:16.292
Hyo-jin...

02:25:24.084 --> 02:25:25.209
Hyo-jin.

02:25:30.876 --> 02:25:32.292
Hyo-jin.

02:25:35.167 --> 02:25:36.876
Hyo-jin...

02:25:40.084 --> 02:25:42.792
Hyo-jin!

02:25:58.542 --> 02:26:02.792
Why is there doubt in your heart?

02:26:16.376 --> 02:26:19.584
See my hands, and my feet.

02:26:36.084 --> 02:26:37.876
You can see it is I.

02:26:46.459 --> 02:26:47.917
Myself.

02:27:04.834 --> 02:27:06.459
Oh Lord...

02:29:15.251 --> 02:29:16.709
Hyo-jin...

02:29:56.001 --> 02:29:57.709
It's okay.

02:30:02.917 --> 02:30:05.334
My baby.

02:30:10.084 --> 02:30:13.792
You know Daddy's a policeman.

02:30:18.167 --> 02:30:23.501
I'll take care of everything.

02:30:30.626 --> 02:30:32.709
Daddy will.
