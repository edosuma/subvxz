BANSHEE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

00:59.109 --> 01:00.608
Is the sheriff in?

01:00.710 --> 01:02.777
Sheriff Lotus is in a meeting.
Can I help you?

01:04.414 --> 01:07.148
I have information he needs to hear.

01:15.192 --> 01:17.225
Can I help you, ma'am?

01:18.395 --> 01:19.995
He wants you to know he won't stop.

01:20.097 --> 01:22.263
Taking those girls was
just the beginning.

01:22.366 --> 01:24.732
- What is this?
- He wants you to see.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.002
You will all see.

01:27.104 --> 01:28.436
What the hell are you doing?

01:28.538 --> 01:30.405
Don't! No!

01:30.507 --> 01:33.108
Don't do it!

03:41.938 --> 03:43.738
Calvin.

03:48.345 --> 03:50.745
Where have you been?

03:55.018 --> 03:56.751
What happened to you?

03:56.853 --> 03:58.853
Is that blood?

04:00.123 --> 04:02.357
- Calvin. Cal...
- Quiet.

04:05.195 --> 04:06.861
Get... stop, please. Stop.

04:06.963 --> 04:08.429
What the fuck is wrong with you?

04:08.532 --> 04:11.166
Nothing, just not so rough.

04:11.268 --> 04:14.269
- Please.
- Jesus.

04:14.371 --> 04:16.671
Wait a second. Are you
screwing somebody else?

04:16.773 --> 04:20.241
What? No. Of course not.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.545
We haven't fucked in months. What is it?

04:23.647 --> 04:26.080
You just...

04:26.183 --> 04:28.216
you scared me.

04:29.286 --> 04:31.286
You scared me.

04:41.931 --> 04:44.965
What happened? What's going on?

04:45.068 --> 04:47.101
What happened to you?

04:54.744 --> 04:56.578
No, Calvin.

04:58.114 --> 05:00.448
Calvin. Calvin.

05:53.102 --> 05:56.203
Shower's all yours.

05:59.676 --> 06:01.643
Help yourself.

06:01.745 --> 06:03.778
Not really my thing.

06:13.923 --> 06:16.291
You know, I started out in undercover.

06:16.393 --> 06:20.094
Pretty white chicks have to go a little
bit further to prove themselves.

06:20.196 --> 06:23.331
So it was either fuck 'em

06:23.433 --> 06:25.566
or smoke their shit.

06:25.669 --> 06:27.168
Sometimes it was both.

06:27.270 --> 06:29.270
You don't have to
explain yourself to me.

06:31.174 --> 06:33.441
I've been meaning to kick it.

06:33.543 --> 06:37.945
But when you spend your days
up to your neck in this shit,

06:38.047 --> 06:40.815
sometimes I got to get
out of my own head.

06:41.851 --> 06:43.751
Do I need to worry about you?

06:43.853 --> 06:45.687
No.

06:45.789 --> 06:48.356
Might be nice if you did.

06:51.027 --> 06:55.596
Wow, you, my friend, have
some intimacy issues.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.233
Thanks for letting me crash.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.968
Could have shared the bed.

07:01.070 --> 07:03.237
Just saying.

08:40.636 --> 08:43.102
Who the fuck are you?

08:50.680 --> 08:52.413
Maggie.

08:52.515 --> 08:54.816
- Kurt.
- What's wrong?

08:54.918 --> 08:57.518
- It... it's...
- You want to sit for a second?

08:57.620 --> 08:59.821
No, I don't want to sit.

09:00.824 --> 09:03.424
Helen, you think you could get Hank here

09:03.526 --> 09:05.326
one of those snacks
that you keep upstairs?

09:05.428 --> 09:07.528
Sure. Hi, Hank.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.997
Want to come with me?

09:10.099 --> 09:12.032
Thank you.

09:14.571 --> 09:16.337
Come here.

09:20.877 --> 09:24.144
What happened? Did he hurt you?

09:26.382 --> 09:27.782
That motherfucker.

09:27.884 --> 09:30.952
I left. I couldn't be in
that house another second.

09:31.053 --> 09:33.253
- He let you leave?
- He doesn't know.

09:33.356 --> 09:36.323
I just grabbed Hank

09:36.425 --> 09:38.659
and packed things and...

09:40.062 --> 09:41.596
I don't even know where I'm going, Kurt.

09:41.698 --> 09:44.465
- You'll stay with me.
- I can't.

09:44.567 --> 09:46.433
That's the first place
he's gonna come look.

09:46.536 --> 09:48.268
Not if I find him first.

09:48.371 --> 09:49.670
No.

09:49.772 --> 09:52.339
No, I have to think about Hank.

09:54.076 --> 09:56.477
Kurt,

09:56.579 --> 09:59.013
I think he killed my father.

10:02.284 --> 10:03.584
Randall's dead?

10:03.686 --> 10:06.053
I don't know. They left
together and then...

10:06.155 --> 10:09.624
and then Calvin... and
he was covered in blood.

10:09.726 --> 10:11.626
And... and then he...

10:11.728 --> 10:13.394
it was... he was terrifying.

10:13.496 --> 10:15.329
Okay.

10:15.431 --> 10:17.364
It's okay.

10:21.771 --> 10:24.005
That's my mother's sweater.

10:24.106 --> 10:26.273
It is.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.275
She never wears it.

10:30.079 --> 10:32.580
- It looks good on you.
- Most things do.

10:32.682 --> 10:35.282
You best clean that glass up
before your mother gets home.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.552
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

10:40.322 --> 10:44.091
So how do you fit into
this whole shit show?

10:47.030 --> 10:50.031
Your mother and your father and I

10:50.132 --> 10:51.666
go way back.

10:51.768 --> 10:53.834
Yeah? Which father?

10:55.939 --> 10:58.372
The one that gave you that smart mouth.

10:58.474 --> 10:59.473
Got it.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.576
So is she Carrie or Ana to you?

11:01.678 --> 11:04.511
There weren't no Carrie
before I invented her.

11:04.614 --> 11:07.214
Well, I could use a
shiny new life myself.

11:07.316 --> 11:09.917
You want to hook me up?
I figure you owe me.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.253
Ain't you the fucked-up
little delinquent?

11:13.355 --> 11:17.424
Hey, I'm just trying to play
the shitty hand I was dealt.

11:17.526 --> 11:19.493
Girl, what you were dealt

11:19.596 --> 11:22.529
were two parents who would
kill or die for you.

11:25.334 --> 11:28.803
That's a hell of a lot more
than most people got.

11:29.872 --> 11:32.306
Deva.

11:32.408 --> 11:33.941
What are you doing here?

11:34.043 --> 11:35.810
Missed you, too, Mom.

11:36.813 --> 11:39.113
I'm just surprised to see you.

11:40.349 --> 11:42.083
You changed the locks on the door again.

11:42.184 --> 11:43.951
Sorry, I should have told you.

11:44.053 --> 11:45.886
- Does Grandma know you're here?
- I left her a note.

11:45.989 --> 11:47.655
I really don't think they'll miss me.

11:47.757 --> 11:49.423
- Deva.
- I'm not going back, Mom.

11:49.525 --> 11:51.458
There's no Wi-Fi and it
smells like ass there.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.460
- Honey, if the court finds out...
- They won't.

11:53.562 --> 11:56.163
- I know I can keep a secret.
- You stay out of this.

11:59.335 --> 12:03.170
If it makes it any easier, you
really don't have a choice.

12:04.707 --> 12:06.707
All right, so why don't
we just arrest Calvin?

12:06.809 --> 12:08.743
She'll never testify against him.

12:08.845 --> 12:10.377
She's terrified.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.847
She thinks Calvin killed her father.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.284
Does Calvin know?

12:17.386 --> 12:20.187
- Does Calvin know what?
- About you two.

12:27.030 --> 12:28.763
- No.
- You sure?

12:28.865 --> 12:30.264
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you didn't think I could tell

12:30.366 --> 12:32.266
and it took me all of about
10 seconds to see it.

12:32.368 --> 12:34.434
Now, granted, I'm a
smarter than average cop

12:34.537 --> 12:36.704
- and he's a hatemongering asshole.
- Calvin doesn't know.

12:44.814 --> 12:46.613
They can stay at my place.

12:48.117 --> 12:49.516
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:49.618 --> 12:52.153
Just until you find a way
to take your brother down.

12:52.254 --> 12:54.254
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.559
Hey, you okay, by the way?

12:58.661 --> 13:00.695
This morning, the burning.

13:00.797 --> 13:03.263
Must have hit pretty close to home?

13:05.568 --> 13:08.069
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:08.171 --> 13:12.439
Can't... get that smell out of my head.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.376
It takes a while.

13:28.467 --> 13:30.531
SUNNYSIDE CLEANERS

13:30.760 --> 13:33.460
- Can I help you?
- I highly doubt it.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.295
You can't go back there.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.732
- You can't go back there.
- I know.

13:37.834 --> 13:40.034
That's the swelling, babe.
They'll soften up...

13:40.136 --> 13:42.469
- Sweet Jesus.
- Hey, hey, you can't be in here.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.105
And yet I am. FBI.

13:44.207 --> 13:47.108
Honey, get out of here.

13:49.678 --> 13:52.113
Dr. David Quick.

13:52.215 --> 13:54.414
I have been looking for you.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.922
What's up, Doc?

14:05.161 --> 14:06.727
Why don't you take a seat?

14:06.829 --> 14:09.163
Should we try that again?

14:09.265 --> 14:10.865
Performing breast augmentation

14:10.967 --> 14:13.734
after being stripped of your medical
license, now, that's a felony.

14:13.836 --> 14:16.170
We don't perform any procedures here.
Tiffany is a friend of mine.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.972
She asked me to look at
her boob job, that's all.

14:18.074 --> 14:20.841
- So why'd you run?
- I don't like cops.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.677
Hey, you can't go in there, buddy.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.512
You got a warrant?

14:25.614 --> 14:27.581
I don't need one.

14:27.683 --> 14:29.083
I'm not a cop.

14:29.185 --> 14:31.786
Yeah, look, we can go down that road,

14:31.888 --> 14:35.890
but it's tangled and boring and
in the end, you'll still lose.

14:35.992 --> 14:38.392
Or you can answer a few questions

14:38.494 --> 14:41.862
and I'll forget we ever met.

14:42.524 --> 14:44.298
Over here.

14:45.734 --> 14:47.734
Okay.

14:47.837 --> 14:48.936
What do you want to know?

14:49.038 --> 14:51.038
- Body modifications.
- What about it?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.207
- You do it?
- Now and then. It's a growing field.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.909
So you must do some
pretty fucked-up shit.

14:55.011 --> 14:57.044
Not as fucked up as
the shit I turn down.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.280
You wouldn't believe the
kind of things people want.

14:59.381 --> 15:02.183
Hey, Jesus, man!

15:02.285 --> 15:03.550
Shit's expensive.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.419
I'm looking for a guy
with horn implants.

15:05.521 --> 15:07.754
- You ever do anything like that?
- Yeah.

15:07.857 --> 15:10.257
Well, then whip out your files, Doc.

15:10.359 --> 15:13.760
We don't keep files on
that kind of stuff.

15:13.863 --> 15:16.797
I can't imagine devil horns
is a common request.

15:16.899 --> 15:18.665
They're more common than you think.

15:18.767 --> 15:21.035
It's Satan's country out here.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.103
Yeah, but still, it's pretty unique,

15:23.206 --> 15:24.571
even for a guy like you.

15:24.673 --> 15:26.040
Who was the last guy you did?

15:26.142 --> 15:27.441
I'm sure you remember something.

15:27.543 --> 15:29.576
The kind of people who want this shit,

15:29.678 --> 15:31.378
they're not exactly model citizens.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.048
I take cash in advance. I
don't even ask their names.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.516
How convenient for you.

15:36.618 --> 15:38.118
This is bullshit.

15:38.221 --> 15:39.586
I'm gonna call my lawyer.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.521
Let's go.

15:41.623 --> 15:43.224
He doesn't know anything.

15:48.898 --> 15:53.767
This has not been a satisfying
conversation for me, Dr. Quick.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.971
If I were you, I'd call me.

15:58.407 --> 16:00.607
Thank you.

16:02.245 --> 16:04.144
I barely started working that guy.

16:04.247 --> 16:05.746
He wasn't gonna talk.

16:05.848 --> 16:07.414
This might help.

16:07.516 --> 16:09.250
That was on his desk.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.786
You, my friend, have
some serious skills.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.621
He was watching you the
whole time, so was I.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.757
- How'd you do it?
- That's the trick, isn't it?

16:18.660 --> 16:21.061
Just when I thought I'd seen it all.

16:22.865 --> 16:27.902
Wow, amazing what low self-esteem
can do to a sociopath.

16:35.601 --> 16:38.601
BANSHEE CITY HALL

16:42.218 --> 16:44.084
I've been trying to reach you.

16:44.186 --> 16:45.152
I've been busy.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.421
We have a problem, Deputy Cruz?

16:47.523 --> 16:49.823
Not at all. But speaking of problems,

16:49.926 --> 16:51.858
remember that matter you
asked me to look into?

16:51.961 --> 16:54.395
- Yeah.
- I looked into it.

16:54.496 --> 16:55.896
You found him?

16:55.998 --> 16:58.132
No, I found her.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.100
Exhibit number four was also turned in

17:00.202 --> 17:04.338
to our hearing officer five
days before this trial began.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.606
Now, if it pleases the court,
you'll note that the photograph

17:06.708 --> 17:09.709
shows the remnants of a
crushed back side door.

17:09.811 --> 17:12.846
- This photograph was taken at
the scene... - Mrs. Hopewell.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.983
...of a hit-and-run five months
back at the intersection...

17:16.085 --> 17:20.220
I'm seeing you around the
courthouse quite often these days.

17:20.323 --> 17:23.589
Taking an interest in the law?

17:23.692 --> 17:26.193
You could say that.

17:29.165 --> 17:31.731
You know, I never really had the chance

17:31.834 --> 17:35.302
to offer my condolences for
the loss of your husband.

17:37.239 --> 17:39.006
You hated Gordon.

17:39.108 --> 17:42.109
No, didn't hate him.

17:42.211 --> 17:43.777
I respected him.

17:43.879 --> 17:46.213
I never took it personally.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.482
I'd like to think he didn't either.

17:52.688 --> 17:54.621
He did.

17:57.826 --> 18:02.496
Well, either way, I was very
sorry to hear about it.

18:07.203 --> 18:09.336
I'm sorry about your niece.

18:11.073 --> 18:14.174
We both suffered a great loss.

18:15.844 --> 18:19.146
You know, sometimes a loss like that

18:19.248 --> 18:21.348
clouds the judgment.

18:22.751 --> 18:26.620
Makes us do things impulsively.

18:26.722 --> 18:28.288
Things we might regret.

18:28.391 --> 18:30.590
Do you know what I mean?

18:32.261 --> 18:34.328
No, not really.

18:34.430 --> 18:38.832
No? Well, I'd watch out for it.

18:38.934 --> 18:40.967
You still have so much to lose.

18:44.940 --> 18:47.074
I guess we all do.

18:51.280 --> 18:54.214
I suppose we both
should be more careful.

19:21.977 --> 19:23.643
Remember me, sunshine?

19:23.745 --> 19:26.080
Yeah, the bitch who didn't know
when to stop asking questions.

19:26.182 --> 19:28.848
You remembered. I'm so flattered.

19:28.951 --> 19:30.617
I'm also the bitch with the badge.

19:30.719 --> 19:32.719
Did I not mention that the other day?

19:32.821 --> 19:35.355
- I don't want any trouble, all right?
- Now that's the spirit.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.591
We're looking for a
guy with devil horns.

19:37.693 --> 19:40.561
- You got people like that in here?
- Yeah, body mods.

19:40.662 --> 19:42.296
Right, well, this guy is killing girls.

19:42.398 --> 19:45.499
Why don't you scroll through here,
see if you recognize anyone?

19:45.601 --> 19:49.270
Look, most of the so-called Satanists
that come in here are tourists.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.071
They're assholes looking
to be more edgier

19:51.173 --> 19:53.039
and bad-ass than they really are.

19:53.142 --> 19:56.110
With the exception of this guy.

19:58.147 --> 19:59.580
Who's this?

19:59.681 --> 20:01.948
That's Bode. Declan Bode.

20:02.050 --> 20:03.350
He's a hardcore ritualist.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.486
- Does he come here often?
- Nah, used to a while back.

20:05.588 --> 20:08.655
Feeling people out. Maybe looking
for followers. I don't know.

20:08.757 --> 20:11.391
Nobody took to the guy 'cause
he was a little too committed.

20:11.494 --> 20:13.594
So you're talking about a
guy who was so twisted,

20:13.695 --> 20:16.263
he creeped out other Satanists? Got it.

20:16.365 --> 20:18.365
- Where do we find him?
- Fuck if I know.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.867
- You knew his name. - Yeah, and
that's all I'm telling you, cop.

20:20.969 --> 20:23.036
- Where do we fucking find him?!
- I don't fucking know, man.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.671
- Where?!
- I don't fucking know.

20:24.773 --> 20:27.807
The fucking guy thinks the Devil
works through him, all right?

20:27.909 --> 20:29.610
One night the freak comes in here,

20:29.711 --> 20:31.612
starts spouting off about how
he's talking to Lucifer.

20:31.713 --> 20:34.714
I tell him he's full of shit. Guy takes
the paring knife out of my hand,

20:34.816 --> 20:36.983
starts peeling back his
fingernails one by one,

20:37.085 --> 20:38.718
smiling the whole time.

20:38.820 --> 20:42.289
Then he orders a drink.
Who the fuck does that?

20:42.391 --> 20:43.923
Someone we should meet.

20:44.026 --> 20:47.694
See? When we're helping, we're happy.

21:51.993 --> 21:55.362
Yeah? Well, that's interesting.

21:55.464 --> 21:56.896
Okay.

21:56.998 --> 21:59.399
All right, thanks. I'll call you back.

22:01.437 --> 22:04.638
Our boy Declan Bode doesn't
have much of a footprint.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.607
No known address. No relatives.

22:06.709 --> 22:08.242
But he does have a prior.

22:08.344 --> 22:11.845
He was convicted of statutory rape
15 years ago next county over.

22:11.947 --> 22:14.348
- Girl's name is sealed.
- Can we get it unsealed?

22:14.450 --> 22:16.883
Yes, but I will need a court order,

22:16.985 --> 22:18.785
which won't happen until tomorrow.

22:18.887 --> 22:20.587
Oh, Jesus Christ.

22:21.690 --> 22:24.291
Don't you have any
judges you can wake up?

22:24.393 --> 22:25.825
It might surprise you to learn

22:25.927 --> 22:28.962
I'm not very popular among
the federal judges.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.198
All right, so what do we do now?

22:32.301 --> 22:34.100
Now we wait.

22:35.937 --> 22:37.738
Just wait?

22:37.839 --> 22:39.473
Yeah.

22:40.457 --> 22:41.675
Great.

22:50.051 --> 22:54.187
You're not built for downtime, are you?

22:54.290 --> 22:56.456
The way you move, the way you pace,

22:56.558 --> 22:58.258
the way you want to
push through every wall

22:58.360 --> 23:01.027
without even looking for the
door or the key to that door.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.562
You have a point?

23:02.665 --> 23:04.097
That's not the temperament of a man

23:04.199 --> 23:05.865
who worked his way up
through law enforcement.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.434
Put my feet to the fire,

23:07.536 --> 23:10.470
I'd say you're more criminal than cop.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.840
You don't know me.

23:13.942 --> 23:15.975
I know you can't sit still.

23:16.077 --> 23:18.812
I'm guessing you were once made to

23:18.914 --> 23:22.015
for a very long time and
you didn't like it.

23:23.686 --> 23:26.186
You check the corners every
time you enter a room.

23:26.288 --> 23:28.689
That's not police training.
That's survival.

23:28.791 --> 23:32.826
Your demeanor towards me is complicated.

23:32.928 --> 23:36.196
You have trouble making eye contact.

23:36.298 --> 23:38.898
It's not lack of confidence.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.167
You've got a secret.

23:41.269 --> 23:43.670
Or secrets.

23:44.940 --> 23:47.240
Maybe I just don't like you.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.910
But you do.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.846
Don't you?

23:56.385 --> 23:58.918
You think you know me?

23:59.020 --> 24:02.389
Let me tell you something.
You have no fucking idea.

24:03.925 --> 24:06.526
Yeah, I check the corners because
for as long as I can remember,

24:06.628 --> 24:09.128
there's always been someone waiting
there to get the jump on me.

24:09.231 --> 24:11.030
And I don't stay still
'cause every time I do,

24:11.132 --> 24:13.533
someone close to me fucking dies!

24:21.443 --> 24:23.243
I'm sorry.

24:24.646 --> 24:27.080
No, you're not.

24:27.182 --> 24:30.149
No, I'm not.

25:38.219 --> 25:40.053
It's nothing.

26:03.846 --> 26:05.745
Hey.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.816
What is it?

26:13.689 --> 26:15.822
I'm sorry.

26:54.062 --> 26:56.963
There is a serial killer out there...

26:57.065 --> 26:59.399
- It's terrifying.
- I know, baby. I know.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.705
- I'll take patrol.
- It's my shift.

27:05.807 --> 27:08.008
No, I'm pulling rank. I've
got to get out of this zoo.

27:08.109 --> 27:09.306
Okay.

27:09.307 --> 27:10.611
BANSHEE COUNTY
SHERIFF DEPARTMENT

27:25.661 --> 27:27.827
Someone there?

27:53.488 --> 27:55.922
Shit.

28:13.041 --> 28:15.241
Burning the midnight oil, I see.

28:15.343 --> 28:17.644
This is not the place to
talk business, Calvin.

28:17.746 --> 28:20.480
That's fine because we no longer
have any business to discuss.

28:20.582 --> 28:23.382
The Brotherhood no longer works for you.

28:24.786 --> 28:28.688
- Is that so?
- Yes, that is so.

28:30.358 --> 28:32.826
Well, that's unfortunate.

28:32.928 --> 28:36.062
Not from where I'm sitting.

28:37.699 --> 28:41.034
I can't help but wonder what
Watts will think about this.

28:43.905 --> 28:46.305
Well, why don't we ask him?

28:50.612 --> 28:53.179
What do you think, Randall?

28:53.281 --> 28:56.116
Seems the cat got Watts's tongue.

28:56.217 --> 28:57.951
That's a bold choice.

28:58.053 --> 29:00.553
Yeah.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.822
I thought you'd like that.

29:10.298 --> 29:12.598
So here's how it's gonna work.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.333
Everything that's yours is now ours.

29:14.435 --> 29:18.271
Warehouses, shipments, buyers,
I fucking want all of it.

29:18.373 --> 29:21.240
You can go quietly or you can go bloody,

29:21.342 --> 29:23.109
but either way you are gone.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.519
You can keep the head as a souvenir.

30:02.851 --> 30:04.751
Hi.

30:04.853 --> 30:07.087
I saw you on TV.

30:07.189 --> 30:10.523
I didn't ask for this.

30:10.625 --> 30:12.558
He chose me.

30:12.660 --> 30:14.493
Do you understand?

30:14.596 --> 30:16.796
He chose me.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.298
You can't stop me.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.335
I've been delivered.

30:22.437 --> 30:25.205
To feed the beast,

30:25.306 --> 30:29.508
I've become something
different, something more.

30:29.611 --> 30:32.411
And you, you're a bug.

30:32.513 --> 30:35.982
A tiny, worthless insect
in the face of his power.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.951
Fuck you.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.621
Close your eyes, cop.

30:41.723 --> 30:43.589
Close your eyes.

30:43.691 --> 30:45.591
Cherish the darkness,

30:45.693 --> 30:48.561
for soon you will bear
witness to his plan.

30:48.663 --> 30:50.696
And only then

30:50.799 --> 30:54.934
will I take your miserable little life.

31:24.232 --> 31:25.198
Where are they, Kurt?

31:25.300 --> 31:27.700
Get the fuck off my property.

31:28.703 --> 31:30.403
Where's my wife?!

31:31.907 --> 31:33.173
She's somewhere safe.

31:33.275 --> 31:35.141
She'll call you when she's ready.

31:35.243 --> 31:38.778
You are fucking with my family, Kurt.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.281
My wife, my son.

31:41.382 --> 31:44.818
Do you have any idea what I will
fucking do to you for that?

31:46.054 --> 31:48.154
Where's Watts?

31:50.258 --> 31:52.292
Watts is dead.

31:52.393 --> 31:53.759
Where's Maggie?

31:53.862 --> 31:55.695
She doesn't want to see you.

31:55.797 --> 31:58.497
Fuck you. You don't get
to fucking tell me that.

31:58.599 --> 32:01.434
I just did. I'm going into my house.

32:01.536 --> 32:04.403
In two minutes, if you're still here,

32:04.505 --> 32:06.372
I'll come back out.

32:06.474 --> 32:11.010
Trust me, you don't want
me to come back out.

32:17.152 --> 32:18.718
Kurt.

32:22.590 --> 32:24.958
Do you remember Dad used to take us

32:25.060 --> 32:27.426
to the dogfights over in Vandergrift?

32:30.698 --> 32:31.664
Yeah.

32:31.766 --> 32:34.533
I remember I once asked him...

32:36.171 --> 32:38.872
if the matches ever ended in a tie.

32:41.243 --> 32:45.245
And he laughed at me

32:45.347 --> 32:47.847
and he said,

32:47.949 --> 32:51.384
"There's only ever one way
that a dogfight ends."

32:55.490 --> 32:57.456
You remember that?

33:02.364 --> 33:04.264
Yeah, I remember.

33:12.173 --> 33:14.507
There's only one way, Kurt.

33:20.282 --> 33:22.081
I know.

34:43.164 --> 34:45.398
Deva!

35:06.654 --> 35:08.454
- Are you hurt?
- No.

35:09.857 --> 35:11.891
Come on. Come on.

35:11.993 --> 35:13.526
Get out there. Get on the roof.

35:13.628 --> 35:15.495
- What?
- Go, go, go!

35:15.596 --> 35:17.763
Here, take this. Safety's off.

35:17.865 --> 35:20.633
Two hands. Point and squeeze.

35:20.735 --> 35:23.169
Find a place to hide, wait.
You stay safe.

35:24.243 --> 35:25.204
Go.

35:25.306 --> 35:27.373
Now!

38:01.563 --> 38:03.729
No.

39:01.522 --> 39:06.024
I am sick and tired...

39:06.127 --> 39:09.395
...of fighting for my
motherfucking life.

39:16.704 --> 39:17.670
Damn.

39:21.342 --> 39:22.375
Where's Deva?

39:27.782 --> 39:29.948
Deva.

39:31.018 --> 39:32.685
Are you hurt?

39:32.787 --> 39:35.388
Give me this.

39:39.026 --> 39:40.726
I'm sorry.

39:40.828 --> 39:43.663
I'm sorry.

39:50.438 --> 39:52.171
I'm sorry.

39:53.974 --> 39:55.474
I'm sorry.

40:11.726 --> 40:13.526
Deva.

40:15.823 --> 40:17.663
Slow down. Slow down.

40:37.752 --> 40:40.353
You okay? You hurt?

40:46.761 --> 40:48.126
Okay.

40:48.229 --> 40:50.195
I just want to go home.

40:52.467 --> 40:53.699
I know.

40:53.801 --> 40:56.535
The thing is, I don't
know where that is.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.706
Come here.

41:26.367 --> 41:28.267
Underwood, tell me you have something.

41:28.335 --> 41:29.935
The judge unsealed the file.

41:30.037 --> 41:32.805
The victim on that statutory
rape is a Kim Newton.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.440
She still lives in the area.

41:34.542 --> 41:36.942
- You got an address?
- Just emailed it to you.

41:37.044 --> 41:39.144
You're the best. I owe you.

41:39.246 --> 41:41.514
You owe me many.

41:43.350 --> 41:45.117
What is it with this fucking town?

41:45.219 --> 41:49.087
Can't we go one week without some
motherfucking army shooting at us?

41:49.189 --> 41:51.056
Seems like you handled it fine.

41:51.158 --> 41:54.493
That's because it's already
become a motherfucking habit.

41:57.264 --> 41:59.097
Thank you.

42:04.472 --> 42:07.072
Baby, there's a whole world out there.

42:07.174 --> 42:09.141
So they tell me.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.120
What the fuck happened here?

42:24.759 --> 42:25.991
Proctor.

42:26.093 --> 42:28.327
What are you doing messing with him?

42:28.429 --> 42:31.363
Are you kidding me?

42:31.466 --> 42:34.533
You don't get to walk into my life
every few years and question me.

42:34.635 --> 42:37.503
Hey, hey, Deva could have
been fucking killed.

42:38.606 --> 42:40.506
Get out of here.

42:40.608 --> 42:43.275
- Come on, Ana.
- Get the fuck out of here!

42:43.377 --> 42:45.143
Who the fuck do you think you
are saying that shit to me?!

42:45.245 --> 42:47.112
Do you think I don't know what
could have happened there?!

42:47.214 --> 42:48.681
You think I don't know what...

42:49.602 --> 42:51.550
Hey, hey, stop.

42:51.652 --> 42:54.052
It's okay.

42:54.154 --> 42:56.054
It's okay.

42:59.326 --> 43:01.126
It's okay.

43:01.228 --> 43:03.028
It's okay.

43:24.652 --> 43:26.952
Hello. Can I help you?

43:27.054 --> 43:28.854
Kim Newton?

43:28.956 --> 43:30.589
Yes.

43:31.759 --> 43:35.060
My parents were the ones
that called the police.

43:35.162 --> 43:38.497
I was 15, Declan, he was 25.

43:38.599 --> 43:41.600
I was a quiet girl.

43:41.702 --> 43:44.102
You know, I didn't have
many friends in school.

43:44.204 --> 43:46.338
Always the kid in the back row.

43:46.440 --> 43:49.608
Nobody really paid any attention to me.

43:49.710 --> 43:52.878
And then I met Declan.

43:52.980 --> 43:56.381
He told me I was beautiful and
I could tell he meant it.

43:56.483 --> 43:59.084
I had never even been kissed before

43:59.186 --> 44:02.287
and here was this handsome older guy

44:02.389 --> 44:04.023
falling head over heels in love with me.

44:04.124 --> 44:07.259
And I understand now that I
was young and impressionable

44:07.361 --> 44:11.263
and he manipulated me, but, you know...

44:12.900 --> 44:15.467
I still think he loved me

44:15.570 --> 44:18.437
and I know I loved him.

44:20.841 --> 44:22.041
So what happened?

44:22.142 --> 44:23.475
My dad found out.

44:23.578 --> 44:26.645
He wanted to go after
Declan with a tire iron,

44:26.747 --> 44:31.116
but my mother convinced him
to call the police instead.

44:32.186 --> 44:34.987
Oh, I cried for days.

44:36.991 --> 44:38.924
And the sex?

44:39.026 --> 44:42.194
Was it perverse in any way?

44:42.296 --> 44:45.064
It was intense, but, no,

44:45.165 --> 44:47.900
I wouldn't say it was perverse.

44:49.172 --> 44:51.637
Is Declan in some kind of trouble?

44:51.706 --> 44:53.205
He's a person of interest.

44:53.307 --> 44:57.109
When was the last time you spoke to him?

44:57.211 --> 44:58.811
The night he was arrested.

44:58.913 --> 45:02.147
After that, I never saw him again.

45:14.595 --> 45:16.662
It's a nice piece of property you have.

45:16.764 --> 45:20.298
Oh, thanks. My parents left it to me.

45:22.637 --> 45:24.603
Well, if you think of anything else,

45:24.705 --> 45:26.271
give me a call.

45:26.340 --> 45:28.206
- Thanks for your time.
- Yeah.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.738
Hey, it's Veronica.

45:59.840 --> 46:02.507
You disappeared on me this morning.

46:02.609 --> 46:06.444
But, anyway, I tracked down
our statutory rape victim.

46:06.547 --> 46:08.180
She said all the right things,

46:08.282 --> 46:10.716
but my bullshit meter is ringing.

46:10.818 --> 46:13.451
Anyway, I'm going back to the hotel,

46:13.554 --> 46:16.612
so call me and I'll fill you in on my...

46:38.612 --> 46:40.713
Oh, shit.

46:51.558 --> 46:54.292
I heard you were looking for me.
