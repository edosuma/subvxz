WEBVTT

00:00.139 --> 00:02.724
Previouly, on "Better Call Saul."

00:02.810 --> 00:05.310
I get my money, or neither
of us walk out of here.

00:05.395 --> 00:09.119
I say the word, my nephews pay
a visit to your granddaughter.

00:10.067 --> 00:12.877
I don't ever want to hear the
word "permit" again! Capiche?

00:12.903 --> 00:13.903
It's your funeral, dude!

00:13.987 --> 00:15.114
You're fired!

00:15.139 --> 00:16.238
I'll just pack up...

00:16.323 --> 00:18.217
Partners, you and me!

00:18.242 --> 00:19.101
What about clients?

00:19.126 --> 00:20.269
Mesa Verde.

00:20.294 --> 00:21.827
It'd be a hard sell to
take them with me.

00:21.912 --> 00:24.389
Separate firms under one roof.

00:24.414 --> 00:27.621
You... do things your way,
and I do them mine.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.229 --> 01:31.029
Ahead.

01:35.035 --> 01:37.485
Turn to the left.

02:50.227 --> 02:52.310
Step around the back of the truck.

04:10.807 --> 04:12.640
Okay.

04:21.651 --> 04:23.401
Here you go.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.150
You know, I was willing to take you

06:20.175 --> 06:22.141
to a more high-end establishment.

06:22.630 --> 06:24.514
This requires a proper celebration,

06:24.549 --> 06:26.349
so don't think that this counts.

06:26.384 --> 06:28.468
This is perfect.

06:29.332 --> 06:30.831
Besides...

06:31.950 --> 06:33.514
we're pinching pennies now.

06:33.816 --> 06:35.585
When we have a steady revenue stream,

06:35.610 --> 06:37.086
make the drive up
to Geronimo every night.

06:37.111 --> 06:39.217
- Till then...
- Yes. That.

06:39.242 --> 06:40.480
Let's make that happen.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.317
Okay, here's what ya gotta do.

06:44.369 --> 06:47.743
Type up your resignation letter now...

06:47.768 --> 06:49.136
- I mean, tonight.
- Tonight?

06:49.161 --> 06:50.284
Yeah.

06:50.309 --> 06:53.479
Well, I mean, finish
your hot dog first, but...

06:53.504 --> 06:56.546
Now, you put that letter
into Howard's office tonight.

06:56.581 --> 06:58.222
It's on his premises.

06:58.247 --> 06:59.499
You've officially given notice.

06:59.524 --> 07:00.504
Tomorrow morning,

07:00.529 --> 07:02.835
while he's still out on
the back nine chasin' his balls,

07:02.878 --> 07:05.204
you call Mesa Verde
and your other clients,

07:05.238 --> 07:06.172
you bring 'em along.

07:06.207 --> 07:07.473
You get to them before he does.

07:07.509 --> 07:09.137
- No.
- What? No.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.144
You gotta act now.

07:11.309 --> 07:13.442
Listen, you do this the "right way,"

07:13.467 --> 07:16.090
you wait, you tell Howard to his face,

07:16.115 --> 07:18.719
he'll sink his dirty hooks
into Mesa Verde

07:18.744 --> 07:20.987
before you get the words
"I quit" outta your mouth.

07:21.022 --> 07:23.360
Okay, Jimmy, I appreciate the advice,

07:23.385 --> 07:24.524
but the whole point of this

07:24.576 --> 07:27.160
is for you to be your kind
of lawyer and me to be mine.

07:27.195 --> 07:29.859
I need to find a way to do this
that's right for me.

07:51.345 --> 07:52.773
Hey, Kim. Can we make this quick?

07:52.798 --> 07:54.053
I'm kinda swamped right now.

07:54.089 --> 07:55.929
Uh, sure. Thanks for meeting with me.

07:55.954 --> 07:57.023
I only need a few minutes.

07:57.058 --> 07:59.258
Great. What's up?

08:00.278 --> 08:02.562
Howard, could we do this in your office?

08:03.325 --> 08:04.783
Please?

08:13.052 --> 08:15.374
- Again, thanks for taking the time.
- You can just...

08:15.410 --> 08:17.743
go ahead and rip off the Band-Aid.

08:17.796 --> 08:20.630
I have a pretty good idea
why you're here.

08:36.131 --> 08:38.397
So, you're going with
Schweikart and Cokely.

08:38.445 --> 08:40.443
- I'm sorry?
- I heard.

08:40.467 --> 08:42.001
Through the grapevine.

08:42.479 --> 08:44.570
I'm not going to another firm.

08:44.606 --> 08:46.239
I'm starting my own.

08:46.274 --> 08:49.108
I figured I'd try giving it a go
as a solo practitioner.

08:51.479 --> 08:53.830
Well.

08:53.865 --> 08:55.281
I, uh...

08:56.451 --> 08:58.417
Wow.

08:58.453 --> 09:01.921
I realized it was something
I needed to do.

09:01.956 --> 09:04.257
The week Jimmy exits Davis & Main,

09:04.292 --> 09:05.958
you decide to leave us?

09:06.010 --> 09:08.294
That can't just be happenstance.

09:10.131 --> 09:11.764
It's not.

09:11.799 --> 09:14.133
We're gonna be sharing expenses.

09:14.135 --> 09:17.073
One office, but two separate practices.

09:17.098 --> 09:20.373
Smart... on several counts.

09:21.262 --> 09:22.612
Howard...

09:23.863 --> 09:26.613
I want you to know
that I appreciate my time here.

09:27.315 --> 09:29.682
I'm grateful for everything you
and the firm have done for me,

09:29.717 --> 09:31.851
especially the financial help
with my schooling,

09:31.886 --> 09:34.153
and I'm ready to write a check
for the remainder of the loan.

09:34.189 --> 09:36.095
I just need accounting
to get me that figure.

09:36.120 --> 09:39.271
No need. Our gift to you.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.150
I don't know what to say.

09:44.175 --> 09:45.725
Um...

09:46.927 --> 09:48.167
thank you.

09:48.219 --> 09:49.388
You earned it.

09:51.222 --> 09:53.673
Tell you the truth, I'm kinda envious.

09:53.725 --> 09:55.174
Really? Why?

09:55.176 --> 09:57.343
Something about a fresh start.

09:58.513 --> 10:01.029
Back in the day,
right out of law school,

10:01.054 --> 10:03.149
I thought long and hard
about hanging up my own shingle.

10:03.184 --> 10:04.734
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:05.492 --> 10:09.063
Oh, I was ready to take on
the world, make a difference.

10:11.943 --> 10:13.910
Dad talked me out of it.

10:14.117 --> 10:16.701
Wanted me to join the ranks here,

10:16.726 --> 10:19.560
throw another "H" in the firm's logo.

10:23.755 --> 10:26.338
Things work out the way
they're supposed to, I guess.

10:32.714 --> 10:36.582
Kim, I want you to know
that I always pushed you harder

10:36.618 --> 10:39.552
because I knew that
I could expect more from you.

10:41.389 --> 10:42.888
Good luck to you.

10:45.756 --> 10:47.042
Thank you.

10:56.494 --> 10:59.646
Get me Kevin Wachtell at Mesa Verde.

10:59.674 --> 11:01.974
And cancel everything
I had lined up this morning.

11:02.010 --> 11:04.477
Calling now.

11:14.622 --> 11:16.305
Sorry.

11:16.341 --> 11:17.757
Excuse me.

11:17.809 --> 11:19.988
Hi, Paige. It's Kim.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.301
Yeah, hi.

11:21.326 --> 11:24.430
Just checking that we're still
on for lunch on Monday.

11:26.017 --> 11:28.818
Great. And Kevin, too?

11:28.853 --> 11:30.102
Good.

11:30.104 --> 11:31.437
Well, before we meet,

11:31.489 --> 11:33.823
there's some news
you need to know about.

13:54.481 --> 13:55.981
I am not the safe choice.

13:57.012 --> 13:59.059
The safe choice for you would be HHM.

13:59.653 --> 14:02.821
I believe, however, that I am...

14:02.823 --> 14:04.489
the right choice.

14:04.541 --> 14:06.558
Why?

14:06.593 --> 14:09.995
That suit you're wearing...
did you buy it off the rack?

14:10.030 --> 14:12.130
Please don't tell me it looks like I did.

14:12.166 --> 14:14.499
If it did, I wouldn't have asked.

14:14.551 --> 14:17.335
So why do you prefer a tailor-made suit?

14:19.556 --> 14:22.360
Because it fits you and you alone.

14:22.385 --> 14:25.143
Because each and every stitch
was fretted over

14:25.179 --> 14:26.761
with you in mind.

14:28.182 --> 14:30.982
Either you fit the jacket...

14:31.018 --> 14:33.401
or the jacket fits you.

14:35.956 --> 14:38.990
What if I want
a whole warehouse full of suits?

14:39.386 --> 14:41.619
That's a hell of a lot of sewing.

14:41.644 --> 14:44.346
How's one single tailor
gonna get that job done?

14:44.371 --> 14:45.664
I know your bank's needs

14:45.699 --> 14:48.200
in regard to this expansion
inside and out.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.558
Having Mesa Verde as my sole client

14:50.583 --> 14:54.249
will take up the entirety
of my attention, to be sure.

14:54.274 --> 14:56.153
But if this were beyond my abilities,

14:56.178 --> 14:58.577
I wouldn't be
throwing my hat in the ring.

14:58.612 --> 15:01.046
I would not waste your time.

15:02.049 --> 15:03.782
Or mine.

15:14.434 --> 15:17.082
Oh, hey, Kim! We're in here!

15:20.284 --> 15:22.067
Perfect timing.
I was just getting the tour.

15:22.119 --> 15:23.755
- Kim, this is Steve.
- Hi.

15:23.780 --> 15:24.863
Steve's the agent for the place.

15:24.888 --> 15:26.022
- Hi. Kim.
- Nice to meet ya.

15:26.047 --> 15:29.395
Hi, Kim. Everything okay?

15:30.256 --> 15:31.633
Ah, uh... wow.

15:32.506 --> 15:35.150
What do you think?

15:35.286 --> 15:36.669
I, uh...

15:38.295 --> 15:40.968
I think it's a...
it's a dentist's office.

15:40.993 --> 15:43.922
Two offices for two dentists,

15:43.924 --> 15:48.426
each the exact same size
with a mirrored layout.

15:48.428 --> 15:49.761
Here.

15:49.763 --> 15:52.258
The other one is the next door over,

15:52.283 --> 15:53.732
right beside this one.

15:53.767 --> 15:55.433
Right here.

15:55.435 --> 15:57.969
But they share one lobby,

15:57.994 --> 16:01.201
one reception area,
so egalitarian as hell.

16:01.226 --> 16:03.608
Not to mention efficient.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.076
Huh.

16:05.112 --> 16:07.178
Oh, also...

16:08.687 --> 16:09.928
soundproof walls,

16:09.953 --> 16:12.117
what with the drilling
and the pain and the whatnot.

16:12.169 --> 16:14.615
And the location, I mean, holy crap.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.117
I think this is the place.

16:21.954 --> 16:23.094
Kim?

16:24.220 --> 16:26.532
Yeah, it's great. Soundproofing.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.665
Hey, Steve, do you mind if we just...?

16:30.690 --> 16:31.470
Oh, please.

16:31.495 --> 16:33.228
I'll step outside
and make some phone calls.

16:33.253 --> 16:35.062
Y'all take all the time you need.

16:37.351 --> 16:38.693
Bad lunch, huh?

16:39.518 --> 16:41.284
Mesa Verde said no?

16:53.327 --> 16:56.181
Okay, I'm getting mixed signals here.

16:56.206 --> 16:57.775
I-is this a good...

16:57.800 --> 16:59.881
Jimmy, I got it.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.017
- You got Mesa Verde?
- Yes!

17:02.042 --> 17:03.978
I mean, there's nothing in writing yet,

17:04.002 --> 17:05.670
but the lunch went...

17:05.722 --> 17:07.986
It kicked ass.

17:08.011 --> 17:10.281
It was a little touch-and-go
there for a moment, I'll admit,

17:10.307 --> 17:13.311
but Paige pitched in,
and she really talked me up.

17:13.337 --> 17:15.012
And then once that door cracked open...

17:15.049 --> 17:17.844
High five. Fantastic.

17:17.868 --> 17:21.498
I-I had an for answer question,
every concern,

17:21.522 --> 17:23.679
and I did not bad-mouth HHM, not at all,

17:23.704 --> 17:26.597
but I was, like, enthusiasm, you know,

17:26.622 --> 17:29.454
and personal service, because
that's gotta count for something.

17:29.479 --> 17:32.030
- Shit, yeah, that counts!
- Exactly!

17:32.082 --> 17:34.916
I mean, 'cause, like, why were they
even at HHM in the first place?

17:34.951 --> 17:37.829
Me. So, uh... Oh, and then when
we walked out of the restaurant,

17:37.854 --> 17:40.517
when Kevin wasn't looking,
Paige gives me a thumbs-up.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.275
But not... not the regular thumbs-up.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.423
The double thumbs-up.

17:43.448 --> 17:44.916
- Two.
- Double barrel.

17:44.941 --> 17:46.432
Boom, boom. Just like that.

17:46.457 --> 17:47.426
I knew it.

17:47.451 --> 17:49.714
- I knew you could do it!
- It was just...

17:49.766 --> 17:53.051
God, it was perfect.

17:56.773 --> 17:58.556
What?

18:00.227 --> 18:03.595
I just... I love seeing you like this.

18:06.074 --> 18:07.754
So, are we gonna keep these chairs?

18:08.558 --> 18:11.207
Does that mean you like this office?

18:11.940 --> 18:13.206
Let's do it.

18:13.231 --> 18:15.206
Hell, yeah.

18:15.242 --> 18:17.096
Let's do it.

18:26.420 --> 18:29.304
Ernesto, the door's open...

18:29.339 --> 18:31.623
...as always.

18:32.959 --> 18:34.392
Ernesto?

18:35.210 --> 18:36.404
It's me, Chuck.

18:36.429 --> 18:38.963
Oh, hey, Howard, is Ernesto with you?

18:38.999 --> 18:40.498
No, it's just me.

18:40.523 --> 18:43.779
Well, I expected a round
of documents an hour ago.

18:43.804 --> 18:45.339
You know we've got a filing coming up.

18:45.364 --> 18:46.471
I know, Chuck.

18:46.506 --> 18:48.406
It's very possible...

18:48.725 --> 18:52.293
It's likely
that we're losing Mesa Verde.

18:52.412 --> 18:54.979
Losing them? We just got them.

18:56.277 --> 18:57.877
Well, why? Where are they going?

18:57.902 --> 18:59.994
They're going with Kim Wexler.

19:00.566 --> 19:02.454
She left the firm.

19:02.823 --> 19:04.332
Kim left?

19:06.042 --> 19:08.426
Oh, Howard.

19:09.613 --> 19:13.080
Well, where's she going?

19:13.105 --> 19:14.479
Is it Rich Schweikart?

19:14.737 --> 19:16.033
Or did Reeves and Green get her?

19:16.058 --> 19:17.135
Mnh. Not another firm.

19:17.187 --> 19:19.163
She's going into private practice.

19:19.188 --> 19:20.271
What?

19:20.307 --> 19:21.981
Well, that's completely...

19:24.003 --> 19:26.444
H-how is she going out on her own?

19:26.643 --> 19:28.643
Why is she going out on her own?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.454
Well, the why is the why.

19:30.479 --> 19:33.479
The how is that
she's pooling her resources...

19:34.488 --> 19:35.653
with Jimmy.

19:40.013 --> 19:43.865
Kim and my brother... partners at law?

19:45.748 --> 19:47.293
He's Svengali.

19:47.318 --> 19:49.033
The man is Svengali.

19:49.069 --> 19:51.536
At any rate, back to Mesa Verde.

19:51.571 --> 19:54.139
I'm gonna try one last Hail Mary.

19:54.752 --> 19:56.452
- Uh, Chuck?
- Hmm?

19:56.501 --> 19:58.398
- Mesa Verde.
- Yes, listening.

19:58.423 --> 19:59.952
I managed to get a meeting
with Kevin Wachtell.

19:59.977 --> 20:01.421
He's coming in this afternoon.

20:01.446 --> 20:04.048
But compliance law
is not my strong suit.

20:04.084 --> 20:07.085
So if you have any details,
any arguments,

20:07.120 --> 20:08.890
bullet-point them for me now,

20:08.915 --> 20:11.039
'cause I got about an hour
before I have to get back.

20:12.125 --> 20:13.491
Chuck?

20:14.496 --> 20:16.336
I really need your help here.

20:20.896 --> 20:22.200
Chuck?

20:27.374 --> 20:28.840
Are you okay?

20:29.611 --> 20:31.150
I'm going to that meeting.

20:31.197 --> 20:33.883
Chuck, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

20:33.908 --> 20:35.086
I can do it.

20:35.111 --> 20:36.399
Force of will.

20:36.424 --> 20:37.486
And I've been getting better.

20:37.511 --> 20:38.932
I know you have, but...

20:39.653 --> 20:41.753
the message that we want to send.

20:41.788 --> 20:43.221
I know the message...

20:43.256 --> 20:45.723
that we appear professional
and not crazy!

20:45.759 --> 20:48.626
I'm going to the meeting
and the lights stay on.

20:48.662 --> 20:50.836
Everyone keeps their phones.

20:50.861 --> 20:54.465
Everything stays, for lack
of a better word, normal.

20:56.336 --> 20:57.954
I will make it through.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.390
Hmm.

21:19.426 --> 21:21.391
Yeah?

21:23.313 --> 21:24.434
They're here.

21:24.459 --> 21:26.175
Okay.

21:52.420 --> 21:53.661
Hello, everyone.

21:53.686 --> 21:54.897
Sorry I was delayed.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.461
- Oh. Hi.
- No, no. Not at all. We just sat down.

21:56.463 --> 21:58.575
Kevin Wachtell, Paige Novick,
this is Charles McGill.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.387
Chuck.

21:59.412 --> 22:00.514
- Pleasure.
- Kevin. Paige.

22:00.539 --> 22:02.016
- Nice to meet you.
- Mm-hmm.

22:02.052 --> 22:03.825
Thank you both for coming.

22:03.850 --> 22:04.852
And don't worry.

22:04.888 --> 22:07.684
I'm not here
to extol the virtues of HHM.

22:07.709 --> 22:10.879
Mm. I'm guessing you've
already had to suffer through

22:10.904 --> 22:12.848
Howard's hard sell first time around,

22:12.873 --> 22:15.160
so you've done your time,

22:15.185 --> 22:16.199
as far as I'm concerned.

22:16.224 --> 22:18.543
What hard sell? It was enthusiasm.

22:18.568 --> 22:19.705
I gave them cookies.

22:19.730 --> 22:21.619
Cookies were good, as I recall.

22:21.655 --> 22:23.655
No, I'm here to put your minds at ease.

22:23.707 --> 22:28.159
Kim Wexler is, indeed, the right
choice to handle Mesa Verde.

22:28.211 --> 22:30.495
She's the obvious choice.

22:30.497 --> 22:34.797
She's young, she's brilliant,
she's going places.

22:35.763 --> 22:37.436
Let's face it, Howard.

22:37.895 --> 22:39.049
She's the future.

22:39.074 --> 22:41.839
Two old guys like us, we're the past.

22:41.841 --> 22:44.642
Well, that's a sad thought.

22:44.678 --> 22:46.385
Sad but true.

22:48.084 --> 22:51.619
Banking law... needs to be exciting.

22:52.119 --> 22:54.052
It needs the next generation
to come along

22:54.087 --> 22:56.587
and give it a big, old kick
in the seat of the pants.

22:56.623 --> 22:57.922
Really wake it up.

22:57.957 --> 23:00.325
Let me tell ya how boring I am.

23:00.360 --> 23:04.353
I read FEC and ISO reports
for entertainment.

23:04.378 --> 23:07.077
He does. I can attest to that.

23:07.102 --> 23:09.311
Well, I try to stay up on things.

23:09.336 --> 23:11.647
The rules are changing all the time.

23:11.672 --> 23:14.330
With everything that's happened
with Enron and WorldCom,

23:14.355 --> 23:16.189
the government is extra vigilant.

23:16.214 --> 23:19.177
These days, the penalties for
even the most honest of errors

23:19.212 --> 23:20.678
can be devastating.

23:20.714 --> 23:24.615
You need a sharp,
young eye to catch that stuff.

23:24.651 --> 23:28.086
I mean, when you've specialized
in this kind of work

23:28.121 --> 23:31.773
for decades on end,
you tend to get kinda...

23:32.526 --> 23:33.775
- Stale.
- Stale.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.970
You get stale.

23:34.995 --> 23:37.616
You forget about things like,
oh, I don't know,

23:37.641 --> 23:39.202
the Community Reinvestment Act.

23:39.227 --> 23:42.734
Any bank such as Mesa Verde
looking to open a de novo branch

23:42.736 --> 23:46.493
is definitely going to need
to show a healthy portfolio

23:46.518 --> 23:48.072
of CRA compliance.

23:48.124 --> 23:50.408
Duh. Obviously.

23:50.410 --> 23:52.910
You guys have all that covered,
I'm sure.

23:52.962 --> 23:56.336
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking
and Branching Efficiency Act...

23:56.361 --> 23:58.583
there's another mouthful, huh?

23:58.618 --> 23:59.852
Boring!

24:00.555 --> 24:02.225
Still, if you were to run afoul of it,

24:02.250 --> 24:04.264
it could hold you up in court for years.

24:04.289 --> 24:09.058
And by the way, uh, if that
were to happen to you folks

24:09.083 --> 24:11.763
as you go forward without us,
which it will not, um,

24:11.798 --> 24:15.691
Howard has contacts at the Fed
who could help sort things out.

24:15.716 --> 24:17.282
One or two. Mm-hmm.

24:17.307 --> 24:19.251
And then there's
the SEC's interpretation

24:19.276 --> 24:21.250
of Section 302 of Sarbox.

24:21.275 --> 24:22.930
Blah, blah, blah.

24:22.955 --> 24:24.915
Well, navigating that correctly

24:24.940 --> 24:27.814
could mean savings of several
hundred thousand dollars.

24:27.839 --> 24:28.853
They know that, Howard.

24:28.878 --> 24:29.822
Oh.

24:29.847 --> 24:30.978
I apologize.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.831
When you reach your golden years,

24:32.856 --> 24:34.919
you tend to get a little long-winded,

24:34.954 --> 24:36.954
ramble on and on about details.

24:36.956 --> 24:41.582
My point being,
your bank is in excellent hands.

24:48.885 --> 24:53.137
Look, I take your point. I do.

24:53.193 --> 24:54.326
But I have to say,

24:54.351 --> 24:57.108
I have complete confidence
in Ms. Wexler.

24:57.143 --> 24:58.309
You should.

24:58.361 --> 24:59.859
She was part of our team.

24:59.884 --> 25:01.467
She learned from us.

25:01.815 --> 25:04.315
You won't find better than Kim Wexler.

25:04.367 --> 25:07.935
But no matter how talented
one individual may be,

25:07.960 --> 25:10.822
the needs of Mesa Verde
are too big to handle alone.

25:10.824 --> 25:13.374
I wouldn't handle
your coming expansion alone.

25:13.409 --> 25:17.656
Which is why you should
consider, once again,

25:17.681 --> 25:20.748
enlisting a team of professionals.

25:23.254 --> 25:26.170
- Glad we did this.
- Any time.

25:26.172 --> 25:28.020
We are there for you day and night.

25:28.045 --> 25:29.336
Lovely to meet you, Paige.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.619
And you. Thank you.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.677
Talk soon, gentlemen.

25:37.497 --> 25:40.116
Chuck, that...

25:40.141 --> 25:43.020
That was amazing.

25:43.022 --> 25:44.330
You were fantastic.

25:44.355 --> 25:46.073
Trul... Whoa. Chuck?

25:46.752 --> 25:48.426
Get me home.

25:48.451 --> 25:49.827
Ernie!

25:49.863 --> 25:51.429
Hang on.

26:01.156 --> 26:02.469
Again, we want to thank you

26:02.494 --> 26:04.526
for accommodating the Major like this.

26:04.561 --> 26:06.228
You kidding? It's an honor.

26:06.263 --> 26:09.364
For a war hero, I think we can
bend the rules a wee bit.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.216
Well, we really appreciate it.

26:11.251 --> 26:14.279
Major Talbott's grandsons are
only in town for one more day,

26:14.304 --> 26:17.506
so it's great they get to share
this experience with him.

26:17.531 --> 26:19.725
You guys are in for a real treat.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.009
You excited?!

26:21.011 --> 26:22.844
- Uh-huh.
- Y-yeah, excited.

26:22.846 --> 26:24.646
So, these are your boys?

26:24.779 --> 26:27.413
No, I'm... No, I'm the family attorney.

26:27.438 --> 26:30.018
I just help when I can, so I called you.

26:30.020 --> 26:33.422
Well, I am glad to be of service.

26:33.457 --> 26:35.023
And here she is.

26:35.075 --> 26:36.692
Gentlemen, meet FIFI,

26:36.744 --> 26:40.555
the world's last
air-worthy B-29 Superfortress.

26:40.711 --> 26:43.487
She's based in Texas, but she's
here for a quick visit,

26:43.512 --> 26:45.667
just kind of a morale builder
for the airmen.

26:45.881 --> 26:47.597
The crew's on lunch, unfortunately.

26:47.622 --> 26:49.871
Otherwise, I was gonna see about
showing you the inside.

26:50.453 --> 26:52.253
Isn't she a beauty, Fudge?

26:52.278 --> 26:53.985
Just like the one you used to fly.

26:54.010 --> 26:55.385
- Fudge?
- Yep.

26:55.410 --> 26:57.877
Major Theodore "Fudge" Talbott.

26:57.902 --> 26:59.479
His mom used to mail him

26:59.510 --> 27:01.266
care packages of fudge during the war,

27:01.291 --> 27:02.718
and he shared them with his friends.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.269
So that's the story. Right, guys?

27:04.304 --> 27:04.974
- Yes.
- Yeah.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.199
Well, sir, this certainly must

27:06.224 --> 27:08.216
bring back some memories for you.

27:10.944 --> 27:13.027
"Too many to count," he says.

27:13.052 --> 27:15.224
I gotta say, Major Talbott...

27:15.899 --> 27:17.199
it's a privilege.

27:17.668 --> 27:19.168
So thank you for your service.

27:27.150 --> 27:29.450
He says, "You're welcome."

27:29.475 --> 27:33.977
Uh, um, boy, I envy you guys.

27:34.060 --> 27:35.271
I mean, the stories you must've heard.

27:35.296 --> 27:36.962
You remember any good ones?

27:37.029 --> 27:39.421
- Bombing stuff mostly.
- Bombing stuff.

27:39.423 --> 27:41.256
Um, like, um... Like, the war.

27:41.308 --> 27:43.725
Did he fly over the Hump,
or did he take off out of India?

27:45.145 --> 27:47.979
You doing okay? You need some water?

27:48.015 --> 27:49.913
Yes. Yes, sir.

27:49.938 --> 27:53.041
Oh, nuts. I forgot his water.

27:53.066 --> 27:55.595
Oh, hey. I can run back
to the office, get him a bottle.

27:55.620 --> 27:56.480
You could?

27:56.505 --> 27:59.274
Fudge, the captain's gonna
run back to his office,

27:59.326 --> 28:01.493
get you some water, okay, sir?

28:01.528 --> 28:02.828
All right. That's great.

28:02.863 --> 28:04.658
And there's no rush. He's gonna be fine.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.266
I'll be back ASAP.

28:11.756 --> 28:13.053
Up. Up.

28:13.193 --> 28:15.624
Thought I told you not to say anything.

28:15.626 --> 28:19.512
Go stand by the front,
uh, those nose, whatever.

28:19.537 --> 28:20.733
Where the hell'd you find this guy?

28:20.758 --> 28:22.130
You couldn't get a real war hero?

28:22.182 --> 28:24.631
Yeah, like they grow on trees.
So, this guy owes me.

28:24.656 --> 28:26.768
I defended him a while back
when he couldn't pay.

28:26.781 --> 28:27.686
Defended him for what?

28:27.711 --> 28:29.404
What? You wanna be a lawyer
when you grow up?

28:29.429 --> 28:30.608
Just fix the...

28:30.633 --> 28:32.474
Public masturbation.

28:32.526 --> 28:33.758
Total bullshit.

28:33.783 --> 28:35.992
All right, keep your voice down.

28:36.017 --> 28:37.946
You do not possess the power of speech.

28:37.981 --> 28:39.680
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

28:39.705 --> 28:40.532
Chop chop.

28:40.567 --> 28:42.221
All right, hands on hips.

28:42.246 --> 28:45.487
All right? Looking strong,
looking proud, all right?

28:45.489 --> 28:48.268
See the bomber, okay? The bomber's
the main point, so see it.

28:48.293 --> 28:49.458
I see the freaking bomber.

28:49.485 --> 28:51.254
Couldn't just plop the dude
in front of a flag?

28:51.279 --> 28:53.106
Why'd we have to come here?

28:53.131 --> 28:55.213
Production value. Showmanship.

28:55.249 --> 28:56.388
You rolling?

28:56.413 --> 28:57.179
- Yeah, rolling.
- Rolling.

28:57.204 --> 28:59.210
Okay, start the dolly.

28:59.820 --> 29:01.320
And action.

29:03.841 --> 29:06.007
You're part of the greatest generation.

29:06.059 --> 29:08.510
You fought the Nazis.

29:08.562 --> 29:10.916
Fought the Japanese.

29:10.941 --> 29:12.752
- What?
- Fought Japanese.

29:12.777 --> 29:14.694
I fought the Japanese.

29:14.719 --> 29:17.636
This machine was used in the Pacific,

29:17.661 --> 29:19.571
where the Japanese are.

29:19.793 --> 29:22.928
Why don't you shut up and learn
to take some direction?

29:24.744 --> 29:26.077
Japanese.

29:26.102 --> 29:27.726
All right, fine.

29:27.751 --> 29:31.630
You fought all the dirty... Axis powers.

29:31.655 --> 29:33.835
Your band of brothers came together,

29:33.871 --> 29:35.395
and you saved the world.

29:35.420 --> 29:36.919
You're heroic.

29:37.014 --> 29:38.160
Not that heroic.

29:38.185 --> 29:39.768
Just throw it away a little more.

29:40.210 --> 29:41.504
Okay, good.

29:41.529 --> 29:43.762
You've got red, white, and blue
coursing through your veins.

29:43.789 --> 29:44.632
Look up!

29:44.665 --> 29:46.765
Picture a bald eagle soaring!

29:46.800 --> 29:48.383
Shit.

29:48.435 --> 29:50.568
- What?
- Okay, just keep rolling.

29:50.593 --> 29:52.726
Tights, wides...
just get me some good angles.

29:52.751 --> 29:53.718
Okay. All right, back to one.

29:53.743 --> 29:55.554
- Back to one.
- Fudge.

29:55.579 --> 29:56.929
Fudge, right here. Fudge.

29:56.954 --> 29:57.913
- What is it, Ernie?
- Fudge.

29:57.938 --> 30:00.658
Jimmy, man, I'm at your
brother's, and he's bad.

30:00.781 --> 30:02.397
Bad? How bad?

30:02.449 --> 30:03.956
He's... I don't know. Bad, shakin'.

30:03.981 --> 30:05.233
I've never seen him like this.

30:05.285 --> 30:06.568
He keeps telling me
not to call a doctor.

30:06.593 --> 30:07.496
Lemme guess.

30:07.521 --> 30:08.895
He's been going into the office.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.481
Yeah, more and more.

30:10.522 --> 30:12.355
He had a big meeting there today.

30:12.492 --> 30:14.409
Okay, here's what you're gonna do.

30:14.461 --> 30:16.077
Wrap him in a space blanket.

30:16.129 --> 30:17.379
He's already under one.

30:17.414 --> 30:18.914
Wrap him in a second one.

30:18.916 --> 30:21.204
Make him some tea, or just, better,

30:21.229 --> 30:22.493
heat some chicken broth.

30:22.518 --> 30:23.813
Just let it simmer.

30:23.838 --> 30:24.811
Don't make it boil.

30:24.836 --> 30:26.600
That's it? No doctor?

30:26.625 --> 30:29.257
That's it. No doctor.
He's just gotta ride this out.

30:29.259 --> 30:31.259
Chuck'll be fine.

30:31.261 --> 30:33.202
Oh sh... I gotta go.

30:33.366 --> 30:35.536
Rhubarb. Rhubarb!

30:35.561 --> 30:36.874
Idiots, that's the signal.

30:36.899 --> 30:37.933
Get him in the chair.

30:37.958 --> 30:38.680
Okay.

30:38.705 --> 30:41.188
Where's the air hose?
Stick it in your nose.

30:42.322 --> 30:44.081
Come on.

30:47.465 --> 30:48.577
Sir!

30:48.612 --> 30:50.977
Hey, this is not a problem.

30:51.002 --> 30:53.703
Would you mind if the guys and I
took a picture with you?

30:53.728 --> 30:55.047
It would mean a lot to us.

30:55.072 --> 30:57.375
Yeah, uh, p-pictures. He loves pictures.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.225
Here. Give me the camera.

30:58.250 --> 30:59.140
- I'll take it.
- Here's your water.

30:59.165 --> 31:00.476
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you so much.

31:00.501 --> 31:02.233
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Ooh, here.

31:02.258 --> 31:05.460
All right, let's scoot ya in.

31:05.512 --> 31:06.586
Swing ya around.

31:06.611 --> 31:08.899
Okay, everybody line up?

31:10.801 --> 31:12.267
Smile.

31:12.302 --> 31:13.852
Cheese.

31:37.681 --> 31:41.329
You ready to sign? Let's do this.

31:42.820 --> 31:44.569
What?

31:47.921 --> 31:50.078
I lost Mesa Verde.

31:50.828 --> 31:53.839
- What?
- I had him.

31:55.567 --> 31:57.200
I thought I had him.

31:57.431 --> 31:59.514
So what happened?

32:00.049 --> 32:02.349
They're s-sticking with HHM.

32:03.124 --> 32:04.686
Paige said they went over there
this afternoon

32:04.711 --> 32:07.848
for some kind of... courtesy meeting,

32:07.873 --> 32:11.076
or so she thought,
and Kevin got his head turned.

32:11.466 --> 32:13.763
- By Howard?
- No.

32:15.618 --> 32:16.759
Chuck.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.727
Jimmy, I have to ask.

32:34.601 --> 32:36.885
You still up for doing this?

32:37.445 --> 32:40.112
What? You mean getting the office?

32:41.082 --> 32:42.381
All of it.

32:43.425 --> 32:46.425
I think maybe we need to...

32:47.268 --> 32:49.188
slow down and really, you know...

32:50.741 --> 32:52.467
- think about this.
- Wait. Whoa.

32:52.502 --> 32:54.402
- Nothing's changed.
- N-nothing's changed?

32:54.454 --> 32:56.571
We're about to sign
a very expensive lease

32:56.573 --> 32:58.486
after a very sizable chunk of income

32:58.511 --> 33:00.730
just went flying out the window.

33:00.755 --> 33:02.441
That's why we're a team.

33:03.364 --> 33:05.230
Something like this happens...

33:05.255 --> 33:08.416
you're there to help me,
I'm there to help you.

33:08.418 --> 33:09.801
Hey.

33:09.836 --> 33:13.254
There will be other Mesa Verdes.

33:16.426 --> 33:19.961
So you still wanna do this?

36:28.618 --> 36:30.418
Jimmy...

36:30.569 --> 36:32.004
I did everything you said,

36:32.029 --> 36:33.613
but he's not getting any better.

36:33.638 --> 36:34.863
You did good, Ernie.

36:34.888 --> 36:36.124
Thanks.

36:36.176 --> 36:38.259
Why don't you, uh,
go home and get some sleep?

36:38.295 --> 36:39.627
I'll take over.

36:39.679 --> 36:42.597
He told me he wanted me to stay.

36:42.632 --> 36:44.933
It's okay. I'm here now.

36:44.968 --> 36:47.406
And, uh, next time you see Howard,

36:47.431 --> 36:49.687
tell him you need a raise... a big one.

36:56.863 --> 36:59.647
Chuck, buddy?

36:59.649 --> 37:01.899
How you feeling?

38:26.453 --> 38:28.053
Hey, how's it going?

38:28.055 --> 38:31.056
I need an X-ACTO knife,
a ruler... wood, please...

38:31.058 --> 38:34.059
Hammermill Premium paper...
20 pound, one ream...

38:34.111 --> 38:35.204
and a glue stick.

38:35.229 --> 38:37.444
Oh, and point me to your best copier.

38:37.469 --> 38:39.197
- Best copier?
- Yeah. Best copier.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.866
C'mon. Di di mau.

42:19.402 --> 42:21.402
He emerges.

42:21.427 --> 42:23.056
Good afternoon.

42:25.134 --> 42:26.709
Is it afternoon?

42:29.439 --> 42:30.721
Where's Ernesto?

42:30.746 --> 42:32.613
He was supposed to stay with me.

42:32.638 --> 42:34.099
Don't get mad at Ernie.

42:34.101 --> 42:35.767
He spent the better part of a day

42:35.769 --> 42:38.103
watching you do your impression
of a baked potato.

42:38.155 --> 42:41.122
I told him to go home,
get some shut eye.

42:41.692 --> 42:43.775
You hungry?

42:43.827 --> 42:45.942
You want something besides crackers?

42:46.682 --> 42:48.233
No, I'm fine.

42:53.787 --> 42:58.506
I'll fix myself something
after my stomach settles.

42:58.542 --> 43:01.343
Really doing a number on yourself,

43:01.378 --> 43:04.462
spending so much time out of the house.

43:04.910 --> 43:06.827
You just had to do it, huh?

43:07.463 --> 43:09.711
Couldn't stand
to let Kim have Mesa Verde.

43:09.736 --> 43:11.102
You had to swipe it from her.

43:11.138 --> 43:12.637
I didn't swipe anything.

43:12.639 --> 43:14.022
We retained our client.

43:14.057 --> 43:16.641
You and Howard never even
heard about Mesa Verde

43:16.693 --> 43:20.018
till Kim brought it to ya
on a red velvet pillow.

43:24.651 --> 43:28.041
I need a shower, and I've got
a ton of work to do.

43:28.066 --> 43:30.455
So if you're lookin' for a fight, Jimmy,

43:30.480 --> 43:32.886
I just don't have it in me.

43:38.665 --> 43:40.534
Jimmy.

43:42.138 --> 43:43.815
Thanks for stayin' with me.

43:45.839 --> 43:51.142
I know we have our issues,
but if things were reversed,

43:52.358 --> 43:54.866
I...I hope you know that
I would do the same for you.

44:22.010 --> 44:24.016
You're doing a great job.

44:24.041 --> 44:25.766
You done this before?

44:25.791 --> 44:28.344
No, not like this,

44:28.369 --> 44:31.433
but we learned about fractions
in school.

44:31.468 --> 44:33.935
You did? What fractions?

44:33.970 --> 44:39.143
1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, 1/8 inch, 1/16 inch.

44:39.168 --> 44:41.059
Hmm. Wow.

44:41.111 --> 44:42.714
You know, I gotta tell ya,

44:42.739 --> 44:46.064
you are much smarter than I was
when I was your age.

44:46.116 --> 44:49.378
Maybe you needed better teachers.

44:50.089 --> 44:51.688
That could be.

44:51.876 --> 44:53.735
Can I do the drill now?

44:53.760 --> 44:56.165
- You promised.
- Oh.

44:57.298 --> 44:59.993
I did, didn't I? Huh?

45:00.526 --> 45:02.182
Okay, get up here.

45:04.134 --> 45:05.807
Now, you're gonna have to wear these

45:05.832 --> 45:07.642
if you're gonna handle
the heavy machinery.

45:07.667 --> 45:10.305
W-why don't you have to wear them?

45:10.340 --> 45:14.092
Because Pop-Pop's a grown-up,
and grown-ups get to be stupid.

45:14.144 --> 45:15.991
Now, put them on.

45:16.365 --> 45:17.444
All right.

45:17.469 --> 45:21.046
Now, I'm gonna hold this
because it's heavy,

45:21.183 --> 45:23.949
but you pull the trigger
when I say so, okay?

45:23.974 --> 45:25.653
Now get your hand on it.

45:25.689 --> 45:27.605
All right, you got it?

45:27.607 --> 45:28.940
Ready.

45:28.942 --> 45:32.888
All right, ready... set... pull.

45:36.271 --> 45:37.449
Good job.

45:37.474 --> 45:39.343
- Can we do more?
- Mm-hmm.

45:39.368 --> 45:40.772
You line them up for me.

45:41.838 --> 45:43.121
Hello?!

45:43.173 --> 45:45.351
We're back here.

45:48.879 --> 45:51.436
Wow. What's all this?

45:51.461 --> 45:53.443
We're making a special hose.

45:53.468 --> 45:56.677
Yeah, that's a special hose, all right.

45:56.702 --> 45:58.871
I made marks every 3/4 inch,

45:58.896 --> 46:00.888
then Pop-Pop put a piece of wood down

46:00.913 --> 46:02.746
so he doesn't ruin his table.

46:02.771 --> 46:05.777
Then we line up a drill,
put the hole on the "X."

46:05.812 --> 46:08.285
Huh. Wow.

46:08.480 --> 46:11.950
I needed a soaker
for the rhododendrons out back.

46:12.749 --> 46:15.514
Well, Pop-Pop's gonna have to
finish his project on his own,

46:15.539 --> 46:16.444
because we have to go.

46:16.469 --> 46:18.405
But we're not done yet.

46:18.430 --> 46:20.158
No, I'll finish up.

46:20.210 --> 46:23.784
But you, young lady, were a big help.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.526
Give me a hug.

46:26.666 --> 46:29.000
Ooh.

46:29.002 --> 46:30.503
Love you, girl.

46:31.671 --> 46:33.991
- Love you.
- Thanks, Mike.

46:34.016 --> 46:35.452
Oh, you still good for Friday?

46:35.477 --> 46:36.444
Absolutely.

46:36.469 --> 46:38.026
I'll think of another project by then.

46:38.051 --> 46:40.159
Fantastic. Bye.

46:40.184 --> 46:41.416
Bye.

47:14.059 --> 47:15.564
I have a lunch date already.

47:15.589 --> 47:17.209
- Well, break it.
- I cannot break it.

47:17.234 --> 47:18.439
Will you take your hands off me?

47:18.464 --> 47:20.595
- Why are you playing, osteopath?
- Temper, temper.

47:20.788 --> 47:23.652
Oh, listen, Walter,
you are no longer my husband

47:23.677 --> 47:25.223
and no longer my boss.

47:25.225 --> 47:27.191
And you're not gonna be my boss.

47:27.227 --> 47:29.944
Well, it would've worked out
if you'd been satisfied

47:29.980 --> 47:32.218
with just being editor
and reporter, but not you.

47:32.243 --> 47:33.835
You had to marry me, spoil everything.

47:33.860 --> 47:37.147
I wasn't satisfied?
I suppose I proposed to you.

47:37.172 --> 47:38.882
Well, you practically did,
making goo-goo eyes at me

47:38.907 --> 47:41.579
for two years until
I broke down. "Oh, Walter."

47:41.604 --> 47:44.075
And I still claim I was tight
the night I proposed to ya.

47:44.077 --> 47:46.007
If you'd have been a gentlemen, you'd
have forgotten all about it, but not you.

47:46.032 --> 47:47.477
- Why, you!
- Oh, oh. Ah, ah.

47:47.502 --> 47:48.251
You're losing your eye.

47:48.275 --> 47:49.586
You used to be able to
pitch better than that.

47:49.634 --> 47:53.826
Hello? Yeah. What? Sweeney?
Well, what can I do for ya?
