WEBVTT

00:02.264 --> 00:05.133
And here's another
interesting weather fact.

00:05.135 --> 00:07.802
Another? Great!

00:07.804 --> 00:11.172
Changes in jet streams
can affect the speed

00:11.174 --> 00:13.474
at which the Earth
rotates on its axis,

00:13.476 --> 00:16.844
so bad weather can actually
make the day longer.

00:16.846 --> 00:19.714
Well, there must be a hell
of a storm somewhere.

00:21.550 --> 00:23.618
Joke if you must,

00:23.620 --> 00:25.720
but you're going to
miss these moments.

00:25.722 --> 00:27.488
With Leonard home
in a few days,

00:27.490 --> 00:30.691
this was your last time driving
me to the grocery store.

00:30.693 --> 00:32.659
You know,
I will miss this.

00:32.662 --> 00:35.797
I'll tell you what,
if my apples are mealy,

00:35.799 --> 00:40.134
we'll hit the produce section
for one last crazy blowout.

00:40.136 --> 00:42.336
Heck, you can even
push the cart.

00:42.338 --> 00:46.674
Please don't take my looking
forward to Leonard's return

00:46.676 --> 00:50.011
as criticism of the job you've
been doing in his absence.

00:50.013 --> 00:51.479
I won't.

00:52.548 --> 00:56.184
That criticism will come later
in your report card.

00:56.186 --> 00:58.319
Yeah, I didn't stay
for the detention,

00:58.321 --> 01:00.388
I'm not gonna read
the report card.

01:03.792 --> 01:04.759
Hello.

01:04.760 --> 01:05.893
(screams)
Leonard!

01:05.895 --> 01:07.228
Shh, shh.
Hi!

01:07.230 --> 01:08.629
Keep your voice down.
Oh, my God.

01:08.631 --> 01:09.931
You weren't supposed
to be here till Sunday!

01:09.933 --> 01:11.165
We finished
the experiment early,

01:11.167 --> 01:12.867
so I thought I'd come home
and surprise you.

01:12.869 --> 01:14.368
Oh, my gosh, why
are we whispering?

01:14.370 --> 01:15.269
I didn't tell Sheldon,

01:15.271 --> 01:16.971
so we could have
a few days alone.

01:16.973 --> 01:18.906
Oh, that is
so romantic.

01:18.908 --> 01:21.142
Uh, sure,
that's why I did it.

01:22.111 --> 01:25.646
Oh... I just cannot
believe you're here.

01:25.648 --> 01:27.081
SHELDON: Penny, it's
your lucky day!

01:27.083 --> 01:29.117
Three of the eggs are
clearly not jumbo.

01:29.119 --> 01:30.485
Grab your keys.

02:01.196 --> 02:03.765
Uh, Stuart,
I was wondering

02:03.767 --> 02:05.566
if you could help me
find something.

02:05.568 --> 02:08.603
Happy to, unless it's hope
or a reason to live.

02:09.437 --> 02:12.840
Oh, you make me laugh,
sad clown.

02:14.310 --> 02:15.276
Anyhoo...

02:15.278 --> 02:17.779
Leonard will be back
in a couple days

02:17.781 --> 02:20.081
and I need a welcome-home
gift for him.

02:20.083 --> 02:22.617
As he's been at sea,
perhaps something

02:22.619 --> 02:25.219
with a nautical theme
might be appropriate.

02:25.221 --> 02:28.056
Okay, well, I don't know
how much you want to spend,

02:28.058 --> 02:31.459
but I do have this pretty
cool Aquaman statue.

02:35.264 --> 02:37.065
Aquaman?

02:37.067 --> 02:39.634
Oh, this isn't
a gag gift, Stuart.

02:40.469 --> 02:41.869
Yeah, just as well.

02:41.871 --> 02:43.504
It's a pretty
rare piece.

02:43.506 --> 02:45.940
I'd rather just sell it
to a real collector.

02:45.942 --> 02:48.476
I'm a real collector.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.479
How rare is it?

02:51.481 --> 02:52.980
Oh, I shouldn't even
have mentioned it.

02:52.982 --> 02:55.650
How about a Batman
squirt gun?

02:55.652 --> 02:57.352
Don't try and trick me

02:57.354 --> 02:59.487
into buying something
I don't want.

02:59.489 --> 03:01.622
Now let's talk Aquaman.

03:02.758 --> 03:05.860
What were they thinking,
putting Doctor Octopus's mind

03:05.862 --> 03:07.562
in Spider-Man's body?

03:07.564 --> 03:09.564
Well, I've been
quite enjoying that.

03:09.566 --> 03:11.866
It combines all the
superhero fun of Spider-Man

03:11.868 --> 03:15.002
with all the body-switching
shenanigans of <i>Freaky Friday.</i>

03:15.804 --> 03:18.773
Both versions:
original and Lohan.

03:18.775 --> 03:21.209
(imitating Koothrappali):
"Both versions: original and Lohan."

03:21.211 --> 03:22.343
You're an idiot.

03:22.345 --> 03:24.545
Hey, what's your problem?

03:24.547 --> 03:26.814
I'm sorry, I've been
kind of snippy lately.

03:26.816 --> 03:29.150
It's probably this
stupid diet I'm on.

03:29.152 --> 03:30.184
Why are you on a diet?

03:30.186 --> 03:32.320
I've put on
a couple pounds.

03:33.355 --> 03:35.757
Had to buy these pants
in the men's section.

03:37.993 --> 03:40.294
Well, we've all
seen your mom.

03:41.697 --> 03:42.864
That Butterball turkey

03:42.866 --> 03:44.999
was bound to come
home to roost.

03:46.335 --> 03:49.036
$1,200!
That's my final offer!

03:50.305 --> 03:52.273
All right, Sheldon,
you win.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.442
I'm sure Leonard
is gonna love this.

03:54.444 --> 03:57.311
Oh, right,
a present for Leonard.

03:58.313 --> 04:00.815
You better throw in
that squirt gun.

04:00.817 --> 04:02.417
Yeah, I don't know.

04:02.419 --> 04:05.453
This squirt gun, it's,
uh, it's pretty rare.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.856
Ooh.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.661
And this is me doing
the <i>Titanic</i> pose on the boat.

04:13.663 --> 04:15.663
Ah.

04:15.665 --> 04:16.863
And... oh.

04:16.866 --> 04:18.766
That's me getting rescued
after I fell in.

04:18.767 --> 04:20.267
Oh.

04:20.269 --> 04:21.636
(knocking)

04:21.637 --> 04:22.537
Oh, that's the pizza.

04:22.539 --> 04:23.638
Yep.
(clears throat)

04:23.640 --> 04:25.373
Here's some money.
Thank you.

04:25.375 --> 04:26.641
And I'm gonna hit the head.

04:26.643 --> 04:28.443
That's what us
salty sea dogs say

04:28.445 --> 04:30.144
when we have to go pee-pee.

04:32.514 --> 04:34.282
Hey.
$22.50.

04:34.284 --> 04:36.217
Okay, here's, uh, $25.
Keep the change.

04:36.219 --> 04:37.418
Seriously?

04:37.420 --> 04:40.087
I just walked up, like,
four flights of stairs.

04:40.089 --> 04:41.088
Oh.

04:41.090 --> 04:42.623
Okay.

04:42.625 --> 04:44.192
Well, here's, um...

04:44.194 --> 04:46.327
30-something cents

04:46.329 --> 04:48.396
and a promise
I won't call your boss

04:48.398 --> 04:51.232
and tell him
you reek of marijuana.

04:52.768 --> 04:55.236
Oh, Penny, I see
you've ordered pizza.

04:55.238 --> 04:56.838
I have Chinese food.

04:56.840 --> 04:57.872
That's nice.

04:57.874 --> 05:01.509
Oh, that's
a rather earthy cologne.

05:03.445 --> 05:06.180
My uncle used
to wear that.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.083
Perhaps we can enjoy
one last meal together

05:09.085 --> 05:10.852
before Leonard returns.
Yeah, thanks,

05:10.854 --> 05:12.520
but I kind of feel like
eating alone tonight, so...

05:12.522 --> 05:13.721
Are you sure?

05:13.723 --> 05:16.390
With your Italian pizza
and my Chinese noodles,

05:16.392 --> 05:17.925
we could play Marco Polo.

05:17.927 --> 05:20.928
I mean, of course, a
reenactment of a meal

05:20.930 --> 05:23.297
in the life of Marco Polo
the Venetian explorer,

05:23.299 --> 05:26.901
not Marco Polo the
terrifying water sport.

05:26.903 --> 05:29.871
Uh, yeah, it sounds fun,
but no thanks.

05:29.873 --> 05:31.305
(toilet flushes)
Have a good night!

05:31.307 --> 05:33.174
What, now...
do you have company?

05:33.176 --> 05:34.909
No. No, no, no.

05:34.911 --> 05:36.577
You know what?
Th-The toilet's been doing that.

05:36.579 --> 05:38.012
I called
the building manager, so...

05:38.014 --> 05:40.147
Oh, I can take a look at it.
Well...

05:40.149 --> 05:41.415
I'm quite familiar
with plumbing.

05:41.417 --> 05:42.717
Not to brag,

05:42.719 --> 05:46.053
but I spent most of fifth grade
with my head in a toilet.

05:46.055 --> 05:47.555
Yeah, no, no, no.

05:47.557 --> 05:49.056
You know what,
Sheldon, it's okay.

05:49.058 --> 05:50.825
You don't have to go
into the bathroom.

05:50.827 --> 05:52.326
That's curious.

05:52.328 --> 05:53.661
If there's no one here,

05:53.663 --> 05:56.931
why are there two glasses
of wine on the table?

05:56.933 --> 05:58.432
Oh.

05:58.434 --> 06:00.301
Well, you know,
I-I've got two hands

06:00.303 --> 06:02.570
and a bit of a drinking problem.

06:02.572 --> 06:04.005
Of course.

06:04.007 --> 06:05.172
Ask a silly question.

06:05.174 --> 06:06.107
Oh. (chuckles)

06:06.975 --> 06:08.809
That's odd.

06:08.811 --> 06:09.610
Um, what?

06:09.612 --> 06:10.845
There are takeout containers

06:10.847 --> 06:12.113
in the trash can.

06:12.115 --> 06:14.649
So? That's my dinner
from last night.

06:14.651 --> 06:17.752
What's odd is
they're in the trash can.

06:17.754 --> 06:19.120
Okay.

06:19.122 --> 06:20.321
Look, honey,
I promise there's no one's here.

06:20.323 --> 06:21.455
I've had a long day.

06:21.457 --> 06:22.990
I just want to have
a quiet dinner by myself.

06:22.992 --> 06:25.426
Oh, very well.

06:25.428 --> 06:28.863
I'm no stranger to enjoying
the pleasures of solitude.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.233
Oh!
What?

06:32.235 --> 06:34.135
Have you gotten Leonard
a welcome-home gift yet?

06:34.137 --> 06:35.269
No.
Oh, great.

06:35.271 --> 06:36.737
Do you want
to go halfsies

06:36.739 --> 06:38.472
on a $200 squirt gun?

06:41.743 --> 06:42.643
Hi, honey.

06:42.645 --> 06:43.644
Hey.

06:43.646 --> 06:45.446
I made some brownies.
You want one?

06:46.315 --> 06:48.149
You're kidding, right?

06:49.084 --> 06:50.284
I mean, you know

06:50.286 --> 06:52.119
I'm trying to lose weight.

06:52.121 --> 06:55.756
God, I thought we were partners
in this marriage.

06:55.758 --> 06:57.391
We are. Stop it.

06:57.393 --> 06:59.226
And for the last time,
you're not fat.

06:59.228 --> 07:01.329
Really? Tell that
to the bathroom scale,

07:01.331 --> 07:03.664
'cause one of you is lying.

07:03.666 --> 07:06.000
Fine, forget I asked.

07:06.002 --> 07:08.169
How was dinner
at your mom's?

07:08.171 --> 07:09.236
Awful.

07:09.238 --> 07:11.706
I had to rub her ointment
all over her again.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.274
Why can't she do it?

07:13.276 --> 07:16.544
'Cause we've got a deeply
unhealthy relationship.

07:17.579 --> 07:19.046
Which reminds me,

07:19.048 --> 07:21.382
do you think you can get
any samples of this from work?

07:21.384 --> 07:23.017
This was supposed
to last her a month,

07:23.019 --> 07:24.251
but they didn't take
into account

07:24.253 --> 07:26.220
the square footage of her back.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.625
Let me see.

07:30.627 --> 07:32.326
How long have you been
putting this on her?

07:32.328 --> 07:33.494
I don't know.

07:33.496 --> 07:34.462
Few weeks. Why?

07:34.464 --> 07:37.264
This is really strong
estrogen cream.

07:37.266 --> 07:39.066
Please tell me
you've been wearing gloves.

07:39.068 --> 07:41.802
Like these swollen sausages
could fit in gloves.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.773
Howie, the estrogen's getting
absorbed by your skin.

07:45.775 --> 07:47.141
That's why you've been

07:47.143 --> 07:51.112
all bloated and moody
and a giant pain in the ass.

07:51.114 --> 07:54.482
You're full of estrogen
and you don't act like that.

07:54.484 --> 07:55.750
That's 'cause I'm a woman.

07:55.752 --> 07:59.353
I've had years of practice
riding the dragon.

08:00.722 --> 08:01.956
Fine.

08:01.958 --> 08:03.391
I'll wear gloves next time.

08:03.393 --> 08:04.892
It's still gonna take
a few weeks

08:04.894 --> 08:06.494
for the hormones
to leave your system.

08:06.496 --> 08:08.963
I feel so stupid.

08:08.965 --> 08:11.732
And fat.

08:11.734 --> 08:13.134
It's okay.

08:13.136 --> 08:15.202
You still look
great to me.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.271
In fact, why don't
we go in the bedroom

08:17.273 --> 08:19.306
and I'll prove
it to you?

08:19.308 --> 08:20.675
Sex? Really?

08:20.677 --> 08:23.077
I mean, that's just
your solution to everything!

08:25.447 --> 08:27.014
Oh, and here's
a fun thing.

08:27.016 --> 08:28.949
I worked it out
so that there are

08:28.951 --> 08:30.384
two different
words for spoon:

08:30.386 --> 08:32.986
"planko" and "janko."

08:32.989 --> 08:35.322
"Planko" is a spoon
with food,

08:35.323 --> 08:37.323
"janko" is a spoon
without food.

08:39.094 --> 08:41.227
"Janko" is spelled
with a silent "ptang."

08:43.298 --> 08:45.266
Sheldon, you're
not even listening

08:45.268 --> 08:47.635
to the rules of my
made-up language.

08:47.637 --> 08:49.036
Yes, I am.

08:49.038 --> 08:50.905
Then what does
"tweepadock" mean?

08:50.907 --> 08:52.606
Uh...

08:52.608 --> 08:53.974
elephant?

08:53.976 --> 08:56.243
Lucky guess.

08:58.847 --> 09:00.081
I'm sorry.

09:00.083 --> 09:01.749
I'm just distracted
by something

09:01.751 --> 09:03.250
that happened over at Penny's.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.385
What happened?

09:04.387 --> 09:07.288
I fear Penny is being
unfaithful to Leonard.

09:07.290 --> 09:08.355
What?

09:08.357 --> 09:10.291
She claimed to be alone

09:10.293 --> 09:13.294
when there was obviously
someone else in her apartment.

09:13.296 --> 09:15.796
I have no choice but
to assume the worst,

09:15.798 --> 09:18.232
given Leonard's
lengthy sea voyage

09:18.234 --> 09:21.602
and her famously
ravenous nether regions.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.605
I don't think Penny
would cheat on Leonard.

09:24.607 --> 09:25.840
Oh, really?

09:25.842 --> 09:27.208
(chuckles)

09:28.643 --> 09:31.445
She and I once had
a staring contest.

09:31.447 --> 09:34.482
She clapped really loud
and made me blink.

09:35.684 --> 09:38.953
It's a small leap from
there to sexual infidelity.

09:40.856 --> 09:42.890
You're being ridiculous.

09:42.892 --> 09:45.426
Amy, there were Chinese
food containers...

09:45.428 --> 09:47.661
in the trash can.

09:49.498 --> 09:51.198
Poor Leonard.

09:56.938 --> 09:58.439
Do you hear anything?

09:58.441 --> 10:00.441
I hear a woman's voice.

10:00.443 --> 10:01.675
Is it Penny?

10:01.677 --> 10:03.344
No, it's you.

10:05.914 --> 10:08.516
All right,
I hear whispering and giggling.

10:08.518 --> 10:10.017
Now I think
I hear kissing.

10:10.019 --> 10:12.987
Yeah, like you know
what kissing sounds like.

10:12.989 --> 10:16.524
There's kissing
in <i>Star Trek,</i> smarty-pants.

10:16.526 --> 10:18.359
Let me listen.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.196
(whispering):
Sounds like Leonard.

10:22.198 --> 10:23.531
Please.

10:23.533 --> 10:25.566
Why would Leonard
come home early

10:25.568 --> 10:27.568
and waste his time kissing Penny

10:27.570 --> 10:30.771
when he could be hanging out
with his best buddy?

10:31.973 --> 10:33.374
Yeah, that's it.

10:33.376 --> 10:35.042
I'm catching
her in the act.

10:35.044 --> 10:37.077
No, Sheldon, don't.

10:37.079 --> 10:38.412
Aha!

10:38.414 --> 10:39.780
What the hell?!

10:39.782 --> 10:41.048
Leonard?

10:41.050 --> 10:43.017
Sheldon, you cannot just
barge in here like that!

10:43.019 --> 10:45.219
Right.

10:47.556 --> 10:48.556
(knocking) Penny!

10:48.558 --> 10:51.125
(knocking) Penny!
(knocking) Penny!

10:53.995 --> 10:55.462
Are you going to

10:55.464 --> 10:58.532
answer the door or should I
open it and say "aha" again?

11:06.909 --> 11:08.510
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

11:08.512 --> 11:09.678
I should've told you I was back.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.580
I just wanted to have
a couple days alone with Penny.

11:11.582 --> 11:13.415
Oh, no, I should apologize.

11:13.417 --> 11:15.584
Uh, I never realized
to what extent

11:15.586 --> 11:17.619
our friendship was
a burden to you.

11:17.621 --> 11:19.287
(scoffs)
That is not fair.

11:19.289 --> 11:22.624
I complain about what a burden
it is at least once a month.

11:22.626 --> 11:24.225
Oh, no, no,
let's not sugarcoat this.

11:24.227 --> 11:28.196
You find me finicky,
pedantic and annoying.

11:28.198 --> 11:29.431
No, he doesn't.

11:29.433 --> 11:33.735
I actually have used
those exact words before.

11:33.737 --> 11:35.437
In that order.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.506
Well, Leonard,
I think it's high time

11:38.508 --> 11:42.010
you and I address
the "tweepadock" in the room.

11:42.012 --> 11:43.912
The what?

11:43.914 --> 11:45.714
Amy?
Please leave me out of this.

11:45.716 --> 11:47.515
Uh... fine.

11:47.517 --> 11:48.683
Leonard,

11:48.685 --> 11:49.985
there's no need for you

11:49.987 --> 11:51.453
to pretend to like me anymore.

11:51.455 --> 11:53.154
Come on, I said I was sorry.

11:53.156 --> 11:54.756
No, no, you save your apologies

11:54.758 --> 11:58.126
for after you've had
disappointing coitus with Penny.

12:00.129 --> 12:02.831
It was fine.

12:02.833 --> 12:04.499
Come on, this is silly.

12:04.501 --> 12:06.301
Hey, um, I brought you back

12:06.303 --> 12:09.638
a little present
from my trip, huh?

12:10.706 --> 12:12.507
It's that sailor cap
that you wanted.

12:12.509 --> 12:13.975
It's neat, huh?

12:15.011 --> 12:17.646
You honestly think you can
buy back my friendship

12:17.648 --> 12:19.047
with a cheap souvenir?

12:19.049 --> 12:20.882
I don't.

12:20.884 --> 12:21.950
No, I really don't.

12:21.952 --> 12:23.451
Just try it on.

12:26.622 --> 12:28.456
Oh, yeah.

12:28.458 --> 12:30.358
Hello, sailor.
Ooh, now we're talking.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.860
(whoops)

12:32.695 --> 12:34.629
Excuse me.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:43.172 --> 12:45.240
This changes nothing.

12:46.175 --> 12:47.375
Except the Halloween costume

12:47.377 --> 12:48.710
I'm wearing this year.

12:49.879 --> 12:51.646
Amy, you're going
to be Olive Oyl.

12:51.648 --> 12:53.214
Lay off the donuts.

12:56.919 --> 12:58.853
Thanks for coming over.

12:58.855 --> 12:59.754
No problem.

12:59.756 --> 13:01.556
Ooh, you made
little sandwiches!

13:01.558 --> 13:04.259
Yeah, that's cucumber
and cream cheese.

13:04.261 --> 13:05.960
That's turkey and loganberry.

13:05.962 --> 13:09.764
And don't tell my hips, but I'm
warming up a brie in the oven.

13:09.766 --> 13:11.766
Nice. So...

13:11.768 --> 13:13.735
Mmm. What's up?

13:13.737 --> 13:16.805
Okay, well, I've been reading up
on all the side effects

13:16.807 --> 13:18.807
you can get from estrogen,

13:18.809 --> 13:20.141
and...

13:20.143 --> 13:22.844
I need you to be honest with me.

13:22.846 --> 13:26.347
Do my boobs look bigger to you?

13:26.349 --> 13:29.150
Well, it's kind of hard to tell.

13:29.152 --> 13:31.119
Come on, Raj,
it's a "yes or no" question.

13:31.121 --> 13:32.454
I'm not sure.

13:32.456 --> 13:34.456
Um, wait.

13:34.458 --> 13:37.125
Jump up and down--
let's see if they jiggle.

13:43.432 --> 13:45.333
Uh, no, I...

13:45.335 --> 13:47.068
I still can't tell, uh...

13:47.070 --> 13:49.971
Oh, you know what?
Okay, uh, give me some of this.

13:53.042 --> 13:54.209
Seriously?

13:54.211 --> 13:55.577
Do you want my help or not?

13:56.412 --> 13:58.613
Fine.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.019
Okay, yup.

14:05.021 --> 14:07.689
See, see, that-that
looks like...

14:07.691 --> 14:08.790
that looks like
they could be bigger.

14:08.792 --> 14:09.858
(sighs)

14:09.860 --> 14:11.826
But you know, I bet...
I bet when I do it,

14:11.828 --> 14:14.896
mine do the same thing.

14:18.601 --> 14:20.001
Yeah, they kind of do.

14:20.003 --> 14:21.803
Hmm. Uh, let me
see something.

14:21.805 --> 14:24.506
Hey, easy!
(chuckles)

14:24.508 --> 14:26.141
My nipples are sensitive.

14:26.143 --> 14:27.142
Oh.

14:27.144 --> 14:28.309
Sorry, sorry, uh...

14:28.311 --> 14:29.811
(exhaling)

14:29.813 --> 14:32.013
Okay.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.953
I mean...

14:40.790 --> 14:42.824
Yeah, m-maybe.

14:42.826 --> 14:44.993
Okay, let me feel.

14:52.768 --> 14:56.304
No, I am definitely
up a cup size.

14:56.306 --> 14:57.539
You know, b-but
they're very firm,

14:57.541 --> 14:59.207
so you've got that
going for you.

14:59.209 --> 15:00.241
You think?

15:00.243 --> 15:02.443
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
very perky.

15:03.379 --> 15:04.712
Thank you.

15:04.714 --> 15:06.714
I really needed
to hear that today.

15:09.652 --> 15:10.952
(bell dings)
Ooh, brie's ready!

15:10.954 --> 15:13.021
Yay!

15:16.992 --> 15:17.992
Good morning.

15:17.994 --> 15:19.294
Hello.

15:19.296 --> 15:21.896
So am I driving
you to work

15:21.898 --> 15:23.731
or are you still mad at me?

15:23.733 --> 15:25.400
I'd like a ride.

15:26.235 --> 15:27.569
Assuming you actually do

15:27.571 --> 15:28.970
take me to work.

15:28.972 --> 15:30.839
Where do you think
I would take you?

15:30.841 --> 15:32.874
Who knows?

15:32.876 --> 15:34.943
Uh, you said
you'd be home yesterday,

15:34.945 --> 15:37.045
but you came home
three days ago.

15:37.047 --> 15:38.379
You say you're
taking me

15:38.381 --> 15:40.615
to work, but for all I know,

15:40.617 --> 15:44.285
I'll end up
in a deserted amusement park.

15:44.287 --> 15:46.921
Or a cornfield maze.

15:46.923 --> 15:48.723
Or a back alley dog fight.

15:48.725 --> 15:50.491
You tell me.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.427
I'm going to work.

15:52.429 --> 15:53.862
You can come if you want.

15:53.864 --> 15:56.064
Okay.

15:56.066 --> 15:59.434
By the way, you have
something on your shirt.

15:59.436 --> 16:00.935
No, I don't.

16:00.937 --> 16:02.403
Hurts, doesn't it?

16:07.343 --> 16:09.477
You know, I find
myself wondering

16:09.479 --> 16:11.946
if anything you've
ever told me is true.

16:11.948 --> 16:13.481
I didn't make it back.

16:13.483 --> 16:15.683
The ship sank,
I'm in hell.

16:17.853 --> 16:21.823
You say you're from New Jersey,
but how can I believe you?

16:21.825 --> 16:24.692
Why would anyone claim
to be from New Jersey

16:24.694 --> 16:26.828
if they weren't?

16:28.664 --> 16:30.865
All right,
I'll give you that one.

16:30.867 --> 16:33.534
Hey, I said
I was sorry.

16:33.536 --> 16:35.169
What else
do you want from me?

16:35.171 --> 16:37.171
I want you to admit that
what you did was wrong.

16:37.173 --> 16:38.172
Fine.

16:38.174 --> 16:40.475
What I did was wrong.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.176
I wish I could
believe you.

16:42.178 --> 16:43.945
(groans)

16:43.947 --> 16:44.946
You know what?

16:44.948 --> 16:46.281
I'm not driving
you to work,

16:46.283 --> 16:47.916
because you're
incredibly annoying.

16:47.918 --> 16:50.718
You say one thing
and do the other,

16:50.720 --> 16:54.522
so then you are driving me
and you find me a delight.

16:54.524 --> 16:56.524
Stop it.
Keep it up?

16:56.526 --> 16:57.325
Bye!

16:57.327 --> 16:58.893
Hello!

17:03.532 --> 17:07.635
So I guess you're really holding
up the other four fingers?

17:10.172 --> 17:12.073
Oh, hey, what are you
doing here so early?

17:12.075 --> 17:13.207
Driving Sheldon to work.

17:13.209 --> 17:14.842
He's still mad at Leonard, huh?

17:14.844 --> 17:16.210
Well, he's mad at you, too.

17:16.212 --> 17:20.181
He says you're the succubus
who led his friend astray.

17:21.784 --> 17:24.618
I don't know
what "succubus" is, but...

17:24.621 --> 17:27.355
it has "suck" in it,
so that can't be good.

17:28.724 --> 17:30.792
Thought I heard
you out here.

17:30.794 --> 17:31.693
Hey, Sheldon.

17:31.695 --> 17:33.161
You don't get a "hey."

17:33.163 --> 17:35.063
You get a "hmm."

17:35.065 --> 17:36.597
Come on, don't be like that.

17:36.599 --> 17:39.334
We had so much fun together
the last couple of months.

17:39.336 --> 17:40.568
You're right.

17:40.570 --> 17:42.437
Which makes your betrayal
all the more devastating.

17:42.439 --> 17:43.604
Sheldon...

17:43.606 --> 17:45.573
I let you buy
feminine hygiene products

17:45.575 --> 17:47.608
with my supermarket club card.

17:48.811 --> 17:50.645
You have any idea
the kind of coupons

17:50.647 --> 17:52.547
I'm going to get
in the mail now?

17:53.582 --> 17:55.016
Sheldon, your fight's
with Leonard.

17:55.018 --> 17:56.617
Penny's got nothing to do...
(stammers)

17:56.619 --> 17:58.353
Careful, Amy.

17:58.355 --> 18:02.190
The friend of my enemy's
girlfriend is my enemy.

18:02.192 --> 18:03.057
Really?

18:03.059 --> 18:04.158
Yes.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.793
You're either with me
or against me.

18:05.795 --> 18:08.129
You want to take
the bus to work?

18:08.998 --> 18:11.232
Maybe there's a third option.

18:13.402 --> 18:16.838
FYI, I had a doughnut
for breakfast, you jerk.

18:19.775 --> 18:21.743
So now we're just
waiting for the data

18:21.745 --> 18:23.111
from the ship to be crunched,

18:23.113 --> 18:25.747
but the numbers look
pretty promising.

18:25.749 --> 18:26.914
That's so great.

18:26.916 --> 18:29.050
If you guys prove the existence
of Unruh radiation...

18:29.052 --> 18:30.151
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

18:30.153 --> 18:31.753
My eyes are up here.

18:33.956 --> 18:35.523
Howard, Raj.

18:35.525 --> 18:37.325
Judas.

18:38.260 --> 18:39.494
You know what?

18:39.496 --> 18:40.962
You're a crazy person.

18:40.964 --> 18:43.264
A crazy person
with a long memory,

18:43.266 --> 18:46.334
and if all goes
according to plan, a robot army.

18:47.236 --> 18:48.236
Stop it.

18:48.238 --> 18:49.504
Or a mutant army.

18:49.506 --> 18:52.173
It depends on how
my Kickstarter goes.

18:53.409 --> 18:55.543
I said, stop it!

18:55.545 --> 18:57.945
Now, listen to me.

18:57.947 --> 19:01.416
You two aren't just friends.

19:01.418 --> 19:03.384
You're best friends.

19:04.086 --> 19:06.220
And that's a beautiful thing.

19:07.923 --> 19:11.859
I mean, Leonard, you know why
he's so mad at you?

19:11.861 --> 19:13.661
It's 'cause he missed you!

19:13.663 --> 19:15.296
Yeah, and as his friend,

19:15.298 --> 19:18.066
you should be happy

19:18.068 --> 19:21.269
he has love in his life.

19:21.271 --> 19:23.171
As I do.

19:25.007 --> 19:27.308
This man held my breast
the other day,

19:27.310 --> 19:29.143
and I love him for it.

19:30.979 --> 19:33.915
A little loud, dude.

19:35.217 --> 19:39.153
So, can we please put aside
these petty differences

19:39.155 --> 19:42.356
and just be glad
we're here together?

19:45.227 --> 19:46.928
Okay.
I suppose so.

19:46.930 --> 19:49.730
Thank you.

19:50.669 --> 19:51.969
Uh, it wasn't anything weird.

19:51.971 --> 19:54.271
It was just to see
how big they were.

20:03.784 --> 20:06.953
And then Leonard took me
to the barber and the dentist,

20:06.955 --> 20:08.755
and then to cap off
the perfect day,

20:08.757 --> 20:12.292
the Los Angeles Bureau
of Weights and Measures.

20:13.294 --> 20:15.362
I thought the measures
were going to be the stars

20:15.364 --> 20:18.765
of the show;
turns out it was the weights.

20:18.767 --> 20:21.835
I'm so glad you guys
are friends again.

20:21.837 --> 20:24.537
And I'm glad you and I
are friends again, too.

20:24.539 --> 20:25.905
Aw.
Which reminds me.

20:25.907 --> 20:28.675
This came in the mail,
and I want you to have it.

20:28.677 --> 20:32.212
"50 cents off Vagisil."

20:33.547 --> 20:36.349
Think of me
when you apply it.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.320
Uh, can I just say,

20:40.322 --> 20:42.455
I've missed all of us
hanging out together.

20:42.457 --> 20:44.090
Yeah.
Me, too.

20:44.092 --> 20:46.693
Um, since when can
Koothrappali talk

20:46.695 --> 20:48.461
in front of the girls
without a beer?

20:48.463 --> 20:50.664
Oh, that happened
right after you left.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.232
And no one told me?

20:52.234 --> 20:55.502
(voice breaks): Can't believe
we forgot to tell him.

20:57.338 --> 20:58.305
(clears throat)

20:58.307 --> 21:00.173
Think of Sheldon
when you apply it.
