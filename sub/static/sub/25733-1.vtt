01:20.591 --> 01:23.173
Oh, God, I don't like the crossfade.

01:24.507 --> 01:26.516
You want a hit?

01:28.076 --> 01:29.919
Maybe later.

01:31.023 --> 01:34.386
You know, Independence Day
should actually be July 2nd.

01:34.466 --> 01:37.471
That's the day the Continental Congress
decided to break from England.

01:37.551 --> 01:41.283
Well, yeah but didn't they also formally
adopt the Declaration on the 4th of July?

01:41.363 --> 01:45.810
Okay. If you wanna go that way, then the
Declaration wasn't signed until August 2nd...

01:45.890 --> 01:48.748
...so technically August 2nd
would be Independence Day.

01:48.828 --> 01:51.796
So what you're telling me is that
tomorrow is not the 4th of July.

01:51.876 --> 01:55.310
Well, it is the 4th but not "The 4th."

01:55.390 --> 01:57.404
If you're down with John Adams.

01:57.484 --> 02:00.724
Mm. May the 4th be with you.

02:01.839 --> 02:03.958
I am declaring my own Independence Day.

02:04.038 --> 02:08.898
Independence from parents and
teachers and school and everything.

02:08.978 --> 02:11.474
But you ever feel like that?

02:11.554 --> 02:15.399
- Maybe when I was your age.
- Okay, you are three months older than me.

02:20.137 --> 02:21.979
Look at that.

02:23.104 --> 02:25.893
- Look.
- There's no way that's a meteor.

02:25.973 --> 02:28.177
It's moving to slow.

02:30.290 --> 02:32.964
Hey! What are you doing? That's my song!

02:33.881 --> 02:36.459
There has to be something about this online.

02:38.420 --> 02:41.494
Well, yeah, everyone in Cumberland
has posted about it.

02:41.574 --> 02:43.375
Must be like a missile test or something.

02:43.455 --> 02:47.044
No, that's D.C., there's no way
they're testing missiles over there.

02:53.826 --> 02:55.630
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

03:04.241 --> 03:07.447
- Did my family land in Vermont yet?
- They just landed, sir.

03:07.527 --> 03:10.483
Good. I want a report
when they're in a secure position.

03:10.563 --> 03:12.413
Yes, Mr. President.

03:27.629 --> 03:31.797
- Have they said anything new?
- Same thing. They want it back.

03:31.877 --> 03:36.092
- Are you sure your translation's right?
- Sir, this comes direct from the asset.

03:36.856 --> 03:38.551
We'll be in position shortly, sir.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.335
Sorry to keep you in the dark, Smith.

03:48.415 --> 03:51.348
But I need you focused
on deciphering that thing.

03:53.917 --> 03:55.897
- Is everything in order?
- It is, sir.

03:55.977 --> 03:58.896
The rocket is ready to launch.
Waiting on your command.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.088
You find anything?

04:10.168 --> 04:13.713
I'm not getting anything
from any of the commercial sites.

04:13.793 --> 04:17.438
- The Pentagon has to know what this is.
- Good luck getting any info from them.

04:17.517 --> 04:19.416
I know a back way in.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.483
Cool.

04:29.679 --> 04:31.949
It's encrypted from within their site.

04:32.029 --> 04:35.626
Let me see.
Just override the digital certificate.

04:35.706 --> 04:41.275
No, that's not gonna work.
I got this. Okay, and here we go.

04:43.401 --> 04:46.611
Everybody's on high alert
but nobody's saying what it is.

04:47.784 --> 04:50.843
- What's that!
- They've launched a missile.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.779
I've got the nose camera on the screen, now.

04:55.867 --> 04:58.031
I could tell you one thing, Mr. President.

04:58.111 --> 05:02.601
You're about to see the biggest gosh-dang
fireworks show you've ever seen.

05:02.681 --> 05:06.126
Next message we get from those
boogers... if we get one at all...

05:06.206 --> 05:08.028
...will be a S.O.S.

05:08.108 --> 05:11.101
If, of course, Colonel Smith
can translate that information.

05:11.921 --> 05:13.770
I can handle it.

05:16.764 --> 05:18.691
Are we at war?

05:20.625 --> 05:22.262
Whoa.

05:22.342 --> 05:24.212
We gotta get out of here.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.553
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

05:31.117 --> 05:34.201
- What? You getting this?
- Yeah.

05:35.295 --> 05:37.543
Fifteen seconds to impact, sir.

05:53.039 --> 05:55.031
How's this for a hand shake!

06:03.423 --> 06:06.245
- Did you see that?
- Luke, come on.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.797
Visual's lost with the missiles, sir.

06:08.877 --> 06:12.713
Sir, we have picked up
the signature of the object again.

06:12.793 --> 06:15.194
- What do you mean?
- It's moving towards us.

06:15.274 --> 06:18.154
- Which direction is it headed?
- Washington D.C.

06:18.234 --> 06:21.505
And, sir, we've picked up
the transmission again...

06:21.585 --> 06:23.768
- ...same message as before.
- The one we decoded?

06:23.848 --> 06:26.453
Yes. It's identical.

06:27.591 --> 06:29.399
They want it back.

06:42.815 --> 06:45.585
We've mobilized the Air Force
and Air National Guard.

06:45.665 --> 06:48.849
We grounded Air Force One.
It's too big a target.

06:48.929 --> 06:51.013
So we'll go with Marine One.

06:51.093 --> 06:55.091
Standing by, sir. That's not
what I think it is, is it, Colonel Smith?

06:55.171 --> 06:57.393
Sir, this is the device.

06:57.473 --> 07:01.371
- I thought it was on the way to Lake Groom.
- It was but we've had a new development.

07:01.451 --> 07:06.132
If that's what's been bringing them here,
maybe it isn't wise to be toting it around.

07:06.212 --> 07:09.535
The case shields it from all spectrum
interference. Detection should be impossible.

07:09.615 --> 07:14.029
If it is impossible to detect then what was it
that brought them here in the first place?

07:14.119 --> 07:16.008
Sir, it wasn't encased
when we first obtained the device.

07:16.088 --> 07:18.679
We only did that when we discovered
it was transmitting information.

07:18.759 --> 07:22.479
- You were at that briefing, sir.
- Colonel! What is the new development?

07:22.559 --> 07:25.412
In layman's terms, the arrival
today has caused a change...

07:25.582 --> 07:28.615
- ...in the device's operational status.
- Spit it out, Colonel.

07:29.261 --> 07:31.470
The device is now active.

07:41.681 --> 07:44.642
Sir, I recommend an alteration in
flight plans. We need to visit the asset.

07:44.722 --> 07:46.577
It might be our only chance
to get on top of this.

07:46.657 --> 07:49.480
Mr. President, it's a quick diversion
on the way to Reagan Rock.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.386
I agree with the Colonel.

07:52.719 --> 07:54.254
Okay.

08:04.940 --> 08:08.185
- Destination, Mr. President?
- Bunker 25 on the outskirts.

08:08.265 --> 08:10.230
Copy that, Colonel.
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

08:10.310 --> 08:13.546
Buckle up. We're waiting for the
all-clear command from Air Control.

08:13.626 --> 08:16.754
Mr. President. We brought in
the device when we made contact.

08:16.834 --> 08:19.668
Despite the full spectrum shielding
we did notice some activity...

08:19.748 --> 08:22.588
- ...that coincided with their arrival.
- So what you're saying is...

08:22.668 --> 08:26.627
...not only do we have a threat
from above but their doomsday device...

08:26.707 --> 08:29.632
...could initiate its final
sequence at any moment?

08:29.712 --> 08:31.991
Sir, I wouldn't exactly characterize it
as a doomsday device.

08:32.071 --> 08:34.245
This device that you're carrying, Colonel...

08:34.325 --> 08:37.409
...has the capability of ending
our world as we know it.

08:37.489 --> 08:41.413
If it hasn't already, by bringing
a full-scale extraterrestrial invasion.

08:41.493 --> 08:44.585
So don't tell me it's not
a doomsday device, Colonel.

08:45.671 --> 08:47.542
Yes, sir.

08:47.922 --> 08:51.841
This is why we're going to see the asset.
No one has more knowledge of its workings.

08:51.921 --> 08:53.228
What are we waiting for then? Let's go!

08:53.308 --> 08:56.367
We're waiting for the confirmation
on the clear air space, Mr. President.

08:56.447 --> 08:58.384
Copy that, General.

09:03.184 --> 09:04.739
Guys, we gotta go.

09:05.064 --> 09:07.067
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.775
Luke.

09:34.733 --> 09:36.594
Hey, Rachel!

09:38.520 --> 09:40.150
What?

09:40.230 --> 09:42.117
Take a look at this.

09:51.255 --> 09:53.023
Never seen anything like it.

09:53.752 --> 09:55.822
Where's Luke?

09:55.902 --> 09:58.167
I don't know. He left with his friends.

10:04.328 --> 10:06.203
Oh, my God.

10:16.906 --> 10:19.937
All right. Let's get in the house.
Now. Go! Go!

10:29.614 --> 10:32.708
- Oh, no.
- Let's go! We have to get out of here!

10:32.788 --> 10:34.849
The air space is not clear, Mr. President.

10:34.929 --> 10:38.452
Air Traffic Command has issued
a no-fly zone over D.C. until it's all clear.

10:38.532 --> 10:42.472
- That's a direct order.
- Copy that, Mr. President.

11:03.177 --> 11:04.503
Request air support.

11:04.583 --> 11:09.086
Do you have some kind of evasive maneuvers
up your sleeve? I suggest you use it. Now!

11:15.746 --> 11:18.095
Come on! Come on!

11:18.575 --> 11:22.198
Wait, wait, wait!
Guys, no, no, I live this way.

11:23.145 --> 11:26.524
- I'll take you.
- I gotta get back home too.

11:26.604 --> 11:29.464
- Okay, well, we'll see you.
- Okay.

11:40.075 --> 11:43.568
- He has Paige with him.
- Okay, we'll drop her off at home.

11:56.530 --> 11:58.962
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna pick up Luke.

11:59.042 --> 12:01.499
We'll go to the mountains
and stay at the cabin by the lake.

12:01.579 --> 12:03.751
I think we're being invaded.

12:08.543 --> 12:11.208
- Hey, you better call your parents.
- What about you?

12:11.288 --> 12:13.218
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does.

12:13.298 --> 12:16.440
No, it doesn't. They're not even
in the country. They're in France...

12:16.520 --> 12:19.491
- ...on some holiday for like a month.
- Wait, so you're alone?

12:19.571 --> 12:23.704
- I have the maid during the day, but...
- No, why don't you come to my house?

12:23.784 --> 12:27.955
- Your parents don't exactly like me.
- Shut up. They like you.

12:30.647 --> 12:32.456
Better get that.

12:36.131 --> 12:39.811
Mom. Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't answer.

12:41.558 --> 12:43.356
Yes. I saw it.

12:45.074 --> 12:47.181
I'm... I'm coming home.

12:47.261 --> 12:49.672
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

12:50.474 --> 12:53.246
Okay. Okay.

12:53.326 --> 12:55.127
Love you.

12:57.587 --> 12:59.796
They're coming to the church to pick us up.

13:04.498 --> 13:07.094
We got the First Lady
on the line, Mr. President.

13:09.425 --> 13:10.991
Hey.

13:11.712 --> 13:13.554
Wanted you and the little one to know...

13:13.634 --> 13:17.427
...we're out of harm's way. We got out.

13:17.507 --> 13:21.439
A convoy is on its way to pick you up
and take you to Reagan Rock.

13:22.725 --> 13:24.573
Yeah, I understand.

13:25.053 --> 13:27.710
Yeah, of course I want to be with you...

13:27.790 --> 13:30.217
...but that can't happen right now.

13:30.297 --> 13:34.364
We'll be there soon. No, no.
You have to stay where you are.

13:39.293 --> 13:41.937
- This doesn't make any sense.
- What?

13:42.017 --> 13:45.902
They're saying... the U.S. Capitol is gone.

13:45.982 --> 13:48.427
I don't know. Everyone is freaking out.

13:48.507 --> 13:51.204
The whole military is going into action.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.966
- What's wrong?
- I just lost signal.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.225
Me too.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.947
Does anybody have service?

14:14.850 --> 14:16.836
Let's go.

14:21.198 --> 14:23.281
- They're on us.
- All right.

14:23.361 --> 14:26.943
You guys are always bragging about
what you can do when you open this thing up.

14:27.023 --> 14:30.251
- Now is the time to go for it.
- You got it, Mr. President.

14:30.331 --> 14:32.568
Hang on! It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

14:37.860 --> 14:40.799
- Where's the air support you called for?
- Air support is en route.

14:40.879 --> 14:44.391
- We stick to our flight plan.
- Where's the V.P. now?

14:44.471 --> 14:46.548
- Can I get a line on her?
- Sir?

14:46.628 --> 14:48.672
I wanna check her status.

15:09.979 --> 15:13.046
They can't get a clear shot with that thing
on our tail. We have to do something.

15:13.126 --> 15:15.544
Hang on! We're going low!

15:27.201 --> 15:28.882
No!

15:33.525 --> 15:37.704
- Arms over your head! Mr. President!
- Protect yourselves! If I go down...

15:37.784 --> 15:39.198
...it'll be chin up.

15:56.069 --> 15:58.216
They might need our help.

16:12.824 --> 16:14.371
Clear!

16:17.445 --> 16:18.852
- We need to move.
- We can't leave...

16:18.932 --> 16:20.764
I got it.

16:28.672 --> 16:30.623
Stop right there!

16:32.165 --> 16:35.802
- Don't shoot! We're Americans!
- Stay where you are!

16:37.082 --> 16:38.903
They're kids.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.108
They're coming back!

16:49.167 --> 16:51.007
Get down!

17:15.047 --> 17:18.777
Let's move! That means you too. On your feet!

17:18.857 --> 17:21.532
- Come on.
- We have to get out of the open.

17:26.492 --> 17:30.044
That's the president.
That's the president of the United States.

17:30.124 --> 17:32.225
Yeah, come on. Come on.

17:42.522 --> 17:44.400
Phone's out.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.537
It's a bad zone for service.

17:47.732 --> 17:49.745
Luke is supposed to be here.

17:50.325 --> 17:53.375
- Where is he?
- Don't worry. We'll find him.

17:53.755 --> 17:56.164
Let's, uh... let's head towards the park.

18:04.779 --> 18:07.093
I've never seen Main Street so deserted.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.957
The new arrival must have
scared a lot of people.

18:10.479 --> 18:12.338
Go, go, go, go!

18:13.785 --> 18:15.301
Go, go, go, go!

18:20.473 --> 18:24.302
People acting crazy cause they're scared.
All right. We're not gonna let that happen.

18:25.182 --> 18:27.252
Working together.
That's how we're gonna do this, okay?

18:27.332 --> 18:29.101
Okay.

18:43.491 --> 18:45.399
Oh, my God. Patrick, stop.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.720
Oh, my God.

18:51.771 --> 18:53.831
Wait! Rachel!

19:03.154 --> 19:05.115
Who is that?

19:05.195 --> 19:07.008
Oh, my God.

19:09.564 --> 19:12.537
- It's Ryan.
- Wasn't he with Luke?

19:13.917 --> 19:15.792
We don't know that for sure.

19:17.211 --> 19:19.703
- Luke!
- Rachel! Hey, hey!

19:21.873 --> 19:24.469
Stop. Look, it's not safe.
I need you to stay at the truck.

19:24.549 --> 19:26.958
No! I'm coming with you.

20:11.526 --> 20:13.171
Patrick.

20:13.251 --> 20:15.159
Stay back.

20:19.491 --> 20:21.021
Oh.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.880
Don't look. It's not Luke.

20:53.233 --> 20:55.410
Where do those things come from?

20:55.796 --> 20:58.241
It looks like some kind of teleporter.

20:58.321 --> 21:00.260
Beams those things from
the mother ship to Earth.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.973
- Let's go.
- No, no, no. Wait. Stop.

21:05.445 --> 21:07.331
We gotta break it.

21:08.057 --> 21:09.614
Stop the invasion.

21:10.194 --> 21:14.235
- What about Luke? Where is he?
- We'll find him. I promise. Okay?

21:14.315 --> 21:16.546
But if I don't do something, this town's
gonna be crawling with these things.

21:16.626 --> 21:18.801
No one will be safe. It has to be done, okay?

21:18.881 --> 21:20.746
So go back to the truck
and I'll be there in a minute.

21:20.826 --> 21:25.476
No. If you wanna act like an idiot,
someone has to watch your back.

21:28.245 --> 21:32.845
Okay. But if one of those things come close,
you pump them full of lead, all right?

21:32.925 --> 21:35.560
There. There's seven rounds in there.

21:36.140 --> 21:40.504
And there's seven here. If things go down,
you keep firing and you get back to the truck.

21:40.584 --> 21:42.797
- Okay.
- Okay?

22:12.572 --> 22:14.146
Stay.

24:12.598 --> 24:13.940
Rachel!

24:49.032 --> 24:51.418
Are you okay? Come on.

24:52.196 --> 24:53.945
Oh, God.

25:10.762 --> 25:12.605
What is this thing?

25:22.680 --> 25:24.031
Hold on.

25:24.111 --> 25:26.956
- We can't stop, sir.
- I need a break.

25:28.136 --> 25:30.992
- What's the status on...
- I don't have an answer now.

25:31.072 --> 25:35.386
Excuse me. You're Ben Draper. Our President.

25:35.466 --> 25:38.016
Sure looks like him, doesn't he?
He's a decoy.

25:38.096 --> 25:40.709
We've got dozens of look-alikes running
around. It's a tactic to confuse enemies.

25:40.789 --> 25:44.160
- I'm not buying that.
- It doesn't matter if you buy it.

25:44.240 --> 25:47.184
Oh, so you're then you're just
some fake decoy military officer?

25:47.264 --> 25:49.939
And the guy back there that got killed,
he's a decoy as well?

25:50.019 --> 25:53.042
- I hope his pay is good.
- Enough!

25:53.122 --> 25:54.862
I'm the president.

25:55.042 --> 25:59.983
Is someone gonna tell us what's going on?
Who is attacking us? Is... are we at war?

26:00.063 --> 26:01.937
They're aliens, aren't they?

26:04.194 --> 26:06.064
Thank you for your bravery.

26:07.836 --> 26:10.873
Most people wouldn't fault you
for running in the other direction.

26:10.953 --> 26:13.009
When they see a helicopter crash.

26:14.012 --> 26:17.879
But you came to our aid.
And I want to thank you.

26:18.970 --> 26:22.102
According to our last position
we aren't far from our objective here.

26:22.182 --> 26:26.341
Until we have an extraction point, we continue
moving forward. We don't have a choice.

26:26.421 --> 26:28.586
We'll need communication.
Do you guys have a phone?

26:28.666 --> 26:30.998
I have mine but none
of our phones are working.

26:31.078 --> 26:33.125
We have to figure out another way.

26:33.771 --> 26:36.198
I... I do have a mesh network.

26:36.278 --> 26:39.188
It's a... a network that's off
the cellular grid.

26:39.268 --> 26:43.545
Electronics can work in proximity.
But only with others that are on the network.

26:43.625 --> 26:46.553
- We use it to talk to each other sometimes.
- I built it in 9th grade.

26:46.633 --> 26:49.506
- I helped.
- We built it together.

26:49.586 --> 26:51.790
Rigged up all the transmitters.

26:52.376 --> 26:55.399
This could help.
Tell me more about your setup.

27:15.128 --> 27:18.896
- Oh! Patrick!
- Baby! Baby! Come with me.

27:19.464 --> 27:22.996
Up, up, up. Come on. Come on.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.011
Come on, baby.

28:10.672 --> 28:13.125
- Let me look at you.
- No, no, leave me! Go find Luke!

28:13.205 --> 28:15.579
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- No!

28:15.659 --> 28:18.094
- I'm not leaving you!
- No!

28:45.401 --> 28:47.279
Sit down.

28:49.289 --> 28:52.519
Sit down right here. Right here, okay?

28:54.629 --> 28:55.837
Okay.

28:55.917 --> 28:57.969
All right, okay.

29:00.364 --> 29:02.215
My phone! I left my phone!

29:02.295 --> 29:04.924
- No. I know. I need you to calm down.
- Luke is gonna call us.

29:05.004 --> 29:08.837
- Okay, we'll find him, he'll be okay.
- How are we gonna do that from here?

29:08.917 --> 29:10.825
Look, I need you to breathe.

29:11.411 --> 29:13.742
Breathe. Breathe, okay?

29:13.822 --> 29:16.849
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna take care of your leg...

29:16.929 --> 29:18.990
...then we're gonna figure out
what we're gonna do next, okay?

29:19.070 --> 29:22.566
- We need to find Luke.
- We will.

29:24.219 --> 29:26.023
By night.

29:31.056 --> 29:32.505
Patrick.

29:34.394 --> 29:37.614
Okay. Luke's a smart kid.
He's a smart kid, right?

29:38.415 --> 29:41.908
If he's out in this, he's gonna... he's
gonna find someplace to lay down low.

29:42.188 --> 29:43.496
Okay.

29:48.753 --> 29:50.605
Under here!

29:52.033 --> 29:54.803
Luke and Paige, how wide of an area
did you say your mesh network covered?

29:54.883 --> 29:56.884
- A good three miles.
- Two and a half.

29:56.964 --> 30:01.191
I think their mesh network could be useful
in establishing a line of communication.

30:01.271 --> 30:02.833
Good idea.

30:04.245 --> 30:06.463
You've both been very brave here today.

30:07.757 --> 30:09.556
Braver than most.

30:11.239 --> 30:14.332
People like you are the reason
I ran for office.

30:15.070 --> 30:16.560
Get out of here!

30:17.493 --> 30:19.310
Get down!

30:21.093 --> 30:24.145
Mr. President, stay with
the briefcase. I'll catch up.

30:31.433 --> 30:32.876
Paige!

30:42.396 --> 30:43.939
Run!

31:51.021 --> 31:54.274
- What's the status?
- There's no change.

31:54.951 --> 31:57.039
Wait, there is something.

31:57.519 --> 32:00.836
- Looks like it tried to deactivate it.
- Did it work?

32:00.916 --> 32:04.354
No, something's happening to it,
but it's not deactivated.

32:04.434 --> 32:06.360
What is it?

32:08.225 --> 32:10.489
We need to get to the asset ASAP.

32:11.046 --> 32:13.213
Come on, let's double-time.

32:26.330 --> 32:28.177
This way.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.332
Stay low!

32:44.409 --> 32:47.350
Wait! They're human!

32:53.905 --> 32:55.277
Mom!

32:55.357 --> 32:58.054
Oh, Luke! Oh, my God!

32:58.134 --> 33:00.666
Mom! Mom!

33:01.146 --> 33:02.593
Mom!

33:02.673 --> 33:05.569
- What... what happened to your leg?
- I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

33:05.649 --> 33:07.598
- I knew you kids would be okay.
- Oh, my God.

33:07.678 --> 33:09.487
Come on.

33:11.113 --> 33:12.961
We've gotta get you off the road.

33:38.606 --> 33:41.548
You look like you need
some assistance, ma'am.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.698
You're the president.

33:46.068 --> 33:48.763
- Mr. President, it's an honor to serve you.
- Yeah, let's get inside.

33:48.843 --> 33:53.622
- Take a seat over here.
- I'm fine, sir, uh, Mr. President.

34:07.537 --> 34:09.567
Stay quiet.

34:57.984 --> 35:00.924
So those... those things
out there, Mr. President...

35:01.875 --> 35:05.050
...are they from, uh, up there?

35:06.793 --> 35:08.467
Six years ago...

35:09.714 --> 35:11.723
- ...during the term of my predecessor...
- Mr. President...

35:11.803 --> 35:15.110
...we received first contact
from a being from another planet.

35:17.717 --> 35:19.604
You mean aliens.

35:20.397 --> 35:22.844
- That's right.
- Six years?

35:22.924 --> 35:24.788
You've been hiding this for six years?

35:24.868 --> 35:27.755
I wasn't given the intel until I took office.

35:29.586 --> 35:33.330
This being was a refugee
from a distant world.

35:35.505 --> 35:38.745
It was injured, but we brought it back.

35:40.174 --> 35:42.426
This refugee told us...

35:43.192 --> 35:45.407
...he was an engineer.

35:46.006 --> 35:48.428
Wait, it spoke English?

35:49.245 --> 35:52.707
It knew how to communicate with us.
It seemed to know everything about us.

35:52.787 --> 35:56.854
The Engineer told us its world
had been taken over by warmongers...

35:57.334 --> 36:00.178
...their leaders irrational...

36:00.320 --> 36:02.320
...and full of hate.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.836
What do they want with us?

36:05.548 --> 36:08.965
The Engineer is part of a program
to build a device...

36:09.045 --> 36:11.086
...that would dominate the universe.

36:11.410 --> 36:13.478
That briefcase right there...

36:13.558 --> 36:16.404
...the one the aliens were trying
to steal, it's part of this, isn't it?

36:16.484 --> 36:18.228
What is in there?

36:18.861 --> 36:20.152
That's classified.

36:20.232 --> 36:22.448
That's what the alien refugee gave us...

36:22.528 --> 36:24.432
...alien technology...

36:24.512 --> 36:27.313
...probably the most
powerful in the universe...

36:28.440 --> 36:30.685
...and the only one in existence.

36:32.618 --> 36:35.955
- And they want it back.
- I think that's enough information, sir.

36:36.635 --> 36:40.051
Mr. President, how did you
end up on the edge of the city?

36:41.697 --> 36:43.539
We fell from above.

36:45.152 --> 36:48.049
And thankfully your son
and his friend here...

36:49.625 --> 36:51.530
...found us.

36:53.641 --> 36:56.164
How are you, ma'am? How are you?

36:56.244 --> 36:58.049
I'm okay.

36:58.688 --> 37:02.261
Didn't hit an artery. It's stable for now,
but it's not gonna be for long.

37:02.961 --> 37:05.047
Can I take a look?

37:11.675 --> 37:14.057
Luke, you don't need to see this.

37:15.443 --> 37:17.276
It's okay, he can see it.

37:20.884 --> 37:22.137
Luke...

37:23.551 --> 37:25.042
...you okay?

37:26.769 --> 37:28.319
Yeah.

37:31.515 --> 37:34.200
- We have to remove it.
- The leg?

37:34.280 --> 37:36.578
No, son, that bit of metal.

37:41.539 --> 37:45.710
We need to get you somewhere with some
first aid supplies. You're a vet, right?

37:45.790 --> 37:48.761
- Marine Corps, 22 years.
- What's your MLS?

37:48.841 --> 37:51.324
Marine Raider, reconnaissance corpsman.

37:52.492 --> 37:54.980
Patrick, glad to have you with us.

37:57.367 --> 38:00.930
Right now, we're on our own.
Our land is hostile territory.

38:01.010 --> 38:05.351
The president and I got shot down on
our way to a top-secret location nearby.

38:05.431 --> 38:07.714
You need to get first aid supplies
and your family to safe cover.

38:07.794 --> 38:11.444
That syncs with our current objective, so
we'll accompany you there and be on our way.

38:11.524 --> 38:13.795
Colonel and Mr. President,
it'd be my honor to serve you...

38:13.875 --> 38:16.654
...but my duty is towards my family first.

38:16.734 --> 38:19.155
Son, I wouldn't have it any other way.

38:19.855 --> 38:21.528
And what, may I ask, is your objective?

38:21.608 --> 38:23.259
- Your house.
- What?

38:23.339 --> 38:25.776
- We need to access your mesh network.
- My what?

38:25.856 --> 38:29.871
- It's a network Luke...
- It's a setup for emergency times.

38:31.183 --> 38:33.353
And this is at my house?

38:33.433 --> 38:37.175
In the vicinity.
Luke here pointed us the way.

38:38.145 --> 38:41.579
Now if it's still operational,
we'd like to put it to use.

38:43.282 --> 38:45.891
Yeah, okay, whatever... whatever you need.

38:47.310 --> 38:49.314
Okay. Let's go.

39:04.739 --> 39:05.821
We need to stay off the road.

39:05.901 --> 39:08.850
We can cut through the woods.
It comes through at Fairview gas station.

39:08.930 --> 39:10.446
Okay.

39:15.680 --> 39:19.548
I know. Let's see if we can
find you some painkillers, okay?

39:24.441 --> 39:26.162
You've been brave.

39:27.805 --> 39:31.432
Come on. I know, I know, I know. Okay.

39:35.178 --> 39:38.047
Okay. Here.

39:50.306 --> 39:51.579
Guys?

39:53.342 --> 39:55.569
Get down! Get down!

40:02.492 --> 40:03.939
Patrick!

40:23.499 --> 40:25.120
There's more of them!

40:28.051 --> 40:29.318
Luke!

40:41.456 --> 40:45.884
- How much ammo do you have in that thing?
- Enough for this one.

41:01.855 --> 41:05.608
- Get in, in, in, in, get in, in, in!
- Go, go!

41:07.382 --> 41:10.806
Get... get in! Get in there! Get in!

41:11.342 --> 41:13.114
- Keep down!
- Hide!

41:15.520 --> 41:19.206
Smith! Smith, what are you doing?
Smith, get back!

41:19.286 --> 41:21.287
Get back! Smith!

41:26.978 --> 41:28.097
Smith!

41:33.401 --> 41:35.284
We're clear, let's go!

41:56.126 --> 41:59.782
That must be the weak spot.
I tried stabbing one back at the barn.

41:59.862 --> 42:02.465
That was the only place I could penetrate.

42:02.545 --> 42:04.638
- Easy, easy, easy.
- I'm fine.

42:04.718 --> 42:06.552
No, you're not. We've gotta get you home.

42:06.632 --> 42:09.633
Colonel, we need to get her home
and take care of that leg.

42:10.421 --> 42:12.841
Copy that. You got whatever meds you need?

42:14.044 --> 42:17.658
We gotta get off this road, guys.
We're too exposed.

42:49.892 --> 42:51.717
Sit on the couch.

42:55.202 --> 42:56.758
Come on.

42:56.838 --> 42:58.711
Power's out.

43:01.638 --> 43:03.391
- What you need?
- We need towels.

43:03.471 --> 43:04.852
Okay.

43:05.181 --> 43:08.534
The gas should still be working.
Can you boil some water please?

43:12.166 --> 43:15.416
Don't look at it, don't look at it,
look at me. We're gonna get this out.

43:15.496 --> 43:17.100
Okay. Okay.

43:17.180 --> 43:20.877
This is gonna hurt, but we
need to do this, okay? Luke...

43:21.897 --> 43:24.947
Luke. Can you show me your mesh network?

43:25.027 --> 43:26.557
Okay.

43:27.103 --> 43:28.595
Does it need power?

43:28.675 --> 43:33.173
Hey. All right, just relax... breathe,
breathe, breathe. Lie back, lie back.

43:33.253 --> 43:36.959
Just breathe, relax. Okay. Be strong, okay?

43:37.039 --> 43:39.865
I'm gonna go upstairs and get
the rest of the ammo, okay?

43:41.565 --> 43:45.614
Breathe for me, okay? Breathe.
Relax. Breathe. Okay.

44:10.085 --> 44:12.550
It'll run for nearly a week on this.

44:14.605 --> 44:16.155
- Okay.
- How big is your network?

44:16.235 --> 44:18.982
- We have 10 spots up on it now.
- It goes nearly to the Point...

44:19.062 --> 44:21.638
...but people keep stealing our setups
over there, so we've kept it close.

44:21.718 --> 44:22.770
- Can you hook it up to a laptop?
- Yeah.

44:22.850 --> 44:25.920
Do you have one on you?
Do it. Let me know when it's done.

44:43.423 --> 44:46.937
Now I told you to breathe.
Breathe. Just stay strong.

44:47.017 --> 44:50.237
I'm gonna go upstairs and get
the rest of the bullets, okay? All right.

44:50.317 --> 44:53.394
Breathe for me. Okay? Breathe. All right?

44:56.931 --> 44:58.744
Hey, Rachel, how you feeling?

44:59.643 --> 45:01.529
This'll be quick.

45:19.472 --> 45:21.889
Patrick, you know I don't drink.

45:22.538 --> 45:24.352
It's for me.

45:32.924 --> 45:34.514
Honey.

45:40.248 --> 45:41.505
Network's good.

45:46.994 --> 45:49.059
Your mom's gonna be fine.

45:50.519 --> 45:52.375
How's everything on your end?

45:53.709 --> 45:56.880
The network's up. Connections
are shaky, but they're good.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.561
Okay. Let's get this set up.

46:02.731 --> 46:04.784
The original Internet was military,
you know that?

46:04.864 --> 46:06.012
ARPANET.

46:06.092 --> 46:08.892
We gave it away, but we kept
something for ourselves.

46:08.972 --> 46:11.778
We maintain an alternate internet
over high-band radio frequency.

46:11.858 --> 46:15.064
Thanks to your mesh network,
we're accessing it right now.

46:15.544 --> 46:18.480
Mr. President, we need to
figure out an extraction point.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.900
I'll tap into two-way radio comms.

46:38.313 --> 46:42.323
This is Eagle One. I repeat,
this is Eagle One. Please respond.

46:42.403 --> 46:46.231
Mr. President, will you keep an eye on that?
Patrick, let's go check on your wife's wound.

46:50.324 --> 46:52.264
This is Eagle One, over.

47:04.824 --> 47:07.463
- Can I take a look?
- Yeah.

47:16.910 --> 47:20.094
Okay. If it starts bleeding again,
let me know, but it looks good.

47:20.174 --> 47:23.345
Painful, but we're lucky
it didn't hit an artery.

47:23.425 --> 47:25.308
Thank you.

47:26.088 --> 47:28.397
Your mom is one tough cookie, Luke.

47:30.123 --> 47:32.221
I see where you got your moxie.

47:33.161 --> 47:37.003
You should get something to eat from
the kitchen. I know you're hungry.

47:38.055 --> 47:39.055
Thank you.

47:39.135 --> 47:42.561
We made quite a spread for the 4th of July.

47:42.923 --> 47:45.392
It would be a shame for it to go to waste.

48:03.926 --> 48:06.197
You do tech for the Army?

48:06.277 --> 48:10.405
My team decoded the language
with the help of a classified source.

48:10.485 --> 48:13.464
We were just starting to understand
the software when they showed up.

48:13.544 --> 48:16.236
Is it a linear binary code?

48:16.316 --> 48:18.599
Who's the classified source?

48:20.146 --> 48:22.008
It's classified.

48:48.535 --> 48:50.421
Let's check the artillery.

48:52.700 --> 48:55.573
Son, you'll get a medal
for what you've done today.

48:57.303 --> 48:58.775
Yes, I will.

49:10.488 --> 49:12.327
You're kidding me.

49:13.765 --> 49:17.118
The device is connecting to a mesh network.

49:17.564 --> 49:19.111
What?

49:20.245 --> 49:23.516
It looks like a duplicate operating system...

49:23.596 --> 49:25.797
...like they made an off-device copy.

49:25.877 --> 49:28.665
But it's connecting.

49:44.051 --> 49:45.917
- Haskell.
- Don't.

49:45.997 --> 49:47.779
- What?
- Don't use Haskell.

49:47.859 --> 49:51.434
- Try something imperative.
- No, we'll use Haskell, it's too risky.

50:17.294 --> 50:19.554
They're surface-to-air missiles.

50:23.090 --> 50:24.976
They're close.

50:26.398 --> 50:28.284
We can't stay here.

50:42.014 --> 50:44.569
No, not that. Try this.

50:46.941 --> 50:49.254
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

50:49.334 --> 50:52.304
That looks like some kind
of an initiation code.

50:52.384 --> 50:55.873
- That's a trigger, don't touch that!
- It's not a trigger, it is something else.

50:55.953 --> 50:57.631
Do you see that?

51:01.611 --> 51:03.871
It's an alphanumeric code.

51:06.367 --> 51:08.458
We can disable this thing?

51:10.384 --> 51:12.271
Let's do it together.

51:33.356 --> 51:36.260
Stop! Get away from it!

51:38.277 --> 51:39.408
What have you done?

51:39.488 --> 51:42.889
When your team copied the operating
system, they left a link open.

51:42.969 --> 51:44.661
It was still connected,
and it let us back in.

51:44.741 --> 51:46.545
And you thought it would be
a good idea to touch any of it?

51:46.625 --> 51:49.229
- What if that accidentally triggers it?
- We didn't trigger anything.

51:49.309 --> 51:52.790
- It's a manual trigger. We didn't touch that.
- You are about to be in a world of hurt.

51:53.370 --> 51:55.515
You have no idea what you've done.

52:11.184 --> 52:12.620
Oh, my God.

52:31.701 --> 52:34.158
Smith! Smith!

52:34.238 --> 52:37.741
Everybody out. Come on, out. Come on,
let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on.

52:37.821 --> 52:40.232
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

52:44.997 --> 52:47.457
Patrick? Patrick?

53:01.134 --> 53:03.220
There's more coming.

53:08.502 --> 53:10.489
We need more ammo.

53:22.498 --> 53:24.526
This won't stop them for long.

53:31.208 --> 53:35.344
I need you to go upstairs, the extra gun's
in the lockbox in the bedroom. Okay? Go.

53:35.424 --> 53:37.515
Go, go, go, go.

54:08.087 --> 54:10.378
God, get off me!

54:11.378 --> 54:12.920
Luke!

54:15.138 --> 54:17.544
Hey, let go of her!

54:35.487 --> 54:37.057
Luke!

55:20.084 --> 55:22.881
You need fireworks,
they ran through their armor.

56:06.989 --> 56:08.383
Go!

56:08.463 --> 56:12.192
- Keep the device safe.
- Keep my family safe, too, please.

56:12.690 --> 56:14.539
I will.

57:02.417 --> 57:04.390
Luke, it's under the bed.

57:09.528 --> 57:11.597
Guys, there's more coming.

57:14.616 --> 57:16.733
Do you know how to use one of those things?

57:21.183 --> 57:23.375
- Here.
- What? I don't know how to use this.

57:23.455 --> 57:25.767
Hold it like this. This is the safety.

57:25.847 --> 57:29.551
When you're ready to shoot,
aim by lining up the sites.

57:29.631 --> 57:31.735
Did your dad teach you this?

57:31.815 --> 57:33.345
Yeah.

57:34.201 --> 57:35.850
Thanks.

57:41.412 --> 57:43.715
- Ready?
- Yes.

58:33.438 --> 58:34.629
Luke!

59:18.360 --> 59:20.456
I'm still linked to their device.

59:21.420 --> 59:24.012
Don't do that.
They told you not to mess with that!

59:24.092 --> 59:26.818
- But we can fix this.
- Stop it.

59:27.333 --> 59:29.539
If we don't stop this thing, who will?

59:29.619 --> 59:31.167
Stop!

59:32.522 --> 59:35.999
We don't have a lot of time.
You need to tell me what you did.

59:36.079 --> 59:37.826
It's linear coding.

59:37.906 --> 59:40.046
It's an off-unit sequence.

59:40.126 --> 59:42.413
Tell us what it does, and we'll tell you.

59:46.288 --> 59:49.272
We don't have the time for this. You two
made the situation exponentially worse.

59:49.352 --> 59:52.872
You need to tell me what you did, now.

59:52.952 --> 59:55.417
Colonel, ma'am...

59:55.497 --> 59:58.507
...you and the president haven't been
straight with us since we met.

59:58.587 --> 01:00:01.607
You hid this from the American people.

01:00:02.117 --> 01:00:05.993
We need to know what this is and what
we're dealing with, and then we can help.

01:00:06.073 --> 01:00:08.251
Otherwise, you can go on your own.

01:00:08.331 --> 01:00:11.873
We don't have much time. From what we've
gathered, it's an antimatter generator.

01:00:11.953 --> 01:00:14.615
Antimatter and matter destroy
each other, turning into pure energy.

01:00:14.695 --> 01:00:17.756
It's many times more powerful
than even a hydrogen bomb.

01:00:20.079 --> 01:00:22.295
Then what is this?

01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:26.409
It's a countdown.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.409
All clear for now, but no guarantee
when they'll come back.

01:00:48.764 --> 01:00:52.065
Luke... get me that relay backup.

01:01:07.922 --> 01:01:10.175
Fireworks react with their armor.

01:01:10.255 --> 01:01:12.046
I think it's the potassium nitrate.

01:01:12.126 --> 01:01:15.956
Potassium nitrate is an oxidizer, and mixed
with gunpowder, it's highly reactive.

01:01:17.136 --> 01:01:19.941
<i>Copy you, Eagle One.
Are you in a secure location?</i>

01:01:20.021 --> 01:01:23.732
<i>We're tied down out here. I'll have to get
back to you with an ETA for extraction.</i>

01:01:23.812 --> 01:01:26.739
- <i>You hang tight, over.</i>
- Copy, Captain. Standing by.

01:01:26.819 --> 01:01:30.821
And, Captain, be advised...
their armor reacts to potassium nitrate.

01:01:30.901 --> 01:01:33.520
Potassium nitrate, do you copy? Over.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.647
<i>Copy that. We'll spread the word. Over.</i>

01:01:40.928 --> 01:01:42.798
What's that, Colonel?

01:01:43.328 --> 01:01:45.537
Sir, I'm sorry to report...

01:01:46.146 --> 01:01:48.206
...the device is now armed.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.058
- I can fix this.
- Wait, Luke, you did this?

01:01:57.138 --> 01:01:59.393
- We did this together.
- I leave you alone for one minute...

01:01:59.473 --> 01:02:02.286
Armed? What do you mean, "armed?"

01:02:02.366 --> 01:02:04.824
It's a... a countdown.

01:02:04.904 --> 01:02:08.474
- A countdown to what?
- It's a bomb.

01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:13.576
- How much time do we have?
- Less than an hour.

01:02:13.656 --> 01:02:17.767
An hour? Less than one hour?
You have to stop this!

01:02:17.847 --> 01:02:20.653
Calm down. That's what
we're working on right now.

01:02:20.733 --> 01:02:22.916
Your son and his friend here
will have to come with us.

01:02:22.996 --> 01:02:24.774
- Where are you going?
- To see the asset.

01:02:24.854 --> 01:02:28.092
- Patrick, is that your truck outside?
- Yeah.

01:02:28.172 --> 01:02:30.205
We're gonna need it.

01:03:22.629 --> 01:03:24.650
- Oh!
- Here you go.

01:03:39.246 --> 01:03:42.051
Smith. Is it safe?

01:03:44.693 --> 01:03:46.535
Looks clear.

01:04:13.193 --> 01:04:15.418
<i>Oh, no, no, no!</i>

01:04:21.766 --> 01:04:24.632
- Don't make any sudden movements.
- Why?

01:04:24.712 --> 01:04:26.865
We don't wanna startle him.

01:04:26.945 --> 01:04:28.693
It's a him?

01:04:28.773 --> 01:04:30.589
We call him Al.

01:04:31.123 --> 01:04:32.336
Okay.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.648
Okay, you guys, you better stay back.

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:47.094
Does it speak?

01:04:47.174 --> 01:04:50.600
Rudimentary, but we've rigged
a translator to its armor.

01:04:54.481 --> 01:04:58.401
Al... this is the President
of the United States.

01:04:58.481 --> 01:05:00.925
If you don't know already,
your kind are here now.

01:05:01.005 --> 01:05:03.487
They're coming for the device you gave us.

01:05:04.112 --> 01:05:06.221
We need your help.

01:05:06.301 --> 01:05:08.471
We need your help stopping them.

01:05:10.033 --> 01:05:11.887
Can he even hear us?

01:05:22.366 --> 01:05:23.912
Got your attention now.

01:05:24.959 --> 01:05:28.448
Remember this? This is what you gave us.

01:05:28.528 --> 01:05:31.735
We need your help in turning it against them.

01:05:32.175 --> 01:05:34.311
<i>It can only be used once.</i>

01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:36.039
We know that.

01:05:36.119 --> 01:05:39.586
If we use it, it would destroy everything.

01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:42.449
<i>By activating it now,
you risk destroying your planet.</i>

01:05:42.529 --> 01:05:45.444
- We don't want to activate it.
- <i>It has been activated.</i>

01:05:45.524 --> 01:05:48.551
We know! That's why we brought it to you.

01:05:49.331 --> 01:05:50.651
We wanna turn it off.

01:05:50.731 --> 01:05:52.760
<i>It cannot be done.</i>

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.110
You're the expert in this thing.

01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:58.178
There must be some way to turn it off.

01:05:58.258 --> 01:06:02.165
You shouldn't have taken the device
from me. I brought it here to destroy it.

01:06:02.245 --> 01:06:04.919
Al, that's why we took it from you.

01:06:04.999 --> 01:06:09.072
You brought a weapon to our planet.
What do you expect us to do?

01:06:09.152 --> 01:06:11.535
<i>Your people turned on the device.</i>

01:06:11.615 --> 01:06:14.046
<i>That's what sent out the beacon.</i>

01:06:14.126 --> 01:06:16.931
<i>That's what brought them here.</i>

01:06:19.884 --> 01:06:21.950
Maybe you should have given us
some type of warning.

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:26.811
<i>I did warn you, Mr. President.
I communicated with your scientists.</i>

01:06:26.891 --> 01:06:31.489
<i>I communicated with your Colonel Smith.
I told you everything I know...</i>

01:06:31.569 --> 01:06:35.559
<i>...about the device
and what it was designed to do.</i>

01:06:35.639 --> 01:06:39.423
<i>I warned you that we must
all work together to dismantle it...</i>

01:06:39.503 --> 01:06:43.561
<i>...and most of all
that it should never be turned on.</i>

01:06:46.332 --> 01:06:48.823
- Excuse me, Al...
- Hey, hey, whoa, hey.

01:06:49.788 --> 01:06:54.190
We didn't mean to activate it. It was
connecting to our network on its own.

01:06:55.423 --> 01:06:58.263
We didn't mean to start it.
We were just trying to take it out.

01:06:58.343 --> 01:07:01.148
Can it be deactivated?

01:07:01.228 --> 01:07:02.707
<i>It cannot.</i>

01:07:02.787 --> 01:07:07.833
<i>Once the countdown has begun,
there is no stopping it.</i>

01:07:09.038 --> 01:07:11.551
- You're certain of this?
- <i>That is correct.</i>

01:07:11.631 --> 01:07:14.679
<i>I designed the timer
that links to the trigger.</i>

01:07:14.759 --> 01:07:16.842
<i>It's a complicated device.</i>

01:07:16.922 --> 01:07:21.177
<i>Each of us designed a small
section of its development.</i>

01:07:21.257 --> 01:07:25.216
<i>It was designed in such a way,
in small sections...</i>

01:07:25.296 --> 01:07:29.534
<i>...that no single individual
could create the whole device...</i>

01:07:29.614 --> 01:07:31.601
<i>...or deactivate it.</i>

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:33.755
There must be something...

01:07:33.835 --> 01:07:36.709
...something you must know to help us.

01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:39.453
Something you may realize that is important.

01:07:41.081 --> 01:07:42.896
We need your help.

01:07:44.054 --> 01:07:47.952
<i>It is too late. It cannot be stopped.</i>

01:07:49.851 --> 01:07:53.083
<i>Better for your planet to be destroyed...</i>

01:07:53.163 --> 01:07:55.964
<i>...than to give it to them.</i>

01:07:58.111 --> 01:07:59.752
Al.

01:07:59.832 --> 01:08:03.525
Al, help us to stop this.

01:08:04.165 --> 01:08:07.460
<i>Better for your planet to be destroyed...</i>

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:10.151
<i>...than to give it to them.</i>

01:08:39.152 --> 01:08:43.015
<i>Colonel Smith, I am sorry.</i>

01:09:24.096 --> 01:09:25.993
So we can't stop it.

01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:29.939
Is that what you're saying?

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.124
We need to get out of here.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.318
We can't go back to the house
now, they know where it is.

01:09:52.398 --> 01:09:53.752
I got an idea.

01:10:14.986 --> 01:10:19.076
It doesn't matter where we are. When this
thing goes off, it'll take out everyone.

01:10:19.156 --> 01:10:21.407
The only way to stop them
is to use it against them.

01:10:21.487 --> 01:10:25.566
Can't you strap it to a missile or something?
Shoot it at the mothership?

01:10:25.646 --> 01:10:28.907
- We tried that.
- So that's it? It didn't work?

01:10:28.987 --> 01:10:30.535
Ma'am, we're not giving up.

01:10:30.615 --> 01:10:33.316
Please, can we just focus on figuring out
how to deactivate the device?

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.292
We don't have to deactivate it.
We can use it against them.

01:10:35.372 --> 01:10:38.393
- We've tried that.
- No, Mr. President, listen, please.

01:10:38.473 --> 01:10:41.241
Rachel and I saw a way
to get to the mothership.

01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:44.549
When we first encountered them,
we saw them using some kind of device...

01:10:44.629 --> 01:10:46.628
...that beamed them back
and forth to their ship.

01:10:46.708 --> 01:10:49.441
I took part of it off to disable it.
I thought it might slow the invasion.

01:10:49.521 --> 01:10:51.524
Maybe we can beam it back up to them.

01:10:51.604 --> 01:10:54.467
- Easy, easy.
- You remember how they worked it?

01:10:54.547 --> 01:10:58.729
Yes, sir, absolutely. I saw how they did it.
I saw their interface.

01:10:58.809 --> 01:11:02.693
Had a bunch of symbols.
Maybe together, we can make it work.

01:11:02.773 --> 01:11:06.641
Yeah, but isn't it dangerous that the bombs
would be exploding that close to the Earth?

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:08.555
What other option do we have?

01:11:16.078 --> 01:11:20.168
A person takes on the White House
to make a difference.

01:11:20.748 --> 01:11:23.584
You hope for that defining moment...

01:11:23.664 --> 01:11:26.034
...when the world is on the brink...

01:11:26.114 --> 01:11:28.359
...that you'll make that right decision.

01:11:29.839 --> 01:11:32.879
No president ever imagined this problem.

01:11:33.604 --> 01:11:36.315
No president could ever want this trouble.

01:11:37.939 --> 01:11:39.747
But here it is...

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:44.680
...and it's not me
who's gonna save the world.

01:11:45.498 --> 01:11:47.350
It's all of us.

01:11:48.292 --> 01:11:50.136
It's up to us.

01:11:50.646 --> 01:11:53.513
Maybe the last, best hope humanity has.

01:11:55.813 --> 01:11:58.057
No one can do it for us.

01:11:59.569 --> 01:12:01.513
Let's make the world proud.

01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:04.616
Let's go kill these suckers.

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:12.634
- Jump in the back.
- Okay.

01:12:13.539 --> 01:12:16.114
Honored to ride with you all.

01:12:16.194 --> 01:12:19.495
Without fireworks, we're gonna be
in serious trouble if we run into them.

01:12:19.575 --> 01:12:23.760
- We need to get more.
- Uh, I still have these.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.915
I know bottle rockets are kinda lame,
but better than nothing, right?

01:12:26.995 --> 01:12:28.538
Thanks.

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.788
You'll be safer here than out in the open.
Look, we'll be back in a jiffy.

01:12:31.868 --> 01:12:33.901
- I'm coming with you.
- No, no, you've got the weapons here.

01:12:33.981 --> 01:12:36.947
- I want you to stay here. We'll be back.
- I want us to be together.

01:12:37.027 --> 01:12:40.883
Listen, there's no point in separating now.

01:12:41.183 --> 01:12:44.489
I'm the commander-in-chief,
and I'm giving an executive order...

01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:47.592
...we're all staying together,
and that's that.

01:12:48.195 --> 01:12:51.470
- Well, if that's an order...
- It's a direct order, soldier.

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.888
You go up front with the device.

01:13:04.968 --> 01:13:06.785
Yes, sir.

01:13:28.792 --> 01:13:30.670
For all mankind.

01:13:32.369 --> 01:13:34.195
For all mankind.

01:13:41.396 --> 01:13:44.375
So how does this thing work?
You just beam it up, and that's it?

01:13:44.455 --> 01:13:46.472
Wish it were that easy.

01:13:48.751 --> 01:13:51.241
One of us needs to be there
to make sure they don't deactivate it.

01:13:56.424 --> 01:13:59.434
The one part of this device that we
really understand is the trigger.

01:13:59.514 --> 01:14:01.335
I got him.

01:14:06.029 --> 01:14:08.394
We can't stop the countdown,
but we can trigger the device.

01:14:08.474 --> 01:14:10.487
I got him.

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:12.379
Nice.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:18.739
We have to set it off manually,
it's the only way.

01:14:31.626 --> 01:14:33.467
We don't have much time.

01:14:34.984 --> 01:14:36.963
- It's up this way.
- We have to hurry.

01:14:37.043 --> 01:14:39.306
- How much time do we have?
- Minutes.

01:14:41.141 --> 01:14:42.985
Hold on.

01:15:02.955 --> 01:15:04.950
Teleporter is back here.

01:15:09.483 --> 01:15:10.987
Great.

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:34.116
- What are we waiting for?
- When I disabled it...

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:36.175
...I didn't actually take the part with me.

01:15:36.255 --> 01:15:39.772
But we can find it. It's... it's in those
woods somewhere, I threw it down there.

01:15:39.852 --> 01:15:42.896
- We're running out of time.
- Okay, well, let's go.

01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:47.584
You know how to use this, right? Okay.

01:16:00.764 --> 01:16:02.421
Got it.

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:08.069
Cover me, Mr. President!

01:16:08.984 --> 01:16:10.800
Luke, go long!

01:16:26.529 --> 01:16:29.974
Okay, this way. I got it from right here.

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:40.278
Okay, all clear.

01:16:40.358 --> 01:16:43.053
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:47.106
So we just grab on top, and then...

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:48.702
...push down.

01:16:48.782 --> 01:16:50.543
That's it?

01:16:50.623 --> 01:16:52.465
I think so.

01:17:07.609 --> 01:17:09.158
Smith.

01:17:11.531 --> 01:17:14.323
I wanna thank you
for your service to our country.

01:17:14.403 --> 01:17:17.031
You will be remembered. We really...

01:17:17.111 --> 01:17:18.971
Mr. President.

01:17:25.097 --> 01:17:26.987
Something's coming through.

01:17:34.293 --> 01:17:36.811
It's no use. The shot
didn't have an effect on it.

01:17:40.505 --> 01:17:41.808
Paige!

01:18:27.666 --> 01:18:28.840
The bomb?

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.139
- Does anyone else know how to use it?
- I do... it's an alphanumeric code.

01:18:32.219 --> 01:18:35.747
- We can set it to go off once I'm inside.
- No, you won't be able to get back.

01:18:35.827 --> 01:18:38.481
- Maybe not.
- Okay, I'm going. Show me how to do it.

01:18:38.561 --> 01:18:42.615
- We only get one shot at this.
- I'll go. It's my responsibility.

01:18:42.695 --> 01:18:45.718
No, Mr. President, somebody has to restart
this country when this is all over.

01:18:45.798 --> 01:18:47.620
It has to be me.

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.819
- Luke, show me how to do it.
- No!

01:18:49.899 --> 01:18:51.724
There has to be another way.

01:18:51.804 --> 01:18:55.012
- Let me do this!
- You are not going up there.

01:18:55.092 --> 01:18:58.322
- Mom, I need to fix this.
- I am not letting you go!

01:18:58.502 --> 01:19:02.200
- I can bring you back. I can bring him.
- This is not happening!

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.867
We're running out of time. I'll go!

01:19:04.947 --> 01:19:08.270
Then I'll go with you.
Luke, show me how to set it off.

01:19:08.951 --> 01:19:11.148
Luke, please.

01:19:11.228 --> 01:19:12.749
Please.

01:19:13.695 --> 01:19:16.485
- No. No.
- Hey...

01:19:16.565 --> 01:19:19.686
...we're coming back. Okay?

01:19:21.516 --> 01:19:23.568
Okay. Okay.

01:19:34.806 --> 01:19:37.950
Couldn't let you have all
the fun now, could I, Luke?

01:20:00.015 --> 01:20:01.845
How we doing, Luke?

01:20:05.077 --> 01:20:06.963
How we doing?

01:20:07.401 --> 01:20:08.885
I'm almost ready!

01:20:16.641 --> 01:20:18.679
Come on, Luke!

01:20:18.759 --> 01:20:20.632
I'm ready!

01:20:21.384 --> 01:20:23.155
Don't mess with humanity!

01:20:45.438 --> 01:20:46.945
I think they did it.

01:21:04.582 --> 01:21:06.639
Luke, Luke!

01:21:33.915 --> 01:21:36.371
Now these are some fireworks.

01:21:38.983 --> 01:21:41.445
Happy 4th of July, Mr. President.
