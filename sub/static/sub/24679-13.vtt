00:01.367 --> 00:03.905
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.971 --> 00:06.110
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.173 --> 00:08.915
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.614
These are their stories.

00:12.779 --> 00:15.316
How long was Mr. Richter your patient?

00:15.382 --> 00:16.827
A little over 10 years.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.230
It's imperative that I get in touch with him.

00:19.286 --> 00:22.165
This new information directly
impacts his condition.

00:22.222 --> 00:25.362
This new information you can't tell me about.

00:25.893 --> 00:28.100
You never did say what your specialty was.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.573
I'm a psychiatrist.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.443
And how did you find out
Mr. Richter was my patient?

00:35.502 --> 00:37.413
Did you snoop through confidential records?

00:37.471 --> 00:39.382
- Dr. Dysart...
- Dr. Roland,

00:39.439 --> 00:43.251
I think Mr. Richter probably had
good reason to stop seeing you.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.516
I need to see him, Mr. Garcia.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.926
I am his doctor.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.292
He's never mentioned you.

00:52.352 --> 00:54.127
Why don't we ask him? Is he here?

00:54.187 --> 00:57.725
Derek, this man needs to go.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.932
All right, all right, all right,
all right. Can I leave him a note?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.872
Jeff. Jeff. It's me, Michael.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.175
Hey. did you get my note?

01:09.236 --> 01:10.772
I don't want to talk to you.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.043
Do you still like steak?

01:12.105 --> 01:13.243
There's a place right over on Lexington...

01:13.307 --> 01:14.945
Listen, you just stay away.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.318
I faxed that note to Katherine B. Thompson.

01:17.377 --> 01:18.617
She's at the New York Times.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.488
You can tell me all about it right over...

01:20.547 --> 01:21.548
Don't touch me.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.458
Don't ever touch me!

01:25.118 --> 01:26.426
Jeff.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.659
If he ever touches me again, I'll kill him.

01:29.122 --> 01:31.102
DEREK: Come on, man, let's go back inside.

01:34.361 --> 01:35.840
Say goodbye to Grandma.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.967
I can't believe she's gone.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.904
It's just me now.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.910
You have us. You have Matthew.

ROLAND: Come on, Maisy, one
bush is as good as the next.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.187
(DOG BARKING)

01:58.952 --> 02:00.056
Tough doggie.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.399
(SIGHING) Finally.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.976
(DOG BARKING)

03:03.583 --> 03:05.221
HOLT: No wallet, no ID in the pocket.

03:05.285 --> 03:06.889
EAMES: You checked the dog tags?

03:06.953 --> 03:10.298
Oh, right. I'm waiting on that.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.528
Major Case catching muggings now, huh?

03:12.592 --> 03:14.538
Only the ones in the Mayor's backyard.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.198
We're ready for that witness.

03:16.496 --> 03:20.740
I count 11 knife wounds
to the chest, shoulders, neck.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.337
None on the hands or arms.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.344
No defensive wounds.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.681
He's got knife strikes coming
at him from all sides.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.481
He would have put his arms
up to protect himself.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.615
And look at the way he's
tangled up in these vines.

03:33.914 --> 03:37.862
(STUTTERING)
I don't know. This guy was disoriented.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.296
Maybe because somebody
was trying to kill him.

03:40.987 --> 03:43.866
Yeah, but he didn't do the things
that might have saved him.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.598
You found the body?

03:46.660 --> 03:49.573
Yeah, I was jogging. His
dog jumped out of the bushes.

03:49.629 --> 03:50.664
You ever seen him?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.870
Yeah, just before I decided
to turn around and go home,

03:52.933 --> 03:54.105
around 10:00.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.841
Is there a particular reason why
you turned around and went home?

03:56.903 --> 03:59.008
Lightning. Dry lightning.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.245
I caught a flash out of the corner of my eye.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.717
Right. Okay, thanks.

04:04.544 --> 04:07.923
I got an address for Maisy's owner.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.892
Dr. Michael Roland, over on York.

04:09.950 --> 04:10.951
Thanks.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.261
Dry lightning?

04:17.390 --> 04:21.338
In the park? Behind Gracie Mansion?

04:21.728 --> 04:24.072
Is that where he usually walks your dog?

04:24.131 --> 04:26.168
Yes. It's just so close.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.474
(SOBBING)
Oh, my God, Michael.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.649
We're very sorry.

04:33.273 --> 04:37.016
He ever mention any problems with his
psychiatric patients, any threats?

04:37.077 --> 04:38.181
No.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.854
GOREN: What did you think when
your husband didn't come home?

04:42.249 --> 04:44.058
I didn't know what to think.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.625
Did you think that he wasn't walking the dog?

04:51.024 --> 04:53.061
He'd been out of the office a lot,

04:53.126 --> 04:55.504
in the mornings, or in the
middle of the afternoon.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.341
He always had an excuse.

04:59.366 --> 05:02.040
People have been coming over, bringing food.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.673
Yes. My mother passed away.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.342
The service was two days ago.

05:07.274 --> 05:10.414
Well, that must've been very
stressful for you and your husband.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.416
Yes. Yes, it was.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.762
I don't know what problems
Dr. Roland was having at home,

05:23.824 --> 05:26.168
but I can guarantee
he was not having an affair.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.103
I'm not opening these files.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.971
And I'm not giving you
the password for his computer.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.773
Dr. Roland would want his
patients' privacy protected.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.007
Even if one of his patients
tried to kill him?

05:36.069 --> 05:38.049
His patients are neurotic, not psychotic.

05:38.104 --> 05:41.017
You logged on to his computer this
morning, after we called you.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.111
- I did not.
- Says right here you did.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.985
See, I can't open his folders,

05:45.045 --> 05:48.026
but I can get a record of
when somebody last logged on.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.157
So you, what?

05:54.221 --> 05:57.395
You tried to erase his stash
of dirty little pictures?

05:58.525 --> 05:59.936
Compromising e-mails?

05:59.993 --> 06:01.028
Absolutely not.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.540
Maybe she erased her own naughty things.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.069
Were you having a...

06:06.266 --> 06:08.405
you know, fooling around with Dr. Roland?

06:09.536 --> 06:11.413
I didn't erase anything.

06:16.243 --> 06:19.281
His lawyer told me to save
everything till he could look at it.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.620
There.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.887
That e-mail from Dr. Roland's
internet server.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.087
"To user M. Roland,

06:24.150 --> 06:26.357
"the New York Attorney General's
office has notified us

06:26.419 --> 06:29.093
"of your unauthorized
attempts to access NYMEDD."

06:29.155 --> 06:30.725
That's the Medicaid database.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.896
He was trying to hack into it?

06:35.795 --> 06:37.399
Medicaid said Roland was looking

06:37.464 --> 06:39.637
for the records of somebody
named Jeff Richter.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.770
Roland's secretary's never heard of him.

06:41.835 --> 06:42.836
Have we?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.213
There's a Jeff Richter with the
same social security number

06:45.272 --> 06:46.683
Roland used for his search.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.617
He's got a three-year-old assault charge.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.120
- Bring him in.
- Easier said.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.450
His last known's no good.

06:51.511 --> 06:55.357
BCI doesn't have them.
Neither does the DMV, Con Ed...

06:55.982 --> 06:59.122
Look what he gives as his
occupation when he was booked.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.658
"De-programmed CIA assassin."

07:01.721 --> 07:03.257
This guy's got problems.

07:03.323 --> 07:06.463
He doesn't want to be found.
Probably resents people who try.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.903
Well, he'd better get over it.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.999
Put an APB out to the homeless shelters.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.600
Right.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.169
Okay, all right, thank you.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.580
The weather service says no
reports of lightning last night.

07:22.008 --> 07:25.979
When did Roland hack the Medicaid database?

07:29.149 --> 07:30.992
About three months ago.

07:32.852 --> 07:34.354
It's right after his mother-in-law

07:34.421 --> 07:36.162
was diagnosed with cancer.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.799
GARCIA: Derek saw him just before 9:00.

07:40.860 --> 07:44.307
He was going up to his room.
Nobody saw him after that.

07:44.364 --> 07:47.538
They say the doctor was stabbed 11 times.

07:48.702 --> 07:52.172
He can do that. You know he can do that.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.780
I know.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.186
We have to protect ourselves.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.412
Derek and me will take care of it.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.685
Don't worry.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.219
Work will go on.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.801
Cinderblock. I know Cinderblock rooms.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.494
How many floors underground are we?

08:11.558 --> 08:14.835
We're 11 floors up, Jeff. Didn't you
see the buttons on the elevator?

08:14.894 --> 08:17.602
Up is down. Down is up. I know the tricks.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.734
You're him. He's you.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.106
And who's he?

08:20.734 --> 08:21.838
I don't know him.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.040
You don't know Michael Roland,
your own brother-in-law?

08:24.104 --> 08:25.947
Oh, I know that guy.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.679
But that's a facsimile of that guy.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.984
North Koreans have been turning
out facsimiles for years.

08:31.044 --> 08:34.787
When's the last time you saw this facsimile?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.293
Last week at the Garcia House.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.486
He gave me a note about a funeral.

08:37.549 --> 08:38.961
Your mother's funeral.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.554
The whole thing was a trap.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.464
You lived at the Garcia House on 117th?

08:46.526 --> 08:49.769
Yeah, before the facsimile blew my cover.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.833
They asked me to leave so
innocent people wouldn't be hurt.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.140
That's the price you pay
when you work for the CIA.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.772
You were still at Garcia
House Thursday night?

08:57.837 --> 09:00.477
Yes. I ate spaghetti.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.383
I had a smoke on the stoop and I went to bed.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.046
EAMES: Anybody see you on that stoop?

09:04.110 --> 09:06.818
Millions of people. It's a big city.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.053
No, I see what you're doing, Jeff.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.956
You're using backward logic.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.533
Like, only sick people take pills,

09:17.590 --> 09:20.161
so if I stop taking pills, I...

09:20.493 --> 09:21.870
I won't be sick.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.339
You follow?

09:23.563 --> 09:25.668
- I take my pills.
- Yes.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.177
You didn't have anything on you

09:27.233 --> 09:29.042
when they picked you up at the shelter.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.877
And we looked up your Medicaid account.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.678
No charges in over a year.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.480
That's a lie. I take my pills.

09:34.541 --> 09:35.952
See for yourself.

09:46.519 --> 09:49.864
You know, I know it's hard
to stay on your meds.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.127
It's like your head is,

09:52.392 --> 09:54.736
you know, wrapped in a wet blanket.

09:54.794 --> 09:59.800
But if you go off, then, well,
that's when the trouble starts.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.411
Most schizophrenics aren't violent.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.711
But sometimes you are.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.009
That's why they asked you
to leave Garcia House?

10:08.074 --> 10:10.020
It was to protect the innocent.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.920
From you. Because you were starting fights.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.186
I was not. I take my meds.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.250
Geodon. I take Geodon.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.059
Come on, Jeff. You even got
into a fight Thursday night.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.292
You went for a walk.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.594
I don't go out nights.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.464
You ran into Michael and his dog.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.060
I tell you, I don't go out at night.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.366
It's too dark. I don't like it.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.138
I like your socks.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.843
Where'd you get them?

10:34.834 --> 10:36.245
The mission.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.710
Lucky you found a matching pair.

10:41.541 --> 10:42.747
Yeah.

10:50.550 --> 10:53.463
He squints. He doesn't
like going out at night.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.564
He can't distinguish shades.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.797
He's got nyctalopia, night blindness.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.668
He wouldn't have attacked Roland at night,

11:01.728 --> 11:03.264
he would've waited for daytime.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.967
Maybe under normal circumstances,

11:05.031 --> 11:07.068
but this guy hasn't taken
his meds in over a year.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.305
Well, that's another thing.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.144
Geodon only came out on the market last year.

11:11.204 --> 11:14.242
The only way he'd know about
it is if he was taking it.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.150
His fairy godmother must be paying for it

11:16.209 --> 11:18.246
because there's no record Medicaid is.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.814
There's no record of Richter
anywhere this past year.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.518
He took himself off the radar.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.193
More than likely someone else did.

11:26.152 --> 11:28.723
My bet, it wasn't the North Koreans.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.768
Richter applied for a new social
security number last year.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.308
He said he was being stalked.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.469
That's his supporting documentation.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.480
Five pages, typed, single
spaced. I think he had help.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.743
Medicaid ran his new social security number.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.250
Besides his meds,

11:47.307 --> 11:50.254
they pay for his chiropractor twice a week,

11:50.310 --> 11:52.381
his dentist, once a week,

11:52.445 --> 11:56.757
eye doctor, art therapy,
podiatrist, dermatologist.

11:56.816 --> 11:59.057
That guy's sicker than he looks.

11:59.118 --> 12:00.461
Let's find out.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.827
(DOOR BUZZING)

12:04.791 --> 12:06.737
Jeff, how you feeling?

12:07.493 --> 12:08.494
Pretty good.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.539
How's your sciatica?

12:11.030 --> 12:14.443
Medicaid says you see a chiropractor

12:14.500 --> 12:18.676
for sciatica nerve problems in your left leg.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.376
Oh, that's all better.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.713
Your feet? Says here you see a...

12:24.544 --> 12:25.648
Podiatrist.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.253
I have bad arches.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.728
Can we see your feet?

12:39.892 --> 12:41.803
These dogs don't look so bad.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.175
What else does your doctor do
besides clean your feet?

12:45.698 --> 12:47.041
Nothing.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.670
My arches still hurt. I told Mr. Garcia.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.946
Still, you have to admit,
my feet look pretty good.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.981
They should, at $500 bucks a visit.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.626
GARCIA: I had a chat with that doctor.

13:04.684 --> 13:09.497
Our medical advisory board said his
fees and methods were pretty standard.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.236
This is your advisory board here?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.965
And lots of heavy hitters.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.768
LUPE: How's Jeff?

13:16.963 --> 13:20.069
We've been so worried about
him since he ran away.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.672
He told us he was asked to leave.

13:23.369 --> 13:26.043
We don't turn anybody away.

13:27.373 --> 13:29.353
When we bring people in off the street,

13:29.409 --> 13:32.481
we make them a promise,
they'll always have a home.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.954
And you served spaghetti
for dinner Thursday night?

13:37.016 --> 13:38.154
That sounds right.

13:38.217 --> 13:41.323
And after dinner Jeff likes
to have a smoke on the stoop.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.367
I kind of lost track of Jeff that night.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.562
We don't do bed checks,

13:46.059 --> 13:48.562
so all I can say is, I don't...
I didn't see him.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.437
And what about you, Mrs. Garcia?

13:50.830 --> 13:53.140
I was upstairs in our rooms.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.269
All right.

13:56.336 --> 14:01.081
GOREN: Well, so, maybe Jeff was here,

14:01.140 --> 14:03.416
you know, maybe he wasn't.

14:03.943 --> 14:05.445
Did he do any of these?

14:06.279 --> 14:07.656
No. Our other residents.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.921
We take them to art therapy twice a week.

14:10.416 --> 14:15.058
Oh. Emily LeCroix, what
was she diagnosed with?

14:16.723 --> 14:18.066
Schizophrenia.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.899
- GOREN: Really?
- Yes.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.669
It's a wonderful painting, so full of hope.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.907
Well, it certainly is, um,

14:29.168 --> 14:31.808
you know, full of something.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.347
That's my favorite.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.247
Carol James.

14:37.276 --> 14:38.448
Let me guess.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.014
The lady has bipolar disorder.

14:43.516 --> 14:47.328
My mother's roommate at
Carmel Ridge, she's bipolar.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.593
She paints fruit, too.

14:48.654 --> 14:53.228
But, you know, bright blue
apples, hot pink bananas.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.340
(STAMMERING) Her paintings are raw.
They're filled with energy.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.969
She's driven to express herself.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.271
I didn't see any of that in that painting.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.939
And the kids on the beach?

15:04.003 --> 15:05.812
Well, schizophrenics are...

15:05.872 --> 15:07.852
Well, they typically focus on the eyes.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.285
Would have been the
children's eyes, the dog's.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.916
No, I think the Garcias probably bought
those paintings at a garage sale.

15:13.980 --> 15:17.826
The Garcias charged Medicaid $200 bucks
a week for Jeff's art therapy classes.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.955
Plus $50 bucks transportation.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.872
You feel like sticking around
for their next field trip?

15:32.131 --> 15:33.701
They drove around for half an hour

15:33.766 --> 15:35.609
and then went back to Garcia House.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.113
Well, they let one of them out.

15:37.170 --> 15:40.117
He had to go to the bathroom, so they
let him take a pee off the pier.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.380
Off the pier? That's compassion.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.682
EAMES: Compassion has its rewards.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.451
At $50 bucks a head, the
Garcias can charge Medicaid

15:46.512 --> 15:48.992
$800 bucks for transportation.

15:49.048 --> 15:51.494
If there is fraud
and Dr. Roland found out...

15:51.551 --> 15:54.862
Well, the Garcias could have had one
of their counselors take care of him.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.795
If fraud there is.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.767
What do you call Jeff
Richter's $500 pedicures?

16:01.828 --> 16:04.604
The art classes he doesn't
remember attending?

16:04.664 --> 16:07.668
That's your star witness, Jeff Richter,
the one-time murder suspect?

16:07.733 --> 16:09.735
You'd use him to impugn the characters

16:09.802 --> 16:11.145
of two advocates of the homeless

16:11.204 --> 16:13.081
who've earned the respect
of the people of this city?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.641
We've seen their press clippings.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.846
Good. I won't go near a grand jury

16:16.909 --> 16:21.289
if your only evidence is the ramblings
of a lone, deranged individual.

16:23.115 --> 16:26.585
How about the ramblings
of 10 deranged individuals?

16:32.225 --> 16:33.863
What the hell did you get me into?

16:34.093 --> 16:35.936
You lumped me in with those quacks.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.272
I'm just saying, Doc, everybody's
got to get their stories straight.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.505
My patients need to continue their treatment.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.240
Which brings me to my last point,

16:43.302 --> 16:45.839
your last state check should have come in.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.282
You need to settle up.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.217
How much do you want?

16:51.277 --> 16:53.780
What the hell are you doing?
I can't take a personal check.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.053
A money order, Doc, same as always.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.791
I have a patient waiting.

17:03.322 --> 17:06.769
You're Emily LeCroix. I saw
your painting at the Garcia House,

17:06.826 --> 17:08.567
the kids on the beach with the dog.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.198
No, I didn't do that.

17:11.497 --> 17:15.707
Well, Mrs. Garcia said you painted
that at your art therapy class.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.009
No. I don't like dogs at all.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.775
Do you take art therapy classes?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.483
Oh, yes. I went last Saturday.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.685
What do you do in these classes?

17:27.079 --> 17:28.615
We painted an office.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.252
You mean you painted a mural on a wall?

17:31.317 --> 17:33.888
Well, sure, we painted the walls.
We painted them white.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.660
But Mr. Garcia said that's
what his friend wanted,

17:37.990 --> 17:39.025
white walls.

17:39.091 --> 17:43.437
Is that what they have you do
in these classes, paint walls?

17:44.564 --> 17:48.034
And ceilings. It's very therapeutic.

17:51.137 --> 17:52.480
Thanks, Emily.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.612
Let's hear what the others have to say.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.255
This is Mr. Biagiotti.

17:59.312 --> 18:02.020
Tell them where they take you
every week for drama therapy.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.357
Downtown to watch a show.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.725
Tell them what kind of show.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.628
You know, a TV show.

18:08.754 --> 18:12.634
Care to know how much the Garcias
charge Medicaid for this drama therapy?

18:13.392 --> 18:14.871
I can only guess.

18:15.194 --> 18:19.665
Mr. Biagiotti told me the Garcias had
him change his social security number.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.675
You'll have warrants by the end of the day.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.246
I don't care what this says. You can't
come in like this. Our residents...

18:27.306 --> 18:29.286
That's why we brought the
Department of Health with us.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.413
Is Mrs. Garcia upstairs?
What do you want with my wife?

18:31.477 --> 18:32.979
We have an arrest warrant for her.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.786
We have one for you, too.

18:39.485 --> 18:40.793
What is this?

18:40.853 --> 18:42.730
Mrs. Garcia, you're under arrest.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.096
Put your hands behind your back.

18:44.156 --> 18:47.160
(STUTTERING) Why are you doing this
to me? I am Lupe Garcia.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.899
This is an injustice.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.976
If I wasn't seeing this with my own eyes...

18:53.633 --> 18:56.739
Well, human misery pays well.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.677
Mr. and Mrs. Garcia did not
go out last Thursday night.

19:04.744 --> 19:05.984
That's for a fact.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.414
You're very sure of this fact.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.587
Mr. Garcia was in this
office from 8:10 to 10:27.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.097
Lupe went upstairs at 9:14.

19:14.553 --> 19:17.033
EAMES: What about Derek
and the other counselors?

19:17.089 --> 19:21.003
Derek Ortiz, certified in special
needs care, punched out at 10:15.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.182
Something wrong with your eyes, Reggie?

19:32.238 --> 19:34.184
I had a recent intraocular scraping.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.344
(WATCH BEEPING)

19:35.408 --> 19:36.512
Cataracts?

19:37.076 --> 19:38.282
Yes.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.686
You take Geodon?

19:42.748 --> 19:46.924
Mmm-hmm. By prescription only.
For my schizophrenia.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.102
Okay, Reggie, thanks.

19:55.394 --> 19:56.498
Okay.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.837
Well, that makes 15.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.778
Fifteen residents with eye problems.

20:03.836 --> 20:07.306
Jeff Richter, Mr. Biagiotti from the park,

20:07.373 --> 20:08.681
Reggie...

20:09.575 --> 20:11.646
All of them schizophrenics.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.486
I've just been upstairs.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.287
Tell me I was imagining things.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.758
The faucets really are gold plated.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.392
It's disillusioning, to say the least.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.196
On the bright side, everybody
on staff is accounted for

20:24.256 --> 20:25.894
the night Dr. Roland was killed.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.598
The Garcias might be thieves
but they aren't murderers.

20:29.528 --> 20:33.271
The doctors the Garcias used in their scheme,

20:34.633 --> 20:37.170
they switched them up every six months or so,

20:38.471 --> 20:40.542
except for the eye doctors.

20:42.541 --> 20:45.317
They've used the same one
for the last 3 years.

20:45.377 --> 20:48.449
A Dr. Thomas Dysart.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.895
Maybe he was actually treating these people.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.029
Well, they don't seem better off for it.

20:58.724 --> 21:03.537
When Dr. Roland hacked into
Jeff Richter's Medicaid files,

21:04.430 --> 21:06.535
did we find out how far he got?

21:12.238 --> 21:14.844
Jeff Richter? Yes, he is a patient.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.545
But I'd have to look up his file.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.646
We have his Medicaid file right here.

21:18.711 --> 21:22.454
This $3,500 charge last September,
what's this code mean?

21:23.048 --> 21:24.925
That's for cataract surgery.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.520
Cataract surgery?

21:26.852 --> 21:31.460
Isn't that the same code as this
procedure here, back in June?

21:31.824 --> 21:34.270
Two cataract surgeries in one year?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.663
One for each eye.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.506
GOREN: I told her you'd have a
logical explanation for that.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.513
Now, are you a fan,

21:44.570 --> 21:49.076
or are these up here to convince your
patients they have eye problems?

21:49.809 --> 21:52.483
I put them up to invite ridiculous questions.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.547
Now, I have a patient in five minutes.

21:54.613 --> 21:57.219
There's a charge here
for another surgery in March.

21:57.283 --> 21:59.490
Which eye was that for, Doctor?

22:00.252 --> 22:02.357
That's for a pre-op exam.

22:02.588 --> 22:03.999
You people don't know how lucky you are

22:04.056 --> 22:05.501
not having to deal with Medicaid.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.697
They assign a set fee for a procedure

22:07.760 --> 22:10.297
which has nothing to do with the actual cost.

22:10.362 --> 22:12.239
You're saying you overcharge Medicaid?

22:12.398 --> 22:15.504
No. My billing service sends them an invoice

22:15.568 --> 22:17.104
with all the bells and whistles.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.446
They lowball me. We negotiate.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.349
And I eventually get paid a fair price.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.920
I told her there was a logical
explanation for that, too.

22:28.581 --> 22:31.960
And that's the reason why there
are multiple surgery charges

22:32.017 --> 22:34.759
for your patients at Garcia House.

22:35.621 --> 22:37.225
Garcia House?

22:38.090 --> 22:39.228
Yes.

22:39.725 --> 22:42.672
The homeless are particularly
susceptible to eye problems

22:42.728 --> 22:46.039
because of diet, hygiene, drug use...

22:46.098 --> 22:48.578
But I really don't have
to justify my work to you.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.010
Well, you just did.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.708
You know, speaking for myself,

22:55.040 --> 22:56.644
I'm satisfied.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.746
That's an $8,000 piece
of equipment, Detective.

22:58.811 --> 22:59.915
Don't play with it.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.788
I've always wondered what this was.

23:01.847 --> 23:03.849
It's a transilluminator,
to check pupillary reflex.

23:03.916 --> 23:07.386
Was Dr. Roland satisfied
with your explanation?

23:08.721 --> 23:11.201
Roland? Never heard of him.

23:11.257 --> 23:12.827
Jeff Richter was his brother-in-law.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.031
Dr. Roland was looking for him.

23:15.094 --> 23:18.974
Roland tried to hack into
Jeff's medical files.

23:20.299 --> 23:24.577
He managed to download the
charges for the eye treatments

23:24.637 --> 23:26.878
before he got booted off.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.483
Sorry. Never talked to him.

23:37.549 --> 23:38.926
What goes in there?

23:40.552 --> 23:41.895
Nothing.

23:44.823 --> 23:48.270
We bought this at a medical supply
store. It's called a glare tester.

23:48.327 --> 23:51.035
That's what was missing
from Dysart's office.

23:51.096 --> 23:54.634
It gives off a bright light
to test the retina's response.

23:54.833 --> 23:57.370
And Dysart used this to blind Dr. Roland?

23:57.436 --> 23:59.712
That's why Roland couldn't defend himself.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.979
Now, this jogger confused

24:02.041 --> 24:04.817
this bright light with dry lightning.

24:05.978 --> 24:09.016
And Dysart probably damaged
his in the attack,

24:09.515 --> 24:11.517
so he had to get rid of it.

24:11.583 --> 24:15.156
That's the "how." I don't
quite see the "why."

24:15.788 --> 24:19.861
Even if Dr. Roland discovered
he was defrauding Medicaid...

24:19.925 --> 24:23.600
by performing cataract surgeries.
Isn't that assault?

24:23.662 --> 24:26.871
First degree, no less, being
in furtherance of a felony...

24:26.932 --> 24:29.879
Dysart knew he was facing serious prison time.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.944
What actual evidence do you
have to tie him to the murder?

24:35.607 --> 24:38.486
He lives alone, no one
saw him coming or going.

24:38.544 --> 24:40.717
We could canvass the park again.

24:40.779 --> 24:43.692
In the meantime, we'll build
an assault and fraud case,

24:43.749 --> 24:45.820
have our own doctors examine his patients,

24:45.884 --> 24:47.591
and talk to his billing service.

24:49.054 --> 24:51.933
Tom, I'm your malpractice attorney.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.629
This is beyond my field of...

24:53.692 --> 24:56.832
I hate when you equivocate, Norman.

24:59.398 --> 25:03.039
You will most certainly be charged
as an accomplice to the Garcias.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.410
But it gets worse,

25:04.470 --> 25:06.245
since you performed surgery on these people.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.649
I'm not guilty, Norman.

25:08.707 --> 25:11.950
Of course not. But you're
open to assault charges,

25:12.011 --> 25:15.925
unless you can demonstrate that the
procedures are medically legitimate.

25:15.981 --> 25:17.324
They are!

25:18.183 --> 25:21.494
The patients are undergoing a
legitimate course of treatment.

25:21.587 --> 25:22.588
Results.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.301
You have to prove it with results.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.030
Beneficial results.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.871
You mean, someone who's
completed the treatment.

25:30.929 --> 25:34.877
Yes. A success story. Can you do that?

25:39.138 --> 25:41.243
Dr. Dysart sent us the worksheets

25:41.306 --> 25:42.512
with the procedures checked off.

25:42.574 --> 25:45.646
I had no way of telling if he
actually performed those procedures.

25:45.711 --> 25:49.853
She's not trained to do medical
oversight. She's just a bookkeeper.

25:49.915 --> 25:52.156
Dysart gave us a cock and bull story

25:52.217 --> 25:54.697
about Medicaid lowballing his fees.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.397
No, he's right.

25:56.455 --> 26:00.232
When I took over his billing, I noticed
he was being shortchanged on his fees.

26:02.628 --> 26:05.837
It was your idea to inflate
the charges to Medicaid?

26:06.799 --> 26:10.008
It's standard practice
to negotiate for every nickel.

26:11.403 --> 26:15.510
Dr. Dysart must have been thrilled
you came up with this idea.

26:15.974 --> 26:17.749
I don't think he cared.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.218
Getting paid wasn't a priority.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.725
He was always late getting
his worksheets to me.

26:23.348 --> 26:27.797
He was probably too busy moving
patients in and out of his office.

26:29.154 --> 26:32.567
I'd be surprised if he saw
more than 10 patients a day.

26:32.624 --> 26:33.898
My other eye doctors,

26:33.959 --> 26:35.961
they see that many patients in an hour.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.503
You gotta hear this.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.377
Dr. Emerson was just giving us his report

26:46.438 --> 26:49.282
on Dysart's Garcia House patients.

26:49.708 --> 26:50.982
Go ahead, Doctor.

26:51.410 --> 26:55.153
I examined the 15 residents
Dysart operated on.

26:55.547 --> 26:59.085
These individuals were subjected
to repeated and needless

26:59.451 --> 27:01.954
retinal, corneal, and cataract surgeries

27:02.020 --> 27:03.795
for a period of over two years.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.996
Some had as many as 18
procedures during that time.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.504
With what results?

27:08.827 --> 27:11.307
Five have permanently detached retinas,

27:11.830 --> 27:13.605
others have diminished vision,

27:13.665 --> 27:16.271
oversensitivity to light, night blindness.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.111
They all have surgical scars
on top of surgical scars.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.878
They got laser cuts going nowhere.

27:20.939 --> 27:24.648
Dysart said these people had unique eye
problems because they'd been homeless.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.758
I don't care if these people
were living on Mars.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.157
In my experience,

27:30.215 --> 27:32.991
there is no medical justification for this...

27:33.051 --> 27:35.088
This butchery.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.156
You made your point, Doctor. Thank you.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.864
Where are we on the murder?

27:44.930 --> 27:48.400
We canvassed the park, we showed his
photo around, we fanned on every pitch.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.707
But we still have him on fraud

27:49.768 --> 27:51.247
and for assaulting these poor bastards.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.907
CARVER: He could simply claim incompetence

27:52.971 --> 27:55.178
and hide behind his malpractice insurance.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.686
We need proof he intended to defraud.

27:57.743 --> 28:00.189
You're talking about making
a deal with the Garcias.

28:00.245 --> 28:02.020
Not a generous deal, but a deal.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.753
If it gets us Dysart.

28:06.785 --> 28:08.560
Greedy son of a bitch.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.598
It's worse than that. I don't
think he did it for money.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.614
CARVER: These are the doctors' statements
about the kickbacks to the Garcias.

28:25.671 --> 28:28.515
This is from a livery service
whose offices were painted

28:28.574 --> 28:30.645
by the residents of the Garcia House

28:30.709 --> 28:32.916
under the guise of art therapy.

28:33.078 --> 28:35.490
And this is from the staff

28:35.547 --> 28:38.153
about field trips to parking lots.

28:39.585 --> 28:43.328
You have your statements, we have ours.

28:44.156 --> 28:46.602
From mental health advocates, civic leaders,

28:46.658 --> 28:49.571
all testifying to the fact that
hundreds of mentally disabled persons

28:49.628 --> 28:52.165
have been helped by the Garcias.

28:52.231 --> 28:56.145
There are words and then there are pictures.

28:57.736 --> 29:02.116
This is the work of your
ophthalmologist, Dr. Dysart.

29:10.382 --> 29:11.656
GOREN: You see this?

29:15.053 --> 29:16.191
You see that?

29:16.255 --> 29:20.328
That's Emily LeCroix's left eye, post-op.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.366
That scar tissue is from three operations

29:24.429 --> 29:26.466
in less than six months.

29:27.099 --> 29:31.445
Thanks to Dr. Dysart, she's
legally blind in that eye.

29:32.337 --> 29:34.214
This is Jeff Richter's eye.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.548
Dysart didn't wait for his scars
to heal from one operation

29:37.609 --> 29:39.316
before operating on him again.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.449
So now he needs corneal transplants.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.588
Dios. We didn't know that he was doing this.

29:45.651 --> 29:47.562
Mrs. Garcia, wait.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.428
What do you want from my clients?

29:49.488 --> 29:50.933
GOREN: Dysart.

29:51.189 --> 29:54.068
You help us prosecute him,
I'll consider a plea.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.164
First, I hear what they have to say.

29:58.997 --> 30:02.274
He was just supposed to examine them.

30:02.901 --> 30:04.471
I told him not to hurt them.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.441
Where'd you find Dysart?

30:06.905 --> 30:10.614
He came to me at a mental health benefit.

30:10.676 --> 30:13.316
He'd heard about our work with schizophrenics

30:13.545 --> 30:15.183
and offered his services.

30:16.081 --> 30:18.357
He specifically mentioned schizophrenics?

30:18.684 --> 30:19.924
Yeah.

30:20.719 --> 30:23.563
He asked me how many diagnosed schizophrenics

30:23.622 --> 30:25.568
were living at the house.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.099
Did he say why he was interested?

30:28.393 --> 30:32.102
No. He just wanted to work
with us, any way he could.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.166
If you want their testimony against Dysart,

30:34.232 --> 30:37.304
you'll reduce the charges
to misdemeanor larceny,

30:37.436 --> 30:39.040
they'll pay a fine,

30:39.104 --> 30:43.211
they'll retain their license
to operate Garcia House.

30:45.444 --> 30:46.821
I can't accept their terms.

30:46.878 --> 30:49.017
Dysart's a sadist with a medical license.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.890
Looks to me he's the greater of two evils.

30:50.949 --> 30:52.951
I want to put them all behind bars.

30:53.018 --> 30:56.329
That means making a case against
Dysart without the Garcias' help.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.766
Everything his bookkeeper tells us

30:58.824 --> 31:01.236
demonstrates Dysart's indifferent to money.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.273
He's in it for the joy of healing?

31:03.328 --> 31:04.932
I'm not sure.

31:04.996 --> 31:06.566
He targets schizophrenics.

31:06.631 --> 31:08.508
Because they're easy prey.

31:08.900 --> 31:11.676
So is any mentally ill person.

31:11.737 --> 31:14.843
But schizophrenics, more
than any other group,

31:14.906 --> 31:17.250
are more prone to visual hallucinations.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.846
You're not suggesting
that this was an experiment?

31:19.911 --> 31:22.892
You eliminate greed and sadism, what's left?

31:22.948 --> 31:26.623
Experimental surgery without informed
consent, without supervision,

31:26.685 --> 31:28.426
that's good for a trip up the river.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.296
Get me the evidence.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.062
Well, you don't do research

31:32.124 --> 31:33.569
without a theory to back it up.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.902
He might've published
a paper in a medical journal

31:36.962 --> 31:39.272
or talked it up with a colleague.

31:44.803 --> 31:48.182
I haven't spoken to Tom
since Columbia, 10 years ago.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.742
I wouldn't know about his research.

31:49.808 --> 31:51.446
You might try someone who's more current.

31:51.510 --> 31:52.648
We couldn't find anybody.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.748
We only came to you because
he used you as a reference

31:54.813 --> 31:57.316
when he applied to the
Ophthalmological Association.

31:57.382 --> 31:59.589
Ophthalmology? You sure?

31:59.951 --> 32:02.397
That wasn't his specialty when you knew him?

32:02.454 --> 32:05.128
No. It was oncology, same as me.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.296
He lose interest?

32:07.359 --> 32:08.963
I have no idea.

32:09.027 --> 32:11.633
We had one year left.
I spent the summer in Boston.

32:11.696 --> 32:13.266
When I came back, he was gone.

32:13.331 --> 32:15.038
They said he took a sabbatical.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.374
What did he say?

32:16.435 --> 32:17.914
PETERSON: I never talked to him.

32:17.969 --> 32:19.880
I didn't even know where he was.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.578
Then, a year later, he got in touch with me.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.520
Let me guess. He was in Amsterdam.

32:25.577 --> 32:28.217
This is from the Van Gogh
Museum. It's on the back.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.318
PETERSON: He sent me that
as a graduation gift.

32:31.983 --> 32:33.394
Never heard from him again.

32:37.322 --> 32:41.236
And he never expressed
an interest in ophthalmology?

32:41.293 --> 32:42.431
No.

32:42.494 --> 32:45.134
Maybe when he was smoking
that legal weed in Amsterdam,

32:45.197 --> 32:47.734
he figured out eye doctors have
a better chance of getting laid

32:47.799 --> 32:48.937
than oncologists.

32:50.735 --> 32:53.511
I don't think he was in
Amsterdam for the weed.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.076
DYSART: Look up for me, please.

32:58.043 --> 33:01.354
Good. Now look to the left. Okay.

33:01.413 --> 33:05.987
Dr. Dysart, I'm not sure
I understood you on the phone.

33:06.051 --> 33:08.395
Marilyn's going into the
next phase of her treatment.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.528
It's all covered by her Medicaid.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.695
Are you still on Zyprexa, Marilyn?

33:13.758 --> 33:15.897
My eyes are okay, Dr. Dysart.

33:15.961 --> 33:18.908
It's been two years since
she's had any blurriness.

33:18.964 --> 33:20.375
It's a multiphase treatment.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.275
If we stop now, she'll never get better.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.372
I assume you want Marilyn
to get better, don't you?

33:27.739 --> 33:30.652
EAMES: Columbia just faxed Dysart's records.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.689
When he came back from his year off,

33:32.744 --> 33:35.748
he doubled his workload to complete
his requirements for ophthalmology.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.760
Finished in the top percentile.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.288
He spent most of his sabbatical in Amsterdam.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.832
He gave Columbia an address at a hotel there.

33:43.388 --> 33:46.995
On Paulus Potterstraat. That's the same
street as the Van Gogh Museum.

33:47.225 --> 33:51.139
Maybe Dysart was thinking of
becoming a reconstructive surgeon.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.039
The story is,

33:54.099 --> 33:57.410
Van Gogh gave his ear to a prostitute as,

33:57.469 --> 33:59.244
you know, a token of love.

34:00.939 --> 34:05.149
But who knows, what he was,
you know, really thinking.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.976
All right, Marilyn, you've
been through this before.

34:27.032 --> 34:28.670
I'm going to lower the chair.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.203
Is my mother still here?

34:31.268 --> 34:33.215
She's just outside.

34:33.938 --> 34:37.318
This is a local anesthetic.

34:37.842 --> 34:41.585
You've had this before.
Nothing to be worried about.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.297
Put the needle down, Doctor.

34:50.355 --> 34:52.164
What? Get out of here. I'm with a patient!

34:52.223 --> 34:54.203
You're under arrest, Dr. Dysart.

34:54.259 --> 34:55.704
What the hell do you think you're doing?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.103
I'd ask you the same thing,

34:57.162 --> 35:00.234
but the answer would probably
make my hair stand on end.

35:03.301 --> 35:04.609
It's unheard of.

35:04.669 --> 35:07.013
Arresting a doctor in
the middle of a surgery?

35:07.072 --> 35:09.484
Or as we call it, during
the commission of a crime.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.020
Every procedure he performs

35:11.076 --> 35:13.852
is guided by sound medical practice.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.825
Well, maybe he can explain
which sound medical practice

35:16.881 --> 35:18.986
guided him during these procedures.

35:19.884 --> 35:21.886
This laser incision here,

35:21.953 --> 35:23.990
our experts couldn't
figure out what it was for.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.762
- Was it a mistake, a slip...
- I don't make...

35:25.824 --> 35:28.532
My client hardly has to explain
himself to a couple of laymen.

35:28.593 --> 35:31.301
Either two laymen now or 12 later.

35:31.429 --> 35:32.737
(SIGHING)

35:33.164 --> 35:34.802
EAMES: Our experts were also mystified

35:34.866 --> 35:38.439
by the multiple operations
to Miss LeCroix's left eye,

35:38.503 --> 35:40.244
while it seems you hardly touched her right.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.909
Did Medicaid only cover the left?

35:41.973 --> 35:45.546
There is no medical explanation, is there?

35:46.778 --> 35:49.418
His practice is exactly what it looks like,

35:49.948 --> 35:53.020
a state-funded eyeball chop shop.

35:53.718 --> 35:56.062
He's not going to respond.

35:56.121 --> 35:58.499
If you're just going to engage
in character assassination...

35:58.556 --> 36:00.035
There's no character there.

36:00.091 --> 36:03.004
There's just this greedy,

36:03.061 --> 36:06.042
grasping charnel house butcher

36:06.798 --> 36:08.175
who's targeted schizophrenics

36:08.233 --> 36:10.907
because nobody would believe
them if they complained.

36:10.969 --> 36:13.381
Nobody would believe that a doctor would

36:13.738 --> 36:16.651
deliberately mutilate
their eyes to make a buck.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.244
That is not true.

36:18.309 --> 36:21.347
I am not a butcher. I was treating them.

36:21.413 --> 36:24.724
This cut was made to relax the upper zonules.

36:24.783 --> 36:25.887
- Tom...
- And this.

36:25.984 --> 36:28.294
Her presbyopia required me to scrape the lens

36:28.353 --> 36:29.855
before a cortical cataract formed.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.423
You're losing me.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.300
You have to show us.

36:36.661 --> 36:39.107
Show us how you helped these people.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.505
(SIGHING)
The eye...

36:41.566 --> 36:45.139
80% of our sensory intake
comes through the eye.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.877
The brain interprets what the eye captures.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.283
But these people, Doctor,
these schizophrenics...

36:50.341 --> 36:53.083
Schizophrenia, specifically
the visual hallucinations,

36:53.144 --> 36:56.682
occur when the sensory intake,
the information is corrupted.

36:56.748 --> 36:58.193
Corrupted.

36:59.284 --> 37:00.422
You mean, by the eye?

37:00.485 --> 37:02.294
No. By the lens, here.

37:02.654 --> 37:06.796
Corrupt information hits the
posterior subcapsular cataract

37:06.891 --> 37:09.462
- back here, which blocks...
- The optic nerve.

37:09.861 --> 37:12.398
Yes, which leads to the brain.

37:12.464 --> 37:15.343
What I do is remove the
tainted part of the lens

37:15.400 --> 37:18.381
by performing an extracapular
cataract extraction

37:18.436 --> 37:19.642
to clean the lens.

37:19.704 --> 37:23.584
So, a clean lens

37:23.641 --> 37:26.087
let’s more light into the optic nerve?

37:26.144 --> 37:30.820
Yes. More light stimulates the retina

37:30.882 --> 37:32.862
which clears up the hallucinations.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.295
You've actually succeeded?

37:40.325 --> 37:41.463
Not yet.

37:41.526 --> 37:42.971
I was in the final phase of treatment

37:43.027 --> 37:44.904
on Marilyn Reese when you interrupted me.

37:44.963 --> 37:47.204
All right, so, you get rid
of the hallucinations

37:47.265 --> 37:48.801
and you get rid of the schizophrenia.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.711
Is that the idea?

37:51.770 --> 37:55.149
Yes. The patient is free of the disease.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.311
Only sick people take pills.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.946
If I stop taking my pills,
I won't be sick anymore.

38:01.846 --> 38:04.918
Well, this is...

38:05.784 --> 38:07.764
Well, it's...

38:08.720 --> 38:10.028
Revolutionary.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.861
When did you discover this treatment?

38:12.924 --> 38:14.597
My last year at Columbia.

38:14.659 --> 38:16.468
Right after your sabbatical.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.369
Which is when you switched specialties.

38:23.434 --> 38:25.778
Yes. How did you know...

38:26.604 --> 38:29.016
Well, I have an interest in your career.

38:29.073 --> 38:31.747
Why did you take the sabbatical?

38:34.312 --> 38:35.882
I was exhausted.

38:35.947 --> 38:39.190
I needed to clear my head,
reorder my priorities.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.758
So you went to Amsterdam.

38:45.023 --> 38:48.402
(STAMMERING)
Is that where you developed an interest

38:49.093 --> 38:50.595
in Van Gogh?

38:52.163 --> 38:54.200
I'd always been attracted to his work.

38:55.266 --> 38:57.337
But it was in Amsterdam where his work,

38:57.402 --> 39:00.849
well, acquired a special meaning for you.

39:03.741 --> 39:05.379
I mean, as it does many people

39:05.443 --> 39:07.719
whose lives are touched with schizophrenia,

39:07.779 --> 39:09.850
which means split mind,

39:09.914 --> 39:12.019
which is really misleading
because the mind isn't split,

39:12.083 --> 39:14.996
it's just out of its owner's control...

39:15.053 --> 39:16.430
That isn't accurate either.

39:16.487 --> 39:19.764
It's simply responding to corrupted stimuli.

39:19.924 --> 39:22.996
Real physical abnormalities
in the sensory organs.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.404
Yes.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.376
You talking about this?

39:33.471 --> 39:35.815
Most people think he cut it off for love.

39:35.874 --> 39:39.583
But some people say he cut it off

39:39.644 --> 39:41.590
to stop the auditory hallucinations

39:41.646 --> 39:43.284
from driving him crazy.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.130
Isn't that where you got the idea?

40:01.165 --> 40:03.805
That the disease isn't in the brain,

40:03.868 --> 40:07.008
it's in the eyes, the ears, the fingertips.

40:09.374 --> 40:13.584
But the brain is... your brain is healthy.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.051
It's inconceivable that this instrument

40:18.116 --> 40:20.323
that took you to the top
of your class at Columbia

40:20.385 --> 40:22.092
could ever betray you.

40:28.526 --> 40:30.062
It's intolerable.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.606
How old were you, Doctor?

40:38.670 --> 40:39.910
27?

40:40.872 --> 40:42.010
My mother was 32...

40:42.073 --> 40:43.245
There's nothing wrong with me.

40:43.308 --> 40:47.017
No. Nothing wrong. Yes, you have schizophrenia.

40:49.681 --> 40:53.959
That's... That's of no consequence.

40:56.888 --> 40:58.561
My methods are sound.

41:04.662 --> 41:06.005
You had a crisis.

41:08.232 --> 41:12.271
10 years ago, you ran away to Europe.

41:12.603 --> 41:14.139
You kept it a secret

41:14.973 --> 41:19.615
while you applied your wounded
intellect to the problem.

41:19.978 --> 41:24.017
And this is what you came up with. And this.

41:24.082 --> 41:26.528
No! No! No!

41:26.584 --> 41:28.359
I am fully in control of myself.

41:28.419 --> 41:30.421
What you're afraid of, right,

41:30.488 --> 41:32.832
people are going to find out,
pump you full of drugs,

41:32.890 --> 41:34.870
- institutionalize you.
- There'd be no need.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.964
You must have been terrified when
Roland showed up at your office.

41:38.029 --> 41:40.031
Terrified that this psychiatrist

41:40.098 --> 41:42.305
would see through your professional demeanor.

41:42.367 --> 41:43.573
He was there under false pretenses.

41:43.634 --> 41:45.705
He was conspiring to put you out of business.

41:45.770 --> 41:46.840
They don't understand.

41:46.904 --> 41:50.442
Your cure can make people with your
condition masters of their own fate.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.011
- Yes.
- No more drugs, no more stigma.

41:53.077 --> 41:55.182
- Yes.
- No more fear and shame.

41:55.246 --> 41:59.217
No, you had to save yourself.
You had to stop Roland.

41:59.283 --> 42:01.126
- Yes.
- You had to kill him.

42:05.323 --> 42:06.427
Yes.

42:10.795 --> 42:14.072
Oh, no. Now, I have to get back to my work.

42:14.866 --> 42:19.246
Yeah. I need to get back to my work.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.549
Please let me get back to my work.

42:37.188 --> 42:40.829
We agreed to a plea of not guilty
by reason of mental disease.

42:40.892 --> 42:43.338
Dr. Dysart agreed to be institutionalized

42:43.394 --> 42:47.501
until our experts decide he's
no longer a danger to society.

42:47.565 --> 42:48.635
He must be insane.

42:48.699 --> 42:50.804
He's the only one who
wasn't in it for the money.

42:54.539 --> 42:55.813
Where's Detective Goren?

42:55.873 --> 42:57.147
On the phone.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.154
Don't ask.
