01:24.543 --> 01:25.812
Hello.

01:25.845 --> 01:27.446
<i>Hi, Kate. I have
Amy Kim and Jay Lowry for you.</i>

01:28.480 --> 01:30.248
- <i>It's adorable.</i>
- Hi, guys.

01:30.282 --> 01:31.751
- <i>Kate.</i>
- <i>Hi, Kate!</i>

01:31.784 --> 01:32.852
Hi!

01:32.885 --> 01:35.287
<i>How are you feeling
about the release?</i>

01:35.320 --> 01:36.455
I, uh, great.

01:36.488 --> 01:38.423
<i>Everyone here loves the book.</i>

01:38.457 --> 01:40.358
<i>I sent it to my mom.
Did I tell you that?</i>

01:40.392 --> 01:42.327
- Oh!
- <i>She loved it.</i>

01:42.360 --> 01:45.330
<i>And we're all so excited
about the New York Times review.</i>

01:45.363 --> 01:46.598
Great.

01:46.632 --> 01:50.036
<i>But, listen, we got
the first numbers in today.</i>

01:50.069 --> 01:53.438
<i>Unfortunately, Kate,
they are a little lower than expected.</i>

01:53.472 --> 01:54.807
Wait, how low?

01:54.841 --> 01:56.776
<i>I still think they're very
respectable, don't you, Amy?</i>

01:56.809 --> 01:59.578
<i>Yes, especially
for a first-time writer.</i>

01:59.611 --> 02:01.114
- Uh-huh.
- <i>But we're actually calling you</i>

02:01.147 --> 02:05.383
<i>because we talked to Foxtrot this
morning and we have some bad news.</i>

02:05.417 --> 02:07.787
<i>And we are 100 percent in
disagreement with this, Kate...</i>

02:07.820 --> 02:09.756
<i>But they want to cancel
the book tour.</i>

02:09.788 --> 02:11.323
Wait, what?

02:11.356 --> 02:12.925
<i>Honestly, Jay, I just feel
like this is a symptom of the time.</i>

02:12.959 --> 02:16.028
<i>I totally agree. This never
would have happened 10 years ago.</i>

02:16.062 --> 02:21.566
No. Wait, isn't the book tour supposed to promote
the book so that you can get more orders?

02:21.600 --> 02:25.337
- <i>This is so frustrating.</i>
- <i>It's the market.</i>

02:25.370 --> 02:26.639
<i>It's just a very difficult
climate these days.</i>

02:26.672 --> 02:28.641
<i>No one wants to spend the money
to promote.</i>

02:28.674 --> 02:30.810
<i>I feel like we can point
the finger at e-books here.</i>

02:30.843 --> 02:33.411
<i>E-books, yes.
Always with the e-books.</i>

02:33.445 --> 02:34.513
- Yeah.
- <i>But, listen,</i>

02:34.546 --> 02:37.382
<i>Amy and I think we can reopen
this conversation</i>

02:37.415 --> 02:38.851
<i>if we get a good review
in the Times.</i>

02:38.885 --> 02:41.754
<i>Yes, a good New York Times
review could change everything.</i>

02:41.788 --> 02:43.388
<i>We've both seen it happen, Kate.</i>

02:43.823 --> 02:46.391
- Yeah.
- <i>The most important thing is that</i>

02:46.424 --> 02:49.561
<i>you wrote an amazing book, okay?
Now, hang in there.</i>

02:49.594 --> 02:50.663
<i>We'll talk soon.</i>

02:50.696 --> 02:51.798
Okay. Bye.

02:51.831 --> 02:53.465
- <i>Bye.</i>
- <i>Bye!</i>

03:20.927 --> 03:22.094
<i>This is Michael's voicemail.</i>

03:22.128 --> 03:24.496
<i>I won't listen to it,
but I'll see that you called.</i>

03:24.529 --> 03:29.101
Hey, Michael, um, I just wanted to give you a call

03:29.135 --> 03:35.440
because it looks like you're still getting
some pretty important mail, uh, here

03:35.473 --> 03:36.876
and I want to figure out
how to get it to you.

03:36.909 --> 03:41.848
So, um, and it would just
be nice to talk to you.

03:41.881 --> 03:46.719
So, give me a call when you get a chance.
Okay. Bye.

04:26.859 --> 04:29.161
Oh, my gosh!

04:29.195 --> 04:32.832
- So cute. Oh, my gosh!
- Ooh, I love it. Okay, what else?

04:32.865 --> 04:34.499
Janessa, is this you?

04:34.532 --> 04:36.534
All right, girls,
let's take some pictures please.

04:37.502 --> 04:39.537
Oh, my God! Okay.

04:40.640 --> 04:41.674
Is this good?

04:43.809 --> 04:45.645
Ladies.

04:45.678 --> 04:46.913
Wait, Kate get in here.

04:46.946 --> 04:48.714
Oh, yeah. Come on, you have to.

04:48.748 --> 04:50.850
Get... I couldn't...
I'm not pregnant.

04:50.883 --> 04:51.918
Get in here.

04:53.986 --> 04:55.620
To be in this picture.

04:55.655 --> 04:56.822
- I love it.
- Okay.

04:56.856 --> 05:00.592
All right, now turn and show me
your bump, your baby bump.

05:00.626 --> 05:02.828
Oh, God! I can't...
No, I can't be in.

05:02.862 --> 05:04.797
Get in here.

05:04.830 --> 05:05.698
I know.

05:06.933 --> 05:08.000
Look what I got.

05:08.868 --> 05:10.069
- Yes.
- Oh, I don't...

05:10.102 --> 05:13.471
- Open it.
- Is that your new book? I haven't even seen it.

05:13.505 --> 05:14.572
- Look at this.
- Oh, my God!

05:14.606 --> 05:17.209
- Cover is horrible.
- No, it's great.

05:17.243 --> 05:18.678
Look at that.

05:18.711 --> 05:19.845
Okay, ready?

05:19.879 --> 05:20.780
Oh.

05:21.247 --> 05:22.614
Smile.

05:27.987 --> 05:29.554
Perfect.

05:48.540 --> 05:52.878
<i>Hey, Kate. This is a voice from
your past. It's David Kirkpatrick from IU.</i>

05:52.912 --> 05:57.917
<i>It's been a long time since we chatted,
I know, uh, too long. I hope you're well.</i>

05:57.950 --> 06:03.255
<i>I know your book just came out which is wonderful
by the way and I know it's last-minute,</i>

06:03.289 --> 06:06.558
<i>but I'm wondering if you'd be willing
to come down to your alma mater</i>

06:06.591 --> 06:07.592
<i>and do a reading.</i>

06:08.728 --> 06:10.730
<i>I'd love the chance to catch up.
Give me a call back.</i>

06:27.947 --> 06:30.783
Miss Conklin. Miss Conklin.

06:30.816 --> 06:32.818
It's me, Elliot Mobono.

06:32.852 --> 06:34.720
We've been communicating
over a text message.

06:34.754 --> 06:36.989
- I'm the graduate assistant here.
- Yes, hi, Elliot.

06:37.023 --> 06:40.926
Welcome to Carbondale,
or I guess welcome back, right?

06:40.960 --> 06:42.594
Because you went here, right?

06:42.628 --> 06:44.697
- Obviously, that's why you're here.
- Yeah.

06:44.997 --> 06:47.900
I'm here for whatever you need
this weekend,

06:47.933 --> 06:50.669
tour guide, chauffeur,
general companionship,

06:50.703 --> 06:52.838
and I have your itinerary
printed out right here.

06:52.872 --> 06:54.306
Oh, great, great.

06:54.340 --> 06:56.308
I'm a big fan of yours.

06:56.342 --> 06:57.777
I bought your book.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.712
I haven't read it yet,
but I will.

06:59.745 --> 07:01.579
Oh, cool! Thanks for buying it.

07:01.613 --> 07:03.949
I thought it would be awkward
if I didn't.

07:03.983 --> 07:05.985
- Yeah, yeah. I guess.
- Oh, this is me.

07:06.018 --> 07:09.889
I... I'm gonna take you to the
bed-and-breakfast first, if that's okay.

07:09.922 --> 07:11.724
- Sure.
- Great, great.

07:16.128 --> 07:17.730
- Oh, thank you.
- There you go.

07:17.763 --> 07:18.898
Thank you. Oh, I got it.

07:18.931 --> 07:20.666
- I got it. Yeah.
- You sure? Oh!

07:21.167 --> 07:22.334
- You good?
- Yes.

07:53.199 --> 07:54.900
Oh, man.

07:56.168 --> 07:58.704
- That was my old house.
- Yeah?

08:09.982 --> 08:12.051
I kinda remember this place.
Yeah?

08:26.765 --> 08:29.068
Okay, you're here.

08:31.437 --> 08:32.938
Come on.
I'll show you your room.

08:41.113 --> 08:44.015
Wow, this place is perfect!

08:44.049 --> 08:46.018
Fresh towels in the bathroom,

08:46.051 --> 08:50.055
there's an extra blanket in case
you get cold, breakfast at 9:00 a.m.

08:50.089 --> 08:52.992
Oh, wow! I didn't expect
there to actually be breakfast.

08:53.025 --> 08:55.661
I'm not really
a breakfast person.

08:56.128 --> 08:59.031
What did you think
bed-and-breakfast meant?

08:59.064 --> 09:01.934
I thought it's more like
an Airbnb.

09:03.769 --> 09:06.906
Here are your keys.
It's the only set you're gonna get,

09:06.939 --> 09:08.073
so, you better wear them
around your neck.

09:08.107 --> 09:09.208
Got it.

09:16.182 --> 09:18.751
Well, I'll leave you to it.

09:20.553 --> 09:24.890
I'll be back in a little bit to pick you up
for the reading, unless you want me to stay.

09:26.192 --> 09:28.060
Oh, no. I'm fine.

09:28.093 --> 09:30.229
- Of course. Okay.
- Thank you so much, Elliot.

09:30.262 --> 09:32.064
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:43.509 --> 09:45.244
Hey, you're wearing
the same blazer.

09:46.979 --> 09:47.880
Yeah.

09:50.115 --> 09:50.983
Ready?

09:59.992 --> 10:01.093
And here we are.

10:02.828 --> 10:03.762
Oh, wow.

10:06.298 --> 10:10.002
- Kate!
- I'm gonna go sit up closer.

10:10.035 --> 10:11.237
- Hello.
- David!

10:11.270 --> 10:14.273
Wow. Welcome back.

10:15.007 --> 10:16.976
- It's great to see you.
- No, it's good to see you, too.

10:17.009 --> 10:20.179
Thank you for having me. I... I was so
excited to hear you're still teaching.

10:20.212 --> 10:21.880
Yeah, I'm still at it.

10:21.914 --> 10:24.917
Hopefully, I'm better at this whole professor
thing than when you were in my class.

10:24.950 --> 10:27.820
Come on, you blew everyone away
that first year.

10:27.853 --> 10:30.990
You were this young writer who came out
of nowhere, you were so enthusiastic.

10:31.023 --> 10:33.325
Well, I'm older now,
but thanks, Kate.

10:33.359 --> 10:35.160
That's such a...
That's such a big compliment. Thank you.

10:35.194 --> 10:37.830
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Alexis.

10:37.863 --> 10:41.033
Uh, oh, Kate,
this is my wife Alexis.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.135
You have a wife!

10:43.168 --> 10:44.270
I do.

10:44.303 --> 10:46.905
I got one about five years ago.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.141
Well, it is so nice to meet you.

10:49.174 --> 10:51.810
So nice to meet you.
David talks about you all the time.

10:51.844 --> 10:53.012
Oh, really?

10:53.045 --> 10:54.813
No, not all the time.

10:54.847 --> 10:56.081
Not all the time.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.852
- Hello, everyone. We're about to get started.
- I'm gonna go find a seat.

10:59.885 --> 11:01.587
- Please take your seats.
- Nice to meet you.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.022
Nice to meet you.

11:03.055 --> 11:04.189
Not all the time.

11:06.925 --> 11:08.560
My name is April Vavani.

11:08.594 --> 11:13.999
I am this year's student editor of the
Crab Orchard Review, our literary magazine.

11:16.902 --> 11:19.305
- Kate, let's get a drink later, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:19.338 --> 11:20.906
I am so excited to welcome
you all to the last speaker...

11:20.939 --> 11:23.375
Oh, uh...
I love this by the way.

11:24.076 --> 11:25.477
Very cool.

11:25.511 --> 11:27.079
Professor David Kirkpatrick
will be introducing tonight's author.

11:27.112 --> 11:29.615
Please welcome
Professor Kirkpatrick.

11:33.352 --> 11:38.824
Well, and everyone, a big thanks to
April for organizing this evening.

11:39.325 --> 11:40.592
I mean, applause, yeah,
an applaud...

11:41.827 --> 11:44.897
Tonight's author comes to us
all the way from Chicago...

11:44.930 --> 11:48.233
- Oh, thank you.
- ...and has just published her first novel.

11:48.267 --> 11:52.171
She also happens to be one
of my former students,

11:52.204 --> 11:57.009
although I do seem to remember you falling
asleep during one of my lectures, Kate.

12:01.246 --> 12:06.118
And now we have the pleasure of hearing
an excerpt from her novel, Seasons Past.

12:06.151 --> 12:08.287
Please welcome, Kate Conklin.

12:16.028 --> 12:16.929
Thank you.

12:19.098 --> 12:24.970
Wow, thank you, everyone. Ugh.
It is such a pleasure to be back here

12:25.003 --> 12:27.640
and I'm so excited to share
my book with you.

12:27.674 --> 12:28.675
It just came out.

12:30.943 --> 12:32.444
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

12:32.478 --> 12:36.949
Um, yeah, I'm... I am pretty
proud of it, even though, I...

12:36.982 --> 12:42.221
I don't love the cover,
um, but anyway, let's... Okay.

12:42.254 --> 12:45.190
Let's get into it. Okay.
All right.

12:45.224 --> 12:47.226
Um...

12:48.227 --> 12:50.663
But this morning felt different.

12:50.697 --> 12:54.266
The clouds seemed to be moving faster
than he had ever noticed before.

12:54.299 --> 12:56.268
Oh, wait!
Sorry, just for context,

12:56.301 --> 13:01.240
this is when the main character Calvin
meets his love interest Willoughby.

13:03.509 --> 13:05.978
But this morning felt different.

13:06.011 --> 13:10.149
The clouds seemed to be moving faster
than he had ever noticed before,

13:10.182 --> 13:13.018
faster than he thought
maybe he'd ever seen

13:13.051 --> 13:17.690
and the Sun was so bright that as
he walked along the familiar shore,

13:17.724 --> 13:20.993
it felt as though he was
walking under a strobe light,

13:21.026 --> 13:26.098
pulsing almost as often as
the cold waves licked his toes.

13:26.465 --> 13:30.402
And just then,
as he took note of all that,

13:30.436 --> 13:37.209
he started out toward the mossy
rock and found that it was occupied.

13:40.412 --> 13:41.280
Yeah!

13:42.214 --> 13:44.349
- The students adored you.
- Oh, shut up.

13:44.383 --> 13:46.753
I will not shut up
and I will never shut up.

13:46.786 --> 13:49.087
I was surprised they weren't
asking for autographs.

13:49.121 --> 13:52.291
Well, a few of them did ask
for my personal emails.

13:52.324 --> 13:55.461
Oh, wow. Your personal email
address, even better.

13:58.798 --> 14:00.332
Alexis didn't like it.

14:02.034 --> 14:03.435
That's not true.

14:03.469 --> 14:06.438
She's become quite the critic
since marrying me.

14:06.472 --> 14:09.341
Come on, it's fine,
Kate can handle it.

14:09.374 --> 14:11.343
It's good for her.
It's good to hear criticism.

14:11.376 --> 14:15.347
It's just... I had a hard time
connecting, is all I said.

14:15.380 --> 14:16.348
Oh!

14:16.381 --> 14:18.217
It's okay,
it's not for everyone.

14:20.419 --> 14:23.121
I thought it was fantastic.

14:24.490 --> 14:27.493
Well, on that awkward note,
I'm going to use the restroom.

14:27.526 --> 14:30.128
- Come on, it's okay?
- No, it's okay.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.396
I actually just have to go.

14:33.833 --> 14:34.600
Asshole.

14:43.075 --> 14:45.511
Well, that's just a cute
little name she has for me.

14:45.544 --> 14:48.514
- Hmm, for when you're being an asshole?
- For when I'm being an asshole.

14:50.817 --> 14:54.152
Yeah, so what's next for you,
Miss Conklin?

14:55.287 --> 14:56.455
Tell me all of your plans.

14:56.488 --> 15:02.294
Oh, well,
I'm in sort of limbo right now.

15:02.327 --> 15:04.429
- I'm writing some.
- Good.

15:05.264 --> 15:06.231
How's your book doing?

15:06.265 --> 15:11.470
Um, well, not as good
as I would have hoped.

15:11.503 --> 15:14.039
I guess the sales
are sort of low.

15:15.374 --> 15:16.643
I cancelled my book tour.

15:17.376 --> 15:21.079
Well, I'm glad
we got you down here then.

15:21.113 --> 15:23.081
Yeah, me, too.

15:23.448 --> 15:24.349
Hmm.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.252
Listen, Kate.
I wanted to ask you something.

15:28.120 --> 15:32.491
Um, what would you think
about teaching here?

15:33.660 --> 15:37.129
- Teaching here?
- Teaching here.

15:37.162 --> 15:38.230
- Teaching here.
- Mm-Hm.

15:39.531 --> 15:42.467
We just formed a search committee
to hire someone for the fall

15:42.501 --> 15:44.503
and I immediately
thought of you.

15:45.337 --> 15:48.307
Uh, what?
I don't even have an MFA.

15:48.340 --> 15:51.410
That's something I think the committee
could look past for a published alum.

15:57.249 --> 15:59.318
It would be nice
to have you here again, Kate.

16:06.224 --> 16:08.427
- Have a good night.
- Bye! Thanks again.

16:23.241 --> 16:24.142
Oh, God!

16:25.912 --> 16:27.379
Oh, shit!

16:31.550 --> 16:33.218
Oh!

16:56.709 --> 16:58.310
Oh, my God!

16:59.812 --> 17:06.318
I am so sorry. I did not mean to wake
you up. I... I can't find my keys.

17:06.351 --> 17:08.520
I did have it around my neck,
but I'm gonna be honest.

17:08.553 --> 17:11.356
It was a little embarrassing,
so I put it in my bag and I now...

17:11.390 --> 17:15.662
I... I will... I...
I will pay for more keys. I am so sorry.

17:19.699 --> 17:20.633
Okay.

17:25.972 --> 17:26.705
Hmm.

17:30.375 --> 17:31.110
What up?

17:31.144 --> 17:33.746
<i>Laura, guess where I am?</i>

17:33.780 --> 17:36.716
- Where?
- In Carbondale.

17:36.749 --> 17:38.450
<i>On your book tour?</i>

17:38.483 --> 17:40.419
Uh, not exactly.

17:40.452 --> 17:42.955
David Kirkpatrick
brought me down to do a reading.

17:42.989 --> 17:46.693
Whoa, I haven't heard
about that dude in a while.

17:46.726 --> 17:48.161
Oh, remember how he used
to be so into you.

17:48.193 --> 17:53.966
He was not. He's married now.
Also, the point is, I'm in Carbondale.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.302
Wow, Carbondale. That's wild.

17:57.335 --> 18:00.439
And I'm staying at that
bed-and-breakfast on our old street.

18:00.472 --> 18:03.009
Does it still smell like weed?

18:03.042 --> 18:04.010
<i>Yes.</i>

18:05.745 --> 18:10.248
Oh, my God, I love it here.
I forgot how cozy this place is.

18:10.615 --> 18:11.550
Oh, my God!

18:12.451 --> 18:14.654
I am standing right in front
of our old house.

18:14.687 --> 18:16.689
Man, I loved that house.

18:16.723 --> 18:20.592
<i>We had all those like little
Tibetan prayer flags everywhere.</i>

18:20.626 --> 18:24.731
<i>Actually, I'm realizing now that that was
probably some fucked up cultural appropriation...</i>

18:24.764 --> 18:26.733
Okay, I love you. I gotta go.
Okay, goodbye.

18:27.499 --> 18:28.533
<i>Okay,
send me a pic of the house.</i>

18:28.567 --> 18:30.268
Okay, I will. Bye, bye.

18:33.405 --> 18:34.573
<i>This is Michael's voicemail.</i>

18:34.606 --> 18:36.676
<i>I won't listen to it,
but I'll see that you called.</i>

18:37.677 --> 18:40.012
Hey, Michael. It's Kate.

18:40.046 --> 18:41.781
Uh,
I just missed a call from you.

18:41.814 --> 18:46.418
Um, I don't know if you're calling
to get together or whatever,

18:46.451 --> 18:50.355
but I'm actually out of town,
uh, on my book tour.

18:50.857 --> 18:53.793
So, maybe we could get a drink
when I'm back in town.

18:53.826 --> 18:57.496
Great, okay. So, give me a call back.
Okay, bye.

19:10.743 --> 19:13.478
- Hey!
- Oh, hi.

19:13.512 --> 19:16.581
S... Um, sorry.
I used to live here.

19:17.116 --> 19:19.685
Aren't you the visiting author?

19:19.719 --> 19:24.523
Yeah, I'm... I'm Kate. Hi. Hi.
I'm staying right across the street.

19:24.556 --> 19:26.726
Cool, cool. Yeah. I'm Animal.

19:29.629 --> 19:31.097
Did you want to see
the whole place?

19:31.130 --> 19:33.633
Yes, yeah.

19:36.102 --> 19:37.302
That's Hugo.

19:39.404 --> 19:40.740
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:40.773 --> 19:42.340
Kate used to live here.

19:42.842 --> 19:46.444
- Really?
- Like 15 years ago.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.547
Now she's like
a super successful author.

19:49.414 --> 19:51.884
- Cool.
- Well, I wouldn't say super.

19:51.918 --> 19:53.418
You wrote a book.

19:53.451 --> 19:54.687
She wrote a book.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.556
Hey, did they used to call this
the Writer's Retreat back then?

19:57.589 --> 19:59.424
Do you guys still call it
the Writer's Retreat?

19:59.792 --> 20:02.762
- I named it the Writer's Retreat.
- Seriously?

20:02.795 --> 20:05.798
Yes, we were all creative
writing majors.

20:05.832 --> 20:08.868
Man, you're like
our forefathers then.

20:11.469 --> 20:12.638
That's Tall Brandon.

20:13.639 --> 20:14.740
Hey.

20:16.676 --> 20:18.376
Can I see my old room?

20:19.444 --> 20:24.116
- I put those stars up there.
- Wow, I look at those.

20:24.150 --> 20:26.652
Hmm, I used to look
at them, too.

20:32.191 --> 20:35.560
Man, I feel so far away from the
person I was when I lived in this room.

20:35.594 --> 20:38.363
I can't wait to feel far away
from this room.

20:38.764 --> 20:40.498
I remember that feeling too.

20:41.634 --> 20:42.735
And now you're back.

20:42.768 --> 20:44.904
Yes. I'm back at college.

20:46.438 --> 20:47.940
Do you know
Professor Kirkpatrick?

20:47.974 --> 20:49.608
He's the one
who invited me here.

20:49.642 --> 20:53.578
- I don't have him, but my girlfriend's in his class.
- Oh, yeah. He's incredible.

20:53.612 --> 20:55.681
I mean, he's pretty much
the reason I'm a writer.

20:56.649 --> 20:58.651
Yeah, no, everyone seems
to really like him.

20:59.785 --> 21:00.720
Hey.

21:04.589 --> 21:06.826
Do you still want
to get the kegs?

21:06.859 --> 21:09.862
Tall Brandon, you want to maybe
put some clothes on?

21:11.831 --> 21:13.531
I'm not fully dry yet.

21:16.534 --> 21:18.738
We're having a party tonight.

21:18.771 --> 21:20.873
We used to have
incredible parties here.

21:21.908 --> 21:23.175
You should come.

21:23.209 --> 21:24.644
Yeah, maybe.

21:49.702 --> 21:51.938
Chris lunged at me
with unimaginable speed

21:51.971 --> 21:55.675
and plunged his sword past my third arm toward...

21:56.676 --> 21:58.576
Carry on.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.578
...directly into my heart.

22:00.947 --> 22:04.549
Strangely, as I began bleeding to
death in the middle of the park,

22:04.582 --> 22:06.953
all I could think about
was whether this was the fastest

22:06.986 --> 22:09.454
that anyone had ever died
in sword combat.

22:09.989 --> 22:11.424
I was torn about it.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.626
On the one hand, it didn't seem like
anyone could have ever died faster,

22:13.659 --> 22:15.895
but then again, whenever
you think something like that,

22:15.928 --> 22:18.631
there's always someone ready
to defy your expectation.

22:18.998 --> 22:22.702
Oh, wow, well, much improved,
much improved.

22:24.270 --> 22:26.839
I think I may only add one small,
small note. I think you know what it is.

22:26.872 --> 22:28.040
I want you to chop off
the beginning.

22:28.774 --> 22:30.743
First page, gone.

22:30.776 --> 22:31.844
Okay, yeah.

22:31.877 --> 22:34.280
I know it's difficult,
but we should just be in it.

22:34.313 --> 22:35.715
Yeah, thank you.

22:35.748 --> 22:36.782
Be in it already.

22:37.984 --> 22:40.485
All right, so you may have
noticed that we have a visitor.

22:41.687 --> 22:44.657
Uh, some of you were in her
reading last night

22:44.690 --> 22:47.693
and for those of you who were
not, this is Kate Conklin.

22:47.727 --> 22:51.563
Uh, it may interest you to know
that long ago in ancient history,

22:51.596 --> 22:55.067
Kate was in my very first class
ever as a professor.

22:55.801 --> 22:59.705
And I think, that year, I was younger
than you are now if you can believe it?

22:59.739 --> 23:00.873
I can't.

23:00.906 --> 23:02.742
I know.
It does seem unbelievable.

23:02.775 --> 23:05.277
All right, well,
Miss Conklin is here to observe,

23:05.311 --> 23:06.712
so, let's give her something
to observe.

23:06.746 --> 23:07.646
Who's up next?

23:08.114 --> 23:09.015
I'll go.

23:09.048 --> 23:10.582
April. Fantastic.

23:20.893 --> 23:22.028
This is called Duvet.

23:25.064 --> 23:29.802
I imagine you stepping into this dream
wearing your own body and saying,

23:29.835 --> 23:33.139
"What the fuck?" Like you
already know what the fuck?

23:35.074 --> 23:39.011
I don't mean to sound crass, but where your
teeth meet my flesh is a pressure point.

23:40.079 --> 23:43.082
I go limp
when out buying groceries,

23:44.650 --> 23:46.919
the burning orange chicken
in your beard

23:46.952 --> 23:49.889
smells like a pesticide
and it kills me.

23:51.724 --> 23:54.827
Tired now, I unbutton your skin
and slip inside

23:55.161 --> 23:59.799
where everything is white
and only I exist.

24:06.005 --> 24:08.741
I lost a bunch of library books and I
didn't know if that would affect my grade.

24:09.742 --> 24:14.680
That's... That's something you'll have to
talk about with the librarian, you know.

24:14.713 --> 24:15.915
- Okay.
- Yeah.

24:15.948 --> 24:19.018
Kate, thanks for coming.
Did you enjoy it?

24:19.051 --> 24:21.353
Oh, oh, my gosh.
Yeah, I loved it.

24:21.387 --> 24:28.360
All right. Okay, well, it's actually my office
hour now, so I can't hang out, but, um...

24:28.394 --> 24:30.663
Oh, yeah, of course.

24:30.696 --> 24:33.966
But I... I was thinking, uh,
perhaps we could get dinner tomorrow, yeah?

24:33.999 --> 24:34.800
Yes.

24:34.834 --> 24:37.602
- Okay, right.
- Yeah, with Alexis?

24:38.003 --> 24:42.408
Oh, uh, no.
She... She'll be out of town.

24:42.441 --> 24:43.375
Oh.

24:43.409 --> 24:44.677
- In Kentucky.
- Bummer!

24:44.710 --> 24:46.112
Visiting her sister.

24:46.145 --> 24:46.979
Cool.

24:47.012 --> 24:49.148
- Yeah, but you and me, yeah?
- Yeah.

24:49.882 --> 24:51.616
Thank you again for having me.

24:51.984 --> 24:53.618
Thank you for being had.

24:55.754 --> 24:58.858
- Sorry, inappropriate probably.
- Yeah, it's all right.

25:00.126 --> 25:01.727
- I'm not allowed to say this kind of thing anymore.
- No.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.729
But all right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

25:03.762 --> 25:05.064
- Yes.
- Yeah, okay great.

25:05.764 --> 25:06.699
Okay.

25:30.456 --> 25:31.223
Kate Conklin?

25:32.958 --> 25:35.661
- It's me. It's Brad.
- Brad?

25:36.128 --> 25:38.731
Oh, my God! Bradley Cooper.

25:38.764 --> 25:42.902
- Hi.
- Oh, you're like a man now.

25:42.935 --> 25:46.138
Thanks. Thank...
You too. I mean, a woman, I mean.

25:46.172 --> 25:51.177
Wow. Bradley Cooper, crazy!
It's been so long.

25:51.210 --> 25:53.946
Yeah, I... I... I actually
just go by Brad now.

25:53.979 --> 25:55.814
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:57.016 --> 25:58.784
So, what are you doing here?

25:58.817 --> 26:01.787
Oh, right. Oh, I'm just in town
for a few days.

26:01.820 --> 26:04.957
The university brought me down
to do a reading for my new book.

26:04.990 --> 26:08.160
No ways! So, you actually
became a writer? That's so cool.

26:08.194 --> 26:10.095
Yeah, I guess it is.

26:18.170 --> 26:20.906
Oh, my God! What fun thing
are you doing right now?

26:20.940 --> 26:23.943
You're never gonna fucking believe
who I'm getting drinks with.

26:23.976 --> 26:26.078
- Who?
- <i>Bradley Cooper.</i>

26:26.111 --> 26:28.080
<i>From Smith Halls?</i>

26:28.113 --> 26:30.149
Yes, except for he's like
really cool now.

26:31.317 --> 26:34.053
Do you remember
when we saw him crying?

26:34.086 --> 26:36.822
Oh, my God! Yes.
In the Jimmy John's.

26:36.855 --> 26:38.157
You should sneak me
a pic of him.

26:38.190 --> 26:40.125
No, I'm not doing that.

26:40.159 --> 26:41.961
<i>Come on, I want to see him.</i>

26:41.994 --> 26:45.030
No, you always make me do that
and I always get caught.

26:45.064 --> 26:47.933
I want to see him, Kate,
come on.

26:47.967 --> 26:48.867
- No.
- <i>Katie.</i>

26:48.901 --> 26:50.069
No, I'm not doing it.

26:50.102 --> 26:51.036
- <i>Katie.</i>
- I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

26:51.070 --> 26:51.837
I gotta go. I'm here.
I love you. Goodbye.

26:51.870 --> 26:53.739
<i>I gotta go. I love you.</i>

26:58.210 --> 27:01.981
I got a pitcher of beer coming. I hope
that's okay. I took the liberty of choosing.

27:02.014 --> 27:03.249
Oh, yeah. That's fine.

27:04.016 --> 27:06.518
Uh, sorry, this is a work thing.

27:06.552 --> 27:08.554
I have to answer
this real quick. I'm sorry.

27:18.163 --> 27:19.999
Oh, what was that?

27:20.032 --> 27:23.035
Oh, God,
my phone just keeps flashing.

27:23.569 --> 27:24.937
Oh, weird.

27:24.970 --> 27:25.871
Yes.

27:27.339 --> 27:29.174
I'm so glad that you came.

27:30.576 --> 27:35.781
This is weird, but I used
to jerk off to you in college.

27:36.582 --> 27:37.751
Really?

27:37.783 --> 27:41.320
Yes, like you were my number
one... number one jerk off.

27:42.254 --> 27:43.289
Wow.

27:44.290 --> 27:46.892
Yeah, and then
when I saw you today, I just...

27:46.925 --> 27:51.163
It all came rushing back and I was like,
"Oh, my God! I forgot about that girl."

27:51.964 --> 27:53.165
Totally!

27:53.198 --> 27:55.267
Sorry that took forever.

27:55.301 --> 27:57.169
The bartender was so slow.

27:57.202 --> 28:01.173
Oh, that's okay. Uh, do we order
food with you, or up at the bar?

28:01.206 --> 28:03.575
Oh, no. I don't work here.

28:03.609 --> 28:05.611
Oh, yeah. No, Kate,
this is my friend Rachel.

28:05.645 --> 28:08.080
- She's an old friend.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

28:08.113 --> 28:09.848
Oh, that's... It's great.

28:09.882 --> 28:10.416
Yeah.

28:14.019 --> 28:16.388
- So, were you already here?
- Mm-Hm.

28:16.422 --> 28:18.090
Brad invited me.

28:18.957 --> 28:20.159
Yeah, I thought we could all
hang out together.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.828
Totally.

28:25.097 --> 28:26.865
- Kate, you want to vape?
- Oh!

28:27.366 --> 28:29.335
- It's weed.
- No, I'm... I'm good.

28:29.368 --> 28:31.303
- Oh, come on.
- You just press the button.

28:31.337 --> 28:32.271
- Press the button.
- Yeah.

28:33.673 --> 28:35.040
So, what's your book you wrote?

28:35.074 --> 28:36.342
Oh, yeah, tell us about it.

28:36.375 --> 28:37.910
Oh, yeah, oh.

28:37.943 --> 28:40.045
Um, so it takes place
in New England,

28:40.079 --> 28:44.116
on this island off the coast of
Connecticut called Manchester Island

28:44.149 --> 28:47.152
and the main character
is this guy called Calvin.

28:47.186 --> 28:48.987
And he's really wealthy,

28:49.021 --> 28:51.890
but he has this like really strained
relationship with his parents

28:51.924 --> 28:55.961
because he's adopted and he's
always felt out of place, you know.

28:55.994 --> 28:57.963
And, um, so, okay.

28:57.996 --> 29:00.099
So, anyway, every day,
he goes for a walk

29:00.132 --> 29:01.967
and he sits
on this really specific rock

29:02.000 --> 29:04.169
and then one day, he goes there
and there's this woman there.

29:04.203 --> 29:08.974
And he's never seen her before,
but she's beautiful and she's wild.

29:09.007 --> 29:09.942
- And she's...
- Do they fuck?

29:10.677 --> 29:12.044
They actually don't.

29:12.077 --> 29:16.649
He loves her, of course,
but the whole thing is very restrained.

29:16.683 --> 29:19.385
Yeah, I could go
for a little restraint.

29:19.418 --> 29:20.586
Exactly.

29:20.619 --> 29:23.255
So, could I, but you know,
people don't usually want that.

29:23.288 --> 29:26.659
They want something dramatic
and exciting, bold.

29:26.693 --> 29:29.995
But I don't think that life
is bold like it is stories.

29:30.028 --> 29:33.098
I think real life
is just very restrained.

29:48.113 --> 29:50.349
Oh, my God!
I'm not doing this anymore.

29:51.316 --> 29:52.918
Get up, Meredith.

29:53.285 --> 29:55.220
Meredith, get up.

29:55.254 --> 29:58.123
I'm getting seriously pissed off
with you right now.

29:58.725 --> 30:00.259
My legs are broken.

30:00.292 --> 30:02.928
Your legs are not broken.
Get up.

30:06.198 --> 30:09.001
Oh, God!

30:09.034 --> 30:10.068
Fuck!

30:12.304 --> 30:13.972
Oh, my God!

30:49.408 --> 30:51.143
Who the fuck is that?

31:15.067 --> 31:16.268
Write back.

31:18.370 --> 31:20.405
Write back, you fucking asshole.

31:39.826 --> 31:40.559
<i>Hey.</i>

31:43.195 --> 31:46.298
- Hey.
- <i>Laura, I'm at our house.</i>

31:46.331 --> 31:48.400
<i>What are you doing at our house?</i>

31:48.433 --> 31:50.168
They're having a party.

31:50.202 --> 31:51.838
Wait, what happened
to Bradley Cooper?

31:51.871 --> 31:54.339
<i>Oh, that was the worst.
Oh, my God, I'll tell you about it later.</i>

31:54.874 --> 31:57.543
- <i>What's it like?</i>
- It seems cool.

31:57.576 --> 32:00.112
Like way cooler
than our parties.

32:00.145 --> 32:01.513
- Oh!
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

32:03.282 --> 32:08.387
Oh. Well, I guess I was peeing, but now I'm
just sitting on the toilet with my pants down.

32:08.420 --> 32:12.391
Okay, so Michael posted a new
photo and this one is with a girl.

32:12.424 --> 32:14.627
<i>You have to stop looking
at his Instagram.</i>

32:14.661 --> 32:20.198
I know. I only look at it
when I'm sad and I texted him.

32:20.232 --> 32:21.366
Kate!

32:21.400 --> 32:23.135
<i>Oh, shit!
I think he's ringing me back.</i>

32:24.303 --> 32:25.872
It's just my battery.
I gotta go.

32:25.905 --> 32:29.575
Okay, well,
I probably wet my vagina now.

32:29.608 --> 32:30.609
Call me in the morning.

32:31.911 --> 32:32.845
She's gone.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.388
Hey, Tall Brandon.

32:43.422 --> 32:46.391
Oh, hey. You came to our party.

32:46.425 --> 32:48.226
- Mm-Hm.
- This is so crazy.

32:48.628 --> 32:50.362
Do you want some weed?

32:51.563 --> 32:57.235
Um, do you think it's like ethical
for me to do drugs with you?

32:58.403 --> 32:59.504
I don't know.

33:06.244 --> 33:09.481
I used to dance in this room
like 15 years ago.

33:10.515 --> 33:13.185
I was in kindergarten
15 years ago.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.402
- Hey, you came.
- What?

34:03.435 --> 34:04.671
I said, hey you came.

34:04.704 --> 34:05.705
Hold on.

34:08.975 --> 34:11.275
- You came.
- Oh, yeah.

34:11.309 --> 34:12.712
- Yeah.
- Is it weird?

34:13.545 --> 34:15.347
Yes, it's super weird.

34:15.380 --> 34:17.581
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm kidding. It's fine.

34:17.616 --> 34:19.184
No one thinks it's weird.

34:19.686 --> 34:21.353
Trust me, it's awesome.

34:21.754 --> 34:23.621
I mean you're like
an actual writer.

34:25.322 --> 34:27.726
I mean, technically,
you're an actual writer, too.

34:29.561 --> 34:31.429
Technically, yes. That's true.

34:34.399 --> 34:35.467
April!

34:41.406 --> 34:44.342
I'm... I'm going to go dance.

34:44.376 --> 34:46.679
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:57.622 --> 34:58.490
Cool party.

35:00.325 --> 35:01.259
Yeah.

35:12.304 --> 35:13.238
Oh, my God!

35:18.543 --> 35:22.682
Hey, Tall Brandon.
Do you have an iPhone charger?

35:22.715 --> 35:26.351
- What?
- Do you have an iPhone charger?

35:26.384 --> 35:28.020
Oh, I'm a Galaxy boy.

35:28.054 --> 35:29.756
You got to talk to Animal,
he's upstairs.

35:29.789 --> 35:31.023
- Animal?
- Yeah, Animal.

35:31.057 --> 35:32.424
Oh, yeah. Cool.

35:38.097 --> 35:38.831
Animal.

36:10.897 --> 36:11.798
Oh, no!

36:14.466 --> 36:15.600
Did you buy more condoms?

36:16.535 --> 36:17.804
- Good.
- Yep.

36:17.837 --> 36:19.806
Don't rip my skirt.

36:21.107 --> 36:22.474
Don't do it.

36:23.910 --> 36:24.811
You got it.

36:24.844 --> 36:26.813
Mm-Mm, good.

36:28.114 --> 36:33.451
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:33.485 --> 36:36.088
- Help me. Help me with my shirt. Okay.
- Okay.

36:36.122 --> 36:38.724
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

36:39.926 --> 36:41.794
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it.

36:45.798 --> 36:47.099
What?

36:51.938 --> 36:53.673
Wait. Go to the last one.

36:55.507 --> 36:58.845
Hmm, that's definitely
attention-seeking behavior.

36:58.878 --> 37:00.847
Okay,
go to the one with the girl.

37:03.683 --> 37:04.851
I think she's just a friend.

37:04.884 --> 37:06.618
Hold on. See if she's tagged.

37:06.652 --> 37:08.955
Okay. Oh, she's tagged.

37:19.632 --> 37:21.901
My God! He has a girlfriend.

37:22.635 --> 37:24.637
Oh, I'm so pathetic.

37:26.471 --> 37:28.674
Were you hoping you guys
would get back together?

37:28.708 --> 37:31.143
No. Not.

37:31.177 --> 37:34.747
Maybe. Oh, God! Oh, my God!
Maybe I was.

37:35.882 --> 37:37.683
Breakups are hard, man.

37:38.885 --> 37:40.286
Do you want us to walk you home?

37:40.319 --> 37:44.489
No, I can't even get in. I lost the
key and that old lady is so mean.

37:57.535 --> 38:00.873
I can make up a little, um,
bed on the couch if you want.

38:01.606 --> 38:02.507
Oh!

38:06.979 --> 38:08.881
I'll go make it. Right.

38:26.799 --> 38:27.700
What's up?

38:29.802 --> 38:30.937
Oh, my God!

38:33.973 --> 38:35.942
Hey, how are you feeling?

38:36.976 --> 38:37.910
Great.

38:37.944 --> 38:40.578
Is it... Thank you for...

38:40.947 --> 38:43.015
Hey, we should clean up
before we head out.

38:45.751 --> 38:47.552
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

38:47.585 --> 38:49.554
Hey, when are we leaving?

38:49.587 --> 38:51.724
In like, 30.

38:52.590 --> 38:55.728
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:56.594 --> 38:57.595
You're still here.

38:59.065 --> 39:01.834
Yeah, I... I kind of slept here.

39:01.867 --> 39:05.004
Cool. What are you doing today?

39:05.805 --> 39:11.844
Um, I think I'm meeting with
students later this afternoon.

39:11.877 --> 39:13.813
Do you want to hang out before?

39:13.846 --> 39:16.514
Emma got her roommate's car
and we're going to the lake.

39:16.548 --> 39:18.951
Oh, my God! I've not thought
about that lake in forever.

39:18.985 --> 39:20.485
Yeah, it'll be fun.

39:29.328 --> 39:30.730
I think I'm gonna take a shower.

39:43.642 --> 39:44.977
Oh, God!

40:08.934 --> 40:10.903
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:12.905 --> 40:14.073
Nice shirt.

40:15.941 --> 40:16.942
Oh, yeah.

40:19.779 --> 40:21.013
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:34.827 --> 40:35.961
You want one?

40:36.362 --> 40:37.562
Oh, are those drugs?

40:38.596 --> 40:41.667
Yeah, it's a weed gummy,
but it's pretty chill.

40:52.711 --> 40:56.082
Oh, I don't have a swimsuit
or anything.

40:57.416 --> 40:58.717
Just wear your bra.

41:04.657 --> 41:05.357
Um.

41:18.938 --> 41:19.839
Sup?

41:20.940 --> 41:22.208
Sup?

41:23.876 --> 41:25.644
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:26.011 --> 41:26.946
You want to come in?

41:46.165 --> 41:49.201
Oh, man, I don't think
these gummies are working.

41:49.235 --> 41:50.136
Yeah.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.973
Yeah, not really doing anything.

41:54.006 --> 41:55.875
Maybe a dud.

41:55.908 --> 41:58.944
Mm-Hm, yeah.

41:58.978 --> 42:01.847
Hey, I think I read something of
yours from when you were here.

42:02.481 --> 42:03.883
- You did?
- Yeah.

42:03.916 --> 42:05.151
The one about your brother.

42:06.919 --> 42:07.887
You read that?

42:07.920 --> 42:10.156
Yeah, it was really good.

42:13.759 --> 42:15.027
Try saying that to my parents.

42:15.060 --> 42:17.062
They hardly talked to me
after I wrote it.

42:19.765 --> 42:20.966
Did your brother really die?

42:21.500 --> 42:22.234
Yeah.

42:24.236 --> 42:25.938
Was he really an asshole?

42:28.140 --> 42:29.108
Yeah.

42:32.211 --> 42:33.913
I wish I could write
stuff like that.

42:36.115 --> 42:38.684
I don't know,
it didn't really pan out for me.

42:39.218 --> 42:41.153
I think it was too sad
or something,

42:41.187 --> 42:43.189
you know,
made people uncomfortable.

42:45.524 --> 42:49.728
It's not really my style anymore,
you know, it's out of fashion.

42:49.762 --> 42:51.096
Personal essay is dead.

42:53.199 --> 42:54.099
Right.

43:09.114 --> 43:14.520
Yeah, I think, um... I think those
gummies are starting to work.

43:16.288 --> 43:19.825
It's like as soon as you think
you're not stoned

43:19.858 --> 43:21.961
that's when you realize
you're definitely stoned.

43:21.994 --> 43:25.898
Yeah, it's like your body knows
before your mind knows,

43:25.931 --> 43:31.337
but your body is sending signals to your
mind saying, "Hey, check in on yourself."

43:32.538 --> 43:35.274
Yeah, it's like your brain
is too stupid to catch up,

43:35.307 --> 43:37.910
so, you feel it
before you know it.

43:39.812 --> 43:41.247
You feel it before you know it.

43:42.548 --> 43:43.282
Cool.

43:45.117 --> 43:46.118
Very cool.

43:47.553 --> 43:50.522
You're supposed to catch it. Come on.

43:52.024 --> 43:53.259
- You want to play?
- Sure.

43:55.294 --> 43:56.795
All right, all right.

43:58.163 --> 43:59.031
Wow.

44:00.966 --> 44:02.534
Hey, watch out.
Emma has a hell of an arm.

44:02.568 --> 44:03.402
- Oh, shit!
- Ready?

44:03.435 --> 44:05.271
- Yeah.
- We're ready. Yeah, we're ready.

44:05.304 --> 44:08.307
Oh, schnikes!

44:20.586 --> 44:21.920
Hey, what's going on?

44:23.155 --> 44:24.056
April's here.

44:25.157 --> 44:27.926
Oh, yeah. I think I saw her
at the party last night.

44:28.193 --> 44:31.063
Yeah, we haven't seen her
in a while though.

44:32.898 --> 44:34.900
She read a poem
in class yesterday.

44:34.933 --> 44:37.236
Yeah, she's like the star
of the English department.

44:41.206 --> 44:43.075
Animal thinks
she's cheating on him.

44:45.110 --> 44:46.145
Really?

44:48.414 --> 44:50.983
Brandon, get in the water.

44:56.989 --> 44:58.390
Oh, I think I gotta go.

44:59.759 --> 45:04.863
- Elliot, I'm so sorry.
- Not a problem. It was a beautiful drive.

45:22.682 --> 45:23.849
Austin.

45:27.119 --> 45:28.020
Austin.

45:30.155 --> 45:31.890
Hi, excuse me.

45:33.158 --> 45:35.194
I am looking for an Austin.

45:36.328 --> 45:38.163
I... I don't know
about that person.

45:38.197 --> 45:40.999
Oh, damn, I'm supposed
to have a meeting with him.

45:41.033 --> 45:44.370
There was a guy here waiting
around earlier, but he left.

45:44.403 --> 45:46.138
Oh, damn it.
Do you think that was Austin?

45:47.106 --> 45:49.274
- What does he look like?
- I don't know.

46:42.261 --> 46:43.328
Yeah, that's a good one.

46:46.465 --> 46:47.366
Hey.

46:51.336 --> 46:53.505
I really liked your reading
in class, by the way.

46:54.473 --> 46:57.943
- Thanks.
- You're really lucky to have David as a professor.

46:58.477 --> 47:00.212
He was a huge influence on me.

47:00.747 --> 47:03.482
Yeah, he's... He's awesome.

47:07.386 --> 47:09.354
So, do you want to talk
about your work?

47:10.055 --> 47:14.326
Yeah, for sure,
I mean, that's why I'm here.

47:14.359 --> 47:15.527
Okay.

47:15.561 --> 47:17.730
Well, I think if you cut down
on the length of this one

47:17.764 --> 47:19.732
and reformat it,
it would really help.

47:19.766 --> 47:22.067
Plus, I would probably change
the title.

47:23.535 --> 47:25.070
What's wrong with the title?

47:25.103 --> 47:27.105
One-word titles aren't really
in Vogue right now.

47:27.139 --> 47:29.241
They're seen
as kind of grandiose.

47:30.209 --> 47:35.113
Oh, but, uh, I don't think
I want to change it.

47:35.815 --> 47:38.984
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I already really like it.

47:39.786 --> 47:42.221
I wrote it about something
that's really important to me.

47:42.521 --> 47:44.223
I don't want to fuck with that,
you know.

47:44.590 --> 47:45.925
Okay, yeah.

47:45.959 --> 47:49.228
But that's part of being a working
writer, you gotta make a living.

47:50.062 --> 47:53.098
I don't know. I just... I don't
love the idea of making changes

47:53.131 --> 47:55.501
for like some random editor
in New York or whatever.

47:56.368 --> 47:57.336
Okay, sure.

47:58.570 --> 47:59.471
What?

48:00.372 --> 48:02.407
No, I just think
that's a little naive.

48:03.442 --> 48:07.179
You don't get to be difficult starting
out, especially as a woman.

48:07.212 --> 48:09.147
You got to play the game, or
they're never gonna publish you.

48:11.583 --> 48:14.353
Didn't your publisher just
cancel your book tour though?

48:14.386 --> 48:15.521
How do you know that?

48:16.288 --> 48:19.157
- Did David tell you that?
- Yeah.

48:20.092 --> 48:22.327
Okay, obviously, I told that
to him in confidence,

48:22.361 --> 48:24.596
but, yes,
they did just cancel my tour.

48:24.631 --> 48:28.100
But that's more about the state of
the publishing industry than my book.

48:28.500 --> 48:32.037
You can't just keep all your work in a
binder and never try to get it published.

48:32.571 --> 48:34.039
I am not gonna do that.

48:34.506 --> 48:36.074
I'm gonna start my own press.

48:36.108 --> 48:38.544
Start your own press?

48:40.579 --> 48:47.286
Yeah, um, I've been gathering
my friend's work and, uh...

48:56.328 --> 49:00.399
And it'll be properly bound
and everything, obviously,

49:00.432 --> 49:03.335
but, yeah, I wanted to know
what you thought.

49:15.314 --> 49:17.349
Uh, yeah. It's cool.

49:23.555 --> 49:24.623
How'd it go?

49:27.225 --> 49:29.361
Oh, uh, it was fine.

49:29.394 --> 49:34.366
Well, we're off to your next stop,
dinner with Professor Kirkpatrick.

49:34.901 --> 49:35.902
What dinner?

49:35.935 --> 49:38.503
You had me add it
to your itinerary yesterday.

49:39.304 --> 49:41.340
Oh, yeah. Right.

50:11.403 --> 50:13.438
This is why
I never read reviews, Kate.

50:13.472 --> 50:15.675
I will not go near them.
I won't even look at them.

50:17.442 --> 50:21.380
I Google sometimes and read
them... the first line in them.

50:21.413 --> 50:23.382
No, I won't go further in.

50:25.283 --> 50:27.920
Critics are the worst kind
of human.

50:27.954 --> 50:29.354
They are the worst kind
of human.

50:32.557 --> 50:34.326
- Who wrote it?
- I don't know.

50:34.961 --> 50:37.262
Probably Nesbo.
I bet it was Nesbo.

50:37.562 --> 50:39.531
That asshole.

50:39.564 --> 50:42.669
You know there was an email
circulating a few years back,

50:42.702 --> 50:44.536
they had a story
that he wrote in his 20s.

50:44.569 --> 50:46.438
What a piece of shit!

50:46.471 --> 50:48.941
I'll send that to you.
That'll make you feel better.

50:48.975 --> 50:50.743
It'll make you feel
like a genius.

50:50.777 --> 50:52.712
What did your publisher say?

50:53.646 --> 50:55.180
He didn't say anything.

50:55.580 --> 50:56.581
Cowards!

50:57.817 --> 51:00.720
Publishers are just as bad
and you'll find that to be true.

51:02.587 --> 51:06.191
This is exactly the reason I'm
gonna self-publish my next novel.

51:07.660 --> 51:09.762
You and I are so similar, Kate.

51:12.330 --> 51:15.500
That's why it'd be great if you
came and toured next year.

51:16.636 --> 51:17.804
Would it?

51:17.837 --> 51:20.740
Yes, and if you plan it the way
I do, it's not a hard job.

51:21.573 --> 51:24.677
Most of the students don't have a
future in writing, let's be honest,

51:24.711 --> 51:28.380
but the few who do, I mean, you
heard April reading in class.

51:28.413 --> 51:32.350
- You saw how good she was.
- Yes, she's very good.

51:32.384 --> 51:36.789
Well, actually that reminds me,
uh, I should get going.

51:36.823 --> 51:39.659
I promised I'd help her
with her portfolio tonight so.

51:45.631 --> 51:49.468
Hey, chin up.

52:11.523 --> 52:14.660
- Oh, look who it is.
- Sorry, I don't have time for it.

52:17.663 --> 52:20.733
I wasn't sure
you were coming back.

52:20.767 --> 52:22.400
Of course, I was coming back.

52:22.434 --> 52:26.438
All my stuff is here and I had to find another
place to sleep last night by the way.

52:26.471 --> 52:28.507
If it was important for you
to sleep here,

52:28.540 --> 52:30.777
you would have arrived
at a decent hour.

52:30.810 --> 52:34.479
I should be able to arrive whenever I
want because that's how hotels work.

52:34.513 --> 52:37.549
Well, this is not a hotel,
young lady.

52:37.582 --> 52:42.789
This is my home and when you're in my
home, you live under my rules.

52:42.822 --> 52:44.090
Just give me another key.

52:44.123 --> 52:45.457
No more keys.

52:45.490 --> 52:47.392
Oh, my God! Jesus.

52:47.425 --> 52:48.426
Fine.

53:28.466 --> 53:29.367
Hi.

53:30.736 --> 53:31.671
I snuck out.

53:34.606 --> 53:35.507
Oh.

53:38.443 --> 53:41.714
Yeah, she was just like only into herself.
She never cared about him.

53:41.747 --> 53:43.615
Yeah, she sucks.

53:44.183 --> 53:47.586
So, why'd she break up with him?

53:47.619 --> 53:49.621
- She's banging another dude.
- Shh!

53:51.556 --> 53:52.925
She basically admitted to it.

53:57.697 --> 53:59.397
I think I know who it is.

54:00.565 --> 54:01.701
Kirkpatrick?

54:02.668 --> 54:03.568
Yeah.

54:04.569 --> 54:07.606
God, I've always known
that guy was a creep.

54:07.640 --> 54:09.507
He gave me a C in freshman comp.

54:10.176 --> 54:11.811
- Hmm.
- Yeah, I don't trust him.

54:11.844 --> 54:13.179
Also, isn't he married?

54:13.212 --> 54:16.148
- Yes, he is. I just met his wife.
- See!

54:16.182 --> 54:17.950
You should write an article
about him.

54:17.984 --> 54:19.752
Expose his ass.

54:19.785 --> 54:21.453
Yeah, maybe I should.

54:21.486 --> 54:22.889
Oh, come on.
You don't have any proof.

54:25.457 --> 54:28.426
- He's meeting with her tonight. He told me so.
- Really?

54:28.794 --> 54:31.496
- I wonder where.
- I know where he lives.

54:32.965 --> 54:33.900
Should we go over there?

54:37.637 --> 54:39.571
We can just go see if her car
is there or something.

54:40.538 --> 54:42.642
- And then what?
- Then we'll know.

54:43.843 --> 54:45.543
Can you get Chloe's car again?

54:45.577 --> 54:48.613
Oh, shit, no.
She's using it tonight.

54:51.884 --> 54:53.886
I think I know someone
who can drive.

54:58.523 --> 55:00.425
Hey, guys.

55:05.998 --> 55:07.033
Where are we off to?

55:08.668 --> 55:09.567
Right here.

55:10.836 --> 55:13.571
- Great.
- You know the exact address?

55:13.605 --> 55:15.675
It's my mom's house.
He lives behind her.

55:15.708 --> 55:16.742
Oh, crazy.

55:22.982 --> 55:25.583
Brandon, what are you doing?

55:25.617 --> 55:26.953
I'm fucking come prepared, man.

55:26.986 --> 55:28.788
Dude, take off the ski mask.

55:29.587 --> 55:31.057
No way.

55:31.090 --> 55:33.626
Thanks for coming, Elliot. I'm glad
I caught you before you went to bed.

55:33.659 --> 55:37.930
Oh, I was already sleeping.
I took an Ambien, so I was out.

55:38.998 --> 55:43.535
You're on Ambien right now? Are you
sure you're not too tired to drive?

55:43.568 --> 55:47.640
Oh, yeah. No problem.
I'll sleep when I'm dead. Am I right?

55:51.543 --> 55:53.946
All right.

56:05.590 --> 56:06.959
Okay, it's that one.

56:07.860 --> 56:09.762
Right into that... stop there.

56:12.064 --> 56:14.033
Hold on, hold on.
Someone's parking.

56:15.001 --> 56:16.702
Elliot, turn off your lights.

56:21.573 --> 56:22.607
Is that him?

56:24.609 --> 56:27.512
- It's totally him.
- He's got someone with him.

56:28.881 --> 56:30.750
- Should I take a picture?
- No, Brandon, stop.

56:30.783 --> 56:31.884
Oh, my God! Is that April?

56:33.853 --> 56:35.553
I can't tell.

56:36.088 --> 56:37.622
I can't really see her.

56:38.991 --> 56:40.893
You said your mom lives
right behind him, right?

56:41.660 --> 56:43.062
Think we could see anything
from the back?

56:44.030 --> 56:44.930
Probably.

56:45.765 --> 56:47.933
So, drive?

56:47.967 --> 56:48.934
Yes, Elliot. Drive.

56:55.341 --> 56:57.810
Wait, I thought
you were from St. Louis.

56:57.843 --> 56:59.979
I am. My mom moved here
after my parents got divorced.

57:04.383 --> 57:05.117
Why?

57:06.252 --> 57:08.988
I don't know. Maybe she just
wanted to be close to me.

57:11.757 --> 57:13.793
Well, how come
you never see her then?

57:13.826 --> 57:17.163
I don't know, man. I don't always feel
like hanging out with my mom all the time.

57:19.832 --> 57:22.001
- Why?
- Hey, that's... That's it right there.

57:22.835 --> 57:26.072
No, no, no. Not really close to
the street. I don't want her to see us.

57:26.105 --> 57:27.873
Jeez, man. Get a handle
on your relationship.

57:27.907 --> 57:29.842
Shut the fuck up, Brandon.

57:30.776 --> 57:32.144
- Just saying.
- Okay.

57:32.178 --> 57:33.112
This is good.

57:33.846 --> 57:35.580
- Let's go.
- Okay, all right.

57:37.850 --> 57:40.953
Elliot, I think you should
stay here with the car

57:40.986 --> 57:42.855
and I'll call you
if anything goes down.

57:42.888 --> 57:43.889
- Okay?
- Okay.

57:44.757 --> 57:48.661
I might take a small nap.

57:52.398 --> 57:53.132
Okay.

57:54.100 --> 57:56.836
Brandon, would you take off
the ski mask?

57:56.869 --> 57:59.004
No, I like it.

57:59.905 --> 58:03.142
- Would you...
- Come on, that's mine.

58:04.176 --> 58:06.979
Why would you bring this anyway?
We all have cameras on our phones.

58:07.012 --> 58:10.816
Are you kidding me? Do you think anyone
believes anything taken digital anymore?

58:10.850 --> 58:12.785
This offers analog proof.

58:13.185 --> 58:15.788
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God! Why did he do that?

58:16.922 --> 58:18.891
It's... It...
It's motion activated.

58:19.992 --> 58:20.893
Okay.

58:22.461 --> 58:24.396
Tall Brandon,
you're so adorable.

58:24.430 --> 58:25.164
Okay, well, shut up.

58:31.237 --> 58:36.742
- That's a really tall fence.
- It was a lot shorter in my mind.

58:36.775 --> 58:38.677
Come on, boost me over.

58:39.145 --> 58:40.713
Animal, be careful.

58:41.714 --> 58:43.449
Brandon, calm down.

58:43.482 --> 58:45.117
I feel he's going to hurt
his hands.

58:45.151 --> 58:46.152
I got it.

58:49.188 --> 58:50.189
Kate, you ready?

58:54.026 --> 58:56.162
Guys, I don't know.

58:56.195 --> 58:58.030
- I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
- Okay, just drop.

58:58.063 --> 58:59.165
You got this.

58:59.198 --> 59:00.866
Yeah, okay.

59:00.900 --> 59:02.768
Okay, here I come.

59:02.801 --> 59:04.770
I got a real bad feeling
about this.

59:07.806 --> 59:10.042
- Oh, shit! Someone's coming.
- Brandon, come on.

59:10.075 --> 59:11.177
Come on.

59:11.210 --> 59:14.013
I think that was
my first time climbing a fence.

59:15.080 --> 59:16.048
You've got it man.

59:16.081 --> 59:17.950
Good job, Hugo.

59:22.855 --> 59:24.056
Is someone out here?

59:24.089 --> 59:25.858
Fuck, man. It's my mom.

59:27.126 --> 59:30.029
Wait, what about Tall Brandon?

59:30.062 --> 59:31.163
Oh, my God!

59:31.197 --> 59:33.098
There's no one to boost me over.

59:33.766 --> 59:35.100
Hello.

59:35.134 --> 59:38.037
This was very poorly planned.
I feel totally abandoned right now.

59:38.070 --> 59:39.738
Hey, man. We gotta go.

59:42.308 --> 59:45.110
- Hey, you can be our lookout, okay?
- Yeah, let's go.

59:45.144 --> 59:46.045
Okay.

59:47.012 --> 59:48.881
I know you're out here.

59:51.283 --> 59:54.119
You better show yourself
or I am calling the police.

01:00:00.159 --> 01:00:03.195
- Should we talk about a plan?
- Ooh, that's a great idea.

01:00:03.229 --> 01:00:06.799
Okay, I feel like we should figure
out if it's April first, right?

01:00:06.832 --> 01:00:07.600
Yes.

01:00:07.634 --> 01:00:08.601
I really feel like
it's her though.

01:00:08.635 --> 01:00:10.502
- I really feel like it's her, too.
- I know.

01:00:10.536 --> 01:00:11.770
- But we have to be sure.
- Okay.

01:00:13.172 --> 01:00:14.773
Down, down, down.

01:00:19.211 --> 01:00:20.112
Let's go.

01:00:24.183 --> 01:00:26.252
So, you're Hugo's friend?

01:00:26.285 --> 01:00:29.121
I am. Yes.

01:00:29.588 --> 01:00:34.526
Actually, we're more, uh,
roommates than friends, I would say.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.997
And you thought
he would be here.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:39.765
I mean, in... In my house?

01:00:40.833 --> 01:00:42.768
In... my backyard?

01:00:47.006 --> 01:00:49.308
Honestly, I just can't think
of a good lie here.

01:00:54.313 --> 01:00:56.081
You want to see something.

01:00:57.916 --> 01:00:58.884
Yeah.

01:01:02.054 --> 01:01:04.123
A lot of people
just have the stickers.

01:01:05.924 --> 01:01:08.327
If we hear an alarm,
we'll just run away.

01:01:08.994 --> 01:01:09.962
Okay.

01:01:11.063 --> 01:01:11.997
All right?

01:01:28.947 --> 01:01:31.183
This is starting to feel
fucking weird.

01:01:31.984 --> 01:01:33.052
We're in this dude's house.

01:01:33.085 --> 01:01:34.053
It's fine.

01:01:34.654 --> 01:01:36.889
Tall Brandon's our lookout now.

01:01:36.922 --> 01:01:39.258
If anything goes wrong, we'll...
We'll call him.

01:01:46.965 --> 01:01:48.867
This is the craziest shit
I've ever seen.

01:01:48.901 --> 01:01:50.903
Well, wait, wait. Hold on.
Here it comes.

01:01:52.204 --> 01:01:53.939
Watch the guy in the middle.

01:01:56.008 --> 01:01:57.009
Watch that.

01:01:57.042 --> 01:01:59.378
- He's going to do it again.
- I can't stand it.

01:02:06.418 --> 01:02:07.386
I can't.

01:02:08.354 --> 01:02:10.322
Oh, my God!

01:02:10.356 --> 01:02:12.458
Wait, wait. Let me see
another one of these things.

01:02:24.036 --> 01:02:25.938
This floor is fucking squeaky.

01:02:37.483 --> 01:02:40.119
- There's music upstairs.
- We got to go up there.

01:02:40.152 --> 01:02:41.353
We should all go up.

01:02:41.387 --> 01:02:43.122
What are we going
to do up there?

01:02:43.155 --> 01:02:45.124
Tall Brandon's right
about the photo.

01:02:47.292 --> 01:02:48.293
Kate, come on.

01:03:01.974 --> 01:03:03.475
Shh, shh, shh! Wait.

01:03:06.078 --> 01:03:07.079
Wait, just wait.

01:03:15.421 --> 01:03:16.321
Let's go.

01:03:18.323 --> 01:03:19.958
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:29.968
Should we go in there?

01:03:30.002 --> 01:03:31.970
What are we supposed to do
when we go in there?

01:03:32.004 --> 01:03:33.305
I don't know
how to work this thing.

01:03:33.338 --> 01:03:34.406
Oh, you just press the button.

01:03:35.507 --> 01:03:37.409
Just... just press the button,
Animal, right there.

01:03:37.443 --> 01:03:38.410
- Where's the button?
- It's right there.

01:03:38.444 --> 01:03:39.378
It's right there.

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.752
Oh, no, no, no.

01:03:48.755 --> 01:03:50.122
Z

01:03:50.155 --> 01:03:52.324
- What the fuck? Get out of here. Who are you?
- What the hell is this?

01:03:52.357 --> 01:03:54.359
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:57.362
- Who is this?
- It's my boyfriend.

01:03:57.396 --> 01:04:00.132
What? Jesus Christ.

01:04:00.499 --> 01:04:02.267
What the hell, Kate?

01:04:02.568 --> 01:04:04.436
Kate, what are you doing here?

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:06.038
Oh, wow!

01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:12.277
I'm sorry.

01:04:15.047 --> 01:04:16.749
- Stop doing that.
- Come on, man.

01:04:16.783 --> 01:04:18.550
And Hugo.

01:04:19.384 --> 01:04:20.052
Chamomile.

01:04:21.788 --> 01:04:23.222
- It's Emma, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:04:23.255 --> 01:04:24.456
- Peppermint.
- Thank you.

01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:26.358
April, here you go,
another peppermint.

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:32.498
Kate, can I speak with you for a
moment, please, in the other room?

01:04:35.267 --> 01:04:36.168
Excuse me.

01:04:50.415 --> 01:04:51.985
What the hell is going on?

01:04:52.518 --> 01:04:56.088
Can you please explain to me
what you're doing?

01:04:56.121 --> 01:04:58.156
Why don't you tell me
what the hell you're doing?

01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:59.792
I can't believe
I walked in on that.

01:04:59.826 --> 01:05:04.096
Walked in? You broke in.
You broke into my house.

01:05:04.129 --> 01:05:07.533
And as for what I was doing, honestly,
that's none of your business.

01:05:07.566 --> 01:05:11.336
Well, what about your wife? Is it
her business? You are married, David.

01:05:12.104 --> 01:05:15.173
Alexis and I
have an understanding.

01:05:15.207 --> 01:05:18.577
Oh, is that why you waited until she
was in Kentucky visiting her sister

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.813
before inviting a student
into your bed?

01:05:20.847 --> 01:05:23.816
Yes, because she's not
in Kentucky visiting her sister.

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:26.151
She's in Kentucky
fucking her ex-husband.

01:05:26.184 --> 01:05:27.553
Well, that sounds complicated.

01:05:27.586 --> 01:05:28.587
It is.

01:05:33.425 --> 01:05:37.563
Well, I... I guess you care about
policy less than you used to.

01:05:38.363 --> 01:05:39.264
Hmm?

01:05:42.134 --> 01:05:45.571
My senior year.
I came over to your house for a reading

01:05:45.604 --> 01:05:47.306
and I tried to kiss you

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.343
and then you just quoted
the faculty handbook.

01:05:51.376 --> 01:05:52.477
Oh, yeah, right.

01:05:54.479 --> 01:05:58.317
Well, I was a new hire.

01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:00.853
I don't know.
It just... it felt uneven.

01:06:00.887 --> 01:06:02.487
Well, what about April?

01:06:02.521 --> 01:06:06.325
If there's anything uneven in my relationship
with April, it's the other way around.

01:06:06.358 --> 01:06:08.393
- Believe me, she's...
- Oh, fuck off.

01:06:09.629 --> 01:06:13.365
All right, I may have had a...
A minor lapse in professional judgment,

01:06:14.232 --> 01:06:16.636
but I don't want this
to affect you and me, Kate.

01:06:16.669 --> 01:06:20.606
You... Your friendship
means the world to me.

01:06:22.407 --> 01:06:23.710
Did you even read my book?

01:06:24.509 --> 01:06:25.410
Of course.

01:06:26.211 --> 01:06:29.281
David, I saw it on your shelf.

01:06:29.314 --> 01:06:31.316
It looks like no one
even cracked it open.

01:06:32.719 --> 01:06:36.154
I have another copy in my office.
That's just a hard copy.

01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:39.726
That sounds like a lie.

01:06:41.928 --> 01:06:46.899
All right, I don't have time to read every
fucking thing, everybody I know writes, okay?

01:06:46.933 --> 01:06:50.469
I have student work to read
on a constant basis.

01:06:50.502 --> 01:06:54.473
It's never-ending, honestly,
and I'm busy.

01:06:56.608 --> 01:06:59.578
Okay, you're a dick.

01:07:02.581 --> 01:07:05.417
- Come on.
- No, I get it now. You're a dick.

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:15.327
Katie, I'm sorry
I didn't read your book.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:21.934
I will... I will get to it,
but I was there during your reading

01:07:21.968 --> 01:07:23.736
and I thought
it sounded so good.

01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:29.776
The... you know, Willoughby
and the incident on the rock,

01:07:30.977 --> 01:07:33.345
very strong, clear imagery.

01:07:33.378 --> 01:07:34.613
Shut up.

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:41.754
Though I... I would still like to recommend
you for the position here next year.

01:07:42.587 --> 01:07:43.622
I would love to work with you.

01:07:49.594 --> 01:07:53.198
Thanks, but I don't think so.

01:07:55.267 --> 01:07:55.802
Okay.

01:08:09.481 --> 01:08:13.720
Shit, we forgot
about Tall Brandon.

01:08:17.756 --> 01:08:20.693
Oh, my God!
It's looking so good.

01:08:20.727 --> 01:08:22.260
Should we take it out?

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:25.464
- Do you think it's time?
- I do.

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:27.767
Okay.

01:08:31.536 --> 01:08:32.504
Don't fall.

01:08:33.038 --> 01:08:34.238
Don't fall.

01:08:35.041 --> 01:08:35.808
Don't fall.

01:08:41.345 --> 01:08:42.546
Oh...

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:45.685
It happens.

01:08:47.419 --> 01:08:48.787
We can still eat it,
though, right?

01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:52.457
- Of course.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

01:08:52.825 --> 01:08:54.326
He's not answering.

01:08:55.661 --> 01:08:56.662
Maybe he went home.

01:09:00.432 --> 01:09:01.399
He's asleep.

01:09:01.801 --> 01:09:03.602
Elliot.

01:09:06.773 --> 01:09:08.506
Where's he going?

01:09:08.841 --> 01:09:10.042
I don't know.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.648
Sorry.

01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:19.051
Sorry, everyone.

01:09:19.085 --> 01:09:21.687
It's okay, Elliot.
You can just, um, take us home.

01:09:24.657 --> 01:09:26.558
Tall Brandon, did you go home?
Where are you?

01:09:28.661 --> 01:09:29.560
Nowhere.

01:09:30.662 --> 01:09:31.663
<i>Tell me where you are,
Tall Brandon.</i>

01:09:32.698 --> 01:09:35.100
I'm where you left me.

01:09:35.134 --> 01:09:36.702
<i>Get your ass out front.</i>

01:09:42.108 --> 01:09:43.508
I think I have to go.

01:09:44.408 --> 01:09:45.310
It's a shame.

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:46.746
I know.

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:48.446
I had such a fun time.

01:09:48.848 --> 01:09:51.383
Well, you'll just have
to come back.

01:09:51.917 --> 01:09:52.819
Can I?

01:09:53.451 --> 01:09:54.352
Mm-Hm.

01:09:56.588 --> 01:09:57.857
I'm Jen, by the way.

01:09:59.424 --> 01:10:02.728
Brandon, just Brandon.

01:10:21.681 --> 01:10:26.819
Hey!

01:10:36.195 --> 01:10:38.396
I just had the greatest night
of my life.

01:11:04.891 --> 01:11:05.791
Going in?

01:11:06.792 --> 01:11:09.527
Yeah. I think
I'm on the couch again tonight.

01:11:09.962 --> 01:11:12.698
No, no, you can sleep on my bed.
I'll take the couch.

01:11:12.732 --> 01:11:15.167
Oh, no.
No, you don't have to do that.

01:11:15.201 --> 01:11:17.703
Well, technically,
it is your room.

01:11:18.804 --> 01:11:20.840
Technically, that's true.

01:11:20.873 --> 01:11:22.975
All right,
so you're taking your room.

01:11:23.009 --> 01:11:24.810
Wow, thank you.

01:11:32.584 --> 01:11:33.920
- Here you go.
- Oh.

01:11:34.654 --> 01:11:35.553
Thanks.

01:11:42.228 --> 01:11:43.663
She loved those photos.

01:11:43.696 --> 01:11:45.965
I'm sorry.

01:11:56.242 --> 01:11:57.509
What happened with you?

01:11:59.045 --> 01:12:00.478
Your boyfriend?

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:06.786
You mean my fiancÃ©?

01:12:07.585 --> 01:12:08.486
FiancÃ©?

01:12:10.256 --> 01:12:11.991
- Damn.
- Yeah.

01:12:13.826 --> 01:12:14.994
Nothing happened.

01:12:16.561 --> 01:12:20.900
I mean, nothing dramatic. I mean, I just...
No, I didn't want to marry him.

01:12:23.302 --> 01:12:26.471
And I knew it
when he proposed to me.

01:12:26.839 --> 01:12:30.876
And I knew it
when I told my parents

01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:34.847
and when we picked out
the caterer and deejay

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:38.951
and all that stuff.

01:12:38.985 --> 01:12:42.088
And I was just, you know,

01:12:43.055 --> 01:12:46.926
too much of a coward
to do anything about it.

01:12:46.959 --> 01:12:51.897
So, finally he broke up with me.

01:12:54.333 --> 01:13:00.039
And now he's with someone else.

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:04.043
She seems great, so that's nice.

01:13:06.746 --> 01:13:11.951
And my book is doing so bad

01:13:16.322 --> 01:13:21.127
and the one person who told me that he
liked it, didn't even fucking read it.

01:13:26.699 --> 01:13:31.637
You know that story of yours that
I said I read about your brother?

01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:32.905
Let me guess,
you didn't read it?

01:13:33.706 --> 01:13:37.877
I read it
and it was really good.

01:13:41.947 --> 01:13:42.848
Yeah.

01:13:43.382 --> 01:13:44.717
Yeah, it was.

01:13:47.887 --> 01:13:50.756
And it was really fucking sad.

01:13:54.026 --> 01:13:57.730
Yeah, it was.

01:14:17.683 --> 01:14:18.851
Can I play you a song?

01:14:19.718 --> 01:14:20.653
Mm-Hm.

01:15:02.862 --> 01:15:03.996
You know, I've been thinking,

01:15:08.067 --> 01:15:12.204
just because a connection
with a person

01:15:12.238 --> 01:15:16.642
doesn't last forever

01:15:19.778 --> 01:15:21.680
doesn't mean it's not real.

01:15:23.716 --> 01:15:24.950
- You know.
- Mm-Hm.

01:15:27.987 --> 01:15:30.222
Yeah, I think that's true.

01:17:25.204 --> 01:17:26.305
Hi.

01:17:28.874 --> 01:17:29.775
Hi.

01:17:31.243 --> 01:17:32.978
Did you sleep here?

01:17:33.846 --> 01:17:36.949
- Is that Hugo's shirt?
- Um, um...

01:17:36.982 --> 01:17:37.883
Oh, my God!

01:17:38.584 --> 01:17:39.618
I can't believe this.

01:17:39.653 --> 01:17:43.022
- You are such a hypocrite.
- Well... I... I don't...

01:17:43.055 --> 01:17:45.257
You know how embarrassing
that was for me last night?

01:17:45.891 --> 01:17:46.892
It was humiliating.

01:17:47.627 --> 01:17:49.928
And now you're doing
like the same fucking thing.

01:17:49.962 --> 01:17:55.334
Well, it's not exactly the same
thing, but it is a very similar thing.

01:17:56.201 --> 01:17:58.003
God! You know what really sucks?

01:17:58.638 --> 01:18:03.309
I was really looking forward to
meeting you and you weren't even nice.

01:18:03.342 --> 01:18:08.047
And your book, you know what,
your book is just...

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.115
I know my book sucks.

01:18:10.949 --> 01:18:12.384
All right? I know.

01:18:13.319 --> 01:18:15.054
How do you think that feels?

01:18:15.087 --> 01:18:16.422
I didn't want to write
a shitty book.

01:18:17.289 --> 01:18:19.124
- Then why did you?
- I don't know.

01:18:19.158 --> 01:18:22.361
I'm not good enough to write a
good book, I guess, or I was...

01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:24.997
Life is not like school,
all right.

01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:29.968
It's not like a safe place to try
things out and I was afraid to fail.

01:18:30.002 --> 01:18:32.237
And then I did fail.

01:18:32.271 --> 01:18:39.278
And now I feel
pretty fucking stupid.

01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:49.121
But I'm sorry I wasn't more
encouraging when we met because I...

01:18:51.658 --> 01:18:53.392
I think I'm just jealous of you.

01:18:54.126 --> 01:18:54.993
What?

01:18:56.328 --> 01:18:59.932
It's all like possibility for
you and I've already fucked up.

01:19:03.670 --> 01:19:06.171
I know I'm probably the last
person you ever want to see,

01:19:06.205 --> 01:19:08.407
but if there's anything
I can ever do to help you...

01:19:11.043 --> 01:19:11.944
Thanks.

01:19:23.455 --> 01:19:27.226
- Checking out?
- Uh, no.

01:19:27.259 --> 01:19:31.430
I, uh, I was just hoping
for some breakfast.

01:19:34.199 --> 01:19:35.167
Oh!

01:19:38.971 --> 01:19:40.406
This looks amazing.

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.242
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

01:19:47.747 --> 01:19:49.081
Thank you so much.

01:19:56.188 --> 01:19:57.089
Mm.

01:20:09.368 --> 01:20:11.370
Hey, I'm sorry
I missed your calls.

01:20:11.403 --> 01:20:14.173
It's been like a crazy 24 hours.

01:20:14.206 --> 01:20:17.176
<i>Hey, that's okay.</i>

01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:18.343
Are you alright?

01:20:18.377 --> 01:20:24.316
Well, I mean, I don't know.
I guess I'm like in labor.

01:20:24.349 --> 01:20:28.353
What? Already?
Isn't this like really early?

01:20:28.387 --> 01:20:32.257
Yeah, three weeks, um,
but they think it's okay.

01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:37.496
Ugh, they told me not to come in
until my contractions get worse, so...

01:20:37.529 --> 01:20:40.365
- Where's Matt?
- He's still in fucking Belgium.

01:20:40.399 --> 01:20:43.770
Oh, my God, Laura. Okay.
Oh, how about your mom?

01:20:43.803 --> 01:20:47.139
She's coming, but she really
stresses me out, Kate.

01:20:47.172 --> 01:20:49.274
<i>Fuck. I know she does.</i>

01:20:49.308 --> 01:20:52.344
Okay, I can come straight there
if you want me to.

01:20:52.377 --> 01:20:54.781
Yeah, I really want you to.

01:20:54.814 --> 01:20:59.752
Okay, I will see you
in approximately six hours.

01:20:59.786 --> 01:21:01.420
Fuck, that sounds like
a really long time.

01:21:02.154 --> 01:21:03.088
This is what I'm gonna do.

01:21:03.121 --> 01:21:05.491
I'm gonna call you back
in 20 minutes, okay?

01:21:05.524 --> 01:21:07.292
- Okay.
- I love you.

01:21:07.326 --> 01:21:08.360
I love you, too.

01:21:08.393 --> 01:21:11.096
<i>You squeeze
that cervix shut, okay?</i>

01:21:11.129 --> 01:21:12.331
<i>Okay, I'll try.</i>

01:21:12.364 --> 01:21:14.366
Hey, don't let the baby out.
I love you. Bye.

01:21:21.607 --> 01:21:23.008
Good morning.

01:21:23.475 --> 01:21:24.576
Ready to head out?

01:21:32.084 --> 01:21:35.220
By the way, I read your book.

01:21:36.188 --> 01:21:39.091
- You did?
- Yep, it's great.

01:21:39.124 --> 01:21:41.393
I love Willoughby. So feisty.

01:21:41.426 --> 01:21:44.229
Yeah.

01:21:46.331 --> 01:21:48.033
How do you feel about it?

01:21:49.434 --> 01:21:50.435
What do you mean?

01:21:51.537 --> 01:21:55.541
You know, now that it's out.
All the hoopla's over.

01:21:57.175 --> 01:21:58.143
What do you think?

01:22:00.178 --> 01:22:05.183
I think... it could be better.
