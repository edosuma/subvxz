<i>Previously on "The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City"...</i>

00:04.265 --> 00:06.136
This is Vail part two.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.008
So where is Mary and Meredith?

00:08.051 --> 00:10.314
Well, she missed the first trip
because of her dad's memorial.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.360
But do you think
that's true, though?

00:12.403 --> 00:13.491
When you called her,
you were like,

00:13.535 --> 00:15.058
she's in the middle
of her memorial.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.668
She was in the middle
of something. I don't know.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.409
Everyone has a different story.

00:18.453 --> 00:21.412
You all can spew lies
about me all day,

00:21.456 --> 00:24.241
and do not bring my father
into it!

00:24.285 --> 00:26.026
My family is off-limits!

00:26.069 --> 00:29.246
But I don't we said it was fake.
We were like, "Is it true?"

00:29.290 --> 00:31.074
I can't. Mnh-mnh.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.076
Why don't you just wanna
be peaceful and...

00:33.120 --> 00:35.165
I care about what matters.

00:35.209 --> 00:37.385
Your husbands sent me out here
to make sure

00:37.428 --> 00:39.691
that you bitches have fun.
- I think we should drop it.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.650
Just like that.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.434
Now your goal is to come
all the way down.

00:43.478 --> 00:44.392
- Great job.
- There it is.

00:44.435 --> 00:47.525
- Perfect.
- Whoo!

00:47.569 --> 00:49.179
Jennie, I wanna apologize.

00:49.223 --> 00:52.095
I just shut the door
on new people in my life.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.706
I don't mean it personally.
It would be anyone.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.231
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.373
Baby.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.162
Oop.

01:17.207 --> 01:19.557
Okay.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.733
Okay. Okay. I'm done.

01:21.777 --> 01:24.171
You met Jen Shah one for one,

01:24.214 --> 01:27.261
mano a mano for the whole night
partying it up.

01:27.304 --> 01:32.179
I think I was very, um...
level-headed and tame.

01:35.356 --> 01:37.140
To Club Zion!

01:37.184 --> 01:39.403
- Love you, babe.
- Yes!

01:39.447 --> 01:42.667
Clearly, we have been touched
by the hand of God.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.582
There's no other explanation.

01:44.626 --> 01:47.107
Lions lying down with lambs.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.847
There must be angels amongst us.

01:48.891 --> 01:51.415
This is God's promised land.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.156
Watch how this moves
in the wind.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.462
So I'm gonna, like,
try to get going fast

01:54.505 --> 01:56.420
and then just being like...
- Yeah.

01:56.464 --> 01:59.119
You get a... What is it called,
a nice gallop going?

01:59.162 --> 02:00.120
- Or what is it called?
- A canter.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.599
A nice canter going.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.775
This is a gallop,
and this is a canter.

02:03.819 --> 02:07.301
Do it a little bit different.

02:10.826 --> 02:13.655
- Are we ready, Meredith?
- You look so nice.

02:13.698 --> 02:16.614
I thought we were doing spa,
so I didn't put on any makeup.

02:16.658 --> 02:19.269
I just put on a little lipstick
and a little face stuff.

02:19.313 --> 02:22.533
- Yeah.
- But no, I mean, Jennie...

02:22.577 --> 02:25.406
- Oh!
- It's called sunglasses.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.451
- Jen.
- Whitney.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.453
I need to consult you
with my look for today.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.847
Okay. I'm just taking a nap
while I'm getting my makeup--

02:31.890 --> 02:35.590
- Can I borrow some more hair?
- You found my extensions?

02:35.633 --> 02:38.375
I found this one at the pool.
I found this one on the pole.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.640
I want you to know that hell
has not frozen over,

02:42.684 --> 02:44.512
but Lisa asked me to go
on a date,

02:44.555 --> 02:48.211
and I graciously accepted.
- Really?

02:48.255 --> 02:51.171
She's gonna come back in love
with me. Sorry, everyone.

02:51.214 --> 02:53.477
I already am in love with you.

02:53.521 --> 02:56.176
It seems like things are
on a positive trajectory.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.481
Believe it or not,
Heather and Lisa

02:57.525 --> 02:59.918
are going horseback riding
together.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.312
Bye, kids.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.227
Okay.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.838
Whitney and Jen are going
to go ATVing.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.927
- Let me put--
- Listen, just in case

03:08.971 --> 03:11.582
we get stranded,
I turn into the SOS flag

03:11.626 --> 03:13.671
on the side of the road.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.848
And I am going with Mary
and Jennie to the spa.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.286
Good.

03:19.329 --> 03:20.809
Maybe our husbands were right.

03:20.852 --> 03:23.551
Maybe we just needed
a little fun together.

03:23.594 --> 03:27.207
But then again, when are
the husbands ever right?

03:27.250 --> 03:30.210
So maybe I'm wrong on this.
We'll see.

03:30.253 --> 03:34.866
Good morning or afternoon
or whatever time of day it is.

03:43.397 --> 03:46.922
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Here we go.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.880
- Are you Ray and Whitnee?
- Yes.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.708
- I'm Heather.
- So nice to meet you guys.

03:50.752 --> 03:53.407
- Nice to meet you. Hi, Whitnee.
- We're so excited!

03:53.450 --> 03:56.627
I mean, if someone had asked me
two months ago...

03:56.671 --> 03:57.628
Ready up?

03:57.672 --> 03:59.282
...if I would be
horseback riding

03:59.326 --> 04:02.633
alone with Heather,
that would be a definite no.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.592
Oh, I even have a rope.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.376
I didn't get a rope.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.466
My Barbie horse does not have
all the accessories, okay?

04:09.510 --> 04:11.381
There's, like,
a first for everything,

04:11.425 --> 04:12.948
and today this is a first.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.732
We'll start this way.

04:14.776 --> 04:17.387
- Hello.
- How are you guys doing?

04:17.431 --> 04:19.563
- Good. How are you?
- Hi!

04:19.607 --> 04:21.391
Great. You guys ready
to go for a ride today?

04:21.435 --> 04:23.567
- Oh, we are ready for a ride.
- I like your T-shirt.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.265
Oh, thank you.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.831
- "Let's do something dirty."
- Oh.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.877
Speaking Whitney's language.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.531
So what we're gonna do
is we're gonna run you up

04:30.574 --> 04:31.706
on the Grafton Mesa road.
Um...

04:31.749 --> 04:35.536
- How do you open the door?
- Right here.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.277
Oh, great.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.843
There are some overlooks
up there,

04:38.887 --> 04:40.410
and I'll show you around
a little bit.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.759
Squeeze this out
from under you there.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.892
Oh, we have...we're gonna be
like a pilot?

04:43.935 --> 04:45.285
- Yeah.
- Have you guys--

04:45.328 --> 04:47.461
either one of you
ever done it before?

04:47.504 --> 04:49.854
Okay, so if you wanna go ahead
and start the car.

04:49.898 --> 04:51.378
We're ready.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.380
Let's hit the trail.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.447
I chose to go ATV riding because

05:17.491 --> 05:19.754
Whitney can actually drive
an ATV,

05:19.797 --> 05:21.886
but I'm just now realizing

05:21.930 --> 05:23.714
Whitney is more hungover
than I am right now.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.630
I think she was drinking out
of a serving dish last night.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.982
I think I may have chosen wrong
today.

05:44.387 --> 05:47.782
Can I say thank you,
beautiful horse?

05:47.825 --> 05:49.740
Thanks for letting me
ride your horses.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.829
There are some drinks,
some Popsicles

05:51.873 --> 05:52.961
in that cooler over there.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.397
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.833
That's so nice!
Thank you so much.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.400
- Thank you!
- Thank you, thank you.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.010
Heather, what are you
in the mood for?

05:59.054 --> 06:00.795
Well, I'm always in the mood
for a Popsicle.

06:00.838 --> 06:04.581
- Ooh, a creamy to boot.
- Ooh, the good stuff.

06:04.625 --> 06:07.845
Who knew the gem of friendship
lying underneath the surface

06:07.889 --> 06:09.456
with me and Lisa?

06:09.499 --> 06:11.980
And all we needed was a couple
of stallions between our legs,

06:12.023 --> 06:14.939
and we're just two girls
having a great time.

06:14.983 --> 06:18.378
This looks just like a set
of a Britney Spears video.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.945
I was thinking the same thing.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.860
Thank you for asking me out
on this date.

06:22.904 --> 06:25.559
- At first I wanted to say no.
- Our first date.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.735
But then I thought,
you know what?

06:27.778 --> 06:29.519
She's cute. She's got money.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.739
Give her a chance.

06:31.782 --> 06:34.045
Thanks for giving me a chance,
Heather.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.569
Well, it's been a good date.

06:35.612 --> 06:36.744
I'm glad I checked
the right boxes.

06:36.787 --> 06:39.790
Thanks for the creamy.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.097
I just wanna stay
in a great place with you.

06:42.140 --> 06:45.883
Yeah, but, like, you've been
at odds with...everybody

06:45.927 --> 06:48.451
in defense of Meredith.

06:48.495 --> 06:51.149
I just felt for you,
and I just--I feel like...

06:51.193 --> 06:53.848
I feel for me, too.

06:53.891 --> 06:55.502
You know I told you guys this
on the van.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.634
There has been tension
between me and Meredith.

06:59.506 --> 07:02.465
I never considered,
not for even a second,

07:02.509 --> 07:04.467
really the fact that Meredith

07:04.511 --> 07:06.643
hadn't been showing up
for you at all.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.036
- Not at all.
- And it wasn't until

07:08.079 --> 07:11.779
the first night at dinner
here in Zion...

07:11.822 --> 07:13.171
- Mm-hmm.
- ...when you just said,

07:13.215 --> 07:14.912
you know, you could've
used a little more.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.001
I upset Meredith very badly.

07:17.045 --> 07:21.528
She felt like I was not
there for her 100%.

07:21.571 --> 07:22.616
Oh, okay.
You weren't there for her.

07:22.659 --> 07:26.576
Was she there for you 100%,
Lisa?

07:26.620 --> 07:27.925
Was she?

07:27.969 --> 07:30.145
I could've used a little more.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.627
And that was, like,
the first moment

07:33.670 --> 07:35.672
that I just kind of saw it
for the first time

07:35.716 --> 07:40.547
from your perspective at all,
and I felt that for you.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.463
Thanks, Heather. Like, honestly,
that means a lot because

07:43.506 --> 07:44.638
it's hurtful for me because

07:44.681 --> 07:47.902
I feel vested
in Meredith's friendship.

07:47.945 --> 07:50.948
It actually feels nice to have
someone actually see me,

07:50.992 --> 07:52.602
and for actually acknowledging

07:52.646 --> 07:54.778
that I do always have
Meredith's back,

07:54.822 --> 07:56.954
and I do care a lot
about our friendship,

07:56.998 --> 07:58.826
and I'm there to support her

07:58.869 --> 08:00.871
and that it's not always
reciprocated.

08:00.915 --> 08:04.919
And it's actually ironic that
it's Heather pointing it out.

08:10.098 --> 08:13.928
Whoo!

08:13.971 --> 08:16.234
Wow! Wow! That was fun.

08:16.278 --> 08:17.497
Awesome.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.150
Does it look like I ate ass?

08:21.588 --> 08:23.981
Oh, my gosh.
This is beautiful.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.070
Just enjoy yourself. Let me know
when you guys are ready.

08:26.114 --> 08:27.507
Thank you.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.204
I'm just gonna grab our snacks
really quick.

08:29.247 --> 08:30.771
Salt and vinegar chips.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.076
Should we sit right there?

08:32.120 --> 08:34.122
- Yeah, let's enjoy the view.
- Okay.

08:37.038 --> 08:40.041
- Did you enjoy that?
- I did. That was really fun.

08:40.084 --> 08:43.174
Not as fun as last night,
but actually, last night,

08:43.218 --> 08:46.090
I've not laughed that hard
in a very long time.

08:46.134 --> 08:48.745
- My abs are sore.
- We laughed a lot.

08:48.789 --> 08:52.009
You know what I was really
surprised about?

08:52.053 --> 08:57.537
Yesterday morning started,
Meredith was, like, screaming.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.190
Meredith went zero to 500.

08:59.234 --> 09:02.193
My father died, so I couldn't
go in a ----ing Sprinter van?!

09:06.023 --> 09:08.243
But we still didn't get, like,
a solid answer.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.245
She never even said
if it happened.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.029
You know what I mean? Yeah.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.858
Like, if your best friend is
just coming to you

09:14.902 --> 09:17.774
and saying something, wouldn't
you just answer the question?

09:17.818 --> 09:23.954
"No. Of course it happened,"
and then go off, or whatever.

09:26.261 --> 09:28.568
I mean, listen,

09:28.611 --> 09:32.702
if Meredith can lie about
her own father's memorial,

09:32.746 --> 09:34.922
what else is she capable
of lying about?

09:34.965 --> 09:39.579
The sky's the limit to me.
Where are your boundaries?

09:39.622 --> 09:41.232
The truth of it is
is it looks fricking weird.

09:41.276 --> 09:44.018
She tells us she gets
a private investigator,

09:44.061 --> 09:46.107
and the night before we leave,
she doesn't show up on the bus.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.630
I don't know.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.197
Is she trying to cover
something up?

09:49.240 --> 09:51.068
Because clearly,
it's not adding up,

09:51.112 --> 09:54.637
so either she lied
about her dad's memorial,

09:54.681 --> 09:56.944
which, you know,
that's a hard thing to question

09:56.987 --> 09:59.686
because she's grieving
the loss of her father,

09:59.729 --> 10:02.732
but is that all just, like,
a cover-up for something else?

10:04.342 --> 10:06.736
Yesterday morning seemed
so bizarre to me.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.085
I apologized to you guys
because I didn't like

10:08.129 --> 10:10.653
that you guys yelled at.
I'm--I would never--

10:10.697 --> 10:12.263
- We got totally yelled at.
- Um, me, too.

10:12.307 --> 10:13.700
And said that we were
speculating

10:13.743 --> 10:15.049
that it was a fake memorial.
- Me, too, me, too.

10:15.092 --> 10:17.791
I didn't tell her
we were speculating about it.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.662
I never called it
a fake memorial.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.359
- I never said that.
- I should have shut that down

10:21.403 --> 10:22.534
when everyone was saying, like,
"Well, Meredith wasn't here."

10:22.578 --> 10:24.928
'Cause I knew
she was already in Aspen

10:24.972 --> 10:27.365
having the memorial for her dad.
I was fine with that.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.367
And she was just gonna meet us
in Vail on Tuesday.

10:29.411 --> 10:32.632
- She had it on Monday?
- She'd had it on Monday.

10:32.675 --> 10:36.287
Wait, did we leave on Monday?
'Cause I called her--

10:36.331 --> 10:38.333
No, Jen got arrested on Tuesday,
and we--

10:38.376 --> 10:39.813
Oh, okay, yeah, but--

10:39.856 --> 10:41.118
She had the memorial
before Monday.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.686
Yeah, but I called her--
No, it was Tuesday.

10:43.730 --> 10:44.992
I was in the van.
What I remember saying--

10:45.035 --> 10:47.037
"Oh, you guys, she's in
her dad's memorial.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.039
I can't believe I just
called her. I feel terrible."

10:49.083 --> 10:50.693
I feel awful calling you.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.653
Jen's husband, um,
is in the hospital.

10:53.696 --> 10:54.958
Meredith, I hate
interrupting you right now.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.656
Go be with your family
right now. I love you.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.919
I'll see you in a little bit.

10:58.962 --> 11:00.094
<i>I love you. Love you.</i> <i>
All right, goodbye.</i>

11:00.137 --> 11:02.792
All right, I love you.
All right, bye.

11:02.836 --> 11:05.969
- When was the memorial?
- I think it was Tuesday morning.

11:06.013 --> 11:07.971
Well, then she's lying to you,
or she's lying to me.

11:11.061 --> 11:12.323
<i>Coming up...</i>

11:12.367 --> 11:15.022
How about you, Mary?
Did you talk to Robert?

11:15.065 --> 11:18.155
That side of my life, I'm not
comfortable talking about,

11:18.199 --> 11:21.158
especially because I don't
really know you like that.

11:28.557 --> 11:29.732
When was the memorial?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.691
I think it was Tuesday morning.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.693
Well, then she's lying to you,
or she's lying to me.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.433
Or she's lying to both of us,

11:35.477 --> 11:37.305
and there was no memorial
at all.

11:39.829 --> 11:43.877
I really hope that Meredith
is not that ----ed up

11:43.920 --> 11:46.227
to do something like this.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.316
Is there something bigger
than happened with you two?

11:48.359 --> 11:51.319
No. Nothing.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.452
Unless she's not saying
something.

11:54.496 --> 11:57.717
Going back to last year
when we learned the information

11:57.760 --> 11:59.762
about her being separated
and having boyfriends...

11:59.806 --> 12:00.850
Mm-hmm.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.331
Was there more to that?

12:03.374 --> 12:04.898
- 'Cause that? I...
- No.

12:04.941 --> 12:10.773
It is so clear that Meredith
has a vendetta against Jen,

12:10.817 --> 12:14.603
but it has to be more
than Twitter.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.823
Like, it doesn't add up.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.520
Here's the problem, and here's
my experience with Meredith.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.478
I think everything's fine.

12:20.522 --> 12:23.394
Then guess what?
A week or two weeks from now,

12:23.438 --> 12:25.527
she'll be like,
"No, I never said I liked you.

12:25.570 --> 12:28.748
I told you I had problems.
I was drinking that night."

12:28.791 --> 12:29.879
I think you have to
keep an eye on her.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.707
She was your friend last night,

12:31.751 --> 12:33.535
but now she's
with Mary M. Cosby.

12:33.578 --> 12:36.756
Look, the Mary M. Cosby sh--,
okay, I swear to God,

12:36.799 --> 12:40.194
somebody...help me, Jesus,
please.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.849
Mary says the meanest things
to people.

12:42.892 --> 12:46.243
Then she comes back and is like,
"Oh, no, we're good."

12:46.287 --> 12:48.550
- Okay, no, no, hold on, Mary.
- Okay, well, listen,

12:48.593 --> 12:50.682
above and beyond her
saying mean things

12:50.726 --> 12:52.554
and treating us poorly,

12:52.597 --> 12:55.687
Mary <i>has</i> accusations out there
about her church.

12:55.731 --> 12:58.516
There's allegations of Mary
using her power

12:58.560 --> 13:01.389
as the First Lady
to get what she wants.

13:01.432 --> 13:04.566
- But Meredith is fine with that?
- Exactly.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.829
Meredith has a lot of
the same behaviors Mary does,

13:06.873 --> 13:08.875
where it's like,
"I can do and say whatever,

13:08.918 --> 13:12.835
and you all need to accept it
because I'm better than you."

13:12.879 --> 13:14.228
That's how it comes across
to me.

13:14.271 --> 13:15.969
I feel like,
"Just have faith in knowing

13:16.012 --> 13:17.405
what I'm saying is true."

13:17.448 --> 13:18.972
I feel like that's what
Meredith does, too.

13:19.015 --> 13:21.801
So what are we gonna do?

13:23.367 --> 13:25.369
We need to bring it up,
because they'll bring up

13:25.413 --> 13:28.938
whatever they want and speculate
about everyone else.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.897
I know that they damn sure
have done that about me.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.639
We're not gonna sweep it
under the rug.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.350
- Let's go.
- You guys ready?

13:49.393 --> 13:51.439
I'm definitely moving
a little bit slow today.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.267
Yeah.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.399
This is gonna be awesome.

13:55.443 --> 13:59.577
- Have a little relaxation.
- We need this.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.623
- Hi!
- Hi! Welcome.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.625
- Hello.
- We have reservation today.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.757
Okay. Your name, please?

14:05.801 --> 14:08.412
My name is Jennie, Meredith,
and Mary.

14:08.456 --> 14:09.587
Wonderful. If you'd like
to come with me,

14:09.631 --> 14:10.893
I'll take you down
to the locker room,

14:10.937 --> 14:12.677
where you can get changed.
- Okay, awesome.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.766
- Wonderful. Thank you so much.
- Come on down.

14:14.810 --> 14:20.468
After a crazy night
with a lot of wine...

14:20.511 --> 14:21.773
Come on in.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.864
...and very little sleep
for the last few days...

14:24.907 --> 14:27.867
There are robes already
in the lockers for you.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.826
Dress down to your
comfort level, whatever that is.

14:30.870 --> 14:31.914
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:31.958 --> 14:32.959
- You're welcome.
- Thank you so much.

14:33.002 --> 14:35.831
All I have in me is a spa day.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.660
Okay, ladies, go ahead and start
face-down for me.

14:38.703 --> 14:41.619
I've never turned down
a massage. Are you kidding me?

14:41.663 --> 14:45.667
Never. Even if I have
to be with Jennie.

14:45.710 --> 14:48.017
Do your thing, girl.

14:57.722 --> 15:00.638
This is bizarre to me.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.771
Mary is fully dressed
with her sunglasses on.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.947
She cannot fully commit.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.383
She's like, put one foot in
and is like,

15:06.427 --> 15:08.081
"I'm going for a massage,
but I'm fully dressed,

15:08.124 --> 15:12.346
so if you piss me off,
I'm ready to just take off."

15:12.389 --> 15:17.481
Okay, ladies, feel free
to put your robes on.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.005
Thank you. That was awesome.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.528
I needed that.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.965
Ladies, we do have an area
set up outside for you

15:23.009 --> 15:25.794
with some refreshments if you'd
like to have a seat out there.

15:25.837 --> 15:28.971
Thank you. Wonderful.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.930
Let's go. Oh, my gosh.

15:30.973 --> 15:34.020
- I totally fell asleep.
- You did?

15:36.848 --> 15:38.415
- This is so pretty.
- It is so pretty.

15:38.459 --> 15:40.548
I wanna play on the grass.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.550
- How beautiful.
- Nice.

15:42.593 --> 15:45.379
Yesterday was, like, amazing
from the time we started

15:45.422 --> 15:48.556
till the time we went to bed.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.775
I hope there's a duo.
I hope there's an encore.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.387
I just think it was
a great day,

15:53.430 --> 15:55.780
and the dynamic in our group
has shifted...

15:55.824 --> 15:56.999
- Shifted.
- ...a little bit.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.783
And--And that it seems like
everyone's

15:58.827 --> 16:02.004
just trying to be positive,
which is all that matters.

16:03.614 --> 16:04.833
The night--the first night
we got here,

16:04.876 --> 16:06.922
it was really tough
on everybody,

16:06.966 --> 16:08.837
and I feel like that's a lot
of tension.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.754
There are a lot of speculations,
and, yeah, I did share

16:12.797 --> 16:15.409
with Jen a few things about,
you know,

16:15.452 --> 16:18.499
the whole private investigator.

16:18.542 --> 16:21.023
But you took that away from me.

16:21.067 --> 16:24.418
There was no reason for her
to relay that information

16:24.461 --> 16:28.596
unless she was trying to stir
the pot between me and Jen.

16:28.639 --> 16:29.771
Feels like with this group,

16:29.814 --> 16:33.644
it's a continuous bad game
of telephone.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.429
Yeah, I understand.
That's what I'm--

16:35.472 --> 16:37.605
And that was wrong.

16:37.648 --> 16:38.998
But this speaks
to a trust issue, Jennie.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.477
- Mm-hmm.
- You realize that.

16:40.521 --> 16:43.828
Like, you didn't act as
a friend to <i>me.</i>

16:46.527 --> 16:49.051
It wasn't meant to hurt you
or anything like that.

16:49.095 --> 16:52.968
It was brought up, and I should
not have bring it up.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.102
And I wanna apologize.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.626
My intention is not
to hurt you at all.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.845
And I'm gonna draw the line

17:00.889 --> 17:02.456
what I'm gonna say,
what I'm not gonna say.

17:02.499 --> 17:05.676
I'm gonna speak for myself,
and it will never happen again.

17:05.720 --> 17:09.506
Thank you, and I do
appreciate that very much.

17:09.550 --> 17:12.074
Have you guys talked
to your husbands

17:12.118 --> 17:13.554
since you've been here?

17:13.597 --> 17:15.077
Yeah, I did check up on him.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.471
How's he doing?
How are the kids?

17:17.514 --> 17:19.647
They're great. He's a good dad.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.736
But you know,
my issue with my husband--

17:21.779 --> 17:23.259
we're working on it.

17:24.956 --> 17:29.657
Like you mentioned, you refer me
to one of the counselor,

17:29.700 --> 17:31.180
but right now kind of hard

17:31.224 --> 17:33.139
'cause he's so determined
not to go.

17:33.182 --> 17:35.750
- He won't--still won't go?
- Yeah.

17:35.793 --> 17:38.013
I'm hoping that
you would join me

17:38.057 --> 17:39.710
at the couple therapy.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.148
At this moment, I can lie
and say, "Yeah, I'll go,"

17:42.191 --> 17:44.498
but then I'm--
I know deep down inside

17:44.541 --> 17:46.804
I'm not telling the truth.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.937
Never done it. Never will.

17:48.980 --> 17:52.549
If the end of it, he has
to realize that, you know,

17:52.593 --> 17:56.553
it's something he needs to do,
or he's gonna lose his marriage.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.601
How about you, Mary?
Did you talk to Robert?

18:00.644 --> 18:03.691
- I did.
- Awesome.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.736
- How's he doing?
- Yeah, how he's doing?

18:09.610 --> 18:12.700
That side of my life, I'm not
comfortable talking about.

18:12.743 --> 18:16.747
I don't--especially because I
don't really know you like that.

18:16.791 --> 18:20.055
Mm-hmm.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.926
I think I'm gonna excuse myself.

18:23.928 --> 18:27.584
I'm gonna get dressed,
and I'll see you soon.

18:27.628 --> 18:30.065
I don't understand.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.285
All she had to say was,
"He's great. He's fine.

18:32.328 --> 18:34.069
He's doing good."

18:34.113 --> 18:35.940
What's so hard about that?

18:38.987 --> 18:40.075
<i>Coming up...</i>

18:40.119 --> 18:42.121
Lisa constantly lying...

18:42.164 --> 18:43.296
Mary, guess what? Mary, Mary,
let's talk about what's real.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.559
You're the biggest liar
I've ever met.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.735
Your apologies are fake.
Your church is fake.

18:47.778 --> 18:50.172
The way you treat people
is fake. It's all fake.

19:02.576 --> 19:06.145
That was Shah-mazing,
dirty, dirty dude.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.190
Thank you. Thanks.

19:08.234 --> 19:11.454
My God, I'm so tired. Thank you.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.413
Thank you very much.

19:14.762 --> 19:17.504
- I have a sweaty ass.
- "Swass"? I love that.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.076
- Hello!
- Hi!

19:25.120 --> 19:28.210
You guys should--
You guys should see your face.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.298
What's wrong with my face
right now?

19:29.342 --> 19:31.126
Both of you should see
your faces.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.389
What's wrong with my face
right now?

19:34.695 --> 19:36.262
There's no windshield
in that thing.

19:36.305 --> 19:39.613
- I need a shower.
- You guys are, like, filthy.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.223
Okay, I need to take a nap.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.659
I need to go to bed
for a little bit.

19:42.703 --> 19:45.184
- I am so tired.
- See you guys later.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.663
- Bye.
- We'll see you at dinner.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.580
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Where are you at?

19:50.624 --> 19:52.452
<i>I'm just out.</i>

19:52.495 --> 19:56.151
We're having dinner tonight,
and I need to get dressed.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.458
Should I wear a gold dress,
blue dress, or...

19:58.501 --> 20:02.331
Okay, gold or...
gold, blue, or yellow dress?

20:02.375 --> 20:04.115
What color?

20:07.815 --> 20:09.860
Robert?

20:09.904 --> 20:12.341
Bubs?

20:15.301 --> 20:17.651
Was that you urinating?

20:27.704 --> 20:29.140
Heather, are you coming out
this way?

20:29.184 --> 20:30.664
No, I'm gonna come out this way.

20:30.707 --> 20:32.274
Okay.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.497
Oh, my gosh,
this is looking so good.

20:37.540 --> 20:40.239
Looks delicious. What's our ETA?
Should we be ready?

20:40.282 --> 20:41.457
- 8.
- 8?

20:41.501 --> 20:42.545
- Okay.
- Oh, wait.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.243
Do we have time to shower?

20:44.286 --> 20:46.462
- You better.
- You smell like horse.

20:46.506 --> 20:47.681
Just do a French short shower.

20:47.724 --> 20:50.379
It's like the pits
and crevices, you know?

21:02.739 --> 21:05.568
Whoo-hoo!

21:05.612 --> 21:08.397
- Don't be scared. It's just me.
- Hey! You look good.

21:08.441 --> 21:09.659
- Hi, Rheanna.
- How are you?

21:09.703 --> 21:10.704
Oh.

21:10.747 --> 21:13.184
This looks delicious.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.534
You got the mariachi band,

21:14.577 --> 21:16.884
and I'm making up
some margarita tacos.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.320
Delicious.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.670
In honor of Mary calling me
a Mexican thug...

21:20.714 --> 21:23.412
When I think about Jen,
I see a thug.

21:23.456 --> 21:26.372
Like, you know,
those Mexican...people.

21:26.415 --> 21:30.854
I fully embrace that
one-million percent.

21:30.898 --> 21:34.771
Therefore, I am hosting
a Cinco de Mayo party.

21:34.815 --> 21:38.253
So <i>Viva</i> Mexico.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.211
Let's do it! Yes!

21:40.255 --> 21:42.649
Thank you.
See you in a few minutes.

21:42.692 --> 21:43.867
Can I come in?

21:43.911 --> 21:45.347
Yes!

21:45.391 --> 21:46.914
Aw, you look gorge.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.786
- You look hot.
- Thank you.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.702
I am really tired,
but I'm trying to rally.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.356
I know. I'm tired, too.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.358
I think that we don't need
to make this a super late night.

21:56.402 --> 21:59.535
It can be fun. Um, okay,
I've gotta ask you something,

21:59.579 --> 22:01.058
and it's gonna seem
a little strange,

22:01.102 --> 22:03.887
and it's not something I would
normally ever ask someone,

22:03.931 --> 22:07.630
but I'm not sure how else
to deal with it.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.589
- So I have a little dilemma.
- Okay.

22:09.632 --> 22:13.419
I know that, you know,
Jen has stipulated

22:13.462 --> 22:16.857
to the federal government
that she has zero assets.

22:24.691 --> 22:27.520
If she's paying for this dinner
tonight, I can't go.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.348
Wait. Why?
What does that mean?

22:29.391 --> 22:33.395
She said that she has
zero dollars to the government.

22:33.439 --> 22:36.746
So if she's paying
for the dinner tonight,

22:36.790 --> 22:38.400
that's a big problem.

22:40.010 --> 22:44.798
There is a federal indictment
for fraud with Jen,

22:44.841 --> 22:48.802
specifically that she has
illegal money, allegedly,

22:48.845 --> 22:51.413
and if that's how this is
being paid for,

22:51.457 --> 22:53.502
I don't want to get involved
with that.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.286
Honestly, it's just not...
a good thing.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.941
It's not good for <i>her,</i> you know?
It's not good for us.

22:57.985 --> 23:00.030
It's not good for anybody.

23:00.074 --> 23:01.510
I couldn't care less
who's paying normally.

23:01.554 --> 23:04.034
- Yeah. I think, yeah...
- You know that's not

23:04.078 --> 23:05.558
what it's about.
- I think--

23:05.601 --> 23:07.168
It's just about keeping things
clean.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.344
Yeah. My understanding is that
the husbands did pay for it.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.519
Okay.

23:10.563 --> 23:15.611
But... I didn't really ask
any questions.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.613
Okay. Don't--don't worry
about it.

23:17.657 --> 23:20.573
- Whew.
- You were like...

23:20.616 --> 23:22.836
Meredith coming in hot.

23:26.492 --> 23:27.536
<i>Coming up...</i>

23:27.580 --> 23:29.973
All of your husbands
sent us here.

23:30.017 --> 23:32.889
- 'Cause you don't have one.
- you, Mary Cosby.

23:32.933 --> 23:35.805
Who's your husband?
It's your step-granddaddy.

23:35.849 --> 23:36.893
Oh.

23:48.470 --> 23:52.300
Okay, ladies!
It's Cinco de Mayo!

23:52.343 --> 23:54.302
- Where you at?!
- Whoo!

23:54.345 --> 23:57.261
The party train is leaving!
All aboard!

23:57.305 --> 23:58.524
If you wanna see--

23:58.567 --> 24:00.482
Frida Kahlo. Come here.
I have one for you.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.789
- Bitch, yes.
- All right!

24:02.832 --> 24:04.834
It's time for a party!

24:04.878 --> 24:07.924
Come on, party people.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.839
That's what I'm talking about.
----ing show up.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.101
You said show up for the fiesta.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.363
- Show up.
- I got a few for the ladies.

24:12.407 --> 24:13.539
We'll see if they wear 'em,
okay?

24:13.582 --> 24:16.367
You look so cute.
You all look so cute.

24:16.411 --> 24:18.021
Whoo!

24:18.065 --> 24:20.328
I gotta take part
in the party train!

24:20.371 --> 24:21.503
Waiting for my party animal
to get here.

24:21.547 --> 24:22.417
Whoo!

24:22.461 --> 24:25.812
Whoa! Heather! Frida!

24:25.855 --> 24:27.988
You can pick any flower
you want.

24:28.031 --> 24:29.511
Ooh.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.512
I can put it on a little clippy.
I have a headband.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.819
I think the headband's
my color.

24:32.862 --> 24:33.820
Yes.

24:33.863 --> 24:37.954
- Oh, my goodness!
- I can vibe.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.826
Well, I was thinking
I look good like this.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.001
I mean...

24:41.044 --> 24:43.177
This is red and pink
and orange.

24:43.220 --> 24:46.006
I'm actually having a great time
with Heather and Whitney.

24:46.049 --> 24:48.356
Who would've thought Zion
would be sunny skies

24:48.399 --> 24:50.184
and no chance of bad weather?

24:50.227 --> 24:51.533
Okay, are we ready?

24:51.577 --> 24:53.317
You guys, we're doing
a conga line out there.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.885
I wanna be the end.
I'm the caboose.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.540
I think I should be the caboose,
but I'll let it slide.

25:00.542 --> 25:04.546
<i>♪ La cucaracha, la cucaracha</i>

25:04.590 --> 25:07.114
Oh, my gosh, we're eating
in the magic garden.

25:07.157 --> 25:10.030
You guys, look how beautiful
this Cinco de Mayo is.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.080
Yes!

25:17.124 --> 25:20.301
Jen really outdid herself.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.477
The music is calling me.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.567
Girl!

25:28.483 --> 25:32.618
I love being outside.
I love the Mariachi band.

25:34.097 --> 25:36.926
The flowers, the arrangement,
the alcohol.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.406
The alcohol.

25:38.449 --> 25:41.235
I love everything
that she set up.

25:50.157 --> 25:52.638
Gracias. We love you. Mwah!

25:52.681 --> 25:54.378
<i>- Hasta luego.</i> <i>
- Hasta luego.</i>

25:54.422 --> 25:57.120
Committing to slithering.
I got it.

25:57.164 --> 26:00.471
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.606
I don't know what that is.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.608
What is this? These quesadillas?

26:06.652 --> 26:08.131
Quesadilla.

26:08.175 --> 26:11.613
Okay, ladies, I wanna thank
all of you for coming

26:11.657 --> 26:14.050
to our Cinco de Mayo
caliente party.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.138
Aw.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.444
So since you ladies are so hot,

26:16.487 --> 26:17.488
I'm gonna give you something
to cool you down.

26:17.532 --> 26:20.535
- Don't open it.
- Ooh.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.450
- Don't open it?
- Not yet.

26:22.493 --> 26:24.017
Thank you.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.279
I like the box.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.107
They're just a little,
you know...

26:27.150 --> 26:27.977
Ooh, fancy.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.631
Am I getting a key, Jen?

26:30.719 --> 26:32.503
Oh, Jen, it's so pretty.

26:32.547 --> 26:35.289
Can we not open it? Because I'd
really like to look at it.

26:35.332 --> 26:36.507
No, no, no. Don't open it yet.

26:36.551 --> 26:42.122
So I actually was bringing these
to Vail

26:42.165 --> 26:45.125
the day that I did not make it
to Vail.

26:46.387 --> 26:49.390
And it's important to me
for you all to know

26:49.433 --> 26:51.653
that I do care about each
and every one of you.

26:51.697 --> 26:54.482
And I know
the last year and a half

26:54.525 --> 26:56.658
has been difficult with me,

26:56.702 --> 26:58.704
and I appreciate all
of your support.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.009
You can open it.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.666
Oh, it's a snowflake.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.234
We designed snowflakes
because every snowflake

27:07.277 --> 27:09.323
is completely different.

27:09.366 --> 27:12.195
Every snowflake is different,
and every snowflake is fresh.

27:12.239 --> 27:14.676
- I like that.
- I think that's a good idea.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.723
But there's six diamonds on,
like, the actual chain

27:17.766 --> 27:19.289
for the six of you,

27:19.333 --> 27:21.727
and then I'm the big diamond
in the middle, obviously.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.424
And the most unique.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.469
Thank you, Jen.
That's very kind.

27:25.513 --> 27:28.429
Yeah, thank you very much.

27:28.472 --> 27:32.302
Meredith is accepting the gift.
I'm shocked.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.435
She didn't even wanna come
to the dinner.

27:35.784 --> 27:39.353
Enough of that.
Let's do a toast.

27:39.396 --> 27:42.704
Cheers to all
of my little snowflakes.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.010
That's for everyone.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.099
I gotta run in the house
for a second.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.709
I wanna go back.

27:50.407 --> 27:51.495
Wow.

27:51.539 --> 27:54.368
Thanks, lady of service.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.589
I can't do this. I'm freezing.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.200
Where's Mary going?

28:00.243 --> 28:02.245
She said she wanted to go inside
and get warm.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.508
And then Whitney asked her if
she could bring some blankets

28:04.552 --> 28:06.641
when she comes back,
and she said no.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.034
- Oh.
- She did?

28:08.077 --> 28:10.166
I don't really care
if she comes back...

28:10.210 --> 28:11.646
What's there to be upset about?

28:11.690 --> 28:13.474
...because she's being
kind of a buzz kill, honestly.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.650
She was a little like that
at the spa, too, so...

28:15.694 --> 28:17.783
- She was--
- She was a little bit of a...

28:17.826 --> 28:20.220
Yeah, because Meredith asked
how was my husband,

28:20.263 --> 28:22.570
how was my kids and, you know,
I thought it was very nice

28:22.613 --> 28:24.790
asking my family
how we were doing,

28:24.833 --> 28:28.750
then Meredith asked about
Robert, and she was like,

28:28.794 --> 28:30.752
"Oh, I don't wanna talk
about it. This is personal.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.493
I don't really know her,"
which is me.

28:32.536 --> 28:34.364
- What's personal?
- Her family.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.627
Like, oh, okay, that's fine.
I'm not gonna...

28:36.671 --> 28:38.673
And I, like, well, you apo--
Well, to me, I feel like

28:38.717 --> 28:41.502
you apologized, I thought you
wanted to get to know me more.

28:41.545 --> 28:44.461
So that's why it caught me
off-guard when she said that.

28:44.505 --> 28:45.767
- Yeah, she did apologize to you.
- It's okay.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.769
- So I would think that, too.
- Yeah.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.774
I can understand why she would
feel uncomfortable.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.254
- Why?
- I probably...

28:54.297 --> 28:55.734
Well, because they don't know
each other all that well,

28:55.777 --> 28:58.388
and Jennie was talking about
some personal things

28:58.432 --> 29:01.435
that we had talked about
previously.

29:01.478 --> 29:04.090
I was opening up.
I wanna share some things.

29:04.133 --> 29:05.787
- I'm just gonna grab that.
- I'm kind of reaching out.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.354
You know? It's like every time
I didn't talk--

29:07.397 --> 29:10.183
Well, I think she felt like
you were talking, too,

29:10.226 --> 29:11.401
which obviously you were,

29:11.445 --> 29:13.316
because you don't know her
all that well.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.796
- Mm-hmm.
- If you were one-on-one

29:14.840 --> 29:17.233
with Mary, that conversation
would've never come up.

29:17.277 --> 29:19.148
Because she...

29:21.629 --> 29:24.371
Yeah. I don't think the apology
was sincere.

29:24.414 --> 29:27.722
See, you apologize,
don't do it again.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.115
I don't like being in the cycle
of abuse.

29:29.158 --> 29:30.290
You guys, it looks like
she's walking back,

29:30.333 --> 29:32.814
so you guys can speak directly
to her

29:32.858 --> 29:34.468
and let her speak for herself.
- Yeah.

29:44.304 --> 29:45.784
I don't like being
in a cycle of abuse.

29:45.827 --> 29:46.915
You guys, looks like she's
walking back.

29:46.959 --> 29:48.787
- That's okay.
- So you guys can speak

29:48.830 --> 29:50.876
directly to her.
- Yeah.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.269
You guys got a blanket?
What's this?

29:53.313 --> 29:54.357
Yeah.

29:57.012 --> 29:59.101
- Are you warm? Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm sweating.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.624
- Warm-hearted.
- You know, out here,

30:00.668 --> 30:03.149
the summer desert
is, like, hot.

30:06.195 --> 30:08.110
- Thank you.
- Ah! Rheanna.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.633
- Oh, put it on this charger?
- Wow.

30:09.677 --> 30:12.854
- Delicious. I'm excited.
- Oh, those look amazing.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.856
- Thank you.
- Good.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.640
- So, Jennie...
- Yes, ma'am.

30:16.684 --> 30:19.948
You know, I just wanna get to
the bottom of, like...

30:19.992 --> 30:21.645
what you were saying earlier,

30:21.689 --> 30:22.951
'cause we stopped
talking about it.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.911
We should continue
because I don't feel right.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.390
Mary, do you like Jennie?

30:30.872 --> 30:32.178
No.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.921
But you don't have
to be rude to me, though.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.270
I'm not trying to be rude
to you.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.881
I personally think you're rude.

30:39.925 --> 30:42.405
- Like, that's just me.
- How am I rude? How am I rude?

30:42.449 --> 30:43.842
Just the way
you blurt out things.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.669
You need to toughen up,
sweetheart.

30:45.713 --> 30:46.975
Okay, can we stop
and have some fun?

30:47.019 --> 30:48.890
Shut the up
and let's go!

30:48.934 --> 30:50.979
Don't ever use that word
with me, you...

30:51.023 --> 30:53.808
- I did not talk about you.
- Mary is so full of sh--!

30:53.852 --> 30:55.418
- I sure did. Jen--
- You talk about this

30:55.462 --> 30:57.681
as much we did.
Don't lie, Mary.

30:57.725 --> 30:59.379
Well, I think you're very rude,
to me because--

30:59.422 --> 31:01.860
Well, I didn't ask you.
I don't really care. I'm--

31:01.903 --> 31:03.122
Oh, you don't care that
you're rude to me.

31:03.165 --> 31:05.298
I didn't ask your opinion.
I don't care.

31:05.341 --> 31:06.299
No, no, opinion or not,
it is a fact.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.866
You are rude to me.

31:07.909 --> 31:10.085
Ask anybody here. They see it.

31:12.174 --> 31:13.872
Is she rude to me?
Just be honest.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.699
- You can say it.
- I mean, whenever--

31:15.743 --> 31:17.136
whenever she started talking,
you kind of walked

31:17.179 --> 31:18.354
out of the kitchen, you said,
"I'm not interested

31:18.398 --> 31:19.965
in anything she has to say."

31:20.008 --> 31:21.705
That was uncomfortable 'cause
we're all friends and moms,

31:21.749 --> 31:24.883
and you know, her husband
pitched in for the trip, too.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.449
What do you mean
her husband pit--

31:26.493 --> 31:28.974
You mean her husband pitched in,
too? What does that mean?

31:29.017 --> 31:31.193
- Paid for the trip.
- Yeah.

31:31.237 --> 31:32.368
'Cause you don't have one,
so what does that--

31:32.412 --> 31:34.109
What's that got to do
with anything?

31:36.416 --> 31:38.940
- Why would you say that, Mary?
- Well, 'cause I want to.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.202
You think I'm under
the impression

31:40.246 --> 31:41.900
that I have a husband?

31:41.943 --> 31:44.032
No, I'm just saying why would
you mention her husband?

31:46.078 --> 31:47.949
you, Mary Cosby.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.996
Who's your husband?
It's your step-granddaddy.

31:54.913 --> 31:58.046
I'm gonna sit back
and drink my margarita

31:58.090 --> 32:00.875
and leave this--leave this
to everyone else to discuss,

32:00.919 --> 32:03.356
'cause I already said this
a year ago.

32:03.399 --> 32:04.966
- Relax. Relax.
- I'm not gonna relax.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.446
Yeah, relax. Don't--I--

32:06.489 --> 32:07.882
You don't need to say
mean things to me.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.144
You have an issue with me,
though.

32:09.188 --> 32:10.493
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do. Yeah, you do.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.408
I'm just sitting here talking.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.456
What happened
between last night and today

32:16.499 --> 32:18.066
and this morning in spa,
because--

32:18.110 --> 32:20.851
Well, her apology's not sincere.
I'm just letting you know that.

32:20.895 --> 32:22.418
You're just gonna have
to live with it, then,

32:22.462 --> 32:23.942
'cause I'm not doing any more
than that.

32:23.985 --> 32:25.204
What is your problem with me?

32:25.247 --> 32:26.596
I don't have a problem with you.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.033
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
- I don't wanna know you.

32:28.076 --> 32:30.383
- I don't really care.
- Meredith, that's not kind.

32:30.426 --> 32:31.950
That's not kind. Like, I don't
want her to feel bad.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.995
I don't want her to feel bad.
Her, me, you, or Jennie.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.215
- It's not kind.
- What is it you want from me?

32:36.258 --> 32:38.086
No, I'm just saying,
we need to point it out.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.393
Well, then treat everybody
the same, Lisa.

32:40.436 --> 32:42.961
Stick up for her
and do the same for me.

32:43.004 --> 32:45.354
Like, be consistent.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.226
What just triggered you
just right now?

32:47.269 --> 32:50.098
I'm just saying,
like, be consistent.

32:50.142 --> 32:52.100
'Cause you weren't consistent
with me.

32:52.144 --> 32:54.276
Don't roll your eyes
and don't do that.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.408
This is not getting
turned on me.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.236
I'm a great friend
to everybody here.

32:57.279 --> 32:58.802
Oh, you're a great friend to me

32:58.846 --> 33:00.500
when all the accusations
went public?

33:00.543 --> 33:02.850
Yes, I was a good friend to you
and I still am a good friend.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.287
- So not calling me?
- I'm authentic, Jen.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.028
This is, like, crazy.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.812
This isn't about me and you
right now,

33:08.856 --> 33:10.466
so I don't know where
we're going--this direction.

33:10.510 --> 33:13.339
It's okay, it's okay,
this is not about you.

33:13.382 --> 33:16.559
Who is there for ----ing me?
Because nobody is there for me!

33:16.603 --> 33:17.996
- I was, Lisa.
- You know what, Jen?

33:18.039 --> 33:19.432
And I have been your friend,
too.

33:19.475 --> 33:21.129
This is not getting turned
on me. I'm sorry.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.001
This is not about me.

33:23.044 --> 33:26.830
You know what? It's like...

33:26.874 --> 33:29.398
Right now
I'm at my breaking point.

33:29.442 --> 33:32.314
I have been nothing
but a good and loyal friend

33:32.358 --> 33:36.318
to both Meredith and Jen,
but I am so sick

33:36.362 --> 33:39.321
of emotionally coddling
two grown women

33:39.365 --> 33:42.498
that have issues that they
will not resolve,

33:42.542 --> 33:44.848
and I'm sick of it
becoming a problem for me.

33:44.892 --> 33:47.416
Jen is triggered.
Let her have her moment.

33:51.377 --> 33:52.334
No, no, no, because of
my friendship with you.

33:52.378 --> 33:54.162
It's like I'm constantly like,

33:54.206 --> 33:56.295
do I have to choose one
or the other? I'm not choosing.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.514
- I'm being nice to everybody.
- Then do what you wanna do.

33:58.558 --> 34:02.605
I do not understand where
Lisa Barlow is coming from.

34:02.649 --> 34:05.869
She doesn't stand up for me.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.610
What kind of support
do you want?

34:07.654 --> 34:09.569
- I'm not choosing.
- I'm being nice to everybody.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.527
No, I've never told you
to do anything.

34:11.571 --> 34:12.659
No, I'm saying because she's--

34:12.702 --> 34:13.921
she's thinking
I'm a double standard

34:13.964 --> 34:15.488
because I just stuck up for her,

34:15.531 --> 34:16.619
and she wants me to stick up
for her. That's what it is.

34:16.663 --> 34:18.447
- You are.
- I am not, Mary.

34:18.491 --> 34:20.145
- I'm kind to everyone.
- No, you're not.

34:20.188 --> 34:22.147
Mary, you're fake as
That's what you are.

34:22.190 --> 34:23.322
You're fake. You say
you're sorry all the time,

34:23.365 --> 34:24.888
and then you do
the same thing over,

34:24.932 --> 34:27.543
and it's this cycle of abuse.
I'm out of that cycle.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.371
You can say whatever you want.
Doesn't mean anything.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.460
And you're real? You don't
even know how to be real.

34:31.504 --> 34:32.983
- You wasn't taught.
- You don't know what's real.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.376
- Everything about's you fake.
- Let's not go there.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.422
You're still eating candy.

34:36.465 --> 34:38.163
Mary, don't worry about my diet.

34:38.206 --> 34:39.599
- Don't worry about my diet.
- It's who you are.

34:39.642 --> 34:41.296
I'm not interested in what
you think about my diet.

34:41.340 --> 34:42.906
You live in a lie.
You live in a bubble.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.299
- Your whole life is fake.
- Do not go there.

34:44.343 --> 34:46.084
You live at Taco Bell,
for crying out loud.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.259
Oh, my God.

34:47.302 --> 34:48.303
What's wrong with eating
at Taco Bell?!

34:48.347 --> 34:49.609
You raised these kids
on Taco Bell.

34:49.652 --> 34:52.090
- I love Taco Bell!
- Who does that?

34:52.133 --> 34:54.527
I love Taco Bell,
and I also love fine dining,

34:54.570 --> 34:56.050
and I think that--
- Yeah, well, your kids

34:56.094 --> 34:57.921
and yourself and your husband
needs nutrients

34:57.965 --> 35:01.621
I think the love of fast food
just shows she's not--

35:01.664 --> 35:03.579
she has no depth.

35:03.623 --> 35:07.583
She doesn't really look
at the importance of life.

35:07.627 --> 35:09.672
Just saying.

35:09.716 --> 35:12.110
Meredith, is this okay?
She's so nice. She's so nice.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.286
She's kind.

35:14.329 --> 35:16.418
Your own self said
no one's here for you,

35:16.462 --> 35:18.942
and then you turn to me
to stand up for you.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.379
I'm--I don't need you
to stand up for me.

35:20.422 --> 35:22.250
- I've been doing that, so...
- I don't need for you

35:22.294 --> 35:23.599
to stand up for me.
I got it, though.

35:23.643 --> 35:26.167
- Lisa, stop constantly lying.
- Mary, guess what?

35:26.211 --> 35:27.516
You're the biggest liar
I've ever met.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.604
Mary, Mary, let's talk
about what's real.

35:28.648 --> 35:29.997
You are fake in everything
you do.

35:30.040 --> 35:30.867
There is--everything about you
is fake.

35:30.911 --> 35:32.173
I was told anything you do--

35:32.217 --> 35:33.479
Lisa, you need to work
on yourself.

35:33.522 --> 35:34.871
Your apologies are fake.
Your church is fake.

35:34.915 --> 35:37.135
The way you treat people
is fake. It's all fake.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.571
You need to work on yourself.

35:38.614 --> 35:41.182
Lisa Barlow is
an amazing human being.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.315
Mary, I am authentic.
I am real.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.186
Everything I say I own, I own.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.362
Let's go look up your stuff.
Let's go look up Mary Cosby.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.103
What stuff?
You don't even know me.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.714
Girl, go somewhere. You called
somebody from my church.

35:51.758 --> 35:55.501
"Why is Mary... What's Mary..."
Lisa, back up

35:55.544 --> 35:58.330
and--and--and meet
your high standards

35:58.373 --> 36:00.506
that don't nobody know
what they are, because--

36:00.549 --> 36:02.160
Yes, let's talk about
my character,

36:02.203 --> 36:03.813
because that's where you
can't call it to question.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.554
- Yours is a little different.
- I don't care what you think.

36:05.598 --> 36:06.990
My whole congregation
don't even like you.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.253
I can't even invite you
to my church.

36:08.296 --> 36:09.732
You don't even have
a congregation.

36:09.776 --> 36:11.299
They're all leaving because
they don't understand...

36:11.343 --> 36:12.605
- Do I have a congregation?
- ...what they're even praying to

36:12.648 --> 36:15.434
or who they're praying to.
Let's not go there.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.526
Do I have a congregation,
Whitney?

36:20.569 --> 36:23.137
You was at my church.
You saw them.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.531
- Yeah, I did.
- And you will never come.

36:25.574 --> 36:28.142
Mary, I'm not interested
in going to your church.

36:42.983 --> 36:44.245
You will never come.

36:44.289 --> 36:46.639
Mary, I'm not interested
in going to your church.

36:46.682 --> 36:49.816
I don't invite the Devil
to my church.

36:49.859 --> 36:50.860
- Everything you say is a lie.
- Okay.

36:50.904 --> 36:52.471
I'm done with this.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.690
Jen, where are you at?
I need you to get this little--

36:54.734 --> 36:58.172
this little chihuahua
out of here.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.219
- Happy Cinco de Mayo!
- ...de Mayo!

37:01.262 --> 37:03.090
Oh, my God.
I'm not doing this tonight.

37:05.266 --> 37:06.746
Here she comes.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.878
Hey, welcome back.

37:10.184 --> 37:12.099
Jen, listen,
I know Lisa hurt you,

37:12.142 --> 37:15.842
but she's trying to show up
for you now. She really is.

37:15.885 --> 37:18.497
You've been hurt, and we could
have shown up better,

37:18.540 --> 37:23.110
but we're showing up now.
I think that's fair.

37:23.153 --> 37:25.068
- It's not about me. Let's just--
- Listen, you know what?

37:25.112 --> 37:28.028
It is about you. It's about
Mary, you, Jennie, Heather,

37:28.071 --> 37:30.639
Whitney, me, and Meredith.
It's about all of us.

37:30.683 --> 37:34.643
I mean, I am concerned how
we're gonna navigate this.

37:34.687 --> 37:35.818
What's really clear--you aren't
really interested

37:35.862 --> 37:37.820
in being friends with Jennie.

37:37.864 --> 37:41.041
I don't think it's something
you need to be concerned about.

37:41.084 --> 37:43.565
- I really don't.
- Well, I am.

37:45.741 --> 37:47.265
Just say it, Mary.
Don't mumble.

37:47.308 --> 37:49.745
If you have something
to say to me, say it to me.

37:49.789 --> 37:52.095
I don't know.
You just get on my nerves.

37:52.139 --> 37:55.621
Oh, then leave. If I get
on your nerves, then leave.

37:55.664 --> 37:58.014
Because you get
on everybody's nerve.

37:59.755 --> 38:01.540
Yeah, you know what? You're
a woman of God? Don't do that.

38:01.583 --> 38:02.671
What are you a woman of?
What are you a woman of?

38:02.715 --> 38:04.151
I didn't claim to be
a woman of God.

38:04.194 --> 38:05.283
- It's a good thing you don't.
- I claim to be a mom...

38:05.326 --> 38:07.197
- Good.
- ...as you, okay?

38:07.241 --> 38:08.590
- Yeah.
- So I don't go...

38:08.634 --> 38:09.983
...like the way you do.

38:10.026 --> 38:11.114
- You don't even know me.
- I don't care to know you.

38:11.158 --> 38:12.899
And you don't even know <i>me</i>
at all.

38:12.942 --> 38:14.553
And then you go back
and tell Jen about Meredith.

38:14.596 --> 38:15.728
- So how is that anything--
- You're asking me

38:15.771 --> 38:16.816
why I don't like you.
You're a mess.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.078
- I don't like you either!
- Good.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.645
Because I don't like the way
you behave.

38:19.688 --> 38:20.907
I don't like the way you talk.

38:20.950 --> 38:23.997
I don't like the way
you treat my friends.

38:24.040 --> 38:27.261
- I don't like doing this. Like--
- Mary, the point is

38:27.305 --> 38:29.916
is that it's really complicated
and confusing

38:29.959 --> 38:32.614
when you have a church
and you treat us this way.

38:34.747 --> 38:37.184
- Doesn't God love everyone?
- Yeah, He does.

38:37.227 --> 38:39.621
That's what doesn't make sense,
Mary, is when you're saying

38:39.665 --> 38:41.275
that you run a church--
- You guys can go to Jesus,

38:41.319 --> 38:43.712
the church, the woman of God.
You can do all that.

38:43.756 --> 38:44.931
- Mary. Mary.
- That isn't about me.

38:44.974 --> 38:46.324
The way you're on that pole
upside down,

38:46.367 --> 38:48.587
you should never try
to call me out on who I am.

38:48.630 --> 38:50.632
Yeah, God taught me how
to do that.

38:52.634 --> 38:54.375
You have a church.
You have a congregation.

38:54.419 --> 38:55.681
Okay, Whitney. Thank you.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.987
And you're telling us
we don't matter.

38:58.031 --> 39:00.729
- Everyone matters to God.
- I can't take you guys.

39:00.773 --> 39:02.122
This is too much.

39:02.165 --> 39:03.950
What, so because
I'm a woman of God,

39:03.993 --> 39:06.256
she's allowed to disrespect me,

39:06.300 --> 39:08.258
and I'm not allowed to take up
for myself and respond?

39:08.302 --> 39:10.304
What do you mean?

39:10.348 --> 39:11.827
We're all God's creatures,
right?

39:11.871 --> 39:15.614
So I don't know why I have to be
held to a higher standard.

39:15.657 --> 39:18.138
They're not nice to me.
They're really not.

39:18.181 --> 39:20.793
I am saying, you have a church.

39:20.836 --> 39:22.403
- Thank you, Whitney.
- Okay, I got it.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.797
You said it three times.
I understood it. Can we move on?

39:24.840 --> 39:26.886
No.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.367
'Cause you don't wanna be
friends with Jennie,

39:29.410 --> 39:31.238
and she's my friend, and I don't
know how to be here...

39:31.281 --> 39:32.935
It's okay.
Don't worry about it, then.

39:32.979 --> 39:34.154
...with someone who doesn't
wanna be friends with...

39:34.197 --> 39:35.416
- Okay, let's--
- I don't understand

39:35.460 --> 39:37.723
why you don't wanna be friends
with Jennie.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.072
And I'm gonna use...

39:39.115 --> 39:40.682
Mary, what you said
is important.

39:40.726 --> 39:42.989
- What was she saying?
- 'Cause it's honest.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.686
So say it so everybody
can hear.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.253
- I wanna hear. I didn't hear it.
- Which part?

39:46.296 --> 39:47.689
You don't feel like
we are real friends, right?

39:47.733 --> 39:51.737
I don't, none of us, no.
Not outside of Meredith.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.174
Why only with Meredith?

39:54.217 --> 39:56.698
I say Meredith because
when we're together

39:56.742 --> 39:58.308
we don't talk about them.

39:58.352 --> 40:00.789
We have nothing rude to say
about any of these girls.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.704
I have a question, Meredith,

40:02.748 --> 40:05.794
'cause you exude leading
with love and kindness.

40:05.838 --> 40:07.840
- Thank you.
- But she does not.

40:07.883 --> 40:09.668
So can you help me understand?

40:09.711 --> 40:12.453
'Cause you have a friend
of 10 years here.

40:15.064 --> 40:18.241
Everybody has
a different dynamic.

40:18.285 --> 40:22.898
If I think that Mary's doing
something wrong, I tell her.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.726
You sat here
and you heard her say

40:24.770 --> 40:26.859
that she doesn't wanna be
her friend. She doesn't matter.

40:26.902 --> 40:28.861
Do I think that's a nice thing
to say? No, I don't.

40:28.904 --> 40:31.167
- Then stand up.
- But everybody is entitled

40:31.211 --> 40:32.952
to say what they want to be
friends with someone or don't.

40:32.995 --> 40:34.432
That's okay.

40:34.475 --> 40:37.870
This is so upsetting to me
because you turn a blind eye

40:37.913 --> 40:42.265
to the way everybody treats me,
but one word about Mary,

40:42.309 --> 40:45.355
and you're, like, ready to
defend her at all costs.

40:45.399 --> 40:47.401
That's kind of jerky, you know,
like...

40:47.445 --> 40:50.056
Stop being so judgmental.
You're so perfect.

40:50.099 --> 40:52.798
Don't say that, Mary.
That is not what I'm saying.

40:52.841 --> 40:56.279
Well, I think you matter,
and you matter to me, okay?

40:56.323 --> 40:58.717
But I can't speak
for somebody else.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.067
I don't control
what anyone else does.

41:01.110 --> 41:03.243
That being said, I do wanna
apologize to everyone

41:03.286 --> 41:06.246
for screaming and yelling
and acting

41:06.289 --> 41:07.769
like a complete lunatic
yesterday.

41:07.813 --> 41:10.903
I was hurt and I reacted,
and I am sorry.

41:16.125 --> 41:19.738
You know, no matter what Mary
does, Meredith has her back.

41:19.781 --> 41:21.914
That's what I want from
my friendship with Meredith.

41:21.957 --> 41:25.831
You don't have to speak for me.
Just have my back.

41:25.874 --> 41:31.314
Lisa had reason to...suspect
to us that...

41:31.358 --> 41:33.055
the memorial did not happen.

41:33.099 --> 41:35.797
Did you have a memorial
with your father?

41:38.583 --> 41:40.541
I'm not even warranting that
with an answer, Whitney.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.761
Do not even go here with me.

41:42.804 --> 41:46.242
It's gonna go very ugly
very fast.

41:49.811 --> 41:52.379
- It's not how--
- None of your ----ing business.

42:06.436 --> 42:09.309
- Meredith...
- This is my father. Stop it!

42:09.352 --> 42:12.181
I'm not trying
to disrespect you.

42:12.225 --> 42:13.835
Yes, I did, Whitney!

42:13.879 --> 42:15.402
- Okay, that's all I wanted.
- Yes.

42:15.445 --> 42:17.012
I think I've had enough.
Good night.

42:17.056 --> 42:18.318
Meredith, no, I'm not trying
to disrespect you, Meredith.

42:18.361 --> 42:20.886
I am finished.
No, you didn't get it yesterday.

42:20.929 --> 42:24.193
- Don't talk about my family!
- I'm not talking

42:24.237 --> 42:27.153
about your family.
- Done. My dead father? No.

42:27.196 --> 42:31.374
- I'm asking you.
- No. And no. Goodbye.

42:35.378 --> 42:36.423
That's horrible.

42:36.466 --> 42:40.862
- Why?
- I mean, what the [bleep]?
