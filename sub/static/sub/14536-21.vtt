WEBVTT

00:07.574 --> 00:08.826
All right, I'm in. I just
have to locate the intel

00:08.850 --> 00:10.442
and I'll be out
in less than five.

00:10.477 --> 00:13.629
You know, as long as
no one stops...

00:13.664 --> 00:16.281
Uh-oh.

00:16.316 --> 00:17.141
How y'all doin'?
( nervous laugh )

00:17.176 --> 00:21.027
I was just here to, you know,
pay my electric bill.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.574
Can you guys, um, direct me
to Accounts Payable?

00:22.598 --> 00:24.706
Okay, chill.

00:24.742 --> 00:26.374
Chill, all right?

00:26.409 --> 00:28.810
I was only a few days late.

00:30.606 --> 00:32.764
MEN: ( groan )

00:32.800 --> 00:34.440
Oh, look at that.
Now your lights are out.

00:42.050 --> 00:44.210
Oh, man, did the DVR cut out?
I hate when that happens.

00:49.066 --> 00:50.765
All right, fine.
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.792
They were on to me,
I had no choice but to bolt.

00:52.827 --> 00:55.203
How could you completely
fail your mission?

00:55.238 --> 00:56.996
Uh, wait. I'm still alive.

00:57.032 --> 00:59.566
So, technically,
I didn't completely fail.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.243
I only half-failed.

01:01.278 --> 01:04.012
Which means I also
half-succeeded.

01:04.047 --> 01:06.147
So, if you round up,
one could argue that

01:06.182 --> 01:08.825
I completely succeeded.

01:08.861 --> 01:12.771
I want answers, KC.
This was a simple mission.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.446
Says the guy who hasn't been on a
field mission in, what, 50 years?

01:15.609 --> 01:17.242
Forty years?

01:17.278 --> 01:18.278
( Mouthing )

01:20.039 --> 01:21.216
All I'm saying is
it wasn't my fault.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.458
- They knew I was coming.
- How could they have known?

01:24.535 --> 01:26.296
This was a top secret mission.
It was off the books!

01:26.320 --> 01:28.045
Off the books?!

01:28.080 --> 01:29.821
I swear they were
reading a book called:

01:29.856 --> 01:32.999
<i>KC Will Be Here At 6:15.</i>

01:33.034 --> 01:36.386
Are you saying someone
leaked information?

01:36.422 --> 01:38.371
Everyone out.

01:38.406 --> 01:39.831
Glad that's over.

01:39.866 --> 01:42.726
Not you. You stay.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.237
So you can apologize in private
for yelling at me

01:45.272 --> 01:46.272
in front of everybody?

01:48.066 --> 01:49.066
Guess not.

01:52.579 --> 01:56.205
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:56.241 --> 01:59.334
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

01:59.370 --> 02:03.488
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

02:03.523 --> 02:06.975
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

02:07.010 --> 02:10.837
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

02:10.872 --> 02:13.215
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

02:13.250 --> 02:17.185
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

02:17.221 --> 02:20.980
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:21.016 --> 02:23.225
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:23.260 --> 02:25.243
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:25.278 --> 02:27.720
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:27.756 --> 02:29.915
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:29.950 --> 02:31.717
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:31.752 --> 02:33.835
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:33.870 --> 02:36.638
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:36.673 --> 02:37.750
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:37.774 --> 02:40.066
I keep it undercover.

02:40.102 --> 02:41.102
I keep it undercover.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.633
Are you suggesting there's
a mole inside the Organization

02:48.669 --> 02:50.593
leaking classified information?

02:50.629 --> 02:53.455
No, you're suggesting
there's a mole.

02:53.490 --> 02:57.726
My suggestion is next time
you do an interrogation,

02:57.761 --> 02:59.814
you might wanna floss, 'cause you
got enough spinach in your teeth

02:59.838 --> 03:00.745
to bake a quiche, my friend.

03:00.780 --> 03:03.581
Yeah.

03:03.616 --> 03:06.368
Noted.

03:06.403 --> 03:07.580
I'm putting you in charge
of finding the mole.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.479
Wait, me?

03:09.514 --> 03:10.917
Yep, you better
get on it right away.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.065
Okay, you got it, sir.

03:12.100 --> 03:15.277
But remember, trust no one.

03:15.312 --> 03:18.639
All right, but if
I can't trust anyone,

03:18.674 --> 03:20.632
then how do I know
I can trust you?

03:20.667 --> 03:22.500
- You can trust me!
- Oh, really?

03:22.536 --> 03:24.280
'Cause that sounds
like something a mole would say.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.121
KC, do I look like a mole?

03:26.156 --> 03:28.048
I don't know.
I've never seen one before.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.724
Or have I?

03:29.760 --> 03:30.683
Get out.

03:30.719 --> 03:32.244
Yes, sir.

03:33.989 --> 03:34.989
Or, yes, mole.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.214
( Groans ) Agent Johnson
just assigned me

03:45.250 --> 03:48.526
another top secret case.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.012
Guess I'll be doing
all the work around here.

03:53.883 --> 03:56.701
I'm kidding. We all play
an equally important role.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.294
All right?

03:58.329 --> 03:59.888
What would we do without Ray

03:59.923 --> 04:01.481
ruining our coffee
every morning?

04:01.517 --> 04:02.677
Give it up for Ray, everybody!

04:02.701 --> 04:04.233
Yeah! Ray!

04:04.269 --> 04:07.037
Whoo! All right, well,

04:07.114 --> 04:10.373
I'm gonna head down to
the Olive Pit all by myself

04:10.408 --> 04:13.201
and look over these
highly-classified

04:13.237 --> 04:16.312
sought-after files. All right.

04:16.348 --> 04:21.134
Oh, um, Ray, that's actually a soil
sample from the Fresno mission.

04:21.169 --> 04:23.962
It's not ground coffee,
just... ground.

04:30.713 --> 04:32.229
Hey, Ernie. Not that you asked,

04:32.264 --> 04:34.598
but I'm working at the school's
pop-up clothing sale.

04:34.633 --> 04:38.284
We are selling gently used clothes
to raise money for charity.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.228
Hmm. It's cool you
decided to volunteer.

04:40.264 --> 04:43.857
Volunteer? More like volun-told.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.675
Vice Principal Wysocki
is making me do it.

04:45.711 --> 04:49.204
- Why?
- I don't know, something about not paying attention in class.

04:49.239 --> 04:50.399
Honestly, I wasn't listening.

04:52.142 --> 04:54.918
Anyway, we need more
guys' clothes

04:54.953 --> 04:56.619
and I don't wanna ask
anyone I'm dating,

04:56.655 --> 04:58.463
have dated or might date,

04:58.498 --> 05:00.423
so that leaves... you.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.525
Um... what do you got?

05:02.560 --> 05:05.378
Well, since it's for charity,
help yourself.

05:06.831 --> 05:08.673
Oh.

05:11.102 --> 05:14.496
Attention, everyone.

05:14.531 --> 05:17.858
Don't bother bringing anymore
clothes to the pop-up sale,

05:17.893 --> 05:20.518
we now have Ernie's
sweaty gym shorts!

05:22.797 --> 05:24.998
No need to get any closer,

05:25.034 --> 05:26.874
I'm sure you can smell them
from where you are.

05:28.654 --> 05:30.645
Point taken!

05:30.680 --> 05:33.248
I'll check my dad's closet.

05:33.283 --> 05:35.008
He's got a couple coats
he never wears.

05:35.044 --> 05:37.627
Okay, good. Oh, and since
we need more menswear,

05:37.662 --> 05:39.182
you might wanna check
KC's closet, too.

05:49.032 --> 05:51.174
( Glasses beep )

05:54.337 --> 05:56.120
Well, well, well.
Look who we have here.

05:56.155 --> 05:57.964
Agents McKenzie and Garcia.

05:57.999 --> 06:00.566
- Oh, hey, girl.
- Hey.

06:00.602 --> 06:02.251
I'm on to you.

06:02.287 --> 06:05.313
Do us a favor, KC,

06:05.348 --> 06:07.444
don't tell anyone you saw
us here, we could get fired.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.495
Oh, no, no, no, you guys are
gonna get more than fired.

06:09.519 --> 06:11.970
You two are going to prison,
you lowlifes.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.389
Prison? Sure, agents aren't
supposed to date each other,

06:14.424 --> 06:16.607
but what Johnson doesn't know
won't hurt him.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.334
It's not like what
we're doing is illegal.

06:18.369 --> 06:20.711
No, no, no. You two are here

06:20.747 --> 06:22.875
because I planted a seed that
I had sensitive information

06:22.899 --> 06:24.857
and you two moles took the bait.

06:24.892 --> 06:26.843
The only crime committed here

06:26.878 --> 06:28.711
was when Agent McKenzie
stole my heart.

06:30.907 --> 06:33.249
- Uh-uh-uh! Uh!
- Oh!

06:33.285 --> 06:35.176
I don't believe
any of that for a second!

06:35.211 --> 06:38.137
Now...

06:38.173 --> 06:42.233
can you explain to me
why $20,000

06:42.269 --> 06:44.038
would be wired to your account
and then withdrawn the next day?

06:44.062 --> 06:45.982
Yeah, that's right. I got
information, my friend.

06:48.133 --> 06:50.108
Are you laundering money?

06:50.143 --> 06:51.604
Maybe funding a terrorist
organization?

06:51.628 --> 06:54.045
Or perhaps you guys are lighting
the cash on fire

06:54.081 --> 06:55.641
because you two
are a couple of maniacs!

06:55.674 --> 06:57.916
Maniacs!

06:57.951 --> 07:01.344
( Sarcastic ) Yeah,
we're the maniacs.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.463
Not that it's any
of your business,

07:03.498 --> 07:05.264
but my grandmother
loaned me the money.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.009
And why would your grandmother
loan you $20,000?

07:08.044 --> 07:09.085
( Sighs ) To buy this.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.123
Was gonna wait
till after dinner, but...

07:13.158 --> 07:16.384
Lori... will you marry me?

07:17.879 --> 07:19.862
No!

07:19.897 --> 07:24.484
You had to borrow money from
your grandmother to buy a ring?

07:24.561 --> 07:26.436
Get back to me when you
open a savings account.

07:29.899 --> 07:31.999
Hey, look, man, um...

07:32.035 --> 07:34.552
just for future reference,
pizza place?

07:34.587 --> 07:36.529
Not really the best place
to pop the question.

07:42.913 --> 07:45.421
CRAIG: Kira!

07:45.457 --> 07:47.282
KIRA: What?!

07:47.317 --> 07:49.050
CRAIG: Have you seen
my brown coat?

07:49.086 --> 07:50.852
( Mouthing )

07:50.887 --> 07:52.328
KIRA: What brown coat?

07:52.363 --> 07:54.622
CRAIG: My brown spy coat.

07:54.658 --> 07:57.125
The one with the built-in
laser doohickey.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.701
KIRA: It's in with
your spy gear.

07:58.736 --> 08:00.095
CRAIG: I'm looking
in my spy gear!

08:00.130 --> 08:02.397
I don't see it!

08:02.399 --> 08:05.841
KIRA: Well, did you look
on your stationary bike,

08:05.877 --> 08:10.371
or as I like to call it,
"the pants tree"?

08:10.407 --> 08:12.473
CRAIG: ( laughs sarcastically )
It's not there.

08:12.509 --> 08:14.259
KIRA: That coat better not
be lost, Craig.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.244
It's a two-million-dollar
gadget.

08:16.279 --> 08:18.179
Two-million-dollars?!

08:18.214 --> 08:21.074
Hey, son! Where you going?

08:21.109 --> 08:22.884
Uh... school.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.660
It's 6:00.

08:24.696 --> 08:25.870
Never too late to learn.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.062
Kira!

08:34.097 --> 08:35.988
KIRA: What?

08:36.024 --> 08:38.883
I love you, baby.

08:38.918 --> 08:39.759
Yeah, I'm still not helping
you find that coat, Craig.

08:39.794 --> 08:40.794
Oh!

08:45.383 --> 08:47.717
I cannot sell you these jeans,
Mrs. Crowmise.

08:47.752 --> 08:49.377
They are a crime against fashion

08:49.412 --> 08:50.732
and I will not be
your accomplice!

08:52.616 --> 08:56.184
You shouldn't talk to your
math teacher like that!

08:56.219 --> 08:57.352
Oh, it's okay, we're close.

08:57.387 --> 08:58.667
I've had her two years in a row.

08:59.840 --> 09:00.840
So far.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.934
Anyway, remember the brown coat
I donated?

09:04.969 --> 09:09.263
I need it back. That coat is a
two-million-dollar spy gadget.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.592
Seriously? Your dad owns
a two-million-dollar coat?

09:12.669 --> 09:15.386
And he keeps a drawer full
of old soy sauce packets?

09:15.421 --> 09:17.664
- Where is it?
- I'm so sorry.

09:17.699 --> 09:19.674
I sold it
to some guy this morning.

09:19.709 --> 09:22.068
Okay, I'm gonna need
your security tapes.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.203
Entrances, exits, any
surveillance you might have.

09:24.238 --> 09:26.581
Ernie, this is a pop-up sale.

09:26.616 --> 09:28.717
The only surveillance we have
is Mrs. Eaton,

09:28.752 --> 09:30.310
who keeps browsing
and never buys!

09:35.750 --> 09:38.275
Well, at least tell me
what the guy looked like.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.453
( Scoffs ) I don't know.

09:40.530 --> 09:42.847
He was... He was round,
he was wearing a red shirt.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.557
And, like, eating
something sweet.

09:44.592 --> 09:47.435
You just described
Winnie the Pooh.

09:47.470 --> 09:51.247
No... I don't think
that was him.

09:56.813 --> 09:57.654
KC: I'm telling you, it's
the only way to find the mole.

09:57.689 --> 10:01.132
If you wanna know how evil
thinks, you gotta talk to evil.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.618
Fine, I guess we have no choice.

10:03.653 --> 10:05.886
To get inside, you're gonna need
the access code.

10:05.922 --> 10:10.399
( Clears throat ) 11B4J27QR9TT.

10:10.435 --> 10:11.435
( Stammers )

10:13.772 --> 10:16.706
Dang, if you were that hungry
I would've given you

10:16.742 --> 10:18.983
some peanut butter crackers
from my backpack.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.902
KC, it's too important
to have a paper trail.

10:21.938 --> 10:23.371
You need to memorize it.

10:23.407 --> 10:27.767
11B4J27QR9TT.

10:27.802 --> 10:30.178
Okay. Yeah, no. I got it.

10:30.213 --> 10:34.632
Good, because it's far too
sensitive to keep repeating it.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.137
You need me to say it again,
don't you?

10:36.161 --> 10:38.069
( Scoffs ) No.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.988
I am a professional
international spy.

10:41.023 --> 10:41.956
All right. I think
I can handle a code.

10:41.991 --> 10:43.341
Okay, then what's the code?

10:45.962 --> 10:47.962
- I know it starts with a one.
- ( groans )

10:47.998 --> 10:51.507
No, no, I'm kidding. Kidding, all right?
I got this.

10:51.542 --> 10:54.418
( Keypad beeps )

10:54.454 --> 10:58.106
- 9TS?
- GT! 9GT!

11:05.449 --> 11:06.449
Hello, Zane.

11:16.393 --> 11:18.100
Long time, no see.

11:18.136 --> 11:21.187
Bernice, I'm glad
they let you visit me.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.823
How's life?

11:23.858 --> 11:25.461
Must not be easy
being stuck with KC's face.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.844
I am KC.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.014
Oh, yes. I see that now.

11:32.049 --> 11:34.267
Still, must not be easy
being stuck with your face.

11:36.971 --> 11:40.039
What brings you all the way down here?
Let me guess.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.625
You came to ask my permission
for Brett's hand in marriage?

11:42.661 --> 11:44.518
( Chuckles ) You're so
old-fashioned.

11:44.554 --> 11:46.804
( Sarcastic chuckle )
You're so delusional.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.656
Look, I came here
'cause I need information.

11:48.692 --> 11:51.042
And I need a bathroom
with a door.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.952
I guess we're both out of luck.

11:52.987 --> 11:56.005
No, what you need
is a better attitude,

11:56.040 --> 11:59.133
Mr. Stuck-in-the-poke-and-
never-seen-the-light-of-day-the-rest-of-your-life.

11:59.169 --> 12:01.430
Fine. I would be happy to give
you the information you require,

12:01.454 --> 12:05.256
Miss Disappointingly-average-
teenage-spy-gotta-ask-her-family-nemesis-for-help.

12:08.069 --> 12:10.945
- Provided you give me something.
- Sure. What is it?

12:10.980 --> 12:13.372
Paint supplies, so I can paint
myself something to look at.

12:13.408 --> 12:15.983
( Scoffs ) Really?

12:16.019 --> 12:17.146
I would have given you anything
and that's what you choose?

12:17.170 --> 12:18.397
- And my freedom.
- No, no, no. Too late.

12:18.421 --> 12:20.988
You already chose paints.

12:21.024 --> 12:25.827
Now, look. Someone is stealing
information from the Organization,

12:25.862 --> 12:27.047
and I need to know
how you would do it.

12:27.071 --> 12:30.656
Perhaps...
it's not being stolen.

12:30.691 --> 12:33.267
Perhaps you shared it
with the wrong person.

12:33.303 --> 12:35.272
What are you talking about? No
one even knows that I'm a spy.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.696
What about your blonde friend?

12:37.732 --> 12:39.418
The one who talks faster
than she can think.

12:39.442 --> 12:41.600
Marissa? No. No.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.045
All of my secrets
are safe with her.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.760
I mean, she never told anyone that
I practiced kissing on my pillow.

12:46.841 --> 12:49.359
You didn't hear that.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.953
Think about it, KC.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.656
It's always the people
that we trust the most.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.865
Husbands betray wives.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.952
Children lie to their parents.

12:59.988 --> 13:03.740
Friends spread rumors
behind each other's backs.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.942
Maybe Marissa is selling
your secrets for profit.

13:11.282 --> 13:12.282
( Inaudible dialogue )

13:23.537 --> 13:25.920
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, how are you?

13:25.955 --> 13:28.475
( Chuckles ) Marissa, can I talk
to you in private for a second?

13:30.393 --> 13:32.618
KC, what are you doing here?

13:32.653 --> 13:34.595
Zane was right,
I can't trust you.

13:34.630 --> 13:36.575
Who is that guy and are you
selling him my secrets?

13:36.599 --> 13:39.675
- He is my date.
- Your date?

13:39.710 --> 13:41.444
Oh, so all of a sudden you have a boyfriend
that you never even told me about?

13:41.446 --> 13:44.405
I didn't tell you because
he's a freshman in college

13:44.441 --> 13:47.675
and I knew you'd give me a hard time
'cause I'm still in high school.

13:47.710 --> 13:49.552
No, Sean, Sean, Sean.
Don't leave.

13:49.587 --> 13:51.437
I'm only technically
in high school

13:51.472 --> 13:53.689
and I'm barely ever there!

13:53.724 --> 13:55.407
Thanks a lot, KC.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.735
Why are you spying on me?

13:57.770 --> 14:00.362
There's a mole
in the Organization

14:00.398 --> 14:04.417
and sometimes I tell you
highly classified information.

14:04.452 --> 14:07.128
You actually thought that
I was selling your secrets?

14:07.163 --> 14:09.323
For your information, when
you're telling me spy stuff,

14:09.349 --> 14:12.032
most of the time I'm just
standing there quietly

14:12.068 --> 14:14.988
waiting for you to stop talking so I
can start talking about myself again.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.246
I can't believe you.

14:17.281 --> 14:19.832
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry, okay?

14:19.867 --> 14:21.620
It was wrong, I should've
never suspected you.

14:21.644 --> 14:24.011
But I am not sorry
for ruining your date,

14:24.047 --> 14:27.139
because that guy's too old
for you. I do not approve.

14:27.174 --> 14:29.728
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna have
a little chitchat with a criminal.

14:29.752 --> 14:32.403
Oh, so I can't date someone
a tiny bit older than me,

14:32.438 --> 14:34.863
but you can go hang out
with criminals?

14:34.899 --> 14:36.657
That is a double standard,
missy.

14:36.693 --> 14:39.043
Hey, at least I have standards.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.536
Well, she got me there.

14:45.944 --> 14:49.061
Ah, KC, what do you
think of my painting?

14:49.097 --> 14:50.846
Well, it's a pretty good alien.

14:50.882 --> 14:52.881
It's a kitten.

14:52.917 --> 14:54.725
In that case, it stinks.

14:54.761 --> 14:59.805
You lied to me. Marissa isn't the mole.
I'm taking the paints back.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.710
I didn't lie to you. I was
simply illustrating a point.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.414
Well, you illustrate points about
as well as you illustrate kittens.

15:06.481 --> 15:08.464
Now I need information.
How do I find the mole?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.132
( Clicks tongue )

15:10.168 --> 15:12.560
Poor KC.

15:12.595 --> 15:15.505
She's not asking
the right question.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.856
I meant what I said.

15:17.892 --> 15:21.002
It's always the ones closest
to us that hurt us the most.

15:21.037 --> 15:24.372
So ask yourself, KC,
who's closest to you?

15:24.407 --> 15:26.582
I don't know.

15:26.618 --> 15:28.326
Yes, you do. Think, KC.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.253
Who do you see every day?

15:30.288 --> 15:31.537
I don't know.

15:31.572 --> 15:33.339
Who knows your every move?

15:33.374 --> 15:35.283
I don't know!

15:35.318 --> 15:37.101
Who knows you better
than you know yourself?

15:37.178 --> 15:40.546
Who knows you so well
that you'd never suspect them?

15:40.582 --> 15:42.831
Even though they're
right under your nose.

15:42.866 --> 15:45.251
My family! Okay? My family!

15:45.286 --> 15:47.005
I said it, but why
would someone in my family

15:47.029 --> 15:48.529
want to sell me out?

15:48.565 --> 15:51.190
Well now...

15:51.225 --> 15:53.225
you're finally starting
to ask the right questions.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.606
KC, you okay, honey?

16:06.641 --> 16:09.325
You've hardly said a word
since you got home.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.120
Yeah. I'm sure you'd love it if I
just spilled all my secrets to you.

16:13.156 --> 16:16.090
Yes, I would. I mean, I like our
mother-daughter talks.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.987
In fact, I like talking
to everyone in this family.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.760
CRAIG: Kira!

16:19.796 --> 16:21.137
What do you want from me now?!

16:25.076 --> 16:27.701
I searched this house from top to
bottom, somebody took my coat!

16:27.737 --> 16:29.762
Coat? Is there a coat missing?

16:29.797 --> 16:31.105
( Nervous chuckle )
That's weird.

16:35.053 --> 16:37.929
Craig, nobody took your coat.
Obviously, you lost it.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.398
I didn't lose it.
The only thing I've ever lost

16:40.433 --> 16:43.710
was my place in line for those New
Edition reunion tour concert ticket.

16:43.786 --> 16:45.180
'Cause somebody didn't
feel like standing anymore.

16:45.204 --> 16:48.789
My water broke, Craig.

16:48.824 --> 16:52.593
You know, if you didn't
lose the coat, where is it?

16:52.670 --> 16:53.814
I mean, it's not like it
just up and disappeared.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.113
Maybe it did!

16:56.149 --> 16:57.648
It is a spy jacket!

16:57.683 --> 16:59.934
You're right, Craig.

16:59.969 --> 17:03.153
And maybe it went on vacation.

17:03.189 --> 17:07.558
Maybe it booked a flight
to Aruba for some R&R!

17:07.593 --> 17:10.161
Ohh! And we were fourth in line
when your water broke.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.756
If you could've waited ten more
minutes, I'd have had my tickets!

17:15.926 --> 17:17.818
Why are you staring at me?

17:17.854 --> 17:21.188
Because you're sweating.

17:21.224 --> 17:22.910
- What do you have to hide?
- I didn't do anything!

17:22.934 --> 17:25.034
Oh, really? Then why do you
look so guilty?

17:26.662 --> 17:28.178
All right, I admit it!

17:28.214 --> 17:29.697
I knew it!
My own brother, the mole.

17:29.732 --> 17:31.841
Mole?!

17:31.876 --> 17:35.077
I'm no mole. I took Dad's coat.

17:35.113 --> 17:38.105
I gave it to Marissa for
a stupid charity pop-up sale.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.049
Wait, so you're not the mole?

17:40.084 --> 17:42.893
No. I'm a two-million-dollar
coat stealer.

17:42.928 --> 17:44.979
And I have no idea where it is.

17:45.056 --> 17:46.917
You do know that coat has
a tracking device, right?

17:46.941 --> 17:50.902
What? I had no idea.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.456
Yeah, good luck with that,
computer guy.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.923
( Door slams )

17:55.958 --> 17:58.725
CRAIG: Kira, I got my hand stuck
in the toilet.

17:58.761 --> 18:01.195
KIRA: What the heck was your
hand doing in the toilet?

18:01.230 --> 18:02.699
CRAIG: I already looked
everywhere else.

18:02.723 --> 18:07.034
What was I thinking? Of course none of
these chuckleheads could be the mole.

18:16.904 --> 18:20.297
( Gasps ) Winnie the Pooh!

18:22.502 --> 18:23.676
Thanks, tracking device.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.103
Those cannolis,
best in the city.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.015
Thank you, thank you.

19:03.050 --> 19:04.542
And for my next trick,

19:04.577 --> 19:06.135
I will make this jacket
disappear.

19:13.603 --> 19:16.637
CRAIG: I'm telling you
the coat wasn't there before.

19:16.673 --> 19:19.415
KIRA: Oh, so it just magically
appeared in your closet?

19:19.450 --> 19:21.942
CRAIG: No, I bet you put it
there to make me look stupid.

19:21.977 --> 19:24.103
KIRA: Craig, you do not need
my help to look stupid.

19:24.138 --> 19:25.946
You do that all on your own,
baby.

19:33.455 --> 19:35.681
KC: Hey, Brett. A kiss?

19:35.716 --> 19:37.750
I don't see why not.

19:40.705 --> 19:46.359
11B4J27QR9TT.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.761
You're a liar, Zane!

19:48.796 --> 19:53.740
11B4J27QR9TT.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.475
You'll never get out of here!

19:55.511 --> 19:59.797
- 11B4Q...
- KC. KC.

19:59.832 --> 20:00.893
You're talking in your sleep.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.925
What was I saying?

20:02.960 --> 20:04.601
You kept talking about Zane

20:04.637 --> 20:05.906
and then saying a bunch
of nonsense numbers.

20:05.930 --> 20:08.122
What numbers was I saying?

20:08.157 --> 20:10.883
I don't know. 11B4-something.

20:10.918 --> 20:14.061
The code!

20:14.096 --> 20:16.247
It's in here!
It's gotta be in here.

20:18.141 --> 20:20.426
Uh, hate to break it to you,

20:20.503 --> 20:22.595
but you made more sense
when you were sleep talking.

20:22.672 --> 20:25.239
( Groans ) They're bugging me.
They're bugging me!

20:25.274 --> 20:27.633
Yes, and you're
starting to bug me.

20:27.668 --> 20:30.511
Ah! I got it.

20:32.715 --> 20:34.740
Ooh!

20:34.775 --> 20:36.600
Ow! Whoo!

20:36.635 --> 20:37.635
Ow.

20:40.355 --> 20:42.923
Well, I found the mole.

20:42.958 --> 20:45.242
Excellent, I can't wait to get
a hold of that slimeball.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.328
I'll make him wish
he'd never been born.

20:47.363 --> 20:49.939
Or, we could forgive and forget.

20:49.974 --> 20:52.224
What are you talking about?

20:52.259 --> 20:54.418
Well, technically,
the mole is me.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.504
You?

20:56.539 --> 20:59.164
Yeah, um, I've been
talking in my sleep.

20:59.199 --> 21:00.552
Remember that code
that you ate for lunch?

21:00.576 --> 21:02.567
Oh, yeah. ( Grunts )

21:02.603 --> 21:05.871
Well, let's just say I've been practically
singing that code in my sleep.

21:05.906 --> 21:08.199
So whoever bugged my room,

21:08.234 --> 21:09.878
will have that tune stuck in
their head for quite a while.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.071
Wait, if the code
has been leaked,

21:11.095 --> 21:12.095
that means...

21:14.857 --> 21:16.265
Oh, move!

21:19.653 --> 21:21.128
No, no, no!

21:21.163 --> 21:23.147
How could this have happened?

21:24.792 --> 21:27.234
Hey, look at this.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.315
"Hello, KC.
If you're reading this,"

21:33.350 --> 21:35.142
then I have successfully
escaped.

21:35.177 --> 21:37.611
That, or I tried to escape
and you caught me

21:37.647 --> 21:41.115
and now you're reading this back
to me just to tease me.

21:41.150 --> 21:43.726
I'd like to thank you, KC.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.545
Without your help, I never would
have been able to leave this place.

21:46.581 --> 21:48.538
Thanks to your stay in my barn,

21:48.574 --> 21:51.249
"I learned that when you're
stressed you sleep talk."

21:51.285 --> 21:52.851
ZANE: <i>"Thanks to the bug
I planted,</i>

21:52.886 --> 21:54.219
<i>it was only a matter of time</i>

21:54.254 --> 21:56.288
<i>before you let
the access code slip</i>

21:56.323 --> 21:58.666
<i>and one of my people
came to bust me out.</i>

21:58.701 --> 22:01.476
<i>Oh, and thanks
for the paint supplies.</i>

22:01.511 --> 22:02.939
<i>It's amazing
what you can accomplish</i>

22:02.963 --> 22:05.289
<i>with a nice, sharp brush</i>

22:05.324 --> 22:07.174
<i>and a dull guard.</i>

22:07.209 --> 22:10.827
<i>I guess this is farewell.</i>

22:10.863 --> 22:13.489
<i>"But don't be sad, I'm sure
we'll see each other soon."</i>

22:18.513 --> 22:20.112
Zane's out there.

22:20.147 --> 22:22.422
He hates my family
more than ever,

22:22.457 --> 22:23.791
and it's all my fault.

22:30.499 --> 22:32.933
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
