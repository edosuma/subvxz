WEBVTT

00:14.362 --> 00:16.407
UH, HON, YOU OK?

00:16.451 --> 00:18.366
THIS MOTION SENSOR
ALERT ON MY WATCH,

00:18.409 --> 00:20.672
IT KEEPS GOING OFF.
OHH...

00:20.716 --> 00:23.240
TURN THOSE NOTIFICATIONS
OFF, WOULD YOU?

00:23.284 --> 00:25.677
WHAT IF SOMEBODY'’S
OUTSIDE?

00:25.721 --> 00:29.246
IT'’S THE CAT.
IT'’S ALWAYS THE CAT.

00:29.290 --> 00:32.423
I DON'’T UNDERSTAND
HOW IT'’S NOT THE DAMN CAT.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.425
OHH, IT'’S 3:30
IN THE MORNING.

00:36.297 --> 00:39.256
THAT'’S NOT THE CAT.
CALL 911.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.606
WAIT, TIM. LET'’S CHECK.

00:41.650 --> 00:45.306
MAN: COME ON!
PLEASE LET ME IN!

00:45.349 --> 00:47.525
PLEASE LET ME IN!
PLEASE...

00:47.569 --> 00:49.266
MAN ON PHONE:
HNA SECURITY. HOW CAN WE HELP?

00:49.310 --> 00:51.138
WE HAVE A--
I DON'’T KNOW--

00:51.181 --> 00:53.314
SOME CRAZY MAN
BANGING ON OUR DOOR.

00:53.357 --> 00:54.663
MAN ON PHONE: OK.
WE HAVE AN OFFICER

00:54.706 --> 00:55.838
ON THE WAY
TO YOUR ADDRESS.

00:55.881 --> 00:56.578
THIS LOOKS LIKE
HE'’S IN TROUBLE,

00:56.621 --> 00:57.535
LIKE, REAL TROUBLE.

00:57.579 --> 00:58.449
MAYBE WE SHOULD
TRY TO HELP HIM.

00:58.493 --> 00:59.711
NO.
MAN ON PHONE: NO.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.539
FOR YOUR SAFETY,
DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR

01:01.583 --> 01:03.585
OR ENGAGE WITH THIS MAN.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.804
OH, MY GOD, TIM.
SOMEBODY IS AFTER HIM.

01:05.848 --> 01:06.805
WE HAVE TO--

01:06.849 --> 01:08.764
WE ARE NOT
OPENING THE DOOR.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.722
MAN: HE'’S COMING!
PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR!

01:10.766 --> 01:13.247
PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR!
HE'’S GONNA KILL US!

01:13.290 --> 01:20.123
PLEASE SAVE US!

01:20.167 --> 01:22.778
ALVEZ: I'’M TELLING
YOU, I DON'’T WANT
A HOUSEWARMING PARTY.

01:22.821 --> 01:24.258
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?

01:24.301 --> 01:27.261
WHO DOESN'’T LIKE
RIBBON-ADORNED

01:27.304 --> 01:29.132
POTTED PLANTS
AND VEGGIE CRUDITEÉ

01:29.176 --> 01:30.960
AND HUMMUS WITH
YOUR FACE CARVED IN IT?

01:31.003 --> 01:33.441
DO YOU EVEN
FONDUE, BRO?

01:33.484 --> 01:35.965
WE'’VE GOT BIGGER
FISH TO FRY HERE.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.141
IT'’S LIFE AND DEATH,

01:38.185 --> 01:40.404
AND A HOUSEWARMING PARTY
JUST SEEMS STUPID.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.014
LEWIS: OOH, WHO'’S THROWING
A HOUSEWARMING PARTY?

01:42.058 --> 01:43.712
OH, PLEASE SAY IT'’S YOU.

01:43.755 --> 01:46.323
I'’M DYING
FOR SOME FRIVOLITY, JOY,
AND SOME OVERPRICED SNACKS.

01:46.367 --> 01:50.675
NOT ME, OK?
LISA WANTS ONE.

01:50.719 --> 01:51.850
SHE WANTS TO GET TO KNOW

01:51.894 --> 01:53.330
ALL OF YOU GUYS
A LITTLE BETTER.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.376
IN FACT, YOU'’RE THE
ONLY ONES INVITED.

01:55.419 --> 01:58.596
I THINK SOMEONE IS
AFRAID OF FORMAL GESTURES

01:58.640 --> 02:01.033
THAT MIGHT INSINUATE
A COMMITMENT.

02:01.077 --> 02:04.036
ALVEZ: OH, IS THAT
NOT THE KETEL ONE

02:04.080 --> 02:05.647
CALLING
THE POT BLACK?

02:05.690 --> 02:08.345
HEY, I'’M A REFORMED KETTLE,
AND WHAT IS IT THEY SAY?

02:08.389 --> 02:11.043
THE FOURTH TIME'’S
THE CHARM.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.828
JJ: WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS TALKING ABOUT?

02:12.871 --> 02:14.395
LEWIS: OH, HEY, LUKE'’S
THROWING A HOUSEWARMING PARTY.

02:14.438 --> 02:17.049
NO. I'’M NOT HAVING
A HOUSEWARMING PARTY.

02:17.093 --> 02:19.356
JJ: WHAT? I LOVE A GOOD
HOUSEWARMING PARTY.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.054
MATT, HELP ME OUT, PLEASE.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.622
UH, WHAT DOES
LISA WANT?

02:27.234 --> 02:28.887
LISA WANTS
A PARTY.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.628
YEAH. YOU'’RE THROWING
THE PARTY, DUDE.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.413
MM-HMM.
OH...

02:32.456 --> 02:33.196
PRENTISS: LET'’S MEET
IN THE ROUND TABLE.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.806
WE HAVE A CASE.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.808
LISA PUT YOU UP
TO THIS, DIDN'’T SHE?

02:36.852 --> 02:39.028
MM! MM!

02:39.071 --> 02:41.073
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.554
HE'’S COMING! HE'S COMING!
PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR!

02:43.598 --> 02:45.687
PLEASE HELP US!
HE'’S GONNA KILL US!

02:45.730 --> 02:48.255
PLEASE SAVE US!

02:48.298 --> 02:49.473
PORTLAND, OREGON, PD
NEEDS OUR HELP

02:49.517 --> 02:50.909
LOCATING THIS MAN.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.781
THEY BELIEVE THE ABDUCTION
MIGHT BE CONNECTED

02:52.824 --> 02:54.348
TO A LOCAL COUPLE
WHO WERE KILLED

02:54.391 --> 02:56.001
IN THEIR HOME LAST WEEK.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.873
THAT FIRST COUPLE
WAS FOUND BOUND

02:57.916 --> 02:59.831
WITH DUCT TAPE ON
THEIR HEADS, NECKS,

02:59.875 --> 03:01.442
WRISTS, AND HANDS.

03:01.485 --> 03:04.227
BOTH CRIMES INVOLVE DUCT TAPE,
AND DUCT TAPE IS PRETTY COMMON.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.534
YEAH, BUT ABDUCTING
COUPLES ISN'’T.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.536
I MEAN, "SAVE US.
HELP US"?

03:08.579 --> 03:10.886
THERE'’S DEFINITELY
ANOTHER ABDUCTEE

03:10.929 --> 03:12.409
ASSOCIATED WITH
THIS SECOND VICTIM.

03:12.453 --> 03:13.715
SIMMONS:
WELL, THIS GUY IS BAREFOOT

03:13.758 --> 03:15.238
AND WEARING BOXER SHORTS,

03:15.282 --> 03:16.544
SO EITHER THE UNSUB
SURPRISED THEM IN BED

03:16.587 --> 03:18.328
OR THIS COULD BE
A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER GONE WRONG.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.069
ROSSI: IF THIS STARTS
AS CONSENSUAL,

03:20.112 --> 03:21.592
IT CERTAINLY
DOESN'’T STAY THAT WAY.

03:21.636 --> 03:22.941
THIS GUY FIGHTS
FOR HIS FREEDOM,

03:22.985 --> 03:24.247
FLED FOR HIS LIFE
INSTEAD OF GOING BACK

03:24.291 --> 03:25.640
FOR HIS PARTNER.

03:25.683 --> 03:28.120
MUST BE SOME SADISTIC GAMES
THIS UNSUB'’S PLAYING.

03:28.164 --> 03:30.688
OK. I HATE TO SAY IT,

03:30.732 --> 03:32.603
BUT THE OTHER VICTIM
COULD BE DEAD,

03:32.647 --> 03:34.605
OR MAYBE THEY SPLIT
UP, AND THIS GUY

03:34.649 --> 03:36.781
WAS LUCKY ENOUGH
TO GET ON CAMERA.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.783
DID THEY USE
FACIAL RECOGNITION
TO I.D. THE VICTIM?

03:38.827 --> 03:40.655
GARCIA: YEAH, BUT
NOTHING'’S COME UP YET.

03:40.698 --> 03:41.786
SO WE HAVE
TWO CONFIRMED MURDERS

03:41.830 --> 03:43.179
AND TWO MORE
POTENTIAL ONES.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.833
WE'’RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE
FAST TO STOP HIM.

03:44.876 --> 03:47.314
FORTUNATELY, WE WILL HAVE
REINFORCEMENTS ON THIS CASE.

03:47.357 --> 03:48.880
WHEELS UP.

03:48.924 --> 03:51.231
GARCIA: REINFORCEMENTS?
WHAT REINFORCEMENTS?
HIM.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.015
WAIT. YOU'’RE BACK?

03:53.058 --> 03:54.321
WHY ARE YOU BACK?
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:54.364 --> 03:55.713
NOTHING HAPPENED.

03:55.757 --> 03:56.975
THE SEMINAR WRAPPED EARLY,
AND I MISSED YOU GUYS.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.281
ROSSI: WELL, YOU'’RE JUST
IN TIME TO HELP US

03:58.325 --> 03:59.935
REEL IN A NASTY ONE.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.328
PRENTISS: WE'’LL BRIEF YOU ON
THE WAY TO THE JET. LET'’S GO.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.590
AND WE'’LL
CATCH UP LATER.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.809
GO, MIGHTY
PROFESSOR. GO!

04:11.076 --> 04:16.038
J.P., ARE YOU AWAKE?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

04:16.081 --> 04:18.040
YEAH.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.347
DID ANYONE SEE YOU?

04:20.390 --> 04:23.045
WHEN YOU
GOT OUT, DID ANYONE--

04:23.088 --> 04:25.265
PLEASE SAY YES.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.702
I--I DON'’T KNOW.

04:27.745 --> 04:30.618
I TRIED.
I TRIED, I SWEAR.

04:30.661 --> 04:33.490
HOW BAD DOES IT HURT?

04:33.534 --> 04:35.362
IT'’S BAD.

04:35.405 --> 04:40.236
OHH. I'’M REALLY SCARED.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.892
I AM, TOO.

04:43.935 --> 04:47.156
I LOVE YOU. I NEED
YOU TO KNOW THAT.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.201
IF WE DON'’T GET OUT OF HERE,
I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT, OK?

04:49.245 --> 04:51.247
DON'’T SAY THAT.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.597
OH, NO. WAIT.

04:53.641 --> 04:56.557
WAIT. IS THAT--
OH, GOD.

04:59.081 --> 05:03.041
DON'’T DO THIS. WAIT.
OH, WAIT. DON'’T--

05:03.085 --> 05:05.392
J.P.: NOT AGAIN.
NOT AGAIN.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.742
NO, NO, NO.
NOT AGAIN.

05:07.785 --> 05:10.397
NIK, NIK, LOOK AT ME.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.876
NO. THIS ISN'’T FAIR.
WE DIDN'’T DO ANYTHING.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.138
NIK, LOOK AT ME,
PLEASE!

05:13.182 --> 05:14.575
NIK, LOOK AT ME.

05:14.618 --> 05:17.926
YOU'’RE THE LAST THING
THAT I WANT TO SEE, OK,

05:17.969 --> 05:21.712
YOU'’RE THE LAST THING
THAT I WANT TO SEE.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.627
NO. THIS ISN'’T FAIR.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.281
DON'’T DO THIS.
JUST DON'’T DO THIS.
DON'’T. PLEASE.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.283
DON'’T DO THIS.

05:29.633 --> 05:33.463
STOP!
AAH! AAH...

06:10.195 --> 06:12.850
J.J., VOICE-OVER:
"REVENGE, THE SWEETEST MORSEL

06:12.894 --> 06:16.201
TO THE MOUTH THAT
EVER WAS COOKED IN HELL."

06:16.245 --> 06:18.029
SIR WALTER SCOTT.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.205
STILL NO I.D. ON THE MAN
IN THE VIDEO

06:20.249 --> 06:22.120
OR ANY OTHER POTENTIAL
VICTIMS,

06:22.164 --> 06:24.209
SO WE SHOULD START
BY LOOKING AT THE FILES

06:24.253 --> 06:26.821
ON OUR MURDERED COUPLE
FROM A WEEK AGO.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.605
WE NEED TO CONFIRM
A CONNECTION.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.041
GARCIA, ON VIDEO CONFERENCE:
ON YOUR TABLETS, YOU'’LL SEE

06:30.085 --> 06:33.088
WILLIAM AND SARAH MENDELBAUM
OF PERRI PARK.

06:33.131 --> 06:36.396
WILLIAM WAS A BELOVED
DOCTOR IN THE COMMUNITY.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.962
HE RETIRED 3 YEARS AGO.

06:38.006 --> 06:41.488
AND SARAH VOLUNTEERED AT
A LOCAL BIRD SANCTUARY.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.577
BOTH OF THEM WERE
IN THEIR EARLY 60s.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.796
DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT
PHYSICAL VICTIMOLOGY

06:45.840 --> 06:47.798
THAN THE GUY
WE SAW LAST NIGHT,

06:47.842 --> 06:49.409
WHO WAS--
I DON'’T KNOW--

06:49.452 --> 06:51.323
IN HIS LATE 20s,
EARLY 30s.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.195
THE DUCT TAPE
TELLS THE TALE.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.197
THE FIRST COUPLE WAS
BOUND AROUND THE WRIST,

06:55.240 --> 06:56.720
ANKLES, AND NECK.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.548
SO WAS OUR GUY
IN THE VIDEO.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.245
THIS HAD GOT TO BE
THE SAME UNSUB.

07:00.289 --> 07:01.682
SIMMONS:
THE M.E. DETERMINED
THE WEAPON TO BE

07:01.725 --> 07:02.987
SOME KIND OF
A HUNTING KNIFE.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.076
ON THE MENDELBAUMS,
WE HAVE 5 STAB WOUNDS

07:05.120 --> 07:08.253
ON EACH--3 ON THE TORSO
AND TWO ON THEIR NECKS.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.559
LEWIS: THEIR EYEBROWS
WERE SINGED,

07:09.603 --> 07:10.995
THEIR EYELASHES
COMPLETELY BURNED OFF.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.084
THE TIPS OF THEIR EYEBALLS
WERE SEVERELY BURNED,

07:13.128 --> 07:14.912
AND THE SKIN AROUND THEIR EYES
SUSTAINED SECOND-DEGREE BURNS

07:14.956 --> 07:16.392
ANTEMORTEM.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.741
WHATEVER IT WAS
THAT BURNED THEM

07:17.785 --> 07:19.439
COULDN'’T BE FOUND
AT THE SCENE.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.744
YEAH. MUST BE

07:20.788 --> 07:22.398
FROM SOME KIND OF
LOCALIZED HEAT SOURCE,

07:22.442 --> 07:24.444
MAYBE A LIGHTER
OR BUTANE TORCH,

07:24.487 --> 07:27.925
SOMETHING SO FINITE
AND PRECISE THAT HE

07:27.969 --> 07:31.581
DIDN'’T MELT THE EYEBALLS
OR DESTROY THE EYE SOCKETS.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.105
REID: GARCIA, CAN YOU SHOW US
THE VIDEO FROM LAST NIGHT?

07:34.149 --> 07:36.630
UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN.

07:36.673 --> 07:40.111
HELP! HELP!
PLEASE LET ME IN!

07:40.155 --> 07:42.287
PAUSE IT
RIGHT THERE.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.333
HIS LEFT CORNEA.
YOU GUYS SEE THAT?

07:44.376 --> 07:46.291
EASILY WRITTEN OFF
AS REFLECTOR GLOW

07:46.335 --> 07:47.771
FROM LOW-LIGHT
VIDEO CONDITIONS,

07:47.815 --> 07:49.556
BUT I THINK
THE UNSUB BURNED IT,

07:49.599 --> 07:50.731
AND THE SKIN
AROUND THE AREA

07:50.774 --> 07:51.862
ISN'’T AFFECTED LIKE
ON THE MENDELBAUMS.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.385
HE'’S GETTING
BETTER AT THIS.

07:53.429 --> 07:55.126
PRENTISS: EXCEPT HE LOST CONTROL
OF HIS VICTIM LAST NIGHT,

07:55.170 --> 07:56.519
SO HE'’S NOT THAT GOOD.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.086
WHEN WE LAND,
SPENCER, J.J., MATT,

07:58.129 --> 07:59.609
GO TO THE MENDELBAUM
CRIME SCENE.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.350
THE REST OF US WILL SET UP
AT THE LOCAL PD.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.221
LET'’S HOPE WE FIND
THIS UNSUB

08:03.265 --> 08:05.180
BEFORE HE PERFECTS
HIS TECHNIQUE.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.532
LEWIS: SO THE FIRST VICTIMS,
THE MENDELBAUMS,

08:09.576 --> 08:11.186
THEY LIVED UP HERE
IN THE WEST,

08:11.229 --> 08:13.710
AND THEN THE ALDRIDGE HOUSE,
WHERE THE SECOND VICTIM

08:13.754 --> 08:16.278
RANG THE DOORBELL
WAS DOWN HERE IN THE SOUTH,

08:16.321 --> 08:18.280
SO WHAT ARE THESE
TWO NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE?

08:18.323 --> 08:19.890
BOTH QUIET.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.849
THE SOUTH PART IS
ADJACENT TO DOWNTOWN,

08:21.892 --> 08:23.590
AND THE WEST PART
IS MORE WELL-TO-DO

08:23.633 --> 08:25.069
AND SECLUDED
IN THE HILLS.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.941
BUT THE BLOOD TRAIL
FOUND AT THE ALDRIDGES'’

08:26.984 --> 08:28.551
WENT FROM THE PORCH
TO THE CURB,

08:28.595 --> 08:31.075
SO OUR UNSUB HAD
A WAITING VEHICLE,

08:31.119 --> 08:33.164
BUT WHICH DIRECTION DID
OUR VICTIM COME FROM?

08:33.208 --> 08:35.253
WELL, OUR GUY HAD MUD
ON HIS FEET.

08:35.297 --> 08:38.300
HOW HE GOT THAT WOULD
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, EMILY.

08:38.343 --> 08:40.215
POLICE CHIEF: THE WEST
PART IS RIGHT AT THE EDGE

08:40.258 --> 08:42.086
OF A HUGE
WOODED FOREST.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.914
ALL RIGHT. SO THAT MEANS
OUR VICTIM WOULD HAVE HAD

08:43.958 --> 08:46.090
TO HAVE APPROACHED
THROUGH HERE

08:46.134 --> 08:48.049
FROM THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
I'’M ASSUMING. ROXY HEIGHTS?

08:48.092 --> 08:49.441
THAT WOULD TRACK.

08:49.485 --> 08:51.443
WAIT. IF HE WOULD'’VE
JUST MADE A RIGHT

08:51.487 --> 08:53.097
WHEN HE CAME OUT
OF THE CUL-DE-SAC,

08:53.141 --> 08:55.578
HE WOULD'’VE RUN SMACK DAB
INTO A POLICE SUBSTATION.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.101
HE WOULD'’VE BEEN SAVED.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.060
PRENTISS: MAYBE HE
DIDN'’T KNOW THE AREA.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.757
POLICE CHIEF: IT'’S NOT
LIKE WE KEPT IT A SECRET.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.716
WE DO ALL KINDS
OF NEIGHBORHOOD OUTREACH.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.761
NO. IT CHANGES
OUR PROFILE.

09:04.805 --> 09:07.721
HE PICKED A VICTIM OR,
MORE LIKELY, A COUPLE

09:07.764 --> 09:09.026
THAT ISN'’T LOCAL.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.550
IF THEY'’RE HARD TO FIND,
HE'’S HARD TO FIND.

09:10.593 --> 09:13.030
SO WAS THAT ON PURPOSE,
OR DID HE JUST GET LUCKY?

09:13.074 --> 09:15.467
MAYBE THE MENDELBAUM
CRIME SCENE

09:15.511 --> 09:18.079
WILL HELP US
FIGURE THAT OUT.

09:18.122 --> 09:21.735
J.J.: THANK YOU FOR LETTING US
INTO YOUR PARENTS'’ HOME.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.258
ARE YOU GONNA CATCH
THE SON OF A BITCH

09:23.301 --> 09:25.086
THAT DID THIS TO THEM?

09:25.129 --> 09:28.437
WELL, WE WON'’T LEAVE
UNTIL WE DO.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.440
SO HOW LONG DID YOUR DAD
PRACTICE MEDICINE HERE?

09:31.483 --> 09:35.270
35 YEARS,
RETIRED FOR ONLY 3.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.272
IT'’S QUITE A LEGACY.

09:37.315 --> 09:40.318
CAN YOU THINK OF
ANYONE WHO WOULD WANT

09:40.362 --> 09:42.756
TO HURT HIM
OR YOUR MOM?

09:42.799 --> 09:45.454
NO. MY DAD WAS
A PEDIATRICIAN.

09:45.497 --> 09:49.763
EVERYONE LOVED HIM
AND MY MOM.

09:49.806 --> 09:54.637
I DON'’T GET IT.
WHY--

09:56.683 --> 09:58.336
WHY WHAT?

09:58.380 --> 10:01.035
WHEN MY PARENTS WOULDN'’T
ANSWER MY CALLS OR TEXTS,

10:01.078 --> 10:04.647
I CAME OVER
TO CHECK ON THEM, AND--

10:04.691 --> 10:07.476
YOU FOUND THE BODIES.

10:07.519 --> 10:11.349
YEAH, BUT
BEFORE I DID,

10:11.393 --> 10:13.787
THE WHOLE HOUSE
WAS DARK.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.789
I WAS STUMBLING AROUND,
TRYING TO FIND THEM,

10:15.832 --> 10:17.791
AND WHEN I GOT
TO THE FUSE BOX,

10:17.834 --> 10:19.662
ALL THE BREAKERS
WERE TRIPPED.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.665
SO THE KILLER TURNED OFF
ALL THE LIGHTS.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.362
THIS WASN'’T IN
THE POLICE REPORT.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.277
DID YOU TELL THEM?

10:26.321 --> 10:27.670
IS IT IMPORTANT?

10:27.714 --> 10:29.324
UH, IT MIGHT BE.

10:31.413 --> 10:34.546
UH, EXCUSE ME.

10:39.377 --> 10:43.077
SO WE RULED OUT
THE SON, RIGHT?

10:43.120 --> 10:44.948
YEAH. HE WAS HOME
ALL NIGHT. WHY?

10:44.992 --> 10:46.776
WELL, THE UNSUB CUT
THE POWER TO THE HOUSE,

10:46.820 --> 10:48.952
AND RAY DIDN'’T MENTION IT
TO THE POLICE.

10:48.996 --> 10:51.041
IT'’S ODD, BUT HE DID JUST
LOSE BOTH HIS PARENTS.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.695
AND THAT TRACKS
WITH WHAT WE FOUND.

10:52.739 --> 10:53.827
WELL, WHAT
DID YOU FIND?

10:53.870 --> 10:55.045
REID: WELL, THE UNSUB
SECURED THEM HERE

10:55.089 --> 10:56.438
AND NOT VERY WELL.

10:56.481 --> 10:57.569
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

10:57.613 --> 10:58.788
BUTANE BURNS
ON THE TABLE.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.485
THEY SQUIRMED AS HE
BROUGHT THE LIGHTER DOWN.

11:00.529 --> 11:04.402
OK. WELL, WHY BLIND HIM,
THEN STAB?

11:04.446 --> 11:06.578
HE HAS THEM SECURE.
IT'’S ALREADY DARK.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.319
WHAT IS HE TRYING
TO ACCOMPLISH?

11:08.363 --> 11:12.323
SIMMONS: THIS.
SO WE ASKED THE POLICE

11:12.367 --> 11:16.110
TO DUST FOR PRINTS, BUT WE
WERE NOT EXPECTING THIS.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.851
OH, MY GOD.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.462
THE PRINTS ALL BELONG TO
MR. AND MRS. MENDELBAUM.

11:20.505 --> 11:23.508
JJ: YEAH.
THEY WERE TRYING

11:23.552 --> 11:26.381
TO FEEL THEIR WAY
AROUND BLIND.

11:26.424 --> 11:29.297
AND HE WAS WATCHING THEM
WITH HIS GOGGLES ON.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.691
HE WANTED TO SEE
THEM STRUGGLE.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.824
NO. HE WANTED TO
SEE THEM PANIC.

11:34.868 --> 11:38.393
HE WANTED THEM TO KNOW
THAT AT ANY POINT,

11:38.436 --> 11:41.265
HE COULD STAB THEM,
WHICH HE DID

11:41.309 --> 11:44.007
RIGHT THERE
AND THEN HERE.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.966
WE THOUGHT THAT LAST
NIGHT'’S VICTIM GOT
LUCKY AND ESCAPED,

11:46.009 --> 11:48.185
BUT THIS CRIME SCENE
TELLS AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT STORY.

11:48.229 --> 11:51.188
YEAH. HE LET THEM
GO ON PURPOSE,

11:51.232 --> 11:53.103
FIRST IN A CONTROLLED
SETTING LIKE THIS,

11:53.147 --> 11:55.149
THEN OUT
IN THE WILD.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.064
SO LAST NIGHT'’S VICTIM
DIDN'’T GET LUCKY.

11:57.107 --> 12:00.763
NO. OUR UNSUB'’S
A HUNTER.

12:06.595 --> 12:08.553
NIKKI: IT'’S OK.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.991
BABY, IT'’S--
IT'’S OK.

12:12.906 --> 12:16.387
NIK, I CAN'’T SEE.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.520
JUST...
I CAN'’T SEE.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.827
FOCUS ON MY VOICE.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.742
I--I--

12:22.785 --> 12:24.744
THINK ABOUT THE PLACE
THAT WE MET.

12:24.787 --> 12:27.181
REMEMBER?

12:27.224 --> 12:29.923
BALBOA.
BALBOA ISLAND.

12:29.966 --> 12:34.057
REMEMBER THAT SUNSET?
OTHERWORLDLY, RIGHT?

12:34.101 --> 12:37.408
THE PINKS, THE BLUES.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.497
YEAH.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.891
J.P.: I WAS HOPING THAT
IF YOU NOTICED ME

12:41.935 --> 12:45.852
NOTICING THEM, YOU'’D
HAVE COFFEE WITH ME.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.898
NIK: IT WORKED.
IT DID.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.900
WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF THAT COFFEE SHOP?

12:50.944 --> 12:52.684
THE BALBOA ISLAND
COFFEE COMPANY.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.077
WE'’RE GONNA GO
BACK THERE, OK?

12:54.121 --> 12:55.252
YEAH.

12:55.296 --> 12:55.731
I PROMISE YOU, WE'’RE
GONNA MAKE IT BACK.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.690
SHH, SHH, SHH.
SHH, SHH, SHH.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.997
HE'’S COMING.
SHH. HE'’S COMING.

13:01.041 --> 13:04.131
I HEAR HIM.
SHH, SHH.

13:15.882 --> 13:19.363
UH...UH...

13:24.368 --> 13:26.196
J.P.: NIK. NIK?

13:26.240 --> 13:27.981
NO. NO.
NIK?

13:28.024 --> 13:30.287
NO, NO.
IT'’S MY TURN. HURT ME.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.942
HE'’S GOT A KNIFE.
WHAT?

13:32.986 --> 13:35.989
OH...OH...OH...

13:43.735 --> 13:45.955
COME ON.

13:53.963 --> 13:57.706
GET UP.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.885
NOW LET'’S SEE YOU
GET OUT OF HERE.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.018
GO ON. GET GOING.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.584
NIKKI: J.P.

14:06.628 --> 14:09.065
REID: BASED ON THE VIDEO,
THE UNSUB'’S GOGGLES

14:09.109 --> 14:10.850
USE A PROCESS
CALLED AMPLIFICATION

14:10.893 --> 14:12.242
WHICH INCREASES
THE AVAILABLE LIGHT

14:12.286 --> 14:14.244
IN ORDER TO MAKE IT BRIGHT
ENOUGH FOR EYES TO SEE IT.

14:14.288 --> 14:16.812
NOW, HE CAN SEE HIS VICTIMS,
BUT THEY CAN'’T SEE HIM,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.596
BUT HERE'’S THE PART
THAT DOESN'’T MAKE SENSE.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.381
ONCE THEY'’RE BLINDED,

14:20.424 --> 14:22.600
HE SHOULDN'’T NEED
TO WEAR THAT ANYMORE.

14:22.644 --> 14:25.690
OR IT COULD BE SYMBOLIC, OR
HE'’S MAKING A STATEMENT--

14:25.734 --> 14:28.171
COLORBLIND. LOVE IS BLIND,
BLIND JUSTICE.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.347
GARCIA,
YOU'’RE ON SPEAKER.

14:30.391 --> 14:31.914
GARCIA, ON PHONE:
OOH, I LIVE FOR SPEAKER. OK.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.090
I HAVE FOUND
ADDITIONAL SECURITY FOOTAGE

14:34.134 --> 14:37.441
OF OUR VIDEO GUY RUNNING--
OR SHOULD I SAY SPRINTING?--

14:37.485 --> 14:39.835
PAST 3 HOUSES IN ROXY HEIGHTS.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.360
SENT IT TO YOUR TABLETS
EXACTLY NOW.

14:43.404 --> 14:46.059
LEWIS: WOW.
BUT HE'’S REALLY MOVING.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.104
THIS IS AFTER TWO MILES
ACROSS OPEN FOREST,

14:48.148 --> 14:49.714
HE'’S STILL SPRINTING.

14:49.758 --> 14:50.933
WELL, THAT COULD BE
JUST ADRENALINE,

14:50.977 --> 14:52.630
BUT THIS GUY'’S GOT
PERFECT FORM.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.937
PRENTISS: HE'’S ALSO WEARING
AN EXERCISE WATCH.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.287
THIS VICTIM TRAINED REGULARLY.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.115
LEWIS: WELL, MAYBE HE'’S
A RUNNER FROM OUT-OF-TOWN.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.943
ARE THERE ANY
UPCOMING MARATHONS?

15:00.987 --> 15:02.423
POLICE CHIEF:
YES, TOMORROW.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.816
THERE'’S A HALF-MARATHON
FOR BREAST CANCER RESEARCH.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.644
I'’VE RUN IT
A FEW TIMES MYSELF

15:06.688 --> 15:08.168
IN MEMORY OF
MY AUNT JOYCE.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.910
GARCIA, I WANT YOU TO RUN
THE ENTRANTS'’ NAMES.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.086
CROSS-REFERENCE THEM
WITH THEIR BIB PHOTOS

15:13.129 --> 15:15.305
AND THE VIDEO STILLS
OF OUR MISSING MAN.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.612
LOOK FOR
ROMANTIC COUPLES
RUNNING TOGETHER,

15:17.655 --> 15:19.135
MARRIED OR DOMESTIC,

15:19.179 --> 15:21.050
SPANNING SEXUAL
PREFERENCE LINES.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.792
ALL OVER IT, BOSS, LIKE BEANIES
ON MAN BUNS ON HIPSTERS.

15:26.447 --> 15:27.883
OH. HERE WE GO.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.842
J.P. McCOY--32,
NIKKI PARENO--29,

15:30.886 --> 15:32.975
RECENTLY ENGAGED, FROM
HUNTINGTON BEACH, CALIFORNIA.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.021
HE'’S A FINANCIAL PLANNER.
SHE'’S A VET TECH.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.588
LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE STAYING
AT A HOME-SHARE RENTAL

15:37.632 --> 15:39.329
THEY GOT OFF COZYNEST.

15:39.373 --> 15:40.765
IT'’S JUST LIKE AIRBnB.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.854
IT'’S TEMPORARY RENTALS,
HAVING TO TRUST STRANGERS.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.944
IT'’S PRETTY RISKY
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.902
ADDRESS SENT.

15:53.213 --> 15:55.345
NIK...

15:55.389 --> 15:57.869
NIK, IS HE GONE?

15:57.913 --> 15:59.349
I THINK SO.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.655
J.P.: OK. YEAH.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.178
I GOT TO GET
YOU FREE.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.310
NO, NO, NO ,NO, NO.
NO. NO.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.964
HE'’S GONNA BE
RIGHT BACK.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.444
PLEASE, J.P.
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.533
I'’LL TRY AND HELP YOU.

16:09.577 --> 16:14.756
THERE'’S A STAIRCASE ABOUT
12 FEET AHEAD OF YOU.

16:14.799 --> 16:18.151
KEEP GOING. THAT'’S IT.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.239
OK.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.552
LEWIS, ROSSI, TAKE THE BACK.
WAIT FOR MY MARK.

16:28.596 --> 16:29.858
NOW BE CAREFUL.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.251
TAKE THE HAND RAIL

16:31.294 --> 16:33.253
AND JUST TAKE ONE
STEP AT A TIME, OK?

16:33.296 --> 16:35.211
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

16:35.255 --> 16:37.909
MAN: MOVING INTO
POSITION.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.914
NIK, NIK, NIK,
I HEAR VOICES.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.134
YOU CAN DO THIS, J.P.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.744
JUST HEAD TOWARD
THEIR VOICES.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.850
OK. WE'’RE READY.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.603
1, 2, 3.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.267
CLEAR.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.575
THEY'’RE NOT HERE.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.319
UH!
HUH...

17:50.417 --> 17:52.897
HE CUT OFF THE POWER
HERE, AS WELL.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.725
THIS IS HOW
HE GAINS CONTROL.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.032
RIGHT. SO THEY RUN OUTSIDE
TO CHECK THE FUSE BOX.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.338
HE GETS INSIDE.

17:58.381 --> 17:59.861
THEY COME BACK IN,
AND THEY'’RE IMMEDIATELY

17:59.904 --> 18:01.254
AT A DISADVANTAGE
IN THE DARK.

18:01.297 --> 18:02.516
JUST LIKE
THE MENDELBAUMS.

18:02.559 --> 18:03.952
YEAH, BUT THAT'’S
WHERE IT ENDS.

18:03.995 --> 18:06.172
I MEAN, THERE'’S NO STUMBLING
AROUND IN THE DARK HERE.

18:06.215 --> 18:08.261
THERE'’S NO HANDPRINTS
AT ALL BEYOND THE USUAL.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.785
HE DID NOT
KILL THEM HERE.

18:10.828 --> 18:14.832
SO THE UNSUB MOVED THEM
TO A SECONDARY LOCATION.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.617
IT'’S RISKY TO MOVE
TWO PEOPLE.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.619
WHY DO IT,

18:18.662 --> 18:20.795
AND HOW DO YOU DO IT
WITHOUT BEING SEEN?

18:20.838 --> 18:23.450
ALL RIGHT,
SO WE KNOW THIS GUY

18:23.493 --> 18:25.974
LIKES TO TAKE BIG RISKS,
WHICH HE'’S DONE HERE

18:26.017 --> 18:28.150
BY COMING ALL THE WAY
ACROSS TOWN TO THIS HOUSE,

18:28.194 --> 18:29.630
BUT WE STILL
DON'’T KNOW

18:29.673 --> 18:31.153
WHY THIS HOUSE
IS SO SPECIAL.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.155
ISRAEL KEYES EVADED
CAPTURE FOR DECADES

18:33.199 --> 18:35.331
BECAUSE HE
CRACKED THE CODE.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.159
RIGHT. DON'’T KILL ANYBODY
CONNECTED TO YOU,

18:37.203 --> 18:39.292
AND DON'’T KILL IN A SPACE
THAT CAN BE CONNECTED TO YOU.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.424
WELL, MAYBE THIS UNSUB
DID HIS RESEARCH

18:41.468 --> 18:43.818
AND FIGURED
THAT OUT, TOO.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.820
ALL RIGHT, SO MAYBE
THIS GUY'’S SMART ENOUGH

18:45.863 --> 18:48.127
TO HAVE CREATED A SPECIAL
LAYER OF PROTECTION

18:48.170 --> 18:49.998
BY USING COZYNEST TO
FIND AND ATTACK STRANGERS,

18:50.041 --> 18:52.043
OR IT'’S THE OPPOSITE,
AND THERE'’S SOME KIND

18:52.087 --> 18:54.611
OF AN EMOTIONAL TIE
AND HE CHOSE THIS
HOUSE PURPOSEFULLY.

18:54.655 --> 18:57.136
ALVEZ: YOUR DADDY
SAID YOU'’RE SORT OF

18:57.179 --> 18:58.920
A NIGHT OWL AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.314
I HAVE A HARD TIME SLEEPING,
AND I LIKE THE NIGHT.

19:01.357 --> 19:04.012
ANYTHING HAPPEN LAST
NIGHT THAT'’S A LITTLE

19:04.055 --> 19:05.840
OUT OF THE NORMAL
ROUTINE FOR AROUND HERE?

19:05.883 --> 19:07.363
OUR NEIGHBORS LIKE
TO RENT THEIR PLACE OUT

19:07.407 --> 19:08.669
ON COZYNEST,
SO IT'’S ALWAYS

19:08.712 --> 19:10.453
A MIXED BAG
NEXT DOOR.

19:10.497 --> 19:13.587
WELL, DID YOU SEE
ANYONE COMING OR GOING?

19:13.630 --> 19:16.111
WELL, EARLIER,
I WAS IN MY ROOM,

19:16.155 --> 19:17.852
AND I SAW THE GUY
AND A GIRL COME HOME,

19:17.895 --> 19:19.201
MUST HAVE BEEN
FROM A RUN.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.507
WHAT ABOUT AFTER THAT?

19:20.550 --> 19:22.204
I THOUGHT THEY INVITED
A FRIEND OVER BECAUSE

19:22.248 --> 19:25.294
I SAW THIS GUY HELPING
THE RUNNER DUDE INTO A CAR.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.470
THE NEW GUY, WHAT
DID HE LOOK LIKE?

19:27.514 --> 19:29.342
DARK CLOTHES, A HOODIE.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.474
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM MADE ME
ASSUME HE WAS A DEALER,

19:31.518 --> 19:33.215
YOU KNOW?

19:33.259 --> 19:36.087
HE HAD THESE WEIRD
SUNGLASSES ON AND EVERYTHING.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.568
THESE SUNGLASSES, WHAT
WAS WEIRD ABOUT THEM,

19:38.612 --> 19:40.527
I MEAN, OTHER THAN HE
HAD THEM ON AT NIGHT?

19:40.570 --> 19:42.964
HAD SOMETHING
SHINY ON THEM,

19:43.007 --> 19:45.053
LIKE A STRIPE
OR SOMETHING.

19:45.096 --> 19:46.881
IT CAUGHT MY EYE WHEN
HE OPENED THE CAR DOOR

19:46.924 --> 19:48.665
AND THE OVERHEAD
LIGHT WENT ON.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.319
IF I WERE TO SHOW
YOU A PICTURE

19:50.363 --> 19:52.539
OF THESE SUNGLASSES, WOULD
YOU BE ABLE TO I.D. THEM?

19:52.582 --> 19:55.019
YEAH. SURE.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.240
THAT'’S THEM.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.373
THANKS, MAN.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.941
WE NEED TO DELIVER
THE PROFILE.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.642
THE UNSUB WE'’RE LOOKING FOR
IS BELIEVED TO BE A WHITE MALE

20:08.685 --> 20:12.298
IN HIS LATE 20s TO EARLY 30s
WHO IS VISUALLY IMPAIRED.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.038
ALVEZ: NOW, BASED ON
EYEWITNESS CONFIRMATION,

20:14.082 --> 20:15.649
HE'’S WEARING THESE.

20:15.692 --> 20:18.129
THEY'’RE ELECTRONIC SUNGLASSES
THAT HELP HIM SEE IN THE DARK.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.654
WOMAN: SO HE'’S BLIND? THAT
SHOULD MAKE HIM EASY TO FIND.

20:20.697 --> 20:22.830
REID: NO. HE'’S IMPAIRED,
NOT FULLY SIGHTLESS,

20:22.873 --> 20:24.440
AND WITH THE AID
OF THE GLASSES

20:24.484 --> 20:26.050
AND THE NIGHT-VISION
GOGGLES, HE MOST LIKELY

20:26.094 --> 20:27.922
HAS CLOSE
TO FULL VISION.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.490
WHAT'’S MORE RELEVANT FOR
OUR PROFILE, HOWEVER,

20:30.533 --> 20:32.318
IS THAT BEHIND
THIS DISABILITY LURKS

20:32.361 --> 20:35.669
A PSYCHOPATH INCAPABLE
OF FEELING EMPATHY.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.714
BUT HIS RAGE OVER
HIS CONDITION
IS NOW EXTERNALIZED

20:37.758 --> 20:40.717
ON HIS VICTIMS,
INCLUDING ANYONE WHO
SHOWS HIM ANY EMPATHY.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.980
LEWIS: IT'’S ALSO POSSIBLE
THAT THIS UNSUB HAS LEARNED

20:43.024 --> 20:45.026
HOW TO WEAPONIZE
HIS DISABILITY

20:45.069 --> 20:46.854
IN ORDER TO MAKE
HIMSELF SEEM

20:46.897 --> 20:48.421
LESS THREATENING
TO HIS VICTIMS.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.684
ROSSI: HOWEVER, THIS UNSUB
HAS LIMITED SOCIAL SKILLS.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.208
HIS DISABILITY HAS KEPT HIM
WITHDRAWN AND ISOLATED.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.341
THAT'’S WHY HE'S TAKEN
HIS OWN IMPAIRMENT OUT

20:55.384 --> 20:56.994
ON HIS VICTIMS.

20:57.038 --> 20:59.693
HE WANTS THEM TO KNOW
WHAT IT'’S LIKE TO BE HIM.

20:59.736 --> 21:02.217
BRINGING THEM TO HIS LEVEL
ALLOWS HIM TO DRAW OUT

21:02.261 --> 21:06.265
THE TORTURE AND ENGAGE
IN CAT-AND-MOUSE-TYPE
PLAY WITH THEM.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.049
PSYCHOPATHS
GET BORED EASILY.

21:08.092 --> 21:10.660
THAT'’S WHY THEY TAKE
BIGGER AND BIGGER RISKS.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.706
THAT'’S WHY HE RELEASED J.P.,

21:12.749 --> 21:15.056
AND WE EXPECT HIM TO CONTINUE
TO ESCALATE WITH NIKKI.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.449
WHAT DOES THAT
LOOK LIKE?

21:16.492 --> 21:18.320
REID: IT COULD BE PRETENDING
TO CARE ABOUT HER

21:18.364 --> 21:20.366
OR PRETENDING TO LET HER GO
AFTER HE BLINDS HER.

21:20.409 --> 21:23.543
NIKKI MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE
IF SHE CAN PROVE THAT

21:23.586 --> 21:26.197
SHE SEES HIM AS A HUMAN BEING
INSTEAD OF A MONSTER,

21:26.241 --> 21:28.025
WHICH IS HOW HE FEELS.

21:30.114 --> 21:32.943
J.P., YOU MADE--

21:32.987 --> 21:35.381
OH...OH...

21:35.424 --> 21:39.080
OH...DID YOU
HURT HIM?

21:39.123 --> 21:41.604
DID YOU?

21:41.648 --> 21:44.825
OH, PLEASE. NO.

21:44.868 --> 21:47.393
OH...

21:50.831 --> 21:53.268
UH...

21:53.312 --> 21:56.227
UH...

21:56.271 --> 21:58.752
YOU DON'’T
HAVE TO KILL ME.

21:58.795 --> 22:00.710
LET ME GO. I WON'’T
SAY ANYTHING.

22:09.066 --> 22:11.025
LOOK AT ME.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.725
ARE YOU REPULSED BY ME?

22:18.641 --> 22:21.427
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

22:21.470 --> 22:24.430
I WANT TO KNOW.
PLEASE TELL ME.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.140
WHOA.

22:39.183 --> 22:40.315
REID, ON PHONE:
WHAT'’D YOU FIND, GARCIA?

22:40.359 --> 22:42.143
WELL, THE FIRST
TWO VICTIMS WERE

22:42.186 --> 22:44.624
VERY WELL-RESPECTED, JUST
LIKE THEIR SON REPORTED,

22:44.667 --> 22:47.409
BUT DR. MENDELBAUM WAS NOT
WITHOUT A CHECKERED PAST.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.759
I'’M SENDING YOU
A NEWS CLIPPING NOW.

22:49.803 --> 22:52.893
YOU ARE, I'’M SURE,
AWARE OF EXPOSURE THERAPY.

22:52.936 --> 22:54.938
IT'’S A FORM OF COGNITIVE
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY

22:54.982 --> 22:56.462
THAT'’S BEEN AROUND
SINCE THE 1950s IN WHICH

22:56.505 --> 22:59.334
A PATIENT IS FORCED
TO CONFRONT THEIR ANXIETIES.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.423
TAKE ARACHNOPHOBIA,
FOR INSTANCE.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.295
UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF A DOCTOR
AND/OR A PSYCHOLOGIST,

23:04.339 --> 23:06.428
A PATIENT IS METHODICALLY
INTRODUCED TO SPIDERS

23:06.472 --> 23:08.125
IN A CONTROLLED SETTING,
THE IDEA BEING THAT

23:08.169 --> 23:09.779
THE MORE FAMILIAR
THEY ARE WITH ARACHNIDS--

23:09.823 --> 23:11.302
THE LESS
YOU FEAR THEM.

23:11.346 --> 23:12.695
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
DR. MENDELBAUM

23:12.739 --> 23:14.610
WAS TRYING THIS OUT
WITH HIS PATIENTS.

23:14.654 --> 23:15.959
GARCIA: TWO--CORRECT
ME IF I'’M WRONG,

23:16.003 --> 23:18.397
AND I WANT TO BE WRONG--
WERE CHILDREN, NO?

23:18.440 --> 23:19.963
REID: THEY WERE, AND
EXPOSURE THERAPY WITH CHILDREN

23:20.007 --> 23:21.661
HAS TO BE ADMINISTERED
WITH EXTREME CARE,

23:21.704 --> 23:23.619
OR IT CAN BE INTERPRETED
AS NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT,

23:23.663 --> 23:25.621
COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.144
RAY WITHHELD DETAILS

23:27.188 --> 23:29.625
ABOUT HIS PARENTS'’
MURDER FROM THE POLICE.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.453
CONSCIOUSLY
OR UNCONSCIOUSLY,

23:31.497 --> 23:33.324
HE MAY HAVE FEARED
THAT THIS PLAYED
A PART IN IT.

23:33.368 --> 23:34.717
WELL, IF THE UNSUB WAS
ONE OF HIS DAD'’S PATIENTS,

23:34.761 --> 23:36.502
HE MIGHT BE RIGHT.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.460
ONE OF THESE KIDS
TOOK HIS OWN LIFE

23:38.504 --> 23:41.332
ONLY AFTER A FEW SESSIONS
OF EXPOSURE THERAPY,

23:41.376 --> 23:43.770
BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR
YOUR FATHER TO DISCONTINUE

23:43.813 --> 23:45.902
HIS WORK AND TAKE
A LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

23:45.946 --> 23:49.340
NO. THAT CASE HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FOLKS.

23:49.384 --> 23:50.994
WE SETTLED
WITH THE FAMILY.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.779
WE AGREE, BUT YOUR
PARENTS'’ KILLER

23:52.822 --> 23:54.520
COULD HAVE BEEN
ANOTHER KID
HE TREATED.

23:57.218 --> 23:59.568
RAY--

23:59.612 --> 24:02.005
RAY, WE KNOW YOUR
FATHER WAS A GOOD MAN

24:02.049 --> 24:04.486
AND A GOOD DOCTOR,

24:04.530 --> 24:06.662
THAT HE REGULARLY
GAVE FREE CHECKUPS,

24:06.706 --> 24:08.490
AND MEDICAL CARE
TO AT-RISK KIDS.

24:08.534 --> 24:11.014
REID: EVEN GOOD MEN
MAKE MISTAKES.

24:11.058 --> 24:14.191
YOU NEED TO HELP US
FIX WHAT YOUR DAD DID

24:14.235 --> 24:16.193
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,
HIS KILLER

24:16.237 --> 24:18.282
HAS TWO MORE VICTIMS
SOMEPLACE.

24:21.677 --> 24:25.420
HE KEPT DETAILED RECORDS.
WE STILL HAVE THEM.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.857
JJ: WE'’RE GONNA NEED
TO SEE THOSE.

24:27.901 --> 24:30.686
WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME?

24:30.730 --> 24:33.733
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

24:42.306 --> 24:44.570
AAH!

24:44.613 --> 24:46.746
AAH!

24:58.105 --> 25:00.977
IS THIS
ANOTHER GAME?

25:01.021 --> 25:03.719
NO.

25:03.763 --> 25:06.330
NO MORE GAMES.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.205
YOU'’RE GONNA BE MY EYES.

25:19.648 --> 25:22.216
HE KEPT ALL OF HIS
OLD PATIENT RECORDS,

25:22.259 --> 25:25.785
EVEN THE NOT
SO SUCCESSFUL ONES.

25:25.828 --> 25:30.050
HE WAS WRITING A MEMOIR
ABOUT HIS RESEARCH,

25:30.093 --> 25:32.879
EVEN ADMITTING HIS FAILURES,
IN HOPES TO FIND

25:32.922 --> 25:35.577
A BETTER WAY
TO HELP THESE KIDS.

25:35.621 --> 25:39.146
IF YOU DON'’T MIND,
I'’LL LEAVE YOU TO IT.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.887
HEY, UM...

25:40.930 --> 25:43.193
I KNOW THIS IS
REALLY HARD FOR YOU.

25:43.237 --> 25:44.847
WE REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

25:47.937 --> 25:50.766
OH, TALK ABOUT
A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.681
AND THEY'’RE ANONYMIZED,
NO NAMES.

25:52.725 --> 25:55.902
HUH. OK, WELL,
A NEEDLE
IN AN OCEAN.

25:55.945 --> 26:00.428
SO ACCORDING TO GARCIA,
THE STUDY TOOK PLACE

26:00.471 --> 26:03.431
FROM THE LATE NINETIES
TO THE EARLY 2000s,

26:03.474 --> 26:04.824
SO LET'’S JUST
PULL EVERYTHING

26:04.867 --> 26:06.086
FROM THAT
TIME FRAME.

26:06.129 --> 26:08.088
DR. MENDELBAUM SEEMED
TO FOCUS ON PATIENTS

26:08.131 --> 26:10.220
SUFFERING FROM
SEPARATION ANXIETY,

26:10.264 --> 26:12.266
WHICH IS A COMMON
CONDITION IN CHILDHOOD.

26:12.309 --> 26:13.920
AND THIS SORT OF THERAPY
CAN BE EFFECTIVE

26:13.963 --> 26:15.443
WITH PROPER SUPERVISION,

26:15.486 --> 26:17.619
BUT WITHOUT
THE PROPER GUIDANCE,

26:17.663 --> 26:19.142
IT CAN HAVE
THE OPPOSITE EFFECT.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.970
IT CAN TAKE
AN OTHERWISE EFFECTIVE
FORM OF THERAPY

26:21.014 --> 26:23.538
AND TURN IT INTO
AN ENDLESS FORM OF TORTURE.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.975
AND HOW WOULD THAT
ANXIETY MANIFEST?

26:26.019 --> 26:27.716
CRYING IN SCHOOL,
FEAR OF DROWNING,

26:27.760 --> 26:30.153
REFUSAL
TO SLEEP ALONE.

26:30.197 --> 26:32.112
FEAR OF THE DARK?

26:32.155 --> 26:33.983
ABSOLUTELY.
NYCTOPHOBIA.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.768
THIS FILE MIGHT
BE OUR UNSUB--

26:35.811 --> 26:38.335
NUMBER 20411.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.642
ONE OF THE PRIMARY
TREATMENTS
IS DESENSITIZATION,

26:40.686 --> 26:42.165
INCREMENTAL,
NONTHREATENING INTERVALS

26:42.209 --> 26:43.993
OF DARKNESS,
KIND OF LIKE BEING
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.516
THAT'’S NOT GOOD.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.561
NO. IT IS NOT.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.954
OK, SO IT LOOKS LIKE
HE WAS A PATIENT

26:47.997 --> 26:50.347
FOR 14 MONTHS BEFORE
THE STUDY WAS STOPPED.

26:50.391 --> 26:54.830
THE DOC WAS TRYING
A MORE AGGRESSIVE
APPROACH--

26:54.874 --> 26:57.354
LONGER PERIODS OF
ISOLATION IN THE DARK,

26:57.398 --> 26:59.879
THE USE OF BLINDFOLDS
WITHIN HYPNOSIS--

26:59.922 --> 27:02.185
SINCE THIS PATIENT HAD
SUCH A SEVERE CASE.

27:02.229 --> 27:03.839
THAT'’S NOT LONG ENOUGH
FOR IRREVERSIBLE

27:03.883 --> 27:06.537
BRAIN DAMAGE, BUT IT
THE DOCTOR STOPPED
HIS THERAPY

27:06.581 --> 27:08.191
AFTER HIS OTHER
PATIENT'’S SUICIDE,

27:08.235 --> 27:09.628
THE UNSUB'’S PARENTS
MIGHT HAVE DECIDED

27:09.671 --> 27:11.847
TO CONTINUE THE THERAPY
UNSUPERVISED.

27:11.891 --> 27:15.198
OR EVEN AS A WAY TO PUNISH
HIM WHEN HE ACTED OUT,

27:15.242 --> 27:16.722
LOCKING HIM IN THE DARK,
THINKING THEY'’RE

27:16.765 --> 27:19.028
HELPING HIM,
TOUGHENING HIM UP--

27:19.072 --> 27:21.378
THEIR PSEUDO,
AMATEUR VERSION OF

27:21.422 --> 27:23.642
THE DOCTOR'’S TREATMENT,
COMPLETELY DANGEROUS,

27:23.685 --> 27:25.861
UPPING THE ANTE
AND RETRAUMATIZING HIM.

27:25.905 --> 27:28.995
WE NEED TO CRACK THIS CODE
AND FIND PATIENT 20411.

27:31.954 --> 27:34.348
SO NOW THAT YOU
KNOW THE TRUTH...

27:37.133 --> 27:40.049
YOU STILL WANT
TO HELP ME?

27:40.093 --> 27:42.225
YES.

27:42.269 --> 27:44.227
I PROMISE THAT
I'’LL HELP YOU,

27:44.271 --> 27:47.622
BUT FIRST, I WANT
TO SEE J.P., PLEASE.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.628
GO.

27:55.282 --> 27:57.327
GO.

28:08.512 --> 28:11.341
PRENTISS: I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE WITH GARCIA.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.300
THE OWNERS OF THE COZYNEST HOUSE
WHERE J.P. AND NIKKI

28:13.343 --> 28:15.041
WERE ABDUCTED
ARE OUT OF TOWN.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.478
HOWEVER, WE WERE ABLE
TO TRACK DOWN THEIR DAUGHTER,

28:17.521 --> 28:19.088
WHO MANAGES THE RENTAL
IN THEIR ABSENCE.

28:19.132 --> 28:20.655
SHE'’S ON HER WAY IN.

28:20.699 --> 28:21.656
GREAT.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.962
IT'’S GOT TO BE HERE.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.224
I'’VE APPLIED EVERY POTENTIAL
NUMERIC ALGORITHM,

28:24.267 --> 28:25.616
AND SO FAR, NOTHING.

28:25.660 --> 28:26.879
SIMMONS: WELL, IF
THIS EXPOSURE THERAPY

28:26.922 --> 28:28.619
WAS THE UNSUB'’S STRESSOR,

28:28.663 --> 28:30.752
WHY WAIT UNTIL NOW
TO TAKE HIS REVENGE?

28:30.796 --> 28:32.449
HE COULD HAVE
BEEN LOCKED UP.

28:32.493 --> 28:34.625
OR MOVED AWAY
OR HAD BEEN HOSPITALIZED.

28:34.669 --> 28:36.497
MORE TO THE POINT,
WHY GO AFTER

28:36.540 --> 28:39.108
A SEEMINGLY RANDOM COUPLE
LIKE J.P. AND NIKKI?

28:39.152 --> 28:42.285
IT JUST
DOESN'’T ADD UP

28:42.329 --> 28:45.462
UNLESS IT WAS ABOUT

28:45.506 --> 28:47.334
THE HOME
THEY'’RE STAYING IN

28:47.377 --> 28:49.423
AND NOT ABOUT
THEM SPECIFICALLY.

28:49.466 --> 28:53.296
THIS GUY ABSOLUTELY
LIVES FOR THE HUNT,

28:53.340 --> 28:57.170
SO WHAT IF THIS
ISN'’T ONLY ABOUT

28:57.213 --> 28:59.781
REENACTING HIS TRAUMA
BUT IT'’S ALSO

28:59.825 --> 29:01.696
ABOUT UNFINISHED
BUSINESS?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.393
SIMMONS: BUT
WITH WHO, THOUGH?

29:03.437 --> 29:05.482
I MEAN, WHO'’S LEFT
FOR HIM TO HUNT?

29:15.536 --> 29:18.278
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

29:18.321 --> 29:21.281
YOU HELP ME,
I'’LL HELP YOU.

29:24.284 --> 29:27.200
THESE CODES REPRESENT CHILDREN,
BUT THEY'’RE OBSCURE

29:27.243 --> 29:30.681
TO PROTECT THEM,
PERSONALLY CONNECTED

29:30.725 --> 29:32.901
BUT SUPERSEDES NUMERICAL LOGIC.

29:35.382 --> 29:38.298
HOME ADDRESS.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.474
LEWIS: DO YOU
RECOGNIZE THIS MAN?

29:40.517 --> 29:43.129
NO, BUT I'’M CONFUSED.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.522
YOU SAID THESE PEOPLE
WERE ABDUCTED BY THIS MAN.

29:45.566 --> 29:47.698
ARE THEY DEAD?

29:47.742 --> 29:50.005
RIGHT NOW,
THEY'’RE MISSING,

29:50.049 --> 29:52.355
BUT THE LAST PLACE THAT
THEY WERE SEEN ALIVE

29:52.399 --> 29:54.357
WAS AT YOUR PARENTS'’
RENTAL HOUSE.

29:54.401 --> 29:56.359
YOU TAKE CARE
OF THAT FOR THEM?

29:56.403 --> 29:58.187
YEAH. I MEAN,
I JUST MAKE SURE

29:58.231 --> 29:59.841
PEOPLE GET
CHECKED IN AND OUT

29:59.885 --> 30:01.843
AND THAT THE PLACE
GETS CLEANED UP
IN BETWEEN GUESTS.

30:01.887 --> 30:04.063
YOU EVER HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
WITH ANY OTHER GUESTS?

30:04.106 --> 30:05.586
YOU EVER HAVE
TO GO OUT THERE?

30:05.629 --> 30:07.849
NO. WITH THE WEBSITE,
IT PRETTY MUCH RUNS ITSELF.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.504
THIS WAS JUST A WAY FOR THEM
TO MAKE SOME EXTRA MONEY.

30:10.547 --> 30:12.114
WE DON'’T BELIEVE
THE SUSPECT WENT

30:12.158 --> 30:14.682
TO YOUR
PARENTS'’ HOUSE
BY COINCIDENCE.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.727
YOU THINK THEY
WERE THE TARGET?

30:16.771 --> 30:18.773
IT'’S POSSIBLE.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.470
DID YOU
GROW UP THERE?

30:20.514 --> 30:24.735
YEAH, BUT MY PARENTS
ARE QUIET, HOMEBODIES.

30:24.779 --> 30:28.565
I DON'’T KNOW WHO WOULD
EVEN DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

30:28.609 --> 30:34.615
DOES THE NUMBER
20411 MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

30:39.098 --> 30:40.839
CHRISTIAN,
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

30:43.406 --> 30:45.713
I HAVEN'’T TALKED
ABOUT THIS IN--

30:47.019 --> 30:49.673
I DON'’T EVEN KNOW IF--

30:49.717 --> 30:53.764
IT'’S ALL RIGHT.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

30:53.808 --> 30:56.898
IN HIGH SCHOOL, I WENT
TO THIS BONFIRE PARTY

30:56.942 --> 30:59.466
IN THE WOODS.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.772
THERE WAS A LOT
OF DRINKING, YOU KNOW,

31:01.816 --> 31:04.775
TYPICAL HIGH-SCHOOL
STUFF.

31:04.819 --> 31:08.605
THIS BOY CONVINCED ME
TO TAKE HIM

31:08.649 --> 31:13.784
TO INSPIRATION POINT,
THE LOCAL OVERLOOK.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.917
MARS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE VISIBLE,

31:15.961 --> 31:19.790
AND HE WANTED ME TO
DESCRIBE IT FOR HIM.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.532
I FELT BAD FOR HIM,
SO I WENT.

31:22.576 --> 31:25.753
BECAUSE
HE WAS BLIND?

31:25.796 --> 31:30.714
I MEAN,
NOT COMPLETELY.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.980
HE--

31:42.857 --> 31:45.947
HE TRIED TO HOLD ME DOWN,

31:45.991 --> 31:48.036
EVEN WRAPPED TAPE
AROUND MY WRISTS

31:48.080 --> 31:51.474
AND TIED A SCARF AROUND MY EYES.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.824
I KEPT FIGHTING
AND MANAGED TO GET AWAY,

31:53.868 --> 31:56.610
BUT HE CAME AFTER ME,

31:56.653 --> 31:59.308
LAUGHING.

31:59.352 --> 32:02.311
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
SO SCARED IN MY LIFE,

32:02.355 --> 32:04.139
AND I STARTED SCREAMING,
AND, THANKFULLY,

32:04.183 --> 32:06.925
ONE OF MY FRIENDS HEARD ME
AND CAME RUNNING,

32:06.968 --> 32:12.147
BUT THE LOOK
ON THIS GUY'’S FACE,

32:12.191 --> 32:14.845
HE WAS CLEARLY ENJOYING IT,

32:14.889 --> 32:17.457
AND HE COULD SEE BETTER
THAN HE LET ON.

32:19.372 --> 32:22.331
HIS HOUSE
WAS RIGHT BY MY SCHOOL,

32:22.375 --> 32:24.986
AND EVERY DAY, I WAS REMINDED,

32:25.030 --> 32:28.337
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

32:28.381 --> 32:31.993
IT MADE ME SICK.

32:32.037 --> 32:36.650
HE LIVED AT
20411 MANSARD LANE.

32:36.693 --> 32:40.001
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

32:40.045 --> 32:42.873
COULD I POSSIBLY
EVER FORGET IT?

32:42.917 --> 32:45.659
IT'’S DUSTIN EISWORTH.

32:45.702 --> 32:47.966
GARCIA: DUSTIN EISWORTH--SON
OF TROY AND PATRICIA EISWORTH

32:48.009 --> 32:51.534
OF 20411 MANSARD LANE.

32:51.578 --> 32:54.320
HE TICKS ALL OF
THE TROUBLED-YOUTH BOXES.

32:54.363 --> 32:56.017
SENDING YOU DIRECTIONS NOW.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.584
LEWIS: ALL RIGHT.
WE'’RE ON OUR WAY.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.020
SAME.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.456
PRENTISS: GARCIA, WHAT ELSE
DO WE NEED TO KNOW?

33:00.500 --> 33:02.023
GARCIA, ON PHONE: WELL,
HE WAS KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL

33:02.067 --> 33:03.894
FOR A CORNUCOPIA
OF DISCIPLINARY ISSUES,

33:03.938 --> 33:07.637
INCLUDING CHRISTIAN'’S
ACCOUNT OF THE ASSAULT.

33:07.681 --> 33:09.726
THEN HE WENT TO REFORM SCHOOL.

33:09.770 --> 33:13.034
THEN HE WENT TO PRISON
FOR GETTING IN A BAR FIGHT

33:13.078 --> 33:16.124
THAT LEFT ONE MAN
PERMANENTLY BLIND.

33:16.168 --> 33:17.908
HE WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO SERVE
3 YEARS IN PRISON.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.432
HE ENDED UP SERVING 10,

33:19.475 --> 33:21.564
MOST OF THOSE
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT,

33:21.608 --> 33:23.436
AFTER KILLING ANOTHER INMATE.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.003
LET ME GUESS.
HE JUST GOT OUT.

33:25.046 --> 33:26.178
GARCIA, ON PHONE.
3 WEEKS AGO.

33:26.221 --> 33:28.180
SO DUSTIN SAT IN PRISON
FOR OVER A DECADE,

33:28.223 --> 33:30.051
HIS RESENTMENT
BUILDING UP.

33:30.095 --> 33:31.531
REID, ON PHONE: NOT TO MENTION,
HIS VISUAL CONDITION

33:31.574 --> 33:33.054
WOULD BE SEVERELY
DETERIORATED

33:33.098 --> 33:34.795
DUE TO ALL THAT
TIME IN SOLITARY.

33:34.838 --> 33:36.057
ALVEZ, ON PHONE: WELL, IF HE'’S
STAYING AT HIS PARENTS'’ HOUSE,

33:36.101 --> 33:37.754
HE KILLED THEM,
FIRST BLINDING THEM

33:37.798 --> 33:39.756
SO THAT THEY COULD
KNOW HOW HE FELT,

33:39.800 --> 33:41.410
THEN OFF TO
THE MENDELBAUMS'’.

33:41.454 --> 33:43.586
NEXT, HE WENT LOOKING
FOR CHRISTIAN RUSSO

33:43.630 --> 33:45.936
BECAUSE SHE'’S THE ONE THAT
GOT HIM KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL

33:45.980 --> 33:48.069
BUT FOUND NIKKI AND J.P.
INSTEAD.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.549
AND NOW HE'’S RECREATING

33:49.592 --> 33:51.029
HIS CAT-AND-MOUSE POWER
PLAY WITH THEM.

33:51.072 --> 33:52.552
HE WON'’T GO DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

33:52.595 --> 33:55.381
DO NOT
UNDERESTIMATE
THIS MAN.

34:13.834 --> 34:16.837
DO YOU SEE THEM?

34:18.665 --> 34:20.232
I TRIED
TO FORGIVE THEM

34:20.275 --> 34:23.713
JUST LIKE I TRIED TO
FORGIVE DR. MENDELBAUM.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.498
YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAID?

34:25.541 --> 34:28.457
DEAR OLD MOM AND DAD,
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID?

34:28.501 --> 34:31.808
THEY SAID I WAS SICK.

34:31.852 --> 34:35.290
WELL, THEY
MADE ME SICK,

34:35.334 --> 34:40.817
AND THEN I WENT
TO GET CHRISTIAN,

34:40.861 --> 34:46.562
BUT I FOUND YOU THERE,
YOU AND J.P.

34:48.173 --> 34:53.134
NO. NO. PLEASE. J.P.--

34:53.178 --> 34:55.615
J.P., J.P.

34:57.356 --> 34:58.313
NO!

34:58.357 --> 34:59.532
DUSTIN: WHAT
DID YOU THINK?

34:59.575 --> 35:02.143
WHAT, YOU THOUGHT
I WOULD KEEP HIM ALIVE?

35:02.187 --> 35:03.753
YOU THOUGHT I WOULD
LET YOU GO?

35:03.797 --> 35:06.539
YOU THOUGHT I NEEDED YOUR HELP?

35:06.582 --> 35:10.151
I MIGHT BE GOING BLIND,
BUT I'’M NOT STUPID.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.588
I COULD SEE
RIGHT THROUGH YOU.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.464
EVERYONE THINKS THEY'’RE
BETTER THAN DUSTIN.

35:18.507 --> 35:21.031
EVERYONE THINKS
THEY'’RE STRONGER
THAN ME

35:21.075 --> 35:23.033
AND THEY'’RE SMARTER THAN ME,
THAT I'’M STILL

35:23.077 --> 35:25.688
THAT SCARED LITTLE BOY
AFRAID OF THE DARK.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.212
YAAH!

35:27.255 --> 35:29.953
AH! UH...

35:29.997 --> 35:31.999
DUSTIN: UH!

36:01.159 --> 36:05.163
HELP! SOMEONE!
I'’M IN HERE!

36:14.259 --> 36:16.261
HELP! I'’M IN HERE!

36:16.304 --> 36:18.219
J.J.: STAY WITH US.
WE'’RE COMING IN. WHERE IS HE?

36:18.263 --> 36:21.135
I DON'’T KNOW.
SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE.

36:23.833 --> 36:25.052
GO, GO, GO!

36:30.840 --> 36:33.234
CHECKING ROOMS.

36:35.497 --> 36:37.456
HAVE MEDICAL STANDING BY.
ALL RIGHT.

36:37.499 --> 36:40.328
LET'’S GET HER OUT OF HERE.
THE HOUSE ISN'’T SECURE.

36:40.372 --> 36:42.330
I'’LL FINISH CHECKING
UPSTAIRS.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.746
