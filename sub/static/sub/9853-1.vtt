00:07.708 --> 00:10.041
( device beeping )

00:14.685 --> 00:16.117
Big day, Mom.

00:16.117 --> 00:19.690
- Harley, how'd you find me?
- Mom-tracker.

00:19.690 --> 00:21.322
Same way I found you
yesterday behind the dryer.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.954
Your inventions
are killing me, kid.

00:23.954 --> 00:25.226
( dripping )

00:25.226 --> 00:27.498
Oh, come on. Who left
the jelly open?

00:27.498 --> 00:28.929
It's in my hair.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.162
Yep, that's my mom.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.365
Squatting on
a can of corn in the closet.

00:34.365 --> 00:36.367
When you have seven kids
and want some peace,

00:36.367 --> 00:38.139
this is what happens.

00:38.139 --> 00:41.212
I need two more minutes
to slug down my coffee.

00:41.212 --> 00:42.573
Close the door before
the other kids see
and start buggin' me.

00:42.573 --> 00:45.516
Love it, respect it,
can't do it.

00:45.516 --> 00:47.948
The whole family has to be
at the park by 11:00

00:47.948 --> 00:49.550
for something great.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.082
Where's your travel mug?

00:51.082 --> 00:52.753
Not sure.
You got a mug tracker?

00:52.753 --> 00:54.725
Better.

00:54.725 --> 00:57.288
I'm the middle kid,

00:57.288 --> 00:59.230
so it's
hand-me-down city.

00:59.230 --> 01:02.663
I've gotten good at
working with what I've got.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.265
I'm not bragging.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.097
Being creative
isn't a choice.

01:06.097 --> 01:07.338
It's survival.

01:07.338 --> 01:09.840
Enjoy your new
travel thumb.

01:12.743 --> 01:15.676
Hazelnut and dish soap.
Weirdly, it works.

01:15.676 --> 01:19.180
Good, 'cause we gots to
get this party started.

01:19.180 --> 01:23.184
Doughnuts!
( voice echoing )

01:30.861 --> 01:32.823
Doughnuts!

01:32.823 --> 01:35.065
( all yelling )

01:39.230 --> 01:41.132
It's either an earthquake
or my family.

01:41.132 --> 01:43.033
( yelling continues )

01:43.033 --> 01:44.705
That's my family.

01:46.877 --> 01:48.879
Doughnuts, woman.
Where?

01:48.879 --> 01:51.111
( all talking at once )

01:51.111 --> 01:52.683
Calm down, people.

01:52.683 --> 01:55.686
Everyone's gonna get
doughnuts...

01:55.686 --> 01:57.017
when we get to the park
at 11:00.

01:57.017 --> 02:00.020
- Oh!
- What?!

02:01.922 --> 02:04.054
You are lucky
we're family,

02:04.054 --> 02:05.556
or I'd hurt you.

02:05.556 --> 02:06.797
Hurt me at the park.

02:10.161 --> 02:12.263
The park at 11:00?

02:12.263 --> 02:14.765
Let's see what
the big board says.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.469
Cooking class,
Beast and Lewie.

02:18.469 --> 02:20.140
Basketball game,
Georgie.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.243
Rachel, volunteer
at the soup kitchen.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.515
Harley, honey,
your magnet's not
even on here.

02:24.515 --> 02:26.547
It was there yesterday.

02:30.181 --> 02:32.353
Seriously?

02:32.353 --> 02:35.125
I was under the fridge
and no one even noticed.

02:35.125 --> 02:37.458
Hate to say it,
but unless you found
a dozen doughnuts,

02:37.458 --> 02:40.060
you're not gonna get
a lot of sympathy
from this crowd.

02:40.060 --> 02:43.894
I'm sorry, sweetie,
but we just can't
squeeze in the park today.

02:46.337 --> 02:49.270
This is what happens
when there's seven kids,

02:49.270 --> 02:51.141
and you're stuck
in the middle.

02:51.141 --> 02:53.874
If my family was a week,
I'd be Wednesday.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.546
Not the beginning
of the week

02:55.546 --> 02:59.049
where everyone's
full of energy and hope.

02:59.049 --> 03:00.711
That'd be Rachel...

03:00.711 --> 03:03.654
Ethan...
and Georgie.

03:03.654 --> 03:06.257
Yes, officer,
she yelled, "Doughnuts,"

03:06.257 --> 03:08.459
but there are
no doughnuts.

03:08.459 --> 03:10.921
Can you at least pretend
to arrest her?

03:10.921 --> 03:12.793
Hello.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.865
I'm not the end of the week,

03:14.865 --> 03:16.967
where they're
relieved and happy.

03:16.967 --> 03:21.402
That's Lewie, Beast,
and Daphne.

03:21.402 --> 03:24.174
I'm the day people
muddle through as best they can.

03:24.174 --> 03:25.836
Hump day.

03:25.836 --> 03:27.678
I'm Hump Day Harley.

03:27.678 --> 03:30.441
No name changes.
I can barely remember
the ones we gave you.

03:30.441 --> 03:32.283
( glass shattering )

03:32.283 --> 03:33.814
KIDS:
Wasn't me!

03:33.814 --> 03:35.986
Welcome to
the Diaz family.

03:35.986 --> 03:38.419
- Hide your breakables.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.790
Actually, just hide.

Ah, Harls, I'm really
sorry we can't make it

03:53.364 --> 03:54.535
to the park today.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.206
It's hard to
take you seriously

03:56.206 --> 03:57.408
when you're sucking
on a thumb.

03:57.408 --> 03:59.740
Sorry.

So what was going on?
Was it important?

Then we are gonna
make this work.

04:19.329 --> 04:22.262
Sorry, Lewie and Beast,
no cooking class today.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.794
What's the point?

04:23.794 --> 04:25.936
Yesterday I saw them
steal pizza crust
from a pigeon.

04:25.936 --> 04:28.299
All right,
we can make it.

04:28.299 --> 04:30.270
If we hit
every green light,

04:30.270 --> 04:32.343
we can get from
basketball to
the soup kitchen

04:32.343 --> 04:35.075
to the park with
three minutes to spare.
Now comes the hard part.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.276
BOTH: Getting nine people
out of the house.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.479
I'll go round
everybody up.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.110
- Permission to knock
some heads?
- Denied.

04:40.110 --> 04:43.884
I wish I could find someone
to do the ninja challenge.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.386
Sadly, you're not
old enough.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.588
Hello. We're twins.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.821
Hello. I was born
90 seconds before you.

04:50.821 --> 04:53.223
So you'll always be
90 seconds behind,

04:53.223 --> 04:55.596
which means you're not
ready for the ninja challenge.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.968
Ninja challenge?
I'll kill it.

04:57.968 --> 05:00.531
I'll bite its head off,
step on it,

05:00.531 --> 05:04.335
and eat it.
I just ate it.

05:04.335 --> 05:06.777
What's the ninja challenge?

05:06.777 --> 05:08.909
You have to go around
the whole day

05:08.909 --> 05:11.742
without letting your feet
touch the ground.

05:11.742 --> 05:13.113
It's impossible.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.715
Says you.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.918
It's on.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.390
Ninja!!

05:19.390 --> 05:21.452
Your foot's in
a tub of margarine.

05:23.794 --> 05:25.556
Not a strong start, ninja.

05:25.556 --> 05:28.999
Guys, wait until breakfast
to put your feet in the food.

05:28.999 --> 05:31.462
Let's push the tables together
so we can eat.

05:31.462 --> 05:33.504
Cereal assembly line!

05:33.504 --> 05:35.866
HARLEY: This is how
my family eats.

05:35.866 --> 05:38.669
Divide, conquer, score.

05:38.669 --> 05:40.541
And this is where
my family eats.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.743
A real table,
a card table,

05:42.743 --> 05:46.547
and something I'm pretty sure
used to be a nightstand.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.520
Mom bought the real table
when they had two kids.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.351
But then they had
five more,

05:51.351 --> 05:53.353
and no time for
furniture shopping,

05:53.353 --> 05:55.325
so welcome to
the bacon-free zone.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.961
Beast put that
up his nose.

06:00.961 --> 06:05.496
Thanks for mentioning it
after I had my teeth on it.

06:05.496 --> 06:07.197
Hey, guys, gotta go.

06:07.197 --> 06:09.069

Get up now and I'll do
your chores for a week.

06:11.702 --> 06:14.044
( clamoring )

06:17.247 --> 06:19.650
Rachel.
Three-minute limit.

06:19.650 --> 06:21.482
You've been in there
for 20.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.415
In a big family,
you need rules.

06:24.415 --> 06:26.687
We all get
three minutes.

06:26.687 --> 06:30.120
You have to do number one and
number two in less than three.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.693
That's bad math.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.995
I'm literally
the only one in this family

06:34.995 --> 06:36.727
who consistently
looks hot,

06:36.727 --> 06:38.228
so maybe don't
hassle the one

06:38.228 --> 06:39.530
who's bringing it
on the regular.

06:39.530 --> 06:41.401
You're going
to feed the homeless.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.734
The only hot thing
they want is lunch.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.438
I'm not scared of you,

06:47.438 --> 06:49.580
or Dad's old flip phone
that you blinged out.

06:49.580 --> 06:50.741
It doesn't even work.

06:50.741 --> 06:52.412
The clock does,

06:52.412 --> 06:54.144
and so does the camera.

06:54.144 --> 06:55.946
Two seconds before
I'm all up in there

06:55.946 --> 06:57.417
updating your
profile photo.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.149
This is a violation.

06:59.149 --> 07:01.652
Kendall and Kylie would
never do this to Kim.

07:01.652 --> 07:04.224
Really? The list of what
the Kardashians won't do

07:04.224 --> 07:05.796
is pretty short.

07:05.796 --> 07:06.897
( frustrated grunt )

07:08.198 --> 07:10.631
I'm behind schedule.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.063
I'm gonna need an assist
from my BFTF.

07:13.063 --> 07:14.605
Best friend
in the family,

07:14.605 --> 07:16.667
which is even better
than a BFF,

07:16.667 --> 07:18.609
because he's stuck with me
no matter what,

07:18.609 --> 07:20.671
until the end of time.

07:20.671 --> 07:24.515
That came out evil,
but it's actually really cool.

07:24.515 --> 07:27.478
Ethan, I need you to...

07:27.478 --> 07:30.050
- What's with the walking
lint ball?
- It's Jermaine.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.553
My friend's on vacation,
so I'm watching his hamster.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.955
I'm training Jermaine
to be my wingman.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.529
Girls come for the pet,
and stay for the song.

07:38.529 --> 07:43.864
♪ I need your love
to keep me sane ♪

07:43.864 --> 07:47.568
♪ Cruise into town
with my wingman Jermaine ♪

07:47.568 --> 07:52.442
Yeah, no pet's making
anyone stay for that song.

07:52.442 --> 07:54.645
And are you concerned
your wingman just ate
his own poop?

07:54.645 --> 07:56.547
It's a concern, yes.

07:56.547 --> 07:59.550
I need you to help me get
everyone out the door

07:59.550 --> 08:03.413
Look, I get it.
I'm the middle kid.

08:03.413 --> 08:06.717
I didn't mind that
I had to toilet train myself
in a potted fern.

08:06.717 --> 08:09.089
The only watering
that plant ever got.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.492
But I invented
something really cool.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.695
Maybe the coolest thing
I've ever done.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.768
And I'm getting
an award for it
at the park at 11:00.

08:17.768 --> 08:19.029
Congrats, sis.
What is it?

08:19.029 --> 08:20.931
Can't say.

08:20.931 --> 08:22.903
It's a surprise
for the whole family,

08:22.903 --> 08:26.977
and I want everybody
to see it together.

08:26.977 --> 08:29.009
Ethan.

08:29.009 --> 08:33.583
I've never asked before,
and I know it will never
happen again.

08:33.583 --> 08:36.416
But it's super important
that today is the one day

08:36.416 --> 08:38.347
where the whole family
shows up for me.

08:38.347 --> 08:41.351
Look, you know
you're my BFTF,

08:41.351 --> 08:43.323
and I'd do
anything for you.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.696
But this family
in one place, on time?

08:45.696 --> 08:47.758
Oof.

08:47.758 --> 08:50.701

08:50.701 --> 08:52.532
Two-minute warning.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.064
It's about to go down.

08:54.064 --> 08:55.806

park by 11:00.

08:55.806 --> 08:57.738
Hold onto your furball.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.539
Gonna be
a people stampede.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.072
Everybody ready to go?

09:02.072 --> 09:03.644
ALL: No!!

09:03.644 --> 09:05.646
Doughnuts!

09:05.646 --> 09:08.448
ALL: Yeah, right!

09:08.448 --> 09:10.480
If it makes you
feel any better,

09:10.480 --> 09:11.652
I think Jermaine
bought it.

09:19.089 --> 09:22.593
Hey, guys, got your shoes
locked and loaded.

09:22.593 --> 09:25.796
We're gonna totally
get to the park on time. Yeah!

09:25.796 --> 09:29.099
Wow, that sounded
way more confident than I feel.

09:31.902 --> 09:33.604
Good hustle, Georgie.

09:33.604 --> 09:35.005
We got one minute to be
out the door to your game,

09:35.005 --> 09:36.446
so step in, let's go.

09:36.446 --> 09:38.178
Yeah, gonna win
this thing today.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.810
Success isn't given,
it's earned.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.451
Earn it, Georgie,
earn it.

09:41.451 --> 09:44.114
Whoever you're talking to,
we don't have time.

09:44.114 --> 09:46.687
Self-talk is a key
strategy for enhanced
physical performance.

09:46.687 --> 09:49.319
Say it with me, Harley.
Self-talk is a key--

09:49.319 --> 09:51.692
- I am not--
- Say it!

09:51.692 --> 09:53.593
BOTH: Self-talk

09:53.593 --> 09:55.195
Like you mean it.

BOTH: ...for enhanced
physical performance.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.129
You know, Georgie,
you do this before every game,

09:59.129 --> 10:00.771
and I'm not sure
it's working.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.175

Does that count?

10:05.175 --> 10:06.606
Your team
never wins.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.179
Negativity is
loser fuel, my friend.

10:09.179 --> 10:12.442
I need to sweat out
the negativity you just
brought into my zone.

10:12.442 --> 10:14.184
- Jump with me, Harley.
- I am not--

10:14.184 --> 10:15.716
Jump!

10:17.818 --> 10:20.490
All right, jump it
on out to the car.

10:23.553 --> 10:24.995
Comin' through.

10:24.995 --> 10:27.427
Ninja!

10:31.932 --> 10:34.004
No.

10:34.004 --> 10:36.136
The soup kitchen will not
be serving butt cheeks today.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.039
When you have
a sister like Rachel,

10:39.039 --> 10:41.141
you can count on
at least one outfit

10:41.141 --> 10:44.644
your parents will veto every
time you try to leave the house,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.616
which is why
I came prepared.

10:46.616 --> 10:48.318
Leggings.

10:48.318 --> 10:50.781
Ugh!

10:50.781 --> 10:52.382
I literally just
glitter-lotioned my legs

10:52.382 --> 10:53.623
for my boo.

10:53.623 --> 10:55.786
Cuff loves sparkles.

10:55.786 --> 10:58.088
Cuff's gonna be there?
No, I don't trust
that kid.

10:58.088 --> 11:00.430
And not just because
he said "Trust me,"
and winked.

11:00.430 --> 11:03.463
Sorry, Dad, no time for
the Papa Bear routine today.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.066
But I love that you think
Cuff's the problem.

11:07.838 --> 11:10.470
( clamoring )

11:10.470 --> 11:12.672
HARLEY: Middle kid
means middle seat,

11:12.672 --> 11:14.845
which is awesome if you like
to ride with fingers,

11:14.845 --> 11:16.847
elbows and pets
in your mouth.

11:16.847 --> 11:19.509
What is the point of beeping
inside the van

11:19.509 --> 11:22.212
if it's a safety warning
for people outside?

11:22.212 --> 11:24.254
It doesn't make sense.
Is it just me?

11:24.254 --> 11:25.916
( gasps )
Hang on.

11:25.916 --> 11:27.687
I just remembered.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.889
I'm supposed to bring
the team snack.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.090
I got it.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.792
I saw this coming, Mom.
No offense.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.324
Please. I'm touched
you know me so well.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.869
Bethany. I didn't
see you there.

11:38.869 --> 11:41.071
With all the ruckus,
I thought your family

11:41.071 --> 11:44.004
was chasing away
a pack of wild bears.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.175
I wish I had
a big family.

11:45.175 --> 11:47.037
Or a brother.

11:47.037 --> 11:49.840
Or a sister.
Or even a fish.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.283
You have fish every night
for dinner. Broiled.

11:53.283 --> 11:55.085
Here. I found this
in our yard.

11:55.085 --> 11:57.187
It's one of the few not already
stuck in your rain gutter.

11:58.849 --> 12:02.322
Been meaning to
clean that out,
five kids ago.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.826
I know you don't have time
to read parenting books...

12:05.826 --> 12:07.798
or parent...

12:07.798 --> 12:10.330
but a recent study showed
children raised in chaos

12:10.330 --> 12:12.162
end up in jail.

12:12.162 --> 12:14.935
Not a problem.
All our kids look
great in orange.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.908
Good chat.
Hit the gas.

12:17.908 --> 12:20.470
If we leave now, we'll still
be at the park by 11:00,

12:20.470 --> 12:23.613
right after Georgie
loses in a quick blowout.

12:25.615 --> 12:27.978
So much for
the blowout strategy.

12:27.978 --> 12:31.321
It's almost time.
We don't have time for overtime.

12:31.321 --> 12:34.284
It's B-ball, soup kitchen,
park by 11:00.

12:34.284 --> 12:37.788
They've been a different team
since snack break.

12:37.788 --> 12:39.890
Uh...

12:39.890 --> 12:42.833
Harls, what were those
granola bars you gave them?

12:42.833 --> 12:45.365
- Just these.
- You Go Girl bars?!

12:45.365 --> 12:48.538
I got those the week
you all had strep,
and I was exhausted.

12:48.538 --> 12:51.241
One bar, and I was
up all night making
that activity board,

12:51.241 --> 12:53.103
which, frankly,
does not work.

12:53.103 --> 12:54.875
I threw those bars away.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.576
Hate to tell you,
but it's not the first time

12:56.576 --> 12:58.708
one of your kids
ate out of the trash.

12:58.708 --> 13:01.411
Well, if the other parents ask,
I'm gonna have to be honest.

13:01.411 --> 13:04.684
Hide 'em, hide
'em, hide 'em.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.263
What are you doing?

13:13.263 --> 13:15.525
He's trying to get
snacks from the
concession stand

13:15.525 --> 13:17.227
without touching
the ground.

13:17.227 --> 13:19.199
I'm trying to swing him
into a wall and knock him off.

13:19.199 --> 13:22.132
Wall, wall.

13:22.132 --> 13:23.733
Dang, he missed.

13:25.635 --> 13:26.806
Want anything?

13:26.806 --> 13:27.978
I'll take a giant pretzel.

13:27.978 --> 13:29.339
Hold this.

13:32.342 --> 13:34.344
Wall, wall.

13:34.344 --> 13:38.348
Come on, that should've put
his ninja butt in the ER.

13:38.348 --> 13:41.221
No, Rachel.
This is not the plan.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.493
You need to go back to
the homeless shelter

13:43.493 --> 13:45.455
where you belong.

13:47.197 --> 13:48.798
It's her sister.

13:48.798 --> 13:50.200
She's not homeless.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.801
She's clueless,
but not homeless.

13:51.801 --> 13:53.333
The homeless
were super nice,

13:53.333 --> 13:55.205
and they literally
loved my outfit.

13:55.205 --> 13:58.308
But we served chili,
which made my hair
smell like chili.

13:58.308 --> 14:01.611
I almost threw up
in a bag of gently used
clothing donations.

14:01.611 --> 14:03.673
Cuff took me home.
We're getting a snack.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.877
Hot, hot!

14:06.877 --> 14:08.718
Oh, man!

14:08.718 --> 14:10.780
Couch ate my pizza.

14:10.780 --> 14:12.923
We gotta re-snack.

14:16.086 --> 14:17.928
No, sir.
No snacks.

14:17.928 --> 14:20.090
That is a slippery slope,
and I know the snack slope.

14:20.090 --> 14:21.491
Rachel, I want him out.

14:21.491 --> 14:23.463
We'll circle back for you
on the way to the park.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.765
Home is out of our way.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.867
I can't believe
Rachel's so selfish.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.399
New to this family,
are ya?

14:31.041 --> 14:33.073
Come on, Georgie.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.705
Let's go, Terriers!

14:35.705 --> 14:37.107
My day's falling apart

14:37.107 --> 14:40.550
quicker than that edible
jungle gym I invented.

14:40.550 --> 14:42.252
You're not kidding.

14:42.252 --> 14:44.414
This game's tied
and the clock's running out.

14:44.414 --> 14:46.987
If it goes to overtime,
you'll never get to the park.

14:52.923 --> 14:54.925
You're right.

14:57.097 --> 15:00.470
I give up.

15:00.470 --> 15:02.502
It's the most important
day of my life,

15:02.502 --> 15:03.803
and no one even cares.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.575
I just have
to accept that

15:05.575 --> 15:08.738
I don't matter
in this family, Ethan.

15:08.738 --> 15:10.240
I'm Wednesday.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.043
Of course
you're Wednesday.

15:13.043 --> 15:14.985
Middle of the week.
Everyone knows that.

15:14.985 --> 15:16.947
Was that supposed
to be a pep talk?

15:16.947 --> 15:19.019
Yes.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.151
Mom needs snacks,
you're on it.

15:21.151 --> 15:23.223
Rachel needs tights.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.754
You're on it.

15:24.754 --> 15:26.556
A broken doll
headed for the trash.

15:26.556 --> 15:28.328
You make it into
something cool.

15:28.328 --> 15:32.132
Anyone can make a rag doll
into a spray cheese squirt gun.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.134
No, they can't.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.905
Cheddar Shirley
was genius.

15:35.905 --> 15:37.937
Snacks, tights, toys.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.910
You're the glue
of this family,

15:40.910 --> 15:43.313
just like Wednesday's
the glue of the week.

15:43.313 --> 15:45.675
Wednesday holds
the week together.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.953
Thanks, bro.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.485
We are getting to
the park on time.

15:55.485 --> 15:57.527
Georgie's team just needs
to make a basket

15:57.527 --> 15:58.928
to break the tie
and we're out of here.

16:02.062 --> 16:05.095
Oh, not Georgie.
She's not breaking any tie.

16:05.095 --> 16:06.766
She never even scored.

16:06.766 --> 16:10.300
Jermaine, you're not
the only one about to eat poop.

16:15.205 --> 16:17.077
The only chance to win
the game is for Georgie
to have a clear shot.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.180
Clear shot?
How's that gonna happen?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.182
Georgie needs a wingman.

16:24.054 --> 16:26.286
Spit out that poop, Jermaine.
You're goin' in.

Georgie.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.874
Somebody catch me.
I'm divin'!

17:26.246 --> 17:27.977
( all groaning )

17:27.977 --> 17:31.151
My bad. Should've
given more warning.

17:32.952 --> 17:35.155
( car beeping )

17:35.155 --> 17:37.327
Get in. We have eight minutes
to get to the park.

17:37.327 --> 17:41.060
I've got Cheddar Shirley,
and I'm not afraid to use her.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.062
Say cheese, Shirley.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.739
Oh, forget it. I already ate
the cookie stash under there.

17:49.739 --> 17:52.502
I'm de-beeping
the beeper.

17:52.502 --> 17:55.074
Of all the things
shouting at me in the van,

17:55.074 --> 17:58.278
this is the one
that I can stop.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.049
( no beeping )

18:01.881 --> 18:03.753
Silence. Yes!

18:03.753 --> 18:06.156
Beep you, beeper.

18:06.156 --> 18:07.457
Gah!

18:07.457 --> 18:09.889
Bethany, seriously,
do you teleport here?

18:09.889 --> 18:11.761
Exciting game, huh?

18:11.761 --> 18:13.893
Oh, yes, I really enjoy
seeing my daughter's head

18:13.893 --> 18:16.266
used as a backboard.

18:16.266 --> 18:19.269
That reverse beeper
is an important safety feature.

18:19.269 --> 18:21.831
I'm not disabling the feature
that warns people outside.

18:21.831 --> 18:23.173
I know that
I'm in reverse.

18:23.173 --> 18:24.834
How? Because I just
put it there.

18:24.834 --> 18:26.706
I don't know how you can
hear anything

18:26.706 --> 18:30.140
over that population explosion
happening in your car.

18:30.140 --> 18:31.941
You probably don't
recognize it,

18:31.941 --> 18:33.343
but this is
the sound of fun.

18:33.343 --> 18:36.546
We'd love to stay
and defend our life choices,

18:36.546 --> 18:38.748
but we all have
somewhere to be,

18:38.748 --> 18:40.390
somewhat on time.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.195
Heads up!

18:55.134 --> 18:57.106
( smirking )

18:57.106 --> 19:00.109
Well, well, well.

19:00.109 --> 19:02.942
Who saw that coming?
Me actually.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.715
I made it the "A" topic
at our neighborhood meeting.

19:05.715 --> 19:09.319
Topics "B" through "Z"
were also about your family.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.384
( groaning sound )

19:14.384 --> 19:16.155
BOTH: No!!

19:27.096 --> 19:28.838
( growling )

19:31.341 --> 19:34.374
Welcome to the moment where
my hope for getting to the park

19:34.374 --> 19:36.206
officially died.

19:36.206 --> 19:37.877
Hey, guys, gotta go.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.880
All I wanted was one day
to show I mattered,

19:40.880 --> 19:44.484
but I had it twisted.
Doughnuts!

19:44.484 --> 19:46.786
I'm the one that keeps
this family from being

19:46.786 --> 19:48.458
a bunch of snackless...
I got it.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.890
naked...
Leggings.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.262
dolls with no heads.

19:52.262 --> 19:55.124
You're the glue
of this family,

19:55.124 --> 19:57.367
just like Wednesday's
the glue of the week.

19:57.367 --> 20:00.600
Turns out I didn't need
one day.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.702
I matter every day.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.407
BETHANY: No. Back!

20:07.407 --> 20:08.438
You've done enough.

20:13.543 --> 20:15.685
No, no, no.
Stop it.

20:15.685 --> 20:19.249
Stop it. We will not sit here
and laugh at Miss Peters.

20:21.451 --> 20:23.623
We will laugh
at the park.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.297
Because we promised Harley.

20:27.297 --> 20:29.299
It's okay, Dad.
You don't have to.

20:29.299 --> 20:31.160
Yes, I do.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.802
Because there's only
one time

20:32.802 --> 20:36.266
that I am not happy
to have seven kids,

20:36.266 --> 20:37.837
and that is when
I let one of them down.

20:39.269 --> 20:42.171
So look out, park.
Here we come.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.983
I'd like to thank
the Young Inventors Club

20:53.983 --> 20:56.155
for giving me first place
in the design challenge.

20:56.155 --> 20:58.257
( feedback whines )

20:58.257 --> 21:02.562
It's so cool you guys
built this for my idea.

21:02.562 --> 21:06.095
I would also like to thank
my family.

21:06.095 --> 21:08.738
Without you, I wouldn't
have the inspiration

21:08.738 --> 21:11.301
to create the solution
for big families.

21:11.301 --> 21:13.573
Thank you.

21:16.946 --> 21:20.049
I'm so sorry we missed
the awards, sweetie,

21:20.049 --> 21:22.051
but Dad and I
couldn't be prouder.

21:22.051 --> 21:23.853
What an amazing idea
you thought of.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.388
Yeah, it's all right.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.861
Wait.

21:31.861 --> 21:35.024
She jerked us around
all day for a table?

21:35.024 --> 21:36.295
A table?!

21:36.295 --> 21:38.368
This isn't
just a table.

21:38.368 --> 21:40.730
I designed it for
big families like ours.

21:40.730 --> 21:43.733
I love you guys,
but I also love bacon.

21:43.733 --> 21:46.406
With this table,
everyone gets some.

21:48.838 --> 21:50.980
DAD: Wow, look at it
spin around!

21:50.980 --> 21:52.812
Tired of fighting
over condiments?

21:52.812 --> 21:56.045
Built-in syrup and ketchup
dispensers.

21:56.045 --> 21:59.018
( all exclaiming )

21:59.018 --> 22:01.951
Want milk in your glass
and not your pants?

22:01.951 --> 22:04.153
Retractable cup holders.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.798
Oh, that's awesome!

22:08.798 --> 22:10.930
Plus, chairs for everyone.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.633
DAD: Whoa,
great idea, huh?

22:13.633 --> 22:15.635
Okay, folks,
bring it in.

22:15.635 --> 22:16.906
Let's see what
this family looks like

22:16.906 --> 22:18.708
sitting at one table.

22:22.171 --> 22:23.543
Hey, look.

22:23.543 --> 22:26.175
Apparently it wouldn't be
the first time

22:26.175 --> 22:29.078
our kids ate something
out of the trash.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.028
Doughnuts!

22:50.169 --> 22:53.072
We may be eating
garbage doughnuts,

22:53.072 --> 22:56.075
but I love
our big family.

22:56.075 --> 22:59.849
Yeah, sometimes
they're not so bad.

23:02.311 --> 23:03.413
Beast!

23:03.413 --> 23:04.984
I'm good.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.086
Landed on my back,
not my feet.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.819
