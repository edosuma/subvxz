♪♪

00:05.580 --> 00:07.500
- Previously...
- Okay, folks,
this is a big one.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.960
We just received intel
that enemy agents

00:09.960 --> 00:12.420
are hiding right here
in the D.C. Metro area,

00:12.420 --> 00:14.750
pretending to be
ordinary citizens.

00:14.750 --> 00:16.710
[Ernie] This can't be
the right location.

00:16.710 --> 00:18.880
It's practically around
the corner from our house.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.290
- That would mean...
- Enemy agents have been
living in our own neighborhood.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.960
I am not spying
on Amy.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.710
Just buddy up to her,
get into her house,

00:25.710 --> 00:28.120
and find that weapons
distribution list.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.330
We can take down every
enemy spy network
in the country.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.540
Thousands of lives
could be saved.

00:32.540 --> 00:34.040
[KC] I'll do it.

00:37.290 --> 00:40.710
Okay, is it just me,
or does it feel like
we've been friends forever?

00:40.710 --> 00:42.670
I know, I know,
it's kinda crazy.

00:42.670 --> 00:44.500
We love
all the same stuff.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.040
All right, well,
I don't know about that.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.330
Okay, let's see.

00:47.330 --> 00:49.460
How about I name some of
the things I love,

00:49.460 --> 00:50.670
and we'll see if
you love it too.

00:50.670 --> 00:53.880
- Cool. Let's do it.
- Okay, bagpipe music.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.830
Uh, yeah. Is there
a better bag instrument?

00:57.830 --> 00:59.420
Okay, how about
renaissance fairs?

00:59.420 --> 01:03.170
Thou hast declareth
the truth about mine self,

01:03.170 --> 01:06.790
'cause I, too, loveth
the ren fair.

01:06.790 --> 01:08.620
Buzzumba workouts.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.540
I don't love buzzumba.

01:10.540 --> 01:12.380
I love, love,
love buzzumba!

01:12.380 --> 01:14.170
Okay, well, then,

01:14.170 --> 01:16.000
why don't we hit up
a class after school?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.710
I just took one
this morning,

01:17.710 --> 01:21.710
but hey, double the buzzumba,
double the fun... ba.

01:23.330 --> 01:25.170
Oh. Man.

01:25.170 --> 01:26.580
I'm so sorry.
Did you want a bite?

01:26.580 --> 01:29.380
Oh, no, I'm good.
I'm actually a vegetarian, so...

01:29.380 --> 01:30.670
You won't be
after you eat me.

01:30.670 --> 01:32.580
Come on, take a bite.

01:32.580 --> 01:34.540
It's really good,
it's really good.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.120
Really, I can't.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.330
Okay, that's fine.

01:38.330 --> 01:39.710
I guess we don't love
all the same things.

01:39.710 --> 01:42.170
You didn't let me finish.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.920
What I mean is,
I can't...

01:43.920 --> 01:47.250
wait to take a bite...

01:47.250 --> 01:49.710
out of that big,

01:49.710 --> 01:53.500
juicy, meaty burger.
Right?

01:57.210 --> 01:59.620
There's bacon in there.
That's nice.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.080
Hold it.
I gotta hit the library.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.620
You wanna meet me there?

02:03.620 --> 02:05.500
See you there.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.790
Gotta finish this burger.

02:08.750 --> 02:11.000
[coughing]

02:11.000 --> 02:13.540
Am I crazy, or do you
spend all of your time
with Amy?

02:13.540 --> 02:15.620
Marisa, you know that
this is my assignment, okay?

02:15.620 --> 02:17.620
I have to pretend
to be her friend

02:17.620 --> 02:19.790
so I can get into
her house and plant
some bugs.

02:19.790 --> 02:21.170
Is she a spy or not?

02:21.170 --> 02:23.500
I don't know,
but I know she's annoying.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.580
I mean, please, can you
just hang out with us,

02:26.580 --> 02:31.080
'cause I need a buffer
between me and the buzzumba
dancing bagpipe enthusiast.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.580
Yeah, sure. Just name
the time and place.

02:32.580 --> 02:35.290
Actually, right now.
I'm supposed to meet her
in the library; wanna come?

02:35.290 --> 02:37.790
Okay, yeah, cool.
Uh, the library's
this way, right?

02:37.790 --> 02:39.960
What, no. The library's
always been this way.

[groaning]

03:52.170 --> 03:53.880
Whoo!

03:55.960 --> 03:57.500
Isn't this
a great class?

03:57.500 --> 03:58.670
Oh, it's great.
I just wish it was

03:58.670 --> 04:00.580
a little more
challenging.

04:00.580 --> 04:02.540
- I barely broke a sweat.
- You look pretty
sweaty to me.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.380
Oh, this? No.

04:04.380 --> 04:05.920
This is just
my pre-sweat sweat.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.170
I haven't gotten to
the real salty sweat yet.

04:09.170 --> 04:12.000
Right, well, I'm gonna
go fill my water bottle
for the second half.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.750
Oh, great.
Second half. Right.

04:13.750 --> 04:14.920
Kill me now.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.540
I'm just gonna
take a seat.

04:19.540 --> 04:22.750
No seats. Okay, well,
I'll lean.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.790
I'm just gonna
full-out collapse.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.460
Are you okay?

04:31.460 --> 04:33.330
Yeah. Oh, no,
I'm good.

04:33.330 --> 04:35.000
I was just, um,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.120
doing my full body
floor stretch.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.750
Ready for
the second half.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.960
While we're
stretching it out,

04:41.960 --> 04:45.670
maybe we could think of
some things we could
do with Marisa.

04:45.670 --> 04:47.920
Oh, this is awkward.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.380
- What?
- I know you're
close with her,

04:50.380 --> 04:53.670
but I just find Marisa
a teeny, tiny, little bit,

04:53.670 --> 04:56.960
wildly, crazy,
overly dramatic.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.710
Oh, no, Marisa is
so much more than that.

04:59.710 --> 05:02.210
She's, um...

05:02.210 --> 05:04.250
oblivious, flaky,
and self-centered,

05:04.250 --> 05:06.670
but that's what
makes it so fun.

05:06.670 --> 05:08.250
Sorry.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.790
I just like people
like us.

05:09.790 --> 05:11.080
Really chill.

05:12.250 --> 05:16.080
Whoo! Buzzumba!
Yes!

05:16.080 --> 05:17.710
What are you doing?

05:17.710 --> 05:20.080
Just chillin', right?

05:20.080 --> 05:21.710
Chillin'.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.790
Wow, that buzzumba
class was great.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.500
Too bad they had
to cut it short, right?

05:28.500 --> 05:30.710
After you kicked in
the sound system,

05:30.710 --> 05:32.000
it was a little hard
to keep going.

05:33.670 --> 05:36.040
Speaking of which,
I have to pee again.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.960
Second time in
two minutes.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.620
It's okay. When you gotta
go, you gotta go.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.000
Especially when I put
a little something extra

05:41.000 --> 05:43.500
in your drink.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.210
Okay, Ernie, I'm gonna start
placing the surveillance bugs.

05:49.620 --> 05:52.620
Okay, I'm picking up
video and sound.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.830
Yay! Now we get to monitor
all their conversations.

05:55.830 --> 05:57.710
Let the boredom begin.

05:59.250 --> 06:01.460
Hey, guys, I think I found
what seems to be

06:01.460 --> 06:03.460
a military-grade
laptop.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.330
And considering nobody
in that household is
in the military,

06:06.330 --> 06:09.330
this could be our link
to the arms distribution list.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.170
Hey, sorry I keep
going to the bathroom.

06:13.170 --> 06:14.670
I don't know why I keep
having to pee.

06:14.670 --> 06:16.380
It's all good.

06:16.380 --> 06:18.540
Better you do it
in there than out
here, right?

06:18.540 --> 06:20.750
Um, hey, I was actually
trying to check my email
on my phone,

06:20.750 --> 06:22.380
but I wasn't getting
any signal.

06:22.380 --> 06:23.790
Can I just use
this computer?

06:23.790 --> 06:25.960
No, no, you can't
use that.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.540
Why not?

06:27.540 --> 06:29.040
I promise I won't
check your search history

06:29.040 --> 06:30.710
and get all judge-y.

06:30.710 --> 06:32.670
What I mean is,

06:32.670 --> 06:34.670
this is my parents'
work computer,

06:34.670 --> 06:36.000
and they'll freak out
if you do...

06:36.000 --> 06:37.750
Oh, I have to pee again.

06:45.790 --> 06:47.290
Oh, great,
it's password protected.

06:47.290 --> 06:48.790
[Judy] Okay, try this.

06:48.790 --> 06:50.710
Okay, I'm ready.
Go ahead.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.120
- Y.
- Y.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.790
- R.
- R.

06:53.790 --> 06:55.460
- U.
- U.

06:55.460 --> 06:56.750
So stupid?

06:58.750 --> 07:00.920
A laptop containing
all the information

07:00.920 --> 07:02.710
that will help us
shut down

07:02.710 --> 07:04.210
every enemy spy
network in the world.

07:04.210 --> 07:06.210
Of course it's
password protected!

07:10.960 --> 07:13.790
So what's your take on Amy?
Is she in this or not?

07:13.790 --> 07:15.120
My gut instinct
is telling me

07:15.120 --> 07:16.580
she's definitely a spy,

07:16.580 --> 07:18.460
starting with
her actual gut.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.460
That girl is in
top physical condition,

07:20.460 --> 07:22.040
much more than
the average teenager.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.000
That tells me she may have
had some training.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.250
She almost tried to
eliminate someone today.

07:26.250 --> 07:27.790
- Who?
- Me.

07:27.790 --> 07:29.170
Yeah, that buzzumba class
almost killed me.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.830
Plus, when I asked her
about the computer,

07:32.830 --> 07:35.210
she got really weird,
like scared almost.

07:35.210 --> 07:37.210
Well, you are
an excellent judge of character.

07:37.210 --> 07:38.960
Better than I was
at your age.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.960
Back in college, I dated
this guy named Gerald.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.960
Thought he was
the perfect boyfriend.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.580
Turns out he was dating
every girl in the dorm.

07:47.580 --> 07:50.420
You know what
I find interesting?

07:51.830 --> 07:53.830
When I met you,

07:53.830 --> 07:56.920
you told me you'd
only had one boyfriend.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.500
But now it seems like
every time you tell a story

07:58.500 --> 08:00.790
about the good old days,
you're with a different guy.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.580
Just how many boyfriends
did you have?

08:02.580 --> 08:06.250
Craig, don't ask questions
you don't want answers to.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.790
And besides, I'm not
the one under investigation.

08:07.790 --> 08:09.250
It's Amy.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.000
Judy and Ernie
are on surveillance,

08:11.000 --> 08:12.290
so hopefully they'll
have some information soon

08:12.290 --> 08:13.420
that helps get
into the computer.

08:13.420 --> 08:15.000
But for future reference,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.790
anything that happened
in the romantic arena

08:17.790 --> 08:19.040
before you two
were my parents,

08:19.040 --> 08:21.790
I don't need to know
about it.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.420
I'm just sayin'.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.880
Why does Mitch even bother
buying tissues

08:30.880 --> 08:32.790
if he insists on
picking a winner every time?

08:32.790 --> 08:34.290
Nasty.

08:34.290 --> 08:36.880
Mm-hmm.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.040
What do you guys
want for dinner?

08:38.040 --> 08:41.420
Oh, let's go to
that barbecue place downtown.

08:41.420 --> 08:43.420
I am two pork racks away

08:43.420 --> 08:45.580
from a free order
of mac and cheese.

08:45.580 --> 08:47.620
Not to mention
high cholesterol.

08:47.620 --> 08:49.420
Guys, that place
is so crowded.

08:49.420 --> 08:51.380
I don't wanna wait
two hours for a table.

08:51.380 --> 08:53.080
I'm with Amy.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.380
Yes, it's crowded because

08:54.380 --> 08:57.000
they have the best
Kansas City ribs

08:57.000 --> 08:59.080
outside of Kansas City.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.000
Come on, I want my ribs.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.290
Then go pick some up, Mitch.

09:03.290 --> 09:05.040
And wait in line
for two hours?

09:05.040 --> 09:07.880
- Nah, forget it.
- Pizza it is.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.460
They must know
they're bugged,

09:11.460 --> 09:13.670
and they're saying
really boring stuff
just to torture us.

09:13.670 --> 09:15.420
Hey, guys,
how's surveillance going?

09:15.420 --> 09:17.210
Do you have any information
on the Bishops

09:17.210 --> 09:18.330
that can help us
figure out the password?

09:18.330 --> 09:20.670
Nothing, unless
you count the fact

09:20.670 --> 09:22.830
that Mitch is obsessed
with Kansas City ribs.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.750
Kansas City ribs?

09:24.750 --> 09:27.330
Wait a minute.
Kansas City ribs.

09:27.330 --> 09:31.960
Hey, what if the best way
to a spy's password

09:31.960 --> 09:33.920
is through his stomach?

09:33.920 --> 09:37.290
So you're saying you want me
to rip out his stomach?

09:37.290 --> 09:39.460
No, I was talking
about ribs.

09:39.460 --> 09:42.040
Oh, I mean, I can
rip out his ribs, too.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.580
But I'm warning you,
it's going to be
a lot messier.

09:49.250 --> 09:52.460
Hey, so I came up
with a plan

09:52.460 --> 09:54.460
for you, me and Amy.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.500
Oh, about that.
Yeah, I don't really
think that's gonna work.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.750
It turns out she...
[mutters]

09:57.750 --> 10:00.040
I'm sorry, what?

10:00.040 --> 10:03.750
It turns out she, um...
doesn't really like you.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.880
What? Why?

10:05.880 --> 10:07.290
I don't know.
She just thinks

10:07.290 --> 10:08.960
that you're
a little overly dramatic.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.960
[loud gasp]

10:13.290 --> 10:15.170
Overly dramatic?

10:15.170 --> 10:17.960
Moi?
Moi?!

10:17.960 --> 10:20.500
That is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.120
Am I overly dramatic?
What a joke.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.120
What a joke.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.250
I'm universally adored.

10:27.250 --> 10:28.750
Adored!

10:30.540 --> 10:33.460
Yeah, I'm not really seeing
the overly dramatic thing.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.040
Okay, so that's it?
I can't hang out with you

10:35.040 --> 10:36.290
at all when you're
doing this mission?

10:36.290 --> 10:38.000
Look, I don't
like it either.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.290
Okay? Amy is getting
on my last nerve,

10:40.290 --> 10:42.420
and hopefully,
it will be over soon,

10:42.420 --> 10:44.000
because I came up
with a plan to get
into their computer.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.920
Fine, do what you
have to do to save the world

10:46.920 --> 10:48.880
while mine is
quietly collapsing.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.920
Well, that wasn't
dramatic at all.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.500
Marisa? What are you
doing here?

11:12.500 --> 11:15.040
Oh, hey, KC,
hey, Amy.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.540
I didn't know you guys
would be here.

11:16.540 --> 11:19.040
I just came for
my Zen meditation class.

11:19.040 --> 11:22.920
Buzzumba's a little
too intense

11:22.920 --> 11:26.330
and dramatic for a really
calm person like myself.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.080
Anyway, I gotta go.
There's this really calming

11:31.080 --> 11:34.000
nature documentary on
that I would hate to miss.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.420
But not so much that
I'd cause a scene.

11:36.420 --> 11:39.120
You know, I would just
be upset like, um...

11:39.120 --> 11:41.380
a normal amount.

11:43.420 --> 11:45.000
Namaste.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.750
You didn't tell her
what I said about her, did you?

11:50.750 --> 11:52.420
Oh, no, no.
Of course not.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.120
But I really think that
if you got to know Marisa,

11:54.120 --> 11:55.290
you'd really like her.

11:55.290 --> 11:57.290
Yeah, I don't
know about that.

11:57.290 --> 11:59.750
You know when you meet
somebody that just rubs
you the wrong way,

11:59.750 --> 12:02.170
and everything they say
is like nails down a chalkboard?

12:02.170 --> 12:04.080
[makes screeching sound]

12:04.080 --> 12:06.790
Nope, nope, never met
someone like that.

12:06.790 --> 12:07.880
Nope?

12:07.880 --> 12:10.250
[phone rings]

12:10.250 --> 12:12.460
Hi, Mom.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.250
Hi. Following your plan,

12:14.250 --> 12:17.170
and calling you at
the time you told me to.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.790
What do you mean,
you can't pick me up?

12:18.790 --> 12:21.290
How am I supposed
to get home?

12:21.290 --> 12:24.250
Okay, fine, I guess
I'll just...

12:24.250 --> 12:28.040
be alone in a cold,
dark parking lot.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.880
Hopefully no scary vans
will drive by

12:31.880 --> 12:34.040
and slow down
each time they pass.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.170
No, no.

12:36.170 --> 12:38.880
If you need a ride home,
my parents can take you.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.120
Oh, okay. Well, in that case,
it's all good, Mom.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.580
The Bishops are gonna
take me home.

12:43.580 --> 12:45.790
And we'll be here
waiting for them.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.580
It's great to finally
meet you guys.

12:50.580 --> 12:52.880
You, too, and thanks so much
for bringing KC home.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.790
Well, it was either that
or feed her, clothe her,

12:55.790 --> 12:57.420
and send her to college.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.250
I apologize for
my dad's "jokes."

13:02.250 --> 13:05.120
Yeah, well, I apologize for
my mother encouraging him

13:05.120 --> 13:07.830
with her fake laughter.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.040
Kira, where are
my special measuring spoons?

13:10.040 --> 13:12.460
In the drawer
where they always are.

13:12.460 --> 13:14.290
What are you doing
over there, Craig?

13:14.290 --> 13:17.880
Oh-ho, I'm putting together
my special spice rub

13:17.880 --> 13:19.210
for our barbecue tomorrow.

13:19.210 --> 13:20.750
I'm making my famous
Kansas City ribs.

13:20.750 --> 13:23.500
Kansas City ribs?!

13:23.500 --> 13:25.880
Those are my favorites.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.710
Actually, he'll
eat anything.

13:28.710 --> 13:30.710
Nobody makes
ribs like I do.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.250
I have a special rub
handed down three generations.

13:33.250 --> 13:37.120
Yeah, that originally came
in the back of a magazine.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.920
- Craig.
- Mm-hmm.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.170
What's in your rub?

13:40.170 --> 13:42.880
Mitch, please.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.120
We just met.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.710
Hey, why don't you guys
come to dinner tomorrow?

13:47.710 --> 13:49.960
Oh, we wouldn't
wanna impose.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.040
We're inviting you;
you're not imposing.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.750
I fly my ribs in
all the way from Kansas City.

13:54.750 --> 13:58.080
He flies them in.
Honey, please!

13:58.080 --> 14:02.040
Okay, fine.
We'd love to come.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.500
Great. Now we have to spend
tomorrow with our parents.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.210
So annoying, right?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.330
Hey, smells good
out here.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.460
That's right.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.750
Uh-uh-uh.

14:16.750 --> 14:19.210
Mitch, please.
No peeking.

14:19.210 --> 14:21.330
If you wanna know,
I'll tell you

14:21.330 --> 14:23.330
two of the secret
ingredients in my rub.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.420
- Yeah, thank you.
I'm listening.
- Okay.

14:25.420 --> 14:28.380
Patience,
and mind your business.

14:28.380 --> 14:31.710
Come on. At least
tell me what kind
of salt you use.

14:31.710 --> 14:33.960
Standard, kosher,
pink Himalayan?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.000
Come on, man, you
gotta give me something!

14:36.000 --> 14:39.250
It's like your husband's
protecting state secrets
or something.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.830
Yeah, well,
what can I say?

14:40.830 --> 14:42.830
Craig is serious
about his meat.

14:42.830 --> 14:44.710
The man barbecues
twice a year,

14:44.710 --> 14:47.670
which leaves 363 days
for me to cook.

14:47.670 --> 14:49.750
At least he grills
twice a year.

14:49.750 --> 14:53.790
Mitch, oh, he couldn't
make ice if I wrote out
the recipe.

14:55.330 --> 14:57.540
My dad is
so embarrassing.

14:57.540 --> 15:00.170
Yeah, I'm just glad
my dad didn't wear
his stupid apron

15:00.170 --> 15:02.040
with the six-pack
abs on it.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.420
Oh, I spoke too soon.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.210
Hey, Ernie, can you
help me get the guacamole?

15:09.210 --> 15:10.330
Why do I have to help?

15:10.330 --> 15:11.830
Because I need
your help.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.880
All right,
you know the plan?
You know what you're doing?

15:18.880 --> 15:20.790
I come up with
a believable excuse to leave

15:20.790 --> 15:22.670
and break into
the Bishops' house.

15:22.670 --> 15:25.040
You guys will pump them
for personal information

15:25.040 --> 15:26.250
that'll help me
crack that computer password.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.380
Perfect. And we'll have
that distribution list

15:28.380 --> 15:30.620
before they're done
picking rib meat
out their teeth.

15:30.620 --> 15:32.120
Guacamole!

15:36.380 --> 15:38.290
Hey, would you
look at that?

15:38.290 --> 15:39.880
Amber, the prettiest
girl in school,

15:39.880 --> 15:42.040
wants me to come over
and help her study.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.500
What do you expect
when you're this smart
and irresistible?

15:44.500 --> 15:49.290
Mom, Dad, would you be upset
if I sashayed on outta here?

15:49.290 --> 15:51.330
Of course not.

15:51.330 --> 15:52.880
He is such
a ladies man.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.460
Oh, hey.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.250
There you are.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.620
You okay?

16:03.620 --> 16:06.380
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.170
You hardly seem fine.

16:08.170 --> 16:11.080
You can talk to me about it;
I'm a friend.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.670
I don't know.

16:12.670 --> 16:14.830
It's just, it feels like
it was yesterday

16:14.830 --> 16:16.330
that I was Judy's age,

16:16.330 --> 16:18.120
and I was actually
playing this game.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.790
Now it's just
such a stressful time.

16:20.790 --> 16:24.420
I'm about to graduate,
and our entire lives
are gonna change.

16:26.290 --> 16:28.290
What if I don't
like college?

16:28.290 --> 16:30.960
What if I miss my family,
what if I don't pick
the right major?

16:30.960 --> 16:32.920
I still don't know
what I wanna be

16:32.920 --> 16:35.330
when I grow up,
and apparently, I am grown up.

16:35.330 --> 16:38.670
I don't feel
grown up.

16:38.670 --> 16:42.080
I guess I feel
confused about everything.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.420
Sit down.

16:46.420 --> 16:51.290
Look, anybody who says
that they got it all figured out

16:51.290 --> 16:53.500
is either lying
or kidding themselves.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.500
I know that everyone
in our grade

16:55.500 --> 16:57.670
is stressed about
the exact same stuff.

16:57.670 --> 17:00.500
I know I'm confused,
and I'm valedictorian,

17:00.500 --> 17:03.420
so technically, I'm
supposed to be smarter
than everybody.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.420
KC, can I admit something?

17:05.420 --> 17:07.000
Yeah, sure.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.330
I don't really
have a lot of friends.

17:09.330 --> 17:11.540
I guess people
tend to find me...

17:11.540 --> 17:12.580
annoying.

17:12.580 --> 17:13.830
What?

17:13.830 --> 17:15.250
You? No.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.420
Yeah, I know.

17:17.420 --> 17:18.790
I mean, I don't
get it either.

17:20.500 --> 17:24.040
Hey, I'm also really
sorry about what I said
about Marisa.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.540
If she's your friend,
she has to be cool.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.330
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

17:30.330 --> 17:33.330
I'm really lucky
to have you as a friend,

17:33.330 --> 17:35.960
to have somebody
I can talk to
and trust.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.790
Uh, yeah, yeah.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.960
Of course.
I mean,

17:39.960 --> 17:42.080
buzzumba isn't just
a workout class, right?

17:42.080 --> 17:44.170
It's a sisterhood.
Bring it in.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.830
Okay, Ernie,
what's your position?

17:52.830 --> 17:54.500
- Can you hear us?
-  Loud and clear.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.540
I'm at the computer,
and I'm ready when you are.

17:56.540 --> 17:59.420
Let's get some information
on the Bishops.

17:59.420 --> 18:01.500
Hey, you know what?

18:01.500 --> 18:03.170
Why don't we play
a fun game

18:03.170 --> 18:06.080
where we get to know
each other better?

18:06.080 --> 18:08.420
It's called,
"What's your diva name?"

18:08.420 --> 18:10.380
Oh, okay,
I love that game.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.080
It's basically a combination
of your first pet's name

18:12.080 --> 18:14.620
and the street that
you grew up on.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.000
I'll go first.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.790
So, um, we had
a cat named Fluffy,

18:17.790 --> 18:19.540
and we live on
Melby Lane,

18:19.540 --> 18:22.670
so that means my diva name
is Fluffy Melby.

18:22.670 --> 18:24.290
[laughter]

18:24.290 --> 18:26.710
All right.
That would make me

18:26.710 --> 18:29.880
Rover 123rd Avenue.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.120
I guess I'm not really
the diva type.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.120
[forced laughter]
No, honey, you're no diva.

18:38.670 --> 18:41.250
And my diva name is...

18:41.250 --> 18:42.670
Cuddles Fenimore!

18:42.670 --> 18:46.380
I think I once
dated a Cuddles Fenimore.

18:46.380 --> 18:48.790
And ironically, she didn't
even like to cuddle.

18:48.790 --> 18:49.880
[laughter]

18:49.880 --> 18:51.000
Okay, my turn.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.790
Okay, finally.

18:52.790 --> 18:54.620
Something that might
help me with this password.

18:54.620 --> 18:56.080
My diva name is--

18:56.080 --> 18:59.210
Well, well, well.

19:01.290 --> 19:02.880
Oh, great. As usual,

19:02.880 --> 19:04.880
Marisa's timing
is impeccable.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.080
What is going on here?

19:07.080 --> 19:09.750
Uh, now's not really
a good time.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.790
We're just having
a little family barbecue.

19:11.790 --> 19:13.540
Oh, and I wasn't invited.

19:13.540 --> 19:15.670
I know I'm not a Cooper
or a Bishop,

19:15.670 --> 19:17.290
but as far as
I can tell,

19:17.290 --> 19:18.920
Bishops aren't Coopers
and Coopers aren't Bishops

19:18.920 --> 19:20.750
so you're already
playing fast and loose,

19:20.750 --> 19:23.120
with this whole
family barbecue thing.
Yeah, I'd love to join.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.040
We were hoping
you'd say that.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.960
Well, we were just playing
"What's your diva name?"

19:28.960 --> 19:30.920
Who was up?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.330
Oh, Danielle.

19:32.330 --> 19:33.880
So it's--

19:33.880 --> 19:36.330
My first pet
was a goldfish,

19:36.330 --> 19:39.170
but it died before
we got a chance to name it.

19:39.170 --> 19:41.500
So it's No-name Melby.
We got it, movin' on.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.460
But I didn't move
to Melby Lane

19:43.460 --> 19:46.080
until I was three, so
what was my first street name?

19:46.080 --> 19:47.460
It was some
sort of bird.

19:47.460 --> 19:50.670
I'm thinking dodo.
Get her outta there.

19:50.670 --> 19:52.540
Oh, Flamingo.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.670
Flamingo Road.
And we had

19:54.670 --> 19:56.960
this cute little gerbil
named Gary.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.710
He used to leave gerbil pellets
all over the house.

19:59.710 --> 20:01.500
So it's
Gerbil Poop Flamingo.
That's great.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.540
Um, back to you guys.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.670
Guys, come on.
I'm sitting in their house.

20:07.670 --> 20:09.830
Give me something
I can use.

20:09.830 --> 20:11.710
This entire mission
is going south.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.040
KC, do something.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.670
You were saying,
Mrs. Bishop.

20:14.670 --> 20:17.710
- Okay, so--
- Bluebird Road!

20:17.710 --> 20:19.040
It wasn't Flamingo Road,
it was Bluebird Road.

20:20.460 --> 20:22.620
Marisa, please, could you
just stop interrupting,

20:22.620 --> 20:24.250
'cause we're trying
to play a game here,

20:24.250 --> 20:26.000
and we're getting
to the Bishops.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.620
Mrs. Bishop,
Mr. Bishop.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.540
Either of you
wanna go?

20:29.540 --> 20:31.250
Oh, wow, okay.

20:31.250 --> 20:33.670
I guess it's
all about the Bishops.

20:33.670 --> 20:35.540
I'll just sit here
quietly because apparently

20:35.540 --> 20:39.250
you don't care about
anyone else but the Bishops.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.880
O...kay.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.830
I'm sorry, we're
gonna have to leave.

20:43.830 --> 20:45.040
What's wrong, Dad?

20:45.040 --> 20:47.540
It's my stomach,
and it's acting up again.

20:47.540 --> 20:50.080
We better get you
home to bed, honey.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.040
Come on, Amy.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.210
- But, Mom...
- Amy, now.

20:54.210 --> 20:55.750
Don't go.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.120
We have antacid
in the bathroom.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.920
We also have
the pink stuff.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.830
It doesn't taste very good,
but it works.

21:00.830 --> 21:01.830
We gotta go.

21:01.830 --> 21:03.880
Come on, you haven't
even eaten yet.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.210
Nothing settles
an upset stomach

21:06.210 --> 21:08.210
- like a greasy
plate of ribs.
- Maybe another time.

21:13.330 --> 21:15.710
Really, Marisa, really.
That's...

21:17.670 --> 21:19.750
Judy.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.620
- Hey, what's up?
- Get on the com
and tell Ernie

21:21.620 --> 21:23.960
- to get out of
that house now.
- Okay, I'm on it.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.750
- Well, that went well.
- Tell me about it.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.380
This mission
is starting to get to me.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.620
I told you, whether
I'm at school,

21:31.620 --> 21:34.750
or I'm at work,
or I'm home,

21:34.750 --> 21:36.710
everything is about Amy
and the Bishops,

21:36.710 --> 21:38.330
and I can't
take it anymore.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.620
I know Marisa
messed up back there,

21:40.620 --> 21:42.710
but it's because I haven't
been able to spend

21:42.710 --> 21:44.080
any time with her.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.750
And worse, I know I said
that Amy was annoying,

21:46.750 --> 21:49.580
but now I like her.

21:49.580 --> 21:51.750
Since when?
She's the enemy.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.580
Is she?
I don't know that.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.420
I had this talk with her,

21:56.420 --> 21:58.120
and now every bone
in my body is telling me

21:58.120 --> 21:59.960
that she's not a spy.

21:59.960 --> 22:02.960
She's just a 17-year-old girl,
and she's a mess,

22:02.960 --> 22:05.500
and she's vulnerable
and confused

22:05.500 --> 22:07.580
and scared about the future,
and honestly,

22:07.580 --> 22:08.830
she's a lot like me.

22:08.830 --> 22:10.620
KC, let me
ask you a question.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.830
If this situation
were reversed,

22:12.830 --> 22:14.620
and you were protecting
your cover, what would you do?

22:14.620 --> 22:18.380
I'd... make myself
appear to be

22:18.380 --> 22:20.790
as much like the target
as possible.

22:20.790 --> 22:23.000
to throw them
off my track,

22:23.000 --> 22:24.830
but that's not
what she's doing.

22:24.830 --> 22:26.790
At least, I don't think
that's what she's doing.

22:26.790 --> 22:28.620
I don't know.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.500
Something is wrong
with Ernie's com.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.880
He's not answering me.
He must've forgotten
to charge it.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.750
So that means they're
on the way to their house,

22:34.750 --> 22:36.670
- and he's there and...
- We need to get
him out of there.

22:36.670 --> 22:39.080
I'm going old school.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.620
Hey, Dad, what's going on?

22:40.620 --> 22:41.880
Ernie, get out
of that house now.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.790
Why? I haven't even
begun to...

22:50.580 --> 22:51.880
Rob, your name's on TV.
