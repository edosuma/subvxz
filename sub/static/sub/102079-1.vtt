WEBVTT

02:05.708 --> 02:07.627
My cash just ran out.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.088
It's real rice, not the molecular stuff--

02:20.807 --> 02:22.851
Wait! Hold on.

02:23.393 --> 02:27.647
I just want a quick look,
how can you charge me every time?

02:30.024 --> 02:32.318
What do you know? Let go!

02:32.402 --> 02:34.279
Just let me look!

02:42.245 --> 02:44.956
Found these yesterday and fixed them up.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.710
I was the only one on my ship
without boots--

09:01.582 --> 09:04.835
Speed's at 7 km/sec, still slow.

09:09.882 --> 09:13.719
<i>It's going from District D 79.348 to 30.</i>

09:15.596 --> 09:18.724
<i>You who hooked the satellite, stay away.</i>

09:19.225 --> 09:21.852
<i>That'll cost you at least 800 dollars.</i>

09:31.362 --> 09:33.364
-Who?
-Who do you think?

09:33.447 --> 09:35.783
<i>I heard he went down to Earth yesterday.</i>

09:36.367 --> 09:38.536
They can't be back yet.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.877
<i>-You said they wouldn't be here!</i>
<i>-We're fucked!</i>

09:52.133 --> 09:55.136
VICTORY

10:01.183 --> 10:04.562
Out of the way, you incompetent fools.

10:06.355 --> 10:07.690
That one's mine.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.360
Step on it.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.956
God, this is exhausting.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.633
<i>Stop them!</i>

10:45.394 --> 10:47.563
<i>Grab it!</i>

10:50.066 --> 10:51.692
<i>I'll kill those sons of bitches!</i>

10:52.443 --> 10:55.446
<i>-Kill them!</i>
-God, what a racket!

10:55.529 --> 11:00.701
All that swearing,
not a cultured mind in the whole crowd.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.047
<i>Too slow, Mr. Park!</i>

11:13.130 --> 11:16.133
<i>It's too slow! Hey, it's too slow!</i>

11:30.940 --> 11:33.734
How long will I have to do this
all by hand?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.661
Let's wrap things up.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.678
<i>They're getting away! Step on it!</i>

12:03.848 --> 12:06.267
<i>Just catch them!</i>

12:15.943 --> 12:17.361
<i>Can't you share?</i>

12:20.573 --> 12:22.116
<i>Think about the other ships!</i>

12:22.616 --> 12:24.535
Damn you!

12:24.618 --> 12:26.787
Why make me think of other ships?

12:34.503 --> 12:36.797
Everyone on your toes!

13:00.070 --> 13:03.783
<i>You're dead if we catch you!</i>

13:03.866 --> 13:05.451
<i>-Human trash!</i>
<i>-We'll get you next time!</i>

13:09.079 --> 13:11.290
Ethics, my ass.

13:11.373 --> 13:12.917
Not a chance.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.423
These guys really give it their all.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.343
Fighting like kids
over a few measly dollars.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.972
<i>What? What's that?</i>

13:30.684 --> 13:32.812
<i>Hey, what the hell?</i>

13:32.895 --> 13:34.480
<i>Slow down!</i>

13:39.151 --> 13:42.905
<i>Watch the antenna!</i>
<i>There's a fine if you break it!</i>

13:43.864 --> 13:45.241
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

14:26.323 --> 14:28.117
-But what about the car?
-The garage is full.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.369
However,
if you want us to take it from you,

14:30.452 --> 14:32.872
you need to pay extra 70K for reassembly.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.457
If you don’t want to pay,
you dismantle it and bring it back in.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.628
And I see you broke
an antenna off a jelly.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.839
You need to pay 1,300 dollars for that.

14:41.922 --> 14:45.092
We will deduct from your money
and withdraw the rest from your account.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.887
These are your taxes. Pay up.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.268
Why show me the cash?

14:54.351 --> 14:57.688
If you're not giving it to me,
why count it out? You pig!

15:01.317 --> 15:02.651
This is my company's money.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.364
Karum, watch your back.
I'll get you one day.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.868
-Any organic matter?
-Just one.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.413
In the Thunderbolt, 12 kg of iced pork.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.582
Accident. Refrigerated spaceship.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.172
It’s been three years now.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.926
About Su-ni. What will you do?

15:27.009 --> 15:29.261
What do you think? Earn cash.

15:29.345 --> 15:32.264
I'll do anything for cash.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.226
Anything, really.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.158
How's Captain Jang? Beautiful as ever?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.786
She has a message for you.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.412
For me? What did she say?

15:55.496 --> 15:57.289
Call her once more, and she'll kill you.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.626
All right.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.253
Let's watch TV.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.345
She looks so real.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.643
Those Black Foxes give me the creeps.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.729
See you.

16:28.070 --> 16:28.946
<i>Ciao.</i>

16:33.867 --> 16:36.161
<i>You guys made Victory</i>
<i>with reinforced duralumin structure.</i>

16:36.245 --> 16:41.542
<i>Quantum radar. Top speed 48,000.</i>
<i>3.2 million pounds of thrust.</i>

16:41.625 --> 16:44.670
<i>If you've got that kind of beast ship,</i>
<i>why don't you make money?</i>

16:45.254 --> 16:46.839
<i>It's all debt.</i>

16:47.381 --> 16:51.427
<i>It's still just a trash collector.</i>
<i>Captain Jang keeps overdoing it.</i>

16:51.927 --> 16:56.223
<i>Between repairs and fines,</i>
<i>we just pay debt with more debt.</i>

16:56.306 --> 16:57.683
<i>But you are a good team.</i>

16:57.766 --> 16:59.685
<i>Team, my ass.</i>

17:00.185 --> 17:01.937
<i>We're a mess.</i>

17:17.369 --> 17:18.537
For me, check!

17:27.921 --> 17:29.757
He's got a ten-pair.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.052
This is one dollar per round.
Why so serious?

17:33.135 --> 17:34.428
I'll raise the minimum.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.306
Even if you beat everyone, it's ten bucks.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.059
I see you, and raise two.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.145
I fold.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.943
Shut your mouth!

17:50.027 --> 17:53.405
I don't have a mouth. Why so sensitive?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.824
Let's quit after this hand.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.118
It's no fun anyway.
And you're all getting touchy.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.454
There's something I need to address.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.248
What could he be addressing now?

18:03.332 --> 18:06.210
Can't bail on this round. Call!

18:06.293 --> 18:07.544
The rice is gone.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.090
I was saving it for a special day.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.717
Last time, the toolbox.
Before that, the battery.

18:14.927 --> 18:19.973
Someone's pilfering supplies
and selling them for cash.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.477
Captain,

18:24.311 --> 18:27.815
how'd you buy that booze?
It's 80 dollars a bottle.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.859
Shut up. I see you, and raise ten.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.571
No excuses. Don't insult my intelligence.

18:34.655 --> 18:38.117
There's a time I'd have strung up
your corpse as a warning.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.536
Someone's losing his mind.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.372
Do you want to get strung up?

18:43.455 --> 18:46.917
Our loan deferrals end this month,
then we have to pay 2,000 per month.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.462
-Don't forget.
-Didn't it get extended? How much is left?

18:50.546 --> 18:55.551
Well, 16,000 or 17,000 dollars,

18:55.634 --> 18:57.761
plus the 9,000 you borrowed
from the guild, and then…

18:57.845 --> 19:00.848
I'll uncover that thief today for sure.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.766
I know nothing about this nonsense,

19:02.850 --> 19:04.726
but let's talk after the game.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.563
And the court ordered
a provisional seizure,

19:07.646 --> 19:08.730
so you're basically screwed.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.773
Bubs.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.401
You can stop now. I fold.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.863
Okay,
there's one more thing, but forget it.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.031
What thing?

19:18.115 --> 19:19.533
Porky ran off.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.995
-What?
-He split. Porky.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.746
The one managing our fund.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.499
Quite the uproar. Doubt they'll catch him.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.168
-Are you serious?
-Okay, show your cards!

19:31.461 --> 19:33.589
I won again! This is so boring.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.632
-Captain, you knew?
-A deuce?

19:37.426 --> 19:38.760
You said it would be safe!

19:38.844 --> 19:41.221
We had so much money in there!

19:41.305 --> 19:44.766
-One more round tomorrow.
-Hey! That was 100K, our whole savings!

19:44.850 --> 19:47.019
-Why should we call you Captain?
-Where's my money?

19:47.102 --> 19:48.520
Where's my rice?

19:49.980 --> 19:51.190
Captain Jang!

19:52.024 --> 19:53.025
Oh, sorry.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.695
Too slow.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.464
Scary crowd.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.508
TOUCH THIS AND I'LL BREAK YOUR WRIST

20:28.560 --> 20:30.854
How many zeros?

20:31.396 --> 20:33.232
Damn, that's expensive.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.193
When I caught one, I'd cut off both hands.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.947
Keep one myself, send one to his boss.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.741
There you go again.
It's a sign of dementia, Mr. Park.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.660
Not Mr. Park, I'm Tiger Park.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.371
Then what'd you do with all those hands?

20:48.789 --> 20:50.832
-Don't believe me?
-I do.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.543
I just wish I could have one.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.296
Graphene titanium.
The equalizer. Dead in one swing.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.881
You or me.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.384
Stop talking nonsense and get to work!

21:00.884 --> 21:03.845
God, I hate working.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.306
For a ship from Lagrangian Point,
it's in good shape,

21:06.390 --> 21:09.518
usually the nanobots
would've eaten it all.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.271
You don't think
nanobots infected our ship?

21:12.354 --> 21:14.773
Infected? They're everywhere.

21:14.856 --> 21:19.903
They're no ordinary nanobots.
Lagrangians are indestructible.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.447
Imagine if our ship got a hole.
We'd all be dead!

21:22.531 --> 21:25.951
Don't worry,
we'll all have starved to death by then.

21:28.412 --> 21:32.249
Is being poor a sin,
or am I poor because I sinned?

21:33.583 --> 21:38.046
If you all starve to death,
the ship becomes mine.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.347
A missing child.

23:11.306 --> 23:14.351
Our work is stopped,
now the police will get us.

23:14.434 --> 23:17.312
We'll get fined for the dumbest reasons.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.944
-So annoying.
-What a headache.

23:24.027 --> 23:26.321
Maybe her parents will pay us a reward?

23:28.156 --> 23:29.408
Are you a UTS citizen?

23:29.491 --> 23:30.992
She has no translation device.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.955
-U-T-what?
-She's Korean?

23:35.038 --> 23:37.040
I mean, are you from a rich home?

23:37.124 --> 23:38.542
I have no home.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.462
But I'm hungry.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.922
I want to eat.

23:44.005 --> 23:47.008
Hey, shut up. Kid's got no manners.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.301
How shameless.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.515
She was in that car?

23:53.598 --> 23:57.269
In the rear seat's airbag.
Don't know how she survived.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.857
Feel like I've seen
that bowl cut somewhere.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.903
Su-ni! Where is our Su-ni hiding?

24:07.863 --> 24:08.947
There you are!

24:12.117 --> 24:14.453
Take her to the security center
when we dock.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.306
-We've met, right?
-No.

24:56.786 --> 24:57.621
Get down!

25:19.226 --> 25:20.685
Get out!

25:26.233 --> 25:27.317
No!

25:40.664 --> 25:41.581
She's a robot?

25:41.665 --> 25:43.375
An explosive?

25:43.458 --> 25:45.544
No wonder the scanner didn't detect life.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.046
Her skin grafts are amazing.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.215
<i>Shit, it's moving.</i>

25:50.298 --> 25:53.635
<i>-Will it get offended and blow up?</i>
<i>-Just shut up and report it.</i>

25:53.718 --> 25:56.012
Nine, zero, zero.

26:01.017 --> 26:01.935
Non-citizen.

26:02.018 --> 26:04.563
<i>Can't we tie it up outside the ship? Bubs?</i>

26:04.646 --> 26:07.107
<i>Why do I always do the dangerous work?</i>

26:07.190 --> 26:09.693
<i>Number 14 for miscellaneous crimes.</i>
<i>Is this a miscellaneous crime?</i>

26:09.776 --> 26:12.070
<i>First, tie it up. Paper, rock, scissors.</i>

26:12.153 --> 26:13.446
Paper, rock, scissors!

26:28.044 --> 26:30.255
Stay away! Don't come closer!

26:30.338 --> 26:32.549
-I tried wiping up the water--
-Don't talk!

26:32.632 --> 26:35.218
<i>-God, he's useless.</i>
<i>-What an idiot.</i>

26:35.302 --> 26:36.469
<i>Jeez.</i>

26:36.553 --> 26:39.055
Don't look at me. Take easy breaths.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.725
Don't get any ideas.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.435
I'm not a good person.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.279
A pet robot?

26:56.323 --> 26:58.158
Give me a break.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.204
WRITING KOREAN

27:04.497 --> 27:06.708
"Kang Hyeo-nu"? Who's that?

27:17.469 --> 27:18.845
"Kang Hyeo-nu."

27:23.475 --> 27:24.309
"Kang Hyeo-nu."

27:24.893 --> 27:28.021
Missed calls up to a moment ago.

27:36.404 --> 27:38.031
Guys, let's talk.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.914
<i>She's going to blow!</i>

28:38.800 --> 28:41.219
-You called?
-I registered a miscellaneous crime.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.679
-Think they'll come?
-Never.

28:42.762 --> 28:43.763
Right.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.348
Listen up.

28:45.432 --> 28:48.518
Two Black Foxes took the robot
and got shot down.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.520
One was captured, one escaped.

28:50.603 --> 28:52.814
The robot entered
Lagrangian Point alone. So…

28:53.356 --> 28:56.860
Both the Black Foxes
and the Space Guards are looking for it.

28:56.943 --> 29:00.113
I have no idea what you're trying to say.

29:01.656 --> 29:02.824
I'm saying we can make

29:04.534 --> 29:06.161
some money off this.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.747
-"Money"?
-Can non-citizens collect rewards?

29:08.830 --> 29:10.165
-No.
-Let me get this straight.

29:10.248 --> 29:13.626
You want to sell that bomb
to the Black Foxes.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.421
Make some money off those terrorists?

29:16.504 --> 29:18.047
I bet they'll pay a million.

29:18.131 --> 29:21.050
-"A million"?
-No way. That's unjust.

29:22.677 --> 29:23.720
What bullshit is that?

29:24.971 --> 29:25.889
Forget it, then!

29:26.806 --> 29:28.224
I'll take the bomb--

29:29.476 --> 29:31.019
You think it's your bomb?

29:31.102 --> 29:34.105
A direct call to Space Guards,
and they'll come in five minutes.

29:34.189 --> 29:38.443
All right, four for the Captain,
three each for Mr. Park and me.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.492
-Yeah, that's great!
-All right.

29:46.534 --> 29:49.746
Three and a half,
three and a half, two, one. Good?

29:49.829 --> 29:51.915
-"One"?
-You're three and a half, I'm two?

29:51.998 --> 29:53.625
Why'd I fall to three and a half?

29:53.708 --> 29:55.460
How should I interpret this?

29:55.543 --> 29:57.086
Give me back my one half.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.297
This is total crap.

29:59.380 --> 30:02.884
Four, three, two, one for me, okay?

30:05.136 --> 30:08.348
-You all are going to hell.
-Right!

30:08.431 --> 30:11.309
But can you really pull this off?
Want me to do it?

30:11.392 --> 30:14.729
Mr. Park,
did you forget where I came from?

30:15.939 --> 30:17.649
I know those sorts of bastards.

30:17.732 --> 30:20.026
Don't be scared of them--

30:20.109 --> 30:21.319
Aren't you going to order?

30:21.820 --> 30:24.364
This time, order or get out.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.366
One cola.

30:28.743 --> 30:29.577
Where'd she go?

30:30.328 --> 30:31.412
Where is she?

30:32.080 --> 30:35.333
What's she drawing? A giraffe?

30:35.917 --> 30:37.752
Damned kid, drawing in my room?

30:38.962 --> 30:40.630
But the transmission mic is broken.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.507
Connect ours and raise the pitch.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.175
-What's this?
-A smartphone.

30:44.259 --> 30:47.262
Uses private satellites,
so are hard to trace. Criminals love them.

30:47.345 --> 30:51.349
Didn't you say one was caught?
If so, Space Guards might be listening in.

30:51.432 --> 30:54.269
I don't know technical stuff.

30:54.352 --> 30:56.020
But you know the Black Foxes?

30:56.104 --> 30:58.022
They weren't around when I worked.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.567
Do you know anything?

31:01.609 --> 31:03.778
Ready. Okay?

31:03.862 --> 31:04.988
Yes.

31:05.071 --> 31:05.947
I'm doing it.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.961
Hello?

31:24.924 --> 31:27.468
Do you own this object, Dr. Kang?

31:29.387 --> 31:30.555
<i>How much do you want?</i>

31:33.349 --> 31:35.310
How much?

31:39.522 --> 31:40.523
Two million.

31:41.524 --> 31:42.567
No!

31:44.068 --> 31:45.570
One and a half million.

31:46.696 --> 31:52.702
If you really insist,
we'll give you a discount.

31:52.785 --> 31:54.954
<i>Two million. In cash.</i>

31:55.914 --> 31:57.749
<i>Let's meet immediately.</i>

31:58.416 --> 32:00.335
<i>I'll pay you once I see it.</i>

32:01.753 --> 32:05.715
<i>By Exit two</i>
<i>of the Zenith Telescope Station.</i>

32:05.798 --> 32:08.593
<i>Zone G, at 13:00!</i>

32:09.260 --> 32:12.096
Not there. No!

32:13.973 --> 32:18.436
At 32nd Commercial District, Club Ghost,

32:18.519 --> 32:22.315
in front of Gate two at 14:00.

32:24.275 --> 32:27.070
Just a minute!

32:28.863 --> 32:31.366
I'm worried about an explosion.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.702
Should I take precautions?

32:36.037 --> 32:38.873
<i>It won't explode without an order.</i>

32:39.374 --> 32:42.043
<i>If this is a prank call, you will die.</i>

32:42.126 --> 32:45.129
<i>Don't be late. We won't wait.</i>

32:55.390 --> 32:57.392
Drink up!

32:57.475 --> 32:58.977
You deserve it!

32:59.602 --> 33:01.229
I knew you could do it!

33:09.779 --> 33:13.825
<i>At 32nd Commercial District, Club Ghost,</i>

33:13.908 --> 33:17.662
<i>in front of Gate two at 14:00.</i>

33:28.297 --> 33:31.509
Don't make a move. I said to stay still.

33:31.592 --> 33:33.344
That's what I'm doing.

33:38.141 --> 33:40.852
That's a giraffe? You're a lousy artist.

33:40.935 --> 33:42.478
It's a dinosaur.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.989
Let's search for dinosaurs.

33:53.990 --> 33:58.828
Take a good look.
This is a dinosaur, okay?

34:01.080 --> 34:02.665
That's a dinosaur, too.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.418
Look, it's the same.

34:10.131 --> 34:12.008
-Anyway--
-I drew you, too!

34:16.054 --> 34:19.640
This one I recognize.

34:21.392 --> 34:23.436
But the eyes are too small, look.

34:24.395 --> 34:25.897
Make the eyes bigger?

34:25.980 --> 34:27.315
That's right.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.109
Look here. The nose, too.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.779
-The nose, too?
-More handsome.

34:38.701 --> 34:40.703
You like doing that, don't you?

34:40.787 --> 34:44.373
If you ever feel sick,
say something right away.

34:44.457 --> 34:46.417
So people can run, okay?

34:46.501 --> 34:48.211
Okay, climb in here.

34:48.294 --> 34:50.129
Uncle Tiger! Where am I going?

34:54.133 --> 34:56.219
Okay, everybody ready? Five minutes!

34:56.302 --> 34:58.179
The engine's looking bad.
It might not make it.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.430
If we're late, we're dead!

34:59.514 --> 35:01.057
Come here. Bubs, come here.

35:01.140 --> 35:03.101
It's two million dollars. Okay?

35:03.601 --> 35:06.437
Let's all shout, "Let's go!"
One, two, three! Let's go!

35:08.147 --> 35:10.817
Who the hell is it? We're busy!

35:10.900 --> 35:12.318
Didn't you lock the door?

35:18.282 --> 35:19.117
Back to your places.

35:21.744 --> 35:22.662
Now!

35:28.334 --> 35:30.419
I'm forcing the door!

35:38.719 --> 35:40.596
Why didn't you open up?

35:41.556 --> 35:43.599
No respect for the UTS Police?

35:43.683 --> 35:47.520
The door. Why won't the door open?

35:49.564 --> 35:53.192
You really went wild
on the illegal modifications to your ship.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.778
Our captain is good with tools.

35:55.862 --> 35:58.823
Such an ugly ship
is an insult to UTS citizens.

35:58.906 --> 36:00.158
We'll make her stop.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.160
What the hell?

36:02.994 --> 36:04.495
Isn't this military equipment?

36:06.831 --> 36:07.707
Where did you get it?

36:07.790 --> 36:11.794
Captain got it from the recycling center.
It's very friendly.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.929
Why grow plants on a spaceship?

36:22.013 --> 36:25.850
We're actually in a rush.
What brings you here?

36:25.933 --> 36:27.435
That's what I want to know.

36:27.518 --> 36:30.354
You're the one who called the police.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.064
Number 14. Miscellaneous crimes.

36:41.949 --> 36:44.744
Sir, that wasn't a report,
we just wanted to ask something!

37:07.850 --> 37:11.145
We've got two minutes! God dammit!

37:12.313 --> 37:14.023
Who were you looking at?

37:17.902 --> 37:20.655
What are you doing? Why take my money?

37:24.909 --> 37:26.202
Fine, we're all on our own now.

37:27.787 --> 37:30.748
-Bubs, let me use it!
-You scumbag!

37:30.831 --> 37:34.335
Sir, we have a really important meeting.

37:34.418 --> 37:35.711
Just wait a second!

37:39.006 --> 37:40.466
Did you record that?

37:42.426 --> 37:44.095
What's the occasion?

37:44.178 --> 37:47.139
Non-citizens usually have to call
five to six times for a response.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.309
Bubs, did you record him taking the money?

37:51.227 --> 37:55.564
Sure, I got it in detail!

37:55.648 --> 37:58.442
Your patrol lights are off,
so you're off duty.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.779
What happens if we report you
for taking bribes after work?

38:01.862 --> 38:04.073
Crazy bitch! I didn't ask for bribes.

38:04.156 --> 38:07.535
Didn't announce your name or regiment.
And a private gun?

38:07.618 --> 38:09.120
He's got some nerve.

38:09.787 --> 38:12.665
Don't illegal weapons
get you banished to Earth?

38:12.748 --> 38:16.168
That's right.
We've got a real cowboy here!

38:16.252 --> 38:18.170
A gun like that
should be kept disassembled.

38:18.254 --> 38:21.632
Abusing authority won't get you anywhere.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.968
Patrol officers
are non-citizens just like us.

38:24.051 --> 38:26.220
So who are you to smack me in the head?

38:26.304 --> 38:28.222
Who are you to smack Bubs in the head?

38:29.181 --> 38:30.016
Anyway…

38:30.808 --> 38:35.438
If you want to erase the evidence,
you can kill us all and slip out quietly.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.945
Otherwise fuck off, dickwad.

38:43.029 --> 38:46.282
-You're going to pay for this!
-Okay! See you later.

38:47.366 --> 38:48.367
Captain!

38:48.451 --> 38:52.038
He's gone! Mr. Park, hurry up!

38:52.121 --> 38:53.748
Get the bag, we're late!

39:01.130 --> 39:03.090
Mr. Park, hurry up!

39:06.594 --> 39:08.888
A place like this is the safest.

39:08.971 --> 39:11.807
Brilliant idea, Tae-ho!
You're so thoughtful. Well done.

39:11.891 --> 39:16.187
But I'm curious.
What will happen to our girl?

39:16.270 --> 39:17.271
"Our girl"?

39:19.482 --> 39:21.359
It's not ours, and it's not a girl.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.528
Who cares if they blow it up
or melt it down to make teeth?

39:24.612 --> 39:27.907
-Still…
-We're here to make money.

39:28.449 --> 39:30.576
Stay focused.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.505
Just hold out a bit longer.

40:07.446 --> 40:10.491
Hey asshole. I told you, Gate two!

40:11.158 --> 40:13.244
Do you want your pet or not?

40:13.953 --> 40:16.080
Are you new at this?

40:16.747 --> 40:17.832
No bullets?

40:18.874 --> 40:21.043
And you came alone.

40:21.127 --> 40:25.714
Do you trust me, or underestimate me?

40:26.382 --> 40:27.341
Follow me, asshole!

40:36.934 --> 40:38.561
<i>Mr. Park, get ready!</i>

40:41.605 --> 40:45.151
Just speak in Korean, Kang Hyeo-nu.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.736
Don't try any tricks.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.992
-Dorothy first.
-Money first.

40:53.909 --> 40:56.203
Money first!

41:09.175 --> 41:10.468
Is this the correct amount?

41:11.927 --> 41:13.387
Yes! We did it!

41:22.229 --> 41:24.648
What's going on? She's not here.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.444
What's with you guys?

41:30.362 --> 41:31.447
Where'd it go?

41:48.422 --> 41:52.176
<i>Find it quick!</i>
<i>If anyone recognizes it, we're dead!</i>

42:09.318 --> 42:10.653
Kot-nim!

42:26.418 --> 42:27.461
Kot-nim!

42:29.255 --> 42:30.422
Oh, my God.

42:41.308 --> 42:44.061
Calm down! It won't explode. No!

42:48.440 --> 42:49.692
-What's that?
-Look!

42:52.945 --> 42:54.947
Move! Kang Hyeo-nu!

42:55.030 --> 42:58.200
Kot-nim!

42:58.701 --> 43:01.245
Kot-nim!

43:01.328 --> 43:03.247
Kang, where are you? Kang Hyeo-nu!

43:04.081 --> 43:06.166
<i>Hey, Kang! Get back in here!</i>

43:16.677 --> 43:17.845
What just happened?

43:41.493 --> 43:43.662
Why didn't you watch the kid?

43:43.746 --> 43:47.583
Mr. Park, why do you screw up everything?

43:47.666 --> 43:50.419
And why give the money back?
What were you thinking?

43:50.502 --> 43:53.922
And what about you,
freaking out about money in that chaos?

43:54.006 --> 43:54.923
Shit!

43:56.008 --> 43:58.260
I had a bad feeling from the beginning.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.304
You always say that
when things don't work out!

44:00.387 --> 44:01.889
If I'd gone, it might've worked.

44:01.972 --> 44:03.015
Then why didn't you?

44:03.098 --> 44:04.350
I'm just talking to myself.

44:04.433 --> 44:07.519
Hey, forget that,
where's the smartphone? Dial the--

44:10.064 --> 44:11.357
This is why we were caught.

44:11.940 --> 44:13.359
Space Guards were listening in.

44:13.901 --> 44:17.154
I've got the number,
so we'll transmit by radio wave.

44:17.237 --> 44:19.948
The signal won't travel far,
but we'll keep trying until it works.

44:20.032 --> 44:21.575
For now, fly to the Factory.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.369
Ship's down, we can't go.

44:24.536 --> 44:27.164
My two million dollars.

44:27.247 --> 44:30.209
My two million dollars. I'm screwed!

44:31.210 --> 44:33.337
Did you lose your money, Uncle Tae-ho?

44:42.596 --> 44:44.014
It's not done yet.

44:47.059 --> 44:48.018
What's your name?

44:50.562 --> 44:51.689
Kot-nim.

44:51.772 --> 44:53.190
-"Kot-nim"?
-Aren't you Dorothy?

44:53.273 --> 44:55.192
Kot-nim's my Korean name.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.695
"Kot-nim." Pretty name.

44:57.778 --> 44:59.905
"Kot-nim." A bit rustic.

44:59.988 --> 45:01.240
Not as rustic as your name.

45:01.323 --> 45:02.282
Don't call it by name.

45:06.912 --> 45:10.916
-What's wrong, Kot-nim?
-Uncle Tae-ho gets scared when he sees me.

45:15.087 --> 45:17.256
Who's scared? Come here.

45:19.633 --> 45:21.427
Who's scared of our Kot-nim?

45:21.510 --> 45:23.220
Put down that explosive.

45:23.303 --> 45:25.055
Uncle Tiger is more scary.

45:25.556 --> 45:26.432
Big spider!

45:28.350 --> 45:29.768
-Let's get Uncle Tae-ho!
-Gosh.

45:29.852 --> 45:32.229
-Scaredy-cat!
-Jeez, seriously!

45:33.355 --> 45:34.940
Stop it! Stay away!

45:35.023 --> 45:36.483
Don't come near me!

45:37.901 --> 45:39.069
Stay away!

46:20.569 --> 46:22.821
The Black Foxes have a hydrogen bomb.

46:22.905 --> 46:25.073
Many UTS citizens are worried about that.

47:22.130 --> 47:25.384
Pierre, the emergency channel is on.

47:25.467 --> 47:28.595
We love your singing,
but the other ships can all hear you.

47:29.388 --> 47:31.807
-<i>There goes that idiot again!</i>
<i>-Sorry!</i>

47:56.999 --> 47:58.166
Why won't it turn off?

47:59.918 --> 48:01.837
Turn the damn thing off!

48:07.676 --> 48:10.012
He said Captain Jang kissed him.

48:10.095 --> 48:11.889
You think it was just a kiss?

48:11.972 --> 48:14.391
Whatever. Bubs, bring your cash box.

48:14.474 --> 48:15.851
What now?

48:21.356 --> 48:25.110
He stole my money to buy a battery.
My precious money!

48:25.694 --> 48:27.529
We need a welding rod, too.

48:28.322 --> 48:30.198
-We have no credit anymore.
-Whatever.

48:30.282 --> 48:31.950
I just don't get it.

48:32.034 --> 48:34.328
Three adults, and not a penny between you.

48:35.704 --> 48:38.332
We're totally broke.

48:42.169 --> 48:44.463
Uncle Tae-ho, I have a favor to ask.

48:44.546 --> 48:46.340
Can you do it?

48:46.423 --> 48:47.257
No.

48:47.799 --> 48:49.551
I didn't say what it was.

48:49.635 --> 48:52.012
You ask if I can do it
before saying what it is?

48:52.888 --> 48:55.182
-Can I borrow scissors?
-No.

48:59.686 --> 49:03.315
-I have a favor to ask too.
-What is it? I can do it!

49:14.576 --> 49:16.828
Don't do anything. That's my request.

49:16.912 --> 49:19.873
Don't laugh or talk
or draw pictures of us.

49:30.384 --> 49:31.218
Why scissors?

49:38.100 --> 49:39.601
-Careful.
-Of my fingers?

49:39.685 --> 49:41.436
No, the tomatoes.

49:45.857 --> 49:47.859
Hey, I said to stay in the ship!

49:49.528 --> 49:52.781
As soon as I saw these,
I thought of you, Pierre.

49:52.864 --> 49:54.449
I'm always grateful to you.

49:55.242 --> 49:58.161
-Damn, is that a real tomato?
-I've never tasted one myself.

50:02.874 --> 50:04.251
Damn, that's good!

50:09.006 --> 50:11.591
-It's one dollar each.
-"One dollar"!

50:11.675 --> 50:12.759
Please enjoy!

50:13.510 --> 50:14.344
Thank you!

50:15.846 --> 50:17.222
Thank you!

50:18.223 --> 50:20.976
-Two, that's two dollars.
-Two?

50:22.728 --> 50:24.896
We're selling a lot!

50:25.856 --> 50:26.982
Back there!

50:27.774 --> 50:29.067
Don't cut in line.

50:30.819 --> 50:31.820
Have a nice day!

50:33.572 --> 50:35.323
It's gross.

50:35.407 --> 50:36.658
Twenty two, twenty three…

50:48.045 --> 50:49.671
Why are you such a sloppy eater?

50:51.339 --> 50:52.299
Look the other way.

50:53.717 --> 50:54.801
What's with that chuckle?

50:58.013 --> 51:00.098
-Okay.
-I bought a welding rod!

51:04.311 --> 51:06.605
<i>You know Mr. Park?</i>

51:06.688 --> 51:09.649
He used to be the boss of a drug gang.

51:09.733 --> 51:12.486
They say he sold drugs
and helped out poor kids.

51:12.569 --> 51:15.864
He had more money
than he could count, so he'd weigh it.

51:15.947 --> 51:18.241
He even raised a tiger at home!

51:18.325 --> 51:21.328
Captain Jang is smart,
but she's got a filthy temper.

51:21.411 --> 51:24.581
So don't make her angry, got it?

51:24.664 --> 51:27.417
And in her mouth,
she's got a self-destruct…

51:27.501 --> 51:30.545
This is important!

51:30.629 --> 51:32.506
Why's the ship called Victory?

51:32.589 --> 51:35.884
Captain said to pick a good name,
so I wrote it.

51:35.967 --> 51:38.345
I used to think
winning was always a good thing.

51:38.428 --> 51:40.597
What did you do in the past, Sis?

51:41.556 --> 51:42.390
"Sis"?

51:46.812 --> 51:50.023
Oh my! "Sis"? Listen to you.

51:51.900 --> 51:55.654
Actually,
I'm thinking of getting skin grafts.

51:55.737 --> 52:00.283
A black market
full body reconstruction costs 20,000.

52:00.367 --> 52:03.870
But I'm scared people will laugh at me.

52:05.205 --> 52:07.624
Well, that's an excuse.
I don't have the money.

52:10.335 --> 52:11.378
What did I do?

52:11.962 --> 52:15.882
Air-to-air attack,
entering polluted zones,

52:15.966 --> 52:18.135
assassination and so on.

52:21.054 --> 52:24.057
Kid, you're not a…

52:24.141 --> 52:25.225
What?

52:25.308 --> 52:27.269
I'm so envious.

52:27.978 --> 52:32.023
You should’ve said so, you little punk!

52:32.107 --> 52:35.235
But was Uncle Tae-ho always so scary?

52:35.318 --> 52:38.697
Nothing scary about him.
He's just a broke, nasty guy.

52:39.406 --> 52:40.240
Kim Tae-ho…

52:41.825 --> 52:43.785
He's really had no luck.

53:06.433 --> 53:09.019
<i>Tae-ho was a child soldier.</i>

53:09.102 --> 53:11.146
<i>He was a soldier since he was little.</i>

53:11.813 --> 53:14.274
<i>Back then,</i>
<i>he saw a baby for the first time.</i>

53:15.150 --> 53:16.985
<i>He said that she was like an angel.</i>

53:23.950 --> 53:26.786
<i>According to the rules,</i>
<i>he should have sent her to Earth,</i>

53:27.412 --> 53:29.998
<i>but he had some power back then.</i>

53:31.625 --> 53:33.668
Sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry.

53:34.920 --> 53:35.921
She naps at 2 p.m.,

53:36.004 --> 53:38.215
and if she doesn't want milk,
heat up some water.

53:38.298 --> 53:42.636
<i>He spent more and more time</i>
<i>with her, and became a dad.</i>

53:42.719 --> 53:43.678
<i>At age 20.</i>

53:44.179 --> 53:46.264
Don't fall on the stone path.

53:48.600 --> 53:50.393
Su-ni! Su-ni?

53:51.061 --> 53:52.062
Su-ni!

54:02.948 --> 54:03.990
It's my fault.

54:05.992 --> 54:07.535
Daddy will take care of you.

54:08.495 --> 54:12.207
I'll be the best dad in the world.

54:13.250 --> 54:16.378
I'll be a truly good person.

54:23.551 --> 54:27.639
<i>From then on, Tae-ho couldn't hurt anyone.</i>

54:37.524 --> 54:40.860
Su-ni, I wrote this song for you.

54:40.944 --> 54:42.320
Want to hear it?

54:42.404 --> 54:43.989
Can I sing? All right.

54:45.615 --> 54:47.951
<i>Su-ni</i>

54:48.034 --> 54:49.786
<i>I love you</i>

54:50.662 --> 54:54.624
<i>More than anything in the world</i>

54:55.417 --> 54:59.879
<i>I think of you when I'm eating</i>
<i>When I'm putting on my shoes</i>

54:59.963 --> 55:04.467
<i>And even when I'm doing laundry</i>

55:10.390 --> 55:13.101
I didn't violate any rules.
Tell me why I was let go.

55:13.184 --> 55:16.688
Let go! This is so unfair.

55:16.771 --> 55:19.399
<i>The Space Guards let him go</i>
<i>for disobeying orders.</i>

55:20.108 --> 55:24.821
<i>In an instant,</i>
<i>he fell from the very top to the gutter.</i>

55:29.200 --> 55:30.660
What's that?

55:32.495 --> 55:33.997
It's just space debris.

55:38.376 --> 55:41.379
Those are shooting stars.
If you make a wish, it will come true.

55:48.553 --> 55:50.805
<i>After living homeless for a year,</i>

55:51.598 --> 55:53.516
<i>he completely fell apart.</i>

56:53.910 --> 56:56.371
Su-ni, we'll eat like kings tonight!
Let's go.

56:58.206 --> 56:59.249
Su-ni, come here.

57:01.376 --> 57:02.293
Su-ni!

57:04.295 --> 57:05.505
Su-ni!

57:53.803 --> 57:55.013
"Vacate the orbit"?

58:15.783 --> 58:17.577
If you start the search--

58:18.077 --> 58:19.120
I'll pay later.

58:19.746 --> 58:20.580
Wait!

58:27.962 --> 58:31.549
<i>Tae-ho is still searching for Su-ni.</i>

58:33.092 --> 58:35.178
<i>She's waiting in dark space</i>

58:36.888 --> 58:38.681
<i>for her daddy.</i>

58:39.557 --> 58:43.353
Mr. Park, are you using the torque wrench?

58:45.146 --> 58:47.315
Why don't you answer? Mr. Park!

58:48.066 --> 58:49.484
Who said you could use my power?

58:49.567 --> 58:52.737
Something's missing.

58:52.820 --> 58:54.113
Hello.

58:54.197 --> 58:55.573
-Who is this?
-My friend.

58:56.157 --> 58:59.077
-I'm busy, screw off.
-I want to stop.

58:59.160 --> 59:00.703
All right, let's wrap up.

59:02.205 --> 59:03.873
What is it now?

59:05.708 --> 59:07.835
Do I look like a kid?

59:13.716 --> 59:16.427
<i>We've got a call! A call!</i>

59:23.768 --> 59:25.853
Tae-ho! Hurry up!

59:25.937 --> 59:27.188
Should I answer? <i>Hola?</i>

59:27.272 --> 59:28.606
Hurry!

59:38.658 --> 59:40.618
Hello?

59:41.411 --> 59:43.121
<i>District F, by the rail gun base.</i>

59:43.204 --> 59:44.372
Who is it?

59:44.455 --> 59:45.665
<i>In 30 minutes.</i>

59:45.748 --> 59:47.959
No.

59:50.169 --> 59:53.631
Block 27, MR-13, in…

59:54.882 --> 59:56.634
two hours, okay?

59:57.135 --> 59:59.178
<i>I'll wait until you show up.</i>

1:00:00.972 --> 1:00:02.432
-Is it done?
-It's done!

1:00:03.725 --> 1:00:04.684
It's done!

1:00:14.485 --> 1:00:17.363
Go and check the engine.
We'll leave in 30 minutes.

1:00:18.615 --> 1:00:21.159
Where the hell is Captain Jang?

1:00:22.327 --> 1:00:24.579
-Off getting drunk, I'm sure.
-Let's keep Kot-nim.

1:00:26.914 --> 1:00:31.002
Who knows
what the Black Foxes might do to her?

1:00:31.669 --> 1:00:33.046
You know why I live?

1:00:34.172 --> 1:00:35.673
To find Su-ni.

1:00:35.757 --> 1:00:37.884
But soon she'll vacate the orbit.

1:00:38.676 --> 1:00:40.720
Then, not even money will help.

1:00:41.721 --> 1:00:44.349
I need money now, Mr. Park.

1:00:45.183 --> 1:00:49.270
We all need money.

1:01:47.912 --> 1:01:49.747
<i>It's not easy for me, either.</i>

1:01:50.623 --> 1:01:52.875
All those debts.

1:01:52.959 --> 1:01:55.795
Never able to pay them. And Bubs...

1:02:03.761 --> 1:02:05.930
-Kot-nim! Is she there?
-No.

1:02:06.013 --> 1:02:07.557
Kot-nim!

1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:08.933
-Kot-nim!
-Kot-nim!

1:02:09.016 --> 1:02:10.226
-Kot-nim!
-Kot-nim!

1:02:10.727 --> 1:02:12.437
-Kot-nim!
-Kot-nim!

1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:14.063
-Where did she go?
-Kot-nim!

1:02:14.147 --> 1:02:15.189
Kot-nim!

1:02:16.190 --> 1:02:17.150
Kot-nim!

1:02:31.998 --> 1:02:32.957
Kot-nim!

1:02:33.541 --> 1:02:34.751
Uncle!

1:02:35.793 --> 1:02:37.295
-Uncle Tiger!
-Kot-nim!

1:02:37.378 --> 1:02:38.921
<i>Mr. Park, where are you?</i>

1:02:39.005 --> 1:02:40.506
Corridor 17!

1:02:49.557 --> 1:02:50.516
Kot-nim!

1:02:59.358 --> 1:03:01.861
Why do I always seem
to be the only one working?

1:03:10.912 --> 1:03:12.288
Who the hell are you?

1:03:23.090 --> 1:03:24.300
Kot-nim, stay behind me.

1:03:25.885 --> 1:03:27.094
Close your eyes.

1:03:31.057 --> 1:03:32.058
Look at these scums.

1:04:14.809 --> 1:04:15.977
Open your eyes.

1:04:21.566 --> 1:04:22.400
Karum?

1:06:19.809 --> 1:06:20.810
I need to poop.

1:06:30.111 --> 1:06:32.780
Sorry I hit you.
But what were you plotting?

1:06:32.863 --> 1:06:34.740
I should be asking that question.

1:06:34.824 --> 1:06:37.034
-What were you plotting to do with--
-Whatever.

1:06:37.118 --> 1:06:39.787
Go away!
Before Dorothy walks out that door…

1:06:39.870 --> 1:06:42.331
-Let's just forget this happened.
-Don't you give us orders!

1:06:42.415 --> 1:06:44.291
It's not an order, it's a suggestion.

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:47.336
Bubs, if he says one more word,
rip his tongue out.

1:06:49.672 --> 1:06:51.298
That's what you call an order.

1:06:51.382 --> 1:06:54.135
We've both got suspicions here,

1:06:54.969 --> 1:06:56.387
so let's talk it out.

1:07:00.599 --> 1:07:01.976
Should I go first?

1:07:02.852 --> 1:07:05.271
No robot poops.

1:07:06.856 --> 1:07:08.482
Kot-nim is human.

1:07:11.777 --> 1:07:12.903
I knew that.

1:07:17.158 --> 1:07:19.410
I thought she was just too cute.

1:07:19.493 --> 1:07:22.079
Kang Kot-nim,
the daughter of nanorobotics scientist

1:07:22.163 --> 1:07:25.541
Kang Hyeo-nu
at the Mars Terraforming Lab. Right?

1:07:26.459 --> 1:07:28.377
Does Dr. Kang still have the money?

1:07:32.423 --> 1:07:34.425
They're dumber than I thought.

1:07:35.384 --> 1:07:38.054
Kill the light. Lock the door.

1:07:44.727 --> 1:07:48.022
Hey, Black Foxes. We're not done here yet.

1:07:48.647 --> 1:07:52.318
We don't want to hurt you guys.
So tell us.

1:07:53.611 --> 1:07:55.362
What's this all about?

1:09:47.474 --> 1:09:49.476
<i>The Black Foxes aren't terrorists.</i>

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:51.770
We were an environmental organization

1:09:52.479 --> 1:09:55.065
until the Space Guards
tried to kill all of us.

1:09:55.149 --> 1:09:56.984
Now we're the only survivors.

1:09:57.067 --> 1:09:58.402
Stick to the point.

1:10:03.365 --> 1:10:06.327
We've been following
the Mars program from the start.

1:10:06.410 --> 1:10:08.162
Don’t you think it's strange?

1:10:08.704 --> 1:10:12.583
If Mars with its harsh environment
can become green land,

1:10:13.459 --> 1:10:14.960
why not Earth?

1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:23.177
<i>Dorothy was born</i>
<i>with a rare congenital sickness.</i>

1:10:23.677 --> 1:10:26.096
<i>A sickness that ravaged her nerves.</i>

1:10:26.597 --> 1:10:29.642
<i>No cure was available. And no hope.</i>

1:10:30.643 --> 1:10:33.520
<i>As a last resort, Dr. Kang injected</i>
<i>ultra-sophisticated nanobots</i>

1:10:33.604 --> 1:10:36.357
<i>that he had programmed into her body.</i>

1:10:47.368 --> 1:10:51.205
<i>The nanobots were programmed</i>
<i>to signal each other.</i>

1:10:51.288 --> 1:10:56.210
<i>Then the nanobots in Dorothy's body</i>
<i>started to talk with other nanobots.</i>

1:10:56.293 --> 1:11:00.673
<i>Nobody knows how it's possible,</i>
<i>not even Dr. Kang can explain it.</i>

1:11:00.756 --> 1:11:04.218
<i>She even makes flowers blossom</i>
<i>from a dead tree.</i>

1:11:04.718 --> 1:11:09.265
<i>She is the only hope</i>
<i>to bring life back to Earth.</i>

1:11:12.768 --> 1:11:15.896
But Sullivan grabbed Dorothy
and brought her to Mars,

1:11:16.563 --> 1:11:19.149
and the slow progress there
suddenly sped up?

1:11:19.233 --> 1:11:21.735
Yes, that small girl turned Mars
into a fine island.

1:11:21.819 --> 1:11:24.780
A plant was genetically modified
to grow on Mars soil.

1:11:24.863 --> 1:11:27.032
Earth didn't get a chance.
It’s all bullshit.

1:11:27.116 --> 1:11:29.493
The media all broadcast Sullivan’s lies.

1:11:29.576 --> 1:11:32.955
Never mind that.
Kot-nim. What happens to her?

1:11:42.131 --> 1:11:43.924
And Kot-nim ran off
before they killed her.

1:11:44.008 --> 1:11:45.175
But they can’t kill her.

1:11:45.259 --> 1:11:46.844
Dorothy is protected by the nanobots,

1:11:46.927 --> 1:11:50.180
and nanobots can only be killed
at 200 million degrees Celsius.

1:11:50.264 --> 1:11:51.390
The hydrogen bomb…

1:12:13.912 --> 1:12:16.123
Sullivan isn’t the savior of humanity.

1:12:16.206 --> 1:12:19.126
He wants to destroy everything on Earth!

1:12:20.252 --> 1:12:22.087
What is that? What's happening?

1:12:40.189 --> 1:12:41.440
Hurry, let's go!

1:12:41.940 --> 1:12:43.984
Everyone go out by the back door.

1:12:45.736 --> 1:12:47.029
Block 27, MR-13.

1:12:47.112 --> 1:12:49.239
We'll meet Dr. Kang there. See you then.

1:12:49.323 --> 1:12:50.574
Let's use the back door!

1:12:52.076 --> 1:12:52.910
Bubs!

1:12:53.702 --> 1:12:55.120
-Mr. Park, let's go.
-And Kot-nim?

1:12:56.163 --> 1:12:57.247
I'll take her.

1:13:02.711 --> 1:13:04.755
Keep your head up and pass quietly.

1:13:18.435 --> 1:13:19.728
I feel much better.

1:13:20.979 --> 1:13:21.814
What?

1:13:31.407 --> 1:13:32.241
On my back.

1:13:33.784 --> 1:13:34.701
On my back, hurry!

1:13:42.209 --> 1:13:44.586
You sure you want to go inside?
I just took a dump in there.

1:13:45.462 --> 1:13:46.964
Maybe you want to give it a minute?

1:14:31.216 --> 1:14:32.968
Kot-nim, you okay?

1:14:33.051 --> 1:14:36.805
I'm okay. Uncle Tae-ho, are you okay?

1:14:44.188 --> 1:14:45.481
Not okay.

1:14:58.118 --> 1:15:01.205
Don’t worry about Kot-nim,
you take the ship and go.

1:15:01.747 --> 1:15:03.248
Answer me, Captain Jang!

1:15:15.219 --> 1:15:16.637
What the hell? Just a minute.

1:15:20.307 --> 1:15:21.683
You bastards!

1:15:40.869 --> 1:15:42.287
Grab on, Kot-nim!

1:15:56.760 --> 1:15:58.387
Crazy fool, how could you jump?

1:16:10.023 --> 1:16:11.733
Hurry up, Kim Tae-ho.

1:16:16.113 --> 1:16:17.906
Wait, I'll get the harpoon!

1:16:20.659 --> 1:16:22.661
Kot-nim!

1:16:42.139 --> 1:16:43.557
Get up! Let me!

1:16:44.558 --> 1:16:45.809
We're in, let's go!

1:17:04.536 --> 1:17:05.454
Let's go.

1:17:10.667 --> 1:17:11.877
Come on.

1:17:23.055 --> 1:17:24.222
No.

1:17:25.098 --> 1:17:26.308
Oh, my God.

1:17:48.622 --> 1:17:49.915
It's nothing.

1:17:49.998 --> 1:17:53.126
Close your eyes and count to 100.

1:17:56.963 --> 1:17:59.716
Not enough oxygen in the A Bus!
The ventilation is torn!

1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:00.967
The pipes are bursting!

1:18:15.107 --> 1:18:17.442
Thirty-two, thirty-three…

1:18:37.713 --> 1:18:38.588
Everyone come in.

1:18:48.348 --> 1:18:51.226
Seventy-eight, seventy-nine…

1:19:01.194 --> 1:19:04.406
Ninety-five, ninety-six…

1:19:07.993 --> 1:19:10.495
Ninety-nine, one hundred.

1:20:00.003 --> 1:20:01.129
Kot-nim!

1:20:02.214 --> 1:20:03.131
Kot-nim!

1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:05.884
What do we do? Her heart's stopped.

1:20:05.967 --> 1:20:07.761
-You didn't bring the defibrillator?
-What now?

1:20:07.844 --> 1:20:10.722
-Where did it go?
-Come on, we need to stay calm!

1:20:10.806 --> 1:20:13.433
-Calm down, please!
-Can you organize this better?

1:20:13.517 --> 1:20:15.685
-Gently, don't break her ribs!
-One, two.

1:20:16.269 --> 1:20:17.729
Three, four,

1:20:19.689 --> 1:20:20.982
five… Kot-nim!

1:20:21.483 --> 1:20:22.901
Six… Kot-nim!

1:20:24.694 --> 1:20:25.529
Kot-nim!

1:20:32.118 --> 1:20:33.286
Who was that?

1:20:34.871 --> 1:20:35.705
You.

1:20:36.957 --> 1:20:38.750
You fart machine.

1:20:43.171 --> 1:20:44.130
She's a fart machine.

1:20:45.549 --> 1:20:46.550
A fart machine!

1:20:50.637 --> 1:20:52.848
Be honest.
You pooped a little, didn't you?

1:21:01.314 --> 1:21:02.941
-I need the bathroom.
-Go quick!

1:23:19.869 --> 1:23:22.414
Our appointment with Kang
was two hours ago.

1:23:22.497 --> 1:23:26.042
He'll wait. What else can he do?

1:23:26.126 --> 1:23:27.711
Kot-nim is with us.

1:23:28.461 --> 1:23:31.339
Anyway, if we enter
Earth's airspace, it's game over.

1:23:31.423 --> 1:23:33.091
Then Sullivan can't touch us.

1:23:33.758 --> 1:23:37.679
Kang, the Black Foxes, Kot-nim,
Bubs, you, Mr. Park…

1:23:38.263 --> 1:23:40.974
-We'll all meet and descend to Earth.
-No.

1:23:44.602 --> 1:23:45.854
We don't have time to meet up.

1:23:45.937 --> 1:23:49.441
Let's go down now,
before the Space Guards come.

1:23:50.608 --> 1:23:53.445
-Saving Kot-nim comes first.
-How can we go now?

1:23:53.528 --> 1:23:54.904
We need the money first.

1:23:56.573 --> 1:23:58.450
Stop talking nonsense, will you?

1:24:09.335 --> 1:24:11.671
I need to work.
Go up to the Captain's room.

1:24:11.755 --> 1:24:13.798
Uncle Tae-ho, you know what?

1:24:13.882 --> 1:24:17.260
In space, there's no up or down.

1:24:17.343 --> 1:24:21.890
From the universe's viewpoint,
nothing is worthless or precious.

1:24:22.932 --> 1:24:26.227
Everything is precious in its own place.

1:24:27.687 --> 1:24:28.605
Who said that?

1:24:28.688 --> 1:24:30.065
My dad.

1:24:33.985 --> 1:24:37.238
Hey, Kot-nim.
Why didn't you draw a picture of me?

1:24:37.822 --> 1:24:40.158
I drew you first,

1:24:40.241 --> 1:24:42.243
but I was too scared to give it to you.

1:24:48.249 --> 1:24:50.043
I'll put it on the refrigerator.

1:24:52.462 --> 1:24:55.840
Anyway, if you want to draw, do it there.

1:24:56.424 --> 1:24:57.926
Don't cross over. You'll disturb me.

1:24:58.009 --> 1:25:00.303
-Uncle Tae-ho.
-What now?

1:25:00.386 --> 1:25:01.304
Your shoe.

1:25:05.892 --> 1:25:08.186
I know who Su-ni is.

1:25:10.355 --> 1:25:13.149
Later, let's go see her together.

1:25:15.902 --> 1:25:19.197
Even if we don't know where she is,
we can meet her.

1:25:21.991 --> 1:25:24.702
<i>Anybody seen Kot-nim? Anyone?</i>

1:25:24.786 --> 1:25:26.788
<i>I bet she's hiding on me again.</i>

1:25:26.871 --> 1:25:28.081
Mr. Park is looking for you.

1:25:40.885 --> 1:25:42.095
-That's cold!
-Sorry.

1:25:47.100 --> 1:25:48.268
How's that?

1:25:48.351 --> 1:25:49.227
Good.

1:25:50.061 --> 1:25:50.895
Good?

1:25:52.105 --> 1:25:53.982
Shall we wash your hair?

1:25:54.065 --> 1:25:57.819
Your daddy will be mad at us
if your hair's dirty.

1:25:57.902 --> 1:25:59.320
I'll wash it up nice.

1:26:00.363 --> 1:26:02.282
Put a basin underneath!

1:26:09.164 --> 1:26:11.332
That's not the way you do it.

1:26:11.416 --> 1:26:14.878
If you know what's good for you, beat it!

1:26:15.628 --> 1:26:17.505
But you're… Move over.

1:26:18.131 --> 1:26:20.216
That's what you do for babies.

1:26:20.300 --> 1:26:21.551
I'm doing fine!

1:26:21.634 --> 1:26:23.136
-Give it.
-Why push me around?

1:26:23.219 --> 1:26:24.888
-I'll show you.
-Show me what?

1:26:24.971 --> 1:26:27.098
-It will go in her nose.
-No, it won't!

1:26:27.182 --> 1:26:28.391
I know these things!

1:26:29.309 --> 1:26:31.978
-I'm doing fine here!
-Hey, Kot-nim, get up.

1:26:32.061 --> 1:26:33.897
Jeez, seriously.

1:26:33.980 --> 1:26:35.481
Wait, hold on!

1:26:36.941 --> 1:26:39.736
Hey! Stop moving!

1:26:39.819 --> 1:26:42.322
Hey! What's going on here?

1:26:43.031 --> 1:26:43.865
Get out.

1:26:44.407 --> 1:26:46.784
-Why'd you have to show up?
-I said I'd do it!

1:26:46.868 --> 1:26:49.204
Stop fighting and get out!

1:26:49.287 --> 1:26:51.247
-Have you raised a kid?
-I'm going to someday.

1:26:51.331 --> 1:26:53.249
-You don't know anything.
-Don't even talk to me.

1:26:53.333 --> 1:26:55.418
Close your eyes while I shampoo.

1:26:55.501 --> 1:26:58.129
Damn, all this expensive water.

1:26:58.213 --> 1:27:02.634
Uncle Tae-ho's not angry, right?
He wants to get close to me?

1:27:02.717 --> 1:27:03.718
Who knows.

1:27:04.636 --> 1:27:05.720
<i>I see it!</i>

1:27:24.948 --> 1:27:25.990
<i>Hello?</i>

1:27:26.574 --> 1:27:27.825
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Karum?

1:27:28.660 --> 1:27:30.620
<i>Can you hear me? You hear me?</i>

1:27:30.703 --> 1:27:32.038
Yes, I hear you!

1:27:32.747 --> 1:27:34.832
-What about Dr. Kang?
<i>-I just picked him up.</i>

1:27:35.333 --> 1:27:36.793
<i>I am with him now.</i>

1:27:38.044 --> 1:27:39.045
<i>He was here when I came.</i>

1:27:43.216 --> 1:27:44.634
We're going in.

1:27:45.843 --> 1:27:47.512
Karum, is your GPS off?

1:27:47.595 --> 1:27:48.763
<i>It's turned off.</i>

1:27:49.264 --> 1:27:52.100
-Check again to be sure.
-<i>You can't see me in the radar.</i>

1:27:52.725 --> 1:27:54.811
<i>I also used my eyes to drive inside.</i>

1:27:54.894 --> 1:27:58.273
Careful. Let's not screw it up this time.

1:27:58.356 --> 1:27:59.983
Where are we going?

1:28:00.066 --> 1:28:01.401
To see your daddy.

1:28:01.484 --> 1:28:02.652
Daddy?

1:28:03.361 --> 1:28:05.071
My daddy? Really?

1:28:17.250 --> 1:28:19.585
I see you now. I see you.

1:28:39.689 --> 1:28:41.858
-Daddy!
-Kot-nim!

1:28:41.941 --> 1:28:43.526
-Daddy!
-Kot-nim!

1:28:52.910 --> 1:28:55.997
I'm sorry, Kot-nim. I'm sorry.

1:28:58.875 --> 1:29:00.376
Have you been eating okay?

1:29:00.460 --> 1:29:04.547
I'm full, Captain gave me
yummy food with hot sauce.

1:29:04.630 --> 1:29:08.551
Bubs put makeup on me,
but it all rubbed off.

1:29:09.218 --> 1:29:13.973
Uncle Tiger sewed up my socks
and washed my hair.

1:29:15.016 --> 1:29:18.936
Uncle Tae-ho and I earned 23 dollars.

1:29:20.355 --> 1:29:22.106
Thank you.

1:29:43.461 --> 1:29:44.504
Come here a second.

1:29:47.757 --> 1:29:49.967
-Where's the money?
-It's in the ship.

1:29:51.344 --> 1:29:54.305
-It's two million dollars, right?
-Of course. You like money too much.

1:29:54.389 --> 1:29:56.432
What do you mean?
We need to check these things.

1:29:56.933 --> 1:29:59.352
Stop, already. Now's not the time.

1:30:00.061 --> 1:30:02.897
It didn't feel right
with the small kid here.

1:30:02.980 --> 1:30:06.484
-Just put it in a bag! This is your job.
-Since when am I in charge of money?

1:30:06.567 --> 1:30:09.529
You're frustrating me.
Just go bring the money.

1:30:09.612 --> 1:30:11.906
-What's so hard about it?
-Take your conversation outside.

1:30:22.667 --> 1:30:23.626
EMP mines!

1:30:38.933 --> 1:30:40.101
Start the engine.

1:30:42.562 --> 1:30:43.521
Bubs!

1:31:05.835 --> 1:31:07.795
Daddy!

1:31:07.879 --> 1:31:10.006
-Kot-nim!
-Daddy!

1:31:14.719 --> 1:31:15.761
Daddy!

1:31:16.762 --> 1:31:17.763
Kot-nim!

1:31:20.683 --> 1:31:22.977
Kot-nim!

1:31:23.519 --> 1:31:24.979
Daddy!

1:31:57.970 --> 1:31:58.846
No!

1:32:50.773 --> 1:32:52.984
Mr. Park, Bubs, Tae-ho…

1:32:54.735 --> 1:32:55.820
I'm sorry about this.

1:37:24.296 --> 1:37:26.048
I’m one, so I’ll take 400,000.

1:37:32.137 --> 1:37:33.305
Why don't you take it?

1:37:34.807 --> 1:37:35.724
That money is dirty.

1:37:35.808 --> 1:37:36.934
Forget it, then.

1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:39.854
Captain and Bubs can take your share.

1:37:39.937 --> 1:37:41.856
I don't need money from selling Kot-nim.

1:37:41.939 --> 1:37:43.732
What about this month's interest?

1:37:44.525 --> 1:37:46.819
Fuel costs. Oxygen. Water.

1:37:46.902 --> 1:37:48.779
Insurance and the non-citizen tax?

1:37:49.864 --> 1:37:51.282
The bank owns this ship.

1:37:52.032 --> 1:37:54.285
But you don't need money?

1:37:55.035 --> 1:37:57.955
Let's be honest,
we'll never earn anything.

1:37:58.038 --> 1:38:00.416
The more we work, the more debts we have.

1:38:01.500 --> 1:38:04.128
Can't leave quite yet.
Kot-nim's in the Factory.

1:38:04.211 --> 1:38:05.462
-Park.
-It's too far.

1:38:05.546 --> 1:38:07.172
-So we need to warm up the engine.
-Park.

1:38:07.256 --> 1:38:09.466
I'll sit at the control panel,
and Captain can drive.

1:38:09.550 --> 1:38:11.385
If you go there, you'll die, idiot!

1:38:12.970 --> 1:38:15.347
I don't care if I die.

1:38:17.057 --> 1:38:19.310
Tae-ho, you have something to do.

1:38:20.144 --> 1:38:21.937
We do, too.

1:38:22.021 --> 1:38:22.855
Go.

1:38:24.481 --> 1:38:25.566
Go find Su-ni.

1:39:10.235 --> 1:39:11.528
It's 400,000 dollars.

1:39:51.235 --> 1:39:55.197
WRITING KOREAN
KIM SU-NI

1:39:57.491 --> 1:39:59.535
SU-NI,
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

1:39:59.618 --> 1:40:01.954
I THINK OF YOU WHEN I'M EATING

1:40:05.833 --> 1:40:09.044
HELLO
NICE TO MEET YOU

1:40:20.347 --> 1:40:23.017
DADDY, SU-NI LOVES YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

1:40:23.100 --> 1:40:25.811
I LOVE YOU WHEN I'M EATING
WHEN I'M PUTTING ON MY SHOES

1:40:25.894 --> 1:40:28.981
AND EVEN WHEN I'M DOING LAUNDRY
I WILL BECOME A GOOD PERSON LIKE YOU

1:40:34.028 --> 1:40:34.862
Don't move!

1:40:34.945 --> 1:40:37.322
Why's your hand under the table?
Who are you?

1:40:52.337 --> 1:40:53.297
Daddy.

1:40:53.380 --> 1:40:54.757
Go play outside.

1:40:56.008 --> 1:40:57.801
I wrote this.

1:40:57.885 --> 1:40:59.136
Go buy something to eat.

1:41:15.778 --> 1:41:20.324
I WILL BECOME A GOOD PERSON LIKE YOU

1:41:31.376 --> 1:41:34.421
They were all so hot on money.
Now they're throwing it away?

1:41:34.505 --> 1:41:36.423
Isn't it crazy?

1:41:36.507 --> 1:41:38.967
-Huh? What are you doing?
-It is crazy.

1:41:39.843 --> 1:41:42.346
Mr. Park! Fill the rest of the fuel rods.

1:41:43.263 --> 1:41:44.098
Tae-ho?

1:41:47.976 --> 1:41:49.645
Just remembered a promise I made.

1:41:50.229 --> 1:41:52.523
-What promise?
-What are you doing in my seat?

1:41:53.107 --> 1:41:54.108
Move over!

1:42:14.503 --> 1:42:15.838
Let's go, damn it!

1:42:41.405 --> 1:42:42.573
Let's go.

1:43:11.351 --> 1:43:12.561
Too many of them.

1:43:25.699 --> 1:43:26.992
Close the valve!

1:43:36.251 --> 1:43:38.086
Bubs, knock out a few.

1:44:26.343 --> 1:44:29.221
Almost there, Bubs. Just a bit longer.

1:44:40.816 --> 1:44:41.858
My harpoon!

1:44:42.776 --> 1:44:43.610
Damn!

1:44:59.001 --> 1:45:01.420
Nice work, Bubs.
We're in the clear now.

1:45:13.765 --> 1:45:15.017
It never ends.

1:45:21.898 --> 1:45:24.318
Mr. Park, this is my last request.

1:45:25.944 --> 1:45:28.947
-Finish the job before we go back up.
-"Go back up"?

1:45:32.409 --> 1:45:33.618
What's he doing?

1:45:36.121 --> 1:45:37.706
Kim Tae-ho, you're insane!

1:46:01.271 --> 1:46:02.356
Mr. Park, please.

1:46:02.856 --> 1:46:04.483
It's done!

1:46:07.944 --> 1:46:09.404
It's done! All done.

1:46:19.623 --> 1:46:21.083
It's done!

1:46:33.011 --> 1:46:34.137
Mr. Park, now!

1:47:20.767 --> 1:47:23.145
<i>Tae-ho, know where you're going?</i>

1:47:23.228 --> 1:47:24.813
<i>Doesn't look like it.</i>

1:47:24.896 --> 1:47:26.898
<i>Don't think. Just step on it!</i>

1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:52.883
Is that a bomb?

1:47:56.219 --> 1:47:58.722
If that goes off, we're finished.

1:48:07.689 --> 1:48:08.899
Captain?

1:48:09.483 --> 1:48:12.235
-How've you been?
-Kot-nim!

1:48:13.820 --> 1:48:14.654
Kot-nim!

1:48:15.322 --> 1:48:17.616
Uncle Tiger, what about my dad?

1:48:18.867 --> 1:48:20.118
He had to go to work.

1:48:29.211 --> 1:48:30.837
-"Krypton."
-Is Kot-nim crying?

1:48:45.644 --> 1:48:48.980
Captain, keep working,
but Kot-nim should go.

1:48:49.064 --> 1:48:50.315
It won't do any good.

1:48:51.483 --> 1:48:55.028
If the bomb explodes, a 5,000 km wave
of krypton will be released.

1:48:55.529 --> 1:48:58.156
-It will destroy all nanobots.
-What?

1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:00.075
Kot-nim, come on!

1:49:00.158 --> 1:49:03.537
Even if she survives,

1:49:04.079 --> 1:49:05.497
she'll get sick again.

1:49:06.331 --> 1:49:08.083
And forget about restoring Earth.

1:49:08.166 --> 1:49:10.293
What do you mean?
You said you'd stop the explosion.

1:49:10.877 --> 1:49:13.463
-Can't you do anything, Captain?
-I can't do anything.

1:49:14.214 --> 1:49:16.967
The detonator's on the inside.
If I hack in, it will explode.

1:49:18.134 --> 1:49:20.345
Nothing can stop it.

1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:23.640
And the Factory will fall to Earth.

1:49:26.017 --> 1:49:27.352
There's nothing we can do.

1:49:27.936 --> 1:49:30.230
Captain, how can you give up now?

1:49:30.313 --> 1:49:32.983
Try something. Anything!

1:49:33.483 --> 1:49:34.526
If we go far away…

1:49:35.944 --> 1:49:37.153
If Kot-nim

1:49:38.029 --> 1:49:39.948
is very far away from the explosion,

1:49:41.700 --> 1:49:43.076
can she live?

1:49:43.159 --> 1:49:44.619
If she escapes the krypton wave.

1:49:44.703 --> 1:49:47.706
-How far?
-5132.463 km.

1:49:58.133 --> 1:49:59.217
There's no other way.

1:50:00.802 --> 1:50:02.137
I'm okay with it.

1:50:06.182 --> 1:50:07.100
Take Kot-nim.

1:50:08.351 --> 1:50:11.104
-Kot-nim.
-We don't have much time.

1:50:11.187 --> 1:50:12.897
I'll go as fast as I can.

1:50:15.483 --> 1:50:16.818
Uncle Tae-ho!

1:50:35.420 --> 1:50:38.340
Listen to me. Our ship is that way.

1:50:38.423 --> 1:50:39.507
Go wait there.

1:50:39.591 --> 1:50:41.217
And you?

1:50:41.301 --> 1:50:44.471
I'll take everyone and come soon, okay?

1:50:46.973 --> 1:50:48.266
Touch her, and you're dead.

1:51:09.037 --> 1:51:10.080
Kot-nim!

1:51:11.164 --> 1:51:12.749
Step aside, ordinary folk.

1:51:15.418 --> 1:51:17.545
This one's more than you can handle.

1:51:20.215 --> 1:51:21.049
Mr. Park!

1:51:39.109 --> 1:51:39.984
Mr. Park!

1:52:35.540 --> 1:52:37.000
I knew you'd grab on.

1:52:37.083 --> 1:52:39.294
Now it's my turn!

1:52:52.557 --> 1:52:54.434
A present. It will be hot.

1:52:54.517 --> 1:52:57.270
It really is hot. It really is a hand!

1:52:57.979 --> 1:53:01.232
Thanks Mr. Park, I mean Tiger Park!

1:53:02.859 --> 1:53:04.694
<i>Take it off slowly.</i>

1:53:04.778 --> 1:53:06.279
<i>There's no time, dammit!</i>

1:53:06.362 --> 1:53:08.490
<i>You want it slowly, or quickly?</i>

1:53:22.712 --> 1:53:24.881
Captain, call Pierre!

1:53:24.964 --> 1:53:27.008
<i>He came last time!</i>

1:53:27.884 --> 1:53:29.010
The emergency channel.

1:53:30.512 --> 1:53:32.138
Mr. Park, the channel is on, right?

1:53:32.222 --> 1:53:33.556
Emergency channel!

1:53:33.640 --> 1:53:35.892
<i>KOR SH 7901, Victory.</i>

1:53:35.975 --> 1:53:37.477
It's already on.

1:53:37.560 --> 1:53:41.147
Current location, inside the Factory.
You all heard what Sullivan said?

1:53:41.231 --> 1:53:42.607
We heard everything!

1:53:42.690 --> 1:53:45.151
We need to go help Captain Jang!

1:53:45.693 --> 1:53:48.780
<i>Help me? I don't think you get it.</i>

1:53:48.863 --> 1:53:50.198
Listen up, everyone.

1:53:51.199 --> 1:53:54.619
<i>Soon, the Factory will fall to Earth.</i>

1:53:55.370 --> 1:54:00.083
<i>Right on the heads</i>
<i>of your family members on Earth.</i>

1:54:00.583 --> 1:54:03.461
<i>This isn't an accident,</i>
<i>or a terrorist attack.</i>

1:54:03.962 --> 1:54:05.588
<i>All you sweepers,</i>

1:54:06.297 --> 1:54:08.258
<i>if you want to live then run away,</i>

1:54:08.341 --> 1:54:09.175
<i>otherwise…</i>

1:54:10.134 --> 1:54:11.219
Come and fight.

1:54:12.262 --> 1:54:13.888
<i>I'll help you all.</i>

1:54:22.021 --> 1:54:24.315
<i>Five thousand kilometers.</i>
<i>Tae-ho, there's no time!</i>

1:54:24.399 --> 1:54:26.734
Victory, please hold together.

1:54:26.818 --> 1:54:29.112
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if the ship can last that long.</i>

1:54:38.371 --> 1:54:41.040
-Pierre.
-Captain Jang! It's me!

1:54:41.541 --> 1:54:43.001
I'll do anything.

1:54:44.752 --> 1:54:48.131
Listen to that lover boy.
Doesn't he get the situation?

1:54:55.680 --> 1:54:57.140
<i>Mr. Park, is it done?</i>

1:54:57.223 --> 1:54:58.766
<i>It's done, all done.</i>

1:54:58.850 --> 1:55:01.019
<i>Stop acting pitiful</i>
<i>and get down here! Tiger Park!</i>

1:55:05.773 --> 1:55:07.191
Move over, Pierre!

1:55:44.145 --> 1:55:46.189
Space sweepers, let's see what you got.

1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:34.737
<i>Damn! I almost lost it there.</i>

1:56:35.530 --> 1:56:36.364
<i>Shit!</i>

1:56:49.585 --> 1:56:51.129
<i>One's on our tail.</i>

1:57:02.390 --> 1:57:03.224
<i>Got you, bastard!</i>

1:57:33.463 --> 1:57:34.338
Please…

1:57:35.715 --> 1:57:37.550
Kot-nim? Is she okay?

1:57:37.633 --> 1:57:39.218
<i>Yes, don't worry.</i>

1:57:39.927 --> 1:57:43.014
She's safe inside the container.

1:58:34.732 --> 1:58:35.650
Captain Jang!

1:58:38.194 --> 1:58:40.154
-Captain Jang!
-Captain Jang!

1:59:02.927 --> 1:59:03.761
It's too slow.

1:59:03.845 --> 1:59:06.639
Mr. Park. Burn the last of our fuel
and hit the booster!

1:59:06.722 --> 1:59:09.392
The emergency booster
will only give you 20 seconds!

1:59:09.475 --> 1:59:10.685
That's enough.

1:59:12.562 --> 1:59:13.688
Won't anything go right?

1:59:13.771 --> 1:59:16.357
Bubs! Release the gear
for the emergency booster!

1:59:21.696 --> 1:59:22.530
Bubs!

2:00:48.407 --> 2:00:49.450
Tae-ho.

2:00:58.042 --> 2:01:01.128
Captain Jang, Mr. Park, Bubs.

2:01:03.381 --> 2:01:04.966
Thank you for everything.

2:01:05.549 --> 2:01:07.468
I was happy

2:01:08.511 --> 2:01:09.595
with you guys.

2:01:09.679 --> 2:01:12.265
You know that I love you all?

2:01:42.169 --> 2:01:43.170
Kot-nim

2:01:45.256 --> 2:01:46.757
isn't here, you fucking loser.

2:01:47.758 --> 2:01:51.637
<i>We can't stop it from exploding.</i>
<i>So let's take the bomb and run.</i>

2:01:51.721 --> 2:01:53.597
<i>And leave Kot-nim in the Factory?</i>

2:01:53.681 --> 2:01:55.224
Captain Jang! It's me!

2:01:55.308 --> 2:01:59.020
<i>Before we fly out,</i>
<i>we'll give Kot-nim to Pierre.</i>

2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:01.647
Where are you going without me?

2:02:01.731 --> 2:02:03.983
We have to go to work too.

2:02:05.609 --> 2:02:08.571
<i>Hide Kot-nim, and take the bomb with us?</i>

2:02:08.654 --> 2:02:10.156
<i>Then we'll all die together?</i>

2:02:10.239 --> 2:02:11.490
<i>There's no other way.</i>

2:02:12.074 --> 2:02:14.076
Goodbye, Kot-nim.

2:02:20.458 --> 2:02:22.710
<i>It needs to explode 5,000 km away.</i>

2:02:23.210 --> 2:02:24.670
<i>Then Kot-nim will be safe.</i>

2:02:25.921 --> 2:02:28.549
<i>And then she can save the Earth.</i>

2:02:35.097 --> 2:02:36.182
Let's go together.

2:04:29.587 --> 2:04:32.381
-What about Bubs?
<i>-Fine. The head at least.</i>

2:04:33.966 --> 2:04:35.593
<i>The repair fee will be insane.</i>

2:04:36.218 --> 2:04:38.762
<i>And what was that?</i>
<i>"Thanks for everything"?</i>

2:04:39.889 --> 2:04:42.099
<i>"I was happy with you guys"?</i>

2:04:42.683 --> 2:04:44.810
<i>"You know that I love you all"?</i>

2:04:44.894 --> 2:04:47.646
You all are so corny.

2:05:03.412 --> 2:05:08.709
VICTORY

2:05:40.574 --> 2:05:42.201
Long time no see, Porky.

2:05:45.037 --> 2:05:47.373
-Who are…
-I'm hurt.

2:05:47.456 --> 2:05:49.041
You don't recognize Bubs?

2:05:51.710 --> 2:05:52.878
Porky, that idiot.

2:05:58.592 --> 2:06:00.386
-Pay up.
-Yes, pay up!

2:06:01.512 --> 2:06:04.181
For what we did today. Pay us.

2:06:05.891 --> 2:06:06.725
Right.

2:07:28.515 --> 2:07:30.893
Daddy, I finished writing.

2:07:30.976 --> 2:07:32.102
You did?

2:07:34.229 --> 2:07:35.481
Then show me.

2:07:36.106 --> 2:07:38.108
WRITING KOREAN

2:07:47.534 --> 2:07:48.702
You wrote so well.

2:07:57.127 --> 2:07:58.003
Su-ni,

2:07:59.421 --> 2:08:00.798
give me a hug?

2:08:06.261 --> 2:08:09.598
Sorry I'm so late.

2:08:12.226 --> 2:08:15.396
Thanks so much for coming to me.

2:08:20.651 --> 2:08:23.112
Bye, Daddy.

2:08:39.670 --> 2:08:42.840
You're slacking off, kid.
Need to get you another tutor.

2:08:42.923 --> 2:08:44.758
-Right.
-Stop freaking out, you two.

2:08:44.842 --> 2:08:48.137
We're not freaking out.
She's a first grader now.

2:08:48.804 --> 2:08:52.766
Look at all the other moms.
They hire five tutors for their kids.

2:08:52.850 --> 2:08:55.060
-That's right.
-Want her to fall behind and resent you?

2:08:55.144 --> 2:08:57.187
I'm not saying she should do nothing.

2:08:57.730 --> 2:09:00.524
Hey, Kot-nim! Want another tutor?

2:09:01.275 --> 2:09:02.735
Of course she doesn't!

2:09:02.818 --> 2:09:04.778
<i>People keep complimenting my voice.</i>

2:09:04.862 --> 2:09:06.572
And this one is nice.

2:09:06.655 --> 2:09:09.825
<i>I enjoy singing ballads.</i>

2:09:09.908 --> 2:09:10.826
What do you think?

2:09:11.326 --> 2:09:13.954
I don't like them. I like your voice now.

2:09:16.290 --> 2:09:20.127
Still, pick one. I can't keep this voice.

2:09:22.337 --> 2:09:24.631
<i>We've become a new family.</i>

2:09:25.132 --> 2:09:28.135
<i>Sometimes I go to Earth to make trees.</i>

2:09:28.635 --> 2:09:31.180
<i>Captain has stopped drinking.</i>

2:09:31.263 --> 2:09:36.977
<i>Bubs is a real girl now,</i>
<i>and she wants to get cultured.</i>

2:09:37.060 --> 2:09:42.274
<i>Uncle Tiger erased his tattoos</i>
<i>so he won't scare my friends.</i>

2:09:42.858 --> 2:09:46.445
<i>And Uncle Tae-ho</i>
<i>bought ten pairs of shoes.</i>

2:09:47.362 --> 2:09:50.240
<i>I think Daddy must be happy in heaven.</i>

2:09:50.324 --> 2:09:56.330
LIFE AND SONGS

2:09:58.207 --> 2:10:01.710
Damn it! How am I supposed to read?

2:10:01.794 --> 2:10:04.004
What are they doing in our territory?

2:10:04.087 --> 2:10:05.380
Start the engine.

2:10:05.923 --> 2:10:07.633
We'll get 400 dollars for those.

2:10:18.352 --> 2:10:21.230
Let's go make some money!

2:16:19.379 --> 2:16:24.384
