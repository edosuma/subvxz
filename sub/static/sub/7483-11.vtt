00:04.672 --> 00:07.740
¶ ¶

00:15.783 --> 00:18.083
I got a suspicious package
on a bench.

00:18.085 --> 00:19.251
Requesting backup
for containment

00:19.253 --> 00:20.719
while I check it out.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.796
Daddy, I found it.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.233
(alarm sounds)

00:34.235 --> 00:37.369
I've got mall security in
pursuit of a couple, uh, Santas.

00:47.782 --> 00:50.215
Hey! Stop!

00:52.153 --> 00:54.086
LAPD! Stop!

00:56.057 --> 00:58.290
LAPD!

00:58.292 --> 00:59.825
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:59.827 --> 01:01.593
Drop your weapon!

01:01.595 --> 01:03.162
Release the woman
now!

01:08.169 --> 01:10.269
(woman gasps)

01:44.271 --> 01:48.273
Wow. What are
you mad about?

01:48.275 --> 01:50.642
I'm not mad.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.644
Just bombed that bag with
a spinning back kick.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.646
That is a pure
aggression release.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.415
Trying different
techniques.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.516
You hate spinning back kicks.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.517
You say they're impractical.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.352
They are impractical.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.687
It's like side control
in grappling.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.222
It may work on pay-per-view.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.190
Try that on the street,
I'll bite your ear off.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.558
(chuckles)
(beeps)

02:06.560 --> 02:08.227
(sighs)

02:08.229 --> 02:09.895
I'm going to San Francisco
for the holidays.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.231
That's great.
That's what you wanted.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.298
I wanted
to spend Christmas

02:13.300 --> 02:14.566
with my beautiful wife
and daughter.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.568
You know, nice hotel.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.504
Good food,
see the sights.

02:18.506 --> 02:19.671
Just the three of us.

02:19.673 --> 02:20.839
What about Aidan?

02:20.841 --> 02:23.175
He's cold-weather training
in Virginia.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.776
Didn't come home
for Thanksgiving.

02:24.778 --> 02:28.280
He's working his ass off
to become a cadet sergeant.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.414
I'm proud of him.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.216
But I haven't seen him
in three months.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.217
Well, boy is focused.

02:32.219 --> 02:33.619
Just like his old man.
Yeah.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.420
He's in high school,
supposed to have fun.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.422
You know what I was doing
at that age?

02:37.424 --> 02:39.758
Nothing you want your son doing,
I can promise you that.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.527
Hey, what, uh,
what hotel you staying at?

02:41.529 --> 02:44.696
Oh, Michelle's sister bought
a pied-à-terre.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.365
Sounds nice.
Sounds small.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.200
She says "pied-à-terre."

02:48.202 --> 02:49.701
I say the kitchen's
in the bedroom.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.703
Hold on a second.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.372
She wants you
to stay there with them?

02:53.374 --> 02:54.873
All three of us.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.241
And Michelle's sister.

02:56.243 --> 02:57.609
And Michelle's sister's
three cats.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.811
No, you tell 'em,
"I appreciate the offer,

02:59.813 --> 03:02.347
I think we'd all be a little
more comfortable at a hotel."

03:02.349 --> 03:03.348
That's all.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.267
(chuckles)
Yeah, sure.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.185
Tell my wife I don't want
to stay with her baby sister.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.188
Exactly, be totally
honest with her.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.323
The level to which you
don't understand marriage

03:11.325 --> 03:13.258
is astounding.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.259
(bell rings)

03:14.261 --> 03:15.727
Round's over,
we caught a case.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.396
Perfect timing.
Saved by the Beale.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.499
I know you're the kind of guy
who likes to improve

03:20.501 --> 03:22.501
in all areas
at all times.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.703
It is my job
to dole out advice.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.305
(sighs)
On all topics.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.511
Granger's still not back?

03:32.513 --> 03:37.549
No, his recovery is taking
a little longer than expected.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.284
This morning

03:39.286 --> 03:41.286
thieves hit an office
in Sherman Oaks,

03:41.288 --> 03:43.655
and they set
a server room on fire.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.825
The office belongs to a
cyber-security company,

03:46.827 --> 03:48.994
See Bug Systems.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.662
They were closed
for the holidays.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.664
See Bug's founder,
Peter Weber,

03:52.666 --> 03:55.234
is an expert in the
field of anti-malware,

03:55.236 --> 03:56.768
or malicious
software.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.605
Malware can be designed
to breach government computers,

03:59.607 --> 04:02.007
secure servers,
even power plants.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.376
It's basically the terrorism
of the Internet.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.311
NELL:
Which is exactly why

04:06.313 --> 04:08.313
the Department of Defense
needs people like Weber.

04:08.315 --> 04:09.448
They've recently began
vetting him

04:09.450 --> 04:11.283
to help fight foreign
cyber attacks.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.452
And now DoD wants to ensure
that nothing harmful

04:13.454 --> 04:15.654
against national security has
been taken from the office.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.489
What about the guy
LAPD arrested?

04:17.491 --> 04:18.824
Mmm, Billy Rex.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.325
He grew up
in the system.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.327
Ventura Youth
Correctional.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.830
He did postgrad studies
at Norco Prison.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.932
This guy has been
charged for everything,

04:26.934 --> 04:28.300
from assault
to armed robbery.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.302
This guy goes
from strong-arm robberies

04:30.304 --> 04:32.537
to stealing computer viruses?

04:32.539 --> 04:33.872
They find
anything on him?

04:33.874 --> 04:35.774
A nine millimeter, that's it.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.276
Which means
whatever they stole was

04:37.278 --> 04:38.377
in the other two Santas' bags.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.162
And unfortunately,

04:40.163 --> 04:41.946
the Santa beards make
facial rec impossible.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.815
LAPD is currently
transporting him

04:43.817 --> 04:45.350
to the boatshed for questioning.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.818
We'll hit
Weber's office.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.687
Kensi, Deeks, why don't you,
uh, talk to Rex.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.422
Find out what
he was looking for.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.958
Not so fast, Mr. Callen.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.027
I think it's best

04:55.029 --> 04:57.596
if you and Mr. Hanna stayed
away from the crime scene.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.697
Why's that?

04:58.699 --> 05:02.901
Mr. Beale, play the rest
of the footage.

05:11.312 --> 05:12.444
Hold on, stop that.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.413
Zoom in.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.415
SAM:
Joelle.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.416
Joelle? What
do you mean?

05:17.418 --> 05:19.418
Like,
Callen's Joelle?

05:19.420 --> 05:22.421
She sent me a text to call her,
but I never got back to her.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.589
HETTY: The LAPD reports
that she's doing fine.

05:24.591 --> 05:29.061
Just steer clear of her
until the case is resolved.

05:29.063 --> 05:32.664
Both of you have
a cover to maintain.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.000
We'll question Billy Rex
in the boatshed.

05:47.781 --> 05:51.450
You know, we should probably,
uh, interview Joelle.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.618
About the case, right?

05:53.620 --> 05:55.087
Yeah, no, that, too.
Yeah.

05:55.089 --> 05:57.622
That's her.

05:57.624 --> 05:58.790
Joelle Taylor?

05:58.792 --> 05:59.958
Thank you, Tony.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.960
Hi, I'm Detective
Marty Deeks, LAPD.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.061
This is my partner,

06:03.063 --> 06:04.996
Kensi Blye, NCIS.
Hi.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.065
Hello. Um, who did
you say you worked for?

06:07.067 --> 06:09.067
Oh, we're, uh,
federal agents.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.068
Please, have a seat.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.737
Okay.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.372
Sorry all of this
happened to you.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.373
How are you?

06:14.375 --> 06:15.724
I'm fine.

06:15.725 --> 06:17.074
I'm just glad
the police caught the guy.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.444
We're looking into
the case right now.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.879
Did you see anything
that might help us

06:20.881 --> 06:22.114
track the guys
that got away?

06:22.116 --> 06:24.149
Well, I told the police,
I didn't see much.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.151
I-I heard the alarm,
and then I saw the Santas...

06:26.153 --> 06:29.087
the men running-- I didn't know
what was happening.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.390
Do you have any idea where
they might have gone to?

06:31.392 --> 06:32.891
Well, they ran
into the lower level

06:32.893 --> 06:34.159
of the parking garage
over there.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.794
And that's when
the other guy grabbed me.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.597
All right, thank you,
that was very helpful.

06:40.033 --> 06:44.403
So, uh, Preston's is a pretty
high-end men's clothing line.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.171
(laughing):
Deeks.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.640
Yeah, I was here buying a
Christmas gift for my boyfriend.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.708
Oh, cool, what'd
you get him?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.646
I-I bought him
a dress shirt and a tie.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.981
He's a securities
trader.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.482
I don't really know
what that is,

06:57.484 --> 07:00.485
but he's got to wear
a suit every day.

07:00.487 --> 07:01.820
I think he'll love it.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.623
I'm-I'm sure
that he will.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.124
I know, right?

07:06.126 --> 07:07.459
It's awful.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.894
I mean, who does that?

07:08.896 --> 07:11.496
Buys their, buys
their boyfriend a safe gift.

07:11.498 --> 07:12.497
What is that?

07:12.499 --> 07:13.732
What is, what is a safe gift?

07:13.734 --> 07:15.066
Zero risk.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.568
Something that says
anything but

07:16.570 --> 07:18.503
"you're the most important
person in my world."

07:18.505 --> 07:20.205
DEEKS: Wow, you've obviously
put a lot of thought into this.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.507
Well, I'm good
at the safe gift.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.209
It's a girlfriend thing
I could be better at.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.545
Yeah, I think he's gonna love
the shirt and tie

07:26.547 --> 07:28.013
because it's coming from you.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.682
DEEKS: Not that he
wouldn't enjoy, uh,

07:30.684 --> 07:33.151
you know, like, a leather gym
bag a tad bit more, though.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.653
That's actually
a really good idea.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.821
It is a good idea.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.155
How did you come...?
(cell phone rings)

07:37.157 --> 07:38.523
Oh.

07:38.525 --> 07:39.224
Speak of the devil.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.525
It's my boyfriend.

07:40.527 --> 07:41.526
Wow. Nice
to meet you.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.028
You, too.
Bye.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.563
So glad you got
my message.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.031
You will never believe
what happened to me.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.232
Office.
Yeah, no, definitely. Coming.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.234
CALLEN: What happened?
What's going on?

07:49.236 --> 07:51.903
I was shopping today,
and this crazy guy grabbed me.

07:51.905 --> 07:52.904
But you're okay?

07:52.906 --> 07:53.972
He, uh...

07:53.974 --> 07:55.607
Well, he held a gun to me.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.608
He didn't hurt you?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.610
No, no, I-I'm fine.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.611
Look, uh, Jo, I'm gonna see
what I can do about getting out

08:00.614 --> 08:02.514
of this, uh, meeting
with this investment group.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.482
No. No, Callen, don't.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.016
Really, I'm-I'm fine.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.018
Jo, I-I'd like to
be there for you.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.520
And you will be.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.022
Tonight.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.523
Look, I know how important
those meetings are.

08:11.525 --> 08:14.343
So, go.

08:14.344 --> 08:17.162
Go make some deals or trades
or whatever it is you do.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.497
I'll see you later.

08:18.499 --> 08:19.798
Okay.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.867
I'll see you tonight.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.072
Sounds like she's
holding up well.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.074
Yeah.

08:29.076 --> 08:32.077
Yeah, she's, uh...

08:32.079 --> 08:35.146
she's even worried about me
making my investment meeting.

08:35.148 --> 08:39.117
I missed a few holidays and
birthdays for those "meetings."

08:41.088 --> 08:43.622
Guy put a gun to
Jo's head, Sam.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.790
I want to have a little
talk with him about that.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.659
ERIC:
Hey, guys.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.662
I just got word,
Billy Rex escaped custody.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.565
They were transferring him
to you when this occurred...

09:00.807 --> 09:02.541
He's capable.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.543
And dangerous.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.311
Guy like that's not breaking
into Weber's office

09:06.313 --> 09:08.280
for your standard
smash-and-grab.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.556
MAN: Please don't touch that.
MAN 2: Just doing my job.

09:17.558 --> 09:18.990
Bet that's Weber.
Yeah.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.760
Yeah, there's a lot of...
lot of data, lot of... Yeah?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.194
NCIS. Is there
a problem here?

09:23.196 --> 09:24.880
NCIS, okay, thank you.

09:24.881 --> 09:26.565
It took DoD long enough
to send somebody.

09:26.567 --> 09:29.601
I'm Detective Deeks, this is
my partner Kensi Blye, NCIS.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.386
I'm sorry,
uh, Mr. Weber,

09:31.387 --> 09:33.170
your office was broken into
less than an hour ago.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.173
Yeah,
and in that period of time,

09:35.175 --> 09:39.678
local PD managed to arrest
and lose the only suspect.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.646
This is Billy Rex,
do you recognize him?

09:41.648 --> 09:43.682
No, never seen him.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.151
Uh, any idea
where he's gone?

09:46.153 --> 09:48.019
Well, he has no history
of cyber-crime, so there's

09:48.021 --> 09:50.689
no reason to believe this is
anything but a smash-and-grab.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.123
Can you list the items
that were stolen?

09:52.125 --> 09:53.658
Uh, sure.

09:53.660 --> 09:56.695
I'm missing six tablets,
three laptops, and, uh...

09:57.998 --> 10:00.699
...one<i> Xena: Warrior Princess</i>
leather miniskirt

10:00.701 --> 10:02.734
and matching armored bustier.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.604
Wow, not creepy at all.
Bustier.

10:05.606 --> 10:06.938
It's worth a lot.
I'm sure it is.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.640
So, uh, for a
high-tech company,

10:08.642 --> 10:10.775
the security is pretty...

10:10.777 --> 10:13.278
Uh, well, DoD was set to install
their own security system

10:13.280 --> 10:15.280
upon completion of my review.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.615
After the holidays.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.949
Right.
Do you have any idea

10:17.951 --> 10:19.684
why the thieves would burn
down your server room?

10:19.686 --> 10:21.686
No, I... I
have no idea.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.688
I'd love to get in there
and find out.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.790
I could patch a recovery program

10:25.792 --> 10:27.792
and see whether or not they made
off with any of our malware.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.794
I'm sorry,
did you say<i> your</i> malware?

10:29.796 --> 10:30.895
Yeah.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.063
I thought that
you created systems

10:32.065 --> 10:33.064
to fight against the malware.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.066
(chuckles)
Unbelievable.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.635
You've heard of
the CDC, right?

10:36.637 --> 10:38.770
They have flu viruses
so they can study them,

10:38.772 --> 10:40.705
so they can figure out
how to fight them.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.374
You do the same thing
here with malware.

10:42.376 --> 10:45.043
Yeah.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.646
And the malware
on these servers...

10:47.648 --> 10:50.348
it's the worst
of the worst.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.685
It's the stuff
of nightmares.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.069
Nell, you got eyes on Bill Rex?

11:11.071 --> 11:12.487
(Nell sighs)

11:12.488 --> 11:13.904
Nothing yet.
After he escaped custody,

11:13.907 --> 11:15.974
it's like he just vanished.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.977
But LAPD
says that

11:18.979 --> 11:20.812
he is a known
associate

11:20.814 --> 11:22.313
of a bookie named
Lincoln Tate.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.416
They have an open
investigation on him.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.718
If Rex stole
something valuable
from Weber's office,

11:26.720 --> 11:28.720
Tate would make
the perfect fence.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.689
Oh, and we got a lead
on the other two Santas.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.992
Looks like they escaped
in a 1993 Ford Mustang.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.227
I tracked it to
a motel in West L.A.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.429
CALLEN:
All right. Send Kensi
and Deeks to the motel.

11:37.431 --> 11:38.747
We'll visit this bookie,

11:38.748 --> 11:40.064
see if we can
get a line on Billy Rex.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.466
Got it.
Oh, and I'm sending

11:41.468 --> 11:43.435
Tate's LAPD file
to your phone now.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.404
(sighs)

11:47.374 --> 11:50.008
Talk to me, baby.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.443
Come on.

11:51.445 --> 11:53.978
Tell me something good.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.046
Purr for me.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.114
Daddy's right here.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.317
Show me what you got--
hey.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.985
Was I, um...?

12:00.987 --> 12:02.487
No.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.022
I wasn't talking to myself?

12:04.024 --> 12:05.824
I heard nothing.

12:05.826 --> 12:06.891
Are you sure?

12:06.893 --> 12:08.159
Because sometimes I'm just like,

12:08.161 --> 12:10.028
"Buh, buh, buh, buh..."
Look, I...

12:10.030 --> 12:12.397
Sorry. I have to cancel
our plans for next weekend.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.199
What?

12:14.201 --> 12:15.500
The Christmas Horror
Movie Festival?

12:15.502 --> 12:17.168
We've been talking
about that for weeks.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.404
Yeah.
<i>Jack Frost;</i>
<i>Silent Night, Deadly Night...</i>

12:19.406 --> 12:20.438
<i> Gremlins.</i>

12:20.440 --> 12:22.073
"Bright light, bright light!"

12:22.075 --> 12:23.808
(laughs)
I know.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.443
Tickets are nonrefundable.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.912
So is this plane ticket
I just bought.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.380
What?

12:29.382 --> 12:31.366
Hetty just let me know

12:31.367 --> 12:33.351
I can go home early
to see my family, so...

12:33.353 --> 12:36.020
Hey, that's... that's great.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.156
Of course.
You know, we'll just, um...

12:38.158 --> 12:39.924
we'll rent the movies
when you get back.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.060
Okay.
Okay.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.498
Unless...
Yeah?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.366
I don't know,
maybe you...

12:48.368 --> 12:50.535
want to

12:50.537 --> 12:52.137
come home with me.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.204
Aah!

12:53.206 --> 12:54.472
Oh!

12:54.474 --> 12:56.141
(clears throat)
I'm sorry.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.809
No, uh, don't be.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.477
(computer beeps)

13:01.848 --> 13:04.516
Hey. I'm in.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.551
Okay, so...
I'm searching the servers

13:06.553 --> 13:08.486
that we recovered from See Bug.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.256
At the time of the break-in,
only one file

13:11.258 --> 13:13.858
was downloaded
onto a thumb drive.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.927
860 kilobytes?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.562
That's... not that much.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.198
Huh. No.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.866
But it's enough.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.468
I gotta talk to
Callen and Sam.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.303
Yeah.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.072
What do you got, Eric?

13:28.074 --> 13:29.274
ERIC:
Well, I managed to I.D.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.508
the malware
that the thieves took.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.310
It affects something
called PLCs.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.813
Programmable Logic Controllers.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.381
They're used in
industrial computer systems

13:36.383 --> 13:37.549
to control automation.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.417
What kind of industrial systems?

13:39.419 --> 13:42.053
Well, the specific PLCs
that this malware targets

13:42.055 --> 13:44.923
are only found
in U.S. electric power plants.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.891
Guys, this bug could crash

13:46.893 --> 13:49.160
the entire nation's grid
for weeks.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.528
And no power,
no communications.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.063
No heat.

13:52.065 --> 13:55.466
75 degrees here,
but it's cold everywhere else.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.534
ERIC:
This kind of malware could be

13:56.536 --> 13:58.136
worth millions
to the right buyer.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.972
And millions to the guy
that brokers the deal.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.340
Let's go talk
to our bookie.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.408
Thanks, Eric.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.017
It's pretty
crazy how, uh,

14:13.019 --> 14:15.286
Joelle can't tell Callen
how she feels about him.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.121
Yeah, well, if she
can't get him a gift

14:17.123 --> 14:18.289
that says, "I
care about you,"

14:18.291 --> 14:19.290
how is she gonna have
that conversation?

14:19.292 --> 14:20.875
Just saying,
life's a little short

14:20.876 --> 14:22.459
for that kind
of hopscotch.
Amen to that.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.262
Hey, is your mom still going
on that cruise with her friends?

14:24.264 --> 14:25.897
Yeah. Yeah,
she is.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.866
Will we still get
a couple days off
from, uh, from work?

14:27.868 --> 14:29.200
That's what Hetty
said, thankfully.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.752
Well, I'm thinking about
jumping in the truck,

14:30.753 --> 14:32.303
going up to Mammoth, doing
a little bit of snowboarding.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.005
Oh. That sounds
like fun.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.874
There's a great hotel
up there that takes dogs,

14:35.876 --> 14:37.876
if you want to come.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.410
(laughing):
Wow, okay.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.912
No, I don't mean that you...

14:40.914 --> 14:42.580
I mean that I'm bringing Monty

14:42.582 --> 14:44.082
to Mammoth, and...
Mm-hmm.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.316
...you know,
we talked about it...

14:45.318 --> 14:47.018
(coughs):
and we think you should come.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.588
Okay. I haven't really been
snowboarding in a while, but...

14:50.590 --> 14:51.840
So, yes.

14:51.841 --> 14:53.091
So we got a plan.
We have a plan.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.292
We're going snowboarding.
Up top.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.060
Okay.
Holiday plans.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.061
Mustang.
Mustang.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.030
KENSI:
We should, uh,

14:59.032 --> 15:02.033
probably start...
knocking on doors or...

15:02.035 --> 15:04.202
I got a better idea.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.905
CALLEN:
Beachside office, huh?

15:06.907 --> 15:08.973
SAM:
When in Rome.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.083
<i> Feliz Navidad, hombres.</i>

15:19.085 --> 15:20.218
Agent Callen.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.653
Agent Hanna.

15:21.655 --> 15:23.121
Gonna ask you
a few questions.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.989
Agents, huh?

15:24.991 --> 15:28.026
Here I thought you two were
selling massages by the minute.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.127
(Tate laughing)

15:29.129 --> 15:30.028
Take a walk.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.530
Take a walk.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.168
Okay.

15:39.539 --> 15:43.341
Why you guys coming
at me like this, huh?

15:43.343 --> 15:44.542
We're gonna ask you
a few questions,

15:44.544 --> 15:45.960
and your answers
are going to determine

15:45.961 --> 15:47.377
whether or not you get
to lay there all day

15:47.380 --> 15:48.980
or you wind up in some hole
down at Guantanamo.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.281
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back that up.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.583
Back that up, okay?

15:52.585 --> 15:53.651
I'm a bookie,
brothers.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.086
A patriot.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.288
If serving my country
means serving me,

15:57.290 --> 15:59.390
ask and I shall answer.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.994
Guy who works for you...
Billy Rex?

16:02.996 --> 16:05.029
He robbed someone
he shouldn't have.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.965
Rex is dead to me.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.234
He was my top guy
for almost ten years

16:10.236 --> 16:12.070
but was getting restless.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.273
He started, like,
searching for side jobs.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.975
Bigger risk.
Bigger reward.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.142
And?

16:18.144 --> 16:20.578
And last week he takes off.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.113
Disappears.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.749
Same day,
my accountant calls me up

16:24.751 --> 16:27.418
and he says he's found something
wrong with my money.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.420
We set up a meet...

16:29.422 --> 16:30.722
he doesn't show up.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.290
My guys find him dead
a few days later.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.592
You think Rex did it.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.127
I'm not the kind of guy

16:36.129 --> 16:37.328
who believes in coincidences.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.664
Tell us where Rex is.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.499
We'll take care of him for you.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.101
(laughs)

16:43.103 --> 16:45.169
Yeah, you know, uh,
I would if I could.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.472
But Billy Rex is a worm

16:47.474 --> 16:49.140
in the truest sense of the word.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.776
That boy,
he goes underground,

16:51.778 --> 16:54.045
and trust me,
he's gone.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.714
DEEKS:
<i> I want to meet the owner...</i>

16:56.716 --> 16:58.182
Oh!

16:58.184 --> 16:59.317
(car alarm whooping)

16:59.319 --> 17:02.453
...of the worst Mustang
ever made!

17:05.258 --> 17:08.026
You picked the wrong car
to mess with.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.594
How you think this is gonna go?

17:09.596 --> 17:12.096
Oh, I don't know,
you tell me.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.264
Put it down.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.632
DEEKS:
You heard her.
Drop it.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.701
Get on your knees.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.571
DEEKS:
Going in.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.290
Kensi, I think I got a body.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.126
(clears throat)

17:46.599 --> 17:48.132
(belches loudly)

17:48.134 --> 17:49.400
Oh.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.069
Oh...

17:51.071 --> 17:53.704
Well, Merry Christmas to me.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.351
Leroy Moss.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.189
That's quite
a rap sheet...

18:11.191 --> 18:14.659
albeit
unimpressive.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.695
Indecent exposure's
kind of impressive.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.597
I could show you
if you like.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.432
Oh.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.602
Well, you could pull out
whatever you want.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.604
Can't guarantee
you'll leave with it, though.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.373
Oh, come on,
I just thought, you know...

18:29.375 --> 18:31.776
you got a little handsy
when you searched me--

18:31.778 --> 18:33.444
a little personal,

18:33.446 --> 18:34.779
a little intimate.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.547
I liked it.

18:36.549 --> 18:37.615
Hmm.

18:39.385 --> 18:42.220
Well, I was...

18:42.222 --> 18:44.655
looking for something
from the break-in this morning.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.158
A thumb
drive.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.127
Didn't take no thumb drive.

18:49.129 --> 18:52.363
I would think carefully
about your next answer, Leroy.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.765
Because if your friend

18:54.767 --> 18:57.802
talks before you do,

18:57.804 --> 19:00.404
guess who serves more time.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.306
(belches)
Mom...

19:02.308 --> 19:04.525
I'm sorry,
what?

19:04.526 --> 19:06.743
No, definitely...
definitely not your mom.

19:06.746 --> 19:09.480
According to this,
your mom is still serving time

19:09.482 --> 19:11.849
in Victorville Pen for--
wow, look at that--

19:11.851 --> 19:13.651
operating a meth lab.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.620
So I guess you're not
entirely to blame

19:15.622 --> 19:18.356
for your current situation,
then, are you?

19:18.358 --> 19:21.225
Why don't
you tell me

19:21.227 --> 19:22.693
where the malware
is, Stuart?

19:22.695 --> 19:24.295
Where's the
malware?

19:24.297 --> 19:25.530
Where's the mal...

19:25.532 --> 19:26.831
Ware's the Mal?

19:26.833 --> 19:30.234
Wait... who's Mal, man?

19:30.236 --> 19:31.402
Not mal man,

19:31.404 --> 19:33.638
it's a... malware,
it's... oh, wow.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.173
This is...

19:35.175 --> 19:37.175
You're firing on all cylinders.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.242
It's a thumb drive.

19:38.244 --> 19:39.810
Thumb drive.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.812
Oh.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.448
Rex has it.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.683
Mm-hmm.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.685
Wrong answer, Leroy.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.321
Okay, no, wait!
Wait!

19:50.323 --> 19:51.722
Come back.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.427
Rex is the one
that went into the room

19:56.429 --> 19:58.796
with all of the, uh...
computer stuff.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.131
Servers.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.465
Yeah, sure, whatever.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.900
Rex went to the servers, okay?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.669
Then he plugged something in,

20:04.671 --> 20:07.838
then he poured gasoline
all over the servers.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.840
When he pulled out his lighter,

20:09.842 --> 20:11.642
Stu and me just ran.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.444
All right, so...

20:13.446 --> 20:15.713
Rex has the thumb drive.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.914
Where's he taking it?

20:16.916 --> 20:18.983
He's not going anywhere,

20:18.985 --> 20:21.252
because you arrested him.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.655
Wait...

20:24.657 --> 20:27.992
are you a cop?

20:27.994 --> 20:29.560
I am a cop, just like I was

20:29.562 --> 20:31.429
the first two times
you asked that question.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.430
Still a cop.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.965
Oh, man.

20:33.967 --> 20:36.500
This doesn't look
like a police station.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.636
How did Rex know
about the malware?

20:38.638 --> 20:41.472
Did he ever tell you
who got him this job?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.708
All I know

20:43.710 --> 20:46.010
is Rex thought he could
make money off this thing.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.446
A lot of money.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.614
And Rex...

20:49.616 --> 20:50.781
I don't know if you've noticed,

20:50.783 --> 20:52.550
but he's kind of a scary guy.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.018
So...

20:54.020 --> 20:56.687
I didn't ask a lot of questions.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.895
Okay. Good talk.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.864
Anything else you wanted
to bring up at this point?

21:06.866 --> 21:07.932
Hmm?

21:07.934 --> 21:09.467
(snoring)

21:09.469 --> 21:10.635
Hmm, all right, fair enough.

21:10.637 --> 21:13.004
Yeah.
Huh... what?

21:13.006 --> 21:14.538
No.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.607
All right.
Thanks, Kens.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.378
Other two Santas didn't
have the thumb drive.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.679
It wasn't in
the motel room?

21:21.681 --> 21:23.381
They said
Rex had it.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.349
But LAPD didn't
find it on him.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.018
You're Rex.

21:27.020 --> 21:28.019
I'm LAPD.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.038
I got you
pinned down,

21:30.039 --> 21:32.056
but you're holding
millions of dollars'
worth of malware.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.457
What do you do?

21:33.459 --> 21:34.792
I drop it.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.027
Leave it somewhere safe

21:36.029 --> 21:38.029
till I can escape
and come back for it.

21:38.031 --> 21:40.298
But where?

21:42.468 --> 21:43.668
Or with who?

21:44.737 --> 21:46.637
CALLEN:
Zoom in there.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.805
Slow it down.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.343
Now stop it.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.412
What is it?

21:55.682 --> 21:57.381
Rex had to have placed
that thumb drive

21:57.383 --> 21:58.516
somewhere on Jo.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.618
SAM: He doesn't know
who she is, G.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.586
By the time he escaped, she was
gone from the crime scene.

22:02.588 --> 22:03.854
CALLEN: Yeah, but he's
gonna be searching for her.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.690
We've got to find Rex
before he finds Jo.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.025
And I may know
how to do that.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.394
Our malware expert,
Peter Weber.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.897
It didn't make
any sense.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.399
I mean, h-how did a Neanderthal
like Rex know to go after

22:15.401 --> 22:17.535
high-tech property
that belonged to Weber?

22:17.537 --> 22:20.705
So, I went looking for
a common denominator.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.573
SAM:
The bookie?

22:22.575 --> 22:23.874
Weber was gambling?

22:23.876 --> 22:25.576
No. And yes.

22:25.578 --> 22:26.711
Over the past six months,

22:26.713 --> 22:29.580
Tate's legit bank
accounts were hit

22:29.582 --> 22:31.349
by a targeted malware attack.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.817
Money was
being skimmed

22:32.819 --> 22:35.353
and sent to a separate
corporate account

22:35.355 --> 22:37.521
that I managed
to link back to Weber.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.957
SAM: That's what the accountant
wanted to tell Tate.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.959
Except he told
Billy Rex first.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.661
Tate's top man.

22:43.663 --> 22:46.630
So, Rex sees the opportunity
for an easy score.

22:46.632 --> 22:49.734
Kills his boss' accountant.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.435
He goes after Weber
and the stolen money.

22:51.437 --> 22:52.903
Somewhere along
the line,

22:52.905 --> 22:55.573
the money grew to include
some big malware payday.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.908
If Rex wants that payday,
he's gonna have to get Jo.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.910
Find the thumb drive.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.545
I'll bring in Weber.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.651
(door rattling)

23:15.628 --> 23:17.628
Hello?

23:17.630 --> 23:19.697
(rattling continues)

23:26.506 --> 23:27.638
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.973
(laughing):
Callen.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.941
I wasn't expecting you
for another few hours.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.943
Mmm.

23:32.945 --> 23:35.613
Pushed my last meeting,
and I, uh, I snuck out early.

23:35.615 --> 23:36.947
Oh, macaroons,
thank you.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.616
Mm-hmm.

23:38.618 --> 23:42.520
Yeah, figured after the day
you had, you deserved it.

23:44.490 --> 23:45.790
These...
(gasps)
Ooh.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.124
...are for you.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.759
And I'm even...

23:48.761 --> 23:50.995
going to cook you
a little dinner.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.763
Really?
Mm-hmm.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.799
You can't even
fry an egg.

23:54.801 --> 23:55.800
That's a good point.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.201
But you know what I can do?

23:57.203 --> 23:58.803
I can open a bottle of wine.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.675
You have no idea
how scary it is,

24:04.677 --> 24:06.610
having someone
hold a gun on you.

24:07.713 --> 24:09.680
I can only imagine.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.586
I love you for coming
to be with me.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.826
Better get some water
for these flowers.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.215
Callen's gonna have
to get clear of Joelle

24:44.217 --> 24:46.083
if he's gonna find
that thumb drive.

24:46.085 --> 24:49.220
It's got to be weird running
an op on your girlfriend.

24:49.222 --> 24:51.489
She might not be his
girlfriend after this op.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.157
Wow, really?

24:53.158 --> 24:54.824
Any more depressing thoughts
you want to have this afternoon?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.694
I'm just saying that
this job tends to ruin

24:56.696 --> 24:57.928
any chance at a personal life.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.230
That's not true, look at us.

24:59.232 --> 25:01.065
We're going on a trip together,
that's personal.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.199
We're going skiing to Mammoth.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.534
That's practical, actually.

25:03.536 --> 25:04.869
We have the same days off,

25:04.871 --> 25:06.737
and it's only a few hours
from Los Angeles.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.739
Okay, so it's
a personal trip

25:08.741 --> 25:10.741
that just happens to be
incredibly practical.

25:10.743 --> 25:11.976
What's wrong with that?

25:13.279 --> 25:14.678
Nothing.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.746
Nothing wrong with it.

25:15.748 --> 25:19.216
You're... you're right.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.125
Mmm.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.127
More, please.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.196
Mm-hmm.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.101
Ooh.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.068
Oops.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.154
Looks like
we need more.

25:40.155 --> 25:42.239
There's a nice Pinot Noir
in the hallway rack.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.108
I will find it.
Okay.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.309
I'll be right back.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.172
¶ ¶

26:39.298 --> 26:41.665
Kensi, Deeks.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.133
I got the drive.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.002
In here? Okay.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.136
Yeah.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.137
Musty. Whoa.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.739
Sit down.

26:51.677 --> 26:53.677
Uh, okay, if I just,
you know...

26:53.679 --> 26:56.313
I just got to tell you,
y-you can chill on the, uh...

26:56.315 --> 26:59.200
the aggressive front,
okay?

26:59.201 --> 27:02.086
'Cause... 'cause I'm-I'm here
to help you recover<i> my</i> property.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.157
I'm here to help you.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.159
Um...

27:09.161 --> 27:11.028
You're, uh...

27:11.030 --> 27:12.696
(laughs nervously)

27:12.698 --> 27:14.765
You're freaking me out,
sitting so close.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.876
If you don't
prove helpful,

27:25.878 --> 27:27.878
Mr. Weber,

27:27.880 --> 27:30.347
I may just drop you

27:30.349 --> 27:34.118
in general population
at Twin Towers prison.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.121
Um...

27:37.123 --> 27:39.189
Y-You can't do that.

27:40.359 --> 27:43.360
You're correct.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.697
But I think it would
take about a week

27:46.699 --> 27:49.767
for the mistake
to be sorted out.

27:51.704 --> 27:55.372
Do you think you
could last a week?

27:57.343 --> 27:59.410
I-I can't be around prisoners.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.785
We know you were
skimming off

28:07.787 --> 28:09.286
of Lincoln Tate's
accounts.

28:09.288 --> 28:12.022
And Billy Rex
found out about it.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.358
(sighs)

28:15.995 --> 28:17.161
Okay.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.328
Look.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.464
Rex said he'd kill me
if I didn't give him

28:20.466 --> 28:22.299
every single dollar
I stole.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.467
Plus interest.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.002
And I didn't...

28:25.004 --> 28:26.403
I-I didn't have it.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.806
I'm not gonna let
that psycho shoot me.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.843
So, you told
him about...

28:32.845 --> 28:34.845
the power
grid malware.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.314
It's worth millions.

28:37.316 --> 28:40.851
The only problem was--
you were under DoD oversight.

28:40.853 --> 28:43.320
Couldn't just
give it to him.

28:43.322 --> 28:46.356
You had to make it
look like a robbery.

28:48.327 --> 28:51.428
Where is Mr. Rex right now?

28:51.430 --> 28:53.430
Before he was
arrested,

28:53.432 --> 28:57.301
Rex dropped the malware
into a lady's shopping bag.

28:57.303 --> 29:00.370
And then he contacted me just
before you guys picked me up.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.876
What did you do?

29:07.847 --> 29:11.315
I-I accessed the records
of that store, what's it called?

29:11.317 --> 29:13.350
Preston's.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.385
And I gave Rex that lady's I.D.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.387
and address.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.391
He's headed
there now.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.364
Callen, we're a go.

29:27.366 --> 29:31.235
I got Rex and two guys
just stepped out of an SUV.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.070
They're heading
towards Joelle's house.

29:33.072 --> 29:35.139
Heads up.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.079
I'll move to
intercept.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.222
(cork pops)

30:05.404 --> 30:07.838
(Christmas music plays)

30:10.176 --> 30:12.176
Oh.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.178
(laughs)

30:14.180 --> 30:15.512
What are we doing?

30:15.514 --> 30:18.515
Mmm, I think we're dancing,
but I could be wrong.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.250
I haven't done this
very often.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.486
We've never done this.

30:22.488 --> 30:23.487
Never?
Uh-uh.

30:23.489 --> 30:24.822
Hmm.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.557
First time
for everything.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.100
What was that?
Nothing.

30:37.102 --> 30:39.102
I didn't hear
a thing.

30:39.104 --> 30:40.437
Sorry.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.606
I'm a little
jumpy today.
Yeah.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.015
Nothing, I didn't
see anything.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.219
Callen, we don't have
the other two.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.156
(glass shatters)

30:59.158 --> 31:00.157
Was that in
my bedroom?!

31:00.159 --> 31:02.092
This way.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.637
We need to call
the police.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.006
(screams)

31:16.542 --> 31:18.108
You have a gun?!

31:19.578 --> 31:21.945
Oh, my God,
you shot him?!

31:29.421 --> 31:31.255
Callen, that was the
guy from this morning.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.456
What the hell
is going on?

31:32.458 --> 31:33.490
You just got
to trust me.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.292
I'll get us
out of this.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.929
Do you trust me, Jo?

31:38.931 --> 31:40.197
Who are you?

31:53.112 --> 31:54.912
We have to get out of the open.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.215
Callen, just stop.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.549
What are we doing?

31:59.551 --> 32:00.984
I've never seen
you like this.

32:00.986 --> 32:03.186
Jo, I promise you,
I'll explain everything.

32:03.188 --> 32:04.955
Right now,
we have got to move.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.995
MAN:
Got 'em in the back alley.

32:11.997 --> 32:13.931
BILLY REX:
Copy. Headed your way.

32:16.402 --> 32:17.401
Federal agents!
Drop it!

32:17.403 --> 32:18.836
Put it down!

32:18.837 --> 32:20.270
On the floor, right now,
on your knees.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.039
All the way down!

32:23.976 --> 32:24.641
Hands behind
your back.

32:24.643 --> 32:25.642
Callen.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.044
Callen, do you copy?

32:27.046 --> 32:28.278
Where are you?

32:29.982 --> 32:31.348
I got nothing.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.295
What is that?

32:45.297 --> 32:46.563
Wh-What are you doing?

32:48.734 --> 32:49.733
Stay inside,
lock the door.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.268
I'll come get you
when it's safe.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.736
No, Callen...

32:52.738 --> 32:55.305
Jo, this'll be over fast.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.573
Now, what are you gonna do?

32:56.575 --> 32:58.241
Lock the door and wait for you.

32:58.243 --> 33:00.143
That's right.

33:11.590 --> 33:12.756
(rapid gunshots)

33:18.731 --> 33:20.564
(grunting)

33:41.754 --> 33:44.021
(panting)

33:47.226 --> 33:49.793
Thought you said you were
gonna stay in the garage.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.631
I thought you said you were
a securities trader.

33:59.038 --> 34:01.104
(indistinct radio transmissions)

34:07.613 --> 34:09.312
See you later.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.785
Get this to Eric and Nell,
tell them to keep it secure.

34:14.787 --> 34:17.220
Oh, the computer virus that can
plunge America into darkness?

34:17.222 --> 34:19.156
Shouldn't I just throw this
into the burn room?

34:19.825 --> 34:21.725
That would be a bad idea,

34:21.727 --> 34:23.260
'cause of the chain of evidence
and all that.

34:23.262 --> 34:24.761
Yeah, I got it.

34:25.497 --> 34:26.730
She gonna be okay?

34:34.073 --> 34:35.472
I'm about to find out.

34:35.474 --> 34:36.573
Good luck.

34:55.127 --> 34:56.827
Let me guess.

34:56.829 --> 34:59.663
Not the first time you've had
to put your life on the line

34:59.665 --> 35:01.731
to save a lady.

35:08.173 --> 35:09.339
And Sam?

35:09.341 --> 35:11.608
I'm guessing he's...

35:11.610 --> 35:13.777
not in the medical
equipment field, is he?

35:14.713 --> 35:17.247
No.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.549
But Michelle, she's still...

35:22.821 --> 35:24.888
(sighs)

35:24.890 --> 35:27.524
Their kids are just kids.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.593
(chuckles)

35:30.529 --> 35:33.263
Humbug.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.867
Yeah, I guess I did kind of
ruin Christmas.

35:36.869 --> 35:39.136
No, that's not what...

35:40.839 --> 35:42.272
At school this week,

35:42.274 --> 35:44.474
I was reading the kids
<i> A Christmas Carol.</i>

35:44.476 --> 35:47.477
They, um, wanted to know

35:47.479 --> 35:48.712
what "humbug" meant.

35:48.714 --> 35:51.214
So we looked it up.

35:52.484 --> 35:55.418
It means deception.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.487
A fraud.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.825
An imposter.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.232
(sighs)

36:09.234 --> 36:11.301
Anyway...

36:13.372 --> 36:15.372
Thanks for saving
my life, Callen.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.440
Jo...
I think
you should leave now.

36:21.914 --> 36:24.648
(sighs)

36:26.818 --> 36:27.918
NELL:
<i> Beale!</i>

36:27.920 --> 36:29.419
Move it or lose it!

36:29.421 --> 36:30.887
Wheels up in 90!

36:30.889 --> 36:31.955
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.191
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
(chuckles)

36:34.193 --> 36:35.725
Is that a camera?

36:35.727 --> 36:37.627
Is that what we came
all the way back here for?

36:37.629 --> 36:39.763
Yeah, I realized,
if I'm gonna meet your family,

36:39.765 --> 36:40.931
what's my cover, right?

36:40.933 --> 36:42.766
You're a news editor,

36:42.768 --> 36:45.635
so I figured
photojournalist by day,

36:45.637 --> 36:48.271
superhero by night.

36:48.273 --> 36:50.207
(laughs)

36:50.209 --> 36:51.675
Okay, Clark.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.376
I think we're gonna have
to come up something

36:53.378 --> 36:54.511
a little more believable
than that.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.546
Okay, like what?

36:56.548 --> 36:58.548
Well, it has to make sense

36:58.550 --> 37:00.217
that you'd be coming home
with me.

37:00.219 --> 37:01.251
Right.

37:01.253 --> 37:02.752
Like, a boyfriend.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.754
(shutter clicks)
Aah!

37:04.756 --> 37:06.389
(scoffs) Mr. No Pants,

37:06.391 --> 37:09.459
you do realize that it's gonna
be freezing back East, right?

37:09.461 --> 37:10.994
What? I'm wearing a scarf.

37:11.863 --> 37:13.463
My first day back,

37:13.465 --> 37:15.365
and you give the entire
team the day off?

37:16.301 --> 37:17.968
Owen.

37:17.970 --> 37:19.903
I wasn't expecting you.

37:19.905 --> 37:22.505
And I make it a point
to always expect

37:22.507 --> 37:24.674
the unexpected.

37:24.676 --> 37:27.877
It'll take more than a little
poison to get rid of me.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.813
Besides, I'd rather
catch up on work.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.716
Holidays are
for the sentimental.

37:32.718 --> 37:35.919
Oh, you're not such a Grinch.

37:35.921 --> 37:39.789
I know there's still a heart
in there somewhere.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.725
You're right.

37:41.727 --> 37:43.360
(sighs)

37:43.362 --> 37:45.362
I'm just not telling you
where it is.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.963
For my own personal safety.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.932
Oh.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.401
Smart man.

37:54.339 --> 37:57.874
Merry Christmas, Owen.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.815
Merry Christmas, Henrietta.

38:15.394 --> 38:19.062
Any idea why Michelle wanted
us all to come down here today?

38:19.064 --> 38:20.864
Nope.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.300
She wants to skate,
we skate.

38:23.302 --> 38:25.368
You didn't think to ask why?

38:27.306 --> 38:28.838
Marriage, G.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.373
Marriage.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.441
Uh-huh.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.809
Hey.

38:32.811 --> 38:33.843
Hey, Kam.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.312
Hey, Uncle Callen.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.379
How are you?
Good.

38:36.381 --> 38:38.448
Hey.

38:38.450 --> 38:39.616
Hi.
Hey.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.352
You heard anything from Jo?

38:42.354 --> 38:43.820
No, I don't think I will.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.455
Sam-Dog!
Yo.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.057
I got them,
I got your skates,

38:47.059 --> 38:48.358
size 14.
No.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.926
Come on, come on.
Don't mind him.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.995
He's just mad
'cause he can't do it.
What?

38:51.997 --> 38:53.897
I could if I wanted to.
I don't.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.598
When am I gonna be
in a situation

38:55.600 --> 38:57.901
where I need to put blades
on my feet and move across ice?

38:57.903 --> 38:59.669
I live in L.A.
It's ridiculous.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.037
All right, how about this?

39:01.038 --> 39:02.404
I will use
my personal Christmas bonus

39:02.407 --> 39:03.890
to buy you lessons.

39:03.891 --> 39:05.374
Wait, we get
a Christmas bonus this year?

39:05.377 --> 39:06.676
We always get a Christmas bonus.

39:06.678 --> 39:07.844
(laughs)

39:07.846 --> 39:09.079
Wait, seriously?

39:09.081 --> 39:10.780
Seriously?

39:10.782 --> 39:12.549
I didn't get a Christmas bonus.
Always get a Christmas bonus.

39:12.551 --> 39:14.818
I didn't get a Christmas bonus!
All right. Oh, my gosh.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.686
Aah!

39:16.688 --> 39:18.822
Triple Salchows.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.824
Aah!

39:27.799 --> 39:28.698
All right, Kensilina.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.767
There you go.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.035
Um, I just,

39:32.037 --> 39:33.903
I-I want to talk to you
for a second.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.106
No, no.
(grunts)

39:36.108 --> 39:38.007
I got to go skate.
Come here.

39:38.009 --> 39:40.076
Deeks!

39:42.848 --> 39:44.481
Come here.

39:44.483 --> 39:45.749
I... All right.
Ow!

39:45.751 --> 39:46.916
Okay.
Go for Santa.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.551
(chuckles)

39:48.553 --> 39:51.755
(sighs)

39:51.757 --> 39:53.089
What's going on?

39:53.091 --> 39:54.758
You're freaking me out.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.360
Oh, my gosh.

39:56.361 --> 39:57.961
You plan these things to say,
and when the time comes,

39:57.963 --> 39:59.629
you can't say them.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.831
Um...

40:01.833 --> 40:04.467
Just you and me.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.736
Kensi and Deeks,
Deeks and Kensi.

40:06.738 --> 40:09.038
A-Alone, we're bold,

40:09.040 --> 40:10.774
we're brash,

40:10.776 --> 40:12.809
we can move mountains.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.712
And...

40:15.714 --> 40:16.980
together we're...

40:16.982 --> 40:18.948
Um...
We're safe.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.084
Yeah, together we're safe.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.752
Yeah, I know.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.954
I want to be bold,

40:24.956 --> 40:26.489
Deeks.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.830
But I want to be bold with you.

40:33.832 --> 40:35.832
So no more games then?

40:35.834 --> 40:37.767
No more games.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.135
Chips on the table?

40:39.137 --> 40:40.603
All in.

40:40.605 --> 40:42.071
All in.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.973
Tonight?
Tomorrow.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.542
And the day af...

40:59.458 --> 41:02.792
Dad, can I get a hot chocolate?

41:02.794 --> 41:03.927
Sure, Kam.

41:03.929 --> 41:05.161
Get your mom one, too, okay?

41:05.163 --> 41:06.930
Okay.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.998
(chuckles)

41:11.002 --> 41:13.002
I have a surprise for you.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.472
Really?
Mm-hmm.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.640
So, you're an
impossible man to shop for,

41:17.642 --> 41:19.843
so I didn't even try.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.548
SAM:
Aiden.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.584
Good to see you, Dad.

41:27.586 --> 41:28.751
(chuckles)

41:28.753 --> 41:30.153
Ah.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.888
I thought you were training
in Virginia.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.123
I, uh, missed
the California sun.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.559
Aiden, are you AWOL?

41:36.561 --> 41:39.229
No, sir, and I'd appreciate
you addressing me

41:39.231 --> 41:42.031
as Cadet Sergeant.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.067
You were promoted?

41:44.936 --> 41:46.569
I'm proud of you, son.

41:46.571 --> 41:48.938
Thanks, Dad.

42:09.828 --> 42:12.161
(sighs)

42:13.098 --> 42:15.598
So, you can skate.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.866
I know that about you now.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.668
You got my message.

42:18.670 --> 42:20.737
Mm-hmm.

42:22.941 --> 42:24.307
That's them?

42:24.309 --> 42:26.576
Your family?

42:29.881 --> 42:31.948
Yeah.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.918
I'd like you to meet them.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.986
If you want.

42:38.790 --> 42:40.890
I can't, Callen.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.792
I can't meet them.

42:44.696 --> 42:47.297
Not until I meet you.

42:51.303 --> 42:54.237
Okay.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.105
What do you want
to know about me?

42:56.107 --> 42:57.907
Hmm.

42:57.909 --> 43:00.577
Well...

43:00.579 --> 43:02.245
how about we start
with your first name?

43:02.247 --> 43:08.084
(chuckles) That is
a little bit complicated.
