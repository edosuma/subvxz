<b>My name is Oyamada Manta, I'm 13 years old.</b>

00:04.730 --> 00:09.150
<b>One night, coming home from cram school, I met a boy alone in a graveyard.</b>

00:09.150 --> 00:11.410
<b>His name is Asakura Yoh.</b>

00:11.410 --> 00:14.410
<b>He said he's a shaman, who binds this world with the next.</b>

00:14.830 --> 00:20.000
<b>I thought he was telling lies, but he said I was his friend.</b>

00:20.370 --> 00:24.460
<b>Yoh performed a Soul Merge with the legendary samurai Amidamaru,</b>

00:24.460 --> 00:27.300
<b>and defeated Wooden Sword Ryuu.</b>

00:27.300 --> 00:30.470
<b>Yoh wants to become the Shaman King.</b>

00:30.470 --> 00:34.470
<b>After that, Amidamaru
 became friends with him.</b>

00:37.770 --> 00:40.980
<b>I'm late because of cram school again!</b>

00:40.980 --> 00:45.400
<b>Oh right. I can take the shortcut through here.</b>

00:45.400 --> 00:48.740
<b>After all, I'm already familiar with all the ghosts around here,</b>

00:48.740 --> 00:51.280
<b>so there won't be any problems.</b>

00:52.860 --> 00:56.030
<b>Hey you, over there!
 Why are you in such a hurry?</b>

00:56.030 --> 00:59.330
<b>Hmm? Huh? Yoh?</b>

00:59.330 --> 01:03.290
<b>No, it's not him. Who the hell is that guy?</b>

01:04.290 --> 01:08.420
<b>There are other people like<i> you, </i>aren't there?</b>

01:08.420 --> 01:11.340
<b>Oh! I shouldn't be wasting time here!</b>

01:11.340 --> 01:14.340
<b>There's no sky in Tokyo.</b>

01:14.340 --> 01:18.470
<b>Stars are like streetlights that guide us humans.</b>

01:18.470 --> 01:20.680
<b>Those who can't read their movements,</b>

01:20.680 --> 01:24.940
<b>will lose sight of the right path and perish.</b>

01:24.940 --> 01:28.610
<b>Are you also one of those fools?</b>

01:28.610 --> 01:30.490
<b>How rude of you!</b>

01:30.490 --> 01:36.070
<b>Also, what do you mean you can't see the stars? This is the best place in the city for it!</b>

01:36.070 --> 01:40.330
<b>Huh. I wouldn't really call <i>these </i>the real thing.</b>

01:40.330 --> 01:43.540
<b>I thought you wouldn't understand, but...</b>

01:44.290 --> 01:47.630
<b>It's because you can see
 the spirits too, can't you?</b>

01:47.630 --> 01:50.050
<b>Spirits? What are you...</b>

01:50.050 --> 01:55.680
<b>Don't be afraid. I don't intend to hurt you.</b>

01:55.680 --> 01:58.140
<b>I just have a little favor to ask.</b>

01:58.140 --> 01:59.220
<b>A favor?</b>

01:59.220 --> 02:02.850
<b>I want you to tell this to your friend, the boy with the headphones.</b>

<b>It's the truth!</b>

04:11.020 --> 04:12.230
<b>In that cemetery.</b>

04:12.480 --> 04:15.480
<b>There was a boy with the spirit of a Chinese General.</b>

04:15.480 --> 04:17.990
<b>There's no doubt.
He's another shaman!</b>

04:17.990 --> 04:20.240
<b>There's another shaman besides you!</b>

04:20.240 --> 04:22.240
<b>Wow, that's amazing.</b>

04:22.240 --> 04:24.030
<b>Aren't you surprised?</b>

04:24.030 --> 04:28.500
<b>What? Nobody said I'm the only shaman.</b>

04:28.500 --> 04:31.880
<b>There are still many shamans all over the world.</b>

04:31.880 --> 04:35.000
<b>He said he's going to take Amidamaru from you!</b>

04:35.000 --> 04:37.590
<b>Isn't that a big problem?!</b>

04:38.260 --> 04:39.970
<b>Amidamaru?</b>

04:40.720 --> 04:43.090
<b>Hmm, Ren.</b>

04:43.090 --> 04:46.890
<b>Nope, I don't know him after all.
Never heard any shaman with that name.</b>

04:46.890 --> 04:49.350
<b>Really? But hasn't he got
 something against you?</b>

04:49.350 --> 04:51.310
<b>Like a grudge or something like that.</b>

04:51.310 --> 04:55.610
<b>I don't remember him, but if I had to guess, it could be <i>that.</i></b>

04:55.610 --> 04:56.980
<b>That?</b>

04:56.980 --> 05:00.950
<b>A shaman's rank is determined by that of his spirit.</b>

05:00.950 --> 05:04.910
<b>He must've seen me 
and Amidamaru somewhere.</b>

05:04.910 --> 05:06.080
<b>I understand now.</b>

05:06.080 --> 05:07.330
<b>Amidamaru?</b>

05:07.450 --> 05:11.410
<b>So he's seen how cool and strong
 I am, and now wants to capture me.</b>

05:11.410 --> 05:15.540
<b>Maybe, but you shouldn't say things like that to yourself.</b>

05:15.540 --> 05:18.300
<b>Also, Master. The fact that his spirit is</b>

05:18.300 --> 05:20.970
<b>a Chinese General, is what I'm curious about.</b>

05:21.170 --> 05:22.300
<b>Ugh.</b>

05:22.470 --> 05:24.300
<b>It's going to be fine.</b>

05:24.300 --> 05:28.270
<b>As I said, there aren't any bad people who can see spirits.</b>

05:28.270 --> 05:30.680
<b>So don't worry about it.</b>

05:30.680 --> 05:33.350
<b>I'm sure he's got some reason for it.</b>

05:33.350 --> 05:35.110
<b>I'd like to meet him too.</b>

05:35.110 --> 05:38.320
<b>He could be my very first shaman friend.</b>

05:38.320 --> 05:43.490
<b>Oh! I'd like to meet that

05:44.490 --> 05:46.320
<b>I'm looking forward to it.</b>

<b>What are you doing, you little brat?</b>

<b>Oh! That's the guy! He's Ren!</b>

05:57.250 --> 05:59.000
<b>Oh, so that's him.</b>

05:59.000 --> 06:01.130
<b>I can't see the General's Spirit though.</b>

06:01.340 --> 06:04.340
<b>Hm. Stop yelling, you vermin!</b>

06:04.510 --> 06:07.010
<b>It's the car that was in my way.</b>

06:07.010 --> 06:09.720
<b>Huh? That doesn't mean you can kick it!</b>

06:09.720 --> 06:10.850
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

06:10.850 --> 06:12.680
<b>And to call us vermin!</b>

06:12.680 --> 06:16.060
<b>The exhaust fumes it's spewing are polluting the sky.</b>

06:16.060 --> 06:18.360
<b>It'll block the view of the stars.</b>

06:18.900 --> 06:22.360
<b>Isn't that enough of a reason to say you're vermin on this Earth?</b>

06:22.570 --> 06:24.450
<b>You insignificant cockroach.</b>

06:24.450 --> 06:27.120
<b>You little bastard! Don't think you can get away with this!</b>

<b>Aargh!</b>

06:33.660 --> 06:35.250
<b>Oh, martial arts!</b>

06:35.250 --> 06:37.000
<b>That move is amazing!</b>

06:37.920 --> 06:41.380
<b>What? Is he really a shaman?</b>

06:41.380 --> 06:43.170
<b>He's so strong even without a spirit!</b>

06:43.170 --> 06:46.010
<b>No, that time I'm pretty sure I saw a spirit.</b>

06:46.010 --> 06:48.390
<b>Maybe I was wrong.</b>

06:49.180 --> 06:52.390
<b>I'm going to kill that bastard.</b>

06:52.390 --> 06:54.140
<b>Huh?</b>

06:54.140 --> 06:57.940
<b>I guess I have to exterminate

<b>Come out, Bason!</b>

<b>So you finally showed up,

08:25.670 --> 08:26.480
<b>What?</b>

08:26.480 --> 08:29.450
<b>I don't know what you're talking about.</b>

08:29.450 --> 08:32.910
<b>First of all, why are you suddenly asking me to give him to you?</b>

08:32.910 --> 08:36.240
<b>Would you like it if I said “please”?</b>

08:36.490 --> 08:39.330
<b>No. Amidamaru is my friend.</b>

<b>Don't treat him like a servant.</b>

08:43.000 --> 08:44.120
<b>Friend?</b>

08:44.120 --> 08:45.210
<b>Close friends.</b>

08:45.210 --> 08:47.670
<b>If you want Amidamaru's help,</b>

08:47.670 --> 08:50.510
<b>why don't you become his friend?</b>

08:50.510 --> 08:54.800
<b>You're friends with a spirit?</b>

08:54.800 --> 08:57.180
<b>Do you consider spirits to be your friends?</b>

08:57.180 --> 08:59.640
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

08:59.850 --> 09:05.730
<b>To us shamans, spirits are nothing more than a tool to bring out our abilities.</b>

09:05.730 --> 09:09.780
<b>How can we harbor trivial feelings of friendship for such a tool?</b>

09:09.780 --> 09:11.200
<b>A tool?</b>

09:11.400 --> 09:15.160
<b>What? I was merely stating the truth.</b>

09:15.160 --> 09:18.540
<b>You don't know how to use that samurai.</b>

09:19.410 --> 09:23.790
<b>A strong spirit is only worthy of me.</b>

09:24.540 --> 09:26.540
<b>If you won't give it to me,</b>

09:26.540 --> 09:29.670
<b>then I'll have to take him by force.</b>

09:29.670 --> 09:30.760
<b>Go, Bason!</b>

09:30.970 --> 09:34.930
<b>First of all you must destroy 
that spirit's owner, the shaman!</b>

09:35.930 --> 09:38.730
<b>A lost spirit that has been separated from its owner,</b>

09:38.730 --> 09:43.650
<b>can be easily tamed by a top-notch 
shaman, regardless of his intentions.</b>

09:43.650 --> 09:47.070
<b>And they will be transformed into magnificent tools.</b>

09:49.230 --> 09:51.190
<b>And that thing behind you.</b>

09:51.190 --> 09:54.570
<b>Did you do the same to that guy?

<b>I'm here!</b>

<b>until you go down?!</b>

<b>How dare you block my Slash Dance.</b>

10:51.710 --> 10:54.630
<b>I knew my eyes weren't lying.</b>

10:54.630 --> 10:58.300
<b>You're making me want

<b>This is the end of the test!
I'm going to be serious from now on!</b>

11:03.140 --> 11:05.940

<b>Amidamaru.</b>

<b>It is true that you are far stronger than my Bason.</b>

<b>But you already realized, didn't you?</b>

11:14.280 --> 11:19.410
<b>That man is not even 10% of your strength, and by such you can't use much of it.</b>

11:20.110 --> 11:21.370
<b>Take a look.</b>

<b>This is the power of a true shaman.</b>

11:42.890 --> 11:47.060
<b>The ability to draw 100% of a 
spirit's power back into this world.</b>

11:47.440 --> 11:53.400
<b>It requires a strong mind
 to use the spirits as tools.</b>

11:54.690 --> 11:58.700
<b>You and I have different levels as shamans.</b>

11:58.860 --> 12:01.450
<b>Amidamaru is mine.</b>

12:12.710 --> 12:14.420
<b>Yoh?</b>

12:14.420 --> 12:19.470
<b>What the hell is going on?!
I can't believe you and Amidamaru lost!</b>

12:19.470 --> 12:21.010
<b>You're too soft.</b>

12:21.010 --> 12:24.720
<b>A shaman who can't control
 spirits can't master their use.</b>

12:24.720 --> 12:27.480
<b>And that spirit claims to be your friend.</b>

12:27.640 --> 12:30.270
<b>Of course you can't control one!</b>

12:30.940 --> 12:32.310
<b>Control?</b>

12:32.310 --> 12:36.030
<b>We have no choice but to do that.</b>

12:36.030 --> 12:38.440
<b>After all, in the state of possession,</b>

12:38.440 --> 12:43.030
<b>there are two souls at the 
same time within our body.</b>

12:43.030 --> 12:45.200
<b>Two.</b>

12:45.200 --> 12:48.120
<b>Heh, you understand quickly.</b>

12:48.120 --> 12:51.500
<b>One body, two minds at the controls.</b>

12:51.500 --> 12:54.750
<b>The resistance that would 
arise would be immeasurable.</b>

12:54.920 --> 12:58.510
<b>It slows down processing
 of information, disagreements.</b>

12:58.510 --> 13:02.180
<b>When two souls are on
 the same level, like friends,</b>

13:02.180 --> 13:05.720
<b>it's only natural that 
they can't move the body.</b>

13:06.180 --> 13:10.850
<b>A shaman is a being who uses the power of the spirit in this world through their will.</b>

13:11.100 --> 13:14.110
<b>In order to do so, having
 100% control over a spirit,</b>

13:14.110 --> 13:17.110
<b>and using it as a tool, is essential.</b>

13:17.110 --> 13:20.030
<b>Guys who prattle on about being friends with them,</b>

13:20.030 --> 13:22.780
<b>can't possibly use spirits as tools.</b>

13:24.780 --> 13:27.620
<b>No matter how good the car is,</b>

13:27.620 --> 13:31.620
<b>if the driver is trash, you're
 going to lose the race.</b>

13:31.620 --> 13:36.880
<b>To win the race, a good car and a good driver are essential.</b>

13:37.090 --> 13:39.260
<b>You can die in peace.</b>

13:39.260 --> 13:42.800
<b>I'll take good care of Amidamaru.</b>

13:43.890 --> 13:46.140
<b>Amidamaru is not a machine.</b>

13:47.230 --> 13:48.550
<b>Yoh!</b>

13:48.810 --> 13:52.520
<b>I told you that Amidamaru is my friend.</b>

13:52.520 --> 13:55.860
<b>And you still treat him as a tool!</b>

13:55.860 --> 13:59.610
<b>You bastard. Still have the strength to get up?</b>

13:59.610 --> 14:01.280
<b>Damn.</b>

14:01.280 --> 14:03.780
<b>If Amidamaru hadn't dodged just in time,</b>

14:03.780 --> 14:05.820
<b>I'd have lost my arm.</b>

14:06.530 --> 14:09.080
<b>Hahahahaha!</b>

14:09.080 --> 14:13.460
<b>Even in your handicapped state, 
you could still evade Bason's attack.</b>

14:13.460 --> 14:16.830
<b>You're making me want you even more.</b>

14:16.830 --> 14:18.380
<b>Amidamaru!</b>

14:18.380 --> 14:22.130
<b>Stop messing around! 
I won't possess anyone else!</b>

14:22.130 --> 14:25.590
<b>Don't get cocky. What can you do in such a state</b>

14:25.590 --> 14:28.430
<b>with your master's injuries?</b>

14:29.930 --> 14:33.890
<b>I'm sorry Master Yoh, if only I was stronger.</b>

14:33.890 --> 14:38.020
<b>What are you talking about?
You're strong enough, Amidamaru.</b>

14:38.860 --> 14:41.320
<b>I'm the one who's weak.</b>

14:41.320 --> 14:44.110
<b>What a disaster.
I can't believe a guy like him is here.</b>

14:44.360 --> 14:46.530
<b>Master Yoh.</b>

14:46.530 --> 14:49.740
<b>Amidamaru, I can't win.</b>

14:49.740 --> 14:52.120
<b>So run away from here as fast as possible.</b>

14:53.790 --> 14:56.040
<b>You're wasting your time again.</b>

14:56.040 --> 15:01.340
<b>Once you're dead, the samurai's
 place in this world will be no more.</b>

15:01.340 --> 15:04.880
<b>That's why he will go to the 
afterlife with his best friend Mosuke.</b>

15:05.050 --> 15:08.300
<b>Amidamaru doesn't have any
 regrets in this world anymore.</b>

15:08.830 --> 15:09.790
<b><i>Afterlife.</i></b>

15:09.790 --> 15:10.890
<b>You idiot!</b>

15:10.890 --> 15:15.480
<b>Normally, once a spirit has passed away, it can never come back.</b>

15:15.480 --> 15:18.520
<b>In other words, you're
 abandoning your own spirit!</b>

15:20.480 --> 15:23.280
<b>If the only other option is to let him become your tool,</b>

15:23.280 --> 15:25.780
<b>then absolutely yes.</b>

15:25.950 --> 15:27.610
<b>Master Yoh.</b>

15:27.610 --> 15:30.910
<b>You bastard!</b>

15:30.910 --> 15:34.410
<b>I'll kill you before that samurai can pass on!</b>

15:34.410 --> 15:37.710
<b>And then I'll make him my property!</b>

15:37.710 --> 15:39.380
<b>Amidamaru!</b>

15:39.380 --> 15:42.920
<b>Idiot, what are you doing?
Hurry up and run away!</b>

15:43.090 --> 15:47.720
<b>Master Yoh. I'm well aware I can't do anything.</b>

15:47.720 --> 15:50.930
<b>But as a samurai, I can't
 leave my lord and run away.</b>

15:51.180 --> 15:53.220
<b>And moreover, you have</b>

15:53.220 --> 15:56.680
<b>a future in this world, Yoh!</b>

15:56.680 --> 15:58.690
<b>Amidamaru.</b>

15:58.690 --> 16:02.150
<b>Such a wonderful friendship, you idiots.</b>

16:02.150 --> 16:03.650
<b>But because of that friendship,</b>

16:03.650 --> 16:06.940
<b>you still can't understand that it's
 impossible to defeat me by will alone?</b>

16:06.940 --> 16:08.400
<b>Let's go, Bason!</b>

16:09.610 --> 16:11.870
<b>100% Soul Merge!</b>

<b>Even though he's almost dead, he can match my attacks.</b>

16:27.590 --> 16:31.340
<b>How were you able to block Bason's attack?</b>

16:31.890 --> 16:36.850
<b>He's using 100% Soul Merge!</b>

16:39.310 --> 16:40.690
<b>It can't be.</b>

16:40.690 --> 16:44.980
<b>There's no way people who say they're friends can do something like this.</b>

16:44.980 --> 16:46.980
<b>Of course we can.</b>

16:47.530 --> 16:49.740
<b>You taught me that.</b>

16:49.740 --> 16:52.990
<b>If our feelings merge 100%,</b>

16:52.990 --> 16:56.330
<b>I can use 100% of the spirit's power.</b>

16:57.620 --> 17:01.370
<b>And now our feelings have become one.</b>

17:02.000 --> 17:04.250
<b>We can defeat you!</b>

17:05.590 --> 17:07.000
<b>That stance.</b>

17:07.170 --> 17:10.420
<b>The stance that made Amidamaru a demon 600 years ago.</b>

17:10.590 --> 17:13.010
<b>The legendary style that killed a thousand people!</b>

17:16.450 --> 17:18.210
<b>The Budda!</b>

17:18.600 --> 17:21.440
<b>What a bunch of nonsense.</b>

17:21.440 --> 17:25.310
<b>There's no such thing as 100% merged feelings.</b>

17:26.820 --> 17:29.030
<b>This friend of yours.</b>

17:29.030 --> 17:34.160
<b>Would he do anything for you,

17:34.160 --> 17:35.620
<b>Yes!</b>

17:36.620 --> 17:39.040
<b>This is the answer!</b>

17:39.040 --> 17:41.540
<b>Halo Blade!</b>

17:42.460 --> 17:45.040
<b>100% Possession.</b>

<b>No way. If this is true,</b>

<b>Master Yoh!</b>

<b>What the hell is that?</b>

<b>It's been four years since you started training.</b>

18:10.860 --> 18:13.610
<b>You still can't even summon earthly spirits!</b>

18:13.610 --> 18:18.490
<b>Eh? But Grandpa, normal people aren't capable of doing this.</b>

18:18.490 --> 18:21.750
<b>Why do I have to learn how to do it?</b>

18:22.580 --> 18:26.040
<b>If you think you can't do something then,</b>

18:26.040 --> 18:29.840
<b>you'll never be able to do it!</b>

18:29.840 --> 18:32.840
<b>You devil!</b>

<b>The special technique of a typical Japanese Shaman: spirit control.</b>

18:37.510 --> 18:43.850
<b>You too are a member of the Asakura family, all made by shamans, you should at least master that!</b>

18:43.850 --> 18:45.150
<b>I don't care!</b>

18:45.150 --> 18:46.230
<b>What did you say?</b>

18:46.230 --> 18:49.440
<b>I said I have no intention of becoming a shaman at all.</b>

18:50.070 --> 18:53.780
<b>Then what do you want to do in the future?</b>

18:53.780 --> 18:59.120
<b>As for me, as long as I can listen to my favorite music every day and live a laid back life, that's all that matters.</b>

19:00.330 --> 19:02.500
<b>You idiot!</b>

19:03.120 --> 19:07.830
<b>It's pathetic. People in this world are becoming more and more like this.</b>

19:07.830 --> 19:12.250
<b>Nowadays, people are slowly forgetting about ghosts and the spirits that dwell in the earth.</b>

19:12.250 --> 19:16.380
<b>We can't break free from
 the great cycle of nature.</b>

19:16.840 --> 19:20.390
<b>If the forest is ruined, there will be fewer trees and less air.</b>

19:20.390 --> 19:25.060
<b>When the soil is gone, the water has nowhere to go, and it overflows.</b>

19:25.060 --> 19:31.070
<b>Everything in the world is
 connected in a big cycle like this.</b>

19:31.360 --> 19:37.700
<b>That's why humans need a guide to live on this planet.</b>

19:38.360 --> 19:40.160
<b>Is that...</b>

19:42.700 --> 19:45.160
<b>An omniscient, omnipotent, ultimate spirit.</b>

19:45.370 --> 19:49.380
<b>The King of the Spirits is 
commonly referred to as a God.</b>

19:51.170 --> 19:54.170
<b>The King of the Spirits?</b>

19:54.340 --> 19:58.510
<b>His form and name have been passed down from generation to generation.</b>

19:58.510 --> 20:02.930
<b>There only have been a few people who actually met him in the past.</b>

20:02.930 --> 20:07.180
<b>Those few have learned
 of the Spirit King's intentions.</b>

20:07.180 --> 20:11.440
<b>They have kept humanity 
and the world in harmony.</b>

20:11.440 --> 20:14.400
<b>When people follow their own desires,</b>

20:14.400 --> 20:17.190
<b>they let their greed lead them down the path of destruction.</b>

20:17.190 --> 20:18.900
<b>Hey, Grandpa!</b>

20:18.900 --> 20:22.200
<b>Who was that guy who said he met the King of the Spirits?</b>

20:22.200 --> 20:24.540
<b>Well,</b>

20:24.540 --> 20:32.590
<b>humans who have mastered all the powers of the shaman, can become one with the King of Spirits.</b>

20:32.590 --> 20:37.090
<b>Historically, they were called saviors.</b>

20:39.010 --> 20:42.890
<b>Well, that's not really important to you, is it?</b>

20:42.890 --> 20:46.140
<b>That's so cool!</b>

20:46.140 --> 20:49.230
<b>Can I be one too? Be the Shaman King?</b>

20:50.520 --> 20:53.690
<b>I don't think that's possible.</b>

20:53.690 --> 20:58.860
<b>What's the matter? I didn't think 
you'd be interested in this kind of talk.</b>

20:58.860 --> 21:03.700
<b>If I make friends with that
 King of Spirits, who knows everything,</b>

21:03.700 --> 21:07.660
<b>you'll be able to live a comfortable life with no hardships, right?</b>

21:08.120 --> 21:11.250
<b>Tell me how to become the Shaman King!</b>

21:11.250 --> 21:13.630
<b>I'll train properly!</b>

<b>Thank goodness!</b>

<b>So that's what that guy was talking
 about when he said King of the Shamans.</b>

21:27.600 --> 21:29.890
<b>You mean the Shaman King?</b>

21:29.890 --> 21:31.270
<b>What?</b>

21:31.270 --> 21:34.150
<b>I wanted to become the 
Shaman King in the first place.</b>

21:34.150 --> 21:36.480
<b>That's why I started my training.</b>

21:36.480 --> 21:40.070
<b>Before I knew it, the training itself had become my goal.</b>

21:40.070 --> 21:42.950
<b>I didn't know that, but I'm glad you're okay.</b>

21:40.280 --> 21:42.950
<b>Wait a minute! I said wait!</b>

21:42.950 --> 21:45.320
<b>Tell me exactly what the Shaman King is!</b>

<b>I couldn't feel like I was alive.</b>
