WEBVTT

00:01.777 --> 00:02.375
Hey, guys! I'm Paige.

00:02.411 --> 00:03.718
I'm Frankie.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.646
Both: And we're Bizaardvark!

00:05.681 --> 00:08.106
Today, we are going to be doing
the No Thumbs Challenge,

00:08.141 --> 00:10.409
where we attempt
to do everyday things

00:10.444 --> 00:12.335
with no thumbs!

00:12.371 --> 00:14.629
Let's do this!
So that's supposed

00:14.664 --> 00:16.509
to be a... a thumbs up, but,
you know, the thumb thing.

00:16.533 --> 00:18.959
Both: Texting!

00:18.994 --> 00:20.063
I'm gonna text you, "Cool shirt
and I love your new haircut."

00:20.087 --> 00:21.903
Oops! (Smash)

00:21.938 --> 00:23.397
Cool 3gErt.

00:23.432 --> 00:24.773
It says "Cool 3gErt" right now.

00:24.808 --> 00:26.133
Both: Sandwich eating!

00:26.168 --> 00:27.935
- Do the whole hand.
- Here we go.

00:27.970 --> 00:29.619
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:29.654 --> 00:30.454
Need help?

00:30.489 --> 00:32.071
Ahh... Ahh...

00:32.107 --> 00:33.515
Ahh!

00:33.550 --> 00:34.616
(Frankie speaks)

00:34.652 --> 00:35.692
(Paige speaks)

00:35.727 --> 00:36.918
(both speaking)

00:36.954 --> 00:39.579
I call this the Frankie Special.

00:39.615 --> 00:42.407
- What does that mean?
- It means that I'm just gonna improvise it.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.484
- Oh!
- I'm just gonna make it up.

00:44.519 --> 00:46.973
- I just need to do the finishing touch.
- H... How does it look?

00:46.997 --> 00:48.271
- Which is a nice pull.
- Aah!

00:48.307 --> 00:50.699
It looks... great!

00:50.734 --> 00:52.209
Frankie, this isn't
even a braid!

00:52.244 --> 00:53.685
(both speaking)

00:53.720 --> 00:55.546
- Ah...!
- (laughs)

00:55.581 --> 00:57.222
(both speaking)

00:57.258 --> 00:59.975
If you can...

01:00.010 --> 01:02.127
I'm gonna make you,
but only in colors.

01:02.162 --> 01:03.429
Whoa.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.855
(both groaning)

01:05.890 --> 01:07.290
Both: Thumb wrestling!

01:07.325 --> 01:09.076
- Okay.
- Both: One, two, three, four,

01:09.111 --> 01:10.502
I declare thumb war!

01:10.538 --> 01:11.887
- Fi...
- Frankie.

01:11.922 --> 01:12.229
- What?
- This is a really bad idea.

01:12.264 --> 01:15.298
- That's true. We didn't think this one out.
- Nope.

01:15.333 --> 01:16.519

Uh-huh.

I also wonder if they used it to
store feet, 'cause, uh... (sniffs)

02:16.295 --> 02:17.627
Oh! My eyes!

02:19.231 --> 02:21.089
Cool. I'll be there.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.560
Paige. I see you're staring
at Reese.

02:25.596 --> 02:27.437
No, I wasn't.

02:27.472 --> 02:29.622
I... I just can't stop
looking at... Reese.

02:29.658 --> 02:31.517
I mean, uh... Reese.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.910
I mean... Reese.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.663
I'm starin' at Reese.

02:36.699 --> 02:37.926
Paige, you've been
crushing on this guy

02:37.950 --> 02:38.865
since the first week of school.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.416
Go talk to him already.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.613
I'll stand next to you
and act weird,

02:41.637 --> 02:43.252
so you look awesome
by comparison.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.220
So how you normally act,
but over there?

02:44.256 --> 02:45.280
Yeah, pretty much.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.577
Hey, Reese.

02:50.612 --> 02:51.928
Oh, hey, Paige.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.538
My favorite food is bubble bath!

02:55.492 --> 02:56.708
Okay, Frankie.

02:58.971 --> 03:01.796
So, uh, what are you
up to this weekend?

03:01.831 --> 03:03.815
My middle name
is just a long, honking sound.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.860
Frankie Hooooonk Wong.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.004
(school bell rings)

03:09.039 --> 03:10.347
Okay, Frankie,
that was the bell.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.226
All right, I...
guess I'll see you.

03:15.262 --> 03:18.080
Yeah, yeah, um...
Unless I see you.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.622
Or we see each other.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.549
Or like, make a plan
to see each other.

03:21.584 --> 03:24.144
Paige.
I'd love to hang out with you.

03:24.179 --> 03:25.612
Cool.

03:25.647 --> 03:27.122
Just one thing.

03:27.157 --> 03:29.132
If we hang out,
you're not gonna, like,

03:29.167 --> 03:31.045
use me for material in one
of your Bizaardvark videos,

03:31.069 --> 03:34.011
- are you?
- What? No.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.938
No, no, we would never do that.

03:35.974 --> 03:38.758
Cool, it would just make me a
little uncomfortable, you know?

03:38.794 --> 03:41.678
Totally. Um, don't worry, Frankie
and I know where to draw the line.

03:41.713 --> 03:43.850
The government took out my insides and
replaced them with robot kitten parts!

03:43.874 --> 03:47.017
Me-Ow! Me-Ow!

03:47.052 --> 03:49.678
- Me-Ow...
- Frankie, he said yes.

03:49.713 --> 03:51.429
You're welcome.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.586
Man, I've missed
your fish sticks, Wanda.

03:57.621 --> 04:00.146
When I make 'em at home,
I always burn the box.

04:02.534 --> 04:06.069
Wow. Sure is cold in here.

04:06.104 --> 04:08.613
Good thing I have this Sierra
High Wrestling Team jacket.

04:08.649 --> 04:12.651
The one that you can only get if you're super
cool and are on the school wrestling team.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.244
Sweet! So how'd you get it?

04:16.289 --> 04:18.999
Dirk, I'm on the team.

04:19.034 --> 04:21.635
W... I mean, I haven't
actually wrestled anybody yet,

04:21.670 --> 04:23.361
because nobody
in the district besides me

04:23.396 --> 04:27.090
is in the "under 79-pound"
weight class, but...

04:27.125 --> 04:29.960
it's probably 'cause
they're too scared!

04:29.995 --> 04:33.046
Which means I'm undefeated!

04:33.081 --> 04:34.481
- Well, technically...
- Undefeated!

04:37.252 --> 04:39.289
And the best part is, being on the
team is getting me tons of attention

04:39.313 --> 04:41.688
from shallow girls who otherwise
wouldn't look at me.

04:43.591 --> 04:46.810
- Oooooh.
- Ahhh?

04:46.845 --> 04:49.771
- Eww.
- Aww...

04:49.806 --> 04:51.731
Ooooh.

04:51.766 --> 04:53.892
Yeah!

04:53.927 --> 04:57.979
Hey, Amelia, where do you think I should
have them stitch "Bernie Undefeated Schotz"?

04:58.015 --> 05:00.398
Wait. Undefeated?

05:00.433 --> 05:03.351
As in you have a...
perfect record?

05:03.386 --> 05:05.912
Bernie, I'm impressed.

05:05.948 --> 05:07.500
Do you wanna come to a party
with me this weekend?

05:07.524 --> 05:10.183
A party? With you?

05:10.218 --> 05:12.886
Bernie's in the house!

05:12.921 --> 05:15.188
All: Wooooo!

05:15.223 --> 05:15.980
Deep Male Voice:
It's a perfect party.

05:16.015 --> 05:18.625
(dance music playing)

05:18.660 --> 05:19.976
I'm not wearing my retainer!

05:20.011 --> 05:22.237
All: Wooooo!

05:22.272 --> 05:23.071
Deep Male Voice:
It's a perfect party.

05:23.106 --> 05:26.040
(dance music playing)

05:26.076 --> 05:28.235
I brought my grandma's kugel!

05:28.270 --> 05:30.495
All: Wooooo!

05:30.530 --> 05:31.496
Deep Male Voice:
It's a perfect party.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.490
(dance music playing)

05:36.452 --> 05:38.753
Wait. Where'd Amelia go?

05:38.789 --> 05:41.681
She left like five minutes ago
'cause you were doing this:

05:41.716 --> 05:44.236
Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz,
oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz...

05:48.632 --> 05:52.358
Uugh! We need to post a new
video, and all our ideas stink.

05:52.394 --> 05:58.781
No... bad...
poodles made o'noodles?

05:58.816 --> 06:00.787
Just 'cause it rhymes doesn't
mean it's funny, Frankie.

06:00.811 --> 06:03.252
(phone rings)

06:03.288 --> 06:05.080
(gasp) It's Reese!

06:05.115 --> 06:06.664
We're meeting at five!

06:06.700 --> 06:07.348
What time were you
supposed to meet?

06:07.383 --> 06:08.383
Five!

06:10.579 --> 06:13.412
Wait a minute, this is perfect.

06:13.448 --> 06:14.717
You're hanging out with a guy
for the first time, which means,

06:14.741 --> 06:18.885
there's bound to be awkwardness,
and awkwardness leads to comedy,

06:18.921 --> 06:21.997
and then, bam!
We've got video ideas.

06:22.032 --> 06:25.008
No, I... I told Reese I wouldn't use
him as material in any of our videos.

06:25.043 --> 06:28.320
Why would you do that?

06:28.355 --> 06:30.096
What's even the point
of going out with him?

06:30.132 --> 06:34.376
Wow, we are really developing
at different rates emotionally.

06:34.411 --> 06:35.960
I'm just saying
keep an open mind.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.299
I mean, something's bound to happen
when you're with Reese that'll give us

06:38.323 --> 06:40.423
a great video idea.

06:40.459 --> 06:42.228
- Here, take a pen.
- No! I'm not hanging out with Reese

06:42.252 --> 06:43.951
to get Bizaardvark material.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.629
Okay, fine, you're right.
I'm sorry.

06:46.665 --> 06:49.157
Thank you.

06:49.192 --> 06:51.084
- So, what should I wear?
- A wire.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.000
So I can listen in
and get Bizaardvark material.

06:58.777 --> 07:01.202
There he is. I just came by to
see my little wrestlin' bro

07:01.238 --> 07:02.620
doin' some of his moves.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.581
I'm doin' 'em right now.

07:04.616 --> 07:07.000
I call this one the "Double
Energy Bar Takedown."

07:09.955 --> 07:12.122
- (blowing whistle)
- All right!

07:12.157 --> 07:14.549
- (clapping)
- Yes! Still undefeated!

07:14.584 --> 07:17.927
Woooo! Bern-man! Bern-man!
Bern-man...

07:17.963 --> 07:20.396
Dude! Dude! Stop! Put me down!

07:20.432 --> 07:21.693
The doctor says I can't be more
than four inches off the ground.

07:21.717 --> 07:22.717
It's an inner ear thing!

07:27.656 --> 07:30.023
What the...? Did that fourth
grader just pin Dirk?

07:32.460 --> 07:36.446
Uh, I'm actually
in ninth grade, sir.

07:36.481 --> 07:38.959
And to think we've been lettin' your
talents go to waste on the bench!

07:38.983 --> 07:41.484
We need to get you out there
on the mats!

07:41.520 --> 07:43.411
On the mats, like,
where the wrestling happens?

07:45.716 --> 07:48.166
You know, I'd love to,
but as you know,

07:48.201 --> 07:52.378
district rules state that you have
to wrestle within your weight class,

07:52.414 --> 07:55.494
and I'm still clockin' in under 79 pounds,
so I can't really wr... Okay, okay.

07:58.286 --> 08:00.353
Says here you're 82 pounds!

08:00.388 --> 08:04.065
82 pounds? How is that possible?

08:04.101 --> 08:06.859
All I've been doing is sitting
here eating energy bars,

08:06.895 --> 08:09.095
drinking protein shakes, never
moving my body and... Oh.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.190
I remember when I was 82 pounds,

08:12.225 --> 08:15.109
the doctor said I was the biggest
two-year-old he'd ever seen.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.571
Good story, Dirk.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.043
There's plenty of kids
in your weight class, son.

08:23.119 --> 08:24.994
I'm startin' you in our next match!
(chuckles)

08:27.348 --> 08:29.181
- (Bernie grunts)
- (whistle blowing)

08:29.217 --> 08:32.135
How are you in my weight class?

08:32.170 --> 08:34.504
(applause and cheering)

08:34.539 --> 08:37.006
Hey, are you going
to the party this weekend?

08:37.041 --> 08:39.100
(deep male voice)
It's a perfect party.

08:39.135 --> 08:40.301
(dance music playing)

08:45.291 --> 08:46.849
Thanks for the boba, Reese.

08:49.129 --> 08:52.038
Boba. (Laughs)
That's a funny word.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.557
Hey, let's have a conversation
just using the word "boba."

08:54.592 --> 08:57.585
Ooh, fun. I'll start.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.428
Boba, bah-boba,
bah-boba, bah-boba.

08:59.464 --> 09:01.047
Boba, boba, boba.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.082
Bah-boba!

09:04.294 --> 09:08.788
Boba, boba boba boba,
boba, boba boba.

09:08.823 --> 09:10.431
What'd you say?

09:10.467 --> 09:12.509
"Isn't it crazy that pigeons
are birds?

09:12.544 --> 09:15.462
'Cause they look like rats.
With wings!"

09:15.497 --> 09:18.081
What'd you say?

09:18.116 --> 09:20.877
I said, "You look really pretty
tonight, and I'm havin' a lot of fun."

09:22.237 --> 09:23.761
Boba...

09:26.791 --> 09:28.436
(to herself)
What was Frankie talking about?

09:28.460 --> 09:31.678
Hanging with Reese isn't
giving me any video ideas.

09:31.713 --> 09:35.247
What does she want me to do, make a video
called "Having Fun with an Awesome Guy"?

09:35.283 --> 09:36.599
Wait, could that be something?

09:36.634 --> 09:39.594
Nah...

09:39.629 --> 09:41.698
Hey, did you know I could read
palms and tell the future?

09:41.722 --> 09:42.780
Really?

09:45.827 --> 09:48.578
Let's see, you'll have
a very long and happy life...

09:50.424 --> 09:54.041
Okay, I don't know
how to read palms.

09:54.077 --> 09:55.718
I just wanted to hold your hand.

09:55.754 --> 09:58.504
I, uh... boba.

10:00.792 --> 10:02.383
We should hang out again.

10:02.419 --> 10:04.143
What do you think, Roger?

10:04.179 --> 10:05.637
Who's Roger?

10:05.672 --> 10:10.433
Oh, sorry, I can't believe
I haven't introduced you two.

10:10.468 --> 10:14.646
He's my best buddy, Roger.
I take him everywhere I go.

10:17.492 --> 10:20.276
(to herself) Oh, no. A guy who's
best friend is a caterpillar?

10:20.312 --> 10:24.113
(gasp) Funniest video idea ever!

10:24.148 --> 10:26.407
<i>♪ When you're hanging out
and you're havin' a ball ♪</i>

10:26.443 --> 10:28.709
<i>♪ Roger's here to ruin it all ♪</i>

10:28.744 --> 10:30.870
Ohh! Hey-hey, I'm Roger!

10:35.109 --> 10:39.645
This movie's great! Turns out
he's the bad guy and she dies!

10:39.681 --> 10:41.798
Ooh! Let me have some of that.

10:41.833 --> 10:44.217
(eating sounds)

10:46.396 --> 10:48.521
Hey, what're you thinking about?

10:48.598 --> 10:52.125
Uhh... Uh, I just... I really
like Roger, and um...

10:52.160 --> 10:53.668
I wanna stare at him
a little more.

10:53.703 --> 10:55.103
Yeah. He gets that a lot.

10:57.716 --> 11:00.191
So, keep hanging out
with a really great guy,

11:00.226 --> 11:04.920
or make a hilarious video that'll
end things with a really great guy.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.740
Looks like you got a dilemma!

11:12.914 --> 11:15.075
Hey, I'm Amelia, and I'm here
with my friends Bernie and Dirk

11:15.099 --> 11:16.515
to do the Box Ball Challenge

11:16.551 --> 11:18.001
Bernie, tell 'em how it works.

11:18.036 --> 11:20.086
I do not know.

11:20.121 --> 11:22.196
- Here we go!
- No, I gotta tell him how it works.

11:22.231 --> 11:23.797
So, we each take
empty tissue boxes,

11:23.833 --> 11:25.566
tie it behind our backs,

11:25.602 --> 11:26.971
fill them
with eight ping pong balls,

11:26.995 --> 11:29.245
then we dance
until all the balls fall out.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.599
- I still don't get it.
- Here we go!

11:30.623 --> 11:32.557
Don't tell Bernie,

11:32.592 --> 11:34.475
but we secretly
taped his tissue box closed

11:34.511 --> 11:35.791
so that the balls
can't come out!

11:38.456 --> 11:39.856
<i>- Go. Go.
- Gonna beat both y'all.</i>

11:39.891 --> 11:41.541
No, I'm winning.

11:41.576 --> 11:42.984
What's wrong, Bernie?

11:43.019 --> 11:44.903
Havin' trouble?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.078
(buzzer sounds)

11:46.113 --> 11:47.405
Guys, that's not funny.

11:47.441 --> 11:50.224
- We know.
- (Dirk and Amelia laugh)

11:50.260 --> 11:52.213
That's why when we edit this, we're
gonna do stuff to totally goof on you!

11:52.237 --> 11:53.277
- (Amelia laughs)
- Oh, no.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.379
So, how was it?

12:03.415 --> 12:05.214
Any good video material?

12:05.249 --> 12:09.026
Not at all. Reese is awesome
and totally normal.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.788
We talked about school,
he said I looked pretty,

12:11.823 --> 12:14.540
his best friend's a caterpillar,
he read my palm.

12:14.576 --> 12:17.827
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:17.862 --> 12:20.796
I know, it was a cheesy way for him to
hold my hand, but it worked for me.

12:20.831 --> 12:22.456
His best friend
is a caterpillar?

12:22.492 --> 12:24.317
Ohhhh, we are making a video!

12:26.562 --> 12:30.064
What? It's not that weird
that he has a caterpillar.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.744
And if you take off the
"erpillar", it's just a cat.

12:31.768 --> 12:32.784
Yeah. But it's not a cat!

12:35.038 --> 12:38.256
Okay, it's super weird,
but I told Reese

12:38.333 --> 12:40.508
I wouldn't use him as material
in any of our videos.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.835
And if we make this video,
he'll know it's about him,

12:42.870 --> 12:44.712
and he won't wanna
hang out with me anymore.

12:44.747 --> 12:46.096
And I like him.

12:46.132 --> 12:49.458
Uh... I'm sorry, Paige, I didn't
hear a word you just said.

12:49.493 --> 12:51.981
I literally just came up with 15 videos
about Reese and his caterpillar.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.846
- Whose name is Roger.
- Ha! 16!

12:57.060 --> 12:58.993
Wait, he didn't feed him
any of the boba, did he?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.228
- A little.
- Oh! 17!

13:02.298 --> 13:04.306
Frankie, come on,
I need your help.

13:04.342 --> 13:06.551
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm not
trying to be insensitive.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.946
And I'll... I'll let this whole
thing go if you can just

13:09.981 --> 13:11.375
look me in the eye and tell me you
haven't thought about all the videos

13:11.399 --> 13:12.782
we could make.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.543
I...

13:15.578 --> 13:17.511
- have not...
- Paige.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.238
- Been thinking...
- Paige.

13:19.274 --> 13:21.154
About... Fine!
I already wrote the first draft.

13:22.928 --> 13:25.119
Roger's the annoying best friend
who won't go away.

13:25.155 --> 13:29.098
And for some reason, I... I
imagine he talks like this:

13:29.134 --> 13:31.567
Hey-hey, I'm Roger. I threw
all your mail in the trash.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.303
(Frankie laughs) I love it!

13:34.338 --> 13:37.031
Hey-hey-hey, I'm Roger.
Someone pooped in your yard.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.643
It was me. (Giggles)

13:40.678 --> 13:42.970
So when do we
shoot this thing, tomorrow?

13:43.005 --> 13:44.600
I don't know, Frankie. I... I'm not sure
what the right thing to do here is.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.925
Hey-hey, you know what's
always the right thing to do?

13:47.960 --> 13:49.240
Playing your tuba
in the library.

13:50.780 --> 13:52.129
Come on, Frankie, I'm serious.

13:52.164 --> 13:55.783
- I... I can't do this...
- Hey-hey! You know what I can't do?

13:55.819 --> 13:57.743
Sing. But that doesn't stop me.

13:57.779 --> 14:00.988
(off key) La la la la laaaaaaa!

14:01.023 --> 14:03.474
(laughs)

14:03.510 --> 14:06.744
Okay, okay. You convinced me.

14:06.779 --> 14:12.867
I like Reese a lot... but this video
idea could be too funny to let go of.

14:12.902 --> 14:14.379
I guess I'll tell him
we can't hang out anymore.

14:14.403 --> 14:16.653
Great.
Let me know if he cries funny.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.849
We might be able to use that.

14:21.553 --> 14:23.686
All: And gooooo Hawks!

14:26.958 --> 14:28.132
Schotz...

14:28.167 --> 14:30.810
Just wanna let you know who
you'll be wrestlin' tomorrow.

14:30.845 --> 14:33.345
They call him "The Brick."

14:33.381 --> 14:37.709
Do they call him "The Brick" because
he's small and rectangular?

14:37.785 --> 14:40.194
No. They call him that
because he once ate a brick.

14:40.229 --> 14:41.186
The kid's psycho!

14:41.222 --> 14:42.222
(laughing)

14:45.477 --> 14:47.988
I've never wrestled before, and now
I've gotta go against "The Brick."

14:48.012 --> 14:52.314
Oh. Tough break.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.589
That's what "The Brick" says
when he snaps people's legs!

14:56.946 --> 15:00.114
Aw, man, there is no way
I can beat this guy.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.483
Amelia and the entire school
are gonna think I'm a loser.

15:02.518 --> 15:04.185
Don't worry, Bern-man.

15:05.980 --> 15:08.230
Whoa. That's a lotta sweat!

15:12.236 --> 15:15.079
I think I have an idea
of how you can win tomorrow!

15:15.156 --> 15:18.708
Yeah! You dress up like me
and wrestle in my place.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.423
Our faces and muscles
are the same, it's...

15:21.537 --> 15:22.537
Nah, that wouldn't work.

15:23.957 --> 15:24.957
The hair...

15:28.819 --> 15:30.205
Did you tell Reese you couldn't
hang out with him anymore?

15:30.229 --> 15:32.229
Yeah. I put it off all day,

15:32.264 --> 15:35.858
but I finally looked him in the
eye and told him the truth.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.802
"My mom says
I can't hang out with you."

15:40.649 --> 15:42.973
I'm not sure, but I think
I made the right choice.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.850
Hey, questionable good choice
high-five!

15:53.436 --> 15:56.476
Hey-hey, I'm Roger! Who wants to go to
the hospital and switch up the babies?

15:58.458 --> 16:03.310
- Hey, Frankie...
- Heyyyyyy, Reese! What's up?

16:03.345 --> 16:06.964
I know Paige can't hang out with me anymore,
but I already got her a couple gifts.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.891
Would you mind
giving them to her for me?

16:08.926 --> 16:11.347
(to herself) He hangs out with Paige
one time and he gets her gifts?

16:11.371 --> 16:13.328
These oughta be original.

16:13.364 --> 16:15.355
I got her chocolates
in the shape of turtles,

16:15.391 --> 16:17.366
'cause I know Paige's fantasy

16:17.401 --> 16:19.585
is to ride a turtle
to an undersea kingdom.

16:19.620 --> 16:21.303
(to herself)
Okay, points for that.

16:21.338 --> 16:24.490
But he clearly doesn't know
which kingdom.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.661
They're dark chocolate, 'cause that's
the official chocolate of Paige-lantis.

16:26.685 --> 16:27.685
(to herself) Uh-oh.

16:29.505 --> 16:31.731
I also made her a playlist.

16:31.766 --> 16:33.052
(to herself) Please don't be two
hours of tropical rain sounds.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.151
It's three hours
of tropical rain sounds.

16:37.054 --> 16:39.238
(to herself)
Oh no, what did I do?

16:39.273 --> 16:40.884
- She says it calms her...
- Yeah, I know what she says!

16:40.908 --> 16:42.700
Sorry, I meant to...
I meant to think that.

16:45.471 --> 16:46.604
(sighs)

16:46.639 --> 16:49.673
(to herself) Why did I push
Paige to end it with this guy?

16:49.708 --> 16:51.642
He's perfect for her.

16:51.678 --> 16:55.003
Looks like you got a dilemma!

16:55.039 --> 16:56.756
Nobody asked you, Roger!

17:02.638 --> 17:05.615
Okay, the wedding scene.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.512
Ooh remember, when you hear, "Does
anyone object?" you raise all your hands

17:08.536 --> 17:10.895
and say, "I do.
Also, I ate the ring."

17:14.192 --> 17:16.776
This... is way more fun
than hangin' out with Reese.

17:19.847 --> 17:20.858
I made the right decision,
didn't I?

17:20.882 --> 17:22.531
Mm-hmm.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.077
Whoa. What was that?

17:28.623 --> 17:32.408
Look me in the eye and tell
me I made the right choice.

17:32.443 --> 17:34.635
You...

17:34.670 --> 17:35.786
- made...
- Frankie...

17:35.821 --> 17:37.321
- the right...
- Frankie!

17:37.356 --> 17:39.731
Fine!
Hey, Reese is perfect for you!

17:39.767 --> 17:41.709
He made you
a tropical rain playlist.

17:41.744 --> 17:44.911
He has feelings and stuff.

17:44.947 --> 17:46.933
He even gave you a box of chocolate
turtles, but they melted.

17:46.957 --> 17:49.416
In my stomach, I'm sorry.

17:49.451 --> 17:52.161
But he talks to a caterpillar.

17:52.197 --> 17:56.548
So what? Everyone has flaws.
I mean, he talks

17:56.584 --> 17:59.343
to a caterpillar, I'm stubborn
and have anger problems, and...

17:59.378 --> 18:00.858
- But Frankie...
- Don't interrupt me!

18:02.448 --> 18:06.100
Paige, I'm sorry.
Okay... I was selfish.

18:06.135 --> 18:09.361
Sometimes I... I get so
excited about making videos

18:09.396 --> 18:13.173
with my best friend, I don't stop
to think what's best for my friend.

18:13.209 --> 18:16.410
Y... You having fun with Reese is
more important than any video.

18:16.445 --> 18:18.604
So what I do now?

18:18.639 --> 18:20.297
Run to him!

18:25.371 --> 18:27.162
It's almost go-time, B-man.

18:27.197 --> 18:29.898
All we have to do
is get you nervous,

18:29.933 --> 18:32.487
so you get super sweaty, and then "The
Brick" won't be able to get a hold of you.

18:32.511 --> 18:36.138
It's gonna be tough. Now that we
have a plan, I'm not nervous.

18:36.173 --> 18:38.507
Don't worry. I'm on it.

18:38.543 --> 18:40.860
Hey... Oh, wow, oh...

18:42.580 --> 18:46.815
(applause)

18:46.851 --> 18:50.002
I emailed the entire school,
and guaranteed you'd win.

18:50.038 --> 18:54.081
Ahh, jeez...

18:54.116 --> 18:56.586
Also, I reserved front row seats for
Amelia so she'd have the perfect view

18:56.610 --> 18:58.343
of you in action.

18:58.379 --> 19:00.771
Hi, Bernie!

19:00.807 --> 19:02.598
The real ones
are for after you win.

19:02.634 --> 19:06.193
Ahh, jeez...

19:06.229 --> 19:09.088
Also, I told Brick
you insulted his mom.

19:09.123 --> 19:11.115
- (grunt)
- (smash)

19:11.150 --> 19:13.425
Oh, jeez.

19:13.460 --> 19:15.085
Sorry, Mrs. Brick!

19:15.121 --> 19:16.121
(smash)

19:18.124 --> 19:19.732
Yeah, you're ready.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.361
(applause)

19:27.075 --> 19:28.890
Ow!

19:28.926 --> 19:29.926
(blowing whistle)

19:33.188 --> 19:35.581
(splash)

19:35.616 --> 19:37.800
Ewww!

19:37.835 --> 19:39.251
Should've worn a poncho.

19:39.287 --> 19:40.336
You're in the splash zone.

19:44.533 --> 19:46.583
(splash)

19:46.618 --> 19:48.194
Uhh...

19:48.229 --> 19:51.154
It went in my mouth!

19:51.190 --> 19:52.550
I'm gettin' out
of the splash zone!

20:01.792 --> 20:05.302
Is anyone sitting here? I'm tirSeriously!
In' hit See a doctor!

20:05.338 --> 20:06.378
(blowing whistle)

20:06.413 --> 20:08.697
(applause)

20:08.733 --> 20:10.941
- Bernie, you are so...
- Strong.

20:10.976 --> 20:13.744
I know.

20:13.779 --> 20:16.430
So, looks like my record
is still perfect.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.694
What kind of kugel should we
bring to this party tonight?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.659
I'm thinkin' spinach.

20:20.694 --> 20:22.811
Dude, what are you doing?

20:22.847 --> 20:24.930
That was just the first round!

20:24.966 --> 20:27.144
You do know there's more than one
round in a wrestling match, right?

20:27.168 --> 20:28.876
- What?
- (whistle blows)

20:28.911 --> 20:31.620
No, I'm dry, I'm dry! I can't...

20:31.655 --> 20:33.389
Brick, no please, Brick! Oww!

20:36.535 --> 20:38.085
- (whistle blows)
- (crowd groaning)

20:38.120 --> 20:39.687
Aw, I just wanted a jacket.

20:43.634 --> 20:46.318
Hey...

20:46.353 --> 20:48.015
well, at least we still
have the party tonight, right?

20:48.039 --> 20:49.647
What time should I pick you up?

20:49.682 --> 20:52.474
Uh, sorry,
the party was canceled.

20:52.509 --> 20:55.319
Oh. You wanna hang
out at my place?

20:55.354 --> 20:57.705
I can't.
I have to go to the party.

21:00.317 --> 21:04.111
Schotz!
I'm takin' back your jacket.

21:04.146 --> 21:05.946
My four-year-old daughter
wears the same size.

21:10.569 --> 21:14.705
I like boba,
but when you drink it,

21:14.741 --> 21:15.622
doesn't it feel like Both: U're
chewing Eyeballs! Y little...

21:15.658 --> 21:17.666
(laughs)

21:17.701 --> 21:20.961
This is awesome. I'm so glad
your mom changed her mind.

21:20.997 --> 21:23.438
What's that, Roger?

21:23.474 --> 21:24.890
Roger says he's glad too.

21:24.925 --> 21:26.617
Hey, little buddy.

21:26.652 --> 21:32.514
Okay, Reese. Um... I have
to be honest with you.

21:32.550 --> 21:33.974
I lied.

21:34.009 --> 21:35.884
It wasn't my mom, it was me.

21:35.920 --> 21:39.680
- What?
- I like you a lot, and I know I said

21:39.715 --> 21:42.341
I wouldn't use you for material, but...
when I met Roger,

21:42.376 --> 21:46.645
I came up with a great idea
for a video.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.416
But I don't wanna make it if it
means we can't hang out anymore.

21:50.451 --> 21:54.294
Wait, so, what was the idea?

21:54.330 --> 21:57.289
I mean... I didn't really
put too much thought into it...

21:57.324 --> 21:59.191
Okay, we started
with the wedding!

21:59.268 --> 22:00.812
But then in the seventh draft,
we made Roger more

22:00.836 --> 22:02.577
of an obnoxious best friend

22:02.613 --> 22:04.045
who ruins everything. He's like,

22:04.081 --> 22:06.115
Hey-hey, I'm Roger!

22:06.117 --> 22:07.995
I ate all your money
'cause it looked like lettuce.

22:08.019 --> 22:11.003
(laughs) That's hilarious!

22:11.038 --> 22:13.222
You should make that.

22:13.257 --> 22:16.108
Wait, so you're saying
I can make the video,

22:16.143 --> 22:16.933
and we can still hang out?

22:16.969 --> 22:19.378
Of course!

22:19.413 --> 22:20.774
You didn't stress out
about this, did you?

22:20.798 --> 22:22.498
Pshhh! No!

22:26.729 --> 22:30.681
What a lovely place! Great choice,
and thank you for the flowers.

22:30.716 --> 22:34.118
Of course!
Also, I have a surprise for you.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.421
I want you to meet
my best friend.

22:35.445 --> 22:36.887
Wow! I can't wait to meet him.

22:36.922 --> 22:40.999
If he's your best friend,
he must be a total gentleman.

22:41.034 --> 22:45.245
Hey-hey! You must be Paige.
I'm Roger.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.590
Does this rash
look infected to you?

22:47.625 --> 22:51.210
- Uhhh...
- Oh, looks like you guys already ordered, huh?

22:51.245 --> 22:52.528
Don't mind if I do.

22:56.175 --> 22:59.276
You know there's a whole plate
of garlic bread right here.

22:59.312 --> 23:02.688
No no no, that's yours,
didn't wanna be rude.

23:02.723 --> 23:08.018
Uhp, comin' back up.
(spitting up)

23:08.054 --> 23:10.354
Uhp, gotta go use
the little caterpillar's room.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.548
Also known as the booth
in the corner, you know.

23:14.785 --> 23:18.170
Wow, um, he's fun.

23:18.205 --> 23:20.572
I know, right?
So, should we order?

23:20.608 --> 23:23.258
This place has great specials.

23:23.294 --> 23:26.820
Hey, here's something special!
Who am I, take a guess!

23:26.856 --> 23:28.814
Uh, a walrus?

23:28.849 --> 23:30.399
No. (Spitting)

23:32.653 --> 23:34.453
I'm a caterpillar
with bread up his mouth.

23:34.488 --> 23:36.155
What are you, an idiot?

23:36.190 --> 23:37.614
Good one, Roger!

23:40.970 --> 23:42.536
Whoop, cocoonin'!

23:48.636 --> 23:52.045
Finally, a quiet moment
for the two of us to talk.

23:52.081 --> 23:53.397
I've been meaning to tell you...

23:53.432 --> 23:56.816
(screaming)

23:56.852 --> 24:03.064
Feels good to stretch 'em out!
