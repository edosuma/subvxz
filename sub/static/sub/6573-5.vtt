WEBVTT

00:09.948 --> 00:12.117
MAN (over radio):
Keep your eyes open.

00:14.369 --> 00:16.580
All right, guys, what do we got?

00:16.622 --> 00:17.914
It's quiet out there.

00:17.956 --> 00:19.458
(over radio):
Stand by.

00:19.499 --> 00:20.667
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:20.709 --> 00:23.545
Yeah, we, uh,
we better be ready.

00:23.587 --> 00:25.004
Yeah, I'm a man.

00:25.046 --> 00:27.299
Don't make it look like makeup.

00:28.389 --> 00:30.099
- (vehicle approaching)
- Car.

00:30.141 --> 00:31.726
Car.

00:31.768 --> 00:34.312
Is that guy one of ours?

00:34.354 --> 00:37.148
Look at the license plate.

00:37.190 --> 00:40.026
Looks like we got ourselves
an anus tart.

00:40.067 --> 00:43.780
NARRATOR: Tobias Funke
was on his way to reconnect

00:43.822 --> 00:45.699
with a daughter
he'd lost touch with.

00:45.740 --> 00:46.700
Hey, there.

00:46.741 --> 00:48.326
It's Big Daddy.

00:48.368 --> 00:51.454
I thought I'd try to call you
before I surprised you.

00:51.496 --> 00:54.749
Things are...
really looking up, and...

00:54.791 --> 00:55.667
(phone beeps)

00:55.709 --> 00:57.168
Hello? Oh, damn it.

00:57.210 --> 00:59.253
What Sudden Valley does
to these cell phones.

00:59.295 --> 01:00.380
Oops.

01:00.421 --> 01:02.215
Unbeknownst to Tobias, however,

01:02.256 --> 01:05.009
the Sudden Valley home
he was on his way to visit...

01:05.051 --> 01:06.927
Anus tart is turning
on Tracey Lane.

01:06.969 --> 01:09.389
...had been rented out
to a television crew.

01:09.430 --> 01:10.473
He's creeping up George Michael.

01:10.515 --> 01:11.891
All right, guys, let's entrap

01:11.932 --> 01:13.309
a local predator.

01:13.351 --> 01:14.728
Come on. Lowlife.

01:14.769 --> 01:16.813
We got to put
this piece of (bleep)...

01:16.855 --> 01:18.255
Who, what, when,
where, why and how.

01:18.272 --> 01:19.607
Who, what, where, when,
why and how.

01:19.649 --> 01:22.276
Who, what, when,
where, why and how.

01:24.028 --> 01:25.946
MAN (over radio): Anus tart is
approaching the portico.

01:25.988 --> 01:28.742
NARRATOR: Yes, Tobias was
finally about to get

01:28.783 --> 01:31.745
a starring role
on a hit TV show.

01:31.786 --> 01:35.122
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

01:35.164 --> 01:37.124
BEARD: And now the story
of the awful people

01:37.166 --> 01:39.544
who are about to lose
everything, and the one newsman

01:39.586 --> 01:42.088
who had no choice but to
entrap them all together.

01:42.129 --> 01:46.092
It's John Beard's To Entrap
a Local Predator, "Supercreeps."

01:46.133 --> 01:48.177
NARRATOR:
Now the story of a family

01:48.219 --> 01:51.431
whose future
was abruptly cancelled,

01:51.472 --> 01:53.391
and the one son-in-law
who had no choice

01:53.433 --> 01:54.934
but to keep himself together.

01:58.157 --> 02:01.315
It's Tobias's
Arrested Development.

02:04.652 --> 02:09.407
Five years before Tobias was to
appear on John Beard's TV show,

02:09.449 --> 02:11.743
his acting career
was as washed up...

02:11.785 --> 02:13.745
- None taken.
- ...as his family...

02:13.787 --> 02:15.455
You are soaked to the bone.

02:15.496 --> 02:17.957
...and those men he was
touching for some reason.

02:17.998 --> 02:19.834
And his wife challenged him

02:19.876 --> 02:22.420
to reexamine the other parts
of his life as well.

02:22.462 --> 02:24.130
There's nothing
keeping us together.

02:24.171 --> 02:27.091
It's time to give up our dreams
if they're not working.

02:27.133 --> 02:28.885
You know, your acting career,

02:28.927 --> 02:31.512
this marriage
that everyone thinks is a sham

02:31.554 --> 02:32.639
because you're gay.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.307
I-I'm sorry.

02:34.348 --> 02:37.518
Everyone thinks I'm gay?

02:37.560 --> 02:41.940
Well, I mean, it's kind of
a running joke in the family.

02:41.981 --> 02:44.776
I mean, y-you know that, right?

02:44.818 --> 02:47.069
'Cause of the misleading way
you talk sometimes.

02:47.111 --> 02:50.364
Oh, you're saying the way I talk
makes me sound gay?

02:50.406 --> 02:51.658
(chuckles)
When in the last year

02:51.699 --> 02:54.243
have I said anything
remotely mis...

02:54.285 --> 02:56.995
♪ It's just a fallacy! ♪

02:57.037 --> 02:59.874
...leading? Is this because
I want to be an actor,

02:59.916 --> 03:01.584
and all the leading men
in Hollywood are gay?

03:01.626 --> 03:03.419
I don't think
that all the leading men

03:03.461 --> 03:04.504
in Hollywood are gay.

03:04.545 --> 03:06.046
- Oh, honey.
- (sighs)

03:06.088 --> 03:08.758
Look, we're chasing things
that aren't real.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.511
Maybe we need to go out there
and find out

03:11.552 --> 03:13.095
what we're meant to do.

03:13.137 --> 03:16.599
His wife was giving him
the cold shoulder.

03:16.641 --> 03:18.225
And after kissing it good-bye,

03:18.267 --> 03:22.146
he sat with her family,
feeling lost...

03:22.188 --> 03:25.023
Well, you look like I feel.

03:25.065 --> 03:26.943
...and very misunderstood.

03:26.985 --> 03:28.361
Gay?

03:28.402 --> 03:30.446
No, I...

03:30.488 --> 03:31.865
No.

03:31.906 --> 03:34.492
Tobias knew
it was time to find out

03:34.534 --> 03:35.734
what he was truly meant to do.

03:35.743 --> 03:37.829
So when he came across a book

03:37.871 --> 03:40.080
the universe
had placed in his path,

03:40.122 --> 03:41.415
he was open to its inspiration.

03:41.457 --> 03:43.543
Oh, they're still reading,
but...

03:43.584 --> 03:45.795
well, I guess I can
leave them some love.

03:45.837 --> 03:47.839
So he just took
"eat" and "pray."

03:49.841 --> 03:51.425
"Eat" was easy,

03:51.467 --> 03:54.804
although it provided
no cosmic answers for him.

03:54.846 --> 03:58.016
But it was the part about India
that really got to him.

03:58.057 --> 04:00.518
And so, like the heroine
of Eat, Pray,

04:00.560 --> 04:02.436
- Tobias decided
- Wait a minute.

04:02.478 --> 04:05.565
to get as far away
from his wife as possible.

04:07.149 --> 04:12.196
And so Tobias found himself
booking passage to India.

04:12.238 --> 04:14.991
And soon, he discovered
his wife was also

04:15.033 --> 04:16.951
preparing to go somewhere...

04:16.993 --> 04:18.911
- I think you have my suitcase.
- ...far away.

04:18.952 --> 04:20.914
(sighs)
I'm so sorry, Tobias.

04:20.954 --> 04:22.248
Look, I've already packed.

04:22.289 --> 04:23.249
Can I just use this one?

04:23.290 --> 04:25.084
Oh, what the heck.

04:25.125 --> 04:28.379
I guess having matching luggage
isn't so romantic anymore.

04:28.421 --> 04:30.048
And these romantic gestures are

04:30.089 --> 04:32.717
possibly why people think
I'm a homosexual.

04:32.759 --> 04:36.512
Well, it's time to correct
old misconceptions.

04:36.554 --> 04:38.932
And that is why
I'm making a new start.

04:38.973 --> 04:41.350
Oh, a new start.

04:41.392 --> 04:43.895
Filled with compassion and love.

04:43.937 --> 04:45.271
I like that.

04:45.312 --> 04:46.689
Well, I've already got
the license plate,

04:46.731 --> 04:47.815
so go cry in your pie!

04:47.857 --> 04:50.026
And so Tobias, hoping to

04:50.068 --> 04:54.154
"straighten out" his image,
set out on a new start,

04:54.196 --> 04:57.491
beginning with a trip
to the airport in an outfit

04:57.533 --> 04:59.786
he pretty much put together
himself.

04:59.827 --> 05:01.495
Well, I guess this is why

05:01.537 --> 05:02.956
you never see them
driving convertibles.

05:02.997 --> 05:04.457
I'll have to check on that one.

05:04.498 --> 05:06.542
But it certainly
wasn't embraced...

05:06.584 --> 05:07.919
Stay in your lane, anus tart!

05:07.961 --> 05:09.295
(bleep) anus tart!

05:09.336 --> 05:10.713
...by the local
Indian community.

05:10.755 --> 05:12.131
You have the true sense
of the oneness of all.

05:12.172 --> 05:14.759
And his quest
hit a bump early on,

05:14.801 --> 05:18.012
as he struggled to learn
the customs and gestures of

05:18.054 --> 05:20.014
- the culture he hoped to adopt.
- Oh, goddamn it!

05:20.056 --> 05:23.101
Am I the only one
who still dresses to fly?

05:23.142 --> 05:25.352
Well, there we go.

05:25.394 --> 05:26.729
India clean.

05:26.771 --> 05:28.147
(chuckles)

05:28.188 --> 05:29.774
Now, how did I...

05:29.816 --> 05:31.067
No. No.

05:31.109 --> 05:33.402
Unfortunately,
recreating the look

05:33.444 --> 05:35.237
- of the traditional Indian garb
- Are you finished? Oh.

05:35.279 --> 05:36.906
turned out to be more
difficult...

05:36.948 --> 05:38.828
I look like one of those
hot guys from Spartacus.

05:38.866 --> 05:42.036
...without the aid of Pradeep,
the helpful Indian salesman...

05:42.078 --> 05:44.246
I feel like there was
less up top.

05:44.288 --> 05:47.207
...at Bed, Bath & Beyond, who
helped him learn how to tie it.

05:47.249 --> 05:48.709
Ah, got it, okay.

05:48.751 --> 05:50.128
(choking)

05:52.046 --> 05:53.589
Yes, I actually
like this better.

05:53.631 --> 05:55.091
- (knocking)
- Yes?

05:57.510 --> 05:58.886
Canadian?

05:58.928 --> 06:00.554
No, I'm American.

06:00.596 --> 06:02.682
Oh, yeah. I'm Canadian.

06:02.723 --> 06:04.058
Oh. Sorry.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.977
But because it was
a long flight,

06:06.019 --> 06:08.688
he figured he'd wait a beat
on finding his true calling

06:08.729 --> 06:10.648
and watch something to
take his mind off Lindsay...

06:10.690 --> 06:13.067
How could they not have
Failure to Launch?

06:13.109 --> 06:15.193
...who he knew was far away
at the time.

06:15.235 --> 06:16.696
(groans)
Goddamn it.

06:17.905 --> 06:19.365
And after taking

06:19.406 --> 06:20.950
the wrong bag at the airport...

06:20.992 --> 06:22.576
WOMAN (over P.A.): Do not leave
any goats unattended.

06:22.618 --> 06:25.997
All unattended goats
will be confiscated.

06:26.039 --> 06:28.374
...Tobias finally arrived...

06:28.415 --> 06:31.002
And so Tobias Funke
embarked on a--

06:31.044 --> 06:34.714
Oh, dear, Lord, it's... hot!

06:34.755 --> 06:37.633
...in India, yes, where he was
very uncomfortable.

06:37.675 --> 06:39.927
Not only because
the wind whipped up

06:39.969 --> 06:42.138
his queen-sized
fitted mini-sarong,

06:42.180 --> 06:44.974
but because he looked
the wrong direction

06:45.016 --> 06:46.216
when stepping into the street.

06:46.224 --> 06:47.434
(tires screeching)

06:47.476 --> 06:49.520
And so Tobias experienced India

06:49.562 --> 06:51.522
from the inside
of a hospital room,

06:51.564 --> 06:53.024
where the staff
was being trained...

06:53.066 --> 06:54.984
This man here broke his skull
in two places.

06:55.026 --> 06:57.277
...by the same doctor
he'd had in America.

06:57.319 --> 06:59.446
Once outside the airport
and once in the elevator

06:59.488 --> 07:02.240
when his sheet got caught and
he was pulled off his gurney.

07:02.282 --> 07:03.409
Literally.

07:03.450 --> 07:04.730
- (laughter)
- Two places indeed.

07:04.744 --> 07:06.328
This is very funny.

07:06.370 --> 07:08.122
It's like that new show
we just caught, Laugh-In.

07:08.164 --> 07:09.456
My name is...

07:09.498 --> 07:11.084
Oh!

07:11.125 --> 07:14.420
Now I've broken my skull
in a third place!

07:14.461 --> 07:17.090
On this elephant guy statue!

07:17.131 --> 07:19.800
Tobias had wanted the universe
to provide him a sign.

07:19.842 --> 07:21.552
You should be a comedy actor.

07:21.594 --> 07:23.721
And finally it had.

07:23.763 --> 07:25.765
This is the sign I've been...
(groans)

07:25.806 --> 07:27.975
Looking for.

07:28.017 --> 07:29.894
And after two more weeks
in the hospital,

07:29.936 --> 07:32.105
it was time
for his flight home.

07:32.146 --> 07:34.023
And that's when he got
another sign.

07:34.065 --> 07:35.983
(cell phone ringing)

07:36.025 --> 07:38.569
A call from Lindsay.

07:38.611 --> 07:40.362
Although he wouldn't be able
to reach the phone for hours...

07:40.404 --> 07:42.073
I'm ready to make this work.

07:42.115 --> 07:44.408
...due to his already
weakened spine.

07:44.450 --> 07:45.743
(bell chimes)

07:48.121 --> 07:49.622
NARRATOR:
Tobias and Lindsay

07:49.663 --> 07:51.498
shared the news
of their new start

07:51.540 --> 07:52.917
at a family gathering.

07:52.959 --> 07:54.585
I got the part.

07:54.627 --> 07:56.796
You know, it's funny,
for I, too, find that

07:56.837 --> 07:58.214
I am on a journey.

07:58.256 --> 07:59.548
Although, as we discovered

07:59.590 --> 08:01.467
when our MasterCard bill
came back,

08:01.508 --> 08:03.052
it was the same one she took.

08:03.094 --> 08:04.887
But mine has confirmed
that I should

08:04.929 --> 08:07.306
redouble my efforts to achieve

08:07.347 --> 08:11.269
the unachievable dream
of being an actor.

08:11.310 --> 08:14.105
A journey
that has left me eager

08:14.147 --> 08:17.775
to connect with my true love.

08:17.817 --> 08:20.027
Particularly if she finds her...

08:20.069 --> 08:22.780
way clear to covering
a 2, 000-rupee

08:22.822 --> 08:25.950
City of Hopelessness
hospital debt.

08:25.992 --> 08:28.119
The trick is going to be
getting anyone to believe

08:28.161 --> 08:29.411
that her husband
is straight enough

08:29.453 --> 08:31.330
to have a true love
that's a woman.

08:31.371 --> 08:33.082
What are you implying?

08:33.124 --> 08:35.126
Oh, I don't think there was
any implying going on at all.

08:35.168 --> 08:36.335
Didn't hear any implying.

08:36.376 --> 08:37.544
I wasn't implying.

08:37.586 --> 08:38.921
I'm sorry, Mother.

08:38.962 --> 08:40.506
It's just, I've got
a bit of a stick

08:40.547 --> 08:42.008
up my "bunghole"
about what I've now found

08:42.049 --> 08:43.467
is a running joke about me.

08:43.509 --> 08:45.303
But let's be honest.

08:45.344 --> 08:48.931
For 2, 000 rupees, we'd both
go down on Matthew McConaughey.

08:48.973 --> 08:50.808
(chuckles):
Yes, Michael?

08:50.850 --> 08:52.852
At the time of this
family meeting,

08:52.893 --> 08:54.061
2, 000 rupees was $36.

08:54.103 --> 08:56.022
I wouldn't.

08:56.063 --> 08:58.107
GEORGE SR.:
Of course you wouldn't, Michael.

08:58.149 --> 09:00.109
You never accept help
from anyone.

09:00.151 --> 09:02.402
And hoping to do things
differently this time,

09:02.444 --> 09:05.281
Lindsay immediately started
spending money she didn't have.

09:05.323 --> 09:06.907
JAMES:
Are you ready to make a move?

09:06.949 --> 09:11.537
As you can see,
I'm ready for a lot that's new.

09:11.578 --> 09:13.039
Oh, good heavens.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.041
While Tobias pursued

09:15.082 --> 09:17.043
the life of
a professional actor.

09:17.084 --> 09:19.086
Listen, I'm an actor,
you're an agent.

09:19.128 --> 09:20.213
You do the math.

09:20.254 --> 09:21.714
I want you to represent me.

09:21.755 --> 09:23.924
In other words,
you do the math--

09:23.966 --> 09:25.343
the money, the negotiating.

09:25.384 --> 09:27.427
You know I'm not
that kind of agent, right?

09:27.469 --> 09:29.055
I'm a real estate agent.

09:29.096 --> 09:31.807
I'm a predator; I sell
giant houses to very poor people

09:31.849 --> 09:33.559
who can't afford them
with predatory loans.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.519
No, see, that's the money stuff
I don't understand.

09:35.561 --> 09:37.437
All you need to do
is tell people

09:37.479 --> 09:39.523
what a terrific actor I am,
'cause I can't do it believably.

09:39.565 --> 09:40.900
What do you say?

09:40.941 --> 09:42.651
Sounds like it shouldn't be
too much work.

09:42.693 --> 09:43.819
(laughs):
Huzzah!

09:43.861 --> 09:45.071
Okay, here's the number

09:45.112 --> 09:47.114
of my current agent
Mike Matthews.

09:47.156 --> 09:50.201
He's at Allstate. Fire him.

09:50.243 --> 09:54.205
Tobias started seeing positive
career signs everywhere...

09:54.247 --> 09:55.622
...decorating my quarters.

09:55.664 --> 09:59.085
...he chose to put them.

09:59.126 --> 10:00.920
And at his new agent's
suggestion...

10:00.961 --> 10:02.838
Hi. I'm after pending.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.465
...he even snuck on to a studio
lot to hand out head shots

10:05.507 --> 10:08.719
to extras and other
show business insiders.

10:08.761 --> 10:10.388
Taft-Hartley pending.

10:10.429 --> 10:12.139
Things were
looking up for the Funkes.

10:12.181 --> 10:14.516
They even celebrated
their first

10:14.558 --> 10:16.769
- home-cooked Thanksgiving.
- Including duck l'orange.

10:16.810 --> 10:18.062
- (duck quacking)
- Oh!

10:18.104 --> 10:19.980
- Oh, no!
- (Lindsay screams)

10:20.022 --> 10:22.316
Lindsay!
Lindsay, get the scooper!

10:22.358 --> 10:23.692
Throw oranges at it.

10:23.734 --> 10:25.652
- Hot orange! Hot orange.
- (duck quacking)

10:25.694 --> 10:26.946
All right...

10:26.987 --> 10:28.572
It's throwing its voice!

10:28.614 --> 10:30.157
- MAEBY: Oh!
- TOBIAS: Lindsay!

10:31.325 --> 10:33.411
And so they went

10:33.452 --> 10:36.163
to the Fountain Valley
China Garden instead.

10:36.205 --> 10:39.375
And if the collapse
of the housing market,

10:39.417 --> 10:41.835
- his lack of auditions...
- Tobias Funke.

10:41.877 --> 10:43.796
or even the writers' strike

10:43.837 --> 10:45.881
couldn't deter Tobias
from his dream,

10:45.923 --> 10:47.841
the suicide of his ruined

10:47.883 --> 10:49.843
and despondent agent
certainly could.

10:49.885 --> 10:54.140
I believe he died as a warning,
in a way, his message perhaps

10:54.181 --> 10:56.183
to live within our means

10:56.225 --> 10:59.019
and be realistic
about our lives.

10:59.061 --> 11:00.604
And yet it didn't.

11:00.646 --> 11:03.065
Well, then I shall
redouble my efforts

11:03.107 --> 11:05.943
- so that he died in vain.
- (others gasp)

11:06.902 --> 11:08.279
(stammers)

11:08.321 --> 11:10.030
Meaning he will have led
a pointless life,

11:10.072 --> 11:11.157
is what I mean.

11:11.198 --> 11:12.450
Yes, carry on. Thank you.

11:12.490 --> 11:13.867
And he soon found himself

11:13.909 --> 11:17.288
bringing his wife
to an acting class

11:17.330 --> 11:19.915
in an effort to jump-start
his career and marriage.

11:19.957 --> 11:21.792
If everyone's good,
you'll get your juice.

11:21.834 --> 11:24.337
What did you say the name
of this acting class was again?

11:24.378 --> 11:25.838
Method One Clinic.

11:25.879 --> 11:27.399
LINDSAY:
Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee.

11:27.423 --> 11:30.550
Garden Grove Method One Clinic.

11:30.592 --> 11:32.428
And Tobias found himself
captivated

11:32.470 --> 11:34.096
by one of the monologues.

11:34.138 --> 11:36.807
And I made it in that movie,
the Fantastic Four,

11:36.849 --> 11:39.685
uh, but it wasn't fantastic
for me.

11:39.726 --> 11:41.645
Uh, I got carried away.

11:41.687 --> 11:44.231
And I'm like,
"This (bleep) is (bleep) up,

11:44.273 --> 11:46.692
"and I've got to get
my (bleep) together

11:46.733 --> 11:48.819
or I'm gonna be (bleep), too."

11:48.861 --> 11:51.322
Anyways, now I'm sober,
and I'm trying.

11:51.364 --> 11:53.199
It's... super hard.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.700
- (groans)
- (applause)

11:54.741 --> 11:56.243
Thank you. Thank you.

11:56.285 --> 11:58.536
It was a devastating
and personal story.

11:58.578 --> 12:00.247
Okay, notes:

12:00.289 --> 12:02.416
um, first of all, it seemed
you were slurring a bit there,

12:02.458 --> 12:04.918
and I just think
you'd have so much more fun

12:04.960 --> 12:06.420
punching those... those words.

12:06.462 --> 12:07.838
Get it out there.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.548
"This (bleep)
is (bleep) up, sir."

12:10.590 --> 12:12.550
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm not familiar
with the piece, so...

12:12.592 --> 12:14.470
No, no, that's it.

12:14.512 --> 12:18.224
But I am familiar with your work
in the Fantastic Four, however.

12:18.265 --> 12:20.142
- You've seen that?
- Of course I have.

12:20.184 --> 12:22.269
20 years earlier,
DeBrie Bardeaux

12:22.311 --> 12:24.480
had played Sue Storm
in the low-budget version

12:24.522 --> 12:27.525
of the Fantastic Four, produced
by Imagine Entertainment,

12:27.565 --> 12:29.527
when, during Imagine's
Christmas party,

12:29.567 --> 12:32.488
a drunk lawyer reminded them
they'd lose the rights

12:32.530 --> 12:35.741
if they didn't make the film
in the next six days.

12:35.782 --> 12:40.413
After a two-hour search,
they found their entire cast.

12:40.454 --> 12:43.541
They also proved useful six
days later at the wrap party.

12:43.581 --> 12:46.584
I almost never get recognized
as the Invisible Girl.

12:46.626 --> 12:48.254
I can't believe you saw me.

12:48.295 --> 12:51.048
Well, I-I thought it was
"fantastic."

12:51.090 --> 12:53.133
Actually, most
of the performance

12:53.175 --> 12:54.718
that had so captivated
Tobias...

12:54.760 --> 12:56.512
Hey, maybe she came into
this Light Bulbs Unlimited.

12:56.554 --> 12:58.180
She was here a minute ago.

12:58.222 --> 13:00.266
...was performed
by a fishing line.

13:00.307 --> 13:02.518
This is the gayest
Starbucks ever!

13:02.560 --> 13:04.562
Did his fishing line break, too?

13:04.602 --> 13:07.022
DeBRIE:
Well, my acting career is over.

13:07.064 --> 13:10.317
Oh, don't say that. You've got
to say, "Keep the dream alive."

13:10.359 --> 13:11.735
That's what helps me.

13:11.777 --> 13:13.611
Well, this is what's helping me.

13:13.653 --> 13:15.739
- Oh.
- It's really good.

13:15.781 --> 13:17.783
Carl Weathers used to give us
grape juice.

13:17.824 --> 13:20.244
But then he'd add five dollars
to our credit card.

13:20.286 --> 13:22.620
Well, here is to
our acting addiction.

13:22.662 --> 13:23.621
Yep.

13:23.663 --> 13:25.665
May we never be cured.

13:25.707 --> 13:27.960
Are you crying? Oh, I'm crying.

13:28.001 --> 13:30.670
Oh, it's a nosebleed.

13:30.712 --> 13:32.214
(DeBrie gasping)

13:32.256 --> 13:34.467
Oh, thank you so much.

13:34.508 --> 13:36.594
Tobias had found a friend.

13:36.634 --> 13:38.137
- You're neat!
- You're neat.

13:38.178 --> 13:39.555
(laughing):
You're neat.

13:39.597 --> 13:41.056
You're neat.

13:43.850 --> 13:45.727
NARRATOR: And after a
not-very-cute meet-cute,

13:45.769 --> 13:48.272
Tobias continued to find
DeBrie's behavior delightful,

13:48.314 --> 13:50.274
even when the methadone
made her think

13:50.316 --> 13:53.277
she was a piece of toast.

13:53.319 --> 13:55.279
There, now I can see

13:55.321 --> 13:58.240
a pretty face under all that
butter substitute.

13:58.282 --> 14:00.326
And I recognize you
from somewhere,

14:00.367 --> 14:04.037
but it's not the Fantastic Four;
it's from somewhere else.

14:04.079 --> 14:06.499
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.083
Episodics? Been there.

14:08.125 --> 14:11.044
It wasn't episodic.

14:11.086 --> 14:12.588
She had been in a series

14:12.630 --> 14:14.047
of soft-core porn movies
about women

14:14.089 --> 14:15.882
leading straight men
into gay sex,

14:15.924 --> 14:18.135
- called Straight Bait.
- This is my brother. He's gay.

14:18.177 --> 14:19.719
If you want to have sex with me,

14:19.761 --> 14:21.763
then you've got to have sex
with him first.

14:21.805 --> 14:25.142
And if you don't want to have
sex with her, you must be gay.

14:25.184 --> 14:27.353
I'll show you how not gay I am.

14:30.272 --> 14:32.316
She did six of these movies,

14:32.358 --> 14:35.277
and after lunch,
did three more.

14:35.319 --> 14:37.029
It's nice to be
recognized though.

14:37.070 --> 14:38.822
Marky Bark--
sometimes he doesn't know

14:38.864 --> 14:40.907
when I'm in the same room.

14:40.949 --> 14:42.284
And sometimes it feels like

14:42.326 --> 14:43.846
it's not the face blindness,
you know?

14:43.869 --> 14:45.829
It's the same
with me and Lindsay.

14:45.871 --> 14:48.207
I know she's trying,
but she doesn't believe

14:48.248 --> 14:50.209
in my acting career.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.961
Maybe she's right. I've yet
to make more money as an actor

14:53.003 --> 14:55.005
than I ever did as a doctor.

14:55.047 --> 14:56.840
And that's with
Country-Wide behind me.

14:56.882 --> 14:59.051
You're... wait, you're a doctor?
You can write scripts?

14:59.092 --> 15:01.011
Well, I like to think so.

15:01.053 --> 15:04.390
You should never give up a dream
if you can write scripts.

15:04.431 --> 15:07.393
You seem like you'd be
a good doctor/actor.

15:07.434 --> 15:09.728
It was the first
positive reinforcement

15:09.769 --> 15:11.855
Tobias had had since India.

15:11.897 --> 15:15.484
You remind me of
Billy Crystal... Mmm, mmm!

15:15.526 --> 15:18.195
It would have broken
Tobias's heart if he knew

15:18.237 --> 15:20.364
she was about to say
"Billy Crystal Meth,"

15:20.406 --> 15:21.823
a funny drug dealer.

15:21.865 --> 15:25.369
Uh, I... got a bit carried away

15:25.411 --> 15:27.663
when you compared me
to Billy Crystal.

15:27.705 --> 15:30.207
You remind me
of Billy Crystal...

15:30.249 --> 15:33.793
Once again, she was going
to say "Billy Crystal Meth."

15:33.835 --> 15:36.547
I'm sorry, but, DeBrie,
I-I've never met anyone

15:36.589 --> 15:38.424
who understands me like you do.

15:38.465 --> 15:40.634
- Or at all.
- Maybe, with someone like you,

15:40.676 --> 15:42.302
I could have a new start.

15:42.344 --> 15:45.764
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:45.805 --> 15:49.476
Did you see my license plate--
"A-N-U-S-T-A-R-T"?

15:49.518 --> 15:52.062
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:52.104 --> 15:55.815
Did you see my Straight Bait
movie of the same name?

15:55.857 --> 15:58.193
(singsong):
Coincidence.

15:58.235 --> 15:59.737
We should be together.

15:59.778 --> 16:01.154
We should run away.

16:01.196 --> 16:02.573
(stammering)

16:02.615 --> 16:03.865
Oh, my gosh.

16:03.907 --> 16:05.534
Well, this is happening so fast.

16:05.576 --> 16:07.119
Well, what do I do
about Lindsay?

16:07.160 --> 16:09.913
I mean, can I just improv my way
out of a marriage?

16:10.956 --> 16:14.501
Yes, and... let's do this.

16:14.543 --> 16:15.586
Blackout.

16:15.628 --> 16:17.254
Unaware that a similar

16:17.296 --> 16:19.798
off-menu swap had just occurred
at Swappigans,

16:19.839 --> 16:21.383
Tobias broke the news

16:21.425 --> 16:23.761
that he was leaving Lindsay
in a phone call.

16:23.802 --> 16:25.262
...for I have met someone.

16:25.304 --> 16:26.888
It's not important who it is.

16:26.930 --> 16:28.474
(laughs):
It's Sue Storm.

16:28.515 --> 16:30.643
I'm so sorry,
but DeBrie believes in me,

16:30.684 --> 16:32.603
and she stopped my heart, too.

16:32.645 --> 16:35.689
If you're wondering what "too"
referred to, it was this:

16:35.731 --> 16:37.023
Let's do this.

16:37.065 --> 16:38.525
Blackout.

16:38.567 --> 16:40.736
And scene, as they say.

16:40.778 --> 16:42.139
Her heart stopped!
She-She's dying!

16:42.154 --> 16:44.615
Please, someone!
She had too much butter!

16:44.657 --> 16:46.116
- She's a very famous actress!
- Someone say "butter" out here?

16:46.158 --> 16:47.867
Oh, my God,
that's a butter face.

16:47.909 --> 16:50.162
- How much butter did the patient have?
- I don't know.

16:50.203 --> 16:51.997
- A Star Trek chess set's worth.
- Damn it, that Swappigans

16:52.038 --> 16:54.458
puts more people in
this hospital. Make way, people!

16:54.500 --> 16:55.709
We got a 61-year-old male

16:55.751 --> 16:57.169
in full cardiac arrest
coming through.

16:57.210 --> 16:58.420
You have to wait outside, sir.

16:58.462 --> 16:59.713
Be careful of her face!

16:59.755 --> 17:01.507
She's an actress!

17:01.548 --> 17:03.258
(loud sobbing)

17:03.300 --> 17:04.843
It's worth noting that Tobias

17:04.884 --> 17:07.179
had heard this hospital
in Orange County

17:07.220 --> 17:09.765
was a favorite
of show business big shots

17:09.807 --> 17:11.266
seeking plastic surgery.

17:11.308 --> 17:13.393
We're both actors!

17:13.435 --> 17:15.479
(loud, exaggerated sobbing)

17:18.565 --> 17:20.526
NARRATOR:
On the day of Lucille's trial,

17:20.567 --> 17:22.819
Tobias was in a hospital
with a woman

17:22.861 --> 17:25.531
he'd both fallen for
and had rushed into an ICU.

17:25.571 --> 17:28.282
See? Makeup makes everyone
feel a little better.

17:28.325 --> 17:29.785
You didn't leave me.

17:29.827 --> 17:31.704
Everybody leaves me.

17:31.745 --> 17:35.499
I've been left in Dumpsters
and on a curb and...

17:35.541 --> 17:37.042
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.461
Excuse me. Could you, uh,
leave us alone for...

17:39.503 --> 17:41.213
- Yeah, absolutely, yes.
- Thank you.

17:41.254 --> 17:43.507
Oh, no, I-I'd like him
to-to stay.

17:43.549 --> 17:44.591
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:44.633 --> 17:45.592
Okay.

17:45.634 --> 17:46.885
I'm afraid that you have

17:46.926 --> 17:48.804
tested positive
for chlamydia, syphilis,

17:48.846 --> 17:50.263
gonorrhea, hepatitis,
pancreatitis,

17:50.305 --> 17:53.600
trichomonitis,
nongonococcal urethritis.

17:53.642 --> 17:56.562
All the itises, really,
and there's also

17:56.603 --> 17:57.813
a host of osises.

17:57.855 --> 17:59.565
Now, what this means
in nonmedical terms

17:59.606 --> 18:02.526
is that you have landed, uh,
a real party girl.

18:02.568 --> 18:04.444
TOBIAS:
Well, will she be okay?

18:04.486 --> 18:06.154
Well, we can treat
all of these things,

18:06.196 --> 18:07.823
but if she's really
gonna be okay,

18:07.865 --> 18:09.825
uh, she's gonna have to tackle
this drug problem.

18:09.867 --> 18:12.077
You didn't tell me
you had a drug problem.

18:12.118 --> 18:14.287
We met at a methadone clinic.

18:14.329 --> 18:15.288
Are you high?

18:15.330 --> 18:16.749
We met at an acting class.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.500
The Method One...

18:18.542 --> 18:21.211
There it is. I'm gonna let
you guys, uh, hash this out.

18:21.253 --> 18:23.296
I guess I shouldn't have
lied about being clean

18:23.338 --> 18:26.550
when I took that methadone,
but I'll do better this time.

18:26.592 --> 18:27.885
Or are you gonna leave me

18:27.926 --> 18:30.095
now that you know
that I'm a druggie?

18:30.136 --> 18:33.432
DeBrie, look, some people
struggle with addiction,

18:33.473 --> 18:36.059
other people are incapable
of ever being nude.

18:36.101 --> 18:37.603
Everybody has something.

18:37.644 --> 18:40.647
And it's my professional opinion
that your drug use

18:40.689 --> 18:44.610
is a direct result of your
abandoning your dream of acting.

18:44.651 --> 18:46.403
You are a gifted actress.

18:46.445 --> 18:48.405
When I first saw Straight Bait,

18:48.447 --> 18:49.740
there were two men making love,

18:49.782 --> 18:51.784
but I couldn't take
my eyes off of you.

18:51.825 --> 18:53.535
You watched Straight Bait?

18:53.577 --> 18:55.078
Oh, just2, 4and9.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.497
You were with a guy
who didn't care about you.

18:57.539 --> 19:00.751
But stick with me,
and I'll make you famous.

19:00.793 --> 19:04.504
By cashing in
on your most celebrated role.

19:04.546 --> 19:05.672
Come one, come all!

19:05.714 --> 19:08.133
Get your photo taken
with Sue Storm

19:08.174 --> 19:09.635
from the Fantastic Four!

19:09.676 --> 19:11.261
Hey, is that Jessica Alba?

19:11.303 --> 19:14.180
No, this is the original
Sue Storm, DeBrie Bardeaux!

19:14.222 --> 19:16.099
- Who?
- The original Sue Storm,

19:16.141 --> 19:17.726
DeBrie Bardeaux. She--
No, no!

19:17.768 --> 19:18.727
No free pictures, kids!

19:18.769 --> 19:19.728
No, no, scram!

19:19.770 --> 19:20.771
Get out of here! Go!

19:20.813 --> 19:22.105
Go, get out of here.

19:22.147 --> 19:23.649
I don't think this is working.

19:23.690 --> 19:26.025
Maybe I need to get
a regular job.

19:26.067 --> 19:28.194
I do have a law degree.

19:28.236 --> 19:30.071
I know, I know,
and I'm a doctor.

19:30.113 --> 19:32.031
But no, let's not settle.

19:32.073 --> 19:34.033
Look, it's the Fantastic Four.

19:34.075 --> 19:36.578
No one recognizes one alone.

19:36.620 --> 19:37.955
I've got an idea.

19:37.996 --> 19:40.081
Ten dollars gets you
a picture with

19:40.123 --> 19:41.333
real Hollywood characters!

19:41.374 --> 19:42.542
What do you say? Ten dollars.

19:42.584 --> 19:43.543
That's certainly cheap.

19:43.585 --> 19:45.796
Oh! Hello, young man,

19:45.838 --> 19:48.089
and his... uncle? Neighbor?

19:48.131 --> 19:49.382
Father.

19:49.424 --> 19:50.676
Oh! That's terrific.

19:50.717 --> 19:52.093
(laughs)
Well, how would you like

19:52.135 --> 19:53.470
to have your picture taken

19:53.512 --> 19:56.348
with real Hollywood
movie land characters?

19:56.389 --> 19:57.766
Are you the Smurfs?

19:57.808 --> 19:59.351
No, no, no.

19:59.392 --> 20:00.936
They're the Ambiguously Gay Duo.

20:00.978 --> 20:02.270
Oh, I assure you,

20:02.312 --> 20:04.105
there's nothing ambiguous
about me.

20:04.147 --> 20:06.399
I'm Johnny Storm,
the human flamer.

20:06.441 --> 20:10.236
And this is Sue Storm, my sister
and fellow fighter-in-law.

20:10.278 --> 20:12.405
Now watch as I get--
no, I have special effects!

20:12.447 --> 20:14.282
Look, children love fire.

20:14.324 --> 20:15.325
Oh.

20:15.367 --> 20:16.326
This isn't working either.

20:16.368 --> 20:17.995
(sighs)
You're right.

20:18.036 --> 20:20.455
Two people in blue
doesn't say Fantastic Four.

20:20.497 --> 20:22.165
You know what though?

20:22.207 --> 20:24.250
I think I may have
just the thing.

20:24.292 --> 20:25.460
Oh?

20:25.502 --> 20:27.546
Just "the thing."

20:27.587 --> 20:29.006
Cut to...

20:29.047 --> 20:31.591
Now that I'm the iconic
rock man The Thing,

20:31.633 --> 20:33.218
no one will misunderstand.

20:33.259 --> 20:35.971
I'm sure the Blues Brothers here
will know who we are.

20:36.013 --> 20:37.848
Excuse me, are you Sue Storm
and The Thing?

20:37.890 --> 20:39.683
Oh, who's smart now?

20:39.725 --> 20:41.393
Indeed we are.

20:41.434 --> 20:43.520
In fact, they were orthodox
members of the law firm

20:43.562 --> 20:46.231
Feinberg, Feinberg, Feinberg
& Feinberg.

20:46.272 --> 20:48.984
We represent Stan Lee
and Marvel Enterprises.

20:49.026 --> 20:50.652
This is a cease and desist

20:50.694 --> 20:52.445
ordering you
to stop impersonating

20:52.487 --> 20:54.113
any of our trademark characters.

20:54.155 --> 20:55.615
Oh, let me take a look at that.

20:55.657 --> 20:56.700
I have a law degree.

20:56.742 --> 20:57.910
No, DeBrie, I've got this.

20:57.951 --> 21:00.119
Mr. Feinberg?

21:00.161 --> 21:01.788
Uh, would it change your mind

21:01.830 --> 21:05.876
if I offered you
a free Sue Storm armband?

21:05.918 --> 21:07.794
It did not change his mind.

21:07.836 --> 21:10.547
And although the hate crime
charges were dismissed,

21:10.589 --> 21:12.298
they were told
they could not continue

21:12.340 --> 21:13.800
to pose as the Fantastic Four.

21:13.842 --> 21:16.553
Can they really make us leave
Hollywood Boulevard?

21:16.595 --> 21:19.681
Well, apparently in
this instance, paper beats rock.

21:19.723 --> 21:20.682
You have a rock?

21:20.724 --> 21:23.018
No, I am your rock now.

21:23.060 --> 21:24.061
Oh.

21:24.102 --> 21:25.228
So what are we gonna do

21:25.270 --> 21:26.939
now that we don't
have the rights?

21:26.980 --> 21:28.732
Well, we just go off-brand.

21:28.774 --> 21:32.318
Uh, we'll just change the names
and do a cheap generic knockoff.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.112
Kids don't care.

21:34.153 --> 21:35.864
Tobias took them down
to a street

21:35.906 --> 21:38.575
near Harbor Boulevard,
where his friend Gary Goose

21:38.617 --> 21:40.159
told him
they didn't police very much.

21:40.201 --> 21:42.081
Rock Monster and Ability
to Be Invisible Person.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.705
Hello, young man.
What brings you

21:43.747 --> 21:46.666
to at least 500 feet
past the entrance of Disneyland?

21:46.708 --> 21:47.834
Dad, can I get my picture taken

21:47.876 --> 21:49.002
with The Thing
and Invisible Girl?

21:49.044 --> 21:50.545
They're the Fantastic Four.

21:50.587 --> 21:52.547
Well, actually, technically,
I'm Rock Monster,

21:52.589 --> 21:54.883
and this is
Ability to Be Invisible Person.

21:54.925 --> 21:56.802
- Hey, you guys want the ten dollars or not?
- Yeah.

21:56.843 --> 21:58.344
- Uh...
- Yeah, yeah.

21:58.386 --> 22:00.055
Yes. Okay.

22:00.097 --> 22:02.641
We're The Thing
and the Invisible Girl.

22:02.682 --> 22:03.767
- You're under arrest.
- What?

22:03.809 --> 22:05.310
Boom. Turn around.

22:05.351 --> 22:06.686
- Let's go.
- I didn't...

22:06.728 --> 22:08.105
- Let's go. Get up there.
- Oh! Oh!

22:08.146 --> 22:09.898
Come on.

22:09.940 --> 22:11.900
- Oh, come on, now.
- (chuckles): No, no, no.

22:11.942 --> 22:14.319
We're not gonna kill him,
we're just gonna handcuff him.

22:14.360 --> 22:15.946
You can't shoot us
'cause it's not a felony.

22:15.988 --> 22:18.073
Keep your eyes on her.
I'll be right back.

22:18.115 --> 22:20.075
Okay.

22:22.494 --> 22:23.787
DeBRIE:
If it happens again,

22:23.829 --> 22:25.914
you know, it will be
a third strike.

22:25.956 --> 22:27.624
Three-strikes law's up for
review in the appellate courts,

22:27.666 --> 22:28.959
but we really
shouldn't be charging.

22:29.001 --> 22:30.710
I know of a street
in Garden Grove

22:30.752 --> 22:32.712
- where they don't police very much.
- Okay.

22:32.754 --> 22:34.255
NARRATOR:
Things were looking down.

22:34.297 --> 22:36.925
And over the following weeks,

22:36.967 --> 22:38.760
their financial situation
grew dire enough

22:38.802 --> 22:40.053
for this to happen.

22:40.095 --> 22:41.972
We're broke.

22:42.014 --> 22:43.932
But you can't sell
your Fantastic Four costume.

22:43.974 --> 22:45.308
I mean, that would be
like a fisherman

22:45.350 --> 22:47.352
selling his fishing costume.

22:47.393 --> 22:49.604
No, I was gonna
have sex with him.

22:49.646 --> 22:51.188
For money.

22:51.230 --> 22:52.899
What? No. Put that back on.

22:52.941 --> 22:54.901
You don't have to
degrade yourself this way.

22:54.943 --> 22:57.070
Hey, I'm not a thing.

22:57.112 --> 22:59.322
Hey, I am a Thing.

22:59.364 --> 23:01.908
And so, with no other options,
Tobias returned

23:01.950 --> 23:03.409
to his in-laws' penthouse,

23:03.451 --> 23:06.371
desperate enough
to ransack the place,

23:06.412 --> 23:09.332
when it appeared
someone had beaten him to it.

23:09.374 --> 23:11.168
Michael.

23:11.208 --> 23:12.878
No, George Michael.

23:12.919 --> 23:14.796
LUCILLE 2:
Somebody, help!

23:14.838 --> 23:16.715
And that's when he heard
what sounded like two ostriches

23:16.756 --> 23:18.842
making love to a pop hit.

23:18.884 --> 23:20.552
But was actually this.

23:20.593 --> 23:24.097
♪ Why don't you
go away, go away ♪

23:24.139 --> 23:25.640
♪ Get away, get away ♪

23:25.682 --> 23:27.600
♪ Stay away ♪

23:27.642 --> 23:30.187
♪ You're hopelessly
hopeless... ♪

23:30.227 --> 23:32.605
(screams)
Good bird.

23:32.647 --> 23:34.191
- (screams)
- (ostrich squawking)

23:34.231 --> 23:35.650
Stop it, chicken!

23:35.692 --> 23:37.861
Somebody help!

23:37.903 --> 23:39.071
Lucille 2!

23:39.112 --> 23:40.906
Help! Help!
Kevin, give me a hand!

23:40.947 --> 23:42.448
Get Dr. Bowman or Alicia.

23:42.490 --> 23:43.825
Either one.

23:43.867 --> 23:45.994
This woman's been
attacked by an ostrich!

23:46.036 --> 23:47.954
Ah, Tobias got a new girlfriend.

23:47.996 --> 23:49.246
(laughs)

23:52.792 --> 23:54.460
NARRATOR: Tobias had acted like
an actual superhero

23:54.502 --> 23:55.587
- and saved Lucille 2.
- There's my hero.

23:55.628 --> 23:57.089
You know, the doctor said

23:57.130 --> 23:58.381
if that bird had gotten through

23:58.423 --> 24:00.341
my second layer of makeup,
it could've done

24:00.383 --> 24:01.593
permanent damage to my skin.

24:01.634 --> 24:03.344
And I want to repay you.

24:03.386 --> 24:06.014
You're a doctor,
and you're out of work.

24:06.056 --> 24:07.933
- Well...
- How would you like to come work for me,

24:07.974 --> 24:09.392
at Austerity?

24:09.434 --> 24:11.436
The rehab center? That's yours?

24:11.477 --> 24:13.479
Well, my brother Argyle
runs it day to day.

24:13.521 --> 24:14.689
But we are so understaffed.

24:14.731 --> 24:16.191
You'd be such a gift.

24:16.233 --> 24:19.276
It would only pay
120 grand a year to start.

24:19.318 --> 24:21.529
Tobias, whose girlfriend
had nearly

24:21.571 --> 24:23.949
sold her body for money
in front of him,

24:23.990 --> 24:27.202
knew that everyone at some time
has to face reality.

24:27.244 --> 24:29.328
(sustained groaning)

24:31.372 --> 24:33.374
- But that this wasn't the time.
- No.

24:33.416 --> 24:35.127
- You turned it down?!
- Uh-huh.

24:35.168 --> 24:38.004
I almost (bleep) a guy
for a hamburger,

24:38.046 --> 24:40.924
and you turned down
$120, 000 a year?

24:40.966 --> 24:43.384
To keep our dream alive,
yes, I did.

24:43.426 --> 24:45.137
I thought you'd be proud of me.

24:45.178 --> 24:47.055
After all, a doctor in India

24:47.097 --> 24:49.641
told me that I have the gift
to make people laugh.

24:49.682 --> 24:51.308
- (sobbing)
- Why are you crying?

24:51.350 --> 24:53.394
(sobbing):
You're worse than Marky.

24:53.436 --> 24:57.398
He couldn't see me,
but you can't hear me.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.400
(sobbing)

24:59.442 --> 25:01.903
The setback sent
an emotionally fragile DeBrie

25:01.945 --> 25:04.614
back to her old ways.

25:04.656 --> 25:07.200
And before long,
she was picked up by a limo

25:07.242 --> 25:08.952
for a night of
being passed around

25:08.994 --> 25:11.412
amongst Hollywood creeps.

25:11.454 --> 25:15.458
For three weeks, Tobias waited,
hoping DeBrie would return.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.670
Perhaps it was
the morning he awoke to find

25:18.711 --> 25:20.255
two bums using him as a pillow

25:20.297 --> 25:22.465
that he realized
she wasn't coming back.

25:22.507 --> 25:24.050
Who are you supposed to be?

25:24.092 --> 25:26.552
Oh, I'm The Thing
from Fantastic Four.

25:26.594 --> 25:29.555
You've been served, (bleep).

25:29.597 --> 25:32.142
Oh, (bleep) me.

25:32.184 --> 25:33.977
Are you undercover as well?

25:34.019 --> 25:35.937
I'm CIA.
Not here for you though.

25:35.979 --> 25:38.315
Scoping out
Imagine Entertainment.

25:38.355 --> 25:40.733
So, with nowhere to go...

25:40.775 --> 25:42.443
Thought I'd try you again.

25:42.485 --> 25:44.154
...and no one to help him
out of his rock suit...

25:44.196 --> 25:46.281
Honey, you read
comic books, yes?

25:46.323 --> 25:47.824
...he went to see
if his daughter

25:47.866 --> 25:50.327
would give him a place to stay.

25:50.367 --> 25:52.495
(indistinct radio transmission)

25:52.537 --> 25:54.873
(singing quietly)

25:54.914 --> 25:57.667
Now the fun begins,
right, Officer Three?

25:57.709 --> 25:59.544
I'll say.

25:59.585 --> 26:02.130
...and why and how. Who, what,
when, where, why and how.

26:03.548 --> 26:06.301
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

26:06.343 --> 26:08.636
And perhaps it was this
that would finally

26:08.678 --> 26:11.223
get him to admit
that he sometimes did speak

26:11.264 --> 26:12.932
in a misleading way.

26:12.974 --> 26:15.768
Daddy needs to get
his rocks off.

26:20.690 --> 26:23.235
BEARD: On the next
To Entrap a Local Predator...

26:23.276 --> 26:25.237
(high-pitched):
I'll be down in a minute.

26:25.278 --> 26:27.030
Have some lemonade.

26:27.072 --> 26:28.823
TV NARRATOR: Predator gets
its first rock-solid case.

26:28.865 --> 26:31.534
(normal voice):
Pretty good lemonade, huh?

26:31.576 --> 26:32.827
It is.

26:32.869 --> 26:34.537
Is there alcohol in here--
John Beard!

26:34.579 --> 26:35.538
Please, have a seat.

26:35.580 --> 26:36.539
Okay.

26:36.581 --> 26:37.707
Why are you here?

26:37.749 --> 26:39.125
I'm here to see my little girl.

26:39.167 --> 26:41.378
I wanted to show her
Daddy's Thing.

26:41.418 --> 26:42.712
What are you doing here?

26:42.754 --> 26:45.506
I'm doing a, um,
a local interest piece.

26:45.548 --> 26:46.507
Mm.

26:46.549 --> 26:47.592
Okay, get in there, boys.

26:47.633 --> 26:49.302
Oh, really local.

26:49.344 --> 26:50.345
That's right, yeah.

26:50.387 --> 26:51.428
Is this about my daughter?

26:51.470 --> 26:52.597
Oh, so it's your daughter

26:52.638 --> 26:54.307
- you're here to see?
- Yes.

26:55.058 --> 26:56.433
Maeby.

26:56.475 --> 26:58.311
If he's got a daughter,
then how old is she?

26:58.353 --> 26:59.436
BEARD:
Let me ask you this.

26:59.478 --> 27:00.437
How old is she?

27:00.479 --> 27:02.481
(chuckles):
Oh.

27:02.523 --> 27:04.359
Why do you put me on the spot?

27:04.401 --> 27:07.279
Um, I want to say 19?

27:07.320 --> 27:09.864
But I like
to think of her as 15.

27:09.906 --> 27:10.907
Well, you're free to go.

27:10.949 --> 27:12.533
She's not here.

27:12.575 --> 27:14.255
TV NARRATOR:
But this creep won't take "go"

27:14.286 --> 27:15.703
- for an answer.
- Oh, that's all right.

27:15.745 --> 27:17.289
I'll stay, I'll wait.

27:17.330 --> 27:19.291
And this creep makes himself
right at home.

27:19.332 --> 27:21.293
- Give me just a minute.
- He's not leaving.

27:21.334 --> 27:23.253
- He's not leaving.
- He's not leaving.

27:23.295 --> 27:25.171
Tell him there's a raccoon
in the backyard.

27:25.213 --> 27:26.756
Hey, guess what.

27:26.798 --> 27:28.549
There's a raccoon
out on the patio!

27:28.591 --> 27:29.617
Bull (bleep).

27:29.737 --> 27:30.907
Where is that little guy?

27:31.027 --> 27:33.805
And this guy turns out to be
a real comedian.

27:33.846 --> 27:34.635
(groans loudly)

27:34.755 --> 27:36.530
I just broke my skull
in a fourth place:

27:36.650 --> 27:38.134
the patio!

27:38.254 --> 27:41.179
