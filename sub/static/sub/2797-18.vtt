(Howard) Cunningham,
you have to let this go.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.375
It's going to drive you mad.

00:20.458 --> 00:22.250
-I am mad!
-And I would be, too,

00:22.333 --> 00:25.542
-if somebody ate my lunch.
-You ate my lunch!

00:25.625 --> 00:27.792
Look,
we don't know what happened for sure.

00:27.875 --> 00:30.333
When you went to the bathroom,
there was a sandwich.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.834
When you came back, the sandwich was gone.

00:32.917 --> 00:34.667
It's a mystery.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.166
-What's on the side of your mouth?
-Mm. Nothin'.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.667

00:38.750 --> 00:39.959
Attention students!

00:40.041 --> 00:41.625
This is not over.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.792
As you know, this week at NHS is

00:43.875 --> 00:46.166
"Get Off Your Butts
And Do Something" week!

00:46.250 --> 00:47.667
Which is why for the next hour,

00:47.750 --> 00:50.333
you're going to sit right there

00:50.417 --> 00:53.250

00:53.333 --> 00:55.834
Mac Antfee! Yay!

00:55.917 --> 00:57.333
-Mac Antfee?
-(gasping)

00:57.417 --> 00:59.500
-Who's Mac Antfee?
-Seriously?

00:59.583 --> 01:02.375
Seriously, that psychotic
former ninja who ran Ninja Camp?

01:02.458 --> 01:03.792
The one who tried to kill you?

01:05.250 --> 01:07.000
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.

01:07.083 --> 01:11.291
Get ready to taste the 'Splosion!

01:11.375 --> 01:14.333
(grunting)

01:14.417 --> 01:15.792
That Mac Antfee.

01:15.875 --> 01:19.166
Yeah, I remember him. He's a jerk.

01:20.083 --> 01:22.041
Howard, save my seat.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.709
Not like you saved my sandwich.

01:24.792 --> 01:26.166
(yelling, grunts)

01:26.250 --> 01:28.709
Someday I'll come
back for that ninja suit,

01:28.792 --> 01:32.291
and when I get it,
I'll kick every butt in Norrisville!

01:36.000 --> 01:38.667
The last thing a Ninja's

01:38.750 --> 01:40.208
Mac never mind-wiped!

01:41.208 --> 01:42.250
(gasps)

01:42.333 --> 01:43.792
Only way to stop Mac for good

01:43.875 --> 01:45.542
is to make him forget he was the Ninja.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.458
I'm gonna wipe his butt!

01:47.542 --> 01:49.792
Mind-wipe his butt... is what I meant.

01:49.875 --> 01:51.917

02:01.750 --> 02:04.041
What the juice is going on?

02:04.125 --> 02:05.834
I'm going to get real with you people.

02:05.917 --> 02:09.333
I used to be what you
might call a "major league shoob."

02:09.375 --> 02:13.917
Then I lost it all: my Ninja Camp,
my awesome bus.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.917
All I had left was my go-fast boat
and my bro, Man Gong.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.166

-(crying)

02:20.250 --> 02:23.041
Hey, I'm unexpectedly moved by this.

02:23.125 --> 02:28.917
That's when I realized, all I had
to do was 'splode to a better me!

02:29.000 --> 02:30.875
And you can, too!

02:30.959 --> 02:32.875

02:44.166 --> 02:46.500
anyone can!

Prepare to harness

02:56.709 --> 02:58.625
Mac Antfee is a good guy?

02:58.709 --> 03:00.709
Oh, he is not a good guy,

03:00.792 --> 03:01.875
he's a great guy!

03:03.625 --> 03:06.000

03:06.083 --> 03:08.250
Feel the You-Splosion!

03:08.333 --> 03:12.000

03:12.083 --> 03:14.083

-Hey!
-(sobbing)

03:15.375 --> 03:18.500
(sobs) We're best friends forever now.

03:18.583 --> 03:21.834
This is all a cover so Mac
can come after the Ninja! I know it!

03:21.917 --> 03:23.625
Cunningham, please let this go.

03:23.709 --> 03:26.166
You are seriously

03:29.500 --> 03:31.333
Well, well, well.

03:31.417 --> 03:34.125
If it isn't the nicewad
and my old Mac-olyte.

03:38.125 --> 03:40.208
Get over here, you two!

03:40.291 --> 03:42.667
(chuckling) You're awesome, Mac.

03:42.750 --> 03:43.959
-No...
-(gasps)

03:44.041 --> 03:45.834
We're awesome.

03:45.917 --> 03:47.709
-(both laughing)
-Mac, quick question.

03:47.792 --> 03:51.542
Last time, you wanted to steal the Ninja's
mask and kick every butt in Norrisville.

03:51.625 --> 03:54.041
-That still on the menu?
-Kick every butt?

03:54.125 --> 03:57.041
More like inspire every butt.

03:57.125 --> 03:59.291
There, see? Let it go.

03:59.375 --> 04:01.250
So, you don't want the power of the suit

04:01.333 --> 04:04.291
and the pure Ninja
awesomeness that goes with it?

04:04.375 --> 04:07.667
-No, I'm good.
-Admit it, Mac.

04:07.750 --> 04:10.417
You wanna feel those magic
black jimmy-jams swirling around you,

04:10.500 --> 04:12.875
giving you skills you
could only dream of. I can feel it.

04:12.959 --> 04:15.375
You want the weapons,
and the Nomicon, and the smoke bombs.

04:15.458 --> 04:18.041
Come on, how fun are the smoke bombs?

04:18.125 --> 04:20.333
(whimpering) Hey...

04:20.417 --> 04:23.041
You sure know an awful lot
about being the Ninja!

04:23.125 --> 04:25.250
Of course,
this is all speculation on my part.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.750
How would I know? I'm just a freshman.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.792
Ordinary, average freshman.
I'm gonna go. Goodbye.

04:29.875 --> 04:32.333
But I didn't get my You-Splosion.

04:32.417 --> 04:34.583
You just couldn't let it go.

04:34.667 --> 04:37.291
You pretty much told
Mac Antfee that you're the Ninja.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.417
(Randy chuckles) I think it's gonna be OK.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.000
Mac doesn't care about that stuff anymore.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.959
He said it. You heard him.
This is all gonna be fine.

04:44.041 --> 04:45.500
Tell me this is going to be fine.

04:45.583 --> 04:47.875
Then why are you hiding in your locker?

I will never stop coming after you.

So save yourself a lot of trouble,

05:16.166 --> 05:18.041
Oh, nice work, Cunningham.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.000
Mac Antfee was a full on nicewad,

05:20.083 --> 05:22.792
until you un-sploded
him back into a jerkwad.

05:22.875 --> 05:26.375
I'm totally shoobed! He'll keep
coming after me and everyone I know!

05:26.458 --> 05:28.500
Sometimes I wish
I wasn't everyone you know.

05:28.583 --> 05:31.667
I have to Mind Wipe Mac Antfee.
Howard, I need your help.

05:31.750 --> 05:35.083
Oh, no. Mac'll recognize me
the second I walk in the room.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.959
-Or, will he?
-Yes. He will.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.500
-(grunting)
-What're you doin', Mr. Antfee?

05:42.583 --> 05:44.709
Punching melons, little...

05:44.792 --> 05:47.083

-...lady, is it?

05:47.166 --> 05:49.542
Oh, yes. I'm a girl, all right.

05:49.625 --> 05:51.000

05:51.083 --> 05:52.375
Can I get your autograph?

05:52.458 --> 05:53.959
Don't I know you?

05:54.041 --> 05:55.917
Not unless you enjoy such activities as

05:56.000 --> 05:58.917
sewing, painting your nails
and driving a race car,

05:59.000 --> 06:01.834
which are just a few of the things
girls can do these days.

06:01.917 --> 06:03.083
(giggling) Sky's the limit!

06:03.166 --> 06:05.458
Kind of busy getting
pumped for a smack down!

06:05.542 --> 06:07.000
Then how 'bout you sign my math book

06:07.083 --> 06:09.417
and I'll skadoodle on out of here!

Gonna tell me why you shloomped
me in here, ya scaredy-baby?

06:32.834 --> 06:35.000
(Randy) To end things, once and for all.

06:35.083 --> 06:38.291
You know, I didn't even go
to Norrisville High looking for the Ninja.

06:38.375 --> 06:41.709
But the stupid Ninja came to me! Ha!

06:41.792 --> 06:43.750
(Randy) Yeah,
not one of my better moments.

06:43.834 --> 06:46.834
-But I'm gonna fix it.

Doodle Sword? How'd you do that?

07:09.959 --> 07:12.208
We're in the Nomicon, chucklehead.

07:12.291 --> 07:16.583
In here, anything is possible. (laughing)

07:16.667 --> 07:18.417
Oh boy. Not good.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.250
(panting) I knew I should've worn flats!

07:22.417 --> 07:23.917
Oh boy.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.375

07:29.583 --> 07:31.625
-(panting)
-Just give up!

07:31.709 --> 07:34.458
We'll vloomp out, I'll take the mask,

07:34.542 --> 07:36.125
you walk the earth in shame!
Sound good?

07:37.792 --> 07:40.625
(gasps) I got a better idea.

07:40.709 --> 07:43.375
-Tengu Fire Ball!
-Ninja Hydro Hand!

07:44.709 --> 07:47.542
There's a Hydro Hand?
What the juice, Nomicon!

07:47.625 --> 07:49.667
I was the Ninja for five years!

07:49.750 --> 07:52.583
-Five years?
-All right, six years.

07:52.667 --> 07:56.500
Point is,
I got skills you ain't even heard of yet!!

07:57.875 --> 08:01.166

-Yes!
-(growling)

08:12.041 --> 08:15.458
Cunningham! Hurry it up in there!

08:19.375 --> 08:21.542
Look at me! Four arms...

08:21.625 --> 08:23.041
I've missed this.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.875
(grunts)

08:24.959 --> 08:26.792

08:26.875 --> 08:28.625
Didn't know I had a tail, did you?

08:28.709 --> 08:31.375
Neither did I! I just did that.

08:31.458 --> 08:33.417
(yelling)

08:33.500 --> 08:35.458
Nomicon,
I don't want to be a jerk about this,

08:35.542 --> 08:38.375
but if Mac had been properly
Mind Wiped when you de-masked him,

08:38.458 --> 08:40.041
none of this would be happening!

08:40.125 --> 08:42.250
(yelling)

08:49.125 --> 08:54.792

08:56.875 --> 08:58.125

<i>anything is possible.</i>

09:04.875 --> 09:06.291
Ha!

09:07.333 --> 09:08.250
Ho! Ho!

09:10.333 --> 09:13.959
Oh! You brought me
in here to Mind Wipe me?

09:14.041 --> 09:16.125
That is adorable.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.750
Mac, when you're done being the Ninja,

09:17.834 --> 09:19.291
you're supposed to Mind Wipe yourself.

09:19.375 --> 09:22.083
Why would I want to forget
how awesome I am?

09:22.166 --> 09:25.375
But the memory of having all
this Bruce power can drive you crazy!

09:25.458 --> 09:27.542
Which is why you're crazy!

09:27.625 --> 09:28.792
Uh-huh, I hear you.

09:28.875 --> 09:32.291
Or, how about this, I Mind Wipe you!

09:32.375 --> 09:34.041
-Ah!
-(laughing)

09:34.125 --> 09:35.291
You don't want to do that.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.083
Oh, I so want to do it.

09:38.166 --> 09:41.542
Listen, there's no shame
in losing to the Class of '85,

09:41.625 --> 09:44.875
-because we rule!
-Please don't do this.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.000
Don't worry. You won't even remember

09:47.083 --> 09:48.375
-I kicked your butt!
-(Randy) No!

09:48.458 --> 09:51.041
Now time to vloomp out of here
and get my mask back.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.834
(humming, gasps)

09:54.917 --> 09:56.583
What the juice?

09:58.917 --> 10:00.125
You tricked me!

10:00.208 --> 10:03.250
Ain't no shame in losing

10:03.834 --> 10:05.542
No!

10:09.166 --> 10:10.959
(panting) Seriously...

10:11.041 --> 10:12.959
When are you...

10:13.041 --> 10:14.917
...gonna give up?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.083
-(grunts)
-(growls)

10:16.166 --> 10:19.125
Man Gong! What are you doing?

10:19.208 --> 10:21.834
-Oh! (giggles)
-Help me tear the stage down.

10:21.917 --> 10:25.750
We gotta get to Flackville for a 4:30
You-Splosion and River Cruise!

10:25.834 --> 10:27.667
(grunts)

10:28.417 --> 10:29.709
Here's your stupid book.

10:29.792 --> 10:31.041
(whispering)

10:31.125 --> 10:32.917
Me? The Ninja?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.083
I think I'd remember something like that.

10:36.166 --> 10:39.000
We did it, Howard.
We Mind Wiped Mac Antfee.

10:39.083 --> 10:40.834
You know what we could do, MG?

10:40.917 --> 10:44.041
Make a fruit salad.
Drop it by the orphanage on the way!

10:44.125 --> 10:46.333
Yep, he's a permanent nicewad.

10:46.417 --> 10:48.583
Let's go to the Bucket. I'm starved.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.709
Hey buddy, my treat.

10:50.792 --> 10:53.542
You took that from my wallet
while I was shloomped out, didn't you?

10:53.625 --> 10:56.834
Let it go, Cunningham. Let it go.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.041
(humming)

11:01.792 --> 11:04.625
(Principal on PA) <i>So the music class</i>
<i>is cancelled until further notice.</i>

11:04.709 --> 11:08.291
<i>In lieu of flowers,</i>
<i>the family asks that you send... a note!</i>

11:08.375 --> 11:10.083
School announcement, zing!

11:10.166 --> 11:12.291
(Principal) <i>And finally,</i>
<i>quicksand has been found</i>

11:12.375 --> 11:14.000
<i>in the creepy swamp behind the school.</i>

11:14.083 --> 11:17.500
<i>So, don't go in the creepy swamp.</i>
<i>There's quicksand!</i>

11:17.583 --> 11:19.000
-Did you hear what he said?
-Yeah!

11:19.083 --> 11:21.709
Go in the creepy swamp, there's quicksand!

11:23.041 --> 11:26.250
Oh, bad news, RC. There's a sign.

11:26.333 --> 11:29.333
(grunting) And a fence.

11:29.417 --> 11:32.000
Oh, I didn't even see the fence!

11:32.083 --> 11:35.333
Looks like we dragged that cinder block
all this way for nothing.

11:35.417 --> 11:38.959
No, Howard, I dragged this
cinder block all this way for nothing.

11:39.041 --> 11:40.667
And I won't let it be for nothing!

11:40.750 --> 11:42.083
(chuckling)

11:43.291 --> 11:44.750
(laughs) Yes!

11:44.834 --> 11:47.583
Chop it down! Chop it down!

11:48.500 --> 11:49.875
No!

11:50.000 --> 11:51.875
That book's going to ruin everything.

11:51.959 --> 11:54.250
Not this time! Nomicon don't own me!

11:54.333 --> 11:56.291
We came to swamp, we gonna swamp!

11:56.375 --> 12:00.041
In your face, Nomicon!

12:00.125 --> 12:01.542
Ninja Slice!

12:01.625 --> 12:04.375
(gasps) I can not believe you did that!

12:04.458 --> 12:07.792
Howard,
what say we go find ourselves some...

12:07.875 --> 12:09.875
(both) Quicksand!

12:09.959 --> 12:11.917
(laughing) Oh yes!

12:17.166 --> 12:19.750
(alarm ringing)

12:24.667 --> 12:27.208
-You check left!
-I'll take right!

12:28.083 --> 12:29.000
(screams)

12:30.375 --> 12:32.750
I've been snared like a possum!
Or is it opossum?

12:32.834 --> 12:35.667
An opossum? A opossum?
None of these sound right.

12:35.750 --> 12:38.041
Anyway, these guys don't know
who they're messin' with!

12:40.709 --> 12:42.750
Hello? Suit?

12:44.208 --> 12:45.667
Dangling in mid-air here.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.750
Could kinda use my suit
and my weapons and...

12:47.834 --> 12:49.208
Why isn't this working?

12:49.291 --> 12:50.792
-(leaves rustling)
-(gasps)

12:59.125 --> 13:02.333
-Ahh!
-How're you doin' over there, partner?

13:02.417 --> 13:04.834
-My name, Catfish.
-Hello, Mr. Catfish.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.625
My name's Ran... ginald Bagel.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.291
Ranginald Bagel. That's me.

13:09.375 --> 13:11.500
It seems I've been
mistakenly caught in your trap.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.875
Oh, there's no mistake
'bout it, Mr. Bagel.

13:14.959 --> 13:18.166
I'm the best trapper in these here parts.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.291
Or any parts. (chuckles)

13:20.375 --> 13:23.834
You danglin' 'cause you
criss-crossin' on my popaty.

13:23.917 --> 13:27.667
Oh no, sir. I would never
criss-cross on your "popaty."

13:27.750 --> 13:29.583
This is all just a big misunderstanding.

13:29.667 --> 13:30.750
It don't matter.

13:32.166 --> 13:35.000
Now you're my popaty.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.709
-(gasps)
-(phone ringing)

13:40.792 --> 13:44.083
-Howard?
-Cunningham? Found the quicksand.

13:44.166 --> 13:45.792
I'm dangling over it!

13:45.875 --> 13:47.834
I need the ninja! Hurry!

13:47.917 --> 13:49.709
OK, OK. Don't panic. I'll be right there.

13:49.792 --> 13:51.917
Actually, not right there,
'cause I'm sort of, kinda

13:52.000 --> 13:54.041
tied to the grill
of a psychopath's pickup truck.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.917
-And my Ninja suit doesn't work.
-Get off of speaker phone.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.041
It sounded like you said
your suit doesn't work.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.542
It doesn't. So just hang in there.

14:02.625 --> 14:04.750
Word play? At a time like this?

14:04.834 --> 14:07.417
-(phone beeps) <i>Call dropped.</i>
-(groaning)

14:12.083 --> 14:13.959
Oh boy.

14:14.041 --> 14:20.041
Get yourself some cozy.
This here is your new home.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.583
What the juice?

14:22.667 --> 14:25.375
I'm the boss of this here swamp. Me.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.458
All these critters? They do what I say.

14:28.542 --> 14:30.750
Ain't that right?

14:30.834 --> 14:33.792
I said, ain't that right!

14:33.875 --> 14:38.959
Ooh, a skinny mullet like you
gonna make me a nice coat rack yet.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.625
I just gotta fit you with a collar.

14:41.709 --> 14:43.250
So what size collar are you?

14:43.333 --> 14:46.500
I'm gonna say about a 15, 15 and a half...

14:46.583 --> 14:48.041
Why would I know that?

14:48.125 --> 14:50.375
(alarm ringing)

14:50.458 --> 14:54.000
It looks like someone else
been criss-crossing on my popaty!

14:55.417 --> 14:57.959
Now you keep an eye on Mr. Bagel.

14:58.041 --> 14:59.792
He act like a couyon,

14:59.875 --> 15:03.667
you have yourself a skinny mullet po' boy!

15:05.250 --> 15:07.291
Y'all rest, follow me!

15:10.333 --> 15:14.834
NinjaNomicon, I've been trapped in a cage
by some kind of swamp wizard.

15:14.917 --> 15:16.333
Why won't my Ninja suit work?

15:21.959 --> 15:23.000
Huh?

15:23.083 --> 15:25.709
"If you abuse the power,
you lose the power."

15:25.792 --> 15:27.792
So I lost my ninja powers
because I abused them.

15:27.875 --> 15:30.667
But not forever, right?
How do I get them back?

15:31.667 --> 15:33.166
Fine. You won't tell me?

15:33.250 --> 15:35.875
Then I'll just do this without the suit.

15:35.959 --> 15:39.125
Psst. You help free me,
I'll help you stop being a sofa.

15:39.208 --> 15:42.208
(growls)

15:42.291 --> 15:43.917
(gasps)

15:45.458 --> 15:46.709
You hungry?

15:46.792 --> 15:48.792
How'd you like a bite of couyon leg?

15:52.208 --> 15:53.542
-(gasps)
-(Howard screaming)

15:53.625 --> 15:55.000
I'm comin', Big H!

15:55.083 --> 15:56.875
(panting)

15:59.709 --> 16:01.417
And my mom said all those hours playing

16:01.500 --> 16:03.250
<i>SwampPuncher: Grand Theft Fanboat</i>

16:03.333 --> 16:05.333
-would amount to nothing!
-(phone rings)

16:05.417 --> 16:07.083
Howard? I'm coming to save you.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.792
-What?
-I'm coming to save you!

16:09.875 --> 16:13.250
I can't hear you!
It sounds like you're on a fanboat.

16:13.333 --> 16:15.041
I am on a fanboat!

16:15.125 --> 16:17.834
Oh man, I miss everything.

16:17.917 --> 16:19.542
Also, help!

16:23.000 --> 16:25.083
(screams)
If I don't make it through this...

16:25.166 --> 16:28.166
-Howard, you're going to make it.
-No, let me say this.

16:28.250 --> 16:30.834
In seventh grade,
when I borrowed your underpants,

16:30.917 --> 16:33.291
and returned them
and said they were clean?

16:33.375 --> 16:35.625
Not true! Not even close!

16:35.709 --> 16:37.667
Wait, wait, wait. How not clean?

16:37.750 --> 16:40.834
Adios, bromosabe.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.250
Howard? (groans)

16:47.750 --> 16:51.041
Ooh, now we gonna make gumbo.

16:51.125 --> 16:52.291
(screams)

16:52.375 --> 16:53.959
Don't even think about it, Booray.

16:54.041 --> 16:56.667
You's supposed to be in your cage, boy!

16:56.750 --> 16:58.583
You're not eating my friend.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.375
I ain't gonna eat your friend!

17:00.458 --> 17:02.625
They gonna eat your friend.

17:02.709 --> 17:06.250
-Then they gonna eat you.
-(gulping)

17:09.125 --> 17:11.041
Would you PJ up already?

17:11.125 --> 17:14.333
I can't! The mask is freezin'
me out because I abused my power!

17:14.417 --> 17:17.959
So, unabuse it and get us out of here!

17:18.041 --> 17:19.417
(snarling)

17:19.500 --> 17:21.000
(Howard screaming)

17:21.083 --> 17:22.333
(growls)

17:22.417 --> 17:24.083
No!

17:25.500 --> 17:27.667
-Whoa.
-I second that whoa two times.

17:27.750 --> 17:30.208
-Whoa, whoa!
-(bubbling)

17:30.291 --> 17:33.333
(gasps) No!

17:33.417 --> 17:36.542
Mr. Bagel just sacrificed himself for you.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.041
That was very noble...

17:38.125 --> 17:39.542
and stupid.

17:41.959 --> 17:44.959
(screams)

17:49.041 --> 17:52.000
(screaming)

17:53.542 --> 17:56.333
(shouting) Power unabused!

17:56.417 --> 17:58.291
Ninja! Yes!

17:58.375 --> 18:01.333
Ninja? What are you doin' down there?

18:01.417 --> 18:02.375
(growls)

18:02.458 --> 18:05.458
Stupid swamp panther!

18:07.875 --> 18:09.625
Oh, he name is Shaun.

18:09.709 --> 18:12.667
Shaun? Really? You named a panther Shaun.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.792
-Get him, Shaun!
-(growls)

18:14.875 --> 18:17.000
"Abuse the power, lose the power!"

18:17.083 --> 18:20.583
Ahh... That's it! The collar!

18:20.667 --> 18:22.792
You're free, Shaun.

18:22.875 --> 18:26.792
-(purring)
-You were totally abusing power, Booray.

18:26.875 --> 18:29.750
Wild animals should not be
controlled by magic collars.

18:29.834 --> 18:31.834
And that furniture thing was way wrong.

18:31.917 --> 18:34.917
Didn't even look comfortable. What's up
with having uncomfortable furniture?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.959
(snaps)

18:37.041 --> 18:39.750
Multiple Collar Slicing Ninja Rings!

18:41.125 --> 18:43.417
My swamp army!

18:43.500 --> 18:45.500
Getting a little light-headed here.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.583
Oops, my bad. Ninja Slice!

18:47.667 --> 18:49.500
Hi-yah!

18:49.583 --> 18:51.125
-(yelling)
-Let's go!

18:51.208 --> 18:54.500
(Booray) I'm afraid
I can't let you do that, Ninja.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.542
(laughs) What are you gonna do, Booray?

18:56.625 --> 18:58.083
Your beasts abandoned you.

18:58.166 --> 19:01.041
Oh, I still got a little
somethin'-somethin', yeah.

19:01.125 --> 19:03.375
This here my gris-gris.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.875
I got the power of the swamp!

19:05.959 --> 19:09.834
Oh, how Bruce for you.
I got the power of smoke bomb!

19:09.917 --> 19:11.667
You spilled my gumbos!

19:11.750 --> 19:14.417
Oh, mighty spirit of the swamp...

19:14.500 --> 19:19.125
conjure! Bewitch! Voodoo!

19:19.208 --> 19:21.792
-(rumbling)
-(laughing)

19:25.208 --> 19:27.166
(grunting)

19:29.083 --> 19:30.750
(gasps)

19:30.834 --> 19:33.458
He booby-trapped the whole swamp!

19:34.667 --> 19:36.750
Ninja Slice! Ninja Slice!

19:36.834 --> 19:38.250
(screaming)

19:42.500 --> 19:44.959
The fence! We made it! (gasps)

19:47.500 --> 19:50.250
It's a pythanthigator!

19:50.333 --> 19:54.000
(screeching)

19:54.083 --> 19:57.000
-Quick, through the hole.
-I'm not leaving without you.

19:57.083 --> 19:59.208
-(growling)
-I'll see you on the other side.

20:02.709 --> 20:04.000
-(growls)
-Yah!

20:06.083 --> 20:07.166
(shouting)

20:07.250 --> 20:08.500
(grunts)

20:14.458 --> 20:15.875
Ha! Did you see that?

20:15.959 --> 20:17.709
I hit him from over here.

20:17.792 --> 20:20.875
Me! You know how hard
it is to throw a cinder block?

20:20.959 --> 20:23.083
-(growling)
-Uh-oh!

20:25.875 --> 20:27.959
(yelling)

20:28.041 --> 20:31.834
(grunting) How do I stop this thing?

20:31.917 --> 20:33.417
Ah!

20:33.500 --> 20:35.500
-(growls)
-Ninja Pouch Slash!

20:35.583 --> 20:39.959
(growling, yelling)

20:40.041 --> 20:42.041
See you later, pythanthigator.

20:42.125 --> 20:44.834
-(giggling)
-Boo!

20:44.917 --> 20:48.000
You killed my gris-gris!

20:48.083 --> 20:49.667
And now that you lost your power,

20:49.750 --> 20:52.000
the animals want back they popaty!

20:52.083 --> 20:54.792
(growling, hissing)

20:54.875 --> 20:56.709
Hold on now, y'all!

20:56.792 --> 21:00.208
Ain't no reason to get ornery.

21:00.291 --> 21:02.000
(laughing)

21:02.083 --> 21:03.250
-(growls)
-I'm goin', I'm goin'.

21:03.333 --> 21:06.250
Cunningham,
the swamp has taught us a lesson today.

21:06.333 --> 21:10.083
The secret ingredient
in the delish gumbo is a pinch of me.

21:10.166 --> 21:12.709
True... and there's that thing
about my ninja powers.

21:12.792 --> 21:14.000
I abuse them, I lose them.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.709
Although you did get them back,

21:15.792 --> 21:18.083
so clearly there's some wiggle room.

21:18.166 --> 21:21.458
Nope, this ninja is
emergencies only from now on.

21:21.542 --> 21:22.750
Mr. Weinerman,

21:22.834 --> 21:26.417
what part of keep out of the creepy swamp
did you not understand?
