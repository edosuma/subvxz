00:30.780 --> 00:31.614
Please stop.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.657
My father taught us…

00:32.741 --> 00:33.908
God rest his soul.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.327
If you wanted the truth from somebody,

00:36.411 --> 00:39.873
you beat him <i>almost </i>to death

00:39.956 --> 00:41.916
before you start asking questions.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.711
It helps you understand
how fucking serious we are.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.881
Just take what you want.

00:47.964 --> 00:50.675
Now, where did you get this watch?

00:51.926 --> 00:53.428
That watch is mine.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.515
-Okay.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.185
No, no, no! Savvas.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.396
I'll beat the fuck out of him!

01:03.480 --> 01:04.898
Let the motherfucker speak!

01:04.981 --> 01:07.192
-To hell with him!
-Come on.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.234
Fuck!

01:09.819 --> 01:11.780
This watch
belonged to my brother.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.948
It was a gift.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.658
It was a gift!

01:15.742 --> 01:19.537
Either this <i>kologliftis </i>is lying
οr fucking Carlton is lying.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.460
Oh, God, no.

01:25.543 --> 01:28.171
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.006
You know Carlton?

01:36.513 --> 01:38.014
-Okay, kid.
-I told you.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.895
Let's get Carlton in here

01:43.978 --> 01:45.146
and find out what he knows.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.607
Maybe his brother's in on it too.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.027
If we need to,
we'll fucking kill 'em all.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.947
<i>Oh, we on Gene live, baby.</i>

01:54.030 --> 01:56.449
<i>I wanna add somebody.</i>
<i>One sec, guys. One quick sec.</i>

01:57.492 --> 01:58.701
Ari's his name.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.082
Ari's your fat brother.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.709
The one who ended up in the dumpster.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.628
He begged for mercy.

02:09.337 --> 02:10.213
He begged.

02:10.296 --> 02:13.675
Son of a bitch.
He's begging us to kill him.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.482
<i>That's not gonna happen tonight.</i>
<i>So, get it out of your heads…</i>

02:29.566 --> 02:32.193
<i>He's now referred to</i>
<i>as "Behind the Scenes Gene."</i>

02:32.277 --> 02:33.528
<i>It's big!</i>

02:34.279 --> 02:35.780
<i>"Behind the Scenes Gene."</i>

02:50.837 --> 02:52.714
Hey, come inside.

02:55.049 --> 02:55.967
Come on.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.852
Oh, shit.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.362
Did he say anything?

03:17.113 --> 03:18.114
Look at him.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.243
He confessed to killing our brother.

03:30.877 --> 03:31.794
Hey.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.005
Thank you for helping us find him.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.883
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

03:36.966 --> 03:40.011
Look, Ari was my friend. You know?

03:41.387 --> 03:42.305
Uh…

03:42.388 --> 03:45.475
Since y'all done what y'all did,
can we just get outta here, man?

03:47.018 --> 03:48.728
Carlton's right. We should leave.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.898
Should we
leave him or take him with us?

03:51.981 --> 03:54.108
Leave the motherfucker,
to hell with him.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.903
Grab his <i>portofóli</i>
and leave everything else.

03:56.986 --> 03:57.820
Where is it?

03:57.904 --> 03:59.948
How should I know?
Open your bloody eyes.

04:25.807 --> 04:26.766
Carlton.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.560
How'd you find out how to find this guy?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.604
Can we talk about this
when we get out of this lot?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.398
-Who told you?
-Hey, hey, hey.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.941
Calm down, kid.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.444
Look, you already
did the guy that did it, right?

04:39.988 --> 04:42.031
The person
who told me about this Gene guy,

04:42.115 --> 04:43.491
he don't know nothin'.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.451
He was just doing me a favor.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.578
He did me a favor, and he did it. That's…

04:47.662 --> 04:49.706
That's it.
He's got nothing to do with this.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.336
Who knows?

04:58.715 --> 04:59.632
Oh, shi--

04:59.716 --> 05:01.467
We're good. We're good.

05:08.641 --> 05:12.061
Look, tonight you showed us
you're not the person we thought you were.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.522
Lazy and arrogant.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.276
Tonight you showed us
you're our brother's friend.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.652
We appreciate that.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.660
All right, we'll see you around, Carlton.

06:36.604 --> 06:40.733
Wait. So you let your new piece of ass
talk trash about me in front of my son?

06:40.817 --> 06:41.651
<i>Okay, don't…</i>

06:41.734 --> 06:44.570
<i>First of all, don't call him that.</i>
<i>He was joking. Chris took it wrong.</i>

06:44.654 --> 06:47.156
Mo, are we<i>…</i> Are we kidding?

06:47.240 --> 06:50.201
You let this man talk trash
about me in front of my son,

06:50.284 --> 06:52.954
in the house that I bought you
that you and my son live in?

06:53.037 --> 06:56.457
That's a big fucking problem for me.
'Cause it's disrespectful.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.209
-It's disrespectful!
<i>-That's enough.</i>

06:58.292 --> 07:00.670
You understand why
he's wrong in what he did?

07:00.753 --> 07:02.588
<i>-It wasn't even like that.</i>
-Seriously!

07:02.672 --> 07:05.550
<i>He made a bad joke,</i>
<i>he didn't even know Chris was there.</i>

07:05.633 --> 07:07.844
Yeah, I got it now. Really, in truth,

07:07.927 --> 07:10.721
I don't give a fuck
if he was trying to be funny.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.391
Last I checked, only one of us
get paid to be funny, that's me.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.476
He don't get paid
to make people laugh. I do!

07:15.560 --> 07:18.938
So, it's disrespectful!
That's what it is. It's disrespectful!

07:19.021 --> 07:19.897
You know it is.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.400
<i>To tell me I disrespect you</i>

07:22.483 --> 07:26.028
<i>when I've stood by your side</i>
<i>more than anyone you've ever known</i>

07:26.112 --> 07:28.156
<i>is straight bullshit.</i>

07:28.239 --> 07:33.369
<i>I over-parent because you're too busy</i>
<i>out there trying to conquer the world.</i>

07:34.745 --> 07:39.709
<i>I'm just trying to have a life. Okay?</i>
<i>The man made a mistake, that's it.</i>

07:40.626 --> 07:41.711
<i>That's all.</i>

07:42.795 --> 07:47.049
<i>Don't you ever disrespect me</i>
<i>and try to call me a bad parent.</i>

07:47.133 --> 07:48.759
I never called you a bad parent.

07:53.014 --> 07:53.973
All right.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.559
I'm sorry.

07:57.894 --> 07:58.811
I apologize.

07:58.895 --> 07:59.812
<i>Look.</i>

08:00.938 --> 08:03.316
<i>I will make him apologize to Christian.</i>

08:05.443 --> 08:07.653
<i>But don't ever question my parenting.</i>

08:10.948 --> 08:14.076
Maybe y'all can just come out
to New York while I'm out there.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.913
<i>I think Christian would like that a lot.</i>

08:18.789 --> 08:21.876
<i>Look, I would…</i>
<i>I would never disrespect you.</i>

08:22.460 --> 08:23.419
I hear you.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.796
We can talk more about it face-to-face.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.299
Look, call, uh, Todd's assistant,

08:28.382 --> 08:31.260
have them book
the flights and shit. I gotta go.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.221
<i>Okay.</i>

08:33.763 --> 08:34.680
I love you.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.353
I mean that. I'm not, um…

08:41.729 --> 08:44.065
I'm not just saying that,
that's never gonna change.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.608
<i>I love you too.</i>

08:54.700 --> 08:58.496
<i> You do not need a set when</i>
<i>the product you're selling is amazing.</i>

08:58.579 --> 09:01.332
<i>And that's exactly what</i>
<i>these mattresses are.</i>

09:01.415 --> 09:04.001
-<i>Unbelievable. Dope.</i>

09:04.085 --> 09:07.380
<i>Whatever words you can think of.</i>
<i>Now here's the reality, people.</i>

09:07.463 --> 09:11.592
<i>You don't wanna see me standing</i>
<i>in Tahiti, or space, or a warehouse.</i>

09:11.676 --> 09:13.970
<i>That's not what you want</i>
<i>and it doesn't make sense.</i>

09:14.053 --> 09:17.765
<i>So, what I want is what you want,</i>
<i>for you to feel good and be better.</i>

09:17.848 --> 09:20.351
<i>You want a good mattress</i>
<i>so you can sleep comfortably.</i>

09:20.434 --> 09:22.144
<i>Plymouth Mattresses has 'em.</i>

09:22.228 --> 09:25.523
<i>So here comes the number</i>
<i>and the logo. Go get you one!</i>

09:31.571 --> 09:34.574
<i>That charity video</i>
<i>and spending time with that fan last night</i>

09:34.657 --> 09:35.950
<i>was such a great move.</i>

09:36.033 --> 09:38.744
<i> It was excellent.</i>
<i>It was angry, it was brilliant.</i>

09:38.828 --> 09:42.164
That's enough buttering up.
You're gonna give him a big head.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.501
We do have big news for you. I wanted
everybody to be together for this.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.877
-Oh, shit.
-Are you ready?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.588
-Yes.
-Okay. This is the big news.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.798
Alex? Go ahead and tell him.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.844
<i>The studio's talking about</i>
<i>an </i>Anti-Verse <i>spin-off for your character.</i>

09:54.927 --> 09:57.263
Oh, shit. I'm in. I'm in.

09:57.346 --> 09:58.764
-Whoo!
-I am in. I'm in.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.100
Oh! This is the thing.
We've been waiting for this.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.727
-Thank you.
-Yes!

10:02.810 --> 10:05.354
So, as soon as we get this
birthday thing worked out for Christian,

10:05.438 --> 10:06.480
we start in January--

10:06.564 --> 10:08.566
No. No, no, no. I can't do that.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.985
I told you, this divorce shit
is weighing on Christian,

10:11.068 --> 10:12.737
I gotta put some time in with him.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.155
January don't work for me.

10:14.238 --> 10:18.159
Right, but we've been working for January.
Hemsworth's window is in January.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.119
That's what we've been
talking to the studio about.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.370
Okay, but, I don't--

10:21.454 --> 10:23.623
<i>The studio needs</i>
<i>the sequel out by next summer.</i>

10:23.706 --> 10:27.001
<i>-So we're gonna have to start--</i>
-I don't wanna cut you off.

10:27.084 --> 10:30.379
But I'm clearly telling you
why I can't do it.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.506
I have to put time in with my son.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.968
Real time in, so I can't do it until fall.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.220
I don't think Hemsworth's
gonna have a problem with that.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.890
I hope so. But we need
to think about a compromise.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.600
Because we have a lot to protect now.

10:42.683 --> 10:46.270
Okay. What we need to <i>protect </i>is me.
Why do I have to tell you that, Todd?

10:46.979 --> 10:49.857
If you don't understand that,
what good are you to me? Tell me.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.025
What good are you to me?

10:51.108 --> 10:52.985
-My son is my priority.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.654
Make the studio understand that.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.114
If they don't,
then I don't do the fucking movie.

10:57.615 --> 10:58.908
It's that simple.

10:58.991 --> 11:02.078
Hey, guys, someone's knocking at the door.
Let us circle back to you.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.371
Hold tight.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.709
Pardon me, sir. These detectives
would like to speak with you.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.755
We'd like to talk to you
about Gene Aubachon.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.674
Gene Aubachon? Huh?

11:16.676 --> 11:18.594
-What about him?
-What's going on?

11:23.140 --> 11:25.559
Okay, so, you dropped Gene off.

11:25.643 --> 11:29.188
Did you have any contact with him after?
Phone calls, texts, anything?

11:29.271 --> 11:32.608
No, no, we dropped him off.
Then me and Hersch went back to the hotel.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.027
How does this fucking guy
get murdered the night he's out

11:35.111 --> 11:37.405
with the biggest star in Hollywood?
What are the odds?

11:38.489 --> 11:41.367
I'm gonna text my guy at TMZ
just in case. I wanna get ahead of it.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.411
Gene was alive when we left him.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.288
Kid was with me. We should be good.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.458
I can't believe
this shit is happening, man.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.877
We need to get
the fuck out of Philadelphia.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.091
<i>If you're not gonna reopen,</i>

11:57.174 --> 11:59.135
<i>we gotta start</i>
<i>repossessing the kitchen equipment.</i>

11:59.218 --> 12:00.970
You know what pisses me off?

12:01.053 --> 12:04.432
Everybody's concerned about themselves,
don't nobody give a fuck about me!

12:04.932 --> 12:06.267
You'll get your money.

12:09.687 --> 12:10.855


12:12.440 --> 12:14.817
Aw, shit. Oh, shit!

12:20.239 --> 12:22.032
<i>Grand jury testimony is to conclude--</i>

12:22.116 --> 12:23.993
<i>I think the index for the fourth…</i>

12:24.076 --> 12:26.287
-Shit.
-<i>But your employees can--</i>-

12:33.502 --> 12:34.754
Shitty-ass Car.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.839


12:39.467 --> 12:40.885


12:43.304 --> 12:44.388
Are you okay?

12:48.017 --> 12:48.851
Kid?

12:49.894 --> 12:50.936
Are you okay?

12:51.979 --> 12:52.813
Yeah.

12:53.689 --> 12:54.607
You sure?

12:54.690 --> 12:55.524
Yeah.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.181
Hey, hey.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.183
-Can we just--?
-No. Sit.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.522
Thank you.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.399
So, um…

13:39.276 --> 13:40.611
what happened to Gene?

13:41.278 --> 13:43.739
He was brutally beaten in his motel room.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.410
Why? Was it… Was it a robbery?

13:48.494 --> 13:51.247
Robberies usually aren't as brutal
as what happened to him.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.040
This was personal.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.211
He had every piece
of your professional career in his car.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.630
That's kind of creepy.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.549
-Right?
-I mean, yes and no.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.384
This… This is…

14:03.467 --> 14:06.762
This is common
when dealing with these type of fans.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.641
Gene was a good guy.
Gene was, like, my biggest fan.

14:11.392 --> 14:14.645
Every show, every tour,
he was always there.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.022
But you said you guys were friends, right?

14:17.606 --> 14:20.317
You were together last night
at a charity event?

14:21.652 --> 14:24.071
Yeah. We were… We were…

14:24.154 --> 14:27.950
Yes, but let me make this very clear,
the reason why I took him to the event

14:28.033 --> 14:30.828
was because earlier in the week,
I was an asshole to him.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.916
And-- Let me rephrase that.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.210
Not an asshole, like an asshole.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.588
It was-- I wasn't myself. All right?

14:40.671 --> 14:43.632
I was a different version of myself,
and I felt bad about that.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.093
I wanted to take him somewhere,
show him a good time,

14:46.176 --> 14:48.762
just to kinda make up,
you know, for that moment.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.682
Man, that must
have been quite a thrill for him, huh?

14:52.558 --> 14:53.642
Yeah, I guess so.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.688
Well, this is all
very helpful information.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.399
I wanted to participate,

15:00.482 --> 15:04.278
I wanted to show you guys that I was
more than willing to talk to you,

15:04.361 --> 15:07.489
give you whatever it is you need,
so you can rule me out of this.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.747
Uh…

15:14.830 --> 15:17.875
Rule you out? You were never ruled in.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.545
This guy was mauled.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.632
I mean, I think
it's pretty safe to say that, uh…

15:25.841 --> 15:27.176
…you're not a suspect.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.971
-Thanks for coming down.
-Yeah. Uh…

15:31.972 --> 15:33.015
You got it.

15:34.433 --> 15:38.479
It's crazy that he had all this stuff,
though, man. It's my whole life.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.482
Jesus Christ. Look at this.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.112
It's an article from when
I first started doing comedy.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.573
I don't even have this article.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.368
Well, if it wasn't part
of a murder investigation, it'd be yours.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.579
Um, before I go, just a question.

15:55.663 --> 15:59.083
The motel, they didn't
see anything or see anybody?

15:59.166 --> 16:03.545
No. The motel doesn't have much of
a security system outside of the office.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.465
The type of people who use it
don't wanna be recorded.

16:06.548 --> 16:07.466
Fuck.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.385
That's terrible.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.011
Hmm.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.141
Well. All right, thank you guys, man.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.145
Hey. Would you mind signing
something for the station?

16:21.605 --> 16:22.690
Cool. Yeah.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.195
-You want me to sign that?
-Mm-hmm.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.072
Wow.

16:30.614 --> 16:34.118
-Um, to who?
-To the 13th District, by the way.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.285
If that's cool.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.955
Hey, and keep your head on a swivel

16:38.038 --> 16:41.000
just in case this is more about you
than something random.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.502
Will do. Thank you.

16:54.263 --> 16:57.099
Man, I asked them
to lock this down. Somebody leaked it.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.560
I'm thinking
we should move our flights up.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.145
Get everybody out of Philly, huh?

17:01.228 --> 17:03.397
No. I gotta see Carlton now.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.443
It's like we're in
an episode of <i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

17:07.526 --> 17:09.236
But the Black comedy world version.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.656
I'm gonna talk to the studio.
This will not fuck up our deal, but I--

17:12.740 --> 17:13.782
We're gonna make sure.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.163
Hey, Hersch.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.041
-You wanna go to his place?
-No. The restaurant.

17:22.791 --> 17:23.959
You got it.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.221
We can wait here for you. Okay?

17:38.474 --> 17:40.017
It's gonna take a while.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.064
This has gotta be
the weirdest trip I've ever been on.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.598
What happened, man?

18:21.642 --> 18:23.602
What happened is,
I did what needed to be done.

18:23.685 --> 18:24.728
That's what happened.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.440
Especially since you thinking
you can get your fans to do

18:28.524 --> 18:30.943
-whatever you want 'em to do.
-He erased the video, C.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.823
It wasn't just about erasing the video, K.

18:38.992 --> 18:41.411
I realized that
when detectives came to my door.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.958
For a split second,
I thought to myself, I was like, "Shit."

18:46.041 --> 18:48.710
"That's why they're taking me in,
they gotta know."

18:49.545 --> 18:51.004
Then it dawned on me.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.134
I realized you was right.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.265
Even without the video,
he would have brought danger to us.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.153
I didn't want the dude to die, man.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.491
But then I realized
that he wasn't much different than Ari.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.035
How so?

19:24.121 --> 19:26.874
They both had something on us, K.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.348
You protected me.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.601
You protected us.

19:46.768 --> 19:47.936
Thank you.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.941
I mean it, C. Thank you.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.156
What now?

19:59.990 --> 20:02.534
I mean, with Ari's brothers.
Are they good? Are we done?

20:02.618 --> 20:04.036
Like, where does this put us?

20:05.162 --> 20:06.872
No, we good. We good.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.583
They got what they needed.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.632
Feel like we got a fucking cloud over us,
man, like we just cursed.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.218
Cursed?

20:20.510 --> 20:24.139
Man, you went on
and became famous and rich.

20:25.515 --> 20:28.227
There's a whole lotta people
wished they was cursed like that.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.813
It ain't what you think it is, man.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.818
It's a lotta shit you don't know about,
shit I ain't never tell you, C.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.864
You know, I went years, man.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.284
Years, I was fucking homeless.

20:46.536 --> 20:49.039
People taking advantage of me
because I was desperate.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.917
Developed a goddamn addiction.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.336
That shit lasted
for I don't know for how long.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.632
Then I finally get on my feet,

20:58.715 --> 21:02.261
I finally get back to a place
where feel like I got balance. I'm on a…

21:02.344 --> 21:04.221
I'm on a fuckin' good path.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.517
I wake up with a dead girl in my bed.

21:14.564 --> 21:15.816
Well, it's over now.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.694
It's over now.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.579
Let's pay our respects to Gene, man.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.857
R.I.P., your man, Gene.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.775
R.I.P., Gene.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.405
Thank you for giving me
the second chance that you said I deserve.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.671
You know, uh,
I got one more confession to make.

22:20.630 --> 22:21.631
I, uh…

22:24.843 --> 22:26.219
I saw your movie.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.473
That shit was funny.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.771
I know you went to go see my movie, man.

22:39.858 --> 22:43.236
What do you say, when I'm done with
the East Coast leg of my tour, we, uh…

22:44.363 --> 22:46.031
we get this place back open?

22:50.702 --> 22:51.787
I'd like that.

22:55.791 --> 22:56.833
Me too.

23:25.278 --> 23:26.488
Oh, shit.

23:28.323 --> 23:31.034
Dropped your goddamn phone.

23:34.663 --> 23:38.291
Goddamn, man.
You owe everybody money, huh?

23:47.342 --> 23:49.344


24:21.877 --> 24:24.629
<i> I know you said stay calm</i>
<i>until your brother leaves Philly,</i>

24:24.713 --> 24:26.548
<i>but your ass can't call to check-in?</i>

24:27.299 --> 24:30.719
<i>Hello? Carlton, fucking answer me!</i>
