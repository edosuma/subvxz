WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:08.276
(drumroll)

00:08.342 --> 00:11.479
(rousing orchestral
fanfare playing)

00:23.491 --> 00:25.359
(fanfare ends)

00:37.037 --> 00:41.142
(funky music playing)

01:08.102 --> 01:11.071
(indistinct conversations)

01:14.041 --> 01:15.809
(laughing)

01:25.153 --> 01:28.556
* *

01:32.126 --> 01:35.296
(feedback screeching)

01:46.940 --> 01:49.243
(panting)

01:49.310 --> 01:53.181
(Spanish guitar music plays)
(children shouting)

01:57.151 --> 01:59.587
(speaking Spanish in background)

02:23.010 --> 02:25.746
(indistinct whispers in
distance)

02:35.022 --> 02:37.491
(clucking)

02:53.207 --> 02:54.242
Ahí está.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.258
MAN:
Uh, what about

03:10.324 --> 03:11.992
"The Big One only gets bigger"?

03:12.059 --> 03:13.961
"Everyone wants
a Big One."

03:14.027 --> 03:14.928
I got a big one.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.330
(all laughing)
Sorry.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.798
How about
just, like,

03:17.865 --> 03:19.032
"Eat me"?

03:19.099 --> 03:20.401
(all laughing)

03:20.468 --> 03:22.736
Okay, okay, so there's
no shortage of future slogans.

03:22.803 --> 03:23.971
Phil, what have you got?

03:24.037 --> 03:29.410
Well, um, same-store sales
are up 8.4% this quarter,

03:29.477 --> 03:31.745
which is just amazing,

03:31.812 --> 03:34.582
and the increase extends
across every demographic.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.985
It's tweens, heavy
users, minivan dads,

03:38.051 --> 03:39.553
even seniors.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.454
So clearly,

03:40.521 --> 03:42.256
the Big One is not only
a big hit,

03:42.323 --> 03:44.592
it is quickly becoming
the flagship of our brand.

03:44.658 --> 03:45.893
Which we'll be building on,

03:45.959 --> 03:47.961
both in the upcoming second half
of our campaign

03:48.028 --> 03:49.830
and in merchandising.
Terrific.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.099
Don, what about
those Little Big Ones?

03:52.165 --> 03:54.268
Well, uh, last week,
you know,

03:54.335 --> 03:56.370
we did a pretty extensive
focus group

03:56.437 --> 03:57.638
with, uh, some
of the kids

03:57.705 --> 03:59.273
from Martin Luther
King Elementary.
Yeah?

03:59.340 --> 04:00.341
And it went great.

04:00.408 --> 04:03.043
Tested 91%
in the top three boxes.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.044
They loved 'em.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.245
What is it now?

04:05.313 --> 04:06.547
Eight to a bag?

04:06.614 --> 04:09.249
No, no, no, you're thinking
about the Itty-Bitties.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.318
Oh.
No, no.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.052
We figure three
Little Big Ones

04:12.119 --> 04:14.422
for each kids' meal is gonna
work out about right.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.689
But we want to do

04:15.756 --> 04:17.190
a little more testing
on that as well.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.627
How about Disney?

04:20.793 --> 04:22.095
No word yet.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.964
Also, the PBS deal

04:24.031 --> 04:25.766
doesn't seem to be happening.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.701
Uh, apparently,
Burger King and McDonald's

04:27.768 --> 04:30.270
have the Teletubbies
all locked up.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.341
Fuck 'em.

04:43.851 --> 04:44.918
That's wonderful.

04:44.985 --> 04:45.953
Yeah, you like that?

04:46.019 --> 04:47.020
That's the barbecue Big One.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.390
Wow.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.924
Tastes like it's right
off the grill.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.527
You don't think it needs, like,
liquid smoke or any other kind

04:53.594 --> 04:54.628
of flavorings?
No.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.063
No, no, no,
I think it's perfect.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.331
Let's test that.
Okay.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.832
Try this one.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.508
I don't know.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.577
Yeah, I mean these Caribbean
seasonings are kind of tricky.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.879
Well, we're calling them
Calypso Chicken Tenders.

05:11.945 --> 05:16.517
I-I-I think people are going
to have an expectation for a...

05:16.584 --> 05:17.785
maybe a touch of lime.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.720
Oh, well, lime.
L-Lime's easy.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.655
I just held back on the
Terpinoline on this

05:21.722 --> 05:22.656
to keep the flavoring subtle,

05:22.723 --> 05:24.257
but I can
always go back

05:24.324 --> 05:27.027
and add more.
Yeah, why don't you try that?

05:27.094 --> 05:28.261
I'll keep working on it.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.262
JACK:
Okay, I really enjoyed it.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.263
You were wonderful.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.199
Yeah, yeah.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.401
Okay.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.868
Ah, look, I got to go.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.937
I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, bye.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.508
Thanks, Louise.

05:41.475 --> 05:45.312
Donny Boy...
have a seat.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.715
Thanks for stopping by.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.083
So, what do you
think of everything?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.452
It's good, good.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.987
I'm glad to see
the Big One doing so well.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.188
(chuckles quietly)

05:55.255 --> 05:58.392
Listen, you ever run into
a guy named Harry Rydell?

05:58.459 --> 06:00.894
Executive VP out of
the Chicago office?

06:00.961 --> 06:02.362
I don't think so.

06:02.430 --> 06:06.133
He works closely
with our suppliers.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.968
A little too closely,

06:08.035 --> 06:09.837
if you ask me.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.071
What do you mean?

06:11.138 --> 06:15.509
I have a friend that teaches
food science over at A&M.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.678
Microbiology.

06:17.745 --> 06:21.014
And this semester, a couple
of his grad students decided

06:21.081 --> 06:22.450
to culture some patties

06:22.516 --> 06:24.317
from a bunch of
fast food chains.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.086
Uh-huh.
Well...

06:26.153 --> 06:27.387
(sighs)

06:27.455 --> 06:29.857
They got ahold
of a couple Big Ones.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.024
The frozen patties.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.726
Don't ask me how.

06:32.793 --> 06:36.096
And the fecal coliform counts
were just off the charts.

06:36.163 --> 06:40.768
I'm concerned that this
could be a problem for us.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.036
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

06:46.106 --> 06:47.608
Not exactly.

06:49.309 --> 06:52.880
I'm saying
there's shit in the meat.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.925
* *

07:45.232 --> 07:46.500
"The drawbridge was down.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.869
"The great gate stood wide.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.038
"I entered
without challenge,

07:51.104 --> 07:55.208
my own heels making
the only sounds I heard."

07:55.943 --> 07:57.678
Keep going.

07:57.745 --> 07:58.579
No.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.080
It's bedtime.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.349
Just one more.

08:02.415 --> 08:03.416
Please?

08:03.483 --> 08:04.752
No, that's it.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.289
Hey...

08:09.356 --> 08:11.925
(kiss)
Good night, Stevie.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.862
Hey.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.429
I think I may
have to miss

08:16.496 --> 08:18.065
your history exhibit
on Thursday.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.199
Why?

08:19.266 --> 08:22.335
Well, you know how Daddy
has to go out of town

08:22.402 --> 08:24.037
for work every
now and then.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.773
Yeah, but I thought
you didn't have to...

08:25.839 --> 08:28.576
Well, not as much, but
I gotta go to Colorado

08:28.642 --> 08:31.511
for a couple of
days, all right?

08:31.579 --> 08:32.980
I'll be home for
the weekend, though.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.347
Okay.

08:35.414 --> 08:38.018
Love you guys.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.621
Too much E coli and stuff.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.289
REPORTER:
Suspect is now on foot,
fleeing...

08:42.355 --> 08:43.490
People could get sick.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.093
Is that the one
that can kill kids?

08:46.159 --> 08:47.427
I don't know.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.829
I don't think so.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.397
I mean, nobody's gotten sick
or anything.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.933
But Jack says

08:53.000 --> 08:56.036
too much cow manure is
somehow getting into the meat.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.705
That's disgusting.

08:57.771 --> 08:58.872
That's my new job.

08:58.939 --> 08:59.907
Same office.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.375
Still dealing with bullshit.

09:02.442 --> 09:05.813
WOMAN:
Well, I guess it is
a marketing issue after all.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.048
If the kids die from
eating your burgers,

09:08.115 --> 09:09.783
it makes them much
harder to sell.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.219
That's right.
Marketing 101.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.354
Don't kill the customer.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.355
Bad for repeat business.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.190
(laughs)

09:47.554 --> 09:50.590
(panicked shouting)

10:00.500 --> 10:03.203
Coco?

10:03.270 --> 10:04.972
(horn honking)

10:05.038 --> 10:06.206
Coco?

11:02.262 --> 11:04.998
* *

11:45.705 --> 11:48.241
(cell phone ringing)

11:49.342 --> 11:51.144
Hi.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.180
No.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.450
I sent that form in.
I paid it.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.253
Mira, you tell that
coach and that whole
fucking league,

12:00.320 --> 12:03.757
if he doesn't play,
I'm gonna kick all their asses.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.760
Sí. Yeah, yeah.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.329
I just did a pick-up.
I-I'll talk to you later.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.593
(Spanish guitar music playing)

14:11.351 --> 14:13.286
* *

14:24.264 --> 14:25.933
(panting)

14:31.939 --> 14:33.240
(chokes)

14:43.316 --> 14:45.318
* *

15:11.844 --> 15:13.981
(mooing)

15:30.630 --> 15:33.300
(mooing continues)

15:43.010 --> 15:45.112
(mooing continues)

15:46.646 --> 15:48.481
(sighs)

16:06.666 --> 16:08.601
* *

16:42.635 --> 16:44.537
(turns engine off)

17:02.555 --> 17:04.757
(soccer announcer speaking
Spanish on TV)

17:05.858 --> 17:07.094
(banging on door)

17:12.832 --> 17:14.367
WOMAN:
No.

17:16.669 --> 17:17.770
Sí.
Sí.
Sí.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.881
(erotic moans on TV)

17:28.948 --> 17:30.250
WOMAN #1:
Oh, God, yeah.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.784
WOMAN #2: Yeah, you like
the way that feels?

17:31.851 --> 17:34.053
(women moaning)

17:35.922 --> 17:38.125
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.227
Oh, that's
right, bitch.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.395
(both continue moaning)

17:43.563 --> 17:45.265
You like it when
I pull your hair?

17:45.332 --> 17:47.134
Yes. Yes,
pull my hair.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.269
Oh!
That's right, slut.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.704
Oh. Oh, I love it when
you call me slut.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.941
Let's go, stand up.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.576
Yo, stand up.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.810
Come on, stand up.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.281
Hey!

18:03.150 --> 18:05.318
Stand up.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.325
The fuck you doing?

18:16.095 --> 18:18.265
Fucking people on vacation.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.103
Go.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.115
(kissing)

18:48.228 --> 18:50.363
(sighs)

19:05.178 --> 19:07.046
(chuckles)
(door opens)

19:07.113 --> 19:08.615
Hang on a second.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.653
Welcome to Mickey's.
Can I take your order?

19:16.055 --> 19:18.991
Yeah. I'm thinking
about...

19:19.058 --> 19:20.260
a Big One.
Okay.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.229
Would you like some
large fries with that?

19:22.295 --> 19:24.664
No, no, thanks.
Not tonight.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.132
Our super-value drink?

19:26.199 --> 19:28.401
I'll have a chocolate
shake and a water.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.669
All right.
(register beeps)

19:29.736 --> 19:31.137
Would you like
any dessert with that?

19:31.204 --> 19:32.972
A brownie pie or a turnover?

19:33.039 --> 19:35.141
No, not tonight.
Okay.

19:35.208 --> 19:38.578
(register beeping)
Uh, that'll be $4.98.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.281
Okay. Here you go.
(register opening)

19:42.782 --> 19:44.851
(register closing)

19:44.917 --> 19:46.686
So what's your favorite
thing on the menu?

19:46.753 --> 19:48.455
I like everything.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.790
Well, I know
that's not true.
(laughing)

19:50.857 --> 19:53.125
But you did give me
the correct answer.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.694
I was just testing you.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.796
I'm actually a
vice president of
marketing for Mickey's.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.566
Really?
Yeah. It's true.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.200
Just here in town
for a couple of days

20:01.268 --> 20:03.169
seeing where the
Big Ones come from.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.771
Here?

20:04.837 --> 20:06.439
Oh, no, not here.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.475
But at Uniglobe Meat Packing,
just outside of town.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.277
That's where every
single Big One patty

20:10.343 --> 20:12.545
in the entire
country gets made.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.946
No way!

20:14.013 --> 20:15.648
Yeah...

20:15.715 --> 20:16.749
It's amazing.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.117
Wow.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.853
(mumbling):
Lettuce.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.722
Pickles.

20:22.789 --> 20:23.823
Pickles and cheese.

20:25.892 --> 20:26.959
Special...
(squirts)

20:30.263 --> 20:32.299
Think I burned the meat.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.712
Amber!

20:45.778 --> 20:47.414
Order up.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.654
There you go.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.956
Okay, thank you.
What's your name?

20:57.023 --> 20:58.858
Amber.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.259
Right.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.594
Don Anderson.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.496
It's nice to meet you.
You, too.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.931
Maybe I'll see you around.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.733
All right.
I'm always here.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.801
(giggles)

21:09.836 --> 21:11.871
Brian, can I get
a coffee freezer?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.742
* *

21:46.005 --> 21:47.940
* *

22:16.135 --> 22:18.805
* *

22:30.316 --> 22:32.385
(tires screeching)

22:32.452 --> 22:36.088
Que si, que esta bien
que los lleves.

23:29.442 --> 23:33.079
(indistinct shouting)

23:33.145 --> 23:36.115
(sprayers whooshing)

23:54.166 --> 23:56.135
(indistinct voices)

24:01.508 --> 24:03.643
(beeping)

24:11.884 --> 24:16.656
Amber, hon, electric is $131
for last month.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.459
Mom, I got to pay
my car insurance.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.595
Well, anything helps.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.964
So how's your day looking?

24:25.031 --> 24:27.700
I have band practice after
school and work at 6:00.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.002
Well, don't let 'em keep you
past 10:00.

24:31.638 --> 24:32.939
I'll try to get
out of there.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.974
Tony's been pretty cool
about letting me out early.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.909
(blowing)

24:36.976 --> 24:38.110
Good.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.696
(engine sputters, then turns)

25:10.743 --> 25:13.846
(overlapping chatter)

25:15.815 --> 25:17.116
Hey.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.220
Hey, Amber.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.889
Hi, Clayton.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.188
Hola.
Hola.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.775
(indistinct voices)

27:29.515 --> 27:32.651
* *

27:51.537 --> 27:53.272
MAN:
And right over
here, Don,

27:53.339 --> 27:55.674
we mix our product
with a low-fat product

27:55.742 --> 27:58.010
from about a half
a dozen other plants.

28:08.721 --> 28:11.390
* *

28:25.104 --> 28:27.306
We're liquefying gas
in a cylinder.

28:27.373 --> 28:30.910
Takes 'em down to 40
degrees below zero.

28:52.298 --> 28:53.866
DON:
Wow.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.301
That's a lot
of Big Ones.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.703
Yeah.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.872
Well, somewhere
in Kansas City,

28:59.939 --> 29:01.740
someone will be eating
these tomorrow night.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.632
NARRATOR:
...it can be used to explain

29:26.698 --> 29:29.035
how accidents happen
to other people.

29:29.101 --> 29:32.271
But accidents don't just
happen to other people.

29:32.338 --> 29:36.308
Accident prevention is each
individual's responsibility.

29:36.375 --> 29:39.478
This program is designed
to make you think more

29:39.545 --> 29:43.749
about accident causes and
how you can prevent injuries.

29:43.816 --> 29:46.485
If you eliminate the cause
of accidents,

29:46.552 --> 29:49.221
you're on your way to an
accident-free workplace

29:49.288 --> 29:50.622
and lifetime.

29:50.689 --> 29:53.559
Safety works in your home, also.
It works when you're...

29:59.531 --> 30:00.766
Yo.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.402
You heard about the robbery
last night?

30:03.469 --> 30:04.670
No. Where?

30:04.736 --> 30:06.372
The McDonald's over on Cayenne.

30:06.438 --> 30:09.075
They came in at closing time and
put everyone in the basement.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.877
Said they'd got shot
if they came out

30:10.943 --> 30:12.811
and boomed $6,000.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.280
No way.
Yeah.

30:14.346 --> 30:15.714
$6,000 in cash.

30:15.781 --> 30:17.616
In cash?
Hells, yeah.

30:17.683 --> 30:19.051
How many times you seen somebody

30:19.118 --> 30:20.619
buy their McNuggets
with a credit card?

30:20.686 --> 30:21.888
Good point.

30:21.954 --> 30:23.522
You know, they said it was
the third fast food place

30:23.589 --> 30:25.691
in Cody to get robbed
in the last few weeks.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.759
They hit Fuddruckers
on Thursday night.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.462
We're probably next.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.231
All the more reason
for you guys to quit.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.633
I mean, why do you
even work there?

30:34.700 --> 30:37.469
Not all of us can get hired
at the Banana Republic.

30:44.376 --> 30:47.446
Oh. What the fuck you
all doing in my truck?

30:51.517 --> 30:52.718
COCO:

30:52.784 --> 30:53.719
SYLVIA:

30:53.785 --> 30:54.954
Mike.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.504
Yeah, the Big One's
been great.

31:12.571 --> 31:13.940
Really great.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.708
Sales keep creeping up.

31:16.775 --> 31:17.676
There's been
no drop-offs.

31:17.743 --> 31:19.478
That's what we're hearing.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.847
Listen, I've had
this location 12 years.
Yeah.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.950
And, uh, you'd have
to go way back.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.417
Maybe even to the original

31:25.484 --> 31:27.586
Teeny-Weenie's promotion
to see anything like this.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.088
You guys hit a home run.

31:29.155 --> 31:30.856
Well, hey, we all did.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.059
Definitely.

31:34.426 --> 31:39.365
Hey, Tony, have you ever, um,
ever been out to UMP plant?

31:39.431 --> 31:40.967
Uh, no, I haven't.

31:42.969 --> 31:45.171
Been hearing some mixed things
about the place.

31:45.237 --> 31:48.807
I've heard all sorts of nasty
stuff goes on there.

31:48.874 --> 31:49.942
You have?

31:50.009 --> 31:52.244
Like what?

31:53.679 --> 31:58.050
I don't know, um, just have a
friend who used to work there.

31:58.117 --> 32:01.287
And, uh, he used to tell me
all sorts of things.

32:01.353 --> 32:04.290
Did you know that's where
the Big Ones come from?

32:06.225 --> 32:08.227
Well, this was
a long time back, I mean...

32:08.294 --> 32:10.429
Look, my friend could have been
full of shit.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.831
Yeah, 'cause I was out there,
I mean, the place is...

32:12.898 --> 32:15.601
It's spotless.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.269
Yeah?
Oh, yeah.

32:17.336 --> 32:20.106
It's hi-tech, state
of the art stuff.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.574
Stainless steel everywhere,
people wearing gloves

32:22.641 --> 32:25.477
and clean white coats,
I mean... (clucks tongue)

32:25.544 --> 32:27.646
Yeah, might be
a lot different now.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.755
So, um... the friend,
you think, I might

32:36.822 --> 32:38.024
be able to give
him a call?

32:38.090 --> 32:40.059
I don't know,
he split a long time ago.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.328
I mean, I haven't really
talked to him.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.968
You know, my wife's got
an uncle,

32:50.036 --> 32:51.737
he can tell you all
about that place.

32:51.803 --> 32:52.904
Does he work out there?

32:52.971 --> 32:54.773
Oh, no, no, he used
to sell them cattle.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.343
But he's a real
character, you know.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.178
Been on the ranch
a little too long.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.514
You think he'd talk to me?

33:02.581 --> 33:04.083
Oh, he'll talk to you.

33:04.150 --> 33:07.353
Might scare you, though.
He's a little intense.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.488
Let me give you his number.

33:09.555 --> 33:12.158
His name is Rudy.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.596
(man shouting in Spanish)

33:22.000 --> 33:23.469
(woman shouting in Spanish)

33:23.535 --> 33:25.371
Hey. Hey!

33:25.437 --> 33:26.738
What the fuck
are you doing?

33:26.805 --> 33:28.074
The fuck?

33:28.140 --> 33:30.476
Are you fucking retarded?

33:38.450 --> 33:40.619
Say it. "Grade A."
Say it.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.020
Grade A.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.989
Thank you. I fucking
know you understand me.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.557
You people act like
I'm a fucking retard.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.199
Sí.
Get back to work.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.226
Coco.

35:05.871 --> 35:08.840
(Spanish-language hip-hop
playing)
(woman moaning)

35:10.909 --> 35:12.411
(both moaning)

35:12.478 --> 35:14.913
Yeah, like that,
like that.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.882
Like that, like that...

35:16.948 --> 35:17.983
Fucking...

35:18.049 --> 35:19.551
(grunts)

35:19.618 --> 35:21.720
(Coco moaning)

35:21.787 --> 35:23.889
(Mike grunting)

35:41.607 --> 35:44.075
You know, if that safe
at McDonald's

35:44.142 --> 35:47.112
was holding six grand, Tony
must have at least five or six

35:47.179 --> 35:48.180
locked away in there.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.382
Maybe more.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.150
Think he goes
to the bank every day?

35:52.218 --> 35:54.653
That's a good question.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.589
Tim says that
over where he works,

35:57.656 --> 35:59.358
that they don't even
have a safe.

35:59.425 --> 36:01.993
That's 'cause nobody
ever eats there, man.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.662
Chicken fajita I
had the other night

36:03.729 --> 36:04.763
was some slimy shit.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.534
Yeah, well, there's a reason
why it only costs 99 cents.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.937
There may be five or six grand

36:12.003 --> 36:13.539
in Tony's safe every night

36:13.605 --> 36:15.274
just sitting in there,
while we're out here

36:15.341 --> 36:17.209
getting paid dick
to mess with this shit.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.678
Yeah, no kidding.

36:19.745 --> 36:21.480
And Tony's a real
prick, too, you know?

36:21.547 --> 36:23.949
I always catch him
checking out Amber's ass.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.917
He's, like, five
times her age.

36:25.984 --> 36:28.454
Hey, the cops...

36:28.520 --> 36:31.657
must have these places
totally staked out at night.

36:31.723 --> 36:35.761
(whispering):
'Cause they're just
waitin' for another robbery.

36:35.827 --> 36:37.162
The best time to do it

36:37.229 --> 36:39.097
would be first thing
in the morning

36:39.164 --> 36:40.599
around opening time.

36:40.666 --> 36:43.635
Okay. Here's how it goes down.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.604
We come in here first
thing in the morning.

36:45.671 --> 36:48.073
Uh-huh.
It's still dark,
no traffic.

36:48.139 --> 36:50.942
Everybody's feeling
calm and sleepy.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.779
(imitates cocking gun)

36:53.845 --> 36:57.316
We'll be takin' this
order to go, motherfucker.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.685
If you've got
the balls, bitch.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.654
(imitates gunshot)

37:02.721 --> 37:04.055
DON:
Well, later today, I'm supposed

37:04.122 --> 37:06.492
to go out to some ranch;
maybe that'll

37:06.558 --> 37:09.094
be worth something.
I don't know.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.331
Well, I'm meeting
with Harry on Friday.

37:12.398 --> 37:13.365
(TV playing low)

37:13.432 --> 37:15.434
So I should be back on Saturday.

37:15.501 --> 37:17.202
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
pu-put him on.

37:17.269 --> 37:19.905
NARRATOR:
...forget the animal advocates,
but the disease that spreads...

37:19.971 --> 37:22.040
Who's this?

37:22.107 --> 37:25.243
Hello, Stevie.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.333
(knocking)

37:47.966 --> 37:50.201
(speaking Spanish)

37:50.268 --> 37:52.471
(door beeps)

38:26.438 --> 38:30.241
Couple of guys invited
me to a party at the U
on Saturday night.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.010
You want to come?

38:32.077 --> 38:34.112
Do they know
you go to Cody?

38:34.179 --> 38:35.981
For some reason,
they think

38:36.047 --> 38:37.115
I'm a freshman
in college.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.551
(laughing):
Oh, I wonder why?

38:39.618 --> 38:41.653
One of them
is really hot.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.890
Oh... I gotta
work that night.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.926
You work way too much.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.711
* *

39:15.521 --> 39:16.988
You the one that called?

39:17.055 --> 39:19.090
Yeah, hi there. I'm Don.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.892
Climb on over.

39:29.901 --> 39:33.439
RUDY:
Ever been out here before?
Nope.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.341
It's beautiful.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.910
You ever been on a ranch before?

39:38.977 --> 39:42.147
Yeah. When I was a kid.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.550
At camp.

39:45.951 --> 39:48.554
DON:
How, uh, how many
acres do you have, Rudy?

39:48.620 --> 39:50.656
Well, you wouldn't
want to have to walk

39:50.722 --> 39:53.124
your way out of here,
that's for sure.

40:02.333 --> 40:04.903
Come on up and meet
my new neighbors.

40:04.970 --> 40:08.206
Oh... no.

40:08.273 --> 40:10.476
Aw, jeez.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.112
When did all this happen?
The last couple of years.

40:15.647 --> 40:18.183
Local ranchers lost
control of the land.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.218
The banks took
it and sold it

40:20.285 --> 40:21.653
to real estate
speculators.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.102
What the hell
happened over there?

40:37.168 --> 40:39.070
Meth freaks.

40:39.137 --> 40:40.572
Out here?

40:40.639 --> 40:42.440
They find a quiet,
little place,

40:42.508 --> 40:45.176
start cooking till
something blows up

40:45.243 --> 40:47.913
or burns down.
Wow.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.716
Past year
and a half,

40:50.782 --> 40:53.485
I've had two bodies
dumped on my land.

40:53.552 --> 40:55.687
Dead bodies?

40:55.754 --> 40:59.457
One of 'em was rolled up
in this nice-looking carpet.

40:59.525 --> 41:00.959
Scared the shit out
of my foreman.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.496
They've dumped
dead dogs and cats

41:04.563 --> 41:06.598
and all other sorts
of garbage on my land.

41:06.665 --> 41:09.034
Seems like I spend
half my time just

41:09.100 --> 41:11.236
defending the place.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.905
I gotta go to court next week

41:13.972 --> 41:17.142
to fight off some
private corporation

41:17.208 --> 41:20.378
from Denver that wants to build
a toll road across my land.

41:20.445 --> 41:22.748
Eminent domain, my ass.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.016
They've got another
word for it:

41:25.083 --> 41:27.753
robbery.

41:31.389 --> 41:33.224
You want to open
that up for me?

41:48.674 --> 41:51.242
You should
get a clicker.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.244
(laughs)

41:55.280 --> 41:57.115
Hey, Rudy?

41:57.182 --> 41:59.751
You know anybody over
at Uniglobe Meat Packing?

41:59.818 --> 42:00.886
Sure.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.721
What do you
think of 'em?

42:02.788 --> 42:04.956
I think they're a fine bunch.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.858
Really?

42:06.925 --> 42:09.360
They'll slit your throat
for a nickel.

42:09.427 --> 42:10.896
Nothing personal,

42:10.962 --> 42:12.598
they just want
the extra nickel.

42:14.065 --> 42:15.601
Well, who do you
know over there?

42:15.667 --> 42:18.103
I know all of them.

42:18.169 --> 42:19.337
I sold cattle to them

42:19.404 --> 42:21.673
for years.
Oh.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.209
More important,
I know their type.

42:24.275 --> 42:26.778
They are the meanest,
toughest sons of bitches,

42:26.845 --> 42:27.779
and they're proud of it.

42:27.846 --> 42:29.948
But that's nothing new.

42:30.015 --> 42:33.184
My granddad went up
against the meatpackers

42:33.251 --> 42:35.754
in 1919.

42:35.821 --> 42:38.556
Testified in Congress
about their price-fixing.

42:39.891 --> 42:42.994
And after that, none of
'em would buy his cattle.

42:43.061 --> 42:46.732
UMP and all the rest tried
to run him out of the business.

42:46.798 --> 42:49.768
Okay, but that was
a long time ago.
Yeah.

42:49.835 --> 42:53.138
And the big packers
are even worse today.

42:53.204 --> 42:54.606
They're even bigger today.

42:54.673 --> 42:56.274
Really?
And meaner.

42:56.341 --> 42:59.745
Hell, ol' Dwight D. Eisenhower
would've shut 'em down.

42:59.811 --> 43:02.047
He wouldn't have stood
for their crap.

43:03.514 --> 43:06.451
Do you think they
would knowingly sell
us contaminated meat?

43:06.517 --> 43:08.253
Oh, come on.

43:08.319 --> 43:11.823
Workers are getting their arms
cut off over there.

43:11.890 --> 43:13.625
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

43:13.692 --> 43:15.761
No, no, I don't. Please help me.

43:15.827 --> 43:18.664
I... I was at the plant,
it seemed clean to me.

43:18.730 --> 43:20.131
They show you
the kill floor?

43:20.198 --> 43:23.434
I don't know.
I saw a lot of things.

43:23.501 --> 43:25.603
You'd remember.

43:25.671 --> 43:29.107
You see any cattle getting
their heads cut off?

43:29.174 --> 43:31.109
Were you walking
ankle-deep in blood?

43:31.176 --> 43:33.244
(chuckles)

43:33.311 --> 43:34.946
No.

43:35.013 --> 43:38.249
So they didn't show
you a damn thing.

43:38.316 --> 43:40.919
Okay, but how...

43:40.986 --> 43:44.823
how would cow manure
get into the meat?

43:46.391 --> 43:48.694
Rita?

43:48.760 --> 43:51.997
(speaking Spanish)

43:52.063 --> 43:53.699
No, no, thanks,
I'm fine.
You sure?

43:53.765 --> 43:55.867
Yes, thank you.
I'll have some.

43:55.934 --> 43:59.270
Hey, Rita, is your brother
still working over at UMP?

44:04.309 --> 44:05.944
How's he doing?

44:06.011 --> 44:07.746
Oh, he has a good job now.

44:07.813 --> 44:09.614
He's a supervisor in trim.

44:09.681 --> 44:12.818
Mr. Anderson here
would like to know

44:12.884 --> 44:14.619
if the meat over there
is clean.

44:14.686 --> 44:16.587
(laughs)

44:16.654 --> 44:18.957
He wants to know
how cow manure

44:19.024 --> 44:22.427
could ever possibly wind
up in his hamburger.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.863
Well, there's lots of ways.

44:24.930 --> 44:28.366
My brother used to work
at the gut table, and, you know,

44:28.433 --> 44:30.936
they have to pull out
the intestines and the stomachs.

44:31.002 --> 44:34.139
And they just
don't have enough time

44:34.205 --> 44:35.006
to do it right.

44:35.073 --> 44:36.641
The line is moving too fast,

44:36.708 --> 44:39.510
so when they're pulling
the guts out

44:39.577 --> 44:42.113
and they make a mistake,

44:42.180 --> 44:44.249
all the poop and stuff
just pours out

44:44.315 --> 44:45.383
all... all over the meat.

44:45.450 --> 44:48.553
Okay, okay, okay, all right.

44:48.619 --> 44:50.455
But really,
how often does that happen?

44:51.622 --> 44:53.691
Every day.

44:54.760 --> 44:56.494
We got any cookies
back there?

44:56.561 --> 44:58.563
I'll bring a plate
of them.

44:58.629 --> 45:01.800
Anything else
you want to know?

45:01.867 --> 45:05.937
No, no, that's, uh,
plenty, thanks.

45:07.172 --> 45:10.475
This isn't about good people
versus bad people.

45:10.541 --> 45:13.244
It's about the machine
that's taking over this country.

45:13.311 --> 45:15.446
It's like something
out of science fiction.

45:16.782 --> 45:21.787
The land, the cattle,
human beings.

45:22.854 --> 45:25.623
This machine don't give a shit.

45:25.690 --> 45:28.626
Pennies a pound,
pennies a pound.

45:28.693 --> 45:29.861
That's all it cares about.

45:29.928 --> 45:32.063
A few more pennies a pound.

45:33.999 --> 45:36.267
Sounds pretty bleak.

45:36.334 --> 45:37.335
By the way, Don,

45:37.402 --> 45:39.237
you seem like a nice fellow.

45:39.304 --> 45:42.273
But the food your company sells
is crap.

45:42.340 --> 45:44.075
Total crap.

45:44.142 --> 45:46.344
Even when there isn't manure
in it.

45:48.513 --> 45:49.714
(cigarette lighter clicking)

45:49.781 --> 45:51.950
(Spanish hip-hop song plays)

46:07.198 --> 46:10.235
* *

47:12.830 --> 47:14.699
Eh?

47:14.765 --> 47:16.201
Está.

47:22.407 --> 47:23.308
Eh...

47:32.951 --> 47:34.352
Sí.

47:37.422 --> 47:39.624
Bueno...

47:50.268 --> 47:51.369
(squeaks)

47:51.436 --> 47:53.404
(shrieking)

47:54.572 --> 47:55.340
(whimpering)

47:58.143 --> 48:00.078
(shrieking continues)

48:19.998 --> 48:21.399
(whimpers)

48:30.041 --> 48:31.376
Andale.

48:31.442 --> 48:33.278
(laughs)

48:33.344 --> 48:36.581
MAN:
Thank God old Mr.
Nathan come in.

48:36.647 --> 48:39.784
He took one look at me,
he said, "Harry, you are the

48:39.850 --> 48:41.919
"scariest fucking clown
I've ever seen.

48:41.987 --> 48:43.521
Take that off
immediately."

48:43.588 --> 48:45.523
That was that.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.825
I came about that close
to becoming the first Mickey,

48:47.892 --> 48:49.827
which would have
been a disaster

48:49.894 --> 48:51.562
because I'd have probably
killed somebody.

48:54.932 --> 48:55.967
What do you think?

48:56.034 --> 48:57.902
I know it's not Mickey's,

48:57.969 --> 49:01.039
but it's good, right?
Good burger.

49:01.106 --> 49:03.308
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's-it's great.

49:05.543 --> 49:07.979
Harry, what's going on
out at UMP?

49:08.046 --> 49:09.114
Beg pardon?

49:09.180 --> 49:13.118
Yeah, what's really going on
out there with the meat?

49:13.184 --> 49:15.653
You're supposed to
be our conduit
to that place.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.022
They didn't give you the tour?

49:17.088 --> 49:18.789
Yeah, yeah.

49:18.856 --> 49:21.392
Who took you through there?

49:21.459 --> 49:23.428
Uh, Terry.

49:23.494 --> 49:24.762
Oh, boy.

49:24.829 --> 49:26.131
No, no, no,

49:26.197 --> 49:27.865
he was... Listen, he was great.
He was fine.

49:27.932 --> 49:31.836
I just... I've been talking
to a lot of people around town

49:31.902 --> 49:34.339
and I've been hearing some bad
things about that plant.

49:34.405 --> 49:35.773
Kind of things

49:35.840 --> 49:38.376
they don't show you on the tour.

49:38.443 --> 49:40.645
Sounds like they might be
running the production line

49:40.711 --> 49:42.613
too fast, you know?
Hmm.

49:42.680 --> 49:45.050
People are getting hurt
out there every day.

49:45.116 --> 49:47.785
They're getting cut up.

49:47.852 --> 49:49.954
One guy lost his entire arm.

49:50.021 --> 49:52.990
These poor Mexicans,
they come over here

49:53.058 --> 49:54.725
and UMP treats 'em
like shit.

49:54.792 --> 49:57.495
And the meat, I gotta tell you
something, Harry,

49:57.562 --> 49:59.697
the meat is filthy.

49:59.764 --> 50:02.467
Do you know they got
untrained people working

50:02.533 --> 50:03.568
at the gut table?

50:03.634 --> 50:05.703
Really? The gut table?

50:05.770 --> 50:06.771
Yeah. I mean,

50:06.837 --> 50:09.740
Harry, there's shit in our meat.

50:09.807 --> 50:10.608
WOMAN:
Harry!

50:10.675 --> 50:11.709
Hi!

50:11.776 --> 50:12.877
Hey.

50:12.943 --> 50:14.112
I heard
you were here today.

50:14.179 --> 50:15.213
How are you doing, huh?

50:15.280 --> 50:16.447
I can't complain.

50:16.514 --> 50:18.416
Good. Lisa, I want you
to meet Don Anderson.

50:18.483 --> 50:20.118
He just came to the company
from CNN.

50:20.185 --> 50:23.188
Hmm!
ESPN, actually.

50:23.254 --> 50:25.590
Don is the inventor
of the Big One.
Really?

50:25.656 --> 50:27.825
No, my, my team came up
with the name.

50:27.892 --> 50:29.694
You're just being humble.

50:29.760 --> 50:31.129
It's pure genius, Don.

50:31.196 --> 50:32.663
Good name for a burger,
isn't it?

50:32.730 --> 50:33.731
Sure is.

50:33.798 --> 50:34.865
It's very nice
to meet you.

50:34.932 --> 50:37.168
Can I get you
another Fat Tire?

50:37.235 --> 50:38.869
I would love
another Fat Tire.

50:38.936 --> 50:39.837
You want a beer, Don?

50:39.904 --> 50:40.771
No, thanks.

50:40.838 --> 50:42.006
Just one? Just one?

50:42.073 --> 50:43.774
Hey...

50:46.611 --> 50:48.779
Mm!

50:55.720 --> 50:59.224
You know, I think there might
be a little bit of shit

50:59.290 --> 51:01.192
right here in this meat.

51:01.259 --> 51:03.994
Just a teeny little bit.
Microscopic.

51:04.061 --> 51:09.200
Your tests say that the meat
we're getting from UMP is clean.

51:09.267 --> 51:12.503
It's not. I've seen independent
tests that say

51:12.570 --> 51:13.638
that it's not.

51:13.704 --> 51:15.606
There's always been a little
shit in the meat.

51:15.673 --> 51:17.908
You probably been eating it
your whole life.

51:17.975 --> 51:21.479
Yeah. Well, I'd prefer not to,
Harry.

51:21.546 --> 51:24.949
Well, I don't know who
you've been talking to, Don.

51:25.015 --> 51:27.552
But there is absolutely nothing
illegal going on here,

51:27.618 --> 51:29.187
okay?

51:29.254 --> 51:30.588
Meat is supposed to be cooked,

51:30.655 --> 51:34.425
and the grills at Mickey's are
calibrated carefully

51:34.492 --> 51:38.163
to make sure it kills
every little bit

51:38.229 --> 51:39.864
of the bad stuff
that's in there.

51:39.930 --> 51:41.999
Yeah, that might be kinda tough
to explain to our customers.

51:42.066 --> 51:43.168
Explain what?

51:43.234 --> 51:44.402
Listen, there is cow shit
in our meat

51:44.469 --> 51:45.670
because we're running
the line too fast.

51:45.736 --> 51:49.307
Just cook it.
That's all you need to do.

51:49.374 --> 51:52.577
You see, this is one of the
things that's just bugging me

51:52.643 --> 51:53.578
about this country.

51:53.644 --> 51:55.180
Really bugging me.

51:55.246 --> 51:57.648
Americans have become
these, these, these great big

51:57.715 --> 51:59.317
fraidy cats,
afraid of everything.

51:59.384 --> 52:02.953
Everything got to be sterile
and germ-free.

52:03.020 --> 52:04.755
Well, everybody needs
to grow up!

52:04.822 --> 52:06.991
That's what they need.

52:07.057 --> 52:09.026
You want to be safe, huh?

52:09.093 --> 52:10.828
Perfectly safe?

52:10.895 --> 52:11.896
Well, forget about it.

52:11.962 --> 52:13.731
That's not gonna happen, okay?

52:13.798 --> 52:15.733
Everybody just needs to get
that through their heads.

52:15.800 --> 52:19.504
Just cook the meat
and you'll be fine.

52:19.570 --> 52:22.540
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

52:22.607 --> 52:24.675
I mean, you've known
all about this?

52:24.742 --> 52:27.212
I'm shocked.

52:30.415 --> 52:32.417
Donny boy, you just
got to try and
step back

52:32.483 --> 52:33.851
and look at
the big picture.

52:33.918 --> 52:37.888
40,000 people die in automobile
accidents every year.

52:37.955 --> 52:40.325
Does that mean Detroit should
stop making cars?

52:40.391 --> 52:44.128
Does it?
Of course not.

52:44.195 --> 52:45.930
(sighs)

52:45.996 --> 52:48.032
You ever been down to Mexico?

52:48.098 --> 52:49.133
What's that have
to do with anything?

52:49.200 --> 52:50.268
It's beautiful
down there.

52:50.335 --> 52:53.638
Really beautiful,
great beaches, gorgeous,

52:53.704 --> 52:56.207
but poor, poor...

52:56.274 --> 52:59.310
poorest fucking place
I've ever been, I think.

52:59.377 --> 53:04.615
Guy down there makes
three, maybe four dollars a day.

53:04.682 --> 53:05.716
A day, Don.

53:05.783 --> 53:07.585
Now, that same guy,

53:07.652 --> 53:11.289
he comes up here,
he gets a job working for UMP

53:11.356 --> 53:13.524
making ten dollars an hour.

53:13.591 --> 53:16.261
That's more money in one day
than he makes back home

53:16.327 --> 53:19.029
in a whole month.

53:19.096 --> 53:21.799
So, frankly, I don't see
the problem.

53:21.866 --> 53:25.703
What he's making, these people
come up here, right?

53:25.770 --> 53:28.606
Nobody's telling 'em
to come work for UMP.

53:28.673 --> 53:30.040
Okay, okay,
but that's not the point.

53:30.107 --> 53:31.041
And you know what?

53:31.108 --> 53:33.010
I admire these people, okay?

53:33.077 --> 53:34.178
I really do.

53:34.245 --> 53:35.413
They're hard workers.

53:35.480 --> 53:37.348
They're working hard

53:37.415 --> 53:39.517
and they're trying to improve
their lives, okay?

53:39.584 --> 53:41.552
Now, isn't that what
our ancestors did?

53:41.619 --> 53:42.853
Isn't that what made
this country

53:42.920 --> 53:46.190
the great country
that it is today, huh?

53:46.257 --> 53:48.092
And you want to try
and stop 'em?

53:48.158 --> 53:51.095
You want to tell 'em that
you know what's best for 'em?

53:51.161 --> 53:54.499
Most people don't like to be
told what's best for 'em.

53:54.565 --> 53:57.668
Well, what's going on
at UMP's unacceptable,

53:57.735 --> 54:01.138
and I'm gonna have to tell
Jack about all this.

54:01.205 --> 54:03.140
(chuckles)

54:03.207 --> 54:06.711
Oh, gonna tell Jack, huh?

54:12.917 --> 54:17.021
I've been working
for this company
almost 30 years.

54:17.087 --> 54:19.524
Hell, I grew up right down
the street from the Nathan's

54:19.590 --> 54:21.559
when we were all back in Muncie.

54:21.626 --> 54:25.430
So here's my little piece
of friendly advice

54:25.496 --> 54:27.164
to you, Donny boy.

54:27.231 --> 54:31.836
I'd be careful how close
I got to Jack.

54:31.902 --> 54:35.373
See, your boy Jack is about
this close to getting his tit

54:35.440 --> 54:37.241
caught in the wringer.

54:37.308 --> 54:38.743
He's under investigation,

54:38.809 --> 54:40.311
okay?

54:40.378 --> 54:41.479
Cooking the books,

54:41.546 --> 54:43.648
padding his expense account.

54:43.714 --> 54:47.184
Not to mention boning
his own secretary, okay,

54:47.251 --> 54:49.053
and that is not the kind
of company

54:49.119 --> 54:50.755
that we want to run.
Louise?

54:50.821 --> 54:52.390
That's right.

54:52.457 --> 54:54.759
Your buddy Jack's got two,

54:54.825 --> 54:57.027
maybe three months
before he's out
the door.

54:57.094 --> 54:58.062
Could be sooner.

54:58.128 --> 54:59.964
He's sleeping with Louise?

55:00.030 --> 55:01.532
And you know what, Don?

55:01.599 --> 55:02.833
You should be thanking me,

55:02.900 --> 55:04.669
instead of doing all this
complaining.

55:04.735 --> 55:06.971
I negotiated
a hell of a good price

55:07.037 --> 55:08.005
with UMP, okay?

55:08.072 --> 55:12.109
I negotiated a great price
for your fuckin' meat.

55:12.176 --> 55:13.411
Hell, if it weren't for me,

55:13.478 --> 55:16.146
there wouldn't be
no Big One, Don.

55:16.213 --> 55:19.183
I'd like to see you go and find
a supplier that will sell you

55:19.249 --> 55:20.951
grade-A chuck
at 40 cents a pound.

55:21.018 --> 55:21.919
I'd like to see that.

55:24.188 --> 55:26.791
H-Have you ever met Louise?

55:26.857 --> 55:29.126
Have I ever met her?

55:29.193 --> 55:32.162
20 years ago
I gave her that job.

55:32.229 --> 55:33.197
She was a good-looking woman

55:33.263 --> 55:35.766
back then, too.
(sighs)

55:38.869 --> 55:42.507
It is a sad fact
of life, Don,

55:42.573 --> 55:46.343
but the truth is we all have
to eat a little shit

55:46.411 --> 55:48.012
from time to time.

55:48.078 --> 55:50.381
But just for the record,
I want you to know

55:50.448 --> 55:51.882
I'm with you on this, okay?

55:51.949 --> 55:53.183
I really am.

55:53.250 --> 55:54.385
I'm gonna go down there.

55:54.452 --> 55:55.786
I'm gonna see what the hell's
going on.

55:55.853 --> 55:57.822
If I have to, I'm gonna
kick some ass.

55:59.424 --> 56:02.860
You know what, Harry?

56:02.927 --> 56:06.897
I don't think that's gonna
be good enough.

56:06.964 --> 56:10.535
You seem like
a real bright guy, Don.

56:10.601 --> 56:12.603
Hate to see you get caught up
in something

56:12.670 --> 56:14.071
you couldn't get out of.

56:14.138 --> 56:17.442
Give it some thought.

56:20.210 --> 56:22.980
Why don't you take some
of these fries home with you?

56:23.047 --> 56:24.449
I'm not gonna finish 'em.

56:26.951 --> 56:29.587
(sighs)

56:32.156 --> 56:33.424
No.

56:33.491 --> 56:36.226
No, it's not that simple.

56:36.293 --> 56:38.328
There is something
definitely weird

56:38.395 --> 56:40.297
going on between Jack and Harry,

56:40.364 --> 56:42.800
and either way
I can lose this job.

56:42.867 --> 56:44.935
Either way.

56:46.070 --> 56:47.438
(sighs)

56:47.505 --> 56:50.708
No. No, we're not gonna
move again-- that's...

56:50.775 --> 56:53.110
that's not gonna happen.

56:54.344 --> 56:56.914
Well, just tell Jay
to wait a moment.

56:56.981 --> 56:58.516
This is important.

56:58.583 --> 57:00.751
Well, have him wait!

57:02.820 --> 57:04.154
(sighs)

57:05.122 --> 57:07.357
Yeah.

57:07.424 --> 57:10.595
I'll... I'll talk to you later.

57:34.919 --> 57:37.588
No, no. Look, Jack,
it's going great.

57:37.655 --> 57:40.090
I, uh...
I've been out to the plant,

57:40.157 --> 57:41.325
I spoke to some workers.

57:41.391 --> 57:44.995
I-I even tracked down this...
this old rancher who's...

57:45.062 --> 57:47.765
dealt with these guys
for years, so...

57:47.832 --> 57:50.134
There's a lot of things, but...

57:50.200 --> 57:52.970
Yeah, yeah, no,
of course I met with Harry.

57:53.037 --> 57:54.905
Yeah, he's-he's a...

57:54.972 --> 57:56.807
interesting guy--
you were right.

57:56.874 --> 57:59.944
But I-I don't think that he's...

58:00.010 --> 58:02.279
a crook.

58:02.346 --> 58:04.815
Well, I don't know.

58:07.017 --> 58:09.219
All right.

58:09.286 --> 58:12.289
Then, uh...

58:12.356 --> 58:16.026
I would probably recommend
we do...

58:16.093 --> 58:20.330
some additional testing
in the near future...

58:20.397 --> 58:22.733
see what that shows.

58:28.005 --> 58:29.607
Yeah.

58:31.008 --> 58:33.043
Will you be keeping this
on your American Express?

58:33.110 --> 58:35.179
Sure.
I have

58:35.245 --> 58:37.414
three pay-per-view movies
at $7.95 each.
Uh-huh.

58:37.481 --> 58:41.351
Would you like to join
our Executive Guest
Advantage Program?
No.

58:41.418 --> 58:43.253
Did you enjoy
your stay with us?

58:43.320 --> 58:47.424
Not really.
Were you here
on business or pleasure?

58:47.491 --> 58:48.826
Business.

58:48.893 --> 58:50.928
Is there anything
we can do in the future

58:50.995 --> 58:52.763
to make your stay with us
more enjoyable?

58:52.830 --> 58:55.132
You can give me my bill.

58:56.734 --> 58:59.604
Bye-bye, Mr. Anderson.
Have a great day.

59:14.118 --> 59:17.622
* *

59:38.175 --> 59:41.111
(indistinct chatter)

59:41.178 --> 59:43.280
Thanks a lot.

59:43.347 --> 59:44.682
Hi.

59:44.749 --> 59:46.583
Have you guys decided
on anything?

59:46.651 --> 59:50.454
Uh, two Chinese
chicken salad, please,

59:50.520 --> 59:53.490
y two Coca-Colas, please.

59:53.557 --> 59:54.759
Anything to start?

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:03.834
Okay. Uh, I'll be right back
with those... Cokes.

01:00:03.901 --> 01:00:05.069
Oh.

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:07.772
Thanks.

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.345
Ah.

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:17.507
(typing)

01:01:17.574 --> 01:01:19.143
(footsteps approaching)

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:20.477
Hey.

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:22.312
How was Roger?

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:24.815
* Roger is the
boringest person *

01:01:24.882 --> 01:01:27.151
(both laughing)
* I have ever met... *

01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:29.186
Ooh, sorry.

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:31.555
What are you up to?

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:34.591
Um, I'm writing
a biology paper.

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:36.593
Oh, what's it about?

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:39.463
History of genetics.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.099
Mendel, that sort of thing.

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:43.433
When's it due?

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.735
Tuesday.

01:01:44.802 --> 01:01:46.403
Next week.

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:50.407
Yeah. I just have a bunch
of stuff due before then.

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:52.777
Where did you come from?

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:54.411
I was never this good,

01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:56.847
and your father, he was

01:01:56.914 --> 01:01:58.482
a lazy asshole.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.217
Mom!

01:02:00.284 --> 01:02:02.987
What? He had other people
write his papers for him.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:06.223
Mm. I bet you were
one of them. Hmm.

01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:09.326
Screw you.
Hey!

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.261
(laughter)

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:12.262
(happy sigh)

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:15.933
We got a new shipment
of puppies today.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.268
I want to take
them all home.

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:20.771
Don't. Mom...

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:22.606
Well, it's sad--
Loretta said that they just

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:24.541
make those cages big enough
to be legal

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:28.445
but small enough
so people will get
the puppies out of there.

01:02:28.512 --> 01:02:29.980
When I left the store tonight,

01:02:30.047 --> 01:02:32.116
I just wanted to open
all those cages

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:35.052
and let all those little puppies
run free!

01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:36.386
Mom...

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:37.855
They are so cute.

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:40.024
Mom, I'm trying to work.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.258
Okay.

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:43.760
But you have to come
and see them tomorrow.

01:02:43.828 --> 01:02:45.963
(typing)

01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:48.933
(laughing)

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:53.170
(laughing):
Too slow, Amber, too slow.

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:55.139
Take it easy!

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:56.740
Go to bed!

01:02:56.807 --> 01:02:58.976
Mm!

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.614
(laughing)

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:07.384
(laughing, panting)

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:22.032
(laughing)

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:28.906
(children speaking Spanish)

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:35.445
COCO:

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:36.546
SYLVIA:

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.622
Hola. Hey.

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:54.158
It's me.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.625
Mm...

01:04:57.761 --> 01:05:00.330
Call me, ¿sí?

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:02.132
(sniffles)

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:07.471
...having a problem...

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:10.640
Uncle Pete! Hi!
Hey!

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:12.076
Hey!
Oh, God!

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:14.778
What is with
these uniforms?
Sorry, Pete.

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:16.080
We have jobs.

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:18.282
No, no, somebody put a blanket
on her, okay? All right?

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:19.783
I cannot believe
my beautiful Amber

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.218
is in a damn
Mickey's uniform.

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:22.953
No, I can't
look at you

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.488
in that thing.
Sorry, Pete,
that's what you wear

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:26.256
when you have
a real job.
You smell like chicken nuggets.

01:05:26.323 --> 01:05:27.324
(gasps)
Okay? You do.

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:29.093
She has a job!
Yeah, well...

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:30.995
Give me a break!
All right,
all right, well,

01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:32.596
except for the uniform--
let's see...

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:33.463
You're dumb.

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:35.799
You look great.

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:37.201
You do-- you
look fantastic.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.336
Thank you.
It's great to see you.

01:05:39.403 --> 01:05:40.470
Good to see you.

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:42.339
All right.
How long are you
here for?

01:05:42.406 --> 01:05:45.142
Oh, just for the night--
I'm on my way up to Bozeman.

01:05:45.209 --> 01:05:48.212
No, don't... I don't think
I can talk to you in that thing.

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:49.646
I really d...
Leave her alone!

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:50.780
Honey, you got
some homework?

01:05:50.847 --> 01:05:52.316
Oh, not much.
Okay, why don't you

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:54.184
get it done, change your clothes
and go out with Uncle Pete?

01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:55.719
'Cause I have a date
I can't break.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:56.987
Had I known you
were coming...

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:57.988
What, you would've changed
your plans?

01:05:58.055 --> 01:06:00.290
Mm, no.
Mm-hmm.

01:06:00.357 --> 01:06:02.026
How's Gabe?
He's great.

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:03.727
He's walking and talking.

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:05.662
Hey, how's Michelle?

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:07.864
Mm...

01:06:07.931 --> 01:06:09.399
Is that Mrs. Whiskers?

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:10.367
(laughing)

01:06:10.434 --> 01:06:13.037
Check him out, check him out.

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:14.671
Oh, he's so big.

01:06:14.738 --> 01:06:16.440
Right?

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:17.474
Here.

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:18.608
No, hey!
Oh!

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:20.610
(rock music playing)

01:06:22.612 --> 01:06:25.582
(indistinct voices)

01:06:27.784 --> 01:06:30.254
Man, this place is great.
Mmm...

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.057
Yeah. You are only allowed
to come here with me.

01:06:33.123 --> 01:06:35.192
So, are you on the pill?

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:37.861
Um, no.

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:39.796
No? All right.
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:06:39.863 --> 01:06:41.365
Not really.

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:43.500
I'm kind of in between.
Mm-hmm.

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:45.135
Well, they are circling
you like sharks.

01:06:45.202 --> 01:06:47.204
All right, I don't want
to come back here

01:06:47.271 --> 01:06:49.306
and find that you got, like,
a little baby fry cook

01:06:49.373 --> 01:06:51.308
in the oven.
(groans):
You know what?

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:53.577
What?
I remember you taking me
to Mickey's when

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:54.744
I was a kid.
No.

01:06:54.811 --> 01:06:56.880
Yes.
Did I? All right,
I was just being lazy.

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:59.516
I apologize, all right?
Now I hate everything
about the place.

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:03.287
Mom said it was a big deal
when the first Mickey's
opened here.

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:04.854
(sarcastically):
Oh, it was tremendous!

01:07:04.921 --> 01:07:07.124
Nah, it was--
I mean, you know...

01:07:07.191 --> 01:07:09.526
Cody was on the map.

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:11.128
The-the-the first one
didn't bother me.

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:15.232
It was just the 400th
that started to, you
know, get under my skin.

01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:17.634
Well, I need the money.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:18.535
Do you?
I really do.

01:07:18.602 --> 01:07:20.737
Hmm, there's no
other jobs, right?

01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:23.140
You tried ASPCA?
You tried the Park Services?

01:07:23.207 --> 01:07:24.641
You tried day care, right?

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:27.511
Nobody around here needs their
kids to be taken care of?

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:28.612
(sighs)

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:30.614
It was the first
job I could find.
Uh-huh.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.949
I mean, a friend
of mine worked there.

01:07:33.016 --> 01:07:34.651
What do you want to hear?

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:35.985
I'm not
criticizing you.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:38.755
All right?
I think you are great.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:41.691
I just want to know
your timeline for
getting out of here.

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:43.793
I want to go to college.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.095
Good.

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:46.863
I'm thinking Oregon

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:48.098
or Montana.

01:07:48.165 --> 01:07:49.866
Hmm, what you gonna study?

01:07:49.933 --> 01:07:52.236
I don't know.
I want to...

01:07:52.302 --> 01:07:53.837
I want to write.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.139
I like photography.

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:57.307
But I think

01:07:57.374 --> 01:08:00.877
I want to study science and...
aeronautical engineering.

01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:03.347
Aeronautical
engineering?
Yeah.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:05.849
I mean, if I could do
anything in the world,

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.452
I'd be an astronaut.

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:10.920
All right, well,
fucking-A do it.

01:08:10.987 --> 01:08:12.122
Okay.
Okay, but you need

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:13.823
to get out of here
to do that.

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:17.093
Was it hard leaving Cody
back when you were a teenager?

01:08:17.161 --> 01:08:18.395
No. Not for me.

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:21.131
Your mom, though,
that was a different story.

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:22.566
I was on the way.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:23.933
That cuts down
on your options.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.772
Mm-hmm, that is why, if by the
age of 21, you have not

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:31.408
missed one
menstrual cycle,

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:34.243
I will give you $1,000.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.613
Will you shut up? Okay?

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.483
I am not talking
to my uncle about sex.

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:43.252
Okay. I read this study
the other day about, uh...

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.589
people who are happiest
with their lives.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:48.091
And the ones who have followed
their passion, right--

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:49.658
even if they weren't, you know,

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.495
technically successful,
all right--

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.129
when they were looking
back at their life,

01:08:53.197 --> 01:08:54.863
they had fewer regrets.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:57.201
You know, they felt
their life had
been more fulfilling.

01:08:57.267 --> 01:09:00.670
Yeah. That makes sense,
I guess.

01:09:00.737 --> 01:09:01.970
Yeah, it does.

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:04.140
So bottom line is
do not listen to me.

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:05.709
Do not listen
to your mother.

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:07.877
Listen to yourself.

01:09:07.944 --> 01:09:10.514
I mean, if you want
to be like everybody else,

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.616
just do what everybody's
telling you to do.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.420
And what about you?

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:19.856
Are you doing what
you always wanted to do?

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:24.528
Well, if I jump back
to when I was your age,

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:28.265
no, I don't think
I would be wildly
impressed.

01:09:28.332 --> 01:09:29.899
All right? I don't. I...

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:34.703
But, you know,
I'm all right
with what I'm doing.

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.941
And, you know,
I'm really all right
with what I'm not doing.

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:42.446
Is that your move?

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:43.513
Yeah.

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:44.648
Fuh-bop!

01:09:44.714 --> 01:09:45.682
Dang it.

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:46.950
Yeah. So...

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:49.018
Hello.

01:09:49.085 --> 01:09:51.154
Amber, why are you still up?

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.223
Well, why do you
have my poncho on?

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:54.324
It's fine.

01:09:54.391 --> 01:09:55.659
How was it, hmm?

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:57.026
(sighs)

01:09:57.093 --> 01:09:59.463
Well, she's home fairly early,
if that signifies anything.

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:01.097
Oh, no, no, no.
It doesn't mean anything.

01:10:01.164 --> 01:10:02.098
Your mother...

01:10:02.165 --> 01:10:03.500
She's amazing.

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:05.001
You wouldn't believe what she
could get accomplished

01:10:05.068 --> 01:10:06.436
in a short period of time.

01:10:06.503 --> 01:10:07.637
She's...
Screw you both.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:08.338
(gasps)

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:10.274
Hey, Sis. Sis?

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.308
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:13.243
So what would you say?

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:15.412
Is Cody
a better town today,

01:10:15.479 --> 01:10:16.713
or back when we were kids?

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:18.748
Well, I know what
you would say.

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:19.716
What?

01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:21.117
Your uncle hates
everything, Amber.

01:10:21.184 --> 01:10:23.420
You know, I actually
think it's better now.

01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:24.621
There's more
stuff to do.

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:26.390
Oh, yeah. There's more to do.

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:28.958
You got Wal-Mart, the Kmart,
and the Target, right?

01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:31.227
I mean, you got Chuck E. Cheese,
you got Taco Bell, you got

01:10:31.295 --> 01:10:33.029
Arby's, you got

01:10:33.096 --> 01:10:34.364
Mickey's, you got Denny's,

01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:36.566
you've got, uh,
Chili's, you

01:10:36.633 --> 01:10:38.234
got Applebee's,
you got Wendy's,

01:10:38.302 --> 01:10:39.836
you got Hardee's. Right? You got

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:40.904
the KFC,

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.639
the IHOP.
(screams)

01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:44.674
Do they still have
that Der Weinerschnitzel?

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:45.642
Oh, yeah.

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:47.711
Oh, thank God it's still hanging
in there! You know?

01:10:47.777 --> 01:10:50.647
I mean, I don't know about you
guys, but I could just piss away

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:52.316
a whole Sunday afternoon
at the Sunglass Hut.

01:10:52.382 --> 01:10:54.518
You know, spend the whole...
Oh! Have you ever been
to the Sunglass Hut?

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:56.386
No. I never have.
I'm not trying to come off

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:57.887
like some Polly Perfect
here, all right?

01:10:57.954 --> 01:10:59.623
I mean,
I'm going to make some cabinets

01:10:59.689 --> 01:11:02.125
for some rich New York
investment banker fuck

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:05.094
who probably spends two weeks
a year at his Montana ranch,

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:06.696
so don't listen to me.

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:09.065
Oh, I'm not.
I'm not talking to you.

01:11:09.132 --> 01:11:11.501
I'm talking to your
daughter, and I'm
probably just going through

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:13.136
some full-of-shit,
early-middle-age period.

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:15.405
I don't think
you're full of shit.

01:11:15.472 --> 01:11:17.341
Thank you.
Thank you.
She's so nice.

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:18.875
What happened to you?

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:19.943
No, no, no, sweetheart.

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:21.077
Don't contradict
your mother.

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:22.379
He is full of shit.
Uh-huh.

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:23.613
Look, I don't
waste a lot of time

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.214
thinking about this stuff.
Oh...

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:27.283
Democrats, Republicans--

01:11:27.351 --> 01:11:28.618
they're all crooks.

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:30.587
This is why revolutions
are meant for the young.

01:11:30.654 --> 01:11:32.656
If you don't do it now,
you're never gonna.

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:35.325
Uniform, uniformity.
Conform, conformity.

01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:37.527
Monogamy, monotony.

01:11:37.594 --> 01:11:39.429
No wonder you're
not still married.

01:11:39.496 --> 01:11:40.997
Hey.
Stupid, stupidity.

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:43.333
Yeah, look. Hey, the facts
are not always friendly.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.968
Listen to who's giving
the lecture here, Amber.

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:47.337
Your uncle
did not finish college.

01:11:47.404 --> 01:11:49.105
Jesus!
Okay!

01:11:49.172 --> 01:11:50.807
Oh!

01:11:50.874 --> 01:11:52.342
He lived in a camper

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:53.777
for 18 months.

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:54.911
An Airstream!

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:56.613
This is not a role model.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.948
Remind me to deprogram you
after he leaves.

01:11:59.015 --> 01:12:01.351
Hey, Mom said you got
kicked out of college.

01:12:01.418 --> 01:12:02.752
Oh, well, thanks, Mom.

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:05.589
Yeah. Your mug shots
were in all the papers!

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:07.323
Yeah, with eight
others, all right?

01:12:07.391 --> 01:12:08.825
I was at Colorado
University, right?

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:09.993
We were the CU Nine.

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:11.928
Yeah, that notorious band

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:14.631
of Midwestern white
freedom fighters!
Don't...

01:12:14.698 --> 01:12:16.666
Look. No, no, no, no, no.
We took over

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:18.602
the chancellor's office,
all right? We were protesting

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.904
the college's investment
in South Africa.

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:22.305
So what happened?

01:12:22.372 --> 01:12:24.040
All right. Well,
so after about four hours,

01:12:24.107 --> 01:12:25.675
they come bursting through this
barricade that we built...

01:12:25.742 --> 01:12:27.110
Okay, that was
two chalkboards.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:29.278
It's not two chalkboards,
all right?
It was, too!

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.847
We had a bunch of rope
with some chairs...

01:12:30.914 --> 01:12:32.916
Look, they practically
beat the shit out
of all of us, all right?

01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:34.384
They treated us
like a band of terrorists.

01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:35.985
You got your
little ass kicked
out of college,

01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:37.787
which he
never finished...
Big deal.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.156
And it cost our dad $2,000
in legal fees.

01:12:40.223 --> 01:12:41.224
Which I eventually
paid him back.

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:42.826
Anyway, meanwhile,
cut to...

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:45.361
About a year later,
the college divests

01:12:45.429 --> 01:12:47.196
all its holdings
in South Africa

01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:49.533
and a little while after that,
Nelson Mandela is a free man.

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:52.569
All because
of the CU Nine... Nine... Nine!

01:12:52.636 --> 01:12:53.937
No, nobody said that.
Nobody even thought that.

01:12:54.003 --> 01:12:56.940
All right? The point is that,
you know,

01:12:57.006 --> 01:12:58.508
if enough people
start thinking about something,

01:12:58.575 --> 01:13:00.410
and trying to actually
do something,

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:02.378
you can change things
for the better.

01:13:02.446 --> 01:13:04.914
I believe that.

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:06.916
Well, I hope
they can change
for the better.

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:08.985
No, don't just hope.
You know, you can't
just sit back and hope.

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:10.019
You have to do something.

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:12.522
In a town like this,
hope will kill you.

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:14.624
It's your move.

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:22.766
(speaking Spanish)

01:14:29.866 --> 01:14:30.934
Ah...

01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:24.888
Hey, hey, hey!
You fucking crazy? Huh?

01:15:43.006 --> 01:15:45.074
Everybody else,
stop fucking smiling,

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:46.309
and get back to work!

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:51.881
Coco...

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:11.635
(Coco moaning)

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.072
Coco?

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:17.306
Coco?

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:29.018
She okay?

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:30.253
She needs

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:32.188
to start sleeping at night.

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:33.690
So do you.

01:16:33.757 --> 01:16:35.124
How's Stan's
back doing?

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:37.961
He complains about
it all the time,

01:16:38.027 --> 01:16:39.395
but he's fine.

01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:40.797
Well, say
hello for me.

01:16:40.864 --> 01:16:42.065
As for this
little lady,

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:44.167
she's got about an hour or
so left on her shift,

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:46.535
so...
She'll make it.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:49.338
All right. Let's go.

01:16:49.405 --> 01:16:50.774
Andale.

01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:56.946
You've been a bad girl.

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:09.192
Chill out, okay?

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:16.332
Touch her again,
and I'll kill you. Hmm?

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:17.400
I mean it.

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.274
(Coco snorting)

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:04.313
Think about it.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.850
All that surveillance
equipment they have here?

01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:09.518
They say it's
for our safety.

01:18:09.585 --> 01:18:11.187
But those cameras are

01:18:11.254 --> 01:18:12.521
pointed right at us.

01:18:12.588 --> 01:18:14.223
Monitoring us.

01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:17.460
Making sure we don't
steal shit and stuff.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.796
Yeah, you know, I always wonder

01:18:19.863 --> 01:18:21.931
whose job it is
to watch those monitors.

01:18:21.998 --> 01:18:23.933
'Cause you don't see anyone
around here doing that.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.469
I think they just
record everything,

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.204
in case something happens.

01:18:28.271 --> 01:18:31.174
It's probably all
getting fed back

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.909
to the national
headquarters.

01:18:32.976 --> 01:18:36.445
Yeah, like our cash registers.

01:18:36.512 --> 01:18:39.648
What about them?

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.350
You don't know about that?

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:42.786
Uh-uh.

01:18:42.852 --> 01:18:44.888
Oh, man. Okay.

01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:47.423
First thing I do
whenever I start my shift

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:50.359
is type in the last four digits
of my social security number

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:51.795
then log in.
Mm-hmm.

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:55.498
From then on, they keep track
of every keystroke.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:56.866
Really?

01:18:56.933 --> 01:18:58.768
Yeah. They keep
a record.

01:18:58.835 --> 01:19:00.636
They know exactly
how many orders of fries

01:19:00.703 --> 01:19:02.705
I've sold this month,
everything.

01:19:02.772 --> 01:19:04.173
And I even have to put in

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.042
a little code
with each person's order

01:19:06.109 --> 01:19:08.444
saying their approximate age
and ethnicity.

01:19:08.511 --> 01:19:09.512
(laughing)

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:10.613
They don't even know.

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:12.515
You know, that is fucking evil.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:16.519
Well...

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.221
that's Mickey's
for you.

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:24.928
(rock music playing)

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:27.997
(indistinct voices)

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:35.571
Man... when we came here, we
sat right over there.

01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:36.873
Was it, like, full?

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:39.042
Yeah, it was
really full.

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:40.409
There was this
band that played.

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:42.445
Pretty good.
Yeah, hey,
look, just ask.

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:44.047
Mm-hmm.
Don't worry.

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.214
All right.
Casual.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:46.149
Got it.

01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:47.783
Nothing...

01:19:47.851 --> 01:19:49.785
Hi.
Hi.

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.488
Were you here
the other night?

01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:53.689
Yeah.

01:19:53.756 --> 01:19:55.424
Who was that guy
that was with you?

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:56.425
Uh, my uncle?

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:57.426
Oh, my God.

01:19:57.493 --> 01:19:58.962
(laughter)

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:01.497
We were trying to
figure that one out.

01:20:01.564 --> 01:20:03.266
He's hot, okay?
Oh.

01:20:03.332 --> 01:20:04.433
(laughter)

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.902
No, he's my uncle.

01:20:05.969 --> 01:20:08.304
I'm Andrew,
this is Alice.

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:09.138
I'm Amber.
Kim.

01:20:09.205 --> 01:20:10.706
Andrew. Kim?
Nice to meet you.

01:20:10.773 --> 01:20:12.241
You, too.
Hey.

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:14.577
Well, um, we're all heading
over to The Lookout for a party,

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:15.611
if you guys want to come.

01:20:15.678 --> 01:20:16.779
The Lookout?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

01:20:16.846 --> 01:20:18.214
You know that
road behind campus.

01:20:18.281 --> 01:20:20.083
You just take that up Mount
Cody for, like, a mile.

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:21.317
It's right there.
You know?

01:20:21.384 --> 01:20:21.951
Oh! Right, yeah.

01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:23.352
Should be fun.

01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:24.888
All right, maybe
we'll see you then.

01:20:24.954 --> 01:20:25.889
Yeah.
Make it out there?

01:20:25.955 --> 01:20:27.356
Okay. See you there.
All right.

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:30.326
(rock music blaring)

01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:33.296
(indistinct voices)

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:39.002
'Cause there is no way
you can make sense of
it all on your own.

01:20:39.068 --> 01:20:42.138
The lies are too big,
they're too ingenious,

01:20:42.205 --> 01:20:44.273
they're too interconnected
with one another,

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.942
and they know if the
lies are repeated

01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:48.511
over and over
and over again,

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:50.579
people are finally
gonna have to believe it.

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:51.580
And we do!

01:20:51.647 --> 01:20:53.149
Yeah.

01:20:53.216 --> 01:20:55.051
Like, have you guys read that
book Crimes Against Nature?

01:20:55.118 --> 01:20:56.619
ANDREW:
Title says it all.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:57.520
ALICE:
Exactly.

01:20:57.586 --> 01:20:58.687
Read that book.

01:20:58.754 --> 01:20:59.822
It's talking about how,
right now,

01:20:59.889 --> 01:21:01.257
they've got
the logging companies

01:21:01.324 --> 01:21:03.092
and the timber companies
chopping down all the trees

01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:04.560
in the national forests,

01:21:04.627 --> 01:21:06.996
but they're saying it's the
"healthy forest" program.

01:21:07.063 --> 01:21:09.165
Yep. And they got
the coal companies

01:21:09.232 --> 01:21:10.633
running our
"clean air" plan.

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.235
ALICE:
I mean,

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:14.870
how do they announce that stuff
in public without cracking up?

01:21:14.938 --> 01:21:16.439
I gotta hand it
to them, though--

01:21:16.505 --> 01:21:18.307
genius fuckin' marketers.

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:20.676
And they're extremely
well-organized,

01:21:20.743 --> 01:21:21.810
so we need to be, too.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.146
KIM:
Amber!

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:24.513
ALICE:
Yeah, and these guys
see themselves

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:26.315
Come here!
as big-time
righteous Christians.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:28.217
ANDREW:
Well, what would
Jesus do?

01:21:28.284 --> 01:21:29.352
Hey.

01:21:29.418 --> 01:21:30.186
What's going on?

01:21:30.253 --> 01:21:31.654
I met these really cute guys.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.888
They want to meet you.

01:21:32.956 --> 01:21:35.358
Well... (sighs)

01:21:35.424 --> 01:21:36.725
I'm hanging out
with these guys.

01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:39.395
They're so boring.

01:21:39.462 --> 01:21:41.630
I don't want to
leave just yet.

01:21:41.697 --> 01:21:43.499
Why?

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:45.834
I don't know.

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:46.902
Don't worry about it.

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:48.237
I'll catch up
with you later.

01:22:02.451 --> 01:22:03.852
Hey, Brian.
Hey.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:05.521
What are you
doing here?

01:22:08.157 --> 01:22:10.293
(knocking)
Tony?

01:22:10.359 --> 01:22:11.627
Hey, Amber.

01:22:11.694 --> 01:22:14.363
Uh... Tony...

01:22:15.698 --> 01:22:17.133
Yeah?

01:22:19.235 --> 01:22:21.004
I don't think I can
work here anymore.

01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:23.006
Is everything okay?

01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:24.473
Are you okay?

01:22:26.642 --> 01:22:27.943
I'm fine.

01:22:28.011 --> 01:22:29.745
What do you want to do?

01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:31.547
You want to cut back
on the hours?

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:33.282
Maybe try another shift?

01:22:33.349 --> 01:22:36.852
No.

01:22:36.919 --> 01:22:38.021
Did something happen?

01:22:38.087 --> 01:22:39.455
Anybody giving you
a hard time?

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:42.825
No.

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:43.959
What's up?

01:22:44.027 --> 01:22:46.495
Talk to me.

01:22:46.562 --> 01:22:50.599
I just... I can't
work here anymore.

01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:52.068
It feels wrong.

01:22:52.135 --> 01:22:53.636
BRIAN:
How is it wrong?

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:55.704
The job sucks, but that
doesn't mean it's wrong.

01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:57.040
Brian...

01:22:59.608 --> 01:23:03.346
Listen, Amber, you're one of
my best associates, okay?

01:23:03.412 --> 01:23:05.648
We're starting to talk
about you--

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:06.615
management material.

01:23:06.682 --> 01:23:09.818
Okay? You're about
to turn 18 pretty soon.

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:12.188
We're expanding. We got a
lot of opportunities here.

01:23:12.255 --> 01:23:13.456
Look, think about this.

01:23:15.858 --> 01:23:17.626
I just want to do
something else.

01:23:20.696 --> 01:23:21.797
Okay. I mean,

01:23:21.864 --> 01:23:23.199
is something wrong
with this place?

01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:27.770
It kind of doesn't
feel real.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.573
I mean... it's
not your fault.

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:33.476
It's just, this place is like
a thousand other places.

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:36.011
I mean, they're all...
it's identical.
Right.

01:23:36.079 --> 01:23:37.646
Okay, Amber, you want
reality, you got it.

01:23:37.713 --> 01:23:39.082
Good-bye.

01:23:39.148 --> 01:23:42.951
Tony, I'm sorry; this has
nothing to do with you.

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:45.488
I'm really
disappointed, Amber.

01:23:45.554 --> 01:23:47.022
Really disappointed.

01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:48.657
Me, too.

01:23:50.226 --> 01:23:52.728
I'm... sorry.

01:23:52.795 --> 01:23:55.998
TONY:
You can pick up your
check next Thursday.

01:23:56.065 --> 01:23:59.368
You want a coffee
freezer for the road?

01:23:59.435 --> 01:24:00.636
Okay.

01:24:16.752 --> 01:24:17.853
(loud clank)

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.389
Oh... Oh! Oh!

01:24:20.456 --> 01:24:22.658
(screaming)

01:24:23.926 --> 01:24:25.661
Francisco!

01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:29.565
¡Corta la corriente!

01:24:29.632 --> 01:24:32.101
(yelling)

01:24:32.168 --> 01:24:33.602
(yelling)

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:34.570
(yelling in Spanish)

01:24:34.637 --> 01:24:36.239
¡Rapido!

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.509
(alarm blaring)

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:44.547
Raul, hombre...
¿Que paso?

01:24:44.613 --> 01:24:45.748
(groans)

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:48.417
Okay, no te muevas,
no te muevas, ¿eh?

01:24:50.686 --> 01:24:53.556
(speaking Spanish)

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.861
Sylvia...

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:09.438
(clears throat)

01:25:09.505 --> 01:25:10.573
(sighs)

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:12.007
Ah, Sylvia.

01:25:12.074 --> 01:25:13.142
I'm Tom Watson,

01:25:13.209 --> 01:25:14.710
Human Resources.

01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:24.019
¿Como está?

01:25:24.086 --> 01:25:26.189
How is he?

01:25:26.255 --> 01:25:27.890
Oh, well, he's got
a few cracked ribs,

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:29.592
a pretty bad concussion...

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:32.528
and he has a disc in
his lower back that's hurt.

01:25:32.595 --> 01:25:34.963
But that could've been
a problem before the accident.

01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:39.668
(translator
speaking Spanish)

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.045
¿Va estar bien?

01:25:50.112 --> 01:25:53.216
She says if he's
going to be all right.

01:25:53.282 --> 01:25:54.883
Oh, well, it's going
to be real sore,

01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:56.084
but, yeah, he's
gonna be okay.

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.787
(translator speaking Spanish)

01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:01.824
Now, look, I want you
to tell her that I have

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:04.893
some unpleasant news
that we need to discuss.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.497
(speaking Spanish)

01:26:10.699 --> 01:26:12.601
¿Que pasa?

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:15.904
Raul tested positive
for methamphetamine.

01:26:15.971 --> 01:26:18.507
(speaking Spanish)

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.883
Uh.... ¿Amphetamina?

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:28.817
TOM:
It's an illegal drug.

01:26:28.884 --> 01:26:31.654
It appears he was
using drugs on the job.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.155
(speaking Spanish)

01:26:33.222 --> 01:26:34.223
And this could've
caused the accident.

01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:35.391
(speaking Spanish)

01:26:38.727 --> 01:26:40.128
No les creo.

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.264
She says she
doesn't

01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:43.299
believe you.

01:26:43.366 --> 01:26:45.301
Well, tell her this:
Tell her that UMP

01:26:45.368 --> 01:26:47.336
is committed to a
drug-free workplace

01:26:47.403 --> 01:26:49.204
and if you break the rules,
it endangers others.

01:26:49.272 --> 01:26:50.105
Tell her that.

01:26:50.172 --> 01:26:53.276
(speaking Spanish)

01:26:55.444 --> 01:26:57.480
Pero Raul nunca
ha usada drogas.

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:59.915
She says Raul has
never used any drugs.

01:26:59.982 --> 01:27:02.718
Well, look, I can show her
the result of the blood test.

01:27:02.785 --> 01:27:05.288
(speaking Spanish)

01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:07.022
No les creo.

01:27:07.089 --> 01:27:08.223
She doesn't
believe us.

01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:12.695
I'm sorry
about your husband.

01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:17.700
(sniffling)

01:27:28.311 --> 01:27:30.446
(crying quietly)

01:27:47.363 --> 01:27:49.965
* *

01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:17.326
The problem is,
at this very moment,

01:28:17.393 --> 01:28:18.994
there's about a hundred
thousand cattle

01:28:19.061 --> 01:28:21.964
in the UMP feedlot that's right
outside of Cody.

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:24.032
It's one of the biggest
feedlots in the world.

01:28:24.099 --> 01:28:25.834
Each one of those cows

01:28:25.901 --> 01:28:28.103
puts out 50 pounds of piss
and shit every day.

01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:30.406
Fifty pounds each.

01:28:30.473 --> 01:28:32.140
ALICE:
Lovely.
Yeah, I know so,

01:28:32.207 --> 01:28:36.011
that UMP feedlot produces more
waste every single day,

01:28:36.078 --> 01:28:38.747
than all of the people in,
in Denver combined.

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:40.883
ALICE:
That's gross.
Yeah.

01:28:40.949 --> 01:28:45.087
And the waste from UMP's feedlot
it's not going to some hi-tech

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.321
treatment plant, you know.

01:28:46.389 --> 01:28:48.123
It's being pumped
into these lagoons

01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:51.860
which are these just great big
ponds of piss and shit

01:28:51.927 --> 01:28:54.797
and these great big shit
ponds are leaking shit

01:28:54.863 --> 01:28:55.931
into Payton Creek,

01:28:55.998 --> 01:28:57.933
which eventually ends
up in the river.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.735
I mean you should
see it, UMP's cattle

01:28:59.802 --> 01:29:01.704
they're all just
crammed together,

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:03.338
living in their own manure,

01:29:03.406 --> 01:29:05.474
eating this genetically
engineered crap

01:29:05.541 --> 01:29:08.677
that's being dumped into
these concrete troughs for them.

01:29:08.744 --> 01:29:10.913
It's like prison camps
for cows.

01:29:10.979 --> 01:29:13.549
You wouldn't believe it.
You can smell it

01:29:13.616 --> 01:29:14.617
like three miles away.

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:16.184
So Professor Cohen...

01:29:16.251 --> 01:29:18.821
is going to help us coordinate
a letter writing campaign.

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:21.056
Not only to the State Water
Quality Board,

01:29:21.123 --> 01:29:23.158
but to various editorial
organizations, hopefully to...

01:29:23.225 --> 01:29:24.827
Are you kidding me?

01:29:24.893 --> 01:29:26.595
Excuse me?

01:29:26.662 --> 01:29:29.031
You guys are going
to write a letter.

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:32.100
That's company's the meanest
fucking company

01:29:32.167 --> 01:29:33.168
I've ever seen.

01:29:33.235 --> 01:29:34.703
They treat their workers
like shit,

01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:36.872
they treat the animals
like shit.

01:29:36.939 --> 01:29:38.841
They're dumping tons
of shit and piss

01:29:38.907 --> 01:29:40.976
into our river, and you guys are
going to write a letter?

01:29:41.043 --> 01:29:42.277
Yes, Paco.

01:29:42.344 --> 01:29:43.846
As an official warning,

01:29:43.912 --> 01:29:46.682
to be followed by a
campus wide boycott

01:29:46.749 --> 01:29:47.916
of everything that comes out
of that place.

01:29:47.983 --> 01:29:48.884
The governor

01:29:48.951 --> 01:29:51.019
got $200,000 from UMP

01:29:51.086 --> 01:29:52.020
last year.

01:29:52.087 --> 01:29:53.689
Kathy Crawford--

01:29:53.756 --> 01:29:56.859
head of the Environmental
Committee in the State Senate...

01:29:58.326 --> 01:30:00.663
...she's married
to a UMP top exec.

01:30:00.729 --> 01:30:03.532
And you guys are going
to write a letter.

01:30:03.599 --> 01:30:06.702
What a fucking waste of time.

01:30:06.769 --> 01:30:09.037
Listen, you have got
to start somewhere

01:30:09.104 --> 01:30:10.573
in raising awareness.

01:30:10.639 --> 01:30:11.840
This is bullshit,

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:14.309
this Environmental Policy
Discussion Group.

01:30:14.376 --> 01:30:15.844
Even our name sucks.

01:30:16.945 --> 01:30:18.847
You just make this up
so you can put it on

01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:19.915
your grad school applications,
Andrew?

01:30:19.982 --> 01:30:21.750
Do you have a better
idea, Gerald?

01:30:21.817 --> 01:30:24.319
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Paco?

01:30:24.386 --> 01:30:25.921
Fuck you, man.

01:30:25.988 --> 01:30:27.623
Are you just here
to be the self-
righteous critic, man?

01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:29.257
I don't know, man.

01:30:29.324 --> 01:30:32.728
Action speaks louder.

01:30:32.795 --> 01:30:34.663
I'm tired of nice people
sitting around talking

01:30:34.730 --> 01:30:35.931
and complaining
while the bad guys

01:30:35.998 --> 01:30:37.733
get to do whatever
the fuck they want!

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:40.168
I want to see some action.

01:30:40.235 --> 01:30:41.169
We all do, dude.

01:30:41.236 --> 01:30:42.938
That's what
we're doing here.
Those Greenpeace dudes,

01:30:43.005 --> 01:30:44.540
they put their asses
on the line.

01:30:44.607 --> 01:30:45.841
That's exactly what
we should do.

01:30:45.908 --> 01:30:49.645
You said that
there's, like,

01:30:49.712 --> 01:30:52.114
a hundred thousand
cows, right?

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:53.148
Uh, roughly.

01:30:53.215 --> 01:30:54.249
Well,

01:30:54.316 --> 01:30:58.954
what if we cut the fence

01:30:59.021 --> 01:31:01.524
and let them out?

01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:02.991
Let them run free?

01:31:03.058 --> 01:31:06.161
I mean, that, that might get
some attention.

01:31:06.228 --> 01:31:09.364
See? That's the kind of shit
I'm talking about.

01:31:09.431 --> 01:31:10.699
What's your name?

01:31:10.766 --> 01:31:12.300
Amber.

01:31:12.367 --> 01:31:13.736
Beautiful, Amber.

01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:17.606
Well, think about it.

01:31:17.673 --> 01:31:20.042
I mean, if you
suddenly had
thousands

01:31:20.108 --> 01:31:24.847
and thousands of cows, you know,
wandering free

01:31:24.913 --> 01:31:27.015
wandering back to the prairie
where they belong,

01:31:27.082 --> 01:31:30.886
causing traffic jams,
blocking the highway...

01:31:30.953 --> 01:31:32.354
reminding people

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.623
that cows aren't
supposed to be penned up
and treated that way.

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:37.793
You know,
that's a really good idea,

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:40.062
because then we could issue
a press release with our demands

01:31:40.128 --> 01:31:43.465
showing what a disaster
that company is

01:31:43.532 --> 01:31:44.733
and what we're gonna do next.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.935
We, we can do all this.

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:48.904
I'm just,
I'm warning you guys

01:31:48.971 --> 01:31:50.639
that right now
in this country,

01:31:50.706 --> 01:31:53.041
any destruction of private
property along these lines

01:31:53.108 --> 01:31:55.377
can be considered in violation
of the Patriot Act.

01:31:55.443 --> 01:31:57.846
It can be considered
an act of terrorism.

01:31:57.913 --> 01:32:00.248
You can go to prison
for, like ten years.

01:32:00.315 --> 01:32:02.551
Yeah, that's a bunch
of bullshit.

01:32:02.618 --> 01:32:04.152
I know, I know.

01:32:04.219 --> 01:32:06.589
We have entered a whole new era
where they can search your house

01:32:06.655 --> 01:32:09.091
without a warrant, they can,
they can put you in jail

01:32:09.157 --> 01:32:10.358
without a trial.

01:32:10.425 --> 01:32:13.261
Eco-activists that have
never harmed another human being

01:32:13.328 --> 01:32:15.698
are considered by our government
to be more of a threat

01:32:15.764 --> 01:32:18.667
to national security
than all these right-wing,

01:32:18.734 --> 01:32:22.671
Timothy McVeigh militia types.

01:32:22.738 --> 01:32:25.908
Well, right now, I can't think
of anything more patriotic

01:32:25.974 --> 01:32:29.712
than violating the Patriot Act.

01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:45.027
(electronica playing in
distance)

01:33:06.148 --> 01:33:07.049
(shuts off stereo)

01:34:32.034 --> 01:34:33.568
This industry's fucked.

01:34:33.635 --> 01:34:37.505
There's rumors
UMP's planning to sell
the plant or shut us down.

01:34:37.572 --> 01:34:39.541
They got plants
all over the U.S.,

01:34:39.607 --> 01:34:41.076
fucking Canada.

01:34:41.143 --> 01:34:43.478
If the Cody plant don't start
pulling its weight,

01:34:43.545 --> 01:34:44.813
yeah, they'll shut us down.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.682
Don't matter we been here
35 fucking years.

01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:49.117
They don't give a fuck
about Cody

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:52.020
and they sure as shit
don't give a fuck about me.

01:35:10.806 --> 01:35:13.075
(heavy breathing)

01:35:23.819 --> 01:35:26.188
(Tony grunting)

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.797
(cattle lowing)

01:35:40.268 --> 01:35:41.804
(grunts)

01:35:42.504 --> 01:35:44.539
Jesus, fuck!

01:35:44.606 --> 01:35:45.673
This is taking forever, man.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:47.475
Always cut fences.

01:35:49.778 --> 01:35:50.913
That's the golden rule.

01:35:50.979 --> 01:35:52.848
That's good.
Come on, buddies.

01:35:52.915 --> 01:35:54.382
Come on, babies,
run for it!

01:35:54.449 --> 01:35:55.483
Let's go. Come on!

01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:57.185
Let's go!

01:35:57.252 --> 01:35:58.821
Watch you don't step
in the shit.

01:35:58.887 --> 01:36:00.555
Come on, babies,
run for it!

01:36:00.622 --> 01:36:01.824
Let's spread out.
Guys, come on.

01:36:01.890 --> 01:36:03.959
All right, let's get
a move on. Come on.

01:36:04.026 --> 01:36:04.993
Come on. Here you go.

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.428
Come on.
Come on.
Here you go!

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:09.031
Come on.
This way. This way.
Right there.

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:11.299
Come on.
They're not doing anything.

01:36:11.366 --> 01:36:12.901
Come on. This way!

01:36:12.968 --> 01:36:15.170
Get 'em over here.
Come on, baby, let's go.

01:36:15.237 --> 01:36:17.605
Come on.
Go out that way.
Go out that way.

01:36:17.672 --> 01:36:19.307
(cattle lowing)

01:36:19.374 --> 01:36:20.675
(makes kissing sound)

01:36:20.742 --> 01:36:22.210
Why won't they go?!

01:36:22.277 --> 01:36:24.847
ANDREW:
What the fuck is wrong
with them?

01:36:24.913 --> 01:36:26.348
PACO: Hey, get your
asses in gear!

01:36:26.414 --> 01:36:29.818
How stupid are they?

01:36:29.885 --> 01:36:30.986
Show them there's a hole
in the fence.

01:36:31.053 --> 01:36:32.554
I don't think they can see it.

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:34.589
Come on. Lookit.

01:36:34.656 --> 01:36:36.058
Look, there's no fence.

01:36:36.124 --> 01:36:38.961
Run! Come on! No fence!

01:36:39.027 --> 01:36:39.862
Come on!
Come on.

01:36:39.928 --> 01:36:41.296
Come on. Come on.

01:36:41.363 --> 01:36:43.966
Over here.
This way!
No fence,
you fucking morons!

01:36:44.032 --> 01:36:47.169
Whoa! That motherfucker
almost just gored me, man!

01:36:47.235 --> 01:36:48.136
(chuckles)

01:36:48.203 --> 01:36:49.304
Don't you want to be free?

01:36:49.371 --> 01:36:50.372
It's wide open! Go!

01:36:50.438 --> 01:36:52.340
They're gonna kill you!

01:36:52.407 --> 01:36:55.043
They're gonna kill every
single one of you!

01:36:56.378 --> 01:36:56.979
Car!

01:36:57.045 --> 01:36:58.847
ALICE:
Oh, shit!

01:36:58.914 --> 01:37:00.182
Time to...
Time to go!

01:37:00.248 --> 01:37:01.249
Time to go.

01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:03.618
Come on! Let's get
out of here!

01:37:03.685 --> 01:37:05.420
Come on, don't you want to be
free?

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:08.090
Don't you want to be free?

01:37:09.958 --> 01:37:11.459
ALICE:
Come on!
ANDREW:
Amber!

01:37:11.526 --> 01:37:13.028
ALICE:
Come on, Amber!

01:37:13.095 --> 01:37:15.497
PACO:
Car's that way, Andrew.

01:37:15.563 --> 01:37:16.731
Come on, Amber!

01:37:16.798 --> 01:37:17.866
We gotta hit the road!

01:37:17.933 --> 01:37:20.402
Let's go!
(groans)

01:37:20.468 --> 01:37:22.470
Move!

01:37:22.537 --> 01:37:24.206
Come on! Come on!

01:37:24.272 --> 01:37:26.308
Let's go!

01:37:26.374 --> 01:37:29.277
(cattle lowing)

01:37:34.482 --> 01:37:36.384
(knocking at door)

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:44.459
What a fuckin' fiasco.

01:37:44.526 --> 01:37:47.162
Well, look, nobody
got arrested.
Nobody got hurt.

01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:48.630
Yeah, and we
learned something.

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:49.932
Yeah?

01:37:49.998 --> 01:37:50.899
Don't try something
unless you know

01:37:50.966 --> 01:37:51.934
what the hell you're doing.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.170
Next time we bring
cattle prods.

01:37:55.237 --> 01:37:56.538
That was our only mistake.

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:58.073
Oh, yeah, that's a good one.

01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:59.607
Paco, ace cattle rustler
from New Jersey.

01:37:59.674 --> 01:38:00.642
Fuck you!

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:02.877
At least we tried, man.

01:38:02.945 --> 01:38:04.312
Better than sitting
on our asses.

01:38:04.379 --> 01:38:05.547
AMBER:
I just don't
understand.

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:08.116
I mean, why would they want to
stay in there?

01:38:08.183 --> 01:38:09.717
ALICE:
Well, let's face it.

01:38:09.784 --> 01:38:11.419
Cows aren't the brightest
animals.

01:38:11.486 --> 01:38:12.220
ANDREW:
Who knows?

01:38:12.287 --> 01:38:14.656
Maybe it's easier in there.

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:16.124
They get all the food they want.

01:38:16.191 --> 01:38:17.659
I bet that genetically
engineered shit

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:18.860
tastes a lot better than grass.

01:38:18.927 --> 01:38:21.029
I think they're just scared.

01:38:21.096 --> 01:38:23.565
Yeah, so was Andrew. Did you see
how fuckin' fast he ran?

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:24.299
ANDREW:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:38:24.366 --> 01:38:26.568
And you were right
behind me, fucker.

01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:28.270
I don't know.

01:38:28.336 --> 01:38:30.638
How come in real life
the bad guys always win?

01:38:30.705 --> 01:38:34.209
ANDREW: Well, you know,
they do until they don't.

01:38:34.276 --> 01:38:37.445
(announcer speaking Spanish)

01:39:25.393 --> 01:39:28.763
(announcer speaking Spanish)

01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:30.298
(grunts)

01:39:59.627 --> 01:40:01.463
(toilet flushes)

01:40:13.541 --> 01:40:15.777
(cart rumbling)

01:40:47.409 --> 01:40:48.643
Last night, hombre.

01:41:11.133 --> 01:41:13.668
(mooing)

01:41:23.044 --> 01:41:24.779
(zapping)

01:41:48.236 --> 01:41:51.173
* *

01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:10.825
* *

01:42:31.279 --> 01:42:33.615
* *

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:06.648
* *

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:48.323
Okay, Mike.

01:44:10.211 --> 01:44:12.414
* *

01:44:32.133 --> 01:44:34.536
* *

01:44:56.691 --> 01:44:58.025
(shouts)

01:45:11.005 --> 01:45:14.376
* *

01:46:14.569 --> 01:46:16.704
...which all adds up
to us believing

01:46:16.771 --> 01:46:18.806
that next quarter will be
the best time

01:46:18.873 --> 01:46:21.976
to introduce
a major new product.

01:46:22.043 --> 01:46:23.811
And along those lines, um...

01:46:23.878 --> 01:46:26.481
Don, you want to take it
from here?

01:46:28.883 --> 01:46:30.452
Yeah.

01:46:30.518 --> 01:46:33.621
Um, well, as you all know,
The Barbecue Big One's

01:46:33.688 --> 01:46:35.657
been testing off the charts
for months.

01:46:35.723 --> 01:46:38.192
And I really feel like

01:46:38.259 --> 01:46:41.629
the marketing department's
nailed the campaign, Jack.

01:46:43.665 --> 01:46:46.167
So, it's obviously
time for the big launch.

01:46:48.503 --> 01:46:52.406
And... we couldn't
be more ready to go.

01:47:08.723 --> 01:47:11.759
(percussive electronica playing)

01:47:38.152 --> 01:47:41.155
* *

01:48:08.082 --> 01:48:11.085
* *

01:48:30.638 --> 01:48:34.108
(slow electronica playing)

01:49:04.505 --> 01:49:07.609
* *

01:49:37.438 --> 01:49:40.808
* *

01:50:10.471 --> 01:50:13.675
* *

01:50:43.437 --> 01:50:47.875
* *

01:51:44.498 --> 01:51:47.935
* *

01:52:17.598 --> 01:52:20.367
* *

01:52:50.564 --> 01:52:53.835
* *
