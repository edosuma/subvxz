00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
NARRATOR: Towards the end

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
of the 2008 campaign,

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
the Republican party, terrified at their own

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
sinking poll numbers, attempted to link Barack Obama

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
to radical leftist figures to make him appear un-American.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
First was the controversial Reverend Jeremiah Wright.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
I say motherfuck America,
motherfuck America's mother,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
motherfuck America's daddy!

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
America can eat a dick!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
America can lick the balls!

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
When that failed, Republicans tried linking Obama

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
with 10-year-old domestic terrorist Huey Freeman

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
after discovering the two were MySpace friends.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Did they leave each other
glitter comments?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
The public has
a right to know.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Okay, this is a little boy
who thinks that Jesus is black,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Ronald Reagan is the devil

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
and the government
is lying about 9/11.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Kids like this need to be
on America's shit list,

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
not our friend list.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Obama did his best to downplay the relationship.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Look, I have many,
many friends on MySpace.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I-- I pretty much
add anybody.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I don't know
who this Huey Freeman is,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
but he doesn't stand
for what I stand for

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
and I denounce, I repudiate,
and condemn him.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Basically fuck him.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
NARRATOR: I tracked down the notoriously

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
reclusive Huey Freeman here,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
where he lives with his Grandfather and brother.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
The first thing I notice about Huey

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
is his incredibly large hair.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
The second thing I notice is his permanent scowl.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
How does it feel to be labeled
a domestic terrorist?

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Eh, I'm retired.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
So then, now that it looks
like Obama is going to win,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
as a black
African American negro,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
are you merely excited
or are you extremely excited

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
that everything is going
to change forever?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Eh.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I felt my sphincter clinch

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
and my scrotum contract in shock

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
at his response.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I swear that boy
just likes to be miserable.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
He can't enjoy nothing.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
All he wanna talk about
is the Bilderberg Group,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
the Federal Reserve
and all that bullshit.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I don't know where
he get that from.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
He didn't get it from me.
I believe in hope and change.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
NARRATOR: Nobody knows exactly how old

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Robert Freeman is.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Not even Robert Freeman himself.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
But his age is estimated

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
somewhere between 80 and 120 years old.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
This is what me
and my generation,

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
but mostly me, struggled for.
Sacrificed for, you can say,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
personally individually
paved the way for.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
The dogs were after us,
so I took off my belt

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
and started whipping
on the dogs.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Then I started running.
Then I looked behind me.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Jesse Jackson was supposed
to be there,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
but he had jumped
into a Dumpster. Hiding.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
That punk-ass.
NARRATOR:  I find it difficult

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
to determine whether Robert is a pathological liar

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
or suffering the early stages of dementia.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
So if the election is fake,
then what's really going on?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
The end of America.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I felt despair so terrible

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I briefly consider slitting my own wrists,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
or bludgeoning myself about the head

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
with a steel pipe or baseball bat.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
But I brought no blade, no pipe, no bat.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Describe Riley Freeman
in one word.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Mm, I'd say real nigga.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
"Real nigga"
is two words.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I know it's two words, nigga.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Real niggas
don't follow instructions.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
NARRATOR: This is Robert Freeman's

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
other grandson, Riley.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
He's empowered by the prospect of a black president,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
but not in the way society would hope or expect.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Oh, if my nigga Obama
gets up in there,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I'm gonna act a fool!

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
I ain't doing
no more homework, nothing.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
We taking over.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Come on, what's a cop
gonna do to me?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm gonna be like, "Don't make
me call the president, bitch."

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And the cops, he gonna be like,
"Oh, snap, Riley a real nigga,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
the president's a real nigga,
we can't do nothing."

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I can't wait.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
In my driveway

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I got planes

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
NARRATOR: This is Otis Jenkins.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
But in the United States, he's better known

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
by his rap moniker Thugnificent.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
A combination of the words "thug" and "magnificent."

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Otis has found success

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
like many Negro-American entertainers today

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
by being a professional buffoon.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Are you supporting
Barack Obama?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
For what?
For president.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
President of what?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
You don't know
there's a black man

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
running for president
named Barack Obama?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
His name is Barack?
For real?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Barack Obama, yes.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Get the fuck out of here.
Barack?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Yes, Barack.
Where's he from, Africa?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
His dad was African,
yes.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
You can't be serious, man.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
There ain't no nigga running for
president named Barack Obama!

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
No fucking way, man.
No fucking way.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I don't believe you.
Stop fucking with me.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
If he wins, I think
it will literally be

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
the best day
of my life.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
NARRATOR: Tom and Sarah Dubois

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
are also neighbors of the Freemans.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
They both work on the Obama campaign.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Barack has already changed
our lives in so many ways.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
NARRATOR:
How?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, I mean,
it's no secret

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
that me and Tom have had
some problems in the past

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
with our relationship.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Well, it's not like
the whole world knew.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
But I think ever since

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
we started working
together for Barack...

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Things are
totally different now.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Much better. And it's all thanks
to Barack.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
He is such a wonderful,
wonderful man.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I just think it's about time
we had a president

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
who was smart and tall and
charming and strong and fit.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Just like your hubby?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
This isn't about you,
sweetie.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
NARRATOR: It is always obvious

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
when a couple hasn't engaged

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
in normal marital relations for some time.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Obama, of course, is as polarizing

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
as he is transformative.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Some have accused Obama of being a socialist.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Others believe that he's a Muslim.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Some have gone as far as to label him the Antichrist.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
He is the socialist Muslim
Antichrist.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
This is Uncle Ruckus.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
He's an Uncle Tom.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Perhaps the biggest Uncle Tom to have ever lived.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
If this nigga gets elected,
America is over. Over.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
You want this nigga to shit

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
in the same place
William Taft shat?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
And his big wife, she don't need
to be in the White House.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
She should be in the WNBA
shooting foul shots.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Ah. You want my brick,
you gonna have to pry it

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
from my cold dead hands,
Mr. Obama Hussein.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Nigga down!

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
NARRATOR:
What is wrong with letting

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
people be happy?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Can too much hope
possibly be a bad thing?

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Hope is irrational.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
In Bavaria, we have a saying:

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
It means, "This is the most depressing fucking kid

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I've ever met in my life."

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I sit down once again with Thugnificent,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
who appears to have undergone a political awakening

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
since our last conversation.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
So you know
who Obama is now?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Oh, no, I knew
who the nigga was.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I was just joking.
You were not joking.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
You jumped on the Obama
celebrity bandwagon

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
because it will give you
much needed exposure.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
No, see. It ain't even got
nothing to do with that.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
You know what I'm saying?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I started looking into his
political positions and his--

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
And his policies
and views and whatnot.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
What policies?
I heard the nigga speak,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
and he was talking
about changing some shit

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
or hoping for some shit,
and I thought: "Yeah."

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I mean, all the nigga's
asking for is hope.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
You can sit on your ass
all day and hope.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
If you too lazy to hope
you a lazy motherfucker,

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
that's all I know.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
I'm voting for Obama

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
because he's gonna
lower my taxes.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
NARRATOR:
Actually, he has promised

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
to raise taxes
at your income level.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Huh?

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
And he's just
really, really fit...

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
to lead.
And also body fit too.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Well, I also support Obama

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
because he's against
corporate bailouts.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
That is also not true.
Huh?

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
I'm supporting Obama
because he black.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
And he's gonna get the troops
out of Afghanistan, right?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Also wrong.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Then what the fuck
that nigga gonna do?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
We all need to, you know,
do some shit sometimes.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
You know what I'm saying?
Some shit needs to get done.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And until we do that shit,
shit ain't gonna change.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
So I thought to myself,
"Let's do this shit."

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
And that's when will.i.am
called me

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
about doing this damn song.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
NARRATOR: Thugnificent joins

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
will.i.am's all-star celebrity tribute to Barack Obama.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Things weren't working right

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
I said, I wanna fight

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
And said, yes, we can

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I want to ride your nuts

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
You're the man

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
WILL.I.AM:

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
THUGNIFICENT:

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
Riding, riding

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Dick-riding for the gay

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Dick-riding for Iraq

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
To ride that dick

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
As it's Barack's

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Dick-riding

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
NARRATOR: It is finally election night.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Robert Freeman is throwing a party.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Well, it's been
a long, black struggle.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And I felt me and Barack
deserved a party.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
NARRATOR: All around I see black faces

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
beaming with elation.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Yeah, man, I'm gonna be
the next black president.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
NARRATOR: It is as though each of them

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
has been elected president.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Almost each of them.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
What's wrong with you?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I thought you'd be
dancing on your tail

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
with the rest of the circus
chimps. Look at them.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Just as happy
as a pig in shit.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Can't they see?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Can't they see
what this nigga's gonna do

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
to our great country?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Looks like we the only
two people with sense

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
in this whole room.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Just you and me.
Just you and me.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
GRANDDAD:
Ruckus, shut up

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and get back to work.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
And grab some more champagne.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
See? Niggas already
getting uppity.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
So I'm thinking
that this gonna be my new look.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh. That's a way to go.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I mean, I feel like
it's more grown-up.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Like, having
tighter clothes

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
is gonna make people
take me more seriously.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
It's really gonna happen.
It's all gonna be better now.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
It's all gonna be better.
Right, honey?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Tom, I'm trying
to watch this.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Yo, yo, yo, I heard
the presidential limo

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
is gonna be like a crazy
pimped out Cadillac now,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
with rims and, like,
machine guns and lasers.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Excuse me.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I'd like to propose
a toast.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Now I'd just
like to say

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
that today is a very
special day for me.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I hope you all are enjoying
the cheese, wine

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
and freedom I have struggled
so hard to provide tonight.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
And because of my pain
and suffering,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
the black struggle
is officially over.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
No longer can they
keep us down.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
No longer can we
be silenced--

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Shh! This is it!
Shut up! Shut up!

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And now we have the returns

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
from the West Coast coming in here.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Okay. And so yes, folks, we are calling it.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Barack Hussein Obama will be

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
the next President of the United States.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
MAN: Yes!

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Obama! Obama!

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Obama!
Yeah, Obama!

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
For the first time in my life,
I am proud to be an American.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah!

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Why, Lord?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
ALL:
Obama! Obama!

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Obama!

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Obama.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
NARRATOR: It is days before inauguration,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
and Obama Mania is at a fever pitch.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
I return to Woodcrest to check on the Freemans.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
I don't necessarily think
of myself as a hero.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
And when people always
ask me if I want a medal

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
or a monument or a statue
in my honor, I say,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
"No, mm-mm. Mm-mm."

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
All I want to do
is be there in person,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
on that glorious day,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
when the first black president
take the oath.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I just want to stand in the
crowd, somewhere in the front,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
maybe in the VIP section,
maybe next to Beyoncé.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Are you aware
that some people are paying

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
as much as $50,000
for VIP inauguration tickets?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Well, I don't think you can put
a price on decades of struggle.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
Did you contribute any money
at all to the Obama campaign?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I paid 10 bucks
for this T-shirt.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Did you get that from
the campaign website?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
No, I got it from the guy
at the car wash,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
but it's still free advertising
when I wear it outside.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
A lot of people
see me in this shirt.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I mean, before
we change the world,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
we gotta change
ourselves first.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I mean, this is
the new colorless,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
flavorless and unscented era.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Like, from now on, I'm calling
all my niggas "Obamas."

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And all my bitches
I'm calling "Michelles."

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Think about it.
If you was a bitch, right,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
would you rather be called
a "bitch" or "Michelle"?

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
And what about
bitches named Michelle?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Man, you making jokes. I'm
trying to uplift my Obamas.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Yes, can you tell
the president-elect

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
it's Civil Rights legend
Robert Freeman.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
F-R-E-E-M-A-N, who struggled
to open the door

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
for him to be president.
You got all that?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Right. Just tell him
I'm calling again

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
about those tickets.
Again.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Hey, man,
I got that Obama water.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Change the way
you hydrate, brother.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Yo, little man.
Hey, hey, check it out.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I got commemorative plates,
two for 20.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
How many you need?
I'm cool.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
You believe in a few days we're
gonna have a black president?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Aren't you excited,
little man?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Eh.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
"Eh"?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
What's "eh"
supposed to mean?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Just means "eh."

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
What the deal man?
What's going on here?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
MAN: Yo, what's deal?
I asked this kid

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
if he was excited about Obama
and he said "eh".

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
"Eh"? He said "eh"?
Yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
What's wrong with you?
You not excited?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Not excited?
Who ain't excited?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
This little nigga.
Why ain't he excited?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
You don't like Obama.
You want McCain to win.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
I never said that--
Why ain't you like Barack Obama?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
He got
a lovely family.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Not according
to this little nigga.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
He got a problem
with a black president.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Boy, what's going on?
What did I tell you

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
about talking to anybody
about anything?

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
I didn't say anything.
I ought to kick your ass.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Everybody,
just calm down.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Make a hole, darkies.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Just what the hell
is going on here?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Ruckus?
Oh, no.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
This little big-haired
nigga hates Obama.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And I say good for him.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Leave this little boy alone.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
He telling the truth.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Barack Obama
is an evil man.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Hey, everybody,
just calm down.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
You heard us.
You say "Yes, we can."

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
We say,
"No, you can't, nigga."

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
MAN:
Oh, hell no!

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
RUCKUS:
Ow! I can't see!

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
It's a monkey stampede!

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Race war!
Somebody get him!

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Idiots.
Get in the car quick.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
RILEY:
Drive! Drive! Go, Granddad!

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
NARRATOR: The American press struggles

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
to comprehend the incident.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
To them, Huey is like a calf

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
that refuses its mother's udder,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
choosing instead to drink the bitter waters

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
of its own making.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Here is the danger of too much hope.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Skeptics are treated like blasphemers,

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
and indifference becomes equal to hate.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Robert Freeman calls a press conference

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
to do damage control.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Huey Freeman
is not really my grandson.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I refute, renounce,
and rebuke him.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I hope this incident
in no way affects my request

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
for VIP inaugural tickets,

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
and/or slash the inaugural ball
with Beyoncé.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Rosa Parks
is no longer with us,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
but I consider myself to be
the next best thing.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
In many ways, better.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
NARRATOR:
Where is your wife?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
She's in, uh, D.C.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
There was a problem or
something with the tickets,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
so we only had one
and I let her have it.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Are you afraid
your wife will have

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
lusty sex
with Barack Obama?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
What? No!

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
No. That's impossible.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I didn't ask
if it was possible,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
only if you were afraid.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
I can't help but notice
you are like a less attractive,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
less wealthy, less powerful
version of him.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
It is quite understandable
for you to be concerned.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
NEWSCASTER: Celebrities, dignitaries

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
and Civil Rights legends

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
are arriving in droves for the inauguration of Barack Obama.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Anyone hoping to get tickets at this point, don't bother.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
The ship has sailed and you are not on it,

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
because you are not important.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Hey, Granddad,
this was at the door.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
"Office of the president-elect?"

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
: "Mr. Freeman.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
"Please find enclosed two VIP tickets to the inauguration,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
"as well as the inaugural ball with Beyoncé,

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
"as a small token of gratitude for all the sacrifices

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
"you've made on behalf of me and this great country.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
"I look forward to sharing this historic day with you.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Sincerely, President-Elect Barack Obama."

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
What's going on?
I'm going to the inauguration.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
You wanna come?
Yeah, boy!

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
NARRATOR: And just like that,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
virtually foaming at the mouth with unbridled excitement,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Robert and Riley leave for the inauguration.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
You are looking at the final mission

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
of a domestic terrorist.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Operation Exodus.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
Convinced he has no place in Obama's America,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Huey Freeman decides to leave the country for good.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
And he has an unlikely companion.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I was gonna go
to the inauguration

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
and try to crown Obama with
a brick, but who am I fooling?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
My arm just ain't
what it used to be.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Plus, that greasy nigga
is really fast.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
And knowing these
liberal activist judges,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
they might actually try
and put me in jail for it.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
No, I think...

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I think it's time for me
to leave this great country.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Oh, I can't bear to see it run

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
by an African Muslim
Communist Antichrist.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I just can't.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
It's just like when
Nicole Brown Simpson

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
married that nigga O.J.
back on February 2, 1985.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Oh, I knew it was gonna
end badly. I told them.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I told them all.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
But nobody wanted to listen

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
to old Uncle Ruckus
then neither.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
I wanna go someplace I'll fit
in, like Norway or Ireland.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
HUEY:
What about the Ivory Coast?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Absolutely no Africa!
No way!

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
All them countries got
nigga presidents,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
which defeats the whole purpose
of leaving this country.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
NARRATOR:
How do you feel being teamed up

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
with your archenemy?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
First of all,
we're not a team.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Second of all,
we're not a team.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I've got gas money,
he's got the license.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
We're just gonna
drive to Canada

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
and then go
our separate ways.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
You see, Bill, I consider
myself a black leader now,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
and that means helping Obama
and doing anything he asks.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Oh, yes, I can hear
your concern

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
for the state of the world
in that song you did

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
about stomping people
in the nuts.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh, that was the old me.
Everything's different now.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I'm much, much more politically
aware and stuff.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Really? Well, name the three
branches of government then.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
The what?
Come on, black leader.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
It's fourth grade
Social Studies time.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
What are the three branches
of government?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Uh, let's see.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
They got the main branch.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Uh...

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
If you're a black leader,
I'm glad I'm a white man.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
MAN:
What a moron.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
What's the point of talking
if nobody ever learns?

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
This is an outrage.
I have my rights.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Oh, them bricks ain't mine.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Ain't that a surprise.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Already taking away

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
my constitutional right
to bear bricks.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Martial law!
Martial law!

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Get your arms off of me.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
OBAMA: We remain a young nation,

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
but in the words of Scripture,

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
the time has come to set aside childish things.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
to choose our part in history.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
No! Please!
I have VIP tickets!

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
We all got VIP tickets!

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Hey.
Get your hands off me.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
All right,
you in trouble now.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I'm calling my nigga Obeezy.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Please don't Tase me.
Don't Tase me, bro.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
I'm a old man.
I got a heart condition.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
You can't do this to me!
I'm a Civil Rights legend!

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Save us, Obama!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
NARRATOR: Huey Freeman is forced

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
to abort Operation Exodus

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
because he cannot get a ride.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Barack Obama?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I just found out that fool
is gonna raise my taxes.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
His promises are just
like his tickets: worthless.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Good thing I didn't vote
for his lying ass.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Obama ain't no real nigga.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
And check this out:

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I heard he works
for the feds.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
That ain't a good look,
Barack.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Washington
was indescribable.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
It was just so amazing.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And I got to meet him.
NARRATOR: Was he everything

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
you dreamed he would be?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Oh, yes, he was.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
And so much more.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Oh, yeah, I'm still down
for the cause and shit,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
but I'm like, hey, I did my
part, you know what I'm saying?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I got the nigga elected.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Time to get back to work,
feel me?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Doing what Thugnificent do.
Besides, them tight-ass clothes

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
was cutting off
my circulation.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Due to the conditions
of my parole,

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
I am unable to leave
the country at this time.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
I am forced to remain here and
express my extreme displeasure

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
while in no way threatening

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
the life of the president
and his beautiful monkey family.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
NARRATOR: I ask Huey Freeman

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
if he has any final thoughts

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
he'd like to share.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Yeah. I'm retired.
