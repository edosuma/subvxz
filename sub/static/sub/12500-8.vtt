Here you go, Rangers.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.363
Ugh.

00:13.364 --> 00:15.225
I, uh... I...

00:15.226 --> 00:17.359
Excuse us, Ma'am.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.954
- Oh, shit. Did you see how ug...
- Beautiful she is?

00:19.955 --> 00:21.174
- Yeah.
- Beautiful?

00:21.175 --> 00:23.512
Steve, she looks just like
you, but with smaller titties.

00:23.513 --> 00:26.983
Keep it in your pants,
Denzel. I saw her first.

00:26.984 --> 00:28.759
Oh, did I hit something?

00:28.760 --> 00:31.853
Only my heart with your arrow of love.

00:31.854 --> 00:33.916
And also all these animals.

00:33.917 --> 00:36.077
Help me.

00:37.028 --> 00:40.505
Sorry, I was just reading a
book. I get so bored when I drive.

00:40.506 --> 00:44.133
Viggo Mortensen and lasagna?
My two favorite things!

00:44.134 --> 00:46.267
Hi. I'm Steve Williams.

00:46.268 --> 00:48.536
Ranger of the month. I'm
sure you've heard of me.

00:48.537 --> 00:50.680
I'm ranger of the month. Steve Williams.

00:50.681 --> 00:53.208
I'm Stephanie Bridges. I
teach at Hazelhurst Elementary.

00:53.209 --> 00:57.111
I would love to have a big, powerful
ranger come and speak to my class sometime.

00:57.112 --> 00:59.375
A Power Ranger? I want to see that.

00:59.376 --> 01:02.383
A Power Ranger is speaking to my class?

01:02.384 --> 01:06.404
I didn't know about that. Awesome.

01:07.398 --> 01:13.298
If these mother[Bleep] have a baby,
I'm hitting that bitch with a brick.

01:14.091 --> 01:15.324
Aah!

01:15.325 --> 01:17.993
<i>♪ Brickleberry!</i>

01:17.994 --> 01:20.694
<i>♪ Brickleberry!</i>

01:22.863 --> 01:25.485
Thanks for helping me with
computer dating, Connie.

01:25.486 --> 01:28.467
- You're such a good friend.
- I'd do anything for you, Ethel.

01:28.468 --> 01:30.760
- I know.
- Anything.

01:30.761 --> 01:31.962
Uh, yeah. Got it.

01:31.963 --> 01:33.704
- Anything.
- Got it!

01:33.705 --> 01:35.974
No. No, seriously.

01:35.975 --> 01:39.153
- Anyth...
- I know! God, I hope this works.

01:39.154 --> 01:40.872
Why do I have such bad luck with men?

01:40.873 --> 01:42.924
Maybe you've just been
dating the wrong people.

01:42.925 --> 01:45.020
What? Don't be silly.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.382
And that's why I worship Satan.

01:47.383 --> 01:49.483
Kidding.

01:49.552 --> 01:52.548
I'd love to make a
hammock out of your skin.

01:52.549 --> 01:54.107
I like vagina.

01:54.108 --> 01:56.473
I like vagina.

01:56.474 --> 01:58.112
Hmm.

01:58.113 --> 02:00.888
- Is this kosher?
- Ugh, you're right.

02:00.889 --> 02:05.160
My sister has the perfect marriage, and I'm
on the Internet playing date rape roulette.

02:05.161 --> 02:07.061
Oh, you mean Craigslist.

02:07.062 --> 02:09.374
Hey, wait. This guy seems perfect.

02:09.375 --> 02:12.023
Strong, passionate, wants a family.

02:12.024 --> 02:14.405
Willing to do anything.

02:14.406 --> 02:16.517
Anything. Anything.

02:16.518 --> 02:17.791
Wait a minute. It's you.

02:17.792 --> 02:19.997
How'd that get on there?

02:19.998 --> 02:21.643
Isn't that hilarious?

02:21.644 --> 02:25.495
I mean, I thought it was someone
perfect for me, and it was just you.

02:25.496 --> 02:28.118
Yeah. That's hilarious.

02:28.119 --> 02:31.119
I'll be right back.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.881
Connie, I really need you.

02:33.882 --> 02:35.933
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Ugh!

02:35.934 --> 02:36.866
Ow.

02:36.867 --> 02:39.980
Look at this guy. He's
handsome, he owns a car.

02:39.981 --> 02:43.473
Oh, and look. Only two
roommates... his mother and father.

02:43.474 --> 02:48.454
And he wants to take me
to a fancy restaurant.

02:51.979 --> 02:53.230
You know, that reminds me.

02:53.231 --> 02:55.632
I'm hitting the age where
I'd like to have kids.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.281
Yeah, I like hitting kids too.

02:57.282 --> 03:02.102
Who do I gotta [Bleep] up the
ass to get some corn bread?

03:02.103 --> 03:03.651
Mm. Mm.

03:03.652 --> 03:07.890
So the broad gives
birth as I'm banging her.

03:07.891 --> 03:09.507
That counts as a threesome, right?

03:09.508 --> 03:11.649
You're late on your child
support payments, Ken.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.467
What? I don't even know you.

03:14.468 --> 03:17.920
Tell Alopecia daddy said Happy Birthday.

03:17.921 --> 03:20.018
You know what? I'm out of here!

03:20.019 --> 03:22.917
Baby, baby. I'm sorry. I just
made that up to impress you.

03:22.918 --> 03:27.297
Can we start over? I'll
treat you the way you deserve.

03:27.298 --> 03:29.934
Hurry up. I'm harder than Chinese math.

03:29.935 --> 03:32.252
- Sit on my penis.
- What's that, Ken?

03:32.253 --> 03:35.393
Shut up, ma! I'm about to get some!

03:35.394 --> 03:37.297
Oh. Oh, baby.

03:37.298 --> 03:39.929
I'm gonna make love to you all ni...

03:39.930 --> 03:41.662
I... ah... ah...

03:41.663 --> 03:43.426
Ech... eek... agh. Ugh.

03:43.427 --> 03:45.124
Okay, I'm done.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.766
- Can I at least get a ride home?
- Jeez, fine.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.034
Mom!

03:49.035 --> 03:52.155
Give her a ride home!

03:53.067 --> 03:55.347
I am a...

03:55.597 --> 03:58.085
Pa... pa... park...

03:58.086 --> 04:00.241
What the hell are you two idiots up to?

04:00.242 --> 04:03.464
We've had three snake attacks,
a camper vandalized a moose,

04:03.465 --> 04:05.926
and I found a human
head in the fire pit!

04:05.927 --> 04:09.122
Did you say "human"? Aw, I
was hoping it was Connie's.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.841
I'm gonna kill you one day, Malloy.

04:10.842 --> 04:12.096
- What?
- Uh, nothing.

04:12.097 --> 04:15.983
Guys, could you keep it down? I'm trying to
practice my speech for Stephanie's school.

04:15.984 --> 04:17.750
Good morning, boys and girls.

04:17.752 --> 04:20.428
- My name is...
- Hanukkah Jizz Tonsil?

04:20.428 --> 04:22.526
Yes. My name is Hanukkah Jizz Tonsil.

04:22.527 --> 04:24.551
Wait. No it's not.

04:24.552 --> 04:26.962
Wait. Is it? Shoot.

04:26.963 --> 04:29.758
He's awful at literally everything.

04:29.759 --> 04:32.639
I am a park ra...

04:36.112 --> 04:39.096
- I think the kids are gonna love it.
- Sorry I'm late.

04:39.097 --> 04:42.765
- Ugh, we hear that once a month.
- So how did it go last night?

04:42.766 --> 04:46.919
Typical. We had soup, and
he spooged in his pants.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.100
Hello? Lucy!

04:49.101 --> 04:50.571
It's my bitch sister.

04:50.572 --> 04:52.936
It's been years. How are you?

04:52.937 --> 04:54.704
I've... I've been meaning to call you.

04:54.705 --> 04:58.137
Just traveling with the family
on Al Pacino's private jet.

04:58.138 --> 05:00.573
Our son, Randy, is going
to be in Al's next movie.

05:00.574 --> 05:03.428
- Oh, wow. That's...
- And then, of course, my husband, Hubert.

05:03.429 --> 05:06.270
He just sold his business, so now
we're in the market for a new island.

05:06.271 --> 05:08.839
We were going to buy Haiti, but
it's too much of a fixer-upper.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.979
Speaking of poor black
people, how are you?

05:10.980 --> 05:13.126
Oh, I'm married with a great family too!

05:13.127 --> 05:16.748
You have a family? Did you bite a hole in
the condom or have a five-guy cream pie?

05:16.749 --> 05:18.515
Just kidding. I can't wait to meet them.

05:18.516 --> 05:21.317
We're turning this plane
around. We're coming to see you.

05:21.318 --> 05:23.484
Oh, no, no. Don't! Uh,
uh... don't... don't do that.

05:23.485 --> 05:25.033
Oh, my God!

05:25.034 --> 05:26.685
Lucy, listen. I...

05:26.686 --> 05:28.953
Nah, it's Ken. Sorry about last night.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.306
Why don't you come over now
and I'll make it up to you?

05:31.307 --> 05:32.986
I'll bend you over and...

05:32.987 --> 05:36.900
Ah, ah, ah, ah... oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ugh!

05:36.901 --> 05:40.861
Okay, done. No need to come over.

05:44.568 --> 05:49.548
And that's what it means
to be a Park Ranger.

05:51.279 --> 05:53.108
That was great, Steve.

05:53.109 --> 05:56.169
I want to thank you.

05:57.707 --> 06:00.976
What are you waiting for, Power Ranger?

06:00.977 --> 06:03.060
Go ahead, Steve. Stick it in me.

06:03.061 --> 06:06.541
- Ah...
- Aah! Oh, my God.

06:06.745 --> 06:09.138
I was having the best dream!

06:09.139 --> 06:10.597
I am so screwed.

06:10.598 --> 06:13.689
My sister and her husband are on
their way to Brickleberry right now.

06:13.690 --> 06:14.994
I didn't know you had a sister.

06:14.995 --> 06:17.827
That's because I've been trying
to wish her out of my life.

06:17.828 --> 06:21.749
Psst. Hey, Ethel. For 100 bucks,
I can make that wish come true.

06:21.750 --> 06:26.062
It's been a while since
I fed my dark passenger.

06:26.063 --> 06:29.873
So anyway, my sister makes me crazy.

06:29.874 --> 06:32.642
I mean, our whole lives, she's
always had it better than me.

06:32.643 --> 06:36.746
Congratulations. You're the parents
of a perfect, beautiful baby girl.

06:36.747 --> 06:41.007
And this thing. Uh, should I toss it?

06:42.487 --> 06:45.088
What could we do? Santa loves her more.

06:45.089 --> 06:47.873
You look beautiful, Lucy.

06:47.874 --> 06:51.443
I like vagina.

06:52.089 --> 06:54.988
Oh, she's on your way.
What am I gonna do?

06:54.989 --> 06:57.204
I know. One of you
could pose as my husband.

06:57.205 --> 06:58.593
- Woody?
- No!

06:58.594 --> 07:02.554
- Steve?
- Sorry. Already in love.

07:02.981 --> 07:05.206
Where am I gonna find a husband?

07:05.207 --> 07:10.748
Racist bitch. Treating me like
I'm a Mexican or something.

07:10.749 --> 07:12.961
Where am I gonna find a husband?

07:12.962 --> 07:16.202
Ugh! And I need a kid.

07:16.955 --> 07:19.199
Hey! Psst. Little boy.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.440
Do you want some candy?

07:23.070 --> 07:26.030
- Gotcha!
- Aah! Help, daddy!

07:26.031 --> 07:28.399
Get away from my kid!
What's the matter with you?

07:28.400 --> 07:30.213
I want your son. Bad!

07:30.214 --> 07:31.720
I've got money!

07:31.721 --> 07:34.872
No! Wait! You can join
in and play my husband!

07:34.873 --> 07:36.913
Please.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.109
That's good to see you're dating again.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.976
Welcome to Brickleberry Park.

07:40.977 --> 07:42.452
Thank you.

07:42.453 --> 07:45.430
It's so nice they hire
the mentally challenged.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.150
Not really. I hate them.

07:47.151 --> 07:50.571
Oh, my God, they're here.

07:50.755 --> 07:51.788
What?

07:51.789 --> 07:53.923
Aah! No! No!

07:53.924 --> 07:55.053
No, what are you doing?

07:55.054 --> 07:57.073
Get away from me!

07:57.074 --> 07:59.294
Help! Oh!

08:02.111 --> 08:05.746
Ethel. Oh, my God.
It's so nice to see you.

08:05.747 --> 08:07.711
This must be my nephew.

08:07.712 --> 08:09.952
- You are dead.
- Ugh!

08:09.953 --> 08:12.708
Ugh! Ha, ha, ha.

08:12.709 --> 08:15.817
Little cranky pants didn't have his nap.

08:15.818 --> 08:18.303
I am gonna [Bleep] claw your eyes out!

08:18.304 --> 08:20.449
Tantrums are normal for gifted kids.

08:20.450 --> 08:22.952
I'm not a kid. I'm a wild animal.

08:22.953 --> 08:26.422
And he has such colorful
imagination. Well, and ADHD.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.679
Ow! Go play, honey.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.268
Oh!

08:30.269 --> 08:32.011
Uh, okay.

08:32.013 --> 08:34.914
Now where's that husband you
were telling me so much about?

08:34.916 --> 08:37.481
Uh, yeah. He's... um, ah...

08:37.482 --> 08:40.662
I'm right here, honey.

08:40.681 --> 08:42.712
Hi, I'm Conner.

08:42.714 --> 08:45.894
Ethel's loving husband.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.695
Well, I see Malloy's
calmed down quite a bit.

08:54.696 --> 09:00.596
That's our Malloy. Playful one minute,
a perfectly well-behaved child the next.

09:00.824 --> 09:03.884
I can hear my blood.

09:04.495 --> 09:06.123
He's hypoglycemic.

09:06.124 --> 09:07.976
So, Conner, what do you do for a living?

09:07.977 --> 09:10.166
- Brain surgeon.
- Gynecologist for supermodels.

09:10.167 --> 09:11.267
Well, which is it?

09:11.268 --> 09:16.883
You do brain surgery on gynecologists or
gynecology on supermodel brain surgeons?

09:16.884 --> 09:19.524
I build robots.

09:19.635 --> 09:21.712
So how about those packers this week?

09:21.713 --> 09:24.628
Packers? Football season
doesn't start for five months.

09:24.629 --> 09:27.261
I know. I was talking about the, uh...

09:27.262 --> 09:28.518
Fudge-packers.

09:28.519 --> 09:33.379
Stupid homos want to
get married. Am I right?

09:33.459 --> 09:36.259
Conner! Isn't it time
to get Malloy to school?

09:36.260 --> 09:39.062
Like, right now? It's
a school for the gifted.

09:39.063 --> 09:43.863
- He's a prodigy.
- Num, num, num, num, num.

09:46.570 --> 09:50.230
Oh, I'd love to see his
school. Mind if I tag along?

09:50.231 --> 09:53.585
I don't see why the hell not.

09:53.586 --> 09:55.244
Okay, here we are.
Have a good day, baby.

09:55.245 --> 09:57.105
Ugh.

10:00.951 --> 10:02.918
Hey, look who it is.

10:02.919 --> 10:05.588
It's the new kid.

10:05.589 --> 10:08.330
Hey, new kid. Ugly town called.

10:08.331 --> 10:11.486
You just got voted Mayor.

10:11.487 --> 10:14.313
Oh! Think about how
ugly that means he is.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.623
You're also Mayor of diarrhea town.

10:17.624 --> 10:19.391
- Ooh!
- Aw, snap!

10:19.392 --> 10:21.590
That's the worst town I ever heard of.

10:21.591 --> 10:23.338
My boyfriend is so funny.

10:23.339 --> 10:28.410
This is called a girlfriend.
Something you'll never have.

10:28.411 --> 10:32.081
Either he called him gay or
he's got a fear of commitment.

10:32.082 --> 10:35.725
Listen, buddy. Here's what's gonna
happen. First, I'm gonna take your friends.

10:35.726 --> 10:37.317
Then I'm gonna take your girlfriend.

10:37.318 --> 10:41.131
And when you have nothing
left, I'm going to kill you.

10:41.132 --> 10:45.872
You know what? Think
I'm gonna like school.

10:46.128 --> 10:48.241
As a Park Ranger,
it's pin-port-tint...

10:48.242 --> 10:51.035
Important to know how
to [Bleep] out a fire.

10:51.036 --> 10:52.881
Ah! Put out a fire.

10:52.882 --> 10:54.699
Damn it! I'm gonna
blow it with Stephanie.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.953
Aw, come on. Steve.
Think about what I said.

10:56.954 --> 11:00.608
I don't know, Denzel. Imagining the
audience naked really doesn't work for me.

11:00.609 --> 11:01.909
Just trying to help.

11:01.910 --> 11:03.753
All right, time for plan "B".

11:03.754 --> 11:06.914
I'm gonna pump the kids up for you.
Trust me, it's all about showmanship.

11:06.915 --> 11:10.887
Aw. Thanks, man. Woody? You're
here to help me with my speech too?

11:10.888 --> 11:12.620
What speech? Aah!

11:12.621 --> 11:15.131
Either I drank way too
much last night or...

11:15.132 --> 11:18.072
Or I'm a Werewolf!

11:22.857 --> 11:25.760
So bottom line, I'm gonna
go along with Ethel's charade

11:25.761 --> 11:27.894
long enough to destroy
this bully's life.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.016
Hey, Malloy. I've been there.

11:30.017 --> 11:31.751
I used to get bullied too.

11:31.752 --> 11:35.493
My old man would show up at school,
take the lunch money my mom gave me,

11:35.494 --> 11:37.869
beat the piss out of me
with an extension cord.

11:37.870 --> 11:39.830
Was it humiliating? Sure.

11:39.831 --> 11:40.994
But I showed him.

11:40.995 --> 11:43.692
I started to enjoy the beatings.

11:43.693 --> 11:45.853
Sexually.

11:46.994 --> 11:49.241
Okay. I'm gonna get off your lap now.

11:49.242 --> 11:54.942
Great talk, son. Hey, by the
way, did you get a haircut?

11:56.585 --> 11:58.411
All right, kids. Settle down.

11:58.412 --> 12:02.182
We're about to bring out a
remarkably handsome Park Ranger to...

12:02.183 --> 12:04.707
Zip it, Beav-Steve.
I'll take it from here.

12:04.708 --> 12:05.987
Yo, drop that beat!

12:05.988 --> 12:08.925
♪ Yeah, mother[Bleep]!

12:08.926 --> 12:13.486
It's time to get krunk up in this bitch!

12:13.631 --> 12:15.757
Ass and titties. Ass and titties.

12:15.758 --> 12:17.619
Ass and titties. Ass and titties.

12:17.620 --> 12:19.609
Shake that ass. Drop that ass.

12:19.610 --> 12:21.611
Shake that ass. Drop that ass.

12:21.612 --> 12:23.420
Slide, dip. Slide, dip.

12:23.421 --> 12:27.041
Touch the ground. Doo doo brown!

12:27.042 --> 12:29.862
And here's Steve.

12:31.513 --> 12:33.778
Uh... Okay.

12:33.779 --> 12:36.184
Uh, I'm ran... ranger Steve.

12:36.185 --> 12:39.313
And I-I'm gonna tell you all
about being a Park Ranger.

12:39.314 --> 12:42.955
You look more like a pork ranger.

12:42.956 --> 12:45.326
Oh, snap! He said pork ranger!

12:45.327 --> 12:47.261
That's a play on words, yo!

12:47.262 --> 12:49.230
Uh, okay.

12:49.231 --> 12:54.435
As a... as a ranger,
f-f-fire safety is important.

12:54.436 --> 12:57.152
Forest fires are extremely dangerous.

12:57.153 --> 12:58.739
Is that what [Bleep] your face up?

12:58.740 --> 12:59.730
Ooh.

12:59.731 --> 13:03.444
Oh! New kid dropped an HBO word.

13:03.445 --> 13:05.533
Picture everyone naked.
Picture everyone naked.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.756
- Picture everyone naked.
- Picturing kids naked?

13:07.757 --> 13:10.115
Don't you do enough of that
at home, you pudgy pedophile?

13:10.116 --> 13:12.810
Oh, no! No, no, no, no!

13:12.811 --> 13:16.124
He's saying pork ranger's
a pee-pee toucher.

13:16.125 --> 13:17.985
Aah!

13:20.593 --> 13:22.284
He is the King!

13:22.285 --> 13:24.173
New King!

13:24.174 --> 13:25.667
Got your friends.

13:25.668 --> 13:27.750
That's one. Let's get out of here, baby.

13:27.751 --> 13:29.553
Can't. Play rehearsal.

13:29.554 --> 13:30.839
Play, huh?

13:30.840 --> 13:32.340
Initiate phase two.

13:32.341 --> 13:33.675
Play me out, Denzel.

13:33.676 --> 13:35.311
Ass and titties. Ass and titties.

13:35.312 --> 13:36.990
Hump dem hos, hump dem hos.

13:36.991 --> 13:40.852
Ass and titties. Ass and titties.

13:40.853 --> 13:43.370
Well, Malloy. How was school today?

13:43.371 --> 13:46.046
Not bad. I'm auditioning
for a part in a play.

13:46.047 --> 13:47.121
I don't like plays.

13:47.122 --> 13:51.331
I'm just trying to get in
this girl's guts in my class.

13:51.332 --> 13:53.792
So, Conner...

13:53.897 --> 13:57.925
I'm sure Ethel told you about our
amazing wedding in the Amazon Rain Forest.

13:57.926 --> 14:00.796
That's nothing. We got
married on the moon.

14:00.797 --> 14:03.091
Uh, Moon Palace. Cancun.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.526
It was very pricey.

14:04.527 --> 14:07.108
I thought you said you
got married in Hawaii.

14:07.109 --> 14:09.511
Uh, we had two ceremonies.

14:09.512 --> 14:11.446
They didn't want blacks
at the good wedding.

14:11.447 --> 14:12.821
Right. No!

14:12.822 --> 14:14.423
Mommy's got a temper.

14:14.424 --> 14:16.479
- She beats me.
- At checkers.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.613
- Ethel?
- Who is this?

14:18.614 --> 14:20.397
- Mommy's boyfriend.
- Pardon?

14:20.398 --> 14:22.321
You're married? That's hot.

14:22.322 --> 14:27.117
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, ugh...

14:27.118 --> 14:28.262
I'll call you later.

14:28.263 --> 14:30.059
You better explain yourself, Ethel.

14:30.060 --> 14:31.254
Oh, there's a good...

14:31.255 --> 14:33.201
Oh, you see, what happened...

14:33.202 --> 14:35.079
Aah! You know what?

14:35.080 --> 14:37.080
- I can't lie anymore.
- You're right.

14:37.081 --> 14:38.648
Let's not lie anymore.

14:38.649 --> 14:40.758
This just isn't any ordinary night.

14:40.759 --> 14:42.610
Tonight's our anniversary.

14:42.611 --> 14:45.712
And I'd like to give
something to the woman I love.

14:45.713 --> 14:47.147
Oh, my God.

14:47.148 --> 14:48.479
It's beautiful.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.052
Well, it's just like grandma's necklace.
I thought that was one of a kind.

14:52.053 --> 14:54.073
How did you know I always
wanted one like this?

14:54.074 --> 14:56.490
I stole your diary. I mean, I listen!

14:56.491 --> 14:59.317
Oh, and I found your missing diary.

14:59.318 --> 15:01.296
He's so thoughtful, Ethel.

15:01.297 --> 15:02.670
You've got a good man, there.

15:02.671 --> 15:05.071
Yeah, I do.

15:05.268 --> 15:10.308
Aw. Mommy and daddy are
gonna rub holes tonight.

15:11.507 --> 15:13.436
Well, I wish we could
stay, but you know.

15:13.437 --> 15:15.367
Al Pacino's in a holding pattern.

15:15.368 --> 15:17.090
Lucy, come on. Let's go.

15:17.091 --> 15:19.798
We gotta let these two
lovebirds rub holes.

15:19.799 --> 15:21.996
Oh, well. Back to our normal lives.

15:21.997 --> 15:24.117
I hate our normal lives.

15:24.118 --> 15:26.021
Wait! You can't leave.

15:26.022 --> 15:28.360
You'll miss Malloy's big
part in the play tomorrow.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.869
He had to fill in last minute.

15:29.870 --> 15:34.670
He said something
happened to the lead actor.

15:35.966 --> 15:38.158
Help! Help!

15:38.159 --> 15:39.869
You can just spend the night with us.

15:39.870 --> 15:41.241
Great idea, Conner.

15:41.242 --> 15:43.598
Oh, yes. I'd love to
see my nephew in a play.

15:43.599 --> 15:46.113
- I just adore the theater.
- Well, let's do it.

15:46.114 --> 15:47.435
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

15:47.436 --> 15:50.301
That means I get to sleep
in the bed with Ethel.

15:50.302 --> 15:51.946
Like we always do.

15:51.947 --> 15:53.623
Because we're married.

15:53.624 --> 15:57.400
And we've explored every wet, dark
crevice of each other's bodies.

15:57.401 --> 15:59.201
Ow!

16:01.423 --> 16:03.925
- Good night, you three. Sleep well.
- Good night.

16:03.926 --> 16:07.244
- Uppity bitch.
- Sorry I pulled this on you, Ethel.

16:07.245 --> 16:09.104
I just don't want this to end.

16:09.105 --> 16:10.623
You know what, Connie?

16:10.624 --> 16:14.168
It's okay. You've helped me out so much.

16:14.169 --> 16:16.771
Actually, this is kind of... nice.

16:16.772 --> 16:19.941
I know. I don't think
I've ever been this happy.

16:19.942 --> 16:22.177
You know, in a sad way, me too.

16:22.178 --> 16:27.458
There's only one thing
that could make this better.

16:28.731 --> 16:31.131
Ewe! Connie!

16:31.453 --> 16:32.754
Jesus! What the hell is that?

16:32.755 --> 16:34.997
But I thought we were a real family.

16:34.998 --> 16:37.010
Connie, wake up!

16:37.011 --> 16:38.964
This is not real.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.700
You're a lesbian, and our
child is a shaved bear.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.529
We are nothing like a family.

16:43.530 --> 16:46.155
Pre-Jack Ken would have a better
shot at me than you ever will.

16:46.156 --> 16:47.836
Is everything okay in here?

16:47.837 --> 16:48.954
No.

16:48.955 --> 16:51.422
Ethel, I want a divorce!

16:51.423 --> 16:54.121
- What?
- And I'm taking that necklace back.

16:54.122 --> 16:56.758
- What are you gonna do? Return it?
- Yes, I am.

16:56.759 --> 17:01.600
I'm gonna dig up your grandmother again
and put it back on her [Bleep] neck!

17:01.601 --> 17:04.361
Fine. Wait, what?

17:11.938 --> 17:14.213
I can't believe that you
made us come to this, Woody.

17:14.214 --> 17:16.140
I can't show my face around Stephanie.

17:16.141 --> 17:19.508
Zip it and sit down. It's
my Cubby Wubb's first play.

17:19.509 --> 17:20.642
And you're gonna love it!

17:20.643 --> 17:23.571
Steve, your speech was awesome.

17:23.573 --> 17:26.184
The kids loved it. They
never laughed so hard.

17:26.185 --> 17:28.403
You serious? But I peed my pants.

17:28.404 --> 17:30.054
That was the best part.

17:30.055 --> 17:32.917
I can't tell you how many
kids want to be Rangers now.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.802
Really? How many?

17:34.803 --> 17:37.430
No, I can't tell you. I
didn't ask any of them.

17:37.431 --> 17:41.242
- What should I do, Denzel?
- I know what you should do, buddy.

17:41.243 --> 17:42.631
Go [Bleep] yourself.

17:42.632 --> 17:44.861
Thanks for the kind words, bro.

17:44.862 --> 17:47.378
Con... ner. I'm surprised to...

17:47.379 --> 17:50.349
Save it, Ethel. I'm just
here to support our son.

17:50.350 --> 17:52.153
Oh, there's no shame in divorce.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.625
As long as you don't mind
burning in hell with the queers.

17:54.626 --> 17:57.049
Everything is fine. Right, honey?

17:57.050 --> 17:58.850
Ha.

17:59.098 --> 18:00.607
His tongue is tired.

18:00.608 --> 18:03.128
Tons of oral.

18:04.916 --> 18:07.077
What? No previews?

18:07.078 --> 18:10.438
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

18:10.588 --> 18:12.500
How did he get in the play?

18:12.501 --> 18:14.431
What happened to Jeremy?

18:14.432 --> 18:16.652
Aah! Aah!

18:16.717 --> 18:18.339
Aah!

18:18.340 --> 18:21.265
Whew. Well, at least the water stopped.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.066
No!

18:24.445 --> 18:27.625
Denzel, make it happen.

18:33.904 --> 18:37.706
This should put a little
hot sauce on your taco.

18:37.707 --> 18:39.507
Uh.

18:40.910 --> 18:43.771
You can look, but you can't touch.

18:43.772 --> 18:45.513
You like that?

18:45.514 --> 18:47.357
I bet you like this sweet ass.

18:47.358 --> 18:49.218
Ugh!

18:52.242 --> 18:54.102
Mmm.

18:56.524 --> 18:58.645
Got your girl. That's two.

18:58.646 --> 19:01.839
Magic Malloy stole your lady!

19:01.840 --> 19:04.300
Get off her!

19:06.011 --> 19:07.640
Uh oh.

19:07.641 --> 19:10.032
Aah! Ow, ow, ow!

19:10.033 --> 19:11.833
Ow!

19:12.484 --> 19:14.344
Aah!

19:14.586 --> 19:16.585
- Run!
- This play's awesome.

19:16.586 --> 19:17.955
No! No!

19:17.956 --> 19:20.228
Everyone, please calm down.

19:20.229 --> 19:22.575
Malloy, break it up!

19:22.576 --> 19:24.976
- Ah!
- Oh!

19:27.466 --> 19:29.968
Here comes three.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.602
Ow!

19:31.603 --> 19:33.371
Ow! Help!

19:33.372 --> 19:35.952
Encore! Encore!

19:40.761 --> 19:43.915
Turn it off! Turn it off!

19:43.916 --> 19:45.951
Sorry my boobs popped out, Ethel.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.155
Ethel, I can't believe you lied to me.

19:48.156 --> 19:51.522
This is the sorriest excuse
for a family I've ever seen.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.091
You'd be lucky to have a
family as great as this.

19:54.092 --> 19:56.943
- Do you really mean that, Ethel?
- Probably not, Connie.

19:56.944 --> 20:00.559
Aw, that is sweet...
how pathetic you are.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.498
- Talk to you never.
- You're gonna let her get away with that?

20:03.499 --> 20:09.399
You know, Malloy, sometimes it's
better just to be the bigger person.
