WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:02.365
You wanna hire me?
To help me find my dad.

00:02.436 --> 00:05.701
I'd give anything to see my dad again,
Mr. Magnum, anything.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.642
The little guy
in this picture is Dan Wolf.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.042
Now, all he's asking for
is an afternoon.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.377
Hey, look. He didn't talk to me,
and I didn't talk to him.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.143
I'm sorry,
I can't help you out.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.980
Watch out!

00:18.052 --> 00:19.314
You're gonna go after him,
aren't you?

00:19.387 --> 00:20.479
T.C.: Why are you doing this?

00:20.554 --> 00:22.249
Why don't you
let the police handle it?

00:22.323 --> 00:25.690
Why don't we just turn around?
I don't think anybody's here.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.057
Let her go!

00:27.495 --> 00:28.519
Wait!

02:32.800 --> 02:34.165
Mr. Hagen?

02:34.468 --> 02:35.730
Sir, sir.

02:42.843 --> 02:44.310
Mr. Hagen,

02:44.378 --> 02:46.505
is it true you've been granted
immunity for your testimony?

02:46.580 --> 02:47.569
No comment.

02:47.648 --> 02:49.980
Will any charges be added to the
indictment? We have no comment.

02:50.050 --> 02:51.711
Now back off, people.
You're obstructing.

02:51.786 --> 02:55.222
Excuse me, sir, any comment on the allegation
that you took part in some of that...

02:55.523 --> 02:56.581
Let's go.

02:58.993 --> 03:02.258
All right, if everyone will calm
down, we'll give you a statement. Okay?

03:02.329 --> 03:06.129
Now, the District Attorney's Office has
determined that our client, Mr. Hagen,

03:06.200 --> 03:09.601
can provide evidence which may or
may not have a significant impact

03:09.670 --> 03:10.932
in the outcome of this case.

03:11.005 --> 03:14.805
In the event that our client's
testimony provides the DA with the basis

03:14.875 --> 03:19.039
to prove the claims in this indictment,
Mr. Hagen will be given full immunity.

03:20.948 --> 03:24.509
Down! Everybody, down!
Get out of the way! Move, run!

03:29.924 --> 03:32.392
Get out of the way!

03:41.335 --> 03:44.463
The tension mounted,
and the crowd was going wild,

03:45.072 --> 03:48.667
as the hometown hero
stepped to the plate.

03:49.910 --> 03:51.639
The game depended on him.

03:52.379 --> 03:55.473
The town depended on him.
And he knew he could do it,

03:56.484 --> 04:00.443
if only this time
he didn't lose his nerve.

04:00.754 --> 04:01.846
If only this time...

04:01.922 --> 04:03.856
Hey, batter batter
batter batter.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.289
Easy out. Let's go.

04:06.494 --> 04:09.088
If only this time
he wasn't intimidated

04:09.630 --> 04:13.657
by the cold, steely gaze
of the pitcher.

04:18.439 --> 04:21.636
Strike one!
Keep him swinging.

04:25.679 --> 04:28.147
Hey, batter batter
batter batter!

04:30.718 --> 04:32.117
Strike two!

04:32.620 --> 04:35.054
Send that bum
back to the minors!

04:36.991 --> 04:41.655
And suddenly he knew that this
time it would be different.

04:44.398 --> 04:45.387
Ha!

04:59.880 --> 05:01.848
I warned you not to pull.

05:01.916 --> 05:04.817
Don't underestimate the power of
the machine. That's what I told you.

05:04.885 --> 05:07.547
I know what you told me. I just got
a little carried away, that's all.

05:07.621 --> 05:09.714
Yeah? Well, you'd better help
me carry this one into the van

05:09.790 --> 05:11.087
before Higgins comes out
and...

05:11.158 --> 05:14.616
Magnum! Magnum!

05:16.297 --> 05:19.130
I'll stall him.
You get rid of Dwight Gooden, here.

05:22.403 --> 05:24.496
Higgins,
I can explain everything.

05:25.573 --> 05:27.837
It all started when I
was in the fourth grade.

05:27.908 --> 05:30.274
That was the year my uncle Jim
managed our Little League team.

05:30.344 --> 05:32.938
We had this real big game,
and we were down by one run.

05:33.013 --> 05:36.141
It was two out, bottom of the ninth,
two men on, and I was at bat.

05:36.216 --> 05:38.013
Casey at the Bat,
by Ernest Lawrence Thayer.

05:38.085 --> 05:39.245
No. Me in Tidewater.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.289
I'm not interest in hearing any
touching tales of childhood baseball

05:42.356 --> 05:44.881
until we determine who is going to
pay for the broken window, and how.

05:44.959 --> 05:47.018
I think once I explain
how this all came about...

05:47.094 --> 05:49.562
I don't care how it all came about.
All I care about,

05:49.630 --> 05:51.427
you're not leaving here
until this matter is settled!

05:51.498 --> 05:52.624
Higgins, it's nobody's
fault, really!

05:52.700 --> 05:53.928
Get out of
the van immediately.

05:54.001 --> 05:55.468
Excuse me.
Did you hear me?

05:55.536 --> 05:58.096
Excuse me. Dan Wolf,
Futurity Life lnsurance.

05:58.172 --> 06:00.106
I am not interested
in life insurance. Good day.

06:00.174 --> 06:01.232
Excuse me,
you don't understand.

06:01.308 --> 06:04.471
Let me put it another way.
The answer is no. Move along, please.

06:04.545 --> 06:07.776
Are you Thomas Magnum?
Certainly not.

06:08.248 --> 06:11.012
I'm Thomas Magnum.
You're late, what kept you?

06:11.518 --> 06:14.510
I beg your pardon?
What are we talking about here?

06:15.623 --> 06:16.612
Magnum!

06:17.057 --> 06:18.081
MAGNUM:... annuities, what?

06:18.158 --> 06:19.591
Rick! T.C.!

06:20.461 --> 06:24.295
Well, there's this whole line
of options that we can go over.

06:24.365 --> 06:25.354
Magnum!

06:32.473 --> 06:36.000
Now the big bonus for you here
is that any of these policies

06:36.076 --> 06:39.375
can be rolled over into a completely
different package at any time,

06:39.446 --> 06:41.710
depending on your own personal
insurance needs, of course.

06:41.782 --> 06:43.477
And that's an important point
to keep in mind

06:43.550 --> 06:44.847
when you're thinking
about insurance,

06:44.918 --> 06:47.819
because not every insurance company
deals in that kind of thing.

06:47.888 --> 06:49.583
That's okay.
Of course, it is.

06:49.657 --> 06:51.022
Now, what I'd like to do
is kind of go over

06:51.091 --> 06:53.457
some of the options
we were talking about.

06:53.527 --> 06:55.119
Well, uh, that's okay.

06:56.063 --> 06:57.894
See, to tell you
the truth,

06:57.965 --> 07:00.160
I don't need
any insurance right now.

07:00.467 --> 07:01.832
What am I doing?

07:03.237 --> 07:07.105
I didn't come here to push some
insurance policy off on you.

07:07.174 --> 07:10.109
I understand.
I mean, that's your job.

07:10.177 --> 07:12.975
But, see, that was kind of an
awkward situation out there.

07:13.047 --> 07:16.346
It's a long story,
but you really helped me get out of it.

07:16.684 --> 07:20.313
But I really don't need
any insurance right now.

07:20.954 --> 07:22.046
How about a beer?

07:22.122 --> 07:23.316
No. Thanks.

07:23.390 --> 07:24.652
Do you mind
if I have one?

07:24.825 --> 07:26.850
Please, go help yourself.

07:29.129 --> 07:33.065
You know, I come all the way
from Des Moines to Honolulu,

07:33.133 --> 07:36.569
track down a good private investigator,
and still I can't stop myself

07:36.637 --> 07:39.697
from trying to sell him
an insurance policy.

07:39.773 --> 07:42.742
Well, you didn't come all the way
from Des Moines to sell me insurance.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.402
No, no. Of course not.

07:45.112 --> 07:47.945
You know, I don't know
where my head is sometimes.

07:48.582 --> 07:50.015
I guess
that's one of the reasons

07:50.084 --> 07:52.780
why I'm salesman of the month
at Futurity, huh?

07:53.387 --> 07:56.788
I hire someone to help me with the
most important thing in my life,

07:56.857 --> 07:59.018
and all I can think about is
trying to make another sale.

07:59.093 --> 08:00.583
You wanna hire me?

08:02.663 --> 08:04.392
To help me to find my dad.

08:05.699 --> 08:08.190
You see, I haven't seen him
since I was three years old.

08:08.268 --> 08:10.668
Come on over here,
sit down, bring your beer,

08:10.771 --> 08:13.035
and I'll tell you
all about it.

08:17.244 --> 08:21.442
Now, this is my dad,
Theo Wolf.

08:23.083 --> 08:27.019
Now, this picture right here, this was the
last one taken of him before he left home.

08:27.087 --> 08:29.817
My mother and l,
we never saw him again after that.

08:29.890 --> 08:32.289
Doesn't look like he was too keen
on getting his picture taken.

08:32.359 --> 08:35.919
No. No. My mom, she said that he
was always kind of self-conscious

08:35.996 --> 08:37.258
about that sort of thing.

08:37.331 --> 08:39.356
Well, I mean,
it doesn't matter.

08:39.433 --> 08:42.129
Even if you had a better picture,
he'd be a lot older now.

08:42.202 --> 08:45.365
52. He just had a birthday
a little while back.

08:48.275 --> 08:52.336
It's funny, I never thought I'd be
looking for him. I really didn't.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.170
But, my mom...

08:57.484 --> 08:59.384
She passed away last year.

08:59.453 --> 09:00.715
I'm sorry.

09:00.788 --> 09:02.187
Oh, that's no...

09:05.125 --> 09:06.285
Anyway,

09:07.995 --> 09:10.327
after the funeral,
Jolene, she...

09:10.597 --> 09:13.361
Jolene, she's an old friend
of the family, you know.

09:13.433 --> 09:15.901
She told me what she could
have never told my mom

09:15.969 --> 09:17.163
when she was alive.

09:17.237 --> 09:20.695
She told me she knew for
a fact Theo was in Hawaii.

09:20.774 --> 09:24.301
I mean, she actually ran into him
while she was on vacation here.

09:24.478 --> 09:27.777
"Hawaii?" I said. I mean,
what do l know about Hawaii?

09:28.448 --> 09:29.881
"Oahu," she says.

09:31.084 --> 09:32.881
I say, "Gesundheit."

09:34.688 --> 09:38.954
Dan, I don't think you really need me.
Oahu's not that big.

09:39.059 --> 09:41.186
If he's here,
you should be able to find him yourself.

09:41.261 --> 09:45.322
Now, he's not listed on Oahu, or any of
the other islands, as far as that goes.

09:45.532 --> 09:46.658
But...

09:49.036 --> 09:50.264
She is.

09:52.072 --> 09:53.198
"Kim Nakamura."

09:53.273 --> 09:57.300
Yeah. See, apparently she was with
my dad when Jolene ran into him.

09:57.544 --> 10:00.638
Now, he introduced her as a business
associate, or something like that,

10:00.714 --> 10:04.047
but then he rushed off like he was
making a big mistake by talking to her.

10:04.117 --> 10:05.846
I mean, he was
real suspicious with Jolene.

10:05.919 --> 10:08.479
Now, she jotted down
that name, just in case.

10:09.223 --> 10:13.091
Well, that's it. I mean,
that's my only lead, that...

10:13.760 --> 10:17.287
I spent so many years
being angry at my dad

10:17.364 --> 10:20.128
for just up and walking out
on us the way he did.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.067
I mean, I never thought I'd
wanna see him again, ever.

10:23.136 --> 10:25.127
But then, after Mom died...

10:27.074 --> 10:29.474
I guess I just realized
it wasn't true.

10:31.979 --> 10:34.777
I'd give anything to see my dad again,
Mr. Magnum.

10:38.418 --> 10:40.818
I mean, even if
it was just for one hour.

10:45.225 --> 10:47.625
I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.

10:47.694 --> 10:50.094
Dan Wolf didn't need
a private investigator.

10:50.163 --> 10:53.599
He could as easily have tracked
down Kim Nakamura as I could.

10:53.734 --> 10:57.170
So why was he back at my place
eating my pizza, drinking my beer,

10:57.237 --> 11:00.400
while I was on my way to have
a talk with the mystery lady?

11:00.474 --> 11:02.499
There are a lot of reasons
I could've come up with,

11:02.576 --> 11:04.009
Iike taking an easy case
for a change,

11:04.077 --> 11:06.875
Iike being able to pay for
the window I'd just broken.

11:06.947 --> 11:08.642
Those were good reasons.

11:09.049 --> 11:11.074
But they weren't
the real reason.

11:11.818 --> 11:14.719
The real reason had something
to do with a young boy

11:14.788 --> 11:18.485
wanting to spend even one hour,
just one more hour,

11:18.558 --> 11:20.651
with his father
who had gone away.

11:21.161 --> 11:23.425
He was Ku, the war god,

11:24.264 --> 11:26.562
but he had many names,
and many aspects.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.528
I thought all this
early Hawaiian stuff

11:28.602 --> 11:30.900
was tucked away in museums
and private collections?

11:30.971 --> 11:32.871
This is a private collection.

11:33.473 --> 11:34.599
On the open market?

11:34.675 --> 11:36.336
No, only the paintings.

11:36.877 --> 11:39.471
Oh, so the artifacts
are the bait,

11:39.546 --> 11:41.207
and the paintings, the hook?

11:41.281 --> 11:43.010
Congratulations,
Mr. Magnum.

11:43.083 --> 11:45.517
You've just discovered
our marketing strategy.

11:45.585 --> 11:46.984
Who owns the mask?

11:47.888 --> 11:50.755
Was there a particular
painting that interested you?

11:51.525 --> 11:54.756
Well, actually,
I was more interested in the owner of...

11:54.828 --> 11:58.025
The owner, like the collection,
wishes to remain private.

11:59.900 --> 12:02.300
His name wouldn't be
Theo Wolf, would it?

12:02.869 --> 12:06.202
The little guy
in this picture is Dan Wolf.

12:07.574 --> 12:11.840
He's grown up now, but he hasn't seen
his father since that picture was taken.

12:12.079 --> 12:15.537
Now, all he's asking for
is an afternoon,

12:15.615 --> 12:18.914
Iong enough to shake hands
and swap a few stories.

12:26.226 --> 12:29.218
Okay, just follow the driveway
round to the garden room

12:29.296 --> 12:30.593
just behind the house.

12:30.664 --> 12:34.725
Mr. Magnum? Photograph?
Don't forget to show him the photograph.

12:44.211 --> 12:47.044
I've worked very hard
to keep a low profile.

12:51.752 --> 12:55.017
Not many people know
where I live, Mr...

12:56.323 --> 12:57.347
Magnum.

12:58.925 --> 13:00.825
I'd like to keep it that way.

13:01.962 --> 13:05.363
Well, I don't think your son
wants to take out any ads.

13:05.432 --> 13:06.922
He just wants to see you.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.491
What makes you so sure
he's my son, Magnum?

13:22.015 --> 13:23.141
Oh, boy.

13:25.652 --> 13:27.586
This was one of the good days.

13:28.288 --> 13:29.915
One of those
few and far between,

13:29.990 --> 13:33.187
when Danny's mother and I
weren't fighting about something.

13:34.327 --> 13:36.386
We were at the lake, I think.

13:36.997 --> 13:40.865
I wanted a good picture, you know,
a good picture holding Danny.

13:43.570 --> 13:45.936
Daddy! Daddy!
I don't wanna take a nap.

13:46.006 --> 13:47.473
Hey, big boy.

13:47.941 --> 13:49.772
Tell Mommy
I don't have to take a nap.

13:49.843 --> 13:51.572
Well, my goodness.

13:52.746 --> 13:56.705
I'm sorry, Theo I didn't mean for
him to burst in on you like this.

13:56.883 --> 13:58.817
It's all right,
it's all right.

13:59.619 --> 14:03.316
I'll tell you what. Why don't
you go do what your mommy wants?

14:03.390 --> 14:05.722
I'll see you later, okay?

14:09.196 --> 14:10.788
The photograph, is it...

14:12.099 --> 14:13.760
Yeah, it's Danny.

14:23.376 --> 14:24.968
Perhaps it's time.

14:32.953 --> 14:35.080
I didn't realize
she was your wife.

14:35.989 --> 14:36.978
Yeah.

14:39.392 --> 14:42.293
I had a lot of reasons
to leave the Mainland, Magnum.

14:42.362 --> 14:45.854
Even so, I was very lonely here,
for a long time.

14:46.733 --> 14:49.861
Then with Kim and the baby,

14:49.936 --> 14:52.302
I suddenly found myself
with a new life.

14:53.073 --> 14:56.440
I almost convinced myself that
the old Theo had never existed,

14:58.845 --> 15:00.437
and neither had Danny.

15:02.616 --> 15:04.675
Well, he's outside in the car.

15:05.519 --> 15:09.182
He wanted to come along and wait,
just in case you wanted to see him.

15:23.837 --> 15:27.295
There's a young man waiting in
the car out there. Show him in.

15:27.374 --> 15:31.936
And for God's sake,
show him some respect. He's my son.

16:07.681 --> 16:08.670
Danny?

16:24.464 --> 16:25.453
Theo!

16:41.391 --> 16:43.325
BP is 130 over 80
and holding.

16:43.398 --> 16:45.992
Respiration and vital signs are steady.
He's on Ringer's lactate.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.159
Type and
cross-match done?

16:47.235 --> 16:48.896
Yes, sir.

16:58.213 --> 17:01.239
All right, steady now, here we go.
Easy, come on, come on.

17:01.316 --> 17:03.216
Okay,
let's get the monitors on him.

17:03.585 --> 17:05.246
D5W standing by.

17:05.319 --> 17:07.810
Stand by, plasma.
Six units post-op.

17:08.455 --> 17:10.549
Cardio sigmagraph
insert complete.

17:13.962 --> 17:16.089
BP's holding
at 130 over 80.

17:16.196 --> 17:21.099
130 to 80 may have appeared to be
insurmountable odds to any ordinary regiment,

17:21.202 --> 17:24.603
but they weren't counting on the
Prince of Wales' own West Yorkshire.

17:24.672 --> 17:28.199
I was quite familiar with the
workings of the Himmelbett, and l...

17:29.477 --> 17:30.603
Magnum?

17:30.678 --> 17:31.702
What's the blood
pressure?

17:31.779 --> 17:33.770
BP's stable.
Heart rate's 100.

17:33.848 --> 17:36.043
Check the hematocrit.
He may be overcompensating.

17:36.117 --> 17:39.382
Hey, Thomas,
you're overcompensating again.

17:39.587 --> 17:42.613
You see, you gotta let the dames
come to you just once in a while.

17:42.690 --> 17:44.715
You know what I mean,
sweetheart?

17:45.927 --> 17:49.590
Confirming the entrance wound two
centimeters below the collar bone.

17:50.298 --> 17:51.822
BP's holding at 130.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.336
And I have to be there by 3:00
or else we'll never get the continuance.

17:56.604 --> 17:57.628
What a day
for my car to conk out.

17:57.705 --> 18:00.833
I don't know what I would have
done if you hadn't shown up.

18:00.909 --> 18:02.968
Promise me you'll never
move away from here.

18:03.044 --> 18:06.104
Cardiac arrest. Get the crash cart.

18:06.181 --> 18:07.546
All clear!

18:09.517 --> 18:12.179
T.C.: You're not gonna
duck out on me like this,

18:12.253 --> 18:15.916
'cause you made me a promise,
and you're gonna keep it.

18:15.990 --> 18:18.982
You're doing fine,
Thomas! Get me some adrenalin.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.620
Here's 10 cc's of
adrenalin, 1 to 10,000.

18:21.963 --> 18:24.295
All right, Thomas.
Hang in there.

18:31.806 --> 18:34.400
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?

18:36.778 --> 18:37.767
No.

18:39.514 --> 18:41.243
I didn't sleep at all.

18:42.650 --> 18:44.311
I'm in a hospital?

18:44.419 --> 18:48.719
Yeah, since yesterday. Don't get
excited. You're going to be fine.

18:52.660 --> 18:54.287
Thirsty.

18:54.395 --> 18:56.386
I'll give you some ice.

18:56.864 --> 18:58.024
Just a bit.

19:04.572 --> 19:05.937
Okay.

19:16.184 --> 19:18.118
How long do I have to be here?

19:19.387 --> 19:20.479
I've got a visitor for you,

19:20.555 --> 19:22.955
but you don't have to talk to
him unless you feel up to it.

19:23.024 --> 19:26.619
Magnum, what do you remember
about the shooting?

19:32.667 --> 19:36.501
Oh, hi, Lieutenant.
It's nice to see you, too.

19:37.272 --> 19:40.332
Dr. Ibold says I'm gonna be fine.
Thanks for asking.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.673
Do I have to ask?
A big, strong guy like you?

19:44.312 --> 19:46.780
You could at least
go through the motions

19:47.482 --> 19:48.676
before we talk business.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.150
You gonna make it,
Magnum?

19:51.919 --> 19:54.888
Dr. Ibold says I'm gonna be fine.
Thanks for asking.

19:55.590 --> 19:57.353
Tell me about your client.

20:00.295 --> 20:02.525
He said his name was Dan Wolf,

20:03.298 --> 20:05.823
an insurance salesman
from Des Moines.

20:06.768 --> 20:09.259
He said Theo Wolf
was his long-lost father.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.273
Stalking horse.

20:15.710 --> 20:17.075
What?

20:18.713 --> 20:20.977
He used me
as a stalking horse,

20:22.150 --> 20:26.951
so he could get close to Wolf
without anybody checking him out.

20:31.893 --> 20:33.451
Did you get him?

20:34.095 --> 20:37.792
He used your car to get away.
We found it in an alleyway downtown.

20:38.032 --> 20:41.160
It's clean. No prints.
No trace of him.

20:41.536 --> 20:44.027
All we've got
are two dead guys,

20:44.505 --> 20:48.134
a clean getaway car,
four rounds from the murder weapon,

20:49.410 --> 20:50.741
and you.

20:55.516 --> 20:57.245
If you remember anything...

22:49.363 --> 22:51.763
You ought to get
a tennis ball.

22:52.467 --> 22:54.492
Bring that grip back
in no time.

22:54.836 --> 22:56.633
I've seen guys lose a hand.

22:56.804 --> 22:59.898
Tennis ball makes the other
hand just twice as strong.

23:00.575 --> 23:02.270
Tennis ball, right.
Yeah.

23:02.844 --> 23:05.438
Oh, you...
You're wondering why I'm here?

23:05.746 --> 23:09.273
No. Well, yes.
I'm glad to see you, but...

23:09.350 --> 23:13.013
Ethics, Magnum.
Nobody knows about ethics no more.

23:13.688 --> 23:17.920
In the old days, there would never be this
kind of garbage, where everybody gets hit.

23:17.992 --> 23:22.088
The guy that got hit, he got hit,
that's all. Not everybody around him.

23:22.163 --> 23:23.653
There's no ethics.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.494
I know you didn't come here
just to talk to me about ethics.

23:29.570 --> 23:33.506
No, I didn't, no.
Oh, just let me talk.

23:34.408 --> 23:36.342
All you have to do is listen.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.342
Now, the hitter's name
is Driscoll.

23:43.417 --> 23:44.406
Yeah.

23:44.886 --> 23:48.413
He's new in the business,
looking to make a name for himself.

23:49.023 --> 23:53.960
Now, he took on a contract that nobody's
been able to fulfill for 10 years.

23:54.996 --> 23:56.361
Now, Theo Wolf...

23:58.099 --> 24:00.932
He's been a mark ever since
he did a job in Miami.

24:01.102 --> 24:02.160
Who's Dan Wolf?

24:02.370 --> 24:05.066
He's an insurance salesman
from Des Moines.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.334
He hasn't seen his father
since he was three years old,

24:07.408 --> 24:08.670
and he doesn't
wanna see him.

24:08.743 --> 24:12.406
However, two weeks ago,
he reported a burglary.

24:12.480 --> 24:16.610
You know, silver, jewels,
and the family photo albums.

24:17.818 --> 24:19.479
You slowed Driscoll down.

24:19.554 --> 24:22.250
He's holed up from
a bullet you put in his arm.

24:23.424 --> 24:25.153
Here's the name of the hotel.

24:25.226 --> 24:28.389
Now, the desk clerk there,
his name's Cappie, he called me.

24:28.529 --> 24:32.021
Now, he thinks that Driscoll is
gonna take an afternoon flight,

24:32.466 --> 24:35.731
the late one,
to Los Angeles, today.

24:41.108 --> 24:43.133
Kim Nakamura and her son...

24:43.911 --> 24:47.472
She didn't blame you for this.
He just outsmarted you, that's all.

24:50.918 --> 24:53.148
Now, do you want this,
or don't you?

24:55.323 --> 24:56.984
Why are you doing this?

24:58.259 --> 24:59.453
Ethics.

24:59.794 --> 25:03.355
That piece of dirt,

25:05.733 --> 25:07.394
he hit a friend of mine.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.226
Theo?

25:09.804 --> 25:11.772
I didn't know Theo Wolf.

25:18.646 --> 25:20.011
You never saw me.

25:41.435 --> 25:43.164
T.C.: Let me know one thing,
now, how are we gonna

25:43.237 --> 25:44.898
get all this stuff
past the nurses' station?

25:44.972 --> 25:48.203
Don't worry about it.
I told you, I took care of it.

25:50.277 --> 25:51.869
Hey, Thomas, we're here.

25:51.979 --> 25:55.642
Look alive, T.M., we're here
with the supplies.

25:56.584 --> 25:57.983
Huh.

25:58.619 --> 25:59.643
Tom?

26:02.957 --> 26:04.891
Guess he went out
for a walk.

26:07.028 --> 26:09.519
Thank you very much.
Have a nice trip.

26:10.197 --> 26:12.097
WOMAN OVER P.A.:
Now boarding Flight 26 to Los Angeles.

26:12.166 --> 26:13.690
Give me this bag,
please, sir.

26:13.768 --> 26:15.030
Yeah, sure.

26:17.672 --> 26:19.299
Any fruits, vegetables?

26:22.076 --> 26:23.737
Sir, any fruits, plants?

27:26.989 --> 27:28.718
Hey, Thomas,
what happened to you?

27:28.791 --> 27:32.352
When I find you, you're gonna
have some explaining to do, pally.

27:39.168 --> 27:40.863
What are you doing here?

27:42.438 --> 27:44.929
That's exactly
what I was gonna ask you.

27:47.543 --> 27:49.374
Came to pick up some things.

27:52.915 --> 27:56.146
What do you need that they
don't have at the hospital?

27:59.354 --> 28:02.551
I thought you and Rick would be at
the club, watching the playoffs.

28:02.624 --> 28:06.390
No. We went
to visit a sick friend.

28:07.229 --> 28:08.560
We were gonna play
a little joke on him,

28:08.630 --> 28:12.566
bring him some of his favorite junk
food, but it seems the joke was on us.

28:13.001 --> 28:16.368
Well, I can't stay in one room too long.
I get claustrophobic.

28:16.505 --> 28:17.529
Since when?

28:17.606 --> 28:20.837
I can't stay at the hospital
right now, T.C.

28:21.710 --> 28:24.110
You're gonna go
after him, aren't you?

28:25.280 --> 28:27.009
Look at you.
Why are you doing this?

28:27.082 --> 28:29.380
Why don't you
let the police handle it?

28:29.752 --> 28:31.947
So a guy tricked you, so what?

28:32.187 --> 28:35.452
Is your pride so wounded that you're
willing to risk your life to go after him?

28:35.524 --> 28:37.116
Pride's got nothing
to do with it.

28:37.192 --> 28:38.716
Oh, no?
Then, what is this?

28:38.794 --> 28:40.694
A five-year-old kid would
have a father right now

28:40.763 --> 28:44.722
if I hadn't convinced Theo Wolf to meet
with a guy who was out to kill him.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.193
You can't blame yourself
for that.

28:49.671 --> 28:52.572
All right, what makes you
think this guy is still here?

28:52.641 --> 28:54.108
I've seen him!

28:55.244 --> 28:56.302
And he's seen me.

28:56.378 --> 29:00.075
And he's not gonna leave till he
can be sure I can't identify him.

29:00.682 --> 29:01.944
Call Tanaka.

29:02.651 --> 29:03.777
I already have.

29:03.852 --> 29:05.444
He knows as much
as I know.

29:05.521 --> 29:07.512
Good,
then he'll find him.

29:11.460 --> 29:14.258
You're gonna open that wound again,
aren't you?

29:16.398 --> 29:18.332
You're not up to this, Thomas.

29:29.645 --> 29:31.579
You simply cannot
go after him.

29:36.785 --> 29:40.915
I never said I was. I'm just
looking for a change of location,

29:40.989 --> 29:43.787
change of scenery,
till I can recuperate, that's all.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.801
I have an emergency flight
to Maui.

30:01.777 --> 30:06.111
Will you please leave me a number
where I can find you when I get back?

30:13.956 --> 30:17.084
There are some things you'd
think you'd never get used to in life,

30:17.159 --> 30:19.525
Iike being lied to,
or being shot.

30:20.329 --> 30:22.957
But I'd noticed, over the years, that,
left to its own devices,

30:23.031 --> 30:27.593
the mind has an amazing capacity
to accept the unacceptable.

30:28.503 --> 30:31.063
And I never wanted
to let that happen to me,

30:31.473 --> 30:34.033
at least not without
putting up a good fight.

30:35.410 --> 30:38.709
I was determined to follow Ice Pick's
lead as far as it would take me,

30:38.780 --> 30:41.613
which, at first, seemed
to be down a dead-end road.

30:41.683 --> 30:44.049
Driscoll had checked out of the hotel,
and Cappie, the desk clerk

30:44.119 --> 30:47.247
who'd turned him in to Ice Pick,
had suddenly disappeared.

30:48.624 --> 30:50.854
I decided to check into the
room where Driscoll had stayed

30:50.926 --> 30:53.121
to see if he'd been sloppy,

30:53.462 --> 30:56.590
Ieft anything behind that
might turn me in his direction.

31:57.626 --> 31:59.059
Dan?

32:03.031 --> 32:04.020
Yeah?

32:06.234 --> 32:07.223
Wait!

32:25.053 --> 32:26.315
Wait a minute,
will you?

32:26.388 --> 32:27.878
Leave me alone!

32:30.192 --> 32:31.489
Let go of me!

32:32.828 --> 32:34.557
I'm not gonna hurt you.

32:37.966 --> 32:39.763
I just wanna talk to you.

32:41.937 --> 32:42.926
Please.

32:47.376 --> 32:49.276
French fries and coffee?

32:50.779 --> 32:52.337
You sure that's
all you want?

32:52.414 --> 32:54.245
Uh-huh.

32:56.551 --> 33:01.113
Listen, if you could
just give me some idea

33:01.189 --> 33:04.522
where Dan went,
it really means a lot to me.

33:05.727 --> 33:07.627
I thought he was still there.

33:08.497 --> 33:11.364
I wouldn't have gone back
if I thought he was gone.

33:14.836 --> 33:17.134
You can eat that cheeseburger,
if you want.

33:17.205 --> 33:19.002
I'm not really that hungry.

33:26.481 --> 33:29.644
Listen, I'm not saying
that he told you

33:29.718 --> 33:31.583
where he was going
in so many words,

33:31.653 --> 33:34.451
but, see, I mean, you said you
brought him food and cigarettes,

33:34.523 --> 33:36.514
you must've talked to him
about the neighborhood,

33:36.591 --> 33:39.389
where a guy could go
to hang out if he needed to.

33:40.328 --> 33:42.819
What happened
to your shoulder, huh?

33:47.035 --> 33:49.833
Hey, look, he didn't talk to me,
and I didn't talk to him.

33:49.905 --> 33:52.430
All I know about him
is his name's Dan.

33:52.507 --> 33:54.441
I'm sorry,
I can't help you out.

33:54.543 --> 33:55.737
Sure you can.

33:56.511 --> 33:59.036
You can help me
eat all that food I ordered.

34:03.085 --> 34:04.450
No appetite.

34:18.333 --> 34:21.199
After the first time
I was wounded in Vietnam,

34:21.268 --> 34:25.763
I'd noticed a weird, familiar
series of reactions to being shot.

34:26.408 --> 34:28.638
I wondered if anybody'd
ever written them down,

34:28.710 --> 34:31.235
Iike Elizabeth Kubler-Ross'
stages of death.

34:32.414 --> 34:33.938
First there's denial,

34:34.616 --> 34:36.708
then comes
a giddy kind of relief,

34:37.219 --> 34:39.949
shock and surprise
at still being alive,

34:42.056 --> 34:44.456
all the senses working
in Technicolor and hi-fi

34:44.525 --> 34:46.824
at the joy of
actually having survived.

34:49.164 --> 34:52.360
And then the paranoia sets in.

34:55.937 --> 34:58.405
It's happened once,
it could happen again.

35:38.914 --> 35:41.280
Suddenly every sound
is an approaching enemy,

35:41.349 --> 35:43.442
every smell a lethal gas,

35:43.818 --> 35:47.652
and no way of knowing if it's a mind
game, or a clear and present danger.

35:48.256 --> 35:51.453
And no way of stopping the heart
from racing, the palms from sweating,

35:51.526 --> 35:55.462
until the paranoia stage
has slipped into revenge.

35:55.864 --> 35:57.627
Don't shoot, it's me!

35:57.966 --> 35:59.490
What the hell
are you doing here?

35:59.568 --> 36:00.967
I'll leave you alone.
I didn't mean nothing.

36:01.036 --> 36:02.469
It's all right.
It's all right.

36:02.537 --> 36:04.528
I thought
you were someone else.

36:04.906 --> 36:07.238
Don't you know it's dangerous
to sneak up on people...

36:07.309 --> 36:08.742
Watch out!

36:09.978 --> 36:11.036
It's Driscoll.

36:11.112 --> 36:12.943
Stay right here.

36:44.479 --> 36:45.468
Mommy!

37:01.763 --> 37:03.492
Mommy! Mommy!

37:07.435 --> 37:09.164
Driscoll!

37:13.940 --> 37:17.774
An uneasy feeling settled over
me as soon as Driscoll disappeared.

37:17.844 --> 37:20.472
I was angry at myself
for losing him.

37:20.547 --> 37:24.813
But there was something else,
something I didn't want to look at.

37:32.225 --> 37:34.659
I'd gone looking for Driscoll
with a vengeance,

37:34.727 --> 37:37.992
telling myself I was doing it
for Theo's five-year-old son,

37:38.464 --> 37:42.992
but I wasn't sure anymore whether I
was doing it for the boy, or for me,

37:43.536 --> 37:45.970
for revenge, plain and simple.

37:52.645 --> 37:53.907
It's me.

37:54.681 --> 37:56.080
Come on in.

38:04.924 --> 38:08.087
Chicken soup from Wong Fat's.
Here's your change.

38:10.496 --> 38:11.986
Chinese chicken soup?

38:13.533 --> 38:15.899
Well, his real name's
Wong Fat Schwartz.

38:19.872 --> 38:23.308
Why are you doing this?
And why were you following me?

38:24.744 --> 38:27.804
Some people take care of other people,
that's their job.

38:29.449 --> 38:31.280
Who takes care of you?

38:32.518 --> 38:33.883
You're bleeding.

38:36.489 --> 38:37.717
I'll be okay.

38:38.258 --> 38:39.247
Here, let me
take a look at it.

38:39.325 --> 38:40.815
I'll be okay.

38:48.801 --> 38:50.166
What's your name?

38:50.837 --> 38:51.895
Don't have one.

38:51.971 --> 38:55.065
Oh, come on.
Well, everybody's gotta have a name.

38:55.375 --> 38:56.433
Not me.

38:57.677 --> 38:59.235
Well, what did they call you
in high school?

38:59.312 --> 39:00.336
I never went.

39:00.413 --> 39:01.880
What'd your mom call you?

39:02.282 --> 39:04.011
You gotta be kidding me.

39:06.686 --> 39:10.349
Well, I mean, you can't go
through life not having a name.

39:11.224 --> 39:15.354
I mean, somebody's gotta have something
to call you when they get to know you.

39:15.428 --> 39:17.521
I guess it just never
got to that.

39:17.964 --> 39:19.363
Well, it just did.

39:28.541 --> 39:32.136
What name... What name
would you like to have?

39:33.680 --> 39:34.772
Cappie.

39:35.114 --> 39:37.378
Well, I'm afraid
that one's already taken

39:37.450 --> 39:39.441
by a certain
missing desk clerk.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.517
No, I was just thinking,

39:43.156 --> 39:46.557
why'd Cappie disappear all of a sudden,
the same time as that guy?

39:48.061 --> 39:49.119
Driscoll.

39:49.195 --> 39:50.662
Yeah.

39:51.497 --> 39:56.400
Maybe he figured Driscoll was back,
and Driscoll knew somebody had to finger him,

39:56.469 --> 40:00.064
and that same somebody
could turn him in again.

40:04.977 --> 40:08.606
If he saw Driscoll,
he probably knows where he's hiding out.

40:09.282 --> 40:10.806
I gotta find him.

40:12.185 --> 40:14.119
Who's gonna tell you anything?

40:14.954 --> 40:17.752
Look, we'd have a better
chance if I asked around.

40:20.960 --> 40:21.949
Okay.

40:23.730 --> 40:27.097
And don't get too close.
I don't want you scaring anybody off.

40:29.836 --> 40:31.201
Whatever you say.

40:32.905 --> 40:34.202
Mary Elizabeth.

40:38.878 --> 40:42.974
I never liked my real name, but I've
always sort of liked Mary Elizabeth.

40:43.716 --> 40:45.741
Whatever you say,
Mary Elizabeth.

40:56.996 --> 40:58.224
Thanks a lot.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.462
Frankie saw...

41:03.336 --> 41:06.362
Frankie saw Cappie this morning,
when he was taking his papers,

41:06.439 --> 41:08.373
and he went into
the Randolph building.

41:08.441 --> 41:10.204
He noticed him
and thought it was funny,

41:10.276 --> 41:13.734
because the Randolph building's
been deserted for years.

41:14.046 --> 41:16.981
We'd better pick up
a flashlight. Let's go.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.262
Wait a minute.

41:46.279 --> 41:47.507
Cappie?

41:51.617 --> 41:53.312
I don't think he's here.

42:00.827 --> 42:02.021
Cappie!

42:08.768 --> 42:10.395
Somebody's here.

42:32.458 --> 42:34.858
Cappie? It's me.

42:49.008 --> 42:50.839
Maybe it was just some rats.

42:55.715 --> 42:57.876
Why don't we
get out of here, you know,

42:58.217 --> 43:00.208
come back tomorrow
or something?

43:03.055 --> 43:04.989
See, there's nobody
down here.

43:11.230 --> 43:13.323
Why don't we just turn around?
I think they were wrong.

43:13.399 --> 43:15.299
I don't think
anybody's here.

43:19.772 --> 43:22.070
I don't like it
down here at all.

43:23.509 --> 43:25.409
I can't even breathe anymore.

43:26.679 --> 43:28.044
It's spooky.

43:36.122 --> 43:37.111
Cappie!

43:38.190 --> 43:39.179
Wait!

43:40.326 --> 43:41.850
Mary Elizabeth!

43:53.105 --> 43:54.265
No!

44:13.626 --> 44:15.116
Let her go!

44:15.194 --> 44:16.183
Go to hell, Magnum.

45:16.656 --> 45:20.422
After the feelings of
revenge left, came the healing.

45:20.493 --> 45:22.791
That's what
had always happened before.

45:22.995 --> 45:26.021
But this time
something was different.

45:26.699 --> 45:28.792
And although
I didn't want to admit it,

45:28.868 --> 45:30.335
I knew what it was.

45:30.536 --> 45:33.903
I'd said I was going after
Driscoll for justice,

45:34.774 --> 45:39.609
but when I pulled that trigger, I wasn't
sure if it was for justice, or for me.

45:39.779 --> 45:41.007
Magnum?

45:42.048 --> 45:45.347
No more tea, Higgins.
I'm mending as fast as I can.

45:45.418 --> 45:47.409
I wasn't going
to offer you any.

45:48.154 --> 45:50.145
There's someone here
to see you.

46:10.776 --> 46:14.542
I wanna thank you for finding
the man who killed my husband.

46:31.731 --> 46:34.461
I understand you had a
young girl who helped you.

46:38.337 --> 46:40.828
I wish you'd give her
something for me.

46:43.342 --> 46:47.972
I don't know what a young girl living on the
streets would do with something like this,

46:49.682 --> 46:53.482
but it was the most precious gift
my husband ever gave our son,

46:54.754 --> 46:56.585
and I'd like her to have it.

47:04.096 --> 47:06.121
Tell her, I said, "Thank you,"

47:06.832 --> 47:09.130
and to come
and see me any time.

47:12.772 --> 47:14.569
Her name is Mary Elizabeth.

47:18.711 --> 47:20.235
Mary Elizabeth.

47:21.547 --> 47:23.071
I'll remember.
