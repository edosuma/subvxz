WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:02.795
Previously on 90210:

00:02.836 --> 00:03.629
You're the only one

00:03.671 --> 00:05.840
who really understands
the loss I feel.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.090
Jim took my place that night.

00:07.132 --> 00:09.551
Your husband is dead
because of me.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.553
What am I going to do?
I'm 20 years old,

00:11.595 --> 00:13.347
and the baby's father is dead.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.556
I don't know how we're
going to live together

00:14.598 --> 00:15.641
or raise a baby,

00:15.683 --> 00:16.934
but I want to give it a try.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.560
They paid us to
hang out with them?

00:18.602 --> 00:19.728
We're escorts.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.272
It's totally legal.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.566
You're running a car theft ring
on my stage?
No.

00:24.608 --> 00:27.402
We're running a car theft
ring out of your stage.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.822
I'm gonna have to pull
a all-nighter, and I'm
already losing energy.

00:29.864 --> 00:32.867
AUSTIN:
I got my ADHD medication
in here somewhere.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.827
I gave his stage space
to someone else

00:34.869 --> 00:36.370
last minute,
an-and Juice got pissed.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.621
Do you know how much
I've worked for this?

00:37.663 --> 00:39.206
Your test results came in.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.500
You are not pregnant.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.377
Oh, I can still go to MIT;
you can go to CU.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.796
We could go on with our
lives like we planned.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.923
I know she doesn't want

00:47.965 --> 00:49.341
to know what's Max
was thinking right now,

00:49.383 --> 00:51.134
but someday she will.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.093
HOLLY:
It's a love letter

00:52.135 --> 00:55.055
from Naomi's ex-boyfriend
breaking her heart.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.391
This'll come in handy when
I'm bringing that bitch down.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.852
I'm going to go drop
out of Kappa.
No, you can't.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.021
If I'm going to destroy her,
I need someone on the inside.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.358
♪ ♪

01:07.943 --> 01:09.695
(Naomi gasps)

01:11.989 --> 01:15.868
Oh, I just almost got mauled
by a rabid pack of joggers,

01:15.910 --> 01:17.369
and not one of them
stopped to check me out.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.329
I need a latte, stat.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.372
(sighs)

01:21.623 --> 01:23.375
Ew! What is this, sugar-free?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.002
That's all they serve.

01:25.044 --> 01:27.379
Holly passed a motion last year
to skinnify the coffee bar.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.006
How is that up to her?

01:29.048 --> 01:31.675
Control the Greek Council,
control the campus.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.343
Which brings me
to why I called this meeting.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.933
Ladies, I do not do
second fiddle.

01:38.974 --> 01:41.936
I need to replace Holly
as head of the Greek Council

01:41.977 --> 01:44.688
by beating the Kappas
at the Greek Games.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.481
Uh, Naomi, it's not that easy.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.402
More sweaty joggers.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.780
NAOMI: What in God's name
are they doing?
MARGENE: Running.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.531
(scoffs)
From the fashion police?

01:54.573 --> 01:57.910
Pink velour is so '06!

01:57.952 --> 01:59.536
ALANA: They're training
for the Greek Games.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.663
The whole campus is.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.582
The Kappas paired up
with Tau Pai Nu,

02:03.624 --> 02:05.375
the football
team frat.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.502
They can't lose.

02:07.544 --> 02:08.963
Every sorority pairs
with a fraternity.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.464
We're with Psi Phi Upsilon.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.673
The basketball team?

02:11.715 --> 02:13.008
Chess.
I never realized

02:13.050 --> 02:15.469
these games were so un-fun.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.721
Whatever,
I'm not giving up.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.347
My little double agent
Annie has promised

02:19.389 --> 02:20.808
to throw
the volleyball game.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.350
I mean, it's not
like the Kappas

02:22.392 --> 02:24.895
haven't been beaten before,
right?

02:27.397 --> 02:29.108
Right?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.484
Actually,
three years ago,

02:30.525 --> 02:31.568
the stoner frat
and their partner won.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.112
Chi Phi Tau.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.696
Don't you know one of them--
that Austin guy?

02:35.906 --> 02:37.074
Maybe he could give us
some tips.

02:37.116 --> 02:38.659
The last time I asked
that guy for tips,

02:38.700 --> 02:40.911
I ended up wrestling a pig.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.370
We understand.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.790
Taking Holly down
is a herculean task.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.916
Anyone would be intimidated.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.334
(sighs)
HOLLY:
Watch out, girls,

02:47.375 --> 02:49.294
don't step in any cow pies.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.545
Intimidated?

02:50.587 --> 02:52.923
If you think a bunch
of tanorexics

02:52.965 --> 02:56.301
in mortifying jogging suits
are gonna scare me off,

02:56.343 --> 02:57.845
you clearly don't know me
very well.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.888
(chuckles)

03:03.600 --> 03:05.894
That really is disgusting.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.938
No carbs, Clare.

03:07.980 --> 03:12.026
Okay, all, refuel, regroup
at the lap pool in 20.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.569
Geez, is she
always this tough?

03:14.611 --> 03:16.113
Oh, this is nothing.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.323
Last year she made us sleep
in ankle weights.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.783
(gasps)

03:19.825 --> 03:20.784
Thanks.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.161
Thank you.

03:22.201 --> 03:24.788
You know what? Actually,
I'm fine with just water.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.205
I got it.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.206
Are you sure?

03:27.248 --> 03:28.667
Yes.
I'll pay you back.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.837
I just got my textbooks
and so I'm short on cash.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.964
Look, Annie, if you need
a way to make money quickly,

03:34.006 --> 03:35.966
you know
how to do it.

03:36.008 --> 03:39.511
Yes, well, being a paid
escort isn't the first thing

03:39.553 --> 03:41.388
that comes to mind when
I think after-school job.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.597
Whatever.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.264
After-school job?

03:43.306 --> 03:46.810
Annie, folding sweaters
is so not Kappa.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.229
If you need money, there's
always the Kappa scholarship.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.397
I mean,
it's very competitive,

03:50.438 --> 03:51.648
but with my recommendation,

03:51.690 --> 03:53.150
I'm sure
you'd have a shot.

03:53.192 --> 03:54.943
Wow, that
sounds amazing.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.904
The only thing is, the
application is due this Friday,

03:56.945 --> 03:58.572
so you'd have
to work on the essay

03:58.613 --> 04:00.323
and turn in the application
this week,

04:00.365 --> 04:01.324
so it wouldn't really
give you much time

04:01.366 --> 04:03.035
to train for the Games.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.662
Oh, but what
about volleyball?

04:05.704 --> 04:06.830
Yeah, it's a shame,
but I'm sure

04:06.872 --> 04:09.917
the rest of the girls
would understand.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.630
Sure hope so.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.886
Navid.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.930
For you.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.141
What's this?

04:26.183 --> 04:27.142
(whistles)

04:27.184 --> 04:28.936
Your cut.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.688
Of what,
your stolen car money?

04:31.730 --> 04:34.524
Navid, we are partners now.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.984
I may be
in a dishonorable business,

04:36.026 --> 04:38.946
but I am
an honorable businessman.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.781
That's your half
of the profits.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.700
Cash in a shopping bag?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.619
Oh, I-I've seen
this movie before,

04:45.660 --> 04:47.871
and this never ends well for
the guy with the shopping bag.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.415
I'm not taking
your dirty money.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.417
It's already yours.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.253
Go buy yourself a new car

04:54.294 --> 04:56.088
or do something nice
for one of your friends.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.839
I don't care,

04:57.881 --> 04:59.591
it's out of my hands.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.467
(clicks tongue)

05:06.389 --> 05:08.934
My stuff from home
finally got here.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.686
Right.
(chuckles)

05:14.564 --> 05:16.108
Oh.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.402
Whoa.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.862
(laughs)

05:20.904 --> 05:23.282
This is going on the board.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.450
My mom cut my hair
until I was 16,

05:25.492 --> 05:26.910
okay?

05:29.621 --> 05:31.372
What?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.416
These are the pictures
from that day at the lake.

05:33.458 --> 05:37.004
Jim was so sunburned,
remember?

05:42.383 --> 05:44.343
Apartment rentals?

05:44.385 --> 05:47.639
Yeah, we need
a new place to live.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.516
You're not raising a baby
in a bar.

05:49.557 --> 05:53.478
Wow, are those prices
in dollars?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.772
Yeah, it's expensive
living near the beach.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.524
We could commute.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.820
From Encino.
(laughs)

06:03.071 --> 06:05.364
Maybe we won't have to.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.826
This is from
Jim's life insurance company.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.247
I need to fly back
to Alaska

06:12.289 --> 06:14.415
to file a death certificate.

06:14.457 --> 06:18.545
I couldn't deal with doing it
before, but it's time.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.547
We need the money.

06:20.588 --> 06:24.051
No, no, I am not taking
Jim's life insurance money.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.552
I've been mooching off you
since I got here,

06:25.593 --> 06:26.761
and you're trying
to get the bar off the ground.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.721
Let me help.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.848
Not in that way.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.516
The bar will start
to bring in cash eventually.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.767
We'll be fine.

06:32.809 --> 06:33.935
But we need money now.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.979
(sighs)

06:41.735 --> 06:43.862
(laughs)

06:43.904 --> 06:46.447
Oh, dude, when you said
you had a surprise for me,

06:46.489 --> 06:48.075
I thought it was
free burritos or something.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.743
This has to be expensive.

06:49.784 --> 06:50.160
Studio time?

06:50.202 --> 06:51.328
Ah, don't worry
about what it costs.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.330
It's yours
next five days.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.413
Well, I got a
little extra

06:54.455 --> 06:57.334
because of Bieber,
and, uh, I feel bad

06:57.376 --> 07:00.254
'cause I messed things up
for you with that producer.

07:00.295 --> 07:00.795
Let me make
it up to you.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.549
(laughing):
I... I can't accept this.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.467
It's out of my hands.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.428
Oh, uh, better than burritos?

07:09.470 --> 07:11.014
I'm going to kiss you
on the mouth.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.599
Come here.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, easy now.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.522
Oh, my God,

07:19.564 --> 07:21.024
you're here.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.026
I'm so embarrassed.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.569
Yeah, you, you look
real embarrassed.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.322
Yeah, I was just driving
down from Malibu,

07:27.364 --> 07:28.740
and I spilled an
entire iced coffee

07:28.782 --> 07:31.534
on the front of
my couture dress.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.578
That would be
a $900 dress.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.205
I had to soak it before
the stain set in.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.082
How'd you get in here?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.792
You boys really
should lock up.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.295
I mean, crazies could just
wander in off the street.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.337
(laughs)

07:43.380 --> 07:45.465
Crazies in sexy underwear?

07:45.506 --> 07:47.259
(laughs)
I'm half-naked here;

07:47.301 --> 07:49.052
don't mock me.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.554
The way you're mocking me?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.556
(moans)

07:53.598 --> 07:55.600
What are you
talking about?

07:55.642 --> 07:58.019
Stop wasting my time,
tell me what you want.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.231
Fine. I want your help
with the Greek Games.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.317
I happen to know that you were
with the winning frat

08:03.358 --> 08:06.153
a couple years ago
and I'm gonna need some tips

08:06.194 --> 08:08.655
if I'm going to take down
Holly and her stupid Kappas.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.158
Holly Strickler?

08:11.199 --> 08:12.909
Yes.
And you thought

08:12.951 --> 08:14.869
the way to get my help
was to try and seduce me?

08:14.911 --> 08:16.871
Trust me, this hurts me
more than it hurts you.

08:16.913 --> 08:17.998
I find you repulsive.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.374
And I find you
a pain in the ass.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.375
You know what?
(chuckles)

08:20.417 --> 08:21.668
I don't need your help

08:21.709 --> 08:26.381
because you are
the single most annoying man

08:26.423 --> 08:28.091
on the entire planet.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.051
Well, you're no peach
yourself there, sweetheart.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.139
(low grunt)

08:34.181 --> 08:35.722
(both moaning)

08:38.643 --> 08:40.395
What do you taste like?
What is that-- hay?

08:40.437 --> 08:41.895
(laughs)

08:41.938 --> 08:42.897
(grunts)

08:42.938 --> 08:43.982
(screams)

08:44.024 --> 08:45.775
(both moaning)

08:47.568 --> 08:49.529
Well, now
it's a nine dollar dress.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.530
(both moaning)

09:08.589 --> 09:09.924
I have Devon slated

09:09.966 --> 09:12.010
for the pie-eating contest.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.220
Sheldon,

09:13.261 --> 09:14.346
you look
double-jointed.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.139
You can do
the limbo.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.226
And surfing competition, we
have a ringer-- Ivy Sullivan,

09:19.267 --> 09:20.227
new Pi member.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.436
Say what?

09:21.478 --> 09:23.646
Oh, uh-uh,
n-n-n-no,

09:23.688 --> 09:24.939
I am not joining
your sorority, okay?

09:24.981 --> 09:26.107
Plus, I can't--
I don't even go to CU.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.526
Yes, you do.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.777
I signed you up for ceramics
and paid Alexis

09:29.819 --> 09:31.363
to go to class
for you every week.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.947
You're welcome.
Wait,

09:32.989 --> 09:34.782
so what about that Austin guy?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.076
He wouldn't do anything
for you?

09:36.117 --> 09:37.160
(chuckles)

09:37.202 --> 09:39.079
Nothing pertinent to the Games.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.621
New plan--

09:40.663 --> 09:44.334
it's just us,
but we do have Annie.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.836
Actually, uh, no, you don't.

09:46.878 --> 09:47.962
I had to drop out of the Games.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.381
No, no,

09:49.423 --> 09:50.549
you're... you're
our secret weapon.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.925
How are we supposed
to win without you?

09:51.966 --> 09:53.676
I'm sorry.
(overlapping chatter)

09:55.136 --> 09:57.805
AUSTIN: There's one way
to beat the Kappas.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.475
Me.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.352
The key, ladies,
to defeating the enemy

10:02.394 --> 10:04.229
is finding their Achilles heel.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.980
Every team has one;
I'll find theirs.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.774
That's my end
of the bargain.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.984
Yours is,
you got to be ready to strike.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.570
The year my frat

10:11.611 --> 10:13.154
won the Games, we all stopped
smoking weed for an entire week.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.948
You want to win?

10:14.989 --> 10:16.533
You need that level
of commitment, ladies.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.034
You want a
secret weapon?

10:18.076 --> 10:20.078
You got one.

10:21.662 --> 10:22.997
Now, who's in?

10:24.749 --> 10:25.959
(whistles)

10:26.000 --> 10:27.961
All right, last one
to the practice field

10:28.002 --> 10:29.588
does suicide sprints, let's go.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.214
That's right,
let's go, let's go.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.715
Whoo!
Whoo!

10:32.757 --> 10:34.968
Look at all the dudes,
all right.

10:35.009 --> 10:35.969
That means you, too,

10:36.010 --> 10:36.970
bird legs.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.179
What?
Come on.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.598
Ow!
Come on, let's go, go, let's go!

10:43.268 --> 10:44.685
Morning, beautiful.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.729
(both laugh)

10:46.771 --> 10:47.772
Thanks.

10:47.814 --> 10:48.982
Yeah.

10:49.023 --> 10:49.983
You're in a
good mood.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.526
Yeah, I like knowing
Dixon is heading

10:51.568 --> 10:54.321
to his first day
in the studio right now.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.405
You should have seen
his face.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.616
It was classic.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.242
Can you really
afford this?

10:59.284 --> 11:01.411
Yeah. Just got it covered.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.291
Navid, talk to me.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.627
Tell me what's going on.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.170
Did you have to bump
Juice for Bieber

11:10.211 --> 11:11.921
because your family needs money?

11:11.963 --> 11:15.467
It was... it was
definitely for my family.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.012
Look, it's done, okay?

11:19.053 --> 11:21.431
I got some extra money, and I'm
making things right with Dixon.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.142
It feels good.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.811
In fact, why don't I fund
a little project for you?

11:26.853 --> 11:28.480
I mean, you need
something on your reel

11:28.522 --> 11:30.689
other than documentaries.
Navid, you don't
have to do that.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.484
I know I don't have to do it.
I want to.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.735
We'll just call me
your Sugar Daddy.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.196
No, I will not.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.323
Please? Just once.
Okay.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.325
No.
(laughs)

11:40.367 --> 11:42.701
No, quit it.
I'm not asking for much.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.703
(laughing)

11:44.745 --> 11:46.747
There's nowhere
to put all of this.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.333
The walk-in is completely full.

11:48.375 --> 11:52.587
Man. We moved twice this amount
at the opening.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.712
I based the order on that.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.300
Maybe we store it
in your bedroom, or something?

11:57.342 --> 11:58.801
Is Jane sleeping?

11:58.843 --> 12:00.637
She went to Alaska
for a few days.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.015
Is everything okay?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.850
If by okay you mean

12:05.892 --> 12:07.852
we're going to be living on her
dead husband's insurance money

12:07.894 --> 12:09.187
because the bar's
not turning a profit,

12:09.229 --> 12:10.813
then yeah, things are great.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.358
These things take time.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.984
I don't have time.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.362
I gotta make this
thing work now.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.446
It's not just Jane, you know,

12:18.488 --> 12:19.864
it's my life.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.077
Sorry, I thought you were open.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.953
We are.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.957
You know what?
I need some air.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.792
Do you think I could take
my break right now?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.628
Hmm.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.796
Yeah, I think I
could spare you.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.090
ADRIANNA:
Thank you.

12:43.513 --> 12:44.972
Sorry about that.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.807
I just cannot do
the casual thing with Ade.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.643
I don't know
if I'll ever be able to.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.395
Not getting in
the middle of it.
(sighs)

12:50.437 --> 12:52.230
Fair enough. Okay.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.732
Happier topic.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.442
So Navid is funding
a project for me.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.652
I know a lot of directors
get started in commercials,

12:57.694 --> 13:00.363
so I was thinking:
you need to advertise, right?

13:00.405 --> 13:01.740
I need experience.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.575
Now, before you say no...
I'll do it.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.578
You realize I want you to
be in the commercial, right?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.705
If it will help
the bar take off,

13:08.747 --> 13:10.873
I will... tap dance
in a chicken suit.
Okay.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.833
Well, I was thinking more
jazz hands in a gorilla suit,

13:12.875 --> 13:14.210
but I will consider
a chicken suit.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.336
All right.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.009
Hey, wait a minute.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.303
Do I know you?

13:23.344 --> 13:25.472
Yeah, I do.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.014
You work at that
bar on Main.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.015
Offshore, yeah.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.770
That's gotta be hard work,

13:31.810 --> 13:34.897
slinging cocktails for
sunburnt tourists. Right?

13:34.939 --> 13:36.566
You on your break?

13:36.608 --> 13:40.487
Um... actually,
it's more like a mental break.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.946
There was an uncomfortable
situation that

13:41.988 --> 13:43.239
I needed to get away from.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.366
So...
What is it, your boss?

13:45.408 --> 13:46.701
Mmm.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.453
No, he's actually my friend.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.121
But he wants to be more?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.456
It's typical.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.957
No, it's not like that.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.501
That's probably why
he's running a bar

13:54.542 --> 13:56.711
in the first place, is to
pick up pretty girls like you.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.798
He's more like my brother.
My really protective brother.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.882
I don't... I don't mean
anything by it.

14:01.924 --> 14:05.303
And it's, it's good that
he doesn't hit on you.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.806
So does he have a
girlfriend or something?

14:10.433 --> 14:11.726
You know what?
It's getting late.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.311
I really should
be heading back.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.062
Uh, but it was
nice meeting you.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.897
Bye.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.862
♪ Two girls... uh...
two more... ♪

14:26.366 --> 14:29.494
♪ Mm, they... uh, uh... ♪

14:29.536 --> 14:30.704
(music and beats cut off)

14:34.374 --> 14:36.751
Look, I-I-I can't,
I can't think of nothing, man.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.086
Um... what do you think?

14:40.797 --> 14:43.132
Well, I don't think you're
going to be cutting an EP

14:43.174 --> 14:44.551
in five days at this pace.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.345
But... don't feel bad, kid.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.848
The artists who are
blowing up at your age,

14:49.889 --> 14:51.766
they're of a certain breed.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.644
They eat, sleep
and breathe music 24-7.

14:54.686 --> 14:58.565
Believe me, not everybody
has that kind of focus.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.902
Let's, uh, switch up
line 23, 24...

15:02.943 --> 15:06.656
Um, yo, uh...
can I get a minute?

15:23.548 --> 15:25.966
Hi. Can I help you?

15:26.008 --> 15:27.968
Got anything to
quench my thirst?

15:32.139 --> 15:35.769
Here at Offshore,
the beer is cold...

15:35.810 --> 15:37.353
the view is hot...

15:37.395 --> 15:38.521
and the surf is up.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.106
So come on down.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.066
(giggles)

15:43.777 --> 15:44.903
Cut!

15:44.944 --> 15:45.904
What?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.113
Liam, what are you doing?

15:47.154 --> 15:48.656
I'm... I'm acting.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.032
Well, don't.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.118
Yeah, maybe don't. Ever.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.870
And you, I really need
you to hit your mark.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.288
Are you seeing the tape
on the ground?

15:55.329 --> 15:56.956
I'm kind of seeing two.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.376
Is this real beer?!

16:00.418 --> 16:02.253
Props!

16:02.295 --> 16:03.129
Great. Uh, all right.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.672
Can someone make
a coffee run for her?

16:04.714 --> 16:06.132
Please? Really fast?

16:06.173 --> 16:08.509
And get an iced tea for Coco!
She's thirsty.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.928
Is it hot in here?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.304
Yeah, the AC's busted.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.932
I think we blew out a fuse
because of all these lights.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.433
Everybody hang in there, okay?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.393
If we can stay on track for one
more hour, we can make our day.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.395
Wardrobe!

16:19.437 --> 16:20.897
What now?

16:20.939 --> 16:22.649
I think Coco
just puffed.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.820
Okay, everybody.
Take five.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.696
Okay? Take five.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.958
AUSTIN:
Last one. Last one,
Clark, let's go.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.292
That's what you said last time.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.669
Yeah, I lied.
Nice work.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.128
You're the devil.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.172
And you made a deal with me.
Yes, I did.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.715
And we are running
ourselves ragged here.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.884
When are you going to live up
to your half of the bargain?

16:49.926 --> 16:51.302
Tonight. I know
Holly's weakness.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.554
Right. What is it already?

16:53.596 --> 16:55.890
You'll see. Just meet me at
the track here tonight, 9:00.

She runs in the dark so
nobody sees her sweat.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.518

Nice work, ladies.

Oh, my gosh.
I am so sorry.

LIAM:
What are you doing there?

17:26.212 --> 17:27.881

17:28.798 --> 17:30.550
And that's a wrap!

17:30.591 --> 17:32.510
(bell rings)

17:32.552 --> 17:34.220
Sorry. I know that wasn't
supposed to be funny,

17:34.261 --> 17:35.972
but that really was.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.059
Are you sure you got it?

17:40.100 --> 17:42.311
Because I really want
to give it my all, you know?

17:42.353 --> 17:45.606
Liam, you've given me
all you can give me.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.567
That, I am sure of.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.821
That was brilliant.
Shut up, man.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.866
So how'd it go?

17:54.908 --> 17:57.827
Let's just say
Robert De Niro I am not.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.537
You know what?
You've had a long day.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.205
I'll clean it up.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.207
Really?

18:03.249 --> 18:04.208
Are you sure?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.209
I'm sure.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.753
Good night, Mr. De Niro.

18:22.685 --> 18:23.895
Hey. I've been out
on the deck.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.229
You're home!
What are you doing?

18:25.271 --> 18:26.522
I thought this was
Austin's room.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.608
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.568
He's just... always
stealing my socks.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.862
Um, what are you doing here?

18:32.904 --> 18:34.655
Oh, Austin let me in
before he left.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.033
I cannot get any work done
at the sorority.

18:37.075 --> 18:40.453
Someone is always

Nothing.
They were doing nothing.

Like me.

Liam, what's going on?

Why are you so mad?

I can't provide for you, I can't
help the people I care about,

30:30.621 --> 30:32.539
I can't get this stupid place
off the ground.

30:32.581 --> 30:35.334
I hate that you had
to go back to Alaska

30:35.375 --> 30:37.628
to get Jim's life
insurance money.

30:37.670 --> 30:40.339
You didn't want to face
it, but you had to,

30:40.380 --> 30:42.341
because of me.

30:43.883 --> 30:45.594
(sighs)

30:45.636 --> 30:50.474
Liam, I had to face it
because it's reality.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.893
I just want to protect you,
and I feel like I'm failing.

30:57.523 --> 31:02.444

It was nice of you.

Look, I'm sorry I startled you.

31:30.639 --> 31:33.266
Your friend called and said
you were ready to talk, so...

31:33.308 --> 31:35.101
That girl's not my friend.

31:35.143 --> 31:37.396
She's this sorority chick
that I've been sparring with.

31:37.437 --> 31:40.106
I didn't tell her to call you,
and, you know, I'm really sorry

31:40.148 --> 31:43.402
that you came all this way
under false pretenses.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.862
No, I...

all your numbers.

wrote that letter.
Max...

vulnerable with you.

I don't do it ever!

32:18.687 --> 32:22.691
I was an idiot, but...

32:22.733 --> 32:24.192
