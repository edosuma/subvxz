<i>I-- I don't understand.</i>

<i>Eternal damnation? Infinite suffering?</i>
<i>It's a pretty straightforward concept.</i>

<i>But why am I here?</i>

<i>Well, that's between you</i>

07:27.697 --> 07:29.323
<i>It's what brought you here,</i>

<i>okay?</i>

<i>But I had everything.</i>

08:11.657 --> 08:13.034
<i>women, money...</i>

08:13.534 --> 08:14.785
<i>I had it all.</i>

<i>Marina del Rey?</i>

<i>Los Angeles.</i>

<i>[sighs]</i>

<i>You know...</i>

<i>there's a good chance</i>
<i>I know who's on your case.</i>

08:37.225 --> 08:39.393
<i>We were quite a team, once upon a time.</i>

08:41.187 --> 08:42.021
<i>I mean...</i>

08:42.730 --> 08:44.982
<i>to them, it's only been a few months,</i>
<i>a blink of an eye,</i>

08:45.066 --> 08:46.692
<i>but down here, it's been...</i>

08:47.527 --> 08:49.570
<i>much, much longer.</i>

08:52.406 --> 08:54.116
<i>This is your lucky day.</i>

08:54.200 --> 08:55.701
<i>It doesn't really seem like it.</i>

08:55.785 --> 08:58.871
<i>I'm gonna do something</i>
<i>I haven't done in ages,</i>

08:59.330 --> 09:00.623
<i>for old times' sake.</i>

09:01.040 --> 09:03.292
<i>I am going to solve your murder.</i>

09:16.722 --> 09:18.099
<i>So how is this gonna work?</i>

09:18.182 --> 09:21.269
<i>Is the killer gonna come through that door</i>
<i>and shoot me again? 'Cause that hurt.</i>

09:21.352 --> 09:25.064
<i>Usually, yes, but me being</i>
<i>the Lord of Hell does have its perks.</i>

09:26.566 --> 09:27.400
<i>Oh, sh--</i>

09:40.121 --> 09:43.165
<i>You see, everyone in your Hell loop</i>
<i>is played by a demon.</i>

09:43.374 --> 09:44.792
<i>I have control over them.</i>

09:46.544 --> 09:47.712
<i>Give us a wave, Belios.</i>

09:49.171 --> 09:50.089
<i>What's up?</i>

09:50.506 --> 09:51.340
<i>So,</i>

09:52.049 --> 09:53.342
<i>if you can freeze them,</i>

09:53.426 --> 09:56.679
<i>then it should be easy to figure out</i>
<i>who the killer is, right?</i>

09:56.762 --> 09:58.681
<i>I mean, I can just lift this up and--</i>

09:58.764 --> 09:59.807
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

10:00.349 --> 10:02.643
<i>Again, not that simple.</i>

10:04.562 --> 10:07.648
<i>See, your Hell loop is made up</i>
<i>entirely of your own memories.</i>

10:07.732 --> 10:11.110
<i>You never saw your killer's face,</i>
<i>hence a big nothing.</i>

10:12.069 --> 10:13.237
<i>No offense, Belios.</i>

10:13.321 --> 10:16.115
<i>And take the rest of the day off.</i>
<i>You've certainly earned it.</i>

10:17.742 --> 10:20.202
<i>So, how are we gonna find my killer, then?</i>

10:20.953 --> 10:24.081
<i>With good old-fashioned detective work,</i>
mon frère.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.542
<i>And lucky for you,</i>
<i>I learned from the best.</i>

10:26.792 --> 10:28.377
<i>So, step one.</i>

10:29.337 --> 10:31.380
<i>Who wanted you dead? [chuckles]</i>

<i>My brother always ran</i>

<i>[Chloe] Mm.</i>

10:44.977 --> 10:47.104
<i>Is it too bright in here for you,</i>
<i>Detective?</i>

10:47.396 --> 10:48.314
<i>Oh. No.</i>

10:48.397 --> 10:52.693
<i>No, I just have, like,</i>
<i>a light, um, sensitivity thing.</i>

10:53.319 --> 10:55.488
<i>Um, so... </i>
<i>Uh, when they found your brother,</i>

10:55.571 --> 10:59.075
<i>he was on a very expensive yacht</i>
<i>that he owned.</i>

10:59.158 --> 11:00.910
<i>Maybe he turned his life around.</i>

11:01.452 --> 11:02.286
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:02.995 --> 11:04.538
<i>That'd be a first.</i>

<i>but hey, message received,</i>

<i>'cause I owe Dirty Doug</i>
<i>a ton of cash that I don't have.</i>

12:41.677 --> 12:46.557

<i>until Angry Bird here ended those plans.</i>

31:49.324 --> 31:52.076
<i>"It's safe where you stored it."</i>

31:52.160 --> 31:53.161
<i>Where I stored what?</i>

31:53.244 --> 31:55.246
<i>Wait, did you store it</i>
<i>or did she store it?</i>

31:55.330 --> 31:56.623
<i>"You stored it, and it's safe."</i>

31:56.706 --> 31:58.666
<i>-What did I store, though?</i>
<i>-No, not you.</i>

31:58.750 --> 32:00.919
<i>Who stored what? I'm so confused.</i>

32:01.002 --> 32:02.128
<i>I'm confused, too.</i>

32:02.211 --> 32:03.379
<i>That's why I'm sharing this.</i>

32:03.713 --> 32:06.799
<i>"You stored it." </i>
<i>"You stored it," "You stored it..."</i>

32:06.883 --> 32:08.801
<i>Yes! I knew that sounded familiar.</i>

32:08.885 --> 32:09.802
<i>"You stored..."</i>

32:10.094 --> 32:11.387
<i>Lee's credit card statements.</i>

32:11.471 --> 32:14.766
<i>He was making regular payments</i>
<i>to a storage facility in Pacoima called...</i>

32:15.224 --> 32:16.142
<i>You Stored It!</i>

32:16.225 --> 32:18.770
<i>Amazing. Good.</i>
<i>All right, let's go check it out.</i>

32:18.853 --> 32:20.396
<i>So what CI gave you this lead?</i>

32:23.608 --> 32:24.609
<i>[clears throat]</i>

32:25.610 --> 32:29.989
<i>Something very weird happened</i>
<i>with Gill's corpse.</i>

32:41.167 --> 32:42.293
<i>[Lee] Hmm.</i>

32:43.211 --> 32:45.588
<i>I used to have a car just like this.</i>

32:45.672 --> 32:46.506
<i>Ah...</i>

32:48.424 --> 32:49.676
<i>This is my car.</i>

32:51.386 --> 32:52.220
<i>Where are we?</i>

32:52.303 --> 32:54.389
<i>The root of your Hell loop.</i>

32:57.225 --> 32:59.102
<i>Oh, no, not here.</i>

33:00.019 --> 33:02.271
<i>[partygoers laughing]</i>

33:03.231 --> 33:05.274
<i>So why didn't you tell me about the demon?</i>

33:05.817 --> 33:07.902
<i>Maimed bodies, demons from Hell...</i>

33:08.319 --> 33:09.779
<i>It's kind of my jam, Chloe.</i>

33:09.862 --> 33:12.824
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>It just happened really fast,</i>

33:12.907 --> 33:15.910
<i>and it caught me off guard</i>
<i>hearing from Lucifer like that.</i>

33:19.247 --> 33:20.123
<i>It's open.</i>

33:36.931 --> 33:38.057
<i>-[Chloe gasps]</i>
<i>-[Maze grunts]</i>

33:38.141 --> 33:39.100
<i>[Maze yells]</i>

33:39.892 --> 33:41.436
<i>[woman yelps]</i>

33:42.270 --> 33:44.605
<i>-[Chloe] Meg?</i>
<i>-[Meg panting]</i>

33:52.363 --> 33:54.365
<i>[dance music plays]</i>

33:59.120 --> 34:00.455
<i>[Amenadiel] </i>All right, Kyle.

34:00.538 --> 34:02.582
<i>If you're gonna keep selling</i>
<i>in my place, man,</i>

34:02.665 --> 34:04.667
<i>why don't we lay down some ground rules?</i>

34:04.751 --> 34:07.170
<i>I prefer the way</i>
<i>the old management did things.</i>

34:07.253 --> 34:08.296
<i>[Amenadiel] Hm.</i>

34:09.088 --> 34:10.798
<i>It was more of a hands-off policy.</i>

34:10.882 --> 34:12.467
<i>The past is the past, Kyle.</i>

34:12.967 --> 34:14.927
<i>I'm here to talk about the future, bro.</i>

34:15.511 --> 34:17.638
<i>So I suggest you evolve.</i>

34:19.682 --> 34:21.726
<i>So how is this supposed to work, then?</i>

34:21.809 --> 34:25.605
<i>Going forward, I'm gonna take</i>
<i>20% off the top of everything you sell.</i>

34:25.688 --> 34:26.647
<i>That's the deal.</i>

34:27.523 --> 34:28.816
<i>That's the only deal.</i>

34:31.778 --> 34:32.612
<i>Whatever.</i>

34:34.113 --> 34:35.406
<i>This place is bumping so hard,</i>

34:35.865 --> 34:37.283
<i>we're both gonna make a killing.</i>

34:37.867 --> 34:39.410
<i>Not so fast, little man.</i>

34:39.994 --> 34:42.288
<i>If you're going to be selling drugs</i>
<i>in my place,</i>

34:42.371 --> 34:45.833
<i>see, I need to know</i>
<i>that it's top-shelf product,</i> <i>you feel me?</i>

34:46.334 --> 34:47.335
<i>I feel you.</i>

34:47.418 --> 34:48.836
<i>All right, let's see it.</i>

34:58.679 --> 35:00.139
<i>There's more where that came from.</i>

35:00.223 --> 35:02.266
<i>Looks like good drugs.</i>

35:03.059 --> 35:04.852
<i>Police! Show me your hands.</i>

35:04.936 --> 35:05.937
<i>Show me your hands!</i>

35:09.398 --> 35:10.274
<i>Don't move.</i>

35:13.444 --> 35:14.403
<i>What the hell?</i>

35:14.570 --> 35:16.114
<i>Who's your supplier?</i>

35:16.489 --> 35:18.157
<i>Kyle? Tell me!</i>

35:18.491 --> 35:19.325
<i>There...</i>

35:19.408 --> 35:20.535
<i>is none.</i>

35:20.618 --> 35:21.994
<i>Where'd you get the drugs from?</i>

35:23.037 --> 35:23.913
<i>My mom.</i>

35:25.456 --> 35:26.749
<i>She just had back surgery.</i>

35:28.292 --> 35:29.252
<i>There's nothing here.</i>

35:29.836 --> 35:31.170
<i>Just the one baggie.</i>

35:34.006 --> 35:36.384
<i>You just said there was more, so where?</i>

35:36.467 --> 35:38.261
<i>I was maybe gonna hit up my grandpa.</i>

35:38.344 --> 35:39.387
<i>[sighs]</i>

35:40.429 --> 35:42.473
<i>He's getting his gallbladder removed.</i>

35:59.240 --> 36:01.200
<i>Dan, I was just trying</i>
<i>to make the world...</i>

36:02.326 --> 36:03.703
<i>a safer place for--</i>

36:03.786 --> 36:04.620
<i>For Charlie.</i>

36:07.373 --> 36:08.207
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:10.459 --> 36:12.211
<i>It's a crazy thing, being a parent.</i>

36:14.255 --> 36:15.506
<i>When Trixie was born...</i>

36:16.382 --> 36:17.466
<i>I tried to be Supercop...</i>

36:18.467 --> 36:20.219
<i>and round up all the criminals I could.</i>

36:21.888 --> 36:22.889
<i>Then I realized...</i>

36:23.556 --> 36:26.559
<i>removing all the danger in the world</i>
<i>is like trying to bottle up the ocean.</i>

36:30.646 --> 36:32.148
<i>You want to keep Charlie safe?</i>

36:34.025 --> 36:35.484
<i>Just be there for him.</i>

36:37.528 --> 36:38.571
<i>Be a good dad.</i>

36:45.828 --> 36:47.413
<i>How could you bring me here?</i>

36:48.998 --> 36:50.082
<i>So you recognize it?</i>

36:51.876 --> 36:53.419
<i>Of course you do, it's your memories.</i>

36:53.502 --> 36:55.004
<i>This is my parents' house.</i>

36:57.548 --> 36:58.966
<i>The house I grew up in.</i>

37:00.384 --> 37:02.970
<i>I haven't been here in 15 years.</i>

37:03.054 --> 37:04.055
<i>[sighs]</i>

37:04.722 --> 37:05.556
<i>Meg...</i>

37:05.932 --> 37:08.559
<i>She just had a baby, my niece.</i>

37:10.353 --> 37:11.979
<i>This was her baby shower.</i>

37:13.648 --> 37:16.609
<i>I mean, this was the last time</i>
<i>my whole family got together.</i>

37:18.444 --> 37:20.821
<i>My mom, she got sick right after it.</i>

37:22.949 --> 37:23.908
<i>She died.</i>

37:25.743 --> 37:27.620
<i>My dad followed right after.</i>

37:33.292 --> 37:35.169
<i>This was my last chance,</i>

37:35.628 --> 37:37.380
<i>and I didn't go inside.</i>

37:40.216 --> 37:42.969
<i>[Meg] I found this place</i>
<i>and these credit card receipts.</i>

37:43.052 --> 37:45.554
<i>I kept wondering</i>
<i>why they would take his hand.</i>

37:46.097 --> 37:48.266
<i>Then I saw the biometric safe.</i>

37:49.183 --> 37:50.601
<i>They used his hand to open it.</i>

37:50.685 --> 37:52.395
<i>Must have been where he kept</i>
<i>all his money.</i>

37:54.522 --> 37:57.108
<i>[exhales] The safe at You Stored It.</i>

37:57.191 --> 37:59.735
<i>That's what Lucifer was trying to tell me.</i>
<i>It's all about the safe.</i>

38:00.111 --> 38:01.237
<i>Who else knew about it?</i>

38:01.320 --> 38:02.530
<i>I don't know. Um...</i>

38:03.823 --> 38:06.284
<i>His old crew, maybe?</i>
<i>He was pretty tight with them.</i>

38:06.367 --> 38:09.912
<i>Someone must have hired Gill to kill Lee</i>
<i>and use his hand to get the money.</i>

38:11.247 --> 38:12.873
<i>And what were you gonna do with that gun?</i>

38:12.957 --> 38:14.959
<i>I heard you guys coming. I freaked.</i>

38:15.042 --> 38:17.169
<i>I grabbed Lee's gun to defend myself.</i>

38:17.253 --> 38:18.629
<i>I thought it might have been...</i>

38:19.213 --> 38:22.300
<i>[sighs] I don't know, </i>
<i>his killer coming back?</i>

38:24.260 --> 38:27.847
<i>Honestly, I don't know what I would've</i>
<i>done if it had been Lee's killer.</i>

38:28.472 --> 38:29.682
<i>I was just so angry.</i>

38:30.349 --> 38:34.103
<i>It's a lot of legwork to do for a brother</i>
<i>that you've already written off.</i>

38:35.771 --> 38:36.605
<i>[Meg] Yeah.</i>

38:37.189 --> 38:38.858
<i>I kept telling myself it didn't matter,</i>

38:38.941 --> 38:41.402
<i>I didn't care that he was gone, but, uh...</i>

38:42.028 --> 38:44.780
<i>his death's drugged up a lot of emotions.</i>

38:46.240 --> 38:48.242
<i>-The truth is--</i>
<i>-That you still miss him?</i>

38:50.202 --> 38:52.955
<i>I spent every day expecting him</i>
<i>to walk through the door.</i>

38:53.998 --> 38:56.751
<i>Guess now I finally have to accept</i>
<i>he's never coming home.</i>

39:00.171 --> 39:01.839
<i>All right. I'll take you home.</i>

39:05.343 --> 39:07.636
<i>I'd like to grab some of Lee's things,</i>
<i>if that's okay.</i>

39:09.513 --> 39:10.473
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

39:12.933 --> 39:15.561
<i>[Maze] So what's next?</i>
<i>We gonna crack some skulls,</i>

39:15.644 --> 39:16.896
<i>track down Lee's old crew?</i>

39:17.813 --> 39:21.067
<i>Uh, Maze, actually, I think </i>
<i>I want to, um...</i>

39:22.818 --> 39:25.363
<i>just take a beat to process some things.</i>

39:26.072 --> 39:27.198
<i>What's wrong?</i>

39:29.033 --> 39:32.661
<i>Well, I-I think that I've been avoiding</i>
<i>dealing with the fact that</i>

39:33.079 --> 39:34.413
<i>Lucifer isn't coming back.</i>

39:34.997 --> 39:35.873
<i>Or...</i>

39:36.832 --> 39:38.667
<i>you figured out that you don't need him.</i>

39:40.086 --> 39:42.797
<i>We</i> don't need him,

39:43.422 --> 39:44.673
<i>or anyone.</i>

39:45.132 --> 39:46.634
<i>Chloe, you and I...</i>

39:48.135 --> 39:49.053
<i>We're good.</i>

39:50.679 --> 39:51.555
<i>Maze...</i>

39:54.725 --> 39:55.601
<i>[chuckles nervously]</i>

39:57.103 --> 39:59.480
<i>The thing is, I'm... I'm not good.</i>

40:00.231 --> 40:02.066
<i>And I don't think you're good, either.</i>

40:03.317 --> 40:05.903
<i>I-I don't know exactly what happened</i>
<i>with you and Eve--</i>

40:05.986 --> 40:07.071
<i>This isn't about Eve.</i>

40:07.863 --> 40:08.697
<i>But...</i>

40:09.740 --> 40:10.699
<i>Okay, this is...</i>

40:10.991 --> 40:14.161
<i>This isn't about Eve, this is about</i>
<i>what's right in front of us.</i>

40:14.537 --> 40:16.330
<i>Right here, right now, you and me.</i>

40:16.414 --> 40:18.457
<i>Maze, I know what it feels like</i>
<i>to be abandoned.</i>

40:19.333 --> 40:22.169
<i>You know, I mean, I've been</i>
<i>throwing myself into work, and...</i>

40:22.837 --> 40:24.922
<i>going out with you so that...</i>

40:25.923 --> 40:27.591
<i>I don't have to face it and...</i>

40:30.428 --> 40:33.973
<i>I just think maybe you and I are using</i>
<i>this partnership to fill a void</i>

40:34.056 --> 40:35.933
<i>that someone else has left behind.</i>

40:37.852 --> 40:38.727
<i>So...</i>

40:40.521 --> 40:45.025
<i>I-I think that it's best </i>
<i>if we step back...</i>

40:46.527 --> 40:47.570
<i>from working together.</i>

40:51.240 --> 40:52.074
<i>Yeah.</i>

40:53.451 --> 40:54.326
<i>Good idea.</i>

40:58.247 --> 41:00.040
<i>[Lucifer] </i>Ah, the wonders of Hell.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.376
<i>So, your sister's baby shower, huh?</i>

41:02.460 --> 41:06.380
<i>What a joyous occasion,</i>
<i>full of warmth and happiness.</i>

41:06.464 --> 41:07.965
<i>Truly a celebration of life.</i>

41:08.048 --> 41:09.884
<i>So go on, then. Go inside.</i>

41:11.719 --> 41:12.636
<i>I-I can't.</i>

41:12.720 --> 41:15.848
<i>Of course you can. It'd be so simple.</i>
<i>Just open the door and walk in.</i>

41:16.307 --> 41:18.893
<i>-They don't want me in there.</i>
<i>-But they invited you, didn't they?</i>

41:18.976 --> 41:19.977
<i>Well, they didn't mean it.</i>

41:20.060 --> 41:22.271
<i>Oh, come on. Excuses!</i>

41:22.354 --> 41:23.272
<i>They're like arseholes,</i>

41:23.355 --> 41:25.232
<i>everybody's got one,</i>
<i>but nobody wants to hear it.</i>

41:25.316 --> 41:28.235
<i>-I'm not making excuses for anything.</i>
<i>-No?</i>

41:28.319 --> 41:30.988
<i>Well, your whole family is in there,</i>
<i>yet you're here.</i>

41:31.906 --> 41:32.740
<i>Why?</i>

41:34.158 --> 41:35.367
<i>Is it because you're afraid?</i>

41:36.994 --> 41:37.870
<i>Afraid?</i>

41:38.913 --> 41:41.332
<i>Why would I be afraid</i>
<i>to see my own family?</i>

41:41.665 --> 41:43.083
<i>'Cause you know</i>

41:43.167 --> 41:45.794
<i>if you go through that door,</i>
<i>it's only a matter of time</i>

41:45.878 --> 41:48.339
<i>before you screw up again, isn't it?</i>

41:49.173 --> 41:53.844
<i>Might take two days, two months,</i>
<i>two years, but it's gonna happen.</i>

41:54.345 --> 41:57.181
<i>You're gonna rob a bank or steal a car,</i>

41:57.556 --> 41:58.807
<i>pawn a family heirloom.</i>

41:58.891 --> 42:00.434
<i>It is inevitable.</i>

42:00.518 --> 42:04.230
<i>Sooner or later,</i>
<i>you are going to disappoint them</i>

42:04.647 --> 42:06.732
<i>all over again!</i>

42:12.029 --> 42:14.490
<i>And so you'd rather stay away</i>
<i>for all eternity.</i>

42:18.035 --> 42:18.911
<i>You're right.</i>

42:20.955 --> 42:22.623
<i>It's true, all of it.</i>

42:23.958 --> 42:24.875
<i>It is.</i>

42:30.631 --> 42:33.509
<i>Hey, this isn't just about me, is it?</i>

42:35.970 --> 42:37.596
<i>Whose Hell is this anyway?</i>

42:43.185 --> 42:46.063
<i>And then Lee took me to see </i>Saw.

42:46.981 --> 42:48.774
<i>It was our first R-rated movie.</i>

42:49.400 --> 42:50.234
<i>I was...</i>

42:57.283 --> 42:58.117
<i>[shotgun cocks]</i>

42:58.409 --> 43:00.202
<i>You, put your gun on the counter.</i>

43:01.704 --> 43:02.621
<i>[Chloe] All right.</i>

43:04.331 --> 43:05.958
<i>Do it now.</i>

43:06.417 --> 43:07.876
<i>Let's just all stay calm.</i>

43:13.299 --> 43:14.174
<i>You're Rod.</i>

43:15.426 --> 43:16.552
<i>You used to room with Lee.</i>

43:17.636 --> 43:18.762
<i>Did you kill him?</i>

43:18.846 --> 43:20.931
<i>That loser brother of yours</i>
<i>gave us no choice.</i>

43:21.015 --> 43:23.225
<i>He still owes us our cut</i>
<i>from our last job.</i>

43:23.642 --> 43:25.352
<i>Now, where's the money from the safe?</i>

43:25.561 --> 43:26.937
<i>You don't have it?</i>

43:28.063 --> 43:29.857
<i>The safe was empty when we got there.</i>

43:30.482 --> 43:32.276
<i>[laughs]</i>

43:32.359 --> 43:33.527
<i>What the hell's so funny?</i>

43:35.195 --> 43:36.322
<i>I mean, of course it's gone.</i>

<i>You knew my brother.</i>

43:37.740 --> 43:40.200
<i>He probably thought</i>

43:40.576 --> 43:42.828
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>spend it on that stupid boat.</i>

43:44.622 --> 43:46.415
<i>Quit stalling and give us the money.</i>

43:46.498 --> 43:47.499
<i>I've got the money.</i>

43:48.792 --> 43:50.044
<i>It's right here.</i>

43:50.127 --> 43:51.337
<i>It's in the bag.</i>

44:12.066 --> 44:13.984
<i>Are you sure this is my Hell?</i>

44:16.862 --> 44:19.073
<i>-Well, who else's would it be?</i>
<i>-I don't know,</i>

44:19.156 --> 44:21.283
<i>but I'm thinking you're just here</i>
<i>torturing yourself.</i>

44:21.367 --> 44:23.452
<i>[chuckles] Preposterous.</i>

44:23.869 --> 44:27.289
<i>Have you forgotten this is your Hell loop?</i>
<i>How does this have anything to do with me?</i>

44:27.373 --> 44:28.540
<i>I'm just saying.</i>

44:28.624 --> 44:31.960
<i>You could have chose any moment</i>
<i>to torture me, but you chose this one.</i>

44:32.044 --> 44:34.880
<i>But that's because this is obviously</i>
<i>the most painful moment for you.</i>

44:34.963 --> 44:38.092
<i>Right, and for sure this doesn't</i>
<i>resonate with you at all.</i>

44:38.175 --> 44:40.260
<i>This has nothing to do with me.</i>

44:41.345 --> 44:43.138
<i>I am here because I'm the King of Hell.</i>

44:43.222 --> 44:45.182
<i>This is my job. This is my duty.</i>

44:45.265 --> 44:47.101
<i>Now who's making excuses?</i>

44:48.727 --> 44:50.187
<i>But I should know, right?</i>

44:50.688 --> 44:52.815
<i>I mean, I spent my whole life making them,</i>

44:53.232 --> 44:59.571
<i>and a million bullshit reasons why I went</i>
<i>15 years without talking to my family.</i>

45:01.031 --> 45:04.159
<i>I mean, the truth is I should have just</i>
<i>got out of the damn car</i>

45:04.618 --> 45:06.453
<i>and walked through that door.</i>

45:09.123 --> 45:10.749
<i>I missed my chance.</i>

<i>What about you?</i>

45:14.586 --> 45:15.462
<i>[scoffs]</i>

45:16.922 --> 45:21.510
<i>The self-centered simplicity of you humans</i>

<i>How can you presume</i>
<i>to compare yourself to me?</i>

45:29.560 --> 45:32.187
<i>I am here out of responsibility.</i>

45:32.271 --> 45:34.314
<i>Demons were in full revolt.</i>

<i>and they're gonna have to reload.</i>

45:52.332 --> 45:53.542
<i>That's when you're gonna run.</i>

45:53.625 --> 45:54.960
<i>I'll draw their fire. You ready?</i>

45:55.043 --> 45:56.670
<i>No, no, no, I can't.</i>
<i>No, I can't!</i>

45:56.754 --> 45:58.255
<i>Meg, listen to me.</i>

45:58.839 --> 46:01.300
