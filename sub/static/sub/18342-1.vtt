WEBVTT

00:55.459 --> 00:56.830
Whoosh.

00:56.917 --> 00:59.918
Hurry up, everyone,
or we'll miss our train.

01:00.751 --> 01:02.921
Anyone seen Roger?

01:03.001 --> 01:07.252
- Look out! Pirates on the starboard bow.
- Someone fetch Roger.

01:07.334 --> 01:10.379
- Prepare to fire the cannon.
- Taxi's waiting.

01:10.459 --> 01:13.170
Aye aye, Captain. Boom!

01:13.251 --> 01:15.629
Missed, you blackguards!

01:15.709 --> 01:17.129
Taxi's here.

01:17.209 --> 01:19.629
You'll never take me alive.

01:19.709 --> 01:21.250
Cheerio, then, have a nice summer.

01:28.084 --> 01:31.215
If I close my eyes,
that mess just won't be there.

01:42.042 --> 01:43.833
Come along.

01:44.417 --> 01:46.748
Come on, nearly there.

01:51.542 --> 01:57.133
The train now standing at platform
one is the 0900 hours to Glasgow.

01:57.792 --> 02:00.383
- Calling at Southampton, Oxford...
- Ooh.

02:02.251 --> 02:04.962
You need to watch where you're going.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.421
Or you might not get there.

02:07.501 --> 02:08.542
Woof!

02:11.792 --> 02:13.583
Go on.

02:19.959 --> 02:23.750
- Here we are. I need to sit down.
- Bagsy the window.

02:23.834 --> 02:26.171
Good girl. You got it?

02:26.251 --> 02:28.542
- Stop it, Roger.
- No.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.077
Do as you're told, Roger.

02:33.917 --> 02:38.128
- I wish Father was here.
- I know, darling. We all do.

02:38.209 --> 02:42.129
But he has to go with his ship.
That's what being a captain means.

02:42.209 --> 02:44.540
- Where is his ship?
- Hong Kong.

02:44.626 --> 02:47.207
- Where's Hong Kong?
- The South China Sea.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.793
- Where's the South China Sea?
- South of China.

02:49.876 --> 02:51.667
He left you these, though.

02:54.126 --> 02:55.747
To say "happy holiday".

02:59.542 --> 03:01.671
He's given me a book on the stars.

03:01.751 --> 03:04.422
A journal. I can write
hundreds of stories now.

03:05.042 --> 03:07.503
- This is Father's knife.
- He left you a note.

03:10.501 --> 03:13.962
"Dear John, I'm giving you my knife
so you can whittle sticks, cut rope,

03:14.042 --> 03:16.293
and fight off Tatty's pirates.

03:16.376 --> 03:19.457
I'm so sorry I can't be there
to do that with you. Father."

03:20.709 --> 03:24.380
All aboard! This train is ready to leave!

03:27.167 --> 03:30.168
- I want a knife.
- When you're John's age.

04:35.626 --> 04:37.207
Ohh.

04:37.792 --> 04:40.003
- Excuse me.
- You're excused.

04:52.001 --> 04:55.921
- Sorry, but this compartment's taken.
- Our mother will be back in a minute.

04:56.001 --> 04:57.832
Good for her.

04:58.626 --> 04:59.667
Hey!

05:01.751 --> 05:03.582
Sorry, mate. No room at the inn.

05:03.667 --> 05:07.328
Unless you wanna bunk up
with my five noisy young'uns.

05:07.417 --> 05:09.918
Oh, no, that's all right. Thank you.

05:11.417 --> 05:13.288
Put her down.

05:22.959 --> 05:27.750
Not a word of this to anyone,
or I will find you and I will shut you up.

05:28.917 --> 05:33.418
And I will set my pirates on you and you.
Be warned.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.458
What's he doing?

05:40.542 --> 05:42.503
Shut the window, quick!

05:47.042 --> 05:50.421
- Who was that?
- A pirate, obviously.

05:50.501 --> 05:52.422
I don't like that man.

06:02.834 --> 06:04.295
Everything all right?

06:07.167 --> 06:09.958
Mother, er... there was this erm...

06:10.542 --> 06:12.253
Tatty!

06:12.334 --> 06:14.715
Don't be horrible to Roger.

06:17.459 --> 06:19.750
Excuse me, madam,
I was looking for your husband.

06:19.834 --> 06:23.465
My husband? He's in Hong Kong.

06:24.459 --> 06:27.460
Oh, I do apologise. Wrong husband.

07:02.292 --> 07:03.793
Ringman!

07:04.626 --> 07:06.497
You're travelling light.

07:07.334 --> 07:10.379
- Where's the rest of it?
- Coming by road.

07:10.459 --> 07:12.580
- Hello, Mr Jackson.
- Hello, Mr Jackson.

07:12.667 --> 07:13.878
Thank you.

07:13.959 --> 07:15.960
Who wants to ride
in the back of the truck?

07:16.042 --> 07:18.333
- Me! I do!
- No, me!

07:29.834 --> 07:32.175
- There's Holly Howe!
- Look, Roger. There's one!

07:36.501 --> 07:37.752
Look, John!

07:37.834 --> 07:40.675
We're here. Hello, Mrs Jackson!

07:43.209 --> 07:44.790
Stay.

07:46.251 --> 07:48.962
- Roger, look at the sheep.
- Stay, lad, stay.

07:49.042 --> 07:50.421
Wow.

07:50.501 --> 07:54.379
- Look at that black one.
- All present and accounted for.

07:54.459 --> 07:57.790
- You've grown a bit.
- Mrs Jackson, I've grown, too.

07:58.292 --> 08:01.462
Have you now?
See you've not got any quieter, mind.

08:01.542 --> 08:03.212
Father's in Hong Kong.

08:03.292 --> 08:05.583
Is he now? I expect he's glad of the rest.

08:06.334 --> 08:08.335
Same rooms as last year?

08:08.417 --> 08:12.748
- Can we go up to Darien first?
- You're lucky I'm too tired to say no.

08:12.834 --> 08:16.504
- Race you to Darien Peak.
- Tea's at six. Not a minute later, mind.

08:16.584 --> 08:20.675
- That means you, too, Mr Jackson.
- You know me, Mrs Jackson.

08:33.376 --> 08:34.876
Come on.

08:43.292 --> 08:44.963
There's our lake.

08:45.751 --> 08:48.671
It's not our lake.
We're just visiting our holiday abode.

08:48.751 --> 08:53.332
- What's an abode?
- A house. Susan swallowed a dictionary.

08:53.417 --> 08:56.828
The undiscovered island. It's still there!

08:56.917 --> 09:00.038
Islands can't go anywhere.
You have to go to it.

09:00.126 --> 09:02.537
Father said he'd take us this year.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.667
Father's not here.

09:08.126 --> 09:10.077
I've just had a brilliant idea.

09:10.167 --> 09:13.128
- Come on.
- I know how to get us there.

09:30.959 --> 09:32.380
She's a beauty, in't she?

09:35.584 --> 09:37.295
She could do with a run out.

09:39.042 --> 09:42.083
I don't get the time so much these days.

09:43.001 --> 09:45.632
I's too busy chasing sheep.

09:47.334 --> 09:48.835
Crumbs.

09:56.167 --> 09:59.418
Please, Mother.
We'll live there for ever and ever.

09:59.501 --> 10:02.212
- Not for ever. Just for the holidays.
- We could camp.

10:02.292 --> 10:03.671
We'll sleep under the stars.

10:03.751 --> 10:05.879
We'll build huts out of leaves and sticks.

10:05.959 --> 10:09.250
Hunt goats, skin them.
Then roast them on a fire.

10:09.334 --> 10:10.835
I don't like goats.

10:10.917 --> 10:13.208
They won't like you much
if you roast them on a fire.

10:13.292 --> 10:17.083
John's captain. We're his crew.
We set sail tomorrow in Swallow.

10:17.167 --> 10:20.628
Oh, do you now? And what does Mr Jackson
have to say about that?

10:20.709 --> 10:22.460
He doesn't mind. He's very kind.

10:23.167 --> 10:25.748
- I am very kind.
- Yeah, the wrong kind.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.712
John's never sailed all of you
across the lake before.

10:28.792 --> 10:31.503
And the island's three miles away
at least.

10:31.584 --> 10:34.795
No, but I can do it.
Father said I did really well last year.

10:34.876 --> 10:39.577
I can't let you go off into the unknown
without Father and I discussing it first.

10:40.709 --> 10:45.080
How about we set up camp
in the garden instead?

10:46.834 --> 10:48.879
Couldn't you write to Father
and discuss it?

10:48.959 --> 10:54.130
We can all write.
Please, Mother. It's our destiny!

10:57.626 --> 10:59.827
- All right, then.
- Let's get the pencils!

10:59.917 --> 11:01.878
Don't forget the 'destiny' part.

11:01.959 --> 11:04.460
Supper first. Letters later. Pencils away.

11:04.542 --> 11:07.129
Mind, mind! It's hot.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.080
What is it?

11:09.167 --> 11:11.078
Goat.

11:12.959 --> 11:17.250
- How long will the letter take?
- To a ship in the South China Sea?

11:17.334 --> 11:19.171
Anything up to three weeks.

11:19.251 --> 11:21.582
But it's a matter of life and death.

11:21.667 --> 11:25.998
In life and death situations,
it's advisable to send a telegram.

11:28.126 --> 11:32.787
I'd better do it, darling.
Telegrams have to be short.

11:34.751 --> 11:37.379
Come on, Roger, let's get a fishing net.

11:37.459 --> 11:39.000
Coming!

11:42.042 --> 11:43.713
Slow down!

11:46.501 --> 11:47.882
Hello.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.130
Hello.

11:51.126 --> 11:52.997
I understand you've got rooms to let.

11:53.084 --> 11:56.754
I'm afraid I only have one left.
Because of the carnival.

11:56.834 --> 11:58.879
Oh, well, one will be adequate.

11:58.959 --> 12:00.750
I can assure you it's more than adequate.

12:00.834 --> 12:04.212
- Does it have two beds?
- Naturally.

12:04.292 --> 12:08.083
- Breakfast included?
- Breakfast won't be necessary, thanks.

12:08.751 --> 12:11.172
- Are you here for the fishing?
- Of a kind.

12:11.834 --> 12:16.755
We're writers chasing a story,
but... keep that to yourself.

12:17.501 --> 12:19.922
If you knew how many secrets
I'm party to...

12:20.542 --> 12:22.793
I'm like the tomb.

12:22.876 --> 12:26.667
Maybe you know an old newspaper colleague
of ours. We believe he lives round here.

12:26.751 --> 12:30.421
There's just the one newspaper man
round here. Jim Turner.

12:30.501 --> 12:34.379
But he's away a lot. He's a travel writer.
So he says.

12:34.459 --> 12:37.250
Yes, that's him. Good old Jim.

12:37.334 --> 12:39.171
No, it must be a different Jim.

12:39.251 --> 12:42.671
I'm not one to gossip
but this one can be very rude.

12:42.751 --> 12:45.962
We'll have to have a stern word with him.
Have you seen him recently?

12:46.042 --> 12:50.753
Haven't seen sight nor sound. He lives
on the lake in an eyesore of a boat.

12:50.834 --> 12:53.921
On the lake? That sounds romantic.

12:54.001 --> 12:56.422
Given the right circumstances.

12:57.251 --> 13:00.292
- Where does he keep his boat?
- Could be anywhere.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.335
He moves it all the time.

13:03.959 --> 13:05.580
That's a very big lake.

13:18.417 --> 13:20.168
There's something down there!

13:20.251 --> 13:22.962
Wait for me. Wait for me!

13:23.042 --> 13:25.833
I'm going to catch you, Roger!

13:30.834 --> 13:33.171
- What's that?
- A houseboat.

13:33.251 --> 13:38.502
It's deserted. The crew must have drowned
in a terrible storm.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.085
I'd like to live on a boat.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.958
Father lives on a boat.

13:42.834 --> 13:44.925
He lives on a destroyer.

13:48.167 --> 13:50.288
Look for the flat stones.

13:51.709 --> 13:53.130
Is that flat?

13:56.084 --> 13:57.885
John!

13:59.459 --> 14:01.080
We're for it now.

14:01.167 --> 14:02.998
It's just an old boat.
There's nobody on it.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.212
Thank you, children.

14:21.292 --> 14:23.253
Thank you.

14:23.334 --> 14:25.879
He thinks he gave us the slip
on the train.

14:25.959 --> 14:29.540
Well, let's let him think that, for now.

14:42.542 --> 14:43.793
Susan!

14:45.626 --> 14:47.457
Susan.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.253
It's the man from the train.

14:50.542 --> 14:52.253
He is a pirate.

14:52.334 --> 14:54.795
- Stop making things up!
- Look!

14:55.709 --> 15:01.129
Look at that strange boat. It's Captain
Flint and his parrot. Run away!

15:01.209 --> 15:04.750
Mrs Walker, can you come
down a minute, please?

15:04.834 --> 15:09.085
I'm sorry about your boat, Mr Turner, but
I'm not sure what it's got to do with us.

15:09.167 --> 15:12.958
Mrs Jackson says you've got quite
a brood. And I saw four children.

15:13.042 --> 15:17.083
- That hardly means that they were mine.
- All right, well show me I'm wrong.

15:17.667 --> 15:21.288
- Are you always this rude?
- That was me being polite.

15:21.376 --> 15:23.537
Weren't you on our train?

15:24.417 --> 15:26.038
No, I never travel by train.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.037
- That's a lie.
- Keep schtum.

15:35.584 --> 15:39.635
John, tell Mr Turner
you didn't break his window.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.750
This must be yours.

15:47.834 --> 15:51.585
John, apologise at once.

15:52.917 --> 15:56.248
It was an accident. John didn't mean to.

15:57.626 --> 16:00.127
- And that's the man that...
- I'm sorry.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.040
All right.

16:02.709 --> 16:04.500
Well, we'll say no more about it.

16:04.584 --> 16:07.965
But just a word to the wise.
If you go near my boat again...

16:09.251 --> 16:11.421
I won't be quite so understanding
next time.

16:11.501 --> 16:13.252
Thank you.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.328
John will pay for the damage.

16:18.334 --> 16:21.505
No wonder he's single.
Even his own sister finds him impossible.

16:22.084 --> 16:25.254
Who knows what's going on in that boat?
Something fishy.

16:25.334 --> 16:26.835
And I don't mean with nets.

16:26.917 --> 16:28.828
You should have told me straightaway.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.378
Sorry.

16:30.459 --> 16:34.880
You need to be more responsible, John,
just as I know you can be.

16:36.834 --> 16:39.795
Go on, go to bed. All of you.

16:40.709 --> 16:44.379
I told you he was a pirate.

16:44.459 --> 16:47.080
Well done. Mother won't let us
go to the island now.

16:47.167 --> 16:49.498
This is the worst holiday ever.

16:58.209 --> 17:00.170
The postman.

17:03.459 --> 17:05.210
Door.

17:18.001 --> 17:20.002
- There you go, lad.
- Thank you.

17:24.584 --> 17:26.545
It's arrived!

17:29.251 --> 17:32.002
- Mine!
- Stop it, I'm being a ship!

17:32.084 --> 17:33.835
I want to give it to Mother.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.628
Excellent sailing.

17:37.584 --> 17:39.925
- Is it dispatches?
- Can I read it?

17:40.334 --> 17:43.085
It's written in special captain's code.

17:43.167 --> 17:44.828
Betterlet John read it.

17:50.126 --> 17:51.327
What's so funny?

17:51.417 --> 17:55.788
"Better drowned than duffers.
If not duffers, won't drown."

17:55.876 --> 17:57.377
What's a duffer?

17:57.459 --> 18:01.790
That's Father's name for somebody who's...
who's not very good at anything.

18:01.876 --> 18:03.497
Then I'm not a duffer.

18:03.584 --> 18:08.629
Then you won't drown. And if you do,
then you are. And good riddance.

18:08.709 --> 18:11.250
- Without the 'good riddance' bit.
- But does it say yes?

18:11.334 --> 18:13.215
That's up to mother.

18:15.751 --> 18:19.752
Father trusts me. Or he wouldn't have
sent the telegram, would he?

18:19.834 --> 18:21.254
But can I trust you?

18:21.334 --> 18:24.421
Yes. And I promise
I'll look after everybody.

18:24.501 --> 18:27.252
And you can have a nice rest
from all our noise.

18:27.334 --> 18:28.635
Please say yes.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.168
You'll need some tents.

18:34.251 --> 18:36.882
- Hooray, hooray!
- And plenty of supplies.

18:38.459 --> 18:40.960
- Where will we get tents?
- Mr and Mrs Jackson have some.

18:41.042 --> 18:42.793
Roger, stay here, pet.

18:45.001 --> 18:48.712
You, me and Vicky are going to have
a lovely time.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.628
You can't swim well enough, darling.

18:55.709 --> 18:57.000
Roger.

18:58.626 --> 19:00.497
Roger!

19:29.209 --> 19:31.790
Well, if you fall in, you won't be
in your bathing suit.

19:34.084 --> 19:35.712
Come on, Roger! Come on!

19:35.792 --> 19:39.543
Good boy, Roger. Don't look at me,
darling, look at Susan.

19:39.626 --> 19:43.787
Come on. You're doing so well.
I didn't know you could swim this well.

19:45.917 --> 19:48.998
Come on! Come on, Roger!

19:50.626 --> 19:54.377
Come on, a little bit further.
Nearly there now!

19:55.334 --> 19:58.085
- Yes!
- Yes!

19:58.167 --> 19:59.918
Good swimming, Roger.

20:02.459 --> 20:04.290
I can go!

20:09.584 --> 20:11.465
Stay there, ladies.

20:12.001 --> 20:15.421
Betty, get back here
or you'll go in the pot!

20:15.501 --> 20:18.752
Pull, pull. Pull, pull.

20:20.834 --> 20:23.255
That goes round there. Loop it over.

20:24.209 --> 20:26.170
There we have it. How's that, Mrs Jackson?

20:26.251 --> 20:30.421
I don't know how you get through these.
Do you walk out in the yard in them?

20:31.626 --> 20:32.957
One, two, three.

20:35.542 --> 20:37.883
And then fill up the pockets with stones.

20:39.167 --> 20:40.708
Are you going to help?

20:40.792 --> 20:42.713
Essentials only, mind.

21:06.417 --> 21:08.918
After all that, no wind.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.002
We'll have to whistle for it.

21:15.917 --> 21:18.538
Come on, John. You have to.

21:18.626 --> 21:20.577
No, it's stupid.

21:39.709 --> 21:42.250
Swallows for ever.

21:55.501 --> 21:57.502
Wait for me!

22:00.334 --> 22:02.135
He gets seasick.

22:02.751 --> 22:05.712
Captain John will now introduce his crew.

22:06.542 --> 22:09.379
Able Seaman Tatty Walker.
In charge of the ship's log.

22:09.459 --> 22:13.580
It's very important to keep a record
of a voyage for posterity.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.628
Ship's Boy Roger Walker.

22:15.709 --> 22:19.920
I don't want to be ship's boy.
I want to be lookout.

22:20.001 --> 22:23.542
That's what the ship's boy does.
Keep your eyes peeled.

22:24.126 --> 22:25.707
Master Mate Susan Walker.

22:25.792 --> 22:29.713
- Master Mate, sure you've got everything?
- Mm-hm.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.129
- Oh.
- Remember Tatty can't use matches.

22:34.209 --> 22:35.790
Hmph!

22:36.501 --> 22:39.629
- You've a fine crew here, Captain.
- Aye aye, Mother.

22:39.709 --> 22:42.250
- Here's the wind, lad.
- All aboard!

22:45.417 --> 22:48.578
You might as well take this. Although
I know how much you all hate cake.

22:48.667 --> 22:51.668
Big cheer for Mrs Jackson. Hip hip...

22:51.751 --> 22:53.002
Hooray!

22:53.084 --> 22:56.295
Here's to Swallow and all who sail in her.

22:58.042 --> 22:59.629
Bye.

22:59.709 --> 23:02.080
- Bye!
- Bye!

23:02.667 --> 23:05.958
Remember, keep your eye on the flag
and you won't miss a gybe.

23:06.042 --> 23:08.833
I want that boat back in one piece.

23:08.917 --> 23:11.918
Or Mr Jackson will have
your guts for garters.

23:12.001 --> 23:16.212
And no sailing at night. That's one of the
deepest lakes in the whole of England!

23:17.709 --> 23:19.500
They'll be back before tea.

23:47.709 --> 23:49.670
Prepare the chart, Able Seaman Tatty.

23:49.751 --> 23:51.462
Aye aye, Captain.

23:51.542 --> 23:53.629
Is this the South China Sea?

23:53.709 --> 23:56.880
Er... I think we're here.

23:57.626 --> 24:00.037
We still have miles to go.

24:25.792 --> 24:27.583
Gybe ho!

24:31.292 --> 24:34.083
- Look what you made me do.
- It wasn't my fault.

24:34.167 --> 24:36.668
It was. You're meant to keep your eye
on the flag.

24:36.751 --> 24:40.292
Hey, I'm the captain, you're only the
mate. You can't tell me what to do.

24:40.376 --> 24:42.077
That's all our food!

24:43.709 --> 24:45.379
Wait, I think I can get it.

24:45.459 --> 24:48.790
It's like the man-overboard test
father taught me.

24:50.292 --> 24:52.462
- Ready, boat?
- Ready!

24:52.542 --> 24:54.543
Lee ho!

25:04.626 --> 25:08.327
Susan, when I give you the signal,
grab the box. And don't mess it up.

25:08.792 --> 25:10.293
I never messed it up.

25:11.417 --> 25:13.668
Steady. Steady now.

25:14.876 --> 25:16.827
Steady, not too fast.

25:21.042 --> 25:22.793
- Now, Susan!
- No, John!

25:23.876 --> 25:25.377
It's sinking!

25:29.417 --> 25:33.168
If that was a man,
he would be fish food by now.

25:34.292 --> 25:38.213
Now look what you've done, stupid.
Now we're gonna starve to death.

25:38.876 --> 25:41.827
That was your fault.
You're a terrible captain.

25:41.917 --> 25:44.038
You're a terrible crew.

25:46.084 --> 25:48.215
I don't want to starve to death.

25:49.292 --> 25:51.212
I want to go home.

25:51.292 --> 25:53.921
No, only cowards turn back.

25:54.001 --> 25:56.332
This is our destiny, John.

26:10.167 --> 26:11.828
There it is, look!

26:31.334 --> 26:34.925
- There's nowhere to land.
- We have to go closer.

26:51.834 --> 26:54.965
Over there! There's a little beach.

27:09.709 --> 27:11.460
We made it!

27:15.417 --> 27:17.708
Go on, Tatty, you name it.

27:19.126 --> 27:24.747
I hereby name this Walker Island
and claim it for our own.

27:25.584 --> 27:27.629
Swallows for ever!

27:30.626 --> 27:33.417
At last!

27:33.501 --> 27:35.712
Whoo-hoo!

27:37.626 --> 27:39.127
Wheee!

27:40.084 --> 27:44.465
We're on an island
in the middle of a giant ocean!

28:24.542 --> 28:26.333
This is the place.

28:35.792 --> 28:38.673
I wonder if a bear lives here?

28:43.209 --> 28:44.460
Look what I've found.

28:47.834 --> 28:52.835
- It's a fireplace.
- You know what this means? Pirates!

28:59.084 --> 29:01.212
Are they coming back?

29:01.292 --> 29:04.753
No. It's just some old fireplace
that hasn't been used in years.

29:04.834 --> 29:07.045
- Can I light it?
- You're not allowed to use matches.

29:11.251 --> 29:13.422
The matches were in the box with the food.

29:14.834 --> 29:17.295
- Great.
- I'm hungry.

29:17.376 --> 29:19.287
Well, this is fun.

29:25.042 --> 29:28.423
They'll be wanting hot food
when they get here.

29:29.084 --> 29:31.504
I used to camp out for days
when I was their age.

29:31.584 --> 29:35.254
Did you now?
Do they let city folk camp in parks?

29:35.334 --> 29:39.335
I wouldn't know. I grew up in the
Highlands. The hills were my park.

29:39.417 --> 29:42.878
Big parks, those. Wouldn't wanna be
a park-keeper, mind.

29:42.959 --> 29:46.420
Hard enough getting certain folk
to mow the lawn around here.

29:52.876 --> 29:55.127
We're Walkers, Mrs Jackson.

29:56.876 --> 29:59.537
We don't give in that easily.

30:03.334 --> 30:06.585
- Oh, my gosh, it's so wet.
- Quick, quick, quick.

30:06.667 --> 30:08.708
No, no! No, they're mine!

30:08.792 --> 30:10.673
No!

30:12.042 --> 30:14.833
- Quick, quick, quick!
- We're done! We're done!

30:16.876 --> 30:18.917
- We're done!
- We win!

30:19.001 --> 30:21.212
You're not in, you're not in.

30:21.292 --> 30:23.213
I think we won that one.

30:27.542 --> 30:29.963
I'm starving to death here.

30:30.834 --> 30:32.215
Me, too.

30:38.209 --> 30:40.170
Mrs Jackson's cake!

30:40.251 --> 30:42.962
Oh, food! Cake!

30:49.292 --> 30:51.333
- I love cake.
- Let me get a bit.

30:51.417 --> 30:52.958
Don't hog it.

31:02.292 --> 31:03.543
Look.

31:04.459 --> 31:06.210
Fire.

31:07.917 --> 31:09.378
It's gone.

31:11.042 --> 31:13.003
I wish we had a fire.

31:16.626 --> 31:18.207
No sign, then?

31:21.417 --> 31:23.288
More gumption than I gave them credit for.

31:23.376 --> 31:27.957
I'm so glad they can come up here
and do all the things I took for granted.

31:28.042 --> 31:32.833
They're cooped up inside too much
at home. It's not good for them.

31:33.917 --> 31:36.168
I don't want them frightened of the world.

31:36.251 --> 31:38.042
Yeah, you're right, lass.

31:39.751 --> 31:43.332
If life was always 'early to bed',
we'd never learn owt.

31:58.376 --> 32:00.037
Boo!

32:01.042 --> 32:02.793
Mother gave it to me.

32:11.251 --> 32:12.922
- Goodnight.
- Night.

32:27.917 --> 32:30.128
You should see the stars.

32:31.292 --> 32:33.713
They're never like this in Portsmouth.

32:35.876 --> 32:37.827
I wish I had a knife.

32:38.917 --> 32:41.128
To fight off the pirates.

32:42.834 --> 32:44.755
There aren't any pirates.

32:45.167 --> 32:46.828
That's just a game.

32:52.959 --> 32:54.670
Night, you lot.

32:55.334 --> 32:59.085
Alloallocallacazabraoolatcasoola!

32:59.459 --> 33:02.790
- What?
- That's 'Island' for 'goodnight'.

33:06.001 --> 33:11.332
So the exhausted crew settled down
for their first night on dry land.

33:11.417 --> 33:17.418
Able Seaman Tatty kept watch,
the threat of danger always upon them.

33:17.501 --> 33:20.132
It was going to be a long night.

33:28.751 --> 33:31.629
It's dark, he's alone.
What are we waiting for?

33:31.709 --> 33:35.540
Don't be so impatient. He'll have to make
contact with his superiors soon.

33:35.626 --> 33:39.287
We need that name and the Secret Service
don't hand them out on business cards.

33:39.376 --> 33:44.287
We could just go and ask him.
Then kill him. Go home. Have some dinner.

33:44.376 --> 33:45.577
You know our orders.

33:54.917 --> 33:59.958
It's not just him we're after.
The papers are somewhere on that boat.

34:29.251 --> 34:30.422
John...

34:32.333 --> 34:34.462
we're on the island!

34:34.542 --> 34:37.670
Where did you think we were? You coming?

34:37.751 --> 34:39.422
Where are you going?

34:39.542 --> 34:43.003
On a top secret mission. You'll see.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.925
- Are you going to wake the others?
- No.

34:46.708 --> 34:48.500
Wait a minute.

35:00.209 --> 35:02.000
What's the mission?

35:02.084 --> 35:04.045
To find the secret of fire.

35:32.501 --> 35:34.542
Where are they?

35:34.626 --> 35:38.077
How should I know?
Nobody tells me anything.

35:39.292 --> 35:42.333
You need to do your teeth.
I'll get your toothbrush.

35:51.251 --> 35:52.882
Roger?

35:54.126 --> 35:55.877
Roger?

36:10.376 --> 36:11.377
Susan!

36:12.917 --> 36:15.578
The pirates have killed John and Tatty.

36:16.001 --> 36:17.712
There's Tatty's skull.

36:22.001 --> 36:24.042
That's not Tatty.

36:24.667 --> 36:27.538
"No trespassing. Danger of death."

36:27.626 --> 36:29.747
That sounds bad.

36:29.834 --> 36:32.335
Signed: "The Amazons."

36:38.042 --> 36:40.171
How much further?

36:40.251 --> 36:42.382
Who knows? We have to keep going.

36:43.751 --> 36:45.879
I want to go back!

36:45.959 --> 36:49.750
Come on, Tatty Mouse, you can do it.
I didn't know you could climb so well.

37:05.584 --> 37:07.545
Who lives here?

37:22.626 --> 37:25.457
Oooh! Yuck!

37:42.292 --> 37:44.462
Snake got your tongue, has he?

37:46.917 --> 37:50.078
He won't hurt youse unless youse hurt him,

37:50.167 --> 37:52.878
and then he'll bite and bite good.

37:53.459 --> 37:55.500
Identify yourselves.

37:55.584 --> 37:59.462
- Er... I'm John Walker.
- Captain John Walker.

37:59.542 --> 38:00.921
Captain, eh?

38:01.001 --> 38:04.542
I'm Able Seaman Tatty Walker,
aged nine-and-a-half.

38:04.626 --> 38:09.577
Our ship landed on an undiscovered island
but we lost all our stores overboard.

38:09.667 --> 38:12.128
That was careless of your captain.

38:12.209 --> 38:15.750
We saw your fires and we need to know
how to make one.

38:15.834 --> 38:18.135
It's a matter of life and death.

38:22.459 --> 38:24.250
I've got something.

38:24.334 --> 38:27.085
I've got something, too. Reel it in.

38:31.959 --> 38:34.920
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

38:40.959 --> 38:43.580
Yuck, it's an old coat.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.418
Well, we can't cook that.

38:45.501 --> 38:50.132
We need a good straight stick
and a good dry piece of bark.

38:52.459 --> 38:54.540
Get a tight grip between your hands.

38:57.459 --> 38:59.290
And you push into it.

39:00.417 --> 39:01.788
See?

39:01.876 --> 39:03.877
It's smoking already.

39:07.501 --> 39:09.042
Embers.

39:09.126 --> 39:10.327
Spark of life.

39:12.126 --> 39:15.417
Now, you throw this
into your tinder stack.

39:17.251 --> 39:18.832
And you pick it up.

39:18.917 --> 39:21.288
- Pick it up?
- Don't be frightened.

39:21.626 --> 39:23.377
Look, see?

39:40.709 --> 39:42.290
It's like magic!

39:46.001 --> 39:47.752
Are you on your boat, Captain?

39:49.084 --> 39:51.295
There's an old houseboat out on the lake.

39:52.376 --> 39:54.537
Can you take a message
to the man who lives on it?

39:54.626 --> 39:56.827
You mean Captain Flint?

39:56.917 --> 40:00.038
So that's his name.

40:00.126 --> 40:03.497
We know him by his alias. Jim Turner.

40:03.584 --> 40:07.585
Tell him two strangers been going about
asking a lot of questions.

40:07.667 --> 40:10.538
Tell him Old Billy
thought he'd want to know.

40:11.334 --> 40:14.175
But don't hang about.
He don't like visitors.

40:18.459 --> 40:22.250
Don't youse forget now.
A good straight stick and a piece of bark.

40:22.334 --> 40:24.925
And if that don't work... try these.

40:29.417 --> 40:31.708
Do you eat them with the head on?

40:31.792 --> 40:33.423
I'm not sure.

40:34.209 --> 40:35.790
People eat brains, though.

40:37.834 --> 40:39.585
I think we'd better take it off.

40:39.667 --> 40:41.248
Will it hurt it?

40:41.334 --> 40:43.962
It's dead. It won't feel a thing.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.583
You're making a dog's dinner of that.

40:46.667 --> 40:47.958
Eugh!

40:50.667 --> 40:51.878
Down.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.708
Who are they?

40:56.417 --> 40:57.748
Amazon.

40:59.501 --> 41:01.712
That was the name on the sign.

41:03.584 --> 41:05.175
The Jolly Roger.

41:06.459 --> 41:08.830
I don't feel very jolly.

41:15.084 --> 41:16.885
He's left the door open.

41:19.876 --> 41:24.377
This is our chance. I'll search the boat,
you follow him.

41:24.459 --> 41:26.960
See if he tries to make contact.

41:32.292 --> 41:34.923
Stay here. I won't be long.

41:38.709 --> 41:40.460
Hello?

41:50.709 --> 41:53.040
- Hello.
- Hello.

42:47.709 --> 42:50.170
So you're not just a vandal.
You're a spy, too.

42:52.626 --> 42:55.497
I'm not a vandal. Or a spy.

42:58.459 --> 43:00.920
Then why are you snooping
through my things?

43:01.001 --> 43:04.002
- I came to give you a message.
- I'm sure you did.

43:09.251 --> 43:10.422
You're a liar.

43:11.751 --> 43:15.042
You broke my window and you didn't own up.

43:16.209 --> 43:18.129
Lying is not very brave, is it?

43:18.209 --> 43:20.920
I bet your father
must be very disappointed.

43:21.001 --> 43:24.042
- I'm not a liar.
- Yes, you are.

43:24.126 --> 43:27.667
And you're scared, too. Aren't you?

43:27.751 --> 43:31.752
I know about fear, John,
and I can see it in your eyes.

43:33.834 --> 43:37.379
Now you're trespassing on private
property which is a criminal offence.

43:37.459 --> 43:40.080
I only came to give you a message.
Do you want to hear it?

43:40.167 --> 43:43.918
No, I do not want to hear
another word from you.

43:46.501 --> 43:47.632
Clear off.

43:53.626 --> 43:56.627
You denied being on our train.
You're the liar.

43:59.292 --> 44:01.213
You're hiding from someone.

44:11.167 --> 44:14.168
If I were you,
I would forget about that...

44:15.376 --> 44:17.377
and everything you've seen on here.

44:18.542 --> 44:20.423
This is not a game.

44:21.667 --> 44:25.128
Do you understand? This is not a game.

44:43.542 --> 44:45.633
The boy's seen what he's hiding.

44:46.667 --> 44:49.498
He'll have to make contact
with his superior now.

45:02.042 --> 45:04.213
What did he say to you, John?

45:06.167 --> 45:08.128
Nothing.

45:09.751 --> 45:11.252
They just shot at us.

45:11.334 --> 45:15.795
Captain Flint's pirates.
He set them on us.

45:15.876 --> 45:19.417
They're not getting away with that.
We're going back to get the others.

45:19.501 --> 45:21.082
We need a full crew.

45:33.542 --> 45:37.212
- They were in a boat.
- It's from the pirates that shot at us.

45:37.292 --> 45:38.793
Look.

45:41.542 --> 45:42.963
What does this mean?

45:47.459 --> 45:49.500
This means war.

45:51.001 --> 45:54.502
You can't declare war without discussing
it with your second in command. Me.

45:54.584 --> 45:56.462
You're supposed to tell me everything.

45:56.542 --> 46:00.129
And you shouldn't have gone off like that.
It was irresponsible.

46:00.209 --> 46:01.920
We were on a top secret mission.

46:02.001 --> 46:03.542
What top secret mission?

46:03.626 --> 46:05.457
To discover the secret of fire.

46:05.542 --> 46:07.793
Just come. Please.

46:10.667 --> 46:13.538
Come on, we've got to find them,
show them the island's ours.

46:15.792 --> 46:18.963
- There they are.
- I wanted to say that.

46:24.167 --> 46:25.998
Those pirates look mean.

46:27.459 --> 46:28.790
Hey!

46:29.834 --> 46:32.965
Come on, we can catch them.

46:45.292 --> 46:46.673
We can catch them.

46:54.126 --> 46:55.827
Come on!

46:57.709 --> 46:59.420
We're getting closer.

47:03.626 --> 47:05.247
Give me those.

47:17.792 --> 47:19.423
Faster, John.

47:20.042 --> 47:22.083
We've got to sail closer to the wind.

47:23.459 --> 47:25.380
We're losing them.

47:32.542 --> 47:33.883
They're getting away.

47:37.626 --> 47:40.327
Gosh, they're really good.

47:43.126 --> 47:45.327
They're much faster than us.

47:49.001 --> 47:50.882
We've lost them.

47:52.167 --> 47:55.378
I can see that.
But thanks for letting me know.

47:56.584 --> 48:02.005
Look, they're changing course.
Maybe they're heading for Rio.

48:02.584 --> 48:03.885
Set course for Rio.

48:13.042 --> 48:15.129
It's not really called Rio, Tatty.

48:15.209 --> 48:19.000
I'm a writer. We make everything up.

48:23.542 --> 48:25.173
It's carnival day.

48:27.584 --> 48:28.925
They're not here.

48:29.876 --> 48:33.787
Well, we're here now and we have to buy
food. Everyone's famished.

48:33.876 --> 48:36.287
Well, we'd better be quick about it.

48:37.334 --> 48:40.085
Wait, someone needs to stay with the boat.

48:40.167 --> 48:43.578
Roger, you're in charge of the boat.
Stay here, we won't be long.

48:48.334 --> 48:51.175
But you're the lookout.
And that's a very important job.

48:53.167 --> 48:54.748
I'll do it...

48:55.584 --> 48:57.085
if you let me hold your knife.

49:06.292 --> 49:09.133
Look after it. And you stay on this spot.

49:35.459 --> 49:36.830
Is there a problem?

49:37.876 --> 49:40.207
- No.
- Good.

49:41.042 --> 49:42.673
Now clear off.

49:55.417 --> 49:57.828
Right. That's four of those.

49:57.917 --> 50:00.248
That will be two and six...

50:00.334 --> 50:02.545
Let's get some emergency tins of pemmican.

50:02.626 --> 50:04.667
Don't forget the grog.

50:04.751 --> 50:09.042
Not from the bottom. Don't you know
anything about the laws of gravity?

50:09.126 --> 50:11.417
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

50:45.751 --> 50:47.792
Twopence for the toffee apple.

50:49.417 --> 50:51.458
Who's favourite this year?

50:51.542 --> 50:53.462
Pickles and chutneys.

50:53.542 --> 50:55.503
Home-made cakes.

50:55.584 --> 50:57.585
Pickles and chutneys.

52:14.126 --> 52:18.077
He's got a gun! I want to go home!

52:18.167 --> 52:20.378
Roger, you're supposed
to be watching Swallow!

52:20.459 --> 52:23.790
- But there was a man and he had a...
- Swallow better be there.

52:23.876 --> 52:26.167
Wait. I forgot the ship's log.

52:27.959 --> 52:29.629
What can I do for you, Mr Turner?

52:29.709 --> 52:31.580
I'd like to send a telegram, please.

52:33.001 --> 52:34.502
- There you are.
- Thank you.

52:34.584 --> 52:38.835
I have some post for you. I'll just
have a look, see if I can find it.

52:41.917 --> 52:42.958
Not that.

52:43.959 --> 52:46.080
Oh, yes, that's for you.

52:51.876 --> 52:54.247
Oh, back from your travels, Mr Turner?

52:54.334 --> 52:58.675
Leningrad, wasn't it?
That's in Russia, isn't it?

52:59.626 --> 53:01.957
Is that because that's where
Lenin came from?

53:03.542 --> 53:09.003
You go there a lot. Anyone would think...
you had a woman there.

53:09.084 --> 53:11.085
Well, that's for me to know

53:11.167 --> 53:13.998
and for you... to find out.

53:20.917 --> 53:25.958
Dearest M, I've seen the light.
We must look to the skies.

53:26.042 --> 53:30.003
I'll be with you very soon. Yours S.76.

53:33.126 --> 53:34.917
Oh, no!

53:36.376 --> 53:39.627
Oh, dear, all the keys have come off.

53:47.042 --> 53:48.212
I forgot this.

53:48.292 --> 53:50.213
Go on, scram, you cheeky monkey.

53:54.792 --> 53:56.583
What's the point?

53:57.667 --> 54:01.288
I've just seen Captain Flint
send a life or death telegram.

54:01.376 --> 54:03.917
But the other pirate stole it.

54:04.001 --> 54:06.422
We believe you, thousands wouldn't.

54:23.667 --> 54:25.248
You must be doing it wrong.

54:26.126 --> 54:27.877
You weren't there. How would you know?

54:27.959 --> 54:29.629
Let's just use the matches.

54:29.709 --> 54:32.460
No, we're explorers.
This is how we make fire.

54:46.959 --> 54:48.580
Now we can eat!

55:05.792 --> 55:07.921
Are you sure that's fish?

55:08.001 --> 55:12.082
Nope. Looks remarkably like Vicky's sick.

55:12.167 --> 55:14.078
That's not how you cook fish.

55:14.167 --> 55:17.578
- You do it, then.
- I can't eat that, I'm a vegetarian.

55:17.667 --> 55:19.208
Well, I'm not eating it.

55:22.584 --> 55:23.925
Let's have the pemmican.

55:26.251 --> 55:29.042
Giddy-up, giddy-up. Giddy-up, horsey.

55:29.126 --> 55:30.327
Yummy.

55:30.417 --> 55:31.788
- Faster.
- That's good.

55:31.876 --> 55:33.787
Halt!

55:38.209 --> 55:40.129
Run!

55:46.584 --> 55:48.835
Down here, quick!

55:53.417 --> 55:55.748
This way, Roger.

56:02.976 --> 56:04.877
We'll have to jump.

56:04.959 --> 56:07.750
Roger, hide.
We'll come back for you when they're gone.

56:09.167 --> 56:10.378
Jump!

56:24.042 --> 56:26.213
You won't get away that easy.

56:27.876 --> 56:29.247
Weren't there four of them?

56:29.334 --> 56:31.671
Maybe. But they were going too fast.

56:31.751 --> 56:33.379
There were, because I counted them.

56:33.459 --> 56:35.630
Well, I couldn't see past my mask.

56:37.376 --> 56:39.827
Hang on, where's the short one?

56:51.876 --> 56:54.037
Swallow's been taken.

56:55.251 --> 56:56.922
Lost something, Captain?

56:58.709 --> 57:00.379
Who are you?

57:00.459 --> 57:05.920
I'm Nancy Blackett. Part owner
of the Amazon, Terror of the Seas.

57:06.001 --> 57:08.042
I'm Peggy. I own the other half.

57:08.126 --> 57:13.127
Her name's Ruth, really. But she doesn't
think it's much of a pirate's name.

57:13.209 --> 57:15.710
Shut up, Peggy. Or you'll walk the plank.

57:17.334 --> 57:19.795
- Give us back our island.
- Give us back our boat.

57:19.876 --> 57:21.037
And our brother.

57:21.126 --> 57:23.827
This is Wild Cat Island.

57:26.209 --> 57:29.250
And you... scurvy dogs...

57:30.292 --> 57:32.133
are trespassing.

57:32.751 --> 57:34.542
Tell them, Peggy.

57:34.626 --> 57:36.787
You've got ten minutes
to pack up and clear off.

57:36.876 --> 57:38.707
Or what?

57:38.792 --> 57:42.129
It's not even called Wild Cat Island.
So it can't be yours.

57:42.209 --> 57:44.750
- What's it called, then?
- Walker Island.

57:45.626 --> 57:47.747
How original.

57:48.251 --> 57:52.002
Parley. Secret Harbour. Now.

57:54.042 --> 57:57.043
- Are you a pirate?
- Just shut up and move.

57:57.709 --> 58:00.630
- Do you have any treasure?
- Are you all there?

58:01.334 --> 58:03.795
Do you have a mum?

58:04.126 --> 58:07.127
Voilà. Secret Harbour.

58:07.709 --> 58:11.790
Look at those rocks.
How did you get in there?

58:11.876 --> 58:13.667
We would have found it eventually.

58:13.751 --> 58:16.462
- It's actually really easy. You...
- Shut up, Peggy.

58:16.542 --> 58:18.383
Come on, you lot.

58:23.292 --> 58:29.043
It's our island. We discovered it.
And we'll fight to the death to keep it.

58:29.126 --> 58:34.287
We live on it now. That makes it ours.
And we'll fight to the death to defend it.

58:34.376 --> 58:36.497
What with? I see no weapons.

58:36.584 --> 58:38.335
We're not frightened of you.

58:38.417 --> 58:40.538
Or the pirate who sent you.

58:40.626 --> 58:42.877
What pirate? No-one sent us.

58:42.959 --> 58:47.710
Captain Flint. The most notorious pirate
in the whole of Houseboat Bay.

58:47.792 --> 58:51.083
- She means Uncle Jim.
- Shut up, you donkey.

58:51.167 --> 58:54.328
Watch who you're talking to,
Ruth Blackett,

58:54.417 --> 58:56.208
or I'll never sail with you again.

58:56.292 --> 58:59.421
There's only one way to settle this.
On water.

58:59.501 --> 59:03.671
The captain who takes the enemy ship
wins the island.

59:03.751 --> 59:05.379
And both ships.

59:05.459 --> 59:07.460
We can't. Swallow's not ours.

59:07.542 --> 59:10.003
- Then we win.
- No.

59:10.084 --> 59:11.715
We agree.

59:16.084 --> 59:19.295
One question: how did you get the boats
into Secret Harbour?

59:19.376 --> 59:21.917
That's for us to know and you to find out.

59:22.001 --> 59:24.542
- The harbour's marked.
- Peggy!

59:24.626 --> 59:28.167
That's all I'm going to say.
They'll never work it out.

59:28.251 --> 59:30.332
War starts tomorrow!

59:30.417 --> 59:33.828
Hang on, we don't know where you keep
Amazon. You've got an advantage.

59:33.917 --> 59:37.498
Head up the Amazon River.
You can't miss us.

59:44.167 --> 59:46.748
- Just aim for the marked tree.
- One mark isn't enough.

59:46.834 --> 59:49.425
I need two to keep me
on a straight course.

59:58.167 --> 59:59.958
It's the stump.

01:00:00.042 --> 01:00:02.673
You keep the stump and the tree
with the cross lined up.

01:00:05.417 --> 01:00:07.168
Well done, Captain.

01:00:12.626 --> 01:00:14.787
It looks like cat food.

01:00:16.251 --> 01:00:19.332
- Careful.
- I am.

01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:24.462
Hey!

01:00:24.542 --> 01:00:26.083
That's how we beat them.

01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:28.998
Leading lights. Father told me about them.

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:31.335
We hang lanterns on the marked tree
and the stump

01:00:31.417 --> 01:00:35.038
so we can get back to the harbour in the
dark. We'll capture Amazon before sunset.

01:00:35.126 --> 01:00:37.747
War doesn't start tomorrow.
It starts tonight.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:40.629
Someone will have to stay
and light the lanterns.

01:00:40.709 --> 01:00:43.420
- You're not leaving me behind again.
- I'll do it.

01:00:43.501 --> 01:00:45.421
You can't. You'd be all on your own.

01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:48.292
- I want to.
- You're not allowed to use the matches.

01:00:48.376 --> 01:00:50.457
Someone's got to do it.

01:00:51.251 --> 01:00:52.879
And it can't be Roger.

01:00:52.959 --> 01:00:55.830
As Captain, I'll give you permission
to use the matches.

01:00:55.917 --> 01:00:57.958
- Just this once.
- That's settled then.

01:00:58.042 --> 01:00:59.753
Come on, let's rig the lanterns.

01:00:59.834 --> 01:01:01.795
Roger, give me my knife.

01:01:06.251 --> 01:01:07.632
Where is it?

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:13.333
It was an accident.
It fell out of my pocket on the jetty.

01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:15.378
You lost Father's knife?

01:01:18.334 --> 01:01:21.171
What an idiot! You're useless!

01:01:21.251 --> 01:01:23.832
I knew we shouldn't have brought you!
You're a duffer!

01:01:24.834 --> 01:01:26.835
I hope you drown.

01:01:35.084 --> 01:01:37.005
He's only little.

01:01:48.126 --> 01:01:49.667
It's Uncle Jim.

01:01:50.584 --> 01:01:52.635
He must want something.

01:01:54.209 --> 01:01:56.500
Evening, ladies.

01:01:56.584 --> 01:01:59.671
- Hello, Uncle Jim.
- Hello, darling.

01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:01.582
Don't you start.

01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:03.998
So, you're alive, then.

01:02:04.084 --> 01:02:07.962
Just about. But this man-eating crocodile
would have eaten me alive...

01:02:08.042 --> 01:02:11.543
if he wasn't allergic to outrageously
talented travel writers.

01:02:14.042 --> 01:02:17.003
I didn't make any for you
because I didn't know you were coming.

01:02:17.084 --> 01:02:21.129
Because you don't tell us anything.
Because we're only your family.

01:02:21.209 --> 01:02:23.000
And what a lovely family you are as well.

01:02:23.084 --> 01:02:26.212
- You being sarcastic?
- No. Not at all, my dear sister.

01:02:26.292 --> 01:02:28.879
I've got an urgent article to finish
and I need a favour.

01:02:28.959 --> 01:02:30.330
Cup of tea for Polski.

01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:32.998
- No more parrot-sitting.
- But I'm going away.

01:02:33.084 --> 01:02:35.754
- Not again?
- It's only for a couple of days.

01:02:35.834 --> 01:02:38.335
- Can I have a word, please?
- Yeah.

01:02:41.251 --> 01:02:44.882
That's what you said last time, Jim,
and were gone for three months.

01:02:45.667 --> 01:02:47.788
The girls miss you.

01:02:48.792 --> 01:02:51.671
I don't suppose that means
anything to you, though, does it?

01:02:51.751 --> 01:02:54.252
Because work always comes first.

01:02:54.334 --> 01:02:56.254
I know.

01:02:56.334 --> 01:02:59.295
- I'll make it up to them.
- Hm.

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:00.787
I promise.

01:03:00.876 --> 01:03:02.417
Shoot the blackguard.

01:03:02.501 --> 01:03:04.332
Scurvy dog.

01:03:05.084 --> 01:03:06.465
What's this?

01:03:11.459 --> 01:03:15.630
It's a black spot.
So I'm a marked man, am I? Well...

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:20.540
if anything happens to me,
look after Polski.

01:03:23.751 --> 01:03:25.542
Jim.

01:03:25.626 --> 01:03:27.747
Just... take care.

01:03:34.792 --> 01:03:39.003
Good riddance. We don't need him now.
We've got other fish to fry.

01:03:39.084 --> 01:03:42.465
- What other fish?
- The Walkers. We're at war.

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:50.379
Don't forget the leading lights.

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:53.830
Light them when you hear
three owl hoots. That's our signal.

01:03:54.542 --> 01:03:56.003
We're depending on you.

01:04:00.709 --> 01:04:04.830
The brave crew set off in search
of the Amazon boathouse,

01:04:04.917 --> 01:04:07.538
their most dangerous mission yet.

01:04:08.667 --> 01:04:12.418
Meanwhile, Able Seaman Tatty Walker,

01:04:12.501 --> 01:04:13.921
aged nine-and-a-half,

01:04:14.001 --> 01:04:17.671
was alone on her island
like Robinson Crusoe,

01:04:17.751 --> 01:04:21.171
but without Man Friday for company.

01:04:26.459 --> 01:04:29.670
Roger, keep your eyes peeled
for the Amazon boathouse.

01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:32.248
But don't shout out.

01:04:54.001 --> 01:04:57.042
The Jolly Roger. That's their sign.

01:05:01.292 --> 01:05:02.673
Now we take Amazon.

01:05:12.167 --> 01:05:14.628
- Who's that?
- It must be them.

01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:23.540
Go on, Roger.

01:05:28.084 --> 01:05:32.545
They're dummies, you dummy.
And the boat's not Amazon.

01:05:33.126 --> 01:05:35.207
That's an old pirate trick.

01:05:36.542 --> 01:05:38.543
Well done, Captain.

01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:52.422
Roger, stop messing around.

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:56.545
- Duffer.
- Don't call him that.

01:05:56.626 --> 01:05:59.877
We're in this mess because
you didn't want to get beaten by a girl.

01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:02.210
If anyone's a duffer, it's you.

01:06:06.334 --> 01:06:07.675
Roger!

01:06:08.876 --> 01:06:10.877
- Roger!
- Roger!

01:06:12.751 --> 01:06:14.672
Roger!

01:06:17.834 --> 01:06:19.795
Roger!

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:22.037
- Roger!
- Roger!

01:06:24.292 --> 01:06:26.083
- Roger!
- Roger!

01:06:26.584 --> 01:06:29.425
- Roger! Roger!
- Roger!

01:06:33.667 --> 01:06:35.038
- Roger!
- Roger!

01:06:37.876 --> 01:06:39.827
We'll get you, Roger!

01:06:42.126 --> 01:06:45.787
- The wind's getting up.
- Help!

01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:48.497
We're coming, Roger! We'll get you!

01:06:48.584 --> 01:06:50.421
Susan!

01:06:50.501 --> 01:06:52.582
Careful. Careful.

01:06:55.834 --> 01:06:57.385
Not too close or you'll hit him!

01:06:58.792 --> 01:07:00.673
Nearly there.

01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:24.635
No duffers on your ship.

01:08:03.584 --> 01:08:08.175
- I'm doing all the hard work here.
- Nice of them to leave the lights on.

01:08:11.917 --> 01:08:16.667
Well, you were right about them
sailing tonight, weren't you?

01:08:16.751 --> 01:08:20.421
- Very impressive, don't you think?
- If you say so.

01:08:20.501 --> 01:08:24.082
- I do say so.
- It's not very nice to boast.

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:26.627
I'm not boasting,
I'm just pointing out a fact.

01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:28.460
If you say so.

01:08:31.667 --> 01:08:34.078
So we collapse their tents,
then run back here.

01:08:34.167 --> 01:08:36.207
You don't have to keep telling me.

01:08:36.292 --> 01:08:39.129
And when they come back,
we take Swallow and win.

01:08:39.209 --> 01:08:42.790
I'm starving. Can I have a toffee?

01:08:44.459 --> 01:08:47.500
- What was that?
- Me, you donkey.

01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:51.540
- Come on, slowcoach.
- I'm coming, bossy-boots.

01:08:54.459 --> 01:08:56.670
Come back, you blackguard!

01:08:58.209 --> 01:09:00.210
Bring the boat back!

01:09:00.834 --> 01:09:02.795
Scurvy dog!

01:09:02.876 --> 01:09:05.667
Son of a sea snake!

01:09:05.751 --> 01:09:07.671
You'll walk the plank!

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:11.627
I give up.

01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:15.000
So what are we gonna do now, clever clogs?

01:09:32.917 --> 01:09:34.328
You little brat.

01:09:34.417 --> 01:09:39.417
Calling Harbour Master 4-5-1.
Come in, please. It's Jim Turner.

01:09:41.167 --> 01:09:42.578
Hello, Mr Turner.

01:09:42.667 --> 01:09:45.457
- How are things with you? Over.
- I've been burgled.

01:09:45.542 --> 01:09:49.332
I'm sorry to hear that.
What's been stolen? Over.

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:51.877
A trunk with all my work in it.

01:09:51.959 --> 01:09:54.670
Well, why would anybody
want to steal that? Over.

01:09:54.751 --> 01:09:59.462
Get here as quick as you can.
On the way, can you arrest John Walker?

01:09:59.542 --> 01:10:03.503
He's staying up at Holly Howe.
Can you tell him I've got his knife?

01:10:03.584 --> 01:10:06.962
I'm sorry, I won't be going anywhere
until first thing tomorrow.

01:10:07.042 --> 01:10:10.003
There's a county darts match
at the Black Bull and I'm the captain.

01:10:10.084 --> 01:10:11.545
Over and out.

01:10:37.584 --> 01:10:39.295
Drop the knife.

01:10:43.917 --> 01:10:45.378
Drop it.

01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:55.502
Fascinating country.

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:58.085
You seem particularly fascinated
by our shipyards.

01:10:58.167 --> 01:10:59.538
Yeah, I love boats.

01:10:59.626 --> 01:11:02.247
I trust you were impressed
by the rocket plans you stole?

01:11:02.334 --> 01:11:04.545
No, I'm not impressed. No, I'm horrified.

01:11:04.626 --> 01:11:06.577
You'd do anything to defend
your own country?

01:11:06.667 --> 01:11:11.078
No, I would stop short at developing
weapons that could wipe out entire cities.

01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:17.958
Well, sadly, you and I are not in control
of what our governments do.

01:11:18.042 --> 01:11:19.923
Both governments.

01:11:20.751 --> 01:11:24.082
We intercepted the telegram
to your superior, by the way.

01:11:24.167 --> 01:11:25.918
S.76.

01:11:29.959 --> 01:11:31.750
You seem like a man of principle.

01:11:31.834 --> 01:11:35.921
We Russians, we share that.
Perhaps there's a way to work together.

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:38.332
Are you trying to poach me?

01:11:38.959 --> 01:11:41.330
- Poach you?
- Recruit. Are you trying to recruit me?

01:11:41.417 --> 01:11:43.248
Is that so ridiculous?

01:11:43.334 --> 01:11:47.879
I may have a reputation as being
something of an irritant here at home,

01:11:47.959 --> 01:11:51.580
but betrayal...
is not on the cards, I'm afraid.

01:11:51.667 --> 01:11:53.378
Pity.

01:11:54.917 --> 01:11:57.828
All right, well, time to go.

01:11:57.917 --> 01:11:59.628
All right. Have a good trip.

01:11:59.709 --> 01:12:02.330
No, no, no. You're coming with us.

01:12:03.501 --> 01:12:07.042
We need to find out exactly
how much you know.

01:12:07.126 --> 01:12:11.827
So... we can either do this
the easy way or...

01:12:14.417 --> 01:12:15.628
the hard way.

01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:17.580
It's entirely up to you.

01:12:56.626 --> 01:12:58.287
Pirates!

01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:07.130
They've killed Captain Flint
and stolen his treasure!

01:13:22.292 --> 01:13:23.833
Boat ahead!

01:13:27.334 --> 01:13:29.505
Isn't that Amazon?

01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:34.130
Careful, it might be another trick.

01:13:47.751 --> 01:13:48.921
Tatty?

01:13:49.001 --> 01:13:51.629
There was an owl and I thought
it was you, but it wasn't.

01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:55.710
And I lit the lanterns and the Amazons
came into Secret Harbour

01:13:55.792 --> 01:13:57.462
and they've took the island.

01:13:57.542 --> 01:13:58.833
You've got Amazon, Tatty.

01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:03.712
You've won it for us. We've won!

01:14:03.792 --> 01:14:05.463
- We've won!
- We won!

01:14:20.542 --> 01:14:22.583
Captain Blackett, do you surrender?

01:14:23.917 --> 01:14:26.708
We do, Captain Walker.

01:14:27.917 --> 01:14:29.918
No trickery?

01:14:30.001 --> 01:14:32.922
- No trickery.
- It's Walker Island now.

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:36.460
It will always be Wild Cat Island.

01:14:36.542 --> 01:14:39.833
In honour of the Amazon,
the Terror of the Seas.

01:14:39.917 --> 01:14:41.628
It's a better name.

01:15:01.292 --> 01:15:04.793
- Did you bake this?
- No, Mrs Jackson did.

01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:07.787
I can't bake. It's a well-known fact.

01:15:17.667 --> 01:15:19.208
Come on, Roger.

01:15:39.792 --> 01:15:43.753
Get up, all of you. Right now!

01:15:44.376 --> 01:15:47.207
Come on. Hurry up.

01:15:50.917 --> 01:15:52.958
Theft is a very serious crime, lad.

01:15:53.042 --> 01:15:56.333
Mr Turner was very angry last night
when he reported it.

01:15:56.417 --> 01:15:59.208
Own up, it will stand in your favour.

01:15:59.292 --> 01:16:02.173
- I didn't do anything.
- Were you out on the lake last night?

01:16:05.542 --> 01:16:09.462
Why did you do that?
You're not allowed to sail at night.

01:16:09.542 --> 01:16:10.833
Is this your knife?

01:16:13.251 --> 01:16:16.171
- I lost it in Rio yesterday.
- Well, that's strange.

01:16:16.251 --> 01:16:18.752
Because it was found
on Mr Turner's boat this morning.

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:22.333
And now, even stranger,
we can't find Mr Turner.

01:16:22.417 --> 01:16:23.958
Well, that's not strange.

01:16:24.042 --> 01:16:26.043
I don't know how it got there.

01:16:26.126 --> 01:16:29.747
Stop it, John. What's come over you?

01:16:29.834 --> 01:16:34.545
You were supposed to look after
the others, not get them into trouble.

01:16:34.626 --> 01:16:36.707
You told me I could trust you.

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:40.213
Don't be angry with him.
He saved my life when I fell in the lake.

01:16:44.542 --> 01:16:49.503
Don't say any more, any of you.
You're making it worse.

01:16:49.584 --> 01:16:53.629
Mrs Blackett, John will return
your brother's property immediately.

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:56.580
And he will not be allowed
to sail again this summer.

01:17:38.542 --> 01:17:40.543
Where do you think Uncle Jim is?

01:17:40.626 --> 01:17:42.707
He's gone away. As usual.

01:17:43.876 --> 01:17:48.037
If it wasn't John who stole his chest,
who did?

01:17:48.126 --> 01:17:49.957
I don't know and I don't care.

01:17:50.042 --> 01:17:51.383
Yes, you do.

01:18:12.876 --> 01:18:14.747
We have to find out who did it.

01:18:14.834 --> 01:18:19.085
It was the pirates. I saw them dump
Captain Flint in their boat.

01:18:19.167 --> 01:18:21.828
Flint isn't a pirate. He's a spy.

01:18:21.917 --> 01:18:23.708
How do you know?

01:18:23.792 --> 01:18:26.462
I saw inside his boat when I went
to give him the message.

01:18:26.542 --> 01:18:29.462
There were secret papers everywhere in...
I think it was Russian.

01:18:29.542 --> 01:18:31.333
And he had a gun.

01:18:31.417 --> 01:18:34.128
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because he threatened me.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:37.210
I saw a gun first.
The pirate in Rio had one.

01:18:37.292 --> 01:18:38.962
Shut up, Roger.

01:18:39.042 --> 01:18:40.833
But I saw the pirate in Rio.

01:18:40.917 --> 01:18:44.498
The one with the funny hat was the man
on our train, and he had a gun.

01:18:44.584 --> 01:18:46.712
Which man from the train?

01:18:46.792 --> 01:18:51.921
Who came to our carriage when Captain
Flint was pretending to be our father.

01:18:52.001 --> 01:18:55.462
- He was in Rio?
- I said 100 million times.

01:18:55.542 --> 01:18:59.543
There was another pirate, too,
and he followed Captain Flint.

01:19:00.334 --> 01:19:03.462
They were after Flint on the train.
They must have followed him here.

01:19:03.542 --> 01:19:06.003
That's why the charcoal burners
wanted us to warn him.

01:19:06.084 --> 01:19:09.671
That boat you saw them dump him in,
Tatty. Was it a motorboat?

01:19:09.751 --> 01:19:11.129
Mm-hm.

01:19:11.209 --> 01:19:15.040
They're on our island. I saw their boat
on the shore when we were leaving.

01:19:16.459 --> 01:19:18.580
They've got Flint.

01:19:18.667 --> 01:19:20.788
I think they're going to kill him.

01:19:21.751 --> 01:19:24.792
You two stay here. Susan,
bring the torch and meet me downstairs.

01:19:24.876 --> 01:19:26.917
- Why, where are you going?
- We can save him.

01:19:27.001 --> 01:19:29.132
We have to tell the Amazons.
We sail at dawn.

01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:58.328
Please let me come with you.

01:20:48.417 --> 01:20:50.208
Our lift has arrived.

01:20:52.042 --> 01:20:55.753
I don't fly. You can't trust these
newfangled contraptions.

01:20:55.834 --> 01:20:59.335
- The sky's the future.
- Well, then, I'll stay a dinosaur.

01:20:59.751 --> 01:21:01.212
Let him go.

01:21:05.834 --> 01:21:08.175
- Let him go!
- John.

01:21:08.876 --> 01:21:10.577
All right.

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:13.835
Put it down, John.

01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:15.960
Come on.

01:21:19.251 --> 01:21:21.832
Your last chance. I mean it.

01:21:24.167 --> 01:21:25.578
You're brave.

01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:30.000
But you're gonna have to pull the
trigger if you want me to do that.

01:21:30.834 --> 01:21:32.585
So are you brave enough?

01:21:34.834 --> 01:21:36.885
Pulling that trigger isn't brave.

01:21:38.792 --> 01:21:42.213
Not pulling it, that's much braver.

01:21:43.542 --> 01:21:45.133
John, look at me.

01:21:46.042 --> 01:21:47.543
Look at me.

01:21:48.959 --> 01:21:50.790
You've done more than enough.

01:21:52.792 --> 01:21:53.963
Now come on.

01:21:55.959 --> 01:21:57.420
Come on, son.

01:21:59.376 --> 01:22:02.037
Put it down. It's all right.

01:22:08.917 --> 01:22:10.458
Good lad.

01:22:20.292 --> 01:22:24.583
Nancy, take Pegs home.
I'll be back before you know it.

01:22:25.334 --> 01:22:27.175
Now go on.

01:22:28.876 --> 01:22:30.827
Look after everyone.

01:22:30.917 --> 01:22:32.998
Now go on. Go!

01:22:39.792 --> 01:22:42.003
Come on! We can still stop them.

01:22:42.501 --> 01:22:44.132
Get to the boats!

01:22:55.667 --> 01:22:58.288
Don't worry, they'll soon be out
of our way. Come on.

01:23:27.792 --> 01:23:29.463
It's those children again!

01:23:35.917 --> 01:23:37.748
They're up to something!

01:23:37.834 --> 01:23:39.835
Never mind them. Get a move on, please.

01:23:45.459 --> 01:23:47.330
What's happening? Why aren't we moving?

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.582
Yes!

01:24:01.667 --> 01:24:03.328
We've done it.

01:24:03.417 --> 01:24:05.498
Well, boost the engine!

01:24:29.417 --> 01:24:31.168
Untie it!

01:24:56.626 --> 01:24:59.997
- Susan! Take the tiller.
- Go!

01:25:00.084 --> 01:25:02.335
We're gonna drown!

01:25:02.417 --> 01:25:05.078
Be careful! Come on, John!

01:25:16.792 --> 01:25:19.173
- Come on!
- Quickly!

01:25:52.542 --> 01:25:54.043
We failed.

01:25:55.084 --> 01:25:57.085
At least we tried.

01:26:21.751 --> 01:26:24.212
- It's going to crash!
- Oh, no!

01:26:53.042 --> 01:26:56.963
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

01:27:11.917 --> 01:27:13.748
It's Captain Flint!

01:27:24.917 --> 01:27:26.498
Woo-hoo!

01:27:45.209 --> 01:27:49.830
It's all right, Peg. It'll take more
than that to get rid of me.

01:27:52.209 --> 01:27:54.290
And I owe you, Captain Blackett.

01:27:55.792 --> 01:27:57.383
Come here.

01:27:58.042 --> 01:27:59.673
That's it.

01:28:01.001 --> 01:28:05.042
Now, I'm not a man...
well-known for my humility...

01:28:06.959 --> 01:28:09.670
but it seems
I seriously misjudged your son.

01:28:11.751 --> 01:28:13.712
You're not the only one.

01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:19.378
I own up, John.

01:28:19.459 --> 01:28:22.710
I was wrong and I'm so sorry.

01:28:35.501 --> 01:28:38.462
That was the bravest thing I've ever seen.

01:28:40.626 --> 01:28:42.957
Not as brave as when you fell in the lake.

01:28:54.792 --> 01:28:56.753
Keep it for a bit.

01:28:58.084 --> 01:28:59.675
Really?

01:29:06.251 --> 01:29:09.002
And so ended our great adventure.

01:29:09.084 --> 01:29:14.212
The victors were invited to a party
on Captain Flint's boat.

01:29:14.292 --> 01:29:16.833
He was off on a top secret mission,

01:29:16.917 --> 01:29:21.628
and he asked me to look after Polski
because he's used to writers.

01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:23.670
They turned me into a parrot.

01:29:23.751 --> 01:29:26.129
But there was still one question
to answer.

01:29:26.209 --> 01:29:27.790
Are you really a spy?

01:29:27.876 --> 01:29:30.667
Yes, are you really?

01:29:30.751 --> 01:29:32.379
No...

01:29:32.459 --> 01:29:34.080
I'm really a pirate.

01:29:36.251 --> 01:29:38.712
Walk the plank. Walk the plank.

01:29:38.792 --> 01:29:42.043
Walk the plank! Walk the plank!

01:29:54.667 --> 01:29:56.918
I think this is yours, Captain.

01:30:03.626 --> 01:30:07.247
I'll be back... you blackguards.

01:30:21.126 --> 01:30:23.077
Come on, then, join me!

01:30:24.209 --> 01:30:26.170
Wheeeee!

01:30:27.001 --> 01:30:30.002
Swallows and Amazons for ever.
