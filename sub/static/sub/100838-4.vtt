00:21.396 --> 00:24.190
[man]<i> It's time. Time for you to get up.</i>

00:24.607 --> 00:27.861
<i>Look in the mirror</i>
<i>and decide who you wanna be today.</i>

00:28.611 --> 00:30.947

00:31.239 --> 00:33.616
<i>And in order to succeed hard,</i>

00:33.908 --> 00:35.076
[Judy] What is that?

00:35.493 --> 00:38.705
That's my podcast alarm.
<i>The Winners' Strategy.</i>

00:38.788 --> 00:40.915
-[alarm] <i>...strategy for...</i>
-Gets me pumped for the day.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.126
Oh! Are you doing self-help?

00:43.334 --> 00:44.169
No.

00:45.503 --> 00:46.463
I don't think so.

00:47.630 --> 00:48.465
Look at you.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.592
Yeah. But it's not
like your weird mystical shit.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.677
This is about tools for maximum success.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.889
It'd be great for you, actually.
It's discipline, it's planning,

00:56.389 --> 00:58.058
grabbing the life you want now.

00:59.768 --> 01:00.769
What are you doing?

01:00.852 --> 01:02.729
Shh! I'm grabbing what I want now.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.944
[moans softly] I missed you.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.118
But I can't be late for work.

01:18.536 --> 01:21.790
Plus, I got to hop on the trampoline
to get my lymph nodes going.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.249
Can you give me a ride?

01:23.333 --> 01:25.502
I gave you a few last night, didn't I?

01:25.585 --> 01:27.087
I mean to Jen's.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.964
Baby...

01:30.965 --> 01:32.550
when are you gonna start driving again?

01:37.263 --> 01:38.473
-[screams]
-[tires screech]

01:39.432 --> 01:40.266
Oh, my God!

01:41.768 --> 01:43.269
I'm never driving again.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.230
It's too triggering.

01:45.563 --> 01:48.066
Baby, how are you supposed
to move past all of this

01:48.817 --> 01:51.194
when you're still living with his wife?

01:51.694 --> 01:53.988
-I don't know how you sleep over there.
-I don't.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.367
I did last night, though.

01:58.034 --> 02:01.496
Oh, I missed this California King.

02:01.788 --> 02:02.872
Missed you in it.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.791
Seriously, though. I'm worried about you.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.751
Being around them
is not good for your head.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.671
It's not bad for my head.

02:10.338 --> 02:12.215
Jen and I are becoming
really close friends.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.341
Judy.

02:14.092 --> 02:14.926
What?

02:15.176 --> 02:16.970
What kind of friendship is based on lies?

02:17.637 --> 02:18.930
And manslaughter?

02:19.889 --> 02:21.015
A layered one?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.601
She doesn't even know who you really are.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.729
You know what? I'm helping her.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.481
You wanna help her?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.443
Move out, let her move on.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.781
I can't just not be friends with her
anymore. She relies on me.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.826
What, just walk out on her?
I wouldn't even know how to do that.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.495
It's not that hard.
Just pick a fight with her. Push her away.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.165
That's your MO, not mine.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.167
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

02:47.292 --> 02:48.877
You know I'm vehemently anti-conflict.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.838
And if I move out,
where am I supposed to go?

02:53.214 --> 02:54.257
I don't know.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.800
How about...

02:56.426 --> 02:58.011
back to this California King?

02:58.094 --> 02:59.596
[laughing]

03:01.764 --> 03:03.141
I know you still love me.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.769
-Don't do that.
-Come on.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.313
Don't.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.734
You got to admit,
last night felt good, right?

03:16.237 --> 03:17.614
Like how it used to feel.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.200
It did.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.077
And you missed me.

03:25.788 --> 03:26.706
I did.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.294
Maybe we could go back
to the way it was...

03:32.295 --> 03:33.671
before everything happened.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.549
That's such a nice dream.

03:37.884 --> 03:38.885
Or not.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.347
Come home.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.688
Wait. I thought you were
selling the house.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.983
Well, sometimes your strategy changes.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.241
[Judy laughing]

04:01.699 --> 04:05.912
Oh, God, you <i>are </i>the California King!

04:21.135 --> 04:22.470
-Oh, hey, Judy.
-Hey.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.265
You must really like that dress.
You wore it yesterday.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.516
Uh...

04:26.891 --> 04:28.351
Yeah, it's my very favorite dress.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.520
-Nice.
-Where's your mom?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.480
She's in her room.
She hasn't come down yet.

04:32.730 --> 04:36.109
Yeah. I don't wanna shock you,
but she's pissed about something.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.698
-[screen] <i>All right, now, push...</i>
-[panting]

04:41.906 --> 04:44.242
<i>...down the road. Everything you want.</i>

04:44.742 --> 04:46.369
<i>-Everything you deserve!</i>
-[knocking]

04:47.412 --> 04:48.621
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:48.871 --> 04:51.666
-Hey! Hey.
-Are you okay?

04:52.000 --> 04:52.959
Are <i>you </i>okay?

04:53.209 --> 04:54.043
Yeah.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.838
I can't believe you went to jail for me.
Why did you do that?

04:57.338 --> 04:59.090
That's what friends are for, right?

05:00.174 --> 05:01.009
No.

05:01.592 --> 05:02.468
It was fine.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.721
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:05.013 --> 05:08.099
I'm so sorry. Steve didn't have
to bail you out. I would've done that.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.060
So, what happened?
Did you have to spend the night there?

05:11.144 --> 05:14.230
Uh, no. I spent the night with Steve.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.150
Okay.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.276
-We fucked.
-Judy...

05:18.359 --> 05:19.360
Like, a bunch of times.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.903
-Judy!
-I know.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.323
I have a weakness for him.
It's like an addiction.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.534
But it was very transformative.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.579
And there is something
that I have to tell you.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.788
Ted was fucking someone.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.749
-What?
-Ted was fucking someone.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.666
Our Ted?

05:33.750 --> 05:35.335
Yeah. Our Ted.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.712
[breathing hard]

05:38.421 --> 05:40.298
[heavy breathing]

05:43.384 --> 05:45.345
I was up all night
trying to figure out who she is.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.763
How many Bambis do you know?

05:46.971 --> 05:48.681
-Judy, it's a screen name.
-Right.

05:48.806 --> 05:52.018
I hope it's not someone I know,
you know, like our chiropractor.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.227
That would be a loss.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.563
-It's so hard to find a good one.
-Or a mom at school.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.900
Oh, God, I would kill myself
if it's Turid Kristansson.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.694
Wait. Her name's Turid?

06:01.778 --> 06:05.073
She's this Norwegian former supermodel
who takes pictures of herself

06:05.156 --> 06:07.200
bathing with her kids
and posts them on Instagram.

06:07.283 --> 06:11.871
Well, I don't think Bambi is Turid
unless Turid is also a waitress.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.457
I'm chatting with her right now
on the game.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.458
-[beeping]
-You are?

06:15.541 --> 06:16.584
Yeah, she thinks I'm Ted.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.836
-Huh?
-Don't. Don't look.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.422
She got a filthy mouth and she can...
Wow! Really paint a picture.

06:21.672 --> 06:24.008
Talking about his cock?
'Cause evidently she misses it.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.635
She is and she does.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.554
Oh, God. A waitress.
Jesus. That's disgusting.

06:28.763 --> 06:29.806
Hey, I was a waitress.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.100
-So was I, but I need to hate the bitch.
-Okay.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.936
I get that you're upset,
but don't be a woman who blames the woman.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.896
Well, who am I supposed to blame?
The man is dead.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.899
-[beep]
-Plus, he was married, so she's gross.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.485
She got a new job
at some restaurant in Dana Point.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.987
She thinks that Ted is meeting her
at the end of her shift.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.615
-Oh, we are so going there.
-We so are.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.450
But to do what, exactly?

06:49.659 --> 06:53.121
Well, what I wanna do is punch her
'cause she is a slutty little homewrecker.

06:53.204 --> 06:57.166
Okay. You wanna do that, but if I were
you, I would think of maybe, like,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.919
a less violent strategy.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.089
Fine. Then I wanna know
how the fuck this happened,

07:03.172 --> 07:05.299
when the fuck, why the fuck,
and what the fucking fuck,

07:05.383 --> 07:08.219
-and then tell her that he's dead.
-Okay. That sounds like a plan.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.929
And if I punch her, I fucking punch her.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.353
-Which one do you think is Bambi?
-I'll know her when I see her.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.107
Oh, well, he'd like that ass.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.775
You think it's her?

07:25.403 --> 07:26.279
That's her.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.281
-That's fucking her.
-Her?

07:28.573 --> 07:29.407
Yeah.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.868
-He'd like the blonde.
-Are you sure?

07:32.452 --> 07:33.578
I know my husband.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.121
Sorry. Do you need a table?

07:35.413 --> 07:36.247
Yeah.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.332
<i>♪ I'm a naughty girl ♪</i>

07:38.458 --> 07:40.418
<i>♪ I'm a nice girl too</i>
<i>I'm a naughty girl ♪</i>

07:40.793 --> 07:42.670
Oh, God.
<i>-♪ Anything for you ♪</i>

07:42.879 --> 07:48.426
<i>♪ Play with me</i>
<i>Come on, rocksteady ♪</i>

07:49.927 --> 07:53.306
Should we get the Macho Nachos
or should we get the Arab Spring Rolls?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.350
What is the theme of this restaurant?

07:57.643 --> 07:59.479
Of course she has perfect tits.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.981
-Yours are better.
-Yeah, well...

08:03.191 --> 08:04.108
mine aren't mine.

08:05.860 --> 08:06.736
What do you mean?

08:08.154 --> 08:10.656
I had the, like,
the double thing, you know?

08:11.866 --> 08:12.909
You had cancer?

08:13.075 --> 08:14.243
No. No, I...

08:15.036 --> 08:17.997
I have the gene,
so I just got ahead of it.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.958
I didn't want my kids
to lose their mom like I did.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.336
Oh, my God. I didn't realize.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.588
How old were you when your mom died?

08:26.214 --> 08:27.131
Nineteen.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.300
So, older than Bambi.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.512
I'm so sorry.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.055
About which part?

08:34.805 --> 08:35.640
All of it.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.602
Have you figured out
what you're gonna say to her?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.646
I just wanna know how many times.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.233
It couldn't be that many times, right?
To fly under the radar like that?

08:45.650 --> 08:49.195
I guess. But you gotta know a cock
pretty well to miss it.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.738
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.533
Welcome to Bliss Pointe. Can I get
you girls started with some apps?

08:54.492 --> 08:57.411
Is your calamari fresh
or is it made from pig assholes?

08:58.955 --> 08:59.830
It's squid.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.750
I just heard some places use pig assholes.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.378
-How is the Guacadilla?
-Oh, amaze.

09:06.003 --> 09:06.921
We'll try that.

09:07.004 --> 09:10.383
Yeah. No, you know,
I'll just have another Frojito.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.677
Um, people really love
the Jerk Chicken Kabob.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.179
What is the cuisine in this place, Bambi?

09:15.555 --> 09:19.767
Is it Asian or Middle Eastern
or, like, Mexican?

09:19.850 --> 09:21.435
Yeah, like, everything, I think.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.605
Um, the owner is, like,
a globalist, I think.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.400
Or he just likes to appropriate
other people's shit.

09:27.650 --> 09:28.818
Yep. She'll have the Kabob.

09:30.069 --> 09:30.903
Okay.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.697
Thanks so much.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.157
Obviously, whatever they had
was just physical,

09:35.324 --> 09:37.827
because could you imagine
having to converse with that?

09:37.910 --> 09:41.747
Okay. Look, if you wanna know
what happened or how many times,

09:41.831 --> 09:44.417
I think open hostility
is probs not the best way to do it.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.128
You realize that that is
the tip of my hostility iceberg?

09:47.211 --> 09:48.045
Oh, I do.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.172
But I think
that you should really befriend her,

09:50.339 --> 09:52.133
charm her, soften her up.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.678
I'm confronting her, Judy,
I'm not grooming her.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.638
You know what I mean.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.976
Ted was just never a player.

10:02.476 --> 10:05.313
I mean, even when he was touring,
he was, like, the anti-player.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.106
Maybe he wasn't.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.400
-[cell phone buzzes]
-Maybe I didn't know him.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.864
-Fuck. Fuck!
-What?

10:15.364 --> 10:17.033
Steve's pulling his house off the market.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.702
Like I need that shit right now!

10:20.161 --> 10:23.748
We had three fucking offers over asking.
One in all cash.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.917
-God, talk about players.
-Steve's not a player.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.503
He's too scared of disease,
and he's very sensitive to condoms.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.506
He told Christopher he fell back in love.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.718
Chris always oversells clients
their houses,

10:35.801 --> 10:37.762
like it's fucking <i>Love It or List It</i>
or something.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.014
But, no, it's fucking just,
"List It, Chris."

10:41.599 --> 10:43.726
I think that Steve
might have been talking about me.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.105
Did you know
that he was pulling the house?

10:50.816 --> 10:53.944
I didn't wanna upset you
and we were on another topic.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.780
Yeah.
We're on the topic of assholes, Judy.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.407
At least I didn't know
that Ted was a fucking asshole,

10:58.491 --> 10:59.950
but you have all the information.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.161
I know things weren't good at the end
with me and Steve,

11:02.244 --> 11:03.412
but you were the one who said

11:03.496 --> 11:06.457
that everything that we went through
made us crazy. And you're totally right.

11:06.957 --> 11:10.169
I mean, you didn't really know
the kind, nurturing Steve.

11:10.252 --> 11:13.214
Well, what about the Steve
that left you after five miscarriages?

11:13.756 --> 11:17.176
-That's not fair.
-No, it's really shitty. But it's true.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.387
He was hurting. I was hurting.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.806
And then he was hurting
because I was hurting.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.891
He's really been working on himself, Jen.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.602
So what? I mean...

11:28.187 --> 11:30.398
is he pulling the house because you're...

11:31.148 --> 11:32.274
you're moving back in there?

11:33.067 --> 11:36.070
I really wanted to tell you this morning,
but I didn't want...

11:37.071 --> 11:38.614
This whole thing with Bambi came up.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.991
You're not even in that house, Judy.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.910
I mean, I have been in every room.

11:42.993 --> 11:46.706
It is all Steve,
as if you've never even lived there.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.959
Well, Steve has a very specific aesthetic.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.711
What? Modern douche?

11:52.545 --> 11:55.464
He let me put a Buddha in the guest bath.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.758
You know what?
I can't live your life for you,

11:57.842 --> 12:00.428
but, fuck, would I be making
better choices than that.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.430
Well, too bad we can't
live each other's lives.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.223
It's too bad
because mine's so fucking great.

12:04.306 --> 12:06.267
[Bambi] Guacadilla and two Frosés.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.852
I wanted a Frojito, Bambi.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.146
Oh, dang. Sorry.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.356
-It's fine.
-I'll drink sewer water at this point.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.191
[Bambi] The Frosés are yummo. [giggles]

12:14.900 --> 12:15.776
Don't say "yummo."

12:16.068 --> 12:16.944
Okay.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.739
[Judy] You know,
I hope this isn't weird for you,

12:19.822 --> 12:23.993
but I just wanted to say that mango
uniform blouse looks awesome on you.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.579
The color just really brings out
the gold in your skin.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.372
OMG, you're so nice!

12:28.456 --> 12:29.832
OMG, <i>you </i>are!

12:30.416 --> 12:32.042
I honestly am really happy you said that,

12:32.126 --> 12:34.837
because I just got a romper
in this same color for gigging,

12:34.920 --> 12:37.006
and I was like, "Wait, is this too much?"

12:37.381 --> 12:40.134
-Gigging?
-Yeah, I'm a singer-songwriter.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.178
I play guitar and, like, some piano.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.055
Would we have heard any of your music?

12:45.139 --> 12:47.850
Well, I was working on an album
with my boyfriend,

12:47.933 --> 12:50.102
who's, like, crazy talented, but...

12:50.311 --> 12:52.021
-Your boyfriend?
-Well, he was.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.356
He's been kind of hot and cold lately.

12:56.525 --> 12:57.693
Hot and cold how?

12:58.486 --> 13:01.947
Um... Like, he kind of ghosted me
a couple of months ago,

13:02.031 --> 13:05.159
and then all of a sudden he was like,
"Hey, girl, I'm back.

13:05.242 --> 13:08.579
I'll see you after your shift."
And I was like, "Thanks, Ted."

13:11.957 --> 13:13.292
Ted. [clears throat]

13:13.959 --> 13:15.795
-Ted's your boyfriend?
-He was.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.630
I don't really know what he is now.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.510
How long were you dating, Bambi?

13:23.260 --> 13:24.261
Not that long.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.888
Like a year and a half.

13:25.971 --> 13:26.931
-Holy shit.
-I know!

13:27.389 --> 13:29.642
To then not talk to me for three months!

13:30.601 --> 13:31.936
He's lucky I love him.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.317
-A year and a half!
-Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.902
-I'm such a fucking fool.
-No.

13:40.152 --> 13:43.239
He was lying to my face
for a year and a half.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.951
-How did I not see that?
-[cell phone chimes]

13:48.619 --> 13:50.913
I don't know.
I think sometimes in relationships,

13:50.996 --> 13:53.874
-people see whatever they wanna see.
-Yeah. You would know.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.169
-It's not the same.
-Please.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.088
You think Steve has really changed, Judy?

13:59.171 --> 14:01.382
The asshole that just gave you
a restraining order?

14:01.465 --> 14:03.050
Okay. Our relationship is complicated.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.803
-It's not complicated, Judy. It's toxic!
-I'm not perfect either.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.680
God! Stop making excuses for him!

14:07.763 --> 14:09.974
Stop projecting! Steve is not Ted.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.560
Before everything happened,
Steve was really good to me.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.479
He was kind. He was loving.
He never cheated on me. He was...

14:17.231 --> 14:18.065
Really?

14:19.191 --> 14:22.027
-I'm sorry.
-Fuck you, Judy.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.572
-I didn't mean to say that.
-You said it! What did you mean?

14:24.655 --> 14:27.867
I don't wanna fight! Okay?
There's a lot of shit you don't know!

14:27.950 --> 14:30.828
Yeah. Well, you know what?
Apparently, I don't fucking know anybody.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.873
Jen! Come on! Where are you going?

14:35.457 --> 14:37.209
-[Judy sighs]
-Uh...

14:37.960 --> 14:39.837
Can I get you another round?

14:39.920 --> 14:41.881
No. I'm just gonna take the check. Thanks.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.883
But you haven't even
touched your Guacadilla.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.718
-Yeah. It's fine.
-Okay.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.762
Hey, is your friend okay?

14:49.138 --> 14:51.640
She seemed, like, kind of upset.

14:58.981 --> 14:59.982
Ted's dead.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.485
I'm sorry?

15:05.195 --> 15:07.031
Ted, he's dead.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.117
What... what do you mean?

15:11.285 --> 15:13.120
Ted? Like, my Ted?

15:13.871 --> 15:14.705
No.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.166
My Ted.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.210
I'm his wife.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.881
What? No. That's impossible.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.676
Impossible that he's dead
or impossible that I'm his wife?

15:28.052 --> 15:28.886
Both.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.555
He told me you died.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.028
[Jen] Hey. You okay?

15:46.111 --> 15:47.112
Hey. Yeah.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.864
You look like you saw a ghost.

15:49.990 --> 15:50.908
Thanks.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.660
I'm so sorry about what I said.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.036
It's all right.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.872
What do you need?
Do you wanna go punch her?

15:57.206 --> 15:58.040
No.

15:58.582 --> 15:59.625
I keyed her car.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.087
You did?
How did you know which one it was?

16:03.337 --> 16:04.797
I don't know. I just guessed.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.049
So, you keyed <i>someone's </i>car?

16:07.132 --> 16:10.427
Yup.
And then I bought a pack of cigarettes.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.972
I fucking love you.

16:14.264 --> 16:17.518
-[lighter clicks]
-Such a fucking joke! So basic.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.187
He just turned this marriage
into a cliche.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.648
Fuck him! Basic bitch!

16:22.731 --> 16:23.816
Totally. You know what?

16:23.899 --> 16:26.485
Maybe we should just pull over and,
you know, talk about it?

16:26.568 --> 16:27.695
No. I'm fine!

16:28.362 --> 16:29.196
[tires screech]

16:30.155 --> 16:32.157
Your driving is just a little erratic.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.867
Please, Judy.
Will you please just relax?

16:33.951 --> 16:35.953
-I just need to vent.
-Okay.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.997
-[tires screech]
-[Judy] Oh, my God!

16:38.539 --> 16:40.124
-I'm fine.
-Okay. But you're scaring me!

16:40.207 --> 16:41.750
You know what? You drive.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.003
I can light this fucking cigarette.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.131
-[car horn blares]
-[tires screech]

16:50.384 --> 16:53.178
[lighter clicking]

17:03.772 --> 17:06.817
[heartbeat]

17:15.909 --> 17:17.077
I don't even want this.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.913
Hey, I'm sorry I scared you. Okay?

17:21.165 --> 17:22.750
-You're okay.
-[engine starts]

17:22.833 --> 17:24.418
[inhales deeply] We're okay.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.471
The speed limit is 30 in Laguna.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.640
-I know.
-Yeah. But you're going, like, 11.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.225
I'm being safe.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.729
You know that driving slow
is just as dangerous as speeding?

17:44.146 --> 17:45.189
-That's not true.
-[beep]

17:45.272 --> 17:46.607
Oh, car agrees with me.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.737
Did I tell you
Laguna is his hometown, right?

17:52.404 --> 17:54.990
It's where he wanted to live,
where he felt safe.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.701
It's, like, I just had to figure it out.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.704
How am I gonna make money
and feed four mouths.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.540
But you did it. You made a beautiful life.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.085
What life? This isn't my life.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.503
This is his life.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.756
I worked to support him and his dreams.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.758
I had my own dreams.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.305
I'm really gonna need you to go faster.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.058
Your dreams, what were they?

18:22.017 --> 18:24.061
-They're stupid now.
-No!

18:24.144 --> 18:27.022
-No. It's embarrassing.
-Come on!

18:29.483 --> 18:30.651
I wanted to be a dancer.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.071
That is not stupid. That's amazing.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.031
I was really good too.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.241
I bet you were.

18:38.283 --> 18:43.497
But it just... seemed like his career
was taking off and...

18:43.580 --> 18:45.707
Not to ruin it for you, it didn't.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.544
But, you know,
I'm the one with the uterus,

18:48.627 --> 18:51.296
and I've gotta be the grown-up here,
and for what?

18:51.839 --> 18:53.799
So, he just stopped fucking me

18:53.882 --> 18:58.053
and start fucking some 20-year-old
with big, warm tits

18:58.137 --> 19:00.722
who makes him feel like a genius?
Fuck him.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.684
You guys weren't sleeping together

19:03.767 --> 19:05.686
and you didn't think that
maybe something was going on?

19:05.769 --> 19:06.728
No. I did.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.858
And I asked him about it, but he was
just so convincing with his bad back

19:10.941 --> 19:14.111
and his depressed
"I'm-Never-Gonna-Be-A-Rockstar" bullshit.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.196
-[scoffs]
-[cell phone chimes]

19:17.447 --> 19:18.574
Oh, God. It's Steve.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.993
Of course it is.
He's been texting you all night.

19:21.743 --> 19:23.287
He wants me to go over there.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.123
What do you want, Judy?

19:26.707 --> 19:27.666
Do you wanna go?

19:28.917 --> 19:30.669
Do you wanna move back in with him?

19:35.048 --> 19:37.509
I just want things to go back to before...

19:38.635 --> 19:40.137
before everything happened.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.681
What, you want it to be the way it was?

19:43.682 --> 19:46.560
[heartbeat]

19:47.019 --> 19:48.604
-[screams]
-[tires screech]

19:49.396 --> 19:50.480
Holy shit!

19:53.317 --> 19:54.902
-What are you doing?
-We have to go back.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.154
No! Don't be fucking stupid!
You can't go back!

20:00.866 --> 20:02.618
I don't want things to be
the way they were.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.537
-Good.
-I just wish things were different.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.081
-You and me both, sister.
-I wish I was different.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.043
No. No. Judy, you are great.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.878
You are fucking awesome.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.505
Your choices are a little questionable.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.924
Oh. You have no idea.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.551
You don't have to do
what he wants anymore.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.553
Too much has happened.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.680
You know, love is just not enough.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.350
You need space
so that you can be fully you...

20:27.226 --> 20:30.729
or, you know,
you're just gonna end up like me.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.110
And what would you do if you were me?

20:40.280 --> 20:41.406
[knocking]

20:47.996 --> 20:49.039
Oh, hey.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.041
Hello, Steve.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.126
Hello, Jen.

20:53.961 --> 20:54.878
What's up?

20:55.295 --> 20:56.755
You should take the cash offer.

20:56.838 --> 21:00.342
It's 200 over asking.
You would be stupid not to.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.052
[chuckles]

21:02.135 --> 21:03.428
She's always selling!

21:03.971 --> 21:08.016
Look, I get why you'd want me to do that.
I do. And I'm sorry.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.852
But I am pulling the house.
I don't wanna sell.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.440
It's just such a big house for one person.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.819
It's not just for one person.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.698
Judy is not coming back.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.743
I mean, it's not like you ever let her
live in this house to begin with.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.332
You don't have a fucking clue
what you're talking about.

21:33.917 --> 21:34.918
You barely know her.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.964
Maybe, but I get her.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.135
Take the offer.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.232
-[Jen sighs]
-What happened? What'd he say?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.442
God! He's a dick.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.902
-I know.
-But he's the worst kind of dick.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.739
He's a secret dick,
because you don't know it at first.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.866
Because he's so good-looking and charming.

22:05.949 --> 22:08.577
Yeah, but he's so good-looking, that it,
like, comes back around the other side.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.953
Oh, God. Thank you.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.289
-Hmm?
-I could not have done that myself.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.875
Well, I'm so...

22:15.625 --> 22:17.210
I don't know why I can't say no to him.

22:17.294 --> 22:20.339
Because you're an addict.
You have to put down the pipe.

22:20.422 --> 22:21.840
By the pipe, you mean his penis?

22:21.923 --> 22:23.884
Yes. I mean his penis.
Obviously, I mean his penis.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.261
-It's so hard for me to put that down.
-Is it a big penis?

22:26.928 --> 22:28.597
-It's like...
-Oh, shit. Really?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.057
It's a good version of big.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.101
-Good-looking and with a big dick?
-What do you do?

22:33.185 --> 22:34.853
-How do you find that again?
-You don't.

22:34.936 --> 22:35.771
I know.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.856
-You...
-I should go back in there?

22:37.939 --> 22:41.985
No. You are beautiful,
and you are a good person,

22:42.069 --> 22:43.528
and you have a great heart.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.239
And you would never hurt a fly.

22:48.116 --> 22:49.618
I don't think I deserve that.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.036
Oh, just take it.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.748
Oh, God. What is wrong with me?

22:54.831 --> 22:57.125
Why do I pick guys who treat me like shit?

22:57.626 --> 22:59.711
I don't know.
I just spent 18 years with a liar.

22:59.795 --> 23:02.130
What does that say about me?
That I wanna be lied to?

23:08.428 --> 23:09.888
I have to tell you something.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.640
What?

23:16.186 --> 23:17.104
He killed you.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.066
What?

23:21.900 --> 23:24.486
Ted. He told Bambi that you were dead.

23:26.696 --> 23:27.697
Breast cancer.

23:30.909 --> 23:31.785
No.

23:33.954 --> 23:37.916
He said that he was a widower and
that he was raising the kids all alone.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.294
Uh...

23:44.631 --> 23:46.800
I didn't know if I should tell you or not.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.846
I don't know if you
should've told me either.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.474
[sighs heavily] I'm sorry.

23:57.310 --> 23:58.895
I can't fucking believe him.

24:00.605 --> 24:01.648
Yeah. I know.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.193
What the fuck have I been doing here?

24:08.321 --> 24:11.199
I've spent months trying to...

24:12.701 --> 24:13.994
bring him justice,

24:14.619 --> 24:17.414
obsessed with trying to find
the person that killed him,

24:17.497 --> 24:18.457
and for what?

24:20.625 --> 24:22.043
He fucking killed me.

24:24.421 --> 24:25.255
Yeah.

24:27.883 --> 24:28.758
Yeah.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.889
He's such a fucking asshole.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.933
Right. He's the asshole.

24:47.694 --> 24:48.945
I'm glad he's dead.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.416
Put on your seat belt.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.792
[engine starts]

25:02.876 --> 25:04.002
I'm taking us home.
