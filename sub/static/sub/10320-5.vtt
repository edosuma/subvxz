01:22.851 --> 01:23.811
Yeah!

01:24.019 --> 01:25.729
Were my quacks quacky enough?

01:25.938 --> 01:29.817
Are you kidding? I could have sworn
there was a duck hiding in this room.

01:30.025 --> 01:32.110
You'll rock your school recital tonight.

01:32.319 --> 01:38.033
I know I look like I got it going on,
but deep down, I'm a wreck.

01:39.910 --> 01:43.288
Don't worry about it.
You're not gonna quack under the pressure.

01:44.581 --> 01:46.249
How could you make a joke?

01:46.333 --> 01:48.502
This is "Old MacDonald," man.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.631
It could make or break second grade.

01:55.592 --> 01:57.218
Okay, Max.

01:57.302 --> 02:00.848
I was keeping this a secret
in case you absolutely needed it.

02:00.931 --> 02:03.976
But this is my super-magic scarf.

02:05.268 --> 02:08.229
The first time I deejayed in a real club,
I was terrified,

02:08.312 --> 02:09.606
until I put this bad boy on.

02:09.815 --> 02:13.027
- Then what happened?
- I got super brave.

02:13.109 --> 02:15.946
I did a killer set
and I got a standing ovation.

02:16.030 --> 02:20.742
The crowd was already standing, but had
they been sitting, they'd have stood up.

02:20.826 --> 02:23.704
And now I bestow it upon you.

02:23.912 --> 02:26.832
Ta-da!

02:28.042 --> 02:30.878
- Are you feeling it?
- I think I am.

02:31.419 --> 02:34.006
Alright, blow that horn, cat.

02:37.885 --> 02:42.014
Wow! That was... just like before,
but braver.

02:43.390 --> 02:44.808
I know!

02:44.892 --> 02:47.268
This thing really is super-magic.

02:47.978 --> 02:51.857
But you'd better keep it safe
till I need it. Thanks, Aunt Stephanie.

02:53.233 --> 02:55.402
Anything for you, Mighty Max.

02:55.485 --> 03:01.575
Just so you know, if any of my clothes
turn out to be magic, they're all yours.

03:02.242 --> 03:03.077
Deal.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.415
As I predicted,

03:08.498 --> 03:12.711
I am walking, house-training
and cleaning up after Max's dog.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.296
Aw, you're lucky you're so cute!

03:15.630 --> 03:16.464
Huh?

03:17.507 --> 03:19.760
Oh! You've got lipstick on you!

03:20.969 --> 03:23.889
Well, you're a Retriever, Cosmo.
Go retrieve!

03:26.141 --> 03:27.642
Congratulations, D.J.

03:27.726 --> 03:30.145
I put your dating profile online
a half hour ago

03:30.353 --> 03:33.523
and you already have 32 pokes, 24 winks

03:33.607 --> 03:35.776
and a love letter
from a guy in San Quentin.

03:38.445 --> 03:40.864
He wants a date in three to five years.

03:42.908 --> 03:45.911
I told you,
I'm not interested in online dating.

03:45.994 --> 03:48.872
Steve asked me out and if
I'm not ready to date my first love,

03:48.956 --> 03:51.041
why would I go out with a total stranger?

03:51.625 --> 03:53.877
You know my motto:
the stranger, the better.

03:56.379 --> 04:01.135
Oh, hey! You're getting a lot of action
here on glutenfreesoccermoms.com.

04:02.469 --> 04:05.847
What did you write on my profile? Wha...?

04:06.431 --> 04:11.103
I'm a neurosurgeon
who's also a Victoria's Secret model?

04:13.021 --> 04:17.567
Sorry, but when you go fishing, you want
the smartest, most scantily-clad bait.

04:19.069 --> 04:24.449
And that's my yearbook photo...
with big photo-shopped knockers.

04:27.368 --> 04:30.497
Actually,
those are Channing Tatum's butt cheeks.

04:32.624 --> 04:34.542
That's why they look so squeezable.

04:41.842 --> 04:44.719
Can somebody get the door?
I'm trying to feed Tommy!

04:44.928 --> 04:46.596
Do you like these carrots or not?

04:47.931 --> 04:50.225
Just give me a sign. A hint.

04:55.605 --> 04:59.776
You have a visitor.
She's English and she's hot.

05:02.154 --> 05:04.656
You are an observant young man.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.745
Oh, my God, Shannon!
What are you doing here?

05:10.954 --> 05:14.749
I came to rescue you.
I saw your Facebook page.

05:14.833 --> 05:18.378
I mean, diaper changes, baby baths.

05:18.586 --> 05:25.135
And you in some horrible pizza restaurant
infested with guitar-playing rodents?

05:26.594 --> 05:28.346
That's Chuck-E-Cheese.

05:28.555 --> 05:30.557
Darling, the name is irrelevant.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.393
The point is
this is obviously a cry for help.

05:35.311 --> 05:37.313
Look, I'm just here for my sister.

05:37.397 --> 05:41.651
I help take care of the kids,
I do a little light housekeeping,

05:41.860 --> 05:44.112
part-time cooking, drive carpools.

05:44.196 --> 05:46.240
What has happened to my life?

05:47.282 --> 05:48.909
Come with me to Coachella.

05:48.992 --> 05:51.786
I've got two seats
on some dude's private jet.

05:51.870 --> 05:54.998
He's the guy that invented the emoji
that looks like this...

05:57.292 --> 06:01.296
No way! I use... this all the time.

06:02.172 --> 06:06.260
And I would love to, but I can't.
It's Mommy and Me Face-Painting Day.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.096
You wanna come?

06:13.850 --> 06:17.020
Okay. Um, this is a cult, isn't it?

06:18.897 --> 06:23.318
If they're holding you here
against your will, blink three times.

06:25.112 --> 06:26.446
It's not a cult.

06:26.529 --> 06:30.325
It's a family, you know, where you
wind up five times a day in a group hug.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.246
Oh, my God, I'm in a cult.

06:38.917 --> 06:43.338
Let's go. The limo is waiting and
that champagne is not gonna drink itself!

06:44.798 --> 06:48.509
Okay, there's laundry in the washer,
Mommy and Me class starts at two

06:48.593 --> 06:50.971
and don't forget Tommy
gets his bottle at six.

06:51.179 --> 06:52.764
I know.

06:53.974 --> 06:56.059
On account of I'm his mother.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.437
I'm not leaving you in the lurch, am I?

06:59.646 --> 07:01.815
No, don't worry. We've got you covered.

07:01.898 --> 07:04.859
I wish I was going with you. Coachella...

07:08.863 --> 07:11.449
What, nobody "woot-woots" anymore?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.162
Put the roof down.

07:16.997 --> 07:18.790
Just so I know, when will you be home?

07:18.999 --> 07:20.541
Like, Monday or Tuesday?

07:20.750 --> 07:24.379
What if you meet a hot guy
that's got a yacht docked in St. Tropez?

07:24.587 --> 07:27.090
Mm... Good point. Maybe Wednesday.

07:30.177 --> 07:33.763
Hey! Did you know there's a limo outside
with champagne?

07:35.098 --> 07:38.977
And coconut shrimp
and mixed nuts and free ice.

07:40.979 --> 07:43.398
Dear God, you're living with gypsies.

07:44.816 --> 07:46.818
- Bye! See you next week.
- Bye!

07:47.694 --> 07:49.445
Let me just take that.

07:50.905 --> 07:53.241
Joke's on her. I had my feet in that ice.

07:57.620 --> 07:59.497
Yeah, I have to get to the pet clinic.

07:59.706 --> 08:03.960
I have Max's recital and now I have Tommy.
Kimmy, can you watch the baby?

08:04.169 --> 08:06.921
I've got a meeting,
but Ramona can watch him.

08:07.005 --> 08:09.716
Yeah, I'd love to help out.
Tommy's adorable.

08:09.924 --> 08:11.676
Oh! Well, I wanna pay you.

08:12.386 --> 08:14.721
Now he's even more adorable.

08:16.264 --> 08:18.433
We take credit, debit or PayPal.

08:19.684 --> 08:23.271
- I'm not prepaying, Kimmy.
- You get double miles.

08:25.899 --> 08:28.484
- Do you know where Aunt Stephanie is?
- She's out of town.

08:28.693 --> 08:29.694
What?!

08:32.072 --> 08:35.991
She has my super-magic scarf!
My recital is tonight!

08:37.202 --> 08:38.619
I'm about to freak out!

08:40.080 --> 08:42.039
Max, Max, Max, Max!

08:42.916 --> 08:44.542
Take a deep breath.

08:45.252 --> 08:47.337
Now let it out slowly.

08:48.963 --> 08:52.675
- You feel better now, right?
- That did nothing.

08:54.010 --> 08:57.138
Status update: I'm doomed.

08:58.514 --> 09:01.559
Max, Max, listen to your big brother.

09:01.768 --> 09:06.981
Whenever you're nervous on stage, just
picture the audience in their underwear.

09:07.190 --> 09:09.359
Are you nuts?

09:09.443 --> 09:11.652
Hit the lights on your way out!

09:13.780 --> 09:15.823
Trust me, it works.

09:15.907 --> 09:17.492
When I ran for class treasurer,

09:17.575 --> 09:20.661
I had to make a speech
in front of the whole entire school.

09:20.870 --> 09:22.872
But you lost.

09:23.081 --> 09:27.168
Yeah, that's because I was imagining
all the girls in their underwear.

09:29.087 --> 09:31.089
And then I forgot my whole speech.

09:33.007 --> 09:37.804
<i>Hola, shalom</i>, howdy-do
and welcome to <i>Ramona's World</i>,

09:37.887 --> 09:41.975
my vlog exploring the world of Ramona,
with your host, Ramona!

09:44.018 --> 09:46.980
Today, I'm babysitting
my little buddy Tommy.

09:47.063 --> 09:49.065
Say hi to the Internet, Tommy.

09:49.149 --> 09:51.192
Hi!

09:51.276 --> 09:53.987
So, if you're thinking
about babysitting...

09:55.863 --> 09:57.824
first, you'll need a baby.

09:58.450 --> 10:00.494
Second, parents with money.

10:00.576 --> 10:01.995
And third...

10:02.829 --> 10:04.956
Well, I guess that's all you really need.

10:06.291 --> 10:07.708
Uh-oh.

10:07.792 --> 10:11.379
My cohost is experiencing
technical difficulties.

10:12.672 --> 10:14.132
In his pants.

10:14.966 --> 10:17.093
This will just take one second.

10:17.177 --> 10:18.636
Here.

10:20.221 --> 10:21.597
It's okay, it's okay.

10:21.681 --> 10:25.393
First tip of diaper changing,
never breathe through your nose.

10:27.312 --> 10:31.107
Second tip, do not look directly
at what you're doing.

10:40.867 --> 10:42.494
By the way, this is a great time

10:42.577 --> 10:46.914
to use up that bottle of J-Lo perfume
your grandma got you for Christmas.

10:53.380 --> 10:54.839
Um...

10:54.922 --> 10:57.342
Maybe we shouldn't have flushed that.

10:58.176 --> 11:00.636
We were never here and you never saw this.

11:14.609 --> 11:16.986
Hey, Max, here's a crazy question.

11:17.070 --> 11:19.780
Why is Cosmo wearing your underpants?

11:21.991 --> 11:23.284
Jackson told me to.

11:23.493 --> 11:25.286
Well, then... carry on.

11:36.464 --> 11:39.926
Tyler, congratulations
on passing the pre-screening.

11:41.553 --> 11:45.223
You have now advanced to a pre-date
meeting to see if you and D.J. click.

11:45.432 --> 11:46.641
I'm so nervous.

11:46.724 --> 11:50.061
I've never met a neurosurgeon
slash Victoria's Secret Angel.

11:51.896 --> 11:53.814
I'm sure she's gonna be just as nervous

11:53.898 --> 11:57.485
meeting a Navy SEAL
slash bestselling romance novelist.

11:58.111 --> 12:01.114
Yeah, we probably
shouldn't talk about work.

12:02.532 --> 12:06.494
Before I introduce you two, I noticed
on your profile, you said you weighed 200.

12:11.666 --> 12:13.334
Seems a little closer to 207.

12:14.919 --> 12:16.129
How did you know that?

12:16.337 --> 12:19.132
I used to guess people's weight
at the carnival.

12:20.634 --> 12:22.636
That must have been an interesting job.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.639
I didn't work there.
I just like picking up guys.

12:30.310 --> 12:31.852
Okay, I'm gonna go find D.J.

12:34.063 --> 12:38.025
My toilet is still clogged and you said
the plumber would be here two hours ago.

12:38.109 --> 12:39.986
Just tell me the truth. Is he coming?

12:40.069 --> 12:41.571
Or is this like the cable TV guy

12:41.655 --> 12:44.574
where I wait from ten to four
and then he shows up at midnight?

12:46.284 --> 12:47.910
Never mind. He's here.

12:48.995 --> 12:50.455
Thank goodness you made it.

12:50.664 --> 12:53.249
Kimmy let me in. I'm Tyler.
You're D.J., right?

12:53.458 --> 12:56.670
Yeah. So are you ready to get started?

12:59.172 --> 13:01.675
Get started? I guess so.

13:02.717 --> 13:04.260
Great. Let's get upstairs.

13:05.637 --> 13:08.515
Upstairs?
You don't wanna talk a little first?

13:09.474 --> 13:12.977
I don't need conversation. I just need
a man to get to work on my pipes.

13:14.187 --> 13:15.229
Whoa!

13:16.105 --> 13:20.443
- You don't waste any time.
- Well, I wish I could do it myself.

13:22.153 --> 13:23.779
Unfortunately, I need help.

13:26.282 --> 13:28.951
Wow! This is going really well.

13:32.205 --> 13:35.791
I need to get to my son's recital,
so how long is this gonna take?

13:37.126 --> 13:39.504
I can be in and out in 15 minutes.

13:39.587 --> 13:40.714
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:40.796 --> 13:42.507
Why are you taking your shirt off?

13:42.716 --> 13:46.594
You brought me into the bathroom. I
figured you wanted to start in the shower.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.765
No, I wanna get started on the toilet.

13:51.849 --> 13:53.560
Okay, your house, your rules.

13:53.768 --> 13:55.978
What kind of plumber are you?

13:56.937 --> 13:58.147
Oh...

13:58.231 --> 13:59.691
I get it.

14:02.985 --> 14:04.820
I'm a naughty plumber...

14:06.364 --> 14:09.158
and you are the lonely neurosurgeon, huh?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.579
D.J., the plumber's here.

14:12.787 --> 14:14.497
- He's here.
- I'm the plumber.

14:14.706 --> 14:17.458
- You're not a plumber?
- I'm a naughty plumber.

14:19.377 --> 14:21.921
That's Tyler.
I found him for you on a dating site.

14:22.129 --> 14:26.718
He's a Navy SEAL and he writes those
romance books you buy at the supermarket.

14:27.927 --> 14:30.137
Okay, somebody, just fix my toilet!

14:30.221 --> 14:33.891
And when I say "toilet,"
I mean the toilet.

14:34.475 --> 14:38.396
If you girls are into plumbers,
check me out on plumbersmingle.com.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.320
So what are you, about 250?

14:53.160 --> 14:55.413
You're getting sleepy.

14:55.496 --> 14:58.082
Go back to your earliest memory.

15:00.126 --> 15:04.880
For you, that might be when I said,
"Go back to your earliest memory."

15:09.844 --> 15:12.263
Why are you hypnotizing Tommy?

15:12.680 --> 15:15.391
To get him to nap. Nothing is working.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.602
Hypnosis isn't real.

15:17.685 --> 15:21.606
Remember that magician at the party
who tried to hypnotize me? It didn't work.

15:21.815 --> 15:23.149
Houseboat.

15:31.407 --> 15:33.868
- Boxcar.
- Forget hypnotizing Tommy.

15:34.076 --> 15:35.244
It's a waste of time.

15:42.084 --> 15:44.504
It is going off in the VIP bathroom.

15:44.712 --> 15:47.173
I just helped Iggy Azalea
find her contact lens.

15:47.256 --> 15:50.635
She was so grateful,
she gave me a hair extension.

15:51.678 --> 15:54.180
- Aren't you glad I rescued you?
- Yes!

15:54.263 --> 15:57.475
Ah! And look at this,
my party timing's back!

15:58.726 --> 16:03.815
Okay, so great news. DJ Unbreakable
went crowdsurfing and got dropped.

16:03.898 --> 16:05.232
He fractured his arm.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.444
DJ Unbreakable... broke?

16:08.653 --> 16:12.990
Yes, and now they need you
on the main stage right now.

16:13.199 --> 16:15.159
- Are you kidding?
- I'm not kidding!

16:15.368 --> 16:17.328
She's not kidding.

16:17.411 --> 16:19.413
Oh, my God! This is amazing!

16:19.497 --> 16:22.208
Ah! Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry!

16:22.416 --> 16:24.210
Here, have a crab leg. There.

16:32.092 --> 16:35.304
You're up next, buddy.
Jackson and I will be cheering you on.

16:35.513 --> 16:37.891
No, you won't.
I'm not going out there, Mom.

16:40.226 --> 16:44.063
I need my super-magic scarf,
but Aunt Stephanie took it.

16:44.271 --> 16:47.149
She took your super-magic scarf?

16:47.358 --> 16:50.570
- What happened to the underwear trick?
- It didn't work.

16:50.653 --> 16:55.658
My puppy was cute, but that crowd
is full of wrinkly old people.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.329
Ugh!

17:01.247 --> 17:03.583
You're right.
That's a lot of granny panties.

17:22.268 --> 17:25.563
Deej, what's going on?
I'm kinda busy. Is everything okay?

17:25.771 --> 17:29.233
<i>No, it's not.
You took Max's super-magic scarf.</i>

17:29.442 --> 17:30.610
<i>What magic scarf?</i>

17:31.026 --> 17:32.486
<i>The one you're wearing?</i>

17:33.905 --> 17:36.741
<i>Ugh! I'm an idiot! Put him on.</i>

17:41.662 --> 17:44.540
<i>It's Max. Remember me?</i>

17:44.624 --> 17:48.294
<i>Oh, Max, I'm so sorry.</i>

17:48.377 --> 17:49.587
<i>But lucky for you,</i>

17:49.670 --> 17:53.841
<i>I can transfer the magical powers of
the super-magic scarf through this phone.</i>

17:53.925 --> 17:57.219
<i>Okay, just touch the screen
and say, "I believe." Ready?</i>

17:59.388 --> 18:01.682
<i>What do you think, I'm in preschool?</i>

18:02.767 --> 18:06.729
<i>Everybody knows
you can't transfer magic over WiFi.</i>

18:08.147 --> 18:11.692
<i>Okay, Max, the truth is
you don't need the scarf.</i>

18:11.776 --> 18:13.820
<i>Play that song now and I'll prove it.</i>

18:14.028 --> 18:18.741
<i>I'll try, but just so you know,
I'm very skeptical.</i>

18:25.289 --> 18:27.458
Okay, what's up, party people?

18:27.667 --> 18:31.045
I've got a special guest
coming live from Harvey Milk Elementary,

18:31.128 --> 18:33.673
Mr. Mighty Max Fuller!

18:35.633 --> 18:38.011
♪ <i>Old MacDonald had a farm ♪</i>

18:40.137 --> 18:42.264
♪ <i>And on this farm he had a duck ♪</i>

18:44.391 --> 18:47.854
♪ <i>With a... here and a... there ♪</i>

18:47.937 --> 18:51.190
♪ <i>Here a... there a... everywhere a... ♪</i>

18:51.398 --> 18:53.442
♪ <i>Old MacDonald had a farm ♪</i>

18:58.614 --> 19:01.826
Oh, come on, you jaded ravers!
He's a little kid!

19:03.160 --> 19:05.997
DJ Tanner, yeah, you rock!

19:07.915 --> 19:09.917
Come on, everybody give it up for Max!

19:10.125 --> 19:13.295
Max, Max, Max, Max!

19:17.675 --> 19:20.135
<i>Max, you just played Coachella.</i>

19:20.219 --> 19:22.763
<i>Thousands of people
are chanting your name.</i>

19:22.972 --> 19:25.140
<i>Holy chalupas!</i>

19:26.100 --> 19:31.313
Max, if you can play Coachella, you can
certainly play a second-grade recital.

19:31.522 --> 19:33.107
<i>Go knock 'em dead, Max.</i>

19:33.315 --> 19:36.652
<i>Thanks, Aunt Stephanie.
We're still friends.</i>

19:36.861 --> 19:38.988
Max, Max, Max!

19:53.086 --> 19:55.295
Oh, wow! Now that was fun!

19:55.504 --> 20:00.093
Emoji guy loved your barnyard samples.
Apparently, he grew up on a farm!

20:01.468 --> 20:05.932
He's flying us all to Lake Como. It's
Clooney's birthday. Let's get on that jet!

20:06.140 --> 20:07.975
I'm... I'm so in!

20:08.059 --> 20:08.893
Ooh!

20:10.103 --> 20:12.312
We can bring two carry-ons, right?

20:14.314 --> 20:17.651
- What are you doing?
- I wanna see how Max's recital went.

20:17.860 --> 20:21.405
No, I pulled you out of that cult.
You're back with your own people now.

20:30.289 --> 20:31.916
Hi, Tommy.

20:31.999 --> 20:35.377
Mommy missed you. Yes, I did.

20:35.461 --> 20:37.337
Yes, I did. I missed you.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.883
- Ramona?
- Huh? What?

20:40.967 --> 20:42.718
Oh, no! Tommy's gone!

20:44.678 --> 20:45.512
He's right here.

20:46.847 --> 20:52.061
Hey, we had some plumbing problems
today. Know anything about that?

20:52.269 --> 20:55.522
Well, I might know something.

20:56.482 --> 20:58.442
See, the truth is...

20:59.902 --> 21:02.279
Tommy flushed his diaper
down the toilet.

21:03.572 --> 21:05.282
Did he now?

21:05.365 --> 21:08.202
Well, that was very poor judgment, Tommy.

21:10.871 --> 21:12.790
I hope you learned your lesson.

21:12.999 --> 21:16.335
Oh, I think he did. He looks really sorry.

21:22.675 --> 21:25.219
Well, no more jumping off
your changing table,

21:25.302 --> 21:28.889
strolling across the floor,
slam-dunking your diaper in the toilet

21:28.973 --> 21:31.308
and vaulting up to the flusher.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.022
Well, I'm off for coffee with Hank.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.151
He's not just a plumber.

21:40.234 --> 21:44.321
He's also an investment banker
slash UFC Heavyweight Champion.

21:51.537 --> 21:56.042
I think you're gonna break a record
tonight and sleep five hours in a row.

22:01.296 --> 22:02.173
Hey, Deej.

22:03.174 --> 22:06.385
Hey! What are you doing back so soon?

22:06.593 --> 22:09.972
- Your text said you were going to Italy.
- I was.

22:10.056 --> 22:13.726
I don't know, I got on the plane
and everybody was drunk and stupid.

22:15.811 --> 22:18.731
Maybe I've just outgrown
that whole party scene.

22:18.814 --> 22:22.818
You should have seen the emoji guy's face
when I told him to turn his plane around.

22:22.902 --> 22:24.153
Something like this...

22:27.740 --> 22:29.950
Hold on. You passed up Italy?

22:30.034 --> 22:34.830
I haven't used my passport in ten years,
and that was just to renew my passport.

22:36.415 --> 22:40.002
I just got to thinking
about everything I'd be missing here.

22:40.211 --> 22:44.339
I missed Max's first recital
and Jackson's gonna start dating soon.

22:44.548 --> 22:46.967
No, he's not.

22:47.885 --> 22:53.182
I definitely don't wanna miss Tommy's
first words: "I love you, Aunt Stephanie."

22:55.184 --> 22:57.228
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

22:57.436 --> 22:59.105
I can't believe I'm saying it,

22:59.188 --> 23:03.400
but these kids,
they've really snuck into my heart.

23:03.483 --> 23:08.322
Ooh... Look who's getting sucked
into the vortex of motherhood!

23:10.241 --> 23:11.366
Yeah.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.747
Hey, Steph, you alright?

23:18.124 --> 23:19.666
I'm fine.

23:20.542 --> 23:23.796
No, you're not. What's wrong?

23:26.048 --> 23:27.841
I really don't wanna talk about it.

23:28.759 --> 23:31.804
Hey, whatever it is, you can tell me.

23:34.932 --> 23:37.017
I can't have children.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.396
Oh, Stephanie.

23:44.150 --> 23:45.567
Are you alright?

23:47.069 --> 23:49.196
I'm okay.

23:49.280 --> 23:54.160
You know, I just found out a while ago.
It's just not gonna happen for me.

23:55.202 --> 23:56.703
Why didn't you tell me?

23:58.247 --> 24:02.084
I was in England
and you had just lost your husband.

24:02.918 --> 24:04.711
You had enough going on.

24:05.712 --> 24:09.049
And I wasn't really thinking
about starting a family then anyway.

24:10.301 --> 24:12.761
But then I moved in here

24:12.845 --> 24:15.181
and I really got to know your kids,

24:16.015 --> 24:18.976
and feel what it was like
to have a family of your own...

24:20.602 --> 24:22.021
Things changed.

24:22.938 --> 24:25.732
I'm so sorry.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.278
Aw, this breaks my heart.

24:32.156 --> 24:36.410
But you should know
that my kids are your kids.

24:36.493 --> 24:39.872
And we appreciate everything that you do.
We love you.

24:47.462 --> 24:52.009
Not that I'm counting,
but that was our fourth hug in a minute.

24:54.928 --> 24:57.139
I can't help it. I'm turning into Dad.

25:00.100 --> 25:04.104
- Stephanie!
- Hi! Hello, hello!

25:05.439 --> 25:06.523
Why are you crying?

25:06.732 --> 25:10.444
Gosh, I'm just really sad
that I missed your first recital.

25:10.652 --> 25:13.364
Well, cheer up. Mom has it on her phone.

25:13.447 --> 25:17.492
You can watch it
over and over and over again.

25:17.701 --> 25:20.495
Good. I love you guys.

25:20.704 --> 25:22.289
Come on, bring it in.

25:23.957 --> 25:25.751
Just in time!

25:30.214 --> 25:32.507
How was coffee with the plumber?

25:32.716 --> 25:34.009
Oh, it was great.

25:34.093 --> 25:37.137
Hank lives on the water in Sausalito,
in a cute little...

25:37.971 --> 25:39.639
- What do you call it?
- Houseboat?

25:49.858 --> 25:52.486
- Boxcar.
- Good night, everybody.
