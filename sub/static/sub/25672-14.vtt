WEBVTT

01:29.980 --> 01:34.990
"Thunder Spears"

01:51.540 --> 01:53.590
Erwin, he's gonna climb up.

02:10.060 --> 02:13.900
All troops! Avoid clashing
with the Armored Titan!

02:14.320 --> 02:16.030
Stay away from him!

02:16.030 --> 02:17.000
Roger!

02:17.610 --> 02:22.070
Hange, why didn't he signal to attack?
What's he thinking?

02:22.070 --> 02:24.160
He's watching the enemy's movements.

02:25.120 --> 02:30.520
Because Reiner and friends prepared
some sort of grand welcome for us.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.420
That quadruped type is carrying
luggage on its saddle.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.600
It wasn't one of those that just transformed.

02:44.220 --> 02:47.220
In which case, is that the enemy's scout?

02:47.890 --> 02:53.230
If it took notice of our approach and
informed Reiner, that must mean...

02:54.520 --> 02:58.360
That quadruped type down there
is an Intelligent Titan.

02:59.450 --> 03:01.490
No, there might even be others.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.490
That Titan... has luggage?

03:05.410 --> 03:06.740
What could it be?

03:22.590 --> 03:26.010
They're moving! Multiple two-
to three-meters approaching!

03:27.060 --> 03:29.620
It's just like the raid at Utgard Castle...

03:30.310 --> 03:32.410
They'll go after the horses first.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.270
Their primary objective
is to capture Eren, but...

03:37.400 --> 03:41.750
To achieve that, they'll take away
our only escape option.

03:42.910 --> 03:46.620
With Wall Maria still being
deep in Titan territory,

03:46.620 --> 03:49.250
we have no means to get back without horses.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.650
Just by killing our horses, it completely blocks
our escape and severs our supply line.

03:56.790 --> 03:58.610
Whether it takes one week or a month,

03:59.090 --> 04:01.920
they can simply wait until
there's nobody who can move.

04:02.680 --> 04:05.010
Without any of the risks of battle,

04:05.550 --> 04:08.980
they can waltz in and take Eren
once he's too weak to resist.

04:10.640 --> 04:15.150
Right now, the fact that all those larger
Titans are staying in formation

04:15.150 --> 04:19.570
is proof that their only
purpose is to cage us in.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.490
Commander! The Armored Titan is close!

04:26.490 --> 04:28.980
And we still don't know where Bertholdt is!

04:29.410 --> 04:31.330
Yeah, I know.

04:32.580 --> 04:35.010
At this point, what I fear most...

04:35.460 --> 04:39.550
...is that Reiner and Bertholdt
slaughter our horses unchecked.

04:40.920 --> 04:41.840
Therefore...

04:43.300 --> 04:45.510
Are you finally ready to say something?

04:45.840 --> 04:47.990
I could've had breakfast during the wait.

04:50.100 --> 04:52.270
Dirk Squad and Marlene Squad!

04:52.270 --> 04:55.810
Protect the horses at the 
gate with Klaus Squad!

04:55.810 --> 04:59.530
Levi Squad and Hange Squad!
Take down the Armored Titan!

05:00.150 --> 05:03.190
Employ the Thunder Spears
at your own discretion!

05:03.190 --> 05:05.430
Achieve your objectives whatever it takes!

05:06.240 --> 05:09.030
This moment! This battle!

05:09.030 --> 05:11.450
The survival of humanity depends on it!

05:12.290 --> 05:13.910
Once more, for humanity...

05:14.660 --> 05:16.790
...give your hearts!

05:17.330 --> 05:18.380
Yes, sir!

05:19.920 --> 05:24.130
You hear that?! Turn the table on
the Titans coming for our horses!

05:24.130 --> 05:24.630
Sir!

05:25.220 --> 05:26.630
Wait! Levi, Armin!

05:28.010 --> 05:31.390
I did say Levi Squad,
but I need you to stay, Levi.

05:32.180 --> 05:34.390
To protect the horses and not Eren?

05:34.770 --> 05:35.510
That's right.

05:37.020 --> 05:39.370
And to strike him down when the chance comes.

05:40.860 --> 05:44.140
You're the only one I can entrust
to take on the Beast Titan.

05:45.990 --> 05:47.240
Understood.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.690
Since I failed to kill that
armored brat earlier,

05:51.030 --> 05:53.620
I'll make up for it with 
the Beast Titan's head.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.900
Armin, I have a plan for the Armored Titan.

06:00.250 --> 06:00.880
Sir.

06:01.630 --> 06:04.260
There are two halves in this
battle for humanity's fate.

06:04.670 --> 06:08.570
And one of them... I'm putting
on Hange and your shoulders.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.410
There they are... all gathered in one place.

06:31.410 --> 06:33.710
I'll kill the horses and make a break for it.

06:34.330 --> 06:35.490
That's good enough.

06:36.330 --> 06:41.980
No matter how strong Captain Levi is,
he's still no match for our War Chief.

06:47.130 --> 06:48.590
That was close...

06:49.300 --> 06:52.840
If I was any slower transferring
my consciousness to my body,

06:53.220 --> 06:54.580
I would've died instantly.

06:56.270 --> 06:59.850
How did they even think
to look inside the walls?

07:01.480 --> 07:03.980
Armin? Was it you?

07:06.820 --> 07:08.740
No... It doesn't matter.

07:09.190 --> 07:13.210
With this, our long journey
is finally coming to an end.

07:21.920 --> 07:23.460
Erwin Smith...

07:24.710 --> 07:27.800
Don't get distracted.
I've got to kill the horses first.

07:36.260 --> 07:36.850
Eren!

07:40.640 --> 07:43.020
Why did he show up unprovoked?

07:43.940 --> 07:47.620
They should be painfully aware
that he's our main objective.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.780
What are you thinking?

07:55.620 --> 07:58.230
To flee south and escape over the wall?

07:58.990 --> 08:02.850
If he's alone, he could escape as
a Titan to Trost without a horse.

08:03.620 --> 08:07.670
And were that to happen, we'd have
no reason to stay here and fight.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.330
Even if we did manage to 
annihilate the Scouts,

08:11.840 --> 08:15.970
we can't let someone who mastered hardening
in two months back in the walls.

08:16.890 --> 08:21.980
If he learns how to harness the
Coordinate's full power, it'll be too late.

08:24.190 --> 08:25.980
No, wait. This is weird...

08:26.980 --> 08:28.940
If he really was escaping,

08:28.940 --> 08:32.929
he would've transformed after using
ODM gear to scale the wall.

08:34.070 --> 08:37.830
Why would he transform when
Shiganshina is surrounded by walls?

08:40.370 --> 08:41.659
I get it!

08:42.330 --> 08:43.860
They're trying to...

08:44.670 --> 08:47.790
...change my target from the horses to Eren!

08:56.430 --> 08:59.420
Not giving me time to think, are we?

09:00.100 --> 09:04.180
Dammit, Commander.
And I climbed way up here...

09:10.440 --> 09:12.280
Good! He took the bait!

09:13.610 --> 09:15.700
He wants to use Eren as bait?

09:16.490 --> 09:18.780
Yes, those were Commander Erwin's orders.

09:19.160 --> 09:23.950
He'd resort to using Eren as bait
just to protect the horses?

09:23.950 --> 09:28.790
You're kidding... And what if Reiner
chooses to kill the horses anyways?

09:28.790 --> 09:31.600
No, he should chase Eren.

09:32.050 --> 09:33.920
If Reiner does go after the horses,

09:34.510 --> 09:38.240
Eren will keep going and wrap
around behind the Beast Titan.

09:38.930 --> 09:43.500
With Levi, the Scouts, and Eren,
they can pincer and fight the Beast Titan.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.440
Erwin must have said that, right?

09:47.100 --> 09:47.690
Yes.

09:48.190 --> 09:52.360
Even if it doesn't go as planned,
by having Eren flee like that,

09:52.360 --> 09:55.060
it'll confuse the enemy enough
to break their ranks.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.120
It all depends if Reiner 
can see that far ahead.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.790
Knowing him, I bet that he will.

10:07.330 --> 10:10.810
All right! We'll take on the
Armored Titan in Shiganshina!

10:12.290 --> 10:13.170
Hold on!

10:13.750 --> 10:15.930
There's one more thing I'm worried about.

10:16.970 --> 10:19.980
Bertholdt is still in hiding somewhere.

10:20.890 --> 10:25.130
The last time they fought, Eren had
Reiner on the verge of defeat, but...

10:26.060 --> 10:30.150
...Bertholdt's attack caught him off guard
and he ended up their captive.

10:33.860 --> 10:38.710
It's a simple counter-strategy,
but let's fight away from the walls.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.120
It might've been a fluke, but...

10:49.330 --> 10:51.330
I've beaten you once already.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.050
I had it in the bag.

10:57.260 --> 10:59.760
One-on-one, I can win.

11:00.930 --> 11:06.280
When it comes to hand-to-hand combat,
Annie was a tougher opponent by far!

11:35.000 --> 11:38.710
Do you have any idea...
where we're standing right now?!

11:42.970 --> 11:44.030
This is the place...

11:49.140 --> 11:50.560
...where I...

11:51.810 --> 11:52.900
...where we...

11:54.860 --> 11:56.750
...once called home!

11:59.150 --> 12:00.450
I'm taking it back.

12:01.570 --> 12:03.450
I'll slaughter you all...

12:05.410 --> 12:07.150
...and take back what you stole!

12:07.990 --> 12:09.190
All of it!

12:09.950 --> 12:14.960
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Thunder Spears"
"A weapon developed to combat the stout defense of the Armored Titan using technology formerly kept secret by the Interior Police. Though challenging to wield, it can deliver a concentrated blow comparable to a strike of lightning."

12:19.670 --> 12:22.760
Recruits! Move the remaining horses west!

12:22.760 --> 12:24.590
Protect the recruits with Dirk Squad!

12:25.550 --> 12:26.510
Where, Marlo?!

12:26.510 --> 12:27.390
Huh?

12:27.390 --> 12:28.760
Where do we tie the horses?!

12:28.760 --> 12:31.730
W-We were told not to put 
them all in one place.

12:32.180 --> 12:33.510
Not here. Farther.

12:33.810 --> 12:35.600
Three- to four-meters coming from the east!

12:41.070 --> 12:43.100
That's... a Titan?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.420
Captain Levi!

12:55.420 --> 12:56.790
Now's our chance! Hurry!

12:57.290 --> 12:59.550
Clean up the small ones already!

12:59.550 --> 13:01.510
Do it before the Beast Titan moves!

13:01.510 --> 13:04.130
And no casualties! Don't you dare die!

13:04.130 --> 13:05.260
Sir!

13:08.550 --> 13:10.550
Shit, this is pathetic.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.520
The weak ones die so fast.

13:14.180 --> 13:15.800
Should've kept 'em up there.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.590
Struggling with three- 
to four-meter Titans...

13:23.150 --> 13:25.300
Casualties all over the place...

13:26.110 --> 13:29.220
The Scouts aren't nearly
as strong as they once were.

13:30.450 --> 13:36.380
However, without all those sacrifices,
we never would have made it this far.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.510
When I was a cadet,

13:43.510 --> 13:47.590
I told the others about my father's
theory which I also believed.

13:48.140 --> 13:51.310
And that once I was a 
Scout, I would prove it.

13:52.260 --> 13:57.460
But after I joined the Scouts,
I stopped talking about it for some reason.

13:59.060 --> 14:01.010
No, that's wrong...

14:02.400 --> 14:05.760
It wasn't some reason. I 
had realized something.

14:06.570 --> 14:10.990
That only I... was fighting for myself.

14:12.120 --> 14:16.710
That only I... had a dream I wanted to see.

14:20.830 --> 14:26.050
Before I knew it, I was giving people orders
and inspiring my comrades.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.890
Saying they should give
their hearts to humanity.

14:31.390 --> 14:33.290
Thus, I fooled my comrades...

14:34.390 --> 14:35.850
Fooled myself...

14:37.350 --> 14:40.130
And upon a mountain of their corpses...

14:41.770 --> 14:43.270
...I now stand.

14:51.120 --> 14:54.720
And yet, the basement lingers
at the back of my mind.

14:56.120 --> 15:01.150
Even if this plan fails, I might be able
to reach the basement before I die...

15:02.420 --> 15:05.010
The basement Grisha Yeager left behind...

15:05.710 --> 15:07.300
The truth of our world...

15:17.600 --> 15:19.390
Those experiments paid off!

15:22.020 --> 15:24.110
These fists are all I need to fight!

15:27.780 --> 15:31.090
By focusing the hardening on
one spot, it gets even stronger!

15:31.740 --> 15:36.700
Since his armor's spread across his
whole body, I can smash it like thin ice!

15:44.880 --> 15:47.770
Too slow, you big oaf!

15:51.130 --> 15:51.680
Shit!

16:37.970 --> 16:38.680
Hange!

16:39.140 --> 16:42.180
Not yet! Everything rides 
on the first attack!

16:42.690 --> 16:45.650
Wait and trust Eren will 
give us a good opening!

16:53.700 --> 16:55.780
That metal rod is your new weapon?

16:56.530 --> 16:58.780
You could at least call it a spear.

16:58.780 --> 17:01.660
The Corps of Engineers really
pulled through for me.

17:02.450 --> 17:06.190
Using technology kept secret
by the Interior Police, that is.

17:06.630 --> 17:12.210
I told them, basically, we needed a weapon
we could use against the Armored Titan.

17:12.210 --> 17:13.740
Against the Armored Titan?!

17:14.630 --> 17:18.140
Our blades were all but useless
against the Armored Titan.

17:19.099 --> 17:22.140
As long as he didn't show
an opening in his hardening,

17:22.310 --> 17:27.490
all we could do was watch Eren fight
the Armored Titan from the sidelines.

17:30.480 --> 17:35.090
It's true... We couldn't stop him taking
Eren away even if we wanted to.

17:36.950 --> 17:41.850
Back then, if the Commander hadn't
drawn a horde of Titans to him...

17:43.540 --> 17:47.920
Thus far, the only attacks effective
against the Armored Titan

17:47.920 --> 17:51.130
have been Eren's strangles 
and locks as a Titan.

17:51.130 --> 17:56.120
Also, we have high hopes for his
"hardened punch" from recent experiments.

17:57.220 --> 18:01.540
However, the mission won't succeed
with only those as our weapons.

18:02.010 --> 18:06.140
While it's important we plug
the wall, more so than that,

18:06.140 --> 18:10.790
we must kill Reiner and Bertholdt,
who are responsible for destroying the wall.

18:12.400 --> 18:17.110
So you're saying... you want us to stab
the Armored Titan with those spears?

18:17.110 --> 18:18.510
It's easier just to show you.

18:19.530 --> 18:20.570
Let's step outside.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.300
It's powerful, as you can see.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.630
It's like a strike of lightning.

18:35.630 --> 18:37.510
Hence the name, "Thunder Spear."

18:38.090 --> 18:41.680
However, is it enough to bring
down the Armored Titan?

18:41.680 --> 18:43.890
We won't know until we try.

18:44.470 --> 18:46.810
It's effective against normal Titans,

18:46.810 --> 18:50.960
but to deal a blow to the Armored Titan,
it'll take a little more work.

19:13.630 --> 19:14.360
Shit!

19:27.220 --> 19:31.610
I guess biting Eren out of there
isn't something I can do by myself.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.380
I've got to resort to that...

19:41.490 --> 19:42.240
Go now!

19:43.410 --> 19:44.490
They're making a move?

19:45.330 --> 19:47.880
I knew they've been gradually
surrounding me, but...

19:48.620 --> 19:50.330
What can they even do 
to me with their blades?

19:51.670 --> 19:55.290
I've got hardened armor covering
every inch of my body.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.340
They can't even scratch me!

20:21.450 --> 20:22.740
We did it?

20:22.950 --> 20:24.490
No, not yet...

20:25.120 --> 20:27.190
The Thunder Spears are so destructive,

20:27.190 --> 20:29.500
they're dangerous even 
to those who fire them.

20:30.200 --> 20:34.500
If you anchor to the Titan as if to
slash it like normal with your blade,

20:34.500 --> 20:36.750
you'll get caught up in the explosion.

20:37.460 --> 20:40.170
Which means the only chance
to use Thunder Spears...

20:40.170 --> 20:43.880
...is when the target is surrounded
by multiple standing objects.

20:45.180 --> 20:49.180
We can only attack with Thunder Spears
in situations exactly like this.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.690
Right here and now, we've got to settle it!

21:06.530 --> 21:07.620
W-We got 'em!

21:08.490 --> 21:11.580
It worked! The armor on 
his nape is peeling off!

21:14.500 --> 21:16.340
R-Really?

21:16.880 --> 21:18.350
The spears worked!

21:18.350 --> 21:19.550
Do it again!

21:19.630 --> 21:22.420
Attack again with Thunder Spears
and finish him off!

21:28.180 --> 21:29.240
Reiner...

21:30.220 --> 21:31.220
You guys!

21:32.310 --> 21:35.060
I thought you were ready
if it ever came to this!

21:35.600 --> 21:36.650
Let's do it!

21:54.830 --> 21:56.760
W-Wait!

23:41.150 --> 23:45.560
If something had been said that day,
could the future have changed?

23:46.440 --> 23:51.600
For all the lives they carry on their shoulders,
they wish for the death of each other.

23:52.530 --> 23:54.680
Next episode: "Descent."

23:54.240 --> 23:56.540
"Descent"
