00:03.747 --> 00:06.747
Welcome, parents
and children of the night!

00:06.831 --> 00:07.872
The back-to-school night.

00:09.164 --> 00:11.831
I love the way my coat smells.

00:11.914 --> 00:13.914
[whispers] Whoa.
Was that teacher a vampire?

00:13.998 --> 00:15.289
We're looking into it.

00:15.372 --> 00:16.872
I love back-to-school night.

00:16.956 --> 00:19.664
It's like a rock concert
where my teachers just sing my praises.

00:19.747 --> 00:21.206
Easy there, hot shot.

00:21.289 --> 00:24.206
Better to play it safe with
my parental expectations.

00:24.289 --> 00:26.706
Was I setting the bar
too low or too high?

00:26.789 --> 00:29.164
I personally think we get
enough school during the day,

00:29.248 --> 00:30.956
we don't need extra
helpings at night.

00:31.039 --> 00:32.497
How about we switch places?

00:32.580 --> 00:34.789
I go to school
and you cover me in the ER?

00:34.872 --> 00:36.872
Just remember the vital
organs go on the inside

00:36.956 --> 00:38.330
before you sew them back up.

00:38.414 --> 00:39.789
Oh, Mom,
you're so precocious.

00:39.872 --> 00:41.455
Oh, I know.

00:41.539 --> 00:43.206
Like my dad always says,

00:43.289 --> 00:46.789
"School is a mix of reading, writing,
and fiery explosions."

00:46.872 --> 00:48.664
Where exactly
did you go to school?

00:48.747 --> 00:50.789
A lot of places.
Some are still standing.

00:51.789 --> 00:52.914
Diogee, go home.

00:52.998 --> 00:54.998
You know dogs
aren't allowed in school.

00:55.081 --> 00:58.081
[whimpers]
♪ It's a sad dog's life ♪

01:00.831 --> 01:02.831
Thanks for picking up
the check, Cavendish!

01:02.914 --> 01:04.664
Well, thank you for
being such a burden.

01:04.747 --> 01:06.497
I left my wallet
in my other track suit.

01:06.580 --> 01:08.706
I mean, my wallet was empty,
but that's where it is.

01:08.789 --> 01:10.914
Just how many track suits
do you actually own?

01:10.998 --> 01:13.330
Are you kidding?
I got six of these puppies.

01:13.414 --> 01:14.872
So, then what do you
wear on Sundays?

01:14.956 --> 01:16.497
Not much.
Oh...

01:16.580 --> 01:18.664
Anyway, you wanted
to show me something?

01:18.747 --> 01:21.998
Yes, I did!
This way! Come on, it's a surprise.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.747
Murphy's dog?

01:23.831 --> 01:25.747
Go home, Diogee.
Yeah, he's cute.

01:25.831 --> 01:28.081
But he's not the surprise.
Oh, oh!

01:28.164 --> 01:30.747
Did you see that? That almost...
Yeah, yeah, you almost died.

01:30.831 --> 01:31.998
Come on. The surprise
is over here.

01:32.956 --> 01:34.664
Ta-da!

01:36.956 --> 01:38.747
Please don't tell me
these are time devices

01:38.831 --> 01:41.372
you've stolen from
Brick and Savannah?

01:43.372 --> 01:45.831
Well?
You told me not to tell you!

01:47.330 --> 01:49.081
Really takes me back, all this.

01:49.164 --> 01:50.956
Would be great to be a kid again.

01:51.039 --> 01:52.872
No responsibilities.

01:52.956 --> 01:54.123
No stress.

01:55.164 --> 01:56.956
It would be great
to be an adult.

01:57.039 --> 01:59.289
You get to call your
own shots and buy stuff.

01:59.372 --> 02:00.580
Anytime.

02:00.664 --> 02:02.747
I could buy a big,
heavy blanket in the summer,

02:02.831 --> 02:03.956
just 'cause I wanted to.

02:04.039 --> 02:06.372
I could tell kids,
"Because I said so",

02:06.455 --> 02:07.872
anytime I wanted.

02:07.956 --> 02:10.872
I could start my own family band,
like the Von Trapp singers.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.872
Yeah, those guys rocked.

02:12.956 --> 02:16.289
I'd like to welcome you all
to back-to-school night.

02:16.372 --> 02:19.455
Kids, please step outside so we can talk
about you behind your backs.

02:19.539 --> 02:20.747
Be good, Dad!

02:20.831 --> 02:22.998
No unnecessary surgeries
while I'm gone, Mom.

02:23.081 --> 02:24.914
Now who's being precocious?

02:24.998 --> 02:25.998
Me! It was me!

02:28.081 --> 02:28.914
[clears throat]

02:28.998 --> 02:30.414
Now, before we get started,

02:30.497 --> 02:31.789
would anyone like
to compliment me

02:31.872 --> 02:34.414
on my hand-crafted,
wooden chair?

02:34.497 --> 02:36.998
It goes with my desk,
which I also made.

02:38.664 --> 02:40.081
You should not have this!

02:40.164 --> 02:41.248
Bad Dakota!

02:41.330 --> 02:42.914
Oh, come on,
I'm gonna give 'em back.

02:42.998 --> 02:44.622
Later. They'll be fun to play with.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.622
Play? What are you, a child?

02:46.706 --> 02:48.998
This is prototype,
portable time-displacement

02:49.081 --> 02:51.081
technology and it's
hugely dangerous.

02:51.164 --> 02:54.289
Yeah, but we'll kick serious
"time butt" with this. Look.

02:54.372 --> 02:56.497
Look! An Age Regressor Ray!

02:56.580 --> 02:58.289
Instead of sending
your body through time,

02:58.372 --> 03:00.206
it sends time
through your body,

03:00.289 --> 03:02.164
changing your
chronological age.

03:02.248 --> 03:04.539
Oh, that's not dangerous.
Just put that down!

03:07.414 --> 03:09.622
Oh, cool! Cool!
Baby thumbs up!

03:09.706 --> 03:11.289
What do you think, huh?

03:11.372 --> 03:12.831
All right.
No more goofing off.

03:12.914 --> 03:14.289
We've got to reverse it.

03:14.372 --> 03:16.372
Baby hand is touching you.
Oh! Don't do that.

03:16.455 --> 03:18.039
Baby hand is touching you.

03:18.123 --> 03:21.956
It's so smooth,
like a baby's bottom, but it's its hand.

03:22.039 --> 03:23.455
It's a baby hand!
Stop touching me!

03:23.539 --> 03:24.539
[gun fires]

03:24.914 --> 03:26.706
Uh-oh!

03:26.789 --> 03:30.956
Texture and wood grain are far more
nuanced than you might think...

03:35.206 --> 03:36.039
[all cheering]

03:37.539 --> 03:39.123
Oh... That can't be good.

03:41.497 --> 03:42.706
-No!
-No!

03:42.789 --> 03:45.998
Come back here, foul canine!
Oh, come on.

03:46.081 --> 03:48.081
No! No! No!

03:48.164 --> 03:48.998
[children laughing]

03:49.414 --> 03:50.580
Mom?

03:52.164 --> 03:53.664
Okay, I'm freaking out.

03:53.747 --> 03:55.872
This is crazy!
How did this happen?

03:55.956 --> 03:57.164
[Zack] What are we gonna do?

03:57.248 --> 03:59.372
Murphy, of course you're here.

03:59.455 --> 04:00.872
Oh, hey, Cavendish,
maybe you could help.

04:00.956 --> 04:03.455
Oh no, are those your parents?
It's worse than I thought.

04:04.914 --> 04:05.872
No! Wait!

04:05.956 --> 04:06.914
Is that Dakota?

04:06.998 --> 04:07.831
[screams]

04:08.664 --> 04:10.039
No! Let go!

04:10.123 --> 04:11.664
What is going on?

04:11.747 --> 04:15.039
That ray gun in your dog's mouth
regressed everyone's age by 90%.

04:15.123 --> 04:16.330
But if I can get it back,

04:16.414 --> 04:18.872
-I should be able to reverse it.
-No!

04:18.956 --> 04:20.248
Diogee! Drop it.

04:21.998 --> 04:23.789
-Oh, dear!
-Uh...

04:23.872 --> 04:24.706
[blabbering]

04:25.455 --> 04:27.539
Give me 20 minutes
to fix it.

04:27.622 --> 04:29.039
All right. Maybe 30.

04:29.123 --> 04:29.956
-Mine! [laughs]
-You!

04:30.123 --> 04:31.914
You come back here, young man!

04:31.998 --> 04:33.123
Okay, while they fix this,

04:33.206 --> 04:36.622
all we need to do is keep our
three-year-old parents safe.

04:36.706 --> 04:38.039
Sounds simple enough.

04:38.123 --> 04:40.206
Yeah, how hard can it be,
they are two feet tall.

04:40.289 --> 04:41.539

05:59.789 --> 06:02.123
How long have these guys
been toddlers?

06:02.206 --> 06:03.956
About... Six minutes.

06:04.039 --> 06:05.455
Our parents are terrible kids.

06:05.539 --> 06:08.372
But to be fair,
we're probably terrible parents.

06:08.455 --> 06:11.872
They'll understand one day
when they have... us.

concert piano?

is harder than I thought.

what we are right now.

Hey.

have to do this?

toddler parents forever!

09:49.789 --> 09:52.956
I'd take Murphy's Law
over parenting any day.

09:57.372 --> 09:58.289
Okay, uh...
[clears throat]

09:58.789 --> 10:00.539
I think we're about
done here.

10:00.622 --> 10:05.706
Uh, thank you all for coming and if you
need me, I'll be polishing my desk.

10:05.789 --> 10:08.455
Huh. Did she talk about
her desk the whole time?

10:08.539 --> 10:10.747
Because I think
I must've zoned out.

10:10.831 --> 10:12.455
Aw, look at them.

10:14.455 --> 10:17.372
I know they're growing up,
but they're still our babies.

10:17.455 --> 10:18.872
Babies of the night.

10:18.956 --> 10:20.123
The back-to-school night!
[laughs]

10:21.330 --> 10:22.414
Definitely a vampire.
