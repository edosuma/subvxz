[narrator]  Previously on  Dynasty:

00:13.471 --> 00:16.349
Among my responsibilities
is running background checks.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.350
I know everything.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.312
-Kori, this is Michael.
-[Fallon] Is that why you slept with Kori,

00:21.396 --> 00:24.107
-to get back at me?
-[Michael] I don't use people.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.358
That's you.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.695
Chief Aaron convinced your dad
to give the club 250 K per year.

00:28.778 --> 00:30.864
It was a million.
I'm about to right a wrong.

00:30.947 --> 00:35.618
-You know, hacking isn't my game anymore.
-I'm going after Stansfield.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.621
Dinner with Kori,
but maybe desert back here.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.791
Ah, no, but I'll never turn down
another bite of that sweet potato pie.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.460
[chuckles] Sounds good.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.004
[in Spanish]
I need to get money to my sister today.

00:46.087 --> 00:50.508
We should have a kid. This tragedy with
Matthew, Willy, Claudia, it's all over.

00:50.592 --> 00:54.387
-This is our chance to start something.
-[in English] Put the past behind us.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.848
[in Spanish]
I want information about Celia Machado.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.058
[in Spanish]
You can go to hell.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.768
We want what's ours.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.188
["Maneater" playing]

♪ She only comes out at night
The lean and hungry type ♪

01:12.739 --> 01:19.162
♪  Oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up ♪

01:19.245 --> 01:24.250
♪  Oh, here she comes
She's a maneater ♪

01:25.752 --> 01:27.003
That was the one.

01:27.086 --> 01:32.175
♪  Oh, here she comes
She's a maneater ♪

01:33.676 --> 01:35.512
-Where's my coffee?
-Fallon.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.722
Good to have you back, I think.

01:38.139 --> 01:43.144
-Mm. Jeff had better coffee at his house.
-Perhaps you should've stayed there.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.940
Come on, Steven.
What? No witty repartee?

01:47.982 --> 01:50.777
You're not still in the ladder
about Stansfield, are you?

01:50.860 --> 01:53.029
No. Just been slammed
with foundation stuff.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.782
-And I'm late.
-[Blake] Morning.

01:56.366 --> 02:00.370
Good morning. The Carrington Atlantic
gift strategists are on their way.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.330
-Should I set them up in the study?
-Please.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.916
-Gift strategists?
-Holiday gifts for our clients.

02:04.999 --> 02:08.836
CA is sponsoring the tree lighting
ceremony in midtown this year.

02:09.294 --> 02:12.382
I thought I'd hand out the gifts then.
Don't tell me.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.552
You forgot
your year-end business presents.

02:15.635 --> 02:19.013
What do you take me for?
Morell Corp has something in the works.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.849
-Do I get one of these gifts?
-[Fallon] No.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.810
Your life's been one big Christmas morning
since you arrived.

02:26.521 --> 02:29.983
What are you gonna do?
About the client gifts you don't have?

02:30.066 --> 02:33.153
-Like I said. It's in the works.
-Your dad might fall for your act,

02:33.236 --> 02:35.029
but he gives you more credit
than you deserve.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.449
We know you have a blind spot when
it comes to thinking about other people.

02:38.533 --> 02:42.453
I have no blind spots.
I see all spots, just like I see you,

02:42.996 --> 02:44.831
eating your croissants while you may,

02:44.914 --> 02:47.208
trying to claim a seat at this table.

02:48.376 --> 02:52.505
But unless you're a Carrington or work for
a Carrington, no one cares what you think.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.965
Especially not me.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.806
Hey, I need a shopping partner
and a ride.

03:04.475 --> 03:08.354
-Oh, looks like someone already got one.
-Have you ever heard of knocking?

03:08.438 --> 03:12.066
I can't just waltz in here
like I own the place? Because I do.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.359
[Fallon chuckles]

03:14.152 --> 03:16.779
-How's the city job?
-The only job I wanna talk about

03:16.863 --> 03:20.909
-is the faux job you gave my boyfriend.
-Faux job? Wow. That's great.

03:21.534 --> 03:25.538
You could argue that me pretending
to blow Culhane was a good thing.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.791
-You two came out stronger than ever.
-Are you tripping?

03:28.875 --> 03:30.585
What is going on?

03:34.672 --> 03:36.424
[smooching noises]

03:38.593 --> 03:40.178
You should change your locks.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.349
[scoffs]

03:45.266 --> 03:48.144
I'd say she wasn't getting enough sugar,
but knowing you...

03:48.228 --> 03:51.689
Fallon, you can't barge in
with no respect for boundaries.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.066
Boundaries?

03:53.733 --> 03:54.901
But we shared pie.

03:54.984 --> 03:59.447
Kori doesn't wanna share a pie, doesn't
wanna be reminded you and I shared pie.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.659
You're using pie as a metaphor,
but I mean actual pie.

04:03.201 --> 04:07.121
Fallon, you can't expect Kori to be cool
with you after what you put her through.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.709
You gotta give us space.

04:21.135 --> 04:23.554
-The doctor will be right with you.
-Thank you.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.522
[Iris in Spanish]
What's taking you so long?

04:32.605 --> 04:34.607
That ex-boyfriend of yours
got you pregnant...?

04:35.149 --> 04:36.359
[in Spanish]
It's going to be fine, Iris.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.903
I'll raise the baby on my own.
You've done with it Sammy.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.113
I have Alejandro.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.698
As if he's any help.

04:41.781 --> 04:42.615
Don't worry.

04:42.699 --> 04:43.866
I can do it alone.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.417
So, everything looks good.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.545
-[in English] Are you sure?
-Were you worried you're pregnant?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.965
Don't be. Your IUD is still effective.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.219
Should protect you from pregnancies
for at least two more years.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.304
Perfect.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.228
Sir, the gift strategists are at the gate,

05:12.312 --> 05:14.522
but you have another guest,
Chief Stansfield.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.107
Coffee, sir?

05:16.190 --> 05:17.900
Or Scotch and cigars perhaps?

05:17.984 --> 05:20.486
-This isn't a social call.
-Ah.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.239
[door closes]

05:23.323 --> 05:26.951
-I know why you're here. You'll have it.
-I don't doubt you're good for the money.

05:27.035 --> 05:30.830
-I'm concerned about your son.
-Steven didn't know what he was doing

05:30.913 --> 05:33.541
-when he moved those foundation funds.
-Seems to me he did.

05:34.625 --> 05:39.088
He's a kid on some dumb moral crusade.
But it's harmless.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.674
He doesn't understand
the value you bring to this family.

05:43.551 --> 05:46.137
I'll talk some sense into him.
You don't need to worry.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.890
You're right I don't. You do.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.434
[Anders] Sorry, sir.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.436
Uh, the gift strategists?

05:54.062 --> 05:56.064
That's right. Christmas is coming.

05:58.941 --> 06:02.862
What good's all the money
if you don't have the freedom to spend it?

06:05.573 --> 06:07.158
Or the family to spend it on?

06:19.545 --> 06:20.463
What is this?

06:20.546 --> 06:22.965
'Tis the season to show our clients
how much we appreciate them

06:23.049 --> 06:25.468
and to show our competitor's clients
how much they're missing out.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.969
Aren't we doing a holiday party?

06:27.053 --> 06:29.597
People forget parties
as soon as the hangover fades.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.017
If we can butter up CA's clients
by giving them a present,

06:33.101 --> 06:37.063
maybe some will be swayed to meet with us.
Let me show you what I've got.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.691
[man] An entry-level Patek Philippe
for 20,000.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.861
A watch meant to be passed
from generation to generation.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.322
A private island available for client use.

06:46.906 --> 06:50.785
It comes with its own villa,
butler and staff. And a yacht.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.204
[man] Speyside single malt from 1946.

06:53.287 --> 06:56.040
One pour is worth nearly $1000.

06:56.124 --> 06:59.001
[Fallon] Your typical blinged-out
power bank with real bling.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.796
[man] Clubs and caviar.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.383
Gold, diamonds and electricity
never lose their value.

07:05.466 --> 07:09.220
Presented with Petrossian caviar,
valued at 1000 per tin.

07:10.012 --> 07:13.141
Something for everyone. I need to get on
with my day. Anything else?

07:13.224 --> 07:15.601
And who doesn't love puppies?

07:15.685 --> 07:19.230
Especially ones that have been genetically
engineered to fit in stockings.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.732
I think we need to dial it back.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.735
We're a startup.
Keep it to three figures per client.

07:25.319 --> 07:28.072
Three figures?
My haircut costs more than that.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.532
Monica can help.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.160
She handles gifts for Colbyco
and gets the brand.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.247
Fine. My father hands his out
at the tree lighting,

07:36.330 --> 07:38.833
so we'll messenger ours out next week.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.085
So, you're going to the lighting ceremony?

07:42.044 --> 07:44.922
-You wanna go together?
-Well, I usually go with Culhane,

07:45.006 --> 07:47.592
but I figured his girlfriend
wouldn't be down with that.

07:49.218 --> 07:53.806
You know what? I just realized what I'm
giving Culhane for Christmas this year.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.516
-Space?
-No.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.978
-I'm going to make a new friend.
-Who?

07:59.061 --> 08:00.646
-Don't say Kori.
-Kori.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.236
That's right.
I need to talk to the security team.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.656
What are you doing in here?

08:11.324 --> 08:13.951
I wanted to drop this off.
It's my résumé.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.622
And a little powdered sugar. Sorry.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.583
It just so happens
that I have a PhD in shopping

08:20.666 --> 08:23.085
and a master's in how to be memorable.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.839
I can find you a gift that'll keep you
at the top of your clients' minds.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.716
You know nothing about my clients.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.051
But I know your competition.

08:31.385 --> 08:34.472
Fallon's desperate to top you and to
send her gift to your entire client list.

08:34.554 --> 08:35.640
[cell phone buzzing]

08:37.475 --> 08:39.727
I don't have the bandwidth
to deal with this now.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.188
Perfect. I'll deal with it for you.

08:45.233 --> 08:49.320
Those are seven high-profile cases
that Stansfield's been involved in.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.573
If you pull those police records,
I bet we'll find something incriminating.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.910
Hacking into Atlanta P.D. records?
That's illegal.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.747
It was also illegal for Stansfield
to question you as a murder suspect

08:59.830 --> 09:03.543
because my father told him to. No one
should be able to buy the law like that.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.632
Say I'm game.
I don't see Blake's name in here.

09:09.715 --> 09:13.469
He would lawyer up so hard, Stansfield
might end up slipping away as well.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.180
Yeah, I'm pretty familiar
with Blake's lawyers.

09:16.264 --> 09:20.518
Not to mention, any strike on him
would blow back on all of us.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.229
You're in business with my sister now.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.566
For our family,
that means more than marriage.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.224
[gasps]

10:07.189 --> 10:10.526
I don't know what else to cut.
With this budget, we'd have to power down

10:10.610 --> 10:12.987
every public library
the last two weeks of December.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.948
I don't mean to intrude,
but I got you a ticket

10:16.032 --> 10:18.367
to the annual
Carrington Tree Lighting Ceremony.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.579
The tree lighting may be sponsored
by Carrington Atlantic,

10:21.662 --> 10:24.832
but it's a city event,
in front of city hall where I work.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.251
Why would I need your invitation?

10:27.335 --> 10:29.295
Why are you really here, Fallon?

10:29.378 --> 10:31.714
Culhane is my friend
and you're his girlfriend.

10:31.797 --> 10:35.092
It stands to reason that you and I
are gonna run into each other a lot.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.010
Is that a threat?

10:36.093 --> 10:39.347
No, I'm just saying you and I
should be friends for all of our sakes.

10:39.430 --> 10:43.392
So, you want me to make it more convenient
for you to spend time with my man?

10:43.476 --> 10:46.896
It's not just about Culhane.
I mean, I will be the first to admit,

10:46.979 --> 10:49.398
-I don't have many girlfriends.
-How can that be?

10:49.482 --> 10:52.401
Come on, Kori. You're making this harder
than it needs to be.

10:52.485 --> 10:57.156
It's not like Culhane and I were in love.
It was just booty calls and limo sex.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.243
-Tell that to him.
-Wait, he said it was more than that?

11:02.495 --> 11:05.039
And that is exactly
why we aren't hanging out.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.917
[Monica]  Why are you still
barking up that poor girl?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.461
I thought that if I tried
to make friends with her...

11:10.544 --> 11:14.048
Let him go, Fallon. Close the door.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.759
Can we focus?
Morell is super innovative, right?

11:16.842 --> 11:20.888
What if we give a tech gift? Like one of
those waterproof cameras or an e-reader?

11:20.971 --> 11:23.933
I'm sorry, I fell asleep
and woke up in 2010.

11:24.016 --> 11:28.104
If we do tech, it has to be cutting-edge.
Something everyone wants.

11:28.687 --> 11:29.980
Is that a pic from the Bahamas?

11:30.064 --> 11:32.691
Just one of the thousands
of selfies I took.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.778
Rum and coconuts are not that fun
when you're by yourself.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.698
-Wasn't Jeff with you?
-Yeah, but he's my brother,

11:39.782 --> 11:42.284
-so it doesn't count.
-Oh, my God. You are so lying.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.913
-If Jeff wasn't with you, who was he with?
-Nobody special, okay?

11:45.996 --> 11:47.957
Let's just get back to the gifts.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.084
Here's a pitch.
You can never go wrong with tequila.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.754
Tell that to your parents. Look, Sam,
this is a work zone for people with jobs.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.549
Jobs where you can wear pajamas all day?
Sign me up.

11:56.632 --> 12:00.219
-Gigi Hadid wore these last week.
-In fact, I have a business proposition.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.597
With the, uh, proper financial incentive,

12:03.681 --> 12:06.434
-I can tell you what your dad's giving.
-Wow. Great idea.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.687
Or I could walk into his study for free
and find out for myself.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.774
Oh, I know what we can give.

12:14.275 --> 12:18.112
Jeff knows a guy who can get the Google
Pixel. That phone's selling out all over.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.865
We can get him to hook us up
with a shipment.

12:20.948 --> 12:24.452
Something everyone wants.
Cutting-edge tech. It's perfect.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.494
I'll call Jeff.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.719
[screams]

12:50.311 --> 12:53.105
I'll let you know
if I find anything useful in those cases.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.190
I owe you.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.745
[grunting]

13:18.088 --> 13:21.550
[Anders] I knew you had a fishy past,
but real fish?

13:21.634 --> 13:25.137
That's a bit on the nose. I kept your
secret because I thought I was dealing

13:25.221 --> 13:29.099
with a harmless gold digger, but when
the gold digger has gold diggers...

13:29.850 --> 13:32.311
-I think it's time to come clean.
-You can't tell Blake.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.356
He'll never look at me the same way again.

13:36.732 --> 13:39.443
Says here they want 300,000.
Let's hope it's in bolivars.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.361
It isn't.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.367
Back in Caracas, my sister and I stole
from some bad people.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.494
-Exporters.
-Fishermen by chance?

13:48.577 --> 13:51.997
That was just their cover.
We didn't know how dangerous they were.

13:52.081 --> 13:56.252
We needed cash. It was a medical
emergency. We had no other choice.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.463
-Now these men followed me here.
-Not hard, considering

13:59.547 --> 14:03.384
-you're in the headlines every other week.
-I don't know who else to turn to.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.345
You manage the accounts.

14:07.179 --> 14:11.183
-You could access those kind of funds.
-Keeping your secret is one thing.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.143
Participating is another.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.897
I'm sure you'll find a way,
by hook or by crook.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.572
[Steven] What do you want?

14:25.364 --> 14:27.408
Money? I can call my father.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.120
Please, we can work this out.

14:34.456 --> 14:35.291
What the hell?

14:36.041 --> 14:39.003
You did this? You had me kidnapped

14:39.086 --> 14:41.338
-by our own security guys.
-You're lucky it's me.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.508
-Next time, it is going to be Stansfield.
-Are you completely insane?

14:44.592 --> 14:48.220
You've been going on and on about
Stansfield! I've tried talking to you,

14:48.304 --> 14:51.640
distracting you. How am I to get you
to understand how serious this is?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.976
-You have to stop messing with him.
-How can I?

14:54.059 --> 14:56.270
He killed someone.
How can you be so unconcerned

14:56.353 --> 15:00.149
-that your puppet took an innocent life?
-I am very concerned for your life!

15:01.317 --> 15:03.569
-He'd turn on us?
-I don't know how far he'll go,

15:03.652 --> 15:06.739
but I do know what he's capable of.
I know he can get away with it.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.157
We are not invincible.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.159
Just rich.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.496
If you care about this family,
you will leave this alone.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.802
-What are you doing here?
-You don't understand boundaries,

15:28.886 --> 15:31.680
so why should I?
Why'd you go see Kori?

15:32.806 --> 15:36.226
I was "adulting." I asked her if she
wanted to hang out at the tree lighting

15:36.310 --> 15:37.436
and she stonewalled me.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.314
I told you to give us space
and you tried to poach my date?

15:41.523 --> 15:44.234
Wait, you're taking her
to the tree lighting?

15:44.318 --> 15:48.697
But that's our thing. I mean, we've
always gone together. It's our spot.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.409
Fallon, these boundaries aren't
just for Kori. They're for me.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.120
I can't do this every day.

15:55.788 --> 15:59.291
I think about you when I shouldn't
and I need to get you out of my head.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.003
Or we'll fall back into what we had.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.339
Would that be so wrong?

16:07.508 --> 16:09.802
Yes. It would.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.807
I'm trying to move on.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.608
[cell phone buzzing]

16:26.235 --> 16:28.821
Hey, I just got a text from our contact.

16:28.904 --> 16:32.282
Apparently he got another inquiry
about those client gifts you're after.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.493
-From who?
-That's what I'm waiting to hear.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.913
I thought you might know something.
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

16:39.456 --> 16:43.377
Hey. Do you still wanna go
to that tree lighting together?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.801
I looked into those cases.
Stansfield's a cop

16:50.884 --> 16:54.179
who's good at making his own rules
and covering his tracks.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.558
-Remember Willy Miller?
-The guy who killed Blaisdel?

16:57.641 --> 16:59.268
The truth is, he was set up.

17:01.061 --> 17:04.940
I'm sure Stansfield murdered Willy
and made it look like a suicide.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.525
How do you know this?

17:07.192 --> 17:10.654
Because Stansfield did it
to keep suspicion off me and my dad.

17:10.738 --> 17:15.159
Neither of us had anything to do with
Matthew's death. Stansfield went rogue.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.869
That means we can use Willy's murder
to take him down.

17:17.953 --> 17:21.623
But shining the light on Willy
could blow back on you and Blake.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.835
I've never seen my father
the way he was last night.

17:24.917 --> 17:28.338
He was scared. That tells me
he's lost control of Stansfield.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.675
What if Stansfield scrubbed
those records, too?

17:31.759 --> 17:34.928
We'll have to get him
to incriminate himself somehow.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.431
I'm working on behalf of Blake Carrington.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.768
Exactly. If you could rush it,
we'd really appreciate it.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.979
Uh, money's no object.

17:45.147 --> 17:48.108
No, happy holidays to you. Thanks.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.526
Hey, slow down.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.487
What's wrong?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.157
-Nothing.
-Like hell. I know that walk.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.871
Have you spoken to Iris recently?

18:00.954 --> 18:04.166
Um, the day before yesterday, I think.
What's up?

18:04.792 --> 18:08.337
Nothing. I was sending her money
every month through a transfer service,

18:08.420 --> 18:11.715
and they shut down.
I just need to find a new solution.

18:12.049 --> 18:15.219
-Or maybe it's time to bring her here.
-It's actually the worst time.

18:15.302 --> 18:19.139
Why? You know how bad
things are in Venezuela.

18:19.681 --> 18:23.644
It doesn't matter how much money you have.
There's no medicine, there's no food.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.232
I know things are complicated
between you two,

18:28.315 --> 18:31.902
but if you really cared, whatever money
you're planning on sending her,

18:31.985 --> 18:33.779
you'd use it to get her out of there.

-And you can tell your slut sister

18:40.244 --> 18:44.081
she can live out on the streets
once the baby is born.

18:44.164 --> 18:47.459

-Don't tell me what I can't do!

18:47.543 --> 18:48.752
[Iris screams]

18:50.879 --> 18:53.715
[Anders] Did you make a decision?
Holiday gifts all set?

18:53.799 --> 18:55.634
I think it's just gonna be the classic.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.763
-Scotch and cigars.
-What your father sent out every year.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.474
-And he built quite an empire.
-He didn't have a daughter

19:02.558 --> 19:05.394
working against him
or a son working against himself.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.647
And yet you're trying to secure
the Carrington legacy

19:08.730 --> 19:10.816
with the aid of a woman
of questionable history

19:10.899 --> 19:13.819
-and suspect moral character.
-Cristal? What do you mean?

19:13.902 --> 19:16.321
-Do you really wanna know?
-Your opinion?

19:17.865 --> 19:23.036
Staff's? Everybody has something to say
about Cristal, her affair, her sex tape.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.831
But what no one's talking about
is just how far she's come.

19:25.914 --> 19:29.501
-No one handed her her fortune.
-No, she snatched it for herself.

19:29.585 --> 19:33.338
Exactly. You know, my own father
didn't come to our wedding.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.424
He didn't approve of her pedigree.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.135
I didn't choose her
because of where she came from,

19:38.218 --> 19:40.387
just like she didn't marry me
for my baggage.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.431
We're trying to move on.

19:44.183 --> 19:48.353
As for our baby, don't worry.
We won't make you change diapers.

-And I'm supposed to believe that?

What was I supposed to say?

I like you.

but while I was visiting Kori at work,

26:13.154 --> 26:16.283

an energy budget crisis.

All the public libraries will be
shutting down for the holidays.

26:20.161 --> 26:22.747
Wanting to help my friend,
I convinced my dad

26:22.831 --> 26:24.708

26:24.791 --> 26:28.253
not just for December
but for the next five years.

-What?
-You were with him

41:05.880 --> 41:07.548
'cause it was easy for you.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.634
Convenient. You don't have time
for a real relationship.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.971
You're too busy conquering the world.
Where else are you gonna find someone

41:14.054 --> 41:17.141
with your same schedule?
I could fit you in.

41:18.976 --> 41:20.186
If you could fit me.

41:20.811 --> 41:21.896
I'm sorry.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.273
You wanna be my rebound?

41:24.356 --> 41:26.984
[snickers] Isn't that why you're here
so late?

41:30.404 --> 41:33.491
And didn't you say that we should
keep this strictly business?

41:34.366 --> 41:36.118
We're at work, aren't we?
