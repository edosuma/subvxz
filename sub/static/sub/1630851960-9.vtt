10:02.101 --> 10:04.020
Listen, we gotta do something,
Yessika don't play.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.315
Hey, hey, hey... Relax!

10:07.398 --> 10:10.526
Take a deep breath. Center yourself.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.404
[clicks tongue] Let's just talk to her.
Two words:

10:13.779 --> 10:18.200
-[prolonged] conflict resolution.
-What the hell's gotten into you?

10:18.284 --> 10:20.745
I've been listening
to Eckhart Tolle's audiobooks.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.580
My stillness speaks.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.790
Seriously?
You've been listening to Eckhart Tolle?

10:24.874 --> 10:27.877
You think the path to enlightenment
is just for you white-washed Mexicans?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.004
-[Casimiro, in Spanish] What's going on?
-[door shuts]

10:30.087 --> 10:31.756
[in Spanish] I thought it was
an emergency.

10:31.839 --> 10:34.508
Yessika came by. She got in a fight
with this fool, and he got scared.

10:34.592 --> 10:35.426
That's not accurate.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.386
She wants to protest the shop
over the food tour.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.388
[Chris] Guys, I was thinking...

10:40.097 --> 10:43.309
maybe Yessika was right.
Yeah, we need customers, but...

10:43.934 --> 10:45.478
maybe this isn't the way to do it.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.230
I mean, Chuy finally stopped asking
if I could speak Spanish!

10:48.314 --> 10:51.525
Oh, okay, Mr. Identity Crisis.
We'll pay the rent with your Spanish.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.154
[in Spanish] Yessika's like family.
She won't protest over one event.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.406
[in Spanish] She just needed
to speak her mind.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.701
Pop, if she doesn't protest the shop,
she'll send her little homegirls to do it.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.162
[Erik sighs]

11:04.038 --> 11:05.790
Maybe we could use this to our advantage.

11:06.040 --> 11:06.916
[curious music plays]

11:07.083 --> 11:08.668
Listen, we're not stupid.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.712
We understand what foot traffic
in this community does.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.130
We're fighting for our lives here.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.882
We're fighting to save the shop.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.217
[in Spanish] But how?

11:20.054 --> 11:22.765
-[drums fingers]
-There's nothing gentrifiers hate more

11:22.890 --> 11:24.642
than being called gentrifiers.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.103
Yeah. That's a good point.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.106
That's exactly what
Yessika's protest does.

11:30.189 --> 11:33.317
It'll scare away our hipster foodies
by tapping into their biggest fear.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.277
-Brown lesbians?
-White guilt.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.696
[together] Oh...

11:37.029 --> 11:39.365
So, how do we get them
to cross the picket line

11:39.448 --> 11:41.450
and spend more of their money
on our specialty menu?

11:43.411 --> 11:45.538
Don't worry. It was a rhetorical question.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.624
Let's lean into the spectacle of it all.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.961
Create a piece
of next-level immersive performance art.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.797
-Ah, okay. I still don't get it.
-[in Spanish] What?

11:55.214 --> 11:58.259
Let's make the protest
seem like it's part of the food tour!

11:58.926 --> 12:00.678
Like George C. Wolfe's The Colored Museum!

12:00.761 --> 12:02.096
[curious music continues]

12:02.263 --> 12:06.058
Teatro Campesino and it's satirization
of the foreman-fieldworker relationships!

12:06.142 --> 12:08.728
-Pass.
-[in Spanish] I met Cesar Chavez once.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.438
[in Spanish] He really loved buche tacos.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.815
Really? I would've thought
he was more of an asada man.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.567
-No, no. Buche.
-[Erik] Nayeli.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.278
What do I always tell you to do
when you're selling your chocolates

12:17.361 --> 12:18.529
for your school fundraiser?

12:19.113 --> 12:21.741
Pick a shirt from the bottom
of the hamper, don't brush my hair,

12:21.824 --> 12:23.784
-look extra poor?
-And what happens?

12:23.868 --> 12:25.077
I sell out in an hour.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.246
Exactly! It's performance, it's--

12:27.329 --> 12:28.497
It's a stereotype.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.999
It's a reclaiming of a narrative.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.041
Okay.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.295
Okay, all right. I...

12:34.795 --> 12:37.298
-don't get it yet.
-Of course you don't get it.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.550
Erik, let's school this fool.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.593
Let's.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.594
[hands clap]

12:44.722 --> 12:45.598
[knife tapping]

12:45.681 --> 12:48.434
[Connie] Bro, we gotta send a signal
to the rest of Boyle Heights.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.103
A show of solidarity, like a warning

12:51.187 --> 12:53.856
to any other locals
thinking about pulling this kind of shit.

12:53.939 --> 12:57.526
You know I love stunting on a megaphone,
but this is Mama Fina's.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.946
Not some new brunch spot
serving 18-dollar churro waffles.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.241
Okay, but we can't make an exception
when it comes to accountability?

13:04.325 --> 13:06.285
How many of our parents call Pop compadre?

13:06.827 --> 13:09.580
How many times did we go there
after school growing up?

13:09.663 --> 13:10.539
[distant chatter]

13:10.623 --> 13:14.627
How many of us knew we could be queer,
brown, and badass thanks to Norma?

13:14.710 --> 13:17.046
This isn't about Pop or Norma.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.673
This is about coconut-ass Chris
crossing a line.

13:19.757 --> 13:23.177
-This is about Pop trying to survive.
-Yeah! But at our expense!

13:23.260 --> 13:24.929
Yessika, this is our neighborhood.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.765
And what they're doing
is putting us at risk. Uh-huh.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.266
Ana has to do something.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.435
-[birds chirping]
-[knife tapping]

13:31.519 --> 13:32.728
[cell phone buzzes and chimes]

13:32.853 --> 13:33.979
[Connie sighs heavily]

13:35.231 --> 13:36.565
[phone screen clicks open]

13:36.649 --> 13:37.608
Oh, shit.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.109
[in Spanish] What?

13:39.777 --> 13:41.612
[Chris] Mm-mmm...

13:41.821 --> 13:44.323
-[upbeat music plays, scratches suddenly]
-[gasps] Oh, my God!

13:44.782 --> 13:47.618
-[coughs] It's Mama Fina's!
-[mariachi music plays]

13:47.701 --> 13:48.786
[indistinct yelling]

13:48.911 --> 13:50.830
[in Spanish] No justice. No tacos.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.123
[in Spanish] Eat shit,
Christopher Columbus!

13:53.207 --> 13:54.875
That's right, Christopher Columbus!

13:54.959 --> 13:56.085
[indistinct yelling]

13:56.502 --> 13:59.922
-[Chuy, in Spanish] Eat shit! Get out!
-[in Spanish] Hey! Get out!

14:00.422 --> 14:01.423
[door whooshes open]

14:01.549 --> 14:03.467
-What's up homeboy?
-Oh, you're a cholo.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.177
You tired of Echo Park, huh?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.429
Over the breweries in the art district,
in Boyle Heights?

14:07.513 --> 14:09.890
'Cause you heard Mama Fina
[yelling] has the best tacos in LA!

14:09.974 --> 14:11.433
-Well, you heard right, fool!
-[gasps]

14:11.934 --> 14:14.103
This Sunday, come take a bite
of Boyle Heights...

14:14.186 --> 14:15.813
before it's gone forever.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.399
-[Chris] Ah...
-[Casimiro chuckles]

14:18.482 --> 14:20.609
[in Spanish] Please. Please...
-[ding]

14:20.693 --> 14:24.446
[Chris] Not only do you get to go on
a food tour, you also get to participate

14:24.530 --> 14:27.324
in a sweet-ass live protest, which means

14:27.408 --> 14:29.368
you get to help out
a small family business

14:29.451 --> 14:32.079
[surfer voice] while also checking
your privilege!

14:32.162 --> 14:33.497

[Chris] And we'll see you at...

14:39.837 --> 14:42.506
[all together] Mama Fina's!

14:42.756 --> 14:44.967
-Fuck.
-Now do you get it?

14:45.509 --> 14:48.012
-We have to do something about this!
-[phone screen clicks closed]

14:48.304 --> 14:50.806
We don't have to stop
eating there, though, right?

14:50.890 --> 14:51.807
[birds chirping]

14:51.932 --> 14:52.892
-Right?
-Girl.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.228
Natalia! "Before it's gone forever!"

14:56.437 --> 15:00.316
Shoot. There's like a fine line
between satire and stereotype,

15:00.399 --> 15:03.235
and they crossed it.
Ain't nothing funny about that shit!

15:03.611 --> 15:06.196
-Okay, wait, but this is my family.
-And this is our neighborhood.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.698
They're just trying to make a buck.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.826
We get it, they're trying to survive.
But this isn't the way.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.078
Why are we surprised?
They're a bunch of sellouts.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.165
-[in Spanish] Like their vendida cousin.
-No, bitch. Don't call her no sellout.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.126
If she wasn't your girlfriend,
would you be saying that?

But this is Chris's doing.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.178
He's not from around here.
He doesn't know any better.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.555
Look,

15:31.931 --> 15:35.100
I can't tell Pop not to do
what he needs to do to save the shop.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.479
Just like I can't tell you not to do what
you need to do to defend Boyle Heights.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.441
-I'll see you later.
-[kisses]

15:48.864 --> 15:52.743

-Today is a new day at Mama Fina's.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.456
The day we stake our claim to victory.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.960
All the hard work, the sacrifice

16:01.919 --> 16:03.379
has led us to this moment.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.798
But make no mistake.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.342
It will take everything we got.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.303
-[box slides]
-And I mean everything.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.766
-Including these brand-new uniforms.
-I am not wearing that bougie Mangia shit.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.477
-Yeah, hard pass. Hard pass.
-I'm not taking fashion advice from you.

16:18.560 --> 16:22.106
Okay, but it looks clean, it looks great.
I was trying to pump you guys up. Come on.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.734

-Come on. Come on...

-It's one small step for man.
-[inspirational music continues]

16:29.488 --> 16:30.406

[Velcro tears]

16:41.875 --> 16:42.710
Fine. Whatever.

16:51.635 --> 16:53.512
-Thanks.
-I got you, Li' Bro.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.727
I'm gonna airdrop the playlist,
so you guys can dress up to it. Okay?

17:00.352 --> 17:02.938
[music on phone becomes background music]

Golly, we are a good-looking group

20:39.196 --> 20:42.324
Connie's been a regular at Taco Tuesday
since I can remember.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.285
-[chanting continues]
-We gotta do something.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.039
Yeah. Send the old guy
and the cute kid to make nice.

20:49.122 --> 20:50.457
Real original, cuz.

20:50.707 --> 20:51.541
[cheery music plays]

20:51.625 --> 20:56.129
Free horchata! Mama Fina's loves you all,
even if you don't love us back!

20:56.213 --> 20:58.215
[crowd chanting in Spanish]

21:00.592 --> 21:02.469
[in Spanish] Drink one. It's hot out.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.723
Natalia, don't you dare.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.060
You know I have to hydrate
every 37 minutes or I get faint.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.270
-Oh!
-Ay!

21:11.353 --> 21:12.396
[chanting continues]

21:12.521 --> 21:13.730
Sorry, Pops.

21:14.564 --> 21:17.901
[in Spanish] We defend the hood!
We don't sell it!

21:17.985 --> 21:21.280
[in Spanish] We defend the hood!
We don't sell it!

21:23.115 --> 21:24.741
[in Spanish] What are you doing?

21:26.118 --> 21:27.703
[in Spanish] Yessi, seriously?

21:29.496 --> 21:31.498
[chanting in Spanish continues]

21:35.377 --> 21:37.254
[in Spanish] I care about this community,
Pop.

21:37.337 --> 21:40.465
[in Spanish] So do I.
I'm part of the community.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.426
[in Spanish] Then why bring
these people here?

21:42.551 --> 21:44.303
[in Spanish] You're better than this, Pop.

21:44.970 --> 21:45.971
[in Spanish] Look at them.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.723
[camera shutters]

21:47.848 --> 21:50.142
You're selling our soul,
and they're buying.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.101
Yessika!

21:52.853 --> 21:53.895
[in Spanish] This is wrong.

21:54.062 --> 21:56.732
[in Spanish] Maybe you don't see it now,
but in the short or long run,

21:56.815 --> 21:59.067
-this community will suffer!
-What the hell are you doing?

21:59.151 --> 22:01.486
None of this started happening
until you got here.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.155
You think this is happening
because of me?

22:03.238 --> 22:04.990
I told you,
the landlord tried to evict us.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.075
Oh, did the landlord
create this fucking food tour?

22:07.159 --> 22:09.494
Did the landlord create
that dumbass video? No! You did.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.079
It was my idea!

22:12.456 --> 22:14.082
-What?
-I came up with the video.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.500
And it worked!

22:16.209 --> 22:19.087
Listen, if it's us against them,
I choose us. You got a problem with that?

22:21.173 --> 22:22.090
I do.

22:24.217 --> 22:27.846
-Hey, what the hell is going on?
-Why don't you ask your girlfriend here?

22:27.971 --> 22:28.972
[mellow music plays]

22:29.306 --> 22:30.349
[chanting continues]

22:32.351 --> 22:33.185
Please.

22:38.148 --> 22:41.860
[crowd, in Spanish] We defend the hood!
We don't sell it!

22:42.027 --> 22:45.447
[in Spanish] We defend the hood!
We don't sell it!

22:45.572 --> 22:49.284
[in Spanish] We defend the hood!
We don't sell it!

22:49.368 --> 22:52.746
[in Spanish] We defend the hood!
We don't sell it!

-[engines rumble]
-[mellow music continues]

22:56.708 --> 22:57.542
[Chris] Yo!

22:58.794 --> 23:00.754
Even with Yessika acting all Norma Rae,

23:01.296 --> 23:04.424
we cleared three times what we expected.
We made enough rent for next month.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.342
What?

23:05.967 --> 23:09.137
Yo, we do this a couple more times,
we can stash up enough cash.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.432
Lock in the new lease at the same rate.
Booya, Rob!

23:12.557 --> 23:15.685
-[in Spanish] May God hear you.
-Hey, nothing talks like money.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.438
-Proud of you, cuz.
-Hey, what are you talking about?

23:18.522 --> 23:20.482
-[hands slap]
-It was your idea that got attention.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.985
[in Spanish] I'm proud of both of you.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.280
[indistinct groaning]

23:28.657 --> 23:29.491
[kisses]

23:32.119 --> 23:33.370
[Erik sighs] Oh, okay! Okay...

23:33.495 --> 23:35.038
-[Chris] What's wrong?
-I gotta... Uh...

23:35.122 --> 23:36.164
-Come on, man.
-I gotta...

23:36.248 --> 23:38.708
-I gotta return the camera we borrowed.
-Okay, come on.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.585
We could've hugged a little longer, bro.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.295
-[laughs] Come on.
-[door closes]

23:42.587 --> 23:43.713
[in Spanish] Sit down.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.758
-[in Spanish] I want to talk to you.
-[sighs heavily]

23:47.217 --> 23:48.301
Everything all right, Pop?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.804
[in Spanish, labored] Today was hard, son.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.097
[Casimiro exhales in relief]

23:53.056 --> 23:54.891
[Casimiro, in Spanish]
But we got through it.

23:55.016 --> 23:56.852
[chuckles] Yeah, we did.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.688
-[in Spanish] You did this.
-No!

23:59.813 --> 24:01.189
We all did, together.

24:04.276 --> 24:08.572
[in Spanish] I always hoped one of you
would step up and take over the taco shop.

24:11.241 --> 24:14.244
[in Spanish] Like a real partner
that I could rely on.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.373
[in Spanish] But that never happened...
[sighs]

24:21.710 --> 24:22.752
[in Spanish] Until today.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.922
[in Spanish] I know you want
to be a prestigious chef.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.759
[in Spanish] With everything.
But why not do all that here, son?

24:30.010 --> 24:31.136
[serene music plays]

24:32.179 --> 24:34.347
[in Spanish] You and Erik
worked together...

24:35.265 --> 24:36.475
really well.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.979
[in Spanish] Why not do that every day?

24:42.063 --> 24:45.400
[in Spanish] So I can sleep in
once in a while?

24:46.401 --> 24:47.861
[laughs] I don't...

24:48.236 --> 24:49.738
I don't know what to say, Pop.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.825
[in Spanish] Say yes.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.833
[in Spanish] Make this old man happy.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.838
[Chris sighs, sniffles]

25:11.468 --> 25:12.511
[Chris sighs]

25:16.723 --> 25:18.058
-[Chris exhales steadily]
-[sighs]

25:23.355 --> 25:26.566
Like, I don't understand.
How could you step to Pop like that?

25:26.650 --> 25:29.528
He asked me to come talk to him.
What was I supposed to do? Say no?

25:29.611 --> 25:31.404
It would've been better
than yelling at him!

25:31.488 --> 25:33.573
I wasn't yelling at him, Ana.

25:33.949 --> 25:37.577
[scoffs] I was trying to talk to him,
and then Thing 1 and Thing 2 jumped in

25:37.661 --> 25:39.663
and came at me
like I was being court-martialed.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.998
And then you joined the fucking battalion,

25:42.082 --> 25:45.752
and y'all treated me
like I'm some angry black girl? [laughs]

25:47.712 --> 25:48.713
Let's be real.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.466
Your family has never accepted me.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.678
-Yessika, that's just my mom--
-No, it is not!

25:54.761 --> 25:56.596
No, it's not!

25:56.846 --> 25:59.140
Erik has never been down for us!
And Chris?

25:59.224 --> 26:02.435
-He just got here, but he still doesn't--
-I don't care what my family thinks!

26:02.519 --> 26:03.645
Yes, you do. [scoffs]

26:04.271 --> 26:07.023
You're always putting them first.
You're always running to go help them.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.901
And when it's not them,
it's running to go do work for Tim.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.280
That's what this is all about.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.449
This is about Tim.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.034
And you not supporting the fact

26:18.118 --> 26:21.496
that I'm finally doing the shit
that I've dreamed about for years.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.249
I finally have someone
who believes in my work!

26:24.332 --> 26:25.917
I've always believed in your work.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.420
Yeah? But I'm finally getting paid.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.883
Your little white savior

26:33.967 --> 26:37.345
is tearing up our neighborhood
block by block.

26:37.887 --> 26:39.306
How many people in the homeless town

26:39.389 --> 26:41.975
were displaced
due to his beautifying projects? Hmm?

26:43.351 --> 26:47.272
Face it. You are part of the problem, Ana.

26:47.355 --> 26:49.232
And you can't separate the two.

26:49.941 --> 26:53.069
And if you think
he is just your benefactor,

26:53.153 --> 26:54.154
[yelling] girl, wake up!

26:55.196 --> 26:56.823
Homeboy is your pimp.

26:57.157 --> 27:00.702
You are just the latest flavor
of the month at his fucking paletería.

27:01.369 --> 27:05.123
And he's just gonna keep showing you off
until he wears you out

27:05.206 --> 27:08.209
and discovers a new little token
to claim as his latest find.

27:09.669 --> 27:15.175
Next week he'll have some gender-fluid,
one-eyed, albino Korean

27:15.258 --> 27:17.427
to showcase
in his traveling fucking circus.

27:19.596 --> 27:20.639
Fuck you.

27:22.557 --> 27:25.185
[sharp inhale] Fuck you! I'm done.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.687
[mellow music plays]

27:29.022 --> 27:30.398
-I been done.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.247
[distant chatter]

27:56.049 --> 27:57.550
Big day, huh?

28:01.096 --> 28:01.930
Sorta.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.684
Heard you're gonna be on the news.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.977
-I hope they get your good side.
-[clicks tongue]

28:08.061 --> 28:08.937
Shit.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.857
-They're all my good side.
-Oh, word? [laughs]

28:12.941 --> 28:13.775
You know.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.406
Your dad came by yesterday.

28:19.906 --> 28:20.990
Oh, God.

28:21.324 --> 28:24.452
He's having a hard time
since you accepted Stanford.

28:24.911 --> 28:27.789
You know my dad.
He loves to jump to conclusions.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.374
I mean, I haven't even said yes yet.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.211
But I want to.

28:36.047 --> 28:36.923
Of course.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.266
[both groaning]

28:46.349 --> 28:48.685
[laughs] I'm huge.

28:48.768 --> 28:50.437
-You are.
-[laughing]

28:51.396 --> 28:52.981
[birds chirping]

28:58.111 --> 28:58.945
I've been thinking.

29:00.822 --> 29:01.823
[distant yelling]

29:05.827 --> 29:08.663
[takes a deep breath] Come with me
to Stanford.

29:10.039 --> 29:11.791
[curious music plays]

29:13.209 --> 29:14.043
I...

29:16.254 --> 29:17.881
[Lidia] Ooh. [exhales]

29:18.757 --> 29:20.759
I think my water just broke. [pants]
