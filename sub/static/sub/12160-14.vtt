WEBVTT

00:02.453 --> 00:03.636
- Oh. Hey, look, Mandy.
- Huh?

00:03.671 --> 00:05.071
What a surprise.

00:05.089 --> 00:07.957
The parking citation people
are reaching out to us again.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.977
Okay, but, mama,
it totally wasn't my fault.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.278
Let me guess.
Was the meter maid jealous

00:12.312 --> 00:14.080
of your leather coat again?

00:14.098 --> 00:16.432
No. My tall boots.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.552
Look, you've been very
irresponsible with this car.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.387
One more strike,
and you lose it.

00:21.421 --> 00:22.263
Oh, come on. Everyone hates
on the pretty girl.

00:22.264 --> 00:23.106
Yeah.

00:23.140 --> 00:26.459
You two have no idea
how easy you've got it.

00:28.112 --> 00:30.279
Hey, honey, did we have
a party I was unaware of?

00:30.314 --> 00:31.314
No.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.132
That's weird.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.283
- What?
- Our trash cans were filled

00:34.318 --> 00:37.670
with wine bottles and what
I hope is onion dip.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.640
You think it's, uh,
you think it's the girls?

00:40.674 --> 00:41.641
No, baby.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.242
I think our kids like
corn liquor.

00:43.276 --> 00:46.295
Well...

00:46.330 --> 00:47.830
Joking aside,
I think you should give

00:47.881 --> 00:50.683
another one of those
drugs and alcohol talks anyway.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.468
It can't hurt.
Now why am I doing that?

00:52.503 --> 00:53.986
Well, because that's what
we decided...

00:54.021 --> 00:56.422
that, uh, you would be in charge
of the drugs and alcohol

00:56.456 --> 00:58.624
and I would be in charge
of the sex talk.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.626
That went well.

01:00.644 --> 01:04.797
Only one girl got pregnant
behind a bowling alley.

01:04.831 --> 01:08.768
Captioned by
closed captioning services, inc.

01:12.156 --> 01:14.040
Oh, hey, Michelle.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.274
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.609
I hope you don't mind
if I use your trash cans.

01:16.643 --> 01:17.994
I ran out of room in mine.

01:18.028 --> 01:20.780
Oh, no. Oh, so that's where
the onion dip came from.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.916
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.384
It, uh, looks like
you had a party.

01:25.419 --> 01:29.388
No, no. These are just
from a social gathering I had

01:29.423 --> 01:32.191
at my house with a bunch
of people.

01:32.226 --> 01:35.328
Well, you don't have to explain
yourself to me.

01:36.663 --> 01:39.432
Were the, uh,
were the Wongs invited?

01:39.466 --> 01:40.967
Yeah.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.635
- The Kanes?
- Yes.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.470
The Kopelmans?
Uh, you wouldn't have invited

01:44.505 --> 01:46.472
the Kopelmans
without inviting us.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.710
Uh...

01:52.513 --> 01:53.813
Dad, we've heard this speech.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.064
I know, and you're gonna
hear it again.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.816
Listen, I'm not gonna lie
to you.

01:56.850 --> 02:00.520
Drugs can make you feel
like you're on top of the world,

02:00.554 --> 02:03.523
like you can be the best
you can be and do anything,

02:03.557 --> 02:05.374
but... and here's
the big "but"...

02:05.409 --> 02:09.461
we have slipped
below the Kopelmans!

02:09.496 --> 02:13.082
All right, listen, the big "but"
here is that drugs can...

02:13.133 --> 02:16.502
I'm upset.
Could you follow me in here?

02:17.721 --> 02:19.972
I haven't got to the bad part
about the drugs yet,

02:20.007 --> 02:22.374
so you guys stay put,
and I'll back here in a minute

02:22.392 --> 02:26.679
with a really scary metaphor
about eggs fryin' in a pan.

02:29.716 --> 02:30.766
Honey, I haven't got
to the dangerous part

02:30.818 --> 02:32.618
about drugs yet.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.721
Michelle had a party,
and she didn't invite us.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.290
So we dodged a bullet.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.625
No. Wait.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.427
I have known Michelle
for years...

02:41.461 --> 02:42.778
- Right.
- And when Eve was born,

02:42.830 --> 02:44.947
I almost named her "Michelle,"
until I realized that

02:44.998 --> 02:47.066
that was the name
of your college girlfriend.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.969
Yeah, she... she was
a cheerleader.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.339
All right, stop.
You know what? Stop. Just...

02:58.579 --> 03:01.614
I mean, I just... I-I cannot
wrap my head around this.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.416
I mean, what... what could I
possibly have done

03:03.450 --> 03:04.634
to offend her?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.252
We were just at
her theme party last month...

03:06.270 --> 03:07.345
Yeah.

03:07.346 --> 03:08.421
And I... I thought that went great.
Remember?

03:08.455 --> 03:09.755
Yeah, I remember.

03:15.445 --> 03:19.765
Oh. Michelle.
This is your best party <i>ever.</i>

03:19.783 --> 03:21.600
Oh, I just love the '70s theme.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.152
Of course, I was just
a baby back then.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.104
Yeah, an eighth-grade baby.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.273
Wah, wah.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.275
Oh. Lava lamps are such
a nice touch...

03:29.293 --> 03:30.276
Yeah. Cool.
Right?

03:30.294 --> 03:32.111
Well, as one scientist
to another,

03:32.129 --> 03:34.347
I really try to have
an eye for detail.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.783
Ah. Well, I'm gonna go, uh,
check out the fondue bar.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.470
Michelle
Aren't you a weather girl?

03:41.505 --> 03:42.955
Meteorologist.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.957
<i>TV</i> meteorologist.
You just point at clouds

03:44.975 --> 03:46.842
that aren't really there.
"Look over here

03:46.894 --> 03:48.527
at the green..."

03:49.629 --> 03:51.597
Uh, actually,
my profession requires

03:51.631 --> 03:53.799
an extraordinary degree
of skill and knowledge.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.101
Um, I... I wasn't being
insulting.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.069
I was just... just, you know,
bustin' your chops,

03:57.104 --> 03:59.305
but isn't it funny that
your whole job

03:59.323 --> 04:01.474
you could download
on a free app?

04:01.508 --> 04:04.477
I mean, the whole...

04:05.846 --> 04:09.282
Oh, boy.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.452
Mystery to me.

04:15.455 --> 04:18.040
Well, I mean, I-I didn't
write her a thank-you note.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.041
Do you think that
could be it?

04:19.091 --> 04:20.559
- Oh, definitely.
- I-I...

04:20.594 --> 04:22.962
Pfft. Come on.
Write her a thank-you note.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.264
Baby, you're better
than that.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.004
Mm-hmm. I see.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.040
Wow. Okay.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.809
Hey. You need to move your car.
I'm gonna shoot some hoops.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.544
Okay. Here.
You move it. Here.

04:38.578 --> 04:39.979
- I'm 13. I'm not allowed.
- I'm in the middle

04:40.013 --> 04:42.114
of a very important conversation
right now, okay?

04:42.149 --> 04:45.251
Well, do you think that
Jeanette shaves her forearms?

04:45.285 --> 04:46.652
Give me the keys.

04:46.686 --> 04:47.920
I was thinking so, too,
because, to tell you the truth,

04:47.955 --> 04:49.588
you can see fuzz all the way
down to her elbows,

04:49.623 --> 04:51.857
and then it's, like,
nothing.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.592
- Mandy.
- Uh-huh.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.095
Mandy, you were supposed
to empty the dishwasher.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.999
You were supposed to go
to college. Oh!

05:00.033 --> 05:01.217
Did you just hear that?

05:01.251 --> 05:02.385
I was just totally funny.

05:02.419 --> 05:03.719
My sister walks in
and she's all,

05:03.754 --> 05:05.604
"um, Mandy, you were supposed
to empty the dishwasher,"

05:05.639 --> 05:06.889
and then I was like...
hey, hey, hey...

05:06.923 --> 05:09.425
"you were supposed to go
to college." Ow!

05:10.777 --> 05:12.094
I gotta call you back.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.747
How did this happen?

05:14.781 --> 05:15.931
How do you think
it happened?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.950
I'm 13. I've never driven
a car before.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.268
Oh, how hard can it be?

05:19.319 --> 05:23.022
YouTube is full of videos
of dogs driving tractors!

05:23.056 --> 05:24.590
Mom and dad are gonna
kill me.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.559
I've never been
in trouble before <i>ever.</i>

05:26.593 --> 05:28.728
I'm not like you people.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.230
You can take the hit
for this one,

05:31.264 --> 05:32.832
because I am one strike away
from public transportation.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.300
No. No. No, no, no.
You could...

05:34.334 --> 05:35.434
you could walk...

05:35.469 --> 05:37.269
Or... or you...
or you could ride your bike.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.374
I'm sorry.
Now I'm just being mean.

05:41.408 --> 05:42.741
You know what?

05:42.759 --> 05:44.577
This... this is your fault
for making me drive <i>your</i> car.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.212
It's your fault
for always exercising.

05:46.246 --> 05:48.547
This is America, Eve.
Kids don't do that.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.782
All right. That's enough.
Enough, okay?

05:49.816 --> 05:51.183
I have an idea. Come here.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.919
Look, Kyle has this device
that takes dents out of cars.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.788
He uses it, like, twice a day.

05:55.822 --> 05:58.824
His apartment's across
the street from a driving range.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.892
Hey, guys.

05:59.926 --> 06:01.394
What's with all the noise
out here?

06:01.428 --> 06:02.895
Um...

06:02.929 --> 06:04.563
We were just gonna...

06:04.598 --> 06:07.166
Clean the garage
as a surprise, daddy.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.969
Oh. Well,
use my power washer.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.271
Plug it in. You can get
the grease stains off the floor.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.206
Thanks.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.244
Even Cinderella didn't have
to power-wash the garage.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.451
Did I track something in?

06:26.619 --> 06:29.889
Just got off
the phone with Michelle.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.258
Did you know her entire job
could be done

06:32.292 --> 06:34.994
by a 99-cent phone app?

06:37.197 --> 06:40.232
Of course you did!

06:42.819 --> 06:46.372
Actually, I-I said it was
a free app,

06:46.406 --> 06:50.976
but that probably doesn't,
uh, help right now, does it?

06:50.994 --> 06:53.028
Why would you even say
something like that?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.547
Michelle is my friend.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.183
'Cause she's
an accuweather-ologist.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.169
She's wrong half the time,
but she still has a job.

07:00.203 --> 07:02.922
I just... it's the truth.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.256
All right. You know what?
Could...

07:04.291 --> 07:06.559
could you just make an effort
to not insult our friends?

07:06.593 --> 07:08.677
Well, at this age,
maybe we need less friends.

07:08.712 --> 07:10.930
We could thin the herd out
a little bit.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.398
You're thinning the people
that I like.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.400
I mean, Michelle and I...
we do fun things together.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.335
We go to the book groups
and the art fairs

07:16.353 --> 07:18.471
and... and that
soups of autumns class

07:18.505 --> 07:19.838
a-at the learning annex.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.575
Right. In my opinion, that was
a complete waste of $6.

07:22.609 --> 07:26.512
All right. You know what?
The girls are getting older,

07:26.546 --> 07:28.898
and if we don't maintain
our social life,

07:28.949 --> 07:31.584
we are staring down
the barrel

07:31.618 --> 07:36.355
of <i>decades</i>
of just you and me.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.909
And you wanna know
who I'm dragging

07:39.960 --> 07:42.228
to that
soups of autumn class?

07:43.296 --> 07:44.296
I'll be dead before then.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.866
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, you won't,

07:46.900 --> 07:51.837
because I will keep you alive
long enough to suffer through...

07:51.872 --> 07:53.772
All of it.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.549
You just threatened me
with life.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.152
Yes, I did!

08:16.282 --> 08:17.583
Mike, bad news.

08:17.617 --> 08:19.601
Curly's out for poker.

08:19.636 --> 08:21.236
Curly's never out
for poker.

08:21.271 --> 08:22.938
We set up
a table at his dad's wake.

08:22.972 --> 08:26.408
Mm. He joined
gamblers anonymous.

08:26.442 --> 08:27.743
What a wimp.

08:27.777 --> 08:29.111
Yeah, I know.

08:29.145 --> 08:32.080
A real man would just keep
trying to win it all back, huh?

08:32.114 --> 08:33.280
Wait a minute. Hold on.
I got a question for you.

08:33.299 --> 08:34.982
- Yeah. Yeah.
- When you were married...

08:35.018 --> 08:36.784
Oh, here we go.

08:36.803 --> 08:37.953
- Now listen...
- Yeah.

08:37.971 --> 08:40.304
If your wife was <i>not</i>
invited to a party...

08:40.340 --> 08:42.524
now wait a minute.
Which wife?

08:42.558 --> 08:43.958
I don't care. Lois. If she
wasn't invited to a party...

08:43.977 --> 08:46.144
Lois?
Well, Lois hated parties.

08:46.179 --> 08:47.529
All right, forget Lois. Ruth.

08:47.564 --> 08:48.814
If she wasn't invited
to a party...

08:48.848 --> 08:50.365
Ruth? Well, Ruth...
I didn't know she drank

08:50.400 --> 08:52.501
until I saw her sober.

08:54.170 --> 08:57.639
Let's just forget about
your wives for a minute.

08:57.674 --> 08:59.975
I might have insulted
one of Vanessa's friends,

08:59.993 --> 09:01.577
and now they're not
friends anymore,

09:01.611 --> 09:03.178
and Vanessa's
really worried that

09:03.213 --> 09:05.247
we're not gonna have any friends
and we're gonna end up alone,

09:05.281 --> 09:06.248
even though she's friends...

09:06.282 --> 09:08.016
With half of the women
in Denver.

09:08.051 --> 09:10.652
Mm. Mike, how many pairs
of shoes do you own?

09:10.687 --> 09:12.754
Uh, uh,
probably five or six,

09:12.789 --> 09:14.189
including the ones
I got on.

09:14.224 --> 09:15.190
And Vanessa?

09:15.225 --> 09:18.710
7 million.
What's the point?

09:18.761 --> 09:20.929
Well, yeah, see, women collect
friends like they collect shoes,

09:20.964 --> 09:22.598
and like shoes,
they never get rid of them,

09:22.632 --> 09:24.600
even if... even if the shoes
are going out of style.

09:24.634 --> 09:26.602
See, women are terrified that
the day they throw them away,

09:26.669 --> 09:28.437
that's the day
that they'll...

09:28.471 --> 09:30.072
that they'll desperately
need them.

09:30.106 --> 09:34.726
See, it's... it's...
It's a mental illness.

09:34.777 --> 09:36.178
I just wish you could
just take all the friends

09:36.212 --> 09:37.696
that don't fit anymore,
take 'em to goodwill

09:37.730 --> 09:39.948
and just,
like, give them away.

09:39.983 --> 09:43.685
"Hey, here. I hope somebody
can use the Kopelmans."

09:43.720 --> 09:46.288
Yeah, my father
used to say to me,

09:46.322 --> 09:47.289
"a man shouldn't have
more friends

09:47.323 --> 09:49.124
than he can name
in ten seconds."

09:49.158 --> 09:51.126
I like that,
but your dad also said,

09:51.160 --> 09:53.762
"don't date a woman
over 5'2"."

09:53.796 --> 09:57.198
Well, he was a short and lonely man.

09:57.216 --> 09:58.634
Hey, Mr. B.
You ready to do your vlog?

09:58.668 --> 10:00.836
Yeah, let's set the camera up
right over there.

10:00.870 --> 10:02.137
- Oh, ed.
- Hey. Hmm?

10:02.171 --> 10:03.705
Uh, what should I wear
to poker night?

10:03.740 --> 10:05.674
Wait a second.

10:05.708 --> 10:08.060
Kyle's coming to poker night?
You didn't ask me about that.

10:08.094 --> 10:10.045
Uh, well, I don't really
get the rules,

10:10.079 --> 10:14.249
but I am bringing beer and all
the money I got for my birthday.

10:14.284 --> 10:19.087
Well, you might want to wear
a shirt you don't mind losing.

10:24.594 --> 10:27.062
Hey.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.498
Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

10:29.532 --> 10:33.085
staring down the barrel
of somethin' genuine.

10:33.119 --> 10:35.904
This Saturday we're showing
genuine antiques at Outdoor Man,

10:35.938 --> 10:38.740
like this
single-shot colt peacemaker.

10:38.758 --> 10:40.342
It made peace the old-fashioned way...

10:40.376 --> 10:43.378
Hurled hot lead at other people
you didn't like.

10:43.413 --> 10:45.180
Okay, we've come a bit
since then,

10:45.214 --> 10:46.415
but still,
this is the genuine article.

10:46.449 --> 10:48.433
It is what it is.
I like that. Genuine.

10:48.468 --> 10:50.135
Too bad people can't be genuine.

10:50.186 --> 10:52.120
Truthful. That's what I like.
Truthful.

10:52.155 --> 10:54.089
We don't even have
genuine heroes anymore.

10:54.107 --> 10:57.626
Sports heroes... all 'roided up.
Hey, Tony.

10:57.660 --> 11:01.330
I've never seen anybody hit a ball 6 Miles before.

11:01.364 --> 11:04.599
What happened to your head?
It looks like a huge ash can.

11:04.634 --> 11:08.570
What's with all the man boobs?

11:08.604 --> 11:10.288
If you want
to see genuine articles,

11:10.323 --> 11:12.007
Outdoor Man this Saturday...

11:12.041 --> 11:13.975
our big genuine article sale.

11:14.010 --> 11:16.311
Pow.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.164
All right.
I want to finish up

11:19.215 --> 11:21.149
our discussion
about drugs and alcohol,

11:21.184 --> 11:24.302
so I want you guys to take
these two pamphlets.

11:24.337 --> 11:27.589
Read them. In the back,
there is a very simple test,

11:27.623 --> 11:30.926
unless... you're high.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.311
Dad, why do we have to read
this stuff?

11:33.346 --> 11:34.980
You already gave us
the talk.

11:35.014 --> 11:36.431
Yeah, drugs and alcohol
can make you feel like

11:36.466 --> 11:38.166
you're on top of the world.
Yeah.

11:38.201 --> 11:40.135
- Yeah.
- Like you can do anything.

11:40.153 --> 11:41.603
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:41.637 --> 11:44.639
But... and here
is the big "but"...

11:44.674 --> 11:47.409
- you have...
- Mike, can you come here a minute?

11:52.665 --> 11:54.082
- I was just about to get to the dangers...
- Hey.

11:54.117 --> 11:55.951
- Of drugs and alcohol.
- Yeah, listen, I talked to Michelle,

11:55.985 --> 11:57.519
- and I think that I have the whole thing worked out.
- I've got it worked out.

11:57.553 --> 11:58.920
- We're gonna go to...
- Listen, you know, you were totally right.

11:58.955 --> 12:00.522
I had no idea you had
this thing with shoes.

12:00.556 --> 12:03.008
You have a lot of shoes.
You can't throw shoes out.

12:03.042 --> 12:04.126
- I get it. I get it.
- What are you talking about?

12:04.160 --> 12:06.161
Listen, from now on,
when we go out,

12:06.195 --> 12:08.013
I'm just gonna keep
my opinions to myself...

12:08.047 --> 12:09.631
- Okay. All right. Well, good. Good.
- But it's too bad,

12:09.665 --> 12:11.066
'cause she's already written
you off as a friend,

12:11.100 --> 12:12.367
obviously, and I don't have a chance...
Well, no.

12:12.402 --> 12:13.969
- To make amends to her.
- No. Here. Wait. Listen.

12:14.003 --> 12:17.272
Apparently, her new boyfriend
is a big fan of yours,

12:17.306 --> 12:20.358
and he can't wait to meet
the real Outdoor Man.

12:20.393 --> 12:23.311
So if I'm reading you correctly,
I kind of saved the day.

12:23.345 --> 12:26.648
Yeah, after you ruined
the day.

12:26.682 --> 12:29.818
Yeah, but who remembers what
happened in the first quarter?

12:29.852 --> 12:32.788
All right,
so what is this gonna mean,

12:32.822 --> 12:33.955
a meal or something?

12:34.023 --> 12:35.123
Yep, the four of us

12:35.158 --> 12:37.159
at Michelle's favorite
raw food restaurant.

12:37.193 --> 12:38.794
Raw food?

12:38.828 --> 12:41.496
- Yeah. Why?
- Oh, that's like eating in the garden.

12:41.530 --> 12:43.465
You know, you gotta get
cooked food.

12:43.499 --> 12:45.500
That's what separates man
from the animal.

12:45.534 --> 12:48.203
Oh

12:48.237 --> 12:49.371
You know, I was in Thailand,

12:49.405 --> 12:50.672
and there's elephants there
that paint.

12:50.706 --> 12:51.723
- They have galleries.
- Wait.

12:51.757 --> 12:54.042
They're very famous
over there.

12:54.076 --> 12:55.177
Okay, well, you can
tell Michelle

12:55.211 --> 12:56.678
all about that at dinner.

12:56.712 --> 12:58.180
- Oh, Michelle from next door?
- Yeah.

12:58.214 --> 13:00.515
You know, her new boyfriend
is an ex-Navy S.E.A.L.

13:00.549 --> 13:01.516
How do you know that?

13:01.550 --> 13:03.101
I was at her party.

13:03.152 --> 13:04.986
Wh...

13:05.021 --> 13:07.405
Never mind. Never mind.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.391
- He's kinda hot.
- Yeah.

13:09.425 --> 13:11.293
I would totally go for him
if I didn't have a boyfriend

13:11.327 --> 13:13.662
and a baby from another man.

13:13.696 --> 13:16.114
Again,
kudos on the sex talk.

13:16.165 --> 13:18.066
Right.

13:20.970 --> 13:23.705
Mm. We might need something
stronger to get that dent out.

13:23.739 --> 13:24.940
This is
the most effective device

13:24.974 --> 13:27.108
for removing
car door panel dings.

13:27.143 --> 13:29.344
I was actually talking
about you.

13:29.378 --> 13:30.879
Mandy, he's trying to help.

13:30.913 --> 13:32.147
Just carry on, Kyle.

13:32.181 --> 13:34.516
All right.

13:34.550 --> 13:35.717
Yes!
Ohh.

13:35.751 --> 13:37.135
- It's perfect!
- Ohh!

13:37.186 --> 13:38.553
Yes. Yes!

13:38.587 --> 13:40.388
13 years, 16 weeks,
and 4 days

13:40.423 --> 13:42.023
of mom and dad
not getting mad at me.

13:42.058 --> 13:43.024
My record stands.

13:44.060 --> 13:45.560
Great.

13:49.432 --> 13:51.650
Yeah.

13:51.701 --> 13:53.401
That sometimes happens.

14:02.724 --> 14:04.758
I love kelp.

14:05.810 --> 14:07.394
Mmm. Oh, my God.

14:07.428 --> 14:08.595
The only thing that would
make it better is

14:08.613 --> 14:09.763
if it was a cheeseburger.

14:09.781 --> 14:12.533
And if these
were onion rings

14:12.567 --> 14:13.634
instead of beet chips.

14:14.936 --> 14:17.103
Oh, come on, you guys.
Be adventurous.

14:18.122 --> 14:19.105
Yeah.
Yeah, I've always wondered

14:19.123 --> 14:20.457
what it would be like
to be a rabbit

14:20.491 --> 14:24.011
running through the forest
with its mouth open.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.130
That's Outdoor Man talking.

14:27.165 --> 14:28.465
- That's right.
- Yeah.

14:28.499 --> 14:30.817
You know, Michelle, I am so glad
we could make this happen.

14:30.852 --> 14:32.085
- Me, too...
- Yeah.

14:32.119 --> 14:33.954
And I'm so happy
everyone's just...

14:33.972 --> 14:36.790
Trying.

14:36.824 --> 14:38.425
What do you mean by that?

14:38.459 --> 14:39.626
Honey, kelp...
put it in your mouth.

14:43.297 --> 14:45.148
Tom, I understand
you were a Navy S.E.A.L.

14:45.183 --> 14:46.183
Oh, he doesn't like
to talk about it.

14:46.234 --> 14:48.669
Hell, yeah, I was!

14:48.703 --> 14:50.237
Well, here's a toast...

14:50.271 --> 14:52.189
To the men
and women that keep us free.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.490
- Oh.
- And... and this is what?

14:53.524 --> 14:54.841
Cashew milk.

14:54.876 --> 14:56.276
Wow.

14:56.310 --> 14:58.478
<i>Semper fi.</i> Do or die.

14:59.781 --> 15:01.314
<i>Semper fi?</i>

15:01.332 --> 15:02.950
- Um, Vanessa...
- Uh...

15:02.984 --> 15:04.201
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna use the ladies' room. Wanna come with?

15:04.252 --> 15:05.202
- Of course. Yeah.
- Mm.

15:05.253 --> 15:06.286
- Yeah. Excuse us.
- All right, ladies. Good.

15:07.789 --> 15:10.424
Yes.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.125
Wow. It seems our menfolk
are really getting along...

15:12.159 --> 15:13.493
Yeah, yeah. Doesn't it?

15:13.511 --> 15:14.494
And Mike has changed.

15:14.512 --> 15:15.495
He's less...

15:15.530 --> 15:16.797
Um... cranky?

15:16.831 --> 15:17.798
I was gonna say "honest."

15:17.832 --> 15:19.683
Honest. Yeah, me, too.

15:19.717 --> 15:21.435
You know, I was mad
about his app comment...

15:21.469 --> 15:24.104
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'll let you in on a little secret.

15:24.138 --> 15:27.524
That's how
I get a lot of my information.

15:27.558 --> 15:29.810
But it's how
you present it.

15:29.844 --> 15:30.978
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:33.197 --> 15:35.949
On that final push to Baghdad,
I drove that M1

15:35.984 --> 15:38.351
18 hours straight
without stopping.

15:38.369 --> 15:40.921
Drove an M1
for 18 hours, huh?

15:40.955 --> 15:42.189
That's a long time.

15:42.223 --> 15:43.523
You're telling me.

15:43.558 --> 15:45.392
- Yeah.
- I lived it.

15:45.426 --> 15:48.462
Yeah. You know what

15:48.496 --> 15:49.529
I'm gonna call my daughters,
see if they're all right.

15:49.547 --> 15:50.664
Yeah. Sure.

15:50.698 --> 15:51.915
We should hang out
more often.

15:51.966 --> 15:53.200
- Yeah.
- Maybe something at the learning annex.

15:53.234 --> 15:55.218
Oh, you know what? They have
a new class on pickling.

15:55.253 --> 15:56.753
Did you know
that pickling is back?

15:56.804 --> 15:58.755
- I didn't, but it doesn't shock me.
- I... yeah.

15:58.806 --> 16:00.090
Hey, guys.

16:00.141 --> 16:01.575
- Yeah.
- Uh, could I talk to you privately for a minute?

16:01.609 --> 16:02.559
It'll just take a second.

16:02.593 --> 16:04.177
- Oh, of course. Uh-huh.
- Thanks.

16:04.211 --> 16:05.345
- Hey, uh...
- Yeah. Hey. Yeah.

16:05.379 --> 16:06.480
What's going on?

16:06.514 --> 16:08.515
Um, listen,
I think that guy's a liar.

16:08.549 --> 16:09.616
I don't think
he'S a Navy S.E.A.L.

16:09.651 --> 16:10.851
I think
he's just full of it.

16:10.885 --> 16:11.902
- He just told me he was...
- Ohh.

16:11.936 --> 16:14.271
In an M1A1 Abrams tank
for 18 hours.

16:14.322 --> 16:15.405
- It's impossible.
- Look. Come on. Come on.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.074
Maybe... maybe he drank
a lot of coffee.

16:17.108 --> 16:20.694
Maybe he peed in a jug.
We don't know. We weren't there.

16:20.728 --> 16:22.596
He wasn't there either.
The S. E.A.L.S... they...

16:22.630 --> 16:23.914
they don't drive
tanks around.

16:23.948 --> 16:25.282
- Even if they did... 18 hours?
- Okay.

16:25.333 --> 16:26.950
- It has a short fuel window.
- All right. Y...

16:27.001 --> 16:28.769
it would only be about four to six
hours top speed with... - uh, wh...

16:28.803 --> 16:31.421
why do you have to know
these things

16:31.456 --> 16:32.439
You know, it's against
the law what he's doing.

16:32.473 --> 16:34.041
- Oh, yeah.
- Stolen valor act.

16:34.075 --> 16:35.709
- Old red there could get six months in jail...
- Okay, but...

16:35.743 --> 16:36.960
- For doing that.
- Mike, listen. No, no. L...

16:37.011 --> 16:38.095
we talked about this.
You don't have to say

16:38.129 --> 16:40.130
- the truth all the time.
- So you're...

16:40.214 --> 16:41.615
- you don't. You don't, so... - you're
making me pick between wife and country?

16:41.649 --> 16:44.134
All right, so, look,
look...

16:44.185 --> 16:46.053
I will make it worth
your while. I...

16:46.087 --> 16:48.155
I will do the thing that
you're always asking me to do,

16:48.189 --> 16:51.625
but I won't do it because it
makes me physically sick.

16:54.162 --> 16:57.964
You will root for Michigan
over Ohio state?

16:57.999 --> 17:01.068
Yeah.

17:01.102 --> 17:03.236
I can't believe
mom and dad are gonna

17:03.271 --> 17:05.571
take you away from me...

17:05.606 --> 17:07.339
Just when I finally figured out
how to move the mirrors

17:07.375 --> 17:10.577
and what that little
red warning light was for.

17:10.611 --> 17:13.180
Hey, where's
dad's duffel bag?

17:13.214 --> 17:14.513
I don't know. Why?

17:14.549 --> 17:18.452
I'm gonna pack some stuff.
I think I'm moving on.

17:18.486 --> 17:20.654
Eve, what are you
talking about?

17:20.688 --> 17:23.423
I want mom and dad
to remember me how I was...

17:23.458 --> 17:27.794
innocent,
perfect, their final hope.

17:29.630 --> 17:32.432
I'm gonna head down South,
look for work.

17:32.467 --> 17:35.435
I'll be in touch
when I get settled.

17:35.470 --> 17:38.638
Gosh, I'm gonna
miss this place.

17:38.673 --> 17:40.474
Shut up.
You're not going anywhere.

17:40.508 --> 17:41.575
How do you know?

17:41.609 --> 17:42.576
Because you miss
one homework assignment,

17:42.610 --> 17:44.111
you break out in hives.

17:44.145 --> 17:46.780
Oh. Dad gave us homework.
We're supposed to read

17:46.814 --> 17:48.482
this drug literature.
Yeah, I wouldn't sweat it.

17:48.516 --> 17:50.784
It's mostly just cartoons
and a bunch of stickers.

17:51.986 --> 17:53.620
I just got a great idea.

17:54.689 --> 17:58.158
Sadness makes
my eyes sparkle.

17:59.327 --> 18:00.994
What?

18:02.330 --> 18:05.265
So there I was,

18:05.299 --> 18:07.467
limping through the streets
of Baghdad,

18:07.502 --> 18:09.402
dragging my wounded leg,

18:09.437 --> 18:11.905
sniper fire everywhere.

18:11.939 --> 18:13.557
We barely made it out
alive.

18:13.608 --> 18:15.008
Unbelievable.

18:15.042 --> 18:17.043
Yeah, she said it.

18:18.846 --> 18:20.647
Was the longest night
of my life.

18:20.681 --> 18:22.382
I know just what you mean.

18:22.416 --> 18:24.251
Then they got me on a bird

18:24.285 --> 18:26.086
and medevaced me out
of there at first light.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.721
Then I had four months

18:27.755 --> 18:29.656
of pretty intense physical therapy.
Mm.

18:29.690 --> 18:31.391
Yeah

18:31.425 --> 18:32.392
Doesn't matter. Leave it.

18:32.426 --> 18:34.594
Just leave it.
Oh, no. Let him talk.

18:34.629 --> 18:38.064
It was back at home base.
Fort Douglas.

18:38.099 --> 18:39.533
In Utah?

18:39.567 --> 18:40.934
You know, honey,
it's getting late.

18:40.968 --> 18:41.935
- We should, uh, we should get going.
- No, you know...

18:41.969 --> 18:42.936
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:42.970 --> 18:43.937
We got
plenty more war stories.

18:43.971 --> 18:45.672
We gotta honor
our soldiers, honey.

18:45.706 --> 18:48.942
No, Vanessa's right.
I gotta get up early tomorrow.

18:48.976 --> 18:50.760
Well, I guess we'll see
you two at the party.

18:50.812 --> 18:51.945
Tom, no.

18:51.979 --> 18:53.446
There... there's a party?

18:53.481 --> 18:55.515
Great.
What, uh, what can we bring?

18:55.549 --> 18:59.119
Oh, yeah.
It's not really a party.

18:59.153 --> 19:01.021
Uh, it's just
a few close friends.

19:01.055 --> 19:02.189
Will the Wongs be there?

19:02.223 --> 19:03.623
- Uh...
- The Kanes?

19:03.658 --> 19:04.891
- Uh...
- The Kopelmans?

19:04.926 --> 19:06.526
Uh...
Seriously?

19:06.561 --> 19:08.862
But...
I don't understand.

19:08.896 --> 19:10.630
May I speak freely?
Please.

19:10.665 --> 19:12.566
The Kopelmans
don't like you.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.468
So... pssh, don't invite
the Kopelmans...

19:15.503 --> 19:17.170
Right?

19:17.205 --> 19:18.638
It's complicated.

19:18.673 --> 19:21.041
We're very close with them.

19:21.075 --> 19:24.578
I guess
it's not that complicated.

19:24.612 --> 19:28.465
I see. I see. Uh, well,
no, I-I understand.

19:28.516 --> 19:29.583
Yeah.

19:29.617 --> 19:31.051
Just, uh, no hard feelings.

19:31.085 --> 19:32.052
No.

19:33.955 --> 19:37.257
Mike... do it.

19:40.645 --> 19:42.762
You're not a Navy S.E.A.L.

19:42.797 --> 19:44.264
Ohh.

19:44.282 --> 19:47.601
That is the first full breath
I've had all night.

19:47.635 --> 19:49.602
Not a Navy S.E.A.L.? Of course he is.
No. Not a Navy S.E.A.L.

19:49.620 --> 19:50.820
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

19:50.872 --> 19:51.905
You don't know what
you're talking about.

19:51.939 --> 19:53.773
Fort Douglas...
that's an army base.

19:53.791 --> 19:55.275
It was closed 20 years ago.

19:55.309 --> 19:56.776
<i>Semper fi...</i>
that's from the marine corps,

19:56.811 --> 19:57.961
as I recall.

19:57.995 --> 20:00.113
M1 tank doesn't have
an 18-hour range.

20:00.131 --> 20:01.631
You don't know anything
about what you're talking...

20:01.666 --> 20:04.217
plus I don't think the S.E.A.L.s
use self-Tanner, do they?

20:04.252 --> 20:05.518
Night, folks.

20:05.553 --> 20:07.787
Come on.

20:07.822 --> 20:09.506
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

20:09.557 --> 20:11.791
And she gets
all her weather information

20:11.826 --> 20:13.960
from a free phone app.

20:13.978 --> 20:16.463
It's true.

20:20.668 --> 20:22.836
I cannot believe
I said that to her.

20:22.870 --> 20:25.605
I mean, that could ruin
her career. Just...

20:25.640 --> 20:26.606
But it felt good.

20:26.641 --> 20:29.309
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

20:29.327 --> 20:33.313
It really did. Yeah. Oh.

20:33.347 --> 20:34.647
You know, I-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

20:34.665 --> 20:36.182
I know I'm supposed
to be the civilized part

20:36.217 --> 20:38.485
of this couple.

20:38.519 --> 20:39.986
- You don't need to apologize for being...
- I just...

20:40.004 --> 20:42.188
More like me.

20:42.223 --> 20:43.990
You know, honey,

20:44.025 --> 20:46.159
we are gonna grow old
alone together,

20:46.193 --> 20:47.827
just you and I.

20:47.862 --> 20:49.462
Promise?

20:49.497 --> 20:50.463
Yeah.

20:50.497 --> 20:52.732
- Mm.
- Ohh.

20:52.767 --> 20:54.000
- I gotta eat somethin' cooked.
- Mm.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.936
I swear I do.

21:02.026 --> 21:05.629
Wow. Look at that.

21:07.865 --> 21:08.998
Interesting.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.101
Yeah. Oh, Mike,
we've got some good girls.

21:11.135 --> 21:12.469
Yeah,
we've got some good girls.

21:12.503 --> 21:14.204
Yeah. They're just...
they're gonna grow up,

21:14.238 --> 21:15.772
go out in the world,
and do just fine.

21:15.807 --> 21:17.140
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:17.175 --> 21:21.311
I think they pulled a dent out
and the paint popped off.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.647
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that makes more sense.

21:23.681 --> 21:24.715
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

21:24.749 --> 21:26.249
Ohh. What should we do
about it?

21:26.284 --> 21:27.650
Nothing.

21:27.668 --> 21:30.253
Mandy's got to drive to school
with this sign on there.

21:30.288 --> 21:32.456
That's punishment enough.
