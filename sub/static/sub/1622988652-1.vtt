WEBVTT

00:11.276 --> 00:14.277
Every town is built
on bad decisions.

00:16.314 --> 00:21.119
And I built this town
brick by brick.

00:21.154 --> 00:24.056
If it weren't for me the Old
Port would be in the gutter

00:24.091 --> 00:26.652
or belong to the North End.

00:26.687 --> 00:29.193
Not that I'm afraid
of the North End.

00:30.361 --> 00:32.229
But this town...

00:32.264 --> 00:33.824
belongs to me.

00:33.859 --> 00:36.794
It's mine.

00:36.829 --> 00:41.601
Guess you can say
I'm a big fish in a small pond.

00:41.636 --> 00:44.571
But there's always
a bigger fish.

01:06.727 --> 01:08.232
Bobby!

01:08.267 --> 01:09.596
You check the hog ring
on that?

01:09.631 --> 01:11.136
Yeah.

01:11.171 --> 01:12.368
You sure?

01:12.403 --> 01:14.634
Hog ring looks fine, George.

01:14.669 --> 01:16.372
All right.

01:40.794 --> 01:42.398
China white.

01:45.766 --> 01:47.370
Hey Pop?

01:53.279 --> 01:54.707
Chuck it.

02:02.618 --> 02:06.884
We never saw that though.

02:06.919 --> 02:10.558
I mean it, Marty,
keep your mouth shut.

02:10.593 --> 02:12.296
You don't have to tell me,
skipper.

02:44.858 --> 02:47.826
-Thanks Darlene.
-Mhm.

02:51.403 --> 02:52.600
Mhm.

02:52.635 --> 02:55.669
Pats by six and a half.

02:55.704 --> 02:57.374
Keep chasing it, Pop.

02:57.409 --> 02:58.540
You're not gonna believe
what we pulled up

02:58.575 --> 03:00.641
in the trap today.

03:00.676 --> 03:05.217
Some real Miami Vice shit.

03:08.651 --> 03:10.981
Your takeout's ready, Emma.

03:12.919 --> 03:14.655
Thanks Darlene.

03:21.026 --> 03:25.633
You look like
you just saw a ghost.

03:25.668 --> 03:27.635
You'll be all right?

03:27.670 --> 03:31.309
Yeah.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.872
Darlene.

03:33.907 --> 03:35.445
It's icy.

03:37.977 --> 03:41.583
All right.

03:41.618 --> 03:43.354
I got it, I got it, I got it.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.685
I got it.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.885
Tommy, watching you guys
makes me really

03:46.920 --> 03:48.491
want to have a kid.

03:48.526 --> 03:49.756
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:49.791 --> 03:54.959
Get in, get in.

03:54.994 --> 03:57.027
Ugh.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.535
There you go.

03:59.570 --> 04:02.967
Your mother, I miss her.

04:03.002 --> 04:03.935
I know you do.

04:03.970 --> 04:05.904
I love you guys.

04:11.813 --> 04:14.517
On your side, Pop, on your side.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.920
Fuck.

04:59.025 --> 05:00.959
I leave tomorrow morning.

05:06.065 --> 05:08.571
Feels like summer
gets shorter and shorter.

05:14.777 --> 05:15.941
Hey.

05:15.976 --> 05:17.580
Now I gotta go in the water.

05:17.615 --> 05:18.779
Go.

05:18.814 --> 05:20.418
Don't dare me, I will.

05:20.453 --> 05:21.848
The water's not that bad.

05:21.883 --> 05:23.982
Fine.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.991
When are you gonna
stop knocking on my door?

06:39.026 --> 06:40.157
You should lock it.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.566
Psh, I've been here 40 years.

06:42.601 --> 06:43.798
Never locked my door.

06:43.833 --> 06:46.130
Forty years. Did you eat?

06:46.165 --> 06:47.637
No I'm good.

06:47.672 --> 06:49.100
Do me a favor, give him this.

06:49.135 --> 06:51.476
Makes sure he drinks it.

06:51.511 --> 06:54.072
Okay.

06:54.107 --> 06:57.713
I hope you're not bringing me
fucking carrot juice.

06:57.748 --> 07:00.716
Ugh, she's got you
doing it too now.

07:00.751 --> 07:02.080
You're lucky to have her.

07:02.115 --> 07:03.950
I wouldn't put up
with your shit.

07:03.985 --> 07:06.722
You came over here solely
to break my balls?

07:06.757 --> 07:08.757
My dad's payment this week.

07:13.192 --> 07:14.598
-That coming from you?
-Yeah,

07:14.633 --> 07:16.193
it's just so he can stay ahead.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.536
He's chasing it today.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.098
He's not making up any ground.

07:20.133 --> 07:21.605
He keeps on gambling.

07:21.640 --> 07:25.939
You should stop
paying his debts.

07:31.144 --> 07:34.046
You're still young, Tommy.

07:34.081 --> 07:36.950
I don't know of if you'd ever
been a great fighter.

07:36.985 --> 07:42.725
But I know you'd make
a good soldier.

07:42.760 --> 07:49.160
Sometimes a man's gotta do
what he doesn't want to do.

07:49.195 --> 07:51.261
Drink your carrot juice.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.901
Ugh, you and Marie.

07:53.936 --> 07:56.904
What am I? A fucking rabbit.

08:29.741 --> 08:33.072
Oh shit. I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! Are you--

08:37.584 --> 08:40.310
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:40.345 --> 08:43.049
-Fuck are you okay?
-Yeah.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.219
It's been a while.

08:48.254 --> 08:51.288
Yeah, yeah it has.

08:53.765 --> 08:55.666
-How you've been?
-Good thanks.

08:55.701 --> 09:01.265
-Last time I saw you was--
-Seven years ago.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.069
How's your mom?

09:03.104 --> 09:04.235
She's sick.

09:04.270 --> 09:06.776
I came back to look after her.

09:06.811 --> 09:09.042
I'm sorry.

09:09.077 --> 09:12.848
That she's sick,
not that you came back.

09:12.883 --> 09:15.048
You look good, you look
like you're doing well.

09:15.083 --> 09:17.820
Look at this freaking car.

09:22.321 --> 09:26.763
It was good seeing you.

09:26.798 --> 09:28.732
Hey, do you want to come in?

09:28.767 --> 09:31.064
I've got groceries in the truck
if you want to help me.

09:31.099 --> 09:35.607
-Um.
-You'd save me a trip.

09:40.779 --> 09:42.108
Sorry about the mess.

09:42.143 --> 09:46.948
Oh no, it's fine.

09:46.983 --> 09:49.082
How's your dad?

09:49.117 --> 09:51.689
Still drinking like a fish.

09:51.724 --> 09:54.285
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:57.224 --> 10:01.963
Emma?

10:01.998 --> 10:05.901
Here, Mom.

10:05.936 --> 10:09.234
Mom.

10:09.269 --> 10:14.041
Oh, Mikey.

10:14.076 --> 10:15.878
Mom, this is Tommy.

10:15.913 --> 10:19.013
You remember Tommy, Tommy.

10:19.048 --> 10:22.786
Tommy.

10:22.821 --> 10:24.986
Where's Mikey?

10:25.021 --> 10:28.286
You boys playing in the yard?

10:28.321 --> 10:30.420
Mikey's dead, Mom.

10:33.898 --> 10:36.899
Right.

10:36.934 --> 10:40.100
Of course.

10:40.135 --> 10:43.774
You look good, Mrs. Maddox.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.842
I can make you something, Tommy.

10:45.877 --> 10:48.944
No, no, no,
I just came in to say hi.

11:04.962 --> 11:06.192
I think I'm gonna go.

11:06.227 --> 11:09.096
Hm? Oh yeah,
you're probably busy.

11:09.131 --> 11:13.001
-Can I get out that door?
-Yeah, of course.

11:13.036 --> 11:18.809
Patty, it was good seeing you.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.404
Bye.

11:25.213 --> 11:27.345
Aint in your
fucking cards, all right.

11:27.380 --> 11:29.853
-Jesus.
-What are you looking at?

11:29.888 --> 11:31.283
Just cause you buy a
poker table doesn't mean

11:31.318 --> 11:33.021
you know how to play poker.

11:33.056 --> 11:35.155
-Pop it out.
-You ain't gonna go in?

11:35.190 --> 11:37.058
I'm out.

11:37.093 --> 11:41.194
-It's me and you, boss.
-Okay.

11:41.229 --> 11:44.065
Whoa, jeez.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.001
Under the gun.

11:51.778 --> 11:54.405
All right,
it doesn't go around this way.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.781
Deal me out of the next game.

12:02.085 --> 12:04.756
-You win?
-Of course I'm winning.

12:04.791 --> 12:08.155
-You cheating?
-Call it house rules.

12:08.190 --> 12:11.356
Thank you, Darlene.

12:11.391 --> 12:12.995
Shot?

12:13.030 --> 12:14.733
I'm good.

12:20.202 --> 12:22.103
Here.

12:22.138 --> 12:23.302
What's this?

12:23.337 --> 12:25.436
Three hundred for my brother.

12:25.471 --> 12:27.141
What are you fucking kidding me?

12:27.176 --> 12:29.308
How is he making these payments?

12:29.343 --> 12:31.849
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

12:31.884 --> 12:34.412
I don't know.

12:34.447 --> 12:36.480
Well am I going to have to lean
on him and find out?

12:36.515 --> 12:39.417
No, it's just a matter of time.

12:39.452 --> 12:43.388
He'll be gambling all season.

12:43.423 --> 12:45.929
Matter of time, huh.

12:45.964 --> 12:47.194
You told me it wasn't going to
be--

12:47.229 --> 12:51.330
I know what I told you,
trust me all right.

12:51.365 --> 12:53.002
What else you got?

12:53.037 --> 12:54.300
Been asking around.

12:54.335 --> 12:56.236
Carly, works over on Federal.

12:56.271 --> 12:59.305
She's been pushing H.

12:59.340 --> 13:03.276
-Is that it?
-Yeah.

13:03.311 --> 13:07.181
You figure it the fuck out
with your brother, all right?

13:07.216 --> 13:10.019
All right.

13:10.054 --> 13:11.020
Good luck.

13:11.055 --> 13:14.155
Don't need luck.

13:25.135 --> 13:27.465
It's a cold case.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.566
The department conducted
an investigation.

13:29.601 --> 13:33.405
No eyewitnesses
could identify a suspect.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.848
You really want to see this?

13:36.883 --> 13:39.378
Yes.

13:59.664 --> 14:04.271
There was an altercation
between several young men.

14:04.306 --> 14:07.142
Got violent.

14:07.177 --> 14:09.540
Michael was stabbed fives times.

14:09.575 --> 14:11.278
That's all we could gather.

14:11.313 --> 14:14.215
Yeah, right.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.448
I'm sorry, Ms. Maddox.

14:16.483 --> 14:19.055
Wait, that's it?

14:19.090 --> 14:22.553
That's everything?

14:22.588 --> 14:26.623
There was zero cooperation
from the community.

14:26.658 --> 14:30.968
At the time, your own mother
wouldn't talk.

14:31.003 --> 14:32.596
Look, if you hear anything
while you're in town

14:32.631 --> 14:36.336
you let me know.

14:36.371 --> 14:39.603
I'm on your side, Emma.

14:39.638 --> 14:44.476
If you don't mind me asking,
why now?

14:44.511 --> 14:47.281
After seven years.

14:47.316 --> 14:49.646
I guess I need some closure.

14:54.257 --> 14:58.996
In my experience,
there's no such thing.

15:01.231 --> 15:03.396
I think it'd be good for yah,
take her on a date.

15:03.431 --> 15:04.628
My best friend's sister.

15:04.663 --> 15:06.531
To her to O'Malley's.

15:06.566 --> 15:08.500
I'm not taking her
to fucking O'Malley's, Marty.

15:08.535 --> 15:11.668
You get dollar oysters,
two dollar pints, come on.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.011
Nothing's more romantic
than two dollar pints.

15:14.046 --> 15:16.640
You don't need to roll out
the red carpet for an old fling.

15:16.675 --> 15:19.346
She was never an old fling.

15:19.381 --> 15:23.152
What? You never groping for
trout in her peculiar river.

15:23.187 --> 15:24.549
Did I ever what?

15:24.584 --> 15:26.089
What? That's--that's
Shakespeare.

15:26.124 --> 15:28.058
Groping for trout,
that's Shakespeare.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.028
Okay, no she's probably
not even interested.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.327
There's too much history there,
you know.

15:33.362 --> 15:38.970
Too much pain.

15:39.005 --> 15:42.534
This the Maddox girl?

15:42.569 --> 15:44.437
Yeah.

15:44.472 --> 15:46.703
Be careful.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.442
He's a big boy, George,
he'll be all right.

15:49.477 --> 15:53.611
Big boys get in big trouble.

15:56.715 --> 15:58.583
Come on.

16:00.158 --> 16:03.093
Ugh!

16:03.128 --> 16:05.590
Piece of shit.

16:05.625 --> 16:11.596
Need a jump?

16:11.631 --> 16:16.172
You guys sure do love
to eat over there, huh?

16:16.207 --> 16:20.671
Yeah, it's diapers.

16:20.706 --> 16:23.311
Sorry.

16:23.346 --> 16:26.380
You want a jump or not?

16:26.415 --> 16:28.250
Okay.

16:28.285 --> 16:30.120
I'm parked over there,
I'll pull my car around.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.781
All right.

16:31.816 --> 16:35.290
Uh, could you try not
to hit me with it this time?

16:35.325 --> 16:39.063
Please.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.461
-I got it, dude--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

16:41.496 --> 16:43.100
I got it, dude, okay.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.662
Oh tough guy, huh?

16:44.697 --> 16:46.796
-That's the wrong one.
-Yup, I know, uh-huh.

16:46.831 --> 16:50.470
Just making sure--making sure
you know what you're doing.

16:50.505 --> 16:53.110
Oh, see? There you go, huh.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.343
-Give it.
-All right!

16:55.378 --> 16:58.082
Ow, just hit my head
on the hood.

16:58.117 --> 17:01.316
-Put it on right?
-Yah, go for it, dude, yeah.

17:12.857 --> 17:14.791
Is your dad gonna be all right?

17:14.826 --> 17:17.398
Oh uh, yeah probably not.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.306
How about you?

17:24.341 --> 17:27.474
How you doing
since you've been back?

17:33.482 --> 17:35.779
-It's cold.
-Hey, you want to get dinner

17:35.814 --> 17:38.617
with me, I'd like to catch up.

17:38.652 --> 17:41.521
I think it'd be nice.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.524
Wow, tough choice, I got it.

17:44.559 --> 17:46.262
No it's not a tough choice.

17:46.297 --> 17:49.793
Um...

17:49.828 --> 17:51.267
The suspense is killing me.

17:51.302 --> 17:55.766
Let's get dinner, let's do it.

17:55.801 --> 17:59.638
Okay, well I hesitate
to ask you to pick the place.

17:59.673 --> 18:01.739
You don't stop.

18:01.774 --> 18:05.149
-Thanks.
-Yeah, of course.

18:05.184 --> 18:08.284
See yah.

18:08.319 --> 18:12.123
Get this truck looked at,
it's embarrassing.

18:37.678 --> 18:40.415
Carly on Federal is dealing H.

18:44.388 --> 18:47.290
All right.

18:47.325 --> 18:49.259
We playing cards or what?

18:54.332 --> 18:59.236
Hi Mom.

18:59.271 --> 19:04.604
I saw Tommy today, he says hi.

19:04.639 --> 19:06.870
Sweetheart,
why don't you run upstairs

19:06.905 --> 19:08.773
and ask your father and brother

19:08.808 --> 19:10.874
what they want for supper.

19:27.662 --> 19:32.830
Watch, I know exactly
what I'm doing, okay.

19:32.865 --> 19:34.898
-Fuck.
-Take your blindfold off, Em.

19:34.933 --> 19:37.274
The problem is is you're
freaking chucking it.

19:37.309 --> 19:40.574
All right,
you just gotta ease it soft.

19:40.609 --> 19:41.707
I know that's hard for you.

19:41.742 --> 19:42.906
I know how to be soft.

19:42.941 --> 19:45.777
Lay it up there.

19:45.812 --> 19:49.583
-I got this.
-Okay.

19:55.888 --> 19:59.395
-Soft.
-Soft, I heard you.

19:59.430 --> 20:01.430
And.

20:01.465 --> 20:03.399
Oh! Did you see that?

20:03.434 --> 20:06.270
Wow, you actually did it.

20:06.305 --> 20:07.898
Come on Emma,
we gotta meet the boys.

20:07.933 --> 20:09.636
You're with the boys.

20:09.671 --> 20:10.769
Yeah, you wish, Mikey.

20:10.804 --> 20:13.673
Oh come...

20:13.708 --> 20:14.443
-Bye.
-Bye.

20:14.478 --> 20:18.909
Bye.

20:18.944 --> 20:20.878
I don't like her hanging out
with that girl.

20:20.913 --> 20:22.847
Yeah, I know you don't.

20:26.721 --> 20:28.358
What?

20:28.393 --> 20:29.986
Don't play dumb, you know what.

20:33.794 --> 20:35.728
My sister.

20:35.763 --> 20:39.435
Your sister what?

20:58.082 --> 21:04.823
-Hey sweetheart.
-Brennan.

21:04.858 --> 21:10.961
-You're free?
-I got a nine o'clock.

21:10.996 --> 21:12.699
Well, you've got 15 minutes.

21:12.734 --> 21:14.866
What?
That's all it's gonna take?

21:14.901 --> 21:17.770
Fourteen minutes is all I need.

21:36.362 --> 21:41.398
If I check inside your purse
what am I going to find?

21:41.433 --> 21:44.896
It's okay, it's okay.

21:44.931 --> 21:47.404
You can say it.

21:47.439 --> 21:48.933
You've been pushing H.

21:53.577 --> 21:55.808
Say it.

21:55.843 --> 21:58.745
I've been pushing H.

21:58.780 --> 22:01.011
Okay.

22:01.046 --> 22:07.721
I'll kick up to Kerrigan
I just really needed a little--

22:07.756 --> 22:11.989
You're gonna kick up to me,
okay.

22:12.024 --> 22:13.991
Okay.

22:14.026 --> 22:16.499
And it's just between us.

22:16.534 --> 22:18.633
Even better.

22:18.668 --> 22:21.735
What?

22:21.770 --> 22:23.968
N--nothing.

22:27.644 --> 22:29.875
-Why is that better for you?
-It's fine, it's good.

22:29.910 --> 22:32.449
You don't just say
it's better for you.

22:32.484 --> 22:33.945
-I don't know.
-You don't think I wouldn't

22:33.980 --> 22:37.553
slice your fucking throat.

22:59.038 --> 23:01.137
So no lobster rolls for you?

23:01.172 --> 23:04.107
No, I don't even want
to look at another lobster.

23:04.142 --> 23:05.878
I just can't.

23:05.913 --> 23:08.551
How long you've
been on that boat?

23:08.586 --> 23:10.047
Six years.

23:10.082 --> 23:12.588
You like it?

23:12.623 --> 23:13.919
Yeah, yeah.

23:13.954 --> 23:15.756
I get to look out for my dad.

23:15.791 --> 23:17.527
Keep an eye on him.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.156
Mhm.

23:20.191 --> 23:21.762
What about you?

23:21.797 --> 23:23.126
What do you do now?

23:23.161 --> 23:24.534
Me?

23:24.569 --> 23:27.801
I am a business consultant.

23:27.836 --> 23:29.935
A business consultant.

23:29.970 --> 23:31.607
Wow.

23:31.642 --> 23:33.873
Could you--could you consult me?

23:33.908 --> 23:36.073
No, there's no hope for me.

23:36.108 --> 23:38.680
You're way past consulting.

23:38.715 --> 23:40.814
I believe it.

23:40.849 --> 23:46.853
Yeah.

23:46.888 --> 23:48.492
You still train?

23:48.527 --> 23:49.889
Me? No, no, no.

23:49.924 --> 23:52.628
Um...

23:52.663 --> 23:57.699
I haven't stepped foot
into a gym since uh...

23:57.734 --> 24:00.801
it's been a while.

24:00.836 --> 24:03.969
-Well, that's good.
-Yeah.

24:04.004 --> 24:06.510
You know, I used to hate
watching you fight.

24:06.545 --> 24:08.039
You'd snap and you'd just be

24:08.074 --> 24:12.681
this completely
different person.

24:12.716 --> 24:15.145
You were good though.

24:15.180 --> 24:19.820
No, I really wasn't that good.

24:19.855 --> 24:22.691
Oh that's what it is.

24:22.726 --> 24:24.957
What?

24:24.992 --> 24:26.024
What's different about you.

24:26.059 --> 24:30.534
You're humble.

24:30.569 --> 24:33.933
Yeah.

24:33.968 --> 24:37.233
Life will do that to you, right.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.004
Yeah.

24:39.039 --> 24:42.238
It will.

24:42.273 --> 24:44.878
The night my brother...

24:44.913 --> 24:47.111
the night that he died

24:47.146 --> 24:49.047
nobody saw anything?

24:56.925 --> 25:00.091
Um, it just...

25:00.126 --> 25:03.732
it all happened so fast, Emma.

25:03.767 --> 25:05.701
I shouldn't have brought it up.

25:05.736 --> 25:07.065
-No, it's fine.
-No, I'm sorry.

25:07.100 --> 25:10.970
You don't have to apologize,
okay.

25:14.943 --> 25:16.910
Emma...

25:16.945 --> 25:25.787
I wouldn't go around
asking questions like that.

25:25.822 --> 25:28.218
Around here.

25:39.363 --> 25:42.232
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

25:52.112 --> 25:53.914
You know, I don't want you
to think I asked you out

25:53.949 --> 25:56.950
just because I wanted to
learn about my brother.

25:56.985 --> 26:01.757
Yeah, I know you didn't.

26:01.792 --> 26:04.793
You know,
I keep having this dream.

26:04.828 --> 26:08.093
This recurring nightmare where
I have a chance to save him

26:08.128 --> 26:13.296
and I'm just always too late.

26:13.331 --> 26:19.874
Yeah, I understand.

26:19.909 --> 26:22.943
I always thought you'd
come back after the funeral.

26:22.978 --> 26:26.111
I guess I just wished
you'd come back after the--

26:26.146 --> 26:29.785
I wanted to.

26:29.820 --> 26:32.623
I just couldn't do it.

26:37.289 --> 26:40.763
I am though really glad
I got to see you tonight.

26:40.798 --> 26:42.094
Me too.

26:46.672 --> 26:48.804
It's been too long.

26:48.839 --> 26:50.707
Yeah, it has.

27:14.260 --> 27:15.732
Do you remember
what we said to each other

27:15.767 --> 27:18.295
when we were kids?

27:18.330 --> 27:19.901
I mean, we said a lot
of things to each other

27:19.936 --> 27:21.672
-when we were kids.
-Yeah.

27:21.707 --> 27:25.368
But do you remember
what we said?

27:25.403 --> 27:28.404
Yeah, I do.

27:28.439 --> 27:31.110
You didn't forget?

27:31.145 --> 27:34.685
No, never.

27:36.722 --> 27:38.051
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

27:38.086 --> 27:41.791
-Bye.
-Bye.

28:03.441 --> 28:05.408
Her name's Emma Maddox.

28:05.443 --> 28:09.280
She was in the station
the other day asking questions.

28:09.315 --> 28:13.856
About her dead brother Mikey.

28:13.891 --> 28:17.057
Okay.

28:17.092 --> 28:20.027
What's that to me?

28:20.062 --> 28:24.163
I don't know, what's it to yah?

28:34.208 --> 28:37.176
I appreciate you, Charlie.

28:37.211 --> 28:43.281
And about my cousin's problem.

28:43.316 --> 28:47.054
I'll look into it.

28:47.089 --> 28:50.893
-Thank you.
-Good seeing yah.

28:57.803 --> 29:01.772
I say we kill the bitch.

29:01.807 --> 29:03.499
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

29:03.534 --> 29:05.501
-She's asking about--
-You can't go around

29:05.536 --> 29:09.406
just killing everybody
that gives you problems.

29:09.441 --> 29:13.344
We bleed people dry.

29:13.379 --> 29:16.182
You can sheer a sheep
many times.

29:16.217 --> 29:18.052
All right.

29:18.087 --> 29:22.353
But you can only skin it once.

29:22.388 --> 29:25.829
Our economy
is predicated on fear.

29:25.864 --> 29:30.097
The possibility of death.

29:30.132 --> 29:33.364
Not death.

29:38.008 --> 29:40.811
Your dad's Bill Belichick,
I'm Tom Brady

29:40.846 --> 29:41.878
-and you're Edelman.
-Whoa, whoa,

29:41.913 --> 29:43.440
why do you get to be Tommy?

29:43.475 --> 29:45.178
There's nothing wrong
with being Julian Edelman.

29:45.213 --> 29:46.509
I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with being

29:46.544 --> 29:49.380
Julian Edelman
but I mean you know,

29:49.415 --> 29:51.118
I'm like the franchise guy.

29:51.153 --> 29:54.220
No, I'm the Tom Brady
of catching lobster.

29:54.255 --> 29:56.387
-Everyone knows that.
-You're the fucking Bledsoe

29:56.422 --> 29:58.158
of catching lobster,
by the way.

29:58.193 --> 30:01.161
Oh! That's a low blow there.

30:01.196 --> 30:02.866
How'd the date go?

30:02.901 --> 30:04.527
-It was fun.
-Yeah.

30:04.562 --> 30:07.904
Where'd you take her?

30:07.939 --> 30:09.466
-O'Malley's.
-What was that?

30:09.501 --> 30:10.907
I got a bad ear, Tommy boy.

30:10.942 --> 30:13.107
-I got that tinnitus.
-O'Malley's.

30:13.142 --> 30:14.845
-Wait, what--what was that?
-O'Malley's!

30:14.880 --> 30:16.110
I took her to fucking
O'Malley's.

30:16.145 --> 30:17.144
We got two dollar pints.

30:17.179 --> 30:18.981
She wanted oysters.

30:19.016 --> 30:20.411
I told you, did I not tell you?

30:20.446 --> 30:21.984
-You were right.
-Yes, I was right.

30:22.019 --> 30:24.151
I knew I was right.

30:24.186 --> 30:25.515
You gonna take her out again?

30:25.550 --> 30:28.353
-No, it was awkward.
-They always are.

30:28.388 --> 30:31.389
Yeah, you would know, you're
a real lady killer, Marty.

30:31.424 --> 30:34.590
-Yeah, in my day I was.
-And what day was that?

30:34.625 --> 30:38.902
I think Bob Cousy was playing
point for the Celtics, right.

30:38.937 --> 30:41.234
Real good,
have fun picking on me.

30:41.269 --> 30:43.467
That's jealousy.

30:43.502 --> 30:45.975
Hey.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.010
Lean in on this one.

30:48.045 --> 30:53.884
She's nice.

30:53.919 --> 30:58.383
Yeah, she's nice.

31:28.283 --> 31:33.451
I usually drink Johnny Blue.

31:33.486 --> 31:35.585
Well,
here's to Johnny Blue then.

31:35.620 --> 31:39.193
How do you guys say
"Cheers" in Italian?

31:39.228 --> 31:45.001
Salute. Cent'Anni.

31:45.036 --> 31:46.497
Ugh, Jesus.

31:46.532 --> 31:52.569
Oh hey, I'm good with
the fucking Irish piss.

31:52.604 --> 31:54.978
Look, our Dominican friends
are coming in

31:55.013 --> 31:57.112
with a shipment Friday morning.

31:57.147 --> 32:00.577
I need it in the North End
by Friday night.

32:00.612 --> 32:01.710
What is it?

32:01.745 --> 32:03.382
The fuck do you care?

32:03.417 --> 32:05.648
Does it matter?

32:05.683 --> 32:07.683
And they want to use
the Old Port instead of--

32:07.718 --> 32:09.190
What the fuck else
you guys do up here

32:09.225 --> 32:11.027
besides whack each other off,
huh?

32:13.394 --> 32:17.363
Personally, I don't think it's
any of your fucking business.

32:17.398 --> 32:21.400
All right but the Harbor
is giving us problems.

32:21.435 --> 32:25.107
Ripping up our mail,
shaking down our couriers.

32:25.142 --> 32:29.738
And you owe us one, Petey.

32:29.773 --> 32:32.015
Coastguard's giving us
problems too.

32:32.050 --> 32:34.083
Oh yeah?
Our crew can come up here

32:34.118 --> 32:37.053
and handle delivery
then if you need some help.

32:37.088 --> 32:38.582
I mean, we'll set up shop
and show you guys

32:38.617 --> 32:41.024
how to really
fucking run things.

32:41.059 --> 32:44.192
What do you think?

32:44.227 --> 32:46.590
We'll take care of the shipment.

32:46.625 --> 32:50.363
Good, I don't like long rides.

32:50.398 --> 32:52.035
I get car sick.

32:52.070 --> 32:55.731
You understand, right?

32:55.766 --> 32:57.733
Let's go.

32:57.768 --> 33:00.241
Don't fuck up.

33:27.270 --> 33:30.304
What?

33:30.339 --> 33:33.076
Does Carly live here?

33:33.111 --> 33:35.672
Fifty dollars for her time.

33:35.707 --> 33:41.051
-I'm an old friend.
-Fifty dollars to talk to her.

33:41.086 --> 33:43.614
What?

34:04.373 --> 34:07.770
Come on in.

34:31.202 --> 34:34.335
Carly.

34:39.606 --> 34:44.345
Carly.

34:44.380 --> 34:47.447
Hi.

34:47.482 --> 34:49.317
Emma Maddox.

34:49.352 --> 34:51.319
Back in the Old Port.

34:51.354 --> 34:54.652
What is it? Summer already?

34:59.857 --> 35:02.363
Why did you come back?

35:02.398 --> 35:04.893
Finally gonna take me home
with yah?

35:04.928 --> 35:07.698
Meet yah rich Daddy.

35:07.733 --> 35:10.470
That's what she used to say
to me every summer.

35:10.505 --> 35:12.835
-I meant it every time.
-Bullshit.

35:12.870 --> 35:15.838
Hey, has anyone seen the cat.

35:15.873 --> 35:17.741
I need to know what happened
to my brother.

35:26.554 --> 35:29.456
You know what?
I have 100 more dollars

35:29.491 --> 35:32.327
if you can tell me
anything about my brother.

35:47.806 --> 35:50.543
What about you?

35:50.578 --> 35:53.183
Do you know anything
about a Mikey Maddox.

35:53.218 --> 35:56.747
Yeah, uh, Mikey, uh...

35:56.782 --> 36:04.392
last I heard
he moved to Florida, yeah.

36:04.427 --> 36:07.461
Yeah, got it.

36:07.496 --> 36:11.465
Get out of here, Emma.

36:14.998 --> 36:17.372
Goodbye Carly.

36:31.388 --> 36:32.981
I don't like her
hanging out with that girl.

36:33.016 --> 36:35.852
Yeah, I know you don't.

36:35.887 --> 36:36.985
What?

36:37.020 --> 36:38.855
Don't play dumb, you know what.

36:47.668 --> 36:51.571
Hey, if it's going to be
anybody, I'm glad it's you.

36:51.606 --> 36:53.804
Get the fuck outta here, man.

36:53.839 --> 36:55.575
Drink your fucking beer.

37:05.752 --> 37:08.291
Hey.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.524
You okay?

37:10.559 --> 37:12.295
Yeah.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.890
What is that? Live lobster?

37:13.925 --> 37:18.532
No, uh, blueberry pie.

37:18.567 --> 37:20.963
I just dropped it off for Patty.

37:20.998 --> 37:23.702
I remember she used to make it
for us back in the day.

37:23.737 --> 37:25.968
Okay, fine, you can come in.

37:26.003 --> 37:29.840
No, no, I just wanted
to drop it off for her.

37:29.875 --> 37:30.742
Okay.

37:30.777 --> 37:32.348
I'll wait out here.

37:32.383 --> 37:34.581
Take your time.

37:34.616 --> 37:38.387
-I'll be right out.
-All right.

37:43.053 --> 37:45.856
It's nice up here.

37:45.891 --> 37:48.463
Fucking cold up here.

37:48.498 --> 37:50.432
I can't argue that.

37:54.999 --> 37:56.570
It's better than O'Malley's.

37:56.605 --> 37:58.671
Eh, doesn't take much.

37:58.706 --> 38:01.641
Yeah.

38:07.913 --> 38:10.749
I used to uh...

38:10.784 --> 38:14.456
I used to pretend you
and Mikey would switch places.

38:14.491 --> 38:17.954
Yeah, Mikey would go down
to private school

38:17.989 --> 38:21.089
and you'd stay up here
all winter.

38:21.124 --> 38:28.063
It was stupid.

38:28.098 --> 38:31.572
You think I let him down?

38:31.607 --> 38:34.476
Why would you say that?

38:34.511 --> 38:37.072
Because...

38:37.107 --> 38:38.678
because I could've gotten him
out of here.

38:38.713 --> 38:39.877
I could've taken him with me.

38:39.912 --> 38:42.110
Hey, hey, Emma.

38:42.145 --> 38:44.684
Mikey wasn't going anywhere.

38:44.719 --> 38:46.752
Trust me.

38:46.787 --> 38:48.853
He was a townie.

38:48.888 --> 38:52.527
Just like me.

38:52.562 --> 38:54.694
-How about you?
-Hm?

38:54.729 --> 38:57.631
You ever going anywhere?

38:57.666 --> 38:59.534
I mean, I'd like to.

38:59.569 --> 39:01.404
The furthest south I'd been
is Old Orchard Beach

39:01.439 --> 39:07.575
for crying out loud, I haven't--
I haven't been anywhere.

39:07.610 --> 39:10.809
Old Orchard Beach, oh.

39:10.844 --> 39:14.813
Like another life, right.

39:18.489 --> 39:21.457
You know,
I was thinking the other night

39:21.492 --> 39:26.055
that all those years
you never once tried to kiss me.

39:29.126 --> 39:31.093
You must think I'm ugly.

39:31.128 --> 39:32.798
Oh, you're fucking hideous,
clearly.

39:32.833 --> 39:37.605
-See? Yeah.
-Come on.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.838
You're my best friend's sister.

39:39.873 --> 39:41.136
You know,
what do you want me to do?

39:41.171 --> 39:44.480
We got like codes and shit.

39:44.515 --> 39:48.143
Boy codes, mm.

39:48.178 --> 39:50.948
Boys and their codes.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.726
Did you ever want to?

40:01.928 --> 40:04.830
Of course I wanted to.

40:04.865 --> 40:07.096
I wanted to everyday
of every summer

40:07.131 --> 40:10.968
since I met you.

40:11.003 --> 40:12.167
Well, if you're ever going to

40:12.202 --> 40:14.906
I'd say now is the perfect time.

40:58.248 --> 41:01.689
There he is,
king of the lobsters.

41:01.724 --> 41:02.954
Who the fuck are you?

41:02.989 --> 41:06.254
The better looking version
of you.

41:06.289 --> 41:09.125
I'll give you that.

41:09.160 --> 41:12.194
Where's the kid?

41:12.229 --> 41:13.734
-He's out.
-He's out.

41:13.769 --> 41:15.032
-He's out.
-Out where?

41:15.067 --> 41:16.132
-What's he doing?
-I don't know.

41:16.167 --> 41:18.772
What are you writing a book?

41:18.807 --> 41:21.170
Uh, soda water and lemon,
put it on his tab.

41:21.205 --> 41:23.513
Ha!

41:23.548 --> 41:25.845
You're still sober?

41:25.880 --> 41:28.881
Twenty-four years now, George.

41:28.916 --> 41:31.279
What are you doing at the bar?

41:31.314 --> 41:34.051
Sometimes I still miss it.

41:48.133 --> 41:50.298
Should I leave?

41:50.333 --> 41:52.773
As quickly as you can.

42:28.712 --> 42:31.174
Mikey!

42:36.720 --> 42:39.017
What?

42:39.052 --> 42:40.821
Um.

42:44.123 --> 42:46.354
I can't.

42:46.389 --> 42:48.191
Why?

42:57.037 --> 43:00.676
What is it? Tell me.

43:00.711 --> 43:02.975
It's your--

43:06.783 --> 43:08.376
What the fuck is that?
Why do you have that?

43:08.411 --> 43:11.687
-Just stay right there.
-What are you doing?

43:11.722 --> 43:14.151
Tommy. Tommy!

43:14.186 --> 43:16.120
Don't drop him again, Marty,
for Christ shake.

43:16.155 --> 43:18.056
-Come on, come on, jeez, jeez.
-You're heavy, George.

43:18.091 --> 43:21.290
Jesus.

43:21.325 --> 43:23.765
He's gonna need some ice.

43:23.800 --> 43:25.800
You say ice
one more fucking time.

43:25.835 --> 43:28.704
What the fuck happened?

43:28.739 --> 43:31.641
-Hey, who did this?
-Brennan.

43:31.676 --> 43:33.808
Jesus, George, I don't even
know where to fucking start.

43:33.843 --> 43:35.337
Mother fucker sucker punched me.

43:35.372 --> 43:37.746
Jesus Christ.

43:37.781 --> 43:41.651
-George, what happened?
-You don't need this.

43:41.686 --> 43:44.115
He needs ice.
Emma, can you get him some ice?

43:44.150 --> 43:47.019
Yes.

43:50.453 --> 43:52.794
What the fuck is she doing here?

43:52.829 --> 43:54.125
She's with me.

43:54.160 --> 43:56.226
She's been asking around
about her brother Mikey.

43:56.261 --> 43:57.799
Digging up old bones.

43:57.834 --> 43:59.130
-I didn't say nothing.
-It doesn't matter.

43:59.165 --> 44:01.396
You know how it looks.

44:01.431 --> 44:05.301
Your father picking a fight
with Brennan, I just--I...

44:05.336 --> 44:06.907
I don't know.

44:06.942 --> 44:09.239
Huh, what's that
supposed to mean?

44:10.979 --> 44:12.715
What's that mean,
"You don't know"?

44:12.750 --> 44:14.717
My hands are tied here, Tommy.

44:18.316 --> 44:20.316
Is it the debt?
'Cause I can pay it down.

44:20.351 --> 44:22.318
Father's in deep, Tommy,
real deep.

44:22.353 --> 44:24.320
Find out they're making payments
every fucking week.

44:24.355 --> 44:27.928
He disrespected a member
of the crew in front of people.

44:33.771 --> 44:35.936
What do you want me to do?

44:35.971 --> 44:37.905
You're gonna have to
go to Kerrigan.

44:37.940 --> 44:39.841
Try and work something out.

44:43.407 --> 44:45.979
No, I can't fucking go there.

44:47.851 --> 44:50.280
You don't have
another play here, Tommy.

44:50.315 --> 44:52.447
You gotta
make everything square.

45:00.259 --> 45:02.732
Keep your head up,
come on, just in case.

45:05.264 --> 45:07.495
Check on him
every couple of hours.

45:07.530 --> 45:09.365
Make sure he knows who he is.

45:09.400 --> 45:12.434
I don't think he ever does.

45:12.469 --> 45:15.074
We can two-man
the boat tomorrow.

45:15.109 --> 45:17.505
No, no, you gotta
take the day off tomorrow.

45:20.818 --> 45:23.280
And Tommy,

45:23.315 --> 45:24.919
I don't wanna start
anymore trouble,

45:24.954 --> 45:29.154
but Kerrigan's men
targeted your dad.

45:29.189 --> 45:31.959
They gave him no choice.

45:34.029 --> 45:36.293
And I wouldn't trust your uncle.

45:39.034 --> 45:41.067
We'll be at
O'Malley's tomorrow,

45:41.102 --> 45:43.135
if you need anything.

45:43.170 --> 45:45.467
Okay, thanks, Mike.

45:58.449 --> 46:00.185
He should be at Maine Med.

46:02.387 --> 46:04.552
No, he can't go to the hospital.

46:06.589 --> 46:08.193
Why?

46:10.967 --> 46:13.198
Gotta keep your mouth shut?

46:42.163 --> 46:43.998
You're still here?

46:46.596 --> 46:48.904
Yeah, I'm still here.

46:57.046 --> 46:58.408
So, you gonna start
treating me like somebody

46:58.443 --> 47:00.311
that means something to you?

47:03.283 --> 47:05.052
Why won't you tell me
what the fuck is going on?

47:05.087 --> 47:07.186
Because it's gonna
get you killed.

47:09.355 --> 47:10.893
So, keep my mouth shut?

47:12.897 --> 47:16.294
Just get out of town,
abandon my mother again?

47:16.329 --> 47:18.461
-You want me to leave you?
-No.

47:18.496 --> 47:20.397
I want you safe.

47:20.432 --> 47:22.399
That's all I want,
that's all I ever wanted,

47:22.434 --> 47:24.170
you safe.

47:27.945 --> 47:29.406
I'm not going anywhere.

47:37.581 --> 47:40.252
Fuck.

47:40.287 --> 47:43.552
Well, look who it is,
Lobster Tommy.

47:43.587 --> 47:45.488
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:48.295 --> 47:50.933
-What you got there, son?
-It's 15 grand.

47:50.968 --> 47:52.935
That's more than my father owes,
plus a juice tax

47:52.970 --> 47:54.299
down to the principle.

47:56.336 --> 47:58.941
So, are you gonna tell me
how much your dad owes?

47:58.976 --> 48:01.405
You don't need to worry
about how much my dad owes.

48:04.575 --> 48:07.147
Tommy, how much?

48:09.448 --> 48:12.086
12 grand.

48:12.121 --> 48:14.187
-He owes 12 grand.
-Okay.

48:16.092 --> 48:17.388
I have the money.

48:19.623 --> 48:21.656
Emma, I'm not taking
your money, you're crazy.

48:21.691 --> 48:24.527
Tommy, it's just money.

48:26.564 --> 48:29.202
It's just fucking money.

48:29.237 --> 48:31.435
No.

48:31.470 --> 48:34.141
I know that you know that
your pride is not as valuable

48:34.176 --> 48:36.044
as your father, right?

48:37.707 --> 48:40.345
Consider my dad's debt paid,
okay?

48:43.680 --> 48:46.252
So, about Emma.

48:49.653 --> 48:53.259
-Don't say her name.
-Easy, easy.

48:53.294 --> 48:55.459
Look, I'm sorry, Tommy,
that she's involved.

48:55.494 --> 48:58.330
Christ, I'm tore
you're involved.

48:58.365 --> 49:00.134
Man,

49:00.169 --> 49:02.301
you know how much I like
watching you fight, kid?

49:02.336 --> 49:06.173
Oof, you, now you had potential.

49:06.208 --> 49:09.209
But, quite frankly
the only reason you're alive

49:09.244 --> 49:11.310
is, well, because I spared ya.

49:11.345 --> 49:14.247
Now, you're running around with
this piece of ass and she's--

49:14.282 --> 49:16.480
she's asking questions, Tommy.

49:16.515 --> 49:19.318
We might have to
do something about that.

49:19.353 --> 49:22.387
So, here's what we're gonna do.

49:22.422 --> 49:24.994
You're gonna take that money,

49:25.029 --> 49:27.425
and you're gonna get you
and your dad out of trouble,

49:27.460 --> 49:30.098
and then you and me are gonna do
what we said we were gonna do

49:30.133 --> 49:31.561
when we were kids.

49:35.666 --> 49:38.172
I don't deserve you.

49:38.207 --> 49:39.569
I really don't.

49:41.705 --> 49:44.112
I'm not worried about the money.

49:46.248 --> 49:48.743
I'm not gonna bother you.

49:53.123 --> 49:55.156
You won't ever say that again.

50:01.296 --> 50:04.132
You know I'm not gonna
let anything happen to her.

50:04.167 --> 50:06.299
Mm, not sure I know that.

50:06.334 --> 50:07.762
No.

50:07.797 --> 50:11.172
But, I'll leave her alone
if you do me a favor.

50:11.207 --> 50:12.602
I need you to do
a little fishing for me

50:12.637 --> 50:14.373
-for some brown sugar.
-Oh, get the fuck out.

50:14.408 --> 50:16.804
You got plenty of gambling
lobster-boat junkies under--

50:16.839 --> 50:19.180
Your traps are in
the right spot, son.

50:21.778 --> 50:24.647
And you know what?

50:24.682 --> 50:27.254
I think you'd make
a good soldier, kid.

50:27.289 --> 50:30.191
Hm, what do you think,
me and you?

50:35.792 --> 50:37.660
No.

50:37.695 --> 50:40.267
I can't do it.

50:40.302 --> 50:42.533
Well, I can't promise you
something might not happen

50:42.568 --> 50:44.832
to Emma.

50:44.867 --> 50:48.572
Don't worry, Tommy,
I'll make it quick for her.

50:48.607 --> 50:50.838
Now, you're gonna
make that delivery for me

50:50.873 --> 50:52.807
on Friday,

50:52.842 --> 50:55.678
and if anything goes wrong,

50:55.713 --> 50:58.582
I swear to God you'll never
see that Emma again.

51:08.627 --> 51:11.496
Friday, Tommy.

51:32.387 --> 51:36.554
We can go to Detective Willis
and we can try to talk to him.

51:40.461 --> 51:41.856
We can't.

51:43.761 --> 51:45.563
What, are you just gonna
spend the rest of your life

51:45.598 --> 51:48.335
smuggling heroin into Maine?

51:48.370 --> 51:50.436
Are you fucking kidding me?
That's a joke!

51:55.707 --> 51:57.509
What happened to you?

51:57.544 --> 51:59.808
The Tommy that I knew
would fight,

51:59.843 --> 52:01.876
he would do what's right,
he would take a stand!

52:01.911 --> 52:03.779
The last time I fought,

52:03.814 --> 52:05.484
the last time I took a stand,
the last time

52:05.519 --> 52:08.256
I did something right,
two people got killed!

52:11.492 --> 52:14.295
And one of 'em was the person
that you and I love the most.

52:19.863 --> 52:21.698
What are you saying?

52:21.733 --> 52:24.404
What are you saying?

52:24.439 --> 52:27.275
I'm saying I got Mikey killed.

52:31.578 --> 52:33.248
He died on that corner
'cause of me,

52:33.283 --> 52:34.777
and every fucking day
I gotta look at that corner

52:34.812 --> 52:37.318
and I'm reminded
about the way he looked

52:37.353 --> 52:39.617
as I held him
in my fucking arms.

52:42.325 --> 52:44.589
I'm sorry.

52:50.498 --> 52:51.794
Emma.

53:30.802 --> 53:33.671
Tell me exactly what happened.

53:40.977 --> 53:42.779
Hands cold there, huh?

53:44.651 --> 53:46.354
-Here we go.
-Yes, hold up, hold up, hold up,

53:46.389 --> 53:49.786
-hold up, hold up.
-Leave me alone!

53:49.821 --> 53:52.426
Hey!

53:52.461 --> 53:54.725
-Yo, fucking say something.
-Leave her alone.

53:54.760 --> 53:56.430
-Mandy, you good?
-I'm fine, Tommy.

53:56.465 --> 53:58.333
Come on, let's go, it's cool,
let's go, come on.

53:58.368 --> 53:59.829
Don't you guys got
anything better to do

53:59.864 --> 54:01.930
than fucking pick on her?

54:01.965 --> 54:04.306
Go home and jerk off
or something.

54:04.341 --> 54:05.637
Fuck's the matter with you, man?

54:05.672 --> 54:06.836
Yeah, that's right,
why don't you follow

54:06.871 --> 54:09.608
your girlfriend home?

54:09.643 --> 54:10.939
Huh?

54:10.974 --> 54:13.348
You're gonna do something, huh?

54:13.383 --> 54:15.548
-Motherfucker!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

54:15.583 --> 54:17.011
-Oh!
-Jesus!

54:20.489 --> 54:21.950
Yo, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!

54:21.985 --> 54:23.853
Let's go,
get the fuck out of here!

54:23.888 --> 54:25.690
Bobby, Bobby!

54:25.725 --> 54:27.461
Jeez, he's fucking bleeding,
I don't think he's breathing.

54:27.496 --> 54:28.627
-Hey, boss.
-What the fuck happened?

54:28.662 --> 54:29.760
Some guy just fought Bobby.

54:29.795 --> 54:31.729
-I think he's dead.
-Hey!

54:31.764 --> 54:34.534
Fuck you!

54:39.101 --> 54:41.277
You know,
they should've killed me.

54:43.743 --> 54:45.578
Or I should've been

54:45.613 --> 54:47.613
thrown in jail, locked up.

54:47.648 --> 54:51.584
But, uh,

54:51.619 --> 54:54.015
that's just not how they
handle things in the Old Port.

55:02.993 --> 55:04.795
-You go first, right?
-Yeah.

55:06.733 --> 55:08.634
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

55:08.669 --> 55:09.866
Hold up.

55:09.901 --> 55:11.967
Hey, hey, no, no,
we just wanna chat, man.

55:13.806 --> 55:15.806
-Fuck you!
-Fuck off me!

55:15.841 --> 55:17.445
Mikey!

55:17.480 --> 55:18.974
Fuck!

55:21.583 --> 55:23.946
Fuck!

55:23.981 --> 55:25.816
Mikey, Mikey!

55:25.851 --> 55:26.883
Fuck off!

55:26.918 --> 55:28.951
-Motherfuckers.
-Let's go.

55:28.986 --> 55:30.623
Let's get out of here!

55:34.629 --> 55:36.090
Yo, somebody help!

55:40.404 --> 55:41.832
Fuck.

55:44.705 --> 55:46.034
Keep breathing, okay,
just keep breathing,

55:46.069 --> 55:47.772
okay, Mikey?

55:54.880 --> 55:56.484
-Oh, fuck!
-Breathe.

55:56.519 --> 55:59.454
-Breathe.
-Oh, fuck, I got shot.

55:59.489 --> 56:00.851
-Holy shit.
-You're fine, all right?

56:00.886 --> 56:04.624
You're fine, okay,
you're gonna be fine.

56:04.659 --> 56:07.594
Ambulance is coming,
you're gonna be fine.

56:10.929 --> 56:13.864
You're good, you're good,
you're good, you're good.

56:17.199 --> 56:19.804
Mikey, you're gonna be fine.

56:19.839 --> 56:22.543
Mikey, Mikey?

56:22.578 --> 56:24.138
Mikey?

56:24.173 --> 56:26.140
Mikey?

56:26.175 --> 56:27.911
Mikey, come on.

56:27.946 --> 56:29.814
Come on.

56:46.635 --> 56:48.404
Just take me fucking home.

57:10.626 --> 57:12.153
Is that your mother?

57:16.192 --> 57:18.929
-Mom?
-Emma.

57:18.964 --> 57:20.799
-Mom!
-They're gonna hurt us.

57:20.834 --> 57:22.669
-What are you doing?
-He's gonna hurt us.

57:22.704 --> 57:24.506
Nobody's gonna hurt you,
nobody's gonna hurt you.

57:24.541 --> 57:26.640
-Please, please, please.
-Tommy, please.

57:26.675 --> 57:29.203
Protect my son,
don't let him hurt him, please.

57:29.238 --> 57:31.513
-Mom, come on, get on inside.
-Please--

57:31.548 --> 57:32.811
-We're gonna be all right.
-I did what

57:32.846 --> 57:34.714
-I was supposed to do.
-Shh, it's okay.

57:34.749 --> 57:36.243
-I kept my mouth shut.
-You did, Patty,

57:36.278 --> 57:37.981
-you did a great job.
-I did, I did what

57:38.016 --> 57:39.752
they told me to do,
why don't they just

57:39.787 --> 57:41.248
leave us alone,
what's a matter with them?

57:41.283 --> 57:43.052
They will, they will, shh.

57:43.087 --> 57:45.252
-I'm so cold.
-Just get some rest.

57:45.287 --> 57:47.089
Shh.

57:51.634 --> 57:53.062
Emma, hey, Emma.

57:53.097 --> 57:55.669
Fuck out of here.

57:55.704 --> 57:57.539
Get the fuck out of here!

58:03.140 --> 58:05.107
I never wanna see you again.

58:08.046 --> 58:11.014
-Don't say that.
-Go.

58:11.049 --> 58:12.950
Go!

58:47.756 --> 58:49.756
Here's the burner.

58:49.791 --> 58:52.088
Once you make the drop,
confirm the number,

58:52.123 --> 58:53.892
and ditch it.

58:59.768 --> 59:02.164
Things could be worse, Tommy.

59:02.199 --> 59:03.935
You could have cancer.

59:06.643 --> 59:08.104
Ah, come on.

59:08.139 --> 59:10.106
You act like it's the end
of the fucking world.

59:12.143 --> 59:14.682
This is the life we chose.

59:14.717 --> 59:16.211
You got a problem with Kerrigan?

59:16.246 --> 59:18.785
Guess what happens
to this town without him.

59:18.820 --> 59:20.215
You don't want the North End
running things around here,

59:20.250 --> 59:21.854
trust me.

59:23.726 --> 59:25.286
And if this shipment doesn't
make the North End tomorrow,

59:25.321 --> 59:27.596
we're all dead.

59:27.631 --> 59:30.225
So, don't think about
doing anything stupid, Tom.

59:30.260 --> 59:33.701
Yeah, sometimes a man's gotta do
what he don't wanna do,

59:33.736 --> 59:35.835
right?

59:35.870 --> 59:37.903
-Yeah.
-Right.

1:00:14.106 --> 1:00:15.369
What are you doing up?

1:00:15.404 --> 1:00:17.877
It's your day off.

1:00:17.912 --> 1:00:20.308
Can't sleep past
5:00 AM anymore.

1:00:24.952 --> 1:00:27.381
Wanna have
my last drink with me?

1:00:27.416 --> 1:00:29.955
After this I'm done.

1:00:35.897 --> 1:00:38.161
This time is for real,
Tommy Gun.

1:00:38.196 --> 1:00:40.031
I'm off it.

1:00:40.066 --> 1:00:42.396
Yeah, I've heard that before.

1:00:42.431 --> 1:00:44.233
To better days.

1:00:53.112 --> 1:00:55.684
Your mother,

1:00:55.719 --> 1:00:58.753
go figure, she never smoked.

1:00:58.788 --> 1:01:00.249
Rarely drank.

1:01:02.792 --> 1:01:05.320
She's the one that dies
of the fucking cancer.

1:01:08.732 --> 1:01:11.161
You know,
I don't even remember her.

1:01:11.196 --> 1:01:12.998
Rose was good.

1:01:17.741 --> 1:01:20.401
Nah.

1:01:20.436 --> 1:01:22.469
She was great.

1:01:26.783 --> 1:01:30.015
I should've been better
for you, Tommy Gun.

1:01:30.050 --> 1:01:31.951
You deserve better.

1:01:36.023 --> 1:01:37.726
They say our traps
are in a good spot

1:01:37.761 --> 1:01:40.762
for smuggling drugs, huh?

1:01:40.797 --> 1:01:42.192
Too bad they were
in a shitty spot

1:01:42.227 --> 1:01:43.897
for catching lobster.

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.499
Oh.

1:01:54.976 --> 1:01:57.339
I should be on that boat.

1:01:57.374 --> 1:02:00.276
Yeah, you probably should be.

1:02:00.311 --> 1:02:02.377
But, it ain't just
about you anymore, Pop.

1:02:14.864 --> 1:02:16.259
I'm not coming back.

1:02:19.462 --> 1:02:21.770
I love you.

1:02:56.268 --> 1:02:58.939
At the tone,
please record your message.

1:02:58.974 --> 1:03:02.074
Emma, it's me, I'm calling you
from a burner phone, okay?

1:03:02.109 --> 1:03:03.504
I just gotta know you're safe.

1:03:03.539 --> 1:03:05.814
Can you just call me back
and tell me you got out of town,

1:03:05.849 --> 1:03:08.311
please?

1:03:08.346 --> 1:03:10.511
Darlene, keep 'em coming.

1:03:18.587 --> 1:03:20.323
Thank you.

1:03:33.470 --> 1:03:35.041
Mom?

1:03:35.076 --> 1:03:37.912
Mom, are you ready?

1:03:37.947 --> 1:03:40.046
Hey, Emma.

1:03:40.081 --> 1:03:41.850
Welcome home.

1:03:53.523 --> 1:03:55.292
You can have a seat.

1:03:55.327 --> 1:03:56.997
Come on.

1:04:15.611 --> 1:04:17.215
I found her like that.

1:04:49.381 --> 1:04:50.677
Is that your brother?

1:04:52.714 --> 1:04:55.187
That was my brother.

1:04:55.222 --> 1:04:57.585
Yeah, I remember him.

1:04:57.620 --> 1:04:59.620
He bled a lot.

1:05:13.207 --> 1:05:14.470
What?

1:05:18.278 --> 1:05:19.981
At the tone, please--

1:05:20.016 --> 1:05:21.477
Fuck!

1:05:25.450 --> 1:05:28.022
What are you guys planning?

1:05:28.057 --> 1:05:29.419
We're not planning anything.

1:05:29.454 --> 1:05:31.586
Don't fucking lie to me.

1:05:31.621 --> 1:05:33.324
Are you talking to the cops?

1:05:33.359 --> 1:05:35.392
No.

1:05:35.427 --> 1:05:38.329
Are you talking to the cops?

1:05:38.364 --> 1:05:40.562
You heard me the first time,

1:05:40.597 --> 1:05:43.730
and I said, "No."

1:05:46.174 --> 1:05:47.503
At the tone--

1:05:47.538 --> 1:05:49.241
Fuck!

1:05:49.276 --> 1:05:51.309
Damn it.

1:05:53.775 --> 1:05:55.544
O'Malley's.

1:05:55.579 --> 1:05:57.249
Oh, hey, babe.

1:05:57.284 --> 1:05:59.449
Yeah, he's here, sure.

1:05:59.484 --> 1:06:01.319
Marty, you got a phone call.

1:06:03.290 --> 1:06:04.685
For me?

1:06:07.690 --> 1:06:10.031
Hello.

1:06:10.066 --> 1:06:11.296
Hello?

1:06:11.331 --> 1:06:14.728
No, no I--
I can't even hear you.

1:06:14.763 --> 1:06:16.367
Okay.

1:06:16.402 --> 1:06:19.007
Okay, on it.

1:06:21.671 --> 1:06:24.111
Tommy told you, didn't he?

1:06:24.146 --> 1:06:25.706
Tommy didn't tell me anything.

1:06:28.612 --> 1:06:30.183
Mhm.

1:06:41.757 --> 1:06:43.460
You should've never came back.

1:06:52.669 --> 1:06:54.240
Come on!

1:07:00.677 --> 1:07:03.348
-Ahh!
-Ugh!

1:07:21.566 --> 1:07:24.105
Mrs. Maddox.

1:07:24.140 --> 1:07:26.338
Hello, Mrs. Maddox?

1:07:26.373 --> 1:07:28.076
It's Marty.

1:07:32.511 --> 1:07:34.511
Ahh!

1:07:34.546 --> 1:07:37.448
Mrs. Maddox.

1:07:51.530 --> 1:07:54.300
Mrs. Maddox.

1:07:54.335 --> 1:07:56.434
-Hello?
-Shut the fuck up.

1:07:59.637 --> 1:08:02.341
Shh.

1:08:09.449 --> 1:08:11.350
Shh, shut the fuck up.

1:08:17.523 --> 1:08:18.687
George, I'm coming!

1:08:22.759 --> 1:08:24.330
George, the gun, George!

1:08:24.365 --> 1:08:26.596
Goddamnit!

1:08:32.604 --> 1:08:34.835
Wake up, George,
wake the fuck up!

1:09:19.915 --> 1:09:21.453
The fuck?

1:09:25.393 --> 1:09:27.690
Emma, Emma.

1:09:27.725 --> 1:09:30.858
You good, Emma, Emma, you okay?

1:09:30.893 --> 1:09:32.299
You okay?

1:09:32.334 --> 1:09:33.729
Okay.

1:09:33.764 --> 1:09:37.238
-Pop, you all right?
-I'm fine, check on Marty.

1:09:37.273 --> 1:09:38.833
Okay, Marty, you good?

1:09:38.868 --> 1:09:40.604
Couple things.

1:09:40.639 --> 1:09:43.970
That curved spine,
it's--it's straight now.

1:09:44.005 --> 1:09:47.479
Needs straightening, but C4, C5,

1:09:47.514 --> 1:09:48.777
for sure, broken.

1:09:48.812 --> 1:09:50.680
Okay, I'm glad
you're all right, Marty.

1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:15.243
All right, go ahead
and kill the bitch.

1:10:18.743 --> 1:10:21.381
Brennan?

1:10:21.416 --> 1:10:22.910
It's Tommy.

1:10:22.945 --> 1:10:25.748
Tommy?

1:10:25.783 --> 1:10:27.684
All right.

1:10:27.719 --> 1:10:29.983
Well, what's your play, kid?
We ain't got a lot of time.

1:10:38.598 --> 1:10:41.500
No, Petey.

1:10:41.535 --> 1:10:43.403
You don't have a lot of time.

1:10:45.836 --> 1:10:47.770
Tommy Gun,

1:10:47.805 --> 1:10:49.541
get out of here.

1:11:04.327 --> 1:11:05.854
I was the first
to arrive on the scene,

1:11:05.889 --> 1:11:07.757
along with Lieutenant Miller.

1:11:07.792 --> 1:11:10.859
We thought double homicide,
but she died of natural causes.

1:11:10.894 --> 1:11:13.466
Him, not so much.

1:11:16.097 --> 1:11:18.603
Copy that, on my way out.

1:11:37.723 --> 1:11:39.085
Robbery gone bad?

1:11:41.056 --> 1:11:42.957
Any eye witnesses?

1:11:42.992 --> 1:11:44.629
No.

1:11:44.664 --> 1:11:46.433
I think robbery gone bad.

1:11:46.468 --> 1:11:48.402
Plenty of desperate junkies
in this neighborhood.

1:11:48.437 --> 1:11:50.767
Will you excuse us?

1:11:57.611 --> 1:12:00.106
Is there something
you wanna tell me, Officer?

1:12:00.141 --> 1:12:01.943
No.

1:12:06.752 --> 1:12:09.555
You really think this looks
like a robbery gone bad?

1:12:09.590 --> 1:12:11.051
Yeah.

1:12:17.433 --> 1:12:20.731
If it wasn't a robbery gone bad,

1:12:20.766 --> 1:12:24.735
there might be big fish
swimming into Old Port,

1:12:24.770 --> 1:12:26.605
fish you ain't got a boat for.

1:12:47.155 --> 1:12:50.695
Yeah, Rocco,
we, uh--we got the shipment.

1:12:50.730 --> 1:12:52.697
But, um,

1:12:52.732 --> 1:12:55.799
our guy felt a little heat,
so, uh--so he had to back off.

1:12:55.834 --> 1:12:57.801
You kidding me,
you trying to fuck us, Petey?

1:12:57.836 --> 1:12:59.132
-No.
-This doesn't sound good.

1:12:59.167 --> 1:13:00.672
-No, we have it.
-You know what?

1:13:00.707 --> 1:13:02.003
I'll fucking see you
when I get there.

1:13:02.038 --> 1:13:03.675
That's not necessary.

1:13:16.184 --> 1:13:18.525
-Shut the fuck up!
-Shut up!

1:13:23.565 --> 1:13:25.598
What happened?

1:13:25.633 --> 1:13:27.996
I--I don't know what happened.

1:13:28.031 --> 1:13:30.537
The kid messed up.

1:13:30.572 --> 1:13:31.802
When was the last time
you talked to him?

1:13:31.837 --> 1:13:33.199
Last night.

1:13:33.234 --> 1:13:35.806
I gave him the burner.

1:13:35.841 --> 1:13:38.479
I--I talked to him,
made sure he knew.

1:13:38.514 --> 1:13:40.173
Oh.

1:13:44.146 --> 1:13:46.454
Knew what?

1:13:46.489 --> 1:13:48.753
What the fucking stakes are.

1:14:03.671 --> 1:14:05.066
Please.

1:14:11.041 --> 1:14:13.074
You know where he is now?

1:14:21.722 --> 1:14:24.052
Okay.

1:14:34.900 --> 1:14:37.505
Christ, Billy.

1:14:37.540 --> 1:14:39.199
You're gonna die with
fucking carrot juice stains

1:14:39.234 --> 1:14:40.739
on your shirt.

1:15:27.887 --> 1:15:30.624
There's nobody here.

1:15:33.189 --> 1:15:34.793
-Come help me with this body.
-Shh.

1:15:43.100 --> 1:15:44.935
-No!
-Drop the fucking gun.

1:15:44.970 --> 1:15:48.642
-Fucking shoot him, shoot him!
-Drop the fucking gun.

1:15:48.677 --> 1:15:51.139
-There you go.
-You're a fucking dead man.

1:15:51.174 --> 1:15:53.845
-Huh, huh?
-You're a fucking dead--

1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:55.781
Ahh!

1:16:42.060 --> 1:16:44.126
Well, look at you
with a gun in your hand.

1:16:45.932 --> 1:16:48.229
It's a long time coming,
huh, Tommy?

1:16:51.267 --> 1:16:54.037
You know you get rid of me
and you're fucked.

1:16:54.072 --> 1:16:56.644
This whole town is fucked.

1:16:56.679 --> 1:16:59.075
You're gonna have to answer
to the North End.

1:17:01.717 --> 1:17:04.377
You think I'm bad?

1:17:04.412 --> 1:17:06.247
You were gonna have her killed.

1:17:09.417 --> 1:17:11.351
You had her brother killed.

1:17:13.388 --> 1:17:15.157
I've had to live in fear

1:17:15.192 --> 1:17:18.061
my entire life 'cause of you.

1:17:18.096 --> 1:17:20.162
You fucking with my father.

1:17:20.197 --> 1:17:22.296
Every boxing match
seeing your face

1:17:22.331 --> 1:17:25.398
looking over me,
fucking with me.

1:17:25.433 --> 1:17:29.204
I'm a bad man, Tommy,
I've done a lot of bad things.

1:17:29.239 --> 1:17:30.711
But, you know what?

1:17:30.746 --> 1:17:33.813
You and me, we're the same.

1:17:33.848 --> 1:17:35.815
Oh yeah,
you got that boy killed.

1:17:35.850 --> 1:17:38.246
That blood's on your hands, son,
you did that.

1:17:41.251 --> 1:17:43.790
And let's not forget,

1:17:43.825 --> 1:17:46.221
only reason you're here
is 'cause I spared ya.

1:17:48.060 --> 1:17:50.830
Why?

1:17:50.865 --> 1:17:52.425
Why'd you spare me?

1:17:52.460 --> 1:17:54.229
Why didn't you kill me, hm?

1:17:54.264 --> 1:17:56.803
Why'd you spare me?
Tell me, tell me!

1:17:56.838 --> 1:17:58.233
Why?

1:18:00.336 --> 1:18:04.140
Tommy, listen to me.

1:18:04.175 --> 1:18:07.011
Why don't you do yourself
and this whole town a favor?

1:18:07.046 --> 1:18:09.079
All right, and just hand
that shipment over to me.

1:18:11.083 --> 1:18:12.478
I'll take care of the degos,

1:18:12.513 --> 1:18:15.118
and I swear to God

1:18:15.153 --> 1:18:16.856
I'll let you and the bitch go.

1:18:24.833 --> 1:18:27.097
Please, son.

1:18:27.132 --> 1:18:28.868
Huh?

1:18:32.907 --> 1:18:35.369
How afraid are you right now?

1:21:14.629 --> 1:21:16.365
Hey.

1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:18.268
You Tommy?

1:21:43.460 --> 1:21:45.361
All right then.

1:21:51.039 --> 1:21:53.138
Open it up, Jimmy.

1:22:01.082 --> 1:22:02.378
It's all there.

1:22:04.283 --> 1:22:06.646
That's a good thing
for you and me.

1:22:11.587 --> 1:22:13.422
And you'll be needing this.

1:22:21.696 --> 1:22:24.037
I'll be in touch.

1:22:52.529 --> 1:22:58.368
when you're dead and gone

1:22:58.403 --> 1:23:04.704
in the valley of the mountain

1:23:04.739 --> 1:23:07.212
I'll lay my bones

1:23:07.247 --> 1:23:10.149
Hon?

1:23:10.184 --> 1:23:11.480
Bill, you down there?

1:23:14.155 --> 1:23:16.485
Bill?

1:23:20.425 --> 1:23:24.031
Most people, you hear a shotgun,
you go the other way.

1:23:24.066 --> 1:23:25.692
Not Marty.

1:23:25.727 --> 1:23:27.298
I went in,

1:23:27.333 --> 1:23:29.630
and go to where the sound was.

1:23:31.766 --> 1:23:34.173
You all have a chance
at some point in your life

1:23:34.208 --> 1:23:35.669
to define who you are.

1:23:35.704 --> 1:23:38.507
When you hear that gunshot,
go in.

1:23:38.542 --> 1:23:40.443
Go in, my friend.

1:23:40.478 --> 1:23:43.380
Even you,
fucking coward that you are.

1:23:43.415 --> 1:23:46.251
stop you moving

1:23:46.286 --> 1:23:48.682
I always thought
an alcoholic was that guy

1:23:48.717 --> 1:23:51.487
laying in the gutter,
couldn't take care of himself.

1:23:51.522 --> 1:23:53.192
Couldn't function.

1:23:53.227 --> 1:23:56.525
Lobster men, I've been
a lobster man my whole life.

1:23:56.560 --> 1:23:58.692
I'm George,
and I'm an alcoholic.

1:24:02.533 --> 1:24:06.535
I'll see you there

1:24:06.570 --> 1:24:08.240
Hey.

1:24:08.275 --> 1:24:10.473
Yeah?

1:24:10.508 --> 1:24:12.838
You remember what we said
to each other when we were kids?

1:24:17.548 --> 1:24:19.251
Hey.

1:24:21.321 --> 1:24:23.255
Stay safe.

1:24:23.290 --> 1:24:28.755
in the valley of the mountain

1:24:28.790 --> 1:24:30.823
One day we'd
make summer last forever.

1:24:30.858 --> 1:24:36.730
when I've reached my prime

1:24:36.765 --> 1:24:39.271
Come home to us.

1:24:39.306 --> 1:24:40.734
I will.

1:24:44.773 --> 1:24:48.181
I'll see you there

1:24:48.216 --> 1:24:51.349
with your autumn hair

1:24:51.384 --> 1:24:54.451
I'll see you there

1:24:59.425 --> 1:25:05.462
is resemblance of a sound

1:25:05.497 --> 1:25:08.630
and I've waited

1:25:11.173 --> 1:25:13.470
Sometimes a man's gotta do
what he doesn't wanna do.

1:25:15.210 --> 1:25:18.343
To protect the ones he loves.

1:25:18.378 --> 1:25:19.905
To protect the town he loves.

1:25:22.283 --> 1:25:24.646
'Cause there's always
a bigger fish.

1:25:26.881 --> 1:25:30.388
I'll see you there

1:25:30.423 --> 1:25:33.589
with your autumn hair

1:25:33.624 --> 1:25:36.757
I'll see you there

1:25:41.896 --> 1:25:44.897
I'll see you there

1:25:44.932 --> 1:25:48.307
with your autumn hair

1:25:48.342 --> 1:25:51.442
I'll see you there
