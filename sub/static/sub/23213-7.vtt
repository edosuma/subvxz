-Morning, Florence.
-Morning, sir.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.200
-Where have you been?
-JACK: Night fishing
of all things.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.320
I stopped off for a quick rum
after work

03:59.400 --> 04:00.880
got chatting to Bernard here,

04:00.960 --> 04:03.000
and I happened to mention
that I used to go
fishing for trout

04:03.080 --> 04:04.360
with my Uncle Terence as a kid.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.880
Anyway, one thing
led to another,

04:06.960 --> 04:08.440
next thing you know,

04:08.520 --> 04:11.680
I've only gone and caught myself
a real live snapper.

04:11.760 --> 04:15.160
Only, he's not so live now,
obviously.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.000
-Well done, sir.
That's a big one.
-Thank you.

04:19.080 --> 04:21.440
So we got a suspected murder
Is it far from here?

04:21.520 --> 04:22.640
It's a ten-minute drive.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.560
Dwayne and JP are waiting
at the crime scene.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.160
Okay, no time to waste.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.480
-Thanks, Bernard.
Cracking night.
-BERNARD: No problem, sir.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.960
Must do it again soon.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.520
So what have we got, Dwayne?

04:41.600 --> 04:43.440
Looks like a robbery
gone wrong, Chief.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.760
This neighbour called up
about a disturbance.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.760
He was putting out his rubbish
just after midnight

04:48.840 --> 04:52.040
and he heard shouting
coming from inside
the neighbour's house.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.480
Then he noticed
the pickup truck.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.680
When we got there,

04:54.760 --> 04:55.960
I had to breach the front door,

04:56.040 --> 04:57.680
we found the owner
dead on the floor,

04:57.760 --> 05:00.080
and the assailant
making a run for it.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.840
Did you manage to arrest him?

05:01.920 --> 05:04.160
Ah. That's the bad news.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.600
Just as JP was
about to cuff the suspect,

05:06.680 --> 05:08.400
he broke loose
and skedaddled.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.960
Unlucky.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.040
I don't suppose
there's any good news
to go with the bad?

05:12.120 --> 05:14.520
Strangely enough,
Chief, there is.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.840
JP knows exactly who it is.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.720
JP: Cordell Thomas, sir.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.640
We were at the same school
for a while.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.960
It's a few years ago now,
but, erm, I remember his face.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.080
That's definitely
his truck parked outside?

05:31.160 --> 05:33.240
I checked the documentation
in the glove compartment.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.520
It's his.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.640
Oh, the suspect dropped this
when JP tackled him.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.240
Jeepers! Jewellery.
Look at that.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.880
-Fair old whack.
-JP: If I'm to be honest
with you, sir.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.440
I can't say I'm surprised
to find him caught up
in something like this.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.000
Cordell was always
in trouble at school.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.840
-And who here is our victim?
-Eugene Jones.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.680
Quite a known face
around the island.
A bit of a character.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.120
Owns Lily's Cafe
on the high street
and a few other businesses.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.160
Er, a souvenir stall
by the harbour,

06:02.240 --> 06:03.920
couple of hire cars,
you know, that kind of thing.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.920
-Quite the entrepreneur, eh?
-Hmm.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.320
And it was definitely his voice
the neighbour heard arguing?

06:08.400 --> 06:11.760
Yes. But he couldn't
make out the other person.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.720
FLORENCE:
From the shape of wound,

06:13.800 --> 06:16.720
it looks like the victim
was hit by this.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.200
Erm, must have come from there.

06:21.160 --> 06:24.800
So they tussled over here,
by the coffee table,

06:24.880 --> 06:27.400
the vase gets knocked over,

06:27.480 --> 06:32.560
the pair of them end up
over here, near the sideboard

06:32.640 --> 06:36.760
where the suspect grabs
the ornament and hits the victim
on the head with it.

06:36.840 --> 06:40.240
Victim staggers back,
falls to the floor just here,

06:40.320 --> 06:42.200
and then crawls forward.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.040
Right. Let's get that ornament
to the lab for a start.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.800
You know, I always wondered
about silk pyjamas.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.640
Are they worth the extra cost?

06:53.720 --> 06:57.840
You know, compared to
the more traditional
cotton-polyester mix.

06:57.920 --> 06:58.880
I don't know, sir.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.080
The worth of the pyjamas
depends on the
quality of the silk.

07:03.160 --> 07:06.400
And from where
I'm standing, with all due
respect to the dead,

07:06.480 --> 07:08.760
-that is some cheap silk.
-I'll take your word for it.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.520
You clearly know your pyjamas.

07:14.440 --> 07:15.400
Strange.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.520
He's holding something.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.560
DWAYNE:
Is that a peanut, Chief?

07:23.640 --> 07:24.920
It is indeed, Dwayne.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.080
Now, why would our victim
be clutching a peanut?

07:29.520 --> 07:31.480
You didn't notice
any more of these
lying around the place?

07:31.560 --> 07:33.240
No, Chief. No nuts.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.840
Ah.

07:34.920 --> 07:37.120
Well, we should do
a proper search anyway,
just to make sure.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.920
-Did he have any relatives?
-Yes. One sister. Celeste.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.160
We're going to see her
after we finish up here.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.520
Right, then.
We can release the body.
Finish processing the scene.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.000
Florence, while
they're doing that,

07:47.080 --> 07:48.840
I think we should
head back to the station

07:48.920 --> 07:51.280
and try to figure out where
our killer is hiding himself.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.640
(CAR DOORS SHUT)

07:53.720 --> 07:56.720
Right, first things first.
I'm gonna put Sammy
here in the fridge.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.280
Then we check
the electoral register for
Cordell's home address.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.160
I mean, it's unlikely
he'll head back there,

08:01.240 --> 08:03.520
but we need to
make absolutely sure.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.000
Sir, you named him Sammy?

08:06.080 --> 08:07.920
Why? You don't think
he looks like a Sammy?

08:09.560 --> 08:11.440
Morning.
Can we help you at all?

08:12.360 --> 08:13.400
I'm Cordell Thomas.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.840
I know you know
it was me that did it, so...

08:18.520 --> 08:19.840
I've come to hand myself in.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.120
I've been working for Eugene
for the past four months.

08:24.200 --> 08:28.280
Driving him around,
making deliveries, pickups.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.600
So you knew whose house it was
you were breaking into.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.600
A few days ago,
I was dropping off
the weekly takings.

08:36.680 --> 08:40.680
Eugene got out this sports bag,
asked me to take a look inside.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.840
I knew straight away
the stuff was stolen.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.560
He asked me if I thought
I could sell it on for
a cut of the profits.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.600
And what did you say?

08:47.600 --> 08:49.080
I told him I'd think about it.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.600
Kept talking myself
out of it, but...

08:52.680 --> 08:55.080
The little devil on your
shoulder got the better of you.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.080
I got to thinking
what if I cut Eugene out,

09:00.160 --> 09:03.440
split no profits,
take the jewellery
and sell it myself.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.320
And that's why you broke in.

09:05.400 --> 09:09.320
Eugene had told me he'd
be out late last night,
so I went round there.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.920
FLORENCE: What time was this?
CORDELL: Just before midnight.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.320
I know he always leaves a window
around the back ajar

09:15.400 --> 09:17.680
to let some air in,
so I climbed through.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.840
Eugene must have
come home early
and gone to bed.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.400
He came downstairs
and found you?

09:23.480 --> 09:26.360
He lost it when he
saw what I was doing.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.800
Came at me, pushed me
against the wall, hurting me.

09:31.520 --> 09:34.480
So I grabbed the closest thing
at hand and I hit him.

09:34.560 --> 09:38.440
I didn't mean to do it as hard
as I did, but I didn't know
how else to stop him.

09:38.960 --> 09:39.920
Hmm.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.520
One question, Cordell.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.840
When you hit Eugene,
did he go down straight away?

09:49.360 --> 09:51.640
Er... Why? What is it?

09:51.720 --> 09:56.520
Well, it's just we found this
at the crime scene.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.760
-A peanut?
-Yeah, it was in Eugene's hand.

09:58.840 --> 10:01.840
And I'm just wondering if you've
any idea how it got there.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.560
Erm, I've no idea.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.840
It's a bit odd though,
don't you think?

10:08.920 --> 10:12.040
I mean, I assume he wasn't
holding on to it
when he attacked you.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.920
He didn't attack you
with a peanut, did he?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.160
No, of course not.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.800
No, that would be just
plain weird, wouldn't it?

10:17.880 --> 10:20.160
So, if he was out cold
after you hit him,

10:20.240 --> 10:22.600
then how did he end up
with a peanut in his hand?

10:24.080 --> 10:26.600
-I don't know.
-Me neither.

10:42.080 --> 10:45.200
Something tells me you don't
think he's telling the truth.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.200
It's the peanut, Florence.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.400
Cordell was as baffled by it
being in Eugene's hand
as we were.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.480
Yet, he was supposedly there
when it all happened.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.560
So you think Cordell wasn't
there when it happened?

10:54.640 --> 10:55.840
Maybe.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.520
Then that would mean
someone else is the killer.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.520
But all the evidence
we've uncovered so far

11:00.600 --> 11:02.400
supports Cordell's statement.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.800
How he got in through
the window knowing the jewellery
would be there.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.200
And we've also got a witness

11:07.280 --> 11:10.040
who saw his truck outside
at the time of the murder.

11:10.120 --> 11:13.480
So if it wasn't
Cordell that did it...

11:13.560 --> 11:15.680
Then why does it
look exactly like he did?

11:18.240 --> 11:19.400
(SIGHS)

11:20.800 --> 11:22.520
(DWAYNE EXHALES)

11:22.600 --> 11:25.240
Well, JP, after the
night we've had,

11:25.320 --> 11:26.960
I would say we've definitely
earned this one.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.280
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. Thanks, Dwayne.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.040
Ah!

11:32.120 --> 11:34.000
-What's that?
-Eh? A muffin.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.320
-You have a muffin?
-Yes.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.960
Angelique at the bakery said
I could have one as a treat.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.680
So why do you get
a treat and I don't?

11:40.760 --> 11:42.160
Because it's not
your special day, is it?

11:43.800 --> 11:46.040
Oh. It's your birthday.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.320
I totally forgot, Dwayne.
I'm so sorry.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.640
It's not a biggie.
It's not a real
landmark birthday.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.840
But still.
Happy birthday, partner.

-CELESTE: We're not open yet.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.360

It's about Eugene.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.600
(SIGHS) What?

12:22.920 --> 12:24.440
I'm afraid it's not good news.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.080
We found him dead
at his house last night.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.440
Well, sorry.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.400
What happened?

12:32.480 --> 12:34.480
Er, well, there was
an intruder.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.600
Looks like Eugene
confronted him.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.720
-An intruder?
-DWAYNE: Yes.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.400
You know who it was?

12:47.360 --> 12:49.680
JACK: Ah, gents, how did you
get on with the sister?

12:49.760 --> 12:51.960
Er, sir, she was pretty upset.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.480
-Oh.
-JP: Yeah.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.400
We told her we have
a suspect in mind.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.160
-And what did she say?
-Well, she wasn't
wholly surprised.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.640
She was a bit wary
when Eugene took on Cordell.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.920
Had heard about his reputation.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.600
(EXHALES) And what about
the victim's house?
Find any more nuts?

13:05.680 --> 13:07.320
Not a single one.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.440
We found jars of rice,
pasta and beans in the kitchen.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.320
But none with any nuts in it.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.320
What's that smell?

13:16.400 --> 13:18.880
Ah. That'll be Sammy.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.520
Sammy? Who's Sammy?

13:20.600 --> 13:22.960
Er, Sammy the snapper.
I caught him last night.

13:23.040 --> 13:25.120
Yeah, he's taken up
temporary residence
in the fridge.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.000
So apologies for
any residual pong.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.360
Maybe we should give it a spray.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.640
Anyway, how are
things here, sir?
Any closer finding Cordell?

13:35.720 --> 13:39.000
Closer than you'd expect, JP.
He's in the cells as we speak.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.520
-What?
-Well, we can't take
any credit for it.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.760
FLORENCE: Cordell was here
waiting for us when we got back.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.520
Confessed to the whole thing.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.800
So that's great. Case closed.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.640
Actually, the case
is still firmly open.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.720
But you just said
he confessed, sir.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.520
FLORENCE: The Inspector thinks
Cordell might be innocent.

13:58.600 --> 13:59.840
I should have known.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.840
Okay, I don't understand, sir.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.880
Cordell has admitted
that he did it.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.400
I know, JP.
It doesn't make any sense.

14:06.480 --> 14:09.560
But I think Cordell has been
lying to us about what happened.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.560
And we got 24 hours
before we have to charge him,

14:11.640 --> 14:14.480
so I want us to treat this as an
unsolved murder investigation.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.040
Mmm. You're the Chief, Chief.

14:17.120 --> 14:22.320
Okay, so, sir, our victim,
Eugene Barnaby Jones.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.360
Forty-three years of age,
never married,

14:24.440 --> 14:26.880
inherited his mother's business,
Lily's Cafe,

14:26.960 --> 14:28.240
when she died four years ago.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.360
All right. And would you say
he was a well liked man?

14:30.440 --> 14:33.000
Not really. Used to get
a lot of people's backs up.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.400
Er, but to the extent of
somebody actually killing him?

14:36.480 --> 14:38.520
And yet, kill him, somebody did.

14:38.600 --> 14:42.200
And our only suspect so far
is this man, Cordell Thomas.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.000
He claims he landed
the fatal blow during
a botched robbery.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.280
Twenty-eight years old,

14:46.360 --> 14:49.560
attended Honore High School
until the age of 16.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.520
Since he left, he seems to have
drifted round the island,

14:52.600 --> 14:54.000
taking cash-in-hand work.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.920
That sounds like Cordell, sir.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.280
He was always a bit of a loner.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.400
And he has form right?

14:59.040 --> 15:00.360
Probably.

15:00.440 --> 15:05.040
Two charges of theft
and one for aggravated assault.

15:05.120 --> 15:09.200
So, if Cordell isn't our killer,
that can only mean one thing.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.600
Somebody else is.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.280
So who was it?
Why did they do it?

15:12.360 --> 15:15.440
And why is Cordell willing
to go to prison for them?

15:15.520 --> 15:18.400
And if we can answer all that,
maybe we get to the bottom of

15:18.480 --> 15:22.880
why our victim died holding
a lone peanut in his hand.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.280
So where do you
want us to start?

15:26.320 --> 15:28.000
-Do we know where Cordell lives?
-Mmm-hmm.

15:28.080 --> 15:31.160
He rents a flat at the old
plantation house outside town.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.360
Okay, why don't you fellows go
and give it the once over?

15:33.440 --> 15:34.440
Yes, Chief.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.600
JP.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.080
Er, Florence,
you and I should start

15:41.160 --> 15:43.280
with what I reckon is our
strongest lead we have so far.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.080
-The stolen jewellery.
-Exactly.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.680
I really don't know why we're
wasting time like this.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.320
We've got a guy in custody
with proven form

15:52.400 --> 15:55.280
and he's confessed
to the murder.

15:55.360 --> 15:58.760
-What more does
the Inspector want?
-For you to follow orders.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.000
Look, if the Chief wants us
to look under every stone

16:05.080 --> 16:08.040
and give the place a twice over,
that's his prerogative.

16:09.240 --> 16:10.240
Hello.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.560
Oh, oh. Excuse me, miss.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.920
Er, we're looking
for room number 12.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.800
-Cordell Thomas' apartment.
-That's right. You know him?

16:17.880 --> 16:20.000
I caretake this place,
so I see him round.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.120
-Has something happened?
-He's been arrested.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.800
Er, he was caught
breaking into someone's house.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.080
But I'm afraid that's all
we can say at the moment

16:27.160 --> 16:30.720
because it's still very much
an ongoing police investigation.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.720
-And the flat would be?
-I'll show you.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.640
Bedroom.
Bathroom down there.

16:44.720 --> 16:45.680
DWAYNE: Mmm-hmm.

16:47.800 --> 16:52.320
-Well, erm, thank you,
Miss, er...
-Gayle. Marie Gayle.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.680
Ah, Marie. Thank you very much.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.680
JP.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.960
I'm sorry.
Are you sure it was Cordell?

17:00.040 --> 17:03.480
Why? Is there someone else
you think it could be?

17:03.560 --> 17:07.760
-No. Just doesn't
sound like him.
-And what makes you say that?

17:07.840 --> 17:11.240
I don't know Cordell that well.
You know, just to
pass in the corridor.

17:11.320 --> 17:14.480
But he seems decent.
You know, kind.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.000
That's all.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.680
Okay.

17:19.840 --> 17:20.800
Thank you.

17:24.560 --> 17:29.000
Look, maybe the Chief's right
about this.

17:29.080 --> 17:33.080
Maybe Cordell has changed
since you knew him. Hmm?

17:35.760 --> 17:38.080
FLORENCE: That would be great.
No, no, I can hold.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.160
That's interesting.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.840
This necklace,
it's got the initials "L.B."

17:43.920 --> 17:45.840
Have you come across anyone
with those initials?

17:45.920 --> 17:47.880
I've been calling
around the locksmiths

17:47.960 --> 17:50.160
to see if they've attended
any unreported break-ins.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.040
-Not having any joy?
-I wasn't.

17:52.120 --> 17:55.040
But I just spoke to a guy who
got a call out two weeks ago.

17:55.120 --> 17:59.000
He remembered it
because he thought the husband
was acting very shifty.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.840
He's just getting me
the details.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.520
First girl I ever kissed
had the same initials.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.280
Leonie Brennan.
Terrifying she was.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.160
I spent the whole of
primary school
living in fear of her.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.080
God, I hope it's not her.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.440
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.400
Okay.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.400
Well, thank you
for your help. Bye.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.880
So the owner of the house
is a Charles Blake.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.280
I'll check the register.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.760
He's lived on Saint Marie
for five years.

18:33.840 --> 18:39.080
Other residents at the address
are his wife, Lucy Blake.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.720
L.B.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.560
But if their house was burgled,
why didn't they report it?

18:44.640 --> 18:45.920
Well, they say the only time

18:46.000 --> 18:48.040
people don't like involving
the police in a crime...

18:48.120 --> 18:51.280
Is when those people
are criminals themselves.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.120
Exactly. See if Mr Blake
has a record, would you?

18:59.240 --> 19:01.320
Whoa. Look at this.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.560
Who's been
a naughty boy, then?

19:03.640 --> 19:06.400
It's the police, love.
I'll deal with it.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.920
Don't worry. You stay there.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.280
Morning.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.240
Apologies for the attire.
(CHUCKLES)

19:13.320 --> 19:14.760
I've been hitting the treadmill.

19:14.840 --> 19:19.200
Always try and fit in 5K
before breakfast if I can.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.920
Well, you're a better man
than me, Mr Blake.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.080
The most I ever manage
before breakfast

19:24.160 --> 19:25.960
-is a trip to the bathroom.
-(LAUGHS)

19:26.040 --> 19:30.520
So how can I be of service
to the local constabulary
this morning?

19:31.680 --> 19:33.080
Do you recognise this?

19:37.760 --> 19:40.040
Ah, it's Lucy's necklace.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.880
-Where did you find it?
-At a crime scene
earlier this morning.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.240
JACK: With quite a selection
of other pieces of jewellery

19:45.320 --> 19:46.560
and some gents watches.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.680
Now, I was just
wondering if maybe

19:48.760 --> 19:51.560
they might belong to yourself
and Mrs Blake, as well?

19:51.640 --> 19:53.280
I couldn't tell you
without seeing them.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.920
Oh, so you are missing more
than just this one item
at the moment?

19:57.800 --> 20:01.200
We had a break-in
a couple of weeks ago.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.040
They helped themselves
to my watch collection

20:03.120 --> 20:04.960
and, er,
two of Lucy's jewellery cases.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.400
She was gutted, poor lamb.

20:06.480 --> 20:10.000
And you didn't think to call
the police to deal with it?

20:10.080 --> 20:12.440
Entre nous I'd never
actually got the stuff insured,

20:12.520 --> 20:15.120
so a crime number was
never gonna do me much good.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.720
(WHISPERS)
But don't tell Lucy that, eh?

20:16.800 --> 20:19.280
Sir, if you don't
mind me asking,
how much was it all worth?

20:19.360 --> 20:20.840
The jewellery, the watches.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.320
Well, couldn't tell you
off the top of me head.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.240
I mean, I'm no Louis Cartier,

20:25.320 --> 20:28.040
but I imagine that little lot
set you back a bob or two.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.560
What are we talking,
60, 70 grand maybe?

20:31.680 --> 20:33.960
My property that got stolen,
Inspector,

20:34.040 --> 20:36.400
so how I choose to deal with it
is up to me.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.360
You see, that's
what worries me, Charlie.

20:39.440 --> 20:42.920
The person who was found
in possession of it
had been murdered.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.120
You don't think
it's me what done it?

20:47.200 --> 20:50.640
-We checked
your criminal record.
-I was shocked, frankly.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.960
Armed robbery, assault,
numerous spells in prison.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.600
And now I'm retired.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.080
-I don't do that any more.
-JACK: Maybe.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.680
But I can't help thinking if a
man like you gets ripped off,

21:01.760 --> 21:06.440
then something tells me
you're not going to take that
lying down, are you?

21:06.520 --> 21:10.440
For the record, where were you
between 10:00 and 11:00
last night?

21:10.520 --> 21:12.880
I was in bed, asleep.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.120
With Mrs Blake?

21:15.400 --> 21:18.360
As it happens,
I was alone, actually.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.080
Lucy was out with
the girls last night.

21:20.160 --> 21:23.600
Yeah. So, to be clear, Charlie,

21:23.680 --> 21:27.000
you don't have an alibi for the
time our victim was murdered?

21:27.080 --> 21:30.040
No, Inspector, I don't.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.600
-(DWAYNE GRUNTS)
-Morning.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.000
Dwayne. JP.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.840
Darlene.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.320
-So how's my birthday boy today?
-(CHUCKLES)

21:49.400 --> 21:52.080
All the better for
seeing you, Darlene.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.640
I take it we're still on
for dinner this evening?

21:54.720 --> 21:58.160
Well, I should hope so.
I've already bought
all the ingredients.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.360
-Oh?
-Your favourite.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.520
-Mmm.
-Creole spiced ribs.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.480
DWAYNE: Oh, Lord.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.480
So, are you on
the job right now,

22:05.560 --> 22:07.560
or am I allowed to give you
a little birthday kiss?

22:07.640 --> 22:11.040
Well, funny you should say that.
You just catch me on a break.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.040
(CHUCKLES) Er...

22:15.120 --> 22:17.360
That evidence isn't going
to lug itself, you know.

22:17.440 --> 22:20.040
Yes, of course.
Bye-bye, Darlene.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.320
CORDELL: Hello?

22:32.360 --> 22:33.920
Is anybody there?

22:34.000 --> 22:35.840
Can I get some water, please?

22:35.920 --> 22:37.120
(SIGHS)

22:44.520 --> 22:46.440
I suppose you're
enjoying all this?

22:53.560 --> 22:55.400
As far as I'm concerned,

22:55.480 --> 22:59.040
the sooner this is over with
and you're out of here,
the better.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.360
Everything okay, gents?

23:06.560 --> 23:07.920
Everything's fine, sir.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.760
Tell me,
do you recognise this fella?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.720
His name is Charlie Blake.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.920
Never heard of him. Who is he?

23:22.000 --> 23:25.120
The gear that Eugene
asked to shift belongs
to this man and his wife.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.680
What is this?

23:26.760 --> 23:29.040
What's going on?
Why haven't you charged me yet?

23:29.120 --> 23:31.480
Because I don't think you're
telling us the truth, Cordell.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.240
I think you're covering
for someone.

23:34.320 --> 23:38.160
You know, right now,
stuck in this cell,
I wish that were true.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.720
But I'm afraid you are
wasting your time, Inspector.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.920
There is no one else involved.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.840
Sir, post-mortem and
lab results are in.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.560
-I have a print-out for you.
-Oh, thank you, Florence.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.280
Oh, I almost forgot, Dwayne.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.720
A little bird
by the name of Darlene
tells me it's your birthday.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.800
Why didn't you say?

23:59.880 --> 24:01.320
Well, you know me, Chief,

24:01.400 --> 24:04.640
I'm not one to, er,
blow my own birthday trumpet.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.800
-Well, happy birthday, anyway.
-Thank you, Chief.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.080
-Yes, happy birthday!
-Thank you, Sergeant.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.760
Love to buy you a drink,
only I hear you got plans.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.520
Well, I can still fit
one in before I have dinner
with Darlene, you know.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.240
Only if there's time now.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.680
There's always time.

24:20.480 --> 24:23.440
Right. Let's see if any of this
backs up our thinking.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.080
So the pathologist confirmed

24:25.160 --> 24:27.480
the time of death to be just
after 10:00 last night.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.160
Which is when both Cordell and
the neighbours say it happened.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.920
Small traces of blood
found on the ornament

24:32.000 --> 24:34.080
confirmed this to be
the weapon.

24:34.160 --> 24:37.280
-Partial fingerprints recovered.
-And who did they belong to?

24:38.720 --> 24:40.440
Cordell Thomas.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.920
As well as Cordell being caught
at the crime scene,

24:43.000 --> 24:44.480
and then confessing he did it,

24:44.560 --> 24:47.200
we now also have a time of death
that matches his

24:47.280 --> 24:48.680
and the neighbour's statements.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.840
Plus, his prints are
on the murder weapon.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.120
I know, JP.
Every single piece of evidence
we've uncovered so far

24:54.200 --> 24:55.760
points to Cordell
as our killer.

24:55.840 --> 24:57.560
So maybe he is then, sir.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.800
(SIGHS) Florence, how are
you getting on?

24:59.880 --> 25:02.000
FLORENCE:
I've been going through
the victim's finances

25:02.080 --> 25:04.520
and Eugene was struggling
to make ends meet.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.560
Might also explain
the sub-standard
quality of his silky jim-jams.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.000
Er, you know what, Chief?

25:10.080 --> 25:12.200
If our victim was trying
to sell that stuff,

25:12.280 --> 25:14.720
maybe I should have
a word with Jimmy the Fence.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.800
-Why not? Give him a bell?
-Will do.

25:16.880 --> 25:19.480
Also, sir, I found
a monthly payment

25:19.560 --> 25:21.600
for a lock-up Eugene rents
down by the beach.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.160
-Might be worth
us taking a look.
-Ah, good thinking.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.280
How did you fellas
get on at Cordell's flat?

25:26.360 --> 25:28.400
It looked like Cordell didn't
use it very much, sir.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.320
I think Eugene had him
working long hours.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.960
We also spoke to
a couple of his neighbours

25:32.040 --> 25:34.480
and they confirmed
exactly what JP said earlier.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.080
The man is a total loner.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.920
Which makes me start to wonder.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.280
How can the guy
be covering for someone
if he doesn't even know anyone?

25:40.360 --> 25:42.680
We did find this, sir.
Cordell's address book.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.080
There's not many
names inside it,

25:44.160 --> 25:45.840
but I'll phone around
the few that's there.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.640
-Mmm.
-FLORENCE: Sir.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.760
Key to Eugene's lock-up.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.040
Lead the way, Detective.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.160
(METAL CLANKING)

25:58.440 --> 26:00.440
Wow, look at all this stuff.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.000
A man of taste.

26:05.320 --> 26:06.280
Florence.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.440
Okay, I'll speak
to the man outside.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.840
See if he saw anything.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.200
Hello, sir. Can I ask you
some questions, please?

26:19.280 --> 26:21.480
MAN: Yes, Officer.
FLORENCE: Do you
often work here?

26:24.280 --> 26:25.960
Well, don't mind if I do.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.840
Serves you right for trying
to steal a dead man's cookies.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.640
All right, what have we got?

26:40.120 --> 26:41.480
Okay. Thank you.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.840
Sir, that was
really interesting.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.520
He said yesterday
he was working on his boat,

26:49.600 --> 26:52.280
when he heard shouting
coming from inside this lock-up.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.400
When he looked,
Eugene's sister was there.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.720
She was furious.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.880
He couldn't make out
what it was all about,

26:58.960 --> 27:01.760
but when she left, she said
Eugene hadn't heard
the last of it.

27:01.840 --> 27:05.880
I am not going to be driven out
of my own place!

27:05.960 --> 27:08.520
Well, I think I might know
what it was about.

27:08.600 --> 27:11.280
Look at these. This is where
Eugene keeps all his paperwork.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.440
He was selling the cafe.

27:14.520 --> 27:17.680
Although Eugene
owns the restaurant, it seems
like Celeste runs the show.

27:17.760 --> 27:19.400
So if he decided to sell it...

27:19.480 --> 27:21.480
Yeah, I imagine she wouldn't be
too happy about it.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.600
Wow.
This place is really something.

27:32.320 --> 27:33.560
This your mum?

27:33.640 --> 27:36.040
-Lily was it?
-Yes.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.440
I imagine she was the life
and soul of the place.
Am I right?

27:38.520 --> 27:39.520
Mmm.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.040
Oh, take a seat.

27:41.840 --> 27:44.840
Yes, she was a good hostess.

27:46.200 --> 27:50.360
Made every night feel special,

27:50.440 --> 27:51.920
like a party.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.440
And from what I gather,
Eugene was cut
from the same cloth.

27:56.120 --> 28:00.440
They both had
a certain charisma.

28:00.520 --> 28:03.560
When your mother died,
she left the business to Eugene.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.880
-He was younger than you.
-Mmm-hmm.

28:05.960 --> 28:09.200
Why not leave it
to you, Celeste? Seems it's
you who does all the work.

28:10.680 --> 28:11.960
Eugene was her favourite.

28:13.240 --> 28:16.160
But though it was Eugene's name
on the deeds,

28:16.240 --> 28:19.800
it's my heart that beats
inside this place.

28:19.880 --> 28:23.120
Oh, that's plain to see.
No doubt about that.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.440
So then, how did you feel

28:26.520 --> 28:29.680
about the fact that Eugene was
planning to sell the restaurant?

28:32.280 --> 28:33.800
Ha. I, er...

28:35.600 --> 28:37.160
I only found out yesterday.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.280
Eugene never showed
any interest in this place.

28:41.360 --> 28:44.280
Always too busy
pursuing his other ventures,

28:44.360 --> 28:46.240
as he liked to call them.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.600
But all it ever did
was brought him more debt.

28:48.680 --> 28:49.960
So what were you
going to do about it?

28:51.400 --> 28:53.640
There is nothing I can do.

28:53.720 --> 28:57.000
We know you had an argument
with Eugene yesterday
at his lock-up.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.280
Sounds like you got
pretty worked up there, Celeste.

29:03.640 --> 29:07.160
From the moment
that child was born,

29:07.240 --> 29:10.720
Eugene had not a single ounce
of common sense
in that head of his.

29:12.160 --> 29:13.520
Mama didn't care.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.880
"He has spirit", she'd say.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.920
But what good is spirit

29:20.000 --> 29:22.400
if you don't have the gumption
to go with it?

29:24.160 --> 29:25.440
I admit it,

29:27.200 --> 29:29.160
I disliked my brother.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.600
And I would have gladly
murdered him

29:32.680 --> 29:34.800
for what he planned to do
to this restaurant.

29:36.800 --> 29:37.960
Except that she...

29:39.520 --> 29:41.280
Mama would never
have forgiven me.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.600
And unlike Eugene,

29:44.680 --> 29:48.560
I at least have some respect
for my mother's memory.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.640
Where were you last night
around ten o'clock?

29:51.720 --> 29:55.360
I was here,
cleaning up after service.

29:55.440 --> 29:56.760
Anyone vouch for that?

29:58.480 --> 29:59.560
I was alone.

30:02.480 --> 30:05.640
(SIGHS) But sir,
if Celeste killed Eugene,

30:05.720 --> 30:08.000
why would Cordell agree
to cover for her?

30:08.080 --> 30:11.240
When me and Dwayne
spoke to her earlier, she said
she didn't even trust the guy.

30:11.320 --> 30:14.040
It's a fair point, JP. I don't
quite have an answer yet.

30:14.120 --> 30:17.240
FLORENCE: And it's the
same problem with our
first suspect, Charlie Blake.

30:17.320 --> 30:20.200
We can't find a strong
enough connection between him
and Cordell.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.920
Also true. Thank you, Florence.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.320
So, we only have
two possible suspects.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.960
And in both cases,
there's absolutely no reason

30:29.040 --> 30:31.040
for Cordell to take the blame
for any of them.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.800
Again, spot on.
Much appreciated.

30:33.880 --> 30:36.640
Dwayne, JP, I don't suppose
you found anything

30:36.720 --> 30:39.440
to support my theory
that Cordell might be innocent?

30:39.520 --> 30:41.560
Dwayne, what about
Jimmy the Fence?
Was he any help?

30:41.640 --> 30:43.640
Still waiting for him
to call me back.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.400
(SIGHS) JP, what about
Cordell's address book?

30:46.480 --> 30:48.880
-Did you manage to
speak to any of them?
-All of them, sir.

30:48.960 --> 30:52.040
Mostly older friends
who said they've hardly seen
Cordell in the last year.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.920
What about his phone records?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.280
Well, he has no
registered accounts with any
of the island's networks.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.120
He must have used a pay
as you go phone
and disposed of it.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.960
Because we didn't find one
at the crime scene
or at his flat.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.360
Maybe he ditched it
before he handed himself in?

31:07.440 --> 31:09.560
Well, that could help.
Because you'd only ditch a phone

31:09.640 --> 31:11.640
if there was something
on it you didn't want
the police to find.

31:11.720 --> 31:15.080
But how are we going
to find that, sir? It could
be anywhere on the island.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.600
Hmm. Hmm.

31:17.360 --> 31:18.960
So the truth is

31:19.040 --> 31:22.280
Cordell leads an isolated life
with few, if any, friends.

31:22.360 --> 31:23.880
Which makes it hard to believe

31:23.960 --> 31:26.120
there's anyone he
could be protecting,
even if he wanted to.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.720
On top of which, every single
piece of evidence we have so far

31:28.800 --> 31:31.400
points firmly to him
as the guilty party.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.800
-Apart from the peanut.
-Apart from the peanut.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.360
All right,
let's take a breather.
Clear the heads.

31:40.520 --> 31:41.960
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

31:53.360 --> 31:55.400
Here, sir,
I made you a cup of tea.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.240
I thought you looked like
you could use one.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.880
Ah, that's very thoughtful, JP.

31:59.960 --> 32:03.320
No situation can't be remedied
by a nice hot cup of cha.

32:06.200 --> 32:09.160
-Sir, can I ask you something?
-Of course you can.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.640
Well, that peanut,

32:11.720 --> 32:14.200
is that the only reason
why you're convinced
Cordell is innocent?

32:16.040 --> 32:17.840
I'll tell you what, JP,

32:17.920 --> 32:21.160
I'll answer your question
on the proviso that you
answer one for me.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.400
-Deal?
-Deal.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.600
What's your question?

32:25.880 --> 32:27.880
Cordell Thomas.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.920
Why are you
so convinced he's guilty?

32:31.000 --> 32:34.040
There's more going on here
than just an old face
from the past, isn't there?

32:37.840 --> 32:41.800
Cordell wasn't
a very nice person at school.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.840
You know?

32:43.920 --> 32:46.400
In fact, he was very nasty, sir.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.040
Bullied people, bullied me.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.000
Sorry to hear that.

32:52.920 --> 32:54.640
Yeah, must have been tough.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.800
What age were you
when this happened?

32:56.880 --> 33:00.440
I was 11. Lasted about a year.

33:00.520 --> 33:04.240
I mean, I was small for my age
and easy to pick on.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.080
Because I didn't
ever put up a fight.

33:07.160 --> 33:10.840
I think Cordell, well,
he realised he could do
whatever he wanted to me.

33:10.920 --> 33:13.440
So he did.

33:13.520 --> 33:18.040
What I saw inside him then,
you know, looking into his eyes,

33:18.120 --> 33:20.680
as he picked on me
and pushed me around,

33:22.800 --> 33:24.520
I don't think that
just leaves you.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.200
Anyway, your turn.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.280
Oh, yeah. The peanut.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.680
Yeah.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.200
My old man was a copper.
Did I ever tell you that?

33:38.280 --> 33:40.360
Er, no. A detective like you?

33:40.440 --> 33:42.560
No, no, no, no.
Strictly uniform.

33:42.640 --> 33:45.600
But he was good, you know.
Had a nose for it.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.080
And he used to say,

33:48.160 --> 33:51.840
"You know the truth not just
by the reason,
but also by the heart."

33:51.920 --> 33:54.640
Now I guess
that's how I feel about Cordell.

33:54.720 --> 33:57.600
There's something in here
telling me that he didn't do it.

33:58.880 --> 34:00.960
So, no,
it wasn't just about the peanut.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.040
But what can you do
about instinct

34:05.120 --> 34:07.880
when all the physical evidence
is solidly stacked against you?

34:09.040 --> 34:10.400
(SIGHS)

34:10.480 --> 34:12.160
I'm running out of options, JP.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.920
You know what, sir?

34:17.000 --> 34:18.920
I think I know
what we need to do.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.720
JACK: Florence.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.600
JP and I have just had
an impromptu case conference
out on the veranda.

34:23.680 --> 34:25.320
And well, the upshot is

34:25.400 --> 34:27.640
we've decided to work
through the night
to try and crack this one.

34:27.720 --> 34:29.120
If that's the plan, then I'm in.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.920
Which means the pressure is on

34:31.000 --> 34:33.520
because we've got
less than ten hours before
we have to charge Cordell.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.120
Thank you, Jimmy.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.680
-Is that your man,
Jimmy the Fence?
-Oh, yes.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.320
About two weeks ago,
Jimmy got wind on the grapevine,

34:39.400 --> 34:42.120
that one of the local thieves
had burgled
Charlie Blake's house.

34:42.200 --> 34:43.480
FLORENCE: Did he say who it was?

34:43.560 --> 34:45.520
That was the only thing
I couldn't get out of him.

34:45.600 --> 34:49.240
As soon as that thieving
little toe rag realised
whose house he'd broken into,

34:49.320 --> 34:51.240
he started to sweat
like a hot banana.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.800
He didn't want a man
like Charlie Blake on his back.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.120
So what did he do?

34:55.200 --> 34:56.880
Well, he went to find someone
to sell the gear to.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.400
And in steps the unwitting
Eugene Jones, I take it?

34:59.480 --> 35:01.480
Exactly. So anyway,

35:01.560 --> 35:05.920
Jimmy then heard
that Charlie Blake was
kicking and screaming

35:06.000 --> 35:08.080
running up and down
asking everybody if they

35:08.160 --> 35:09.600
knew who had his gear.

35:09.680 --> 35:12.200
So Charlie wasn't agreeing
to just let go of it?

35:12.280 --> 35:13.960
(CHUCKLES)
You better believe it.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.960
Apparently, he was fuming
saying that he was
going to make sure

35:18.040 --> 35:21.560
whoever had stolen his stuff
was going to suffer.

35:21.640 --> 35:25.640
I think it's time you and I
had another little chat
with Mr Blake.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.040
And why don't you fellas
pop back to the victim's house?

35:28.120 --> 35:29.440
Give it another search.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.400
And see if you can
speak to the neighbour again.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.520
See if there's anything at all
he forgot to tell us.

35:33.600 --> 35:36.440
Er, with all due respect, Chief,
it's getting a bit late,

35:36.520 --> 35:39.800
and some of us have places
we need to be, remember?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.520
Oh, your birthday dinner.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.240
I am so sorry, Dwayne.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.160
You go on. We can manage.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.720
-If you're sure it's okay.
-Yeah, go on. Enjoy yourself.

35:47.800 --> 35:48.960
Thank you, Chief.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.280
(SNIFFING)

35:54.120 --> 35:56.920
You know, Florence,
maybe I should change
my shirt first.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Still smells of fish.
What do you think?

36:00.640 --> 36:02.320
Yeah.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.560
You know what the
hardest thing is about
being a detective, Charlie?

36:06.200 --> 36:07.640
No.

36:07.720 --> 36:10.200
But I get the feeling
you're going to tell me.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.160
It's having the faith
to trust your instincts.

36:12.240 --> 36:15.080
Because it's abstract,
intangible.

36:15.160 --> 36:18.440
Nothing more than a feeling
in your guts telling you
something's wrong.

36:18.520 --> 36:19.720
Your point?

36:19.800 --> 36:22.320
Earlier today, I had
the same feeling about you.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.080
And I was right to trust it.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.560
We have a witness who claims

36:25.640 --> 36:28.480
you were threatening revenge
on whoever had your jewellery.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.080
The next thing, the man in
possession of it turns up dead.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.760
Now are you telling me
that's just a coincidence?

36:34.880 --> 36:38.680
I'll be brief, Inspector,
'cause I've had
my valuable time wasted.

36:38.760 --> 36:42.760
You're right. I was looking
to get my jewellery back.

36:42.840 --> 36:46.760
And if I found whoever had it,
there were going
to be consequences.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.400
However, things
never got that far.

36:49.480 --> 36:53.880
Because it now seems
someone beat me to it.

36:55.560 --> 36:58.280
And anything to prove to us
that it wasn't you who did it?

36:58.360 --> 36:59.760
Nothing!

36:59.840 --> 37:02.440
But if your instinct's as good
as you seem to think it is,

37:02.520 --> 37:04.120
then why don't we
let that be the judge?

37:07.560 --> 37:11.960
I didn't do it, Inspector.

37:18.440 --> 37:19.680
(EXHALES)

37:19.760 --> 37:23.880
Well, as the English
would say, blimey.

37:23.960 --> 37:24.960
Blimey indeed.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.080
Hmm. Oh.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.080
It's your birthday,
so help yourself to
as much as you want.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.680
Oh, yes.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.240
Been waiting for this
all day, you know.

37:41.320 --> 37:42.480
(CHUCKLES)

37:43.520 --> 37:45.480
I thought I'd nearly
have to cancel.

37:45.560 --> 37:46.840
-Oh?
-Yeah.

37:46.920 --> 37:49.800
See, we've got this case.
Really baffling, you know.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.920
So the Chief wanted us
to work up all night.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.360
But my very own boy in blue
managed to solve it
just in time, eh?

37:56.440 --> 37:59.720
If I had, they wouldn't still be
up there working on it now.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.040
I reckon they'll be up there
for most of the night.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.040
But anyway,
so the Chief said to me,

38:05.120 --> 38:08.560
"Look, it's your birthday.
Go and enjoy yourself."

38:08.640 --> 38:10.160
So here I am.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.760
Er, is something wrong,
Darlene?

38:16.840 --> 38:20.480
So you have hot-footed
it up here to stuff your face?

38:20.560 --> 38:22.240
You better believe it.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.240
While the rest of
your poor colleagues
are working through the night

38:24.320 --> 38:25.920
to bring justice
to this island.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.280
But it's my birthday!

38:31.320 --> 38:33.720
-Here, caffeine
it'll do you good.
-Thank you.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.600
I mean, it probably won't
in the long run,

38:35.680 --> 38:37.080
but it might stop us
from nodding off.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.000
FLORENCE: Mmm.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.040
So, Charlie Blake.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.680
I hate to say this sir, but...

38:43.760 --> 38:46.160
(SIGHS) You think
he's telling the truth.

38:46.240 --> 38:49.080
Maybe we've had our murderer
locked up in that cell
all along.

38:55.280 --> 38:58.360
Cordell, he had
a coffee with him.

38:58.440 --> 39:03.080
Sir, if you were going
to hand yourself in to
the police to protect someone,

39:03.160 --> 39:05.760
what's the last thing you'd do?

39:05.840 --> 39:10.480
Er, let the person
I was protecting know
that's what I was doing.

39:10.560 --> 39:13.400
So what,
you think Cordell phoned
whoever it is he's covering for

39:13.480 --> 39:15.080
before handing himself in?

39:15.160 --> 39:18.320
Hmm. But it's like JP said,
the phone could be anywhere.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.720
Except I remembered
he had a takeaway coffee.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.200
It was 6:00 in the morning
when he got to the station

39:23.280 --> 39:25.800
and there's only one place open
at that time in Honore.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.000
The bakery.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.840
He must have bought it
before he came to us.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.520
Cordell knows he has to
make one last call before
he gives himself up.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.840
So, he goes and buys a coffee,
phones whoever it is

39:44.760 --> 39:46.160
and then...

39:46.240 --> 39:49.920
Bins the phone and he makes
his way to the police station.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.200
That's the route you'd take
from the bakery to the station.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.080
We need to check every bin
along that route.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.760
Dwayne, what are you doing here?

39:59.840 --> 40:01.760
Well, I couldn't enjoy myself

40:01.840 --> 40:04.120
knowing my colleagues were
still working on the case.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.120
So I came to help.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.200
-Darlene told you to,
didn't she?
-No, she didn't.

40:10.800 --> 40:13.200
Though she's a very intimidating
woman when she wants to be.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.080
Yeah, well,
you're just in time,

40:15.160 --> 40:17.560
because we need to
search every bin from the
bakery to the police station.

40:17.640 --> 40:19.800
Seriously? Bin duty?

40:20.520 --> 40:21.880
But it's my birthday.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.760
And you didn't see anybody
at all while you were
waiting for us to arrive?

40:27.840 --> 40:30.560
I would have told you if I had.

40:30.640 --> 40:33.440
And there's no else in the house
that might have seen something?

40:33.520 --> 40:34.840
No.

40:34.920 --> 40:37.880
Been just me here
for a few years now,

40:39.320 --> 40:41.000
since my wife passed.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.360
I'm sorry to hear that,
Mr Palmer.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.480
Is that her over there?

40:49.280 --> 40:50.880
That is my Bessie.

40:52.520 --> 40:55.560
Wow. You both look very happy.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.160
We were.

40:58.480 --> 41:01.800
You know, between us,

41:01.880 --> 41:06.640
I used to be a bit of
a wild thing back in
the day, you know.

41:06.720 --> 41:10.400
Different girl every night.

41:10.480 --> 41:14.720
But then, this one come along
and something changed.

41:14.800 --> 41:19.160
Like everything
suddenly made sense in life.

41:19.240 --> 41:20.480
Of course it did.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.040
Maybe Cordell has changed
since you knew him.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.840
You all right, son?

41:27.880 --> 41:29.920
Er, yes.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.800
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.240
Come back again.

41:42.080 --> 41:43.560
Sir?

41:43.640 --> 41:46.040
I got it wrong.

41:46.120 --> 41:48.200
I got this whole thing
wrong, sir.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.240
-Got what wrong?
-Cordell.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.280
All this time, sir,
I was sure it was him.

41:52.360 --> 41:55.080
But it's like what
Mr Palmer says,
something changed.

41:55.160 --> 41:56.520
You've lost me, JP.

41:56.600 --> 41:59.080
Okay, think about everything
we've learned about Cordell.

41:59.160 --> 42:00.880
Okay, he stopped
seeing his friends,

42:00.960 --> 42:03.920
he was spending hardly any time
in his own flat.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.560
Sir, that's what happens
when you meet a girl.

42:06.640 --> 42:09.240
That's what I was like
when I first
started seeing Rosey.

42:09.320 --> 42:12.120
I mean, the man
even got himself a job, sir.

42:13.320 --> 42:16.040
Cordell, was settling down.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.360
-You mean he's got a girlfriend?
-Yes, sir.

42:18.440 --> 42:20.320
And I think it's her
he's protecting.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.160
All we have to do now, sir,
is find out who she is.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.200
Sir, wrapped up
in an old newspaper.

42:25.280 --> 42:26.720
Good work, Detective Sergeant.

42:26.800 --> 42:30.600
Last number dialled
was at 5:32 a.m.
yesterday morning.

42:30.680 --> 42:32.720
Twenty minutes before
Cordell handed himself in.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.240
-Someone called Marie.
-Marie?

42:35.320 --> 42:37.200
Looks like you
got this right, JP.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.240
But who's Marie?

42:40.800 --> 42:42.000
The caretaker.

42:44.320 --> 42:48.000
Okay, first, we get Cordell
to revoke his statement

42:48.080 --> 42:49.880
and tell us exactly
what's going on.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.360
And if we're right about this,

42:51.440 --> 42:53.400
then we'll have to go
and arrest the girlfriend.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.360
I saved you the time.
You can arrest me now.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.720
Is anybody else here
getting a touch of deja vu?

43:07.400 --> 43:09.160
(CELL DOOR RATTLES)

43:15.480 --> 43:17.000
Cordell, from the
start of this case

43:17.080 --> 43:20.440
I struggled to believe
that you killed Eugene Jones.

43:20.520 --> 43:23.360
I thought you were
covering for someone.
And I was right, wasn't I?

43:24.920 --> 43:26.480
That's right.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.920
He didn't break into
Eugene's house
to steal the jewellery.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.320
He went there to help me.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.960
Because I killed Eugene.

43:35.040 --> 43:39.640
About a week ago,
Eugene did ask me
to sell some stolen goods,

43:39.720 --> 43:40.840
but I told him no,

43:40.920 --> 43:43.360
I didn't do that any more.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.480
MARIE:
Cordell told me what happened.

43:45.560 --> 43:48.000
And I told him
he did the right thing.

43:48.080 --> 43:50.960
But I knew
how much we could use the money,

43:51.040 --> 43:53.200
so I thought I could
sell it meself as a one off.

43:53.280 --> 43:55.120
Cordell need never know.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.760
After a couple of days,
I'd already sold about
a quarter of the stuff.

43:57.840 --> 44:02.560
But then, one of
the market traders told me
some man was asking around.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.560
And that he heard I was selling
his stuff and he wanted it back.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.360
Charlie Blake was on to you.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.680
Apparently he was making
some nasty threats.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.040
FLORENCE: So what did you do?

44:12.080 --> 44:13.800
The night before last,

44:13.880 --> 44:17.000
I went around Eugene's
to hand over the money I made.

44:17.080 --> 44:19.960
And I told him I was scared
about this Charlie Blake

44:20.040 --> 44:21.640
and he just shrugged.

44:21.720 --> 44:24.440
Told me I'd been careless
and it was my problem.

44:24.520 --> 44:25.840
So I told Eugene

44:25.920 --> 44:28.400
if he wasn't going to help me,
I'll go to the police.

44:28.480 --> 44:29.800
And he didn't like that.

44:29.880 --> 44:31.640
He started shouting at me.

44:31.720 --> 44:34.160
I tried to leave,
but he wouldn't let me.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.400
You know,
he was holding me back,
hurting me.

44:36.480 --> 44:37.800
And I just wanted to get away,

44:37.880 --> 44:40.080
so I grabbed the ornament
and lashed out.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.640
You hit him?

44:41.720 --> 44:43.520
I went to, but I missed.

44:43.600 --> 44:47.320
And as he stumbled back,
he fell and banged his head
on the coffee table

44:48.840 --> 44:50.240
and just lay there dead.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.840
Which is when
you went to Cordell.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.960
She was in a state.
Hysterical. She...

44:58.040 --> 45:00.040
She could hardly speak.

45:00.120 --> 45:01.520
I said not to worry.

45:02.640 --> 45:03.840
I'll go check it out.

45:05.680 --> 45:07.640
MARIE: Next thing I know,
I get a call from him

45:07.720 --> 45:10.880
telling me I'm to keep quiet,
that he's going
to take the blame.

45:11.960 --> 45:14.000
To protect me, both of us.

45:16.520 --> 45:17.880
Sorry, both of you?

45:25.040 --> 45:26.320
You're pregnant?

45:27.120 --> 45:28.600
Four months.

45:28.680 --> 45:32.160
That's why Cordell did all this.
To stop us going to prison.

45:32.240 --> 45:35.840
That's why it all started.
Why you needed the money.

45:35.920 --> 45:38.400
We wanted to
put a deposit down on a house.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.360
Just wanted to do
the best for our baby.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.000
(KEYS CLINKING)

45:52.960 --> 45:54.840
(CELL DOOR OPENING)

45:55.560 --> 45:56.920
I'm sorry, Cordell.

45:59.400 --> 46:01.920
Truth is, if anybody
should be apologising,
it's me.

46:04.200 --> 46:06.280
I know what I did to you
all those years ago, JP.

46:08.120 --> 46:10.280
(SIGHS)

46:10.360 --> 46:14.160
I get it. Er, we were
different people back then.

46:17.840 --> 46:21.640
Erm, I think I need some air.

46:22.200 --> 46:23.400
Yeah.

46:27.400 --> 46:29.120
No, no, no, no, no, no,

46:29.200 --> 46:30.680
no, no, no, no, no, no.

46:30.760 --> 46:33.600
-Everything okay, sir?
-It makes absolutely no sense.

46:33.680 --> 46:34.760
What doesn't?

46:34.840 --> 46:36.560
If Eugene banged his head
on the coffee table,

46:36.640 --> 46:38.760
then he wouldn't have been found
lying the other way around.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.240
(SIGHS)

46:40.320 --> 46:41.720
And there was blood
on the weapon.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.600
Which, supposedly,
isn't a weapon at all.

46:44.680 --> 46:46.200
So how did that get there?

46:46.280 --> 46:48.800
Marie said she gave Eugene
the money, but we
never found any.

46:48.880 --> 46:52.240
All we found was
this lousy legume.

46:52.320 --> 46:53.880
And ever since,

46:53.960 --> 46:55.880
we've located not
a single other nut
anywhere during this case.

46:55.960 --> 46:59.640
Not in the victim's house,
his restaurant, his lock-up.

46:59.720 --> 47:02.160
That's right. We never found
any nuts in the lock-up.

47:03.320 --> 47:06.200
But there was a cookie jar,
wasn't there?

47:06.280 --> 47:08.520
Except there was no cookies.
Or nuts, for that matter.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.320
Only elastic bands.

47:11.480 --> 47:15.000
No cookies,
no nuts, no money.

47:22.400 --> 47:24.000
The night before last,

47:24.080 --> 47:27.200
I went around Eugene's
to hand over the money I made.

47:27.280 --> 47:31.160
We found jars of rice,
pasta and beans.
None with any nuts in it.

47:31.240 --> 47:33.320
This neighbour called up
about a disturbance.

47:33.400 --> 47:35.720
He was putting out his rubbish
just after midnight.

47:35.800 --> 47:37.440
I was in bed, asleep.

47:37.520 --> 47:40.320
I was here.
Cleaning up after service.

47:43.680 --> 47:45.160
That's it!

47:45.240 --> 47:46.560
(LAUGHING)

47:46.640 --> 47:48.840
Why else would a dead man
be holding a peanut in his hand?

47:48.920 --> 47:50.040
It makes perfect sense.

47:50.120 --> 47:51.600
You want us to round up
all the suspects?

47:51.680 --> 47:53.120
JACK:
It would be churlish not to.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.600
Now, Florence, there's something
I need you to do for me.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.880
-Sir?
-I need you to go on a nut hunt.

47:58.960 --> 48:00.000
Erm...

48:13.680 --> 48:15.600
Enjoying yourself, Inspector?

48:15.680 --> 48:18.880
Very much, Charlie.
And all the more
so for you being here.

48:18.960 --> 48:20.160
So glad you could make it.

48:20.240 --> 48:23.400
Now, two nights ago,
in this very room,

48:23.480 --> 48:26.560
Eugene Jones was murdered
in cold blood.

48:28.280 --> 48:30.160
Now it's important
to take note of that phrase,

48:30.240 --> 48:32.080
because that's
exactly what it was.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.120
In cold blood.

48:34.200 --> 48:37.360
That night, Marie Gayle
pushed Eugene Jones

48:37.440 --> 48:40.240
causing him to fall and bang
his head on the coffee table.

48:42.080 --> 48:44.200
She then turned
to Cordell Thomas,

48:44.280 --> 48:46.840
who, to protect
the women he loved,

48:46.920 --> 48:48.480
admitted to the crime himself.

48:49.320 --> 48:51.680
However, we've come to realise

48:51.760 --> 48:53.400
by the time Cordell
got to the crime scene

48:53.480 --> 48:54.920
and started to clean it up,

48:55.000 --> 48:57.480
there were
significant differences
to how Marie left it.

48:58.720 --> 49:00.520
For a start,

49:00.600 --> 49:04.000
this ornament here had traces
of Eugene's blood on it.

49:05.400 --> 49:07.600
If Eugene died banging his head
on the coffee table,

49:07.680 --> 49:09.760
why was there blood on this?

49:11.280 --> 49:13.640
-And...
-(THUDS)

49:13.720 --> 49:17.440
If Eugene banged
his head on the table

49:17.520 --> 49:20.520
he would have been found
lying with his head here.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.640
So then, why when
he was discovered,

49:23.720 --> 49:26.400
was he facing the opposite way,
lying with his head here?

49:28.360 --> 49:30.280
Doesn't make any sense.

49:30.360 --> 49:33.520
We also know that
between Marie leaving
and Cordell arriving,

49:33.600 --> 49:35.600
a sum of money had gone missing.

49:35.680 --> 49:37.720
How much money was it
you handed over to Eugene?

49:37.800 --> 49:39.280
About $10,000.

49:39.360 --> 49:41.680
Marie, when you gave Eugene
the money you'd made,

49:41.760 --> 49:43.960
-tell me, where did he take it?
-Into the kitchen.

49:44.920 --> 49:46.440
But we searched the kitchen.

49:46.520 --> 49:49.440
Er, we never found any
money there. So where did it go?

49:49.520 --> 49:51.800
-Someone took it.
-Exactly.

49:51.880 --> 49:54.600
The person who murdered
Eugene Jones took it.

49:58.760 --> 50:00.720
And now I can finally reveal

50:00.800 --> 50:04.320
our thief, our murderer

50:06.680 --> 50:10.120
isn't one of you four
in this room right now.

50:12.600 --> 50:13.720
(EXHALES)

50:15.440 --> 50:16.800
It is in fact
Eugene's neighbour,

50:16.880 --> 50:18.760
Samuel Palmer.

50:18.840 --> 50:21.240
I have a feeling
that could be him right now.

50:21.320 --> 50:23.800
-(DOOR CLOSES)
-Where's Samuel?

50:23.880 --> 50:25.240
He wasn't there, sir.

50:25.320 --> 50:27.440
All his clothes are gone
and so is the money.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.680
Dwayne, JP, alert all the ports
and search his house.

50:29.760 --> 50:31.960
See if you can find any clues
as to where he might be gone.

50:32.040 --> 50:33.000
Yes, Chief.

50:35.280 --> 50:37.440
Lost your culprit, Inspector?

50:37.520 --> 50:39.720
MARIE: I don't understand.
How could Samuel kill Eugene?

50:39.800 --> 50:41.000
It was me that pushed him.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.560
Well, from the outset,

50:42.640 --> 50:45.600
everything that Cordell told us
made sense of the crime scene.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.160
Except for one thing.

50:47.240 --> 50:49.840
This peanut.

50:49.920 --> 50:52.520
We found it in the victim's
closed right hand.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.440
So what was it doing there?

50:54.520 --> 50:56.000
Well, I think you'll
find the answer

50:56.080 --> 50:58.360
lies in that kitchen
with the missing money.

50:58.440 --> 51:02.920
All these jars full of rice
and pasta, beans, flour.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.520
None of then contained nuts.

51:04.600 --> 51:06.600
So we assumed

51:06.680 --> 51:08.600
that Eugene never had any nuts
in the house.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.760
But once I knew
something had gone missing,

51:12.840 --> 51:15.680
specifically a stash of cash,

51:15.760 --> 51:18.560
well, then,
maybe Eugene's jar of peanuts
had gone missing as well.

51:19.520 --> 51:21.760
We found it in
Mr Palmer's house.

51:21.840 --> 51:24.040
In the cupboard
underneath his sink.

51:24.120 --> 51:27.280
And just as a cookie jar
can contain nothing
but elastic bands,

51:28.040 --> 51:29.960
so, too, a jar of peanuts

51:30.040 --> 51:32.680
can contain
a big load of money.

51:32.760 --> 51:36.160
This is where Eugene
kept his cash,

51:36.240 --> 51:38.640
in this tube secreted
amongst the nuts.

51:40.840 --> 51:43.560
This is where he put the $10,000
that you gave him, Marie.

51:43.640 --> 51:47.000
And ultimately, this is what
Samuel killed him for.

51:49.840 --> 51:54.040
So here is the final version
of what happened
the night of the murder,

51:55.040 --> 51:56.960
Shortly after midnight,

51:57.040 --> 51:59.240
Eugene's neighbour Samuel,

51:59.320 --> 52:00.960
he heard arguing.

52:01.040 --> 52:03.440
So as the good neighbour
he was, he came
over to investigate.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.840
On hearing a fairly serious
fight taking place,

52:05.920 --> 52:08.040
he returned to his own house
and he called the police.

52:08.120 --> 52:09.600
Police, please.

52:09.680 --> 52:12.000
Now, while he was doing that,
Marie here,

52:12.080 --> 52:14.720
who Samuel had heard
arguing with Eugene,

52:14.800 --> 52:17.320
panicked and fled
to her boyfriend Cordell.

52:17.400 --> 52:19.480
Now, knowing that the police
were on their way,

52:19.560 --> 52:21.720
I believe that Samuel
came back over here

52:21.800 --> 52:23.720
to see if things
had calmed down a bit.

52:23.800 --> 52:25.040
And finding the door open,

52:25.120 --> 52:26.320
he came inside

52:26.400 --> 52:28.360
and there was Eugene's body
lying on the floor.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.080
What happened? Who did this?

52:30.160 --> 52:33.560
I can only assume while
looking for a first aid kit,

52:33.640 --> 52:37.080
he came across the open jar of
nuts with the money inside it.

52:37.160 --> 52:39.920
Hard to resist the temptation,
so he took it.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.520
And nobody would have known,

52:41.600 --> 52:44.320
except Eugene came around.

52:44.400 --> 52:46.880
And he saw Samuel
with his money.

52:46.960 --> 52:48.760
He must have been furious.

52:48.840 --> 52:50.200
So he tried to stop him
from taking it.

52:50.280 --> 52:52.440
I'm guessing Samuel knew

52:52.520 --> 52:54.840
that Eugene would
tell the police that
he tried to steal it.

52:54.920 --> 52:57.360
Now he didn't
want to go to prison,
he just wanted the money.

52:58.560 --> 53:00.960
So, seeing the
ornament on the floor,

53:01.040 --> 53:03.400
he picked it up and he hit him.

53:03.480 --> 53:06.280
Clever fellow that he was,

53:06.360 --> 53:10.520
he hit him in exactly
the same place Eugene
had already been injured.

53:14.400 --> 53:17.800
The trail would lead back
to the original assailant.

53:17.880 --> 53:21.840
In theory, nobody would ever
have known that he was here.

53:21.920 --> 53:23.760
Which is entirely what happened.

53:23.840 --> 53:24.880
Except for one thing.

53:27.240 --> 53:30.440
While Samuel was busy
shoving the spilled nuts

53:30.520 --> 53:32.160
and the cash back into the jar,

53:32.240 --> 53:33.840
your brother,
in his last dying moment,

53:34.920 --> 53:36.280
put his hand around this.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.320
The one piece of evidence

53:39.400 --> 53:42.040
we had for the entire case
that made no sense.

53:42.120 --> 53:45.640
But ultimately,
please excuse the pun here,

53:45.720 --> 53:47.440
it cracked it
wide open for us.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.320
Hmm.

53:52.520 --> 53:54.080
So I take it you're
done with me?

53:54.160 --> 53:56.120
We are indeed, Charlie.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.600
It's been
an absolute pleasure.

54:01.240 --> 54:03.040
Sorry you didn't
get your man, Inspector.

54:05.120 --> 54:06.080
So, erm,

54:06.800 --> 54:08.040
what happens now?

54:08.120 --> 54:11.360
Well, you'll be facing charges,
the pair of you.

54:11.440 --> 54:14.840
But I would hope
that a forgiving judge will take
your situation into account.

54:17.560 --> 54:18.720
Thank you.

54:21.160 --> 54:22.680
JP, how are you getting on?

54:22.760 --> 54:24.560
Er, sir, I'm afraid
there's nothing in here

54:24.640 --> 54:27.320
that indicates where
Mr Palmer might be.

54:27.400 --> 54:29.240
No address book or laptop.

54:29.320 --> 54:31.240

and paying a fisherman
to use his boat.

He's heading to
one of the other islands.

54:40.360 --> 54:41.560
Any chance
we could catch him?

54:41.640 --> 54:43.240
I've spoken to
the other port authority.

54:43.320 --> 54:44.960
He's heading that way,
so he shouldn't get far.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.200
