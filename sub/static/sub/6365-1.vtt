WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.303
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Is that my husband's child?

00:04.305 --> 00:06.739
Lola:
<i>You were engaged to bash.</i>
<i>If you tell francis,</i>

00:06.741 --> 00:08.741
I essentially
become his.

00:08.743 --> 00:10.142
Greer:
<i>You're a servant.</i>

00:10.144 --> 00:11.510
Nothing can ever happen
between us.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.245
Remember this as the moment
that you threw

00:13.247 --> 00:14.480
Your happiness away.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.715
<i>So let's have that drink now.</i>

00:16.717 --> 00:19.718
Father, my evening took
the loveliest turn.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.488
Guard:
The king is dead!
Long live the king!

00:22.490 --> 00:24.423
Guard 2:
The king is dead!
Long live the king!

00:24.425 --> 00:27.126
Tell me your darkest truth,
and I will tell you mine.

00:27.128 --> 00:30.029
Lola is giving birth.
You are the father of her child.

00:30.031 --> 00:32.031
The time is now. We need
to think like queens.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.799
Mary:
<i>You are going to a village</i>
<i>which has likely been exposed</i>

00:33.801 --> 00:35.601
To plague. You can't leave.

00:35.603 --> 00:36.769
Your friend, my child.

00:36.771 --> 00:38.537
<i>Perhaps my only child.</i>

00:38.539 --> 00:39.505
<i>Listen to your heart</i>
<i>and you will hear it</i>

00:39.507 --> 00:41.340
<i>As clearly as I do.</i>

00:43.543 --> 00:45.811
(horse neighs)

00:51.117 --> 00:53.585
(crows cawing)

00:55.789 --> 00:57.256
(horse neighs)

01:12.572 --> 01:14.406
Mary:
<i>It is upon us now,</i>

01:14.408 --> 01:18.577
<i>An old and faceless foe.</i>

01:18.579 --> 01:22.147
We have confirmed reports that
the black death has returned

01:22.149 --> 01:24.316
Once more to plague our lands.
(gasping, murmuring)

01:24.318 --> 01:27.119
Catherine:
You needn't fear.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.253
Only take care.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.555
Where is our young king?

01:29.557 --> 01:31.557
King francis is safe.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.258
He is protected
in a private home.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.761
You are all protected.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.563
I have ordered the
castle be made secure

01:37.565 --> 01:39.131
To prevent the arrival
of infection.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.800
What if the plague's
already here?

01:41.802 --> 01:43.302
Catherine: Anyone who is sick
will be treated

01:43.304 --> 01:45.104
With dignity
and kindness.

01:45.106 --> 01:48.273
Catherine's being too nice.
What she'll really want

01:48.275 --> 01:50.676
Is the sick rooted out or
turned in by their neighbors.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.112
Catherine: But if you should
feel unwell, we urge you

01:53.114 --> 01:56.281
To seek our expert care.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.183
There are early signs.

01:58.185 --> 02:00.185
Fevers.

02:00.187 --> 02:02.688
The expulsion of blood.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.190
But more commonly, aches, pains,

02:05.192 --> 02:07.159
Bulbous sores that will burst.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.428
The blackening
of extremities. Contact

02:09.430 --> 02:11.530
With others spreads the disease.

02:11.532 --> 02:15.434
Aloysius, is that
your daughter with leith?

02:16.769 --> 02:18.871
Are they together?

02:18.873 --> 02:20.305
It can't be.

02:21.574 --> 02:24.176
I'm not jealous.
I'm worried.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.444
Why is that?

02:25.446 --> 02:28.747
Leith made a sort of vow
when things ended.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.883
That he'd attain wealth
and station

02:30.885 --> 02:34.453
And that I would be forced to
witness his rise and happiness

02:34.455 --> 02:36.288
With another.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.890
You think that's why he's
sought out my daughter.

02:37.892 --> 02:39.291
Greer:
I don't know.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.560
There. That's
my father,

02:41.562 --> 02:43.629
And that's his fiancÃ©e.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.564
Leith:
That's your father?

02:45.566 --> 02:46.798
I'll be back.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.635
Catherine:
And none have fallen ill

02:49.637 --> 02:52.905
Among us.
The queen can confirm this.

02:52.907 --> 02:56.608
No one at court has shown signs
of the plague, not one.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.544
And I pray none will.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.379
We are prepared,

03:00.381 --> 03:03.715
And we are in the best position
to survive.

03:03.717 --> 03:08.187
(quietly): We are far from
prepared. How could we be?

03:08.189 --> 03:09.388
Where is francis?

03:09.390 --> 03:11.390
I tried to stop him,
but I was too late.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.625
I've sent guards, ones that can
be trusted with the knowledge

03:13.627 --> 03:15.194
That the king
is not safe...
Mary!

03:15.196 --> 03:16.295
Can you tell us
what's happening?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.532
We have taken precautions.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.868
As far as we know,
no one here has gotten sick.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.204
As queen, I will need
to be isolated.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.805
I can't stay with you.
I'm so sorry.

03:26.807 --> 03:27.806
Greer:
Are you all right?

03:27.808 --> 03:29.875
Where is francis, really?

03:29.877 --> 03:30.943
He wouldn't leave you. Not now.

03:30.945 --> 03:33.579
(speaking
indistinctly)

03:33.581 --> 03:36.315
Lola sent word. She's having

03:36.317 --> 03:38.250
The baby.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.319
There are...
Problems with the birth.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.720
Will she be
all right?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.422
I don't know.
All I know

03:43.424 --> 03:47.392
Is that she is my friend,
and francis is my husband.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.262
And god willing, there is
an innocent new life.

03:51.564 --> 03:55.267
I tried to stop him
from going to her

03:55.269 --> 03:56.969
When I found out
about the plague.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.570
But he went anyway.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.439
You were trying
to protect him.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.941
And now I must protect
his people.
Greer: Mary,

04:02.943 --> 04:05.277
Your task is
to survive.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.813
That's what francis
would want.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.315
(indistinct chatter)

04:12.418 --> 04:14.920
When were you going to tell me?
I had no idea

04:14.922 --> 04:17.923
Lord castleroy is your father
until you pointed him out.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.292
But then you were off to him
before I could even stop you.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.327
Off to my father
and his fiancÃ©e.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.496
I met greer just
a few days ago.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.831
I liked her.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.332
It's over.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.967
I wouldn't have pursued you
in any way

04:28.969 --> 04:31.003
If it weren't
or if I'd known who you are.

04:31.005 --> 04:34.973
If you could be with her now,
would you?

04:34.975 --> 04:37.476
I can honestly say I would not.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.845
These could be our last days
on earth.

04:41.381 --> 04:43.482
Spend them with me.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.851
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.953
We could... Hide away somewhere,

04:47.955 --> 04:49.988
Away from
everyone.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.857
Yvette,
this isn't wise.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.626
A rooftop somewhere.
I don't care.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.328
We'll bring food and blankets.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.463
There's things I must do.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.865
Tomorrow then.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.000
I'll find you.
You should be away from others.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.036
If you're exposed, you risk...

05:04.038 --> 05:05.771
I know. I know.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.072
But you can't come
to me at my father's suites.

05:07.074 --> 05:10.409
There's a family,
old friends.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.778
I'll make an excuse to check in
on them and wait for you there.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.313
I don't know, yvette.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.648
I'll send word once I'm there.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.088
(bell tolling)

05:23.090 --> 05:25.324
Bash.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.492
I just spoke
with mary,

05:27.494 --> 05:29.961
And they are isolating people
merely for seeming unwell.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.730
Of course they are.
They have to.

05:31.732 --> 05:35.367
And if anyone is truly ill
with plague, chaos will follow.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.968
There isn't enough food. Not
for every household at court.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.036
Not for the weeks it will take

05:38.038 --> 05:39.604
For the disease
to burn itself out

05:39.606 --> 05:41.006
Or the famine that
will surely follow.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.874
You're not an optimistic fellow,
are you?

05:44.377 --> 05:46.611
I've had food brought
to our chambers,

05:46.613 --> 05:48.513
As much as I could demand
in good conscience.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.616
Kenna, you have to find
pascal and secure yourselves

05:51.618 --> 05:52.851
Until the plague has passed

05:52.853 --> 05:54.086
Or passed us over.

05:54.088 --> 05:56.121
How long will that take?
Weeks.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.356
Maybe longer.

05:57.358 --> 06:00.392
(sighs)
you should go. Now.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.027
I'll find you after I
confer with the kingsguard.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.029
Why you?
Because francis
isn't here,

06:04.031 --> 06:06.031
And I know the chief of the
guards. They're scared, too.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.433
But they need to know they're
accountable for their actions

06:08.435 --> 06:10.736
When this is over.

06:13.373 --> 06:18.443
(panting)

06:26.786 --> 06:28.453
Man:
<i>My wife's going</i>

06:28.455 --> 06:31.857
To be furious.
Some court gathering.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.725
But I'd die without
your company.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.595
So would I.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.399
Man:
Your majesties,

06:40.401 --> 06:41.466
My apologies

06:41.468 --> 06:43.068
For missing
the gathering. I...

06:43.070 --> 06:44.603
Not today, sir.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.879
My lord,
please join us.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.889
(hawk cries)

07:03.891 --> 07:06.525
(horse neighs in distance)

07:10.163 --> 07:11.963
Who are you?

07:11.965 --> 07:13.832
Lola:
Francis.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.201
It's all right. I know him.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.636
You're alive.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.171
Yes.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.540
To my surprise.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.209
So is the child,
thank god.

07:24.211 --> 07:27.145
It's a boy.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.548
You have a son.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.663
(sighs)

07:44.665 --> 07:46.164
And here we are...

07:46.166 --> 07:47.933
(chuckles)
the two of us.

07:51.604 --> 07:55.240
It's been hours.
Why hasn't francis returned?

07:55.242 --> 07:58.243
Speak freely. The king's guards
are sworn to secrecy.

07:58.245 --> 08:01.480
Surely he saw signs of the
plague before he got too far.

08:01.482 --> 08:05.517
And why would he go on
just to help one of your ladies?

08:05.519 --> 08:07.519
And where are the guards
that you sent?

08:07.521 --> 08:09.020
Delayed, clearly,

08:09.022 --> 08:10.555
Or deserted.
Or dead.

08:10.557 --> 08:13.525
(sighs)
(somber music playing)

08:13.527 --> 08:15.594
The music.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.597
That's the signal
that someone has fallen ill.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.099
It's begun.

08:23.035 --> 08:27.639
Less than half a day since
we announced the threat.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.674
Whoever is sick
was already here,

08:29.676 --> 08:31.543
Which means there
will be more to follow.

08:31.545 --> 08:34.179
(sighs)
but the airs near us will be

08:34.181 --> 08:36.515
Burned clean.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.751
It worked for the pope.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.857
Who is it?
Who has fallen ill?

08:45.859 --> 08:48.860
A stablehand.
The sores are already

08:48.862 --> 08:51.196
In evidence. He'll be
dead within a day, two

08:51.198 --> 08:53.131
If his body can endure
the suffering.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.267
I heard you sent guards
for francis.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.302
I asked for volunteers.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.304
As they have not returned,
I would like to volunteer.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.906
Why you?

09:00.908 --> 09:03.008
Because he believes himself
immune to the plague.

09:03.976 --> 09:05.777
The young family you lost.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.546
I've had the misfortune
of living in two regions

09:07.548 --> 09:10.148
Of outbreak. And I should
have died with them,

09:10.150 --> 09:11.750
But I did not.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.953
Lola's letter said
she was at the house

09:14.955 --> 09:17.222
Just north of
the mill?
Yes, but...

09:17.224 --> 09:20.158
There is unrest and many
other dangers besides illness.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.160
And if any
have befallen my son,

09:22.162 --> 09:24.663
Who has risked so much
for your friend...

09:24.665 --> 09:28.767
Unless there's another reason
why he has rushed to her side.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.936
Tell me, mary, is there?
Do not

09:30.938 --> 09:34.239
Taunt me or seek to sew discord.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.007
Not this day.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.578
Nostradamus is willing to risk
his life to save our king,

09:39.580 --> 09:41.813
My husband
and your son.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.748
Thank him and say good-bye.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.654
I order you as your queen,

09:49.656 --> 09:52.357
Show your gratitude
and then grant me your silence.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.094
Thank you,

09:56.096 --> 09:59.598
Nostradamus.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.339
(bell tolling)
pascal.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.341
Pascal, stop. I've been looking
for you for hours.

10:09.343 --> 10:11.343
Come on, we have to go.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.311
The servants seem
to be scattered.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.314
I'm merely asking this
one to help fetch some
food from a larder.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.217
He's no servant-- he's my ward.
I need help.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.952
My wife's taken shelter
with other family.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.988
I'm on my own.
He's coming with me.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.690
It's girls like you
who get men like me

10:25.692 --> 10:26.958
Locked away from our wives

10:26.960 --> 10:28.627
In the first place.
What does that mean?

10:28.629 --> 10:29.661
Whores.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.329
You were the king's whore.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.365
He's dead.
You're nobody now.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.700
I am married
to the current king's brother.

10:35.702 --> 10:36.901
I am a lady.
Queen mary's

10:36.903 --> 10:38.837
Disgraced lady, wed

10:38.839 --> 10:40.839
To the bastard with a
title designed to make

10:40.841 --> 10:43.141
Everyone laugh.
I ought to have you whipped.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.809
I'll do it.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.077
I'll fetch whatever
you need and then

10:46.079 --> 10:47.412
I'll come back to our

10:47.414 --> 10:48.413
Quarters,
all right?

10:50.683 --> 10:52.717
Pascal, you don't
have to do this.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.719
I'll come right
back, I swear.

10:56.188 --> 10:58.089
(baby fusses)

10:59.659 --> 11:01.660
No thank you, estelle.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.361
You need to sleep, lady lola.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.230
You've lost too much blood.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.936
The carriage outside--
is it yours?

11:11.938 --> 11:14.005
Yes.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.141
There was a driver,
but he left on foot

11:16.143 --> 11:18.777
When he heard of the plague.
To be with his family.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.012
I know that's where
you'd like to be

11:21.014 --> 11:22.414
As well. At
mary's side.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.182
I came thinking
that you might be dead

11:24.184 --> 11:26.451
And my child might be
alone in this world.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.420
Well, that would be simpler.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.255
That's not what I wanted.
I'm saying that

11:30.257 --> 11:31.823
I didn't have
a moment to think.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.425
And I resent you
for lying to me.

11:33.427 --> 11:36.695
I am king, I should be
at my court with my wife.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.731
You could have taken the child
straight back to the castle.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.267
It is your right.
The boy who sent for the midwife

11:42.269 --> 11:44.135
Said the bridge was out.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.739
I'd have to cut around the east
village, hard hit by plague.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.442
It would take
more than a day to return.

11:50.444 --> 11:52.343
How would I keep a newborn
alive without

11:52.345 --> 11:55.480
Its mother?
I see you've considered
the possibility.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.982
And yet...

11:57.984 --> 12:01.152
You haven't touched the
baby. It's all right

12:01.154 --> 12:03.788
To admit that you don't
want this. I know you don't.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.224
No one beyond this room
need know

12:06.226 --> 12:07.792
The truth of this child's
parentage.

12:09.261 --> 12:11.029
My poor julien is dead,

12:11.031 --> 12:12.864
But the child
will have his name.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.201
You have it all
sorted out, don't you?

12:16.203 --> 12:18.403
You and mary.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.805
(boy coughing)

12:20.807 --> 12:22.974
George, your fingers.

12:25.311 --> 12:28.747
Lola:
Oh, lord, he has the plague.

12:29.782 --> 12:32.317
We have to leave. Now.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.360
It's for the babe.

12:43.829 --> 12:44.896
It wasn't near my brother.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.998
You didn't touch him either,

12:47.000 --> 12:48.466
Did you?
You should leave this house.

12:48.468 --> 12:51.302
You could ride
one of the horses.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.771
I can't leave my family.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.239
You'll die.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.775
Pardon my saying so, but...

12:56.777 --> 12:59.544
I'd be no safer on my own,
or with the king of France.

13:00.846 --> 13:02.247
You'd do better with guards.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.315
Or lying about
who you are.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.785
Godspeed to you both.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.033
Mary:
Lord eduard,
how may we help you?

13:22.035 --> 13:24.202
Many of the nobles
have secured themselves.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.004
Others prefer to drink
in the gallery

13:26.006 --> 13:28.540
As if nothing is wrong,
but the death count mounts.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.008
Do you know how many are dead

13:30.010 --> 13:31.910
So far?

13:31.912 --> 13:33.545
Fourteen.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.880
14, here on our first day
of contagion.

13:35.882 --> 13:38.583
How many will be dead
when we wake tomorrow?

13:38.585 --> 13:40.585
Do you count the lower class?

13:40.587 --> 13:43.021
Servants and the like,
taken to the catacombs,

13:43.023 --> 13:44.389
The tower,
the south keep?

13:44.391 --> 13:46.825
I count every life lost.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.326
Now what do you want?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.062
To add another to the pile.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.564
I'm sorry to be
so abrupt,

13:52.566 --> 13:54.599
But while my enemy
is accessible I need

13:54.601 --> 13:56.100
To strike.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.036
I don't understand.
There's someone

13:58.038 --> 14:00.104
I thought untouchable.

14:00.106 --> 14:02.173
I'd like him to die of plague.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.975
Put him in one
of the mass holding cells.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.443
He'll be infected
soon enough,

14:05.445 --> 14:07.178
And no one
will heed his cries.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.380
You come here and blatantly
request we murder your foe?

14:09.382 --> 14:10.615
If it were

14:10.617 --> 14:12.217
A request I wouldn't
be so blatant.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.484
It's more of a demand.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.520
One I have no doubt
you will grant.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.588
And what will you gain?

14:16.590 --> 14:19.123
Catherine.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.992
Vengeance.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.560
Pierre voland beds my new wife,

14:22.562 --> 14:24.295
And with
some frequency.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.598
His father's a close friend
of my father's,

14:26.600 --> 14:28.499
They engage in trade as well.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.068
I'd kill him myself,

14:30.070 --> 14:31.302
Or have someone do it,

14:31.304 --> 14:33.204
But I fear
reprisal.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.405
What, from
your father?

14:34.407 --> 14:35.874
If your vengeance
cost him money.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.075
Catherine,
that's enough.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.910
Don't you want to
know the details?

14:38.912 --> 14:41.246
What's at stake?

14:41.248 --> 14:45.250
What kind of animosity
lurks within your realm?

14:45.252 --> 14:46.885
Here are the details.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.653
As you know,
my family provides grain

14:48.655 --> 14:50.321
And meat to the entire region,

14:50.323 --> 14:51.656
But more than that,

14:51.658 --> 14:53.625
The castle relies
on our weekly deliveries.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.994
These deliveries happen when
I signal that I've been paid.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.496
Nobles have raided
the stores of food.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.365
Mm.
And in order
to maintain control

15:00.367 --> 15:02.066
Over them,
the servants, the guards

15:02.068 --> 15:03.568
And the soldiers
who live within reach,

15:03.570 --> 15:06.137
You need this week's
delivery to happen.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.039
Or they may reach
for your necks.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.910
Food for survival
in exchange for one life,

15:11.912 --> 15:14.612
Easily taken.
I leave you to consider

15:14.614 --> 15:16.681
The opportunity.

15:21.954 --> 15:23.955
Welcome
to your rule,

15:23.957 --> 15:25.657
My queen.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.692
And welcome
to the real France.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.641
Is that how you and henry
have maintained your rule?

15:43.643 --> 15:47.111
By bowing to your nobles?

15:47.113 --> 15:49.013
It's simple math.

15:49.015 --> 15:51.349
If one life saves more,

15:51.351 --> 15:53.284
You have your answer.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.119
One life matters.
Every life matters.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.688
We will find grain elsewhere.

15:56.690 --> 15:59.357
I don't think you
understand who eduard is.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.392
He comes from a large, wealthy
family with many holdings.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.728
What more do you want me
to understand?
That as a royal

16:03.730 --> 16:06.965
You are given your
position by birth or marriage,

16:06.967 --> 16:08.733
But your power
comes from nobles--

16:08.735 --> 16:12.270
From the regions that
only they can control.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.372
We have order, food and money

16:14.374 --> 16:17.241
Because they grant it to us.
And in exchange, we

16:17.243 --> 16:21.012
Grant them certain
privileges. Deny eduard,

16:21.014 --> 16:23.548
And you and francis
will pay a very high price.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.550
Francis would never
agree to this.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.684
He hasn't been king yet.

16:26.686 --> 16:29.587
We can punish eduard,
claim his grain.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.589
Claim a noble's property?

16:31.591 --> 16:33.157
Others will revolt.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.593
The death could
be painless,

16:35.595 --> 16:37.595
I can help with
that. One death,

16:37.597 --> 16:40.298
And you'll forget about it
when you see your hungry

16:40.300 --> 16:44.135
Are fed.
I won't forget about it.
I have sacrificed

16:44.137 --> 16:46.004
Lives before,
and every one

16:46.006 --> 16:48.706
Takes me a step further away
from the person I want to be.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.708
The person you are...

16:50.710 --> 16:52.744
Is queen.

16:52.746 --> 16:55.313
And a favor for a favor
keeps you on the throne.

16:55.315 --> 16:58.049
That is your way.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.317
And you were right,

16:59.319 --> 17:01.319
In what you said before.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.588
I want to be a different
kind of queen.

17:03.590 --> 17:07.125
One that my husband
is proud of.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.262
Send word to
lord eduard.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.765
Tell him that I have
considered his request

17:13.767 --> 17:15.133
And that it has been denied.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.741
I'm surprised
you're not

17:23.743 --> 17:26.244
Holed up in castleroy's suite.
(short laugh)
I'm surprised

17:26.246 --> 17:29.714
By how quickly you put
your threat into motion.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.716
I don't blame you for
suspecting otherwise.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.217
Given what I said to you.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.354
But meeting yvette
was blind chance. I didn't

17:36.356 --> 17:38.389
Know she was castleroy's
daughter, I swear.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.458
Really. What are the odds?

17:40.460 --> 17:42.827
That I would meet
someone above my class

17:42.829 --> 17:45.296
With an open heart?
Someone who didn't care

17:45.298 --> 17:49.067
Whether or not I was titled?
Slim, I assure you.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.302
You're going to pursue
her, aren't you?
Whatever happens,

17:51.304 --> 17:53.371
It has nothing
to do with you.
It has everything

17:53.373 --> 17:56.274
To do with me.
Don't you understand,

17:56.276 --> 17:59.277
If you married her, you would
be in my life. My son-in-law.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.113
Even before that, we'd be
forced to see each other,

18:02.115 --> 18:05.283
To pretend there's nothing
between us, and...

18:05.285 --> 18:09.287
Maybe there wouldn't be
for you. Maybe there isn't.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.723
It was days ago
that you broke my heart.
If you feel

18:12.725 --> 18:15.159
Anything for me at all,
don't test me in this way,

18:15.161 --> 18:18.496
For I will fail. I will
make a terrible mistake

18:18.498 --> 18:19.697
And I will be destroyed.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.467
I was on my way to meet her.

18:22.469 --> 18:25.269
Please don't.

18:28.140 --> 18:31.209
(horse whinnies)

18:31.211 --> 18:34.178
(fussing)
shh.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.848
Francis, the baby--
I-I can't feed him.

18:36.850 --> 18:39.150
I need water. I need to
drink something or else...

18:39.152 --> 18:40.852
I know, that's why
we stopped. There's a clean

18:40.854 --> 18:42.820
Lake ahead, but...
(horses whinny)

18:42.822 --> 18:44.822
We're not the only
ones here, are we?

18:44.824 --> 18:46.157
Francis:
No, we're not.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.859
Let me talk to them.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.660
What's wrong
with her?

18:49.662 --> 18:51.162
We're not
infected.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.197
We just need to pass
and get to the lake.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.233
She's not sick.
She's just given birth.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.602
No need for that.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.604
Unless you use it as
a walking stick you lean against

18:59.606 --> 19:03.141
As you bow.
Which I recommend we all do,

19:03.143 --> 19:05.810
As this is our new king.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.679
You look familiar.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.249
My name is louis,
and we're cousins.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.885
Many times removed.
I've seen you at court.

19:13.887 --> 19:17.188
Relax.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.790
You're safe now,
among loyal subjects.

19:19.792 --> 19:23.327
And a few mutts that bark
long before they bite.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.499
Nathan.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.334
Have you seen my wife?

19:30.336 --> 19:31.903
No.
(sighs)

19:31.905 --> 19:34.172
But I'm as bleary-eyed
as you look.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.174
There have been desertions.
I was up all night

19:36.176 --> 19:37.808
Managing the security
of the lockdown.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.710
That's what you should
tell your wife to do.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.213
Lock down in your quarters
and stay there.
I did.

19:42.215 --> 19:45.183
She left a note saying
she was going out this
morning. Trying to find

19:45.185 --> 19:46.617
The child
we care for.
Man: Quickly, now,

19:46.619 --> 19:49.420
Secure lord voland
and his family.

19:56.295 --> 19:57.962
You've made things
very difficult.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.665
A noble fell ill
in the gallery.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.201
It caused a minor panic. It sent
pierre voland and his family

20:03.203 --> 20:04.569
Scurrying to their
private quarters.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.205
Now he's locked in there
with his entire household.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.540
I don't see how you could
get to him without

20:09.542 --> 20:11.375
Killing the others
as witnesses.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.544
Did you not receive my message?

20:13.546 --> 20:16.280
I did. And I'm giving you
the chance to reconsider.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.649
As the landscape has
quite literally changed.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.218
Look outside.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.259
Villagers all around are burning
the homes of the infected.

20:28.261 --> 20:31.262
Now the fires
are burning out of control.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.965
Those other holdings
you were counting on.

20:33.967 --> 20:36.400
We have no grain.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.003
After the plague has passed,
a famine will spread

20:39.005 --> 20:40.671
Across the land.
Many will die.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.306
And their deaths
will be on you.

20:42.308 --> 20:44.609
Take that to your grave
when the hungry rise up

20:44.611 --> 20:46.277
And kill you.

20:51.016 --> 20:54.285
There now,
that's better.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.354
All I needed was
a bit of water

20:56.356 --> 20:58.422
And all you needed was milk.

21:02.694 --> 21:04.695
Your cousin's been generous.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.264
How long are they
planning to stay here?

21:06.266 --> 21:08.833
He says
until the plague has passed.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.035
And then they'll return home.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.704
He rules over a region
two days' travel from here.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.973
It'll be rough terrain
that they'll cross,

21:15.975 --> 21:17.375
But his men and horses

21:17.377 --> 21:18.643
Will be
well-rested.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.611
It could be
days for us.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.313
The only other road
to the castle

21:22.315 --> 21:23.614
Is blocked by fires raging

21:23.616 --> 21:25.716
On either side.
I'm sorry.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.986
Would it really have been
so awful to tell me

21:28.988 --> 21:30.554
The truth?

21:30.556 --> 21:33.991
I would have been angry
with myself, not you.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.993
I tried to handle
the situation on my own,

21:35.995 --> 21:38.329
To save you and mary
from complication.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.897
Because you wanted
your freedom.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.500
I know you, lola. We shared
more than a bed in paris,

21:42.502 --> 21:44.735
And I know how you feel
about court.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.004
You didn't want to be
tied to it or to me.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.572
I don't
blame you.

21:48.574 --> 21:50.408
There's little for you in it.
And one night

21:50.410 --> 21:54.078
Should not define your life.
Or mine.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.847
But I would have liked to have
been consulted in the choice.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.550
So forgive me if I no longer
consult you in mine.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.552
The lie of his paternity
can stand.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.654
When this is done, I-I could be
on my way with my son,

22:03.656 --> 22:05.323
Not yours.
Enough.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.591
I know that you have been
through terrible hardship.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.927
That is not lost on
me. But I am the king

22:09.929 --> 22:11.929
Of France, and...
(baby cries)

22:11.931 --> 22:15.333
The truth is that child
is whoever I say he is.

22:15.335 --> 22:18.102
(baby crying softly)

22:18.104 --> 22:22.106
Pascal, are you here?

22:22.108 --> 22:24.642
There you are. I've been
looking everywhere for you.
What happened?

22:24.644 --> 22:26.677
I wanted to come
back to you,

22:26.679 --> 22:28.979
But he wouldn't
let me leave.

22:28.981 --> 22:32.083
I brought him food and water.

22:32.085 --> 22:34.352
Are you hurt? What's happened?

22:34.354 --> 22:36.587
When I held the cup
to his lips...

22:36.589 --> 22:38.756
He started coughing.

22:43.428 --> 22:45.062
Pascal...

22:45.064 --> 22:47.431
Is that his blood on you?

22:47.433 --> 22:48.966
I can't swallow

22:48.968 --> 22:50.801
And my bones hurt.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.703
It's all right.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.542
Pascal, you have
to listen to me.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.144
I'll take you someplace safe
with food and water

23:00.146 --> 23:01.779
Where I can look after you.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.547
We have to cover your shirt,
and you have

23:03.549 --> 23:04.682
To act as though
you are well.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.617
And we have
to keep you away from pe...

23:08.520 --> 23:10.421
Guards!

23:10.423 --> 23:11.689
They're infected!
No, no, no! No!

23:11.691 --> 23:13.124
Guards!
No!

23:13.126 --> 23:14.625
No, no, no, wait!

23:14.627 --> 23:16.026
I'm one
of the queen's ladies! Please,

23:16.028 --> 23:18.462
I'm not
sick! No!

23:18.464 --> 23:20.931
No!

23:30.108 --> 23:31.742
Catherine:
<i>They will slip away</i>
<i>into peaceful sleep</i>

23:31.744 --> 23:33.944
Like so many families

23:33.946 --> 23:35.946
Caught
by this terrible plague.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.615
Just slip away?

23:37.617 --> 23:39.049
You are
proposing

23:39.051 --> 23:40.551
That we murder lord voland's

23:40.553 --> 23:43.120
Entire household.
It wouldn't
have come

23:43.122 --> 23:44.955
To that
if only you'd listened to me.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.424
I will
not condone

23:46.426 --> 23:48.125
The murder of innocents.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.928
Did you find them--
francis and lola?

23:50.930 --> 23:52.663
Many roads are blocked.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.598
It wasn't until dawn
that I found the mill house

23:54.600 --> 23:56.734
Where they went. The neighbors
had set fire to it.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.136
And beyond the flames
I could see

23:59.138 --> 24:01.005
The front door was nailed shut,

24:01.007 --> 24:04.642
And the painted red "x"
of the plague was on the door.

24:05.911 --> 24:07.578
Is that all?
Didn't you look inside?

24:07.580 --> 24:10.448
I'm immune to the plague,
my queen, but not fire.

24:10.450 --> 24:13.150
I got as close as I could,
but I saw no sign of francis

24:13.152 --> 24:14.685
Or lola.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.720
But if they were inside,

24:16.722 --> 24:19.156
Between the disease
and the flames...
Maybe they left.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.492
Sought shelter elsewhere.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.060
Until I
see proof,

24:23.062 --> 24:25.196
I know they are alive.
They have to be.

24:25.198 --> 24:27.832
Yes.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.668
I don't want
to believe it either.

24:30.670 --> 24:34.004
But you're right--
for you, francis must survive.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.606
What do you mean?

24:35.608 --> 24:37.942
If even a whisper
of this news gets out,

24:37.944 --> 24:39.210
All eyes will turn

24:39.212 --> 24:41.178
From you
to the future,

24:41.180 --> 24:43.714
To the next king
after francis,

24:43.716 --> 24:47.084
To me, as regent, as charles is

24:47.086 --> 24:50.788
But a child.
You have just found out
that your eldest son

24:50.790 --> 24:52.523
Might be dead,

24:52.525 --> 24:54.492
And your first instinct
is to seize power?

24:54.494 --> 24:55.726
I've only had

24:55.728 --> 24:57.528
One instinct ever,
and that is to protect

24:57.530 --> 24:58.762
My family and their birthright,

24:58.764 --> 25:00.197
Which is
their rule.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.966
When this plague is done,
France will need

25:01.968 --> 25:05.035
Two things to survive:
Food and stability.

25:05.037 --> 25:09.540
I'll provide food with a painful
but needed sacrifice.

25:09.542 --> 25:12.243
I'll deal with the
volands and, unlike you,

25:12.245 --> 25:15.513
I'll provide stability
with plenty of sons to wear

25:15.515 --> 25:17.681
This country's crown.
I won't allow you to do that.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.283
When francis returns...
He will thank me

25:19.285 --> 25:23.120
For saving his realm
from his very naive young queen.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.295
(goat bleats)

25:31.297 --> 25:33.697
Lord narcisse.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.533
Lord narcisse.
I know that name.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.835
He controls
land around here.
More and more

25:37.837 --> 25:39.837
Every day.
Narcisse,

25:39.839 --> 25:41.038
What brings you here?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.706
Same as you, lord conde.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.642
Clean air and water.
I'm heading north,

25:44.644 --> 25:47.177
Where the plague
hasn't yet spread.

25:47.179 --> 25:50.080
But that doesn't explain
what our new king is doing here.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.916
Majesty.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.885
I am stephan narcisse.
I was a friend

25:54.887 --> 25:56.320
Of your father's.

25:56.322 --> 25:57.988
The king was reviewing
cathedral repairs

25:57.990 --> 26:01.225
When the roads were cut off
by the plague. I offered

26:01.227 --> 26:03.661
My hospitality while he waits
to return to the castle.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.663
I see.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.699
Very kind of you, conde.

26:15.774 --> 26:18.609
We found the girl alone
near her house,

26:18.611 --> 26:21.912
With a red "x"
marked on the door.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.148
Lola:
Estelle.
Her family

26:24.150 --> 26:25.649
Were dying of the plague,

26:25.651 --> 26:27.651
The neighbors
already gathering animal fat

26:27.653 --> 26:30.788
To set the
roof ablaze.
My god, why is she in a cage?

26:30.790 --> 26:34.124
I realize it looks... Barbaric,

26:34.126 --> 26:35.759
Keeping a girl
where my livestock

26:35.761 --> 26:37.328
Should be, but the bars
are simply to isolate her

26:37.330 --> 26:38.796
Until we know

26:38.798 --> 26:40.197
That she's not infected.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.299
Then she'll be released.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.969
Had we left her there,
she would surely have died.

26:44.971 --> 26:47.605
My heart couldn't
bear the thought.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.774
I wouldn't get too close,
milady.

26:50.776 --> 26:54.178
If she is infectious, then you
would have to be isolated, too.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.314
And then you couldn't
feed your baby.

26:57.316 --> 27:01.752
Water your horses,
then yourselves.

27:03.388 --> 27:05.623
Why did you make up that story
about the cathedral?

27:05.625 --> 27:08.359
This is not a man
you share secrets with.

27:08.361 --> 27:11.261
Why don't you like him?
What has he done?

27:11.263 --> 27:13.263
Some nobles build fortunes
with hard work

27:13.265 --> 27:15.399
Or by serving the crown.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.668
Others find shortcuts.

27:17.670 --> 27:18.902
Ah.

27:18.904 --> 27:20.037
Conde:
I'd be curious to know

27:20.039 --> 27:21.038
If the girl's
family lived

27:21.040 --> 27:22.406
Long enough to die of plague.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.676
You'll know if narcisse winds up
with their lands.

27:25.678 --> 27:28.379
Conde.
Oh, safe voyage on your boat.

27:28.381 --> 27:31.815
I hear it's finally
arrived, waiting for you.

27:33.218 --> 27:35.653
Oh. Did lord conde not mention

27:35.655 --> 27:37.287
That he has a boat
waiting for him up north

27:37.289 --> 27:38.722
To escape
the plague?

27:38.724 --> 27:40.724
No?

27:40.726 --> 27:44.128
I would have thought he would
offer his new friend the king

27:44.130 --> 27:45.829
The same chance of survival

27:45.831 --> 27:49.433
As his own. Be careful
of this one, majesty.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.268
He's ambitious.

27:51.270 --> 27:54.271
A new king needs to know
who his real friends are,

27:54.273 --> 27:56.740
Especially at times like this.

28:01.146 --> 28:04.214
Kenna:
<i>Pascal.</i>

28:04.216 --> 28:06.383
Pascal, I can't hear you.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.319
I think I fell asleep.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.823
Would you like me
to sing you another song?

28:12.825 --> 28:15.392
I had a dream.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.828
I saw my
mother.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.698
You did?

28:20.700 --> 28:22.332
She was younger, though.

28:22.334 --> 28:25.335
She looked...
Like you.

28:25.337 --> 28:29.373
She said she'd
care for me.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.776
Or was that you?
(sniffles)

28:32.778 --> 28:36.280
We've both been blessed
to care for you.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.749
You're a wonderful boy

28:38.751 --> 28:41.952
And a good soul,

28:41.954 --> 28:44.955
And you are
and always were loved.

28:44.957 --> 28:48.258
Pascal, god loves you, too.

28:54.265 --> 28:56.500
Pascal?

28:58.036 --> 29:02.106
Pascal, can you hear me?

29:06.444 --> 29:10.447
(sniffles)
god will love you, too.

29:11.449 --> 29:13.217
Kenna.

29:13.219 --> 29:16.120
If you can hear my voice,
answer me!

29:16.122 --> 29:18.989
Woman:
I'm here! Help!
Kenna.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.425
(grunting)

29:23.228 --> 29:25.362
(grunts)

29:26.998 --> 29:29.867
(grunting)

29:29.869 --> 29:31.869
I'm so thirsty.
No, you can't

29:31.871 --> 29:33.537
Go that way.
That's the gallery.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.005
You can't go in there.
Please, I want
to go.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.473
It's full
of people.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.542
(shouts, grunts)

29:38.544 --> 29:39.910
(gasps)

29:39.912 --> 29:41.211
Man:
My lord.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.180
Stay back.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.816
I'm surely infected, too.

29:51.923 --> 29:55.192
(coughing)

29:55.194 --> 29:56.860
Oh, no.
Thank you for coming.

29:56.862 --> 29:58.162
That's close enough.

29:59.864 --> 30:01.231
I'm stricken.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.233
I don't know
how it happened.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.869
I was so careful.
Is there anything I can do?

30:05.871 --> 30:07.104
Oddly,

30:07.106 --> 30:08.505
You've already done it.

30:08.507 --> 30:12.910
I can meet my maker
with less blood on my hands.

30:12.912 --> 30:16.880
Your hesitation to take a life
has saved me from taking many.

30:16.882 --> 30:19.883
I simply didn't have time
before falling ill

30:19.885 --> 30:22.553
To murder
that household.

30:22.555 --> 30:25.088
There's something else
you should know.

30:25.090 --> 30:27.291
I didn't want to be me either.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.960
Well, I blame henry.
Being a queen unloved

30:29.962 --> 30:32.596
By your king is excruciating.

30:32.598 --> 30:34.531
And dangerous.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.266
Henry loved you.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.901
Some.

30:37.903 --> 30:39.570
Once.

30:39.572 --> 30:42.039
Not enough.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.574
Not the way that francis

30:43.576 --> 30:46.844
Loves you.
An indiscretion,

30:46.846 --> 30:50.214
Even a child, doesn't have
to get in the way of a marriage.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.316
(sighs)

30:52.318 --> 30:54.318
Don't let lola come between you.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.087
Because you are nothing
but a guest in this court

30:57.089 --> 30:59.389
Without the support
of your king.

31:05.630 --> 31:07.631
It worked.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.533
How long will
her symptoms last?

31:09.535 --> 31:12.970
The dose I gave her will
only last a day or two.

31:12.972 --> 31:16.039
And then she will have
a miraculous recovery.

31:16.041 --> 31:19.910
We can only pray she
doesn't suspect our hand.

31:19.912 --> 31:22.913
You have risked much
to help me.

31:22.915 --> 31:25.616
Death already walks
the halls freely here.

31:25.618 --> 31:30.020
And to see catherine
feed it more souls...

31:30.022 --> 31:33.257
I couldn't save
my own family,

31:33.259 --> 31:36.393
But I can save this one.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.596
(indistinct crowd chatter,
crickets chirping)

31:42.200 --> 31:45.035
I was dishonest with you.

31:45.037 --> 31:47.638
I understand why you didn't
tell me about the boat.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.374
It's like an ark
in a great flood.

31:50.376 --> 31:54.244
If word got out, it could be
overrun or taken from you.

31:57.181 --> 32:00.017
That lady sparkling
by the fire is my mistress,

32:00.019 --> 32:01.451
Lady doutzen of amsterdam.

32:01.453 --> 32:02.986
(women giggling)

32:02.988 --> 32:05.188
She's married.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.624
I'm not.

32:07.626 --> 32:10.327
But we share in the sin
and so much more.

32:13.097 --> 32:16.333
When people started dying, I
promised her a safe voyage home.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.335
Some of my men
will go with her.

32:18.337 --> 32:21.972
The other passengers are members
of her household, her children.

32:21.974 --> 32:25.008
There's still room
for one more mistress

32:25.010 --> 32:27.978
And her child.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.647
Lady lola is not my mistress.

32:30.649 --> 32:33.617
I love my wife.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.453
If you love your wife,
put them on the boat.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.655
Lady lola could marry again.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.657
And the child won't grow up
like your brother--

32:40.659 --> 32:44.995
A bastard spoken of
in scornful whispers.

32:44.997 --> 32:47.230
You'll have others.

32:47.232 --> 32:51.735
I know what it is
to make a mess of love.

32:52.704 --> 32:55.038
Go back to your wife.

32:55.040 --> 32:58.542
Without the poison
of a lover and a bastard child.

32:58.544 --> 33:02.012
(woman laughing)

33:04.315 --> 33:06.049
Conde's boat is leaving
in the morning.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.751
You can accompany them
to the netherlands

33:07.753 --> 33:09.119
And then continue on.

33:09.121 --> 33:10.387
You can live
your own lives.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.022
What will you do?

33:12.024 --> 33:13.056
I'm going to ride out
in the morning.

33:13.058 --> 33:14.224
I have to get back to mary.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.233
Finally.

33:29.507 --> 33:32.776
Still waiting on your
handsome young soldier?

33:32.778 --> 33:34.745
Shh.

33:34.747 --> 33:39.416
I'm not so sure
he's coming.

33:39.418 --> 33:42.185
But I haven't given up hope
just yet.

33:47.525 --> 33:50.160
Mary:
Eduard narcisse, I have

33:50.162 --> 33:51.795
Brought you here to tell you

33:51.797 --> 33:54.031
That lord voland's family
is not to be harmed

33:54.033 --> 33:55.632
Under any circumstances.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.367
Where is the queen mother?

33:57.369 --> 33:59.136
<i>I</i> am the queen of France,

33:59.138 --> 34:01.104
And you are <i>my</i> subject.

34:03.441 --> 34:06.810
What is your real grievance
with lord voland?

34:06.812 --> 34:11.681
Even you wouldn't slaughter
an entire household for a woman.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.051
This could have been so much
cleaner for me and for you.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.119
I'm not the kind of man who
likes to get his hands dirty.

34:16.121 --> 34:18.055
One favor--

34:18.057 --> 34:19.389
It's all I asked. One life.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.124
But now so many.

34:21.126 --> 34:23.126
What did you do?

34:23.128 --> 34:25.062
After I found the poison,
I found the dumbwaiter,

34:25.064 --> 34:27.097
Which delivered
the water

34:27.099 --> 34:28.765
Directly into
their locked suite.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.534
Oh, god, no.

34:37.241 --> 34:39.409
Mary:
They're all dead.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.545
Poisoned.

34:41.547 --> 34:46.750
Find out who each and every
member of this household is.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.486
For even the servants' families
deserve to know.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.865
(distant crying and shouting)

35:05.536 --> 35:08.105
Dear god, stop their suffering.

35:10.842 --> 35:14.177
(sighs)

35:19.717 --> 35:22.152
You there...

35:22.154 --> 35:24.187
Child, are you all right?

35:26.124 --> 35:28.191
Wait. I know you.

35:28.193 --> 35:31.695
You gave me back my clementine
before when she fell.

35:31.697 --> 35:34.331
They've all fallen now.
So much suffering.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.399
What's happened to you?

35:36.401 --> 35:38.335
Why aren't you with your family?

35:41.139 --> 35:43.907
Are you dead?

35:43.909 --> 35:45.842
Girl:
<i>Yes.</i>

35:46.844 --> 35:49.779
Am I? Was I infected?

35:49.781 --> 35:51.515
No.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.683
You'll live.

35:53.685 --> 35:56.353
But I'm not sure where
I'm supposed to be.

35:56.355 --> 36:00.624
The same is true of many
others, and they're angry.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.260
We're not leaving.
Not till we're done.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.895
Done? With what?

36:04.897 --> 36:07.330
There will be a reckoning.

36:10.268 --> 36:12.736
(gasps)

36:19.310 --> 36:22.445
(wind whistling)

36:22.447 --> 36:24.714
(bird squawking)

36:28.719 --> 36:31.221
Mary,

36:31.223 --> 36:32.455
I didn't realize you...

36:32.457 --> 36:34.524
That I was having you followed?

36:34.526 --> 36:37.227
I knew you would
signal for the grain.

36:37.229 --> 36:38.628
I was right about you.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.930
You don't want
to risk my husband's ire.

36:39.932 --> 36:41.731
It's one thing
to murder a foe...

36:41.733 --> 36:43.300
An entire household.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.335
Another to starve his court,

36:45.337 --> 36:46.870
So, let's put it behind us.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.673
Take him. Make sure
he's unarmed.
Why?

36:49.675 --> 36:53.210
You can't change anything.
It's done.

36:53.212 --> 36:56.246
Yes, it is...
And by your own admission.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.649
Murder is a very serious crime.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.351
Even during a plague,
when it seems

37:01.353 --> 37:03.286
Some people believe
that a little extra

37:03.288 --> 37:04.654
Death shouldn't
trouble us.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.389
The volands are already gone.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.993
You may have this shipment of
grain, but what about the next?

37:09.995 --> 37:12.395
Why make an enemy
out of those you need most?

37:12.397 --> 37:14.831
What do you gain?
Justice.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.299
Take him away.

37:16.301 --> 37:18.802
You're wasting
your time!

37:18.804 --> 37:20.804
My father will free me!

37:20.806 --> 37:25.475
No, he won't...
Because he'll never find you.

37:25.477 --> 37:28.311
Kenna? Kenna?

37:28.313 --> 37:30.680
Kenna, can you hear me?

37:30.682 --> 37:32.315
Kenna:
Bash! Bash?
Is anyone here?

37:32.317 --> 37:33.984
Kenna? Kenna, is that you?

37:33.986 --> 37:35.752
Bash! (grunts)

37:35.754 --> 37:37.354
Bash!

37:37.356 --> 37:38.488
Bash!
Kenna!

37:38.490 --> 37:40.023
Is that you? Bash!

37:40.025 --> 37:41.958
It's all right. I'm here.
I'll free you.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.693
(grunting)

37:43.695 --> 37:46.296
Hurry!
Stand back.

37:46.298 --> 37:49.432
(grunts)
oh, bash.

37:49.434 --> 37:52.035
Oh, thank god you came!

37:52.037 --> 37:54.271
(panting)

37:54.273 --> 37:56.306
I was afraid
you were dead.

37:56.308 --> 37:58.008
I was afraid
we both were.

37:58.010 --> 38:00.443
Oh, bash, pascal--

38:00.445 --> 38:02.512
He was infected,
and now he's gone.

38:02.514 --> 38:05.015
Well, it's over now.

38:05.017 --> 38:08.385
You're all right.
We're both all right.

38:13.991 --> 38:16.760
(horse sputters)
the ship is two days'
ride from here,

38:16.762 --> 38:18.428
With frequent stops
for rest.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.997
Your friend and her baby will
manage the trip comfortably.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.599
I'm grateful.

38:22.601 --> 38:25.702
(baby crying)

38:25.704 --> 38:28.371
Lola?

38:34.879 --> 38:37.080
(baby crying)

38:37.082 --> 38:38.715
(sighs)

38:38.717 --> 38:41.318
Lola, he's crying.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.587
(baby continues crying)

38:44.589 --> 38:47.557
Come on, don't cry.

38:47.559 --> 38:50.026
(baby crying)

38:56.734 --> 38:59.669
All right, then.

39:00.838 --> 39:04.641
Shh, shh.

39:04.643 --> 39:07.043
(baby cooing)

39:07.045 --> 39:09.579
Lola:
I'm sorry.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.548
I went to fetch water
for the trip.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.583
He was asleep when I left.

39:13.585 --> 39:16.052
Francis...

39:18.656 --> 39:20.557
The party is mounting up.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.859
Riders will follow
to carry your things, my lady.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.060
Thank you.

39:24.062 --> 39:27.497
â™ª you need not have come

39:27.499 --> 39:29.866
â™ª to my lair...

39:29.868 --> 39:33.370
I understand all the reasons,
I do. I ju...

39:33.372 --> 39:35.739
I just can't.

39:35.741 --> 39:38.742
â™ª do not know
who you'll find in there â™ª

39:38.744 --> 39:41.378
You can't leave
on that boat.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.813
You won't take away my son.

39:46.550 --> 39:51.454
â™ª sink my claw
into the snow... â™ª

39:51.456 --> 39:54.457
Eduard:
You're taking me
to the catacombs.

39:54.459 --> 39:56.092
That's where
the sick are locked up.

39:56.094 --> 39:58.928
If you put me down here,
I'll die!

39:58.930 --> 40:01.398
Mary:
I'm aware.
I'm what this realm needs.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.733
Nobles like my father
lord narcisse gave the crown

40:03.735 --> 40:06.102
To your husband's family.
They can take it away.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.872
You're making a mistake!

40:08.874 --> 40:10.707
And your husband
will hate you for it.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.709
As soon as he learns
how the world works,

40:12.711 --> 40:14.411
How it's always worked.

40:14.413 --> 40:15.979
Open the door, put him inside.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.714
His mother knows it.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.616
So did his father.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.117
His heart beats
with their blood,

40:21.119 --> 40:22.719
And there is
nothing older

40:22.721 --> 40:25.054
Or stronger than royal blood.

40:25.056 --> 40:27.424
You'll see.
(whimpering)

40:27.426 --> 40:30.727
No! No!

40:34.432 --> 40:35.632
(coughing)

40:35.634 --> 40:37.434
â™ª out amongst the wild...

40:37.436 --> 40:40.470
No! Mary!

40:40.472 --> 40:41.771
No!

40:41.773 --> 40:44.574
(screaming):
No!

40:46.744 --> 40:50.880
â™ª for you to arrive

40:53.517 --> 40:56.986
â™ª and the one you're holding

40:58.155 --> 41:01.658
â™ª is not the one
you left behind â™ª

41:05.863 --> 41:10.200
â™ª he'll be there waiting

41:10.202 --> 41:14.237
â™ª for all of your life

41:14.239 --> 41:17.607
â™ª and though our goals are all

41:17.609 --> 41:20.109
â™ª at one

41:20.111 --> 41:23.012
â™ª with the snow

41:26.016 --> 41:29.552
â™ª I could not turn away from
all I wish I did not know. â™ª
