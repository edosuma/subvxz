WEBVTT

00:13.013 --> 00:14.723
This is an interview
being conducted

00:14.806 --> 00:17.225
at the request of
the Office of the Inspector General...

00:17.976 --> 00:21.062
and will form part of the official inquiry
into recent events.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.232
Are you happy to proceed?

00:34.826 --> 00:37.412
Did you understand the question,
Special Agent Madani?

00:43.001 --> 00:44.085
I heard you fine.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.050
Let's just get this over with.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.969
I'm sure we've all got things
we'd rather be doing, huh?

01:02.103 --> 01:06.524
23.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.361
I'm sure you could use a refresher, yeah?

01:17.994 --> 01:20.747
I just wanna make sure
we're on the same page before we go on.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.257
A Homeland agent's poor taste
in sexual partners

01:31.341 --> 01:35.553
caused the murder of several DHS agents
and almost cost her own life.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.140
That the tale you want me to spin?

01:41.226 --> 01:43.770
The one that leaves Rawlins
a decorated hero

01:43.853 --> 01:47.148
and Ahmad Zubair just some guy
in an unmarked grave?

01:47.232 --> 01:50.026
It's also the one that
allows you to keep your job

01:50.110 --> 01:51.736
and Frank Castle his liberty.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.072
And you still feel like shit,

01:54.155 --> 01:56.282
because all you did
was try to do the right thing,

01:56.366 --> 01:58.076
bring the right people to justice.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.789
I think you're pretty special, Madani.

02:02.872 --> 02:06.167
I mean, you're lying here in a bed
with a bullet hole in your head,

02:06.251 --> 02:08.378
and you're still not thinking of yourself.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.464
That's as rare as rocking horse shit.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.760
And we need people like you
in the system, or we're lost.

02:16.761 --> 02:19.305
No one's asking you to like the lie.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.392
Just to understand it.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.440
People have a right to the truth.
Whatever else, there's that.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.484
I am not gonna pretend
that this isn't gonna sting,

02:31.568 --> 02:35.071
but this is the least worst option
for all of us.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.577
Yeah.

02:49.836 --> 02:50.920
Call her back in.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.051
Was your relationship
with Billy Russo sexual in nature?

03:01.472 --> 03:02.473
Yes.

03:03.808 --> 03:06.728
Where did you and Billy Russo
first engage in intercourse?

03:10.690 --> 03:12.233
In my apartment.

03:12.775 --> 03:15.486
Do you believe Billy Russo
engaged in this relationship

03:15.570 --> 03:19.282
to manipulate you
and gain access to your investigation?

03:21.242 --> 03:22.243
Yes.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.037
Did he succeed at that aim?

03:30.752 --> 03:31.628
Yes.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.591
When did you first become aware
of Billy Russo's criminal activity?

03:39.761 --> 03:42.472
When he pointed a gun at my head
and threatened to kill me.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.975
You didn't ever consider him
a suspect before that time?

03:46.059 --> 03:48.811
No. We wouldn't all be sitting here
if I had, would we?

03:51.022 --> 03:52.232
Should you have?

04:00.323 --> 04:01.241
Yeah.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.242
For the tape.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.333
Yes.

04:13.628 --> 04:17.298
Once you discovered his criminal actions,
you endeavored to apprehend him?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.094
Yes.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.263
Alone?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.101
Yes.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.272
For the record...

04:34.607 --> 04:37.986
Sam Stein warned me
against trusting Russo.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.031
I ignored his warnings...

04:44.325 --> 04:46.077
and it got him killed.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.098
I've never been shot.

05:07.890 --> 05:12.020
I've never even pulled my gun
on anyone in anger.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.772
So I can't even pretend to imagine
how you...

05:16.441 --> 05:18.318
But I have made decisions,

05:18.401 --> 05:23.740
and I've sent men and women into
situations where they've lost their lives.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.409
And I have to deal with that.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.537
And, now, so do you.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.207
Now, you wanna call her back,
tell her everything?

05:33.291 --> 05:37.086
Castle, Zubair, Rawlins... Go ahead.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.298
I'd survive.

05:41.382 --> 05:45.136
The CIA would certainly survive.
Even Rafi.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.433
I don't know about justice,
but the truth would be out there.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.561
You and Castle
would have to bear the brunt of that.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.272
So it's your call.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.025
Gut check, Madani.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.363
Are you good with all of this?

06:04.822 --> 06:07.283
Are you good with all of this

06:08.576 --> 06:10.370
So, are you good with that?

06:17.460 --> 06:20.421
Are you good with that

06:22.048 --> 06:23.549
Easy's got nothing to do with it.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.343
But it does, right? You...

06:25.426 --> 06:28.388
You decide someone deserves to be gone,
and, bang, they're gone.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.973
No second thoughts, no qualms,
no conscience.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.643
And then on you go,
happy and safe on your...

06:33.726 --> 06:36.479
I guess at least borderline psychopathic,
merry way.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.983
Listen, Madani, you're right.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.611
I can do it.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.364
I could kill him and just walk away.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.576
But that doesn't mean it's easy.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.790
I can live with it, yeah.
I can live with anything.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.459
There's no peace up here.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.545
There's no happy medium
that I'm looking for.

07:00.628 --> 07:01.462
But war...

07:02.004 --> 07:03.464
War is not easy.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.007
"War"?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.385
"War"? Listen to yourself!

07:07.468 --> 07:10.847
This isn't some foreign country
with guys you never met shooting at you.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.099
-This is home. It's different.
-Is that right?

07:13.182 --> 07:14.600
It has to be different.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.686
Yeah, tell that to my wife and kids!

07:26.070 --> 07:27.071
Madani...

07:27.613 --> 07:28.781
you went into that hospital,

07:28.865 --> 07:30.700
you sat with him
every day and every night.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.286
What did you want Just be honest.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.329
You thought about it, didn't you?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.915
You were tempted to just put him down.

07:40.376 --> 07:41.544
Never.

07:41.627 --> 07:42.879
Why are we meeting like this?

07:42.962 --> 07:44.964
Why don't you have Curtis
in some interview room

07:45.047 --> 07:47.550
with a bunch of your lackeys around you?
It's because you know it.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.511
You realize this only ends
with Billy dead.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.931
That's why I'm here, right?
To convince you that that's okay.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.184
-It's okay to want that.
-No.

07:58.686 --> 07:59.687
No.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.067
Okay.

08:07.361 --> 08:08.362
All right.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.992
-How about you?
-Oh, I wanna go home.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.994
I want this over with.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.414
You want him dead, Curt?

08:19.832 --> 08:21.209
How else does this end?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.544
You know where he is?

08:24.545 --> 08:26.172
I know a guy who does.

08:28.382 --> 08:29.800
Then go home.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.011
Just get me the address
and stay out of the way.

08:34.472 --> 08:38.643
Look, I owe you both.
That's why I'm gonna get this done.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.064
Question is, is that gonna be enough?

08:45.066 --> 08:47.777
'Cause maybe this is something
you need to do for yourselves.

11:44.787 --> 11:45.955
-More?
-Mmm-hmm.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.870
Did I hurt you?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.417
I thought that was kind of the point.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.671
You live with pain long enough,
you start to...

12:37.798 --> 12:39.633
miss it when it's gone.

12:43.804 --> 12:49.393
And then, well, you discover
the pain-pleasure connection.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.277
-It's better than pills, right?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.489
I would say so.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.040
Ask.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.835
Everybody does, in the end.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.170
Oh?

13:16.879 --> 13:18.214
Everybody, huh?

13:21.425 --> 13:22.718
No one special.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.767
I scare them off.

13:35.606 --> 13:36.607
Okay.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.736
What happened?

13:47.034 --> 13:48.994
I took a fall when I was nine...

13:50.162 --> 13:52.665
and spent two years
getting put back together.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.048
Accident?

14:05.177 --> 14:06.178
Yeah.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.601
Well, they're part of you now.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.772
That's all I need to know.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.233
Where are you going?

15:06.780 --> 15:07.781
Billy?

15:11.285 --> 15:12.745
I slept great last night.

15:14.705 --> 15:18.167
No dreams, no... skulls.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.045
No fear.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.424
-That's good. We're making progress.
-Yeah.

15:25.966 --> 15:29.637
Yeah, I feel good today.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.721
Clear.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.016
But not because of any therapy.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.019
Because of you.

15:38.687 --> 15:42.149
You. Us. This... this, here.

15:45.694 --> 15:49.031
But also, because of what's out there.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.158
My... My guys.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.535
You think you're safe, but you're not.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.664
Well, I don't give a shit about safe.
I never did.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.669
You wanna know... Do you wanna know
why I think I was scared?

16:04.505 --> 16:08.133
Because I was locked in a room
with no way out. I am not a...

16:09.134 --> 16:11.428
I'm not a house pet, Krista.

16:12.221 --> 16:16.141
And, look, I-- I know...
I know what it is that I lost.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.061
I had everything that I ever wanted.

16:19.144 --> 16:24.483
Money, power, purpose, my own...
my own company. Apparently.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.113
And, somehow,
I managed to throw that all away.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.573
I don't know what's worse.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.450
Losing it...

16:35.160 --> 16:39.456
or not even remembering
what it felt like to have it.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.042
But I want some of it back.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.461
And I can't...

16:50.384 --> 16:54.555
You've done so much for me already,
and I shouldn't be here anymore.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.558
You're leaving !

16:58.851 --> 17:00.436
That's what you think I am?

17:01.812 --> 17:05.024
You think I'm gonna let myself
be used by you?

17:05.107 --> 17:06.942
I am not to blame. I know that.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.153
Nobody is blaming you for anything.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.739
People left behind always get the blame.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.330
Looking for this?

17:22.207 --> 17:25.544
The last woman to point a gun at me
got a bullet in the head.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.591
-Or so you tell me.
-You don't get to decide.

17:32.009 --> 17:36.680
-I am trying to protect you here.
-I will not be the reason you die.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.769
And I won't be the reason
that you ruin your life.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.066
Don't go.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.827
You're sure this is everyone?

18:39.910 --> 18:41.245
I got a print for everyone

18:41.328 --> 18:44.373
who so much as thumbed a mug
at the coffee shop that morning.

18:46.291 --> 18:49.837
The cup's got a print,
but nothing comes back. I mean...

18:50.587 --> 18:52.005
that's your guy.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.551
I just don't know who your guy is.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.679
I mean, that's him.
I just don't have a way to tell--

18:58.762 --> 18:59.763
Yeah, I get it.

19:02.015 --> 19:05.602
Look, run them through NSA, CIA, DOD, too.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.896
Duh. Because it never entered my head
to do that?

19:08.438 --> 19:11.150
I've run them through all the databases,
domestic and foreign.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.069
Even tried a few ID tools
that don't officially exist.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.530
Not a single hit on your guy.

19:16.613 --> 19:19.616
Which sucks,
because I really wanted to impress you.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.788
It's a big deal for us, you being the SAC.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.082
It totally kicks ass.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.544
Man's a ghost.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.381
How is that even possible?

19:34.464 --> 19:36.466
Ah, come on. If he's not in the system,

19:36.550 --> 19:39.261
then someone
must have manipulated the system.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.013
It's all computers.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.472
Hack into the right place,

19:42.556 --> 19:44.975
change a few details,
move things around...

19:45.058 --> 19:47.060
Poof! Gone.

19:47.144 --> 19:52.566
Or I make his prints match your face.
Think about that.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.486
I mean, identity is a construct,
really, right?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.158
No one disappears forever. Trust me.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.954
You can hide your identity, but you...
you can't hide who you are.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.749
We all think you're badass, boss.

20:10.375 --> 20:14.755
The way you run this place,
pretty cool shit.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.717
I mean, whoever that dude is,
I'd be scared if I was him.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.221
You've got some serious filter issues,
you know that?

20:22.304 --> 20:25.432
Totally. My mom tells me that,
like, all the time at home.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.559
How old are you?

20:27.643 --> 20:30.312
Thirty. Pretty sure she wants
me out the house.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.244
You first.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.120
It's like that, huh?

21:18.235 --> 21:19.778
Shit.

21:21.822 --> 21:25.242
Did you think it was gonna be easy

21:25.867 --> 21:27.369
Yeah, it would've been nice.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.122
Any other ideas?

21:32.165 --> 21:34.668
Jimbo said they were all drinking
at some bar.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.712
-We could check that out.
-Okay.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.929
-Your boy's a tweaker, huh?
-Looks like it.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.684
I wish I was surprised.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.654
Get down now! Nobody move!

22:03.196 --> 22:05.240
Get down! Get down!

22:06.533 --> 22:07.784
God damn it!

22:08.952 --> 22:09.953
And we're screwed.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.955
Shit-for-brains here
is gonna mess it up, Billy.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.665
Who you calling shit-for-brains, asshole?

22:13.749 --> 22:16.376
Easy, easy, both of you.
This is why we train, all right?

22:16.460 --> 22:17.961
Get all the mistakes out now.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.714
-"And like that, he was gone."
-All right.

22:20.797 --> 22:23.216
I'm backup, anyway.
I'm never gonna be in the place.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.343
So what's the point?

22:24.926 --> 22:27.304
The point is, we all know
each other's jobs and positions,

22:27.387 --> 22:29.848
so whatever happens, we're ready for it.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.852
Yo, yo! How we doing?

22:34.353 --> 22:36.772
We're getting there. All good with you?

22:36.855 --> 22:41.693
00 a.m. tomorrow, 300 grand.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.737
That chicken's gonna be ripe for plucking.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.615
Planning on wearing that uniform?

22:46.698 --> 22:49.493
Yeah, Billy, I'm that dumb.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.953
You took a risk just wearing it here.

22:52.037 --> 22:55.040
I took a risk offering this job up
to all you jabronis.

22:55.123 --> 22:58.251
Wasn't for me, you'd be hitting
some grocery store for chump change.

23:00.295 --> 23:02.297
Let's go again.
Bobby, you joining us?

23:02.881 --> 23:04.633
I can't let you jarheads have all the fun.

23:04.716 --> 23:05.967
Okay, you take the waiting area.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.678
Mike, you spell in with me. Geno,
you're our customer at the counter.

23:08.762 --> 23:12.391
Waiting area

23:12.474 --> 23:16.812
The point is, we all know
each other's jobs and positions.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.194
Everybody, get down!
I wanna see some hands!

23:24.277 --> 23:26.029
Get down! Get down!

23:32.911 --> 23:34.246
Shit, Billy.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.705
What are you doing?

23:36.331 --> 23:37.624
Bobby's smart.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.793
Keeping us on our toes.

23:40.335 --> 23:43.046
There could be a bunch of vets in there
waiting to cash their checks.

23:43.630 --> 23:46.133
Anyone could decide to play hero.
Ain't that right?

23:47.884 --> 23:50.971
So we gotta get control fast,
then we gotta keep it.

23:53.014 --> 23:54.015
You all right?

23:59.229 --> 24:00.647
You hit like a marine.

24:01.356 --> 24:03.233
Yeah, I do.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.737
All right, guys.
Let's go over this one more time.

24:13.160 --> 24:18.290
Okay, we got two cars.
One here, Todd. One here, Mike.

24:19.249 --> 24:22.252
Jake, Bobby and I, we come out,
split up between the two cars.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.963
We take off, we meet up again
at the rendezvous point.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.176
-What's here?
-Me and José.

24:29.259 --> 24:30.177
Mmm-hmm.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.554
-Backup.
-That's right.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.223
Anything comes down on us,
you two clear it out of our way.

24:38.226 --> 24:39.227
You good?

24:41.188 --> 24:43.565
Well, all right, then.
Let's all get some sleep.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.944
Cold as shit in here.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.572
I'm gonna go back to my place
for the night.

24:52.949 --> 24:53.950
Nah.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.329
Better if we all stay together
till after the job.

24:57.412 --> 24:58.997
Operational security.

24:59.789 --> 25:02.834
From now on, we all stay close
until after this thing gets done.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.763
Just like old times, huh, Curt?

25:16.097 --> 25:17.098
Yeah.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.601
Sitting around, picking daisies,
because of shit intel.

25:19.684 --> 25:20.810
Kiss my ass, Frank.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.980
You are the most impatient asshole I know.

25:24.064 --> 25:27.317
How many times... How many times
I had to hear this same bullshit,

25:27.400 --> 25:29.736
only for the target to turn up
three days in?

25:29.819 --> 25:32.948
Three days in, Frank.
You got a concentration problem, bro.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.825
Nah, I got a bored-out-of-my-ass problem
is what I got.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.744
You just hate standing still.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.580
That's why
you're always looking for a fight.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.124
An excuse to keep moving.

25:43.792 --> 25:47.170
Standing still, more or less,
that's how life works, Frank.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.548
In the real world, at least.

25:50.090 --> 25:54.052
Most people are just looking for a place
to be happy to stand still in.

25:54.135 --> 25:55.470
Someone to do it with.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.099
Yeah, I had that. It's gone.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.102
So you deny yourself another shot at it?

26:04.646 --> 26:06.273
Yeah, I took a shot.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.108
I did.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.945
Took my foot off the gas
a whole five minutes, you know.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.114
Minding my own business.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.366
Even met a woman.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.412
Yeah. She was a good one, Curt.

26:22.205 --> 26:23.164
Beth.

26:24.541 --> 26:28.670
I wasn't looking for it, you know.
I didn't... I didn't see it coming.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.923
Yeah, there she was.

26:33.341 --> 26:34.342
And?

26:36.261 --> 26:38.179
I went to help the kid, you know.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.974
All hell broke loose, and she got shot.

26:42.559 --> 26:46.771
And now I've got some billionaire asshole
trying to kill me.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.690
That's because you killed his people.

26:48.773 --> 26:51.192
What was I supposed to do, Curt?
They were gonna kill the girl.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.486
No, no, no, no.
You're going after them now.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.614
-That's different.
-Look, I'm not gonna spend my life

26:55.697 --> 26:58.783
looking over my shoulder, all right?
That ain't me. That ain't you, either.

27:11.338 --> 27:12.505
You gonna follow her?

27:13.048 --> 27:14.215
Nah.

27:16.426 --> 27:20.513
If Jake is scoring meth on the streets,
I think I know where he's getting it from.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.891
-Hey, good morning.
-Good morning.

28:06.643 --> 28:07.560
Thanks for coming.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.521
Ever walk down the street,
minding your business,

28:09.604 --> 28:11.272
and a complete stranger
says something like,

28:11.356 --> 28:13.817
"Smile," or "Come on,
it's not all that bad"?

28:14.776 --> 28:16.986
Uh, no, not that I remember.

28:17.987 --> 28:21.032
Surprising. Well, that guy over there
just did that to me.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.117
I mean...

28:22.826 --> 28:26.287
my face offended a perfect stranger
I don't give a shit about.

28:29.082 --> 28:31.543
Now, if he had said that about you,

28:32.085 --> 28:33.586
I might know where he's coming from.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.635
Hey, hey, hey...
Russo's escape is unfortunate.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.096
And I can't imagine
how you feel right now.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.223
There were times in the early days

28:45.306 --> 28:47.475
I thought about having someone
place a pillow on his face

28:47.559 --> 28:49.436
just to be done with the whole thing.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.063
But you didn't.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.067
CIA doesn't operate on home soil.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.320
Besides, I needed somebody
to hang it all on.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.613
Who better than a guy in a coma

29:00.697 --> 29:02.323
that nobody ever thought
he'd come out of?

29:03.533 --> 29:05.785
Yeah, well, I guess
Billy didn't get the memo.

29:06.786 --> 29:09.622
That's the thing about guys like Russo.
And Castle.

29:10.665 --> 29:13.835
Useful until they develop
minds of their own.

29:16.129 --> 29:17.797
Castle's back in town, too.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.343
Did you have a hand in this?

29:27.307 --> 29:29.100
Hell of a chutzpah, Dinah.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.227
Can you control him?

29:32.520 --> 29:34.063
As long as my aims match his.

29:34.647 --> 29:35.648
Rafi know?

29:37.776 --> 29:40.695
So, Castle kills Russo,
and your problems are solved, right?

29:43.198 --> 29:45.700
So what the hell am I doing here,
Dinah, huh?

29:45.784 --> 29:47.368
What

29:52.040 --> 29:54.918
Advice. Perspective. A gut check.

29:55.001 --> 29:58.963
Stay out of it. Let Castle and Russo
finish off their little psychodrama.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.132
Maybe they'll kill each other this time
if we're lucky.

30:01.216 --> 30:05.303
So the CIA does operate on home soil, huh?
Just let somebody else pull the trigger.

30:05.386 --> 30:08.723
Don't you call me down here
and then pull this holier-than-thou crap.

30:11.142 --> 30:11.976
Ugh.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.479
-Marion.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.445
When my grandmother died,
my mother was so devastated.

30:25.406 --> 30:28.660
I remember the first time she didn't cry,
maybe six months later.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.957
That day she announced
she was no longer looking to feel normal,

30:34.040 --> 30:37.293
because normal no longer existed.

30:39.003 --> 30:42.131
She had to find a new normal.
I'll never forget that.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.554
But my grandmother was gone.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.016
Our shit, it's all still here.

30:53.434 --> 30:56.771
So it's been a year,
and I am still trying.

30:57.355 --> 31:01.609
It's a dirty job we do.
Not everyone can do it.

31:06.614 --> 31:08.241
Maybe I'm one of those people.

31:09.325 --> 31:11.202
I think you know exactly who you are.

31:11.286 --> 31:16.040
And I think that, sometimes,
the least worst choice is to do nothing.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.801
Hey, Jake.

31:27.552 --> 31:30.013
Hey, Curtis. What are you doing here?

31:30.680 --> 31:32.348
-I'm with him.
-Huh?

31:41.065 --> 31:42.108
Hey, Jake...

31:43.943 --> 31:46.404
I bet you want
some of this shit right now, huh?

31:47.405 --> 31:49.532
You got the wrong guy, asshole.

31:49.616 --> 31:50.617
Quiet.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.244
I get it.

31:54.162 --> 31:57.790
You were in the army,
took your SERE course,

31:57.874 --> 31:59.083
ain't gonna say shit.

31:59.959 --> 32:03.588
The bad news is I took it, too.
It ain't gonna work. Not today.

32:04.839 --> 32:06.674
You've got one thing going for you, Jake.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.551
And that is, as of now, all you are

32:08.635 --> 32:11.262
is a guy who was having a few beers
with his friends.

32:12.513 --> 32:14.641
So let's just keep it that way, okay?

32:15.934 --> 32:18.144
I need you to help me find Billy Russo.

32:19.604 --> 32:20.772
Who?

32:20.855 --> 32:23.191
Billy Russo.

32:24.275 --> 32:27.987
Jake, I hear his face is all...

32:28.529 --> 32:30.615
It's all scarred up these days.

32:30.698 --> 32:31.866
You know, what's...

32:33.034 --> 32:34.619
What's crazy about that is...

32:36.162 --> 32:37.789
see, I'm the guy who put 'em there.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.918
-I don't know him.
-No?

32:43.461 --> 32:44.462
Okay.

32:45.838 --> 32:47.340
Be smart, Jake.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.635
Why should I listen to you?

32:51.844 --> 32:53.930
I can't believe you done me like this.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.105
I know who you are.

33:02.563 --> 33:05.024
That means you know how this goes,
one way or the other.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.654
Cut me loose. Let's see what happens then.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.198
Look at you.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.367
You're strong, Jake.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.369
You're proud. You're a soldier.

33:16.452 --> 33:18.663
You're not gonna give up your brother.
I get that.

33:18.746 --> 33:19.580
I get it.

33:20.540 --> 33:21.708
Kiss my ass.

33:22.291 --> 33:23.126
Okay.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.720
Right now, you're guilty
of harboring a fugitive.

33:34.595 --> 33:37.223
Billy commits any more crimes,
then you're an accessory.

33:37.306 --> 33:40.768
Oh, shit. I remember you.

33:41.978 --> 33:45.398
That why you were at group

33:47.942 --> 33:49.902
You can't let this happen.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.072
You know I got rights.

33:55.366 --> 33:56.576
I was never here.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.832
You a bitch for the feds now?

34:04.208 --> 34:06.169
Jake, why don't you
just tell us where he is?

34:06.252 --> 34:08.629
Why don't you shut your mouth
and try that shit with me untied?

34:08.713 --> 34:11.966
Look at you, huh? All right.

34:14.469 --> 34:18.556
You wanna play, huh, Jake

34:23.728 --> 34:24.771
Do it.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.608
Come get it, Jake. Come on, come get it.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.570
That's it.

34:56.719 --> 34:57.720
Feel it?

34:58.387 --> 34:59.388
Easy.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.187
Where is he, Jake?

35:09.315 --> 35:10.858
This is your last chance.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.152
You got a permanent reminder,
you got that?

35:16.030 --> 35:19.909
Whatever comes next, Jake, is on you.
It's on you. You understand me?

35:19.992 --> 35:21.369
So, are you good with that?

35:21.452 --> 35:24.455
You think you can do this

35:25.414 --> 35:27.208
-How's it feel?

35:27.291 --> 35:28.126
Stop.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.921
One more time. Where is he?

35:37.093 --> 35:38.427
Where is he, Jake?

35:38.511 --> 35:39.720
Kiss my ass.

35:42.765 --> 35:43.808
Where is he?

35:47.311 --> 35:48.354
I said stop!

36:00.449 --> 36:02.994
I need to talk to you outside. Now.

36:09.959 --> 36:12.378
Why are you doing this, Curtis?

36:13.921 --> 36:18.134
We just need Billy, Jake.
And I know you know where he is.

36:24.098 --> 36:26.267
-You're out of control.
-Oh, Christ, don't start with me.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.060
Madani, you ain't got
the stomach for this.

36:28.144 --> 36:29.562
Just walk away.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.023
Go back to your cozy little life.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.983
Just pretend
that this shit doesn't happen.

36:34.609 --> 36:37.111
You'll see Billy's picture in the paper
when I end it.

36:38.487 --> 36:39.780
And then what does that make me?

36:42.658 --> 36:46.078
If we keep doing this, then we're
no better than Billy and Rawlins were.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.086
You know, Frank and I
have been friends with Billy

36:54.170 --> 36:58.007
since about the time
you were sprouting your first chin hairs.

36:58.507 --> 37:01.135
We didn't just train with Billy.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.263
We served with him.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.100
Covert operations.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.146
Blood doesn't make brothers
closer than that.

37:21.030 --> 37:25.284
Right up until the point
where Billy murdered Frank's whole family

37:26.244 --> 37:28.204
and shot me for getting in his way.

37:29.455 --> 37:33.417
If he did that with us, what do you think
he's gonna do with you when he's done?

37:35.086 --> 37:39.924
And the only person worse than him
is gonna be back in here any minute.

37:43.010 --> 37:44.637
Then why are you here?

37:49.100 --> 37:51.852
'Cause I'm the guy dumb enough
to get in between them.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.523
Please, don't do the same.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.948
Are you boys having fun?

38:05.324 --> 38:07.785
-Just having a little heart-to-heart.
-Yeah?

38:26.429 --> 38:27.680
All right, Jake.

38:30.558 --> 38:31.559
Come here.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.488
Where do you think
we should put this next?

38:46.824 --> 38:49.493
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay.

38:50.745 --> 38:53.080
They're hitting
the ReadyQuick check-cashing spot.

38:53.789 --> 38:56.208
This morning. Bunch of us.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.169
Right after the truck
makes the Friday drop,

38:58.252 --> 38:59.378
we're gonna rob the place.

38:59.462 --> 39:02.340
Last night, we all stayed
in that empty warehouse on 12th.

39:03.382 --> 39:04.884
I snuck out to score.

39:15.019 --> 39:17.646
Wait. I can't let you do this.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.442
I'm not asking for permission.

39:22.109 --> 39:25.780
Frank, I felt bad. I did, okay?
Everything that was done to you...

39:25.863 --> 39:28.407
So I swallowed a mountain of shit,
because I felt like I owed you.

39:28.491 --> 39:29.992
But I owe myself, too.

39:31.952 --> 39:33.037
I took an oath.

39:34.955 --> 39:38.000
I'm calling Mahoney.
Let him take Billy down.

39:40.419 --> 39:43.464
You need to get out of New York
before they come looking for you.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.051
You do what you need to do, Madani.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.109
Why did you choose a blue luchador mask?

40:03.192 --> 40:04.902
Latex allergy, asshole.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.120
Where the hell is he?

40:14.203 --> 40:15.621
You can't trust a meth head.

40:15.704 --> 40:17.623
I think our friend Jake
just became a fine example

40:17.706 --> 40:20.209
of why we always build redundancies
into our plans.

40:21.877 --> 40:25.005
José, you're now driving me.
Mike, you're off the bench.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.466
Geno, you're now flying solo
as backup, all right?

40:27.550 --> 40:29.343
What about him? He can ride with me.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.263
No. He stays right where we've got him.

40:33.556 --> 40:37.143
Just so we're clear, Jake's not getting
a goddamn cent out of this, all right?

40:37.226 --> 40:39.687
We will deal with Jake after. Let's move!

40:51.532 --> 40:52.533
Shit.

41:22.396 --> 41:23.564
Take care of that.

41:38.245 --> 41:40.539
Thank you, guys. See you next week.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.374
Thanks, guys.

42:12.738 --> 42:14.156
Hey!

42:14.240 --> 42:16.575
Get your hands up!
I wanna see hands!

42:17.117 --> 42:20.746
Everybody, stay cool. Nice and cool.

42:22.456 --> 42:23.749
That's it. Move!

42:26.669 --> 42:29.797
You, move away from the counter.

42:32.758 --> 42:33.926
Move back!

42:35.094 --> 42:36.095
That's it.

42:37.012 --> 42:42.142
Everybody stay ice cool...
and nobody dies today.

42:45.187 --> 42:47.398
You, manager. Come here.

42:52.319 --> 42:53.737
Now, what is your name?

42:54.655 --> 42:55.739
Lillian.

42:56.615 --> 42:59.368
Lillian, I'm gonna
need you to move

42:59.451 --> 43:02.246
towards whatever button you gotta push...

43:03.664 --> 43:05.791
to open that door over there.
You understand me?

43:05.874 --> 43:06.875
Perfectly.

43:07.835 --> 43:09.253
But I'm not going to do it.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.009
You're not...

43:16.135 --> 43:17.428
You're not gonna do it?

43:19.221 --> 43:20.139
You're not gonna do it.

43:21.181 --> 43:22.433
I am telling you to!

43:22.516 --> 43:23.976
That door won't open.

43:26.937 --> 43:29.189
Lillian, why are you doing this

43:29.273 --> 43:30.482
It's on a timer.

43:30.566 --> 43:32.526
There's not one person
in this entire place

43:32.610 --> 43:34.445
who believes that that door is on a timer.

43:34.945 --> 43:41.243
So trust me when I tell you
that today is not the day to do this.

43:41.827 --> 43:44.788
So give some thought
to why you wanna see tomorrow...

43:47.041 --> 43:49.335
and open the damn door.

43:49.877 --> 43:51.670
This is a family business.

43:51.754 --> 43:55.799
My daddy fought a world war,
built this place from nothing.

43:56.550 --> 43:58.761
He'd turn over in his grave if he thought

43:58.844 --> 44:02.431
I would let you all just walk in here
and take whatever you want.

44:03.724 --> 44:04.725
Okay.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.896
Does everybody know what this is?

44:11.148 --> 44:15.444
Yes, that's right! It's a grenade.
An M67 fragmentation grenade.

44:15.527 --> 44:17.613
You wouldn't believe how many
the US Army is missing.

44:17.696 --> 44:19.281
Lillian, please, just open the door.

44:19.365 --> 44:21.408
-I won't.
-It's all insured, anyway!

44:21.492 --> 44:22.576
That's not the point.

44:22.660 --> 44:26.413
Lillian... you're making me
kind of nervous.

44:26.997 --> 44:30.668
Your behavior, it's... it's erratic,
it's... it's irrational.

44:31.168 --> 44:33.629
Like you could do anything
at any time without reason.

44:33.712 --> 44:36.715
Anybody else getting the same vibe
off of Lillian, or is it just me?

44:36.799 --> 44:38.550
She a crazy old bitch.

44:38.634 --> 44:41.512
Well, I don't have time
for crazy, Lillian.

44:41.595 --> 44:43.389
So I'm gonna give you
till the count of three,

44:43.472 --> 44:45.057
and then I'm going to shove this

44:45.140 --> 44:47.518
through that little slot on the counter
right in front of you.

44:48.227 --> 44:50.729
And then you will all
really be on a timer.

44:52.064 --> 44:56.026
It won't fit, dumbass.
It's designed that way.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.903
So I'll just take my chances.

44:59.905 --> 45:02.783
You clowns are not gonna rob my joint,

45:02.866 --> 45:05.744
so just take your little sorry asses
all up outta here.

45:06.745 --> 45:08.831
-Hey! What--
-You're gonna get us all killed.

45:08.914 --> 45:10.290
Get in there! Right now!

45:10.374 --> 45:13.419
What are you... doing What?

45:14.670 --> 45:17.423
Get on the wall! Now! Hurry up!

45:17.506 --> 45:20.467
All right, everybody, put your
hands together for me just like this.

45:25.889 --> 45:26.974
Stay calm.

45:28.016 --> 45:29.017
Nice and calm.

45:30.060 --> 45:31.103
Nice and easy.

45:31.729 --> 45:32.646
Hurry up, boys!

45:37.943 --> 45:38.944
Hands.

45:41.989 --> 45:42.990
We're done!

45:44.074 --> 45:45.868
Thank you all
for your cooperation.

45:46.493 --> 45:51.123
Lillian, you're a crazy old bird,
but I think I like you.

45:51.999 --> 45:55.627
Now, if it weren't for this guy,
you would all be dead.

45:55.711 --> 45:59.214
So the next time you see him,
do the right thing.

46:00.048 --> 46:01.925
Make him employee of the month
or something.

46:03.469 --> 46:05.220
No! Wait! No! No!

46:05.304 --> 46:06.680
You're coming with us.

46:09.516 --> 46:10.726
I don't know, man.

46:10.809 --> 46:12.603
Taking him in the warehouse,
that's one thing,

46:12.686 --> 46:13.979
but on the street?

46:14.062 --> 46:15.022
We gotta slow down.

46:15.105 --> 46:18.776
No, no, no, no, no. We know where he is.
It's time, let's get this done.

46:20.527 --> 46:22.112
I still don't like it.

46:23.655 --> 46:25.532
Pull the car over. Pull it over.

46:26.116 --> 46:27.117
That's it.

46:32.289 --> 46:34.458
What are you doing? God damn it, Curtis.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.795
Look, you got too much to lose, all right?
You said it yourself.

46:38.712 --> 46:41.715
What if there's a run-and-gun, huh

46:43.884 --> 46:45.135
You know I'm right.

46:51.058 --> 46:52.684
Get the hell out of my car, Frank.

46:53.894 --> 46:56.104
-Hey, I'm gonna be right here.
-Okay.

46:56.730 --> 46:59.233
They see you coming, you know
you're not gonna have a shot, right?

46:59.316 --> 47:01.068
It's not gonna be me they see coming.

47:01.860 --> 47:05.155
Just take care of the kid.
Something happens, you take her to Madani,

47:05.239 --> 47:07.366
you tell her that I said
to tell her everything.

47:07.449 --> 47:08.575
Just do that for me.

47:09.159 --> 47:10.160
Frank...

47:12.746 --> 47:13.747
Yeah.

47:32.099 --> 47:34.101
-Look at this.
-Russo!

47:34.184 --> 47:35.978
You're late, you son of a bitch!

47:37.271 --> 47:39.690
Get out of here, Jake. Right now!

47:42.985 --> 47:43.986
Russo!

48:01.044 --> 48:02.838
You should have stayed in your hole, Bill.

48:02.921 --> 48:03.755
Billy, let's go!

48:05.173 --> 48:06.008
Come on!

48:12.848 --> 48:14.600
Let's go! Let's go!

48:16.435 --> 48:18.020
We have to go! Now!

48:19.396 --> 48:20.397
Take him down!

49:10.280 --> 49:11.990
Billy, we have to go! Now!

49:37.599 --> 49:39.184
Come on! Come on!
