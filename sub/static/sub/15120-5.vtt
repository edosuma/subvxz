00:03.441 --> 00:05.239
Goebel hasn't been seen since the
Turner House.

00:05.240 --> 00:07.081
Go to Amsterdam
and find out what was in that case.

00:07.082 --> 00:09.600
The Russians were
spying on an MI6 officer,

00:09.601 --> 00:10.881
called George Ballard.

00:10.882 --> 00:14.080
He kept a case file on something
called Hourglass.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.239
You have to do this.
No, I don't.

00:16.241 --> 00:19.040
Oh, God. What have you done.

00:19.041 --> 00:20.801
Someone's there.

00:21.841 --> 00:23.920
Why were you following Jack Turner?

00:23.921 --> 00:26.600
Following him? Do you know what he
would do if he found out?

00:26.601 --> 00:29.640
Is Miss Kent still with you?
You're being paranoid. Am I?

00:29.641 --> 00:32.439
We'll need a list of all the women
in your office who might have

00:32.441 --> 00:33.841
been followed last night.

00:33.842 --> 00:35.640
Dad, we're short 30
million quid.

00:35.641 --> 00:37.480
Kismet capitalises almost

00:37.481 --> 00:39.681
instantaneously on accidents,
disasters.

00:41.921 --> 00:43.001
He's going to blow up a building.

00:43.002 --> 00:45.321
Get out of there now,
that's an order.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

02:06.081 --> 02:08.481
Are you all right?
Can you hear me, mate?

02:18.801 --> 02:21.320
TV: '...the full extent of the
damage caused by what appears

02:21.321 --> 02:26.920
'to have been a large explosion. We
are getting reports of one fatality.

02:26.921 --> 02:29.320
'We can cross live now
to our reporter...'

02:29.321 --> 02:30.641
Good news?

02:31.921 --> 02:35.600
Our utility holdings jumped
32 million.

02:35.601 --> 02:38.160
Should be enough to satisfy
the Pakistanis.

02:38.161 --> 02:39.881
Then everything's in hand.

02:41.681 --> 02:44.081
Everything except, Alex Kent.

02:48.401 --> 02:50.681
Sam? Still no sign of her.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.321
Turner's made his millions
from this.

02:55.322 --> 02:57.760
Yep, and no-one will ever
suspect how.

02:57.761 --> 03:01.040
They're reporting a fatality at the
scene. They're saying it's a woman,

03:01.041 --> 03:03.200
but Aidan still hasn't reported in.

03:03.201 --> 03:05.200
KNOCK AT DOOR

03:05.201 --> 03:08.041
You wanted to see me?
Come in. Sit down.

03:12.041 --> 03:13.640
No need to be frightened.

03:13.641 --> 03:15.561
Am I in some kind of trouble?

03:17.721 --> 03:19.959
We just want to ask you a few
questions about the work

03:19.960 --> 03:21.761
you've been doing with Aidan Marsh.

04:04.121 --> 04:05.161
Miss Kent.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.481
How are you feeling?

04:11.281 --> 04:14.280
Like someone stepped on my head.

04:14.281 --> 04:16.360
How did I get here?

04:16.361 --> 04:18.201
You were found
unconscious on the pavement.

04:18.202 --> 04:19.801
Were you drinking last night?

04:22.561 --> 04:24.200
Just a little wine.

04:24.201 --> 04:26.400
Any history of fainting, dizziness?

04:26.401 --> 04:28.201
No.

04:30.481 --> 04:31.640
Tell you what,

04:31.641 --> 04:33.520
I think you're fine,

04:33.521 --> 04:37.000
but we'd like to keep you under
observation a bit longer. All right?

04:37.001 --> 04:40.201
OK. The nurse will be along in a
minute. Do you need anything?

04:41.241 --> 04:42.281
Could you call my boss?

04:43.641 --> 04:45.320
He might be wondering where I am.

04:45.321 --> 04:48.201
Give the number to the nurse
when she comes in.

05:09.761 --> 05:12.481
Dad...? Morning.

05:14.521 --> 05:15.801
What time is it?

05:15.802 --> 05:18.840
Time to get up.
I'll see you downstairs.

05:18.841 --> 05:20.801
Where's Alex?

05:22.241 --> 05:24.601
She went out. She'll be back soon.

05:28.801 --> 05:30.520
How's Granddad's little soldier?

05:30.521 --> 05:33.160
Good. That's my boy. You go and get
your breakfast.

05:33.161 --> 05:35.600
I need to have a word with your dad.

05:35.601 --> 05:38.360
I'll call the Pakistanis, explain
to them we don't have the funds.

05:38.361 --> 05:39.801
No, no, no there's no need for that.

05:39.802 --> 05:41.841
What do you mean?

05:43.361 --> 05:45.281
I told you I'd take care of it,
and I have.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.121
We have the 30 million?

05:49.122 --> 05:50.721
Of course.

05:52.241 --> 05:54.280
TELEPHONE RINGS

05:54.281 --> 05:59.241
Stevie...I wanted to ask
you about Alex Kent.

06:00.321 --> 06:01.960
What about her?

06:01.961 --> 06:06.720
I understand she's been gone
all night. She called you at all?

06:06.721 --> 06:09.521
Mr Stephen, it's for you.

06:12.561 --> 06:13.841
Hello...

06:18.441 --> 06:20.201
Where is it?

06:25.441 --> 06:27.000
There a problem?

06:27.001 --> 06:31.921
Yeah, Stephen Turner's on a call in the library.
I can't get the bloody volume.

06:33.081 --> 06:35.400
FROM SPEAKER: 'All right, I see.'

06:35.401 --> 06:37.400
Well, sure.
If you'd shown me that before.

06:37.401 --> 06:42.040
'Yeah, OK. Yeah, that's right,
can you give me the address.'

06:42.041 --> 06:43.801
No, no I understand. Thank you.

06:45.961 --> 06:49.560
That was the Royal Hospital.
Alex collapsed last night

06:49.561 --> 06:51.361
on her way back to the house.

06:54.161 --> 06:55.480
What's happened?

06:55.481 --> 06:59.640
I can't reach Aidan. And Sam never
returned from Conroy's last night.

06:59.641 --> 07:00.801
I gathered that much.

07:05.641 --> 07:07.081
What about the cheese then?

07:09.681 --> 07:11.920
Zoe. Sam's in the Royal Hospital.
She all right?

07:11.921 --> 07:15.440
I'm guessing its cover for her late return,
but Fowkes still can't reach Aidan.

07:15.441 --> 07:17.320
If he shows up, send him to us.

07:17.321 --> 07:19.321
What for?

07:20.641 --> 07:22.641
We got a situation.

07:49.321 --> 07:53.760
Good morning, Miss Kent.
Or should I say, Miss Hunter?

07:53.761 --> 07:56.120
It's all right.
I'm not here to hurt you.

07:56.121 --> 07:58.360
You injected me with something.

07:58.361 --> 07:59.760
A sedative.

07:59.761 --> 08:01.201
Why?

08:02.161 --> 08:03.640
I need to talk to you.

08:03.641 --> 08:06.880
You jab me in the eye just
so you can talk to me?

08:06.881 --> 08:08.680
And to demonstrate my good will.

08:08.681 --> 08:12.360
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead, obviously.

08:12.361 --> 08:15.280
You didn't need to put me
in a hospital bed for that.

08:15.281 --> 08:21.120
The hospital explains your absence,
both to the Turners and Byzantium.

08:21.121 --> 08:22.321
So, talk.

08:27.521 --> 08:29.801
I'll just put these in water.

08:50.281 --> 08:51.361
Your life is in danger.

08:51.362 --> 08:53.120
No shit.

08:53.121 --> 08:55.880
Unfortunately, I arrived
in Tangier too late.

08:55.881 --> 08:58.321
I spent the past year
searching for you.

08:59.961 --> 09:03.001
By the time I found you, you were
already in the Turner house.

09:04.881 --> 09:07.401
You impersonated Horst Goebel,
just to get to me.

09:08.921 --> 09:12.840
I could hardly enter that house as
myself. And the real Horst Goebel?

09:12.841 --> 09:17.721
Sedated, like you.
Though, he never woke up.

09:19.121 --> 09:23.321
I need to take you somewhere safe.
Beyond their reach.

09:24.601 --> 09:25.641
You mean Hourglass.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.199
I'm not authorised to discuss that.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.641
I'm not going anywhere with you.

09:32.881 --> 09:37.001
Your absence now would raise too
many questions.

09:38.121 --> 09:41.520
But time is running out.
Byzantium will soon realise the danger you are in.

09:41.521 --> 09:43.400
You mustn't trust anyone.

09:43.401 --> 09:47.000
Especially, if they say they're
trying to help you.

09:47.001 --> 09:48.161
You mean like you.

09:50.961 --> 09:53.281
Oh, you can put back the knife now.

09:57.081 --> 09:59.881
How did they know
I was at that cafe?

10:00.961 --> 10:04.201
It was intemperate of you to have an
affair with a colleague.

10:08.921 --> 10:10.241
Aidan.

10:21.361 --> 10:22.560
You, OK?

10:22.561 --> 10:26.721
Something wrong, Deacon? You don't
seem your usual, jolly self.

10:28.521 --> 10:30.121
I need to ask you some questions.

10:31.401 --> 10:33.361
Let's talk later.
I want to go check on Sam.

10:35.361 --> 10:37.241
Let's talk now.

10:40.641 --> 10:41.721
Of course.

10:42.881 --> 10:44.961
SHE MOUTHS

10:54.881 --> 10:58.881
Hello, Mr Ballard,
Mr Keel is waiting for you.

11:06.961 --> 11:08.481
Hello, George.

11:09.721 --> 11:11.440
You're looking very well.

11:11.441 --> 11:13.681
I look like shit. So do you.

11:15.281 --> 11:17.961
Tea. Earl Grey with lemon.
Right away.

11:21.841 --> 11:24.240
It's good to see you again.

11:24.241 --> 11:27.160
Nostalgia's the last thing I'd
expect from you, Rupert.

11:27.161 --> 11:31.840
You were an excellent analyst,
the best MI6 had.

11:31.841 --> 11:36.121
And you were a brilliant strategist.
Always two steps ahead.

11:37.841 --> 11:40.440
I suppose that's why you're sitting
here in a bespoke suit,

11:40.441 --> 11:43.321
while I'm living in Croydon
on a government wage.

11:44.801 --> 11:46.320
Well, you were an idealist.

11:46.321 --> 11:48.921
You make it sound like a dirty word.

11:50.601 --> 11:54.360
I like to think there are still
certain causes worth fighting for.

11:54.361 --> 11:55.921
That's a pretty thought.

11:57.961 --> 12:02.760
So, why did you ask to see me
again after all these years?

12:02.761 --> 12:05.681
An operative of ours, Sam Hunter.

12:06.761 --> 12:08.881
Don't pretend you don't know
who she is.

12:11.361 --> 12:13.321
Or that she disappeared for
the past year.

12:15.681 --> 12:20.441
You can believe...anything you like.

12:24.721 --> 12:27.000
She's mixed up in something.

12:27.001 --> 12:28.961
I'm not sure what...

12:31.081 --> 12:32.881
..but I'm beginning to get an idea.

12:35.161 --> 12:37.361
How's this for a blank face?

12:39.361 --> 12:40.481
Hourglass.

12:46.361 --> 12:47.960
I thought as much.

12:47.961 --> 12:52.120
I don't know what Hourglass is,
Rupert.

12:52.121 --> 12:53.281
Of course you don't.

12:56.281 --> 12:58.201
Enjoy your tea, George.

13:06.841 --> 13:09.081
Alex.

13:12.601 --> 13:14.600
How you feeling?

13:14.601 --> 13:15.960
I'm fine.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.120
She had us worried, didn't she,
Eddie? Yeah.

13:19.121 --> 13:20.760
Are you all right?

13:20.761 --> 13:22.281
I am, if you are.

13:26.161 --> 13:27.401
So, can we take you home now or...?

13:27.402 --> 13:31.920
The doctor wants me to stay for a few
hours of observation. Just to be sure.

13:31.921 --> 13:34.720
Will you be home
when I get back from school?

13:34.721 --> 13:37.201
I hope so.

13:44.561 --> 13:46.281
You know what this
is about, don't you?

13:46.282 --> 13:48.281
Surprise party?

13:49.681 --> 13:51.881
We've got a mole on the team.

13:54.441 --> 13:57.800
Run by MI6 officer Natalie Thorpe.

13:57.801 --> 13:59.641
Is that so?

14:03.761 --> 14:06.681
You know it is. You're the mole.

14:08.041 --> 14:09.881
That kind of hurts my feelings,
Deacon.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.961
After all the ops we've worked
together.

14:14.801 --> 14:16.161
Imagine how I feel?

14:18.041 --> 14:19.281
Losing Hasan...

14:23.761 --> 14:27.121
..because someone on my team was
spying for six.

14:30.401 --> 14:31.721
What makes you think it was me?

14:38.401 --> 14:40.760
Do you want to leave this
room in a body bag?

14:40.761 --> 14:42.361
That wouldn't be my preference, no.

14:42.362 --> 14:45.600
Then here's how it works.
I ask the questions, you answer.

14:45.601 --> 14:48.840
Or you don't leave this room. Ever.

14:48.841 --> 14:49.881
PHONE RINGS

14:52.041 --> 14:55.240
Sam. What have I missed?
'That building exploded...'

14:55.241 --> 14:58.320
Turner secured his 30 million
quid, thanks to Lewis Conroy.

14:58.321 --> 14:59.521
What about Aidan?

15:00.841 --> 15:04.640
He's being held at Byzantium.
Crane thinks he's the mole.

15:04.641 --> 15:06.760
I'll be in touch.

15:06.761 --> 15:11.160
Yesterday you instructed
Simran Bains to make unauthorised

15:11.161 --> 15:15.560
inquiries into something
called Hourglass.

15:15.561 --> 15:17.160
Why?

15:17.161 --> 15:19.720
I'd love to tell you
Deacon, I really would.

15:19.721 --> 15:21.040
Then do it.

15:21.041 --> 15:24.041
Once you've proved to me
that you're not the mole.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.840
Me?

15:38.841 --> 15:41.200
I'd hardly make "authorised"
inquiries, would I?

15:41.201 --> 15:44.161
When anyone on my team might be
the one who got Hasan killed?

15:46.281 --> 15:48.241
You're pulling this out of your ass.

15:48.242 --> 15:50.880
I'm not the mole, Deacon.
And I'm not going to answer

15:50.881 --> 15:53.361
any more questions
until I know you not, either.

15:55.481 --> 15:58.361
Look who's pulling up to
the Big Brother house now.

16:08.521 --> 16:10.880
What did you do to her, Lewis?

16:10.881 --> 16:13.040
Alex Kent. She's in hospital.

16:13.041 --> 16:15.560
In hospital? What for?

16:15.561 --> 16:19.401
Well, she fainted on the pavement.
You must have been too much for her.

16:21.081 --> 16:24.241
I came here to tell you,
I'm done, Jack.

16:25.721 --> 16:30.480
Done? What do you mean, done?

16:30.481 --> 16:34.200
This whole business. I've made
enough money, so have you.

16:34.201 --> 16:37.841
Since when has anyone ever made
"enough" money?

16:39.081 --> 16:43.881
A woman was killed in that
explosion, and Vince...

16:45.201 --> 16:47.520
You don't seem to understand, Lewis.

16:47.521 --> 16:50.000
You don't stop
until I tell you to stop.

16:50.001 --> 16:53.080
Did you bring the list
I asked you for?

16:53.081 --> 16:55.560
No, I didn't bring the bloody list.

16:55.561 --> 16:59.200
I'm not having you investigate
my friends, the people I work with.

16:59.201 --> 17:02.360
The woman you saw at the university
might be the same woman who

17:02.361 --> 17:05.641
broke into your office last night.
You think I don't know that?

17:07.401 --> 17:09.920
I keep expecting the police to
bust in my door at any second.

17:09.921 --> 17:12.280
Whoever she is, she's not the police.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.880
Then who is she?

17:14.881 --> 17:16.281
You let us worry about that.

17:16.281 --> 17:18.281
Go home, you've done well for us
today.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.201
I'll see you out.
I can see myself out.

17:33.441 --> 17:35.761
He's become a problem, hasn't he?

17:41.281 --> 17:44.240
Let's get our ducks in a row first.

17:44.241 --> 17:46.681
You dig up what you can about that
break-in last night.

17:51.401 --> 17:53.480
Where are you going, sir?

17:53.481 --> 17:55.721
Me? I fancy a drink down my local.

18:00.081 --> 18:03.520
Should I follow them?
Yeah, you'd better. I'll tell Crane.

18:03.521 --> 18:04.880
Where you going?

18:04.881 --> 18:06.560
Conroy's flat. What for?

18:06.561 --> 18:08.441
Turner's going to be looking for
the woman that

18:08.442 --> 18:11.800
saw him murder the professor,
then broke into Conroy's office.

18:11.801 --> 18:13.281
We have to make sure he finds her.

18:21.761 --> 18:23.841
He suspects you.

18:25.441 --> 18:26.760
He's playing for time.

18:26.761 --> 18:28.441
Come with me.

18:31.241 --> 18:32.800
AIDAN COUGHS

18:32.801 --> 18:34.001
Get it open!

18:50.441 --> 18:52.760
Aidan's escaped.
Is he still in the building?

18:52.761 --> 18:54.041
All exits are sealed.

18:54.042 --> 18:56.521
Mr Marsh, raise your hands.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.360
Two more guards down.

19:17.361 --> 19:18.921
Let's split up.

19:38.001 --> 19:40.200
Aidan, you're not going to shoot me.

19:40.201 --> 19:42.441
I didn't betray you.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.520
Anything?

20:54.521 --> 20:57.200
We have all eyes on the airports
and train stations.

20:57.201 --> 20:58.401
Not that he'd be that stupid.

20:58.402 --> 21:00.320
He said "I didn't betray you."

21:00.321 --> 21:01.521
And you believe him?

21:01.522 --> 21:03.601
He could've killed us both,
and didn't.

21:30.761 --> 21:34.280
I thought you wanted this
to be over?

21:34.281 --> 21:37.040
It is over now.
Byzantium found me out.

21:37.041 --> 21:38.560
When?

21:38.561 --> 21:41.681
This morning.
I managed to escape the building.

21:43.761 --> 21:44.881
We'll relocate you.

21:46.041 --> 21:48.000
I need to fix this.

21:48.001 --> 21:49.521
This can't be fixed.

21:57.881 --> 22:01.960
I need to have a meeting with your
boss. I want to meet George Ballard.

22:01.961 --> 22:03.160
Ballard?

22:03.161 --> 22:05.361
He's got a case file on something
called Hourglass.

22:05.362 --> 22:07.040
How do you know who I report to?

22:07.041 --> 22:10.560
Or what case files he has?
Natalie...

22:10.561 --> 22:11.721
I need answers.

22:11.722 --> 22:14.480
I don't have them.
I've never heard of Hourglass.

22:14.481 --> 22:16.160
Neither had I.

22:16.161 --> 22:20.601
But whatever it is, it has something to
do with who tried to kill Sam in Tangier.

22:22.121 --> 22:23.601
I see how talking to Ballard

22:23.602 --> 22:26.040
might help her.
I don't see how it helps you.

22:26.041 --> 22:29.161
Those gunmen nearly killed Sam
because of intel that I gave you.

22:31.801 --> 22:35.401
You should want to know how and why they
got that information, just as much as her.

22:37.761 --> 22:40.521
I know you'll just tell me
what you think I need to hear...

22:43.001 --> 22:44.241
..but when you were with me...

22:46.041 --> 22:47.241
..was it all just an act?

22:53.561 --> 22:55.801
At least when you don't talk,
I know you're not lying.

23:03.481 --> 23:04.681
GUN COCKS

23:24.881 --> 23:26.961
Thanks for not shooting.

23:32.201 --> 23:33.801
I won't hurt you, Sam.

23:42.761 --> 23:47.680
Go ahead, pull the trigger.
But I'm on your side.

23:47.681 --> 23:50.400
You're the mole.

23:50.401 --> 23:54.880
I didn't have any choice, but I couldn't
tell you that without compromising you, too.

23:54.881 --> 23:57.960
You told MI6 where I'd be.

23:57.961 --> 24:02.560
I didn't know anyone would try to
kill you. Neither did she.

24:02.561 --> 24:03.881
You're lying.

24:06.281 --> 24:11.201
I did lie.
I had to. But I'm not lying now.

24:15.001 --> 24:16.481
Sam, I know about Hourglass.

24:20.641 --> 24:21.681
How do you know?

24:24.721 --> 24:27.001
I found your hidden room.

24:29.041 --> 24:30.081
I know everything.

24:31.561 --> 24:33.601
That's how I got caught.
Trying to help you.

24:35.881 --> 24:38.000
And I can't go back to Byzantium.

24:38.001 --> 24:39.121
I need answers.

24:40.601 --> 24:41.721
Just like you.

25:05.441 --> 25:08.321
What brings you to this dump, Jack?

25:10.681 --> 25:11.921
Come on in, son.

25:11.922 --> 25:14.080
I want you to meet an old
friend of mine.

25:14.081 --> 25:15.520
All right.

25:15.521 --> 25:16.641
Brilliant.

25:26.841 --> 25:31.760
Jack Turner, I never expected to see
you back in these parts again.

25:31.761 --> 25:33.519
Well, you need a passport
these days.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.481
But we're still holding the fort,
ain't we?

25:35.482 --> 25:38.200
Long time since we raised
glasses in here, eh, Dave?

25:38.201 --> 25:39.481
Too long, Jack.

25:39.482 --> 25:42.521
I want you to meet
a friend of mine, Gary.

25:47.521 --> 25:48.601
Gary.

25:58.121 --> 26:01.600
Gary's a useful lad.
He helped Tyrone with those jobs.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.841
I don't know what jobs you're
talking about, Dave.

26:04.841 --> 26:07.120
Oh, of course, yeah. Sorry.

26:07.121 --> 26:09.640
Why don't you show me that little
item you're holding for me?

26:09.641 --> 26:10.681
Yeah. Of course, Jack.

26:21.561 --> 26:23.081
It's down here, I think.

26:28.481 --> 26:31.681
Here we are. Safe and sound.

26:43.761 --> 26:44.801
Everything in order?

26:46.241 --> 26:47.441
Now put it somewhere else.

26:48.561 --> 26:50.800
No-one comes in here, Jack.
Just do it.

26:50.801 --> 26:51.921
All right.

26:53.801 --> 26:55.041
Now, who's this Gary?

26:57.241 --> 26:58.721
OK.

26:59.921 --> 27:02.120
She talked to Ballard.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.080
He won't meet with me.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.601
Just you, alone.

27:08.121 --> 27:10.360
Where? West wing
of the National Gallery.

27:10.361 --> 27:12.361
In front of a painting called
"The Ambassadors."

27:14.201 --> 27:16.561
If there's trouble meet me
at the back?

27:39.961 --> 27:41.721
DOORBELL BUZZES

27:46.241 --> 27:48.280
Trudy, what are you doing here?

27:48.281 --> 27:49.401
Why aren't you at work?

27:50.641 --> 27:51.881
I haven't been feeling well.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.121
Well, you could at least
pick up the phone.

27:57.961 --> 28:01.040
There's a man called Bingham
at the office. Bingham...

28:01.041 --> 28:03.280
He works for Jack Turner.

28:03.281 --> 28:05.160
I know who he is.

28:05.161 --> 28:08.320
Well, he said that you authorised
him to look through your files.

28:08.321 --> 28:10.561
I told him he couldn't touch a thing
until I spoke to you.

28:12.441 --> 28:13.481
Go ahead.

28:15.441 --> 28:16.481
Let him look.

28:17.841 --> 28:20.201
Why? What's he looking for?

28:24.361 --> 28:26.161
Is this about the break-in
last night?

28:28.961 --> 28:32.961
Lewis, if you're in some kind
of trouble, please, just tell me.

28:35.481 --> 28:36.521
Trudy...

28:38.961 --> 28:40.801
I didn't treat you very well, did I?

28:43.601 --> 28:45.521
I don't have any hard feelings.

28:47.281 --> 28:50.641
Mark and I... We're very happy.

28:51.841 --> 28:54.121
I'd really like to help you,
if I can.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.641
Could you hold that for me, please?
Sure.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.120
Trudy Barnes.

29:18.121 --> 29:21.880
Conroy's secretary of four years.
They had an affair last summer,

29:21.881 --> 29:24.361
while she was engaged to be married
to this man, Mark Rothman.

29:24.362 --> 29:26.520
He was away serving a third
tour of Afghanistan.

29:26.521 --> 29:31.160
What happened? From their text messages
it appears Conroy just got tired of her.

29:31.161 --> 29:32.760
And her fiance?

29:32.761 --> 29:34.441
Now her husband.

29:36.321 --> 29:40.241
That works for us. You make sure
Turner gets their names.

29:42.121 --> 29:43.361
You know what he'll do.

29:44.801 --> 29:46.201
That's the point, isn't it?

29:47.361 --> 29:50.080
These are innocents.
There must be another way.

29:50.081 --> 29:51.401
I'm open to suggestions.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.121
Zoe found something in Amsterdam.

29:59.121 --> 30:01.561
Er, yes, Horst Goebel.

30:02.761 --> 30:05.880
His body was found floating in the
Keizersgracht canal three weeks ago.

30:05.881 --> 30:08.440
I identified him
from prints I lifted at his lab.

30:08.441 --> 30:09.640
Murdered.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.001
Slipped and drowned, officially.

30:11.002 --> 30:12.720
After he left the Turner house?

30:12.721 --> 30:14.201
He was never at the Turner house.

30:18.881 --> 30:21.480
Whoever our imposter was,
I believe he murdered Goebel

30:21.481 --> 30:22.921
and then took his place.

30:53.641 --> 30:58.360
After nearly five hundred years,
its meaning remains obscure,

30:58.361 --> 31:00.120
even to scholars.

31:00.121 --> 31:02.401
You ask me here to talk about art,
Mr Ballard?

31:03.641 --> 31:08.800
A subject which bores me to tears.
Except for this particular picture.

31:08.801 --> 31:11.000
It was painted in 1533.

31:11.001 --> 31:14.521
A period of intense economic
unrest in Europe, not unlike today.

31:15.801 --> 31:18.400
Some think it was
commissioned by a French ambassador,

31:18.401 --> 31:21.720
but I believe it was
British merchants.

31:21.721 --> 31:23.560
Is this supposed to interest me?

31:23.561 --> 31:25.160
It should.

31:25.161 --> 31:29.040
These merchants felt constrained
by their governments who wrote

31:29.041 --> 31:32.001
the laws and levied the taxes,
so they formed a secret pact.

31:33.801 --> 31:35.281
They called it Hourglass.

31:37.321 --> 31:39.480
You see the skull.

31:39.481 --> 31:42.800
It's distorted,
the artist's way of telling us,

31:42.801 --> 31:44.001
"Things are not what they seem."

31:44.002 --> 31:46.520
Everything in this painting is a
clue.

31:46.521 --> 31:48.320
A clue to what?

31:48.321 --> 31:49.960
Their plot.

31:49.961 --> 31:52.160
To concentrate
the world's wealth, power

31:52.161 --> 31:54.680
and influence into private hands.

31:54.681 --> 31:56.680
To undermine the power
of governments,

31:56.681 --> 31:58.321
without arousing
the ire of the people.

31:58.322 --> 32:00.160
Over the years, these conspirators

32:00.161 --> 32:05.720
evolved into five major
multinational corporations.

32:05.721 --> 32:09.281
It took them five centuries,
but they've finally succeeded.

32:14.561 --> 32:17.880
Even if all of this is true, I don't
see what it has to do with me.

32:17.881 --> 32:20.320
They've spent
so much time trying to find you.

32:20.321 --> 32:22.960
You obviously pose some
kind of a threat.

32:22.961 --> 32:24.360
I don't see how.

32:24.361 --> 32:27.001
Then you have no idea why they've
tried to kill you?

32:33.481 --> 32:35.279
I had been hoping that you might be

32:35.280 --> 32:37.201
what I've been looking for
all these years.

32:38.601 --> 32:40.681
A way to expose them
for what they are.

32:41.801 --> 32:45.321
A plague on civilisation, bent on
destroying it to enrich themselves.

32:47.401 --> 32:49.441
You've got the wrong girl,
Mr Ballard.

32:51.321 --> 32:53.921
You're going to have to be even
more careful, now.

32:55.561 --> 32:58.001
Rupert Keel knows that Hourglass
is interested in you.

32:59.881 --> 33:01.361
What's Keel's connection?

33:01.362 --> 33:05.280
Three members of the Byzantium
board of directors are CEOs

33:05.281 --> 33:08.200
of Hourglass corporations.

33:08.201 --> 33:12.321
Whichever corporation wants you dead
doesn't want anyone to know.

33:13.481 --> 33:15.121
What is it? Come with me.

33:33.081 --> 33:34.121
He's right behind us.

33:42.961 --> 33:45.121
You didn't lose him, did you?
Not a chance.

34:07.561 --> 34:09.321
Stop them...

34:10.920 --> 34:14.281
You must stop them...

35:17.441 --> 35:18.521
What's on your mind?

35:21.401 --> 35:22.961
You think God sees everything?

35:24.161 --> 35:25.201
If there is a God.

35:25.202 --> 35:29.880
A question for which I've seen
precious little evidence lately.

35:29.881 --> 35:32.640
Be careful, Father.
You'll lose your job.

35:32.641 --> 35:34.481
You didn't come here to
talk about me.

35:42.161 --> 35:44.881
I've done a lot of bad
things in my life.

35:48.681 --> 35:50.161
What is it?

35:54.841 --> 35:56.801
Two people are going to die.

35:58.161 --> 36:01.160
People I've never met.

36:01.161 --> 36:03.921
Haven't done anything wrong.
You can't stop it?

36:08.841 --> 36:09.961
I'm the cause of it.

36:11.481 --> 36:14.241
It's something my job
compels me to do.

36:15.681 --> 36:18.441
Whoever you work for, I don't think
they pay you enough for that.

36:19.841 --> 36:23.961
If I don't let them die,
then one of my colleagues will.

36:25.201 --> 36:28.521
The church allows for killing
in self-defence.

36:30.481 --> 36:33.201
Or a "just" war, whatever that is.

36:35.041 --> 36:36.360
This is neither.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.361
Then you have to stop it.

36:43.561 --> 36:46.361
It won't stop blood being spilled.

36:49.801 --> 36:52.241
I'm not going to pretend I know
if there's an all-seeing God.

36:53.881 --> 36:57.640
But I do know,
if you commit a mortal sin

36:57.641 --> 37:02.961
it kills the soul, as surely
as a fatal disease kills the body.

37:07.841 --> 37:09.360
Do you have any idea who that was?

37:09.361 --> 37:12.241
He killed Emma Freeman.
And tried to kill me.

37:13.281 --> 37:14.961
Those steps you fell down,
that was him.

37:14.962 --> 37:16.960
He offered Hasan money to kill me.

37:16.961 --> 37:19.561
What...?
I killed him in self-defence.

37:21.201 --> 37:22.361
Well, that's a relief.

37:27.241 --> 37:28.281
A relief...?

37:31.481 --> 37:32.641
What?

37:36.001 --> 37:37.081
I betrayed Hasan.

37:40.521 --> 37:42.881
Why? You told me Keel was looking
for a mole.

37:47.401 --> 37:48.761
So, you got Hasan captured...

37:50.521 --> 37:51.681
..to protect yourself.

37:53.401 --> 37:55.001
Sam, it was him or me.

37:56.441 --> 37:57.521
You put me in danger.

37:59.041 --> 38:01.601
I knew you'd be ordered to kill him.
And you did.

38:33.201 --> 38:35.441
Dave tells me you were in the Army.
Yeah, that's right.

38:35.442 --> 38:37.000
Did my four years.

38:37.001 --> 38:39.600
Four years? Good lad.

38:39.601 --> 38:42.840
Queen and country.
What were you then?

38:42.841 --> 38:44.360
SAS?

38:44.361 --> 38:47.481
Nah, just a squaddie. Essex boy.

38:50.001 --> 38:51.921
In the Anglians.

38:54.561 --> 38:56.721
So what are you doing
messing about in this dump?

38:56.722 --> 38:59.600
Be fair, Jack. He's a good bloke.

38:59.601 --> 39:02.201
I tell you what, he reminds me
a bit of young Jack Jr.

39:04.601 --> 39:05.721
Does he, Dave?

39:07.681 --> 39:09.161
Does he?

39:14.121 --> 39:16.961
Dave is referring to my eldest, John.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.880
Perhaps you do look alike.

39:21.881 --> 39:22.921
Can't see it myself.

39:25.041 --> 39:28.361
Are you brave, Gary?
Are you loyal?

39:30.361 --> 39:32.601
Are you the sort of son
to make your father proud?

39:33.761 --> 39:35.320
Well, I hope so. For your sake...

39:35.321 --> 39:37.161
For your Dad's sake.

39:39.121 --> 39:41.041
But I tell you what, Gary...

39:42.921 --> 39:45.640
I hope you don't end up dead,

39:45.641 --> 39:48.600
cut to pieces with your dick
stuffed in your mouth.

39:48.601 --> 39:52.680
I'm sorry, Jack, I didn't mean...
Just turn up the telly, Dave.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.001
What?

39:55.281 --> 39:57.520
I said turn up the sodding telly.

39:57.521 --> 39:59.120
Yeah. Sorry. Of course.

39:59.121 --> 40:03.200
TELEVISION: '...the threat these economic
hit men pose to the developing world.'

40:03.201 --> 40:04.361
'Forgive me, Madam Zahir,

40:04.362 --> 40:07.080
'but it seems you are making very
strong accusations.'

40:07.081 --> 40:08.400
'I am.

40:08.401 --> 40:10.440
'I want people to become angry

40:10.441 --> 40:14.040
'and inflamed about the corrupt
elements in our country.'

40:14.041 --> 40:16.401
'You're referring to the
privatisation of the Khyber Dam.'

40:16.402 --> 40:18.000
'It's a scandal.

40:18.001 --> 40:23.481
'And I intend to expose and stop it,
if I'm elected president.'

41:27.921 --> 41:28.961
Mr Keel.

41:33.321 --> 41:36.240
I told you Aidan was
looking into an MI6 case file.

41:36.241 --> 41:39.360
Belonging to a section chief
named George Ballard. Yes?

41:39.361 --> 41:43.401
Ballard was just found dead, outside
the National Gallery.

41:50.761 --> 41:53.360
There are seven members
of the Byzantium board of directors.

41:53.361 --> 41:56.160
Ballard said three of them
are Hourglass conspirators.

41:56.161 --> 41:59.920
So where do we start?
Hector Stokes, CEO of Polyhedrus,

41:59.921 --> 42:02.840
the third largest privately held
corporation in the world.

42:02.841 --> 42:05.640
Polyhedrus built the dam in Pakistan
the Turners are bidding on.

42:05.641 --> 42:08.281
Do you think there's a connection?
I'm guessing there is.

42:14.161 --> 42:16.521
When did you start spying for MI6?

42:17.961 --> 42:20.041
Two years, seven months,
eight days ago.

42:22.841 --> 42:24.161
Why did you do it?

42:27.041 --> 42:31.121
The lovely Miss Thorpe
was blackmailing me. For what?

42:47.721 --> 42:49.441
Aidan Marsh isn't my real name.

42:50.881 --> 42:53.201
It's an identity
I assumed a long time ago.

42:58.281 --> 43:00.681
If you're not Aidan Marsh,
then who are you?

43:03.081 --> 43:04.520
Better you don't know.

43:04.521 --> 43:06.201
I said, who are you?

43:09.881 --> 43:11.840
I don't know where you grew up,

43:11.841 --> 43:15.560
whether your mum had a temper, your
dad drank too much before dinner.

43:15.561 --> 43:17.560
I don't know
anything about your past.

43:17.561 --> 43:21.521
But I know how you think.
I know how you feel.

43:24.281 --> 43:25.321
I know you, Sam.

43:26.961 --> 43:28.561
Better than anyone else
in the world.

43:28.562 --> 43:31.081
If that's supposed to make me
trust you, it doesn't.

43:33.521 --> 43:34.801
I'm trusting you.

43:34.802 --> 43:38.200
Until now, Natalie Thorpe was
the only person in the world that

43:38.201 --> 43:39.841
knew I'd lied about my identity.

43:41.281 --> 43:43.241
Now you know it, too.

43:49.641 --> 43:52.720
Keep walking, Natalie, if you don't
want to be seen with me.

43:52.721 --> 43:54.600
What is it you want, Mr Keel?

43:54.601 --> 43:57.360
To offer my condolences
for the murdered George Ballard.

43:57.361 --> 43:58.559
He was a good man.

43:58.560 --> 44:00.681
Thank you, but he wasn't murdered.
He died of a heart attack.

44:00.682 --> 44:03.201
Is that the story you're peddling?

44:04.721 --> 44:06.880
You've infiltrated my organisation
with a mole,

44:06.881 --> 44:08.761
and now your direct
superior is dead.

44:08.762 --> 44:10.520
I need to know why.

44:10.521 --> 44:11.881
I've told you before, Mr Keel.

44:11.882 --> 44:15.320
I'm not one of your lackeys,
I work for Her Majesty's Government.

44:15.321 --> 44:17.080
Well, that's where you're wrong.

44:17.081 --> 44:20.080
You've already collected ã80,000
in unreported income.

44:20.081 --> 44:22.399
I started making
payments into a Swiss bank account

44:22.400 --> 44:24.321
I opened in your name
after our last meeting.

44:24.322 --> 44:25.681
You're setting me up.

44:26.681 --> 44:28.001
You won't be able to
make it stick.

44:28.002 --> 44:31.440
How many years will it take
to prove your innocence?

44:31.441 --> 44:34.080
And what kind of career will you
have by that point?

44:34.081 --> 44:35.121
What do you want?

44:35.122 --> 44:37.361
Everything. Everything you know.

44:41.841 --> 44:44.600
Eddie, how was your day?

44:44.601 --> 44:46.720
It was fine, thanks. Where's Alex?

44:46.721 --> 44:49.600
She's not back from hospital, yet.

44:49.601 --> 44:51.441
What's this?

44:55.281 --> 44:56.801
Do you think she'll like it?

45:06.801 --> 45:11.041
Mr Bingham...find your way all right?

45:15.961 --> 45:17.001
Excuse me.

45:23.081 --> 45:25.720
I found her. Who is it?

45:25.721 --> 45:28.640
Conroy's secretary, Trudy Barnes.

45:28.641 --> 45:29.921
What makes you think it's her?

45:29.922 --> 45:33.560
A got a little bit of information
from Conroy's e-mail account.

45:33.561 --> 45:36.040
He was sleeping with her
until last July.

45:36.041 --> 45:39.920
So...? Two months later
she marries another man.

45:39.921 --> 45:43.240
Ex-military. They're already having
financial problems.

45:43.241 --> 45:47.280
What, you think she intends
to blackmail Lewis?

45:47.281 --> 45:49.840
You saw a man and woman
at the university that night.

45:49.841 --> 45:53.841
Last night there was a man
and a woman at Conroy's office.

45:58.761 --> 46:00.841
Check it out.

46:25.001 --> 46:26.641
Let's find another way in.

46:46.601 --> 46:49.000
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out!

46:49.001 --> 46:50.281
What is it?

46:51.921 --> 46:53.161
Sam?

48:12.561 --> 48:16.840
Let me out! Let me out!

48:16.841 --> 48:18.161
I've been here before.

48:39.921 --> 48:41.601
What is this place?

48:47.801 --> 48:49.241
I was taken here...

48:51.841 --> 48:53.001
..as a child.

49:09.721 --> 49:12.761
Let me out! Let me out!

49:18.961 --> 49:20.961
CAR APPROACHES

49:25.721 --> 49:27.321
Sam, we need to go.

52:03.161 --> 52:04.201
You off, Jack?

52:05.561 --> 52:09.921
I've got something for Tyrone.
Everett will need to clean up after.

52:11.081 --> 52:13.480
Tyrone's got his hands
full at the moment.

52:13.481 --> 52:15.441
Why not use Gary over there?

52:16.961 --> 52:19.960
I don't like the smell of your
friend Gary.

52:19.961 --> 52:23.320
He's a good bloke, Jack.
You ought to give him a chance.

52:23.321 --> 52:25.081
You telling me what to do now, Dave?

52:25.082 --> 52:27.721
You know me better than that.

53:11.841 --> 53:13.600
Yeah.

53:13.601 --> 53:16.280
'Are you back in London yet?'
Yeah, did you clean up?

53:16.281 --> 53:18.040
That was quite a mess you left.

53:18.041 --> 53:19.360
What about Byzantium?

53:19.361 --> 53:22.000
I cleaned that up, too. How?

53:22.001 --> 53:24.521
Listen to me. Very carefully.

54:12.001 --> 54:14.281
Alex, you're back!

54:16.001 --> 54:18.560
Will you read The Snow Maiden to me?
You know I will.

54:18.561 --> 54:20.881
Come see me after you put Edward
to bed, will you? Sure.

55:01.201 --> 55:02.441
Who are you?

55:16.721 --> 55:17.801
All right, thanks.

55:20.961 --> 55:23.881
The police have arrived.
They found the bodies.

55:32.161 --> 55:33.961
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

55:33.962 --> 55:36.280
Dragged myself in, actually.

55:36.281 --> 55:38.880
I knew you'd catch up with me in
the end. As I told you before...

55:38.881 --> 55:41.801
Right. You're innocent.

55:43.321 --> 55:44.361
So I hear.

55:46.721 --> 55:48.600
Hasan was the mole.

55:48.601 --> 55:49.921
Hasan...?

55:51.641 --> 55:55.040
We think someone at six tripped him
up, got him caught by the Turners.

55:55.041 --> 55:57.200
Well, that explains a lot.

55:57.201 --> 56:01.520
What do you mean? I overheard Hasan talking to
someone on the phone the afternoon he got captured.

56:01.521 --> 56:03.840
That's where I heard the word
Hourglass.

56:03.841 --> 56:06.360
And you don't know what that means?

56:06.361 --> 56:08.561
Just what Simran said.

56:17.121 --> 56:18.921
Anything else you haven't told me?

56:19.921 --> 56:22.241
Just that I'm sorry
I ever suspected you.

56:50.641 --> 56:52.200
You wanted to see me?

56:52.201 --> 56:53.761
Yeah, Eddie made you this.

57:06.201 --> 57:07.241
It's so sweet. Yeah.

57:09.161 --> 57:12.681
I went to the hospital this
afternoon to give it to you.

57:15.401 --> 57:16.481
You weren't there.

57:19.001 --> 57:22.481
They said you checked yourself out,
right after we left.

57:25.401 --> 57:26.441
I did...

57:28.961 --> 57:30.881
I needed to go for a walk and think.

57:34.041 --> 57:35.161
About what?

57:50.521 --> 57:51.561
It's OK.

58:15.241 --> 58:17.200
I saw another name I recognised,

58:17.201 --> 58:19.641
Arthur Hill. The doctor
Faroux tortured in Tangier.

58:19.642 --> 58:22.640
I don't know anything about this.
You're a poor liar, doctor.

58:22.641 --> 58:24.199
I'm afraid I have
to ask you to leave.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.519
Are you threatening me, Bingham?

58:25.520 --> 58:27.001
And you're crying because
you want respect?

58:27.002 --> 58:28.560
I'm not looking
for your respect!

58:28.561 --> 58:29.721
We're being lied to.

58:30.961 --> 58:33.240
We've known that
since the day Sam returned.

58:33.241 --> 58:35.121
You watch yourself,
do you understand?

58:35.122 --> 58:36.801
Get in the car.

58:38.801 --> 58:39.961
Get down!
