01:29.980 --> 01:34.990
"Historia"

01:50.000 --> 01:52.169
Come on! The goal is right here!

01:52.170 --> 01:53.669
Keep it up!

01:53.670 --> 01:55.339
Nine hours and twelve minutes.

01:55.340 --> 01:58.590
Not a bad time, considering the weather.

01:59.970 --> 02:02.639
Thought we were gonna die out there.

02:02.640 --> 02:06.349
No one ever said winter training
would be this tough.

02:06.350 --> 02:08.689
Damn it, I can't feel my legs.

02:08.690 --> 02:11.519
I wish they'd let us inside already.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.479
I bet they're busy putting together
a huge feast for us! Yum...

02:15.480 --> 02:16.610
Hey!

02:17.700 --> 02:18.949
Christa is missing.

02:18.950 --> 02:19.989
Huh?

02:19.990 --> 02:24.159
She was sticking with Daz
since he wasn't doing so well.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.329
Daz isn't here either.

02:26.330 --> 02:28.039
Ymir as well.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.459
Maybe they're with the last squad?

02:30.460 --> 02:34.129
Can't be. The last squad,
led by Thomas, just arrived.

02:34.130 --> 02:35.919
They never saw those three.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.130
Huh?

02:40.380 --> 02:43.219
You don't think... they got lost?

02:43.220 --> 02:44.349
Hey...

02:44.350 --> 02:47.139
They don't stand a chance
if they're stuck in this blizzard.

02:47.140 --> 02:48.560
Shit!

02:49.560 --> 02:50.849
Eren!

02:50.850 --> 02:53.269
I'm going back out to try and find them!

02:53.270 --> 02:54.439
Me, too.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.609
Everyone, get in the cabin.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.649
But... Christa and...

02:57.650 --> 03:01.199
Yeah. We'll send a rescue team
first thing in the morning.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.029
It'll be too late by then!

03:03.030 --> 03:05.080
We won't make any more victims!

03:13.920 --> 03:15.380
Shit.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.060
Christa.

03:32.650 --> 03:35.310
Christa, give it up.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.279
Listen to me.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.690
Never.

03:41.780 --> 03:44.819
Daz already has one foot in the grave.

03:44.820 --> 03:47.489
It's his own fault for doing
this training to boost his score

03:47.490 --> 03:51.959
without knowing how much his body can take.

03:51.960 --> 03:55.879
He's just not cut out to be a soldier.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.509
If you keep crawling to the foot
of the mountain at this rate,

03:59.510 --> 04:04.129
he'll probably be a goner by then,
and we'd be lucky not to be.

04:04.130 --> 04:07.179
Which means there's only two outcomes.

04:07.180 --> 04:12.809
Leave Daz here and save ourselves,
or all three of us die.

04:12.810 --> 04:14.600
Which will it be?

04:15.900 --> 04:17.310
You forgot one.

04:17.940 --> 04:20.358
That your prediction is entirely wrong.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.820
I'll be able to reach our base
at the foot of the mountain... with Daz.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.699
You can go ahead of us and get back safe.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.830
How about that?

04:30.620 --> 04:32.999
There's no trouble in it for you.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.579
We'll make it back for sure.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.460
Go ahead of us.

04:53.350 --> 04:57.770
Hey. Why haven't you
asked me to help at all?

04:59.360 --> 05:00.939
I think...

05:00.940 --> 05:03.860
...you have no intention of saving Daz.

05:17.080 --> 05:21.710
You don't care. You've resigned
yourself to death already.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.130
You're hoping to die here, aren't you?

05:27.930 --> 05:28.930
How could you?

05:28.931 --> 05:30.820
I thought you were a good girl.

05:31.600 --> 05:35.600
You've gotta at least make it look like
you're trying to save his life.

05:36.140 --> 05:38.139
If you want people to remember you as a

05:38.140 --> 05:40.339
hero who died trying to save someone,

05:40.340 --> 05:42.520
don't drag him down with you.

05:43.030 --> 05:45.649
That's what a bad girl would do.

05:45.650 --> 05:46.990
You're wrong!

05:48.160 --> 05:49.869
I didn't...

05:49.870 --> 05:51.740
That's not...

05:56.080 --> 05:57.710
I...

06:00.330 --> 06:04.460
It's you, right? The mistress' daughter
who had people after your life.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.510
How do you know?

06:08.470 --> 06:10.049
I see...

06:10.050 --> 06:12.180
So it was you after all.

06:13.350 --> 06:15.290
It's something I happened to overhear.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.959
At a church in the interior,

06:19.960 --> 06:23.490
back when I snuck around
borrowing things to stay alive.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.149
What a sob story it was.

06:28.150 --> 06:30.950
An illegitimate child
can't succeed a powerful noble.

06:31.910 --> 06:36.550
So they just wanted to kill her,
to end all the fuss once and for all.

06:37.200 --> 06:41.830
But they'd look aside if she changed
her name and lived a humble life.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.300
In the end, I heard the girl was forced
to join the Cadet Corps.

06:49.550 --> 06:50.580
Don't you worry.

06:51.390 --> 06:55.180
I haven't told anyone.
I don't plan to either.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.030
Then...

06:57.810 --> 07:00.680
...did you enter the Cadet
Corps just to find me?

07:01.270 --> 07:04.060
If that's the case... why?

07:06.820 --> 07:09.420
Who knows. Maybe because we're similar.

07:09.860 --> 07:10.650
What?

07:11.660 --> 07:15.300
You and me... have similar backgrounds?

07:16.160 --> 07:18.410
Well, more or less.

07:19.660 --> 07:21.920
That's the reason you became a soldier?

07:22.460 --> 07:25.499
Could be. I don't really know.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.170
No, it's not.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.220
You wanted...

07:30.880 --> 07:32.610
...to become friends with me?

07:33.340 --> 07:36.060
Huh? You've got to be kidding me.

07:39.310 --> 07:41.560
You and I can't even compare.

07:42.140 --> 07:45.059
We both got a second chance at life.

07:45.060 --> 07:47.440
But I'm not the one who took
on a fake name.

07:48.070 --> 07:51.150
If I abandon my name
and reject who I am, they win.

07:51.780 --> 07:55.700
I'm going to keep the name I have
and make the best of my life.

07:56.160 --> 07:59.580
That's the one and only way
I can get my revenge.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.240
So how do you explain yourself?

08:02.870 --> 08:04.289
Are you gonna commit suicide

08:04.290 --> 08:07.090
and make everyone
who ruined your life happy?

08:07.670 --> 08:10.209
Why is your desire to kill
aimed at yourself?

08:10.210 --> 08:14.420
If you're so eager, use that passion
to change your own fate!

08:15.340 --> 08:17.929
I... I can't...

08:17.930 --> 08:18.880
Even now...

08:21.270 --> 08:24.680
There's no way the three of us
can make it out of here alive.

08:26.310 --> 08:27.190
There is.

08:27.191 --> 08:28.270
Huh?

08:36.909 --> 08:39.330
I can see the base straight down from here.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.620
We drop Daz off this cliff.

08:44.920 --> 08:45.920
What?

08:46.130 --> 08:48.199
Hopefully he survives the fall,

08:48.200 --> 08:50.520
and hopefully someone down there finds him.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.620
Sure, it might be a long shot, but...

08:55.130 --> 08:57.589
...that's his only real chance now.

08:57.590 --> 08:59.389
Unless some miracle happens,

08:59.390 --> 09:02.259
he'll be an icicle long
before you drag him down.

09:02.260 --> 09:03.350
But...

09:03.850 --> 09:05.770
But he'll die for sure if he falls!

09:07.060 --> 09:07.600
Shut up!

09:08.270 --> 09:09.190
Huh?

09:09.191 --> 09:10.569
Quit it!

09:10.570 --> 09:11.480
Ymir!

09:11.780 --> 09:14.610
I'll do it myself, so get moving already!

09:36.880 --> 09:38.430
It can't be...

09:39.300 --> 09:40.550
Wait!

09:41.720 --> 09:42.930
Ymir, wait!

09:48.900 --> 09:49.980
They're both...

09:53.190 --> 09:54.110
...gone.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.780
It's better if you guys don't come along.

10:00.240 --> 10:04.370
Like our instructor said, you'll only
end up becoming more victims.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.920
I'm going so that doesn't happen.

10:07.410 --> 10:09.170
I'm not leaving Christa and the others.

10:10.580 --> 10:12.910
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

10:13.800 --> 10:15.009
Don't try to stop...

10:15.010 --> 10:17.300
You're gonna need a lot
more gear than that.

10:18.970 --> 10:23.219
If you go by yourselves,
you'll be in the same pickle as Christa.

10:23.220 --> 10:25.600
In a search, the more eyes, the better.

10:26.350 --> 10:27.520
You guys...

10:28.600 --> 10:29.899
Thanks.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.609
To be honest, we could use you.

10:31.610 --> 10:32.650
Hey.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.330
We're coming too.

10:35.030 --> 10:37.569
The weather's steadily improving.

10:37.570 --> 10:38.779
I think we'll be fine.

10:38.780 --> 10:40.410
I brought extra rations!

10:40.700 --> 10:41.550
You guys...

10:47.910 --> 10:49.920
What was that sound just now?

10:59.170 --> 11:00.180
Somebody's coming!

11:17.570 --> 11:18.780
Ymir...

11:20.360 --> 11:23.500
Took you long enough.
I got here before you.

11:24.330 --> 11:28.550
I told Reiner and the others I'd wait
since you'd come along eventually.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.750
What a stupid thing I've done...

11:33.380 --> 11:34.250
Where's Daz?

11:47.470 --> 11:49.050
That was the cliff?

11:50.980 --> 11:52.970
But you didn't have any rope.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.440
Even if you did, it's too high.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.480
How did you get Daz down from there?

12:03.660 --> 12:04.640
Why not?

12:05.240 --> 12:07.450
I think I can trust you.

12:08.410 --> 12:09.200
However...

12:10.290 --> 12:11.270
Promise me.

12:12.250 --> 12:16.210
When I reveal my secret
to everyone, promise me.

12:17.630 --> 12:19.800
Take back your old name and live.

12:35.060 --> 12:36.230
Ymir!

12:38.480 --> 12:40.530
Christa... I felt the same.

12:41.190 --> 12:44.530
That it would have been better
if I was never born at all.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.530
I was hated by the world just for existing.

12:49.200 --> 12:49.970
I...

12:50.580 --> 12:54.370
To give countless people
joy, I gave up my life.

12:55.420 --> 12:59.240
But from that time,
there was a wish I held in my heart.

13:00.050 --> 13:03.170
If someday, I was given
a second chance at life...

13:03.680 --> 13:04.430
...this time...

13:05.340 --> 13:07.180
...I would live for no one but myself!

13:28.160 --> 13:29.240
Is this real?

13:30.240 --> 13:32.380
Ymir is a Titan, too?

13:32.950 --> 13:33.960
Ymir...

13:35.290 --> 13:38.170
Th-That Titan is...

13:44.840 --> 13:46.550
...from that day...

14:02.020 --> 14:04.310
Th-Thanks, Reiner.

14:05.190 --> 14:07.989
Ow, it hurts! Reiner, my leg!

14:07.990 --> 14:10.080
Reiner! That's enough!

14:10.410 --> 14:12.829
Let her leg go! Her leg!

14:12.830 --> 14:13.660
Hey!

14:16.370 --> 14:17.409
S-Sorry.

14:17.410 --> 14:19.140
No, you saved me.

14:19.670 --> 14:22.270
Christa... Did you know?

14:23.750 --> 14:26.780
That Ymir is a Titan?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.180
I had no idea.

14:31.220 --> 14:32.810
I was always so close to her, too.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.290
How? How could this be?

14:39.100 --> 14:41.330
That Titan... is Ymir?

14:44.150 --> 14:48.350
In other words, she knew
some of the secrets of our world.

14:48.990 --> 14:50.970
And I never suspected a thing.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.040
Hey... Do you think she's known about it?

14:56.950 --> 15:01.270
Eren's a Titan, too,
but he didn't know until it happened.

15:01.710 --> 15:05.820
But Ymir is like... she is aware
of being a Titan all along.

15:07.260 --> 15:10.129
Are you saying she might be
an enemy of humanity?

15:10.130 --> 15:13.100
I'm saying that's one
hell of a power to hide.

15:13.930 --> 15:16.680
Who knows what she might
have been thinking.

15:17.430 --> 15:20.540
I wonder... What could be Ymir's goal?

15:30.240 --> 15:31.360
Ymir!

15:56.760 --> 15:57.810
She's...

16:01.270 --> 16:02.729
Wh-What was that?

16:02.730 --> 16:05.710
Is she worried about the tower falling?

16:06.190 --> 16:07.270
She has to be.

16:07.860 --> 16:09.439
If she wanted to,

16:09.440 --> 16:12.750
Ymir could use this power
of hers to escape all on her own.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.850
And yet, she's not doing that.

16:17.870 --> 16:21.910
It's us... She's risking
her life to protect us.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.040
Why?

16:29.960 --> 16:30.920
Why?

16:31.590 --> 16:32.650
Ymir!

16:35.840 --> 16:37.350
Don't you die, Ymir!

16:37.680 --> 16:39.219
Not in a place like this!

16:39.220 --> 16:40.310
Hey!

16:40.390 --> 16:42.310
Don't pretend like you're good, you idiot!

16:44.600 --> 16:48.689
You wanna go out in a blaze of glory?
Are you stupid?!

16:48.690 --> 16:51.569
It's too late for you to try
and get into heaven!

16:51.570 --> 16:53.630
Live for yourself, goddammit!

16:54.740 --> 16:58.579
If you're gonna die protecting
this tower, forget about it!

16:58.580 --> 16:59.819
Tear it down!

16:59.820 --> 17:00.620
Hey!

17:14.589 --> 17:17.638
H-Hey! She's really tearing it down!

17:17.640 --> 17:18.849
Keep it up, Ymir!

17:23.270 --> 17:24.939
Want live...?

17:24.940 --> 17:26.270
Grab me!

18:03.470 --> 18:04.729
Titans again?

18:04.730 --> 18:07.810
Hey, ugly! Go and finish the job!

18:14.530 --> 18:15.480
Ymir!

18:23.290 --> 18:24.620
This looks bad.

18:39.510 --> 18:40.850
Ymir is...

18:43.140 --> 18:44.190
This can't...

18:45.430 --> 18:46.640
This can't...

18:48.940 --> 18:49.730
Christa!

18:50.770 --> 18:51.730
This can't...

18:52.110 --> 18:53.510
Ymir, wait!

18:55.280 --> 18:56.440
I still...

18:56.650 --> 18:58.490
...want to talk to you!

18:59.450 --> 19:00.280
I still...

19:00.860 --> 19:05.330
I still haven't told you my real name!

19:18.260 --> 19:19.250
Wait...

19:20.840 --> 19:21.610
I still...

19:32.650 --> 19:35.150
Christa. Everyone, get back.

19:36.110 --> 19:36.900
We've got this.

19:37.990 --> 19:39.400
Leave the rest to us.

19:39.990 --> 19:40.820
Mikasa!

19:49.290 --> 19:51.210
Have the others disperse
and cover the area!

19:51.620 --> 19:54.839
The rest of us will attack
where the Titans are gathering!

19:54.840 --> 19:55.670
Got it!

19:56.500 --> 19:57.210
Hey!

19:57.211 --> 19:59.730
We don't need you to be
a part of the attack!

20:02.180 --> 20:03.230
Die!

20:05.050 --> 20:07.180
I did it! My first kill!

20:12.310 --> 20:15.519
You moron! I told you to stay back, Eren!

20:15.520 --> 20:17.050
Right! I'm sorry!

20:17.570 --> 20:18.939
Ouch...

20:18.940 --> 20:19.820
Hey!

20:20.780 --> 20:21.720
Eren!

20:22.610 --> 20:23.750
You guys!

21:13.370 --> 21:14.500
It can't be...

21:15.370 --> 21:17.000
Ymir is...

21:22.590 --> 21:23.660
Ymir...

21:38.150 --> 21:39.680
My real name...

21:41.190 --> 21:43.490
...is Historia.

23:41.190 --> 23:44.450
There was no damage seen along Wall Rose.

23:45.320 --> 23:49.470
Then how is it that Titans appeared
on the inside of the wall?

23:50.650 --> 23:52.159
Thrown into confusion,

23:52.160 --> 23:54.089
the Scouts decide to return to

23:54.090 --> 23:56.830
Trost with doubts weighing
heavily on their mind.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.559
However...

23:59.560 --> 24:04.300
...Eren learns a shocking secret...
one that changes everything.
