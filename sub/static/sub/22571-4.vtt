WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:02.403
- This facility is great.

00:02.503 --> 00:04.505
This is my secret spot,
my honey hole.

00:04.605 --> 00:05.939
And sometimes, I score so big,

00:06.040 --> 00:07.808
I don't even gotta work
the rest of the year.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.377
That's how sweet this hole is.

00:09.477 --> 00:12.513
I mean, sweet, sweet honey hole.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.183
- Yeah, in the desert and sand.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.918
- Ivy's backyard.
They say it's his honey hole,

00:18.018 --> 00:20.421
and I bet it gets sticky
in the sand.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.390
Okay.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.661
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:27.761 --> 00:30.030
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:30.131 --> 00:31.532
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:31.632 --> 00:33.534
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:33.634 --> 00:34.868
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.204
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:36.304 --> 00:37.905
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:38.005 --> 00:39.440
- You shut your face.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.609
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.776
- We're back, baby!

00:46.347 --> 00:47.748
- I got up really early today

00:47.848 --> 00:49.717
to drive all the way
our to Lancaster,

00:49.817 --> 00:52.019
'cause the units in San Diego
have been really, really,

00:52.120 --> 00:53.487
really crappy.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.356
But I'll tell you one thing,
if a unit looks good,

00:55.456 --> 00:57.691
I have to buy it,
'cause we need merchandise.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.560
So today, I'm not gonna
deal with anybody's BS.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.629
I'm just gonna go there
and buy the best unit.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.297
End of story.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.300
- I've been kinda laying low
for the last couple of months,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.136
just kinda reflecting on life,
you know,

01:08.236 --> 01:10.438
and just trying to
get my Zen going.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.973
And, you know, I'm just not
the same old Dave I used to be.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.642
Mr. A-hole is what
they used to call me,

01:14.742 --> 01:16.777
and I haven't been
hearing that a lot lately,

01:16.877 --> 01:17.978
and I kinda miss it,

01:18.078 --> 01:19.447
so I think I'm gonna
go back to it.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.315
Being Zen was never my thing.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.916
I'm an A-hole
through and through.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.990
- Well, my first goal today
is not to get heatstroke.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.024
- Stay hydrated, my friend.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.593
- I'm fat.
I'm at high risk here.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.295
How are you
with your CPR skills?

01:34.395 --> 01:35.929
- Depends.
If there's green

01:36.029 --> 01:37.398
coming out of your mouth, you
might just lay there with it.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.200
?
- Yeah.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.501
*

01:40.601 --> 01:42.403
- I'm gonna go say hi to Laura.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.041
- I was wondering what you're
doing with that popsicle.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.178
You need something to...

01:50.278 --> 01:51.779
put your lips on?

01:53.281 --> 01:54.715
- Justin. Nice to meet ya.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.584
- Hi.
Oh, I love your smile.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.152
Laura Dotson.
How are you?

01:59.487 --> 02:00.654
- I'm here to help
you guys make money.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.356
- Good looking guy, sharp, tall.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.924
You're gonna be head
and shoulders over the rest.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.959
- Hey, man,
school start at 7:00...

02:06.059 --> 02:07.761
- Down here.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.096
- Summer break.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.264
- You have a lot of stuff
in your mouth today.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.832
Oh, you on summer break?
- Yeah.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.934
- Go to summer school.
- Too smart for that.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.536
- Too smart...
- But today you'll be in school,

02:15.636 --> 02:16.770
when I show you
how to buy some units.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.372
- Don't you need
some extra credit?

02:18.472 --> 02:20.341
- I'ma show you extra credit.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.875
You're a lot of talk, huh, Ivy?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.477
- I like that young people--
they always got big balls.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.912
They always wanna talk ,
until you shut 'em down--

02:25.012 --> 02:26.714
- Who invited the Kool-Aid Man
over here?

02:27.881 --> 02:30.117
How are old are you?
- I'm 22.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.419
- Yeah, I'm, like,
triple his age.

02:31.519 --> 02:32.586
I had a lot of fun
when I was in college.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.523
You could be--
we could be related.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.058
- What do you think
is important at auction?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.427
- To make money.
- Well, that's the goal,

02:39.527 --> 02:41.662
but what's important at auction?
- To buy units.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.897
- No, important is not
to have a big mouth.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.500
Important part is, bring cash.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.768
Let me see.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.603
- Oh, I got it.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.672
I got it.
I don't need to show you.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.475
You'll see when I buy the units.
- That's okay, young buck.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.810
I hate it when experienced
millennials talk crap

02:56.910 --> 02:58.111
and can't back it up.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.248
Why don't you go buy
some avocado toast?

03:00.348 --> 03:01.815
If I find a unit
with a wheelchair in there,

03:01.915 --> 03:03.183
I'll make sure I purchase it
just for you, okay?

03:03.284 --> 03:04.985
- Okay.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.320
- Yeah.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.855
- You better put me
in a wheelchair, son.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.624
- Welcome to Purely Storage
in Lancaster, California.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.625
Before you go through
these gates,

03:11.725 --> 03:13.126
you need to know the rules.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.695
We're gonna go to the unit,
we're gonna remove the lock,

03:14.795 --> 03:16.129
we're gonna give you five
minutes to take a look around.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.198
And you can't go inside,
you can't open any boxes...

03:18.299 --> 03:19.967
--
- Oh!

03:20.067 --> 03:21.335
push me.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.503
- Why don't you give him
some space there, Rene?

03:22.603 --> 03:23.804
- But don't push me
like that, okay?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.306
- And I thought
I was the A-hole.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.774
- It's hot, tempers are flaring.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.276
- Where do you get
these guys from?

03:28.376 --> 03:29.377
- I'm just testing him.
I wanted to see if I end up

03:29.477 --> 03:30.878
in a wheelchair.
I'm sorry.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.380
- Instead of a wheelchair, you
might end up in an ambulance.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.381
- All right,
let's do an auction.

03:34.815 --> 03:35.716
- All right,
you can't go inside,

03:35.816 --> 03:37.351
you can't open any boxes,

03:37.451 --> 03:38.886
and whosever got most money in
their pocket can own it today.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.321
Are you ready?

03:40.421 --> 03:41.655
Right on then!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

03:41.755 --> 03:44.525
- All right, folks, this way.
Follow the lady.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.059
Don't let him get
your tempers flaring.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.529
You know, he's just trying
to see what you're made of,

03:48.629 --> 03:50.298
and he's trying to see
if you got money in your wallet.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.932
- He's gonna learn today.
- Oh, yeah.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.569
All right, come on!
Let's do it to it.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.104
Here we go!

03:57.204 --> 03:58.639
- Oh, I never
get tired of tires.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.308
- All right!

04:00.408 --> 04:01.542
*

04:01.642 --> 04:03.411
- Damn, Gina!

04:03.511 --> 04:05.346
We got tires, we got a barbecue.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.014
I don't know.
The one thing about this,

04:07.114 --> 04:09.583
it'll fit in the back
of my truck.

04:09.683 --> 04:10.918
And if I don't like it,

04:11.018 --> 04:12.686
I could always toss it off
in front of Ivy's place.

04:12.786 --> 04:16.056
- That's a good--
37-inch TV most likely up there.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.225
Nice barbecue propane tank.

04:18.326 --> 04:21.629
Hey, this room, small but great.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.497
- Couple of nightstands
that are beat to crap.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.299
I mean, the only thing
you're really bidding on

04:25.399 --> 04:27.034
is those little
Priority Mail boxes,

04:27.134 --> 04:29.069
but it's probably just gonna be
dishes and household stuff,

04:29.169 --> 04:32.506
so... there's a little mystery,
but not really.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.508
- I see a nice little
electric scooter back there.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.176
Got a TV in there.
If it's in the box,

04:36.276 --> 04:38.211
you know, that will help out,
and, you know--

04:38.312 --> 04:39.980
All in all, I mean,
it's not too bad of a unit.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.183
You can make a few dollars
if it goes for the right price.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.085
- Smoking hot unit!
- Whoo! Let's do it.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.020
25 right there.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.856
35, 50...
- Yeah!

04:48.956 --> 04:50.558
- 50 bucks, 60 bucks, 70...
- Yeah.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.159
- 80, 90...
- Right here!

04:52.259 --> 04:54.061
- In back, way back.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.563
- 120...
- Here!

04:55.663 --> 04:57.297
- Ivy, Ivy.
- 140, 150, now 200.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.132
- Yep!
- Yeah!

04:59.232 --> 05:00.233
- Yep!
- Right here!

05:00.334 --> 05:02.069
- You ain't got
no chance, local.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.871
- Yeah!
- Yep!

05:03.971 --> 05:05.038
I'm taking this .

05:05.138 --> 05:06.774
- 320, now 330...
- Yep!

05:06.874 --> 05:08.409
- 340, 350, 360, 370, 380...
- Yep!

05:08.509 --> 05:09.910
- Whoo!

05:10.010 --> 05:12.079
- 420!
- Now 430.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.414
I got 420 for Dave.
430 going once...

05:13.514 --> 05:14.882
- I'll let him have it.
- 430 going twice.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.183
430 bucks--

05:16.283 --> 05:18.318
Sold it your way, Dave.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.920
You got it for 420.
- Whoo!

05:20.020 --> 05:21.489
- It's a tiny little locker.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.256
I might as well
go through it right now.

05:23.357 --> 05:27.194
Let's see,
we got some kinda KMC rims.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.363
Let's see if we got
a TV in here.

05:29.463 --> 05:33.000
Uh, doesn't feel like a TV.
Either that, or I'm real strong.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.602
One empty box.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.069
Little camping barbecue.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.506
It's really looking
kind of like a letdown,

05:38.606 --> 05:39.840
but we'll see.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.509
Christmas tree stand.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.544
*

05:43.644 --> 05:47.648
We've got kids clothes and junk.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.618
Razor.
That's trash.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.252
We got a barbecue.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.754
*

05:53.854 --> 05:55.155
Maybe I'll get lucky,

05:55.255 --> 06:02.362
and they put their good stuff
in the drawers.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.666
Damn it.
That's a pile of trash.

06:05.766 --> 06:09.737
*

06:09.837 --> 06:11.439
Pile of trash.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.407
That's all she wrote.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.410
The only thing I might keep
is the three rims and stove,

06:16.510 --> 06:19.680
but honestly, I think
even that's probably trash.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.148
There's just really
no value here.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.817
I think--I think
I drove all the way down here

06:23.917 --> 06:25.118
and lost a couple hundred bucks,

06:25.218 --> 06:27.254
and better get back
to the auction.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.357
- Come on, outdoor unit!

06:30.458 --> 06:32.526
Whoo! Oh, yeah.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.227
*

06:34.327 --> 06:36.229
- A little mystery case
in the back.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.998
Oh, it's a piano back there.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.867
If I'm the only one
that sees this piano,

06:39.967 --> 06:41.435
I can get this locker cheap.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.736
- Wow, there ain't much here.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.605
There's a dolly,
some kinda plastic cabinets.

06:44.705 --> 06:45.806
Pass.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.775
- Those are really cool boxes
by the way.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.710
Probably had to pay
100 bucks each for those boxes.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.045
This is my kinda unit,
but, you know what,

06:52.145 --> 06:53.781
I'm looking for
the grandma unit today,

06:53.881 --> 06:56.484
that unit that just is that big

06:56.584 --> 06:58.085
and jumps in my truck.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.487
- Hey, you guys,
move out the way,

06:59.587 --> 07:01.421
guru baby coming through.
- I swear to God, like,

07:01.522 --> 07:03.090
the kids in my elementary school
my daughter--

07:03.190 --> 07:04.592
say the same type of .

07:04.692 --> 07:06.193
I think like I'm talking
to my kid right now.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.495
It's amazing.
And I'm at work.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.996
- You mean,
all your daughter's friends

07:09.096 --> 07:10.531
disrespect you like that?
- Yeah, exactly...

07:10.631 --> 07:12.332
- What a sad existence.
- That's exactly how it is.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.034
We'll just see what happens
if a good unit comes up.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.469
This is crap.
This is for the rookie.

07:15.569 --> 07:16.937
- Oh, you're just saying that
'cause you're mad.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.972
- The only chance he has is
to buy a garbage can like this

07:19.072 --> 07:20.541
and be like,
"Look, I outbid you."

07:20.641 --> 07:22.109
- All right, and if you're ready
to go, I'm ready to go,

07:22.209 --> 07:24.311
and here we go.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.113
- 10 bucks!

07:26.213 --> 07:28.516
20, now 30.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.183
- 30.
- 40, now 50...

07:30.283 --> 07:31.384
- There you go.
- 40 bucks, 50 bucks.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.553
Going once.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.121
50 going twice.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.823
50

07:35.923 --> 07:39.059
Sold it your way.
40 bucks just in time.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.428
What is that?

07:41.529 --> 07:44.331
Yes! Going to the dump again.
Going to the dump!

07:44.431 --> 07:46.099
- I guess Rene
didn't see the piano.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.367
Too bad for him.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.938
- All right,
come on and work it out.

07:51.038 --> 07:54.341
Here we go!
Whoa, big unit, folks.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.043
*

07:56.143 --> 07:59.046
- Okay, we got
a foosball table. Yay.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.181
The motorcycle is the best thing
out of the whole deal.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.083
All right, what are those
in the back corner

08:03.183 --> 08:05.018
- There are guns.
According to California FFL,

08:05.118 --> 08:07.054
you better do the right thing
and do a private party--

08:07.154 --> 08:08.388
- Too much for me to deal with.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.257
- Selling guns in California
can be tricky.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.725
It's gotta be done in person,

08:11.825 --> 08:13.527
through a licensed
federal firearms dealer.

08:13.627 --> 08:14.795
- It's an okay unit.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.063
It looks a lot better
than you think.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.565
But the guns are trouble,
so I don't know.

08:17.665 --> 08:18.799
If it goes cheap,
I might buy it,

08:18.899 --> 08:20.300
but it's really not my thing.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.836
*

08:22.936 --> 08:25.773
- Got some tools,
foosball table.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.074
Not much for me.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.809
- Motorcycle,
Chinese brand right here.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.377
A little Chinese pit bike.
They're kinda cool.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.245
Ooh, I like that little
guitar thingy there.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.815
Hey, I'm close to home.

08:34.915 --> 08:37.084
Can't hurt me too bad.
I'll bid anyway.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.686
- All right, if you're ready
to go, I'm ready to go.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.087
Got a big old nice
man cave unit.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.624
- 100.
- Right there. 200.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.292
- And I got 200, 300.
300 where?

08:45.392 --> 08:46.694
400 where?
And 400.

08:46.794 --> 08:47.995
- Tell him, folks.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.730
- 500, 500, 600, 700.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.632
And I got 600, 700, 700.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.200
Are you 800?
- Yes!

08:53.300 --> 08:54.702
- 900, 900, 900, 900 there.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.937
1000
- Tell him, folks.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.939
1,100 now.
- Right here.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.641
- 1,200, 1,200...
- Come on, Ivy, get in there.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.910
- Whoo!

09:03.010 --> 09:04.244
1,400, 1,350...
- That's right.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.313
- 1,350, you're out.
I got 1,350, 1,400.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.148
I got 1,350 going once.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.150
1,400 going twice.
1,400 bucks--

09:12.319 --> 09:13.887
- Whoo!
- Sold it your way, Ivy.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.224
$1,350!
- Palmdale-bound, baby.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.692
- Ivy,
take those sunglasses off.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.260
You might see better.
- Thank you, folks.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.729
That's right.
That's the end of the sale.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.631
Don't forget to pay the lady.
God bless everyone.

09:23.731 --> 09:24.965
- Talked all that trash
in the beginning,

09:25.065 --> 09:26.566
but you came here
and bought nothing.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.368
You know what,
I buy when there's good stuff.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.170
But I hope you realize
this isn't over,

09:30.270 --> 09:32.205
and it's gonna get
very expensive for you.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.340
*

09:35.442 --> 09:36.810
*

09:36.910 --> 09:39.012
- I bought this locker
for $1,350,

09:39.112 --> 09:40.948
so I got an uphill climb
ahead of me.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.650
Nothing left but to do it.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.918
Gun cleaner, 5 bucks.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.054
Air compressor, 5 bucks.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.022
Water pump, 10 bucks.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.191
Oh, yeah.
Ain't nothing like a guitar amp.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.660
25 bucks right there.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.361
This is Chinese pit bike
all the way.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.363
I'll get about 400 bucks.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.465
Oh, looks like we got a router.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.233
Router.
Feels like it's in there too.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.136
Come on, router!
Whoo! There it is.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.505
It's not a router,
but it's a skill saw.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.040
$45 right there.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.076
Makita, awesome brand,
awesome condition.

10:09.176 --> 10:12.145
Foosball table,
good condition, $75.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.181
Firm. Whoo-hoo!

10:14.281 --> 10:16.349
Well, it's a Fender,
but it's a cheap one.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.218
With the case, 200 bucks.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.920
Ooh, nice tools.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.656
All Craftsman,
plus the case itself, $300.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.925
Right here, punching bag.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.960
Whoo! Still got it.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.528
Knocked your ass out.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.699
Wavemaster, 80 bucks.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.033
What we got here?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.068
*

10:35.168 --> 10:36.436
By the look of this cord

10:36.536 --> 10:38.238
and that key, this is old.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.573
I bet this thing
is 1950s, 1960s.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.509
I'd be lying if I act like
I knew what these were.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.845
Ace of clubs, ace of hearts.
Any--ooh, wait a minute.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.515
Oh, sweet.
Oh, there we go.

10:48.615 --> 10:49.983
Needs a little WD-40.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.019
This right here has gotta be
at least as old as that.

10:52.119 --> 10:55.422
You know what, I'm gonna put
all three of these together,

10:55.522 --> 10:57.190
and I'ma take these somewhere

10:57.290 --> 10:59.459
and find out if I'm rich
or just well off,

10:59.559 --> 11:00.928
'cause I already know
they're worth money.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.130
My honey hole strikes again.

11:03.230 --> 11:07.034
Whoa!

11:07.134 --> 11:08.135
- My honey hole strikes again.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.503
Whoa!
Now I know I just hit it.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.005
This is my money back.

11:15.108 --> 11:18.111
Rock-Ola,
made in Chicago, Illinois.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.546
Oh, wait a minute...

11:19.646 --> 11:22.282
Heck yeah, look at
that old machinery in there.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.917
This is jackpot, baby.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.920
I don't know how much jackpot,
but I guarantee it's jackpot.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.555
Got a pool right here.

11:28.655 --> 11:31.624
That's what all this filters
and PVC and everything goes to.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.226
I'll put that at 200 bucks.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.528
Right here, we got one of
those little blowup tent things,

11:35.628 --> 11:37.197
one of them little kid castles.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.933
I put that at 100 bucks.
$100 weed whacker.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.335
Well, right here,
we got the guns that we saw.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.137
This is a small one to me.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.572
Thing about these are,
when you find 'em,

11:45.672 --> 11:47.107
you gotta find the FFL dealer,

11:47.207 --> 11:48.909
take 'em in,
and see if they're legit.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.477
If they're legit,
you get to keep 'em.

11:50.577 --> 11:53.847
If they're not, you don't.
.22, I've seen 1,000 of these.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.582
They're actually worth
about 150 bucks.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.484
This one feels like another .22.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.320
Same model, Ruger, .22.
150 bucks.

12:00.420 --> 12:04.157
And this one, 12 gauge pump
Remington 700.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.458
Worth about 250.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.828
Oh, yeah!

12:07.928 --> 12:09.029
Whoo!

12:09.129 --> 12:10.730
Out of everything
I got in this unit,

12:10.831 --> 12:11.999
I love this the most,

12:12.099 --> 12:13.466
'cause you find
something like this--

12:13.566 --> 12:17.137
ooh! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

12:17.237 --> 12:19.372
Thor is here!

12:23.443 --> 12:25.178
- Already know I'm gonna
make my money back.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.947
Let's see what kinda
profit we got.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.916
40 bucks for this unit
was a steal.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.517
This is gonna be easy.

12:30.617 --> 12:34.687
So, starting off right here,
just in this dolly alone,

12:34.788 --> 12:35.989
I can easily sell this
for 50 bucks,

12:36.089 --> 12:37.524
make my profit back
just on those alone.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.526
And then right here, we have
these two cases here.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.628
*

12:41.728 --> 12:42.930
Empty.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.664
I could easily sell
this case for $30.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.034
And there's two of 'em.
60 bucks just right there.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.201
Side table here.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.736
Looks to be in
really good shape.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.605
Clean it up, easily get
$20 on this piece right here.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.407
And what I'm very
interested to see

12:54.507 --> 12:56.643
is what's in this case
back here.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.478
Ah, feels empty.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.080
Take it out here.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.282
Moment of truth.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.783
No, just some foam.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.285
Well, still the case alone,
you know,

13:05.385 --> 13:07.554
I could at least get
another 50 bucks off this case.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.222
Got some stands here.
Selling some wood.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.924
Easy $20 bill.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.726
Cleaning up this coffee table.
Easy $30 on this right here.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.295
All right.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.830
*

13:16.930 --> 13:18.331
I am loving this.

13:18.431 --> 13:22.002
Money, money, money, all day.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.336
They already have
the price tag on 'em.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.438
So we got a $20 price tag
and a $23 price tag.

13:25.538 --> 13:26.974
If we were to play it safe,

13:27.074 --> 13:28.608
$15 a piece
on each one of those.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.010
You know,
we got an easy 130 bucks

13:30.110 --> 13:31.344
on these rocks by themselves.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.947
A McDonald's toy.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.683
Looks like we have
all the other parts in here too.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.618
You know,
it's in good condition.

13:38.718 --> 13:41.254
Just wipe it down,
have all the pieces in here,

13:41.354 --> 13:42.489
and if I'm gonna sell it,

13:42.589 --> 13:43.756
I have to at least get
100 bucks for it.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.492
Let's see, we got a piano here.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.726
German Scale.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.729
Sounds good.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.031
It's a clean piano.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.565
It has a seat back here
to go with it.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.001
You know, something like this,

13:54.101 --> 13:56.203
I wouldn't let go for
anything less than $1,000.

13:56.303 --> 13:59.106
Rene came here talking trash
and throwing elbows,

13:59.206 --> 14:01.008
but he isn't making money
like I am.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.375
All right.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.144
*

14:04.244 --> 14:06.213
Eh.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.347
What is this?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.216
Looks like
some type of power tool.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.884
A Luck Bone Saw.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.386
This goes into bones?
That's just crazy.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.722
Just picturing right now--just--
Pretty weird.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.024
We're gonna have to definitely
get this checked out,

14:17.124 --> 14:19.559
'cause I have no clue

14:19.659 --> 14:21.061
what something
like this goes for.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.765
- Good morning to
Grandma's Attic.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.468
- Hey, Tom!
I invited Tom Baker to my store

14:28.568 --> 14:30.737
to take a look at my old school
gambling equipment.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.572
- Oh, my goodness gracious, sir,
how you doing?

14:32.672 --> 14:34.374
I'm your slot machine guy.
What you got?

14:34.474 --> 14:35.875
- You know my store's
a metamorphic layer

14:35.976 --> 14:38.045
of true romanticism.
- I look at this place,

14:38.145 --> 14:41.281
it's a metamorphic layer
of true romanticism.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.816
Told ya.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.252
You ready?
- I sure am.

14:45.352 --> 14:46.987
- You don't look ready.
Get your ready look on.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.056
- Show me your ready look.

14:49.156 --> 14:50.657
- Ready.
All right, what you got, sir?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.161
Oh, you ready?
- Yeah.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.229
- This--yes, you did.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.298
This is a nice antique
roulette wheel.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.100
I can tell the wear and tear
from the numbers.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.335
It's missing a couple
of the agitation diamonds

15:02.435 --> 15:05.205
that would trigger the ball
to go and skip and do its thing.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.473
And there are no pockets.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.675
I think they took the cage out,

15:08.775 --> 15:11.244
because I can see those
small dadoed slots in here,

15:11.344 --> 15:13.280
so that's missing.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.814
- Older than the 1950s.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.349
- So, the way it sits now,

15:16.449 --> 15:18.952
it's not perfect,
but it's kinda working.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.121
How much is it worth?
- $75.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.455
- Eh, it's not bad.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.557
- I can tell you,
I recognize this one right away.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.527
It's technical name would be
Electro Blackjack.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.862
- It did.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.431
What happens--
a coin mech like this

15:31.531 --> 15:34.334
was wired into
15, 20 feet of wiring.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.703
It would transmit the signal
10, 15 feet away.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.105
And you'd press this.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.607
It would then send that signal
up to the monitor,

15:40.707 --> 15:42.609
which had a very crude
receiver in this.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.277
The receiver
would receive the signal.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.214
It would say, "Okay, stand,
hit, hold, draw, whatever,"

15:47.314 --> 15:49.716
so the person could play
Blackjack against someone else

15:49.816 --> 15:51.551
or play Blackjack
against the computer.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.420
Probably more video gaming,
less gambling,

15:53.520 --> 15:55.788
because the disclaimer
that said, "For amusement only."

15:55.888 --> 15:57.490
- Correct.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.793
- So what can I get
for this, this, and this?

16:00.893 --> 16:02.762
- In the great condition
these are in...

16:02.862 --> 16:10.603
*

16:10.703 --> 16:12.105
About 500.
- That's great.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.440
That's about 300 bucks more
than I thought it was worth.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.242
- Absolutely.
- Onto my next piece...

16:15.342 --> 16:17.377
- Now this is my territory.
- Uh!

16:17.477 --> 16:18.711
- This is beautiful.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.912
- Now you look ready.
- Now I look ready.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.581
Let me tell you
a story about this thing.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.950
This is a genuine Rock-Ola.
It's 1930s.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.485
It was the golden age
of slot machines.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.254
- This is on the upper end
of slot machines?

16:27.354 --> 16:28.721
- Oh, yeah, and it's U.S. made.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.324
This is a beauty.
I would love to open this up.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.126
- Eh, I trust Tom.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.594
Looks like he's been
inside a few slots.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.996
- There we go.
Okay, excellent.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.531
This is my bread and butter.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.233
The discs are intact.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.601
I don't see any damage
to the reels.

16:41.701 --> 16:42.735
We're going to trigger this,

16:42.835 --> 16:45.205
listen for reels one,
two, and three,

16:45.305 --> 16:47.540
and then I'm gonna listen
for the payout slides to reset.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.809
That'll tell me if this machine
is still pretty good.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.847
*

16:54.947 --> 16:55.848
Beautiful.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.317
There's five clicks.
Beautiful.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.352
I just discovered something
on your machine too

16:59.452 --> 17:00.920
that you're going to find
very intriguing.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.422
It cheated the customer.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.457
Notice right here,
that's a slug.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.360
It allowed the proprietor
to cheat the customer

17:07.460 --> 17:09.896
by never letting that pin

17:09.996 --> 17:12.665
right here go into it

17:12.765 --> 17:14.434
to win that combination.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.469
Little did you know
that as a player,

17:16.569 --> 17:17.670
you were playing
an unfair machine.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.339
- Well, it looks
pretty easy to remove.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.241
Should I remove it or just--
- No.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.842
- Leave it alone.

17:22.942 --> 17:26.146
It's provenance, it's history,
it's remarkable.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.215
- So tell me,
what's my jackpot looking like?

17:28.315 --> 17:30.317
- Being an 87-year-old machine,

17:30.417 --> 17:31.984
it plays well.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.923
*

17:37.023 --> 17:39.459
No less than 2,200.
- Whoo!

17:39.559 --> 17:41.528
You know I'm going straight
to the cashier with that.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.896
I hit the jackpot.
- Absolutely.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.333
- Till the next slot machine
or I see you again.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.201
See you later.
- Be careful, sir.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.239
- I'm at the Southern
California Medical Museum

17:52.339 --> 17:53.840
to see Dr. Hans Davidson.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.175
Dr. Davidson?
- That's me.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.609
- Justin.
- You're Justin.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.212
And that's the item
that I heard so much about?

17:59.312 --> 18:00.813
- Yeah, it's my bone saw.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.715
- Follow me.
- I know I'm in the right place,

18:02.815 --> 18:05.452
because everything in here
is as creepy as my bone saw.

18:05.552 --> 18:11.124
*

18:11.224 --> 18:13.960
- This is cool, man.
This is unusual.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.562
You don't see those very often,

18:15.662 --> 18:17.664
although a lot of them
were made.

18:17.764 --> 18:21.634
This is a Luck,
L-U-C-K, Bone Saw.

18:21.734 --> 18:25.638
And Dr. Luck was a very famous
orthopedic surgeon.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.708
And this Luck Saw
is the first saw

18:28.808 --> 18:30.943
that actually
could be sterilized...

18:31.043 --> 18:32.044
- Wow.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.480
- And so that made
a huge difference.

18:33.580 --> 18:37.550
See, in the olden times,
like this is from the Civil War,

18:37.650 --> 18:38.985
they did it by hand,

18:39.085 --> 18:41.154
and, of course,
this couldn't be sterilized.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.456
Dr. Luck was a soldier also,

18:43.556 --> 18:47.594
and he used his own implement
during the Second World War.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.730
Now, as a surgeon, you need to
have both hands available,

18:50.830 --> 18:52.665
and so this had a foot pedal,

18:52.765 --> 18:55.435
so you would operate it
with your foot

18:55.535 --> 18:57.103
and have both hands ready.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.806
And so what you would do
is cut something off,

18:59.906 --> 19:01.674
like an amputation,
would cut off your arm...

19:01.774 --> 19:03.176
- Don't look at my arm.
My arm is staying on my body.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.544
- No one's cutting me apart.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.213
- I can try.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.348
- All right, Doc,
give me the diagnosis.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.482
How much is this worth?

19:09.582 --> 19:11.784
- Well, this is a wonderful,

19:11.884 --> 19:15.154
fairly important instrument.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.690
As it is, I would ask...

19:17.790 --> 19:19.426
*

19:19.526 --> 19:21.194
$300.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.629
- Hey, it's not bad.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.963
300 bucks, just extra money
in my pocket, so...

19:24.063 --> 19:25.565
- Yeah.
Congratulations.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.500
You found something real good.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.068
Why don't you come with me,
and I'll show you

19:29.168 --> 19:31.904
some other interesting
and somewhat freaky things...

19:32.004 --> 19:33.806
- Hey, sounds good to me.
- In the museum.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.079
- Oh, you just
want me to touch it?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.281
- Yeah, touch it.
- All right.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.449
- Come on.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.054
Ooh!

19:48.154 --> 19:50.223
- And so this is
for that purpose.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.759
And then also,
I have been using this

19:52.859 --> 19:54.761
to regrow my hair.
As you can see...

19:54.861 --> 19:55.995
- Oh, it's working.
I can tell.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.330
- It's working already.
- I like it.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.100
*

20:01.200 --> 20:04.036
narrator: Ivy Calvin hit
the jackpot on his honey hole,

20:04.136 --> 20:06.673
earning $3,500.

20:06.773 --> 20:10.310
Justin Bryant cut off a profit
of 1,700 bones,

20:10.410 --> 20:13.079
and it didn't cost him
an arm and a leg.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.615
Rene Nezhoda tried
to push and shove his way

20:19.185 --> 20:22.355
And Dave Hester got back
to being an A-hole,d.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.924
but ended up in the hole.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.960
- I knew I'd find the perfect
place to dump this stuff.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.162
"No dumping of any kind"?

20:30.263 --> 20:31.698
That doesn't apply to me.

20:31.798 --> 20:32.965
*

20:33.065 --> 20:34.967
I'm always trying
to help my friends out.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.937
*

20:40.172 --> 20:42.409
Oh, hell, here he comes.
Let me get out of here.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.411
- Hey!
- Hey, Ivy!

20:44.511 --> 20:45.912
No charge!

20:46.012 --> 20:48.147
Yep!
- Come back here! Hey!

20:48.247 --> 20:51.050
*

20:51.150 --> 20:52.485
Mother.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.086
Ah, I hate that man!

20:54.186 --> 20:55.755
*

20:55.855 --> 20:56.989
Hey...

20:57.089 --> 20:58.358
*

20:58.458 --> 21:00.192
These are pretty cool.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.461
Thanks, Dave!
