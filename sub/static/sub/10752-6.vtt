00:31.740 --> 00:34.419
And every other day, I
take a short helicopter ride

00:34.420 --> 00:36.299
to Heston Blumenthal's restaurant.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.019
Last night,

00:38.020 --> 00:41.139
I ate a chocolate radio that
still worked in my stomach,

00:41.140 --> 00:44.459
and a flat chicken that was
actually a glass of water.

00:44.460 --> 00:46.059
Even the menu was edible.

00:46.060 --> 00:48.259
They said it wasn't, but I ate it.

00:48.260 --> 00:50.979
Sounds like you're
living the life of Riley.

00:50.980 --> 00:54.979
Well, I actually knew Riley,
and yes, there are similarities.

00:55.220 --> 00:59.219
And yet, there is some sadness in
your life. Tell me about Victoria.

01:00.100 --> 01:03.379
You'll have to forgive me,
there's been quite a few Victorias.

01:03.380 --> 01:04.659
Your wife?

01:04.660 --> 01:08.139
My God, my wife, oh yes, Victoria!

01:08.140 --> 01:12.139
What a fantastic woman. The two weeks
we were married were unforgettable.

01:13.300 --> 01:17.299
She disappeared in mysterious
circumstances, did she not?

01:17.620 --> 01:20.459
She vanished while washing the car.

01:20.460 --> 01:24.179
Despite a search that lasted
nearly five hours, we found nothing.

01:24.180 --> 01:28.139
So naturally, we assumed
the worst. You must miss her.

01:28.140 --> 01:32.139
More than words could say.

01:32.980 --> 01:36.979
I'd give anything to see her
walk through that door right now.

01:41.660 --> 01:44.619
Hey, why don't you
take your clothes off?

01:44.620 --> 01:46.099
What?

01:46.100 --> 01:50.099
Come on, we both knew it was on the cards
as soon as I realised you were a woman!

01:50.860 --> 01:52.779
What if someone were to walk in?

01:52.780 --> 01:56.019
I left strict instructions not to
be disturbed in case we had sex.

01:56.020 --> 01:59.019
There's no way anyone is
walking through that door...

01:59.020 --> 02:00.499
Hello, Douglas.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.859
Victoria!

02:02.860 --> 02:06.859
But I thought you were dead!

02:10.220 --> 02:14.219
I must say, Douglas, you still
don't seem very pleased to see me.

02:17.260 --> 02:20.819
No, no, I must have eaten
some bad stereo system.

02:20.820 --> 02:22.099
How's the wine?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.459
How's the wine? Exquisite.

02:23.460 --> 02:26.019
From the chef's own cellar.

02:26.020 --> 02:29.859
What are you doing, Victoria?
Last time I saw you, you were...

02:29.860 --> 02:32.899
Washing the car? Yes, I
imagine you have many questions.

02:32.900 --> 02:36.659
I was under a lot of stress that
day, Douglas. I think we both were.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.259
We both knew it wasn't working.

02:38.260 --> 02:41.379
I picked up my sponge and bucket
with a heavy heart that day.

02:41.380 --> 02:44.459
The rest is a blank.The next thing
I can remember with any clarity

02:44.460 --> 02:47.299
is being on a kayaking
holiday two years later.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.819
That looks good, what's that?

02:48.820 --> 02:51.099
I sort of wish I'd ordered that.

02:51.100 --> 02:55.099
Our invisible desserts have arrived!

02:55.300 --> 02:58.619
I know we weren't happy that second
week of our marriage, Douglas,

02:58.620 --> 03:00.859
but give us another chance, as a couple.

03:00.860 --> 03:03.139
I don't know.

03:03.140 --> 03:06.899
I don't think we can just
pick up from where we left off.

03:06.900 --> 03:10.539
No, Victoria, I'm sorry, it's over.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.419
Oh God!

03:16.420 --> 03:19.779
I forgot you could do that.

03:19.780 --> 03:23.779
Maybe we should give it another go!

03:25.260 --> 03:27.859
Nnngh...

03:27.860 --> 03:30.379
Well that is new!

03:30.380 --> 03:31.619
How are you doing that?

03:31.620 --> 03:35.619
That might be the dog.

03:36.020 --> 03:37.539
Heston!

03:37.540 --> 03:39.659
I'd like to introduce you to my...

03:39.660 --> 03:43.659
Wi-i-i-ife.

03:46.420 --> 03:50.219
I want to divorce my wife.

03:50.220 --> 03:51.259
Why are you telling me?

03:51.260 --> 03:52.819
Aren't you with legal?

03:52.820 --> 03:54.739
No.

03:54.740 --> 03:56.099
Remind me?

03:56.100 --> 03:58.899
IT. Relationship manager.

03:58.900 --> 04:02.419
Ah. Well then I probably shouldn't
have told you any of that.

04:02.420 --> 04:04.059
Anyway...

04:04.060 --> 04:06.459
I want to divorce her right now.

04:06.460 --> 04:08.859
Now's too late. Before now.

04:08.860 --> 04:11.979
In fact, I want to have already
divorced her, is that possible?

04:11.980 --> 04:14.539
Well, as I said, I'm not a lawyer, so...

04:14.540 --> 04:18.539
Yes, but you're a relationship
manager, and this is a relationship!

04:19.660 --> 04:21.259
Well, erm...

04:21.260 --> 04:22.699
have you told her yet?

04:22.700 --> 04:26.699
Kind of. I changed my
Friendface profile from "married"

04:27.260 --> 04:29.859
to "it's complicated".

04:29.860 --> 04:32.859
That's not the same as
telling her, Mr. Reynholm.

04:32.860 --> 04:34.699
Yeah, but someone will
pass it on. Why not you?

04:34.700 --> 04:35.579
Yeah, but someone will
pass it on. Why not you? No!

04:35.580 --> 04:38.019
Oh come on! Please break up with

04:38.020 --> 04:40.939
my vanishing, car cleaning
wife! I don't want to do it!

04:40.940 --> 04:42.459
I don't want to do it!

04:42.460 --> 04:44.259
I'll give you...I don't know...

04:44.260 --> 04:49.419
10,000.

04:49.420 --> 04:50.619
Who are you again?

04:50.620 --> 04:52.459
I'm Jen Barber.

04:52.460 --> 04:56.459
I'm with the IT department
at Reynholm Industries.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.819
Sorry, I thought I
was meeting my husband.

04:58.820 --> 05:04.319
Mr. Reynholm asked me to
convey a... a message to you.

05:15.260 --> 05:16.779
Mrs. Reynholm.

05:16.780 --> 05:19.499
How long have you and Mr.
Reynholm known each other?

05:19.500 --> 05:20.579
About ten years.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.939
Ten years, ten wonderful years.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.939
Who are you?

05:24.940 --> 05:27.779
Mrs. Reynholm... Can
I call you Victoria?

05:27.780 --> 05:28.299
No.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.659
Mrs. Reynholm.

05:29.660 --> 05:33.659
Sometimes there is a day
and then there is a night.

05:34.180 --> 05:37.699
Sometimes there is a morn,

05:37.700 --> 05:39.859
and then there is an eve.

05:39.860 --> 05:43.859
Flowers grow, trees are cut down,

05:44.380 --> 05:47.299
babies are born, but...

05:47.300 --> 05:49.019
Lawyers exist.

05:49.020 --> 05:53.019
What are you trying to say?

05:53.060 --> 05:55.859
Oh, I can't do it, I just can't.

05:55.860 --> 05:58.179
Let me guess. My
husband wants to leave me

05:58.180 --> 06:02.179
and he paid you a large amount of money to
spare him the embarrassment of facing me.

06:02.540 --> 06:05.779
Yes, but I'm not going to
take the money... I feel sick.

06:05.780 --> 06:08.699
Of course you do,
you're a normal person.

06:08.700 --> 06:10.299
You're not upset?

06:10.300 --> 06:12.899
No, because I'm not a normal person.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.379
You see, what you're trying
to do here but can't...

06:15.380 --> 06:18.379
If the tables were turned, I
wouldn't find it difficult at all.

06:18.380 --> 06:22.379
In fact, it's how I met his first wife.

06:23.220 --> 06:25.819
I didn't know these were edible too.

06:25.820 --> 06:29.819
They're not.

06:34.220 --> 06:35.579
What's all that?

06:35.580 --> 06:37.979
What's all that? I have to
spend the afternoon with Douglas.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.939
Somehow I've been drafted
into his legal eagle fantasy.

06:40.940 --> 06:43.459
Have you ever spent any
serious time with that man?

06:43.460 --> 06:46.539
He's unbelievable! You should
hear the way he talks about women.

06:46.540 --> 06:50.539
Oh yeah, he's some piece of
work. He's like a sexy Hitler.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.659
I mean, I don't expect
to put on a pedal stool,

06:53.660 --> 06:55.779
but please, show a little respect!

06:55.780 --> 06:58.019
I'm sorry, you don't
expect to be put on a what?

06:58.020 --> 07:00.099
On a pedal stool.

07:00.100 --> 07:04.099
A pedal stool?

07:04.460 --> 07:06.499
What's a pedal stool?

07:06.500 --> 07:08.739
Oh, you know, you put women on it

07:08.740 --> 07:10.819
when you admire them,
you know, the phrase.

07:10.820 --> 07:14.819
Oh yeah, the famous phrase,
"to be put on a pedal stool".

07:15.780 --> 07:17.019
"Pedestal"!

07:17.020 --> 07:18.059
What?

07:18.060 --> 07:19.859
"Pedestal" is the word!

07:19.860 --> 07:22.059
What's a "pedal stool"?!

07:22.060 --> 07:25.579
Did you really think there was
such a thing as a pedal stool?

07:25.580 --> 07:28.379
Shut up, everyone has blind spots.

07:28.380 --> 07:32.339
Can you help me sort through all
this legal crap, please, Moss?

07:32.340 --> 07:36.099
I'd rather not. I've not had good
experiences with the legal system.

07:36.100 --> 07:36.979
How come?

07:36.980 --> 07:40.979
How come? Well, when I was 11, I broke
the patio window, and my mother sued me.

07:41.620 --> 07:43.699
She sued you?

07:43.700 --> 07:46.259
Yeah, to teach me a lesson.

07:46.260 --> 07:49.899
She's always been a very
aggressive litigator.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.059
Can you even do that,
can you sue your children?

07:52.060 --> 07:55.179
It was kind of a show
trial in the kitchen.

07:55.180 --> 07:56.579
She made a little gallery for the cat.

07:56.580 --> 07:59.339
She made a little gallery for
the cat. Aw... What happened?

07:59.340 --> 08:01.619
She won.

08:01.620 --> 08:04.499
I'm still paying costs.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.499
"Pedal stool"!

08:10.460 --> 08:12.819
212 million quid!

08:12.820 --> 08:14.859
You can't be serious!

08:14.860 --> 08:16.859
Oh, we're quite serious, Mr. Reynholm.

08:16.860 --> 08:20.139
But that's enough to bring
Reynholm Industries to its knees!

08:20.140 --> 08:23.659
Bloody blast, this is up my arse!

08:23.660 --> 08:26.699
That is the amount, it
is not up for negotiation.

08:26.700 --> 08:29.859
Balls from hell, you shit-twins!

08:29.860 --> 08:31.099
Calm down, Mr. Reynholm.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.899
Bollocks to be telling me
to calm down, my old chap.

08:33.900 --> 08:37.899
She wants 220 titty million quid
and you tell me to calm down!

08:38.020 --> 08:39.259
You're fired.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.299
I'm not your lawyer.

08:40.299 --> 08:43.619
Piss off! I'm going to represent myself.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.859
I'm not your lawyer.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.899
You sit there, all confident.

08:47.900 --> 08:51.659
Yeah? But when this goes to Court,
that's when the talking stops.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.459
Mr. Reynholm,

08:53.460 --> 08:55.859
there might actually be
more talking in Court,

08:55.860 --> 08:59.499
this would actually be a comparatively small
amount of talking, what we're doing here.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.419
Oh, I see.

09:00.420 --> 09:00.979
Sorry.

09:00.980 --> 09:04.419
Sorry. No, that's all right,
it's what I pay you for.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.019
Look at her. Cold as ice.

09:06.020 --> 09:10.019
But I tell you this, behind
those shades, she's terrified.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.539
One thing you should
know about me, Jen...

09:18.540 --> 09:21.699
When I put my mind to
something, it gets done.

09:21.700 --> 09:25.299
Representing myself is the
kind of challenge I relish.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.539
Well, you'll have to
do a lot of preparation.

09:27.540 --> 09:30.219
Bring it on!

09:51.980 --> 09:54.499
What's this?

09:54.500 --> 09:57.899
It's my suit. I made it
myself. Took me a few days!

09:57.900 --> 10:00.619
How did you find time
to prepare for the trial?

10:00.620 --> 10:03.419
How did I what?

10:03.420 --> 10:06.339
Mrs. Reynholm, you saythat in
the short time you were married,

10:06.340 --> 10:09.179
you became indispensable
to Mr. Reynholm...

10:09.180 --> 10:11.739
in what way were you indispensable?

10:11.740 --> 10:13.539
I had to brush his teeth.

10:13.540 --> 10:14.779
Really?

10:14.780 --> 10:15.979
Yes.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.339
That's not an expression?

10:17.340 --> 10:18.619
No.

10:18.620 --> 10:19.859
You got the brush,

10:19.860 --> 10:22.579
you applied toothpaste to it,

10:22.580 --> 10:25.419
you moved it into his mouth...

10:25.420 --> 10:29.419
and moved your hand up and down.

10:29.820 --> 10:31.779
Well, if I didn't do
it, he wouldn't do it.

10:31.780 --> 10:35.379
Well, if I didn't do it, he wouldn't
do it. Make a note... "brush teeth".

10:35.380 --> 10:38.219
Now, you're asking for
quite a large amount.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.019
I think it is an appropriate amount.

10:40.020 --> 10:41.659
Bollocks.

10:41.660 --> 10:42.939
Mr. Reynholm.

10:42.940 --> 10:45.499
Yes, your honour?

10:45.500 --> 10:49.499
I would ask you to refrain from using
that kind of language in my courtroom.

10:49.540 --> 10:53.539
And which word in particular
do you object to, your honour?

10:54.980 --> 10:56.779
You only said one.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.139
Could you read it back?

10:58.140 --> 10:59.579
"Bollocks".

10:59.580 --> 11:03.579
Don't read it back!

11:04.020 --> 11:07.179
Why do you say it is
an appropriate amount?

11:07.180 --> 11:09.379
Mr. Reynholm caused me great distress.

11:09.380 --> 11:11.299
I'm entitledto some restitution.

11:11.300 --> 11:15.299
Besides, it's not as if he ever put the
money to good use. As the film proves.

11:16.260 --> 11:19.659
Your honour, may I present the
central exhibit to our case...

11:19.660 --> 11:21.659
It is, I'm afraid, a sex tape.

11:21.660 --> 11:23.859
A sex tape?

11:23.860 --> 11:27.859
Which one?

11:40.580 --> 11:44.579
The alien craft appears to
have dropped its shields.

11:44.940 --> 11:48.659
Thank you, Female Chekhov! Female
Sulu, beam their Captain aboard.

11:48.660 --> 11:51.979
But... Captain...are you sure?

11:51.980 --> 11:54.259
But she's hurt, she may need our help.

11:54.260 --> 11:58.259
Jim, even if she's injured as
you say, I can't do an examination

11:58.340 --> 12:00.579
on a new species
without proper research.

12:00.580 --> 12:03.099
Dammit, Jim, I'm a sexy doctor,

12:03.100 --> 12:05.499
not a sexy scientist!

12:05.500 --> 12:08.099
Female Sulu. You have your orders.

12:08.100 --> 12:10.939
Perhaps the good doctor thinks

12:10.940 --> 12:13.939
certain alien species do not
fall under the Hippocratic oath.

12:13.940 --> 12:17.939
I have never refused treatment to a
patient, Female Spock, and you know that!

12:24.820 --> 12:26.739
I think we've seen enough.

12:26.740 --> 12:29.179
Your Honour, I object!

12:29.180 --> 12:33.179
There's a brilliant bit coming up.

12:33.740 --> 12:37.739
Mr. Reynholm, are you ready to start
your cross-examination of Mrs. Reynholm?

12:38.180 --> 12:41.299
I am, your Honour, but rest assured,

12:41.300 --> 12:43.579
it will be a normal examination.

12:43.580 --> 12:47.579
I am not in any way cross.

12:48.860 --> 12:52.099
You are Victoria Reynholm, are you not?

12:52.100 --> 12:54.499
Mr. Reynholm, we have
already established that.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.739
Might I suggest that you try less
to do an impression of a lawyer

12:57.740 --> 13:01.739
you once saw on the television and make
your case as simply as you possibly can.

13:03.220 --> 13:07.179
Wise words, my learned lud.

13:07.180 --> 13:11.179
Victoria, you've spoken
about the real me,

13:11.300 --> 13:15.259
and I think it's time we heard
a little about the real you.

13:15.260 --> 13:16.939
Isn't it true, that you...

13:16.940 --> 13:20.939
Used to be a man?

13:22.340 --> 13:23.699
No.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.419
It isn't true, you say?

13:25.420 --> 13:27.139
It is untrue.

13:27.140 --> 13:31.139
Who am I thinking of?

13:31.540 --> 13:35.539
I think you mean April, the
woman you had a fight with.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.859
No further questions, my lud.

13:40.860 --> 13:43.939
What? Your entire case rested on that?

13:43.940 --> 13:45.619
Yes, your Honour.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.419
Yes, your Honour. No, wait, Mr
Reynholm, you can't leave it at that.

13:47.420 --> 13:51.419
Your Honour, may I confer with my
relationship manager? What's up, Jen?

13:52.100 --> 13:55.739
You've got to request more time
to prepare a proper defence.

13:55.740 --> 13:58.739
Your Grace, may I approach the bench?

13:58.740 --> 14:00.379
Have you brushed your teeth?

14:00.380 --> 14:01.179
No.

14:01.180 --> 14:03.659
No. Then you may not.

14:03.660 --> 14:05.939
Your Grace,

14:05.940 --> 14:09.099
I need to prepare a proper defence.

14:09.100 --> 14:13.099
The one I just did there was rubbish.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.979
Yes, he's some piece of work.

14:17.980 --> 14:21.299
We're all very happy
at Reynholm Industries.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.539
Are you telling the truth?

14:23.540 --> 14:24.819
Yes.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.059
Then why are you
so ill-at-ease?

14:27.060 --> 14:29.299
Well...

14:29.300 --> 14:32.659
If you must know... I was in
a court myself very recently...

14:32.660 --> 14:35.099
This very courtroom in fact,

14:35.100 --> 14:39.099
where I gave testimony
against a former soldier who...

14:40.580 --> 14:44.579
I was having a massage and he
kissed me on my bottom, Your Honour.

14:44.620 --> 14:47.299
I see.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.739
I'm sure you can
understand my discomfort.

14:49.740 --> 14:52.099
Are you all right? Can you continue?

14:52.100 --> 14:54.419
I can continue. Thank you.

14:54.420 --> 14:58.419
The way you tell it, your employer
sounds like a paragon of virtue.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.899
That's right. And
furthermore, I would like

15:02.900 --> 15:06.899
to say at this point that I think
this whole case to be a damp squid.

15:06.980 --> 15:09.819
Thank you, no further questions.

15:09.820 --> 15:12.339
Oooh! I have one more
question, your Honour.

15:12.340 --> 15:13.899
Yes?

15:13.900 --> 15:17.659
What did you say?

15:17.660 --> 15:18.699
What?

15:18.700 --> 15:21.819
What did you say the case was?
May I have it read back please?

15:21.820 --> 15:25.019
"I believe this entire case
to be a bit of a damp squid."

15:25.020 --> 15:27.379
"A damp squid?"

15:27.380 --> 15:29.259
What does that mean?

15:29.260 --> 15:32.899
Oh, Jen, it's an expression.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.459
It means that I believe

15:35.460 --> 15:38.659
that everything that's been said
in this case, everyone already knew.

15:38.660 --> 15:40.659
Yes, but did you say "damp squid"?

15:40.660 --> 15:42.139
That's right.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.819
Did you not mean, "damp squib"?

15:44.820 --> 15:48.059
No, it's "squid".

15:48.060 --> 15:50.699
What's a squib?

15:50.700 --> 15:53.499
It's not "squid".
Squids are already damp!

15:53.500 --> 15:56.179
Hence the phrase!

15:56.180 --> 15:57.459
Your Honour! Please!

15:57.460 --> 15:59.019
It is "squib".

15:59.020 --> 16:02.419
I must say, I find it extraordinary
that you, a man in your early 30s,

16:02.420 --> 16:06.419
could have reached this point in your
life without knowing that it is "squib".

16:08.820 --> 16:10.059
I think it's "squid".

16:10.060 --> 16:11.619
I have no further questions.

16:11.620 --> 16:12.739
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

16:12.740 --> 16:13.459
That will be all.

16:13.460 --> 16:14.739
Everyone has a blind spot!

16:14.740 --> 16:18.739
I said that will be all!

16:21.540 --> 16:25.219
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

16:31.420 --> 16:35.419
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

16:36.900 --> 16:40.899
Sorry, bit nervous... So... Yeah...

16:42.420 --> 16:43.659
Fizzy! It's very fizzy.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.539
It's fizzy. Gone fizzy.

16:46.020 --> 16:48.819
Ow, come on!

16:48.820 --> 16:51.379
That's electric. That's
electric in there.

16:51.380 --> 16:54.139
Just got a shock.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.819
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

16:56.820 --> 16:58.739
It is not.

16:58.740 --> 17:02.659
Sorry, yeah, sorry, sorry.

17:02.660 --> 17:05.098
My mother sued me.

17:05.099 --> 17:07.539
Relax. Take your time.

17:07.540 --> 17:10.618
Try to answer the questions
as clearly as you can.

17:10.619 --> 17:14.618
Thank you, my love.

17:22.060 --> 17:26.059
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

17:27.339 --> 17:31.339
Chair. It was the chair's fault.

17:53.580 --> 17:57.579
No further questions, my lud.

18:36.980 --> 18:38.419
Don't you have anything?

18:38.420 --> 18:41.899
She's going to take you to
the cleaners, Mr. Reynholm.

18:41.900 --> 18:45.899
Yup, I suppose she will.

18:51.020 --> 18:54.979
What's that?

18:54.980 --> 18:57.499
Oh, God.

18:57.500 --> 19:01.499
I think I may have found our miracle.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.499
Can you state your full name, please?

19:06.500 --> 19:10.499
Richmond Felicity Avenal.

19:14.300 --> 19:17.019
And you worked at Reynholm
Industries for a time?

19:17.020 --> 19:18.499
I did, for over four years.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.779
And what did you do?

19:19.780 --> 19:22.699
I don't know.

19:22.700 --> 19:23.899
Why did you leave?

19:23.900 --> 19:27.259
Well, my life wasn't really going
anywhere. I was part of the whole

19:27.260 --> 19:30.979
goth/ death metal subculture
but it wasn't making me happy.

19:30.980 --> 19:33.259
It was all a bit gloomy.

19:33.260 --> 19:37.259
It was round about that
point that I developed scurvy.

19:37.820 --> 19:40.179
Now that sounds unpleasant.

19:40.180 --> 19:43.979
On the contrary. Catching scurvy was
the best thing that ever happened to me.

19:43.980 --> 19:46.059
It made me take a long
hard look in the mirror.

19:46.060 --> 19:48.499
And I didn't like what I
saw, I can tell you that.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.299
Not just because my
teeth had fallen out.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.619
Which is why I founded From Goth2Boss.

19:54.620 --> 19:56.779
Is it okay if I play a DVD?

19:56.780 --> 19:59.579
Does it have anything
whatsoever to do with this case?

19:59.580 --> 20:01.419
Not really, Your Honour.

20:01.420 --> 20:03.419
Then you may proceed.

20:03.420 --> 20:05.499
Where are you going? Is it to the top?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.059
If not, why not?

20:07.060 --> 20:09.819
Go to the bloody top! Is
it because you're a goth?

20:09.820 --> 20:13.339
Did you know that goths have some of
the lowest life satisfaction levels

20:13.340 --> 20:16.299
of any subculture with the
exception of traffic wardens?

20:16.300 --> 20:18.419
That's why you don't see
any goth traffic wardens.

20:18.420 --> 20:20.299
That would be a deadly combination!

20:20.300 --> 20:24.299
We at Goth2Boss work with goths
at various locations around the UK

20:24.300 --> 20:26.339
to bring out their hidden potential...

20:26.340 --> 20:30.259
by encouraging them to engage
in everyday, healthy pursuits

20:30.260 --> 20:32.899
such as sports.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.019
Mixing with other humans.

20:35.020 --> 20:37.579
Extended laughter sessions.

20:37.580 --> 20:40.379
Introducing colour to your wardrobe.

20:40.380 --> 20:42.619
Just look at these results.
This is Debbie. She used to

20:42.620 --> 20:45.339
hang around railway stations
with her hands in her sleeves.

20:45.340 --> 20:47.579
Now she's a lifeguard in Mumbai!

20:47.580 --> 20:50.819
From Goth2Boss, you know it makes
sense. Unless you're not a goth,

20:50.820 --> 20:53.779
in which case, from
Goth2Boss. Remember the name.

20:53.780 --> 20:55.659
But what does that have to do with

20:55.660 --> 20:57.979
my divorce proceedings, m'kind fellow?

20:57.980 --> 21:00.419
Well, Mr. Reynholm, I'm here
to tell you that that woman

21:00.420 --> 21:04.419
is not Victoria Reynholm!

21:05.820 --> 21:07.499
Her name is Melanie Crawford,

21:07.500 --> 21:10.739
a former From Goth2Boss pupil of mine!

21:10.740 --> 21:14.739
Sing, you canary!

21:16.260 --> 21:20.259
Well, during our sessions, she seemed
more interested in you than getting better.

21:21.100 --> 21:24.219
I don't think she ever truly
exorcised the goth within.

21:24.220 --> 21:26.299
Scratch away that fake tan

21:26.300 --> 21:30.299
and beneath you'll find
the purest white foundation!

21:32.100 --> 21:35.699
Yeah, that was more of
a phrase than anything.

21:35.700 --> 21:39.699
Oh, actually... No
sorry, that's not her!

21:40.860 --> 21:44.859
Oh, sorry about that. That's not her.

21:46.660 --> 21:49.139
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

21:49.140 --> 21:53.139
You've heard a few things over the
past few days, none of which cast me

21:54.220 --> 21:56.339
in a particularly favourable light.

21:56.340 --> 22:00.339
Stories of expensive sex tapes,
rumours of me killing my first wife.

22:01.100 --> 22:05.099
No. No-one's mentioned that.

22:08.220 --> 22:11.859
You know, there's one
thing I do want to say.

22:11.860 --> 22:15.859
Just one thing, that I...

22:22.300 --> 22:25.739
Mr. Reynholm?

22:25.740 --> 22:29.019
Mr. Reynholm, please.

22:29.020 --> 22:33.019
Mr. Reynholm, this really is the most
pathetic display I have ever seen.

22:35.140 --> 22:36.979
May I say something, your Honour?

22:36.980 --> 22:38.019
Why not?

22:38.020 --> 22:40.779
Lying here,

22:40.780 --> 22:44.779
pretending to have a heart
attack, you see a desperate man.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.019
Not pretending.

22:47.020 --> 22:50.859
Not pretending. A man who has exhausted
all of his time, all of his resources,

22:50.860 --> 22:54.859
on an expensive trial that
has resulted in humiliation.

22:58.540 --> 23:02.539
But think not of him. Think of the
employees of Reynholm Industries.

23:03.060 --> 23:05.779
Think of the man who
was sued by his mother.

23:05.780 --> 23:09.779
The simpleton who thought the
phrase "damp squid" was correct.

23:11.180 --> 23:15.179
These are the people I want you to
consider when making your judgement.

23:17.460 --> 23:21.459
For Reynholm is not just the
name of this ridiculous man

23:22.380 --> 23:26.259
who keeps opening his eyes
whenever he thinks no-one's looking.

23:26.260 --> 23:30.259
Reynholm is the name of the family
his employees have found in each other.

23:33.460 --> 23:37.339
We are all Reynholms.

23:37.340 --> 23:40.219
Hurt him, and you hurt...

23:40.220 --> 23:41.819
Oh, all right then,
we'll take 70 million.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.819
Hooray!

23:46.860 --> 23:48.859
I'm getting oak.
