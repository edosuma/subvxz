<i>Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O...

00:04.312 --> 00:06.262
What are you doing in my house?
Who are you?

00:06.264 --> 00:07.646
I'm Marco Reyes.

00:07.648 --> 00:09.782
When your brother disappeared,

00:09.784 --> 00:12.618
he was in possession of
a significant amount my money.

00:12.620 --> 00:13.786
Okay. How much money?

00:13.788 --> 00:16.155
18-and-a-half million dollars.

00:16.157 --> 00:18.874
You have until Monday to bring
my money to this address.

00:18.876 --> 00:21.160
What happens if I don't
bring you the money?

00:21.162 --> 00:24.797
You'll get a package with
your brother's head in it.

00:24.799 --> 00:25.998
<i> Three years ago,</i>
<i>Matt gets on that plane.</i>

00:26.000 --> 00:27.416
<i>Not a single piece of luggage,</i>

00:27.418 --> 00:30.169
<i>but he's supposed to have</i>
<i>18-and-a-half million dollars.</i>

00:30.171 --> 00:31.504
If that's the case,
then it's here on the island.

00:31.506 --> 00:33.005
So, what? How you
supposed to find it?

00:33.007 --> 00:34.507
About a month
after he disappeared,

00:34.509 --> 00:36.008
he sent me a postcard.

00:36.010 --> 00:37.476
Yeah? What'd it say?
Did it mention the money?

00:37.478 --> 00:38.511
No, he didn't mention the money.

00:38.513 --> 00:39.562
He just wrote,
“Wish you were here.”

00:39.564 --> 00:40.980
It was a picture
of this remote area

00:40.982 --> 00:44.233
on Oahu with a rock formation
and a couple of palm trees.

01:25.276 --> 01:27.893
Hey, Danny?

01:27.895 --> 01:30.112
In here.

01:39.190 --> 01:42.141
Whoa.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.710
You were right.

01:44.712 --> 01:46.912
Yeah. Um...

01:46.914 --> 01:51.300
Except for the fact that, uh,
Reyes said that Matty owed him

01:51.302 --> 01:52.918
18-and-a-half million dollars.

01:52.920 --> 01:56.589
You see, this is only
$13 million.

01:56.591 --> 01:58.307
Are you sure?

01:58.309 --> 02:00.559
Yes, I am positive--
I counted it three times.

02:00.561 --> 02:03.896
So, Matty must have taken some
to help himself disappear.

02:03.898 --> 02:05.431
Yeah.

02:05.433 --> 02:06.815
And now I am, uh,

02:06.817 --> 02:08.767
five-and-a-half million
dollars short.

02:08.769 --> 02:10.769
And I have two days to come up
with all of it,

02:10.770 --> 02:13.355
or, um... my brother's dead.

03:12.633 --> 03:14.166

Right. Well, if it meant
saving my brother,

04:13.027 --> 04:14.359

04:14.361 --> 04:15.611

04:20.067 --> 04:21.700
I really don't see
any other ways.

04:23.487 --> 04:25.120
I may have one.

04:30.411 --> 04:32.244
Aloha and welcome

04:32.246 --> 04:35.247
to Honolulu

04:35.249 --> 04:38.967
Please proceed to baggage claim
to collect all checked bags.

04:38.969 --> 04:42.471
We hope you enjoy a wonderful
stay in our island paradise.

Mahalo.

04:43.891 --> 04:45.808
Excuse me, Mr. Bristol?
Gordon Bristol?

04:45.810 --> 04:47.760
I'm Gordon Bristol.

04:47.762 --> 04:50.095
Sir, can you please
come with us?

05:06.030 --> 05:07.030
What's going on?

05:07.031 --> 05:08.363
Have I done something wrong?

05:09.784 --> 05:12.251
Why did you come to
Hawaii, Mr. Bristol?

05:12.253 --> 05:14.002
Why does anyone come to Hawaii?

05:14.004 --> 05:15.454
See the ocean, work on my tan.

05:15.456 --> 05:16.456
Is that a problem?

05:16.457 --> 05:18.590
Is this your bag, sir?

05:19.677 --> 05:22.127
Yes.

05:22.129 --> 05:25.681
Mr. Bristol, we randomly search
luggage for security reasons,

05:25.683 --> 05:28.433
and your bag came
to our attention.

05:31.105 --> 05:33.272
Would you like to explain

05:33.274 --> 05:36.809
why you were transporting a
weapon onto the island of Oahu?

05:42.066 --> 05:43.699
There's been a mistake.

05:43.701 --> 05:45.651
I... have never seen
that before in my life.

05:45.653 --> 05:46.869
I don't even own a gun.

05:46.871 --> 05:48.654
Mr. Bristol,

05:48.656 --> 05:50.823
illegal transportation
of an unregistered firearm,

05:50.825 --> 05:52.908
as well as being in possession
of a sound suppressor

05:52.910 --> 05:54.376
are felonies in
the state of Hawaii,

05:54.378 --> 05:57.462
as well as being a violation
of Federal statutes.

05:57.464 --> 05:58.831
I'm afraid we're gonna
be detaining you,

05:58.833 --> 05:59.833
pending Federal arrest.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.216
If you'll
please stand up,

06:01.218 --> 06:02.538
place your hands
behind your back.

06:48.382 --> 06:49.754
<i>Was fur ein spiel.</i>

06:49.755 --> 06:51.305
<i>Unglaublich,</i>
<i>wie wir zuruckkamen,</i>

06:51.307 --> 06:52.994
<i>um zu gewinnen.</i>

06:52.995 --> 06:54.328
What a match.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.571
I am surprised
we came back to win.

06:57.038 --> 06:59.955
All right.

07:02.110 --> 07:05.044
Coconut shrimp.

07:05.046 --> 07:06.796
Sweet and sour sauce?

07:06.798 --> 07:07.798
All you can dip.

07:07.799 --> 07:08.747
Mmm.

07:08.749 --> 07:10.883
From the ocean
to the deep fryer,

07:10.885 --> 07:13.335
to your
sophisticated palate.

07:13.337 --> 07:15.171
I am most pleased

07:15.173 --> 07:18.057
that our midfielders played
with aggression.

07:18.059 --> 07:20.259
Surveillance suspect
sounds like a robot.

07:20.261 --> 07:21.844
That's a computer program.

07:21.846 --> 07:23.512
The guy in the bookstore
is speaking German,

07:23.514 --> 07:24.814
and I don't speak German.

07:24.816 --> 07:28.734
It is also fortuitous that
the keeper cleared the foot

07:28.736 --> 07:30.719
to prevent the equalizer
from drinking.

07:30.721 --> 07:33.072
And your robot needs
to work on its English.

07:35.359 --> 07:37.076
So, I take it
there's been no chatter

07:37.078 --> 07:38.527
about the counterfeiting?

07:38.529 --> 07:40.079
No, just a bunch
of talk about soccer.

07:40.081 --> 07:43.165
But I'm convinced our
guy's gonna broker a deal

07:43.167 --> 07:45.951
with the German to unload his
counterfeit money any day now.

07:45.953 --> 07:48.254
Or... maybe
they just like soccer.

07:48.256 --> 07:52.341
You know, in other countries,
they call it football?

07:52.343 --> 07:54.543
Doesn't seem right.

07:54.545 --> 07:56.212
Trust me, he's just
luring his buyer

07:56.214 --> 07:58.380
with a mutual affection
for sports.

07:58.382 --> 08:00.216
Just laying the groundwork
for the deal.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.434
And when he makes it,
I'll be listening.

08:02.436 --> 08:06.138
So I take it you're gonna
need more shrimp.

08:06.140 --> 08:08.274
I'll just throw it
on your tab.

08:08.276 --> 08:10.226
In my experience,

08:10.228 --> 08:13.229
the key to surveillance is
patience and stamina.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.813
Your experience?

08:14.815 --> 08:16.148
Trust me.

08:16.150 --> 08:17.983
It's only a matter of time

08:17.985 --> 08:19.902
before he slips up
and proves me right.

08:23.291 --> 08:24.790
<i>Got a real mess in there.</i>

08:24.792 --> 08:28.744
Our suspect is traveling
under the name Gordon Bristol.

08:28.746 --> 08:30.079
That's an alias.

08:30.081 --> 08:32.581
We know that he boarded the
red eye from Detroit last night.

08:32.582 --> 08:34.033
His luggage
gets flagged...

08:34.034 --> 08:36.802
because of this.

08:36.804 --> 08:39.087
Beretta 92FS,

08:39.090 --> 08:42.758
with an extra 15-round clip
and a cobra sound suppressor.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.677
That's not exactly
a sportsman's gun.

08:44.679 --> 08:45.978
Where is this guy Bristol now?
What happened?

08:45.980 --> 08:47.313
Oh, he escaped.

08:47.315 --> 08:50.933
But not before he took down five
guys in the TSA holding room.

08:50.935 --> 08:53.402
Five guys?
Took down five guys by himself?

08:53.404 --> 08:54.620
With his bare hands.

08:57.108 --> 08:58.657
All right, Lou, listen to me:

08:58.659 --> 08:59.858
Contact Detroit PD.

08:59.860 --> 09:01.193
Let's get them prints,
surveillance photos,

09:01.195 --> 09:02.411
whatever we can of this guy,

09:02.413 --> 09:04.496
see if they can tell us
who he really is.

09:04.498 --> 09:06.165
All right, you got it.

09:15.126 --> 09:17.876
Gas must be cheap these days,
'cause this is the second time

09:17.878 --> 09:19.595
that you've come
out here for nothing.

09:19.597 --> 09:21.297
I'm not here about
my problem with IA.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.932
Right.

09:22.934 --> 09:24.633
Because if you were,
you'd be on your knees,

09:24.635 --> 09:26.602
begging me to tell them
you didn't take my bribe.

09:26.604 --> 09:28.687
Well, if the truth
still matters,

09:28.689 --> 09:30.155
I've got nothing to worry about.

09:31.392 --> 09:34.276
Good luck with that.

09:36.063 --> 09:39.315
Looks like you've been having
trouble making friends in here.

09:40.651 --> 09:42.484
I got enough friends
on the outside.

09:42.486 --> 09:44.053
So do I.

09:44.055 --> 09:46.538
I'm here about one of them.

09:47.908 --> 09:48.958
Let me guess.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.993
This pal of yours
is in trouble.

09:50.995 --> 09:52.828
Needs some sort
of financial assistance.

09:54.048 --> 09:56.215
This isn't for me.

09:56.217 --> 09:57.833
And there's a clock on this.

09:57.835 --> 09:59.184
He's almost out of options.

10:02.890 --> 10:04.840
How much help does
your friend need?

10:05.843 --> 10:08.427
Five-and-a-half million
dollars' worth.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.348
Oh, is that all?

10:12.350 --> 10:15.567
And if the money isn't there?

10:15.569 --> 10:17.486
My friend's brother dies.

10:22.743 --> 10:26.195
Tell your friend I'll give him
500 for a black suit.

10:30.418 --> 10:32.284
We're done here.

10:40.928 --> 10:42.661
Guy's real name is Stegner,
first name Joseph.

10:42.663 --> 10:44.380
38 years old.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.597
No known employment history

10:45.599 --> 10:48.684
outside the
construction business.

10:48.686 --> 10:50.736
He owns a house in
West Bloomfield, Michigan--

10:50.738 --> 10:53.122
tony little suburb
outside of Detroit.

10:53.124 --> 10:55.974
This guy lives pretty high
on the hog for somebody

10:55.976 --> 10:57.976
who supposedly spent his whole
life swinging a hammer.

10:57.978 --> 10:59.528
Got a criminal record?

10:59.530 --> 11:00.646
Well, according to Detroit PD,

11:00.648 --> 11:03.048
Stegner's name's
been connected

11:03.050 --> 11:05.417
to a few beat-downs
and a couple homicides,

11:05.419 --> 11:06.618
the first being
a gunned-down

11:06.620 --> 11:08.253
union boss,
and the second

11:08.255 --> 11:10.072
a juror who was killed
in a hit and run.

11:10.074 --> 11:12.825
Now, Stegner has been
brought in a few times

11:12.827 --> 11:14.910
for questioning
on both these murders.

11:14.912 --> 11:16.578
Never charged.

11:16.580 --> 11:18.547
Okay, so organized crime

11:18.549 --> 11:20.883
is alive and well
up in the Motor City.

11:20.885 --> 11:22.251
Yes, sir.

11:22.253 --> 11:23.385
And according to his jacket,

11:23.387 --> 11:26.972
Stegner is supposed
to have close ties

11:26.974 --> 11:30.259
with the Bagosa family.

11:30.261 --> 11:31.810
And what do we know about them?

11:31.812 --> 11:33.545
The Bagosa family is one of

11:33.547 --> 11:36.482
the 24 original crime families.

11:36.484 --> 11:38.233
Now, most people,
when they think of Detroit,

11:38.235 --> 11:39.685
they think about either cars

11:39.687 --> 11:41.603
or being the murder capitol
of the country.

11:41.605 --> 11:44.273
The Bagosa family
is one of the most active

11:44.275 --> 11:46.108
crime syndicates in the country.

11:46.110 --> 11:49.094
And that is because of this guy.

11:49.096 --> 11:50.863
Albert Bagosa,

11:50.865 --> 11:52.614
third-generation
crime boss.

11:52.616 --> 11:53.866
Rules with
an iron fist.

11:53.868 --> 11:56.869
The guy simply will not
tolerate dissent.

11:57.755 --> 11:59.621
Okay, so Bagosa sends

11:59.623 --> 12:01.173
Stegner down here
to do a job,

12:01.175 --> 12:02.424
with his tools.

12:02.426 --> 12:04.293
He gets snagged by
a random bag check,

12:04.295 --> 12:06.879
is detained and
then escapes, right?

12:06.881 --> 12:08.847
Right. The question is,
who is the target,

12:08.849 --> 12:11.633
and is Stegner still planning
on taking them out?

12:13.471 --> 12:14.887
Hey, security cameras
at the Ward Center

12:14.889 --> 12:16.772
just picked up our suspect.

12:18.192 --> 12:20.359
Well... you gotta
give the guy some credit.

12:20.361 --> 12:21.727
He ain't scared
of too much.

12:21.729 --> 12:23.112
Well, he left
the airport in a hurry.

12:23.114 --> 12:24.480
He's probably trying
to drain all of his accounts

12:24.482 --> 12:26.064
before they get shut down.

12:26.066 --> 12:27.983
All right, that ATM is in
the center of the mall.

12:27.985 --> 12:30.035
Kono, use those security cameras
to track him out of there.

12:30.037 --> 12:32.371
And call HPD, tell them
to secure the perimeter.

12:32.373 --> 12:34.206
Every street.
We're on our way.

12:47.171 --> 12:48.520
Kono, you got him?

12:48.522 --> 12:50.839
He's heading east,
past the movie theaters.

12:50.841 --> 12:52.925
HPD has the perimeter
locked down.

13:02.820 --> 13:03.936
Hey, I got him.

13:03.938 --> 13:05.003
I got him.
Easy, easy.

13:05.005 --> 13:06.405
A lot of collateral.

13:29.163 --> 13:31.096
We've been compromised.

13:33.350 --> 13:35.634
Kono, don't lose him.

13:37.271 --> 13:38.804
He's headed for Ala Moana.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.571
Hold it right there!
Hold it right there!

13:55.573 --> 13:57.072
Don't move!

13:58.225 --> 13:59.408
Get down on the ground!

13:59.410 --> 14:01.250
On your knees, put your
hands behind your head.

14:03.998 --> 14:05.831
Okay, okay...

14:10.170 --> 14:11.170
I don't have him.

15:08.152 --> 15:09.985
Does this make any sense to you?

15:10.117 --> 15:12.265
A contract killer
comes into town

15:12.265 --> 15:13.514
to do a piece of work,

15:13.516 --> 15:15.099
and then he's the one
who gets taken out.

15:15.101 --> 15:17.985
Could be the intended target
finds out about Stegner,

15:17.987 --> 15:20.771
decides to get preemptive
and gets the jump on him.

15:20.773 --> 15:22.356
If that's the case,

15:22.358 --> 15:24.508
our man is no
ordinary mark.

15:24.510 --> 15:26.827
He took out a major bad-ass
from 100 yards away

15:26.829 --> 15:28.212
and then escaped
a police cordon.

15:28.214 --> 15:29.580
Yeah.

15:29.582 --> 15:31.365
Great. So we traded up.

15:31.367 --> 15:34.035
Commander, HPD just found
the suspect's vehicle

15:34.037 --> 15:35.369
abandoned at George Street.

15:35.371 --> 15:37.121
Detective Williams
is already on the way.

15:37.123 --> 15:39.373
Go, go ahead.
I got this.

15:45.848 --> 15:47.048
You find anything?

15:47.050 --> 15:48.015
Blood.

15:48.017 --> 15:49.767
Look like you hit him.

15:54.057 --> 15:55.690
Hey, Pua?

15:55.692 --> 15:58.359
Have CSU process this vehicle

15:58.361 --> 16:00.645
and get officers searching
every hospital on the island.

16:00.647 --> 16:02.063
All right?
Yes, Commander.

16:02.065 --> 16:03.397
You really think
this is the kind of guy

16:03.399 --> 16:04.699
that's going to go
to the hospital?

16:04.701 --> 16:06.534
Maybe we'll get lucky
and he'll drop dead

16:06.536 --> 16:08.369
before it's a consideration.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.540
I'm starving.

16:14.377 --> 16:15.960
What did
you end up getting?

16:15.962 --> 16:18.412
Same as always.
Can't go wrong.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.467
You try the spicy?

16:31.644 --> 16:33.978
Take it to go.

16:43.823 --> 16:45.773
Still no word from Chin?

16:45.775 --> 16:47.942
No.

16:50.113 --> 16:52.029
You know what, partner?

16:52.031 --> 16:55.833
We can get on a plane
right now and settle this.

16:55.835 --> 16:58.119
You see, that is why
I love you, buddy.

16:58.121 --> 17:00.421
You're always willing
to risk both of our lives

17:00.423 --> 17:01.956
at any given moment, huh?

17:01.958 --> 17:03.924
Listen, man, I'll go
through the door first

17:03.926 --> 17:06.844
if it makes you feel better.
Oh, you would?

17:30.036 --> 17:31.952
What's up?

17:31.954 --> 17:33.954
Danny, I'm sorry.

17:37.910 --> 17:41.962
Look, you're just gonna
have to set new terms.

17:41.964 --> 17:43.297
Go down there
in a couple of days,

17:43.299 --> 17:44.915
give Reyes half the money,
and then tell him

17:44.917 --> 17:46.584
he'll get the other half
when Matty's released.

17:46.586 --> 17:48.002
That's great. That's great.

17:48.004 --> 17:51.889
What happens when he finds out
I do not have the other half?

17:51.891 --> 17:53.924
That I am five and a half
million dollars short?

17:53.926 --> 17:55.226
And what
does he do?

17:55.228 --> 17:56.594
He comes here,
and he takes Grace?

17:56.596 --> 17:59.230
I can't do that.
Okay, this thing ends,

17:59.232 --> 18:02.066
and that son of a bitch
gets every penny, okay?

18:02.068 --> 18:04.602
Thank you for trying.

18:10.526 --> 18:12.076
So I ran that blood
you guys found

18:12.078 --> 18:13.844
in your gunman's car
and got a hit.

18:14.781 --> 18:16.947
Meet Nick Mercer.

18:16.949 --> 18:19.834
Michigan authorities say he is
a highly skilled and proficient

18:19.836 --> 18:21.285
contract killer
for the Bagosa family.

18:21.287 --> 18:22.820
That's the same

18:22.822 --> 18:24.922
crime family Stegner worked for.

18:24.924 --> 18:27.374
Okay, so we got one hit man
killing another hit man.

18:27.376 --> 18:28.926
What are we looking at here?

18:28.928 --> 18:30.461
Family feud?
Personal vendetta?

18:30.463 --> 18:33.214
Maybe Stegner offended
Bagosa in some way,

18:33.216 --> 18:35.850
or there's an internal
power struggle amongst the help.

18:35.852 --> 18:37.218
Or maybe Mercer
wanted a contract

18:37.220 --> 18:38.385
that was given to Stegner.

18:38.387 --> 18:40.137
Oh. If you're right,

18:40.139 --> 18:42.389
then we need to identify
who the target is.

18:42.391 --> 18:44.024
Unless the job's
already been done.

18:44.026 --> 18:46.227
<i>Man you're looking for</i>
<i>is a ruthless,</i>

18:46.229 --> 18:48.229
<i>stone-cold contract killer.</i>

18:48.231 --> 18:50.898
I've worked organized crime
all over the country--

18:50.900 --> 18:52.233
New York, Chicago, Miami.

18:52.235 --> 18:54.068
Never seen anything like Mercer.

18:54.070 --> 18:55.536
He's a world-class house painter

18:55.538 --> 18:58.572
whose expertise is
the “White Death,”

18:58.574 --> 19:00.491
that is,
making people disappear.

19:00.493 --> 19:03.627
Mostly jurors, witnesses,
cops trying to do their job,

19:03.629 --> 19:06.297
anyone who can potentially
hurt the Bagosa family.

19:06.299 --> 19:08.115
He's rumored
to have over 100 kills,

19:08.117 --> 19:10.167
and we've never
been able to touch him.

19:10.169 --> 19:12.086
He's that good.
You just know he's been there

19:12.088 --> 19:15.840
because his victims are never
seen or heard from again.

19:15.842 --> 19:18.476
On the street,
they call him “Valentine.”

19:18.478 --> 19:20.294
- Oh, that's cute.
- Why Valentine?

19:20.296 --> 19:23.731
Because people who know him
say he doesn't have a heart.

19:24.650 --> 19:26.433
100 kills means
he has a lot of enemies.

19:26.435 --> 19:27.985
Killing Stegner
must have just put

19:27.987 --> 19:29.386
the Bagosa family
at the top of that list.

19:29.388 --> 19:31.489
Unless the hit was sanctioned,

19:31.491 --> 19:33.107
Valentine's going
to have to pay for it.

19:33.109 --> 19:34.992
All right, Agent Chapman,
what have you got

19:34.994 --> 19:36.360
on this man's
personal life?

19:36.362 --> 19:39.747
Not much. A surveillance package
was assigned to him,

19:39.749 --> 19:41.832
but the judge wouldn't
renew the request

19:41.834 --> 19:43.751
after it yielded
no suspicious activity.

19:43.753 --> 19:46.420
We do know he spent some time
at a hospital recently,

19:46.422 --> 19:48.239
following a car accident,

19:48.241 --> 19:49.707
but we can't get
the medical records.

19:49.709 --> 19:51.425
Bagosa brought in
his own team of doctors

19:51.427 --> 19:52.543
to perform the surgery.

19:52.545 --> 19:54.078
You said
the accident was recent?

19:54.080 --> 19:56.130
Yeah, two years ago.

19:56.132 --> 19:58.015
After that,
Valentine dropped off the grid,

19:58.017 --> 20:00.134
then presumably returned back
to work, never skipping a beat.

20:00.136 --> 20:01.936
And here's
what you need to know:

20:01.938 --> 20:03.971
This man's efficient.

20:03.973 --> 20:05.923
He doesn't linger,
he doesn't collect trophies.

20:05.925 --> 20:08.392
There's no ego
involved in what he does.

20:08.394 --> 20:10.344
And if he's still
on your island,

20:10.346 --> 20:12.062
you can expect some more bodies.

20:13.316 --> 20:14.982
There's too much blood.

20:14.984 --> 20:16.817
I can't even
see the bullet,

20:16.819 --> 20:18.702
let alone assess the damage.

20:18.704 --> 20:21.488
If it hit an artery, and I
extract it, you could bleed out.

20:21.490 --> 20:23.824
Let us give you
something for the pain.

20:26.078 --> 20:28.879
Do I look like someone
who cares about pain?

20:29.715 --> 20:31.832
She's trying to help.

20:31.834 --> 20:34.835
Focus.

20:35.671 --> 20:38.172
Donna, stabilize this.

20:38.174 --> 20:41.091
You want to tell me
who shot you?

20:41.093 --> 20:42.843
Maybe where it happened?

20:44.013 --> 20:46.180
Anyone you want us
to contact?

20:46.182 --> 20:49.066
Look, I can't get to the slug

20:49.068 --> 20:50.651
without a CAT
scan or an X-ray.

20:50.653 --> 20:52.770
Let us take you
to the hospital.

20:53.773 --> 20:56.190
Straub Clinic is only a
few miles down the road.

20:56.192 --> 20:58.492
We can be there
in ten minutes.

21:00.279 --> 21:02.580
Dumb move, slick.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.623
We found him.
He's on the move.

21:12.625 --> 21:15.426
HPD received a 911 call,
and they got a lock

21:15.428 --> 21:17.828
on the ambulance he stole.

21:27.056 --> 21:28.722
I got him. Hold on.

21:48.661 --> 21:50.244
Oh, no.

21:50.246 --> 21:52.029
I was hoping
he wouldn't do that.

22:08.314 --> 22:09.813
Punch it! He's getting away!

22:11.100 --> 22:12.316
I got my foot on
the floor here.

22:12.318 --> 22:13.767
Seriously?

22:13.769 --> 22:16.270
Seriously!
All right, you know what?

22:16.272 --> 22:17.821
Let's get something straight
here, Chicago. I don't like it

22:17.823 --> 22:19.940
when Danny criticizes my
driving, the same goes for you.

22:19.942 --> 22:22.242
You got it?
Would you relax your giggle hole?

22:22.244 --> 22:24.194
My what?
Listen.

22:24.196 --> 22:25.362
It's not a criticism.

22:25.364 --> 22:28.082
I think you drive fine.
I'm just saying

22:28.084 --> 22:30.584
I think the Camaro would come
in handy right about now.

22:30.586 --> 22:32.252
You don't say.

22:36.876 --> 22:38.542
<i>He's slowing down!</i>

22:44.850 --> 22:46.216
What the hell's he doing?

23:07.323 --> 23:08.655
Hands! Let me see your hands!

23:08.657 --> 23:09.990
Moving.

23:09.992 --> 23:12.326
Get out of the
vehicle right now!

23:24.306 --> 23:25.389
He's lost a lot of blood.

23:25.391 --> 23:28.559
Call an ambulance.

23:29.512 --> 23:31.895
Isn't this ironic?

23:52.896 --> 23:54.980
How you doing?

23:54.981 --> 23:58.649
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett, Five-O.

23:58.651 --> 24:00.868
This is Lieutenant Kelly,
Captain Grover.

24:02.488 --> 24:04.405
Now we know
who you are, Valentine.

24:04.407 --> 24:06.824
And we also know that you
work for Albert Bagosa.

24:06.826 --> 24:08.659
See, the thing we
can't figure out

24:08.661 --> 24:11.245
is, uh, is why you
would kill your,

24:11.247 --> 24:12.830
your associate
Joseph Stegner.

24:13.716 --> 24:16.133
Was it business
or was it personal?

24:16.135 --> 24:18.219
A little of both.

24:18.221 --> 24:20.554
Well, you could've whacked
Stegner back in Detroit,

24:20.556 --> 24:21.755
saved yourself the airfare.

24:21.757 --> 24:23.591
Why fly all the way
out here to do it?

24:23.593 --> 24:26.427
Have you ever been to Detroit
in the wintertime?

24:26.429 --> 24:28.596
Yeah.

24:28.598 --> 24:29.930
Walked right
into that one.

24:29.932 --> 24:31.899
All right, how many
more people on your list?

24:31.901 --> 24:33.651
I'm not here to kill anyone.

24:33.653 --> 24:36.270
I'm here to protect people.

24:36.272 --> 24:38.005
What people?

24:39.258 --> 24:43.010
The ones Bagosa
hid me to take out.

24:43.012 --> 24:45.829
That doesn't make any sense.

24:47.700 --> 24:48.949
So you expect us
to believe

24:48.951 --> 24:51.001
that you didn't fulfill
those contracts?

24:51.003 --> 24:53.754
If you wanted the truth,

24:53.756 --> 24:56.173
that's it.

24:56.175 --> 24:57.541
All right.

24:57.543 --> 24:59.426
Why the change of heart?

25:01.764 --> 25:03.964
Sometimes things
happen that...

25:06.269 --> 25:09.720
...change a person's
perspective on life.

25:11.140 --> 25:12.806
Well, that's...

25:12.808 --> 25:14.308
that's some deep
and soulful stuff

25:14.310 --> 25:15.859
for a man who's killed
over a hundred people.

25:24.937 --> 25:27.237
Two years ago...

25:27.239 --> 25:29.873
middle of a thunderstorm,

25:29.875 --> 25:31.992
I got into a head-on
with a moving van

25:31.994 --> 25:34.378
with bad brakes.

25:34.380 --> 25:36.497
Doctors said I suffered

25:36.499 --> 25:39.466
a traumatic ventricular

25:39.468 --> 25:42.169
failure.

25:42.171 --> 25:45.055
That there was
a 100% certainty I would die

25:45.057 --> 25:47.141
if I didn't get a new heart.

25:49.095 --> 25:52.012
Okay, how'd you get
to the top of the list?

25:52.014 --> 25:55.099
You gentlemen forget
who I work for.

25:55.101 --> 25:58.936
Man like Albert Bagosa
doesn't get wait-listed.

25:58.938 --> 26:00.437
I needed a new heart.

26:00.439 --> 26:01.689
He got me one.

26:01.691 --> 26:05.242
Not that he had
any great affection for me.

26:05.244 --> 26:07.861
He just needed me
to get back to work.

26:07.863 --> 26:11.165
I was told...

26:11.167 --> 26:14.868
that my heart belonged
to a very special young man.

26:19.342 --> 26:21.508
He taught at about

26:21.510 --> 26:23.510
the worst school in the city.

26:23.512 --> 26:26.513
Served meals
at the local soup kitchen.

26:26.515 --> 26:28.966
Built houses
for the homeless

26:28.968 --> 26:32.469
during his summer break.

26:32.471 --> 26:35.272
Then one day,
this solid citizen,

26:35.274 --> 26:38.308
this... man who lived

26:38.310 --> 26:40.894
to make a difference,

26:40.896 --> 26:44.832
got hit by a drunk driver
while crossing the street.

26:49.288 --> 26:53.340
And it was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to me.

26:57.446 --> 26:59.463
'Cause I got a piece of him.

27:03.669 --> 27:06.253
After that, things changed.

27:07.306 --> 27:09.056
<i>Went about my business</i>

27:09.058 --> 27:10.724
<i>the way I always done it.</i>

27:14.430 --> 27:17.431
<i>But when it came</i>
<i>to the moment of truth,</i>

27:17.433 --> 27:20.267
<i>couldn't go through with it.</i>

27:22.938 --> 27:25.105
<i>Just couldn't pull the trigger.</i>

27:27.109 --> 27:30.611
And it kept happening
contract after contract.

27:31.697 --> 27:34.782
Something happened
when I got that new heart.

27:36.202 --> 27:38.836
I began thinking of the people

27:38.838 --> 27:40.487
I was asked to kill.

27:40.489 --> 27:43.474
Their loved ones.

27:43.476 --> 27:46.794
Their families.

27:46.796 --> 27:50.230
What did they do to deserve me?

27:51.467 --> 27:53.133
Okay. Well, if
your story's true,

27:53.135 --> 27:55.152
that can't have made
Mr. Bagosa happy.

27:57.773 --> 27:59.973
I never told Bagosa.

27:59.975 --> 28:03.227
Every contract I got,

28:03.229 --> 28:05.028
I pretended to fill it.

28:05.030 --> 28:08.315
So, what about all the people
you're supposed to kill?

28:08.317 --> 28:11.068
What happened to them?

28:12.471 --> 28:15.072
I found a safe place
to hide them.

28:15.074 --> 28:16.373
You created

28:16.375 --> 28:18.325
your own witness
protection program.

28:18.327 --> 28:20.160
That's right.

28:20.162 --> 28:21.628
<i>An entire community</i>

28:21.630 --> 28:24.665
<i>made up of people</i>
<i>that didn't deserve to die.</i>

28:34.660 --> 28:38.662
But somehow Bagosa found out.

28:38.664 --> 28:41.098
Then how is it that you're still
walking around?

28:42.568 --> 28:45.102
I'm that good.

28:46.472 --> 28:48.272
That's why Bagosa

28:48.274 --> 28:51.508
sent Stegner to Hawaii, huh?

28:51.510 --> 28:53.777
To kill those people
that you've been hiding?

28:53.779 --> 28:56.747
Those people are innocent.

28:56.749 --> 29:00.117
I couldn't let Stegner
end their lives.

29:05.791 --> 29:08.058
- You think I'm lying?
- I think

29:08.060 --> 29:10.360
you just told
a really great campfire story.

29:10.362 --> 29:13.230
The only things missing
are the marshmallows.

29:13.232 --> 29:16.033
The only way we can know
if you're telling the truth

29:16.035 --> 29:18.802
is if you tell us
where you stashed those people.

29:23.409 --> 29:26.410
So where are they?

29:27.346 --> 29:31.915
If I tell you,
I put those people at risk.

29:31.917 --> 29:35.185
That's just not gonna happen.

29:36.055 --> 29:37.821
Boy, I have heard
some fairy tales

29:37.823 --> 29:39.022
in 30 years as a cop,

29:39.024 --> 29:40.524
but this one beats all of 'em.

29:40.526 --> 29:41.625
It's out there.

29:41.627 --> 29:43.727
But I give him points
for originality.

29:43.729 --> 29:45.229
If he made it up,

29:45.231 --> 29:46.997
it was well-rehearsed.

29:46.999 --> 29:49.733
Come on... you're not
buying this, are you?

29:49.735 --> 29:51.101
Every gun-for-hire

29:51.103 --> 29:53.570
has an exit strategy,
in case he gets pinched.

29:53.572 --> 29:56.607
This guy's story is probably
just something to distract us

29:56.609 --> 29:58.475
from what he's
really here to do.

29:58.477 --> 29:59.843
Yeah, or it's real
and he's telling the truth.

29:59.845 --> 30:02.646
We gotta dig into this.
We gotta dig into this.

30:02.648 --> 30:04.514
Let's see if Detroit
can corroborate.

30:07.186 --> 30:08.619
Lieutenant Kelly.

30:08.621 --> 30:11.688
I've been thinking
about your friend's situation.

30:11.690 --> 30:13.891
And?

30:15.961 --> 30:17.578
Maybe we can do
a little quid pro quo.

30:17.580 --> 30:20.197
That is, if my welfare
means anything to you.

30:20.199 --> 30:22.833
It doesn't.

30:22.835 --> 30:24.201
Just keep talking.

30:24.203 --> 30:26.086
Turns out some of the guys
in general pop

30:26.088 --> 30:28.121
don't like the fact
that I'm related to Five-O.

30:28.123 --> 30:29.456
Well, maybe
you should have thought of that

30:29.458 --> 30:31.124
before you killed my father.

30:31.126 --> 30:32.626
Look, what's done is done.

30:32.628 --> 30:35.462
Nothing can change that.

30:35.464 --> 30:39.266
But what can change
is your friend's situation.

30:41.887 --> 30:44.104
Tell me what you want.

30:45.474 --> 30:47.557
Immediate transfer
to the special holding unit

30:47.559 --> 30:49.026
at the high security facility.

30:49.028 --> 30:51.194
There I'll get a private cell

30:51.196 --> 30:52.779
and private rec time,
and for that,

30:52.781 --> 30:54.815
I am willing to pay
five and a half

30:54.817 --> 30:56.984
million dollars.

30:59.922 --> 31:01.622
So I was able
to track down paperwork

31:01.624 --> 31:03.323
from a surgical supply company

31:03.325 --> 31:04.992
verifying Valentine's
heart transplant.

31:04.994 --> 31:06.793
It was all paid
for by Bagosa.

31:06.795 --> 31:09.029
But there's not much more
post-surgery.

31:09.031 --> 31:11.081
Valentine said he stashed
those people somewhere,

31:11.083 --> 31:12.582
which means
he could've bought land.

31:12.584 --> 31:15.252
The problem with Valentine is
that he's in a cash business.

31:15.254 --> 31:17.220
Right?
Right. So it's unlikely

31:17.222 --> 31:19.089
he's the kind of guy
that's gonna use his real name

31:19.091 --> 31:20.340
on anything,
so there's no financials,

31:20.342 --> 31:21.892
no way to trace
any real estate transactions.

31:21.894 --> 31:23.226
Then where the hell

31:23.228 --> 31:25.429
is Valentine hiding all these
people he was supposed to kill?

31:25.431 --> 31:27.597
My assistant
said you rang.

31:27.599 --> 31:29.066
Yeah, your mom didn't sound
too happy when I called.

31:29.068 --> 31:30.484
Is everything all right?

31:30.486 --> 31:32.519
- Eh, she's got seller's remorse.
- Hey, congrats

31:32.521 --> 31:33.887
on selling your house.
Not my house.

31:33.889 --> 31:35.188
It's my mom's.

31:35.190 --> 31:37.240
Which means I'm in the market
for a new basement,

31:37.242 --> 31:38.358
if any of you
are looking for

31:38.360 --> 31:39.526
a friendly nonsmoker willing

31:39.528 --> 31:41.445
to trade light housework
for room and board.

31:44.249 --> 31:46.867
Well, if you hear
of anything then.

31:51.006 --> 31:53.040
Cool. How can I help?

31:53.042 --> 31:56.176
So, listen, if somebody wanted
to live off the grid,

31:56.178 --> 31:59.262
Jerry, and I'm talking
like Big Brother-fearing,

31:59.264 --> 32:02.015
income tax-avoiding,
way, way off the grid,

32:02.017 --> 32:04.134
- where would they go?
- We're talking no phone service,

32:04.136 --> 32:06.720
no nosey tourists, no contact
with the outside world.

32:06.722 --> 32:08.638
What they're trying
to say is where do

32:08.640 --> 32:10.357
your like-minded friends
all live?

32:10.359 --> 32:12.225
How many people we looking at?

32:12.227 --> 32:14.194
Maybe a dozen,
possibly more.

32:14.196 --> 32:15.445
Right. And it'd need
to be a place

32:15.447 --> 32:16.530
that has the
resources

32:16.532 --> 32:17.814
to sustain a
community like that

32:17.816 --> 32:19.116
for a long
period of time.

32:19.118 --> 32:20.734
So you're saying,

32:20.736 --> 32:23.537
like, if Amelia Earhart had
come to Hawaii to fake her death

32:23.539 --> 32:24.621
instead of Howland Island?

32:24.623 --> 32:26.490
Ye...
Sure, Jerry.

32:26.492 --> 32:27.741
Well, that's easy.

32:27.743 --> 32:30.077
Two places:
west coast of Molokai

32:30.079 --> 32:31.411
or the Lanai rainforest.

32:31.413 --> 32:33.830
If you wanted to disappear,
either place would work.

32:33.832 --> 32:35.382
Right.

32:37.586 --> 32:38.885
Special Agent Chapman.

32:38.887 --> 32:40.554
Any progress
on your end?

32:40.556 --> 32:42.506
I'm afraid we have
a new development, Commander.

32:42.508 --> 32:43.508
What's that?

32:43.509 --> 32:44.674
One of my most reliable C.I.s

32:44.676 --> 32:47.260
just told me a plane chartered

32:47.262 --> 32:49.012
by one
of Bagosa's front companies

32:49.014 --> 32:50.480
left Detroit four hours ago

32:50.482 --> 32:51.982
headed west
with a manifest of six.

32:51.984 --> 32:54.768
And they just lost contact
with the plane.

32:54.770 --> 32:58.555
We're pretty sure
they're avoiding radar contact.

32:58.557 --> 33:00.323
You got trouble headed your way.

33:00.325 --> 33:02.743
Six guys, a lot of muscle.

33:04.580 --> 33:06.246
They're not just
coming for Valentine.

33:06.248 --> 33:08.498
They're coming for
the people he's hiding, too.

33:08.500 --> 33:10.450
We gotta move.

33:13.455 --> 33:15.122
Listen to me very carefully--

33:15.124 --> 33:17.007
if you care about those people
that you're hiding,

33:17.009 --> 33:18.175
you need to tell us
where they are right now.

33:18.177 --> 33:20.343
What's going on?

33:20.345 --> 33:21.545
There's a plane in the air,

33:21.547 --> 33:22.813
with six guys on it--
they're coming here

33:22.815 --> 33:24.381
to finish the job your
pal Stegner couldn't.

33:24.383 --> 33:26.550
All right, so I'm gonna
say it one more time:

33:26.552 --> 33:27.884
if they mean anything to you,
anything at all,

33:27.886 --> 33:30.470
you need to give us their
location, you understand?

33:32.558 --> 33:34.391
How do I know you're not lying?

33:43.952 --> 33:46.870
You tell us where they are,
you can help us save them.

34:27.368 --> 34:28.527
They're five miles from here.

34:28.654 --> 34:30.295
In an abandoned
summer camp.

34:30.295 --> 34:31.712
I made a map for you.

34:31.714 --> 34:32.963
All right, thanks.

34:34.717 --> 34:37.217
It's all there,
just like we agreed on.

34:37.219 --> 34:39.319
Okay. Mahalo.

34:44.851 --> 34:46.099
Alright.
Let's go.

35:14.105 --> 35:16.439
Spread out.

35:28.703 --> 35:30.370
Generator is running
out of fuel.

35:30.372 --> 35:32.755
Somebody's gonna have to go
into town for supplies.

35:32.757 --> 35:37.260
I can do that tomorrow
morning before it gets too busy.

35:37.262 --> 35:40.463
I'll tell the others,
get them to make their lists.

35:40.465 --> 35:42.298
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
we're running low

35:42.300 --> 35:43.349
on some of the essentials.

35:43.351 --> 35:44.684
We're gonna need
some more batteries,

35:44.686 --> 35:47.103
and I think we're
pretty low on fishing line.

35:54.946 --> 35:56.446
It worked.

35:56.448 --> 35:57.319
Told you.

35:57.343 --> 35:59.343
Hey, how about a little love
for the maestro?

35:59.367 --> 36:00.483
Good work, Jerry.

36:00.485 --> 36:01.367
Thanks, sistah.

36:01.369 --> 36:02.936
I got movement, Jerry.

36:02.938 --> 36:05.321
One diversion, coming right up.

36:05.323 --> 36:07.707
Hey, have you seen
my pocket knife?

36:07.709 --> 36:10.994
Did you lose it again?

36:10.996 --> 36:13.846
Maybe one of the kids took it.

36:15.550 --> 36:18.217
I don't believe it--
toaster's broken again.

36:31.900 --> 36:34.734
Little help, here.

36:34.736 --> 36:36.819
Freeze!

36:43.528 --> 36:45.328
Hello, boss.

36:47.082 --> 36:49.916
Do you have any idea what
you're doing, Valentine?

36:49.918 --> 36:52.952
Asking you politely
to put down your gun.

36:55.490 --> 36:56.990
You know me
better than anyone.

36:56.992 --> 37:00.209
I'll blow your damn
head off right here.

37:14.225 --> 37:15.441
Take him away.

37:15.443 --> 37:17.777
My pleasure.

37:17.779 --> 37:19.812
I saved your life.

37:20.982 --> 37:23.900
In ways you'll never know.

37:25.737 --> 37:28.538
All right, you want
to step this way, sir?

37:28.540 --> 37:31.074
Got a nice
little cage for you.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.084
Thank you.

37:54.232 --> 37:55.848
Let's go.

38:45.734 --> 38:48.901
All right, it's all here--
five-and-a-half million.

38:48.903 --> 38:51.404
You're gonna maybe tell me
where, uh, where it came from?

38:53.124 --> 38:54.657
Anonymous donor.

38:54.659 --> 38:56.325
That donor wouldn't

38:56.327 --> 38:59.128
happen to, uh, be somebody
who's related to you, would it?

38:59.130 --> 39:00.747
He was, once.

39:00.749 --> 39:02.131
He means nothing to me now.

39:02.133 --> 39:05.251
This is gonna
cost you in ways

39:05.253 --> 39:07.954
that you could not
possibly predict.

39:07.956 --> 39:09.255
You know that, right?

39:09.257 --> 39:11.674
Why don't you let me
worry about that.

39:11.676 --> 39:13.676
You just worry about
getting your brother back.

39:15.013 --> 39:16.496
Okay.

39:16.498 --> 39:17.680
Thank you.

39:18.767 --> 39:20.850
Thank you, brother.
Yeah.

39:20.852 --> 39:22.568
I mean it.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.394
You made it
with an hour to spare.

40:40.148 --> 40:42.481
You brought a little friend,
too-- that's nice.

40:43.935 --> 40:46.269
Look, it's-it's
all there, okay?

40:46.271 --> 40:49.438
Just, uh, let me see
my brother now.

40:49.440 --> 40:50.656
Please.

40:50.658 --> 40:51.941
You're right.

40:51.943 --> 40:54.360
Deal's a deal.

41:03.254 --> 41:04.787
Matty!

41:04.789 --> 41:07.957
Matty!
It's Danny. I'm here!

41:17.385 --> 41:18.968
Do you want
to take him with you

41:18.970 --> 41:20.937
or would you prefer
that we ship him?

41:28.613 --> 41:30.613
Danny...

41:39.240 --> 41:41.073
Danny!

41:44.379 --> 41:46.746
Get up... get up!

41:48.583 --> 41:51.133
Okay, all right.
Okay, all right.

41:51.135 --> 41:53.085
All right. Listen to me.

41:53.087 --> 41:55.171
Do yourself a favor
and kill me now,

41:55.173 --> 41:56.973
'cause I promise you--
I promise you, I'm gonna

41:56.975 --> 41:59.008
put you in the ground
the first chance I get.

41:59.010 --> 42:01.510
