00:11.845 --> 00:13.680

00:13.763 --> 00:16.099
Yes! Way to take one for the team!

00:17.308 --> 00:21.771
Ay, por el amor de Dios...  it is so hot.

-Lame.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.659
[Penelope] Okay, let's eat.  Mami, comida.

00:34.743 --> 00:38.413
Okay, the rice and the  frijoles
are in the pickle jar...

00:39.622 --> 00:42.417
-and the  lechón  is in the butter tub...
-Mm-hmm.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.420
...and the cookies are in the cookie tin,

00:45.503 --> 00:48.214
but they are not the same cookies
that came with the tin.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.843
-We forgot the napkins.
-Ah!

00:51.926 --> 00:54.304
Grab some from the snack bar.
They make you buy something,

00:54.387 --> 00:56.473
so one of you needs to create
a distraction.

00:56.556 --> 00:59.726
Elena, do that thing and ask if there's
high-fructose corn syrup in the ketchup.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.353
When she's boring the guy to death,
grab the napkins and run.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.356
Or I could just buy something?

01:05.440 --> 01:06.441
[scoffs and laughs]

01:30.215 --> 01:32.425
I've been taking Spanish classes on the DL

01:32.509 --> 01:35.637
so I can be a more productive member
of the family. No offense.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.097
Why would I be offended?
You're not family.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.766
You know I hate that joke.

01:41.559 --> 01:44.062
Anyway, I always thought
I was homolingual,

01:44.145 --> 01:45.146
turns out I'm bi.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.736

01:56.407 --> 01:57.951
He thinks you're my daughter.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.745
There's something wrong
with your  ojos, hombre.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.123
That means "eyes."

02:03.206 --> 02:04.499
I know what it means.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.752
I mean, he's clearly a white guy
and I'm clearly Latinx.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.171
Okay.

02:11.089 --> 02:15.593
I'm sorry. Latinx is a gender-neutral
alternative to Latino or Latina.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.054
Okay.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.724
And I'm clearly too young
to have a 16-year-old.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.518
-Actually--
-We're both offended!

02:30.400 --> 02:34.445

your Spanish isn't exactly totes  bueno...

02:35.446 --> 02:38.241

I'm just proud of my heritage.
You know, my Cuban heritage.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.668
Okay.

04:55.837 --> 04:59.966
Dale  means "go ahead" or "you go."

05:00.550 --> 05:03.261
It's slang, so it's kind of fluid.
Very Cuban.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.575
My dad never came to my games.

06:08.201 --> 06:12.121
All he ever did was put me through rehab
six times and buy me this building.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.251
Look, all I know is,
none of the other parents act like you.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.921
Come on, it's all because
we're proud of you,  papito.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.423

06:27.178 --> 06:29.138
-We'll call you  papito.
-I will call you  papito.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.934
No. No!  Papito  is not an age thing.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.477
We call Conrad "Macho"

06:34.560 --> 06:37.230
because when he was four,
he sang "Macho Man" once.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.983
We call Francisco "Pepe Popo."
Figure that out.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.071
I'm called Tata, Lupita, Yoyi.

06:45.154 --> 06:49.075
And my nickname is Pucha.
It is the way of our people!

06:49.158 --> 06:50.993
If you don't have a nickname,
there's something wrong with you.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.079
-Do I have a nickname?
-No.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.378
Anyway, it's a tradition
to call you  papito,

07:00.461 --> 07:03.256
so we're gonna keep doing it,
okay,  papito?

07:03.339 --> 07:04.674
No! You need to stop it

07:14.600 --> 07:16.436

07:18.438 --> 07:20.440
Schnei-Schnei can still go to the games.

No, we're all still going to the games.

Don't worry.
It's so much easier after they've grown.

You do everything through the lawyers.

It's been rough.
Alex is being really hard on me.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.175
Yeah, well,
there's no easy path through it.

Although, if you want some advice...

08:32.887 --> 08:34.138
Yeah. Definitely. Anything.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.099
Whenever possible,
treat him like an adult.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.228
If he wants to be called Alex,
call him Alex.

maybe just try a cool-guy head nod.

That's okay.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.328
and I loved it so much.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.456
It was weird how often he kissed me
on the lips and asked me to marry him,

09:42.540 --> 09:44.792
but now I miss it, you know!

and Elena's amazing,

And now he doesn't want
to hang out with me anymore?

09:53.301 --> 09:57.096
I'm sorry. Next time I ask
if you want my advice, just go like...

I know his type.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.404

in my apartment...

10:14.238 --> 10:15.239
with my mom.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.578
Hey, if I'm lucky,
maybe I could take her off your hands.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.455
So I'll just be alone?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.583
I'm going to stop talking.

10:28.044 --> 10:31.005
Oh, my God. He is so cute.
Can I just smell his head for one minute?

10:31.088 --> 10:32.590
We're still at lunch. Thank you.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.969
I know I'm acting crazy. I just...

-Check your tone.

10:59.825 --> 11:00.660
What happened?

11:00.743 --> 11:03.829
His class went on a field trip
to the observatory,

11:03.913 --> 11:05.956
and he punched a kid from another school.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.625
Papito!

11:08.376 --> 11:09.460
Is your hand okay?

11:10.795 --> 11:12.838
You know, I've had enough of you
and your teen crap.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.215
I'm not raising a jerk.

11:14.298 --> 11:15.925
I'm not a jerk! The other kid's the jerk!

11:16.008 --> 11:20.262
Everyone's a jerk!
It is still not okay to punch them!

11:20.346 --> 11:22.348
Whatever. You don't understand.

11:22.431 --> 11:23.682
Well, make me understand.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.726
Because how is this okay?
Did he hit you first?

11:25.810 --> 11:26.852
He was saying stuff!

11:26.936 --> 11:28.687
Okay, so what?
So what, he called you a name?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.356
What? Stupid, dummy, goober?

11:30.439 --> 11:32.108
What grade do you think I'm in?

11:36.070 --> 11:40.574
Listen, if  papito  punched somebody,
there is a good reason for it.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.369
Did he prevent you
from seeing the Jupiter exhibit?

11:43.452 --> 11:45.037
Because that thing is amazing.

11:46.455 --> 11:47.873
Was it about a woman?

11:48.999 --> 11:51.460
It's okay if it was about a woman.

11:52.294 --> 11:53.879
No,  Mami,  it's not.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.006
He said, "Go back to Mexico!"

12:03.389 --> 12:05.933
So, this was just some random kid?

12:06.016 --> 12:08.394
Yeah. Hugo and I were talking in Spanish,

12:08.477 --> 12:11.772
and the kid walked by with his friends
and heard us and said it.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.816
And, I don't know, I just lost it.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.360
Okay.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.238
This is not okay.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.699
I'm gonna call the school
and straighten this out.

12:21.782 --> 12:25.202
There's nothing you can do.
None of the teachers even saw him say it.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.122
Then after I hit him,
Sister Barbara pulled me aside

12:28.205 --> 12:30.040
and him and his friends took off.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.543
Alex, we're gonna figure this out,

12:32.710 --> 12:35.588
but you can't hit somebody
every time they call you a name.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.381
I don't! It was just this time!

12:37.465 --> 12:40.134
-Wait, this has happened before?
-Yeah.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.177
What did they say?

12:41.802 --> 12:46.557
You know, beaner, wetback,
gangbanger, Pitbull.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.644
Pitbull's the only one
that's even close to accurate!

12:53.689 --> 12:54.732
Does this happen at school?

12:54.815 --> 12:57.485
No. Just a couple of times when I'm out.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.403
Once at a baseball game,

12:59.487 --> 13:02.198
the other team was leaving on their bus
and they saw me and yelled,

13:02.281 --> 13:03.365
"Build the wall."

13:03.449 --> 13:04.742
Oh, my God.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.868
It's so stupid!

13:06.660 --> 13:08.704
Whatever.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

13:11.665 --> 13:14.043
No,  Mami,  let's give him a minute.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.379
Well, we gotta do something.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.258
This is racist! Should we call the police?

13:21.342 --> 13:24.345
Wait, the army! No! Oprah!
She'll know what to do.

13:26.472 --> 13:30.100
Gracias  for your anger, Schneider.
It is adorable.

13:30.184 --> 13:34.188
[scoffs] I mean, what the hell?
This is America!

13:34.271 --> 13:35.773
Yeah, this is America.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.359
And unfortunately,
this stuff happens here.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.111
Not to you, but it happens.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.113
Well, I know it happens.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.784
I'm a very aware Canadian-x person.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.539
I know racism's a thing,
but we live in LA.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.540
It doesn't happen here.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.211
And now that I've said that out loud,
I wish I hadn't.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.547
Yeah, because it happens here.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.924
Yeah, maybe just a dirty look...

14:02.591 --> 14:04.134
or someone saying, "Keep your voice down,"

14:04.218 --> 14:06.804
which we all know is code for
"Latinos are too loud."

14:06.887 --> 14:08.639
It's called passion!

14:14.853 --> 14:16.021
Turn it down,  Mami.

14:18.440 --> 14:22.236
Man, I feel for Alex.
You know, I get how this stuff builds up.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.697
Finally, you say, "Not today!"

14:24.780 --> 14:27.533
But nobody saw the other 100 times
this crap happened.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.077
They just see the one time you lose it.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.413
Yeah, and ever since
somebody decided to call

14:32.496 --> 14:35.416
an entire group of Latinos
rapists and criminals,

14:35.499 --> 14:37.960
everyone thinks they can say
whatever racist thought occurs to them.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.129
So what, we're going backwards?

14:40.212 --> 14:43.924
That's it, tomorrow I'm getting on Twitter
and putting a stop to all of this.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.595
Most of it is so stupid.
People lump us all together.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.930
I mean "beaner"?
It's more of a Mexican slur.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.933
Yes! How dare they call us Mexican!

14:55.060 --> 14:56.896
Not what we're mad about,  Mami.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.483
I've been called a beaner,
and I think it's a compliment,

15:01.567 --> 15:04.361
'cause Cubans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans,
we all have pretty good beans.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.906
No, no, Cubans have the best beans.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.074
We are the true beaners!

15:10.743 --> 15:12.286
Not what we're mad about,  Mami.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.999
-Know what word makes me see red? Lazy.
-Oh...

15:17.082 --> 15:20.044
Yeah, that just brings up "siesta"
and "you people don't  want  to work hard."

15:20.127 --> 15:23.631
Yeah, I mean, either we're taking
all your jobs or we're lazy. Pick one!

15:23.714 --> 15:25.382
Thank you. By the way, get a job.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.803
[exhales] I get it.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.764
[clears throat, clicks tongue]

15:32.681 --> 15:35.225
There's a word
people sometimes call me, too.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.144
-Clueless?
-Moocher?

15:37.227 --> 15:38.854
Trust fund man-child baby?

15:41.357 --> 15:42.441
I'll say it!

15:44.151 --> 15:47.237
The word... is "white."

15:51.450 --> 15:53.869
I see it stunned you all into silence.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.288
But you hear how it sounds?

15:56.914 --> 16:00.960
It's just dripping with privileged,
rich, pale, uncool,

16:01.043 --> 16:02.795
bad dancer, Maroon Five fan...

16:02.878 --> 16:05.214
which is crazy
'cause Maroon Five is the best!

16:09.009 --> 16:12.221
Sorry. I don't know where
these stereotypes come from.

16:14.056 --> 16:20.437
Well, I have been called the worst thing
that a person could ever be called.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.190
Mami,  what was it? The A-word?

16:23.273 --> 16:25.109
-The B-word?
-[whispers] The C-word?

16:26.402 --> 16:28.278
What? No, what are those words?

16:30.280 --> 16:34.827
No, no, no, no, no. This word is so bad
that I can hardly bring myself to say it.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.245
-Okay.
-I will say it.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.124
For educational purposes...

16:41.125 --> 16:42.501
the word is...

16:44.712 --> 16:47.965
Schneider, can you stand next to me,
'cause I am going to faint.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.719
-Mami,  don't say it.
-No, no, no, I am going to say it!

16:52.428 --> 16:55.556
The most terrible word in the world!

16:55.889 --> 16:57.391
[inhales deeply] Okay.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.144
Here we go.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.063
And the word is...

17:04.481 --> 17:06.316
- Can I have a glass of--
-Mami,  just say it!

17:06.400 --> 17:07.985
Spic! [gasps]

17:08.986 --> 17:10.446
[pants]

17:13.240 --> 17:15.701
What? Did you not hear me say spic?

17:16.285 --> 17:17.786
-Yeah.
-[Schneider] We heard you.

17:17.870 --> 17:21.123
No,  Mami,  that is definitely a bad slur.
But, you know what's weird?

17:21.331 --> 17:24.376
-You don't really hear that one anymore.
-I don't think I've ever heard it.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.461
-What is it again?
-Spic.

17:25.544 --> 17:26.545
[exclaims]

17:27.671 --> 17:31.216
I'm sorry,  Mami.  That one just has
more power with your generation.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.259
Well...

17:33.802 --> 17:37.347
When it is being yelled at you
as you are walking home from school,

17:38.057 --> 17:40.893
a teenage girl
who can barely speak the language,

17:41.935 --> 17:46.982
you are thinking first, "It is a cat call.
Because of my perfect legs."

17:49.193 --> 17:52.613
But then, your friend Valentina tells you,

17:52.696 --> 17:54.865
"No, no.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.910
In fact, it is...

18:00.079 --> 18:01.205
a hate word."

18:01.997 --> 18:04.917
And then suddenly, you feel very alone.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.005
[shakily] And it stays here.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.677
-[sighs deeply]
- Mami,  I'm sorry.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.307
-Words can be very powerful.
-[sniffles]

18:21.558 --> 18:24.728
Yeah, I mean, I feel really bad for Alex.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.856
It's amazing how lucky I've been.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.068
Even these days,
in this openly racist world,

18:31.151 --> 18:32.903
I've managed to never have an incident.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.452
-What?
-No, and hopefully you never will.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.913
Yeah, but why are you being weird?

18:42.996 --> 18:44.123
I'm not being weird.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.543
All right, look... Um...

18:48.836 --> 18:52.840
you and your brother
are of different... shades.

18:52.923 --> 18:53.757
Yes.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.846
Papito  is a beautiful caramel...

19:00.722 --> 19:02.307
and you are Wonder Bread.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.479
-Am I passing?
-No!

19:08.147 --> 19:09.356
Well...

19:09.898 --> 19:11.316
What do you mean "passing"?

19:11.400 --> 19:14.111
It's when people of color
pass as Caucasian

19:14.194 --> 19:16.738
and benefit from white privilege
even though they're a minority.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.783
Well, that's a big old  sí  then,  señorita.

19:20.617 --> 19:21.660
Huh?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.997
Let me explain. [clears throat]

19:25.080 --> 19:29.042
[speaking Spanish]

19:29.626 --> 19:31.253
[speaking Spanish and chuckling]

19:31.336 --> 19:32.754
[laughs]

19:32.838 --> 19:35.340
-[in English] Where did that come from?
-Yeah!

19:35.424 --> 19:38.302
Schneider!
I didn't know you could speak Spanish!

19:38.385 --> 19:41.513
[speaking Spanish]

19:41.597 --> 19:46.143
[speaking Spanish]

19:46.226 --> 19:47.686
[speaking Spanish]

19:47.769 --> 19:48.979
[in English] Stop it!

19:50.814 --> 19:56.069
This is terrible!
I can't be passing! I am a proud Latinx!

19:56.153 --> 19:57.821
What the hell is a Latinx?

20:00.532 --> 20:03.744
Is it a Cuban Kleenex?
If so, then it is the best Kleenex!

20:05.287 --> 20:09.416
I mean, who even decides
what Latinx looks like? I look Latinx!

20:09.499 --> 20:11.376
Of course you do! You're beautiful!

20:11.460 --> 20:13.545
I always thought you looked like
Anne Hathaway.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.005
No, no, no!

20:16.506 --> 20:19.718
Why are you so mad? Cubans are white.

20:19.801 --> 20:20.802
[groans]

20:22.554 --> 20:25.390
Mami,  Cubans are everything.

20:25.474 --> 20:29.144
But we are mostly descended
from white Spaniards.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.896
How many Cubans do we know who are black?

20:30.979 --> 20:33.565
And how many Cubans
do we know who are blond? [laughs]

20:33.649 --> 20:35.275
[whispers] A lot of them.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.196
Saying we're white, brown, black,
that's beside the point.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.864
Exactly.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.699
[whispers] We are white.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.702
I can't believe this.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.372
You're saying I'm going to go through
my whole life

20:48.455 --> 20:50.040
without being oppressed at all?

20:54.336 --> 20:57.297
Okay, you know that wouldn't be
a bad thing, right?

20:58.340 --> 20:59.383
Yeah, I guess.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.802
Hey, you're still gay.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.017
Yes! That's right!

21:09.643 --> 21:11.687
And a woman! I'm back in!

21:14.815 --> 21:17.109
Oppression is not the goal here, okay?

21:17.192 --> 21:18.944
We want peace, equality...

21:19.778 --> 21:21.613
and most of all, no crappy kid

21:21.697 --> 21:24.366
yelling racist stuff at my son
while he's trying to learn about stars.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.204
Someone told Alex
to go back to another country,

21:29.288 --> 21:30.622
as though he doesn't belong in this one.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.375
Do you know how screwed up that is
for a 13-year-old boy?

21:36.128 --> 21:37.796
I don't even know what to tell him.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.507
Oh...

21:42.301 --> 21:43.135
[sighs]

21:44.094 --> 21:46.847
-I want to learn more Spanish.
-I'll set up a lesson plan.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.557
Not from you!

21:50.642 --> 21:51.935
Will you teach me,  Abuelita?

21:52.602 --> 21:54.146
Gracias a Dios.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.772
I knew this day would come.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.566
Oh, wait, can you teach me, too?

21:57.649 --> 22:02.988
Of course! And when I am done,
you both can pass as Cubans.

22:03.071 --> 22:05.032
-Yay!
-Hey!

22:13.373 --> 22:14.583
Hey, you.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.088
I'm sorry I hit that kid.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.594
I know.
And I'm sorry all this stuff is happening.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.182
I just want to go back to the way it was.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.684
It's like...

22:34.186 --> 22:35.771
all of a sudden I'm different?

22:36.313 --> 22:38.065
I don't want to be different.

22:40.734 --> 22:41.568
Wait...

22:43.612 --> 22:45.739
is that why you don't want us
to come to the games?

22:50.452 --> 22:54.122
So it's not because we're crazy
and treat you like a baby?

22:54.748 --> 22:56.083
Well, I don't love that.

22:59.294 --> 23:05.133
But, mostly it's because...
we're too Cuban, right?

23:06.760 --> 23:10.222
I mean, I'm proud of being Cuban,
but... yeah.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.726
-Sorry.
-[chuckles] It's okay.

23:15.852 --> 23:16.812
I get it.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.526
And look, I wish I could say
what happened to you today

23:22.609 --> 23:24.611
will never happen again, but it might.

23:26.863 --> 23:30.742
'Cause there are a lot of jerks out there,
and I don't know if it's worse now or not,

23:30.826 --> 23:34.287
but I know I would never want you
to change who you are because of them.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.083
And who you are is Cuban...

23:38.667 --> 23:40.168
and American...

23:42.003 --> 23:44.381
and mostly a sweet kid
who doesn't hurt people.

23:47.676 --> 23:51.763
You can't control the jerks
but you can control your reaction to them.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.809
Because this is your country, too,
and you deserve to be happy in it.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.229
But if you get angry, they win.

24:00.397 --> 24:01.356
Okay.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.532
[sniffles]

24:13.869 --> 24:15.328
[sniffs]

24:20.250 --> 24:23.003
Actually, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

24:24.588 --> 24:30.010
There is one thing that completely stops
the effects of racism.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.390
-You're right, Mom. I feel only peace.
-[chuckles]

24:36.266 --> 24:39.644
Alex, you have something on your chin.
You need a Latinx.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.151
Elena, what did you get? Vanilla?

24:46.234 --> 24:47.319
No!

24:51.364 --> 24:53.533
But I was able to do
my whole order in Spanish!

24:53.617 --> 24:55.118
-Hey! Nice.
-Hey!

24:55.202 --> 24:58.872
Dale, blanquita, dale.  Ah-ah-ah.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.625
[all]  Dale, blanquita, dale.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.294
-No! Don't call me  blanquita!
-Hey, you've got a nickname!

25:04.377 --> 25:07.005
Oh, yeah! [laughs]

25:07.088 --> 25:11.176
-[all]  Dale, blanquita, dale!
-[exclaims]

25:11.259 --> 25:14.179
-Dale, blanquita, dale!
-Excuse me!

25:14.262 --> 25:16.264
I know you're having
a little  fiesta  over here,

25:16.348 --> 25:18.308
but you should learn
to keep your voice down.

25:18.391 --> 25:19.684
There are other people in here.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.775
Mami,  would you hold my  helado,  please.

25:33.156 --> 25:34.157
Hi.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.868
I'm the lady from the table over there.

25:36.952 --> 25:39.955
And I am the lady's mother.
Not her sister.

25:41.581 --> 25:45.085
Question. Are you the owner
of this establishment?

25:45.168 --> 25:46.503
-No.
-So then you must know

25:46.586 --> 25:48.588
that we have just as much a right
to be here as you.

25:48.672 --> 25:49.798
You were being very loud.

25:49.881 --> 25:53.260
Yeah, I noticed you used the word  fiesta.
Would you care to comment on that?

25:53.343 --> 25:56.179
-Poor choice of words maybe but--
-Yes, I agree. Yeah.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.431
It was a very poor choice of words.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.642
You know what else
was a poor choice of words?

26:00.725 --> 26:02.560
The other words you said
to me and my family.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.313
Because this isn't a library.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.691
We were over there having a nice time,
but for some reason,

26:07.774 --> 26:12.445
you decided that meant I was all,
"Arriba! Arriba! Arriba!"

26:13.446 --> 26:14.406
That's not me.

26:14.990 --> 26:18.493
How dare you stereotype us!

26:21.413 --> 26:25.250
I was born right here, in this country.
I'm an American.

26:25.333 --> 26:26.251
Cuban-American.

26:26.334 --> 26:28.962
And we come in all shapes,
sizes and colors.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.088
Mostly white.

26:32.048 --> 26:34.301
And sometimes we can be
a little racist, too.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.177
Which is why we should all be free

26:36.261 --> 26:39.180
to enjoy the rich diversity
of this great nation.

26:41.182 --> 26:43.184
Now you and your wife have a good night.

26:45.312 --> 26:46.771
Still think you should
keep your voice down.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.189
That's all I'm saying.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.191
Yeah, well, agree to disagree, sir!

26:53.987 --> 26:55.905
-That was awesome, Mom.
-[exhales deeply]

26:55.989 --> 26:58.783
You see, if you get angry, they win.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.996
If you never get angry, they also win.
It's complicated.

27:03.079 --> 27:07.250
The point is, I didn't hit anybody,
and we all got ice cream.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.420
All right, let's get out of here.

27:10.503 --> 27:13.673
Dale, Lupita, dale.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.926
[all]  Dale, Lupita, dale.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.595
-[Penelope] Thank you.
-[Lydia whoops]

27:18.678 --> 27:21.139
[all]  Dale, Lupita, dale.

27:21.222 --> 27:24.309
And in case anybody else
wants to know what's up?

27:24.392 --> 27:27.896
This Latin-American family is headed
to their American home.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.564
That is so cool.

27:29.647 --> 27:32.692
Anne Hathaway just totally stood up
for those Mexicans.
