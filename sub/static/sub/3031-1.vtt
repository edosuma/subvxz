02:47.272 --> 02:48.705
Zeus.

02:53.812 --> 02:55.439
Poseidon.

02:55.980 --> 02:57.607
lt's been many years.

03:01.586 --> 03:03.417
What do you see?

03:07.592 --> 03:09.082
Thunderclouds.

03:11.429 --> 03:13.226
But no lightning.

03:16.167 --> 03:17.725
Stolen.

03:20.839 --> 03:23.569
What? You think l took it?

03:24.509 --> 03:27.535
Omnipotence has blinded you, brother.

03:27.645 --> 03:30.307
We are forbidden
from stealing each other's powers.

03:32.083 --> 03:36.645
-But our children aren't.
-You're accusing my son?

03:38.323 --> 03:41.087
l haven't seen him since he was a baby.
He doesn't know me

03:41.192 --> 03:45.151
-or even know who he is because of you.
-lf your son is the thief,

03:46.331 --> 03:48.629
l will send him to the depths of Tartarus.

03:49.701 --> 03:54.001
lf you touch him,
you will have the fight of your life.

03:58.176 --> 04:02.738
He must return the bolt to me in 14 days,

04:02.847 --> 04:05.247
by midnight on the summer solstice,

04:12.457 --> 04:14.254
or there will be war.

05:54.209 --> 05:56.234
And he's alive!

05:59.047 --> 06:03.643
Percy Jackson is a beast!
You're a beast, man! Give me some.

06:05.187 --> 06:07.246
-How long was that?
-Seven minutes.

06:07.355 --> 06:08.813
Seven minutes?

06:09.691 --> 06:12.751
That's crazy, man. That's ridiculous.
How do you do it?

06:12.861 --> 06:14.658
l just like being in water.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.990
lt's the one place l can think.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.880
l wish l could spend all day underwater
instead of this place.

06:34.015 --> 06:37.280
Right. lt's like high school
without the musical.

06:37.986 --> 06:40.682
Every day it's the same thing. Look at this.

06:49.064 --> 06:53.558
Good morning. l'm Mrs. Dodds,
your substitute English teacher.

06:54.402 --> 06:55.630
Would someone please explain

06:55.737 --> 06:59.833
what Shakespeare was trying to convey
in this line from <i>Othello?</i>

07:02.878 --> 07:04.368
Percy Jackson?

07:09.217 --> 07:10.343
Well?

07:19.027 --> 07:21.018
l'm sorry, l don't know.

07:22.631 --> 07:24.098
Anybody else?

07:44.419 --> 07:47.877
-Hey, Mom, l'm home!
-l'm up here, honey!

07:49.891 --> 07:51.222
-Hi.
-Hey, Mom.

07:51.326 --> 07:53.920
-How was school today?
-The usual.

07:54.996 --> 07:59.262
l think this dyslexia thing is getting worse.

07:59.401 --> 08:01.460
Why do you think that?

08:02.837 --> 08:05.965
l don't know. Maybe it's the ADHD.

08:07.676 --> 08:10.804
You know, l thought this school
was supposed to make things better.

08:10.946 --> 08:13.710
Percy, l know how hard this is for you.

08:14.249 --> 08:17.150
-But someday it'll all make sense.
-Really?

08:18.420 --> 08:19.546
When?

08:20.989 --> 08:22.980
Tonight? Tomorrow? When?

08:24.693 --> 08:25.887
Woman!

08:27.195 --> 08:28.560
Hi, Gabe.

08:29.297 --> 08:31.128
Where's my beer?

08:31.266 --> 08:32.995
-lt's in the fridge.
-So, what,

08:33.134 --> 08:37.332
it's supposed to magically float
from the icebox and into my hand?

08:38.673 --> 08:39.900
Hustle.

08:40.842 --> 08:43.140
Come on, man.
You have to do that right here?

08:43.278 --> 08:45.838
lt's disgusting. We're in a kitchen.

08:48.183 --> 08:50.947
Yeah, real charmer you got there. Really.

08:51.052 --> 08:54.681
Show some respect, all right?
That's my mom right there.

09:03.398 --> 09:04.865
This is my house.

09:07.002 --> 09:08.867
You show some respect.

09:09.404 --> 09:10.837
Come on.

09:13.008 --> 09:16.500
Why do you stay with that pig?
He smells like a sewer.

09:16.645 --> 09:19.512
He sleeps till noon every day
and he can't even hold a job.

09:19.648 --> 09:21.673
Why do you stay with him?

09:24.319 --> 09:28.050
He's been good to us, Percy,
in ways you don't understand.

09:29.424 --> 09:32.689
You're right. l don't understand.
l don't get it.

10:00.388 --> 10:05.189
<i>Be prepared.</i>
<i>Everything is about to change, Percy.</i>

10:05.694 --> 10:08.492
<i>Everything is about to change.</i>

10:17.706 --> 10:19.833
There are 12 Olympian gods.

10:21.042 --> 10:25.706
The big three are the brothers
Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.

10:26.448 --> 10:31.181
They attained power by overthrowing
their father, Kronos,

10:32.120 --> 10:34.520
chopping him into little pieces.

10:35.890 --> 10:38.791
The three gods have been rivals
ever since,

10:39.427 --> 10:43.227
always arguing, always threatening war.

10:44.499 --> 10:48.458
On several occasions,
they would come down to Earth and.. .

10:50.004 --> 10:52.404
-How shall l put this?
-Hook up?

10:54.642 --> 10:57.133
They would hook up with mortals.

10:57.278 --> 11:01.647
The children of these unions
were half god, half human.

11:02.817 --> 11:05.752
Can anyone tell me what they were called?

11:05.854 --> 11:07.048
Percy.

11:07.689 --> 11:08.883
Percy.

11:10.258 --> 11:12.954
l'm sorry. What? What, Mr. Brunner?

11:14.329 --> 11:18.891
What is the proper name
of the offspring of a human and a god?

11:21.536 --> 11:23.561
-Demigod.
-Exactly.

11:24.372 --> 11:26.636
And many became great heroes,

11:27.509 --> 11:29.977
like Hercules and Achilles.

11:30.645 --> 11:34.137
Can you name another?

11:37.118 --> 11:39.279
l'll give you a hint.

11:39.387 --> 11:41.651
You have something in common.

11:51.866 --> 11:53.128
Percy.. .

11:55.503 --> 11:56.765
Perseus?

11:59.741 --> 12:01.003
Correct.

12:03.211 --> 12:08.012
Now, over here, we have a depiction
of Hercules defeating the Nemean lion.

12:09.350 --> 12:12.717
Hercules killed the beast
with his bare hands

12:12.854 --> 12:14.981
and took the skin as a trophy.

12:15.824 --> 12:16.848
Percy?

12:17.892 --> 12:19.154
Yes, Mrs. Dodds?

12:19.761 --> 12:21.023
We need to talk.

12:22.931 --> 12:24.057
Okay.

12:24.599 --> 12:28.330
The next 1 1 labors
would become increasingly difficult.

12:28.436 --> 12:31.166
lt would take Hercules three months.. .

12:39.180 --> 12:41.410
So, did l do something wrong?

12:43.551 --> 12:44.916
Mrs. Dodds?

12:45.854 --> 12:47.014
Hello?

12:48.056 --> 12:49.489
Where is it?

12:50.792 --> 12:54.523
Hey! Hey. How did you get up there?

13:03.938 --> 13:07.396
-You stole the lightning bolt!
-l don't know what you're talking about!

13:07.542 --> 13:09.271
Give it to me!

13:10.578 --> 13:13.706
Give it to me! Now!

13:13.815 --> 13:16.409
Or l will bite your heart out!

13:16.551 --> 13:17.882
Percy!

13:19.087 --> 13:21.681
-Release him !
-You!

13:21.789 --> 13:25.885
Release him
or l swear l'll tear you to pieces!

13:38.306 --> 13:41.366
l'm going crazy! l should be on medication.

13:41.476 --> 13:43.307
Percy, calm down, okay?
Everything's gonna be okay!

13:43.444 --> 13:48.472
Oh, God, wait! Did that really just happen?

13:48.616 --> 13:49.913
She just turned into that thing?

13:50.018 --> 13:54.387
A Fury concealed in our school.
l should have known.

13:54.489 --> 13:57.117
Wait, a Fury? What's a Fury?

13:57.258 --> 13:59.624
And why did you say
you could tear her to pieces?

13:59.761 --> 14:04.255
-What did she want from you?
-She said something

14:05.199 --> 14:08.327
about me stealing a lightning bolt.

14:09.871 --> 14:11.429
They found him.

14:14.542 --> 14:17.170
-He's in danger.
-Who found me?

14:17.312 --> 14:19.143
-He's no longer secure here.
-Where should we move him?

14:19.280 --> 14:21.271
We have no choice. The Camp.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.407
What camp? Look, l'm standing right here.

14:23.518 --> 14:25.247
lf they think he's the thief,

14:25.353 --> 14:27.480
there's nowhere safe on heaven and Earth
for him now.

14:27.622 --> 14:31.183
Percy, take this to defend yourself.

14:31.326 --> 14:35.023
lt's a powerful weapon. Guard it well.

14:35.163 --> 14:38.621
Only use it in times of severe distress.

14:40.535 --> 14:43.470
This is a pen. This is a pen!

14:43.571 --> 14:46.597
Take him to his mother,
and don't let him out of your sight.

14:46.708 --> 14:49.768
Okay. Percy, come on. Come on, man.
Come on!

14:49.877 --> 14:51.003
-Are you guys crazy?
-Let's go!

14:51.145 --> 14:52.635
This is a pen, man.

14:52.747 --> 14:55.011
-What do you want me to do with this?
-Come on!

14:55.483 --> 14:57.974
-Look, man, what's going on?
-Look,

14:58.086 --> 15:01.522
don't trust anyone, okay?
Don't look at anybody, just keep walking!

15:01.623 --> 15:04.091
Why did Mr. Brunner
ask you to watch me?

15:04.225 --> 15:05.817
-Because l'm your protector.
-Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

15:05.927 --> 15:08.327
My protector? Are you kidding?

15:08.429 --> 15:11.330
What, you think because l'm like this,
l'm not capable of keeping you safe?

15:11.432 --> 15:14.492
Maybe you're not seeing what l'm seeing.
You have crutches!

15:14.602 --> 15:16.570
Look, l would give my life
to secure your well-being.

15:16.704 --> 15:18.604
What are you talking about?
What's going on?

15:18.740 --> 15:21.766
We got to warn your mom.
Come on, Perce.

15:21.909 --> 15:23.171
Come on!

15:24.479 --> 15:27.004
-Sally! More beer!
-Mom !

15:27.749 --> 15:30.582
Hey, Mom. Mom ! Mom !
Look, we gotta talk, okay?

15:30.718 --> 15:32.117
Hey!

15:32.253 --> 15:34.517
Can't you see she's servicing
me and my friends?

15:34.622 --> 15:38.285
Hey. Hey! Don't talk about my mom
like that, you bald-headed freak.

15:38.426 --> 15:40.018
No, Gabe! Gabe!

15:40.128 --> 15:41.561
Calm down!

15:45.967 --> 15:49.232
-Hey, nice one.
-Like l said, l'm your protector.

15:50.104 --> 15:51.230
Yeah.

15:51.939 --> 15:55.306
Sally, Percy has to leave now.
Like, right now.

15:55.743 --> 15:56.869
Okay.

16:02.517 --> 16:06.476
Look, what is happening?
Okay, l swear, l didn't steal anything!

16:06.621 --> 16:09.215
Honey, l believe you. l believe you.

16:10.425 --> 16:12.256
Where are you taking me?
What is this camp?

16:12.360 --> 16:15.124
lt's a camp for really special people,

16:15.263 --> 16:16.992
-like you.
-''Special people''?

16:17.131 --> 16:21.568
-What, am l crazy or something?
-No, honey, no.

16:22.470 --> 16:24.495
Percy, this is about your father.

16:29.177 --> 16:31.475
l was just out of school
and working at the Jersey shore

16:31.612 --> 16:33.307
when we first met.

16:35.717 --> 16:40.245
Your father was unlike any guy
l'd ever seen. He was just dazzling.

16:41.189 --> 16:42.850
They're always dazzling.

16:42.990 --> 16:45.288
We were really in love, Percy.

16:46.461 --> 16:49.988
And then you came along,
and then it was just perfect.

16:50.498 --> 16:52.295
But he had to leave.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.358
So he did abandon us.

16:56.003 --> 16:59.029
No, honey, he was forced to. He loved you.

17:00.074 --> 17:04.306
Leaving you, it was probably
the most difficult thing he ever did.

17:15.056 --> 17:16.990
Why did he have to go?

17:18.092 --> 17:20.117
-Because he's.. .
-Sally, watch out!

17:20.928 --> 17:22.896
Mom ! Go straight!

17:30.705 --> 17:32.696
-Percy?
-Mom, you all right?

17:32.840 --> 17:35.365
-Yeah, yeah.
-Grover, you all right?

17:37.178 --> 17:39.578
ls it me or is it raining cows?

17:44.018 --> 17:45.576
What is that?

17:45.720 --> 17:49.156
Get out! Come on! Come on!

17:49.257 --> 17:51.521
Why are you taking your pants off?
What are you doing?

17:51.626 --> 17:52.854
My job!

17:53.761 --> 17:56.491
-You're half donkey?
-l'm half goat.

18:02.103 --> 18:03.695
Go, Grover!

18:03.805 --> 18:05.568
Guys, watch out, there's glass!

18:06.641 --> 18:09.405
Come on, get out of the car!
That thing's getting closer!

18:09.544 --> 18:12.513
-You don't even need these.
-Look, man, those are just for show.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.274
Follow me!

18:18.586 --> 18:24.855
This way, guys! This way!
Come on! Come on! Come on, run! Run!

18:39.173 --> 18:40.868
Come on! Come on!

18:45.413 --> 18:46.971
We're here!

18:57.992 --> 19:00.825
-Mom ! What are you doing?
-This is as far as l can go.

19:00.962 --> 19:04.227
-Come on!
-l can't go through! l'm not like you!

19:04.365 --> 19:07.801
-Look, l'm not leaving without you.
-You have to!

19:07.935 --> 19:09.232
You're meant to!

19:16.377 --> 19:18.174
Put my mother down!

19:18.312 --> 19:21.076
Percy, go! You're safe inside the gate!

19:21.182 --> 19:22.979
-What can l do?
-Listen, use the pen!

19:23.117 --> 19:25.312
-What?
-Use Brunner's pen and click it!

19:49.243 --> 19:50.870
Perce, are you okay?

20:02.590 --> 20:04.455
Percy, behind you!

20:18.773 --> 20:20.866
-Perce, you okay?
-l'm not feeling.. .

20:21.008 --> 20:22.236
Percy!

20:49.036 --> 20:51.698
Perce, l'm sure glad you're alive.

21:05.152 --> 21:09.020
-Where am l? What is this place?
-The infirmary.

21:09.123 --> 21:12.581
-You've been unconscious for three days.
-Three days?

21:13.494 --> 21:17.055
So, Perce, what do you remember?

21:18.766 --> 21:24.762
Some crazy dream. l don't know.
There was a monster. My mom was there.

21:24.905 --> 21:30.070
You were there, too, but you were
some weird hybrid man-goat thing!

21:33.347 --> 21:36.407
Yeah. The politically correct term is Satyr.

21:37.518 --> 21:38.576
No.

21:39.420 --> 21:42.253
No, no, no, no!

21:42.923 --> 21:46.086
All of it was real? My mom's gone?

21:48.095 --> 21:50.996
l'm sorry, Percy. l try, man, l really do.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.492
But, frankly, l'm just a junior protector.
l don't have my horns yet.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.932
lt was my fault.
lt was my job to protect you.

22:01.942 --> 22:03.341
Both of you.

22:13.788 --> 22:17.121
So this is Camp Half Blood.

22:17.658 --> 22:20.456
-''Half'' meaning what?
-l think you know.

22:20.561 --> 22:22.358
''Half'' meaning ''half mortal, half god."

22:22.496 --> 22:25.829
-Fire!
-Guys! Watch the arrows!

22:25.966 --> 22:27.957
Newcomer! Hello!

22:29.203 --> 22:33.162
Look, man, remember all the myths
about Greek gods and goddesses?

22:33.307 --> 22:37.300
Well, they're not myths.
Look, remember what Mr. Brunner said?

22:37.411 --> 22:40.209
Sometimes they come down to Earth
and they fall in love with mortals?

22:40.347 --> 22:42.338
And then they have kids?

22:43.150 --> 22:45.141
-No way.
-Yes way.

22:46.020 --> 22:50.389
Yep, you're a demigod!
Two points for Percy Jackson!

22:52.026 --> 22:55.154
Look, don't worry. But you're not alone.
There's hundreds in the world.

22:55.262 --> 22:56.786
Some lead normal lives,

22:56.897 --> 22:59.798
and some, l'm not allowed to divulge
their names, are very famous.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.334
l'm talking about,
like, White House famous.

23:03.337 --> 23:04.804
See, man, this place right here,

23:04.905 --> 23:07.066
this is the place where you'll learn
to harness your powers.

23:07.208 --> 23:11.008
You'll train to become leaders,
warriors and heroes.

23:11.112 --> 23:14.479
l think you have the wrong guy, all right?
l'm not a hero.

23:14.582 --> 23:17.642
l'm a loser. l have dyslexia, ADHD.

23:17.751 --> 23:19.878
And those are your greatest gifts.

23:20.521 --> 23:23.149
When you try to read,
the words float off the page, right?

23:23.257 --> 23:26.556
That's because your brain is hardwired
for Ancient Greek, not English.

23:26.694 --> 23:29.390
Like at the museum, l could read.

23:29.530 --> 23:31.725
Yeah. And your ADHD?

23:33.801 --> 23:37.396
You're impulsive, Percy. You can't be still!

23:37.538 --> 23:40.063
Those are your natural
battle reflexes, man.

23:40.207 --> 23:42.539
They kept you alive in your fight.

23:42.643 --> 23:46.010
Look, no pitiful loser can defeat
a Minotaur.

23:47.214 --> 23:49.079
Your blood is special.

23:49.550 --> 23:51.108
lt's the blood of a god.

23:52.286 --> 23:54.584
This is a lot to process.

23:54.722 --> 23:56.883
Yeah, a lot. A lot.

24:00.961 --> 24:04.055
This is where you'll do
most of your battle training.

24:18.412 --> 24:19.811
What's her name?

24:21.982 --> 24:25.611
-She will squash you like a bug.
-Her name.

24:25.753 --> 24:29.154
Annabeth. Daughter of Athena,
the goddess of wisdom.

24:34.361 --> 24:37.922
Hey, no staring. Keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Come on.

24:41.569 --> 24:44.595
There's someone l want you to see.
Check this out.

24:58.819 --> 25:00.548
What are those things?

25:00.688 --> 25:02.053
They're Centaurs.

25:04.191 --> 25:07.627
-Wait a minute. ls that Mr. Brunner?
-Come on.

25:15.102 --> 25:16.899
Mr. Brunner?

25:17.037 --> 25:20.234
ln my world, l'm known as Chiron.

25:21.508 --> 25:24.306
-Are you recovered?
-Am l recovered?

25:24.411 --> 25:28.074
You, you're not in a wheelchair. You have.. .

25:29.216 --> 25:31.047
A real horse's ass.

25:31.785 --> 25:33.548
l apologize for hiding my true form,

25:33.687 --> 25:37.589
but l needed to keep an eye on you.
l hope you'll forgive me.

25:38.292 --> 25:39.418
Come.

25:53.307 --> 25:54.740
Hey, Grover!

25:57.745 --> 25:59.736
The daughters of Aphrodite.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.747
Okay. All right, guys.
You guys got a lot of catching up to do.

26:02.883 --> 26:05.716
Their mother is the goddess of love,
so you know where that leads.

26:05.819 --> 26:07.047
Hey, baby!

26:08.455 --> 26:09.683
Satyrs.

26:12.726 --> 26:14.193
What is this place?

26:15.329 --> 26:16.956
Welcome home.

26:17.097 --> 26:19.861
Your father built this for you.

26:32.112 --> 26:34.137
This whole place is mine?

26:49.630 --> 26:51.723
This thing's got some weight to it.

26:58.138 --> 27:00.299
My father is Poseidon!

27:00.441 --> 27:02.068
God of the seas.

27:02.710 --> 27:04.940
Why didn't anybody tell me?

27:05.045 --> 27:07.172
lt was for your own safety.

27:08.615 --> 27:12.984
lt's exceedingly rare for a child
to be born to one of the big three.

27:15.456 --> 27:17.287
You're very powerful.

27:17.891 --> 27:19.415
A threat.

27:19.526 --> 27:21.858
A threat? Who am l threatening?

27:23.397 --> 27:27.527
Poseidon's brothers, Zeus and Hades.

27:29.903 --> 27:32.770
That's why your mother married
your stepfather.

27:32.873 --> 27:36.206
His pungent odor masked
the smell of your blood

27:45.018 --> 27:47.782
My mother put up with that creep
to protect me?

27:52.493 --> 27:54.154
l wish l'd known.

27:54.995 --> 27:57.293
She sacrificed so much for me.

28:01.335 --> 28:02.859
Now she's gone.

28:10.611 --> 28:12.010
Why am l even here?

28:12.112 --> 28:14.672
You're here because you're in jeopardy.

28:14.782 --> 28:17.376
Everyone thinks you're the lightning thief.

28:17.518 --> 28:19.509
Look, l didn't steal it.

28:23.957 --> 28:27.393
Zeus' bolt is the most powerful weapon
ever created.

28:28.629 --> 28:31.530
And if it's not returned
by the summer solstice, in 10 days,

28:31.632 --> 28:34.863
-there will be a war.
-This is your problem, all right? Not mine.

28:34.968 --> 28:38.904
-This is about your world, not mine.
-This is about all worlds!

28:40.541 --> 28:42.441
Olympians would be forced
to choose sides.

28:42.576 --> 28:44.339
Earth would become a battleground.

28:44.445 --> 28:47.676
Mountains erupted, earthquakes,
raging fires!

28:48.582 --> 28:50.914
The end of life as you know it.

28:56.890 --> 28:58.448
What can we do?

28:58.592 --> 29:02.619
l want to take you to Olympus,
convince Zeus of your innocence.

29:03.464 --> 29:06.024
Someone's using you to start a war.

29:08.101 --> 29:09.932
What are we doing here? Let's go now.

29:10.070 --> 29:13.528
Your boldness is commendable,
but outside those gates

29:14.575 --> 29:17.135
you would be in danger at all times.

29:17.911 --> 29:21.210
The Fury and the Minotaur were
only the beginning.

29:21.748 --> 29:25.309
First, we must train.

29:31.458 --> 29:33.983
This is always a fun game to watch.

29:34.862 --> 29:37.330
God, how do you guys wear this stuff?
lt weighs more than me.

29:37.464 --> 29:39.728
Look, trust me. Wear it or you'll get killed.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.664
Wait. What? What? Wait.. .

29:41.802 --> 29:45.898
Heroes! Warriors!

29:46.006 --> 29:47.268
Fall in!

29:53.180 --> 29:55.239
Hustle, hustle!

29:55.349 --> 29:58.443
Dylan, Paris, stop lollygagging!

30:00.187 --> 30:02.985
Percy. Step forward.

30:07.127 --> 30:10.858
This is Percy Jackson!

30:12.399 --> 30:14.697
And he's going to need a team.

30:15.302 --> 30:16.826
We'll take him.

30:20.874 --> 30:24.173
l'm Luke. Son of Hermes and camp leader.

30:24.811 --> 30:26.938
Not necessarily in that order.

30:27.047 --> 30:28.844
Where's your helmet?

30:29.082 --> 30:30.845
No one gave me one.

30:32.719 --> 30:36.712
Chiron, you still got your wheelchair?
Kid's gonna need it.

30:36.857 --> 30:38.654
You're a goner, man.

30:39.693 --> 30:43.129
l'm messing with you.
Smile a little bit. lt's good for you, kid.

30:43.230 --> 30:46.358
Anybody got an extra helmet?
Please pass it up.

30:50.504 --> 30:51.835
Try it on.

30:52.839 --> 30:55.569
That'll protect you. So will all of us.

30:56.209 --> 30:58.643
Welcome to the Blue Soldiers, my friend.

30:58.745 --> 31:02.681
All right! Everyone in position
for Capture the Flag!

31:02.783 --> 31:06.082
First team to capture
the enemy's banner wins.

31:07.054 --> 31:08.385
Dismissed!

31:09.890 --> 31:12.586
Steady, steady!

31:13.060 --> 31:14.152
Now!

31:32.913 --> 31:35.108
Percy, l know where the flag's at.
Come on!

31:39.987 --> 31:42.717
Keep your eyes open. Don't get killed.

31:57.170 --> 31:59.934
l'm coming, buddy, l'm coming!
Sons of Ares. Watch out!

32:00.073 --> 32:02.200
Whoa, that's a sword! That's a sword!

32:05.779 --> 32:08.373
You guys take camp way too seriously.

32:09.282 --> 32:10.476
Go!

32:23.296 --> 32:26.823
Percy, get out of here! Go look for the flag!

32:26.967 --> 32:28.935
How did l just do that?

32:48.221 --> 32:49.279
No.

33:00.801 --> 33:01.961
l won.

33:04.938 --> 33:07.236
Did you really think it would be that easy?

33:12.279 --> 33:15.339
My mother is goddess of wisdom
and battle strategy.

33:15.982 --> 33:18.314
Do you know what that means?

33:18.452 --> 33:20.352
l always win.

33:21.188 --> 33:24.521
l always lose. Maybe we're both wrong.

33:43.677 --> 33:45.338
Okay, Chiron, shouldn't we get in there
and stop them?

33:45.479 --> 33:47.947
-She's killing him, man.
-You've got to be kidding.

33:48.048 --> 33:49.640
This is the best part!

33:56.923 --> 33:58.686
Stand up and fight,

34:00.660 --> 34:01.854
hero.

34:16.743 --> 34:18.335
Come on, Perce. Come on, Perce.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.212
<i>Go to the water.</i>

34:35.695 --> 34:37.993
<i>The water will give you power.</i>

37:03.310 --> 37:04.902
Yeah, Perce!

37:24.431 --> 37:27.559
-Get up there.
-All right! Yeah!

37:28.001 --> 37:29.366
Excuse me! Excuse me!

37:29.469 --> 37:32.370
Ladies and gentlemen,
the son of Poseidon is coming through.

37:32.472 --> 37:37.239
A hero is coming through! Move it!
Hey, no dirty looks. Stop that.

37:37.344 --> 37:40.074
-Sorry, l'm trying.. .
-Hey, Percy?

37:40.180 --> 37:42.478
We're having a party at our place later.

37:42.615 --> 37:44.446
And we would really love it if you came.

37:44.584 --> 37:45.915
l'd love to come. That'd be great.

37:46.019 --> 37:47.452
-That would be amazing!
-Awesome.

37:47.587 --> 37:51.751
l would love to come, too, to the party.
You know? Thanks for inviting me, ladies.

37:51.858 --> 37:53.416
Beat it, nymphs.

37:53.526 --> 37:56.495
Wait, don't leave. Ladies.. . l'm available.

37:57.197 --> 38:00.564
Wait, come on, don't leave.
l'm available! What time's the party?

38:00.667 --> 38:03.795
-Feeling like a hero?
-More like a mutant.

38:03.937 --> 38:06.804
l'm not gonna grow a fish tail or gills
or anything like that, am l?

38:06.940 --> 38:08.305
Not likely.

38:08.942 --> 38:11.604
Although a huge ego
isn't out of the question.

38:14.848 --> 38:17.009
You know you could have killed me
out there?

38:17.150 --> 38:19.448
l could have died, if l was normal.

38:19.552 --> 38:21.110
But you aren't.

38:22.222 --> 38:24.918
l get the sense
that you don't like me very much.

38:25.025 --> 38:28.586
lt's possible.
l mean, our parents hate each other.

38:28.695 --> 38:29.957
Wait. They do?

38:31.398 --> 38:33.923
l definitely have strong feelings for you.

38:35.068 --> 38:38.128
l just haven't decided
if they're positive or negative yet.

38:39.339 --> 38:42.365
Well, you let me know
when you figure it out.

38:43.543 --> 38:45.340
You'll be the first.

39:06.266 --> 39:08.826
Percy Jackson, show yourself!

39:28.688 --> 39:31.350
Hades! Stay back!

39:33.426 --> 39:37.328
Percy Jackson, bring me the bolt!

39:40.733 --> 39:42.598
Be a good boy.

39:42.735 --> 39:47.104
Hand it to me
and l will exchange it for your mother.

39:48.441 --> 39:51.342
Percy! Don't listen, Percy!

39:54.881 --> 39:56.746
My mother's gone!

39:57.951 --> 40:01.614
No, your mother is still alive.

40:01.754 --> 40:04.689
l sent the Minotaur to abduct her.

40:04.791 --> 40:07.589
She is here with me in the Underworld.

40:14.567 --> 40:15.591
Mom?

40:16.569 --> 40:17.797
Percy?

40:24.177 --> 40:25.769
What have you done with my mother?

40:25.912 --> 40:30.212
lf you ever want to see your mother again,
you will bring me the bolt!

40:36.689 --> 40:41.126
-Chiron, l have to go get her.
-Percy, you don't have the bolt.

40:41.261 --> 40:42.785
Look, l'll tell him the truth!

40:42.929 --> 40:45.955
When he realizes l'm not the thief,
he'll release her.

40:46.099 --> 40:51.594
No. You cannot negotiate with Hades.
When he finds out you don't have the bolt,

40:52.372 --> 40:54.169
he'll kill you and your mother.

40:54.307 --> 40:56.741
-This is her only chance.
-No.

40:57.477 --> 40:59.172
Stick to our plan.

40:59.779 --> 41:03.476
Travel to Olympus, bargain with Zeus.

41:03.850 --> 41:05.442
Once you convince him of your innocence,

41:05.552 --> 41:09.488
we will do everything in our power
to bring back your mother.

41:11.991 --> 41:13.117
Okay.

41:30.143 --> 41:31.804
Going somewhere?

41:32.745 --> 41:34.770
Yeah. Yeah, l'm going for a walk.

41:34.881 --> 41:37.873
-For a walk? l'm coming with you.
-No, no, l'm going alone.

41:38.017 --> 41:40.008
-No, l'm coming with you.
-No!

41:40.153 --> 41:42.018
You're being followed.

41:45.725 --> 41:47.488
-You're stressing me out.
-Leave me alone.

41:47.594 --> 41:48.720
We got a 1 :00 demigod curfew, okay?

41:48.828 --> 41:50.728
Leave me alone. Go to sleep or something.

41:50.863 --> 41:51.955
No.

41:52.699 --> 41:53.996
-Come on.
-One small victory

41:54.100 --> 41:55.158
and you're ready to fight Hades?

41:55.268 --> 41:57.361
-Double team.
-Really? You, too?

41:57.503 --> 42:01.496
Look, l just found out my mother
is still alive. l'm gonna get her back.

42:01.608 --> 42:03.872
-From the Underworld?
-Whatever it takes.

42:04.010 --> 42:05.534
Yeah, well, maybe you'll outsmart Hades.

42:05.678 --> 42:06.975
-Maybe l will.
-Look, man,

42:07.080 --> 42:08.206
l can't let you do this, okay?

42:08.348 --> 42:11.408
Look, l'm not asking for your permission.

42:11.551 --> 42:16.545
Okay. Well, according to regulations,
if l can't stop you, l must accompany you,

42:16.689 --> 42:19.089
'cause l'm your best friend
and your protector.

42:19.225 --> 42:20.385
Junior protector.

42:21.728 --> 42:22.922
ls that really necessary?

42:23.062 --> 42:26.429
l don't need your help. Okay?
This is something l have to do on my own.

42:26.566 --> 42:28.534
Yeah, well,
we weren't asking for your permission.

42:28.635 --> 42:31.604
Come on, all right?
Today you tried to kill me.

42:31.738 --> 42:34.332
-Now you want to defend me?
-That wasn't real.

42:34.440 --> 42:36.237
-That was just training.
-Yeah.

42:36.376 --> 42:39.777
Percy, that's all l've ever done,
is train and train and train.

42:39.912 --> 42:43.507
l've grown up here. l've only been
in the outside world a couple of times.

42:43.616 --> 42:46.676
And l've never had the chance
to go on an actual quest.

42:46.786 --> 42:50.779
Besides, you've won one battle
and l've won hundreds.

42:51.257 --> 42:54.351
-You're gonna need my experience.
-Good point.

42:56.562 --> 42:58.530
You two really want to come?

42:58.631 --> 43:00.030
-Yes!
-Yeah!

43:00.933 --> 43:03.401
Okay. l guess we're all going.

43:03.503 --> 43:06.404
So who knows
how to get to the Underworld?

43:07.774 --> 43:09.969
l did not think of that one.

43:11.577 --> 43:13.477
l think l know someone who might.

43:14.747 --> 43:16.772
<i>Friendly Harriers inbound!</i>

43:20.520 --> 43:21.646
Luke?

43:23.856 --> 43:25.414
Hey, guys.

43:26.192 --> 43:29.719
Percy. l figured you'd stop by
sooner or later.

43:29.829 --> 43:33.731
Everybody does,
just to get away from all that

43:33.833 --> 43:36.893
Renaissance fair stuff out there, you know?

43:38.304 --> 43:42.968
But welcome to the modern world.

43:44.310 --> 43:45.937
Cool. New stuff.

43:49.215 --> 43:53.242
-What are you guys up to?
-We're going to get my mom back.

43:54.987 --> 43:57.148
Your dad is the messenger of the gods,

43:57.290 --> 44:01.124
one of the only ones who's
gotten in and out of the Underworld.

44:01.227 --> 44:03.024
Do you have any idea how?

44:04.731 --> 44:07.291
My dad's a jerk. l've never met him.

44:07.400 --> 44:10.528
-You, too?
-Guess we all got Daddy issues, huh?

44:11.537 --> 44:14.802
That's because all gods are the same.
Selfish.

44:14.907 --> 44:17.307
They only care about themselves.

44:18.378 --> 44:22.144
But l once broke into my dad's house.
Got some cool stuff.

44:34.527 --> 44:35.824
For you.

44:47.039 --> 44:48.700
Flying shoes?

44:51.077 --> 44:52.567
They're my dad's.

44:53.379 --> 44:56.041
He has hundreds of these little guys.

44:58.751 --> 45:00.343
He won't even miss them.

45:01.053 --> 45:02.850
Look underneath the other one.

45:07.427 --> 45:09.725
You see, people have gone
to the Underworld before

45:09.862 --> 45:11.352
without having to be dead.

45:11.464 --> 45:14.695
Hercules did it. Orpheus did it.
My dad does it all the time.

45:14.801 --> 45:18.669
Getting in's the easy part.
Getting out, now that's tricky.

45:19.906 --> 45:22.272
This is a map to Persephone's pearls.

45:22.408 --> 45:25.343
Persephone? You mean Hades' wife?

45:25.445 --> 45:28.903
Yeah, he forced her to marry him.
Keeps her prisoner.

45:29.048 --> 45:32.848
Needless to say, she hates it there.
lt's hot, he's a weirdo.

45:32.952 --> 45:36.217
So she has secret visitors.

45:38.624 --> 45:40.751
She keeps pearls hidden for them
all over the world,

45:40.893 --> 45:44.124
and these pearls, they provide
a quick escape from the Underworld.

45:44.997 --> 45:46.726
You could use them to get out.

45:46.833 --> 45:49.927
-So, how do the pearls work?
-Easy.

45:50.069 --> 45:52.799
You take a pearl, you step on it,
you crush it,

45:52.939 --> 45:54.964
visualize where you want to be taken.

45:55.107 --> 45:57.075
Right now, there's three pearls
in the United States.

45:57.176 --> 46:00.873
This map will guide you there.
Right here is your first location.

46:03.349 --> 46:05.647
''Auntie Em's Garden Emporium."

46:06.018 --> 46:08.885
Once you find the first pearl,
the map will show you the next one,

46:08.988 --> 46:11.548
and the next one,
and then you're off to Hades.

46:12.158 --> 46:15.218
Which reminds me. You guys

46:16.362 --> 46:18.830
might need some extra protection, so.. .

46:21.934 --> 46:25.495
My favorite shield.
You might want to take a step back.

46:36.015 --> 46:39.314
-Hey. Thanks, Luke.
-Don't mention it.

46:39.485 --> 46:42.943
But you're gonna have to promise me
one thing.

46:43.856 --> 46:46.017
lf you see my dad on the highway to hell.. .

46:46.158 --> 46:47.284
Yeah?

46:47.393 --> 46:48.553
Kick his ass for me.

47:19.358 --> 47:22.555
This place definitely needs
an extreme makeover.

47:27.199 --> 47:28.359
Hello!

47:30.703 --> 47:34.002
Hello? Anybody home in Auntieville?

47:35.041 --> 47:37.475
Check this out. They got free sodas.

47:41.914 --> 47:43.677
Okay. That's nasty.

47:44.250 --> 47:47.310
The Health Department needs
to give this place an F.

47:50.623 --> 47:53.057
Hey, guys, check this out.

48:02.368 --> 48:03.665
Look at this.

48:05.304 --> 48:06.430
Nice.

48:07.607 --> 48:11.065
-Gold drachmas.
-That means we're on the right track.

48:11.777 --> 48:12.937
Here.

48:14.213 --> 48:16.010
How are we gonna find the pearl
in this place?

48:16.115 --> 48:17.548
That's a good question.

48:18.417 --> 48:20.544
Okay, let's split up. Check everything.

48:20.653 --> 48:21.745
-Good idea.
-Yeah.

48:21.887 --> 48:23.252
l'm gonna go this way.

48:27.893 --> 48:29.053
Hello?

48:45.344 --> 48:48.313
-Get out! She's coming!
-What? Who?

48:48.447 --> 48:52.349
We stopped.. . Directions.. .
My poor husband! Help me!

48:52.485 --> 48:53.850
Please, help me!

49:04.196 --> 49:07.757
Check this out.
He looks just like my Uncle Ferdinand.

49:09.869 --> 49:11.336
That's crazy.

49:12.071 --> 49:14.437
He got the mole in the same place.

49:15.675 --> 49:20.271
No. lt's not my Uncle Ferdinand,
because Uncle Ferdinand was killed by

49:21.580 --> 49:22.808
Medusa.

49:24.750 --> 49:27.480
Percy! Annabeth!

49:27.586 --> 49:29.850
-We're in trouble!
-Grover?

49:33.726 --> 49:36.354
Please! We have to leave
before she finds us!

49:36.495 --> 49:38.861
-Who?
-She's turned my husband to stone!

49:38.998 --> 49:40.863
Grover! Where are you?

49:42.101 --> 49:45.229
Percy! Annabeth!

49:46.405 --> 49:48.999
-Annabeth, where are you?
-Grover!

49:52.778 --> 49:55.872
-Come on, man, watch where you're going!
-Perce! Listen.

49:56.015 --> 49:58.142
-Where are we?
-We're in Medusa's lair.

49:59.085 --> 50:00.484
-Annabeth!
-Annie!

50:00.586 --> 50:02.884
We're lost! We'll never leave!

50:03.656 --> 50:04.816
Don't move.

50:09.028 --> 50:12.657
Well, this is a fabulous surprise.

50:13.299 --> 50:18.327
lt's so heartening
to have such young visitors.

50:19.538 --> 50:21.403
We get so lonely here.

50:22.942 --> 50:24.239
Don't we?

50:25.745 --> 50:29.272
That's why l create my statues.

50:31.617 --> 50:33.608
They're my only company,

50:36.255 --> 50:38.086
daughter of Athena.

50:38.224 --> 50:43.355
-How do you know me?
-You have such beautiful hair.

50:45.064 --> 50:48.056
l once had hair like that.

50:49.468 --> 50:50.958
l was courted,

50:52.605 --> 50:55.403
desired by many suitors.

50:56.776 --> 50:58.937
But that all changed

51:00.412 --> 51:02.380
because of your mother,

51:03.182 --> 51:05.446
the woman who cursed me.

51:06.752 --> 51:08.379
Who turned me.. .

51:11.190 --> 51:14.091
-Don't look!
-.. .into this!

51:16.428 --> 51:19.955
They say the eyes are
windows to the soul.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.492
l hope you find my eyes

51:27.439 --> 51:28.963
attractive.

51:31.110 --> 51:35.809
So rude, not looking people in the eyes.

51:37.783 --> 51:39.250
Come on.

51:40.386 --> 51:44.288
Sneak a peek.

52:03.909 --> 52:05.706
How are we supposed to fight something
we can't look at?

52:05.845 --> 52:08.143
We can look at a reflection.

52:08.247 --> 52:10.477
Okay, wait. Check this out.

52:10.583 --> 52:13.211
All right. Good idea.
l'm gonna go get Annabeth.

52:13.352 --> 52:15.616
-Okay, l'm gonna take care of Medusa.
-Okay.

52:15.721 --> 52:19.817
You'll make a wonderful
addition to my collection.

52:20.759 --> 52:23.353
We'll be friends forever.

52:23.929 --> 52:25.362
Do you mind?

52:29.268 --> 52:30.360
No, no.

52:34.607 --> 52:40.978
Sooner or later you will open those eyes.

52:42.748 --> 52:48.209
The temptation to look at me is
too hard to resist.

52:48.587 --> 52:50.885
Don't look, Annabeth!
Don't open your eyes!

52:52.892 --> 52:54.416
Who's that?

52:55.361 --> 52:57.056
Another demigod?

53:06.238 --> 53:07.933
l can sense you.

53:28.827 --> 53:30.522
Son of Poseidon.

53:32.831 --> 53:35.459
l used to date your daddy.

53:47.813 --> 53:51.146
-Need a hand?
-Grover. Help.

53:53.485 --> 53:55.953
-Thanks. Okay.
-Come on. Let's go.

54:03.462 --> 54:06.625
l hear you have the lightning bolt.

54:07.166 --> 54:08.963
May l see it?

54:09.635 --> 54:11.262
l don't have it!

54:13.839 --> 54:17.070
Let me see your eyes.

54:17.176 --> 54:20.976
l hear they're bluer
than the Circassian Sea.

54:22.181 --> 54:24.012
Open them,

54:24.149 --> 54:29.587
or my hungry babies
will have to open them for you.

54:32.391 --> 54:35.451
But it would be such a pity

54:35.561 --> 54:40.760
to destroy
such a young and handsome face.

54:43.335 --> 54:46.930
Stay with me, Percy.

54:47.473 --> 54:52.433
All you have to do is look.

55:09.995 --> 55:11.326
Are you okay?

55:14.400 --> 55:15.958
Yeah, l'm okay.

55:22.274 --> 55:24.868
Son of Poseidon!

55:39.124 --> 55:40.682
Heads up.

55:44.797 --> 55:47.925
Hey, guys! lt's cool to open up your eyes!

55:48.967 --> 55:54.269
Annabeth, that was
great, great demigod driving.

55:54.406 --> 55:55.737
Thanks.

55:58.911 --> 56:02.176
-We should take it with us.
-The head? Oh, no. That's sick.

56:02.281 --> 56:05.910
lf you open the eyes, they still work,
dead or alive.

56:06.051 --> 56:08.076
You never know when something like that
might come in handy.

56:08.220 --> 56:10.279
Yeah, you're right. But l'm not touching it.

56:10.422 --> 56:14.358
Come on, man, just take off your jacket.
We'll wrap it up until we get some ice.

56:14.460 --> 56:16.519
Why do l got to take off my jacket?

56:16.628 --> 56:18.391
Because you're the protector.

56:19.131 --> 56:21.031
Yeah, you're right. l am the protector.

56:21.133 --> 56:24.796
So l'm gonna give you my hoodie,
not my jacket. Okay?

56:25.571 --> 56:27.300
Come on, you baby.

56:29.741 --> 56:30.935
Disgusting.

56:31.076 --> 56:33.909
Yeah, just toss it up. Come on, don't.. .

56:34.480 --> 56:37.540
Hey. Hey. Guys, wait.

56:38.584 --> 56:40.074
The pearl.

56:45.591 --> 56:47.388
One down, two to go.

56:49.995 --> 56:53.260
Would have been nice
if Luke had warned us about Medusa.

56:53.365 --> 56:55.799
Maybe he just didn't know.

56:55.934 --> 56:58.425
GPS from the gods. Where to next?

56:59.605 --> 57:01.004
Let's see.

57:06.812 --> 57:08.473
The Parthenon in Nashville.

57:08.614 --> 57:13.313
Nashville? Oh, great.
Home of my least favorite music.

57:35.807 --> 57:36.831
-Let's stop for the night!
-Yeah.

57:36.975 --> 57:38.636
-Let's stop for the night!
-Yeah.

57:39.378 --> 57:41.437
-Good idea.
-Oh, my God.

58:00.199 --> 58:01.359
Percy.

58:18.850 --> 58:19.908
Hey.

58:24.456 --> 58:28.483
-Hey.
-Nice work today. Thanks.

58:30.929 --> 58:32.521
What happened to you?

58:34.266 --> 58:37.565
That poor lady who turned to stone, she.. .

58:37.703 --> 58:39.534
She had a tight grip.

58:41.607 --> 58:43.165
Check this out.

58:56.088 --> 58:59.057
Cool. Very cool.

59:01.627 --> 59:02.753
So,

59:03.996 --> 59:05.861
why do our parents hate each other?

59:05.964 --> 59:08.933
They both wanted to be
patron god of Athens.

59:09.468 --> 59:12.631
And the people chose Athena.

59:13.405 --> 59:16.636
And our parents have hated each other
ever since.

59:17.643 --> 59:20.476
-What's your mom like?
-l don't know.

59:20.612 --> 59:26.209
-l never met her.
-What? ls it like this for everybody?

59:26.318 --> 59:30.152
-Don't any gods see their kids?
-lt's forbidden.

59:31.256 --> 59:33.383
Right after we were born, Zeus decreed

59:33.492 --> 59:37.553
that the gods couldn't have physical
contact with their mortal offspring.

59:37.663 --> 59:41.099
-That's a stupid law.
-l agree.

59:42.934 --> 59:46.597
Although, between us,

59:48.440 --> 59:51.637
l think my mother
speaks to me sometimes.

59:51.777 --> 59:54.439
ln times of trouble, l hear her voice

59:54.546 --> 59:57.481
-giving me advice.
-That's happened to me!

59:57.616 --> 01:00:00.449
Yeah. That's your father talking to you.

01:00:01.853 --> 01:00:04.913
Yo, Percy! Get in here, man! This is ugly!

01:00:07.225 --> 01:00:08.419
Right.

01:00:09.027 --> 01:00:10.517
Hey, hurry up!

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:13.461
Perce, check this out, man.

01:00:14.299 --> 01:00:15.425
You're on TV.

01:00:15.534 --> 01:00:17.832
<i>...surrounding the missing boy,</i>
<i>Percy Jackson,</i>

01:00:17.969 --> 01:00:19.869
<i>and his mother, Sally Ugliano.</i>

01:00:20.005 --> 01:00:23.031
<i>But their relatives have</i>
<i>some interesting theories.</i>

01:00:23.175 --> 01:00:25.769
<i>So, Mr. Ugliano, talk to me</i>
<i>about your son, Percy Jackson.</i>

01:00:25.877 --> 01:00:30.712
<i>No, he's not my son. He's a stepson.</i>
<i>He did not come from these loins.</i>

01:00:30.849 --> 01:00:33.317
<i>Ever since he started with the drugs</i>
<i>and the alcohol,</i>

01:00:33.418 --> 01:00:34.612
<i>-he's never been the same.</i>
-Oh, no.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.689
<i>Five nights ago, he tried to kill me</i>
<i>and he threw his mother on the ground.</i>

01:00:37.823 --> 01:00:42.522
<i>And his cripple friend then attacked me</i>
<i>from behind and knocked me out.</i>

01:00:42.661 --> 01:00:46.688
<i>When l woke up, Sally was gone.</i>
<i>She was kidnapped by Percy.</i>

01:00:46.832 --> 01:00:48.959
<i>-She would never leave with that...</i>
-Shut up, Gabe.

01:00:49.067 --> 01:00:51.797
Great. Now l'm a fugitive.

01:00:51.903 --> 01:00:55.805
See? That's what l'm talking about, man.
Gabe's always running his mouth.

01:00:55.907 --> 01:00:58.808
He's just mad because
l busted him up with my crutches.

01:01:00.679 --> 01:01:01.805
Guys,

01:01:03.281 --> 01:01:05.749
l can't pee with her watching me.

01:01:18.096 --> 01:01:22.192
Sorry, guys. l messed up.
l should have closed the curtains.

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:26.168
Come on, guys. Let's hit the road
before Homeland Security shows up.

01:02:02.274 --> 01:02:03.798
That's amazing.

01:02:04.009 --> 01:02:06.944
A complete replica of the Parthenon
in Nashville.

01:02:07.078 --> 01:02:09.273
All right, guys. Let's go get the pearl.

01:02:33.438 --> 01:02:35.770
Hey. That's your mom.

01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:39.573
l wonder if she really looks like that.

01:02:43.114 --> 01:02:44.638
We'll find out.

01:02:47.986 --> 01:02:52.252
Guys, check this out. Oh, man.

01:02:54.659 --> 01:02:55.921
lt's the pearl.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.128
-That was easy.
-Easy?

01:03:04.236 --> 01:03:07.763
lt's 30 feet in the air
and this place is filled with tourists.

01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:11.331
l got an idea.

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:14.845
We'll come back after the place closes.
Come on, follow me.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.312
Or l can just throw my crutch up there.

01:03:17.415 --> 01:03:18.939
-l'm saying, the pearl would fall out.. .
-Grover!

01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:21.883
Perce, l'm saying.. . lt's not a bad idea !

01:03:36.201 --> 01:03:39.398
The park's been closed for an hour.
Let's move.

01:03:39.538 --> 01:03:40.835
Yes, sir!

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.969
-All right, this will be easy.
-Okay.

01:03:44.075 --> 01:03:46.407
l'm gonna fly up.
l'm gonna use Luke's flying shoes.

01:03:46.545 --> 01:03:49.070
-l'm gonna grab the pearl, and.. .
-Cool.

01:03:56.521 --> 01:03:58.989
Okay, so what are we going to do?

01:04:00.392 --> 01:04:02.019
All right, guys.

01:04:03.461 --> 01:04:04.519

01:04:04.629 --> 01:04:06.927
You got what? Hey, yo, hey, listen!

01:04:07.065 --> 01:04:09.192
-You're going to kill the janitors?
-Chill.

01:04:09.301 --> 01:04:11.326
Those are working-class Americans!

01:04:17.242 --> 01:04:18.368
Oh, man.

01:04:26.384 --> 01:04:29.182
-Why did you do that?
-They're not dead, they're unconscious.

01:04:29.287 --> 01:04:31.915
-Now, we have 30 minutes. Come on!
-Cool.

01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:47.768
-Y'all, what's cracking?
-Hey.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.967
-Luke!
<i>-Annabeth!</i>

01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:52.736
How do you turn on the shoes?

01:04:52.844 --> 01:04:54.903
<i>Tell Percy he's got to</i>
<i>break into a run, okay?</i>

01:04:55.013 --> 01:04:59.814
<i>He's got to build up speed,</i>
<i>kind of like a jet on a runway.</i>

01:04:59.951 --> 01:05:01.942
<i>lt's gonna take some practice.</i>

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.446
Okay.

01:05:04.422 --> 01:05:05.787

01:05:07.859 --> 01:05:10.225
lt's gonna take some practice!

01:05:40.692 --> 01:05:41.784

-Yes!

01:05:41.893 --> 01:05:43.520
-Yeah, Percy!
-There we go!

01:05:48.366 --> 01:05:50.334
-There it is.
-Yeah!

01:05:50.969 --> 01:05:52.937
-That's what l'm talking about.
-Way to go.

01:05:53.038 --> 01:05:55.506
All right, let's grab everything.. .

01:05:58.143 --> 01:05:59.371
Oh, man.

01:06:05.817 --> 01:06:07.284
Look, l got this, okay?

01:06:07.385 --> 01:06:10.013
Hey, guys,
l'm with Park Recreational Services.

01:06:10.155 --> 01:06:12.521
You guys have been caught
sleeping on the job. You better be happy

01:06:12.657 --> 01:06:14.682
l'm not writing you guys up, okay?
This is the last time.

01:06:14.826 --> 01:06:17.556
We've been expecting you, Mr. Jackson.

01:06:18.496 --> 01:06:19.827
Not again.

01:06:19.998 --> 01:06:23.195
Just give us the lightning bolt
and we'll let you go.

01:06:23.334 --> 01:06:26.030
Look, l don't have the lightning bolt.

01:06:27.238 --> 01:06:29.331
Okay. This is bad.

01:06:48.293 --> 01:06:49.760
Hydra !

01:06:49.894 --> 01:06:52.988
Guys, watch out!
The middle one spews fire!

01:07:17.956 --> 01:07:21.790
You got a sweet tooth? All right! Try that!

01:07:39.944 --> 01:07:43.243
Percy, stop! No!

01:07:56.361 --> 01:07:58.659
How flipping awesome was that?
l just killed that thing!

01:07:58.797 --> 01:08:01.129
Killed it? You only made it worse.

01:08:01.266 --> 01:08:04.758
-What are you talking about?
-Percy, when you cut off one Hydra head,

01:08:04.869 --> 01:08:06.393
two more grow back.

01:08:14.312 --> 01:08:15.779
Get back!

01:08:18.483 --> 01:08:20.644
Distract that thing! l'll get the pearl!

01:09:29.386 --> 01:09:30.854
Let's go!

01:09:30.955 --> 01:09:32.752
Let's go! Come on!

01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:36.520
Go! Open the door!

01:09:36.627 --> 01:09:38.390
The door won't open!

01:09:39.063 --> 01:09:40.256
Grover!

01:10:18.036 --> 01:10:19.594
That's nasty.

01:10:22.874 --> 01:10:25.240
<i>We interrupt</i>
<i>our regularly scheduled programming</i>

01:10:25.343 --> 01:10:27.334
<i>for this special report.</i>

01:10:27.478 --> 01:10:29.969
<i>Scientists are baffled</i>
<i>by what now appears to be</i>

01:10:30.114 --> 01:10:34.278
<i>a single storm cloud that is expanding</i>
<i>over much of Europe and Asia,</i>

01:10:34.385 --> 01:10:36.353
<i>moving towards the United States.</i>

01:10:36.487 --> 01:10:40.446
<i>Savage winds, rain and mammoth waves</i>
<i>are being reported along the coastlines</i>

01:10:40.558 --> 01:10:41.923
<i>of several continents.</i>

01:10:42.026 --> 01:10:46.690
<i>So far, no casualties, but countries</i>
<i>everywhere are preparing for the worst.</i>

01:10:46.831 --> 01:10:48.594
The gods are angry.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.664
We need to get the last pearl.
Where's the next location?

01:10:51.803 --> 01:10:52.929
Yeah.

01:10:53.838 --> 01:10:55.465
Well, let's see.

01:10:56.908 --> 01:10:59.877
Well, guys, we got ourselves a good one.

01:11:00.712 --> 01:11:02.179
We're going to Vegas!

01:11:30.341 --> 01:11:31.365
Yo!

01:11:38.916 --> 01:11:40.543
There it is.

01:11:41.052 --> 01:11:42.417
Lotus Casino.

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:01.561
l've been looking forward to this!
Look, guys,

01:12:01.706 --> 01:12:04.334
remember, always split the eights,
never the tens, okay?

01:12:04.442 --> 01:12:06.000
We're not here to gamble, remember?

01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:10.672
-We got poker, we got blackjack.. .
-Grover, we're not here to have fun.

01:12:10.782 --> 01:12:12.374
We just need to
grab the pearl and go, okay?

01:12:12.483 --> 01:12:13.711
All right.

01:12:16.888 --> 01:12:18.583
This is nice!

01:12:35.106 --> 01:12:37.939
Okay, this place is officially dope.

01:12:38.076 --> 01:12:39.976
Here's your complimentary
Lotus Fun Book.

01:12:40.111 --> 01:12:41.874
Thanks, but we're not staying.

01:12:41.979 --> 01:12:45.142
Please, l insist. lt's good for
everything in the hotel and casino.

01:12:45.283 --> 01:12:47.808
Don't comp us. We're not checking in.

01:12:47.952 --> 01:12:50.921
-Okay, that guy was persistent.
-Yeah!

01:12:52.090 --> 01:12:55.548
Yeah, we're here for one thing
and one thing only.

01:12:56.427 --> 01:12:58.418
That is really awesome.

01:13:00.932 --> 01:13:04.129
Where would we find a green pearl
in this place?

01:13:05.369 --> 01:13:07.633
Maybe on a cocktail waitress
or a showgirl.

01:13:07.772 --> 01:13:09.399
We should start there.

01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:16.906
Can l get you something?
Try a lotus flower. They're so good.

01:13:17.014 --> 01:13:20.848
-lt's our signature dish.
-Really? Signature?

01:13:21.819 --> 01:13:23.184
ls it good?

01:13:24.188 --> 01:13:27.157
-Thank you.
-Yo, do we have to pay for this?

01:13:28.126 --> 01:13:30.356
-l guess we don't.
-lt's free.

01:13:34.165 --> 01:13:35.928
That's really good.

01:13:41.539 --> 01:13:44.975
This is the most delicious thing
l've ever consumed!

01:14:06.764 --> 01:14:08.493
Guys, why don't we stay here for a while?

01:14:08.599 --> 01:14:11.864
-Yeah!
-That sounds like an amazing idea.

01:14:14.205 --> 01:14:18.369
But we're on a
time-sensitive mission right now.

01:14:20.511 --> 01:14:23.071
-Aren't we.. .
-l can't remember.

01:14:23.214 --> 01:14:25.307
l totally forgot what l was gonna say.

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:29.083
l think l figured it out.
l think l know why we're here.

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.586
-Why are we here?
-To have fun.

01:14:32.456 --> 01:14:34.754
Okay. Let's never leave!

-Thanks.
-Thank you! Thanks.

01:15:38.356 --> 01:15:41.450
<i>No, Percy. Don't eat the flower.</i>

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:46.421
<i>lt dulls the senses,</i>
<i>keeps you prisoner here.</i>

01:15:48.266 --> 01:15:50.097
Hey, l think l'm gonna go get some air.
l'll be right back.

01:15:50.201 --> 01:15:51.463
Okay.

<i>Look around you. Focus. Focus!</i>

01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:08.518
-Another lotus flower?
-No, thank you.

01:16:10.354 --> 01:16:13.084
-Would you like another one?
-l'm fine.

01:16:19.563 --> 01:16:23.329
<i>-The French Connection?</i>
-Yeah. You seen it yet?

01:16:24.468 --> 01:16:26.800
Yeah, yeah, l think so, on DVD.

01:16:27.505 --> 01:16:28.972
What's DVD?

01:16:30.641 --> 01:16:31.972
Seriously?

01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:35.110
Whatever.
l think it's the best movie of the year.

01:16:35.212 --> 01:16:38.113
What? Wait. This year?

01:16:39.417 --> 01:16:42.511
Yeah, this year. 1971 .

01:16:49.994 --> 01:16:51.655
<i>Percy, wake up.</i>

01:16:52.697 --> 01:16:54.392
<i>You need to escape.</i>

01:16:54.532 --> 01:16:56.557
<i>-Wake up!</i>
-You could really use a lotus flower.

01:16:56.701 --> 01:16:57.861
l really don't want one.

01:16:58.002 --> 01:16:59.026
-Thank you.
-Just one.

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:00.364
No!

01:17:15.353 --> 01:17:16.513
Another lotus flower?

01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:17.644
-No.
-We insist.

01:17:17.755 --> 01:17:20.383
l really don't want another lotus flower,
so please, leave me alone.

01:17:20.524 --> 01:17:22.685
ls there a problem, Mr. Jackson?

01:17:24.729 --> 01:17:26.697
No. Thank you.

01:17:32.269 --> 01:17:34.203
Percy Jackson's awake.

01:17:38.242 --> 01:17:39.834
Excuse me. Annabeth. Annabeth!

01:17:39.944 --> 01:17:41.377
What're you doing with that?
Don't eat that.

01:17:41.479 --> 01:17:42.605
-What?
-We have to go. Now.

01:17:42.747 --> 01:17:43.941
What do you mean?
We're having so much fun!

01:17:44.081 --> 01:17:47.107
No, no, no, we're not having fun.
Grover! Grover! Wake up!

01:17:47.251 --> 01:17:49.116
Grover! Come on, we got to go!

01:17:49.253 --> 01:17:52.120
What? Look, Perce,
your timing is terrible, okay?

01:17:52.256 --> 01:17:55.248
Dude, we're heading to the chapel.
We're getting married!

01:17:55.393 --> 01:17:56.917
-How romantic!
-No, no, no, no, no.

01:17:57.061 --> 01:17:58.926
Hey, which of y'all did l propose to?

01:18:01.098 --> 01:18:05.398
-Wake up!
-Yo, man, you're such a buzz kill.

01:18:05.503 --> 01:18:07.300
Percy, what's wrong with you?
Why are you doing this?

01:18:07.438 --> 01:18:08.928
Both of you need to wake up, now!

01:18:09.073 --> 01:18:12.236
Look at me. Look at me.
You're in a trance, okay? We're trapped!

01:18:12.343 --> 01:18:16.109
Listen to me. lf you eat the flowers,
you're never gonna want to leave. Okay?

01:18:16.247 --> 01:18:18.078
We're gonna be stuck here forever!

01:18:20.985 --> 01:18:22.714
Oh, no. We got to go.

01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:25.380
-Okay, l see your point! Okay.
-Let's get the green pearl!

01:18:31.262 --> 01:18:34.425
Hold it right there!
Stop right where you are.

01:18:54.485 --> 01:18:58.751
Move, James Dean! Out of the way!
Let's go, guys! Car! Car!

01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:01.281
Come on, guys! Car!

01:19:02.493 --> 01:19:03.755

Come on, come on!
ln the car, in the car! Let's go!

01:19:06.163 --> 01:19:08.256
-Keys! Got the keys.
-Come on! Go!

01:19:12.369 --> 01:19:13.529
Go!

01:19:34.892 --> 01:19:38.328
Now, that's how you get out of a casino!
That's how you drive!

01:19:38.429 --> 01:19:40.522
Of course. Now that all makes sense.

01:19:40.664 --> 01:19:42.996
-What?
-That was the lair of the lotus eaters.

01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.830
They've been luring people
into their trap since ancient times.

01:19:45.936 --> 01:19:48.632
Guys, look. Tomorrow is June 21st.

01:19:49.173 --> 01:19:51.505
No. No, no. lt can't be. Today's the 15th.

01:19:51.609 --> 01:19:55.636
No, tomorrow is the 21st.
We were in there for five days.

01:19:55.746 --> 01:19:58.180
-lt felt like hours.
-Then tomorrow's the solstice.

01:19:58.282 --> 01:20:00.147
Our deadline is tomorrow at midnight.

01:20:00.251 --> 01:20:02.845
Okay, look, we've got to move it.
Where's Hades?

01:20:09.693 --> 01:20:12.025
lt's in Hollywood.

01:20:12.129 --> 01:20:15.326
All right. l can get us there in four hours.

01:20:15.733 --> 01:20:16.927
Maybe three.

01:20:45.396 --> 01:20:48.263
<i>And now,</i>

Wait, wait. Hold it.

01:21:15.626 --> 01:21:18.322
''Woe to all depraved souls."

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.920
Well, l guess
there ain't no turning back now.

01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:56.295
-Yep. Looks like we're stuck in here.
-Yeah.

01:22:08.045 --> 01:22:11.139
Hey, Perce, who's that creepy guy
with the hoodie?

01:22:11.248 --> 01:22:13.512
l don't know. Let's find out.

01:22:18.422 --> 01:22:20.151
Who are you?

01:22:20.257 --> 01:22:24.318
-We need to see Hades.
-The living are not permitted here.

01:22:24.862 --> 01:22:26.853
Die and come back.

01:22:28.165 --> 01:22:31.293
Okay, we won't die and come back, but.. .

01:22:33.037 --> 01:22:36.029
You know what?
l think l know what he wants.

01:22:36.173 --> 01:22:39.631
-What?
-You got to pay the ferryman.

01:22:39.743 --> 01:22:40.835
Watch this.

01:22:41.612 --> 01:22:44.206
Yo, my friend! What up?

01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:48.878
Okay, guess not.
Look, you like dead people, right?

01:22:49.019 --> 01:22:51.749
l got a few dead people
you might recognize.

01:22:51.889 --> 01:22:54.255
Check this out. Jackson, Grant.

01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:57.849
And look who's joining the party.
Benjamin Franklin.

01:22:57.961 --> 01:22:59.155
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

01:22:59.263 --> 01:23:01.891
Look, you give us a boat ride,
you take the money

01:23:02.032 --> 01:23:04.660
and you get an interior decorator,
'cause it is too depressing in here.

01:23:04.768 --> 01:23:06.599
All right? Here you go.

01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:15.901
That was $170!

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:19.913
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
The drachma. The drachma !

01:23:30.127 --> 01:23:31.287
Climb aboard.

01:23:31.428 --> 01:23:33.862
Thanks for telling me, man, you're
burning money. We're in a recession.

01:23:33.964 --> 01:23:36.626
-That's treason.
-Just shut up. Shut up, man. Go on.

01:23:55.155 --> 01:23:57.248
Welcome to the Underworld.

01:24:02.129 --> 01:24:03.596
What is all this?

01:24:05.499 --> 01:24:07.797
The scrapheap of human misery.

01:24:09.269 --> 01:24:11.134
Lost hopes and dreams.

01:24:13.307 --> 01:24:15.537
Wishes that never came true.

01:24:30.157 --> 01:24:33.456
All lives end in suffering and tragedy.

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:03.986
This is as far as l go.

01:25:24.211 --> 01:25:25.701
Guys, do you hear that?

01:25:25.846 --> 01:25:27.837
-Yeah, what is that?
-l don't know.

01:25:33.987 --> 01:25:36.478
-Annie, stab that thing!
-What are we gonna do?

01:25:38.392 --> 01:25:39.689
Back!

01:25:43.664 --> 01:25:46.360
-What were those things?
-Hellhounds.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.401
Yeah, well, maybe you should feed them.

01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:52.534
They sensed the presence
of another animal.

01:25:53.373 --> 01:25:56.467
-Great, they smell goat.
-A Satyr.

01:25:59.913 --> 01:26:01.744
l haven't had a Satyr

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:07.185
-visit before.
-Persephone!

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:09.755
What could possibly be taking so long?

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:11.917
Don't ignore me!

01:26:12.059 --> 01:26:15.586
Or what? What will you do?

01:26:16.263 --> 01:26:18.060
l'm already in Hell.

01:26:38.752 --> 01:26:40.413
We have visitors.

01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:44.784
Nephew.

01:26:56.637 --> 01:26:57.899
Welcome.

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.904
You have your father's looks.

01:27:02.976 --> 01:27:06.377
Always the lucky side of the family.

01:27:07.848 --> 01:27:09.782
Wait. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:27:09.917 --> 01:27:12.249
-You're Hades?
-Yes.

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:16.379
Sorry. l just didn't expect you
to look like this, man.

01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:18.458
Kind of stylish. l like it.

01:27:18.592 --> 01:27:21.823
Would you prefer that l looked like this?

01:27:25.165 --> 01:27:30.296
No! No! Look, stick to
the Mick Jagger thing! lt works for you!

01:27:39.479 --> 01:27:41.777
You're very brave coming here.

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:44.316
Come closer.

01:27:46.853 --> 01:27:48.684
Hey. Perce.

01:27:48.822 --> 01:27:53.122
l can see the look of disgust in your eyes,
but this existence was not of my choosing.

01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:57.856
l was banished here
by Zeus and your father. l am damned.

01:27:58.532 --> 01:28:00.864
My only chance of getting out of this place

01:28:01.001 --> 01:28:04.664
is to defeat my brothers and take
control of Olympus. But, of course,

01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:07.138
l'll need the bolt.

01:28:08.241 --> 01:28:11.176
-And l need my mother.
-Then we have an understanding.

01:28:11.311 --> 01:28:13.939
You give me the bolt
and l'll give you your mother.

01:28:19.152 --> 01:28:20.346
l need to tell you the truth.

01:28:20.487 --> 01:28:24.548
l'm not the lightning thief.
l don't have the bolt.

01:28:24.691 --> 01:28:26.124
l never did.

01:28:27.661 --> 01:28:29.492
Why did you come here, then?

01:28:31.832 --> 01:28:33.527
Well, l was hoping

01:28:34.501 --> 01:28:37.800
that when you saw that l wasn't the thief,
you'd let my mother go.

01:28:37.904 --> 01:28:40.737
Yes. Yes, but do you think l'm an idiot?

01:28:42.175 --> 01:28:43.972
l'm Hades!

01:28:44.077 --> 01:28:47.569
Now, give me the bolt,
or say goodbye to your mother!

01:29:12.372 --> 01:29:13.532
Percy!

01:29:22.282 --> 01:29:24.011
l thought l'd lost you forever.

01:29:24.117 --> 01:29:25.175
No.

01:29:49.109 --> 01:29:51.270
Zeus' master bolt.

01:29:55.916 --> 01:29:57.042
Liar.

01:29:57.818 --> 01:29:59.945
l swear, l don't know how that got there.

01:30:00.087 --> 01:30:02.555
-That's not even my shield!
-No!

01:30:02.656 --> 01:30:03.816
Luke rigged it!

01:30:03.957 --> 01:30:06.289
He put the bolt in his shield and used us.

01:30:06.426 --> 01:30:08.087
Luke stole the lightning bolt.

01:30:08.662 --> 01:30:10.493
l think we're done here.

01:30:11.765 --> 01:30:13.460
Feed them to the souls.

01:30:28.482 --> 01:30:32.248
We had a deal, all right?
You have the bolt! Just let us go!

01:30:32.352 --> 01:30:34.081
Summon the hounds.

01:30:35.555 --> 01:30:39.286
<i>-Ella tho!</i>
-No. No <i>ella tho.</i>

01:30:42.496 --> 01:30:44.293
Lassie, sit! Sit!

01:30:47.534 --> 01:30:48.831
No! No!

01:30:50.670 --> 01:30:53.935
l am going to be king of the gods.

01:30:54.808 --> 01:30:57.436
Stay back! Stay!

01:30:57.811 --> 01:30:59.142
Stay!

01:31:07.654 --> 01:31:09.519
All right, come on.

01:31:10.557 --> 01:31:11.854
Go on, give it back.

01:31:29.242 --> 01:31:30.470
Bad dog!

01:31:34.047 --> 01:31:36.174
He won't remember a thing!

01:31:38.451 --> 01:31:40.214
Why did you do that?

01:31:40.353 --> 01:31:44.551
Because he's cruel and abusive!

01:31:45.759 --> 01:31:47.090
The only thing l look forward to

01:31:47.227 --> 01:31:50.219
is my allotted time
away from this hellhole.

01:31:50.363 --> 01:31:53.696
A war of the gods
would put an end to that.

01:31:54.534 --> 01:31:57.833
And l'd be alone, with only him,

01:31:58.872 --> 01:32:00.100
forever.

01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:05.837
Go. Take the bolt, and your mother.

01:32:17.123 --> 01:32:18.385
Only three?

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:21.954
Oh, no.

01:32:22.429 --> 01:32:24.124
There are four of you.

01:32:24.264 --> 01:32:27.199
Each pearl transports only a single person.

01:32:28.268 --> 01:32:30.532
One of you will have to stay.

01:32:31.171 --> 01:32:33.969
-All right, l'll stay. You three go.
-What? No.

01:32:34.107 --> 01:32:35.802
No, no, no. l've achieved

01:32:35.942 --> 01:32:37.569
-my quest. l'm staying here.
-No. No!

01:32:37.677 --> 01:32:39.474
l've trained for situations like this.

01:32:39.613 --> 01:32:41.638
Guys! Guys. Knock it off.

01:32:42.315 --> 01:32:45.580
-l'm staying, because l'm the protector.
-Grover, come on.

01:32:45.685 --> 01:32:48.210
Look, man, l don't want to hear it. Just go.

01:32:48.321 --> 01:32:49.788
lt's my duty.

01:32:50.991 --> 01:32:52.424
lt's what l'm meant for.

01:32:53.193 --> 01:32:54.717
We'll come back for you.

01:32:55.795 --> 01:32:58.787
l'll take very good care of him.

01:33:00.467 --> 01:33:02.059
All right. Now move it, guys!

01:33:02.168 --> 01:33:05.103
Each of you, step on a pearl
and concentrate on where you want to go.

01:33:05.205 --> 01:33:06.570
Take this.

01:33:07.807 --> 01:33:09.172
To Olympus.

01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:11.901
Hey. Look.

01:34:17.944 --> 01:34:20.469
Zeus and Poseidon preparing for battle.

01:34:22.048 --> 01:34:25.540
No, no. This isn't the right place.
This isn't Olympus. This is.. .

01:34:25.685 --> 01:34:26.913
This is the Empire State Building!

01:34:27.053 --> 01:34:29.715
Percy! The entrance to Olympus is there!

01:34:29.856 --> 01:34:32.154
Well, there's 10 minutes till midnight.
Let's move.

01:34:32.258 --> 01:34:33.987
Percy Jackson!

01:34:41.234 --> 01:34:44.226
Well, you weren't supposed
to make it out alive.

01:34:45.271 --> 01:34:48.240
l can't let you take that bolt to Olympus.

01:34:48.775 --> 01:34:50.766
l'm the lightning thief.

01:34:51.444 --> 01:34:54.277
You hid the bolt in my shield. Why?

01:34:54.414 --> 01:34:58.510
Well, when you said you were
going to the Underworld, it hit me.

01:34:58.618 --> 01:35:02.110
''That is the perfect opportunity
to get the bolt to Hades."

01:35:02.255 --> 01:35:03.847
Why would you do that?

01:35:03.957 --> 01:35:06.357
To bring Olympus crumbling down.

01:35:07.127 --> 01:35:08.958
Percy, let's go.

01:35:09.596 --> 01:35:11.291
Let's go!

01:35:11.431 --> 01:35:15.026
Well, it's too late, 'cause l'm
returning the bolt to Zeus right now.

01:35:15.135 --> 01:35:16.932
Not before midnight.

01:35:51.504 --> 01:35:53.062
-You all right?
-Yeah.

01:35:55.141 --> 01:35:58.008
Luke! Why do you want a war of the gods?

01:35:59.446 --> 01:36:00.674
Control.

01:36:01.648 --> 01:36:04.481
They've been in power for too long.

01:36:04.617 --> 01:36:07.677
l say it's time
for our generation to take over.

01:36:07.821 --> 01:36:10.312
Remold the world in our image.

01:36:10.457 --> 01:36:13.358
-A world of new heroes.
-You're no hero.

01:36:30.610 --> 01:36:32.976
-Mom, are you all right?
-Yeah.

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:35.406
Stay here.

01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:58.862
Luke!

01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:42.440
Maybe they were wrong.

01:38:43.876 --> 01:38:46.276
Maybe you're no son of Poseidon.

01:40:11.264 --> 01:40:15.064
Yeah. l think l am the son of Poseidon.

01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:42.086
He's got the bolt! Come on!
Let's move! We've got two minutes!

01:41:24.170 --> 01:41:25.364
Olympus.

01:41:32.011 --> 01:41:35.174
Percy, l can't get through.
You've got to go!

01:41:52.298 --> 01:41:53.560
Silence!

01:42:07.547 --> 01:42:10.846
-lt is almost midnight.
-This was predestined!

01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:14.545
-You wanted this battle!
-You have only yourself to blame!

01:42:14.654 --> 01:42:19.250
Please! Let's be rational.
War is not the answer!

01:42:22.795 --> 01:42:24.422
Time has run out.

01:42:24.564 --> 01:42:25.690
Wait!

01:42:26.299 --> 01:42:28.267
Wait! Wait!

01:42:37.610 --> 01:42:42.274
My name is Percy Jackson,
and l think you might be looking for this.

01:42:59.265 --> 01:43:01.756
Give me the bolt, lightning thief.

01:43:14.013 --> 01:43:16.243
You're wise to betray your father.

01:43:16.349 --> 01:43:21.013
l didn't steal it.
And l have no connection to Poseidon.

01:43:21.654 --> 01:43:26.318
But tell me, if you didn't steal it,
then who did?

01:43:26.459 --> 01:43:29.257
Luke, son of Hermes.

01:43:33.332 --> 01:43:35.493
You see, he was angry at you.

01:43:35.635 --> 01:43:37.193
All of you.

01:43:37.336 --> 01:43:40.169
He wanted you to destroy yourselves.

01:43:51.250 --> 01:43:53.013
You have done well.

01:44:05.898 --> 01:44:07.661
Let there be peace.

01:44:12.638 --> 01:44:13.730
Hi, Mom.

01:44:14.473 --> 01:44:18.375
Annabeth, l am so proud of you.

01:44:21.547 --> 01:44:24.675
Zeus, l have a good friend.

01:44:25.251 --> 01:44:28.516
He's a Satyr named Grover.

01:44:29.055 --> 01:44:30.079
He's my protector,

01:44:30.222 --> 01:44:32.554
and the only reason
why we escaped the Underworld

01:44:32.658 --> 01:44:35.183
is because he stayed behind.

01:44:36.762 --> 01:44:39.629
And now you expect me to bring him back.

01:44:42.768 --> 01:44:44.099
Very well.

01:44:47.073 --> 01:44:50.702
l believe this assembly's business
here is finished.

01:44:51.944 --> 01:44:55.937
Brother, please. l need to speak with him.

01:44:59.852 --> 01:45:01.547
Just this once.

01:45:13.599 --> 01:45:15.328
l'll meet you outside.

01:45:25.878 --> 01:45:28.472
l'm not expecting you to forgive me.

01:45:29.682 --> 01:45:32.412
But l want you to know that l'm grateful.

01:45:32.518 --> 01:45:34.486
l didn't do it for you.

01:45:35.287 --> 01:45:37.118
l did it to save Mom.

01:45:44.397 --> 01:45:47.423
Please. We don't have much time.

01:45:50.369 --> 01:45:53.634
How old was l when you left?

01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:55.968
Seven months.

01:45:57.576 --> 01:46:01.012
Look, l didn't need you there
all the time, but.. .

01:46:03.082 --> 01:46:05.710
l would have liked to have seen you
just once.

01:46:09.188 --> 01:46:10.985
Why didn't you ever come back?

01:46:16.762 --> 01:46:18.195
l wanted to.

01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:21.826
When l was with you and your mother,

01:46:21.934 --> 01:46:25.199
l became less concerned
with my responsibilities.

01:46:25.938 --> 01:46:27.803
l was becoming human.

01:46:30.042 --> 01:46:33.910
-And that's a bad thing?
-For a god? Zeus thought so.

01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:35.604
That's why he passed the law

01:46:35.748 --> 01:46:39.184
preventing gods from
ever having contact with their children.

01:46:40.953 --> 01:46:42.580
That was because of you?

01:46:46.959 --> 01:46:49.052
But l was always watching over you.

01:46:51.097 --> 01:46:54.624
Just because you didn't see me
doesn't mean that l wasn't there.

01:46:55.634 --> 01:46:58.467
When you were troubled, l tried to help.

01:47:00.172 --> 01:47:01.605
l heard you.

01:47:02.575 --> 01:47:04.907
l know l'm not the father
you always wanted,

01:47:05.978 --> 01:47:09.243
but if you ever need me,
l'll be there for you,

01:47:09.348 --> 01:47:11.612
in your thoughts

01:47:11.751 --> 01:47:13.480
and in your dreams.

01:47:15.621 --> 01:47:17.486
l'll stand by you, Percy.

01:47:18.758 --> 01:47:19.952
Always.

01:47:46.285 --> 01:47:48.412
You can come visit me anytime.

01:47:48.521 --> 01:47:51.684
Just promise me that l don't have to see
that loser Gabe ever again.

01:47:51.824 --> 01:47:53.223
l kicked him out.

01:47:53.359 --> 01:47:57.056
Yeah, he's gone.
He's out of our lives forever.

01:47:58.564 --> 01:47:59.826
Finally.

01:48:07.439 --> 01:48:09.669
-l'm going to miss you.
-Me, too.

01:48:17.216 --> 01:48:18.376
Percy?

01:48:20.219 --> 01:48:22.016
This is where you belong.

01:48:32.965 --> 01:48:34.830
-Good job, man.
-Thanks, Perce.

01:48:35.734 --> 01:48:38.362
Ready! Aim !

01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:40.335
-Hey, whoa, Perce.. . Watch it!
-Hey!

01:48:40.439 --> 01:48:41.906
You guys gonna kill
the man who saved the world?

01:48:42.041 --> 01:48:45.738
Great job. All you guys, take a lunch break.
Thank you!

01:48:45.878 --> 01:48:48.039
So, the conquering hero
returns, triumphant.

01:48:48.147 --> 01:48:49.910
-Grover.
-Hey!

01:48:50.049 --> 01:48:52.779
-You notice anything different about me?
-No.

01:48:53.986 --> 01:48:57.422
You sure?
Anything that's improved about me?

01:48:58.390 --> 01:49:00.255
No. What, you've been working out?

01:49:00.392 --> 01:49:02.383
What, you get a new cologne?
You smell good.

01:49:02.494 --> 01:49:05.952
-Look, man. l got my horns!
-l was seeing them the whole time.

01:49:06.098 --> 01:49:08.532
l mean, look at that thing.
You got little horns in your head.

01:49:08.634 --> 01:49:09.760
-Right?
-Crazy.

01:49:09.902 --> 01:49:13.565
Zeus came through, and now
l'm Senior Protector, First Class, baby.

01:49:13.672 --> 01:49:16.140
Congratulations. Definitely earned them.

01:49:16.275 --> 01:49:17.435
Thank you, man.

01:49:19.478 --> 01:49:22.970
Keep moving, keep moving!
Don't lose interest!

01:49:23.115 --> 01:49:27.108
One foot in front of the other, and
the next thing you know, you're running!

01:49:29.021 --> 01:49:30.215
Percy.

01:49:33.492 --> 01:49:36.655
You left the camp.
You disobeyed my orders.

01:49:37.997 --> 01:49:39.965
Yeah, about that.

01:49:40.132 --> 01:49:41.565
Which is why

01:49:42.968 --> 01:49:44.560
you're my favorite student.

01:49:45.971 --> 01:49:49.407
You can receive all the training
in the world, but ultimately,

01:49:49.508 --> 01:49:51.738
you have to follow your instincts.

01:49:52.111 --> 01:49:53.635
Grace under pressure.

01:49:57.449 --> 01:50:00.441
All right. Time to train. Go suit up.

01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:02.510
You might be a big shot on Olympus,

01:50:02.655 --> 01:50:05.749
but down here,
you're still just one of my students.

01:50:05.858 --> 01:50:07.120
Move it.

01:50:09.828 --> 01:50:11.659
Nice horns, Grover.

01:50:11.797 --> 01:50:15.096
l'm serious, man.
We talked, we wooed, we dined,

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.168
-we had a great time!
-Well, l'm happy for you, you know?

01:50:17.303 --> 01:50:19.828
Persephone might really like me.
l'm serious.

01:50:25.744 --> 01:50:27.974
l think you can handle this one
on your own.

01:50:29.748 --> 01:50:31.272
All right, Perce.

01:50:34.219 --> 01:50:35.652
-Hey, Perce, awesome job, man.
-Hey, thanks.

01:50:35.754 --> 01:50:37.619
-Good job.
-Thanks.

01:50:40.392 --> 01:50:41.689
Good job.

01:50:50.869 --> 01:50:52.131
Who's next?

01:50:58.377 --> 01:51:00.470
l think l'd like to give it a shot.

01:51:12.391 --> 01:51:13.858
Welcome home.

01:51:20.866 --> 01:51:22.197
Wait!

01:51:23.135 --> 01:51:25.433
First rule of battle strategy.

01:51:25.971 --> 01:51:28.531
Don't ever let your opponent distract you.

01:53:09.608 --> 01:53:11.473
Sally, open the door!

01:53:12.511 --> 01:53:13.739
Open up!

01:53:17.683 --> 01:53:19.878
-You changed the locks?
-Yes.

01:53:20.586 --> 01:53:22.554
So, here's your junk.

01:53:22.688 --> 01:53:24.815
-You can let yourself out.
-Well.. .

01:53:25.691 --> 01:53:28.592
How am l supposed to move all this stuff
by myself?

01:53:29.294 --> 01:53:30.761
Deal with it.

01:53:35.634 --> 01:53:37.158
l need a beer.

01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:43.370
What? ''Do not open.. ."

01:53:47.813 --> 01:53:49.508
That little brat.

01:53:50.749 --> 01:53:52.910
Well, l may not live here anymore,

01:53:53.886 --> 01:53:56.047
but l'm still the king of this castle.
