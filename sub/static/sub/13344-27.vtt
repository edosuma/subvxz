WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:08.709
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.809 --> 00:10.744
I GOT A CHOICE.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.380
EITHER I ACCEPT
YOUR SUPERIORITY,

00:12.480 --> 00:14.348
AS IF YOU'RE
SOME KIND OF GOD,

00:14.448 --> 00:16.717
OR I USE
MY INTELLIGENCE

00:16.817 --> 00:18.886
AND DO A LITTLE
INVESTIGATING.

00:18.986 --> 00:21.922
YEAH, YOU'D BE
REAL SURPRISED

00:22.022 --> 00:25.093
THE KIND OF INFORMATION
YOU FIND OUT FROM
A FEW PHONE CALLS.

00:25.193 --> 00:28.762
I FOUND
A HELL OF A GOD,

00:28.862 --> 00:31.699
A GOD WHOSE WIFE
IS SLEEPING AROUND

00:31.799 --> 00:33.234
BEHIND HIS BACK,

00:33.334 --> 00:36.070
WHOSE DAUGHTER
IS FUCKING JUNKIES.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.072
AND THEN LAURA COMES ALONG

00:38.172 --> 00:41.275
AND YOU-- YOU FALL
IN LOVE WITH THAT
CRAZY SLUT.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.645
DON'T YOU FUCKING TALK
ABOUT MY PATIENTS, YOU FUCK!

01:01.929 --> 01:04.232
- OH, HI.
- HI.

01:04.332 --> 01:07.135
GOSH, YOU NEVER
GET THE MAIL.

01:07.235 --> 01:10.003
YET TODAY, 30 SECONDS
AFTER IT ARRIVES,

01:10.104 --> 01:11.905
YOU'RE SPRINTING DOWN
TO THE CURB.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.041
WHAT ON EARTH COULD
YOU BE EXPECTING?

01:14.142 --> 01:16.310
A LOVE LETTER MAYBE?

01:18.812 --> 01:22.250
- I SAW HER, PAUL.
- WHO?

01:22.350 --> 01:24.084
WHO?

01:24.185 --> 01:26.220
LAURA. I SAW HER.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.389
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"YOU SAW HER"?

01:28.489 --> 01:32.393
I WAS TAKING OUT THE TRASH
AND I SAW HER LEAVING.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.630
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
SHE QUIT THERAPY.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.367
- SHE DID QUIT.
- THEN WHAT THE HELL
WAS SHE DOING HERE?

01:39.467 --> 01:41.435
HER FATHER'S
IN THE HOSPITAL

01:41.535 --> 01:44.238
AND SHE CALLED ME
AND ASKED ME IF SHE
COULD COME IN.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.374
WHAT SHOULD I
HAVE SAID, KATE?

01:46.474 --> 01:48.676
"I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS CRISIS
WITH YOUR FATHER,

01:48.776 --> 01:50.711
BUT I'VE TOLD MY WIFE
THAT YOU'VE QUIT THERAPY."

01:50.811 --> 01:53.247
NO, YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD ME THAT SHE CAME BACK.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.683
IT WASN'T
A SOCIAL CALL.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.485
AND IF YOU WANTED TO
FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON,

01:57.585 --> 01:59.587
ALL YOU HAD
TO DO WAS ASK ME, KATE.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.190
DON'T YOU DARE TURN
THIS AROUND ON ME.

02:02.290 --> 02:05.359
WHAT, YOU THINK
YOU DESERVE HER,
YOU'VE EARNED HER,

02:05.459 --> 02:07.228
BECAUSE OF WHAT
I DID TO YOU?

02:07.328 --> 02:09.597
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.466
( chuckles )

02:12.566 --> 02:16.404
WELL, LUCKY YOU.
SAVED BY THE BELL
YET AGAIN.

02:23.777 --> 02:27.147
( theme music playing )

02:47.301 --> 02:49.437
I'M GLAD
YOU CAME BACK.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.240
I WENT AGAINST
ALL MY INSTINCTS.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.644
COME ON IN.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.222
SO WHAT WERE
YOUR INSTINCTS?

03:08.322 --> 03:09.923
YOU WANT THE TRUTH?

03:10.023 --> 03:13.894
THE FIRST WAS TO
COME BACK HERE AND BEAT
THE SHIT OUT OF YOU.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.563
AND THE SECOND ONE?

03:15.663 --> 03:17.998
WELL, THE SECOND ONE
WAS AN INSTINCT

03:18.098 --> 03:21.302
THAT I LEARNED
IN THE NAVY.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.837
IT'S A SURVIVAL TACTIC
WE TEACH:

03:23.937 --> 03:25.573
TO THINK LIKE
THE ENEMY.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.842
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE ALL SO AFRAID OF ME.

03:28.942 --> 03:32.112
HMM.
WHEN YOU SAY "ALL,"

03:32.212 --> 03:34.448
WHO WOULD YOU BE
REFERRING TO?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.917
YOU AND THE REST
OF THE WORLD.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.120
LISTEN. I REALIZE
I THREATEN YOU...

03:40.220 --> 03:42.122
AND THAT'S WHERE YOUR
AGGRESSION COMES FROM.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.425
SO IN WHAT WAY

03:44.525 --> 03:46.527
DO YOU THREATEN US,
YOU THINK?

03:46.627 --> 03:49.162
YOU CONSIDER ME
A MURDERER.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.265
THE LAST COUPLE
OF WEEKS

03:51.365 --> 03:53.301
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT--

03:53.401 --> 03:55.736
WHEN PEOPLE LOOK
IN MY EYES,

03:55.836 --> 03:58.105
LOOK AT MY HANDS,

03:58.205 --> 04:00.274
CAN THEY TELL

04:00.374 --> 04:02.410
THAT I'VE KILLED 42 PEOPLE

04:02.510 --> 04:04.312
IN THE PAST 20 YEARS?

04:04.412 --> 04:07.448
THAT'S 42 HUMAN BEINGS.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.583
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T
HIDE SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

04:09.683 --> 04:12.152
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ME--
THEY'VE GOTTA SEE THAT.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.887
AND IT SCARES THEM.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.557
SO DO YOU THINK THAT
THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU,

04:16.657 --> 04:19.126
SOMETHING OBVIOUS
THAT PEOPLE SEE?

04:19.226 --> 04:22.563
YOU PROBABLY WANTED
TO STRANGLE ME

04:22.663 --> 04:24.365
THE FIRST TIME I WALKED
THROUGH THAT DOOR.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.434
IN THE LAST SESSION,
YOU FINALLY GOT A CHANCE

04:26.534 --> 04:28.869
TO SHOW YOUR HATRED
FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME.

04:28.969 --> 04:32.873
I THINK MAYBE THAT'S
HOW YOU SEE YOURSELF, ALEX.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.376
MAYBE THAT'S
WHY YOU PUSHED ME

04:35.476 --> 04:37.345
TO SUCH
A VIOLENT PLACE.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.613
SO THAT I'D TREAT YOU
THE WAY THAT

04:39.713 --> 04:41.415
YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD BE TREATED.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.817
LET ME REMIND YOU,
YOU ATTACKED ME.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.219
MMM.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.288
SO WHAT DID YOU FEEL

04:48.389 --> 04:51.359
WHEN I ATTACKED YOU?

04:51.459 --> 04:52.960
WHAT DID I FEEL?

04:53.060 --> 04:56.497
A SLIGHT TREMOR
IN THE WING.

04:56.597 --> 05:00.668
- THAT'S IT.
- SO NO BIG DEAL.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.570
NO BIG DEAL.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.938
BUT, ALEX, I PUSHED YOU
AGAINST THE BOOKCASE.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.908
I THREW COFFEE
IN YOUR FACE.

05:08.008 --> 05:11.645
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
WHAT HAPPENED
IN YOUR BODY?

05:11.745 --> 05:13.146
WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR HEAD?

05:13.246 --> 05:15.282
HOLD ON A SECOND.
I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.250
YOU HAVEN'T APOLOGIZED YET.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.919
OKAY, BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY

05:19.019 --> 05:21.822
"I APOLOGIZE. I'M SORRY.
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN."

05:21.922 --> 05:24.758
I'VE BEEN HERE FIVE MINUTES,
AND I GOT NOTHING FROM YOU.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.326
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.630
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.331
I APOLOGIZE.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.736
IT SHOULD NOT
HAVE HAPPENED.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.475
BUT... I FELT

05:41.575 --> 05:45.212
VERY OFFENDED
BY WHAT YOU SAID.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.647
OFFENDED?

05:46.747 --> 05:49.450
NO NO NO.
THAT'S NOT PART
OF THE DEAL.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.252
NO, I CAN SAY WHATEVER
THE HELL I WANT IN HERE.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.187
THAT'S THE POINT
OF GOING TO A SHRINK.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.489
YOU WANT ME TO CENSOR
EVERY SENTENCE

05:55.589 --> 05:57.591
OR KEEP WONDERING IF
WHAT I SAY MIGHT HURT YOU?

05:57.691 --> 06:00.828
WELL, IT'S STILL LIKE
A RELATIONSHIP, ALEX.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.363
THERE ARE BOUNDARIES.

06:03.464 --> 06:07.100
I FELT THAT YOU WERE
OUT TO HURT ME.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.671
AND I... WAS

06:10.771 --> 06:12.806
VERY HURT.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.077
WHAT OFFENDED YOU
SO MUCH?

06:17.177 --> 06:19.212
I MEAN, IT WAS
ALL TRUE, WASN'T IT?

06:19.312 --> 06:22.182
WELL, YOU INVADED
MY PRIVACY.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.184
YOU TALKED ABOUT
THE PEOPLE I LOVE,

06:24.284 --> 06:26.319
AND YOU SPOKE
ABOUT THEM WITH CONTEMPT

06:26.420 --> 06:29.056
AND WITH
WHAT I FELT WAS

06:29.156 --> 06:31.492
DELIBERATE CRUELTY.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.963
HUH.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.099
OKAY.

06:41.368 --> 06:44.738
SO I GUESS
MY THERAPY IS OVER...

06:44.838 --> 06:48.542
- NOW, RIGHT?
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
I SAID, ALEX.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.778
NO, BUT IT'S
WHAT YOU THINK.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.614
YOU'RE TIRED OF TAKING
THE SHIT I GIVE YOU
ALL THE TIME

06:53.714 --> 06:55.348
AND, ACTUALLY,
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.718
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D HAVE GOTTEN RID
OF ME A LONG TIME AGO.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.687
SO IS THAT WHY
YOU SAY THOSE THINGS?

06:59.787 --> 07:03.223
IN THE HOPES
THAT I WOULD-- WHAT?
--RUN AWAY, KICK YOU OUT?

07:03.323 --> 07:05.593
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
ALEX.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.498
YOU GUYS REALLY DO LIVE
IN A BUBBLE. YOU LIVE
IN THIS WORLD, YOU DON'T--

07:10.598 --> 07:13.200
IT'S ALL THEORIES.
YOU DON'T ENGAGE.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.105
WHAT?

07:23.110 --> 07:27.214
FINISH THAT THOUGHT.
WHAT WERE YOU
GOING TO SAY?

07:27.314 --> 07:31.619
NO, I JUST REMEMBERED
THIS DREAM I HAD.

07:31.719 --> 07:34.421
I WAS ON THE GROUND,
AND I WAS DRIVING
THIS LITTLE CAR

07:34.522 --> 07:37.858
ON THE IRAQI INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT HIGHWAY.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.994
THEY CALL IT
"THE HIGHWAY TO HELL."

07:41.094 --> 07:44.998
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
I'M IN BAGHDAD IN
THIS TRAFFIC JAM.

07:45.098 --> 07:48.168
ABOVE MY HEAD
I SEE THIS ENEMY PLANE.
IT'S A CZECH MiG.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.670
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT IT IS EXACTLY,

07:49.770 --> 07:52.205
BUT THIS MiG
IS BEING FOLLOWED

07:52.305 --> 07:55.175
BY ONE OF OUR JETS,
AN F-16.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.077
EVERYONE'S LOOKING UP,
WATCHING.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.647
AND I SAY TO MYSELF,

07:59.747 --> 08:01.615
"WHY ISN'T HE SHOOTING?

08:01.715 --> 08:04.852
WHY DOESN'T HE BLOW
HIM OUT OF THE SKY?"

08:04.952 --> 08:07.721
NOW MAYBE HE'S AFRAID THAT
ALL THE DEBRIS WILL FALL
ON THE PEOPLE BELOW,

08:07.821 --> 08:11.224
BUT I KNOW IN THE DREAM
THE ORDERS ARE TO TAKE
THAT FUCKER DOWN.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.127
SO THEY'RE FLYING
REAL CLOSE LIKE THIS
AND MANEUVERING,

08:14.227 --> 08:16.897
AND OUR GUY
DOESN'T LAUNCH.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.132
AND THE ENEMY PLANE
IS GETTING AWAY

08:19.232 --> 08:20.634
AND IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.636
I MEAN, SHIT, HE'S ON
HIS WAY TO OUR BASE CAMP.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.437
ALL THE PEOPLE
ON THE GROUND BELOW,

08:24.538 --> 08:28.075
THEY'RE WAITING FOR HIM
TO TAKE THE MiG DOWN,
AND THEY'RE BLOODTHIRSTY.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.377
AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

08:30.477 --> 08:33.146
THEY JUST FLY AWAY.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.018
AND THAT'S IT.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.755
HMM. SO DO YOU THINK YOU
WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER

08:41.855 --> 08:44.758
- IF YOU HAD BEEN
UP THERE?
- SHIT.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.493
ANY PILOT WORTH HIS SALT
WOULD HAVE BLOWN

08:46.594 --> 08:49.129
THAT ASSHOLE
TO KINGDOM COME.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.431
AND WHO IS THE PILOT?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.634
MAYBE IT'S ME.
I DON'T KNOW.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.369
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CAN'T SHOOT?

08:56.469 --> 08:58.071
WHY NOT?

08:58.171 --> 09:00.708
I DON'T KNOW.

09:00.808 --> 09:04.044
MAYBE BECAUSE
THE OTHER GUY,
THE OTHER PILOT,

09:04.144 --> 09:06.513
IS NOT THAT DANGEROUS.
I KNEW THAT.

09:06.614 --> 09:09.149
HE'S ONLY--

09:09.249 --> 09:12.152
WHAT? HE'S ONLY WHAT?

09:12.252 --> 09:15.455
WHO'S SITTING
IN THE PLANE?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.858
WHO'S SITTING
IN THE ENEMY PLANE THAT
YOU REFUSE TO SHOOT DOWN?

09:17.958 --> 09:20.027
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S THERE.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.630
- WHO IS THE ENEMY, ALEX?
- HEY, STOP, MAN.

09:22.730 --> 09:25.799
JEEZ, WHEN YOU WANT
TO PRESSURE, YOU PRESSURE.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.941
I DON'T KNOW.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.345
WHO'S MY ENEMY? YOU?

09:38.445 --> 09:41.581
- IS THAT HOW IT FEELS?
- NO, IT'S NOT YOU.
YOU'RE NOT THERE.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.353
NO.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.689
MAYBE IT'S MY FATHER.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.194
WHAT? WHAT?

09:54.294 --> 09:56.396
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER,
BUT YOU DON'T WANNA--

09:56.496 --> 09:58.065
YOU WANT ME
TO COME UP WITH IT.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.900
NO, IT'S JUST A DREAM.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.036
I'M JUST HELPING YOU
TO LOOK AT IT.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.273
- THAT'S ALL.
- OKAY, WELL, THEN YOU
MUST HAVE SOME CHART

10:06.373 --> 10:08.408
OR SOMETHING AROUND HERE
TELLING YOU WHAT EVERY PART

10:08.508 --> 10:10.243
OF A DREAM REPRESENTS
IN REALITY.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.445
NO NO, NOT REALLY.
SOMETIMES A NUMBER
OF IMAGES

10:12.545 --> 10:14.782
CAN REPRESENT
THE SAME THING.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.985
SO IT'S ME? THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, RIGHT?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.587
THAT I WAS
THE ENEMY PILOT?

10:20.688 --> 10:24.024
I'M MY OWN ENEMY?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.126
LOOK, IT'S NOT CLEAR
ACTUALLY THAT HE'S
EVEN AN ENEMY.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.062
IT'S NOT THAT HE DOESN'T
HAVE IDENTIFICATION MARKS
ON THE PLANE.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.198
I'M JUST NOT FAMILIAR
WITH IT.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.033
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.705
BUT HE IS TRYING
TO GET AWAY FROM YOU.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.774
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS GUY,

10:40.874 --> 10:44.011
THIS PILOT,
THIS FLEEING PILOT?

10:44.111 --> 10:45.913
I THINK HE'S
A FUCKING COWARD.

10:46.013 --> 10:49.182
- OH, YEAH. WHAT ELSE?
- HE'S NOT A MAN.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.551
HE'S RUNNING AWAY
LIKE A PUSSY INSTEAD
OF TURNING AROUND,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.520
STANDING HIS GROUND
AND FIGHTING.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.188
I'M DYING TO COME UP
TO THAT PITIFUL FUCKER

10:55.288 --> 10:58.425
AND SHOVE
AN AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE
UP HIS REAR BURNER.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.108
WHAT'RE YOU THINKING?

11:18.746 --> 11:20.180
JUST SAY IT.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.057
YOU THINK
I'M A FAGGOT?

11:34.427 --> 11:37.464
THAT WOULD GO
RIGHT ALONG WITH ALL
MY FATHER'S THEORIES.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.900
ONLY GIRLS AND FAGS
SEE A SHRINK.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.135
SO WHAT IF I'M A FAG?

11:42.235 --> 11:45.238
YOU SAID IT
VERY CLEARLY BEFORE.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.140
DID I?

11:47.240 --> 11:49.176
WELL, MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
SAY IT, BUT YOU'VE BEEN
LEADING ME THERE.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.078
I HAVE?

11:51.178 --> 11:54.114
YEAH, YOU'RE DYING TO SAY
IT'S A HOMOSEXUAL DREAM.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.715
I'M TAILING HIM.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.285
I SEE FIRE COMING OUT
OF HIS BACK BURNER.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.153
I'M WANNA SHOVE MY--

12:07.394 --> 12:08.996
IT ALL FITS,
DOESN'T IT?

12:18.939 --> 12:21.474
EVEN DANIEL
NEVER SUSPECTED IT.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.315
WELL, THAT COULD EXPLAIN
A LOT OF THINGS.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.217
WHAT THINGS?

12:30.317 --> 12:31.885
LAURA, FOR INSTANCE.

12:31.985 --> 12:35.622
THAT LOUSY FUCK
WE HAD THE FIRST TIME.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.825
AND MICHAELA.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.797
THE FACT THAT I'M
SUDDENLY NOT ATTRACTED
TO HER ANYMORE.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.567
WE SAW EACH OTHER
THIS WEEK AT A RESTAURANT,

12:47.667 --> 12:49.369
AND SHE WANTS ME
TO COME BACK HOME
AND THOUGHT IT'D BE BETTER

12:49.469 --> 12:52.840
IF WE TALKED
TO EACH OTHER
IN PERSON.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.076
SHE WAS
DRIVING HARD, MAN,

12:56.176 --> 12:59.446
JUST ON A MISSION,
JUST ON THE ATTACK.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.282
SHE WANTED US TO START OFF
BY GETTING A ROOM ASAP.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.185
THERE'S THAT HOTEL
ABOVE THE RESTAURANT.
I SAID I COULDN'T.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.587
I COULDN'T.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.656
I TOLD HER I HAD
SOMEWHERE TO BE,

13:09.756 --> 13:12.692
THAT WE WOULD DO IT
ANOTHER TIME.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.762
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
DID HAVE SOMETHING
ELSE TO DO THAT NIGHT.

13:15.863 --> 13:19.166
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
WITH DANIEL AND HIS--

13:19.266 --> 13:21.434
HIS PARTNER SEAN
TO A PARTY.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.805
YOU UNDERSTAND
THIS AMAZING WOMAN WANTS

13:25.906 --> 13:28.141
TO FUCK THE SHIT OUT
OF ME IN A FIVE-STAR HOTEL

13:28.241 --> 13:30.477
AND INSTEAD
I'M GOING TO GEORGETOWN
WITH THESE TWO FAGS.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.312
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.781
AND WHY DO YOU THINK

13:34.882 --> 13:39.086
YOU'D RATHER SPEND
TIME WITH THEM?

13:42.055 --> 13:45.358
EVERYTHING'S
A JOKE WITH THEM.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.394
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR
WITH THEIR WORLD,

13:47.494 --> 13:51.331
BUT THEIR HUMOR IS
IN SEEING EVERYTHING
FROM THE OUTSIDE,

13:51.431 --> 13:53.967
LIKE THEY'RE NOT A PART
OF IT, LIKE-- LIKE--

13:54.067 --> 13:55.903
LIKE THEY'RE ABOVE IT.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.905
AND BY "THEY,"
YOU MEAN HOMOSEXUALS?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.873
YEAH, ESPECIALLY SEAN'S
CROWD.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.142
I MEAN,
HE'S GENUINELY QUEER.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.145
YOU KNOW,
HE'S NOT THE KIND THAT'S
IN CONFLICT WITH HIMSELF.

14:05.245 --> 14:08.848
I MEAN, HE'S-- THIS--
SEAN IS IMMUNE TO TENSION,

14:08.949 --> 14:12.752
HE'S HAPPY.
HE'S HAPPY ALL THE TIME.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.154
HE JUST HAS
NO SUBCONSCIOUS.

14:14.254 --> 14:18.058
EVERYTHING IS
RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.030
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT--

14:23.130 --> 14:25.565
IS THAT SOMETHING
THAT YOU ENVY?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.270
WELL, THEY DON'T
PRESSURE ME.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.041
I MEAN,
THEY GIVE YOU SHIT

14:34.141 --> 14:36.944
TO PROVOKE YOU,
AND THEY LOVE
THAT SHIT, BUT...

14:37.044 --> 14:39.646
YOU KNOW,
SEAN ASKED ME

14:39.746 --> 14:43.250
"WHY DO YOU
ALWAYS DESPERATELY

14:43.350 --> 14:45.885
TRY TO PLEASE EVERYBODY
ALL THE TIME?

14:45.986 --> 14:49.089
GOD AND COUNTRY--
EVERYBODY?"

14:49.189 --> 14:51.591
BUT IT'S BULLSHIT.
WITH THEM, THEY DON'T CARE.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.394
THEY REALLY DON'T CARE.

14:54.494 --> 14:55.695
THEY DON'T DEMAND OF ME

14:55.795 --> 14:58.932
TO BE ANYTHING... EXTRA.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.203
THAT NIGHT WE GOT
HOME ABOUT 4:00 A.M.,

15:03.303 --> 15:04.871
AND DANIEL WENT
TO THE BEDROOM,

15:04.972 --> 15:06.339
AND SEAN AND I STAYED OUT
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.176
HE GOT A DVD,
SOME GAY PORN THING.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.946
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
IF HE WAS TRYING TO
PROVOKE ME OR WHAT.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.317
HE EVEN SUGGESTED AFTERWARDS
THAT I'D BE READY FOR BED.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.988
HE SAID IT JOKINGLY,
BUT HE WASN'T PLAYING.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.657
HE TOLD ME ONCE,

15:24.757 --> 15:27.127
"I DIDN'T KNOW
THE MEANING OF LIFE

15:27.227 --> 15:30.530
UNTIL I GOT FUCKED
IN THE ASS."

15:36.836 --> 15:38.471
( exhales deeply )

16:10.037 --> 16:11.938
I ONCE READ THAT,
PSYCHOLOGICALLY,

16:12.039 --> 16:14.607
WATER SYMBOLIZES EMOTIONS.

16:16.876 --> 16:19.979
I WONDER WHAT YOUR COLLECTION
OF BOATS SAYS ABOUT YOU.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.417
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THAT
I'M AN EMOTIONAL WRECK.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.522
MAYBE YOU WANT
TO GO OUT TO SEA,

16:29.622 --> 16:31.758
BUT YOU DON'T.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.130
YOU MEAN THAT
I WANT TO EXPRESS
MY FEELINGS, BUT I CAN'T.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.972
MY FATHER'S
A LIFETIME DEMOCRAT,

16:46.073 --> 16:47.874
A WAR PROTESTER.

16:47.974 --> 16:51.211
AND I KNEW THAT
IF I JOINED THE NAVY,

16:51.311 --> 16:53.113
IT WOULD PISS HIM OFF.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.748
SO FUCK IT,
I WENT R.O.T.C.
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

16:55.848 --> 16:57.750
AND THEN
I GOT MY WINGS.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.054
HE COULDN'T
TELL ME SHIT.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.756
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
YOU WERE HERE.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.094
YOU SAID THAT
YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE

17:07.194 --> 17:10.497
TO BE A PILOT, THAT LIFE
CHOSE IT FOR YOU.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.166
- YEAH.
- BUT I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.968
I THINK MAYBE YOU DID
CHOOSE THAT PATH,

17:16.069 --> 17:18.605
AND THAT YOU DID IT
TO DEFY YOUR FATHER.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.607
HE WANTED ME TO BE HARD.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.176
THERE'S NOTHING HARDER
THAN A TOPGUN GRAD.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.678
YEAH, BUT, THAT'S STILL
A REACTION TO HIM.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.847
IT'S NOT YOUR DESIRE.

17:27.947 --> 17:30.983
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE IN TOUCH
WITH WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.120
WHAT I REALLY WANT?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

17:33.220 --> 17:36.356
WHAT I REALLY WANTED WAS
TO BE SOMETHING ELSE?

17:36.456 --> 17:38.925
GAY?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.294
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ATTRACTED
TO MEN, ALEX?

17:41.394 --> 17:45.465
- NO.
- EVER HAD A SEXUAL FANTASY
ABOUT A MAN?

17:45.565 --> 17:48.668
I HAVE NEVER, NO.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.337
NO.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.072
SO WHEN YOU SAY
THE WORD GAY,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

17:53.173 --> 17:55.442
I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T TAKE ME THERE, MAN.

17:57.009 --> 18:00.447
THIS, SAYING WHAT
YOU THINK ALL THE TIME--
THAT'S GAY.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.915
THOSE GUYS,
THEY HAVE NO FILTERS.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.551
WHAT ELSE?

18:08.288 --> 18:10.623
TALKING ABOUT
YOUR FEELINGS
ALL THE TIME.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.293
SO WHAT YOU DO HERE,
FOR EXAMPLE, THE WAY
YOU INTERACT WITH ME,

18:13.393 --> 18:16.596
YOUR FATHER SAID--
HE SAID THAT ANYBODY
WHO GOES TO A SHRINK

18:16.696 --> 18:19.566
IS A-- IS A FAG.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.707
HOW DID YOU GET ON
WITH YOUR DAD WHEN
YOU WERE A KID?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.517
I REMEMBER AS A KID

18:37.617 --> 18:39.519
MY FATHER TAKING ME
TO A CHURCH.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.621
THIS WAS
THE RIVERSIDE CHURCH
UP IN HARLEM.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.991
AND BACK IN THOSE DAYS,
I LIVED KIND OF
A DOUBLE LIFE.

18:45.091 --> 18:47.494
DURING THE WEEK,
I WENT TO THIS ALL-
BOYS PRIVATE SCHOOL.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.897
IT WAS ELITE,
THE FINEST TEACHERS.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.766
- IT WAS--
- THE BEST, RIGHT?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.735
RIGHT.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.037
IT WAS ALSO A TOTALLY
SHELTERED ENVIRONMENT.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.472
SO ON THE WEEKEND,
MY DAD WOULD TAKE ME

18:59.572 --> 19:02.942
TO ALL THESE REAL
ROUGH GHETTO AREAS,

19:03.042 --> 19:05.545
TO PLACES
WHERE HE VOLUNTEERED
HIS TIME AND MONEY.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.448
HE WANTED TO MAKE
SURE THAT I KNEW
HOW LUCKY I WAS

19:08.548 --> 19:10.717
TO LIVE MY LITTLE SOFT,
CUSHY LIFE.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.586
I DREADED THOSE FUCKING
WEEKENDS, HATED THEM.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.488
IT'S LIKE HE WAS ALWAYS
TRYING TO TEST ME.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.425
ANYWAY, THE RIVERSIDE CHURCH
HAD THIS ATHLETIC PROGRAM

19:18.525 --> 19:20.227
THAT MY DAD SUPPORTED.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.262
HE NEEDED
TO TALK TO THE GUY
THAT RAN THE PLACE,

19:22.362 --> 19:23.963
SO THEY TOLD ME,

19:24.063 --> 19:27.400
"YOU WAIT OUTSIDE,
SHOOT SOME BASKETS."

19:27.500 --> 19:30.136
SO IT'S EARLY
AND THE COURTS
ARE DESERTED.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.971
AND IT'S A BAD AREA,

19:32.071 --> 19:35.007
BUT LONG STORY SHORT,
THIS KID COMES UP.
HE'S ABOUT--

19:35.107 --> 19:37.410
I DON'T KNOW--
HE'S 14.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.647
AND HE BEAT
THE HELL OUT OF ME.

19:40.747 --> 19:44.484
HE KICKED ME IN THE HEAD
A FEW TIMES.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.857
BUT HE WOUND UP TAKING
SOME LITTLE BULLSHIT
CHAIN I HAD

19:50.957 --> 19:53.626
AND MY SNEAKERS--
HE TOOK MY SNEAKERS,
TOOK MY SOCKS,

19:53.726 --> 19:55.428
AND HE EVEN TOOK
THIS LITTLE

19:55.528 --> 19:59.131
HALF-FULL PACK
OF CHEWING GUM.

19:59.232 --> 20:03.035
AND I WENT UPSTAIRS

20:03.135 --> 20:07.039
AND MY DAD SEES ME,
AND HE SEES I JUST
GOT MY ASS KICKED,

20:07.139 --> 20:11.043
THAT I GOT NO SNEAKERS,
NO SOCKS.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.613
AND I STARTED TO TELL HIM
WHAT HAPPENED.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.286
AND I STARTED CRYING.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.455
SO MY DAD...

20:24.156 --> 20:26.359
SLAPPED
THE SHIT OUT OF ME--

20:28.995 --> 20:30.697
SOUNDED LIKE
A WHIP CRACK.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.334
AND HE MADE ME WALK
AROUND BAREFOOT

20:34.434 --> 20:36.403
FOR THE WHOLE REST
OF THE DAY

20:36.503 --> 20:38.705
JUST TO TEACH ME
A LESSON.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.908
WHAT AGE WERE YOU?

20:46.045 --> 20:48.381
11.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.584
THE NEXT WEEKEND,
HE TOOK ME TO A GYM

20:51.684 --> 20:53.753
TO MEET UP
WITH THIS GUY NAMED TOM.

20:53.853 --> 20:57.424
AND TOM SAID THAT
THERE ARE TWO TYPES
OF MARTIAL ARTS.

20:57.524 --> 21:01.027
"ONE IS THE KIND
THAT'S A PHYSICAL
AND SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE,

21:01.127 --> 21:03.463
A WAY OF LIFE.
THE SECOND TYPE

21:03.563 --> 21:06.132
IS WHERE
YOU LEARN TO FIGHT,

21:06.232 --> 21:08.134
AND THIS HERE
IS A FIGHTING GYM.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.903
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?"

21:11.003 --> 21:13.806
I DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT ANYBODY

21:13.906 --> 21:17.610
TO EVER PUT
THEIR HANDS ON ME
LIKE THAT EVER AGAIN.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.612
SO I CAME FOUR DAYS
A WEEK AFTER SCHOOL,

21:19.712 --> 21:22.315
AND I LEARNED,
AND I LEARNED FAST.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.351
AND THE NEXT TIME
SOME KID PICKED ON ME,

21:24.451 --> 21:27.754
I BEAT HIS FACE
TO A PULP.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.925
YOU COULDN'T
EVEN RECOGNIZE HIM.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.166
'CAUSE, SEE,
FEAR IS LIKE FIRE.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.069
IF YOU MASTER IT,
THEN IT CAN HEAT YOUR
HOUSE, COOK YOUR FOOD,

21:43.169 --> 21:47.707
BUT IF IT GETS THE BEST
OF YOU, IT CAN BURN YOU.
IT CAN DESTROY YOU.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.942
( voice cracking )
YOU CONTROL YOUR FEAR...

21:52.579 --> 21:55.482
YOU CONTROL YOUR FEAR,
YOU CONTROL YOUR LIFE.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.785
( clears throat )

22:18.037 --> 22:19.572
EXCUSE ME.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.416
( sobbing )

23:34.213 --> 23:35.882
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

23:37.450 --> 23:39.886
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.156
DO WHAT?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.092
THIS THERAPY. I...

23:47.994 --> 23:50.029
IT'S TOO MUCH FOR ME.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.898
I THINK
I NEED A BREAK--

23:51.998 --> 23:53.833
A FEW WEEKS,
A MONTH.

24:00.707 --> 24:03.275
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S LEADING ANYWHERE.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.877
IT'S NOT LEADING ANYWHERE.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.947
WHERE DO YOU WANT IT
TO LEAD, ALEX?

24:09.849 --> 24:12.885
SOMEPLACE WHERE I FEEL
LESS SHITTY ABOUT MYSELF;

24:17.724 --> 24:20.660
SOMEPLACE WHERE I CAN FIND
SOME BALANCE IN MY LIFE;

24:24.263 --> 24:26.799
SOMEPLACE SANER.
I MISS FLYING.

24:31.704 --> 24:36.208
SOMEHOW EVERYTHING IS
JUST MUCH SIMPLER UP THERE.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.879
I CAN FOCUS ON SOMETHING.
THE ONLY THING YOU GOTTA
THINK ABOUT IS THE MISSION.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.151
IT'S QUIET.

24:47.854 --> 24:51.524
IS IT POSSIBLE
TO GET THAT FEELING
ON THE GROUND?

24:51.624 --> 24:52.892
DO YOU THINK?

24:56.395 --> 24:57.730
I DON'T KNOW.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.642
YOU KNOW, I GOT A CALL
FROM MY WING COMMANDER.

25:09.742 --> 25:12.912
HE'S INTERESTED
IN KNOWING HOW I'M DOING.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.948
HE'S FISHING.
HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT IF I'M READY...

25:16.949 --> 25:18.718
FOR ACTIVE DUTY.

25:20.186 --> 25:24.857
IT'S ALL SORTS
OF TESTS, THOUGH.
IT'S A LONG PROCESS.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.259
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
READY FOR THAT, ALEX?

25:27.359 --> 25:29.929
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

25:30.029 --> 25:32.632
NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE READY.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.640
MAYBE I CAN DISCUSS IT
WITH MICHAELA.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.075
I DON'T THINK SEAN
AND DANIEL WOULD
BE MUCH HELP.

25:43.175 --> 25:46.278
GAYS DON'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND THE MILITARY,

25:46.378 --> 25:48.881
OR VICE VERSA.

25:48.981 --> 25:52.251
ALEX, THESE FEELINGS
AND MEMORIES

25:52.351 --> 25:54.453
THAT YOU HAVE
ABOUT YOUR FATHER,

25:54.553 --> 25:57.356
I THINK THIS IS
REALLY SOMETHING

25:57.456 --> 26:01.560
WE SHOULD
COME BACK TO.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.266
YEAH.

26:07.366 --> 26:10.970
I MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO
IN OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
