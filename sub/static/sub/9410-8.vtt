- Squish 'em like bugs.
- That's stupid.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.667
- Let's twist 'em like pretzels.
- No.

16:43.667 --> 16:47.500
Put a spell on them.
A magic spell.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.133
No! Squish them.

16:51.467 --> 16:56.200
I know.
We could squish them like bugs.

16:56.200 --> 16:59.233
- That's what I said.
- Why are you doing this?

17:00.233 --> 17:02.967
Don't you know anything
about gnomes?

17:02.967 --> 17:04.800
It's what we do.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.500
[ Yellow Gnome ]
It's in our nature.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.200
We make mischief.

17:09.633 --> 17:12.567
Anywhere, anytime,

17:12.567 --> 17:14.933
and to anyone.

17:14.933 --> 17:17.000
Like you.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.733
Oh!

17:19.733 --> 17:22.467
- Like you!
- Oh, yeah?

17:26.833 --> 17:28.733
[ Yellow Gnome ]
Look what you did!

17:28.733 --> 17:31.367
That's it.
The light freezes them.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.767
- Me? You started it.
- The light! Get the light!

17:37.433 --> 17:39.433
Get off him.

17:42.533 --> 17:46.033
[ Joe ] Hold it right there or
I'll turn you into Mount Rushmore.

17:46.033 --> 17:48.967
We're free.
The light freezes them.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.400
[ Mindy ]
They're lawn gnomes by day.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.933
But in the dark,
they're just plain gnomes.

17:53.933 --> 17:55.500
[ Gnome ]
Not plain.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.667
Deluxe.

18:08.667 --> 18:11.567
- Come on.
- They're gonna get us.

18:15.133 --> 18:18.033
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

18:18.033 --> 18:20.333
What are we gonna do?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.933
Yeah. What are you
gonna do now, smart guy?

18:24.333 --> 18:27.667
- Get ready.
- You'll never make it.

18:27.667 --> 18:28.967
Get 'em!

18:28.967 --> 18:31.000
Mindy, run!

18:34.400 --> 18:36.533
Come on!

18:47.900 --> 18:51.767
[ Klaxon Blaring ]

18:58.267 --> 18:59.267
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

18:59.267 --> 19:01.267
- Got ya, Joe Burton!
- Let's get out of here.

19:01.267 --> 19:03.967
Don't you kids
run away from me!

19:03.967 --> 19:08.067
I've had it with this junk.
I'm gonna get rid of it once and for all.

19:08.067 --> 19:12.567
Starting with you.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.433
[ Exhales ]

19:18.433 --> 19:20.133
[ Grunts ]

19:20.133 --> 19:22.500
- [ Growls ]
- Aaah!

19:25.667 --> 19:29.167
Well, it's got quite a lovely face.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.167
Mmm. Hmm, hmm.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.233
No. I don't know.
Let's take a look over here.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.533
Watch yourself.

19:37.533 --> 19:40.133
What are we looking at
over here?

19:40.133 --> 19:43.000
Oh, oh! Oh!

19:43.000 --> 19:44.367
No. No.

19:44.367 --> 19:46.900
I don't think I've ever seen
one of those, not since--

19:46.900 --> 19:48.500
What is that?

19:49.433 --> 19:51.800
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

20:00.067 --> 20:03.400
It was a most difficult decision,
Mr. Burton.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.467
We love your inventiveness...

20:05.467 --> 20:09.767
and the way you mix the natural
world with whimsy and fantasy.

20:09.767 --> 20:11.800
We've never seen
another garden like it.

20:11.800 --> 20:16.467
- Oh. Well, thank you very much.
- I knew you could do it, dear.

20:16.467 --> 20:20.567
Well, I'd just like to say that I'm deeply
honored to accept the grand prize.

20:20.567 --> 20:23.300
Well, I'm sure you would be
if you had won.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.500
But I thought you--

20:25.500 --> 20:28.000
Oh, we were about to give you
the grand prize, all right.

20:28.467 --> 20:30.867
But then we saw--
[ Exhales ]

20:30.867 --> 20:33.267
Well, it was so-- so jarring,

20:33.267 --> 20:35.167
so out of place,

20:35.167 --> 20:37.533
so-- so ugly.

20:37.533 --> 20:39.900
Frankly, we were shocked.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.000
Are you talking about
the lawn gnomes?

20:42.000 --> 20:45.333
Oh, no.
We love the lawn gnomes.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.633
Cute little fellows.
Adorable.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.733
Well, then what
are you talking about?

20:53.233 --> 20:56.000
That hideous lawn ornament.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
That.
