Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:35.337 --> 00:36.471
I brought you your stuff.

00:36.505 --> 00:39.049
Never pictured you as a
snow globe kinda guy.

00:39.050 --> 00:40.634
My mom gave me that one.

00:40.669 --> 00:42.977
You tim riggins?
Need to ask you a few questions

00:43.012 --> 00:44.773
About some missing cars.

00:45.773 --> 00:48.648
You're a good dude, and jess,
she deserves the best.

00:48.683 --> 00:50.124
I'm glad you two are together.

00:50.159 --> 00:51.963
What if I don't want to have the baby?

00:51.998 --> 00:55.116
You provided this girl The
information to get her child aborted.

00:55.151 --> 00:56.151
I did not, ma'am.

00:56.186 --> 00:59.258
We spent some time last night
Preparing a statement for the press.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.409
We've lined up a reporter who's friendly...

01:00.444 --> 01:04.090
- Paul, this is an apology.
- You'll get to keep your job.

01:06.540 --> 01:09.519
Let's remember this is a classic rivalry,

01:09.554 --> 01:12.304
But a friendly rivalry,

01:12.401 --> 01:15.039
So that we can move
forward to what I hope is

01:15.040 --> 01:18.557
A long tradition of our subway series-

01:18.592 --> 01:21.966
Our big cat clash.

01:22.614 --> 01:24.397
Let's hear it.

01:25.276 --> 01:27.544
Let's bring our two coaches together

01:27.545 --> 01:31.065
To show us how we come together
Instead of falling apart.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.836
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

01:32.871 --> 01:34.146
Thank you so much.

01:34.179 --> 01:37.179
Let's bring our team captains together too.

01:38.227 --> 01:41.305
Each of them have led their team to victory,

01:41.306 --> 01:44.034
And one of them is gonna
do that one more time.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.032
We know how to get along in this town.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.542
I think we can all come together and say,

01:48.543 --> 01:52.513
"go, cats, go." go, cats, go!

01:52.548 --> 01:55.823
Go, cats, go! Go, cats, go!

01:59.686 --> 02:01.721
How many cars were there?

02:01.755 --> 02:03.923
Uh, a few.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.379
A few. Five? More than five?

02:06.414 --> 02:10.094
- It was more than five.
- More than five?

02:10.095 --> 02:12.165
Baby, we're trying to have a meeting here.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.566
Seriously.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.384
Look, we didn't steal the cars.

02:15.419 --> 02:18.538
The charge isn't theft.
It's trafficking in stolen merchandise.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.211
How much time?

02:20.358 --> 02:22.393
Well, neither of you have serious records.

02:22.394 --> 02:24.054
You both have a drunk and disorderly.

02:24.055 --> 02:26.223
Billy, you've got the two
petty theft convictions.

02:26.224 --> 02:30.386
- You have two petty theft convictions?
- Baby, it's not like you're a saint either.

02:30.421 --> 02:33.001
- Remember where we met.
- Nice.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.949
I'm sorry.

02:34.950 --> 02:37.841
Look, I think I can make a deal.

02:37.876 --> 02:40.398
Plead guilty to the trafficking charges.

02:40.433 --> 02:42.424
I can get you off the
hook on the tax evasion,

02:42.425 --> 02:44.068
The accessory to grand theft auto.

02:44.069 --> 02:46.998
If I can get you that deal,

02:47.033 --> 02:49.731
You're looking at about one to five years.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.252
Julie taylor, you come on in here, girl!

03:05.286 --> 03:07.387
- Mrs. Saracen, how are you?
- It's so good to see you.

03:07.422 --> 03:09.456
Oh, it's good to see you.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.991
Um, I can't stay long.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.960
I just came over to see if you wanted a ride

03:12.994 --> 03:15.529
To thanksgiving at our house
since shelby's out of town.

03:15.563 --> 03:18.699
Well, no, 'cause matthew's
got that rental car,

03:18.733 --> 03:20.767
And we'll just come over
there in that, darlin'.

03:20.802 --> 03:23.704
- Matt's in chicago.
- Oh...Well-but-

03:23.738 --> 03:25.739
You know what, honey,

03:25.773 --> 03:29.142
Why don't I make that
leek and onion casserole.

03:29.177 --> 03:31.178
I think I've got the recipe.

03:31.212 --> 03:35.716
It's actually better than it sounds.

03:39.087 --> 03:41.021
Friday night, you're gonna be challenged

03:41.055 --> 03:43.790
Like you have never been challenged before.

03:43.825 --> 03:46.126
The question flying around town is,

03:46.160 --> 03:49.896
Can the dillon panthers be beat?

03:49.931 --> 03:51.198
Do we have the resources they have?

03:51.232 --> 03:53.033
Do we have the booster dollars they have,

03:53.067 --> 03:54.868
The experience they have? No, we don't.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.503
Are we playing on their field? Yes, we are.

03:56.537 --> 04:00.140
However, there's more than
one way to skin a cat.

04:00.174 --> 04:03.510
- Hut, hike!
- Can you all count that high?

04:03.544 --> 04:05.245
Preparation, preparation, preparation.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.914
We are gonna stack our strengths
up against their weaknesses.

04:07.949 --> 04:09.650
'cause I'm gonna tell you something.

04:09.684 --> 04:12.319
The dillon panthers are
over on the west side

04:12.353 --> 04:13.987
Preparing for their thanksgiving feast,

04:14.022 --> 04:16.822
Getting their little fancy soirees together,

04:16.858 --> 04:19.926
Dreaming about their playoff win

04:19.961 --> 04:22.696
And their state championship title.

04:23.230 --> 04:26.065
Well, by god, we're gonna
be on this field right here,

04:26.100 --> 04:28.401
Physically and mentally
preparing for one thing

04:28.436 --> 04:29.536
And one thing only,

04:29.570 --> 04:31.738
And that is beating the dillon panthers.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.573
listen to me. Listen to me!

04:33.608 --> 04:35.408
You look around at each other.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.876
Right now, you look at each other

04:36.911 --> 04:38.378
And you ask yourselves,
gentlemen, 'cause it is time-

04:38.412 --> 04:40.914
What kind of a man am I?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.916
Because Friday night-

04:42.950 --> 04:46.386
Friday night there will be a bond formed

04:46.420 --> 04:50.590
Between and among you
that will never be broken.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.559
I will not be proven wrong on that.

04:52.593 --> 04:56.529
Do I think that we can
beat the dillon panthers?

04:56.564 --> 04:59.532
I don't think we can
beat the dillon panthers.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.768
I know damn well we can
beat the dillon panthers.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.603
<i>The question is, do you think that</i>

05:03.638 --> 05:05.605
We can beat the dillon panthers?

05:06.641 --> 05:08.742
Then show me.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.266
- I want to apologize- I want to apologize

06:06.300 --> 06:11.004
For all those who were hurt-

06:11.038 --> 06:14.774
I want to apologize for
all those who were hurt

06:14.809 --> 06:18.144
And for all those who were offended.

06:18.179 --> 06:21.214
I sincerely regret any damage

06:21.248 --> 06:23.283
This has caused the community-

06:23.317 --> 06:25.118
Honey, no. Don't stand there.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.887
It's bad enough having
to read this gibberish

06:27.922 --> 06:30.690
Witht having to do it in front of you.

06:30.725 --> 06:33.727
You're gonna get through this.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.863
- Am I?
- Mm-hmm.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.698
Should I?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.140
I'll get through it.

06:48.843 --> 06:51.377
You want a cup of coffee?

06:51.412 --> 06:52.746
Thank you.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.190
Hey.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.325
Hey, landry.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.728
I have in my right hand

07:08.762 --> 07:14.967
A brand new crucifictorious fou
r-track demo. Rough.

07:15.002 --> 07:19.005
Contain yourself, please. This is huge.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.107
I want you to listen to it,

07:21.141 --> 07:25.911
And I want you to try to figure out
Which one of these songs is for you.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.747
i>- A song for jess?

07:27.781 --> 07:30.650
Yeah, all the other names I
came up with sounded corny.

07:30.684 --> 07:35.855
So that's just, like, a temporary...Name.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.156
What?

07:37.190 --> 07:39.292
You really hate crucifictorious?

07:39.326 --> 07:40.726
No, landry.

07:40.761 --> 07:45.331
- the other night, we...
- What?

07:45.365 --> 07:50.670
Um... I have feelings for vince.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.379
I'm sorry.

08:14.695 --> 08:18.664
Oh, so the area I live in is called,
like, "greek town."

08:18.699 --> 08:22.335
So there's, like,
just a lot of greek people around.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.804
Oh, I live above a coffee shop too.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.872
So it always smells like coffee a lot.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.809
And when I'm going up the
stairs to go into my apartment,

08:29.843 --> 08:31.711
I get, like, a caffeine high.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.913
You can't get a caffeine
high from smelling coffee.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.246
It's physically impossible.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.749
No, it's 'cause I don't drink coffee,

08:36.783 --> 08:39.818
- So I probably have a low tolerance.
- That doesn't even make any sense.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.419
Do I want yellow or white onions?

08:41.455 --> 08:44.190
white.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.593
Hey, hey.

08:49.396 --> 08:52.932
I miss you.

08:53.101 --> 08:55.134
A lot.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.674
You know, most people say goo
d-bye to their girlfriends,

09:01.708 --> 09:04.677
Or tell them where they're
going...Or something.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.513
I had to get out of here.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.148
If I tried to say good-bye to you,

09:09.182 --> 09:12.017
I never would have left.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.956
Well, your apartment sounds real nice.

09:16.990 --> 09:21.127
Well... Do you want to see it?

09:21.161 --> 09:24.830
'cause I kinda already bought you a ticket.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.337
Let's get some work done, boy.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.706
Let's do this. - Hey, vince.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.375
- What's up, man?
- Hey, man, I just wanted to-

09:36.410 --> 09:38.310
To thank you for letting me know that

09:38.345 --> 09:40.212
You thought that jess and
I were so good together,

09:40.247 --> 09:43.382
And I was such a good guy and everything.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.784
Jess told me.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.886
It wasn't-it wasn't
supposed to happen like that.

09:46.920 --> 09:51.657
It's good to know that
your word means a lot.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.265
She'll be out.
She should be here any time.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.666
You told here to be here
at this time, right?

10:00.700 --> 10:03.903
She just turned the corner? She's here?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.838
Okay, let's get this started.

10:05.872 --> 10:09.074
All right, could I have
everyone's attention?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.976
We appreciate you coming here today

10:11.011 --> 10:13.512
For this special meeting.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.047
And I'll tell you what, let's just-

10:15.081 --> 10:16.215
Let's just get this under way.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.818
At this time, principal
tami taylor would like

10:18.852 --> 10:20.019
To make a statement.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.955
Principal taylor?

10:29.599 --> 10:31.421
Good afternoon.

10:44.964 --> 10:48.047
Listen, y'all...

10:48.081 --> 10:50.416
I've always put the welfare of the students

10:50.450 --> 10:53.619
Ahead of everything else.

10:53.653 --> 10:57.289
Every action that I made
was with that intent,

10:57.324 --> 11:00.459
And it always will be.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.795
And that's all I have to say. Thank y'all.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.302
All right, everyone,
we would like to move on

11:10.337 --> 11:11.437
To our next item on the agenda.

11:11.471 --> 11:12.605
Where is the apology?

11:12.639 --> 11:15.407
They told me she would apologize.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.010
That is not an apology. I want her fired!

11:21.892 --> 11:24.035
They're offering me full scholarship.

11:24.070 --> 11:26.611
And that's a good program.
Saint pat's is a good program.

11:26.646 --> 11:28.321
And they, um-

11:28.356 --> 11:30.727
They might even make it to state this year.

11:30.762 --> 11:33.143
So it's something I gotta
really think about.

11:36.382 --> 11:38.638
Why are you telling me this?

11:40.910 --> 11:43.769
Just want you to know I might transfer,

11:43.804 --> 11:46.124
And that I didn't want you
to hear it from someone else.

11:46.159 --> 11:47.872
Okay.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.325
Okay.

12:00.390 --> 12:02.975
Is that-is that really all
you're gonna say, coach?

12:03.228 --> 12:05.831
What would you have me say?

12:05.866 --> 12:08.615
Anything-something about how
you'd like me to stay here

12:08.650 --> 12:10.137
And not move on to another program,
I don't know.

12:10.172 --> 12:11.665
How about something
about how you get injured

12:11.700 --> 12:13.280
And you don't tell a
damn person around here?

12:13.315 --> 12:15.893
'cause, you know what,
otherwise you might be playing Friday.

12:15.928 --> 12:18.056
Isn't that the case? - Yeah.

12:18.091 --> 12:19.375
But you didn't tell a damn soul,

12:19.410 --> 12:21.674
So you sort of took it out
of our hands, didn't you?

12:21.709 --> 12:23.454
Yes, sir. And I apologize for that.

12:23.489 --> 12:25.875
Well, you know what,
Then why don't we talk about saint pat's

12:25.910 --> 12:27.436
When the season's over?

12:27.471 --> 12:30.466
Coach, you gotta let me play on Friday.

12:30.501 --> 12:32.545
You know what,
I'll tell you something, luke.

12:33.113 --> 12:35.875
You're gonna suit up,
but you are not gonna be playing.

12:38.770 --> 12:41.482
You're not gonna be playing.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.002
Hi.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.207
What's-what's up?

12:56.242 --> 12:58.433
Can I help you?

12:58.434 --> 13:01.444
- Uh, yeah, I was- I was in town,

13:01.445 --> 13:03.901
So I just wanted to stop by and say hey.

13:03.976 --> 13:06.967
- Well, hey.
- hey.

13:07.597 --> 13:08.983
What's going on?

13:08.984 --> 13:13.355
That's nice for you to think
about your old friend landry.

13:13.356 --> 13:14.928
Yeah.

13:14.929 --> 13:18.449
You know what else might
have been nice, matt?

13:18.484 --> 13:18.822
What?

13:18.823 --> 13:21.652
Maybe if I would have just
gotten one quick phone call

13:21.653 --> 13:23.027
From my best friend.

13:23.028 --> 13:25.428
Or maybe if I would have
just gotten a quick text.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.221
- Right. Um...
- Since you left,

13:27.222 --> 13:28.754
I've been dumped by a beautiful girl.

13:28.755 --> 13:30.581
We've got this big game against
the panthers coming up,

13:30.582 --> 13:31.283
And I'm the kicker,

13:31.284 --> 13:33.037
So that's a lot of pressure to begin with,

13:33.038 --> 13:34.687
But I have it in my head
that I'm gonna choke.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.245
Which, if it's in my head
that I'm gonna choke,

13:36.246 --> 13:37.915
That probably means that I'm gonna choke.

13:37.916 --> 13:39.987
- You don't need to-
- And if you really want to see,

13:39.988 --> 13:41.749
You know, you could stick
around for the game.

13:41.750 --> 13:45.924
But I'm sure that would be asking
way too much For you to do.

13:48.805 --> 13:50.900
He's like a girl.

14:00.093 --> 14:02.628
Hey, I forgot to mention to you, uh,

14:02.662 --> 14:05.064
Buddy's coming to dinner tomorrow.

14:05.098 --> 14:06.365
Buddy garrity?

14:06.399 --> 14:08.801
Yeah.

14:09.409 --> 14:12.780
Well, he can't come to dinner, all right?

14:12.781 --> 14:14.128
Angela collette's gonna be here.

14:14.129 --> 14:16.108
He's gonna try to flirt with her.

14:16.549 --> 14:18.010
Well, he's coming.

14:18.044 --> 14:19.211
He's gonna bring a turkey.

14:19.246 --> 14:22.014
Well, honey, why is he bringing a turkey?

14:22.048 --> 14:23.549
I've got a turkey. I'm making a turkey.

14:23.550 --> 14:26.385
He's gonna bring his fryer with him too.

14:26.419 --> 14:28.654
Buddy garrity is bringing a deep fryer

14:28.688 --> 14:31.457
To my house for thanksgiving
and cooking a turkey

14:31.491 --> 14:33.626
When I'm making dinner?

14:33.660 --> 14:35.728
- Yeah.
- Does that make any sense?

14:35.762 --> 14:38.063
It makes just as much sense buddy
being here As angela collette.

14:38.098 --> 14:39.365
Well, none of it makes any sense.

14:39.399 --> 14:42.034
I mean, we've now got the collettes coming,
We've got the riggins' coming.

14:42.068 --> 14:43.102
Now I got a houseful of people.

14:43.136 --> 14:44.370
Well, buddy's lonely, you know...

14:44.404 --> 14:46.639
I know, what's one more? It's fine.

14:46.673 --> 14:48.440
- It's thanksgiving.
- All I want to do is just

14:48.475 --> 14:49.975
Crawl into a corner.

14:57.217 --> 14:58.717
And what happens at this meeting?

14:58.752 --> 14:59.952
I don't know.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.854
They're not telling me one single thing.

15:01.888 --> 15:02.988
They didn't say anything?

15:02.989 --> 15:07.559
All I know is that we're having a meeting.

15:07.594 --> 15:09.028
I'm having a meeting with the school board

15:09.062 --> 15:11.163
And the superintendent on Saturday.

15:11.197 --> 15:14.867
Nobody's telling me anything at this point.

15:14.901 --> 15:17.002
Could be a firing meeting.

15:22.275 --> 15:24.109
All right.

15:24.144 --> 15:28.814
Honey, I know I went there
intending to apologize,

15:28.848 --> 15:30.916
And I just- I just couldn't do it.

15:30.950 --> 15:32.551
I'm sorry, I just couldn't do it.

15:32.585 --> 15:34.486
You don't have to say you're sorry.

15:34.521 --> 15:36.789
There's no reason to say you're sorry.

15:39.159 --> 15:40.392
This whole situation's screwed.

15:40.427 --> 15:42.828
I mean, it's screwed. You know?

15:42.862 --> 15:44.196
There's a part of me that
just wants to get in the car

15:44.230 --> 15:46.165
And get the hell out of dodge, you know.

15:46.199 --> 15:48.133
I mean, this is penny-ante stuff;
it's not like

15:48.168 --> 15:49.735
They're gonna chase us
across state lines for it.

15:49.769 --> 15:50.936
But I got a baby- I can't just, like,

15:50.970 --> 15:52.604
Pack up and go, you know?

15:52.639 --> 15:53.939
And I don't blame you, tim. I don't.

15:53.973 --> 15:55.407
I mean, this isn't on you.

15:55.442 --> 15:56.809
I mean, even though that
guy at the wrecking yard

15:56.843 --> 15:58.911
Kinda identified you, I mean,
it's not your fault.

15:58.945 --> 16:00.145
I'm the one who got you into this.

16:00.180 --> 16:01.747
Granted, I wouldn't have
taken the cars there,

16:01.781 --> 16:04.271
Like, 15 times, but it's not your fault.

16:04.884 --> 16:08.153
Who the hell's that?

16:10.423 --> 16:12.758
It's for you. - Who is it?

16:12.792 --> 16:15.494
Stevie, did you poop?

16:15.528 --> 16:17.963
Becky, it's a little late, don't you think?

16:17.997 --> 16:20.132
Sorry, billy.

16:22.802 --> 16:24.770
You poop yourself? Mindy?

16:27.941 --> 16:28.907
Hey.

16:28.942 --> 16:31.410
I heard what happened.

16:34.247 --> 16:36.382
Is it true?

16:39.119 --> 16:43.489
You're a liar, tim.

16:43.523 --> 16:45.924
All that stuff you said about
turning your life around,

16:45.959 --> 16:49.294
About being a man...

16:49.329 --> 16:51.363
You can't even look me in
the eyes right now, tim.

16:51.398 --> 16:53.365
You're a coward.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.533
And I believed you.

16:54.567 --> 16:56.802
I believed every word of it. So good job.

16:59.806 --> 17:01.273
My mom was right.

17:01.307 --> 17:03.075
You're just like every other guy,

17:03.109 --> 17:06.178
And I gave you too much credit.

17:06.212 --> 17:07.880
My mistake.

17:29.587 --> 17:31.915
Folks, it is turkey day,
and here in dillon

17:31.950 --> 17:33.377
We're following up thanksgiving

17:33.412 --> 17:35.776
With a little Friday night rivalry game

17:35.811 --> 17:38.003
Between east and west dillon.

17:38.038 --> 17:40.677
It's a must-win for the
panthers to get to the playoffs.

17:40.712 --> 17:43.357
And for the lions, this is about pride-

17:43.392 --> 17:46.216
Not so much keeping it, but finding it.

17:46.574 --> 17:48.775
Ready...Hut!

17:48.810 --> 17:50.305
Come off the ball, dale.

17:50.340 --> 17:52.182
Hey, what are you slowing down for?

17:52.217 --> 17:54.628
Practice isn't over, gentlemen, let's go!

17:54.663 --> 17:57.306
26 power pass. Let's do it again.

17:57.673 --> 17:59.444
He's gotta give 'em a day off.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.447
Hey, coach, what'd you say over there?

18:01.482 --> 18:04.139
- It's thanksgiving.
- No, it's practice.

18:04.174 --> 18:05.606
Let's go, all right, defense! Run!

18:05.641 --> 18:08.745
What'd I say about putting your hands
up And getting in there after him?

18:09.072 --> 18:11.742
I told you to get your arms in
the air when you're doing that.

18:11.743 --> 18:13.286
Let's do it! - Hey, eric,

18:13.321 --> 18:15.325
You can drive this home
tomorrow in pre-game.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.990
You know what, coach,
why don't you have coach traub

18:17.025 --> 18:19.378
Drive you home if you're so
excited to get out of here?

18:19.702 --> 18:21.330
Hut!

18:21.687 --> 18:24.827
Get in there! Get after it,
tinker! Get after it! There you go.

18:25.213 --> 18:27.242
Hey, everybody, say good-bye to tinker.

18:27.277 --> 18:29.037
Tinker, get out of here. - Whoo!

18:29.072 --> 18:30.360
All right, fellas,

18:30.361 --> 18:33.226
I'm gonna go oink on me Some
big ol' fat, juicy turkey!

18:33.261 --> 18:35.336
All right, that's good. You can go now.

18:35.371 --> 18:37.612
Hey, have a good one.

18:37.647 --> 18:39.844
Let's go. Hut.

18:40.172 --> 18:42.241
Linebackers, get out of here.

18:42.276 --> 18:44.440
Get off before he changes his mind.

18:44.475 --> 18:47.617
Receivers, defensive backs,
you want to go home?

18:47.800 --> 18:51.188
Landry, get out of here.
Have a good thanksgiving.

18:51.223 --> 18:52.415
Happy thanksgiving.

18:52.450 --> 18:54.439
Just leave 'em. Go home.

18:54.824 --> 18:57.315
Happy thanksgiving to all of you.

18:58.326 --> 19:00.400
Have a good one.

19:04.376 --> 19:06.450
Their corners are gonna be aggressive.

19:06.485 --> 19:08.626
Gonna be shifting a lot, you know.

19:11.268 --> 19:12.575
All right.

19:13.174 --> 19:14.639
Coach...

19:17.241 --> 19:18.800
Can I do this?

19:20.538 --> 19:22.231
Can you do what?

19:23.758 --> 19:26.023
I know how bad you want this.

19:26.058 --> 19:29.173
I can feel it-how bad
you want to beat dillon.

19:30.635 --> 19:33.089
I don't think I'm the guy
that can give it to you.

19:35.814 --> 19:38.158
You got somewhere to be tonight?

19:38.193 --> 19:40.675
Yeah, I'm eating dinner with my mom.

19:41.288 --> 19:43.677
You sure about that?

19:43.712 --> 19:46.118
Yeah, coach.

19:47.358 --> 19:49.575
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.

19:51.104 --> 19:53.412
- You got it?
- I got it.

19:56.913 --> 19:59.578
Their weak-side corner tends
to ignore The backside post.

19:59.613 --> 20:02.001
You know that, don't you? - Yes, sir.

20:03.326 --> 20:05.816
All right, hot gravy, y'all.

20:05.851 --> 20:06.715
- Good.
- Good.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.797
And for you, tim,
more of those rolls, nice and warm.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.052
Mm-hmm. All right, now,
does anybody need anything?

20:12.087 --> 20:14.773
You've done everything.
Just sit down and eat.

20:14.808 --> 20:16.795
Tami, this turkey, now, I don't think

20:16.830 --> 20:19.224
I've ever tasted any turkey
like it-it's amazing.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.266
Thank you so much.

20:20.301 --> 20:22.139
You know, that's actuall
y- that's the deep fried.

20:22.174 --> 20:24.615
That's buddy's turkey.
There are two turkeys?

20:25.132 --> 20:27.424
- And this is deep fried?
- It's deep fried.

20:27.459 --> 20:30.633
Well, I wonder why everybody
Doesn't deep fry their turkey then.

20:30.668 --> 20:32.040
It's so good.

20:32.475 --> 20:36.460
I think it's labor-inten- But no,
it is- it's delicious.

20:36.495 --> 20:38.842
Well, he's handsome and he can cook.

20:38.877 --> 20:40.708
I think that's fantastic.

20:40.743 --> 20:43.149
You think we're ever gonna get
to sit at the big kid table?

20:44.113 --> 20:45.944
Um, probably not. But on the plus side,

20:45.979 --> 20:47.855
We have the whole bowl of
cranberry to ourselves.

20:47.890 --> 20:50.617
Yes. That is a lot of cranberry sauce.

20:50.652 --> 20:51.698
You drop the entire
turkey down in the grease,

20:51.733 --> 20:55.157
And it seals all the moisture in the turkey.

20:55.192 --> 20:56.940
- Juicy.
- Yeah.

20:56.975 --> 20:59.925
Mine's a natural one, you know.
We went to the turkey farm.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.874
And anyway, it's just roasted, that's all.

21:04.866 --> 21:09.377
- Well, sorry-
- I'd like to make a toast.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.726
Sorry to interrupt everyone
in the middle of eating,

21:12.761 --> 21:16.429
But, um, I just- I wanted to say that

21:16.464 --> 21:20.663
Thanksgiving is- it's not all about turkeys

21:20.698 --> 21:24.471
And gravy and cranberries
and all that stuff.

21:27.051 --> 21:29.748
Um, it's about those brief
moments on this earth

21:29.783 --> 21:32.497
That we get to spend with each other,

21:34.130 --> 21:37.275
And to realltake those
moments in, to feel them.

21:39.086 --> 21:41.335
Because one of these
days it'll all be gone...

21:42.610 --> 21:46.024
And we'll be as dead as
that fried turkey there.

21:46.059 --> 21:49.992
So I just want to say thank
you to my friends, my family,

21:50.904 --> 21:54.930
My beautiful wife... My son...

21:54.965 --> 21:58.512
Who seems to talk as much as I like to.

22:00.323 --> 22:04.363
And I don't know what I'd be without y'all.

22:04.398 --> 22:07.385
And to, uh...To tim.

22:07.420 --> 22:10.532
I mean, hell, man, we-

22:11.075 --> 22:13.606
We've been together since before time.

22:14.380 --> 22:18.196
I don't always tell you this,
but I love you.

22:19.209 --> 22:22.511
You've always been there for me,
And, uh...Yeah.

22:25.783 --> 22:27.977
Sorry to interrupt everybody's dinner.

22:28.012 --> 22:31.526
Tami, coach, thank you for
having us In your beautiful home.

22:33.134 --> 22:35.109
I'm done talking.

22:35.144 --> 22:36.039
- Amen.
- Thank you, guys.

22:36.074 --> 22:38.169
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Cheers, gracie.

22:40.469 --> 22:42.557
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Happy thanksgiving.

22:42.592 --> 22:45.109
Thanks for letting me come over.

22:45.144 --> 22:47.342
Now, this is some good food.

22:47.377 --> 22:50.080
Mm, you make sure to thank
the merriweathers, all right?

22:50.115 --> 22:51.811
Definitely will.

22:53.089 --> 22:55.090
You ready for the game tomorrow?

22:57.666 --> 22:59.507
There's gonna be a lot of people there...

23:00.288 --> 23:01.949
Watching me.

23:02.448 --> 23:05.477
Reporters waiting for me to mess up.

23:06.040 --> 23:08.163
Trying to find out what's wrong with me.

23:08.198 --> 23:10.310
There ain't nothing wrong with you.

23:10.345 --> 23:12.811
I know, it's just a
lot riding on this game.

23:12.846 --> 23:14.398
I've been working really hard at it,

23:14.433 --> 23:17.219
This football thing, sticking with it.

23:17.551 --> 23:20.114
I just don't want to let anybody down.

23:20.149 --> 23:23.264
You won't let anybody down. Okay?

23:25.288 --> 23:27.271
Well, look who's here.

23:27.306 --> 23:30.348
So I see y'all are just
eating all the food without me.

23:31.162 --> 23:33.109
Couldn't wait. - You made some pie.

23:33.144 --> 23:35.689
Yes. It's the best pie
in texas, thank you.

23:35.724 --> 23:37.313
And he forgot it.

23:37.348 --> 23:39.979
- I got short-term memory sometimes.

23:40.014 --> 23:41.580
Oh, my god, did you make that or aunt bird?

23:41.615 --> 23:44.815
Because if you touched it, I don't
know if I could let my mom eat that.

23:44.850 --> 23:46.284
You know what, that is the nicest thing-

23:46.319 --> 23:48.673
I made it. My aunt bird made it too.

23:49.457 --> 23:50.498
what kind of pie?

23:50.533 --> 23:52.313
- Pecan pie.
- Oh, my favorite.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.980
- Look at that-beautiful.
- Beautiful is right.

23:56.151 --> 23:58.123
Mmm! - Come on, let's eat this pie.

24:12.429 --> 24:14.096
- One minute.
- You shouldn't be here.

24:14.130 --> 24:18.967
One minute...Please.

24:22.806 --> 24:25.274
- What's going on?
- Becks, I know you should be,

24:25.308 --> 24:28.544
And you deserve to be angry,
pissed off, upset.

24:28.578 --> 24:30.345
And I'm not here to argue that.

24:30.380 --> 24:33.949
I want you to be my friend, becks.

24:33.983 --> 24:37.286
And you being my friend means
you're part of my family.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.221
Tim, I barely know your family.

24:39.255 --> 24:42.091
- I know, it's
-I know.

24:42.125 --> 24:43.759
And I know you have your mom.

24:43.793 --> 24:46.862
And if she's not around,
and if I can't be there,

24:46.896 --> 24:49.331
I want you to know that if you need anything

24:49.365 --> 24:51.100
At any time,

24:51.134 --> 24:53.435
I promise you that they will be there.

24:53.470 --> 24:56.572
Where are you going?

24:59.008 --> 25:02.945
Promise me that you'll give me a
second chance To earn back your trust.

25:07.684 --> 25:09.051
I promise.

25:15.058 --> 25:17.426
This is-

25:17.460 --> 25:19.394
I want you to hold on to that.

25:19.429 --> 25:25.634
Um, I will be back to get
that when the time is right.

25:51.528 --> 25:54.129
What are you thinking about?

25:57.467 --> 26:02.137
I'm thinking about...

26:02.172 --> 26:05.107
What happens if I get fired?

26:07.544 --> 26:10.112
- Mm
-mm. Don't do that.

26:12.215 --> 26:14.917
What that'll do to our family.

27:22.118 --> 27:23.518
Hey, coach. It's time.

27:23.553 --> 27:26.188
Let's go. Let's go! Let's go!

27:33.997 --> 27:36.198
Willie, what a night
for high school football.

27:36.232 --> 27:38.500
I haven't seen a crowd as big as thi
s-I don't know when.

27:38.534 --> 27:42.037
It's blue versus red.
Beautiful night in west texas.

27:42.071 --> 27:44.039
It's rivalry week.
This town is ready for it.

27:44.073 --> 27:45.807
I'm ready. Let's play some football.

27:45.842 --> 27:49.011
Here we go. J.D. Mccoy over center.

27:49.045 --> 27:50.912
Steps back, looks across the middle.

27:50.947 --> 27:54.349
Fires...

27:54.384 --> 27:56.585
Oh, he's got dansby at the 40!

27:56.619 --> 27:58.453
One man to beat. Here he goes, folks.

27:58.488 --> 28:02.124
Oh, my! Touchdown!

28:02.158 --> 28:04.459
And just like that, coach taylor is down

28:04.494 --> 28:07.396
And he is climbing the mountain.

28:07.430 --> 28:09.765
Come on, coach, let's go!

28:09.799 --> 28:12.334
Hey, vince,

28:12.368 --> 28:14.936
I'm gonna enjoy watching you
beat them all night long.

28:21.744 --> 28:24.046
Vince howard dropping back.

28:24.080 --> 28:25.781
Pressure coming from the outside.

28:25.815 --> 28:27.182
Oh, he's got a little space.

28:27.216 --> 28:28.917
Come on, yeah!

28:28.951 --> 28:30.619
Beautiful cut to the outside.

28:30.653 --> 28:31.920
Vince howard to the edge.

28:31.954 --> 28:33.822
Oh, my! He's gonna take it to the house.

28:33.856 --> 28:37.092
Touchdown, lions. Coach taylor has answered.

28:37.126 --> 28:40.028
And this game is all tied up, folks.

28:42.565 --> 28:46.568
Landry clarke lining up for the point after.

28:46.602 --> 28:49.771
Here's the snap. It's down.

28:49.806 --> 28:52.941
<i>It's up and-oh, shank you very much!</i>

28:52.975 --> 28:56.244
Wide left. That wasn't even close.

28:56.279 --> 28:57.412
Looks like landry clarke just got

28:57.447 --> 28:58.480
A little jittery on that one.

28:58.514 --> 29:00.349
Panthers back on the attack.

29:00.383 --> 29:03.885
Mccoy fires a beautiful fade route.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.421
He's got a man... Touchdown panthers!

29:06.456 --> 29:08.590
And dillon is back on top.

29:08.624 --> 29:09.991
Late in the second quarter,

29:10.026 --> 29:12.160
Mccoy fires a sweet skinny route.

29:12.195 --> 29:15.597
Sanders has it at the goal line, touchdown!

29:15.631 --> 29:16.765
And the panthers are really starting

29:16.799 --> 29:17.933
To stretch this thing out.

29:17.967 --> 29:20.068
Coach taylor may be in trouble.

29:20.103 --> 29:22.270
Come here! Come here! Listen up.

29:22.305 --> 29:24.172
Double tight, wing left. Start under center.

29:24.207 --> 29:26.808
Shift to gun, and you release to tinker.

29:26.843 --> 29:29.478
Tinker? You want to throw the bal
l-is that even legal?

29:29.512 --> 29:31.546
We're gonna find out if you
can get the ball to him or not.

29:31.581 --> 29:33.315
- Yes, sir.
- All right, let's go then.

29:33.349 --> 29:36.051
Let's go!

29:36.085 --> 29:37.986
Here come the lions.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.654
Coach taylor trying to claw
his way back into this one.

29:39.689 --> 29:43.725
Here's howard with a play-action,
looking deep.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.327
Nice little head fake.

29:45.361 --> 29:48.430
Howard let's it fly.

29:48.464 --> 29:50.165
Oh, my! Look at this, folks.

29:50.199 --> 29:52.567
Tinker, taylor, soldier, football.

29:52.602 --> 29:53.335
Tinker's got the end zone. Touchdown lions!

29:59.542 --> 30:01.276
Looks like coach taylor is
going for two here, folks.

30:01.310 --> 30:03.445
Not a lot of confidence in his kicking game

30:03.479 --> 30:07.149
After landry clarke sent that
last one into the other county.

30:07.183 --> 30:09.184
A little speed draw from howard.

30:09.218 --> 30:11.753
Up the middle, dives forward. Two points!

30:11.788 --> 30:13.188
He's done it!

30:13.222 --> 30:16.324
The lions are right back
in this thing, folks.

30:20.663 --> 30:24.166
Let's go, baby. Let's go, baby!

30:27.970 --> 30:30.839
I want you to rattle mccoy.

30:30.873 --> 30:34.342
I'm gonna get you the rock.
I'm gonna get you the ball.

30:34.377 --> 30:36.978
- Guys...
- Take his head off, all right?

30:37.013 --> 30:39.781
- Keep it up!
- Tinker, hey!

30:39.816 --> 30:42.451
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen up.

30:42.485 --> 30:43.819
defense! Defense!

30:43.853 --> 30:46.955
See this?

30:46.989 --> 30:50.192
- Defense! Defense!
- Mm...

30:52.728 --> 30:55.497
Yeah.

30:55.531 --> 30:57.866
We been working hard, fellas. What are we?

30:57.900 --> 31:00.068
- Lions!
- What do we play with?

31:00.102 --> 31:01.503
- Heart!
- What do we play for?

31:01.537 --> 31:02.571
Pride!

31:02.605 --> 31:03.772
- What are we?
- Lions!

31:03.806 --> 31:05.106
Let's do this! One, two, three...

31:05.141 --> 31:07.342
Lions!

31:07.376 --> 31:08.710
Here we go.

31:08.744 --> 31:10.679
They're really putting
some pressure on him.

31:10.713 --> 31:12.080
They've got two guys coming off the edge.

31:12.114 --> 31:14.416
There they go. They're into mccoy's face.

31:14.450 --> 31:17.085
Oh, big sack for the lions.

31:19.088 --> 31:21.256
You were in there all day long.

31:21.290 --> 31:22.757
Get in there and do it right!

31:22.792 --> 31:24.259
Get in there!

31:24.293 --> 31:26.194
Linebackers in the "a" gap.

31:26.229 --> 31:27.829
There's a blitz coming off the edge.

31:27.864 --> 31:29.197
More pressure for mccoy!

31:29.232 --> 31:31.733
Oh, and he throws it into the dirt.

31:34.036 --> 31:35.370
Come on!

31:35.404 --> 31:37.239
Mccoy's not happy at all after he gets up.

31:37.273 --> 31:38.740
He's really mad at his offensive line.

31:38.774 --> 31:41.209
Boy, I tell you what,
that kid's got a temper,

31:41.244 --> 31:43.111
And it is really coming out right now.

31:43.145 --> 31:46.081
What are you doing?

31:46.115 --> 31:50.552
Luke! You warmed up?

31:50.586 --> 31:51.786
Yes, sir, I am.

31:51.821 --> 31:53.588
- Do you feel all right?
- Yes, sir, I feel great.

31:58.060 --> 32:01.129
- Vince.
- What's up, coach?

32:01.163 --> 32:02.964
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

32:02.999 --> 32:07.536
We're gonna run the lion. You got it?

32:07.570 --> 32:08.770
And, howard... - Yes, sir.

32:08.804 --> 32:09.771
Make the read.

32:09.805 --> 32:11.072
You got it? - Yes, sir.

32:11.107 --> 32:13.408
Yes. - Thank you.

32:13.442 --> 32:14.743
And looky here, folks,

32:14.777 --> 32:17.445
Number 44 is on the gridiron.

32:17.480 --> 32:20.482
Coach taylor has brought
luke cafferty into the game.

32:20.516 --> 32:23.285
A sweep to the outside.
Cafferty's up the line!

32:23.319 --> 32:27.422
Here we go! Oh, big gain for cafferty.

32:27.456 --> 32:28.723
First down lions!

32:31.761 --> 32:33.395
Howard under center.

32:33.429 --> 32:35.730
A little play-action.
He's looking downfield.

32:35.765 --> 32:37.766
He's got cafferty on a crossing route,

32:37.800 --> 32:41.069
Wide open in the end zon
e- touchdown cafferty!

32:41.103 --> 32:42.437
The lions are back in this!

32:42.471 --> 32:44.673
If you got a towel, folks, hold onto this.

32:44.707 --> 32:45.941
This here's about to get good.

32:50.947 --> 32:55.483
And it looks like coach taylor
is going for two points again,

32:55.518 --> 32:56.851
Trying to make it a thre
e-point game, I guess.

32:56.886 --> 32:59.321
No love for landry clarke.

32:59.355 --> 33:01.289
And here we go, let's see what they've got.

33:01.324 --> 33:03.191
Here's the play.

33:03.225 --> 33:05.660
Cafferty, power play right into the heart

33:05.695 --> 33:07.762
Of that panther defense.

33:07.797 --> 33:08.930
Oh, my, and the lions are pushing the pile.

33:08.965 --> 33:13.435
Cafferty takes it in!

33:13.469 --> 33:16.671
He's got it! Two points, east dillon lions!

33:16.706 --> 33:19.541
Hold on, folks, we got ourselves

33:19.575 --> 33:20.875
An old-fashioned barn burner.

33:20.910 --> 33:22.277
Coach taylor is knocking on the door.

33:22.311 --> 33:23.511
Let's go. Good job, boys.

33:23.546 --> 33:25.180
We're right back in it.

33:25.214 --> 33:28.283
And coach taylor's got
these lions believing, folks.

33:28.317 --> 33:29.551
Let's go!

33:29.585 --> 33:32.687
Howard in shotgun. There's the snap.

33:32.722 --> 33:34.956
Looks to be a-no, it's a little shuttle pass

33:34.991 --> 33:35.991
To cafferty.

33:36.025 --> 33:37.225
He's got some room!

33:37.259 --> 33:39.361
Oh, my, he could go!

33:39.395 --> 33:41.663
Oh, mercy!

33:41.719 --> 33:47.133
***

33:47.134 --> 33:50.189
Let me tell you, folks.
Luke Caffery is one tough dude,

33:50.190 --> 33:52.558
but he is not getting up.

33:53.129 --> 33:54.844
Luke, you're alright?

33:54.879 --> 33:57.538
Come on, I got you.

34:01.194 --> 34:03.116
It's alright.

34:03.117 --> 34:05.320
Time! Time!

34:05.354 --> 34:06.521
- We got him.
- You all right?

34:06.555 --> 34:07.656
Just give me one second.

34:07.690 --> 34:10.257
I can go back in, coach.
Give me just one second.

34:10.292 --> 34:11.525
Offense, right here. Here we go.

34:11.560 --> 34:15.929
Landry! Where's my kicker?

34:15.965 --> 34:18.199
Landry!

34:18.234 --> 34:20.268
You're going in.

34:20.302 --> 34:22.771
- That would be a 45-yard field goal.

34:22.804 --> 34:24.005
- So?
- I can't kick a-

34:24.040 --> 34:25.739
i>- What do you mean you can't?

34:25.775 --> 34:27.208
- I can't kick-
- what do you mean you can't?

34:27.243 --> 34:28.710
You know what, I spent three years

34:28.744 --> 34:30.178
Turning you into a football player.

34:30.212 --> 34:31.746
You know what you're gonna d
o- you're gonna go out there

34:31.781 --> 34:33.014
And you're gonna kick that damn field goal.

34:33.049 --> 34:34.149
Do you hear me?

34:34.183 --> 34:35.717
And you know what, it could be worse, son.

34:35.751 --> 34:38.987
It could be 47 yards. So do us proud.

34:39.021 --> 34:41.322
Get in there. Let's go. Let's go, let's go!

34:41.357 --> 34:44.125
Six seconds left, and it looks like

34:44.159 --> 34:45.960
He's bringing out the kicking team.

34:45.995 --> 34:47.896
Landry is gonna try a 46-yarder.

34:48.181 --> 34:51.339
***

34:51.491 --> 34:52.713
Against the wind.

34:52.714 --> 34:55.786
If it's good, the lions win this game.

35:10.019 --> 35:12.921
Set! Hut!

35:33.409 --> 35:34.476
It's good!

35:34.510 --> 35:36.444
Oh, my!

35:36.479 --> 35:40.582
East dillon has defeated
the dillon panthers.

35:40.616 --> 35:43.451
Oh, my goodness, that is
one for the history books.

35:43.486 --> 35:45.053
Coach taylor has done it.

35:45.087 --> 35:50.091
East dillon high and their kicker,
landry clarke,

35:50.126 --> 35:51.926
Have put this game away.

35:51.961 --> 35:55.063
Hallelujah, east dillon...!

36:10.713 --> 36:13.748
I'm proud of you.

36:15.885 --> 36:16.918
Yeah!

36:24.326 --> 36:26.628
I just don't know how to feel.

36:26.662 --> 36:29.063
I'm a man conflicted.

36:29.098 --> 36:32.333
I went in knowing that a
panther loss would mean

36:32.368 --> 36:35.336
The end of the football season for dillon.

36:35.371 --> 36:36.671
But seeing those lions-

36:36.705 --> 36:40.241
Their guts, their determination,

36:40.276 --> 36:42.377
Coach taylor's leadership-

36:42.411 --> 36:44.379
Golly me, by the end of the game

36:44.413 --> 36:47.749
I think I was becoming a damn lions fan!

36:47.783 --> 36:50.151
Well, dillon, this is it.

36:50.186 --> 36:56.925
This is me, sammy meade,
signing off Until next season.

36:56.959 --> 36:59.494
I'm sorry. It's not in my hands.

36:59.528 --> 37:01.596
The board voted on it, and we've decided

37:01.630 --> 37:03.064
To put you on administrative leave.

37:03.098 --> 37:04.999
- Administrative leave?
- Right.

37:05.034 --> 37:06.835
That just means you'll take some time off,

37:06.869 --> 37:08.136
You'll get paid,

37:08.170 --> 37:09.571
And we'll revisit it in six months.

37:09.605 --> 37:12.173
Tami, make no mistake,
this gentleman is firing you.

37:12.208 --> 37:13.374
- No, sir, I am not firing her.
- This is what they do.

37:13.409 --> 37:14.843
They suspend you with pay,
then they tell you

37:14.877 --> 37:16.911
You've lost your effectiveness,
and then they dismiss you.

37:16.946 --> 37:19.948
She was trying to help a kid
who came to her for advice.

37:19.982 --> 37:21.382
That's what she does- she helps kids.

37:21.417 --> 37:22.784
This is what the board wants.

37:22.818 --> 37:23.952
Well, then, we're in
for a fight, aren't we?

37:23.986 --> 37:26.621
A lawsuit could potentially cost
us Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

37:26.655 --> 37:28.356
Oh, it'll be big, and it'll be costly.

37:28.390 --> 37:30.725
We don't care. - Actually, I do care.

37:30.759 --> 37:33.928
I care very much. I do.

37:33.963 --> 37:36.197
I'll tell you what, paul,
this whole situation

37:36.232 --> 37:37.732
Has been horrible.

37:37.766 --> 37:40.869
I believe it is wrong what
y'all have put me through.

37:40.903 --> 37:43.438
And what I'd like to do is
I'd like to make it right.

37:43.472 --> 37:46.207
That's the only thing I'm
interested in here at this point.

37:46.242 --> 37:47.876
So what are you saying?

37:47.910 --> 37:52.513
What I'm saying is I'd
like to go where I'm needed.

37:52.548 --> 37:58.152
And I would give up being
principal of west dillon high

37:58.187 --> 37:59.854
If I could go over there

37:59.889 --> 38:03.725
And head up the counseling
program at east dillon.

38:03.759 --> 38:06.427
Principal taylor, is that what you want?

38:08.264 --> 38:12.133
I think that's what I want, yeah.

38:12.167 --> 38:14.235
So why are we here, matthew?

38:14.270 --> 38:16.571
Because this is a special spot.

38:16.605 --> 38:19.874
Because you deflowered me here?

38:19.909 --> 38:23.244
Well, I wouldn't use
those words necessarily.

38:23.279 --> 38:25.346
But yeah.

38:25.381 --> 38:27.582
you're such a nerd.

38:27.616 --> 38:29.450
It is special.

38:33.188 --> 38:36.758
You're a hard person to stay mad at.

38:40.829 --> 38:44.666
I am sorry about the way I left.

38:48.137 --> 38:50.104
I can't go to chicago, matt.

38:50.139 --> 38:52.273
Because it's not just a weekend.

38:52.308 --> 38:55.710
It's-it's a lot longer.

38:55.744 --> 38:59.547
I'm gonna go, and I'm gonna
fall in love with the city...

38:59.581 --> 39:00.782
And the neighborhood,

39:00.816 --> 39:04.385
And the way your hallway smells like coffee

39:04.420 --> 39:07.689
When you get home at night.

39:07.723 --> 39:12.060
You'll be there...

39:12.094 --> 39:16.097
And I'll never follow my dreams.

39:16.131 --> 39:20.268
And as much as I love you...

39:20.302 --> 39:22.503
I need to find my own chicago.

39:31.547 --> 39:35.283
- Hey.
- So strong.

39:35.317 --> 39:37.452
You're the strongest, aren't you?

39:37.486 --> 39:38.720
Get his feet.

39:38.754 --> 39:40.321
He's kicking his feet. He's a runner.

39:40.356 --> 39:41.789
Yeah, daddy.

39:41.824 --> 39:46.160
Look at him. Run those feet.

39:54.103 --> 39:55.303
Hey, guys.

39:55.337 --> 39:57.538
- Hey.
- What's up?

39:57.573 --> 40:01.576
Can I steal billy for a sec, minds?

40:01.610 --> 40:04.645
Oh, it was my first break ever.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.714
I won't be long. I promise.

40:06.749 --> 40:08.182
Okay? - Mm-hmm.

40:08.217 --> 40:10.918
I'll be back in a second.
I'll see you, buddy.

40:17.526 --> 40:19.027
What's up, man?

40:32.007 --> 40:32.974
I did it.

40:33.008 --> 40:35.376
I did it all.

40:35.411 --> 40:36.477
What are you talking about?

40:36.512 --> 40:38.946
You did not do anything.

40:38.981 --> 40:43.217
When we closed the shop, I re-opened it.

40:43.252 --> 40:46.487
You had no idea this was happening.

40:46.522 --> 40:47.889
Timmy, I can't let you do that.

40:47.923 --> 40:50.825
I stripped the cars. I took the money.

40:52.061 --> 40:57.432
I took the frames to the junkyard.

40:57.466 --> 41:00.068
I can't let you do that.

41:00.102 --> 41:03.905
You're my brother.

41:03.939 --> 41:06.240
You're all I have.

41:06.275 --> 41:11.079
You have a family now. You are a father.

41:11.113 --> 41:15.716
And you need to be one.

41:15.751 --> 41:18.086
I can't let-

41:18.120 --> 41:22.090
This is...My decision.

41:22.124 --> 41:25.393
This is what I've decided.

41:25.427 --> 41:28.429
This is what's gonna happen.

41:28.464 --> 41:30.031
- I'm sorry.
- You're my brother.

41:32.601 --> 41:34.936
I'm so sorry.

41:46.448 --> 41:47.648
Hi.

41:47.683 --> 41:49.917
Oh, whatever.

41:51.520 --> 41:55.389
Hey, landry. I'm sorry, okay?

41:55.424 --> 41:57.592
I should have called you from chicago.

41:57.626 --> 42:00.394
Or before I left or something but...

42:02.664 --> 42:04.499
Julie just broke up with me, all right,

42:04.533 --> 42:07.502
So I was kinda-

42:07.536 --> 42:10.738
It'd be nice if we could
be friends again, please.

42:10.772 --> 42:13.741
Okay, man. Did you see my field goal?

42:13.775 --> 42:16.344
Yes, I saw your field goal.

42:16.378 --> 42:19.113
- A 72-yard field goal.
- It actually wasn't.

42:19.148 --> 42:20.715
I was there, I saw it. It wasn't 72 yards.

42:20.749 --> 42:22.517
It was really close. It was a miracle.

42:22.551 --> 42:24.252
<i>- It was a miracle.
- You want a coke or something?</i>

42:24.286 --> 42:26.854
Sure.

42:26.889 --> 42:29.323
Um, so is julie gonna take that ticket?

42:29.358 --> 42:32.560
I don't know.

42:32.594 --> 42:35.263
Maybe I'll give it to grandma or something.

42:35.297 --> 42:36.998
You're gonna give your ticket to grandma,

42:37.032 --> 42:38.599
And grandma's gonna be running around

42:38.634 --> 42:40.701
All over chicago?

42:40.736 --> 42:44.639
Yeah. Why not?

43:03.225 --> 43:05.860
All right.

43:39.761 --> 43:42.129
You're gonna be a christmas tree.

43:42.164 --> 43:43.965
Whoo, whoo, whoo! A christmas tree!

43:46.435 --> 43:49.570
Here, grace. Decorating.

43:49.605 --> 43:51.272
Here. Decorate.

43:56.979 --> 43:58.079
Hey, y'all.

43:58.113 --> 44:00.047
- How you doing?
- Hey.

44:00.082 --> 44:02.116
Doing all right.

44:02.150 --> 44:03.884
Good.

44:03.919 --> 44:05.653
How are y'all?

44:05.687 --> 44:08.923
Look at my girl. What do you have?
