- Well, congratulations, lemon.

18:50.906 --> 18:52.123
You were right.

18:52.158 --> 18:53.308
I've been lying to myself.

18:53.342 --> 18:55.410
Maybe my whole marriage
to avery was a lie.

Okay, so we agree.
Things are complicated.

Lemon...

19:13.696 --> 19:15.814
We can't make this movie.
- Yes, we can.

hotshot at boinking.

20:09.485 --> 20:11.369
She boinks like a dog.

20:11.420 --> 20:12.754
I'm not a writer.

20:12.788 --> 20:14.422

her this morning

20:29.505 --> 20:31.606
Hopefully, the next time
we see each other,

20:31.640 --> 20:34.559

Can my name be the first credit
