WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.279
HEY, AVERY,
CHECK THIS OUT.

00:08.279 --> 00:10.781
I GOT YOUR MOM THIS LAST-MINUTE
CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR TOMORROW.

00:10.781 --> 00:13.013
IT'S A PHONE CASE
FLY ZAPPER.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.416
THIS PART HERE
ZAPS THE FLIES.

00:15.416 --> 00:18.419
GOOD IDEA. GIVE MOM A CHEAP,
UNROMANTIC GIFT

00:18.419 --> 00:20.251
THAT SHE CAN LITERALLY
ZAP YOU WITH.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.094
PLUS, KNOWING YOUR MOTHER,

00:23.094 --> 00:24.595
SHE'D HOLD IT BACKWARDS
AND ZAP HERSELF.

00:24.595 --> 00:26.757
( zapping )
AH! OH!

00:26.757 --> 00:28.599
WOW, THIS IS A REALLY
BAD INVENTION.

00:28.599 --> 00:30.461
WHO WOULD BUY THIS?

00:30.461 --> 00:31.502
OH.

00:31.502 --> 00:33.534
Bennett: HEY, HON.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.765
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

00:35.806 --> 00:37.308
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE.

00:37.308 --> 00:39.340
IT'S--IT'S MY SISTER.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.272
OH, NO. DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN TO HER?

00:41.272 --> 00:44.075
APPARENTLY SHE WAS ON THE FIRST
LEG OF HER HOLIDAY TRIP AND--

00:45.076 --> 00:46.217
I CAN'T EVEN SAY IT.

00:46.217 --> 00:47.478
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:48.479 --> 00:49.650
HER CONNECTING
FLIGHT TO HAWAII

00:49.650 --> 00:50.721
HAS BEEN DELAYED SIX HOURS,

00:50.721 --> 00:52.553
SO SHE WANTS
TO COME VISIT.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.585
OH, MY GOSH.

00:54.585 --> 00:56.757
ELLEN, I AM SO SORRY.
MMM.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.560
LISTEN--WE WILL
GET THROUGH THIS SOMEHOW.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.392
YOU ALWAYS THINK SHE'S
GONNA VISIT SOMEBODY ELSE--

01:01.392 --> 01:02.563
NEVER YOU.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.764
YEAH.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.566
WHAT'S SO BAD
ABOUT AUNT SIGOURNEY?

01:05.566 --> 01:06.767
I BARELY KNOW HER.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.068
I'VE KIND OF
MADE AN EFFORT

01:08.068 --> 01:09.300
TO KEEP HER OUT OF MY LIFE.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.471
HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN ANYONE

01:10.471 --> 01:12.143
WHO WAS JUST BETTER THAN YOU
AT EVERYTHING?

01:12.143 --> 01:14.305
NO. HONESTLY,
IT'S HARD TO EVEN PICTURE.

01:15.676 --> 01:16.607
IT WOULDN'T BE SO BAD

01:16.607 --> 01:18.349
IF SHE WEREN'T
SO SNARKY ABOUT IT.

01:18.349 --> 01:19.510
THE FIRST TIME SHE SAW YOU,

01:19.510 --> 01:21.512
SHE SAID YOU LOOKED LIKE
A CAPUCHIN MONKEY.

01:21.512 --> 01:23.454
I HAD TO PROTECT YOU
FROM HEARING THAT.

01:23.454 --> 01:25.456
AND YET YOU DIDN'T.

01:25.456 --> 01:27.518
HER LIFE
IS JUST SO TOGETHER

01:27.518 --> 01:29.520
AND PERFECT,
ESPECIALLY COMPARED

01:29.520 --> 01:32.092
TO HER PLAIN, OLD,
ORDINARY BIG SISTER.

01:33.264 --> 01:34.495
NO ONE'S GONNA JUMP IN

01:34.495 --> 01:35.766
AND SAY, "YOU'RE NOT
PLAIN AND ORDINARY"?

01:35.766 --> 01:37.298
OH, YOU'RE NOT PLAIN.
YOU'RE NOT ORDINARY.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.529
TOO LATE!

01:38.529 --> 01:40.171
EVERY TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER,

01:40.171 --> 01:41.632
SHE ZEROES IN ON HOW

01:41.632 --> 01:43.234
I'M A BAD HOUSEKEEPER,

01:43.234 --> 01:44.805
UNSOPHISTICATED,

01:44.805 --> 01:46.337
UNWORLDLY.

01:46.337 --> 01:47.638
JUMP IN ANY TIME.

01:47.638 --> 01:49.140
I'M PURPOSELY
SPEAKING SLOWLY

01:49.140 --> 01:50.441
TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE.

01:51.742 --> 01:54.285
YOU'RE NOT WORLDLY.
THE HOUSE IS A LITTLE
CLUTTERED.

01:54.285 --> 01:55.286
TOO LATE!

01:56.287 --> 01:58.189
POINT IS...
SHE PICKS ON EVERYTHING

01:58.189 --> 01:59.550
THAT'S WRONG WITH ME
UNTIL I CRY.

01:59.550 --> 02:00.591
IT'S LIKE A SPORT TO HER,

02:00.591 --> 02:02.423
AND MAKING ME CRY
IS HOW SHE WINS.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.754
AND NOW SHE'LL BE VISITING US,

02:03.754 --> 02:05.456
AND THAT LEAVES ME
ONE OPTION!

02:05.456 --> 02:06.697
THAT'S RIGHT!
YOU CAN RESOLVE

02:06.697 --> 02:09.460
THAT THIS YEAR, YOU ARE NOT
GONNA LET HER GET TO YOU!

02:09.460 --> 02:12.163
YOU ARE GONNA BE PROUD
OF YOUR LIFE AND WHO YOU ARE.

02:12.163 --> 02:13.604
OKAY, I HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

02:13.604 --> 02:15.566
AND YOURS IS PROBABLY
SETTING A BETTER EXAMPLE

02:15.566 --> 02:17.768
THAN JUMPING
IN THE CAR AND DRIVING
TILL I RUN OUT OF GAS.

02:17.768 --> 02:20.441
EVEN IF YOU HAD
JUMPED IN THE CAR,
YOU COULD'VE STOPPED FOR GAS.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.573
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
THE POINT--
THERE'S LIKE A DOZEN STATIONS--

02:22.573 --> 02:24.615
MOM!

02:24.615 --> 02:26.647
MAYBE THIS YEAR
CAN BE DIFFERENT.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.549
MAYBE THIS YEAR,
YOU WON'T CRY

02:28.549 --> 02:29.550
AND YOU CAN WIN.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.652
IT'S NOT ABOUT TRYING TO WIN.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.554
IT'S ABOUT ACCEPTING
THAT FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS--

02:33.554 --> 02:35.586
QUIET, BENNET.
AVERY'S TELLING ME
I CAN WIN.

02:35.586 --> 02:38.158
AND HOW EXACTLY WOULD
THAT WORK SWEETIE?

02:38.158 --> 02:41.262
YOU CAN GET THROUGH
THE FEW HOURS THAT SHE'S
HERE WITHOUT CRYING.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.364
I MEAN, IT WOULD BE
LIKE A MARATHON RUNNER
FINISHING A RACE.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.637
LIKE A BOXER GOING
THE DISTANCE.
BUT I DON'T LIKE RUNNING,

02:46.637 --> 02:48.369
PUNCHING, OR BEING
CRITICIZED BY MY SISTER.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.940
THEY ALL MAKE ME CRY.

02:49.940 --> 02:52.343
THEN WE WON'T GIVE HER
ANYTHING TO CRITICIZE.

02:52.343 --> 02:54.545
SHE'LL SEE US HAVING
A PERFECT CHRISTMAS.

02:54.545 --> 02:56.547
I CAN HELP YOU
PULL THIS OFF, MOM.

02:56.547 --> 02:58.679
IT'LL BE MY CHRISTMAS
GIFT TO YOU.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.411
OH, THANK YOU AVERY.
THAT'S SO SWEET.

03:00.411 --> 03:02.383
IT IS SWEETER THAN
THE HUG BUCKS I GET

03:02.383 --> 03:04.655
EVERY YEAR FROM TYLER.

03:04.655 --> 03:07.658
MOM, WE CAN DO THIS.
ALL WE HAVE TO DO

03:07.658 --> 03:09.720
IS MAKE SURE THERE
ARE NO SURPRISES.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.293
COME ON IN, SPARKY.
I COULDN'T LET A STRAY,

03:12.293 --> 03:15.696
HIGH-STRUNG, UNTRAINED
DOG SPEND CHRISTMAS OUT
ON THE STREET.

03:17.628 --> 03:20.301
Stan: SO, SPARKY IS HERE
FOR CHRISTMAS.

03:20.301 --> 03:24.405
MY FIRST CHRISTMAS HERE LAST
YEAR MEANT SO MUCH TO ME.

03:24.405 --> 03:27.578
I JUST WANT TO GIVE THAT GIFT
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

03:27.578 --> 03:31.542
OKAY, SPARKY.
NOW PRESS SEND.

03:31.542 --> 03:34.545
ARE YOU NOT DOING IT BECAUSE
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,

03:34.545 --> 03:36.987
OR BECAUSE YOU DON'T
THINK IT'S GOOD ENOUGH?

03:40.551 --> 03:43.754
DELETE. WELL,
THAT COULDN'T BE CLEARER.

03:43.754 --> 03:45.696
OR MORE HURTFUL.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.617
COME ON PEOPLE.
AUNT SIGOURNEY

04:06.617 --> 04:08.549
WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE
AND WE'VE GOT A LOT TO DO

04:08.549 --> 04:10.721
TO MAKE CHRISTMAS
LOOK PERFECT.

04:10.721 --> 04:14.655
NO, CHLOE, YOUR HOMEMADE HOT DOG
ORNAMENT IS EXTRA-SPECIAL,

04:14.655 --> 04:17.728
SO IT GOES ON THE BACK OF
THE TREE SO IT WON'T BREAK.

04:17.728 --> 04:19.590
THAT'S BELIEVABLE.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.993
SOME FOURTH-GRADERS ARE TEACHING
ME SARCASM.

04:22.993 --> 04:25.396
IT'S WHERE YOU SAY ONE THING
BUT MEAN THE OPPOSITE.

04:25.396 --> 04:27.838
YOU ARE SUCH A SMART GIRL.

04:27.838 --> 04:30.571
THAT MEANS A LOT
COMING FROM YOU.

04:31.572 --> 04:32.703
CHLOE!

04:32.703 --> 04:34.405
NO, I REALLY MEANT THAT.

04:34.405 --> 04:36.607
WOW, SARCASM REALLY
HAS A HOLD OF ME.

04:38.349 --> 04:41.682
TYLER, WHAT ARE CHLOE'S DOLLS
DOING IN SANTA'S VILLAGE?

04:41.682 --> 04:43.784
BECAUSE THE SANTA I BELIEVE
IN IS A PLAYER.

04:43.784 --> 04:47.017
HE KNOWS WHO'S NAUGHTY
OR NICE.

04:47.017 --> 04:48.689
ALL RIGHT. FOR THE NEXT
TWO HOURS,

04:48.689 --> 04:51.362
I NEED TO STOP HAVING TO GIVE
REASONS FOR THINGS.

04:51.362 --> 04:53.464
WHATEVER IT IS, JUST TRUST
THAT I THOUGHT IT THROUGH

04:53.464 --> 04:54.525
AND THAT I'M RIGHT.

04:54.525 --> 04:55.526
HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT
FROM ANY OTHER DAY?

04:55.526 --> 04:56.927
IT SHOULDN'T BE.

04:56.927 --> 04:59.370
AND IF THAT'S GONNA
BE YOUR ATTITUDE,

04:59.370 --> 05:00.671
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
BE A PART OF THIS.

05:00.671 --> 05:03.704
OOH, I CAN'T HELP
DECORATE FOR CHRISTMAS?

05:03.704 --> 05:06.036
I CAN'T FUSS OVER
WHAT ORNAMENT GOES WHERE?

05:06.036 --> 05:09.079
THIS IS A TEENAGE
BOY'S WORST NIGHTMARE!

05:10.681 --> 05:13.684
AVERY, TYLER'S REALLY UPSET.

05:13.684 --> 05:15.816
NO, HE ISN'T. I THOUGHT YOU
LEARNED SARCASM.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.620
I JUST SPEAK IT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.091
OKAY, AUNT SIGOURNEY'S
GOING TO BE HERE SOON.

05:21.091 --> 05:22.723
I JUST NEED SOME WAY
TO SNAP MYSELF

05:22.723 --> 05:24.324
OUT OF IT IF I START TO CRY.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.096
OH, I COULD STEP ON MY FOOT.

05:26.096 --> 05:27.728
( music starts playing )

05:29.930 --> 05:32.603
WHAT IS THAT?
I ACCIDENTLY ACTIVATED

05:32.603 --> 05:34.405
MY GOOD
KING WENCES-SOCKS.

05:34.405 --> 05:37.468
( laughing )

05:37.468 --> 05:39.339
OKAY, IF YOU DON'T WANT
HER TO CRITICIZE YOU,

05:39.339 --> 05:41.412
TAKE THOSE OFF IMMEDIATELY.

05:41.412 --> 05:43.774
AND IF YOU WANT TO
SNAP YOURSELF OUT OF CRYING,

05:43.774 --> 05:46.016
TRY THE GIFT DAD GOT YOU.
WHAT DOES THIS DO?

05:46.016 --> 05:48.649
AAH! OOH,
THAT'LL DO NICELY.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.656
SO THAT'S THE BATHROOM.
ALTHOUGH FOR SOME REASON

05:55.656 --> 06:00.391
THE PEOPLE ALL GO INSIDE
THE HOUSE. WHAT ANIMALS.

06:00.391 --> 06:02.693
DID YOU JUST TRACK
MUD IN HERE?

06:02.693 --> 06:05.636
WELL, THAT IS NOT GONNA HELP
ME GET THE KIDS ON BOARD.

06:05.636 --> 06:09.740
YOU BETTER WAIT HERE
WHILE I TELL THEM ABOUT YOU.
PRACTICE LOOKING CUTE.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.945
THAT'S NOT BAD,
BUT YOU GOTTA WORK
WITH YOUR PAWS.

06:14.945 --> 06:17.478
YOU'RE LEAVING A LOT
OF CUTE ON THE TABLE.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.979
THUSLY.

06:24.014 --> 06:28.058
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THE GINGERBREAD ORNAMENT
IS NOT MADE OF GINGERBREAD.

06:28.058 --> 06:29.720
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
BUT I HAVE A FEELING

06:29.720 --> 06:33.624
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO LEARN THAT LESSON
FOR MYSELF.

06:33.624 --> 06:35.666
LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO TELL YOU GUYS--

06:35.666 --> 06:37.498
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU, TOO:

06:37.498 --> 06:39.700
AUNT SIGOURNEY'S COMING
OVER AND AVERY'S ON ONE

06:39.700 --> 06:42.072
OF HER CRAZY MISSIONS
TO MAKE EVERYTHING PERFECT.

06:42.072 --> 06:43.834
LIKE I'M NOT
ALREADY PERFECT.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.178
STILL NOT GINGERBREAD,
BUT IT'S SOFTENING.

06:48.178 --> 06:50.110
ANYWAY, YOU MAY WANT
TO STEER CLEAR OF AVERY

06:50.110 --> 06:52.513
WITH ANY OF YOUR
LITTLE DOGGY SURPRISES.
WHOA.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.644
WAIT A MINUTE,
ARE YOU SAYING NO LITTLE

06:53.644 --> 06:55.886
SURPRISES FROM ME
AS A DOGGY,

06:55.886 --> 06:58.749
OR NO SURPRISES
INVOLVING A LITTLE DOGGY?

06:58.749 --> 07:01.822
'CAUSE THOSE ARE TWO
VERY DIFFERENT THINGS.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.924
BOTH, AND WHAT ARE YOU
EVEN TALKING ABOUT?

07:03.924 --> 07:06.426
( laughing )
WHO KNOWS?

07:06.426 --> 07:09.960
I JUST GOT INTO SOME
WEIRD TRASH OUT BACK.
I'M A LITTLE LOOPY.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.962
( makes loopy sounds )

07:15.566 --> 07:18.669
OKAY, NEW PLAN:
WE HIDE YOU OUT HERE
IN THE COAT CLOSET

07:18.669 --> 07:21.542
UNTIL AUNT SIGOURNEY'S GONE.
BUT DON'T WORRY,

07:21.542 --> 07:23.073
WE'LL MAKE IT NICE
AND CHRISTMASSY.

07:25.015 --> 07:27.047
( music starts playing )
Stan: VOILA!

07:28.118 --> 07:29.980
YOU WANT TO
SING SOME CAROLS?

07:29.980 --> 07:32.683
♪ DECK THE HALL CLOSET
WITH BOUGHS OF HOLLY ♪

07:32.683 --> 07:35.686
♪ FA-LA-LA-LA-LA

07:36.857 --> 07:40.691
OH, I'M SORRY,
I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASSUMED.

07:40.691 --> 07:42.563
( music changes )

07:42.563 --> 07:45.896
♪ O HANUKKAH, OH HANUKKAH ♪

07:45.896 --> 07:50.901

07:55.105 --> 07:56.677
WE'RE HOME!

07:56.677 --> 07:59.750
Stan: AUNT SIGOURNEY.
HYPER-CRITICAL, INSENSITIVE,

07:59.750 --> 08:04.114
AND BETTER THAN YOU. AND THAT'S
FROM HER ONLINE DATING PROFILE.

08:04.114 --> 08:05.816
SO I SAID TO THE FLIGHT
ATTENDANT,

08:05.816 --> 08:07.688
I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE
PREGNANT.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.020
WADDLE BACK TO THE GALLEY
AND WARM UP MY COOKIE.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.024
ANYONE?
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
SHE STARTS CRYING,

08:14.024 --> 08:16.697
WHICH MADE
HER EVEN SLOWER.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.198
PLEASE?

08:19.199 --> 08:22.102
SIG!
HI!

08:23.604 --> 08:27.277
YOU LOOK GREAT.
AND YOU...
LOOK AT YOU!

08:28.679 --> 08:32.713
AUNT SIGOURNEY, HI.
HI.

08:32.713 --> 08:33.744
MONKEY!

08:35.686 --> 08:38.889
AND ISN'T MY MOM'S
OUTFIT GREAT?
IT'S JUST LIKE YOURS.

08:38.889 --> 08:40.891
OH, THE KNOCK-OFFS
ARE OUT ALREADY?

08:43.554 --> 08:45.656
OOH, THAT'S THE STUFF.

08:45.656 --> 08:47.598
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD
REALLY TAKE OFF MY SHOES.

08:47.598 --> 08:49.099
OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE FLOOR.

08:49.099 --> 08:52.032
I'M NOT, I'M WORRIED
ABOUT MY SHOES.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.664
( yells )

08:53.664 --> 08:55.606
ARE YOU OKAY?

08:55.606 --> 08:58.068
I SLIPPED IN SOME MUD.

08:58.068 --> 08:59.810
IT WAS MY OWN FAULT.

08:59.810 --> 09:02.813
FOR ASSUMING THERE WOULDN'T
BE MUD ON YOUR KITCHEN FLOOR.

09:03.874 --> 09:05.545
BUT DON'T WORRY.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.649
I'M SURE YOU'RE FAR MORE
HUMILIATED THAN I AM HURT.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.653
( zapping )

09:14.625 --> 09:17.728
IF SHE LEAVES NOW
AND I DIDN'T CRY, I WIN, RIGHT?

09:17.728 --> 09:19.630
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?
BENNETT COULD DRIVE YOU

09:19.630 --> 09:21.692
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND
THEN OFF TO THE AIRPORT.

09:21.692 --> 09:23.864
PLEASE DON'T MAKE HIM.

09:23.864 --> 09:27.197
OH, I KNOW THAT FEELING.
WHEN MY BACK GOES OUT LIKE THIS,

09:27.197 --> 09:30.240
MY DOCTOR SAYS THAT I SHOULD
STAY OFF MY FEET.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.603
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CANCEL
HAWAII

09:32.603 --> 09:34.845
AND SPEND
THE NEXT THREE DAYS HERE.

09:34.845 --> 09:37.047
( laughing )

09:37.047 --> 09:39.650
MAN, THIS THING DRAINS
YOUR BATTERY.

09:45.616 --> 09:47.287
SEE, SIGOURNEY?
I PUT THIS ON WHEELS

09:47.287 --> 09:50.090
SO WE CAN PUSH YOU AROUND.
I MADE THIS JUST FOR YOU.

09:50.090 --> 09:54.024
IT'S MORE THAN
JUST A GURNEY,
IT'S A "SIG-GURNEY."

09:55.896 --> 09:59.800
YOU'RE FUNNY. THAT MUST BE WHY
YOU AND ELLEN GET ALONG SO WELL.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.202
SHE'S ALWAYS HAD THE SENSE
OF HUMOR.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.775
WELL, SHE HAD TO BECAUSE I HAD
THE LOOKS AND THE BRAINS.

10:05.776 --> 10:07.277
( groaning )

10:07.277 --> 10:08.739
NOPE, STILL CHARGING.

10:08.739 --> 10:09.910
AVERY, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
OUTSIDE FOR A MOMENT?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.747
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I WAS MENTALLY PREPARED

10:16.747 --> 10:20.250
NOT TO CRY FOR A FEW HOURS,
NOT THREE DAYS.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.023
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN HIDING FROM YOU:

10:23.023 --> 10:25.696
I CAN BE A LITTLE EMOTIONAL.

10:25.696 --> 10:29.629
YOU THINK YOU'VE
BEEN HIDING THAT? WOW.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.932
I CAN'T HOLD IT TOGETHER
FOR THREE DAYS, AVERY.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.735
YOU SAW HOW SHE
WAS IN THERE.
PUSHING MY BUTTONS,

10:34.735 --> 10:36.066
AND THEN ADDING
INSULT TO INJURY

10:36.066 --> 10:38.839
BY SLIPPING
IN THE MUD ON MY FLOOR.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.171
I'M SURE STAN TRACKED
THAT INTO THE HOUSE.

10:41.171 --> 10:43.674
I'LL MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T
MESS ANYTHING ELSE UP.

10:43.674 --> 10:46.246
I TOLD YOU MY
PRESENT IS TO MAKE
THINGS SO GREAT

10:46.246 --> 10:49.279
SHE'LL HAVE NOTHING
TO CRITICIZE,
AND YOU WON'T CRY.

10:49.279 --> 10:52.222
COME ON, SAY IT
WITH ME: WE WILL WIN.

10:52.222 --> 10:53.924
WE WILL WIN.
COME ON!

10:53.924 --> 10:56.126
SAY IT WITH ALL THAT
EMOTION YOU'RE FULL OF.

10:56.126 --> 10:58.929
THAT EMOTION
IS USUALLY NEGATIVE.
MOM!

10:58.929 --> 11:02.733
Both:
WE WILL WIN! WE WILL WIN!

11:02.733 --> 11:05.065
WE WILL WIN! WE WILL WIN!

11:06.897 --> 11:10.170
HOW CAN THEY BE CELEBRATING
WHEN I'M IN HERE INJURED?

11:10.170 --> 11:14.805
IT MAY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE
HAVING FUN, BUT THOSE
ARE JUMPS OF CONCERN.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.281
OH, SPLIT-LEVEL DOGHOUSE.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.854
YEAH, THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
BUT I COULD RENT OUT

11:23.854 --> 11:25.816
THE SECOND STORY.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.819
HE'S IN HERE.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.421
AVERY SENT US TO TALK
TO YOU.

11:31.421 --> 11:34.925
WHAT HAPPENED? I TOLD YOU AUNT
SIGOURNEY WAS COMING

11:34.925 --> 11:37.027
AND WE NEEDED EVERYTHING
TO BE PERFECT.

11:37.027 --> 11:38.769
THEN YOU TRACKED
MUD IN THE HOUSE!

11:38.769 --> 11:40.771
THAT'S RIGHT I DID IT.
NOBODY ELSE DID IT.

11:40.771 --> 11:43.904
NO OTHER DOG IN THIS HOUSE.
I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.106
THERE'S A SMALL DOG LICKING
MY HAUNCHES, ISN'T THERE?

11:48.979 --> 11:50.380
HE'S SO CUTE.

11:50.380 --> 11:51.942
WHERE DID HE COME FROM?

11:51.942 --> 11:54.885
I TOOK IN A STRAY FOR CHRISTMAS
AND HE GOT OUT.

11:54.885 --> 11:56.747
WHAT'S YOUR
NAME, LITTLE GUY?

11:56.747 --> 11:58.188
Stan:
MY NAME'S SPARKY.

11:58.188 --> 12:01.952
NAW, I'M JUST KIDDING,
HE DOESN'T TALK.

12:01.952 --> 12:03.453
LOOK, I'M SORRY HE TRACKED
IN THE MUD.

12:03.453 --> 12:05.455
PLEASE DON'T TELL
ANYBODY ABOUT HIM.

12:05.455 --> 12:06.827
THEY'LL NEVER LET HIM STAY

12:06.827 --> 12:08.458
WITH THIS WHOLE AUNT SIGOURNEY
THING GOING ON.

12:08.458 --> 12:11.231
WE CAN'T PUT HIM OUT
ALONE ON CHRISTMAS.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.034
THEN I GUESS WE HAVE
TO KEEP SPARKY A SECRET.

12:14.034 --> 12:17.237
IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD
FOR THE THREE OF US TO
KEEP AN EYE ON ONE LITTLE--

12:19.309 --> 12:21.041
SERIOUSLY?
DON'T FEEL BAD.

12:21.041 --> 12:24.114
I'VE LOST TONS OF LIZARDS
AND RATS AND SNAKES
IN THIS HOUSE.

12:24.114 --> 12:26.046
WHAT?
WHAT?

12:35.055 --> 12:38.188
MMM. MOM, THE COOKIES
TASTE GREAT,

12:38.188 --> 12:41.992
EVERYTHING LOOKS PERFECT.
AUNT SIGOURNEY WILL HAVE
NOTHING TO CRITICIZE.

12:41.992 --> 12:43.894
YOU WILL MAKE IT
THROUGH WITHOUT CRYING.

12:43.894 --> 12:46.466
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
YOU HELPING ME LIKE THIS.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.038
TEARS OF JOY STILL COUNT.

12:49.239 --> 12:51.041
HERE, IT'S FULLY CHARGED.

12:51.041 --> 12:54.344
( zapper buzzes )
OOH, YOU UPPED THE JUICE.

12:54.344 --> 12:56.947
HEY, DAD, WHY DON'T YOU BRING
AUNT SIGOURNEY IN HERE

12:56.947 --> 12:59.449
TO ENJOY THE WONDERFUL
CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS?

12:59.449 --> 13:02.452
Sigourney:
SO HE KEPT BEGGING,
"YOU'RE THE MOST FASCINATING,

13:02.452 --> 13:04.815
"BEAUTIFUL GIRL THAT
I'VE EVER MET.

13:04.815 --> 13:06.957
WOULD YOU GO TO THIS
THING WITH ME TONIGHT?"

13:06.957 --> 13:09.359
UNTIL FINALLY I SAID YES.

13:09.359 --> 13:10.520
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

13:10.520 --> 13:11.962
I WAS JUST TELLING HIM
ABOUT THE NIGHT THAT

13:11.962 --> 13:13.994
YOUR PROM DATE CAME
TO PICK YOU UP.

13:15.365 --> 13:17.567
HMM. SO, AUNT SIGOURNEY,
DO YOU LIKE THE WAY

13:17.567 --> 13:21.471
MY MOM DECORATED
FOR CHRISTMAS?
IT'S PRETTY PERFECT, HUH?

13:21.471 --> 13:23.173
IT'S VERY NICE.

13:23.173 --> 13:25.906
WAY TO GO, MOM,
YOU JUST WENT TO HER PROM!

13:27.337 --> 13:30.310
I ACTUALLY DID,
I CHAPERONED.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.513
HERE, AUNT SIGOURNEY, TRY
ONE OF THESE CHRISTMAS COOKIES.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.585
MY MOM MADE THEM.

13:35.585 --> 13:38.118
YES, YES, I DID.
I TOTALLY MADE THEM.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.150
WHAT KIND ARE THEY?
CHOCOLATE.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.552
GINGER-WAFER-
SNAP-DOODLES.

13:46.196 --> 13:47.998
I SAW SPARKY
COME THIS WAY.

13:47.998 --> 13:50.861
WE GOTTA FIND HIM
BEFORE THEY DO OR
THEY'LL KICK HIM OUT.

13:50.861 --> 13:53.964
GUYS, WE'VE BEEN ENTERTAINING
AUNT SIGOURNEY.

13:53.964 --> 13:55.265
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

13:55.265 --> 13:58.568
LOOKING FOR THE LITTLE DOG.
OUR LITTLE DOG. STAN.

13:58.568 --> 14:01.141
I CALLED HIM LITTLE
'CAUSE I'M PRACTICING

14:01.141 --> 14:02.272
FOR WHEN I GET BIGGER.

14:02.272 --> 14:04.114
I AM GONNA GROW.

14:05.375 --> 14:08.448
SHE'S NOT GETTING ANY SMALLER,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.520
SIG, YOU REMEMBER
THE KIDS FROM THE WEDDING.

14:10.520 --> 14:14.354
TAYLOR, CLEO,
HELLO.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.585
THOSE AREN'T OUR NAMES.

14:15.585 --> 14:17.527
THEN NO, NO.
I DON'T REMEMBER THEM.

14:22.332 --> 14:23.563
SPARKY!

14:23.563 --> 14:26.296
WHAT?
HAS MY SHOE BEEN CHEWED UP?

14:27.597 --> 14:29.339
SORRY.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.073
IS THIS BEHAVIOR NORMAL?

14:33.073 --> 14:38.078
WELL, IN CHILD PSYCHOLOGY
THERE IS NO "NORMAL" BEHAVIOR.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.549
BUT NO.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.588
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
OH, HERE,

14:48.588 --> 14:51.891
HAVE A TYLER HUG BUCK.
IN FACT, HAVE A FEW.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.194
YEAH,
I'M MAKING IT RAIN.

14:56.266 --> 14:57.998
WHO'S TYLER?

15:00.600 --> 15:03.003
OH!

15:03.003 --> 15:06.106
NO WONDER
LITTLE CLEO EATS SHOES.

15:08.939 --> 15:09.940
THERE!

15:13.613 --> 15:14.614
OVER THERE!

15:21.391 --> 15:25.495
ELLEN, THIS MUST BE SO
HUMILIATING FOR YOU.

15:31.261 --> 15:34.234
STAN, HOW COULD YOU BRING
A STRAY INTO THE HOUSE?

15:34.234 --> 15:36.136
AUNT SIGOURNEY COULD HAVE
BEEN SERIOUSLY,

15:36.136 --> 15:37.667
ALBEIT COMEDICALLY, HURT.

15:39.169 --> 15:40.940
SO COULD MY
HOT DOG ORNAMENT.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.313
THANKS, AVERY, FOR KEEPING IT
SAFE ON THE BACK OF THE TREE.

15:43.313 --> 15:44.614
IT'S LIKE YOU KNEW.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.078
IT'S CHRISTMAS.
I COULDN'T LEAVE SPARKY

15:48.078 --> 15:51.521
IN THE MERCILESS SUNNY
PASADENA WINTER.

15:51.521 --> 15:53.984
AVERY, DON'T MAKE HIM SPEND
CHRISTMAS ALL ALONE.

15:53.984 --> 15:56.586
YEAH. WE WERE GONNA HAVE OUR
OWN LITTLE CELEBRATION.

15:58.488 --> 16:00.390
WELL, THAT'S VERY
SWEET, STAN.

16:00.390 --> 16:02.392
I WAS LOOKING FOR A
SQUIRREL HEAD TREE TOPPER.

16:02.392 --> 16:06.566
BUT THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS,
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.500
AND NO ONE SHOULD SPEND
CHRISTMAS ALONE.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.503
BUT, SPARKY, YOU CAN'T STAY
ON THE LOOSE IN HERE.

16:13.503 --> 16:16.606
ALL RIGHT, SPARKY WILL
BE SAFE IN HERE
WITH ALL THE AIR HOLES

16:16.606 --> 16:18.578
AND WON'T BE ABLE TO
GET IN ANY MORE TROUBLE.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.711
WE'LL UNWRAP HIM AND
CELEBRATE WITH HIM ONCE
AUNT SIGOURNEY GOES TO BED.

16:24.114 --> 16:26.456
SHOULDN'T THIS BE
UNDER THE TREE?

16:27.657 --> 16:32.622
OH, IT'S ALL WET ON THE BOTTOM.

16:32.622 --> 16:35.395
AVERY MUST GOT ME THAT COLOGNE
GIFT SET I WANTED

16:35.395 --> 16:37.527
AND SOME OF IT'S LEAKING.
HMM.

16:43.533 --> 16:46.436
( sniffs )
MMM, MUSKY.

16:53.043 --> 16:54.684
ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE HANGING IN THERE.

16:54.684 --> 16:57.117
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU DIDN'T CRY
AFTER AUNT SIGOURNEY

16:57.117 --> 17:00.350
WAS HURLED VIOLENTLY,
ALBEIT COMEDICALLY,
INTO THE CHRISTMAS TREE.

17:01.591 --> 17:04.354
BUT IF THIS DINNER
GOES PERFECTLY,

17:04.354 --> 17:07.057
I KNOW WE CAN MAKE IT
THROUGH THIS WHOLE HOLIDAY.

17:07.057 --> 17:09.599
WELL, SHE SEEMS OKAY.
SHE'S HAVING FUN

17:09.599 --> 17:12.302
TELLING STORIES
ABOUT THE TIME
SHE STOLE YOUR HAIRCUT.

17:12.302 --> 17:14.364
SHE CUT OFF MY BANGS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

17:14.364 --> 17:16.706
AND GLUED THEM TO HER FOREHEAD.

17:16.706 --> 17:19.409
AND SHE LOOKED GOOD!

17:19.409 --> 17:22.742
WELL, THE WORST
IS BEHIND US.
MOM IS STILL STANDING.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.744
AND IT'S SMOOTH SAILING
FROM HERE ON,

17:24.744 --> 17:28.548
STARTING WITH THE CHRISTMAS
DINNER MOM "COOKED."

17:28.548 --> 17:29.679
( laughing )

17:29.679 --> 17:31.551
I'M JUST AMAZED YOU FOUND
A CATERER AT THE LAST MINUTE.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.623
ACTUALLY, I SET THIS UP
RIGHT AFTER THANKSGIVING.

17:33.623 --> 17:36.186
REALLY? WHEN?
LIKE RIGHT AFTER.

17:36.186 --> 17:39.129
WHILE WE WERE STILL
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

17:39.129 --> 17:41.691
WELL, THANK YOU. AND SORRY
AGAIN ABOUT THANKSGIVING.

17:41.691 --> 17:44.734
IT'S FINE.
IT'S BEHIND US.

17:44.734 --> 17:48.368
WELL, THERE'S NO WAY
AUNT SIGOURNEY COULD
CRITICIZE THIS DINNER.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.270
I KNOW. I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA CRY.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.103
IN FACT... DO YOU THINK...
NAW, FORGET IT.

17:53.103 --> 17:54.204
WHAT?

17:54.204 --> 17:56.646
MAYBE THIS TIME,
I COULD MAKE HER CRY.

17:56.646 --> 17:59.149
CHRISTMAS IS A TIME
OF MIRACLES.

17:59.149 --> 18:01.611
( laughing )

18:07.617 --> 18:09.819
ELLEN, THIS CARROT SOUP
IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.

18:09.819 --> 18:11.661
I'M GETTING A LOT OF FLAVOR.

18:11.661 --> 18:13.223
SOME OF IT
IS FROM THE PINE NEEDLES

18:13.223 --> 18:14.764
AND TREE SAP IN MY MOUTH,
BUT...

18:14.764 --> 18:16.826
I'M GETTING
A LITTLE CARROT, TOO.

18:16.826 --> 18:19.429
SO, KUDOS, REALLY.

18:20.530 --> 18:21.801
THANK YOU.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.204
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
I GOT A COMPLIMENT
OUT OF HER.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.735
IT WAS COUCHED
IN THREE INSULTS

18:25.735 --> 18:27.407
AND WAS FOR SOMETHING
I DIDN'T REALLY DO,
BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

18:28.678 --> 18:30.710
I'M TASTING THE PINE NEEDLES,
TOO.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.483
THAT'S BECAUSE MOM BUMPED INTO
THE TREE CARRYING THE SOUP

18:33.483 --> 18:37.517
TO THE TABLE.
SHE RUINED CATERED FOOD.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.250
SHHH! AUNT SIGOURNEY
DOESN'T KNOW.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.891
SHE LIKES IT.
JUST PULL THE PINE NEEDLES

18:41.891 --> 18:44.123
OUT OF YOUR SOUP
AND BE QUIET!

18:44.123 --> 18:46.296
OH, AND, THIS ISN'T A TOMATO.

18:47.657 --> 18:50.600
WHO'S READY FOR TURKEY?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.662
All:
OH!

18:52.662 --> 18:55.365
WAIT TILL YOU TASTE IT.
MOM MADE THE STUFFING

18:55.365 --> 18:57.867
FROM A RECIPE SHE CAME UP
WITH HERSELF ON THE FLY.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.909
MY SECRET IS TORN
BREAD AND LOVE.

18:59.909 --> 19:02.172
CORN BREAD AND LOVE.

19:03.613 --> 19:06.716
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
BEFORE THE MAIN COURSE
THAT...

19:06.716 --> 19:10.480
WELL, THIS FAMILY,
COMING TOGETHER
LIKE THIS ON CHRISTMAS,

19:10.480 --> 19:12.652
IT'S VERY...

19:12.652 --> 19:15.285
IT'S MOVING.
THANK YOU.

19:15.285 --> 19:17.857
NO, I MEAN IT'S MOVING!

19:17.857 --> 19:19.489
( all yelling )

19:25.395 --> 19:27.237
SPARKY!

19:27.237 --> 19:28.768
YOU KNOW THIS DOG?

19:28.768 --> 19:32.542
HE'S A STRAY.
AND IT WAS CHRISTMAS.

19:32.542 --> 19:36.175
ELLEN, THEY DID SAY YOU MADE
THE STUFFING. NOW I BELIEVE IT.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.807
( crying )

19:37.807 --> 19:41.611
MOM, NO, DON'T CRY.
YOU'VE COME TOO FAR.

19:41.611 --> 19:44.183
( laughing )

19:46.716 --> 19:49.589
WHAT IS SO FUNNY?
EVERYTHING'S BEEN AWFUL,

19:49.589 --> 19:52.362
DINNER IS RUINED...
I'M ALMOST CRYING.

19:52.362 --> 19:54.794
IT'S JUST SO FUNNY!

19:54.794 --> 19:57.527
US TRYING TO PRETEND WE
HAVE PERFECT CHRISTMASES.

19:57.527 --> 20:00.700
WE DON'T.
WE HAVE KIDS AND DOGS

20:00.700 --> 20:03.202
AND LAST-MINUTE SCRAMBLING,
AND...

20:03.202 --> 20:05.275
BENNETT WITH HIS CHEAP,
UNROMANTIC GIFTS

20:05.275 --> 20:07.637
AND MY AWFUL COOKING.

20:07.637 --> 20:09.809
CHRISTMAS AROUND HERE
IS A BIG LOUD MESS

20:09.809 --> 20:12.282
AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT IT.

20:12.282 --> 20:14.344
ANYWAY, WE MUST BE
DOING SOMETHING RIGHT,

20:14.344 --> 20:15.615
'CAUSE I'VE GOT KIDS
WHO WILL

20:15.615 --> 20:17.687
TAKE IN STRAY DOGS
FOR THE HOLIDAYS,

20:17.687 --> 20:19.919
BECAUSE NO ONE SHOULD
BE ALONE ON CHRISTMAS.

20:19.919 --> 20:23.523
AND A DAUGHTER WHO WILL
RUN HERSELF RAGGED

20:23.523 --> 20:25.325
JUST TO MAKE ME
FEEL LIKE A WINNER.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.799
WELL, I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHAT STAN AND SPARKY

20:29.799 --> 20:33.333
ARE HAVING FOR DINNER NOW,
SO WHO WANTS FROZEN PIZ--

20:33.333 --> 20:34.864
( sobbing )

20:37.006 --> 20:38.538
--ZZA.

20:39.669 --> 20:40.810
AUNT SIGOURNEY?

20:40.810 --> 20:42.342
SIG, WHAT'S WRONG?

20:42.342 --> 20:44.644
I'M A STRAY
DOG ON CHRISTMAS.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.547
I HAVE EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING!

20:47.547 --> 20:49.319
WHY DON'T I HAVE THIS?

20:49.319 --> 20:53.723
YOU WANT THIS?
MAYBE NOT ALL YEAR LONG,
BUT AT CHRISTMAS...

20:53.723 --> 20:58.328
WHY DO YOU THINK I PRETENDED
TO THROW MY BACK OUT?

20:58.328 --> 20:59.329
( gasping )

20:59.329 --> 21:00.460
YOU WERE FAKING?

21:00.460 --> 21:02.532
TO BE AROUND US?

21:02.532 --> 21:05.935
I TRY SO HARD TO MAKE
MY LIFE SPECIAL,

21:05.935 --> 21:09.499
MAYBE THE REASON THAT I HAVE
TO BE SO SPECIAL

21:09.499 --> 21:12.642
IS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
A FAMILY LIKE THIS.

21:15.044 --> 21:17.877
AUNT SIGOURNEY,
YOU DO.

21:21.311 --> 21:23.613
( crying )

21:26.916 --> 21:29.018
( cries louder )

21:30.560 --> 21:32.622
WE DID IT.
WE MADE HER CRY.

21:32.622 --> 21:34.394
MERRY CHRISTMAS, MOM.

21:38.628 --> 21:40.570
I DON'T LIKE TO PAT
MYSELF ON THE BACK,

21:40.570 --> 21:42.432
WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE
DOGS CAN'T PAT

21:42.432 --> 21:44.704
THEMSELVES ON THE BACK,
NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING

21:44.704 --> 21:47.407
ABOUT WHO-CAN-REACH-WHERE.

21:47.407 --> 21:50.880
BUT EVERYTHING ENDED UP
WORKING OUT GREAT.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.743
I WANTED TO GIVE SPARKY
A NICE CHRISTMAS

21:53.743 --> 21:56.746
AND I ENDED UP GIVING HIM
A LOT MORE THAN THAT--

21:56.746 --> 22:01.891
AUNT SIGOURNEY ADOPTED HIM.
AND RENAMED HIM SNARKY.

22:04.354 --> 22:07.096
IN FACT, EVERYONE GOT TO OPEN
A PRESENT THAT NIGHT.

22:14.864 --> 22:17.737
MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE.
