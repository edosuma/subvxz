10:53.354 --> 10:55.145
Investigators are currently on the scene

10:55.145 --> 10:57.045
of what appears to be homicide.

10:58.130 --> 11:01.340
Late last night, a man was

11:01.340 --> 11:03.090
and it wasn't until early this morning

The victim has been identified

11:11.840 --> 11:15.330

Eyewitness News, Oak Ridge.

Is Clara ready to go?

11:54.260 --> 11:56.060
- She's running late as usual.

11:56.060 --> 11:58.405
If you wanna come on in and
wait, she'll be ready in a few.

11:58.405 --> 11:59.430
- [Deja] Okay, cool.

12:00.910 --> 12:03.490

12:03.490 --> 12:04.970
Are you guys staying out of trouble?

12:04.970 --> 12:06.993
- Of course.
- Okay.

12:08.926 --> 12:10.310
Hey Deja, I just made some coffee.

12:10.310 --> 12:11.143
Did you want some?

12:11.143 --> 12:12.543
- No, I'm not a coffee person.

12:13.860 --> 12:14.693
- You know I drink so much coffee,

12:14.693 --> 12:18.393
my blood type is caffeine positive.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.998
- Good one. Mr. Banks.

12:21.832 --> 12:22.920
(clock ticks)

12:22.920 --> 12:25.280
- Hey Deja, I got to leave
would you do me a favor?

12:25.280 --> 12:26.290
Have Clara pick up

12:26.290 --> 12:28.480
some Halloween candy for me after school.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.903
- All right.
- Thank you.

12:29.903 --> 12:31.940
I got to leave and go
out of town for work,

12:31.940 --> 12:33.570
I know I'll forget.

12:33.570 --> 12:34.403
Thank you.

12:34.403 --> 12:36.093

13:54.161 --> 13:55.377
- What?

14:01.720 --> 14:04.070
What's this? I didn't
know you were into girls.

14:08.050 --> 14:10.580
- I'm not. I just borrowed some pictures

14:10.580 --> 14:12.580
from the nice ladies on the internet.

14:12.580 --> 14:14.150
- Okay...but for what though?

14:14.150 --> 14:15.980
And we were those people
we were talking to?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.940
Some of those messages were hella dirty.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.560
- It's just a game I play.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.780
- A game? That's no game I know of.

14:21.780 --> 14:22.933
- I made it up.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.280
I went onto one of those
lonely hearts sites

14:28.280 --> 14:29.993
and started messaging random guys.

14:30.930 --> 14:33.380
- So how do the pictures come into play?

14:33.380 --> 14:37.990
- Well, those women are who
they think they're talking to.

14:37.990 --> 14:39.780
- So you're catfishing guys?

14:39.780 --> 14:41.920
- Yeah! It's pretty great.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.010
I send them dirty pictures and messages

14:44.010 --> 14:46.790
and in return they send me free stuff.

14:46.790 --> 14:50.470
- They're sending you things?
They're buying you things?

14:50.470 --> 14:55.160
- Yeah. Oh, where do you
think I got this new top?

14:55.160 --> 14:57.640
Thank you Skydaddy13.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.170
- They're sending things to your house?

14:59.170 --> 15:00.750
Isn't that dangerous?

15:00.750 --> 15:03.660
- No, they don't send things to my house.

15:03.660 --> 15:06.930
They send me e-gift cards
and then give me the code.

15:06.930 --> 15:08.460
I'm not that stupid.

15:08.460 --> 15:11.000
- So what do you do when
they want see you in person?

15:11.000 --> 15:14.890
- Well, that's when
Jezebel Reigns disappears

15:14.890 --> 15:17.870
like a thief into the night, pun intended.

15:17.870 --> 15:19.510
- Girl, you're crazy!

15:19.510 --> 15:22.368
- Crazy good at getting free stuff!

15:22.368 --> 15:23.730
- Geez...

15:23.730 --> 15:25.220
- Are you done?

15:25.220 --> 15:27.400
- Um...Almost.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.540
- You're making us late, hurry up.

15:29.540 --> 15:32.265
(birds tweet)

15:32.265 --> 15:36.070
(car speeds by)

15:36.070 --> 15:39.400
So how long have you been
catfishing those guys?

15:39.400 --> 15:41.150
- About eight months now.

15:41.150 --> 15:42.530
- And how many?

15:42.530 --> 15:43.800
- Currently only two.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.420
At one point there were four,

15:45.420 --> 15:47.330
but the other two weren't falling for it.

15:47.330 --> 15:48.650
- Doesn't your dad think it's weird

15:48.650 --> 15:51.470
that you keep getting all
these packages in the mail?

15:51.470 --> 15:53.100
- A UFO could land in our backyard

15:53.100 --> 15:54.763
and my dad wouldn't notice.

15:55.629 --> 15:56.770
- Speaking of your dad,

15:56.770 --> 15:59.740
he told me to ask you about
getting some Halloween candy,

15:59.740 --> 16:01.580
something about him being
out of town this weekend?

16:01.580 --> 16:05.730
- And that right there is why
he never notices anything.

16:05.730 --> 16:07.520
He's always working.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.600
Ever since mom died, he's never home.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.490
And Halloween isn't
even until next Friday.

16:13.490 --> 16:17.383
- Maybe he just has a lot on his mind.

16:17.383 --> 16:20.470
(gentle music plays)

16:20.470 --> 16:23.443
You know I'm here for you, right?

16:23.443 --> 16:24.990
- Yeah. I know.

16:24.990 --> 16:28.138
That's why you're my bestie.

16:28.138 --> 16:29.430
Thanks again for picking me up.

16:29.430 --> 16:32.420
My car is not gonna be out of
the shop until next Tuesday.

16:32.420 --> 16:36.277
- Girl, I got you anytime.

16:36.277 --> 16:41.276
(upbeat music)

16:44.594 --> 16:48.688
(truck drives by)

16:48.688 --> 16:50.762
- So, how are you and Shawn?

16:50.762 --> 16:53.245
- I don't really talk to him now and

16:53.245 --> 16:55.345
I need to focus on school.

16:55.345 --> 16:57.497
- Really though? He was so cute.

16:57.497 --> 16:58.738
- Yeah...

16:58.738 --> 17:03.690
(upbeat music)

17:03.690 --> 17:08.689
(upbeat music)

17:08.689 --> 17:13.555
(upbeat music)

17:24.320 --> 17:25.520
- What are you looking at freak?

17:25.520 --> 17:26.353
- Deja!

17:26.353 --> 17:28.460
- Oh, It's fine Clara.

17:28.460 --> 17:32.465
So I hear you're applying
for Princeton, Deja.

17:32.465 --> 17:35.290
(quick typing on computer)

17:35.290 --> 17:37.300
(slams computer shut,
shoves it in backpack)

17:37.300 --> 17:39.990
I hope you can make the grade.

17:39.990 --> 17:42.530
- I don't need your hope,
I know what I can do.

17:45.530 --> 17:46.363
- Sorry.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.660
- What was that all about?
Why do you hate him so much?

17:53.660 --> 17:54.493
- He creeps me out.

17:54.493 --> 17:56.260
He gives me creepy stalker vibes.

17:56.260 --> 17:57.520
- He's not that bad.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.315
- Says you. I call it like I see it.

17:59.315 --> 18:00.200
- Mmm hmm...

18:00.200 --> 18:01.900
So see you in second period.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.730
- You ready for that test?

18:03.730 --> 18:06.350
- Honey, I was not only born fabulous,

18:06.350 --> 18:08.520
but always on the ready.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.353
- Dork!

18:09.353 --> 18:11.930
- Only dork I see is the one approaching.

18:11.930 --> 18:13.347
See you.
- See you.

18:15.563 --> 18:17.357
- Quit... stop, you know I hate that.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.000
- I just can't help it.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.334
You're so hot.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.080
- I know I am. So you
coming to my game later?

18:24.080 --> 18:27.140
- I can't, I have to work on
the trunk or treat display.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.410
- Lame. Is your dad gonna
be home this weekend?

18:29.410 --> 18:31.634
We could study the human anatomy.

18:31.634 --> 18:35.550
- Perv. It's girls only this weekend.

18:35.550 --> 18:36.383
- Call me "Chadra."

18:36.383 --> 18:38.996
I'll make you a bikini
out of whipped cream.

18:38.996 --> 18:43.210
- (laughs) Girls only. I mean it Chad.

18:43.210 --> 18:44.560
- Whatever you say babe.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.710
You're missing out on my craft skills.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.820
- I'm sure they're at expert level.

18:49.820 --> 18:51.010
Text me later?

18:51.010 --> 18:51.843
- Will do.

18:54.254 --> 18:56.420
Watch where you're going Jesus freak!

18:56.420 --> 18:57.253
- Good morning to you too, Chad.

18:58.253 --> 19:03.203
(lockers closing in background)

19:06.456 --> 19:11.456
(writing sounds)

19:20.918 --> 19:24.290
- Hey, I'm sorry about Chad earlier.

19:24.290 --> 19:26.610
He gets defensive when he's embarrassed.

19:26.610 --> 19:27.790
- It's okay, sometimes you just

19:27.790 --> 19:30.630
have to turn the other cheek
on little things like that.

19:30.630 --> 19:33.370
- I'm still sorry he pushed you.

19:33.370 --> 19:36.863
Your presentation looks really
good. It has a lot of detail.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.083
Mine's awful.

19:40.814 --> 19:42.537
Where did you learn to do that?

19:42.537 --> 19:46.703
- Oh..um...My Mom is a computer
programmer at Oak Ridge and

19:46.703 --> 19:47.536
she's been teaching me

19:47.536 --> 19:48.830
how to do these things since I was five.

19:48.830 --> 19:50.593
It kinda became how we bonded.

19:51.860 --> 19:52.693
(knock on classroom door)

19:54.830 --> 19:56.470
- Excuse me, Ms. Blaylock,

19:56.470 --> 19:58.820
Micah Green is needed in
the principal's office.

19:59.700 --> 20:04.700
(students jeering and laughing)

20:05.259 --> 20:09.114
- Class! Class that is enough.

20:09.114 --> 20:09.947
- Dammit

20:09.947 --> 20:14.897
- [Student] He's always in trouble.

20:21.518 --> 20:23.500
- Thought you were funny
with your little trick huh?

20:23.500 --> 20:24.450
Whose laughing now?

20:25.420 --> 20:26.253
Dick.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.193
- Bitch.

20:36.704 --> 20:38.312
- Well, come in.

20:38.312 --> 20:43.312
(light airy music)

20:44.780 --> 20:47.617
- Do you know why I
called you in here today?

20:47.617 --> 20:49.680
- 'Cause you missed
seeing my handsome face?

20:49.680 --> 20:52.670
- Mr. Green, this is not a time for jokes.

20:52.670 --> 20:57.330
The allegations made against
you are very serious.

20:57.330 --> 21:00.030
Do you have your laptop with you?

21:00.030 --> 21:01.180
- Yeah.

21:01.180 --> 21:04.160
- May I have it, please?

21:04.160 --> 21:05.326
(unzipping backpack)

21:15.130 --> 21:16.830
- Can I have your password please?

21:18.520 --> 21:20.170
- Can't remember all of a sudden.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.033
- Now, Mr. Green...

21:23.033 --> 21:27.949
(Mrs. Roberts begins typing on the laptop)

21:33.090 --> 21:36.720
- It's okay. I've already
accessed what I needed.

21:36.720 --> 21:40.090
The IP address matches.

21:40.090 --> 21:43.840
- Mr. Green...your
actions are very serious

21:43.840 --> 21:47.070
and it is illegal.

21:47.070 --> 21:51.651
I'm gonna have to inform the
authorities, your father,

21:51.651 --> 21:54.370
and suspend you as well.

21:54.370 --> 21:56.930
- May I make a suggestion?

21:56.930 --> 21:58.740
In lieu of calling the authorities.

21:58.740 --> 22:00.090
Why not have Mr. Green help out

22:00.090 --> 22:02.430
with the preparations
for the trunk or treat?

22:02.430 --> 22:04.560
I find community work
to be very educational

22:04.560 --> 22:06.290
for our youth.

22:06.290 --> 22:10.892
Idle hands are the devil's
playground after all.

22:10.892 --> 22:14.075
- I'm still going to
have to call your father

22:14.075 --> 22:18.890
and suspend you for a week.

22:18.890 --> 22:23.405
Wait outside my office for your father.

22:24.530 --> 22:29.090
And Mr. Green, there
cannot be a repeat of this.

22:31.971 --> 22:33.880
(door slams)

22:33.880 --> 22:35.930
Thank you so much for your help, Betty.

22:35.930 --> 22:36.780
- Oh, that's fine.

22:36.780 --> 22:38.090
I'm always happy to help.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.450
I had to pick up some art supplies

22:39.450 --> 22:41.710
for the trunk or treat anyway.

22:41.710 --> 22:45.228
I better be off, lot's to do
before I have to pick up Jacob.

22:45.228 --> 22:50.228
(gentle music)

22:50.877 --> 22:55.069
(dials phone number)

23:00.807 --> 23:05.780
- Mr. Green, there's been an
incident here at the school.

23:05.780 --> 23:07.630
We need you to come pick up your son.

23:09.052 --> 23:11.494
(bell rings)

23:11.494 --> 23:16.480
(background hallway chatter)

23:29.010 --> 23:30.050
- I got some tea to spill.

23:30.050 --> 23:33.550
So stalker boy hacked into
the school's main computer.

23:33.550 --> 23:35.080
- Seriously, how do you know that?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.210
- Our progress reports were
passed out today in class

23:37.210 --> 23:38.380
and I had all F's,

23:38.380 --> 23:40.290
I've never gotten an F in my life.

23:40.290 --> 23:41.910
Stupid bustard gave himself away

23:41.910 --> 23:43.770
with a snide ass remark this morning.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.700
- Holy crap. Are you serious?

23:45.700 --> 23:47.640
- Yes, those are my grades Clara.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.150
He screwed with my grades.

23:49.150 --> 23:50.980
I'm trying to get into Princeton, okay.

23:50.980 --> 23:53.080
This is not okay that he would do that.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.723
- [Mr. Green] What the
hell were you thinking?!?

23:55.723 --> 23:59.630
You listen to me boy. I am
damn tired of your shit.

23:59.630 --> 24:03.928
I had to leave work to come down here.

24:03.928 --> 24:06.013
- Sorry!

24:06.013 --> 24:09.690
- You're sorry? I'm losing money
because of your horse shit.

24:09.690 --> 24:13.941
And you think sorry is
gonna make up for that?

24:15.050 --> 24:16.960
You're gonna be sorry.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.266
Get your ass in that truck.

24:18.266 --> 24:23.124
(tense music)

24:25.020 --> 24:26.350
- I feel so bad for him.

24:26.350 --> 24:28.560
- I don't. He did it to himself.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.470
We still on for this weekend?

24:30.470 --> 24:32.470
- Yeah, Kimmy's coming over after work.

24:32.470 --> 24:35.080
- Okay, cool. You ready for this test?

24:35.080 --> 24:36.260
- [Clara] You know with
all that commotion,

24:36.260 --> 24:37.968
I almost forgot about it.

24:37.968 --> 24:39.593
Let's just get it over with.

24:42.569 --> 24:47.050
(truck rumbles down road)

24:47.050 --> 24:50.900
- Boy...you are lucky I
did not get fired today.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.790
- I already said I'm sorry.

24:52.790 --> 24:57.522
- Bullshit! I am sick of your shit Micah!

24:57.522 --> 24:59.910
- [Micah] Like mom was tired of yours?

24:59.910 --> 25:02.230
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

25:02.230 --> 25:04.030
- Now what the hell did
you just say to me?!?

25:04.030 --> 25:06.220
- Like mom was tired of yours!

25:06.220 --> 25:09.905
- Look around you, Micah.
Your Saint ain't here.

25:11.330 --> 25:12.460
She didn't want you either.

25:12.460 --> 25:13.950
- Because of you!

25:13.950 --> 25:17.590
You're always drunk. You
gamble all of our money away.

25:17.590 --> 25:20.026
Mom left because of you!

25:21.880 --> 25:22.713
Mom knew she-
(punch thuds)

25:22.713 --> 25:24.649
- You watch how you speak to me boy.

25:24.649 --> 25:27.880
(tense music)

25:27.880 --> 25:30.399
Micah...you get your ass here boy!

25:30.399 --> 25:33.492
(tense music)

25:33.492 --> 25:35.725
- Shit!

25:38.827 --> 25:41.915
(truck engine revving)

25:41.915 --> 25:46.915
(truck speeds away)

25:52.645 --> 25:57.628
(car pulls in and parks)

26:12.293 --> 26:15.126
(door chime dings)

26:16.257 --> 26:19.340
(cheerful music plays in background)

26:19.340 --> 26:21.530
- Hey Kimmy, I called that
prescription in earlier.

26:21.530 --> 26:24.770
- Oh yeah, yeah...I have that
right...right here for you.

26:24.770 --> 26:25.603
Don't worry about it.

26:25.603 --> 26:26.436
- Thanks

26:26.436 --> 26:27.269
- Hey Mrs. Roberts.

26:27.269 --> 26:30.260
- Hi Clara, it's nice to see you.

26:30.260 --> 26:31.990
- I just have a few things to
grab, so I'll be right back.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.670
- Yeah, I'll just work on that right now.

26:33.670 --> 26:34.530
What up, loser?

26:34.530 --> 26:35.776
- Hey Kimmy.

26:35.776 --> 26:38.342
- Hey

26:38.342 --> 26:40.642
- Are you still coming over tonight?

26:40.642 --> 26:45.020
- Ugh! Do I have to?
- Yes.

26:45.020 --> 26:48.110
- You and Deja with me wanting
to come over all the time.

26:48.110 --> 26:51.030
I mean, I guess I'll come over,

26:51.030 --> 26:52.650
but you know I have to finish up here,

26:52.650 --> 26:54.740
just be a couple minutes, is that fine?

26:54.740 --> 26:56.790
- Could you bring some art supplies?

26:56.790 --> 26:59.300
(paper bag ruffles)

26:59.300 --> 27:01.370
- Do I look like I have art supplies?

27:01.370 --> 27:02.203
- Not really.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.480
- What are you doing with this?

27:03.480 --> 27:05.500
What is this? Are you
trying to check out here?

27:05.500 --> 27:06.333
- [Clara] Yes

27:06.333 --> 27:07.891
- This is not a checkout counter, Clara.

27:07.891 --> 27:08.810
- [Clara] Okay well...

27:08.810 --> 27:10.300
- This is a pharmacy counter, Clara!

27:10.300 --> 27:12.000
- [Clara] The customer's
always right, Kimmy.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.296
- You can't check out if there's
no checkout machine, Clara!

27:16.296 --> 27:19.734
[Kimmy] ...just gonna buy
candy at my pharmacy counter..

27:19.734 --> 27:22.137
I hate this store. I just really
want to die all the time...

27:22.137 --> 27:23.507
- Hi, Mrs. Robert, how are you doing?

27:23.507 --> 27:24.710
Did you find everything okay?

27:24.710 --> 27:25.543
- I did thank you.

27:25.543 --> 27:28.800
- All right, let me take
care of that for you.

27:28.800 --> 27:31.260
Okay, are you gonna be gardening today?

27:31.260 --> 27:32.167
- Hoping to get started.

27:32.167 --> 27:35.030
- All right, that sounds great.
Sounds like a lot of fun.

27:35.030 --> 27:38.160
Here's your prescription,
that's gonna be 89.95.

27:38.160 --> 27:38.993
- All right, there you go.
- There you go.

27:38.993 --> 27:39.940
Will you need a bag for this?

27:39.940 --> 27:42.170
- Oh, I should be fine.
- Okay.

27:42.170 --> 27:43.017
- Thank you.

27:43.017 --> 27:44.170
(credit card machine beeps)

27:44.170 --> 27:45.810
- Clara, will we be
seeing you and your father

27:45.810 --> 27:46.730
at church this Sunday?

27:46.730 --> 27:48.542
- Of course. We'll definitely be there.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.570
- Good, it'll be really
nice to have you both back.

27:50.570 --> 27:52.330
We missed you.

27:52.330 --> 27:54.010
And thank you both for offering to help

27:54.010 --> 27:55.030
with the trunk or treat

27:55.030 --> 27:57.850
the children of Eden will
be so thankful, I know I am.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.921
- Of course, we're more
than happy to help.

27:59.921 --> 28:00.754
- Uh huh...yeah...

28:00.754 --> 28:02.090
- Great. All right,
well, I gotta get going.

28:02.090 --> 28:04.180
Oh, before I forget, can I get your email?

28:04.180 --> 28:06.140
I'm gonna send you some
ideas for the display.

28:06.140 --> 28:07.600
- Okay, yeah sure. Do you have paper?

28:07.600 --> 28:08.660
- Mmm hmm..

28:08.660 --> 28:09.493
- Yep.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.570
- Really appreciate your help.

28:12.570 --> 28:15.370
- [Kimmy] Oh yeah...I
totally wanted to do that.

28:15.370 --> 28:16.680
- Great.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.513
- Okay...

28:17.513 --> 28:18.550
- All righty.
- Thank you.

28:18.550 --> 28:20.100
I'll get that out to you tonight.

28:20.100 --> 28:20.933
- Okay. Cool.

28:20.933 --> 28:21.820
- All right. Have a good day girls.

28:21.820 --> 28:23.643
- [Kimmy] You too!

28:23.643 --> 28:25.760
- I don't remember volunteering for that.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.370
- You didn't, I volunteered you.

28:27.370 --> 28:30.200
- Okay, so how are you paying for this?

28:30.200 --> 28:31.541
- Cash.

28:31.541 --> 28:34.000
- Oh, do you have cash?
- I do have cash.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.900
- [Kimmy] I'm very impressed with you.

28:35.900 --> 28:37.290
- I bet you are.

28:37.290 --> 28:40.070
- I will be taking that and
I will be keeping the change

28:40.070 --> 28:42.606
'cause someone needs art supplies, right?

28:43.570 --> 28:44.403
- See you later.

28:45.851 --> 28:47.110
- [Customer] I'm here to
pick up my prescription.

28:47.110 --> 28:48.610
- Absolutely, can I get your last name?

28:53.715 --> 28:55.650
- Hey hooker, you forget about me?

28:55.650 --> 28:57.040
- Definitely.

28:57.040 --> 28:57.873
- Dick.

29:00.735 --> 29:03.902
(car engine cranking)

29:06.500 --> 29:09.273
- Stupid prick. You're so stupid.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.203
God I am so tired of you.

29:13.552 --> 29:18.233
"Oh...your saint ain't here"
- because of you, you drunk!

29:19.069 --> 29:24.053
(low ominous music)

29:28.174 --> 29:30.745
Hmm...Silver lining after all.

29:30.745 --> 29:33.897
(camera taking photos)

29:33.897 --> 29:38.897
(low ominous music)

29:45.510 --> 29:50.443
(low drums play)

30:07.500 --> 30:09.600
- So Kimmy, did you know?

30:09.600 --> 30:10.540
- Did I know what?

30:10.540 --> 30:13.760
- About Clara's half naked
women she shares online.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.630
- My God, I didn't know you swung my way.

30:16.630 --> 30:17.980
- I don't.

30:17.980 --> 30:21.370
- Well, you should. Come to
the dark side we bake cookies.

30:21.370 --> 30:23.940
- As much as I love cookies and you Kimmy,

30:23.940 --> 30:27.310
we both know I'm strictly dickly.

30:27.310 --> 30:28.150
- So what are you doing?

30:28.150 --> 30:30.660
- She cons stupid dudes for money.

30:30.660 --> 30:34.500
- Now, I like to think of it
as I fill one of their needs

30:34.500 --> 30:38.110
and they fulfill my material needs.

30:38.110 --> 30:40.312
Not my fault they're stupid.

30:40.312 --> 30:43.190
(Kimmy lets out a long sigh)

30:43.190 --> 30:46.210
- You should really read this book.

30:46.210 --> 30:47.590
How are they falling for this?

30:47.590 --> 30:48.660
I mean, it's pretty simple.

30:48.660 --> 30:50.820
I send them pictures and
they send me gift cards.

30:50.820 --> 30:52.285
Everyone's happy.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.620
- So does Chad know about this?

30:56.620 --> 30:58.620
- No. And he isn't going to.

30:58.620 --> 30:59.820
I mean, they're not my pictures,

30:59.820 --> 31:01.670
so it technically isn't even cheating.

31:01.670 --> 31:04.420
- Girl, you're pulling out
every excuse from the book.

31:04.420 --> 31:06.470
- Only the good ones.

31:06.470 --> 31:09.489
- Now are we gonna get started on this?

31:09.489 --> 31:11.190
- Uh...I guess...

31:11.190 --> 31:12.282
- What's the theme?

31:12.282 --> 31:15.665
- Um...Actually, let me check.

31:20.220 --> 31:23.281
Looks like angels.

31:23.281 --> 31:24.408
- Angels.

31:24.408 --> 31:28.870
(all laughs)
- Oh God, we're all screwed..

31:29.732 --> 31:31.357
(Girls all laugh loudly)

31:37.171 --> 31:38.730
- Hey hun? Dinner's ready.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.890
- Okay, I'll be done in a second.

31:39.890 --> 31:41.380
- What are you watching?

31:41.380 --> 31:43.510
- Oh, uh "Mean Girlz".

31:43.510 --> 31:45.190
- That doesn't sound like
a very wholesome film.

31:45.190 --> 31:48.130
- It's not, but it reminds
me of the kids at my school.

31:48.130 --> 31:49.680
- Is someone being mean to you?

31:49.680 --> 31:52.420
- No, everything's fine, I promise.

31:52.420 --> 31:55.141
- Okay. Now go eat.
- Okay.

32:03.406 --> 32:08.397
(upbeat music plays)

32:18.610 --> 32:20.700
- Heavenly Father, we
thank you for this food,

32:20.700 --> 32:22.890
we pray that it will go to
the nourishment of our bodies

32:22.890 --> 32:26.280
the way your word nourishes our souls.

32:26.280 --> 32:28.820
We thank you for the
blessings that you granted us

32:28.820 --> 32:30.670
and pray that you continue to guide us,

32:30.670 --> 32:32.939
In Jesus name we pray, amen.

32:32.939 --> 32:34.152
- Amen.
- Amen.

32:35.190 --> 32:37.430
- Did you do something
different with the potatoes?

32:37.430 --> 32:39.630
- Yes, actually. I'm
trying out a new recipe.

32:40.925 --> 32:41.900
(Mr. Roberts breathes in deeply)

32:41.900 --> 32:44.850
- Well, if it tastes as
good as it looks and smells,

32:44.850 --> 32:45.700
we have a winner.

32:46.685 --> 32:48.043
- That's sweet. Thank you.

32:50.550 --> 32:52.170
Jacob have you decided whether or not

32:52.170 --> 32:53.550
you'll be joining the
boys youth group trip

32:53.550 --> 32:55.210
for winter break?

32:55.210 --> 32:57.126
I hear they have a great time.

32:58.430 --> 33:01.210
- I don't know, I'm
not really into skiing,

33:01.210 --> 33:04.560
but some of the boys
talked about the Aquarium.

33:04.560 --> 33:05.920
- Oh the Aquarium?

33:05.920 --> 33:06.753
That's where your mother and I

33:06.753 --> 33:09.040
went on our anniversary last time.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.510
I think you'll like that.

33:10.510 --> 33:14.100
- Penguins are my favorite.
They're just adorable.

33:14.100 --> 33:16.990
- You say that about all
of God's animals though.

33:16.990 --> 33:17.823
- Yes she does.

33:18.700 --> 33:22.299
- Yes. That's because I
love all God's creations.

33:22.299 --> 33:24.450
- Betty, that is not what
you said about that snake

33:24.450 --> 33:27.492
we found on the shade last fall. (laughs)

33:27.492 --> 33:28.500
(Mrs. Roberts shudders)

33:28.500 --> 33:31.410
- Okay, maybe most of God's creations,

33:31.410 --> 33:33.193
just not the slithering kind.

33:34.030 --> 33:37.010
Besides it reminds me of
the serpent in Genesis.

33:37.010 --> 33:38.023
Just evil.

33:39.130 --> 33:43.701
- Now, hon. Even the serpent
has a purpose in God's plan.

33:45.060 --> 33:46.201
- That's true.

33:48.116 --> 33:48.949
What about you honey?

33:48.949 --> 33:50.718
Have you finished your
sermon for Sunday yet?

33:50.718 --> 33:52.663
- Um...not quite...

34:03.087 --> 34:08.003
(water faucet running)

34:17.326 --> 34:20.493
(intense, ominous music)

34:32.416 --> 34:37.408
(pill bottle rattles)

34:54.549 --> 34:59.253
(typing sounds on keyboard)

34:59.253 --> 35:04.253
(gentle music plays)

35:04.647 --> 35:05.480
- Hey hon.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.961
- Hey, beautiful. What's up?

35:07.961 --> 35:10.200
- How long you gonna be?

35:10.200 --> 35:13.340
- Not long, just got a
little bit more to go.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.460
- What's your topic this Sunday?

35:16.460 --> 35:17.830
- Temptation.

35:17.830 --> 35:19.960
I figured with the holidays
just around the corner,

35:19.960 --> 35:22.083
temptation is gonna be in abundance.

35:24.770 --> 35:27.992
- Mr.Roberts?
- Yes.

35:27.992 --> 35:30.308
- Might I tempt you into coming to bed?

35:31.200 --> 35:34.100
- Mrs. Roberts, are you coming on to me?

35:34.100 --> 35:36.683
- What, I'm just fulfilling
my wifely duties.

35:37.690 --> 35:40.145
Maybe I can show you what that entails.

35:41.544 --> 35:42.377
- Amen.

35:44.092 --> 35:49.059
(gentle music)

35:50.406 --> 35:55.405
(birds chirping)

36:19.694 --> 36:24.694
(Jacob types on keyboard)

36:30.645 --> 36:31.536
- [Mr. Roberts] Hey Jacob,

36:31.536 --> 36:34.141
could you come help me out for a minute?

36:34.141 --> 36:38.949
(gentle music)

36:50.610 --> 36:54.122
- Oh Frank, always forgetting
to shut down your computer.

36:54.122 --> 36:59.064
(gentle music)

37:22.773 --> 37:27.123
(ominous music)

37:44.408 --> 37:45.241
(mousepad click)

37:58.271 --> 37:59.104
(mousepad click)

38:00.690 --> 38:03.111
(laptop slams shut)

38:03.111 --> 38:03.944
(Mrs. Roberts sighs)

38:08.241 --> 38:13.216
(Mrs. Roberts is chopping oranges loudly)

38:26.650 --> 38:28.480
- Well, that smells great, hon.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.507
- You left computer on again.

38:30.507 --> 38:34.338
- Hmm..I did? My mind was a
little distracted last night.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.120
Did you get a chance to look
over my sermon for tomorrow?

38:40.120 --> 38:44.298
- Yes, I did. It was insightful.

38:45.340 --> 38:46.850
- Still have a few tweaks to make on it,

38:46.850 --> 38:49.423
but I think it'd be a great sermon.

38:50.790 --> 38:52.987
- Maybe you should take
your own sermon's advice.

38:53.961 --> 38:56.083
- I'm sorry hon, what was that?

38:56.083 --> 38:59.910
- Just that I hope the weather's nice.

38:59.910 --> 39:02.880
I really wanted to prune the
roses before our first frost.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.587
- The weatherman says it's
gonna be sunny and 72º today.

39:07.630 --> 39:08.630
- That's good to know.

39:10.138 --> 39:11.988
I'm going to go wash up before I eat.

39:23.640 --> 39:26.473
(water running)

39:30.983 --> 39:35.983
(Mrs. Roberts weeps)

39:40.260 --> 39:43.420
- Hey mom, can I borrow
the laptop for a project?

39:43.420 --> 39:44.970
- Yeah it's fine. I don't care.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.525
- Are you okay?

39:48.880 --> 39:50.030
- Yeah honey, I'm fine.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.283
Got some soap in my eyes. Silly, I know.

39:56.130 --> 39:58.203
Your breakfast is ready
for you in the kitchen.

39:59.060 --> 40:00.270
- I'm gonna eat in my room.

40:00.270 --> 40:01.770
I wanna get this project done.

40:03.751 --> 40:07.050
- That's fine. Can you help
me in the garden later?

40:07.050 --> 40:07.891
- Sure thing.

40:07.891 --> 40:12.891
(gentle music)

40:15.881 --> 40:20.823
(medicine bottle rattling)

40:32.800 --> 40:34.210
- [Deja] We've looked at so many of these

40:34.210 --> 40:35.653
I'm becoming cross-eyed.

40:36.570 --> 40:37.750
- I thought that was just your face.

40:37.750 --> 40:41.520
- Shut up. Seriously
Clara can we just wing it?

40:41.520 --> 40:44.763
- Well, aren't you just punny?
- I thought so.

40:44.763 --> 40:47.310
(email chimes)
- What's that?

40:47.310 --> 40:49.023
- It's just a new message.

40:49.023 --> 40:52.100
- Uh huh, I wanna see.
- Yeah, me too.

40:52.100 --> 40:52.933
- Fine.

40:52.933 --> 40:55.360
- Anything has to be better
than this current craft hell.

40:55.360 --> 40:58.693
- Oh, he's thinking of you.
- Uh, shut up.

40:58.693 --> 41:00.140
- Give me.

41:00.140 --> 41:03.630
- Oh my gosh, what are you typing?

41:03.630 --> 41:04.835
- You'll see.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.390
Done and sent.

41:09.390 --> 41:11.628
- Good Lord, let's see what you wrote.

41:14.490 --> 41:15.550
- You scandalous hussy.

41:15.550 --> 41:17.700
You wrote it like an erotica novel.

41:17.700 --> 41:18.533
- I'm scandalous?

41:18.533 --> 41:20.424
She's the one who's been
stringing him along.

41:20.424 --> 41:21.593
- Ugh...

41:21.593 --> 41:26.593
I'm thinking of you. I wanna
put your hands on my body

41:26.600 --> 41:31.596
and your lips on mine and put your member?

41:31.596 --> 41:33.854
- Member?!?

41:33.854 --> 41:35.880
- Really, really that's
what you're focusing on.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.680
- I mean, it's just weird.

41:37.680 --> 41:38.620
- Just like you.

41:38.620 --> 41:41.750
- Come on ladies, we need
to focus on why we came here

41:41.750 --> 41:44.480
and that is to make a heavenly display.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.480
- Fine, but I still
have glitter stuck to me

41:46.480 --> 41:47.720
from last night.

41:47.720 --> 41:51.360
- Glerpies. Glerpies.
You have glitter herpes.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.968
- Come on! We're never
gonna get this done!

41:53.968 --> 41:56.000
- (laughs) It's a joke. It was funny.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.760
(email chimes)

41:57.760 --> 42:02.003
Oh, it looks like he wants
to use that member in person.

42:03.990 --> 42:06.708
He said he can make your
dreams into a reality.

42:06.708 --> 42:09.528
- Oh Girl, he wants to be
the new member in your club.

42:09.528 --> 42:11.820
- Mmm. Uh uh. Shut up.

42:11.820 --> 42:13.810
- You're blushing!
- No, I'm not.

42:13.810 --> 42:14.963
- Yeah you are.

42:17.680 --> 42:18.963
- You're a virgin.

42:20.911 --> 42:23.943
- No, she's slept with Chad before.

42:23.943 --> 42:28.943
- I mean, we've done
things. Just not that.

42:30.409 --> 42:32.333
- Hmm...that's not what I heard.

42:32.333 --> 42:34.550
- What did you hear?

42:34.550 --> 42:37.290
- Don't make me tell her!
- Just tell me!

42:37.290 --> 42:40.600
- Fine. Just don't shoot the messenger.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.820
Chad said that he slept with you

42:43.820 --> 42:45.730
under the football bleachers.

42:45.730 --> 42:49.140
- What?
- Are you okay?

42:49.140 --> 42:52.740
- No! How could he do that?!?

42:52.740 --> 42:55.050
- What are you going to do?

42:55.050 --> 42:56.376
Clara?

42:56.376 --> 42:59.209
(typing on cell phone)

43:02.300 --> 43:05.675
(typing on cell phone)

43:07.703 --> 43:08.686
(Clara slams phone onto bed)

43:08.686 --> 43:11.200
- I just dumped him.
- Really?

43:11.200 --> 43:14.002
- Yeah. I can't believe
he would do that to me.

43:14.002 --> 43:15.952
- He wasn't good enough for you anyway.

43:16.790 --> 43:18.750
- I feel so dumb.

43:18.750 --> 43:21.180
- I mean, don't feel
dumb, it's not your fault.

43:21.180 --> 43:25.753
And he's the dumb one
for losing you, I guess.

43:25.753 --> 43:28.253
(email chimes)

43:30.320 --> 43:32.260
Do you want me to respond to this?

43:32.260 --> 43:33.430
- Yeah.

43:33.430 --> 43:34.850
Tell him my car's in the shop

43:34.850 --> 43:38.913
and that I'll talk to him later.

43:42.840 --> 43:43.673
- Okay.

43:46.431 --> 43:49.417
- By the way, uh, Dej can you take me?

43:50.600 --> 43:53.610
- Wish I could, but mom will have the car,

43:53.610 --> 43:56.870
dad's is in the shop, but I
could Uber with you though.

43:56.870 --> 43:57.703
- Thanks.

43:59.237 --> 44:01.737
(text message chimes)

44:10.893 --> 44:15.687
(ominous music plays)

44:15.687 --> 44:16.520
(creaky door opens)

44:16.520 --> 44:17.353
- Micah!

44:19.824 --> 44:20.657
Micah!

44:24.407 --> 44:27.270
Get up! I said get up!

44:27.270 --> 44:28.103
- What?!?

44:30.351 --> 44:31.702
It's Saturday.

44:31.702 --> 44:33.085
- "Oh it's Saturday."

44:33.085 --> 44:34.768
Because of that stunt
you pulled yesterday,

44:34.768 --> 44:36.413
I get to pull an extra shift at work.

44:36.413 --> 44:38.590
If I got to work, you do too.

44:38.590 --> 44:39.986
Now get up!

44:39.986 --> 44:41.110
(Micah groans)

44:41.110 --> 44:43.400
I want you out in that
truck in five minutes boy.

44:43.400 --> 44:45.376
Do not make me wait.

44:45.376 --> 44:50.351
(light airy music)

44:56.742 --> 45:00.642
(water faucet turns on in adjacent room)

45:02.160 --> 45:05.493
(electric razor turns on in adjacent room)

45:07.697 --> 45:12.697
(cars passing on highway)

45:22.824 --> 45:26.965
(truck pulls in)

45:51.988 --> 45:54.778
- Dad's waiting on you
in the back Mr. Green.

45:54.778 --> 45:55.778
- Wait here.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.660
- What is it, bring your son to work day?

45:59.660 --> 46:00.713
- Look who's talking.

46:01.930 --> 46:03.590
- Difference is my dad owns this place.

46:03.590 --> 46:04.974
- Whatever dude.

46:04.974 --> 46:07.270
(air wrenches humming)

46:07.270 --> 46:08.403
- Come on back Micah.

46:16.576 --> 46:21.576
(air wrenches humming)

46:21.900 --> 46:26.430
Ohhhhh...I need to start this brake job.

46:26.430 --> 46:31.430
I want you to sweep these
floors, wash the windows,

46:31.445 --> 46:35.390
take out the trash and
clean the bathrooms.

46:35.390 --> 46:37.290
All right, all the cleaning supplies

46:37.290 --> 46:38.723

46:41.530 --> 46:43.853
Don't just stand there.
Get to work, come on.

48:35.230 --> 48:37.100
- What are you doing?

48:37.100 --> 48:40.070
- Just changing the mats in Clara's car.

48:40.070 --> 48:41.790
- Well aren't you a good boyfriend.

48:41.790 --> 48:43.770
- I'm not dating that skank.

48:43.770 --> 48:45.843
- I just saw you two yesterday.

48:46.960 --> 48:49.860
- I dumped her and she's gonna pay for it.

48:49.860 --> 48:52.603
- That doesn't make
any sense you dumped...

48:54.100 --> 48:55.950
You know what? I don't even care.

48:55.950 --> 48:56.980
Where's my dad?

48:56.980 --> 48:58.147
- He's out front.

48:59.230 --> 49:04.147
(light airy music)

49:17.129 --> 49:18.354

49:23.374 --> 49:26.407
(Kimmy snores)

49:54.890 --> 49:56.800
- Wow. We did really well guys.

49:56.800 --> 49:59.550
- We?
- Yeah, it looks great.

49:59.550 --> 50:01.008
- Yeah. And you know what?

50:01.008 --> 50:02.510
I think it looks really good.

50:02.510 --> 50:04.720
- I'll be happy to
never see glitter again.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.941
- Same.
- Yeah.

50:08.200 --> 50:09.163
- What time is it?

50:10.800 --> 50:13.420
- It's already 6:30.
- I got to go.

50:13.420 --> 50:15.780
My mom needs a car back by seven.

50:15.780 --> 50:19.150
- Yeah, you know, as much
as I would love to stay

50:19.150 --> 50:22.990
and like stick more dolls
on boards with you guys,

50:22.990 --> 50:24.490
but like I got to go.

50:24.490 --> 50:26.020
- You're gonna be all right Clara?

50:26.020 --> 50:27.346
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

50:27.346 --> 50:29.670
Uh, Dad's gonna be back soon.

50:29.670 --> 50:32.730
You know what? Let me walk you out.

50:32.730 --> 50:33.563
- [Kimmy] Thanks bro.

50:33.563 --> 50:35.000
- [Clara] Uh huh...

50:35.000 --> 50:37.565
- [Kimmy] Angels. Wow.

50:37.565 --> 50:39.265
- [Clara] You're not an angel.

50:39.265 --> 50:44.233
(car pulls in garage)

50:45.456 --> 50:48.206
(birds chirping)

50:50.541 --> 50:52.500
- [Mr. Banks] Did you
get your display done?

50:52.500 --> 50:54.129
- Yeah, we did.

50:54.129 --> 50:54.962
- Good.

50:58.350 --> 50:59.962
What's wrong? You not like it?

50:59.962 --> 51:03.260
I thought...I thought
that was your favorite.

51:03.260 --> 51:06.023
- It is, I'm just really not hungry.

51:07.940 --> 51:09.330
- Is everything okay?

51:09.330 --> 51:10.393
- Yes.

51:11.620 --> 51:12.863
No.

51:14.010 --> 51:14.943
I don't know.

51:16.652 --> 51:18.180
- What's going on?

51:18.180 --> 51:19.563
- Chad and I broke up.

51:20.600 --> 51:22.520
- Really? How come?

51:23.450 --> 51:24.923
- Because he's stupid.

51:26.880 --> 51:30.866
- Something happen that
I need to know about?

51:31.870 --> 51:34.220
- No. I don't wanna talk about it.

51:34.220 --> 51:35.935
Can I please be excused?

51:36.986 --> 51:41.140
- Yeah. At least eat your fortune cookie,

51:41.140 --> 51:43.400
always time for a fortune cookie.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.984
Who knows, that may be some good news.

51:45.984 --> 51:50.926
(light airy music)

51:54.630 --> 51:57.605
- Every action has consequence.

51:59.078 --> 52:01.478
Shittiest. Fortune. Ever.

52:01.478 --> 52:06.320

(brush strokes)

53:08.038 --> 53:12.996
(dogs barking outside)

53:12.996 --> 53:15.340
- Hey champ could you make
sure the laptop's charged

53:15.340 --> 53:16.330
before you go to bed?

53:16.330 --> 53:18.190
- Sure thing dad.

53:18.190 --> 53:19.113
- Thanks.

53:20.320 --> 53:25.099
I'm gonna turn in for the
night hon, you coming?

53:25.099 --> 53:27.666
- I need to finish this,
I'll come to bed later.

53:29.501 --> 53:30.477
- Are you okay?

53:30.477 --> 53:31.663
- I'm fine.

53:33.230 --> 53:35.376
- Just don't forget to
take your medication.

53:35.376 --> 53:37.273
You know you don't feel right without it.

53:38.449 --> 53:40.124
(medicine bottle slammed on floor)

53:46.849 --> 53:48.007
(medicine bottle slammed on floor)

53:51.502 --> 53:53.530
- Good night son.
- Night dad.

53:53.530 --> 53:56.447
(ominous music)

53:57.590 --> 54:00.198
(dogs barking outside loudly)

54:01.364 --> 54:02.764
- Barking...

54:02.764 --> 54:03.597
Stop barking...

54:03.597 --> 54:07.630
just stop barking...just..why
does it keep barking?

54:07.630 --> 54:08.463
Stop barking!

54:09.984 --> 54:13.142
Why? Why even have a dog if you're

54:13.142 --> 54:15.131
not gonna keep it inside...inside?

54:15.131 --> 54:19.339
(dog growls disturbingly)

54:19.339 --> 54:20.344
- Are you okay?

54:20.344 --> 54:21.335
- I just want it to stop...

54:22.609 --> 54:24.442
- They just don't care.

54:25.397 --> 54:26.688
- The thought of anybody...

54:26.688 --> 54:28.269
(dog growls disturbingly)

54:28.269 --> 54:29.830
- Barking all night...

54:29.830 --> 54:31.651
(dog growls disturbingly)

54:31.651 --> 54:34.315
- Barking all night

54:34.315 --> 54:35.882
(dog growls disturbingly)

54:37.186 --> 54:39.478
- Why won't it stop?

54:39.478 --> 54:40.791
...won't stop barking!

54:40.791 --> 54:43.811
- Shh...I'll go talk to the neighbors.

54:43.811 --> 54:48.620
(light airy music)

55:03.744 --> 55:07.290
(dog barks)

55:07.290 --> 55:12.265
(dog continues barking outside)

55:17.751 --> 55:19.767
(dog yelps in pain)

55:37.033 --> 55:38.950
(door opens and closes)

55:38.950 --> 55:43.617
- [Jacob] You shouldn't hear
the dog barking anymore mom.

55:46.226 --> 55:47.559
What did you do?!?

55:51.936 --> 55:54.411
(Mrs. Roberts weeps)

55:59.171 --> 56:01.418
- It doesn't look that deep.

56:01.418 --> 56:06.385
(light airy music)

56:14.677 --> 56:16.934
come on, let's get you to bed.

56:16.934 --> 56:19.851

56:49.670 --> 56:54.420

57:02.174 --> 57:03.674

57:47.140 --> 57:47.973
[Churchgoer] Good morning.

57:53.415 --> 57:54.460
- Who are you saving the seat for?

57:54.460 --> 57:55.450
- Saving it for Clara.

57:55.450 --> 57:56.283
- No!

57:57.739 --> 57:58.866
- Why not?

57:58.866 --> 57:59.699
- I, um...

58:02.060 --> 58:05.370
- Her father's coming today.
She should sit with him.

58:05.370 --> 58:06.980
- Oh, okay.

58:08.120 --> 58:11.037
(light airy music)

58:51.470 --> 58:53.520
- Now for 40 days and 40 nights

58:54.800 --> 58:58.293
Jesus prayed in the
desert, no food, no water.

59:00.640 --> 59:03.263
Three times, Satan came to tempt him.

59:04.540 --> 59:07.100
Now we read Matthew chapter 4, verse 4,

59:08.320 --> 59:11.860
Jesus reply after Satan had told him

59:11.860 --> 59:13.685
to turn some stones into bread.

59:14.740 --> 59:19.740
And though He was hungry,
Jesus replied to Satan,

59:20.097 --> 59:23.920
"Man shall not live by bread alone,

59:23.920 --> 59:28.060
but by every word that proceeds
out of the mouth of God."

59:28.060 --> 59:30.290
Jesus showed us that even though food

59:30.290 --> 59:32.470
could sustaining the body for a time,

59:32.470 --> 59:34.433
it can not sustain the spirit.

59:36.540 --> 59:38.200
To separate yourself from God

59:38.200 --> 59:40.400
is to create spiritual starvation.

59:40.400 --> 59:44.483
Now temptation can come in many forms.

59:47.040 --> 59:50.840
Like with knowledge...the
serpent tempted Eve in the garden

59:53.150 --> 59:54.443
Or from those you trust,

59:56.200 --> 59:59.613
like Samson did Delilah with
the secret to his strength.

1:00:00.830 --> 1:00:03.590
It is why we must turn
to the word of God...

1:00:05.390 --> 1:00:06.853
for guidance when we're lost,

1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:09.793
strength when we're weak,

1:00:11.730 --> 1:00:14.623
for discernment when we're
offered things from others.

1:00:16.730 --> 1:00:19.483
To be aware of wolves in sheep's clothing.

1:00:21.830 --> 1:00:24.783
And it is only then
through Him and only Him

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:28.233
that we can overcome temptation.

1:00:30.890 --> 1:00:33.780
Now, let us pray.

1:00:33.780 --> 1:00:34.880
Please bow your heads.

1:00:36.210 --> 1:00:38.733
Heavenly Father we come before you now...

1:00:44.135 --> 1:00:47.310
- We're so glad you and
your dad could make it.

1:00:47.310 --> 1:00:48.143
I know.
- What?

1:00:48.143 --> 1:00:49.410
(ominous music)

1:00:49.410 --> 1:00:52.520
Mrs. Roberts, you're hurting me.

1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:55.639
- I'm sorry, I guess I just
don't know my grasp sometimes.

1:00:55.639 --> 1:00:58.680
I just meant that I know
I'll be seeing more of you...

1:00:58.680 --> 1:00:59.810
- Yeah.

1:00:59.810 --> 1:01:02.150
- Helping out with the trunk
or treat this Thursday!

1:01:02.150 --> 1:01:04.625
- Of course, definitely.

1:01:04.625 --> 1:01:07.672
Um...I'm gonna go catch
up with my dad now.

1:01:07.672 --> 1:01:08.940
- You should probably go catch up.

1:01:08.940 --> 1:01:10.210
- Yeah.

1:01:10.210 --> 1:01:11.566
- Good to see you.

1:01:13.065 --> 1:01:14.190
- [Churchgoer] Great service...

1:01:15.628 --> 1:01:17.403
(Birds chirping)

1:01:41.208 --> 1:01:43.708
(phone rings)

1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:46.600
- Hey Dej. What's up?

1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:48.670
- [Deja] Not much just bored.

1:01:48.670 --> 1:01:53.080
- Same. So going back to
church today felt really weird.

1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:54.170
- [Deja] Yeah, I agree.

1:01:54.170 --> 1:01:57.040
You should have seen the
look on Mrs. Robert's face.

1:01:57.040 --> 1:01:59.432
If looks could kill, you'd be dead.

1:01:59.432 --> 1:02:00.548
(instant message chimes)

1:02:00.548 --> 1:02:04.424
You would swear you were
sleeping with her husband.

1:02:04.424 --> 1:02:05.850
(instant message chimes)

1:02:05.850 --> 1:02:08.713
- Um...Mrs. Roberts really
creeped me out today.

1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:14.401
Usually she's so sweet,
but today she seemed off.

1:02:14.401 --> 1:02:16.273
- [Deja] That whole family's off.

1:02:17.479 --> 1:02:19.170
Super nice people creep me out.

1:02:19.170 --> 1:02:21.730
Nobody can be that nice all the time.

1:02:21.730 --> 1:02:24.760
- I guess. Are you still
coming over tonight?

1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:26.424
Dad's heading out of town soon.

1:02:26.424 --> 1:02:29.218
- [Deja] Yeah, once my mom
picks me up with the car.

1:02:29.218 --> 1:02:31.125
- Okay. See you later then.

1:02:31.125 --> 1:02:33.125
- [Deja] All right. Bye.

1:02:40.844 --> 1:02:45.835
(tense music coming from television)

1:02:48.930 --> 1:02:52.154
- [Clara] Watch out! Those birds are nuts.

1:02:52.154 --> 1:02:52.987
- Shhhhh!

1:02:54.580 --> 1:02:55.560
- Did you know that in Australia

1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:58.400
they have an actual swooping season?

1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:00.700
Magpies attack people
just like in this movie.

1:03:00.700 --> 1:03:03.324
- [Kimmy] Oh my God. You're such a nerd.

1:03:03.324 --> 1:03:04.907
- Didn't know...now, shhhh!

1:03:06.175 --> 1:03:07.023
(door bell rings)

1:03:07.023 --> 1:03:07.856
(Clara and Deja gasp)

1:03:11.743 --> 1:03:14.423
- It's just the pizza. I
completely forgot about it.

1:03:24.944 --> 1:03:28.310
Oh, hey, could you come inside

1:03:28.310 --> 1:03:29.760
so you don't let the bugs in?

1:03:30.970 --> 1:03:34.370
- Sure, didn't know you lived here.

1:03:34.370 --> 1:03:36.343
- I didn't know you delivered pizzas.

1:03:36.343 --> 1:03:40.040
- My parents wanted me to learn
more about responsibility,

1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:42.940
so... now I have a job.

1:03:42.940 --> 1:03:45.716
Your total will be $14.95.

1:03:48.100 --> 1:03:49.410
- Keep the change.

1:03:49.410 --> 1:03:51.295
- Thanks. See you around?

1:03:52.670 --> 1:03:54.916
- We have computer lab together.

1:03:54.916 --> 1:03:59.916
- Oh, you're right. Bye.

1:04:00.070 --> 1:04:00.903
- Bye.

1:04:06.331 --> 1:04:09.238
- I'm so stupid. Why did I say that?

1:04:11.170 --> 1:04:14.840
(ominous music)

1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:17.970
- You'll never guess who
delivered our pizzas.

1:04:17.970 --> 1:04:18.803
- Who?

1:04:19.860 --> 1:04:21.210
- Jacob.

1:04:21.210 --> 1:04:24.050
- Really? I never pictured
him as a delivery boy.

1:04:24.050 --> 1:04:25.806
- Well, what did you picture him as?

1:04:25.806 --> 1:04:28.916
- Hmm...future politician.
You know it's the hair.

1:04:29.905 --> 1:04:32.287
- (laughs) I don't know maybe a...

1:04:32.287 --> 1:04:33.750
(banging sound on back door)

1:04:33.750 --> 1:04:35.160
did you guys hear that?

1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:38.420
- It's probably the birds
coming to end us all.

1:04:38.420 --> 1:04:39.890
- Very funny.

1:04:39.890 --> 1:04:41.748
- I am funny...I'm really funny.

1:04:42.980 --> 1:04:44.462
- But I didn't hear anything.

1:04:44.462 --> 1:04:45.853
(scratching sound on front door)

1:04:45.853 --> 1:04:47.330
- That.

1:04:47.330 --> 1:04:49.400
- It's probably just a twig or something.

1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:50.985
- Or a bird.

1:04:50.985 --> 1:04:52.700
(banging sound on front door)

1:04:52.700 --> 1:04:54.625
- Okay, definitely not a bird.

1:04:57.873 --> 1:05:00.265
(baseball bat rattles around in closet)

1:05:02.670 --> 1:05:05.740
- Clara I don't wanna end up
like the next slasher film.

1:05:05.740 --> 1:05:07.150
Clara don't!

1:05:07.150 --> 1:05:09.070
- Seriously Clara, why don't
you just call the cops?

1:05:09.070 --> 1:05:11.040
I'm not trying to die today.

1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:12.691
- Clara don't!

1:05:12.691 --> 1:05:17.666
(suspenseful music)

1:05:19.096 --> 1:05:20.779
(front door opens quickly)

1:05:22.590 --> 1:05:24.323
- What the fuck?!?

1:05:27.038 --> 1:05:27.960
(fire sizzles as water is poured on it)

1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:29.750
- You don't think it was Jacob do you?

1:05:29.750 --> 1:05:31.200
- No, it wasn't him.

1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:33.910
- How do you know?
- I just do.

1:05:33.910 --> 1:05:36.810
Look, I need to clean this up
or my dad's gonna freak out.

1:05:39.580 --> 1:05:41.973
- Hello? Is anyone out there?

1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:44.645
Whoever you are you're not funny.

1:05:44.645 --> 1:05:46.654
(ominous music)

1:05:46.654 --> 1:05:49.004
(leaves crackling in the distance)

1:05:50.470 --> 1:05:52.050
Don't do that!

1:05:52.050 --> 1:05:52.883
- Sorry!

1:05:53.800 --> 1:05:54.816
Did you see anything?

1:05:54.816 --> 1:05:57.732
- No, just heard a noise,
probably just a cat or something.

1:05:57.732 --> 1:06:00.332
Let's just get this done,
I wanna go back inside.

1:06:00.332 --> 1:06:01.165
- Okay.

1:06:02.571 --> 1:06:04.819
(sweeping sounds)

1:06:04.819 --> 1:06:05.652
Ugh...gross.

1:06:07.872 --> 1:06:09.576
(door shuts loudly)

1:06:09.576 --> 1:06:11.790
I think I've had enough
scary movies for one night.

1:06:11.790 --> 1:06:14.390
- Honestly, I was just
about to say the same thing.

1:06:14.390 --> 1:06:16.760
- Wanna watch something funny before bed?

1:06:16.760 --> 1:06:19.100
- Read my mind.
(both laughs)

1:06:19.100 --> 1:06:22.470
- Well, I think that's
enough fun for tonight.

1:06:22.470 --> 1:06:24.450
I'm freaked the fuck out and
I have worked in the morning.

1:06:24.450 --> 1:06:27.170
So I will be taking this.

1:06:27.170 --> 1:06:28.961
- Deserter.
- I'm a survivalist.

1:06:28.961 --> 1:06:30.047
- "Bock bock".

1:06:30.047 --> 1:06:32.380
- "Bock Bock"..nuhhhh...See
you guys later.

1:06:33.970 --> 1:06:35.123
- What a weird night.

1:06:36.813 --> 1:06:41.796
(ominous music)

1:06:45.832 --> 1:06:50.832
(gossip and chatter in the background)

1:06:55.550 --> 1:06:57.250
- Why is everyone staring?

1:06:57.250 --> 1:06:58.696
- I don't know.

1:06:58.696 --> 1:07:03.471
(ominous music)

1:07:07.080 --> 1:07:09.660
- [Mean Girl #4] No way, I'm
not doing that. That's mean.

1:07:09.660 --> 1:07:10.963
- [Mean Girl #3] Fine. Then I will.

1:07:11.890 --> 1:07:12.723
Skank.

1:07:13.570 --> 1:07:14.520
- What did you say?!?

1:07:16.083 --> 1:07:19.660
- I said... skank!

1:07:19.660 --> 1:07:20.957
- What's that?

1:07:20.957 --> 1:07:23.340
(mean girls laugh)

1:07:23.340 --> 1:07:25.419
You guys are dicks!

1:07:25.419 --> 1:07:27.085
[Mean Girl #4] - We didn't print them.

1:07:32.830 --> 1:07:34.890
- Damn, look who's
desperate for attention.

1:07:34.890 --> 1:07:37.046
Is that how you get guys now?

1:07:37.046 --> 1:07:38.940
- If I find out you had
anything to do with this,

1:07:38.940 --> 1:07:40.020
I'll beat your ass.

1:07:40.020 --> 1:07:41.457
- I'm not afraid of you.
- You should be.

1:07:41.457 --> 1:07:43.090
- I like you all fiery, Deja.

1:07:43.090 --> 1:07:44.440
Maybe you could show me in another way.

1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:45.274
(thud to Chad's groin)

1:07:45.274 --> 1:07:46.440
(Chad groans)

1:07:46.440 --> 1:07:48.590
- If you ever bother her
again, I'll kill you!

1:07:49.595 --> 1:07:51.528
- Damn dude, you just got dropped.

1:07:51.528 --> 1:07:52.361
- Shut up.

1:07:52.361 --> 1:07:54.180
- Aww, we both know you
ain't got none anyway.

1:07:54.180 --> 1:07:56.397
- Just another psycho...lets go.

1:07:58.026 --> 1:08:02.967
(gentle music)

1:08:06.551 --> 1:08:07.384
- Clara.

1:08:08.413 --> 1:08:09.683
Are you okay?

1:08:11.180 --> 1:08:12.822
- No, I'm not.

1:08:12.822 --> 1:08:16.210
- Okay. Why don't you come
and take a walk with me

1:08:16.210 --> 1:08:19.280
and we can talk where
there's less prying eyes.

1:08:19.280 --> 1:08:20.113
Come on.

1:08:25.312 --> 1:08:28.830
Look, we can go over there
and talk on that bench, okay?

1:08:28.830 --> 1:08:30.313
Come on, I have some time.

1:08:32.349 --> 1:08:37.349
(gentle music)

1:08:49.267 --> 1:08:50.467
Come on, we have a seat.

1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:59.537
Do you wanna tell me what happened?

1:09:04.490 --> 1:09:05.686
- It's embarrassing.

1:09:08.020 --> 1:09:10.235
- I can't help you if you don't let me in.

1:09:11.925 --> 1:09:13.258
I do want to help.

1:09:23.827 --> 1:09:27.120
But there's nothing covered
up that will not be revealed

1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:28.820
and hidden that will not be known.

1:09:30.100 --> 1:09:30.933
- What?

1:09:32.620 --> 1:09:34.440
- The Bible verse at the
bottom of the picture,

1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:35.760
Luke 12:2.

1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:37.123
- What does it mean?

1:09:38.561 --> 1:09:41.390
- Well, Clara, it looks
like somebody thinks

1:09:41.390 --> 1:09:43.140
you have a secret they want shared.

1:09:44.550 --> 1:09:45.870
Do you have a secret, Clara?

1:09:45.870 --> 1:09:47.700
- What? No!

1:09:47.700 --> 1:09:49.620
Why does it even matter?

1:09:49.620 --> 1:09:51.340
Somebody took my picture

1:09:51.340 --> 1:09:53.553
and shared it without my permission.

1:09:54.790 --> 1:09:56.088
I'm gonna go call my dad.

1:09:56.088 --> 1:09:58.735
Um...Thanks for sitting with me.

1:09:58.735 --> 1:10:03.735
(ominous music)

1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:07.736
- Lying lips are an
abomination to the Lord.

1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:12.240
- [Mr. Banks] Honey, did
Chad take these photos?

1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:14.163
- No, I don't know who did it.

1:10:14.163 --> 1:10:15.621
- [Mr. Banks] Okay, well
I'm literally rushing to

1:10:15.621 --> 1:10:17.490
check out of the hotel now and head home.

1:10:17.490 --> 1:10:20.130
- No, you don't need to rush home

1:10:20.130 --> 1:10:22.603
but can you call the school?

1:10:24.260 --> 1:10:26.200
I can't go back there.

1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:28.280
[Mr. Banks] - Yeah, I'll take care of it.

1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:30.705
- Okay, thanks.

1:10:30.705 --> 1:10:32.405
[Mr. Banks] - We'll figure
this out, sweetheart.

1:10:34.330 --> 1:10:37.574
I love you. Be safe and
you remember you call me

1:10:37.574 --> 1:10:39.780
if anything else happens, okay?

1:10:39.780 --> 1:10:41.943
- Okay. I'll see you Thursday.

1:10:45.292 --> 1:10:50.192
(somber music)

1:11:06.483 --> 1:11:09.714
(typing on keyboard)

1:11:09.714 --> 1:11:12.214
(instant message chimes)

1:11:14.507 --> 1:11:15.840
(instant message chimes)

1:11:21.341 --> 1:11:22.924
(instant message chimes)

1:11:24.850 --> 1:11:25.683
(instant message chimes)

1:11:30.374 --> 1:11:31.207
(instant message chimes)

1:11:34.090 --> 1:11:37.769
- Are you kidding me? What's
with all the victim shaming?

1:11:37.769 --> 1:11:40.460
(typing on keyboard)

1:11:40.460 --> 1:11:41.768
(instant message chimes)

1:11:46.542 --> 1:11:48.959
(intense ominous music)

1:11:50.340 --> 1:11:51.593
Yes you are.

1:11:57.270 --> 1:11:59.703
This day fucking blows.

1:12:08.421 --> 1:12:11.265
(door bell rings)

1:12:11.265 --> 1:12:13.973
(gentle music)

1:12:15.157 --> 1:12:16.980
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:12:16.980 --> 1:12:17.813
- Come in.

1:12:26.846 --> 1:12:29.360
- You all right?
- No, I'm mortified.

1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:31.646
I can never show my face there again.

1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:35.492
- We could get you a mask.

1:12:35.492 --> 1:12:38.170
- You're not helping.
- Sorry.

1:12:38.170 --> 1:12:40.121
Just trying to lighten up the mood.

1:12:40.121 --> 1:12:43.559
I, um...

1:12:43.559 --> 1:12:45.787
got your homework.
- Thanks.

1:12:48.550 --> 1:12:49.940
- What did your dad say?

1:12:49.940 --> 1:12:52.810
- Honestly, it was like an interrogation.

1:12:52.810 --> 1:12:53.643
- Really?

1:12:53.643 --> 1:12:57.010
- Yeah. It seems like everybody's
pointing the finger at me.

1:12:57.010 --> 1:12:58.960
It's not like I asked for this.

1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:00.990
- Who's pointing the finger at you, Clara?

1:13:00.990 --> 1:13:04.030
- Just stop, okay?

1:13:04.030 --> 1:13:07.053
It's it's fine..just..I want to be alone!

1:13:08.070 --> 1:13:09.953
- All right, then I'll go.

1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:15.023
- Deja wait, wait come back.

1:13:16.110 --> 1:13:20.230
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you.

1:13:20.230 --> 1:13:21.930
- It's okay, I get it.

1:13:21.930 --> 1:13:25.010
I would want to be alone
after a day like today.

1:13:25.010 --> 1:13:27.650
- Thank you for bringing me my homework.

1:13:27.650 --> 1:13:28.733
- No problem.

1:13:29.770 --> 1:13:31.120
You still want me to
come with you tomorrow

1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:32.410
to pick up your car?

1:13:32.410 --> 1:13:34.563
- Of course.
- All right.

1:13:36.140 --> 1:13:38.615
- See you later.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1:13:45.065 --> 1:13:50.040
(ominous tone)

1:13:57.762 --> 1:14:02.754
(dogs barking in the background)

1:14:07.423 --> 1:14:10.082
(water boiling)

1:14:10.082 --> 1:14:15.032
(crackers breaking)

1:14:20.060 --> 1:14:22.838
- Looks like it's just you
and me again tonight, Fish.

1:14:22.838 --> 1:14:25.505
(knocking on door)

1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:48.478
Hello?

1:14:50.540 --> 1:14:52.221
Is anybody there?

1:14:52.221 --> 1:14:57.221
(ominous music)

1:14:57.810 --> 1:14:59.277
Whatever.

1:14:59.277 --> 1:15:04.219
(ominous music)

1:15:24.426 --> 1:15:25.259
(Clara sighs)

1:15:37.002 --> 1:15:38.044
(light switch clicks off)

1:15:43.383 --> 1:15:48.349
(intense ominous music)

1:15:51.944 --> 1:15:54.777
(water running)

1:16:17.817 --> 1:16:22.641
(suspenseful music)

1:16:46.784 --> 1:16:51.758
(suspenseful music)

1:17:00.692 --> 1:17:05.642
(music plays on earbuds)

1:17:15.229 --> 1:17:20.188
(ominous music)

1:17:34.623 --> 1:17:39.606
(suspenseful music)

1:17:53.917 --> 1:17:58.900
(suspenseful music intensifies)

1:18:04.377 --> 1:18:05.210
(music stops suddenly)

1:18:26.646 --> 1:18:31.587
(ominous music)

1:18:33.603 --> 1:18:34.436
- What the hell?

1:18:35.936 --> 1:18:38.036
(doorknob rattles)

1:18:38.036 --> 1:18:43.028
(suspenseful music)

1:18:56.744 --> 1:19:00.065
(suspenseful music intensifies)

1:19:00.065 --> 1:19:02.015
(doorknob rattles violently)

1:19:06.066 --> 1:19:09.791
(screams) I thought you
were here to kill me.

1:19:09.791 --> 1:19:10.820
- What the hell happened?

1:19:10.820 --> 1:19:13.050
- I woke up in that was in my floor.

1:19:13.050 --> 1:19:15.080
- Is that blood, who did this?

1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:16.120
- I don't know.

1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:17.625
- We should call the cops.

1:19:17.625 --> 1:19:19.058
(phone dials 911)

1:19:19.980 --> 1:19:22.060
- [911 Responder] Eden
911, what's your location?

1:19:22.060 --> 1:19:23.690
- Hi, this is Deja Parker,

1:19:23.690 --> 1:19:27.900
I'm at 1975 Hallow
Drive, um, someone has...

1:19:27.900 --> 1:19:29.600
- You think it was a prank?

1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:30.940
- No, I don't.

1:19:30.940 --> 1:19:31.773
- All right, ladies,

1:19:31.773 --> 1:19:34.210
it looks like everything's clear in there.

1:19:34.210 --> 1:19:36.120
If you guys have anything
else you'd like to add,

1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:38.330
just feel free to call
down to the station.

1:19:38.330 --> 1:19:40.995
- Um...okay?
- All right. Thank you.

1:19:40.995 --> 1:19:41.828
- Bye.

1:19:44.870 --> 1:19:48.580
Seriously, that didn't
make me feel any better.

1:19:48.580 --> 1:19:50.220
I thought they would've
had the whole team out here

1:19:50.220 --> 1:19:51.400
searching for fingerprints.

1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:53.270
- I guess that just happens on TV.

1:19:53.270 --> 1:19:54.910
Are you gonna call your dad?

1:19:54.910 --> 1:19:55.910
- There's no point.

1:19:55.910 --> 1:19:57.330
He'll probably just think it was a prank

1:19:57.330 --> 1:19:58.600
just like the stupid cops.

1:19:58.600 --> 1:20:00.440
- I guess, but don't you think it's weird

1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:02.290
it said Jezebel like your email?

1:20:02.290 --> 1:20:04.860
You sure you didn't attract a stalker?

1:20:04.860 --> 1:20:06.821
- That's not possible,
how would they find me?

1:20:06.821 --> 1:20:08.071
- I don't know.
(car horn honks)

1:20:15.694 --> 1:20:17.777
What are they doing here?

1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:26.560
- Hey, Mrs. Roberts.
Jacob.

1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:27.590
- Hello, Clara dear.

1:20:27.590 --> 1:20:29.140
Just coming by to check on you.

1:20:29.140 --> 1:20:30.560
You know, after yesterday.

1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:32.080
- Oh yeah...uh, thanks...

1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:33.540
- We were actually just leaving.

1:20:33.540 --> 1:20:35.160
We need to go pick up Clara's car

1:20:35.160 --> 1:20:37.440
and our Uber will be here any moment.

1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:39.450
- Oh, we can take you guys, right mama?

1:20:39.450 --> 1:20:41.740
- Of course, I'd love to.

1:20:41.740 --> 1:20:44.210
- We really wouldn't wanna
take up too much of your time,

1:20:44.210 --> 1:20:45.240
but thank you so much.

1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:46.790
- Nonsense, we're already here.

1:20:48.850 --> 1:20:51.692
- Oh, okay. Uh...Sure. Yeah.
- Great.

1:20:51.692 --> 1:20:53.563
All right. Come on girls.

1:20:57.578 --> 1:21:02.294
(van pulling in off busy highway)

1:21:09.210 --> 1:21:11.463
- [Clara] Thank you so much for taking us.

1:21:11.463 --> 1:21:13.380
- [Mrs. Roberts] No problem, girls.

1:21:23.983 --> 1:21:25.233
- So what are you wearing?

1:21:26.101 --> 1:21:27.310
(air wrenches in the background)

1:21:27.310 --> 1:21:28.253
Sounds hot.

1:21:29.310 --> 1:21:31.610
So you ready for me to come over later?

1:21:31.610 --> 1:21:32.770
- He's such a pig.

1:21:32.770 --> 1:21:34.420
- I just wanna get my car and go.

1:21:35.780 --> 1:21:36.733
- I got this.

1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:42.970
Are you serious? Why
are you so lame, Chad?

1:21:42.970 --> 1:21:44.560
- Why you got to be such a bitch, Deja?

1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:46.310
- At least I don't pretend to get action.

1:21:46.310 --> 1:21:47.870
- Guys, just stop!

1:21:47.870 --> 1:21:50.242
I wanna get my car and go.

1:21:50.242 --> 1:21:52.210
- Pfft! What car?

1:21:52.210 --> 1:21:55.540
- Oh, hey Mom, Clara forgot her phone.

1:21:55.540 --> 1:21:57.736
I'm gonna go bring it to her.
I'll be back in a minute.

1:22:01.460 --> 1:22:04.036
Clara, you forgot your phone in the car.

1:22:05.620 --> 1:22:09.080
- Wow. So you dating this Jesus freak now?

1:22:09.080 --> 1:22:11.460
You really move on to dick fast, huh?

1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:12.790
- What is wrong with you?

1:22:12.790 --> 1:22:14.488
- Thank you, Jacob.

1:22:14.488 --> 1:22:16.700
- Um...Do you guys have a bathroom?

1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:19.998
- Yeah, it's along the
side of the building.

1:22:24.290 --> 1:22:26.210
- The bathroom isn't on
the side of the building.

1:22:26.210 --> 1:22:28.000
- I know
- You're so mean.

1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:29.300
- And you're such a skank.

1:22:30.850 --> 1:22:32.160
- Micah, can I get those keys

1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:34.750
before I end up with an assault charge?

1:22:34.750 --> 1:22:35.583
- [Micah] Yeah.

1:22:39.100 --> 1:22:42.120
- You just need to sign right here.

1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:46.580
Let's see, James Burke,
Christopher Wilson,

1:22:46.580 --> 1:22:50.053
Misty Bowles, Clara Banks...

1:22:51.010 --> 1:22:53.110
sign right there and you'll be good to go.

1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:02.010
- Hey, you okay?

1:23:02.010 --> 1:23:04.280
- Yeah. I tripped on the way back here.

1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:07.050
- Hon, you got something on your shirt.

1:23:07.050 --> 1:23:09.400
- Can we just go?
- Yeah.

1:23:10.248 --> 1:23:13.415
(car engine cranking)

1:23:23.894 --> 1:23:28.894
- I know...
Why would he call me that?

1:23:28.986 --> 1:23:30.569
I don't understand!

1:23:34.700 --> 1:23:37.070
(radio static)

1:23:37.070 --> 1:23:39.410
- [Reporter] It's 5:30. This is Tim chase.

1:23:39.410 --> 1:23:41.550
The Eden Police Department
is investigating

1:23:41.550 --> 1:23:44.650
the second murder to occur
within the last seven days.

1:23:44.650 --> 1:23:46.400
A spokesperson for the department said,

1:23:46.400 --> 1:23:48.830
it's the first time in 22 years

1:23:48.830 --> 1:23:51.180
that back-to-back murders have occurred.

1:23:51.180 --> 1:23:52.760
Now they state there's no cause

1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:55.220
to think the murders
are in any way related?

1:23:55.220 --> 1:23:57.210
Well, we'll just have to
take their word on that,

1:23:57.210 --> 1:23:59.830
but keep your doors locked
tonight, Eden. Be safe.

1:23:59.830 --> 1:24:01.260
Let's lighten things back up now.

1:24:01.260 --> 1:24:03.840
Continuing their run in the
number one Billboard spot,

1:24:03.840 --> 1:24:06.030
it's Sabell with the song...

1:24:06.030 --> 1:24:08.320
- Maybe that psycho will get Chad next.

1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:12.500
- I wish. He's such a dick.
I can't believe I dated him.

1:24:14.212 --> 1:24:17.854
(car veers around curve fast)

1:24:17.854 --> 1:24:21.210
(engine accelerating)

1:24:21.210 --> 1:24:23.450
- He was just foul back there.

1:24:23.450 --> 1:24:26.250
Speaking of foul, it smells
like something died in here.

1:24:27.311 --> 1:24:29.510
(bottle sprays)

1:24:29.510 --> 1:24:30.560
Well, that didn't help,

1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:32.580
now it smells like death and flowers.

1:24:32.580 --> 1:24:33.910
- Just my freaking luck.

1:24:33.910 --> 1:24:36.284
Can this day get any worse?

1:24:36.284 --> 1:24:38.410
(car speeds by fast)

1:24:38.410 --> 1:24:40.207
- Forget that jerk, he isn't worth it

1:24:40.207 --> 1:24:41.970
and he definitely isn't worth our lives.

1:24:41.970 --> 1:24:43.618
Slow down, speedy.

1:24:45.806 --> 1:24:46.639
(brake pedal goes to floor)

1:24:46.639 --> 1:24:48.305
- Uh...Dej?

1:24:48.305 --> 1:24:49.740
- Clara, slow down.

1:24:49.740 --> 1:24:51.500
- I can't!
- What?!?

1:24:51.500 --> 1:24:53.458
- The brakes aren't working!

1:24:53.458 --> 1:24:55.752
(pneumatic air sounds)

1:24:55.752 --> 1:24:58.151
Deja, what do I do? Nothing is working!

1:24:58.151 --> 1:25:00.477
- I don't know, I don't know!

1:25:00.477 --> 1:25:03.785
Oh my God, we're going
to hit them! (screams)

1:25:05.154 --> 1:25:06.037
- Clara, we're going to hit
the pole! Oh my God, Oh my God!

1:25:06.037 --> 1:25:06.904
(parking brake pulled)

1:25:06.904 --> 1:25:09.520
(car crashing)

1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:14.128
(car idles)

1:25:14.128 --> 1:25:14.989
(car ignition turned off)

1:25:14.989 --> 1:25:18.142
(ominous music)

1:25:18.142 --> 1:25:20.892
(birds chirping)

1:25:27.946 --> 1:25:31.123
- Mom? we were just in an accident.

1:25:35.026 --> 1:25:40.001
We're at Old Blair road...Old
Alabama/Blair road...

1:25:40.913 --> 1:25:41.963
Okay.

1:25:44.542 --> 1:25:49.525
(ominous music)

1:25:50.866 --> 1:25:53.837
Clara?

1:25:53.837 --> 1:25:55.254
My Mom is coming.

1:25:57.203 --> 1:26:00.490
Clara?
- Okay.

1:26:00.490 --> 1:26:04.826
Um...I just need to get my purse.

1:26:06.354 --> 1:26:08.312
(keys jerked out of ignition)

1:26:33.187 --> 1:26:35.878
(ominous music intensifies)

1:26:35.878 --> 1:26:37.710
- [Deja] What's wrong?

1:26:37.710 --> 1:26:39.195
- Oh my God...what?

1:26:42.420 --> 1:26:43.253
- What's that?

1:26:46.371 --> 1:26:49.038
(Clara panting)

1:26:55.426 --> 1:26:58.176
(birds chirping)

1:27:01.671 --> 1:27:06.555
(police sirens)

1:27:08.399 --> 1:27:13.082
(gentle music)

1:27:15.910 --> 1:27:18.910
- So Ms. Banks, can you think of anyone

1:27:18.910 --> 1:27:19.743
that would wanna hurt you?

1:27:19.743 --> 1:27:22.388
- No, I get along with most people.

1:27:23.660 --> 1:27:25.103
- [Investigator] Most people.

1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:29.480
- I mean recently my
boyfriend Chad, and I broke up

1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:32.766
and he did send me a text
saying that I would regret it.

1:27:32.766 --> 1:27:33.599
- What?

1:27:33.599 --> 1:27:35.840
- Is this the same Chad
that works at the garage

1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:37.420
that recently worked on your vehicle?

1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:38.445
- Yes.

1:27:38.445 --> 1:27:40.132
- You didn't think to tell me about that?

1:27:40.132 --> 1:27:41.399
- Dad...it's fine.

1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:43.993
- Okay.

1:27:44.910 --> 1:27:46.970
Well, Ms. Banks, I think
that's all we need for now.

1:27:46.970 --> 1:27:47.803
- No, it's not.

1:27:47.803 --> 1:27:49.520
You're gonna go arrest
this guy, aren't you?

1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:51.600
- Mr. Banks first, we have
to question everyone involved

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:53.710
to further our investigation.

1:27:53.710 --> 1:27:55.880
- He tried to kill my baby girl!

1:27:55.880 --> 1:27:57.323
Do you understand that?

1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:01.150
- Mr. Banks though I do
understand your anger,

1:28:01.150 --> 1:28:02.550
please understand that we have to review

1:28:02.550 --> 1:28:03.633
all of the evidence.

1:28:04.670 --> 1:28:06.230
- Yeah.

1:28:06.230 --> 1:28:07.920
- Clara, are you ready?

1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:09.553
Let's go.
- Okay.

1:28:19.041 --> 1:28:20.891
(tense music)

1:28:20.891 --> 1:28:22.327
- If you ever come near my daughter again,

1:28:22.327 --> 1:28:24.296
and I swear to God-
- Get your hands-

1:28:24.296 --> 1:28:25.335
(both scuffle)

1:28:25.335 --> 1:28:27.438
- [Detective] Hey! Hey! Hey!
I cannot believe this...

1:28:27.438 --> 1:28:30.002
- Enough! Get in there!

1:28:30.002 --> 1:28:31.243
Get in there!

1:28:33.656 --> 1:28:34.906
Have a seat.

1:28:38.270 --> 1:28:41.340
Do you even know why you
were brought in today?

1:28:41.340 --> 1:28:42.173
- I don't know.

1:28:42.173 --> 1:28:43.180
Maybe because my ex is a bitch

1:28:43.180 --> 1:28:45.160
that whines over stupid shit.

1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:46.750
- You think what happened was stupid?

1:28:46.750 --> 1:28:49.560
- Yeah, since when was dog shit on fire

1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:51.950
and a mouse prank
warrant an interrogation?

1:28:51.950 --> 1:28:53.333
- Chad shut your mouth.

1:28:54.210 --> 1:28:57.300
Listen, if you wanna charge
my son with anything,

1:28:57.300 --> 1:28:58.930
you can speak with our lawyer.

1:28:58.930 --> 1:29:00.780
- Sir, we are questioning everyone

1:29:00.780 --> 1:29:03.010
that came in contact
with Ms. Banks vehicle.

1:29:03.010 --> 1:29:06.123
We're not charging your
son with anything, yet.

1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:10.821
But if you feel you need a
lawyer, no one's stopping you.

1:29:11.830 --> 1:29:13.130
- Are we done?

1:29:13.130 --> 1:29:14.423
- I have another question.

1:29:16.150 --> 1:29:18.290
Chad, did you cut Clara's brake lines?

1:29:18.290 --> 1:29:23.166
- What? No. Dad I swear-
- Son I know. Are we done yet?

1:29:24.030 --> 1:29:26.460
- I have what I need at the moment.

1:29:26.460 --> 1:29:28.533
- Then we're leaving. Chad let's go.

1:29:32.270 --> 1:29:35.281
- Mr. Michaels, don't leave town.

1:29:36.200 --> 1:29:38.013
I might still need some more information.

1:29:41.361 --> 1:29:43.111
(crickets chirping)

1:29:46.060 --> 1:29:48.454
- I cannot believe that
the day is almost over.

1:29:48.454 --> 1:29:49.804
You want me to make you something to eat?

1:29:49.804 --> 1:29:52.350
- No, I'm just gonna go up to my room.

1:29:52.350 --> 1:29:55.271
- Clara, you know you
can talk to me, right?

1:29:55.271 --> 1:29:56.104
- I know.

1:30:06.544 --> 1:30:11.528
(sorrowful music)

1:30:31.394 --> 1:30:32.644
I miss you mom...

1:30:33.727 --> 1:30:35.344
I really need you right now.

1:30:35.344 --> 1:30:38.678

1:30:49.014 --> 1:30:50.255
(cabinet shuts)

1:30:55.940 --> 1:30:57.190
- I feel bad for the kid.

1:30:58.540 --> 1:30:59.373
- Feel bad for whom?

1:30:59.373 --> 1:31:01.673
- I feel bad for Clara, of course.

1:31:02.583 --> 1:31:04.310
- Why?

1:31:04.310 --> 1:31:05.940
- Well, she must be scared.

1:31:05.940 --> 1:31:07.290
Accidents are always scary.

1:31:09.630 --> 1:31:11.480
We should add her to our prayer list.

1:31:12.515 --> 1:31:15.050
- I'll pray she stays
away from my husband.

1:31:15.050 --> 1:31:16.210
- I'm sorry, what was that hon?

1:31:16.210 --> 1:31:17.688
- I was agreeing with you.

1:31:19.250 --> 1:31:21.800
- Well, I'll be back in a few hours.

1:31:21.800 --> 1:31:22.645
- Where are you going?

1:31:22.645 --> 1:31:25.500
- Uh...Bowling with the boys.

1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:27.383
- Bowling, I thought that was on Friday.

1:31:27.383 --> 1:31:29.270
- With Halloween being
on Friday this year,

1:31:29.270 --> 1:31:31.730
we just thought we'd just
go ahead and go tonight.

1:31:31.730 --> 1:31:34.020
- Oh, okay.

1:31:34.020 --> 1:31:35.360
- Are...are you okay?

1:31:35.360 --> 1:31:36.620
I can stay home if you'd like.

1:31:36.620 --> 1:31:39.949
- No, go have fun. Tell the boys said hi.

1:31:39.949 --> 1:31:41.090
- Okay

[Voice in Mrs. Roberts Head]
Oh, let's pray for Clara.

1:31:58.330 --> 1:32:01.253
Yeah Clara must've been so scared!

1:32:03.050 --> 1:32:06.250
Poor Clara, there's
nothing poor about that

1:32:06.250 --> 1:32:11.195
husband stealing witch. (water splashing)

1:32:14.580 --> 1:32:17.638
He never changes bowling
night, what am I thinking?

1:32:18.920 --> 1:32:22.260
He's probably meeting
up with her right now.

1:32:27.642 --> 1:32:31.142
(ominous music)

1:32:32.216 --> 1:32:34.124
(dogs barking in the distance)

1:32:35.307 --> 1:32:38.482
- Huh..Jezebel and Clara
have a lot in common.

1:32:39.532 --> 1:32:41.157
Both are harlots.

1:32:41.157 --> 1:32:42.060
(finger taps Bible)

1:32:42.060 --> 1:32:46.500
But Jezebel fell and
one day Clara will too.

1:32:48.030 --> 1:32:50.776
Everything unholy will come to light.

1:32:52.472 --> 1:32:55.305

1:33:07.829 --> 1:33:10.329
(tense music)

1:33:12.240 --> 1:33:13.073
- Clara?

1:33:16.729 --> 1:33:18.250
What are you doing here?

1:33:18.250 --> 1:33:19.920
- I think you know.

1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:21.970
- No, I don't.

1:33:21.970 --> 1:33:24.600
We're supposed to meet
at the church tomorrow.

1:33:24.600 --> 1:33:28.993
- My sweet Bett...my
plans are not with you.

1:33:31.350 --> 1:33:32.946
Is your husband home?

1:33:34.140 --> 1:33:36.930
- You stay away from my husband.

1:33:36.930 --> 1:33:39.320
I think I've been more
than patient with you.

1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:42.170
- (scoffs) Funny you say patient,

1:33:42.170 --> 1:33:44.433
we played doctor just the other day.

1:33:45.700 --> 1:33:47.013
- What's wrong with you?

1:33:47.900 --> 1:33:52.476
- Wrong? Nothing's wrong.

1:33:52.476 --> 1:33:56.476
It felt so right.

1:33:56.476 --> 1:34:00.530
- You bitch! Stay away from my family,

1:34:00.530 --> 1:34:02.125
You stay away from my husband!

1:34:02.125 --> 1:34:06.216
You are nothing but a harlot of Babylon.

1:34:07.390 --> 1:34:11.810
- Um...Mom, who are you talking to?

1:34:11.810 --> 1:34:15.629
- Clara is here.
- No, she's not.

1:34:15.629 --> 1:34:19.700
- But she's right, no, no...she...

1:34:19.700 --> 1:34:21.713
She's was right here!

1:34:21.713 --> 1:34:23.996
I...uh...

1:34:23.996 --> 1:34:27.054
No... she was right here!

1:34:27.054 --> 1:34:28.454
My God...I..

1:34:30.221 --> 1:34:31.962
(pill bottle rattles)

1:34:31.962 --> 1:34:33.470
- [Jacob] Do you want me to
help you walk you to bed?

1:34:33.470 --> 1:34:37.237
- No. I'm fine, it's...um...

1:34:37.237 --> 1:34:38.928
It's okay. Goodnight.

1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:43.850
Don't get too close to Clara, son.

1:34:43.850 --> 1:34:45.905
She's a weed in God's garden.

1:34:54.978 --> 1:34:57.728
(birds chirping)

1:35:01.232 --> 1:35:03.373
- Hey guys?
- Oh my God, Clara.

1:35:04.466 --> 1:35:07.057
- I am so happy you're not dead!

1:35:07.057 --> 1:35:08.560
- Me too.

1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:11.326
- Oh man, I was so worried about you.

1:35:11.326 --> 1:35:13.951
(Pickup truck passes by)

1:35:17.428 --> 1:35:18.261
[Deja] - Feel better?

1:35:18.261 --> 1:35:19.462
[Clara] - Yeah

1:35:19.462 --> 1:35:21.603
[Kimmy] - Seriously...can
you learn how to drive?

1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:25.143
- What is he doing here?

1:35:27.060 --> 1:35:29.820
- Mr. Green, I'm so glad you're here.

1:35:29.820 --> 1:35:31.530
Well, we shouldn't be here too long today.

1:35:31.530 --> 1:35:32.960
We'd like to put up
most of the decorations

1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:34.160
right before the event starts,

1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:35.230
but things like the banners

1:35:35.230 --> 1:35:37.600
we like to put up the day before.

1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:39.994
Jacob, can you help me with that ladder?

1:35:39.994 --> 1:35:40.827
- Okay.

1:35:42.410 --> 1:35:43.890
- You can join the rest of the group.

1:35:43.890 --> 1:35:45.690
I'm sure you already know everybody.

1:35:51.540 --> 1:35:53.678
- Hey.
- Hey Micah.

1:35:54.980 --> 1:35:59.980
- Hey..um...Deja, can I
talk to you for a minute?

1:36:00.257 --> 1:36:02.407
- You can say whatever
you want right here.

1:36:03.330 --> 1:36:04.921
- Okay...umm...

1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:09.503
I..uh...wanted to say I was sorry.

1:36:10.380 --> 1:36:13.421
- I shouldn't have messed
with your grades like that.

1:36:15.339 --> 1:36:17.460
- What?!?
- He said he was sorry.

1:36:17.460 --> 1:36:18.293
- And?!?

1:36:22.350 --> 1:36:24.660
- So...you wanna tell me how you did that?

1:36:24.660 --> 1:36:27.130
Because my grades could use
a little bit of a pick-me-up,

1:36:27.130 --> 1:36:28.080
if you know what I'm saying...

1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:29.070
- I...um...
- Don't worry.

1:36:29.070 --> 1:36:31.900
I'm not trying to hit on
you. You're not my type.

1:36:31.900 --> 1:36:34.610
- Don't take it personal,
no man's her type.

1:36:34.610 --> 1:36:35.693
- That's true.

1:36:39.773 --> 1:36:42.200
- Hey everyone, well, here's the banners

1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:43.720
that we'll be painting.

1:36:43.720 --> 1:36:44.553
Once you get that done,

1:36:44.553 --> 1:36:46.420
we can hang it up above
the entrance, okay?

1:36:46.420 --> 1:36:48.010
I have some stuff to do inside,

1:36:48.010 --> 1:36:50.173
so if you need anything, just ask Jacob.

1:36:51.133 --> 1:36:52.432
(banner stuffed hard into Clara's stomach)

1:37:03.373 --> 1:37:06.374
- [Kimmy] Is this paint?
- [Clara] Yeah...

1:37:06.374 --> 1:37:11.316
(gentle upbeat music)

1:38:03.330 --> 1:38:06.483
- Wow. Great job guys,
it looks really good.

1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:09.350
You have paint on your shirt, Kimmy.

1:38:10.830 --> 1:38:13.620
- Oh man, this is my favorite jacket.

1:38:13.620 --> 1:38:14.830
- I can get that out for you.

1:38:14.830 --> 1:38:17.110
- No, it's fine. It's just a jacket.

1:38:17.110 --> 1:38:18.270
- No, I insist.

1:38:18.270 --> 1:38:21.610
Especially with all your help
today, I'll take care of it.

1:38:21.610 --> 1:38:22.748
Good job guys.

1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:28.930
- We did a really good job.
- Yeah we did.

1:38:28.930 --> 1:38:30.355
- What do you think, Kimmy?

1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.490
- Earth to Kimmy, you with us?

1:38:34.490 --> 1:38:37.070
- No, you guys are really boring.

1:38:37.070 --> 1:38:39.010
Did you hear about this
guy who got murdered?

1:38:39.010 --> 1:38:40.720
- There were two murders,

1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:42.960
and isn't that the one
that was on the news?

1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:46.810
- Yeah, actually it was
behind your house Jacob.

1:38:46.810 --> 1:38:49.210
- It was probably the guy
who broke into our shed.

1:38:49.210 --> 1:38:51.890
He stole a shovel and a couple of tools.

1:38:51.890 --> 1:38:53.280
Looks like Karma got him.

1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:56.070
- Wow, you're the last person
I expected to hear that from,

1:38:56.070 --> 1:38:58.700
aren't you supposed to be
all turn the other cheek?

1:38:58.700 --> 1:38:59.900
- Back in biblical times,

1:38:59.900 --> 1:39:02.120
you could kill a thief if
you caught them in the act.

1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:03.665
- That's a little harsh.

1:39:06.290 --> 1:39:08.290
- So are we gonna to put this banner up?

1:39:09.740 --> 1:39:10.573
Or what?

1:39:14.259 --> 1:39:17.770
(birds chirping)

1:39:17.770 --> 1:39:21.276
- what is this?
- Jack O'lantern pancakes!

1:39:21.276 --> 1:39:23.500
- It looks like a deranged clown.

1:39:23.500 --> 1:39:24.970
- Well let's hope that
these deranged clowns

1:39:24.970 --> 1:39:26.441
at least taste good.

1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.610
- I love you, dad.
- I love you too.

1:39:31.680 --> 1:39:35.289
So...uh...the sheriff
was here this morning

1:39:35.289 --> 1:39:37.810
and they're still looking
into trying to figure out,

1:39:37.810 --> 1:39:41.343
I guess, who was all
involved in that accident,

1:39:41.343 --> 1:39:44.060
but, the stay away order
has been placed on Chad.

1:39:44.060 --> 1:39:46.380
So he's not gonna be bothering you again.

1:39:46.380 --> 1:39:48.010
- Thank you.

1:39:48.010 --> 1:39:50.120
- I gotta protect my baby.

1:39:50.120 --> 1:39:52.950
All right, so listen, after
we get done with breakfast,

1:39:52.950 --> 1:39:56.610
I was thinking...maybe
we can carve our pumpkins

1:39:56.610 --> 1:39:57.820
and keep those demons away.

1:39:57.820 --> 1:40:01.193
- Honestly, that would be nice.

1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:07.050
These are pretty good.

1:40:07.050 --> 1:40:09.206
- Not bad for deranged clowns, right?

1:40:09.206 --> 1:40:11.198
- Right.

1:44:00.610 --> 1:44:01.850
- Good old days?

1:44:01.850 --> 1:44:04.890
- Yeah. You know, when people
used to go door to door.

1:44:04.890 --> 1:44:06.963
- Mom says this is much safer.

1:44:09.401 --> 1:44:10.234
- I guess.

1:44:16.996 --> 1:44:20.563
(ominous music)

1:44:24.730 --> 1:44:26.343
- You wanna see me die...

1:44:27.270 --> 1:44:28.103
don't you?

1:44:33.147 --> 1:44:35.163
You wanna watch me bleed.

1:44:36.709 --> 1:44:37.748
(laughs manically)

1:44:37.748 --> 1:44:38.581
- What?

1:44:44.101 --> 1:44:47.211
(tense music)

1:44:47.211 --> 1:44:48.461
(giggles manically)

1:44:51.516 --> 1:44:52.349
- Uh...

1:44:53.970 --> 1:44:55.746
- Hey! We're out of candy.

1:44:58.717 --> 1:44:59.950
- I...um...

1:45:01.770 --> 1:45:03.473
I'll be right there.

1:45:12.850 --> 1:45:17.613
- Mrs. Roberts, we were wondering
if we could go see Kimmy?

1:45:18.950 --> 1:45:21.883
- Yeah. It's fine, thanks for your help.

1:45:23.930 --> 1:45:25.310
- Where are they going?

1:45:25.310 --> 1:45:26.896
- To check on Kimmy.

1:45:26.896 --> 1:45:28.290
- Is she okay?

1:45:28.290 --> 1:45:30.030
- Well, she's supposed to be here today

1:45:30.030 --> 1:45:31.780
and they still haven't heard from her.

1:45:33.630 --> 1:45:36.772
I can stop at Clara's later
and check in on her, okay?

1:45:42.300 --> 1:45:45.910
- Oh, Hey Micah, can you pack
this up in the van for me?

1:45:45.910 --> 1:45:47.320
- Sure.

1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:48.540
- Hey, thanks for your help today.

1:45:48.540 --> 1:45:49.373
- No problem.

1:45:50.769 --> 1:45:55.485
(gentle music)

1:45:59.834 --> 1:46:00.784
- What the hell?

1:46:05.371 --> 1:46:10.279
(suspenseful music)

1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:18.530
- Shit! Dude.

1:46:18.530 --> 1:46:19.860
Didn't mean to scare you,

1:46:19.860 --> 1:46:22.310
mom wanted to know if you needed a ride.

1:46:22.310 --> 1:46:23.703
- No, I'm okay.

1:46:24.948 --> 1:46:25.960
- Are you sure?

1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:28.500
- Yeah...I uh, I think I'll walk.

1:46:28.500 --> 1:46:29.878
It's nice night for a walk.

1:46:29.878 --> 1:46:34.308
(gentle music)

1:46:34.308 --> 1:46:36.360
- [Clara] I can't
believe Kimmy ditched us.

1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:38.040
- [Deja] She probably
didn't wanna be caught dead

1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:39.570
in this angel costume.

1:46:39.570 --> 1:46:40.690
- I guess...

1:46:42.290 --> 1:46:44.628
- You sure you don't want
to go to the party with me?

1:46:44.628 --> 1:46:47.723
- [Clara] Yeah, I think
I'll just stay home.

1:46:47.723 --> 1:46:50.040
- All right. I'll head out then.

1:46:50.040 --> 1:46:51.770
- Okay. Be safe.

1:46:51.770 --> 1:46:54.200
- I will. Call me if you change your mind.

1:46:54.200 --> 1:46:55.033
- I will.

1:47:01.940 --> 1:47:05.341
Dad, are you home?

1:47:11.906 --> 1:47:16.898
(ominous music)

1:47:28.332 --> 1:47:30.847
(door bell rings)

1:47:30.847 --> 1:47:35.739
(ominous music)

1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:55.528
I guess those masks are popular this year.

1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:01.375
Aren't you a little too old
to be trick or treating?

1:48:01.375 --> 1:48:06.350
(tense music)

1:48:10.168 --> 1:48:11.860
You know what?

1:48:11.860 --> 1:48:15.823
It's whatever, we have candy left anyway.

1:48:16.996 --> 1:48:21.763
(tense music)

1:48:23.252 --> 1:48:24.095
(door slams)

1:48:24.095 --> 1:48:25.286
(candy grabbed hastily)

1:48:30.450 --> 1:48:34.410
Oh, ha ha. You're so scary.

1:48:34.410 --> 1:48:38.169
Just take the candy and go.

1:48:38.169 --> 1:48:40.430
Let go of me, what are you doing?

1:48:40.430 --> 1:48:44.963
Let go of... (screams)

1:48:46.185 --> 1:48:49.302
(stabbing sound)

1:48:49.302 --> 1:48:50.997
(kick impacts)

1:48:50.997 --> 1:48:52.164
(wall impact)

1:48:52.164 --> 1:48:56.072
(Clara weeps and pants)

1:48:56.072 --> 1:49:00.191
(music intensifies)

1:49:02.808 --> 1:49:07.807
(Clara gasps in pain)

1:49:21.226 --> 1:49:23.376
(door shut and locked)

1:49:55.833 --> 1:49:58.141
(knife scrapes along railing)

1:50:00.417 --> 1:50:05.417
(tense music intensifies)

1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:23.021
(doorknob rattles)

1:50:26.112 --> 1:50:28.462
(doorknob unlocks and door opens)

1:50:32.766 --> 1:50:37.100
(door creaks open)

1:50:47.861 --> 1:50:52.735
(crickets and dogs in background)

1:50:54.017 --> 1:50:55.683
(music stops)

1:51:09.428 --> 1:51:14.353
(footsteps squeak)

1:51:19.496 --> 1:51:22.846
(crickets and dogs in background)

1:51:29.867 --> 1:51:31.725
(Clara weeps)

1:51:42.446 --> 1:51:47.129
(tense music resumes)

1:51:48.961 --> 1:51:50.227
- Please don't...

1:51:51.570 --> 1:51:53.590
(Clara screams)

1:51:53.590 --> 1:51:54.424
(knife impales wood floor)

1:51:54.424 --> 1:51:55.257
(skull impacts against dresser)

1:51:55.257 --> 1:51:57.324
(body hits floor hard)

1:51:57.324 --> 1:52:02.282
(heartbeat pounding)

1:52:08.200 --> 1:52:09.385
(ominous music)

1:52:09.385 --> 1:52:14.318
(heartbeat pounding)

1:52:20.746 --> 1:52:23.136
(Clara sobs)

1:52:23.136 --> 1:52:26.149
(suspenseful music)

1:52:26.149 --> 1:52:29.857
(blood trickles down drain)

1:52:49.043 --> 1:52:50.418
(shower curtain slides open)

1:53:01.446 --> 1:53:03.387
(shower curtain slides open)

1:53:04.530 --> 1:53:06.138
(knocking on front door)

1:53:07.976 --> 1:53:10.409
(Clara weeps)

1:53:14.100 --> 1:53:15.400
(back door opens in distance)

1:53:18.204 --> 1:53:20.104
(pounding on glass on front door)

1:53:21.426 --> 1:53:24.876
(Clara gasps in pain)

1:53:27.850 --> 1:53:29.616
(Clara gasps in pain)

1:54:00.830 --> 1:54:03.330
(tense music)

1:54:05.771 --> 1:54:06.604
(Clara drags her injured leg)

1:54:09.042 --> 1:54:14.017
(music intensifies)

1:54:16.461 --> 1:54:17.567
(Clara screams)

1:54:17.567 --> 1:54:18.400
(stabbing sounds)

1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:19.476
(Clara screams)

1:54:19.476 --> 1:54:20.309
(rubber mask hits deck)

1:54:21.181 --> 1:54:22.790
(Mrs. Roberts coughs)

1:54:24.624 --> 1:54:25.457
- WHY?!

1:54:28.646 --> 1:54:30.912
(blood gurgling sounds)

1:54:32.501 --> 1:54:37.242
(Clara sobs)

1:54:47.204 --> 1:54:48.437
(pencil lands in blood)

1:54:49.417 --> 1:54:53.935
(gentle music plays)

1:54:53.935 --> 1:54:56.993
(police chatter from radios)

1:55:03.755 --> 1:55:05.430
- Okay, you're all set now.

1:55:05.430 --> 1:55:06.310
When you get to the hospital,

1:55:06.310 --> 1:55:08.340
you are gonna have to have stitches, okay?

1:55:08.340 --> 1:55:09.173
- Okay.

1:55:13.170 --> 1:55:14.203
- Here you go, sweetie.

1:55:18.900 --> 1:55:20.090
This is to help you, okay?

1:55:20.090 --> 1:55:20.923
Until you get to the hospital.

1:55:20.923 --> 1:55:23.229
They will
get you another.

1:55:23.229 --> 1:55:24.062
Alright?

1:55:24.062 --> 1:55:24.895
- Okay.

1:55:30.270 --> 1:55:32.280
Why are you here, Micah?

1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:36.550
- I found something in the
back of Mrs. Roberts' van...

1:55:36.550 --> 1:55:37.800
there were photos of you.

1:55:38.770 --> 1:55:40.323
I thought you should know about it.

1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:44.490
- Were you the one that
knocked on my door?

1:55:44.490 --> 1:55:47.530
- No, I was on your front
step and I rang the doorbell.

1:55:47.530 --> 1:55:50.880
And next thing I know there's
a pain in the back of my head,

1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:52.103
and I woke up in the bush.

1:55:53.129 --> 1:55:56.389
I would have never thought
Mrs. Roberts was...violent.

1:55:56.389 --> 1:56:00.353
(gentle music)

1:56:00.353 --> 1:56:04.136
(car pulls up and parks)

1:56:07.593 --> 1:56:09.960
(Mr. Banks runs across grass)

1:56:09.960 --> 1:56:11.262
(sirens blaring)

1:56:11.262 --> 1:56:16.261
(Clara begins sobbing)

1:56:17.519 --> 1:56:21.805
(gurney rattles as EMTs
bring out Mrs. Roberts)

1:56:21.805 --> 1:56:26.721
(gentle music)

1:56:35.500 --> 1:56:38.070
- [Reporter] For WGET, I'm Tim Chase.

1:56:38.070 --> 1:56:40.720
Authorities this morning are
investigating a horrific scene

1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:43.030
that occurred late last
night on Hallow Drive.

1:56:43.030 --> 1:56:44.750
An Eden police departments spokesperson

1:56:44.750 --> 1:56:46.940
said 18-year-old Clara
Banks of Eden, Tennessee

1:56:46.940 --> 1:56:49.910
was attacked by Betty
Roberts, 42, also of Eden.

1:56:49.910 --> 1:56:51.720
Ms. Banks suffered multiple stab wounds,

1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:53.220
but was able to fend off her attacker,

1:56:53.220 --> 1:56:54.980
which led to the death of Roberts.

1:56:54.980 --> 1:56:56.850
Betty Roberts had no prior arrest record

1:56:56.850 --> 1:56:57.990
nor history of violence,

1:56:57.990 --> 1:57:00.080
but sources tell us she
is now the prime suspect

1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:02.720
in two murders that occurred
earlier this week in Eden.

1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:03.930
In a related story,

1:57:03.930 --> 1:57:05.740
authorities are beginning
a search this morning

1:57:05.740 --> 1:57:06.870
for Kimmy Nichols.

1:57:06.870 --> 1:57:10.780
Nichols, 20 of Eden, went
missing the day before Halloween.

1:57:10.780 --> 1:57:12.630
Nichols is a close friend of
Clara Banks (faintly speaking)

1:57:12.630 --> 1:57:14.406
and attends Oak Ridge state college.

1:57:14.406 --> 1:57:18.225
(ominous music)

1:57:18.225 --> 1:57:22.683
(police radio chatter in background)

1:57:22.683 --> 1:57:25.260
- So tox screening analysis
of Mrs. Roberts revealed

1:57:25.260 --> 1:57:27.160
that she'd been given
the wrong medication...

1:57:28.660 --> 1:57:30.663
resulting in severe side effects.

1:57:31.660 --> 1:57:33.850
After looking at the deceased'
computer we found emails

1:57:33.850 --> 1:57:36.199
sent to your daughter's email address.

1:57:36.199 --> 1:57:38.590
It seems Mrs. Roberts had been
fixated on you for some time,

1:57:38.590 --> 1:57:40.750
probably the result of the medication.

1:57:40.750 --> 1:57:45.053
Side effects included paranoia,
hallucination, agitation...

1:57:45.053 --> 1:57:50.020
(ominous music)

1:57:54.935 --> 1:57:59.370
(upbeat music)

1:57:59.370 --> 1:58:02.467
- Do you have a date tonight?
- No, no, no...

1:58:02.467 --> 1:58:06.821
(upbeat music)

1:58:06.821 --> 1:58:10.210
(students chattering)

1:58:10.210 --> 1:58:12.802
- Maybe I do have a date.
- That's cute.

1:58:12.802 --> 1:58:13.728
- Yeah.

1:58:13.728 --> 1:58:18.686
(upbeat music)

1:58:23.028 --> 1:58:23.861
- Carmel...

1:58:31.497 --> 1:58:36.005
(ominous music)

1:58:38.812 --> 1:58:39.646
- You okay?

1:58:39.646 --> 1:58:40.487
- Mmm hmm...

1:58:40.487 --> 1:58:41.787
(Clara choking)

1:58:41.787 --> 1:58:43.065
Clara, what's wrong?

1:58:43.065 --> 1:58:43.966
(candy crashes to the floor)

1:58:43.966 --> 1:58:44.807
(Clara gasping)

1:58:44.807 --> 1:58:46.454
- Clara?!?
What's wrong?

1:58:46.454 --> 1:58:47.789
(Clara choking)

1:58:47.789 --> 1:58:49.510
Clara?

1:58:49.510 --> 1:58:51.496
Someone call 911 now!

1:58:51.496 --> 1:58:53.668
(Clara gasping)

1:58:53.668 --> 1:58:54.950
Oh my God...Clara!

1:58:54.950 --> 1:58:56.442
(Clara gasping for air)

1:58:56.442 --> 1:58:59.776
Somebody call an ambulance now!

1:58:59.776 --> 1:59:00.832
(Clara coughs)

1:59:00.832 --> 1:59:02.615
Call 911!!!

1:59:03.846 --> 1:59:04.971
Clara!

1:59:06.125 --> 1:59:11.017
(ominous music)

1:59:13.731 --> 1:59:15.398
Clara?!? Clara!
- Is she okay?

1:59:16.976 --> 1:59:17.893
- Call 911!

1:59:20.043 --> 1:59:20.876
Clara!

1:59:20.876 --> 1:59:23.529
- [Student] Oh my
goodness. What's happening?

1:59:23.529 --> 1:59:28.529
(gentle somber music begins)

1:59:52.528 --> 1:59:55.336
- Looks like angels. (laughs)

1:59:55.336 --> 2:00:00.069
- [Kimmy] Angels... (everyone laughs)

2:00:00.069 --> 2:00:01.229
- Hey hon, dinner's ready.

2:00:01.229 --> 2:00:03.354
(Jacob taps keyboard to hide screen)

2:00:03.354 --> 2:00:08.300
(gentle somber music continues)

2:00:11.174 --> 2:00:12.840
