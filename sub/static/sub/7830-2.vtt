Mr. Smithers, may we
offer you a ride to work?

01:08.234 --> 01:10.195
(chuckling)
No, thank you.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.739
(humming)

01:12.822 --> 01:14.574
We're from
Globex Corporation.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.326
We'd like to talk to you about

01:16.409 --> 01:18.161
an exciting employment
opportunity

01:18.244 --> 01:19.454
in our nuclear division.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.206
Flattered, but spoken for.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.333
We're prepared to offer you
an impressive salary

01:23.416 --> 01:26.336
plus health benefits for
you and your life partner.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.379
The answer is no.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.340
What's wrong with
this country?

01:30.423 --> 01:31.925
Can't a man walk
down the street

01:32.008 --> 01:34.302
without being
offered a job?

01:34.385 --> 01:36.387
(sighs)

01:36.471 --> 01:39.182
We'll have to go to the next
most senior man at the plant.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.725
Oh, here we are.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.185
Ten years' experience.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.436
His name is...

01:43.520 --> 01:44.896
Marge, I got a new job!

01:44.979 --> 01:46.815
It's with Globex Corporation.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.775
I get more money
plus health benefits

01:48.858 --> 01:50.568
for me and my life partner.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.445
And, they'll move us and give us
a nice house and liv--

01:52.529 --> 01:55.615
-Move us?
-It's in Cypress Creek, upstate somewhere.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.325
You took a new job
in a strange town

01:57.408 --> 01:59.202
without discussing it
with your family?

01:59.285 --> 02:00.662
Of course not.

02:00.745 --> 02:03.331
I wouldn't do that.
Why not?

02:03.414 --> 02:05.250
We have roots here, Homer.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.835
We have friends
and family

02:06.918 --> 02:08.670
and library cards.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.296
Bart's lawyer is here.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.216
But Marge,
this is a chance for me

02:13.299 --> 02:15.343
to fulfill
my lifelong dream.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.220
What lifelong dream?

02:17.303 --> 02:20.306
Promise not to laugh?

02:20.390 --> 02:23.560
I always wanted to own
the Dallas Cowboys.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.603
(laughing)

02:28.189 --> 02:29.315
I'm sorry, Dad.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.192
I just find that very cute.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.570
Homer, I don't want
to leave Springfield.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.905
I've dug myself into
a happy little rut here

02:35.989 --> 02:38.491
and I'm not about
to hoist myself out of it.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.243
Just bring the rut
with you, honey.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.744
Come on, take a look.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.004
Uh, let's watch
something else.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.339
Homer, you're trying to talk us
into moving to this place.

02:53.423 --> 02:56.009
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Let's watch this.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.261
WOMAN:
<i>Look at this place.</i>

02:58.344 --> 03:00.847
<i>Somebody ought to build</i>
<i>a town that works.</i>

03:00.930 --> 03:02.098
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Somebody did.</i>

03:12.525 --> 03:15.111
<i>It's called Cypress Creek--</i>

03:15.195 --> 03:17.947
<i>a planned community designed for</i>
<i>the workers of the Globex Corporation.</i>

03:18.031 --> 03:21.242
<i>Cypress Creek--</i>
<i>where dreams come true.</i>

03:21.326 --> 03:23.036
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Your dreams</i>
<i>may vary from those</i>

03:23.119 --> 03:25.747
<i>of Globex Corporation, its</i>
<i>subsidiaries and shareholders.</i>

03:25.830 --> 03:27.290
Well, what do you
think of me

03:27.373 --> 03:29.083
and Cypress Creek now, Marge?

03:29.167 --> 03:32.045
It does seem nicer
than Springfield.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.880
Yeah, did you notice how
the people weren't shoving

03:33.963 --> 03:35.632
or knocking
each other down?

03:35.715 --> 03:37.800
I've never been to a place
like that before.

03:37.884 --> 03:38.885
-(cries out)
-Me neither.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.931
Well, we could use
the extra money,

03:43.014 --> 03:46.184
and this house
is falling apart.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.518
All right.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.895
(cheering)

03:53.733 --> 03:55.735
Oh, wow! Windows.
(chuckles)

03:55.818 --> 03:58.154
I don't think I can
afford this place.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.739
(doorbell chimes)

03:59.822 --> 04:01.741
Hello. I am not interested
in buying the house,

04:01.824 --> 04:03.409
but I would like
to use your rest room,

04:03.493 --> 04:05.119
flip through your magazines,

04:05.203 --> 04:07.080
rearrange your carefully
shelved items,

04:07.163 --> 04:09.916
and handle your food products
in an unsanitary manner.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.877
Ha! Now you know
how it feels!

04:12.961 --> 04:14.587
Thank you. Come again.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.340
We'll never sell
this rotten dump.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.385
A little help here.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.178
Even if we sell the house,

04:22.262 --> 04:25.306
we still don't come close
to paying off the mortgage.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.184
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.818
Uh... Homer, ah...

04:36.901 --> 04:39.904
about those things you borrowed
from me over the years,

04:39.988 --> 04:42.240
you know, the TV trays,
the power sander,

04:42.323 --> 04:44.742
the downstairs bathtub,

04:44.826 --> 04:47.578
you going to be needing
those things in Cypress Creek?

04:47.662 --> 04:50.164
-Yes.
-Oh, uh...

04:50.248 --> 04:52.458
Okily dokily...

04:52.542 --> 04:54.210
Okily dokily.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.718
-(tires screech)
-Bye-diddly-I.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.678
-So long.
-God bless you.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.346
-See ya.
-Good-bye.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.682
-Bye-bye, Homer.
-Take care.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.267
-Adios.
-So long.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.476
Fare thee well.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.978
Arr. Bon voyage.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.187
Toodle-oo.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.188
So long.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.315
-Bye-bye.
-Ta-ta.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.400
-Bye, everybody.
-Bye-bye.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.319
-Sayonara, dudes.
-So long.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.612
-ALL: Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye, now.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.072
-Bye.
-See ya.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.115
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.658
Ha-ha.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.452
I'm gonna
miss Springfield.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.579
This town's been
awfully good to us.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.331
No, it hasn't, Dad.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.415
That's why
we're leaving.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.458
Oh, yeah.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.752
So long, stinktown!

05:48.389 --> 05:51.768
It says here, one of these
giant redwood trees

05:51.851 --> 05:54.312
can provide
enough sawdust to cover

05:54.395 --> 05:56.522
an entire day's worth
of vomit at Disneyland.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.858
ALL:
Ooh.

05:58.941 --> 06:02.987
Ahh.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.990
Ohh.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.326
Ooh.

06:08.409 --> 06:09.911
Here we are:

06:09.994 --> 06:12.830
15201 Maple Systems Road--

06:12.914 --> 06:15.291
Our new home.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.212
(whistles)

06:19.295 --> 06:21.255
I call this room.

06:23.299 --> 06:24.926
(knocking)

06:25.009 --> 06:26.677
I am here to welcome you

06:26.761 --> 06:29.305
on behalf of the President
of the Globex Corporation.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.891
Me. Try the papayas.

06:31.974 --> 06:32.975
They're juicy
and full of papayine.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.936
Makes you strong
like Popeye.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.021
Popeye, papayine.
Popeye, papayine.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.315
See? Same thing.
Same... Ah, forget it.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.775
How are you?
I'm Hank Scorpio.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.819
Wow, my boss.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.278
Don't call me that word.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.738
I don't like things
that elevate me

06:45.822 --> 06:47.407
above the other people.
I'm just like you.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.075
Oh, sure, I come
later in the day,

06:49.158 --> 06:51.244
I get paid a lot more
and I take longer vacations,

06:51.327 --> 06:53.162
but I don't like
the word "boss."

06:53.246 --> 06:54.163
-Hey, look at my feet.
-Okay.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.542
You like those moccasins? Look in
your closet. There's a pair for you.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.378
Don't like them? Then neither do I.
Get the hell out of here!

07:00.461 --> 07:01.921
Ha! Ever see a guy
say good-bye to a shoe?

07:02.588 --> 07:03.506
Yes, once.

07:03.589 --> 07:07.260
Mr. Scorpio, this house
is almost too good for us.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.804
I keep expecting
to get the bum's rush.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.056
We don't have bums in our town, Marge,
and if we did, they wouldn't rush.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.766
They'd be allowed to go
at their own pace.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.477
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of a fun run.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.229
See you at work tomorrow.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.356
Although I don't really like
to call it work.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.944
Whoa.

07:28.156 --> 07:31.909
Okay, the oven
is cleaning itself.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.745
The Autovac's on dirt patrol.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.248
(beeping, whirring)

07:37.331 --> 07:39.959
And Maggie's enjoying
her swing-a-majig.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.675
(whimpering)

07:47.758 --> 07:49.594
I can't believe it.

07:49.677 --> 07:52.930
I've done all my housework,
and it's only 9:30.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.141
Well, better go upstairs

07:55.224 --> 07:57.143
and make sure the beds
are still made.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.359
You will notice,
my new best friend,

08:05.443 --> 08:07.278
that we are pretty
casual around here.

08:07.361 --> 08:10.031
Yes, sir.
I will notice that.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.324
Very casual, Mr. Scorpion.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.326
Don't call me "Mr. Scorpion."

08:13.409 --> 08:15.119
It's "Mr. Scorpio,"
but don't call me that, either.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.497
Call me Hank.
Say, before we continue our tour,

08:17.580 --> 08:19.832
would you mind hanging my coat
up on the wall, please?

08:19.916 --> 08:23.252
Mm-hmm. Um, uh...
Let's see, um...

08:23.336 --> 08:25.838
-Well, uh...
-(laughing )

08:25.922 --> 08:27.465
Relax, Homer.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.258
At Globex,
we don't believe in walls.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.427
Matter of fact, I didn't even
give you my coat.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.555
Hmm?

08:34.639 --> 08:36.015
Wow.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.225
Having a place like this

08:37.308 --> 08:38.726
has always been
my dream, Homer.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.144
What's your dream?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.687
Uh, to work for you?

08:41.771 --> 08:43.272
Don't do that.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.649
My butt is for sitting,
not for kissing.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.359
Now you tell me the truth.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.152
What's your real dream?
Your <i>real</i> dream!

08:48.236 --> 08:52.907
Um, someday, I'd... like
to own the Dallas Cowboys.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.951
I bet people laughed at you
when you told 'em that dream.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.869
-Yeah.
-Homer, don't give up.

08:56.953 --> 09:00.289
They laughed at me the first time
I wore jeans with a sport coat.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.875
I was the first wealthy man
in America to ever do that.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.669
Now they <i>all</i> do it.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.796
-Did you ever hear of Mike Milken?
-Yeah-- No.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.090
-Hi there.
-Hey, how you doing?

09:09.173 --> 09:11.676
Now, Homer, these gentlemen here
will be your eyes and your ears,

09:11.759 --> 09:13.344
and should the need arise,
they'll fill in

09:13.427 --> 09:14.929
for any other
part of your body.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.390
Your job will be to manage
and motivate them.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.684
Give them the benefit of your
years of experience.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.477
Don't worry,
that won't take long.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.396
The key to
motivation is trust.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.856
Let me show you what I mean.
I want you to close your eyes

09:25.940 --> 09:27.567
and fall backwards,
and I'll catch you.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.694
That's gonna show you what
trust is all about. Ready?

09:29.777 --> 09:32.154
-Alright.
-Three, two...

09:32.238 --> 09:33.447
-(phone ringing )
-One second.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.574
-Hello?
-D-ohh!

09:34.657 --> 09:35.992
Oh, my God,
a guy's on the floor.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.076
That was a phone call.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.411
Don't chalk that up
to mistrust, now.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.329
Yes? What happened?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.540
When did that happen?
How much of it?

09:42.623 --> 09:44.417
Oh my goodness,
I'll be right up.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.793
Homer, I got to go upstairs.
There's a problem.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.795
Somebody ate part
of my lunch.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.005
I'm gonna leave
everything to you.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.298
We're on a
tight schedule.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.799
You keep them motivated.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.430
Are you guys working?

09:57.513 --> 09:59.348
Yes, sir, Mr. Simpson.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.435
Could you, um,
work any harder than this?

10:02.518 --> 10:04.979
Sure thing, boss.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.315
Hey, call me Homer.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.487
(making armpit noises)

10:18.034 --> 10:19.619
You got a fresh sound.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.912
It will play well
at this school.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.333
Hey Bart, do you have
a best friend yet?

10:25.416 --> 10:28.628
'Cause I've been looking
for someone to boss me around.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.005
Okay, folks,
let's do it to it.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.006
(chuckling)

10:32.089 --> 10:33.466
Grammar, that is.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.593
Uh, everybody write down
this sentence

10:35.676 --> 10:36.844
and circle the nouns.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.974
Bart, as the newest addition
to our menagerie,

10:42.058 --> 10:43.184
you have the honors.

10:43.267 --> 10:46.103
Um... uh...

10:46.187 --> 10:48.356
Well, let's start
by reading the sentence.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.775
"Two wintim

10:50.858 --> 10:55.196
amd jawwy wirt... "
(trails off)

10:56.822 --> 10:58.449
(armpit noise)

10:59.659 --> 11:03.204
So, you never
learned cursive?

11:03.287 --> 11:05.790
Um, well, I know "hell"
and "damn" and "bit--"

11:05.873 --> 11:07.541
Cursive handwriting, script.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.752
Do you know
the multiplication tables?

11:09.835 --> 11:10.836
Long division?

11:10.920 --> 11:13.589
-I know of them.
-Hmm...

11:13.673 --> 11:15.800
You know, Bart,
I think you'd profit

11:15.883 --> 11:18.469
from a more
remedial environment.

11:18.552 --> 11:21.847
And I'm sure you'll feel
right at home in...

11:21.931 --> 11:24.183
the Leg-Up Program.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.768
(gasps)

11:39.156 --> 11:41.242
(groans)

11:41.325 --> 11:43.160
Guess I can't complain.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.288
Everything's perfect here.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.546
(ominous music playing)

11:55.923 --> 11:57.967
So, what are you in for?

11:58.050 --> 12:03.139
I moved here from Canada,
and they think I'm slow, eh?

12:03.222 --> 12:04.640
I fell off the jungle gym,

12:04.724 --> 12:07.226
and when I woke up,
I was in here.

12:07.309 --> 12:10.438
I start fires.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.274
Okay, now, everyone
take out your safety pencil

12:13.357 --> 12:15.109
and a circle of paper.

12:15.192 --> 12:18.487
This week, I hope we can finish
our work on the letter "A."

12:18.571 --> 12:20.072
Let me get this straight.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.324
We're behind
the rest of our class,

12:22.408 --> 12:25.703
and we're going to catch up to them
by going slower than they are?

12:25.786 --> 12:27.079
Cuckoo.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.039
ALL: Cuckoo, cuckoo,
cuckoo, cuckoo...

12:29.123 --> 12:30.541
Stop it. Stop it!

12:30.624 --> 12:32.585
Warren! Melvin!
Gary! Dot! Gordy!

12:32.668 --> 12:35.421
Look, lady, I'm supposed
to be in the fourth grade.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.716
Sounds to me like someone's
got a case of "the s'pose'das."

12:38.799 --> 12:41.010
(groans)

12:44.180 --> 12:45.181
-(hard slap)
-Warren!

12:50.478 --> 12:52.730
Wild flowers!

12:52.813 --> 12:55.232
We don't have you
in Springfield.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.317
(chittering )

12:56.400 --> 12:58.235
Hello, Mr. Chipmunk.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.197
You're a northern
reticulated chipmunk.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.948
Yes, you are.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.117
You are so reticulated.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.411
Hi, Mrs. Owl.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.038
You're out kind of early.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.706
<i>♪ La-la-la, la-la... ♪</i>

13:10.790 --> 13:12.500
(hooting)

13:16.837 --> 13:19.548
Mr. Scorpio says productivity
is up two percent,

13:19.632 --> 13:22.885
and it's all because
of <i>my</i> motivational techniques,

13:22.968 --> 13:27.139
like doughnuts and the possibility
of more doughnuts to come.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.391
I knew you'd
do well, Homer.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.144
Sports collectibles.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.481
Wow, a baseball made
out of Secretariat.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.233
(gasping )

13:37.316 --> 13:40.569
Tom Landry's hat,
and it's autographed.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.321
"To Berman's Dry Cleaning.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.282
Best wishes, Tom Landry."

13:45.366 --> 13:47.117
Why don't you buy it?

13:47.201 --> 13:48.828
I can't buy that.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.163
Only management-type guys
with big salaries like me

13:51.247 --> 13:52.790
can afford things like that.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.708
(gasps)
Guys like me.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.252
I'm a guy like me.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.671
All right, team,
it's the fourth quarter.

13:58.754 --> 14:01.090
The Lord gave us the atoms,
and it's up to us

14:01.173 --> 14:04.093
to make them dance.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.804
Hey, if Tom Landry's hat
doesn't motivate you,

14:06.887 --> 14:09.348
then I should just
quit right now.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.267
I'm sorry, we're just
a little tired, sir.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.685
We've been pushing
ourselves real hard

14:12.768 --> 14:13.894
to get the reactor on-line.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.521
Tired, eh?

14:15.604 --> 14:19.024
What you guys need
is hammocks.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.239
Uh, hi, Homer.
What can I do for you?

14:25.322 --> 14:27.658
Sir, I need to know where can I get
some business hammocks?

14:27.741 --> 14:28.826
Hammocks?

14:28.909 --> 14:30.411
My goodness, what an idea.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.371
Why didn't I think of that?
Hammocks.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.456
Homer, there's
four places.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.375
-There's the Hammock Hut. That's on Third.
-Uh-huh.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.459
-There's Hammocks-R-US.
-Got it.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.669
That's on Third too.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.546
-You got Put-Your-Butt-There.
-Mm-hmm.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.047
-That's on Third.
-Yes.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.841
-Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.
-Right.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.384
Matter of fact, they're all
in the same complex.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.052
It's the Hammock Complex
down on Third.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.137
Oh, the Hammock District.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.430
That's right.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.390
Ready for the linkup,
Mr. Scorpio.

14:51.473 --> 14:52.808
Homer, one second.
I got to take care of this.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.643
Very important.
Be right back.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.728
Fine.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.274
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.567
This is Scorpio.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.027
I have the doomsday device.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.404
You have 72 hours
to deliver the gold,

15:05.487 --> 15:07.448
or you'll face
the consequences.

15:07.531 --> 15:10.409
And to prove I'm not
bluffing, watch this.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.954
(explosion)

15:14.038 --> 15:16.790
Oh, my God,
the 59th Street bridge.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.501
Maybe it just collapsed
on its own.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.086
We can't take that chance.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.421
You always say that.

15:22.504 --> 15:23.964
I want to take a chance.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.591
Collapsed on its own?

15:25.674 --> 15:27.551
You... You have 72 hours.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.304
See you. Back to
the hammocks, my friend.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.764
-Yes.
-You know there's a little place

15:31.847 --> 15:33.265
called
Mary Ann's Hammocks.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.850
The nice thing
about that place

15:34.934 --> 15:36.685
is Mary Ann gets in
the hammock with you.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.771
-(laughs) I'm just kidding.
-Oh.

15:38.854 --> 15:40.147
-You know who invented the hammock, Homer?
-No.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.441
That's something for you to do.
Find that out.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.659
Any sugar around here?

15:51.742 --> 15:53.285
Try in there, Homer.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.625
SCORPIO:
Hi, Homer.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.377
I'm keeping two
of my fingers crossed

16:01.460 --> 16:02.544
that you're going
to have that nuclear generator

16:02.628 --> 16:04.213
up to full power by tomorrow.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.798
Yes, sir. No problemo.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.800
Good. By the way, Homer.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.052
What's your least favorite country?
Italy or France?

16:10.135 --> 16:11.595
-France.
-(chuckling)

16:11.679 --> 16:13.889
Nobody ever says Italy.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.145
I never noticed
this office before.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.563
Why should you?
It's mine.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.232
Eh, you have any
sugar around here?

16:23.315 --> 16:24.566
Sugar? Sure.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.695
There you go.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.572
Sorry it's not in packages.
Want some cream?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.825
Uh... ye... no.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.586

17:42.102 --> 17:45.439
Ingenious,
isn't it, Mr. Bont?

17:45.522 --> 17:47.357
Scorpio, you're totally mad.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.735
Heh. I wouldn't
point fingers, you jerk.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.737
So, do you expect
me to talk?

17:51.820 --> 17:53.405
I don't expect anything
from you,

17:53.489 --> 17:55.407
except to die
and be a very cheap funeral.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.117
You're going to die now.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.037
(grunts)

18:08.504 --> 18:10.339
Stop him!
He's supposed to die!

18:13.550 --> 18:16.095
Nice work, Homer.
Am I proud of you.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.805
Well...

18:17.888 --> 18:19.473
When you go home tonight,
there's going to be

18:19.556 --> 18:21.308
another story
on your house.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.393
-Thank you.
-(guns firing)

18:23.477 --> 18:27.606
I tackled a loafer
at work today.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.317
Hey, what's with
you sad sacks?

18:30.400 --> 18:32.361
I'm allergic
to everything here.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.029
My nose is so stuffed up

18:34.113 --> 18:37.074
I can't even taste Mom's
delicious boiled celery.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.368
I've been so bored
since we moved here,

18:39.451 --> 18:41.954
I found myself drinking
a glass of wine every day.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.540
I know doctors say you should
drink a glass and a half,

18:44.623 --> 18:46.500
but I just can't
drink that much.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.545
Well, the Simpson men
are doing fine, right, Bart?

18:49.628 --> 18:51.797
You haven't even gotten
in trouble at school.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.674
I can't get in trouble
at school.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.717
They put me
in the remedial class.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.136
I'm surrounded by arsonists

18:57.219 --> 18:58.303
and kids with mittens
pinned to their jackets

18:58.387 --> 18:59.429
all year 'round.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.933
Hey, Dad...

19:03.016 --> 19:05.686
ALL: We want to go back
to Springfield.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.272
What? We've got it great here.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.232
And for the first time
in my life,

19:10.315 --> 19:12.526
I'm actually good
at my job.

19:12.609 --> 19:16.029
My team is way ahead of the weather
machine and germ warfare divisions.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.282
It's up to you, Homer.

19:18.365 --> 19:21.034
Whatever you decide,
that's what we'll do.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.786
(whimpers)

19:32.254 --> 19:35.465
WOMAN (on P.A.): <i>"T" minus</i>
<i>one minute, 35 seconds.</i>

19:46.435 --> 19:49.021
Uh... I've got
a problem, Hank.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.023
Oh, gee, Homer,
could it wait a sec, please?

19:51.106 --> 19:53.150
Well, it's pretty important.

19:53.233 --> 19:57.112
-(grunting)
-Say, what's going on?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.697
I'm having a little
trouble with the government.

19:58.780 --> 20:01.658
Oh, those jerks always walking
over the small businessman.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.244
Don't get me started
about the government.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.454
What's the problem?

20:05.537 --> 20:08.165
Well, my family wants to
move back to Springfield.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.584
Let them go. You'll stay here with me,
we'll go bowling.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.127
What's bothering them?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.463
Nothing big.
It's just a lot of little things.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.465
Well, you can't argue
with the little things.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.550
It's the little things
that make up life.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.929
Homer, I'm disappointed,

20:22.012 --> 20:23.931
but I think you need to do
what's best for your family.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.558
Well, thanks
for everything, Hank.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.936
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>"T" minus 14 seconds.</i>

20:29.019 --> 20:30.437
If you need
anything, you call me.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.730
Alright, what's the number?

20:31.813 --> 20:33.398
I've never had to call
my own company.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.443
Someone will tell you upstairs.
But Homer, on your way out,

20:36.526 --> 20:38.528
if you want to kill somebody,
it would help me a lot.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.662
(evil laughter )

20:48.580 --> 20:51.166
Hey, Homer,
you're missing out on some fun.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.189
Uh-oh. Sorry.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.484
Let me just get
my girlfriend, and I'll go.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.319
Hey, Crystal, wake up.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.029
(doorbell ringing)

21:21.113 --> 21:22.197
Telegram.

21:24.366 --> 21:28.203
"Project Arcturus couldn't
have succeeded without you.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.456
"This will get you a little
closer to that dream of yours.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.376
"It's not the Dallas Cowboys,
but it's a start.

21:34.459 --> 21:38.630
Drop me a line if you're on
the East Coast, Hank Scorpio."

21:40.841 --> 21:43.635
Ah, the Denver Broncos?

21:43.719 --> 21:46.513
I think owning the Denver
Broncos is pretty good.

21:46.596 --> 21:49.683
-Yeah, yeah.
-Well, explain to me why it isn't.

21:49.766 --> 21:53.353
(sighs) You just don't
understand football, Marge.
