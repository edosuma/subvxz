Oh, my!
This place is enormous!

00:40.165 --> 00:42.876
Aw, man, they got these
little plastic disc guns.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.087
I haven't seen one
since Cleveland's wedding.

00:45.170 --> 00:48.090
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

00:48.173 --> 00:50.968
to celebrate the joining of
these two young people...

00:51.051 --> 00:52.177
( Peter snickering )

00:52.261 --> 00:54.096
In the bonds
of holy matrimony...

00:54.179 --> 00:55.389
( snickering )

00:55.472 --> 00:57.474
consecrated
before God Almighty.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.559
( snickering )

00:58.642 --> 01:00.018
Hey, Stratego!

01:00.102 --> 01:01.603
I used to love this game.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.439
Oh, my God!
Abe Vigoda?

01:04.523 --> 01:05.816
Go bother Steve Guttenberg.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.068
He's behind
the Chinese checkers.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.194
Abe, shut up!

01:11.154 --> 01:14.950
( keyboard playing melody )

01:15.033 --> 01:16.159
Hey, look at me, Chris.

01:16.243 --> 01:20.205
I'm Yanni,
sans the attitude.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.249
My God, that's amazing!

01:22.332 --> 01:24.251
You are so talented!

01:24.334 --> 01:25.460
Huh?

01:25.544 --> 01:26.795
Wait a second.

01:26.879 --> 01:27.921
Something's not
right here.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.256
( music stops )

01:29.339 --> 01:31.300
You were just making it
look like you were playing.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.759
You're a phony!

01:32.843 --> 01:35.679
Hey! This guy's
a great big phony!

01:35.762 --> 01:37.097
Come on, Chris.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.433
( timer clicking )

01:39.516 --> 01:40.642
( surprised gasp )

01:40.726 --> 01:41.894
Oh, there you are, Stewie.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.479
Hey, you're a great big phony,
you know that?

01:44.563 --> 01:46.732
Come on, Stewie. Your mom
and I have something for you.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.400
Oh, let me guess.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.777
You've picked out yet another
colorful box with a crank

01:50.861 --> 01:52.237
that I'm expected to turn
and turn

01:52.321 --> 01:54.364
until, ooh, big shocker:
a Jack pops out.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.700
And you laugh, and the kids
laugh, and the dog laughs

01:56.783 --> 01:57.826
and I die a little inside.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.997
-( gasps )
-LOIS: Surprise, honey.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.290
A trikey!

02:04.583 --> 02:06.084
I think he likes it.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.837
When I stick this Army guy
with the sharp bayonet

02:08.921 --> 02:10.464
up my nose,
it tickles my brain.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.590
( laughing )

02:11.673 --> 02:15.052
Ow! Oh... now I don't know math.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.721
Give it to me!

02:17.804 --> 02:18.847
Give it to me now, damn it!

02:18.931 --> 02:20.641
Not now, Stewie.
When we get home.

02:20.724 --> 02:24.937
That's right.
You're a big fat phony!

02:26.855 --> 02:28.398
What I'm about to show you

02:28.482 --> 02:31.276
is a fight scene from Star Trek,
season one, episode 18.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.154
And, as a bonus, I'm going
to identify when it's Shatner

02:34.238 --> 02:36.281
and when it's his stunt double,
Fred Lubins.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.033
Let's watch.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.159
That's Shatner, of course.

02:39.243 --> 02:40.452
That's Lubins.

02:40.536 --> 02:42.246
That's Shatner.
That's Lubins.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.330
That's Shatner.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.665
That's Lubins.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.416
Now that's Shatner,
but when I freeze-frame

02:46.500 --> 02:48.293
you can clearly see Lubins'
coffee cup

02:48.377 --> 02:49.419
sitting on that rock!

02:49.503 --> 02:51.129
He is the biggest dork
on the planet!

02:51.213 --> 02:52.840
Oh, totally.

02:52.923 --> 02:57.386
And so, because of his rough-
and-tumble style of command

02:57.469 --> 03:01.598
Captain Kirk is clearly superior
to Jean-Luc Picard.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.225
Any questions... Meg?

03:03.308 --> 03:05.018
No. Leave me alone!

03:05.102 --> 03:06.478
Thank you, Neil,
for that incredibly

03:06.562 --> 03:07.938
irrelevant presentation.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.023
We all know Captain Picard
is the superior officer.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.155
Ugh!

03:17.239 --> 03:18.365
Hey, everybody!

03:18.448 --> 03:20.117
Mr. Lazenby's getting arrested!

03:23.579 --> 03:25.664
Well, what, in God's name...

03:25.747 --> 03:27.916
Mr. Lazenby, what the hell's
going on here?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.418
Apparently there's some law

03:29.501 --> 03:31.461
against teaching
the evolutionary theory

03:31.545 --> 03:33.422
that Gil Gerard used
a time machine

03:33.505 --> 03:35.716
went back, and ejaculated
into the primordial ooze.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.093
This stupid country.

03:38.177 --> 03:39.720
Hello, Tom Tucker live

03:39.803 --> 03:40.971
at James Woods High School

03:41.054 --> 03:42.973
with this sensational
breaking story:

03:43.056 --> 03:45.017
a teacher caught
molesting children...

03:45.100 --> 03:46.351
with crackpot theories.

03:46.435 --> 03:47.477
Full story at 11:00.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.604
TOM'S ASSISTANT:
And out.

03:48.687 --> 03:49.855
Oh, my God!

03:49.938 --> 03:51.857
That's Tom Tucker
from the news!

03:51.940 --> 03:54.359
Hey, kids, remember,
Mr. T says

03:54.443 --> 03:57.070
"I pity the fool
who does drugs."

04:05.954 --> 04:06.955
Better hurry up, Mr. Tucker.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.249
I'm coming.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.888
And reports indicate
she has also consumed

04:22.971 --> 04:24.306
a record amount
of seamen.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.266
Well, that sounds like one
powerful hurricane, Diane.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.392
In other news

04:27.476 --> 04:29.811
school board elections
took place last evening

04:29.895 --> 04:31.396
and with six precincts reporting

04:31.480 --> 04:33.774
candidate Fred Johnson leads
candidate Betsy Lebow

04:33.857 --> 04:35.817
by a substantial margin.

04:35.901 --> 04:40.697
( "Moving in Stereo" playing)

04:44.785 --> 04:46.161
Hi, Meg.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.121
You know how cute
I think you are.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.959
( music playing )

05:12.145 --> 05:14.022
Whoa!

05:14.106 --> 05:15.315
Yikes.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.525
Awkward.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.322
Hey, you know who lives
in this house?

05:22.406 --> 05:24.324
A great big phony!

05:24.408 --> 05:25.784
That's right!

05:25.868 --> 05:27.244
A phony lives here!

05:27.327 --> 05:29.413
A big fat phony!

05:32.624 --> 05:34.084
I say, look at me.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.211
I feel
like a regular grease monkey.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.297
Hey, remember that time
I had that Mustang?

05:38.380 --> 05:39.882
Oh, yeah, you took it
for a spin that time.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.091
( laughs )

05:41.175 --> 05:42.759
Yeah, that was awesome!

05:42.843 --> 05:45.637
Then those chowder-heads on the
corner, they busted your stones.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.389
( both laughing )

05:47.472 --> 05:49.099
Hey, your sister say
anything about me?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.603
Oh, my God! I'm
missing the news!

05:52.686 --> 05:54.062
We all miss The News, Meg

05:54.146 --> 05:56.106
but Huey Lewis needs time
to create

05:56.190 --> 05:57.941
and we have to learn
to be patient.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.443
And, in entertainment

05:59.526 --> 06:01.278
Mary Tyler Moore is
64-years-old today.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.362
Really? 64?

06:02.446 --> 06:03.655
Yes.

06:03.739 --> 06:04.865
Now, I thought she was dead.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.074
Nope. She's alive.

06:06.158 --> 06:08.202
Fantastic.
And now this.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.287
Are you an area high
school student interested

06:10.370 --> 06:12.539
in the glamorous world
of unpaid internships?

06:12.623 --> 06:14.208
If so, we'd like to invite you

06:14.291 --> 06:16.543
to try out for Channel Five's
Young Anchor Program.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.003
Oh, wow!

06:18.086 --> 06:19.713
You'll gain valuable experience

06:19.796 --> 06:21.882
have a chance to work closely
with Tom and me

06:21.965 --> 06:24.092
and, best of all,
produce your own on-air report.

06:24.176 --> 06:25.344
So call us now.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.512
BOTH:
Yeah!

06:38.148 --> 06:39.900
All right, question #1:

06:39.983 --> 06:41.568
Would you consider
growing a mustache?

06:41.652 --> 06:43.111
I guess so.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.238
Question #2:

06:44.321 --> 06:45.739
Look at my mustache.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.699
Do you think it tickles women
when I kiss them?

06:47.783 --> 06:49.535
I... I don't know.

06:49.618 --> 06:50.953
Wrong.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.412
The answer is:
"Only slightly. Only slightly."

06:52.496 --> 06:53.914
Next.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.708
Oh, God, I can't hire

06:56.792 --> 06:57.876
any of these girls.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.336
They're all too pretty.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.672
Their breasts are too perky.

07:02.673 --> 07:03.841
( gasps ):
Perfect!

07:03.924 --> 07:05.676
Congratulations!
You got the job.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.135
Oh, my God!

07:07.219 --> 07:09.012
Oh, oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.139
This is beyond anything
I've ever dreamed of!

07:11.223 --> 07:12.474
You and your
partner will start

07:12.558 --> 07:14.226
first thing tomorrow
after school.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.520
-Great! Who's my partner?
-Hey, there, hot stuff.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.195
Well, well.

07:25.279 --> 07:28.448
It appears the fates have conspired
in our favor, eh, Meg?

07:28.532 --> 07:29.992
Look, stay away from me, Neil.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.577
Just because
we're working together

07:31.660 --> 07:33.036
does not mean
I have to like you.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.246
Give it to me!

07:34.329 --> 07:35.455
What's that?

07:35.539 --> 07:36.748
Give it to me, Neil!

07:36.832 --> 07:37.833
MEG ( on tape ):
Give it to me!

07:37.916 --> 07:38.959
Give it to me, Neil!

07:39.042 --> 07:41.837
Yeah, that'll work just fine.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.088
Ugh!

07:43.172 --> 07:44.590
Hey, look who's here, Diane.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.466
It's our bright-eyed
young interns.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.302
Did you two remember
to wear your eager caps?

07:48.385 --> 07:50.053
I sure did, Mr. Tucker.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.848
Great! 'Cause you two are going
to have so much fun.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.224
Don't act any cheerier, Diane.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.809
You'll give us all diabetes.

07:55.893 --> 07:56.977
Bite me, Tom.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.187
Come on, kids.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.272
And here's where we produce

08:00.355 --> 08:02.065
our in-studio
celebrity interviews.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.067
I just did one
with Dustin Hoffman.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.278
He's almost impossible to book,
but we got him.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.030
So, Dustin, it's been a while.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.489
I got to say, you look great.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.325
Are you trying to seduce me,
Mr. Tucker?

08:11.408 --> 08:12.451
I am not trying

08:12.534 --> 08:14.661
to seduce you, Dustin Hoffman.

08:14.745 --> 08:15.871
You really look great.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.623
Uh-oh. 12 minutes to Wapner.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.666
Yes, I understand
your hectic schedule.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.044
Well, Dustin, we really
appreciate you taking the time

08:22.127 --> 08:23.295
to be with us here
in the studio.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.005
If there's anything
I can ever do for you.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.216
Bring me Peter Pan!

08:27.299 --> 08:28.967
I'll keep my eye out for him.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.219
Thanks, Dustin.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.012
He's this tall.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.848
Uh, can you
believe it?

08:34.932 --> 08:37.351
Our little Stewie learning to ride
his first tricycle.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.478
Yeah, this is going to be even
more exciting

08:39.561 --> 08:41.522
than when Brian taught me
about Christopher Columbus.

08:41.605 --> 08:42.773
Where are we
going, Brian?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.358
Peter, we're going
to visit the year 1492.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.692
That's when Columbus set sail

08:45.776 --> 08:47.152
on his famous voyage
to the New World.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.695
We're on a ship.
That's right.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.280
The Santa Maria--
one of three ships

08:50.364 --> 08:52.115
Columbus took
to find a direct route to India.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.534
Any sign of India yet, fellas?

08:53.617 --> 08:54.993
Nothing yet, Captain.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.745
India! But I thought
Columbus was going to America!

08:56.828 --> 08:58.121
On the contrary, Peter.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.456
Columbus discovered America
entirely by mistake!

08:59.540 --> 09:00.666
Wow!

09:00.749 --> 09:02.793
What the deuce do you
think you're doing?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.002
Back off, fat man.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.254
Hang on, Stewie.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.880
What the...?
Hey, hey, let go!

09:06.964 --> 09:08.423
Get your filthy
paws off.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.425
Let go! Let go,
I say! Let go!

09:10.509 --> 09:11.593
Don't let go!

09:11.677 --> 09:14.179
Oh, this is exhilarating!

09:14.263 --> 09:15.389
Go, Stewie!

09:15.472 --> 09:17.057
Yay, Stewie!

09:17.140 --> 09:18.433
Here. I got to go check
on dinner.

09:18.517 --> 09:19.810
You keep taping Stewie.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.894
Don't miss a moment.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.271
PETER:
I got it.

09:22.354 --> 09:26.650
Oh, look...
it's dancing with me.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.695
It's like there's this
incredibly benevolent force

09:29.778 --> 09:32.739
that wants me to know
there's no reason to be afraid.

09:32.823 --> 09:35.450
Sometimes there's so much beauty
in the world

09:35.534 --> 09:37.160
it makes my heart burst.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.496
It's just some trash blowing
in the wind!

09:39.580 --> 09:40.873
Do you have any idea

09:40.956 --> 09:43.250
how complicated
your circulatory system is?

09:44.960 --> 09:46.336
Hi, Mr. Tucker.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.005
I brought you
some Rice Krispies treats

09:48.088 --> 09:50.257
'cause I remember you saying you liked
them once on the news.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.843
See, look, this one--
it's in a the shape of a heart.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.012
I'm sorry, but there's
a handsome man in my spoon.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.221
You'll have to come back later.

09:57.931 --> 09:58.974
( gasps )

09:59.057 --> 10:00.601
Oh, my God!

10:00.684 --> 10:02.477
Meg's in love with Tom Tucker!

10:04.229 --> 10:07.316
Try to move in on my woman,
will you, Tom Tucker?

10:07.399 --> 10:08.859
Well, no one crosses
Neil Goldman

10:08.942 --> 10:10.068
and gets away with it.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.445
( cackling )

10:11.528 --> 10:13.071
I added a little something
to your coffee

10:13.155 --> 10:14.865
that I don't think
you're gonna like.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.034
Here's your coffee, Mr. Tucker.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.911
What the hell
is in this?

10:18.994 --> 10:20.454
Sweet 'N Low!

10:20.537 --> 10:22.164
That's for trying
to steal my woman!

10:22.247 --> 10:24.124
Go back and bring it to me with urine
in it like I asked!

10:24.208 --> 10:25.334
Yes, sir.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.714
Nice bike.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.758
Oh, if that's not the understatement
of the century.

10:32.841 --> 10:33.842
It's cool.

10:33.926 --> 10:35.052
Too cool for you.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.261
Oh, no, no.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.721
No, no, I think it's
right where I'm at.

10:37.804 --> 10:38.847
Out of my way!

10:38.931 --> 10:40.224
Oh, well, I see.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.142
Yes, yes, I suppose
you do have to ride it

10:42.226 --> 10:44.144
to truly appreciate
its virtues.

10:44.228 --> 10:46.772
Well, then, I'll just wait
right here till you get back.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.233
( sighs )

10:49.316 --> 10:50.817
Where the devil is he?

10:50.901 --> 10:52.486
You've obviously never met
a bully.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.029
What the deuce do you mean,
"bully"?

10:54.112 --> 10:56.406
He wasn't taking it
for a test ride. He was just taking it.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.617
( gasps )
You... you mean...?

10:58.700 --> 10:59.910
Mm-hmm.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.789
He... stole... my... tri... key?

11:03.872 --> 11:08.210
( wailing )

11:09.711 --> 11:10.838
MEG:
You know, Mr. Tucker

11:10.921 --> 11:12.214
has anyone
ever told you

11:12.297 --> 11:13.465
your eyes are...?
Hang on, sweetie.

11:13.549 --> 11:14.883
I've got to call Peter Jennings

11:14.967 --> 11:16.176
and reschedule our golf game.

11:16.260 --> 11:19.221
( ringing )

11:19.304 --> 11:22.266
( Hendrix guitar intro playing)

11:28.397 --> 11:30.315
PETER JENNINGS:
This is Peter.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.900
You know what to do.
( beep )

11:31.984 --> 11:33.610
Mr. Tucker, Ms. Simmons!

11:33.694 --> 11:35.904
There's some nut on top of city
hall with a high-powered rifle!

11:36.905 --> 11:38.198
The gunman has been identified

11:38.282 --> 11:39.533
as the notorious
mass-media murderer

11:39.616 --> 11:40.742
who targets members
of the press.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.035
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:42.119 --> 11:43.996
Mass media murderer?

11:44.079 --> 11:46.540
You know, I think
this would be a fine opportunity

11:46.623 --> 11:49.126
to give our interns
some real world experience.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.544
Hey, that means
you'll get to ride

11:50.627 --> 11:51.837
in the Action 5
News Chopper.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.338
I'm so jealous!

11:53.422 --> 11:54.423
Better put in for
some new interns.

11:54.506 --> 11:55.632
Good luck.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.385
I've got Hugh Downs up here

11:58.468 --> 12:01.096
and I'm going to splatter
his distinguished career

12:01.180 --> 12:02.472
all over the pavement.

12:02.556 --> 12:03.932
Hey, why me?
Why the media?

12:04.016 --> 12:05.309
I got my reasons.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.352
Dan Rather thinks
he can just condense

12:07.436 --> 12:09.813
a whole day's worth
of events into a half hour.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.691
Oh, don't get me
started on Rather that arrogant jerk.

12:12.774 --> 12:13.859
Really? You know him?

12:13.942 --> 12:17.112
I'm Hugh Downs. I know everybody.
In fact, he's right down there.

12:17.196 --> 12:18.572
Where?

12:18.655 --> 12:19.740
Ha-ha!

12:19.823 --> 12:21.158
See you later, sucker!

12:21.241 --> 12:23.410
And, by the way, Rather is
an okay guy in small doses.

12:25.871 --> 12:27.623
Look how close
we're getting, Meg.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.168
Hey, that was my
lucky assassin hat!

12:31.251 --> 12:32.336
( gunfire )

12:33.670 --> 12:35.631
Mayday! Mayday!
I'm going down!

12:40.886 --> 12:42.429
Oh, my God.
We're going to die!

12:42.513 --> 12:45.182
There's so much of life
I haven't experienced.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.558
I never even
got the chance

12:46.642 --> 12:49.102
to be some drunk
college guy's last resort.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.979
My years of expensive
orthodontic work

12:51.063 --> 12:52.356
will be a total waste!

12:52.439 --> 12:54.900
I never even had my first kiss!

12:54.983 --> 12:57.194
It's not too late, Meg.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.282
I'm here for you.

13:05.536 --> 13:07.412
Time to sign off.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.748
Remember me

13:09.831 --> 13:10.999
dirtbag?

13:13.961 --> 13:15.254
( clanking )

13:31.061 --> 13:32.187
( gun cocks )

13:35.274 --> 13:38.235
Wow, you saved those
kids' lives, Mr. Downs.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.361
All in a day's work.

13:39.444 --> 13:40.904
Remember, if you
ever need me

13:40.988 --> 13:42.155
just blow this whistle.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.949
Or call John Stossel's
cell phone.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.701
Hugh Downs away!

13:48.328 --> 13:50.247
Oh, honey, thank God
you're safe.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.373
We were so worried.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.792
We now go to Junior
Anchor Neil Goldman

13:53.876 --> 13:55.252
with exclusive
Channel 5 footage

13:55.335 --> 13:56.879
from today's
exciting scene.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.839
Thank you, Diane.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.008
There may have been some sort
of commotion on the rooftop

14:01.091 --> 14:02.676
but the real story

14:02.759 --> 14:06.722
was inside the mouths
of Meg Griffin and Neil Goldman

14:06.805 --> 14:10.017
where a meeting of the tongues,
a summit of saliva

14:10.100 --> 14:13.812
established
a new world order of love.

14:13.896 --> 14:14.980
( screams )

14:17.566 --> 14:20.068
Let's watch it one more time
in super slo-mo.

14:20.152 --> 14:23.488
This is where we
cease to be Meg and Neil

14:23.572 --> 14:26.700
and begin life anew as Meil.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.744
Oh, my God, he put it on TV.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.704
Oh, isn't
that cute, Peter?

14:30.787 --> 14:32.206
Our daughter's
first love.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.874
I just want to kill myself!

14:33.957 --> 14:36.793
I'm going upstairs right now
and eat a whole bowl of peanuts.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.922
I'm allergic to peanuts.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.883
You don't know anything
about me!

14:44.927 --> 14:45.928
Who was that guy?

14:47.471 --> 14:48.555
I say, Constable

14:48.639 --> 14:49.765
I'd like to report

14:49.848 --> 14:50.974
the theft of my tricycle.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.101
Oh, look at the little baby.

14:53.185 --> 14:54.561
Aren't you cute?

14:54.645 --> 14:56.438
Where's your mommy?

14:56.522 --> 14:58.315
How dare you
condescend to me?

14:58.398 --> 14:59.733
I demand justice!

14:59.816 --> 15:01.318
I'm here to turn
myself in.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.986
I have a dismembered
Baltic hooker

15:03.070 --> 15:04.780
bleeding through
the tarp in my trunk.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.532
Oh, look at
the little baby.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.158
Aren't you cute?

15:08.242 --> 15:09.826
Where's your mommy?

15:09.910 --> 15:11.036
( groans )

15:12.955 --> 15:14.873
( snickering )

15:21.213 --> 15:22.339
Where did you
get that shirt?

15:22.422 --> 15:23.590
Neil's giving them out.

15:23.674 --> 15:25.133
Hello, lover.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.927
Neil, what are you doing?

15:27.010 --> 15:28.262
I'm not your lover.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.429
I don't even like you.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.807
Meg, I strongly suggest
you hold my hand

15:31.890 --> 15:33.600
lest you look like a slut.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.102
Listen, you freak!

15:35.185 --> 15:37.521
Tell these people that there's nothing
going on between us.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.022
Oh, don't be afraid
of the fire, Meg.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.525
I won't let you burn.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.860
( groans )

15:42.943 --> 15:44.903
Al, why haven't
I leaped?

15:44.987 --> 15:46.864
Uh, Ziggy says
you can't leap

15:46.947 --> 15:48.156
until she loves you back.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.324
Don't worry.
I'll get her.

15:51.660 --> 15:52.953
So what were you
wanting to work on?

15:53.036 --> 15:54.079
Cardio, upper body, what?

15:54.162 --> 15:55.622
Upper body, definitely.

15:55.706 --> 15:57.624
I-I need to get buff
so I can get my tricycle back.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.626
Well, luckily we're running
a special right now

15:59.710 --> 16:00.836
for the next 17 minutes.

16:00.919 --> 16:03.422
Uh, okay, well, that's,
that's a little unusual

16:03.505 --> 16:04.798
but, uh, okay, well, tell me.

16:04.882 --> 16:06.133
Okay, well, the normal plan

16:06.216 --> 16:08.385
is 78 months at 40 a month
and 200 down.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.095
Watch this, forget the down,
are you watching?

16:10.179 --> 16:12.556
-Uh...
-Good-bye 40 a month, let's do 35.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.766
Okay, 35, all right, now, now,
that's the cheapest?

16:14.850 --> 16:16.185
Yeah, hang on, hang on.

16:16.268 --> 16:18.187
Trace, can you bring me
some of those free gym bags?

16:18.312 --> 16:19.563
-Thanks.
-Gosh, you know, I-I, you know

16:19.646 --> 16:21.565
I could probably just
do push ups at home.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.817
Well, let's start you
off with the complete body fat test

16:23.984 --> 16:25.903
-maybe a heart rate...
-You're actually not hearing me.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.196
I don't think
this is for me.

16:27.279 --> 16:28.363
Um, thanks anyway

16:28.447 --> 16:30.282
and, uh, for the future...

16:30.365 --> 16:32.326
( whispering ):
you came on a little strong.

16:36.371 --> 16:37.831
What's going on here?

16:37.915 --> 16:40.250
Oh, we invited Neil's
family over for dinner.

16:40.334 --> 16:41.460
Hi.
Hello.

16:41.543 --> 16:42.753
You what?!

16:42.836 --> 16:44.505
Yeah, we wanted to get
to know them better.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.256
Seeing as how the two
of you will one day

16:46.340 --> 16:47.883
bless our home with
the pitter-patter

16:47.966 --> 16:49.718
of sweet little grandchildren
as ugly as sin.

16:49.801 --> 16:50.969
Meg, you never told me

16:51.053 --> 16:53.055
your mother was such
a stone-cold fox.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.306
Now I see where
you get it.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.599
( chuckles )

16:55.682 --> 16:56.725
Meg, he's so charming.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.019
My name is Chris.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.438
I'm supposed to be on
my best behavior tonight

17:01.522 --> 17:03.482
and not mention pooh.

17:03.565 --> 17:06.193
Oh, God,
what have I done?!

17:06.276 --> 17:07.528
Well...

17:07.611 --> 17:08.779
let's eat.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.739
I think it's very, very nice

17:10.822 --> 17:13.158
that our children
had this wonderful kiss.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.827
I remember when Muriel
and I had our first kiss

17:15.911 --> 17:17.496
and it was just awful.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.373
Oh, just awful.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.958
We were both very sick.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.292
Weren't we, dear?

17:22.376 --> 17:24.545
Oh, we were
terribly sick.

17:24.628 --> 17:27.005
We were both 14,
and it was winter

17:27.089 --> 17:29.424
and we had terrible
head colds.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.844
Yes, mine especially
was very bad.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.847
I had terrible mucus coming
out from inside my nose

17:34.930 --> 17:36.139
and the other children

17:36.223 --> 17:38.058
they were very nasty to me
about that.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.143
They said bad,
hurtful things to me.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.271
They called me Tasty-Cakes

17:42.354 --> 17:45.983
and they would beat me
and stick pine cones in my ass.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.068
Those were very bad times.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.070
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.655
Thank you very much.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.906
Excuse me.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.366
I'm going to go throw up.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.077
Ah, please flush
the toilet twice.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.288
Once for the bulk and
again for the remainder.

17:59.371 --> 18:00.539
Thank you.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.748
Oh, she's a dear.

18:01.832 --> 18:03.584
( chuckling )

18:05.294 --> 18:07.504
Hey, you're blocking my light,
you stupid baby.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.173
You know, my hooligan friend

18:09.256 --> 18:11.967
I've been racking my brain
in a thus far fruitless attempt

18:12.050 --> 18:13.468
to resolve our recent
unpleasantness.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.429
Then it dawned on me.

18:15.512 --> 18:19.016
Your cruelty merely stems from
some deep-seated inner pain.

18:19.099 --> 18:22.102
So the obvious remedy is
a healthy dose of outer pain!

18:25.981 --> 18:28.901
Schoolchildren washing cars
to raise money for charity.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.402
Is there anything
more arousing?

18:30.485 --> 18:33.155
Finally, we go to Meg Griffin
for a special Channel Five

18:33.238 --> 18:35.949
Junior Anchor segment
on the moon. Meg?

18:36.033 --> 18:37.409
MEG:
The moon.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.453
There's a reason
no one goes there.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.788
It's cold.
And it's ugly.

18:41.872 --> 18:44.750
And its surface is plagued with
deep craters and jagged peaks.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.543
( gasps ):
Oh, wait.

18:46.627 --> 18:47.711
That's not the moon.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.255
It's Neil Goldman's face.

18:50.339 --> 18:53.717
Recently, many of you saw me
kissing this freak of nature.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.928
But if I didn't think I was
seconds away from death

18:56.011 --> 18:57.262
I would've never done it.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.014
I mean, who in their
right mind would?

18:59.097 --> 19:01.767
Well, I went to the streets
to find out.

19:01.850 --> 19:02.976
Would you kiss this guy?

19:03.060 --> 19:04.144
Ugh, no.

19:04.228 --> 19:05.354
No way.

19:05.437 --> 19:06.563
No.
No.

19:06.647 --> 19:07.689
No.
No.

19:07.773 --> 19:08.899
Ugh! God, no.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.400
What's the matter with you? Oh!

19:10.484 --> 19:12.986
It's official:
Neil Goldman is unkissable.

19:13.070 --> 19:14.196
Hear that, Neil?

19:14.279 --> 19:15.572
I don't like you
and I never will!

19:15.656 --> 19:16.865
Back to you, Tom.

19:16.949 --> 19:17.950
Thank you, Meg.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.451
I guess beggars
can be choosers.

19:19.535 --> 19:20.744
And now this.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.749
Well, well, isn't this
a darling picture?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.918
Let me go, man.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.419
Tell me, how old are you,
Charlie?

19:29.503 --> 19:31.255
Seven.
Seven?

19:31.338 --> 19:33.841
Well, my, my,
you're practically a lady.

19:33.924 --> 19:36.468
Ironic that your fate is
in the hands of an infant.

19:36.552 --> 19:38.220
Now tell me where
my tricycle is!

19:38.303 --> 19:39.304
I don't know.

19:39.388 --> 19:40.472
I lost it.

19:40.556 --> 19:42.015
Ow!

19:42.099 --> 19:44.518
Very well, I have other ways
of obtaining the truth.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.355
( crying ):
No! Don't!

19:48.438 --> 19:49.606
Stewie...

19:49.690 --> 19:50.774
look what I found.

19:50.858 --> 19:52.609
My trikey!

19:52.693 --> 19:54.611
What's going on
down here?

19:54.695 --> 19:56.321
Oh, we're playing house.

19:56.405 --> 19:58.448
That boy is all tied up.

19:58.532 --> 20:01.368
Roman Polanski's house.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.204
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

20:04.288 --> 20:06.248
Our top story,
the President has been shot.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.916
( clears throat )

20:08.000 --> 20:11.044
Tragedy strikes the nation.
The President has been shot.

20:11.128 --> 20:12.838
What's the President doing
in this casket?

20:12.921 --> 20:14.214
We'll tell you right after this.

20:14.298 --> 20:16.383
Hey, Meg, nice job on
that report last night.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.302
Wow, thanks,
Mr. Tucker.

20:18.385 --> 20:21.430
That means so much coming from
someone as handsome as yourself.

20:21.513 --> 20:23.432
Say, how'd you like to pick up
a handsome man's dry cleaning?

20:23.515 --> 20:25.350
Well, sure.

20:25.434 --> 20:26.852
But isn't that Neil's job?

20:26.935 --> 20:28.604
Little jerk hasn't
been in all day.

20:28.687 --> 20:29.730
He hasn't?

20:29.813 --> 20:31.023
We've got a breaking story!

20:31.106 --> 20:32.691
There's some geek
on top of town hall

20:32.774 --> 20:33.859
and he's about to jump.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.778
Oh, my God! Neil!

20:36.862 --> 20:38.238
Is it Neil?

20:38.322 --> 20:40.032
Huh, I've been calling
him Ned all week.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.827
Oh, my God.
Neil, please don't jump.

20:43.911 --> 20:46.246
I was just a piece of eye candy

20:46.330 --> 20:48.832
that she turned
into an all-day sucker.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.295
( gasps )

20:53.378 --> 20:54.379
Mr. Tucker!

20:54.463 --> 20:55.672
Thank God you're here.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.049
Someone's got
to do something.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.550
He's going to fall!
I'm on it, Meg.

20:58.634 --> 21:00.511
Hey, have that cartoon
sound effect guy

21:00.594 --> 21:03.305
cue up the
( falling bomb whistle )

21:03.388 --> 21:05.140
and then top it off
with a ( squish )

21:05.224 --> 21:06.725
and if there's time
before commercial

21:06.808 --> 21:09.645
be ready with a
wah-wah-wah-wah.

21:09.728 --> 21:10.812
Oh, my God.

21:10.896 --> 21:12.648
You don't care about
him at all, do you?

21:12.731 --> 21:14.566
All you care about are
your stupid ratings.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.610
You're a horrible man.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.362
Neil, I'm sorry!

21:18.445 --> 21:19.613
Meg?

21:19.696 --> 21:20.781
Uh-oh.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.324
There he goes.
( gasps )

21:22.407 --> 21:24.201
Good stuff, good stuff,
good stuff, good stuff!

21:24.284 --> 21:25.494
Neil!

21:25.577 --> 21:26.620
( thud )

21:26.703 --> 21:27.704
Meg.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.498
You do care.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.291
Don't read too much
into this, Neil.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.709
Well, it's hard not to

21:32.793 --> 21:35.087
when I'm lying right
on top of you.

21:35.170 --> 21:37.464
Look, just because
you're repulsive

21:37.548 --> 21:39.758
and probably the most annoying
person on the planet--

21:39.842 --> 21:41.677
and I'm not the only
person who thinks so--

21:41.760 --> 21:44.054
that doesn't mean I want you to go
and kill yourself.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.889
Ah, thanks, Meg.

21:45.973 --> 21:47.808
But I was never really
planning to jump.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.268
Wasn't going
to jump?

21:49.351 --> 21:50.644
You're a phony!

21:50.727 --> 21:52.020
Hey, everybody!

21:52.104 --> 21:54.147
This guy's a
great big phony!
