He always treated me okay.

They didn't have to kill him.

50:53.668 --> 50:55.038
You guys want a drink?

50:57.293 --> 50:59.503
I got some pretty good whisky.

50:59.710 --> 51:00.880
I'm good.

51:01.001 --> 51:02.501
I'll try a little bit
of that whisky, Kimberly.

51:02.585 --> 51:04.165
So how long have you known Reggie?

51:04.251 --> 51:06.291
- We're old pals.
- And you're here on holiday?

51:06.501 --> 51:08.791
No, just a quick in and out.

51:09.001 --> 51:10.881
- You're together?
- Yes, we are.

51:11.626 --> 51:14.666
No, Kimberly, we are not together.
I'm a heterosexual man.

51:14.793 --> 51:16.463
He's also a heterosexual man.

51:17.001 --> 51:18.631
Well, good for you, honey.

51:19.585 --> 51:21.535
You know, you should go
to the Blue Lagoon.

51:21.626 --> 51:23.496
It's very refreshing.

51:23.585 --> 51:24.665
I'm sure it is.

51:24.751 --> 51:26.041
I go there a lot.

51:26.126 --> 51:27.206
I'm sure you do.

51:29.335 --> 51:30.665
I hope you choke on it.

51:32.293 --> 51:33.713
(CHUCKLES)

51:36.626 --> 51:38.496
So Reggie is gay, huh?

51:39.710 --> 51:42.420
If Kimberly has a dick,
which I'm assuming she does,

51:42.501 --> 51:45.171
then that would make Reggie gay, yes.

51:45.251 --> 51:46.631
Possibly bisexual.

51:46.793 --> 51:49.630
Well, what if Kimberly doesn't have...
Like, if she's already...

51:49.710 --> 51:50.960
- Post-op?
- Yeah.

51:51.043 --> 51:52.463
That's a good question.

51:52.543 --> 51:56.093
That would make Kimberly a woman,
which would make Reggie straight.

51:56.460 --> 51:58.920
- Would it?
- With an asterisk.

51:59.293 --> 52:02.003
- But if Reggie is gay...
- Mmm-hmm?

52:02.085 --> 52:05.415
...do you think
Reggie and Pádraic, they...

52:06.543 --> 52:08.921
What the fuck is that,
the international symbol for sodomy?

52:09.001 --> 52:11.251
- You know exactly what this is.
- (LAUGHS)

52:34.085 --> 52:36.335

to do that in here.

(MANGAN INHALES)

52:38.543 --> 52:41.753
In fact, I don't think you're allowed
to do that anywhere.

52:41.835 --> 52:44.205
I've just realised
what you remind me of, Russell.

52:45.751 --> 52:47.541
A bloody Cyclops.

52:47.626 --> 52:49.666
I don't know what that means
and you know I don't.

52:49.751 --> 52:52.041
You never read the Odyssey
at school, Russell?

52:52.793 --> 52:54.423
You do surprise me.

52:55.126 --> 52:56.456
I read it in the original Greek

52:56.543 --> 52:58.633
when I was travelling through
the Peloponnese with my father.

52:59.668 --> 53:01.748
I lost my fucking eye!

53:01.835 --> 53:03.375
Calm down.

53:03.460 --> 53:05.210
You still have one good one.

53:08.293 --> 53:10.503
I'm gonna fuck over
those fucking assholes...

53:10.585 --> 53:12.375
No, you're not.
You're not gonna fuck over anyone.

53:12.460 --> 53:14.710
They're still policemen, after all.

53:15.501 --> 53:21.088
I don't wanna get into some kinda fucking
contretemps with you, Your Lordship,

53:21.168 --> 53:23.378
especially not in my condition.

53:23.460 --> 53:25.590
But I do believe
you're being overly cautious.

53:25.751 --> 53:29.131
Do you know who the greatest criminal
that ever lived is?

53:32.835 --> 53:35.085
- No, I don't know.
- No, you don't.

53:35.960 --> 53:37.500
Because if you did,

53:37.585 --> 53:40.125
he wouldn't be the greatest criminal

53:40.210 --> 53:42.920
that ever fucking lived, now,
would he? Hmm?

53:43.001 --> 53:45.711
Fuck, man, that's just the crack talking.

53:46.585 --> 53:49.745
But to put your mind at ease,
I shall have a word with them.

53:51.001 --> 53:53.251
Give them a little reducer,

53:53.335 --> 53:54.835

53:55.293 --> 53:56.423
Yeah?

53:57.960 --> 54:00.130
What if it doesn't take?

54:00.210 --> 54:02.290
Eat your grapes, Russell.

Eat your grapes.

Bob, that shitbird's going down.

To where, fucking Iceland?

54:36.626 --> 54:39.416
- No, we were in Iceland!
- Yeah.

54:39.668 --> 54:41.378
Bob, that shit's not funny any more.

54:41.460 --> 54:44.880
Not that it was funny to begin with,
so I don't even know why I said that.

54:44.960 --> 54:48.000
Anyway, during your unexplained absence,

54:48.210 --> 54:51.710
I received a very serious
allegation of assault.

54:51.793 --> 54:53.630
This Russell Birdwell character.

54:53.710 --> 54:55.170
- Fuck him!
- No, Terry!

54:55.251 --> 54:56.711
Fuck you!

54:56.793 --> 55:00.588
How many times do I have to tell you?

55:00.668 --> 55:03.668
His lawyer is threatening to have you
arraigned on attempted murder charges.

55:03.751 --> 55:06.338
Murder charges? He was shooting at us,
for Christ's sake!

55:06.418 --> 55:07.838

- Oh.
- That's it. Fucking pussy.

55:09.751 --> 55:10.880
Well, he claims

55:10.960 --> 55:13.750
you failed to identify yourselves
as police officers,

55:13.835 --> 55:16.285
which is why he fled the scene.

55:16.460 --> 55:19.380
Those are what we call
mitigating circumstances.

one of his eyes

those are not what we call
mitigating circumstances. Capisce?

55:28.293 --> 55:30.921
I told you, Birdwell's part
of an ongoing investigation.

55:31.001 --> 55:32.671
We're gonna get it cleared up in two days.

55:32.751 --> 55:36.751
Well, you'd better,
cos this shit's not going away.

55:36.835 --> 55:38.165
Meanwhile, I had to release the prick,

55:38.251 --> 55:40.251
- pending further investigation.
- Oh, fuck me!

01:27:27.793 --> 01:27:31.753
And at the start, the tutor
grabs a chair, puts it on a desk

01:27:31.835 --> 01:27:33.535
and says, "For your last test,

01:27:34.793 --> 01:27:36.503
"prove this chair exists."

01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:39.036
So everyone's scribbling away,

01:27:39.668 --> 01:27:40.918
except one guy.

01:27:41.001 --> 01:27:43.921
He writes two words, gets up,

01:27:44.085 --> 01:27:46.745
hands his paper to the tutor,

01:27:46.835 --> 01:27:48.495
leaves the class.

01:27:48.585 --> 01:27:49.955
Tutor looks at it

01:27:50.585 --> 01:27:52.125
and on it, it says,

01:27:52.751 --> 01:27:54.131
"What chair?"

01:27:56.793 --> 01:27:58.043
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.000
Well, that's certainly very...

01:28:05.835 --> 01:28:06.915
MANGAN: Fuck!

01:28:07.001 --> 01:28:08.211
(SHRIEKS)

01:28:13.751 --> 01:28:15.291
(SHRIEKS)

01:28:16.001 --> 01:28:17.091
(GRUNTS)

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:20.003
Fuck!

01:28:20.585 --> 01:28:21.665
(SCREAMS)

01:28:29.876 --> 01:28:31.126
(GRUNTING)

01:28:43.626 --> 01:28:45.376
(BIRDWELL WHIMPERING)

01:28:52.335 --> 01:28:53.415
Bob?

01:29:00.626 --> 01:29:01.706
Bob?

01:29:06.876 --> 01:29:08.246
(EXHALES)

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:19.380
I love bulletproof vests.

01:29:21.168 --> 01:29:22.788
Let's go fuck these scumbags.

01:29:24.710 --> 01:29:26.290
(BIRDWELL SOBBING)

01:29:42.293 --> 01:29:43.383
(SPITS)

01:29:44.043 --> 01:29:45.383
(PANTING)

01:29:49.876 --> 01:29:51.706
I killed your snitch.

01:29:54.793 --> 01:29:56.923
I chopped his fucking head off!

01:30:01.168 --> 01:30:02.248
Wait.

01:30:04.918 --> 01:30:05.998
Don't...

01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:09.880
I knew your last words would be shit.

01:30:11.418 --> 01:30:12.838
(GUNSHOT ECHOES)

01:30:19.501 --> 01:30:20.591
All right.

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.168
All right, you made your point.

01:30:24.793 --> 01:30:25.923
(MANGAN LAUGHS)

01:30:30.085 --> 01:30:31.835
How much is this gonna cost me?

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:33.996
It's gonna cost you your life.

01:30:35.835 --> 01:30:36.995
Nice line.

01:30:48.668 --> 01:30:50.378
TERRY: Well, that's a damn shame.

01:30:51.793 --> 01:30:54.133
I kinda liked the guy,
in a funny sort of way.

01:30:54.251 --> 01:30:56.591
His hair was receding quite a bit.

01:30:58.335 --> 01:30:59.995
His teeth are all fucked up.

01:31:00.626 --> 01:31:01.706
What are you doing?

01:31:01.835 --> 01:31:03.625
Well, we gotta give him a decent burial.

01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:06.961
What are we, savages?

01:31:07.085 --> 01:31:10.035
Thought you were, like, keeping him
as a souvenir or something.

01:31:11.501 --> 01:31:14.961
So that story about
the philosophy exam and the chair.

01:31:15.043 --> 01:31:16.793
What does that actually mean?

01:31:17.293 --> 01:31:19.338
It's not supposed to mean anything.

01:31:19.418 --> 01:31:21.168
It's like a Zen koan.

01:31:21.251 --> 01:31:22.921
Just ponder on it.

01:31:23.001 --> 01:31:24.461
Just ponder on it?

01:31:24.543 --> 01:31:26.293
Yeah. I fucked it up, though.

01:31:26.376 --> 01:31:30.086
I was supposed to say,
"Prove the chair doesn't exist."

01:31:31.335 --> 01:31:32.835
Ah!

01:31:32.918 --> 01:31:34.668
So it doesn't exist, huh?

01:31:52.126 --> 01:31:54.206
Man, that was some cold shit.

01:32:03.668 --> 01:32:07.128
(GENTLE ON MY MIND BY GLENN FREY PLAYING)

01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:30.130
DOLORES: Wait, you going in?

01:32:30.210 --> 01:32:31.290
(SHRIEKS)

01:32:32.168 --> 01:32:33.918
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

01:32:41.418 --> 01:32:42.538
(LAUGHS)

01:32:43.043 --> 01:32:44.673
So what's next, man?

01:32:45.918 --> 01:32:47.668
I'm gonna live slow,

01:32:47.751 --> 01:32:49.791
die old and leave an ugly-looking corpse.

01:32:50.210 --> 01:32:51.380
What are you gonna do?

01:32:52.751 --> 01:32:54.091
I don't know.

01:32:55.376 --> 01:32:56.706
Something sedate.

01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:58.590
(LAUGHING)

01:32:59.085 --> 01:33:00.875
You think you're capable of being sedate?

01:33:02.293 --> 01:33:04.293
Well, Bob, it's like
the Buddha once said...

01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:06.500
You're quoting fucking Buddha now?

01:33:06.585 --> 01:33:08.745
Do not dwell in the past,

01:33:09.668 --> 01:33:11.498
do not dream of the future.

01:33:12.251 --> 01:33:15.131
Concentrate the mind
on the present moment.

01:33:16.168 --> 01:33:17.708
(LAUGHS)

01:33:21.876 --> 01:33:24.206
(I FOUGHT THE LAW BY THE CLASH PLAYING)

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.590
I love this song.

01:33:26.751 --> 01:33:27.881
Great song.

01:33:29.835 --> 01:33:30.915
Masterpiece.

01:33:33.793 --> 01:33:36.173
(SONG CONTINUES)
