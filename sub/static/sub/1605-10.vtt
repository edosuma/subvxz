01:13.856 --> 01:14.876
I'm not gay.

01:14.996 --> 01:16.358
All right.
I'm just saying,

01:16.390 --> 01:19.152
I've noticed a pattern developing
around breakfast time.

01:19.278 --> 01:21.614
See, you come in late,
just before Vause.

01:21.739 --> 01:23.824
Strategically
staggered arrival?

01:24.241 --> 01:25.618
Sounds familiar.

01:25.701 --> 01:28.662
No, absolutely not.
That's ridiculous.

01:29.121 --> 01:32.124
Okay, where were you then?
'Cause I went by your cube...

01:32.249 --> 01:33.292
Where was I?

01:33.417 --> 01:35.461
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:35.544 --> 01:37.170
Shh. Show, don't tell.

01:39.339 --> 01:42.008
So, yes, Alex and I have been
spending a lot of time together

01:42.551 --> 01:44.010
but it's not like I'm...

01:44.136 --> 01:45.536
What, rejoining
the softball league?

01:47.097 --> 01:49.516
No, softball is the furthest
thing from my mind.

01:49.725 --> 01:50.810
Oh, no, let me be clear.

01:50.935 --> 01:54.146
By softball, I meant two in her
front and then one in the butt,

01:54.229 --> 01:57.149
and then just eating her pussy a
lot, 'cause you like it so much.

01:57.274 --> 01:59.754
Let me explain something to you...
And playing with her titties.

02:00.068 --> 02:02.571
Alex and I are
very old friends.

02:03.155 --> 02:05.031
We have an affectionate
relationship.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.117
I need that.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.662
I'm human.
It's about comfort, right?

02:09.829 --> 02:12.205
Hey, Morello, remember when we
used to comfort each other?

02:12.331 --> 02:14.583
Sure. You were
very comfortable.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.126
Hey, guys.

02:16.209 --> 02:17.419
Just barely made breakfast.

02:18.086 --> 02:19.713
Long shower line?

02:19.839 --> 02:21.507
Yeah, it was
really awful today.

02:21.590 --> 02:23.175
Your hair's dry.

02:36.146 --> 02:37.815
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

02:41.318 --> 02:43.195
(POUNDING CONTINUES)

02:46.991 --> 02:47.992
Hey!

02:48.074 --> 02:50.577
I can't believe people
actually live up here, bro.

02:50.703 --> 02:51.662
Excuse me.

02:51.745 --> 02:54.790
There is, like, nothing around.

02:55.207 --> 02:56.208
What the fuck?

02:56.709 --> 02:57.835
(YELLS EXCITEDLY)

02:59.169 --> 03:00.420
Oh, shit.

03:03.173 --> 03:04.383
You're like RoboCop.

03:04.508 --> 03:05.885
I think you have
the wrong house.

03:06.010 --> 03:08.595
No, I get it now.
You can't get a real job.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.264
That's why they got you
up here in Sleepy Hollow.

03:11.390 --> 03:13.017
Yo, Daya know you're a cyborg?

03:14.393 --> 03:15.352
Excuse me?

03:15.435 --> 03:17.479
I guess she must by now, right?

03:18.022 --> 03:19.063
Okay, who the hell are you?

03:21.817 --> 03:23.694
I'm a friend of
the family, bro.

03:24.319 --> 03:26.864
All right. Well,
you need to leave. Now.

03:26.947 --> 03:29.074
When I heard what was going on,

03:29.199 --> 03:30.743
I got really concerned,

03:31.618 --> 03:33.495
because I love them Diaz girls.

03:33.579 --> 03:37.583
And then I heard it was a prison
guard slipping it to my Daya, papo.

03:38.291 --> 03:42.004
I know you're not taking her
to a dinner and a movie first.

03:42.588 --> 03:43.630
But I hear you was in the army,

03:43.756 --> 03:45.117
so I figure you
must have some kind

03:45.215 --> 03:47.009
of honor code
or something, right?

03:48.260 --> 03:49.720
You wouldn't just
get a girl pregnant

03:49.845 --> 03:51.304
and forget about her,
would you?

03:53.473 --> 03:54.600
What?

03:54.767 --> 03:56.101
Where are you gonna
put the crib, bro?

03:56.226 --> 03:57.266
What are you talking about?

03:57.310 --> 03:58.771
It's kind of
cramped in here, bro.

03:58.854 --> 04:01.356
Maybe you should think about
getting a two bedroom.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.191
So kids can have
their own room.

04:05.318 --> 04:07.571
For when you're
fucking bitches.

04:13.285 --> 04:14.536
Oh, gosh!

04:21.043 --> 04:23.629
Am I crazy or do these cards
smell faintly like urine?

04:23.754 --> 04:24.964
Smell that.
Ew!

04:25.089 --> 04:26.256
Stop it. Get it away
from my face.

04:26.339 --> 04:28.592
What? Is it bringing
back memories?

04:28.675 --> 04:30.135
What? Fifty Shades
of Crazy Eyes.

04:30.260 --> 04:31.804
(LAUGHS) Stop it.
Smell it.

04:31.929 --> 04:33.449
Why are you trying
to look at my cards?

04:33.472 --> 04:34.890
Cut it out.
I know how you play.

04:34.974 --> 04:36.475
Don't you look at my cards!
Stop it. Cut it out.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.060
Why you doing that?

04:44.483 --> 04:46.526
It's weird how
normal this feels.

04:46.693 --> 04:47.694
What?

04:47.820 --> 04:50.447
I feel like I'm 23
and no time has passed.

04:53.492 --> 04:56.745
Well, I think that when you
have a connection with someone,

04:56.829 --> 04:58.664
it never really
goes away, you know?

05:00.958 --> 05:04.503
You snap back to being important to
each other because you still are.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.720
But I've changed so much
since we were together.

05:09.758 --> 05:11.176
Haven't you?
No.

05:11.343 --> 05:14.513
No, not really.
I'm pretty consistent.

05:16.015 --> 05:17.099
Can I ask you something?

05:17.307 --> 05:18.350
Yeah.

05:18.475 --> 05:21.770
Do you think it's odd I haven't heard
from Larry since Thanksgiving?

05:22.938 --> 05:24.356
You know,
maybe he's mad at me that

05:24.481 --> 05:25.858
I wasn't able to see him
while I was in SHU.

05:25.941 --> 05:28.027
But that would be totally
fucked up, wouldn't it?

05:28.110 --> 05:29.471
I'm not sure
you're in the position

05:29.528 --> 05:30.889
to feel indignant
right now, Piper.

05:31.864 --> 05:33.115
Do you think I'm
a terrible person?

05:33.197 --> 05:37.452
No! I think that we do what
we need to do to survive.

05:37.619 --> 05:39.872
Hey! What the hell
you think you're doing?

05:39.955 --> 05:41.040
Nothing.

05:41.123 --> 05:43.083
You. Gimme your shoes.
What?

05:43.207 --> 05:45.669
You deaf or something? Take
off your motherfucking shoes!

05:47.046 --> 05:48.172
Hey, back off, all right?

05:48.338 --> 05:51.215
Oh, you about to step?
Oh!

05:54.678 --> 05:56.220
(BOTH LAUGHING)

05:56.680 --> 05:59.725
Your face, yo!
You was like...

05:59.892 --> 06:02.853
"Hey, back off."
You so gangsta.

06:02.936 --> 06:04.188
Give me some, give me some.

06:04.312 --> 06:05.564
All right, inmates.

06:05.689 --> 06:08.232
Enough.
Save it for the kids.

06:08.358 --> 06:09.693
What's going on?

06:09.776 --> 06:11.862
Yo, scared straight in the
house, y'all, ya know?

06:12.696 --> 06:14.781
I'ma scare us some bad kids.

06:14.907 --> 06:18.160
I'ma go platinum up on them
whippersnappers! Yeah!

06:18.242 --> 06:20.871
I'm gonna make them shit their
little delinquent panties!

06:20.954 --> 06:22.206
BELL: Hey.

06:22.288 --> 06:24.917
Ladies, this is serious.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.251
These kids are
going down a bad path.

06:27.335 --> 06:30.672
Your jobs are to deter them from
making the same mistakes you did.

06:30.839 --> 06:32.424
But we can make
them cry, right?

06:32.507 --> 06:33.588
Yeah, you can make them cry.

06:33.633 --> 06:35.594
Yeah. I'ma make them
cry all right.

06:35.719 --> 06:37.429
Cry like they're going
through a haunted house,

06:37.512 --> 06:38.805
haunted house called "life."

06:38.931 --> 06:41.474
I thought you said this was
an acting opportunity.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.809
It is.

06:42.935 --> 06:44.519
You want to sign up?

06:44.603 --> 06:45.812
No, I don't.

06:46.146 --> 06:48.356
Other prisons get to do
Shakespeare and shit.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.775
I want to play a role.

06:49.900 --> 06:53.695
Like Desdemona, or Ophelia,
or Clair Huxtable.

06:53.779 --> 06:55.030
Tell you what.

06:55.114 --> 06:56.949
You can play
whatever character you want,

06:57.032 --> 07:00.410
so long as that character is the
stuff of naughty brats' nightmares.

07:01.036 --> 07:03.288
Yeah. I can do that.

07:04.456 --> 07:05.624
Line up!

07:11.421 --> 07:14.382
You know, I don't do much
of the cooking at home.

07:14.466 --> 07:15.884
Christopher's
the one who cooks.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.302
Really?

07:17.427 --> 07:18.748
Yeah, and not just
out of the box.

07:19.304 --> 07:21.306
All fancy ingredients.

07:21.807 --> 07:26.311
Bucatini. You ever hear of that?
It's like a hollow spaghetti.

07:26.895 --> 07:29.064
He made that once
with a clam sauce.

07:29.439 --> 07:30.941
You know,
you can go if you want.

07:31.066 --> 07:32.609
I have everything
under control.

07:32.692 --> 07:34.653
Oh, no, I like helping.

07:37.322 --> 07:38.490
Hello, ladies.

07:40.117 --> 07:44.121
Red, you happen to have those ice
cream bars that I asked for?

07:58.135 --> 07:59.385
It's not ice cream, is it?

08:02.597 --> 08:06.185
Hey! Look who's back
from the dungeon of doom.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.311
TRICIA: Hey, what's up?

08:09.729 --> 08:10.730
Hey, Red.

08:13.775 --> 08:19.364
So I detoxed. You know, I'm clean now.
Drug-free America, yo.

08:19.531 --> 08:23.660
What do you want, a medal? A
sticker that says, "great job"?

08:24.244 --> 08:26.538
Well, no. I just thought...
What did you think?

08:27.331 --> 08:29.541
That everything would be fine?

08:29.708 --> 08:34.587
I have one rule. No drugs.
You lied to my face.

08:35.714 --> 08:37.756
You're on your own.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.345
Fine.

08:42.679 --> 08:45.891
Excuse me, sir. Spare a little change?
Even a quarter?

08:46.016 --> 08:49.144
Hello, ma'am, a little help, please?
I'm so hungry.

08:52.689 --> 08:54.066
Yo, what's so funny?

08:54.149 --> 08:55.901
You're trying too hard.

08:55.984 --> 08:57.069
People don't
wanna give anything

08:57.152 --> 08:58.473
unless they think
it's their idea.

09:00.739 --> 09:01.823
See?

09:03.116 --> 09:04.659
Yeah, great,
except their idea is that

09:04.743 --> 09:06.984
a dime and three pennies is
gonna get us something to eat.

09:08.830 --> 09:09.873
Come on, take a break.

09:13.085 --> 09:16.088
Here.

09:17.714 --> 09:19.674
Where'd you get this?
Whole Foods.

09:19.841 --> 09:20.926
You didn't see me, right?

09:21.009 --> 09:22.094
No.

09:22.719 --> 09:24.137
'Cause I'm smooth like that.

09:24.971 --> 09:27.473
Here, I got us a carrot too,

09:27.599 --> 09:29.393
so our diet is
balanced and shit.

09:29.851 --> 09:31.270
Dinner, dessert.

09:31.395 --> 09:33.438
I'm no good at stealing.

09:33.563 --> 09:35.124
It's not stealing.
I'm gonna pay for it.

09:35.941 --> 09:37.109
What are you talking about?

09:37.192 --> 09:38.360
Check it out.

09:41.113 --> 09:42.281
I keep a log, yo.

09:42.406 --> 09:44.991
I'm not about stealing. See?

09:45.117 --> 09:47.660
When I leave this world, I
ain't owing nobody nothing.

09:50.289 --> 09:53.292
Hey. One of you want
to come to a party?

09:53.458 --> 09:54.459
Fuck off.

09:54.584 --> 09:57.254
Well, fuck you too, street rat.

09:57.921 --> 10:00.299
Motherfucker looks
like my rapist step-dad.

10:00.382 --> 10:01.925
Wanna go somewhere else?

10:02.050 --> 10:03.593
In a minute,
I'm charging my phone.

10:04.844 --> 10:07.264
Hey, you gonna pay for that
electricity too someday?

10:08.640 --> 10:11.768
Shit. I never thought
about it like that.

10:12.727 --> 10:16.815
Don't take too much off.
I just want it to look neat.

10:17.357 --> 10:19.692
Relax.
It's not like I'm exactly

10:19.818 --> 10:22.195
overwhelmed with
the possibilities.

10:23.155 --> 10:24.197
So when's your visitor?

10:25.157 --> 10:26.325
Who said I had a visitor?

10:26.450 --> 10:28.452
You've never let
me touch your head,

10:28.534 --> 10:31.496
and I would take it personally if
I didn't know how cheap you are

10:31.621 --> 10:32.872
with your commissary.

10:32.998 --> 10:35.875
He must be pretty special for you
to part with all those Tums.

10:36.001 --> 10:37.377
It's a friend.

10:37.502 --> 10:40.172
Someone I haven't
seen in a long time.

10:40.255 --> 10:41.381
How long?

10:41.506 --> 10:42.841
Ten years.

10:44.176 --> 10:45.177
Oh.

10:46.178 --> 10:47.762
That is a long time.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.353
Think I know
what we're gonna do.

10:57.356 --> 11:01.026
What? What radio program?

11:01.193 --> 11:04.321
Oh, yeah. You know
that show Urban Tales?

11:04.446 --> 11:05.489
With Maury Kind?

11:05.655 --> 11:07.531
Yeah, he was at Thanksgiving.

11:07.699 --> 11:10.035
He looks nothing like
he sounds on the radio.

11:10.827 --> 11:12.536
Who is that?
It's Neri.

11:13.288 --> 11:17.501
Anyhow. He's doing a show about long
distance relationships next Sunday.

11:17.583 --> 11:20.212
And that's probably why
you haven't heard from him.

11:20.295 --> 11:22.506
He's probably
working on his show.

11:22.588 --> 11:25.884
About our relationship?
What is he gonna say?

11:26.051 --> 11:30.514
I don't know, good stuff. I better
go now, we're just heading out.

11:31.097 --> 11:33.058
We're going to shoot guns!

11:33.183 --> 11:34.226
Guns?

11:34.600 --> 11:38.897
No, just cans.
Cans, with guns.

11:38.980 --> 11:40.399
You hate guns.

11:40.482 --> 11:41.941
It's just an air rifle.
No, it's not.

11:42.067 --> 11:45.569
Okay, bye, Piper, love
you, stay out of the stew.

11:45.737 --> 11:48.240
SHU. The SHU.

11:48.365 --> 11:49.741
Yeah, isn't that what I said?

11:51.617 --> 11:52.744
Bye.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.416
Hey, guys, what's the hold up?

11:57.581 --> 11:59.543
Dude. You need
to talk to Piper.

Was that her?

12:00.835 --> 12:03.195
She wants to know why you're not picking up.
She sounded mad.

12:03.213 --> 12:04.381
She's mad?

12:05.257 --> 12:07.300
Did you ask her why
she went to the SHU?

12:07.426 --> 12:08.927
No. That's none
of my business.

12:10.429 --> 12:13.723
Dude, look, you can stay
here, we can go shoot guns,

12:13.806 --> 12:15.486
you can help me set up
my maple syrup taps,

12:15.599 --> 12:17.643
but you have to
talk to my sister.

12:17.810 --> 12:19.603

out what to say. You know.

can't get ahold of him.

to be on the radio.

No. No. Public radio.

He's going to be
talking about me.

12:44.796 --> 12:46.381
He's going to be
talking about how

12:46.465 --> 12:50.218
my going to prison
affects him, as a partner.

12:51.803 --> 12:52.804
Oh.

12:54.097 --> 12:55.218
Do you need to use the phone?

12:55.974 --> 12:59.561
I just tried. You know, Mercy and
me, we haven't talked in a while.

12:59.643 --> 13:01.980
So, I can't get through either.

feeling a little jealous?

I like hot girls.
And I like hot boys.

I like hot people.
What can I say, I'm shallow.

13:52.572 --> 13:55.534
You keep looking for people you
have that chemical thing with,

13:55.617 --> 13:56.951
but that's not
the whole package.

13:57.785 --> 13:59.912
You have to find someone
you can spend two weeks with

14:01.873 --> 14:03.583

and not want to kill.

14:04.668 --> 14:08.547
He made jigsaw puzzles
fun and competitive.

14:08.712 --> 14:10.549
That sounds truly boring.

14:10.674 --> 14:12.091
When I put my cold feet on him,

14:12.217 --> 14:15.803
he's always warm
and only sometimes annoyed.

14:16.304 --> 14:19.432
But I want both. I want
warm, but I also want hot.

had enough room for the crib.

you going to tell me?

Why not?

Because I am a CO. I could go
to jail as a sex offender.

I know about that.

Okay. Okay, right.

23:14.425 --> 23:17.762
I'll get some Neosporin.
And some hydrogen peroxide.

23:17.887 --> 23:18.930
Maybe some iodine?

23:19.055 --> 23:21.057
I'll check the bathroom.

23:25.061 --> 23:27.479
So what happened?
What dog?

23:27.605 --> 23:29.148
I don't know, some street kid.

23:29.272 --> 23:30.273
What?

23:31.109 --> 23:34.445
Yeah, some homeless kid was
asking for money for dog food,

23:34.528 --> 23:37.368
and I was like, "If you can't afford
dog food, you shouldn't have a dog."

23:39.033 --> 23:42.285
So you lectured a homeless kid.
I'm sure he loved that.

23:42.411 --> 23:44.080
No, I didn't lecture him,
I just made a point.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.925
And then he was like,
"It's for protection."

23:45.957 --> 23:48.042
And I was like, "That dog
is not protecting anybody."

23:48.333 --> 23:49.543
And then what happened?

23:51.294 --> 23:53.631
And then it bit me.
Pretty hard.

23:54.757 --> 23:56.341
You should probably
get a tetanus shot.

23:56.467 --> 23:58.136
I'll be fine.

23:59.637 --> 24:01.639
The dog looked a lot
cleaner than the kid.

24:01.722 --> 24:04.391
Besides, I'm going to see a brass band...
(WINCES) Ow!

24:06.102 --> 24:08.229
I'm going to see a brass band
at Zebulon tonight.

24:08.311 --> 24:12.233
Oh, yeah, the Hungry March Band, right?
I was supposed to go to that.

24:13.025 --> 24:14.193
Really?
Yeah.

24:14.317 --> 24:17.320
You were? Yeah, but
then I sat down.

24:17.446 --> 24:18.447
(LAUGHS)

24:18.572 --> 24:20.574
Gravity works
very strongly on me.

24:20.658 --> 24:23.661
Especially when
it's sweltering outside

24:23.786 --> 24:26.914
and when Almost Famous is
playing for the 400th time.

24:27.330 --> 24:30.209
Yeah. Plus, I'm
plant-sitting, so, you know,

24:30.333 --> 24:32.461
if I went anywhere I'd
have to take them with me,

24:32.544 --> 24:35.631
and I'm not sure if
they're all over 21. So...

24:41.929 --> 24:45.683
Look, this is silly. You
should really take a shower.

24:45.808 --> 24:47.350
Or even a bath.
You know, just soak it.

24:47.518 --> 24:49.158
You know, you really
need to clean it out.

24:49.187 --> 24:50.353
I mean, you don't
want to get an infection.

24:50.479 --> 24:53.732
Or rabies. Do you feel
any flu-like symptoms?

24:53.858 --> 24:56.902
Because, if it is rabies, you
need to treat it right away,

24:57.028 --> 24:59.280
I mean there is no cure.
You'll die.

24:59.613 --> 25:02.158
Wow. Dark.

25:02.407 --> 25:03.450
Jew.

25:03.534 --> 25:07.454
Uh, well, I can go back to my
place if you need privacy.

25:07.538 --> 25:11.083
That's okay.
I can shut the bathroom door.

25:16.130 --> 25:17.715
Hey, have you eaten?

25:18.299 --> 25:19.342
What?

25:19.424 --> 25:22.761
I was just about to order some Chinese food.
So if you haven't eaten...

25:23.221 --> 25:26.807
Unless you're meeting
someone before the show...

25:29.101 --> 25:33.231
No. I'm not.
Chinese sounds great.

25:34.565 --> 25:36.942
I'll have whatever
you're having.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.077
They didn't call your name,
you don't have a visitor.

25:46.244 --> 25:49.080
But maybe there is a mistake.

25:49.580 --> 25:52.208
Please, can you double check?

25:54.668 --> 25:56.587
Yeah, O'Neill,
you sure you don't have

25:56.712 --> 25:58.630
anybody on the list for Pelage?

25:58.756 --> 26:02.634
O'NEILL: Miss Claudette? Come on,
that joke's older than my nana.

26:03.594 --> 26:05.637
It's not a joke this time.

26:06.305 --> 26:07.765
Wait.

26:07.848 --> 26:11.643
Yeah, yeah, she's on the list.
Sorry, I thought it was a joke.

26:34.417 --> 26:36.294
Am I allowed to touch you?

26:49.598 --> 26:52.310
What do you think
about Bora Bora Bora?

26:52.435 --> 26:53.852
What?

26:54.728 --> 26:55.980
You mean Bora Bora?

26:56.105 --> 26:58.983
No, no, I think
there's three "Boras."

26:59.066 --> 27:01.026
I've been thinking about it
for our honeymoon.

27:01.152 --> 27:04.280
I mean, I know Christopher's
got his mind set on Madrid,

27:04.363 --> 27:06.824
but all those enchiladas,
I get gassy.

27:06.949 --> 27:09.034
That's a conversation you should
probably have with Christopher.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.578
Oh, yeah, but you've traveled.

27:11.829 --> 27:13.414
Not to Bora Bora.

27:13.747 --> 27:14.915
...Bora.

27:16.250 --> 27:17.293
Hey, Trish.

27:18.043 --> 27:19.170
Yeah. Hey.

27:19.378 --> 27:20.499
Did you get through to Mercy?

27:20.503 --> 27:23.007
Oh, no. Not yet.
But, you know, it's cool.

27:28.304 --> 27:31.556
She came by the kitchen
earlier, to give Red an olive.

27:32.183 --> 27:33.267
What?

27:33.392 --> 27:34.852
An olive.

27:35.311 --> 27:37.229
Saying an olive branch.
All right?

27:37.688 --> 27:41.192
Either way. Red don't want
nothing to do with her.

27:41.317 --> 27:43.361
But she turned
herself in for Red.

27:43.486 --> 27:45.606
And she's got more time on
her sentence because of her.

27:45.654 --> 27:47.156
Yeah, well,
she brought it on herself.

27:47.239 --> 27:49.283
I mean, she told Pornstache
about the trucks.

27:49.367 --> 27:50.826
She's a Judas Priest.

27:50.909 --> 27:51.952
Who told you that?

27:52.077 --> 27:53.120
Well, it's obvious,

27:53.204 --> 27:56.415
and I think it's disgusting after
everything Red's done for her.

27:56.874 --> 27:58.125
It's not true.

27:59.043 --> 28:01.483
I mean, you don't know, so watch
it with the rumors, all right?

28:01.544 --> 28:02.880
What's the matter with you?

28:04.507 --> 28:05.716
Nothing.

28:08.302 --> 28:10.888
You still mad 'cause we're
not sleeping together?

28:11.013 --> 28:12.806
Oh, Christ...

28:12.931 --> 28:15.226
That's it.
Oh, come on, Nichols,

28:15.393 --> 28:17.686
it's better this way.
Being friends.

28:18.687 --> 28:21.564
You know I miss it,
too, sometimes,

28:21.690 --> 28:24.567
but I gotta stay
true to Christopher.

28:25.110 --> 28:27.154
God, please no more about
fucking Christopher.

28:27.238 --> 28:30.866
I can't cheat on him. You
know I can't cheat on him.

28:31.575 --> 28:32.701
Yeah, I know you
can't cheat on him.

28:32.784 --> 28:35.246
You know why? Because Christopher
doesn't fucking exist,

28:35.371 --> 28:37.248
at least not in your life.

28:37.373 --> 28:40.376
He hasn't visited you since
three weeks after you got here.

28:40.584 --> 28:42.002
That's not true.

28:42.086 --> 28:44.296
Yeah, it is,
and everybody knows it.

28:44.547 --> 28:45.923
And the only reason
nobody says anything

28:46.090 --> 28:47.425
is 'cause they're
embarrassed for you,

28:47.550 --> 28:48.717
because it's pathetic.

28:50.511 --> 28:51.762
But I'm sick of it.

28:51.845 --> 28:56.225
Just like I'm sick of you talking about
things you don't know anything about.

28:57.601 --> 28:58.894
Fuck you.

28:59.103 --> 29:00.812
Hey! Fuck you, too.

29:02.773 --> 29:05.776
Yeah, go do your make-believe
somewhere else.

29:05.901 --> 29:08.028
I don't have
patience for it anymore.

29:46.317 --> 29:48.026
LITTLE ALLIE: Hey! Trish?

29:48.777 --> 29:50.821
Trish, how's it going?
Hi!

29:50.946 --> 29:52.823
Where you been?
It's been forever, yo.

29:52.990 --> 29:55.284
I got a job in a kitchen.

29:55.367 --> 29:56.827
Around here?
Yeah, yeah.

29:56.994 --> 30:00.164
Well, you gotta come by
the park sometime and say hi.

30:00.331 --> 30:03.250
I should. I will.
Yeah. Where you staying?

30:03.792 --> 30:05.669
You know,
nowhere permanent right now

30:05.794 --> 30:07.671
but I stay in
the shelter some nights

30:07.796 --> 30:11.300
and I'm 18 now so
they can't call my folks.

30:11.383 --> 30:13.703
Yeah, so I'm free, you know, I'm
living the dream, you know.

30:14.219 --> 30:16.347
Hey, I got a Section 8
apartment.

30:17.222 --> 30:18.307
Really?

30:18.432 --> 30:20.267
Yeah, I'm there
with my boyfriend.

30:21.852 --> 30:23.521
I mean, if you want,
you can crash for a while.

30:23.687 --> 30:25.272
You know,
if things get real bad.

30:25.397 --> 30:26.690
No, no. That's...

30:26.773 --> 30:28.692
Are you sure?
Yeah. Yeah, you know me.

30:28.775 --> 30:30.319
I don't like asking
for favors from anybody.

30:30.444 --> 30:31.987
Hey, you're not asking,
I'm offering.

30:32.154 --> 30:34.657
Oh, that's cool, Allie.
That's really great.

30:35.824 --> 30:37.742
You stop by the park sometime

30:37.868 --> 30:39.870
and hook me up with some
leftovers, all right?

30:39.995 --> 30:42.623
Okay, Trish, I will.
I will.

30:52.216 --> 30:54.259
You like kids, Bennett?

30:54.385 --> 30:56.470
Sure.
They're all right. You?

30:56.554 --> 30:58.722
Of course.
Who doesn't like kids?

31:09.358 --> 31:10.775
Listen up.

31:11.569 --> 31:14.988
You are about to enter a
federal correctional facility.

31:15.489 --> 31:18.909
You will be held to the same
expectations as the inmates.

31:19.076 --> 31:23.330
That means no talking, no chewing
gum, no acting disrespectful,

31:23.497 --> 31:24.789
you understand me?

31:24.915 --> 31:26.750
All right, is that it?
Let's go.

31:26.833 --> 31:28.194
BUS DRIVER:
Wait, there's one more.

31:34.007 --> 31:35.926
These kids are all
delinquents, right?

31:36.051 --> 31:37.553
Yeah, I thought so.

31:37.636 --> 31:39.555
I wonder what she did.

31:44.101 --> 31:45.852
Here she comes.

31:45.936 --> 31:47.979
Okay, I'm on it.
Yo, Doggett!

31:48.105 --> 31:50.691
Hey, hold up.
Yeah.

31:51.942 --> 31:54.945
Listen, I heard you cured Janae's knee.
Is that true?

31:55.112 --> 31:57.592
Yes, yeah. I am just a simple
woman, doing the work of the Lord.

31:57.615 --> 32:00.825
I see. Look, that's really...
It's incredible.

32:01.952 --> 32:03.370
Do you think you could help me?

32:03.454 --> 32:04.622
Well, what's hurting?

32:04.747 --> 32:07.165
My mind,
I have unclean thoughts.

32:08.959 --> 32:10.544
Lesbian content.

32:11.128 --> 32:12.337
What do you think?
Do you think you could help?

32:12.463 --> 32:13.422
You know,
you're messin' with me

32:13.505 --> 32:15.025
and I don't mess
with my Lord that way.

32:15.048 --> 32:16.688
Sorry but... No, I'm not.
I'm not, I swear.

32:16.925 --> 32:18.469
I mean, since...

32:18.594 --> 32:22.306
Look, since I had Little Boo, I
found these feelings of mothering,

32:22.473 --> 32:23.557
deep inside me.

32:23.890 --> 32:25.643
I think someday I
might wanna have a kid.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.102
But I don't want to do it
with another woman,

32:27.227 --> 32:29.480
'cause those kids,
they always turn out gay.

32:29.896 --> 32:33.024
And being queer,
that is really hard life.

32:33.150 --> 32:34.151
Mm-hmm.

32:34.234 --> 32:39.114
The cycle of terror ends now, with me.
I swear.

32:39.573 --> 32:40.907
You're serious?
Mm-hmm.

32:41.032 --> 32:43.494
You ready to take
on the Lord's grace?

32:44.953 --> 32:45.996
Kneel before me.

32:47.164 --> 32:49.040
Bring the dog, please.

32:49.374 --> 32:52.544
Right here before me
we have a sinner, Lord,

32:52.670 --> 32:55.422
who's ready to
accept you into her heart.

32:55.506 --> 32:59.843
Cleanse her heart of sickness
and her mind of filth.

33:00.218 --> 33:01.386
Yeah, I'm still seeing filth.

33:01.512 --> 33:04.139
Concentrate!
Dear Lord, I ask you today

33:04.222 --> 33:08.811
to help this sinner find a life
of family, a life of rightness.

33:08.935 --> 33:12.606
We're gonna make her pure
and whole and good again.

33:12.690 --> 33:16.901
As I lay my hand on this child's
head, right here, right now,

33:17.027 --> 33:20.489
I ask you Lord, help her.
Help her become...

33:21.323 --> 33:23.867
...gay, Lord, no more!

33:27.705 --> 33:29.790
I don't feel any different.

33:31.041 --> 33:35.420
Wait, let me try picturing the
2008 US Women's Soccer Team,

33:35.546 --> 33:36.714
that usually works.

33:36.839 --> 33:37.840
Okay.

33:41.385 --> 33:42.969
Kick it, kick it!

33:43.762 --> 33:47.808
Wait. Wait, I don't feel anything.
I don't feel anything!

33:47.891 --> 33:50.101
It worked. I don't like this.
Change me back!

33:50.227 --> 33:52.437
Don't leave me here like this.
Don't leave me straight!

33:52.563 --> 33:53.731
Thank you. Thank you.

33:53.856 --> 33:55.023
Change me back!

33:56.900 --> 33:58.068
Hey, Trish.

33:58.235 --> 33:59.403
Hey, what's up?

34:01.405 --> 34:03.490
Yo, Nichols,
I know you're probably not

34:03.615 --> 34:05.701
supposed to talk to
me and everything,

34:05.784 --> 34:09.913
but could you do me a solid and
tell Red I'm gonna make it right?

34:10.414 --> 34:11.456
Yeah, okay.

34:11.581 --> 34:15.878
You tell her that
we're gonna be square

34:15.960 --> 34:18.505
'cause I'm gonna
figure something out.

34:22.426 --> 34:23.886
Jesus Christ.

34:24.135 --> 34:26.638
Ladies! Time to report
to your work details.

34:27.723 --> 34:29.266
Those of you
with prior approval

34:29.391 --> 34:30.934
can make your way
to the front entrance

34:31.016 --> 34:32.518
to meet today's special guests.

34:32.686 --> 34:34.688
Showtime. Am I right?
Yeah, yeah!

34:34.772 --> 34:36.313
PORNSTACHE: Hey!

34:36.607 --> 34:38.817
Walk. In orderly fashion.

34:46.491 --> 34:48.702
That's the cafeteria,
you don't wanna go up there.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.203
Stay right around here.

34:50.370 --> 34:52.996
Hey. What the fuck do
you think you're doing?

34:53.123 --> 34:55.417
I'm going to see the kids.
They said I could come.

34:55.500 --> 34:56.918
Oh, did they?

34:57.001 --> 34:59.797
Yeah. Plus, I get out
of work, so it's cool.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.257
You can't even keep
your fucking eyes open.

35:02.340 --> 35:03.884
It's my fault for trusting
a stupid fucking

35:03.967 --> 35:06.052
junkie moron idiot.
What are you doing?

35:06.136 --> 35:07.429
Just stay in here.

35:07.512 --> 35:09.807
You don't have to go to work.
Just stay out of sight.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.809
What am I
supposed to do in here?

35:11.975 --> 35:13.351
Take a nap.

35:19.566 --> 35:21.944
I don't understand. What is
it you're trying to pay for?

35:22.068 --> 35:23.153
These headphones.

35:23.278 --> 35:24.321
Yeah, we don't sell those.

35:24.446 --> 35:26.657
But you did two years ago.

35:27.157 --> 35:30.034
I borrowed them from you,
when I didn't have the money,

35:30.160 --> 35:32.704
but I do now,
so I want to settle my debt.

35:33.288 --> 35:35.833
Let me get the manager.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.227
Listen, I told you
not to come in here.

35:56.353 --> 35:59.356
But I'm here to pay you for
something I haven't paid for yet.

35:59.523 --> 36:01.274
I owe you for
these headphones, yo.

36:01.358 --> 36:03.026
Just go.

36:03.193 --> 36:04.862
No, no. I'm no thief.
I settle my debts.

36:05.028 --> 36:06.905
Just go before I call the cops.

36:07.030 --> 36:08.782
Sam.
What?

36:08.866 --> 36:10.346
I saw her take one
of those necklaces.

36:10.408 --> 36:13.871
No, I'm gonna pay for that later, you know.
But first things first.

36:13.954 --> 36:17.207
So what do we just say, it's
$20, and we call it even?

36:17.374 --> 36:19.209
That necklace doesn't
even cost that much.

36:19.334 --> 36:21.503
Isn't for the necklace.
It's for the headphones.

36:21.586 --> 36:23.046
Sara, don't let her leave.

36:23.171 --> 36:24.631
You don't let her leave.

36:24.798 --> 36:26.591
I don't get paid enough.

36:28.301 --> 36:29.636
Hey! Where you going?

36:29.970 --> 36:31.095
Nowhere.

36:34.057 --> 36:35.350
She steal something?

36:35.475 --> 36:36.810
I'm not sure.

36:38.562 --> 36:40.063
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

36:47.946 --> 36:50.240
Inmates, say hello.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.957
What's up?

36:59.082 --> 37:01.919
What's your name? What's
your fucking name? Rebecca.

37:02.002 --> 37:05.296
Here we go. You ready to
see some Shakespeare shit?

37:05.422 --> 37:08.174
What the fuck you smiling for?
What are you, some kind of clown?

37:08.341 --> 37:09.593
What the fuck you smiling for?

37:09.718 --> 37:13.179
You think this is a joke? Do I
look like a fucking joke to you?

37:13.263 --> 37:16.433
You wouldn't make it one goddamn
night in here, you understand...

37:16.516 --> 37:19.143
"You common cry of
curs whose breath

37:19.269 --> 37:21.939
"I hate as reek
o' the rotten fens,

37:22.105 --> 37:27.110
"whose loves I prize as the
dead carcasses of unburied men

37:27.235 --> 37:29.947
"that do corrupt my air!"

37:33.450 --> 37:37.287
Thank you. And thank you.

37:37.537 --> 37:38.956
Speak up!
Rebecca!

37:39.122 --> 37:40.916
Oh? Oh!

37:40.999 --> 37:43.085
You trying to cop a fuckin'
attitude with me now?

37:43.167 --> 37:44.419
No, I just...
What?

37:44.502 --> 37:46.254
You said speak up, so...
Don't fucking play with me!

37:46.421 --> 37:47.631
Don't play with her!

37:48.423 --> 37:50.467
Why? Smarten up.
This is for real!

37:50.592 --> 37:51.676
(WHISPERING)
Goals!

37:51.802 --> 37:53.053
What, you quiet now?

37:53.136 --> 37:56.473
You don't got a joke to tell, clown?
You don't got a joke to tell?

37:56.556 --> 37:58.224
You're a fucking smoking clown.

37:58.349 --> 38:00.060
What you gonna
tell jokes and juggle?

38:00.143 --> 38:02.145
Get your hands off
my fuckin' pussy.

38:02.228 --> 38:04.314
You wanna touch it?
You wanna touch it for real?

38:04.481 --> 38:06.316
So, wassup?
You think you tough,

38:06.441 --> 38:08.318
'cause you in
a wheelchair and shit?

38:08.401 --> 38:09.402
No.

38:09.778 --> 38:11.195
Well, you know what I'm saying,

38:11.321 --> 38:13.323
ain't no wheelchair
ramps in prison, right?

38:13.448 --> 38:14.928
Ain't nobody gonna
be holding no doors

38:14.950 --> 38:16.326
open for you
and shit up in here.

38:16.451 --> 38:17.661
I don't need nobody
to hold doors for me.

38:17.786 --> 38:19.788
I can do anything
anybody else can do.

38:21.790 --> 38:23.291
My bad. That's cool.
You know what I'm sayin'?

38:23.374 --> 38:24.751
I didn't mean you
couldn't do stuff...

38:24.835 --> 38:27.337
They told me I
couldn't rob a liquor store,

38:27.754 --> 38:29.840
'cause I'm a roller.
But I showed them.

38:29.923 --> 38:31.174
Get your face down! Don't
look at me in the eye!

38:31.257 --> 38:32.676
All right, well, you know,

38:32.801 --> 38:34.886
that's not something you
need to prove to everybody.

38:35.012 --> 38:39.016
They told me I couldn't gang bang.
And now I got my own gang.

38:39.099 --> 38:43.269
Of handicapped people?
Yo, listen, that's not...

38:43.353 --> 38:45.981
You're just gonna make things
harder for yourself, man.

38:46.106 --> 38:49.109
How many of y'all is it?
Y'all just roll up on people?

38:49.317 --> 38:51.778
This isn't enough. We aren't
helping these kids enough.

38:51.862 --> 38:54.405
Are you sure?
Most of them are crying.

38:54.531 --> 38:56.533
No child left behind.

38:57.325 --> 39:00.328
Where's Tricia? I requested her.
I don't know.

39:00.745 --> 39:02.706
Find her.
It'll be good for them

39:02.873 --> 39:04.791
to get scared by
someone their own age.

39:04.875 --> 39:06.292
(CLAMORING CONTINUES)

39:08.336 --> 39:10.380
Receive the Lord!

39:11.548 --> 39:13.216
Can I get an Amen?
Amen!

39:13.299 --> 39:15.552
Can I get another Amen?
Amen! Amen!

39:21.558 --> 39:25.729
Yeah! The Lord is
speaking to me right now

39:25.812 --> 39:28.398
and he is gonna heal
you of that eczema!

39:29.232 --> 39:32.569
I can't even... This is, this is evil.
This is evil.

39:32.736 --> 39:35.238
No. This is divine
retribution.

39:36.406 --> 39:38.449
I'm gonna pee in my pants.

39:38.575 --> 39:40.410
Now when I say Jesus loves
you, you say, "Yes!"

39:40.493 --> 39:42.412
Jesus loves you!
Yes!

39:42.495 --> 39:43.914
Does Jesus love you?
Yes!

39:44.039 --> 39:45.373
Does Jesus love me?
Yes!

39:45.456 --> 39:48.418
Holy fuck! I wish we could
put this shit on YouTube.

39:48.501 --> 39:50.879
Yeah, it's funny. Hey, have
you seen Tricia Miller?

39:51.088 --> 39:54.632
Miller. Huh. No. Why?

39:54.925 --> 39:56.801
She was supposed to be on the
tour and she's not at work.

39:56.927 --> 39:58.386
I better radio in.
No, no!

39:58.469 --> 40:02.348
You know what, I did see her. She just
stepped off to go to the bathroom.

40:02.599 --> 40:05.351
I'll send her your way as
soon as she comes back. Okay.

40:05.435 --> 40:07.020
Yep! You got it.

40:07.104 --> 40:09.397
Can I get some love?
Can I hear the word love?

40:09.522 --> 40:10.565
Love!
Love!

40:12.442 --> 40:14.027
Take a look.
This is where you shower.

40:14.111 --> 40:15.946
Does this look like a nice
place to take a shower?

40:16.029 --> 40:18.281
Uh-uh. Shit, it's super
fungus all up in here.

40:18.406 --> 40:20.617
My feet be itching
ever since I got here.

40:20.700 --> 40:22.953
Itching all the livelong day.

40:25.163 --> 40:26.790
Um, hello?

40:26.957 --> 40:27.958
(CHUCKLES)

40:28.041 --> 40:31.253
Itchy feet not the only thing
you gotta worry about, right?

40:31.795 --> 40:32.796
Tell 'em, Chapman.

40:32.963 --> 40:33.964
Tell them what?

40:34.131 --> 40:36.758
Tell 'em what happens when you
drop a bar of soap in prison.

40:36.841 --> 40:39.636
You know, I don't really think
that that stereotype applies here.

40:40.303 --> 40:41.471
Oh, yes, it does.

40:42.973 --> 40:44.682
Well, okay.
But I use body wash.

40:44.808 --> 40:46.517
To molest people with?

40:46.643 --> 40:47.644
(GIRLS LAUGH)

40:47.769 --> 40:50.063
Man, this is a joke! You all
just putting on a show.

40:50.147 --> 40:52.107
Yo, keep laughing, little kid.

40:52.190 --> 40:54.442
Shut up real quick
once Chapman gets you.

40:56.360 --> 40:59.781
That's right.
Chapman a stone cold lesbian

40:59.864 --> 41:01.908
and she put you
through your paces.

41:01.992 --> 41:03.493
Why am I
the stone cold lesbian?

41:03.618 --> 41:05.120
Lesbionic.

41:06.121 --> 41:07.164
Chapman!

41:14.462 --> 41:16.131
It's for the children.

41:23.346 --> 41:24.722
Fuck. Fuck!

41:29.060 --> 41:31.229
All right, shitstain,
up and at 'em.

41:35.108 --> 41:36.400
What the fuck?

41:42.448 --> 41:45.827
Hey! Hey! Fuck!

41:53.960 --> 41:55.128
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

41:55.628 --> 41:57.380
Shit. Shit.

42:06.306 --> 42:10.060
See that fuckin' toilet? No door
on the motherfuckin' stall?

42:10.185 --> 42:11.394
That sound like fun to you?

42:11.895 --> 42:15.106
You got to use the bathroom,
everybody see.

42:15.232 --> 42:17.567
Even if it's number two.
Yeah.

42:17.692 --> 42:22.239
One, two, three,
it don't matter in prison.

42:22.530 --> 42:23.740
I don't care.

42:23.865 --> 42:25.825
You don't care?
I don't care.

42:25.950 --> 42:27.751
All right, all right,
I've had enough of this.

42:27.827 --> 42:29.579
You think this is a joke?
Do you?

42:29.704 --> 42:30.914
Yeah, kind of.

42:31.081 --> 42:36.002
How 'bout you spend the night here?
Just you and Chapman.

42:37.254 --> 42:38.546
You like that?

42:38.629 --> 42:41.383
Yeah, you get that
wet Chapman treatment.

42:42.633 --> 42:44.302
Whatever.
Whatever?

42:44.427 --> 42:45.762
Whatever!
Fuck you.

42:45.929 --> 42:48.056
All right, let's go.

42:49.099 --> 42:53.103
Not you. You stay here.
You stay here.

42:53.603 --> 42:56.480
Chapman.
Have a nice lunch.

42:57.690 --> 43:00.610
You know, I'm not even
fully like that. Ha!

43:00.735 --> 43:04.114
"Little honor to
be much believed."

43:05.573 --> 43:08.534
So what, now's the part
where you try to scare me?

43:08.910 --> 43:12.830
No. No, I really,
I don't want to scare you.

43:12.997 --> 43:16.251
But believe me,
you don't want to be in here.

43:16.459 --> 43:18.711
Don't touch me!
Dyke faggot bitch!

43:26.636 --> 43:28.679
Excuse me?
You heard me.

43:29.222 --> 43:30.473
What's your name again?

43:30.556 --> 43:32.142
Dina.
Dina.

43:33.143 --> 43:34.436
That's a pretty name.

43:36.313 --> 43:39.649
You know, I could tell you a lot of
things that would scare you, Dina.

43:39.983 --> 43:42.184
I could tell you that I'm gonna
make you my prison bitch,

43:42.319 --> 43:44.487
I could tell you that I'm gonna
make you my house mouse,

43:44.570 --> 43:47.530
that I will have sex with you even if
we don't have an emotional connection.

43:47.657 --> 43:50.118
That I'm gonna do to you what the
spring does with the cherry trees,

43:50.201 --> 43:51.953
but in a prison way.

43:52.954 --> 43:54.289
Pablo Neruda.

43:55.873 --> 43:57.500
But why bother?

43:59.294 --> 44:00.586
You're too tough, right?

44:01.171 --> 44:03.173
Yeah, I know how easy
it is to convince yourself

44:03.340 --> 44:05.342
you're something
that you're not.

44:06.176 --> 44:10.013
You could do that on the outside.
You can just keep moving.

44:10.513 --> 44:14.100
Keep yourself so busy you don't
have to face who you really are.

44:15.268 --> 44:16.269
But...

44:21.607 --> 44:22.859
...you're weak.

44:24.486 --> 44:26.070
Back the fuck off me.

44:29.699 --> 44:33.661
I'm like you, Dina.
I'm weak, too.

44:35.288 --> 44:38.249
I can't get through this
without somebody to touch,

44:38.375 --> 44:40.084
without somebody to love.

44:42.045 --> 44:43.754
Is that because
sex numbs the pain?

44:43.880 --> 44:45.631
Or is it because I'm
some evil fuck-monster?

44:45.715 --> 44:46.799
I don't know.

44:46.883 --> 44:51.012
But I do know, I was somebody
before I came in here.

44:51.971 --> 44:55.557
I was somebody with a life
that I chose for myself.

44:56.184 --> 45:01.356
And now, now it's just about getting
through the day without crying.

45:02.399 --> 45:06.486
And I'm scared.
I'm still scared.

45:08.488 --> 45:13.201
I'm scared that I'm not myself in
here, and I'm scared that I am.

45:13.743 --> 45:16.079
Other people aren't the
scariest part of prison, Dina,

45:16.746 --> 45:19.916
it's coming face-to-face
with who you really are.

45:20.750 --> 45:22.626
Because once you're
behind these walls,

45:22.752 --> 45:25.088
there's nowhere to run,
even if you could run.

45:26.172 --> 45:28.590
The truth catches up
with you in here, Dina.

45:29.884 --> 45:33.137
And it's the truth that's
gonna make you her bitch.

45:46.734 --> 45:49.487
Damn. You cold.

45:49.779 --> 45:51.448
Bitches gots to learn.

45:57.370 --> 45:59.663
All right, listen up!

46:12.760 --> 46:14.011
Oh, fuck.

46:37.410 --> 46:38.869
Hey, Doggett.

46:40.788 --> 46:42.999
I think there's a soul in the
bathroom that needs saving.

46:43.333 --> 46:44.375
Constipation?

46:44.501 --> 46:46.169
No, this girl needs a miracle.

46:51.841 --> 46:54.218
All right.
What have we learned today?

46:54.511 --> 46:56.262
Don't go to prison.
That's right.

46:56.346 --> 46:57.930
Or what happens?

46:58.097 --> 46:59.474
We'll have to
live here with you.

46:59.599 --> 47:00.933
That's right.

47:01.017 --> 47:03.060
And respect your parents,
you hear.

47:03.186 --> 47:04.728
And stay away from that bud.

47:04.854 --> 47:06.439
And clean your rooms.

47:06.897 --> 47:09.651
And don't embezzle,
or illegally download media.

47:10.151 --> 47:11.819
Uh, yeah.

47:21.037 --> 47:24.123
We know you're good kids. You're
not gonna make the same mistakes.

47:24.415 --> 47:26.256
We believe in you.
DINA: Please leave me alone!

47:26.334 --> 47:27.627
Jesus!

47:28.002 --> 47:30.042
Nobody move! Nobody move!
DINA: Get off of me! Help!

47:30.129 --> 47:33.675
Lord, I call on you right now
to make this child walk again!

47:33.841 --> 47:36.760
Make her walk again, sweet Lord.
Work through me...

47:36.886 --> 47:40.056
Hey! Hey,
get off of her! Get off her.

47:40.139 --> 47:41.765
Jesus has sent me
to help... Ow!

47:41.932 --> 47:43.059
(GRUNTS IN PAIN)

47:44.310 --> 47:47.855
Lord, they're blinding me!
I am your martyr!

47:52.360 --> 47:53.444
What's going on?

47:53.570 --> 47:54.571
All right, settle down.

47:54.904 --> 47:58.575
This is Bell. We have a situation
in the E-Dorm bathroom.

47:58.700 --> 48:01.743
Unruly inmate restrained and
in need of escort to Psych.

48:01.911 --> 48:03.079
Is this real?

48:03.246 --> 48:04.414
I am terminating the tour.

48:04.539 --> 48:06.999
I will proceed with the children
to the main entrance. Copy?

48:07.584 --> 48:10.002
Bell, this is Fischer.

48:10.086 --> 48:11.962
Copy that, but...
What?

48:12.171 --> 48:13.851
Don't bring the kids
down Corridor B, okay?

48:14.298 --> 48:15.425
What? Why?

48:15.757 --> 48:16.758
Um...

48:17.343 --> 48:19.470
We have a situation
down here, too.

48:21.556 --> 48:25.767
Back it up.
Back it up. Come on.

48:37.988 --> 48:40.782
There's a lot of touching
going on down there.

48:40.908 --> 48:42.619
Healy, now is not the time.

48:42.744 --> 48:44.454
O'NEILL: Ladies,
let's break it up.

48:45.121 --> 48:46.623
I just saw her.

48:48.832 --> 48:50.627
We all just saw her.

49:00.428 --> 49:02.972
FEMALE ON RADIO: Copy that, we
have Cellblock D on lockdown...

49:31.125 --> 49:32.543
(SOBBING)

49:37.173 --> 49:38.591
Red?

49:54.357 --> 49:58.027
It's my fault.
I turned her away.

49:58.444 --> 50:00.530
No. This is not on you.

50:00.613 --> 50:03.282
I didn't mean
she was out forever.

50:03.907 --> 50:06.076
I just wanted to
teach her a lesson.

50:10.872 --> 50:12.416
I thought she was stronger.

50:12.750 --> 50:16.379
She was. She didn't
hang herself. She OD'd.

50:16.504 --> 50:18.584
I saw her wobbling around
the cafeteria this morning.

50:20.341 --> 50:22.968
So she killed herself
a different way.

50:23.052 --> 50:25.262
I'm the one responsible.

50:25.388 --> 50:29.350
No! This isn't on you.
It's on me.

50:31.352 --> 50:34.230
I'm the one who finked to
Pornstache about Neptune.

50:35.439 --> 50:37.233
I'm the reason the drugs
are still comin' in.

50:41.404 --> 50:42.488
Why?

50:44.948 --> 50:48.327
Oh, God. I don't know.

50:49.871 --> 50:53.624
I was just mad at you
for always shitting on me.

50:53.875 --> 50:55.376
I only sent Tricia to detox

50:55.459 --> 50:57.628
because I thought they would
start an investigation.

50:57.919 --> 51:00.005
To put an end to all of this.

51:00.172 --> 51:01.591
I didn't know that.

51:04.802 --> 51:06.429
You were right to not trust me.

51:06.888 --> 51:10.600
Nicky, I trust you
more than anyone.

51:11.642 --> 51:12.976
I always have.

51:13.143 --> 51:14.936
I do now more than ever.

51:15.187 --> 51:18.524
Now? You got shit in
your ears or something?

51:18.608 --> 51:20.777
I betrayed you.

51:20.902 --> 51:22.445
I know.

51:25.448 --> 51:26.948
And that's why I trust you.

51:27.074 --> 51:28.826
Because I know you'll
do whatever it takes

51:28.950 --> 51:31.120
to make things right.
For Tricia.

51:31.454 --> 51:35.291
I was stupid to think this prison
would ever look into things.

51:36.250 --> 51:40.797
Even if they caught Pornstache
stuffing drugs down her throat,

51:40.922 --> 51:43.758
they'd do anything
to avoid a scandal.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.720
It's up to us now, Nicky.

51:48.137 --> 51:49.218
What are you talking about?

51:49.305 --> 51:51.098
You know what
I'm talking about.

51:55.311 --> 51:57.271
I'm talking about Mendez.

51:59.022 --> 52:01.150
I want that motherfucker.

52:02.151 --> 52:05.655
I want that motherfucker
taken out.

52:06.450 --> 52:17.014
