WEBVTT

00:08.142 --> 00:09.543
(Chemical Brother's
"Galvanize" plays")

00:11.345 --> 00:13.047
* Don't hold back *

00:13.081 --> 00:15.383
* 'Cause you woke in the morning
with initiative to move *

00:15.416 --> 00:17.485
*So why make it harder?
* Don't hold back *

00:17.518 --> 00:19.553
* If you think about it,
so many people do *

00:19.587 --> 00:23.124
*Be cool and look smarter
* Don't hold back *

00:23.157 --> 00:24.792
DON:
Okay, who's got the target?

00:24.825 --> 00:26.160
LIZ:
It's me. I'm on him.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.262
I'm heading south on Figueroa.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.730
Now, David,
I want you to take

00:29.763 --> 00:32.100
your next right,
then you hopscotch up ahead,

00:32.133 --> 00:33.601
and you pick up
the trail, all right?

00:33.634 --> 00:36.237
DAVID:
Copy that.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.838
*The world
* Is holdin' back *

00:37.871 --> 00:39.740
* The time has come to

00:39.773 --> 00:41.675
*The world
* Is holdin' back *

00:41.709 --> 00:42.776
* The time has come to...

00:42.810 --> 00:44.245
Subject's pulled over

00:44.278 --> 00:46.247
on Seventh--
he's getting out on foot.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.348
DON:
Colby, David,

00:47.381 --> 00:50.484
you got to tag-team him.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.124
COLBY:
I got him.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.625
He's carrying a gym bag

00:57.658 --> 00:59.760
- and headed east.
- Yeah, that puts him heading

00:59.793 --> 01:02.496
toward you, David.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.831
* Don't hold back *

01:03.864 --> 01:05.366
* If you think about it
too much *

01:05.399 --> 01:06.667
* You may stumble, trip up,
fall on your face *

01:06.700 --> 01:07.868
* Don't hold back *

01:07.901 --> 01:09.237
* You think
it's time you get up *

01:09.270 --> 01:10.771
* Crunch time, like a sit-up

01:10.804 --> 01:11.839
*Come on, keep pace
* Don't hold back *

01:11.872 --> 01:14.108
He's crossed over
to the south side of the street.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.844
DAVID:
Almost at Seventh.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.147
I should have visual
any second now.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.151
Damn, that was close.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.017
What? David, he make you?

01:24.051 --> 01:26.220
- No, I don't think so.
- Just tell them

01:26.254 --> 01:29.123
to stay back, because if Asan
realizes that we're on to him,

01:29.157 --> 01:30.658
then the whole structure of
this terror cell will change.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.326
Charlie, they know
what they're doing.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.327
I spent days on this

01:33.361 --> 01:34.695
working with what little
we have, so please...

01:34.728 --> 01:35.496
Guys, keep your distance,

01:35.529 --> 01:39.267
- all right?
- All right, gotcha.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.902
He just turned into one
of the produce warehouses.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.204
DAVID:
Copy that.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.306
I'll circle around back.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.383
I don't see him.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.151
Don, we've lost visual.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.320
This guy's the only link,
the only link we have

01:59.353 --> 02:00.321
to the rest of these terrorists.

02:00.354 --> 02:00.888
Charlie,
I know that.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.556
David, you got him?

02:02.590 --> 02:03.857
I just picked him up.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.593
He's at the north end,

02:05.626 --> 02:06.594
headed toward the cold storage.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.762
He still has the gym bag.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.265
Why don't you watch
where the hell you're going!

02:11.299 --> 02:12.433
Watch where I'm going?

02:12.466 --> 02:13.301
- You walked right into me!
- What are you, an idiot?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.669
I'm pushing a truckload
of vegetables.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.372
How hard is it
to see me coming?

02:19.673 --> 02:21.509
Don, we might have a problem.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.611
(thudding, grunting)

02:23.644 --> 02:24.945
This is getting out of hand.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.480
Hold your position.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.581
Just hold your position.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.584
Freeze!

02:30.618 --> 02:31.785
Drop that crowbar.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.787
Put it down.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.589
Put it down!

02:44.832 --> 02:47.968
This is a lot of cash, huh?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.803
Where were you going
with all this?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.705
Look, we know it
was gonna be used

02:51.739 --> 02:53.941
to pay for a terrorist
attack in L.A.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.212
COLBY: We know where the money
came from; we know

02:58.246 --> 03:00.714
you're a part of a terrorist
cell that was operating locally.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.717
You keep using that
word, "terrorist."

03:03.751 --> 03:05.319
I'm a soldier,

03:05.353 --> 03:07.521
fighting a war
America initiated.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.623
Your war against Islam.

03:09.657 --> 03:10.858
COLBY:
Come on, man.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.893
You're from Fullerton--
your name is Timothy.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.628
Kaleed Asan... is my name now.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.830
I want to know about that
attack.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.666
What are you gonna tell me
about that attack?

03:19.800 --> 03:23.771
Only that it's God's will...

03:23.804 --> 03:26.740
and you can't stop it.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.845
We get anything out of him?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.647
Don, I had no choice.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.450
- I had to take him.
- Yeah, I told you to hold.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.286
- He was gonna kill that guy.
- Right, David, the question is,

03:38.319 --> 03:41.889
how many thousands of lives
did we trade for that one.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.857
So you think the
attack is real?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.593
Oh, yeah.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.827
Let me talk to him.
I doubt

03:46.860 --> 03:48.529
you're gonna learn
anything from him.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.331
I don't know about that,
Charlie-- I'm feeling

03:50.364 --> 03:51.532
pretty persuasive
right now, okay?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.734
No. He doesn't even
know enough to help us.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.036
The structure
of a terror cell

03:56.069 --> 03:58.539
is what we call a "distributed
autonomous network."

03:58.572 --> 04:00.308
It's made up
of a number

04:00.341 --> 04:02.610
of independent parts
working collectively,

04:02.643 --> 04:04.912
but there's no
lateral communication.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.380
Think of those
huge signs

04:06.414 --> 04:07.848
at a baseball game,
where everyone

04:07.881 --> 04:09.583
in a particular section is asked

04:09.617 --> 04:10.984
to raise a card
above their head.

04:11.018 --> 04:14.555
Now, the designer of the sign
uses a blueprint to place

04:14.588 --> 04:16.056
the cards
under the individual seats.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.791
The fans don't need to know
what the message is.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.794
They just need to know
what their particular job is;

04:20.828 --> 04:22.630
in this case, raising the card.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.499
So once the message is formed,
the mission is complete.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.968
And it's the same thing with
the structure of a terror cell.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.037
Individual players only
need to know their parts,

04:30.070 --> 04:31.805
- nothing else.
- All right, Charlie, what about

04:31.839 --> 04:33.607
using more math--
you know, filling in

04:33.641 --> 04:35.643
- more of the network diagram?
- You know what?

04:35.676 --> 04:38.379
Frankly, I don't even know
if this much is correct anymore.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.948
A terror cell structure
is dynamic,

04:40.981 --> 04:42.516
and now that they know

04:42.550 --> 04:44.652
that we're on to them,
the structure

04:44.685 --> 04:47.521
of their entire organization
is likely to change.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.326
That's great.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.467
*

05:28.929 --> 05:31.699
*

05:33.667 --> 05:36.637
(speaking Arabic)

05:51.051 --> 05:53.521
Okay, listen up.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.523
We're racing the clock here.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.824
For those of you

05:56.857 --> 05:58.526
from visiting
agencies,

05:58.559 --> 06:00.060
I'm Assistant Director Wright.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.830
Agent Eppes has been handling
this since it broke,

06:02.863 --> 06:05.032
so I'm just gonna hand off
directly to him. Agent.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.467
Ten days ago,

06:06.500 --> 06:08.636
CIA operatives in Yemen
found a laptop.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.103
It had information
about the funding

06:10.137 --> 06:11.872
of a terrorist attack here,
in L.A.

06:11.905 --> 06:12.940
Now, Charlie,

06:12.973 --> 06:15.008
Professor Charles Eppes,
came up with an algorithm

06:15.042 --> 06:16.143
that identified

06:16.176 --> 06:19.413
this man as the guy who's
going to get that funding.

06:19.447 --> 06:23.451
Now, he also identified two
other possible conspirators.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.953
Now, we think they're low-level,
part of a homegrown cell

06:25.986 --> 06:27.087
operating here in L.A.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.490
American-born, but
definitely did time

06:29.523 --> 06:31.792
in those Afghani
training camps.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.894
Hopefully, Charlie will keep
making progress on his angle

06:33.927 --> 06:36.464
and we just got to get going
on ours.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.598
Okay, the threat
is real.

06:37.631 --> 06:41.435
The NSA is reporting an increase
in terrorist chatter.

06:41.469 --> 06:44.137
We've intercepted funding
and apprehended an active

06:44.171 --> 06:46.574
participant in the plot,
so we need to do anything

06:46.607 --> 06:49.209
and everything within our power
to figure out

06:49.242 --> 06:51.078
what we're up against
and stop it.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.546
Captain Adams, Army CID.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.047
How you doing?
Do you know Charlie?

06:54.081 --> 06:55.883
I may have some information
about your suspect.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.117
- What-- Asan?
- Yeah.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.986
You're aware of his time spent
in the Army?

06:59.019 --> 07:00.754
Yeah, that's where he
converted to Islam, right?

07:00.788 --> 07:02.556
There was another soldier there:
Michael Rains.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.192
He's since taken
the name Ali al Dossari.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.860
Uh, that's not a
name I came across.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.762
Well, they were
in the same unit.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.599
In fact, it was al Dossari who
convinced Asan to convert.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.534
They were given general
discharges around the same time.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.468
Wow.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.402
This guy may be the
level two connection

07:15.435 --> 07:16.537
- I'm looking for.
- You get an address?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.806
No, my information ends
at the time he was discharged.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.941
Okay, but, Captain, any
background you may have

07:20.974 --> 07:22.510
will help you with
my work, so...

07:22.543 --> 07:23.511
I've got a duplicate file.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.377
That's terrific,
thank you.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.246
By the way, Professor,
novel approach--

07:26.279 --> 07:27.948
you trying to map out

07:27.981 --> 07:29.650
the group's structure
mathematically.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.585
I wouldn't call it novel.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.721
Distributed Autonomous
Networks

07:33.754 --> 07:34.855
are a well-accepted
field of study.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.690
If you say so.

07:36.724 --> 07:39.693
I've been in antiterrorism
for ten years.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.961
I haven't found
a substitute

07:40.994 --> 07:42.696
for basic information
gathering.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.132
Well, information's
only as good

07:45.165 --> 07:46.634
as what you can
do with it.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.569
Okay, got an address
on al Dossari.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.237
Any reason we shouldn't
go right at this guy?

07:50.270 --> 07:51.705
Cell structure's
already disrupted.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.574
They know we're
on to them.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.642
DON:
All right-- hey, guys!

07:54.675 --> 07:55.643
We're gonna bring
this guy in.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.178
You want to fill them in on the
way? Absolutely.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.615
DAVID:
Ali al Dossari.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.716
FBI.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.718
(door crashing)

08:04.752 --> 08:06.654
(indistinct radio transmission)

08:13.827 --> 08:15.262
It looks clear.

08:15.295 --> 08:18.265
Yeah, he's not here.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.703
Take a look at this.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.873
He was forging Marine I.D.'s.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.542
Maybe they're going to try
to sneak on to a military base.

08:28.576 --> 08:29.810
Could be
the next target.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.279
Yeah, or maybe he was
after munitions.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.782
Tons of explosives
available on a base

08:34.815 --> 08:36.817
if you can
get to it.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.688
Sergeant Surplus--
a military surplus store.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.889
I'll alert the local bases,

08:41.922 --> 08:43.223
have them double up
on security.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.758
If we're not already too late.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.193
These guys are way ahead of us.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.232
Oh, there you are,
Charlie.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.336
What's all
this now?

08:56.369 --> 08:58.305
I'm, uh, using connections
between weighted vertices

08:58.338 --> 09:00.073
to, uh...

09:00.107 --> 09:01.709
to find a way to
link this man

09:01.742 --> 09:03.977
to the times, dates,
places and people

09:04.011 --> 09:06.680
that we've already associated
with the terror cell.

09:06.714 --> 09:07.848
I see.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.349
Having any luck?

09:09.382 --> 09:10.718
I am, actually.

09:10.751 --> 09:11.952
If I'm correct...

09:11.985 --> 09:13.854
he belongs...

09:13.887 --> 09:16.590
right... here.

09:16.624 --> 09:19.827
Is that sort of
a breakthrough?

09:19.860 --> 09:23.263
Yeah, the only downside is
I didn't find him on my own.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.998
Since when has sharing credit
been a problem for you.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.934
Since I'm sharing it
with an army captain

09:26.967 --> 09:28.936
that was more than a little
patronizing about my work.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.641
Pretty scary, isn't it?

09:33.674 --> 09:35.008
I mean the fact

09:35.042 --> 09:36.777
that there might be a terrorist
attack in Los Angeles.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.813
Well, a terrorist attack
just about anywhere is scary.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.381
No, you know
what I mean.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.383
I mean the city is so enormous.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.753
A lot of, uh...
vulnerable targets.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.688
(phone rings)

09:49.957 --> 09:51.692
Hey, I was just
about to call you.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.061
DON: Dossari is definitely
connected to this.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.863
Yeah, that's
what I was gonna tell you.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.230
Adams beat you to it.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.866
I mean they found evidence
in Dossari's apartment

09:58.899 --> 09:59.800
linking him to Asan.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.869
So, I just wanted
to let you know, okay.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.103
I'll check in with you later.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.872
Hey. So, the clerk at the
surplus store

10:04.905 --> 10:07.007
I.D.'d al Dossari's
picture.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.376
Said he came in and bought
two sets of Marine fatigues.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.411
Full deal, boots to caps.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.379
Fake I.D.'s,

10:12.412 --> 10:14.381
uniforms-- what, these guys
can basically

10:14.414 --> 10:15.849
walk onto any base.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.117
Just got a report
from LAPD.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.952
There was a theft last night;

10:18.986 --> 10:21.989
chemical supply company
out in Alhambra.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.857
Security guard was killed
in the process.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.860
Place called RNE
Chemical Supply.

10:26.894 --> 10:27.995
COLBY:
Is it relevant?

10:28.028 --> 10:29.763
It sounds like a civilian
facility.

10:29.797 --> 10:30.597
Yeah, it is.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.800
But the two guys
who hit the place--

10:32.833 --> 10:34.267
dressed as Marines.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.337
DAVID: The owner says the
company does a lot of business

10:37.370 --> 10:39.006
with local military bases,

10:39.039 --> 10:40.808
mostly supplying
cleaning chemicals

10:40.841 --> 10:42.242
and a few medical supplies.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.077
As a result, a lot of soldiers
do pickups.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.980
Gate guard saw
the uniforms, the badge,

10:47.014 --> 10:49.149
- he opened the gate.
- We get anything on this truck?

10:49.182 --> 10:51.952
DAVID: Vehicle was stolen from a
company

10:51.985 --> 10:53.787
that provides vehicles
to movie studios.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.889
- It was a prop.
- Yeah. They don't have

10:55.923 --> 10:57.825
video cameras in
the chemical storage area

10:57.858 --> 10:58.926
these guys got into,

10:58.959 --> 11:01.161
but you can see
them coming out

11:01.194 --> 11:02.730
right about here.

11:02.763 --> 11:03.997
Guard started to question

11:04.031 --> 11:05.799
their paperwork
or, um...

11:05.833 --> 11:07.267
they didn't have any.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.773
Whole thing took less
than six minutes.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.908
They knew exactly
what they were after.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.244
Chemical called MPDC.
It stands for

11:17.277 --> 11:19.713
methylphosphonyl dichloride.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.281
- Is that an explosive?
- It's a lot worse than that.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.416
It's the major component
in the deadly poison

11:23.450 --> 11:25.452
sarin.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.586
But it's only a component.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.789
Yeah, it has to be mixed with
several other chemicals,

11:28.822 --> 11:30.290
most of them common,
but, um, it's one

11:30.323 --> 11:32.092
that's kind of hard to get
your hands on--

11:32.125 --> 11:33.894
trimethyl...

11:33.927 --> 11:35.262
phosphor-something

11:35.295 --> 11:36.897
Will you run a check on that?

11:36.930 --> 11:38.966
I did-- turns out
three weeks ago,

11:38.999 --> 11:40.100
60 gallons of it
went missing

11:40.133 --> 11:42.903
from a train yard
in Colton.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.137
Oh, my God.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.939
They got everything they need
to make sarin.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.475
Yeah, and enough of it
to poison half the city.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.786
WOMAN: Sarin-- you picked one of
my favorites.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.387
LIZ:
I'm sorry-- your favorites?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.355
CHARLIE: Professor Osaki's an
organic chemist

12:02.389 --> 12:04.357
with a different appreciation
than you or me.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.425
Admittedly.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.795
You see, sarin
is an efficient,

12:07.828 --> 12:09.529
elegantly-structured molecule

12:09.562 --> 12:12.132
that does precisely
what it was designed to do.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.867
Yeah, what's that?

12:13.901 --> 12:15.168
Kill.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.939
It's a nerve agent,

12:18.972 --> 12:20.507
an extremely volatile one,
to boot.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.209
It evaporates quickly.
It becomes a vapor.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.344
So people breathe it,
they're affected.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.979
If they breathe it or ingest it,

12:26.013 --> 12:29.216
or if comes into contact with
their skin or eyes...

12:29.249 --> 12:31.018
So what do we look for?
What are the warning signs?

12:31.051 --> 12:32.019
Wouldn't be
as effective

12:32.052 --> 12:33.286
if there were warning signs.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.791
There's no odor, taste or color.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.159
For the most part,

12:39.192 --> 12:42.830
the sudden symptoms are
the only indication of exposure.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.332
All right, so let me ask you
this: if you had the components,

12:45.365 --> 12:47.000
how difficult is it
to manufacture?

12:47.034 --> 12:49.136
It definitely
requires some skill,

12:49.169 --> 12:51.038
but most of the grad students
here could do it.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.240
And an important
aspect of that--

12:53.273 --> 12:56.076
sarin has a short shelf life--
a few days--

12:56.109 --> 12:58.511
so it's usually kept in
its binary components.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.347
Meaning, once it's mixed...

13:00.380 --> 13:02.115
Once it's mixed,
it's time to use it.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.988
CHARLIE: Hey, Dad, the
population density studies,

13:08.021 --> 13:10.057
the maps, the stuff from when
you were a city planner,

13:10.090 --> 13:12.893
all the traffic flow diagrams,
where is all that stuff?

13:12.926 --> 13:15.362
- I left it in the garage...
- Oh, I keep it, uh, handy.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.529
You took it?

13:16.563 --> 13:18.098
- Yeah, it's right here.
- Oh, okay.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.901
Ever since you've been working
with your brother,

13:20.934 --> 13:22.369
this stuff has had
almost as much use

13:22.402 --> 13:24.004
- as when I was working.
- Thank you.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.106
So what's happened?

13:26.139 --> 13:28.876
You come up with some
other breakthrough?

13:28.909 --> 13:30.310
Yeah, the attack we're
worried about,

13:30.343 --> 13:31.378
it could be sarin.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.046
Sarin? Wow.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.382
Yeah, the FBI's
putting together

13:35.415 --> 13:37.150
a list of potential targets.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.052
I'm going to use
a threat analysis to see

13:39.086 --> 13:41.254
if I can determine
which is the most likely target.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.223
Well, if it's a gas attack,

13:43.256 --> 13:46.393
they'd have to through some
enclosed venue, wouldn't they?

13:46.426 --> 13:49.096
I mean, like the subway
or, um, shopping malls.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.264
Yeah, maybe.

13:51.298 --> 13:54.234
The thing is, these guys
potentially have a lot of sarin,

13:54.267 --> 13:56.136
they don't have
a lot of operatives.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.204
So the question is,

13:57.237 --> 13:58.338
how can a couple of guys
distribute a lot of sarin?

13:58.371 --> 14:00.273
Exactly.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.313
So, assuming they want
a high casualty count

14:06.346 --> 14:09.049
with a more pinpointed
application of sarin...

14:09.082 --> 14:12.352
Maybe I can mark off some
possible targets on this map.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.256
Maybe I could come up
with something.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.894
DAVID:
County Health sent

14:20.928 --> 14:22.495
an alert to area
hospitals advising

14:22.529 --> 14:24.164
to stock up on sarin
antidote, right?

14:24.197 --> 14:26.033
Yeah, let's hope they
don't need to use it.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.267
That's just it,
they already have.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.136
The emergency room at
Good Samaritan admitted

14:29.169 --> 14:30.437
two patients about
an hour ago--

14:30.470 --> 14:32.672
both confirmed cases
of sarin poisoning.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.474
All right,
but there's only two?

14:34.507 --> 14:36.209
What, two's not enough
for you?

14:36.243 --> 14:37.210
Think about it:
If this was an attack,

14:37.244 --> 14:39.412
it'd probably be more
than two victims, right?

14:39.446 --> 14:40.413
It means these two

14:40.447 --> 14:41.214
probably aren't victims,
they're either mixing

14:41.248 --> 14:42.249
the chemicals or
transporting them.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.052
They're part of the plan.

14:45.085 --> 14:49.322
- FBI Agent Granger.
- Agent Sinclair.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.224
You guys awake?

14:54.394 --> 14:55.228
Can you hear me?

14:59.299 --> 15:01.268
These guys are too far gone.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.469
I'll find someone.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.471
WOMAN:
What's going on in here?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.139
You stay away from him.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.474
We're federal agents.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.077
We're conducting a terrorism
investigation, ma'am.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.411
You think my husband
and son are terrorists?

15:11.444 --> 15:13.613
They were poisoned.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.148
Someone did this to them.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.284
How? I mean, where do you think

15:17.317 --> 15:19.186
they might've come
into contact with sarin?

15:19.219 --> 15:21.288
I don't know.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.393
They haven't been
out of my sight.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.662
We were moving
into our first house.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.331
Our very own.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.665
You were moving?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.034
We were packing.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.506
My husband and son
were carrying boxes,

15:39.539 --> 15:40.974
loading them into the truck.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.043
I went outside
to help them

15:43.076 --> 15:45.512
and I found
my husband collapsed.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.680
I thought it was a heart attack.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.317
And then I saw my son, too.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.518
Whose truck were
they loading, ma'am?

15:51.551 --> 15:53.020
I don't know.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.154
I mean, it's a rental.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.256
My husband got it
last night.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.394
(helicopter hovering)

16:14.474 --> 16:18.245
So, David, man, what do
you think of Warner?

16:18.278 --> 16:20.080
What do you mean,
what do I think?

16:20.113 --> 16:22.615
You know, we've been
teamed up a couple of times.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.785
Seems like we have a pretty
good vibe going, you know?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.387
Granger, don't--
seriously.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.422
Why not, man?

16:29.456 --> 16:31.291
Warner and Don,
that's why not.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.759
There is something

16:32.792 --> 16:34.694
- definitely going on there.
- Really?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.131
Don...?

16:38.165 --> 16:40.267
What?

16:40.300 --> 16:42.269
What's going on?

16:42.302 --> 16:44.171
Nothing.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.440
The Hazmat guys
are ready to go.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.509
MAN (over radio):
Okay, stand by.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.517
What you got?

16:57.550 --> 17:00.420
(loud beeping)

17:00.453 --> 17:02.522
It's hot. That's a positive
hit on sarin.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.324
Okay, we're positive for gas.
Positive for sarin gas.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.461
DAVID:
It's safe.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.763
Spill was localized to a small
spot in the cargo area.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.832
- It's been neutralized.
- Do we know who rented it?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.402
The guy used a fake name
and a fake I.D.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.770
We have a composite artist
working on a photo.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.706
Meantime, we're pulling
prints off the truck.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.774
Pulled almost a
hundred so far.

17:21.808 --> 17:22.775
CHARLIE:
Hey, Don.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.212
What's going on?
What are you guys doing here?

17:25.245 --> 17:27.080
We finished modeling the
different attack scenarios.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.116
I think we got their target
nailed down;

17:29.149 --> 17:30.150
it's very ingenious.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.684
Take a look. What are you
talking about "we"?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.086
It's the water supply.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.787
Probability of an attack there

17:34.821 --> 17:37.490
is four times greater
than at any other target.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.492
Water supply?
Sarin is a gas, right?

17:39.526 --> 17:42.095
It can be, but it
starts off as a liquid

17:42.129 --> 17:43.596
that completely
dissolves in water.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.465
That's why using the water
system makes perfect sense.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.100
They don't have to spread
the poison themselves.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.136
The city distribution
will do the work for them.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.603
Let me talk to you a second.

17:50.637 --> 17:53.273
Yeah. What's up?

17:53.306 --> 17:55.108
What's going on?
What's he doing here?

17:55.142 --> 17:56.443
Who, Dad?

17:56.476 --> 17:58.278
Yeah.
He's helping me.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.113
He's been invaluable, actually.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.781
No, no, no, Charlie, you can't
do this.

18:01.814 --> 18:02.081
I can't?

18:02.115 --> 18:03.850
Why not?

18:03.883 --> 18:06.286
Because, A: it's dangerous,
B: people have been poisoned.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.421
I mean, what are you
talking about "why not?"

18:08.455 --> 18:10.223
You don't seem too worried
that I'm involved.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.458
Of course I'm worried
you're involved.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.692
Agent Eppes,
I think we got it!

18:17.730 --> 18:19.499
Print from the glove box matches

18:19.532 --> 18:20.833
a print on file with Customs.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.136
Josef Haliz,

18:23.170 --> 18:24.737
Algerian National.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.439
Homeland's already got
a whole file on him.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.493
(door opens)

18:48.361 --> 18:49.729
Hold your fire!

18:50.863 --> 18:52.232
Hold your fire!

18:53.266 --> 18:55.134
I want these guys alive.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.207
Let's go, back up.
Back up.

19:02.609 --> 19:03.810
Need eyes and ears here.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.578
Somebody's got to get me
eyes and ears in there.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.214
(over radio):
Roger that. B Team, go.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.892
(men speaking Arabic)

19:22.729 --> 19:25.232
I hear talking; it's
more than one person.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.233
What are they saying?

19:26.266 --> 19:28.535
It's in Arabic.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.404
Agent Eppes,
we have a video.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.808
(speaking Arabic)

19:35.842 --> 19:37.777
It's a lab.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.912
They're set up
for mixing sarin.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.982
DAVID: They're still talking, I
can't make it out, Don.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.684
Oh, they're praying.
Colby, get out of there.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.520
Let's go, everybody, move in.
Move, move, move, move!

19:47.554 --> 19:48.921
MAN:
Go, go, go.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.760
Federal agents. Don't move.

19:56.596 --> 19:57.364
(man choking)

19:57.397 --> 19:58.265
They've released a vial of
sarin.

19:58.298 --> 20:01.568
- Evacuate! Go! Go!
- Move! Move out!

20:03.002 --> 20:04.604
Damn it, we better
lock this place down.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.339
Get out of here!
We've got to evacuate!

20:06.373 --> 20:07.407
Let's go! Back down!

20:07.440 --> 20:09.409
Let's go, let's go!
Lock down this neighborhood.

20:17.484 --> 20:20.787
(siren blaring,
indistinct radio communications)

20:23.956 --> 20:26.526
It's done-- the chemicals
are gone, all of them.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.895
At the very least, they've been
making sample batches.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.963
Worst case, the sarin's
been fully weaponized.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.632
Sarin degrades quickly,
so once it's been mixed,

20:32.665 --> 20:34.534
they'd only have a few days
to use it.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.702
Clock just started
ticking faster.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.604
Yeah, you know what?
We better get going

20:37.637 --> 20:39.272
- on securing that water supply.
- Yeah.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.773
Wait a minute. How do we know
the water's their target?

20:40.807 --> 20:42.409
Because my math says so.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.576
(sighs)

20:43.610 --> 20:45.912
Is it really smart
to put all our eggs

20:45.945 --> 20:47.480
in one basket based on math?

20:47.514 --> 20:49.048
Yeah, if he says so, it is.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.718
House is clear,
but we found these.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.985
Charlie,
check it out.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.954
Dilution tables--
they were

20:54.987 --> 20:57.023
calculating how much sarin
they'd need to toxify

20:57.056 --> 20:58.024
a large body of water.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.427
We got to tell people
not to drink the water.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.428
It's not just
drinking the water.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.629
It's any contact
with it, okay?

21:02.662 --> 21:03.830
It's a bath, it's a shower.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.632
Even mist blowing off

21:05.665 --> 21:06.933
a sprinkler
could be deadly.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.368
Then we got to
find the sarin now.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.736
Yeah.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.070
These guys certainly aren't
going to be telling us

21:11.103 --> 21:12.439
where it is now.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.506
Well, they
didn't know.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.375
Compartmentalized cells,
remember?

21:15.408 --> 21:16.409
Right, right, okay, okay.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.978
Their job was to mix
the sarin and deliver it.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.780
It's someone else's job
to use it.

21:20.813 --> 21:21.748
Right. I know.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.815
We keep going after
these low-level guys.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.384
We got to find out
who's running the show, right?

21:24.417 --> 21:25.385
We got two players.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.218
We got two pieces of the puzzle.

21:26.252 --> 21:27.387
You just get me
information on them,

21:27.420 --> 21:31.023
we'll be closer to figuring
out who the mastermind is.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.489
Ah! There you
are, Charlie.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.824
I didn't know
you were out here.

22:04.857 --> 22:08.060
So, uh, where are we?

22:08.094 --> 22:09.562
Oh, I see.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.364
We've I.D.'d two more
terrorists, huh?

22:11.398 --> 22:12.665
How do they, uh, fit in?

22:12.699 --> 22:14.601
- I don't know yet.
- All the same,

22:14.634 --> 22:15.868
I've been, uh,
putting more thought

22:15.902 --> 22:17.136
into the actual poisoning,
you know?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.372
I mean, to exactly
how they would, uh,

22:19.406 --> 22:21.474
be able to introduce the
sarin into the water supply,

22:21.508 --> 22:22.575
and the problem is, Charlie,

22:22.609 --> 22:24.944
the targets, like the reservoirs
and the aqueducts--

22:24.977 --> 22:26.446
they're just too big.

22:26.479 --> 22:27.614
I mean, I'd have to
think that a poison,

22:27.647 --> 22:29.015
even as potent
as sarin

22:29.048 --> 22:31.350
would just... too diluted
to do any damage.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.754
Wouldn't it?

22:34.787 --> 22:36.889
Charlie, am I
boring you?

22:38.825 --> 22:42.161
Don doesn't want you helping me
out anymore, Dad.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.530
What are you talking about?

22:43.563 --> 22:44.764
Doesn't want
you involved.

22:44.797 --> 22:47.099
He feels like this whole thing
could get really dangerous.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.468
Oh, come on,
that's ridiculous.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.570
How could it be
any more dangerous for me

22:50.603 --> 22:51.871
than it is for you?

22:51.904 --> 22:53.973
Just telling you
what he told me.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.055
The, uh, mayor's office
just received a list

23:09.088 --> 23:10.757
of demands from
the terrorists.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.091
They think
it's authentic?

23:12.124 --> 23:13.560
Yeah, afraid so.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.428
The demands are
mostly political.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.897
They want the release of eight
suspected terrorists being held

23:17.930 --> 23:19.832
at Gitmo, removal
of American troops

23:19.866 --> 23:20.867
from all Muslim nations,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.636
as well as millions
of dollars in reparations.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.872
These guys have to know we don't
negotiate with terrorists.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.540
Which means they're
still going to do it.

23:27.574 --> 23:28.541
They'll still strike.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.510
Hey... hey, I
think I got it.

23:30.543 --> 23:31.644
You got what?

23:31.678 --> 23:32.945
I cracked the cell structure.

23:32.979 --> 23:34.481
The dead chemists,

23:34.514 --> 23:36.148
the addition of al Dossari, the
Algerian--

23:36.182 --> 23:37.750
those were actually
all the pieces I needed.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.486
Charlie, you able
to fill it all in?

23:39.519 --> 23:42.121
Not all of it,
but I know who's on top.

23:42.154 --> 23:44.457
Sharif al Maliki,
who's a known terrorist.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.225
You guys should have
him in your files.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.494
Wait a minute--
are you...

23:47.527 --> 23:48.928
Are you sure
you got the right guy?

23:48.961 --> 23:51.498
He's at the nexus of too many
lines of connection, okay?

23:51.531 --> 23:53.633
He's got to be the guy
who's behind this.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.235
COLBY: I spoke to the CIA,
Homeland, Customs.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.604
The more that comes in,

23:57.637 --> 23:59.472
the more it looks
like Charlie was right.

23:59.506 --> 24:00.673
Same here.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.542
Not to sound so surprised.

24:02.575 --> 24:03.610
The list of demands

24:03.643 --> 24:05.512
names eight Gitmo detainees
they want released.

24:05.545 --> 24:08.214
All eight tie directly
to Sharif al Maliki.

24:08.247 --> 24:10.517
And guess
who ran the terror camp

24:10.550 --> 24:13.052
all three
of these guys attended.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.687
COLBY:
Sharif al Maliki.

24:14.721 --> 24:15.555
Yeah, he's the sole
point of connection

24:15.588 --> 24:17.524
for at least five
of these players.

24:17.557 --> 24:18.491
Yeah, it's not him.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.826
What?

24:19.859 --> 24:21.594
He's dead.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.996
He was taken out very
quietly by a covert ops team

24:24.030 --> 24:25.565
in Northern Pakistan
four months ago.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.900
W-Wait a second, wait a second.
How do you know?

24:27.934 --> 24:29.168
Because I spoke to the NSA.

24:29.201 --> 24:32.605
No. No. His...

24:32.639 --> 24:35.074
His name was the one name
that kept coming up.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.876
It's-It's his cell.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.646
It's his operation.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.080
All right,
so where does that leave us?

24:49.055 --> 24:52.625
Hijacking.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.160
No, Charlie, that notice--
it's been up there

24:54.193 --> 24:55.294
for about six months.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.864
Remember, I told you the
individual players are isolated.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.099
How they know nothing beyond
their individual assignments.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.634
Right. So?

25:01.668 --> 25:03.302
Well, that's the strength
of a terror cell.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.304
But it also presents
a huge vulnerability.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.239
Remember the example I
gave the other night--

25:07.273 --> 25:08.675
the baseball fans
holding up cards

25:08.708 --> 25:10.042
to make a giant sign.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.310
What if someone got hold

25:11.343 --> 25:13.546
of the designer's blueprints
and made some changes?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.682
Remember, the fans don't know
what the big picture is.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.917
They only know what their
individual jobs are.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.686
Someone could take over,

25:19.719 --> 25:21.821
change the objective
of the entire mission,

25:21.854 --> 25:22.855
and no one would know.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.257
So, if Sharif had a blueprint,

25:25.291 --> 25:27.960
an actual list of names
and numbers...

25:27.994 --> 25:29.929
Anyone with access could
conceivably take control.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.263
That's it.
That's exactly it.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.834
Al Maliki's plan, the
whole terrorist cell

25:34.867 --> 25:36.769
has been hijacked.

25:45.912 --> 25:49.215
Agent Eppes, a
decision's been made.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.783
The government's going
to make a payment

25:50.817 --> 25:52.118
to the terrorists

25:52.151 --> 25:53.720
in exchange for the sarin.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.922
They'll wire four million
to a foreign account now,

25:55.955 --> 25:58.024
and another four million
when the sarin's returned.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.258
I thought
we don't

25:59.291 --> 26:01.027
deal with these kind of people.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.029
Well, none of their political
demands are being met.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.665
No prisoner releases,
no change in U.S. policy.

26:05.698 --> 26:06.933
It's called an Iraqi Ransom.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.669
Happens all the time
with abducted soldiers

26:09.702 --> 26:11.103
or journalists
in the Middle East.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.772
A middleman surfaces,

26:12.805 --> 26:14.641
says, for a fee, he can
get the hostages back.

26:14.674 --> 26:15.875
Yeah, a middleman?

26:15.908 --> 26:17.710
Everyone knows
he's one of the kidnappers,

26:17.744 --> 26:20.046
but a payment gets made,
the hostage is released.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.014
And the U.S. can maintain
its claim

26:22.048 --> 26:23.616
of not negotiating
with terrorists.

26:23.650 --> 26:24.784
I guess.

26:24.817 --> 26:25.918
I've seen it over 100 times

26:25.952 --> 26:28.154
while I was working covert ops
in Northern Pakistan.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.460
Hey, Dad,
where's Charlie?

26:34.493 --> 26:37.630
He ran out to the garage
to get a couple of files.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.732
But hold on,
I want to talk to you.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.100
No, I'm in a rush.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.034
Now, now, Charlie will be back.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.671
Now, look, you're the son,
I'm the father.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.138
Now, that's not going to change.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.339
So, until the inevitable,

26:47.373 --> 26:49.241
I'll be the one
to decide what is

26:49.275 --> 26:51.878
or isn't too dangerous for me
to be involved in, all right?

26:51.911 --> 26:53.312
It's more than just
a little condescending

26:53.345 --> 26:55.014
for you to tell Charlie
to exclude me.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.415
You're going to need
what I know.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.117
All right. A lot of that current

26:58.150 --> 26:59.819
water system was built
under my watch.

26:59.852 --> 27:00.619
I'm sorry.

27:00.653 --> 27:01.487
I don't mean
to be condescending.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.422
- That's just...
- CHARLIE: Hey, guys.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.291
Charlie, you get anywhere with
who hijacked the cell?

27:05.324 --> 27:07.426
Anyone who had access
to the blueprints for the plan.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.161
I'm thinking, like,
one of Maliki's lieutenants.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.163
Well, actually, no, no.

27:11.197 --> 27:12.865
See, by the very nature

27:12.899 --> 27:14.967
of the way
a terrorist cell is structured,

27:15.001 --> 27:16.435
everyone involved
is intentionally

27:16.468 --> 27:18.738
given a limited
perspective.

27:18.771 --> 27:21.207
You know, if a bunch of kids
are swimming in a swimming pool,

27:21.240 --> 27:23.309
and there's an adult in the
swimming pool with them,

27:23.342 --> 27:25.311
even though he's closer
to the kids,

27:25.344 --> 27:26.578
technically becoming part
of their network,

27:26.612 --> 27:29.448
he can't really see
everything that's going on,

27:29.481 --> 27:31.050
so the most
advantageous position

27:31.083 --> 27:33.185
for a lifeguard
is outside the pool.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.354
That way, he can see everything
that's happening.

27:35.387 --> 27:38.725
So, it seems to me
that whoever hijacked this plan

27:38.758 --> 27:40.426
had to have had
the wider perspective.

27:40.459 --> 27:41.861
Right, someone outside the cell.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.229
ALAN: From whatever I've read

27:43.262 --> 27:45.998
about terrorist groups,
the, uh, the leaders--

27:46.032 --> 27:47.333
they insulate themselves.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.168
So, who?

27:49.201 --> 27:51.203
Who from the
outside world

27:51.237 --> 27:53.372
had contact
with Sharif al Maliki?

27:53.405 --> 27:55.407
I got it. I got to go...

28:02.448 --> 28:04.717
So, you were on the squad
that did Maliki?

28:04.751 --> 28:05.451
What was that?

28:05.484 --> 28:06.886
Your team took him out?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.488
Yeah. So?

28:09.521 --> 28:12.124
Yeah, so you knew he was dead,
but you just, what?

28:12.158 --> 28:13.492
You let us waste our time.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.994
(car door closes)

28:15.027 --> 28:16.428
Eppes, covert ops
wouldn't be covert

28:16.462 --> 28:18.330
if we talked about them,
now would it?

28:18.364 --> 28:20.432
I know all about you
covert op guys

28:20.466 --> 28:23.002
with your accounts all over the
world, and I also know

28:23.035 --> 28:25.171
yours happened to have
just gotten $4 million richer.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.177
Should we go have
a little talk?

28:31.210 --> 28:34.446
Fine.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.484
DON:
So, you found Maliki's

28:38.517 --> 28:41.387
blueprints after
you took him out, right?

28:41.420 --> 28:43.422
Nice little chance to get rich.

28:43.455 --> 28:46.258
I busted my ass
helping you on this case.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.460
If I'm behind it,
why would I do that?

28:48.494 --> 28:50.296
DAVID: So we'd know the threat
was real.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.364
That's the only way
to insure there'd be a payment.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.366
Either one of you have any idea
the sacrifices I've made

28:54.400 --> 28:55.902
to help protect the people
of this country?

28:55.935 --> 28:57.770
I know how you're selling them
down the river

28:57.804 --> 28:59.005
for four million bucks,
that's what I know.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.545
I'm not making any admissions
here-- none.

29:06.578 --> 29:10.549
But... if I had done something
like this, you can bet

29:10.582 --> 29:12.384
I'd be smart enough to make sure

29:12.418 --> 29:14.954
the sarin never had a real
chance of reaching the public.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.522
DAVID:
And how

29:16.555 --> 29:17.790
would you do that, Captain?

29:17.824 --> 29:19.325
Kill off the cell responsible

29:19.358 --> 29:21.427
for putting the sarin
into the water supply.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.430
The sarin gets mixed,
delivered,

29:24.463 --> 29:26.032
but the plan never comes
to fruition.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.533
No one gets hurt.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.969
Why don't you just
relax, Eppes?

29:30.002 --> 29:31.938
Uncle Sam paid the money.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.975
Hey, Don, let me talk
to you for a minute.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.278
DON:
What's up?

29:39.311 --> 29:41.213
The sarin is gone.

29:41.247 --> 29:41.914
What?!

29:41.948 --> 29:43.049
Hazmat went to the warehouse--

29:43.082 --> 29:45.918
the address we got in exchange
for the ransom-- empty.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.854
- Nothing there.
- All right.

29:49.521 --> 29:50.456
So the sarin's not there!

29:50.489 --> 29:51.958
You're lying.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.592
- It has to be.
- You tell me how

29:53.625 --> 29:54.827
no one's gonna get hurt.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.562
Go ahead, tell me!

29:59.465 --> 30:00.799
I'm not saying another word.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.604
- How can this be?
- I've been saying for days

30:05.637 --> 30:07.907
that the terror cell
is an adaptive system.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.276
It's dynamic, the
structure changes.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.345
So somewhere along the
line, a cell mutated.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.613
We got new information
on the house

30:14.646 --> 30:15.714
where the chemists
mixed the sarin.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.917
Evidently, they weren't
the only ones living there.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.085
How many more?

30:19.118 --> 30:21.921
The neighbors said they saw
four men there yesterday.

30:21.954 --> 30:23.389
That's the mutation,
that's the change.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.623
So it doesn't matter
if the captain

30:24.656 --> 30:26.058
killed off
the sarin delivery cell,

30:26.092 --> 30:28.160
because now another one
has grown to replace it.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.528
So someone else is going to put

30:29.561 --> 30:31.163
- the sarin into the water.
- Oh, yeah.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.498
Yeah, this plan
is still moving forward.

30:43.109 --> 30:44.576
REPORTER: The Los Angeles
Mayor's Office tonight

30:44.610 --> 30:45.144
has issued

30:45.177 --> 30:47.213
an Emergency Advisory...

30:47.246 --> 30:48.380
Hey, guys, come check this out.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.316
...that the city's tap water

30:50.349 --> 30:51.517
may be contaminated.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.921
City officials have offered
no details as to the source

30:54.954 --> 30:57.189
or cause of
the possible contamination,

30:57.223 --> 30:59.258
saying only that they suspect

30:59.291 --> 31:02.194
a ruptured sewer line
may be to blame.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.429
Now, in the meantime,

31:03.462 --> 31:06.332
they've warned to avoid
any and all contact

31:06.365 --> 31:07.366
with tap water...

31:07.399 --> 31:08.400
(TV shuts off)

31:08.434 --> 31:10.202
So they're blaming
the sewer line.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.071
And half of L.A.'s
already gone to sleep.

31:12.104 --> 31:13.305
They're gonna wake up
in the morning,

31:13.339 --> 31:15.241
start brushing their teeth,
taking showers.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.309
Adams knows we got nothing
on him but the money.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.310
Yeah, foreign bank,

31:18.344 --> 31:19.311
no records.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.446
I mean, if he stays quiet,

31:20.479 --> 31:22.014
he's actually got
a shot at walking.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.449
Hey, Donny.

31:23.482 --> 31:24.550
Guys, what is going on?

31:24.583 --> 31:25.551
Charlie told me to come.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.620
I did.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.356
And this is
Professor Osaki.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.457
She's an
organic chemist.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.459
And a bit of
a sarin aficionado,

31:33.492 --> 31:35.261
I have to admit.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.396
Nothing personal, but, Charlie,
we got plenty of experts here.

31:37.429 --> 31:38.965
Donny, this is not a time

31:38.998 --> 31:40.166
to turn down help.

31:42.301 --> 31:43.435
Fine. What do you got?

31:43.469 --> 31:45.237
All right, look.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.139
Based on the sheer
quantity of water

31:47.173 --> 31:48.941
and distribution,
we think they will hit,

31:48.975 --> 31:51.210
but not until after the water
has left the treatment plant--

31:51.243 --> 31:52.945
tap into one of
the main lines

31:52.979 --> 31:54.446
somewhere else.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.315
If they narrow it
down to a single main,

31:56.348 --> 31:58.384
wouldn't that reduce the amount
of potential victims?

31:58.417 --> 31:59.451
As potent as it is,

31:59.485 --> 32:01.587
even sarin can be diluted
beyond effectiveness.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.355
By using a single water line,

32:03.389 --> 32:07.393
they can maintain toxic levels
to 15 or 20,000 homes.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.229
CHARLIE: That's over 2,500 miles
of pipe.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.697
I'm sorry, but
I can't even

32:11.730 --> 32:13.665
begin to tell you
what mile they'll hit.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.602
All right.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.340
Look, we need
those blueprints.

32:21.373 --> 32:24.276
I mean, we got to know where
this attack is gonna take place.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.480
You know what you're
asking me to do, right?

32:28.514 --> 32:29.748
Yes, I do.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.183
You want me
to incriminate myself,

32:31.217 --> 32:33.052
and I'm not so sure
I can do that.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.754
Listen to me-- tomorrow morning,
thousands of people

32:35.787 --> 32:37.389
are gonna turn
on their water.

32:37.423 --> 32:40.459
That's mothers and fathers
and kids and grandparents.

32:40.492 --> 32:41.493
I mean, come on.

32:41.527 --> 32:44.363
Captain, you've had
a long, decorated career.

32:44.396 --> 32:47.399
I mean, do you really
want to go out like this?

32:47.433 --> 32:50.336
Is this really the mark
you want to leave on the world?

33:00.412 --> 33:01.980
Okay.

33:04.083 --> 33:04.983
Okay.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.320
Got it! I got it!

33:08.354 --> 33:11.357
They're gonna tap into the main
line in Hollywood near Vine!

33:11.390 --> 33:12.624
Charlie, push in on Hollywood.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.627
All right,
the Hollywood main runs

33:15.661 --> 33:16.662
right under Argyle.

33:16.695 --> 33:17.496
CHARLIE:
Wow. The water pressure

33:17.529 --> 33:19.198
in those lines
has to be enormous.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.232
OSAKI:
They'd need a pretty

33:20.266 --> 33:21.033
substantial pump

33:21.067 --> 33:22.368
if they wanted
to inject into it.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.070
So they'll probably
need a truck,

33:24.103 --> 33:26.272
which means they'll be
easy to detect.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.339
Not if they use the tunnels.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.507
What do you mean?
What tunnels?

33:28.540 --> 33:29.475
Well, they're old--
60 or 70 years

33:29.508 --> 33:32.144
at least, left over
from the Red Car railway

33:32.178 --> 33:33.579
that used to run
all over the city.

33:33.612 --> 33:34.646
So it's near the water main?

33:34.680 --> 33:35.647
Well, they'd
have access.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.249
I was down there once.

33:37.283 --> 33:39.118
I saw a bunch of relief valves.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.719
Charlie, would you
punch in closer?

33:40.752 --> 33:42.721
Okay, now, the entrance

33:42.754 --> 33:44.256
would be about there.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.424
All right, let's roll.
Get SWAT going.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.326
Let's go.
Let's roll, let's roll.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.364
Good work, Dad.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.237
(indistinct
radio communication)

33:59.838 --> 34:01.107
This thing
starts beeping,

34:01.140 --> 34:02.674
you get your mask on, all right?

34:02.708 --> 34:04.410
You don't have to
tell me twice.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.245
All right, so the air
is clean in there.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.113
We found a fresh set

34:07.146 --> 34:09.715
of tire tracks though
leading back in.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.750
Has to be their pump truck.
Means they're already inside.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.185
All right, let's hit it.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.270
DON: Hey, guys on the left, keep
going.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.305
We're gonna go up here.
Just keep going down.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.468
Hey, Don.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.536
There are tracks in both
directions right here.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.605
Couldn't make out
enough detail, though,

35:06.638 --> 35:08.440
to tell which ones are theirs.

35:08.474 --> 35:09.675
Yeah.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.343
We got to split up.

35:11.377 --> 35:12.844
SWAT, go left,
we'll go to the right.

35:12.878 --> 35:13.779
Let's go.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.228
(clanking)

35:34.466 --> 35:36.368
(indistinct voices)

35:49.548 --> 35:50.749
MAN: All right, we're ready.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.719
FBI! Don't move!

35:53.752 --> 35:55.187
(all shouting)

35:57.589 --> 35:59.391
Don't hit the truck!
Don't hit the truck!

36:10.769 --> 36:11.737
The hose is leaking!

36:12.604 --> 36:13.972
No, no, it's just

36:14.005 --> 36:15.341
back pressure

36:15.374 --> 36:16.475
from the water main.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.276
(automatic gunfire continues)

36:17.309 --> 36:19.245
He's making a move
for the pump!

36:25.016 --> 36:27.619
All right, we got to get someone
who can cover that pump.

36:27.653 --> 36:28.854
- Make a move?
- Uh-huh.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.260
(shouting)

36:39.265 --> 36:40.699
I got the pump!
I got it!

36:41.633 --> 36:44.836
Get the door.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.305
You guys, all right?!

36:46.338 --> 36:47.439
- Anyone hit?!
- We're okay!

37:04.590 --> 37:06.492
You stopped them.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.427
If you only knew
how close it came.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.029
It wasn't just about the money.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.464
I hope you know that.

37:12.498 --> 37:13.565
There's a greater good here.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.434
Oh, yeah? How you figure that?

37:15.467 --> 37:18.437
I exposed a terror cell
hiding in Los Angeles...

37:18.470 --> 37:20.772
highlighted the vulnerability
of this city's infrastructure,

37:20.806 --> 37:22.474
made people see
the kind of danger

37:22.508 --> 37:23.675
we're really facing.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.744
Oh, I see. So, what, was this,
like, some kind of drill?

37:25.777 --> 37:27.813
End of today, we're better off
than we were yesterday, right?

37:29.515 --> 37:31.517
It's a net gain,
no way to argue that.

37:31.550 --> 37:34.686
Yeah. Okay, get him
out of here.

37:40.091 --> 37:43.629
He handed over the blueprints
to the entire cell.

37:43.662 --> 37:46.332
We're already rounding up
the rest of them.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.399
Good.

37:47.433 --> 37:48.834
You put in a good
couple of days.

37:48.867 --> 37:49.835
Night.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.269
Good night.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.541
All right, boys, good job.

37:55.574 --> 37:56.575
- Night.
- Night.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.843
LIZ:
Good night, you guys.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.778
Hey, what's up?

38:03.882 --> 38:05.851
I was thinking
about you in there.

38:05.884 --> 38:08.520
Yeah, it was pretty scary.

38:08.554 --> 38:10.556
That's not
what I mean.

38:10.589 --> 38:13.659
I mean... I couldn't deal
if something happened to you.

38:13.692 --> 38:16.462
You got my back, right?

38:16.495 --> 38:18.564
Yeah, for sure.

38:18.597 --> 38:19.565
Okay.

38:19.598 --> 38:22.534
I got yours.

38:22.568 --> 38:23.635
Coming over?

38:23.669 --> 38:25.871
Yeah, just want to check in
with Charlie and my dad.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.706
- Ah...
- Well, I'll be there later.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.375
- All right.
- All right.

38:29.408 --> 38:30.609
See you later.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.850
Night.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.620
DON: Ah, you guys are still up--
great.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.755
ALAN: Well, what'd you expect?

38:43.789 --> 38:44.756
So listen...

38:44.790 --> 38:47.025
Hey, we were
watching the news,

38:47.058 --> 38:50.796
and they said that Emergency
Services canceled the alert

38:50.829 --> 38:52.798
because the
water's safe now.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.065
Isn't it amazing--
they managed

38:54.099 --> 38:57.403
to never even mention
sarin or terrorism.

38:57.436 --> 38:58.670
Huh?
(chuckles)

38:58.704 --> 38:59.938
I guess we're supposed
to feel lucky

38:59.971 --> 39:01.573
that it ended the way it did.

39:01.607 --> 39:03.675
Yes. And that's why I came,
actually, to thank you.

39:03.709 --> 39:04.676
Thank you.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.645
Muchas gracias.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.480
Is that your way of admitting
that you were wrong?

39:08.514 --> 39:10.482
No, Dad, I wasn't wrong.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.718
I mean, look, you guys
definitely helped.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.653
I mean, and to that,
we're grateful.

39:14.686 --> 39:15.954
All right?
I mean, I'm grateful.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.989
- Grateful?
- Yeah.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.725
Grateful's good enough, then.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.126
I can sleep on grateful.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.566
What? When did this happen?

39:27.599 --> 39:30.436
This whole new attitude.

39:30.469 --> 39:33.639
New attitude is gratitude.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.707
(chuckling)

39:35.741 --> 39:36.575
(laughs)
