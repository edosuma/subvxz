00:00.001 --> 00:02.801
<i>Thanks for downloading
this Fox show.</i>

00:02.803 --> 00:05.571
<i>And don't miss all-new episodes
only on Fox.</i>

00:07.842 --> 00:09.508
MAN: Kelly Walters, 33,
worked in the mailroom.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.343
And, Mitch, it fits the pattern.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.679
No, this is different.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.682
MAN: What do you make of this?
It's wool, English.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.350
The man you're looking
for has money.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.651
But he didn't always.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.021
He also has a limp
on his right side.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.656
That's why he snagged his
coat on that door. Injury?

00:24.658 --> 00:27.026
No, medical condition
he's had his whole life.

00:27.028 --> 00:29.695
MAN: And now he wants
to make them feel his pain.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.031
Selfish son of a bitch.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.999
Don't you fall apart on me!

00:34.001 --> 00:35.167
Not now!

00:35.169 --> 00:36.368
I need this one, Mitch.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.607
I know you do, Tom.

00:56.023 --> 00:58.057
GRINDER: You send that
evidence into the lab.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.725
Have them run it
against a database

00:59.727 --> 01:01.727
of everybody
within a ten-mile radius

01:01.729 --> 01:03.262
who might have
congenital hemiplegia.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.863
I was never here.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.198
(TV clicks off)

01:06.200 --> 01:08.233
Okay, so how does
he know any of this?

01:08.235 --> 01:09.568
Is he a detective now?
Is that...

01:09.570 --> 01:10.869
'Cause I thought
he was a lawyer.

01:10.871 --> 01:11.937
He is.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.072
He's a lawyer
who detectives call

01:13.074 --> 01:14.273
when they need help
at crime scenes.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.241
Right.
What are you not following?

01:16.243 --> 01:19.244
The whole thing? Guys, he hasn't seen
the first half of the season yet.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.280
Oh, so you have
no frame of reference.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.415
But shouldn't an audience be
able to join a show at any time?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.584
At any time. Period.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.953
Okay, so how would they even
know that know he's a lawyer?

01:27.955 --> 01:29.855
What's he supposed to do?
Enter every scene saying,

01:29.857 --> 01:31.457
(lower register):
"I'm Mitch, and I'm a lawyer,

01:31.459 --> 01:33.292
and I'll stop at nothing
to grind for justice"?

01:33.294 --> 01:34.960
No, not every scene.
And not in that voice.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.628
Can you imagine
if I walked around saying,

01:36.630 --> 01:37.896
(lower register):
"Hello. I'm Dean,

01:37.898 --> 01:39.198
"and I used to play
a lawyer on television,

01:39.200 --> 01:40.899
but now I live in Boise,
and I live with my brother."

01:40.901 --> 01:43.569
Oh, you live here now? I'm
just saying, it's bad writing.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.070
I don't want to be spoon-fed.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.738
Stew, if you're not
following something,

01:46.740 --> 01:49.708
feel free to watch the earlier
episodes any time you want.

01:49.710 --> 01:50.909
Thank you, Dad.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.578
It's not too late for you, Stew.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.079
You can catch up.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.481
Great.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.549
¶ ¶

02:00.087 --> 02:01.954
Thank you for getting up
early, everyone.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.289
I've actually been
sitting on some news

02:04.291 --> 02:06.331
that I am finally allowed
to talk about.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.961
Uh, for the next couple of days,

02:08.963 --> 02:11.964
a journalist
from<i> The Boise Herald</i>

02:11.966 --> 02:14.600
is gonna be following me around
for a profile they want to do...

02:14.602 --> 02:17.469
On Dean? Not... No, not on...
not on Dean.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.737
On what, then? On your dad.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.672
On me! Yeah!

02:20.674 --> 02:22.641
I am so damn proud of you.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.476
So it's on what it's like
to have a famous brother.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.278
No, it's nothing about that.
It's just about your dad.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.480
Yeah. Huh, what's
that look like?

02:28.482 --> 02:31.817
Well, uh, Ethan, it's probably
gonna look like a story

02:31.819 --> 02:35.354
about a man running a family
law firm in his hometown.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.489
"Simple Law." "Simple Law."

02:37.491 --> 02:39.491
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't see it.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.826
Yeah, I like it.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.494
"Simple Law:
The Stew Sanderson Story."

02:42.496 --> 02:44.129
The story of a man.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.131
A simple man.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.866
And his simple law.

02:47.868 --> 02:51.803
Fighting for local,
um, neighborhood...

02:51.805 --> 02:53.772
uh...

02:53.774 --> 02:55.007
Eh, I lost it.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.176
Anyway, I-I'm sure
there's a story there.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.677
And I look forward
to reading it.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.379
Thank you, Dean.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.016
Hey, excuse me.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.517
Uh, that's my space.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.985
It's reserved.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.621
Sorry, be out of your way
in a second.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.326
Dean.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.661
Not right now.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.129
STEWART:
Dean, this is not a big deal.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.897
Tell me you're not gonna
freak out about this.

03:18.899 --> 03:19.898
The writer is coming today.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.533
You do not need
to freak out about this.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.869
Didn't mean to take
your spot, brother.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.871
(engine starts)

03:25.873 --> 03:29.107
But you did... brother.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.744
I can't back up unless you move.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.866
Uh-huh.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.682
You back up.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.717
So it's not about Dean at all?

03:38.719 --> 03:40.052
I don't know.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.387
The story hasn't
shown itself yet.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.689
Well, when it does,

03:43.691 --> 03:44.990
it's gonna involve Dean,
I promise you that.

03:44.992 --> 03:48.060
Guys, let's just treat this
like a normal day.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.028
I like to start things off
with a staff meeting, Neal.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.030
Inject a little energy,
get the ball rolling for...

03:52.032 --> 03:54.900
I'm sorry, before we do that,
could we just maybe go over

03:54.902 --> 03:56.768
the assigned parking policies?

03:56.770 --> 03:58.704
Because I feel like
there's been some confusion.

03:58.706 --> 03:59.871
You know, Dean,
we're gonna start

03:59.873 --> 04:01.073
with the dealership
vandalism case.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.441
Let's put the parking situation

04:02.443 --> 04:03.442
on the back burner for now.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.544
Fine. Fine.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.912
Put it on the back burner.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.247
Something on the back
burner can catch fire

04:08.249 --> 04:10.983
just as easily as something
on the front burner.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.921
Okay, uh, our client is accused

04:15.923 --> 04:17.923
of smashing SUV windows
at various dealerships.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.525
Uh, yes, uh, but because she's
an outspoken environmentalist,

04:20.527 --> 04:22.227
they think it's part
of a larger thing.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.563
What information do we
have on Tim Olyphant,

04:24.565 --> 04:25.697
and why is he here?

04:25.699 --> 04:27.099
I heard he's boning Claire

04:27.101 --> 04:28.767
on his off days
of shooting<i> New Orleans,</i>

04:28.769 --> 04:30.235
but I don't have all the facts.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.738
Well, do me a favor
and get all the facts.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.706
CLAIRE: Uh, I'm telling
you, she's innocent.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.707
I just don't know
how to prove it.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.809
All right. What else we got?

04:37.811 --> 04:40.112
STEWART: Dad, we're in the middle
of this still. DEAN SR.: Sorry.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.781
Looked to me like she was done.
No, she's not done.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.249
And neither are we.

04:44.251 --> 04:47.252
This case matters deeply
to Claire and I.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.787
And if she thinks
the client is innocent,

04:48.789 --> 04:51.790
then I will not rest
until she goes free.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.892
CLAIRE: Uh...

04:53.894 --> 04:54.993
thanks, Dean.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.299
You know, Neal, the
next step I would take

05:00.301 --> 05:01.800
is establish a concrete alibi

05:01.802 --> 05:03.969
for our clients in order
to prove reasonable doubt.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.671
Uh-huh.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.973
I don't know if you want
to write that down.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.475
Sure, we could
establish an alibi.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.811
And create probable cause,

05:12.813 --> 05:15.814
that is, if we were interested
in doing the bare minimum,

05:15.816 --> 05:19.017
but at Sanderson & Yao,

05:19.019 --> 05:20.686
we go the extra mile.

05:20.688 --> 05:24.089
We are going to solve this case.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.490
'Cause that's what we do.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.093
We-we don't actually do that.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.995
We don't solve the...
solve the case.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.330
No, lawyers don't do that.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.165
Well, maybe they should.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.466
I mean, Neal, ask yourself,

05:34.468 --> 05:36.802
does a plumber come
to your house and just say,

05:36.804 --> 05:39.137
"No, it's not the hair
that's causing the clog"?

05:39.139 --> 05:43.308
Or do they get in there
and reveal the real culprit?

05:43.310 --> 05:44.643
The second thing?

05:44.645 --> 05:48.347
The second... thing.

05:55.723 --> 05:56.955
This is exactly
what I didn't want.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.857
He's shifting the whole focus
of the story onto him.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.460
So why don't you just shift it back to you?
Well, how do I do that, honey?

06:01.462 --> 06:03.295
You know, Dean's got this whole
"find the culprit" angle.

06:03.297 --> 06:04.329
That's... that's good.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.530
That is pretty compelling.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.232
Okay, so why don't you make

06:07.234 --> 06:08.834
your whole alibi thing
more compelling?

06:08.836 --> 06:10.569
Again, it feels like
the wrong direction.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.337
Does it? Okay.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.806
Why don't you just take a
page out of Dean's book?

06:14.808 --> 06:17.042
Go in there, make it
a little dramatic,

06:17.044 --> 06:20.846
and show Neal how sexy
simple law can be.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.048
¶ ¶

06:23.050 --> 06:24.983
DEAN SR.: So how do we catch
this son of a bitch?

06:24.985 --> 06:27.052
We get inside of his head.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.687
We just need to figure out

06:28.689 --> 06:31.223
where this bastard's
gonna strike next.

06:31.225 --> 06:34.893
Or what if we strike that
and get back to basics?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.229
Did you say something, Stewart?
DEAN: Uh, come on in, bro.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.764
We're just spitballing
about strategy.

06:38.766 --> 06:43.068
What if the strategy
was no strategy at all?

06:43.070 --> 06:45.003
Come on in the room, Stew.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.405
Can't hear you
in the doorway like that.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.739
Right, sorry.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.709
Silly for me to think
that you could... hear me

06:50.711 --> 06:52.411
just right there.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.379
Uh, maybe we don't need to know

06:54.381 --> 06:56.615
where the criminal is
gonna strike next...

06:56.617 --> 07:00.552
if we have an airtight...

07:00.554 --> 07:02.287
alibi.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.261
You want me to write that down?

07:09.263 --> 07:12.097
I mean, you know, if it fits.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.932
I could write it down,
but I doubt it'll get in.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.267
Well, take it down, Neal.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.435
What was it again?

07:16.437 --> 07:18.170
Oh, man.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.273
I told you 15 times already.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.941
I was home all day. I slept in.

07:22.943 --> 07:26.611
I know, but, uh, you must have
woken up at some point, right?

07:26.613 --> 07:27.813
And done something?

07:27.815 --> 07:30.115
Or... or maybe talked
to someone?

07:30.117 --> 07:33.585
You know, you just have to
ask the right questions.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.053
Right. Right?

07:35.055 --> 07:37.389
'Cause if you ask
the right questions,

07:37.391 --> 07:39.658
you just might get
the right answers.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.826
Yeah, I get it.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.294
It's compelling, right?

07:42.296 --> 07:44.796
CLAIRE: Uh, okay, uh,
did you call anyone?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.431
Maybe we can establish
a timeline that way.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.433
Probably not. I've been locking
my phone in a drawer

07:48.435 --> 07:50.769
when I get home
so I don't look at it so much.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.804
Oh. Perfect.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.972
Dead end?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.707
Yeah, that it is, Neal.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.643
DEAN: Todd,

07:58.645 --> 07:59.778
tell me what you've learned.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.413
About what?

08:01.415 --> 08:03.849
Are you kidding? About
Timothy Olyphant and Claire.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.083
It's the only reason
we're trying to solve

08:05.085 --> 08:06.117
this stupid case.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.152
Oh, yeah, right.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.653
It's pretty serious, apparently.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.489
When he's not filming the show,

08:10.491 --> 08:12.157
he's here with her.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.526
So how many days a month
does that put him in Boise?

08:14.528 --> 08:17.095
Uh, I don't know.
I didn't do the math.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.830
Todd, do me a favor.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.699
Do the math,
and then come back to me

08:20.701 --> 08:23.034
with something that doesn't
require math. Got it.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.037
What do you think Olyphant's
role is in all of this?

08:26.039 --> 08:29.474
Um, I don't think he was
involved in all this.

08:29.476 --> 08:32.177
We don't know that he wasn't.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.045
I mean, think about it.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.882
None of these windows were
being broken before he arrived.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.450
This your first time
seeing Dean in action?

08:38.452 --> 08:39.784
I guess.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.386
Well, my advice to you

08:41.388 --> 08:43.822
is strap in, put on a helmet,

08:43.824 --> 08:46.384
and hang on to your
freaking chair.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.361
This is a brick.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.897
Brick, brick.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.899
Why would he use a brick?

08:53.901 --> 08:55.033
Well, it's one thing
you can throw

08:55.035 --> 08:56.067
that would go
through a windshield.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.703
What is he trying to tell us?

08:58.705 --> 09:01.873
A brick breaks things,

09:01.875 --> 09:03.708
but it also builds things.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.211
It's Americana, it's hard hats,

09:06.213 --> 09:08.847
it's lunch pails, it's...

09:08.849 --> 09:11.616
What else about bricks?

09:12.719 --> 09:15.086
Do you want pitches,
or are you in a zone?

09:15.088 --> 09:16.755
Zone. Got it.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.227
DEAN: <i>He's here now on weekends.</i>

09:22.229 --> 09:24.062
He's dropping her off at work,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.363
which means

09:25.365 --> 09:26.932
that they woke up together.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.567
Right.

09:28.569 --> 09:29.868
Do you think this is serious?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.102
You know, Dean, I think
it's probably just a fling.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.104
Do we have to talk about this now?
All right.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.439
You know, Neal is here.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.941
Uh, you probably want to focus
on the case.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.776
No, I-I love this.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.945
This is... Neal, what's
your take on all this?

09:39.947 --> 09:41.079
'Cause what I'm struggling with

09:41.081 --> 09:43.248
is he's basically the B-version

09:43.250 --> 09:44.382
of me, am I right?

09:44.384 --> 09:45.750
The C-version. He so is.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.253
You know, Neal,
do you know that Stewart has

09:48.255 --> 09:50.055
a 94% positive rating

09:50.057 --> 09:51.990
on BoiseLegalFinder.com?

09:55.395 --> 09:57.262
Oh, you're done?

09:57.264 --> 10:00.565
I-I thought there was gonna
be a finish to that.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.667
No, no, that was...
that was it, Neal.

10:04.438 --> 10:05.637
So, Dean, I-I'm still
curious about...

10:05.639 --> 10:07.606
Okay, I think I'm going to, uh,

10:07.608 --> 10:08.607
pack it in, everyone.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.408
I think there's, uh,

10:10.410 --> 10:12.777
a lot of simple law stuff for
me to do in the morning, so...

10:12.779 --> 10:13.912
Would you like me
to give you a hand

10:13.914 --> 10:14.913
so you can spend more time here?

10:14.915 --> 10:16.147
No, Dean, thank you.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.283
This is, uh, really something
I should do solo.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.285
So, good night, Neal.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.153
I'll see you in the morning.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.623
Please, enjoy your meal,
everybody.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.658
NEAL: Can you point me
in the direction

10:26.660 --> 10:27.759
of the nearest restroom?

10:27.761 --> 10:30.081
Down the hall to the left. Oh.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.801
I think Stew's just upset
at the direction of the article.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.737
Yeah. Yeah, no,
I think that's pretty clear.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.005
Good, good.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.973
I didn't want you to think
that his behavior

10:41.975 --> 10:43.942
had anything to do
with the meal you prepared.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.443
I didn't,

10:45.445 --> 10:47.178
but thank you so much.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.380
Yeah, sure.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.155
Honey, the piece is not about
you at all. It's about Dean.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.823
I know that, hon.
That's why I'm up here pouting.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.992
Neal's notes,
I took a picture of them

11:00.994 --> 11:02.427
while he was in the bathroom.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.529
That is so unethical, honey.

11:04.531 --> 11:05.830
I love it.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.832
The piece is all about Dean
and how delusional he is

11:07.834 --> 11:10.001
and how he makes it impossible
for you to get work done.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.336
What? Let me see.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.672
"I hardly buy the Grinder
could solve this case,

11:13.674 --> 11:15.974
let alone the dimwit
who plays him."

11:15.976 --> 11:17.909
This is a smear piece.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.379
On my brother.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.947
Yeah.

11:22.949 --> 11:26.284
No, that's what I came in here
to tell you.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.519
Right. Hmm.

11:27.521 --> 11:31.556
There is something
he does not want me to see.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.626
Uh, Dean?

11:34.628 --> 11:36.695
(sighs)

11:38.165 --> 11:40.699
What's with the, uh, headshot
of Timothy Olyphant?

11:40.701 --> 11:45.070
Oh, there's a theory he might
be involved in this somehow.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.971
That Timothy Olyphant

11:46.973 --> 11:49.374
is smashing car windows
in Boise?

11:49.376 --> 11:51.009
It's a theory, Stew.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.012
And all theories until disproven
are working theories.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.147
Okay, sure.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.917
Uh, but there is something
we need to talk to you about.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.053
It's affecting my work,
isn't it?

12:02.055 --> 12:03.722
What is?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.590
The Olyphant in the room.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.259
I got to admit, it's got me
all twisted up.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.561
I didn't...
I didn't realize that.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.096
(chuckling):
Really? 'Cause it's written

12:11.098 --> 12:12.430
all over my face.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.199
And I think it's derailed
your article.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.900
Help me catch this sumbitch.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.902
And if we bring in
this window smasher,

12:17.904 --> 12:20.371
then Claire's got to see
he's not the real deal,

12:20.373 --> 12:21.740
and it'll also put your name

12:21.742 --> 12:23.508
back in the headline
of this thing.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.744
Right. Um, well,
about-about the headline...

12:25.746 --> 12:27.412
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, though, actually,

12:27.414 --> 12:29.881
I think maybe that
is a good point.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.716
This could work. Mm-hmm.

12:31.718 --> 12:35.687
I mean, if you guys
catch this "sumbitch,"

12:35.689 --> 12:37.889
that would change
the whole story.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.125
He would have to write
something completely different.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.226
Right.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.193
DEAN: Come on, bro, I need you.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.963
We can break this thing
wide open.

12:44.965 --> 12:48.266
But it's just not gonna be easy
to catch this guy.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.802
And since when does Stew
Sanderson need it to be easy?

12:50.804 --> 12:51.803
Yeah, since when?

12:51.805 --> 12:53.605
Come on, man,
look at that board.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.440
I'm so damn close.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.582
No, uh, I totally get it.
It's...

13:04.584 --> 13:06.417
I'm the only one with an SUV,

13:06.419 --> 13:08.720
and we did this
to determine that, uh...

13:08.722 --> 13:09.788
Exactly.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.956
What did you learn about...

13:11.958 --> 13:13.324
the other thing?

13:13.326 --> 13:14.325
So we're done talking
about this?

13:14.327 --> 13:15.593
Yes, we've moved beyond this.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.897
Okay, apparently Timothy
is super into her.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.166
He's got some big date planned
for Friday night.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.634
Date. But she may not be

13:22.636 --> 13:24.869
as into him,
and we think he knows it.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.139
We're buying into this now?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.607
It's the only way to
turn the story around.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.309
We have to solve this case.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.344
He threw a brick
through Todd's windshield.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.980
Yeah, this is what
we're up against.

13:35.982 --> 13:39.117
The brick went
through Todd's windshield

13:39.119 --> 13:41.853
like a hot knife through butter.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.822
Yes, it did.
If we had a model car,

13:43.824 --> 13:45.190
why did we need to...

13:45.192 --> 13:47.992
Todd, how can you make a model

13:47.994 --> 13:50.695
if you don't know what
the model is of? Right.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.330
But sometimes don't they
have the model first and...?

13:52.332 --> 13:53.631
No, they never do that.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.833
You can quote me on that.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.434
Or not.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.837
Okay. DEAN: But what we
still don't know is:

13:58.839 --> 14:00.171
What's it mean?

14:00.173 --> 14:01.873
Well, and why we threw
the brick...

14:01.875 --> 14:03.141
Todd, shh.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.342
Okay, sorry.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.476
Uh, so what do we have here?

14:05.478 --> 14:06.978
We have a brick here,

14:06.980 --> 14:09.047
with a... with a
smiley face on it.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.548
You know, is it a calling card?

14:10.550 --> 14:11.683
A signature

14:11.685 --> 14:13.151
of some kind?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.319
And why do we sign things?

14:14.321 --> 14:15.820
Is it, uh...

14:15.822 --> 14:17.355
is it because we want credit?

14:17.357 --> 14:18.523
Credit.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.859
And we take it away from him.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.194
And we lure him into hitting
the one dealership

14:23.196 --> 14:26.397
that he hasn't hit yet,
and we get him to do it

14:26.399 --> 14:28.266
this Friday night.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.335
What?

14:30.337 --> 14:31.870
This Friday? I have plans.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.838
Cancel them. No, we got
to smoke this guy out.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.573
Oh, we use the media.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.708
STEWART: That feels like

14:36.710 --> 14:38.243
an appropriate level of action

14:38.245 --> 14:39.711
for us to take

14:39.713 --> 14:41.379
for some smashed windshields.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.882
Sure, why don't we just
call a press conference?

14:43.884 --> 14:45.850
No, no, no.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.518
Something bigger.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.921
I need to call in a favor.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.657
<i>(cheering)</i>

14:52.659 --> 14:54.993
¶ ¶

14:54.995 --> 14:56.661
And we are back.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.997
And we are here
with Dean Sanderson.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.199
Dean, it's, uh, it's
great to have you back.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.834
Uh, it's great to be
back here with you, Jimmy.

15:02.836 --> 15:04.502
Most people know
you as The Grinder.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.837
(audience whoops, cheers)
Oh, thank... thank you.

15:05.839 --> 15:07.505
Thank you. Thank you. Of course.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.173
That's very kind.

15:09.175 --> 15:12.176
Uh, yes, but you know,
um, I'm not really here

15:12.178 --> 15:13.511
to talk, uh, about<i> The Grinder,</i>

15:13.513 --> 15:15.546
because, uh, I have...
I've moved on.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.583
I'm actually working
on a-a real law case now.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.918
Right. Right. Yeah.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.586
You, what, you moved
back to your hometown

15:21.588 --> 15:22.921
to actually practice law.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.590
I need to tell you
that there is a crime wave

15:25.592 --> 15:28.760
that is currently
sweeping Boise, Idaho.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.762
One SUV window at a time.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.430
There is a woman
who was falsely accused...

15:32.432 --> 15:36.768
So he flew to Los Angeles
to go on<i> Jimmy Kimmel...</i>

15:36.770 --> 15:39.771
To smoke out the
SUV window smasher.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.105
Yeah. Oh, okay.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.441
If they had any balls at all,

15:43.443 --> 15:46.444
they wouldn't stop
until they terrorized

15:46.446 --> 15:50.448
the finest car lot
in the city of Boise.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.450
Why are you looking over there?

15:52.452 --> 15:53.785
(audience laughs)

15:53.787 --> 15:55.286
So all this to impress Claire?

15:55.288 --> 15:57.889
Well, and, uh, Kimmel
owed him a favor.

15:57.891 --> 16:01.726
Mmm, well, obviously he would
want to cash that in on this.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.227
Yeah, got it.

16:03.229 --> 16:04.896
Has Tim Olyphant ever
been on this show?

16:04.898 --> 16:07.231
Huh, Tim... Timothy Ol...

16:07.233 --> 16:08.266
No.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.600
(laughs)

16:09.602 --> 16:11.102
That's what I thought.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.136
(audience laughs)

16:12.138 --> 16:14.806
I've been invited on that show.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.641
Several times.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.310
I just had to cancel
last minute.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.645
Each time?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.947
Oh, look who's making me
feel bad about canceling.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.949
Miss Cancel-Pants herself.

16:24.951 --> 16:28.086
I'm sorry, I have to go on
this stakeout for some reason.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.154
So bring me with you.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.124
I mean...

16:33.126 --> 16:35.460
unless you don't want me around.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.462
¶ ¶

16:37.464 --> 16:39.063
(sighs)

16:42.002 --> 16:43.668
Where's Claire?
She's on her way.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.670
So she canceled
whatever plans she had?

16:45.672 --> 16:48.172
You mean her date
with Timothy Olyphant?

16:48.174 --> 16:48.973
What?

16:48.975 --> 16:49.974
Oh.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.009
She-she had a date with him.

16:51.011 --> 16:54.345
Please tell me
you did not do all of this

16:54.347 --> 16:56.614
just to get her to cancel
her date with Timothy.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.682
Please, Dean.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.652
You got to be kidding me.
She brought him?!

17:01.654 --> 17:03.855
She must have felt bad
about canceling her date.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.490
And we're certain
she had a date?

17:05.492 --> 17:06.824
Yeah, I told you, remember?

17:06.826 --> 17:08.393
And then you said
you wanted to do

17:08.395 --> 17:10.828
the stakeout tonight so
she wouldn't... Todd!

17:10.830 --> 17:11.829
What?!

17:11.831 --> 17:13.464
This is off the record, right?

17:13.466 --> 17:14.799
No, everything's fair game.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.801
Sorry that I had
to cancel that date.

17:16.803 --> 17:17.802
Oh, come on.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.137
Don't even think about that.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.039
I'm sure I'll get
those deposits back.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.341
Besides, it's nice.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.009
Being here with you.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.045
Seeing what you do.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.713
Did you know that I was once

17:28.715 --> 17:30.848
on a TNT miniseries
called<i> Stakeout?</i>

17:30.850 --> 17:32.383
No, I did not know that. Yeah.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.651
Committed pretty hard to it.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.319
Lost a bunch of weight.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.221
Lived in my car
for the whole shoot.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.222
Wow.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.857
That seems unnecessary.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.659
Yeah.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.728
So we don't even know
if this is happening tonight.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.729
Not technically, no.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.731
(scoffs)

17:46.733 --> 17:48.366
What are you writing?

17:48.368 --> 17:52.370
Uh, "Dean doesn't know
if this will happen tonight."

17:52.372 --> 17:54.405
What am I doing with my life?"

17:54.407 --> 17:55.673
What's your article about, Neal?

17:55.675 --> 17:57.708
Do you want to tell Dean,
or should I?

17:57.710 --> 17:59.844
Go for it. What's going on?

17:59.846 --> 18:01.345
It's a smear piece, Dean.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.413
He changed the whole story.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.415
He thinks what we're
doing is ridiculous,

18:04.417 --> 18:05.583
and he's writing all about it.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.385
A smear piece on Todd, huh?

18:07.387 --> 18:08.386
Has to be.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.520
I deserve it.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.755
No, Dean, a smear piece on you.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.256
He's writing all about
a delusional actor

18:12.258 --> 18:14.592
who wreaks havoc
on his brother's life.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.262
S-So you... joined
me to protect me.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.732
Yeah, I... I guess I did.

18:21.734 --> 18:25.236
Well, Neal, there's
your story right there.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.270
It is? Doesn't even matter

18:26.272 --> 18:27.705
if we catch the criminal.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.707
Doesn't? My windshield, though.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.209
No, what matters is this...

18:31.211 --> 18:34.045
A man looking out
for his brother.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.213
A simple story.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.915
"Simple Law."

18:37.917 --> 18:40.118
You know what,
who cares about the story?

18:40.120 --> 18:42.453
Write whatever you want, Neal.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.322
Good night.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.159
Well, can I at least get
a ride back to my car?

18:48.161 --> 18:49.794
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, we can do that.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.962
That'd be fair. (Car starts)

18:50.964 --> 18:52.430
Excuse me.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.631
Yo.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.632
That you, Deano?

18:54.634 --> 18:55.633
I need to back up.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.834
You need backup.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.269
CLAIRE: No, he... Hold up.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.571
Just back up.
No, I just want to move the car.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.306
I got stuff to do.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.307
My bad.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.869
Backing up. (Car starts)

19:09.816 --> 19:11.482
"And in this writer's
humble opinion,

19:11.484 --> 19:14.085
"Stewart Sanderson should be
on the Nobel Prize short list

19:14.087 --> 19:16.587
"for putting up with what
could only be described

19:16.589 --> 19:19.157
as soul-sucking."

19:19.159 --> 19:21.492
Um, "It's amazing"

19:21.494 --> 19:23.494
"he's able to get any work done

19:23.496 --> 19:25.997
"with his giant roadblock
of a brother

19:25.999 --> 19:27.865
constantly injecting himself..."

19:27.867 --> 19:29.600
You know, I think we get
the gist of this.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.469
Yeah, yeah, I think so. STEWART: I
don't need to read more, right?

19:31.471 --> 19:35.206
"But even with this deluded
actor in the way, Stew..."

19:42.649 --> 19:46.984
"Stewart Sanderson is able
to somehow keep it all together

19:46.986 --> 19:48.719
and..."

19:51.324 --> 19:53.324
"prevail...

19:53.326 --> 19:55.626
as one of the sharpest
lawyers in Boise."

19:55.628 --> 19:57.028
STEWART: I'm sorry, Dean.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.796
This guy clearly has
an ax to grind.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.798
The tears I'm shedding
are not of sadness.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.800
They are of pride.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.702
DEBBIE: Yeah, 'cause that was

20:04.704 --> 20:06.837
an amazing article on you?

20:06.839 --> 20:08.172
(sighs)
ETHAN: And you're just okay

20:08.174 --> 20:10.341
with how he lit you up
like that, Uncle Dean?

20:10.343 --> 20:14.478
E, I<i> love</i> that
he lit me up like that.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.013
And do you know why?

20:16.015 --> 20:18.216
Because there's no such
thing as bad press.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.650
You remember that.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.519
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.
Yeah.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.520
DEAN: In the meantime,

20:22.522 --> 20:23.854
we are going back

20:23.856 --> 20:27.391
to a little thing we
like to call simple law.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.827
Find an alibi,
Stew Sanderson style.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.896
To be fair, I did not
invent that style.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.364
And the SUV smasher?

20:33.366 --> 20:34.699
Yeah, what happens to him?

20:34.701 --> 20:37.034
He's still out there.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.705
But as long as we're here,
he'll be brought to justice.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.139
One way or another.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.675
Well, the picture was great.

20:44.677 --> 20:45.676
The picture is nice.
DEBBIE: Mm-hmm.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.011
I think Dean looks great in it.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.347
I'm-I'm a little blurry, but...

20:49.349 --> 20:51.349
So Todd told me
that Claire told him

20:51.351 --> 20:52.683
that she's kicking herself

20:52.685 --> 20:54.018
that she invited Timothy
Olyphant on the stakeout.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.353
I'm sure.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.355
I mean, the guy's got
no stakeout experience.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.924
He's probably talking while
she's trying to concentrate.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.927
And she's already not feeling it
so he's probably just rattled.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.462
So this whole thing
was a success.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.264
Is that what you're saying?
Oh. Yeah.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.265
They're over.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.600
¶ ¶

21:13.773 --> 21:15.940
Okay, we don't know what
kind of kiss that is.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.108
I mean, we just don't know.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.242
That could be anything.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.443
That could be a good-bye kiss.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.646
I mean, it could be a "I
never want to see you again",

21:21.648 --> 21:23.114
"and here's something to
remember me by" kiss.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.676
I mean, we just don't know.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.485
Yeah.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.890
I hate that this
keeps happening.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.592
Might be time
to get my own spot.

21:34.594 --> 21:37.628
