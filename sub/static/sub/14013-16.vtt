for another "Thanks, Daddy."

he's giving me a kidney

know when.

if anything opened.

it was about underwear.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.174
Maybe he was good
with a hairpin.

10:19.251 --> 10:20.343
What about Manattan?

10:20.419 --> 10:22.387
I think maybe our guy
used the same hairpin.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.922
What was your guy after?

10:23.990 --> 10:25.855
Feedir that thing
between his legs.

10:25.925 --> 10:28.325
He also stole
some money and jewelry.

10:29.428 --> 10:31.259
What's the present status?

10:31.664 --> 10:34.030
Guys, I'm duckir calls
from the captain.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.802
Hey, Bethune Methadone
Treatment Center?

10:40.272 --> 10:42.365
She worked there.
She taught the nurses.

10:42.441 --> 10:44.602
One of our victims
was in training there.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.167
Oh, yeah?

10:46.245 --> 10:48.304
I worked
the patient list for a week.

10:48.447 --> 10:50.506
I don't think
there's anything there.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.286
Trainee nurses are put through
every phase of the program.

10:54.353 --> 10:55.945

the methadone

11:01.594 --> 11:03.391

on the premises.

So both Vicky and Mary

in contact with...

11:19.679 --> 11:23.115
No, not all.
About 264 out of 270.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.877
If we interviewed,
like, five a day,

11:24.950 --> 11:26.941
maybe we'd catch a break
by next Christmas.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.988
Well, maybe the problem
is that we're lookir at
program junkies.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.490
Yeah. Junkies on methadone
don't need to steal.

11:32.558 --> 11:34.492
Unless they dropped out
of the program.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.289

21:30.055 --> 21:32.148
"The charges are
murder in the second degree

21:32.224 --> 21:35.625
"attempted murder
in the second degree,
assault in the first degree,

21:35.694 --> 21:37.184
and robbery in
the first degree."

21:37.262 --> 21:39.287
Your Honor,
my client pleads not guilty.

21:39.364 --> 21:41.662
At this time,
I request a 730 exam

21:41.733 --> 21:44.167
to determine Mr. Zifrirs
competency to stand trial.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.830
The People take no position,
as long as the examination

21:46.905 --> 21:48.463
is performed by
our own psychologist.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.838
Can I look forward
to such munificence

21:50.909 --> 21:52.342
on the subject of bail?

21:52.411 --> 21:54.174
The People request
bail of $200,000.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.305
Your Honor, Mr. Zifrirs
never been away

21:56.381 --> 21:59.009
from the supervision
of either his mother
or the Gasmer house.

21:59.084 --> 22:01.314
This defendant confessed
to heinous crimes.

22:01.386 --> 22:04.219
The fact that he's here
proves the supervision
was inadequate.

22:04.289 --> 22:07.281
I don't think the State's
out of line here, Ms. Green.

22:07.359 --> 22:08.951
That isn't the point,
Your Honor.

22:09.027 --> 22:11.894
Davy Zifrin would
be lost in jail.

22:11.963 --> 22:14.523
You can leave him
a trail of breadcrumbs.

22:14.599 --> 22:16.362
Bail is set at $200,000.

22:20.038 --> 22:23.633
Clin... Uh, Clinton.
Uh, Bill Clinton.

22:26.378 --> 22:28.243
Bush. George Bush.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.447
George Washington.

22:34.453 --> 22:36.648
Okay, that's good enough.

22:37.389 --> 22:40.790
Now I want you to count down
from 20 by subtracting three.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.818
For example,
20 minus three is 17.

22:44.229 --> 22:45.924
17 minus three is?

22:46.164 --> 22:50.396
Is 12, 10, 4, 1.

22:51.536 --> 22:52.730
That's easy.

22:52.904 --> 22:54.064
All right.

22:54.773 --> 22:56.673
Let's talk
about your trial.

22:57.309 --> 22:59.174
Do you know
what a trial is?

22:59.244 --> 23:01.178
I read all about trials.

23:02.147 --> 23:04.980
It's where they decide
if I did something bad.

23:05.050 --> 23:08.042
Do you know what bad thing
you're accused of doing?

23:08.787 --> 23:10.482
I killed the nurses.

23:12.357 --> 23:14.689
Do you know
what Ms. Greers job is?

23:15.994 --> 23:18.485
She's supposed to
get me out of trouble.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.655
How about
the prosecutor's job?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.831
He's supposed to
get me in trouble.

23:23.902 --> 23:24.891
[Snickering]

23:25.404 --> 23:27.770
You sound like
you went to law school.

23:28.673 --> 23:31.369
Yeah. I went there.

23:36.681 --> 23:37.773
Davy?

23:38.917 --> 23:41.249
You know
you didn't go to law school.

23:45.857 --> 23:49.156
So? You don't think
I'm smart enough?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.592
[Panting]

23:51.163 --> 23:53.131
Ted Bundy
went to law school.

23:55.534 --> 23:58.059
My tests put his IQ
at about 78.

23:58.170 --> 24:01.003
His reading and comprehension
are about fourth grade level.

24:01.072 --> 24:02.096
Is he competent?

24:02.174 --> 24:03.266
Yes.

24:03.341 --> 24:05.275
And after his
show-and-tell about the law,

24:05.343 --> 24:07.641
I can't see how Shambala Green
could argue mental defect.

24:07.712 --> 24:09.077
(Robinette)
What about the books?

24:09.147 --> 24:10.512
His fascination
with police work.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.243
How do you square that
with his crimes?

24:12.317 --> 24:14.444
Uh, you commit murder,
you get a lot of attention

24:14.519 --> 24:15.781
from the local police.

24:15.854 --> 24:18.220
I think Davy resents
being thought of as retarded.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.657
And someone like that
would do almost anything
to show how intelligent he is,

24:21.726 --> 24:23.159
especially to
authority figures.

24:23.228 --> 24:25.219
He murdered two nurses
to prove himself?

24:25.297 --> 24:26.855
It's certainly possible.

24:26.932 --> 24:29.332
Look how eager he was
to take credit for the crime.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.460
His attorney's
not so eager.

24:31.536 --> 24:32.764
An omnibus motion from Green,

24:32.838 --> 24:34.635
including one
to suppress the confession.

24:39.244 --> 24:41.144
(Stone)
A Brooklyn court
has already denied

24:41.213 --> 24:43.044
Ms. Greers motion
to suppress.

24:43.114 --> 24:44.877
The judge there
was satisfied

24:44.950 --> 24:47.418
that Mr. Zifrin
was properly Mirandized.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.681
That decision only
addressed the statement

24:49.754 --> 24:51.779
made about
the Brooklyn murder.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.890
After he made
that statement,

24:53.959 --> 24:56.985
he was left alone to stew
in an interrogation room

24:57.062 --> 24:58.495
for two-and-a-half hours

24:58.563 --> 25:00.292
before Det. Torelli returned

25:00.365 --> 25:02.094
to take his statement
about Manattan.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.431
Miranda warnings do not carry
an expiration date.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.529
Once given,
they're good for as long as
Mr. Zifrirs being questioned.

25:07.606 --> 25:10.973
According to the transcript,
after Det. Torelli returned,

25:11.042 --> 25:13.670
Davy asked him
if he needed a lawyer.

25:13.745 --> 25:16.270
Det. Torelli told him
he didn't think so.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.509
We have established
Mr. Zifrirs competency.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.642
He's fully capable of
asserting his own rights.

25:20.719 --> 25:22.084
Mr. Stone, please.

25:22.153 --> 25:25.384
Davy, when you were with,
uh, Det. Torelli in Brooklyn,

25:25.457 --> 25:27.721
did you tell him you wanted
to talk to a lawyer?

25:27.792 --> 25:30.454
No. He... he said,
"You don't need a lawyer.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.497
Not when you kill
somebody like them."

25:32.564 --> 25:35.124
"Somebody like them."
What does that mean?

25:35.767 --> 25:38.201
Mary. She was bad.

25:39.004 --> 25:40.266
She did drugs.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.171
What can I say?

25:44.543 --> 25:47.068
Davy's question should
have been a clear indication

25:47.145 --> 25:49.477
he had no idea
what was going on.

25:49.948 --> 25:52.508
His statements
to Det. Torelli are out.

25:52.617 --> 25:54.278
Your Honor,
I have other motions

25:54.352 --> 25:55.785
covering all
the statements made

25:55.854 --> 25:57.549
to detectives
Briscoe and Logan.

25:57.622 --> 25:59.681
Including those made
during a walk-through

25:59.758 --> 26:00.986
of the crime scene.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.526
Your Honor, I can assure you

26:02.594 --> 26:05.256
that the detectives
Briscoe and Logan
were acting in good faith.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.423
Put away the whip, Ben.
The pony's dead.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.660
I'm granting
Ms. Greers motions.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.059
I called the D.A. In Brooklyn,

26:12.137 --> 26:13.661
they didn't seem
all that concerned.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.172
[Snickering]
Why should they be?

26:16.241 --> 26:18.209
Torelli didn't louse
up their confession.

26:18.276 --> 26:20.403
They'll get a conviction
on Mary Davis' killing.

26:20.478 --> 26:22.070
And we'll end up
looking like amateurs

26:22.147 --> 26:23.842
because we couldn't
sink a 2-foot putt.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.110
If Davy Zifrin does time
for one of his crimes,

26:26.184 --> 26:28.015
a little crow
won't give me indigestion.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.815
Yeah, but it might be
enough to gag

26:29.888 --> 26:31.446
Vicky Hemmings' parents.

26:31.523 --> 26:34.014
If those geniuses
in Brooklyn drop the ball,

26:34.092 --> 26:36.219
I want Zifrin to end up
in a Manattan court,

26:36.294 --> 26:37.852
instead of his own bed.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.193
Uh, our best evidence
used to be his statements

26:40.265 --> 26:41.459
to Briscoe and Logan.

26:41.533 --> 26:43.057
But now the blood
on the knife

26:43.134 --> 26:45.295
is a match
and the DNA is inconclusive.

26:45.370 --> 26:47.338
Davy said
Mary Davis was a drug user.

26:47.405 --> 26:49.839
But there was nothing about it
in the police report.

26:49.908 --> 26:53.105
They did find two
empty percodan bottles
in Vicky Hemmings' apartment.

26:53.178 --> 26:54.839
Now, if both those girls
were users,

26:54.913 --> 26:57.313
and it was not
common knowledge,
how did Davy know that?

26:57.382 --> 26:59.009
I don't know.
But the way he found out

26:59.084 --> 27:01.211
could suggest another way
of connecting him to them.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.715
Her training was over.
Nobody fired her.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.692
The normal period
is three months.

27:09.761 --> 27:11.160
She was gone after two.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.695
She found
a better job.

27:12.764 --> 27:15.631
Better how?
No locks on the supply room?

27:17.969 --> 27:21.632
Okay, so she was dealing
a few pills on the side.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.372
You have the guy.

27:23.441 --> 27:24.669
What does it matter?

27:24.743 --> 27:26.472
It matters
you lied to us.

27:26.544 --> 27:28.569
Is that because you were
in business together?

27:28.647 --> 27:29.739
No.

27:29.814 --> 27:33.079
But I know what it would look
like to the licensing board.

27:33.251 --> 27:35.685
All I did was keep
my mouth shut. That's it.

27:35.754 --> 27:37.881
Long as Vicky didn't deal
out of the apartment,

27:37.956 --> 27:39.287
I didn't care.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.050
Do you know
any of her customers?

27:42.127 --> 27:43.116
No.

27:43.194 --> 27:44.627
She had a beeper.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.823
That's how
they got in touch.

27:48.733 --> 27:52.294
Except for one guy.
He called her at home.

27:52.404 --> 27:53.962
Do you know his name?

27:54.806 --> 27:57.331
Marty. Marty Lake.

28:01.646 --> 28:04.240
Marty's already facing one
count of felony possession,

28:04.315 --> 28:05.873
he's not about to
cop to any more.

28:05.950 --> 28:08.714
Maybe he'd like to trade up
to two counts of murder?

28:08.787 --> 28:10.118
And we pulled his LUDs.

28:10.188 --> 28:13.123
He wore out the buttons
calling Hemmings and Davis.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.783
You must think
I'm pretty stupid

28:14.859 --> 28:16.258
to kill a couple of nurses.

28:16.327 --> 28:18.090
Uh, it doesn't take
a college degree

28:18.163 --> 28:19.596
to sit in your chair, sir.

28:19.664 --> 28:21.757
You hear about
the golden goose?

28:21.833 --> 28:22.993
Those little eggs

28:23.068 --> 28:25.059
don't walk out of the hospital
on their own.

28:25.136 --> 28:26.433
I'm listening.

28:26.805 --> 28:27.965
The guy you're after?

28:28.039 --> 28:30.098
He turned me on
to Hemmings and Davis.

28:30.175 --> 28:31.802
He knew them
from the meth program.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.070
So did hundreds of others.

28:33.144 --> 28:34.941
If you'll let me finish.

28:35.013 --> 28:36.708
A week after
Hemmings got killed,

28:36.781 --> 28:38.373
this guy called me.

28:38.450 --> 28:41.317
He had a couple of hundred
units of script drugs to sell.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.822
Not his usual M.O.,
but the price was right.

28:46.124 --> 28:48.217
The drugs, he said,
were from the stash

28:48.293 --> 28:49.817
Hemmings kept in her crib.

28:50.829 --> 28:52.990
He did her
and he did Davis,

28:53.064 --> 28:54.497
all by himself.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.830
I could get the same story
down the hall.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.630
I'm not makir this up.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.035
[Buzzing]

29:03.341 --> 29:05.172
He tried to sell me a ring.

29:05.844 --> 29:07.436
The kind with a face it,

29:07.512 --> 29:09.207
like a cameo.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.682
He said for an extra $5,

29:11.750 --> 29:14.014
he'd give me
the finger it came with.

29:15.053 --> 29:17.044
This is one
whacked-out dude.

29:22.660 --> 29:23.684
I need a name.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.663
You'll get a name
soon as when the charges
pending against my client

29:26.731 --> 29:27.857
have been dismissed.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.695
Brooklyrs out of
my jurisdiction.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.599
I can talk to
Kings County D.A.

29:31.669 --> 29:32.795
Nah, no, no.

29:32.871 --> 29:34.839
We already knocked
on that door, thank you.

29:34.906 --> 29:36.305
The D.A. Knows this?

29:36.374 --> 29:38.137
A Det. Torelli does.

29:38.643 --> 29:41.077
First thing out of my mouth
after they booked me.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.375
But here I sit.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.884
Nothing was released
to the media

29:47.952 --> 29:49.442
about the mutilation.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.011
Only the killer
could know that.

29:51.089 --> 29:52.556
It doesn't make sense.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.285
Torelli should've
followed the lead.

29:54.359 --> 29:55.883
If this pans out,

29:55.960 --> 29:58.656
how does he explain
arresting Davy?

29:58.730 --> 30:00.630
But he got
a confession out of him.

30:00.698 --> 30:02.325
I think he knew
how to work him.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.424
The police report.

30:03.501 --> 30:06.265
Davy's sexual misconduct
charge six years ago.

30:07.438 --> 30:09.929
Arresting officer:
Patrolman Brian Torelli.

30:10.008 --> 30:11.100
According to this,

30:11.176 --> 30:13.736
it was Torelli who suggested
reducing the charge.

30:18.716 --> 30:20.183
This is a profile case.

30:20.251 --> 30:22.845
Every perp in Central Booking
is offering up leads.

30:22.921 --> 30:24.218
On our side of the river,

30:24.289 --> 30:26.018
we don't dismiss
any credible lead.

30:26.090 --> 30:27.785
Lake is a five-time loser.

30:27.892 --> 30:30.019
He's looking
at 10 years, minimum.

30:30.094 --> 30:33.154
So he hears gossip
at Central Booking
about missing fingers,

30:33.231 --> 30:36.200
then he comes up with a story
that nobody can corroborate.

30:36.267 --> 30:37.928
For all we know,
he's setting up

30:38.002 --> 30:39.765
some poor slob
that stiffed him.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.897
That'd make two people
who've been set up.

30:41.973 --> 30:43.497
That's a serious charge, Ben.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.237
And putting an innocent man
in jail isn't?

30:46.311 --> 30:48.404
Why did you pick
him up in the first place?

30:48.479 --> 30:49.741
You had no evidence.

30:49.814 --> 30:52.009
His alibi stunk.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.242
He knew Mary Davis,

30:54.319 --> 30:55.616
he had priors.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.587
I had plenty of reason
to bring him in.

30:57.655 --> 30:59.520
So you took him
for a heart-to-heart

30:59.591 --> 31:01.252
with his old friend
Officer Torelli.

31:01.326 --> 31:02.691
How long did it take you

31:02.760 --> 31:04.091
to coach him
for his confession?

31:04.162 --> 31:06.494
What the hell
do you know about this, huh?

31:07.131 --> 31:08.689
The man is a ticking bomb.

31:08.766 --> 31:10.563
You didn't think so
six years ago.

31:12.837 --> 31:15.670
I felt sorry for him, okay?
My fault.

31:16.107 --> 31:18.769
Maybe the nurses
would still be alive today.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.778
Frank, I want you
to give Marty Lake

31:21.846 --> 31:23.905
a deal in return
for his testimony.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.979
My chief investigator tells me
Lake has nothing to say,

31:27.051 --> 31:29.246
why should I let
a known drug dealer go free?

31:29.320 --> 31:32.255
We both know eventually
he'll cut a deal
to avoid trial.

31:32.323 --> 31:33.984
Why don't we get
somethir out of it?

31:34.058 --> 31:36.390
What? You mean,
like helping you save face?

31:36.461 --> 31:39.658
Ben, this side of the river
got David Zifrirs confession

31:39.731 --> 31:41.221
admitted into evidence.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.995
You brought me nothing
remotely exculpatory.

31:44.068 --> 31:46.161
I have my case.
I'm proceeding to trial.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.911
He has the mind
of a 7-year-old, Adam.

31:57.015 --> 31:58.812
He needs to prove himself.

31:58.883 --> 32:01.181
Anyone who knows that
can manipulate him.

32:01.252 --> 32:04.983
Yeah. So Torelli
walked him right smack
into a murder charge?

32:05.056 --> 32:08.082
Yeah, he had a chance to break
two high-profile murder cases,

32:08.159 --> 32:09.922
and when Manattan
homicide got involved,

32:09.994 --> 32:12.292
he had even more
reason to come up
with a quick suspect.

32:12.363 --> 32:13.295
Mmm-hmm.

32:13.364 --> 32:15.525
And Davy Zifrin happened to be
a convenient stooge?

32:15.600 --> 32:16.567
Yeah.

32:16.634 --> 32:17.794
Yeah.
Well, that won't play

32:17.869 --> 32:20.235
without a credible
stand-in for Zifrin.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.339
Yeah. But the only person
who can provide
that won't do so

32:23.408 --> 32:25.035
unless he gets a nod
from Frank Lazar.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.201
All right.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.871
You're just gonna
have to work around him.

32:29.280 --> 32:33.046
Maybe you can find a familiar
face among Lake's pals.

32:33.117 --> 32:34.948
I have Briscoe
and Logan on the case

32:35.019 --> 32:36.577
but they can't
thin out that haystack

32:36.654 --> 32:39.020
without
Brooklyrs cooperation.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.217
Welcome to
Frank Lazar's hit list.

32:41.292 --> 32:44.557
You've been subpoenaed
by Shambala Green
to appear in Brooklyn.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.392
As a witness
for Davy Zifrin.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.453
Oh.

32:49.233 --> 32:51.326
So I can tell
the jury about Marty Lake.

32:51.402 --> 32:52.835
She know
you talked to him?

32:52.904 --> 32:55.168
It's exculpatory, Adam,
I had to disclose it.

32:55.239 --> 32:56.672
I never thought
she'd subpoena me.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.333
(Schiff)
Well, talk her out of it.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.104
The interests
this office shares

33:00.178 --> 33:02.112
with the Kings County
district attorney

33:02.180 --> 33:04.580
takes precedence
over any one case.

33:06.451 --> 33:09.352
You know, the boy
was railroaded, Ben.
I can't prove it,

33:09.420 --> 33:11.854
and every time I bring it up,
he gets all pumped up.

33:11.923 --> 33:14.448
He gets insulted if I even
suggest he didn't do it.

33:14.525 --> 33:17.426
I just need you to
repeat what Lake told you.

33:17.495 --> 33:18.587
It's hearsay.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.062
Statement
against interest.

33:20.131 --> 33:22.531
Lake revealed his involvement
in a drug enterprise.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.659
Iook, Ben, you wouldn't
have told me about Lake

33:24.736 --> 33:26.533
unless you thought
Davy was innocent.

33:26.604 --> 33:28.037
My opinion
is not evidence.

33:28.106 --> 33:29.869
You're better off
with Lake on the stand.

33:29.941 --> 33:31.704
I've already tried
talking to his lawyer.

33:31.776 --> 33:33.471
It seems unless somebody
pays the piper,

33:33.544 --> 33:35.034
the piper plans
to take the Fifth.

33:35.113 --> 33:37.581
And why use a tin flute
when you get a trumpet, right?

33:37.648 --> 33:40.208
The fact that the Executive
Assistant District Attorney

33:40.284 --> 33:42.980
might make a better
impression on the jury

33:43.054 --> 33:44.851
never crossed my mind.

33:44.922 --> 33:46.014
Girl Scout's honor.

33:46.090 --> 33:47.057
Sure.

33:50.395 --> 33:53.796
According to Mr. Lake,
this individual told him

33:53.865 --> 33:55.628
that he had killed Mary Davis

33:55.700 --> 33:57.964
and another individual
in Manattan,

33:58.036 --> 34:00.766
and that he did it
in order to steal the drugs.

34:02.807 --> 34:05.799
Did Mr. Lake
identify this individual?

34:06.310 --> 34:09.074
No. He wanted his own
drug charges dismissed

34:09.179 --> 34:11.341
in exchange for
that information.

34:11.649 --> 34:14.139
I told him that only
the district attorney

34:14.217 --> 34:15.742
in Kings County
could do that,

34:16.087 --> 34:19.579
and he said that he'd already
spoken to the Brooklyn police.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.356
What, if any,
action did you then take

34:22.427 --> 34:24.690
with regards to
what Mr. Lake told you?

34:24.762 --> 34:27.889
I met with Mr. Lazar
and Det. Torelli,

34:27.998 --> 34:29.489
and I asked Mr. Lazar

34:29.567 --> 34:32.661
to, uh, arrange
a plea bargain with Mr. Lake.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.568
Are you aware
of any consequences

34:34.639 --> 34:36.402
resulting from
this conversation?

34:36.507 --> 34:39.840
None. Mr. Lake is
still in the Brooklyn
House of Detention,

34:39.911 --> 34:43.745
and the individual he spoke of
is still not identified.

34:44.282 --> 34:45.873
Thank you, Mr. Stone.

34:47.185 --> 34:48.413
Your witness.

34:51.722 --> 34:52.916
Mr. Stone.

34:53.391 --> 34:55.985
Did there come a time
when David Zifrin was arrested

34:56.060 --> 34:58.028
and charged with a crime
in New York county?

34:58.096 --> 34:59.620
Objection,
Your Honor.

34:59.697 --> 35:00.959
Approach.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.599
Your Honor,
Mr. Lazar is trying

35:05.670 --> 35:07.570
to introduce evidence
from another crime

35:07.638 --> 35:09.367
not within the scope
of this trial.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.772
If I'm to challenge
the credibility
of this witness,

35:11.843 --> 35:13.208
I must be allowed
some latitude.

35:13.277 --> 35:17.213
Long as you keep both feet
on this side of the line,
Mr. Lazar.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.044
The objectives
of the prosecutor

35:19.117 --> 35:21.517
do not outweigh the rights
of this defendant.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.520
The witness will
answer the question.

35:24.589 --> 35:26.250
Yes, he was charged.

35:27.225 --> 35:29.420
Was a statement
taken from David Zifrin

35:29.494 --> 35:30.722
in connection
with this crime?

35:30.795 --> 35:31.853
Yes.

35:31.929 --> 35:34.557
Do you plan to introduce
Mr. Zifrirs statement
at trial?

35:34.632 --> 35:35.724
No.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.564
Is that because the statement
was suppressed
by a Manattan court?

35:38.636 --> 35:40.433
Yes. Because of
a procedural impropriety

35:40.505 --> 35:42.234
by the Brooklyn
Police Department.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.933
Move to strike.
Unresponsive.

35:44.008 --> 35:46.738
The jury will disregard
the witness's last remark.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.039
(Lazar)
Mr. Stone,

35:48.112 --> 35:51.047
what's the present status of
your case against Mr. Zifrin?

35:51.115 --> 35:52.742
The charges
are still pending.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.342
Isn't it fair to characterize
your prosecution of Mr. Zifrin

35:55.419 --> 35:58.582
is essentially stalled
in its tracks due to
your inability to make a case?

35:58.656 --> 36:00.283
No.
Charges are still pending.

36:00.358 --> 36:01.450
Mr. Stone,

36:01.526 --> 36:03.460
was your conversation
with Mr. Lake

36:03.528 --> 36:05.393
part of an effort
to jump-start that case?

36:05.463 --> 36:07.761
I renew my objection,
Your Honor.

36:07.832 --> 36:11.131
Enough, Mr. Lazar.
Move on to something else.

36:11.536 --> 36:13.128
Finally, Mr. Stone,

36:13.437 --> 36:16.429
are you really testifying
in Mr. Zifrirs behalf

36:17.141 --> 36:19.132
or are you simply looking
for a scapegoat

36:19.210 --> 36:20.472
for your own incompetence?

36:20.545 --> 36:21.773
Your Honor...

36:23.447 --> 36:25.244
My motives
are irrelevant, sir.

36:25.316 --> 36:26.715
I'm under oath.

36:30.621 --> 36:32.111
[Doorbell chiming]

36:35.626 --> 36:38.322
Looks like Frank Lazar
won the beauty contest.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.793
David Zifrin,
guilty on all counts.

36:41.132 --> 36:42.429
[Sighing]

36:43.868 --> 36:46.462
Maybe we should have used
a bigger stick on Marty Lake.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.334
Yeah. A magic wand
would be more useful.

36:48.406 --> 36:49.464
Without it,
there's no way

36:49.540 --> 36:52.168
we can make narcotics charges
disappear in Brooklyn.

36:52.243 --> 36:54.040
The special
narcotics prosecutor might.

36:54.111 --> 36:55.169
Jerry Silbo?

36:55.246 --> 36:56.372
In his mandate,

36:56.447 --> 36:59.348
he can take over jurisdiction
on any drug charge
in the five boroughs.

36:59.417 --> 37:01.442
You want him to step in
to release Marty Lake?

37:01.519 --> 37:02.543
Yeah.

37:02.620 --> 37:03.917
I doubt
that's in his mandate.

37:03.988 --> 37:05.250
We'll see.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.248
I put Marty Lake
back on the street.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.726
What for? So he can resume
his service to the community?

37:10.795 --> 37:13.730
As bad as Lake's crimes are,
they pale by comparison
to these murders.

37:13.798 --> 37:16.596
Ben, unless this advances
my department's
prosecutorial interests...

37:16.667 --> 37:20.364
Jerry, this is not
about servicing
anyone's body count.

37:20.438 --> 37:23.373
Well, my obligation is
to keep scum like Marty Lake
off the street.

37:23.441 --> 37:25.306
And to protect
the rights of the innocent.

37:25.376 --> 37:26.866
We took
the same oath, Jerry.

37:26.944 --> 37:28.878
Do you have any idea
of what kind of crap

37:28.946 --> 37:30.641
I'd get into
if I went along with this?

37:30.715 --> 37:32.706
You can always duck.
I'll take the hit.

37:34.619 --> 37:36.246
If you've got
a bullet-proof vest, Ben,

37:36.320 --> 37:38.288
then I hope you plan
to sleep in it.

37:41.392 --> 37:42.654
[Engine starting]

37:47.164 --> 37:48.290
[Phone ringing]

37:48.366 --> 37:49.731
That's the dude.

37:52.236 --> 37:53.794
James Lee Pawl.

37:54.905 --> 37:56.839
Jimmy Pawl. What I told you.

37:56.907 --> 37:58.169
Now can I leave?

37:58.242 --> 38:00.073
First you testify
and then you'll leave.

38:00.144 --> 38:01.133
Oh.

38:04.181 --> 38:05.375
I just talked to Adam.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.542
Frank Lazar's on
his way to his office.

38:09.687 --> 38:11.211
Who the hell
do you think you are?

38:11.289 --> 38:13.018
God's own avenging angel?

38:13.090 --> 38:15.786
You had no business
pulling a suspect
out of my jurisdiction.

38:15.860 --> 38:17.327
You could've
saved me the trouble.

38:17.395 --> 38:19.829
But it's clear that you and I
have a different understanding

38:19.897 --> 38:21.558
of the duties of
the office of the D.A.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.566
My duties are to
the people of Kings County.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.398
I doubt they'd appreciate
you poaching cases out
of their backyard.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.267
What they might
not appreciate is how,

38:28.339 --> 38:29.533
with willful disregard,

38:29.607 --> 38:31.438
you sent
an innocent man to prison.

38:32.543 --> 38:33.567
Stone,

38:34.145 --> 38:36.511
I'm gonna tie
a tin can to your tail.

38:36.747 --> 38:37.873
When the public hears

38:37.948 --> 38:40.075
how you abused your powers
to free a dope dealer...

38:40.151 --> 38:41.345
Hold it, sir.

38:41.619 --> 38:44.452
You bring in the media,
they're gonna get
both sides of the story:

38:44.655 --> 38:46.247
Malicious prosecution,

38:46.324 --> 38:49.122
failure to disclose,
professional misconduct.

38:49.593 --> 38:51.561
Unless you want
a real fight on your hands,

38:51.629 --> 38:53.392
stay out of camera range.

38:59.770 --> 39:00.828
[Door slams]

39:01.138 --> 39:02.833
Yeah, I know.
But I can't, you know.

39:02.907 --> 39:05.068
I ain't got no time for it.

39:05.142 --> 39:06.507
[All chattering]

39:07.845 --> 39:08.971
Move.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.288
Probable cause.
You got no probable cause.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.189
You're under arrest because
you're probably guilty.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.383
What is this?

39:22.460 --> 39:24.087
My... my medicine.
I got headaches.

39:24.161 --> 39:25.185
Yeah?

39:25.262 --> 39:26.957
That's a lot of
headache for a pinead.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.157
Come on.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.897
You want him to cop to
Victoria Hemmings

39:32.970 --> 39:34.665
and Mary Davis?

39:34.739 --> 39:36.536
As accommodating
as Jimmy is,

39:36.607 --> 39:38.598
he's not gonna
clear your desk for you.

39:38.676 --> 39:40.837
He should've taken a broom
to his own closet.

39:40.911 --> 39:42.936
Six bottles of Percodan,

39:43.047 --> 39:45.675
one ski jacket with
blood stains on the sleeve,

39:45.750 --> 39:47.650
one pair of running shoes
wear a pattern

39:47.718 --> 39:50.084
matching the prints
found in Hemmings' apartment.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.917
Not to mention
a conviction in Florida

39:51.989 --> 39:53.217
for cutting up a girl.

39:53.290 --> 39:54.552
What got into you, Jimmy?

39:54.625 --> 39:56.752
You thought she'd look better
with a glass eye?

39:56.827 --> 39:59.022
Talk, talk, talk. It doesn't
put him in Brooklyn

39:59.096 --> 40:00.495
or near Mary Davis.

40:00.564 --> 40:01.861
According to Marty Lake,

40:01.932 --> 40:04.423
he's already talked his way
across the bridge.

40:05.102 --> 40:06.433
You give Jimmy
enough dope,

40:06.504 --> 40:09.302
he'll talk his way to
a grassy knoll in Dallas.

40:09.373 --> 40:12.069
No one dreamed up this
evidence in his apartment.

40:12.143 --> 40:15.271
It earns him 25-to-life
for killing Hemmings.

40:15.446 --> 40:17.346
Add to that
assault one, robbery one,

40:17.415 --> 40:19.349
six counts of
criminal possession.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.477
50 years before he even takes
a peek at a parole board.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.521
But if he pleads
to two counts murder two,

40:25.589 --> 40:27.557
for Hemmings and Mary Davis

40:27.625 --> 40:29.718
with concurrent terms,
he's out in 25.

40:29.794 --> 40:32.092
As far as I can see,
your ability to make a deal

40:32.163 --> 40:34.927
ends somewhere in the middle
of the East River.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.191
You can't even
plead on Brooklyn.

40:37.368 --> 40:39.768
Why don't you let me
worry about jurisdiction.

40:39.837 --> 40:42.032
Mr. Pawl,
I am the only person

40:42.106 --> 40:44.700
standing between you
and Ossining state prison.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.369
Unless that's where you want
to receive the last rites,

40:47.445 --> 40:49.777
I suggest you take
my offer very seriously.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.845
You want me that bad
for Nurse Davis,

40:51.916 --> 40:53.247
you better dig deeper.

40:53.951 --> 40:57.114
Man one on both counts,
to serve concurrently.

40:57.254 --> 40:58.983
He's out in 15.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.218
15 years is too lenient, but
if Jimmy Pawl pleads guilty

41:03.294 --> 41:05.592
to murdering Mary Davis
then Zifrin gets off the hook.

41:05.663 --> 41:07.426
The issue
is moot anyway.

41:07.865 --> 41:10.095
You don't have jurisdiction
over the Brooklyn murder.

41:10.167 --> 41:12.499
You can't offer Pawl
as much as a breath mint.

41:12.570 --> 41:15.232
Yeah, but since
the underlying crime
involves narcotics,

41:15.306 --> 41:17.001
Jerry Silbo can
take over jurisdiction

41:17.074 --> 41:18.803
under Article 5B
and hand it to us.

41:18.876 --> 41:20.275
Oh, why?
Have you talked to him?

41:20.344 --> 41:21.641
Yeah. But he's gun-shy.

41:21.712 --> 41:24.237
He took enough of a beating
doing me a favor
over Marty Lake.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.646
Marty Lake?
Yeah.

41:25.716 --> 41:26.910
[Laughs]

41:27.184 --> 41:29.652
Marty Lake is a choir boy.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.781
You plead out
a monster like Jimmy Pawl,

41:32.857 --> 41:35.655
you might run into
a few baseball bats yourself.

41:35.726 --> 41:39.253
Davy Zifrin is on day four
of a 25-year sentence.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.560
My popularity
doesn't seem so important.

41:41.632 --> 41:43.827
Adam,
you talk to Jerry Silbo.

41:43.901 --> 41:46.665
Even if you think
that Jimmy Pawl
deserves a reduced sentence

41:46.737 --> 41:48.329
for brutally
murdering two women,

41:48.405 --> 41:50.600
don't think
that Davy Zifrin

41:50.774 --> 41:52.742
will be instantly
carried to freedom

41:52.810 --> 41:54.004
on the wings of angels.

41:54.078 --> 41:56.069
I'm familiar with
the appeals process.

41:56.146 --> 41:58.171
Well, then
you must also be familiar

41:58.249 --> 41:59.876
with
the latest pronouncements

41:59.950 --> 42:01.781
from Rehnquist and Scolia:

42:02.186 --> 42:04.711
Innocence is no bar
to upholding a conviction.

42:04.788 --> 42:06.722
We have to give
Davy Zifrin a chance

42:06.790 --> 42:08.348
to put that to the test.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.517
[Snickers]

42:11.962 --> 42:13.452
I'll call Silbo.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.126
But you'll have to do
better than 15 years.

42:24.475 --> 42:27.535
So before my client agrees
to any manslaughter plea

42:27.611 --> 42:29.374
involving
Brooklyn or Manattan...

42:29.446 --> 42:32.210
I'm not here to discuss
a manslaughter plea,
Ms. Goldman.

42:32.283 --> 42:33.716
Please sit down.

42:33.784 --> 42:35.445
I have your client
dead to rights

42:35.519 --> 42:37.578
on murder two in
the death of Vicky Hemmings.

42:37.655 --> 42:40.590
And I also have jurisdiction
over the murder of Mary Davis.

42:40.658 --> 42:42.853
And I'm fully prepared
to prosecute him
for that crime.

42:42.927 --> 42:44.895
With what?
Your boyish charm?

42:47.565 --> 42:50.728
We traced the lot numbers
of the Percodan bottles
in his apartment.

42:50.801 --> 42:53.770
Two of those bottles
were traced directly
to Mary Davis' hospital.

42:53.837 --> 42:54.963
Circumstantial.

42:55.039 --> 42:56.370
After the jury takes a look,

42:56.440 --> 42:58.431
and I mean a good look
at your client,

42:58.509 --> 43:01.000
they're not gonna care
about what's circumstantial.

43:01.078 --> 43:02.511
So what are you offering?

43:02.580 --> 43:04.445
As much as I think
that your client

43:04.515 --> 43:06.380
should spend
the rest of his life in jail,

43:06.450 --> 43:08.213
my original offer
is still on the table.

43:08.285 --> 43:09.547
Murder two, two counts,

43:09.620 --> 43:11.884
sentences to be
served concurrently.

43:11.956 --> 43:12.980
Take it or leave it.

43:13.057 --> 43:15.890
That's 25, minimum.
I can't do 25.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.587
Do as much as you can.

43:26.170 --> 43:27.762
You don't believe
I did it.

43:28.105 --> 43:30.164
Because you don't think
I'd know how.

43:30.307 --> 43:31.433
But you're wrong.

43:31.508 --> 43:33.976
We know you didn't
kill that girl, Davy.

43:34.211 --> 43:36.372
You don't know
anything about me.

43:36.714 --> 43:39.046
I know that
you're smart enough to see

43:39.116 --> 43:42.085
that things have changed
since you confessed.

43:44.054 --> 43:45.385
I don't care.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.924
I keep my word.

43:48.492 --> 43:49.982
(Green)
Keep your word?

43:50.761 --> 43:51.989
To who?

43:53.163 --> 43:55.358
To my friend
who helped me.

43:55.499 --> 43:57.399
You mean, Det. Torelli?

44:01.405 --> 44:02.997
When there was trouble

44:03.240 --> 44:05.231
because I touched that girl,

44:05.676 --> 44:07.610
I did exactly what he said

44:07.678 --> 44:09.339
and everything was okay.

44:09.747 --> 44:12.477
Did Det. Torelli
tell you to say

44:12.549 --> 44:14.574
that you killed the nurses?

44:17.955 --> 44:20.549
He said people
remembered me from before.

44:20.624 --> 44:22.785
They'd say
it was my fault again.

44:23.961 --> 44:25.519
And you believed him?

44:26.563 --> 44:29.760
He was gonna help me.
To get it straight.

44:30.868 --> 44:32.460
He showed me photographs

44:32.536 --> 44:34.868
and secret things
only the police could see.

44:34.938 --> 44:38.032
He made you say things
that werert true, Davy.

44:40.110 --> 44:42.271
He said
they'd blame me anyway

44:42.913 --> 44:44.574
because of the way I am.

44:45.849 --> 44:48.682
But if I'd learned
everything,

44:49.286 --> 44:50.913
if I could remember,

44:51.422 --> 44:54.482
then people would say
I was really smart.

44:55.859 --> 44:57.258
[Panting]

45:08.272 --> 45:09.739
One fifty-seven.

45:11.141 --> 45:12.301
Date of birth?

45:12.376 --> 45:13.866
(man)
November 27.

45:16.113 --> 45:17.512
What are
you guys doing here?

45:17.581 --> 45:19.640
Det. Torelli,
this is Lt. Jorgensen,

45:19.717 --> 45:20.945
Internal Affairs.

45:22.419 --> 45:23.579
What's goir on, Lennie?

45:23.654 --> 45:25.645
(Jorgensen)
Brian Torelli,
you're under arrest

45:25.723 --> 45:28.590
for subornation of perjury,
obstruction of justice.

45:28.859 --> 45:30.087
[Snickering]
You're nuts.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.825
Hey, Lennie,
guy's got it all wrong.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.796
I'm lookir at
what's wrong.

45:37.334 --> 45:38.892
You have the right
to remain silent,

45:38.969 --> 45:40.266
and refuse to
answer questions.

45:40.337 --> 45:41.531
Do you understand?
