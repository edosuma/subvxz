WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.570
TERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:02.603 --> 00:05.239
We got your brother out.
Seems like you owe us.

00:05.273 --> 00:07.007
You got credit
as long as you need it.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.576
Been a pleasure, my friend.
(both kiss)

00:08.609 --> 00:10.578
The tunnel's gone.
An explosion.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.846
(explosion)

00:12.880 --> 00:14.682
Who did it?

00:14.715 --> 00:16.717
Teresa.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.252
FINNERMAN: Postak and Felix
just lost eyes on Guero.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.920
Shit.

00:19.953 --> 00:22.223
I've just been feeding
these guys bullshit

00:22.256 --> 00:23.857
until I could find
my way back to you.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.693
You're a liar.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.161
TERESA: If Camila finds out
about the DEA,

00:27.195 --> 00:29.197
she'll kill you,
she'll kill me.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.099
POTE: Whatever you're hiding
better be worth it.

00:31.132 --> 00:34.735
Living in a safe house
doesn't mean you're safe.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.370
(dramatic music)

00:38.072 --> 00:39.107
(upbeat music over radio)

00:39.140 --> 00:41.041
(speaking Spanish)

00:47.748 --> 00:49.016
(gunshot)

00:49.049 --> 00:51.085
(gunshot)
(music continuing)

00:51.119 --> 00:54.088
(man singing Spanish)

00:54.122 --> 01:01.129
*

01:13.407 --> 01:14.475
CORTEZ: This little bird

01:14.508 --> 01:17.044
will solve all our problems.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.045
What's the payload?

01:18.078 --> 01:19.547
Two kilos.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.249
The smaller the drone,
the less the risk.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.217
They ship in two weeks.

01:23.251 --> 01:26.220
Our partners in Texas are
really running low on product.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.655
And the Colombians
are questioning

01:27.688 --> 01:29.390
our operational abilities.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.991
The Colombians
aren't our problem.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.294
It's your wife.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.828
(soft dramatic music)

01:34.862 --> 01:36.297
(speaking Spanish)

01:41.502 --> 01:43.271
(speaking Spanish)

01:44.972 --> 01:46.240
(gun fires)
Get down!

01:46.274 --> 01:47.675
(gunshot)
(glass smashes)

01:47.708 --> 01:49.777
(tires squeal)
(bullets ricochet)

01:49.810 --> 01:51.812
(gunfire)

01:51.845 --> 01:53.914
(dramatic music)

01:53.947 --> 01:55.316
(pistol fires)

01:55.349 --> 01:57.418
(pistol firing)

01:57.451 --> 01:58.519
*

01:58.552 --> 02:00.188
(gunshots)

02:00.221 --> 02:01.255
(man shouting Spanish)
(engine turns over)

02:01.289 --> 02:02.656
(tires squeal)

02:02.690 --> 02:05.693
(pistol fires)

02:06.960 --> 02:09.029
(gun clicking)

02:09.062 --> 02:10.698
(gun locks)
(gun fires)

02:10.731 --> 02:13.100
(shell casing rattles)

02:13.133 --> 02:16.136
(breathing heavily)

02:20.308 --> 02:21.709
(birds calling)

02:27.815 --> 02:29.383
(soft music)

02:29.417 --> 02:31.219
GUERO: Want to see
a magic trick?

02:31.252 --> 02:33.554
*

02:33.587 --> 02:36.490
All right, now blow it out.

02:36.524 --> 02:42.863
*

02:42.896 --> 02:44.031
(gasps)

02:44.064 --> 02:45.499
How'd you do it?

02:45.533 --> 02:48.536
-Magic.
-(laughs)

02:52.340 --> 02:53.907
How'd you do it?

02:53.941 --> 02:55.443
Figure it out.

03:03.451 --> 03:04.718
(door shuts)

03:04.752 --> 03:06.254
JAMES: You all right?

03:06.287 --> 03:07.855
I'm fine.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.491
Something's come up.
I need you inside.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.393
I'll be right there.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.331
Well, everything
went as planned.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.767
CAMILA: Your shipment arrives
in Galveston tomorrow.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.202
And my people will be there
to pick it up.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.937
You run a tight ship, Camila.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.906
Something I've always
admired about you.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.409
Well, what happened in Mexico
was a setback.

03:28.442 --> 03:31.279
But soon you'll be sending me
packages every week.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.514
(chuckles)
I have no doubt.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.116
And I look forward to
celebrating our new partnership

03:36.149 --> 03:38.252
at my godson Nico's wedding.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.388
You'll be joining us, I hope.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.524
Sinaloa is a still a very
dangerous place for me, Manuel.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.459
MANUEL: Well, if you're
worried about Epifanio,

03:45.493 --> 03:48.429
(speaking Spanish)

03:48.462 --> 03:50.398
I can send my plane
along with my bodyguards

03:50.431 --> 03:52.566
to escort you.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.535
Well, how can I say no to that?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.370
Boaz will be pleased.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.605
He wants to personally thank you

03:57.638 --> 03:59.473
for rescuing him from the DEA.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.074
How is your brother?

04:01.108 --> 04:03.210
Well, to tell you the truth,

04:03.243 --> 04:06.246
Boaz is a pain in my ass.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.782
If my mother weren't alive,

04:08.816 --> 04:10.618
I would have made you
put a bullet in his head.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.620
It would have saved me
a lot of trouble.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.588
CAMILA: Family's family, Manuel.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.789
What can I tell you?

04:15.823 --> 04:17.891
We all have our crosses to bear.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.894
(soft brooding music)

04:20.928 --> 04:25.132
*

04:25.165 --> 04:26.166
I'm gonna have to call you back.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.135
MANUEL: Okay.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.404
You remember Denny, our man
in the sheriff's department.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.272
We have a situation.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.107
Tell her.

04:34.141 --> 04:37.077
After the raid, I cozied up
to one of the DEA agents.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.112
According to her,
they have an informant.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.315
That's who led them
back to the warehouse.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.751
-Did she tell you a name?
-No, not yet.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.353
And I'm gonna require
a little more time.

04:45.386 --> 04:48.489
I understand.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.790
Keep us apprised.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.497
Without a name, we don't
know how exposed we are.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.298
We can't wait on Denny,

04:58.332 --> 05:02.102
not when the Jimenez shipment
is coming into Galveston.

05:02.135 --> 05:06.674
I'm not taking any chances.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.308
You're gonna hunt down

05:08.342 --> 05:10.878
and then

05:10.911 --> 05:13.514
you're gonna kill that rata.

05:21.188 --> 05:24.191
(dramatic music)

05:31.198 --> 05:34.034
It was a coordinated attack,
starting with the tunnels.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.903
We don't know that
Camila was behind this.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.304
The attack could have
come from anywhere.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.739
Rival cartels.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.841
Even the families
of my own lieutenants.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.209
Papi!

05:42.242 --> 05:43.210
Oh.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.745
Are you okay?

05:44.778 --> 05:45.979
I am fine.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.148
Oh, I was so worried about you.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.917
Oh, I am here now.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.552
Everything's all right,
nothing to worry about.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.253
Was it the cartel?

05:53.286 --> 05:55.723
Yes, but that won't
stop me from shutting them down.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.058
Hey, look at me.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.727
I'm not going anywhere.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.496
(speaking Spanish)
Okay?

06:02.530 --> 06:04.532
Wait for me in the den.
I'll be right there.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.533
Mi'ja.
(kisses)

06:08.402 --> 06:10.237
The people who did this
are rabid dogs.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.173
And they are going
to be killed that way.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.241
And if I'm right?

06:14.274 --> 06:17.077
If it was Camila?

06:17.110 --> 06:19.413
Then she'll meet the same fate.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.990
Are you all right, mi'ja ?

06:34.327 --> 06:35.963
When you became governor,

06:35.996 --> 06:37.698
I thought we were
through with that life,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.433
through with
having to worry that

06:39.467 --> 06:41.469
someone was gonna
kill you in the streets.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.270
(drink pours)

06:43.303 --> 06:45.405
Was I wrong?

06:45.439 --> 06:48.442
Was I being naive?

06:48.476 --> 06:49.643
Tell me.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.145
(uneasy music)

06:52.179 --> 06:55.816
No.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.785
You're not wrong.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.554
That part of my life,
of our lives,

07:00.588 --> 07:02.990
is over.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.694
Andale.

07:10.831 --> 07:14.334
I'm just a governor now.
That's all.

07:14.367 --> 07:18.138
I had to wage war
on the cartel

07:18.171 --> 07:21.775
and rid the streets of
their violence once and for all.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.277
And as a result,

07:24.311 --> 07:26.680
there are people
who want nothing more

07:26.714 --> 07:30.618
than to see me dead.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.787
And someday,

07:33.821 --> 07:35.823
God forbid,

07:35.856 --> 07:38.191
if they succeed,

07:38.225 --> 07:41.261
I pray that you remember me

07:41.294 --> 07:44.598
not as the man I was,

07:44.632 --> 07:48.201
but as the man
that I aspire to be,

07:48.235 --> 07:50.804
the man who wants nothing more

07:50.838 --> 07:53.440
than to make his daughter proud.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.443
(tender music)

07:56.476 --> 07:59.279
*

07:59.312 --> 08:01.982
I am, Papi.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.452
I'm so proud of you.

08:05.485 --> 08:12.425
*

08:13.661 --> 08:16.830
(bird caws)

08:18.231 --> 08:21.201
Manuel's bodyguards are
waiting downstairs for you.

08:21.234 --> 08:24.337
Do you believe in omens?

08:24.371 --> 08:26.339
When I woke up this morning,

08:26.373 --> 08:29.843
there was a crow
sitting in the windowsill.

08:29.877 --> 08:33.981
There's been an assassination
attempt on Epifanio.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.549
When?

08:35.583 --> 08:37.751
This morning, but don't worry.
Isabela's fine.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.186
She wasn't with him.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.689
He escaped
without a scratch, though.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.358
You're relieved?

08:45.392 --> 08:47.094
Epifanio's a bastard.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.598
But he's still
Isabela's father.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.701
If something
were to happen to him,

08:53.734 --> 08:57.237
Isabela would be devastated.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.039
We're at war.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.008
One way or another, she's
gonna have her heart broken.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.710
He's gonna suspect
you ordered the hit.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.044
Yeah, I know.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.512
Well, then you know
that Mexico's

09:05.545 --> 09:07.514
the last place you want
to be right now.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.617
(soft dramatic music)

09:09.650 --> 09:11.719
You didn't answer my question...

09:11.752 --> 09:14.454
*

09:14.487 --> 09:15.923
About the omens.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.258
I don't believe in omens.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.293
I believe in survival instinct.

09:20.327 --> 09:23.997
Like the one that tells me to
stay away from wounded lions.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.111
Guero, it's me.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.213
(knocking)

09:40.247 --> 09:42.883
Guero, open the door.

09:42.916 --> 09:43.951
(doorknob turns)

09:47.855 --> 09:50.824
(suspenseful music)

09:50.858 --> 09:57.865
*

10:02.670 --> 10:04.471
You spared my life in Mexico,

10:04.504 --> 10:06.907
just to put me
in an American prison?

10:06.940 --> 10:08.008
Listen to me,

10:08.041 --> 10:11.078
I'm not the rat.
Okay?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.145
Put the gun down.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.314
Tell me the truth.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.950
Who did you come here to meet?

10:16.984 --> 10:18.886
Tell me!

10:21.454 --> 10:22.923
Guero.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.992
(soft dramatic music)

10:25.025 --> 10:26.526
Guero?

10:26.559 --> 10:28.128
He's alive.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.630
The DEA grabbed him
before his plane exploded.

10:30.664 --> 10:34.134
Epifanio didn't kill him.

10:34.167 --> 10:38.672
So he's the informant.

10:38.706 --> 10:41.508
And you've been
meeting with him.

10:41.541 --> 10:45.078
*

10:46.413 --> 10:48.548
That doesn't make any sense.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.583
We need you.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.655
I don't believe it.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.126
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.460
GUERO: Take it easy, bro.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.029
"Bro"? (tsks)

11:02.062 --> 11:04.832
Ain't no bros here.
That shit is over.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.366
I'll be damned.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.301
I just got off the phone
with Interpol.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.004
I figured you'd be
halfway to Costa Rica by now.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.340
I wasn't running, I just--
(sniffs)

11:13.373 --> 11:14.341
needed to clear my head.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.843
Bullshit.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.178
He ran off
to see his little haina.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.847
Bet you tried to get her
to run away with you, huh?

11:19.880 --> 11:22.482
She wouldn't do it?

11:22.515 --> 11:25.052
Chose a cartel over you.

11:25.085 --> 11:28.088
What do you say, Guero?

11:28.121 --> 11:30.190
You get your heart broken?

11:30.223 --> 11:33.193
(soft dramatic music)

11:33.226 --> 11:40.200
*

11:40.233 --> 11:45.272
You're right.

11:45.305 --> 11:49.209
Now I ain't got
no reason to protect her.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.945
I came back
to help you catch her.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.148
(phone vibrating)

11:57.117 --> 11:58.085
(speaking Spanish)

11:58.118 --> 11:59.552
JAMES: It's James.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.321
Denny came through.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.961
Denny has a line on your rat.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.430
You're gonna have to choose,
Teresa.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.966
Him or us.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.671
(door turns open)

12:20.640 --> 12:22.409
(door closes shut)

12:23.676 --> 12:26.646
(elegant Latin string music)

12:26.679 --> 12:33.686
*

12:35.422 --> 12:38.425
(chattering)

12:43.596 --> 12:45.098
Camila.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.234
-Manuel.
-How was your trip?

12:47.267 --> 12:50.037
Wonderful.
Thank you.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.174
(speaking indistinctly)

12:54.875 --> 12:57.710
(speaking Spanish)

13:01.548 --> 13:03.150
(speaking Spanish)

13:04.651 --> 13:06.353
BOAZ: Camila Vargas.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.355
Boaz, looking good.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.656
(speaking Spanish)

13:14.895 --> 13:16.796
I just want to kiss my savior.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.798
(speaking Spanish)

13:20.567 --> 13:21.568
(kisses)

13:33.213 --> 13:35.849
FINNERMAN:
Recognize this asshole?

13:38.085 --> 13:39.319
Yeah, that's Rivas.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.021
He's with the Jimenez cartel.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.822
He was caught with three kilos.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.457
But instead of
asking for a lawyer,

13:44.491 --> 13:47.694
he asked for the DEA.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.496
So he wants to make a deal.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.464
He claims Jimenez
is smuggling 200 kilos

13:51.498 --> 13:53.533
into Galveston for Camila.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.168
He's offering
to give up the load.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.404
What we can't figure out
is why this guy

13:57.437 --> 14:00.107
would risk his life
to snitch on his boss.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.677
You want to know what I think?

14:04.711 --> 14:09.816
I think you don't look
a gift horse in the mouth.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.985
(tapping) He's handing you
Camila's head on a platter.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.854
So, y'all want to take
her and her people down?

14:14.888 --> 14:16.156
Make the deal.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.659
Get the location
of the drop-off.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.028
Make your damn bust.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.566
(soft music)

14:26.599 --> 14:30.537
*

14:30.570 --> 14:32.605
Want me to call the Galveston
field office to assist?

14:32.639 --> 14:35.208
FINNERMAN:
No, just our crew.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.743
I don't trust these pricks.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.611
I'll be damned
if I get caught out there

14:38.645 --> 14:41.381
with my dick in my hand
and another empty warehouse.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.516
Roger.
Surveillance mission only.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.186
Until it's not.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.687
(glasses clink)

14:47.720 --> 14:49.022
Por los novios.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.423
Salud.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.959
ALL: Salud.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.294
MANUEL:
A word from Señora Vargas.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.930
Felicidades a los novios.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.598
In good times,

14:58.631 --> 15:00.700
as in bad times,

15:00.733 --> 15:03.103
never lose sight
of what's important.

15:03.136 --> 15:06.073
Just remember this love
is just...

15:06.106 --> 15:08.908
(footsteps approaching)
(crowd murmuring)

15:08.942 --> 15:10.410
(brooding music)

15:10.443 --> 15:13.880
(indistinct chatter)

15:13.913 --> 15:15.648
*

15:15.682 --> 15:17.084
(speaking Spanish)

15:21.688 --> 15:27.127
*

15:33.366 --> 15:37.070
Epifanio.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.905
You know,
we were not expecting you.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.773
(speaking Spanish)

15:42.009 --> 15:44.978
(soft dramatic music)

15:45.012 --> 15:46.313
*

15:46.346 --> 15:48.415
A toast to the newlyweds.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.418
May your marriage
be filled with laughter,

15:51.451 --> 15:53.486
with fond memories,

15:53.520 --> 15:55.688
and with healthy children.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.791
May you never forget
the way she looks tonight.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.427
And may you never forget

16:00.460 --> 16:03.963
the way he's looking at you.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.499
-Salud.
ALL: Salud.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.900
Salud.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.708
I just requested our song.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.378
Please, humor me.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.014
I almost lost my life today.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.618
(gun clicks)

16:25.652 --> 16:27.120
Galveston PD are on standby.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.655
(gun clicks)
Good.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.223
Once we confirm
the drugs are there,

16:30.257 --> 16:32.192
we'll call in the cav.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.662
And say good-bye to
Camila and her gang for good.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.400
(phone buzzes)

16:44.771 --> 16:46.005
Hey, I'm at work.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.974
DENNY: I know.
Sorry.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.044
It's just--I can't stop
thinking about the other night.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.946
Of you and a bottle
of Dom Pérignon.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.417
Where are you?

16:57.450 --> 17:00.653
I'm at the Willow Street house.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.921
Give me an hour.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.924
(soft suspenseful music)

17:04.957 --> 17:11.964
*

17:14.033 --> 17:15.435
She's on her way.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.671
Good.
She'll give us what we need.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.939
We get the name of the rat,

17:19.972 --> 17:21.374
and then we get rid of her.

17:21.408 --> 17:22.875
She's a federal agent.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.512
Well, the DEA's gunning for us.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.914
If we don't do something,

17:27.947 --> 17:29.549
you, me, Camila,

17:29.582 --> 17:31.284
we're all gonna go down.

17:34.321 --> 17:38.057
Look, I don't like it
any more than you do.

17:38.091 --> 17:42.829
But I'm gonna do
whatever it takes to protect us.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.274
(romantic tango music)

17:54.307 --> 17:57.277
(man singing Spanish)

17:57.310 --> 17:59.946
*

17:59.979 --> 18:02.149
I have something to ask you,

18:02.182 --> 18:04.251
but I needed to
look you in the eyes.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.587
I didn't order
the assassination attempt.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.256
I know you think it was me.

18:09.289 --> 18:13.893
Colonel Cortez
thinks otherwise.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.662
Colonel Cortez,

18:15.695 --> 18:18.231
I can smell
his ambition from here.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.399
Perhaps you're right.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.567
Still,

18:20.600 --> 18:22.569
I know you blew up my tunnel.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.104
Yes, I did.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.440
But the assassination attempt,

18:27.474 --> 18:30.310
that wasn't me.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.079
You know,

18:33.112 --> 18:34.281
I miss this.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.916
*

18:36.949 --> 18:39.486
You were always
good on your feet.

18:39.519 --> 18:42.755
You used to think that
I was good off of them too.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.923
Well, I must admit, we never

18:43.956 --> 18:46.092
had a problem in either area.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.461
Perhaps that's because
I always allowed you to lead.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.829
Perhaps.

18:49.862 --> 18:56.869
*

18:58.871 --> 19:00.139
What happens when the music--

19:00.173 --> 19:02.575
(music stops)
ends?

19:06.313 --> 19:08.080
(indistinct chatter)

19:10.016 --> 19:11.684
Thank you for the dance.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.624
(suspenseful music)

19:17.657 --> 19:24.664
*

19:38.245 --> 19:39.746
All right, she's here.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.690
(suspenseful music)

19:50.723 --> 19:57.730
*

20:06.473 --> 20:09.376
(breathing shakily)

20:21.153 --> 20:22.789
(phone beeps)

20:27.660 --> 20:30.630
(dramatic music)

20:30.663 --> 20:37.670
*

21:02.429 --> 21:04.130
(phone beeps)

21:06.533 --> 21:13.005
*

21:18.678 --> 21:21.414
Whoa, whoa, what is she doing?

21:21.448 --> 21:24.351
Oh, she's leaving.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.022
What the hell just happened?

21:39.832 --> 21:41.167
What's going on?

21:41.200 --> 21:42.369
JAMES: It didn't work out.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.703
Something spooked the agent.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.204
We didn't get a name.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.474
Our package is waiting
for pickup.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.376
CAMILA: You need to
go to Galveston now.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.010
We should walk away.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.145
CAMILA: The rat led the DEA
to my warehouse,

21:53.179 --> 21:54.347
not my safe house.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.882
There's no reason to believe

21:55.915 --> 21:57.183
they know anything
about our business

21:57.216 --> 21:59.352
or the shipment Manuel sent us.

21:59.386 --> 22:01.053
You want to take that risk?

22:01.087 --> 22:02.855
We have no choice.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.558
That shipment is our last chance
to rebuild the business.

22:05.592 --> 22:08.995
Without it,
we're as good as dead.

22:09.028 --> 22:11.130
I'll call you when it's done.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.965
Good.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.033
(phone beeps)

22:14.066 --> 22:15.535
We're going to Galveston.

22:15.568 --> 22:18.538
(soft brooding music)

22:18.571 --> 22:20.740
*

22:26.212 --> 22:29.181
(elegant brass music playing)

22:29.215 --> 22:36.222
*

22:38.591 --> 22:42.595
You look beautiful
in that dress.

22:42.629 --> 22:43.896
What are you doing here, Mom?

22:43.930 --> 22:46.098
I could ask you the same thing.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.234
Does your father
know you're here?

22:48.267 --> 22:49.736
Yes.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.370
And he already said
I could stay.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.540
I need a moment
with my daughter.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.280
I've been trying to get
ahold of you for weeks.

23:01.313 --> 23:04.751
You know, just because
your father and I are separated,

23:04.784 --> 23:06.919
doesn't mean we
can't have a relationship.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.387
You're the one who left.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.122
Dad turned his back
on the cartel,

23:10.156 --> 23:11.858
and you turned your back on us.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.561
Is that what you think?

23:14.594 --> 23:16.929
Let me ask you something.

23:16.963 --> 23:20.867
If your father
is such a saint,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.102
what is he doing here?

23:23.135 --> 23:24.471
With these people?

23:24.504 --> 23:27.106
He's trying to broker peace.

23:27.139 --> 23:28.541
The only way to do that is

23:28.575 --> 23:30.042
to help legitimize
families like this.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.278
Give them a second chance.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.582
You really believe that?

23:35.615 --> 23:37.249
He's changed.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.552
And so have I.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.655
I don't want anything
to do with that world,

23:42.689 --> 23:44.657
or anyone in it.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.127
Fine.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.762
(soft dramatic music)

23:49.796 --> 23:51.464
Fine.

23:51.498 --> 23:54.000
*

23:54.033 --> 23:55.935
I know one day,

23:55.968 --> 23:57.436
you're going to realize that

23:57.470 --> 24:00.640
your father is
not what you think.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.308
And when that day comes,

24:02.341 --> 24:04.777
you're gonna know

24:04.811 --> 24:08.447
how unfair you've been to me.

24:08.481 --> 24:11.651
*

24:11.684 --> 24:12.885
(kisses)

24:16.556 --> 24:18.357
Enjoy the party.

24:22.061 --> 24:27.667
*

24:27.700 --> 24:29.435
EPIFANIO: Fully armored,

24:29.468 --> 24:31.871
just like the President
of the United States.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.707
You know, they call
his limousine "The Beast."

24:34.741 --> 24:37.043
Maybe I'll call mine

24:37.076 --> 24:38.310
El Monstro.

24:38.344 --> 24:39.512
(chuckling)

24:39.546 --> 24:41.548
So what's this all about?

24:41.581 --> 24:44.116
I mean, you didn't come all this
way to show me your new toy.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.985
You see, that's your problem,
Manuel.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.220
You're always in a hurry.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.189
You need to learn to relax.

24:50.222 --> 24:53.660
Like your brother here,
look at him.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.995
Well, maybe he knows
something I don't.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.731
Boaz thought it wise
to clean the air between us.

24:58.765 --> 25:01.467
It's not a secret that
we've had disagreements.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.403
And now that I've
consolidated power in the south,

25:04.436 --> 25:05.872
perhaps you're worried that

25:05.905 --> 25:07.574
I set my sights
on you in the north.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.175
Yeah, well, the thought
has crossed my mind.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.310
Oh, put your mind at ease.

25:11.343 --> 25:15.582
I've come to renew
our peace accord.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.849
Well, fine.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.184
Then I'd like to make a toast.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.418
But, Manuel,

25:19.451 --> 25:22.421
you have yet to hear my terms.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.491
Hey.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.893
Olivia!

25:26.926 --> 25:28.861
-Kique!
-What's up, what's up?

25:28.895 --> 25:30.496
¿Qué tal?

25:30.529 --> 25:31.564
Mwah.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.766
(upbeat music playing)

25:33.800 --> 25:35.234
Who's your friend?

25:35.267 --> 25:37.336
Isabela Vargas.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.606
*

25:39.639 --> 25:41.073
La narco-princesa.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.875
-What did you say?
-You heard me.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.577
Your father's Epifanio, right?

25:44.611 --> 25:45.845
Yes.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.113
And he's a governor.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.881
Not cartel.
Not anymore.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.516
Oh, right.
Excuse me.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.284
I wouldn't want him
siccing the army after me.

25:52.318 --> 25:53.886
Hey.
You're being an asshole.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.287
Orale, primo.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.590
Looks like your balls
finally dropped.

25:57.624 --> 26:00.159
Adios, narco-princesa!

26:02.328 --> 26:04.230
I'm really sorry.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.198
My cousin can be
a real asshole sometimes.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.901
That's okay.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.137
You really believe that stuff,

26:11.170 --> 26:13.405
what you said about your father?

26:13.439 --> 26:16.208
I do.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.444
It's cool he's got you
to defend him.

26:18.477 --> 26:21.648
(speaking Spanish)

26:23.816 --> 26:26.218
From this day forward,

26:26.252 --> 26:28.621
the Jimenez cartel
will cease to exist.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.790
You and your people
will work for me.

26:30.823 --> 26:33.492
No.
Never, I'll never agree to that.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.828
(speaking Spanish)

26:37.296 --> 26:38.264
You want a war, Epi,
I'll give you--

26:38.297 --> 26:39.565
(silenced gunshot)

26:39.598 --> 26:42.568
(dramatic music)

26:42.601 --> 26:49.608
*

26:50.509 --> 26:52.378
(speaking Spanish)

27:03.990 --> 27:07.927
(soft dramatic music)

27:07.960 --> 27:10.262
(guns locking)

27:10.296 --> 27:17.203
*

27:17.236 --> 27:21.440
You all right?

27:21.473 --> 27:25.111
I don't have
a good feeling about this.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.279
For all we know,
the snitch tipped the DEA

27:27.313 --> 27:29.515
and they're waiting for us,

27:29.548 --> 27:32.852
and we're heading into a trap.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.691
(speaking Spanish)

27:50.269 --> 27:52.038
What did you promise him?

27:52.071 --> 27:54.874
Someone has to oversee
the day-to-day operations.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.976
You handed him
the reins to the business?

27:57.009 --> 27:58.410
Everything I did, I did it

27:58.444 --> 28:00.980
for your protection
and your interests.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.681
What, by usurping my power?

28:02.715 --> 28:06.318
By making this deal
behind my back?

28:06.352 --> 28:08.755
I would have never
agreed to it.

28:08.788 --> 28:11.891
Manuel would have
come around, eventually.

28:11.924 --> 28:15.594
Manuel was the one behind
the assassination attempt.

28:15.627 --> 28:18.030
Boaz confirmed it.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.565
(soft chuckle)

28:19.598 --> 28:22.034
Of course,
I can't confirm it,

28:22.068 --> 28:24.737
since the assailants
are all dead.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.939
You made sure of that.

28:26.973 --> 28:29.508
I thought you would be pleased
to know it wasn't Camila.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.610
What about the shipment
Manuel sent her?

28:31.643 --> 28:33.379
Boaz took care of it.

28:33.412 --> 28:36.048
He sent his man Rivas
to tip the DEA.

28:36.082 --> 28:39.085
A man who kills
his own brother is a Judas.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.420
Yes,

28:41.453 --> 28:44.490
but he's our Judas.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.904
(cheers and applause)

28:58.637 --> 29:00.139
Lobito!

29:00.172 --> 29:03.509
(speaking Spanish)

29:11.017 --> 29:12.318
Don Epifanio Vargas.

29:12.351 --> 29:15.321
(upbeat song plays)

29:15.354 --> 29:17.223
*

29:17.256 --> 29:20.426
(singing Spanish)

29:42.448 --> 29:44.650
*

29:46.485 --> 29:48.154
FINNERMAN: After the takedown,

29:48.187 --> 29:50.689
I'll put Miss Mendoza
in the back with you.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.791
From here, it's a 12-minute
ride to the field office.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.626
That's how long
you'll have to convince her

29:54.660 --> 29:57.429
to save herself and turn state's
against Camila Vargas.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.966
(lighter flicks)

29:59.999 --> 30:01.300
And what if she doesn't agree?

30:01.333 --> 30:02.668
You'll walk.

30:02.701 --> 30:06.272
A free man.
New life, new identity.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.306
And Teresa?

30:07.339 --> 30:09.041
What happens to her?

30:09.075 --> 30:11.110
She'll spend what's left
of her child-bearing years

30:11.143 --> 30:13.445
in a federal hole.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.347
It's not easy
turning on the one you love.

30:15.381 --> 30:17.884
But that pain you feel
deep down,

30:17.917 --> 30:20.452
that thing
you think's a broken heart,

30:20.486 --> 30:22.021
it'll fade over time.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.522
Won't be long until
you're on the beach,

30:23.555 --> 30:25.157
sipping margaritas
with some other

30:25.191 --> 30:26.993
pretty, little
brown-skinned girl,

30:27.026 --> 30:28.560
make you forget
all about the one

30:28.594 --> 30:31.197
who chose Camila Vargas
over you.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.334
Look, I'm gonna do
what I need to do here,

30:35.367 --> 30:36.802
but I suggest
you shut the fuck up

30:36.835 --> 30:38.504
before I change my mind.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.372
(laughs)

30:40.406 --> 30:41.740
Oh, dear.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.675
(upbeat Latin music)

30:43.709 --> 30:45.711
(singing in Spanish)

31:27.453 --> 31:30.256
EPIFANIO: Shut him down. I don't
want to hear that song again.

31:48.474 --> 31:51.443
(dramatic suspense music)

31:51.477 --> 31:58.150
*

31:59.785 --> 32:02.021
That's our guy.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.660
Check it out.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.262
Make sure it's good.

32:12.931 --> 32:16.468
(ambient music)

32:16.502 --> 32:23.509
*

33:05.584 --> 33:12.591
*

33:26.072 --> 33:28.407
I just saw the handoff.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.410
All units, prepare to move.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.750
Let's get out of here.

33:38.784 --> 33:42.054
(bird cawing)

33:42.088 --> 33:43.189
(sirens wailing)

33:43.222 --> 33:46.024
(dramatic music)

33:46.058 --> 33:47.059
Shit.

33:47.093 --> 33:49.395
(engine turns over)

33:49.428 --> 33:51.997
(tires squeal)

33:52.030 --> 33:54.066

34:43.449 --> 34:46.252
Stay here!
Watch him!

34:46.285 --> 34:49.255
(dramatic music)

34:49.288 --> 34:54.826
*

34:54.860 --> 34:56.128
They're everywhere!

34:56.162 --> 34:57.363
Just keep moving!

34:59.198 --> 35:02.501
DEA federal agents!
Exit the building!

35:02.534 --> 35:05.937
How are we gonna
get out of here?

35:05.971 --> 35:08.540
Federal agents! Come out
with your hands above your head!

35:15.681 --> 35:17.916
We're not.
You are.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.351
What?

35:19.385 --> 35:21.187
-When you hear gunfire, you run.
-No. No.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.489
-Take the gun.
-No.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.324
We can do this.

35:30.028 --> 35:32.698
(indistinct shouting outside)

35:32.731 --> 35:34.566
It's okay.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.045
ALONZO: It's your girl.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.547
Doesn't look like you're gonna

35:48.580 --> 35:50.549
get the chance to say good-bye.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.551

36:05.397 --> 36:06.498
Teresa!

36:06.532 --> 36:08.800
(suspenseful music)

36:08.834 --> 36:09.868
Don't move.

36:09.901 --> 36:10.902
What are you doing?

36:10.936 --> 36:12.304
I saw you with them.

36:12.338 --> 36:15.507
I'm here to help you.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.843
I'd never do that to you.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.545
All right, I was just
trying to buy some time.

36:19.578 --> 36:20.712
You gotta believe me, babe.

36:20.746 --> 36:24.383
Don't move.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.552
I love you.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.320
-Bullshit.
-I'm with you.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.389
-I always will be with you.
-Hands in the air!

36:30.422 --> 36:33.692
Hands in the air!

36:33.725 --> 36:36.695
You need to lower your weapon,
Miss Mendoza.

36:36.728 --> 36:38.397
Drop the gun!

36:38.430 --> 36:39.665
Drop it!

36:39.698 --> 36:41.099
(brooding dramatic music)

36:41.132 --> 36:43.935
Everything's gonna be okay.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.070
We'll take care of you.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.272
On your knees.

36:47.306 --> 36:50.108
Ah!

36:50.141 --> 36:54.112

36:54.145 --> 36:55.581
You son of a bitch.

36:55.614 --> 36:59.751

TERESA: No!

36:59.785 --> 37:00.886
JAMES: Who the hell is this?

37:00.919 --> 37:02.854
He's with us.

37:02.888 --> 37:06.625
This is Guero!

37:06.658 --> 37:08.093
Put your gun down.

37:08.126 --> 37:09.695
Guero Dávila?

37:09.728 --> 37:11.029
You're the rat?

37:11.062 --> 37:15.534
*

37:15.567 --> 37:18.203
TERESA: The DEA agent.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.272
Is he dead?

37:20.306 --> 37:23.108
We have to go.

37:23.141 --> 37:25.411
I know a way out.
Follow me.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.585
(dramatic music)

37:33.619 --> 37:40.626
*

37:41.827 --> 37:44.796
Garret.
Garret!

37:47.499 --> 37:51.937
No!
Damn it, no!

37:51.970 --> 37:55.106
Guero!

38:01.380 --> 38:03.081
Don't shoot him.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.317
He was working with the DEA.

38:05.351 --> 38:09.321
He helped us.
You saw it.

38:09.355 --> 38:12.190
I just have one question
for you, Teresa.

38:12.223 --> 38:14.292
Did you know he was alive?

38:14.326 --> 38:17.596
No.

38:17.629 --> 38:22.401
Then we only have
one hole to dig.

38:25.837 --> 38:28.774
(brooding music)

38:28.807 --> 38:35.814
*

38:45.056 --> 38:47.559
You led the DEA to my warehouse.

38:47.593 --> 38:49.995
Everything I gave the DEA
was a dead end.

38:50.028 --> 38:55.734
Every name, every location
was already burned.

38:55.767 --> 38:59.004
And it's because of this
you think I shouldn't kill you?

38:59.037 --> 39:03.542
No, I think you shouldn't
kill me 'cause you need me.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.711
The Jimenez brothers,
they screwed you over,

39:05.744 --> 39:07.879
and we both know they were
the last cartel in Mexico

39:07.913 --> 39:10.215
that was willing to supply you.

39:10.248 --> 39:11.850
And Epi, he's got
the army behind him,

39:11.883 --> 39:14.486
so the Colombians
ain't gonna touch you.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.488
And you're gonna provide
the answer to my troubles.

39:16.522 --> 39:18.189
You do need a new supplier,

39:18.223 --> 39:20.426
somebody who's not afraid
of Epi or the Colombians,

39:20.459 --> 39:22.561
and I can connect you with one.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.162
Well, you can save your breath.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.864
I don't do business
with the Russians.

39:25.897 --> 39:30.669
The supplier's
not Russian.

39:30.702 --> 39:34.440
It's El Santo.

39:35.106 --> 39:38.710
El Santo is a madman.

39:38.744 --> 39:42.013
He's the last chance you've got.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.416
You need to go to Bolivia.
