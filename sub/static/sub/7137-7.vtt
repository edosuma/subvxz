WEBVTT

01:46.033 --> 01:50.000
- The road to Hell is
paved with good intentions.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.533
Now, there's a mind fuck
if I ever heard one.

01:52.600 --> 01:56.100
The good side of my will
is the road to damnation.

01:56.166 --> 01:58.433
Fuck, why even
try being good?

01:58.500 --> 02:01.066
And if good intentions
take you to the Lake of Fire,

02:01.133 --> 02:02.934
where do
bad intentions lead?

02:04.400 --> 02:06.133
Oz.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.400
- Nino, please,
you don't understand.

02:08.467 --> 02:10.367
I didn't mean it,
I did the best I could.

02:10.433 --> 02:13.600
- Hey, Doc,
Dr. Nathan.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.467
Can't you shut him up?

02:15.533 --> 02:17.567
He blabbed all night,
I couldn't sleep.

02:17.633 --> 02:19.000
- You're well enough
to be discharged.

02:19.066 --> 02:20.467
Transfer Shupe
back to Em City

02:20.533 --> 02:24.033
and give Pancamo five milligrams
of Haldol twice a day.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.600
- Hey, Gloria.
- Hey.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.300
Chucky Pancamo's
delirious.

02:27.367 --> 02:28.333
- So what else is new?

02:28.400 --> 02:29.834
- That's not funny, Tim.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.600
- Hey, the paperwork
said that Augustus Hill

02:31.667 --> 02:32.600
was being transferred
back here today.

02:32.667 --> 02:33.867
I'd don't see him.

02:33.934 --> 02:34.900
- Yeah, he's still
in pretty bad shape.

02:34.967 --> 02:35.900
I put him
in a private room.

02:35.967 --> 02:36.900
- Okay, thanks.

02:40.066 --> 02:42.734
How you feeling?
- Like shit.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.734
- Yeah, you came pretty close
to killing yourself.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.133
You wanna
tell me why?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.767
- I wasn't trying
to kill myself.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.734
- You had massive amounts
of heroin in your system,

02:49.800 --> 02:51.800
which made you get a little
sloppy with your catheter

02:51.867 --> 02:54.233
which resulted
in renal failure.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.700
You may not have been trying
to consciously kill yourself,

02:57.767 --> 03:00.200
but the result was
pretty much the same.

03:00.266 --> 03:02.233
- My mom's died,

03:02.300 --> 03:04.800
wife deserted me.

03:05.967 --> 03:09.133
All of a sudden the walls in Oz
got too high and too thick.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.400
- Augustus,

03:10.467 --> 03:12.567
who gave you
the drugs?

03:12.633 --> 03:14.533
- It don't matter.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.166
- It does to me.

03:16.233 --> 03:17.533
- Look, what I did,
I did.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.100
Ain't nobody else
gonna suffer.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.333
- Salvatore DeSanto is brain
dead from a drug overdose.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.100
I suspect Burr Redding
is responsible.

03:25.166 --> 03:28.166
I suspect he thinks
DeSanto sold you the drugs.

03:28.233 --> 03:29.734
- He didn't.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.900
- That's all the more reason
for you to tell me who did.

03:31.967 --> 03:33.900
- I want to talk to Burr.

03:33.967 --> 03:34.900
- No.

03:34.967 --> 03:36.467
- McManus, please.

03:36.533 --> 03:37.800
- No.

03:37.867 --> 03:40.233
- You got a message
for Burr Redding,

03:40.300 --> 03:43.133
I'm your AT&T.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.233
Salvatore DeSanto didn't
sell Augustus the drugs.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.000
- What?

03:48.066 --> 03:49.467
Then who did?

03:49.533 --> 03:50.800
- Well, he wouldn't
tell me.

03:50.867 --> 03:52.133
- He'll tell me.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.800
- Why, so you can feed
that  guy LSD?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.867
See, I don't
have any proof,

03:55.934 --> 03:58.166
but I got a feeling you're
the one that fucked DeSanto up,

03:58.233 --> 03:59.700
and I'm not gonna
give you an opportunity

03:59.767 --> 04:01.100
to fuck
someone else up.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.166
Officer!

04:02.233 --> 04:04.000
Escort this
gentleman out.

04:08.700 --> 04:09.767
- Where's Busmalis?

04:09.834 --> 04:10.767
- Why?

04:10.834 --> 04:11.934
What's up?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.033
What's up, man?

04:16.433 --> 04:18.900
- You said DeSanto
sold those drugs to Augustus.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.500
- Yes.
- You lied.

04:20.567 --> 04:21.500
- No.

04:21.567 --> 04:23.033
- Why'd you lie,
Busmalis?

04:23.100 --> 04:25.333
- Well, I...
- Who you protecting?

04:25.400 --> 04:26.800
Guerra?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.333
- Guerra.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.100
Yeah, Guerra
made me lie.

04:31.166 --> 04:32.433
- Why?
- I don't know.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.200
Maybe he sold the drugs
to Augustus.

04:34.266 --> 04:36.367
- All right,
get out of here.

04:38.367 --> 04:40.967
- We need to have a sit-down
with Morales.

04:42.133 --> 04:43.734
Morales...

04:43.800 --> 04:46.500
Did Guerra
give Augustus those drugs?

04:46.567 --> 04:49.400
- No.

04:49.467 --> 04:52.000
- You lying.

04:52.066 --> 04:53.867
- Know what, Redding?

04:53.934 --> 04:55.967
You and me,
since we made peace,

04:56.033 --> 04:58.467
we've had
a good thing going.

04:58.533 --> 05:01.033
Don't blow it
by being an asshole.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.800
- Motherfucker.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.200
Who the fuck you think
you're calling an asshole?

05:05.266 --> 05:06.200
- What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

05:24.033 --> 05:26.700
- John and Jane Doe
decided to go on a diet,

05:26.767 --> 05:29.200
eat better, get healthy,
live longer.

05:29.266 --> 05:30.767
What could
be wrong with that?

05:30.834 --> 05:34.133
Well, studies now show that
the stress John suffers from

05:34.200 --> 05:35.834
trying to lower
his cholesterol

05:35.900 --> 05:37.767
can do as much harm
as cholesterol itself,

05:37.834 --> 05:40.900
that the stress can actually
raise his cholesterol.

05:40.967 --> 05:43.433
And take those low-fat,
no-fat products.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.800
Shit's loaded with sugar
to make it taste better.

05:45.867 --> 05:49.600
So while Jane's trimming down,
she's jacking up her blood sugar

05:49.667 --> 05:51.266
and risking diabetes.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.567
Bottled water.

05:52.633 --> 05:54.467
What the fuck could
be wrong with that?

05:54.533 --> 05:56.100
The bottles,
my friend.

05:56.166 --> 05:59.867
1.5 million tons of plastic
are used for them each year,

05:59.934 --> 06:02.233
which means more toxic gases
in the air we breathe.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.967
So by going all natural,

06:05.033 --> 06:06.533
we're actually
killing ourselves,

06:06.600 --> 06:08.300
killing the whole
fuckin' planet.

06:13.734 --> 06:16.266
- Look at O'Reily,
he's been there all day.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.934
- He's waiting for the
verdict on Cyril's murder trial.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.300
The jury's still
deliberating.

06:22.367 --> 06:23.300
- Think he'll
get convicted?

06:23.367 --> 06:24.567
- I hope not.

06:24.633 --> 06:25.900
I like Cyril.

06:25.967 --> 06:27.967
I'd hate to see him
sent off to death row.

06:28.734 --> 06:32.433
- Ryan, what news?

06:32.500 --> 06:36.433
- Nothing; the lawyer says it
could be a couple of days

06:36.500 --> 06:38.166
before the jury comes back
with a verdict.

06:38.233 --> 06:39.567
I just--
you know,

06:39.633 --> 06:41.467
I just wish I was
with Cyril in solitary,

06:41.533 --> 06:43.033
because I know
he's scared,

06:43.100 --> 06:44.867
and I don't think he's got
a clue as to what's going on.

06:44.934 --> 06:46.033
- Good.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.300
- What's good?

06:47.367 --> 06:49.233
- Well, the less aware
he is of things,

06:49.300 --> 06:52.033
the better chance we have of
overturning a guilty verdict.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.667
- I don't follow--
what?

06:53.734 --> 06:56.367
- I'm not going to
let Cyril die,

06:56.433 --> 06:58.300
not without
one hell of a fight.

06:58.367 --> 06:59.834
- What do you care
about my brother for, huh?

06:59.900 --> 07:01.600
What fuckin' business
is it of yours?

07:01.667 --> 07:03.333
- Just because
I'm a prisoner

07:03.400 --> 07:05.700
doesn't mean I've stopped
being a priest.

07:05.767 --> 07:08.667
Cyril is one of God's kids.
Therefore it's--

07:08.734 --> 07:10.600
- Hey, Meehan, yo, yo,
you know what?

07:10.667 --> 07:12.400
Stay the fuck
away from me, all right?

07:12.467 --> 07:13.600
The last thing
I need right now is hope,

07:13.667 --> 07:15.266
so just fuckin' beat it.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.166
Get the fuck
out of here.

07:18.567 --> 07:20.100
What are you, deaf?

07:23.333 --> 07:24.800
- O'Reily, come with me.

07:24.867 --> 07:26.133
- Where?

07:26.200 --> 07:27.300
- Jury's in.

07:27.367 --> 07:28.400
- Oh, take that.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.066
- Ryan.

07:37.133 --> 07:38.166
- Oh, Christ.

07:38.233 --> 07:39.533
- I'm sorry.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.033
We're going to appeal.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.500
- A lot of fuckin' good
that'll do.

07:44.934 --> 07:48.000
Hey, you okay?

07:48.066 --> 07:49.900
- Sure.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.734
- Kiss Jericho.
- Yeah, Cyril, I--

07:51.800 --> 07:53.900
- Kiss him.
He misses you.

07:57.900 --> 07:58.900
- When's sentencing?

07:58.967 --> 08:00.400
- It's Thursday.

08:00.467 --> 08:04.367
I'll plead for clemency
because of his mental state.

08:04.433 --> 08:05.367
- Don't.

08:05.433 --> 08:06.700
- Why not?
The judge--

08:06.767 --> 08:09.767
- I'm responsible
for his decisions, right?

08:09.834 --> 08:10.800
I say no appeals,

08:10.867 --> 08:13.333
no clemency.

08:16.367 --> 08:17.900
Now leave us alone.

08:26.533 --> 08:28.433
- Is there a problem,
Ryan?

08:28.500 --> 08:30.834
- No...

08:30.900 --> 08:32.467
Just the opposite.

08:35.300 --> 08:36.800
You're getting
out of here, kid.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.467
You're gonna be free.

08:42.867 --> 08:46.100
- Why would you want
your brother to die?

08:46.166 --> 08:47.266
- Look at our lives.

08:47.333 --> 08:49.467
- We were beaten as kids,
ignored,

08:49.533 --> 08:51.834
in and out of juvie
all the time.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.567
Then Cyril gets his brains
smashed in,

08:54.633 --> 08:57.800
and we're stuck in this shithole
for the next 90 years.

08:57.867 --> 08:59.500
- Nothingness

08:59.567 --> 09:02.433
is better
than a lifetime in Oz.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.233
- Once he's gone,
he's gone forever,

09:04.300 --> 09:06.734
and you will have to live
every day with the part

09:06.800 --> 09:08.100
you played in that.

09:08.166 --> 09:10.100
- Believe me, I accept
everything I've done

09:10.166 --> 09:11.633
to screw up
Cyril's life.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.233
I can carry this.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.300
- No.

09:14.367 --> 09:15.500
No, you won't
be able to.

09:15.567 --> 09:16.967
- And what makes you
say that?

09:17.033 --> 09:18.500
- Because I know you,
Ryan.

09:18.567 --> 09:19.867
- What?

09:19.934 --> 09:21.400
You think you know me?

09:21.467 --> 09:22.867
Because we sit around
and we jaw,

09:22.934 --> 09:24.400
you got me
all figured out?

09:24.467 --> 09:25.767
Is that it, huh?

09:25.834 --> 09:27.467
Well, let me
tell you something, Ma,

09:27.533 --> 09:30.266
even if you'd been
in that house my whole life,

09:30.333 --> 09:31.533
you wouldn't have

09:31.600 --> 09:33.166
a fuckin' clue
who I am!

09:35.400 --> 09:36.600
- Ryan.

09:36.667 --> 09:37.600
- Let me out of here.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.433
- Ryan?

09:40.367 --> 09:42.300
- The only way
to win this case on appeal

09:42.367 --> 09:44.000
is in the court
of public opinion.

09:44.066 --> 09:45.867
- In 1989, the Supreme Court
ruled that executing

09:45.934 --> 09:48.433
the mentally retarded
was not a violation

09:48.500 --> 09:49.934
of the Eighth Amendment,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.400
because there's no
national consensus

09:51.467 --> 09:52.934
against such punishment.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.934
- So we have to demonstrate
in court now

09:55.000 --> 09:56.567
that there is
a consensus

09:56.633 --> 09:59.100
that even Americans who
believe in the death penalty

09:59.166 --> 10:01.233
find these
particular executions

10:01.300 --> 10:03.834
to be cruel
and unusual punishment.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.400
- We need to get
the media aroused.

10:05.467 --> 10:07.333
- Sister, can you get out
a press release

10:07.400 --> 10:09.467
to the effect that
it's impossible to determine

10:09.533 --> 10:11.600
the extent of Cyril's
culpability?

10:11.667 --> 10:14.000
I mean, he knew he did
something wrong, but he--

10:14.066 --> 10:15.934
he has no sense
of the gravity.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.767
- Okay, but a press release
isn't enough.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.166
We should hold
a press conference.

10:19.233 --> 10:21.033
I want to make it clear
that I was never able

10:21.100 --> 10:22.767
to discuss the specifics
of the case with Cyril,

10:22.834 --> 10:25.433
that he did not actively
participate in his own defense.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.767
- Father Meehan...

10:26.834 --> 10:28.834
Do you really think
we can pull this off?

10:28.900 --> 10:31.500
- The law is like
God Almighty himself,

10:31.567 --> 10:33.166
it moves
in strange ways,

10:33.233 --> 10:36.934
so we have to keep nudging it
toward a more merciful outcome.

10:40.367 --> 10:43.066
- Hey, everybody,
check it out, Shupe's back.

10:43.133 --> 10:44.066
Let's give him a hand.

10:46.734 --> 10:48.667
- You're a regular
Chris Rock there, O'Reily.

10:48.734 --> 10:50.166
- What can I say?
It's a talent.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.333
- Speaking of talents,
you made a deal with us.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.934
We'd hurt Shupe if
you'd airhole Jia Kenmin.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.967
- Well, I never said
I'd do the deed myself.

10:57.033 --> 10:59.767
- I'm gonna find someone to do
it who the COs can't blame.

10:59.834 --> 11:01.100
- Who?

11:01.166 --> 11:03.333
- The COs themselves.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.700
- I hear justice
has been served.

11:21.767 --> 11:26.200
Your brother's gonna die
for whacking Li Chen.

11:26.266 --> 11:27.567
My only wish...

11:27.633 --> 11:30.433
is that you'd been in court
the day I testified.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.934
Li Chen,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.266
he was a good man
who wouldn't hurt a flea.

11:35.333 --> 11:38.600
I even choked back
a fuckin' tear.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.033
I was brilliant.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.333
- Hey, Wonton.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.233
- Get off him.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.900
Get off him now.

11:55.467 --> 11:56.934
- Fuckin' cocksucker.
- Back off.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.800
- Son of a bitch!

12:18.567 --> 12:20.200
- You're gonna
be fine.

12:22.567 --> 12:23.600
How you feeling?

12:23.667 --> 12:25.100
- Sore.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.300
How's Jia?

12:26.367 --> 12:27.934
- I didn't even
get to see him.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.600
The COs threw him
directly into solitary.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.300
- It's not nice
to hit the hacks.

12:31.367 --> 12:32.900
- Well, given his
previous concussion,

12:32.967 --> 12:33.967
I'm a little
worried.

12:34.033 --> 12:35.333
- Don't be.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.367
It's better for all of us
if Jia goes back

12:36.433 --> 12:38.400
into another coma.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.166
- I'll get someone
to take you back.

12:40.233 --> 12:41.600
- I'll take him.

12:43.934 --> 12:45.433
Appreciate what you
did today, O'Reily.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.567
- If you guys hadn't
gotten there when you did,

12:47.633 --> 12:49.600
that Chink would've
snapped my fuckin' neck.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.000
I was just
returning the favor.

12:51.066 --> 12:53.600
Yeah, Jia, man,
he's got some set of balls.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.567
He's always talking about
what pussies you hacks are.

12:55.633 --> 12:56.633
- Yeah?

12:56.700 --> 12:59.066
Well, he's got
a lesson coming.

12:59.133 --> 13:00.166
He'll learn.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.100
Hey, Jia.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.166
How's the head?

13:13.233 --> 13:15.600
- Fuck you.

13:15.667 --> 13:18.867
- See, I would call that
an act of aggression.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.633
- Ow, Jesus!

13:36.700 --> 13:38.900
- You happy with
what you did?

13:38.967 --> 13:40.300
- What'd I do?

13:40.367 --> 13:43.467
- Got your revenge
on Jia Kenmin.

13:43.533 --> 13:44.633
- That motherfucker
came at me.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.667
- I saw otherwise.

13:46.734 --> 13:49.300
- Hey, keep your
fuckin' mouth shut.

13:50.633 --> 13:52.467
- You wear that
cross of gold.

13:52.533 --> 13:53.600
Why?

13:53.667 --> 13:55.467
Do you believe
in the Risen Christ,

13:55.533 --> 13:57.433
or is it
just a bobble?

13:57.500 --> 14:01.133
What happened to you
when you were a child?

14:01.200 --> 14:03.233
What made you walk away
from the church?

14:03.300 --> 14:04.600
- I didn't walk away.

14:04.667 --> 14:05.800
I ran.

14:05.867 --> 14:08.567
- Why?

14:08.633 --> 14:09.834
- When I was a kid

14:09.900 --> 14:13.000
and all this shit was
going down in our house,

14:13.066 --> 14:14.633
my dad was wailing
on us non-stop,

14:14.700 --> 14:17.400
so I went
to our pastor.

14:17.467 --> 14:20.433
I had a welt on my back
the size of this fist,

14:20.500 --> 14:23.367
so I asked the good Monsignor
if he could please

14:23.433 --> 14:26.467
talk to my dad and ask him
to stop beating on us.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.600
He said if my dad hit us,
it was because we were bad

14:29.667 --> 14:32.367
and we deserved
to be punished.

14:32.433 --> 14:33.500
Then he told me
to go home

14:33.567 --> 14:37.133
and "honor thy father".

14:37.200 --> 14:39.734
- There are bad priests,

14:39.800 --> 14:42.367
but there are lots
of good ones too.

14:42.433 --> 14:46.400
Your priest wasn't there
for you, but I am.

14:46.467 --> 14:48.433
I'm here for you,

14:48.500 --> 14:51.200
and I'm here
for your brother.

14:53.533 --> 14:56.066
- No, it's too late,
Father.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.600
It's too
fuckin' late.

15:04.166 --> 15:07.100
- John and Jane Doe,
both looking slim and sexy,

15:07.166 --> 15:10.133
meet, fall in love,
decide to get married.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.266
John buys a nice fat diamond
for Jane's finger.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.633
Sweet,

15:14.700 --> 15:17.033
except for the fact
that people in Africa

15:17.100 --> 15:19.633
are living in shit because of
those precious little stones.

15:19.700 --> 15:22.100
Men are dying every day
in dangerous mines.

15:22.166 --> 15:24.467
Men are dying every day
in civil wars

15:24.533 --> 15:26.767
fought to control
the diamond trades.

15:26.834 --> 15:27.834
Anyway...

15:27.900 --> 15:29.767
John and Jane
get married,

15:29.834 --> 15:31.400
start pumping out
the kids.

15:31.467 --> 15:32.934
Shit, even God told
Adam and Eve

15:33.000 --> 15:34.333
to be fruitful
and multiply,

15:34.400 --> 15:37.100
but now we've multiplied
to the point of plague,

15:37.166 --> 15:39.867
6 billion
and counting.

15:39.934 --> 15:43.467
Suddenly, my cell
don't seem so cramped.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.500
- I don't know how
I'm gonna give Julie up.

15:46.567 --> 15:48.000
Huh?

15:48.066 --> 15:49.967
I had a kid once,

15:50.033 --> 15:51.734
died.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.533
It fuckin'
nearly crippled me.

15:54.600 --> 15:58.367
I ain't felt love
since then...

15:58.433 --> 15:59.834
until now.

16:00.767 --> 16:03.033
- You know that CO
that you blinded?

16:03.100 --> 16:04.233
- Eugene Rivera?

16:04.300 --> 16:05.533
- Yeah, is he gonna
get your dog?

16:05.600 --> 16:06.734
- Well...

16:06.800 --> 16:08.467
He said he don't
want any part of anything

16:08.533 --> 16:10.767
that had
to do with me.

16:10.834 --> 16:13.900
- Have you ever seen these
babies fight for sport?

16:14.967 --> 16:15.934
- I've seen roosters.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.633
I haven't
seen dogs, though.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.467
- It's fuckin' brutal,
man.

16:19.533 --> 16:22.266
Three rounds of
absolute mayhem.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.300
Dogs are just rippin'
each other apart.

16:24.367 --> 16:26.300
- Jesus Christ,
fuckin' stop!

16:26.367 --> 16:28.300
I'm sorry.

16:36.567 --> 16:38.200
- Hey, Penders,
Alvarez,

16:38.266 --> 16:39.734
what's this?

16:41.900 --> 16:43.333
- Beats me.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.500
- It's dog shit,
dickhead.

16:45.567 --> 16:48.734
- How can you be sure
that a dog did that?

16:48.800 --> 16:51.100
- Who else shits
on the floor?

16:51.166 --> 16:52.934
- Guerra.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.066
- That's funny.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.066
Clean it up.

16:55.133 --> 16:56.266
- No.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.600
- No?
- No.

16:57.667 --> 17:00.667
- Clean the fuckin'
shit up.

17:00.734 --> 17:03.033
- Lopresti, why you always
on my fuckin' ass?

17:03.100 --> 17:06.033
- Because I'm tired of you
and your fuckin' pooch.

17:06.100 --> 17:07.867
- At least Chester
doesn't have bad breath.

17:12.433 --> 17:13.633
men: Ohh!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.500
- Shit.

17:17.767 --> 17:19.033
- Chester, now,
Chester!

17:29.633 --> 17:32.133
- Yes. Yes, Chester.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.233
- Damn!

17:37.300 --> 17:38.567
- It's a shame
what Penders did,

17:38.633 --> 17:40.033
teaching Chester
to attack.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.934
He put a shadow
over the whole program.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.633
- Yeah, you know,
he really loved the dog.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.000
He just
fuckin' hates people.

17:48.066 --> 17:50.000
- Let her take you
up the stairs.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.734
- What else?

17:58.800 --> 18:00.100
- Have her sit.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.567
- Julie, sit.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.433
Good girl, and?

18:06.500 --> 18:08.900
- Now take off
your blindfold.

18:11.767 --> 18:12.867
- I pass?

18:12.934 --> 18:14.767
- Yes, A+,

18:14.834 --> 18:17.300
gold star,
great job.

18:17.367 --> 18:20.100
- Thanks, she did
all the work, you know?

18:20.166 --> 18:23.734
- And she'll continue
to do so, thanks to you.

18:25.834 --> 18:28.567
- You know what I wish?

18:28.633 --> 18:30.033
I wish I could
just see

18:30.100 --> 18:31.533
whoever's gonna
get her, you know?

18:31.600 --> 18:34.133
- Well, Miguel...

18:34.200 --> 18:36.834
You're gonna
get your wish,

18:36.900 --> 18:39.300
because that person is gonna
be here in just a second.

18:39.367 --> 18:40.867
- Who's that?

18:40.934 --> 18:43.900
- McManus has been working
the phones all morning, and--

18:46.066 --> 18:47.867
- Oh, shit.

18:47.934 --> 18:49.700
I thought
he didn't want her.

18:49.767 --> 18:52.000
- Tina didn't.

18:52.066 --> 18:54.467
Well, neither did I
at first.

18:55.900 --> 18:59.066
Look, I love my wife

18:59.133 --> 19:01.734
and everything
she's done for me,

19:01.800 --> 19:03.633
but she deserves
her life back.

19:03.700 --> 19:07.734
I mean, I know this dog
would be great for me,

19:07.800 --> 19:10.133
but I think...

19:10.200 --> 19:12.633
Over time it would
be great for her too.

19:12.700 --> 19:13.800
- That's good.

19:13.867 --> 19:15.800
Cool.

19:15.867 --> 19:18.166
This is Julie,

19:18.233 --> 19:20.000
and I trained her
special for you, man.

19:20.066 --> 19:21.934
- Special?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.967
- What do you normally
speak at home?

19:24.033 --> 19:25.567
- Spanish.

19:25.633 --> 19:28.100
- Now make believe
you're at home right now

19:28.166 --> 19:29.200
and ask for her.

19:29.266 --> 19:30.900
- Julie?

19:30.967 --> 19:32.734
Ven aca.

19:36.066 --> 19:37.800
- You taught the dog
Spanish?

19:37.867 --> 19:39.200
- Yeah, yeah.

19:39.266 --> 19:42.700
Every command,
she's fuckin' bilingual.

19:42.767 --> 19:45.433
Tell her to sit down.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.967
- Julie...

19:47.033 --> 19:49.000
Sientate.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.033
- She's all yours.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.834
Te voy a echar de manos.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.066
- Come on,
I'll drive you home.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.667
- Let's go.

20:25.633 --> 20:27.500
- Well, congratulations, Tim,
you're two for two.

20:27.567 --> 20:30.266
Both the music program
and the man's best friend

20:30.333 --> 20:32.467
has had tangible
and positive results.

20:32.533 --> 20:33.567
- Hear, hear!

20:33.633 --> 20:34.767
- Thank you.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.033
You know, I just want
to tell you both

20:36.100 --> 20:37.367
that I appreciate
your support,

20:37.433 --> 20:40.066
as guarded and as
half-ass as it's been.

20:40.133 --> 20:41.800
- Ouch.

20:41.867 --> 20:44.800
I was wondering what happened
to that backhand of yours.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.834
Oh, I gotta go.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.567
I'm due over
at Lardner.

20:49.633 --> 20:52.000
Leo, Timmy.

20:56.433 --> 20:57.867
- Well...

20:57.934 --> 21:00.166
There certainly has been
a thaw in your icy relationship

21:00.233 --> 21:01.567
with the governor's office.

21:01.633 --> 21:02.734
- Huh?

21:02.800 --> 21:04.133
- If I didn't know better,

21:04.200 --> 21:06.533
I'd say you had a liaison
with the state liaison,

21:06.600 --> 21:08.800
if not last night,
then very recently.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.200
- Yeah, I gotta go too.

21:11.266 --> 21:13.100
- Okay, Timmy.

21:17.967 --> 21:19.867
- 51.

21:20.667 --> 21:24.133
- Yeah, Jesus Christ,
I fucking won!

21:24.200 --> 21:27.033
- That winning
ticket was mine, damn it!

21:27.100 --> 21:28.467
Have I got
any legal recourse?

21:28.533 --> 21:29.533
- No, no.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.900
I mean, even if
we could find him,

21:30.967 --> 21:33.433
it's Dave Brass' word
against yours.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.200
I mean, he's a CO injured
in the line of duty,

21:36.266 --> 21:38.867
you, a prisoner,
known to talk to God.

21:38.934 --> 21:41.533
- That bastard!

21:41.600 --> 21:43.834
He should be arrested
for killing my grandson.

21:43.900 --> 21:47.266
- Alex Jr.'s only chance to beat
the leukemia is to find a donor,

21:47.333 --> 21:48.967
someone willing
to give his bone marrow.

21:49.033 --> 21:50.233
- I know.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.700
But I thought because of
his unique ethnic mix,

21:52.767 --> 21:54.066
a match was difficult.

21:54.133 --> 21:56.333
- The difficulty is
that no one is looking.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.967
There must be
someone out there.

21:58.033 --> 21:59.300
- Or here.

21:59.367 --> 22:00.800
I'll bet if you
search the computer files

22:00.867 --> 22:02.867
of every prisoner in Oz,
past or present,

22:02.934 --> 22:05.734
you'd get a match.

22:05.800 --> 22:06.734
- Well, why don't I?

22:06.800 --> 22:08.000
- What?

22:08.066 --> 22:10.567
- Search the files.

22:10.633 --> 22:11.867
- You'd do that for me?

22:11.934 --> 22:12.967
- For you,

22:13.033 --> 22:14.533
for your grandson,

22:14.600 --> 22:15.633
for Dave Brass,

22:15.700 --> 22:16.967
for my own
peace of mind.

22:21.066 --> 22:23.667
- Martinez.

22:23.734 --> 22:25.633
I hear they're shipping your ass
back to solitary.

22:25.700 --> 22:26.800
- Yeah.

22:26.867 --> 22:30.300
- Listen, I could
help you out.

22:30.367 --> 22:32.800
A word from me
and you're sitting in Unit B,

22:32.867 --> 22:34.367
maybe even
Emerald City.

22:34.433 --> 22:35.667
- Yeah?

22:35.734 --> 22:37.567
And why would
you help me?

22:39.300 --> 22:42.066
- You douced Dave Brass
for no apparent reason.

22:42.133 --> 22:44.867
Only I'm thinking
you had a reason,

22:44.934 --> 22:47.400
and I'm thinking
if you tell me,

22:47.467 --> 22:50.000
that's maybe when
I can step up for you.

22:52.133 --> 22:54.834
- I got nothing to say.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.500
- You attacked a CO,
Carlos.

22:56.567 --> 22:58.734
Where you're going,
you've got no friends.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.667
- If you don't get smart,

23:01.734 --> 23:05.233
you're gonna fuckin' hurt
a lot more than you do now.

23:12.233 --> 23:14.333
Martinez is cracking.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.867
We're so close to him
jabbering all the names

23:15.934 --> 23:17.900
of everybody involved.

23:17.967 --> 23:20.934
And my guess is
Enrique Morales tops the list.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.066
- Yeah, good, none of that's
gonna do much good

23:23.133 --> 23:24.767
for Rebadow,
though.

23:24.834 --> 23:26.967
I mean, even if we find Brass
and tell him who cut him,

23:27.033 --> 23:29.900
he's not going to give
that lottery money back.

23:31.734 --> 23:34.367
Yes.

23:34.433 --> 23:35.734
Yes, yes.

23:35.800 --> 23:36.734
Got it.

23:36.800 --> 23:37.734
- Got what?

23:37.800 --> 23:39.900
- Salvation.

23:43.266 --> 23:46.300
Farai Gyrobile is
a Rastafarian from Unit C.

23:46.367 --> 23:47.934
Now, it turns out
that him and Bob Marley

23:48.000 --> 23:49.734
have more in common
than just reggae.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.467
Both of them
have white fathers.

23:51.533 --> 23:53.667
- And was his mother
half West Indian,

23:53.734 --> 23:54.667
half Guatemalan?

23:54.734 --> 23:55.967
- Yeah, so he appears to be

23:56.033 --> 23:57.533
the perfect match
for your grandson.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.400
Now all you've gotta do
is convince him

24:00.467 --> 24:01.734
to be the bone marrow
donor.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.800
- May I talk
to this man alone,

24:04.867 --> 24:07.233
prisoner to prisoner?

24:07.300 --> 24:08.333
- Of course.

24:10.800 --> 24:11.867
Good luck.

24:16.700 --> 24:20.633
- Farai,
Bob.

24:20.700 --> 24:21.934
Bob Rebadow.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.233
- The guy who got aced

24:23.300 --> 24:25.166
out of the 2 million
Mightyball dollars.

24:25.233 --> 24:27.333
- Yes, you see...

24:27.400 --> 24:29.500
I needed to win that money
on account of my grandson.

24:29.567 --> 24:32.567
He's dying
of leukemia.

24:32.633 --> 24:34.700
- Pity.

24:34.767 --> 24:37.533
- Which is why
I need your help.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.433
Alex has a...

24:39.500 --> 24:43.667
Very specific racial makeup
which you match exactly.

24:43.734 --> 24:45.767
- How the fuck you know
what makes me up?

24:45.834 --> 24:47.166
- McManus told me.

24:47.233 --> 24:49.767
And I was hoping
you might be willing

24:49.834 --> 24:52.400
to donate your bone marrow
to my grandson.

24:52.467 --> 24:56.233
- McManus has no right
sharing that shit with you!

24:56.300 --> 24:59.300
Everyone here thinks my blood
be black, 100%.

24:59.367 --> 25:00.834
I fuckin' donate,

25:00.900 --> 25:03.066
and they all
know different.

25:03.133 --> 25:05.800
And if you tell a soul,

25:05.867 --> 25:07.934
you're as dead
as your grandboy.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.333
- No, wait.

25:22.166 --> 25:24.100
- I'm sorry, Alex.

25:24.166 --> 25:26.333
I tried.

25:39.300 --> 25:41.667
God spoke to me
last night.

25:41.734 --> 25:43.600
- He told me that
the missing element

25:43.667 --> 25:47.567
in Alex Jr.'s recovery
is faith.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.867
- Uh-huh.

25:49.934 --> 25:51.834
- Not money,
not science.

25:51.900 --> 25:53.633
I want to find
a faith healer,

25:53.700 --> 25:56.433
someone who will go
to my grandson in the hospital,

25:56.500 --> 25:58.000
lay hands on him,

25:58.066 --> 26:00.567
flush out the leukemia
once and for all.

26:00.633 --> 26:03.100
- I see.

26:03.166 --> 26:04.834
- You're wary.

26:04.900 --> 26:06.900
- What little I do know
of faith healers

26:06.967 --> 26:08.700
gives me pause.

26:08.767 --> 26:11.133
A lot of people
expecting a miracle...

26:11.200 --> 26:13.700
get deception instead.

26:13.767 --> 26:15.133
- Okay.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.367
So you don't
choose the bruised fruit.

26:17.433 --> 26:18.967
You look carefully.

26:19.033 --> 26:20.300
- For whatever
it's worth,

26:20.367 --> 26:21.867
the kind of people
you're talking about

26:21.934 --> 26:25.667
are not typically
sanctioned by any church.

26:25.734 --> 26:27.667
- Sister Pete,

26:27.734 --> 26:29.367
I didn't say
religious healer,

26:29.433 --> 26:31.100
denominational healer.

26:31.166 --> 26:33.767
I said faith healer,
the faith that

26:33.834 --> 26:36.767
alone transcends all
cultural divisions and systems.

26:36.834 --> 26:38.500
Aren't you sick of
the club mentality

26:38.567 --> 26:41.033
surrounded by members
of other clubs,

26:41.100 --> 26:43.200
who belongs to what

26:43.266 --> 26:45.934
and which one
has the upper hand on God?

26:47.433 --> 26:49.834
I mean no offense,
but I don't want to belong.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.300
I just want
to believe.

26:51.367 --> 26:53.900
- So what happens next?

26:53.967 --> 26:55.633
- I wait for
instructions.

26:55.700 --> 26:58.533
I wait for the word.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.900
I am an arrow
in God's bow.

27:18.533 --> 27:20.333
- How long has he got?

27:20.400 --> 27:21.934
- What?

27:23.233 --> 27:25.266
- Your grandson,

27:25.333 --> 27:26.900
how long has he got?

27:26.967 --> 27:28.233
- Who are you?

27:28.300 --> 27:30.233
- A.R. Whitworth.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.767
How long has he got?

27:32.834 --> 27:34.600
- I don't know,
only God does.

27:34.667 --> 27:37.033
- Good answer.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.300
Now we're talking.

27:38.367 --> 27:39.967
- About what?

27:40.033 --> 27:44.066
- Faith healing,
right?

27:44.133 --> 27:46.233
- How do you know that?

27:46.300 --> 27:47.900
- Would you believe
that last night

27:47.967 --> 27:52.467
I dreamt that your grandson
was restored to perfect health?

27:52.533 --> 27:54.967
- Maybe.

27:55.033 --> 27:59.000
- Go on.
- All right.

27:59.066 --> 28:00.533
I was born a gimp,

28:00.600 --> 28:05.066
spinal shit,
impossible to fix.

28:05.133 --> 28:06.467
When I was
in high school,

28:06.533 --> 28:09.033
found out that my neighbor's
a faith healer,

28:09.100 --> 28:11.700
born with
X-ray vision.

28:11.767 --> 28:15.333
She denied it for years,
said it embarrassed her.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.367
Then she goes
and heals a friend

28:17.433 --> 28:21.100
and the word spreads.

28:21.166 --> 28:26.467
All this time,
right next door to me.

28:26.533 --> 28:27.533
I was pissed off at first,
to tell you the truth.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.467
But she's the real deal.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.567
No showbiz shit.

28:31.633 --> 28:35.266
- But you still
limp a little.

28:35.333 --> 28:37.433
- Just started
bothering me again.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.834
But still, it's better
than what it used to be.

28:41.667 --> 28:45.633
God may hold the key
to your grandson's health,

28:45.700 --> 28:47.767
to heal him,

28:47.834 --> 28:51.333
but he's holding a key
inside the boy.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.900
Regina can turn it.

28:52.967 --> 28:54.934
- Absolutely not.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.600
- Sarah, listen to me.

28:56.667 --> 28:58.166
- I have listened to you.

28:58.233 --> 29:01.033
There will be no strange woman
doing some sort of séance

29:01.100 --> 29:04.300
or voodoo
over Alex Jr.'s bed.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.633
I will not
have it.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.533
- Put aside your prejudices
for a moment,

29:07.600 --> 29:09.333
take Mother
and go meet her.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.834
- No.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.066
There is no way I'm going
to dangle that kind of carrot

29:13.133 --> 29:16.133
in front of a terminally ill
10-year-old.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.800
The boy is
too fragile.

29:17.867 --> 29:20.033
Say it doesn't work,
Robert.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.400
What then?

29:21.467 --> 29:23.600
We tell him that God
didn't love him enough?

29:23.667 --> 29:26.133
- I don't want
little Alex to die.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.233
- We're waiting
and praying

29:28.300 --> 29:30.533
for a bone marrow
transplant.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.533
- Waiting and praying,
waiting and praying.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.967
What about doing,
God damn it?

29:36.033 --> 29:37.767
- Cool down, Rebadow.

29:37.834 --> 29:41.200
- Step back,
this is a family matter.

29:41.266 --> 29:44.667
I want to stand on a mountaintop
and curse our idiotic,

29:44.734 --> 29:48.000
modern small-mindedness,
our lame,

29:48.066 --> 29:50.333
civilized methods
of surviving sickness.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.200
Hospitals are the summit
of human potential?

29:53.266 --> 29:55.133
Bull-fucking-shit!

29:55.200 --> 29:56.300
- Are you finished?

29:56.367 --> 29:57.700
- No.

29:57.767 --> 29:59.633
I'll find someone else
to visit Regina for me.

29:59.700 --> 30:01.133
- Who?

30:01.200 --> 30:04.433
The only reason you called me
instead of Alex or Sophie

30:04.500 --> 30:06.900
or Mother is because you knew
that they would need convincing.

30:06.967 --> 30:09.400
No, there is no one
in our family

30:09.467 --> 30:12.600
who is going to let that strange
woman into Alex Jr.'s room.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.800
- You can't do this.

30:14.867 --> 30:16.200
- Yes, I can.

30:19.633 --> 30:20.734
You know what I see?

30:20.800 --> 30:22.200
I see a man trying
to redeem himself

30:22.266 --> 30:24.633
in the eyes
of his family,

30:24.700 --> 30:29.033
making a last-ditch effort
after decades of absence.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.133
See?

30:30.200 --> 30:33.367
Sometimes I have
X-ray vision too.

30:40.333 --> 30:41.667
- Why?

30:41.734 --> 30:44.600
Why open this door
just to close it in my face?

30:52.500 --> 30:54.000
Be healed...

30:57.066 --> 30:58.500
In the name of God.

31:01.266 --> 31:03.133
- Our Lady of Fatima Church
and its rectory next door

31:03.200 --> 31:04.900
were burned to the ground
this evening,

31:04.967 --> 31:06.500
killing two priests.

31:06.567 --> 31:08.800
Also injured was
Father Raymond Mukada,

31:08.867 --> 31:10.567
who suffered
from smoke inhalation

31:10.633 --> 31:13.300
and is in serious condition
at Benchley Memorial Hospital.

31:13.367 --> 31:14.433
- I don't want
to hear anymore, Seroy.

31:14.500 --> 31:17.066
You're going
to solitary.

31:17.133 --> 31:18.567
- Warden, wait.

31:18.633 --> 31:20.333
What if I give you
some intel?

31:20.400 --> 31:23.100
Will you give me
a reprieve?

31:23.166 --> 31:24.767
- What kind of intel?

31:24.834 --> 31:26.367
- About Father Mukada.

31:26.433 --> 31:28.567
What if I tell you the fire
at Mukada's church

31:28.633 --> 31:29.767
was requested
by a prisoner

31:29.834 --> 31:32.800
here at Oz?

31:32.867 --> 31:34.433
- Who?
- Uh-uh.

31:34.500 --> 31:36.467
Not till
we have a deal.

31:38.166 --> 31:41.433
- Clarence Seroy is
a lying sack of shit.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.800
- Funny, that's what you said
when Jaz Hoyt implicated you

31:43.867 --> 31:45.400
in Jim Burns' murder.

31:45.467 --> 31:46.734
- I'm innocent.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.300
- No, you're a guilty
little prick

31:49.367 --> 31:51.367
who's finally gonna
take responsibility

31:51.433 --> 31:53.934
for the shit storms
you created.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.200
- You've got
no hard-core evidence

31:56.266 --> 31:57.500
that either
I set up the arson

31:57.567 --> 32:00.033
or was involved in
Hoyt killing Burns.

32:00.100 --> 32:03.100
It's still their word
against mine.

32:03.166 --> 32:05.800
- Think you got
the system beat, huh?

32:05.867 --> 32:09.600
Well, I've been around
a lot longer than you, Kirk.

32:09.667 --> 32:12.734
Ray Mukada is
a friend of mine.

32:12.800 --> 32:13.800
He's lying
in a hospital

32:13.867 --> 32:15.767
and that's
pissing me off.

32:15.834 --> 32:18.734
Pissing me off royal.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.667
It's your testimony
vs. Kirk's.

32:26.734 --> 32:29.166
He claims to have had nothing
to do with Burns' murder.

32:29.233 --> 32:30.667
He says you're lying.

32:30.734 --> 32:31.834
- I'm on death row
for chrissake.

32:31.900 --> 32:33.033
Why would I lie?

32:33.100 --> 32:35.567
- What we need
is another witness.

32:35.633 --> 32:37.300
One of your biker buddies
has got to come forward.

32:37.367 --> 32:39.333
- They do that,
they end up here.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.967
- Not necessarily.

32:41.033 --> 32:43.333
If they didn't participate
in the crime,

32:43.400 --> 32:44.400
I give him
a free pass.

32:44.467 --> 32:45.834
All your buddy's
got to say

32:45.900 --> 32:49.133
is he heard Kirk
propose the murder to you.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.133
- Done.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.867
- Timothy Kirk,

33:04.934 --> 33:07.800
you are hereby charged with
the murder of James Burns.

33:07.867 --> 33:09.000
- What?

33:09.066 --> 33:10.867
- My friend Max here
just corroborated

33:10.934 --> 33:13.600
Jaz Hoyt's version
of the truth.

33:13.667 --> 33:15.400
Put Kirk in solitary
until the trial starts.

33:15.467 --> 33:17.533
- No.
- Murder one, death row.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.033
- No, I didn't--

33:19.100 --> 33:21.200
he who comes in with vanity
shall go out in darkness.

33:21.266 --> 33:22.567
I'm sorry.

33:22.633 --> 33:24.567
- And his name shall be
covered in darkness.

33:24.633 --> 33:27.867
He shall
never see the sun.

33:27.934 --> 33:29.233
- No!

33:30.433 --> 33:32.867
- And finally, I'm happy
to announce that Ray Mukada

33:32.934 --> 33:34.633
will be released
from Benchley Memorial

33:34.700 --> 33:35.633
tomorrow afternoon.

33:36.900 --> 33:38.367
- When's he coming
back to work?

33:38.433 --> 33:42.233
- Well, the doctors aren't
sure yet, but we hope soon.

33:42.300 --> 33:43.467
Okay, that's all.

33:45.633 --> 33:47.000
Peter Marie...

33:48.867 --> 33:52.333
You haven't said a word to me
since our little discussion

33:52.400 --> 33:53.500
about Peter Schibetta.

33:53.567 --> 33:56.367
- "Little discussion"?

33:56.433 --> 33:59.333
You know, Leo, when you
decided not to resign,

33:59.400 --> 34:00.467
I was thrilled.

34:00.533 --> 34:01.633
But since then,

34:01.700 --> 34:04.967
you've become
intransigent.

34:05.033 --> 34:06.533
Keller can't
see Beecher,

34:06.600 --> 34:08.967
Schibetta, Alvarez.

34:09.033 --> 34:11.533
It seems like when you get
an attitude about some guy,

34:11.600 --> 34:13.667
boy, you just don't
want to hear anything else.

34:13.734 --> 34:15.533
And I don't
work that way.

34:20.033 --> 34:23.300
- Speaking to Dr. Nathan
really helped me.

34:23.367 --> 34:25.767
Hearing her thoughts about
being raped helped me

34:25.834 --> 34:27.166
to feel not so alone.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.633
- Oh, that's great.

34:28.700 --> 34:29.767
That's good.

34:29.834 --> 34:32.000
- So what's the next step?

34:32.066 --> 34:33.333
- That's up to you.

34:33.400 --> 34:36.166
I would like to schedule
a session with your wife.

34:36.233 --> 34:39.433
- I'm--I'm not ready
to face her yet.

34:39.500 --> 34:40.834
- All right.

34:40.900 --> 34:43.433
And perhaps you should
think about interacting

34:43.500 --> 34:45.667
with the men
who attacked you.

34:45.734 --> 34:47.567
How do you feel
about that?

34:47.633 --> 34:49.233
- No.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.767
No way.

34:50.834 --> 34:52.100
I'm no rat.

34:52.166 --> 34:53.900
I'm not gonna
give up any names.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.834
- Why would you want
to protect them?

34:55.900 --> 34:58.333
- I didn't say
I'm protecting them.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.767
- You're going
to get revenge?

34:59.834 --> 35:01.600
- I didn't say that,
either.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.266
- Peter--
- Just let it go.

35:04.333 --> 35:07.400
- Okay, for now.

35:07.467 --> 35:10.166
I want to ask you
one more thing.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.600
What's your relationship
with Warden Glynn?

35:17.867 --> 35:20.166
So there is bad blood
between you.

35:20.233 --> 35:23.600
- Maybe we need to let
that go too, Sister.

35:23.667 --> 35:24.667
Yeah, let that go too.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.967
- Hey, Petey...

35:40.033 --> 35:41.166
Nice ass.

35:48.667 --> 35:50.433
- John and Jane
raise their kiddies

35:50.500 --> 35:52.266
to be decent citizens,

35:52.333 --> 35:54.333
teach them the laws
of political correctness,

35:54.400 --> 35:55.934
teach them
to respect other races,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.533
genders, body shapes,
beliefs.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.633
But think about it.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.367
Doesn't making our children
too aware of the differences

36:03.433 --> 36:05.400
plant the same seed
of separateness?

36:05.467 --> 36:07.800
Are we blinding
little Jane and John Jr.

36:07.867 --> 36:10.233
so that they only see
what makes us different

36:10.300 --> 36:11.800
and not what
makes us alike?

36:12.934 --> 36:13.967
- Hey...

36:15.367 --> 36:16.667
Feeling better?

36:19.166 --> 36:21.367
Those painkillers are
fuckin' with your brain.

36:21.433 --> 36:23.433
You've been sitting
there for two days.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.967
You don't talk,
you don't eat with us.

36:26.033 --> 36:29.533
Not to mention you got me
worried about this gum shit now.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.834
Can't tell if
they're recessive or not.

36:31.900 --> 36:33.066
- Take a hike, girls.

36:33.133 --> 36:35.467
- Yes, sir.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.000
- Vern.

36:38.066 --> 36:39.166
- Yeah.

36:39.233 --> 36:40.567
- I don't know
who the donor was,

36:40.633 --> 36:43.967
where that fuckin' dentist
got the gum tissue from,

36:44.033 --> 36:46.266
whose cadaver.

36:46.333 --> 36:47.700
Could be anyone's.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.767
- Get the fuck
out of here.

36:55.834 --> 36:57.066
- The shit's anonymous,

36:57.133 --> 37:00.800
stored in some fuckin'
freezer somewhere.

37:00.867 --> 37:03.166
How am I supposed
to know to ask?

37:03.233 --> 37:04.700
Don't look at me
like that.

37:04.767 --> 37:06.533
- When exactly
did this come up?

37:06.600 --> 37:09.433
- When I was whacked on gas
and under the knife.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.000
That scum-sucking
towelhead,

37:12.066 --> 37:14.166
he's fuckin' with me
in the middle of surgery.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.100
- Christ Almighty.

37:17.633 --> 37:21.533
Is it normal color at least,
the gum tissue?

37:21.600 --> 37:23.800
- I don't know.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.367
I haven't looked.

37:25.433 --> 37:26.867
- You haven't looked?

37:26.934 --> 37:28.467
You haven't paid a
little follow-up visit

37:28.533 --> 37:32.000
to Dr. Faraj
to find out?

37:32.066 --> 37:34.133
- He won't be in again
until Thursday.

37:35.567 --> 37:39.900
Listen, nobody
hears about this,

37:39.967 --> 37:41.667
especially not
in the Brotherhood.

38:00.533 --> 38:02.667
- So, Vern, am I right
in deducing

38:02.734 --> 38:04.834
that the reason
I drove 80 miles

38:04.900 --> 38:06.367
to hear this
pathetic story

38:06.433 --> 38:10.367
is because you don't know
what effect James Robson's

38:10.433 --> 38:12.000
little dental dilemma
is going to have

38:12.066 --> 38:13.834
on his standing
in the Brotherhood?

38:13.900 --> 38:15.166
- Yes, sir.

38:15.233 --> 38:18.233
- And because you care
about this Robson,

38:18.300 --> 38:19.633
he's your friend.

38:19.700 --> 38:21.100
- Yes, sir.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.600
- Well, let's see
if you can answer

38:22.667 --> 38:24.567
some of your
own questions here,

38:24.633 --> 38:27.867
and we'll see if my trip
was worth the time.

38:27.934 --> 38:31.000
Define purity
for me, Vern.

38:34.967 --> 38:38.200
You see, I'm not concerned
about James Robson.

38:38.266 --> 38:40.600
I never did care
much for the boy.

38:40.667 --> 38:42.367
His type joins us

38:42.433 --> 38:44.667
more out of
an identity crisis

38:44.734 --> 38:46.600
than true faith.

38:46.667 --> 38:48.533
- Sir, with all
due respect,

38:48.600 --> 38:50.000
Robson has
proven himself.

38:50.066 --> 38:53.400
- With all due respect,
Vern, I don't give a shit.

38:53.467 --> 38:56.533
What does concern me is you,
that your convictions

38:56.600 --> 38:59.266
will falter in this
embarrassing situation,

38:59.333 --> 39:02.100
that you will overlook
Robson's infection

39:02.166 --> 39:03.834
because the two
of you are...

39:03.900 --> 39:05.567
close.

39:05.633 --> 39:07.633
- We don't know
anything for sure yet.

39:07.700 --> 39:10.033
Robson's gonna find out
the truth as soon as he can.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.300
- Just remember,

39:12.367 --> 39:15.266
a little leaven
leavens the whole loaf.

39:15.333 --> 39:17.667
That goes
for you as well.

39:17.734 --> 39:19.233
And next time,

39:19.300 --> 39:20.467
spare me the road trip.

39:20.533 --> 39:21.667
Use the fuckin'
telephone.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.433
- Yo, by the way,

39:25.500 --> 39:28.200
I got James Robson
over in Unit B.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.400
Last night he was asking me
if I can get him a copy

39:30.467 --> 39:32.200
of your schedule
this week.

39:32.266 --> 39:34.166
There...

39:34.233 --> 39:36.133
some sort of nastiness
going on between you two?

39:36.200 --> 39:38.066
- What did he say?

39:38.133 --> 39:39.100
- Nothing.

39:39.166 --> 39:40.600
He was just
all on edge,

39:40.667 --> 39:42.934
in a darker mood
than most days.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.767
You look kind of
freaked out yourself.

39:48.033 --> 39:49.600
- Shit.

39:49.667 --> 39:52.734
Shit, shit, shit.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.333
- Quitting?

39:56.400 --> 39:57.333
As of when?

39:57.400 --> 39:59.166
- Today.
- Today?

39:59.233 --> 40:00.500
Jesus, Tariq

40:00.567 --> 40:02.333
a little advanced notice
would have been nice.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.133
- Leo, I didn't
see it coming, really.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.467
- You can't give me the rest of
the week to fill your slot?

40:06.533 --> 40:08.033
- Look, I'll finish
out my shift,

40:08.100 --> 40:10.166
and then that's all.

40:10.233 --> 40:11.900
Here, these are
some contacts

40:11.967 --> 40:13.633
that could probably
help you out.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.200
- First Cochern,
now you.

40:15.266 --> 40:16.767
Why can't I hold onto
a dentist around here?

40:16.834 --> 40:17.967
- I'm sorry, Leo.

40:18.033 --> 40:19.900
- Bullshit!

40:20.200 --> 40:21.667
- Yeah, I guess so.

40:32.166 --> 40:33.967
Do me a favor.

40:39.200 --> 40:42.967
Spread that around.

40:43.033 --> 40:44.800
And don't tell anyone
where you heard it,

40:44.867 --> 40:45.800
okay?

40:50.333 --> 40:52.000
- Faraj should
be in by now.

40:52.066 --> 40:55.300
I'm gonna corner
him after lunch.

40:55.367 --> 40:56.633
I guess you don't wanna
talk much until then,

40:56.700 --> 40:57.967
is that the deal?

40:58.033 --> 40:59.834
- Hey, I'm not handling
this any different

40:59.900 --> 41:01.200
than the next guy would,

41:01.266 --> 41:02.433
so just give me
a fuckin' break, all right?

41:04.667 --> 41:05.867
- Just soup.

41:05.934 --> 41:06.867
- Sure you don't want no
chitlins and gravy

41:06.934 --> 41:07.867
to go with
that?

41:09.734 --> 41:11.967
- What?

41:12.033 --> 41:12.967
- Shall we?

41:17.367 --> 41:19.133
Everyone, listen up.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.600
Robson here
went to the dentist

41:20.667 --> 41:23.834
and got himself a nice pair
of dirty ghetto gums.

41:33.400 --> 41:34.633
- Thanks, Vern.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.467
- I didn't
say a fuckin' word.

41:36.533 --> 41:37.567
Shut up,
you goddamn nigger.

41:37.633 --> 41:38.967
Just give him
some soup.

41:39.033 --> 41:40.400
- Whoa, you gonna
take that, G,

41:40.467 --> 41:43.300
man calling your brother
a nigger and all?

41:43.367 --> 41:44.900
Hey, don't get stupid.

41:44.967 --> 41:47.133
Don't want me to Sammy Sosa
that jaw with this here spoon.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.000
- Keep it moving, girls.

41:53.433 --> 41:54.767
- I need to see
Dr. Faraj.

41:54.834 --> 41:56.033
My mouth
is killing me.

41:56.100 --> 41:57.667
- You poor baby.

41:57.734 --> 41:58.667
- Follow me.

42:08.600 --> 42:11.100
- Dr. Faraj, hi.

42:13.967 --> 42:15.667
Now, who's the fuckin'
donor, huh?

42:15.734 --> 42:16.734
- I have a wife.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.300
I have kids, please.

42:18.367 --> 42:20.100
- Don't make me
fuckin' slip.

42:20.166 --> 42:21.467
- No, no, he was white.

42:21.533 --> 42:23.700
He was like you, man.
He was just your age.

42:25.467 --> 42:26.433
- Prove it.

42:26.500 --> 42:27.533
Call the fuckin' lab
or whatever.

42:27.600 --> 42:28.567
- I'll prove it.
I'll prove it.

42:28.633 --> 42:29.667
Okay, just please
go get--

42:29.734 --> 42:31.767
get me my address book
from--

42:31.834 --> 42:32.900
from other there, okay?

42:36.967 --> 42:38.734
- He wasn't white,
I made sure of that.

42:38.800 --> 42:40.133
- Fuck!

42:40.200 --> 42:41.467
- What's done is done.

42:41.533 --> 42:44.767
Officer!

42:44.834 --> 42:46.867
He attacked me.

42:46.934 --> 42:49.600
Must be his gums
acting up.

42:59.834 --> 43:04.033
- Now, you all know
how highly I've esteemed...

43:04.100 --> 43:06.500
James Robson,

43:06.567 --> 43:09.033
but the past,
unfortunately,

43:09.100 --> 43:11.800
is nothing more
than the past.

43:12.900 --> 43:15.066
Satan has scored
a very ugly victory,

43:15.133 --> 43:17.934
and it pains me that
Robson is a casualty.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.567
We must, nevertheless,
abide by our principles,

43:21.633 --> 43:23.300
not our feelings.

43:23.367 --> 43:24.734
As of today,

43:24.800 --> 43:26.967
James Robson is no longer
a part of the Brotherhood.

43:42.166 --> 43:43.400
- Hello, Chris.

43:43.467 --> 43:44.900
- Sister.

43:44.967 --> 43:46.533
You're gonna have to
talk in this ear.

43:46.600 --> 43:48.200
This other one doesn't
work too good anymore.

43:48.266 --> 43:50.367
- Yeah, Dr. Nathan
says the hearing loss

43:50.433 --> 43:51.934
may be permanent.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.367
- Eh, that'll give me a real
excuse for ignoring people.

43:56.433 --> 43:57.767
- She also says
you'll be sent back

43:57.834 --> 44:00.367
to protective
custody tomorrow.

44:00.433 --> 44:02.900
- Just in time
for my trial.

44:02.967 --> 44:04.767
- How do you
like your new lawyer?

44:04.834 --> 44:06.633
- I think I'm gonna lose.

44:09.100 --> 44:10.934
- How do you
feel about that?

44:11.000 --> 44:13.367
- Angry.

44:13.433 --> 44:15.867
I don't wanna end my days
on death row.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.700
- I'll pray for you.

44:21.567 --> 44:23.734
- Do you think
Jesus was a fag?

44:23.800 --> 44:24.767
- What?

44:24.834 --> 44:26.400
- You think Jesus
was a fag?

44:26.467 --> 44:27.967
It's a legitimate
question.

44:28.033 --> 44:29.734
- Are you trying
to provoke me,

44:29.800 --> 44:31.100
mock my religion?

44:31.166 --> 44:34.667
- No, just looking
for a role model.

44:34.734 --> 44:37.266
Jesus was divine

44:37.333 --> 44:39.400
and human,
simultaneously, right?

44:41.533 --> 44:45.400
Did the divine part
control his sexual appetites?

44:47.333 --> 44:49.233
And if so,
what chance have I got?

44:49.300 --> 44:50.600
I'm not divine,
far from it.

44:50.667 --> 44:53.166
I mean, all my life,

44:53.233 --> 44:56.533
anytime I've
gotten the urge,

44:56.600 --> 44:59.333
I've stuck my cock
into any cavity

44:59.400 --> 45:02.133
that was open
and available.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.734
That's what's led me
to this point in time,

45:04.800 --> 45:08.433
this precipice of death.

45:08.500 --> 45:09.633
If I'd have
been celibate,

45:09.700 --> 45:11.934
do you think
I'd have been happier?

45:12.000 --> 45:13.834
- We fight our natures,
Chris.

45:13.900 --> 45:15.066
- Why?

45:15.133 --> 45:16.867
God gives us natures,
why?

45:16.934 --> 45:18.166
What, for us
to fight them?

45:18.233 --> 45:23.133
- It proves
we're better than animals.

45:23.200 --> 45:25.367
- I guess I failed
that test.

45:26.867 --> 45:28.166
- You shouldn't
think that way.

45:28.233 --> 45:30.367
- What, sister?
I can't hear you.

45:43.367 --> 45:46.333
- I see the Aryans have
snatched your friend Adam.

45:46.400 --> 45:47.433
- Yeah.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.266
It's my fault.

45:50.333 --> 45:51.266
- How so?

45:51.333 --> 45:53.100
- I...

45:53.166 --> 45:57.233
I don't want to go into
all the gory details, but...

45:57.300 --> 45:59.567
I delivered Adam
into Schillinger's hands.

45:59.633 --> 46:01.166
- Why?

46:01.233 --> 46:04.166
- Because Schillinger could
arrange for me to see Keller.

46:04.233 --> 46:05.367
- Beecher...

46:05.433 --> 46:06.533
- The irony is
I didn't see Keller.

46:06.600 --> 46:07.834
He was sent to
Benchley Memorial

46:07.900 --> 46:09.467
before I could get
to protective custody.

46:09.533 --> 46:12.133
- So to satisfy
your desires,

46:12.200 --> 46:13.934
sexual or otherwise,

46:14.000 --> 46:15.700
you...

46:15.767 --> 46:17.166
sacrificed a boy.

46:17.233 --> 46:19.433
- I was convinced that
Adam deserved to get raped.

46:19.500 --> 46:23.567
You know, he raped that girl,
he attacked me.

46:23.633 --> 46:25.700
But when I saw him
in the gym, I...

46:35.100 --> 46:36.934
I realized that no matter
what Adam had done,

46:37.000 --> 46:38.467
no one deserves that.

46:41.233 --> 46:43.567
My guilt is
devouring me.

46:43.633 --> 46:46.000
- So it should.

46:46.066 --> 46:47.433
- What can I do to make
peace with myself?

46:49.333 --> 46:52.066
Well, I could
tell you,

46:52.133 --> 46:53.533
but you wouldn't
want to hear it.

46:54.433 --> 46:56.367
- Go on.

46:56.967 --> 47:00.934
- This calamity was brought on
by your need to see Keller,

47:01.000 --> 47:02.767
so the only way for you
to punish yourself

47:02.834 --> 47:05.500
is by you denying
yourself Keller.

47:05.567 --> 47:06.500
- You mean
don't see him.

47:06.567 --> 47:10.266
- That's right.

47:10.333 --> 47:12.333
- Ever again?

47:12.400 --> 47:13.633
- That's right.

47:17.266 --> 47:19.800
- Christ.

47:19.867 --> 47:23.867
- If you are
truly sorry, Beecher,

47:23.934 --> 47:24.900
that's what
you must do.

47:26.967 --> 47:28.400
- I want to transfer
to another work detail.

47:28.467 --> 47:33.033
- You transferred to the
mailroom not even a week ago.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.767
- Yeah, I'm not enjoying it
as much as I thought I would.

47:35.834 --> 47:37.233
- Is there trouble
with Schillinger?

47:37.300 --> 47:39.533
- No, I just realized
that pushing a cart around

47:39.600 --> 47:40.867
isn't the best use
of my talents.

47:40.934 --> 47:43.033
- Well, Sister Peter Marie's
already replaced you.

47:43.100 --> 47:44.400
- I know.

47:44.467 --> 47:47.333
- The only opening's
in the women's dress factory.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.066
- Fine.
- So wait a second.

47:49.133 --> 47:51.834
Sewing hems on women's dresses
is a better use of your talent?

47:51.900 --> 47:53.467
Don't fuckin'
bullshit me.

47:53.533 --> 47:54.467
What's going on?

47:54.533 --> 47:55.700
- Nothing.

47:55.767 --> 47:57.834
- All right, all right.

47:57.900 --> 48:00.233
This is a prison,
not an employment agency.

48:00.300 --> 48:01.533
We try
to accommodate people,

48:01.600 --> 48:03.200
but we can't always.

48:03.266 --> 48:06.200
Now, you asked to work
in the mailroom.

48:06.266 --> 48:07.467
Until you give me
a legitimate reason

48:07.533 --> 48:08.500
why you can't,

48:08.567 --> 48:09.500
you stay
in the fuckin' mailroom!

48:09.567 --> 48:10.500
Go!

48:20.667 --> 48:23.300
- I have a special delivery
for Dr. Nathan.

48:59.834 --> 49:00.767
- Can I help you?

49:00.834 --> 49:02.834
- Where's Sister Pete?

49:02.900 --> 49:04.567
- In a staff meeting.

49:04.633 --> 49:06.533
- You're that sheriff
from Unit J, right?

49:06.600 --> 49:08.266
- Alvin Yood, yeah.

49:08.333 --> 49:10.000
- Yeah, I'm Tobias Beecher.

49:10.066 --> 49:11.433
- Hey.

49:11.500 --> 49:12.633
- I used to have this job.

49:12.700 --> 49:14.967
- And you gave it up?

49:15.033 --> 49:17.033
Nothing personal,

49:17.100 --> 49:19.200
but you're a dolt.

49:19.266 --> 49:22.467
- Look, when Sister Pete
gets back from her appointment,

49:22.533 --> 49:25.700
can you give her this note
and tell her to make a meeting

49:25.767 --> 49:27.300
with Adam Guenzel?

49:27.367 --> 49:31.266
He's in Unit B, and I think
he needs somebody to talk to.

49:31.333 --> 49:32.667
- About what?

49:32.734 --> 49:34.633
- She'll know
when she sees him.

49:34.700 --> 49:38.133
- Okay, I'll give her
your message.

49:38.200 --> 49:40.300
- Thanks, so long.

49:41.100 --> 49:44.734
- Hey, Beecher,
don't take any wooden nickels.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.166
- How you doing, Adam?

49:56.233 --> 49:58.767
- What do you care?

49:58.834 --> 50:01.500
- Look, I'm sorry
I let them rape you, okay?

50:01.567 --> 50:04.467
But it's this place,
you know.

50:04.533 --> 50:06.300
It got my head
all fucked up.

50:08.166 --> 50:10.834
Mine too.

50:10.900 --> 50:13.700
- We gotta be there
for each other, bro.

50:13.767 --> 50:14.834
- Why?

50:14.900 --> 50:16.433
You want to borrow
my lipstick.

50:16.500 --> 50:21.166
- Guenzel, Sister Peter Marie
has requested your presence.

50:22.834 --> 50:23.967
- What for?

50:24.033 --> 50:26.266
- My guess: to Saran wrap
your brain.

50:31.100 --> 50:34.600
- Hey, prag, come here.

50:34.667 --> 50:35.900
You listen up.

50:35.967 --> 50:37.500
You don't jabber
one fuckin' word to her

50:37.567 --> 50:38.800
about what
we done to you.

50:38.867 --> 50:40.033
- Yes, sir.

50:40.100 --> 50:41.500
- And clean that shit
off your face.

50:51.400 --> 50:53.133
- So that's it.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.367
You have nothing
else to say.

50:55.433 --> 50:57.967
- No, ma'am.

50:58.033 --> 50:59.433
- Tell me about your
relationship

50:59.500 --> 51:01.033
with Tobias
Beecher.

51:01.100 --> 51:03.567
- I don't have a relationship
with Beecher.

51:03.633 --> 51:04.867
- We shared a cell in Em City,
that's all.

51:04.934 --> 51:07.734
- What about when
you were both outside?

51:07.800 --> 51:09.734
- Our families were friendly,
but he's, like,

51:09.800 --> 51:10.900
10 years older than me.

51:10.967 --> 51:13.567
We never hung out
or anything.

51:13.633 --> 51:15.133
- What if I told you

51:15.200 --> 51:17.000
that he's very
concerned about you?

51:17.066 --> 51:19.633
- I'd tell you
he's a lying cocksucker.

51:21.300 --> 51:23.600
I'm sorry for swearing.

51:23.667 --> 51:26.700
- I've heard worse.

51:26.767 --> 51:28.734
Why is he a liar?

51:28.800 --> 51:29.834
- He knows why.

51:29.900 --> 51:31.266
- You don't want
to tell me?

51:31.333 --> 51:32.900
- Ask him.

51:37.467 --> 51:40.233
- Normally, my role in these
sessions is to mediate,

51:40.300 --> 51:43.467
to referee, but...

51:43.533 --> 51:46.266
Today I'm gonna be
a little more aggressive.

51:46.333 --> 51:49.834
Our subject
is Adam Guenzel.

51:49.900 --> 51:51.266
I had a meeting
with Adam Guenzel

51:51.333 --> 51:54.133
when he first
came to Oz.

51:54.200 --> 51:55.600
Since then,

51:55.667 --> 51:58.500
his behavior patterns
have changed significantly.

51:58.567 --> 52:02.000
Clearly he has
been abused sexually

52:02.066 --> 52:05.133
and I suspect that the three
of you know the details.

52:06.100 --> 52:07.734
Tobias?

52:13.266 --> 52:14.633
- He was raped,

52:14.700 --> 52:17.767
gang raped
about a week ago.

52:17.834 --> 52:19.200
- By whom?

52:24.800 --> 52:26.633
- I'm not investigating
this as a crime.

52:26.700 --> 52:30.800
I just want
to help the boy.

52:30.867 --> 52:32.700
Vern.

52:32.767 --> 52:34.567
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

52:37.200 --> 52:39.300
- Said,

52:39.367 --> 52:41.800
can you shed
any light on this?

52:51.166 --> 52:52.200
- No.

52:54.200 --> 52:56.100
- Fine.

52:56.166 --> 52:58.834
But I want you to know
that I am not

52:58.900 --> 53:00.900
letting this pass.

53:01.667 --> 53:04.600
I'm going to be seeing
Adam Guenzel every single day

53:04.667 --> 53:06.333
until I can get him
to open up,

53:06.400 --> 53:09.033
until he can tell me
exactly what happened.

53:09.100 --> 53:10.500
This session is closed.

53:11.867 --> 53:13.033
I am sick

53:13.100 --> 53:14.867
of sitting
in the same room with you.

53:18.667 --> 53:20.934
- Adam Guenzel has
become a liability.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.900
- You think he'll blab
to the nun?

53:22.967 --> 53:25.300
- Uh-huh.

53:25.367 --> 53:26.734
Hey, prag,

53:26.800 --> 53:27.734
get in here.

53:35.233 --> 53:36.500
- Yes, sir?

53:36.567 --> 53:39.667
- I've got good news.

53:39.734 --> 53:40.900
We're gonna
help you escape.

53:59.700 --> 54:01.867
- Beecher,
I've got some news.

54:01.934 --> 54:04.934
Adam Guenzel is dead.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.200
- What?

54:06.266 --> 54:08.300
- They just
found his body.

54:08.367 --> 54:10.567
Evidently he was
climbing the fence,

54:10.633 --> 54:13.266
he was attempting
to escape.

54:13.333 --> 54:14.900
He got
past the barbed wire,

54:14.967 --> 54:15.900
but then the fence...

54:15.967 --> 54:17.166
- He was electrocuted.

54:17.233 --> 54:20.967
- 4,000 volts,
straight through him.

54:21.033 --> 54:23.767
- Fuck.

54:23.834 --> 54:24.934
- I'm sorry.

55:10.300 --> 55:11.667
- So...

55:11.734 --> 55:13.633
that road to Hell that's
paved with good intentions--

55:13.700 --> 55:16.934
I'm not saying
to make a detour,

55:17.000 --> 55:19.200
only that before
you make your first step,

55:19.266 --> 55:21.533
consider the consequences.

55:21.600 --> 55:24.266
Because good
can turn to bad

55:24.333 --> 55:26.900
in the blink
of a fucking eye.
