She started working as an assistant to a
photographer.

17:56.533 --> 18:01.121
Uh-huh and how long was she with this photographer?

18:01.163 --> 18:04.750
Just a day maybe just a few hours actually.

18:06.001 --> 18:09.838
Shhh. She just started and then was I killed?

18:09.838 --> 18:14.343
-Yes.

18:14.384 --> 18:21.099

Wow

18:21.934 --> 18:23.477
Okay. Umm.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.858
I can start with talking to this guy.

18:29.858 --> 18:33.237
[Tina] -So you'll help?
-Well I mean it's not for free.

18:33.278 --> 18:38.325
I mean. There's a price, I am 60 an hour.

18:38.325 --> 18:42.120
Oh. I can't pay that much.

18:42.120 --> 18:46.375
[Miller] Whoa, hold on fuzzy sweater girl who
I don't know's name.

18:46.375 --> 18:51.380

18:51.380 --> 18:54.800
[Tina] -I don't know.
-25. Huh.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.761
-That's the lowest I can go.
-Okay.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.930
[Miller] Where's this guy work.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.099
Well I can show you.

[door knocking]

19:14.486 --> 19:15.362
[Adam] Hey.

19:22.327 --> 19:29.001
-Wow I mean I guess that explains it.
-Explains?

19:29.626 --> 19:31.044
I called her this morning and

19:31.044 --> 19:34.631
left a message on her phone but then she
just never showed up.

19:34.673 --> 19:38.093
[Miller] And you just met her right?

19:38.093 --> 19:38.927
Yeah.

19:40.387 --> 19:44.725
Are you okay? I don't even know what to
say about Olive.

19:44.725 --> 19:49.229
Yeah, I don't think it's really hit me yet.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.733
You work here alone Adam?

19:52.733 --> 19:54.526
Anyone else here with you?

19:55.110 --> 19:58.030
No just me, you know.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.617
Huh because Tina, Tina just told

20:01.617 --> 20:05.370
me that you broke up with your girlfriend.

20:05.996 --> 20:06.997
Yeah.

20:07.706 --> 20:12.753
Well it's weird because I don't see any
girlfriend you know type things

20:12.753 --> 20:17.007
lying around you know like any, I don't know, leftovers.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.637
What are you getting at?

20:21.637 --> 20:25.557
hmm I'm just getting an idea of where Olive was.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.017
Okay.

20:29.770 --> 20:34.316
Yes I did just break up with my girlfriend and
it wasn't a very good thing.

20:36.735 --> 20:41.531
You just saw her yesterday, she didn't
happen to mention you know

20:41.531 --> 20:49.122
where she was going or what she was doing
or you know anything fun?

20:49.122 --> 20:52.376
No just that she was going to go hang out with her boyfriend.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.796
You're really close to me right now.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.298
Tina is...

20:58.298 --> 21:01.093
[Adam] Are you sure there's nothing that I can
do for you?

21:01.093 --> 21:07.474
No, yeah I just I think I need to spend a little
time alone right now.

21:07.516 --> 21:13.438
[Miller] -Oh I will, I will take you home.
-Okay.

21:20.612 --> 21:21.822
God.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.538

21:40.590 --> 21:44.302
[Paul Fukuyama] Adam, look I know you're looking
for work but we've already started working with

21:44.302 --> 21:46.555
Sarah on two other projects.

21:46.555 --> 21:49.683
But if you let me I think that I can.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.893
[phone hang up click]

21:51.893 --> 21:53.353
[Adam] Paul?

21:58.525 --> 22:00.068

22:04.906 --> 22:10.495
And let them know that I will have those
prints by tomorrow. Hi can I help you?

22:11.329 --> 22:14.583

22:14.583 --> 22:17.377
I tend to be. What can I do for you?

22:17.377 --> 22:22.966
I'm Miller, private investigator Miller of
course as you can probably tell.

22:24.509 --> 22:29.723
You were seeing a young man recently, Adam.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.391
Yes.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.310
What was he like?

22:33.310 --> 22:35.729
He's harmless, why?

22:35.937 --> 22:40.317
His new assistant was... killed last night.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.111
[Sarah] He had an assistant.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.447
Yeah a real pretty one.

22:45.447 --> 22:50.994
-Okay so what can I do for you again?
-Right what's your take on his character?

22:50.994 --> 22:55.665
He's a loser can't get his shit together that's
why I left him.

22:55.665 --> 22:58.543
[Miller] And the last time you saw him was?

22:58.543 --> 23:01.338
I don't know maybe a couple days a week ago
is there anything

23:01.338 --> 23:06.635
in particular that I can do for you Mr. Miller
because I really have things to today.

23:06.760 --> 23:10.388
Whoa whoa well I can see why he wasn't up to your standards.

23:10.388 --> 23:13.350
-Oh most men aren't.
-Clearly.

23:13.850 --> 23:15.685
Have a good day Mr. Miller.

23:20.065 --> 23:24.027
-Slight turn Nicole.
-You seem a little distracted are you okay?

23:25.028 --> 23:33.411
Yeah my new assistant was killed yesterday
and you know just some other stuff.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.872
Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?

23:35.872 --> 23:39.417
If you know anyone who wants to be an
assistant that would be great.

23:39.417 --> 23:40.836
mmm

23:40.836 --> 23:44.506
-Really use one.
-Well we can forget about that right now

[news music intro]

36:31.772 --> 36:34.859
In this quiet suburban neighborhood, the
police have just left the scene of a

36:34.859 --> 36:38.988
third murder. Reports are coming in of
mysterious killings and people turning

36:38.988 --> 36:44.619
into what some are calling monsters and
with no evidence pointing to anyone

36:44.619 --> 36:48.748
directly the police are still without a suspect.
They have told us that the few

36:48.748 --> 36:52.376
leads they're looking into are in their favor,
but at this time there's nothing

36:52.376 --> 36:55.755
more they can tell us. Back to you Bob.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.728
So Adams a modern-day dr. Frankenstein

39:27.448 --> 39:29.241
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.702

40:23.003 --> 40:24.964
there was a guy killed last night.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.885
Inside his place there was a list of
photographers and Adams name.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.637
Was circled.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.101
You know it's some to go on.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.939
As far as Olive, I just don't have any more info on her.

40:42.690 --> 40:46.026
Well, Adam did say he took photos of her.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.863
Yeah that might that might help.

40:49.947 --> 40:50.447
Okay.

No Pete. I dragged it from the cage all the
way to the closet Pete by myself, mind you.

50:08.088 --> 50:09.881
And shoved it in there so she wouldn't see it.

50:10.882 --> 50:12.426
Why was it in the cage?

50:13.051 --> 50:15.053
Okay, I was trying to see if...

50:15.554 --> 50:17.305
I could make a monster.

50:18.890 --> 50:19.599
[Pete] What?

50:19.683 --> 50:20.016
Yeah.

50:20.016 --> 50:22.477
[Pete] Have you gone mad scientist on me
what do you mean making monsters?

50:22.477 --> 50:26.148
No no no Pete I haven't gone mad scientist
on you at all. Its this camera, look.

50:26.148 --> 50:29.276
It can make monsters when you just take pictures of people.

50:29.609 --> 50:30.610
Well don't pictures of me!

50:30.610 --> 50:31.695
[Adam] I'm sorry.

50:33.321 --> 50:33.822
Yeah.

50:35.949 --> 50:39.286
Pete what am I going to do, you gotta help
me man I gotta get it out of the closet and you're the only

50:39.286 --> 50:42.706
one strong enough to carry a monster across the city.

50:44.082 --> 50:45.709
Why did you call me over here?

50:46.334 --> 50:51.214
You have to help me, okay. The last one was
way to heavy, I cannot do this alone again.

50:51.214 --> 50:52.716
Wait, whoa you said again?

50:53.800 --> 50:55.552
Yes Pete, yes! Okay.

50:55.552 --> 51:00.599
There was a male model an attractive male
model with a tiny little dog and I took a picture of him

51:00.599 --> 51:03.643
and the dog was yapping and he turned into
a monster and I smacked him in the face

51:03.643 --> 51:04.770
with a tripod.

51:06.980 --> 51:08.148
[Adam] What do I do?

51:11.151 --> 51:12.652
Here's whatcha going to do.

51:12.652 --> 51:14.196
We need some trash bags

51:14.362 --> 51:15.238
A shovel.

51:15.238 --> 51:16.907
[Pete] Borrow a friends truck.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.575
And then we're going to bury the body in the woods.

51:18.575 --> 51:19.576
[Adam] Perfect.

51:20.118 --> 51:22.996
Definitely going to need to get heavier trash bags then this.

51:22.996 --> 51:25.540
Red white, not a good combination, right?

51:26.249 --> 51:28.335
-Then you gotta get rid of that camera.
-What?

51:29.044 --> 51:30.796
No, Pete I'm not getting rid of the camera.

51:31.087 --> 51:33.298
It turns people it's a monsters!

51:33.590 --> 51:34.925

[plastic bag and body hitting floor]

52:35.610 --> 52:36.278
Shit. Sorry.

52:38.029 --> 52:40.323

52:43.285 --> 52:45.829
[Adam] 1 2 3 okay.

52:51.084 --> 52:52.586
[Pete] Woo, so that model guy.

52:52.919 --> 52:54.963
-[Pete] He was a monster too?
-[Adam] Yeah.

52:58.008 --> 53:00.927
[Pete] Guess that means you haven't
actually killed anyone yet.

53:01.428 --> 53:02.345
No. No.

53:03.555 --> 53:04.347
[grunting]

53:05.181 --> 53:06.808
[deep water splash]

53:10.687 --> 53:11.730
So hows it work?

53:12.981 --> 53:16.860
I take pictures of people and when I transfer
them to the computer they just

53:16.860 --> 53:18.194
just turn into monsters.

53:18.737 --> 53:20.155
-Monsters huh?
-Yeah.

53:22.699 --> 53:24.993
Well... can't really call the cops.

53:25.744 --> 53:26.995
No. No, no cops.

53:29.497 --> 53:30.916
Thank you for helping me Pete.

53:31.958 --> 53:33.251
I helped you 1 time.

53:33.710 --> 53:34.252
No more.

53:35.086 --> 53:37.797
No. No more. No more.

53:37.797 --> 53:38.590
Lets get out of here.

53:39.174 --> 53:39.966

-Nothing.

54:24.052 --> 54:26.179
Bullshit nothing, I just helped you move a body.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.139
[Adam] Nothing, don't worry about it.

54:29.015 --> 54:33.269
Pete don't come over here, you don't
really need to see this, its not. Pete.

54:35.146 --> 54:36.523
What are you looking at her for?

54:36.523 --> 54:38.858
I didn't do it on purpose, she just showed
up on the front of a magazine.

54:39.067 --> 54:40.986
[Pete] Mmm hmm, so what were you thinking?

54:40.986 --> 54:42.237
I wan't thinking anything.

54:42.237 --> 54:43.822
Uh huh, so what are you thinking?

54:44.280 --> 54:46.449
She's getting all the work okay.

54:48.910 --> 54:49.703
and....

54:52.163 --> 54:53.957
Maybe I could turn her into a monster.

54:55.125 --> 54:55.875
Hell no!

54:56.084 --> 54:57.711
What, what is wrong with you?

54:58.420 --> 55:01.131
Pete it could be fun, its not going to kill her, she's just...

55:02.132 --> 55:03.174
going to be a monster.

55:04.009 --> 55:05.051
That's killing her.

55:05.677 --> 55:06.845
That's not killing her.

55:07.512 --> 55:09.681
Well someone's going to kill her as soon as she turns.

55:10.682 --> 55:12.517
I'm not going to kill her.

55:21.484 --> 55:25.071
No, no no no no I'm not going to help you kill her once you turn her into a monster.

55:25.071 --> 55:26.906
-You know what. I'm done.
-Fine.

56:23.213 --> 56:26.841
I was wondering if you could help me look
up a license plate from a few of your traffic cameras.

56:26.841 --> 56:28.259
[Larry] Sure you got the license number?

56:28.885 --> 56:30.595

Hey, you know I'm not just here making this
shit up you know, this guy seems to really have it

56:38.311 --> 56:39.187
out for you.

He's a pansy.

56:41.648 --> 56:42.315
Okay.

56:43.066 --> 56:44.734
Look, I know this guy well enough

56:45.151 --> 56:47.403
[Sarah] and he's not going to do anything.

56:47.403 --> 56:50.949
[Sarah] He's a freaking accident and he was
probably born on the freeway.

56:51.407 --> 56:56.037
[Miller] That may very well be the case, but
from what I figure, he's coming after you.

56:57.205 --> 56:57.705
Okay.

57:00.250 --> 57:02.627
Lets say he's coming after me. Now what?

57:05.130 --> 57:05.630
Now.

57:06.673 --> 57:08.133
I need to capture him.

57:09.467 --> 57:11.052
And keep you protected.

That is really sweet.

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:55.062

His camera. What?!

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:06.657
