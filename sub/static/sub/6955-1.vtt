01:13.000 --> 01:17.500
<i>I'm sittin' on top of the world</i>

01:17.620 --> 01:20.080
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

01:20.210 --> 01:23.460
<i>Yes, rollin' along</i>

01:23.590 --> 01:27.970
<i>And I'm quittin' the blues of the world</i>

01:28.090 --> 01:30.550
<i>I'm singin' a song</i>

01:30.680 --> 01:33.180
<i>Yes, singin' a song</i>

01:33.300 --> 01:36.390
<i>Glory hallelujah! I just told the parson</i>

01:36.510 --> 01:39.310
<i>"Hey, Par, get ready to call"</i>

01:39.430 --> 01:42.270
<i>Just like Humpty Dumpty</i>

01:42.390 --> 01:44.230
<i>I'm gonna fall</i>

01:44.350 --> 01:48.690
<i>And I'm sittin' on top of the world</i>

01:48.820 --> 01:51.480
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

01:51.610 --> 01:53.900
<i>Rollin' along</i>

01:54.030 --> 01:56.700
<i>Don't want any millions</i>

01:56.780 --> 01:59.120
<i>I'm gettin' my share</i>

01:59.240 --> 02:01.030
<i>I've only got one suit, just one</i>

02:01.160 --> 02:02.280
<i>Move along.</i>

02:02.410 --> 02:04.330
<i>That's all I can wear</i>

02:04.450 --> 02:06.870
<i>A bundle of money</i>

02:07.000 --> 02:09.330
<i>Don't make me feel gay</i>

02:09.460 --> 02:11.790
<i>A sweet little honey</i>

02:11.920 --> 02:15.300
<i>Is making me say</i>

02:15.420 --> 02:19.800
<i>And I'm sittin', sittin'
on top, top of the world</i>

02:19.920 --> 02:22.470
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

02:22.590 --> 02:25.640
<i>Rollin' along</i>

02:25.760 --> 02:30.180
<i>And I'm quittin', quittin'
the blues, blues of the world</i>

02:30.310 --> 02:32.770
<i>I'm singin' a song</i>

02:32.890 --> 02:35.350
<i>Yes, singin' a song</i>

02:35.480 --> 02:38.560
<i>Glory hallelujah! I just told the parson</i>

02:38.690 --> 02:41.400
<i>"Hey, Par, get ready to call"</i>

02:41.520 --> 02:44.320
<i>Just like Humpty Dumpty</i>

02:44.440 --> 02:45.950
<i>I'm gonna fall</i>

02:46.070 --> 02:50.820
<i>Yeah! I'm sittin' on top, top of the world</i>

02:50.950 --> 02:53.660
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

02:53.780 --> 02:56.700
<i>Rollin' along</i>

03:07.090 --> 03:10.010
That's a funny one. Isn't that funnier?

03:10.130 --> 03:11.300
It's hysterical, Manny.

03:11.420 --> 03:14.260
As long as we're laughing,
we won't cry over the box office.

03:14.380 --> 03:15.930
Talk about depressing.

03:16.050 --> 03:19.510
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around like circus ponies.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.140
That's depressing.

03:21.270 --> 03:23.520
I love a good chorus line.

03:25.350 --> 03:28.150
-What's this?
-It's a play.

03:28.270 --> 03:29.690
Who wrote it, Annie?

03:29.810 --> 03:31.570
Some guy. Driscoll.

03:32.070 --> 03:33.280
Driscoll.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.190
From the Federal Theatre.

03:35.320 --> 03:38.650
Don't knock it, honey.
At least they got an audience.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.240
It'll pick up. Isn't that right, Manny?

03:45.990 --> 03:47.490
It always does.

03:48.410 --> 03:49.500
See you tomorrow.

03:49.620 --> 03:53.670
The trick is to start to build
right from the back of your throat.

03:55.380 --> 03:57.340
Works well out through the nose, too.

03:57.460 --> 03:59.210
Have you eaten today?

04:00.590 --> 04:02.840
I'm not hungry. Don't worry about me.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.130
Hey.

04:05.430 --> 04:07.180
You're all I've got.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.850
Come on, take me to dinner.

04:11.720 --> 04:12.850
Okay.

04:13.270 --> 04:16.060
You think the kitchen will
still be open on Third?

04:16.350 --> 04:18.690
Soup and biscuits. Perfect.

04:25.570 --> 04:27.690
Harry, what's going on?

04:28.990 --> 04:32.200
-Hey, open up! We work here.
-Not anymore, lady.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.870
It's all right for you.
We haven't had a paycheck in two weeks.

04:35.990 --> 04:37.580
How we gonna eat?

04:37.830 --> 04:40.790
-They're not getting away with this!
-They just did.

04:40.910 --> 04:43.290
Ann, it's no use.

04:43.580 --> 04:46.290
The show, it's over. It's done.

04:47.130 --> 04:48.380
I'm done.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.550
I'm leaving, Annie.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.300
I'm going back to Chicago.

04:57.260 --> 04:58.760
I'm sorry.

04:59.930 --> 05:01.510
I'm sorry, Annie.

05:03.510 --> 05:06.890
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.900
You gotta think of yourself now.

05:11.190 --> 05:13.730
You should try out for that part.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.820
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

05:19.530 --> 05:22.780
Every time you reach out
for something you care about...

05:22.910 --> 05:25.570
fate comes along and snatches it away.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.240
But not this time, Annie.

05:28.910 --> 05:30.370
Not this time.

05:35.290 --> 05:37.630
-Oh, hello, Mr Weston.
-Oh, jeez.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.750
Look, miss, I told you already,
call my office.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.750
Leave your résumé with my secretary.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.920
Now, why would I want to do that
when we can talk about it in person?

05:46.050 --> 05:47.590
Because that's what a smart girl would do.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.140
But I already sent you my résumé.
You returned it unopened.

05:50.260 --> 05:53.260
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.

05:53.390 --> 05:54.970
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.270
Jesus, you don't give up, do you?

05:56.390 --> 05:57.890
Mr Weston, I know this role backwards.

05:58.020 --> 06:00.940
Well, that's too bad, 'cause we just
gave the part to someone else.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.400
I'm sorry, kid. The play is cast.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.150
I know times are tough.

06:09.690 --> 06:11.240
You want my advice?

06:11.530 --> 06:14.610
Use what you got. You're not bad-looking.

06:14.740 --> 06:17.320
A girl like you doesn't have to starve.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.040
There's a new place. It just opened.

06:26.670 --> 06:30.250
Now listen, princess, this gig
ain't the Palace, you understand?

06:30.380 --> 06:33.300
Ask for Kenny K. Tell him I sent you.

06:34.550 --> 06:37.010
Just play the date, take the money...

06:38.010 --> 06:39.970
forget you was ever there.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.040
How much more is there?

07:12.620 --> 07:14.290
Another five reels.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.000
Lights up.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.300
This is it?

07:26.010 --> 07:28.170
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?

07:28.300 --> 07:29.880
Another one of your safari pictures?

07:30.010 --> 07:33.050
You promised us romantic scenes with
Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie!

07:33.180 --> 07:34.800
Come on, fellows, you know the deal.

07:34.930 --> 07:36.470
We agreed to push Maureen's start date...

07:36.600 --> 07:38.140
so she could get her teeth fixed.

07:38.260 --> 07:41.020
It's not the principle of the thing,
it's the money.

07:41.140 --> 07:43.640
Carl, you've been in production
for over two months.

07:43.770 --> 07:46.440
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up the screen...

07:46.520 --> 07:48.360
once we get them on the ship.

07:49.190 --> 07:50.480
What ship?

07:50.780 --> 07:53.360
The one that we hired to get to the location.

07:53.490 --> 07:57.240
What location? Carl! You're supposed
to be shooting on the back lot.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.820
Yes, I understand that.

07:58.950 --> 08:01.280
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...

08:01.410 --> 08:02.620
and I'll tell you why.

08:02.740 --> 08:05.500
The story has changed.
The script has been rewritten.

08:05.620 --> 08:07.710
Life intervened.

08:08.710 --> 08:11.170
I've come into possession of a map.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.630
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.840
A place that was thought to exist
only in myth.

08:19.170 --> 08:20.170
Until now.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.260
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

08:22.380 --> 08:23.680
Is he asking for more money?

08:23.800 --> 08:26.350
He's asking us to fund a wild-goose chase.

08:26.470 --> 08:30.850
I'm talking about a primitive world
never before seen by man.

08:32.059 --> 08:35.020
The ruins of an entire civilisation.

08:36.350 --> 08:39.190
The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.730
That's where I'll shoot my picture.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.110
Will there be boobies?

08:48.410 --> 08:49.570
Boobies?

08:50.070 --> 08:52.740
Jigglies. Jiblonkas. Bazooms.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.660
In my experience,
people only go to these films...

08:55.740 --> 08:59.040
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.

08:59.250 --> 09:00.660
What are you, an idiot?

09:00.790 --> 09:03.960
You think they asked De Mille if he
would waste his time on nudie shots?

09:04.080 --> 09:07.670
No! They respected the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.170
Not that you'd know what that means,
you cheap lowlife!

09:15.390 --> 09:17.970
Would you step out for a moment, Carl?

09:31.730 --> 09:33.440
Give me that, quick.

09:35.150 --> 09:37.150
You won't like it. It's non-alcoholic.

09:37.280 --> 09:41.320
Preston, you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.870
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...

09:46.990 --> 09:49.870
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.250
He's had a lot of near-success.

09:52.830 --> 09:54.750
He's a preening self-promoter.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.130
An ambitious no-talent.
The guy's got "loser" written all over him.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.710
I understand your disappointment--
He can't direct.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.420
-He doesn't have the smarts.
-He's washed up.

10:03.550 --> 10:05.220
It's all over town.

10:05.630 --> 10:08.300
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.180
The animal footage has value.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.680
Sure. Universal are desperate
for stock footage.

10:12.810 --> 10:15.140
Then sell it! Scrap the picture.

10:17.940 --> 10:20.600
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.070
Get him back in.

10:25.190 --> 10:26.730
Mr Denham.

10:29.780 --> 10:31.910
I want the cast and crew on the ship
within the hour.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.110
No, Carl, you can't do this.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.370
Tell them the studio pressured us
into an early departure.

10:35.490 --> 10:37.450
-It's not ethical!
-What are they gonna do, sue me?

10:37.580 --> 10:38.620
They can get in line.

10:38.740 --> 10:40.120
I'm not gonna let them kill my film.

10:40.250 --> 10:43.620
You realise that none of
the camera equipment is on board?

10:43.750 --> 10:46.500
We have no permits, no visas.

10:46.630 --> 10:48.210
That's why I have you, Preston.

10:48.340 --> 10:50.380
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.380
In fact, we have no currency of any kind.

10:52.510 --> 10:53.550
He's there.

10:53.670 --> 10:55.340
-Get in there.
-Who's gonna pay for the ship?

10:55.470 --> 10:56.510
Get in.

10:59.340 --> 11:02.970
-You get out of there! Come here!
-Step on it! Step on it!

11:03.100 --> 11:06.100
Get out! You're finished, Denham!

11:09.060 --> 11:12.310
Don't worry, Preston.
I've had a lot of practice at this.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.940
I'm real good at crapping the crappers.

11:17.360 --> 11:21.280
Red Label, 80% proof, to be
packed in a crate marked "lemonade."

11:21.400 --> 11:22.450
You got it.

11:22.570 --> 11:24.860
Tell Maureen she doesn't have
six hours to put on her face.

11:24.990 --> 11:27.240
If she wants to be in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

11:27.370 --> 11:29.910
She doesn't wanna be in this picture.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.710
-Maureen pulled out.
-She pulled out?

11:33.830 --> 11:35.870
Yesterday. I told you.

11:36.250 --> 11:38.580
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

11:38.710 --> 11:40.630
That's what you told her.

11:41.130 --> 11:43.710
Yeah, but we're not shooting in Singapore.

11:43.840 --> 11:48.090
God damn it, Preston, all you had to
do was look her in the eye and lie.

11:48.380 --> 11:50.890
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.390
She's unavailable.

11:52.510 --> 11:55.260
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?

11:55.640 --> 11:57.640
You'll never get her
into a size four.

11:57.770 --> 12:01.270
You gotta get a girl
that'll fit into Maureen's costumes.

12:03.730 --> 12:04.860
Fay's a size four.

12:04.980 --> 12:08.440
Yes, she is,
but she's doing a picture with RKO.

12:10.150 --> 12:11.490
Cooper, huh?

12:13.320 --> 12:15.030
I might have known.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.780
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

12:17.910 --> 12:20.330
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

12:20.450 --> 12:21.830
-Not an option.
-Carl.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.370
I said I'd find a girl.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.710
For God's sake, Preston, think like a winner!

12:25.830 --> 12:28.620
Call Jack. I need that goddamn screenplay!

12:30.500 --> 12:32.540
Defeat is always momentary.

13:06.530 --> 13:07.570
What?

14:01.870 --> 14:05.160
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

14:06.450 --> 14:07.750
Excuse me.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.290
Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.510
Vaudeville, huh?

14:23.630 --> 14:26.640
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.510
If you don't kill them fast, they kill you.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.010
Mr Denham...

14:30.970 --> 14:32.060
I want you to know...

14:32.180 --> 14:34.940
that I'm not in the habit
of accepting charity from strangers.

14:35.060 --> 14:36.850
Or, for that matter...

14:37.520 --> 14:39.480
taking things that don't belong to me.

14:39.610 --> 14:41.480
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

14:41.610 --> 14:43.480
It's just that I haven't been paid in a while.

14:43.610 --> 14:46.990
That's awful.
Anyway, Ann.... May I call you Ann?

14:50.110 --> 14:53.450
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

14:56.040 --> 14:58.000
No, no. Oh, God, no.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.620
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.790
I'm not that type of person at all.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.540
What type of person are you?

15:04.670 --> 15:07.590
I'm someone you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

15:07.710 --> 15:11.720
Believe me, I am on the level.
No funny business. Please sit down.

15:12.050 --> 15:14.340
Please. Please.

15:18.300 --> 15:19.350
Okay.

15:21.390 --> 15:22.890
Ann, I want you to imagine...

15:23.020 --> 15:25.680
a handsome explorer bound for the Far East.

15:25.770 --> 15:28.020
You're filming in the Far East?

15:28.270 --> 15:29.560
Singapore.

15:31.650 --> 15:34.400
On board ship, he meets a mysterious girl.

15:34.730 --> 15:38.320
She's beautiful, she's fragile, haunted.

15:38.950 --> 15:42.070
And she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control...

15:42.200 --> 15:46.030
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.

15:46.410 --> 15:50.330
It's as if her whole life
has been a prelude to this moment...

15:52.210 --> 15:56.040
this fateful meeting that changes everything.

15:57.170 --> 16:00.710
And sure enough,
against her better judgement....

16:01.000 --> 16:02.460
She falls in love.

16:03.220 --> 16:04.220
Yes.

16:04.420 --> 16:06.380
But she doesn't trust it.

16:06.630 --> 16:09.510
She's not even sure if she believes in love.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.220
Really?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.770
If she loves someone, it's doomed.

16:15.890 --> 16:17.230
Why is that?

16:17.770 --> 16:20.230
Good things never last, Mr Denham.

16:25.980 --> 16:28.320
So you're interested.
Good. That's settled, then.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.900
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under some time pressure.

16:31.030 --> 16:33.410
-Well, I really--
-Ann, I'm telling you...

16:33.530 --> 16:34.820
you're perfect. Look at you.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.910
You're the saddest girl I've ever met.

16:37.030 --> 16:41.080
You're gonna make them weep, Ann.
You're gonna break their hearts.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.420
See, that's where you're wrong, Mr Denham.

16:44.540 --> 16:47.080
I make people laugh, that's what I do.

16:47.630 --> 16:49.750
Good luck with your picture.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.130
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

16:55.260 --> 16:56.590
I'm offering you money.

16:56.720 --> 17:00.340
Adventure, fame, the thrill of
a lifetime, and a long sea voyage.

17:00.470 --> 17:01.510
You want to read a script?

17:01.640 --> 17:04.640
Jack Driscoll's turning in a draft
as we speak.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.020
Jack Driscoll?

17:08.140 --> 17:09.440
Sure. Why?

17:09.560 --> 17:11.480
Wait. You know him?

17:12.650 --> 17:16.109
No, not personally. I've seen his plays.

17:16.270 --> 17:18.190
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann...

17:18.319 --> 17:21.280
Jack Driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.740
He said to me, "Carl...

17:22.859 --> 17:26.160
"somewhere out there
is a woman born to play this role."

17:26.280 --> 17:28.620
And as soon as I saw you, I knew.

17:30.990 --> 17:32.290
Knew what?

17:34.330 --> 17:36.540
It was always going to be you.

17:48.680 --> 17:51.050
How much do I owe you?
Make it a quarter.

17:51.180 --> 17:52.720
Keep the change.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.560
Is this the moving picture ship?

17:58.180 --> 17:59.560
Not exactly.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.060
It's actually this one over here.

18:11.650 --> 18:15.740
Don't let appearances deceive you.
It's much more spacious on board.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.660
-ls this all of the equipment?
-Yeah.

18:18.780 --> 18:19.830
-This is all of it?
-Yeah.

18:19.950 --> 18:21.490
-We're taking the Bell & Howell?
-Yeah.

18:21.620 --> 18:24.290
-Good. You got all the lenses?
-Sure.

18:24.410 --> 18:25.910
- Carl!
-Yes!

18:26.040 --> 18:28.330
Get it on board, fellows, come on.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.130
It's bad, it's bad.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.130
They're on their way. I've just had word.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.300
-Who?
-Men in uniform.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.470
The studio called the cops.

18:42.010 --> 18:43.970
Englehorn! Cast off!

18:44.100 --> 18:45.970
Hoist up the mainsail, raise the anchor...

18:46.100 --> 18:48.100
whatever the hell it is you do.
We gotta leave!

18:48.220 --> 18:49.810
I cannot do that.

18:50.270 --> 18:52.140
We are waiting on the manifest.

18:52.270 --> 18:54.690
What? Who? English, please.

18:55.020 --> 18:56.810
Paperwork, Mr Denham.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.570
I'll give you another $1,000 to leave now.

19:00.650 --> 19:03.030
You haven't given me the first $1,000 yet.

19:04.030 --> 19:05.280
Can we talk about this later?

19:05.400 --> 19:08.160
Can't you see
we're in the company of a VlP guest?

19:14.040 --> 19:15.290
Ma'am.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.540
Ann Darrow.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.710
So you are ready for this voyage,
Miss Darrow?

19:22.040 --> 19:23.090
Sure.

19:25.050 --> 19:26.210
Nervous?

19:28.880 --> 19:30.760
Nervous? No.

19:31.260 --> 19:34.050
Why? Should I be?

19:34.550 --> 19:37.220
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

19:39.930 --> 19:43.310
Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her cabin?

19:43.850 --> 19:46.190
Wonderful idea. Thank you, Preston.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.690
Miss Darrow, if you would just....

19:50.650 --> 19:54.070
Hi. My name is Preston. Carl's assistant.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.200
$2,000. It's a deal. Will you take a cheque?

19:57.820 --> 19:59.530
Do I have a choice?

20:00.740 --> 20:02.080
Please follow me.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.410
If there's anything that you....
Excuse me, fellows.

20:04.540 --> 20:08.370
If there's anything that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

20:26.930 --> 20:29.220
Oh, Jesus! Jack, you scared me.

20:29.350 --> 20:33.730
Listen. If anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me.

20:33.890 --> 20:36.390
Say I got depressed and committed suicide.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.650
Say I stuck my head down the toilet.

20:39.610 --> 20:41.650
-You want one?
-No. I can't stay, Carl.

20:41.770 --> 20:44.730
I got a rehearsal for which
I am now three hours late.

20:45.690 --> 20:47.990
-What's this?
-It's the script.

20:51.110 --> 20:52.740
This is a script?

20:53.370 --> 20:55.580
Jack, this is 15 pages.

20:55.700 --> 20:58.290
I know, but they're good.
You've got 15 good pages there, Carl.

20:58.410 --> 21:00.370
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.830
You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.920
No, Jack, you can't do this to me.
I have a beginning...

21:05.040 --> 21:07.630
but I need a middle and an end.
I gotta have something to shoot.

21:07.750 --> 21:10.920
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

21:15.380 --> 21:17.890
All right, fine. We might as well settle up.

21:19.430 --> 21:20.760
You're gonna pay me?

21:20.890 --> 21:22.770
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

21:24.980 --> 21:27.770
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

21:27.890 --> 21:29.650
How's $2,000 sound?

21:31.360 --> 21:32.770
Sounds great.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.570
I thought it might.

21:34.690 --> 21:37.150
-Sounds great.
-Okay.

21:50.290 --> 21:51.830
And voilà.

21:52.540 --> 21:53.710
Thanks.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.590
You've written "two grand."

22:00.800 --> 22:04.420
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from the beginning.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.180
"Two thousand dollars."

22:15.140 --> 22:16.770
It is the 29th, isn't it?

22:16.890 --> 22:19.600
Oh, come on, it's the 25th. It's the 25th.

22:20.020 --> 22:22.230
God, I'm sorry. It'll just take a sec.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.440
Never mind, Carl.
Just pay me when you get back.

22:24.570 --> 22:25.900
All right.

22:39.330 --> 22:42.370
Your cabin is the last on the left, Mr Baxter.

22:42.500 --> 22:46.960
And may I just say how excited we
are to have you back with us, sir?

22:47.080 --> 22:48.790
Be a sport and lend a hand here,
would you?

22:48.920 --> 22:51.340
Excuse me. I'm trying to.... I gotta get--

22:54.010 --> 22:55.130
Christ!

22:56.010 --> 22:57.840
Appreciate the help, fellow.

22:57.970 --> 23:00.050
Let me get the door for you.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.300
Welcome to your stateroom, sir.

23:08.890 --> 23:10.940
Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes.

23:11.060 --> 23:12.940
Dead slow ahead both, Captain.

23:20.860 --> 23:22.280
Oh, Christ!

23:31.700 --> 23:33.080
God damn it!

23:41.540 --> 23:44.920
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theatre.

23:47.970 --> 23:49.470
Oh, no! No!

23:50.930 --> 23:53.680
You're much better off sticking with film.

23:53.970 --> 23:56.350
I don't do it for the money, Carl.

23:57.810 --> 23:59.980
I happen to love the theatre.

24:00.430 --> 24:01.890
No, you don't.

24:03.230 --> 24:05.190
If you really loved it...

24:05.650 --> 24:07.190
you would have jumped.

24:27.330 --> 24:30.460
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light, fresh straw.

24:30.580 --> 24:32.540
Jesus. What do you keep down here?

24:32.670 --> 24:34.960
Lion, tiger, hippo, you name it.

24:36.050 --> 24:37.710
You sell them to zoos?

24:37.840 --> 24:39.380
Zoo, circus.

24:39.720 --> 24:42.300
Skipper get big money for rare animal.

24:42.470 --> 24:45.550
Careful. Camel have bad accident on floor.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.390
Stain unremovable.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.020
Skipper catch any wild animal you want.

24:53.140 --> 24:54.980
He'll do you real good price on white rhino.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.150
Choy.

24:58.480 --> 25:01.820
My apologies for not being able
to offer you a cabin.

25:01.940 --> 25:04.690
Have you found an enclosure to your taste?

25:05.950 --> 25:07.240
Spoiled for choice.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.030
What are you, Mr Driscoll? A lion?

25:11.120 --> 25:12.830
Or a chimpanzee?

25:14.330 --> 25:15.910
I'll take this one.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.550
I told you to lock it up.

25:30.670 --> 25:34.140
-Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said--
-Lumpy doesn't give the orders!

25:34.260 --> 25:37.260
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.390
Get them out of here.

26:17.500 --> 26:20.380
-Compliments of the chef.
-Okay.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.800
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

26:28.390 --> 26:30.680
Lamb's brains in walnut sauce.

26:36.390 --> 26:37.520
Jimmy.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.690
You run those ropes up on deck
like I told you?

26:39.810 --> 26:41.770
Doing it now, Mr Hayes.

26:42.110 --> 26:45.990
How about
you return Mr Driscoll's pen first?

26:53.820 --> 26:55.660
He don't mean no harm.

26:56.580 --> 26:57.660
Thanks.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.500
-I'll keep him out of your way.
-It's okay.

26:59.620 --> 27:02.080
It's just that he likes it down here.

27:02.210 --> 27:04.750
It's where I found him four years ago.

27:05.130 --> 27:07.670
Stowed away in one of them back cages.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.380
His arm was broken in two places.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.470
He was wilder than half the animals in here.

27:16.380 --> 27:18.970
Still won't tell me where he came from.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.260
But it wasn't anyplace good.

27:24.970 --> 27:26.930
You got to straighten up.

27:27.230 --> 27:28.350
Jimmy.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.190
You don't want to be on this ship
the rest of your life.

27:32.310 --> 27:34.610
-Yes, I do.
-No, you don't, Jimmy.

27:34.860 --> 27:37.190
You got to be smart. Get yourself educated.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.190
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!

27:39.320 --> 27:41.360
I do, Mr Hayes, I do. Look.

27:41.570 --> 27:43.030
I've been reading.

27:45.990 --> 27:47.660
Where'd you get this?

27:48.040 --> 27:49.290
I borrowed it.

27:52.580 --> 27:54.420
On long-term loan.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.380
Look at this. Look, look.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.710
"Adventures on a tramp steamer."
See? Just like us.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.390
It's so nice to meet you, Mr Driscoll.

28:10.140 --> 28:12.970
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.

28:16.980 --> 28:20.100
Hello, Mr Driscoll. It's so nice to meet you.

28:20.270 --> 28:23.150
Actually, I'm quite familiar with your work.

28:23.860 --> 28:25.440
I'm a huge fan.

28:25.570 --> 28:27.440
I've read everything you've ever written.

28:27.570 --> 28:28.990
No, too much.

28:29.740 --> 28:32.950
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialogue.

28:33.740 --> 28:35.030
Seagulls.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.200
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.

28:38.330 --> 28:39.410
I don't care, Mike.

28:39.540 --> 28:41.910
You're the sound recordist. Make it work.

28:43.410 --> 28:46.170
Ann! Come on in.
Let me introduce you to the crew.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.420
This is Herb, the cameraman.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.710
-Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
-Likewise.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.920
May I say what a lovely dress?

28:54.050 --> 28:56.880
Oh, this old thing? I just threw it on.

28:57.420 --> 28:59.930
Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes?

29:00.340 --> 29:04.060
Now, what does a girl have to do
around here to get some breakfast?

29:04.180 --> 29:06.140
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

29:06.270 --> 29:09.680
Fancy my porridge à la walnuts?

29:13.810 --> 29:16.400
Oh, Ann, I don't believe you've met....

29:18.860 --> 29:19.900
Ann?

29:20.400 --> 29:23.530
That's all right, Mr Denham.
I know who this is.

29:28.830 --> 29:32.410
Thrilled to meet you.
It's an honour to be a part of this.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.080
Gee, thanks.

29:35.710 --> 29:38.580
Actually, I'm quite familiar with your work.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.210
Really?

29:41.040 --> 29:43.090
Yes, and what I most admire...

29:43.210 --> 29:46.760
is the way you've captured
the voice of the common people.

29:48.050 --> 29:49.800
Well, that's my job.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.050
I'm sure you've heard this before,
Mr Driscoll...

29:55.180 --> 29:56.600
if you don't mind me saying...

29:56.720 --> 29:59.730
but you don't look
at all like your photograph.

30:04.900 --> 30:06.560
-Excuse me.
-Wait a minute, Ann--

30:06.690 --> 30:09.440
He's so much younger in person.
And much better-looking.

30:09.570 --> 30:11.110
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

30:11.230 --> 30:13.360
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be...

30:13.490 --> 30:16.240
one of those self-obsessed literary types.

30:16.780 --> 30:18.110
-I'm sorry, I'm not--
-You know...

30:18.240 --> 30:21.950
the tweedy twerp with his nose
in his book and his head up his--

30:26.160 --> 30:28.830
It's nice to meet you, too, Miss Darrow.

30:42.760 --> 30:44.140
Good Christ!

31:10.660 --> 31:14.160
She's standing at the railing.
She doesn't know it yet...

31:15.450 --> 31:18.910
but they are sailing towards disaster.
You got that?

31:19.120 --> 31:20.830
Okay, so she turns...

31:22.170 --> 31:24.000
the first mate is staggering towards her.

31:25.420 --> 31:27.960
There's a knife sticking out of his back.

31:28.090 --> 31:30.970
Wait a sec. We're killing off the first mate?

31:31.550 --> 31:33.680
That's assuming
she knows who the first mate is.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.600
Come on, Jack. It was an honest mistake.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.220
Ann is nearsighted.
It could have happened to anyone.

31:39.350 --> 31:40.890
I was joking, Carl.

31:41.020 --> 31:44.270
The point is, she's horrified.
She has to look away.

31:47.020 --> 31:49.110
And that's when she sees it.

31:51.320 --> 31:52.650
Sees what?

31:53.940 --> 31:55.030
What?

32:00.570 --> 32:01.910
The island.

32:05.540 --> 32:09.870
We're filming on an island now?
When did this happen?

32:10.790 --> 32:13.210
Jack, keep your voice down.

32:13.710 --> 32:16.250
I don't want the crew getting spooked.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.880
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

32:20.010 --> 32:21.970
All right. It has a local name...

32:22.090 --> 32:24.550
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.340
They call it Skull lsland.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.140
Did you get that?

32:29.970 --> 32:31.260
What's wrong with this place?

32:31.390 --> 32:34.060
There's nothing officially wrong with it.

32:34.310 --> 32:37.640
Because, technically,
it hasn't been discovered yet.

32:40.100 --> 32:42.020
Okay. All right.

32:44.270 --> 32:46.490
So we arrive at this place.

32:47.110 --> 32:48.280
S...

32:48.950 --> 32:50.110
K...

32:51.200 --> 32:52.530
U...

32:53.570 --> 32:54.740
L...

32:56.280 --> 32:57.490
L...

33:03.000 --> 33:04.330
Island.

33:08.670 --> 33:11.760
All right, everyone, from the top!
And action!

33:13.340 --> 33:16.970
I think this is awfully exciting!
I've never been on a ship before.

33:17.090 --> 33:19.640
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.

33:19.760 --> 33:23.180
I guess you don't think much
of women on ships, do you?

33:23.600 --> 33:25.220
No, they're a nuisance.

33:25.350 --> 33:28.940
-Well, I'll try not to be.
-Just being around is trouble.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.280
Cut!

33:39.440 --> 33:40.780
It's great.

33:40.950 --> 33:45.120
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

33:45.240 --> 33:48.120
That was very natural. I felt moved.

33:48.290 --> 33:51.750
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some flow now, huh?

33:51.870 --> 33:53.620
It was pure effluence.

33:53.750 --> 33:55.460
I beefed up the banter.

33:55.580 --> 33:57.670
Try to resist that impulse.

33:58.330 --> 33:59.960
It's just a little bit of humour, bud.

34:00.090 --> 34:02.500
What are you, a Bolshevik or something?

34:02.630 --> 34:03.800
Actors.

34:04.970 --> 34:08.219
Travel the world,
but all they ever see is a mirror.

34:20.730 --> 34:22.020
Good legs.

34:23.730 --> 34:26.270
Sea legs. Well, you know, sea legs.

34:28.860 --> 34:29.860
Yeah.

34:29.989 --> 34:33.570
Not that you don't have good legs.
Just making conversation.

34:33.699 --> 34:35.949
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

34:37.949 --> 34:40.449
About the scene today with you and Bruce--

34:40.580 --> 34:42.330
I know it wasn't what you wrote...

34:42.449 --> 34:46.460
but Mr Baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman...

34:47.120 --> 34:48.750
he must ignore her.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.670
And if things turn really hostile, then....

34:52.590 --> 34:53.750
No?

34:53.880 --> 34:55.550
Interesting theory.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.300
I know. I should have....

34:58.470 --> 35:00.680
It wasn't what I had intended, but--

35:00.800 --> 35:02.260
I'm sorry. I was....

35:02.390 --> 35:04.350
And you made it your own.

35:05.350 --> 35:06.810
I was nervous.

35:07.060 --> 35:09.640
It was funny, actually. You were funny.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.850
Please don't say another word. Good night.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.350
Miss Darrow.

35:20.030 --> 35:22.190
You don't have to be nervous.

36:32.750 --> 36:34.040
Thank you.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.590
Let's take it....

36:36.710 --> 36:38.960
Would you please....
We're trying to shoot a scene.

36:39.090 --> 36:40.670
-Okay.
-Thank you.

36:41.130 --> 36:42.220
Okay, again.

36:56.810 --> 36:58.940
We're close. Turn southwest.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.610
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

37:04.570 --> 37:07.070
It takes us way outside the shipping lanes.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.610
I won't sail blind in these waters.

37:10.700 --> 37:12.910
I'll make it worth your while.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.240
There's nothing out there.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.370
Well, then you've nothing to lose.

37:31.470 --> 37:35.390
If someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for Singapore...

37:36.890 --> 37:38.600
what would you say?

37:38.720 --> 37:41.470
I would say they're full of it, Mr Hayes.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.980
Well, we turned southwest last night.

37:46.190 --> 37:47.810
Gentlemen, please.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.770
-We're not looking for trouble.
-No.

37:53.150 --> 37:55.480
You're looking for something else.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.280
Yes, we are.

38:01.990 --> 38:04.330
We're going to find Skull lsland.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.740
Find it, film it, and show it to the world.

38:08.790 --> 38:12.500
For 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.130
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.050
What do you mean?

38:19.840 --> 38:22.380
Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes
were working our passage...

38:22.510 --> 38:24.010
on a Norwegian bark.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.930
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

38:27.220 --> 38:29.010
He'd been drifting for days.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.510
His ship had run aground
on an island way west of Sumatra.

38:32.640 --> 38:36.020
An island hidden in fog.

38:37.850 --> 38:40.060
He spoke of a huge wall...

38:41.400 --> 38:43.110
built so long ago...

38:43.650 --> 38:45.650
no one knew who'd made it.

38:45.900 --> 38:48.780
A wall 100 foot high...

38:49.070 --> 38:51.860
as strong today as it was ages ago.

38:53.700 --> 38:55.660
Why'd they build the wall?

39:00.120 --> 39:03.750
Well, the castaway, he spoke of a creature...

39:04.210 --> 39:06.290
neither beast nor man...

39:06.830 --> 39:10.050
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.460
A lion or a tiger.

39:13.460 --> 39:15.720
A man-eater.
That's how all these stories start.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.590
What else did he say?

39:17.970 --> 39:19.050
Nothing.

39:19.180 --> 39:22.850
We found him the next morning.
He'd stuck a knife through his heart.

39:23.430 --> 39:26.480
Sorry, fellows.
You'll have to do better than that.

39:27.730 --> 39:29.980
Monsters belong in B movies.

39:30.100 --> 39:32.060
If you find this place...

39:32.610 --> 39:36.020
if you go ashore with your friends
and your cameras...

39:37.230 --> 39:38.860
you won't come back.

39:39.900 --> 39:42.360
Just as long as you understand that.

41:02.260 --> 41:05.100
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?

41:10.730 --> 41:12.940
You're writing a stage comedy?

41:13.100 --> 41:14.940
I'm writing it for you.

41:17.150 --> 41:18.980
Why would you do that?

41:19.980 --> 41:22.780
-Why would I write a play for you?
-Yes.

41:24.490 --> 41:26.070
Isn't it obvious?

41:28.820 --> 41:30.120
Not to me.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.160
Well...

41:36.750 --> 41:38.500
it's in the subtext.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.460
I guess I must have missed it.

41:48.630 --> 41:50.380
It's not about words.

42:33.540 --> 42:35.500
Message for you, Captain.

42:53.930 --> 42:55.520
What's going on?

42:56.350 --> 42:59.150
Hayes, why are we changing course?

43:00.730 --> 43:02.980
-Englehorn, you can't just--
-Outside.

43:07.070 --> 43:09.660
There's a warrant out for your arrest.

43:10.030 --> 43:11.620
Did you know that?

43:14.080 --> 43:16.660
I've been ordered to divert to Rangoon.

43:20.870 --> 43:24.170
Another week. I haven't got a film yet.

43:25.500 --> 43:28.210
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

43:28.340 --> 43:31.550
No, Denham. You risked everything I have.

43:33.510 --> 43:34.720
What do you want?

43:34.840 --> 43:37.050
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

43:37.180 --> 43:39.050
I want you off my ship.

43:41.640 --> 43:44.140
Set a course for Rangoon, Mr Hayes.

43:50.770 --> 43:52.190
I'm finished.

43:53.730 --> 43:55.530
It's over for me, Jack.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.780
How'd you think this would end, Carl?

44:15.540 --> 44:18.920
Check our position. Use the stars.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.720
There are no stars, Captain.

44:37.180 --> 44:38.560
What is that?

44:40.560 --> 44:42.610
-What?
-That.

44:46.610 --> 44:48.240
That right there.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.070
I don't know. What is it? A coffee stain?

46:30.400 --> 46:34.200
Station the forward lookout
and get me the depth by lead line.

46:34.530 --> 46:35.990
Aye, Captain.

46:47.330 --> 46:49.420
30 fathoms, no bottom!

46:51.290 --> 46:54.210
Reduce speed, steerage way only.

46:55.050 --> 46:56.840
Dead slow ahead, both.

46:59.930 --> 47:01.890
You should stop the ship.

47:03.300 --> 47:05.050
15 degrees port.

47:07.970 --> 47:09.680
We're getting out of here, Mr Hayes.

47:09.810 --> 47:11.850
We'll find clear conditions.

47:12.560 --> 47:14.060
We have seabed!

47:19.860 --> 47:21.320
25 fathoms!

47:23.240 --> 47:24.650
We're shallowing!

47:24.780 --> 47:26.070
20 degrees starboard!

47:26.200 --> 47:28.200
Captain, you don't know
where the hell you're going!

47:28.320 --> 47:29.910
Get me another reading!

47:33.200 --> 47:34.750
Another reading!

47:37.330 --> 47:39.040
22 fathoms!

47:40.580 --> 47:42.630
-Douse the lights.
-Aye, Captain.

47:54.680 --> 47:56.050
10 fathoms!

48:07.650 --> 48:10.400
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

48:27.700 --> 48:29.160
Stop engines!

49:32.510 --> 49:34.260
Give me some power! Half astern both.

49:34.380 --> 49:36.430
Half astern both, Captain!

49:41.010 --> 49:42.180
Rocks!

49:45.350 --> 49:46.480
Rocks!

49:51.060 --> 49:53.190
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

49:53.730 --> 49:56.070
To port! Rocks everywhere!

49:56.280 --> 49:57.820
Take the wheel, Hayes.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.210
Hang on!

50:39.730 --> 50:41.020
Full ahead!

50:46.900 --> 50:48.740
Rocks to port, Captain!

50:49.740 --> 50:52.490
Turn, Captain!
Starboard, starboard!

52:19.930 --> 52:21.480
Shore up that breach!

52:21.600 --> 52:25.230
Get me more men down here now!
Come on, move, move!

52:26.900 --> 52:29.150
-Hayes!
-She's taken a pounding!

52:31.440 --> 52:32.860
What about the prop?

52:32.990 --> 52:35.110
The shaft's not bent, as far as we can tell.

52:35.240 --> 52:37.410
But she struck hard against the rock!

52:38.450 --> 52:39.660
Captain!

52:40.370 --> 52:42.080
Better come up quick!

52:44.000 --> 52:45.370
Right there!

53:00.220 --> 53:02.260
Want me to bring them back?

53:02.970 --> 53:04.600
I don't give a damn about Carl Denham.

53:04.720 --> 53:08.180
I want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide!

53:08.310 --> 53:09.890
Come on, move it.

53:11.100 --> 53:13.060
We're leaving, Mr Hayes.

53:20.480 --> 53:22.570
Can you believe this, Jack?

53:25.900 --> 53:27.740
We've got our picture.

54:25.370 --> 54:28.040
Why does Marlow keep going up the river?

54:29.460 --> 54:31.420
Why doesn't he turn back?

54:33.880 --> 54:36.670
There's a part of him that wants to, Jimmy.

54:38.050 --> 54:41.170
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

54:43.050 --> 54:45.090
But there's another part...

54:46.260 --> 54:47.970
that needs to know.

54:51.220 --> 54:54.020
To defeat the thing which makes him afraid.

54:55.980 --> 54:59.230
"We could not understand
because we were too far...

55:00.150 --> 55:01.310
"and could not remember...

55:01.440 --> 55:04.900
"because we were travelling
in the night of first ages...

55:05.780 --> 55:08.030
"of those ages that are gone...

55:09.280 --> 55:11.950
"leaving hardly a sign, and no memories.

55:14.870 --> 55:16.040
"We are accustomed to look...

55:16.160 --> 55:19.290
"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster...

55:21.790 --> 55:23.250
"but there...

55:24.670 --> 55:28.380
"there you could look
at a thing monstrous and free. "

55:38.430 --> 55:40.640
It's not an adventure story...

55:41.260 --> 55:42.850
is it, Mr Hayes?

55:44.890 --> 55:46.180
No, Jimmy.

55:47.310 --> 55:48.690
It's not.

56:11.200 --> 56:13.580
-It's deserted.
-Of course it's deserted.

56:13.710 --> 56:17.080
Use your eyes, Preston. The place is a ruin.

56:18.540 --> 56:21.300
Nobody's lived here for hundreds of years.

57:35.890 --> 57:38.350
Mr Denham, I think we should go back.

57:38.470 --> 57:40.180
I will handle this.

57:45.650 --> 57:47.230
Look. Chocolate.

57:48.520 --> 57:50.190
You like chocolate?

57:53.030 --> 57:54.650
It's good to eat.

57:57.030 --> 57:58.280
You want?

58:04.330 --> 58:05.500
Take it.

58:13.290 --> 58:15.630
Here, put it in your hand and take it.

58:21.720 --> 58:24.140
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.

58:24.260 --> 58:26.510
She doesn't want the chocolate.

58:51.740 --> 58:53.080
All right!

58:53.490 --> 58:55.950
Just a bunch of women and old folks!

58:57.790 --> 58:59.370
They're harmless!

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.150
Ann!

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.720
Jack.

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:06.360
Seen enough?

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.870
Lighten the ship!

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:20.040
Anything that's not bolted down
goes overboard!

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:23.870
Just heave it!

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:25.620
We got away.

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:27.420
We gotta be grateful for that, gentlemen.

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:31.250
What about Mike? He didn't get away!
He's still there!

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.260
Mike died doing what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing.

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:39.380
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm gonna finish this film for Mike!

01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:47.470
I'll finish it...

01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:51.690
and I'll donate the proceeds...

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.190
to his wife and kids.

01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:58.190
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:00.400
Hear, hear!

01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:41.270
Chuck everything except for the potatoes!

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:49.650
-What's wrong now?
-Excuse me, Shakespeare.

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:52.530
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:07.160
Drop those spare cables overboard!
Go on, just chuck it!

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.760
-Where's Ann?
-What?

01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:27.970
Where's Ann?

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:34.480
Ann!

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.490
She's free!

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.420
Full ahead, both engines!

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.130
Ann!

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.610
No! Stop! Turn back!

01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:41.200
Stop!

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.870
We have to turn back.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.740
They've taken Ann.

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.580
No!

01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:02.260
Kong! Kong! Kong!

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:48.340
All hands going ashore! Report to stations!

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:52.090
Jump to it! Jump to it, gentlemen!

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.470
We're doing it, Mr Hayes!

01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:06.560
Come on, move it!

01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:25.240
Pull harder!

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.450
Row! Row!

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.870
Come on!

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.830
Kong.

01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:41.940
Spread out! Find her!

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.160
Miss Darrow!

01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:55.160
-Check up there, Jimmy!
-Everybody stay together!

01:10:58.620 --> 01:10:59.620
Ann!

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:03.500
She's here somewhere!

01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:10.050
What in God's name was that?

01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:18.010
Behind the wall!

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.350
Behind the wall!

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.390
She's gone!

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.110
Carl, what is it?

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:34.410
You saw something.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:44.420
You can take Hayes and 15 others.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.880
I'll put a guard on the gate until you return.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.420
The rest of you stay with the ship.

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:51.630
Choy!

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:54.970
Not you, Jimmy.

01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:57.220
Come on, Mr Hayes. Look at them.

01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:59.050
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:00.430
Stay here.

01:13:00.970 --> 01:13:03.430
-Miss Darrow needs me!
-No!

01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:10.650
Bring the tripod and all of the film stock.

01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:13.150
You wanna go with the 6-inch lens?

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:16.020
The wide-angle will do just fine.

01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:24.950
You got guns. You got food.
You got the ammo.

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:27.240
And you got 24 hours!

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.120
24 hours?

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:31.540
This time tomorrow, we haul anchor.

01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:56.520
Miss Darrow!

01:13:58.930 --> 01:14:00.020
Ann!

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.810
Miss Darrow!

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:14.570
Miss Darrow!

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.170
What is it?

01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:45.220
Fire!

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:48.310
Cut it out.

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.020
Hold your fire.

01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:53.190
Hold your fire!

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.380
Stay down, damn it. Stay down.

01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:44.640
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.300
Good shooting, Mr Hayes.

01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:24.760
Aren't these things
supposed to be extinct?

01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:26.430
They are now.

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:34.770
What the hell kind of a place is this?

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.700
Miss Darrow!

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:57.500
Ann!

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.180
No!

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:33.910
Ann!
Miss Darrow!

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:43.580
Ann!

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:54.090
Ann!

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.460
Christ, it's a bleeding boneyard!

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:37.290
They've been ripped limb from limb.

01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:41.590
Ann! Ann!

01:19:54.850 --> 01:19:57.100
Just keep walking, Mr Hayes.
Pretend you didn't see me.

01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.140
-Jesus, Jimmy.
-Hey, I need that!

01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:00.480
I'm not giving you a gun!

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.560
You were younger than me
when they gave you one!

01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:06.190
I was in the Army. I was trained.
I had a drill sergeant.

01:20:07.690 --> 01:20:09.820
I wanna help bring her back.

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:19.620
Don't make me regret it.

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:49.300
Conserve your ammunition!

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.140
I'm knackered.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.520
I gotta have a breather.
Great idea.

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:06.070
Fellows, we don't have time for this.

01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:08.570
We've lost too much ground already.
Come on, get up!

01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:12.070
They're not about to quit on you.
Cut them some slack.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.570
All right, you got five minutes!

01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:16.740
Everybody stay in sight.

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.160
Over here. I'm gonna get
a wide shot of the valley.

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.770
Bloody Nora!

01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:05.110
Is that what took Miss Darrow?

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:12.830
There's only one creature capable
of leaving a footprint that size.

01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:21.170
The abominable snowman.

01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:25.460
-Yeah, a snowman.
-We dead meat.

01:22:26.170 --> 01:22:28.590
It's got to be what, 20, 25 feet?

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.130
Carl saw it.

01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:35.010
Let's ask him.

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:38.350
Denham!

01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:42.180
Where'd he go?

01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:04.160
Walk forward, Bruce.

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.500
-What?
-You're the star of this picture.

01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:09.620
Get into character
and head toward the animals.

01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:18.380
What the hell kind of a place is this?

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.890
Are you sure about this, Denham?

01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:33.480
Don't we have a stand-in
for this type of thing?

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:36.480
I need you in the shot,
or people will say they're fake.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.730
Nobody's gonna think these are fake.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.410
You're making them nervous.
No sudden movements.

01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:50.780
I'm not moving.

01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.910
Mother of God.

01:24:20.850 --> 01:24:22.220
What's this?

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:49.910
What is it? What is it? Where's Carl?

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.790
Carl? He's up there, filming.

01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:04.630
Bugger this!

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:06.720
Watch out.

01:25:12.010 --> 01:25:13.350
Run, Jack!

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:19.140
-Holy Christ.
-Go, Jimmy, run!

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:21.560
Run, run, run!

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.030
-Let go!
-I'm not leaving the camera!

01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:31.400
Let go, you idiot!

01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:33.320
Carl, run!

01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:48.000
Look out!

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:49.880
Look out!

01:26:40.170 --> 01:26:41.710
Coming through!

01:27:45.970 --> 01:27:47.010
No!

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.970
Come on.

01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:32.840
Carl! Carl!

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:38.560
Get up! Come on. Come on.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.030
Mr Denham! Mr Denham!

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.360
Herb! Herb, come on!

01:28:59.450 --> 01:29:01.160
Take the tripod!

01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:02.620
Come on!

01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:06.370
I'm pulling you up! Hold on to your end!

01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:07.500
Go!

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.250
No, I'm not going anywhere without you!

01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:12.580
-You gotta leave me!
-Shut up and hold on!

01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:22.060
Jimmy, do a head count.

01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:24.640
I want to know how many are injured
and how bad.

01:30:24.730 --> 01:30:25.980
Injured?

01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:29.150
Four of us are dead!

01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:37.610
It's not your fault.

01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:40.780
What happened to Herb is no one's fault.

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.620
You're absolutely right, Preston.

01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:46.450
And I'll tell you something else.

01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:48.790
Herbert didn't die for nothing.

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:52.000
He died for what he believed in,
and I'm gonna honour that.

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:56.130
He died believing there was still
some mystery left in this world.

01:30:56.630 --> 01:30:59.210
And we could all have a piece of it...

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.960
for the price of an admission ticket.

01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:05.880
God damn it, Preston, we're gonna
finish this film for Herb.

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:07.970
We'll finish it...

01:31:08.050 --> 01:31:10.970
and donate the proceeds
to his wife and kids.

01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:20.480
Come on, guys. We need more rope.

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.400
All right, we gotta get back to the ship.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:28.150
-Englehorn sails in nine hours.
-So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.860
Hey, do you hear me?
We're gonna be stranded here.

01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:36.120
Miss Darrow was a great gal, no question.

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:38.330
And she was a wonderful person.

01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:41.620
It's a terrible loss
and we're all gonna miss her.

01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:45.830
I always knew you were nothing like
the tough guy you play on screen.

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:47.630
I just never figured you for a coward.

01:31:47.710 --> 01:31:49.840
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:52.840
Heroes don't look like me,
not in the real world.

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:56.470
In the real world, they got bad teeth,
a bald spot, and a beer gut.

01:31:56.550 --> 01:32:00.050
I'm just an actor with a gun,
who's lost his motivation.

01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:03.010
Be seeing you.

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:05.600
Anyone else?

01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:09.100
-Well, see you.
-Come on.

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.970
No!

01:37:07.630 --> 01:37:09.090
I said no!

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.310
That's all there is. There isn't any more.

01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:45.300
Get them off the boat.
Get them off the boat.

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:49.060
Keep paddling.

01:40:27.010 --> 01:40:28.930
What the hell was that?

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.340
Come on. Get them out of there!

01:41:14.130 --> 01:41:15.470
Preston!

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.260
Give me your hand.

01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:24.060
Jack!

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:30.810
Jack!

01:41:35.610 --> 01:41:36.900
-Choy!
-Help!

01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:39.030
Swim, you filthy bugger.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.500
Choy!

01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:52.420
Stay with him.

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.920
Swim to shore as fast as you can!

01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:55.090
Hold on. Preston!

01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.130
Whatever happens,
don't let go of the camera!

01:42:58.220 --> 01:42:59.800
Don't let go of the camera!

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.390
Come on, get up out of that water.

01:43:10.890 --> 01:43:12.190
Get up!

01:43:51.970 --> 01:43:53.470
Come on, come on.

01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:07.770
Preston. Preston.

01:44:19.450 --> 01:44:20.660
It's working.

01:44:39.010 --> 01:44:41.010
Did you get that, did you?

01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:42.680
No!

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:44.690
No.

01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:50.060
No.

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.820
What is it?

01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:47.690
Mr Hayes?

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:53.820
If anything happens, I want you to run.

01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:55.830
You understand?

01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:59.330
I'm not a coward. I ain't gonna run.

01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:03.120
It's not about being brave, Jimmy.

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.520
Go back!

01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:35.900
Back across the log!

01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:38.690
-I ain't gonna run!
-Get Jimmy out of here!

01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:40.450
-No!
-Get back! Get back!

01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:46.200
Move back!

01:47:59.170 --> 01:48:01.550
-No! No!
-Stay back.

01:48:04.050 --> 01:48:05.130
No!

01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:11.890
Look at me.

01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:16.640
-Let him go!
-You got to run, Jimmy.

01:48:20.850 --> 01:48:22.350
Do as I say.

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:24.900
Go with Jack.

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.820
Run!

01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:34.410
-No!
-Shoot him!

01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:54.670
Here! Over here!

01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:14.860
Hold on! Hold on!

01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:21.570
Lumpy! Help me!

01:49:23.450 --> 01:49:24.860
Bloody hell, Choy!

01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:47.540
No!

01:54:51.710 --> 01:54:52.920
Oh, my!

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.620
Wait!

02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:20.320
Carl.

02:02:25.290 --> 02:02:27.000
Jimmy. Jimmy.

02:02:29.710 --> 02:02:31.170
You all right?

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:22.370
No.

02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:16.500
Get off! Get it off!

02:04:24.050 --> 02:04:25.180
Get off!

02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:40.400
Get it off!

02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:42.520
Get it off! Get it off!

02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:47.240
Kill it!

02:05:59.170 --> 02:06:00.590
Stop moving!

02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:22.350
Get it off my face!

02:06:23.310 --> 02:06:25.730
-Stay still.
-I am standing still.

02:06:28.230 --> 02:06:30.030
-Hold on.
-Be careful!

02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:07.510
Don't move!
Stay away from the walls!

02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:09.680
Coming through!

02:07:18.150 --> 02:07:20.730
Get out of there now! Climb!

02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:30.030
Nobody get in my way.

02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:34.750
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

02:07:34.830 --> 02:07:37.710
Get up the rope. Let's go. Hurry up.

02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:06.100
Jimmy, let's go.

02:08:10.730 --> 02:08:12.320
-Come on.
-Okay.

02:08:15.530 --> 02:08:16.650
Go.

02:08:21.490 --> 02:08:23.370
Just as you go down...

02:08:24.410 --> 02:08:26.700
for the third and final time...

02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:30.670
as your head disappears
beneath the waves...

02:08:31.250 --> 02:08:33.670
and your lungs fill with water...

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:38.210
do you know what happens in those
last precious seconds before you drown?

02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:41.340
Come on, buddy. Get up the rope.
Come on. Get out of here. Come on.

02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:44.090
Your whole life passes before your eyes.

02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:46.640
And if you've lived as a true American...

02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:48.760
you get to watch it all in colour.

02:08:49.970 --> 02:08:51.600
Oh, and you will.

02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:54.350
Now, why don't you climb up the rope, huh?
Come on.

02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:01.650
Come on, Driscoll. Let's go.

02:11:56.290 --> 02:11:57.830
It's beautiful.

02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:20.600
Beautiful.

02:12:32.110 --> 02:12:33.450
Beautiful.

02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:22.030
There.

02:13:25.110 --> 02:13:28.200
-Thank God.
-Don't thank God. Thank Mr Baxter.

02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:30.660
He insisted on a rescue mission.

02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:35.120
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:38.660
That's the thing about cockroaches.

02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:42.170
No matter how many times
you flush them down the toilet...

02:13:42.250 --> 02:13:44.750
they always crawl back up the bowl.

02:13:45.670 --> 02:13:48.510
Hey, buddy? I'm out of the bowl.

02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:52.550
I'm drying off my wings
and trekking across the lid.

02:13:59.890 --> 02:14:01.140
Driscoll!

02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:06.270
Don't be a fool! Give it up. It's useless!

02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:08.900
She's dead.

02:14:11.690 --> 02:14:13.280
She's not dead.

02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:19.410
Jack's gonna bring her back...

02:14:20.370 --> 02:14:22.990
and the ape will be hard on his heels.

02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:26.410
We can still come out of this thing okay.

02:14:28.830 --> 02:14:30.370
More than okay.

02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:33.210
Think about it.

02:14:33.290 --> 02:14:36.960
You got a boat full of chloroform
we could put to good use.

02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:38.920
You wanna trap the ape?

02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:47.390
I don't think so.

02:14:47.970 --> 02:14:51.390
Isn't that what you do? Live animal capture?

02:14:52.890 --> 02:14:54.930
I heard you were the best.

02:15:02.770 --> 02:15:03.900
Jack!

02:15:06.990 --> 02:15:08.740
Look after yourself!

02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:11.320
Keep the gate open, will you?

02:15:11.410 --> 02:15:13.070
Sure thing, buddy.

02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:15.160
Good luck!

02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:29.800
I'm sorry.

02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:09.719
Ann.

02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:19.320
Jack!

02:19:20.190 --> 02:19:21.320
Run!

02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:53.220
Jack, Jack!

02:20:00.930 --> 02:20:02.100
Jack.

02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:13.110
Ann, it's okay.

02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:16.400
Ann, let's go. Let's go. Come on!

02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:31.250
Let's go. Come on.

02:20:31.710 --> 02:20:32.960
Come on!

02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:06.280
Carl!

02:22:06.450 --> 02:22:09.370
Please! Somebody help us!

02:22:11.290 --> 02:22:12.790
They've gone.

02:22:14.330 --> 02:22:16.420
Carl. Christ.

02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:18.080
Carl!

02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:21.090
Drop the bridge.
Do it now, for Christ's sake!

02:22:21.170 --> 02:22:22.380
Not yet.

02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:24.920
Wait.

02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:26.680
Wait.

02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:31.930
Wait!

02:22:42.650 --> 02:22:43.860
Come on!

02:23:56.330 --> 02:23:57.830
-Now!
-Throw them!

02:23:57.920 --> 02:23:59.290
Throw!

02:24:00.170 --> 02:24:01.210
No!

02:24:03.550 --> 02:24:04.800
Hold him!

02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:06.880
Are you out of your mind?

02:24:15.050 --> 02:24:17.220
-Stop!
-Hold the line!

02:24:17.930 --> 02:24:19.350
Keep him down!

02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:26.560
Heave!

02:24:26.940 --> 02:24:28.270
Please!

02:24:28.730 --> 02:24:30.440
No! Stop!

02:24:30.780 --> 02:24:31.860
Jack.

02:24:33.490 --> 02:24:34.820
-No.
-Get her out of....

02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:36.570
-They'll kill him!
-There's nothing we can do.

02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:38.110
-No!
-Get her out of his sight!

02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:40.120
-It's too late.
-Throw it!

02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:43.490
Look out!

02:24:45.790 --> 02:24:47.290
Let go of me.

02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:53.040
We gotta go. Come on.

02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:54.790
-Come on.
-Stop it.

02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:56.420
Leave me alone!

02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:59.130
Ann, please come on.

02:25:06.430 --> 02:25:08.260
-Kill it!
-No. No!

02:25:08.470 --> 02:25:10.720
It's over, you goddamn lunatic!

02:25:12.930 --> 02:25:14.480
All of you, run!

02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:16.190
Come on. Come on!

02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:34.740
Look out!

02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:47.170
Move it! Move it!

02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:50.880
Come on, come on!

02:25:59.810 --> 02:26:01.430
-Stay there!
-It's me he wants!

02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:03.680
-Please stop this!
-Move! Hold onto her!

02:26:03.770 --> 02:26:06.440
-Ann, go.
-Please, I can stop this!

02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:08.020
-No!
-Ann, stay there!

02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:11.900
Get it out!

02:26:14.650 --> 02:26:16.530
Get the hell out of here!

02:26:16.610 --> 02:26:18.570
-Come on!
-Jimmy, don't be crazy! Come on.

02:26:18.650 --> 02:26:19.950
Don't be crazy.

02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:22.240
Let me go!

02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:25.030
Cast off!

02:26:27.370 --> 02:26:28.620
Come on, Carl!

02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:31.920
-Row!
- Wait.

02:26:32.210 --> 02:26:34.330
Row, God damn it!

02:26:44.550 --> 02:26:45.720
Go back.

02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:53.720
Jimmy, no!

02:27:00.730 --> 02:27:01.770
No!

02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:21.210
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

02:27:21.290 --> 02:27:22.790
Hide out in back!

02:27:44.770 --> 02:27:46.430
-Wait!
-No!

02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:49.730
No! No! Please don't!

02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:50.450
The whole world will pay to see this.

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:55.200
We're millionaires, boys!

02:29:55.500 --> 02:29:57.710
I'll share it with all of you!

02:29:58.210 --> 02:30:02.710
In a few months, his name
will be up in lights on Broadway!

02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:09.010
Kong! The Eighth Wonder of the World!

02:31:09.890 --> 02:31:11.180
Mr Denham!

02:31:12.270 --> 02:31:14.310
What can I say? What can I say?

02:31:14.390 --> 02:31:15.770
Any comments, Mr Denham?

02:31:17.100 --> 02:31:18.770
The Mayor, thank you.

02:31:19.940 --> 02:31:21.020
Ready.

02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:22.440
What am l?

02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:24.610
Thank you very much.

02:31:28.450 --> 02:31:29.950
Get used to it.

02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:33.330
-Listen, it's great to see you. Ready?
-I'm really appreciating that....

02:31:33.410 --> 02:31:34.870
-Look at you!
-I remember you.

02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:37.950
-You're a lucky guy, Denham.
-Am I a lucky guy?

02:31:38.040 --> 02:31:39.830
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:54.800
Carl!

02:31:56.680 --> 02:31:57.850
-Zelman!
-I told them.

02:31:57.930 --> 02:31:59.350
I know you did and I appreciate it.

02:31:59.430 --> 02:32:01.390
Let's get a shot of this.

02:32:01.930 --> 02:32:03.060
Come on.

02:32:03.810 --> 02:32:06.440
-Big smile.
-Yeah! That's great!

02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:11.440
Look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.

02:32:12.190 --> 02:32:14.690
-No woman is worth this.
-This woman is worth it.

02:32:14.780 --> 02:32:16.780
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.

02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:18.070
Oh, really?

02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:19.820
She's not gonna buy this for a second.

02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:22.070
Shut up and hand me the grapefruit!

02:32:24.200 --> 02:32:26.870
You're writing a comedy?
Yes, I am.

02:32:27.620 --> 02:32:29.540
I'm writing it for you.

02:32:31.500 --> 02:32:33.370
Why would you do that?

02:32:34.380 --> 02:32:36.750
Why would I write a play for you?

02:32:40.170 --> 02:32:41.800
Isn't it obvious?

02:32:42.050 --> 02:32:43.550
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:32:44.800 --> 02:32:47.010
I couldn't help but overhear.

02:32:50.180 --> 02:32:52.890
So, he took me to
this fancy French restaurant...

02:32:52.970 --> 02:32:55.770
and halfway through the
hors d'oeuvres, he clutches my hand.

02:32:55.850 --> 02:32:58.060
And that's when he told you how he felt?

02:32:58.140 --> 02:33:00.850
-No. He never said it.
-He never said it?

02:33:00.940 --> 02:33:02.900
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.

02:33:02.980 --> 02:33:04.980
Well, then how does she know that it's real?

02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:08.530
-He said it was not about the words.
-Oh, please!

02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:12.860
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.

02:33:13.240 --> 02:33:17.530
He said we'd talk about it later.
Only there was no later.

02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:20.910
It never happened.

02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:23.580
That's how it ended.

02:33:23.750 --> 02:33:27.460
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?

02:33:29.340 --> 02:33:32.710
I honestly believed
things might actually work out...

02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:35.800
which was really very...

02:33:39.090 --> 02:33:40.300
foolish.

02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:43.180
Men. Oh, they'll give you the world...

02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:45.640
but they let the one thing
that truly matters...

02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:47.600
slip through their fingers.

02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:48.940
Typical.

02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:53.190
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use their brains.

02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:56.070
Romance. Who needs it?

02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:22.130
Thank you.

02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:24.340
Thank you.

02:34:27.260 --> 02:34:28.590
Thank you.

02:34:30.430 --> 02:34:31.760
Thank you.

02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:35.470
Ladies and gentlemen...

02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:39.480
I'm here to tell you a very strange story.

02:34:39.930 --> 02:34:42.150
The story of our adventure...

02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:45.690
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths...

02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:48.150
their lives lost...

02:34:48.690 --> 02:34:50.990
in pursuit of a savage beast...

02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:54.570
a monstrous aberration of nature.

02:34:55.780 --> 02:34:58.490
But even the meanest brute can be tamed.

02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:01.370
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, as you will see...

02:35:01.450 --> 02:35:03.450
the beast was no match...

02:35:03.700 --> 02:35:05.710
for the charms of a girl.

02:35:08.750 --> 02:35:10.630
A girl from New York...

02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:15.340
who melted his heart...

02:35:16.050 --> 02:35:18.920
bringing to mind that old Arabian proverb...

02:35:20.590 --> 02:35:23.970
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty...

02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:26.930
"and beauty stayed his hand.

02:35:27.970 --> 02:35:31.850
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."

02:35:39.650 --> 02:35:43.110
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you...

02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:46.240
the greatest thing
your eyes have ever beheld.

02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:52.030
He was a king in the world he knew,
but he comes to you now a captive.

02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:54.910
Ladies and gentlemen...

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:59.540
I give you Kong,
The Eighth Wonder of the World!

02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:12.010
Don't be alarmed. It's perfectly safe.

02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:15.760
These chains are made of chrome steel!

02:36:36.530 --> 02:36:38.320
Observe, if you will...

02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:43.530
I am touching the beast.

02:36:43.870 --> 02:36:48.080
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.

02:36:55.210 --> 02:36:56.880
Crank them up, fellas.

02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:18.400
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight...

02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:20.060
a surprise guest.

02:37:20.900 --> 02:37:23.280
The real-life hero of this story.

02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:26.190
The man who hunted down
the mighty Kong!

02:37:27.570 --> 02:37:32.370
The man who risked all to win
the freedom of a helpless female.

02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:35.870
A big hand for Mr Bruce Baxter!

02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:43.580
Thank you. Thank you.

02:37:44.580 --> 02:37:45.920
Thank you.

02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:14.780
He was right.

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:19.860
About there still being some mystery
left in this world...

02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:22.820
and we can all have a piece of it...

02:38:22.950 --> 02:38:25.530
for the price of an admission ticket.

02:38:26.790 --> 02:38:29.830
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.

02:38:31.210 --> 02:38:34.620
His unfailing ability
to destroy the things he loves.

02:38:49.050 --> 02:38:51.640
Please remain calm, ladies and gentlemen...

02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:55.020
for we now come
to the climax of this savage ritual.

02:38:55.220 --> 02:38:57.940
The sacrifice of a beautiful young girl.

02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:02.150
Behold her terror as she is
offered up to the mighty Kong!

02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:07.440
A big hand, folks,
for the bravest girl I've ever met!

02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:09.780
Miss Ann Darrow.

02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:59.150
Save me from the beast!

02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:09.240
Help me!

02:40:13.370 --> 02:40:14.870
Where is she?

02:40:15.870 --> 02:40:17.420
-Where's Ann?
-I have no idea.

02:40:17.500 --> 02:40:20.880
I heard he offered her all kinds of
money and she turned him down flat.

02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:25.670
Pack up all my cares and woe

02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:28.880
Here I go

02:40:30.220 --> 02:40:31.890
Singing low

02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:36.180
Bye bye

02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:39.980
Blackbird

02:40:45.230 --> 02:40:49.570
Where somebody waits for me

02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:52.610
Sugar's sweet

02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:55.820
So is he

02:40:58.160 --> 02:40:59.870
Bye bye

02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:04.580
Blackbird

02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:08.040
Here's your story, boys.

02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:11.210
"Beauty and the man
who saved her from the beast."

02:41:26.260 --> 02:41:28.140
We have to get these people out of here.

02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:30.730
Everyone needs to leave, okay? Come on.

02:41:31.930 --> 02:41:34.520
Let him roar. It makes a swell picture.

02:41:35.980 --> 02:41:37.020
Head for the exits.

02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:39.900
Get your own seat, buddy.
You're not having mine.

02:41:47.700 --> 02:41:49.160
Excuse me, fellows.

02:41:49.870 --> 02:41:52.580
Coming through. Coming through, fellows.

02:41:56.120 --> 02:41:59.120
Get me down! Help me, please!

02:42:01.540 --> 02:42:04.460
Somebody! Somebody help me!

02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:10.510
Go! Go! Get out!

02:42:14.470 --> 02:42:15.970
Go! Go!

02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:53.420
There they are. Come on, come with me.

02:44:06.180 --> 02:44:07.850
Go!
Wait for me!

02:44:08.770 --> 02:44:10.150
Go back!

02:44:17.150 --> 02:44:18.400
This way!

02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:27.370
Help!

02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:36.920
No!

02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:19.330
Taxi! Follow that ape.

02:45:19.410 --> 02:45:20.910
Come on, pal, we gotta draw him off.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:22.790
It's all yours, buddy.

02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:40.890
Better get out of here, lady!

02:46:01.650 --> 02:46:02.900
Come on.

02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:13.200
Buddy!

02:46:14.410 --> 02:46:16.620
Come on. Come on.

02:46:35.430 --> 02:46:36.680
Look out.

02:46:59.490 --> 02:47:00.740
Jesus Christ.

02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:24.880
Fire!

02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:28.380
Stop!

02:52:43.940 --> 02:52:45.400
Listen up.

02:52:45.480 --> 02:52:48.440
This is New York City,
and this is sacred ground.

02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:49.980
You hear me?

02:52:50.610 --> 02:52:53.240
It was built for humans, by humans.

02:52:53.320 --> 02:52:55.650
Not for stinking lice-infested apes.

02:52:55.900 --> 02:52:57.660
The thought of some mutant gorilla...

02:52:57.740 --> 02:53:02.450
crapping all over the streets of this fair city,
fills me with disgust.

02:53:02.540 --> 02:53:04.540
So this is how it's gonna be.

02:53:04.620 --> 02:53:06.960
We find it. We kill it.

02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:10.290
We cut its ugly head off and we ram it up....

02:53:30.310 --> 02:53:32.180
No. No.

02:56:03.390 --> 02:56:04.720
Beautiful.

02:56:11.150 --> 02:56:12.230
Yes.

02:56:14.860 --> 02:56:16.230
Yes, it is.

03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:10.930
Look at that.

03:01:12.770 --> 03:01:13.890
Hey! Hey!

03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:16.100
Nobody past this point.

03:01:17.020 --> 03:01:18.940
You can't go in there!

03:01:23.110 --> 03:01:24.400
Stop him!

03:01:27.490 --> 03:01:29.780
Hey! Get back. You're not allowed up there!

03:01:29.860 --> 03:01:31.490
-What's going on?
-Go!

03:05:13.330 --> 03:05:14.630
No!

03:05:15.800 --> 03:05:18.840
No!

03:05:24.930 --> 03:05:27.550
Please! No!

03:05:27.930 --> 03:05:29.060
No!

03:08:25.700 --> 03:08:27.990
Ann. Ann.

03:09:17.320 --> 03:09:18.620
Move along.

03:09:19.080 --> 03:09:20.990
Just one shot! One shot!

03:09:21.660 --> 03:09:23.750
-Come, come!
-Boys, how about a photo?

03:09:23.830 --> 03:09:24.870
Look at me.

03:09:24.950 --> 03:09:26.710
Come on, watch the camera.

03:09:29.500 --> 03:09:31.040
Come a little closer.

03:09:31.710 --> 03:09:33.880
That's it, folks. Show's over. Step back!

03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:36.170
Clear the area. That's it. Shove off, boys.

03:09:36.880 --> 03:09:38.420
Why'd he do that?

03:09:38.720 --> 03:09:41.220
Climb up there and get himself cornered.

03:09:41.300 --> 03:09:43.600
The ape must have known what was coming.

03:09:43.680 --> 03:09:46.350
He's just a dumb animal.
Didn't know nothing.

03:09:52.560 --> 03:09:55.270
What does it matter? Airplanes got him.

03:09:57.860 --> 03:09:59.820
It wasn't the airplanes.

03:10:04.200 --> 03:10:06.490
It was beauty killed the beast.
