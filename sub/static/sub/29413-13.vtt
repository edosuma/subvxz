WEBVTT

00:09.313 --> 00:11.185
Okay, Grover,
this is it.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.056
If the kicker misses,
we stay alive,

00:13.100 --> 00:15.276
and those losers go home.

00:15.319 --> 00:18.235
But... if he misses,
won't he feel sad?

00:18.279 --> 00:20.324
Yeah, he'll be devastated.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.587
It's my favorite part
of football.

00:23.936 --> 00:26.330
Okay, here comes
the kick.

00:28.506 --> 00:29.986
Yes! No good!

00:30.030 --> 00:31.553
No good!

00:31.596 --> 00:32.771
Ha! That's so good!

00:32.815 --> 00:34.469
Look at his...
look at his face.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.123
Oh, what happened?

00:36.166 --> 00:37.167
The kicker missed
the field goal.

00:37.211 --> 00:39.039
Aw. He must feel so sad.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.129
Is Tina still at church?

00:42.172 --> 00:43.782
It's getting
kind of late.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.480
Yeah, she's
on the selection committee

00:45.523 --> 00:47.308
to choose a new pastor.

00:47.351 --> 00:49.179
She really likes
this latest candidate.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.747
Ooh, is he the "fire
and brimstone" type,

00:51.790 --> 00:53.749
or more of a hip,
guitar-playing dude

00:53.792 --> 00:55.577
who's down with the G-O-D?

00:56.621 --> 00:58.580
I haven't met him.

00:58.623 --> 01:01.017
But Tina spending Sundays
at church

01:01.061 --> 01:03.933
lets this dude be down
with the NFL.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.196
And if that's
not the Lord's work,

01:06.240 --> 01:08.590
I don't know what is.

01:10.418 --> 01:11.636
Oh.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.855
Hey, guys.

01:12.898 --> 01:14.509
This is Pastor Don.

01:14.552 --> 01:17.512
Pastor Don, this is
my lovely husband, Calvin,

01:17.555 --> 01:19.035
our neighbor Dave
and his son Grover.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.471
Hi. How are you?Hi.

01:20.515 --> 01:21.777
It's nice to
meet you all.

01:21.820 --> 01:24.127
So, uh...

01:24.171 --> 01:27.478
what brings you by, Pastor,

01:27.522 --> 01:30.873
just before
the late game starts?

01:30.916 --> 01:33.658
Well, I invited him to join us
for Sunday dinner.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.399
There.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.923
Whoa, whoa, Tina,
what are you doing?

01:37.967 --> 01:40.491
I didn't invite the pastor
over here to watch football.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.406
I brought him here
to get to know us better.

01:42.450 --> 01:45.496
Well, let me start
by letting you know

01:45.540 --> 01:49.109
how much I love football.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.415
Calvin.

01:52.721 --> 01:53.417
Fine.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.158
Hey.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.855
That's the same face
the kicker made.

01:58.857 --> 02:00.772
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:00.816 --> 02:01.817
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.693
So, Pastor Don,
congratulations

02:08.737 --> 02:10.130
on your new job.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.174
Or should I say...

02:11.218 --> 02:12.654
"Job."

02:15.439 --> 02:16.701
So, uh,

02:16.745 --> 02:19.443
blasphemy's okay,
but I can't watch football?

02:21.184 --> 02:23.055
You know, the truth is,
I-I don't have the job yet.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.144
I'm still on a trial run.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.234
All right, everyone,
dinner is served.

02:27.277 --> 02:30.672
All right. You know,
if we cut down on the chitchat,

02:30.715 --> 02:33.109
we can be done by halftime.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.199
Okay, so, Pastor,
why don't you sit here

02:36.243 --> 02:38.070
at the head of the table?
Right, Calvin?

02:41.161 --> 02:43.598
Of course.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.556
Well, here, take my seat.
I left it nice and warm for you.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.692
Okay, so, Pastor Don,

02:50.735 --> 02:52.563
would you do the honor
of saying grace?

02:52.607 --> 02:54.304
My pleasure.Ah.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.960
Father God, we ask
that you bless this meal,

02:58.003 --> 02:59.614
everyone here,

02:59.657 --> 03:01.355
and especially bless

03:01.398 --> 03:02.660
Sister Tina,Mm-hmm.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.053
the one who made it.

03:08.797 --> 03:11.147
Can you throw in something
about my spelling test tomorrow?

03:13.062 --> 03:14.455
Grover.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.239
No, it's okay.
I like the boy's spirit.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.936
Hey, you all should join us
at church on Sunday.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.242
We'd love to!

03:19.286 --> 03:20.939
Ooh, I've always
wanted to wear

03:20.983 --> 03:22.985
one of those big
fancy church hats.

03:23.028 --> 03:25.074
And now I finally have
a big fancy chance.

03:27.294 --> 03:28.904
Ah, look at that,
table neighbor.

03:28.947 --> 03:31.950
The Lord just keeps
bringing us together.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.039
God is good.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.434
Yes, He is.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.871
No matter what Sister Rose said
about Him at Bible study.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.092
Hey, what-what'd she say?

03:44.615 --> 03:45.790
Oh, it's a long story.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.401
You had to be there.

03:47.444 --> 03:50.186
But your comeback
was hilarious.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.711
Wha... What was your comeback?

03:53.755 --> 03:56.279
Oh...

03:56.323 --> 03:58.150
Baby, you had to be there
for that, too.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.458
Well, I'm glad Iwas.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.460
Sister Rose was so embarrassed,

04:03.504 --> 04:05.288
she pretended
she was speaking in tongues.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.204
That... that's funny.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.424
You know what it reminds me of,

04:10.467 --> 04:12.513
is last week in the supermarket
when the checkout guy said,

04:12.556 --> 04:14.254
"ketchup sauce."

04:14.297 --> 04:16.038
Remember that, Tina?

04:16.081 --> 04:17.213
Uh-huh. That was funny, too.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.391
: Man,
I wish I was there.

04:21.435 --> 04:22.958
Ah, "ketchup sauce."

04:23.001 --> 04:25.003
That sounds hysterical.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.007
You know, you all have
such a lovely home.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.314
How would you feel about
hosting Bible study here

04:31.358 --> 04:32.707
this Thursday night?

04:32.750 --> 04:34.926
We'd love to!We would?

04:36.580 --> 04:39.017
Yeah. I mean,
yeah, we would. Yeah.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.154
Oh-ho-ho!

04:45.197 --> 04:47.461
Ha-ha!Damn it!

04:47.504 --> 04:50.507
It's like you knew I
was gonna do a fake punt.I did.

04:50.551 --> 04:54.424
You literally just said,
"Watch this fake punt."

04:54.468 --> 04:57.122
I was talking to my team.
Quit listening to my huddle!

05:00.212 --> 05:01.562
Uh, what was that?

05:01.605 --> 05:02.911
That's my new
upstairs neighbor.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.131
Man, that has got
to be annoying.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.524
Yeah, that's not all.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.439
Yesterday he parked
his pickup truck

05:09.483 --> 05:11.963
so close to my car,
I had to climb out
through the trunk.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.965
Oh, man. Wait, do you
have security cameras

05:14.009 --> 05:16.881
in your garage?Oh, you mean so I
could show the landlord?

05:16.925 --> 05:19.493
No. So I can watch you
squeeze your nerdy ass
out of that trunk.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.019
Hey, Calvin.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.890
Oh, hey, Gemma.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.676
It was so nice getting to know
Pastor Don last night.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.504
He's very charming.

05:30.547 --> 05:31.722
Yeah, he's fine.

05:33.463 --> 05:36.771
Uh-oh. That's the same "fine"
Dave's mom gave me

05:36.814 --> 05:40.296
when I asked her how I looked
in my wedding dress.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.299
You know, I just don't like
how chummy he is with Tina.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.780
Did you see him
hold her hand at dinner?

05:45.823 --> 05:48.304
Calvin, we were saying grace.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.872
Well, did you see what he did
after dinner?

05:50.915 --> 05:53.875
What kind of pastor
drinks scotch?

05:53.918 --> 05:56.094
You offered it to him.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.358
As a test-- which he failed.

06:00.316 --> 06:01.578
I don't know,

06:01.622 --> 06:03.580
this guy's up to no good.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.887
Well, to be honest,
I know how you feel.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.976
You do?Yeah.

06:08.019 --> 06:10.065
Women are always throwing
themselves at Dave.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.243
Did you date another Dave
before this one?

06:16.463 --> 06:19.814
I'm just saying, if your gut's
telling you something, trust it.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.076
Yeah, you're right.

06:21.119 --> 06:23.600
I need to keep an eye on him.

06:23.644 --> 06:26.211
Hmm. It's not easy,
but it's the price we pay

06:26.255 --> 06:28.213
for falling in love
with hotties.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.217
All right.

06:32.261 --> 06:35.090
Now, if I can trap him
into taking my bishop,

06:35.133 --> 06:37.309
I can take his queen.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.573
Ha! Now you're talking
to yourself.

06:41.096 --> 06:42.445
Actually, I was
talking to you.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.578
Ha. Checkmate.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.277
Yo, seriously,

06:48.320 --> 06:50.453
you haven't taken care
of this cowboy yet?

06:50.497 --> 06:51.933
I sure did.
I confronted the guy

06:51.976 --> 06:53.108
and told him what's what.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.502
Oh, you did?Yes.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.547
Via a friendly note
I slid under his door.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.331
But I think

06:59.375 --> 07:02.726
the Starbucks gift card sent
quite a message.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.468
Marty, you have backed down
from stuff your whole life.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.949
Remember your first day at USC
when one of your professors

07:07.992 --> 07:10.125
called you Morty, and
you never corrected him?

07:10.168 --> 07:11.692
It wasn't that big a deal.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.389
Your diploma says
Morton Butler!

07:22.398 --> 07:23.834
Okay, Marty, I
could go upstairs

07:23.878 --> 07:25.445
and take care of this
for your sorry ass.

07:25.488 --> 07:28.535
Yes, that'd be great.

07:28.578 --> 07:29.971
Come on, little bro,

07:30.014 --> 07:31.581
you can't keep running
from your problems forever.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.715
Think about it-- what
would Yoda tell you to do?

07:34.758 --> 07:37.239
I guess he'd say...

07:37.282 --> 07:39.371
Confront him, you should.

07:40.416 --> 07:41.548
Exactly.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.724
Then why are you
still standing here?

07:43.767 --> 07:45.726
Because stalling, I am.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.297
All right, everyone,
let's dig in and see

07:52.341 --> 07:54.561
what the Lord has to say
about helping those in need.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.476
But first,
what Ineed is another piece

07:56.519 --> 07:59.043
of Sister Tina's
delicious peach cobbler.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.654
Aw. Thank you, Pastor.

08:00.697 --> 08:03.047
Ask and you shall receive.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.180
Oh, thank you.

08:05.223 --> 08:08.052
Hey, everybody.
Sorry I'm late.

08:08.096 --> 08:09.706
Oh, baby,
what are you doing here?

08:09.750 --> 08:11.012
I thought you were playing poker
with the guys.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.883
I changed my mind.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.756
Tonight
I'm betting it all on God.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.758
Well, Brother Calvin,

08:17.801 --> 08:19.542
you came to the right place.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.371
And you're sitting
in the wrong one.
Okay, come on.

08:22.414 --> 08:23.546
Oh. Sorry.

08:25.592 --> 08:28.464
Now, to quote Jesus
after he rose from the dead:

08:28.508 --> 08:30.161
"What'd I miss?"

08:38.256 --> 08:41.085
I want to thank you both so
much for hosting tonight.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.565
No. Thank you.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.567
Your words were so inspiring.Oh, thank you.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.526
Good stuff, now.
All right.

08:48.484 --> 08:49.964
Thank you, Brother Calvin.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.531
Sister Tina,
I'll see you Sunday morning.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.054
Ooh, she'll be there.

08:53.097 --> 08:55.622
My wife-- 30 years, two kids!

08:56.884 --> 08:58.189
Hmm.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.365
We might even have another one!

09:02.367 --> 09:04.152
Calvin, what is wrong with you?

09:04.195 --> 09:06.720
You were acting so weird
during Bible study.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.591
Weird how?

09:08.635 --> 09:11.507
Well, first of all,
you were atBible study.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.337
All right, you want
to know the truth?

09:15.380 --> 09:17.252
I don't like
this Pastor Don guy.

09:17.295 --> 09:20.081
You know, I think
he got his eyes on you.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.909
Oh,
please, Calvin.

09:21.952 --> 09:23.737
He's just trying
to butter me up

09:23.780 --> 09:25.086
because I'm
on the selection committee.

09:25.129 --> 09:28.176
Nah, Tina. It's
more than that.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.873
This guy's a snake
in our garden,

09:29.917 --> 09:33.529
and he's trying to take a bite
of your apple.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.967
You said that
about our dry cleaner,

09:37.011 --> 09:38.839
the guy at the gas station,

09:38.882 --> 09:40.580
and our dentist.

09:40.623 --> 09:43.974
Well, he never told me
Ihad a beautiful smile.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.631
You know, Calvin, I don't have
time for this, all right?

09:48.675 --> 09:50.894
And for your information,
our dentist is gay.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.768
His husband thinks you have
a beautiful smile.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.294
You got this, okay?
You are the man,

09:59.337 --> 10:01.601
and you are about to shut
this chump down.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.214
Hello?

10:08.912 --> 10:10.914
Hello.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.220
Oh. Uh...

10:13.438 --> 10:15.136
H-Hi. Hi.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.703
I-I-I'm...

10:16.746 --> 10:18.095
I'm-I'm Morton.
I mean Morty.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.532
I-I mean, I am, um,

10:20.576 --> 10:22.578
Marty, your downstairs neighbor.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.971
I'm Keira.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.581
Oh.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.409
You're the guy
who left me that gift card.

10:27.452 --> 10:28.932
That was so thoughtful.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.891
Oh, it's no big deal.
You know, I would do it

10:30.934 --> 10:32.153
for anyone who was on top of me.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.545
I mean, uh,

10:33.589 --> 10:35.112
I mean, under-underneath you.
I mean...

10:35.156 --> 10:37.114
Ah... welcome
to the building.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.422
Thanks.

10:40.465 --> 10:41.858
Hey, uh, actually,

10:41.902 --> 10:43.555
if it's not too weird,
would you mind

10:43.599 --> 10:44.426
helping me with something?

10:44.469 --> 10:45.645
What? Are you kidding?

10:45.688 --> 10:47.211
If it's weird, I'm into it.

10:47.255 --> 10:48.735
I mean, uh,

10:48.778 --> 10:52.608
uh, I would be...
I'd be happy to help.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.176
I've been trying
to move furniture by myself.

10:55.219 --> 10:56.960
Sorry if I was
a little loud.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.962
Oh, not at all. In
fact, it was so quiet,

10:59.006 --> 11:00.747
I thought maybe a
mouse had moved in.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.010
Are you calling me short?

11:03.053 --> 11:05.708
What? No! No, I didn't
even notice your body.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.449
Well, I mean, I
noticed your body.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.713
So, you needed some
help with something?

11:10.757 --> 11:12.323
Yeah.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.325
Can you help me slide
this couch against the wall?

11:14.369 --> 11:15.892
It's too heavy to lift.Oh...

11:15.936 --> 11:17.241
Maybe it's too heavy
for you, but...

11:17.285 --> 11:18.329
Also for me.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.728
Oh! I'm coming,
baby bro, I'm coming!

11:25.772 --> 11:27.338
But I'm coming strapped!

11:30.124 --> 11:33.170
♪ I'm gonna lay down my burden

11:33.214 --> 11:35.346
♪ Down by the riverside...

11:35.390 --> 11:37.087
What are you doing?

11:37.131 --> 11:38.741
I'm prepping for church
with Calvin and Tina.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.090
♪ Down by the riverside...

11:40.134 --> 11:42.266
Why?

11:42.310 --> 11:44.399
Well, because it's
gonna be different

11:44.442 --> 11:46.357
from the church
that we go to,

11:46.401 --> 11:47.881
and I want to be respectful.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.274
Which is why I watched a
bunch of YouTube videos,

11:50.318 --> 11:53.756
Sister Act,and
eight Madea movies.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.585
Whoa!

11:56.628 --> 11:59.849
Are you gonna do backflips
down the aisle like that nun?

12:01.982 --> 12:03.940
Grover, don't be silly.

12:03.984 --> 12:06.116
She's 80. I'm gonna get
way more air than her.

12:11.295 --> 12:12.688
Oh, hey, Calvin.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.559
Hey. Dave, is Gemma here?

12:14.603 --> 12:16.779
I need her to talk some sense
into Tina.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.303
Actually, she's at
a PTA meeting. What's going on?

12:19.347 --> 12:23.046
I'm pretty sure that Pastor Don
is making moves on Tina.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.526
What?

12:24.569 --> 12:25.919
Did something happen?

12:25.962 --> 12:28.182
I mean, not exactly,

12:28.225 --> 12:31.707
but he's made excuses to see
her every night this week.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.449
"Let's go visit the elderly."

12:36.799 --> 12:39.497
"Oh, come help me
feed the homeless."

12:40.890 --> 12:43.632
I'm telling you,
he's a bad dude.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.547
Okay.

12:45.590 --> 12:49.507
Uh, oris it possible
what you're actually upset about

12:49.551 --> 12:51.683
is that Pastor Don
is connecting with Tina

12:51.727 --> 12:53.250
in a way that you're not?

12:53.294 --> 12:55.296
That's crazy.

12:55.339 --> 12:59.604
Is it? Look, Tina's church life
is obviously important to her,

12:59.648 --> 13:02.129
and maybe Pastor Don
is just filling a void

13:02.172 --> 13:03.652
that you choose not to.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.263
I don't know.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.743
Maybe.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.572
Remember, Calvin.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.792
"Don't judge
or you will be judged."

13:14.054 --> 13:15.838
Wow, Dave.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.797
I didn't know
you knew scripture so well.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.582
Actually, I-I got that
from Whoopi Goldberg.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.587
I'm so sorry.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.850
Is your foot okay?Oh, it's fine.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.243
Pinky toes are totally cosmetic.

13:31.506 --> 13:34.596
Get your damn hands
off my brother, you...

13:36.511 --> 13:38.687
...surprisingly tiny lady.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.429
Uh, Keira, this is

13:41.472 --> 13:43.561
my brother, Malcolm.
Malcolm, this is Keira.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.172

13:45.215 --> 13:46.738

13:46.782 --> 13:48.871

13:50.917 --> 13:51.874
Nice to meet you.Yeah.

13:51.918 --> 13:52.962
What's with the rocket?

13:53.006 --> 13:55.747
Oh. Um, it's a, uh...

13:55.791 --> 13:58.315

Uh, yep.

14:01.449 --> 14:04.756
Yep. Uh, signed by Buzz Aldrin
and everything.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.890
Well, thank you.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.893
Hey, you guys
are my first houseguests.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.113
Let me get some beers
to celebrate.MALCOLM: Okay.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.944
She is cute.

14:17.987 --> 14:20.424
Yeah, I know. Thank you
for making me come up here.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.774
Yeah, you see what happens
when you stand up for yourself?

14:22.818 --> 14:25.560
Yeah, man. In
fact, I'm gonna do it now.

14:25.603 --> 14:26.735

and just try to blend in.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.593
Oh, my God.
Look at all these hats.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.551
I knew I shouldn't have gotten
the small one.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.338
Okay, I'm warning you, Calvin.

15:04.381 --> 15:07.558
You better not embarrass me
in front of Pastor Don.

15:07.602 --> 15:10.344
Don't worry, I won't.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.868
I think maybe I was...

15:12.912 --> 15:14.304
wrong about him.

15:14.348 --> 15:17.829
Wait, did you just admit
to being wrong?

15:17.873 --> 15:20.832
Okay, God, a deal's a deal.
I'm-a stop cursing.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.749
Hey, uh,

15:24.793 --> 15:26.316
I'm-a catch up with
you in a second.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.710
Okay, baby.Brother Calvin,
good to see you.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.842
Are the Rams not playing today?

15:32.627 --> 15:35.325
Well, I decided that
this was more important.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.110
Plus, it's a night game.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.764
Listen,

15:39.808 --> 15:41.679
I... I just wanted
to apologize

15:41.723 --> 15:43.681
about my behavior
at Bible study.

15:43.725 --> 15:47.555
The truth is is that
I had this crazy idea

15:47.598 --> 15:50.645
that you was making
moves on my wife.

15:50.688 --> 15:51.994
You did?

15:52.038 --> 15:54.562
Yeah, you know how
us guys can be.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.564
Yeah. Well, you have
nothing to apologize for.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.087
I completely understand.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.654
Thanks, Pastor.

15:59.697 --> 16:02.483
After all, Sister Tina's
a very attractive woman.

16:05.877 --> 16:08.184
Excuse me?

16:08.228 --> 16:09.751
As scripture says,

16:09.794 --> 16:13.015
"He who finds a good wife
finds a good thing."

16:13.059 --> 16:15.670
Obviously,
Tina's a good wife,

16:15.713 --> 16:18.542
but I'm more interested
in the bad ones.

Today's message comes
from the Book of Revelations.

17:13.249 --> 17:14.598
You got that right.

17:16.383 --> 17:20.561

CONGREGATION:
Mm-hmm. Amen.I see your ass.

17:26.088 --> 17:29.265
Which is why we must stay
vigilant against temptation.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.571
That's right.

17:30.614 --> 17:34.314
Walk the righteous path
and cast out

17:34.357 --> 17:35.793
those who lead us astray.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.708
No way. I heard enough.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.101
I need to testify.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.843
Let Him use you, Calvin!

17:46.630 --> 17:49.285
Brother Calvin,
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

17:49.329 --> 17:52.027
but we normally don't testify
until the end of the service.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.334
Yeah, well, today is different,

17:54.377 --> 17:57.728
'cause there is a devil
among us.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.036
Thank you,
Brother Calvin.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.343
We'll look into that. Now,
if you open your Bibles to...

18:03.386 --> 18:05.084
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, I'm not done.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.827
We are in the presence
of a false prophet.

18:09.871 --> 18:13.048
A wolf in sheep's clothing.

18:13.092 --> 18:17.226
A man who covets
other men's wives.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.272
And I know that commandment
is important

18:19.315 --> 18:21.448
'cause it made the top ten list.

18:23.493 --> 18:26.322
And that man's name...

18:30.152 --> 18:31.545
...is Pastor Don.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.592
Let your light shine, Calvin!

18:38.856 --> 18:40.554
Did you watch
Sister Actagain?

18:40.597 --> 18:43.861
If loving Whoopi is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.082
Forgive Brother Calvin.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.692
He knows not what he says.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.955
I'm a man of deep faith

18:50.999 --> 18:53.741
who respects the sanctity
of marriage. I would never...

18:53.784 --> 18:55.569
Hold up!

18:55.612 --> 18:57.136
You got other women on the side?

18:59.094 --> 19:02.315
You told me I was the only woman
you were checking for.
