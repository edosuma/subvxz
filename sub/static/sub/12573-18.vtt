WEBVTT

00:08.919 --> 00:10.486
It's getting late.
I have to go.

00:10.554 --> 00:12.388
You're not going anywhere.
- Oh.

00:12.456 --> 00:14.290
Evil doesn't wait.

00:14.357 --> 00:16.525
Take me with you.

00:16.593 --> 00:18.727
It's too dangerous.

00:23.867 --> 00:26.007
When all this is over I'll
come back for you,

00:26.069 --> 00:27.369
I swear.

00:31.174 --> 00:33.609
Do you really love me?

00:33.677 --> 00:35.978
The Seeker never lies.

00:36.046 --> 00:38.280
Oh. Ha-ha!

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.158 --> 00:49.959
Where have you been?

00:50.026 --> 00:53.462
Uh, I got my foot caught
in a hunter's trap.

00:53.530 --> 00:56.932
Oh, I'm sure you got something
caught somewhere.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.767
We need to move now.

00:58.835 --> 01:00.202
<i>Please.</i>

01:00.270 --> 01:03.139
we've already paid
our tribute to Lord Rahl.

01:03.206 --> 01:05.174
The demand's been doubled.

01:05.242 --> 01:06.976
There's a war on,
as you may have noticed.

01:07.043 --> 01:08.777
If we give you more gold,

01:08.845 --> 01:11.447
we'll have no money
to buy seeds for our crops.

01:11.515 --> 01:13.282
We'll starve.

01:13.350 --> 01:15.484
And then Lord Rahl
will get nothing out of us.

01:15.552 --> 01:16.952
Maybe this town
would fare better

01:17.020 --> 01:18.854
with one less mouth to feed.

01:18.922 --> 01:21.190
Drop the sword.

01:44.548 --> 01:48.217
Confessor, let me live,
that I might serve you.

01:48.285 --> 01:51.587
How long you live depends
on how well you serve.

01:51.655 --> 01:53.222
Are there more of you coming?

01:53.290 --> 01:55.224
If I'm not back
with the tribute by nightfall,

01:55.292 --> 01:57.293
my commander will send
the Dragon Corps.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.261
And they won't just come back
for the tribute,

01:59.329 --> 02:01.063
they'll come
for the whole treasure,

02:01.131 --> 02:03.632
and they'll slaughter
anyone who tries to stop them.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.935
Please, Seeker,
you have to help us.

02:08.872 --> 02:11.373
People of Ixwood,
do not despair.

02:11.441 --> 02:12.942
Go to your houses,

02:13.009 --> 02:15.444
close the shutters,
bolt the doors.

02:15.512 --> 02:17.379
The Confessor and I will wait
in the treasury,

02:17.447 --> 02:18.881
when the rats walk
into the trap:

02:22.419 --> 02:23.819
Stand watch on the road.

02:23.887 --> 02:25.487
When you see
the Dragon Corps coming,

02:25.555 --> 02:26.922
race back here,

02:26.990 --> 02:28.824
knock three times
on the door of the treasury,

02:28.892 --> 02:32.795
and hide yourself. Go.

02:37.767 --> 02:40.569
Come, come! Ha-ha!

02:40.637 --> 02:42.771
This is a great day

02:42.839 --> 02:46.475
for the people of Ixwood.

02:46.543 --> 02:51.146
You have given us hope
in a dark time.

02:51.214 --> 02:55.517
Oh, be sure to thank your wife
for all this marvelous food.

02:55.585 --> 02:57.486
You can thank her yourself.

02:57.554 --> 03:00.222
Is there any other service
I can perform for the Seeker?

03:04.894 --> 03:06.795
Uh--

03:06.863 --> 03:10.299
Oh, I'm sure the Seeker
is more than grateful

03:10.367 --> 03:12.801
for the service
you've already provided.

03:12.869 --> 03:14.770
Thank you both for everything.

03:14.838 --> 03:17.406
The gratitude is ours.

03:27.984 --> 03:30.219
I hope for your sake she's
a better hunter's trap

03:30.287 --> 03:32.588
than she is a cook.

03:39.796 --> 03:42.598
Did the D'Harans come?

03:42.666 --> 03:44.500
Where's the Seeker?

03:44.567 --> 03:46.769
What if they killed him?

03:52.008 --> 03:53.208
Seeker!

03:56.079 --> 03:58.681
The Seeker hasn't been killed.

03:58.748 --> 04:00.115
He's tricked us!

04:00.183 --> 04:03.352
Summon the Town Guard.

04:03.420 --> 04:04.987
We've been robbed!

04:09.693 --> 04:11.193
What took you so long?

04:11.261 --> 04:12.895
You try running
in this corset.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.930
Was it the corset
that slowed you down,

04:14.998 --> 04:17.099
or the flagon of spirits
you guzzled last night?

04:17.166 --> 04:19.468
It was freezing.

04:19.536 --> 04:22.137
Funny how many cold nights
we've been having lately.

04:22.205 --> 04:25.507
I was beginning to think you'd
run off with the loot.

04:25.575 --> 04:27.343
You know you can trust us,
Gwildor.

04:28.978 --> 04:31.313
Well, I know I can trust you
to come back for this.

04:31.381 --> 04:33.148
Do we have to?

04:33.216 --> 04:34.416
I would say so.

04:34.484 --> 04:35.851
With the price Darken Rahl

04:35.919 --> 04:37.986
has on these
pretty little mugs of ours.

04:40.156 --> 04:42.725
Do it, Gwildor.

05:01.010 --> 05:03.812
Look on the bright side, Frytss.
You may have a big belly,

05:03.880 --> 05:06.815
but tonight you'll have plenty
to fill it with.

05:08.284 --> 05:10.085
And here's to the poor
unsuspecting town

05:10.153 --> 05:12.354
of Lothringham, next stop
on our little tour

05:12.422 --> 05:13.689
of the Midlands.

05:13.757 --> 05:16.492
Oh, here, sorry
about the wait, my lovelies.

05:16.559 --> 05:18.560
Lunatic asylum in here tonight,
as you can see.

05:18.628 --> 05:19.595
Hm, well...

05:19.662 --> 05:21.764
Oh, hands to yourself, swine.

05:21.831 --> 05:23.599
Yeah, that's right,

05:23.666 --> 05:25.768
cram it in before it walks away.

05:25.835 --> 05:27.970
You should talk,
you bloated bag of swill.

05:29.439 --> 05:31.774
Warms my heart to hear
you lovebirds coo.

05:31.841 --> 05:34.443
Lovebirds my posterior. If you
hadn't found that mirror

05:34.511 --> 05:36.412
and brought us
into the current business,

05:36.479 --> 05:38.881
that one would be a distant
memory of wasted youth by now.

05:38.948 --> 05:40.282
Soon enough, my dove.

05:40.350 --> 05:42.551
Just a few more bags
of gold salted away,

05:42.619 --> 05:44.953
and I will never again have
to look into your shining eyes

05:45.021 --> 05:47.055
and ask myself,
"What was I thinking?"

05:47.123 --> 05:48.957
Meant for each other,
aren't you?

05:49.025 --> 05:51.593
Like two fleas on a dog's pos--

05:51.661 --> 05:53.796
What?

05:55.865 --> 05:56.832
Hey, Seeker.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.634
Richard. Kahlan.

05:58.701 --> 06:00.903
I'm so glad to see
you both alive and well.

06:00.970 --> 06:02.571
What brings you back
here so soon?

06:02.639 --> 06:04.106
We parted ways with Zedd two
weeks ago.

06:04.174 --> 06:05.707
We're supposed to meet him here.

06:05.775 --> 06:07.576
Have you seen him?
- Not yet.

06:07.644 --> 06:09.912
But I'll give you a room while
you wait for him to turn up.

06:09.979 --> 06:11.447
Oh, thank you, Bianca,

06:11.514 --> 06:13.615
but it's too dangerous for you.

06:13.683 --> 06:16.618
Rahl's been killing people who
give us shelter.

06:16.686 --> 06:18.720
We'll camp in the woods,
and come by tomorrow.

06:18.788 --> 06:22.124
Could I at least give the Seeker
and the Confessor a hot meal?

06:22.192 --> 06:24.126
Oh. We've been
on the road so long

06:24.194 --> 06:26.495
I'm not sure we remember
exactly what that is.

06:26.563 --> 06:28.030
Heh. Come on.

06:31.067 --> 06:33.001
We'll steal horses.

06:33.069 --> 06:35.571
If we gallop all night we'll
cross the River Kern by dawn.

06:35.638 --> 06:37.773
No, no, no, no, no.

06:37.841 --> 06:40.742
Don't you see what
an opportunity this is?

06:40.810 --> 06:43.011
The Sword of Truth is among
the most valuable objects

06:43.079 --> 06:45.614
in the Midlands.
It could easily fetch us

06:45.682 --> 06:47.216
a hundred thousand
pieces of gold.

06:47.283 --> 06:49.251
Steal the Sword of Truth
from the Seeker?

06:49.319 --> 06:52.521
Sorry.
My skin's worth 100,001.

06:52.589 --> 06:54.022
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:54.090 --> 06:55.657
You have a buyer?

06:55.725 --> 06:57.593
They'd be trampling
each other for the honor

06:57.660 --> 07:00.362
of meeting my price.
But if you'd rather go back

07:00.430 --> 07:02.064
to fleecing children
out of their money

07:02.131 --> 07:04.266
or whatever it was you were
doing in the gutter

07:04.334 --> 07:05.934
I dragged you out of--

07:06.002 --> 07:07.636
I'll find somebody
who wants to be rich.

07:12.609 --> 07:15.010
If the Seeker catches us
stealing the Sword of Truth,

07:15.078 --> 07:16.445
he'll run us through with it.

07:16.513 --> 07:18.413
I'm telling you
this is a bad idea.

07:18.481 --> 07:21.049
That's what you said the time we
swindled the town of Norwich.

07:21.117 --> 07:23.051
And look at how fat
you got off that feat.

07:23.119 --> 07:25.254
The town of Norwich
hardly compares to the Seeker.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.222
For one thing, he didn't have
all these muscles.

07:27.290 --> 07:28.624
Well, you have them now,

07:28.691 --> 07:30.058
so I'd say
you're equally matched.

07:30.126 --> 07:31.693
Yes, but--

07:31.761 --> 07:33.395
How do you think he got
all these muscles,

07:33.463 --> 07:35.130
you wine-soaked hag?

07:35.198 --> 07:38.934
By hacking apart hundreds
of D'Harans. That's how.

07:39.002 --> 07:41.003
I may have the body
but I don't have the talent.

07:41.070 --> 07:43.205
Lucky for you, I have both.

07:43.273 --> 07:44.806
You're gonna fight him?

07:44.874 --> 07:47.142
No, you pigeon head.

07:47.210 --> 07:49.211
I am going to use the one tool

07:49.279 --> 07:51.547
that the Seeker
is defenseless against.

07:56.819 --> 07:58.353
<i>All filled up and ready to go.</i>

08:00.690 --> 08:02.958
We have time
for a quick swim.

08:07.130 --> 08:08.797
Uh, I thought
we were in a hurry.

08:08.865 --> 08:12.134
Well, that was before the sun
came out, and it got so hot.

08:21.778 --> 08:22.878
Come on.

08:24.981 --> 08:26.915
Mm, it's beautiful.

08:29.485 --> 08:30.819
What are you waiting for?

08:40.496 --> 08:41.797
Kahlan--

08:41.864 --> 08:43.732
Don't be so serious
all the time.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.602
It's just a swim.

09:02.952 --> 09:05.020
You're going
to be very sorry

09:05.088 --> 09:06.688
walking around
in those wet pants all day.

09:10.827 --> 09:12.194
This is a bad idea.

09:12.261 --> 09:15.130
You won't say that
once you're in the water.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.467
IGHS]

09:52.468 --> 09:54.403
We really should get going.

09:55.838 --> 09:57.039
Ah.

09:59.275 --> 10:01.343
This is a very bad idea.

10:01.411 --> 10:02.778
Oh!

10:02.845 --> 10:04.513
Oh.

10:09.252 --> 10:10.986
What if you lose control?

10:11.054 --> 10:13.855
Oh, I can control myself.

10:13.923 --> 10:15.357
The question is, can you?

10:19.262 --> 10:21.563
You know what, you're right.

10:21.631 --> 10:23.799
This is a very bad idea.

10:36.388 --> 10:38.389
I was coming to see
if you were all right.

10:38.457 --> 10:40.224
I thought you were filling
the water skins.

10:42.127 --> 10:44.462
I seem to have left
them behind at the lake.

10:44.529 --> 10:46.030
I'll go back and get them.

10:46.098 --> 10:48.632
All right.
Just hurry.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.435
Yeah. Okay.

11:09.688 --> 11:11.922
Kahlan, why did you do that?

11:11.990 --> 11:13.524
Do what?

11:19.097 --> 11:21.065
What is this?

11:21.133 --> 11:24.001
You take your clothes off,
you swim that close to me--

11:24.069 --> 11:25.903
Take my clothes off?

11:25.971 --> 11:27.304
What are you talking about?

11:27.372 --> 11:30.040
Your hair's dry.

11:30.108 --> 11:31.408
That wasn't you in the lake.

11:31.476 --> 11:33.344
Your hair's wet.

11:33.411 --> 11:35.746
That wasn't you in the forest.

11:38.016 --> 11:41.752
Someone has got some
very powerful magic.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.554
Someone very close by.

11:45.724 --> 11:47.358
Oh, no.
- What?

11:47.425 --> 11:48.826
I know my sword,
and this isn't it.

11:48.894 --> 11:50.461
Someone stole
the Sword of Truth?

11:50.529 --> 11:52.296
How did that happen?
- I was distracted.

11:52.364 --> 11:53.931
By a naked woman you went
swimming with.

11:53.999 --> 11:56.500
I thought it was you.

11:56.568 --> 11:58.035
They can't be far.

11:58.103 --> 12:00.571
I'll look for tracks
by the lake, you go up the path.

12:03.074 --> 12:04.942
Thank you for seeing me, captain.

12:05.010 --> 12:07.778
You have something to tell me,
tell it quickly.

12:07.846 --> 12:10.381
Is there still a reward being
offered for the capture

12:10.448 --> 12:12.550
of the Seeker
and the Confessor?

12:12.617 --> 12:14.318
You know where they are?

12:14.386 --> 12:17.188
Is the price still
a million pieces of gold?

12:19.391 --> 12:20.925
What reward could be greater

12:20.992 --> 12:22.860
than the glory
of Lord Rahl's gratitude?

12:26.298 --> 12:28.532
Yes, a million,

12:28.600 --> 12:31.035
to be shared
with the arresting officer.

12:31.102 --> 12:32.670
Of course.

12:32.737 --> 12:34.772
If you know where
they are, let's hear it.

12:34.839 --> 12:36.540
Perhaps we should discuss that

12:36.608 --> 12:38.342
someplace
a little more private.

12:38.410 --> 12:41.579
We wouldn't want some eager pair
of ears beating us to the glory.

12:44.549 --> 12:46.917
A hundred thousand
divided by three,

12:46.985 --> 12:48.852
leaves 10, carry the one--

12:48.920 --> 12:50.454
No, carry the three.

12:50.522 --> 12:52.556
Wait. Thirty goes into 90--

12:52.624 --> 12:54.325
Okay, let me just make
it easier for you.

12:54.392 --> 12:56.594
Just divide by two.

12:56.661 --> 12:58.729
But there's three of us.

12:58.797 --> 13:00.931
What have you got
in there, cheese?

13:00.999 --> 13:04.268
Why does Gwildor
deserve any of it?

13:04.336 --> 13:05.903
Haven't you noticed
that every time

13:05.971 --> 13:07.771
he gulls us
into one of his schemes,

13:07.839 --> 13:10.808
we're the ones who end
up risking our hides? If we run,

13:10.875 --> 13:13.911
we can get to the gold
in the cave before he does.

13:13.979 --> 13:15.946
Uh, but he has the mirror.

13:16.014 --> 13:17.781
But we have the Sword.

13:17.849 --> 13:20.851
With which we conk him
the minute he gets there.

13:20.919 --> 13:22.453
And then we split
up the treasure,

13:22.520 --> 13:23.854
and the money from the Sword,

13:23.922 --> 13:26.123
and never have to lay eyes
on each other ever again.

13:26.191 --> 13:28.158
Best part of all.

13:28.226 --> 13:29.660
Halt!

13:29.728 --> 13:31.562
I'll take the Sword, Seeker.

13:34.232 --> 13:35.933
I'm not the Seeker.

13:38.803 --> 13:39.870
Oh, take it.
It's all yours.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.742
Apparently the Seeker's
legendary courage is just that,

13:44.809 --> 13:47.811
a legend.
Darken Rahl will have no trouble

13:47.879 --> 13:50.581
breaking him
in the dungeons of his palace.

13:50.649 --> 13:53.384
Arrest them, and don't let
the Confessor touch you.

13:53.451 --> 13:54.885
But I'm not the Confessor.

13:54.953 --> 13:57.054
No.
This is just a disguise.

13:57.122 --> 13:59.290
It's a magical one.
When our friend gets here

13:59.357 --> 14:01.058
he'll change us back
to who we really are.

14:01.126 --> 14:02.893
We're thieves.
We cheat widows.

14:02.961 --> 14:04.695
We steal pennies out of blind
people's cups.

14:04.763 --> 14:05.896
Then we steal the cups.

14:05.964 --> 14:07.598
We stole the Treasure of Ixwood.

14:07.666 --> 14:09.233
We'll show you where it is.
- Silence!

14:09.301 --> 14:11.001
Gag them, and gag them well.

14:11.069 --> 14:13.404
If I hear one squeak,
it's your head.

14:25.550 --> 14:26.884
My love. Oh.

14:26.951 --> 14:28.552
Oh, I found you.

14:28.620 --> 14:32.089
Last night was the most
wonderful night of my life.

14:34.726 --> 14:38.095
I-- She--
I never saw her before.

14:38.163 --> 14:40.397
Did you find anybody?
No, but it looks like you did.

14:40.465 --> 14:42.733
Whoever you are,
I'm very sorry.

14:42.801 --> 14:44.501
You may have met
somebody who looks like me,

14:44.569 --> 14:45.769
but I'm not him.

14:45.837 --> 14:47.304
I know you don't want
the Confessor

14:47.372 --> 14:49.673
to think you've found another.
But she'll understand.

14:49.741 --> 14:51.342
Love is never something
you have to hide.

14:51.409 --> 14:53.110
I left a note for my husband.

14:53.178 --> 14:55.045
I told him I was running
away with you.

14:55.113 --> 14:56.947
There they are!

14:57.015 --> 15:00.384
I knew you'd lead us straight
to these lying thieves,

15:00.452 --> 15:01.685
you faithless wench.

15:03.488 --> 15:07.925
So the legend of the Seeker
was a lie all along.

15:07.992 --> 15:11.829
You use your reputation to prey
on peoples' trust and fear,

15:11.896 --> 15:13.831
Oh, no, no.
and then rob them blind.

15:13.898 --> 15:16.367
And it wasn't enough
to steal our treasure,

15:16.434 --> 15:17.835
you had to steal my wife?

15:17.902 --> 15:19.670
He didn't steal me.
We love each other.

15:19.738 --> 15:21.905
And the Seeker would never
steal our treasure.

15:21.973 --> 15:24.908
I-I'm sure he took
it somewhere to keep it safe.

15:24.976 --> 15:26.243
Aah!

15:26.311 --> 15:28.412
Well, if it's so safe,
you tell us where it is.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.214
We don't know where it is.

15:30.281 --> 15:32.883
Someone's using
some kind of magic

15:32.951 --> 15:34.551
to make them look
exactly like us.

15:34.619 --> 15:36.587
Sir, we don't want to fight you.

15:36.654 --> 15:38.188
We're after the same
people you are.

15:38.256 --> 15:39.556
If you help us find them--
Silence!

15:42.360 --> 15:45.729
Maybe once the Seeker is dead

15:45.797 --> 15:47.798
the Confessor
will be more cooperative.

15:50.869 --> 15:52.870
Run, my love. Run!

15:52.937 --> 15:55.506
Come on, get them!

16:07.685 --> 16:09.953
A third of a king's ransom
wasn't enough for you,

16:10.021 --> 16:11.422
no, you needed more.

16:11.489 --> 16:13.490
If you were the real Seeker,
you would have

16:13.558 --> 16:15.659
sacrificed yourself
and let the woman get away.

16:15.727 --> 16:17.995
When a real woman comes along,
I'll do just that.

16:19.731 --> 16:22.032
Oh.

16:27.439 --> 16:28.972
Come here.

16:33.378 --> 16:35.179
Just--
Just would you--

16:42.821 --> 16:45.155
You're not doing this because
I look like this, are you?

16:45.223 --> 16:46.990
If I cared about looks,

16:47.058 --> 16:49.293
do you think I would have
picked you to begin with?

16:51.863 --> 16:53.730
Ah, we'll get
out of this, Clayre.

16:53.798 --> 16:56.733
We've gotten out of worse. Like
the time we were doing

16:56.801 --> 16:58.569
the kidnapped sister
in Glensborough.

17:00.071 --> 17:03.340
And the Duke walked in while
I was changing my wig.

17:03.408 --> 17:05.209
And threw us into the dungeon
with that ogre.

17:05.276 --> 17:07.377
Who smelled like
rotting monkeys.

17:11.915 --> 17:13.217
Oh.

17:13.284 --> 17:14.852
None of which
would have happened

17:14.919 --> 17:16.553
if you hadn't taken
it upon yourself

17:16.621 --> 17:19.089
to deflower the Duke's daughter.

17:19.156 --> 17:20.590
Have you ever met a woman

17:20.657 --> 17:22.326
who you didn't think
would look better

17:22.393 --> 17:25.295
with her knickers
on the bedpost?

17:25.363 --> 17:26.730
Clayre.

17:26.798 --> 17:28.765
Don't even try.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.568
I'd have to be a few tomatoes
short of a salad

17:31.636 --> 17:33.770
to go down
that garden path again.

17:33.838 --> 17:35.205
I don't know about you,

17:35.273 --> 17:38.509
but I am getting
out of this dung heap.

17:38.576 --> 17:41.612
Hello? Anyone out there?

17:48.485 --> 17:49.886
We lost them.

17:51.989 --> 17:54.757
Except every citizen in Ixwood
is going to be looking for us.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.693
We need to give them
their treasure back,

17:56.760 --> 17:59.095
before the stories spread
of the Seeker being a thief

17:59.163 --> 18:01.397
and the Confessor
being his accomplice.

18:01.465 --> 18:05.034
Except we have no idea
which way the imposters went.

18:05.102 --> 18:06.669
Or if they even look like us.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.338
If ever there was
a time we needed Zedd.

18:10.207 --> 18:12.208
Maybe he's at the tavern
by now.

18:12.276 --> 18:14.010
Let's find out.

18:17.681 --> 18:20.950
I can't believe after fighting
legions of D'Harans,

18:21.018 --> 18:22.619
Mord-Sith and Rahl himself,

18:22.686 --> 18:25.622
I lose the Sword of Truth
to a couple of petty criminals.

18:25.689 --> 18:30.159
I mean, has the Seeker
ever lost the Sword before?

18:30.227 --> 18:31.594
Kahlan?

18:31.662 --> 18:33.396
Don't worry.

18:33.464 --> 18:35.398
We'll get it back.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.443
Drinks for everybody.

18:47.511 --> 18:50.680
I've captured the Seeker
and the Confessor.

18:50.748 --> 18:52.348
Uh, you heard the gentleman.

18:52.416 --> 18:54.784
Rum all around,
from the good bottle.

18:54.852 --> 18:57.453
A word with you
in private, barmaid?

18:57.521 --> 18:59.522
Of course.

19:07.765 --> 19:10.066
I know that you and your
gentleman friend Gwildor

19:10.134 --> 19:12.402
have been harboring
the Seeker and the Confessor.

19:12.469 --> 19:14.737
Lies. People will say
anything in this town.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.507
What I don't know
is where this Gwildor is.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.008
Well, that makes two of us.

19:19.076 --> 19:21.010
I haven't seen him in days.

19:21.078 --> 19:23.546
I have instruments
in my stockade.

19:23.614 --> 19:26.316
Very, very sharp ones,

19:26.383 --> 19:30.119
that could have you singing
quite a different song.

19:30.187 --> 19:33.356
Look, you can carve
me to bits,

19:33.424 --> 19:35.591
I still won't know where he is.

19:37.194 --> 19:40.530
Then there's only one way
you can save yourself.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.599
Get your hands off me.

19:45.102 --> 19:47.170
I belong to another.

19:47.237 --> 19:48.538
You know,

19:48.605 --> 19:51.541
it's not often a man
can be absolutely certain

19:51.608 --> 19:54.744
of the faithfulness
of his beloved.

20:06.890 --> 20:09.292
Oh, my God. You--

20:09.360 --> 20:12.628
You could kill a woman,
giving her a fright like that.

20:12.696 --> 20:14.530
What have you been up to?

20:14.598 --> 20:16.532
Changing into a D'Haran Captain

20:16.600 --> 20:18.501
and capturing the Seeker
and the Confessor.

20:18.569 --> 20:21.471
Or should I say,
two petty thieves

20:21.538 --> 20:23.706
who at the moment resemble them
most remarkably.

20:23.774 --> 20:27.610
Oh, poor, poor,
Frytss and Clayre.

20:29.179 --> 20:31.147
Oh, this wouldn't have
anything to do

20:31.215 --> 20:34.217
with collecting a rather
sizeable reward, now, would it?

20:34.284 --> 20:36.252
You brilliant woman,
how did you guess?

20:37.955 --> 20:40.556
I've sent word to Darken Rahl.

20:40.624 --> 20:42.859
Tomorrow morning a Mord-Sith
will take the Seeker

20:42.926 --> 20:44.794
and the Confessor
to his dungeons,

20:44.862 --> 20:47.497
little suspecting that she's
paying a million pieces of gold

20:47.564 --> 20:49.832
for a sorry pair of imposters.

20:49.900 --> 20:53.069
Oh, after which,
you and I will proceed

20:53.137 --> 20:55.204
to a certain cave in the forest.

20:55.272 --> 20:57.440
Where Frytss and Clayre
will not, alas,

20:57.508 --> 20:59.942
be on hand to collect their
share of the treasure.

21:00.010 --> 21:02.378
Leaving us to bear
that burden

21:02.446 --> 21:05.615
all by ourselves.

21:08.786 --> 21:11.087
Ah, tell me, where's
the D'Haran captain himself?

21:11.155 --> 21:13.022
Retired on his pension,
I believe.

21:13.090 --> 21:15.058
At the bottom of a well.

21:17.594 --> 21:19.395
I need you
to hold onto this.

21:19.463 --> 21:21.297
I don't want a Mord-Sith
anywhere near it.

21:21.365 --> 21:23.266
Wise, wise thinking, my love.

21:24.701 --> 21:28.104
Just one favor.

21:28.172 --> 21:30.239
Change back
into the captain first.

21:32.342 --> 21:33.810
I warn you,

21:33.877 --> 21:35.344
he's heavily armed.

21:35.412 --> 21:38.681
Oh, you know I like
a well-equipped soldier.

21:55.933 --> 21:57.200
Come on.

22:05.542 --> 22:07.577
Oh, sorry, we're closing.

22:07.644 --> 22:10.746
Seeker. Confessor.

22:12.850 --> 22:14.383
Richard. Kahlan.

22:14.451 --> 22:16.185
Thank the Spirits you're safe.

22:16.253 --> 22:17.520
Bianca, can we--?

22:17.588 --> 22:19.122
Of course.

22:22.693 --> 22:24.527
Have you seen Zedd?

22:24.595 --> 22:26.195
Not yet.

22:26.263 --> 22:28.197
What's going on?
And how did you escape?

22:29.867 --> 22:31.534
We were never caught.

22:31.602 --> 22:33.136
Someone's impersonating us.

22:33.203 --> 22:36.706
Who? And how is that
even possible?

22:36.773 --> 22:38.207
That's what we need
to find out.

22:38.275 --> 22:40.376
If people are saying
the Seeker and the Confessor

22:40.444 --> 22:42.345
have been captured,
then the D'Harans

22:42.412 --> 22:43.913
must have caught the imposters.

22:43.981 --> 22:46.282
The nearest D'Haran outpost
is three leagues here.

22:46.350 --> 22:49.185
We'll get them out.

22:49.253 --> 22:52.021
But don't you realize
what a chance this is?

22:52.089 --> 22:54.991
If Darken Rahl thinks
he already has you,

22:55.058 --> 22:56.592
then he won't be
looking for you.

22:56.660 --> 22:58.728
You should get as far away
from here as you can.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.564
No, no, the imposters stole
the treasure of Ixwood.

23:04.668 --> 23:05.801
And the Sword of Truth.

23:07.304 --> 23:09.872
I'm so frightened for you.

23:09.940 --> 23:12.842
Will you at least take
one precaution for me?

23:12.910 --> 23:14.443
What precaution?

23:14.511 --> 23:16.145
There was a D'Haran commander
in here,

23:16.213 --> 23:18.281
bragging that the Mord-Sith

23:18.348 --> 23:20.416
and her escort are coming
down the main road.

23:20.484 --> 23:22.318
Take the old goat path.

23:22.386 --> 23:23.853
Out the front,
left at the well.

23:23.921 --> 23:25.955
It's slower, but at least
you'll get there alive.

23:26.023 --> 23:27.657
Thanks.
Thank you for your help.

23:27.724 --> 23:29.058
No, thank you.

23:29.126 --> 23:31.093
And may the Spirits
be with you.

23:48.378 --> 23:50.880
Hyah!

23:50.948 --> 23:53.716
I hate to think how many towns
those charlatans have raided.

23:53.784 --> 23:55.218
Or how many corsets.

23:55.285 --> 23:56.552
Maybe Bianca is right.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.321
We have to get
the Sword of Truth back

23:58.388 --> 24:01.624
but why not let the D'Harans
hand the imposters over to Rahl?

24:01.692 --> 24:03.492
I mean, if he thinks
that he's captured

24:03.560 --> 24:05.795
the Seeker and Confessor he
would stop looking for us.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.997
Rahl's too smart
to be fooled by them.

24:08.065 --> 24:09.899
He'll realize their frauds.

24:09.967 --> 24:11.367
At least they'll be
in his dungeon,

24:11.435 --> 24:13.336
they won't be able to steal
from anyone else.

24:13.403 --> 24:16.339
Rahl's not going to let them
rot in his dungeon.

24:16.406 --> 24:19.008
He wanted you alive
so he could break you.

24:19.076 --> 24:20.876
Force you
to kneel before him

24:20.944 --> 24:23.145
as an example
to those that follow.

24:23.213 --> 24:24.914
Now he has that.

24:24.982 --> 24:27.250
He could force them to say
and do whatever he wanted.

24:29.553 --> 24:32.355
Make them swear their allegiance
to the House of Rahl.

24:32.422 --> 24:34.457
And the people of the Midlands
would believe it.

24:34.524 --> 24:36.492
As far as they would know
the Seeker and Confessor

24:36.560 --> 24:38.094
wouldn't be fighting for them.

24:38.161 --> 24:39.795
They'd be fighting for Rahl.

24:44.624 --> 24:45.490
You.

24:45.558 --> 24:47.592
There.

24:48.995 --> 24:50.028
Turnkey.

24:52.264 --> 24:54.899
Do they really expect
me to eat this slop?

24:57.503 --> 25:01.840
If you brought me some of those
luscious, juicy mutton chops

25:01.907 --> 25:04.409
I saw the officers eating,

25:04.477 --> 25:07.012
I could make you

25:07.079 --> 25:11.650
very glad that you did.

25:14.754 --> 25:16.655
What's the problem?

25:16.722 --> 25:18.657
Oh.

25:18.724 --> 25:20.859
Is it those stories you've heard

25:20.926 --> 25:22.827
about Confessors
and the terrible things

25:22.895 --> 25:24.763
that they can do to a man?

25:24.830 --> 25:28.033
That's all just made up to scare you.

25:28.100 --> 25:30.368
No, it isn't that.

25:35.808 --> 25:37.308
Hm?

25:43.949 --> 25:46.484
This one's yours, love crumpet.

25:49.989 --> 25:51.556
What?

25:51.624 --> 25:53.925
I know how excited you get
around leather and chains,

25:53.993 --> 25:55.660
but are Darken Rahl's
torture chambers

25:55.728 --> 25:56.995
really a better alternative?

26:19.418 --> 26:22.387
Captain, captain!

26:22.455 --> 26:24.456
The prisoners have escaped!

26:42.608 --> 26:44.843
What? Where are you going?

26:44.910 --> 26:46.211
As far away
from here as I can get.

26:46.278 --> 26:47.679
What?
- The idiots have escaped.

26:47.747 --> 26:49.247
When the Mord-Sith discovers

26:49.315 --> 26:51.149
I've let the Seeker
and the Confessor get away,

26:51.217 --> 26:53.017
I'll be fish food.

26:53.085 --> 26:54.419
Give me the mirror,

26:54.487 --> 26:56.087
change me back right now.
- No, no, no.

26:56.155 --> 26:59.124
Wait, wait, this-- This might
actually play into our hands.

26:59.191 --> 27:00.525
How?

27:00.593 --> 27:02.193
Darling, I was coming
here to tell you

27:02.261 --> 27:04.596
that Richard and Kahlan
are on their way here,

27:04.663 --> 27:06.631
now to free Frytss and Clayre.

27:06.699 --> 27:10.335
You grab them when
they get here then...

27:10.402 --> 27:12.670
And the Mord-Sith arrives,
I deliver the real thing.

27:12.738 --> 27:14.038
Yeah.

27:14.106 --> 27:15.640
But what about
the gold in the cave?

27:15.708 --> 27:17.675
Frytss and Clayre
must be halfway there by now.

27:17.743 --> 27:20.879
You're a D'Haran captain.
Send a quad after them.

27:20.946 --> 27:22.480
With orders to kill.

27:22.548 --> 27:24.082
There's my boy.

27:24.150 --> 27:26.551
Go back to the tavern,
pack your things.

27:26.619 --> 27:28.119
I'll come for you tonight.

27:28.187 --> 27:29.954
A million gold pieces richer.

27:34.994 --> 27:38.563
When Gwildor gets here we hide
behind the rock, knock him out,

27:38.631 --> 27:40.298
grab the amulet and run.

27:40.366 --> 27:42.867
What if he's ready for that?
What if he knocks us out?

27:42.935 --> 27:44.636
I say we take off right now.

27:44.703 --> 27:46.037
You can do what you like.

27:46.105 --> 27:47.672
I'm not running
around the countryside

27:47.740 --> 27:48.840
with this bull's-eye on.

27:48.908 --> 27:50.708
Fine, Gwildor's all yours.

27:50.776 --> 27:53.511
You're not scared of Gwildor.

27:53.579 --> 27:55.980
You're just not ready to give
up those rippling muscles.

27:56.048 --> 27:58.149
A story to tell with pride, boys:

27:58.217 --> 28:01.619
The day you saw the Seeker
and the Confessor die in agony.

28:04.757 --> 28:06.157
You want a story
to tell with pride?

28:07.793 --> 28:09.861
Promise you'll let us
go on our way,

28:09.929 --> 28:12.163
and the Seeker here
will be more than happy

28:12.231 --> 28:13.965
to finish what I was
so rude to interrupt.

28:15.367 --> 28:17.435
What?

28:19.004 --> 28:21.005
Show no mercy.

28:30.649 --> 28:33.218
Richard. Kahlan.

28:33.285 --> 28:35.620
Thank all the Spirits
in creation I found you in time.

28:35.688 --> 28:38.223
Yes, thank them indeed.

28:38.290 --> 28:39.991
I was on my way
to the tavern to meet you,

28:40.059 --> 28:41.759
but the town was all
abuzz with the news

28:41.827 --> 28:43.795
that the Seeker
had been captured,

28:43.863 --> 28:46.097
so I followed
these D'Harans and--

28:46.165 --> 28:48.132
What's all this?

28:48.200 --> 28:51.336
Well, we're
just keeping it safe.

28:51.403 --> 28:53.671
For the good people
of Ixwood.

28:53.739 --> 28:57.041
The nasty D'Harans were about
to seize every bit of it.

28:57.109 --> 28:58.743
Well, we'll have to take
it straight back

28:58.811 --> 29:00.278
to the good people of Ixwood

29:00.346 --> 29:02.780
and be on our way
before the nasty D'Harans

29:02.848 --> 29:04.649
seize every bit of us.

29:04.717 --> 29:07.685
Absolutely. Instantly.

29:07.753 --> 29:10.388
But there's no reason to drag
yourself all the way to Ixwood.

29:10.456 --> 29:12.223
We'll just trot
the gold right over there,

29:12.291 --> 29:14.092
and meet you
at the crossroads.

29:14.159 --> 29:16.261
Meet me at the crossroads.

29:16.328 --> 29:18.963
Good plan.

29:19.031 --> 29:20.665
Like we did that time in,
oh, where was it,

29:20.733 --> 29:22.100
Massenthal.

29:22.167 --> 29:23.301
Massenthal.

29:23.369 --> 29:24.769
Yeah.

29:24.837 --> 29:26.137
That's right.

29:26.205 --> 29:28.673
Seeing as the town of Massenthal
was brought into being

29:28.741 --> 29:30.108
three seconds ago,

29:30.175 --> 29:33.044
I'll make sure the gold
gets back to Ixwood.

29:33.112 --> 29:35.280
And you'll tell me who you are

29:35.347 --> 29:37.282
and what you've done
with my friends.

29:46.692 --> 29:50.228
It's not well-guarded.
That's lucky.

29:50.296 --> 29:52.196
You know what Zedd says:
"A man who trusts in luck

29:52.264 --> 29:53.698
better have plenty of it."

30:33.038 --> 30:35.907
I suggest you save a little
fight for the Mord-Sith.

30:39.704 --> 30:41.672
And how does this amulet work?

30:41.740 --> 30:43.607
Well, if I can get somebody
to look into it,

30:43.675 --> 30:45.175
their reflection stays inside.

30:45.243 --> 30:46.977
Yeah, and then if I get
you to look into it--

30:47.045 --> 30:49.813
I can turn you into them.
- Montressor's Mirror.

30:49.881 --> 30:52.283
Created by a sorcerer who wanted
to capture the image

30:52.350 --> 30:53.717
of his beloved dying wife

30:53.785 --> 30:55.920
and then have her
with him always.

30:55.987 --> 30:57.621
It's been lost for centuries.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.223
Well, Gwildor found it.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.824
The way I heard it,
he won it at cards.

31:00.892 --> 31:02.159
Yeah,
this is Gwildor's fault.

31:02.227 --> 31:03.427
He pulled us into this.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.762
I only went along with it

31:04.829 --> 31:06.297
because pork-brains
here swore

31:06.364 --> 31:08.799
that we were gonna be aiding
the true Seeker in his quest.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.969
Gwildor's her friend,
not mine.

31:12.037 --> 31:15.239
And for a few tots of rum,
she could be your friend too.

31:17.542 --> 31:20.911
How did this Gwildor
manage to capture

31:20.979 --> 31:23.213
the real Richard and Kahlan's
reflections?

31:23.281 --> 31:25.115
When they came through
a few weeks ago

31:25.183 --> 31:26.583
Gwildor's lady friend
tricked them

31:26.651 --> 31:27.952
into looking into the mirror.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.720
She just gave them a shave
and a bath.

31:29.788 --> 31:31.322
She's a tavern keeper,
her name's--

31:31.389 --> 31:33.090
Bianca.

31:33.158 --> 31:36.060
And we thought
she was a friend.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.730
If she's not your friend
anymore,

31:39.798 --> 31:41.732
that means she's your enemy,

31:41.800 --> 31:43.300
and seeing as she's
our enemy too,

31:43.368 --> 31:45.836
that makes us
all friends, right?

31:48.673 --> 31:50.741
In the broadest possible sense.

31:52.177 --> 31:53.711
Well, then, friend,

31:53.778 --> 31:55.713
we're glad we could help you,

31:55.780 --> 31:57.848
and we'll just, uh,
be on our way then.

32:00.485 --> 32:01.552
Not so fast.

32:06.858 --> 32:10.494
The curtain has not yet fallen
on your performance.

32:17.535 --> 32:18.969
Oh. Zedd. Heh.

32:19.037 --> 32:20.871
Going somewhere?

32:20.939 --> 32:23.007
Why, you shouldn't
sneak in like that,

32:23.074 --> 32:24.875
you could scare
a person to death.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.478
Richard and Kahlan have been
looking for you.

32:27.545 --> 32:30.647
Thank the Spirits,
we found each other.

32:30.715 --> 32:33.584
I've just freed
them from the D'Harans.

32:33.651 --> 32:34.985
Freed them.

32:35.053 --> 32:36.887
That's wonderful.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.456
Don't even try, Bianca.

32:39.524 --> 32:42.259
Did you think you could fool
a Wizard of the First Order?

32:42.327 --> 32:44.461
I want the magic mirror,

32:44.529 --> 32:46.330
so when I find
the imposters you created

32:46.398 --> 32:49.099
I can change them back
to their sorry selves

32:49.167 --> 32:50.567
before they heap
even more infamy

32:50.635 --> 32:52.403
on the Seeker's good name.

32:52.470 --> 32:55.873
If you give me the tiniest clue
as to what you're talking about,

32:55.940 --> 32:57.674
perhaps I can help you.

32:57.742 --> 33:01.612
Would a touch
of the Confessor's hand

33:01.679 --> 33:03.280
be clue enough?

33:03.348 --> 33:05.315
W-Well, how do I know
she's not an imposter?

33:05.383 --> 33:06.817
H-how do you know--?

33:06.885 --> 33:08.352
There's only one way
to find out.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.988
Are you willing to risk it?

33:11.056 --> 33:14.158
I'd love to have you
as my willing slave, Bianca.

33:14.225 --> 33:16.593
All the things
I'd have you do for me.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.395
No, take it. Take it,
take it, take it!

33:20.698 --> 33:22.900
And may it bring you less
trouble than it's brought me.

33:22.967 --> 33:24.735
Where's Gwildor?

33:24.803 --> 33:26.570
He's at the D'Haran camp,

33:26.638 --> 33:28.906
posing as a captain
of the guards.

33:28.973 --> 33:30.941
And what about Richard
and Kahlan? Where are they?

33:34.746 --> 33:37.448
You mean, they're not--?
- Hello, Bianca.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.717
You're looking well for someone
who just stabbed a knife

33:40.785 --> 33:42.653
in the back
of every friend she has.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.688
Yeah.

33:44.756 --> 33:48.459
Where are the real Seeker
and Confessor?

33:49.894 --> 33:51.562
They've probably f-fallen
into the trap

33:51.629 --> 33:53.397
that Gwildor set for them.

33:53.465 --> 33:54.998
The Mord-Sith
may already have come

33:55.066 --> 33:56.433
to take them to Darken Rahl.

33:56.501 --> 33:57.601
Please, please, let me go.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.169
That's all I know.

33:59.237 --> 34:01.305
That's all the help
I can give you.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.373
Oh, no, Bianca.

34:03.441 --> 34:06.810
I feel certain you have much,
much more to give.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.121
The gold?

34:17.188 --> 34:20.090
Lord Rahl insists
upon delivery of the captives

34:20.158 --> 34:23.827
to the People's Palace
before the reward is paid.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.130
He's been disappointed
too many times.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.065
If you want the gold,

34:28.132 --> 34:29.399
you'll have to come with us.

34:30.802 --> 34:32.168
It will be my honor

34:32.237 --> 34:35.772
to personally present
the captives to Lord Rahl.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.908
His gratitude
would be even greater

34:37.976 --> 34:39.376
if you delivered
the Wizard as well.

34:40.879 --> 34:43.313
And where might the Wizard be,

34:43.380 --> 34:45.248
Seeker?

34:48.820 --> 34:50.420
Hm.

35:01.866 --> 35:02.833
Wait!

35:02.901 --> 35:04.501
You have been fooled, mistress.

35:06.037 --> 35:08.805
These are the real
Seeker and Confessor.

35:08.873 --> 35:11.508
The ones you've
got there are imposters.

35:11.576 --> 35:13.477
And so is he.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.779
He's nothing but a common thief,

35:15.847 --> 35:17.881
disguising
himself with magic,

35:17.949 --> 35:19.716
and I can prove it.

35:19.784 --> 35:20.951
No!

35:21.019 --> 35:22.519
No.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.354
No!

35:28.927 --> 35:30.093
How could you betray me?

35:33.831 --> 35:35.299
Now to unmask his accomplices.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.002
I don't know who you are,

35:39.070 --> 35:40.904
I don't know what kind
of magic you have,

35:40.972 --> 35:43.807
and I don't know who's
real and who is not,

35:43.875 --> 35:47.211
so I'm gonna take you
all to Darken Rahl

35:47.278 --> 35:49.179
and let him sort it out.

35:49.247 --> 35:51.148
He's rather good at that.

35:53.718 --> 35:54.952
Take them.

36:17.094 --> 36:18.928
Death isn't good enough for you.

36:18.996 --> 36:20.696
Having your head
crushed between stones

36:20.764 --> 36:22.665
while rats gnaw your feet
to the ankles

36:22.733 --> 36:24.700
is barely good enough for you.

36:31.108 --> 36:33.709
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander.

36:33.777 --> 36:36.479
What did I do to deserve
such good fortune?

36:39.716 --> 36:41.584
He's setting a trap for you.

36:41.652 --> 36:45.721
Of course he is. Some feeble
attempt to rescue his friends.

36:45.789 --> 36:48.691
Which is why I'm going
to walk into the trap alone.

36:48.759 --> 36:50.526
The one person in the world

36:50.594 --> 36:55.031
a Wizard can't use his powers
against is a Mord-Sith.

37:09.980 --> 37:12.214
Zedd?

37:12.282 --> 37:14.617
In a manner of speaking.

37:20.157 --> 37:22.358
What about me?
- Shh.

37:43.614 --> 37:44.880
Run!

37:54.825 --> 37:57.460
Gwildor!

37:57.527 --> 37:59.795
Gwildor!

37:59.863 --> 38:01.464
Catch them.

38:01.531 --> 38:03.399
I'm sorry, mistress.
There are so many of them.

38:03.467 --> 38:05.968
Unh. And I can't run.

38:06.036 --> 38:07.470
But at least
you have the Wizard.

38:07.537 --> 38:10.373
Cold comfort, when the prize
was the Seeker,

38:10.440 --> 38:12.074
but better than
no comfort at all.

38:12.142 --> 38:13.943
I'm not the Wizard,

38:14.011 --> 38:16.345
I'm Bianca, the tavern keeper.

38:16.413 --> 38:18.514
The Wizard bewitched me
and tied me up

38:18.582 --> 38:20.549
to lure you away
from the prisoners.

38:20.617 --> 38:24.453
Oh, Gwildor, it's me.

38:24.521 --> 38:26.656
Tell it to Lord Rahl.

38:41.471 --> 38:43.172
Are you all right?

38:45.108 --> 38:48.077
You're not Kahlan.

38:48.145 --> 38:50.079
Hey, there's nobody
around, Seeker.

38:50.147 --> 38:52.314
Your dream could come true,

38:52.382 --> 38:54.116
with no price to pay.

38:54.184 --> 38:55.651
Why would you wanna do that?

38:55.719 --> 38:57.887
Story to tell my grandchildren?

38:57.954 --> 39:00.656
Who knows, they might be
your grandchildren.

39:00.724 --> 39:02.825
Don't you find me desirable?

39:05.996 --> 39:07.163
Yes.

39:07.230 --> 39:10.633
Which is why you'd better stop.

39:12.469 --> 39:16.505
You may be the one true Seeker,
but you're not very much fun.

39:19.810 --> 39:21.210
Ever the fast worker,
aren't you?

39:23.080 --> 39:25.047
How anyone gets
around with these

39:25.115 --> 39:27.850
things on them
is entirely beyond me.

39:34.057 --> 39:35.658
Zedd.

39:47.971 --> 39:50.206
Well, thank you for everything.

39:51.541 --> 39:53.375
We won't take any more
of your time.

39:53.443 --> 39:55.611
Bye-bye!
- Leave them.

39:55.679 --> 39:57.179
We're just gonna
let them get away?

39:57.247 --> 40:00.750
We don't have time to take them
to the nearest constable.

40:00.817 --> 40:02.384
And they don't have this.

40:04.254 --> 40:06.489
That's gonna be a very useful
thing to have around.

40:06.556 --> 40:08.424
I'm not so sure about that.

40:08.492 --> 40:10.326
Sometimes
I think there's entirely

40:10.393 --> 40:11.794
too much magic in the world.

40:19.169 --> 40:21.337
Well, drop me a note,

40:21.404 --> 40:23.139
if you ever learn
how to write your name.

40:23.206 --> 40:26.442
I'll address it care of any
tavern, any place, any time.

40:26.510 --> 40:27.743
To think when I met you

40:27.811 --> 40:29.779
I had a few pieces
of gold in my pocket

40:29.846 --> 40:31.147
and a shred of dignity.

40:31.214 --> 40:32.715
For the rest of my life,
on this day,

40:32.783 --> 40:34.350
I will
celebrate the anniversary

40:34.417 --> 40:37.253
of seeing your face
for the very last time ever.

40:47.631 --> 40:48.831
Silver spurs.

40:48.899 --> 40:50.299
Gold bridle.

40:50.367 --> 40:52.334
The Winterhaven Double-Cross,
wouldn't you say?

40:52.402 --> 40:53.836
With the Trollsbridge variation.

40:55.172 --> 40:57.006
Please. Please, kind sir!

40:57.073 --> 40:58.607
My wife has fallen ill.

41:03.780 --> 41:06.115
Maybe we should have come
along a little later.

41:06.183 --> 41:08.250
Given you and Clayre
some time together.

41:08.318 --> 41:10.519
I'm not interested in her.

41:10.587 --> 41:13.722
Don't you think she's pretty?

41:13.790 --> 41:16.458
Why do I get the feeling there's
nothing I can say right now

41:16.526 --> 41:18.527
that isn't going
to get me in trouble?

41:18.595 --> 41:21.463
You're growing in wisdom
every day, my boy.

41:25.735 --> 41:27.803
Don't despair, my darling.

41:27.871 --> 41:29.772
I love you.

41:29.840 --> 41:32.107
At least we'll
always have each other.

41:32.175 --> 41:34.977
Gwildor, it's me.

41:35.045 --> 41:36.512
Gwildor...
