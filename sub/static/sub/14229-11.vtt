Elena, Navidad is not
for two days.

01:29.460 --> 01:32.040
Then happy almost
Navidad, cousin.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.210
Mm, buñuelos.

01:34.210 --> 01:35.580
One at
a time, Isa.

01:35.580 --> 01:39.500
Princess Elena,
the guests have arrived.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.580
Cristina!

01:40.580 --> 01:42.420
Isabel!

01:42.420 --> 01:43.670
I made you this garland.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.750
Thank you. I made
something for you, too.

01:48.540 --> 01:50.330
Go ahead.
Open it.

01:50.330 --> 01:52.790
It goes on
your wheelchair,

01:52.790 --> 01:53.960
like this.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.580
Oh, Isa, I love it!

01:56.580 --> 01:58.380
I was thinking
we could use it.

01:58.380 --> 01:59.960
to make
the castle piñata.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.540
It's a family
tradition.

02:01.540 --> 02:02.670
Okay.

02:05.380 --> 02:07.420
Princess Elena,
it is so kind of you

02:07.420 --> 02:09.330
to have us over again.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.420
Isabel's been excited
all week.

02:11.420 --> 02:12.790
Can I get you anything?

02:12.790 --> 02:15.250
Actually, I have
something for you.

02:15.250 --> 02:16.580
Our village would
be honored

02:16.580 --> 02:18.710
if you and your family
celebrated

02:18.710 --> 02:20.210
Nochebuena
with us tomorrow.

02:20.210 --> 02:21.420
Oh!

02:21.420 --> 02:23.830
Can we go, Elena?
Please!

02:23.830 --> 02:25.460
It is a kind offer,

02:25.460 --> 02:27.000
but we always spend
the night before Navidad

02:27.000 --> 02:28.380
in the palace.

02:28.380 --> 02:30.670
That doesn't mean
we couldn't do

02:30.670 --> 02:32.000
something different
this year, right?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.920
I don't know...

02:33.920 --> 02:37.620
Why we wouldn't say
yes to such a lovely
invitation, Francisco.

02:37.620 --> 02:38.830
So we can go?

02:38.830 --> 02:40.750
Um, Princess Elena.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.790
You have a few
other visitors.

02:42.790 --> 02:44.620
Uh, more than a few.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.170
Naomi?

02:47.170 --> 02:49.380
Merry Christmas, Elena.

02:49.380 --> 02:53.380
Mateo, Rafa, Carmen,
Julio, Doña Paloma?

02:53.380 --> 02:54.790
What are you all
doing here?

02:54.790 --> 02:57.750
On behalf of
Avalor City,

02:57.750 --> 03:01.710
I have come to invite
you to our Navidad party
tomorrow night.

03:01.710 --> 03:03.080
That's why we're
here, too.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.580
We're having a festival
at the harbor.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.210
The boats will be
all lit up.

03:06.210 --> 03:08.670
Or you could come to
our nochebuena celebration

03:08.670 --> 03:10.460
in the old square.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.000
It is very traditional.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.170
We sing
all the old songs.

03:13.170 --> 03:16.170
That's a lot of
invitations.

03:16.170 --> 03:19.670
But we're going to
Cristina's village, right?

03:19.670 --> 03:21.580
Before you decide,
Your Majesty,

03:21.580 --> 03:23.620
please let us tell you

03:23.620 --> 03:25.460

you say, Elena?

04:24.540 --> 04:26.330
Both of your parties
sound like fun.

04:26.330 --> 04:28.790
They sound like
lovely little fiestas,

04:28.790 --> 04:32.420

05:58.000 --> 06:00.330
So which celebration
will you attend, Your Majesty?

06:00.330 --> 06:02.000
I'm, uh...

06:02.000 --> 06:04.380
going to need a few minutes
to think it over.

06:04.380 --> 06:07.080
Maybe we can go to
all the celebrations.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.790
You know, spend a little
time in each place.

06:09.790 --> 06:11.620
I wish we could, mi hija,

06:11.620 --> 06:14.880
but there isn't enough time
to go to every one.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.790
And it is our family
tradition to spend

06:16.790 --> 06:19.290
the night before Navidad
in the palace.

06:19.290 --> 06:21.620
It is what we have
always done.

06:21.620 --> 06:23.790
But Cristina
is my best friend.

06:23.790 --> 06:26.080
If I only got one gift
for Navidad,

06:26.080 --> 06:28.210
it would be
to spend it with her.

06:28.210 --> 06:30.710
Um, Princess Elena,
they have asked

06:30.710 --> 06:31.620
if you have
come to a decision yet.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.580
No.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.040
Huh.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.040
Looks like a party
down there.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.000
Maybe we can have them

06:39.000 --> 06:40.750
all come back to
the palace tomorrow night

06:40.750 --> 06:42.580
and celebrate together.

06:42.580 --> 06:45.580
- How thoughtful.
- And impossible.

06:45.580 --> 06:48.250
The palace is not big enough
to throw a party for
the entire city.

06:48.250 --> 06:49.620
It doesn't
have to be here.

06:49.620 --> 06:51.620
It can be someplace
with more room.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.460
- Like the park.
- Yes, the park!

06:53.460 --> 06:55.000
That's perfect.
Come on, Isa.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.500
Let's go tell them
the good news.

06:58.540 --> 07:02.210
So I've decided to accept
all your invitations.

07:03.710 --> 07:05.710
And how is that
going to work?

07:05.710 --> 07:07.670
We're all going
to celebrate together in...

07:09.580 --> 07:10.880
Castillo Park!

07:10.880 --> 07:12.460
Isn't that great?

07:12.460 --> 07:15.790
Hmm. I think
it's a splendid idea.

07:15.790 --> 07:20.170
We will finally get
to share our Navidad
traditions with one another.

07:20.170 --> 07:21.790
Well done, princess.

07:21.790 --> 07:23.670
Well done.

07:23.670 --> 07:25.460
Oh, thank you,
Doña Paloma.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.420
No, thank you.

07:27.420 --> 07:29.620
What are we all
waiting for?

07:29.620 --> 07:31.620
We have a Navidad fiesta
to prepare for.

07:31.620 --> 07:35.080
And if any of you need
any last-minute decorations,

07:35.080 --> 07:37.420
my emporium
at the villa mercado

07:37.420 --> 07:41.380
is open late tonight
and early tomorrow.

07:41.380 --> 07:43.250
We're going to have
so much fun.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.790
We're going to make
so much money.

07:54.250 --> 07:57.420
Carmen, I have an early
Navidad gift for you.

07:57.420 --> 07:59.040
A new skillet!

07:59.040 --> 08:00.790
Thank you, Julio.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.380
According to
my calculations,

08:02.380 --> 08:04.750
it will take
approximately...

08:04.750 --> 08:07.460
twenty-one good whacks
to break open this piñata.

08:07.460 --> 08:09.620
Mmm, I say 24.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.580
Hi, girls.
Need any help?

08:13.040 --> 08:14.670
ELENA: Wow!

08:16.080 --> 08:17.670
A boat?!

08:18.830 --> 08:20.620
They brought
a boat?!

08:20.620 --> 08:22.620
Check out that boat, Mama.

08:22.620 --> 08:25.960
Everyone celebrates
in their own way, I suppose.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.290
Shall we practice?

08:27.290 --> 08:28.580
Sure. Marlena.

08:28.580 --> 08:29.880
From the top.

08:45.040 --> 08:50.960
♪ Hacia belén va
una burra rin rin... ♪

08:50.960 --> 08:52.790
Ah, that's it.

08:52.790 --> 08:54.920
Get it nice and hot.
Ow!

08:54.920 --> 08:57.120
Carmen, the smoke.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.120
Dad, we have to move
the boat.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.920
FERNANDO: Your boat is scaring
our goats.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.620
Oh, no. The goats are
trampling our flowers.

09:07.620 --> 09:08.920
Now stop!

09:08.920 --> 09:10.540
Shoo, shoo!

09:10.540 --> 09:12.670
Uh-oh. I'll be right back.

09:12.670 --> 09:15.000
Princess Elena,
thank goodness you are here.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.620
We have to get rid
of these goats.

09:16.620 --> 09:18.710
I think it's part of
the villagers' tradition.

09:18.710 --> 09:20.540
I'll just bring them
back over there.

09:20.540 --> 09:21.920
I'll help you.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.620
Come on, goats.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.460
Please.

09:28.580 --> 09:30.580
Where did all
our customers go?

09:30.580 --> 09:32.880
I don't know, Doña.
To the park?

09:32.880 --> 09:35.580
Already? We should've
sold more decorations.

09:35.580 --> 09:37.580
We've done pretty well.

09:37.580 --> 09:39.580
Pretty well
isn't good enough.

09:39.580 --> 09:43.080
Hmm. Looks like
I'll have to drum up
some more business.

09:44.620 --> 09:46.380
( singing in Spanish
continues loudly )

09:46.380 --> 09:48.460
Can you get them
to play softer?

09:48.460 --> 09:49.620
Um... what was that?

09:52.080 --> 09:53.880
All right.
Ha ha!

09:53.880 --> 09:55.790
The fireworks
are good to go.

09:55.790 --> 09:58.330
- The fireworks
have to go.
- And the goats.

09:58.330 --> 10:00.710
- And their boat.
- And their grill.

10:00.710 --> 10:04.170
I am sorry, princess,
but this isn't going to work.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.420
Perhaps we should all
go back to our neighborhoods.

10:06.420 --> 10:07.790
No, I don't wanna go.

10:07.790 --> 10:10.250
Wait. Let's not
give up just yet.

10:10.250 --> 10:12.040
I'm sure we can
figure this out.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.750
How?

10:13.750 --> 10:15.330
- A parade.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.250
We should have
a parade.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.330
You can all have
your own floats,

10:19.330 --> 10:21.670
and no one will get
in each others' way.

10:21.670 --> 10:23.750
Plus, we'll spread
holiday joy

10:23.750 --> 10:25.620
across the entire city.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.670
That's an excellent idea,
Doña.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.460
Yes, I know.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.880
And my emporium has
everything you need

10:31.880 --> 10:34.880
to build the perfect float,
on sale, today only.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.170
So what do you all think?

10:36.170 --> 10:37.880
- I love parades.
- Me, too.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.710
I can't think of
a better way

10:39.710 --> 10:41.790
to show off
your Navidad traditions

10:41.790 --> 10:43.790
for everyone to see.

10:43.790 --> 10:45.210
She makes a good point.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.790
- Yeah, sounds like fun.
- We can hand out tamales.

10:47.790 --> 10:50.170
- We can play our songs.
- With no goats.

10:50.170 --> 10:52.620
All right then.
Let's have a parade.

10:52.620 --> 10:54.420
After you stop by
my store

10:54.420 --> 10:57.580
for the best
Navi-deals in town.

10:57.580 --> 11:00.210
Princess Elena, if we go
all the way to our village

11:00.210 --> 11:03.250
to build a float,
we won't get back in time.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.420
So we can't ride
in the parade?

11:05.420 --> 11:07.750
Tell you what.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.670
Isabel and I
are gonna help you
build the float.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.750
I'm sure we have
everything we need
up at the palace.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.750
- Great.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.000
- Let's go design it.
- Okay.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.750
- Thank you,
Your Highness.
- It's my pleasure.

11:19.750 --> 11:22.040
Huh. Your parade idea worked.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.920
We made more money today
than in the last three months.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.420
Why stop there?

11:26.420 --> 11:29.420
Let's make more than
we have all year.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.380
I love what you've done
with your float, Rafa.

11:34.380 --> 11:35.710
Thank you, Doña.

11:35.710 --> 11:37.920
Between you and me,

11:37.920 --> 11:40.380
I think your Navidad
tradition is the best
of them all.

11:40.380 --> 11:45.120
But you need more flowers
to make it really eye-catching.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.920
And with more candles,

11:46.920 --> 11:48.960
you will literally
outshine the others.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.620
Princess Elena might even
have you lead the parade.

11:51.620 --> 11:54.750
I didn't know she was choosing
a float to lead the parade.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.120
Neither does she.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.790
I mean, how else will we decide
who goes first?

11:59.790 --> 12:02.500
- Perhaps Doña is right.
- Yeah.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.790
What's wrong
with our float?

12:05.790 --> 12:07.790
Nothing.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.250
But there could be
so much more right with it.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.580
You can't have a boat
without water,

12:11.580 --> 12:14.250
so why not add a fountain
right over there?

12:14.250 --> 12:16.000
My shop has
a huge selection.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.420
A fountain?

12:17.420 --> 12:18.750
Seems like a bit much.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.710
Not if you wanna show
the others

12:20.710 --> 12:22.920
who has the best
Navidad tradition.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.670
And Elena's gonna choose
the best float

12:25.670 --> 12:26.710
to lead the parade.

12:26.710 --> 12:30.170
!
- Unbelievable.

12:30.170 --> 12:32.620
And at the same time,
extremely impressive.

12:32.620 --> 12:34.500
They must really want
Princess Elena

12:34.500 --> 12:37.000
to think their way
of celebrating is the best.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
But our way
is the best.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.580
Is it, because I barely see
any decorations on this float.

12:43.580 --> 12:47.380
And are those
all the fireworks you have?

12:47.380 --> 12:51.330
Carmen, we have to get
more fireworks, more flowers,

12:51.330 --> 12:52.880
and more everything.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.880
And... there.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.540
It's beautiful.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.670
- Elena.
- Oh, good.

13:04.670 --> 13:06.170
You're just in time.

13:06.170 --> 13:07.710
The parade is about
to start.

13:07.710 --> 13:09.500
What parade?

13:11.580 --> 13:15.040
Wow, Mateo,
your float is so...

13:15.040 --> 13:16.670
bright.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.460
Thanks.

13:18.460 --> 13:19.750
Surely our float
should lead the parade,

13:19.750 --> 13:21.380
Don't you think,
Your Majesty?

13:21.380 --> 13:23.580
Uh, I guess that's fine.

13:23.580 --> 13:25.670
I hadn't really
thought about it.

13:26.710 --> 13:28.750
Elena, check out
our float.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.170
It's totally better
than theirs.

13:30.170 --> 13:31.750
We should lead
the parade.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.960
Okay... but does it
really matter

13:33.960 --> 13:36.380
who leads the parade?

13:36.380 --> 13:39.000
Who wants
fresh tamales?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.830
Courtesy of the best float
in Avalor.

13:42.830 --> 13:45.120
It's a bit too much,
if you ask me.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.750
Our float is the finest.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.460
I beg to differ.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.330
Hold on.
It's not a competition.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.580
I agree. The old ways
are clearly the best,

13:53.580 --> 13:55.290
so we should
lead the parade.

14:01.210 --> 14:04.500
No, not the trees!

14:04.500 --> 14:06.710
- Look out!
- Ay!

14:10.670 --> 14:12.250
- RAFA: Fire!

14:13.580 --> 14:14.670
We have to put it out.

14:15.830 --> 14:17.750
I'm gonna need
your fountain.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.670
The fireworks!
Run!

14:39.790 --> 14:41.460
Look out!

14:46.920 --> 14:48.750
The piñata.

14:51.580 --> 14:53.620
This was a mistake.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.580
Let's go
home, Mateo.

14:55.580 --> 14:57.040
Sorry, Elena.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.580
But there must be
something else we can do.

14:59.580 --> 15:01.790
It was nice of you
to try, princess,

15:01.790 --> 15:04.420
but I think it is
better this way.

15:04.420 --> 15:07.250
You're still welcome
to join us at the harbor,
Your Majesty.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.500
Come along, Naomi.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.500
We have a lot of
cleaning up to do.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.830
Sorry it didn't
work out, Elena.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.960
Naomi, I...

15:15.960 --> 15:19.290
- We better get going.
No!

15:19.290 --> 15:21.580
- I don't wanna go, Dad.
- You don't have to go.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.170
We could all go
back to the castle.

15:23.170 --> 15:26.620
Thank you, but we should
celebrate Navidad

15:26.620 --> 15:29.710
in our village, the way
we always have.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.790
I wanna go home.

15:36.790 --> 15:38.670
Isabel!

15:38.670 --> 15:41.170
Sometimes, no matter
how hard you try,

15:41.170 --> 15:43.210
you can't make
everyone happy.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.330
It would've been fine
if they didn't all try

15:45.330 --> 15:46.790
to outdo each other.

15:46.790 --> 15:49.920
Some people
are too set in their ways.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.620
Let's go home, mi hija.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.250
You go on.

15:58.830 --> 16:02.500
This parade idea
got really out of control.

16:04.250 --> 16:05.580
Hmm.

16:05.580 --> 16:08.790
Naomi, why did everyone think
I was choosing a float

16:08.790 --> 16:10.790
to lead the parade?

16:10.790 --> 16:12.500
Doña Paloma told us.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.620
That's why
we bought the fountain.

16:13.620 --> 16:15.960
Let me guess.
At Doña 's store.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.670
Yeah. She gave us
a great deal.

16:17.670 --> 16:20.000
Did she now?

16:25.000 --> 16:28.250
It's going to be
a happy Navidad after all.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.670
ELENA: Doña Paloma.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.750
Princess Elena.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.960
Shouldn't you be
at the parade?

16:34.960 --> 16:37.540
There is no more parade,
thanks to you.

16:37.540 --> 16:39.380
Whatever do you mean?

16:39.380 --> 16:41.540
You got them all
so competitive,

16:41.540 --> 16:42.750
they wound up
crashing the floats.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.420
What a shame.

16:45.420 --> 16:47.620
They could always buy
new decorations.

16:47.620 --> 16:51.540
Navidad isn't about who
has the best decorations
or traditions.

16:51.540 --> 16:54.580
You're right. It should
be about who has the most.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.330
So that's what
the holidays mean
to you... money?

16:57.330 --> 17:01.170
Dear, that's what
every day means to me.

17:01.170 --> 17:03.750
All Isabel wanted
was to spend the holiday

17:03.750 --> 17:05.460
with her friend.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.790
But because of
your scheme, she can't.

17:07.790 --> 17:10.750
Well, I do feel bad
about that,

17:10.750 --> 17:13.580
so why don't you pick out
a gift for her?

17:13.580 --> 17:16.620
Anything in the store,
free of charge.

17:16.620 --> 17:18.290
Consider it
a Navidad present

17:18.290 --> 17:20.880
from Doña Paloma.

17:20.880 --> 17:24.080
Come on.
I'll drive you back
to the palace.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.620
This whole day,
everyone got so caught up

17:26.620 --> 17:30.420
in their traditions
and decorations and gifts.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.580
They forgot the one thing

17:32.580 --> 17:35.080
that Isabel and Cristina
knew right from the start.

17:35.080 --> 17:38.580
The holidays aren't about
what you do.

17:38.580 --> 17:40.170
They're about
who you spend them with.

17:40.170 --> 17:42.580
Hey.

17:42.580 --> 17:44.000
Huh?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.750
You know what, Gabe?

17:46.750 --> 17:48.330
I think I'm gonna take
Doña Paloma up on her offer.

17:48.330 --> 17:49.920
We're going on
a parranda.

17:53.620 --> 17:56.790
A parranda? How is
caroling gonna help?

17:56.790 --> 17:58.540
Because it's more
than just caroling.

17:58.540 --> 18:03.120
