WEBVTT

00:00.148 --> 00:03.069
Good morning, everyone.

00:03.071 --> 00:06.257
Hey, who here likes cash, huh?

00:09.428 --> 00:11.296
Oh, good, I'm glad you're excited,

00:11.330 --> 00:13.398
because our computer system is down,

00:13.432 --> 00:15.734
so today all we can take is cash.

00:15.768 --> 00:17.135
- What?
- Why are you waving

00:17.169 --> 00:18.036
the cash around like that?

00:18.070 --> 00:20.071
I thought it would make you excited.

00:20.106 --> 00:22.407
Like I was gonna give you
the cash or something.

00:22.441 --> 00:24.275
- Yeah.
- Hey, where's Amy?

00:24.310 --> 00:25.677
Oh, she's been late a lot lately.

00:25.711 --> 00:28.246
Last Thursday, last Monday.
Thursday before that.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.415
Oh, no. What if Emma was kidnapped?

00:30.449 --> 00:31.750
Yeah, what if she's getting kidnapped

00:31.784 --> 00:33.785
every Monday and Thursday morning?

00:33.819 --> 00:36.755
It has nothing to do with Emma, okay?

00:36.789 --> 00:39.658
It's a personal thing.
End of conversation.

00:39.692 --> 00:41.259
- Is it?
- Beginning of conversation.

00:41.293 --> 00:43.528
- "Personal thing"?
- Oh, my God, is she sick?

00:43.562 --> 00:45.430
Zika, I bet. Everyone's getting Zika.

00:45.464 --> 00:47.098
You know what? It's probably drugs.

00:47.133 --> 00:48.166
You can tell from her teeth.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.768
It is not drugs!

00:49.802 --> 00:51.770
It's just marriage counseling.

00:51.804 --> 00:53.138
What?

00:53.172 --> 00:55.206
How is that worse than drugs?

00:55.241 --> 00:56.675
Is Amy gonna get divorced?

00:56.709 --> 00:58.843
Look, I shouldn't have
said anything, okay?

00:58.878 --> 01:01.146
Look, Adam hasn't even moved out.

01:01.180 --> 01:02.781
He's just sleeping in the basement.

01:02.815 --> 01:03.581
- What?
- Shut up!

01:03.616 --> 01:05.784
How is that worse than divorce?

01:05.818 --> 01:07.285
- Oh, my God.
- That is so bad.

01:07.319 --> 01:08.853
She told me this in confidence.

01:08.888 --> 01:12.390
So, you know, just clam
up your face holes.

01:12.425 --> 01:14.392
Here she is. Shut up.
Just shut up, just shut up!

01:14.427 --> 01:15.894
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Be normal, be normal.

01:15.928 --> 01:16.895
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Be normal!

01:18.364 --> 01:20.632
Sorry I'm late. Traffic.

01:20.666 --> 01:22.667
It's okay.

01:22.702 --> 01:25.236
Oh, man, traffic will slow things down.

01:25.271 --> 01:26.671
Oh, dude, especially
in this town, you know?

01:26.706 --> 01:29.207
- With all the cars.
- Traffic.

01:36.849 --> 01:37.949
Sorry.

01:40.962 --> 01:43.964
Oh, okay. So everybody knows
about my counseling.

01:43.999 --> 01:46.267
Well, they do now!

01:48.163 --> 01:51.358

01:54.976 --> 01:56.210
Oh, hey.

01:56.244 --> 02:00.147
I just wanted to let you know
I restocked all the toothpaste

02:00.182 --> 02:03.617
that Myrtle decided looked
"just fine" in electronics, so...

02:03.652 --> 02:05.886
And?

02:05.921 --> 02:07.955
And... what?

02:07.989 --> 02:09.256
Well, I know there's more.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.925
No, there's not. There's just...

02:10.959 --> 02:13.394
There's just no shame in counseling.

02:13.428 --> 02:15.296
- Is all I'm saying.
- And there it is.

02:15.330 --> 02:17.932
No. Mental health is important
and it shouldn't be stigmatized.

02:17.966 --> 02:19.934
- I think it's ridiculous that...
- Jonah, please stop.

02:19.968 --> 02:22.937
I know you're trying to help me
and I really appreciate it,

02:22.971 --> 02:25.072
but I don't want to talk about it, okay?

02:25.106 --> 02:28.509
I don't. I just want everybody
to treat me normally.

02:28.543 --> 02:29.643
Okay?

02:29.678 --> 02:31.178
Oh, hey, Sandra, I...

02:31.213 --> 02:33.013
- Shh.
- Oh, God.

02:33.048 --> 02:35.916
It's okay.

02:35.951 --> 02:37.251
You are loved.

02:37.285 --> 02:39.954
Mm-hmm.

02:39.988 --> 02:42.490
Hey, Adam, it's Carol at Cloud 9.

02:42.524 --> 02:45.626
I got your number off of
Amy's emergency contact form.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.251
I heard about you and Amy,

02:47.252 --> 02:49.430
and I just wanted to see
how you were you-ing.

02:49.464 --> 02:51.932
"Youing"? How you were doing.

02:53.134 --> 02:54.969
Why am I so nervous?

02:55.003 --> 02:58.606
You trusted me with a secret,
and I betrayed you.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.974
I'm a monster.

03:00.008 --> 03:01.709
If you want, you can tell everyone

03:01.743 --> 03:04.278
something embarrassing about me.

03:04.312 --> 03:08.682
A tiny spider once crawled
into the entrance of my...

03:10.719 --> 03:13.153
Okay, I just... I don't really

03:13.188 --> 03:14.955
wanna talk about this anymore.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.324
Oh, Franklin and Bash, gabbin' away.

03:17.359 --> 03:18.692
- What you talking about?
- Nothing.

03:18.727 --> 03:20.294
- Spider story.
- Amy!

03:20.328 --> 03:22.062
Listen. Buck up, buttercup.

03:22.097 --> 03:24.031
I know exactly what you need.

03:24.065 --> 03:25.633
Ladies' lunch.

03:25.667 --> 03:28.702
Huh? You, me, whoever, not Glenn.

03:28.737 --> 03:31.205
Um... yeah, no.

03:31.239 --> 03:33.073
I'm not really in the mood.

03:33.108 --> 03:35.643
Come on. We can gab and dish

03:35.677 --> 03:37.478
and talk about our periods.

03:37.512 --> 03:39.580
Your red zone usually starts
around the 24th, right?

03:39.614 --> 03:42.216
Wha... is that something
I'm supposed to know?

03:42.250 --> 03:43.984
I am the worst friend.

03:44.019 --> 03:45.319
Yeah, you are.

03:45.353 --> 03:47.087
Guys, it's not that big a deal.

03:47.122 --> 03:48.522
It's just counseling.

03:48.557 --> 03:50.257
- They're gonna be fine.
- Yeah, but if

03:50.292 --> 03:52.059
the marriage goes pffft...

03:52.093 --> 03:53.327
I call dibs on Amy.

03:53.361 --> 03:55.663
But you can't just call dibs on a human.

03:55.697 --> 03:57.031
Why, did you already call it?

03:57.065 --> 03:58.065
Did I? No, I... no.

03:58.099 --> 04:00.334
- I don't have any interest in...
- He's already got

04:00.368 --> 04:01.535
- a girlfriend.
- Oh.

04:01.570 --> 04:03.604
No, actually, Naomi and I broke up.

04:03.638 --> 04:06.073
- Whoa!
- Because of Amy?

04:06.107 --> 04:08.776
No, gross. Because she thought
of me more as a brother.

04:08.810 --> 04:11.111
But you don't have dibs on Amy, then.

04:11.146 --> 04:13.180
- No.
- Cool. Dibs! Dibs infinity!

04:13.214 --> 04:15.549
No takebacks. Mm! Yeah!

04:15.584 --> 04:17.084
Durbs!

04:17.786 --> 04:20.521
I feel so bad for her.

04:20.555 --> 04:23.524
Oh, she is <i>this close to a breakdown.</i>

04:23.558 --> 04:25.259
I know.

04:25.293 --> 04:27.728
I don't know what I
would do without Jeff.

04:29.564 --> 04:32.132
I can't believe she's still
pretending to be dating Jeff.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.467
I'm dating Jeff, okay?

04:33.501 --> 04:34.635
She's dating no one.

04:34.669 --> 04:36.370
That's how the world works.

04:36.404 --> 04:40.374
Someone sounds jealous.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

04:50.418 --> 04:52.820
I wish there were some customers here.

04:52.854 --> 04:55.756
I can't believe I just said that.

04:57.459 --> 04:58.726
Ooh, nice assist!

04:58.760 --> 05:00.761
Hey, I played basketball
when I was a kid

05:00.795 --> 05:02.910
until my parents let me stop.

05:02.911 --> 05:04.945
- Okay, well...
- Oh, hey, check it out.

05:04.980 --> 05:06.914
- Moving target.
- Oh, bring it on.

05:06.948 --> 05:09.617
- Three points.
- Okay.

05:09.651 --> 05:11.519
- Hey, oh!
- Oh, yeah!

05:11.553 --> 05:13.187
In your face, Brett!

05:13.221 --> 05:14.588
<i>Wait, I don't get it.</i>

05:14.623 --> 05:16.257
It's one of the slowest days
we've ever had.

05:16.291 --> 05:18.225
Why can't one of the
warehouse guys load this?

05:18.260 --> 05:19.860
I don't know. Dina just told me to

05:19.895 --> 05:22.196
and when I asked her why,
she said, "Shut up, Sandra."

05:22.230 --> 05:23.631
Shut up, Sandra!

05:23.665 --> 05:25.199
- What are you...
- Ladies' lunch.

05:25.233 --> 05:27.067
No. No! No!

05:27.102 --> 05:29.904
<i>I said no!</i>

05:38.822 --> 05:40.323
This is for your own good.

05:40.357 --> 05:41.824
Yeah, you didn't have to
kidnap me, Dina.

05:41.859 --> 05:43.326
Kidnapping is what you do to children.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.495
You're pushing 40. I abducted you.

05:45.536 --> 05:49.165
All right, everybody. First
on the agenda: free talk.

05:49.199 --> 05:51.534
A couple of ground rules. No shop talk.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.870
Also, no religion or politics.
Too divisive.

05:53.904 --> 05:55.671
Also, don't tell a story about someone

05:55.706 --> 05:56.906
we don't all know.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.875
It makes people feel excluded.

05:58.909 --> 06:01.511
Other than that, sky's the limit.

06:06.750 --> 06:09.419
Have you guys heard
the new Fetty Wap song?

06:09.453 --> 06:11.320
We're not talking about music!

06:11.355 --> 06:12.555
Okay? That's just a bunch of sounds,

06:12.589 --> 06:13.923
and I can hear that anywhere.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.392
Three, two, one!

06:16.427 --> 06:18.060
Muffin ball!

06:18.095 --> 06:21.364
- Into the mop bucket!
- Yes, that's a niner!

06:21.398 --> 06:22.498
He's looking to ten it.

06:22.533 --> 06:23.866
- Oh!
- Ow!

06:23.901 --> 06:25.435
- Oh!
- You guys!

06:25.469 --> 06:27.370
Are you literally insane?

06:27.404 --> 06:28.671
Sorry, Mateo. Could you throw us back

06:28.705 --> 06:29.472
the muffin ball, though?

06:29.506 --> 06:31.707
I could. But I won't.

06:31.742 --> 06:33.956
Hey, yo, you know what?

06:33.957 --> 06:35.891
- We should get blockers.
- I was just gonna say that.

06:35.926 --> 06:37.493
Hey, thanks, Mateo!

06:37.527 --> 06:38.661
I'm having a lot of fun with you.

06:38.695 --> 06:40.596
Don't ever say that to me again.

06:40.631 --> 06:42.265
Just get the blockers.

06:42.299 --> 06:45.234
Can I start you ladies off
with some drinks, or...

06:45.269 --> 06:46.736
No, we don't drink.

06:46.770 --> 06:47.937
Can you imagine?

06:47.971 --> 06:49.839
CUT TO: glug, glug, glug, glug.

06:51.708 --> 06:54.510
Oh, uh, white wine. Two ice cubes.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.846
I'll take a Rusty Spaniard.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.914
- I'm gonna have to see some ID.
- Are you kidding?

06:58.949 --> 07:00.683
Look at her face. She's, like, 2,000.

07:00.717 --> 07:03.185
This is embarrassing.

07:03.220 --> 07:06.754
I left my ID at the lawyer office.

07:07.491 --> 07:09.258
That's fine. What do you want?

07:09.293 --> 07:11.961
I'll have four beers, please.

07:11.995 --> 07:15.364
How about we order our
meals at the same time

07:15.399 --> 07:16.866
and then maybe you can
just bring the check now.

07:16.900 --> 07:17.933
That would be great. Thank you.

07:17.968 --> 07:21.203
So what is fast?

07:21.238 --> 07:23.406
All right, Marcus, alley-oop
me into the cooler, okay?

07:23.440 --> 07:25.308
Now, Brett, come back,
come back, come back!

07:25.342 --> 07:27.243
- Oh, no!
- Damn it!

07:27.277 --> 07:28.311
He's got the moves like Jagger.

07:28.345 --> 07:30.246
- That's your fault, Marcus.
- Me? Get your head

07:30.280 --> 07:32.315
- in the game, man.
- Mateo tattles me

07:32.349 --> 07:34.450
that you're playing a game
instead of working.

07:34.484 --> 07:35.651
Seriously, dude?

07:35.686 --> 07:36.952
Yeah, you're misusing baked goods

07:36.987 --> 07:38.888
and hurting people's cashmere, so...

07:38.922 --> 07:40.456
- Come on, man.
- I'm sorry,

07:40.490 --> 07:42.258
but this game is over, okay?

07:42.292 --> 07:44.493
I'm throwing this away.

07:44.528 --> 07:45.494
Oh!

07:45.529 --> 07:46.429
- Did you see that?
- What?

07:46.463 --> 07:49.565
Glenn, you just got a mannequin bumper.

07:49.599 --> 07:50.599
Is that good?

07:50.634 --> 07:52.301
- Uhh!
- Phew, I don't know.

07:52.336 --> 07:54.003
- Is the best you can do good?
- Whoo.

07:54.037 --> 07:55.638
Come on, you had to play this before.

07:55.672 --> 07:57.573
No, I swear. I mean, I'm on

07:57.607 --> 07:59.342
my church's Wiffle ball team.

07:59.376 --> 08:01.243
Well, I get the emails.

08:01.278 --> 08:02.044
Ooh, well, I don't know.

08:02.079 --> 08:03.579
I mean, I'd say you're a natural.

08:03.613 --> 08:04.847
- I mean, that was incredible.
- Mm-hmm.

08:04.881 --> 08:06.349
- Yeah?
- Glenn, they're obviously

08:06.383 --> 08:08.451
- manipulating you.
- You're just jealous

08:08.485 --> 08:11.354
because I got a manne-bump
on my first try.

08:11.388 --> 08:13.456
Please! Anyone can hit
that stupid mannequin.

08:13.490 --> 08:15.291
- Really?
- Prove it.

08:18.295 --> 08:19.295
- Oh!
- Ho!

08:19.329 --> 08:21.030
- Nice, Mateo!
- Oh, yeah!

08:21.064 --> 08:22.331
- I did it.
- Yeah.

08:22.366 --> 08:24.033
- Yeah, you did.
- I'm an athlete.

08:24.067 --> 08:25.534
- Hey!
- I'm an athlete.

08:25.569 --> 08:27.870
I did it! I'm Simone Biles!

08:27.904 --> 08:29.772
- I'm Simone Biles!
- Who?

08:29.806 --> 08:31.340
Yes! Simone Biles!

08:31.375 --> 08:33.342
- The Olympic gymnast.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

08:35.412 --> 08:36.946
- Ohh, thank you.
- Okay, so...

08:36.980 --> 08:38.447
why don't we go around the circle

08:38.482 --> 08:41.015
and each name our favorite
part of the penis?

08:41.051 --> 08:43.519
I'll go first. The bottom.

08:44.588 --> 08:46.355
So, Cheyenne,

08:46.390 --> 08:48.057
how are things with you and Bo?

08:48.091 --> 08:50.292
Great. You know, same old Bo.

08:50.327 --> 08:53.295
Little dangerous, little mysterious,

08:53.330 --> 08:55.297
little dyslexic.

08:55.332 --> 08:58.367
He recently lost his flip-flops
so, you know...

08:58.410 --> 08:59.931
ups and downs.

09:00.712 --> 09:03.681
And, um, Sandra, you're still with Jeff?

09:03.715 --> 09:06.417
Um, yeah. It's fine.

09:06.451 --> 09:08.519
- It's fine?
- This is ladies' lunch, Sandra.

09:08.554 --> 09:09.654
We need deets.

09:09.688 --> 09:11.898
Oh, okay. Um...

09:13.458 --> 09:15.660
We spend hours on the phone,

09:15.694 --> 09:17.695
just talking.

09:17.729 --> 09:19.606
He loves my taste in music.

09:20.365 --> 09:22.875
I spend the night at his hotel
when he's in town.

09:23.635 --> 09:25.436
We make love on silk sheets.

09:26.405 --> 09:29.440
Oh, God, he's... gentle

09:29.474 --> 09:31.776
and strong.

09:31.810 --> 09:34.278
Sometimes he's dark.

09:34.313 --> 09:36.881
He took me to the edge
of his balcony once

09:36.915 --> 09:39.336
and he asked, "Are you afraid?"

09:40.419 --> 09:42.338
And I said, "Yes."

09:43.355 --> 09:44.653
And he said, "Good."

09:45.190 --> 09:47.291
That's how I feel with you."

09:48.894 --> 09:50.380
And then we made love.

09:51.496 --> 09:53.831
- And then we ate dinner.
- Mm...

09:53.865 --> 09:56.492
And it was fancy.

09:57.669 --> 10:00.304
He thinks I'm prettier than my sister.

10:04.710 --> 10:06.210
Yeah.

10:07.846 --> 10:09.180
So when you say the bottom,

10:09.214 --> 10:12.149
you mean the base
or, like, the underside?

10:12.184 --> 10:15.386
Um, I'd have to say,
like, just the full underneath.

10:15.420 --> 10:16.487
Mm-hmm.

10:16.521 --> 10:18.322
Loose muffin! Loose muffin!

10:38.143 --> 10:41.345
Go, go, go, go, go!

10:41.380 --> 10:42.346
Yeah!

10:46.318 --> 10:47.318
Go ahead, man. Shoot!

10:47.352 --> 10:49.353
You got nothing, bro.
Take a shot, I dare you.

10:49.388 --> 10:51.522
Take it easy, jeez.

10:51.556 --> 10:53.524
Oh, yeah? What are you
gonna do about it?

10:53.558 --> 10:54.925
Call your girlfriend Amy?

10:54.960 --> 10:56.794
What? No. That's... why would I...

10:56.828 --> 10:57.695
Boom!

10:57.729 --> 10:59.864
- I'm the muffin man now, bitch!
- That's

10:59.898 --> 11:01.969
Hey, Adam. It's Carol.

11:01.970 --> 11:04.476
I had a missed call
from an unknown caller.

11:04.476 --> 11:06.907
I thought maybe that was you.

11:06.942 --> 11:09.677
Anyways, I'm at lunch with you know who.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.345
Awkward!

11:11.380 --> 11:13.948
Okay, this is gonna sound so naughty,

11:13.982 --> 11:15.516
but should we get
another round of drinks?

11:15.550 --> 11:17.918
We shouldn't, should we?

11:17.953 --> 11:19.487
Nope. We should really get going.

11:19.521 --> 11:21.455
You're not even trying to have fun.

11:21.490 --> 11:23.257
And Myrtle's not done yet.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.426
Look, I really appreciate

11:25.460 --> 11:26.927
this gesture, I do.

11:26.962 --> 11:28.696
This was very nice of you,

11:28.730 --> 11:31.699
but this is... terrible.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.335
It's depressing and... and awkward.

11:34.369 --> 11:37.038
We have nothing to talk about.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.106
And I know this sounds weird,

11:39.141 --> 11:41.442
but this food smells like bowling.

11:41.476 --> 11:43.644
Yeah, um...

11:43.678 --> 11:45.279
Yeah, I'm sorry this wasn't perfect.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.314
It's actually the first
ladies' lunch I've ever thrown.

11:47.349 --> 11:50.151
I don't have a lot of
female friends, so, uh...

11:50.185 --> 11:53.087
Yeah, let's just get going.
This was stupid.

11:54.156 --> 11:56.157
No. We can stay.

11:56.191 --> 11:57.691
No, it's fine. Forget it, I'll just...

11:57.726 --> 11:59.360
I'll pay the check. Ron?

11:59.394 --> 12:01.529
No, no, no. We can stay, Dina.

12:01.563 --> 12:03.464
I want to stay.

12:06.004 --> 12:08.451
Ron, keep 'em coming!

12:08.494 --> 12:12.634
- Whoo!
- Bottoms up!

12:12.636 --> 12:14.537
Salute!

12:14.644 --> 12:17.279
Ugh! Okay, Cheyenne,

12:17.313 --> 12:20.415
Marcus, Brett, Peter. Go.

12:20.450 --> 12:23.719
Okay. I would bang Marcus...

12:23.752 --> 12:26.053
- Ugh!
- Marry Brett...

12:26.088 --> 12:28.456
and kill Bo's mom.

12:28.490 --> 12:31.225
No, Cheyenne, she's not an option.

12:31.259 --> 12:32.793
- That's not the game.
- I don't care.

12:32.828 --> 12:34.528
She sucks!

12:34.563 --> 12:37.298
Okay, um, okay.

12:37.332 --> 12:40.201
Glenn, Garrett and Darren.

12:40.235 --> 12:42.436
Okay, obviously, I'd kill Glenn.

12:42.471 --> 12:45.106
Um, probably just like slit his throat

12:45.140 --> 12:46.540
or tear him limb from limb.

12:46.575 --> 12:48.442
Uh, then I'd marry Darren,

12:48.477 --> 12:51.212
and I've already [Bleep]
Garrett, so I guess him again.

12:54.649 --> 12:57.284
No. No, no, no, really. I have.

12:57.319 --> 13:01.222
Don't know why we're laughing,
because I did.

13:03.158 --> 13:07.228
On Black Friday after we all got sick.

13:07.262 --> 13:10.731
I had to erase the
security camera footage.

13:15.270 --> 13:17.404
- Uh!
- E-excuse me!

13:17.439 --> 13:18.773
Where are the paper towels?

13:18.807 --> 13:21.609
I'm sorry, I don't think
we sell those here.

13:23.779 --> 13:26.180
I got it! I'm going for it!

13:26.214 --> 13:27.648
I'm going for it!

13:27.682 --> 13:30.251
Not in my store!

13:30.285 --> 13:31.252
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

13:31.286 --> 13:32.319
- Glenn.
- Oh, my...

13:32.354 --> 13:33.821
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

13:37.225 --> 13:40.427
I can see the whole store from up here.

13:40.462 --> 13:41.695
Oh, no.

13:41.730 --> 13:44.131
He's gonna be fine.

13:46.501 --> 13:49.203
Excuse me. Can I...

13:49.237 --> 13:51.205
Excuse me, sir?

13:51.239 --> 13:52.706
Sir, this lady here, she'd...
When you have a second.

13:52.741 --> 13:53.841
Sir?

13:55.877 --> 13:57.378
Thanks for trying.

13:57.412 --> 13:59.680
You're welcome.

13:59.714 --> 14:03.851
If you wanna sit here
while you wait, you can.

14:03.885 --> 14:04.686
Okay.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.289
I'll sit.

14:08.323 --> 14:11.225
So do you think you and Adam
will stay together?

14:11.259 --> 14:12.827
- Of course.
- Mm-hmm.

14:12.861 --> 14:15.129
I think. I don't know. I mean...

14:15.163 --> 14:17.531
Look, Adam and I have been together

14:17.566 --> 14:19.166
a really long time.

14:19.201 --> 14:21.802
And I just wanna know
that if we are together

14:21.837 --> 14:25.139
it's because we want to be,
and not because

14:25.173 --> 14:26.874
we're afraid of change.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.410
Oh, you know, if worse comes to worse,

14:29.444 --> 14:31.846
my cousin knows a divorce
lawyer in Little Rock.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.414
Three jet skis in that garage.

14:33.448 --> 14:34.951
You'd be in good hands.

14:34.952 --> 14:36.051
Thanks.

14:36.086 --> 14:39.622
But I'm not good at change.
I-I never change anything.

14:39.657 --> 14:44.627
I've had the same haircut
since I was in high school.

14:44.662 --> 14:47.363
- Whoa!
- And every now and then

14:47.398 --> 14:50.533
I'm like, maybe I'll change my hair.

14:50.568 --> 14:53.636
And then... I don't.

14:55.439 --> 14:56.906
I should not be drinking this!

14:56.941 --> 14:59.609
I am so out of control!

15:01.445 --> 15:04.547
Oh. You okay?

15:04.582 --> 15:06.416
No, I'm... I'm fine.

15:06.450 --> 15:11.220
I just wanna relax here
on the beach for a while.

15:12.189 --> 15:14.057
And since Brett's knee is still injured

15:14.091 --> 15:16.559
from his MMA fight, Jonah will be

15:16.594 --> 15:18.561
taking his place in the final shootout.

15:19.997 --> 15:22.398
His opponent will be decided
by a simple...

15:22.433 --> 15:24.000
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

15:24.034 --> 15:26.436
I wasn't finished talking,
but I guess this game

15:26.470 --> 15:28.104
has made monsters out of all of us.

15:28.138 --> 15:30.440
All right, this is it.

15:30.474 --> 15:31.641
Winner gets Amy.

15:31.675 --> 15:34.010
You... what... you can't win a person

15:34.044 --> 15:35.979
by throwing a taped up
muffin at a bucket.

15:36.013 --> 15:40.416
Oh, yeah? Then what's this?

15:40.451 --> 15:41.918
- Boom!
- Yes!

15:41.952 --> 15:45.655
- USA! USA!
- USA! USA!

15:45.689 --> 15:47.624
We all live here.

15:47.658 --> 15:49.425
When he confronted the witches,

15:49.460 --> 15:51.427
it really grounded him.

15:51.462 --> 15:53.630
Exactly.

15:53.664 --> 15:56.265
Does your husband or boyfriend

15:56.300 --> 15:58.101
like "Vampire Diaries"
as much as you do?

15:58.135 --> 16:00.470
Oh, I'm not seeing anyone.

16:00.504 --> 16:01.924
What about Jeff?

16:02.973 --> 16:06.342
- Who's Jeff?
- Her serious boyfriend.

16:08.012 --> 16:12.682
Oh, right. I do have a boyfriend.

16:15.052 --> 16:17.286
Sorry. 'Scuse me.

16:20.424 --> 16:22.558
Hi. Carol.

16:22.593 --> 16:26.729
Oh! I'm gonna get another Long
Island iced tea, beyotches!

16:26.764 --> 16:29.632
Whoo! ALL: Whoo!

16:31.535 --> 16:32.969
Diet Coke, please.

16:33.003 --> 16:35.471
It all comes down to this.

16:35.506 --> 16:38.041
They call him the Comeback Kid.

16:38.075 --> 16:42.045
But not a person in this place
thinks he can make this shot.

16:42.079 --> 16:45.481
He has absolutely no
athletic ability whatsoever.

16:45.516 --> 16:48.384
- Uh, okay.
- Never, in the history of sport

16:48.419 --> 16:51.521
has someone less qualified
stepped up to the plate.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.025
Oh!

17:01.699 --> 17:05.068
- Ooh! Team USA wins!
- Yes!

17:05.102 --> 17:07.103
- I win Amy.
- No. You don't win Amy!

17:07.137 --> 17:10.039
Nobody wins Amy! You don't get Amy!

17:12.710 --> 17:14.743
Wait, dude. Are you playing for Amy?

17:14.778 --> 17:16.345
Uh... no, I...

17:16.380 --> 17:18.247
Jonah, she's just in counseling.

17:18.281 --> 17:20.782
It doesn't mean her marriage is over.

17:20.818 --> 17:24.787
I know that. That's...
that's exactly my...

17:24.821 --> 17:26.589
Marcus keeps...

17:29.159 --> 17:33.229

17:53.189 --> 17:55.189
I can't fall.

17:55.190 --> 17:57.190
Ow. Funny.

18:03.769 --> 18:05.736
Something looks different.

18:07.606 --> 18:08.884
What's up, Ames?

18:09.808 --> 18:11.909
Um...'sup?

18:11.943 --> 18:15.306
Hey, uh... keep me posted on things.

18:16.114 --> 18:17.548
What are you talking about?

18:17.582 --> 18:21.040
Just... whatever.

18:22.449 --> 18:23.850
I'm around.

18:27.787 --> 18:30.756
Hmm. Did that make sense to you?

18:30.790 --> 18:32.924
No.

18:32.959 --> 18:34.250
Good.

18:51.674 --> 18:53.542
Hello... hello, Glenn.
Good mor... afternoon.

18:53.576 --> 18:55.310
Good afternoon to you.

18:55.344 --> 18:58.980
How far would I have to
drive to see a prairie?

19:00.349 --> 19:02.551
I'm on it. I'll find that out right now.

19:02.585 --> 19:04.319
Thank you.

19:04.353 --> 19:06.054
Just in a second.

19:06.088 --> 19:07.322
Are you okay?

19:07.356 --> 19:09.157
Uh, yeah. I'm okay.

19:09.192 --> 19:11.760
'Cause I am a professional, so...

19:11.794 --> 19:13.628
You want me to touch my
nose with my finger?

19:13.663 --> 19:14.629
No problem.

19:14.664 --> 19:16.565
Okay? You want me to do
the alphabet backwards?

19:16.599 --> 19:20.235
Sure. Z, Y...

19:23.706 --> 19:25.140
X.

19:25.863 --> 19:29.325
Is, uh... so you might hear

19:29.326 --> 19:31.146
something kinda funny.

19:31.180 --> 19:32.481
It's real funny.

19:32.515 --> 19:35.750
Um, to be clear, I don't
think I can win you.

19:35.785 --> 19:39.454
I mean... and I wouldn't
want to, even if I could.

19:39.489 --> 19:42.157
You know, people. We all win whoever,

19:42.191 --> 19:44.726
together, sexually.

19:46.229 --> 19:50.432
I can't follow you
because you talk so much.

19:50.466 --> 19:52.200
- I'm sorry...
- And... and also,

19:52.235 --> 19:54.536
I'm a little bit drunk.

19:54.570 --> 19:55.837
I'm sor...

19:55.872 --> 19:57.606
I'm a little bit drunk.

19:57.640 --> 20:02.544
Yes... you are so drunk.

20:02.578 --> 20:04.379
- Yes.
- Whoo.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.682
I'm so sorry. You were saying

20:07.717 --> 20:09.217
something about... I don't-what was I...

20:09.252 --> 20:10.619
- Who cares?
- A sexual...

20:10.653 --> 20:13.121
Oh, oh, Amy. Whoa. That's... okay...

20:13.155 --> 20:14.881
This is a workplace, okay?

20:15.022 --> 20:16.858
We don't talk like that here.

20:16.893 --> 20:19.561
You should get on home
with that kind of talk.

20:19.595 --> 20:22.565
'Cause this... I don't know
what this is, but it's wrong.

20:27.403 --> 20:29.571
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

20:30.918 --> 20:32.652
Okay, I think we're done.

20:34.110 --> 20:37.078
What do you think?

20:37.113 --> 20:40.248
Oh... yeah.

20:40.283 --> 20:42.717
This really, um...

20:42.752 --> 20:44.252
It's... it's subtle.

20:44.287 --> 20:46.755

20:46.789 --> 20:49.224
You know, baby steps, right?

20:49.258 --> 20:52.594

20:52.628 --> 20:54.195
Also, I'm drunk.

20:54.230 --> 20:56.665
Yeah, no, I...

20:56.699 --> 20:58.600
I like it, I like it.

20:58.634 --> 21:01.736
What? Did I cut too much off?

21:01.771 --> 21:03.438

21:03.472 --> 21:07.909
No. No, no. I was just, um...

21:07.944 --> 21:10.111
I don't know. I was, like,

21:10.146 --> 21:14.616
thinking something more, like,

21:17.620 --> 21:19.421
