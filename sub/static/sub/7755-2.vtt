>> Oh, I'm so pleased you like
it.

14:10.650 --> 14:14.586
>> Gumball: I use it to steal
girls from people!
>> Who are you talking about?

14:14.588 --> 14:17.055
>> Darwin: Gumball's jealous of
Leslie.
>> Leslie? Why?

14:17.057 --> 14:22.193
>> Gumball: Because he's trying
to steal my girl!!
>> You know, you should

14:22.195 --> 14:24.762
seriously consider becoming a
carnivore.
>> Why?

14:24.764 --> 14:28.633
>> Because before it ends up on
your plate, this is what they do
to vegetables!

14:28.635 --> 14:32.003
>> Uh-huh. Yeah.
I'm not sure baloney's such a
good option, though.

14:32.005 --> 14:36.040
>> At least I'm not eating my
own kind.
[ Muffled ]

14:36.042 --> 14:41.512
>> Uh-huh.
>> [ Muffled ]
>> Yeah.

14:41.514 --> 14:46.918
>> [ Muffled ]
>> Mm-hmm.
>> [ Muffled ]

14:46.920 --> 14:54.025
>> Gumball: Aaah! [ Grunting ]
Curse this feeble body!
You should work out more.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.661
[ Grunting ]
>> Gumball, what is wrong with
you?

14:56.663 --> 14:59.964
>> Gumball: What's wrong with
<i>you?!</i>
Hanging out with this loser

14:59.966 --> 15:03.201
instead of me!
>> Come on, Leslie.
Let's get out of here here.

15:03.203 --> 15:06.771
>> Gumball: [ Sputters ]
[ Normal voice ] Penny, I'm so
sorry!

15:06.773 --> 15:10.208
[ Evilly ] No, I'm not!
[ Normal voice ] Shut up!
[ Evilly ] You're pathetic!

15:10.210 --> 15:13.912
[ Normal voice ]<i> You're</i>
pathetic, you insecure weirdo!
Oh.

15:13.914 --> 15:19.284
[ Sighs ]
[ Laughs ]
[ Evilly ] Looks like I'm gonna

15:19.286 --> 15:23.288
have to secure this myself!
>> Wow.
>> Darwin: I know.

15:23.290 --> 15:27.225
I've never seen him like this
before.
>> Gumball: And the case is

15:27.227 --> 15:32.263
solved!
Commissioner brown, arrest this
man!

15:32.265 --> 15:37.001
>> What are you talking about?
>> Gumball: The case of the
stolen trophy, which i have just

15:37.003 --> 15:41.172
found in his conveniently open
locker.
>> Principal brown, i think it's

15:41.174 --> 15:44.375
pretty obvious what's happened
here.
>> He did it.

15:44.377 --> 15:49.881
>> Gumball: [ Chuckles ]
Ah, um, see you later.
[ Normal voice ] Huh? What?

15:49.883 --> 15:54.485
What's going on?
>> Uh, what's going on is that
we're about to open your locker

15:54.487 --> 15:58.089
and find a crowbar.
>> Gumball: Uh...Okay.
[ Evilly ] Dude, i wouldn't do

15:58.091 --> 16:01.159
that if i were you.
[ Normal voice ] Why?
What have you made me do now?

16:01.161 --> 16:07.432
[ Clanking ]
[ Honk! ]
What's all this?!

16:07.434 --> 16:11.235
[ Evilly ] Uh...Plan b?
[ Normal voice ] Ha-ha-ha.
Well, at least there's no

16:11.237 --> 16:16.441
crowbar.
[ Clang! ]
>> Wow.

16:16.443 --> 16:22.146
>> I know, right?
>> Gumball, i think you owe
Leslie an apology.

16:22.148 --> 16:26.384
>> Gumball: I would apologize,
but...He'll beat me up again.
>> Oh!

16:26.386 --> 16:29.554
I'll do nothing of the sort.
>> Gumball: Not you. Him.
>> Who?

16:29.556 --> 16:33.358
>> Gumball: [ Evilly ] Me!
You nectar-faced, co2-breathing,
self-pollinating,

16:33.360 --> 16:36.561
photosynthesizing...
Root-drinking, deciduous,
petal-headed punk!

16:36.563 --> 16:40.131
>> See?! He hates me!
It's been like this all day.
>> Gumball: [ Normal voice ]

16:40.133 --> 16:44.602
Look, i don't hate you.
It's just...I'll explain
everything when i get out of

16:44.604 --> 16:47.538
prison.
>> Prison?
[ Chuckles ] Gumball, we're not

16:47.540 --> 16:50.208
the police.
>> Gumball: Wait.
You mean I'm not wearing

16:50.210 --> 16:53.111
handcuffs?
>> Of course not.
>> Gumball: [ Evilly ] Well,

16:53.113 --> 16:55.646
then good luck finding me in
Mexico.
[ Laughs ]

16:55.648 --> 17:05.289
Unh! [ Growls ]
Aah!
[ Grunting ]

17:05.291 --> 17:10.061
[ Groans ]
[ Door creaks ]
>> Gumball, please make an

17:10.063 --> 17:12.764
effort with Leslie.
>> Gumball: [ Normal voice ]
Yeah, okay.

17:12.766 --> 17:17.502
[ Birds chirping ]
[ Sighs ]
I'm pleased we got to spend this

17:17.504 --> 17:19.904
time together.
>> Me, too.
Penny was right.

17:19.906 --> 17:24.275
We do have a lot in common.
>> Gumball: Phew, it's hot.
[ Gasps ] Oh!

17:24.277 --> 17:29.747
A bench in the shade.
[ Laughs ]
>> [ Laughs ]

17:29.749 --> 17:33.718
[ Both sigh ]
[ Both chuckle ]
You know, after today, i never

17:33.720 --> 17:36.988
really thought you and me would
become friends.
>> Gumball: [ Chuckles ]

17:36.990 --> 17:42.193
Well, i guess sometimes life is
just full of...
[ Evilly ] Surprise!

17:42.195 --> 17:47.298
>> Aaaah!
>> Gumball: Ah, i see you've met
my hungry, little friends.

17:47.300 --> 17:52.670
>> I can't move!
>> Gumball: That's right!
I glued you to the bench!

17:52.672 --> 17:58.843
[ Laughs evilly ]
I guess we won't be insect-ing
you at school tomorrow.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.913
[ Cackles ]
Wait, wait.
I-i can do better.

18:01.915 --> 18:07.051
[ Inhales sharply ]
We'll see how pretty you look
after this, larvae-boy!

18:07.053 --> 18:11.989
No, still not good enough.
[ Inhales sharply ]
That'll teach you for being a

18:11.991 --> 18:18.463
creepy-crawler...Ahh, you get
the point.
>> Aaaaaaaah!

18:18.465 --> 18:22.667
[ Bell ringing ]
>> I'm so pleased you and Leslie
are finally getting along.

18:22.669 --> 18:26.003
>> Darwin: Yeah, because for
awhile there, i thought you
completely lost it.

18:26.005 --> 18:29.140
>> Where is he, by the way?
>> Gumball: [ Normal voice ] Eh,
he had to take care of something

18:29.142 --> 18:31.943
that was...[ Evilly ] Bugging
him!
[ Normal voice ] ¶ nailed it! ¶

18:31.945 --> 18:34.812
[ door opens ]
>> Penny, keep away from him!
He's insane!

18:34.814 --> 18:37.982
>> Gumball: [ Evilly ] How did
you get away?!
I glued you to the bench!

18:37.984 --> 18:40.818
>> You glued my pot to the
bench!
>> Oh, Leslie!

18:40.820 --> 18:44.122
Are you okay?
>> Gumball: Stay away from her!
Aah!

18:44.124 --> 18:47.024
>> Aaaaah!
>> Gumball: She loves me!
She loves you!

18:47.026 --> 18:50.528
She loves me!
>> Darwin, help!
>> Darwin: Dude, chill out.

18:50.530 --> 18:54.265
We need to do something.
I don't even recognize him
anymore.

18:54.267 --> 19:01.139
>> I think i know what to do.
[ Insects chirping ]
[ Owl hoots ]

19:01.141 --> 19:10.248
[ Match strikes ]
>> Gumball: [ Growling ]
>> don't break the circle of

19:10.250 --> 19:13.384
pepper.
It's our only protection.
>> From what?

19:13.386 --> 19:16.521
>> Jealousy.
It's taken possession of his
body.

19:16.523 --> 19:23.361
And it must be expelled!
>> Gumball: [ Growls ]
>> Gumball, if you're there,

19:23.363 --> 19:30.434
give us a sign.
>> Gumball: [ Exhales ]
>> Darwin: "Writing in versre

19:30.436 --> 19:36.340
is...Difficlut."
Yeah, that's gumball, all right.
>> Good. It's not too late.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.577
Now we must present the root of
his jealousy.
Leslie.

19:39.579 --> 19:43.447
>> Gumball: [ Growls ]
>> Take a step forward.
>> I feel like I'm close enough

19:43.449 --> 19:45.750
already.
How about you guys take a step
back?

19:45.752 --> 19:48.586
>> Gumball: Stupid pink petals!
Fat, yellow face!
Gaaah!

19:48.588 --> 19:51.489
>> [ Whimpers ]
Why is he so mean?
>> Darwin: Come on, man.

19:51.491 --> 19:55.393
His face isn't that fat.
>> It's just disproportionate
compared to his really weedy

19:55.395 --> 19:58.262
body.
>> Darwin: Yeah, and because
it's round, it's kind of

19:58.264 --> 20:01.933
full-looking, and the yellow
makes you focus on it.
>> So, if it is a little fat,

20:01.935 --> 20:05.536
it's not<i> that</i> fat.
It's just very, very plump.
>> Darwin: Fat-faced people have

20:05.538 --> 20:08.506
feelings, too, you know,
gumball.
>> All right, can we just get

20:08.508 --> 20:12.643
this done?
Carrie, what's the next step?
>> Everybody, join me.

20:12.645 --> 20:16.147
>> All: [ Chanting ] Jealousy,
be gone.
Jealousy, be gone.

20:16.149 --> 20:21.018
Jealousy, be gone.
>> Gumball: [ Grunting ]
>> All: Jealousy, be gone!

20:21.020 --> 20:30.361
Jealousy, be gone!
>> Gumball: Aaaaaah!
>> Darwin: What is that?

20:30.363 --> 20:33.998
>> It's jealousy in its purest
form.
>> Gumball: [ Coughs ]

20:34.000 --> 20:41.939
>> Gumball, are you all right?
>> No! No, don't!
>> [ Cackles ]

20:41.941 --> 20:45.910
Aaah!
How come you have more comic
books than i have?!

20:45.912 --> 20:51.082
That makes me angry!
[ Whip! ]
>> Darwin: Aah! Ooh! Aah!

20:51.084 --> 21:00.758
>> I want a TV in my room!
Hey, your bed's really sturdy!
Mine's not this well made!

21:00.760 --> 21:03.861
>> Darwin: Aaah!
>> Ohh, I've always wanted a
dimmer switch!

21:03.863 --> 21:06.697
>> Darwin: What do we do?!
>> I don't know!
>> Darwin: What do you mean, you

21:06.699 --> 21:08.766
don't know?
>> I just read about it on the
Internet.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.769
I didn't think it was gonna
work.
>> How many pairs of shoes do

21:11.771 --> 21:14.772
you need?
You don't even have feet!
[ Bang! ]

21:14.774 --> 21:18.809
>> Hey, over here, you green
freak!
>> Darwin: Leslie!

21:18.811 --> 21:23.347
>> [ Grumbles ] Huh?
[ Vacuum clicks ]
>> I got a vacuum bag with your

21:23.349 --> 21:28.419
name on it.
[ Vacuum whirs ]
Oh!

21:28.421 --> 21:34.325
[ Pop! ]
>> Gross.
>> Hmm.

21:34.327 --> 21:39.697
>> Aaaah!
[ Evilly ] I wish i had my own
bedroom like you!

21:39.699 --> 21:44.568
>> [ Evilly ] I wish i had my
own body like you!
>> Darwin: [ Grunting ]

21:44.570 --> 21:49.407
[ Evilly ] I'm actually quite
happy with my life.
>> And you!

21:49.409 --> 21:56.280
You betrayed me.
If i can't have you, nobody
will.

21:56.282 --> 22:01.719
[ Inhales deeply ]
>> Gumball: Aaah!
>> Darwin: What is he doing?

22:01.721 --> 22:05.356
>> He's gonna explode!
Gumball, you have to stop being
jealous!

22:05.358 --> 22:09.293
>> Gumball: I can't!
Not as long as penny's going out
with Leslie!

22:09.295 --> 22:12.496
>> Darwin: Aaah!
Penny, you got to break up with
Leslie!

22:12.498 --> 22:15.966
>> What are you talking about?
We're not dating.
We're cousi--

22:15.968 --> 22:20.438
[ bang ]
>> Gumball: Wait, did you just
say he was your cousin?

22:20.440 --> 22:24.008
>> Well, duh.
Everyone knows.
>> Gumball: Well, duh, i didn't.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.111
>> There's a lot of things you
don't know about me, gumball.
>> Gumball: Oh.

22:27.113 --> 22:33.551
>> All: Aaaah!
[ Thud ]
[ Insects chirping ]

22:33.553 --> 22:38.122
>> [ Sighs ]
>> Gumball: [ Sighs ]
I wish you said that earlier.

22:38.124 --> 22:41.425
>> Yeah, so do i.
>> Gumball: Sorry, man.
I just didn't know.

22:41.427 --> 22:45.496
>> Well, i think that was a good
lesson for you.
Jealousy's a pretty ugly thing,

22:45.498 --> 22:48.265
gumball.
>> Gumball: Yep. I get it.
>> [ Chuckles ]

22:48.267 --> 22:51.369
That's okay.
You made it, man.
>> [ Evilly ] Get your hands off

22:51.371 --> 22:57.007
him, you undead, ectoplasmic,
transparent, paranormal, spooky,
floating, French-cooking freak!

22:57.009 --> 22:57.040
>> All: Wow.
