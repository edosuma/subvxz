I WILL FORWARD THE PAPERWORK
OVER, OKAY?

40:04.269 --> 40:06.136
YES. OKAY.
VERY GOOD.

40:09.206 --> 40:11.207
THANK YOU, SERGEANT.
CAPTAIN.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.509
MM-HMM.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.110
MM.

40:14.112 --> 40:15.845
JULIO.

40:15.847 --> 40:19.082
THIS ANGER-MANAGEMENT
IS A GET-OUT-OF-JAIL-FREE CARD,

40:19.084 --> 40:21.851
AND THE COMPROMISE THAT
THE CAPTAIN HAS WORKED OUT IS --

40:21.853 --> 40:24.554
I APPRECIATE IT, CAPTAIN.
I DO.

40:24.556 --> 40:25.855
I KNOW, JULIO.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.258
BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH IT.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.960
OTHERWISE, THIS DEAL
FALLS COMPLETELY APART.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.396
DON'T WORRY, MA'AM.
I'M READY.

40:33.398 --> 40:34.864
IN FACT, I'M GONNA NEED

40:34.866 --> 40:36.833
ALL THE ANGER-MANAGEMENT HELP
I CAN FIND.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.337
EXCUSE ME.
[ BREATHES DEEPLY ]

40:48.913 --> 40:51.147
MOM, I'M HOME.

40:52.917 --> 40:55.552
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.954
WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO MOVE HOME,

40:57.956 --> 41:00.824
THE LEAST I CAN DO
IS DRESS MY BEST.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.759
[ CHUCKLES ]
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT

41:02.761 --> 41:05.161
YOU'RE GONNA BE LIVING
IN YOUR OLD ROOM AGAIN.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.162
[ CHUCKLES ]

41:06.164 --> 41:07.430
IT'LL BE DIFFERENT
NOW.

41:07.432 --> 41:08.998
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN BED.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.501
AND MAYBE WHEN I GET BETTER,
YOU STAY.

41:11.503 --> 41:13.770
DON'T UNPACK NOW.
COME INTO THE DEN.

41:13.772 --> 41:16.172
MY SHOW
IS ABOUT TO GO ON.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.341
AND MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE US
SOME SANDWICHES.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.944
AND, JULIO,
GET ME SOME SOCKS.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.745
MY FEET ARE FREEZING.

41:22.747 --> 41:25.081
OH, AND I CAN'T FIND
THE REMOTE CONTROL ANYWHERE.

41:25.083 --> 41:27.417
HAIL MARY, FULL OF GRACE,
OUR LORD IS WITH THEE.

41:27.419 --> 41:28.985
I KNOW
IT WAS HERE SOMEWHERE.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.521
BLESSED ART THOU AMONG WOMEN,

41:31.523 --> 41:33.990
AND BLESSED
IS THE FRUIT OF THY WOMB, JESUS.

41:33.992 --> 41:34.723
HOLY MARY, MOTHER OF GOD...
