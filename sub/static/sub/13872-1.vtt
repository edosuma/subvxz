00:04.904 --> 00:06.337
Gentlemen!

00:06.406 --> 00:10.900
I have genetically spliced
the double helix of a fried pork chop...

00:11.244 --> 00:14.680
with that of my roommate, Randall!

00:16.282 --> 00:20.082
Hell yes, whoa! Come here, Randall...

00:20.153 --> 00:24.089
and pay your half of the utilities!

01:09.235 --> 01:11.863
Meatwad, your bunny rabbit showed up!

01:11.938 --> 01:15.635
- All right! Where is it?
- It's a long bunny.

01:15.708 --> 01:18.074
Sure is. Come on, bring him in here.

01:18.144 --> 01:20.840
Come on, hurry up! I ain't got all day.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.780
No. I'm putting it back outside now.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.977
Because you think I'm some kind of slave.

01:26.052 --> 01:29.647
Please, you can bring the bunny rabbit
in here now. I need it.

01:29.722 --> 01:32.156
Then you get it! It's your snake.

01:32.292 --> 01:33.452
My snake?

01:33.526 --> 01:35.517
- I thought you got me a rabbit.
- Rabbit.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.257
Well, maybe you should just open it up...

01:38.331 --> 01:42.199
before you go flying off the handle judging
things you don't know anything about.

01:42.268 --> 01:45.567
- This ain't no damn bunny rabbit!
- What do you know? It's a snake!

01:45.638 --> 01:49.472
I wanted a bunny rabbit.
I was gonna name it Nathan.

01:49.709 --> 01:53.145
That's Latin for "warm," by the way.
Nathan Scott Phillips.

01:53.213 --> 01:57.445
Hey, look. Turn that frown upside down.
You can still have a bunny rabbit.

01:57.517 --> 02:00.042
- Really?
- With a little imagination, of course.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.179
- Oh, boy!
- Look what we have here.

02:02.255 --> 02:05.554
Pipe cleaners, a stapler,
and a pound of human hair.

02:05.625 --> 02:09.755
I can make some fur, shape some ears
for him, and staple it all to his head.

02:09.829 --> 02:14.095
Then you'll be able to have your very own
long bunny rabbit that you designed.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.067
It's your chance to play God!

02:16.136 --> 02:19.230
Hold still, Nathan. This will only hurt once.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.503
But damn will it hurt!

02:24.277 --> 02:25.938
He's kissing you!

02:26.012 --> 02:29.004
- He's thanking you for the gift of life.
- Really?

02:29.716 --> 02:31.911
That's a deep kiss, too, like the Europeans.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.818
The French have to unhinge their jaw
to show love.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.287
Kind of feeling numb here.

02:36.356 --> 02:40.087
Is it supposed to really slow your
breathing down like I'm kind of feeling?

02:40.160 --> 02:43.493
Well, that's emotion
overtaking your nervous system.

02:43.563 --> 02:48.000
Well, come on, Nathan Scott Phillips.
That's your name now.

02:48.067 --> 02:50.729
- Did the bunny arrive yet?
- What bunny?

02:51.304 --> 02:52.965
Yeah, that got here, all right.

02:53.039 --> 02:56.236
And you know what,
he has been very irresponsible with it.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.368
- And it came in that box?
- I don't know.

02:58.444 --> 03:01.504
- What is that over there?
- I don't know!

03:01.581 --> 03:03.879
You're the one with the computer.
Look it up.

03:03.950 --> 03:07.181
It's going all the way back
to Meatwad's room. Oh, my God!

03:07.253 --> 03:10.086
Where is Meatwad?
There he is. I found him.

03:10.156 --> 03:12.147
- Where?
- Frylock, look.

03:12.225 --> 03:15.388
Made a nice little garden, from the inside.

03:15.461 --> 03:18.589
Oh, my God, Frylock!
You know what needs to be done.

03:18.665 --> 03:20.758
Just let it alone until he dissolves.

03:20.833 --> 03:24.030
Help me get the tail in here
so we can seal this room off forever.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.264
Shake, get back. I'll have to blow it open.

03:26.339 --> 03:29.775
Don't blow him open. This is
Nathan Scott Phillips. He's my best friend.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.707
Stand back, Meatwad. Cover your ears.

03:31.778 --> 03:34.474
You gonna save him?
Look, a snake's gotta eat.

03:34.547 --> 03:38.608
If you kill Nathan,
I will hate you for the rest of my days.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.745
Meatwad, you don't mean that.
You know you don't mean that.

03:41.821 --> 03:43.186
Yeah, I do.

03:48.127 --> 03:50.186
- I can't do it.
- That's right, you can't.

03:50.263 --> 03:53.391
- Over here. For the camera, please.
- There's gotta be another way.

03:53.466 --> 03:54.865
- Tilt your head up.
- I know.

03:54.934 --> 03:57.334
- Head up!
- We'll make the snake throw Meatwad up.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.870
I have an idea.

03:58.938 --> 04:03.068
Let's just feed him some of that crap
you made us eat for Thanksgiving.

04:03.142 --> 04:06.373
You know, I threw up for three days,
it was so disgusting.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.070
"Pukesgiving! "

04:09.716 --> 04:11.183
Damn it, he's not eating it.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.515
Of course he's not eating it. It's gelled fat.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.610
I liked it.

04:14.687 --> 04:17.952
I said that at Thanksgiving,
and here we are again.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.116
Here's what you do.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.858
Hey, Snakie! Spring break!

04:23.062 --> 04:24.723
You drunk yet, snake?

04:24.797 --> 04:27.493
Yeah, you like that vodka going in,
don't you?

04:27.567 --> 04:31.128
- We'll see how you like it coming out!
- I think he's just passed out.

04:31.204 --> 04:35.334
- Meatwad, can you hear me?
- You give me another beer! I'm 21!

04:35.408 --> 04:36.568
Great! He's drunk.

04:36.643 --> 04:40.670
I'm not drunk. You're the drunk one.
You wanna do something about it?

04:40.747 --> 04:43.238
Yeah, I'll do something about it.
How about that?

04:43.316 --> 04:45.147
- You like that?
- Do that to my face!

04:45.218 --> 04:46.708
What, you scared?

04:46.786 --> 04:48.253
He did it again.

04:51.891 --> 04:54.826
This is stupid.
Let's just kick him out of here.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.624
What? What are you looking at?

04:59.198 --> 05:01.894
God, it smells like a brewery in here!

05:01.968 --> 05:05.369
- Why do you keep shouting, stupid?
- Frylock, blow his head off!

05:05.438 --> 05:09.841
Do not kill him! He's a friend of mine.
Or you'll have to deal with me.

05:09.909 --> 05:11.536
Will you shut up, you drunk?

05:11.611 --> 05:15.138
What, you just decide that I'm drunk?
You can't decide.

05:15.214 --> 05:17.182
- Shut up!
- I make that decision.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.310
- My God.
- That decision is mine and God's.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.946
- Will you listen to yourself?
- Roger that.

05:23.022 --> 05:24.216
- Now, look.
- No.

05:24.290 --> 05:26.781
- Stop!
- If I change, I make that decision.

05:26.859 --> 05:28.486
Do not listen to Meatwad!

05:28.561 --> 05:30.722
That wasn't a decision
that was made here.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.890
Split this sucker down the middle!

05:32.965 --> 05:35.297
- All right. Hold your ears!
- Wait, don't!

05:35.368 --> 05:36.528
What's wrong?

05:36.602 --> 05:40.038
- Make sure the camera's on first.
- Yeah.

05:40.106 --> 05:42.404
- All right. How's the lights?
- Lighting's good.

05:42.475 --> 05:43.635
- Are they good?
- Yeah.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.577
- Do not touch the f-stop.
- I'm not messing with your f-stop.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.307
- You got me framed up?
- Yeah.

05:48.381 --> 05:51.077
Make sure I'm framed up
then blow her to hell.

05:57.423 --> 06:00.256
Oh, God! What have I done?

06:02.061 --> 06:04.621
- Thanks for coming, Carl.
- Yeah, but I...

06:04.997 --> 06:08.160
I can't pretend to know
what you're going through right now...

06:08.234 --> 06:10.998
but you let go, okay?

06:11.070 --> 06:12.196
Thank you.

06:12.271 --> 06:15.069
If you need anything,
you know who to look to.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.200
Someone else.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.210
If only we wouldn't have
gotten him that pet.

06:19.278 --> 06:20.768
He would have been here today.

06:20.847 --> 06:24.647
Don't beat yourself up over it.
There's nothing you can do about this.

06:25.318 --> 06:28.378
I mean, it kind of was your fault...

06:28.788 --> 06:30.688
but screw it.

06:31.357 --> 06:34.349
- They're dead and you're not.
- I appreciate it, I really do.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.190
Is this the cemetery?

06:36.562 --> 06:38.587
This is a construction site, isn't it?

06:39.799 --> 06:43.394
Yeah, thank God, man.
They've held me down for too long.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.562
Got the house all to myself.

06:45.638 --> 06:48.869
Now I can finally do
what I've always wanted to do.

06:48.941 --> 06:51.000
Hang out with the wrong crowd.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.376
So, why don't you pick up a couple
of bitches and come over tonight?

06:54.447 --> 06:56.642
Or I'll put a cigarette out
in your damn eye.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.683
You jealous? You want some?

07:04.757 --> 07:07.453
Come on, let's see what we got
in the back room here.

07:07.527 --> 07:10.052
And bring your friend. I like her.

07:12.298 --> 07:15.631
Here. It's a fruit roll-up.

07:15.802 --> 07:19.932
I was gonna make you a casserole
for your loss...

07:20.406 --> 07:22.738
- but I didn't.
- Thanks.

07:22.809 --> 07:25.277
I was gonna yell my brains out at you.

07:25.344 --> 07:29.610
But, because of your loss,
I might just gently ask...

07:29.916 --> 07:32.476
what happened last night
with all the noise?

07:34.253 --> 07:36.448
Why don't you mind
your own damn business...

07:36.522 --> 07:38.717
before I carve you up
like a Christmas goose?

07:38.791 --> 07:41.123
I'll do what I did to that snake to you, too.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.890
Try me. Lay in. You've changed.

07:46.165 --> 07:47.655
For the better?

07:51.003 --> 07:52.493
There goes the neighborhood.

08:00.279 --> 08:02.304
Man, this is over.

08:02.381 --> 08:05.714
I'm done with this crib,
and these stupid-ass dolls.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.182
"I gotta have a pet".

08:09.856 --> 08:13.383
Should have stayed with them
stupid-ass dolls, ain't that right?

08:13.826 --> 08:15.919
Now they're all gonna have to go.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.593
Who is it?

08:18.431 --> 08:19.591
Hello?

08:19.999 --> 08:22.092
Who's there? Show yourself.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.170
What? Impossible!

08:25.438 --> 08:26.996
You killed us.

08:27.073 --> 08:30.474
I told you not to do it, and you did it.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.604
- Anyways...
- No, I didn't.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.113
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.761
- Well, yeah, you did.
- No, I didn't.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.394
- Yeah, you did.
- No, I didn't.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.063
- You did.
- No, really, I didn't.

09:02.909 --> 09:05.173
- Wait, did you just say that you did?
- He did?

09:05.244 --> 09:07.838
- What, did he say that he did?
- No, I said I didn't.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.609
- 'Cause you did!
- No, I didn't!

09:09.682 --> 09:10.774
- Did, too.
- Didn't.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.317
- Did.
- No, I didn't.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.374
Yes, you did!

09:13.452 --> 09:15.852
Watch the fire.
Over there. Don't burn yourself.

09:15.922 --> 09:17.287
Thank you.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.257
- But you did.
- No, I didn't.

09:19.325 --> 09:20.792
- Yes, you did!
- No, I didn't.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.657
- You so freaking did!
- No, I didn't!

09:22.728 --> 09:24.286
- Of course you did!
- No, I did not!

09:24.363 --> 09:26.354
- Yes, you did!
- No, I didn't!

09:27.900 --> 09:30.198
- Well, yeah, you did.
- No, I didn't.

09:30.269 --> 09:31.531
- Yes, you did!
- No...

09:33.139 --> 09:34.572
- You freaking did!
- No.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.335
- Yes, you did!
- Really, I didn't.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.775
Yes, you did!

09:38.844 --> 09:41.711
- Yes, you did!
- Meatwad.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.772
Take off the headgear.

09:43.849 --> 09:47.012
You stay away from me
with your bad influence and your earring!

09:47.086 --> 09:49.145
You killed me. I ain't gonna forget that.

09:49.221 --> 09:52.782
Relax, Meatwad, it's over.
That was just a computer simulation.

09:53.292 --> 09:54.759
Wait a second.

09:54.827 --> 09:57.387
So I'm not a zombie?

09:57.463 --> 09:59.863
- Nope. No, you're not.
- But I crave brain.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.991
- Computer simulation.
- What happened next?

10:02.068 --> 10:05.003
I don't know. I rolled myself
into a corner there at the end.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.198
Still, it was pretty realistic,
don't you think?

10:07.273 --> 10:09.264
Yeah, the graphics were great.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.903
And especially the pains that I was feeling
in the back of my head...

10:12.979 --> 10:15.743
- were very realistic.
- And that was just me...

10:15.815 --> 10:18.648
jabbing you in the back of your head
with this fondue fork.

10:18.718 --> 10:21.653
- You did your job good.
- So I hope you learned your lesson.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.245
Yes, I did!

10:23.889 --> 10:25.720
I mean, oh, I did.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.388
- Wait, what was it?
- Don't you see, Meatwad?

10:29.462 --> 10:32.659
Having a pet is a large responsibility,
and the simulation program...

10:32.732 --> 10:35.633
proved you are not mature enough
to take care of a pet rabbit.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.430
Frylock, is that what you think?

10:37.503 --> 10:40.870
Well, that's what I and the computer
both know.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.070
Well, then, know this.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.870
Hey, Nathan, look! Fresh brains.

10:48.948 --> 10:52.475
Come on, lap them up
while they're still warm and thinking.

10:52.551 --> 10:53.950
Oh, God, my brain!

10:54.020 --> 10:56.454
- Turn the simulation off, please.
- God, my brain!

10:56.522 --> 10:59.855
Frylock, please.
That was a computer simulation program.

10:59.925 --> 11:04.589
And it proved to me that you don't know
what I like and what I like to do.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.825
And that is to tell you what to do.

11:06.899 --> 11:10.300
You need to listen to what I say
because I'm gonna eat your brains!
