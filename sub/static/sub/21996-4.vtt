we now turn our attention

01:14.041 --> 01:17.142
to the Champion Hill

ripped to pieces

01:39.500 --> 01:42.367
There were thousands
of casualties.

01:46.373 --> 01:49.675
What's really interesting
is that the Champion family,

01:49.677 --> 01:53.979
who originally founded this land
in the mid 1800s,

01:53.981 --> 01:58.283

03:02.783 --> 03:06.785
I want to ask you,
how much land do you own here?

03:06.787 --> 03:11.123
The family owns
567 acres of land,

03:11.125 --> 03:13.959
and it's all Civil War

What are
we dealing with here?

03:26.507 --> 03:31.009
I can give many examples
of supernatural occurrences

03:31.011 --> 03:33.445
at this very location
right here

in the background

03:40.154 --> 03:42.721
is Al Dugas, Sid's friend.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.656
Al was sitting in the same spot

03:44.658 --> 03:46.825
when he had
an awakening experience.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.895
Did you see something
with your own eyes

03:49.897 --> 03:52.064
when you were just sitting out
here on the porch one night?

03:52.066 --> 03:55.567
Yeah.
It was misty, foggy.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.436
I mean, I don't know
how to explain it,

03:57.438 --> 03:59.438
but it wasn't human form.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.141
It was just, like,
two distinct mists, you know,

04:03.143 --> 04:05.243
going up the hill
like they had a purpose.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.547
When I came off the porch,
I was looking at it,

04:08.549 --> 04:10.549
and I tried to again to see
if I could get some,

04:10.551 --> 04:11.984
you know,
get closer to them,

04:11.986 --> 04:13.785
but I couldn't ever
get closer to them.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.220
Then when I got up
to the top of the hill,

04:15.222 --> 04:18.123
they just kind of blended off
into the woods, and that was it.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.759
Do you think that
this could have been

04:20.761 --> 04:22.828
the spirits of two soldiers?

Okay, right now, we are
in pursuit of Sid.

05:24.158 --> 05:27.559

terrifying experience.

I had a blanket,

05:29.997 --> 05:33.699
cold, wet, blanket of emotion,

05:33.701 --> 05:35.934
but the emotion was rage,

05:35.936 --> 05:40.872
hate, anger, enmity,
malevolence.

05:40.874 --> 05:45.544
All this wrapped up in one,
and the hopelessness

05:45.546 --> 05:48.747
that I felt within all of that
at the same time.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.750
Do you think what you
were feeling at that time

05:51.752 --> 05:54.886
was a concentration
from what happened here?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.121
Yes.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.559
There's a lot of energy here

over to the ravines

06:06.300 --> 06:08.633

I want to cry with her.

about the bleaching bones
of the dead ribs

that were to be seen
in these ravines

06:52.913 --> 06:54.946

a rather active battlefield

06:58.218 --> 07:00.318

supernatural stuff goes.

07:00.320 --> 07:04.556
There's been many instances
of things occurring out here.

happened to be

07:06.894 --> 07:10.762

07:10.764 --> 07:12.931
You're on the battlefield
of Champion Hill.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.434
Your friend, Sid, just told me
about a terrifying encounter

07:16.436 --> 07:19.371
that is the only thing
that he has ever encountered

07:19.373 --> 07:22.908
at the same exact spot
where you had an experience.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.309
Yes, yes.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.845
Me and a friend of mine was over
out turkey hunting one day,

07:26.847 --> 07:28.246
and all of a sudden,

07:28.248 --> 07:30.315
I felt something really cold
hit this shoulder.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.951
I mean, 30, 40 degrees colder
than the air around me.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.519
It went all the way
through my body.

-Through you?
-Right.

Yeah.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.662

we discover
what could be responsible

07:45.899 --> 07:48.466
for the concentration
of experiences here.

07:48.468 --> 07:53.238

08:12.192 --> 08:15.894
by the Union soldiers
that stormed his property.

08:15.896 --> 08:19.731

and anger

08:19.733 --> 08:22.701
that was not only injected
into this ground

08:22.703 --> 08:24.202

of casualties right here

several times

during the course of the battle
in pitched combat.

they had been in battles

09:34.741 --> 09:36.808
that were bigger,
but none that were any fiercer,

11:09.352 --> 11:11.286
It is almost dark.

11:11.288 --> 11:13.021
We want to take
what light we have left.

11:13.023 --> 11:15.890
Mm-hmm.
Bill Chappell, we are
getting ready

11:15.892 --> 11:19.394
to investigate
Champion Hill battlefield.

11:19.396 --> 11:21.930
For this battlefield
investigation,

11:21.932 --> 11:24.699
what are we going to be doing
with all this equipment?

11:24.701 --> 11:27.135
What is this?

11:27.137 --> 11:28.870
I'm coming back
to the laser mics again,

11:28.872 --> 11:31.139
but this time,
instead of using red light,

11:31.141 --> 11:32.941
we're going to shoot
ultraviolet.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.542
-Instead of using one --
-Ultraviolet lasers?

11:34.544 --> 11:35.643
-Right, right.
-Isn't that dangerous?

11:35.645 --> 11:37.212
And instead of one laser --
It is.

11:37.214 --> 11:40.248
ZAK: Looking directly into
this powerful U.V. laser

11:40.250 --> 11:43.551
could burn your retina
and even cause blindness.

11:43.553 --> 11:45.053
Okay, explain to me
real quick...
Okay.

11:45.055 --> 11:47.755
...what this is, because
we gotta go do a signal

11:47.757 --> 11:49.557
to the spirits
of the battlefield after this,

11:49.559 --> 11:50.692
and you're going to witness
this with us.

11:50.694 --> 11:52.126
-Perfect.
-So?

11:52.128 --> 11:53.895
When we used to do this in
the past, we had a single lens,

11:53.897 --> 11:55.096
single element.

11:55.098 --> 11:57.999
This new version has
seven elements inside,

11:58.001 --> 12:00.502
and we use a refracting
crystal lens on top,

12:00.504 --> 12:02.971
so that we can shoot to it
from any angle.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.038
-I like that.
-It makes setting up...

12:04.040 --> 12:05.240
-You don't have line it up.
-Right.

12:05.242 --> 12:08.343
What does, ultimately,
this laser have to do

12:08.345 --> 12:10.111
with getting evidence
of ghosts?

12:10.113 --> 12:12.580
As the air moves
across these lasers,

12:12.582 --> 12:14.549
if there's anything
spoken into them,

12:14.551 --> 12:16.184
it'll cause the laser
to modulate.

12:16.186 --> 12:17.485
Okay.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.020
In other words, if you were
to talk by the laser,

12:19.022 --> 12:22.524
and that modulation has actually
moved the laser beams slightly,

12:22.526 --> 12:24.759
and the element detects
the movement of the laser.

12:24.761 --> 12:25.760
So we can hear voices
through a speaker?

12:25.762 --> 12:27.195
We can hear voices
through it,

12:27.197 --> 12:29.964
and we're capturing
in real time the audio track.

12:29.966 --> 12:33.001
So we need to head
right over here because we have

12:33.003 --> 12:34.903
something ceremonial
that we're going to do

12:34.905 --> 12:37.205
to let the spirits
of the battlefield know

12:37.207 --> 12:39.274
that we are ready.
Okay.

12:43.914 --> 12:46.414
that he's going to
let us fire ourselves.

12:46.416 --> 12:48.883
We hope the shock waves
of these blasts

12:48.885 --> 12:51.286
reignite the residual energy,

12:51.288 --> 12:53.855
waking the spirits
so we can make contact

12:53.857 --> 12:56.758
and hopefully free
their lost souls.

14:02.359 --> 14:05.693
This is a massive,
tactical-style investigation,

14:05.695 --> 14:09.430
covering over 500 acres
of blood-soaked Earth.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.000
As we prepare our gear
and start to head out,

14:12.002 --> 14:14.202

fills us

14:14.204 --> 14:15.970
with nervous anticipation

14:15.972 --> 14:18.406
for what this adventure
may bring.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.279
We have about a 2-mile drive

14:25.281 --> 14:27.815
until we get to the battlefield
where we'll be investigating,

14:27.817 --> 14:30.184
but right now we got to go
through the forest,

14:30.186 --> 14:32.153
over the river,
down in the woods,

14:32.155 --> 14:34.656

we're going.

It's straight to

14:39.596 --> 14:43.731
whatever evil force terrified
Sid Champion V...

14:43.733 --> 14:47.368
It was like having a wet blanket
wrapped around me,

14:47.370 --> 14:48.770

15:05.221 --> 15:07.889
and miles away
from any major town,

15:07.891 --> 15:09.991
and that makes
this investigation

15:09.993 --> 15:11.259
of this battlefield

15:11.261 --> 15:15.296
that much more completely
awesome yet terrifying.

to conduct

the storm picks up again,

to lighten up again.

Bill, is the ultraviolet

16:40.383 --> 16:42.517
Yeah. We can see it hitting
the dome right now.

16:42.519 --> 16:44.886
Okay. The reason why I'm not
turning that way

16:44.888 --> 16:48.089
because I do not want
to have this laser beam

16:48.091 --> 16:49.490

17:36.831 --> 17:38.330
is the beam
hitting the detector,

hearing the wind.
