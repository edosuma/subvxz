WEBVTT

00:07.040 --> 00:08.800
I won't drag you all into this.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.640
No one is going to the police.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.720
No one is going to turn herself in.
No one!

00:12.800 --> 00:15.960
No, it's my fault.
I'm going to call...

00:16.040 --> 00:17.520
Ángeles! Ángeles!

00:19.080 --> 00:22.040
Prison is worse than being dead.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.400
I know.

00:31.080 --> 00:35.280
They treated me like an animal
for a robbery I didn't commit.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.960
Imagine what they'd do to you for this.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.520
Going to jail will ruin your lives...

00:41.600 --> 00:43.560
like it ruined mine.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.000
What we have to do...

00:51.800 --> 00:55.080
is get rid of the body
without anyone finding out,

00:56.200 --> 00:57.480
then forget what happened.

00:57.560 --> 01:00.520
We'll never talk about this again.
None of us.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.800
If the four of us work together,
everything will be fine.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.880
When I had just arrived in Madrid,
at that damn train station,

01:13.960 --> 01:16.080
I was accused of a crime I didn't commit.

01:16.560 --> 01:19.000
Ten years later, the story was different.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.640
This time, the crime was real.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.160
I don't know if Mario
deserved to die like that or not.

01:31.360 --> 01:35.320
I don't know if things
could've gone differently that night.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.960
We'll never know now.

01:40.080 --> 01:44.000
But I do know that none of us who were
there on that rooftop that night

01:44.080 --> 01:46.240
deserve to be judged
for protecting ourselves.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.080
Far from the city,
there's an area along the river,

01:53.160 --> 01:56.120
where we can... get rid of him.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.480
-Where did you leave the car, Ángeles?
-The car?

02:04.520 --> 02:06.440
Didn't you drive to the party?

02:07.160 --> 02:09.680
We need it to move him.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.640
Yes, but the keys are in his pocket.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.000
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

04:05.880 --> 04:07.160
You're unbelievable.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.280
No shame whatsoever.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.880
-Carlos...
-What?

04:14.120 --> 04:16.880
How dare you show up here
after all that's happened?

04:16.959 --> 04:19.760
I'm here to make things right with you.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.400
Lidia has asked me to help her
develop a project to compete with you,

04:27.440 --> 04:29.240
and I've come to offer you my help.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.400
So now you care about me?

04:33.480 --> 04:35.640
Why didn't you tell me
that Lidia was Alba?

04:36.120 --> 04:37.720
-You're a traitor!
-You're wrong.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.440
I knew you loved her.
I didn't want to ruin it.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.120
How would you have felt,

04:42.200 --> 04:44.760
knowing she was the woman
I'd dreamed of all my life?

04:44.840 --> 04:46.920
Carlos, you're my brother.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.280
Let me prove
I've always been on your side.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.320
CHAPTER 10: PACT

04:52.400 --> 04:53.320
Okay.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.000
If you accept my conditions.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.640
What was--

05:17.840 --> 05:18.880
What was that?

05:19.840 --> 05:22.840
-Did you hear it?
-It must have been a rat. No one's here.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.320
What if we were seen
putting the body in the car?

05:26.400 --> 05:29.800
No one knows anything.
No one saw anything. Just us.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.360
What if the police start asking questions,
huh?

05:32.440 --> 05:34.160
It's best if we go and confess...

05:34.240 --> 05:37.440
No! No! It's already been decided.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.480
But it was a mistake. We can explain...

05:39.560 --> 05:41.240
There's no mistake!

05:41.320 --> 05:45.400
The only mistake is that
you've all been caught up in this with me.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.760
But his death wasn't an accident.
It was divine justice.

05:49.840 --> 05:50.960
It wasn't a mistake.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.640
How can you say that?

05:53.320 --> 05:57.200
Shut up! You have no idea
what my life was like.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.160
My life with that man was a living hell.

05:59.240 --> 06:04.240
I'm not sorry I killed him. I'm not.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.520
I have to think about my daughter.
We'll do what Lidia said.

06:08.600 --> 06:12.880
If the police find out, I'll explain.
I'll turn myself in.

06:14.480 --> 06:18.800
It's best not to think about something
that hasn't happened yet. Let's calm down.

06:18.880 --> 06:22.080
We'll find a good alibi for you.
Let's go back to the car.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.920
I want to know about her project.
What she's planning, when, how...

06:35.000 --> 06:37.680
If she trusts you,
she'll tell you everything.

06:37.760 --> 06:41.040
What does her project matter?
I'll help you develop a better one.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.800
Uribe has faith in it, and I can't risk
being left out of the company.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.000
-I've got a lot at stake.
-In that case, I have a condition, too.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.000
-I want to see Elisa.
-No.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.760
-You've hurt her enough already.
-That's precisely why.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.560
If I come back,
she has to know everything.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.400
I don't want her
to distrust my relationship with Lidia.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.840
Isn't it a bit late
to start worrying about her?

07:03.400 --> 07:05.200
I've suffered a lot, too.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.880
I needed space,
and now I see things clearly.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.320
Elisa was hospitalized after you left.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.480
The official story's that she has vertigo,
but she's there because of you.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.400
After you left, she wouldn't eat,
talk, or leave her room.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.440
Why didn't you tell me?

07:27.200 --> 07:29.320
She's coming home tomorrow for a visit.

07:29.800 --> 07:33.520
Her doctor says she's improving,
but I won't let you upset her again.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.000
Carlos, I just want to fix things.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.880
Let me go with you to pick her up.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.680
If she doesn't want to see me,
I'll never see her again.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.560
Very well. She can decide.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.960
Ángeles, first thing tomorrow,
get on a bus

07:48.040 --> 07:50.920
and go with Sofía
to your mother's house in the village.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.840
If anyone asks,
say that your mother isn't well.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.200
It isn't serious,
but you have to help her out.

07:58.520 --> 08:03.240
I left Sofía with my neighbor.
I said I'd pick her up at 12:00.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.960
-Should I get her sooner?
-No.

08:06.640 --> 08:09.920
It's best to act
as if nothing has happened.

08:11.640 --> 08:16.200
What about work? What do we do
when they notice his absence?

08:16.280 --> 08:19.360
It'll take them a few days
to call the authorities.

08:19.440 --> 08:22.320
But the police will go to see you.
You have to be prepared.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.680
Say that you went to see your mother,

08:24.920 --> 08:28.240
and that Mario was going to pick you up,
but he never showed up.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.080
And what do we do?

08:34.919 --> 08:37.120
All we have to do is keep quiet.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.120
We can't tell anyone about this.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.680
I'll drop you off,
and I'll take care of the car.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.320
I went to the party, but you'd left.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.440
Can you hold me?

10:31.600 --> 10:32.760
Thank you.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.360
For what?

10:37.760 --> 10:40.760
For being here,
for turning up unexpectedly,

10:40.840 --> 10:43.720
for being so good to me
despite all that I did to you.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.880
-After ruining your life.
-Yes.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.400
I blame myself every day for that.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.560
Lately, I wonder what would
have happened if I'd gone with you,

10:58.880 --> 11:01.040
if Carlos hadn't come into my life.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.520
Lidia, I made mistakes, too.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.640
You loved me
more than anyone else...

11:06.160 --> 11:08.120
and I didn't realize it at the time.

11:16.880 --> 11:20.200
I don't know what Carlos did to you
or what happened to you tonight,

11:20.280 --> 11:22.800
but I know you well enough
to know that it's too soon.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.480
You're hurt, confused...

11:27.560 --> 11:30.000
and this isn't what you need now.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.320
It will only complicate things more.

11:37.040 --> 11:41.920
I've come back because
I want to get into the company again.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.720
We're going to work together.
I'll help you win.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.360
We'll do it together.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.160
Okay?

11:55.960 --> 11:57.000
I have to go.

12:07.880 --> 12:08.760
Francisco.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.200
Wait.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.400
These are the project documents.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.920
Take a look at them
and tell me what you think.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.520
-Good night.
-Good night.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.600
-Marga, you scared me!
-Lidia...

12:47.680 --> 12:51.160
-What are you doing here?
-I'm sorry, I couldn't sleep...

12:52.120 --> 12:55.480
I keep going over everything.
I didn't know you'd been in prison.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.320
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.440
I've never met anyone
who's been in prison.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.560
I can't imagine
what you must have been through.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.960
The worst thing isn't being there,

13:10.360 --> 13:12.320
it's not seeing a way out.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.640
What we have to do now
is move forward.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.120
Think about Pablo.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.400
About your grandmother.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.480
I don't know if I can bear it.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.760
I'm scared.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.320
Marga, you're much stronger
than you think.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.480
I don't know.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.280
And you have a wonderful life
ahead of you.

13:45.320 --> 13:49.320
Don't throw it away over something
that has nothing to do with you.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.840
-I'm in this, too, Lidia.
-Then trust me.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.560
And go to sleep.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.000
It's been a very long day.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.360
Can I stay here for a while?

14:08.720 --> 14:09.880
Of course.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.720
Thank you.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.120
What on earth is going on?

14:33.200 --> 14:35.640
-Did you steal something--
-We didn't steal anything.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.360
I saw you leaving in a car.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.120
I know you're hiding something.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.560
My God. What is that?

14:44.400 --> 14:45.920
What have you done?

14:48.840 --> 14:50.280
What happened?

14:55.760 --> 14:57.680
He was going to strangle her.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.920
He hit his head when he fell.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.600
He was going to kill her.
It was him or Ángeles.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.160
-Lidia said so. She said so.
-Carlota...

15:06.240 --> 15:09.200
We can't go to prison.
We didn't do anything.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.360
-It was an accident.
-What?

15:11.440 --> 15:13.840
We killed Mario! Mario is dead!

15:17.040 --> 15:20.520
-Tell me that isn't true.
-Sara, it was an accident.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.520
We didn't mean to.
You have to believe me, please.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.400
Carlos!

16:38.000 --> 16:40.120
-You look wonderful.
-Thank you.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.480
Thank you, Sister.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.800
I missed that smile. It's finally back.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.280
Because I finally feel better.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.600
Knowing I'm getting out of here,
even for a few days,

16:54.680 --> 16:56.720
is already a good reason to smile.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.160
Mother didn't come?

17:00.000 --> 17:03.640
Was she afraid someone from the country
club would see her near a hospital?

17:03.720 --> 17:05.160
No, don't be like that.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.560
She's getting the house ready
to welcome you back.

17:07.640 --> 17:10.880
-She wants everything to be perfect.
-I feel sorry for Ubalda.

17:10.960 --> 17:14.120
She must've had to change the sheets
on my bed so many times.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.400
I've got something to tell you.

17:24.359 --> 17:25.920
Mother didn't come...

17:28.000 --> 17:29.560
but I've brought someone with me.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.800
He's very sorry,

17:35.640 --> 17:38.240
and he's come back
to help get rid of Lidia.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.440
That remains to be seen.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.280
Elisa, I...

17:47.600 --> 17:50.040
I've been dreaming about doing that
for six months,

17:50.120 --> 17:52.440
and I have to admit it was worth the wait.

17:54.360 --> 17:56.960
I'm going to request a marriage annulment.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.480
If you've really come back
with good intentions,

17:59.560 --> 18:01.520
you'll have no problem in cooperating.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.200
-Let's take--
-No, forget it.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.000
You were the star of my life.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.200
Now it's my turn to shine.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.120
I'll see you at home.

18:19.720 --> 18:20.560
Sara.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.200
I'm sorry.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.920
I shouldn't have said anything.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.520
The last thing I want
is to get you involved.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.360
But, Carlota,
why didn't you call the police?

18:34.040 --> 18:35.000
And where is the...

18:35.080 --> 18:36.440
Are you going to turn us in?

18:37.160 --> 18:39.360
No, Carlota,
I'd never do anything like that.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.160
You saved me once, remember?

18:42.240 --> 18:45.440
And I love you. I love you so much
that I don't know...

18:45.520 --> 18:48.760
Sara, I swear to God it was an accident.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.240
It wasn't on purpose,
and it happened so fast...

18:52.080 --> 18:53.600
I can't lose you.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.880
I'll always be by your side,
you hear me?

18:55.960 --> 18:57.280
Whatever happens.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.480
It's all just as you left it.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.080
It's...

19:15.880 --> 19:18.880
unbelievable the number of things that...

19:20.400 --> 19:22.960
I used to think were essential
and that now...

19:24.800 --> 19:26.080
aren't.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.480
I know how difficult it must have been,

19:30.160 --> 19:32.080
but it was for your own good.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.760
Of course it was, Mother.

19:35.480 --> 19:36.760
Don't worry.

19:41.600 --> 19:45.040
Now I want to do something meaningful.
I want to work at the company.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.640
-You what?
-I want to help run the company.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.520
I'd like nothing better, my dear,

19:53.600 --> 19:56.080
but don't rush things.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.440
You need to rest.
You haven't even been discharged yet.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.400
But I will be, Mother.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.360
I want to help my family,
work side by side with you.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.680
Do you think I wouldn't do a good job?

20:08.800 --> 20:11.160
I don't think anyone could do it better.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.120
You rest now. I'll speak to Uribe.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.360
I'm sure he'll be as enthusiastic
about the idea as I am.

20:19.640 --> 20:23.760
Where were you, Carlos?
Why did you leave Elisa on her own?

20:25.440 --> 20:28.480
Elisa has asked Francisco
for a marriage annulment.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.120
What?

20:31.120 --> 20:33.480
Francisco is going to help me
destroy Lidia,

20:33.560 --> 20:36.880
and he wanted to meet Elisa beforehand
to explain it to her.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.000
I knew it.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.680
I know my daughter better than anyone.

20:44.360 --> 20:49.000
That smile, feigning serenity.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.360
This time she won't catch me off guard
when she explodes.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.240
-We have to move quickly.
-What do you mean?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.600
We have to have her committed.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.880
Don't be hasty. She looks much better.

21:02.960 --> 21:06.520
Don't believe that.
Your sister is a time bomb.

21:06.600 --> 21:10.320
Now that your father isn't here,
there are important decisions to be made,

21:10.400 --> 21:12.680
and she should have
neither voice, nor vote.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.920
What should I tell Francisco
about the annulment?

21:16.000 --> 21:19.560
We want Elisa to be happy
until we have her committed.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.760
Thank you very much, Mr. Santos.
You did what you had to do.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.120
I didn't know you were meeting
with Mr. Uribe.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.400
Yes, yes. I had no choice,
after what happened.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.760
I couldn't stay silent.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.720
Is something wrong?

21:38.800 --> 21:41.160
The company has been robbed...

21:41.840 --> 21:43.200
by one of the employees.

21:43.280 --> 21:46.040
One of the chief technicians.
Mario something...

21:46.120 --> 21:47.040
Mario Pérez.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.920
-Yes, what's wrong? Do you know him?
-No...

21:52.520 --> 21:55.600
Well, yes, a little, through Ángeles.
She's his wife.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.720
She worked with me as an operator.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.400
I'm sorry about the unpleasant situation,

22:01.480 --> 22:04.720
but I need you to gather
all the employees in the hall.

22:04.800 --> 22:09.720
Sir, with all due respect,
I think you're being too hasty.

22:10.240 --> 22:14.920
The workers will just get nervous,
and Mario might still show up.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.120
Maybe this is only a misunderstanding.

22:17.400 --> 22:21.200
Thank you for the advice,
but I can't just stand idly by.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.160
It's not just about the robbery.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.280
It's to send a message to the employees.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.360
Whoever steals from this company
will pay for it with jail time.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.920
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.880
Your attention!

22:40.960 --> 22:44.480
I've just been informed of a very
unpleasant incident in this company.

22:44.560 --> 22:48.480
I believe you should be
informed immediately.

22:48.560 --> 22:54.400
It concerns Mario Pérez,
chief technician in this company.

22:54.480 --> 22:57.960
He's been accused of the theft
of 5,000 pesetas.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.960
The matter will be put
in the hands of the police,

23:01.040 --> 23:04.000
but right now,
I wish to inform everyone

23:04.080 --> 23:06.800
that I'll be absolutely unforgiving
with this kind of crime.

23:07.400 --> 23:12.480
Since my arrival, my main concern has been
ensuring the improvement

23:12.560 --> 23:15.400
of all employees' salaries
and labor conditions.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.000
I won't allow myself to be treated
like this in return.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.760
I'd appreciate
your collaboration in this case

23:21.840 --> 23:25.320
and any information you can give us
about his whereabouts,

23:25.400 --> 23:27.840
since he hasn't come to work today.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.560
Believe me, you will be rewarded.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.120
Thank you very much.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.840
What have you done?

23:44.920 --> 23:47.080
Why did you report Mario?

23:47.160 --> 23:49.240
Didn't we say
I'd help you count the money?

23:49.320 --> 23:50.960
Yes, we did, but...

23:51.400 --> 23:56.320
last night, when I went back to the party,
I couldn't find you. Where were you?

24:01.120 --> 24:03.560
It must've been late.
I'd already gone to bed.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.800
Marga, are you lying to me?

24:08.200 --> 24:11.240
I went to the boarding house.
Your friend said you hadn't returned.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.800
All right.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.840
The thing is...

24:22.560 --> 24:24.160
I got drunk with the girls.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.560
Honey, it was New Year's Eve.
So what if you had a drink--

24:28.640 --> 24:30.520
Yes, but I had lots. One after another...

24:30.600 --> 24:33.120
and I lost the handkerchief you bought me.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.400
-The one I gave you for your birthday?
-Yes.

24:35.480 --> 24:39.840
Yes, I looked everywhere.
That's what took me so long.

24:40.920 --> 24:43.920
I think I put it
on the statue of Cibeles--

24:44.000 --> 24:47.760
It doesn't matter. It's just
a handkerchief. Don't worry about it.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.400
No, it's not the handkerchief.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.280
Why didn't you wait for me?

24:57.880 --> 25:00.040
Now that man's going to call the police!

25:00.120 --> 25:01.680
It's out of my hands.

25:01.760 --> 25:05.200
I had to report a theft,
which is hard to do to a coworker.

25:05.280 --> 25:08.080
-It's going to be a mess.
-It'll be what it has to be.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.680
It sounds like Mario was your boyfriend,
not me.

25:10.760 --> 25:14.000
Maybe you think I reported him
because I took the money.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.920
I told you to wait for me.
That's what I said.

25:22.440 --> 25:23.720
But, Marga...

25:32.040 --> 25:35.160
-Lidia. How are you?
-Fine.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.040
I'm sorry about yesterday.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.680
I was very sensitive and vulnerable.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.000
-I know you're married--
-Don't apologize.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.520
I thought we'd arranged
to meet to do some work.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.440
There was a theft at the company.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.640
They think it was Mario,
the chief technician.

25:59.720 --> 26:03.040
I have to go speak to his wife.
I'll see you later.

26:03.120 --> 26:07.160
Of course, don't worry. I'll try to make
as much progress as I can.

26:07.240 --> 26:08.680
How long do you need?

26:11.880 --> 26:15.080
A couple of hours.
I'll meet you back at the office.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.720
-Fourth floor.
-I'll be there.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.400
POLICE REPORT

26:27.920 --> 26:31.200
Cuevas, there's been a theft
at the Telephone Company.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.080
Stop what you're doing and get on it.

26:33.160 --> 26:36.080
You're joking, right? I'm about
to catch the Lavapiés killer.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.360
-I almost have him.
-Didn't you hear me?

26:38.880 --> 26:41.600
This man has killed three women
and he's still on the loose.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.760
-Cuevas!
-I've been on this case for months.

26:43.840 --> 26:46.840
You'd let this bastard get away
because of some petty theft?

26:47.560 --> 26:49.400
It isn't petty theft.

26:49.480 --> 26:53.240
One of the workers has swiped
5,000 pesetas from the company.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.200
A Mario Pérez.
He didn't turn up for work today.

26:56.280 --> 27:00.320
Go to his house, sort this out,
and maybe you'll still catch the murderer.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.160
What are you looking at?

27:11.240 --> 27:14.760
You know where I am if you need me.
She slept like an angel.

27:14.840 --> 27:17.000
Really? Great. Thanks.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.400
What are you doing here?

27:22.640 --> 27:24.520
You have to leave! Now!

27:29.200 --> 27:33.080
Sofía, will you find your favorite doll
and show it to me?

27:37.480 --> 27:38.320
What?

27:38.400 --> 27:41.400
Mario was accused of stealing money
from the company.

27:41.960 --> 27:42.880
What?

27:42.960 --> 27:46.360
Supposedly, Mario stole 5,000 pesetas
from the company,

27:46.440 --> 27:48.240
and Mr. Uribe has called the police.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.240
They're bound to be coming here.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.480
Have you got everything?

27:58.160 --> 28:00.880
Yes. I think so.

28:06.400 --> 28:07.840
Here, take this, please.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.200
Ángeles,
you're supposed to be a deserted wife.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.960
No one will believe you're having
a hard time if you look...

28:15.800 --> 28:16.920
What?

28:18.520 --> 28:22.320
Lidia, I've spent my whole life
doing what I was supposed to do.

28:22.520 --> 28:26.000
I kept my husband happy.
I kept everyone happy.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.080
But that's over.

28:29.880 --> 28:33.840
I'm a free woman now,
and I'll dress as I please.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.200
-What's wrong?
-Where are we going?

28:40.280 --> 28:42.400
To see Grandma and Grandpa.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.160
Isn't Papa coming?

28:46.440 --> 28:50.440
Papa... Papa will come in a few days.

28:52.600 --> 28:53.640
Come on.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.320
We have to go.

29:14.400 --> 29:15.480
All ready?

29:20.680 --> 29:21.720
Good day.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.800
I'm Inspector Cuevas.
I'm looking for Mario Pérez.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.320
Is either of you his wife, Ángeles Vidal?

29:27.400 --> 29:28.480
Yes, that's me.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.080
-And you are...
-Lidia Aguilar.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.560
-A friend of Ángeles.
-A pleasure.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.640
I've come at a bad time. Are you leaving?

29:38.240 --> 29:41.320
-Yes, we were going to--
-To see Grandma and Grandpa.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.400
-And your Papa?
-He isn't here.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.520
-Where is he?
-I don't know...

29:45.800 --> 29:47.600
Where he is right now, I mean.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.200
May I come in?

29:51.000 --> 29:52.720
I'd like to ask you some questions.

29:52.800 --> 29:56.200
-We're late. They'll miss the bus.
-They can take the next one.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.480
It's important.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.440
We believe your husband's involved
in the theft at the Telephone Company.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.640
That can't be.
My husband is an honest man.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.600
Right. When did you last see him?

30:08.760 --> 30:12.240
Last night, at the company's
New Year auction.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.480
Yesterday?

30:14.440 --> 30:18.200
You didn't come back together?
Didn't he sleep here last night?

30:20.360 --> 30:24.520
Well, this is a little embarrassing...

30:25.800 --> 30:28.560
Relax. Everything we discuss
will stay between us.

30:29.360 --> 30:34.040
We argued and...
he didn't come home last night.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.160
Do you know where he went?

30:44.560 --> 30:45.960
Did he run off with the money?

30:46.040 --> 30:50.280
I didn't know my husband ran off,
much less that he'd stolen anything.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.440
We don't have any money problems.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.400
I understand.

30:55.920 --> 30:59.520
Do you have a recent photo of him?
I'll need it for my investigation.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.280
I'd have to look.

31:09.840 --> 31:13.800
-We don't take many photos.
-Don't worry. I can get one another time.

31:15.680 --> 31:18.080
Well, that's everything.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.320
For now, of course.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.480
Thank you for your help.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.680
One more thing.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.840
I know I said you could take the next bus,

31:38.920 --> 31:41.840
but you shouldn't leave
until we have news of your husband.

31:41.920 --> 31:45.640
-But her mother needs her. She's sick.
-I'm sorry,

31:45.720 --> 31:48.960
but we need to know
if he comes home or contacts you.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.560
If this isn't how he normally behaves,
we'll find out what's going on.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.480
Inspector...

31:55.760 --> 31:57.600
Please tell me everything you find out.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.400
-I'm very worried.
-I won't lie to you.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.840
Mr. Uribe has made this a top priority.
We'll see how it ends.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.760
If they think he's run off
with the money...

32:24.120 --> 32:26.080
we'll give them reason to believe it.

32:28.440 --> 32:29.800
This isn't going to work.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.400
If they find some of Mario's clothes
on the train,

32:32.480 --> 32:34.120
no one will doubt he was there.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.600
-Forget it, Lidia. I'll take care of it.
-Hold on, Marga.

32:37.680 --> 32:40.880
No. You'll go to Cuevas with other proof
Mario was at the station.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.640
Leave it to me. I know how to do this
without running any risk.

32:44.720 --> 32:48.080
Bring me some of his clothes
and I'll set it up.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.600
All right. I'll bring a suitcase.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.840
We'll meet in an hour at the main door.

32:52.920 --> 32:53.920
Perfect.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.160
Don't you think all this is snowballing?

32:57.240 --> 32:59.680
-Trust me. It'll be fine.
-What are you going to do?

33:22.520 --> 33:23.840
Hello.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.240
-Hello.
-Listen, one thing.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.440
Maybe the handkerchief had legs

33:29.520 --> 33:32.400
and walked from Cibeles,
or you're lying to me.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.840
What are you talking about?

33:34.920 --> 33:38.840
I got you another one and I was
about to leave it in your locker,

33:39.280 --> 33:42.560
when I saw there was no need.
You never lost it.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.200
What's going on, Marga?
You've been lying to me all day.

33:53.720 --> 33:55.160
Where were you last night?

33:59.160 --> 34:00.840
I can't tell you.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.240
You can't tell me?

34:07.480 --> 34:09.360
Why can't you tell me?

34:10.239 --> 34:11.480
Because I can't.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.120
So don't keep on about it.

34:23.639 --> 34:27.040
I thought we could trust each other,

34:27.880 --> 34:29.840
but you've disappointed me.

34:31.720 --> 34:35.080
-Where are you going?
-To see Genaro. I promised Marisol.

34:35.159 --> 34:37.600
-Wait, I'll go with you.
-I'd rather go on my own.

34:47.760 --> 34:48.960
Come in.

34:58.040 --> 35:00.960
Finally, Alexandra!

35:01.040 --> 35:03.480
Sebastián, you are so much thinner.

35:03.560 --> 35:07.560
Really? The food here, it's so heavy,
I can't get used to it.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.560
You look splendid, as always.
How was the journey?

35:10.640 --> 35:12.240
It was long and tedious,

35:12.320 --> 35:14.600
but I already took all my luggage
to the hotel.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.520
-Where are you taking me?
-Sorry we're so late.

35:17.600 --> 35:22.000
Crossing the city has been an ordeal
ever since cars were invented.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.120
Don't worry, Doña Carmen.

35:24.200 --> 35:28.920
Let me introduce my sister,
Alexandra Uribe.

35:29.000 --> 35:29.880
Alex.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.960
-Alexandra.
-Alex.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.680
-Alex.
-I arrived this morning from New York.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.800
A six-day journey by ship and train.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.160
Now that is an ordeal, Mother,
unlike your morning commute.

35:40.240 --> 35:42.160
Is it your first time in Madrid?

35:42.240 --> 35:45.720
Yes, and I hope it's not the last.

35:45.800 --> 35:49.640
Alex and I always share
the major decisions in our businesses,

35:49.720 --> 35:52.000
so I hope she stays right here.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.040
You can count on my son Carlos

35:55.120 --> 35:58.400
for anything you need
until you get settled in.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.840
I'll certainly do that.

36:01.680 --> 36:05.120
Excuse me.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt,

36:05.200 --> 36:07.480
but your secretary wasn't at her desk.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.120
Elisa! What are you doing here?

36:10.200 --> 36:14.160
Elisa Cifuentes. Please, come in.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.200
Don't stand there in the doorway.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.760
We finally meet.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.440
I'm sorry it couldn't be sooner.

36:23.520 --> 36:28.760
The important thing is that
you look wonderful.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.760
I imagine my mother has already told you

36:32.840 --> 36:36.080
how keen I am to work
for the company's foundation.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.520
I haven't had the chance.

36:37.600 --> 36:41.240
We've just been meeting
Alexandra Uribe, my dear.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.240
She's Sebastián's sister,
and she's just arrived in the city.

36:44.320 --> 36:47.000
Alexandra, so nice to meet you.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.120
You'll love Madrid.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.240
Its bars, its theaters, its outdoor cafés.

36:51.320 --> 36:53.520
I'll soon have that life back again.

36:54.320 --> 36:57.400
That's good. And why is that, may I ask?

36:57.480 --> 37:01.520
Don't listen to her.
She's still recovering and sometimes...

37:01.600 --> 37:02.880
No, Mother.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.320
I'm having my marriage annulled.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.360
Well, we'll see about that.

37:08.360 --> 37:12.960
As you see, Mr. Uribe,
everyone has an opinion about me.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.680
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Uribe.

37:15.760 --> 37:18.160
I'll let you work.
I just wanted to introduce myself.

37:18.240 --> 37:22.800
-The pleasure's all mine, Mrs...
-Miss!

37:25.880 --> 37:28.800
-Alexandra. A pleasure.
-A pleasure.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.720
I'll see you to the door, dear.

37:30.800 --> 37:35.240
Carlos will stay here
because we still have matters to discuss.

37:42.720 --> 37:45.520
What was that scene all about?

37:45.600 --> 37:49.800
I don't know what you mean.
It was a normal conversation.

37:50.640 --> 37:53.120
Also, my closeness to Uribe

37:53.200 --> 37:56.120
could be very helpful
to the family, Mother.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.760
Leave those matters to your brother.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.040
Of course, I see...

38:01.120 --> 38:04.760
The family's natural-born seducer,
always one step ahead of me.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.160
This isn't a game.

38:07.200 --> 38:12.800
And your brother already has a plan
underway to get the company back.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.600
I can't believe
that you're actually an accomplice

38:17.680 --> 38:19.400
in his dealings with Francisco.

38:20.800 --> 38:23.120
I'm fed up, Mother.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.360
Fed up.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.920
I won't stop
until I get the respect I deserve.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.160
You should go home and rest.
We'll talk later.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.360
Heavens, Lidia.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.000
How nice to see you.

39:57.320 --> 39:58.200
Elisa...

39:59.880 --> 40:02.920
-I don't want any trouble.
-A bit late for that, isn't it?

40:03.680 --> 40:04.560
What is it?

40:05.600 --> 40:07.520
Aren't you going to ask about my health?

40:07.600 --> 40:10.200
Aren't you interested in my time
in the sanatorium?

40:10.280 --> 40:12.160
I was there because of you and Francisco.

40:13.320 --> 40:14.960
-I--
-Know what they do there?

40:16.480 --> 40:18.560
Do you know what I've been through?

40:22.280 --> 40:23.240
What do you want?

40:25.760 --> 40:27.160
To help you.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.480
Francisco is setting a trap for you.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.000
He's making you believe
that he wants to help you,

40:37.080 --> 40:40.120
when he's actually helping
my brother Carlos.

40:41.320 --> 40:44.920
You think he came back for you,
but he's going to betray you.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.240
But relax.

40:50.720 --> 40:54.240
Before he destroys you, I'll destroy him.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.320
Could I speak to you?

41:23.000 --> 41:25.480
Of course. Sit down.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.040
Something wrong?

41:34.320 --> 41:37.000
When you came to see me,
I went out to look for Mario

41:37.560 --> 41:39.640
in all the places I thought he might be.

41:40.040 --> 41:42.360
I had no luck and...

41:43.200 --> 41:44.840
when I got home...

41:46.560 --> 41:49.160
I found this in the garbage.

41:50.640 --> 41:51.840
But that's not all.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.880
When I went into the bedroom,
it was a mess.

41:55.960 --> 41:58.000
His case was gone, some clothes...

42:00.640 --> 42:03.280
and this note was on the floor.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.800
"Ángeles, I can't keep up this farce.

42:11.880 --> 42:13.600
I don't love you.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.680
I stopped loving you a long time ago.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.240
I'm in love with another woman,

42:17.320 --> 42:20.080
and I'd like to have the chance
to be happy with her.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.760
Our marriage hasn't been working,

42:21.840 --> 42:25.080
and neither of us deserves
to keep living like this.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.480
Sincerely, Mario."

42:31.600 --> 42:35.920
I'm sorry to have to ask you this, but...
do you know who she might be?

42:36.640 --> 42:38.960
When you cross the line
between good and evil,

42:39.040 --> 42:41.200
you see the world a different way.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.200
Has your husband been unfaithful
to you before?

42:46.400 --> 42:49.000
You then understand
that anyone in a difficult situation

42:49.080 --> 42:51.160
can make an unexpected decision.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.920
Even the people we believe
to be the most noble...

42:59.440 --> 43:00.960
You're trying to trick me.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.120
What?

43:02.200 --> 43:04.960
Elisa confessed
that you're helping Carlos.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.640
You're double-crossing me.

43:06.720 --> 43:09.360
What do you mean?
Elisa is resentful. Ignore her.

43:09.440 --> 43:10.760
She hates me. She hates us.

43:10.840 --> 43:13.200
Then how did she know we were meeting now?

43:14.640 --> 43:17.360
-You're a fraud.
-Wait. Stop, please.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.840
-Wait.
-Let me go! What do you want?

43:19.920 --> 43:21.360
I want you to believe me.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.120
Give me just one reason, Francisco.

43:25.200 --> 43:28.600
Give me one reason
why I should believe you!

43:32.760 --> 43:35.440
Because this morning
I asked her for an annulment.

43:35.960 --> 43:39.920
And from then on, all that's left
is for you to trust your own instincts.

43:40.880 --> 43:44.520
This morning, I told Elisa
I could never be with her again...

43:46.920 --> 43:48.720
because I can only think about you.

43:58.560 --> 44:02.000
Instinct almost never fails us.
At least, that's what we want to believe

44:02.080 --> 44:05.880
so we can keep feeling
that things are going to be okay,

44:07.600 --> 44:11.520
and that we are still
the masters of our destiny.

44:11.600 --> 44:13.320
And why are you so sure?

44:14.520 --> 44:16.840
Mario hasn't gone anywhere, believe me.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.040
He's not trying to start a new life.

44:20.920 --> 44:22.440
And I know because

44:22.520 --> 44:25.920
the money he stole to start
this supposed new life...

44:27.800 --> 44:28.840
I have it.
