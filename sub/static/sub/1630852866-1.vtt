may have made her-story,

00:07.840 --> 00:10.080
but the stakes are about to get
higher.

00:11.120 --> 00:14.040
I want a global superstar.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.640
With the UK as our host nation,

00:16.640 --> 00:19.040
for the first time in Drag Race
her-story,

00:20.560 --> 00:24.240
queens from different
franchises will be competing

00:24.240 --> 00:27.160
to be the ultimate Drag Race
superstar.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.480
Oh, wow.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.360
So play nicely ladies,

00:31.560 --> 00:35.360
and let the battle commence.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.640
And when it comes to snatch
game.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.320
Redundancy.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.560
I could've been casted in
"The Crown" after that,

01:44.560 --> 01:47.160
they gave it to an unknown
actress.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.960
When it comes to singing
challenges,

01:49.960 --> 01:51.640
like the Frock Destroyers.

- [RuPaul] She has it all.

01:59.760 --> 02:03.000
She's got the dirty, the sweet,
the sour.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.520
It's all in that Baga Chipz.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.880
- Oh, look, it's a little globe.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.600
Oh my God, we're going
international.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.720
This is UK vs the world.
(laughs)

02:13.720 --> 02:14.880
And I'm representing the UK,

02:14.880 --> 02:17.960
because you can't get more
British than Baga Chipz.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.920
As per usual, it's an evening
with Baga.

02:20.920 --> 02:23.880
Too famous for me own
good, why am I so famous?

02:23.880 --> 02:27.640
Now it's time to take over
the mother-tucking world!

02:31.160 --> 02:33.760
Is that Marge Simpson?

02:33.760 --> 02:34.680
Who's that?

02:38.000 --> 02:38.960
- I am Blu Hydrangea

02:38.960 --> 02:41.240
from "RuPaul's Drag Race UK"
season one.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.400
- She's blue.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.240
- Blu Hydrangea is always bright
colors,

02:45.240 --> 02:48.440
always fabulous and always out
of the box.

02:48.440 --> 02:51.800
Well, what's the craic? (laughs)

02:51.800 --> 02:52.600
(Irish music)

02:52.600 --> 02:55.560
I was the first ever Northern
Irish queen on Drag Race

02:55.560 --> 02:57.960
and I am proud of what I did
that season.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.160
I came fifth.

02:59.160 --> 03:03.320
I love creams in my eclairs,
in my buns and up my arse!

03:04.600 --> 03:07.680
Walking in to season one, I was
naive.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.080
I was shy, but now I am
glamorous,

03:11.080 --> 03:13.800
I'm fabulous, I'm confident.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.440
I have hosted gigs around the
world,

03:15.440 --> 03:19.000
hosted my own TV show, brought
out my own makeup line.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.680
I have my fingers in all the
pies.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.520
(Baga laughs)

03:21.520 --> 03:22.880
Hello!

03:22.880 --> 03:24.440
- D'you know what, I
didn't even know who it was

03:24.440 --> 03:26.560
until you spoke, 'cause you're
all blue.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.640
You look amazing!

03:27.640 --> 03:28.640
- Thank you, so do you, look at
this!

03:28.640 --> 03:29.880
- [Baga] Like a little smurf!

03:29.880 --> 03:31.360
- This is the best you've ever
looked.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.480
- I know, look, I've had a glow
up.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.080
I'm just that famous, I've
learned how to look decent.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.160
- I was nervous, but now
I'm not, look at you.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.000
I'm so excited to see Baga.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.680
This is one of my good
friends I work with a lot.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.200
Oh, mummy, I think someone
else is coming, let's sit down.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.560
- Come on Babby Blu.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.880
(dramatic marching music)

03:48.880 --> 03:51.280
(Blue gasps)

03:52.720 --> 03:53.760
- [Baga] Very very pink.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.600
- Oh my goodness.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.800
- Hello, I'm Cheryl Hole and you
know me

03:58.800 --> 04:02.600
for being the death-dropping
queen of season one.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.440
- Rawr.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.920
- Hello, divas.

04:05.920 --> 04:10.000
I'm ready for another
season of me doing mediocre.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.240
I was best known for
walking around the work room

04:14.240 --> 04:16.840
with no makeup on and a stupid
old wig.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.800
And just being a silly tit.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.120
Up your bum, no babies.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.000
(all cheer)

04:21.000 --> 04:25.440
Season one really kick-started
everything for me,

04:25.440 --> 04:27.160
it really put me on the right
track

04:27.160 --> 04:29.280
to finding my drag voice.

04:29.280 --> 04:33.640
- The look in her eye was just
utter joy.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.200
She was letting these children
have it.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.000
- Highest point was
meeting Cheryl of course.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.720
(tongue pops)

04:42.720 --> 04:44.480
(others scream)

04:44.480 --> 04:45.520
- Yes!

04:45.520 --> 04:47.120
- Now I hope these international
divas

04:47.120 --> 04:49.920
are ready for a slice of UK pie

04:49.920 --> 04:52.840
because we're here to
represent the UK in the world.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.320
- You look amazing, like
really, really, really good.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.240
- Thank you, honestly, I can't
believe

04:58.240 --> 04:59.360
we're the first three.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.480
- It's fabulous, I
missed you both so much.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.600
- Oh my god.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.200
- It's just gonna be UK season
one all over again, right?

05:04.200 --> 05:05.400
- I can't wait to see who's
gonna be here.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.680
- I wonder who's gonna come
from the different countries,

05:07.680 --> 05:09.440
because I can't understand

05:09.440 --> 05:10.880
when they speak different
languages.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.600
- I'm sure people are gonna
struggle with you, Baga.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.920
(all laugh)

05:16.360 --> 05:18.600
(all gasp)

05:19.560 --> 05:20.400
- Oh, wow!

05:22.920 --> 05:24.720
(Blu screams)

05:24.720 --> 05:27.000
- [Blu] You better work diva!

05:27.000 --> 05:29.080
- I'm Janey Jacke and I was

05:29.080 --> 05:31.440
from "Drag Race Holland" season
one.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.120
Told y'all I was gonna be back.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.680
This time you won't need
your subtitles though.

05:35.680 --> 05:36.520
- Yes!

05:38.440 --> 05:40.600
- In that season, I became a
runner up.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.120
I would have loved to
have taken that crown,

05:42.120 --> 05:45.120
but losing is the new
winning because now I'm here.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.400
For my crown.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.160
(speaking Dutch)

05:50.440 --> 05:52.160
The Netherlands and
Amsterdam in general is known

05:52.160 --> 05:55.280
for very talented artists,
amazing DJs.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.000
We're really forward in club
scenes.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.440
Obviously we were the country
with the first gay marriage.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.800
So I think all of these are
going to bring something

06:00.800 --> 06:03.320
really special to this
competition.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.920
Hello ladies!
(others scream)

06:06.920 --> 06:08.000
- So nice!
- I'm Cheryl.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.760
- So nice to meet you, I'm
Janey.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.240
I don't think I'll be easily
intimidated.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.920
- I love the blue, I must admit.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.400
- I have so much that people
don't know

06:16.400 --> 06:18.440
that I haven't been able
to show on my season.

06:18.440 --> 06:21.000
So I'm just going to
gag all these bitches.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.360
- How does it feel being the
first international queen?

06:23.360 --> 06:24.200
- Very fun.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.080
I was going to say you're all
UK,

06:25.080 --> 06:26.920
so this is you against me, I
guess.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.200
(all laugh)

06:28.200 --> 06:29.360
- Have you been to the UK before
though?

06:29.360 --> 06:30.880
- No, this is my first time.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.360
- Well, welcome, diva.

06:32.360 --> 06:35.040
- Am I doing this for my
country? I represent my country,

06:35.040 --> 06:37.920
but I'm here for me, girl, one
hundred.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.960
(dramatic music)

06:39.960 --> 06:40.920
- Is she a giant?

06:42.200 --> 06:43.920
- [Cheryl] Here we go, here we
go.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.840
- [Baga] She's got a heart
vagina.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.840
(all scream)

06:48.840 --> 06:50.480
- I'm Jimbo and I'm the sexy,

06:50.480 --> 06:53.320
big titted drag clown
from "Canada's Drag Race".

06:53.320 --> 06:54.680
Mom, I'm home!

06:57.480 --> 06:59.680
And I want a snack.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.760
I came in first place.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.200
(others laughing)

07:04.200 --> 07:05.800
Hmm, fourth, fourth, first?

07:05.800 --> 07:07.640
You know, it's a difference
of a few letters.

07:07.640 --> 07:10.200
- That was a cheese and ham
toasty she just threw at me.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.280
(others laughing)

07:11.280 --> 07:13.680
- Oh yeah. (screams)

07:13.680 --> 07:17.920
Jimbo and drag is all about
bigger, more.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.560
It's my special day!

07:21.760 --> 07:25.800
And taking the audience to
weird and wonderful places.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.920
Someone have my finger removed.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.920
(all cheer)

07:31.920 --> 07:33.120
Oh my god!

07:33.120 --> 07:36.480
I am so incredibly proud
to be representing myself

07:36.480 --> 07:38.080
and to be representing the
clowns

07:38.080 --> 07:40.080
and all of my beautiful country.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.280
I'm so, so excited to here.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.120
- [Cheryl] Well welcome to the
UK.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.080
- [Jimbo] Oh my god.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.520
- Welcome to the world, bitches.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.880
(others laughing)

07:46.880 --> 07:49.520
- You two are actually gonna
meet RuPaul.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.360
- Oh my god, yes!

07:51.360 --> 07:53.120
- And Michelle, I've
not even met Michelle.

07:53.120 --> 07:53.960
- Have you not?

07:53.960 --> 07:55.000
- No! I've not met anybody.

07:55.000 --> 07:55.920
You've met Michelle, right?

07:55.920 --> 07:57.280
- She sent me packing, that's
right.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.080
(all laughing)

07:59.080 --> 08:00.400
(dramatic music)

08:00.400 --> 08:01.960
- [All] Whoa.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.240
- Ooh, that looks fashiony.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.080
- [Janey] Who that? Who that?

08:04.080 --> 08:07.000
- Oh, oh!
- Look at them feet.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.120
- Yes!
- Beautiful.

08:09.120 --> 08:14.120
- [Cheryl] It's a family
reunion. (screams)

08:14.760 --> 08:17.080
- I'm Lemon from Canada's
Drag Race season one

08:17.080 --> 08:19.160
and I'm so excited to be here!

08:19.160 --> 08:21.760
- [Janey] Look at the fashion,
ladies.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.680
- I heard you missed your main
squeeze.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.800
I made it all the way to the top
five

08:26.800 --> 08:29.000
and I was hastily rushed out

08:29.000 --> 08:31.120
after a makeover challenge gone
awry.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.640
My critiques on this season were
like

08:32.640 --> 08:35.240
almost all positive except for
my runways,

08:35.240 --> 08:37.320
but that is not gonna happen
this time.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.800
I had the Drag Race glow up,
I got a little lip filler,

08:39.800 --> 08:41.360
and I'm ready to go.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.200
- Those are Louis Vuittons!

08:42.200 --> 08:43.280
- Oh wow, they are!

08:43.280 --> 08:44.160
- Oh, mummy.

08:44.160 --> 08:45.520
- She's rich.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.040
(all laugh)

08:47.040 --> 08:48.000
- True.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.280
(all laugh)

08:49.280 --> 08:51.600
(all cheer)

08:52.960 --> 08:53.800
- Hi, hello!
- So good to meet you.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.000
- So I'm half Scottish.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.400
So I'm like, okay, UK vs the
world,

08:57.400 --> 08:59.640
like I'm on both teams,
you know what I mean?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.920
Wow, I'm so happy, hi!

09:01.920 --> 09:02.760
International!

09:04.680 --> 09:06.800
I really, I'm gonna
fight till the very end.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.960
I'm gonna make this my fantasy.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.760
- So who's coming out on top
out of the Canadian Queens?

09:12.760 --> 09:16.520
- Oh, very, very, very good
question.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.240
I mean, Jimbo's a top in real
life,

09:18.240 --> 09:20.040
but I'm a top in the
competition, know what I mean?

09:20.040 --> 09:21.120
(all laugh)

09:21.120 --> 09:24.120
So I think it's probably
something like that.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.800
(all exclaim)

09:29.200 --> 09:31.400
- Is that a flag?

09:31.400 --> 09:32.880
- [Blu] Oh, mummy!

09:34.720 --> 09:36.640
- Thailand!
- Oh my god!

09:38.080 --> 09:39.400
Yes!

09:39.400 --> 09:41.240
(all cheer)

09:41.240 --> 09:42.640
- Are you joking?

09:44.680 --> 09:46.040
- My name is Pangina Heals

09:46.040 --> 09:49.400
and I am the co-host of
"Drag Race Thailand".

09:49.400 --> 09:51.480
(speaks Thai)

09:51.480 --> 09:52.640
Ready for Thai Tea?

09:52.640 --> 09:55.440
'Cause Pangina Heals is in the
house!

09:55.440 --> 09:58.240
(all cheer)

09:58.240 --> 10:00.040
- [Blu] Oh, mummy!

10:00.040 --> 10:01.640
- Thai drag is very meticulous.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.880
We love the finishings and the
details.

10:04.880 --> 10:08.280
The future of drag is onstage
today, huh.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.560
Our approach might be very
different

10:11.560 --> 10:13.280
and we don't like to play safe.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.680
(all scream)

10:17.280 --> 10:18.360
Hey guys!

10:18.360 --> 10:19.840
(all scream)

10:19.840 --> 10:22.760
- I am obsessed with the
Thailand series.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.120
I am so blown away that
she's going to be here

10:25.120 --> 10:28.160
and she looks absolutely
incredible.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.200
- Does it make you nervous to
know

10:29.200 --> 10:30.880
that we've competed and you have
not?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.600
- Because you guys had the edge?

10:32.600 --> 10:33.440
- Oh, we've got the edge girl.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.640
- Is that because you have
experience?

10:34.640 --> 10:35.600
- Oh, we've got experience.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.640
- [Pangina] Yeah.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.160
- Just have to sit there
and look pretty, right?

10:38.160 --> 10:40.560
- As a co-host, I'm used
to judging other people,

10:40.560 --> 10:42.600
but right now I am going to be
judged

10:42.600 --> 10:44.400
by the legendary RuPaul.

10:44.400 --> 10:47.120
So obviously it's a huge
pressure

10:47.120 --> 10:49.280
and it's not up to me anymore.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.200
- Well Pangina,

10:50.200 --> 10:52.560
I'm just so happy to have
someone here

10:52.560 --> 10:54.840
that hasn't won a challenge
as well, so thank you.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.360
Thank you so much for coming.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.120
(dramatic music)

11:00.120 --> 11:01.120
- [Blu] Who the hell is this?

11:01.120 --> 11:02.440
- Big dress.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.480
- Oooh!
- Oh!

11:09.400 --> 11:11.720
(all cheer)

11:14.680 --> 11:16.680
- Hello world, I'm back!

11:19.520 --> 11:21.000
- Whoa, oh.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
- [Blu] Oh my goodness.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.440
- Oh, girl.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.720
- The battle ain't yours, sis,

11:25.720 --> 11:29.440
buckle up cause I'm gonna be
here every week, thank you.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.600
(all laugh)

11:31.600 --> 11:33.840
Honey, my name is Monique Heart.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.240
You know me from season 10

11:35.240 --> 11:36.800
of "RuPaul's Drag Race All
Stars"

11:36.800 --> 11:40.480
for I was a finalist and now,
beloved,

11:40.480 --> 11:43.440
you see me on "Drag Race UK vs
the World".

11:43.440 --> 11:45.360
Brown cows, stunning.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.440
(others laugh)

11:46.440 --> 11:51.000
I would describe Monique
aesthetic as royal, regal,

11:51.000 --> 11:56.080
glamorous, extra singer,
writer, all around icon.

11:56.080 --> 12:00.080
I am it, darling.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.680
(others cheer)

12:04.040 --> 12:05.160
- Oh my gosh.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.680
Honey, Monique has grown and
elevated

12:07.680 --> 12:11.400
in so many ways and I just
can't wait for you all to see.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.360
Drag Race, I thought was mine.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.240
All Stars I thought was mine,
and I said,

12:15.240 --> 12:17.320
RuPaul, for you making this
competition,

12:17.320 --> 12:18.760
"Drag Race UK vs the World"

12:18.760 --> 12:19.640
I said, oh no, this is the one.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.400
Look at my head, honey, don't it
fit?

12:21.400 --> 12:22.960
Ooh, come on and put it right on
top.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.040
Put it right on top.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.320
- Now it's your third time,
girl.

12:26.320 --> 12:29.040
Do you think this is the time
that you're gonna win it?

12:30.960 --> 12:32.160
- If your pussy was that good,

12:32.160 --> 12:33.440
you would have won the first
time, too.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.280
(all laugh)

12:34.280 --> 12:36.120
- Girl, girl, she's
grown a lot in two years,

12:36.120 --> 12:36.960
but I'm back with a vengeance.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.920
- Not, apparently, coming in a
leotard.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.280
(all whoop)

12:42.400 --> 12:44.960
I know I'm a force and
I will not turn it down.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.040
- So, looking at all of us,

12:49.040 --> 12:52.120
how do you think you're going to
do?

12:52.120 --> 12:54.240
- I will be sending y'all hoes
home.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.640
(others laugh)

12:55.640 --> 12:57.120
- I'd like to see you try.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.640
- Oh my God, the girls are
fighting.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.480
The girls are fighting.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.520
- It's starting.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.160
We were all really nice
and then the US walked in,

13:04.160 --> 13:08.120
and we're all like (growls).

13:08.120 --> 13:10.560
(all gasp)

13:10.560 --> 13:12.240
- Well, she got body.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.160
- Oh, yeah.
- She got body.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.880
- [Lemon] Oh, she got little
legs.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.560
- I can't see a thing.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.160
(all cheer)

13:21.160 --> 13:23.040
- I'm Jujubee and you may know
me

13:23.040 --> 13:24.880
from Drag Race, season two,

13:24.880 --> 13:27.840
All Stars season one and five.

13:27.840 --> 13:28.880
- Stunning.

13:29.840 --> 13:33.520
- You've been expecting me.
(giggles)

13:33.520 --> 13:35.840
I have been a part of the Drag
Race family

13:35.840 --> 13:37.320
for over a decade.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.960
- She just has an it
factor that's undeniable.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.280
- A sensible 74.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.400
(RuPaul laughs)

13:45.400 --> 13:47.040
I'm literally a senior citizen.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.200
(all scream)

13:50.200 --> 13:52.160
- Oh my god, it's Jujubee.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.480
She is a Drag Race legend.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.480
She is an OG.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.320
- This is nuts.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.840
I can't believe that I
get to do this again.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.760
- We can't either.

14:01.760 --> 14:02.840
(all laugh)

14:02.840 --> 14:04.440
- Yeah, okay, so I guess we
could say

14:04.440 --> 14:06.600
that I've been around
the block a few times.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.200
Maybe fourth time's the charm.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.000
- But you've been in the
final every time, ain't ya?

14:10.000 --> 14:14.240
- That's my talent, yeah, to
get to the top and then lose.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.800
(all laugh)

14:15.800 --> 14:17.560
I am so excited to be
representing

14:17.560 --> 14:19.480
the United States of America

14:19.480 --> 14:21.720
in this international
competition.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.360
These bitches better watch out

14:23.360 --> 14:25.680
'cause (laughs) I'm here to get
them.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.320
- So, divas, here we are,

14:27.320 --> 14:31.400
the first cast of "Drag
Race UK vs the World".

14:31.400 --> 14:32.880
(all cheer)

14:32.880 --> 14:34.960
Girls, we are fierce, we are
fabulous.

14:34.960 --> 14:39.120
And I'm so excited to
see what everybody does.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.320
- Same.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.680
(alarm blares)

14:41.680 --> 14:44.200
- Oh no, no!

14:44.200 --> 14:45.680
Please let it be RuPaul.

14:45.680 --> 14:46.600
- [Pangina] Please let it be
RuPaul.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.480
- [Monique] I'm serious.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.640
- Girl, please tell me
there's no more girls

14:49.640 --> 14:50.720
coming in this room.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.640
(dramatic music)

14:53.640 --> 14:55.440
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.400
(all gasp)

14:56.400 --> 14:58.200
(RuPaul laughs)

14:58.200 --> 14:59.120
(all yell)

14:59.120 --> 15:01.400
(exciting music)

15:01.400 --> 15:03.160
- Oh my goodness.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.600
- Oh my god, it's mother Ru.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.040
It's my first time seeing him in
person

15:07.040 --> 15:10.880
and of course, you're coming
down from the heavens, honey.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.000
(all applauding)

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
- My queens, welcome to the
greatest drag show on Earth.

15:19.440 --> 15:23.560
"RuPaul's Drag Race UK vs the
World".

15:23.560 --> 15:25.880
(all cheer)

15:27.560 --> 15:29.560
Now, I've had the pleasure of
judging

15:29.560 --> 15:34.320
some of you in person, others
I've admired from afar.

15:34.320 --> 15:38.240
My oh my, how your charisma,
uniqueness,

15:38.240 --> 15:42.160
nerve and talent have blossomed.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.360
And by blossom, I mean filler.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.760
(all laugh)

15:45.760 --> 15:46.760
#DragRaceUK.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.600
At the grand finale,

15:50.600 --> 15:52.400
one winner will be crowned

15:52.400 --> 15:55.640
the queen of the mother-tucking
world.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.000
(all cheer)

16:00.200 --> 16:04.080
And record a duet with the
original

16:04.080 --> 16:06.760
supermodel of the world.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.680
That would be me.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.960
(all yell)

16:12.880 --> 16:13.960
- Oh my goodness.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.640
I cannot believe the
winner it gets to record

16:16.640 --> 16:17.880
a song with Ru!

16:17.880 --> 16:19.160
I mean, I'm a recording artist,

16:19.160 --> 16:21.440
ya know so this feels correct.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.440
- And a portion of the proceeds
will be

16:23.440 --> 16:28.120
split equally between Comic
Relief and Children in Need.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.440
(all cheer)

16:29.440 --> 16:30.280
- Here for it.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.920
- [Baga] Fabulous, I love that.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.400
- Ladies, for your first maxi
challenge,

16:36.400 --> 16:39.800
I'm throwing a royal command
performance.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.840
Tomorrow on the main stage,

16:42.840 --> 16:47.400
each of you must showcase
one of your many talents.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.480
- This is gonna be good.

16:51.480 --> 16:54.720
- Now in a departure from
regular Drag Race rules,

16:54.720 --> 16:59.520
you queens will be eliminating
each other.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.840
- Bye!

17:00.840 --> 17:02.360
- I'm really gonna miss you.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.520
- (laughs) More on that later.

17:07.480 --> 17:12.160
Graces, start your engines and
may the best drag queen win.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.360
(all cheer)

17:14.360 --> 17:15.200
- Bye!

17:17.200 --> 17:20.040
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go!

17:20.040 --> 17:22.960
(electronic music)

17:28.720 --> 17:29.880
- Oh my, yeah.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.000
- Wow!

17:33.000 --> 17:34.880
- Cool!
- It's bright.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.200
- Oh wow.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.400
- Honey, we're home!

17:38.400 --> 17:40.400
(all laugh)
- Wow!

17:40.400 --> 17:41.600
- It's smaller than our work
room,

17:41.600 --> 17:42.920
but I think it's beautiful,
yeah.

17:42.920 --> 17:46.120
- Yeah, ours had a giant
leaf, but this is gorge too.

17:46.120 --> 17:46.960
- Ladies,

17:47.800 --> 17:49.080
let's claim our sections!

17:49.080 --> 17:51.000
(all shriek)

17:51.000 --> 17:51.840
- [Cheryl] Right, where's my
bag?

17:51.840 --> 17:53.000
- This is so beautiful.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.040
It's so huge, and I cannot
wait to claim my station.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.800
- [Lemon] Oh my God.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.600
- Oh, Lemon.

18:00.880 --> 18:01.720
- Nice and close.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.440
- See, this was my station on
season one.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.800
- Yours is there.
- Yeah, I'm gonna go there.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.640
- Got it.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.920
- Oh, Blu, can you
click me? Oh, thank you.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.840
- That felt tight.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.360
- Oh, thank you.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.080
- Everybody's kind of
running around frantic.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.600
It's just full of excitement.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.480
All the girls are just
so happy to be here.

18:18.480 --> 18:21.200
- [Baga] Oh God.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.440
(glass shattering)

18:22.440 --> 18:25.400
- Oh God.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.440
- This is why we can't have nice
things.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.440
- Sorry!

18:28.440 --> 18:29.360
(Blu laughs)

18:29.360 --> 18:31.920
- I'm a big fan of Baga's, we
met on tour.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.480
And now that we're here in the
work room,

18:33.480 --> 18:35.240
we're just having a lot of fun
together.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.400
- So I think this is going
to be called clown corner.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.480
- Yeah, let's call it clown
corner.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.960
(Baga laughs)

18:41.960 --> 18:43.240
- Would you mind unzipping me at
the back?

18:43.240 --> 18:44.880
- Sure.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.360
- Okay, so looking at the
competition.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.680
- Already?

18:48.680 --> 18:51.360
- Blu's hair was the crunchiest.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.120
The costume to me was not that
solid.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.080
- You didn't like it?

18:55.080 --> 18:56.920
- I just wanted excellence.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.320
And I did not see it.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.760
Baga, I mean, you expect what
you expect.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.280
- You know what I loved?

19:02.280 --> 19:05.120
I loved that she showcased her
black bra

19:05.120 --> 19:05.960
and her white dress.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.720
- Baby, things like that.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.120
Now I don't know if that was the
point.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.520
- She look like somebody's
auntie going to a wedding.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.880
Ooh, ah, ooh it's so shady right
now.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.480
- I'm out of breath.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.560
- Did you notice a change

19:27.560 --> 19:29.560
whenever the Americans
came onto the stage?

19:29.560 --> 19:31.000
Like in the atmosphere,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.280
it felt really intense.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.960
- [Cheryl] Because when they
play the game they play for-

19:34.960 --> 19:36.160
- Yeah, yeah,

19:36.160 --> 19:37.880
and I noticed that because
they were standing over there

19:37.880 --> 19:41.520
reading every single one of
us while we were unpacking.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.920
We were all just having
a nice time unpacking.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.400
And the game started.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.680
The game was on.

19:46.680 --> 19:47.520
- Exactly.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.360
- It probably means a lot to
them though,

19:48.360 --> 19:50.320
they've been here more times
than us.

19:51.560 --> 19:52.760
- In the words of Mariah Carey,

19:52.760 --> 19:54.680
"Why are you so obsessed with
me?"

19:54.680 --> 19:55.680
Because I'm a bit confused,

19:55.680 --> 19:57.800
why we're all coming for each
other straight off the bat.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.240
So let's just let the
talent show do the talking.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.520
- [Baga] So is this your
first time having British tea,

20:04.520 --> 20:06.000
cup of British tea, like the
queen?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.840
- It's the first time a British
person served me some tea.

20:08.840 --> 20:09.640
(Baga laughs)

20:09.640 --> 20:11.000
Like the queen.

20:12.480 --> 20:17.120
- So do you know what
the dog's bollocks means?

20:17.120 --> 20:18.840
- Probably the balls.

20:18.840 --> 20:19.760
- Yeah, but if I said to you,

20:19.760 --> 20:22.120
"Juju, you're the dog's
bullocks."

20:22.120 --> 20:23.320
- I'm the shit.
- Yeah.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.640
- It means you're the
best, you're the shit.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.320
- Yeah.
- Oh really?

20:27.320 --> 20:29.400
I thought that would be a read,
okay.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.360
- Minger?

20:30.360 --> 20:31.320
- I know this one.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.160
- Do you know a minger?

20:32.160 --> 20:33.000
- It means you're ugly.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.200
- A minger is like you're
busted, or you're ugly.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.480
- You're busted.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.960
- You're busted.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.720
- They haven't got a clue
what I'm going on about

20:41.720 --> 20:42.760
if I'm totally honest,

20:42.760 --> 20:45.200
I wanted to teach them about
steak bakes,

20:45.200 --> 20:47.720
bangers and mash, the
underground,

20:47.720 --> 20:49.760
Prince Andrew in Pizza Express.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.520
Do you know what a slapper is?

20:51.520 --> 20:52.680
- A funny joke?

20:52.680 --> 20:55.600
- Yeah like you slap
your hands and ha ha ha.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.720
- No, it means you're
very, very promiscuous.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.960
- But is a slapper only for a
woman?

21:01.960 --> 21:03.960
- No, anybody can be a slapper.

21:03.960 --> 21:07.280
(laughs) Oh good, I love having
tea with you lot, really.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.800
I feel like I'm on "The
View" or something.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.720
- Baga's English lesson is
interesting.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.720
I'm learning many new words.

21:15.720 --> 21:19.040
None of them usable in
the common language.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.520
- Cheers, right?

21:20.520 --> 21:21.400
- Cheers, girls.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.480
(teacups clink)

21:23.480 --> 21:24.840
- You know what I love about the
UK,

21:24.840 --> 21:26.720
instead of saying,
excuse me, or thank you,

21:26.720 --> 21:28.960
they'll just say cheers and then
walk off.

21:28.960 --> 21:29.960
- Cheers.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.600
Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers!

21:32.600 --> 21:35.760
(exciting music)

21:35.760 --> 21:38.080
(all cheer)

21:40.320 --> 21:44.040
- "Drag Race UK vs the World".

21:44.040 --> 21:46.800
It's the first UK vs the
world elimination day.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.600
And we're getting ready for
the Drag Race variety show

21:49.600 --> 21:52.320
where we're showcasing
our own unique talent.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.120
- Oh, my sandwich.

21:54.120 --> 21:56.840
- Oh my god, you still got that
sandwich.

21:56.840 --> 21:57.920
- Are you excited for today?

21:57.920 --> 22:00.600
- I'm very excited for today
because I'm very excited

22:00.600 --> 22:02.800
to see everybody's talent.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.200
- Girl, I do feel like it's
gonna be a lot of songs,

22:07.200 --> 22:08.040
and a lot of dancing.

22:08.040 --> 22:11.040
- I think we have a lot of
dancing girls in this round.

22:12.800 --> 22:15.120
- So Monique, I have
something to tell you,

22:15.120 --> 22:16.880
the first ever time I met you,

22:16.880 --> 22:18.120
I really didn't like you.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.440
We were at a gig in Belfast,
right.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.320
And I was on the lineup,
I was opening up for you.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.360
And it was Brooklyn Heights
and all these massive queens.

22:26.360 --> 22:29.760
I was so star struck, but
I remember you were like,

22:29.760 --> 22:33.040
"Will you tie my shoelaces,
and like, hold my garments."

22:33.040 --> 22:36.160
And then shouted at me for not
keeping them off the floor.

22:37.280 --> 22:40.400
And I was like, "Oh my
gosh, she's such a diva."

22:40.400 --> 22:43.440
I mean, of all the queens
in Drag Race her-story

22:43.440 --> 22:45.400
Monique is probably one of the
only ones

22:45.400 --> 22:47.920
that I have had this kind of
moment with.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.720
but it's weird being
in the same work room,

22:49.720 --> 22:53.840
so why not bring it up and
you know, flatten this beef?

22:54.800 --> 22:56.000
(laughs) I can't believe I have
a beef.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.880
- I was moreso nervous of having
garments

22:58.880 --> 23:00.320
that they could read.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.120
- Of course.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.280
- And so I totally apologize for
that.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.440
- It was, no, not at all, I
just-

23:04.440 --> 23:06.120
- We all have Alyssa Edward
moments, okay.

23:06.120 --> 23:09.720
- It's just crazy the
difference in one day can make

23:09.720 --> 23:12.320
in this room, of getting to know
someone.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.520
Because I honestly would have
probably

23:13.520 --> 23:15.840
harbored that until I met you
again.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.480
You know, just been like, you
know-

23:17.480 --> 23:18.680
- She's a bitch.

23:18.680 --> 23:19.920
- She's a bit of a diva.

23:19.920 --> 23:23.560
- I do apologize, but I'll
call you when I need to zip.

23:23.560 --> 23:24.760
Thank you!

23:24.760 --> 23:25.960
- Cheryl's over there.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.400
(both laugh)

23:33.840 --> 23:35.560
- So looking around the room.

23:35.560 --> 23:36.480
- Yes, baby?

23:36.480 --> 23:39.680
- First elimination
day, how does that feel?

23:39.680 --> 23:43.320
- One thing, everyone is on
such a high caliber of drag.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.240
But with that said,

23:44.240 --> 23:46.520
I think there's added pressure

23:46.520 --> 23:48.960
with us, you know,
representing our country.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.240
- But do you feel like that
puts even more pressure for you

23:51.240 --> 23:52.280
because when you fuck up, girl,

23:52.280 --> 23:53.480
your whole country is going to
be like,

23:53.480 --> 23:55.240
"Oh, so you're representing us

23:55.240 --> 23:56.320
and this is what you brought?"

23:56.320 --> 23:58.680
- Yeah, I am nervous as hell.

23:58.680 --> 24:01.600
But then you gotta take
that out of your mind.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.840
- You gotta be confident
in what you're doing.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.440
- Yeah and you gotta just
represent you.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.640
- You haven't ever been judged.

24:06.640 --> 24:07.600
- I have been judged a
lot in my life just not-

24:07.600 --> 24:09.240
- But not by a panel of judges.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.080
- Yeah.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.640
- Right, are you scared of them?

24:11.640 --> 24:14.280
- I'm really good with taking
criticisms and penises.

24:14.280 --> 24:17.760
So I am just excited to
see what they will say.

24:17.760 --> 24:21.040
I'll take it, I mean it, if
you can't take the criticism,

24:21.040 --> 24:22.280
you can't learn.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.080
But the thing is,

24:23.080 --> 24:26.280
I feel like I'm sure
everyone has their mind

24:26.280 --> 24:27.920
in the game to play fair.

24:27.920 --> 24:28.800
I'm hoping, girl.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.680
- You're hoping, girl,

24:29.680 --> 24:31.520
that's just the thing, you never
know.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.680
- You never know.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.760
I think it's gonna take
time for me to be confident

24:34.760 --> 24:38.000
and comfortable because
I've never done this before

24:38.000 --> 24:39.360
and all the other girls have,

24:39.360 --> 24:44.440
so I need to just sink my
teeth in and see how things go.

24:44.440 --> 24:46.920
But I am a fast learner.

24:49.800 --> 24:53.480
- Can you believe it is
elimination day already?

24:53.480 --> 24:55.320
- No, honestly.

24:55.320 --> 24:56.160
How do you feel?

24:56.160 --> 24:58.160
- Well, it's a feeling that I
felt before.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.480
- How many times?

25:00.480 --> 25:01.760
- This will be my fourth time.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.600
- Yeah.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.920
- Although it's similar,
it's completely different

25:04.920 --> 25:07.560
because it's the entire world
competing.

25:07.560 --> 25:08.960
- And it's scary 'cause it's
week one,

25:08.960 --> 25:10.600
so one little mistake.

25:10.600 --> 25:14.120
- And you're out and like girl,
I feel so good having you,

25:14.120 --> 25:15.840
having you, and having Blu

25:15.840 --> 25:17.920
because you three are actually
like my

25:17.920 --> 25:19.120
three closest queens.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.680
- So what's the deal with you
and Jimbo?

25:20.680 --> 25:22.760
Are you guys like actually
sisters?

25:22.760 --> 25:25.040
- I really love Jimbo,
yeah, but we don't text.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.200
I don't even know if I have her
number.

25:27.200 --> 25:30.520
After the show I think she felt
robbed.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.680
She felt like she deserved to be
there,

25:32.680 --> 25:34.160
but I'm like, it's a
competition.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.160
Anything can happen.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.920
I think when you take
things like that personally,

25:36.920 --> 25:38.960
you have to realize it's bigger
than you.

25:38.960 --> 25:39.880
It was all of Canada.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.080
And then there were
such tough competitors.

25:42.080 --> 25:42.920
- Yeah.

25:42.920 --> 25:46.040
- Honestly, I'm not surprised
that Lemon and Jimbo

25:46.040 --> 25:47.440
aren't as close,

25:47.440 --> 25:50.720
because everybody's just
expects sisters to get on

25:50.720 --> 25:52.760
because you're forced
into this environment

25:52.760 --> 25:53.840
and you just think,

25:53.840 --> 25:55.840
"Oh, we're gonna be amazing,
sisters."

25:55.840 --> 25:57.640
Not everybody's gonna get on.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.320
Not everybody's gonna gel.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.640
- It's scary 'cause you
want to like rep for

26:01.640 --> 26:02.960
your whole country too.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.920
And it does feel like all of
Canada

26:04.920 --> 26:06.160
is looking at me and Jimbo.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.760
All of the UK is looking
at you three, you know?

26:08.760 --> 26:10.200
- But I don't want anybody to
think

26:10.200 --> 26:14.160
that just because we're
in the UK right now

26:14.160 --> 26:17.080
there's any hierarchy or
favoritism or anything like
that.

26:17.080 --> 26:20.560
- It has been UK versus the
world for centuries, darling.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.080
(upbeat dance music)

26:26.560 --> 26:29.000
- So ladies, when you think of
UK drag,

26:29.000 --> 26:30.400
what do you think of?

26:30.400 --> 26:31.480
- [Monique] Comedy.

26:31.480 --> 26:32.960
- Comedy?
- Comedy, yeah.

26:32.960 --> 26:33.840
- Do you think of like Baga
Chipz queens?

26:33.840 --> 26:35.200
- You're funny.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.000
- Actresses.

26:36.000 --> 26:36.840
- Actresses?

26:36.840 --> 26:37.960
- [Lemon] I would say alcohol.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.160
(others laugh)

26:39.160 --> 26:42.040
- I think of you and Sum
Ting Wong's hairline.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.560
(all laugh)

26:44.560 --> 26:46.040
- But how would you
describe the local drag

26:46.040 --> 26:47.160
for Canadian girls then?

26:47.160 --> 26:48.440
- [Lemon] I don't even know.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.720
- I think it's a lot of
like cabaret alternative

26:51.720 --> 26:54.400
performance-based, there's
like not a pageant scene really

26:54.400 --> 26:55.640
in Canada that much, right?

26:55.640 --> 26:58.600
- Yeah, but I think Canada
is like such a melting pot

26:58.600 --> 27:01.680
of people that like
the drag is so, I mean,

27:01.680 --> 27:03.120
literally me and Jimbo are like,

27:03.120 --> 27:05.800
the complete opposite
person, you know what I mean?

27:05.800 --> 27:07.120
- Well, let me ask you girls.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.600
I don't know how many have seen
my season

27:08.600 --> 27:09.440
all the way through.

27:09.440 --> 27:10.440
- I've seen it,

27:10.440 --> 27:12.440
"Nippa, nippa, nippa!"

27:12.440 --> 27:15.200
- But how do you girls
look at drag from Holland

27:15.200 --> 27:16.960
if you've been or not been or-

27:16.960 --> 27:19.400
- I was gagged to be perfectly
honest,

27:19.400 --> 27:23.560
like I felt Holland had
one of the strongest

27:23.560 --> 27:25.280
introductions to the world.

27:25.280 --> 27:26.120
- Yeah, the looks were on point.

27:26.120 --> 27:29.960
- We were like gagged
as far as, I'm serious.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.680
- What about Thailand?
I want to hear about it.

27:31.680 --> 27:34.680
- We don't have the same
word in Thai for drag.

27:34.680 --> 27:35.880
Like it doesn't translate.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.200
- Oh, is it something that you
can do

27:37.200 --> 27:39.360
as like a full-time job over
there?

27:39.360 --> 27:40.200
- If you're good at it.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.240
(Blu laughs)

27:41.240 --> 27:42.240
I've opened my own clubs.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.840
So the girls are working there
now.

27:43.840 --> 27:44.880
But because of the show,

27:44.880 --> 27:46.960
a lot of girls are working in
other venues

27:46.960 --> 27:48.600
other than just drag.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.800
One of the other girls
that I know is a farmer,

27:50.800 --> 27:51.960
a shrimp farmer.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.000
- Oh wow.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.280
- By day, but she doesn't
eat her own shrimp.

27:56.280 --> 27:58.280
It's a rule, you can't, it's bad
luck.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.480
- Do you know what
guys? I'm not gonna lie.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.520
I'm not gonna lie.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.520
We are who we are and I'm gonna
bring it

28:04.520 --> 28:07.160
on the fucking runway tonight.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.280
So let's do it and live
your authentic life.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.480

fans around the world.

48:13.440 --> 48:14.360
- No, they're not.

48:15.240 --> 48:19.080
- I am serving BDSM troll
doll that just had sex

48:19.080 --> 48:20.400
with a highlighter pen.

48:20.400 --> 48:21.520
It's fun to look at.

48:21.520 --> 48:24.720
It's a bit weird and it's
really bright and colorful,

48:24.720 --> 48:26.040
which is just Blu.

48:26.040 --> 48:28.200
Oh, oh, oh.

48:29.480 --> 48:31.360
- Wow.
- I'm wanking my hair?

48:31.360 --> 48:32.680
(others laugh)

48:32.680 --> 48:35.240
- Blu on season one could
never turn a look like this.

48:35.240 --> 48:38.320
It's a bit edgy, punk
rock and it's expensive.

48:39.680 --> 48:41.720
- [Graham] She's using
her platforms for good.

48:41.720 --> 48:42.560
(others laugh)

48:42.560 --> 48:46.400
♪ That's how I wanna hold you ♪

48:47.280 --> 48:48.680
- Welcome ladies.

48:48.680 --> 48:51.520
The official rules are as
follows.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.080
After critiques,

48:54.080 --> 48:57.440
I will choose the top
two queens of the week.

48:57.440 --> 49:00.560
They will go head to head and
toe to toe

49:00.560 --> 49:03.600
in a lip-sync for the world.

49:03.600 --> 49:05.360
And the winner gets the power

49:05.360 --> 49:08.280
to eliminate one of the bottom
queens.

49:08.280 --> 49:11.280
(tense music)

49:11.280 --> 49:13.520
Now, based on your performances

49:13.520 --> 49:18.520
and your runway presentations,
I've made some decisions.

49:18.920 --> 49:21.080
When I call your name,
please step forward.

49:22.480 --> 49:23.360
Monique Heart.

49:26.520 --> 49:27.360
Jujubee.

49:29.960 --> 49:30.800
Cheryl Hole.

49:34.400 --> 49:35.560
I'm sorry, my dears.

49:36.920 --> 49:41.320
But you are all safe.

49:46.120 --> 49:48.000
You may step to the back of the
stage.

49:56.560 --> 50:00.800
Ladies, you represent the
tops and bottoms of the week.

50:00.800 --> 50:03.520
Now it's time for the judges'
critiques

50:03.520 --> 50:05.600
Up first, Lemon.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.440
- Hi Lemon.

50:06.440 --> 50:07.280
- Hi.

50:07.280 --> 50:08.280
- Welcome to the UK.

50:08.280 --> 50:09.120
- Thank you.

50:09.120 --> 50:10.560
- You had a really hard job

50:10.560 --> 50:12.120
because starting off one of
these things,

50:12.120 --> 50:13.320
you were kind of setting the
tone,

50:13.320 --> 50:15.280
and I thought you did a great
job of that.

50:15.280 --> 50:17.680
The lyrics were funny,
there were jokes in there.

50:17.680 --> 50:20.120
I did worry that you'd
brought a huge staircase

50:20.120 --> 50:22.200
with you for no fucking point at
all.

50:22.200 --> 50:23.920
I'm guessing she'll go
up them at some point.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.440
Well, you did, Jesus, squashed
lemons.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.720
(all scream)

50:28.720 --> 50:31.760
- That jump you know, it's
impressive, but I will say this.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.440
I feel like we've seen it
before.

50:34.480 --> 50:36.520
- Well, Lemon, I loved the song.

50:36.520 --> 50:40.680
I think one of the things for
me, it lacked, with some face.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.760
You know, you looked a little
nonchalant.

50:44.120 --> 50:45.600
- Tonight, I think you looked
pretty.

50:45.600 --> 50:47.840
I think you look like a pageant
winner.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.640
Is a beautiful? Yes.

50:49.640 --> 50:52.080
Do I think you can elevate
higher than that? Yes.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.240
- Having heard the critiques,

50:54.240 --> 50:56.200
what would you have
done differently, Lemon?

50:56.200 --> 50:57.560
- Probably everything.

50:57.560 --> 50:59.560
I just wanted to show you
guys what it would be like

50:59.560 --> 51:02.360
if you came and saw
the Lemon Extravaganza,

51:02.360 --> 51:05.080
but obviously I've got
to push it a lot further.

51:05.080 --> 51:05.920
- All right, thank you.

51:05.920 --> 51:06.760
- Thank you.

51:06.760 --> 51:09.560
- All right, up next, Janey
Jacke.

51:09.560 --> 51:10.520
- Hi Janey.

51:10.520 --> 51:15.080
I wanna start with this look
because it is so beautiful.

51:15.080 --> 51:18.520
I wish that taste was in the
outfits

51:18.520 --> 51:20.760
that you were wearing in your
performance.

51:20.760 --> 51:22.400
Five looks is daring,

51:22.400 --> 51:26.080
but the issue was you started
on a black patent kind of PVC.

51:26.080 --> 51:26.920
And then when you took it down,

51:26.920 --> 51:29.720
we kind of saw these swinging
arms underneath the dress.

51:29.720 --> 51:32.760
The stuff was just a little
ill fitting all around.

51:32.760 --> 51:36.000
- I mean, I know how difficult
a quick change is offstage,

51:36.000 --> 51:39.120
nevermind onstage, but it
felt a little bit cheap.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.960
- What I appreciated
was you brought variety,

51:42.960 --> 51:45.960
though it didn't yell kind of
world-class

51:45.960 --> 51:47.880
in the way that we can now see
you are.

51:49.640 --> 51:50.800
- All right, thank you.

51:51.880 --> 51:53.880
Up next, Baga Chipz.

51:55.120 --> 51:55.960
- Hello.

51:55.960 --> 51:58.520
- Baga, I think you completely
embody

51:58.520 --> 52:00.960
the humor of British
drag, and I love that.

52:00.960 --> 52:05.600
You are giving me lots of
Spice Girl inspiration tonight.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.120
You lip-sync badly.

52:07.120 --> 52:09.560
(others laugh)

52:09.560 --> 52:11.080
- To her own song!

52:12.280 --> 52:14.360
- (laughs) But when you
were performing, I was like,

52:14.360 --> 52:17.200
there's a resemblance, Posh
Spice!

52:17.200 --> 52:18.320
(others laugh)

52:18.320 --> 52:22.000
But you know what, your
vocals are much better.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.560
(others laugh)

52:24.560 --> 52:27.480
- I had so much fun with that
song.

52:27.480 --> 52:30.680
It was so infectious
immediately.

52:30.680 --> 52:33.720
- Tonight, I'm so confused.

52:33.720 --> 52:34.960
I don't know if you're Joan of
Arc.

52:34.960 --> 52:37.360
I don't know if you're King
Arthur.

52:38.280 --> 52:40.240
- Yeah, it's 'cause I was
like, I wanted to be an Oscar

52:40.240 --> 52:41.080
and I was like-

52:41.080 --> 52:42.800
- An Oscar, okay.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.800
The idea of an Oscar, I get it
now.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.560
I get it because you're a
winner.

52:46.560 --> 52:47.440
(RuPaul laughs)

52:47.440 --> 52:48.440
- I thought in my mind,

52:48.440 --> 52:50.320
they're all gonna come
in like pageant queens

52:50.320 --> 52:51.720
and be very pageantry

52:51.720 --> 52:54.440
and I was like, I wanna
win RuPaul's Drag Race,

52:54.440 --> 52:56.720
but the next best thing's an
Oscar.

52:56.720 --> 52:57.840
- Yeah, well listen,

52:57.840 --> 53:00.640
based on your interpretation of
the Oscar,

53:00.640 --> 53:04.560
we won't have to worry about
copyright infringement.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.280
(all laugh)

53:07.280 --> 53:08.320
Thank you Baga.

53:08.320 --> 53:09.320
- Thank you so much.

53:09.320 --> 53:11.760
- Up next, Jimbo.

53:11.760 --> 53:13.840
- I love your kind of drag.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.480
What I really appreciated about
your act

53:15.480 --> 53:18.720
was you got in a plane in Canada
going,

53:18.720 --> 53:23.720
"Yeah, I'll do the PVC
with the cold meat act."

53:25.080 --> 53:26.840
I just love the confidence of
that.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.600
It was really, really funny.

53:28.600 --> 53:30.840
- I was confused.

53:30.840 --> 53:33.400
The despair I felt when the box
was empty,

53:33.400 --> 53:35.600
then you birthing meat, I was
elated.

53:35.600 --> 53:37.760
It stuck to you, even better.

53:37.760 --> 53:41.760
It was outstandingly weird
and I absolutely loved it.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.160
- Thank you so much, Mel.

53:43.160 --> 53:45.040
- Tonight, my goodness.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.960
This is magical, Jimbo.

53:46.960 --> 53:51.000
The details, the little balls,
all of it is just beautiful.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.760
- I am blown away by this
outfit and I loved your act.

53:54.760 --> 53:57.200
Was that the first time
you've done that specific act?

53:57.200 --> 54:00.440
- I have performed as that
character once before.

54:00.440 --> 54:03.480
- (laughs) Okay.

54:03.480 --> 54:05.640
For the Royal family, probably.

54:05.640 --> 54:07.920
(all laugh)
- That's right, yeah.

54:07.920 --> 54:08.760
Thank you.

54:08.760 --> 54:09.600
- Thank you.

54:09.600 --> 54:10.760
- Thank you.

54:10.760 --> 54:13.440
(RuPaul laughs)

54:13.440 --> 54:16.240
- All right, up next, Pangina
Heals.

54:16.240 --> 54:17.120
- Hi Pangina.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.320
(speaks Thai)

54:18.320 --> 54:19.920
So excited you're here.

54:19.920 --> 54:21.160
- I'm honored to be here.

54:21.160 --> 54:24.680
- I would imagine coming in
and showing the vulnerability

54:24.680 --> 54:29.040
of being a contestant probably
has a lot of pressure on you.

54:29.040 --> 54:30.080
A lot of stress.

54:30.080 --> 54:31.040
- All my friends were like,

54:31.040 --> 54:33.400
"Oh, if you come back on the
first week,

54:33.400 --> 54:34.520
we're not gonna talk to you
anymore."

54:34.520 --> 54:36.560
(all laughing)

54:36.560 --> 54:39.400
- Pangina, I couldn't
take my eyes off you.

54:39.400 --> 54:43.160
It was one of my favorite
performances in the variety show

54:43.160 --> 54:47.200
and this outfit tonight,
to be able to celebrate

54:47.200 --> 54:49.680
your culture in such a beautiful
way.

54:49.680 --> 54:51.000
I really appreciate that.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.600
- I love you so much Mel C.

54:52.600 --> 54:55.760
'Cause you were like, for me,
like you taught me girl power.

54:55.760 --> 54:57.000
Gaga taught me how to be a
woman.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.600
And RuPaul taught me
how to be a drag queen.

54:59.600 --> 55:00.800
And you're my like comedy icon.

55:00.800 --> 55:02.320
- Whatever, you're too late now.

55:02.320 --> 55:03.160
- [Pangina] I watch, no!

55:03.160 --> 55:06.120
(all laugh)

55:06.120 --> 55:08.480
- I love getting to know so much
about you

55:08.480 --> 55:10.080
in such a short amount of time.

55:10.080 --> 55:12.680
And that's what this challenge
is really designed to do.

55:12.680 --> 55:14.320
I'm very, very impressed.

55:14.320 --> 55:16.080
And you look beautiful tonight.

55:16.080 --> 55:16.920
Well, thank you.

55:16.920 --> 55:17.720
- Thank you.

55:18.880 --> 55:20.960
- Blu Hydrangea.

55:20.960 --> 55:22.560
- Blu, how are you?

55:22.560 --> 55:23.880
- I'm good thank you, how are
you?

55:23.880 --> 55:25.560
- I'm well, thank you.

55:25.560 --> 55:27.960
Let's start with your
performance.

55:27.960 --> 55:29.720
It was so fun.

55:29.720 --> 55:31.480
- The one thing I've always
struggled with you Blu is,

55:31.480 --> 55:33.800
you're so sweet and you're so
young,

55:33.800 --> 55:36.520
it's always a shock when you're
quite as filthy as you are,

55:36.520 --> 55:38.120
(all laugh)

55:38.120 --> 55:39.600
I mean, I'm not a prude.

55:39.600 --> 55:42.160
But I'm always like, slightly
kinda, ooh.

55:42.160 --> 55:43.520
- Blu, welcome back.

55:43.520 --> 55:44.360
- Thank you.

55:44.360 --> 55:45.600
- Had you done that act before?

55:45.600 --> 55:47.840
- I have with the Spice Girls.

55:47.840 --> 55:48.680
- [RuPaul] Really?

55:48.680 --> 55:50.080
- I was Geri, and I had
obviously

55:50.080 --> 55:52.440
life-sized versions of you on my
side.

55:52.440 --> 55:55.080
- Oh, that's a way of
keeping Geri in time.

55:55.080 --> 55:56.040
(all laugh)

55:56.040 --> 55:58.600
We should do that next time we
go out.

55:58.600 --> 56:00.680
I absolutely loved your
performance.

56:00.680 --> 56:03.040
I think it might've been
my favorite, actually.

56:04.360 --> 56:07.200
- The look tonight, the
troll meets club kid,

56:07.200 --> 56:10.440
but I don't know if it says I'm
a winner.

56:10.440 --> 56:11.960
- I'm completely confused.

56:11.960 --> 56:13.480
I feel like you got the wrong
memo.

56:13.480 --> 56:16.640
So as great as it is, I
think it's a great look.

56:16.640 --> 56:19.120
It just really didn't
fit into the vibe for me.

56:19.120 --> 56:19.960
- Thank you.

56:22.960 --> 56:26.240
- Ladies, based on the judges'
critiques,

56:26.240 --> 56:27.600
I've made some decisions.

56:31.400 --> 56:32.240
Jimbo,

56:33.320 --> 56:34.280
Pangina Heals.

56:36.600 --> 56:39.880
You are the top two queens of
the week.

56:39.880 --> 56:40.680
Congratulations.

56:40.680 --> 56:43.440
(others applaud)

56:45.240 --> 56:48.520
Baga Chipz, Blu Hydrangea,

56:49.520 --> 56:51.040
you are both safe.

56:54.240 --> 56:57.920
Lemon, Janey Jacke, I'm sorry,
my dears,

56:57.920 --> 57:00.640
but you are in the bottom.

57:04.240 --> 57:06.160
Jimbo, Pangina.

57:07.120 --> 57:10.840
Each of you needs to decide
which of the bottom queens

57:10.840 --> 57:14.280
you'll eliminate if you win the
lip sync.

57:15.600 --> 57:19.120
So, while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

57:19.120 --> 57:23.280
the judges and I will
pop down to the chippy.

57:23.280 --> 57:24.960
(others laugh)

57:24.960 --> 57:26.160
You may leave the stage.

57:27.960 --> 57:30.560
- Yes!
- Yes, we did it!

57:30.560 --> 57:33.440
- Can't believe it.
- The top, oh my God.

57:33.440 --> 57:34.920
- Never topped before.
- I love being a top.

57:34.920 --> 57:36.680
Makes me so thirsty.

57:36.680 --> 57:38.840
- Ooh, we get to have a
cocktail.

57:38.840 --> 57:40.160
Do they have ice?

57:40.160 --> 57:45.120
Baby, I am cracked, after all
this fabric,

57:45.120 --> 57:47.480
but at least the bitch ain't
going home.

57:48.520 --> 57:52.560
- [Cheryl] Well divas,
con-drag-ulations to the top
two.

57:52.560 --> 57:53.440
(all cheer)

57:53.440 --> 57:55.200
- Cheers!
- Oh my god!

57:56.840 --> 57:59.720
- How do you feel, Pangina
and Jimbo, winning?

57:59.720 --> 58:01.960
- I just can't believe
it, like last night,

58:01.960 --> 58:03.320
I was like, for sure,

58:03.320 --> 58:05.840
I'm going home first because
I'm so inspired by you guys

58:05.840 --> 58:07.520
and I watch you guys and I'm
like,

58:07.520 --> 58:10.760
they're so nice in person
and Cheryl, she's so nice.

58:10.760 --> 58:13.400
Like, up-close, 'cause on
TV, I was like, I hated her.

58:13.400 --> 58:14.920
(all laugh)

58:14.920 --> 58:16.240
- Girl, everybody did.

58:16.240 --> 58:19.040
- I was like, she's
really not that annoying.

58:20.560 --> 58:22.280
- You haven't even competed on a
season.

58:22.280 --> 58:25.280
So I just want to say you
are phenomenal, truly.

58:25.280 --> 58:26.440
- Thank you.

58:26.440 --> 58:29.000
I have just leveled up like a
Pokemon.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.400
I wanted to show these girls,

58:30.400 --> 58:32.760
not only am I a judge
on "Drag Race Thailand",

58:32.760 --> 58:34.440
but that I still got it.

58:36.560 --> 58:37.760
But what about you?

58:37.760 --> 58:41.960
- I am blown away, I am so over
the moon,

58:41.960 --> 58:46.960
it is my dream to clown for
Ru and I was taking a risk,

58:47.200 --> 58:48.840
but of course it's so terrifying

58:48.840 --> 58:50.760
because everyone is so
incredible.

58:50.760 --> 58:52.880
We have all just come together.

58:52.880 --> 58:56.320
We've flown so far competing
to become, you know,

58:56.320 --> 58:58.600
the best drag queen in the
world.

58:58.600 --> 59:01.800
And so it's a really hard thing

59:01.800 --> 59:04.240
to have to send someone home.

59:04.240 --> 59:05.800
- Lemon, my diva, how are you
doing?

59:05.800 --> 59:07.800
Because I've just got to
say, you did turn that out.

59:07.800 --> 59:10.520
- You did, you screamed-
- You with your litty kitty.

59:11.960 --> 59:17.000
- I feel

59:17.000 --> 59:18.760
shook. (laughs)

59:18.760 --> 59:20.920
I didn't quite like expect

59:26.760 --> 59:28.000
to be in the bottom.

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
And I have been in this
exact position before.

59:32.080 --> 59:35.160
And I just really wanted to,
sorry. (sobs)

59:39.640 --> 59:40.920
- Lemon, I think I speak for
everyone

59:40.920 --> 59:41.840
when we thought you were
amazing.

59:41.840 --> 59:44.680
And we were gagged.

59:44.680 --> 59:48.680
- I do not think that I
had the worst performance

59:48.680 --> 59:49.960
by a long shot.

59:49.960 --> 59:52.240
And I don't think that
I had the worst runway.

59:53.680 --> 59:55.080
- How do you feel, Janey?

59:55.080 --> 59:58.000
- We're all coming here being
invited, UK versus the world.

59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.240
We're all really great
entertainers.

1:00:00.240 --> 1:00:02.400
We all bring something
really elevated and amazing.

1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:04.800
So it is nitpicking, it's
that small little details.

1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:06.200
It's those little, little
things.

1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:08.320
It sucks being in that position
now,

1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:10.680
but fine bitch, who's gonna go
home?

1:00:10.680 --> 1:00:14.560
- Okay, Pangina and I have
our work cut out for us.

1:00:14.560 --> 1:00:17.240
We've got to have a little
meeting with the girls.

1:00:17.240 --> 1:00:18.680
Can I go with first Pangina?

1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:20.120
- Yeah, come on sis.

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:22.920
- I mean, no one wants to go
home first.

1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:25.000
I really feel for Lemon and
Janey because

1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:32.160
I don't wanna be in their shoes.
(laughs)

1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:37.360
- It's so hard, in the back
of my mind, I'm just like,

1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:39.080
my sister is in pain.

1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:42.680
- I have to be here and
I have so much to show.

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:44.120
- You've so much to show.

1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:47.680
- And, I'm just, you know.

1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:50.040
- Oh God, it's hard.

1:00:54.840 --> 1:00:57.320
I wanna say, I'm just going
to pick you, but I can't.

1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:58.480
I have to listen to Janey

1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:00.040
and I have to really think about
it.

1:01:00.040 --> 1:01:02.760
- I don't know if there's
this Canadian sisterhood

1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:05.120
that would go beyond a
competition.

1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:07.240
Jimbo does know what I'm capable
of.

1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:09.840
And I hope that she would
give me another shot.

1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:13.640
- How are you feeling?

1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:15.080
- It sucks being in the bottom.

1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:16.400
- Yeah.

1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:19.640
And we're like from the
country that basically

1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:22.200
the only representative, so
I understand how you feel

1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:24.640
and it's crazy, 'cause
I'm closer to you too.

1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:26.920
- We really got to know each
other, girl.

1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:28.600
- Yeah, for sure.

1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:31.000
I think I made a connection with
Janey

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.680
and I don't know if it's
enough for me to save her

1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:38.440
because a reveal is supposed
to be like, wow, wow, wow!

1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:41.280
But it's more like, mm, huh, oh.

1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:44.680
- I think based on the judges'
critiques,

1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:46.520
I did bring an original act.

1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:49.600
Lemon did something that
they said, "We've seen this."

1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:51.400
We both did a pageantry look.

1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:53.760
I think mine was more elevated.

1:01:53.760 --> 1:01:54.760
- Okay, thank you.

1:01:54.760 --> 1:01:58.440
- I'm hoping that Pangina
would actually save me

1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:00.600
because we have been
keekeeing and it's cute,

1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:01.520
but you don't know if they're
gonna go

1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:03.000
for alliances or feedback.

1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:09.600
- How do you think the
winners are gonna vote?

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:10.880
'Cause I'm sitting here-

1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:11.960
- I think I know.

1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:13.800
- The way that they split up,

1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:18.840
like Jimbo and Lemon,
are from the same season.

1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:22.000
- And they have literally
been glued to the hip.

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.240
- Glued.

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:25.480
- Let me just say like right off
the bat,

1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:27.200
that performance, legendary,

1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:29.320
it's gonna be means, it's gonna
be insane.

1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:30.760
'Cause couldn't believe
you jumped from there.

1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:32.200
- (laughs) Thank you.

1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:33.040
- Iconic.

1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:35.640
That performance was insane.

1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:37.000
I cannot believe she did that.

1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:41.160
But was it original,
have I seen it before?

1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:42.160
Definitely.

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.040
- It just feel like tonight
should not be the night

1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:45.880
that I go home.

1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:48.560
Tonight should not be the end
of my run in this competition.

1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:50.200
But I know you guys are close.

1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:52.800
- I don't think it's even
the fact that we're close.

1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:54.080
Like, honestly I want you to
know,

1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:58.520
like that's not gonna
be in my deciding factor

1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:00.960
and I can feel that you
really wanna be here.

1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:01.880
- Definitely, really do.

1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:03.240
I don't know that either girl
has even

1:03:03.240 --> 1:03:04.480
made up their mind yet,

1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:07.760
but I can't help but feel
like there's a right decision

1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:10.800
in this thing, and the right
decision is to keep me.

1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:14.360
- I thought you were amazing
and I loved your concept

1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:15.960
and yeah, you know,

1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:18.960
you wanna say that you're
going to look after your sister

1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:20.520
because of your bond, but you
know,

1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:23.200
it's kind of to my
advantage to get rid of her

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:26.040
because then I'm the queen of
Canada here.

1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:27.080
- Right.

1:03:27.080 --> 1:03:30.600
- But then at the same
time, she's my sister.

1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:33.240
So it's really difficult.
- True.

1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:36.920
- Jimbo keeps bringing Lemon up,

1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:39.320
but I'm trying to fight
here for my place, girl,

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:41.560
let me talk about me.

1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:44.080
- God, it's so hard
because I also didn't like

1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:47.160
that your sleeves were
dangling under that dress.

1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:48.000
So I'm like, hmm.

1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:50.800
I almost wanna rock paper
scissor it.

1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:51.640
- Yeah.

1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:56.080
- I have a lot to bring,
and there's only one.

1:03:56.080 --> 1:03:58.520
- There's only one Holland girl
here.

1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:01.120
- So that should go on
more into the competition.

1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:04.880
- You don't want a whole
country to be like, "You bitch!"

1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:07.680
But either way a whole country's
gonna say you're a bitch.

1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:09.120
So I'm like damn.

1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:11.400
- [Janey] I'll leave you to it.

1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:14.000
- Oh, this is so hard.

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:15.680
What would you do, tiny
umbrella?

1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:17.880
Any advice?

1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:20.520
Oh, you're no help at all.

1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:26.840
- Hi guys, fish and chips are on
me.

1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:27.680
Michelle, what are you gonna
have?

1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:31.360
- Okay, I'll keep it
simple, no fish, chips only,

1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:34.360
but the chips can't be fried
in the same oil as the fish

1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:37.320
'cause gluten, so chips
only, separate oil.

1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:39.160
- Okay, sure.

1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:40.000
Melanie?

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.440
- I would like chips, peas and
gravy.

1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:44.840
Mushy peas, but not too mushy.

1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:46.400
- Just a little bit mushy.

1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:47.440
Okay, got it.

1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:48.600
Graham, what are you gonna have?

1:04:48.600 --> 1:04:51.280
- Ooh, I'll have a nice
big battered sausage,

1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:52.600
Obviously, no batter.

1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:53.680
- Got it, great.

1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:55.920
Hello?

1:04:55.920 --> 1:04:59.520
I'd like to order three large
pepperoni pizzas, please.

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:01.120
- Ooh, i we're going to do
pizza-

1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:03.720
- Silence, I've made my
decision.

1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:05.600
Bring back my girls.

1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:07.000
Oh and what are you wearing?

1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:10.520
(others laugh)

1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:15.080
- Going into this deliberation,

1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:18.040
it's quite tough because
we gotta send girls home.

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.680
I have a lot to think about.

1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:23.840
So I'm basing this on

1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:26.880
what the judges say and what
I've seen in the performance.

1:05:27.800 --> 1:05:28.960
It's really tough.

1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:32.960
But I have to do it.

1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:34.400
- When determining my choice,

1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:38.760
it's a lot of good versus evil.

1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:40.640
The good's, like, "Ooh,
save your little sister."

1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:42.760
The evil's like, "Send the bitch
home."

1:05:44.480 --> 1:05:46.720
Janey Jacke, I love her.

1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:49.520
And so I wanna really give
her the benefit of the doubt.

1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:55.040
And so it's a lot of pressure
to make the right decision.

1:05:57.160 --> 1:06:00.480
(suspenseful music)

1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:02.280
- Welcome back ladies.

1:06:02.280 --> 1:06:06.360
Two internationally acclaimed
queens stand before me.

1:06:08.520 --> 1:06:09.760
Prior to tonight,

1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:13.200
you were asked to prepare
a lip-sync performance

1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:16.040
of "Say You'll Be There"
by the Spice Girls.

1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:20.360
Ladies, this is your chance to
impress me

1:06:20.360 --> 1:06:22.320
and earn the power

1:06:22.320 --> 1:06:25.040
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

1:06:27.440 --> 1:06:31.040
- Now I have to do a lip
sync to a Spice Girls song

1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:33.160
in front of a Spice Girl.

1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:36.520
Can you ask for more in your
life?

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:39.000
- The time has come.

1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:42.680
For you to lip sync for the
world!

1:06:50.280 --> 1:06:52.000
- I am praying to the Spice Gods

1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:54.840
to take over this body and to
elevate me

1:06:54.840 --> 1:06:57.280
to the winning position.

1:06:57.280 --> 1:06:58.280
- Good luck.

1:06:58.280 --> 1:07:03.280
And don't fuck it up.

Ladies, I've made my decision.

Pangina Heels,

You're a winner, baby.

1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:05.400
I did not do good.

1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:08.080
- Will the bottom two
queens please step forward?

- Oh shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit.

1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:23.040
- Pangina, with great power
comes great responsibility.

1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:28.560
Which queen have you
chosen to get the chop?

1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:30.920
(tense music)

1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:33.360

I've known everyone the
same amount of time,

1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:38.560
but I'm choosing this
person out of the idea

1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:42.840
of which show was original
and I have made the decision

1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:47.480
that I'm sending Lemon home.

1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:54.600

1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:58.160
- As it is written, so it shall
be done.

1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:03.160
Lemon, you are and will
always be a global phenomenon.

1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:08.840
Now, sashay away.

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:13.520

1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:15.160
I'm honored to have even been
here

1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:19.720
and I'm a little shook up, but
thank you.

1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:20.720
- I'm so sorry.

1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:22.320

very, very heartbroken.

I'm proud of what I did and
I'm proud of what I put forward

1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:53.800
and I don't think Pangina
made the right choice,

1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:57.160
but hopefully Jimbo will
bring back that crown.

1:11:57.160 --> 1:11:58.920
I couldn't take over the world
here,

1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:01.720
but I'll take it over somewhere
else.

yourself,

how the hell are you going
to love somebody else?

1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:15.080
Can I get an amen up in here?

like this

in a Wetherspoon's toilet,

1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:53.800
trying to text their ex.

- I don't know what's going on,
but you need to stop it now.

1:12:57.400 --> 1:12:58.840
- When I saw you with the puff
sleeve,

1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:01.280
I said, "Why are we at drag
brunch?"

1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:04.320
Not even drag brunch, like
my first time in drag.
