00:07.790 --> 00:09.444
- I mean...

00:09.487 --> 00:12.229
- What's so funny?
- Come on, April. Tell him.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.231
- It's a nurse thing.
You wouldn't get it.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.190
- Come on.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.018
- Our shifts about to start.
Sorry.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.849
- I don't know why
I'm so tired this morning.

00:23.893 --> 00:26.374
- Really you don't know?

00:26.417 --> 00:28.854
- Oh, maybe I have some idea.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.508
- I'm just happy
you're back home

00:30.552 --> 00:33.250
and the whole gun
thing is behind us.

00:33.294 --> 00:36.471
- Excuse me, Dr. Halstead.

00:36.514 --> 00:37.776
- Hey, Earl. What's up?

00:37.820 --> 00:40.823
Sorry to interrupt
but it's about your car.

00:46.437 --> 00:48.526
- Seems they pried
the latch open.

00:48.570 --> 00:51.703
- Oh, my God,
he literally just parked.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.662
What was it,
like ten minutes ago?

00:53.705 --> 00:55.229
- My guess is whoever did this

00:55.272 --> 00:57.361
cased out Dr. Halstead
specifically.

00:57.405 --> 01:00.147
Knew his schedule,
what he might leave in the car.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.236
- Mine was the only car
broken into?

01:02.279 --> 01:03.802
- Yeah, seems so.

01:03.846 --> 01:05.413
- Oh, my God, Will.
I can't believe

01:05.456 --> 01:08.633
you left this back here.
Your laptop's inside.

01:08.677 --> 01:10.722
I'm surprised
they didn't take it.

01:10.766 --> 01:13.812
- They must have gotten scared
off before they found it.

01:13.856 --> 01:16.554
See anything missing,
Dr. Halstead?

01:16.598 --> 01:20.123
- No, it doesn't look like it.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.125
- Well,
you must have got lucky then.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.654
- Here you go, Top Gun.
You're going to treatment 5.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.134
And take Terry with you.

01:31.178 --> 01:34.224
It seems like he needs
something to do.

01:34.268 --> 01:35.573
- Come on.

01:37.706 --> 01:40.143
Good morning,
Mr. Kaminsky.

01:40.187 --> 01:43.146
Hi, I'm Dr. Choi and this
is Student Doctor McNeal.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.539
I understand
you're experiencing

01:44.582 --> 01:46.367
some palpitations
in your chest?

01:46.410 --> 01:48.499
How about you unbutton your
shirt so I can take a listen.

01:48.543 --> 01:49.935
- Sure.
- I see we already took

01:49.979 --> 01:52.764
your blood pressure.
- 226 over 117.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.679
- That's high,
isn't it?

01:54.723 --> 01:57.769
- A lot higher
than I'd like to see it, yes.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.728
All right,
take a deep breath for me.

01:59.771 --> 02:03.166
- And exhale?

02:03.210 --> 02:05.429
Then another?

02:05.473 --> 02:07.736
Exhale.

02:07.779 --> 02:10.478
All right. Bilateral crackles
with mild rhonchi.

02:10.521 --> 02:12.610
- That doesn't sound good.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.743
- Not time to panic yet
but it's good you came in.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.397
I want to run a few tests
and give you something

02:16.440 --> 02:17.615
to bring
down that blood pressure.

02:17.659 --> 02:20.270
Excuse me.

02:20.314 --> 02:23.578
Hey, Hank. Start an IV
and give 20 labetalol, please.

02:23.621 --> 02:24.883
- Absolutely.

02:24.927 --> 02:26.798
- Let's get a CBC,
CMP, troponins,

02:26.842 --> 02:28.844
and set him up with
an EKG and renal ultrasound.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.280
- Right.

02:37.026 --> 02:39.202
Hey, Hank.
Everything all right?

02:42.510 --> 02:44.207
Where are you going?

02:48.255 --> 02:52.563
- Is he okay?
- I'm sure it's nothing.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.826
Terry, clean this up,
and let's get that IV started.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.350
- All right.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.617
- It's okay. It's okay.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.971
- Hey, what's going on?

03:36.128 --> 03:39.001
- Hey, what happened to Hank?
- He's not feeling well.

03:39.044 --> 03:42.396
- Does he know that patient,
Kaminsky?

03:42.439 --> 03:45.399
April, what's going on?

03:45.442 --> 03:46.835
- Sorry.

03:46.878 --> 03:49.185
- Hey, hey, hey, come on.
It's me.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.405
You always read me in.

03:51.448 --> 03:52.797
- Not this time.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.542
- Maggie?
- Yep?

03:58.586 --> 04:01.502
- Patient in 2's got a small
splenic crack without a blush.

04:01.545 --> 04:02.938
Let's send her upstairs
for observation.

04:02.981 --> 04:05.027
- I'm on it.
- Thanks.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.380
Morning.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.817
- That's really
all you're going to say?

04:12.861 --> 04:15.559
- Um, what else
do you want me to say?

04:17.082 --> 04:19.128
- Um, sorry would be a start?

04:19.171 --> 04:21.478
- Yeah, I'm sorry things
turned out this way.

04:21.522 --> 04:23.524
- Turned out?

04:23.567 --> 04:24.742
Things didn't turn out.

04:24.786 --> 04:25.917
You accused me of sleeping

04:25.961 --> 04:27.528
with your detestable father.

04:27.571 --> 04:28.877
- I'm not going to keep
rehashing this, Ava.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.966
- Oh, you poor thing.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.708
- Connor, incoming.
You're going to Baghdad.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.890
- What do we got?
- Bode Isiah, 23,

04:41.933 --> 04:44.458
motorcycle versus car, GCS 12,

04:44.501 --> 04:48.549
BP 110 over 70, heart rate 120,
O2 sats 98%.

04:48.592 --> 04:49.941
- He's obviously in a lot
of pain, seems to have taken

04:49.985 --> 04:51.682
most of the trauma
to the torso.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.424
- All right, let's get
a chest X-ray in here now.

04:58.123 --> 05:01.736
- All right, on my count.
One, two, three.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.085
- Ugh!

05:03.128 --> 05:04.739
- All right, Bode,
we're going to take care

05:04.782 --> 05:06.915
of that pain, okay?
Give me 50 of fentanyl.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.874
- Yeah.
- I'm HIV positive.

05:09.918 --> 05:12.094
- It's good to know but we're
prepared for that, okay?

05:12.137 --> 05:13.878
Just let us take care of you.

05:13.922 --> 05:16.098
All right, Bode.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.143
Can you move your head up
and down for me?

05:18.187 --> 05:20.189
There we go, very good.

05:20.232 --> 05:21.930
Now how about left and right,
okay?

05:21.973 --> 05:24.106
All right, C-spine's clear.

05:24.149 --> 05:26.108
Let's roll him
and get a board out.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.937
One, two, three?
- Ahh!

05:28.980 --> 05:30.939
- Hey, what's the hold up
on the fentanyl I asked for?

05:30.982 --> 05:33.115
- I already gave it to him.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.899
- All right, let's get
the X-ray in. Come on.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.777
- Oh, all right, Bode.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.735
You've got a bunch of broken
and displaced ribs.

05:44.779 --> 05:47.521
In order to stop the pain we're
going to have to surgically

05:47.564 --> 05:49.174
put them back into alignment
with metal plates.

05:49.218 --> 05:51.742
Is that okay?
- Okay.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.223
- All right, tell CT
we're on our way up.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.877
Let's get him ready to move.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.009
All right?
Let's go.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.968
- There are my two love birds.

06:00.011 --> 06:02.274
I got a tough one
in treatment 4. Colon cancer.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.189
Who wants it?
- I'll take it.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.627
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Can you take my stuff?

06:06.670 --> 06:09.194
- Sure.
- You all right?

06:09.238 --> 06:11.022
- Yeah.
- See ya.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.633
- See ya.

06:14.591 --> 06:15.766
Dammit.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.773
Yeah, I need to report
a stolen firearm.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.820
You know what?
Let me call you back.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.868
- Dr. Halstead.
- Good morning.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.783
- You're a hard man
to pin down.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.698
- What do you mean?

06:34.742 --> 06:38.093
- Buddy, I heard you been
skipping your sessions.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.661
- Therapy?

06:40.704 --> 06:42.967
Yeah, well, kinda busy
saving lives down here.

06:43.011 --> 06:45.666
- Listen, for what it's worth,
in my experience,

06:45.709 --> 06:48.320
this kind of trauma, you gotta
take the treatment seriously

06:48.364 --> 06:50.584
or it'll bite you in the ass.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.194
I mean,
the stories I could tell you.

06:52.237 --> 06:54.675
Drugs, alcohol, family issues.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.199
- Hey, why don't you just say
it?

06:57.242 --> 06:59.680
All right, Natalie told you
I bought a gun.

06:59.723 --> 07:02.204
Well, it's gone, okay?
It's not an issue anymore.

07:02.247 --> 07:05.163
Okay, we done?
- Will, let me remind you

07:05.207 --> 07:07.296
your therapy is not elective.

07:07.339 --> 07:10.081
Goodwin mandated it.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.083
Come on, man.

07:12.127 --> 07:14.956
I don't want to see you
lose your job.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.045
- Appreciate it.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.226
- I'm not seeing any signs
of concussion.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.054
Are you sure it was a seizure
that made you collapse?

07:26.097 --> 07:27.925
- That's what my manager
at the food co-op said

07:27.969 --> 07:29.710
but it was more
of a dizzy spell.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.407
Thinking it was
a reaction to the chemo.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.974
- All right, well,
I'm seeing in your chart

07:33.017 --> 07:34.715
that you're battling
colon cancer.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.673
Um, I'd like to send
you for a set of scans

07:36.717 --> 07:38.240
just to see what's going on.
- Scans?

07:38.283 --> 07:39.807
No, I don't want to blow
my insurance up

07:39.850 --> 07:41.330
any more than I already have.

07:41.373 --> 07:43.114
Plus, my oncologist scanned me
just last week.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.247
- Well, in that case I will
contact your oncologist

07:45.290 --> 07:46.901
directly so I can access
your records.

07:46.944 --> 07:48.163
I just need
your written consent.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.686
- No, I don't want
to bother her.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.427
I'm feeling better.

07:51.471 --> 07:55.257
I'll--I'll make an appointment
for the day after tomorrow.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.259
- Jared! Oh, baby.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.695
- Wha--what are you doing here?

07:58.739 --> 08:00.044
I thought you
were at the airport.

08:00.088 --> 08:03.178
- I was until Jason
called me in a panic.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.136
- He overreacted,
all right?

08:05.180 --> 08:07.269
You should be
on your way to Phoenix.

08:07.312 --> 08:10.359
That conference is important.
- You are more important.

08:10.402 --> 08:13.101
No way I can stay away
for a week with you like this.

08:13.144 --> 08:15.930
- This is my girlfriend, Lucy.
- How is he?

08:15.973 --> 08:17.366
- We're trying
to figure that out.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.324
- I'm telling you,
it's a reaction to the chemo,

08:19.368 --> 08:21.283
all right?
This isn't my first rodeo.

08:21.326 --> 08:24.721
- Chemo? I thought your last
cycle ended three weeks ago.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.245
- Three weeks?
- Something like that.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.683
- That seems unlikely that
would still be affecting you.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.206
Do you mind if I take a look
at your chemo port?

08:31.249 --> 08:32.990
- I opted not to get one.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.297
Nurses say my veins
are easy to access.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.951
- So what's the plan?

08:36.994 --> 08:38.866
- Well, since you don't want
any scans,

08:38.909 --> 08:40.302
please just let us
run some labs.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.434
- No.
- Jared, please.

08:42.478 --> 08:44.959
This is serious.

08:45.002 --> 08:46.917
- Okay.

08:46.961 --> 08:50.225
But just a blood test.
- Okay, I'll be back shortly.

08:55.839 --> 08:58.320
Hey, can we get a CBC, CMP,

08:58.363 --> 09:00.017
magnesium and phosphates
for Mr. Bray?

09:00.061 --> 09:01.976
- No scans?
- He won't let me.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.499
- Huh.
- Yeah, weird, right?

09:03.543 --> 09:06.328
- Yeah.
- Speaking of,

09:06.371 --> 09:08.373
did you hear about what
happened to Will's car?

09:08.417 --> 09:09.766
- Yeah, it got broken into,
right?

09:09.810 --> 09:10.985
- Yeah, but nothing was stolen.

09:11.028 --> 09:13.335
Not even a bag
with his computer in it.

09:13.378 --> 09:16.512
- That's strange.
Sounds like Will got lucky.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.820
- That's exactly
what Earl said.

09:25.129 --> 09:28.350
- Dr. Choi, I just checked in
on Mr. Kaminsky.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.482
Nurses still haven't drawn
blood or sent him up for scans.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.093
- What are they waiting for?
- Don't know.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.095
Can't get a straight answer.
Want me to do it?

09:34.138 --> 09:37.054
- No, I'll handle this.
Hey.

09:37.098 --> 09:39.187
Why is nobody filling
the orders for my patient in 5?

09:39.230 --> 09:41.145
- Got busy.
- I need that work up now.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.843
Will you do it, please?
- Sorry, gotta get

09:42.886 --> 09:45.236
stat nitro to treatment 2.
- April.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.499
Doris, I need you
to draw blood in 5.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.110
- I'm sorry, I'm on a break,
I gotta clock out.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.415
Draw Mr. Kaminsky's blood first

09:50.459 --> 09:52.853
or don't bother
clocking back in.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.813
Mags.
- Yep?

09:56.857 --> 09:58.206
- You gotta reign in
your nurses.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.990
They're dropping
the ball on my patient in 5.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.993
- Dr. Choi, we're down a nurse.
We'll get to him.

10:05.256 --> 10:07.868
- Ow!

10:07.911 --> 10:10.261
Ow!

10:10.305 --> 10:12.046
- What's wrong?
- She's hurting me.

10:12.089 --> 10:14.962
- His veins are impossible
and he keeps moving.

10:15.005 --> 10:17.965
Stay still.
- Ow! Stop stabbing me.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.794
- Doris.
- There we go.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.752
All done.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.415
- Suddenly don't know your way
around a rolling vein?

10:33.458 --> 10:36.940
- It was a hard stick.
I gotta run this to the lab.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.988
- Mo, talk to me.
What happened with Hank today?

10:41.031 --> 10:42.424
- Nothing.
He wasn't feeling good.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.079
- Monique.
- You have to ask April.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.602
- I'm asking you.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.082
We're talking about
patient care, here.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.344
This is serious, all right?

10:50.998 --> 10:52.129
Monique.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.349
- Your patient's
a child molester.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.612
- What?

10:56.656 --> 10:58.353
- He was Hank's piano teacher.

10:58.396 --> 11:01.138
He raped him
when he was a little boy.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.850
- Dr. Lanik is wondering
when his chest tube

11:16.893 --> 11:18.416
in T2 is getting set up.

11:18.460 --> 11:19.809
- You want me to do that
before or after

11:19.853 --> 11:21.637
this MVC that just came in?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.421
- How about both
at the same time?

11:23.465 --> 11:24.771
- Yeah.

11:26.816 --> 11:29.776
- Someone named Sydney Hawkins
is asking for you

11:29.819 --> 11:32.648
out in the waiting room.
Said she's a friend of yours?

11:32.692 --> 11:33.780
- Doesn't ring a bell.

11:33.823 --> 11:36.434
- I can tell her
you're too busy.

11:36.478 --> 11:41.526
No, I'll come out.

11:44.094 --> 11:47.619
Okay. Hello, Sydney?
I'm Maggie Lockwood.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.752
How can I help you?

11:49.796 --> 11:52.363
- You don't remember me,
do you?

11:52.407 --> 11:54.148
I'm Naomi's cousin.

11:54.191 --> 11:56.672
From down round 41st
and Langley?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.805
She was a year behind you
at Wendell Phillips?

11:58.848 --> 12:00.763
- Well, that was a bit ago,
yeah?

12:00.807 --> 12:02.504
But I do remember Naomi.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.811
- Well, she said if I ever
need anything

12:04.854 --> 12:06.769
at Med I should ask for you.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.684
- Okay,
so what can I do for you?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.033
- Well, just so you know,

12:10.077 --> 12:12.514
I'm not the kind of person
that gets sick a lot.

12:12.557 --> 12:15.778
- Mm-hmm.
- But I got this body pain

12:15.822 --> 12:18.781
that I just can't seem to
shake.

12:18.825 --> 12:23.873
If I had a regular doctor
I'd go see 'em but, um,

12:23.917 --> 12:26.833
if you could hook a girl up
that'd be cool.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.400
- Okay, listen,
this is an E.D.

12:29.444 --> 12:32.577
We need to prioritize
our emergencies.

12:32.621 --> 12:35.842
- Yeah, okay, well, if it's too
hectic here, I mean,

12:35.885 --> 12:38.409
you could just give me
something for the pain.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.716
- Okay, no one here is going
to be able to do that for you

12:40.760 --> 12:43.197
until you are formally
examined.

12:43.240 --> 12:46.635
So why don't you come
and take a seat over here.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.159
Go ahead.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.987
Yeah.

12:51.031 --> 12:55.818
And we'll do our best
to get to you, okay? All right.

12:55.862 --> 13:00.040
- Thank you
for stepping out to see me.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.737
- Of course.
- I appreciate it.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.218
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.

13:04.261 --> 13:07.003
Need my hand back, Sydney.
Okay.

13:09.876 --> 13:13.662
Did you take her temperature?
- 99.6. Just a bit elevated.

13:13.705 --> 13:16.926
I can bump her up the triage
list if you want.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.536
- Not necessary.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.804
- Please tell me
this wasn't your idea.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.588
- What?

13:26.631 --> 13:28.895
- You know how unethical
it is denying a patient care.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.766
Treat him like a pin cushion?

13:30.810 --> 13:33.595
I should write you all up
for what you've been doing.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.162
- Do you know what that guy did
to Hank?

13:35.205 --> 13:38.078
He molested him, Ethan.
Regularly.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.994
During their piano lessons.
- It's terrible.

13:41.037 --> 13:44.084
I know. But it's not up to us
to dole out justice.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.912
Hank should call PD.
Press charges.

13:45.955 --> 13:49.002
- He did already, but it was
Hank's word against Kaminsky's

13:49.045 --> 13:50.655
and the judge dismissed
the whole thing

13:50.699 --> 13:51.874
before it even went
to trial.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.789
Yeah, and since Kaminsky

13:53.833 --> 13:55.095
wasn't even convicted he's not

13:55.138 --> 13:57.184
registered as a sex offender.
For all we know,

13:57.227 --> 13:59.577
he's still doing this
to other little boys.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.057
- Look, I get why
this upsets you.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.930
It upsets me too.
But regardless of how awful

14:03.973 --> 14:06.889
this patient might be
we have an ethical obligation

14:06.933 --> 14:09.805
to treat
him as we would anyone else.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.112
- Fine,
but there's nothing that says

14:12.155 --> 14:13.940
we have to make
his stay a vacation.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.680
He will get
the bare minimum from me.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.946
- Look, if that's how you feel,

14:19.989 --> 14:22.818
maybe it's better
you keep away all together.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.298
- No problem.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.700
- Mr. Kaminsky's EKG
and scans are done.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.751
- Your labs came back negative.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.100
I'm not seeing
any tumors or lesions.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.668
- That's good, right?
Can I go home, now?

14:46.711 --> 14:48.975
- You'll need a follow up
with a primary care physician

14:49.018 --> 14:51.064
but it looks like you're
responding to the labetalol

14:51.107 --> 14:53.153
we gave you so hopefully
we can discharge you soon.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.024
- Thank you.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.247
- One last thing.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.945
I didn't ask you earlier
but hypertension can often

15:02.989 --> 15:04.991
be made worse by things
like work related stress.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.688
- That wouldn't apply to me

15:06.731 --> 15:08.690
because I've always
loved my job.

15:08.733 --> 15:11.736
- And what's that?
- I teach piano at my house.

15:11.780 --> 15:15.088
For over 30 years now.

15:15.131 --> 15:18.178
- You have a lot of students?
- Enough to keep me occupied.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.844
- What are you doing up here?

15:32.888 --> 15:35.151
- Trauma patient with severely
displaced rib fractures.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.023
- And you didn't page me?

15:37.066 --> 15:39.677
- Dr. Latham's held up
in surgery but he wanted me

15:39.721 --> 15:41.941
to let your know that he
reviewed your patient's chart

15:41.984 --> 15:44.856
and doesn't think Mr. Isiah's
a good candidate for surgery.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.206
The patient's HIV puts him at

15:46.249 --> 15:48.034
too high of a risk
for infection.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.601
- Plating his ribs is the only
way to treat his pain.

15:50.645 --> 15:51.994
- Dr. Latham says
you're welcome

15:52.038 --> 15:54.344
to seek another opinion.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.085
- Well, that's just great.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.786
Hey.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.006
What about you?

16:04.050 --> 16:06.226
- You're asking
for my opinion now?

16:06.269 --> 16:08.054
- Look, I know that I am
the last person

16:08.097 --> 16:10.752
that you want to help but we
shouldn't be afraid of surgery

16:10.795 --> 16:13.711
just because the patient
has HIV.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.931
- Yeah.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.020
- Here.

16:18.064 --> 16:21.154
I'm thinking three KLS titanium
plates per side,

16:21.197 --> 16:23.765
maybe four hours max.
- Okay.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.636
I'll clear my schedule
and do the surgery.

16:25.680 --> 16:29.684
- Really?
Hey. Thank you.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.948
- I'm not doing it for you,
I'm doing it for your patient.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.957
- Dr. Halstead?
- Yeah?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.872
- I was waiting
for you outside.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.396
Sorry, I was with a patient.
Let's go.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.451
- Mr. Brays labs are back.
- Thank you.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.979
So Jared, your liver enzymes
were a little higher

17:04.023 --> 17:06.286
than expected given when you
had your last chemo treatment,

17:06.329 --> 17:08.897
but everything else looks
surprisingly good.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.464
- So he's out of the woods?

17:10.507 --> 17:12.683
- Well, I still don't know
what caused his seizure

17:12.727 --> 17:16.383
but, um, for now,
your vital signs seem stable.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.473
- Listen, if I leave now,

17:19.516 --> 17:21.214
I can get to my first
presentation in time.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.867
I might just be able
to make it.

17:22.911 --> 17:23.999
You're going to leave
this late?

17:24.043 --> 17:25.218
You'll have to catch a red eye.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.915
- That's okay.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.743
I'm gonna go see if I can
reschedule my flight.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.310
- Okay.

17:30.353 --> 17:33.704
- Dr. Manning, can you pass me
my bag, please?

17:33.748 --> 17:34.879
It's right over there.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.185
- Sure.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.152
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

17:46.195 --> 17:50.156
- No problem. I'll be back
to check on you soon.

17:55.117 --> 17:58.338
- Pressure drop.

17:58.381 --> 18:02.385
- No pulse, he's in V-fib.
Terry, start compressions.

18:02.429 --> 18:05.519
Doesn't make any sense.
He was fine five minutes ago.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.521
Thought you were staying away
from this patient.

18:07.564 --> 18:10.828
- He pushed the call button.
No one else was around.

18:10.872 --> 18:13.048
- Charge to 200.
- Charged.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.441
- Clear.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.357
- Still in V-fib.
- All right,

18:17.400 --> 18:19.837
push one milligram of epi.
Charging 200 again.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.102
- Charged.
- Clear!

18:25.800 --> 18:29.064
- He's asystole.
I think he's gone.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.069
Dr. Choi?

18:45.907 --> 18:47.996
- Time of death, 14:42.

19:06.275 --> 19:09.191
- Not sure what I'm missing
here, Dr. Choi.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.759
The patient responded to
the labetalol so how'd he have

19:11.802 --> 19:13.456
a massive cardiac event
out of the blue?

19:13.500 --> 19:15.197
- I'm not sure.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.939
- I know they're pretty rare
but at first I thought

19:17.982 --> 19:21.595
maybe a pheochromocytoma was
responsible for spiking his BP

19:21.638 --> 19:24.728
but I don't see any tumors
on these scans.

19:24.772 --> 19:28.341
There must have been some other
factor at play, right?

19:31.735 --> 19:34.521
- How many doses of epi did we
give Kaminsky when he died?

19:34.564 --> 19:37.219
- According to the case notes,
one, before he went asystolic.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.873
Why?

19:44.661 --> 19:46.663
- There's four empty amps
in the trash.

19:46.707 --> 19:49.753
- Really?
How could that be?

19:52.278 --> 19:54.018
- Follow the body down
to the morgue, find Dr. Shore,

19:54.062 --> 19:55.890
and ask her if she could
tell me how much epinephrine

19:55.933 --> 19:57.544
Kaminsky had in his system
when he died.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.937
- Okay.
- And ask her

19:59.981 --> 20:02.549
to keep it off the books.
- Off the books?

20:02.592 --> 20:03.724
- Just do it.

20:30.011 --> 20:33.014
- All right,
that does it for this side.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.668
Let's close him up
and reposition him,

20:34.711 --> 20:37.279
re-prep and re-drip.
- You got it.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.853
- His splintering was much more
extensive than I thought

20:45.896 --> 20:47.855
from the scans
so you made the right call.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.509
- Well, so far so good.

20:51.075 --> 20:55.297
- So a patient of mine sent
over a bottle of Yamazaki 12

20:55.341 --> 20:56.907
as a thank you
for triple bypass.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.562
Perhaps after we're done
we could put a dent in it?

20:59.606 --> 21:02.304
- Look, Ava--
- One drink.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.567
Connor,
what are you so afraid of?

21:04.611 --> 21:08.310
- Why did you agree
to do the surgery?

21:08.354 --> 21:10.486
You trying to fix things
between us?

21:12.445 --> 21:13.924
- So what if I was?

21:13.968 --> 21:16.579
- Then this is not the time
or the place.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.712
- I still have feelings
for you, Connor.

21:22.368 --> 21:25.936
Let me know when the team's
ready to restart.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.635
- You know what I find most
bewildering about all this?

21:28.678 --> 21:30.593
You've somehow
convinced yourself

21:30.637 --> 21:32.595
that you're the victim
here.

21:39.036 --> 21:41.691
- Dr. Manning, Dr. Manning,
come quick.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.480
- I was just about to leave
when this happened.

21:47.523 --> 21:50.396
- Jared, can you talk to me?

21:50.439 --> 21:52.572
Push 2 of Ativan, stat!

21:52.615 --> 21:54.791
- What's going on?
- He's having a seizure.

21:56.750 --> 21:57.968
- Ativan's in.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.927
- Jared,
can you take a deep breath?

22:01.494 --> 22:03.626
- Baby, can you hear me?

22:09.676 --> 22:11.373
- What happened?

22:11.417 --> 22:13.027
- You just had your second
seizure today.

22:13.070 --> 22:16.639
Jared, you need to get
a CAT scan immediately.

22:16.683 --> 22:19.599
- No, no, I'm fine.
- Jared.

22:19.642 --> 22:23.080
- I'm fine, really.

22:23.124 --> 22:27.041
Don't--don't let this stop
you catching your flight.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.086
You should go.
- Are you crazy?

22:29.130 --> 22:31.045
I'm not leaving you now.

22:31.088 --> 22:32.481
- What about your job?

22:32.525 --> 22:34.875
- None of that matters
right now.

22:34.918 --> 22:37.486
I'm not leaving your side
until you're better.

22:49.063 --> 22:51.587
- Hey,
how's your patient doing?

22:51.631 --> 22:54.503
- I'm not sure yet.
Hey, where'd you go?

22:54.547 --> 22:56.113
I was looking for you,
I couldn't find you.

22:56.157 --> 22:59.116
- Well, I had to call
the insurance company.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.640
- But I saw you talking
with a cop.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.511
- Well, yeah,
that was part of it.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.948
I had to file a whole police
report for the insurance claim.

23:04.992 --> 23:07.951
- Why would you file
a police report?

23:07.995 --> 23:12.565
- Was something stolen?
- Natalie, for the last time,

23:12.608 --> 23:14.088
nothing was stolen.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.878
- Hey, I just planted a
patient in treatment 3 for you.

23:21.922 --> 23:24.098
- Sydney, right? I was just
about to head in there.

23:24.141 --> 23:25.447
- All right.

23:27.275 --> 23:29.973
Did I hear something about her
being a friend of yours?

23:30.017 --> 23:31.192
- She's not a friend of mine.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.543
- Okay.

23:34.587 --> 23:35.936
- Hey, sorry.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.942
It's just I know something
about Sydney.

23:41.985 --> 23:44.248
She has a reputation of being
a bit of a grifter.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.468
Heard she got arrested
for solicitation last year.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.688
I have sympathy for the girl
but quite possibly

23:48.731 --> 23:50.080
she's just
here to score some pills.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.647
- Yeah, good to know.
I'll proceed accordingly.

23:51.691 --> 23:52.909
- Yeah.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.653
- So you think Jared's lying
to you?

23:57.697 --> 23:59.960
- Yes.
- Wow.

24:00.003 --> 24:02.484
That's a pretty serious
accusation.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.225
- His story just doesn't
add up.

24:04.268 --> 24:07.271
He won't show me his scans,
he doesn't have a chemo port,

24:07.315 --> 24:10.187
and both his seizures today
timed out perfectly

24:10.231 --> 24:12.538
to stop his girlfriend from
going on her business trip.

24:12.581 --> 24:15.279
- Faking a cancer diagnoses
for two years

24:15.323 --> 24:17.586
would take
unbelievable commitment,

24:17.630 --> 24:19.545
and also, how do you explain
the hair loss

24:19.588 --> 24:21.111
and other physical symptoms.

24:21.155 --> 24:24.506
- Well, I saw a Ziplock full
of green pellets in his bag.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.508
They looked just like
the rat poison

24:26.552 --> 24:28.510
that my handyman
uses in the basement.

24:28.554 --> 24:32.122
If Jared is ingesting a small
dose of a toxin like arsenic,

24:32.166 --> 24:35.996
it could easily mimic
the side effects of chemo.

24:36.039 --> 24:38.520
- Huh.
- I think he's harming himself

24:38.564 --> 24:41.131
and he needs to be evaluated.

24:41.175 --> 24:44.178
- Okay.
I will talk to him.

24:44.221 --> 24:45.832
- Thank you.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.318
- Another here.

24:57.147 --> 25:01.978
One last fracture here,

25:02.022 --> 25:03.937
20 cc's, quarter-percent
Marcaine, hand them to me.

25:03.980 --> 25:06.243
- Make that to me, Beth.

25:06.287 --> 25:07.897
You want to do everything
yourself?

25:07.941 --> 25:09.986
I have the better angle.
- Not for the incision.

25:10.030 --> 25:12.641
- Okay, fine.
Give me the Marcaine.

25:13.947 --> 25:16.166
- Knife to me.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.144
- Ow!
- She's cut.

25:38.885 --> 25:41.191
- The patient's HIV positive.

25:41.235 --> 25:42.802
- Ava?

25:50.636 --> 25:52.768
- It just nicked me.
It barely broke the skin.

25:52.812 --> 25:54.335
I doused it with Betadine.

25:54.378 --> 25:55.379
- Doesn't matter.
Hospital protocol.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.207
- She's being sidelined?

25:57.251 --> 26:00.602
- Because the patient is HIV
positive you need to be seen

26:00.646 --> 26:02.430
in the
infectious disease clinic,

26:02.473 --> 26:06.303
and start taking
antiretrovirals immediately.

26:06.347 --> 26:09.611
Now the medication can cause
extreme nausea

26:09.655 --> 26:11.744
so I want you
off surgical rotation,

26:11.787 --> 26:15.225
just for a few days,
until you acclimate.

26:15.269 --> 26:16.705
- And if I end up contracting
the virus,

26:16.749 --> 26:18.489
what happens to my career?

26:18.533 --> 26:20.535
- There is such a small chance
of that happening,

26:20.579 --> 26:23.277
you saw the patient's chart,
he has a low viral load.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.366
- Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.629
Just start taking the meds
right away

26:27.673 --> 26:31.459
and hopefully there won't be
anything to worry about, okay?

26:33.635 --> 26:36.203
- Ava, I am so sorry.
I don't even know what to say.

26:36.246 --> 26:37.639
- It's not your fault.
I was the one who reached

26:37.683 --> 26:39.423
for the tray
like some idiot resident.

26:39.467 --> 26:41.338
- Well, let me at least
take a look at your hand.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.602
- No, it's okay.
I'll be fine, Connor.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.259
- Ethan it's freezing.
Why'd you bring me up here?

26:49.303 --> 26:51.610
- I got a preliminary report
back from pathology

26:51.653 --> 26:53.437
and there was evidence
Paul Kaminsky had high levels

26:53.481 --> 26:55.265
of epinephrine in his blood
when he died.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.877
- So?
- So I'm not sure he died

26:57.920 --> 26:59.835
purely of natural causes
and I need you to help me

26:59.879 --> 27:01.750
understand what happened.
- Understand?

27:01.794 --> 27:04.231
What--are you accusing me
of something?

27:04.274 --> 27:07.451
- We pushed one amp of epi
when he coded, right?

27:07.495 --> 27:09.628
April, I found four empty
amps altogether

27:09.671 --> 27:11.281
in the trash afterwards.

27:11.325 --> 27:13.196
I can't seem to account
for the other three.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.198
- Maybe another patient
coded in that room

27:15.242 --> 27:16.504
right before Kaminsky.
- Nothing was logged.

27:16.547 --> 27:17.810
- Maybe they forgot to log it.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.681
I don't see what
this has to do with me.

27:19.725 --> 27:22.902
- You were in Kaminsky's room
just before he crashed.

27:24.512 --> 27:26.645
- You think I killed him?
- I'm just trying to understand

27:26.688 --> 27:28.647
how so much epinephrine
got into his system.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.605
- I don't believe this.
- April, please.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.259
Just tell me what
you were doing in that room.

27:32.302 --> 27:34.696
- He was dehydrated.
I gave him a glass of water.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.350
- So suddenly you're
Florence Nightingale

27:36.393 --> 27:37.960
to this guy?
- I think we're done.

27:38.004 --> 27:41.572
- April, April, please, just--
you gotta be straight with me.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.313
I'm trying to protect you from
getting in any trouble here.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.228
- Really?

27:45.272 --> 27:47.491
'Cause that's not what it
feels like you're trying to do.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.768
- So?
- It's hard to say.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.900
I mean, if we're seriously
thinking Munchausen here

28:04.944 --> 28:07.686
it's a diagnosis of exclusion
and I would just need

28:07.729 --> 28:09.688
a lot more time to eliminate
the entire differential.

28:09.731 --> 28:10.950
- Well, we don't have more
time.

28:10.993 --> 28:12.473
He wants to be
discharged now.

28:12.516 --> 28:13.822
- Nat, I understand.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.694
- He needs to be put on a psych
hold.

28:15.737 --> 28:18.261
Not only is he poisoning
himself but he is controlling

28:18.305 --> 28:20.002
every aspect of his
girlfriend's life.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.570
- Possibly, but he also could
be a very sick guy

28:22.613 --> 28:23.876
clinging to his girlfriend

28:23.919 --> 28:25.704
during a traumatic period
in his life.

28:25.747 --> 28:27.662
It all comes down to whether
we're willing to risk

28:27.706 --> 28:30.970
locking up a legitimately ill
cancer patient on a hunch.

28:32.885 --> 28:34.669
And I'm just not there yet.
- But--

28:34.713 --> 28:36.671
- I'm sorry, Nat.
At this point we just don't

28:36.715 --> 28:38.978
have enough information
to do anything but let him go.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.287
- 1 and 2,
you take this one.

28:44.331 --> 28:45.332
- Maggie?
- Yup?

28:45.375 --> 28:46.333
- Dr. Halstead needs you

28:46.376 --> 28:47.464
to page renal, stat.

28:47.508 --> 28:49.423
- Got it. Where to?

28:49.466 --> 28:52.295
- Treatment 3, Sydney Hawkins.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.863
- Sydney?

28:54.907 --> 28:56.517
- Bolus another liter of
saline.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.911
- What's going on?
- She's in septic shock.

28:58.954 --> 29:00.390
- Wait, wait,
she was fine a minute ago.

29:00.434 --> 29:01.609
- Temp spiked out of nowhere,

29:01.652 --> 29:03.306
BP went in the tank.

29:03.350 --> 29:04.786
- What?
- Systolic's down to 89.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.354
- You can start an external
jugular, stat.

29:07.397 --> 29:09.008
- Here's a kit.
- Maggie.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.836
You gotta step back.

29:16.493 --> 29:18.452
- Did we get the infection
in time?

29:19.932 --> 29:21.455
- I don't know.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.296
- Lucy? You okay?

29:37.863 --> 29:41.736
What's wrong?
- My boss just fired me.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.695
- What? Why?

29:44.739 --> 29:47.481
- Because I missed
that conference.

29:47.524 --> 29:49.831
They said they can no longer
handle

29:49.875 --> 29:52.051
the unpredictability
of my personal life.

29:54.009 --> 29:56.925
And this is the second job
I've lost in a year.

29:56.969 --> 29:59.972
- I am so sorry.
- It's not fair.

30:00.015 --> 30:03.453
It's really hard trying to take
care of a loved one

30:03.497 --> 30:05.368
going through
something like this.

30:05.412 --> 30:06.935
- I can imagine that going to
the chemo treatments alone

30:06.979 --> 30:09.633
is like a full time job.

30:09.677 --> 30:12.636
- He actually doesn't let me
go to chemo with him.

30:12.680 --> 30:15.857
- Really?
Why?

30:15.901 --> 30:17.598
- Probably just trying
to protect me.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.818
Maybe he thinks it'll
stress me out too much.

30:23.778 --> 30:26.955
- Hey, Dr. Manning.
When can I get out of here?

30:26.999 --> 30:28.870
- I'm sorry, Jared,
but I can't officially

30:28.914 --> 30:30.567
discharge you
without a CAT scan.

30:30.611 --> 30:33.657
- Then I'll sign out
against medical advice.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.616
- If that's what you wanna do

30:35.659 --> 30:37.052
but you're still pretty
dehydrated

30:37.096 --> 30:39.750
so I would like to hang
one more liter of fluid,

30:39.794 --> 30:42.579
and then we will
get you on your way.

30:44.538 --> 30:47.628
Sorry.

30:47.671 --> 30:50.718
- What are you doing?
- Uh...

30:53.112 --> 30:54.548
Here you go.

30:56.767 --> 30:58.160
We'll get you discharged soon.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.516
You wanted proof?
Here are the pellets.

31:08.562 --> 31:11.521
- Don't tell me you just took
those right out of Jared's bag.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.393
- Given the circumstances
I felt that I had to.

31:13.436 --> 31:14.829
- Dr. Manning, I don't need to
tell you

31:14.873 --> 31:16.657
that that's a very
serious transgression.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.485
- His girlfriend deserves to
know the truth.

31:18.528 --> 31:20.139
I'm going to
the lab to have these analyzed.

31:28.103 --> 31:31.150
- Have a seat, please.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.326
- The lab tested
the pellets you took.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.676
- They came back positive,
didn't they?

31:35.719 --> 31:39.288
- Yes, for high levels
of spirulina.

31:39.332 --> 31:40.942
- What?

31:40.986 --> 31:44.946
- It's a vitamin supplement.
Not arsenic.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.296
- Jared realized you were
suspicious

31:47.340 --> 31:51.170
so he gave us permission to
access his medical records.

31:51.213 --> 31:55.348
His oncologist at East Mercy
just emailed this over.

31:55.391 --> 31:59.004
All of Jared's appointments,
prescriptions,

31:59.047 --> 32:02.268
chemo treatments,
it's all there, including scans

32:02.311 --> 32:05.097
of the stage three malignant
tumor in his colon.

32:05.140 --> 32:06.881
- You were absolutely right
about one thing:

32:06.925 --> 32:08.796
He was hiding something.

32:08.839 --> 32:11.930
The severity of his cancer.

32:11.973 --> 32:15.281
His prognosis is not good.
- I don't know what to say.

32:15.324 --> 32:16.978
This is awful.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.981
- You're an excellent
physician, Dr. Manning,

32:20.025 --> 32:22.462
I realize you've been through
a lot lately

32:22.505 --> 32:25.334
and against my better
judgment,

32:25.378 --> 32:27.946
I'm going to bat
for you on this,

32:27.989 --> 32:29.991
but it can't happen again.

32:39.044 --> 32:42.177
- This is so insane,
Dr. Charles.

32:42.221 --> 32:44.005
I don't know what
I was thinking.

32:46.486 --> 32:49.358
- When I ask myself that
question, the answer usually

32:49.402 --> 32:51.317
ends up having something to do
with me,

32:51.360 --> 32:54.276
you know,
something going on in my life.

32:54.320 --> 32:58.019
Could you have been projecting
onto Lucy

32:58.063 --> 33:00.500
something that might
be true for you?

33:02.284 --> 33:03.938
- I don't know.

33:15.210 --> 33:18.344
- What I suspected. Sepsis.

33:18.387 --> 33:20.911
Yeah, from the little history I
got from her I'm guessing

33:20.955 --> 33:23.131
this started as a kidney
or urinary tract infection.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.396
I should have known
it was serious.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.050
I could have bumped Sydney
up the list.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.399
- Oh, come on, Maggie.
No way you could have

33:30.443 --> 33:32.184
anticipated her being septic.

33:32.227 --> 33:35.056
- What's your prognosis?
She gonna have a full recovery?

33:35.100 --> 33:36.536
- She's in acute renal failure.

33:36.579 --> 33:38.538
We'll take her up to the ICU

33:38.581 --> 33:40.975
and start her on dialysis right
away but there's a good chance

33:41.019 --> 33:43.238
her kidneys are shot and she'll
need a transplant.

33:44.848 --> 33:46.415
- Yeah.

34:08.481 --> 34:11.440
- Maggie.
- Sydney.

34:13.138 --> 34:16.271
How're you doing?
Can I get you anything?

34:16.315 --> 34:18.926
- I thought I just had the flu.

34:20.971 --> 34:23.800
- Sydney, I need you to know
how sorry I am.

34:23.844 --> 34:26.803
- Oh, no.

34:26.847 --> 34:29.241
I can't stop thinking about how
if I wouldn't

34:29.284 --> 34:32.505
have come in
today I would've been dead.

34:32.548 --> 34:35.247
I'm grateful for you, Maggie.

34:36.204 --> 34:39.120
Least I know I'm in good hands.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.612
- Connor?

34:52.655 --> 34:54.266
- I thought that you would want
to know

34:54.309 --> 34:56.442
that Bode's surgery
was successful.

34:56.485 --> 34:59.314
He's already up and pain free.

34:59.358 --> 35:03.318
- Good, I'm glad.
Come in.

35:06.365 --> 35:10.282
- I also wanted
to bring you this.

35:10.325 --> 35:13.154
- Yamazaki 18?
- I figured the least

35:13.198 --> 35:14.982
I could do was help you
numb the pain.

35:15.025 --> 35:18.290
- Thank you. Sadly, can't have
any with my meds, doctor.

35:18.333 --> 35:21.597
- Right, yeah, uh, well,
maybe we can celebrate

35:21.641 --> 35:23.077
when you get the "all clear".

35:23.121 --> 35:24.296
- Well, you can have some,
right?

35:24.339 --> 35:25.601
You take it neat?

35:25.645 --> 35:27.560
- I'm afraid I'm still on call.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.257
Actually, I have to get back
to Med.

35:29.301 --> 35:32.042
- Oh, sure.

35:34.349 --> 35:37.352
- Good night.
- Good night.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.103
- Heads up, Choi.
We're reviewing

35:49.147 --> 35:50.409
the Kaminsky case
for tomorrow's M&M.

35:50.452 --> 35:52.411
- Okay.
- I see you didn't put down

35:52.454 --> 35:54.195
a cause of death, yet.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.371
Something holding that up
or is that just an oversight?

35:58.982 --> 36:02.029
- Sorry, I just need
to check something first.

36:02.072 --> 36:04.292
- I need your John Hancock
before the end of the shift.

36:04.336 --> 36:05.902
- You'll have it.

36:10.080 --> 36:13.214
- Well, if something caused
this guy's epinephrine levels

36:13.258 --> 36:15.042
to spike it's going to be on
the adrenals

36:15.085 --> 36:18.263
but I'm not seeing
anything.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.352
- Could you give them a closer
look?

36:20.395 --> 36:23.224
Something's gotta be there,
I know it.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.531
- I'm not supposed to be doing
this without a formal inquiry.

36:25.574 --> 36:28.664
- I know, believe me.

36:28.708 --> 36:30.927
You're doing me a huge favor,
Nina.

36:32.407 --> 36:33.974
- You're gonna owe me
for this one.

36:35.976 --> 36:38.108
All right, let's see.

36:39.501 --> 36:43.462
Well, I'll be darned. Look.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.290
- - I can't see anything.

36:52.384 --> 36:56.214
There's your culprit.
Looks like a pheochromocytoma.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.564
It's too small to show up
on the scans.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.087
Must have been what caused the
high levels

37:00.130 --> 37:01.436
of epinephrine
in this guy's system.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.004
- So he died purely
of natural causes.

37:04.047 --> 37:06.615
- Sure did.
- Thank you.

37:08.661 --> 37:11.272
You're the best.

37:19.628 --> 37:22.370
- Dr. Rhodes, hey,
how's Dr. Bekker?

37:22.414 --> 37:25.417
- She's hanging in there.
- I still can't believe it.

37:25.460 --> 37:28.071
She's usually the most careful
surgeon at Med.

37:28.115 --> 37:31.597
Just not like her.
Not at all.

37:31.640 --> 37:35.296
Anyway, good night.
- Yeah, good night.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.217
- What's this?

37:43.261 --> 37:45.437
- This is what killed
Paul Kaminsky.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.439
An adrenal tumor.

37:47.482 --> 37:50.442
- Okay.

37:50.485 --> 37:55.142
- I am so sorry, April.
That was wrong of me.

37:55.185 --> 37:57.449
- No kidding.
- If I'm being honest

37:57.492 --> 38:00.713
with myself I think I was hurt

38:00.756 --> 38:03.281
that you didn't trust me enough
to read me in.

38:03.324 --> 38:08.242
And then I started
to mistrust you as well.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.766
- Well, maybe I shouldn't have
cut you out.

38:17.207 --> 38:20.776
- It's not easy working so
closely

38:20.820 --> 38:24.432
with someone
you've been involved with.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.611
But I'd like to think we can
get past that

38:29.655 --> 38:33.311
and still be friends.

38:34.747 --> 38:36.357
- I don't know, Ethan.

38:36.401 --> 38:39.142
You thought
I could kill a patient.

38:39.186 --> 38:41.493
Is that someone I really want
as a friend?

38:56.421 --> 39:00.338
- I heard about what happened.
You okay?

39:00.381 --> 39:03.428
- What was stolen
from your car today?

39:03.471 --> 39:05.212
- Tell me the truth.

39:05.255 --> 39:06.822
- Natalie, I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:06.866 --> 39:10.217
- All day I have been feeling
like everything is a lie.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.828
It's the same feeling I had
on our wedding day.

39:12.872 --> 39:14.395
Just tell me the truth.

39:14.439 --> 39:17.224
What was stolen
from your car today?

39:22.490 --> 39:25.319
- My gun.
- Your gun?

39:25.363 --> 39:28.670
You swore to me it was gone.
- I went to turn it in.

39:28.714 --> 39:31.281
I did. I just needed more time.

39:31.325 --> 39:33.153
- Unbelievable.

39:35.503 --> 39:36.678
- I didn't know
how to tell you.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.811
- I trusted you.

39:38.854 --> 39:40.682
- You have every right to be
angry with me.

39:40.726 --> 39:44.338
- No, I don't want to hear
any more lies.

39:48.342 --> 39:51.606
- Natalie.
- It's over.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.261
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

39:59.484 --> 40:00.615
- Good bye, Will.
