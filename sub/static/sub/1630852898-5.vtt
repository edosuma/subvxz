WEBVTT

00:15.033 --> 00:16.033
Strap in, people.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.233
You know the chink in my armour.
My Achilles’ heel.

00:29.266 --> 00:31.100
Delicious cheese.
Delicious cheese.

00:31.133 --> 00:32.367
The delicious cheese sandwich!

00:32.400 --> 00:33.700
Sandwiches. Sandwiches. Delicious.

00:33.734 --> 00:34.700
Delicious cheese sandwich!

00:34.734 --> 00:36.934
Jon is holding on for dear life.

00:36.967 --> 00:37.934
He’s got a yellow
card, doesn’t he?

00:37.967 --> 00:39.200
Yeah, he does have a yellow.

00:39.233 --> 00:46.000
It’s the delicious
cheese sandwich!

00:46.033 --> 00:47.066
Done.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.400
And, scene.

00:48.433 --> 00:50.900
Atta boy Jon, wow!

00:50.934 --> 00:53.100
Uh... cheque please?

00:56.767 --> 01:00.433
What would be the
best meal to go with that?

01:00.467 --> 01:03.333
Don’t think about it too hard.
You’re barely hanging on.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.700
Oh my god.

01:08.734 --> 01:11.633
I could hear laughter
from the other room

01:11.667 --> 01:13.133
so I felt good that

01:13.166 --> 01:15.200
the people who had already
been eliminated

01:15.233 --> 01:16.767
for being easy laughs
were laughing.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.700
But the people I was aiming
for, it didn’t seem to work.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.800
Well done.
That almost got me.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.133
Almost is not good enough.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.567
Uh oh.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.467
Oh.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.467
What the hell is that?

01:39.500 --> 01:44.233
I am the Phantom of the Studio.

01:44.266 --> 01:47.333
The situation was already
pretty absurd at this point

01:47.367 --> 01:51.100
and then, the, uh, Phantom
of the Studio comes out.

01:51.133 --> 01:54.066
Which I was like, okay, okay.

01:54.100 --> 01:57.333
I’ve been watching each
and every one of you.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.767
Watching you work.
Watching you play.

02:01.734 --> 02:03.567
This shot...

02:03.600 --> 02:05.033
What the fuck is this?

02:05.066 --> 02:06.500
You know what this
reminds me of?

02:06.533 --> 02:08.000
The interactive theatre.

02:09.333 --> 02:11.133
I, I love this.

02:11.166 --> 02:15.300
Tom. Unbreakable.
So far.

02:15.333 --> 02:17.567
They try over and over again.

02:17.600 --> 02:22.700
Unable to crack
the man in here, you see.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.700
- And over here, Jon!
- Keep going. Keep going.

02:28.734 --> 02:31.333
Oh, I’ll be back.
I’ll be back for much more.

02:31.367 --> 02:33.266
See ya at the wrap party.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.667
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

02:37.133 --> 02:38.600
Jon?

02:38.633 --> 02:40.133
Mmm hmm.

02:40.166 --> 02:42.467
Constantly unsure what
will happen next.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.033
Will it be a caw-caw!

02:45.066 --> 02:46.934
That sets him off?

02:46.967 --> 02:49.500
You’ve got to admire
the commitment,

02:49.533 --> 02:51.934
but I don’t understand
what’s happening.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.433
Well, I have something for you.

02:53.467 --> 02:55.000
- Mmm.
- Uh oh.

02:55.033 --> 02:57.033
I have something I want
to challenge you with.

02:57.066 --> 02:58.600
Should someone tell him he’s
got something on his face?

03:02.166 --> 03:06.633
I present to you
the "Wheel of Trauma".

03:06.667 --> 03:08.100
Ooh.

03:08.133 --> 03:09.367
Take a spin of the wheel.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.300
I want to see
what your trauma is.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.567
Take that trauma
and perform

03:14.600 --> 03:17.033
that pain for this audience.

03:17.066 --> 03:20.066
Brandon... enter the arena.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.200
Okay.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.100
"Shit pants
on first date."

03:28.133 --> 03:30.300
Jon, you’ve been there!

03:30.333 --> 03:31.800
Oh my God, yes.

03:31.834 --> 03:32.967
Who hasn’t?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.066
I shit my pants
thirty seconds ago.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.233
The stage is yours, use it.

03:39.266 --> 03:44.000
This is such a fun date.

03:44.033 --> 03:46.667
Uh oh.
Oh, oh.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.433
Act harder!

03:48.467 --> 03:51.967
Ah. I, I’m shitting.
I’m, I’m shitting.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.500
No one ever announces that
they’re shitting like that.

03:54.533 --> 03:55.700
I can’t stop shitting.

03:55.734 --> 03:57.600
Why are you shitting?
Tell us!

03:57.633 --> 03:59.667
’Cause my dad didn’t love me.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.433
Ah. Ah. Ah.

04:02.467 --> 04:03.700
And, scene.

04:03.734 --> 04:05.500
That was like
a really edgy Hallmark.

04:09.467 --> 04:10.467
Woo!

04:10.500 --> 04:12.367
I gave quite the performance.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.467
Okay. Oh, maybe I didn’t but,
you know what? I tried, okay?

04:16.500 --> 04:19.100
Let’s see if a new game
will break these guys.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.533
Hello?

04:24.567 --> 04:27.066
Ask everybody to get
into a circle

04:27.100 --> 04:29.700
and you’re gonna take
turns speaking one at a time

04:29.734 --> 04:32.000
but only in questions.

04:32.033 --> 04:34.066
I think it’s good news.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.633
If anyone speaks
in anything

04:35.667 --> 04:38.033
other than a question they
gotta sit out in shame.

04:38.066 --> 04:39.333
Okay.

04:39.367 --> 04:41.000
Alright everyone
get into a circle.

04:41.033 --> 04:42.333
- Okay.
- Get into a circle?

04:42.367 --> 04:44.266
- Okay.
- Into a circle.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.934
We’re gonna do a game, you may
have seen on an improv show,

04:46.967 --> 04:49.233
that you know, made me famous.

04:49.266 --> 04:51.400
Oh yeah, of course!
I’m explaining the rules to him?

04:53.200 --> 04:54.600
It’s like "So this is what
you’re gonna do."

04:54.633 --> 04:56.700
Yeah. Colin, look Colin,
just listen. Just listen.

04:56.734 --> 04:58.800
So you can only
talk in questions.

04:58.834 --> 05:02.000
I’ll start. Did you see
the size of the waves?

05:02.033 --> 05:05.333
Did you see the sun?

05:05.367 --> 05:09.166
I would... imagine...

05:09.200 --> 05:13.033
uh... that I would...know
how to... ask a question?

05:13.066 --> 05:16.100
Yeah. I feel you kinda lost
the whole question thing there.

05:16.133 --> 05:17.500
Yeah, you did not
get the question.

05:17.533 --> 05:20.066
Never at any point
was there a question.

05:22.166 --> 05:23.934
Alright, how ’bout
a new location?

05:23.967 --> 05:25.700
A, uh, rocket launch?

05:25.734 --> 05:28.200
So you answer the question
with another question

05:28.233 --> 05:29.367
and pass that question to...

05:29.400 --> 05:30.300
Yeah. And you try
to keep that...

05:30.333 --> 05:31.700
...to the next person.

05:31.734 --> 05:33.000
Like it’s all happening
in the same place...

05:33.033 --> 05:34.000
- Okay.
- ...at the same time.

05:34.033 --> 05:37.400
Hey, is this the rocket launch?

05:37.433 --> 05:39.266
I wonder if anyone’s gonna die.

05:41.266 --> 05:43.734
Um, that’s not
really a question.

05:43.767 --> 05:45.700
Oh my God.

05:45.734 --> 05:48.233
Apparently, I don’t know
what a question is.

05:48.266 --> 05:50.100
Was that a question?

05:50.133 --> 05:51.567
No, this is a question.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.467
"This is a question"
is not a question.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.266
But "was that a question?"
is a question?

05:56.300 --> 05:58.100
I don’t know what a question is.

05:58.133 --> 06:01.467
Jon fucked up.
That’s him out.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.033
- Okay. I’ve got a question.
- Alright.

06:03.066 --> 06:04.400
Are we still
at a rocket launch?

06:04.433 --> 06:05.367
- Still a rocket launch.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.367
Okay. Slight revision.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.300
Okay.

06:08.333 --> 06:12.400
Is this the rocket launch or
are you just happy to see me?

06:13.967 --> 06:16.233
I’ve been here forever.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.300
Is that really a question?

06:21.333 --> 06:22.700
That’s a statement.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.567
Let’s see if we can actually
get more than two sentences out.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.567
Yeah. Okay.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.133
Alright so, how about this?

06:30.166 --> 06:31.633
Does the question have to...

06:31.667 --> 06:33.367
The next question has to
relate to the first question?

06:33.400 --> 06:35.000
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, it would help. Yeah.

06:35.033 --> 06:36.667
This is a Second City Masterclass.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.133
Yeah, exactly!

06:38.166 --> 06:39.567
You know he’s gonna
bill production.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.200
Doctor, do you think we can
save the patient?

06:43.233 --> 06:46.266
Nurse, do you have
the adrenaline cc’s?

06:53.233 --> 06:56.333
Do you have the adrenaline cc’s?

06:56.367 --> 07:00.200
Why did you hire this nurse?

07:00.233 --> 07:02.033
Oh, he smiled! He smiled!

07:02.066 --> 07:04.133
Oh, he smiled!

07:05.367 --> 07:07.266
- Oh!
- Oh!

07:11.533 --> 07:12.934
Oh boy.

07:12.967 --> 07:15.600
Uh oh. Who’s gone?

07:15.633 --> 07:16.900
Well, let’s find out.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.433
Hi, everybody!

07:20.467 --> 07:22.266
Alright.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.033
Who is it?
Who is it?

07:24.066 --> 07:27.967
So, uh, let’s take a look
at the freakin’ TV.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.166
Is it me?

07:31.300 --> 07:33.967
Nurse, do you have
the adrenaline cc’s?

07:35.100 --> 07:38.734
Oh.

07:38.767 --> 07:40.567
Do you have the adrenaline cc’s?

07:46.400 --> 07:48.567
Oh! Oh!

07:48.600 --> 07:50.400
I think it was kind
of a relief to laugh.

07:50.433 --> 07:52.967
I was just in
the moment and, uh...

07:53.000 --> 07:55.667
I guess I let my guard down
a little bit there.

07:57.066 --> 07:59.000
Yellow card!
You don’t keep it.

07:59.033 --> 08:00.367
Oh, I don’t keep it.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.233
- Nobody keeps these but me.
- Oh, okay.

08:01.266 --> 08:02.767
Aww.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.867
I don’t want to go over this
every time I go in here!

08:06.333 --> 08:08.033
We’re down to the
wire here.

08:08.066 --> 08:09.300
Oh my God.

08:12.433 --> 08:13.500
Phew, shit.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.400
Never thought this
would happen but

08:17.433 --> 08:19.233
Tom Green gets a yellow card.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.667
Now everyone except Brandon

08:21.700 --> 08:25.033
is one laugh away from
utter failure and disgrace.

08:25.066 --> 08:26.667
No fucking pressure!

08:32.533 --> 08:33.800
Yeah.

08:43.033 --> 08:45.367
Wow. That was
Gordon Lightfoot, right?

08:45.400 --> 08:46.667
Thank you, yeah absolutely.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.300
That’s funny.

08:48.333 --> 08:50.934
Yeah, that was
"Edmund Fitzgerald", yeah.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.900
So if we were to start
the movie Titanic right now,

08:57.934 --> 09:00.100
it would still take like
an hour and a half

09:00.133 --> 09:02.767
for the iceberg to hit.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.967
And we are nowhere near
the people starting to die

09:06.000 --> 09:08.633
and like jumping out of the,
plop, plop, plop, like that.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.133
What’s the porn
version of Titanic?

09:12.000 --> 09:15.266
It’s called Titanic Cock.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.066
Mmm.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.533
That’s like a little...

09:18.567 --> 09:20.700
It’s a little lazy but
sometimes they get lazy.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.633
It’s called Giant Cock.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.266
Oh, okay. I mean.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.033
I’ll just go to the bathroom.
I’ll be right back.

09:32.967 --> 09:35.000
Whew. Oh boy.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.667
Hour four.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.467
Your brain, you just,
it shorts a little bit.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.266
You’re like, oh well,
we haven’t laughed so far

09:41.300 --> 09:43.934
so we’re, we’re,
we’re good

09:43.967 --> 09:47.033
but no, no, no,
no, no, you’re not good!

09:47.066 --> 09:49.400
Ah.

09:49.433 --> 09:51.567
Jon, you alright buddy?

09:51.600 --> 09:53.533
- You alright?
- Mmm hmm.

09:53.567 --> 09:54.967
As I looked around...

09:55.000 --> 09:57.333
I thought, okay,
I think I can get Jon.

09:57.367 --> 10:00.967
And then I thought
hey, this might be funny.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.133
The sound of a
penguin being penetrated.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.600
I’m not proud of this.

10:10.633 --> 10:13.100
Oh, hey Jon, did I show you
my penguin having sex?

10:13.133 --> 10:14.400
Yeah. Yeah.

10:14.433 --> 10:16.066
No.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.467
Imagine they’re really
close to the ground.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.100
Yeah.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.967
Jon is going to break so big!

10:31.367 --> 10:34.066
Oh, Jon’s on the fucking brink.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.367
That a boy, Colin, get him.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.800
And then the fish.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Fuck you!

10:48.233 --> 10:50.433
That’s a laugh.
That’s a laugh!

10:50.467 --> 10:52.100
Oh!

10:52.133 --> 10:56.033
Oh! Of all the things.

10:56.066 --> 10:57.633
People think I’m a nice guy,

10:57.667 --> 11:01.533
but I have levels of
horrific depravity in me.

11:01.567 --> 11:04.000
I probably need some therapy.

11:08.066 --> 11:10.333
Hi, everybody! Alright.

11:10.367 --> 11:12.467
That didn’t fucking
take very long.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.367
You guys really missed me, eh?

11:13.400 --> 11:15.166
Oh, what did I miss?

11:15.200 --> 11:18.433
So, uh, everybody
just watch the TV.

11:21.166 --> 11:23.667
Hey Jon, did I show you
my penguin having sex?

11:27.567 --> 11:29.400
And then the fish.

11:32.266 --> 11:35.100
Oh...

11:38.567 --> 11:40.867
Fuck you!

11:44.100 --> 11:47.033
Colin Mochrie.
One of my heroes.

11:47.066 --> 11:50.266
Playing a penguin
swallowing a fish.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.633
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

11:53.667 --> 11:55.433
That’s officially
Jon Lajoie done.

11:55.467 --> 11:56.967
Red carded and out.

11:57.000 --> 11:57.900
You’re fucking out.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.300
Bye, Jon.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.400
- It has been an honor.
- Oh, it’s been great.

12:01.433 --> 12:04.700
It legitimately makes
me feel emotional.

12:04.734 --> 12:06.367
So, thank you Colin.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.433
That... was fucking funny.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.333
- Ahhh.
- Alright, so?

12:12.367 --> 12:13.934
Ooh.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.367
How does it feel?
Are you happy to be done?

12:15.400 --> 12:17.667
Oh my god.
It’s exhausting it’s in there.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.300
Colin Mochrie.

12:19.333 --> 12:20.567
He was like doing
the equivalent of

12:20.600 --> 12:22.967
just beating
the shit out of me.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.033
We don’t know how you made it
as long as you did.

12:25.066 --> 12:29.066
There were so many fantastic
shots of you like this...

12:29.100 --> 12:31.700
We literally fucking
threw up in here.

12:31.734 --> 12:34.000
Colin knocks Jon
out of the game

12:34.033 --> 12:36.266
and I for one am relieved.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.367
It’s down to the final four
to scrap it out

12:38.400 --> 12:40.567
for a hundred thousand
dollars for their charity.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.934
Let’s rumble, babies!

12:42.967 --> 12:46.200
Sorry about all those
things that I was doing.

12:46.233 --> 12:50.934
I, Jay Baruchel,
believe R. Kelly is the man.

12:52.033 --> 12:53.000
Colin, may I?

12:53.033 --> 12:54.700
Oh yeah, I forgot he was there.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.033
Hours of fun.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.166
He only looks one way now.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.166
I don’t know what that means.

13:01.033 --> 13:03.133
Oh, that was close!

13:11.266 --> 13:13.166
Hello, all my gang.

13:14.367 --> 13:16.467
Oh.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.033
Where are my friends?

13:19.066 --> 13:22.734
Oh, I think Tom is doing
his mime thing to no one.

13:22.767 --> 13:24.300
I thought mimes
didn’t say anything?

13:24.333 --> 13:25.266
Then he’s a clown.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.133
Okay. Sorry.

13:26.166 --> 13:27.200
Hello, mister.

13:27.233 --> 13:28.734
Hello, Colin.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.400
Hello.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.300
Are you doing well?

13:30.333 --> 13:32.667
Yes, of course and you.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.000
Um, where did you study?

13:34.033 --> 13:37.200
Oh, uh, Quebec.

13:38.633 --> 13:41.433
Tom, in a beard
with a white face.

13:41.467 --> 13:45.633
It’s especially,
I’m gonna be frank, frightening.

13:45.667 --> 13:48.934
Eh, are you part of a troupe?
Or are you a solo artist?

13:48.967 --> 13:51.066
A little of this,
a little of that.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.100
Oh yeah.

13:52.133 --> 13:53.467
Oi, oi, oi.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.033
What’s the translation of that?

13:56.667 --> 13:57.667
Uh-huh.

14:01.734 --> 14:02.934
You know there are
French Canadians

14:02.967 --> 14:04.734
killing themselves
watching this right now.

14:04.767 --> 14:06.767
His fucking French
is pretty good.

14:07.967 --> 14:09.033
Um, and you...

14:09.066 --> 14:10.066
Hello, Andrew.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.667
Are you good sir?

14:14.600 --> 14:16.133
Look at my bag.

14:16.166 --> 14:17.333
- Alright.
- My bag.

14:17.367 --> 14:20.367
A little joke for you in
my bag, Andrew!

14:20.400 --> 14:21.467
Yes.

14:21.500 --> 14:22.633
Okay?

14:22.667 --> 14:23.533
Tom’s so funny.

14:23.567 --> 14:25.033
Look.

14:25.066 --> 14:26.100
Okay.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.433
- Oi, oi, oi.
- Oh! Oh!

14:28.467 --> 14:33.367
I was like oh!
Oh no, that’s good. That’s good.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.333
I am a...

14:36.367 --> 14:37.433
Squirrel!

14:37.467 --> 14:39.367
No, no, no. A squirrel.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.633
Squirrel, Colin?

14:40.667 --> 14:41.667
Grey.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.033
Hello, Colin.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.433
I am a grey squirrel.

14:46.467 --> 14:47.934
I am a...

14:47.967 --> 14:49.133
beige man.

14:53.033 --> 14:55.567
And I eat nuts for the winter.

14:55.600 --> 14:59.433
Because it’s very cold
in the winter, Andrew.

14:59.467 --> 15:00.734
It’s very cold!

15:00.767 --> 15:03.500
But the nuts feed me!

15:03.533 --> 15:05.000
Feed me for the winter, Andrew!

15:09.967 --> 15:11.533
Tom looked like a mime...

15:11.567 --> 15:14.000
But he kept shouting
which mimes don’t do.

15:14.033 --> 15:15.333
Feed me!

15:15.367 --> 15:17.967
Feed me for the winter!

15:18.000 --> 15:19.700
There’s no real idea there.

15:19.734 --> 15:23.166
It’s just Tom
going all the way on it.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.633
And it can be hard
to resist it.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.567
Uh, is your mime
usually this loud?

15:27.600 --> 15:29.633
I’m not a mime, I’m not a mime.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.467
Oh, I’m sorry.
Oh, you’re a clown?

15:32.500 --> 15:33.333
I’m not a mime...

15:35.600 --> 15:37.433
You are dressed like a mime.

15:37.467 --> 15:39.033
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

15:39.066 --> 15:40.367
I mean...

15:40.400 --> 15:43.000
If that doesn’t get you.

15:43.033 --> 15:45.400
So good. The commitment.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.033
Hello, fish.

15:47.066 --> 15:48.567
Hello, grey squirrel.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.433
Yeah. That’s Tom Green.
Here he is!

15:52.500 --> 15:55.033
Toot toot toot.

15:55.066 --> 15:56.133
Oh, so this is what’s happening?

15:56.166 --> 15:57.500
Hello, Brandon.

16:01.533 --> 16:03.600
I am a butterfly.

16:03.633 --> 16:05.266
What the hell is going on?

16:05.300 --> 16:07.333
I see Tom in...

16:07.367 --> 16:10.800
...like, white face.
Mmm, cancelling him!

16:10.834 --> 16:13.066
And I was trying very hard,

16:13.100 --> 16:15.266
I was like okay,
this is very funny.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.300
It was very funny.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.300
Do you speak a little French?

16:18.333 --> 16:19.400
What’s that mean?

16:19.433 --> 16:20.500
He’s asking if you speak French?

16:20.533 --> 16:21.367
No.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.467
Do you speak French?

16:22.500 --> 16:23.400
No, no Francais.

16:23.433 --> 16:24.300
You don’t speak French?

16:24.333 --> 16:25.166
<i>No Francais.</i>

16:25.200 --> 16:26.166
Okay.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.300
That’s it.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.767
Oi yoi yoi.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.100
I don’t think any of
them are gonna laugh.

16:31.133 --> 16:32.967
It’s okay. It’s okay.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.800
Just an attempt at a joke.

16:34.834 --> 16:35.667
Oi, oi, oi.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.166
I feel like we broke a clown.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.300
That didn’t work.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.400
What the fuck?
What’s Tom doing?

16:43.433 --> 16:45.400
I kinda figured
they dig the French comedy.

16:45.433 --> 16:46.867
What are you gonna do?

16:46.900 --> 16:48.967
I wonder how long it’ll take
to get rid of his makeup?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.400
Yeah.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.567
Got the gorilla suit.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.934
- Oh God, finally!
- Yeah.

16:59.967 --> 17:01.367
Tom’s not giving up.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.767
God bless Tom.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.333
Every shift,
he’s Gordie Howe, man.

17:05.367 --> 17:08.300
It actually does look
a little more Bigfooty.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.100
Yeah. It is a
Bigfoot actually, yeah.

17:10.133 --> 17:11.133
Oh.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.467
I am turning fifty.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.000
If you asked me when I was...

17:14.033 --> 17:15.166
sixteen years old,
what I would be doing

17:15.200 --> 17:16.467
on my fiftieth birthday,
I probably

17:16.500 --> 17:19.567
would have not guessed... this.

17:19.600 --> 17:23.667
Is this really what
I’m doing with my life?

17:23.700 --> 17:25.667
I was really hoping the French
stuff was gonna get ya,

17:25.700 --> 17:27.734
but what are ya gonna do?

17:28.800 --> 17:31.000
I don’t know.

17:31.033 --> 17:33.700
I tell ya Brandon, that really
knocks ’em dead in Val-d’Or.

17:33.734 --> 17:34.900
In Val-d’Or?

17:34.934 --> 17:37.400
Mmm.

17:37.433 --> 17:38.066
That’s great!

17:38.100 --> 17:39.867
Val-d’Or.

17:41.066 --> 17:43.266
So... time for shots or what?

17:43.300 --> 17:44.433
Oh, I’ll drink with you.

17:44.467 --> 17:46.133
You’ll have a drink
with me, Colin?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.066
Yeah, I’ll make you guys
a drink, what do you want?

17:47.100 --> 17:48.100
Oh, there we go.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.133
Oh, it’s gonna get dark.

17:49.166 --> 17:52.200
I’ll have, uh, a red wine.

17:52.233 --> 17:53.266
A red wine.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.633
Red wine, that sounds nice.

17:54.667 --> 17:57.934
What goes good with
red wine? Whisky?

17:57.967 --> 17:59.433
That was a joke.
That was, that was a gag.

18:05.533 --> 18:06.400
Hello?

18:06.433 --> 18:07.533
Hello. It’s Colin.

18:07.567 --> 18:08.934
Hi, Colin.

18:08.967 --> 18:11.200
I think I wanna do,
uh, Hamlet now.

18:11.233 --> 18:14.000
Oh, alright. I will get
that set up for you.

18:14.033 --> 18:15.200
Okay.

18:15.233 --> 18:16.667
See ya.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.967
I feel like when
my dad tunes into this show

18:21.000 --> 18:22.400
he’s gonna be proud of me.

18:30.300 --> 18:33.300
Ooh!

18:33.333 --> 18:36.233
Oh! I gotta do some,
some acting.

18:36.266 --> 18:38.333
One second, let me fix my hair.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.700
Okay. That’s much better.

18:39.734 --> 18:42.100
Tom looks like
he’s on a Rob Zombie movie.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.333
I’m gonna sit here.

18:47.367 --> 18:48.934
Oh, you doing Shakespeare,
you weren’t lying.

18:48.967 --> 18:51.600
I would like to do Hamlet.

18:51.633 --> 18:56.233
And one of my favourite
shows is, uh, baking shows.

18:56.266 --> 19:01.133
And then I realised,
Hamlet is Danish.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.100
- Mmm. I love danishes.
- Oh, damn.

19:03.133 --> 19:04.300
- He’s a Danish.
- Yeah.

19:04.333 --> 19:05.967
So in this version.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.967
Hamlet’s father of course
is killed by his uncle.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.166
Yeah.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.333
His father owned
the biggest pastry shops

19:11.367 --> 19:13.033
in the entire world.

19:13.066 --> 19:15.767
I’m like on the edge
of my seat with this.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.500
Colin’s doing
the Lord’s work in there.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.066
Hamlet has come up
with this plan

19:20.100 --> 19:23.100
to expose his uncle and
perhaps even kill him.

19:23.133 --> 19:24.200
Oh.

19:24.233 --> 19:25.233
Expose himself to his uncle?

19:25.266 --> 19:26.266
- Yeah.
- Ooooh.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.934
So one night he’s baking.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.600
He’s rolling up
his little balls.

19:29.633 --> 19:32.000
And he says one of
the most famous speeches

19:32.033 --> 19:35.266
ever in the history
of Shakespeare.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.700
- To be...
- Or not to be.

19:36.734 --> 19:38.667
That’s the one about
the moon landing, right?

19:38.700 --> 19:39.934
No. Not even close.

19:39.967 --> 19:41.166
Huh.

19:43.867 --> 19:48.400
Uh, but it is about
the frailty of humanity.

19:48.433 --> 19:50.166
Can see why it
never caught on.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.333
Yeah, no it’s like
a really popular show.

19:52.367 --> 19:55.000
Ah okay. Okay.
Seems a little too complicated.

19:57.033 --> 19:58.367
Human frailty.

19:59.967 --> 20:01.934
So Hamlet is so tired.

20:01.967 --> 20:07.200
Thinking about how he’s going to
avenge the death of his father.

20:07.233 --> 20:10.266
He starts to speak.

20:10.300 --> 20:13.567
To be or not...

20:13.600 --> 20:16.066
Owww fuck!

20:16.100 --> 20:16.934
Holy crap.

20:16.967 --> 20:17.600
Oh man.

20:21.900 --> 20:24.066
I love when
people hurt themselves.

20:27.233 --> 20:28.967
Owww, fuck!

20:29.000 --> 20:30.400
Colin Mochrie.

20:30.433 --> 20:32.033
He’s the Beyonce.

20:32.066 --> 20:33.133
Owww.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.033
And we are...

20:34.066 --> 20:36.066
...a sea of Michelles.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.867
I love Michelle Williams
by the way.

20:40.834 --> 20:43.533
Oh man. I’m so sorry.

20:43.567 --> 20:45.433
He gonna have to go to
the hospital after this.

20:45.467 --> 20:48.200
Shakespeare, man,
it will kill you!

20:50.266 --> 20:53.934
Colin is all world, man.
All world.

20:59.834 --> 21:03.333
I am definitely loosening
up, as you can see.

21:03.367 --> 21:04.934
Are you enjoying the wine?

21:04.967 --> 21:06.133
- Oh yeah, I am. Absolutely.
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.000
Yeah.
Probably was a mistake,

21:08.033 --> 21:09.500
strategically,
to start drinking.

21:09.533 --> 21:11.500
Absolutely. We may have
picked the wrong time.

21:11.533 --> 21:13.400
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.567
Hi.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.100
Uh, so I read your
minds and uh...

21:17.133 --> 21:17.967
Uh oh.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.500
Dance party.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.133
Okay.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.900
Wooo.

21:34.367 --> 21:36.066
I don’t know what to say.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.200
This is comedy gold, you guys.

21:40.033 --> 21:41.200
I’m worried.

21:44.567 --> 21:46.266
This is so awkward.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.400
It’s, like, torturously
uncomfortable now.

21:48.433 --> 21:51.100
Oh, I love being
in the mean kids room.

21:52.967 --> 21:54.800
We are now officially the comics
at the back of the club.

21:54.834 --> 21:55.934
We are, yeah.

21:58.667 --> 22:00.066
Shall we start rapping?

22:00.100 --> 22:01.133
Yeah, rap!

22:01.166 --> 22:02.367
Tom’s a very good rapper.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.600

- Seriously.
- He is!

23:32.867 --> 23:35.100
Not a tonne of
Scotch Canadian guys

23:35.133 --> 23:37.467
in their 60s
would be able to do that.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.934
Yeah.

23:38.967 --> 23:40.066
I didn’t think I was going

23:40.100 --> 23:41.133
to be at home with
the freestyle rapping.

23:41.166 --> 23:44.166
And yet, there I am.
Fully committed.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.567
You know what?

23:45.600 --> 23:47.467
This could actually be
the end of the career.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.033
That we’re filming.

23:49.066 --> 23:51.266
Well, you know.
Still no one laughing though.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.500
But everyone was grooving.

23:52.533 --> 23:53.533
- Yeah.
- Yeah, everyone was grooving.

23:53.567 --> 23:55.300
Like everyone was feeling it.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.600
I’m gonna lie down on my face
for about three minutes.

24:10.834 --> 24:11.800
Nah, that’s not gonna work.

24:14.066 --> 24:16.066
It’s time to check
out our Kill List.

24:16.100 --> 24:19.834
Andrew has come close
but hasn’t eliminated anyone.

24:19.867 --> 24:21.300
Same with Brandon... yet.

24:21.333 --> 24:24.100
Colin has been a
stone cold assassin

24:24.133 --> 24:26.533
bumping off Deb and Jon.

24:26.567 --> 24:28.600
Tom has been even deadlier,

24:28.633 --> 24:32.100
eliminating Mae,
K. Trev and Dave.

24:32.133 --> 24:34.200
Oh, and of course Caroline...

24:34.233 --> 24:36.166
Well, she kinda fucking
self destructed.

24:38.233 --> 24:40.700
We are all really
giving it our best shot.

24:40.734 --> 24:41.667
Okay.

24:41.700 --> 24:42.633
Uh huh.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.133
Pulling out all the stops.

24:44.166 --> 24:46.967
The good news is,
the last person to laugh

24:47.000 --> 24:48.967
can go down in history

24:49.000 --> 24:51.333
as being the most humourless
bastard in Canada.

24:51.367 --> 24:53.133
That is true.

24:53.166 --> 24:55.367
I wonder if you get a plaque
or something that says that?

24:55.400 --> 24:57.033
Just nice to be nominated.

24:57.066 --> 24:58.166
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.934
- Tom!
- Great Tom, doing it.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.700
What is, uh, an award
that you’re most proud of?

25:03.734 --> 25:07.934
In 2012, I was voted Best Local
Comedian and Best Local Actor.

25:07.967 --> 25:09.967
That’s, that’s the year
I quit my job to pursue comedy.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.133
That is, that’s amazing.

25:11.166 --> 25:12.100
- Oh, okay.
- What was your job?

25:12.133 --> 25:14.400
I ran, I ran a non-profit.

25:14.433 --> 25:16.967
My entire comedy career
has been a non-profit.

25:20.967 --> 25:22.500
- You got a house.
- Yeah. That’s true.

25:22.533 --> 25:23.800
- You got a dog.
- You have a legacy.

25:23.834 --> 25:26.567
I’ve got a dog.
I’ve got a Sasquatch costume.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.834
Everything’s going great.

25:28.867 --> 25:32.100
Is that a rental or yours?

25:32.133 --> 25:34.600
Eh, I don’t fucking know.

25:36.367 --> 25:39.066
I don’t how any of
them are gonna crack?

25:39.100 --> 25:41.667
Well, at this rate we’re gonna
fucking be here all night.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.834
It’s time to go to defcon one.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.533
- Ooh.
- Oh.

25:48.567 --> 25:51.066
Drastic times call
for drastic measures.

25:51.100 --> 25:52.433
Yeah. Good, good, good.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.800
- I don’t know.
- Uh oh.

25:54.834 --> 25:56.667
I wonder... I don’t know.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.333
Alright, um.

26:00.367 --> 26:02.300
It certainly didn’t
feel like anyone laughed.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.133
- No one did.
- Oh.

26:04.166 --> 26:05.934
Home stretch, we’re getting
close to the end here.

26:05.967 --> 26:07.400
You’ve all been great.

26:07.433 --> 26:10.834
Uh, but two of you have
failed to cause an elimination.

26:13.567 --> 26:17.767
At the one hour mark,
if neither of you

26:17.800 --> 26:20.066
makes someone laugh,
you’re out of the game

26:20.100 --> 26:22.066
and you’ll join me and
the others in the lodge.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.433
Ooh.

26:23.467 --> 26:25.333
The spirit is in me now.

26:25.367 --> 26:28.266
I have to like focus.
I’m ready for battle.

26:29.467 --> 26:31.734
This is the playoffs.
Win or go home.

26:31.767 --> 26:34.834
But the odds are stacked
against me because

26:34.867 --> 26:37.000
with those three
in the final four...

26:37.033 --> 26:38.700
I’m screwed.

26:38.734 --> 26:40.000
Good luck.

26:43.300 --> 26:45.967
Oooh.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.533
-
- From Schitt’s Creek!

26:47.567 --> 26:48.500
I wanna congratulate you...

26:48.533 --> 26:50.000
- Oh.
- Oh.

26:50.033 --> 26:51.600
...on being our final comedians!

26:51.633 --> 26:53.533
By this point...
I am so desperate.

26:53.567 --> 26:55.734
I’m just a little baby.

26:56.734 --> 26:58.166
I’m going bananas.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.533
If you told me that I’d be
doing this when I was 50...

27:00.567 --> 27:02.100
I probably would
have drowned myself.

27:02.133 --> 27:03.633
Oh!

27:03.667 --> 27:05.333
I am supposed to be here,
I’ve earned this spot.

27:05.367 --> 27:06.333
Woo.

27:06.367 --> 27:08.266
These heads gotta roll.

27:08.300 --> 27:09.433
Oh!

27:09.467 --> 27:10.300
A showdown!

27:10.333 --> 27:11.934
A comedy corral.

27:11.967 --> 27:14.133
- Grab his ass!
- Grab his ass!

27:14.166 --> 27:15.500
Off with his head.

27:15.533 --> 27:16.934
Finish him!

27:16.967 --> 27:19.000
You are the Last One Laughing.
