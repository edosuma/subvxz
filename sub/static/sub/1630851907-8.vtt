00:52.969 --> 00:57.057
Oh, hello.
Welcome to "A Very Big Mouth Christmas."

00:57.140 --> 00:58.850
We're gonna have a couple laughs,

00:58.933 --> 01:00.060
sing a few songs,

01:00.143 --> 01:04.314
and we're gonna make a promise to you
that no other Christmas special can.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.525
Tonight, you're gonna see Santa's dick.

01:07.609 --> 01:11.237
Hey, Maury, don't forget
to tell them we're sexy puppets.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.155
That's right.

01:12.238 --> 01:15.366
Nothing says Christmas
quite like a fist up your ass.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.411
Especially one that goes
all the way up to your brain.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.164
Jesus, Connie,
the guests aren't even here yet,

01:21.247 --> 01:23.958
and you're already
on your third glass of wine.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.503
It's not wine, it's my jingle juice.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.881
That's two drops of bitters,
a shot of Campari,

01:29.964 --> 01:33.927
and a robust squirt
of my very own feminine juices.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.971
Well, just keep that stuff
away from the couches, okay?

01:37.055 --> 01:39.307
Oh, come on, party pooper!

01:39.390 --> 01:41.226
It's Christmas!

01:41.309 --> 01:44.437
Jesus Christ! Damn it, I gotta clean this
up with one puppet arm. Fuckin' A.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.273
I'm sorry. But look how cute my barf is.

01:47.357 --> 01:50.110
It's all pipe cleaners and buttons.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.569
But seriously, Maury,

01:51.653 --> 01:53.863
what do you think Santa's dick looks like?

01:53.947 --> 01:58.576
We're gonna find out, Connie, but first,
we gotta clean up this adorable mess.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.912
Why don't you guys watch this little movie

02:00.995 --> 02:05.291
while I top off my drink
with some fresh lady juice.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.626
Uh-oh!

02:06.709 --> 02:09.254
-It has begun!

02:16.511 --> 02:19.180
A Christmas tree?
I think you forgot we're Jewish.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.142
Well, we are,
but, you know, Caitlin isn't.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.477
Guilty as Unitarian.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.689
Ugh.
I don't want to celebrate Christmas,

02:27.772 --> 02:29.315
I don't want Caitlin living here,

02:29.399 --> 02:31.943
and I definitely
don't want some cheese baby!

02:32.026 --> 02:34.279
Well, I agree about Caitlin
and the cheddar child,

02:34.362 --> 02:36.406
but brie reasonable, Jessi.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.949
Christmas is the best.

02:38.032 --> 02:40.034
I was there for the very first one,
you know.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.411
What do you mean "there"?

02:41.494 --> 02:43.329
Well, a long time ago,

02:43.413 --> 02:47.417
I was a hormones monstress
to a very special girl.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.085
Her name was Mary.

02:49.836 --> 02:53.965
The year was zero,
and Mary was a horny Jewish tween,

02:54.048 --> 02:55.133
just like you.

02:55.216 --> 02:58.094
There. Now your hair looks like old times.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.763
Oh, heads up, an angel is about to visit.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.307
She has some news.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.766
-Oh, my God!

03:03.850 --> 03:05.351
Yes, exactly!

03:05.435 --> 03:07.145
Somebody likes you.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.354
Really? Who?

03:08.438 --> 03:10.523
God! That's what I was saying.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.443
He likes you so much
he wants you to have his baby.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.360
Insane, right?

03:14.444 --> 03:16.321
Wait. God's gonna have sex with her?

03:16.404 --> 03:17.238
He does that?

03:17.322 --> 03:18.823
I mean, I--I know Satan does.

03:18.907 --> 03:22.327
He's dicked me down
a number of times, and listen, I him.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.871
No, no. God isn't gonna have sex with her.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.665
He doesn't want to touch Mary.
He just wants that baby.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.418
Oh, okay, so it's like a Tom Cruise thing.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.921
Does she need to sign an NDA
or something like that?

03:33.004 --> 03:34.589
-Mazel Tov, Mary!

03:34.672 --> 03:38.176
Wait a minute. I'm gonna have a baby,
but I don't even have sex?

03:38.259 --> 03:40.511
Isn't that like all of the calories
but none of the fun?

03:40.595 --> 03:43.848
Oh, honey, women's pleasure
is a thing of the future.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.391
Like broccolini.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.436
So you want me to be the "husband,"

03:48.519 --> 03:51.356
but we don't actually
have to do anything except hang out?

03:51.439 --> 03:53.233
My parents will love this. I'm in!

03:53.316 --> 03:54.651
Okay. Cool, cool, cool.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.695
So none of the men
in this story want to touch me?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.906
Anyways,
fast forward nine months,

03:59.989 --> 04:03.576
and you, I mean, Mary,
were about to give birth.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.203
But you had no place to do it.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.621
Knockity knock-knock.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.707
My wife is going into labor.

04:09.791 --> 04:10.625
Can we come in?

04:10.708 --> 04:13.670
And get birth juice
all over my new dirt floor?

04:13.753 --> 04:15.255
Take a hike!

04:16.381 --> 04:18.967
Hello, I'm ancient. How can I love you?

04:19.050 --> 04:23.888
Hi, we need a place for
my 12-year-old wife here to give birth.

04:23.972 --> 04:27.976
Oh, well, this hotel-motel is filled
with diapers and rotten dates

04:28.059 --> 04:31.437
because that's my community
and how I live.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.815
But you can use the barn in the back.

04:33.898 --> 04:37.694
And so they went to the barn,
but they called it a manger

04:37.777 --> 04:40.405
'cause I guess that was trendy
at the time? I don't know.

04:40.488 --> 04:44.742
So is stoning people,
which is dodge ball except with rocks,

04:44.826 --> 04:48.162
and then you get to,
you know, kill a guy with your friends.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.747
-And so,

04:49.831 --> 04:51.040
Mary started having the baby.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.668
Thankfully,
one of the animals was a doctor.

04:53.751 --> 04:56.462
-His name was Dr. Hooves.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.798
What do you mean you ate the epidural?

04:58.881 --> 05:01.134
Hi! Knock-knock! Is now a bad time?

05:01.217 --> 05:03.428
Whoa, are you going
to the bathroom or something?

05:03.511 --> 05:05.638
Who the hell are you? Get outta here!

05:05.722 --> 05:08.391
Uh, we're the three kings
and we brought you presents.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.019
But if you're gonna be a bitch about it,
we can take off.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.062
No, no, no, no, no! What did you bring?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.648
Well, I brought myrrh.
I don't know what it is.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.608
But if you smear it on your wang,

05:17.692 --> 05:21.237
it'll go numb, and then you feel
like you're jacking off a stranger.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.115
So hot. You never know
when the guy's gonna pop.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.658
And--And I brought gold.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.869
You want me to, like,
put it on your stomach?

05:27.952 --> 05:30.413
-I just don't want the doctor to eat it.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.333
Gold? I thought we were doing a $20 limit.

05:33.416 --> 05:37.253
I just got her the new Tom Clancy scroll.
It's good. It's a fun beach scroll.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.883
Okay, now she's really
going to the bathroom.

05:41.966 --> 05:44.218
-What do you mean it's a cheese baby?

05:45.219 --> 05:46.929
I already said I don't want a cheese baby.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.932
Oh, I don't know.
I think Baby Cheesus is kinda cute.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.684
Goo-goo gouda.

05:52.268 --> 05:55.855
-Now this will pair well with me!

05:56.856 --> 05:59.859
-I guess Baby Cheesus is a tiny bit cute.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.236
Are you kidding? This holy baby rules.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.448
Anyone want to, like,
wage a war on behalf of it?

06:05.531 --> 06:11.120
Kind of feels like we should kill anyone
who doesn't love and worship this baby.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.039
-Holy war!

06:13.122 --> 06:15.708
And that was the first Christmas.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.419
You know, some of that
felt less than accurate to me,

06:18.503 --> 06:20.380
if I can give you some fearless feedback.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.341
Oh! So you're thinkin'
Mary just got laid and then lied about it.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.551
Yeah, I did not say that.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.762
Oh, look,
there's a present under the tree.

06:27.845 --> 06:31.974
"To Jessi, from Caitlin.
Don't worry, it's not cheese."

06:32.058 --> 06:34.685
-Should I open it?
-Is Satan's dick long and curly?

06:34.769 --> 06:36.604
-I don't know.
-Oh, it is.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.857
"Little sister"?

06:39.941 --> 06:42.026
Oh, my gosh, a sister.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.027
Wow!

06:43.111 --> 06:45.905
You're gonna be a real good big sister.

06:45.988 --> 06:48.574
And, oh, you'll get
your present from me tonight.

06:48.658 --> 06:52.161
It's a sex dream,
and Dr. Hooves plays a prominent role.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.705
Okay. Well, now I'm scared to go to sleep.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.875
Would it help if I told you
that you were also a goat?

06:57.959 --> 07:00.920
-Kinda.
-Well, unfortunately, that's not the case.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.063
Oh, no! Dolly's bow is ripped!

07:19.147 --> 07:21.858
And on Christmas Eve!
What do we do, Jingle?

07:21.941 --> 07:23.151
That is a pickle.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.611
But don't worry, Twinkle. Santa will know.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.280
Well, let's go ask him.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.949
Huh, no answer.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.160
Well, it is a toy emergency.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.744
I guess we should go in?

07:33.828 --> 07:35.037
Well, I guess we should!

07:35.121 --> 07:38.666
-Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho!
-Oh, I've been naughty!

07:38.749 --> 07:41.085
-Dump your big bag of coal in my guts!
-Oh!

07:41.169 --> 07:42.920
Oh, stop now, Mama.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.883
If you keep talking like that,
this jolly old man's gonna blow!

07:46.966 --> 07:48.676
-Jiminy Christmas!
-Oh, shit!

07:48.759 --> 07:50.386
-Oh, no! G-get out!
-Oh!

07:50.470 --> 07:51.512
-Oh!
-Get out now!

07:51.596 --> 07:54.265
This was not for you to see! No!

07:55.725 --> 07:57.101
What were they doing?

07:57.185 --> 07:58.019
I don't know!

07:58.102 --> 08:01.772
In all my 400 years,
I've never seen anything like that.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.816
But I can't stop thinking about it.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.568
Can't stop thinking about what?

08:05.651 --> 08:09.280
We saw Santa doing something
kinda funny with Mrs. Claus.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.281
Funny how?

08:10.364 --> 08:12.200
Like Seinfeld funny?

08:12.283 --> 08:13.242
Not like Seinfeld.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.494
Not exactly like that.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.162
Like Hannah Gadsby funny?

08:16.245 --> 08:17.747
No, it's hard to describe.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.125
Well, if you can't describe it,
why don't you show us?

08:21.209 --> 08:23.544
Yeah! Show us what you saw!

08:23.628 --> 08:24.504
We're curious!

08:24.587 --> 08:26.964
I'm a visual learner. Charts and diagrams.

08:27.048 --> 08:30.218
-Well, I guess we could give it a whirl.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.803
One was riding the other, almost.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.639
It was kind of like this, right?

08:34.722 --> 08:36.849
-Oh! Oh, dear.
-Oh! Oh-oh!

08:36.933 --> 08:40.853
No, it was faster,
and it was also much harder.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.355
-Oh, yes, right there!

08:42.438 --> 08:45.149
Well, what's interesting is
that feels fucking fantastic.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.484
I wanna try too!

08:46.567 --> 08:48.194
-This does feel good!

08:48.277 --> 08:50.071
Say something mean to me!

08:50.154 --> 08:51.781
I want to feel embarrassed!

08:51.864 --> 08:54.242
-Golly fuck!

08:54.325 --> 08:55.159
Spit on that!

08:55.243 --> 08:57.370
-I'm in love with you!

08:57.453 --> 08:58.996
Just ruin my ass!

08:59.080 --> 09:00.748
-Mm-hmm.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.333
Okay. Okay.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.710
-Whoo!
-Great gumdrops!

09:04.794 --> 09:06.754
Whoa, what's going on in here?

09:06.837 --> 09:08.214
Stop this at once!

09:08.297 --> 09:09.215
Fuck you, Santa!

09:09.298 --> 09:10.508
We quit!

09:10.591 --> 09:13.052
Hey, Santa, Santa?
Why don't you watch me cum?

09:13.135 --> 09:14.136
I'm gonna cum right now,

09:14.220 --> 09:16.264
and I want you to look directly
into my eyes.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.683
-Oh, oh, dear.
-How are you doing with all this?

09:18.766 --> 09:21.644
-Hanging in there, buddy?
-Well, Christmas is ruined.

09:21.727 --> 09:25.273
Yeah, they're adult elves, you probably
should've just told them about sex.

09:25.356 --> 09:28.025
I probably should have.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.695
Anyway, I'm gonna go cover
that gingerbread man over there

09:30.778 --> 09:34.282
with my frosting, which is,
of course, and I can't stress this enough,

09:34.365 --> 09:35.866
my cum.

09:35.950 --> 09:36.784
I see.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.996
Well, I suppose children
around the world are going to have

09:40.079 --> 09:42.790
a very different
kind of Christmas this year.

09:44.041 --> 09:48.546
Ew, a moist Post-It note that says,
"I owe you an iPhone"?

09:49.380 --> 09:50.715
Oh! What?

09:50.798 --> 09:54.302
Tony Macaroni,
Chef Boyardee, and all the saints!

09:54.385 --> 09:57.263
Santa got me exactly what I wanted.

09:57.346 --> 10:00.433
It's two little friends
making thick in the warm!

10:00.516 --> 10:03.728
Yeah, you like to watch,
you sick, dirty fuck!

10:03.811 --> 10:05.313
Look at the box again.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.272
Uh-huh.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.065
Okay.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.942
Okay.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.613
Well, we told you
you were gonna see Santa's dick.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.906
But we threw in
them sweaty balls

10:15.990 --> 10:17.908
as a special Christmas surprise.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.911
Connie, the guests
are gonna be here any minute.

10:20.995 --> 10:24.498
Will you just get off your sweet
felt ass and walk the penises, please?

10:24.582 --> 10:25.875
They're not my penises!

10:25.958 --> 10:27.209
Okay, here we go.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.045
You loved them when they were cute,

10:29.128 --> 10:30.796
-little pup penises.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.341
Wait, is that my vibrator or yours?

10:33.424 --> 10:35.176
-God damn it!
-Uh-oh, who bailed now?

10:35.259 --> 10:39.513
Simon Sex just wrote
that he was murdered at Epcot Center.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.599
That sounds like a lie, doesn't it?

10:41.682 --> 10:44.602
Well, I just hope he died
doing what he loved,

10:44.685 --> 10:46.479
-standing in line.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.190
Oh, thank God.
At least somebody fucking showed up.

10:50.107 --> 10:53.069
-Oh, my. Am I the first one here?

10:53.152 --> 10:55.613
Yeah, Merry Christmas to you too,
Shame Wizard.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.406
By the way, it's still early.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.908
Is it? Oh.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.702
I've just come
from Kermit the Frog's party,

11:01.786 --> 11:02.745
and it was packed.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.414
It was quite fun, actually,

11:05.498 --> 11:08.417
until he called his girlfriend
a pig in front of everyone.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.128
He's a mean drunk, is Kermit the Frog.

11:11.212 --> 11:15.591
Yeah, well, people'll be here
any minute now, buster.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.967
You'll see!

11:17.051 --> 11:20.012
-Oh, but Constance, I'm afraid I will not,

11:20.096 --> 11:22.473
for I… I must be heading out.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.517
What? You--you just got here.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.018
I'm sorry, but, uh…

11:26.102 --> 11:29.438
I've--I've just been
murdered at Epcot Center.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.233
Good luck with your terrible party!

11:32.316 --> 11:34.944
Oh, Connie, this whole thing's a bust!

11:35.027 --> 11:37.113
We've got bigger problems, baby.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.157
One of your penises
left a present under the tree.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.826
I'll give you one hint.

11:41.909 --> 11:42.910
It's dick doodie.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.252
Hey, Luda! What do you think
of my new Christmas tree?

11:51.335 --> 11:56.048
I stole it from this kid Charlie Brown
who has, like, two hairs on his head.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.591
I think he might be sick.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.885
Brrish! Brish! Chris!

11:59.969 --> 12:01.595
Christmas… Christmas.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.223
What does Christmas mean to me?

12:04.306 --> 12:05.933
Revenge.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.893
It was Christmas Eve,

12:07.977 --> 12:10.980
and Anthony and I were bringing
squeezy toys and chicken skin

12:11.063 --> 12:12.940
-to underprivileged puppies.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.151
Only back then, I wasn't Luda.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.944
-I was…

12:17.027 --> 12:17.862
Pretzel!

12:17.945 --> 12:18.946
You little scamp.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.282
We got to deliver
these presents and get home.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.451
-Aw, I love you too, boy!

12:23.534 --> 12:24.452
Oh!

12:24.577 --> 12:27.997
Uh, happy holidays…
Uh, uh, what can I do for you gentlemen?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.206
Looks like someone

12:29.290 --> 12:31.500
-brought us some gifts, boys.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.335
Oh, you shouldn't have.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.797
I'm sorry. These presents
are for underprivileged puppies.

12:36.881 --> 12:40.551
Well, it looks like we are
underprivileged puppies now.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.011
Woof, woof.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.054
-Yeah!
-No, please!

12:47.725 --> 12:50.269
They made two mistakes that night.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.354
Killing my best friend,

12:52.438 --> 12:55.399
-and letting me live.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.817
-What a surprise.

12:56.901 --> 13:00.571
This doggy toy is filled with cheese.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.031
Where did you get?

13:02.114 --> 13:05.826
From some stupid man
and his fat dog, eh, Pretzel.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.745
"Pretzel"?

13:07.828 --> 13:09.538
-What a silly name.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.624
Uh, wait, what is this? Dark now?

13:15.085 --> 13:16.337
Agh!

13:26.472 --> 13:29.141
-Ahh!

13:39.068 --> 13:40.861
-Ahh!

13:42.196 --> 13:43.823
-Ah!

13:46.158 --> 13:49.078
Oh, please. Don't kill me.
I'll get you anything you want.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.872
Money, drugs, table food. Anything!

13:51.956 --> 13:54.542
Rrrnd. Rend.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.459
Friend.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.420
I want my best friend back…

13:58.504 --> 14:00.506
…you son of a bitch!

14:07.179 --> 14:10.641
I want that dog put down!

14:23.946 --> 14:26.282
-Holy Manute Boli,

14:26.365 --> 14:29.118
now I'm in Jay's dog's movie?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.244
Hi!

14:33.163 --> 14:35.416
-Bye!

14:35.499 --> 14:36.584
Ooh!

14:44.341 --> 14:47.011
Merry Christmas, Nicky!
Open your presents!

14:47.094 --> 14:48.721
A motorized scooter!

14:48.804 --> 14:49.972
And a drone!

14:50.055 --> 14:54.685
-That's holding Mets tickets!
-And a big hug from your little daddy.

14:54.768 --> 14:58.939
Another picture-perfect Christmas
for the Birch family.

14:59.023 --> 14:59.857
Good for Nick.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.443
Andrew! Put down your phone,
you schmendrick!

15:02.526 --> 15:05.237
We're celebrating
an olive oil-based miracle.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.698
Oy gevalt. It's still Hanukkah?

15:07.781 --> 15:09.658
Now open your terrible present.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.494
Surprise! It's a notebook from Walgreens!

15:12.578 --> 15:15.706
And it's got
"Fox News Babies" on the cover?

15:15.789 --> 15:18.751
And tomorrow night,
you're getting diet M&Ms.

15:19.335 --> 15:23.756
There is no greater injustice
than being a Jewish boy on Christmas.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.549
You really are missing out.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.969
Christmas is
the perfect orgy of bright lights,

15:29.053 --> 15:31.096
dairy-based alcoholic beverages,

15:31.180 --> 15:34.224
and great deals
at your local Honda dealership.

15:34.308 --> 15:39.021
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have
my parents debase and bankrupt themselves

15:39.104 --> 15:40.898
to give me one perfect Noel.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.609
Andrew, hold still.
There's a pube on your cheek.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.527
My bush is untenable.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.445
No, no, no, no.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.698
If you find a pube on your cheek,
you get to make a wish!

15:49.782 --> 15:53.410
Well, then, I wish I was…
…Christian.

16:04.838 --> 16:08.425
Oh, come on!

16:10.636 --> 16:13.138
Oh, no! My eyes! I'm blind!

16:13.222 --> 16:16.934
I'm gonna have to listen to the Mets
on the radio like some fucking barber.

16:17.017 --> 16:17.851
What the…

16:18.560 --> 16:20.270
Am I Spider-Man?

16:20.354 --> 16:21.397
Hi-ya!

16:21.480 --> 16:22.648
Oh.

16:22.731 --> 16:23.565
Probably not.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.693
A Smeg fridge?

16:25.776 --> 16:29.113
What happened to the old one that
smelled like newspapers on the inside?

16:29.196 --> 16:30.572
-Andy!
-Oh.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.450
We've been waiting
all morning to spoil you!

16:33.534 --> 16:35.744
-What? Why?
-And we made your favorite!

16:35.828 --> 16:38.539
Store-bought cake and normal M&Ms.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.291
Bullshit. What's your angle, Glouberman?

16:41.375 --> 16:42.584
Who's Glouberman?

16:42.668 --> 16:44.378
-I'm Martin Kent.
-Huh?

16:44.461 --> 16:46.338
Andrew, you gotta come see this.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.633
Your wish upon a pube came true!

16:49.717 --> 16:51.427
I'm a Christian!

16:51.510 --> 16:53.637
Son, there's no gift in the world

16:53.721 --> 16:56.598
that could ever capture
the deep love that I feel for you.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.350
Are you fucking kidding me?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.269
But I hope this comes close.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.604
Holy Gary, mother of Todd.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.773
These dumb WASPs bought me a Range Rover!

17:04.857 --> 17:08.110
Oh, and it's positively filled with guns!

17:37.139 --> 17:38.307
La!

17:38.390 --> 17:41.310
I can't believe
my parents let me drink gin.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.438
And now, the perfect end to a perfect day.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.481
Oh, yeah.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.984
I'm gonna have
an appetizer, entree, and dessert

17:49.068 --> 17:51.403
from Andy's Dick Squeeze Cafe.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.197
-And Creamery!

17:53.280 --> 17:55.491
-Whoa, come on, dude!
-Jesus?

17:55.574 --> 17:59.119
Yeah! And I didn't gruesomely
die on a cross in direct sunlight

17:59.203 --> 18:00.579
so you could diddle yourself!

18:00.662 --> 18:04.083
So wait, do Christians not like it
when you rubby the pee-pee?

18:04.166 --> 18:06.460
-My dad says it's a huge sin…

18:06.543 --> 18:08.545
…and he is psycho about that stuff!

18:09.004 --> 18:12.257
-Floor! Oh, shit!

18:14.134 --> 18:15.803
Oh, no. Am I in Arizona?

18:15.886 --> 18:17.971
Andrew, I actually think you're in Hell.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.973
Oh, thank God. Well, listen.

18:20.057 --> 18:25.020
If I'm stuck here for all eternity,
I might as well finish what I started--

18:25.104 --> 18:27.856
What?
Use me to stroke your disgusting dick?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.483
Holy shit, no!

18:29.566 --> 18:32.236
Oh, Andrew, your hands are your dad!

18:32.319 --> 18:35.114
-And his hands are chainsaws?

18:35.197 --> 18:37.199
Rusty chainsaws!

18:37.282 --> 18:39.368
Hey! Let's cut off his pecker!

18:39.451 --> 18:40.994
Yeah! Slice it right off!

18:43.872 --> 18:44.915
Oh, thank God,

18:44.998 --> 18:46.041
I'm alive,

18:46.125 --> 18:48.544
and my hands
are delicate and beautiful again.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.504
You there, boy! Oh, tell me.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.214
Do I look Jewish to you?

18:52.297 --> 18:55.134
Yes, you have
traditionally Jewish features!

18:55.217 --> 18:56.802
Oh, Maury!

18:56.885 --> 18:59.555
It's the greatest
Hanukkah gift of them all!

18:59.638 --> 19:02.516
-You talking cash?
-No, I'm Jewish again.

19:02.599 --> 19:07.646
And I wouldn't buy a Range Rover
if I made $10 million a year.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.649
The Ford Fusion is a perfectly good car.

19:10.732 --> 19:13.986
And to all of you at home, happy Hanukkah!

19:14.069 --> 19:16.196
Hey, don't talk directly to the audience.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.991
Who do you think you are? The Fleabag?

19:22.202 --> 19:24.830
What news arrives
from your mother, m'lady?

19:24.913 --> 19:28.709
Is she still traveling hither and yon
in pursuit of the band Hoobastank?

19:28.792 --> 19:32.629
Reading… "Hey, girl,
not gonna be back for Christmas.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.506
Here's a Hoobastank tank

19:34.590 --> 19:36.592
and a pack of their proprietary gum,

19:36.675 --> 19:38.051
Hooba Booba.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.095
Your sister, Mom."

19:40.179 --> 19:41.805
I'm so sorry, My Queen.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.016
I thought she might be home
for Christmas this year.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.268
Yeah, well,
I thought "fruip" ended with a "P",

19:46.351 --> 19:48.270
so I guess none of us knows anything.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.355
Are you saying "fruit" with a "T"?

19:50.439 --> 19:53.108
Yeah, everybody gets
fruip-cake for the holidays,

19:53.192 --> 19:54.776
and nobody wants it,

19:54.860 --> 19:56.695
just like Lola.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.449
Come on, Alanabeth, we're late
for our mother-daughter spray tans!

20:00.532 --> 20:02.826
I promise I'll close my eyes this time.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.786
You do whatever you want, sweetie.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.955
It's Christmas. I love you!

20:07.039 --> 20:10.500
Gasp! A gush of inspiration!

20:11.084 --> 20:12.753
Spaghetti… Cool.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.214
A tinfoil belly button ring,

20:15.297 --> 20:16.506
lip gloss…

20:16.590 --> 20:19.426
…Fritos for nails,

20:19.509 --> 20:21.136
and the Hoobastank tank…

20:21.220 --> 20:24.556
Oh, my Snowmom!

20:27.309 --> 20:31.897
Oh, my God, my Snowmom
has absolutely sprung to life.

20:31.980 --> 20:36.193
Shall we embark on an escapade
in this winter wonderland?

20:40.572 --> 20:43.951
Yes, sledding! Oh, glee!

20:44.034 --> 20:46.787
-Freezing cold boobies.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.413
-Boner alert!

20:49.414 --> 20:52.501
-I love you so much, Mommy.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.087
-Oh! Hey! Ow!
-You didn't, like, invent moms,

20:55.170 --> 20:57.965
you caramelized,
little sweet-for-nothing bitch!

20:58.048 --> 20:59.299
-Oh!

21:00.175 --> 21:03.470
What do you think, Snowmom?
Should we bake some gingerbread hotties

21:03.553 --> 21:05.013
and decorate this tree?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.390
-Ah! Snowmom?

21:06.473 --> 21:09.476
-Oh, no!

21:11.603 --> 21:14.439
Rodney, my mom's parole officer?

21:14.523 --> 21:16.817
Yeah, you don't need
to call me that every time though.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.403
You're honestly, like,
a very tertiary character, Rodney.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.322
-What do you want?
-Well, I got a postcard from your mom.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.492
Please, you're not special.
I got one of those postcards too.

21:25.575 --> 21:28.078
Yeah, and, you know,
since she's not gonna be here,

21:28.161 --> 21:30.956
and I got this extra-large
chicken parm sub,

21:31.039 --> 21:34.293
I thought, I don't know,
maybe you could help me finish it?

21:34.376 --> 21:37.754
And what, pray tell, am I supposed
to wash it down with, Rodney?

21:37.838 --> 21:39.089
Oh, I don't know.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.383
How about a nice Barq's Diet Creme Soda?

21:41.466 --> 21:46.513
Oh, well, then I look forward
to the sweet and savory burps

21:46.596 --> 21:49.474
that this combination will behold.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.568
You know what?
Fuck everyone I've ever met.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.445
We'll do the party without any of them.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.488
-Right, Connie?
-I don't know, Maury.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.824
I think I had too much jingle juice.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.159
I might just go to bed.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.243
But you can't!

22:08.327 --> 22:11.788
I made a fire and I need you
to stick the tree up my ass.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.249
-Can't we do it in the morning?
-No!

22:14.333 --> 22:17.294
-In my family, we do it on Christmas Eve.

22:17.377 --> 22:21.340
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You hear that?
Sounds like the walls are coughing!

22:21.423 --> 22:22.966
Oh, no, I forgot!

22:23.050 --> 22:24.968
Rick was supposed to surprise everyone

22:25.052 --> 22:28.472
by coming down the chimney
dressed as a lingerie Santa!

22:28.555 --> 22:30.390
-Ahh!

22:31.767 --> 22:33.226
Ho-ho…

22:33.310 --> 22:34.853
Hospital.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.522
Oh, sweet Rick, are you okay?

22:37.606 --> 22:40.275
Oh, my skin, it's boiling!

22:40.359 --> 22:44.446
You still want me to lick a candy cane
like it's your pee-pee?

22:44.529 --> 22:46.281
I mean, if you can.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.616
Okay.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.036
-Oh, shit! Rick's dead!

22:51.119 --> 22:53.497
And I never had the chance to tell him

22:53.580 --> 22:55.999
that I never loved him.

23:02.672 --> 23:05.258
Christmas wolf! Ho-ho!

23:05.342 --> 23:06.968
Okay. Easy, tiger.

23:07.052 --> 23:10.013
I can't believe we have to wait
four more days until we get our presents.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.432
I hope when I walk up
to the tree that morning,

23:12.516 --> 23:13.892
there's a card that says,

23:13.975 --> 23:18.605
"A charitable donation has been made
in your name to Mulch for America."

23:18.688 --> 23:20.690
Oh! It's such important work.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.193
Very interesting,
your Christmas traditions,

23:23.276 --> 23:24.361
all about the gifts.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.905
This glorification of consumption…

23:26.988 --> 23:28.073
So very American.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.784
Uncle Sam's club,
big bottle root beer cola…

23:30.867 --> 23:33.537
In our country,
Christmas is quite different.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.247
It's a celebration of life!

23:35.330 --> 23:37.499
Come on,
your Christmas isn't that different!

23:37.582 --> 23:39.584
Yeah, what,
do you wear candles on your head?

23:39.668 --> 23:41.878
Call Santa "Papa Winter" or something?

23:41.962 --> 23:43.338
Ha-ha! No!

23:43.422 --> 23:45.132
Our Santa is called…

23:45.215 --> 23:46.675
Vader Johan.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.136
In our country,
on the eve of Christmas,

23:49.219 --> 23:51.888
we put baubles
on the branches of the trees,

23:51.972 --> 23:55.350
-drink jurgennektaar, the salted eel milk…

23:55.434 --> 23:58.353
…and place our painted eggs
on the windowsill.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.648
Then, when daylight is no more,
the bell is rung.

24:01.731 --> 24:04.276
-This means Vader Johan approaches.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.153
It has begun.

24:07.195 --> 24:10.782
The bell awakens Vader Johan
from the bottom of the river.

24:10.866 --> 24:15.203
This is where he lives,
in a castle made of children's bones.

24:18.039 --> 24:20.041
-A braid of 40 eels…

24:20.125 --> 24:22.544
…brings Vader Johan to the surface.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.296
Now you can smell him.

24:24.379 --> 24:27.466
His odor is that of cod
and black licorice.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.342
He has the body of a walrus,

24:29.426 --> 24:31.219
the sharp teeth of a dolphin,

24:31.303 --> 24:33.722
and the legs of countless crabs.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.600
He plays a flute made of… you guessed it…

24:36.683 --> 24:38.643
Children's bones.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.939
And in our country,
it does not matter

24:43.023 --> 24:44.816
if you are naughty or nice,

24:44.900 --> 24:47.402
for all the bones taste the same to…

24:47.486 --> 24:48.862
…Vader Johan.

24:48.945 --> 24:54.242
Your only hope is to trick Vader Johan
into believing you are already dead,

24:54.326 --> 24:56.661
and therefore not fresh and tasty.

24:56.745 --> 24:59.372
You do this by sleeping
in your child coffin…

24:59.456 --> 25:00.957
…okay?

25:01.041 --> 25:04.544
And this is when you pray
to the Mongoose King.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.505
-Oh, Mongoose King,

25:06.588 --> 25:10.300
please protect my tender child bones
from the jaws of Vader Johan,

25:10.383 --> 25:12.552
and do enjoy
these eggs I have left for you.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.804
In Jesus' Christ's name, amen.

25:15.430 --> 25:19.226
Uh-oh,
Vader Johan can hear your blood!

25:19.309 --> 25:20.435
Perhaps you are lucky

25:20.519 --> 25:24.481
and your window eggs and prayers
have attracted the Mongoose King.

25:24.564 --> 25:28.318
He eats your eggs and challenges
Vader Johan to a battle of…

25:28.401 --> 25:31.488
-…dance.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.577
There is always the chance

25:37.661 --> 25:41.456
that the nimble and clever
Mongoose King will be victorious.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.167
But tonight, he is danced into…

25:44.251 --> 25:45.377
…cream.

25:46.670 --> 25:52.092
And Vader Johan has
his kinderbotfeest, the child bone dinner.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.886
But the cream,

25:54.970 --> 25:59.182
this is the cream that we eat together
with our families on 29 December.

25:59.266 --> 26:02.018
So a Merry Christmas is had by all.

26:02.102 --> 26:05.313
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait! So the kid died?

26:05.397 --> 26:07.691
He did not die, he was consumed.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.443
He lives on in the bowels of Vader Johan.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.028
I'm pretty sure he died, guys.

26:12.112 --> 26:17.284
Um, Vader Johan, uh,
he goes away after Christmas, right?

26:17.367 --> 26:21.621
Oh, no, Vader Johan
is always hungry for children.

26:21.705 --> 26:25.292
Like your precious food president,
Ronald McDonald.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.711
Oh, yes, this reminds me…

26:43.768 --> 26:44.728
-Help me!

26:44.811 --> 26:47.063
I don't wanna live
in Vader Johan's bowels!

26:47.147 --> 26:49.691
Will you share the story of Vader Johan?

26:49.774 --> 26:52.902
-Your child bones depend on it.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.831
Wake up, Matthew.

27:04.914 --> 27:07.083
Let's go downstairs and catch Santa

27:07.167 --> 27:09.336
while he's putting
all the presents underneath the tree.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.630
Oh, Brittany, go back to sleep.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.715
-There is no Santa.
-What?

27:13.798 --> 27:16.509
Yeah, Mom and Dad leave all the presents.

27:16.593 --> 27:17.761
Santa's not…

27:17.844 --> 27:19.179
…real.

27:19.262 --> 27:21.806
-Good Lord. I'm not real?

27:24.893 --> 27:27.395
No, no. It can't be.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.564
I-I'm as real as these flying reindeer.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.817
Although now that
I think about it, can reindeer fly?

27:32.901 --> 27:33.985
Oh! Oh!

27:37.405 --> 27:39.449
Have I been delusional all this time?

27:39.532 --> 27:44.412
How can one man possibly deliver presents
all over the world in a single night?

27:44.496 --> 27:47.123
I'm supposed to be thousands of years old.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.084
I look 65, tops!

27:49.167 --> 27:53.004
If I really drank
a million glasses of milk in one night,

27:53.088 --> 27:56.800
I'd make a terrible mess
in my Santa pants.

27:56.883 --> 28:00.637
Excuse me, Santa, how come
I never get a present for Christmas?

28:00.720 --> 28:03.139
Is it because of that time
I did arson on a 7-Eleven?

28:03.223 --> 28:04.432
Don't ask me, kid.

28:04.516 --> 28:08.687
I'm just some big,
fat nutjob in a silly red suit.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.355
Yeah, my dad says you're not real,

28:10.438 --> 28:12.565
but he says a lot of things
just to make me cry.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.068
Yeah, well, at least you exist.

28:17.779 --> 28:20.407
Can we turn that goddamn music off?

28:20.490 --> 28:22.325
-Jesus Christ.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.495
What in the Grinch's
emerald green asshole was that?

28:25.578 --> 28:27.622
We got you now, Pretzel.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.290
-You'll have to let me know

28:29.374 --> 28:32.836
-if all dogs do, in fact, go to heaven.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.672
That movie, to me, is good animation.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.007
Nothing nasty, just nice story.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.467
Leave him alone!

28:39.551 --> 28:41.219
Who the fuck is this guy?

28:41.302 --> 28:43.680
I'm motherfucking Santa Claus!

28:43.763 --> 28:45.473
Oh, yeah?

28:45.557 --> 28:48.727
Well, then, I guess I am Easter Bunny?

28:48.810 --> 28:50.687
-I know the Easter Bunny,

28:50.770 --> 28:52.856
I work with the Easter Bunny,

28:52.939 --> 28:56.359
and you, sir, are no Easter Bunny!

28:56.443 --> 28:57.736
Yeah!

29:01.364 --> 29:03.825
-Hi-yah!

29:08.580 --> 29:09.956
Ya koshka.

29:10.039 --> 29:13.710
-This is Russian for "I am cat person."

29:13.793 --> 29:15.336
No!

29:17.046 --> 29:19.257
-Agh!

29:19.340 --> 29:22.343
Maybe I… am real.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.054
-They'll never stop coming for you.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.223
-Isn't that right, boy?

29:29.225 --> 29:32.270
Just maybe you can find some peace here.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.527
Holy shit! I knew Santa was real.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.571
He got me a pit bull! Oh, my God!

29:41.654 --> 29:45.450
I'm gonna name you "Featuring Ludacris."

29:45.533 --> 29:46.534
No parentheses.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.286
Brrrll. Brrill. Kill.

29:48.369 --> 29:52.415
Kill. Kill. Kill one man,
and you are a murderer.

29:52.499 --> 29:56.711
Kill them all, and you are a god.

29:58.296 --> 30:02.050
Merry Christmas to all, and to all…

30:02.133 --> 30:04.093
…a good night.

30:11.976 --> 30:17.148
And all I really wanted was an absolutely
picture-perfect Christmas party

30:17.232 --> 30:20.193
that would be remembered
even after the world ended.

30:20.276 --> 30:22.779
But instead,
I booted tummy juice on the couch,

30:22.862 --> 30:25.365
nobody showed up, and Rick's dead.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.617
Is me recapping this helpful to you?

30:27.700 --> 30:28.827
No, it's not.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.578
Ooh! The sword!

30:30.662 --> 30:34.123
Yep, as is customary
in hormone monster culture,

30:34.207 --> 30:37.752
we must now decapitate
dear, dead Rick and fuck his skull…

30:37.836 --> 30:41.005
That he may rest
his weary, cum-filled head.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.675
In Jesus Christ's name, amen.

30:43.758 --> 30:46.386
Yeah, cut off my fuckin' head
nice and slow.

30:46.469 --> 30:48.263
-Rick!
-You're alive!

30:48.346 --> 30:51.015
Nothing can kill me!
That's my curse, baby!

30:51.099 --> 30:54.143
Oh, Rick, just seeing you again
makes me feel like

30:54.227 --> 30:57.230
I could dance
the Mongoose King into cream.

30:57.313 --> 31:00.859
-Well, that's what Christmas is all about.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.405
Because Christmastime is
when all good boys and girls

31:05.488 --> 31:07.907
do a lap dance for the king of the mall.

31:07.991 --> 31:08.825
What's that now?

31:08.908 --> 31:11.953
You gotta mix and mingle
in the jingling feet.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.497
And that is the "Crocodile Rock"!

31:14.581 --> 31:17.166
Maury, this is pitiful.
Jump in on this, please?

31:17.250 --> 31:19.544
I think what Rick is saying is

31:19.627 --> 31:24.382
the only thing that matters at Christmas
is being with the ones you love.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.342
And I love you guys!

31:26.426 --> 31:27.969
Ah, I love you too.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.430
Even if you did ruin my party.

31:30.513 --> 31:31.347
Merry Christmas!

31:32.932 --> 31:34.225
Uh-oh! Shit, Maury…

31:34.309 --> 31:37.020
…do you smell
cod and black licorice?

31:37.103 --> 31:39.647
-Yes, and I hear a braid of eels.

31:39.731 --> 31:43.192
-Uh, did you put out the eggs?
-I was too busy getting blackout drunk!

31:43.276 --> 31:47.238
Good thing I know how to dance
like a mother baby, fucker.

31:50.825 --> 31:54.203
Vader.

31:54.287 --> 31:56.289
Johan.

31:57.832 --> 32:01.127
Vader Johan.

32:01.210 --> 32:04.464
That's what Christmas is all…
…about.

32:04.547 --> 32:07.884
That's what Christmas is all…
…about.

32:07.967 --> 32:09.677
…bones.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.387
The bones of… children.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.765
Children's… …bones.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.769
And now
you can smell him.

32:17.852 --> 32:21.481
We're going to dance
the Mongoose King into… …cream.

32:21.564 --> 32:25.109
That's what Christmas is all…
…about.

32:25.193 --> 32:28.780
Vader.

32:28.863 --> 32:31.783
Johan.

32:31.866 --> 32:35.787
Vader.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.790
-Johan.
