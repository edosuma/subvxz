00:52.585 --> 00:54.788
It's weird to live as
an average-looking guy.

00:54.901 --> 00:55.901
It's different--

00:56.021 --> 00:58.791
Guys that are, like,
good-looking don't have any idea

00:58.904 --> 01:00.185
what it's like to live

01:00.305 --> 01:02.493
and just know that there's
a whole massive section

01:02.606 --> 01:04.091
of the female population

01:04.211 --> 01:06.091
that you just
don't have access to.

01:06.211 --> 01:07.964
You're just...

01:08.077 --> 01:09.670
I-- I get so sick.

01:09.790 --> 01:12.380
When I ( bleep ),
I just gross myself out.

01:15.638 --> 01:18.043
I'm always on my back, and
that's for her benefit.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.901
I just don't want
to make a woman see this.

01:22.771 --> 01:24.594
It's just not fair.

01:24.707 --> 01:26.298
She's so nice to let me
( bleep ) her,

01:26.411 --> 01:29.014
there's just no way I'm
gonna put her through that.

01:37.759 --> 01:39.048
I gotta--

01:39.161 --> 01:40.623
And I always gotta have
my shirt on, too,

01:40.743 --> 01:45.089
because last time
I did it without a shirt on

01:45.202 --> 01:46.458
and I was like--

01:46.571 --> 01:49.139
I'm like this, and it hangs.

01:51.321 --> 01:53.615
It's a mother dog.

01:53.735 --> 01:58.664
It's a mother dog's,
like, 14-nipple belly.

01:58.784 --> 02:02.844
That's what happens if
I go like this.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.725
It's happening now,
you just can't see it.

02:06.838 --> 02:10.654
It's a six-pack for a whole
other reason.

02:10.767 --> 02:13.390
It just hangs in sections.

02:13.503 --> 02:14.691
It actually--

02:14.804 --> 02:17.996
in three sections
with a split in the middle.

02:18.109 --> 02:20.264
And it jiggles when I'm
( bleep ), too,

02:20.377 --> 02:22.345
it's not like it's just there.

02:23.836 --> 02:26.037
Last time I had that happen,
I looked down,

02:26.150 --> 02:27.253
I was like, "Oh, no,"

02:27.373 --> 02:28.974
and I looked at her
and she was looking down.

02:29.094 --> 02:30.312
"Ew!"

02:32.055 --> 02:33.488
I never saw her again.

02:55.447 --> 02:56.936
Hello?

02:57.049 --> 02:58.838
Hey-- hey, Janice.

02:58.951 --> 03:01.074
It's-- it's--it's Louie.

03:01.187 --> 03:04.379
Louie?
<i>Yeah, we--</i>

03:04.492 --> 03:05.947
Hi.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.649
What's up?

03:09.331 --> 03:11.280
Hi. Hey. How... How're you doing?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.755
I'm fine, fine.

03:12.868 --> 03:14.423
What's up?

03:14.536 --> 03:17.140
Uh, I just was...

03:18.969 --> 03:20.730
I'm just was--
I know that we--

03:20.843 --> 03:23.634
I know that we met in
a professional capacity

03:23.747 --> 03:26.303
<i>and I don't--</i>

03:26.416 --> 03:28.072
<i>i just wondered if maybe</i>
<i>you want to--</i>

03:28.185 --> 03:31.042
if we-- if you-- maybe
go to dinner sometime?

03:31.155 --> 03:32.878
Just, you know, no--

03:32.991 --> 03:34.312
<i>just go out.</i>

03:34.425 --> 03:35.435
Sure.

03:35.555 --> 03:38.316
Wow, really?
Yeah.

03:38.429 --> 03:40.619
When do you want to go?

03:40.732 --> 03:42.287
Uh, tomorrow ?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.957
To-- to a movie or something?

03:45.070 --> 03:46.392
Yeah.

03:46.505 --> 03:48.627
Okay, I'll text--

03:48.740 --> 03:53.035
I'll text you with the
particular-- exactly the place

03:53.155 --> 03:56.001
<i>and you'll have more data.</i>

03:56.114 --> 03:57.269
Great.

03:57.382 --> 03:58.815
I'll see you then.

04:06.524 --> 04:08.205
Who was that?

04:08.455 --> 04:10.850
Louie CK just asked me out,
I guess.

04:10.963 --> 04:12.485
Ha.

04:12.598 --> 04:14.287
You said yes?
Yeah.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.855
Not on a date,

04:15.968 --> 04:18.870
but he could be someone
at some point, couldn't hurt.

05:08.554 --> 05:10.511
Oh, my God, get some help!

05:10.631 --> 05:12.857
Help what? His head came off.

05:45.256 --> 05:46.590
Hi.

05:49.327 --> 05:51.350
So what movie are we seeing?

05:51.463 --> 05:53.352
What?

05:53.465 --> 05:56.121
What movie did you want to see?

05:56.234 --> 05:58.457
I don't care.

05:58.570 --> 06:00.158
Oh.

06:00.271 --> 06:01.905
Okay.

06:04.708 --> 06:06.330
You wanted to see a movie?

06:06.443 --> 06:08.532
I don't think I can sit a theater

06:08.645 --> 06:11.279
and watch actors
pretend and talk, I...

06:13.049 --> 06:16.205
Are you okay?
I'm gonna go for a walk.

06:16.318 --> 06:18.675
You can come if you wanna.

06:18.788 --> 06:20.588
I'll come with you.

06:34.288 --> 06:35.802
Did you ever think how--

06:36.067 --> 06:38.141
About how your life could end
any second?

06:38.802 --> 06:40.364
Sure.

06:41.613 --> 06:43.668
No, you don't.

06:43.781 --> 06:45.503
I mean, you think
you're gonna live forever

06:45.616 --> 06:46.949
and you probably will.

06:47.069 --> 06:48.568
I don't think that.

06:48.688 --> 06:51.842
It's just so arrogant
the way we live our lives.

06:51.955 --> 06:56.212
You know, we're constantly right
on the edge of existence

06:56.325 --> 06:59.834
and nothing and we live
in total disrespect of that.

07:01.026 --> 07:03.052
And there's people in other
parts of the world,

07:03.165 --> 07:07.123
like Africa or Afghanistan, who--

07:07.236 --> 07:10.560
Those people, they know,
because they live on that edge

07:10.673 --> 07:12.820
and they lose people
every day.

07:12.940 --> 07:17.193
They die in a war
or in a disease thing.

07:17.313 --> 07:18.680
And they...

07:20.383 --> 07:22.192
And we think we're the ones.

07:22.312 --> 07:24.059
We think this is
the important place.

07:24.179 --> 07:26.971
Like we live in the center
of the goddamn universe.

07:27.084 --> 07:28.085
I know.

07:28.201 --> 07:31.280
And it's just--
it's bullshit.

07:31.393 --> 07:34.149
It's meaningless.

07:34.262 --> 07:36.618
I mean, I started
this day obsessed

07:36.731 --> 07:39.770
with how this would go,
this non-date with you.

07:39.890 --> 07:42.079
You don't want to date me,
I know that.

07:42.199 --> 07:43.000
But I was--

07:43.120 --> 07:47.530
"Ooh, please, God, could this
woman want to go out with me?"

07:47.643 --> 07:49.966
And maybe if I could
upgrade us to a date

07:50.079 --> 07:54.568
with bullshit conversation and
by seeing some crappy movie.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.177
And it doesn't mean anything.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.646
I mean, you could get
hit by a truck

08:00.759 --> 08:03.355
or shot in the chest by a gun guy.

08:03.475 --> 08:07.561
I could get thrown off a--
out of a helicopter.

08:10.270 --> 08:12.446
You know, Janice,
you're gorgeous,

08:12.566 --> 08:15.233
and I find you very attractive
and you're very nice.

08:15.836 --> 08:18.219
You're not even nice, honestly.

08:18.339 --> 08:21.635
And-- and... I just--

08:21.748 --> 08:24.938
I'm just sick of living
this bullshit life.

08:25.051 --> 08:26.485
Me too.

08:28.555 --> 08:29.655
Me too.

08:45.311 --> 08:47.752
Louie, I didn't know
what you were really like.

08:49.210 --> 08:51.299
What do you mean?

08:51.412 --> 08:54.368
Well, since you're being
so awesomely honest,

08:54.481 --> 08:55.946
no, you're right.

08:56.066 --> 08:58.272
I didn't want to go
on any date with you.

08:58.392 --> 09:00.506
I agreed because
you're on camera

09:00.619 --> 09:02.620
and you might be something.

09:02.914 --> 09:04.779
I'll say it.

09:04.892 --> 09:07.415
I'm superficial.

09:07.528 --> 09:09.584
But wow.

09:09.697 --> 09:10.952
You're really--

09:11.065 --> 09:14.255
I mean, what happened?

09:14.368 --> 09:16.673
Because the last time we met,
you were sort of...

09:16.793 --> 09:18.703
A goof.

09:18.823 --> 09:21.849
Yeah, well, I was attracted to
you, so I was all nervous

09:21.969 --> 09:23.984
and acting stupid.

09:24.104 --> 09:26.205
Well, why aren't you
like that now?

09:27.381 --> 09:29.755
Well, something happened.

09:30.049 --> 09:32.578
Like, when I was
on my way to see you.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.322
What happened?

09:36.390 --> 09:38.547
I was walking here,
to the theater,

09:38.660 --> 09:42.251
and I was at a red light,
like, standing on this corner,

09:42.364 --> 09:45.821
and this bum, like a homeless
guy, just came running,

09:45.934 --> 09:47.923
he was screaming
and I turn and I see

09:48.036 --> 09:50.126
and he's running right at me.

09:50.420 --> 09:52.260
He's looking at me
and he's running,

09:52.373 --> 09:54.762
like 30 miles an hour, just...

09:54.875 --> 09:56.680
crazy.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.121
And he gets right on
top of me, like,

09:59.241 --> 10:03.887
and he goes to grab me
and I ducked out of the way

10:04.007 --> 10:06.331
and he went sprawling into
the intersection,

10:06.451 --> 10:11.147
and a garbage truck
came and hit him...

10:11.260 --> 10:13.431
And his head came off.

10:13.551 --> 10:14.668
What?

10:14.788 --> 10:17.094
His head came off and it went,
"dun, dun, dun"

10:17.207 --> 10:18.207
down the street.

10:18.327 --> 10:21.992
It was--
it was horrible.

10:22.105 --> 10:24.060
His head came off?

10:24.173 --> 10:25.519
Yeah.

10:25.639 --> 10:27.622
Oh, my God.

10:27.945 --> 10:30.500
Oh, my God,
and you saw that?

10:30.613 --> 10:32.201
Yeah.

10:32.314 --> 10:34.203
Oh, my God.

10:34.316 --> 10:35.645
That's awful.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.807
That's so awful.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.849
That's the worst thing
I ever heard of.

10:39.969 --> 10:43.046
You saw that and then
you came out with me?

10:43.159 --> 10:44.982
Yeah, that's-- that's why--

10:45.095 --> 10:46.295
Oh, God!

10:48.178 --> 10:50.604
I think I need to go home.

10:51.037 --> 10:52.038
Oh, my God.

10:52.158 --> 10:54.802
Well, but--
do you want to...

10:56.081 --> 10:58.197
I didn't mean to upset you.

10:58.310 --> 11:00.065
I just...

11:00.178 --> 11:01.260
I mean, we could get a--

11:01.380 --> 11:03.869
I thought it was
kinda going well.

11:03.982 --> 11:06.460
I thought maybe you--
I didn't know that you--

11:09.030 --> 11:12.120
Another time I was
on a subway and...

11:12.233 --> 11:14.590
This woman got on the train,
young woman, and she--

11:14.703 --> 11:16.459
You know you can tell how long
people have been in New York

11:16.572 --> 11:17.419
by how they get on the subway?

11:17.539 --> 11:20.463
Because people that live here
just get on, like, "Ugh."

11:20.576 --> 11:23.112
But she got on like this,
like...

11:28.519 --> 11:30.408
It was pretty bad last time.

11:30.521 --> 11:32.444
I hope...

11:32.557 --> 11:35.525
I hope nobody
pisses in my face today.

11:39.262 --> 11:42.886
Last time, 14 people pissed
right into my mouth.

11:42.999 --> 11:46.823
That was really traumatic for
me, but I'm hanging in there.

11:46.936 --> 11:48.503
Still taking the train.

11:51.594 --> 11:53.395
That's mine.
This one here?

11:53.508 --> 11:54.142
I did it.

11:54.262 --> 11:56.799
That's so good,
it's so good.

11:56.912 --> 11:59.823
Nice job.

11:59.943 --> 12:00.973
This one's yours.

12:01.093 --> 12:03.807
I know, it says your name on it.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.376
All right, honey,
I'll see you later.

12:05.489 --> 12:06.923
Have a great day, okay?

12:08.422 --> 12:09.422
Bye-bye.

12:09.542 --> 12:11.255
See ya.
Bye-bye.

12:11.375 --> 12:12.913
Can I talk to you
a second about Jane?

12:13.033 --> 12:15.881
Yeah, sure.
Her math is not very strong.

12:16.001 --> 12:17.572
She has to get strong in math.

12:17.692 --> 12:19.773
She loves math,
she's just been struggling.

12:19.893 --> 12:21.949
Well, she needs
to step it up.

12:22.449 --> 12:24.707
Okay.
Okay, thank you.

12:26.586 --> 12:28.737
Hey, you're Jane's father?
Yeah.

12:28.857 --> 12:30.718
We never met,
I'm Nelson's mom.

12:30.831 --> 12:33.253
Nelson's the--
Yes, he stutters.

12:33.366 --> 12:35.460
No, I was gonna say,
he has black hair.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.990
Nelson has blonde hair.

12:37.103 --> 12:38.892
I don't know Nelson, then.

12:39.005 --> 12:41.462
I have him with his father,
Gabriel, who left him.

12:41.575 --> 12:43.231
That's--

12:43.344 --> 12:45.733
What is your feeling
about that plasma screen?

12:45.846 --> 12:47.435
How do you--
how do you mean that?

12:47.548 --> 12:49.704
The PTA wants to put a plasma
screen at the school entrance

12:49.817 --> 12:51.306
to replace
the announcement board.

12:51.419 --> 12:53.775
I think it's a huge waste of
money and it's anti-aesthetical,

12:53.888 --> 12:55.343
plus, I think it's just gonna
become, like,

12:55.456 --> 12:57.279
a propaganda machine.

12:57.392 --> 12:59.481
I don't really have an opinion.

12:59.594 --> 13:01.217
Hmm.

13:01.330 --> 13:03.085
That's a cop-out.

13:03.198 --> 13:04.654
Yeah, I guess it is.

13:04.767 --> 13:06.823
I just-- you know,
I think that board is fine,

13:06.936 --> 13:09.393
I think a plasma screen
would be okay.

13:09.506 --> 13:11.261
I doubt it would be
propaganda, but I don't know,

13:11.374 --> 13:12.429
so I don't really--

13:12.542 --> 13:14.064
I kinda just don't care,
so I guess--

13:14.177 --> 13:15.532
I don't know what your deal is,

13:15.645 --> 13:17.980
but do you wanna
go out sometime?

13:18.753 --> 13:20.738
You know what,
dating somebody from school--

13:20.851 --> 13:21.852
I'll be real honest with you.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.031
I don't date at all.

13:23.151 --> 13:25.031
I'm not gonna let someone
into my life in that way.

13:25.151 --> 13:27.782
I have things under control
and I just don't need it.

13:27.895 --> 13:29.717
Yeah, it's totally--

13:29.830 --> 13:32.420
But I haven't had sex
in a very long time.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.356
I'm approaching you
about this

13:34.469 --> 13:36.478
because you seem
safe and discreet,

13:36.598 --> 13:37.243
that's what I am,

13:37.363 --> 13:39.467
so if you want to come over
some night and fool around,

13:39.587 --> 13:41.687
I'm just saying, it would be
uncomplicated.

13:41.807 --> 13:43.291
At least from my end.

13:44.781 --> 13:47.223
Well--my name is Delores,
I'm on the class list.

13:47.343 --> 13:49.282
E-mail me if you
want to do anything.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.164
Okay.

14:05.660 --> 14:06.660
Hey.

14:06.908 --> 14:08.171
Hey, I'm here for the thing--

14:08.291 --> 14:10.064
Can you take off your shoes, please?
Sure.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.325
Just--

14:14.670 --> 14:16.425
Sorry.

14:16.538 --> 14:18.438
I hate boots, it's--

14:33.056 --> 14:34.394
Is Nelson--

14:34.514 --> 14:35.936
No, Nelson is with his dad.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.316
Oh, okay.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.884
Do you want to have
intercourse now?

14:49.997 --> 14:51.352
Are you ready?

14:51.465 --> 14:53.366
Because I don't mind going
to bed, if that's what you want.

14:55.569 --> 14:57.192
Uh... sure.

14:57.305 --> 14:59.093
Yeah, okay, come on.
Okay.

14:59.206 --> 15:00.907
Intercourse.

15:05.813 --> 15:07.669
I'll be right back.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.383
Oh, okay, sorry.

15:37.849 --> 15:40.372
You know, the PTA is so full of it,

15:40.485 --> 15:42.307
'cause they generate
all these e-mails

15:42.420 --> 15:46.378
about fund-raising and how
everybody needs to pitch in

15:46.491 --> 15:48.793
and then they don't want
anyone to have any say

15:49.043 --> 15:50.961
into how the money is spent.

15:51.414 --> 15:53.120
How does that make any sense?

15:54.900 --> 15:56.622
Yeah.

15:56.735 --> 15:57.935
That's...

16:09.225 --> 16:10.379
Oh, shit.

16:10.492 --> 16:11.647
What?

16:11.760 --> 16:13.616
Can you run downstairs
and pick up a few things?

16:13.729 --> 16:15.257
Downstairs?

16:15.377 --> 16:16.118
There's a pharmacy.

16:16.231 --> 16:17.653
Can you get some lubricant?

16:17.766 --> 16:19.154
And also, did you bring condoms?

16:19.267 --> 16:20.789
Yeah.
What kind?

16:20.902 --> 16:23.257
I got these.

16:23.370 --> 16:25.581
Ugh, that has an irritant.

16:27.407 --> 16:31.189
Just get some condoms with
no spermicide, no lubricant,

16:31.309 --> 16:33.061
and get some lubricant separately.

16:33.181 --> 16:34.182
Lubricant?

16:34.295 --> 16:36.594
Yes, sexual lubricant,
condoms,

16:36.714 --> 16:38.253
and can you also
get some Vagitine?

16:38.768 --> 16:41.157
Vagitine?
Yes, my vagina's irritated.

16:42.007 --> 16:43.007
Oh, well, maybe this--

16:43.127 --> 16:44.916
No, no, it's fine,
I just need some Vagitine.

16:45.029 --> 16:46.436
No, it's all right,
I got it, I got it.

16:46.556 --> 16:49.781
No, you are not
buying my Vagitine.

16:49.901 --> 16:51.928
I'm not going down that road,
I told you.

16:52.048 --> 16:54.136
I just want you
to pick it up.

16:55.172 --> 16:56.596
Listen, Delores.

16:56.716 --> 16:57.716
What?

17:00.743 --> 17:03.032
Nothing, I'll be
right back, okay?

17:03.145 --> 17:04.943
Okay, thanks.

17:07.641 --> 17:09.744
And also, can you get
blueberries?

17:19.127 --> 17:20.716
Can I help you?

17:20.829 --> 17:25.461
Yeah, I need condoms,
sexual lubricant,

17:25.581 --> 17:28.090
Vagitine, and blueberries.

17:28.203 --> 17:31.493
Lubricant, aisle seven,
Vagitine, aisle three,

17:31.613 --> 17:34.375
next to the tampons,
condoms behind the counter.

17:34.495 --> 17:35.663
We ain't got no blueberries.

17:35.776 --> 17:37.010
Thank you.

17:43.706 --> 17:44.785
Hello?

17:45.570 --> 17:47.242
Yeah, no, I got it.

17:47.355 --> 17:48.810
They don't have
blueberries, though.

17:48.923 --> 17:50.823
Well, can you go to the deli
on seventh?

17:50.943 --> 17:52.481
It's only a block away.

17:52.594 --> 17:55.240
Delores, listen, I--

17:55.360 --> 17:56.919
Please, get blueberries.

18:00.134 --> 18:01.757
Okay.

18:01.870 --> 18:03.337
All right, I'll see you in a bit.

18:14.983 --> 18:16.839
Oh, daddy !

18:16.952 --> 18:17.973
Oh!
What?

18:18.086 --> 18:19.708
Oh, please!

18:19.821 --> 18:21.677
Yeah.
Please, yeah!

18:21.790 --> 18:23.245
Oh!

18:23.358 --> 18:26.549
Just hit me, please.

18:26.662 --> 18:28.151
Uh...

18:28.264 --> 18:30.561
Please, spank me and I'll
suck you off, I promise.

18:32.701 --> 18:34.657
You want me to--

18:34.770 --> 18:36.191
You want me to spank you?

18:36.304 --> 18:37.772
Yes, daddy, please.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.664
Oh!

18:41.777 --> 18:43.232
Daddy.

18:43.345 --> 18:46.502
Oh, daddy!

18:46.615 --> 18:48.538
Daddy, I'm so bad!

18:48.651 --> 18:49.472
Yeah.

18:49.585 --> 18:51.240
Yeah, spank me!

18:51.353 --> 18:52.475
Yeah, huh.

18:52.588 --> 18:53.910
Bad.
Oh, daddy!

18:54.023 --> 18:55.868
Oh, I'm so sorry!

18:57.339 --> 18:57.947
Hit me!

18:58.060 --> 18:59.515
Yeah!
Oh, daddy!

18:59.628 --> 19:00.883
Bad, you're bad, huh?

19:00.996 --> 19:02.219
Oh, daddy!
You're bad...

19:02.332 --> 19:03.353
Daddy!

19:05.168 --> 19:06.601
Shouldn't have
done that, huh?

19:09.605 --> 19:12.107
Oh, daddy!

19:13.742 --> 19:15.443
Hey.

19:21.038 --> 19:24.479
Oh, daddy, I'm so sorry!

19:47.130 --> 19:48.983
Oh, daddy!

19:56.120 --> 19:58.267
Do you think that--

19:59.738 --> 20:01.635
Have you thought about
middle schools?

20:08.837 --> 20:11.219
I was hanging out
with a couple that I know...

20:11.339 --> 20:13.910
And they're married. They're 43 like me
and they're married.

20:14.030 --> 20:17.036
It's pretty much once you're 43
you're either married, you're divorced....

20:17.371 --> 20:21.224
You don't really... After 43,
the window's closed. You're staying.

20:21.738 --> 20:22.915
And...

20:23.194 --> 20:26.606
It's true...That's...Nobody cares
that you're relating to this, shut up.

20:26.944 --> 20:30.165
It's not interesting or important.
I don't care.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.495
I get it. You're all well dressed,
you all work together.

20:33.615 --> 20:37.817
No, no. You're not get at the focus
of this show. You're just not, just shut up.

20:39.534 --> 20:43.739
No one's gonna want to watch a TV show
about that I talk to some guy who's

20:43.859 --> 20:47.021
all his friends took him out.
"Come on." No. Shut up.

20:47.891 --> 20:51.097
I'd rather there was an empty table here.
And there will be if you don't shut up.

20:51.509 --> 20:53.642
All right, so anyway...

20:53.906 --> 20:57.465
Here's what happens... 43...
