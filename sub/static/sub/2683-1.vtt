01:51.053 --> 01:53.806
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich?

01:54.306 --> 01:55.975
I'll get drive-through.

02:37.308 --> 02:40.770
You're counting on the Winged Avenger
to deliver you from evil...

02:40.854 --> 02:42.606
...aren't you, my friend?

02:44.024 --> 02:45.817
Are you going to kill me?

02:46.109 --> 02:49.571
Maybe, maybe not.
We're of two minds on the subject.

02:52.116 --> 02:53.784
Are you a gambling man?

02:54.952 --> 02:56.871
Let's say we flip for it?

02:57.955 --> 03:01.042
One man is born a hero,
his brother a coward.

03:01.292 --> 03:04.045
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...

03:04.962 --> 03:08.299
...holy men are martyred,
and junkies grow legion.

03:09.133 --> 03:10.259
Why?

03:10.968 --> 03:13.012
Why, why, why, why, why?

03:14.180 --> 03:15.348
Luck!

03:15.890 --> 03:18.392
Blind, stupid, simple, doo-dah...

03:19.727 --> 03:21.437
...clueless luck!

03:24.732 --> 03:26.400
The random toss...

03:27.652 --> 03:29.570
...is the only true justice.

03:29.654 --> 03:32.407
Let's see what justice has in store...

03:33.659 --> 03:34.910
...for you.

03:40.165 --> 03:42.167
It's like the touch of God.

03:42.376 --> 03:44.086
Wait, wait, wait.

03:47.172 --> 03:49.591
Fortune smiles.
Another day of wine and roses.

03:49.675 --> 03:51.635
In your case, beer and pizza.

03:52.135 --> 03:53.720
Out of here, guys!

03:53.887 --> 03:56.849
-But you said you'd let me live!
-Too true!

03:57.182 --> 04:00.853
And so you shall! Nothing's better
than live bait to trap a bat.

04:16.202 --> 04:17.620
Hot entrance.

04:18.370 --> 04:19.372
Two-Face?

04:19.454 --> 04:20.623
Two guards are dead.

04:20.707 --> 04:23.126
He's holding a third hostage.
Didn't see this one coming.

04:23.209 --> 04:24.627
We should have.

04:24.794 --> 04:26.462
The Second Bank of Gotham--

04:26.546 --> 04:28.798
Second anniversary
of the day I captured him.

04:28.882 --> 04:30.383
How could he resist?

04:30.466 --> 04:31.885
I'm Chase Meridian.

04:31.968 --> 04:36.431
I asked her to come here to consult
on the case. She specializes in--

04:36.639 --> 04:39.976
Abnormal psychology,
multiple personalities. I read your work.

04:40.059 --> 04:41.186
Insightful.

04:41.269 --> 04:42.896
Naive, but insightful.

04:43.062 --> 04:46.816
I'm flattered. Not every girl
makes a superhero's night table.

04:46.983 --> 04:48.401
Can we reason with him?

04:48.484 --> 04:51.404
-He's got innocent people up there.
-It won't do any good.

04:51.487 --> 04:54.158
-He'll slaughter them without a thought.
-Agreed.

04:54.241 --> 04:57.870
A trauma powerful enough to create
an alternate personality leaves one--

04:57.953 --> 05:00.915
In a world where normal rules
of right and wrong no longer apply.

05:00.998 --> 05:01.999
Exactly.

05:02.082 --> 05:03.250
Like you.

05:04.168 --> 05:08.506
I could write a hell of a paper on a man
who dresses like a flying rodent.

05:10.090 --> 05:12.301
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

05:12.927 --> 05:15.095
Really? I didn't know that.

05:15.679 --> 05:17.223
You are interesting.

05:19.683 --> 05:21.435
And call me Chase.

05:23.687 --> 05:27.107
By the way, do you have a first name,
or do I call you Bats?

05:33.198 --> 05:35.367
Let's start this party with a bang!

05:44.709 --> 05:47.379
Very punctual, even for his own funeral.
Boys!

05:48.004 --> 05:49.506
Kill the Bat!

06:01.059 --> 06:02.269
Blast him!

06:15.074 --> 06:16.534
Open sesame.

07:21.558 --> 07:23.018
It's a trap!

07:57.220 --> 07:59.764
Attention citizens of fair Gotham!

08:03.059 --> 08:06.646
When we open that safe,
we'll have everything we ever wanted:

08:06.813 --> 08:11.234
Enough cash to rain down upon
fair Gotham, a glorious flood of chaos.

08:11.651 --> 08:13.362
And, of course...

08:13.654 --> 08:15.239
...you, my boy, dead!

08:19.159 --> 08:20.911
It's boiling acid!

08:22.162 --> 08:27.042
For your dying pleasure, we are serving
the acid that made us the men we are!

08:27.126 --> 08:28.085
No!

08:30.921 --> 08:32.214
-Hold on.
-Yes!

08:35.217 --> 08:36.467
Haul away!

08:37.010 --> 08:38.679
Yes! Haul away!

08:44.184 --> 08:46.562
-Give me your hand.
-Don't let go!

08:52.193 --> 08:53.945
I must borrow this.

08:57.365 --> 08:59.242
That's my hearing aid!

08:59.409 --> 09:00.577
Thanks.

09:04.706 --> 09:06.875
Wow! My shoes are melting!

09:17.052 --> 09:18.345
No more!

09:34.111 --> 09:35.112
Hang on.

09:35.279 --> 09:36.447
Hang on?

09:58.302 --> 09:59.637
Get him down.

09:59.804 --> 10:01.097
Get him down.

10:02.139 --> 10:04.058
Take it easy with him.

10:04.308 --> 10:06.644
You'll be all right. Just stay calm.

10:18.824 --> 10:20.450
This'll fix him!

10:27.165 --> 10:28.458
Hang on, Batty!

10:49.521 --> 10:50.689
Let's see.

10:51.315 --> 10:52.441
Yes!

10:52.816 --> 10:55.820
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Oh, happy day!

10:58.072 --> 10:59.782
Farewell forever to that...

10:59.866 --> 11:01.993
...pointy-eared night rat!

11:04.537 --> 11:05.705
Face!

11:30.188 --> 11:32.190
You need help. Give it up.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.424
Have the good taste to die!

11:58.926 --> 12:00.219
See you!

12:40.927 --> 12:43.680
Despite a valiant effort
last night by Batman...

12:43.763 --> 12:47.726
...Harvey Two-Face is still at large
and extremely dangerous.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.227
In other news today...

12:49.311 --> 12:52.564
...billionaire Bruce Wayne extended
his profit-sharing program...

12:52.647 --> 12:57.570
...to the employees of the successful
electronics branch of Wayne Enterprises.

13:08.331 --> 13:09.624
Mr. Wayne.

13:11.334 --> 13:14.003
Your inspections are
a departmental highlight.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.547
Oh, my God, it's him.

13:18.132 --> 13:20.134
I am a winner. I am a winner.

13:20.301 --> 13:21.761
I am a winner.

13:22.220 --> 13:23.679
I am a winner.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.351
Bioremediation. Alternative fuel.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.603
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.

13:30.686 --> 13:34.107
Perhaps we should get to R & D
as soon as possible.

13:35.359 --> 13:36.652
Mister...?

13:37.528 --> 13:39.196
Oh, Bruce Wayne.

13:40.364 --> 13:42.866
No, that's my name. And you are?

13:43.492 --> 13:44.493
Nygma.

13:44.660 --> 13:45.661
Edward.

13:45.786 --> 13:48.330
Edward Nygma. You hired me personally.

13:48.664 --> 13:50.791
Just like I tell everyone.

13:51.041 --> 13:55.796
We've never actually met, but your name
was on the hiring slip. I have it.

13:57.047 --> 13:58.632
I need that hand back.

13:59.550 --> 14:01.343
Oh, yes, of course.

14:01.635 --> 14:03.011
I'm sorry.

14:03.303 --> 14:04.847
It's just that...

14:06.056 --> 14:07.641
...you're my idol.

14:07.808 --> 14:08.767
Back to work.

14:08.851 --> 14:11.812
And some people have been trying
to keep us apart.

14:12.563 --> 14:14.064
Back to work.

14:14.315 --> 14:15.441
It's okay.

14:15.733 --> 14:17.569
What's on your mind?

14:17.735 --> 14:19.070
Precisely.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.155
What's on all our minds?

14:21.739 --> 14:23.157
Brain waves.

14:27.579 --> 14:29.080
The future...

14:29.289 --> 14:31.332
...of Wayne Enterprises...

14:32.333 --> 14:34.043
...is brain waves.

14:35.670 --> 14:37.589
I must apologize, Mr. Wayne.

14:37.755 --> 14:40.758
-I terminated his project today.
-It's okay.

14:41.092 --> 14:42.176
I have it!

14:51.769 --> 14:53.354
My invention...

14:53.521 --> 14:57.026
...beams any TV signal directly
into the human brain.

14:57.860 --> 15:01.197
By stimulating neurons,
manipulating brain waves...

15:01.780 --> 15:06.118
...this device makes the audience
feel like they're inside the show.

15:07.620 --> 15:10.206
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?

15:10.372 --> 15:13.167
Did you say "manipulating brain waves"?

15:16.545 --> 15:17.630
Yes.

15:18.464 --> 15:19.673
But...

15:20.049 --> 15:22.927
...someone like you would never need it.

15:23.636 --> 15:25.137
Someone so...

15:25.721 --> 15:27.640
...intelligent, witty and...

15:28.933 --> 15:30.226
...charming.

15:30.643 --> 15:35.357
I need a bit of additional funding
for human trials. Let me show you, please!

15:35.482 --> 15:36.650
Now, listen...

15:36.733 --> 15:39.819
...l want a full set of technical schematics
on this, okay?

15:39.903 --> 15:42.405
We'll be full partners in this, Bruce.

15:42.572 --> 15:44.741
Look at us! Two of a kind!

15:45.575 --> 15:48.870
You call my assistant, Margaret.
She'll set something up.

15:49.913 --> 15:51.081
That's not...

15:51.164 --> 15:53.333
...going to be good for me.

15:54.084 --> 15:55.919
I need an answer now.

15:56.836 --> 15:58.588
I think I deserve it.

15:59.172 --> 16:01.508
I'm sorry, then the answer is no.

16:02.759 --> 16:05.011
Tampering with people's brain waves...

16:05.095 --> 16:06.763
...mind manipulation...

16:07.514 --> 16:10.100
...it just raises too many questions.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.768
Sorry.

16:12.185 --> 16:15.314
Thanks, keep up the good work.
The factory looks great.

16:15.398 --> 16:16.774
All right, everyone!

16:16.858 --> 16:18.192
Back to work!

16:18.401 --> 16:20.403
We'll discuss this later!

16:24.866 --> 16:27.285
You were supposed to understand.

16:31.622 --> 16:33.708
I'll make you understand.

16:38.629 --> 16:39.797
Lock.

16:46.262 --> 16:47.430
Chair.

16:57.274 --> 16:58.692
I saw the signal.

16:58.775 --> 17:00.027
All is ready.

17:40.735 --> 17:41.861
Commissioner?

17:41.945 --> 17:43.196
He's at home.

17:44.781 --> 17:46.533
I sent the signal.

17:47.700 --> 17:48.952
What's wrong?

17:51.788 --> 17:55.124
Last night at the bank I noticed
something about Two-Face:

17:55.208 --> 17:56.292
His coin.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.545
It's his Achilles' heel.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.213
It can be exploited.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.506
I know.

18:01.965 --> 18:03.633
You called me for this?

18:03.716 --> 18:05.718
The Batsignal is not a beeper.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.305
I wish I could say that my interest
in you was...

18:09.514 --> 18:11.224
...purely professional.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.643
Are you trying to get under my cape?

18:13.977 --> 18:16.689
A girl can't live by psychoses alone.

18:17.022 --> 18:19.525
It's the car, right? Chicks love it.

18:20.985 --> 18:23.404
What is it about the wrong kind of man?

18:23.988 --> 18:26.323
In grade school: guys with earrings.

18:26.532 --> 18:29.243
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.

18:30.244 --> 18:31.412
Now...

18:34.957 --> 18:36.625
...black rubber.

18:37.418 --> 18:39.670
Try a fireman. Less to take off.

18:42.131 --> 18:45.551
I don't mind the work.
Pity I can't see behind the mask.

18:46.010 --> 18:47.428
We all wear masks.

18:47.595 --> 18:50.139
My life's an open book. You read?

18:51.056 --> 18:53.684
I don't blend in at a family picnic.

18:54.685 --> 18:57.814
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine...

18:59.024 --> 19:01.193
...you bring your scarred psyche.

19:03.570 --> 19:04.988
Direct, aren't you?

19:05.071 --> 19:06.489
You like strong women.

19:06.573 --> 19:08.366
I've done my homework.

19:08.575 --> 19:11.453
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?

19:12.621 --> 19:14.956
I haven't had much luck with women.

19:15.290 --> 19:18.084
Maybe you just haven't met
the right woman.

19:24.466 --> 19:25.508
I saw the signal.

19:25.592 --> 19:27.469
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.888
False alarm.

19:30.639 --> 19:32.098
Are you sure?

19:51.077 --> 19:52.078
Women.

20:02.171 --> 20:03.839
Now I've got it!

20:07.134 --> 20:09.929
"Too many questions.
There's too many questions.

20:10.096 --> 20:11.556
"Too many...."

20:12.848 --> 20:14.600
I'll show you it works!

20:14.767 --> 20:17.145
What the hell is going on here?

20:17.521 --> 20:21.441
I told you this project is terminated!
I'm calling Security!

20:27.698 --> 20:29.700
Caffeine will kill you!

20:34.246 --> 20:36.707
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.

20:36.874 --> 20:38.375
What are you doing?

20:38.542 --> 20:39.626
Untie me!

20:39.793 --> 20:41.169
This won't hurt.

20:41.545 --> 20:43.630
At least, I don't think it will.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.425
What are you doing?

20:47.551 --> 20:49.303
You touch that switch and--

20:49.386 --> 20:50.345
This?

21:06.154 --> 21:07.614
Losing resolution.

21:08.156 --> 21:09.407
More power!

21:33.181 --> 21:34.557
Edward Nygma...

21:34.641 --> 21:35.808
...come on down!

21:35.892 --> 21:37.978
You're the next contestant on...

21:38.062 --> 21:39.647
...Brain Drain!

21:42.107 --> 21:45.236
I'll take what's inside
thick skull number one!

21:45.444 --> 21:47.446
What have we got for him?

21:48.030 --> 21:50.908
Oh, Stickley, I'm having a breakthrough!

21:51.951 --> 21:53.619
And a breakdown? Maybe!

21:53.869 --> 21:56.664
Nevertheless, I'm smarter. I'm a genius.

21:56.956 --> 21:58.832
No, several geniuses.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.043
A gaggle, a swarm...

22:01.460 --> 22:03.796
...a flock of freaking Freuds!

22:05.214 --> 22:07.091
Riddle me this, Fred.

22:07.967 --> 22:09.802
What is everything to someone...

22:09.885 --> 22:12.054
...and nothing to everyone else?

22:12.555 --> 22:14.223
Your mind, baby!

22:14.473 --> 22:17.269
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!

22:17.727 --> 22:19.646
"I'm sucking up your IQ

22:21.189 --> 22:22.858
"Vacuuming your cortex

22:23.024 --> 22:24.818
"Feeding off your brain"

22:50.886 --> 22:52.345
What a rush!

22:54.306 --> 22:56.224
What the hell just happened?

22:58.686 --> 23:01.022
A very surprising side effect.

23:01.898 --> 23:04.775
While you were mesmerized
by my 3-D TV...

23:05.860 --> 23:08.738
...l utilized your neural energy
to grow smarter.

23:08.863 --> 23:10.781
Bruce Wayne was right!

23:11.574 --> 23:14.327
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!

23:15.077 --> 23:17.038
It is brain manipulation!

23:17.330 --> 23:19.540
I'm reporting you to the FCC!

23:19.707 --> 23:22.335
The human experimentation board!
The AMl!

23:22.543 --> 23:23.794
And the police!

23:23.878 --> 23:25.880
You are going up on charges...

23:26.047 --> 23:27.715
...to court, to jail...

23:27.924 --> 23:31.010
...and then to a mental institution
for the rest of your life!

23:31.093 --> 23:34.096
But, first and foremost,
Nygma, you are fired!

23:34.263 --> 23:36.265
Do you hear me? Fired!

23:42.064 --> 23:43.774
I don't think so.

23:57.621 --> 23:58.789
Help!

24:03.126 --> 24:04.419
Hang on!

24:09.132 --> 24:10.300
Babe!

24:10.759 --> 24:12.302
You are fired!

24:12.928 --> 24:14.471
Or should I say...

24:15.389 --> 24:16.641
...terminated?

24:21.980 --> 24:23.898
Surf's up, Big Kahuna!

24:28.278 --> 24:30.613
Nice form, but rough on the landing.

24:30.780 --> 24:33.491
He may have to settle for the Bronze.

24:38.329 --> 24:40.206
"Questions," Mr. Wayne?

24:41.499 --> 24:44.043
My work raises too many questions?

24:45.128 --> 24:47.005
Why hasn't anybody...

24:48.798 --> 24:50.884
...put you in your place?

24:52.760 --> 24:55.305
Harvey Dent,
once Gotham's District Attorney...

24:55.388 --> 24:59.018
...was horribly scarred
by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.

24:59.184 --> 25:01.478
Although Batman tried to save him...

25:01.687 --> 25:05.774
...Dent's left-brain damage
turned him into a violent criminal...

25:05.941 --> 25:09.278
...who blamed Batman
and who has vowed to destroy him.

25:09.486 --> 25:13.073
Harvey Two-Face is extremely dangerous,
repeat, extremely dangerous.

25:13.157 --> 25:14.992
That was the Commissioner.

25:15.159 --> 25:18.287
There's been an accident
at Wayne Enterprises.

25:19.788 --> 25:21.415
Horrible way to die.

25:21.665 --> 25:23.834
The surveillance cameras are down here.

25:23.918 --> 25:28.130
We'll dredge the river, but with
that current, I doubt we'll find the body.

25:31.675 --> 25:32.801
Why?

25:33.052 --> 25:34.345
Oh, why?

25:37.224 --> 25:39.184
I just can't believe it.

25:39.476 --> 25:42.187
Two years working in the same office.

25:43.021 --> 25:44.940
He was like my father...

25:45.065 --> 25:46.441
...my brother...

25:46.691 --> 25:49.027
...or a cousin that visits a lot.

25:49.402 --> 25:51.196
Get a grip, Edward.

25:53.365 --> 25:55.158
I found this in my cubicle.

25:55.242 --> 25:59.704
You'll find the handwriting matches his,
as does the sentence structure.

26:03.500 --> 26:06.211
I couldn't possibly continue on here.

26:07.504 --> 26:09.172
The memories....

26:11.216 --> 26:13.718
This is last night's security log.

26:14.219 --> 26:15.720
There's Stickley.

26:21.769 --> 26:23.437
Pretty cut and dry.

26:29.443 --> 26:31.487
Yes, definitely suicide.

26:32.780 --> 26:36.075
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce.
We'll be in touch.

26:39.579 --> 26:44.292
Stickley's suicide doesn't make sense.
I want full benefits for his family.

26:44.458 --> 26:47.169
Suicide's not covered
by our corporate insurance policy.

26:47.253 --> 26:48.921
I know. Full benefits.

26:49.088 --> 26:53.092
Gossip Gerty called 32 times.
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?

26:53.259 --> 26:55.344
I'll let you know. What's this?

26:56.095 --> 26:57.347
I don't know.

26:57.431 --> 26:59.266
I didn't see anyone.

27:08.609 --> 27:11.445
"If you look at the numbers on my face...

27:11.570 --> 27:13.947
"...you won't find 13 anyplace."

27:14.448 --> 27:15.741
That's hideous.

27:16.033 --> 27:17.492
What does it mean?

27:17.826 --> 27:19.036
It's a riddle.

27:19.119 --> 27:21.246
"Numbers on my face...13."

27:22.164 --> 27:23.665
One through twelve.

27:23.790 --> 27:25.459
The answer is a clock.

27:25.584 --> 27:27.794
Who would send you a riddle?

27:28.337 --> 27:29.630
That, Maggie...

27:29.838 --> 27:31.340
...is the riddle.

28:15.635 --> 28:17.345
Guess what I did today?

28:44.582 --> 28:46.041
Wayne Manor.

28:56.010 --> 28:57.511
See you soon.

29:28.543 --> 29:31.046
Dr. Meridian, please. Thank you.

30:02.328 --> 30:03.871
I...guess I'm early.

30:05.915 --> 30:07.583
I have an appointment.

30:07.792 --> 30:09.210
I'm Bruce Wayne.

30:09.794 --> 30:10.962
Good.

30:11.212 --> 30:13.756
Then you can afford to buy me a new door.

30:14.340 --> 30:15.675
I'm sorry.

30:19.680 --> 30:22.182
You...sounded like you were in...

30:27.271 --> 30:29.022
...you know, trouble.

30:30.232 --> 30:34.027
I prefer healthy expressions of violence
as opposed to breaking in.

30:35.362 --> 30:36.446
So...

30:36.822 --> 30:38.740
...how can I help you?

30:41.618 --> 30:44.413
Someone's been sending me love letters.

30:44.746 --> 30:47.374
One at my office and one at my home.

30:49.251 --> 30:52.838
Commissioner Gordon thought
you might give me your opinion.

30:58.051 --> 30:59.304
A clock.

30:59.470 --> 31:00.471
Clock.

31:03.766 --> 31:06.311
"Tear one off and scratch my head.

31:07.812 --> 31:10.523
"What once was red is black instead."

31:12.859 --> 31:14.152
A match.

31:19.282 --> 31:21.868
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.

31:22.410 --> 31:23.494
"Wacko?"

31:24.078 --> 31:25.830
Is that a technical term?

31:26.331 --> 31:28.958
Patient may suffer from obsession...

31:29.167 --> 31:33.171
...with potential homicidal tendencies.
Is that better for you?

31:33.504 --> 31:35.256
So, what you're saying is...

31:35.340 --> 31:37.258
...this guy's a total wacko.

31:37.342 --> 31:38.636
Exactly.

31:40.429 --> 31:42.097
He's obsessed with you.

31:42.181 --> 31:45.184
His only escape may be
to purge the fixation.

31:46.769 --> 31:48.020
To kill me.

31:48.687 --> 31:51.899
I think you understand obsession
better than you let on.

31:55.361 --> 31:56.695
You like bats?

31:57.821 --> 31:59.782
That's a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.

31:59.907 --> 32:01.325
An inkblot.

32:01.450 --> 32:03.202
People see what they want.

32:04.328 --> 32:06.830
The question is: do you like bats?

32:09.333 --> 32:11.418
Still playing with dolls?

32:12.795 --> 32:15.047
She's a Malaysian dream warden.

32:15.381 --> 32:18.552
Some cultures believe she protects you
from bad dreams.

32:19.386 --> 32:21.471
It's silly to you, I'm sure.

32:26.268 --> 32:27.852
You look so sad.

32:29.396 --> 32:30.730
Do you need one?

32:31.523 --> 32:33.441
Me? No. Why would l?

32:35.860 --> 32:38.780
You're not exactly what you seem,
are you?

32:40.156 --> 32:42.409
What is it you really came here for?

32:44.703 --> 32:46.413
Yikes, time's up.

32:48.540 --> 32:50.292
That's usually my line.

32:50.542 --> 32:52.544
I'd love to stay here chatting--

32:52.627 --> 32:54.004
Would you?

32:54.880 --> 32:56.214
I'm not so sure.

32:56.923 --> 32:59.468
I must get you out of those clothes.

33:00.469 --> 33:01.804
Excuse me?

33:01.929 --> 33:03.890
And into a black dress.

33:04.056 --> 33:06.767
Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?

33:25.369 --> 33:27.371
Ladies and gentlemen...

33:28.623 --> 33:30.791
...boys and girls of all ages...

33:30.917 --> 33:33.628
...welcome to the greatest show on earth!

33:33.794 --> 33:36.631
Who is this beautiful young woman
you're with?

33:36.797 --> 33:38.216
Dr. Chase Meridian.

33:38.299 --> 33:39.384
A doctor?

33:39.551 --> 33:41.220
What kind of doctor?

33:41.386 --> 33:43.555
...for Gotham Children's Hospital.

33:43.639 --> 33:46.350
Let's thank our largest single donor:

33:47.267 --> 33:48.727
Bruce Wayne!

33:51.104 --> 33:52.940
Ladies and gentlemen...

33:53.565 --> 33:55.734
...70 feet above the ground...

33:55.901 --> 33:59.321
...performing feats
of unimaginable aerial skill...

33:59.947 --> 34:01.949
...the Flying Graysons!

34:56.379 --> 34:57.380
Listen...

34:57.463 --> 35:01.260
...l'm going rock climbing this weekend.
Would you like to join me?

35:02.303 --> 35:03.762
I'd like to.

35:04.221 --> 35:06.807
I love climbing. I really love it.

35:07.224 --> 35:08.100
But?

35:08.893 --> 35:10.311
I've met someone.

35:11.562 --> 35:14.023
That's fast work. You just moved here.

35:14.231 --> 35:15.900
You could say he just...

35:16.025 --> 35:18.444
...dropped out of the sky and...

35:18.903 --> 35:19.987
...bang!

35:21.572 --> 35:23.282
I think he felt it too.

35:23.407 --> 35:24.617
He sure did.

35:24.825 --> 35:25.743
What?

35:27.578 --> 35:28.829
Who wouldn't?

35:30.247 --> 35:31.248
Now...

35:32.917 --> 35:34.043
...Richard...

35:34.126 --> 35:36.629
...the youngest Flying Grayson...

35:37.421 --> 35:39.674
...will perform the awe-inspiring...

35:39.758 --> 35:41.134
...death drop...

35:43.011 --> 35:44.554
...without the safety...

35:44.638 --> 35:45.847
...of a net!

36:04.908 --> 36:06.243
Let's go.

36:06.576 --> 36:07.869
You'll be okay.

36:42.863 --> 36:44.198
Ladies...

36:44.490 --> 36:46.033
...and gentlemen!

36:47.201 --> 36:50.872
Now, the new management
of the circus invites you to forget...

36:51.038 --> 36:53.374
...this good, wholesome fun...

36:53.583 --> 36:56.252
...andjoin us in a celebration
of absolute chaos...

36:56.335 --> 36:58.170
...and truejesters!

36:59.088 --> 37:00.549
Bring it on!

37:01.091 --> 37:02.092
Now!

37:13.687 --> 37:16.023
Tonight, a new act for your...

37:16.148 --> 37:20.110
...personal amazement.
We call it, "Massacre under the Big Top. "

37:21.862 --> 37:24.406
Let us direct your attention to the ring.

37:25.616 --> 37:28.577
Inside this harmless-looking orb are two...

37:29.244 --> 37:31.872
...that's two hundred sticks of TNT.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.209
And in our innocent hand...

37:35.417 --> 37:37.294
...a radio detonator.

37:38.045 --> 37:39.755
What do you want?

37:39.923 --> 37:41.549
Want, Mr. Mayor?

37:41.758 --> 37:43.635
One simple thing: Batman.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.762
Bruised, broken, bleeding...

37:45.929 --> 37:47.639
...in a word: dead!

37:52.143 --> 37:53.394
Batman.

37:53.603 --> 37:55.605
Who do we have before us?

37:55.939 --> 37:57.357
Gotham's finest...

37:57.690 --> 37:58.858
...well-to-do...

37:58.942 --> 38:00.068
...influential.

38:00.151 --> 38:02.528
Surely one ofyou knows who Batman is.

38:02.612 --> 38:06.199
Hell, odds are one ofyou pasty-faced twits
is Batman!

38:07.242 --> 38:09.118
You have two minutes.

38:15.708 --> 38:16.960
Harvey!

38:17.710 --> 38:19.128
I'm Batman!

38:38.315 --> 38:39.525
We can stop them.

38:39.608 --> 38:40.901
Go out on the rigging.

38:40.985 --> 38:41.735
Be careful.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.028
Don't worry.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.674
Go to work, boys!

39:24.654 --> 39:26.323
Our kind of day.

39:35.457 --> 39:37.250
Reach for it! Stop it!

39:43.341 --> 39:44.467
Oh, my God.

41:25.111 --> 41:28.281
It's good you took him in.
He hasn't anyone now.

41:28.448 --> 41:32.076
He's filled out papers all day.
He hasn't slept or eaten.

41:43.923 --> 41:45.674
Welcome, Master Grayson.

41:45.758 --> 41:46.926
I'm Alfred.

41:47.384 --> 41:48.969
How're you doing, Al?

41:50.387 --> 41:54.808
There's a room prepared for you.
But perhaps you'd like to eat first.

41:57.144 --> 41:59.063
Okay, I'm out of here.

42:00.981 --> 42:02.066
Excuse me?

42:02.149 --> 42:04.401
Telling that cop I'd stay here...

42:04.610 --> 42:07.780
...saved me a lot
of social-service interviews.

42:08.155 --> 42:10.658
So, no offense, but no thanks. See you.

42:10.950 --> 42:12.409
Take it easy.

42:23.964 --> 42:27.842
Where will you go? The circus
must be halfway to Metropolis.

42:28.009 --> 42:29.636
Get a fix on Two-Face.

42:29.844 --> 42:31.304
Then I'll kill him.

42:31.846 --> 42:34.474
Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away.

42:34.683 --> 42:36.226
It'll make it worse.

42:36.309 --> 42:38.353
Spare me the sermons, all right?

42:39.145 --> 42:41.690
I don't need your advice or your charity.

42:43.358 --> 42:44.651
Nice bike.

42:44.859 --> 42:47.279
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?

42:49.823 --> 42:51.825
You're almost on empty.

42:51.992 --> 42:55.370
Fill it up in the garage.
There's no gas station for miles.

43:03.212 --> 43:04.797
The pump's over here.

43:04.881 --> 43:07.508
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?

43:16.684 --> 43:18.269
That's a 1917 Harley.

43:18.352 --> 43:19.228
Yep.

43:19.729 --> 43:22.106
Indian Classic, fully restored.

43:22.899 --> 43:24.942
This is a Vincent Black Knight.

43:25.526 --> 43:27.153
They only made a hundred.

43:27.236 --> 43:30.031
A hundred and one, actually.
She's my favorite.

43:30.406 --> 43:31.908
You've got two.

43:32.074 --> 43:33.659
That one doesn't run.

43:34.410 --> 43:36.495
The throttle sticks on this one.

43:36.871 --> 43:39.081
Alfred's a good mechanic, but...

43:39.540 --> 43:41.501
...these need a lot of work.

43:42.044 --> 43:43.837
If someone were to fix them up...

43:43.921 --> 43:45.631
...they could keep one.

43:47.549 --> 43:48.717
Anyway...

43:48.884 --> 43:50.427
...have a nice trip.

43:51.094 --> 43:52.846
You'll land on your feet.

43:56.266 --> 43:58.518
Is the young master leaving?

43:58.769 --> 43:59.937
Pity.

44:00.103 --> 44:03.941
I'll just toss this away then.
Perhaps the dogs are hungry.

44:07.527 --> 44:09.238
Hey, Al, wait up.

46:02.854 --> 46:04.356
Master Bruce?

46:09.653 --> 46:11.529
Just like my parents.

46:12.280 --> 46:14.032
It's happening again.

46:14.950 --> 46:18.536
A monster comes out of the night,
a scream, two shots.

46:20.455 --> 46:21.873
I killed them.

46:22.291 --> 46:23.960
What did you say?

46:24.293 --> 46:25.461
He killed them.

46:25.544 --> 46:26.754
Two-Face.

46:27.046 --> 46:29.298
He slaughtered that boy's parents.

46:29.465 --> 46:30.716
No, no.

46:31.175 --> 46:33.302
You said, "I killed them."

46:45.773 --> 46:47.400
Take care of the kid.

46:47.692 --> 46:49.068
Certainly, sir.

46:57.201 --> 47:00.079
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?

47:00.580 --> 47:01.497
No.

47:01.998 --> 47:04.084
Thanks, I won't be staying long.

47:07.254 --> 47:08.922
Is this a robin?

47:12.092 --> 47:15.804
My brother's wire broke once
and I swung out and grabbed him.

47:17.264 --> 47:19.349
My father said I was his hero.

47:20.809 --> 47:22.811
I flew in like a robin.

47:25.355 --> 47:27.524
Some hero I turned out to be.

47:28.442 --> 47:30.569
But your father was right.

47:30.777 --> 47:33.030
You are a hero. I can tell.

47:40.203 --> 47:43.541
Throw this away, will you?
I won't need it anymore.

47:46.169 --> 47:48.671
I think I'll just put it in here.

47:55.136 --> 47:57.263
Broken wings mend in time.

47:58.848 --> 48:01.142
One day Robin will fly again.

48:01.643 --> 48:02.852
I promise.

49:25.437 --> 49:26.771
We'll drive.

51:00.367 --> 51:01.577
The Puzzler?

51:06.291 --> 51:07.542
The Gamester?

51:14.716 --> 51:16.134
Captain Kill?

51:20.305 --> 51:22.015
Question Mark Man?

51:40.241 --> 51:42.577
Thank you. Thank you so much.

51:56.508 --> 51:59.303
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...

52:00.846 --> 52:02.890
...is driving us insane!

52:06.185 --> 52:07.937
Don't worry, baby.

52:09.521 --> 52:11.398
You'll kill him soon.

52:16.195 --> 52:17.571
Besides...

52:17.947 --> 52:19.865
...l made your favorite:

52:19.990 --> 52:21.992
Sparkling champagne and...

52:22.534 --> 52:26.039
...yummy poached salmon
with little quail eggs and...

52:26.957 --> 52:28.416
...a creamy...

52:28.500 --> 52:29.751
...dreamy...

52:30.085 --> 52:31.795
...lemon souffle.

52:32.379 --> 52:34.464
No, I made your favorite:

52:34.631 --> 52:37.050
A charred heart of black boar...

52:37.467 --> 52:39.844
...a side of raw donkey meat...

52:41.221 --> 52:44.724
...and a Sterno and grain alcohol,
straight up, baby!

52:46.101 --> 52:47.394
Perfect!

52:47.811 --> 52:49.396
Ladies, you spoil us!

52:49.563 --> 52:52.524
We're of two minds about what to eat first.

52:53.608 --> 52:54.526
What?

52:54.609 --> 52:56.236
I hope you made extra.

52:56.611 --> 52:58.238
Who the hell are you?

52:59.281 --> 53:00.824
Just a friend.

53:01.116 --> 53:02.784
But you can call me...

53:03.451 --> 53:05.037
...The Riddler.

53:07.415 --> 53:11.294
I'll call you dead, is more like it!
How did you find us? Talk!

53:11.460 --> 53:15.965
But then if I talked, what would keep you
from slaying me, O Segregated One?

53:16.132 --> 53:19.635
That's never going to heal
if you don't stop picking.

53:21.137 --> 53:23.431
Let's see if you bleed green.

53:24.932 --> 53:26.976
It's not me you want to kill.

53:27.935 --> 53:31.731
That's just too easy for someone
as powerful as you and...

53:32.273 --> 53:33.316
...you.

53:34.150 --> 53:35.401
But Batman...

53:36.986 --> 53:38.988
...there's a challenge.

53:39.322 --> 53:41.824
Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.

53:42.450 --> 53:47.331
But have you thought it through? A few
bullets, a splash of blood, then what?

53:48.290 --> 53:49.666
Wet hands.

53:50.667 --> 53:52.794
Post-homicidal depression.

53:57.090 --> 53:58.967
Why not humiliate him first?

53:59.092 --> 53:59.885
Yeah.

53:59.968 --> 54:03.513
Expose his frailties. Then, when he is
at his weakest...

54:03.805 --> 54:05.307
...crush him!

54:07.684 --> 54:09.186
I see that...

54:09.519 --> 54:11.772
...sparkle in your left eye.

54:12.981 --> 54:15.108
I can help you get Batman.

54:18.320 --> 54:19.863
That is, if you'll...

54:20.113 --> 54:22.824
...spare my life for just a few moments.

54:34.337 --> 54:35.672
Thank you.

54:36.381 --> 54:40.885
I love what you've done with this place.
Heavy Metal meets House and Garden.

54:42.679 --> 54:44.013
Beautiful.

54:44.138 --> 54:46.391
It's so dark and Gothic and...

54:46.891 --> 54:48.977
...disgustingly decadent.

54:50.728 --> 54:53.147
Yet so bright and chipper and...

54:55.024 --> 54:56.568
...conservative.

55:00.572 --> 55:02.031
It's so you!

55:03.032 --> 55:04.702
And yet, so you!

55:07.246 --> 55:10.833
Very few people are both a summer
and a winter, but...

55:12.084 --> 55:14.044
...but you pull it off nicely.

55:16.380 --> 55:18.090
What's the point?

55:19.091 --> 55:23.512
Has anyone ever told you, you have
a serious impulse-control problem?

55:25.264 --> 55:27.016
This is the point.

55:39.737 --> 55:41.780
This is how I found you.

55:42.197 --> 55:43.949
Let me demonstrate.

55:49.956 --> 55:52.250
This is your brain on The Box.

55:52.459 --> 55:54.377
This is my brain on The Box.

55:54.461 --> 55:56.880
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?

55:56.963 --> 55:58.214
I'll have more.

55:58.965 --> 56:02.052
There's more. But only the first one's free.

56:03.136 --> 56:04.763
Here's the bargain:

56:04.930 --> 56:07.599
You'll help me steal production capital...

56:07.766 --> 56:10.602
...so I can put a Box on every TV in town...

56:10.769 --> 56:14.439
...and become Gotham's cleverest,
carbon-based life form!

56:15.815 --> 56:17.484
And in return....

56:19.444 --> 56:21.780
Is everybody paying attention?

56:21.988 --> 56:24.867
I will help you solve the greatest riddle
of all.

56:24.951 --> 56:27.078
The mother of all riddles:

56:28.621 --> 56:29.956
Who is...

56:30.456 --> 56:31.832
...Batman?

56:33.834 --> 56:36.003
You broke into our hideout.

56:36.254 --> 56:38.798
You violated the sanctity of our lair.

56:38.965 --> 56:41.634
We should crush your bones into powder.

56:41.801 --> 56:44.095
But you pose an interesting proposition.

56:44.178 --> 56:48.474
Therefore, heads: we accept,
and tails: we blow your damn head off.

57:03.990 --> 57:05.450
Here's a good one.

57:05.534 --> 57:06.952
No, no, no!

57:07.828 --> 57:09.663
There is a good one.

57:11.164 --> 57:15.210
-Leave that. I'll attend to it.
-I'm not used to being waited on.

57:40.527 --> 57:41.904
Don't shoot me!

57:42.070 --> 57:44.489
Don't eyeball me! Give me that!

57:47.911 --> 57:50.371
Two-Face, show me how to punch a guy!

57:50.580 --> 57:53.833
It's dead simple, my boy.
Ball up your fist, reach back...

57:53.917 --> 57:55.627
...and assert yourself.

57:57.253 --> 57:59.505
That looks fun. Let me try.

58:00.089 --> 58:03.551
Ball up the fist, reach way back...
assert yourself.

58:08.556 --> 58:11.643
One hundred thousand,
two hundred and twenty.

58:12.060 --> 58:13.561
One hundred and....

58:13.728 --> 58:15.230
I lost count!

58:17.106 --> 58:21.527
Last night another robbery,
perpetrated by the Green-Suited Menace...

58:21.736 --> 58:25.324
...resulting in millions in diamonds stolen,
with no sign of Batman.

58:25.407 --> 58:28.244
Teamed with Two-Face,
this new criminal's pattern...

58:28.327 --> 58:32.665
...of marking his crimes with puzzles
has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.

58:33.290 --> 58:36.460
Apparently, you and Batman
have a common enemy.

58:37.127 --> 58:39.129
That was with the morning mail.

58:41.215 --> 58:43.175
"The eight of us go forth, not back.

58:43.259 --> 58:45.886
"To protect our king from the foe's attack."

58:47.263 --> 58:48.222
Chess pawns.

58:48.305 --> 58:49.390
Clock.

58:49.598 --> 58:50.307
Matches.

58:50.391 --> 58:52.226
All physical, man-made objects.

58:52.309 --> 58:54.436
Small in size, light in weight.

58:54.728 --> 58:56.105
What's the connection?

58:56.188 --> 58:59.900
With all due respect,
that's why they call him The Riddler.

59:02.570 --> 59:04.154
May I help you?

59:04.572 --> 59:06.825
Why is this the only locked door?

59:07.325 --> 59:09.077
What's back there?

59:09.244 --> 59:11.371
Master Wayne's dead wives.

59:12.664 --> 59:14.749
The silver closet. On your way.

59:18.336 --> 59:20.922
Now, you can be part of the action!

59:23.008 --> 59:26.970
Nygma Tech brings thejoy
of 3-D entertainment into your home!

59:27.262 --> 59:30.098
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you...

59:30.765 --> 59:32.267
...my vision.

59:33.602 --> 59:36.187
The Box in every home in America...

59:36.688 --> 59:38.481
...and one day, the world!

59:39.190 --> 59:41.943
In local news, Edward Nygma's 3-D Box...

59:42.110 --> 59:44.487
...has become the rage of Gotham.

59:44.696 --> 59:48.784
Rioting occurred last night
at electronic stores that were sold out.

59:49.619 --> 59:52.914
There is hardly a home
without the Nygma Tech Box.

59:53.664 --> 59:56.751
Critics claim The Box turns Gothamites
into zombies.

59:56.959 --> 59:58.669
But Edward Nygmajust shrugs.

59:58.753 --> 01:00:01.756
"That's what they said
when TV was invented. "

01:00:44.925 --> 01:00:46.176
Master Dick!

01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:48.845
Up here.

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.932
Just checking, young sir.

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:23.464
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

01:01:51.619 --> 01:01:54.622
I have something for you. It's on the table.

01:01:55.164 --> 01:01:56.749
I hope you like it.

01:02:07.551 --> 01:02:09.720
Call it clinical intuition.

01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:13.057
I thought your dreams needed changing.

01:02:16.226 --> 01:02:18.604
My parents were murdered before me...

01:02:18.812 --> 01:02:20.481
...when I was a kid.

01:02:23.484 --> 01:02:24.818
I don't...

01:02:25.361 --> 01:02:28.281
...remember a lot of what happened, but...

01:02:29.824 --> 01:02:32.994
...what I do comes to me in my dreams.
Flashes.

01:02:34.162 --> 01:02:37.624
There's a new element now, though,
I haven't seen before.

01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:40.001
It's a red leather book.

01:02:41.503 --> 01:02:43.255
Something else....

01:02:43.505 --> 01:02:46.299
My dreams come to me
when I'm awake now.

01:02:47.634 --> 01:02:50.637
Bruce, you're describing
repressed memories.

01:02:51.429 --> 01:02:54.891
Images of a forgotten pain
that's trying to surface.

01:02:57.978 --> 01:02:59.771
I'll be right back.

01:03:19.959 --> 01:03:24.130
Is it possible there's an aspect
of your parents' death you haven't faced?

01:03:24.297 --> 01:03:26.632
You were so young when it happened.

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:30.261
Maybe I should leave you two alone.

01:03:31.637 --> 01:03:35.224
This goes way beyond taking
your work home, doesn't it?

01:03:38.477 --> 01:03:39.604
All right.

01:03:41.647 --> 01:03:43.566
I think he's fascinating.

01:03:44.233 --> 01:03:45.484
Clinically.

01:03:45.902 --> 01:03:47.696
Why does a man do this?

01:03:48.906 --> 01:03:51.408
It's as if he's cursed to pay a penance.

01:03:51.575 --> 01:03:55.704
What crime could he have committed
to deserve a life of nightly torture?

01:03:56.914 --> 01:03:58.582
It's more than just...

01:03:59.499 --> 01:04:02.294
...professional interest, isn't it, Chase?

01:04:03.253 --> 01:04:04.963
Bruce, are you jealous?

01:04:05.714 --> 01:04:06.798
No.

01:04:07.799 --> 01:04:10.093
I can't be jealous of Batman.

01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:14.473
I want to be close,
but you won't let me near.

01:04:16.308 --> 01:04:18.393
What are you protecting me from?

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.480
Do you want to know me?

01:04:22.314 --> 01:04:24.274
Do you want to know who I am?

01:04:26.193 --> 01:04:27.445
I guess...

01:04:28.321 --> 01:04:30.198
...we're all two people.

01:04:31.658 --> 01:04:34.661
The one in daylight,
and the one we keep in shadow.

01:04:35.954 --> 01:04:37.205
Rage...

01:04:37.455 --> 01:04:38.831
...violence...

01:04:40.041 --> 01:04:41.209
...passion.

01:04:45.463 --> 01:04:46.673
Excuse me.

01:04:48.341 --> 01:04:49.509
I'm busy.

01:04:49.676 --> 01:04:53.846
I'm sorry to bother you.
I have some distressing news about Dick.

01:04:54.305 --> 01:04:55.390
Is he okay?

01:04:55.473 --> 01:04:58.393
I'm afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.

01:04:59.435 --> 01:05:00.687
He ran away?

01:05:00.979 --> 01:05:03.106
Actually, he took the car.

01:05:04.357 --> 01:05:05.858
He boosted the Jag?

01:05:06.234 --> 01:05:07.486
Not the Jaguar.

01:05:07.653 --> 01:05:09.029
The other car.

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:10.239
The Bentley?

01:05:10.322 --> 01:05:11.490
No, sir.

01:05:11.657 --> 01:05:13.200
The other car.

01:05:44.815 --> 01:05:47.736
Come for a little ride
in my love machine, babies?

01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:54.743
It's Batman!

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:56.536
Open up, Batman.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:05:59.205
Wait!

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:00.832
That's not Batman!

01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:02.292
What do you mean?

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:03.919
That's Batboy!

01:06:04.753 --> 01:06:06.254
It ain't the Bat!

01:06:29.528 --> 01:06:30.947
Let her go!

01:06:38.704 --> 01:06:40.373
Who the hell are you?

01:06:40.873 --> 01:06:42.083
I'm Batman.

01:06:44.335 --> 01:06:46.587
I forgot my suit, all right?

01:07:26.795 --> 01:07:28.297
Come on, run!

01:07:28.589 --> 01:07:30.882
Doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?

01:07:33.302 --> 01:07:34.052
Go!

01:07:34.136 --> 01:07:35.887
Thanks, you saved my life!

01:07:36.138 --> 01:07:39.141
I could definitely get
into this superhero gig.

01:08:03.291 --> 01:08:04.542
Batman!

01:08:18.305 --> 01:08:19.599
Bastard!

01:08:19.974 --> 01:08:21.684
It should've been you!

01:08:22.143 --> 01:08:25.479
If you had told Two-Face who you were
at the circus...

01:08:25.688 --> 01:08:27.691
...they'd still be alive!

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:34.865
If Bruce Wayne could've given his life
for your family, he would have.

01:08:40.662 --> 01:08:43.957
All I can think about every day
is getting Two-Face.

01:08:45.209 --> 01:08:47.044
He took my whole life.

01:08:49.337 --> 01:08:51.256
When I was out there tonight...

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:53.591
...l imagined it was him I was fighting...

01:08:53.676 --> 01:08:55.844
...even when I was fighting you...

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.764
...and the pain went away.

01:09:00.224 --> 01:09:01.725
Do you understand?

01:09:01.892 --> 01:09:03.185
Yes, I do.

01:09:03.602 --> 01:09:04.603
Good.

01:09:05.062 --> 01:09:07.022
You must help me find him.

01:09:07.899 --> 01:09:09.149
When we do...

01:09:09.401 --> 01:09:11.361
...l'm the one who kills him.

01:09:12.737 --> 01:09:15.240
So, you're willing to take a life?

01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:17.951
As long as it's Two-Face.

01:09:20.912 --> 01:09:23.206
Then it will happen this way:

01:09:24.416 --> 01:09:25.959
You make the kill.

01:09:27.419 --> 01:09:30.546
But your pain doesn't die with Harvey,
it grows.

01:09:30.714 --> 01:09:34.551
So you run into the night
to find another face, and another...

01:09:35.093 --> 01:09:36.511
...and another...

01:09:37.304 --> 01:09:40.724
...until one terrible morning
you wake up and realize...

01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:43.560
...that revenge has become
your whole life...

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.812
...and you won't know why.

01:09:47.063 --> 01:09:48.899
You can't understand.

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:51.777
Your family wasn't killed by a maniac.

01:09:53.029 --> 01:09:54.614
Yes, they were.

01:09:55.823 --> 01:09:57.325
We're the same.

01:09:57.742 --> 01:10:01.704
If we're the same, help me.
Train me, let me be your partner.

01:10:04.457 --> 01:10:05.541
No.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.293
I can't.

01:10:08.085 --> 01:10:10.087
You still have a choice.

01:10:10.838 --> 01:10:12.048
Look, Bruce...

01:10:12.256 --> 01:10:15.176
...l'm a part of this, whether you like it
or not.

01:10:32.819 --> 01:10:37.074
Tonight all of Gotham society
has turned out for Edward Nygma's...

01:10:37.491 --> 01:10:40.410
...gala unveiling of his New lmproved Box.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:42.788
Thanks, Al.

01:10:42.955 --> 01:10:44.039
My pleasure, sir.

01:10:44.122 --> 01:10:46.750
They'll be dining
and dancing the night away...

01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:49.836
...on the glamorous roof
of the Ritz Gotham.

01:11:01.014 --> 01:11:04.643
What's it like to have your face
on the cover of every magazine?

01:11:05.644 --> 01:11:10.275
Edward, how does it feel to be
the city's newest, most-eligible bachelor?

01:11:10.984 --> 01:11:12.694
Gotham must know!

01:11:13.653 --> 01:11:15.488
There's Bruce Wayne!

01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:17.490
Brucie!

01:11:18.992 --> 01:11:21.119
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!

01:11:22.704 --> 01:11:24.998
How come you don't look so good
in that suit?

01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:27.417
Shut up. You're here to work!

01:11:28.126 --> 01:11:29.294
How's my mole?

01:11:29.377 --> 01:11:30.545
Fine.

01:11:31.004 --> 01:11:34.007
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech
takeover of Wayne Enterprises?

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:37.427
Nygma Tech stock is outselling
Wayne Enterprises two to one.

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:39.929
Are you yesterday's news, Bruce?

01:11:41.389 --> 01:11:42.974
Bruce, old man.

01:11:43.516 --> 01:11:48.397
The press wonders what it's like
to be outsold, outclassed, out-coifed and...

01:11:49.148 --> 01:11:51.317
...generally outdone in every way.

01:11:52.151 --> 01:11:54.236
Hello, Edward. Congratulations.

01:11:54.695 --> 01:11:56.739
Great party. Nice suit.

01:11:57.364 --> 01:11:58.782
Wit. Good.

01:12:00.242 --> 01:12:01.452
And you are?

01:12:01.535 --> 01:12:02.453
Chase.

01:12:04.204 --> 01:12:06.916
And what a grand pursuit you must be.

01:12:09.877 --> 01:12:11.629
I'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...?

01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:15.674
You can call me anything you want.

01:12:17.551 --> 01:12:19.261
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:12:19.595 --> 01:12:21.138
...the future!

01:12:21.597 --> 01:12:25.893
My New lmproved Box offers
fully-interactive holographic fantasies.

01:12:46.206 --> 01:12:48.833
Edward, you're dashing and a genius.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.587
How do you create these images, hon?

01:12:53.129 --> 01:12:55.715
That, my dear, is my little secret.

01:13:03.265 --> 01:13:05.225
Fully-interactive holographs.

01:13:05.392 --> 01:13:08.813
Only a high-frequency carrier wave,
beamed into the brain...

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:10.648
...could create such images.

01:13:10.731 --> 01:13:12.775
And you wish you thought of it.

01:13:13.234 --> 01:13:15.152
Don't be a sore loser.

01:13:15.403 --> 01:13:17.488
Step inside. Give it a try.

01:13:19.907 --> 01:13:23.578
If you can introduce images into the mind,
what stops you from...

01:13:23.744 --> 01:13:26.163
...extracting images out of the mind?

01:13:28.082 --> 01:13:30.668
Too timid to try my machine? Just say so.

01:13:34.171 --> 01:13:35.506
Shall we dance?

01:13:56.695 --> 01:13:58.405
Naughty, naughty.

01:13:59.281 --> 01:14:00.866
Looking for something?

01:14:01.033 --> 01:14:03.910
I was just wondering how you turn it off.

01:14:07.539 --> 01:14:08.624
Clever.

01:14:09.625 --> 01:14:10.626
Thanks.

01:14:10.792 --> 01:14:12.127
My pleasure.

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.159
Good evening, Mr. Wayne.

01:14:44.577 --> 01:14:45.787
Relax.

01:14:48.164 --> 01:14:49.749
Tell me your...

01:14:50.583 --> 01:14:51.918
...dreams.

01:14:53.586 --> 01:14:54.921
Tell me...

01:14:55.088 --> 01:14:56.839
...your fantasies.

01:14:58.508 --> 01:15:00.385
Tell me your secrets.

01:15:03.012 --> 01:15:04.347
Tell me...

01:15:05.515 --> 01:15:07.267
...your deepest...

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.851
...darkest...

01:15:09.186 --> 01:15:10.521
...fears.

01:15:41.218 --> 01:15:42.553
Relax, folks!

01:15:42.803 --> 01:15:45.889
It's only an old-fashioned, low-tech stickup!

01:15:46.223 --> 01:15:48.225
We're interested in the basics:

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:50.937
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.

01:15:51.896 --> 01:15:55.567
Hand them over nice and quietly,
and no one will be hurt!

01:16:00.572 --> 01:16:02.324
Emergency, Alfred.

01:16:03.074 --> 01:16:04.367
Yes, sir.

01:16:06.369 --> 01:16:08.079
Be calm, everybody!

01:16:08.246 --> 01:16:09.664
Just stay calm!

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:11.207
Excuse me!

01:16:14.586 --> 01:16:17.589
You're ruining my big party!
Are you insane?

01:16:18.381 --> 01:16:21.092
We're sick of waiting for you
to deliver Batman.

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:23.261
Patience, O Bifurcated One.

01:16:23.386 --> 01:16:25.513
Patience, hell! We want him dead!

01:16:25.597 --> 01:16:29.309
And nothing brings out the Batman
like a little murder and mayhem!

01:16:29.393 --> 01:16:31.938
You could have let me in on the caper.

01:16:32.104 --> 01:16:36.275
We could have organized it, planned it,
pre-sold the movie rights!

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:52.291
Your entrance was good, his was better.

01:17:00.633 --> 01:17:01.884
The difference?

01:17:01.968 --> 01:17:03.427
Showmanship!

01:17:10.978 --> 01:17:12.396
Emergency, Alfred.

01:17:12.521 --> 01:17:13.939
Oh, sir....

01:17:14.398 --> 01:17:16.400
I could be fired for this.

01:17:17.442 --> 01:17:20.362
Perhaps they'll have me back
at Buckingham Palace.

01:17:32.249 --> 01:17:34.501
All right, boys! Phase Two!

01:17:38.755 --> 01:17:40.549
My place, midnight.

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:54.959
Nothing like a bad case of gas!

01:19:27.826 --> 01:19:29.536
Why can't you just die?

01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:23.674
Hi.

01:20:30.599 --> 01:20:32.225
What were you doing?

01:20:32.392 --> 01:20:35.187
You got a real gratitude problem,
you know that?

01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:37.856
I need a name. Batboy? Knight Wing?

01:20:38.398 --> 01:20:40.567
What's a good sidekick name?

01:20:40.776 --> 01:20:42.861
"Dick Grayson, college student."

01:20:42.945 --> 01:20:44.071
Screw you!

01:20:44.237 --> 01:20:46.281
I saved your life. You owe me.

01:20:46.448 --> 01:20:48.700
You're going to get yourself killed.

01:20:48.909 --> 01:20:50.160
I'm your new partner.

01:20:50.243 --> 01:20:51.286
No!

01:20:51.912 --> 01:20:56.458
Whenever you go out at night, I'll be
watching. Where Batman goes, I'll go.

01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:58.502
How will you stop me?

01:20:59.169 --> 01:21:00.712
I can stop you.

01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:07.344
Hang this next to the Batsuit...

01:21:07.427 --> 01:21:08.971
...where it belongs.

01:21:13.476 --> 01:21:15.478
You're encouraging him.

01:21:16.646 --> 01:21:20.316
Young men with a mind for revenge
need little encouragement.

01:21:20.608 --> 01:21:22.318
They need guidance.

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:28.116
You, above all, should know
the consequences of the life you choose.

01:21:35.748 --> 01:21:38.501
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:42.130
Perhaps the lady is just
what the doctor ordered.

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:44.424
She seems lovely and wise.

01:21:45.216 --> 01:21:47.343
I've never been in love before.

01:21:48.219 --> 01:21:49.596
Go to her.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:52.808
Tell her how you feel.

01:21:53.017 --> 01:21:55.561
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

01:21:56.353 --> 01:21:57.688
Let her decide.

01:22:51.743 --> 01:22:53.078
I'm sorry.

01:22:55.205 --> 01:22:57.040
I can't believe this.

01:22:57.832 --> 01:23:01.044
I've imagined this moment
since I first saw you.

01:23:01.378 --> 01:23:02.837
Your eyes...

01:23:03.755 --> 01:23:05.257
...your lips...

01:23:06.758 --> 01:23:08.134
...your body.

01:23:10.303 --> 01:23:12.181
Now I have you and...

01:23:13.891 --> 01:23:16.560
...l'm wishing you were somebody else.

01:23:22.066 --> 01:23:24.735
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.

01:23:26.862 --> 01:23:28.572
I've met someone.

01:23:34.328 --> 01:23:35.705
He's not you.

01:23:38.124 --> 01:23:40.209
I hope you can understand.

01:23:45.548 --> 01:23:47.049
I understand.

01:23:52.139 --> 01:23:53.348
Well....

01:24:15.495 --> 01:24:17.497
That's just what I said.

01:24:18.248 --> 01:24:20.876
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:

01:24:21.668 --> 01:24:23.670
How to map the human mind.

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.549
Would you like to see
what Bruce Wayne has in his head?

01:24:41.397 --> 01:24:42.982
Riddle me this:

01:24:43.858 --> 01:24:45.610
What kind of man...

01:24:45.777 --> 01:24:47.862
...has bats on the brain?

01:24:51.616 --> 01:24:54.285
-Go ahead. You can say it.
-You're a genius.

01:24:54.452 --> 01:24:55.787
Oh, stop.

01:24:59.415 --> 01:25:01.417
So, from this day on...

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.795
...Batman is no more.

01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:07.715
You can't just quit.

01:25:07.882 --> 01:25:11.219
There's monsters out there.
Batman has to protect the innocent.

01:25:11.302 --> 01:25:14.890
I've dedicated my life to helping strangers
I've never met.

01:25:15.432 --> 01:25:17.351
Faces I've never seen.

01:25:17.726 --> 01:25:18.894
Well...

01:25:19.436 --> 01:25:21.939
...the innocent aren't faceless anymore.

01:25:22.815 --> 01:25:25.734
You can't tell me what to do
with the rest of my life.

01:25:25.818 --> 01:25:28.904
My dad told me that every man goes
his own way.

01:25:29.029 --> 01:25:31.073
My way goes to Two-Face.

01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:33.158
You must help me.

01:25:33.742 --> 01:25:35.744
And if you do find Harvey...

01:25:35.995 --> 01:25:37.496
...and then you kill him...

01:25:37.579 --> 01:25:38.831
...what next?

01:25:42.668 --> 01:25:43.752
Exactly.

01:25:44.503 --> 01:25:46.797
Then you'd be alone, like me.

01:25:49.758 --> 01:25:51.594
No, you must let this go.

01:25:52.053 --> 01:25:53.847
Listen to me, I'm your friend.

01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:56.516
I don't need a friend, I need a partner.

01:25:56.850 --> 01:25:58.685
Two-Face has got to pay.

01:26:00.186 --> 01:26:01.271
Please.

01:26:03.523 --> 01:26:06.985
Chase is coming for dinner.
I'm going to tell her...

01:26:07.944 --> 01:26:09.195
...everything.

01:26:11.489 --> 01:26:13.366
Come upstairs. We'll talk.

01:26:28.506 --> 01:26:30.425
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

01:26:31.384 --> 01:26:32.720
Happy Halloween.

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:34.639
Happy Halloween to you.

01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:13.512
I asked you here tonight because
there's something I wanted to tell you.

01:27:14.346 --> 01:27:16.682
I wanted to tell you something too.

01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:18.433
What I wanted--

01:27:19.559 --> 01:27:21.270
Go ahead, you first.

01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:27.734
Trick or treat!

01:27:29.695 --> 01:27:31.822
All my life I have been...

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:35.033
...attracted to a certain kind of man.

01:27:35.158 --> 01:27:36.451
The wrong kind.

01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:39.329
Look at what I do for a living.

01:27:42.582 --> 01:27:43.959
And since...

01:27:44.167 --> 01:27:46.211
...since I met you, I....

01:27:48.714 --> 01:27:50.007
Oh, God.

01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:52.302
Why am I so nervous?

01:28:00.184 --> 01:28:03.980
Don't eat too much tonight
or you'll be sick in your beds.

01:28:35.429 --> 01:28:37.097
Happy Halloween!

01:28:51.111 --> 01:28:52.529
What's wrong?

01:28:53.656 --> 01:28:55.074
It's happening again.

01:28:55.157 --> 01:28:56.450
Flashes.

01:28:57.159 --> 01:28:58.786
My parents' death.

01:28:59.954 --> 01:29:02.456
Your memories are trying
to break through.

01:29:02.539 --> 01:29:04.500
I want to tell you something.

01:29:04.625 --> 01:29:06.543
Something I've never told anyone.

01:29:06.627 --> 01:29:07.920
It's all right.

01:29:08.128 --> 01:29:09.922
It's all right. I'm here.

01:29:16.179 --> 01:29:17.514
I'm here.

01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:24.187
The night of my parents' wake...

01:29:24.896 --> 01:29:27.399
...the priest's words gave no comfort.

01:29:29.192 --> 01:29:30.568
Of course.

01:29:31.903 --> 01:29:33.989
There, on my father's desk...

01:29:34.155 --> 01:29:35.824
...the red book.

01:29:36.074 --> 01:29:37.534
Hisjournal.

01:29:37.909 --> 01:29:39.995
He'd written in it every day.

01:29:40.829 --> 01:29:43.206
But now he'd never write in it again.

01:29:44.416 --> 01:29:45.917
At that moment I knew...

01:29:46.001 --> 01:29:48.169
...my life would never be the same.

01:29:55.011 --> 01:29:57.305
I raced out into the storm...

01:29:57.930 --> 01:29:59.932
...trying to outrun the rage.

01:30:00.099 --> 01:30:01.267
The pain.

01:30:02.226 --> 01:30:03.686
Then I fell.

01:30:05.605 --> 01:30:07.189
I fell forever.

01:30:09.233 --> 01:30:11.235
The cave was monstrous.

01:30:12.528 --> 01:30:14.905
It must have been there for centuries.

01:30:17.033 --> 01:30:18.242
And there...

01:30:19.035 --> 01:30:20.786
...deep in the shadows...

01:30:22.246 --> 01:30:23.539
...l saw....

01:30:25.958 --> 01:30:28.002
It was coming toward me.

01:30:28.794 --> 01:30:31.631
I was scared at first, but only at first.

01:30:33.216 --> 01:30:35.886
The figure in the dark was my destiny.

01:30:37.137 --> 01:30:39.348
It would change my life forever.

01:30:41.558 --> 01:30:46.146
I would use its image to strike terror
into the hearts of those who did evil.

01:30:46.271 --> 01:30:50.692
I would ensure what happened to me
would never happen to anyone else.

01:30:51.818 --> 01:30:53.654
I would have my revenge.

01:30:57.491 --> 01:30:59.743
What are you trying to tell me?

01:31:02.162 --> 01:31:03.246
I'm....

01:31:38.116 --> 01:31:39.701
Twick or tweet!

01:31:46.874 --> 01:31:48.084
Trick.

01:31:55.217 --> 01:31:56.719
Remember the plan?

01:31:56.885 --> 01:31:58.637
Seize and capture.

01:31:59.346 --> 01:32:00.472
No killing.

01:32:00.556 --> 01:32:02.641
That goes double for you.

01:32:05.352 --> 01:32:07.354
If I was a superhero...

01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:10.149
...where would I hide?

01:32:15.112 --> 01:32:16.447
Spank me.

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:31.879
Intruder alert! lntruder alert!

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:37.093
Intruder alert! lntruder alert!

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:38.595
Shut up!

01:32:49.314 --> 01:32:51.316
Now, that's impressive!

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:11.002
It's always risky introducing
a tamed animal into the wild.

01:33:25.309 --> 01:33:28.980
They may have trouble adapting
to their new environment.

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:09.229
Somebody tell the fat lady...

01:34:09.396 --> 01:34:11.189
...she's on in five.

01:34:29.499 --> 01:34:30.792
"Joygasm! "

01:34:53.691 --> 01:34:55.193
Get the girl!

01:35:06.579 --> 01:35:08.164
Don't kill him.

01:35:10.124 --> 01:35:11.751
If you kill him...

01:35:20.594 --> 01:35:22.388
...he won't learn nothing.

01:35:57.799 --> 01:35:59.301
Master Bruce!

01:36:07.142 --> 01:36:08.977
How are you, young man?

01:36:10.353 --> 01:36:13.315
You haven't called me that for a long time.

01:36:13.607 --> 01:36:15.442
Old habits die hard.

01:36:16.318 --> 01:36:17.777
Are you all right?

01:36:18.528 --> 01:36:19.821
Where's Chase?

01:36:19.988 --> 01:36:22.157
I'm afraid they've taken her.

01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:24.534
Master Dick has run away.

01:36:25.201 --> 01:36:27.120
The cave has been destroyed.

01:36:28.079 --> 01:36:30.165
And there's another riddle.

01:36:41.093 --> 01:36:42.678
I'm coming, my sweet.

01:36:47.516 --> 01:36:48.893
Like the jacket?

01:36:49.226 --> 01:36:51.228
It keeps me safe when I'm...

01:36:51.395 --> 01:36:53.189
...jogging at night.

01:36:54.106 --> 01:36:55.816
Batman will come for me.

01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:58.361
Batman?

01:36:59.528 --> 01:37:01.197
Batman, you say?

01:37:02.406 --> 01:37:03.991
Coming for you?

01:37:07.411 --> 01:37:08.621
I'm...

01:37:09.246 --> 01:37:10.706
...counting on it.

01:37:15.712 --> 01:37:18.382
What is that? Where's it coming from?

01:37:19.591 --> 01:37:20.550
There!

01:37:20.884 --> 01:37:22.594
Who's doing that?

01:37:22.928 --> 01:37:24.388
The Riddler!

01:37:25.514 --> 01:37:28.600
"We're five little items of an everyday sort.

01:37:30.268 --> 01:37:32.854
"You'll find us all in a tennis court."

01:37:33.355 --> 01:37:34.439
In....

01:37:34.690 --> 01:37:36.066
A-E-l-O-U.

01:37:37.276 --> 01:37:38.277
Vowels.

01:37:38.443 --> 01:37:40.112
Not entirely unclever, sir.

01:37:40.195 --> 01:37:42.948
But what do a clock, a match,
chess pawns...

01:37:43.031 --> 01:37:46.451
...and vowels have in common?
What do these riddles mean?

01:37:46.618 --> 01:37:49.788
Every riddle contains a number
and they arrived in this order:

01:37:49.871 --> 01:37:51.290
13, 1, 8...

01:37:52.541 --> 01:37:53.458
...and 5.

01:37:53.542 --> 01:37:55.128
13, 1, 8 and 5.

01:37:56.462 --> 01:37:57.463
Meaning?

01:37:57.630 --> 01:37:59.340
Letters of the alphabet?

01:37:59.632 --> 01:38:01.426
Of course, 13 is M.

01:38:01.718 --> 01:38:04.721
1 would be A, 8 would be H
and 5 would be E.

01:38:05.388 --> 01:38:06.681
M-A-H-E.

01:38:08.224 --> 01:38:10.226
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.

01:38:11.561 --> 01:38:12.854
18 is R.

01:38:14.063 --> 01:38:15.189
M-R-E.

01:38:17.734 --> 01:38:18.901
How about...

01:38:18.985 --> 01:38:20.403
..."Mr. E"?

01:38:20.653 --> 01:38:22.822
-Mystery?
-Another name for mystery?

01:38:22.905 --> 01:38:23.906
Enigma.

01:38:24.407 --> 01:38:25.908
Mr. E. Nygma.

01:38:26.659 --> 01:38:27.994
Edward Nygma.

01:38:28.411 --> 01:38:32.415
Stickley's suicide was obviously
a computer-generated forgery.

01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:36.045
You really are quite bright,
despite what people say.

01:38:36.754 --> 01:38:38.797
Are all the Batsuits destroyed?

01:38:39.006 --> 01:38:43.802
All except the prototype with the sonar
modifications. But it's not tested.

01:38:44.678 --> 01:38:46.388
Tonight's a good night.

01:38:58.359 --> 01:39:00.736
What do you suggest? By sea...

01:39:02.363 --> 01:39:03.822
...or by air?

01:39:08.827 --> 01:39:10.037
Why not both?

01:39:19.047 --> 01:39:20.465
Who's your tailor?

01:39:20.548 --> 01:39:22.592
I took the liberty, sir.

01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:26.513
"R?"

01:39:26.805 --> 01:39:28.473
What's that stand for?

01:39:30.392 --> 01:39:31.393
Robin.

01:39:32.852 --> 01:39:35.730
Riddler and Two-Face can make
a pretty lethal combination.

01:39:35.814 --> 01:39:37.399
You could use a hand.

01:39:37.649 --> 01:39:39.734
Two against two are better odds.

01:39:40.318 --> 01:39:42.654
I can't promise I won't kill Harvey.

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:45.573
"A man's got to go his own way."

01:39:45.865 --> 01:39:47.575
A friend taught me that.

01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:49.995
Not just a friend.

01:39:52.497 --> 01:39:53.873
A partner.

01:40:27.116 --> 01:40:28.784
He's not coming.

01:40:29.368 --> 01:40:30.870
Shut it down.

01:40:41.131 --> 01:40:43.467
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

01:40:49.556 --> 01:40:50.849
Hey, go!

01:41:22.382 --> 01:41:23.549
A-14.

01:41:29.263 --> 01:41:30.014
Hit!

01:41:30.098 --> 01:41:31.057
Sweet!

01:41:31.891 --> 01:41:32.850
B-12.

01:41:36.854 --> 01:41:37.897
Hit!

01:41:38.398 --> 01:41:39.941
My favorite vitamin.

01:41:49.909 --> 01:41:51.786
That sinking feeling.

01:41:51.995 --> 01:41:53.329
I like this game.

01:41:53.413 --> 01:41:54.539
C-9.

01:42:05.467 --> 01:42:07.469
You sunk my battleship!

01:42:08.304 --> 01:42:09.596
Who, me?

01:42:34.246 --> 01:42:35.874
This is your captain speaking.

01:42:35.957 --> 01:42:40.045
Please return to your seats.
We will be experiencing turbulence.

01:42:47.844 --> 01:42:49.220
I got him!

01:42:56.061 --> 01:42:58.772
I hope they can find the little black box.

01:43:43.901 --> 01:43:45.111
Now...

01:43:47.113 --> 01:43:49.156
...the real game begins.

01:43:56.915 --> 01:43:58.709
Holy rusted metal, Batman!

01:44:00.752 --> 01:44:02.504
The ground, it's all metal.

01:44:02.587 --> 01:44:04.673
It's full of holes: holey.

01:44:10.012 --> 01:44:11.179
Wait!

01:44:13.432 --> 01:44:15.434
The whole island's moving!

01:45:01.564 --> 01:45:03.149
Looking for us?

01:45:07.987 --> 01:45:09.697
That was for my mother!

01:45:10.114 --> 01:45:11.240
My father!

01:45:14.118 --> 01:45:15.328
My brother!

01:45:16.497 --> 01:45:18.123
And this is for me!

01:45:49.738 --> 01:45:51.907
Finally, justice is served!

01:45:53.409 --> 01:45:54.827
Let us die!

01:46:03.628 --> 01:46:06.256
You're a man after our own heart, son!

01:46:06.548 --> 01:46:08.383
I'll see you in hell!

01:46:14.556 --> 01:46:16.391
I'd rather see you in jail!

01:46:20.729 --> 01:46:22.772
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

01:46:23.398 --> 01:46:25.108
The Bat's taught you well.

01:46:25.191 --> 01:46:26.276
Noble.

01:46:26.443 --> 01:46:27.777
Stupid...

01:46:28.403 --> 01:46:29.779
...but noble.

01:47:14.325 --> 01:47:15.910
Riddle me this.

01:47:16.452 --> 01:47:18.038
Riddle me that.

01:47:18.330 --> 01:47:20.874
Who's afraid of the big black bat?

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.710
No more tricks, Edward.

01:47:24.127 --> 01:47:25.712
Very well, then.

01:47:30.467 --> 01:47:32.010
Let's get real.

01:47:32.469 --> 01:47:34.888
Release Chase. This is between you
and me.

01:47:34.972 --> 01:47:36.056
And me...

01:47:36.181 --> 01:47:37.557
...and me!

01:47:40.644 --> 01:47:45.482
You've sucked Gotham's brain waves and
now you've devised a way to read minds.

01:47:47.734 --> 01:47:49.027
You betcha!

01:47:49.277 --> 01:47:53.407
Soon my little Box will be
on countless TV's around the world...

01:47:54.157 --> 01:47:56.743
...feeding me credit-card numbers...

01:47:56.868 --> 01:47:58.538
...bank codes...

01:47:58.746 --> 01:48:00.540
...sexual fantasies...

01:48:00.748 --> 01:48:02.834
...and little white lies.

01:48:03.501 --> 01:48:05.545
Into my head they'll go.

01:48:05.878 --> 01:48:07.797
Victory is inevitable.

01:48:08.673 --> 01:48:10.758
For if knowledge is power...

01:48:11.843 --> 01:48:13.511
...then a god...

01:48:13.678 --> 01:48:14.679
...am...

01:48:15.763 --> 01:48:16.889
...l!

01:48:23.521 --> 01:48:26.316
Was that over the top? I can never tell.

01:48:29.694 --> 01:48:32.530
By the way, I've seen your mind. Freak!

01:48:33.323 --> 01:48:35.283
Yours is the greatest riddle of all!

01:48:35.366 --> 01:48:38.495
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman
ever truly coexist?

01:48:39.872 --> 01:48:41.540
We'll find out today!

01:48:42.791 --> 01:48:45.544
But first, let's meet our contestants.

01:48:46.587 --> 01:48:48.297
Behind curtain...

01:48:49.214 --> 01:48:50.883
...number one...

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:57.222
...the absolutely fabulous
Dr. Chase Meridian!

01:48:58.557 --> 01:49:00.184
She enjoys hiking, manicures...

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:03.854
...and foolishly hopes to be the love
of Bruce's life.

01:49:09.818 --> 01:49:11.737
Behind curtain number two...

01:49:14.949 --> 01:49:17.284
..."Fatman's" one and only partner.

01:49:17.744 --> 01:49:19.704
This acrobat turned orphan...

01:49:19.829 --> 01:49:23.500
...likes Saturday-morning cartoons
and dreams of one day being...

01:49:23.625 --> 01:49:25.752
...bare-naked with a girl.

01:49:29.422 --> 01:49:31.633
And below these contestants...

01:49:31.841 --> 01:49:33.843
...my personal favorite:

01:49:34.094 --> 01:49:35.679
A watery grave.

01:49:38.306 --> 01:49:40.016
Just one little touch...

01:49:40.433 --> 01:49:43.603
...and five seconds later
these two players are...

01:49:43.853 --> 01:49:45.939
...gull feed on the rocks below.

01:49:48.858 --> 01:49:51.027
Not enough time to save them both.

01:49:54.990 --> 01:49:57.284
Which one will it be, Batman?

01:49:57.450 --> 01:49:58.786
Bruce's love?

01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:01.747
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?

01:50:04.667 --> 01:50:07.795
There is no way for me to save them
or myself.

01:50:08.421 --> 01:50:10.756
It's all one giant death-trap.

01:50:11.173 --> 01:50:12.341
Judges?

01:50:13.634 --> 01:50:16.387
I'm sorry. Your answer must be
in the form of a question.

01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:18.222
But thank you for playing.

01:50:18.306 --> 01:50:19.223
Wait!

01:50:20.683 --> 01:50:22.101
I have a riddle for you.

01:50:22.184 --> 01:50:23.352
For me?

01:50:25.187 --> 01:50:26.439
Really?

01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:30.943
Tell me.

01:50:34.655 --> 01:50:36.240
I see without seeing.

01:50:37.033 --> 01:50:39.911
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.

01:50:41.663 --> 01:50:42.789
What am l?

01:50:44.207 --> 01:50:45.459
Please!

01:50:46.168 --> 01:50:48.253
You're as blind as a bat!

01:50:49.046 --> 01:50:50.088
Exactly.

01:51:27.251 --> 01:51:28.503
Bummer!

01:52:33.027 --> 01:52:34.153
Thanks.

01:52:48.251 --> 01:52:50.170
All those heroics for nothing.

01:52:50.253 --> 01:52:53.048
No more riddles, no more curtains one
and two.

01:52:53.256 --> 01:52:55.050
Just plain curtains!

01:52:57.093 --> 01:52:59.179
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:52:59.346 --> 01:53:00.513
Your coin.

01:53:02.432 --> 01:53:04.267
You're always of two minds.

01:53:05.644 --> 01:53:07.646
Yes, of course. You're right.

01:53:08.271 --> 01:53:10.857
Emotion's always the enemy
of true justice.

01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:13.109
You've always been a good friend.

01:53:59.825 --> 01:54:00.951
Why?

01:54:02.119 --> 01:54:03.495
Why can't I...

01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:05.080
...kill you?

01:54:08.583 --> 01:54:10.377
Too many questions.

01:54:10.919 --> 01:54:12.504
Too many questions.

01:54:13.338 --> 01:54:14.631
Poor Edward.

01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:17.342
I had to save them both.

01:54:17.843 --> 01:54:20.595
You see, I'm both Bruce Wayne
and Batman.

01:54:21.346 --> 01:54:23.265
Not because I have to be.

01:54:23.432 --> 01:54:24.599
Now...

01:54:25.142 --> 01:54:27.144
...because I choose to be.

01:54:50.627 --> 01:54:54.881
Thank you for responding to my request
for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.

01:54:55.256 --> 01:54:56.507
Edward Nygma...

01:54:56.674 --> 01:55:00.511
...has been screaming for hours
that he knows the true identity...

01:55:00.678 --> 01:55:02.180
...of Batman.

01:55:15.943 --> 01:55:17.111
Edward?

01:55:17.945 --> 01:55:19.114
Who...

01:55:19.657 --> 01:55:20.991
...is it?

01:55:23.786 --> 01:55:25.913
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase.

01:55:27.498 --> 01:55:29.083
Do you remember me?

01:55:31.043 --> 01:55:32.753
How could I forget?

01:55:34.546 --> 01:55:36.465
Dr. Burton tells me...

01:55:37.633 --> 01:55:39.551
...you know who Batman is.

01:55:40.552 --> 01:55:43.555
I can't tell you if you don't say, "please."

01:55:44.974 --> 01:55:46.558
Edward, please.

01:55:46.767 --> 01:55:48.310
Who is Batman?

01:55:51.063 --> 01:55:52.272
I'm...

01:55:52.648 --> 01:55:54.024
...Batman.

01:56:20.343 --> 01:56:22.178
Your secret is safe.

01:56:22.345 --> 01:56:24.431
He is definitely a wacko.

01:56:25.682 --> 01:56:26.808
"Wacko?"

01:56:27.017 --> 01:56:28.768
Is that a technical term?

01:56:29.436 --> 01:56:30.520
Listen...

01:56:34.107 --> 01:56:36.276
...I won't need this anymore.

01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:42.408
Thank you for giving me a new dream.

01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:00.968
Don't work too late.

01:57:01.305 --> 01:57:07.234
