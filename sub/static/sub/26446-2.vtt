00:03.864 --> 00:05.932
Oh, hey, Miss Jenkins.
How you doing today?

00:05.933 --> 00:10.102
Oh, child, I got these
damn bunions on my feet.

00:10.103 --> 00:12.205
I got a pedicure yesterday

00:12.206 --> 00:15.041
and I know they were talking about me,

00:15.042 --> 00:19.078
so I'm gonna learn Japanese,
Chinese, Korean, something,

00:19.079 --> 00:21.514
find out what them bitches be saying.

00:23.016 --> 00:25.485
A-All right, Miss Jenkins,
you have a good day.

00:25.486 --> 00:30.089
Eh, eh. I wasn't through talking.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:45.706 --> 00:47.173
Hey.

00:47.174 --> 00:48.975
How my babies?

00:48.976 --> 00:51.143
Dad, why'd you send us a Cubs hat,

00:51.144 --> 00:52.979
20 juice boxes

00:52.980 --> 00:55.248
and 12 bow ties?

00:55.249 --> 00:57.517
Okay, look, look.

00:57.518 --> 01:01.454
Last night, I had a few... sodas,

01:01.455 --> 01:03.523
and, uh, I had a sugar rush, you know,

01:03.524 --> 01:05.358
and the-the sugar went to my head.

01:05.358 --> 01:07.426
I ended up ordering you guys
a bunch of stuff online and...

01:07.427 --> 01:09.629
How come you look so sad?

01:09.630 --> 01:11.097
Well, I...

01:11.098 --> 01:13.132
How come you look like
you haven't been sleeping?

01:13.133 --> 01:15.034
I mean, I've been trying
to get some sleep, but...

01:15.035 --> 01:16.502
Well, he looks like this
because since us

01:16.503 --> 01:18.137
and Mommy don't live with him anymore,

01:18.138 --> 01:20.374
he's gonna have to try
to rebuild his life

01:20.375 --> 01:23.709
and he's probably worried about
whether or not he even can.

01:23.710 --> 01:25.044
Right, Daddy?

01:26.547 --> 01:29.382
Is that why you look so bad, Daddy?

01:29.383 --> 01:30.883
- Look, look, look.
- It's okay, Daddy.

01:30.884 --> 01:32.552
I know you're sad.

01:32.553 --> 01:34.687
We can talk about this later
without Terry.

01:34.688 --> 01:35.988
I love you.

01:35.989 --> 01:38.224
Keep your head up.

01:38.225 --> 01:40.660
Bye, Daddy. Love you.

01:40.661 --> 01:42.895
Uh, I love you, too.

01:42.896 --> 01:45.398
And everything...

01:45.399 --> 01:47.733
everything's fine.

01:49.369 --> 01:51.604
Oh, no, it's not.

01:54.041 --> 01:57.310
Man, I got to stop
drunk-buying my kids gifts.

01:58.545 --> 01:59.845
Now, before we go,

01:59.846 --> 02:02.515
I just want to say always listen

02:02.516 --> 02:04.383
to that little voice in your head.

02:04.384 --> 02:06.485
I listen to that voice all the time,

02:06.486 --> 02:09.255
and look at me, I got
a talk show, a game show,

02:09.256 --> 02:11.557
and my wife sure is fine,
ain't she, y'all?

02:11.558 --> 02:12.858
Come on, y'all.

02:12.859 --> 02:14.694
Come on, put her on the screen.

02:14.695 --> 02:16.662
Mm-mm-mm.

02:18.599 --> 02:20.700
So go out there,
do something for yourself.

02:20.701 --> 02:22.268
Live your best life.

02:22.269 --> 02:25.538
And remember, you got to get
up before you sit down.

02:25.539 --> 02:26.906
Say it with me, y'all!

02:26.907 --> 02:30.109
You got to get up before you sit down.

02:30.110 --> 02:32.678
See you tomorrow
on The Clarence Hatch Show.

02:34.481 --> 02:36.449
Oh, that-that really peps
you up, when he says,

02:36.450 --> 02:39.251
"You got to get up
before you sit down."

02:39.252 --> 02:41.921
Sounds like a James Brown song.

02:41.922 --> 02:44.056
♪ You got to get up, ha, ha ♪

02:44.057 --> 02:46.092
♪ Before you sit down. ♪

02:53.300 --> 02:54.567
Rel.

02:56.236 --> 02:59.739
Rel.

02:59.740 --> 03:02.441
Rel.

03:02.442 --> 03:05.611
Girl, you almost got 409'd.

03:05.612 --> 03:07.480
Please tell me you're not wearing a

03:07.481 --> 03:09.148
bootleg outfit to brunch.

03:09.149 --> 03:11.083
You look like one of the kids
on the team

03:11.084 --> 03:12.585
who didn't sell all their candy bars.

03:14.621 --> 03:16.455
Look, look, I'm not wearing
this, okay?

03:16.456 --> 03:18.624
Look, I put all my clothes
in the wash before I realized

03:18.625 --> 03:21.293
- all I had left were my pajamas.
- You sleep in that?

03:21.294 --> 03:24.063
Yeah, I mean, you know,
guys don't wear real pajamas.

03:24.064 --> 03:26.499
You know, we wear the stuff
we won't wear outside.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.668
A fanny pack?

03:28.669 --> 03:31.337
This is not no ordinary fanny
pack, this is my wash belt.

03:31.338 --> 03:33.673
That's where I got my detergent,
uh, I got my fabric softener.

03:33.674 --> 03:36.676
Something you will never have to
carry in there, though: condoms.

03:38.111 --> 03:39.779
Look, okay, you can hate all you want,

03:39.780 --> 03:41.480
but you're not gonna kill
my vibe, all right?

03:41.481 --> 03:43.115
This brunch is the first thing
I've been able to do

03:43.116 --> 03:44.617
since Shannon left, you know?

03:44.618 --> 03:46.218
I'm starting over, I'm feeling good,

03:46.219 --> 03:47.720
because you know something?
You got to get up,

03:47.721 --> 03:50.589
- before you sit down.
- Before you sit down.

03:51.692 --> 03:53.459
- Oh, what's up, man?
- Hey.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.528
- Rel, I was shocked
- Hey, Pop.

03:55.529 --> 03:57.496
When you texted me about going
to this hip-hop jazz brunch.

03:57.497 --> 03:59.131
I thought you sit here
all day and just cry

03:59.132 --> 04:00.566
about your family being gone.

04:02.402 --> 04:04.970
I mean, Dad, if you know I-I'm
at home crying all the time,

04:04.971 --> 04:06.739
why you don't call or come visit me?

04:06.740 --> 04:08.574
You know I don't do tears, son.

04:08.575 --> 04:10.643
Look, I tried so hard to cry
when Obama won,

04:10.644 --> 04:12.078
only thing that happened was

04:12.079 --> 04:14.079
my eye started twitching instead, man.

04:15.615 --> 04:18.216
When Prince died, my eye
twitched for three days.

04:18.218 --> 04:20.920
My eye was...

04:22.956 --> 04:24.323
Listen, life threw me a curve ball,

04:24.324 --> 04:26.525
but right now I'm bouncing back.

04:26.526 --> 04:28.194
Bouncing back? Are you sure?

04:28.195 --> 04:29.829
'Cause this fake Bulls outfit

04:29.830 --> 04:32.498
is screaming "life just dumped
all over your ass."

04:33.900 --> 04:35.534
- Come on, man.
- Look, what kind of jersey

04:35.535 --> 04:37.970
- got a first name on it?
- Scottie!

04:37.971 --> 04:39.705
Look, I just think we deserve

04:39.706 --> 04:41.307
to do something for
ourselves, you know?

04:41.308 --> 04:42.875
We've been through a lot
the last year.

04:42.876 --> 04:45.745
You know, Mom passed away
and Nat did some time

04:45.746 --> 04:48.047
and Shannon left with the kids
and, you know, Brittany...

04:48.048 --> 04:51.751
Oh, I'm good. In fact, I'm killing it.

04:53.286 --> 04:55.921
But your pain is my pain, too.

04:57.958 --> 05:00.860
Wait a minute.

05:00.861 --> 05:02.128
Laundry is ready, y'all.

05:02.129 --> 05:04.630
That's right, I got a stopwatch.

05:04.631 --> 05:06.532
It's a key component of the wash belt.

05:06.533 --> 05:08.100
Be right back, guys.

05:11.838 --> 05:14.473
No, sorry, Rel,
but you can't go in there.

05:14.474 --> 05:15.908
Larry, what are you talking
about, "can't go in there"?

05:15.909 --> 05:17.176
My clothes are in the dryer.

05:17.177 --> 05:20.880
Oh, that sucks.

05:20.881 --> 05:23.349
The Lords are having
a meeting in there.

05:23.350 --> 05:27.186
Bruh, there's a gang having
a meeting in our laundry room?

05:27.187 --> 05:28.454
Yeah.

05:28.455 --> 05:29.889
Why did you let them in?

05:29.890 --> 05:31.792
What do you want me to do?

05:31.793 --> 05:35.294
For some reason, everybody in
this building thinks I'm Jet Li.

05:35.295 --> 05:37.396
You know something, Larry?

05:37.397 --> 05:38.798
I'm going in there.

05:38.799 --> 05:41.100
No, man, I can't let you do that.

05:41.101 --> 05:45.304
They said if anybody went in
there, it would be my ass.

05:45.305 --> 05:47.172
They're gonna take my ass.

05:53.903 --> 05:55.112
What's wrong Rel?

05:56.447 --> 05:58.548
So I couldn't get my clothes,

05:58.549 --> 06:00.984
and the reason is
is gonna sound insane.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.986
Uh...

06:02.987 --> 06:07.357
The Lords are having a meeting...

06:07.358 --> 06:09.659
in my laundry room.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.763
Hold up. There's a gang
in your laundry room? Why?

06:12.764 --> 06:14.998
Gentrification.

06:16.901 --> 06:20.871
Nat, that is literally
the opposite of gentrification.

06:20.872 --> 06:23.173
I thought when I moved in this
building full of old people,

06:23.174 --> 06:26.376
- I'd be safe.
- Rel, this is Chicago.

06:26.377 --> 06:29.146
You live in a bad neighborhood,
you're just in a nice building.

06:29.147 --> 06:30.480
What am I supposed to do, man,
you know?

06:30.481 --> 06:32.449
I can't call the police.

06:32.450 --> 06:35.319
I don't know if they're gonna
help me or lock me up, you know.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.488
And I come downstairs, they tell
me I fit the description,

06:38.489 --> 06:40.290
put me in a police car,
and I'm arguing, like, know.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.271
"Yeah, you think I'd call
the police on myself?"

06:43.494 --> 06:45.462
That actually happened
to my Uncle Bobby.

06:45.463 --> 06:47.097
He called 911, they came

06:47.098 --> 06:48.832
and arrested him
for having chest pains.

06:48.833 --> 06:52.569
Now that's what they call
cardiac arrest.

06:55.606 --> 06:56.840
See, that's sickening.

06:56.841 --> 06:58.176
All these gangs today

06:58.177 --> 07:00.143
shooting up everybody everywhere.

07:00.144 --> 07:01.978
Don't make no sense.
Holding the gun sideways.

07:01.979 --> 07:03.947
This ain't... that's not how
you shoot a gun.

07:03.948 --> 07:06.716
That's how you get carpal tunnel.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.318
Okay, Dad, what you mean,
"gangs today"?

07:08.319 --> 07:09.920
Gangs have always been like this.

07:09.921 --> 07:11.655
Oh, not The Dragons.

07:11.656 --> 07:13.557
Oh, Lord, no.

07:15.126 --> 07:17.494
I love the story about The Dragons.

07:17.495 --> 07:19.329
What are The Dragons, again?

07:19.330 --> 07:21.098
The Dragons was Dad's band.

07:21.099 --> 07:22.499
Oh, excusez-moi.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.169
We were a band and a gang: bangers.

07:26.170 --> 07:28.171
We was a good gang.

07:28.172 --> 07:31.675
We would, like, bully doctors
to give out free flu shots.

07:31.676 --> 07:33.810
You-you ever had to rumble with
a bunch of doctors?

07:33.811 --> 07:36.880
Get a stethoscope wrapped
around your neck.

07:36.881 --> 07:38.982
All right, look, yeah, look,
all this is crazy, man.

07:38.983 --> 07:40.183
Look, I'm just gonna go down there

07:40.184 --> 07:41.384
and get my clothes again myself.

07:41.385 --> 07:42.652
Oh, wait a minute, Rel.

07:42.653 --> 07:44.221
Rel, uh-uh, uh-uh.

07:44.222 --> 07:45.956
You know, whenever you try
to reason with people,

07:45.957 --> 07:47.824
you always wind up saying
something to make it worse.

07:47.825 --> 07:49.826
Besides, you can't beat a whole
gang, you ain't Jet Li.

07:49.827 --> 07:52.462
What is it with y'all
and Jet Li today?

07:52.463 --> 07:54.131
And what-what you gonna do?

07:54.132 --> 07:56.266
Look, I'm a bad bitch;
I get things done.

07:59.303 --> 08:01.238
Y'all wait up here,
I'm gonna go get his clothes,

08:01.239 --> 08:02.706
and we goin' to brunch.

08:06.043 --> 08:07.978
Oh, man, did you hear that?

08:07.979 --> 08:10.146
I wish she was my son.

08:15.219 --> 08:16.720
Hey, hey, you can't go in there.

08:16.721 --> 08:19.189
Look, Larry, I already know
it's a gang in there.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.291
Get one of them out here
to talk to me right now.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.893
Okay. All right.
Let me see what I can do.

08:22.894 --> 08:24.361
Hurry up.

08:24.362 --> 08:27.364
Hey, hey. There's somebody out here.

08:27.365 --> 08:29.232
Hey, oh.

08:29.233 --> 08:32.568
Little mama right here,
you hella decent.

08:32.570 --> 08:34.638
Got your hair done, nails done.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.173
Everything did.

08:38.075 --> 08:40.844
Mm, mm, look at that.

08:40.845 --> 08:42.879
And you slim-thick, too?

08:42.880 --> 08:44.614
What you got going on, though?

08:44.615 --> 08:45.916
Well, I'm a fashion designer.

08:45.917 --> 08:47.684
I actually made my own shirt.

08:47.685 --> 08:49.186
- What?
- Yeah.

08:49.187 --> 08:50.587
Oh, that's hella crazy.

08:50.588 --> 08:54.224
She's independent.

08:54.225 --> 08:55.959
Making shirts and everything,

08:55.960 --> 08:57.561
but-but where your store at, though?

08:57.562 --> 08:59.629
I have an online boutique
I'm working on.

08:59.630 --> 09:01.598
Oh, man, you scamming people,
that's crazy.

09:01.599 --> 09:05.068
- I don't scam nobody.
- N-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-no,

09:05.069 --> 09:07.070
no, no, little mama,
I don't mean it like that.

09:07.071 --> 09:10.040
I mean, I actually love
scamming, that's what I do.

09:10.041 --> 09:13.510
Matter of fact...

09:13.511 --> 09:15.078
you should be my baby mama.

09:15.079 --> 09:19.583
Boy, I could never ever
be your baby mama.

09:19.584 --> 09:22.619
You are literally one of the
dustiest dudes I've ever seen.

09:22.620 --> 09:24.421
Dusty?

09:24.422 --> 09:26.089
I ain't never dusty,
you know what I'm saying?

09:26.090 --> 09:28.625
I got this whole outfit
from Zara. What you mean?

09:28.626 --> 09:30.527
What kind of color scheme is that?

09:30.528 --> 09:32.462
Boy, you're wearing
three different blacks.

09:32.463 --> 09:34.864
You got glove black, light black,

09:34.865 --> 09:36.766
and ashy black. Boy, you dusty.

09:36.767 --> 09:39.603
Look, just please let me get
my friend's clothes

09:39.604 --> 09:41.805
and stop wasting my time,
because trust me,

09:41.806 --> 09:45.242
you could never have
a bad bitch like me.

09:45.243 --> 09:47.777
Oh, my God, here we go
with that "bad bitch..."

09:47.778 --> 09:49.512
"I'm a bad bitch, I'm a bad... "

09:49.513 --> 09:51.481
You know, s-some of you
are just okay bitches,

09:51.482 --> 09:52.816
you know what I'm saying?
Well, look, I'm gonna say this

09:52.817 --> 09:54.150
to you, like, you talking about

09:54.151 --> 09:55.252
you're a fashion designer, too.

09:55.253 --> 09:56.953
Come on, look at that shirt.

09:56.954 --> 09:59.789
You're like a princess
and a frog, like, put together.

09:59.790 --> 10:02.692
I'm only saying this to you,
I'm gonna keep it 100, though.

10:02.693 --> 10:04.294
You're old as hell.

10:05.529 --> 10:07.130
Probably pushing, like, 30,

10:07.131 --> 10:08.598
you know what I'm saying?

10:08.599 --> 10:13.169
Can I be real with you?

10:13.170 --> 10:15.705
If your dreams ain't came true now...

10:15.706 --> 10:18.408
...they ain't never coming true.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.610
And you got auntie hands.

10:28.185 --> 10:30.787
Am I too old to have dreams?

10:32.223 --> 10:33.957
G-Guys, don't answer that.

10:35.359 --> 10:37.027
What am I doing with my life?

10:37.028 --> 10:38.495
I want to be a fashion designer,

10:38.496 --> 10:40.263
but what steps have I really taken?

10:40.264 --> 10:41.898
And when Tupac was my age,

10:41.899 --> 10:45.268
he was already dead, man.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.504
And do I have auntie hands?

10:47.505 --> 10:49.739
- Rel, look at my hands. Look at them!
- Hey.

10:49.740 --> 10:51.541
What the heck is auntie hands?

10:51.542 --> 10:52.942
And did you get my clothes?

10:52.943 --> 10:55.145
Do I look like I got the clothes?

10:56.647 --> 10:58.882
You wear glasses. Do you see clothes?

10:58.883 --> 11:00.250
Ain't no clothes, Rel.

11:00.251 --> 11:01.785
There ain't gonna never be no clothes.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.653
Just like ain't no brunch
'cause brunch is over.

11:03.654 --> 11:05.155
Everything is over!

11:05.156 --> 11:06.890
Brunch is never over!

11:06.891 --> 11:09.859
I'm pretty sure they shut down
serving at 3:00 p.m.

11:09.860 --> 11:11.594
Okay.

11:11.595 --> 11:15.031
All right,
I can't let this sit no more.

11:15.032 --> 11:17.667
A Lord owes me a favor.

11:17.668 --> 11:20.170
What? Why you ain't
say nothing before?

11:20.171 --> 11:23.506
Why does a gang member
owe you a favor?

11:23.507 --> 11:26.710
Dad, the Lord that owes us
a favor is cousin Shawn.

11:26.711 --> 11:29.045
Wait, which cousin is Shawn?

11:29.046 --> 11:33.550
Oh, that's your cousin Arlene's
aunt's son's

11:33.551 --> 11:37.887
brother's uncle's son's sister's son.

11:37.888 --> 11:39.155
Look, just to reiterate, okay,

11:39.156 --> 11:40.890
this is a once in a lifetime favor.

11:40.891 --> 11:43.793
I can have anything I want.
Look, having a gang favor

11:43.794 --> 11:46.663
is like having a fairy godmother
with... with a pistol.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.998
Do...

11:48.999 --> 11:52.469
If you want me to waste
that once in a lifetime favor

11:52.470 --> 11:54.637
on your laundry...

11:54.638 --> 11:56.506
I mean, I...

11:56.507 --> 11:59.209
Hey. Make the call.

12:06.717 --> 12:08.918
Yo, Shawn, this is Nat, man.

12:10.955 --> 12:13.223
Yeah, I need to use that favor.

12:13.224 --> 12:16.226
Yeah, your boys is
in my brother's laundry room,

12:16.227 --> 12:18.228
and he just needs
to get his clothes out

12:18.229 --> 12:20.363
so we can go to brunch.

12:22.466 --> 12:25.368
Yes, this is that favor.

12:27.938 --> 12:30.340
Said it should probably be quick.

12:30.341 --> 12:32.442
Damn.

12:36.380 --> 12:39.315
Ha, ha! We got my clothes, yo.

12:39.316 --> 12:41.718
We are going to brunch. Yes!

12:41.719 --> 12:43.853
This day is not over with yet.

12:43.854 --> 12:47.056
Ooh.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.826
Damn, Rel, you're taking this
separation worse than I thought.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.531
Man, these ain't my clothes.
You got to call Shawn back.

12:54.532 --> 12:56.166
Call Shawn back? Did you know him?

12:56.167 --> 12:58.334
Yo, this a once-in-a-lifetime
favor. No do-overs.

12:58.335 --> 13:01.404
You know what? Damn it! I
thought I would just let you all

13:01.405 --> 13:03.306
fly and handle this by yourselves,

13:03.307 --> 13:06.509
but I guess y'all don't have
the wings of a... Dragon!

13:07.945 --> 13:10.447
Spread your wings, Daddy! Spread 'em!

13:10.448 --> 13:12.015
Go down there

13:12.016 --> 13:14.350
and give these Lords a dose
of that Dragon fire.

13:17.855 --> 13:20.790
Drag-on!

13:22.159 --> 13:24.260
Drag-ons!

13:25.663 --> 13:27.664
Dad, what happened?
Where is your shoe?

13:27.665 --> 13:29.065
Hey, don't worry about that.

13:29.066 --> 13:30.667
Lords didn't know what hit them.

13:30.668 --> 13:33.136
I got down there, Larry was
trying to hold the door.

13:33.137 --> 13:34.971
Boom! Kicked the door in like Jet Li.

13:34.972 --> 13:37.841
- God, not again.
- But this was my gout leg,

13:37.842 --> 13:40.610
so, my gout flared up.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.046
So I had to take my shoe off.
My leg was swollen up.

13:43.047 --> 13:44.881
Man came at me with a gun,
took my shoe.

13:44.882 --> 13:47.684
Bam! Hit him upside his face.

13:47.685 --> 13:49.565
Shoe went flying,
so I couldn't find my shoe.

13:49.566 --> 13:51.169
So I'm looking at them. I said,
"Brother you want some?"

13:51.170 --> 13:54.319
He said "no". Slapped him anyway.

13:54.525 --> 13:56.960
Now he crying.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.395
And the rest of the gang like,
"Why you make our boy cry?"

13:59.396 --> 14:00.797
So they all pull their guns out,

14:00.798 --> 14:02.198
but they're holding 'em sideways,

14:02.199 --> 14:04.667
so everybody gonna
get shot. I gots to go.

14:04.668 --> 14:07.070
Next you know,

14:07.071 --> 14:08.905
I'm on trial for homicide, 12 people.

14:08.906 --> 14:11.274
I can't do that time.

14:16.347 --> 14:18.448
Larry, what you doing here?

14:18.449 --> 14:21.251
Hey, Mister, you dropped
your shoe when you ran away.

14:21.252 --> 14:23.353
Nah...

14:23.354 --> 14:24.854
Hey, ran away?

14:24.855 --> 14:26.589
Yeah.

14:26.590 --> 14:30.126
He told The Lords they should
be giving away flu shots.

14:30.127 --> 14:34.163
Then he started making dragon
sounds and blowing in the air.

14:37.067 --> 14:39.035
Everybody started laughing, man.

14:39.036 --> 14:42.805
Dude ran away so fast
his shoe came off.

14:42.806 --> 14:45.808
Here you go, man.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.416
Look, this is crazy.

14:53.417 --> 14:56.519
Rel, you better put on
a long coat 'cause I'm starving.

14:57.655 --> 14:59.289
Man, what...?

14:59.290 --> 15:02.292
Rel, you got a suit right here!

15:02.293 --> 15:03.893
You good. We can still make brunch,

15:03.894 --> 15:05.795
and you can get your laundry
when we come back home.

15:05.796 --> 15:07.297
I can't wear my Sunday suit
on a Saturday.

15:07.298 --> 15:10.266
Don't make no sense.

15:10.267 --> 15:11.768
Rel, just put the damn suit on!

15:11.769 --> 15:15.772
Look, y'all,
it's the principle of it, okay?

15:15.773 --> 15:17.974
Y'all know how things have
been hard for me lately.

15:17.975 --> 15:20.443
I just needed today to go right.
I need something to go right!

15:20.444 --> 15:22.979
Then I was extra motivated.
I was watching Clarence Hatch.

15:22.980 --> 15:25.281
And he said somethin so profound.

15:25.282 --> 15:29.452
He said you got to get up to sit down.

15:29.453 --> 15:31.654
Nah, you got it all mixed up.

15:31.655 --> 15:33.823
You see, you got to sit down
before you get up.

15:33.824 --> 15:35.692
No, no, no. You got to get up
before you sit down.

15:35.693 --> 15:36.597
That's the...

15:36.598 --> 15:38.094
Yeah, but if you're
already sitting down...

15:38.095 --> 15:41.164
Can we just go eat?!

15:41.165 --> 15:43.299
Look, guys, honestly, I...

15:43.300 --> 15:45.034
I'm not going nowhere
without my clothes, okay?

15:45.035 --> 15:47.303
So, if you want to eat...

15:47.304 --> 15:48.938
go ahead, go eat then.

15:48.939 --> 15:50.740
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah, we going. Let's go.

15:53.510 --> 15:54.944
Well, that's the plan.

16:38.543 --> 16:40.378
Where you think you're going?

16:40.379 --> 16:44.348
Um... to brunch.

16:44.349 --> 16:47.718
See, the thing is,
you not going nowhere.

16:47.719 --> 16:50.655
Okay, look, if-if this about

16:50.656 --> 16:55.226
what I may have allegedly saw

16:55.227 --> 16:57.328
in the dryer, uh...

16:57.329 --> 16:58.562
I don't even know what that is.

16:58.563 --> 17:00.197
Oh, you know what that is.

17:00.198 --> 17:02.266
That's cocaine.

17:02.267 --> 17:04.035
That was really specific.

17:04.036 --> 17:05.736
Uh...

17:07.806 --> 17:09.839
Uh, okay, guys, look,

17:09.840 --> 17:12.510
let me level with y'all.

17:12.511 --> 17:14.145
Um, if I can be honest,

17:14.146 --> 17:16.280
you dudes pretty much ruined
my damn day.

17:16.281 --> 17:18.049
You know what I mean?

17:20.051 --> 17:22.553
My life hasn't been
exactly perfect, man.

17:22.554 --> 17:25.388
I mean, my wife left me, and
took the kids with her and...

17:25.390 --> 17:28.559
Man, ain't nobody trying
to hear your life story,

17:28.560 --> 17:31.028
especially with this bogus-ass
short set you got on.

17:31.029 --> 17:33.431
I ain't never win no spelling bee,

17:33.432 --> 17:35.066
but I swear 'fore God

17:35.067 --> 17:37.234
I ain't never seen "Bulls"
spelled with no "Z."

17:41.340 --> 17:42.840
Hey, buddy goofy as hell.

17:42.841 --> 17:44.942
You might as well go on
and get out of here

17:44.943 --> 17:46.544
and take your panties with you.

17:46.545 --> 17:48.612
That's why your wife left you,

17:48.613 --> 17:51.248
kids don't respect you.

17:51.249 --> 17:53.517
She tired of being with a bum.

17:53.518 --> 17:56.687
It's okay. They gonna have
a new daddy soon.

17:56.688 --> 17:59.957
Instead of your clown ass.

18:11.837 --> 18:13.938
Um...

18:13.939 --> 18:16.240
I mean, the crazy thing is,
you-you calling me a clown,

18:16.241 --> 18:17.708
and like, "Ooh,
they gonna have a new daddy,"

18:17.709 --> 18:19.243
and all at good stuff.

18:19.244 --> 18:21.712
But, like, only clown I see is, uh...

18:28.186 --> 18:30.554
...is standing right in front of me.

18:30.555 --> 18:32.790
Who you talking to, fat boy?

18:32.791 --> 18:34.258
You getting real tough.

18:34.259 --> 18:36.027
You see Lord and 'em over here?

18:36.028 --> 18:37.828
They'd kill for ManMan.

18:37.829 --> 18:39.295
I'm God on the West Side.

18:39.296 --> 18:41.608
Don't gamble with your
life for your pride

18:41.609 --> 18:44.010
especially not in this
bogus-ass outfit.

18:44.011 --> 18:45.911
You want to die in that?

18:45.912 --> 18:49.115
Look, I don't want to die
in my pajamas, that's true.

18:53.153 --> 18:56.208
I know who you is, brother.
I know your type.

18:56.209 --> 18:57.657
I know all y'all, right?

18:57.658 --> 18:58.924
You go around neighborhoods,

18:58.925 --> 19:00.760
terrorizing 'em, shooting 'em up.

19:00.761 --> 19:02.776
You know, not even shooting the
people you're supposed to kill.

19:02.777 --> 19:05.298
Your killing innocent people
Most of 'em are kids, yo.

19:05.299 --> 19:08.134
You hear me? Kids!

19:08.135 --> 19:10.202
You ever watch the news?

19:10.203 --> 19:12.571
Y'all be seeing those mothers
that's crying,

19:12.572 --> 19:14.507
thinking they're gonna see
their kid come home

19:14.508 --> 19:16.642
from school that day?

19:16.643 --> 19:18.077
But no, we got
some ignorant fools out here

19:18.078 --> 19:19.679
just shooting it up.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.914
That don't that make you want
to stop, man?

19:21.915 --> 19:24.050
Look, bullets ain't got
no names, you hear me?

19:24.051 --> 19:26.986
I ain't choose this life.
This life chose me.

19:26.987 --> 19:29.822
At the end of the day,
I'm trying to survive.

19:29.823 --> 19:32.058
If you get smoked, you get smoked.

19:32.059 --> 19:34.093
Better your life than mine.

19:34.094 --> 19:37.330
This is Chicago, okay?
This is not Chiraq.

19:37.331 --> 19:39.365
Do y'all like that they call
Chicago "Chiraq"?

19:39.366 --> 19:41.767
- That's cool with you?
- That's where we at, boy.

19:41.768 --> 19:43.302
No, that's not where we at.

19:43.303 --> 19:44.870
You got regular citizens

19:44.871 --> 19:46.872
that live here,
that work hard every day,

19:46.873 --> 19:48.874
and they should be able
to come home safe

19:48.875 --> 19:50.943
and their kids should be able
to come home safe

19:50.944 --> 19:53.112
and not deal with this.

19:53.113 --> 19:56.148
Look, man, I don't want to see
nothing happen to none of y'all,

19:56.149 --> 20:00.052
but this mindset we got...
I'm just tired of it.

20:00.053 --> 20:03.789
And it hurts, man.

20:03.790 --> 20:08.594
All right, all right,
I've called the police.

20:08.595 --> 20:11.964
Y'all need a hearing aid?

20:11.965 --> 20:13.966
I said I called the police.

20:13.967 --> 20:17.036
They're on the way, so y'all get
the hell up out of here!

20:17.037 --> 20:20.673
And I'm in 4B.
Come and see me if you dare.

20:20.674 --> 20:22.508
I ain't scared of y'all.

20:22.509 --> 20:25.945
I got breast cancer, all right?

20:25.946 --> 20:28.247
Look, I'm gonna see you around, man.

20:30.817 --> 20:32.852
Damn, Rel.

20:32.853 --> 20:35.488
That was inspiring, man.

20:35.489 --> 20:37.477
Man, you told 'em
exactly what they need...

20:37.478 --> 20:41.894
Okay. Larry, bruh, I... I swear to you

20:41.895 --> 20:44.930
I'm gonna get you fired.

20:45.866 --> 20:48.033
Hold up.

20:48.034 --> 20:50.569
Where the hell are my panties?

20:56.005 --> 20:58.424
Make sure you grab a copy
of my new book,

20:58.425 --> 21:01.427
You Gotta Get Up To Sit Down,
Part Two:

21:01.428 --> 21:04.196
How to Get a Wife As Fine As Mine.

21:04.197 --> 21:06.832
Okay, y'all, that'll wrap
our show up for today.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.201
And see you tomorrow
