WEBVTT

00:58.559 --> 01:00.551
Melinda?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.636
This is your last chance.

01:06.692 --> 01:09.059
Do not fuck with me!

01:36.263 --> 01:38.220
Melinda!

01:46.815 --> 01:48.334
Many times,
we limit ourselves,

01:48.358 --> 01:50.896
when we think about
what we deserve.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.648
We forget what we want.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.071
Our imagination has been
traumatised, and we are...

01:55.157 --> 01:58.616
lies beyond what others
have laid out for us...

01:58.702 --> 02:00.614
we become reactionary...

02:49.836 --> 02:52.078
Excuse me, Sir.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.879
I'm sorry, but it's
against the rules

02:53.965 --> 02:55.957
to smoke near a pump.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.587
What do want me to do?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.010
I just lit this.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.212
I know.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.968
And I have nothing against
smoking, I smoke too.

03:03.058 --> 03:06.142
It's okay to have one
over there by my van,

03:06.228 --> 03:07.685
if you want me to show you.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.934
Nah, I'm almost done here.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.534
It's just really dangerous
to smoke by the pumps.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.315
The whole gas station
can light on fire.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.276
Hey, I'm not a fucking
idiot, alright?

03:23.370 --> 03:24.702
What do you think?

03:24.788 --> 03:26.950
I take this and
stick it in the pump?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.248
I wasn't trying
to be mean to you.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.451
You don't need to yell at me.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.462
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.946
Diane left again without
cleaning the bathrooms,

03:39.970 --> 03:41.336
or restocking.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.968
That's okay, I'll do it.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.578
The pistachios are
really amazing.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.494
My bad.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.579
They're my favorite
nut in the store.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.793
Cool.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.844
If you don't like them,
I'll give you a refund.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.803
Okay.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.097
My name is Melinda
by the way.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.438
Thanks.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.411
Whoa! Jesus! Is this
the ladies room?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.337
No, you're in
the right place.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.585
This is the men's.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.630
I was just cleaning
the bathroom.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.053
Oh, you can go
ahead and use it.

05:54.563 --> 05:55.706
You know you really
ought to put a

05:55.730 --> 05:57.972
sign if you're going
to be in here.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.838
Is the coffee ready?

06:22.924 --> 06:25.962
Yes. Here you go.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.490
How do these
skanks do this?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.122
Do what?

06:56.207 --> 06:58.699
Here, watch my ass.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.375
Do you see it?

07:03.465 --> 07:05.422
I think so.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.446
Now try flexing your ass
cheeks one at a time.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.774
- What?
- Just try it.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.951
Okay, go left, yeah right.

07:34.037 --> 07:37.075
Left, right, left.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.576
Right, yes, left.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.533
Right.
Keep going.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.163
I think you're doing it right.

07:42.253 --> 07:45.417
Yeah, left, right.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.089
Left.
Left.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.633
- Wait, you were filming me?
- Keep going, keep going.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.427
- Sheila.
- People need to see this.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.551
What do you mean people?

07:54.641 --> 07:56.132
What, people coming
into the store?

07:56.226 --> 07:58.218
What? No!

07:58.311 --> 07:59.747
Sheila, can you please
can you delete that?

07:59.771 --> 08:01.374
What are you doing?
What do you care?

08:01.398 --> 08:02.398
No one knows who you are.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.483
Please can you delete it?

08:06.569 --> 08:08.231
Oh God.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.688
You take this one okay?
Uh what are you doing, freak?

08:10.782 --> 08:12.009
I don't want anyone to see that.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.366
Alright, I'll delete it.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.244
Hi, there.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.787
Hi.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.286
Hey, there.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.326
How can I help you?

08:23.420 --> 08:26.128
Um, what's her name?

08:26.214 --> 08:27.500
Sheila.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.797
Sheila, right.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.670
Hi, Sheila.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.967
Uh, I was in here
a few nights ago.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.090
Do you remember?

08:34.179 --> 08:34.966
It's Fred.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.844
No, I see a lot of
faces in here.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.472
Hi, Fred, my name is Melinda.

08:40.562 --> 08:43.429
Um, we were talking, and you
were telling me how your feet

08:43.523 --> 08:47.938
hurt so much from standing
all night and so um, uh,

08:48.028 --> 08:52.318
I thought um these might help.

08:52.407 --> 08:56.947
They're padded insoles
for your shoes.

08:57.037 --> 09:01.156
I'm guessing you're a size nine?

09:01.249 --> 09:04.117
Here you should,
uh, try them on.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.337
Wow, these look
really comfortable.

09:09.424 --> 09:12.337
She's right, after a long
shift we all have aching feet.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.137
I'm not a size nine.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.636
Oh, well that's okay because
you can cut these down

09:19.726 --> 09:20.637
if they're too big.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.138
Okay, okay, stop stop stop stop!

09:22.228 --> 09:23.719
You could get plantar
fasciitis or...

09:23.813 --> 09:24.929
Just stop, stop.

09:25.023 --> 09:28.187
I don't want your
foot pads okay?

09:28.276 --> 09:29.336
I don't want anything from you.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.191
Well, they're um.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.464
Sheila, I think he's
just being nice.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.275
I don't care how nice he
thinks he's being,

09:33.364 --> 09:35.321
he comes in here
every night.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.149
We're not going to have
some sort of thing

09:37.243 --> 09:38.825
happening between us, okay?

09:38.912 --> 09:39.912
You understand?

09:39.954 --> 09:44.574
Excuse me. Is there
another register open?

09:44.667 --> 09:46.704
Um...

09:48.588 --> 09:49.829
Fred, your insoles.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.336
I swear to God, he's
pathetic Melinda.

09:54.469 --> 09:57.337
Can I get two of the
Lucky Seven scratchers,

09:57.430 --> 10:00.264
and two of the Platinum Payoffs.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.437
The insoles fit my
shoes perfectly.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.734
What?

10:11.820 --> 10:14.358
It's like Cinderella.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.688
The shoe fits.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.949
Your insoles
fit my shoes.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.303
Hi there.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.382
Let me know if you need
help with anything.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.717
My name is Melinda, I work here.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.853
Hi, Melinda.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.272
Um, that's very kind of you.

10:50.358 --> 10:53.522
Is everyone else who works
here as nice as you are?

10:53.611 --> 10:55.398
Not really.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.070
Sheila over there
can be quite mean,

10:57.157 --> 11:00.776
but that's because
everyone talks to her.

11:00.869 --> 11:01.780
I understand.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.032
She's very pretty.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.158
Okay.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.615
Um...

11:07.709 --> 11:08.894
Maybe you could help me
out by telling me

11:08.918 --> 11:09.954
where the cigarettes are?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.080
Oh, that's easy.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.771
The cigarettes are
always by the counter.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.419
Great.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.739
Don't you just wish people
picked up after themselves?

11:44.829 --> 11:48.914
I guess that means you
wouldn't have a job then.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.161
How are you, Melinda?

11:50.251 --> 11:51.583
Everything good tonight?

11:51.669 --> 11:52.910
Yeah, everything's good.

11:55.924 --> 11:56.924
Is that your new car?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.593
Yes, it is.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.716
It's my first night going solo.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.593
Does that make you nervous?

12:05.683 --> 12:08.346
No. I've been training for
this for a long time.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.679
Feels great being by myself.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.265
Looks powerful.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.063
Do you need help?

12:19.447 --> 12:20.563
No.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.195
Zero to sixty in 5.3 seconds.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.276
Wow.

12:25.370 --> 12:29.080
The back of it kind of look
like a robot with sunglasses.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.908
No, I'm uh just
looking for condoms.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.412
Really?

12:33.503 --> 12:34.688
You've been looking
for like five minutes.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.669
Do you need me to
assist you with that?

12:36.756 --> 12:39.965
I can't imagine how you could.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.635
Are the windows bullet proof?

12:43.721 --> 12:45.587
Like if bad guys
were shooting at you,

12:45.682 --> 12:47.765
would the bullets
just bounce off?

12:47.850 --> 12:51.764
No, they'd hit me.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.220
I can take my break right now.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.773
Can you take me for a ride?

13:04.742 --> 13:06.358
Here, these should work.

13:07.662 --> 13:08.527
Yeah.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.409
I'll ring you up at the counter.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.037
This is amazing;
it's like an office.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.370
Yeah, it is.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.546
This is one of the newer models.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.712
What about the parking lot?

13:20.758 --> 13:23.216
Could we just go
around the parking lot?

13:23.303 --> 13:27.593
I wish I could, but I really
need to stay on schedule.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.702
Maybe I could get arrested and
then you could take me on a ride

13:29.726 --> 13:32.218
and do your job.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.143
What if I took this?

13:33.229 --> 13:37.143
No!

13:37.233 --> 13:40.601
I'm sorry.

13:40.695 --> 13:44.905
I'll take you on a
ride later, I promise.

13:44.991 --> 13:49.076
I'm going to go get a
coffee, stay on schedule.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.994
Okay.

13:53.875 --> 13:54.991
Hi, Sheila.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.620
Hi, Officer Liu.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.668
That's $9.45

14:01.007 --> 14:02.373
Hey, you know what?

14:02.467 --> 14:04.504
Uh, keep the change.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.335
You sure?

14:06.429 --> 14:09.217
I believe in karma.

14:09.307 --> 14:10.764
Is there a bathroom I could use?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.342
Yeah, right around the corner.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.972
Alright.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.524
How's everything tonight?

14:24.614 --> 14:25.814
I'm ready to go home.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.903
But I can't because Perry's
being an asshole right now.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.531
He just does not care that
he's late everywhere he goes.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.613
I'm sorry to hear that.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.164
This cracks me up.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.786
Fast action, extra
stimulating sex enhancements.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.293
100% guaranteed.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.625
It's always about sex
with you boys, isn't it?

14:46.260 --> 14:48.217
Oh, I... no I don't.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.045
No, it's not, it's not me.

14:50.139 --> 14:54.053
Oh, I see, you've
never had that problem.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.307
No, no.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.434
Melinda, what the
hell are you doing?

14:59.524 --> 15:02.733
Were you just taking
pictures of us?

15:02.819 --> 15:03.935
I wasn't.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.314
Officer Liu is a police officer.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.566
I wasn't.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.863
That's so inappropriate.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.156
Sheila, Sheila, it's okay.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.403
Relax.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.829
Is your phone alright Melinda?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.532
Melinda,
show us your phone.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.327
Oh, that's not good.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.965
I broke my screen as well.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.406
Attention all units,
we have a 503 in progress.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.672
Suspect white male
believed to be armed,

15:32.765 --> 15:36.600
last seen in grey sedan
driving south on 93.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.973
Well that's me.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.601
Sorry about your phone, Melinda.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.023
I've got to run.

15:45.653 --> 15:50.068
You are so creepy.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.405
Who else do you take pictures
of when they're not looking?

15:53.494 --> 15:56.328
Do you take pictures of me?

15:56.414 --> 15:58.576
Give me your phone,
Melinda, or I'll report you,

15:58.666 --> 16:01.283
and you'll lose your job.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.710
Show me your phone!

16:03.796 --> 16:06.413
I wasn't taking pictures of you.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.464
Oh, just Officer Liu?

16:08.551 --> 16:11.259
That's fucking creepy, he
probably think you're so weird.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.382
I would.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.964
Oh!

16:15.057 --> 16:19.097
Oh my God, you have an
entire album for him?

16:19.187 --> 16:20.928
What do you do?

16:21.022 --> 16:24.606
Do you go home and rub yourself
looking at pictures of him?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.399
Officer Liu?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.570
Don't tell me you're some
kind of weird virgin.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.318
Stop it, Sheila.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.866
Oh my God, are you
holding out or something?

16:36.204 --> 16:37.473
Cause I'm sure one of these
truckers out here would bang you

16:37.497 --> 16:39.580
in the bathroom if
you asked them to.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.533
I can probably set
something up for you.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.459
You're such a bitch.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.913
Uh, did you just hit me?

17:09.987 --> 17:11.979
Hey, Melinda.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.440
Don't be afraid, okay?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.011
I was just in the middle of
explaining to your friend

17:16.035 --> 17:19.574
Sheila here, that I'm
not here to hurt anybody.

17:19.664 --> 17:24.204
That's not why I'm here, but
I do need your cooperation.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.000
Can you follow some
simple instructions?

17:26.087 --> 17:28.955
Yes? Great.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.526
Would you mind going over
there and standing next

17:30.550 --> 17:31.791
to your friend Sheila?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.591
She's not my friend.

17:33.678 --> 17:38.298
Okay, regardless,
get over there.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.306
Where the hell were you?

17:44.397 --> 17:46.013
I'm not even
supposed to be here.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.643
Hey.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.020
Okay, now listen.

17:50.111 --> 17:51.818
No one is going to
be getting hurt.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.442
Alright? I am not
some evil criminal.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.239
Do I look like some
evil criminal Melinda?

17:58.244 --> 17:59.485
No. Great.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.663
I'm just in a little bit of
trouble and I know it's not your

18:02.748 --> 18:05.957
guy's fault, however, I will
be needing your cooperation.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.375
When this is all said and done,

18:07.461 --> 18:10.249
you're going to have one
hell of a story to tell.

18:10.339 --> 18:14.003
There are some very unreasonable
people who are trying to kill me

18:14.093 --> 18:17.211
and it wasn't even
my fucking fault.

18:17.305 --> 18:20.924
I did lose my temper, but
anyways I'm sure that you ladies

18:21.017 --> 18:24.931
wouldn't want a face like this
going to waste on a dead man.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.182
Right Melinda?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.104
Can you hurry up?

18:28.190 --> 18:30.150
You're robbing us, right?
That's what's happening?

18:32.403 --> 18:35.817
You need to calm
the fuck down.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.023
Okay, now.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.235
Neither of you two ladies own
this gas station, correct?

18:41.329 --> 18:45.573
- No.
- No.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.747
That's great news.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.270
That's great news
because you know why?

18:48.294 --> 18:49.876
This is not personal.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.545
Okay, I'm not robbing you
guys, it's not your money.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.498
Everything inside,
both the registers

18:54.592 --> 18:56.174
and everything in the safe.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.094
Well, we don't have
the keys to the safe.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.547
Only the managers do.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.724
Fuck.

19:03.809 --> 19:08.270
Okay, just give me
everything in the registers.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.688
It's less than a
hundred dollars.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.517
People don't really
pay with cash anymore.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.522
Well, except you.

19:16.030 --> 19:19.148
Here you want your change back?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.324
You're really being
a buzz kill, Sheila.

19:21.410 --> 19:25.279
Well, you're the genius
trying to rob a gas station.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.909
Is that thing even real?

19:28.626 --> 19:29.626
Fucking asshole.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.952
Shut the fuck up! Okay?

19:32.046 --> 19:33.273
Melinda could you please
tell you friend here

19:33.297 --> 19:34.879
to quit being so
fucking difficult?

19:34.965 --> 19:37.332
She's not my friend.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.588
Sheila, stop being
so fucking difficult.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.465
Hey, fuck you.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.261
Okay, that's
enough, alright here.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.216
Thank you, money, bag, let's go.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.723
What are you going
to do with the money?

19:50.856 --> 19:57.148
I am going to go pay off my debt
to these fucking stupid bikers.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.779
Is this going to be enough?

19:59.865 --> 20:03.529
No, apparently not.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.327
There's more money in the
safe, I can get it for you.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.724
You're going to
help this asshole?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.364
Sheila, he has a gun.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.370
I have a gun.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.668
I'll go get it.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.747
How much do you need?

20:16.841 --> 20:18.628
All of it.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.711
Okay.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.538
Shouldn't you be wearing
a mask or something?

20:42.783 --> 20:43.783
Uh oh.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.322
Don't you fuck around, okay?

20:50.416 --> 20:51.643
I need this money,
if I don't get it,

20:51.667 --> 20:52.947
I'll kill everybody
in this store

20:53.002 --> 20:56.086
I don't give a shit,
you understand? Hey!

20:56.172 --> 20:57.172
Yes, okay.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.750
Got it.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.952
- Evening.
- Hi.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.716
That's $12.45.

22:00.736 --> 22:04.104
Oh, we actually don't
have any change right now.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.656
You don't have any
change for a twenty?

22:06.742 --> 22:10.361
We just counted the register
with a new shift person.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.070
Can you ring me over here?

22:12.164 --> 22:15.157
That register's not
open right now.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.691
Sorry, it's a really
weird situation.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.045
Credit card?
Is that good?

22:21.131 --> 22:23.339
- Yeah.
- Alright.

22:23.425 --> 22:24.945
Do you know how to get
to Wrightwood from here?

22:24.969 --> 22:26.631
There's no service.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.585
It's a few miles, right?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.740
Yeah, it's just a
few miles down.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.255
Hop on Eighteen, right?

22:30.349 --> 22:31.349
Only a few miles?

22:31.392 --> 22:35.887
Yeah, you just, okay,
so you go down.

22:39.984 --> 22:43.352
It's just a couple
of miles down here.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.364
Where were you trying to go?

22:51.453 --> 22:52.318
Wrightwood.

22:52.413 --> 22:53.654
Oh, Wrightwood is simple,

22:53.747 --> 22:55.559
just get on the Eighteen East
and you'll be there

22:55.583 --> 22:56.994
in about twelve miles.

22:57.084 --> 22:57.949
You can't miss it.

22:58.043 --> 22:58.954
Alright.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.378
Thank you.
Come on, let's go!

23:09.471 --> 23:10.928
What was that?

23:11.015 --> 23:12.881
I have the money
all ready to go.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.967
Ah... Thank you.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.053
Melinda, you're an angel, thank
you for making this so easy.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.310
Can I have the backpack?

23:25.404 --> 23:28.442
Where are you headed
to after this?

23:28.532 --> 23:30.114
I'm going to go
pay off my debt,

23:30.200 --> 23:32.908
and then get the hell out of
wherever the hell this is.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.327
Can I go with you?

23:35.664 --> 23:36.575
What?

23:36.665 --> 23:38.201
Can you take me with you?

23:38.292 --> 23:39.749
Please.

23:39.835 --> 23:40.996
Are you out of your mind?

23:41.086 --> 23:43.544
Melinda, come on.

23:43.631 --> 23:44.838
You know what?
You should go.

23:44.924 --> 23:45.835
- No, no, look?
- You two belong together.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.962
Come on, come on, Melinda.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.714
Are you being serious?

23:49.803 --> 23:52.511
Yes.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.760
Melinda, just give me
the backpack, please.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.933
Take me with you.
I'd like to go with you.

23:57.019 --> 23:59.853
No, that's, that's not
going to happen, okay?

23:59.939 --> 24:02.477
Give me the fucking backpack.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.899
You don't want to
get involved in this.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.772
I do want to get involved.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.854
I can be useful.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.656
Melinda, I have no
use for you, okay?

24:11.742 --> 24:14.701
Give me the fucking money.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.995
You do have use for me.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.743
I just go you the
money from the safe,

24:18.832 --> 24:20.268
you wouldn't have
gotten that without me.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.705
Yes, and I appreciate
that, but Melinda,

24:22.795 --> 24:24.314
I don't have time for this
give me the fucking backpack.

24:24.338 --> 24:25.482
- Just give him the backpack.
- Stop.

24:25.506 --> 24:26.608
Melinda, give him
the fucking backpack.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.123
Give me the God damned backpack.

24:28.217 --> 24:29.924
Melinda, give it to me, fuck!

24:35.641 --> 24:38.304
God, you are such
a little bitch.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.228
Yeah you're just a
little bitch with a gun

24:42.314 --> 24:45.478
bullying two girls.
You call yourself a man?

24:45.567 --> 24:47.604
When did I ever say
that I was a man?

24:47.695 --> 24:48.735
Oh good!
'Cause you're not.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.466
You know what your
fucking problem is?

24:51.490 --> 24:52.634
You don't know when
to shut the fuck up.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.802
Oh yeah, you think
I'm scared of you?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.011
- You shut your fucking mouth.
- You're not tough.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.096
- Shut your...
- I-I'm not trying to be tough.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.305
I was nice to you.
I didn't hurt you.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.974
What are you going to do?
Are you going to shoot me?

24:58.998 --> 25:00.350
Why are you being so
fucking difficult?

25:00.374 --> 25:01.977
You know what, you're lucky my
boyfriend isn't here right now.

25:02.001 --> 25:02.912
Oh, wow, am I?

25:03.002 --> 25:03.867
The fucking boyfriend.

25:03.961 --> 25:04.747
Yeah, yeah, he's got guns too.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.272
Definitely has a
bigger dick than you.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.108
Why the fuck are we talking
about your boyfriend's dick?

25:08.132 --> 25:09.043
You're not tough.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.402
You want to see tough?
I can show...

25:10.426 --> 25:14.045
Take your money and get the fuck
out of here like a little bitch.

25:15.097 --> 25:17.555
Ow!

25:17.641 --> 25:19.132
I fucking told you, I told you.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.592
You made this happen.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.474
I was trying to be nice and
you wouldn't shut the fuck up.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.146
Melinda, lock the door.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.440
Lock the fucking door, Melinda.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.073
You need to learn how to
fucking talk to people.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.486
I would have been out of here,

25:31.572 --> 25:33.412
if you would have shut your
dumb fucking mouth.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.776
Give me your phone Melinda. Shh!

25:37.953 --> 25:40.070
Go into the bathroom 'til
I tell you to come out!

25:41.623 --> 25:42.704
You know what?

25:42.791 --> 25:44.227
I'm going to fucking teach
you how to talk to people.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.914
Get up! Get the
fuck up! Get up.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.092
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!

26:06.648 --> 26:08.810
Get the fuck off me!
Aaagh!

26:10.694 --> 26:13.983
Don't you fucking tempt
me! Don't you fucking tempt me!

26:15.115 --> 26:17.732
Whooh! Get 'em down.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.302
Now fuck you!

27:18.345 --> 27:19.656
Get the fuck off me
you fucking...

27:19.680 --> 27:21.296
- Dumbass.
- Fuck you!

27:21.390 --> 27:23.230
I told you to wait in the
fucking bathroom. Ow!

28:31.210 --> 28:33.873
Melinda, you stupid,
stupid idiot.

28:33.962 --> 28:37.046
Ah, Ah, Ah!

28:43.430 --> 28:44.637
Fuck.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.644
I wasn't going to shoot her.

29:03.367 --> 29:07.202
You can clean up all you fucking
want but it's your fault.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.162
Why are you cleaning it up?

29:20.550 --> 29:24.794
Huh? What, are you going to tell
some bullshit story to the cops

29:24.888 --> 29:26.971
when they get here?

29:37.442 --> 29:39.900
I wasn't going to shoot her.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.819
I'm not a murderer.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.054
Alright, what...
What are you going to tell

29:48.078 --> 29:49.910
the cops when they get here?

29:51.206 --> 29:52.206
Fuck.

29:52.249 --> 29:53.309
Did you throw hot
coffee on my face?

29:53.333 --> 29:56.041
It's fucking on fire.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.664
Oh God!

30:02.634 --> 30:03.715
What?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.794
What the fuck are
you looking at?

30:05.887 --> 30:07.879
I'm just looking at your face.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.089
Yeah?

30:09.182 --> 30:10.618
Yeah, well, I'm sure it
looks pretty fucked up.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.100
Thank you.

30:13.979 --> 30:17.893
Why didn't you want
me to go with you?

30:17.983 --> 30:19.349
What?

30:20.277 --> 30:22.234
When I asked to
leave with you,

30:22.321 --> 30:24.654
why didn't you want
me to come with you?

30:24.740 --> 30:26.276
Why?

30:26.366 --> 30:29.905
That's fucking crazy.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.657
I don't know you.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.330
There's no reason for
you to get involved.

30:34.416 --> 30:38.501
This didn't have to
be this complicated.

30:38.587 --> 30:41.955
I didn't think Sheila would get
shot, that wasn't what I wanted.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.665
Well, you made it happen.

30:46.511 --> 30:50.596
Okay, Melinda, seriously, you
got to let me out of here.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.514
Okay, I'm not going to hurt you.

30:52.601 --> 30:53.953
Okay, I just need to
give them their money

30:53.977 --> 30:56.390
or else they're
going to kill me.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.312
Who's going to kill you?

30:58.398 --> 31:00.981
The-the-the-the bikers.

31:01.068 --> 31:03.981
The the fucking clown stupid
assholes who care too much about

31:04.071 --> 31:07.109
their dumb motorcycles.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.471
Okay, well, they know that
I'm robbing this place,

31:11.495 --> 31:12.555
and if I don't give
them their money,

31:12.579 --> 31:14.536
they're going to come
here looking for me.

31:16.541 --> 31:20.455
Well, why didn't you
just leave with me then?

31:23.465 --> 31:26.674
You haven't called
the cops, have you?

31:31.098 --> 31:32.839
What's your plan?

31:33.642 --> 31:35.759
I'm not sure.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.184
Listen, Melinda,

31:41.274 --> 31:43.891
you and I are in lot of
trouble right now.

31:46.071 --> 31:49.280
At this point,
you're my accomplice.

31:49.366 --> 31:52.404
You helped me get the money.

31:52.494 --> 31:57.205
Because you threw hot coffee
on my face, Sheila is dead.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.953
And at some point someone's
going to figure out

32:00.043 --> 32:02.126
that Sheila's dead.

32:02.212 --> 32:05.171
So let's get out of here while
we still can, together.

32:05.257 --> 32:08.876
Look I know I can trust you now.

32:08.969 --> 32:11.177
Because we're on the same team.

32:11.263 --> 32:14.427
But, I was always on your team.

32:14.516 --> 32:18.055
I got you the money
from the safe.

32:18.145 --> 32:19.352
You're right.

32:23.233 --> 32:26.351
I just didn't want
you to get in trouble.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.588
I didn't want you to get hurt.

32:27.612 --> 32:30.446
I didn't want
anybody to get hurt.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.407
Except Sheila.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.574
No.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.869
Instead of leaving with me,
you decided to stay,

32:36.955 --> 32:38.412
and try to have sex with her.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.660
I wasn't trying to
have sex with Sheila.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.826
Melinda, I lost my temper.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.253
Okay, it's-it's-it's
a problem that I have,

32:46.339 --> 32:48.456
and it's something
that I'm working on.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.460
But what were you going to do?

32:52.554 --> 32:54.420
What, you were going
to come with me?

32:54.514 --> 32:56.722
To deliver the money?

32:56.808 --> 32:59.346
I mean, come on.

32:59.436 --> 33:00.893
Those guys, if they saw you,

33:00.979 --> 33:03.892
a pretty, pretty girl
like you, with me,

33:03.982 --> 33:05.835
they could have murdered you,
they could have raped you,

33:05.859 --> 33:07.475
just to get back at me.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.310
I didn't want that, okay?

33:19.539 --> 33:22.998
I mean, I guess also why I
didn't say yes, was...

33:24.711 --> 33:27.499
I didn't believe you.

33:27.589 --> 33:29.501
Believe what?

33:29.591 --> 33:32.755
Believe that you'd actually
want to leave with me.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.842
I wasn't lying to you.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.844
No.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.927
Yeah, no, I-I-I believe you now.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.956
It just didn't, it didn't make
sense to me at the time

33:43.980 --> 33:46.222
why why you'd want to
come away with me.

33:46.316 --> 33:49.104
I'm breaking the law
because I have to.

33:49.194 --> 33:52.437
I don't want to be
doing this, okay?

33:52.531 --> 33:55.820
And it didn't make sense to me
that someone like you would want

33:55.909 --> 33:57.678
to just throw their life away
and take off with a stranger

33:57.702 --> 33:59.284
with a gun.

33:59.371 --> 34:03.035
I mean, I know I'm
handsome, but...

34:05.043 --> 34:09.629
Unless you were just planning
on robbing the place yourself.

34:10.340 --> 34:13.299
Or you're just that
unhappy with your life.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.635
Are you?

34:16.721 --> 34:19.964
Are you that unhappy
with your life?

34:20.058 --> 34:23.301
I mean you do work
at a gas station.

34:23.395 --> 34:26.228
There's nothing wrong with
working at a gas station.

34:26.313 --> 34:28.681
I meet a lot of
interesting people.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.643
Gas stations are community
gathering centers.

34:31.735 --> 34:32.897
Oh.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.355
There was this famous architect
named Frank Lloyd Wright.

34:35.447 --> 34:37.030
Everyone thought he
was a genius,

34:37.117 --> 34:39.905
and he was obsessed
with gas stations.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.737
He even built this really
artistic one in Minnesota.

34:42.831 --> 34:45.995
He said in the future, gas
stations would be where every

34:46.083 --> 34:48.621
town would gather to
socialize and talk

34:48.712 --> 34:52.331
and get to know one another.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.666
I'm going to visit it one day.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.043
Wow, that's very interesting.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.675
I didn't think of it
that way, I guess yeah.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.524
I mean, on a busy shift I
usually meet around

35:01.558 --> 35:03.515
two hundred and forty customers.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.891
Some of them are regulars, but
I'm always meeting new people.

35:06.980 --> 35:10.314
Unless I work a graveyard
shift like tonight.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.017
After midnight I sometimes
only meet like twenty people.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.774
And then you meet
an asshole like me.

35:15.864 --> 35:20.325
But hey, I'm glad I met you.

35:21.661 --> 35:24.278
People don't usually give me
the chance to get to know me.

35:24.372 --> 35:27.410
They usually want to
get to know Sheila.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.538
Fuck Sheila.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.357
Melinda, I've met a thousand
girls like Sheila,

35:33.381 --> 35:36.545
and there's nothing
special about her.

35:37.218 --> 35:41.929
But you, you and I,
we're a lot alike.

35:42.015 --> 35:45.099
In a good way.

35:45.185 --> 35:46.892
We go for what we want.

35:50.357 --> 35:53.896
Oh...

35:53.985 --> 35:56.272
I would love a cigarette.
Do you have a cigarette?

35:56.988 --> 35:59.230
Yeah.

36:07.957 --> 36:10.324
Ah, thanks.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.587
I still can't believe you
threw hot coffee in my face.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.335
Burns like hell.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.791
It's not a bad thing.

36:18.885 --> 36:21.628
I burn myself all the time.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.337
See?

36:24.933 --> 36:27.892
You're just feeling
a quick change.

36:27.977 --> 36:31.061
I know it hurts, but it doesn't
have to be a bad thing.

36:31.147 --> 36:34.265
Fire just forces things
to change really fast.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.521
Like when a forest burns down,

36:36.611 --> 36:39.854
it all just grows
back even better,

36:39.948 --> 36:42.531
and the fire was just turning
it back to what it used to be

36:42.617 --> 36:43.617
in the first place.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.113
Okay, uh, Melinda,

36:45.203 --> 36:48.037
you know I really want to
keep talking with you,

36:48.123 --> 36:51.491
but I could use some
Advil or something,

36:51.584 --> 36:52.825
if you wouldn't mind.

36:59.092 --> 37:02.335
Hey!

37:03.888 --> 37:06.756
I'm really sorry
about all this.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.591
You deserve better.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.001
I wish would have
just left with you.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.038
Oh, thank you.

38:25.345 --> 38:29.009
Thanks.

38:29.098 --> 38:30.634
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

38:30.725 --> 38:32.967
I really want to go see that
gas station in Montana

38:33.061 --> 38:33.892
you were talking about.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.436
That sounds so cool.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.104
Alright?

38:37.190 --> 38:38.226
Once we get out of town

38:38.316 --> 38:39.916
that's the first place
we're going to go.

38:39.943 --> 38:43.357
I want to leave with you, but
I just need to figure out

38:43.446 --> 38:46.689
what to tell my boyfriend.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.657
You have a boyfriend?

38:49.369 --> 38:51.076
I do, yeah.

38:55.625 --> 38:59.744
Has he... will-will-will he
be worried about you? Or...

39:01.256 --> 39:03.339
Maybe.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.962
But I don't care.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.419
I want to leave with
you like you said.

39:08.513 --> 39:09.799
Right.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.801
It just makes things a
lot more complicated.

39:11.891 --> 39:14.245
It's not that big of a deal,
I don't really like him anyway.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.477
Okay.

39:16.563 --> 39:17.770
Okay, yeah, but

39:17.856 --> 39:18.856
how about this?

39:18.940 --> 39:20.852
How about I go alone to
give them the money

39:20.942 --> 39:23.810
and then-then you stay here
and you call the cops

39:23.903 --> 39:25.422
and-and once they get here
you can just tell them

39:25.446 --> 39:28.939
that somebody robbed the
store and then shot Sheila.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.511
And then, and then once
that's all sorted,

39:30.535 --> 39:32.367
we'll meet back up and
we'll get out of town

39:32.453 --> 39:36.322
before anybody realized
what happened.

39:36.416 --> 39:38.703
Don't you want to
leave together still?

39:38.793 --> 39:41.627
Yes, but you have a boyfriend.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.914
Is that going to stop you?

39:45.008 --> 39:47.751
No, but Melinda, it just makes
things really complicated

39:47.844 --> 39:50.131
for us to leave right now.

39:51.598 --> 39:52.679
Does it still hurt?

39:54.893 --> 39:59.308
Oh yeah, ha, yeah,
thanks for reminding me.

40:11.826 --> 40:14.239
Thanks.

40:17.624 --> 40:21.368
Melinda, you know what, look if
you really don't give a fuck

40:21.461 --> 40:25.330
about your boyfriend,
then let's do it.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.507
Let's go, but only if
we do it right now.

40:28.593 --> 40:31.051
Okay?

40:31.137 --> 40:34.175
Come on, what are you doing?

40:42.148 --> 40:43.605
Oh fuck.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.641
My heart.

40:45.735 --> 40:46.735
Ah.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.191
Okay, Melinda.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.273
Whoa, did you fucking drug me?

40:54.535 --> 40:57.744
Oh come on, Melinda, let's stop
fucking around, okay, let's go.

40:57.830 --> 41:00.447
Let's get the fuck
out of here, please.

41:00.541 --> 41:03.705
Ohhhh.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.833
Oh no-no-no-no okay, stop please
please-please-please stop.

41:06.923 --> 41:08.789
Uh, Melinda, what are you doing?

41:08.883 --> 41:10.749
What are you doing?

41:14.639 --> 41:17.632
Look-look, hey we can
do this later, okay?

41:18.142 --> 41:20.259
Just, let's get out of here.

41:22.647 --> 41:25.390
I know you're lying to me.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.816
I know you don't like me.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.986
The second I untie you I know
you're going to kill me.

41:31.072 --> 41:33.564
I know this is all a lie.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.369
But I'm going to
be okay with it.

41:53.553 --> 41:55.840
Fuck!

45:14.754 --> 45:16.857
Since when the hell
do you all close at night?

45:16.881 --> 45:19.419
I been out there ten minutes
banging on that door.

45:36.275 --> 45:39.268
Hey, where's the
regular coffee?

45:39.737 --> 45:42.400
We don't
have any right now.

45:43.491 --> 45:45.904
Don't have
any right now?

45:45.993 --> 45:47.780
You're a damn gas station.

45:47.870 --> 45:50.738
Can you make some?

45:50.831 --> 45:52.743
No.

45:52.833 --> 45:55.701
We have ice coffee and
energy drinks in the fridge.

45:55.795 --> 45:57.661
Energy drinks?

45:57.755 --> 45:59.337
This is goddamned ridiculous.

46:02.885 --> 46:05.218
No hot coffee!

46:05.304 --> 46:07.170
I can't have energy drinks.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.632
I can get a damn heart attack.

46:09.725 --> 46:12.468
Lose control of the wheel.

46:12.561 --> 46:14.097
Hit a bus.

46:15.106 --> 46:16.142
What the hell?

46:18.818 --> 46:20.650
I don't even know what
half this shit is.

46:20.736 --> 46:22.102
Whatever happened to coffee?

46:22.196 --> 46:24.313
Why do we have to have
all these choices?

46:26.450 --> 46:29.033
...This whole country,
this whole country

46:29.120 --> 46:32.909
is going to hell in a handbag.

46:49.598 --> 46:53.012
Look, I don't know
what your issue is,

46:55.396 --> 46:56.516
but I just want some coffee.

46:58.274 --> 47:00.436
Can I, can I pay for this?

47:01.527 --> 47:03.234
Please, just take what
you want and leave.

47:03.321 --> 47:05.028
Look I'm not asking
for a handout.

47:05.114 --> 47:07.106
Please, just leave me alone.

47:59.210 --> 48:02.624
Filson County 911
where's your emergency?

48:02.713 --> 48:04.329
Hello.

48:04.423 --> 48:05.423
This is the 911 operator

48:05.466 --> 48:07.799
Hey, Melinda.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.717
What are you doing?

48:11.097 --> 48:13.214
Where's Sheila at?

48:13.307 --> 48:15.390
She's not here.

48:15.476 --> 48:16.536
What do you mean,
she's not here.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.643
What? What, she leave already?

48:18.729 --> 48:21.767
She's not here anymore.

48:22.525 --> 48:24.312
Uh, what's the matter?

48:24.402 --> 48:27.395
Nothing.

48:28.072 --> 48:30.485
I been trying to call
her for like an hour.

48:30.574 --> 48:32.361
She knew I was picking her up.

48:32.451 --> 48:34.943
What, she get a ride?

48:35.037 --> 48:38.872
Who the hell gave
her a ride?

48:38.958 --> 48:42.247
I don't know, I didn't see,
I just know she's gone.

48:42.336 --> 48:45.579
Wha-what did she say to you?

48:45.673 --> 48:48.211
Was she mad at me?

48:48.300 --> 48:49.940
I told her I was
finishing up at the shop.

48:52.888 --> 48:55.426
Damn it, she always
does this shit.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.396
If I see her,
I'll let you know.

49:11.615 --> 49:13.572
Yeah.

49:21.542 --> 49:23.033
What is that?

49:24.253 --> 49:25.710
Shhh.

49:27.214 --> 49:30.002
Is that her phone vibrating?

49:47.651 --> 49:49.091
What's her phone
doing on the ground?

49:53.365 --> 49:55.903
She can't go two minutes
without her phone.

49:55.993 --> 49:57.484
Where is she?

49:57.578 --> 49:58.785
She still here?

49:58.871 --> 50:00.737
No, she left.

50:00.831 --> 50:04.290
You're not lying to me, are you?

50:04.376 --> 50:07.710
She's not like in the bathroom
or the back or something?

50:08.672 --> 50:11.289
Because if she left, she's going
to realize that her phone is

50:11.383 --> 50:13.966
missing in like two minutes
and come back for it.

50:14.053 --> 50:16.090
Why do you keep crying?

50:16.180 --> 50:18.172
I'm sorry.

50:18.265 --> 50:23.181
Look, hey, hey, hey, Melinda
listen to me, it's okay.

50:23.270 --> 50:24.748
This is my girl we're
talking about, alright,

50:24.772 --> 50:28.311
just... I don't give a shit
alright, if she's mad at me,

50:28.400 --> 50:30.483
or if she got you to
lie for her.

50:30.569 --> 50:32.310
Alright, I just need to
know where she is

50:32.404 --> 50:34.145
aright, and that she's okay.

50:34.240 --> 50:35.151
That's all that matters
to me aright?

50:35.241 --> 50:38.200
That's all I care about.

50:38.285 --> 50:42.450
Look, if... if you're
lying to me,

50:42.540 --> 50:45.704
and something
happens to her,

50:45.793 --> 50:47.705
Melinda, I swear to God

50:47.795 --> 50:48.795
She left.

50:50.631 --> 50:52.213
With a guy.

50:54.552 --> 50:57.260
Shut up! A guy?

50:57.346 --> 50:59.053
What guy?

50:59.139 --> 51:02.223
I don't know.
I'd never seen him before.

51:02.309 --> 51:04.847
What'd... what'd
he... what'd he look like?

51:04.937 --> 51:09.181
Some guy.
He had like a jean jacket on.

51:09.275 --> 51:10.732
What?

51:10.818 --> 51:13.731
Did she know him, were they like
touchy or something together?

51:13.821 --> 51:14.821
Yeah.

51:14.863 --> 51:16.216
I think they went to
a motel or something.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.856
They what?

51:25.082 --> 51:26.664
Did you get his name?

51:26.750 --> 51:27.490
Was his name Devon?

51:27.585 --> 51:29.076
Was it Devon?

51:29.169 --> 51:29.829
I didn't hear it.

51:29.920 --> 51:30.956
I'm really sorry.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.709
What motel they go to, Melinda?

51:33.799 --> 51:35.381
I don't know.

51:35.467 --> 51:38.301
Everything just
happened really fast.

51:45.227 --> 51:46.968
Okay.

51:47.062 --> 51:49.850
Look, I'm going to uh...

51:49.940 --> 51:53.149
I'm going to go to the Motel 6
on the eighteen, alright?

51:53.235 --> 51:56.103
If she comes back for her
phone, you tell her I have it.

51:56.196 --> 51:58.438
Alright, and she better
wait here for me.

51:58.532 --> 52:03.072
Alright, do not let her
leave before I get back.

52:03.162 --> 52:04.369
Okay.

52:04.455 --> 52:05.662
Alright.

52:05.748 --> 52:10.163
Look, thanks for
telling me, Melinda.

54:02.698 --> 54:05.190
Can I help you guys?

54:05.284 --> 54:06.803
Yeah, we were thinking of
going in the store

54:06.827 --> 54:10.537
and um buying some things.

54:10.622 --> 54:12.100
I'm sorry, I'd really
like to help you guys

54:12.124 --> 54:15.242
and normally I would, but
right now the store is closed.

54:15.335 --> 54:18.828
Yeah, the sign says 24 hours.

54:18.922 --> 54:23.383
Yes, but not today's 24 hours.

54:25.137 --> 54:27.174
Did something
happen here tonight?

54:27.264 --> 54:29.130
No, nothing happened.

54:29.224 --> 54:31.762
I'm just cleaning
up a little mess.

54:31.852 --> 54:33.684
We're looking for a
friend of ours.

54:33.771 --> 54:36.309
A little wannabe
cowboy type.

54:36.398 --> 54:38.685
'Bout this tall with
his high heel boots on.

54:38.776 --> 54:41.234
You'd know him if you saw him.

54:43.614 --> 54:45.355
Do you guys do illegal things?

54:48.327 --> 54:49.818
Of course not.

54:49.912 --> 54:52.120
You don't accidentally
kill people

54:52.206 --> 54:53.663
and get rid of dead bodies?

54:53.749 --> 54:56.787
What kind of people
do we look like?

54:56.877 --> 54:59.711
We're just looking
for our friend.

54:59.797 --> 55:01.880
I haven't seen him.

55:01.965 --> 55:03.957
How are you so sure?

55:04.051 --> 55:05.542
Well, he said I'd
know if he came,

55:05.636 --> 55:08.344
and I don't know if he
came so nothing happened.

55:09.973 --> 55:11.839
I'm going to get some smokes.

55:11.934 --> 55:14.677
Uh, excuse me, I said we're
closed you can't go in.

55:14.770 --> 55:17.012
In fact I was just
going to lock the door.

55:17.105 --> 55:18.666
You can do that right
after I get my cigarettes.

55:18.690 --> 55:20.352
I said you can't go in.

55:21.860 --> 55:23.817
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

55:27.574 --> 55:30.237
Have you lost your
fucking mind?

55:30.327 --> 55:32.068
It's very possible.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.700
Now can you please just leave?

55:34.790 --> 55:38.875
I'm just, I'm really,
really busy right now.

55:40.504 --> 55:42.746
Put your pieces down.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.297
What!

55:44.383 --> 55:46.420
You heard me.
Put 'em away!

55:48.011 --> 55:50.219
There's cameras everywhere.

55:50.305 --> 55:51.921
No need to make a scene.

55:52.015 --> 55:55.850
She says the store is closed,
I guess it's closed.

55:55.936 --> 55:59.100
We're going to take
a look around.

55:59.189 --> 56:02.523
And if we don't find our
friend, we're coming back.

56:02.609 --> 56:05.773
Maybe the store will
be open by then.

59:40.702 --> 59:42.489
Oh, Melinda.

59:42.579 --> 59:43.911
Are you okay?

59:45.707 --> 59:47.573
Is there anyone else
in here with you.

59:47.667 --> 59:49.624
No, it's just me.

59:49.711 --> 59:51.168
You're here by yourself?

59:51.254 --> 59:52.711
Yes.

59:56.093 --> 01:00:00.007
Did you notice anyone
suspicious come through?

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:03.090
Uh, I don't know.

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:05.550
Who's suspicious?

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:09.771
You can put your hands down.

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:13.086
There's a grey Toyota
Camry in the parking lot

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.646
right next to your van.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:17.399
That's the stolen
vehicle I'm looking for.

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:20.027
Did you notice it outside?

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:22.200
No.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:26.245
Keys were still in the ignition.

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:28.448
When was the last time
you looked outside?

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:32.252
Maybe twenty minutes ago.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.044
Okay.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:35.212
I'll check the tapes.

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:39.918
Tom 66, 1124 on the 503 copy.

01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:43.254
Uh, Liu, you don't
need to use codes every time.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:44.930
Just say it.

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:48.475
Stolen vehicle abandoned
at Paradise Pumps on the 63.

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:49.928
Suspect missing.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:51.728
I'll clear the location.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.815
Melinda, you okay?

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:59.896
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.676
I don't think we can
look at the tapes though;

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.441
I can't access them.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.367
Well, who has access?

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:06.569
Diane?

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:11.328
Yes, but she's not here.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:16.329
I hate to have her
drive down at this hour.

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:18.335
Nah, I've got to do
it, what's her number?

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:21.133
She's definitely
sleeping right now.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:22.801
I hear what you're saying.

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:26.381
I hate to wake her, but I'm
just trying to do my job.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:28.682
You know, just follow procedure.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:30.475
What's her number?

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:35.398
I actually, I remember now
something suspicious happening.

01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:38.191
Okay, let's call Diane first
and when she's on her way,

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:40.235
then I want to hear what
you have to tell me.

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:42.109
That way we're firing
on all cylinders.

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:43.656
Not wasting any time.

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:47.827
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.480
They should really
give you the keys,

01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:59.417
you're the most
dependable one here.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:07.839
I think you're right,
she's probably asleep.

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:09.549
Yeah, she was really tired.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:10.828
Plus I don't think
you'll need...

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:11.871
Hold on, let me try again.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.227
What?

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:15.521
Sometimes when you...
it takes a couple of tries,

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:17.269
and you know, when
you call twice,

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.567
people generally take
that as an emergency.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:21.353
Diane?

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:22.732
Hi.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:24.300
I'm sorry to wake you, uh,
this is Officer Liu

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:26.691
of the Filson County
Sheriff's department.

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:29.243
Yes, hi.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:32.072
Uh, we have a situation here at
the Paradise Pumps and we're

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:36.500
going to need to see the
surveillance tapes ASAP.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.793
Yeah, Melinda's right here.

01:02:37.879 --> 01:02:40.963
She says you're the only one
that has access to them.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:44.671
Uh huh.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:48.721
I'm sorry, Diane, I know this is
unfair but we have a situation?

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.639
I'm not authorized
to give you a raise.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.876
I personally can't compensate
you to drive down here.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:02.064
As a police officer I'm ordering
you to come down with the keys

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:03.564
and show me the tapes.

01:03:03.655 --> 01:03:05.817
Is that clear?

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:09.116
Thank you.

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.034
She's a very negative person.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:17.537
Okay, so what were you saying?

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:21.086
I was saying that I remember
something suspicious now.

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:23.609
About half an hour ago someone
came in asking about the nearest

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:28.173
hotel and I told them about
the Motel 6 by the eighteen.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:31.051
He was the last person I saw
since that car showed up,

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:34.054
and I think he left
in a green jeep.

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:38.559
And you're saying this
person was suspicious, how?

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:42.104
He was just suspicious.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:44.150
You can take my word for it.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:46.653
Okay.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.481
Hum.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:51.192
Sorry I couldn't
remember that earlier

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:55.405
when you were pointing
the gun at me.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.615
I apologize about that.

01:03:57.709 --> 01:03:59.575
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.535
I'm fine.

01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:02.898
You might actually be
able to catch him still

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:04.709
if you leave right now.

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:06.837
Did you get a license plate?

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.292
Uh, no.

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:13.760
Wow.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.842
That's one hell of
a first night.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.433
Tom 66, possible suspect
in a green jeep.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:23.941
Be on the lookout for all
green jeeps near the eighteen.

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:27.646
Alright, I'm going to go check
out the Motel 6 and by the time

01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:30.823
I get back, Diane should be
here and we'll check the tapes.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.220
I'm just going to do a
quick sweep of the store

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:34.555
just to make sure
we're all clear.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:35.579
A quick sweep?

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:37.029
Yeah, it's just procedure.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:40.457
But I said he's not here.

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:44.044
Melinda, is everything alright?

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.541
Yes.

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:48.215
You keep asking me that
and I keep telling you yes.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.720
Do you not believe me?

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:58.510
Hey, if there's
something you know,

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.060
or there's something wrong,

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:02.833
you know you can tell me, right?

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:04.043
I just want to make
sure you're safe

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:07.026
and I don't want anything
happening to you.

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:08.353
I care about you.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:09.732
You don't need to say that.

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:13.198
Say what?

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:16.652
I know you're just
doing your job.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:19.454
You're always just
doing your job.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:22.204
You don't need to say
all that extra stuff to me.

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:23.521
You've never said it
to me before,

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:26.083
you don't need to
say it now.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.913
It's too late.

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:30.875
I'm sorry, but I mean it
when I say I care about you.

01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:36.055
You don't even really
know who am, so...

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:37.632
it's not real.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.266
I'm going to go
sweep the premises.

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:41.863
Alright.

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:44.039
Everything looks good.

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:47.459
I'll go check on the Motel 6.

01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:50.003
Who has the morning shift?

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:51.625
Uh.

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:55.130
I'm not sure.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.756
Okay.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.462
I'll go check on the jeep.

01:06:58.556 --> 01:06:59.922
I'll be back.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:04.932
Okay. You didn't find
anything strange?

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.062
Nope.

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:09.606
Just like you said.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.979
I believed you the whole time.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:16.193
Look, if you see anything
or need anything,

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:17.682
my cell phone
number's on this card.

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.199
You can call me directly.

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:51.287
Hello?

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:59.225
Melinda?

01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:05.144
This is your last chance.

01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:09.232
Do not fuck with me!

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:30.461
Melinda!

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:32.797
Okay, stop!

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:35.507
Please, stop now, please.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:37.843
I'll burn this whole
place down right now.

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:41.180
The floor is covered
with gasoline.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:49.025
Melinda, give me the
fucking backpack.

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:52.779
You can have it if you let me go
and if you don't tell anybody

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:56.909
what happened, I'll
give it to you.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:12:59.785
What's going on?

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:00.912
What are you doing?

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:02.994
Uh, it won't open.

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:05.044
The security locks the
door when the power's out.

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:09.924
Why is the power out?

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:11.843
Did Sheila come back?

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.637
Melinda, is Sheila here?

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:17.216
Hey, Melinda!

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.676
Where you going?

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.802
- Hey, who are you?
- Listen, listen. You gotta?

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.443
- Whoa, what happened to you?
- You, you gotta trust me.

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:50.548
Back up.

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:52.112
Okay, okay. This bitch,
she's totally crazy, man.

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:53.216
She burned my fucking face.

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:54.048
She tied me to a chair.

01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:55.138
She tried to rape me.

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:56.408
She shot her fucking coworker.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.701
Now she's going to burn
the whole place down.

01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:58.744
Whoa, whoa.
What did you say?

01:13:58.768 --> 01:13:59.828
She's going to burn
the whole fucking...

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.163
No, no, no. About her
coworker, what'd you...

01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:02.497
She shot her fucking coworker.
She's out of her fucking mind.

01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:03.832
what are you talking
about, her coworker?

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:04.596
I don't fucking believe you.
What are you talking about?

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:05.690
Stop!

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:06.835
- The blond chick.
- What are you talking about?

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.942
- Stay back.
- I-I-I promise you.

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:11.089
- What are you talking about!
- I promise, I promise, okay?

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:13.008
- I'm just a customer.
- What is he talking about?

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:14.148
I'm just a customer, okay?

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:15.721
Where's Sheila?
Where the fuck is she?

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.367
- Did you do something to her?
- No.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.493
- Did you fucking shoot her?
- No, no, it wasn't me.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.366
Did you hurt her?

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:21.642
I was just trying
to help, he's...

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:23.706
- Tell me the truth!
- He's the one who shot Sheila.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:28.463
Hey, stop it.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.252
You can have it and you
can just leave...

01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:33.880
You can take the money and
leave, just like you wanted.

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.381
Stop!

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:41.345
Stop!

01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:47.393
Stop it!

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:13.586
Easy!

01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:03.465
Officer Liu?

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.892
Hi, it's Melinda.

01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:10.435
No it's not okay.

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:13.733
Could you please just
come back, I...

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:16.486
No, just listen.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:20.942
I lied, I lied about
the guy, I...

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:23.986
Yes, I think so, but
the doors are locked,

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.946
and the power's out
and I can't get out of...

01:16:44.308 --> 01:16:45.786
The money is right
there on the counter.

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:48.678
Please, you can just
take it and leave.

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.391
I'm sorry.

01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:57.273
I really didn't mean for
all of this to happen, it...

01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:58.524
Please.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.854
I'll burn the whole place down
and we can just forget it.

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:08.975
You were going to take the
fuckin' money and run,

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:11.116
weren't you?

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:14.874
Yes, but I thought you were
dead and I just figured?

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:18.548
But you can have it, it's
all there, I promise.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:19.545
Oh, and your gun.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:22.173
Don't forget that,
you can have that too.

01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:26.132
Look, the police are going
to be here an minute.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:29.593
You, you called the police?

01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:33.021
Yes, but you still have
time, you can just leave.

01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:37.067
You can, you can just leave.

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:40.021
This didn't have to be
complicated Melinda.

01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:42.322
I know.

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:45.242
You made me into a killer.

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.944
I don't think I made
you kill anybody.

01:17:48.038 --> 01:17:49.950
I mean you definitely
didn't need to kill Perry,

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.034
he was just really
in love with Sheila.

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:55.960
But you're right, I'm
sorry I screwed up.

01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:59.881
Stop with all your
fucking I'm sorrys.

01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:06.430
You drugged me and
tried to rape me.

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:10.168
Do you think that you were just
going to get away with that?

01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:16.728
I just, I just wanted to
be with someone, I just,

01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:19.730
I just forgot what I wanted.

01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:23.471
What, what are you going to tell
the cops when they get here?

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:26.553
Are you going to
tell them about me?

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:29.661
Are you going to
tell them about you?

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:32.239
I'll tell them the truth.

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:33.824
All of it.

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:39.003
The truth.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:41.339
Umn uh.

01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:44.133
No.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:49.011
No, that's, that's not
going to be enough.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:53.681
Not after what you did.

01:20:16.562 --> 01:20:20.306
Melinda? Melinda? Come
on, come on. I got you.

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:23.767
I got you. I got
you. I got you.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:27.696
It's okay, I got you.
Here we go, let's go!

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:30.444
Come on okay!
We're almost there.

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:32.196
We'll get you to safety.

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:34.869
Come on.

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:36.696
Watch your head,
watch your head.

01:20:37.916 --> 01:20:40.875
Hold tight. Things
are going to be okay.

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:43.328
Help is on the way.

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:44.287
Tom 66.

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:46.122
We have a large fire
at Paradise Pumps.

01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:48.128
I have a conscious,
adult female,

01:20:48.218 --> 01:20:52.132
severe burns to the legs.
I need EMS immediately.

01:20:52.222 --> 01:20:55.511
Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.763
I should have never left you.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:00.095
I was just trying
to follow procedure.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:03.523
I'm so sorry.

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:04.609
What can I do?

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:05.479
Tell me, what can I do?

01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:07.185
How can I help right now?

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:11.565
You're telling the truth.

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:12.899
What?

01:21:19.666 --> 01:21:23.000
Melinda, what happened tonight?
