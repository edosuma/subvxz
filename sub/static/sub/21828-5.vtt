00:03.250 --> 00:05.333
Previously, on MECH-X4...

00:05.417 --> 00:07.000
-Found your birth father.
-Really?

00:07.083 --> 00:08.792
But he's been in an accident.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.667
And if you don't do something...

00:12.333 --> 00:14.083
you might lose him forever.

00:22.083 --> 00:24.291
Randall! Over here.
Over here.

00:25.834 --> 00:28.000
-Were you followed?
-They're right behind me.

00:28.083 --> 00:29.625
They came to the house.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.959
Oh, Randall, I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

00:32.041 --> 00:33.500
W-W-What can I do?

00:34.208 --> 00:35.917
You can protect my son.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.417
He won't be safe with us,

00:37.500 --> 00:39.333
with those people out there
hunting us down.

00:39.417 --> 00:40.625
Who are they?

00:40.709 --> 00:43.542
They're with Harper.
Who else could it be?

00:44.458 --> 00:46.458
-What are you gonna do?
-Leave town.

00:46.542 --> 00:48.917
Change my identity,
keep on running until they give up.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.709
-(man) This way!
-(footsteps)

00:50.792 --> 00:53.834
-They're coming.
-Are you sure you can keep him safe?

00:53.917 --> 00:57.500
I promise. I will find him
a nice family to live with.

01:01.333 --> 01:03.000
He doesn't like strained peas.

01:03.583 --> 01:07.166
And this is Mr. Wooby.
He never goes to sleep without him.

01:08.125 --> 01:09.917
I love you so much.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.375
Which is why I have to leave you here.

01:13.208 --> 01:14.500
(cooing)

01:17.333 --> 01:18.667
(man) Over here!

01:18.750 --> 01:20.166
-I gotta go.
-Mm-hmm.

01:20.250 --> 01:21.250
Thanks, Leo.

01:21.333 --> 01:23.333
Maybe we'll see each other
again someday.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.917
Good luck, Randall.

01:25.709 --> 01:28.417
Oh, wait. What's his name?

01:29.208 --> 01:30.625
Ryan.

01:31.291 --> 01:32.458
His name's Ryan.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.667
I'll draw them away from you.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.917
Leave me alone!

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
-There he is!
-After him!

01:43.083 --> 01:44.709
(man) Go! Go!

01:49.458 --> 01:51.333
-(crying)
-Shh. It's okay.

01:51.417 --> 01:52.959
It's okay, don't cry.

01:58.375 --> 02:00.083
(electricity crackles)

02:01.291 --> 02:03.166
Wow.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.166
I knew you had powers, but wow.

02:09.125 --> 02:10.709
You are one special kid, Ryan.

02:15.250 --> 02:18.000
You're sure about this?
My birth father's in danger?

02:18.083 --> 02:20.166
Mm-hmm. He took a job as a miner

02:20.250 --> 02:23.500
for the McCallum Mining Concern,
but there was a collapse at his dig site.

02:23.583 --> 02:26.917
A cave-in? So... he's trapped?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.291
And the company's keeping
everything about it quiet.

02:29.375 --> 02:31.750
They must not have had
permission to drill there.

02:31.834 --> 02:34.250
They're leaving them to, uh...

02:34.792 --> 02:36.542
fend for themselves.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.458
So they left him there to die?

02:38.542 --> 02:40.125
Well, yeah...

02:40.208 --> 02:44.375
but you're a kid, so sometimes
I try to phrase things a little less...

02:44.458 --> 02:45.542
horribly.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.792
But yeah, they're leaving them to die.

02:49.417 --> 02:50.709
Well, I guess it's up to me.

02:52.333 --> 02:54.166
Let's go save my father.

02:54.250 --> 02:57.625
(theme music plays)

03:29.375 --> 03:31.291
I plotted a course to Mount Lancer.

03:31.375 --> 03:34.083
And I got travel brochures
for sightseeing along the way.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.250
Are you sure we can take
the robot out of the state?

03:36.333 --> 03:37.792
Grey and Harper are still out there.

03:37.875 --> 03:40.959
They know who we are.
We gotta protect Mom.

03:41.041 --> 03:43.750
Actually, I've got that covered.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.250
(chuckles)

03:45.333 --> 03:46.375
Ch-Cha!

03:47.709 --> 03:49.625
It's a home defense unit.

03:49.709 --> 03:51.333
So, we put this on top of your roof,

03:51.417 --> 03:53.542
and it's programmed
to detect all of our enemies.

03:53.625 --> 03:56.000
If it gets a hit, it'll let us know.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.709
I also wanted to have it
release killer bees,

03:58.792 --> 04:01.250
but capturing them
one at a time was taking forever.

04:01.333 --> 04:04.792
-This guy knows what I mean.
-No. Mm-mm.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.625
All right, I should stay and help Leo
Harper-proof our place.

04:07.709 --> 04:09.417
You gonna be all right?

04:09.500 --> 04:11.542
Totally. Go take care of Mom.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.917
Hey, Leo,
now that we're alone,

04:19.000 --> 04:20.750
there's something that
I wanted to ask you.

04:20.834 --> 04:22.500
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup bup-bup-bup.

04:22.583 --> 04:24.959
First, let me show you something.

04:25.041 --> 04:26.583
(chuckles)

04:26.667 --> 04:28.166
Yeah!

04:30.834 --> 04:34.083
My car! You rebuilt the Mark-mobile!

04:34.166 --> 04:37.333
I used MECH-X4's
repair nanites to rebuild it,

04:37.417 --> 04:39.625
and, I added a little surprise.

04:39.709 --> 04:40.834
-Lasers?
-No.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.583
-Missiles?
-Oh, no, no.

04:43.667 --> 04:46.792
How about the sweet scent of pine?

04:46.875 --> 04:50.750
Yeah, yeah, it took a while,
but I wanted to do something

04:50.834 --> 04:53.709
a little special,
just in case you were feeling

04:53.792 --> 04:55.083
a little less special.

04:56.083 --> 04:57.417
Why would I feel less special?

04:57.500 --> 05:00.166
Well, obviously, now that I'm back,

05:00.250 --> 05:02.250
and I know the robot inside and out,

05:02.333 --> 05:04.792
the team's gonna want me
to be the mechanic,

05:04.875 --> 05:06.375
and that's got to bum you out.

05:06.458 --> 05:09.166
It didn't, but it does now.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.667
Don't be bummed out.
I don't even want that terrible job.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.458
I made it up at the very end.
That's why there's no chair for you.

05:14.542 --> 05:17.959
Yeah, I noticed, but that's not why
I wanted to talk to you.

05:20.417 --> 05:22.792
Your experiments gave Ryan his powers.

05:22.875 --> 05:23.959
Yeah.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.083
Could you do that with me?

05:28.291 --> 05:29.959
Could you make me a technopath, too?

05:39.333 --> 05:41.625
(Harris) Okay, I can see
the mining company's op center.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.166
We're almost there.

05:43.250 --> 05:45.500
Hey, have you figured out
what you'll say

05:45.583 --> 05:46.792
to your dad when you meet him?

05:46.875 --> 05:49.750
Well, I'd lead with, "Hi. I'm Ryan Walker.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.750
Can I have 14 years worth
of Christmas presents, please?"

05:52.834 --> 05:56.083
I can't reveal my identity
to him, guys. Harper's back!

05:56.166 --> 05:58.625
And if he finds out about my father,
he'll go after him.

06:00.166 --> 06:03.250
Just... meeting him
will have to be enough.

06:04.709 --> 06:05.875
Hey, do we have time to stop?

06:05.959 --> 06:08.333
The world's largest cornflake
is near Mount Lancer.

06:08.417 --> 06:10.875
I found it on this blog called
"World's Greatest Hoaxes."

06:10.959 --> 06:13.458
Oh, Spyder. A hoax
is something that's not--

06:13.542 --> 06:15.333
Harris, just leave him his dreams.

06:26.250 --> 06:27.375
(Ryan) We're here.

06:28.083 --> 06:31.083
(Harris) I'm picking up
a signal from down there.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.625
Tapping into feed.

06:38.625 --> 06:39.917
It's really him.

06:46.083 --> 06:49.709
-Harris, what was that?
-(Harris) Scanning...

06:49.792 --> 06:52.083
The mountain is losing
structural integrity.

06:52.166 --> 06:53.792
It could collapse any minute.

06:53.875 --> 06:57.000
Don't worry,
we're coming for you. Just hang on.

07:01.333 --> 07:05.166
(Harris) Your dad is separated
from his team, all the miners are trapped.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.208
To rescue the miners,
we have to move now.

07:07.291 --> 07:09.792
There's an elevator that goes
to the chamber your father's in,

07:09.875 --> 07:11.750
but the controls got busted
during the cave-in.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.458
That's no problem for a technopath.

07:13.542 --> 07:15.917
We can't reach it,
that side of the mountain has collapsed.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.417
All right, then we'll make
a path for the elevator shaft.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.750
-(Ryan) Spyder?
-The drill's online.

07:20.834 --> 07:22.041
(Harris) Just be very careful.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.041
One wrong move
and the mountain could cave in.

07:24.125 --> 07:27.166
-Do you have any good news today?
-Um...

07:27.250 --> 07:29.500
-I got my first chest hair.
-Congrats, man.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.291
-Whoa.
-Thank you.

07:43.667 --> 07:45.375
(loud rumbling)

07:46.583 --> 07:47.834
(Harris) That's it.

07:47.917 --> 07:50.208
Nice... and easy.

07:50.291 --> 07:51.917
Almost there.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.625
-A little bit more.
-Take it slow.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.208
Slow!

07:59.542 --> 08:02.750
Ah! We're through. Pulling the drill out.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.458
We've made an entrance.

08:10.542 --> 08:13.041
-Nice job, guys.
-Yeah, but it won't last very long.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.000
You're just a ray of sunshine today.

08:15.083 --> 08:18.250
We'll zip down to the bottom of the mine
and rescue my dad and the miners,

08:18.333 --> 08:19.917
and then we'll zip right back up.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.750
Ryan, we could get trapped down there.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.959
We'll have to figure out
a way to keep the exit open.

08:24.041 --> 08:26.709
I could extend the shields
and keep the hole clear.

08:26.792 --> 08:28.583
I could blast any debris
that falls there.

08:28.667 --> 08:31.458
Okay, cool.
You two stay up here. Wish me luck.

08:33.834 --> 08:36.250
(Harris) It's going to be dark.
Grab the X-goggles.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.208
Ryan, how's it going?

08:50.291 --> 08:51.750
So far, so good.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.458
Looks like the control panel's busted.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.709
But, then again...

09:13.959 --> 09:15.583
(loud thud)

09:17.208 --> 09:19.750
(screeching metal)

09:20.166 --> 09:22.583
Ryan, you're moving kind of fast.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.125
Because I'm falling!

09:24.834 --> 09:27.041
Come on, there has
to be emergency brakes.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.375
Emergency brakes!

09:30.417 --> 09:32.083
Found them!

09:37.959 --> 09:39.083
(grunts)

09:39.166 --> 09:40.208
(groans)

09:45.166 --> 09:46.792
Uh...

09:48.542 --> 09:49.750
Hey! Um...

09:51.667 --> 09:53.417
Huh! Wow, yeah, I'm here.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.875
I mean, you're here.
I mean, I'm here to save you.

09:59.625 --> 10:02.125
Wait, aren't you a little young
to be a rescue worker?

10:02.208 --> 10:04.917
Yeah, I'm one of those child prodigies

10:05.000 --> 10:06.625
that specializes in, um,

10:06.709 --> 10:09.208
digging and saving dudes.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.834
(laughs)

10:10.917 --> 10:13.792
Okay, you know what?
I could use all the help I can get.

10:19.542 --> 10:21.250
You okay?

10:21.750 --> 10:23.625
Uh, yeah, uh...

10:24.417 --> 10:26.834
-How long have you been down here?
-Almost a week.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.250
My family must be worried sick.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.709
Yeah, uh, it must be tough.

10:31.792 --> 10:33.875
Family is... really important.

10:33.959 --> 10:36.041
(rumbling)

10:36.125 --> 10:38.291
We're running out of time.
We have to get out of here.

10:38.375 --> 10:41.625
My team is trapped behind this rubble
and I'm not leaving here without them.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.834
Yeah, of course.

10:42.917 --> 10:45.041
We need to get
all these rocks out of here.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.583
They're too heavy, I'm still
trying to figure out what to do.

10:47.667 --> 10:48.709
Watch this.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.875
That's fantastic tech.

11:03.291 --> 11:04.375
Where did you get this?

11:04.458 --> 11:07.000
Oh, uh, it's the latest
in rescue technology.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.166
Standard issue.

11:12.917 --> 11:14.291
(drill buzzing)

11:14.375 --> 11:17.458
Security rushes me out
the front door and that...

11:17.542 --> 11:18.959
is how I met Billy Joel.

11:19.041 --> 11:22.208
Leo, the question was,
"Can you make me a technopath?"

11:22.291 --> 11:25.250
Oh, right. Um...

11:25.709 --> 11:27.625
Sorry, Mark. No, I can't.

11:27.709 --> 11:30.291
Ryan got his powers by accident.

11:30.375 --> 11:33.291
Look, I get it.
I think I know what's going on here.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.208
You used to be the big man on campus

11:35.291 --> 11:37.500
and now it feels like
you're living in Ryan's shadow.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.333
Again, didn't think that
until you said it.

11:39.417 --> 11:41.500
-I got to stop saying stuff.
-I just want to help.

11:41.583 --> 11:44.709
He had to go after Grey,
Harper, his father.

11:44.792 --> 11:48.166
If I could pilot the robot,
he could get a break once in a while.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.834
You're a good brother, Mark,
but I still can't.

11:52.917 --> 11:56.208
What are you doing?
What is all this stuff--

11:56.291 --> 11:59.458
Why are you on the roof? And who's that?

12:00.959 --> 12:03.166
Those are all excellent questions.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.917
Mark...

12:13.750 --> 12:16.709
-Amazing.
-Yeah, it shouldn't take much longer now.

12:16.792 --> 12:18.417
Good, there's not much time.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.583
It must be hard, you know,

12:19.667 --> 12:22.083
-working such a dangerous job.
-Well...

12:23.625 --> 12:25.375
Uh, you mentioned you had a family?

12:25.458 --> 12:26.917
A wife.

12:28.333 --> 12:29.500
Any kids?

12:31.875 --> 12:34.375
Uh... no.

12:35.041 --> 12:36.333
No kids.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.583
But I do have people who depend on me,

12:38.667 --> 12:40.500
and they're on
the other side of these rocks.

12:42.792 --> 12:43.917
Are you okay?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.667
Seems like you got
something on your mind.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.959
What? No, no.
It's just two guys trapped in a mine,

12:49.041 --> 12:51.125
trying to make conversation, so.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.875
(miner) Hey, look! I don't believe it.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.625
-We're through.
-Come on, help him.

13:01.709 --> 13:03.625
(Ryan through intercom)
We found the miners.

13:03.709 --> 13:05.750
You guys hang on, okay?

13:05.834 --> 13:09.000
-(miners coughing)
-(Ryan) Let's go! Careful, careful.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.500
Come on, fellas, come on.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.792
That rock wall was supporting the ceiling.
It's all coming down!

13:16.875 --> 13:19.250
Come on! Let's get to the elevator!

13:19.333 --> 13:21.834
-Come on!
-Come on, move it! Move it!

13:21.917 --> 13:23.917
It's coming down!

13:26.667 --> 13:28.208
Look out!

13:30.458 --> 13:32.417
(groans)

13:32.500 --> 13:34.125
No!

13:34.917 --> 13:36.667
-Are you okay?
-My leg is pinned.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.208
The whole place is coming down. Go!

13:40.291 --> 13:42.959
-I'm not leaving without you!
-Kid, don't risk your life for me.

13:43.041 --> 13:44.875
-You don't even know me!
-Yes, I do!

13:49.750 --> 13:51.000
My name is Ryan.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.000
I'm your son.

14:01.125 --> 14:02.625
Ryan?

14:03.667 --> 14:05.083
Is it really you?

14:17.083 --> 14:18.625
Come on!

14:20.250 --> 14:21.542
Wait! Wait!

14:21.625 --> 14:23.333
(Ryan) Come on!

14:25.750 --> 14:27.834
-(miner 1) Come on, come on!
-(miner 2) Hurry up!

14:29.959 --> 14:31.959
Go, go, go!

14:41.542 --> 14:43.208
Come on, Ryan, you're almost there.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.208
(loud thud)

14:45.291 --> 14:46.750
-That's not good.
-It's okay.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.959
-(alarm ringing)
-Okay, that can't be good.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.083
(miner): What was that?

14:54.166 --> 14:56.875
-We stopped moving.
-Come on, guys, igure something out.

14:57.875 --> 15:00.917
Those rocks just blocked the exit.
They won't be able to get out!

15:01.000 --> 15:02.417
I got this.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.792
When defense doesn't work,
offense takes over.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.458
Spyder, are you nuts?

15:07.542 --> 15:09.417
Yes. Appreciate.

15:16.875 --> 15:19.083
You cleared the hole,
but the elevator's still jammed!

15:19.166 --> 15:21.125
Oh, I'm not done.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.834
Ryan, grappling grip!

15:22.917 --> 15:24.000
Got it!

15:35.083 --> 15:37.750
-What's going on?
-It's okay, just hang on.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.750
(Ryan) Everybody stay calm.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.625
We're being lifted to safety...

15:43.250 --> 15:44.834
somehow.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.542
Go, get to the infirmary.
I'll catch up with you guys in a sec.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.375
Are you okay?

16:08.709 --> 16:10.000
I'm fine.

16:10.375 --> 16:11.417
What just happened?

16:14.458 --> 16:15.917
That.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.917
(metal creaking)

16:19.917 --> 16:22.041
I kind of pilot a giant robot.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.291
(laughs)

16:25.500 --> 16:27.208
You pilot that?

16:29.083 --> 16:30.166
It's amazing.

16:36.917 --> 16:39.750
Thank you, Ryan.
Thank you for saving me.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.333
-And thank you for telling me the truth.
-I thought I was gonna lose you.

16:44.750 --> 16:46.208
I thought you should know who I am.

16:47.250 --> 16:48.542
Oh, son.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.083
I can't wait to spend time with you!

16:58.166 --> 16:59.417
What's wrong?

17:01.250 --> 17:02.709
I want to,

17:02.792 --> 17:04.667
but we can't, okay? It's dangerous.

17:07.625 --> 17:08.750
Do you remember Seth Harper?

17:10.542 --> 17:11.875
Remember him?

17:12.291 --> 17:13.625
That snake.

17:13.709 --> 17:16.208
He tried to hunt us down.
We had to hide you from him.

17:16.291 --> 17:19.458
And now I have to hide you from him.
He's still alive.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.542
When I saw his death in the news,
I knew it was too good to be true.

17:25.834 --> 17:27.375
He knows who I am.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.333
If he sees us together...

17:30.417 --> 17:32.375
He'll figure out who I am
and use me against you.

17:33.959 --> 17:35.625
I'm so sorry.

17:35.709 --> 17:36.959
Don't be sorry.

17:38.375 --> 17:41.709
If this is all the time we get,
then it'll have to be enough.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.375
You know, I always imagined...

17:46.458 --> 17:48.458
what you'd be like.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.709
But the real deal is so much better.

17:52.291 --> 17:54.333
(sirens wailing)

17:54.417 --> 17:57.000
Oh, uh, my friends
must have called for help.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.834
-Yeah, and I gotta--
-I gotta--

17:58.917 --> 18:00.041
(both laugh)

18:03.333 --> 18:06.834
(helicopter approaching)

18:06.917 --> 18:09.291
(sirens continue)

18:20.250 --> 18:23.125
So, you wanna tell me why you're up there?

18:23.208 --> 18:25.333
Uh, okay. I was...

18:25.417 --> 18:27.375
trying to sink a shot over the roof,

18:27.458 --> 18:29.417
and broke the satellite dish.

18:29.500 --> 18:34.208
And free of charge, we've upgraded you
to a bigger, bulkier satellite.

18:35.417 --> 18:37.583
-This is the repairman.
-At your service, ma'am.

18:37.667 --> 18:41.291
Okay, well, since you're here,
can you do me a favor?

18:41.917 --> 18:44.083
My boy's grades have been slipping.

18:44.166 --> 18:47.166
Could you, I don't know,
block all the sports channels?

18:47.250 --> 18:48.917
No, he can't do that--

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Oh, no, totally not a problem at all.
I can absolutely do that.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.208
In fact, I can also cut
the movie channels,

18:54.291 --> 18:56.750
because I am a real TV repairman.

18:56.834 --> 18:59.375
Hmm. Good idea. Thank you.

19:01.917 --> 19:03.291
Whew!

19:05.000 --> 19:06.500
Thanks a lot, man.

19:06.583 --> 19:09.875
Take away my TV
and my ability to help Ryan?

19:09.959 --> 19:13.500
Okay, bye-bye, All Sports Network.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.208
Oh, man!

19:15.583 --> 19:18.625
Uh-- You help Ryan plenty, Mark.

19:18.709 --> 19:19.917
He owes you a lot.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.250
I promised that Ryan
would end up with a nice family

19:22.333 --> 19:24.667
and I made sure the agency
picked yours. You know why?

19:24.750 --> 19:26.667
Yeah, because my mom and dad are awesome.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.083
Okay, bye-bye Action Movies HD!

19:29.166 --> 19:30.375
Dude!

19:32.542 --> 19:34.667
It wasn't just your parents, Mark.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.208
-It was you.
-What?

19:37.667 --> 19:39.250
-Me?
-Yeah.

19:39.333 --> 19:42.166
See, I knew Ryan was going to have
a tough life being a technopath,

19:42.250 --> 19:44.875
so he was gonna need
an older brother to look after him.

19:44.959 --> 19:47.667
But I was kind of a jerk
to Ryan growing up.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.875
Well, brothers fight.

19:49.959 --> 19:53.166
But when Ryan found the robot
and he needed a team,

19:53.250 --> 19:54.375
you stepped up.

19:54.458 --> 19:57.208
And now when the bot needs fixing,
you take care of it.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.041
And whenever Ryan is in trouble,

19:59.125 --> 20:01.250
you do whatever it takes
to get him out of it.

20:02.417 --> 20:05.041
Seems to me like you help him
more than, well...

20:05.792 --> 20:06.875
pretty much anyone.

20:07.792 --> 20:08.959
Thanks, Leo.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.291
That means a lot.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.166
Yeah.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.667
Maybe I could get
some of those channels back?

20:16.750 --> 20:19.125
-Oh, absolutely!
-Woo!

20:19.208 --> 20:22.041
Just as soon as your grades go back up.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.208
What?

20:26.917 --> 20:28.625
-Did we do that?
-No.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.834
No, that was something else.

20:30.917 --> 20:32.500
(door creaks open)

20:38.166 --> 20:39.625
Nice work, guys.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.667
We should probably get out of here.

20:42.750 --> 20:43.917
While you were down there

20:44.000 --> 20:46.041
I grabbed this screenshot
off the video feed.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.250
Thanks, man. That's-- that's awesome.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.333
-Shall we go see a giant cornflake?
-Yes!

20:59.417 --> 21:02.208
(alarm sounds)

21:02.291 --> 21:04.125
You've got to get back to Bay City!

21:04.208 --> 21:05.625
All right, we're on our way!

21:05.709 --> 21:07.166
We never get to do my thing.

21:19.333 --> 21:23.834
(sirens wail in distance)

21:23.917 --> 21:26.542
(Harris)
They city's power grid is out of control!

21:26.625 --> 21:28.208
What's going on?

21:42.166 --> 21:43.583
(phone dials)

21:44.458 --> 21:45.583
It's me, Randall.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.750
Yeah, I got the ore.

21:50.458 --> 21:51.834
But I got something else, too.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.333
I know how to track Leo down.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.917
Just go ahead with the plan.

21:59.667 --> 22:01.125
Get Leo.

22:03.125 --> 22:06.041
(theme music plays)
