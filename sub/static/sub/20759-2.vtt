WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:08.300
So that's the dormitory.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.844
Showers and flush toilets
are conveniently located

00:10.928 --> 00:12.512
in the men's shelter next door.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.849
This is so exciting!

00:15.933 --> 00:17.643
Can you believe I'm
finally going to college?

00:17.726 --> 00:21.438
I don't believe anything I
hear in the lame-stream media.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.232
The new semester starts
in a couple weeks,

00:23.315 --> 00:24.942
but I still don't know
where I want to go.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.109
This place seems great,

00:26.193 --> 00:27.361
but so did all the others.

00:27.444 --> 00:31.114
Famous Ray's Original
College, SUNY The Sewer.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.909
And Hudson University is on TV.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.118
How am I supposed to choose?

00:35.202 --> 00:36.245
Well, it depends.

00:36.328 --> 00:37.538
What do you want to study?

00:37.621 --> 00:39.873
I guess I never really
thought about it.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.000
Well, what kind of
job do you want?

00:42.084 --> 00:45.254
When I was little, I wanted to
be a professional horse-brusher,

00:45.337 --> 00:47.047
but that's all who you know.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.759
Okay, maybe work backwards.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.970
How do you want to die?

00:53.053 --> 00:56.431
Sucked into a machine?
Shot by a robber?

00:56.515 --> 00:59.351
Overestimate a tiger friendship?

00:59.434 --> 01:02.938
You should take one of these
career aptitude tests.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.440
I took one when I
was in high school.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.985
It said I should be
a unlicensed barber

01:08.068 --> 01:10.112
or a police informant.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.239
Look at me now. I'm both!

01:18.287 --> 01:19.538
Okay, Home Biscuit.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.665
Time to find out
what your dream is.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.500
Name...

01:23.584 --> 01:27.254
Dr. Vanessa Poseidon.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.799
The name you already have. Duh!

01:32.217 --> 01:33.302
Hey, Titus,

01:33.385 --> 01:34.469
want to take a free career test?

01:34.553 --> 01:35.595
No, thank you.

01:35.679 --> 01:38.056
I took one of those in high school,
and it told me to become a mannequin.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.516
Wow.

01:39.599 --> 01:43.937
That would be a good job for you, 'cause
you get so still when you're angry.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.356
No. Are you angry right now?

01:47.691 --> 01:49.443
Yes, I'm angry right now!

01:49.526 --> 01:53.488
Last night I saw Mikey going into
his apartment with another man!

01:53.572 --> 01:54.615
Really?

01:54.698 --> 01:55.741
Well, that doesn't
necessarily mean...

01:55.824 --> 01:57.993
He's cheating on me, Kim Kebow.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.829
They were laughing
and touching arms

02:00.912 --> 02:02.122
and worst of all...

02:02.205 --> 02:03.832
you're gonna need to
sit down for this.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.292
I know you're
sitting. Sit again.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.963
Mikey was wearing the date-night
outfit he wore on our first date.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.548
Whoa.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.258
Are you sure the
other guy was gay?

02:13.342 --> 02:15.552
Everybody's gay,
Kimmy. It's the '90s.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.471
Well, what did Mikey say when
you talked to him about it?

02:17.554 --> 02:18.972
I didn't talk to him. I bounced.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.475
I've been up all night
processing this in my own way.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.603
I will need all my
Afro-centric bedspreads.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.356
I need to pick samples.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.569
The definitive Rosie O'Donnell
cast recording of <i>Grease.</i>

02:33.195 --> 02:35.572
<i>Spooky Sounds of the
Haunted Mansion.</i>

02:36.907 --> 02:39.284
An audiotape of commercials
I use as a shopping list.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.828
You have to talk to Mikey and
give him a chance to explain.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.205
I know what I saw.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.998
Titus, Mikey's a good guy.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.124
Don't overreact.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.542
I'm not overreacting.

02:47.626 --> 02:50.587
I'm doing what any reasonable
person would do in this situation.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.715
I'm Lemonading.

03:32.587 --> 03:36.842

it's all on my shoulders.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.431

03:42.514 --> 03:43.515
No.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.772
a generous donation from
the Snyder Foundation

03:50.856 --> 03:53.817
to finally clean up this
blighted waterfront

03:53.900 --> 03:54.985
and to provide...

03:55.068 --> 03:56.361
Liar!

03:56.445 --> 03:59.114
Go back to the Upper East Side,

03:59.197 --> 04:01.992
you carpet-bagging
peroxided hooker!

04:02.075 --> 04:04.619
Now, look, this is exactly why

04:04.703 --> 04:07.122
I am running for
district council...

04:07.205 --> 04:09.958
to keep rich, white
A-holes like this

04:10.041 --> 04:11.585
from coming to our neighborhood

04:11.668 --> 04:14.755
and "fixing" it so that
real New Yorkers like us

04:14.838 --> 04:17.466
cannot afford to
live here no more.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.675
No, that's not what we're...

04:18.759 --> 04:22.012
And as your councilwoman,
you can count on me

04:22.095 --> 04:24.514
to vote no on this cleanup.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.891
Lock her up!

04:25.974 --> 04:28.477
Lock her up! Lock her up!

04:28.560 --> 04:31.229
Bye-bye, sweetie. It's
so good to see you.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.106

04:54.044 --> 04:55.378

Creative thinking."

04:57.881 --> 05:01.802

a penguin with teeth!

05:03.595 --> 05:05.472

05:05.555 --> 05:08.225
"Girl, you know standardized
tests are racist!"

05:08.308 --> 05:10.727

Maybe.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.047
Okay.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.008
"Prefers working outside,
salary flexible,

08:07.696 --> 08:08.780
That's even better.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.535
Stop. Yep.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.828
Watch out!

08:15.620 --> 08:16.705
Just a minute.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.456
Good morning! How are you?

08:18.540 --> 08:20.625
Yeah!

08:20.709 --> 08:22.377
I'm going to school for
crossing guarding!

08:23.003 --> 08:26.464
Hey.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.091
What the hell, Lillian?

08:28.174 --> 08:31.386
I haven't been spoken to that way since
that time I went to the post office.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.764
I'm sorry, dear.
It's just politics.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.974
I thought you were my friend.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.642
I am your friend.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.562
But if I'm gonna get stuff
done for this neighborhood,

08:40.645 --> 08:42.438
it's prison rules, baby.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.481
Get stuff done?

08:43.565 --> 08:46.151
You're just preventing these
people from getting clean water.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.737
Do you really think that's
what the voters want?

08:48.820 --> 08:50.030
Let's ask 'em.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.115
Hey, Meth-Head Charlie.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.992
Gonna vote for me tomorrow?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.618
Of course. Wait.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.537
Did you say "vote"
or "smoke meth"?

08:57.620 --> 08:59.706
- Vote.
- Then, no, I can't.

08:59.789 --> 09:00.874
I'm a felon.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.460
What about you, Creep?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.879
Sex offender. Big-time.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.006
Pervert Rick?

09:08.089 --> 09:09.424
Canadian.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.886
Hey, wait a minute.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.096
I'm a felon, too.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.557
Payola.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.685
This neighborhood's just
a basket of deplorables.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.897
And Titus won't register to vote

09:23.980 --> 09:26.441
because he refuses
to do jury duty.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.526
He says he has no peers.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.278
So who can vote tomorrow?

09:34.032 --> 09:35.450
Only one person?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.285
You got to be kidding me!

09:37.368 --> 09:38.453
Kimmy!

09:38.536 --> 09:40.997
I got to get that dumb
ginger to vote for...

09:41.081 --> 09:43.083
- Anyone but you.
- Me.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.545
I thought the cruise wasn't
over for another two months.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.506
- I thought you were my boyfriend.
- I am.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.592
It's, like, all I talk about.
"My boyfriend's on a cruise."

09:52.675 --> 09:54.010
"My boyfriend's a great singer."

09:54.094 --> 09:56.262
"Hey, that pug dog looks
just like my boyfriend."

09:56.346 --> 09:58.473
I came by your house last
night after I turned down

09:58.556 --> 10:00.183
a three-way with a puppet...
you're welcome...

10:00.266 --> 10:02.936
only to find you
laughing with some boy

10:03.019 --> 10:05.230
like two white ladies
looking at a salad!

10:05.313 --> 10:06.272
You were spying on me?

10:06.356 --> 10:08.191
I was surprising you!

10:08.274 --> 10:09.943
You made it spying
by being shady.

10:10.026 --> 10:10.985
You know what?

10:11.069 --> 10:13.029
I can't with you right now.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.531
You better call "Bucky
With The Good Hair."

10:15.990 --> 10:16.991
You mean Jeff?

10:17.075 --> 10:18.827
Jeff?

10:18.910 --> 10:21.746
What kind of name is Jeff? Ew.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.123
Jeff is just a friend.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.958
Stop saying it like
it's a normal name.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.543
And if he was just a friend,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.795
why did you draw the shades
when you went inside the house?

10:28.878 --> 10:30.463
So we could see the TV.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.090
He came over to
play <i>Call of Duty.</i>

10:32.173 --> 10:35.176
Okay, but also, no.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.763
And if Jorpf, or whatever
he calls himself,

10:38.847 --> 10:41.349
was just a friend, why were you
wearing your date-night clothes?

10:41.432 --> 10:42.725
What?

10:44.144 --> 10:47.689
That blue sweater I put on you in
episode 204 of our relationship.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.607
I don't know. It was
all I had clean.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.693
"I don't know. It was
all I had clean."

10:55.029 --> 10:57.365
As I was about to sing
in my next song...

10:58.241 --> 11:00.368
Boom, boy, bye, foop.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.872
<i>♪ Boom, boy, bye, foop ♪</i>

11:06.499 --> 11:07.709
What?

11:10.253 --> 11:12.505
Come here, Kimmy. Come to me!

11:12.589 --> 11:14.132
No, no, no, over here, dear.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.218
- Come on, come to Lillian.
- Here, girl. Here, girl!

11:17.302 --> 11:18.803
Come on! Come on, girl!

11:18.887 --> 11:20.972
Num, num, num, num.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.223
Come on, girl.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.183
Lillian, we agreed no bacon.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.977
Okay, now listen.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.688
You're gonna vote for me
tomorrow, aren't you, dear?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.273
- Of course!
- But if you vote for her,

11:30.356 --> 11:33.067
she's gonna stop me from bringing
clean water to this neighborhood.

11:33.151 --> 11:33.985
Really?

11:34.068 --> 11:36.029
That's why you need to vote for
any candidate but Lillian.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.363
No!

11:39.115 --> 11:41.659
If this yuppie bitch and
her yuppie boyfriend

11:41.743 --> 11:45.330
clean up the sludgefront,
more yuppies will move in.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.624
And you know what yuppies eat?

11:47.707 --> 11:50.043
- Brussels sprouts...
- Yuck!

11:50.126 --> 11:52.086
and ice cream that
tastes like lavender.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.463
No, that's a smell!

11:53.546 --> 11:56.299
But you'll have the most
beautiful new waterfront...

11:56.382 --> 11:58.343
with ducks in it,

11:58.426 --> 12:00.511
ducks that have babies.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.306
- Aww. How many?
- It doesn't matter!

12:03.389 --> 12:05.683
Our rent will be
jacked up so high,

12:05.767 --> 12:08.186
we'll probably have to
move to Hart Island,

12:08.269 --> 12:11.314
where they bury all
the unclaimed bodies.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.899
Now, I forget.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.986
Do you like sleeping in a
giant pit full of skeletons?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.655
You know I don't!

12:34.545 --> 12:36.130
Good morning, everyone.

12:36.214 --> 12:39.926
Just FYI, this tour is only
for prospective students.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.761
So, if you're here for
the Al-Anon meeting,

12:41.844 --> 12:43.179
that's downstairs.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.598
And if you're here

12:45.682 --> 12:48.643
for what you should know is an
unauthorized and very incorrect

12:48.726 --> 12:51.062
<i>Sex and the City</i> walking
tour, that starts at 2:00.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.401
Okay, great.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.403
Hi. My name's Perry.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.988
And if you have any questions...

13:00.071 --> 13:02.365
Yes. I didn't see
anything in the pamphlet

13:02.448 --> 13:03.992
about your crossing
guard program.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.577
Do the professors here have
real-world crossing guard experience?

13:06.661 --> 13:08.329
Or are they these
ivory-tower types

13:08.413 --> 13:10.081
who've never crossed a
street in their lives?

13:10.164 --> 13:12.417
I-I don't think we have a
crossing guard program.

13:13.001 --> 13:16.045
But we have a lot of other
great vocational programs.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.382
TV/VCR Repair, Sandwich
Arts, Murder for Hire.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.427
Yeah, I'm on a pretty
serious career track here.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.430
I took a test, and it said I was
gonna be a crossing guard, so...

13:25.513 --> 13:26.639
Well, that's awesome.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.350
But you never know. You
might surprise yourself.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.352
I originally came here
to study accounting,

13:31.436 --> 13:34.063
and then I got really
interested in philosophy.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.191
Philosophy? Like what is the
sound of one hand clapping?

13:37.275 --> 13:39.277
So stupid. It's this.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.862
Kshew! Kshew!

13:41.946 --> 13:43.990
I make that sound a lot 'cause
no one will high-five me.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.909
Sure, but philosophy's
so much more than that.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.870
It teaches you how
to really think.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.873
Right. Right.
Penguin with teeth.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.291
Like, okay, so...

13:53.374 --> 13:56.085
how do you know you're
even here right now?

13:57.920 --> 13:59.130
See?

13:59.213 --> 14:03.176
Okay, but what if you're
really just a brain

14:03.259 --> 14:05.261
in a vat somewhere in a lab

14:05.344 --> 14:08.431
and that was just a bunch
of electrical signals

14:08.514 --> 14:10.558
to make you think you
pinched yourself?

14:10.641 --> 14:11.893
Whoa.

14:11.976 --> 14:15.104
This is making my head all tingly, like
that time I put Pop Rocks on a Q-tip.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.272
I know, right?

14:16.355 --> 14:20.568
My vat brain is telling my
imaginary arm to high-five!

14:24.530 --> 14:26.616
I'm sorry. I get a
little carried away.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.076
Should we continue
with the tour?

14:28.159 --> 14:30.328
I don't know. <i>Is </i> there a tour?

14:30.411 --> 14:33.039
Is this building even here?

14:37.668 --> 14:41.756
<i>What will you say at my funeral
now that you've killed me?</i>

14:41.839 --> 14:45.134
<i>Here lies Titus,

14:45.218 --> 14:47.470
<i>both living and dead.</i>

14:48.888 --> 14:53.434

<i>Ashes to ashes. Dust to...</i>

Kimberly, use your

15:18.334 --> 15:19.460
You're not answering your phone.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.045
If you must know,

15:21.129 --> 15:23.631
I dropped it in a public pool
while I was making track one.

15:23.714 --> 15:27.093
Like my heart, it's over there in a
plastic bag full of rice, drying out.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.096
Titus, I know you
don't believe me,

15:30.179 --> 15:31.848
but Jeff and me are not
doing anything bad.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.724
Who?

15:33.808 --> 15:36.936
Okay, I know I'm not a
great singer like you...

15:37.019 --> 15:41.065
If this is a murder/suicide,
please leave a note.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.005
I swear, babe, on my Pupazza's
Ping-Pong ball eyes,

16:04.088 --> 16:05.548
Jeff is just a buddy.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.758
- We met at the gym.
- The gayest place to meet someone!

16:07.842 --> 16:10.052
Titus, you were away for
months on that cruise.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.846
Was I not supposed
to have any friends?

16:11.929 --> 16:14.599
I didn't. I had nothing but
enemies, because I love you.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.641
I love you, too.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.727
- So why won't you believe me?
- Because!

16:17.810 --> 16:19.896
Two gay men can't
<i>just</i> be friends,

16:19.979 --> 16:22.523
just like a straight woman and a
straight man can't be friends.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.358
Also, women and other women.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.944
Well, let me prove you wrong.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.738
Jeff and I are supposed to go
to the batting cages today.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.740
Just come with us.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.699
Please.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.577
I do own a baseball stick now.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.085
Refrigerator? Seriously?

16:43.169 --> 16:46.005
Yep, it was the '80s, and my
mom really loved the Bears.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.466
But that's why I go by
my middle name, Perry.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.177
In Indiana, I used to babysit a
little girl named Detlef Schrempf.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.261
Yeah.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.222
So...

16:54.305 --> 16:56.641
this is my mom and dad,

16:56.724 --> 16:59.143
and those are my sisters,
Payton and Ditka.

16:59.227 --> 17:02.271
My dad was a security guard at
the Tootsie Roll factory...

17:02.355 --> 17:03.189
That's awesome!

17:03.272 --> 17:04.565
till he got shot by robbers...

17:04.648 --> 17:06.358
ful. That's awful.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.194
fell over a railing and got sucked
into a chocolate-mixing machine.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.655
No.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.740
Still a little bit awesome.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.909
After that, it was up to me
to take care of the family.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.702
That's why I'm just
going to school now.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.829
I'm sorry. That stinks on ice.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.373
But you can't control the world.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.583
You can only control how you
choose to respond to it.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.419
It's part of why I
got into philosophy.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.714
What does it mean to be a good person,
and how do you make those choices?

17:28.798 --> 17:31.425
Maybe philosophy can help me.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.803
My friends want me to make a
choice, and it's impossible.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.556
They both seem equally good or bad,
and I'm just stuck in the middle.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.516
Like Buridan's Ass.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.767
It's a parable about free will.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.519
- So, if a perfectly rational donkey...
- That's me!

17:41.602 --> 17:44.480
gets placed between two
identical bales of hay,

17:44.564 --> 17:46.941
the donkey won't be able to
choose one over the other,

17:47.024 --> 17:48.234
and so it will starve to death.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.652
That's perfect.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.612
I can just starve to death,
and I won't have to choose.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.531
But, well, according to Spinoza,

17:53.614 --> 17:55.283
the donkey isn't
actually rational

17:55.366 --> 17:57.910
because making a choice
is a good in itself.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.205
Okay, so sometimes the
donkey's just got to choose

18:01.289 --> 18:02.915
which pizza it's gonna eat.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.251
In my head, I changed it
to pizza. Can I do that?

18:05.334 --> 18:06.794
Sure, it's all just a
thought experiment.

18:06.877 --> 18:07.920
It doesn't even have
to be a donkey.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.214
It could be a
unicorn, if you want.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.304
It's time for this unicorn
to choose a cupcake.

18:16.387 --> 18:17.471
I changed it again.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.687
Come on!

18:24.770 --> 18:26.397
You're swinging down, jackass.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.108
You got to loosen
up that stance?

18:30.901 --> 18:32.361
You play baseball
like Michael Jordan.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.239
And you play basketball
like John Kruk!

18:35.323 --> 18:37.199
I met Michael Jordan
at a party once,

18:37.283 --> 18:39.118
but then it turned out to
be a cardboard cutout.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.411
Also, it wasn't a party.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.748
It was a McDonald's PlayPlace where
I was hiding from some teenagers.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.042
Bro, you're killing me.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.169
You got to get your weight
off your back foot.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.299
Yeah! That's what
I'm talkin' about!

18:55.426 --> 18:57.219
All right, show me
what you got, Yuko.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.221
Voice evaluation complete.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.224
Setting pitching style
for "Basic Dudebro."

19:02.308 --> 19:03.809
Yeah, you know it!

19:03.893 --> 19:05.853
- Told you he was in love with you.
- What?

19:05.936 --> 19:07.146
What movie were you watching?

19:07.229 --> 19:08.356
<i>Glitter, </i> on my phone.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.066
But I saw the way that
boy was looking at you.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.151
That's crazy. This is
just friend stuff.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.944
Are you serious right now?

19:14.028 --> 19:15.571
My Lord.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.948
Mikey, I have always
loved your naïveté,

19:18.032 --> 19:19.825
but don't make me
spell it out for you,

19:19.909 --> 19:22.662
because my French teacher
was named Madame Scruggs.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.997
Titus, Jeff has never hit on me.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.832
This is all in your own head.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.168
Don't do this to us. Don't
do this to yourself.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.921
I'm just saying,
at some point...

19:32.004 --> 19:34.840
Jooff is going to make his move,

19:34.924 --> 19:36.467
and you're gonna come
running back to me,

19:36.550 --> 19:38.302
saying, "Titus, you were right.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.137
Also, your skin looks
amazing today."

19:40.221 --> 19:41.764
You're killing me, pal.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.974
So now the ball's in your court.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.602
See, I know baseball.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.232
Finally.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.025
How do you even know that guy?

19:53.109 --> 19:55.611
What do you mean
how do I know him?

19:55.695 --> 19:58.030
No. Wow.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.198
Brother.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.825
Voice evaluation complete.

20:00.908 --> 20:04.286
Setting pitching style
for "Tony Danza."

20:11.127 --> 20:13.003
What's got two hands, two feet,

20:13.087 --> 20:15.131
and is amazing at
making choices?

20:16.132 --> 20:18.008
This gal! I voted!

20:18.092 --> 20:21.095
And by the way, Lillian, you
were wrong about college.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.724
I realized today that it's not
just about how I want to die.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.434
It's about how I want to live.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.812
I don't just want to
be a crossing guard.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.397
I want to learn how
to really think.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.232
Just tell us who you voted for.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.610
- Well, it's a classic Buridan's Ass.
- Thank you.

20:36.694 --> 20:39.363
I don't know which one of you
is right about the sludgefront,

20:39.447 --> 20:41.907
but Spinoza said I had
to make a choice.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.869
Spin-Noza? The Sephardic DJ?

20:44.952 --> 20:46.036
Maybe.

20:46.120 --> 20:50.499
And in the end, I trust Lillian to do
what's right for this neighborhood.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.042
It's a mandate!

20:52.126 --> 20:53.961
One hundred percent of the vote!

20:54.044 --> 20:57.631
Okay, day one of the
Kaushtupper regime...

20:57.715 --> 21:00.634
get rid of the carriage
horses in Central Park.

21:00.718 --> 21:04.138
Day two, carriage-horse
stew for all!

21:05.848 --> 21:07.767
I'm just hopeless without Russ.

21:07.850 --> 21:11.896
God, I miss the smell
of his one dead tooth

21:11.979 --> 21:14.607
and how it squishes under
my tongue when we kiss.

21:14.690 --> 21:15.566
Blech.

21:15.649 --> 21:19.153
Honey, you're not a dum-dum.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.781
I'm just the baddest
bitch in the game.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.449
Come on.

21:23.532 --> 21:27.453
I'm gonna let you buy me
a congratulations steak.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.706
And, Kimmy, you are not
gonna regret this.

21:30.790 --> 21:36.086
I'm gonna show those fat-cat
politicians who's boss!

21:36.170 --> 21:37.838
Attica! Attica!

21:37.922 --> 21:41.717
- <i>Gattaca! Gattaca! Gattaca!</i>
- Attica! Attica! Attica!

21:41.801 --> 21:44.178
<i>Gattaca! Gattaca!</i>

21:44.261 --> 21:45.638
That was fun.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.021
Titus, you were right.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.356
And also?

21:55.439 --> 21:57.149
Your skin actually does
look amazing today,

21:57.233 --> 21:58.567
so I don't mind saying it.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.277
How did he do it?

22:00.361 --> 22:03.239
Did he give you a single rose
with a teddy bear clipped to it?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.533
Did he hide a ring
in a patty melt?

22:05.616 --> 22:07.827
He tried to fight me, and
then halfway through...

22:07.910 --> 22:09.829
- Classic!
- It doesn't matter, though.

22:09.912 --> 22:12.373
I realized this is all my fault.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.999
Titus, I never told
him we were together.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.086
Why didn't I do that?
I tell everybody.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.338
And why did I wear my date-night
outfit? What's wrong with me?

22:19.421 --> 22:22.508
I mean, it never even occurred to me that
you could play video games with a guy

22:22.591 --> 22:25.302
and watch sports with him and,
like, touch butts and stuff,

22:25.386 --> 22:29.306
all in one guy, like some kind
of sexy Swiss Army knife.

22:29.390 --> 22:30.474
That's crazy, right?

22:30.558 --> 22:32.268
I mean, that could be too
much of a good thing.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.477
You must be confusing me

22:33.561 --> 22:34.937
with one of those <i>Sex
and the City</i> creatures.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.355
This is not brunch.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.191
I am not the one to help you
decide between Mr. Big and Hormf.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.985
No, dude, I choose you.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.570
I'll be your pet.

22:42.653 --> 22:43.988
I'll do whatever you want.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.198
I'll go wherever you want, and
we'll be together forever.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.577
No! I choose you!

22:49.660 --> 22:51.704
I'll be your pet. I'll
go wherever you want.

22:51.787 --> 22:54.415
I'll do whatever you want, and
we'll be together forever.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.042
I don't want to lose you. Please,
you're the only one for me.

23:00.754 --> 23:01.922
Come on.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.924
There's someone
you need to meet.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.889
Perry, I'm doing it.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.558
I'm applying to
Robert Moses College.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.934
That's fantastic.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.020
You know, they call it
the Harvert of Queens.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.146
Did you say "Harvert"?

23:18.188 --> 23:20.274
In a few weeks, we'll
be philosophy buddies.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.985
I can't wait to meet all
the other "studes."

23:23.068 --> 23:24.403
Students.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.322
Well, I won't be here.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.782
I'm transferring to
Columbia next semester.

23:28.866 --> 23:31.327
Columbia House? Like the tapes?

23:31.410 --> 23:32.911
Columbia University.

23:32.995 --> 23:36.624
After busting my ass here for two
years, I qualified for a scholarship.

23:36.707 --> 23:37.916
How cool is that?

23:39.126 --> 23:39.960
Wait.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.670
Is Columbia better than here?

23:41.754 --> 23:43.589
Yeah, a little bit.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.092
Yeah, it is.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.303
I mean, Robert Moses is great,

23:49.386 --> 23:52.389
but people come from all over
the world to go to Columbia.

23:52.473 --> 23:55.142
Like Epcot or Mall of America.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.603
You get into a place like Columbia,
the world is your oyster.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.772
Ew, I hope you're
changing it to...

23:59.855 --> 24:01.065
Pizza, in my mind.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.524
Yeah, I am.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.859
Wow.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.778
I'm really happy for you.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.697
Stay cool, Refrigerator.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.287
Look, Kimmy, I know you
took a test or whatever,

24:15.371 --> 24:17.956
but you don't have to
be a crossing guard.

24:18.040 --> 24:21.126
You could be a...
unicorn, if you want.

24:31.970 --> 24:32.930
Whoops.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.519
Okay, first item...

24:38.602 --> 24:41.355
accepting the Snyder
Foundation's matching funds

24:41.438 --> 24:43.440
for the sludge cleanup.

24:43.524 --> 24:46.276
Over my hot body.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.446
As councilwoman for
East Dogmouth,

24:49.530 --> 24:52.241
I say, "Hell, nay."

24:53.242 --> 24:54.576
All those in favor?

24:54.660 --> 24:56.829
Aye. The measure passes.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.288
Moving on.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.541
Two fire hydrants were
recently destroyed

25:00.624 --> 25:03.502
by a bat-wielding man
in a yellow cape.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.003
Wha...

25:12.052 --> 25:13.262
What are we doing here?
Who are we meeting?

25:13.345 --> 25:14.555
And why wouldn't you
tell me in the truck?

25:14.638 --> 25:15.931
For drama, fool.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.183
Titus!

25:18.767 --> 25:20.811
What an unexpected pleasure.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.271
Tim! Tim, come here.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.440
I want you to meet an
old friend of mine.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.775
- This is Titus.
- Hi!

25:26.859 --> 25:29.153
Roger, this is my
boyfriend, Mikey.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.113
Mikey, so nice to meet you.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.490
And that is the "tooth"!

25:36.410 --> 25:39.246
Orthodontist humor. Sorry.
He can't help himself.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.957
Roger was my first
real boyfriend.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.083
True, true.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.169
We met when I ran that free
dentistry van in Hell's Kitchen.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.546
Bless your heart, you banged
everything that moved back then.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.007
What a treat!

25:50.090 --> 25:51.550
Could you guys stay for dinner?

25:51.633 --> 25:54.970
Tim made zoodles. It is
going to be "filling"!

25:57.473 --> 25:59.975
I can, Roger, but Mikey
has somewhere to be.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.477
I'll be right in.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.020
Okay.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.398
Where am I going? I could eat.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.192
Look around here, Mikey.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.819
Sweaters, dentist jokes,

26:10.903 --> 26:12.404
a bird pool.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.281
Can you imagine me living here?

26:14.364 --> 26:15.407
Of course not.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.076
Well, this is the life I was willing
to lead to stay with Roger,

26:18.160 --> 26:19.578
because he was my first,

26:19.661 --> 26:22.664
and I was so sure he was
the only one for me.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.375
And if he hadn't set
me free to find out,

26:25.459 --> 26:26.835
I would have never met you.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.462
Wait, what are you saying?

26:28.545 --> 26:31.423
You made me go to work on that cruise,
even though it was hard for you.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.342
And it went amazing, and
I didn't eat anyone.

26:34.885 --> 26:37.429
- And now I need to do the same for you.
- No.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.765
It's too much pressure

26:39.848 --> 26:42.810
being your first
and your only...

26:42.893 --> 26:44.645
even for a glorious
diva such as "moy."

26:44.728 --> 26:47.147
- You mean "moi"?
- Damn you, Madame Scruggs!

26:47.231 --> 26:48.690
Wait.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.234
Are you breaking up with me?

26:50.317 --> 26:54.029
It's just one of the many small ways
in which I am stronger than Beyoncé.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.864
We can't see each other at all?

26:55.948 --> 26:57.241
For now.

26:59.660 --> 27:03.622
And if we're meant to be
together, then blah, blah, blah.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.459

it was Biz Markie.
