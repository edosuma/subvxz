WEBVTT

00:10.260 --> 00:12.970
Abby, wait.
You don't know the whole story.

00:13.721 --> 00:16.933
-Heather's gettin' a 'bortion.
-It doesn't make it better.

00:17.058 --> 00:18.685
You have to listen to me.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.812
-Abby--
-I don't have to fuckin' listen to you!

00:20.895 --> 00:22.730
I don't have to talk to you!

00:22.814 --> 00:23.898
I just want to leave!

00:24.024 --> 00:25.233
[breathing heavily]

00:25.317 --> 00:27.735
-Come on, Abby, I love you!
-[engine starting]

00:27.819 --> 00:28.945
Abby!

00:33.575 --> 00:34.659
Colt?

00:36.536 --> 00:37.495
You all right?

00:40.998 --> 00:42.625
Yeah, I'll be fine.

00:44.252 --> 00:49.091
Uh, you probably don't want to hear this,
but we're startin' work in 45 minutes.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.805
[theme song playing]

01:57.575 --> 02:01.538
Sorry, rat, you fucked with
the wrong man's Cocoa Puffs.

02:03.831 --> 02:04.874
[shudders]

02:06.376 --> 02:07.377
[exhales sharply]

02:08.378 --> 02:10.547
Hey, you just hit me with a fuckin' rat!

02:12.006 --> 02:13.800
I did? [chuckles]

02:13.883 --> 02:16.219
Even when I'm not tryin',
I got a better arm than you.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.971
Whatcha doin' out here?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.015
Saw smoke...

02:21.974 --> 02:24.394
thought some creepy pervert
was stayin' out here.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.603
I was right.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.816
Yeah, this place is mine now.
Mom's lettin' me live out here.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.985
What? She got you a job, and now
she's lettin' you live in the cabin?

02:33.903 --> 02:36.156
She won't even give me
her Netflix password.

02:38.866 --> 02:40.785
Well, if you had two kids
and only loved one of 'em,

02:40.868 --> 02:41.911
isn't that what you'd do?

02:41.994 --> 02:44.956
[sighs] Look at this place.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.917
Used to be fuckin' awesome.
Now it's a mess.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.378
Yeah, it's like the house version of you.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.799
Oh, check it out. Still see where
we carved our names up in the beam.

02:54.882 --> 02:56.301
Hmm, yeah, check it out.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.053
Here's the belt Dad used on us
when we carved our names in the beam.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.267
I don't remember you carvin' "sucks"
underneath my name.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.518
Added that today.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.313
You want a beer?

03:08.396 --> 03:09.731
Yeah, what the hell.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.608
[Rooster sighs]

03:11.691 --> 03:12.734
Thank you.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.529
-It's warm.
-Fridge is broke.

03:16.613 --> 03:20.367
But hey, just 'cause the mountains aren't
blue don't mean you can't go skiin'.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.826
[Colt sighing]

03:27.039 --> 03:28.666
[Rooster sighs and sniffles]

03:28.750 --> 03:31.753
-Told Abby about Heather.
-What? Why?

03:32.795 --> 03:34.922
I want our relationship built on honesty.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.049
What? Why?

03:38.134 --> 03:39.427
'Cause I don't wanna end up alone,

03:39.511 --> 03:41.763
livin' in my mommy's cabin,
throwin' rats at people.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.974
What? Why?

03:46.643 --> 03:47.977
Well, how'd she take it?

03:49.979 --> 03:50.980
Not good.

03:51.689 --> 03:56.944
Sent her texts... flowers...
left her, like, three voicemails.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.031
Nothin'.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.325
-[gun cocks]
-Who the fuck's in here?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.993
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
-Whoa, whoa, Dad...

04:04.744 --> 04:06.496
just me, all right?
You don't need a shotgun.

04:07.079 --> 04:08.373
We'll see about that.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.168
-What are you doin' here?
-Well, I'm livin' here now.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.795
Like hell you are.

04:15.087 --> 04:16.964
Guess we know who Daddy's favorite is.
[chuckles]

04:17.549 --> 04:18.758
Want your belt, Daddy?

04:20.385 --> 04:23.012
What I want is for you
to get out of my huntin' cabin.

04:25.139 --> 04:26.641
Well, that's the thing, Dad.

04:26.724 --> 04:29.727
It's not your huntin' cabin anymore,
it's Mom's.

04:29.811 --> 04:34.106
So if anybody's gettin' out of here,
it's gonna be you, neighbor.

04:36.108 --> 04:37.151
[Colt] Okay.

04:37.234 --> 04:42.449
Look, why don't you both just agree
to stay out of each other's way?

04:43.074 --> 04:44.075
It's fine by me.

04:45.785 --> 04:46.994
Just to be clear...

04:48.037 --> 04:50.832
we stay off of each other's property,
no matter what?

04:51.749 --> 04:53.960
-That's right.
-Good.

04:54.043 --> 04:57.464
You just got a check
from Neumann's Hill yesterday.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.382
I'm gonna use it to start a fire.

05:05.513 --> 05:09.642
Look at you runnin' a ranch.
I remember when you was a boy in diapers

05:09.726 --> 05:13.062
followin' your dad around
with a bottle in your hand. [chuckles]

05:13.145 --> 05:15.022
Well, gotta grow up sometime.

05:16.273 --> 05:18.192
You ain't wearin' a diaper, are you?

05:19.026 --> 05:20.362
Not right now.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.655
I did wear one to a Rockies game one time.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.616
Made it 17 innings, never got up once.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.954
Well, what about that other deal?
You and your dad got that figured out?

05:31.080 --> 05:34.834
Yeah. We figured out how to say "fuck you"
in Morse code with our porch lights.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.629
Well, you know your dad.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.256
The more he bitches about somethin',
the more he cares about it.

05:40.339 --> 05:45.219
Oh, well... then he must
really love gun control, salads, and cats.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.849
-Hey, fellas.
-Hey, can I help you?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.101
I'm Rich Baker.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.605
Okay.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.607
The quality control guy
from Neumann's Hill?

05:57.690 --> 05:59.108
I sent you a bunch of e-mails.

05:59.191 --> 06:03.613
Huh. I... I don't think I got anything.
You sure you got my right e-mail?

06:03.696 --> 06:08.701
Oh, is it, badassrooster6969@yahoo?

06:10.202 --> 06:11.370
Huh, that's it.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.706
Must've went to my spam.

06:14.290 --> 06:17.293
Well, nice to meet you, Rich.
You know Dale Rivers? He's our vet.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.629
Nice to meet you, Dale.
I heard a lot of great things about you.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.713
Nice to meet you, Rich.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.800
Pardon the warmth of the hand,
it's been up a heifer's heiny.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.593
Oh, were you checkin' out the herd?

06:25.677 --> 06:29.221
-No. No, cow is just a friend.
-[both chuckle]

06:29.305 --> 06:32.308
-Little vet humor for ya.
-[both chuckle]

06:32.391 --> 06:34.894
-That is some folksy shit, right there!
-[both laugh]

06:36.854 --> 06:38.440
You mind if I talk to, uh, Rooster
for a second?

06:38.523 --> 06:43.194
Oh, no. No, I'm takin' Charlene over
to the Indian casino to see the Judds.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.613
Oh, well,
I think it's a tribute band, Dale.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.281
Ah, well...

06:47.364 --> 06:51.035
neither one of us can hear or see
worth a shit anymore, so it don't matter.

06:51.118 --> 06:52.620
[Rich chuckles]

06:52.704 --> 06:54.872
-See you, fellas.
-Later on, Dale.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.249
That's a good guy, right there.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.085
Yeah, like I said,
I've heard a lot of great things.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.170
-Is that a beer?
-Huh?

07:02.839 --> 07:04.966
Oh, hey, Dale, you left your beer here!

07:05.049 --> 07:06.968
[scoffs] That's weird.

07:08.595 --> 07:13.558
[stammers] Have we met before?
Because... you look very familiar.

07:13.641 --> 07:17.103
Yeah, my family transferred to Garrison
my senior year.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.855
I think you were a freshman.

07:19.897 --> 07:23.275
You probably remember me as,
you know, the only black guy.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.028
-Oh, shit, Rich!
-[laughs]

07:26.112 --> 07:27.154
What's up, dude?

07:27.238 --> 07:28.740
Man, what happened to you
after high school?

07:28.823 --> 07:30.492
-You just, like, disappeared.
-I went to college.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.951
[laughing] Lame.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.246
-No, I'm just kiddin'. Just kiddin'.
-Yeah.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.790
Hey, uh, so what's up
with this quality control thing?

07:37.874 --> 07:39.041
Are you, like, my boss or somethin'?

07:39.125 --> 07:40.835
No, no, no, no.
You're the boss.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.670
I'm just here to make sure
you got everything you need.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.464
-Mmm.
-For example...

07:44.547 --> 07:45.590
if you need, I don't know, a pen

07:45.673 --> 07:47.759
to fill out those inventory reports
I haven't gotten yet.

07:49.426 --> 07:52.179
Yeah. Oh, yeah,
I've been meanin' to get to those.

07:52.263 --> 07:55.057
Hey, did you fuck Tracy Jenkins
back in high school?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.769
Rooster, I'm really gonna
need those reports.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.688
And yes... yes, I did.

08:00.772 --> 08:04.984
-[laughs] Man, that is fuckin' awesome.
-[chuckles]

08:08.112 --> 08:09.781
Damn it, Dale, you know?

08:11.616 --> 08:12.700
[sighs]

08:12.784 --> 08:15.161
And speaking of Dale,
you're not gonna be able to hire him,

08:15.244 --> 08:17.288
'cause he's not
on our approved list of vets.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.332
-What? No one told me that.
-I did. I e-mailed it to you.

08:20.416 --> 08:23.419
[stammers] The subject of the e-mail was,
"Vets you can and cannot hire."

08:24.712 --> 08:27.465
Yeah, about that, um...
you know, they hired me here

08:27.548 --> 08:29.425
to run this ranch
'cause they trust my judgment.

08:29.509 --> 08:33.054
Now, I've worked with Dale my entire life,
and he's the best vet in the state.

08:33.137 --> 08:36.057
So... I'm gonna hire him here.

08:37.266 --> 08:41.312
Hey, man, if you feel that strongly
about it, I say good for you. Go for it.

08:42.229 --> 08:43.314
All right, cool, thanks.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.982
Yeah, thing is,
Neumann's Hill's not gonna pay for it,

08:45.066 --> 08:46.693
so that's comin' out of your pocket.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.740
Well, maybe I could just take a look
at the rest of these vets on here.

08:57.119 --> 09:02.750
All right, Daddy-o, I got spinach,
artichoke and chicken panini,

09:03.585 --> 09:06.921
or Thai-style chicken spring rolls.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.506
I want that steak you burned up.

09:12.677 --> 09:16.764
Yeah, sorry about that.
My mind's kind of been all over the place.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.141
I take it you haven't heard from Abby.

09:19.726 --> 09:23.270
No. She made it pretty clear
she wants her space.

09:24.939 --> 09:28.985
I thought I made the same thing
pretty clear to you, but here you are.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.364
Yeah, I don't know what to do.

09:34.490 --> 09:37.034
Well, you certainly
don't want to cook her a steak.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.537
She'll come around.

09:40.622 --> 09:43.540
Yeah, I don't know if she will.
She's really pissed.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.837
What if it's over?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.132
What if I can't get her back?

09:53.635 --> 09:54.802
You know what?

09:56.053 --> 09:57.805
I'll take the spring roll.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.183
[knocking at door]

10:02.602 --> 10:04.145
-Hey.
-[Colt] Hey.

10:05.354 --> 10:06.355
Can we talk?

10:07.314 --> 10:08.482
Yeah.

10:08.565 --> 10:09.817
You got a lot of nerve,

10:09.901 --> 10:13.112
tellin' Rooster he could live in the cabin
without talkin' to me.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.489
Beau, that is my cabin now.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.160
I have no obligation to tell you anything.
We're divorced.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.496
By the way, nice haircut.
Who did it?

10:22.579 --> 10:25.499
I have no obligation to tell you anything.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.296
-We're divorced.
-How's Brenda?

10:30.379 --> 10:31.798
Oh, shit!

10:36.177 --> 10:39.639
She gave me a great haircut.
Want to see the back?

10:44.476 --> 10:45.728
I need a whiskey.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.064
Oh, hey, comin' right up.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.316
[chuckles] Look at this...

10:51.192 --> 10:53.610
me pourin' a drink for you. [chuckles]

10:53.695 --> 10:56.488
-Here you go.
-So, I was talkin' to Heather today--

10:56.572 --> 10:57.949
Okay. [grunts]

10:59.491 --> 11:01.744
[sighs] Want another one?

11:02.787 --> 11:05.581
Look, she's goin'
through a really hard time.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.584
Yeah, she ain't the only one.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.669
[sighs]

11:09.752 --> 11:13.172
I told Abby about everything.
Now she's not talkin' to me.

11:13.255 --> 11:18.552
Well... [sighs] I'm sorry,
but she has to figure out what she wants.

11:18.635 --> 11:20.596
-[microwave beeping]
-Yeah, I know.

11:21.180 --> 11:26.685
In the meantime, you need to focus
on how you can help Heather.

11:26.769 --> 11:30.064
Oh, right, we're talkin' about
the other woman that hates me.

11:30.147 --> 11:34.151
Well, Colt, I'm sure there's
more than two women who hate you.

11:36.570 --> 11:42.409
Try to imagine what it would be like
to be a 23-year-old woman in a small town

11:42.493 --> 11:43.702
getting an abortion.

11:44.328 --> 11:48.415
I mean, she feels like
everybody's judging her, including you.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.793
I ain't judgin' her.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.420
I just think what she's doin'
is totally wrong.

11:54.671 --> 11:57.925
Let me rephrase.
Heather could use your support.

11:58.675 --> 12:01.888
Well, how am I supposed to support her
if I don't agree with what she's doin'?

12:01.971 --> 12:03.139
You do it because you care.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.517
I support you, and I don't agree
with practically anything you do.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.811
Like what?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.981
Well, you drink too much,
you eat too much red meat,

12:12.064 --> 12:13.775
constantly chewing tobacco...

12:13.858 --> 12:15.526
-Okay, I hear what--
-You have unprotected sex,

12:15.609 --> 12:17.153
you drive without a seatbelt,

12:17.236 --> 12:19.655
you shoot off fireworks
even after you dropped one in your pants.

12:19.738 --> 12:20.907
All right!

12:22.324 --> 12:23.492
I hear you.

12:25.577 --> 12:26.829
I'll go talk to Heather.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.208
Thank you.
I knew I raised a good person.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.334
[Colt sighs]

12:32.418 --> 12:35.129
Oh, hey, by the way,
I didn't drop the fireworks in my pants.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.006
I was tryin' to shoot a bottle rocket
out of my ass.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.346
I'm not an idiot!

12:58.360 --> 13:00.112
-Hey.
-What?

13:03.032 --> 13:04.450
Can we talk for a second?

13:04.533 --> 13:05.910
Think we've talked enough.

13:05.993 --> 13:09.121
Look, I'm... I'm not here
to try to change your mind.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.000
Fine. Come on in.

13:13.084 --> 13:16.503
Well, actually...
[stammers] it's kinda nice out here.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.924
The snow is pretty.
The air is crisp.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.550
You're scared of my mom, aren't you?

13:21.633 --> 13:24.261
She's got a gun
and she's not afraid of prison.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.387
I'm terrified.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.400
Look, I know that you and my mom talked...

13:40.444 --> 13:43.572
and I'm sorry...
if you think I'm judgin' you...

13:44.323 --> 13:45.366
'cause I'm not.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.911
Really? So when you told me
I'm taking the easy way out,

13:48.995 --> 13:50.162
that was you not judging me?

13:50.246 --> 13:51.455
[sighs]

13:53.082 --> 13:54.083
I'm sorry.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.754
You see how easy it is?

13:58.837 --> 14:01.632
I mean, you're judgin' me right now.
And, by the way, I forgive you.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.261
Not really in a joking mood, Colt.

14:05.344 --> 14:08.139
Okay. But tellin' me not to be funny

14:08.222 --> 14:10.057
is kind of like tellin' me
not to be good-lookin'.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.558
[stammers] I can try.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.022
Right. Sorry.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.233
Look...

14:22.444 --> 14:25.614
we're probably not gonna ever
see eye to eye on this...

14:28.159 --> 14:29.869
but I want to support you.

14:31.495 --> 14:32.538
I care about you.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.333
Okay.

14:40.171 --> 14:41.172
You doin' all right?

14:42.048 --> 14:44.550
[scoffs] Not really.

14:45.759 --> 14:48.304
I feel like everybody in town
is just talkin' about me.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.641
I'm sure that's not true,
but I know the feeling.

14:52.724 --> 14:55.852
[stammers] When I lost that playoff game
my junior year,

14:55.937 --> 14:58.064
someone spray-painted "Fuck Colt"
on the water tower.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.692
It was Rooster, but I mean, it still hurt.

15:03.735 --> 15:06.030
Kinda messed up
they still haven't painted over that.

15:06.113 --> 15:09.616
[chuckles] Yeah, I did...
then Rooster put it back up there.

15:14.746 --> 15:17.959
-[stammers] So, when are you gonna...
-Tomorrow.

15:18.542 --> 15:19.376
To--

15:20.252 --> 15:21.253
Wow.

15:22.838 --> 15:23.839
Okay.

15:25.674 --> 15:26.800
Can I give you a ride?

15:28.094 --> 15:30.387
I don't think that's a good idea, Colt.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.681
It's already pretty emotional and...

15:32.764 --> 15:35.267
I need to go with someone who's
dead inside, like my sister Darlene.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.269
I can be dead inside.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.813
I mean, I have been for 15 years,
drivin' past the water tower.

15:39.896 --> 15:43.192
[sighs] Look, to be honest, Colt...

15:43.817 --> 15:45.777
I don't wanna sit in a car
with someone for 30 minutes

15:45.861 --> 15:47.154
who doesn't believe in what I'm doing.

15:47.238 --> 15:51.283
Uh, what I believe
doesn't matter right now.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.244
[stammers] I mean,
if we were havin' this baby,

15:53.327 --> 15:57.206
I would drive you to the hospital
and I'd be there for the entire thing.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.916
[stammers] This is my responsibility, too.

16:01.918 --> 16:04.296
I'm just asking you
to let me support you.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.303
All right, fine.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.514
Thanks.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.349
Okay.

16:16.808 --> 16:17.977
What time do I pick you up?

16:20.229 --> 16:22.898
Does your truck have trash bags
for windows?

16:25.234 --> 16:26.318
Yeah.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.694
We'll take my car.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.702
-[Colt] Hey.
-What's up?

16:37.954 --> 16:38.955
[Colt] Whatcha doin'?

16:39.831 --> 16:42.668
Workin' on a report...
[sighs] havin' a drink.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.129
Oh, it's like high school
all over again, huh?

16:45.212 --> 16:47.423
Hmm. Yep.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.051
Except I can't pay David Jennings
to write these for me.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.219
Though I did give him a call.

16:52.844 --> 16:55.097
-Isn't David Jennings dead?
-Yeah.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.892
That's what his mom said
when she answered the phone.

17:00.727 --> 17:02.563
-Want a beer?
-Yeah, sure.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.939
[Rooster grunting]

17:04.023 --> 17:05.566
Thank you. [shudders]

17:05.649 --> 17:08.777
What you doin' out here?
It's freezin'.

17:08.860 --> 17:13.532
Well, from this spot,
I just barely connect to the house Wi-Fi.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.658
Don't tell Dad.

17:16.827 --> 17:20.164
Out here, my fridge and my bathroom
are in the same spot, so that's cool.

17:21.748 --> 17:23.834
So... what's up with you?

17:27.003 --> 17:28.672
Taking Heather to the clinic tomorrow.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.053
Damn.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.137
Yeah.

17:38.765 --> 17:40.016
You wanna talk about it?

17:41.393 --> 17:42.561
[clicks tongue] Nope.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.814
That's why I come out here.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.775
To hang out and get drunk with you.

17:50.236 --> 17:54.615
Well, can't get drunk with you,
but I can maintain drunk with you.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.163
What are you workin' on a report for?

18:01.247 --> 18:04.541
Dude... [sighs] this job
is not what I thought it was gonna be.

18:05.542 --> 18:09.796
It's like that time I signed up for that
women's studies class at junior college.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.133
Thought it'd be a good place
to pick up chicks.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.718
Turned out it was just me
and 40 other dudes with the same idea.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.265
And one disappointed lesbian.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.812
That's exactly why I took that
human sexuality class at Florida State.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.856
[chuckles] Oh, yeah?
Didn't work, neither?

18:27.939 --> 18:31.485
No, I got laid a ton.
I was the fuckin' quarterback.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.198
Can you really call yourself
the quarterback

18:36.282 --> 18:38.242
if you only complete passes
to the other team?

18:39.285 --> 18:41.995
[chuckles lightly] You're an asshole.

18:42.078 --> 18:43.164
[chuckles]

18:45.081 --> 18:46.333
[Rooster shudders]

18:48.001 --> 18:49.002
Look, man...

18:49.961 --> 18:53.340
I know this whole thing
with Heather sucks, but... [grunts]

18:54.508 --> 18:58.137
with the passage of a little time,
the healin' will begin.

19:00.096 --> 19:02.516
Even though it seems impossible
right now...

19:04.643 --> 19:06.687
you'll be a stronger person
for the experience.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.272
Wow.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.858
You learn that for your women's studies?

19:12.859 --> 19:14.570
No, David Jennings' mom.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.157
We talked for, like, 20 minutes
about her dead son.

19:22.869 --> 19:24.163
I wonder if she's still hot.

19:30.877 --> 19:35.006
I'm just sayin', if you gave me a key,
I could open the bar for you.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.133
[water running]

19:37.218 --> 19:39.678
Hank, do you hear that?

19:45.976 --> 19:47.102
Oh, shit!

19:49.688 --> 19:53.900
God, must you take everything I love?

20:03.952 --> 20:04.995
Oh, hey.

20:05.078 --> 20:06.372
Drake, sic 'em.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.585
[clicks tongue] Good boy, Drake.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.963
Don't get cocky.
He may be comin' back with a weapon.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.758
What are you doin' with my tools?

20:17.841 --> 20:20.093
I'm going to help Mom.
Bar flooded.

20:20.176 --> 20:21.803
I didn't hear anything about that.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.805
Well, that's the way you want it, right?
No one botherin' you?

20:23.889 --> 20:27.351
What's the matter? Your Hello Kitty Ranch
doesn't have any tools?

20:28.894 --> 20:31.647
It's My Little Pony Ranch.
Why can't anybody fuckin' remember that?

20:32.523 --> 20:35.692
And no, Dad, it's like an hour away,
all right? I ain't got time for this shit.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.112
[toy squeaking]

20:41.282 --> 20:42.658
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.166
[indistinct chatter]

20:53.794 --> 20:56.547
Hi, I have an appointment.
Heather Roth.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.174
Okay, just fill out these forms,
and we'll call you.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.592
-Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:04.220 --> 21:06.598
Uh, are these condoms free?

21:07.182 --> 21:08.183
[mouths]

21:09.601 --> 21:11.437
It's a little late now, isn't it?

21:23.740 --> 21:24.950
[sighs]

21:27.828 --> 21:29.496
You doin' okay? [clears throat]

21:30.664 --> 21:31.665
Yeah.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.128
Oh, hey, I, uh...
I brought you somethin'.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.922
Whoa! Shit. [grunts]

21:42.384 --> 21:43.469
It's, uh...

21:46.054 --> 21:48.640
my, uh, Saint Christopher's medal.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.310
It's supposed to protect you.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.983
I know it's silly,
but when I was playin' football,

21:58.066 --> 22:00.486
I had, like, four surgeries on my knee.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.113
I wore it every time, came out fine.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.450
Maybe you should have worn it
while you were playin'.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.915
Maybe I should have wore it
when we were fuckin'. [chuckles]

22:21.006 --> 22:22.215
It's real sweet of you.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.635
I'm glad you're here, Colt.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.638
'Course.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.100
We're in this together, right?

22:33.602 --> 22:34.728
Thanks.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.819
"Genital Warts and You."

22:47.449 --> 22:48.742
Why are they kayakin'?

22:57.250 --> 22:58.835
[sighs] All right, Ma...

22:59.878 --> 23:02.756
I thawed out that pipe in the attic...
[grunts]

23:02.839 --> 23:04.966
flushed it
and replaced the section that burst.

23:05.050 --> 23:08.929
-[sighs] Thank you, honey.
-Yep. [sighs]

23:09.012 --> 23:12.182
Hey, if I owned a bookstore,
would you still help me out?

23:13.141 --> 23:16.437
If you think I haven't gotten drunk
in a Barnes & Noble, you'd be wrong.

23:20.190 --> 23:22.443
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:22.526 --> 23:26.362
Thought maybe you could use this
to keep your pipes from freezin' again.

23:26.447 --> 23:27.864
Job's already done, Dad.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.163
Is that my heater from the huntin' cabin?

23:36.957 --> 23:38.625
Your mother needs help,

23:38.709 --> 23:41.712
so it's okay to take
other people's shit, right?

23:43.672 --> 23:45.381
Is this my heater from the Airstream?

23:45.466 --> 23:46.925
Huh. That's weird.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.054
Bad news.

23:51.137 --> 23:55.183
The leak made it to the storage room.
Shorted out your freezer.

23:55.266 --> 23:56.768
Shit.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.103
Are you kidding me?

23:59.104 --> 24:00.396
More bad news.

24:00.481 --> 24:04.651
It also appears that three or four
of your beers leaked.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.530
[Maggie sighs]

24:09.239 --> 24:11.241
Great. Now I gotta replace the freezer.

24:11.324 --> 24:14.369
Every dollar I make
goes right back into this place.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.913
It'll be all right.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.541
We can move some of your stuff
to the freezer at the ranch.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.001
Yeah, thanks.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.878
I'm gonna go check that pipe that burst.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.379
I said I fixed it.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.215
Think I can't do anything right?

24:27.799 --> 24:30.552
Well, did you fix the pipe
like you fixed the brakes on the truck?

24:30.636 --> 24:32.971
-Come on, guys.
-Brakes work fine, Dad.

24:33.054 --> 24:36.141
What doesn't work so good
is your reflexes, your eyesight

24:36.224 --> 24:37.601
and that gate you plowed through.

24:40.436 --> 24:43.607
The fuckin' gate wouldn't have swung shut
if you'd leveled it out.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.483
Oh, yeah, Dad?
Let's do an eye test right now.

24:45.567 --> 24:46.693
How many fingers do you see?

24:46.777 --> 24:48.194
I see two.

24:49.988 --> 24:52.115
All right! Enough.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.786
I'm so sick of this.

24:56.703 --> 25:01.041
I'm so sick of the same people
having the same argument in the same town.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.501
I'm sorry, Mags.

25:03.585 --> 25:07.130
You don't need to put up with our bullshit
on top of everything else.

25:07.213 --> 25:08.339
Yeah, sorry, Mom.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.552
Although,
I think it's mostly Dad's bullshit.

25:14.054 --> 25:17.182
Maybe this flood is a sign.
I should just sell this place.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.686
-What?
-You... you love it here.

25:21.269 --> 25:22.938
I'm not so sure anymore.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.230
Are you serious?

25:25.732 --> 25:27.108
What am I waitin' around for?

25:29.903 --> 25:31.780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You leavin' right now?

25:32.363 --> 25:34.115
No, right now I'm gonna get a Corona,

25:34.199 --> 25:37.869
stand in three inches of dirty water,
and pretend I'm in the Caribbean.

25:53.426 --> 25:54.720
Well, shit.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.484
Don't say a fuckin' word.

26:16.574 --> 26:17.909
Hey, um...

26:18.702 --> 26:20.662
I know this is stupid.

26:20.746 --> 26:23.331
When I was a kid,
my mom would take me to the doctor,

26:23.414 --> 26:25.792
and afterwards she'd always
take me to the Dairy Queen.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.419
You wanna go to the Dairy Queen?

26:32.298 --> 26:34.175
No, thanks.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.301
Okay.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.640
You mind if I go to the Dairy Queen?

26:41.307 --> 26:44.185
'Cause now that I said it, I can't stop
thinkin' about that Oreo Blizzard.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.603
[chuckles]

26:50.108 --> 26:51.276
You all right?

26:53.361 --> 26:56.031
Yeah. It's just, um...

26:57.365 --> 26:59.701
Is it the question about
how much you drink in a week?

27:01.662 --> 27:03.664
'Cause I always say, like, two beers.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.832
I mean, there's no reason
you gotta tell your doctor the truth.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.125
-[chuckles]
-[sighs]

27:08.251 --> 27:11.629
No, it's not that. I'm...

27:12.756 --> 27:13.799
I'm all done.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.218
Okay.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.138
Want me to take it up for you?

27:33.985 --> 27:34.986
Heather?

27:39.032 --> 27:40.033
I can't.

27:43.704 --> 27:44.705
What?

27:48.208 --> 27:49.500
I can't do this.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.715
I thought it's what I wanted, but...

27:55.716 --> 27:57.968
now that I'm here
and it's all happenin'...

28:04.307 --> 28:05.350
Okay.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.228
You wanna leave?

28:10.063 --> 28:12.357
Yeah, I do.

28:16.486 --> 28:17.863
And, like, not come back?

28:21.032 --> 28:22.826
Is that still okay with you?

28:23.785 --> 28:26.997
Yeah, it's...
it's always been okay with me.

28:27.914 --> 28:28.957
I just...

28:30.541 --> 28:32.210
I wanna make sure that's what you want.

28:33.628 --> 28:34.838
[sighs]

28:36.589 --> 28:38.299
All right. [chuckles]

28:39.384 --> 28:40.593
We're doin' this.

28:40.676 --> 28:42.678
[both chuckle]

28:44.139 --> 28:45.891
Holy fuck! [chuckles]

28:47.683 --> 28:48.727
I'll be a dad!

28:48.810 --> 28:50.395
[both chuckle]

28:50.478 --> 28:52.688
Holy fuck, I'm gonna be a dad.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.065
[chuckles]

28:55.901 --> 28:57.568
-Let's... Come on!
-[chuckles]

28:57.652 --> 28:59.738
[stammers] We gotta go
to the Dairy Queen now.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.239
[both chuckle]
