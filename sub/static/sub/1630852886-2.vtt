<i>Applying mascara can drastically change
the appearance of a woman,</i>

00:51.384 --> 00:54.471
<i>and we will show you that
through this live show.</i>

00:54.554 --> 00:58.391
<i>When a woman has long and curly eyelashes,</i>

00:58.475 --> 01:00.852
<i>it makes her look sensual, feminine,</i>

01:00.935 --> 01:03.396
<i>-and it also brings out her sexiness.
-Yes.</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:05.648
<i>That's why people call Blanche</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:07.192
<i>a sexy mascara.</i>

01:31.341 --> 01:32.550
Damn it.

01:37.722 --> 01:38.890
You guys can have them.

01:39.891 --> 01:43.853
You have a friend who's a cosmetics
shop manager at a department store.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.439
And that friend is right here.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.358
Why do you keep doing this?

01:48.441 --> 01:49.692
Eyes are very important

01:50.527 --> 01:52.195
-for women our age.
-Says who?

01:52.278 --> 01:53.446
The internet.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.657
I knew home shopping was a scam.

01:55.740 --> 01:59.494
Practice with them.
These aren't the problem. It's your skill.

01:59.577 --> 02:03.289
I told you. You're better off
spending your money on food.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.541
Come here.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.918
-Try it on me.
-Whatever.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.796
Hey. You're very wise.

02:09.879 --> 02:14.259
Here. Don't start from the bottom.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.219
-I thought it was for me.
-You do this.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.555
-Watch this.
-She's pretty even without mascara.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.766
ONE ABSURD DAY

02:23.768 --> 02:25.687
EPISODE 2

02:49.794 --> 02:51.629
I can't believe this.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.528
This should've been our first encounter.

03:17.488 --> 03:18.573
We had quite a ride.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.246
I'm actually relieved.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.750
If this was our first encounter,

03:28.833 --> 03:31.836
all that's happened
might have never happened.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.672
Because I liked the time…

03:35.548 --> 03:38.426
I spent with you, Dr. Cha.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.678
Okay, how about this?

03:40.762 --> 03:42.680
We're not in our twenties.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.682
It was an understandable accident.

03:44.766 --> 03:48.144
This is just how we were supposed to meet.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.730
I'm a doctor entrusting you
with running my clinic,

03:50.813 --> 03:53.441
and you're the doctor
who'll fill in for me for a year.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.944
Let's settle it at that and start over.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.160
Okay. Sounds good.

04:05.536 --> 04:06.537
Okay.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.373
That's a relief.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.333
But just one thing.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.168
What?

04:12.252 --> 04:14.254
It wasn't an accident.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.632
Well, at least it wasn't for me.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.009
It's been a long time since…

04:20.551 --> 04:23.012
Gosh, how should I put it?

04:24.973 --> 04:26.432
Anyway, it wasn't an accident.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.071
Well, what I meant to say is…

04:40.655 --> 04:43.533
I think we should
begin talking about the clinic.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.118
Sure. I'm fine with anything.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.554
Please.

05:08.516 --> 05:12.437
Mi-jo is going to take
a sabbatical before she turns 40.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.731
So I…

05:16.065 --> 05:18.693
thought about what
I should change in my life

05:19.694 --> 05:20.570
before I turn 40.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.947
We've had this

05:24.157 --> 05:27.368
vague and sad relationship for a while,
and I think we should end it.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.333
How about only quitting smoking?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.668
Just end it at that.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.045
If you quit both,

05:37.128 --> 05:38.880
the withdrawal symptoms will be tough.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.841
Holding out like this is already so hard.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.766
Is it because of Ju-won?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.979
We can just live with him.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.482
Jin-seok, I promise…

05:58.858 --> 06:00.485
I promise I'll be a good mom.

06:01.402 --> 06:02.695
Chan-young.

06:05.615 --> 06:09.452
My gosh, I'm a horrible person.
I must be out of my mind.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.123
I'm trying to make

06:14.999 --> 06:16.876
his parents get divorced for my sake.

06:20.671 --> 06:21.506
I must be insane.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.138
I'm the one to blame.

06:29.889 --> 06:30.723
I am.

06:40.399 --> 06:42.276
You can't even ask me to stay with you.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.030
I feel bad for you.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.011
I'll see you at the clinic.
You know where it is, right?

07:09.095 --> 07:10.638
Yes, Jin-seok sent me the link.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.476
Can I ask you something?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.688
Sure.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.023
Why work in Korea
with such an impressive resume?

07:21.107 --> 07:22.859
It must've been hard to pass the KMLE.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.865
I couldn't just turn 40 like this.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.164
There's something I have to do.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.877
And it's something
you have to do in Korea?

07:41.461 --> 07:42.962
At the moment, yes, I believe so.

07:45.756 --> 07:46.799
I see.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.431
Goodbye then.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.443
You don't need to do this.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.986
I can take care of myself.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.571
It's just manners.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.199
Bye.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.397
Are you open?

08:45.983 --> 08:46.859
Hello.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.112
We're opening tomorrow.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.365
Oh.

08:53.824 --> 08:57.161
When do you close?

08:57.245 --> 09:00.081
Oh, we close at 8:00 p.m.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.793
If you come tomorrow,
the <i>gochu japchae</i> will be on the house.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.628
Please come.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.341
I get off work past 8:00 p.m.

09:12.426 --> 09:16.889
Do you know where the owner went?

09:17.515 --> 09:19.433
Oh, me?

09:23.145 --> 09:24.313
I'm right here.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.233
Oh, not you. I was talking

09:27.316 --> 09:31.195
about the owner
of the previous restaurant.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.282
Oh, I see. No, I don't know.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.284
I liked their dried pollack.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.827
Our food is delicious too.

09:38.452 --> 09:40.037
But you close at 8:00 p.m.

09:40.746 --> 09:44.083
The previous owner closed pretty late,

09:44.166 --> 09:45.543
so I came by…

09:46.627 --> 09:47.628
pretty often.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.008
Good luck with your business.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.135
Thank you. Bye.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.195
Let me see your eyes.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.662
Gosh, this mascara
is actually pretty good.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.830
Normally, you'd look like a panda.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.626
I watched carefully
when they sold this on TV.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.587
It's waterproof. You need to take it off.

11:12.254 --> 11:13.547
It's sexy mascara.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.342
How can you be joking right now?

11:25.643 --> 11:26.811
Did the talk go well?

11:30.523 --> 11:31.357
Yes.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.901
What did Jin-seok say?

11:38.072 --> 11:39.490
I'm worried.

11:40.699 --> 11:41.951
He'll have a hard time.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.120
What about you?

11:45.496 --> 11:48.791
Can't you tell by how much
the sexy mascara smudged?

12:00.052 --> 12:01.053
Sleep over.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.847
Then I'm taking the bed.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.308
Must you go to the States?

12:10.312 --> 12:12.857
I want to take a break.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.821
Fine.

12:20.781 --> 12:24.160
I know how hard you've been working.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.621
Come with me.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.125
Being near Jin-seok
will only make it harder for you.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.837
I'll treat you much better than he did.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.466
Hey, that's just
burying our heads in the sand.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.759
I'll think of him wherever I am.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.761
I spent my thirties with him.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.311
Right.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.211
-Where's Ju-won?
-He said he was going to bed but…

13:55.668 --> 13:56.502
Did you eat?

13:56.585 --> 13:59.004
Yes, I did. I'm going to take a shower.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.156
<i>Peonies.</i>

14:26.240 --> 14:30.911
They'll be in full bloom by tomorrow.
They have a killer scent.

14:31.620 --> 14:35.249
Can I have one of them?

14:42.840 --> 14:44.216
So the watch guy

14:45.134 --> 14:47.177
turned out to be the doctor?

14:48.721 --> 14:50.431
It's really frustrating.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.282
Is it okay if I soothe my heartache

15:08.365 --> 15:10.451
by congratulating your new beginning?

15:11.327 --> 15:12.620
What do you mean?

15:13.996 --> 15:14.997
Hey.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.586
I must say,
this is a really nice way to start things.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.380
I mean, think about it.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.508
Two people meeting,
seeing if they like each other,

15:26.592 --> 15:29.470
and trying to figure out
if they're right for each other.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.763
It's exhausting, right?

15:33.849 --> 15:36.518
I like how fast things are going for you.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.438
Are you seriously excited?

15:40.481 --> 15:41.815
Didn't you break up today?

15:49.573 --> 15:51.575
You don't have to be so damn blunt.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.039
Sleep on the floor.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.585
You said I could sleep on the bed.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.504
No way. Right now,

16:04.046 --> 16:07.716
my entire body aches
because you hit me with the sad reality.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.220
You'll be fine sleeping on the floor
since your heart is fluttering.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.304
Hey.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.599
My heart isn't fluttering.

16:17.101 --> 16:20.145
We're past that age now.
We just slept together once.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.149
We may be turning 40 soon,
but we're not emotionless.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.277
I got excited just by hearing it.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.488
You sleep here. Okay?

16:30.614 --> 16:31.699
Darn it.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.410
<i>Where are you?</i>

16:34.493 --> 16:37.621
<i>You just passed by.
Turn around and come back…</i>

16:38.747 --> 16:40.791
<i>Hello?</i>

16:41.917 --> 16:43.210
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

16:44.795 --> 16:46.005
Yes?

16:48.298 --> 16:50.467
That's enough.
You'll have to pee in your sleep.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.593
This is my last can.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.220
You already finished four cans?

16:53.804 --> 16:55.514
Why do you always drink like a fish?

16:56.348 --> 16:58.434
What can I do? I'm good at handling it.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.770
I gave birth to a heavy drinker.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.023
Like father, like daughter.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.774
-Go to bed.
-Okay.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.323
My gosh, he's so hot.

17:53.655 --> 17:54.782
Why aren't you sleeping?

17:56.742 --> 17:58.035
I have no sleeping pills.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.538
Can't you sleep without them?

18:02.706 --> 18:03.707
No.

18:07.669 --> 18:08.879
Has it been a while?

18:11.965 --> 18:12.966
Yes.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.432
Get some good rest abroad…

18:21.809 --> 18:23.685
so you can sleep without them.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.571
Mi-jo.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.367
I think your boobs have gotten bigger.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.454
You loony.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.831
Come on.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.290
Let's go sleep.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.168
-Come on.
-Okay.

19:29.793 --> 19:33.881
This is Doctor Kim Seon-u.
He'll be working with us starting today.

19:34.548 --> 19:35.507
You should say hello.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.509
I look forward to it.

19:42.639 --> 19:46.560
Was I supposed to introduce myself
starting from my date of birth?

19:46.643 --> 19:48.395
That's unnecessary. Are you married?

19:49.021 --> 19:49.855
I'm single.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.359
Now I want to know your date of birth.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.069
Are you younger than Dr. Cha?

19:56.153 --> 19:59.198
What makes you think he's younger than me?

19:59.281 --> 20:01.074
I can tell you're a dermatologist.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.993
You have the skin of a 20-year-old.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.703
I only apply toner.

20:04.786 --> 20:07.956
Don't say that.
It'll make us run out of business.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.958
"Toner is all I use
to maintain good skin."

20:10.584 --> 20:12.544
No one will come to a dermatology clinic.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.006
Ms. Cha, stop trying to intimidate him.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.888
Ms. Cha will introduce you
to the medical equipment we use.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.598
If you have any questions…

20:24.681 --> 20:25.515
-I do.
-I do.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.810
Ask him during your personal time.
I think that's enough for an introduction.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.812
Let's have a good one, everyone.

20:32.898 --> 20:33.815
Where's my office?

20:33.899 --> 20:35.108
I'll show you where it is.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.790
He seems decent.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.375
-How old is he?
-The same age as me.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.669
Good luck.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.338
-With what?
-With everything.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.133
I'm leaving soon, okay?

21:00.217 --> 21:03.178
These days, a lot of clinics
have multiple doctors.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.806
Just stay. You can work less hard.

21:05.889 --> 21:06.723
No.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.768
When will you tell Mom and Dad?

21:09.851 --> 21:10.936
Soon.

21:14.189 --> 21:15.023
Goodness!

21:25.409 --> 21:27.703
I just said goodbye to my friend.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.330
Yes. Right now? The department store.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.374
I ran out of serum, so I came to buy one.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.753
What? No, it's okay. I'll buy my own.

21:38.630 --> 21:42.175
Your card? Oh, right. I have it.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.845
Seriously?
Can I really buy it with your card?

21:44.928 --> 21:48.181
Then can I get
a luxury item instead of a serum?

21:49.933 --> 21:51.393
Why are you stuttering?

21:52.227 --> 21:54.479
Okay. I'll see you later.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.440
Bye.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.318
Do you need a serum?

21:59.401 --> 22:01.111
Yes. What's good?

22:01.194 --> 22:02.237
Here.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.239
Here you go.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.158
Thank you. Enjoy the product.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.492
Thank you.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.036
Bye.

22:13.915 --> 22:17.002
She gets to buy stuff
with her boyfriend's card. I'm jealous.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.421
Should I give you my card?

22:19.504 --> 22:20.505
Sure.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.590
My goodness.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.859
Your swing comes down too hastily.

22:41.568 --> 22:43.904
I waited a bit before the swing.

22:44.488 --> 22:47.240
Stop for a bit longer.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.910
Then do your swing. Try it again.

22:49.993 --> 22:50.869
Okay.

22:57.375 --> 22:58.210
Better, right?

22:58.293 --> 23:01.171
Your swing is stable.
Just forget about the distance.

23:01.254 --> 23:03.173
It's hard to forget about it.

23:04.966 --> 23:07.010
Excuse me for a second.

23:11.681 --> 23:12.557
Hey.

23:13.517 --> 23:14.518
Yes.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.063
Oh, really? That's quicker than expected.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.899
Yes. Me and two of my friends.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.569
Thanks a lot.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.655
We'll make sure we fast.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.032
I'll treat you to a meal. Thanks.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.005
Doesn't it get cold in the winter?

23:46.133 --> 23:49.678
Doesn't it get chilly
because it's on the basement floor?

23:53.682 --> 23:54.933
Why are you here?

23:55.016 --> 23:56.643
Oh, right.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.953
I'm sure you know.
It's an art school in Paris.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.330
You wanted to study more.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.957
You're 40 soon. You should go.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.293
No.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.589
I can't speak French or English.

24:25.672 --> 24:26.965
You can learn there.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.050
What's the matter with you?

24:30.010 --> 24:33.430
Mi-jo wants me to follow her to the US,
and you want me to study abroad.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.182
I'm one lucky girl.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.810
Better yet, why don't you come with me?

24:44.816 --> 24:45.817
Chan-young.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.278
You were right.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.615
Quitting two things at once is too hard.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.745
You're making me want to smoke again.

25:04.878 --> 25:07.714
Chan-young, why am I so indecisive?

25:09.257 --> 25:10.258
You realize that now?

25:12.677 --> 25:13.762
I know, right?

25:18.016 --> 25:19.226
It was me.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.479
I carried this on for too long.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.362
Don't worry about me. You can go.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.633
You really do get off work late.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.514
Me?

25:57.597 --> 26:01.142
I extended our business hours
for my neighbor's sake.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.519
But you didn't even come.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.439
You did that for me?

26:07.190 --> 26:08.525
<i>Is this…</i>

26:10.485 --> 26:12.195
<i>what being hit on feels like?</i>

26:12.279 --> 26:15.115
Actually, the district chief suggested it.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.284
Oh, I see.

26:17.367 --> 26:20.787
Come and try the <i>gochu japchae</i>.
It's on the house.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.498
I have a medical checkup tomorrow,

26:23.581 --> 26:25.375
so I can't eat anything.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.585
I'll come this weekend with my friends.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.087
Okay. Please do.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.422
-Okay.
-Okay.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.465
-Bye.
-Bye.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.759
Bye.

26:37.262 --> 26:40.849
Why did he even talk to me
if he wasn't hitting on me?

26:56.364 --> 26:57.198
Come in.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.038
Gosh, this is…

27:03.121 --> 27:05.915
You'll have to treat
the patients on your own today.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.083
What about Dr. Cha?

27:07.167 --> 27:08.960
She's getting a medical checkup.

27:09.044 --> 27:12.088
She wants to get a full checkup
before she leaves for the States.

27:12.672 --> 27:15.592
She really is composed and clever.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.260
I'm not so sure.

27:17.927 --> 27:19.429
You two seem really close.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.558
-Do you have a younger sibling?
-Yes.

27:23.641 --> 27:24.476
Is he or she nice?

27:24.559 --> 27:25.894
Yes, I guess.

27:25.977 --> 27:29.481
Well, Mi-jo is the complete opposite
of that. You get what I mean, right?

27:30.440 --> 27:31.441
Have a good one.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.741
Ms. Cha…

27:40.658 --> 27:42.035
and Cha Mi-jo.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.039
I see.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.458
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

27:49.042 --> 27:52.170
Don't you think the restaurant owner
was hitting on you?

27:52.253 --> 27:53.505
He changed his business hours.

27:53.588 --> 27:56.007
He said the district chief suggested it.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.385
Freebies are normally fried dumplings.

27:58.468 --> 28:01.721
But he offered <i>gochu japchae</i>.
That means it's love.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.765
<i>Gochu japchae</i> means it's love?

28:03.848 --> 28:06.142
Don't put ideas in her head.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.395
Let's go there after we're done.

28:08.478 --> 28:09.813
I'll buy you <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.148
I told him I'd go with my friends.

28:12.232 --> 28:15.819
Let's just go and eat there
so I can walk by in peace.

28:15.902 --> 28:18.405
<i>Gochu japchae</i> does sound pretty nice--

28:18.488 --> 28:20.532
No, we can't eat anything greasy today.

28:20.615 --> 28:23.910
Gosh, come on.
Let's go take a look at him.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.787
He hit on Joo-hee.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.622
Gosh, he didn't hit on me.

28:27.705 --> 28:31.751
Maybe a little bit.
It's hard to say, isn't it?

28:31.835 --> 28:34.212
-Yes, very much.
-It's time to draw your blood.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.840
-Okay.
-Start with her

28:36.923 --> 28:38.883
-who recently got hit on.
-Stop it.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.349
-I'm telling you. I'm right.
-Just drop it.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.374
He looks young.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.544
It's fine if he's less
than ten years younger.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.337
Can we talk about this later?

29:29.309 --> 29:31.436
Hi. Hello.

29:33.897 --> 29:37.317
Why did you bow so many times?
What are you, a bobblehead?

29:37.400 --> 29:39.319
You guys are making me nervous.

29:39.402 --> 29:42.113
You have a long way to go.
This is nothing.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.408
You got this.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.994
We'll try to come up with a plan.

29:48.077 --> 29:50.872
So don't drink too much.
Don't get drunk and ruin it.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.373
She's right. I'm worried.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.417
You live nearby,
so don't drink for a while.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.419
Gosh, will you guys stop it?

29:57.295 --> 29:58.588
What if he's too young?

29:59.506 --> 30:00.757
Didn't you hear Mi-jo?

30:00.840 --> 30:03.092
It's fine if he's less
than ten years younger.

30:09.015 --> 30:09.849
Hi!

30:09.933 --> 30:11.059
Hey, you're here.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.310
Do you need help?

30:12.393 --> 30:13.978
No, it's okay. Just have a seat.

30:14.062 --> 30:16.439
Hey, look what I bought.

30:17.482 --> 30:18.316
Oh.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.908
-Thank you for this.
-Sure.

30:31.579 --> 30:33.373
Let's have some Kaoliang liquor.

30:33.456 --> 30:34.374
-Yes.
-Why?

30:34.457 --> 30:35.959
If you score a goal, you win.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.461
That's a strong defense.

30:38.545 --> 30:39.796
Then strike harder.

30:39.879 --> 30:42.257
Yes? Do you need anything?

30:42.340 --> 30:43.550
Well…

30:43.633 --> 30:45.510
A bottle of Kaoliang liquor, please.

30:45.593 --> 30:47.095
-Okay.
-Sure!

30:47.762 --> 30:48.596
I'll get it.

31:07.448 --> 31:08.783
Here you go.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.709
Do you need anything else?

31:17.792 --> 31:19.961
What? Well…

31:21.296 --> 31:22.630
You're pretty.

31:24.757 --> 31:25.884
Thank you.

31:25.967 --> 31:26.801
Sure.

31:29.512 --> 31:31.472
"You're pretty"? You're unbelievable.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.610
Alcohol is the best way
to cleanse your body.

31:43.693 --> 31:46.362
I'm getting dizzy.
I haven't eaten anything.

31:46.863 --> 31:49.198
What's there to worry about?
Call the watch guy.

31:52.452 --> 31:56.247
I'm going to get drunk and puke on you.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.625
I'll use it to give you a facial.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.126
-Thanks.
-Sure.

32:00.209 --> 32:01.669
Stop it. We're about to eat.

32:03.713 --> 32:06.007
-You're working hard.
-Hey, you came.

32:06.591 --> 32:07.425
I got hungry.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.594
-Grab a table. I have orders piled up.
-Hey…

32:09.677 --> 32:10.845
-Sure. Take your time.
-Okay.

32:11.512 --> 32:12.931
I must be drunk.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.140
Did you call him?

32:14.766 --> 32:16.726
Hye-jin, it's been so long.

32:16.809 --> 32:18.353
Long time no see, Seon-u.

32:31.407 --> 32:32.492
Mi-jo?

32:32.575 --> 32:33.785
"Mi-jo"?

32:34.452 --> 32:35.453
Gosh.

32:35.536 --> 32:36.371
Hey.

32:37.538 --> 32:38.373
Mi-jo.

32:40.917 --> 32:41.834
Hey.

32:44.087 --> 32:46.214
My friend lives nearby.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.050
Enjoy your meal.

32:49.592 --> 32:51.177
If you're here alone, why don't--

32:52.095 --> 32:53.846
Don't hurt your friend like that.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.684
We ordered <i>yangjangpi</i>.

32:57.767 --> 33:00.979
<i>Yangjangpi</i>? I really like <i>yangjangpi</i>.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.023
I don't want Mi-jo…

33:04.107 --> 33:06.776
I mean, I don't want Dr. Cha
to feel uncomfortable.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.696
If he sits alone,
it'll be even more awkward.

33:10.488 --> 33:11.948
Come join us.

33:29.424 --> 33:32.760
Can we get one more spoon
and a pair of chopsticks, please?

33:34.053 --> 33:35.054
Sure.

33:36.681 --> 33:40.226
Then I guess I'll have to join you guys.

33:45.064 --> 33:46.065
Gosh.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.825
Fate must've brought us all together.

33:56.659 --> 33:59.287
Do you know the owner of this restaurant?

33:59.370 --> 34:00.997
Yes, he's a good friend.

34:01.080 --> 34:01.914
I see.

34:02.498 --> 34:05.752
I heard you and Mi-jo
work at the same clinic.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.503
Well, she is

34:08.087 --> 34:09.464
my employer.

34:10.173 --> 34:13.885
Employer? Gosh, I'm getting tipsy.

34:13.968 --> 34:15.553
When can we get our food?

34:15.636 --> 34:16.763
It's almost ready.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.266
Dr. Cha, go easy on the alcohol.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.313
MY ROMANTIC DAD

34:26.022 --> 34:26.939
Hey.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.024
It's your dad.

34:29.817 --> 34:31.319
Aren't you going to pick up?

34:31.402 --> 34:33.321
Damn it. Did Mi-hyeon tell him?

34:40.495 --> 34:42.371
Hello, my admirable father.

34:48.878 --> 34:52.757
Hey, Dad. I'm in the middle of something--

34:56.177 --> 34:58.179
I just picked up my purse.

34:58.262 --> 35:00.223
I'm leaving now.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.140
Bye.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.276
What's up?

35:14.487 --> 35:17.281
I still haven't told my parents yet.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.617
Stay sober.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.120
-Do you want me to call you a cab?
-Yes.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.371
Let me drive you home.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.872
It's okay.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.332
Samseong-dong. Near COEX Mall.

35:26.415 --> 35:27.708
Do you want the address?

35:27.792 --> 35:28.793
Hey.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.046
See you at the clinic.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.631
See you guys.

35:40.721 --> 35:41.931
I'll treat you next time.

35:46.310 --> 35:50.106
Do you also think
Mi-jo shouldn't go to the States?

35:50.189 --> 35:54.527
Obviously. Why waste her time there
when she can have fun here?

36:17.884 --> 36:19.677
You haven't eaten since your checkup.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.346
Thanks.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.812
Is your father strict?

36:30.771 --> 36:33.232
-Not really.
-Then are you an obedient daughter?

36:33.316 --> 36:36.652
But your sister told me
that you're the opposite of that.

36:36.736 --> 36:37.820
My sister said that?

36:54.212 --> 36:56.339
Aren't you on your way to getting scolded?

36:58.007 --> 36:59.008
What?

37:00.509 --> 37:01.594
Right here.

37:06.766 --> 37:07.767
Goodness.

37:28.704 --> 37:29.914
Goodbye.

37:29.997 --> 37:32.959
Thank you for the ride.
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.043
Okay.

37:34.126 --> 37:35.127
Bye, then.

37:42.510 --> 37:43.803
Bye.

37:47.181 --> 37:49.225
I bet she still smells of alcohol.

37:56.148 --> 37:56.983
Cha Mi-jo.

37:57.650 --> 38:00.444
Dad, I have no energy.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.863
I haven't eaten anything
because of a checkup.

38:02.947 --> 38:06.617
You called right when we were
about to get the <i>yangjangpi</i>.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.078
You drank on an empty stomach?

38:11.539 --> 38:13.249
Let's grill some beef.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.002
Should we?

38:27.722 --> 38:29.515
I feel much better now.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.488
Dad. Mom.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.116
You see…

38:47.658 --> 38:48.659
You can go.

38:49.910 --> 38:51.662
-What?
-Go and get some rest.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.707
Dad…

38:54.790 --> 38:58.502
When our bodies get sick,
we either get surgery or take medicine.

38:59.295 --> 39:02.006
When our minds get sick,
we should get good rest.

39:03.883 --> 39:07.386
When did you start having panic attacks?

39:10.598 --> 39:12.683
I did what I had to do
as your older sister.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.811
I tried to come up with something else,
but they wouldn't buy it.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.938
I had no choice
but to tell them the truth.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.900
It's not that serious.

39:20.983 --> 39:24.070
Thank goodness you chose
to take a break before it got serious.

39:25.946 --> 39:27.615
I'll go with you.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.367
-What?
-Me too.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.077
All hell has broken loose.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.371
Gosh, you guys can't come with me.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.998
It's like going clubbing with my parents.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.625
I'd rather have you go clubbing.

39:37.708 --> 39:40.586
I'm too old to grind at a club.

39:40.669 --> 39:43.381
Honey, let's have some wine.

39:44.924 --> 39:45.758
I feel down.

39:46.425 --> 39:47.551
Dad.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.930
<i>That day, it was raining cats and dogs</i>

39:51.013 --> 39:53.849
<i>I was sitting inside an old coffee shop</i>

39:55.267 --> 39:56.394
If you leave,

39:57.103 --> 39:59.063
who's going to sing "About Romance"?

39:59.146 --> 40:00.189
I'll call you.

40:00.272 --> 40:01.524
Let us come with you.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.234
Then I won't go.

40:03.317 --> 40:07.071
That's even better. You can rest here.

40:07.154 --> 40:08.656
Stop it.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.158
Just take me with you.

40:14.286 --> 40:15.413
Why are you smiling?

40:16.247 --> 40:17.415
Am I not allowed to?

40:31.637 --> 40:32.721
What…

40:33.556 --> 40:35.391
Come on.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.352
Seriously?

40:41.814 --> 40:43.691
The number is…

40:50.489 --> 40:52.741
Hello.
Your license plate number is 7193, right?

40:52.825 --> 40:54.410
Can you move your car for me?

40:58.414 --> 41:02.126
You parked your car like this
and went on a business trip?

41:04.712 --> 41:06.088
When will you be back?

41:18.434 --> 41:19.268
Wait!

41:19.977 --> 41:22.146
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.191
Did you run?

41:25.274 --> 41:27.067
Yes, from the subway station.

41:27.735 --> 41:30.029
Someone blocked my car.

41:30.738 --> 41:34.450
I see. But you're not late.

41:35.701 --> 41:37.745
I wanted you to have
a good impression of me.

41:37.828 --> 41:40.706
I'm not that strict.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.585
How was the scolding yesterday?

41:45.878 --> 41:48.756
It would've been better
if they actually scolded me.

41:48.839 --> 41:51.008
By the way, thanks for yesterday.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.552
It was nice. I got to go for a drive.

41:53.636 --> 41:54.887
I'll treat you to a meal.

41:54.970 --> 41:55.971
I'd love that.

42:21.789 --> 42:24.959
JIN-SEOK

42:56.282 --> 42:57.533
Did you skip golfing?

43:03.038 --> 43:04.707
Can our actors still work with you?

43:06.417 --> 43:07.668
You came to ask me that?

43:07.751 --> 43:09.712
At least finish what you're working on.

43:15.759 --> 43:17.636
You're a great agency CEO.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.389
Also, try to reconsider.
Don't be emotional.

43:20.472 --> 43:23.934
I was always emotional.
I'm finally starting to think rationally.

43:24.643 --> 43:27.021
I'll continue working with the three
until their shoot ends.

43:27.104 --> 43:29.273
Don't worry, and go. I need to sleep.

43:29.857 --> 43:30.733
Let's eat first.

43:32.359 --> 43:35.696
Will you please stop?
You're making me waver.

43:35.779 --> 43:38.032
Just eat. You need to eat to stay healthy.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.284
What's the point?
We're all going to die anyway.

43:40.868 --> 43:42.119
Stop talking that way.

43:42.202 --> 43:43.162
Whatever.

43:44.788 --> 43:45.789
Just go.

43:51.003 --> 43:52.129
Aren't you going?

43:57.676 --> 43:58.594
Get in.

43:59.303 --> 44:00.971
Looking like this? Seriously?

44:01.597 --> 44:04.350
That's the best you've looked lately.

44:10.064 --> 44:10.898
I'm not eating.

44:10.981 --> 44:13.942
I won't say anything. I promise.

44:15.319 --> 44:17.029
Just eat and go back to sleep.

44:17.112 --> 44:18.530
Do it for me. I'm hungry.

44:26.330 --> 44:29.708
This meal is way too fancy
for someone who just woke up.

44:33.337 --> 44:35.297
I won't bother you.

44:35.381 --> 44:37.007
I won't give you false hope.

44:37.091 --> 44:40.427
But to me,
you'll always be Mi-jo's best friend.

44:40.511 --> 44:42.054
So we can't just cut ties.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.224
You're indecisive with everything

44:45.307 --> 44:47.267
except for two things.

44:47.351 --> 44:48.185
What are they?

44:48.852 --> 44:49.853
Managing actors

44:49.937 --> 44:51.897
and making sure I stay in your life.

44:56.443 --> 44:57.361
Just eat.

44:58.654 --> 45:01.573
-The porridge is easy on the stomach.
-You need to go easy on me.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.660
You never listen to me,

45:05.327 --> 45:06.995
and it stresses me out so much.

45:28.142 --> 45:29.935
CAR RENTAL

45:31.812 --> 45:32.729
Come in.

45:35.441 --> 45:37.943
I think we should separate our patients.

45:38.026 --> 45:40.112
Okay, I'll take that. I see.

45:45.492 --> 45:46.535
Are you renting a car?

45:48.287 --> 45:53.459
I'm going to Gapyeong tonight
with my sister to eat dumpling soup,

45:53.542 --> 45:55.043
but my car is still blocked.

45:55.127 --> 45:56.920
That guy still isn't back?

45:57.004 --> 45:58.464
He's on a business trip.

45:58.547 --> 45:59.506
My gosh.

46:00.215 --> 46:02.676
You're going all the way
to Gapyeong for dumpling soup?

46:02.759 --> 46:04.761
My little sister loves dumplings.

46:04.845 --> 46:08.348
Goodness, you're very sweet.

46:09.057 --> 46:12.352
Hey, you can use my car.
Don't worry about the insurance.

46:13.020 --> 46:15.272
It's okay. I'll just rent a car.

46:15.355 --> 46:17.608
You drove me yesterday,
so I'm paying you back.

46:17.691 --> 46:20.235
Just park the car
in the clinic parking lot after.

46:22.196 --> 46:24.615
Then I guess
I should thank you in advance.

46:25.157 --> 46:26.867
Like I said, I'm paying you back.

46:26.950 --> 46:27.951
Thank you.

46:34.833 --> 46:36.919
RACHMANINOV: PIANO CONCERTO

46:53.936 --> 46:54.770
So-won.

46:55.437 --> 46:58.106
What? Seon-u, did you get a new car?

46:58.190 --> 47:00.275
No, I borrowed it. Get in.

47:02.319 --> 47:03.153
Did yours break down?

47:03.237 --> 47:05.155
No, it's a long story. Let's get going.

47:05.739 --> 47:06.949
-Ready?
-Yes.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.039
Nice music, right?

47:14.122 --> 47:15.582
Rachmaninoff again?

47:16.208 --> 47:18.168
It's the car owner's playlist.

47:18.252 --> 47:19.503
Isn't it nice?

47:20.087 --> 47:21.713
I'm sick of Rachmaninoff now.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.050
But not dumplings, right?

47:25.133 --> 47:26.176
I love them.

47:33.892 --> 47:35.394
I got a job.

47:35.477 --> 47:36.812
Really? At a hospital?

47:36.895 --> 47:38.772
At a dermatology clinic in Gangnam.

47:38.855 --> 47:40.274
Hey, that's great.

47:40.941 --> 47:42.859
How is it there? Do you like it?

47:42.943 --> 47:44.403
Everyone's really nice.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.781
Is your roommate okay?

47:49.283 --> 47:50.742
Yes. Very kind.

47:51.493 --> 47:52.995
Let me buy you guys a meal.

47:53.078 --> 47:54.538
-She's your friend--
-No.

47:55.414 --> 47:56.999
I'm doing fine, Seon-u.

47:57.082 --> 47:59.126
You're making me
feel like I'm being watched.

47:59.793 --> 48:01.545
Really? I'm sorry.

48:06.300 --> 48:07.509
Does Father know?

48:08.302 --> 48:09.136
Know what?

48:09.720 --> 48:10.804
That we hang out like this.

48:12.639 --> 48:14.808
What kind of question is that?

48:14.891 --> 48:17.978
What's wrong with two siblings eating
and watching shows together?

48:18.061 --> 48:19.146
It's natural.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.775
But I'm no longer your little sister.

48:36.997 --> 48:39.458
You will always be my little sister.

48:40.876 --> 48:42.586
I remember everything about you

48:42.669 --> 48:45.964
from when you were little until now.

48:48.842 --> 48:51.011
You came to Korea
because of me, didn't you?

48:54.473 --> 48:57.142
I was tired of my job in the States too.

48:58.977 --> 49:01.063
I wish Mom were still alive.

49:05.359 --> 49:07.736
I dream about her a lot these days.

49:11.031 --> 49:12.741
Don't you miss her too?

49:16.912 --> 49:18.121
I miss her too.

49:23.669 --> 49:26.421
Next time, we should go
to an observatory in Yeongwol.

49:26.505 --> 49:28.674
I heard the stars
look beautiful from there.

49:28.757 --> 49:31.843
No. I'm going to be a bit busy now.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.261
Are you trying to get rich?

49:34.137 --> 49:35.931
Is the piano academy keeping you busy?

49:36.431 --> 49:38.016
Yes, I'm tutoring for a competition.

49:38.100 --> 49:40.644
I see. Okay.

49:40.727 --> 49:43.313
Then let's just eat
something nice near the academy.

49:43.397 --> 49:44.815
It's in Banpo, right?

49:44.898 --> 49:46.983
No, I'll just go to your clinic.

49:48.985 --> 49:50.487
Sure, that'd be nice.

49:52.155 --> 49:53.532
-Eat up.
-Okay.

49:58.912 --> 50:01.373
Seon-u, drop me off over there.

50:01.456 --> 50:03.166
No, I'll drive you home.

50:03.250 --> 50:05.627
No, I have to meet someone.
I'll just get out there.

50:07.295 --> 50:08.296
Okay, then.

50:14.511 --> 50:15.887
-Seon-u.
-Yes?

50:17.264 --> 50:18.181
Thank you.

50:18.265 --> 50:20.100
Stop it. Don't be gross.

50:20.183 --> 50:21.560
I just wanted to thank you.

50:22.436 --> 50:23.520
See you.

50:25.105 --> 50:26.273
Take care!

51:15.113 --> 51:16.573
You're still here?

51:16.656 --> 51:17.908
I practiced putting.

51:17.991 --> 51:19.451
I see.

51:20.494 --> 51:22.287
Did you enjoy the meal?

51:23.497 --> 51:24.539
Well, yes.

51:27.626 --> 51:28.919
Would you like some wine?

51:31.338 --> 51:34.925
Don't tell my sister. I hid this from her.

51:37.052 --> 51:40.222
I have a lot to thank you for today.
For both the car and wine.

51:40.972 --> 51:42.891
I actually wanted to drink today.

51:43.892 --> 51:47.145
I could tell. You seemed a little down.

51:47.979 --> 51:49.397
Did you fight with your sister?

51:50.816 --> 51:52.108
That would've been better.

51:58.156 --> 51:59.157
This is nice.

52:01.076 --> 52:03.578
After I came to Korea
and studied for the KMLE,

52:03.662 --> 52:05.163
I was mostly alone.

52:07.916 --> 52:10.335
I bet I've looked like this pretty often.

52:11.378 --> 52:14.673
It's nice to have someone who notices it.

52:15.674 --> 52:19.302
Is there something
that often brings you down?

52:25.016 --> 52:26.059
My little sister…

52:28.728 --> 52:29.729
ran away from home.

52:32.107 --> 52:33.817
She suddenly came to Korea.

52:35.235 --> 52:36.194
Is that why…

52:36.945 --> 52:38.989
That's why I came to Korea,

52:39.781 --> 52:42.951
took the KMLE, and got a job here.

52:46.162 --> 52:47.873
Her name is So-won.

52:50.250 --> 52:52.210
I like her a lot.

52:53.211 --> 52:54.796
But suddenly, she changed.

52:56.548 --> 52:59.384
I think she started to lose her way

52:59.467 --> 53:02.053
after our mother passed away.

53:03.930 --> 53:04.931
I think…

53:07.058 --> 53:08.810
I would feel the same way.

53:10.145 --> 53:11.980
If my mom were gone,

53:13.398 --> 53:15.650
I'd probably lose my way too.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.487
But you'd still have
your father and sister.

53:21.489 --> 53:22.490
That's true.

53:23.617 --> 53:25.076
I'd feel lost for a while

53:25.994 --> 53:28.038
but slowly find my way back.

53:31.583 --> 53:32.792
My sister…

53:35.962 --> 53:38.506
seems to be having
a hard time finding her way back.

53:43.678 --> 53:46.389
She was adopted,
but she no longer wants to be

53:48.058 --> 53:49.893
a member of our family.

54:00.654 --> 54:05.158
So that's what you meant when you said
there was something you had to do here.

54:18.254 --> 54:20.090
There's this feeling…

54:22.384 --> 54:23.677
that's always inside me.

54:24.552 --> 54:28.723
Everyone in my family is kind to me,
and I also live a hard-working life.

54:30.016 --> 54:32.310
But deep down inside,

54:34.312 --> 54:36.064
I always feel anxious…

54:39.109 --> 54:40.276
because I was adopted.

54:42.570 --> 54:43.822
Your sister

54:44.948 --> 54:47.951
probably feels something similar.

54:48.493 --> 54:52.956
So it might be her way of rebelling.

54:57.877 --> 54:58.712
Thank you.

54:59.379 --> 55:00.255
For what?

55:00.338 --> 55:02.173
I'm sure it wasn't easy to tell me that.

55:03.341 --> 55:05.760
Thank you for sharing it with me.

55:10.765 --> 55:12.100
Gosh, I was feeling

55:12.976 --> 55:14.477
really depressed today.

55:14.561 --> 55:17.313
But you really cheered me up.

55:17.397 --> 55:18.231
Well…

55:19.566 --> 55:20.567
You know…

55:21.985 --> 55:23.445
I felt bad

55:25.155 --> 55:27.490
that I called us an accident.

55:32.495 --> 55:33.580
You see,

55:34.289 --> 55:36.750
I'm not used to

55:37.292 --> 55:41.004
telling people about myself like this.

55:41.546 --> 55:42.922
I've actually never done this.

55:44.549 --> 55:48.887
But for some reason,
I find myself telling you everything.

55:51.723 --> 55:53.767
I felt that way from the start.

55:55.643 --> 55:58.188
I think it was because
you told me that your sister…

55:59.773 --> 56:00.899
was adopted from Onnuri.

56:02.317 --> 56:05.904
And you seemed like a good guy,

56:07.197 --> 56:08.323
which was probably why

56:10.408 --> 56:11.409
that happened…

56:14.412 --> 56:16.122
that day…

56:16.790 --> 56:20.043
Anyway, what I want to say is
that it wasn't an accident.

56:25.799 --> 56:29.427
In my case, it was the moment
I saw you in front of the flower shop.

56:30.637 --> 56:33.056
When I saw you there
with peonies in your hands,

56:34.516 --> 56:36.017
I wanted to take you with me.

56:41.689 --> 56:42.649
Seriously?

56:43.316 --> 56:45.485
-You sound like a playboy.
-No, I mean…

56:45.568 --> 56:47.821
Weird, right?
I felt that the moment I saw you.

56:47.904 --> 56:49.155
Do you do this often?

56:49.239 --> 56:51.783
No. I was really shocked.

56:51.866 --> 56:54.285
I couldn't believe what I was saying.

56:54.369 --> 56:55.954
I was worried I might get slapped.

56:56.037 --> 56:57.163
-I was so nervous.
-Maybe…

56:57.247 --> 56:59.082
Maybe I should've slapped you.

57:02.585 --> 57:04.295
Anyway, I must say,

57:05.380 --> 57:07.006
it was a very odd day.

57:18.059 --> 57:19.060
Just a second.

57:23.940 --> 57:24.941
Hey.

57:27.152 --> 57:28.403
Nothing much.

57:30.447 --> 57:31.281
Again?

57:36.995 --> 57:41.708
How should I put it?
You look really awkward.

57:41.791 --> 57:45.128
You're not good at sports.

57:45.211 --> 57:47.255
-Don't I look cool?
-How exactly?

57:47.338 --> 57:48.923
I was a track athlete
in elementary school.

57:50.049 --> 57:51.468
That's irrelevant.

57:51.551 --> 57:53.553
I'm saying I'm good at sports.

57:53.636 --> 57:55.805
I'm serious. You look weird.

57:56.431 --> 57:58.975
But is this supposed to be fun?

57:59.058 --> 58:01.519
This is just unfair.

58:02.103 --> 58:04.647
I can't believe you're the ones

58:04.731 --> 58:07.775
who are always waiting for me
in front of my house.

58:07.859 --> 58:10.069
Why? Were you hoping to see Seon-u?

58:11.070 --> 58:13.156
It looks like you already drank a bit.

58:13.781 --> 58:15.617
Yes. At the clinic.

58:15.700 --> 58:17.243
What? Alone?

58:18.119 --> 58:19.037
Goodness.

58:19.120 --> 58:20.872
I have a feeling she wasn't alone.

58:21.873 --> 58:24.083
-Was it with…
-Mi-hyeon?

58:25.001 --> 58:28.755
Why would I drink
with my sister after work?

58:28.838 --> 58:30.673
But you didn't drink alone.

58:31.674 --> 58:33.009
Was it with Kim Seon-u?

58:33.092 --> 58:35.261
We just drank a little bit.

58:35.345 --> 58:37.263
My gosh.

58:37.347 --> 58:40.183
You two are unbelievable.

58:40.266 --> 58:43.520
-What?
-You two doctors are wild.

58:44.354 --> 58:46.356
What are you imagining?

58:46.439 --> 58:50.235
You know what?
The sofa in the lobby is pretty big.

58:50.318 --> 58:52.153
-My gosh.
-Gosh, I just pictured it.

58:52.237 --> 58:54.405
Are you crazy?

58:54.489 --> 58:56.157
The first time is always hard,

58:56.241 --> 58:59.118
but it gets easier
after a couple more times.

58:59.202 --> 59:01.037
-Goodness.
-Unbelievable.

59:01.120 --> 59:03.540
You embarrass me.

59:05.250 --> 59:06.709
WATCH
DID YOU GET HOME SAFELY?

59:17.095 --> 59:18.388
-Show us.
-Why?

59:18.471 --> 59:20.348
There are no secrets between us.

59:20.431 --> 59:21.558
What about my privacy?

59:21.641 --> 59:23.101
You have none.

59:23.184 --> 59:24.310
Show us.

59:24.394 --> 59:27.272
-Come on. Show us.
-Hey.

59:27.355 --> 59:29.274
-It's unlocked.
-Hey!

59:29.357 --> 59:31.359
-Hey!
-Is it from Kim Seon-u?

59:31.442 --> 59:32.652
"Did you get home safely?"

59:32.735 --> 59:35.238
"Thank you for the car and the wine."

59:36.906 --> 59:38.157
What? That's it?

59:38.241 --> 59:39.242
Yes.

59:39.325 --> 59:40.368
I said nothing happened.

59:40.451 --> 59:42.245
Be honest.

59:42.996 --> 59:45.290
-Are you a little disappointed?
-No.

59:45.373 --> 59:46.791
Are you going to text him back?

59:48.459 --> 59:49.711
-Of course.
-Right?

59:49.794 --> 59:50.920
-Hey!
-Let me.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.631
-Hey, stop it!
-I'll do it.

59:53.715 --> 59:55.174
-Hey, stop.
-Hello?

59:55.258 --> 59:56.551
Are you nuts?

59:58.136 --> 59:59.804
You're out of your mind.

1:00:02.932 --> 1:00:05.727
-He's calling.
-He's calling you.

1:00:06.894 --> 1:00:07.812
He's calling.

1:00:07.895 --> 1:00:10.023
-He's calling you. Pick up.
-Go on.

1:00:10.523 --> 1:00:12.567
-It's okay.
-Pick up.

1:00:12.650 --> 1:00:14.569
-Be quiet.
-We will.

1:00:18.156 --> 1:00:19.240
Hello?

1:00:20.825 --> 1:00:22.327
Did you get home safely?

1:00:23.911 --> 1:00:28.249
I was going to text you back,

1:00:28.333 --> 1:00:30.501
but I accidentally called you.

1:00:31.044 --> 1:00:33.504
Yes. I'm home.

1:00:33.588 --> 1:00:37.258
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow at the clinic.

1:00:37.342 --> 1:00:38.301
Bye.

1:00:49.312 --> 1:00:50.146
It wasn't me.

1:00:51.939 --> 1:00:53.441
<i>You know it wasn't me, right?</i>

1:00:53.524 --> 1:00:54.942
Cell phones have really good

1:00:55.026 --> 1:00:56.903
-<i>Oh, dear.</i>
-sound quality these days.

1:00:56.986 --> 1:00:58.780
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

1:00:58.863 --> 1:01:00.573
Well, I want to believe you.

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:02.450
But I'm having second thoughts.

1:01:02.533 --> 1:01:03.868
<i>I'll explain tomorrow.</i>

1:01:03.951 --> 1:01:05.453
<i>-See you tomorrow.
-Explain what?</i>

1:01:05.536 --> 1:01:06.621
Have a relieving night.

1:01:06.704 --> 1:01:07.789
<i>I swear it wasn't me.</i>

1:01:12.877 --> 1:01:14.462
She didn't use honorifics.

1:01:19.008 --> 1:01:20.009
Come in.

1:01:27.725 --> 1:01:29.435
I figured

1:01:29.519 --> 1:01:31.145
you might laugh.

1:01:31.229 --> 1:01:33.022
So let me explain.

1:01:33.106 --> 1:01:34.190
Here.

1:01:36.734 --> 1:01:38.653
You mean how you said, "It wasn't me"?

1:01:39.362 --> 1:01:41.781
I forgot to use honorifics
because I was flustered.

1:01:41.864 --> 1:01:43.366
It was friendly. I liked it.

1:01:44.033 --> 1:01:46.327
No, I'm serious. It wasn't me.

1:01:46.411 --> 1:01:48.121
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

1:01:48.204 --> 1:01:50.123
No, it really wasn't me.

1:01:50.206 --> 1:01:51.749
Gosh. Come in.

1:01:52.875 --> 1:01:54.627
You're both here.

1:01:54.711 --> 1:01:56.796
How about a welcome dinner
for Dr. Kim tonight?

1:01:56.879 --> 1:01:58.214
I'd love that.

1:01:59.549 --> 1:02:01.801
-How about you, Dr. Cha?
-I have plans.

1:02:01.884 --> 1:02:04.011
With the duo
who also couldn't get married?

1:02:04.095 --> 1:02:07.056
We chose not to get married.
It was by choice.

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:09.475
Sure. Whatever you say.

1:02:09.559 --> 1:02:11.477
I'll see you both at dinner then.

1:02:11.561 --> 1:02:14.564
Why did she even ask
if she was going to force me to go?

1:02:17.483 --> 1:02:19.986
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1:02:20.069 --> 1:02:21.821
-Welcome.
-Are we going to have

1:02:21.904 --> 1:02:23.906
a goodbye party for Dr. Cha too?

1:02:23.990 --> 1:02:25.199
This can't be it, right?

1:02:25.825 --> 1:02:28.661
I hear that all of you
are happy about Dr. Cha's sabbatical.

1:02:28.745 --> 1:02:30.371
-Gosh.
-Does it show, Ms. Cha?

1:02:30.455 --> 1:02:32.623
Totally.
Even more, now that Dr. Kim is here.

1:02:32.707 --> 1:02:35.293
Come on.
We're not disloyal like that, Ms. Cha.

1:02:35.376 --> 1:02:36.419
-She's right.
-Right.

1:02:36.502 --> 1:02:38.796
You guys rarely make coffee for me,

1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:41.549
but I noticed you guys
always make some for Dr. Kim.

1:02:41.632 --> 1:02:42.800
I'm hurt.

1:02:42.884 --> 1:02:45.261
I told you guys not to be too obvious.

1:02:45.845 --> 1:02:46.888
She's upset now.

1:02:46.971 --> 1:02:49.265
-We love you.
-We love you, Dr. Cha.

1:02:49.348 --> 1:02:50.975
-We mean it.
-Forget it.

1:02:51.058 --> 1:02:52.685
Cheers.

1:02:52.769 --> 1:02:54.395
Don't drink alone.

1:02:54.479 --> 1:02:56.939
-Whatever.
-Come on.

1:02:57.023 --> 1:02:58.566
-She's sulking.
-Cheers.

1:02:59.275 --> 1:03:01.360
-Dr. Kim, don't drink by yourself.
-Come on.

1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:04.864
-Bye, Dr. Kim.
-Bye.

1:03:04.947 --> 1:03:06.824
-Goodbye.
-Come on.

1:03:06.908 --> 1:03:08.743
-I don't want to go.
-Go home safely.

1:03:08.826 --> 1:03:10.077
-Bye.
-Go home safely.

1:03:10.161 --> 1:03:11.412
Let's drink again.

1:03:11.496 --> 1:03:13.247
-Okay.
-Okay, sure.

1:03:13.331 --> 1:03:14.832
-Bye.
-Careful.

1:03:14.916 --> 1:03:16.334
Please take her home safely.

1:03:16.417 --> 1:03:18.503
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:03:18.586 --> 1:03:19.462
Goodbye.

1:03:19.545 --> 1:03:20.797
Let's have a goodbye party.

1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:22.882
-Don't forget, okay?
-See you tomorrow.

1:03:22.965 --> 1:03:24.801
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

1:03:26.636 --> 1:03:28.805
Dr. Kim, how are you going to go home?

1:03:33.184 --> 1:03:34.185
Come here.

1:03:34.268 --> 1:03:35.978
Where are we going?

1:03:40.024 --> 1:03:42.276
Do you not have peonies?

1:03:43.319 --> 1:03:45.696
Not many people buy them.

1:03:45.780 --> 1:03:46.948
Do you like peonies?

1:03:47.031 --> 1:03:48.115
Yes.

1:03:48.199 --> 1:03:50.409
Let's go already.
She needs to go home too.

1:03:50.493 --> 1:03:52.286
-She loves peonies.
-What's with you?

1:03:52.370 --> 1:03:54.664
-But you don't have any.
-I'm sorry.

1:03:54.747 --> 1:03:56.123
Let's just go.

1:03:57.416 --> 1:03:58.417
What a shame.

1:04:00.294 --> 1:04:03.297
The fact that you're trying to buy me
peonies at this hour makes me

1:04:03.381 --> 1:04:05.049
question your ulterior motives.

1:04:06.676 --> 1:04:09.136
That's ridiculous.
I don't have any ulterior motives.

1:04:09.762 --> 1:04:13.558
So let's go home already. I'm sleepy.

1:04:15.643 --> 1:04:18.521
Do you really have to go to the States?

1:04:22.942 --> 1:04:23.860
Yes.

1:04:28.614 --> 1:04:30.950
Can't you just…

1:04:32.326 --> 1:04:33.995
play golf here?

1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:39.208
Just work two days a week.
The rest, you can play golf.

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:42.044
That's five days a week
including the weekends.

1:04:42.837 --> 1:04:46.215
I'll play with you on the weekends.
I'm pretty good.

1:04:46.299 --> 1:04:48.467
I already have
many people I can play with.

1:04:50.177 --> 1:04:51.554
Your friends?

1:04:51.637 --> 1:04:53.848
No, not them. They don't play.

1:04:57.101 --> 1:04:59.478
Why do you have to go abroad to play golf?

1:04:59.562 --> 1:05:01.856
Are you trying
to become a professional golfer?

1:05:03.858 --> 1:05:06.402
Why does it sound like you're whining?

1:05:11.073 --> 1:05:12.783
Come on.

1:05:13.743 --> 1:05:16.037
Do you really not
get what I mean, Dr. Cha?

1:05:16.954 --> 1:05:18.623
Are you dumb?

1:05:18.706 --> 1:05:19.916
I'm not dumb.

1:05:19.999 --> 1:05:21.417
Yes, you are.

1:05:21.959 --> 1:05:23.419
How did you get into med school?

1:05:23.502 --> 1:05:25.171
You must be out of your mind.

1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:30.801
What I'm saying is my life
used to be so calm and quiet,

1:05:30.885 --> 1:05:32.428
-but you showed up,
-What?

1:05:32.511 --> 1:05:35.431
and now I'm completely into you!

1:05:37.808 --> 1:05:39.769
And this is how you tell me?

1:05:41.062 --> 1:05:43.606
Shouldn't you at least be calm about it?

1:05:43.689 --> 1:05:47.151
How can I be calm about it?
I haven't felt like this in ten years.

1:05:48.235 --> 1:05:50.237
But you're fleeing to the States.

1:05:51.197 --> 1:05:52.198
"Flee"?

1:05:53.074 --> 1:05:55.868
Yes. I don't know. I messed up, damn it.

1:05:59.997 --> 1:06:00.998
Gosh.

1:06:03.751 --> 1:06:04.752
What's going on?

1:06:06.754 --> 1:06:08.172
Am I the one who's drunk?

1:06:11.133 --> 1:06:12.426
What am I supposed to say?

1:06:16.555 --> 1:06:17.556
I…

1:06:19.183 --> 1:06:21.394
I just confessed my feelings for you.

1:06:25.898 --> 1:06:27.108
Is it okay…

1:06:28.859 --> 1:06:29.694
if I like you?

1:06:39.453 --> 1:06:42.164
You're coming back after a year.

1:06:42.248 --> 1:06:43.082
Right?

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:49.505
We're too drunk.

1:06:49.588 --> 1:06:51.382
We both drank way too much.

1:06:53.634 --> 1:06:55.720
I guess I'm a bit drunk.

1:06:57.555 --> 1:06:59.724
I'll ask you out again
after I get some sleep

1:07:01.142 --> 1:07:02.101
and sober up.

1:07:08.065 --> 1:07:09.191
What?

1:07:09.275 --> 1:07:10.526
Taxi.

1:07:12.028 --> 1:07:13.029
My gosh.

1:07:20.870 --> 1:07:23.080
He must've been out of his mind.

1:07:27.084 --> 1:07:29.670
Who confesses their feelings like that?

1:07:30.755 --> 1:07:34.467
Where did it all go wrong?
I can't believe I said it like that.

1:07:39.138 --> 1:07:40.097
Gosh. Whatever.

1:07:54.904 --> 1:07:57.907
I woke up early at dawn

1:07:57.990 --> 1:08:00.242
and went to the flower market
in Yangjae-dong.

1:08:02.870 --> 1:08:08.334
I didn't expect you
to go this far to apologize.

1:08:08.417 --> 1:08:09.627
I'm a bit taken aback.

1:08:10.628 --> 1:08:12.630
I didn't get those to apologize.

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:23.390
It's to finish the confession
I started yesterday.

1:08:28.145 --> 1:08:29.313
Have a good day.

1:08:36.112 --> 1:08:38.823
He's so incoherent.

1:08:59.468 --> 1:09:00.553
Hey.

1:09:01.929 --> 1:09:04.390
Yes. I'm about to start work.

1:09:06.142 --> 1:09:08.602
Really? The results came out fast.

1:09:09.979 --> 1:09:10.813
Yes.

1:09:15.276 --> 1:09:16.277
Okay.

1:09:20.906 --> 1:09:22.366
What do you mean?

1:09:35.796 --> 1:09:37.673
Dr. Cha, what's wrong?

1:09:37.756 --> 1:09:40.801
I don't think I can treat patients today.

1:09:40.885 --> 1:09:43.220
Please take care of them for me.

1:09:43.304 --> 1:09:44.388
Okay.

1:09:45.472 --> 1:09:46.849
Dr. Cha.

1:10:01.197 --> 1:10:04.617
I think she was worried
when she got the sonogram results.

1:10:05.117 --> 1:10:06.744
She even took a CT scan.

1:10:07.244 --> 1:10:08.454
Didn't she tell you?

1:10:09.663 --> 1:10:10.748
No, she didn't.

1:10:11.457 --> 1:10:13.417
She'll need to take a test to be sure,

1:10:14.376 --> 1:10:15.794
but I think it's stage four.

1:10:15.878 --> 1:10:17.880
You can't tell just by the CT scan.

1:10:17.963 --> 1:10:20.382
I've seen this in one of my patients.

1:10:20.466 --> 1:10:21.759
Bring her here.

1:10:21.842 --> 1:10:24.261
She needs to get a PET scan
to see if it has spread.

1:10:25.971 --> 1:10:27.723
Are you sure this is the right one?

1:10:27.806 --> 1:10:29.475
Are you sure it's hers?

1:10:30.476 --> 1:10:31.560
Mi-jo.

1:10:39.985 --> 1:10:43.405
How the hell could she
not have known until now?

1:10:45.074 --> 1:10:46.825
Damn it.

1:11:02.007 --> 1:11:04.593
PEONY

1:11:12.059 --> 1:11:14.937
<i>The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable…</i>

1:11:20.859 --> 1:11:21.860
Come in.

1:11:24.196 --> 1:11:25.698
How is Dr. Cha?

1:11:25.781 --> 1:11:27.199
She won't pick up.

1:11:29.076 --> 1:11:30.536
This has never happened before.

1:11:56.437 --> 1:11:57.563
JIN-SEOK

1:11:59.023 --> 1:12:00.024
Hey, Jin-seok.

1:12:00.524 --> 1:12:01.525
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

1:12:02.735 --> 1:12:03.861
Oh, right.

1:12:04.653 --> 1:12:05.738
<i>You forgot?</i>

1:12:06.613 --> 1:12:08.699
I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

1:12:08.782 --> 1:12:11.952
<i>Then just come to my office.
We can drink someplace nearby.</i>

1:12:12.036 --> 1:12:12.870
Okay.

1:13:04.671 --> 1:13:05.631
CEO KIM JIN-SEOK

1:13:05.714 --> 1:13:06.757
Is Mi-jo nice to you?

1:13:08.300 --> 1:13:09.635
Yes, she's really kind.

1:13:09.718 --> 1:13:11.887
Are you sure?
I bet you're the one who's nice.

1:13:12.888 --> 1:13:14.056
Right?

1:13:16.517 --> 1:13:18.227
Mi-jo, what…

1:13:19.770 --> 1:13:21.480
I'll kill you.

1:13:25.776 --> 1:13:26.735
You!

1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:29.780
I'll kill you!

1:13:31.532 --> 1:13:32.908
Kim Jin-seok…

1:13:34.618 --> 1:13:36.203
You jerk!

1:13:37.538 --> 1:13:39.289
Mi-jo, what's wrong?

1:13:42.418 --> 1:13:45.212
I'm going to kill you.

1:14:38.056 --> 1:14:39.057
<i>I don't know</i>

1:14:39.975 --> 1:14:44.062
<i>why I ran over to see Jin-seok
instead of Chan-young that day.</i>

1:14:46.106 --> 1:14:47.733
It's your fault.

1:14:49.109 --> 1:14:50.527
It's all because of you.

1:14:51.945 --> 1:14:53.489
It's your fault,

1:14:54.781 --> 1:14:56.283
and it's my fault too.

1:14:59.203 --> 1:15:01.205
It's all because of us.

1:15:04.583 --> 1:15:05.626
Mi-jo, what…

1:16:11.108 --> 1:16:12.109
<i>And that day…</i>

1:16:15.195 --> 1:16:16.613
<i>when everything felt hopeless,</i>

1:16:20.367 --> 1:16:21.952
<i>the touch of his hand…</i>

1:16:24.496 --> 1:16:25.872
<i>felt so warm.</i>

1:17:03.285 --> 1:17:04.578
<i>Twenty-nine.</i>

1:17:04.661 --> 1:17:06.288
<i>What did you like at that age?</i>

1:17:07.164 --> 1:17:08.332
<i>My friends.</i>

1:17:09.499 --> 1:17:10.334
<i>Let's run.</i>

1:17:12.419 --> 1:17:15.380
I had no idea what to say to her.

1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:20.385
When I share my troubles
with someone unrelated…

1:17:20.469 --> 1:17:21.511
It helps lift a burden off my chest.

1:17:22.179 --> 1:17:23.930
<i>What he and I have…</i>

1:17:25.849 --> 1:17:27.684
is not what you think.

1:17:27.768 --> 1:17:29.311
Won't you be embarrassed when you die?

1:17:30.604 --> 1:17:31.813
I guess it's bad.

1:17:32.439 --> 1:17:34.691
We're still in our thirties.

1:17:34.775 --> 1:17:36.818
<i>We still have so much left to enjoy.</i>

1:17:39.571 --> 1:17:44.368
