00:18.947 --> 00:20.471
It's alive!

00:45.740 --> 00:46.764
Aww, you idiot...

00:48.710 --> 00:50.405
# Let's go nerds #

00:54.416 --> 00:56.247
Yeah!

00:56.318 --> 00:57.216
Oh man,

00:57.285 --> 00:59.651
someone put Liquid Heat in our
jock straps.

00:59.721 --> 01:00.915
Oh, it burns!

01:02.824 --> 01:05.793
Wow, Stan,
you were wonderful.

01:07.128 --> 01:08.152
You're that nerd!

01:09.130 --> 01:10.961
Gentlemen,
you have been convicted of

01:11.032 --> 01:13.830
illegal surveillance,
invasion of privacy,

01:13.902 --> 01:17.565
multiple counts of assault,
identity theft, and rape.

01:17.639 --> 01:19.834
You are each order to serve
not less than

01:19.908 --> 01:23.207
44 years in
maximum security prison!

01:25.113 --> 01:25.977
Ow!

01:27.916 --> 01:29.611
Nerds!

01:29.684 --> 01:31.845
Are you guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

01:31.920 --> 01:35.117
That this is the best day of my
entire life?

01:35.190 --> 01:38.557
No, we've got to reach out to
them.

01:38.626 --> 01:40.856
And that's how chemistry works.

01:40.929 --> 01:43.693
See, it really isn't so hard.

01:43.765 --> 01:45.528
Yo, I'm sorry for calling
you a nerd.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.295
Change my life, dawg!

01:47.369 --> 01:48.996
Learning is fun!

01:49.070 --> 01:50.697
I love learning!

01:50.772 --> 01:54.138
I've reached them.

02:01.916 --> 02:04.248
Conan, what is best in life?

02:05.754 --> 02:09.190
# What is best in life #

02:09.257 --> 02:12.715
# That is hard to say #

02:12.794 --> 02:16.628
# For each man is unique #

02:16.698 --> 02:22.193
# In his own way #

02:22.270 --> 02:23.498
# As a boy #

02:23.571 --> 02:25.732
# I liked gum drops
and puppies #

02:25.807 --> 02:27.274
# Sailboats and frogs #

02:27.342 --> 02:33.212
# And my best friend little
Ricky Mabius #

02:33.281 --> 02:36.375
# But when I became
a young man #

02:36.451 --> 02:39.545
# What was best in life #

02:39.621 --> 02:44.888
# Began to change just
like my body #

02:44.959 --> 02:48.793
# I like pretty Stacy Lion
with the long blonde hair #

02:48.863 --> 02:52.424
# And eyes that were
blue as the ocean #

02:55.103 --> 02:57.162
# But now that I'm grown #

02:57.238 --> 02:59.399
# My thoughts have changed #

02:59.474 --> 03:03.410
# And it's pretty clear to me #

03:03.478 --> 03:07.915
# The answer to the question,
what is best life #

03:07.982 --> 03:11.816
# Is plain enough
for all to see #

03:11.886 --> 03:15.378
# Crush your enemies #
# Crush your enemies #

03:15.457 --> 03:19.086
# And see them driven
before you #

03:19.160 --> 03:22.687
# Crush your enemies #
# Crush your enemies #

03:22.764 --> 03:26.700
# And see them driven
before you #

03:28.236 --> 03:35.733
# And hear the lamentations
of the women #

03:42.684 --> 03:46.051
Did that blow your mind?
Huh?

03:51.459 --> 03:53.359
Welcome to
the Star Trek experience.

03:53.428 --> 03:55.225
Here in glamorous Las Vegas.

03:55.296 --> 03:56.126
One please.

03:56.197 --> 03:57.391
That will be $42.99.

03:57.465 --> 03:59.524
Holy crap is that
in space dollars?

04:00.535 --> 04:04.596
Excuse me, but there is no such
thing as space dollars.

04:04.672 --> 04:06.469
Perhaps you're referring to the
gold press latinum

04:06.541 --> 04:08.031
which is the unit of currency
commonly...

04:08.109 --> 04:09.736
Ow, my knee cap.

04:09.811 --> 04:11.403
So, $42.99.

04:11.479 --> 04:13.003
Welcome to the Enterprise.

04:13.081 --> 04:15.242
The Klingons have been sighted
in the area.

04:15.316 --> 04:19.047
Fear not my dear, the regulation
snugness of your uniform

04:19.120 --> 04:22.612
has my photon torpedo
in launch position!

04:23.892 --> 04:28.556
Ohhh!
Ugh!

04:28.630 --> 04:32.623
Oh, there's a hair trigger on
the firing mechanism.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.497
If you know what I mean.

04:34.569 --> 04:37.060
On my command, R2-D2.

04:37.138 --> 04:38.230
Argh.

04:38.306 --> 04:39.705
Fire lasers at Pluto!

04:39.774 --> 04:41.469
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

04:41.543 --> 04:43.875
What are you doing in my
bathroom?

04:44.846 --> 04:46.336
Ahh, jeez.

04:46.414 --> 04:47.540
Bridge to sanitation.

04:47.615 --> 04:50.516
Someone took a dump on the
captain's chair, again.

04:53.321 --> 04:54.151
Hey Eddie, look at this.

04:54.222 --> 04:56.713
Della Reese lost 5 pounds,
good for her.

04:56.791 --> 04:58.190
Hey you're not Eddie.

04:58.259 --> 04:59.988
You will be assimilated.

05:01.462 --> 05:02.429
Infantile.

05:02.497 --> 05:03.862
Attention Enterprise,

05:03.932 --> 05:05.695
you thought you were clever
hiding in this

05:05.767 --> 05:09.601
parallel dimension, but we have
finally found you.

05:09.671 --> 05:11.866
Prepare to be assimilated.

05:11.940 --> 05:12.964
Ah, is this in the script?

05:13.041 --> 05:15.475
I can't adlib man, I suck at
improv.

05:15.543 --> 05:17.272
Don't worry,
I was a groundling.

05:19.013 --> 05:21.208
My clean little hands...

05:21.282 --> 05:24.217
Now spread the flour, now shaky
shaky, shaky.

05:24.285 --> 05:25.445
What are you doing?

05:25.520 --> 05:28.045
Stir...

05:33.561 --> 05:35.324
What?
Another Enterprise?

05:35.396 --> 05:37.296
How can this be?

05:37.365 --> 05:39.629
Volgmor, return to the ship.

05:39.701 --> 05:43.330
Oh, cruel irony, this is right
out of my fan fic.

05:45.406 --> 05:47.203
Thank you parallel dimension
Enterprise.

05:47.275 --> 05:48.105
Yes sir!

05:48.176 --> 05:51.202
Oh, they're hot!
Chocolate chip cookie?

05:51.279 --> 05:53.179
L- I...
What?

05:55.550 --> 05:58.110
Uh, where am I?

05:58.186 --> 05:59.983
How'd I get up here?

06:00.054 --> 06:03.751
Are you guys SAG?
Hello!

06:03.825 --> 06:04.655
Hey what's on the menu today?

06:04.726 --> 06:06.523
I thought the inmates might like
a nice change of pace.

06:06.594 --> 06:09.961
Broccoli, baked beans, coffee
ice cream and Red Bull.

06:10.031 --> 06:10.861
Oh my god.

06:17.438 --> 06:19.065
Uh, I think I've had enough of
that show.

06:19.140 --> 06:19.970
Delete.

06:20.041 --> 06:21.269
Hey, what are you doing?

06:21.342 --> 06:23.139
I don't want Robot Chicken on
the DVR any more.

06:23.211 --> 06:24.803
No!
I love Robot Chicken!

06:24.879 --> 06:26.210
It's all farting and retards.

06:26.281 --> 06:27.111
Well I like it.

06:27.181 --> 06:28.011
Tough titty.

06:28.082 --> 06:29.174
Ass!
We split the cable bill!

06:29.250 --> 06:30.615
TV doesn't have to be stupid.

06:30.685 --> 06:32.277
It can be challenging...

06:32.353 --> 06:34.753
Oh yeah, you want something
brainy on the TV.

06:36.624 --> 06:38.057
Uh.

06:38.126 --> 06:40.890
Oh man, I ain't going to prison!

06:42.730 --> 06:46.029
Oh my god!
Gary! Enrique!

06:46.100 --> 06:48.534
Oh, I better call 911!

06:48.603 --> 06:50.093
But I might as well watch a
little Robot Chicken

06:50.171 --> 06:51.297
while I wait for the cops.

06:59.547 --> 07:01.344
Do you see the problem here?

07:01.416 --> 07:06.012
Yeah, that hallway is like
bizarrely huge!

07:06.087 --> 07:09.079
That was fantastic Dave, take 5
and we'll be right with you.

07:09.157 --> 07:10.055
Man, I wish it was better.

07:10.124 --> 07:11.216
Yeah, but it's not too much of a
problem

07:11.292 --> 07:12.850
I'll get Rosie in here to adjust
the levels and such.

07:12.927 --> 07:13.757
It will sound good.

07:13.828 --> 07:15.489
Hey did I tell you I took out
Rosie last Friday.

07:15.563 --> 07:16.825
Oh really? How'd it go?

07:16.898 --> 07:17.728
She got thirteen toes.

07:17.799 --> 07:18.629
What?

07:18.700 --> 07:19.530
Weird right?

07:19.600 --> 07:20.464
I took her to dinner and then
invited her back to my place

07:20.535 --> 07:22.560
thinking I'd get a little play
maybe a BJ or something.

07:22.637 --> 07:24.571
She said her feet were hurting
so I offer a massage

07:24.639 --> 07:26.664
you know, loosen her up a bit,
so I take her shoes off

07:26.741 --> 07:28.834
and bam, three extra digits
looking right at me.

07:28.910 --> 07:29.842
Ugh, what'd you do?

07:29.911 --> 07:31.003
Pulled out a knife
and cut 'em off.

07:31.079 --> 07:31.807
What?

07:31.879 --> 07:33.437
Ha, just kidding.
Naw I gave her the massage.

07:33.514 --> 07:34.344
And?

07:34.415 --> 07:35.473
She fell asleep, passed out
right there on the couch.

07:35.550 --> 07:36.380
What'd you do?

07:36.451 --> 07:37.281
Tucked her in,
let her sleep.

07:37.385 --> 07:38.215
That's it?

07:38.286 --> 07:39.685
Well first I undressed her and
took some pictures.

07:39.754 --> 07:41.016
Yeah, oh boy!

07:41.089 --> 07:42.113
Dude you got to let me see 'em.

07:42.190 --> 07:43.020
I'll show you right
when we're done.

07:43.091 --> 07:44.422
Ah cool,
then let's get this over with.

07:44.492 --> 07:46.153
I've been dying to see what
Rosie's been hiding

07:46.227 --> 07:48.252
under that hunting jacket.

07:48.329 --> 07:50.058
Huh, wonder where he went.

07:50.131 --> 07:51.598
Ah, probably just stepped
outside for some air.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.327
Let me see the pictures before
he comes back.

08:15.456 --> 08:16.718
Where are we?

08:16.791 --> 08:20.227
Chained up next to Slater,
this really is a torture chamber.

08:20.294 --> 08:21.693
Hey, where's Screech?

08:21.763 --> 08:23.856
All in due time children.

08:23.931 --> 08:25.023
You jerk wad!

08:25.099 --> 08:26.327
What did have you done
with our friend?

08:26.401 --> 08:28.232
If you really want to know...

08:29.604 --> 08:32.835
Look at me!
I'm Jesus!

08:32.907 --> 08:35.102
In that case, God should demand
a paternity test.

08:36.943 --> 08:37.967
Silence!

08:38.044 --> 08:40.605
In the center of the room is a
red button.

08:40.681 --> 08:44.879
Press it and Samuel Screech Powers
will be torn to pieces.

08:45.853 --> 08:47.115
Now why the heck
would we do that?

08:47.188 --> 08:50.521
Press the button and I let the
rest of you go free.

08:50.591 --> 08:52.957
That's an impossible choice.
You're sick!

08:53.027 --> 08:54.187
Sorry.

08:54.262 --> 08:56.093
It's kinda my only hobby.

08:56.164 --> 08:57.426
Wow that is devious.

08:57.498 --> 08:58.556
Kinda wish I thought of that.

08:59.934 --> 09:04.598
The game begins,
now!

09:04.672 --> 09:07.232
If we push the button
we all go free.

09:07.308 --> 09:09.333
Slater,
don't even think about it!

09:09.410 --> 09:12.038
Just press the button,
you're my best buds.

09:12.113 --> 09:13.341
Save yourselves!

09:13.414 --> 09:15.075
Oh, Screech!

09:15.149 --> 09:18.482
Forget it Screech,
all for one and one for all.

09:18.553 --> 09:20.783
Children I forgot to mention
something,

09:20.855 --> 09:24.689
if you press the button you also
get free Corvettes!

09:30.665 --> 09:32.132
What is happening?
Why isn't he dead yet?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.030
No!

09:33.100 --> 09:33.930
Work, damn it!

09:34.001 --> 09:34.831
Hang on!
Hang on!

09:34.902 --> 09:36.665
Stop hitting the button so hard.

09:36.737 --> 09:37.931
You're breaking it.

09:38.005 --> 09:38.835
Make it work.

09:38.906 --> 09:40.032
I hate you guys.

09:40.107 --> 09:43.804
I can't believe I masturbated to
Kelly and wanted bang Lisa.

09:43.878 --> 09:44.776
You suck!

09:44.846 --> 09:45.813
Yo, fuck the button

09:45.880 --> 09:48.178
just give me a blunt object,
I'll beat him to death!

09:48.249 --> 09:49.739
Stop! Stop!
Just-just stop!

09:49.817 --> 09:51.546
Stop!
Hey, hey, hey!

09:51.619 --> 09:53.143
Wait-wait, a minute.

09:53.221 --> 09:56.190
It's me.

09:56.257 --> 09:57.588
Principal Belding.

09:57.658 --> 10:02.027
You're not really prisoners,
this was just a trust exercise

10:02.096 --> 10:04.690
to help students to learn to
depend on each other.

10:05.666 --> 10:07.964
Ahhhh!

10:08.035 --> 10:09.502
Stop! Stop!

10:11.072 --> 10:12.061
Just slit his throat!

10:12.139 --> 10:13.436
Use my nail file!

10:13.508 --> 10:15.135
For the love of god!

10:16.277 --> 10:17.107
Yes Slater.

10:17.178 --> 10:18.770
So we really don't get
Corvettes?

10:18.846 --> 10:21.076
No.
Are there any other questions?

10:21.148 --> 10:21.978
Me, me, me, me!

10:22.049 --> 10:26.247
Are there any questions not
pertaining to Corvettes?

10:26.320 --> 10:27.514
Ahh, man.

10:27.588 --> 10:29.351
I fucking hate you guys.
