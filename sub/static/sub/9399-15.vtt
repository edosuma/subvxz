I know I sort of freaked you out
when you asked me to stay here

00:05.338 --> 00:07.932
and, well, there's a reason.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.670
- I'm a virgin.
- Really?

00:10.744 --> 00:13.406
Did someone call for a nanny?

00:13.480 --> 00:15.209
Grandma.

00:16.216 --> 00:21.017
I'll edit the book because I believe in it.
And I believe in you.

- But we can't be together.
- We will be.

00:27.494 --> 00:30.691
- Lucas?
- Every day.

00:32.598 --> 00:34.430
I've seen you, okay? Outside of the school.

00:34.501 --> 00:35.559
I've seen you driving past the house.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.227
And now you just happen
to be at the hospital?

00:37.303 --> 00:40.033
Nathan, stop.
I was just getting a check-up.

00:40.507 --> 00:45.171
- But the truth is, I was hoping...
- No, don't. Dan, don't hope. You hear me?

00:45.678 --> 00:47.703
There's no hope for you.

No, don't cry, baby girl, please.

01:23.049 --> 01:25.984
- Don't you wanna sleep?
- I do, Brooke.

01:26.052 --> 01:29.215
Okay, you know I love you, all right,
and I love baby Angie,

01:29.289 --> 01:31.723
but I also really, really love my sleep.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.952
And I haven't gotten any
in, like, three nights.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.654
Yeah, and it shows.

01:35.728 --> 01:39.186
Thanks. As if I didn't know I look
like Amy Winehouse, pre-rehab.

01:39.265 --> 01:44.225
Peyton, I'm sorry. Okay? She didn't come
with instructions but I will figure it out.

02:06.292 --> 02:09.591
How about, Brooke's boob? Huh?

02:18.771 --> 02:23.333
Hey. Hey. Look at the dancing animals,
aren't they funny? Hey!

02:25.778 --> 02:29.441
Oh, my God, did you think that was funny?
Look, look.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.082
No. Nobody likes that, remember?
It's funny.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.678
Brooke. Really?

02:43.329 --> 02:47.857
She's finally sleeping.
I think the crying wore her out.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.664
Hey, I'm sorry about
the stuffed animal thing.

02:50.737 --> 02:54.264
- I just... I was desperate.
- It's fine.

02:54.340 --> 02:58.709
But I mean, do you think Angie's illness
has something to do with her fussiness?

02:58.778 --> 02:59.836
It's not supposed to.

02:59.913 --> 03:03.849
Well, if I were having heart surgery,
I'm pretty sure I'd be a little fussy.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.077
Yeah, but the doctor said

03:05.151 --> 03:07.551
her heart condition
doesn't even really affect her now.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.747
It's just that
if she doesn't have the surgery,

03:09.822 --> 03:12.290
it'll cause big problems later.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.785
But now she's supposed
to be a regular little baby.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.957
Well, she is.
And regular little babies cry sometimes.

03:19.032 --> 03:24.402
Sometimes. Peyton, she cries all the time.
I feel like she doesn't like me.

03:24.470 --> 03:27.268
Oh, no. Come on.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.436

Dude, shut up
and how do you even know about that?

03:41.387 --> 03:42.411
Fergie.

03:42.488 --> 03:44.046
- How'd he know?
- Junk.

03:44.123 --> 03:46.819
Yeah, you know he tried
to get with her, right?

03:47.560 --> 03:51.052
I'm just playing, man. He overheard
you two talking the other night.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.654
You know these walls are thin.

03:52.732 --> 03:56.259
Well, I don't care that she's a virgin.
I actually think it's nice.

03:56.336 --> 03:58.304
Hey, there's something to be said for it.

03:58.371 --> 04:01.568
Knowing exactly where your girl
hasn't been. Or has been.

04:01.641 --> 04:05.077
That's not what I meant.
Millicent's just pretty amazing.

04:05.144 --> 04:07.009
Dude, you are so whipped.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.810
I mean, I probably would be, too,
considering that she 10 times hotter

04:09.882 --> 04:11.747
than that cougar you was chasing.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.945
So, I thought you guys
were gonna get it together.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.612
You know, maybe clean this place up

04:15.688 --> 04:18.281

- Somebody looks older today.
- I do.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.212
You? Why would that be?

04:44.284 --> 04:48.618
- It's my birthday, Mama.
- It is your birthday!

- I'm five.
- You're five?

- Oh, okay.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.632
- I want two things.
- Okay.

Grandpa Dan to come to my party.

a happy birthday.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.545
It's never gonna happen.

05:52.618 --> 05:55.314
Look, I knew I screwed up as a father,
but I'd like to be a good grandfather.

05:55.388 --> 05:59.484
Well, you should have thought of that
before you killed Jamie's great-uncle.

05:59.792 --> 06:04.024

fifth birthday today?

I wanna be doing, too.

- You know she's gonna be there.
- Yes, I know, Hales.

07:19.205 --> 07:22.470
You told me at least, like, six times.
I know Lindsey's gonna be at the party.

07:22.542 --> 07:27.002
I'm just saying, if it makes you
uncomfortable, I can ask her not to come.

07:27.079 --> 07:30.378
I know. I know, and I love you for it, Hales,
I do, but the way I see it,

07:30.450 --> 07:33.942
Lindsey knows I'm gonna be at the party
and she's choosing to come.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.820
Look, I told her that one day,
she's gonna come back to me.

somehow let my parents down.

- Busy.

is number two on iTunes?

08:52.899 --> 08:57.097
Yeah, I do, but you ain't on iTunes.
You cyber-stalking Lucas, right?

his Facebook profile about 50 times

Internet is a dangerous place.

09:08.981 --> 09:11.347

Well, I kind of need help

- Well, I would love to, but...
- No buts. 'Cause you ain't got one.

09:21.861 --> 09:24.625
Now, look,
I told Nathan I was going to get this Wii,

09:24.697 --> 09:28.428
but that's about as easy to find
as Willy Wonka's little golden ticket.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.492
So, we got our work cut out for us.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.198
- Oh. "Us," huh?
- Yeah. Us.

09:33.272 --> 09:34.796

pumpkin bread.

I thought it might make them
like me even more.

I don't think I've ever seen
the floor of this place.

09:51.357 --> 09:53.985
Did you know your couch was brown?

09:54.860 --> 09:57.624
Did they do this for me? Because
the last thing I want is to be a burden.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.393
No, no. We've been talking
about cleaning the place up for weeks.

10:00.466 --> 10:04.368

- Just boys becoming men.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.132
Well, it's kind of nice.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.637
Why don't we go out for lunch?

- Well, then we'll have a lot to eat later.

- I have a feeling I'm not gonna like this.

10:26.659 --> 10:29.025
Dan showed up at the gym.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.962
Don't you find it creepy that your dad
hangs out around the high school gym?

10:32.031 --> 10:34.226
He's Dan. It's all creepy.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.426
What did he want?

10:35.501 --> 10:38.026
He wanted an invite
to Jamie's birthday party.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.038
But don't worry,
I told him it's not gonna happen.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.506
Well, you're stronger than I am,
'cause Jamie's been asking me all week

10:42.575 --> 10:44.543
if his Grandpa Dan's gonna come
to his birthday party

10:44.610 --> 10:47.738
and I have been dodging the subject
altogether.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.509
- Excellent parenting.
- Yeah, thanks.

10:50.883 --> 10:53.044
I don't blame him for wanting
to get to know his grandpa.

10:53.119 --> 10:55.986
- I just wish his grandpa wasn't Dan.
- Me, too.

10:56.055 --> 10:58.922
- We just can't trust him.
- I know.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.960
- JAMIE: Who can't we trust?
- Hey, buddy.

11:03.095 --> 11:04.995
You excited for your birthday party today?

11:05.064 --> 11:07.931
You were talking
about Grandpa Dan, right?

11:09.235 --> 11:10.725
So can he come?

11:12.104 --> 11:16.370

is not gonna make it today, okay?

- I can't. It's not your fault.

27:11.429 --> 27:13.056
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

I just want to apologize
for what happened again at the wedding.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.069
Skills, it wasn't your fault.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.664
Yeah, I know, but you trusted me
and I let you guys down.

27:23.742 --> 27:26.540
Look, I know I should have went to
the bathroom with Jamie and I understand

27:26.611 --> 27:28.203
why you all don't want me
to baby-sit him no more.

27:28.279 --> 27:32.147
Oh, Antwon, that's not it.
It's more about us than it is you.

27:32.217 --> 27:33.946
To be honest, we've...

27:34.486 --> 27:36.977
We've been having a hard time
just trusting him with anyone lately.

27:37.055 --> 27:38.920
Yeah, but you know
I'd give my life for that boy.

27:38.990 --> 27:44.553
- We know that. Jamie's lucky to have you.
- So are we. I promise.

27:45.263 --> 27:49.165
Hey, guys. Jamie's chomping at the bit
to open his presents.
