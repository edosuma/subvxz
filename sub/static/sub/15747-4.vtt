WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:04.203
-<i> Previously on</i> The Strain...
- Where's Zack?

00:04.205 --> 00:06.939
- We want the<i> Lumen.</i>
You have a choice to make.

00:06.941 --> 00:09.975
The<i> Lumen</i> or Zack.
-<i> What did the Master</i>

00:09.977 --> 00:12.344
offer you for it?
- My son.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.880
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Take off the goddamn helmet.

00:14.882 --> 00:17.783
- OK.
- Go, Mama, go!

00:17.785 --> 00:21.186
- Seven bodies...
that makes two full sweep teams.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.056
- What's a sweep team?
- You shitheads just got conscripted.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.225
- That book is the answer
to both our problems.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.827
You will get your son back
and I will kill my father.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.796
- Send out my wife and son!

00:30.798 --> 00:35.534
Let me see his face.
(snarling)

00:35.536 --> 00:37.970
- Those are my Navy SEALs.
They've been turned.

00:43.343 --> 00:46.745
- Mr. Quinlan!
(screaming)

00:49.549 --> 00:52.718
(yelling)

01:07.000 --> 01:10.335
- Can you just... to the right?

01:10.337 --> 01:12.771
- OK, give me a sec here.
OK, how's that?

01:12.773 --> 01:15.541
- Would you put this on, please?
- Better, thanks.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.876
I only have a few minutes here.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.878
- Oh, of course.
- We can roll.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.881
- So how big's the team covering
what's going on here in the city?

01:22.883 --> 01:25.050
- You're looking at it.
Our New York bureau

01:25.052 --> 01:27.586
shut down three days ago.
My guys and me refused to leave.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.355
- All right, we're rolling.

01:30.357 --> 01:33.092
- Ms. Faraldo,
you've been leading

01:33.094 --> 01:35.727
the charge here in New York
City. But in the last few days,

01:35.729 --> 01:37.729
there's been a shift.
The<i> strigoi</i> --

01:37.731 --> 01:40.265
as some people are calling them
-- have taken ground from you

01:40.267 --> 01:42.968
in Harlem and parts
of the Bronx, Queens

01:42.970 --> 01:45.037
and Lower Manhattan.
According to reports,

01:45.039 --> 01:48.040
you're having trouble holding battle lines.
- Not true.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.976
We're making progress.
- Where are you making progress?

01:50.978 --> 01:52.978
- All throughout Manhattan --

01:52.980 --> 01:55.614
Upper and Lower --
Harlem, Queens.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.716
- I understand that in
Lower Manhattan, the fight

01:57.718 --> 02:00.552
isn't just being fought
by your own security forces.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.155
We have confirmed
reports that chain gangs

02:03.157 --> 02:06.158
of conscripted prisoners are
being forced into the fight.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.060
- What?
- How many of these

02:08.062 --> 02:09.895
chain gangs has the NYPD set up?

02:09.897 --> 02:12.564
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.433
- Are you familiar with
someone named Ben Greene?

02:14.435 --> 02:16.802
- Should I be?
- Ben was arrested

02:16.804 --> 02:19.104
for breaking curfew
and was denied due process.

02:19.106 --> 02:21.573
According to Ben's account,

02:21.575 --> 02:24.176
these chain gangs are comprised
of people who have committed

02:24.178 --> 02:26.745
any range of offenses.
And they're being forced

02:26.747 --> 02:28.747
to clear<i> strigoi</i>
from infected areas.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.617
Many go in, most don't survive.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.820
- Turn the camera off!
- Ben is 16.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.523
- You really think turning
people against our efforts

02:37.525 --> 02:40.792
is a good idea right now?
We're hanging by a thread!

02:40.794 --> 02:43.929
- The citizens have a right to know
what's going on! - Turn the camera off!

02:43.931 --> 02:46.498
What are you doing here?

02:46.500 --> 02:49.001
- Documenting
the fall of New York.

02:51.971 --> 02:55.340
- Get these assholes
out of my office.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.576
(theme music)

03:50.196 --> 03:52.531
- Two things about your great
plan that didn't work out.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.033
One: you didn't die.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.604
You know, that whole myth

03:58.606 --> 04:02.174
that "he dies, you die,"

04:02.176 --> 04:05.077
that never really
made sense to me.

04:05.079 --> 04:08.547
Although neither does how fast
you appear to be healing.

04:08.549 --> 04:13.185
And, uh, two...

04:13.187 --> 04:16.255
I don't have my son back.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.258
That was kind of a big part
of the plan for me.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.194
So congrats on
chopping your Dad's head off

04:22.196 --> 04:26.531
and sorry your suicide mission
didn't really work out.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.268
And, uh...

04:31.204 --> 04:36.141
...thanks for leaving me
here with nothing.

04:39.879 --> 04:42.314
- It's been a long
night, Professor.

04:42.316 --> 04:46.151
Come on, take a load off. Sit.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.722
- I cannot sit
at a time like this.

04:50.724 --> 04:54.092
I have worked my whole life
towards this end.

04:54.094 --> 04:57.129
- Ah. We killed
the Master, right?

04:57.131 --> 05:00.766
I saw his head go plop. We
should celebrate with a drink.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.602
I mean, seriously, I'm worried,
Professor. You should exercise

05:03.604 --> 05:08.140
your facial muscles more.
- Mr. Fet, this is me happy,

05:08.142 --> 05:10.642
but we still have work to do.

05:10.644 --> 05:15.247
- That deceitful, half-human,
full-on thief decapitated

05:15.249 --> 05:17.182
the King Rat, right?

05:17.184 --> 05:20.352
Come on, come on. Drink.

05:23.022 --> 05:25.157
<i> Na Zdorov'ya!</i> Hey?

05:32.532 --> 05:36.101
Now the question is...
what's next?

05:36.103 --> 05:41.106
- Without the controlling
intelligence of the Master,

05:41.108 --> 05:43.675
the<i> strigoi</i> are on their own.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.977
Untethered. Feral.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.814
- Every muncher for himself.
- Precisely.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.782
- Well, then, you're right;

05:50.784 --> 05:54.386
our job isn't nearly done.
Lots of throats left to cut.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.388
But the tide has turned.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.824
And this is becoming
a proper extermination now.

05:58.826 --> 06:01.393
I should start
charging my hourly rate.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.335
Hey, Doc? Join us for a drink?

06:10.337 --> 06:12.804
(quietly): Stupid question.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.910
How's the patient?

06:18.912 --> 06:22.581
- He's gonna make it.
Not that he's happy about that.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.916
- (quietly): Well, neither am I.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.721
So how'd you end up on the pier?

06:29.723 --> 06:34.760
How did Quinlan
talk you into it?

06:39.899 --> 06:42.367
- Kelly offered me a deal.

06:42.369 --> 06:45.170
The<i> Lumen</i> for Zack.

06:45.172 --> 06:48.540
I helped Quinlan steal the book.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.610
The plan was to kill the Master
and get my son back.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.179
It half worked.

06:56.115 --> 07:00.519
- Wait a minute.
- You stole the book?

07:00.521 --> 07:03.789
- And teamed up with that
filthy half-muncher against us?

07:03.791 --> 07:06.258
- It wasn't about you.
- No?

07:06.260 --> 07:10.228
You came here and you told us
that Nora had died.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.731
Was that some kind of excuse
just so you could rip us off?

07:12.733 --> 07:14.933
Was that what it was? -Those
were two different things.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.902
- You had no right to do that.

07:16.904 --> 07:21.373
- No. I went out there
to try to save my son.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.942
I failed. You won.

07:29.215 --> 07:32.050
- There's your thank-you.
- You should have come to me.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.287
- They were keeping Zack alive
to trade him for the<i> Lumen.</i>

07:35.289 --> 07:38.990
Now there's no need for that.
- I'm sorry about your boy,

07:38.992 --> 07:43.228
Ephraim. Now, please leave.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.730
I don't want
to see you right now.

07:53.105 --> 07:56.141
(door opening)

07:56.143 --> 07:58.176
(door shutting)

07:58.178 --> 08:00.245
(distant yelling and sirens)

08:06.018 --> 08:09.588
(bird squawking)

08:12.625 --> 08:15.193
(heartbeat)

08:17.663 --> 08:19.931
(growling)

08:27.473 --> 08:30.108
(shrieking)

08:46.893 --> 08:49.394
(knocking)

08:51.397 --> 08:53.465
(louder knocking)

09:07.647 --> 09:10.815
(knocking)

09:19.158 --> 09:21.760
- May I use your bathroom?
- Where the hell have you been?

09:21.762 --> 09:24.296
- You don't wanna know.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.733
- Clearly you've been
sleeping in a Dumpster.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.769
- You're smelling pretty ripe
there yourself, Doc.

09:34.206 --> 09:36.841
- You-- Oh.
(Dutch peeing)

09:40.680 --> 09:44.015
- So... anyone else here?

09:46.218 --> 09:48.520
- No, Dutch.
(toilet flushing)

09:48.522 --> 09:51.890
- That's cool. I was just in
the neighbourhood and I thought,

09:51.892 --> 09:54.626
yeah, well, bloody hell,
why not, you know?

09:54.628 --> 09:56.695
So I'm here.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.232
- I see we're both
on the same liquid diet.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.436
- That obvious, huh?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.471
- I'm known for
my keen intuition.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.540
- Uh-huh.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.414
Oh, God, I'm not feeling great.

10:16.416 --> 10:19.250
I'm sick.

10:19.252 --> 10:22.554
Not<i> strigoi</i> sick.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.923
Booze sick.

10:24.925 --> 10:28.259
So don't cut my head off.
I'm gonna lie down.

10:28.261 --> 10:31.296
(bottles crashing)
- OK.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.132
Welcome home!

10:34.134 --> 10:38.003
(distant scraping)

10:51.917 --> 10:53.918
(growling)

10:53.920 --> 10:57.022
(rattling)

10:57.024 --> 11:01.259
- Mom? Mr. Eichorst?
(growling)

11:01.261 --> 11:03.628
(banging)

11:03.630 --> 11:05.530
Mom?!

11:05.532 --> 11:07.499
(growling)

11:07.501 --> 11:09.467
Mom!

11:09.469 --> 11:11.936
Help me! MOM!

11:11.938 --> 11:14.839
(growling)
No! Mom! No!

11:17.510 --> 11:19.511
MOM! No! Help me!

11:19.513 --> 11:22.380
MOM!
(squealing)

11:26.385 --> 11:30.689
- Zack. Are you OK?

11:34.860 --> 11:37.796
- What's happening?

11:37.798 --> 11:41.066
- Things have... changed.

11:41.068 --> 11:45.303
- How? That thing
was trying to sting me.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.073
- I'll protect you.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.575
I'm here now.

12:03.522 --> 12:05.757
- What is going on here?

12:07.693 --> 12:09.694
- He's fine.

12:09.696 --> 12:12.263
He's just scared.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.200
- And you?

12:15.202 --> 12:19.104
Are you fine as well?

12:19.106 --> 12:22.173
He was supposed to be safe.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.509
<i> Scheisse!</i>

12:24.511 --> 12:27.512
(speaking different language)
This cannot pass!

12:27.514 --> 12:30.215
There was a plan!
It cannot be abandoned!

12:30.217 --> 12:34.486
- What can we do?
- We must act.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.592
We will strike back.

12:55.407 --> 12:57.742
- Am I alive?

12:57.744 --> 13:00.912
Or are you in hell with me?

13:00.914 --> 13:03.515
- Purgatory at best.

13:08.921 --> 13:11.389
- My weapons?
- Over there.

13:15.261 --> 13:18.630
What happened?
- You saw it.

13:18.632 --> 13:22.333
I killed the Master.
- You chopped his head off.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.036
- That does not qualify?

13:31.410 --> 13:33.578
- Could you have been wrong?

13:33.580 --> 13:36.147
About dying after
the Master dies?

13:36.149 --> 13:39.984
- One only has one chance
to prove such a theory.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.454
Why? What is the state
of the city now?

13:43.456 --> 13:47.992
-<i> Strigoi</i> roaming the streets,
still feeding, but rudderless.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.296
No central intelligence.
- That's promising.

13:51.298 --> 13:54.699
- Yes.
- You seem not to be convinced.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.969
- As do you. - I didn't expect
to be pondering this issue.

13:57.971 --> 14:02.807
- Mr. Quinlan,
I want to know for sure.

14:02.809 --> 14:06.344
- You're right. We must know.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.747
And there's only one place
we can go for an answer.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.886
(alarm ringing)

14:14.888 --> 14:17.021
- Come on. Everybody up!
(whistle tweeting)

14:17.023 --> 14:19.791
Everybody get up!
- Morning!

14:19.793 --> 14:22.894
Wake up. Let's go,
guys. Come on!

14:22.896 --> 14:24.896
- Hey, get up.
- Come on!

14:24.898 --> 14:27.999
- Come on! Everybody up!
- Come on! Get up!

14:28.001 --> 14:31.169
- We've got heavy assignments
today. Come on, everybody up!

14:31.171 --> 14:35.039
Up! I don't want to be
here either, shithead.

14:35.041 --> 14:38.810
- (quietly): He's gonna
get what he deserves.

14:38.812 --> 14:41.412
- Oh, no, not now.
- I need five guys.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.382
One, two, three, four.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.552
- I'll be your fifth.
- All right.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.554
(whistle blowing)
Enough with the shuffling along.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.556
Pick up the pace.
- Just woke up.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.725
Damn, sister man.
- Move it!

14:53.727 --> 14:57.595
- Mad cracker.
- Whoa. Empty your pockets.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.664
- (distant man):
Let's go, guys. In the line.

15:02.334 --> 15:05.270
What the hell's this?
- The other officer told me

15:05.272 --> 15:08.373
I could keep them.
For my protection.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.542
- We gotta go! Let's move 'em
through the chow line.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.212
- 'K, you got 10 minutes to eat,
then we're loading the trucks.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.715
- Where we going?
- I'm only a cog in the wheel

15:17.717 --> 15:20.518
just like you. Come on.

15:20.520 --> 15:24.088
Move it. Move it.
(whistle blowing)

15:24.090 --> 15:26.958
- What're you guys in for?

15:26.960 --> 15:30.695
- My dumbass brother says, "Hey,
let's loot. Forget the curfew."

15:30.697 --> 15:33.231
Story of my life.
- We were starving out there.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.600
- You got us locked up.
- I was in my office building,

15:35.602 --> 15:38.102
just trying to get
some of my stuff out.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.071
I just wanted to
leave town. Apparently,

15:40.073 --> 15:42.774
I read the "cleared/not cleared"
signs incorrectly.

15:42.776 --> 15:46.210
- The past doesn't
mean shit now.

15:46.212 --> 15:49.213
(indistinct conversation)

15:49.215 --> 15:53.051
- Alright, get back to work.
- You got it, man.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.253
- Morning.
- Chain gangs?

15:55.255 --> 15:58.656
At best, I look
like an inept asshole.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.793
At worst, a lying sack of shit.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.329
That interview was
humiliating, Frank.

16:04.331 --> 16:07.432
Not to mention,
a 16-year-old boy?

16:07.434 --> 16:10.668
- We are doing what's necessary,
for this city and for you.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.571
- Ah, I love that. For me, yeah?

16:13.573 --> 16:15.940
That's rich.
- In case you haven't noticed,

16:15.942 --> 16:17.942
the prison system has collapsed.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.844
We're putting these
dirt bags to good use.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.746
- Since when do you make
these calls, Captain?

16:21.748 --> 16:26.484
You know what? I wanna see for
myself what this gigantic favor

16:26.486 --> 16:29.787
that you've done
for me looks like. Now.

16:29.789 --> 16:33.458
Get in.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.627
- Our job here today
is to clear all the tunnels

16:36.629 --> 16:39.330
between here and
One Police Plaza. Got it?

16:39.332 --> 16:41.466
- Where's our guns?

16:41.468 --> 16:43.801
- We don't give guns to inmates.
How stupid do you think we are?

16:43.803 --> 16:45.803
- Pretty stupid.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.106
(laughing)

16:48.108 --> 16:50.675
- You say something?

16:50.677 --> 16:53.311
- I said, what happens if
we refuse to go in there?

16:53.313 --> 16:57.181
- Then I have to use this.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.784
Do your job

16:59.786 --> 17:02.286
and I won't have to do mine.

17:04.323 --> 17:07.158
- Tough guy, right?
But you're not tough enough

17:07.160 --> 17:09.160
to go in there yourself.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.796
See, me, I don't got
a problem going in there.

17:11.798 --> 17:15.800
All I need is a pair of gloves.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.036
But the rest of these guys?

17:18.038 --> 17:20.104
They're not prepared for this.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.094
(groaning)

17:43.096 --> 17:46.264
- Smells worse than a bum's ass.
- Please, brother.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.033
You throw up, we all vomit.

17:49.035 --> 17:52.603
(chuckling)
- Hold on.

17:52.605 --> 17:57.075
I feel the breeze.
Let's go this way.

18:07.386 --> 18:09.454
(creepy music)

18:21.366 --> 18:23.701
(low growling)

18:26.972 --> 18:29.640
(growling)

18:29.642 --> 18:31.976
-<i> Ay dios mio.</i>

18:38.150 --> 18:41.285
(distant growling)

18:46.391 --> 18:49.660
(shrieking)
(grunting)

18:51.997 --> 18:54.532
(screeching)

18:56.602 --> 18:59.403
- My man! Angel De la Plata.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.305
- Thank you for coming,
senoritas.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.608
- Let's go back,
get the hell out.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.643
We're going to die here.
(screaming)

19:05.645 --> 19:08.479
Help me with this thing!
Get it away from me!

19:08.481 --> 19:11.182
- Kill it!
(grunting)

19:11.184 --> 19:13.684
Let's get out of here, man.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.120
(distant man yelling)

19:16.122 --> 19:18.956
(thump)

19:18.958 --> 19:20.958
(snarling)
Get out, get out!

19:20.960 --> 19:23.828
- Come on, come on, come on!

19:23.830 --> 19:26.430
(shaky breathing)

19:26.432 --> 19:29.200
(indistinct conversation)

19:36.308 --> 19:38.843
- You made it back.
I knew that you could.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.180
- There's... there's
something different

19:42.182 --> 19:44.882
about these creatures. OK?

19:44.884 --> 19:47.151
I mean, they're not
moving together anymore.

19:47.153 --> 19:50.521
Right? They're doing
their own thing now.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.590
- I'll make a note of it.

19:59.164 --> 20:02.233
Can I help you with something?
- Officer? Hi, yeah.

20:02.235 --> 20:05.469
I'm Justine Faraldo, Director
of Security for New York City.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.872
- Yes, ma'am.
We know who you are.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.874
- I'd like to talk
to one of the prisoners.

20:09.876 --> 20:14.111
- Anybody got something to say?

20:17.516 --> 20:19.584
(quietly): Watch yourself.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.654
- Hiya.

20:23.656 --> 20:27.491
Justine Faraldo.
- Augustine Elizalde.

20:27.493 --> 20:30.361
- Mr. Elizalde, is there
anything you want

20:30.363 --> 20:32.430
to tell me about how
things are being run here?

20:43.075 --> 20:45.142
- You can see for yourself.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.852
- Yes, I can.

20:59.891 --> 21:03.494
All right, then. Carry on.

21:07.299 --> 21:11.335
Jesus Christ. Is this
who we are now, Frank?

21:17.075 --> 21:19.410
- May I have your
attention, please?

21:19.412 --> 21:23.447
HEY! MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION!

21:23.449 --> 21:27.051
You have been selected

21:27.053 --> 21:29.620
to undertake a critical task --

21:29.622 --> 21:31.956
much too critical to be left

21:31.958 --> 21:34.725
to imbeciles like yourselves.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.762
These are trying times

21:37.764 --> 21:40.431
and we will persevere.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.601
Won't we?

21:43.603 --> 21:46.270
Ugh. You want to feed, yes?

21:46.272 --> 21:49.840
If you can follow
my simple instructions,

21:49.842 --> 21:52.943
I promise you a great feast.

21:52.945 --> 21:56.280
The virgin blood of 70 humans.

21:56.282 --> 21:58.749
But only once
the task is complete.

21:58.751 --> 22:02.320
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

22:02.322 --> 22:04.922
Nod if you understand.

22:08.126 --> 22:10.127
You are fine specimens.

22:10.129 --> 22:13.764
Justine Faraldo's own employees.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.867
Come with me.

22:20.038 --> 22:22.273
Stay here. You first.

22:22.275 --> 22:24.675
Hop up here.

22:26.712 --> 22:30.648
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends. Once more."

22:30.650 --> 22:32.717
Lie back.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.122
"In peace there's nothing
so becomes a man,

22:38.124 --> 22:41.492
"As modest stillness
and humility:

22:41.494 --> 22:44.829
"But when the blast
of war blows in our ears,

22:44.831 --> 22:49.100
Then imitate the
action of the tiger."

22:53.138 --> 22:55.439
Hold still now.

22:57.376 --> 23:01.379
"Disguise fair nature
with hard-favor'd rage;

23:01.381 --> 23:04.982
"Then lend the eye
a terrible aspect...

23:07.853 --> 23:10.588
"Let pry through
the portage of the head,

23:10.590 --> 23:14.024
"Like a brass cannon.

23:14.026 --> 23:17.428
Stiffen the sinews,
summon up the blood."

23:17.430 --> 23:20.231
This...

23:20.233 --> 23:23.601
is a great honor.

23:26.772 --> 23:29.840
"Be copy now to men
of grosser blood,

23:29.842 --> 23:32.276
And show them how to war."

23:39.551 --> 23:41.252
- I'm telling you, we took out
Bolivar, the King Rat.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.187
- "We," who?
- Myself and some associates.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.922
You know? That's why you're
seeing what you're seeing

23:44.924 --> 23:46.624
- out there.
- Come on.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.626
- We're getting the same
number of attacks as before.

23:48.628 --> 23:51.462
- Yeah, but random. One on one.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.464
We took out the<i> strigoi</i> WiFi.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.566
You know, these monsters
can't get a signal.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.701
You know, they're too dumb
to hide or coordinate.

23:57.703 --> 24:00.471
Like animals, you know?
They see food, they go after it.

24:00.473 --> 24:02.573
It makes them easy
to trap and kill.

24:02.575 --> 24:05.910
- Well, that's good, right?
- It's great. Yeah.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.879
Yeah, now's our chance,
all right? Now's our chance.

24:08.881 --> 24:11.549
We need a big push.
We need everybody that you got.

24:11.551 --> 24:15.152
Sweep this city clean of
munchers once and for all.

24:15.154 --> 24:18.622
- I can't sleep.

24:18.624 --> 24:21.325
Well, not without boozing
until I pass out.

24:23.261 --> 24:26.263
And then when I eventually do,

24:26.265 --> 24:29.400
I just end up dreaming

24:29.402 --> 24:33.904
about Eichorst's dungeon,

24:33.906 --> 24:36.307
that chain around my neck.

24:38.577 --> 24:42.112
I usually wake up
around 3:00, choking.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.748
And I can't get back
to sleep until the sun's up.

24:49.588 --> 24:51.989
- Have at it.
- What are these?

24:51.991 --> 24:54.792
- The green ones are for
when you wanna stay awake

24:54.794 --> 24:57.661
and the tan oval ones are for
when you want to go to sleep.

24:57.663 --> 25:02.466
- Do you still dream?
- Unfortunately.

25:02.468 --> 25:05.503
- One in here for heartache?
- I didn't want to ask you.

25:07.873 --> 25:10.107
- Good.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.543
God, I can't
believe Nora's gone.

25:12.545 --> 25:16.547
And the Master's dead.

25:16.549 --> 25:20.184
And Zack?

25:20.186 --> 25:22.319
- They're not going
to keep him alive.

25:22.321 --> 25:24.488
There's no reason to.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.790
- You don't know that.
- I'm not one

25:26.792 --> 25:28.993
for magical thinking.

25:28.995 --> 25:31.228
There's no way
they're keeping him alive.

25:33.632 --> 25:35.966
I've pissed off
Setrakian and Fet.

25:35.968 --> 25:39.169
- You did what you needed to do
to try and save your kid.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.139
- Thank you, but letting myself off
the hook is not exactly my style.

25:42.141 --> 25:45.309
- I believe that.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.519
Where in the hell
did you get a Taser?

25:55.521 --> 25:57.922
Woo!
- Guy I know.

25:57.924 --> 26:01.091
(stuttering)

26:01.093 --> 26:04.061
- Would it work on a<i> strigoi?</i>

26:04.063 --> 26:06.363
- Uh, contracts muscles.

26:06.365 --> 26:09.833
Should incapacitate them
for 10, 20 seconds?

26:09.835 --> 26:12.303
- All I'd need.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.942
What are you gonna do now, Doc?

26:17.944 --> 26:20.611
- You're looking at
a man without a plan.

26:20.613 --> 26:24.214
So I guess I'll just
have another drink

26:24.216 --> 26:26.817
and think about it.

26:29.020 --> 26:31.021
- I'm sorry for everything
you've been through.

26:31.023 --> 26:33.357
I wish I'd been here to help.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.826
- Well, you're here now.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.598
<i> - The Master is slain.</i>

26:40.600 --> 26:43.734
I've cut off his head.

26:43.736 --> 26:47.237
After centuries
of pursuit, he is fallen.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.406
- We felt it.

26:49.408 --> 26:52.943
He was weakened.
His guard was down. Briefly.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.779
- Briefly? What do you mean?

26:55.781 --> 26:58.315
- He is formless.
That much we understand.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.284
- What does that mean?

27:00.286 --> 27:02.820
- He has not yet
taken another body.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.255
- But he will?

27:05.257 --> 27:08.058
(growling)
Is that what's happening?

27:08.060 --> 27:10.661
- With you,
we will share nothing!

27:10.663 --> 27:12.796
We want our book.

27:12.798 --> 27:16.734
- Yes. Lots of stealing
books going around.

27:19.437 --> 27:21.438
I saw something.

27:21.440 --> 27:24.908
A red worm -- crimson.

27:24.910 --> 27:28.445
Not like the others.
(growling)

27:28.447 --> 27:31.482
- If you did not kill
the crimson worm,

27:31.484 --> 27:33.450
you did not slay the Master.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.986
- What worm is this?

27:35.988 --> 27:37.988
- The essence of his being.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.958
He has not yet taken another
host, but when he does,

27:40.960 --> 27:45.529
he will be just
as powerful as before.

27:45.531 --> 27:48.866
- A crimson worm.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.606
You might have told me.

27:55.608 --> 27:59.309
You might have... You might
have tried to help me.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.545
How about I cut off
your useless heads

28:01.547 --> 28:03.814
and expose the essence
of your being?

28:03.816 --> 28:05.749
(growling)

28:20.165 --> 28:22.900
I risk everything

28:22.902 --> 28:26.537
and you three husks

28:26.539 --> 28:28.672
just sit here,

28:28.674 --> 28:31.608
awaiting the end of your days.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.916
Take a good, long look at me.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.952
You will never see me again.

28:45.156 --> 28:48.425
(growling)

28:57.335 --> 28:59.670
(radio chatter)

29:05.877 --> 29:08.579
(indistinct voices)

29:19.224 --> 29:21.291
(chatter)

29:35.440 --> 29:38.942
(intense music)

29:38.944 --> 29:41.779
- Look, I'm not saying it's
gonna be easy-peasy or anything.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.214
These things are fast and feral.
- Excuse me.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.787
(beeping)

29:49.789 --> 29:51.989
- Now that we're
holding Staten Island...

29:51.991 --> 29:55.993
(escalating music)

29:58.763 --> 30:01.231
(screaming)
- Get down!

30:01.233 --> 30:04.234
(alarm blaring)

30:04.236 --> 30:07.805
(yelling)

30:07.807 --> 30:10.340
- Get it off! Get it off!

30:10.342 --> 30:12.309
- They're all over me!
- Get it off!

30:12.311 --> 30:15.746
Get it off!
(screaming)

30:15.748 --> 30:18.115
They're all over me!

30:18.117 --> 30:20.184
- Christ almighty. Jesus.

30:20.186 --> 30:23.453
- Goddammit!
- Shit!

30:23.455 --> 30:26.023
- Take it off, off, off!
- Get it off me. Get it off me!

30:26.025 --> 30:28.959
What is that? What is that?
- Hold still.

30:28.961 --> 30:31.795
Hold still.
- What is that?

30:31.797 --> 30:34.464
- (man): Don't touch
anything! Nobody move!

30:34.466 --> 30:37.868
- Ah! Ah!

30:37.870 --> 30:40.771
(grunting)

30:46.544 --> 30:48.545
Did you get it?

30:48.547 --> 30:51.615
- I think so.

30:51.617 --> 30:54.351
- Are you hit?
- Yeah.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.620
- Get a doctor here! Get
Goodweather here, right now!

31:12.804 --> 31:15.806
Goodweather,
she's over here. Come on.

31:31.089 --> 31:33.724
- Hi.

31:33.726 --> 31:36.226
- A pretty terrible thing, huh?

31:36.228 --> 31:39.029
- Sickening, yeah.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.198
- Is that my shirt?

31:41.200 --> 31:44.701
- Oh, shit.

31:44.703 --> 31:48.505
Yeah, Eph let me stay at
your place last night. Sorry.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.041
- He's quite a guy, huh?

31:51.043 --> 31:53.377
Takes over my place,
gives away my clothes,

31:53.379 --> 31:55.712
amongst other things.

31:55.714 --> 31:59.549
- Yeah, I heard.
- Since when have you two

31:59.551 --> 32:01.351
been best buddies?

32:01.353 --> 32:04.855
- Since I lost all my friends.

32:06.791 --> 32:10.427
- Where's Nikki?
- She left town with her mother.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.429
- You didn't go with her?

32:12.431 --> 32:15.065
- Wasn't invited.

32:15.067 --> 32:18.602
- Sorry.
- Yeah. Me, too.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.604
Eph said you don't
come home anymore.

32:20.606 --> 32:23.240
- I've been staying
at the Mayfield.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.642
You know, closer to the action.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.245
Easier that way,
cleaner. You know,

32:28.247 --> 32:30.247
fewer attachments,
fewer opportunities

32:30.249 --> 32:32.449
for disappointment.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.719
- Right.

32:41.159 --> 32:43.160
Do you mind if I stay at
your place a couple of days

32:43.162 --> 32:45.562
just until I get myself sorted?

32:45.564 --> 32:48.098
- Be my guest.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.568
It doesn't really feel like
mine anymore, anyway. You know?

32:53.471 --> 32:55.339
- Yeah.
- I gotta go help here.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.240
So, you know.
- Yeah, yeah.

32:57.242 --> 33:00.444
You take care of yourself.
- Yeah.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.846
- Yeah.
- You too!

33:07.819 --> 33:10.620
- Well, there's
no sign of worms.

33:10.622 --> 33:14.124
For now.
- All right.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.827
- We'll know for
certain in two hours.

33:16.829 --> 33:19.463
- Two hours, huh?

33:19.465 --> 33:22.366
Not even enough time to
put my affairs in order.

33:22.368 --> 33:25.135
- Well, it looks
like Fet got it.

33:25.137 --> 33:28.105
Time will tell.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.607
- Straight talk, Doc.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.976
How many others
that have had worms

33:32.978 --> 33:35.078
get to their eyes have survived?

33:37.615 --> 33:40.617
- Zero.

33:43.321 --> 33:46.189
- I need some
time alone, please.

33:54.298 --> 33:56.867
(door shutting)

33:56.869 --> 34:00.404
- You think you got it?

34:03.808 --> 34:06.843
- I don't know.
It happened too fast.

34:06.845 --> 34:09.880
- Well, it's a good
thing you were there.

34:09.882 --> 34:12.582
- We weren't the only ones hit.

34:12.584 --> 34:15.685
Staten Island,
two other checkpoints.

34:15.687 --> 34:20.090
Death toll's 60 and rising.
So much for your theory.

34:24.195 --> 34:27.998
- The exploding<i> strigoi</i> here
targeted this place and Justine.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.934
Feels like a coordinated
attack to me, Doc.

34:32.870 --> 34:35.705
I gotta say, yours
and Quinlan's great adventure

34:35.707 --> 34:39.276
didn't seem to work out so well.

34:45.183 --> 34:47.551
(distant siren)

34:47.553 --> 34:49.553
(men yelling)

34:49.555 --> 34:51.788
(distant siren)

34:55.226 --> 34:57.761
(knocking)

35:00.131 --> 35:02.466
- You ready?

35:21.285 --> 35:24.588
- You know when my husband
Tommy went down in the towers?

35:24.590 --> 35:29.426
There were a few hours
where we just didn't know.

35:29.428 --> 35:32.596
Would they find
anyone alive in there?

35:32.598 --> 35:37.000
How many survivors
would there be? 1,000? 50?

35:39.070 --> 35:41.671
All those people lined up
outside St. Vincent's

35:41.673 --> 35:45.842
to donate blood.
Ambulances waiting,

35:45.844 --> 35:51.081
beds in hospitals being prepped
for bodies that never came.

35:51.083 --> 35:53.717
We just... waited.

35:56.687 --> 35:59.923
But then we knew for sure that

35:59.925 --> 36:03.026
no one was coming back.

36:05.363 --> 36:08.165
A different kind of hell.

36:11.636 --> 36:13.703
I'm ready.

36:22.713 --> 36:25.882
(high-pitched ringing)

36:25.884 --> 36:28.785
My first thought was
go someplace in the city.

36:30.988 --> 36:33.190
My favorite spot.

36:33.192 --> 36:35.525
But...

36:35.527 --> 36:38.328
Make a big public thing of it?

36:38.330 --> 36:40.997
Or my car, even,

36:40.999 --> 36:43.700
but I like my car.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.703
Like my house.

36:46.705 --> 36:50.040
Don't want to leave
that mess for someone else.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.212
Which is what it comes down to.

36:58.182 --> 37:00.517
So, my garden.

37:00.519 --> 37:03.353
Still winter but, you know.

37:03.355 --> 37:06.022
My own backyard.

37:06.024 --> 37:09.092
Looking up at the stars.

37:09.094 --> 37:11.661
- You're clean.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.666
- You're shitting me.

37:16.668 --> 37:20.370
Absolutely certain?

37:20.372 --> 37:22.572
100% positive?

37:22.574 --> 37:24.641
No questions?
- Clean.

37:28.512 --> 37:30.513
- Thank you!
- Don't thank me.

37:30.515 --> 37:33.016
Thank Fet.

37:41.125 --> 37:44.361
- I'm having a moment
of extreme clarity here.

37:47.565 --> 37:50.133
- Good.

37:57.942 --> 38:01.077
- I can't believe it.
I'm so relieved! Justine--

38:01.079 --> 38:03.246
- Frank, have the guys
bring the car around.

38:03.248 --> 38:06.116
I need to pay someone a visit.

38:07.918 --> 38:09.986
- Yeah, of course.

38:23.768 --> 38:26.503
- Incredible, Faraldo
walked away from that.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.773
God, I love second chances.
- I'll drink to that.

38:29.775 --> 38:33.643
- Do you think
New York will get one?

38:33.645 --> 38:36.680
- I'm trying
to remain optimistic.

38:36.682 --> 38:39.482
- I'm hungry.

38:39.484 --> 38:42.252
- I'm out of booze.
- What do you say

38:42.254 --> 38:44.187
we go out tonight?

38:44.189 --> 38:46.856
Drinks and dinner?
- No dancing?

38:46.858 --> 38:48.958
- I think the burglary tools
might weigh us down too much.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.927
I know some places
that haven't been looted.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.029
- You had me at "drinks."

38:58.669 --> 39:01.037
- Hang on a sec.

39:03.107 --> 39:05.675
- Hi, I'm looking for--
- Whoa, what are you doing?

39:05.677 --> 39:08.244
- Ah. There you are. Hi, Bella.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.282
Excuse us, please.
- No, we don't need privacy.

39:12.284 --> 39:14.451
- Get out.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.319
- Stay right outside
that door, OK?

39:16.321 --> 39:19.055
- You got it.
- Come on, let's go.

39:19.057 --> 39:22.959
- You heard about all the shit
that went down today?

39:22.961 --> 39:27.630
And still, this is
what you're working on?

39:27.632 --> 39:29.699
- I'm sorry, how is this
any of your business?

39:29.701 --> 39:31.701
- Shut up.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.304
Faith in the war effort
is paramount. And what

39:34.306 --> 39:36.906
you're doing here
undercuts all of that.

39:36.908 --> 39:40.009
Your work does nothing
but serve your ego

39:40.011 --> 39:43.213
and cause me and
my people more harm.

39:43.215 --> 39:46.383
And too many brave souls
have given their lives

39:46.385 --> 39:49.085
for me to put up with your shit.

39:49.087 --> 39:52.455
- You really don't have a choice
about what I do or don't do.

40:02.433 --> 40:04.434
- Clean it out.
- What do you mean clean it out?

40:04.436 --> 40:07.704
- Everything.
- You can't hold me back.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.706
This is my equipment!

40:09.708 --> 40:12.609
- What are you doing?
No, no, no, no. Stop it!

40:12.611 --> 40:15.378
Stop it! You can't
do this! No! Get out!

40:15.380 --> 40:18.515
Stop it! Look! This is illegal!

40:18.517 --> 40:21.184
(grunting)
- Arrest her.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.286
- You piece of shit!

40:23.288 --> 40:25.355
What is this?
- Come on.

40:25.357 --> 40:27.757
- This is your due process.

40:32.763 --> 40:35.732
(distant gunshots)

40:35.734 --> 40:37.767
(dog barking)

40:37.769 --> 40:40.336
(distant woman yelling)

40:48.412 --> 40:51.648
- You OK?
- Yeah, fine.

40:51.650 --> 40:54.284
It's just a little darker
out here than I thought.

40:54.286 --> 40:57.253
- Yeah, it's night time.
- You really missed

40:57.255 --> 40:59.322
your calling.
You of the witty retorts.

41:01.926 --> 41:04.260
(beep)
What? You're charging me?

41:04.262 --> 41:06.496
- People keep flagging me down.
It's like nothing

41:06.498 --> 41:08.765
in New York has changed.
- Holy shit!

41:08.767 --> 41:10.633
- It must have been
nesting back there.

41:10.635 --> 41:13.436
I've gotta start locking this
cab. Do you know how hard it was

41:13.438 --> 41:16.406
to find a car with gas and keys?

41:16.408 --> 41:19.509
(roaring)
(buzzing)

41:22.079 --> 41:24.848
What do you know? It works.
- Hell, yeah.

41:27.952 --> 41:30.820
- (deep voice): Goodweather.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.590
You failed.

41:33.592 --> 41:36.359
You want to ask me about
your son, Goodweather,

41:36.361 --> 41:38.661
but you're afraid of the answer.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.531
- Where is he?
- He is with me.

41:41.533 --> 41:43.466
Always with me.

41:43.468 --> 41:46.035
- Is he turned?

41:46.037 --> 41:49.506
Answer me!

41:49.508 --> 41:51.941
ANSWER ME!
(screeching)

41:51.943 --> 41:55.778
(sizzling)
(dog barking)
