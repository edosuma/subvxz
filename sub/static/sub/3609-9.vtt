[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.629 --> 00:05.665
You want me to save your life?

00:05.756 --> 00:07.838
I want you to want to save my life.

00:07.925 --> 00:10.302
I made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sack.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.674
Now, if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour, he's dead.

00:13.764 --> 00:17.632
I'd like for you to go back in there,
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

00:17.727 --> 00:20.935
- Why would I do that?
- I'm going to help your friends escape.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.520
[cocks gun]

00:24.275 --> 00:25.560
- No!
- Danny!

00:34.327 --> 00:37.865
[Sawyer] J‘ Show me the way to go home

00:39.624 --> 00:42.741
J‘ I’m tired and / want to go bed

00:44.295 --> 00:48.379
J‘ Had a little drink about an hour ago

00:48.466 --> 00:50.673
J‘ And it went straight to my head

00:50.760 --> 00:53.001
- Stop.
- What, you want a turn steering?

00:54.055 --> 00:56.842
- We have to go back.
- What are you talking about?

00:56.933 --> 00:58.218
Turn the boat around.

00:58.309 --> 01:01.221
- Have you lost your mind? We got away!
- Just do it.

01:01.312 --> 01:05.305
- Give me one reason to turn around!
- Because we can't leave Jack behind.

01:10.655 --> 01:14.773
Yes, we can, Freckles...
because that's what he asked us to do.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.616
You think about it.
We go back there,

01:17.703 --> 01:21.161
what do you think Captain Bunnykiller
is gonna do if he catches us?

01:21.249 --> 01:23.365
Kill you.

01:25.670 --> 01:27.877
God loves you as he loved Jacob.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.542
OK. Thanks for the input.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.504
Sorry, kiddo.

01:40.518 --> 01:41.598
Jack's on his own.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.933
[Friendly] Time to get up.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.807
We're moving you.

01:52.071 --> 01:54.687
- Moving me where?
- Someplace else, Jack.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.276
VVhy?

01:59.203 --> 02:00.864
[chuckles]

02:03.124 --> 02:05.490
- So this is it, huh?
- It?

02:06.127 --> 02:09.460
You just helped me save his life.
If you're gonna kill me, please,

02:09.547 --> 02:12.914
at least show me the respect
of not calling it "moving."

02:13.426 --> 02:15.291
Now why would we kill you?

02:16.554 --> 02:17.964
Because you're done with me.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.046
What kind of people
do you think we are?

02:20.141 --> 02:21.597
Oh, I don't know, Tom...

02:22.685 --> 02:25.643
...the kind of people
that would take a pregnant woman,

02:25.730 --> 02:27.937
would hang Charlie from a tree,

02:28.399 --> 02:30.435
would drag our people
out of the jungle,

02:30.526 --> 02:32.608
would kidnap children.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.153
That's the kind of people
I think you are.

02:47.293 --> 02:50.410
You see this glass house
you're living in, Jack?

02:51.797 --> 02:54.174
How about | get you some stones?

02:55.176 --> 02:57.041
[door opens]

03:00.389 --> 03:02.550
Let's do this the easy way.
What do you say?

03:25.831 --> 03:27.367
Hey.

04:03.160 --> 04:07.529
[seagulls calling]

04:19.009 --> 04:21.386
Dr. Jack! Hey, Dr. Jack!

04:22.179 --> 04:25.012
Dr. Jack want soda, Dr. Jack?

04:30.521 --> 04:33.763
[speaks Thai]

04:35.151 --> 04:37.984
[continues in Thai]

04:39.738 --> 04:42.275
You know I can't understand
a word you're saying?

04:42.575 --> 04:43.735
Dr. Jack.

04:45.411 --> 04:46.742
[bottle cap clinking]

04:46.829 --> 04:47.864
You're welcome.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.927
[woman laughs]

05:59.818 --> 06:02.230
Thank you. Thank you very much.

06:02.655 --> 06:04.737
You're not from around here, are you?

06:07.910 --> 06:11.448
No. No, I'm not. I'm Jack.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.163
Hi, Jack. l'm Achara.

06:15.751 --> 06:18.117
Achara? Achara.

06:39.275 --> 06:41.436
Juliet grilled these for me.

06:43.696 --> 06:45.687
Who was that woman?

06:46.031 --> 06:47.817
That'd be the sheriff.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.732
- You have a sheriff?
- Not literally.

06:50.828 --> 06:55.663
- Why're you moving Juliet into my room?
- Because she's in trouble, Jack.

07:00.546 --> 07:03.913
Now don't try anything stupid.
You stay put in this cage, OK?

07:04.008 --> 07:07.671
You say that like you're not watching me
from that camera right there.

07:08.012 --> 07:12.176
Oh, right. Ben told me
you got into the... surveillance room.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.650
Let me ask you something.

07:26.822 --> 07:31.191
You risk your neck to cut them loose,
and they run away and don't look back...

07:31.285 --> 07:32.900
Thanks for the sandwich.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.371
[Sawyer] Never thought I'd be glad
to get back to this rock.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.380
What are you doing?

07:47.509 --> 07:49.090
I'm heading in to shore.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.635
Why? If we just keep going,
we can circle around.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.634
We'll get to camp,
tell Locke and Sayid what happened...

07:54.725 --> 07:58.058
Oh, we will? You got a map
you ain't showing me, Magella?

07:59.730 --> 08:02.813
We got no food, no water,
and I can't steer in the dark.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.436
Then I'll steer.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.141
No.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.978
You'll come ashore
and we'll make camp.

08:11.033 --> 08:14.696
You wanna contribute? You can build
a camp fire while I carry the kid.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.911
Glad we agree.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.209
You sure you ain't hungry?

08:32.596 --> 08:34.382
No, James. I ain't hungry.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.094
You shouldn't fight.

08:39.103 --> 08:41.139
When the hell did you wake up?

08:41.605 --> 08:44.517
You shouldn't fight,
because you're lucky to be alive.

08:44.608 --> 08:48.442
[chuckling]
Golly! I think he's got a point.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.315
That island we were on,
is that where your people live?

08:54.410 --> 08:56.492
Just where we work.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.831
- [Kate] Work on what?
- Projects.

08:59.915 --> 09:03.658
Oh, sure. Like the
Steal the Kid Off the Raft Project?

09:03.752 --> 09:07.415
- That was a humdinger.
- So you don't live on that island?

09:07.506 --> 09:10.339
- Nope.
- So you live here?

09:10.426 --> 09:13.589
- On this island?
- Yes, ma'am.

09:17.641 --> 09:21.884
And what did you do with the people
that you took... the kids?

09:21.979 --> 09:24.345
- Give them a better life.
- Better than what?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.315
Better than yours.

09:35.409 --> 09:39.493
There's not gonna be
any moon tonight. It'll be dark.

09:40.122 --> 09:42.704
Me and Alex used to lie
in my back yard at night

09:42.791 --> 09:45.077
and make up names
for the constellations.

09:45.169 --> 09:49.913
You can't see it yet, but right there
will be Ursa Theodorus.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.214
The teddy bear.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.918
- You have back yards?
- Yeah.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.139
Well, ain't that quaint.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.856
- [electronic voice] Warning.
- [buzzer hums]

10:12.404 --> 10:15.612
- Warning.
- [buzzer hums]

10:20.454 --> 10:23.446
[animal hoots in the distance]

10:32.216 --> 10:36.084
- I thought you were locked up.
- They let me out to examine Ben.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.385
His vitals are low,
and he has a fever.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.805
I took this about ten minutes ago.
It's of his stitches.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.019
They're infected, aren't they?

10:47.856 --> 10:49.892
- Yes.
- Will you come look at him?

10:51.235 --> 10:52.315
- No.
- Jack...

10:52.402 --> 10:55.860
- No.
- I'm not asking you for them or him.

10:55.948 --> 10:59.190
I'm asking you as
a personal favor to me.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.828
You want me to help him again?

11:05.207 --> 11:08.665
- Yes.
- Are you sure about that, Juliet?

11:08.752 --> 11:11.664
Yes. I'm sure.

11:11.755 --> 11:15.293
And this is because he said
that he would let you go home?

11:15.384 --> 11:16.920
No.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.885
No.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.390
It's because I'm in trouble.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.680
- Trouble for...
- I killed someone.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.353
It's why they put me in your room.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.268
Who?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.189
lt's complicated.

11:38.657 --> 11:41.649
Well, then let me simplify it for you.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.280
I'm not gonna help him.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.321
And I'm not gonna help you.

12:10.105 --> 12:13.268
OK! Special Thai dish for you. You try.

12:23.619 --> 12:24.699
[man] Hmm?

12:24.786 --> 12:26.651
Hmm?

12:26.747 --> 12:29.238
Very brave, very brave.

12:32.669 --> 12:36.412
- My brother likes you.
- Well, I'm a very likable guy.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.719
So, Jack...

12:42.679 --> 12:44.419
...tell me something.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.421
Shoot.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.508
Why is it you don't know
how to fly a kite?

12:51.146 --> 12:54.604
- Just never learned, I guess.
- That's very sad.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.556
Well, my dad worked a lot,

12:57.778 --> 13:00.611
and he wasn't exactly
the kite-flying type, anyway.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.779
- I mean, we never really...
- Jack?

13:02.866 --> 13:06.950
- Yeah?
- l have no interest in your father.

13:07.037 --> 13:10.621
Well, that's a relief because
I'm pretty tired of talking about him.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.698
Some things are personal.

13:19.925 --> 13:23.634
So you're in Phuket to find yourself?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.967
- Why would you say that?
- You're an American.

13:30.727 --> 13:34.515
[speaking Thai]

13:49.079 --> 13:51.070
l have a gift.

13:52.207 --> 13:55.040
Must be one hell of a gift.

14:15.230 --> 14:18.893
[speaks Chinese]

14:22.279 --> 14:25.191
Oh, I was just reading your tattoos.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.614
The five and the stars are very cute.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.738
But the Chinese, | find a...

14:33.040 --> 14:34.871
...bit ironic.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.661
- You find what ironic?
- What it says.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.704
You do know what it says?

14:44.301 --> 14:48.385
- Yeah. I know what it says.
- Are you sure?

14:49.139 --> 14:51.721
Chinese is a very
complicated language.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.891
It's fairly common for things
to get lost in translation.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.843
I know what it says.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.605
All right, then.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.442
Jack?

15:06.406 --> 15:07.987
My name is Isabel.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.405
If you'll come with me,

15:12.496 --> 15:15.283
I'd like to talk to you
and ask you a few questions.

15:28.678 --> 15:32.466
Why don't you check on your father,
sweetheart? I know he'd appreciate it.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.653
Please have a seat, Jack.

15:48.740 --> 15:52.403
As you may have gathered,
we don't live on this little island.

15:52.494 --> 15:55.702
In fact, most of us don't really
even like coming here.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.575
There's been an incident
l'm investigating

15:58.667 --> 16:00.578
and I need to ask you some questions.

16:00.669 --> 16:05.129
So I was hoping you may help me
clear up a few of the...

16:05.882 --> 16:08.168
...inconsistencies.

16:08.552 --> 16:10.634
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, Tom,

16:10.720 --> 16:13.632
but you said in the midst
of a surgical procedure,

16:13.723 --> 16:19.138
Jack made several comments indicating
that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben.

16:21.356 --> 16:25.770
- Yeah. That's right.
- Is that true, Jack?

16:25.861 --> 16:28.227
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

16:31.032 --> 16:32.568
The question's simple.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.571
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

16:42.419 --> 16:48.255
No. No, lwas lying. lwould've done
anything to get my friends out.

16:48.341 --> 16:52.755
Turning you people against each other
was my best chance of creating chaos.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.392
Why are you lying for her, Jack?

17:20.457 --> 17:22.539
I'd like to go back to my cage now.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.298
Who's there?

17:37.057 --> 17:39.139
Mmm. Who do you think?

17:39.226 --> 17:40.762
[smooch]

17:50.320 --> 17:52.436
What time is it?

17:53.490 --> 17:54.821
lt's late.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.744
- Salty.
- I went for a swim in the ocean.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.667
Washing the day off of you, huh?

18:10.298 --> 18:13.005
Is there something
you'd like to ask me, Jack?

18:13.093 --> 18:14.924
No, not at all.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.469
I mean, it might be nice,

18:19.182 --> 18:22.174
after a month of you coming in
whenever you want,

18:22.727 --> 18:24.843
to find out something about you.

18:30.527 --> 18:34.111
There are things that happen here
that you could never understand.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.079
Like your gift?

18:46.334 --> 18:49.747
Yes... like my gift.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.878
[moaning]

19:03.727 --> 19:05.763
[laughing]

19:13.111 --> 19:14.817
Are you having fun with me, Jack?

19:17.741 --> 19:19.572
Oh, yeah.

19:20.702 --> 19:23.990
Then stop asking questions.
Let's have fun.

19:29.085 --> 19:33.419
[people chattering]

19:45.477 --> 19:47.092
What?!

19:51.441 --> 19:53.477
Hey, Jack.

19:57.364 --> 20:00.697
Do I... do I know you?

20:04.287 --> 20:05.823
Eight-fifteen. You...

20:08.458 --> 20:10.494
- You were the stewardess.
- Cindy.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.243
How...?

20:14.798 --> 20:18.165
What are you doing here with them?
I thought you were taken.

20:18.259 --> 20:21.296
- You were... you were captured.
- They're not...

20:22.639 --> 20:24.800
It's not that simple.

20:26.101 --> 20:29.764
What are they doing here, right now?
What are you doing here?!

20:31.064 --> 20:33.601
We're here to watch, Jack.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.564
Watch what?

20:39.030 --> 20:40.816
What is it, sweetheart?

20:44.828 --> 20:47.911
She wants to know
how Ana Lucia is doing.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.919
- Are you serious?
- What?

20:57.006 --> 20:59.918
If you've got something to watch, Cindy,
go watch it!

21:01.678 --> 21:03.009
Go!

21:32.333 --> 21:33.618
- Sawyer.
- What?

21:33.710 --> 21:36.622
- Sawyer, wake up.
- [moans]

21:38.214 --> 21:41.001
He's gone! Karl's gone!

21:41.301 --> 21:43.007
Where?

21:48.808 --> 21:51.470
- [Karl sobbing]
- Wait, hold up.

21:56.441 --> 21:57.897
I got it.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.067
- No, let me talk to him.
- No, I got it.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.644
Boys only.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.775
[Karl continues sobbing]

22:12.916 --> 22:14.998
Ow!

22:15.084 --> 22:17.951
- What the hell was that for?
- So you'd cowboy up.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.213
Crying in the jungle!

22:22.300 --> 22:25.667
I thought you people
were supposed to be tough.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.753
I am tough.

22:29.224 --> 22:31.215
Sure, you are, Bobby.

22:32.769 --> 22:35.385
Bobby? The Brady Bunch?

22:36.022 --> 22:38.604
What the hell is The Brady Bunch?

22:39.526 --> 22:41.437
OK.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.735
Anyway, look, Karl...

22:47.659 --> 22:49.365
I been with a lot of girls.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.446
Some of them worth the trouble...

22:56.000 --> 22:57.501
...and some not.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.873
But every now and again,

23:01.381 --> 23:02.871
there's one...

23:08.805 --> 23:11.763
One you name dumb stars with.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.390
So this girl,

23:18.481 --> 23:21.097
- Sally Slingshot...
- Alex.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.399
Yeah. You love her?

23:25.822 --> 23:27.312
More than anything.

23:29.951 --> 23:32.158
Then go back
to wherever the hell your...

23:33.162 --> 23:35.653
...yards are and get her back.

23:37.500 --> 23:41.584
If I get caught...
they'll kill me this time.

23:46.801 --> 23:50.134
Well, at least it'll be worth it.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.516
[smash]

24:10.033 --> 24:11.773
I want to ask you something.

24:12.869 --> 24:16.202
They're not watching anymore,
so you can tell me the truth.

24:18.374 --> 24:19.875
OK.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.699
Ben.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.250
Why'd you save his life?

24:24.881 --> 24:28.874
All this time, after all he did to you
and your people, you should hate him!

24:30.595 --> 24:32.881
But you still fixed him up.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.759
Even after your friends got away. Why?

24:36.392 --> 24:38.223
You're his daughter.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.813
- Answer the question.
- I'll answer, if you answer mine.

24:46.402 --> 24:49.565
- Where is Juliet?
- She's with the rest of them.

24:49.656 --> 24:52.944
- They're gonna read her verdict.
- Her verdict?

24:53.034 --> 24:55.070
And we all know what it's gonna be.

24:55.995 --> 24:59.237
We're pretty strict about
killing one of our own.

25:01.668 --> 25:04.660
- Eye for an eye.
- Who? Who did she kill?

25:04.754 --> 25:07.746
The man who was gonna
murder your friends.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.212
No wonder you're worried about her.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.432
If it wasn't for you,
she never would've done it.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.268
That was three questions.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.184
Your turn, Jack.

25:27.610 --> 25:30.397
I saved your father
because I said I would.

25:37.787 --> 25:40.324
Hey. Hey.

25:41.124 --> 25:42.614
Is he still in charge?

25:43.626 --> 25:45.162
- What?
- Ben, your father.

25:45.253 --> 25:48.086
Is he still in charge?
Will Isabel do what he says?

25:48.965 --> 25:51.422
- Yeah.
- Get me out of this cage.

25:56.597 --> 25:58.098
I wouldn't do that.

26:03.396 --> 26:06.354
The cavalry has arrived at last.

26:17.660 --> 26:21.403
I'd be much more impressed with you
people if you had a good surgeon.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.579
We had an excellent surgeon, Jack.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.333
His name was Ethan.

26:33.176 --> 26:35.087
You have a serious infection, Ben.

26:35.845 --> 26:39.212
That infected tissue needs to be
re-incised and débrided.

26:39.307 --> 26:42.515
And you need to be very closely
monitored from here on out.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.971
There might be nerve damage or
any number of other complications.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.561
You might not walk again.

26:52.987 --> 26:56.354
Your bedside manner
leaves something to be desired, Jack.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.945
Well, then it's too bad
you're stuck with me.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.821
- Am I?
- You need a doctor, Ben.

27:04.916 --> 27:07.498
Someone to stay with you.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.746
Bring you back to good health.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.665
And here we go again.

27:17.595 --> 27:20.507
I've already given you
a ticket off this island, Jack.

27:20.598 --> 27:22.964
What's it gonna cost me this time?

27:23.059 --> 27:25.801
Right now,
your people are in a room

27:25.895 --> 27:30.389
deciding whether or not
to execute Juliet.

27:33.903 --> 27:36.110
You're gonna stop it.

27:36.697 --> 27:39.439
Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.450
It doesn't matter what she's done.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.279
No matter what you think...

27:48.584 --> 27:51.075
...she is one of us.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.213
Do we have a deal or not?

28:03.641 --> 28:05.677
Does Isabel have a walkie?

28:07.311 --> 28:09.427
They're already in the meeting.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.603
Then get me something to write on.

28:21.242 --> 28:24.109
- [music playing]
- [indistinct chattering]

29:33.856 --> 29:35.847
[Achara] You followed me.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.691
What is all this?

29:45.368 --> 29:47.108
This is where | work.

29:47.203 --> 29:48.613
And you shouldn't be here.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.532
This is a...

29:55.544 --> 29:57.876
A tattoo parlor.
That was your big secret?

29:59.632 --> 30:02.294
The envelopes? Your gift?

30:02.385 --> 30:04.717
I am not a tattoo artist.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.851
I am able to see who people are.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.980
My work is not decoration.

30:18.359 --> 30:20.145
It is definition.

30:22.530 --> 30:23.861
And this...

30:24.532 --> 30:26.147
This is my gift.

30:27.243 --> 30:29.484
So...

30:29.578 --> 30:33.287
- ...you see who people are.
- Yes.

30:33.374 --> 30:35.581
And | mark them.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.332
So tell me who lam.

30:42.258 --> 30:43.873
No.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.342
- Why not?
- You are an outsider.

30:52.727 --> 30:57.266
- Do you see who I am, Achara?
- [whispering] Yes.

30:59.442 --> 31:02.855
- [whispering] Who am |?
- You are a leader.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.648
A great man.

31:06.449 --> 31:08.235
But this...

31:10.619 --> 31:12.325
This makes you lonely.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.279
And frightened.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.825
And angry.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.251
Good.

31:30.431 --> 31:31.921
Now put it on me.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.015
Put it on me.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.510
No, this...

31:38.564 --> 31:40.976
This is against my people.

31:51.035 --> 31:53.822
There will be consequences, Jack.

31:55.039 --> 31:56.870
There always are.

32:21.607 --> 32:25.350
Wait! No. You shouldn't be here.
Just stand back.

32:26.070 --> 32:27.685
Don't say anything.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.158
Alex, you...

32:39.708 --> 32:41.209
Jack?

32:42.378 --> 32:44.585
What the hell did you
bring him here for?

32:44.672 --> 32:46.879
Let him go, Tom.

32:48.217 --> 32:50.048
What's going on, Alex?

32:51.971 --> 32:53.757
This is from Ben.

33:03.023 --> 33:06.641
Ben has commuted Juliet's sentence.

33:06.735 --> 33:10.774
Execution is off the table.
He says the rules don't apply.

33:14.285 --> 33:16.742
He has, however,
ordered her to be marked.

33:45.441 --> 33:47.727
[speaking Thai]

33:56.118 --> 33:58.154
Where're you going?

34:11.133 --> 34:12.293
Hey, I know you.

34:14.261 --> 34:15.842
l'm Achara's friend, from...

34:16.972 --> 34:18.883
Chet, it's Jack from the restaurant.

34:24.521 --> 34:26.182
Let go of me, man!

34:29.276 --> 34:32.234
[all yelling]

34:49.797 --> 34:53.255
You will get off our beach!
You will leave this country!

34:53.342 --> 34:55.503
Do you understand me?

34:59.765 --> 35:01.676
Oh!

35:01.767 --> 35:03.507
[spits]

35:09.191 --> 35:10.852
Man.

35:22.037 --> 35:25.154
[crying]

35:58.574 --> 36:00.439
I heard you only liked them grilled.

36:03.746 --> 36:05.953
I missed the toothpicks too.

36:15.632 --> 36:17.759
- Let me see.
- Jack...

36:17.843 --> 36:20.084
They marked you? Let me see it.

36:41.992 --> 36:44.483
- Break a branch off that aloe plant.
- It's OK.

36:44.578 --> 36:46.534
Please. Please do it.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.295
Turn around.

37:28.330 --> 37:30.195
Why did you help me?

37:30.874 --> 37:35.038
He told you he was gonna let you go
home. He told me the same thing.

37:36.839 --> 37:39.546
We're gonna make sure
he keeps his word.

37:39.633 --> 37:42.249
And how are we going to do that?

37:42.344 --> 37:43.845
Together.

37:56.316 --> 38:00.855
They'll be coming for you
in a few minutes. All of them.

38:02.114 --> 38:03.775
Your friends know where we are.

38:03.866 --> 38:06.983
So we have to leave this island
to go back to where we live.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.405
Go where?

38:10.914 --> 38:12.700
Well, Ben calls it "home."

38:18.672 --> 38:20.208
[Kate] Where's Karl?

38:20.591 --> 38:22.252
I let him go.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.585
- You what?
- I let him go.

38:25.679 --> 38:27.465
He could lead us to where they live.

38:27.556 --> 38:30.639
What, you think I cut him loose
because I'm so damn sensitive?

38:30.726 --> 38:32.512
The kid's a target.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.719
Ben won't stop looking for him...

38:35.814 --> 38:39.727
All Ben wants is that kid
as far from his daughter as possible.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.397
Let's get back to camp.

38:43.947 --> 38:44.936
[scoffs]

38:48.285 --> 38:50.446
Are you coming or not?

38:50.537 --> 38:53.074
Should I walk beside you
or ten paces behind you?

38:54.249 --> 38:57.491
You got so good at telling me
what to do, I can't think for myself.

38:57.586 --> 39:00.168
Don't take it out on me,
because you feel guilty.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.462
- I don't feel guilty.
- The hell you don't.

39:02.549 --> 39:04.790
We had to leave Jack!
I didn't have a choice!

39:04.885 --> 39:07.297
I'm not talking
about leaving Jack behind.

39:12.392 --> 39:15.976
I'm talking about you and me.

39:23.445 --> 39:26.858
I know you did it because
you thought I was a dead man.

39:27.407 --> 39:30.899
So don't beat yourself
up because the doc's left behind.

39:33.956 --> 39:36.197
I'm not beating myself up.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.289
Of course you're not.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.211
So now that we got that
out of the way, let's go.

40:13.203 --> 40:17.572
[Isabel] "He walks amongst us,
but he is not one of us."

40:18.333 --> 40:21.166
Your tattoos, that's what they say.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.916
That's what they say.

40:29.011 --> 40:30.751
It's not what they mean.
