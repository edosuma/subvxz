<i>My name is Earl.</i>

00:04.520 --> 00:08.010
<i>[Earl Narrating] Most people only</i>
<i>go to church on Christmas and Easter.</i>

00:08.120 --> 00:10.380
<i>We're all usually too hungover to go.</i>

00:10.490 --> 00:13.750
<i>But we always try to make it</i>
<i>when they have cheap food and games.</i>

00:14.990 --> 00:17.290
[Slurred Voice]
Hey, dum-dums. I'm hungers.

00:17.390 --> 00:19.620
Uh, me and Randy were eating that.

00:19.730 --> 00:22.560
You'll have to excuseJoy.
She hasn't been winning any prizes.

00:22.670 --> 00:25.570
The only booth she's doing well at
is the wine tasting one.

00:25.670 --> 00:29.570
How are you supposed to win anything
when the church has Jesus on their side?

00:29.670 --> 00:32.470
I mean, you don't think he's the one
bouncing those ping-pong balls...

00:32.580 --> 00:35.200
off the rims of the goldfish bowls?

00:35.310 --> 00:38.800
I won two games
and the grand prize in the raffle-

00:38.920 --> 00:41.480
A.M. -F.M. Radio headphones.

00:42.590 --> 00:45.820
Well, congratulations, Slutty Gonzalez.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.790
You can listen to the radio on the bus.

00:48.890 --> 00:52.120
- We have a car.
- Okay, it's time to go.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.720
- Okay, fine. Give me the keys.
- No.

00:55.830 --> 00:57.890
You've had 25 Dixie cups of wine.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.340
Some of those I threw up.
Now, give me the keys.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.840
No.

01:03.940 --> 01:06.240
I hate you. I'm walking.

01:06.340 --> 01:08.810
Very well, then.

01:08.910 --> 01:13.580
These are the days I'm actually glad
you stole her away from me, Crabman.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.780
I'm glad every day.

01:15.890 --> 01:20.190
<i>[Earl Narrating]Joy's shoe was the first thing</i>
<i>she lost on her drunk walk home.</i>

01:20.290 --> 01:22.260
<i>The second was her mind.</i>

01:25.860 --> 01:28.630
Whoo-hoo!
[Laughing]

01:33.970 --> 01:37.270
## [Headphones: Pop]

01:44.250 --> 01:46.150
Oh, snap.

01:47.820 --> 01:49.720
I killed her!

01:49.820 --> 01:53.310
<i>[Earl Narrating]Joy panicked</i>
<i>and made a beeline to an abandoned shed.</i>

01:53.420 --> 01:55.860
<i>Well, a beeline if the bee was drunk.</i>

01:55.960 --> 01:58.720
- Oh!
- [Gasps]

01:58.830 --> 02:01.320
- Oh, thank God. I thought you were dead.
- <i>[Engine Shuts Off]</i>

02:01.430 --> 02:03.330
And what if I was?

02:03.430 --> 02:07.000
You were just gonna leave my body
to lay here and rot in some dirty shed?

02:07.100 --> 02:09.300
No!

02:09.410 --> 02:14.040
I was gonna pull out all your teeth
and just light everything on fire.

02:14.140 --> 02:17.440
But I don't have to do that now
because you're alive.

02:17.550 --> 02:21.250
So now this will just be
a funny story we tell people.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.980
Yeah, it's a real funny story
I can't wait to tell the police.

02:25.090 --> 02:27.320
[Grunting]
Damn it.

02:27.420 --> 02:29.480
Move this thing back so I can get out.

02:29.590 --> 02:32.590
I got two kids and two strikes.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.600
I can't go to jail.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.260
Joy.

02:36.370 --> 02:40.240
You can scream all you want to,
but nobody's gonna hear you.

02:43.470 --> 02:46.670
Joy!

02:46.780 --> 02:48.970
Okay. That was a lie.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.070
I heard you...

02:51.180 --> 02:54.620
but that's just because I was pretty close
to the shed when you were screaming.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.880
So what I should've said
is you can scream all you want...

02:57.990 --> 02:59.890
and nobody's gonna hear you...

02:59.990 --> 03:02.020
except for me when I'm walking away...

03:02.130 --> 03:05.190
and once I'm far enough away,
I won't hear you anymore.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.020
<i>That is a more accurate statement...</i>

03:07.130 --> 03:11.630
about who will and will not
hear your screaming.

03:15.170 --> 03:17.940
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- [Whimpers]

03:18.040 --> 03:19.940
That psychic was right.

03:20.040 --> 03:23.500
I am gonna die in a shack,
pinned to the wall by a lawn mower.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.370
<i>[Earl Narrating] Me and Randy promised each</i>
<i>other after we lost 50 bucks at the can toss...</i>

03:29.490 --> 03:32.750
<i>we'd walk away, so we did.</i>

03:32.860 --> 03:35.650
Hey, Earl.
Does that guy look familiar to you?

03:35.760 --> 03:37.730
<i>Come on! It's for a good cause!</i>

03:37.830 --> 03:41.630
Give back to your community
and take a shot at Satan!

03:43.400 --> 03:45.300
Yo, man! You gotta warn me!

03:45.400 --> 03:47.130
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Three for a dollar.</i>

03:47.240 --> 03:49.260
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Randy was right to think he looked familiar.</i>

03:49.370 --> 03:51.810
<i>He was number 35 on my list.</i>

03:51.910 --> 03:54.540
<i>A few years back, me and Randy</i>
<i>heard you could make a fortune...</i>

03:54.650 --> 03:56.770
<i>selling organs on the black market.</i>

03:56.880 --> 03:59.610
<i>At the time, we didn't know</i>
<i>they were talking about livers and stuff.</i>

04:03.590 --> 04:08.120
Hello, sir. We're here to pick up the organ
for routine maintenance.

04:08.230 --> 04:10.190
We're trustworthy.

04:11.430 --> 04:13.860
- Come on, Randy.
- I don't know, Earl.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.730
He's a man of God, which means he can
summon the creatures of the Earth to attack us.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.600
You keep saying that, Randy,
but if I remember correctly...

04:20.700 --> 04:24.330
that theory was given to you by a cricket
when you were drunk.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.070
Besides, I'm a man of karma.

04:27.180 --> 04:30.310
I have to trust that it's telling me
the right thing to do.

04:30.410 --> 04:32.380
Come on, gentlemen!
Like to take a shot for a dollar?

04:32.480 --> 04:34.710
Depends. Who's that supposed to be?

04:34.820 --> 04:36.880
Are you serious? It's the devil.

04:36.990 --> 04:39.150
Hmm. I always thought he'd be taller.

04:39.260 --> 04:43.190
Reverend,
l-I'm just gonna cut to the chase here.

04:43.290 --> 04:47.660
I stole your organ. We-We both did, actually.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.960
Thanks, Earl.
He usually doesn't give me credit.

04:51.070 --> 04:54.630
<i>[Earl Narrating] So I told him all about</i>
<i>my list and how I turned my life around...</i>

04:54.740 --> 04:57.640
<i>and then I learned that me and the reverend</i>
<i>weren't that different.</i>

04:57.740 --> 05:00.370
I've been there before.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.110
They used to call me Hash Brown.

05:03.210 --> 05:06.980
I used to roam the streets of Camden,
waiting for somebody to look at me wrong...

05:07.080 --> 05:10.210
just so I could grind their face up
like some hash browns.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.690
Anyway, I was a pretty bad dude.

05:13.790 --> 05:15.690
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Turns out shooting at the devil...</i>

05:15.790 --> 05:18.690
- <i>wasn't the first time the reverend had used a gun.</i>
- [Gunfire]

05:18.800 --> 05:20.760
- <i>[People Screaming]</i>
- Now, I'll ask you one more time.

05:20.860 --> 05:25.030
Is my niece Kiki invited
to your daughter's birthday party?

05:25.140 --> 05:28.570
So I know what it's like
to get your life back on track.

05:28.670 --> 05:31.470
Let us pray.

05:31.580 --> 05:35.480
Heavenly Father, thank you for providing me
with this test of forgiveness...

05:35.580 --> 05:37.550
so I can prove my services to you.

05:37.650 --> 05:40.380
- Amen.
- [Together] Amen.

05:40.480 --> 05:43.850
And don't worry. I can get that organ back
from the people I sold it to.

05:43.950 --> 05:47.550
I hear it survived the Camden circus fire
in perfect condition.

05:47.660 --> 05:49.590
Clowns tried to put that fire out...

05:49.690 --> 05:53.560
but all they had was confetti in their buckets,
and that just made it worse.

05:53.660 --> 05:56.600
They thought they were gonna be heroes.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.760
<i>[Earl Narrating] Me and Randy weren't</i>
<i>the only ones trying to fix mistakes.</i>

05:59.870 --> 06:02.530
Hi, girlfriend. How'd you sleep?

06:02.640 --> 06:04.470
Pinned to the wall, you bitch.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.980
Still a little upset. Understandable.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.910
You haven't eaten in a day.
Brought you some snacks.

06:12.020 --> 06:15.470
- Forgot the drink though.
- How thoughtful.

06:16.850 --> 06:20.480
So, have you changed your mind
about calling the cops?

06:20.590 --> 06:22.790
Hell, no.

06:22.890 --> 06:26.230
Is it because I forgot the drink?
I'll be back.

06:26.330 --> 06:28.460
Oh, please don't leave me here again, Joy.

06:28.570 --> 06:30.800
I won't call the police. I promise.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.230
Joy!

06:34.340 --> 06:37.100
- Joy!
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>

06:37.210 --> 06:38.830
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Me and Randy returned the organ...</i>

06:38.940 --> 06:40.840
<i>and cleared the burnt</i>
<i>clown confetti out of the pipes.</i>

06:40.940 --> 06:44.310
- Do it again, Earl.
- All right. One more time.

07:09.140 --> 07:12.700
The guy who plays Satan in my shooting gallery
dropped the lawsuit...

07:12.810 --> 07:14.940
and now the church's organ is back.

07:15.050 --> 07:17.450
- Earl, I think we're all settled up.
- Awesome.

07:17.550 --> 07:21.140
'Cause Randy had sort of worn out
the "Earl, stop playing with your organ"jokes.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.720
It's funny.

07:23.820 --> 07:27.150
Anyway, I'll just grab my tools and be on my way.

07:27.260 --> 07:29.820
Hold on a second. These are <i>my</i> tools.

07:29.930 --> 07:32.950
- Where'd you buy these?
- Wait. These are <i>your</i> tools?

07:33.060 --> 07:35.620
They have my initials on 'em.

07:38.300 --> 07:42.200
Look, l-I could lie to you,
and I kinda want to...

07:42.310 --> 07:44.770
'cause you already had to forgive me once...

07:44.880 --> 07:47.740
but, well, it looks like
you're on my list twice.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.810
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Back when I was a petty thief...</i>

07:49.910 --> 07:54.080
<i>I used to steal things that were, well, petty.</i>

07:55.490 --> 07:57.040
Hey.

08:02.860 --> 08:05.290
<i>And I used to do things</i>
<i>that were kinda petty too.</i>

08:05.400 --> 08:07.360
Randy, check this out.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.200
<i>Oh!</i>

08:12.300 --> 08:14.200
[Tires Squealing]

08:14.300 --> 08:17.400
- <i>Let me out ofhere! Oh! Oh!</i>
- <i>[Liquid Gurgling]</i>

08:17.510 --> 08:20.870
It landed door down. I had to kick
my way out through the emptying hatch.

08:20.980 --> 08:25.570
I swore whoever had done this,
I was gonna take 'em and put 'em six feet under.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.520
But that was Hash Brown,
and he's dead to us, right?

08:30.620 --> 08:32.350
- Right?
- Right.

08:32.460 --> 08:35.390
Right. I'm different now.

08:35.490 --> 08:38.020
Let us pray!

08:39.500 --> 08:44.730
- [Grunts]
- Dear Lord, thank you for this glorious test.

08:44.840 --> 08:48.860
You're bringing it.
This is some good stuff. You are bringing it.

08:48.970 --> 08:51.600
[Grunts]
Squeezy hand. Hurts a little.

08:51.710 --> 08:53.680
Because, Lord,
you know what the old me would've done.

08:53.780 --> 08:55.540
First, I would've cut open the big one...

08:55.650 --> 08:57.910
<i>then I would've knocked out the little one...</i>

08:58.010 --> 09:01.420
then put the little one inside the big one,
then sewed up the big one.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.450
Then I would've waited and listened
for the little one to scream...

09:04.550 --> 09:07.920
as he woke up inside his own brother.

09:08.020 --> 09:10.720
But not now, Lord. I've changed!

09:10.830 --> 09:12.950
Hand, hand, hand, hand, hand.

09:13.060 --> 09:16.500
I'm a better man because of you, God.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.090
Amen.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.190
- I said amen.
- Amen.

09:23.370 --> 09:26.640
But don't worry, Reverend.
I'll make up for this too.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.940
Earl, if you really wanna make it up...

09:29.050 --> 09:31.010
we need volunteers for Sunday's service.

09:31.110 --> 09:33.240
Of course. We'd love to.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.480
Okay, promise me you won't be mad.

09:40.590 --> 09:42.960
- Joy!
- [Gasps]

09:43.060 --> 09:45.530
Oh, thank God, Crabman. Get me outta here.

09:45.630 --> 09:49.070
Your wife ran me over with this lawn mower
and has kept me pinned here for days.

09:49.170 --> 09:51.600
- We have to call the police.
- See? I knew it!

09:51.700 --> 09:53.970
You lied to me!
You are gonna tell the cops.

09:54.070 --> 09:55.940
<i>Of course I'm gonna tell the cops,</i>
<i>you lunatic.</i>

09:56.040 --> 09:57.530
- Liar!
- Lunatic!

09:57.640 --> 09:59.840
Shut up, everybody.
Just shut up. I gotta think.

09:59.940 --> 10:04.810
I got two strikes. I can't go to jail
for the rest of my life, baby.

10:04.920 --> 10:08.350
Damn it, Joy, I've used every trick I have to
keep you from getting that third strike.

10:08.450 --> 10:10.980
Framed Dodge's principal.
Free crabs for the Asian meter maid.

10:11.090 --> 10:12.990
Replaced the panda at the zoo.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.220
You gotta start thinking
before you get thrown in the big house...

10:15.330 --> 10:16.950
and I'm left raising the boys on my own.

10:17.060 --> 10:20.430
If you don't move this lawn mower soon,
you're both going to jail.

10:20.530 --> 10:22.430
And I'm gonna sell my story to Hollywood...

10:22.530 --> 10:25.500
where they'll make a movie starring
J. Lo as me and Sally Struthers as you!

10:27.570 --> 10:31.700
I told you not to drive drunk, but no!
You couldn't listen to me.

10:31.810 --> 10:33.400
You just do whatever you want
whenever you want...

10:33.510 --> 10:35.980
'cause all that matters to you
is that you're happy.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.810
Well, I hope you're happy now,
'cause we're gonna have to kill her.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.580
- What?
- What?

10:44.320 --> 10:47.980
Darnell, I know I said I wanted your help,
but we can't kill her.

10:48.090 --> 10:50.890
Maybe we can cut out her tongue,
but we can't kill her.

10:50.990 --> 10:54.230
There's nothing we could say to her
to convince her not to go to the cops.

10:54.330 --> 10:57.930
I was taught a very specific moral hierarchy:
God, family, country.

10:58.030 --> 11:01.060
Strippers who threaten my wife appear nowhere
on this list. We've got no other choice.

11:01.170 --> 11:03.570
- We have to kill her.
- Do I have a say in this?

11:03.670 --> 11:06.610
- No.
- But we've been friends for almost 10 years.

11:06.710 --> 11:09.510
And I like you, but I've killed people
I've liked way more than you.

11:11.720 --> 11:15.550
Darnell, I came to you for help
because you're always the voice of reason.

11:15.650 --> 11:19.450
And I still am. Now, you need to shut your hole
and start digging one.

11:31.670 --> 11:33.570
- <i>[Man] Yes, Lord.</i>
- <i>[Congregation Murmuring]</i>

11:33.670 --> 11:35.570
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.

11:35.670 --> 11:38.470
It's a easy thing to say,
but it's a hard thing to do.

11:38.580 --> 11:40.600
- <i>Preach it! Preach!</i>
- Meet my friend here.

11:44.050 --> 11:46.110
- Hi. My name is White.
- <i>[Woman] Huh?</i>

11:46.220 --> 11:48.120
I mean Earl.

11:48.220 --> 11:51.650
Now, this man has done
some pretty terrible things to me.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.950
Earl didn't have to come down here and confess,
but he did.

11:55.060 --> 11:57.460
He told the truth and let it out...

11:57.560 --> 11:59.500
- and I forgave him.
- <i>Yes, Lord.</i>

11:59.600 --> 12:03.660
You see, that there is a twofold test
that God has laid before us.

12:03.770 --> 12:06.630
- Amen.
- Can you confess your sins...

12:06.740 --> 12:09.500
and can you forgive the sins of others?

12:09.610 --> 12:14.070
Now, you know that you done
done something to somebody.

12:14.180 --> 12:17.370
And you also know that somebody...

12:17.480 --> 12:20.350
- has done something to you.
- <i>[Man] Yes, Lord, yes.</i>

12:20.450 --> 12:24.910
But what God is saying-
He-He wants you to let it out.

12:25.020 --> 12:28.790
He doesn't want you
to let it fester all in your gut...

12:28.890 --> 12:32.660
all in your soul,
down in your body, in your bones.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.090
He wants you to let it out!

12:35.200 --> 12:39.500
A lot of times,
when I ask people how they're doing...

12:39.600 --> 12:41.800
I don't really listen to the answer.

12:41.910 --> 12:44.270
I forgive you. Do the church forgive her?

12:44.370 --> 12:46.000
[Congregation]
We forgive you.

12:46.110 --> 12:48.580
- I hate kids.
- Daddy?

12:48.680 --> 12:51.170
I just love sex.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.010
I forgive you. Do the church forgive him?

12:54.120 --> 12:56.110
We forgive you.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.980
I touched a boob on that statue outside.

12:59.090 --> 13:02.020
We forgive you.

13:02.130 --> 13:05.220
It is me who's been farting all service.

13:05.330 --> 13:06.820
We forgive you.

13:06.930 --> 13:08.860
I have something to confess.

13:08.970 --> 13:10.660
My lovely wife, Jackie.

13:10.770 --> 13:14.500
- I slept with Earl.
- You did what?

13:14.600 --> 13:17.570
- [Congregation] We forgive you.
- No, shut up!

13:17.670 --> 13:19.900
You slept with my wife?

13:20.010 --> 13:21.910
Apparently so.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.480
<i>[Earl Narrating] About 10 years back,</i>
<i>me and Randy figured out...</i>

13:24.580 --> 13:26.640
<i>that prison is a great place to pick up chicks.</i>

13:26.750 --> 13:29.310
<i>You just had to do it right.</i>

13:29.420 --> 13:31.910
Thank you so much
for getting me out of jail...

13:32.020 --> 13:35.250
and back home to care
for my sad, lonely wife.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.190
No need to thank me, son. That's what I do.

13:38.290 --> 13:40.390
I'm a prisoner's advocate.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.830
There is one thing I don't understand.

13:42.930 --> 13:45.490
You are expensive because you are the best...

13:45.600 --> 13:48.090
but how could my wife afford your services?

13:48.200 --> 13:50.830
We are so poor.

13:50.940 --> 13:54.380
- She had relations with me.
Now, I know you must be mad.
- Nope.

13:54.480 --> 13:57.450
<i>I am so relieved to be out of prison</i>
<i>that I forgive her.</i>

13:57.550 --> 14:01.920
<i>In fact, I would be angry</i>
<i>if she had not done everything she could.</i>

14:02.020 --> 14:05.250
- Thanks again.
- Enjoy your glorious freedom.

14:06.690 --> 14:10.720
Excuse me.
Can you really help get a prisoner released?

14:10.830 --> 14:13.490
I'll do my best.

14:14.530 --> 14:16.190
Well, you are kind of cute.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.340
Good night, Eddy.

14:22.740 --> 14:25.260
So, while I was in prison...

14:25.380 --> 14:28.070
<i>you were grinding on</i>
<i>Jeff Foxworthy over here?</i>

14:28.180 --> 14:32.770
<i>Reverend, uh, first of all,</i>
<i>thank you aboutJeff Foxworthy.</i>

14:32.880 --> 14:35.850
And regarding your wife,
if it makes you feel better...

14:35.950 --> 14:38.890
it only happened in your house once.

14:38.990 --> 14:40.890
- [Gasping]
- <i>[Congregation Murmuring]</i>

14:42.430 --> 14:44.790
Let us pray.

14:44.890 --> 14:46.560
- O Lord-
- [Gasps]

14:46.660 --> 14:51.460
Please give me the strength to forgive
this lowlife piece of scum...

14:51.570 --> 14:55.440
because you know what Hash Brown
would've done to a man who stole his woman.

14:55.540 --> 14:58.970
- <i>Please give me the strength.</i>
- You seem pretty strong to me.

14:59.080 --> 15:02.310
O Lord, I think I'm failing this test.

15:02.410 --> 15:06.910
- Please help me, Lord.
- Yeah. Please do help him.

15:07.020 --> 15:10.750
<i>Okay, Lord. I guess you want me to be Hash Brown.</i>
<i>That's why you're not helping me.</i>

15:10.850 --> 15:13.580
Fine! You want me to be Hash Brown...

15:14.990 --> 15:17.320
I'll be Hash Brown.

15:17.430 --> 15:18.920
<i>[Congregation Gasps]</i>

15:20.560 --> 15:22.360
[Groans]

15:22.470 --> 15:26.600
<i>You know, sometimes it's hard</i>
<i>to interpret God's</i>-

15:26.700 --> 15:29.260
- <i>[Congregation Gasps]</i>
- I didn't tell you to get up.

15:29.370 --> 15:31.640
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>He had turned into Hash Brown, all right...</i>

15:31.740 --> 15:33.640
<i>and notjust the violence.</i>

15:33.740 --> 15:37.910
Lord, you're the one that convinced me
to stop selling crack.

15:38.010 --> 15:39.950
But the way I see it...

15:40.050 --> 15:42.520
you owe me 10 years of lost income...

15:42.620 --> 15:44.520
so I'm taking some stuff.

15:44.620 --> 15:48.560
I'm taking this candlestick.
I could probably get something for this.

15:48.660 --> 15:51.650
This thing, uh-This is worth some money.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.560
I'm also gonna take those coats
in the Lost and Found.

15:54.660 --> 15:56.660
And this!

15:58.000 --> 16:00.370
Give me this!

16:03.440 --> 16:05.340
Hash Brown is back!

16:11.510 --> 16:14.510
- Reverend Greene!
- Say another word, and I will kill you.

16:14.620 --> 16:16.210
- But-
- I will kill you.

16:20.490 --> 16:23.690
Son of a bitch.

16:23.790 --> 16:26.990
<i>[Earl Narrating] That truck was the last thing</i>
<i>I wanted to see at that moment...</i>

16:27.100 --> 16:30.360
<i>because that meant the reverend</i>
<i>was on my list yet again.</i>

16:30.470 --> 16:33.330
<i>Number 172.</i>

16:33.440 --> 16:36.340
<i>A while back, me and Randy</i>
<i>had snuck into a magic show...</i>

16:36.440 --> 16:40.140
<i>and we were wowed by a trick</i>
<i>that involved catching a bullet in your hand.</i>

16:40.240 --> 16:44.270
<i>Naturally, we decided to give it a shot,</i>
<i>after a case ofbeer.</i>

16:44.380 --> 16:47.110
All right, Randy. Abracadabra.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.110
Oh, crap.

16:50.220 --> 16:52.650
I missed your hand
and blew out that guy's taillight.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.750
Let's get out of here
before we get in trouble.

16:54.860 --> 16:58.390
Well, you didn't miss. I caught the bullet.
I can feel it in my hand.

16:58.490 --> 17:00.360
It's hot...

17:00.460 --> 17:02.290
and bloody.

17:02.400 --> 17:05.890
Oh, God. Oh, God.
[Grunts]

17:06.000 --> 17:09.560
Uh, Reverend, look. I know you said
you'd kill me if I said another word-

17:09.670 --> 17:11.470
Yup, and you just said about eight.

17:11.570 --> 17:15.640
<i>[Earl Narrating] I was scared. Butjust</i>
<i>'cause the reverend had lost his faith in God...</i>

17:15.750 --> 17:17.650
<i>didn't mean I had lost my faith in karma.</i>

17:17.750 --> 17:21.080
A few years back I shot out
the taillight of your truck! Make it quick!

17:21.180 --> 17:23.740
You broke that taillight?

17:23.850 --> 17:27.120
<i>[Earl Narrating] Reverend Greene got</i>
<i>pulled over for having a busted taillight...</i>

17:27.220 --> 17:31.160
<i>but the cops forgot about that pretty quick</i>
<i>once they looked in the back ofhis truck.</i>

17:31.260 --> 17:35.490
AK-47 s, cop-killer bullets,
plastic explosives.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.260
Fine. Those are all legal in this state.

17:38.370 --> 17:40.430
But black market flu shots?

17:40.540 --> 17:42.870
I guess public safety means nothing to you.

17:42.970 --> 17:45.500
[Grunts]

17:45.610 --> 17:48.200
That night I got pulled over...

17:48.310 --> 17:50.910
I was supposed to meet up with my gang.

17:51.010 --> 17:55.510
We were selling some flu shots and some dynamite
to a Dominican gang with the sniffles.

17:55.620 --> 17:57.780
But it all went bad.

17:57.890 --> 18:02.090
Somebody pulled a tissue,
and one of my guys thought it was a gun...

18:02.190 --> 18:03.820
and all hell broke loose.

18:03.930 --> 18:07.060
By the time the smoke cleared...

18:07.160 --> 18:09.360
everybody in my crew was dead.

18:09.470 --> 18:11.300
L-I don't get it.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.890
Earl, if you hadn't broken that taillight...

18:15.000 --> 18:18.960
I would've ended up a dark blob
on a bunch of body parts and Dominican snot.

18:20.780 --> 18:25.010
All this time I've been thinking God
wanted me to forgive you for ruining my life...

18:25.110 --> 18:28.710
but what he wanted was me
to thank you for saving it.

18:28.820 --> 18:30.980
God, huh?

18:31.090 --> 18:33.820
What can you say about that guy?
Isn't he something?

18:40.560 --> 18:43.960
Brothers and sisters, I'm sorry.

18:44.070 --> 18:46.060
[Together]
We forgive you.

18:46.170 --> 18:49.800
#Amazing grace #

18:49.910 --> 18:53.870
# How sweet the sound #

18:53.980 --> 18:56.040
- ## [Continues]
- <i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Me and the reverend had been tested...</i>

18:56.150 --> 18:58.480
<i>and, sure, he had strayed from his path...</i>

18:58.580 --> 19:01.110
<i>but that's the cool thing about having a path.</i>

19:01.220 --> 19:04.810
<i>Even when you get lost, it's still there</i>
<i>waiting for you to find your way back.</i>

19:04.920 --> 19:08.080
# But now I'm found #

19:08.190 --> 19:14.600
#Was blind, but now I see ##

19:14.700 --> 19:18.160
#Amazing grace #

# How sweet the sound #

19:21.570 --> 19:27.570
#That saved a wretch like me ##

19:27.680 --> 19:29.650
I'm not doing this to scare you.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.680
- I'm doing this so it will hurt less.
- Thank you.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.110
You may wanna turn away.

19:37.650 --> 19:39.810
I do apologize for this.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.580
I promise to put flowers
on your shallow, unmarked grave.

19:45.830 --> 19:47.190
Oh!

19:50.100 --> 19:52.360
Joy!

19:52.470 --> 19:54.460
I couldn't let it happen.

19:54.570 --> 19:57.800
I want the Lifetime movie they make about me
to be for something good...

19:57.910 --> 20:00.900
not because I let my husband
murder an immigrant in a shed.

20:01.010 --> 20:02.570
[Engine Starts]

20:07.050 --> 20:09.540
You saved my life.

20:09.650 --> 20:13.450
Ah. Maybe as a thank-you,
you can tell the cops I'm headed to Mexico...

20:13.560 --> 20:17.150
since I'm going to Canada,
our white neighbors to the north.

20:17.260 --> 20:20.890
How about as a thank-you,
I don't tell the cops anything at all?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.970
Seriously?

20:23.070 --> 20:26.500
Anyone who gives their husband a concussion
to save me from getting my throat slit...

20:26.600 --> 20:28.500
is okay by me.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.660
That's why I'm still friends
with my bitchy cousin Judy.

20:30.770 --> 20:35.010
I forgive you for all of this, Joy.
I forgive you.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.910
Thank you so much!

20:38.010 --> 20:39.710
[Sniffs]
Hmm.

20:39.820 --> 20:43.250
I knew if I ever hugged you, you were
gonna smell like burritos and stripper pole.

20:43.350 --> 20:47.950
Tease me all you want.
Now I know you love me.
