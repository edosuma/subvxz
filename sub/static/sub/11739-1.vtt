You do not want to cut off.

Do you have a few options.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.668
Pay attention.

01:39.859 --> 01:41.854
You can hold her head
and cut his throat.

A good choice.

02:03.006 --> 02:04.667
It's all yours, do it well.

02:04.710 --> 02:07.715
Use your body weight and
pushes carry the knife.

02:24.548 --> 02:26.922

02:27.800 --> 02:29.223
Is that all?

02:30.375 --> 02:31.665
Is that all you got?

02:32.856 --> 02:34.922
This is the man who killed your brother.

02:35.528 --> 02:38.328
He tortured and maimed ...

02:38.448 --> 02:39.821

02:39.872 --> 02:43.440

He is dead.

03:09.391 --> 03:11.053
Well, he's dead.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.385
He's already dead. Well done.

05:36.443 --> 05:38.345
<i>To survive in my world ...</i>

You're a hard man.

05:51.801 --> 05:55.280

what you need.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.059
After all ready ...

05:57.179 --> 05:59.444
I'm sure we're both rich.

05:59.494 --> 06:01.007
So be prepared ..

06:01.439 --> 06:02.670
What is that?

06:02.789 --> 06:04.840
It's Cinco de Mayo, partner.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.876
Stupid people shooting like crazy.

06:11.248 --> 06:13.908
I can not imagine where
this shit is custom.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.935
But they do every year.

06:15.983 --> 06:18.376

- Johnny Solo.

06:18.496 --> 06:20.787
- Okay, Johnny ..
- Just ...

06:20.987 --> 06:22.640
Johnny Solo.

06:23.554 --> 06:25.092
Johnny Solo.

06:25.212 --> 06:29.119
The death of a Mafia legend
Carlo Manfreddi is great news.

06:29.509 --> 06:31.762
But we know that he had
an illegitimate child.

06:31.882 --> 06:35.967
And we know that his son was trying to
kill green offering 1.000.000.

06:36.610 --> 06:38.604
Carlo Jr. will inherit a
million dollars ...

06:38.646 --> 06:40.732
And I do not think I want to share.

06:40.852 --> 06:42.602
And you know who he is.

06:42.722 --> 06:44.929
So, what if we start?

06:46.823 --> 06:47.921
Do you have the money?

06:48.041 --> 06:51.678
The money will be transferred
to your account as agreed.

06:53.382 --> 06:55.495
You do not laugh like that, mate.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.530

07:07.927 --> 07:08.945

07:09.011 --> 07:09.908
<i>You're Johnny?</i>

07:10.087 --> 07:11.564
What? Burt.

07:11.684 --> 07:13.831
Do you have anything to Mr. Manfredi?

07:13.951 --> 07:15.028
Of course.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.085
Okay, you got an hour.

07:17.205 --> 07:19.399
- I have at least two.
- Two?

07:19.638 --> 07:22.902
It's hot, and not
I walk with heavy clothing.

07:23.348 --> 07:26.054
- What?
- I just got off the plane.

07:26.174 --> 07:28.920
I'm not armed, presumably
you have to be my protector.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.549
<i>There will be, I believe me.</i>

07:30.598 --> 07:32.388
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

07:32.421 --> 07:34.136
You have until the two.

07:40.837 --> 07:42.798
Let's start.

07:42.918 --> 07:45.986
I'll tell you about some
cold-blooded killers.

07:50.268 --> 07:51.146
<i>Roman.</i>

07:51.186 --> 07:53.752
<i>Your mother died six months ago.</i>

07:53.872 --> 07:55.308
<i>They were very close.</i>

07:55.428 --> 07:56.867
<i>It was a classy lady.</i>

07:56.987 --> 07:59.327
<i>Roman changed since she died.</i>

08:00.477 --> 08:01.769
<i>Anthony.</i>

08:01.889 --> 08:03.464
<i>It's all a bitch.</i>

08:03.516 --> 08:04.991
<i>grew up in the streets.</i>

08:05.028 --> 08:07.912
<i>Your mother was an addict,
and doing drugs for him.</i>

08:08.032 --> 08:09.332
<i>is also smart.</i>

08:09.380 --> 08:11.327
<i>not even fined.</i>

08:13.145 --> 08:15.051
<i>Grace is an orphan.</i>

08:15.171 --> 08:16.445
<i>She was raised by the state.</i>

08:17.008 --> 08:20.240
<i>then tried his stepfather
rape as a teenager ...</i>

08:20.277 --> 08:22.697
<i>He cut cock and gave it to the dog.</i>

08:27.020 --> 08:28.178
Why are you late?

08:28.944 --> 08:31.327
I had to deal with a personal matter.

08:32.607 --> 08:34.054
Okay?

08:39.043 --> 08:41.130
Maybe it's better not
drink while working.

08:42.162 --> 08:43.486
Calm down, Grace.

08:44.001 --> 08:44.910
What?

08:45.942 --> 08:47.152
Nothing.

08:47.963 --> 08:49.478
Let Roman, I know you.

08:49.898 --> 08:51.764
Baby when you are depressed.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.379
Want to come to my
house to calm you?

08:55.666 --> 08:59.204
We both know what
It will happen if I go to your house.

09:02.194 --> 09:04.902
I appreciate the offer, but no.

09:27.198 --> 09:28.294
Do you want a beer?

09:32.181 --> 09:34.170
I ask you, do you
by this or not?

09:41.071 --> 09:42.156
Follows.

10:23.832 --> 10:24.853
Is everything alright?

10:25.891 --> 10:27.321
Take off everything.

10:27.384 --> 10:28.661
Put it in the bag.

10:32.092 --> 10:33.415
Sweeping.

10:40.096 --> 10:40.896
Toma.

10:40.975 --> 10:42.479
This is the best.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.559
You can use any clean
and they can be destroyed.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.477
So ...

10:49.456 --> 10:50.667
What are you doing then?

10:50.944 --> 10:52.571
I'm a producer.

10:54.590 --> 10:56.414
I produce a TV show.

10:57.584 --> 10:59.780
Producer? You must be rich.

10:59.900 --> 11:00.972
I do.

11:01.046 --> 11:03.179
If you need brother
money, why not come to you?

11:03.299 --> 11:05.960
I'm his younger brother,
She was embarrassed to be me.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.543
Pride, right?

11:08.095 --> 11:09.814
You feel
proud tonight.

11:10.074 --> 11:12.734
So you're producing ...

11:12.808 --> 11:13.760
Right?

11:15.070 --> 11:17.395

11:22.833 --> 11:25.296

11:25.721 --> 11:27.641
That's good, because ..

11:27.891 --> 11:29.612
I have not shit.

11:31.814 --> 11:33.001
So you and me ...

11:34.411 --> 11:36.443
We never meet more.

11:37.706 --> 11:39.534
We will not see us.

11:41.046 --> 11:41.894
Look at me.

11:42.074 --> 11:42.874
Look at me.

11:43.042 --> 11:44.734
Look at me. Look at me.

11:48.105 --> 11:49.774
When you see my face again ...

11:50.905 --> 11:52.367
You screwed.

11:52.597 --> 11:53.396
Agreed.

11:53.615 --> 11:55.349
I am going to kill you.

11:58.402 --> 11:59.990
- You understand?
- Yes.

12:59.845 --> 13:02.707
My friend told me that
care of his dog poo.

13:02.757 --> 13:04.656
He went to New York for a week.

13:07.971 --> 13:09.466
I do not know. Chihuahua?

13:09.540 --> 13:13.486
My cat hates dogs so
they are always fighting.

13:14.677 --> 13:16.711
<i>Jason Donatelli my boss.</i>

13:16.780 --> 13:18.652
<i>Its core business
is bookmaker.</i>

13:18.772 --> 13:20.680

13:20.723 --> 13:23.520
<i>So I assumed that if I could find
Carlo's son Manfreddi ...</i>

13:23.584 --> 13:24.978
<i>Create.</i>

13:25.675 --> 13:26.499
To wait.

13:26.908 --> 13:27.898
The!

13:28.574 --> 13:31.307
The open door of hell!

13:33.275 --> 13:35.020
In short, they fight.

13:35.084 --> 13:37.046
I thought, fuck it, I'm not
in order to cope with this new ...

13:37.103 --> 13:40.148
I'll let you decide who wins.

13:40.706 --> 13:44.378
5 minutes later, my cat
dragging the dog in my living room.

13:45.102 --> 13:45.990
Yes.

13:46.357 --> 13:47.719
My cat killed the chihuahua.

13:47.778 --> 13:50.481
And I brought it as
a kind of trophy.

13:51.188 --> 13:53.016
Now I have to face my girlfriend.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.196
It has nothing in her purse.

13:55.316 --> 13:57.431
- Fuck.
- Where's Clarence?

13:57.551 --> 14:00.107
- I have to go.

14:06.935 --> 14:10.014
<i>He brings the collection,
40.000 grand in cash.</i>

14:10.134 --> 14:12.609
<i>I waited 3 hours.</i>

14:17.581 --> 14:19.278
<i>I called home, mobile ...</i>

14:19.349 --> 14:20.205
<i>nothing.</i>

14:20.325 --> 14:21.902
There was no answer.

14:23.758 --> 14:25.708
Hey, did you bring any big rat?

14:26.565 --> 14:28.272
- Chihuahua.
- Wait a second.

14:28.472 --> 14:31.685

14:31.738 --> 14:34.005
Yes, and still he had more
rounds do tonight ..

14:34.032 --> 14:35.834
And my schedule is already full.

14:35.954 --> 14:38.433
He could not rely on that shit.

14:39.698 --> 14:41.709

14:41.969 --> 14:44.156
Do you think he's trying
lost the ticket?

14:44.198 --> 14:45.321
I do not know.

14:45.821 --> 14:47.565
Go home, see if he's there.

14:47.597 --> 14:48.522
Why?

14:49.118 --> 14:50.138

14:50.542 --> 14:51.813
I'll get the bastard.

14:51.882 --> 14:53.595

14:53.715 --> 14:54.807
In order to collect betting.

14:55.301 --> 14:56.450
Do it.

14:56.570 --> 14:57.689
Johnny wants.

14:57.809 --> 14:58.992
Come on, mate ...

14:59.045 --> 15:00.247

15:02.543 --> 15:04.365
Find it, he's got my package.

15:50.151 --> 15:52.598

I have another job for you.

16:22.126 --> 16:23.773
Thank you.

16:25.011 --> 16:26.523

16:26.549 --> 16:29.455
It's tea, dick. A special blend.

It keeps me sharp.

16:35.717 --> 16:38.561

16:48.353 --> 16:52.190
No, I do not know, so I just murder him.

What about Roman?

17:04.914 --> 17:06.250

17:46.561 --> 17:48.207
No no.

17:48.855 --> 17:51.140
- Everything is fine.
- Great.

17:51.191 --> 17:54.530
<i>Because you familiar Carlo Jr.
those pictures, nothing else.</i>

17:54.589 --> 17:58.882
<i>And you know who will be the leader of the family
Soon he would be disappointed or not.</i>

17:58.983 --> 18:00.719
<i>Very disappointed.</i>

18:01.064 --> 18:04.416
Tell him not to worry.
I can handle it.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.490
<i>So you're going to find the guy?</i>

18:08.767 --> 18:10.136
Of course.

18:10.254 --> 18:11.540
- But ...
- Good.

18:11.607 --> 18:14.938
<i>I will go there, for sure
give me protection.</i>

18:17.946 --> 18:19.195
Agreed.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.742
Agreed.

18:27.308 --> 18:28.570
Hey?

18:29.234 --> 18:32.374
Come on in, I'm in the room.

18:37.289 --> 18:38.723
What have you done?

18:38.791 --> 18:42.404
I was at a dinner with Shelly
and my card was canceled.

18:44.419 --> 18:47.969
I added the music, I found
It would be a nice touch.

18:48.695 --> 18:52.174
Do you feel in your
womb? Did you feel it?

18:52.908 --> 18:57.545
It was only a small part of what
I felt when we fuck for the first time.

18:57.633 --> 19:00.317
- Roman ...
- In my house? In my bed?

19:00.350 --> 19:01.917
Roman does not mean to me.

19:01.950 --> 19:03.737
I think you should go.

19:04.262 --> 19:07.092
Can not you calm down a little?

19:26.121 --> 19:28.566
If you do not want to go ...

19:29.329 --> 19:33.988
It can be the same
hole where I your little friend.

19:35.512 --> 19:37.213
Would you like that?

19:37.941 --> 19:39.129
No.

19:40.865 --> 19:43.442
Then, out of my house.

19:44.302 --> 19:47.989
Fuck my house.

19:51.968 --> 19:54.133
Leave the car keys.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.619
Given my black move
ass here in the Valley.

20:13.672 --> 20:15.907
I hate the damn Valley.

20:26.327 --> 20:28.089
Hello, beautiful.

20:28.133 --> 20:31.416
Good to see you again,
Have you seen Clarence?

20:31.574 --> 20:33.546
My name is not pretty.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.478
Oh, yeah, what if some
the damn door?

20:36.539 --> 20:38.187
Smart ass.

20:38.307 --> 20:40.107
Whore.

20:42.403 --> 20:44.963
Oh really?

20:45.306 --> 20:48.058
I now love sex tantico.

20:48.778 --> 20:52.895
Yes, I can last up
6 hours is crazy.

20:53.386 --> 20:56.481
No. Everything is fine. Not
it will come to you.

20:57.405 --> 21:00.167
I will call you later.

21:00.316 --> 21:02.464
We can talk later.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.745
Okay, bye.

21:05.779 --> 21:07.217
My friend.

21:07.252 --> 21:09.391
Close the door.

21:18.415 --> 21:20.450
What is it?

21:20.466 --> 21:22.773
I've heard that drinking beer
now at work.

21:22.807 --> 21:24.314
Grace told you that?

21:24.429 --> 21:27.558
Worried, I thought
you were soft.

21:27.593 --> 21:29.777
I see that you drink.

21:29.821 --> 21:33.775
What do you mean?
It is tea. Special mix.

21:34.144 --> 21:36.463
I'm not there
outside, killing people.

21:36.542 --> 21:40.566
No, you're just sitting
and here it all handling.

21:40.618 --> 21:43.384
And speaking of home, I moved.

21:43.402 --> 21:47.121
So if you need to contact me,
do it in the cave now.

21:47.138 --> 21:48.296
Does the cave?

21:48.322 --> 21:50.549
Yes, my little apartment,
Do you have his number?

21:50.593 --> 21:54.317
Yes, I remember. But,
Why did you move?

21:57.885 --> 22:01.041
Do you know? I know you
long.

22:01.085 --> 22:02.742
So I'm going to speak out.

22:02.786 --> 22:06.275
They need to fix their stuff together.

22:06.477 --> 22:07.459
Yes.

22:07.983 --> 22:09.088
Did you read it?

22:09.114 --> 22:11.192
No, I began to read, but ...

22:11.244 --> 22:13.989
Everything he says is
contradicts my entire life.

22:14.006 --> 22:16.101
It started to bother me.

22:16.162 --> 22:17.565
love women.

22:17.685 --> 22:18.924
Look at this.

22:19.044 --> 22:21.627
This guy sucks.

22:21.747 --> 22:25.784
He says foreign currency ...

22:25.819 --> 22:28.335
brings internal change.

22:28.352 --> 22:31.167
It is one of the reasons
why I stopped drinking.

22:31.479 --> 22:34.319
You should try this.

22:34.439 --> 22:37.115
Yeah, you know I do not like.

22:37.185 --> 22:41.787
Everything he says is
if you do ...

22:41.812 --> 22:45.823
much like a chicken, gamble
What? You're a chicken spirit.

22:45.866 --> 22:48.505
I do not know if you've seen
Mirror recently ...

22:48.549 --> 22:52.982
But you look like an imitation
Chimba ugly Lenny Kravitz.

22:53.102 --> 22:55.638
Well, A, Lenny Kravitz was attractive.

22:55.717 --> 22:59.743
And B, you should look
in the mirror, okay?

22:59.928 --> 23:02.286
Be careful, damn it. Attentively.

23:02.303 --> 23:03.907
It is yours.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.666
- Woody ...
- What?

23:13.903 --> 23:15.884
- Woody ...
- Yes?

23:17.752 --> 23:19.375
Who wants this?

23:19.884 --> 23:22.119
You know I can not tell you.

23:23.276 --> 23:25.275
Anthony wants ...

23:25.648 --> 23:28.076
Grace to you and work with him.

23:28.567 --> 23:30.400
Do you want?

23:33.365 --> 23:34.627
Yes.

23:34.961 --> 23:36.565
Good.

23:36.643 --> 23:38.774
Go now. I have a lot
things to do.

24:06.577 --> 24:07.700
Yes, Woody?

24:07.726 --> 24:08.708
Where are you?

24:08.752 --> 24:09.890
I'm a little busy right now.

24:09.918 --> 24:11.882
I need to accelerate their business.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.910
I need to check a Roman ..

24:14.024 --> 24:17.329
Something happened, I want you
it out and remove it.

24:17.365 --> 24:19.082
Delete what bothers him?

24:19.117 --> 24:20.057
Just do it.

24:20.058 --> 24:21.858
Will give you a bonus?

24:22.038 --> 24:25.572
Okay, finding,
remove. You will get your bonus.

24:31.201 --> 24:33.638
Do you know? every time I start
to relax and have fun ...

24:33.664 --> 24:37.557
That guy always irritated me
flame with any nonsense.

24:41.095 --> 24:43.366
Have you thought about retiring?

24:44.488 --> 24:46.389
To lead a normal life?

24:47.556 --> 24:49.905
This is normal for me.

24:50.852 --> 24:52.992
Then abnormal life.

24:54.279 --> 24:55.936
I am serious.

24:56.751 --> 24:58.715
A house in the countryside ...

24:59.039 --> 25:00.913
a few dogs ...

25:01.553 --> 25:03.324
a garden.

25:04.420 --> 25:05.779
No.

25:06.217 --> 25:09.059
I see that in my future.

25:10.014 --> 25:12.399
You have to leave this one day.

25:13.838 --> 25:16.503
Yes, I think so.

25:20.692 --> 25:22.596
I have to go.

26:04.190 --> 26:06.179
Want to work for me?

26:06.258 --> 26:08.814
- Do you know of your job?
- Yes.

26:10.006 --> 26:11.926
I'm sure you know.

26:13.665 --> 26:15.330
To wait!

26:15.374 --> 26:18.057
Wait, come on ...

26:22.379 --> 26:24.846
Oh my God.

26:28.236 --> 26:31.106
This was not of 6 hours.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.270
Hey, Woody.

26:36.774 --> 26:38.938
The Amazing Grace.

26:39.061 --> 26:40.750
This is a surprise.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.089
- Hello Grace.
- Hey.

26:42.140 --> 26:43.810
You. They are known?

26:43.848 --> 26:45.997
Yes it is.

26:49.721 --> 26:51.484
Again next week?

26:52.597 --> 26:54.874
Thanks for the time.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.495
What was that?

26:58.513 --> 27:01.341
There is an atmosphere in this room.

27:01.396 --> 27:03.887
- Also you are not satisfied?
- Yes.

27:03.906 --> 27:05.866
Not in the same way, but it does.

27:05.893 --> 27:08.005
Because I'm the best.

27:08.041 --> 27:09.405
What business do you have for me?

27:09.424 --> 27:12.279
A mutual friend has a hit.

27:13.535 --> 27:15.397
Did you talk with Roman?

27:16.389 --> 27:17.628
What you got for me, Woody?

27:17.655 --> 27:19.864
Grace, I asked to speak with Roman.

27:19.883 --> 27:23.036
No, you said you wanted to talk
me to come right?

27:23.155 --> 27:25.953
Well, that's good.

27:26.073 --> 27:27.573
Well well ..

27:28.911 --> 27:30.546
Will give you a bonus?

27:30.564 --> 27:31.883
What?

27:31.947 --> 27:33.252
I can save that money.

27:33.279 --> 27:35.665
You want to do a bonus for the right?

27:35.936 --> 27:38.402
No, I do not think so.

27:41.941 --> 27:43.170
How much?

27:43.197 --> 27:44.950
80 large.

27:50.292 --> 27:52.488
Well, the amazing Grace.

27:52.608 --> 27:56.956
Do you know? If you only give him
every time ahead ...

27:56.992 --> 27:59.515
I have no money, Woody.

27:59.562 --> 28:01.566
What have you got for me?

28:01.666 --> 28:03.102
Good job.

28:03.222 --> 28:07.025
Anthony and his in Roman
matter, but they want you.

28:07.145 --> 28:08.760
I thought you had left.

28:09.483 --> 28:11.109
It is tea.

28:12.094 --> 28:14.651
Good tea.

28:20.605 --> 28:22.177
What?

28:22.394 --> 28:23.749
You are a pig.

28:23.794 --> 28:28.002
Come on, I'm just
with a little fun.

28:28.122 --> 28:30.842
Even if I knew where he was,
Why should I tell you?

28:30.895 --> 28:33.742
Shut up and do what you do.

28:37.863 --> 28:40.131
You're a good man.

28:40.158 --> 28:42.326
I bet you're a lady killer.

28:42.390 --> 28:45.880
If you do not shut up, I'll kill you.

28:49.169 --> 28:53.488
Coverage, they will not teach you
no modesty?

28:53.533 --> 28:57.340
Fuck you, you can not treat
if one of your black friends.

28:57.502 --> 28:59.058
What do you say?

28:59.642 --> 29:02.462
What the fuck you tell me?

29:02.938 --> 29:05.097
Clarence me never told.

29:05.133 --> 29:07.049
He treats me well.

29:07.157 --> 29:08.753
Have you treated well?

29:08.916 --> 29:12.676
Bitch, you're just in
crap hole.

29:12.712 --> 29:16.365
Clarence for you at home, alone
giving him some drugs and drink.

29:16.410 --> 29:19.764
And all you want to do is
Move that ass to meet him.

29:19.809 --> 29:21.572
Yes, bitch. That's life.

29:21.599 --> 29:24.087
Let me tell you something, you're nothing.

29:24.123 --> 29:28.197
You're just a cheap white whore
live in a house in the valley.

29:28.413 --> 29:34.316
You can look better in the mirror
for telling me about my black girlfriends.

29:35.325 --> 29:37.335
I interrupt something?

29:37.371 --> 29:38.819
This called me black.

29:38.845 --> 29:40.240
No, he's lying.

29:40.276 --> 29:42.912
Shut up. Yes, what is it?

29:44.271 --> 29:46.473
Speak slowly ...

29:48.809 --> 29:50.661
What's your name, sweetheart?

29:50.787 --> 29:52.235
Kate.

29:52.803 --> 29:56.860
Kate, I'm Jason. The head of your boyfriend.

29:57.175 --> 29:59.126
Can I get you something to drink?

29:59.171 --> 30:00.091
No thanks.

30:00.118 --> 30:02.402
If I had known that you go
come, I would have cleaned.

30:02.420 --> 30:04.461
Do not worry, the place looks great.

30:04.506 --> 30:06.010
Where's Clarence?

30:06.091 --> 30:08.097
I do not know.

30:08.384 --> 30:10.012
Not your car in the street?

30:10.075 --> 30:12.000
I did not know there was a car in the street.

30:12.028 --> 30:13.206
Kate ...

30:13.700 --> 30:17.279
I do not lie, right?
I need to talk to him.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.962
No, I'm not lying.

30:20.034 --> 30:21.706
I do not know, I have not seen.

30:21.732 --> 30:25.178
They found Clarence,
someone upset.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.642
What do you mean stripping?

30:26.758 --> 30:29.006
They gutted like a fish.

30:29.447 --> 30:30.634
He is dead.

30:30.679 --> 30:33.205
Oh God. Oh God.

30:33.259 --> 30:35.507
Shut up!

30:36.407 --> 30:38.682
- What about the package?
- Nothing.

30:39.794 --> 30:42.123
I can not believe this is happening.

30:42.366 --> 30:43.751
- Was it a murder for hire?
- I do not know.

30:43.771 --> 30:46.649
But I think there is a
been possible.

30:46.694 --> 30:50.102
Ford Woody, dammit.

30:50.303 --> 30:53.542
Wait, what about me?
What should I do?

30:55.313 --> 30:58.831
What the ...? Why did you do that?

30:58.849 --> 31:00.998
I want my package.

31:05.162 --> 31:07.548
- What have you done?
- What do you think?

31:07.668 --> 31:10.470
Wait, I'm
a little confused.

31:10.506 --> 31:12.584
You said you pay them
with poker chips?

31:12.620 --> 31:14.751
Did you just heard of poker chips?

31:14.769 --> 31:19.230
See? You're the only
He does not know what he is talking about.

31:19.266 --> 31:22.972
No, said casino chips.

31:23.296 --> 31:26.597
Well, let's say
you want to murder someone ...

31:26.614 --> 31:30.517
5 large, receive an e-mail to
and you can use it for 48 hours.

31:30.561 --> 31:35.904
If you need to do this, Woody reads,
It sets the price, and give you instructions.

31:35.940 --> 31:39.376
You can even pay with
credit card if you wish.

31:39.393 --> 31:41.068
Woody confirm payment ...

31:41.148 --> 31:42.838
and hired the killer.

31:42.964 --> 31:44.997
So, paid half of you?

31:45.590 --> 31:47.202
It's not about Starsky and Hutch, partner.

31:47.238 --> 31:49.999
No pay first half, you have
to pay for everything.

31:50.026 --> 31:55.124
When the work is done, they give
chips and the change in the Bank of Solo.

31:55.178 --> 31:56.842
- Do the change?
- Yes.

31:56.905 --> 32:00.173
I have contacts in all
Las Vegas casinos.

32:00.201 --> 32:03.969
Good business, but the cards
credit can be traced.

32:04.013 --> 32:08.584
must each tab of $ 5.000
reviewed by the head of the casino ...

32:08.612 --> 32:10.380
To verify that
He won on the table.

32:10.416 --> 32:15.047
First, computer security
do not allow anyone to investigate.

32:15.101 --> 32:18.879
To further complicate things,
creates many fake accounts.

32:18.915 --> 32:21.298
More ports, more domains.

32:21.343 --> 32:25.233
He is the only one who can
Yes, he's a fucking genius.

32:25.287 --> 32:30.431
Never mistake handling companies
casino mafia thugs.

32:30.440 --> 32:34.202
Do you think employees
Casinos pay them enough?

32:34.228 --> 32:37.147
Please, capitalism,
everyone has his share.

32:37.164 --> 32:41.310
And no one knows who kills
that in addition to this, Woody?

32:57.130 --> 32:59.702
What the ...?

33:02.540 --> 33:06.467
- Yes?
- Woody, Jason Donatelli.

33:06.587 --> 33:08.063
As a long time huh?

33:08.130 --> 33:09.647
What is it, Jason?

33:09.783 --> 33:11.665
I just want to talk.

33:11.731 --> 33:14.689
You know how I work, there is
to follow the protocol.

33:14.767 --> 33:17.510
This is great, Woody. I can not wait.

33:17.970 --> 33:20.186
Lots of money.

33:33.199 --> 33:34.933
You need to relax.

33:34.954 --> 33:36.508
Where's my package?

33:36.551 --> 33:38.925
I do not know what you mean.

33:39.307 --> 33:40.107
Lie.

33:40.141 --> 33:41.280
Well ...

33:41.315 --> 33:44.488
Well, you have to calm down.

33:45.186 --> 33:46.208
And asking try.

33:46.237 --> 33:48.712
Well, I wonder.

33:48.832 --> 33:50.862
Clarence Foster, it was you?

33:50.982 --> 33:53.218
I think you broke my nose, dammit.

33:53.338 --> 33:54.989
I'm losing patience.

33:55.109 --> 33:58.849
First, if you murder me,
You get information.

33:58.969 --> 34:00.704
Second ...

34:02.193 --> 34:05.846
If you ever sign
Again, the better you murder me.

34:06.288 --> 34:08.620
Clarence who?

34:08.739 --> 34:10.123
Foster.

34:10.244 --> 34:13.074
- He was slain, you go?
- How long have you worked?

34:13.195 --> 34:14.396
6 months.

34:14.516 --> 34:17.621
Well, we have not done
business for ...

34:17.742 --> 34:19.940
2 or 3 years?

34:23.495 --> 34:26.145
If you know who slain
one of my men ...

34:26.264 --> 34:27.981
And I did nothing ...

34:28.101 --> 34:29.688
I stay like a dog.

34:30.059 --> 34:31.514
I'm not a dog.

34:31.635 --> 34:33.744
That is in sight.

34:34.292 --> 34:36.576
However, I understand your position.

34:36.696 --> 34:39.246
Come on, let's be rational.

34:39.364 --> 34:43.650
Both are businessmen, I am
that there is a figure at this point.

34:44.891 --> 34:46.591
So it was a contract killing.

34:47.135 --> 34:48.646
Fuck.

34:49.041 --> 34:50.554
Did you get a contract
one of my boys

34:50.583 --> 34:52.411
and you did not even
the courage to tell me?

34:52.440 --> 34:54.842
It's not as if it were
around with a plate

34:54.893 --> 34:56.612
to say ...

34:56.665 --> 34:58.896
"I'm the dog Jason." Right?

34:58.946 --> 35:01.075
I had no idea that was on your computer.

35:01.156 --> 35:02.451
Honestly ...

35:02.496 --> 35:04.390
It does not matter about any of these species.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.399
But if you want to talk
business talk.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.743
otherwise, get out of my house.

35:13.002 --> 35:15.258
You said there was a package.

35:15.666 --> 35:16.575
What do you say?

35:16.968 --> 35:19.017
Tell me who ordered the killings.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.636
You know I can not tell you.

35:21.695 --> 35:23.151
I pay.

35:23.180 --> 35:24.837
Give me your name.

35:25.853 --> 35:27.199
What's in the package?

35:27.430 --> 35:28.230
Pictures.

35:29.053 --> 35:30.493
And if I can not find ...

35:30.769 --> 35:33.854
Criminals of a chief
New York come on my ass.

35:34.153 --> 35:35.893
And I will send after you.

35:40.211 --> 35:43.563
It has to do with Carlo Manfreddi Jr.?

35:44.915 --> 35:45.974
50 large.

35:46.021 --> 35:47.086
You're funny.

35:47.143 --> 35:48.853
100.000.

35:53.443 --> 35:54.479
I ..

35:55.204 --> 35:56.074
Half ..

35:56.799 --> 35:57.985
Yours.

36:07.565 --> 36:09.433
This is the kind that
He hired the killers.

36:10.002 --> 36:10.976
Keep it ...

36:11.314 --> 36:12.310
discreet.

36:14.802 --> 36:16.126
If this shit is a lie ...

36:16.517 --> 36:19.904
I'll have a bust ass.

36:21.884 --> 36:23.782
It smells here.

36:31.050 --> 36:33.675
- Sorry.
- Okay.

36:33.795 --> 36:35.874
You are very emotional today.

36:35.914 --> 36:37.243
Wisely.

36:38.699 --> 36:40.511
I hate my job.

36:41.852 --> 36:45.321
But I feel that my job is how
I am so I hate myself.

36:45.967 --> 36:47.803
Do not say that, Grace.

36:47.923 --> 36:51.039
It's just your job, not you.

36:51.483 --> 36:53.695
After all, look what you have.

36:53.735 --> 36:55.000
I want your job.

36:55.324 --> 36:56.572
No ...

36:57.377 --> 37:00.076
No, believe me. you have no idea.

37:00.859 --> 37:02.648
Do something else.

37:05.339 --> 37:07.302
What can I do?

37:33.354 --> 37:34.154
What?

37:35.307 --> 37:37.696
No, nothing, nothing, but ...

37:38.214 --> 37:40.830
If you do not want your name in the place
front, maybe you can put "Lair" ...

37:40.875 --> 37:41.991
or some shit.

37:42.055 --> 37:44.925
Because I hate all the bubbles
only to find the door.

37:44.982 --> 37:47.491
- Not my problem.
- I'm just saying.

37:49.411 --> 37:51.846
So this is ... the cave.

37:52.283 --> 37:53.602
What does that mean?

37:54.057 --> 37:54.857
What?

37:55.547 --> 37:57.774
Enabling the
voice makes me believe ...

37:57.826 --> 37:59.282
Did you mean something.

37:59.341 --> 38:00.807
Actually there is a tipping point.

38:00.871 --> 38:02.863
- Yes, there is.
- No.

38:02.915 --> 38:05.079
maybe subconsciously
I was thinking ...

38:05.317 --> 38:07.130
Why is this place called the study.

38:07.187 --> 38:08.815
Because that's what it is.

38:08.879 --> 38:10.261
It has a kitchen, right?

38:10.323 --> 38:12.262
Many people have
kitchen in a cave.

38:12.321 --> 38:14.761
Do you know? It is by definition a cave ...

38:14.829 --> 38:16.965
the home of the wild animals.

38:17.085 --> 38:19.084
The wolf who lives in a cave.

38:19.204 --> 38:21.455
I identify myself as a wolf.

38:21.575 --> 38:23.550
And this is my cave.

38:23.670 --> 38:25.679
Well, if you know that the wolves ...

38:25.799 --> 38:27.380
They live in herds, not just life.

38:27.437 --> 38:29.993
Yes, but have you ever heard
talk about the lone wolf?

38:30.113 --> 38:31.997
A lone wolf?

38:32.117 --> 38:34.742
He lives alone in the forest and ...

38:34.834 --> 38:36.924
You do what you need
do, and at the end of the day ...

38:37.044 --> 38:38.798
returns to his lair.

38:38.841 --> 38:41.598
Night falls, and the ...

38:41.657 --> 38:44.060
out, drag your ass ...

38:44.105 --> 38:47.105
and makes the whole damn
forest knows it's there.

38:47.225 --> 38:48.953
Now you can not hear ...

38:48.996 --> 38:51.788
But inside, crying ..

38:51.908 --> 38:55.463
Because I damn lone wolf.

38:56.492 --> 38:58.255
Alone and free.

38:58.823 --> 39:01.168
- You understand?
- Balls.

39:01.288 --> 39:02.262
Thank you.

39:06.141 --> 39:07.098
Yes?

39:07.602 --> 39:08.869
Well, look.

39:09.753 --> 39:11.179
- Grace?
- Yes.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.827
What the ...?

39:30.039 --> 39:30.839
What?

39:32.679 --> 39:34.700
Is this place for real?

39:35.026 --> 39:36.810
I need a change right?

39:37.983 --> 39:39.357
Fuck you both.

39:39.407 --> 39:41.227
You could eat before doing this?

39:42.737 --> 39:44.579
This place is great.

39:53.738 --> 39:54.716
Hey.

39:55.367 --> 39:56.590
Peter Rothschild.

39:56.710 --> 39:57.675
Hey.

39:57.734 --> 39:59.719
Do not worry, I will only use the phone.

39:59.839 --> 40:01.099
What is your problem?

40:06.818 --> 40:08.552
Does your girlfriend know what happens?

40:08.667 --> 40:10.932
No do not worry
through the. He knows nothing.

40:10.989 --> 40:12.514
How do you know all that?

40:12.565 --> 40:13.982
They are my friends.

40:14.102 --> 40:16.989
I do not like a therapist
shit, sit ...

40:17.039 --> 40:18.507
tell me shit.

40:18.557 --> 40:20.140
They know they do not live with this woman.

40:20.260 --> 40:21.561
Is that why you're scared?

40:21.819 --> 40:23.777
I mean, you're betrayed.

40:23.897 --> 40:25.043
It's all about money.

40:25.295 --> 40:26.771
They understand that.

40:27.253 --> 40:30.734
They will betray one
others for a little money.

40:30.854 --> 40:33.409
And the time
they were in this ...

40:33.466 --> 40:35.841
I was far away,
I had a bloody accident.

40:37.898 --> 40:40.491
You say your friends
Do they work?

40:40.493 --> 40:41.285
Yes.

40:41.305 --> 40:42.373
But the problem is ...

40:42.493 --> 40:45.174
Nobody knows how the boy Manfreddi.

40:50.555 --> 40:51.663
You know what I want?

40:51.872 --> 40:53.325
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

40:53.373 --> 40:55.179
It looks like the waitress.

40:55.299 --> 40:57.222
What do you think of Anthony?

40:58.653 --> 41:00.297
I love breakfast for dinner.

41:00.988 --> 41:02.506
Breakfast may not be at the dinner.

41:02.556 --> 41:06.280
I only ate eggs
scrambled eggs and pancakes ...

41:06.400 --> 41:08.862
I ate sausages and juice
orange, what do you call it?

41:10.602 --> 41:11.589
Breakfast.

41:11.709 --> 41:13.488
- Yes that's right.
- No no.

41:13.608 --> 41:17.008
Eat breakfast food for dinner.

41:17.037 --> 41:18.562
You know, breakfast, lunch and dinner.

41:18.682 --> 41:21.800
It has nothing to do with
the food is on the hour.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.455
Everyone knows that.

41:23.575 --> 41:26.664
It's all about the
eat the food.

41:26.784 --> 41:29.048
For breakfast at the diner

41:29.168 --> 41:32.237
People are like waves in the ocean.

41:32.357 --> 41:34.457
They do the same every day.

41:34.577 --> 41:35.863
Because it is what is assumed.

41:35.983 --> 41:38.617
- Surfing right? how ...
- Sea waves ..

41:38.737 --> 41:40.305
Crashing on the beach every day.

41:40.307 --> 41:42.675
I do not care about the waves, not
I'm going to crash on the beach.

41:42.704 --> 41:45.411
I will not be one of those waves,
I will do today.

41:45.456 --> 41:48.419
I'm going to beat the system, I will
breakfast at night.

41:48.455 --> 41:50.252
You can have breakfast ...

41:50.297 --> 41:52.303
Are not you tired of it?

41:52.447 --> 41:53.751
Tired of what?

41:53.777 --> 41:55.479
All this talk.

41:55.515 --> 41:56.828
No.

41:57.134 --> 41:59.966
Have you ever stopped to think about
what we do for a living?

42:01.610 --> 42:04.931
I did some work for a few
weeks, it was a regular job.

42:04.958 --> 42:08.096
The husband and wife separated.

42:10.402 --> 42:14.826
And I was in the room
where his wife slept.

42:18.867 --> 42:21.583
I do not know why, but I ...

42:22.487 --> 42:24.466
I did not say anything.

42:25.212 --> 42:27.451
For her dead.

42:29.760 --> 42:33.663
<i>And in those few seconds, I heard something.</i>

43:12.336 --> 43:14.737
<i>I told him that I was an angel.</i>

43:16.490 --> 43:18.774
<i>Only an angel.</i>

43:24.893 --> 43:27.086
Did you get the job done?

43:30.966 --> 43:33.845
I woke up the woman, and
I told him why I was there.

43:34.061 --> 43:37.468
If you paid to kill
woman, murder of his wife.

43:37.504 --> 43:38.889
I know.

43:38.952 --> 43:40.832
What if she goes to
law enforcement? What then?

43:40.860 --> 43:42.486
I made it.

43:44.179 --> 43:45.312
What?

44:02.053 --> 44:04.143
I killed the man.

44:09.161 --> 44:12.359
That's what I'm
talk, breakfast and dinner.

45:35.657 --> 45:37.510
How you doing, Mark?

45:38.179 --> 45:39.649
Who the fuck you?

45:40.093 --> 45:41.989
Outside my house, or
I'm calling the police!

45:42.035 --> 45:44.070
How will you do that?

45:45.662 --> 45:47.314
I need some information.

45:47.340 --> 45:48.310
Which information?

45:48.346 --> 45:52.798
A mine employee, Clarence
Foster had slain the other day.

45:52.894 --> 45:55.765
stung dozen
Sometimes it was very cruel.

45:56.565 --> 45:59.680
I think you have something to do with it.

46:01.897 --> 46:05.141
Yes? I think I'm right.

46:06.385 --> 46:09.039
Tell me the truth.

46:09.665 --> 46:11.648
Where's the package?

46:11.883 --> 46:13.341
I saw nothing.

46:13.376 --> 46:16.324
Well, I'll ask again.

46:16.444 --> 46:18.542
Where's the package?

46:18.586 --> 46:21.247
Package? I swear I do not know.

46:21.367 --> 46:24.205
Sal to talk.

46:24.253 --> 46:27.051
I swear I know nothing about the package.

46:27.069 --> 46:29.396
Do not fuck with me.

46:29.413 --> 46:32.292
I'm not fucking with you. I do not know anything.

46:32.319 --> 46:34.551
- Why did you kill him?
- Because you killed my brother.

46:34.568 --> 46:36.481
I paid to see him die.

46:36.507 --> 46:38.000
But I killed him, I'm sorry.

46:38.043 --> 46:39.887
Did you kill yourself?

46:39.913 --> 46:43.084
No, there was another guy.

46:43.204 --> 46:45.045
- Who?
- Do not tell me his name.

46:45.046 --> 46:46.346
What does?

46:46.480 --> 46:48.211
He said he would murder me.

46:54.920 --> 46:57.450
I think we can do
better than this.

46:57.485 --> 47:00.155
I will speak, either ..

47:00.275 --> 47:02.668
He's tall, 6'2 "and 6'3".

47:02.678 --> 47:04.324
Italian?

47:04.444 --> 47:06.916
I do not know, maybe. Italian.

47:06.943 --> 47:08.368
I think I know who's talking.

47:08.412 --> 47:10.322
This one is cooperation.

47:10.442 --> 47:13.706
And now I will ask a question,
and think carefully.

47:13.966 --> 47:16.558
Do you have a chance to talk
Clarence before I murder him?

47:16.584 --> 47:17.648
No.

47:17.674 --> 47:20.857
Did he have anything with him?
Envelopes, photos, anything?

47:20.892 --> 47:22.306
I did not see anything.

47:22.350 --> 47:24.133
What about the guy who helped you?

47:24.159 --> 47:26.707
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

47:29.865 --> 47:32.871
Wait, wait, wait, wait ...

47:33.497 --> 47:36.637
He had a briefcase. It took a number of the case.

47:39.479 --> 47:43.142
Do you know? If it were not for this
dick, you'd be home now.

47:43.175 --> 47:45.904
Watch TV
and counting my money.

47:46.939 --> 47:50.505
But I have to walk
in the city ...

48:06.223 --> 48:10.189
looking for that package.

48:28.073 --> 48:29.682
Shit.

48:57.973 --> 48:59.068
What are you doing?

48:59.180 --> 49:01.363
- Thinking.
- About what?

49:03.189 --> 49:05.781
Does this man? You do your
Carlo Manfreddi son?

49:06.033 --> 49:08.312
It's a shit, Roman, come on, come on.

49:08.347 --> 49:10.330
I can not do it. It's not him.

49:10.373 --> 49:13.092
Can you not? What is wrong?
Are you in some kind of revelation?

49:13.118 --> 49:15.124
I'm just a little tired
not do this anymore.

49:15.167 --> 49:17.220
Fuck.

49:17.681 --> 49:18.826
Do not, Anthony!

49:18.861 --> 49:20.444
- Are you going to murder me?
- Do not.

49:20.470 --> 49:22.940
- Are you going to murder me?
- Do not do it!

49:23.183 --> 49:25.459
Give me a little time to think.

49:25.579 --> 49:27.380
I can not believe it.

49:27.650 --> 49:31.527
I can not believe I need
drink. Give me a whiskey.

49:31.787 --> 49:33.840
Hurry, come on!

49:34.615 --> 49:37.384
Give to him.

49:39.290 --> 49:40.873
What the fuck?

49:42.998 --> 49:44.945
I do not know, man.

49:46.215 --> 49:48.563
There must be something more than this.

49:51.303 --> 49:54.121
We have a lot of
money, you and me ..

49:54.504 --> 49:58.027
We do not have problems
and if so, but ...

49:58.147 --> 49:59.991
It's a good job.

50:00.053 --> 50:01.627
Grace is right.

50:02.279 --> 50:05.577
We murder people without thinking about anything.

50:05.619 --> 50:07.498
That's our job.

50:07.525 --> 50:11.996
What the fuck did he do that?
He took the money and killed her husband.

50:12.318 --> 50:14.101
We are hunters, partner.

50:14.405 --> 50:15.401
at the top
the food chain.

50:15.502 --> 50:17.798
Killing should be slain, that's all.

50:17.859 --> 50:21.051
We do not know whether these
people deserve to die.

50:21.260 --> 50:26.093
It must end and
end have consequences.

50:26.162 --> 50:28.630
... That is karma.

50:28.673 --> 50:30.752
This shit we got back.

50:30.769 --> 50:32.483
And I ...

50:33.431 --> 50:35.828
I want to make
take care of myself.

50:35.862 --> 50:39.358
I need to redeem myself and you.

50:40.116 --> 50:41.837
- You never see the moon?
- What?

50:41.881 --> 50:43.708
It's like shit
you said about Wolf.

50:43.741 --> 50:46.969
That is to see the moon, see how ...

50:47.089 --> 50:49.488
the texture, the way it seems ...

50:49.548 --> 50:52.072
Sometimes I wish
get on my table ...

50:52.192 --> 50:54.877
and the sea at night ...

50:54.929 --> 50:56.634
sit there.

50:56.703 --> 50:59.295
See the moon and the stars.

50:59.321 --> 51:02.820
Nobody, just me and the fish.

51:03.247 --> 51:06.134
Mammals, there is also
mammals, whales ...

51:06.169 --> 51:08.195
Are you a damn Jaques
Cousteau or something?

51:08.221 --> 51:10.117
Well, well, what's your point?

51:10.135 --> 51:12.805
It does not matter if you shoot it, dammit.

51:12.857 --> 51:13.849
No offense.

51:13.865 --> 51:15.705
I care about.

51:15.941 --> 51:18.697
And I want this damn dead.

51:18.897 --> 51:20.889
Do you have family?

51:21.477 --> 51:23.844
- Come on, mate ...
- Do not do that.

51:23.964 --> 51:27.375
You talk about how the universe
It has all that beauty ...

51:27.383 --> 51:29.572
But what we are
doing is ugly, man.

51:29.607 --> 51:33.338
And we do not live in the ocean
Moon or pussy.

51:33.346 --> 51:37.664
We live here, and everything
we do business.

51:39.239 --> 51:42.681
All this is because your girlfriend cheated on you?

51:42.725 --> 51:44.525
No partner, no.

51:44.560 --> 51:47.538
You go, someone who trusted you
who do not trust you.

51:47.556 --> 51:50.391
You made the decision
wrong, great cosota.

51:50.452 --> 51:52.252
It happens to people every day.

51:52.279 --> 51:54.856
You have to deal with that and beyond.

51:54.976 --> 51:56.979
I move on, man.

51:57.423 --> 52:00.910
That's my point, right
you care about this?

52:01.030 --> 52:02.946
How we live our lives?

52:03.198 --> 52:05.572
What do you do to innocent people?

52:05.624 --> 52:07.120
I have my dilemma.

52:07.155 --> 52:10.103
I know, I have to go looking for peace.

52:10.363 --> 52:13.199
They are not innocent people
victims, Roman.

52:27.363 --> 52:29.742
Do what you want with her.

52:31.107 --> 52:33.178
It's your problem.

52:36.366 --> 52:38.349
It's your problem.

52:46.342 --> 52:48.217
You are about to disappear.

52:48.337 --> 52:52.436
In Mexico, Europe ... I do not care.

52:53.557 --> 52:56.445
No return to Los Angeles
again, you know?

52:56.923 --> 52:58.741
Yes.

53:22.313 --> 53:25.009
- What, Los?
- What?

53:26.574 --> 53:28.454
We follow anyone.

53:28.541 --> 53:32.734
Anthony Rizzo, Johnny
It has an address ...

53:32.925 --> 53:34.860
I want to take you.

53:35.207 --> 53:37.895
Want to put me in this madness?

53:38.015 --> 53:39.247
I will be my own.

53:39.273 --> 53:41.491
Well, it does.

53:41.525 --> 53:42.943
Alive or dead?

53:42.968 --> 53:45.321
- I want him alive.
- A dead cert.

53:45.441 --> 53:47.488
- I wear tonight?
- Yes.

53:47.513 --> 53:49.340
Will you give me a discount?

53:50.715 --> 53:54.183
Yes, take it to my house,
and I will give you a bonus.

53:54.227 --> 53:56.966
- I'll be there.
- Good.

53:57.948 --> 54:00.305
Hey, what about you?

54:00.766 --> 54:03.637
Please do not risk me
ass in the suicide mission.

54:03.654 --> 54:06.651
- I know you're my boss, but ..
- Do not be angry.

54:06.695 --> 54:08.530
I knew he would do
This shit himself.

54:08.617 --> 54:14.256
I'm just saying, but the following
After the first tell me about your plans.

54:14.508 --> 54:16.195
I think we're a team.

54:16.230 --> 54:19.918
No, you do not work for me a team.

54:20.466 --> 54:22.387
You're an employee.

54:54.309 --> 54:56.745
The bastard is passed
the back seat of my car.

54:56.762 --> 54:57.666
What about the pictures?

54:57.675 --> 55:01.815
<i>I do not know, please ask when
then take a few hours.</i>

55:01.877 --> 55:04.465
What you registered?

55:04.509 --> 55:06.926
<i>I'm not a fan, I got your gun.</i>

55:06.978 --> 55:09.708
Carlos is a murderer.
He carries more than a weapon.

55:09.751 --> 55:12.108
<i>Damn ... Damn ...</i>

55:12.335 --> 55:14.718
Want? Want?

56:28.287 --> 56:30.121
The dead.

56:30.165 --> 56:33.461
- I do not know.
- Yeah, I know, I heard on the phone.

56:33.490 --> 56:36.080
He said he was on his way home.

56:36.099 --> 56:38.578
What I'm saying is
I was with Anthony.

56:38.595 --> 56:42.279
He did not answer, and it is not
here. Reached a conclusion.

56:42.627 --> 56:44.636
That means nothing.

56:48.746 --> 56:52.067
- I bet Rizzo.
- Shut up!

57:17.350 --> 57:19.786
My mother worked in Las Vegas.

57:20.090 --> 57:23.674
And I always used to hang.

57:23.794 --> 57:28.188
In the casino,
day hovering ...

57:28.249 --> 57:30.090
And I heard voices.

57:30.107 --> 57:34.778
So I approached slowly,
and I'm standing in a small room ...

57:34.830 --> 57:37.857
And there's a big guy
He sits in a chair.

57:37.892 --> 57:41.498
She was crying and sweating.

57:41.516 --> 57:45.683
Begged for his life, then,
Suddenly I heard a pop.

57:45.744 --> 57:48.762
And the man fell dead.

57:49.205 --> 57:50.797
And another ...

57:51.022 --> 57:53.594
He stepped out of the shadows.

57:53.941 --> 57:56.517
This killer ...

57:58.357 --> 58:01.697
He turned around.

58:02.393 --> 58:06.137
Look as if nothing had happened.

58:08.615 --> 58:12.027
I remember thinking ...

58:13.757 --> 58:16.567
That's power.

58:18.698 --> 58:21.490
I've been looking for my whole life.

58:23.229 --> 58:25.065
Did you found it?

58:25.485 --> 58:27.861
There Grace.

58:29.200 --> 58:31.279
It is an illusion.

58:31.487 --> 58:33.844
So nothing will stop you?

58:33.860 --> 58:36.511
I've been thinking about this.

58:36.553 --> 58:39.059
I've wasted enough time.

58:39.355 --> 58:44.059
I want a change,
I want a wife, children.

58:44.155 --> 58:46.624
I know I can not fix what I did ...

58:46.650 --> 58:49.408
But I can teach my children
to do what is right.

58:49.451 --> 58:52.253
- What do you mean?
- You know that.

58:53.288 --> 58:55.471
I can not read minds, Roman.

58:55.591 --> 58:57.393
I am ready ..

58:57.724 --> 58:59.516
To get out.

59:07.787 --> 59:09.439
Hey?

59:11.879 --> 59:13.922
Is everything alright?

59:16.298 --> 59:18.887
Well, where are you?

59:19.888 --> 59:21.514
Agreed.

59:25.929 --> 59:28.434
- I have to go.
- What? Come on.

59:28.547 --> 59:32.071
Look, Roman, sorry but I have to go.

59:32.271 --> 59:33.498
I got to help a friend.

59:33.524 --> 59:36.391
Grace, you've tried to do
In my view, open all the time.

59:36.426 --> 59:38.957
And now I have to go?

59:38.983 --> 59:40.379
Sorry.

59:40.423 --> 59:42.206
I think about what you said.

59:42.233 --> 59:44.833
Grace, tell me what the hell is going on.

59:44.858 --> 59:46.723
I got to help a friend.

59:46.775 --> 59:48.106
Grace.

59:48.211 --> 59:49.663
Grace.

59:50.246 --> 59:51.855
I need you.

59:53.981 --> 59:55.929
Finally a revelation.

59:55.973 --> 59:58.704
Okay, go, go to hell.

59:58.791 --> 01:00:00.143
You know what? No.

01:00:00.178 --> 01:00:02.848
So it was that Wendy
I put the horns.

01:00:02.874 --> 01:00:04.718
You're a control freak.

01:00:04.838 --> 01:00:07.027
Do you need me, Roman?

01:00:09.975 --> 01:00:13.258
Sorry, but I'm
a little upset about it.

01:00:21.844 --> 01:00:23.601
No no.

01:00:23.644 --> 01:00:25.557
Grace.

01:00:25.992 --> 01:00:27.996
What is this?

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.306
I'm okay, Grace.

01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:35.411
You're not well, look.

01:00:36.446 --> 01:00:38.212
Fuck you!

01:00:38.603 --> 01:00:40.109
Give me the needle, Grace.

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:41.318
No.

01:00:41.352 --> 01:00:45.197
Mercy, give me the needle! Give it to me, Grace!

01:00:48.769 --> 01:00:50.700
Please, come on.

01:00:58.164 --> 01:01:01.119
Grace, I have seen God.

01:01:02.667 --> 01:01:05.241
I saw the Lord and kissed him.

01:01:07.819 --> 01:01:09.888
Amidst all this shit.

01:01:10.358 --> 01:01:11.671
And he disappeared.

01:01:11.697 --> 01:01:14.237
You've never God saw Anthony.

01:01:14.507 --> 01:01:17.281
Pass by heroin.

01:01:17.586 --> 01:01:20.204
You have not seen God.

01:01:22.723 --> 01:01:24.348
No.

01:01:25.376 --> 01:01:29.575
It was really, Grace. I assure you that I saw.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:35.440
I feel the infinite love,
I never felt before.

01:01:38.667 --> 01:01:41.068
I have to kiss him again.

01:01:43.503 --> 01:01:45.069
Once.
939
01:01:45.365 -->01:01:48.597
You chase something that is not real.

01:01:49.737 --> 01:01:51.841
It's just an illusion.

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:57.281
Can you see it?

01:01:57.401 --> 01:01:59.923
Nothing more than
it can be continued.

01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:08.693
Is everything alright?

01:04:16.606 --> 01:04:19.215
I will not do again, Anthony.

01:04:37.362 --> 01:04:38.867
Want?

01:04:39.293 --> 01:04:40.650
Huh?

01:04:41.722 --> 01:04:46.054
Lauren, yes, welcome
again, sweetheart.

01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:48.339
You can take a taxi?

01:04:50.496 --> 01:04:51.910
The dog?

01:04:53.702 --> 01:04:57.160
I can not be your dog
Tonight, I'm busy.

01:04:58.343 --> 01:05:00.205
I said you take a taxi.

01:05:04.161 --> 01:05:06.100
What if we tell
Woody bring Rizzo?

01:05:06.126 --> 01:05:08.193
Will not.

01:05:08.958 --> 01:05:11.506
I'm running out of options.

01:05:11.626 --> 01:05:14.818
You can think of something else
other than mount an ambush.

01:05:15.165 --> 01:05:17.566
There is a girl, Grace.

01:05:17.686 --> 01:05:20.393
Rizzo knows, maybe I can help.

01:05:20.436 --> 01:05:21.869
Why do we help?

01:05:21.904 --> 01:05:24.878
She's a woman, it's all about money.

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:27.114
Well, for sure.

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:30.471
I will agree with that talk
Woody pollajo again.

01:05:34.462 --> 01:05:35.932
Hey?

01:05:37.175 --> 01:05:39.097
You betrayed me, Woody.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.119
Rizzo.

01:05:41.797 --> 01:05:43.197
Can I call you back?

01:05:43.232 --> 01:05:45.197
No ...

01:05:45.789 --> 01:05:49.271
The nature of the thought Valle
those pictures that saved his life.

01:05:50.557 --> 01:05:52.715
What will save yours ...?

01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:54.184
Partner?

01:06:00.554 --> 01:06:04.737
You said you were discreet.

01:06:07.103 --> 01:06:09.069
This is half of mine.

01:06:09.852 --> 01:06:13.679
It was certainly enough
for a holiday.

01:06:14.802 --> 01:06:16.506
Finish him.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.507
Or we're both dead.

01:06:23.152 --> 01:06:26.658
It is open, I'm in the kitchen.

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:30.790
What, honey?

01:06:30.834 --> 01:06:32.668
- Sorry.
- No, that's fine.

01:06:32.694 --> 01:06:37.033
- Sorry ..
- Okay, I thought you could not mourn.

01:06:37.608 --> 01:06:39.469
I think I'm in love.

01:06:40.686 --> 01:06:41.841
What?

01:06:42.258 --> 01:06:43.867
No ...

01:06:44.294 --> 01:06:46.164
I know I'm in love.

01:06:46.284 --> 01:06:49.535
I do not know what to say.

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.047
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:06:51.074 --> 01:06:52.039
Who?

01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:53.335
You do not want to know.

01:06:53.371 --> 01:06:54.531
Sorry to hear that.

01:06:54.558 --> 01:06:57.679
You know me, if I
tomcat I go to work.

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:59.027
What's the problem?

01:06:59.046 --> 01:07:01.755
Not a good time.

01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:03.443
Only what?

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:10.542
Well well ...

01:07:10.662 --> 01:07:14.670
- Do you know my boss, Jason Donatelli?
- Yes.

01:07:15.305 --> 01:07:17.053
You need something.

01:07:19.607 --> 01:07:21.164
Anthony has.

01:07:21.284 --> 01:07:23.704
He tried to catch Anthony last night.

01:07:23.738 --> 01:07:26.378
And he escaped and killed a worker.

01:07:26.406 --> 01:07:27.928
Why did not you tell me before?

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:30.865
Jason, you pay good money for.

01:07:30.901 --> 01:07:32.909
Just say a price.

01:07:33.194 --> 01:07:34.065
What do you want?

01:07:34.065 --> 01:07:36.534
The man took the package
Carlo Manfreddi.

01:07:36.569 --> 01:07:37.744
Is the Mafia don?

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.896
No, his son Carlo Jr.

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.176
Photos of her illegitimate child.

01:07:42.201 --> 01:07:44.812
He is willing to spend big
money to murder the man.

01:07:44.873 --> 01:07:48.856
And he convinced Jason Jr.
give to spread the photos.

01:07:49.317 --> 01:07:50.674
Grace.

01:07:51.091 --> 01:07:52.867
He's got those pictures.

01:07:52.954 --> 01:07:54.677
Anthony does.

01:07:56.103 --> 01:07:59.324
Anthony would want to kill him and
get Manfreddi money.

01:07:59.357 --> 01:08:01.055
Will you help me, Grace?

01:08:01.159 --> 01:08:02.551
Please.

01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:06.268
250 grand.

01:08:06.303 --> 01:08:09.016
No problem. Okay.

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:10.695
Good.

01:08:25.912 --> 01:08:29.522
Roman, we have a problem.

01:08:29.917 --> 01:08:31.598
I knew you'd come back.

01:08:31.658 --> 01:08:33.477
I need your help, Roman needed.
We have a problem.

01:08:33.502 --> 01:08:35.078
Yes of course.

01:08:35.772 --> 01:08:37.344
You know what? I would not have gone.

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:38.856
What? What?

01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:41.536
Someone Anthony murder last night tried.

01:08:41.828 --> 01:08:43.523
Woody betrayed him.

01:08:43.888 --> 01:08:46.394
You went where you were last night?

01:08:46.435 --> 01:08:50.094
I opened my heart and
you run after an addict?

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:52.294
I know all about that shit.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:54.868
I'm engaged
Woody for that addict?

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.249
Your boyfriend can not ignore 24
hours without a needle in your arm?

01:08:58.292 --> 01:09:01.415
- Are you in love with him?
- You want to hear, right?

01:09:09.166 --> 01:09:10.437
What?

01:09:10.792 --> 01:09:14.707
Anthony has pictures of a
Manfreddi son Carlo.

01:09:14.827 --> 01:09:15.959
What?

01:09:16.078 --> 01:09:19.438
It has all the photos that are supposed
They should reach the hands of Jason Donatelli.

01:09:19.517 --> 01:09:21.523
No, no, Grace, what the hell are you talking about?

01:09:21.549 --> 01:09:24.089
We are all busy,
there is no positive identity.

01:09:24.113 --> 01:09:26.096
Anthony has a positive identity.

01:09:26.216 --> 01:09:28.442
And when the man did not show up
Donatelli photo with ...

01:09:28.459 --> 01:09:31.581
He was where he and Woody Woody
He mentioned the name of Anthony.

01:09:32.546 --> 01:09:36.250
Roman, Woody knows everything
the work we do.

01:09:36.442 --> 01:09:38.077
What can we do?

01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:41.103
- Where's Anthony?
- Why?

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.365
Novel, why?

01:09:51.077 --> 01:09:53.290
Roman, where you going?

01:10:10.742 --> 01:10:13.334
It is extremely partner.

01:10:14.979 --> 01:10:16.771
I love it.

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:19.902
Just like in the old days.

01:10:19.963 --> 01:10:21.316
Why did you, Woody?

01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:23.177
It was just business.

01:10:23.221 --> 01:10:25.395
- What about loyalty?
- Yes.

01:10:25.935 --> 01:10:28.441
Loyalty to my business.

01:10:28.737 --> 01:10:31.416
Everything is about information,
just business.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:34.124
She made me a better offer.

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.499
So just betrayed Anthony?

01:10:38.421 --> 01:10:41.815
That was about all
Change what?

01:10:41.867 --> 01:10:44.293
All this is just stupid. You know that.

01:10:44.763 --> 01:10:47.941
Why suddenly the hell do you care?

01:10:48.001 --> 01:10:49.523
I trusted you.

01:10:51.471 --> 01:10:53.341
All we trusted.

01:10:56.977 --> 01:10:58.647
Who's next?

01:10:59.151 --> 01:11:02.804
He just wanted to talk,
that's what he told me.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.812
They did not talk much right?

01:11:08.987 --> 01:11:11.595
- What should I do, Woody?
- Help us.

01:11:13.179 --> 01:11:16.010
Please kill Anthony.

01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:20.815
Let a
amount of money, you and me.

01:11:20.842 --> 01:11:22.554
We can divide.

01:11:22.841 --> 01:11:24.711
If you murder him.

01:11:25.155 --> 01:11:26.720
That's all.

01:11:32.112 --> 01:11:34.191
When I was growing ...

01:11:35.349 --> 01:11:38.054
I remember reading something ...

01:11:38.846 --> 01:11:41.046
in the bathroom wall of my uncle.

01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:48.421
He said there are two things to think about.

01:11:48.621 --> 01:11:50.403
Healthy or sick.

01:11:50.457 --> 01:11:53.439
If you are healthy, there is nothing to
worry, if you're sick ...

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:56.653
Only two things to think about.

01:11:59.045 --> 01:12:01.141
Life and death.

01:12:02.504 --> 01:12:05.244
If you live, there is
nothing wrong.

01:12:06.853 --> 01:12:08.180
If you die ...

01:12:08.224 --> 01:12:11.068
There are only two things in
to think in the sky ...

01:12:11.085 --> 01:12:12.754
or hell.

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:16.040
If you go to heaven ...

01:12:17.658 --> 01:12:19.762
there is nothing to worry about.

01:12:21.869 --> 01:12:24.069
If you're going to hell ...

01:12:25.792 --> 01:12:30.122
You'll be so busy that there is no
You have to make the time.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.406
A great day, tonight?

01:13:44.474 --> 01:13:45.779
Undoubtedly.

01:13:45.822 --> 01:13:47.919
Mercy, Anthony.

01:13:48.039 --> 01:13:50.247
He is Jason Donatelli.

01:13:51.456 --> 01:13:52.995
Hey.

01:13:54.867 --> 01:13:57.850
Jonathan, you
register, please?

01:13:59.042 --> 01:14:00.563
Of course.

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:04.315
Is this the Jonathan?

01:14:04.435 --> 01:14:05.734
Silence.

01:14:19.366 --> 01:14:20.949
They are clean.

01:14:23.016 --> 01:14:24.921
Got my stuff?

01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:27.252
I brought him here's the deal.

01:14:32.344 --> 01:14:36.637
Honey, you will not give a shit
until my pictures.

01:14:48.737 --> 01:14:51.148
And the winner is ...

01:14:58.062 --> 01:15:01.550
$ 250.000. Grace.

01:15:01.576 --> 01:15:03.388
Thanks, Jonathan.

01:15:03.406 --> 01:15:04.684
Fuck you, Grace.

01:15:04.728 --> 01:15:06.920
I leave you guys.

01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:20.209
Take the money and out.

01:15:20.329 --> 01:15:22.366
Whore cunt.

01:15:23.696 --> 01:15:27.644
You, my friend, have been
a stitch in my ass.

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:31.983
What assures me that no
they killed this man?

01:15:32.053 --> 01:15:33.575
Maybe I did.

01:15:33.619 --> 01:15:35.836
It was a poor response.

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:39.223
Why do not you come to me?

01:15:39.343 --> 01:15:41.233
I lost a number of species by you.

01:15:41.267 --> 01:15:42.783
What's your offer?

01:15:42.818 --> 01:15:44.670
Your life.

01:15:46.297 --> 01:15:48.044
Make me an offer.

01:15:50.057 --> 01:15:52.198
What is the difference?

01:15:52.318 --> 01:15:54.207
You're going to kill me anyway.

01:15:54.764 --> 01:15:57.210
You have to trust me.

01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:08.128
Are you planning to do it or not?

01:16:08.248 --> 01:16:10.099
What are you doing then?

01:16:13.143 --> 01:16:15.505
Well well ..

01:16:15.523 --> 01:16:17.323
Good.

01:16:17.358 --> 01:16:19.891
That was a terrible shot, man.

01:16:19.935 --> 01:16:21.918
I talk about curses Willy Smith, partner.

01:16:21.935 --> 01:16:23.640
That was hell, man.

01:16:23.692 --> 01:16:25.614
Yes. And you alone.

01:16:25.646 --> 01:16:27.159
What about the money?

01:16:27.263 --> 01:16:28.490
flew money.

01:16:28.523 --> 01:16:30.567
It is assumed that you had
to kill him, that was the deal.

01:16:30.594 --> 01:16:33.650
Instead keep them
stiff as a mariconsón.

01:16:33.998 --> 01:16:36.990
Come on, I'm not a killer.

01:16:37.371 --> 01:16:39.441
I'm Johnny Solo, do not.

01:16:39.483 --> 01:16:40.945
You need to get rid of the body.

01:16:41.266 --> 01:16:43.606
What I see as the messengers?

01:16:44.598 --> 01:16:46.227
Shit.

01:17:13.136 --> 01:17:15.605
- Yes?
- Is Burke, okay?

01:17:15.701 --> 01:17:18.520
Yes, I did.

01:17:48.093 --> 01:17:49.528
You're dead!

01:17:49.555 --> 01:17:51.398
You told me I had to two.

01:17:51.441 --> 01:17:53.831
Do you hear me? You're dead!

01:17:56.597 --> 01:17:58.762
Who are you?

01:18:12.690 --> 01:18:15.527
Hey, it's Anthony. Fucked up, man.

01:18:15.571 --> 01:18:18.154
Well just do what
right and everything will be fine.

01:18:18.206 --> 01:18:20.240
I'll give you a chance, man.

01:18:20.467 --> 01:18:21.963
Take it.

01:18:22.015 --> 01:18:23.084
Is there a problem?

01:18:23.103 --> 01:18:24.241
I need money.

01:18:24.276 --> 01:18:25.720
It would give a deposit.

01:18:25.747 --> 01:18:27.247
I have it all now.

01:18:27.318 --> 01:18:31.422
Ironically, I only see a
documentary about the Mafia.

01:18:31.944 --> 01:18:33.978
They speak of a person
on the second floor.

01:18:34.022 --> 01:18:35.691
What do you mean?

01:18:35.718 --> 01:18:38.588
Those people always throws his victims
the upper floors or ceilings.

01:18:38.666 --> 01:18:41.256
I had to call shortly.

01:18:42.812 --> 01:18:44.996
They say it will take for the exposure.

01:18:45.309 --> 01:18:46.923
- Does that mean?
- Yes.

01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:48.759
How the fuck do you know?

01:18:48.793 --> 01:18:50.211
Forensics.

01:18:51.486 --> 01:18:55.079
Masha Peter. Am I
you Sam, please?

01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:57.253
It must first be approved.

01:18:57.287 --> 01:18:58.966
They may know what is
flashes before his death.

01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:01.723
It is trash TV. I
I do not want to participate.

01:19:01.843 --> 01:19:05.015
And while you fall
knows in which direction your lands.

01:19:05.059 --> 01:19:07.851
First face, so that there are no surprises.

01:19:07.874 --> 01:19:10.022
I want to see who's going to murder me.

01:19:10.066 --> 01:19:11.979
It would be the floor.

01:19:12.501 --> 01:19:13.936
Yes.

01:19:17.314 --> 01:19:18.723
Thank you.

01:19:23.393 --> 01:19:26.002
- Yes?
- It's me.

01:19:26.402 --> 01:19:27.926
He will do it.

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:30.292
Well, stay there.

01:19:30.326 --> 01:19:32.484
I'll be there.

01:19:34.545 --> 01:19:37.482
Well, I'll see you there.

01:19:59.726 --> 01:20:01.179
Why did you do that?

01:20:01.205 --> 01:20:02.529
You have your story.

01:20:02.547 --> 01:20:03.981
And what about the pictures?

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:05.104
That was not part of the deal.

01:20:05.165 --> 01:20:06.930
I have those pictures, Johnny Solo.

01:20:06.948 --> 01:20:08.565
I must know who he is.

01:20:18.401 --> 01:20:19.905
Fuck.

01:20:21.463 --> 01:20:23.735
Damn, damn ...

01:20:24.092 --> 01:20:26.040
Hello, partners!

01:20:26.144 --> 01:20:28.089
Hey.

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:30.803
Well well.

01:20:37.846 --> 01:20:39.507
Do you know them all?

01:20:40.722 --> 01:20:42.260
Hello, mate.

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:44.027
Do you think we would
track your smell?

01:20:44.062 --> 01:20:47.086
Pete and I were just talking.

01:20:47.128 --> 01:20:50.642
Do you know? I was just
tell you this.

01:20:50.762 --> 01:20:54.958
And you know all this
It has nothing to do with you.

01:20:55.332 --> 01:20:57.741
It was just a joke, huh Pete?

01:20:57.861 --> 01:21:00.588
It told me everything I recorded.

01:21:00.623 --> 01:21:02.571
It's fascinating.

01:21:02.606 --> 01:21:04.780
Do you want it? You can hold.

01:21:04.971 --> 01:21:05.972
Please.

01:21:07.701 --> 01:21:09.666
Where are you going? Sit.

01:21:10.371 --> 01:21:11.676
Agreed.

01:21:12.554 --> 01:21:14.763
I urge all people of Mafreddi.

01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:17.059
His name was Burke.

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:18.826
He's waiting for me now.

01:21:18.913 --> 01:21:20.935
It has millions of dollars with him.

01:21:21.014 --> 01:21:22.587
Yes, we met Burke.

01:21:22.727 --> 01:21:24.266
We've brought the money.

01:21:24.345 --> 01:21:25.746
A bag full.

01:21:25.779 --> 01:21:27.789
We got a set, Johnny Solo.

01:21:27.859 --> 01:21:30.259
We can not allow that.

01:21:30.513 --> 01:21:31.729
Okay, look.

01:21:31.765 --> 01:21:34.684
If I get shot, neighbors heard.

01:21:34.702 --> 01:21:36.502
They call the police.

01:21:42.165 --> 01:21:43.113
I do not think so.

01:21:43.139 --> 01:21:44.914
Do not shoot, please.

01:21:44.948 --> 01:21:47.486
I can give you money here,
the same on my computer.

01:21:47.529 --> 01:21:50.294
I have an account, can I
Money transfer.

01:21:50.365 --> 01:21:52.069
He has an account in the Cayman Islands.

01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:53.034
What ...?

01:21:53.078 --> 01:21:55.086
What is ours?

01:21:55.696 --> 01:21:57.817
I know the password.

01:22:00.954 --> 01:22:04.113
- How much?
- I can give you 100 grand.

01:22:04.534 --> 01:22:07.086
More than 150.000 gave him.

01:22:08.877 --> 01:22:11.268
But you know nothing.

01:22:11.317 --> 01:22:13.720
We do not know, I've never seen us.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.313
And if we do not hear from you.

01:22:16.388 --> 01:22:18.506
We will find you.

01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:21.034
And we'll murder you, understand?

01:22:21.108 --> 01:22:24.477
I promise, I will not talk.

01:22:25.233 --> 01:22:26.917
Wait a second.

01:22:28.141 --> 01:22:31.412
I did, and ready.

01:22:31.733 --> 01:22:34.803
Here it is, see.

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:38.555
The confirmation number,
Do you see? It is there.

01:22:38.617 --> 01:22:40.413
- Looks good.
- Good.

01:22:40.451 --> 01:22:42.849
- Thank you.
- No no.

01:22:43.407 --> 01:22:45.301
Who stays here.

01:22:45.401 --> 01:22:47.370
Oh yeah.

01:22:48.852 --> 01:22:50.587
No problem.

01:22:54.117 --> 01:22:58.224
- Have a good life.
- Thank you, thank you very much.

01:23:02.448 --> 01:23:07.575
There are $ 250.000 in that
Laptop, is it enough for you?

01:23:08.556 --> 01:23:11.323
Oh, my God, yes.

01:23:11.443 --> 01:23:15.168
I do not know what to say.

01:23:15.618 --> 01:23:18.658
Thank you.

01:23:25.595 --> 01:23:27.425
We trusted you, Solo.

01:23:27.643 --> 01:23:29.510
- You're greedy.
- Yes.

01:23:29.544 --> 01:23:31.064
We can talk well.

01:23:31.081 --> 01:23:34.066
It is not yet too late
we can work together.

01:23:34.651 --> 01:23:36.658
I have a drink and we ...

01:23:36.710 --> 01:23:38.342
Do you know? we ...

01:23:39.093 --> 01:23:41.693
Back! Back! Hands up!

01:23:41.813 --> 01:23:44.141
- Just what are you doing?
- Shut up.

01:23:44.175 --> 01:23:47.178
I'm going to shoot,
I swear. I'm crazy.

01:23:47.239 --> 01:23:48.827
I'm crazy.

01:23:49.071 --> 01:23:50.850
Weapons and keys, slowly.

01:23:50.911 --> 01:23:53.417
Solo, you have a plan?

01:23:54.525 --> 01:23:58.765
Others do not trust, make sure
the money is in the car Grace.

01:23:58.835 --> 01:24:01.208
Yes, I'm Johnny Solo, bitch.

01:24:01.226 --> 01:24:04.001
What are you doing? Let her go.

01:24:05.066 --> 01:24:06.218
Let her go.

01:24:06.235 --> 01:24:07.335
Fuck.

01:24:21.101 --> 01:24:23.108
That good shot.

01:24:23.169 --> 01:24:26.853
That's the shit
the one I'm talking about.

01:24:26.973 --> 01:24:29.017
That is, does the Karma.

01:24:29.036 --> 01:24:31.523
And he blew the ass to this motherfucker.

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.960
Come on, if only karma
He blew the ass ...

01:24:34.003 --> 01:24:35.958
We will all fuck them.

01:24:35.976 --> 01:24:40.532
No, because I began
the redemption process.

01:24:40.558 --> 01:24:42.164
Is there a process of redemption?

01:24:42.216 --> 01:24:44.309
Of course, the way here ...

01:24:44.344 --> 01:24:47.032
I made a promise to God ...

01:24:47.067 --> 01:24:49.040
That would change.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:52.469
I wrote on a
paper as a contract.

01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:56.627
And then I thought I would
breach of contract

01:24:56.747 --> 01:24:59.960
Only he died, now tell me that shit.

01:25:00.031 --> 01:25:01.427
Come explícamela.

01:25:01.461 --> 01:25:04.795
You tell me all
people in the world ...

01:25:04.915 --> 01:25:07.132
all these bad shit happens?

01:25:07.252 --> 01:25:08.922
You think ...?

01:25:09.043 --> 01:25:11.982
God took the time to look
down now ...

01:25:12.008 --> 01:25:14.814
He said:"I leave
someone boring

01:25:14.815 --> 01:25:17.620
Johnny Solo, Roman
No need to do that. "

01:25:17.653 --> 01:25:19.215
Want to believe that?

01:25:19.241 --> 01:25:21.013
All I'm saying is ...

01:25:21.056 --> 01:25:24.102
that if I had not just caught
Mercy, and he was not here ...

01:25:24.154 --> 01:25:25.851
we did not have this conversation.

01:25:25.903 --> 01:25:28.731
Yes, you're right, we did not
This talk, but ...

01:25:29.088 --> 01:25:30.650
If all this does not happen ..

01:25:30.684 --> 01:25:34.298
Johnny just have to die,
we will still kill him.

01:25:34.795 --> 01:25:37.539
Anyway, today she is deceased.

01:25:38.655 --> 01:25:40.244
This is not karma.

01:25:40.488 --> 01:25:41.938
It is the destination.

01:25:44.922 --> 01:25:46.415
Is she okay?

01:25:46.467 --> 01:25:48.701
Yeah, but we gotta get outta here.

01:25:50.013 --> 01:25:52.867
Would you like to keep?

01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:00.410
What are you going to do?

01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:04.398
I have money, passport ...

01:26:05.646 --> 01:26:08.159
Just ...

01:26:15.141 --> 01:26:17.125
Okay sweetheart.

01:26:17.317 --> 01:26:19.673
I hope you
what you need.

01:26:28.388 --> 01:26:30.805
Anthony Rizzo.

01:26:31.145 --> 01:26:32.480
Thank you.

01:26:32.690 --> 01:26:34.156
No problem, man.

01:26:34.296 --> 01:26:36.640
- Leave your side?
- Yes.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.938
Keep an eye on
we will use one day.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.645
Yeah, okay. Take care.
