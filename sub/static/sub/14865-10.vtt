WEBVTT

01:44.563 --> 01:46.224
Pull!

01:47.191 --> 01:48.931
Pull!

01:59.620 --> 02:01.861
He's gone. Put him over.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.665
Sir.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.262
Salve, Vorenus.

02:20.391 --> 02:22.803
— How are you?
— Good enough.

02:24.103 --> 02:26.594
— Water.
— Thank you.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.322
I was far away.

02:41.579 --> 02:43.661
All my life...

02:44.874 --> 02:47.160
I've been fearful of defeat.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.626
But now that it has come,

02:52.173 --> 02:55.415
it's not near as terrible as I'd expected.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.254
The sun sti|| shines.

03:02.558 --> 03:04.674
Water sti|| tastes good.

03:06.520 --> 03:11.355
Glory is all well and good, but...

03:13.027 --> 03:15.109
life is enough, ne?

03:18.866 --> 03:22.575
Glorious news! At Actium, in Greece,

03:22.703 --> 03:26.537
the navy of our imperator Octavian Caesar

03:26.665 --> 03:30.328
under the command
of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa

03:30.461 --> 03:33.043
has won a decisive victory

03:33.172 --> 03:34.912
over Queen Cleopatra

03:35.049 --> 03:37.756
and her slave Mark Antony.

03:37.885 --> 03:42.094
The Egyptian fleet
has been destroyed.

03:43.391 --> 03:48.306
Even now, Octavian Caesar
advances on Alexandria

03:48.437 --> 03:51.474
where the witch and her creature
take refuge.

03:53.025 --> 03:57.610
Apparently, Cleopatra took fright and fled
as soon as the battle started.

03:57.738 --> 04:02.107
And that cowardly villain Antony
jumped in a boat and chased after her.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.825
Left his men to die for the sake of lust.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.821
Antony's no coward. As soon as
they knew they'd lost the battle,

04:07.957 --> 04:11.495
they fled to save the gold
that they'd stowed on Cleopatra's ship.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.376
They plan to fight on, no doubt.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.461
They cannot do that without money.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.252
— Wasn't cowardice.
— That's not what my husband says.

04:19.385 --> 04:21.421
Your husband's a liar.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.336
Dear me,

04:23.472 --> 04:25.929
one might wonder
whose side you're on.

04:26.058 --> 04:29.425
He wasn't like that as a child.
He was a good, honest boy.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.725
I don't know what happened.

04:33.858 --> 04:35.940
I'm to blame, probably.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.645
If you maintain Cleopatra
and her progeny on the throne...

04:40.781 --> 04:44.490
..his honour Mark Antony, by his sacred oath,

04:44.618 --> 04:46.154
will withdraw from public life.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.994
He will reside quietly in Egypt
as a private citizen

04:49.123 --> 04:52.661
and promises never to engage
in any way whatsoever with politics...

04:52.793 --> 04:56.752
Tell him no. He will put himself and his woman
in my hands without conditions.

04:56.881 --> 04:58.166
Yes, sir.

04:58.299 --> 05:02.338
There is a man close to Antony.
His name is Lucius Vorenus.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.506
I want you to speak to him alone.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.799
Tell him Titus Pullo is here

05:06.932 --> 05:10.800
and will answer for his safety
if he can find a way to open the gates.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.599
You can tell him that,
but it won't do any good.

05:14.732 --> 05:19.351
Is there some word we could send him
that he knows comes only from you?

05:19.487 --> 05:23.981
Pullo, if need be,
I will burn down the palace with all inside.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.358
Tell him that his children are well

05:27.495 --> 05:30.077
and that I hope my child is well also.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.657
Privatejoke. He'll understand.

06:46.532 --> 06:47.772
Speak.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.365
His honour Gaius Octavian Caesar

06:50.494 --> 06:53.156
states that his answer is no.

06:53.289 --> 06:55.120
That's all?

06:55.249 --> 06:59.083
He demands that you surrender yourself
and your people without conditions.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.494
Calm.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.293
lam calm.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.417
lam.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.799
You go and tell...

07:11.932 --> 07:16.141
that frog—spawned homunculus...

07:16.270 --> 07:18.261
- Calm.
— ..that l...

07:18.397 --> 07:20.888
We must remain calm.

07:21.984 --> 07:25.101
Vorenus, find this man
a drink or something.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.483
Surrender, he says.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.407
l'd sooner eat my own children
than surrender to him.

07:32.536 --> 07:36.404
We could escape by night in disguise.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.077
We could go south

07:39.209 --> 07:41.200
and...

07:43.631 --> 07:45.667
And hide under bushes

07:45.799 --> 07:48.791
like hunted animals?

07:49.595 --> 07:52.337
No. No, I cannot run.

07:52.473 --> 07:56.182
I will be guided by you, naturally,

07:56.310 --> 07:58.972
if you think there is some other path
available to us.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.057
Death.

08:06.153 --> 08:09.020
Death is available to us.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.522
Is there not some military trick,

08:11.659 --> 08:16.028
some clever ruse to turn things about?
You're so good at that sort of thing.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.950
Oh, piss and blood, woman.

08:21.585 --> 08:25.999
I'm a soldier,
not a fucking magician.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.882
Look around us.

08:34.723 --> 08:38.181
Whores, hermaphrodites

08:38.310 --> 08:40.266
and lickspittles.

08:41.939 --> 08:44.021
This is our army now.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.600
This...

08:49.530 --> 08:51.236
is all we have left.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.989
Titus Pullo says that
your children are well.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.666
He hopes his child is well also.

09:02.626 --> 09:05.584
He says it is a private joke
that you'll understand.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.705
- So he's here?
— And close to Caesar.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.260
He answers for your safety

09:12.386 --> 09:15.549
if you will forsake Antony
and find a way to open the gates.

09:15.681 --> 09:19.219
You tell Titus Pullo that his son is well...

09:20.728 --> 09:22.514
but he has forgotten who I am.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.934
Maybe you should think on it a while.
What other way...

09:26.066 --> 09:28.102
You, emissary.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.066
A challenge.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.659
I challenge your master...

09:40.914 --> 09:43.496
— to single combat.
— Sir?

09:43.625 --> 09:47.664
Let him meet me face to face
with sword and shield,

09:47.796 --> 09:49.912
just as our ancestors did.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.960
Then we shall see
who is the better man.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.129
— Antony.
- No.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.594
This is the way.

09:57.723 --> 10:00.635
How can he refuse?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.724
His honour is at stake.

10:02.853 --> 10:07.768
He must accept,
or he will be exposed as a coward.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.231
Go tell him.
Tell everyone in his camp.

10:14.114 --> 10:18.778
Mark Antony has called the dog out.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.703
Run!

10:28.003 --> 10:29.789
Vorenus...

10:31.298 --> 10:35.132
fetch some weapons.
We shall practise.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.142
— Vorenus.
— Highness.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.432
Octavian's going to kill me,

10:48.565 --> 10:51.022
is he not?

10:51.151 --> 10:54.314
They're negotiating.
It'll be all right.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.402
Do not lie to me.

10:56.532 --> 11:00.616
There can only be one son of Caesar.
If anyone dies, it will be me.

11:00.744 --> 11:05.738
Talk that way loud enough,
the gods'll hear you and they'll make it so.

11:08.752 --> 11:12.210
Come with me to the armoury.
We'll get you a decent sword.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.955
If it comes to a fight,
you can give as good as you get.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.294
Single combat?

11:17.427 --> 11:20.510
- With sword and shield.
— He's gone mad, has he?

11:20.639 --> 11:22.880
I'd say more drunk
or drugged than mad, sir.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.302
What of Cleopatra?
Is she in the same condition?

11:25.435 --> 11:28.927
No, sir. Sober, alert.

11:29.690 --> 11:33.057
— And Lucius Vorenus?
— Remains loyal to Antony.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.650
Thank you. Stay close by.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.820
A siege, then. I'll inform the engineers.

11:41.952 --> 11:45.536
Even a madman could hold that palace
for weeks, months.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.076
- Burn it down, then.
— We need to keep the Egyptian people quiet.

11:48.208 --> 11:52.702
I suspect destroying the royal palace with their
queen inside might make them rather peevish.

11:52.838 --> 11:55.170
What, then?

12:07.352 --> 12:10.310
This is for your queen alone.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.931
No other. Is that clear?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.603
Yes.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.234
Enough.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.710
l amuse you?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.137
No, sir. I assure you...

12:46.266 --> 12:49.929
I'm a fucking clown, am |?

12:52.481 --> 12:54.142
Shall I...

12:54.274 --> 12:57.641
Shall I do a little dance for you?

13:04.534 --> 13:06.820
— Does that please you?
— Your highness...

13:06.954 --> 13:09.536
Stand up.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.251
Give him your sword and shield.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.502
— Let's see if he can do any better.
— Antony.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.295
No.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.633
OK?

13:27.516 --> 13:28.847
Take them!

13:29.643 --> 13:33.010
- Queen majesty, please.
— Don't look to her.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.684
I'm the master here. Now take them.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.825
You ready?

14:28.076 --> 14:31.660
Really, sir, I must protest.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.664
Yes!

14:47.220 --> 14:49.927
Young Hermes has returned.

14:51.975 --> 14:55.843
So, what does the boy say?

14:55.979 --> 14:57.935
When do we meet?

14:58.065 --> 15:01.557
Sir, Octavian Caesar...

15:02.402 --> 15:04.063
respectfully...

15:04.196 --> 15:06.938
refuses your challenge

15:07.074 --> 15:09.611
and asks the same terms as before.

15:11.578 --> 15:16.493
If those terms are not accepted,
fire and siege works will begin tomorrow.

15:19.920 --> 15:24.584
You tell him to shove his terms up his arse.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.172
Good lad.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.935
Coward.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.597
Fucking coward.

15:41.733 --> 15:44.315
He always was a fucking coward.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.983
What are you all looking at?

15:53.120 --> 15:55.577
Enjoy yourselves, you scum!

15:57.457 --> 15:59.118
Eat!

15:59.251 --> 16:01.492
Eat! Eat! Eat!

16:02.546 --> 16:04.753
Drink! Music!

16:06.466 --> 16:08.798
Come and have a drink with me.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.969
Now do you see that?

16:21.106 --> 16:23.472
Do you see that, you gyppo cunts?

16:24.568 --> 16:29.358
That is how a real Roman drinks.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.356
"To her majesty,
Queen Cleopatra Philopator.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.733
"I fully understand that you have been led

16:34.870 --> 16:37.202
"into this predicament
through no fault of your own

16:37.330 --> 16:39.116
"by the renegade Mark Antony.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.830
"If you will deliver him to me,

16:40.959 --> 16:43.041
"either alive or dead being no matter,

16:43.170 --> 16:45.161
"I promise to you on my oath

16:45.297 --> 16:47.253
"that you and your people
will be unharmed

16:47.382 --> 16:49.373
"and treated with all respect.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.673
"You shall retain your crown
and all continent rights."

16:53.805 --> 16:58.674
He asks me
to bring eternal dishonour on my name.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.886
And in return,

17:03.023 --> 17:04.854
your empire,

17:04.983 --> 17:08.396
your people, Majesty's life.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.019
My life for my honour.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.272
Good enough.

17:14.784 --> 17:19.323
— Better than death.
— That is a slave's answer.

17:26.171 --> 17:29.538
Majesty has felt Anubis
breathe on her before now.

17:30.926 --> 17:33.759
She knows her slave is right.
She wants to live.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.888
There you are.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.610
What are you doing here?

17:52.739 --> 17:54.525
Come back to the party.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.569
Maybe later.

17:59.287 --> 18:03.075
What's the matter, poor baby?
Are you sad?

18:04.376 --> 18:06.708
Of course I am sad.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.544
Look at you.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.794
Look at us.

18:12.926 --> 18:16.339
Apollo and lsis, it's pathetic.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.483
I'm sorry. I do not mean that.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.783
No.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.749
No, it's true.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.803
These years together

19:00.932 --> 19:03.309
have been the happiest of my life.

19:07.772 --> 19:10.058
We lived, didn't we?

19:10.191 --> 19:12.318
We did.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.279
Octavian will burn
the palace tomorrow.

19:26.082 --> 19:30.792
We must decide how to end this,
and when.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.794
Yes.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.257
Why not now?

19:43.933 --> 19:47.221
No, dear, let's not go in darkness.

19:47.354 --> 19:50.141
Tomorrow in the sunlight.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.110
Tomorrow.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.706
Shall we go back to our guests?

20:11.252 --> 20:14.085
No, I'm tired.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.580
You go. I don't mind.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.957
Just for a little while maybe.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.896
He had that lovely singing voice.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.732
Took a spear in the eye in Gergovia.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.324
Yes. Gansa.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.455
What of him?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.575
| forgot.

20:55.338 --> 20:56.669
Fuck him.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.295
Do you believe there is an afterlife?

21:05.974 --> 21:07.134
Of course.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.883
There are people who say no.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.553
And this is all there is.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.931
— Who says that?
- Learned men.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.685
— Greeks, probably.
- Greeks?

21:21.114 --> 21:23.446
Greeks talk a whole pile of nonsense.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.361
Fuck 'em.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.696
Fuck 'em.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.675
Mark Antony.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.795
Sir.

21:49.684 --> 21:51.424
What's happened?

22:05.408 --> 22:07.023
"Dearest love,

22:07.160 --> 22:10.072
"forgive me for leaving you this way.

22:10.205 --> 22:13.288
"You know how I hate to say goodbye.

22:13.416 --> 22:16.032
"I will see you again
on the other side.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.911
"Please, come quickly."

22:55.625 --> 22:57.866
Sweet. . .

22:59.629 --> 23:01.244
Why didn't...

23:01.381 --> 23:04.373
Why didn't she wait for me?

23:04.509 --> 23:08.923
The queen must die alone.
It's the custom.

23:11.140 --> 23:14.598
With her last breath
she called your name.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.950
Please, you go away now.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.346
Here it is, then.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.732
Anything to be rid
of this fucking hangover.

24:13.745 --> 24:15.736
This won't do.

24:18.791 --> 24:22.124
Let's use a proper Roman sword.

24:36.934 --> 24:39.141
It's a damn good sword.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.560
It's a good place to die, at any rate.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.898
Could have been a ditch in Gaul.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.661
Men that knew Alexander...

25:00.375 --> 25:01.956
once stood here.

25:02.085 --> 25:04.827
Good a place as any, I suppose.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.956
Lucius Vorenus...

25:12.720 --> 25:14.961
| enter the end.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.888
Don't you die here with me.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.850
You get out while you can.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.969
I'll do that.

25:26.859 --> 25:31.023
It's been an honour
serving with you, sir.

25:31.948 --> 25:34.030
Has it?

25:39.789 --> 25:41.745
I hope so.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.751
Brace it there.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.544
Any instructions or messages, sir?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.720
No.

26:00.768 --> 26:04.511
Just tell the people I died well.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.890
I died Roman.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.321
My poor love.

28:38.843 --> 28:40.925
Bring the children.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.022
Lucius Vorenus wishes to speak?

28:55.151 --> 28:59.110
- No.
— Then he shall stop looking at me.

29:02.867 --> 29:06.030
— I gave you an order.
— I take no orders from you.

29:06.162 --> 29:08.869
I let you live because
Antony was fond of you.

29:08.998 --> 29:11.239
Do not test me now.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.627
Kiss my arse!

29:13.753 --> 29:16.916
You're lucky I don't open your stomach.

29:17.048 --> 29:21.087
I wonder that you had not done the honourable
thing and followed your captain.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.209
Oh, I would.

29:23.346 --> 29:25.803
But I have to get Caesarion out of here.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.719
- What do you mean?
— If he stays, Octavian will kill him.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.467
He's perfectly safe.
I've made a pact with Octavian.

29:31.604 --> 29:34.596
I keep my crown
and no harm will come to my people.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.643
Octavian may let you live

29:36.776 --> 29:39.438
so he can parade you through the Forum
in your crown.

29:39.570 --> 29:42.858
To Antony's children,
he will show public mercy and kindness.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.652
But Caesarion,
another son of Caesar,

29:45.785 --> 29:48.697
— Octavian will kill him.
- No.

29:48.829 --> 29:52.071
— He'sjust a child.
- He'll die.

29:52.208 --> 29:55.621
And for what? We both know
he's not the son of Caesar.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.794
We know nothing of the sort.

29:58.923 --> 30:01.505
l was there at his conception.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.793
Doesn't matter what you say.

30:04.929 --> 30:07.341
He is the son of Caesar.

30:08.182 --> 30:10.844
Whoever he is, he stays here, he dies.

30:10.977 --> 30:14.140
You'd see that if your desire to live
hadn't blinded you.

30:14.271 --> 30:17.479
And you, why would you save him?
What is he to you?

30:17.608 --> 30:21.021
He's nothing.
But his father is my friend.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.235
I'll take the boy to him.

30:25.199 --> 30:28.862
— The man, what's his name?
— Titus Pullo.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.652
Yes.

30:33.040 --> 30:36.624
— Is he a good man?
— Define good.

30:39.797 --> 30:42.038
Children, come.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.556
See.

30:52.685 --> 30:55.051
By his own hand.

30:56.272 --> 30:59.014
That is how nobility dies.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.871
Put on your travelling clothes.

31:17.752 --> 31:21.040
You're leaving with Lucius Vorenus
for your safety.

31:22.131 --> 31:25.214
But my place is here with you.

31:26.635 --> 31:29.547
Travelling clothes, now.

32:20.898 --> 32:22.763
My condolence for your loss.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.481
He died well.

32:24.610 --> 32:28.148
If there's anything we can do for you,
anything you need...

32:28.280 --> 32:31.022
It's so kind of you to ask.

32:31.158 --> 32:33.535
Your wellbeing is my chief concern.

32:33.661 --> 32:37.995
Thank you. l have been so scared.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.740
— But I'm not any more.
- No?

32:40.876 --> 32:43.993
Antony painted you as a cruel monster.

32:45.381 --> 32:47.463
But it is not so.

32:48.425 --> 32:52.134
I sense that you are
a good and honest man.

32:53.556 --> 32:56.468
— I'm not wrong, am |?
- No.

32:58.561 --> 33:01.143
My children and l are perfectly safe.

33:01.272 --> 33:04.105
— You are.
— Even Caesarion?

33:04.233 --> 33:07.066
He's just a boy.
He's no threat to me.

33:10.656 --> 33:14.899
I keep my crown.
I remain queen of Egypt.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.900
You are Egypt.

33:17.037 --> 33:18.868
How could I replace you?

33:20.583 --> 33:22.665
I am content.

33:23.836 --> 33:25.918
We shall be good friends.

33:26.046 --> 33:27.877
We shall.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.917
As a friend,
would you grant me one favour?

33:33.053 --> 33:35.715
- Of course.
— Come with me to Rome.

33:35.848 --> 33:38.885
Let the Roman people see and rejoice

33:39.018 --> 33:41.384
that Egypt and Caesar are reconciled.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.136
I would like that very much.

33:44.273 --> 33:47.060
Perhaps next summer,
when our mourning for Antony is done.

33:47.193 --> 33:49.229
Yes.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.192
Or perhaps sooner.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.197
My ship is large and comfortable.

33:57.036 --> 34:01.245
It's so good of you.
I shall have to consult my priests.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.659
— A voyage so soon after a death...
— Please.

34:03.792 --> 34:08.161
You would be doing me an immense honour
by coming with me as a guest.

34:08.297 --> 34:10.583
I would be eternally grateful.

34:12.176 --> 34:16.135
— How can I refuse?
— And the children, of course.

34:16.263 --> 34:18.424
You must bring the children.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.093
Naturally.

34:20.226 --> 34:23.013
Caesarion is longing to see Rome again.

34:23.145 --> 34:25.136
Good.

34:25.856 --> 34:28.268
— We sail tomorrow.
- So soon?

34:28.400 --> 34:32.234
The winds are with us.
Would be a shame to delay.

34:33.364 --> 34:35.195
Tomorrow, then.

35:04.645 --> 35:06.886
Close the doors!

35:18.367 --> 35:21.234
I'm sorry, my love.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.410
l was hungry to live.

35:32.006 --> 35:34.748
But you were right about that boy.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.669
He's a monster.

35:36.802 --> 35:41.216
He only wants me alive
to parade me in chains

35:41.348 --> 35:43.634
for a mob to spit on.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.986
I lied to you for nothing.

36:02.036 --> 36:04.493
Please don't be angry with me.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.587
Bring the old woman.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.758
She's a sharp little piece.

36:21.055 --> 36:23.091
She'll look well in nothing but chains.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.384
We should have taken her there and then.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.054
Why abduct her
when she'll come of her own accord?

36:28.187 --> 36:30.849
And what if she follows
Mark Antony instead?

36:30.981 --> 36:34.314
She betrayed Antony so that she might live.
Why would she lose heart now?

36:34.443 --> 36:37.025
You can have that effect on people.

36:37.821 --> 36:40.733
No, l was all sweetness and light with her.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.697
Charm itself.

36:42.826 --> 36:45.818
Yes. That is your most
disheartening manner.

36:53.837 --> 36:56.044
The belladonna is not fast...

36:57.633 --> 37:00.295
but it is least painful.

37:01.428 --> 37:04.886
Yes. Yes, I know.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.637
Which leaves one looking best?

37:09.770 --> 37:11.931
I want no bloating or discoloration.

37:12.064 --> 37:14.396
— The snake, but...
— Is it quick?

37:14.525 --> 37:16.231
40 breaths.

37:18.195 --> 37:20.231
The snake, then.

37:36.422 --> 37:39.038
It doesn't look like much.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.467
The one that took Cousin Seth was green.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.586
— Do you remember?
- They vary.

37:45.722 --> 37:48.213
This is the needful animal.

37:50.894 --> 37:52.475
Where's the best spot?

37:52.604 --> 37:55.937
Wrist or breast, no matter.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.772
Thank you.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.448
Make sure the children are safe
before you follow me.

38:06.577 --> 38:08.693
Yes, Majesty.

38:11.039 --> 38:14.702
Now. . . bite.

38:32.019 --> 38:34.101
Nothing.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.851
Oh, yes.

38:40.903 --> 38:42.985
It goes away toward the end.

39:35.082 --> 39:37.243
You...

39:37.376 --> 39:40.493
have a rotten soul.

40:01.275 --> 40:03.266
What did she say?

40:06.238 --> 40:08.479
She said I had a rotten soul.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.030
Find the children!

40:30.596 --> 40:34.965
Caesarion has escaped with Lucius Vorenus.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.307
The man turns loyalty into a vice.

40:37.436 --> 40:39.347
Any notion where they might have gone?

40:39.479 --> 40:41.435
Big country, Egypt.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.726
Even now, I would be happy
to forgive Vorenus

40:46.862 --> 40:48.853
if he surrendered himself and the boy.

40:48.989 --> 40:50.695
— He's made his choices.
— Yes.

40:50.824 --> 40:55.193
It's a shame when it's just the boy needs
to die. If only you could talk to him, Pullo.

40:55.329 --> 40:57.536
I'm sure you could persuade him
of the right course to take.

40:57.664 --> 41:00.155
— Have to find him first.
— Yes.

41:00.292 --> 41:02.499
I could look for him.

41:02.628 --> 41:04.619
Why don't you do that?

41:18.810 --> 41:20.926
When I recover my rightful place

41:21.063 --> 41:23.930
I shall be sure
that you are properly rewarded.

41:24.066 --> 41:27.650
You may choose a province to govern
and any woman of the court.

41:28.695 --> 41:30.435
Thanks.

41:30.989 --> 41:34.732
That life is over. It's best you forget about it.

41:34.868 --> 41:38.235
Nonsense.
My mother would set things aright.

41:38.955 --> 41:40.661
I doubt it.

41:41.667 --> 41:45.876
I wonder my father tolerated
such a pessimist around him.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.620
There'll be no more talk of that sort.

41:56.348 --> 41:57.884
It's just a bird.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.257
I've not been in the desert at night before.

42:00.394 --> 42:02.259
It does not please me.

42:02.396 --> 42:04.182
We shall not do this again.

42:04.314 --> 42:06.555
Get some sleep.
We've got a long ride tomorrow.

42:06.692 --> 42:09.855
— I will sleep when I like.
— You will sleep when | tell you.

42:11.697 --> 42:13.653
What's wrong?

42:18.412 --> 42:20.778
— How's it going?
— Not so bad. You?

42:20.914 --> 42:22.700
Same.

42:25.210 --> 42:28.122
I never thought I'd see that ugly bastard
glaring down at me again, though.

42:28.255 --> 42:30.337
I knew you'd remember.

42:32.509 --> 42:34.750
— This is him, then?
— This is him.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.342
Who is this man?

42:37.889 --> 42:40.801
- Name's Titus Pullo.
— I do not like your manner.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.263
Handsome, isn't he?

42:43.395 --> 42:45.351
What news of my mother?

42:45.480 --> 42:47.641
She's dead. Killed herself.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.316
Best way to go. Honourable.

42:52.446 --> 42:54.232
Do not touch me!

43:24.019 --> 43:26.101
Thought he'd be bigger.

43:29.483 --> 43:32.941
There are ten legions out looking for him.

43:33.069 --> 43:35.811
Patrols on all the roads west to Africa,

43:35.947 --> 43:38.324
all the Upper Nile ports.

43:38.450 --> 43:40.486
The only way to go is south.

43:40.619 --> 43:42.701
So we can cut back across the desert

43:42.829 --> 43:45.161
towards the river at the cataracts.

43:45.290 --> 43:48.498
I'll go with you as far as Judea,
you can get a ship from there.

43:48.627 --> 43:51.289
You can buy a ship if you want.
His mother gave me a heavy purse.

43:51.421 --> 43:53.286
You'll not come with us?

43:53.423 --> 43:56.961
No, l'll head out east maybe.

43:57.093 --> 43:59.049
They always need soldiers out there.

44:00.555 --> 44:03.262
Probably won't even make it out of Egypt.

44:19.825 --> 44:21.907
How are the children?

44:22.035 --> 44:23.650
Well enough.

44:24.663 --> 44:28.702
Vorena the elder
is at the temple of Orbona with Lyde.

44:28.834 --> 44:30.825
Lucius got apprenticed to a stonemason.

44:30.961 --> 44:34.294
Stonemason?
Now that's a decent trade.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.834
He's on fire to be a soldier.

44:36.967 --> 44:40.835
— You're not encouraging him, are you?
— No, course not.

44:41.888 --> 44:44.174
Vorena the younger, now...

44:45.141 --> 44:47.393
she's a little tiger.

44:47.519 --> 44:50.386
Still doesn't speak much, mind, but...

44:50.522 --> 44:52.262
practically runs the tavern.

44:54.693 --> 44:58.686
Anyone misbehaves, she gives 'em a look
like Medusa on the rag.

45:06.621 --> 45:08.703
And Gaia?

45:10.458 --> 45:12.744
— That didn't end so well.
— No?

45:15.922 --> 45:17.913
Long story.

45:41.823 --> 45:44.986
When did you return?
We had no news of your arrival.

45:45.118 --> 45:48.406
We docked this morning at Ostia.
I came directly here.

45:56.755 --> 46:00.498
Mother, Antony is dead.

46:07.307 --> 46:09.138
By his own hand.

46:13.146 --> 46:15.102
| see.

46:17.108 --> 46:21.067
Well, thank you for telling me.

46:22.447 --> 46:25.985
My congratulations.
You're as good as king now.

46:26.117 --> 46:29.450
Not king. Merely first citizen.

46:30.538 --> 46:33.154
Would you care
for some refreshments and water?

46:33.291 --> 46:35.282
Thank you, no.

46:36.127 --> 46:39.995
I'm glad you're not upset. A display of grief now
would have been impolitic.

46:40.131 --> 46:41.871
Of course.

46:42.634 --> 46:44.625
I've no intention of grieving.

46:55.647 --> 46:57.353
So, who are the children?

46:57.482 --> 46:59.939
They're Antony's children —
Helios and Selene.

47:00.068 --> 47:01.933
Trophies.

47:03.530 --> 47:05.145
Poor things.

47:07.117 --> 47:09.358
Perhaps you will look after them for me.

47:09.494 --> 47:12.201
They seem amiable enough,
as far as I can tell.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.195
It would be the charitable thing to do.

47:14.332 --> 47:17.244
Kindly Uncle Octavian shows mercy.

47:18.294 --> 47:20.125
People will love it.

47:20.922 --> 47:24.255
Clever. No end to your cleverness.

47:28.513 --> 47:31.926
You murdered the other one, did you?
Caesarion?

47:33.435 --> 47:35.426
Not yet.

47:35.562 --> 47:37.678
Soon,|hope.

47:38.523 --> 47:41.856
He only offers to parley and says
the whole thing was your fault in the first place

47:41.985 --> 47:43.566
and that me and him should make peace.

47:43.695 --> 47:45.902
- What did you reply?
— l head—butted the cunny

47:46.031 --> 47:48.522
- and bit his tongue out.
— Took that as a no, then, did he?

47:48.658 --> 47:50.614
— You bit out his tongue?
- I did.

47:50.744 --> 47:54.032
— Tasted like chicken.
— That is disgusting.

47:55.915 --> 48:01.035
Cack. 15 gold says I kill more than you.
Best keep clear, boy, it's gonna get wet.

48:01.171 --> 48:02.957
Wait, we can talk our way past.

48:03.089 --> 48:04.295
Gerrae.

48:04.424 --> 48:08.133
As soon as his majesty opens his mouth,
we're cooked.

48:08.261 --> 48:10.752
— Let's just go at 'em.
— No. That's an order.

48:11.556 --> 48:14.138
Grumpy and cautious as ever.

48:14.267 --> 48:16.508
Like an old sheepdog, you.

48:16.644 --> 48:18.384
Salve, Captain.

48:18.521 --> 48:20.978
— Romans, are you?
- We are.

48:21.107 --> 48:23.314
Don't see many citizens out here.
What's your business?

48:23.443 --> 48:26.230
- Hunting sphinxes.
— No such thing as sphinxes.

48:26.362 --> 48:28.227
- Now you tell us.
— We're grain merchants.

48:28.364 --> 48:31.322
We're on the road to Memphis.
We've just lost our way.

48:31.451 --> 48:34.193
— Grain merchants.
- Yeah.

48:34.329 --> 48:36.490
Lost your way.

48:37.916 --> 48:41.329
— What's your name, boy?
- Aeneas.

48:41.461 --> 48:43.702
— A bit haughty for a slave.
— He is.

48:43.838 --> 48:46.500
I beat him regular,
but it doesn't do any good.

48:47.884 --> 48:49.840
On your way, then.

48:57.769 --> 49:00.055
I told you.

49:10.949 --> 49:12.610
Get down!

49:29.467 --> 49:31.378
Get under!

50:19.058 --> 50:21.140
Is he all right?

50:22.520 --> 50:25.227
I've seen worse. He'll be fine.

50:25.356 --> 50:28.848
- No, I'm done.
— Gerrae, you big girl.

50:29.861 --> 50:32.352
It's just a few scratches.

50:34.532 --> 50:37.239
We just need to lay up
somewhere for a rest.

50:37.368 --> 50:39.745
A couple of days,
you'll be back on your feet.

50:39.871 --> 50:42.328
— Take me home.
- Home.

50:42.457 --> 50:45.324
Home's a long way. It's best we just...

50:45.460 --> 50:48.748
I don't want to die in this fucking shithole.

50:51.090 --> 50:53.172
I want to see my children.

50:55.220 --> 50:57.927
Take me home.

50:58.973 --> 51:01.715
All right, brother. All right.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.642
We'll do that.

51:29.545 --> 51:31.672
Helios, stop chasing Antonia.

51:39.055 --> 51:42.172
So, have you chosen a dress?

51:46.688 --> 51:48.895
I think you should wear that blue thing.

51:52.360 --> 51:54.146
I'm not going.

51:54.279 --> 51:57.487
— It's not a matter of choice.
— I don't feel well.

51:57.615 --> 52:00.903
No wonder.
You could choke Vulcan in here.

52:08.626 --> 52:11.117
Today is your triumph as much as his.

52:12.171 --> 52:14.833
Mother to the first citizen,
you should be happy.

52:17.927 --> 52:19.508
Hooray.

52:26.853 --> 52:29.936
All my life, I've watched you
strive for this moment.

52:30.064 --> 52:32.396
Look at you.

52:32.525 --> 52:34.311
lt's amusing, isn't it?

52:37.905 --> 52:40.521
I don't know what I shall do
if you give up.

52:58.926 --> 53:00.917
Today we celebrate

53:01.054 --> 53:03.215
the glory of our beloved imperator

53:03.348 --> 53:06.055
Gaius Octavian Caesar!

53:06.184 --> 53:09.392
And the glorious rebirth of our republic!

53:09.520 --> 53:12.478
At the third hour, all trading will cease!

53:12.607 --> 53:15.940
The Sacred Way must be cleared of traffic!

53:16.069 --> 53:19.311
Servile violators will be whipped!

53:24.827 --> 53:27.204
— Will there be captives tortured?
- Oh, sure.

53:27.330 --> 53:31.073
— Are you sure you won't come?
— I've seen a triumph, I don't...

53:31.209 --> 53:33.621
You three, upstairs, tend to the cart.

53:33.753 --> 53:36.165
- Pullo.
— You're back!

53:38.174 --> 53:40.165
This is Aeneas, a friend.

53:40.301 --> 53:42.883
— Blessings.
— He's from Egypt.

53:43.513 --> 53:46.630
Children, I brought your father home.

53:46.766 --> 53:49.929
— Why did you bring him here?
— He wants to see you.

53:51.145 --> 53:53.557
He's been wounded.

53:53.689 --> 53:55.725
He's going to die, likely.

54:04.409 --> 54:07.492
He should've died weeks ago,
but he wanted to get home.

54:09.747 --> 54:11.658
Won't last long now.

54:11.791 --> 54:13.747
Thank you, Dr Pullo.

54:13.876 --> 54:16.993
You're awake, then? Make up your mind.

54:19.382 --> 54:21.919
- Lyde.
— Hello.

54:25.763 --> 54:27.924
Where are the children?
Where are the children?

54:29.600 --> 54:32.091
Lie still. Lie still.

54:38.192 --> 54:40.274
They don't want to see me.

54:48.119 --> 54:50.201
I understand.

54:52.790 --> 54:55.532
That's all right. They're stubborn.

54:58.629 --> 55:00.915
Stubborn like their mother.

55:04.677 --> 55:06.417
Rest.

55:07.555 --> 55:09.420
Rest.

55:14.479 --> 55:16.185
Pullo.

55:20.485 --> 55:22.646
What's that?

55:22.778 --> 55:25.565
Octavian Caesar.

55:25.698 --> 55:29.941
He's making his official return today.
Big parade.

55:31.162 --> 55:34.074
That's funny. I thought I was dying.

55:56.479 --> 55:58.265
Father?

56:51.409 --> 56:54.901
Ladies, we shall be taking our places
very shortly.

56:55.037 --> 56:57.119
I hope you're all ready.

56:58.124 --> 57:00.786
I'm sorry Mother Atia could not be here.

57:00.918 --> 57:03.295
I'm afraid my husband
will take it as an insult.

57:03.421 --> 57:07.630
- It isn't meant as such.
— I know. I know how fragile she is.

57:07.758 --> 57:10.215
But dear Octavian is so touchy
about these public events.

57:10.344 --> 57:12.460
Everything must be just so.

57:12.597 --> 57:15.304
He has such faith in yourjudgment.

57:15.433 --> 57:18.345
I'm sure he'll forgive her
if you speak kindly of her.

57:18.477 --> 57:19.978
|wi||, |wi||.

57:20.813 --> 57:23.395
It is time. In order of precedence, please.

57:30.114 --> 57:32.321
Hello, ladies.

57:34.827 --> 57:36.818
Mother.

57:37.580 --> 57:41.289
Yes, here I am.
Let's just get this charade over with, shall we?

57:41.417 --> 57:44.705
— Excuse me?
- Yes?

57:45.379 --> 57:47.040
I don't mind, really,

57:47.173 --> 57:49.334
but it is I who should go first.

57:49.467 --> 57:51.458
You will find if you consult the priests,

57:51.594 --> 57:53.755
the wife takes precedence.

57:53.888 --> 57:56.675
I don't give a fuck what the priests say.

57:56.807 --> 58:01.426
I'll not let a vicious little trollop like you
walk ahead of me.

58:04.023 --> 58:05.388
| go first.

58:06.609 --> 58:09.976
I take no offence, of course.
You are not yourself.

58:10.112 --> 58:12.489
I know who you are.

58:12.615 --> 58:14.606
I can see you.

58:15.618 --> 58:20.487
You're swearing now
that someday you'll destroy me.

58:23.751 --> 58:27.460
Remember, far better women than you

58:27.588 --> 58:30.500
have sworn to do the same.

58:30.633 --> 58:33.215
Go and look for them now.

59:55.301 --> 59:59.294
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

1:02:01.051 --> 1:02:02.882
Pullo.

1:02:05.806 --> 1:02:07.967
— We'd given you up for dead.
- No.

1:02:08.100 --> 1:02:11.592
One of these days maybe, but not yet.

1:02:12.438 --> 1:02:14.929
Well, I'm very glad to see you alive.

1:02:15.065 --> 1:02:16.896
Old friends are a rare commodity.

1:02:21.196 --> 1:02:23.448
It's been a long road
we have travelled together.

1:02:23.574 --> 1:02:25.906
It has.

1:02:31.457 --> 1:02:33.789
I sent you to find Caesarion.

1:02:38.130 --> 1:02:40.212
— What happened?
- I found him.

1:02:40.925 --> 1:02:42.881
- He's dead.
— You're certain?

1:02:43.010 --> 1:02:45.342
— Killed him myself.
- How?

1:02:46.096 --> 1:02:48.178
— Cut his throat.
— Where was this?

1:02:48.307 --> 1:02:50.844
In the desert, some 40—odd miles
south of Alex.

1:02:50.976 --> 1:02:53.683
I brought his head to show you,
but it went bad.

1:02:53.812 --> 1:02:56.269
Didn't look like anyone. So I tossed it.

1:02:58.233 --> 1:03:00.610
And Lucius Vorenus?

1:03:00.736 --> 1:03:02.567
Didn't make it.

1:03:03.322 --> 1:03:04.983
That's a shame.

1:03:05.115 --> 1:03:09.028
— It is.
— He was a good man.

1:03:12.414 --> 1:03:15.372
I suppose you'll be wanting
your reward, then.

1:03:16.669 --> 1:03:19.251
I hadn't thought of that.
Wouldn't say no.

1:03:30.641 --> 1:03:32.848
So?

1:03:32.977 --> 1:03:35.059
He bought it.

1:03:35.646 --> 1:03:37.227
Brother Osiris,

1:03:37.356 --> 1:03:39.688
let me live to spit in his face

1:03:39.817 --> 1:03:41.853
and remind him of this day.

1:03:41.986 --> 1:03:44.147
Didn't I tell you there'd be no more
of that blather?

1:03:44.279 --> 1:03:47.442
Blather? It is my sacred duty.

1:03:47.574 --> 1:03:50.737
By my blood, I'll not rest
until I have avenged my mother

1:03:50.869 --> 1:03:53.326
and redeemed my father's name.

1:03:54.331 --> 1:03:57.664
Listen, about your father...
