01:21.916 --> 01:23.617
Hmm.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.098
No!

02:13.100 --> 02:14.435
No!

02:39.827 --> 02:41.963
He took my hand.

02:44.032 --> 02:45.599
He took my hand!

02:54.876 --> 02:57.012
Talulah, stop.

03:03.885 --> 03:05.185
Honey?

03:16.998 --> 03:18.667
Is he early?

03:21.803 --> 03:23.036
Yeah.

03:23.038 --> 03:24.706
It's only the 22nd.

03:26.575 --> 03:28.342
He couldn't wait, John.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.718
- Honey.
- Huh?

03:38.720 --> 03:40.555
I think you might need these.

03:43.325 --> 03:44.390
You okay?

03:44.392 --> 03:46.025
- Me?
- Yeah.

03:46.027 --> 03:49.097
Good, yeah. Yeah, seriously.

03:49.765 --> 03:50.899
I'm good.

03:56.838 --> 03:58.338
Aw.

03:58.340 --> 04:00.273
You'll never believe it.

04:00.275 --> 04:02.410
We're gonna bring you home
a little brother.

04:03.246 --> 04:04.679
Finally.

04:50.293 --> 04:52.092
You want to try
Dr. Lee again?

04:52.094 --> 04:54.662
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay. Just a sec, okay?

04:54.664 --> 04:56.732
Looks good, right?
Everything looks good?

05:02.605 --> 05:03.671
You okay?

05:03.673 --> 05:05.074
- Mmm.
- Good.

05:08.678 --> 05:10.077
Okay?

05:16.819 --> 05:17.952
Listen.

06:17.047 --> 06:18.512
- Good.
- Breathe, baby, breathe.

06:18.514 --> 06:19.848
Good, good.

06:19.850 --> 06:21.383
- Good.
- Breathe.

06:23.519 --> 06:26.420
Take a breath.
Ready? Push.

06:26.422 --> 06:29.157
Push, push, push.

06:29.159 --> 06:30.692
- Good. Push.
- Push, breathe, breathe.

06:32.062 --> 06:34.663
Great, good, good.
Okay...

06:34.665 --> 06:36.064
Here he comes!

06:36.066 --> 06:37.498
Police!
Get down on your knees!

06:37.500 --> 06:38.667
You heard him! Get down!

06:38.669 --> 06:39.734
Stay where you are!

06:39.736 --> 06:41.770
Get down on your knees!

06:41.772 --> 06:43.006
He's got something
behind his back!

06:47.077 --> 06:48.745
- What the hell was that?
- Get a light on him.

06:51.615 --> 06:52.747
Go through the house.

06:52.749 --> 06:53.882
Make sure nobody's inside.

06:53.884 --> 06:55.550
Bravo team, let's go inside.

07:33.557 --> 07:35.426
Oh, you're perfect.

07:38.062 --> 07:39.397
He's perfect.

07:55.679 --> 07:57.780
Are his eyes different colors?

07:57.782 --> 08:00.750
Yeah, it's called
heterochromia.

08:00.752 --> 08:03.488
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's a genetic trait.

08:05.923 --> 08:08.623
Oh, whoa.
He's like David Bowie.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.426
He is.

08:10.428 --> 08:12.962
He is my little glam rocker.

08:12.964 --> 08:15.164
We tried so long to have you.

08:15.166 --> 08:16.834
We weren't sure
you'd ever come.

08:20.938 --> 08:22.640
It's gonna be...

08:24.442 --> 08:25.541
Okay.

08:25.543 --> 08:26.976
There we go.

08:26.978 --> 08:29.378
Isn't he supposed to cry?

08:29.380 --> 08:31.614
Well, most do,
but it's not required.

08:31.616 --> 08:32.881
Is everything all right?

08:32.884 --> 08:35.217
Nothing wrong
with this little guy.

08:35.219 --> 08:37.321
- He is very aware.
- Yes.

08:38.490 --> 08:39.955
Mama.

08:39.957 --> 08:41.857
Did he really just say that?

08:41.859 --> 08:44.162
<i>You know, he's even
been using some words.</i>

08:45.364 --> 08:46.962
That's quite early.

08:46.964 --> 08:48.498
Usually,
language doesn't come on

08:48.500 --> 08:50.300
for about a year or so.

08:50.302 --> 08:52.835
There's nothing wrong.

08:52.837 --> 08:54.504
Your son's
just developing early.

08:54.506 --> 08:57.039
He's what we call
a smarty-pants.

08:57.041 --> 08:58.544
Smarty-pants.

09:00.812 --> 09:03.948
Good job, honey.
Can you show me again?

09:05.917 --> 09:07.750
Put him inside the castle?

09:10.655 --> 09:12.023
What are you reading?

09:12.990 --> 09:15.958
Oh. <i>Nurturing Genius.</i>

09:15.960 --> 09:17.127
Yes.

09:17.129 --> 09:19.431
<i>A Gifted Life.</i>

09:20.598 --> 09:22.499
I'm preparing.

09:22.501 --> 09:24.733
For what?

09:24.735 --> 09:27.070
<i>Miles' brain
isn't wired like other kids.</i>

09:27.072 --> 09:29.106
Oh, oh, oh! Yes!

09:29.108 --> 09:30.240
<i>He's special.</i>

09:30.242 --> 09:31.607
Good job!

09:31.609 --> 09:33.609
And I was thinking, we should
really start thinking

09:33.611 --> 09:35.178
about preschool, seriously.

09:35.180 --> 09:37.514
Preschools? He's two.

09:37.516 --> 09:38.815
Isn't that a bit early?

09:38.817 --> 09:40.919
These aren't regular
preschools. They're special.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.919
It's a preschool.

09:42.921 --> 09:45.055
We need
a letter of recommendation?

09:45.057 --> 09:49.228
Honey,
it's a very good preschool.

10:16.589 --> 10:18.855
Are we going to Dr. Collins?

10:18.857 --> 10:21.091
No, Mom's taking you
to see a different doctor.

10:21.093 --> 10:22.529
Go.

10:24.897 --> 10:26.999
Good. Very fast.

10:27.966 --> 10:29.333
Go.

10:29.335 --> 10:30.601
<i>You were right
to bring him in.</i>

10:30.603 --> 10:32.836
<i>Miles' intelligence
is off the charts.</i>

10:32.838 --> 10:35.672
<i>I don't have an exact score,
but it'll be very high.</i>

10:35.674 --> 10:36.973
How about his behavior?

10:36.975 --> 10:39.343
Is he adjusting well
to preschool?

10:39.345 --> 10:42.480
He's been having a very
difficult time making friends.

10:42.482 --> 10:43.847
Well, Miles' brain is

10:43.849 --> 10:45.949
extremely well-developed
in certain regions,

10:45.951 --> 10:48.452
but there are other areas
that appear to be delayed.

10:48.454 --> 10:50.454
I'm not sure why
he wouldn't be as developed

10:50.456 --> 10:53.324
in those areas,
but we need to watch it.

10:53.326 --> 10:54.991
And you and your husband
should really consider

10:54.993 --> 10:56.627
a dedicated education plan.

10:56.629 --> 10:59.063
There's this excellent school,
it's called Penmark.

10:59.065 --> 11:00.464
It's a little bit
more expensive

11:00.466 --> 11:01.765
than the school
you have him at now,

11:01.767 --> 11:03.000
but they're just outstanding

11:03.002 --> 11:05.169
with kids
with specialized needs,

11:05.171 --> 11:07.171
just like Miles.

11:07.173 --> 11:08.807
I can call ahead for you,
if you like.

11:17.617 --> 11:20.284
Here. Finish your homework
after you eat.

11:21.821 --> 11:23.854
That's not homework,
by the way.

11:23.856 --> 11:25.691
We don't have homework.

11:25.693 --> 11:27.959
Yeah? How come I had homework
when I was a kid?

11:27.961 --> 11:29.896
Because you're not
as smart as me.

11:30.830 --> 11:31.896
Excuse me?

11:31.898 --> 11:32.997
Yeah?

11:32.999 --> 11:35.032
Do you have any paprika?

11:35.034 --> 11:37.134
Paprika? How do you even know
what that is?

11:37.136 --> 11:39.203
I don't know. Just want some.

11:39.205 --> 11:41.573
I am so ready
to go out tonight.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.177
Here.
Knock yourself out.

11:44.712 --> 11:45.878
Ah.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.014
Excuse me.

11:49.315 --> 11:51.583
When did you start using that?

11:51.585 --> 11:53.654
- I don't know.
- Hey.

11:55.221 --> 11:57.491
Can you please do
that eye thing for me?

11:58.392 --> 11:59.426
Um...

12:01.395 --> 12:02.994
There it is!

12:04.230 --> 12:06.230
Do you wanna do
a staring contest?

12:06.232 --> 12:07.701
No, you have to finish
your dinner.

12:09.235 --> 12:10.803
Okay, all right.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.343
Are you ready?

12:18.345 --> 12:19.480
Oh, I'm ready.

12:21.382 --> 12:22.383
One,

12:23.517 --> 12:24.485
two,

12:25.552 --> 12:26.553
three.

12:32.859 --> 12:33.958
- You just blinked!
- I did!

12:33.960 --> 12:35.127
I did, I did, I did!
You win.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.062
- You win! You win!
- Yes!

12:37.064 --> 12:38.230
- Finish.
- No.

12:38.232 --> 12:39.364
- Yes.
- Because that means

12:39.366 --> 12:41.066
you guys are gonna leave me
with Zoe.

12:41.068 --> 12:42.601
But you love Zoe.

12:42.603 --> 12:43.637
I know.

12:44.405 --> 12:45.406
Hey.

12:46.806 --> 12:49.043
Anytime you need a kiss
from me...

12:51.945 --> 12:52.980
Yes.

12:57.084 --> 12:59.720
You want a regular beer
or a fancy beer?

13:00.789 --> 13:01.922
Fancy.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.290
All right, drink up.

13:05.292 --> 13:07.294
We're not leaving
till these are gone.

13:12.499 --> 13:13.633
I still can't believe

13:13.635 --> 13:15.936
we actually live
in the suburbs.

13:17.137 --> 13:18.272
Really?

13:19.641 --> 13:23.676
Doesn't it seem like yesterday
that we were kid-free?

13:23.678 --> 13:27.014
We were drunk all the time
and everything was so fun.

13:30.084 --> 13:32.184
Baby, now we're
totally normal.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.987
But we're still drunk
all the time.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.023
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.525
When I picked up Miles
from school today,

13:39.527 --> 13:41.960
Mr. Schub said that he didn't
wanna join the science club.

13:41.962 --> 13:44.262
Why doesn't he ever wanna do
activities with other kids?

13:44.264 --> 13:46.033
You know what? New rule.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.670
No kid talk on date night.

13:49.804 --> 13:52.137
- Okay.
- Seriously.

13:52.139 --> 13:54.240
- We have a super smart kid.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:54.242 --> 13:55.475
- Is that a bad thing?
- Mmm-mmm.

13:55.477 --> 13:56.542
You want him

13:56.544 --> 13:57.677
- to be like everyone else?
- Mmm-mmm.

13:57.679 --> 13:59.010
- Are we like everyone else?
- No.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.112
No.

14:00.114 --> 14:01.647
I mean, look,

14:01.649 --> 14:03.282
this is our date night.

14:03.284 --> 14:05.286
Yeah, because we're cool.

14:13.628 --> 14:15.894
Your mom said
only two episodes.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.233
Tell you what.

14:20.235 --> 14:24.072
What if we play one game
before bedtime?

14:24.973 --> 14:26.074
Just one.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.175
Hide-and-seek.

14:29.177 --> 14:31.210
Okay. You want me
to count or hide?

14:31.212 --> 14:32.880
You count.

14:32.882 --> 14:34.082
Cool.

14:39.988 --> 14:44.559
One, two, three, four,

14:45.260 --> 14:50.298
five, six, seven, eight,

14:50.900 --> 14:54.267
nine, ten!

14:54.269 --> 14:56.271
Ready or not, here I come!

15:03.211 --> 15:05.246
What're you doing?
You're supposed to hide.

15:09.485 --> 15:10.786
Miles, are you okay?

15:13.988 --> 15:15.458
You want more time?

15:19.060 --> 15:20.962
Okay, cool.

15:23.732 --> 15:28.602
One, two, three, four,

15:28.604 --> 15:33.807
five, six, seven, eight,

15:33.809 --> 15:36.210
nine, ten...

15:36.212 --> 15:41.484
11, 12, 13, 14...

15:42.083 --> 15:43.484
15...

15:46.988 --> 15:49.124
...17, 18...

15:49.658 --> 15:51.058
19...

15:51.060 --> 15:52.161
20.

15:58.267 --> 16:00.971
Okay. Ready or not,
here I come!

16:35.839 --> 16:37.239
Okay, I got you.

16:41.310 --> 16:43.145
Okay, I give up.
You can come up now.

16:46.115 --> 16:47.449
Miles!

17:00.296 --> 17:01.263
Miles?

17:38.668 --> 17:39.803
Miles!

17:41.605 --> 17:43.106
Miles!

17:44.574 --> 17:47.110
I want you to tell me
everything that you remember.

17:51.281 --> 17:54.382
Um, me and Zoe
were watching TV,

17:54.384 --> 17:56.087
then she was hurt.

17:57.587 --> 18:00.423
Then...
Then she started screaming.

18:01.792 --> 18:03.691
And then I saw blood.

18:03.693 --> 18:06.563
Miles, you must remember
something else.

18:07.732 --> 18:10.101
When did Zoe go
into the basement?

18:11.869 --> 18:13.804
I don't know.

18:15.405 --> 18:17.505
She was counting
and then she was hurt.

18:17.507 --> 18:19.307
There was blood everywhere

18:19.309 --> 18:20.475
- and I didn't know what to do.
- Okay.

18:20.477 --> 18:22.410
It's okay, sweetie.

18:22.412 --> 18:24.713
I don't remember anything.

18:24.715 --> 18:27.016
It's okay. It was an accident.

18:28.486 --> 18:30.821
It was just an accident

19:32.283 --> 19:33.718
Talulah.

19:35.486 --> 19:36.820
What's up?

19:38.824 --> 19:39.858
Hey!

20:50.229 --> 20:52.929
What are you doing here?

20:52.931 --> 20:54.866
I heard you talking
in your sleep.

20:56.102 --> 20:57.869
You were having a bad dream.

21:00.039 --> 21:01.240
No, I wasn't.

21:04.442 --> 21:07.612
I mean, it wasn't a bad dream,
it was a good dream.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.413
I wanna work with Hailey.

21:43.415 --> 21:45.685
Sorry, we already made
our plan.

21:53.459 --> 21:55.094
Yeah, go ahead
and use the bathroom, Miles.

22:17.483 --> 22:18.784
Dash.

22:19.886 --> 22:20.953
Dash!

22:24.358 --> 22:25.858
Help him!

22:31.030 --> 22:32.732
What do you see in this one?

22:35.168 --> 22:36.569
A face.

22:38.238 --> 22:39.672
Whose face?

22:40.806 --> 22:42.175
I don't know.

22:45.811 --> 22:47.080
And what do you see
in that one?

22:48.882 --> 22:50.150
Hands.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.054
Whose hands?

22:56.356 --> 22:58.058
The hands of a nice lady.

23:02.262 --> 23:04.829
When you hit that boy
at school,

23:04.831 --> 23:06.867
can you remember
what you were feeling?

23:11.371 --> 23:13.674
You can tell me how you felt.

23:15.108 --> 23:19.512
I thought if I did it,
I wouldn't get hurt anymore.

23:21.048 --> 23:22.249
Get hurt?

23:23.083 --> 23:25.052
Has someone hurt you?

23:27.354 --> 23:29.020
I'm afraid to tell you.

23:29.022 --> 23:30.958
I don't want anyone
to get in trouble.

23:32.459 --> 23:34.161
Who?
Get who in trouble?

23:36.563 --> 23:38.765
The person
who's been hurting me.

23:40.667 --> 23:41.766
<i>I want to consider</i>

23:41.768 --> 23:43.702
<i>a course of medication
for Miles</i>

23:43.704 --> 23:45.770
and he may need a specialist.

23:45.772 --> 23:48.374
A behavioral interventionist,
someone who can help him

23:48.376 --> 23:49.943
- with his anger issues.
- Okay.

23:51.044 --> 23:52.311
What's wrong with him?

23:52.313 --> 23:54.045
At first, I thought
it might be a deficit

23:54.047 --> 23:56.881
in his cognitive morality
or maybe ODD...

23:56.883 --> 23:59.220
Oppositional defiance
disorder, but honestly...

24:00.587 --> 24:02.388
I'm not sure.

24:02.390 --> 24:04.457
Maybe you should listen
to this.

24:04.459 --> 24:06.427
I recorded this
while he was sleeping.

24:07.328 --> 24:08.495
Yeah, okay.

24:09.629 --> 24:11.165
Sarah, I hate to ask this.

24:11.898 --> 24:13.598
Is there any possibility

24:13.600 --> 24:16.335
that Miles has suffered
some kind of abuse

24:16.337 --> 24:18.039
from someone in your family?

24:19.806 --> 24:21.506
What the hell
are you accusing me of?

24:21.508 --> 24:23.476
I am not accusing you
of anything, John.

24:23.478 --> 24:24.909
I'm telling you what she said.

24:24.911 --> 24:26.580
I never touched our son.

24:27.281 --> 24:28.749
Is this about my dad?

24:31.452 --> 24:33.953
My dad was a piece of shit.

24:33.955 --> 24:36.688
I have processed all of that.
You know that.

24:36.690 --> 24:39.258
That was part of us
deciding to have kids.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.628
I would never hit Miles.
I love that kid.

24:42.497 --> 24:44.463
<i>Maybe Strasser's wrong.</i>

24:44.465 --> 24:45.998
<i>You've always said
he's wired differently.</i>

24:46.000 --> 24:47.333
<i>What if this is
just the way he is?</i>

24:47.335 --> 24:48.533
<i>This is not the way
that he is.</i>

24:48.535 --> 24:49.835
<i>All right.</i>

24:49.837 --> 24:52.138
<i>I don't understand
what's happening, John.</i>

24:52.140 --> 24:54.206
<i>I don't understand
what's going on.</i>

25:04.052 --> 25:05.885
I just checked on him.

25:05.887 --> 25:07.989
That medication
really knocked him out.

25:10.391 --> 25:11.724
You okay?

25:11.726 --> 25:13.661
Mmm.

25:22.703 --> 25:23.838
I'm sorry.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.242
We're gonna
figure this out, all right?

25:36.017 --> 25:37.319
Yeah.

25:42.524 --> 25:45.227
Hey, I'm worried
about you, too.

25:46.328 --> 25:48.894
I feel like
I'm going crazy.

25:48.896 --> 25:50.199
It's gonna be okay.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.068
We just have to keep strong.

25:54.669 --> 25:55.770
Okay?

25:58.574 --> 25:59.707
Okay.

27:05.307 --> 27:07.174
Go fuck yourself.

27:30.099 --> 27:31.798
What is it?

27:31.800 --> 27:33.301
What happened? What happened?

27:33.303 --> 27:34.468
There's someone in here.

27:34.470 --> 27:35.636
Where?

27:35.638 --> 27:36.937
He's in here.

27:36.939 --> 27:38.606
Honey, it sounds like you
were having a bad dream.

27:38.608 --> 27:40.308
- No. No.
- There's no one in here.

27:40.310 --> 27:43.513
No. He's in here.

27:44.180 --> 27:46.981
He's inside here.

27:46.983 --> 27:49.686
- He's inside here.
- Okay, come here. Oh, baby.

28:18.381 --> 28:21.384
Arthur, hi. Elaine Strasser.

28:23.721 --> 28:26.055
Yeah, do you...
Do you have a minute?

28:34.498 --> 28:36.330
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi.

28:36.332 --> 28:37.735
They lock it up
on the weekends.

28:39.102 --> 28:42.071
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice.

28:45.842 --> 28:48.410
Arthur Jacobson.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

28:48.412 --> 28:49.613
Hello.

28:52.915 --> 28:54.716
Has Elaine explained anything

28:54.718 --> 28:56.185
about the type
of research I do?

28:57.588 --> 28:59.053
Good.

28:59.055 --> 29:00.389
I'd like to start
with a few questions

29:00.391 --> 29:01.725
before we get into that.

29:02.925 --> 29:04.058
Okay.

29:04.060 --> 29:05.294
Does anyone in your family

29:05.296 --> 29:06.563
speak a foreign language,
Sarah?

29:07.531 --> 29:09.131
John and I both took Spanish

29:09.133 --> 29:10.532
in high school
but neither of us

29:10.534 --> 29:11.966
remember more than
a few words.

29:11.968 --> 29:14.169
And what about
the boy's grandparents?

29:14.171 --> 29:16.271
Any recent immigrants
in your family?

29:16.273 --> 29:17.807
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

29:19.777 --> 29:20.778
Is this your son's voice?

29:35.559 --> 29:37.659
Yes. Yes, that's Miles.

29:37.661 --> 29:41.063
It's just some gibberish
from a dream.

29:41.065 --> 29:43.632
Actually, it's not gibberish.

29:43.634 --> 29:46.103
I had the words translated
by a colleague of mine.

29:46.637 --> 29:47.638
What is it?

29:48.172 --> 29:49.838
Hungarian.

29:49.840 --> 29:52.441
Specifically,
a rare dialect of Hungarian

29:52.443 --> 29:54.478
only spoken
near the Romanian border.

29:55.879 --> 29:57.579
Listen to what
happens next, Sarah.

29:57.581 --> 29:58.980
This is equally important.

29:58.982 --> 30:01.151
<i>I heard you
talking in your sleep.</i>

30:02.319 --> 30:04.021
<i>You were having a bad dream.</i>

30:05.956 --> 30:07.324
<i>No, I wasn't.</i>

30:10.928 --> 30:14.797
<i>I mean, it wasn't a bad dream,
it was a good dream.</i>

30:15.866 --> 30:17.433
Miles says
it was a good dream.

30:17.435 --> 30:18.801
Why is that important?

30:18.803 --> 30:21.506
The words, Sarah.
What Miles said.

30:24.542 --> 30:26.442
"Shut up, you filthy whore.

30:26.444 --> 30:28.877
"Stop crying
or I'll cut your eyes out.

30:28.879 --> 30:30.446
"I'm going to watch you die."

30:30.448 --> 30:32.315
No. No, Miles did not
say that.

30:32.317 --> 30:34.049
But he did.

30:34.051 --> 30:35.718
And he did it in a dialect

30:35.720 --> 30:39.689
spoken by less than
400,000 people in the world.

30:39.691 --> 30:41.393
Does Miles get along well
with children his age?

30:43.026 --> 30:46.197
Has he ever mentioned
feeling displaced in his body?

30:47.799 --> 30:48.964
Yes.

30:48.966 --> 30:51.167
What about his taste in food?

30:51.169 --> 30:52.537
Have you noticed
any change in his palate?

30:54.539 --> 30:55.971
These are indicators.

30:55.973 --> 30:57.375
Indicators of what?

31:02.013 --> 31:05.248
Half the people on earth,
billions of them,

31:05.250 --> 31:07.917
believe that consciousness
and energy,

31:07.919 --> 31:10.520
what we often
refer to as our souls,

31:10.522 --> 31:12.422
are capable of returning

31:12.424 --> 31:15.057
to this physical realm
to live new lives.

31:15.059 --> 31:17.727
It's only foreign
to Western minds.

31:17.729 --> 31:19.863
In most of the world,

31:19.865 --> 31:22.567
reincarnation is an accepted
part of life.

31:24.102 --> 31:25.503
Reincarnation?

31:30.709 --> 31:33.376
What are we talking about?

31:33.378 --> 31:36.412
Let me tell you about a boy
I met when I was in India.

31:36.414 --> 31:39.048
His name was Padman,
around six years old.

31:39.050 --> 31:41.685
But his family claimed
he was much older.

31:41.687 --> 31:45.455
He could remember every detail
from a previous life.

31:45.457 --> 31:47.891
The bakery he owned,
his siblings,

31:47.893 --> 31:50.694
his mother's favorite song.

31:50.696 --> 31:52.463
He even described
his death in detail,

31:52.465 --> 31:54.865
what it felt like
when he was drowning.

31:54.867 --> 31:57.033
I found the town he described

31:57.035 --> 31:58.535
about 100 miles
from his village,

31:58.537 --> 32:00.604
and I took Padman there.

32:00.606 --> 32:03.607
He showed me directly to
the house where he was born.

32:03.609 --> 32:05.642
Introduced me
to his brothers and sisters

32:05.644 --> 32:08.312
who were by now
over 50 years old.

32:08.314 --> 32:11.113
We stayed there
for three weeks

32:11.115 --> 32:13.417
with an old woman
he claimed to be his mother,

32:13.419 --> 32:15.955
singing to her
as she passed away.

32:18.290 --> 32:19.957
Now, I believe

32:19.959 --> 32:22.593
that the soul inside Padman

32:22.595 --> 32:26.365
drowned before he had a chance
to say goodbye to his mother.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.633
And when we allowed
this entity

32:29.635 --> 32:32.001
to finish what it had
left undone,

32:32.003 --> 32:33.670
Padman returned
to being a little boy.

32:33.672 --> 32:35.839
In an instant,
he was back,

32:35.841 --> 32:38.475
with very little memory
of what had happened.

32:38.477 --> 32:40.777
This would explain so much.

32:40.779 --> 32:42.779
The crucial thing
to understand here

32:42.781 --> 32:45.984
is that these souls
return for a reason.

32:45.986 --> 32:48.085
To complete something
left unfinished,

32:48.087 --> 32:49.653
to find closure.

32:49.655 --> 32:51.154
So, you're saying
that my son is possessed?

32:51.156 --> 32:53.790
No. Possession refers to
a non-human entity

32:53.792 --> 32:56.126
taking control
of a human host.

32:56.128 --> 32:58.764
So the invading soul
in my son

32:59.900 --> 33:01.164
was another human?

33:01.166 --> 33:03.970
Yes. And from what I heard
on that tape,

33:05.504 --> 33:06.873
that person is dangerous.

33:08.975 --> 33:12.777
Sarah, there's a battle
being waged inside your son.

33:12.779 --> 33:17.984
A war between his natural soul
and this older one.

33:19.686 --> 33:21.218
These two entities
cannot exist

33:21.220 --> 33:23.120
in the same body forever.

33:23.122 --> 33:25.857
One will become dominant

33:25.859 --> 33:27.727
and the other
will be absorbed.

33:28.795 --> 33:31.061
This is what
we're trying to avoid.

33:31.063 --> 33:32.532
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

33:34.366 --> 33:36.366
Sarah. Sarah, wait.

33:36.368 --> 33:39.069
Just, please...
Just watch this.

33:39.071 --> 33:41.573
I know how hard
this is for you.

33:41.575 --> 33:43.577
I thought that you were
gonna help my son.

33:44.744 --> 33:46.880
Miles may have
developmental issues,

33:47.747 --> 33:49.649
but he is still my son.

33:51.183 --> 33:53.553
And I am not going
to subject him to this.

34:19.612 --> 34:22.114
Hey, Mom,
wanna do a staring contest?

34:24.818 --> 34:26.719
I'm not in the mood
right now, Miles.

34:32.927 --> 34:34.292
Okay.

34:41.902 --> 34:43.503
One, two,

34:44.071 --> 34:45.237
three.

35:20.474 --> 35:23.142
I don't like it when you
touch me like that, Miles.

35:26.814 --> 35:28.082
What is that song?

35:29.617 --> 35:30.685
What?

35:31.952 --> 35:33.921
That song
you were just humming.

35:35.356 --> 35:36.822
I've heard you
singing it before.

35:36.824 --> 35:38.123
Where did you learn it?

35:38.125 --> 35:40.025
- From you.
- No, you didn't.

35:40.027 --> 35:41.429
I would've remembered.

35:42.697 --> 35:45.631
You used to sing it to me
when I was a baby.

35:45.633 --> 35:47.101
While I was sleeping.

35:50.438 --> 35:51.439
No, I didn't.

35:55.976 --> 35:57.342
Excuse me.

35:57.344 --> 35:58.612
I'm sorry.

36:09.623 --> 36:10.890
<i>Andrea and Bruce</i>

36:10.892 --> 36:12.125
<i>of Lafayette, Louisiana,</i>

36:12.127 --> 36:14.226
<i>are a highly educated
modern couple.</i>

36:14.228 --> 36:17.229
<i>To them, the possibility that
their little son, James,</i>

36:17.231 --> 36:19.799
<i>was manifesting signs
of a former life</i>

36:19.801 --> 36:22.202
<i>was, well, a little out there.</i>

36:22.204 --> 36:24.037
<i>Between the ages
of two and four,</i>

36:24.039 --> 36:26.405
<i>James would reveal
extraordinary details</i>

36:26.407 --> 36:28.875
<i>about the life
of a former fighter pilot.</i>

36:28.877 --> 36:30.509
<i>I believe
that he had a past life</i>

36:30.511 --> 36:32.411
<i>and he came back</i>

36:32.413 --> 36:34.480
<i>because he wasn't finished
with something.</i>

36:34.482 --> 36:35.547
<i>We are taught
at a very early age...</i>

36:35.549 --> 36:37.249
What is that?

36:37.251 --> 36:39.384
<i>...that reincarnation
doesn't exist.</i>

36:39.386 --> 36:40.820
A colleague of Dr. Strasser's

36:40.822 --> 36:42.454
gave it to me.

36:42.456 --> 36:44.256
You went to see
another doctor?

36:44.258 --> 36:46.993
His name is Arthur Jacobson

36:46.995 --> 36:49.164
and he studies reincarnation.

36:51.733 --> 36:52.832
Reincarnation?

36:52.834 --> 36:54.033
Mmm-hmm.

36:54.035 --> 36:55.235
- Past lives?
- Yes.

36:55.237 --> 36:57.269
Oh, come on, Sarah.

36:57.271 --> 36:58.705
This is the oldest trick
in the book.

36:58.707 --> 36:59.773
He knows from Strasser

36:59.775 --> 37:01.107
that we're having trouble
with Miles.

37:01.109 --> 37:03.143
Just look at this.

37:03.145 --> 37:05.712
Just look at this little boy.
He...

37:05.714 --> 37:07.547
It's incredible.

37:07.549 --> 37:10.083
Please. Hey.

37:10.085 --> 37:12.387
Please don't tell me
you believe in any of this.

37:13.955 --> 37:17.224
I don't know what I believe.

37:17.226 --> 37:19.125
Miles is sick.

37:19.127 --> 37:20.695
This isn't about past lives.

37:23.298 --> 37:24.533
This is hard.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.734
But we can get through this.

37:27.736 --> 37:29.435
We can help Miles.

37:29.437 --> 37:31.606
Just not with
this kind of craziness.

37:34.376 --> 37:36.376
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:36.378 --> 37:37.479
You're right.

37:38.713 --> 37:39.815
Not with this.

37:41.483 --> 37:43.418
This is nuts.

37:54.864 --> 37:56.165
Hey, Miles?

37:57.266 --> 37:59.332
Five minutes, then PJs, okay?

38:00.669 --> 38:03.037
Talulah! Get!

38:03.039 --> 38:04.140
What did you say, Mommy?

38:26.494 --> 38:27.763
What?

38:36.973 --> 38:38.539
Who can tell me
the difference between

38:38.541 --> 38:41.177
the denominator
and the numerator?

38:42.979 --> 38:44.180
Anyone?

38:45.548 --> 38:47.982
Okay,
I have a better question.

38:47.984 --> 38:49.216
Who likes pizza?

38:49.218 --> 38:50.551
Me! Me! Me!

38:50.553 --> 38:53.222
Oh, yes. So,
how many slices on a pizza?

39:24.587 --> 39:25.987
<i>Kill him, take his weapon!</i>

39:27.124 --> 39:28.524
<i>Good job, soldier!</i>

39:32.428 --> 39:33.627
<i>I need a medic!</i>

39:33.629 --> 39:35.032
<i>Take cover! Take cover!</i>

39:37.200 --> 39:38.567
Talulah!

39:45.508 --> 39:47.441
Sarah?

39:47.443 --> 39:49.510
You seen Talulah?

39:49.512 --> 39:50.513
No.

39:51.614 --> 39:53.048
The back gate's open.

39:53.050 --> 39:55.050
I'm gonna go look for her.

39:55.052 --> 39:57.285
- <i>Take him down!</i>
- Miles.

39:57.287 --> 40:00.121
Honey, go help your dad
look for the dog.

40:00.123 --> 40:01.389
<i>Double kill!</i>

40:01.391 --> 40:02.757
Miles?

40:02.759 --> 40:05.527
<i>Finish him off, soldier!</i>

40:05.529 --> 40:06.797
<i>Head shot!</i>

40:09.099 --> 40:10.801
<i>Kill him! Now!</i>

40:12.269 --> 40:14.137
<i>Move, move, soldier!
Move!</i>

40:16.573 --> 40:17.741
Let's go.

40:34.157 --> 40:36.159
She never goes this far away
from the house.

40:37.295 --> 40:39.397
Maybe she got hit by a car.

40:41.299 --> 40:42.300
Why would you say that?

40:43.334 --> 40:45.600
When a dog knows
it's gonna die,

40:45.602 --> 40:47.669
it doesn't come home.

40:47.671 --> 40:50.172
They drag themselves
under a house.

40:50.174 --> 40:51.742
They like to die alone.

40:53.478 --> 40:55.480
We all have to go sometime.

40:56.481 --> 40:57.514
Even you.

40:59.183 --> 41:00.351
You're gonna die.

41:03.587 --> 41:04.652
I'm your father, Miles,

41:04.654 --> 41:06.688
you do not talk to me
like that.

41:06.690 --> 41:08.357
Or what?

41:08.359 --> 41:10.292
Are you gonna hit me?

41:10.294 --> 41:12.662
Like your father
used to do to you?

41:13.830 --> 41:15.099
What are you talking about?

41:16.134 --> 41:18.334
He was such a piece of shit.

41:18.336 --> 41:21.671
And now,
you're such a great dad to me.

41:23.041 --> 41:25.673
<i>You never told him
anything about my dad?</i>

41:25.675 --> 41:28.077
Never, honey, I've never said
anything to him.

41:28.079 --> 41:29.644
He was saying
all this creepy shit.

41:29.646 --> 41:31.180
Like what?
John, what was he saying?

41:31.182 --> 41:32.715
How would he know?

41:32.717 --> 41:34.185
Know what?

41:36.054 --> 41:37.288
What the hell is that?

41:42.827 --> 41:44.226
It's a camera.

41:44.228 --> 41:45.531
What?

41:46.532 --> 41:47.797
Oh, my God.

41:47.799 --> 41:49.700
He used
the baby monitor.

41:50.902 --> 41:52.504
He's been spying on us.

41:56.542 --> 41:58.007
Hey!

41:58.009 --> 42:00.376
How long have you been
watching us? Hmm?

42:00.378 --> 42:02.011
- Look at me. Where's Talulah?
- I don't know.

42:02.013 --> 42:03.112
- Where is she?
- I don't know!

42:03.114 --> 42:04.180
- Where is she?
- John, stop it!

42:04.182 --> 42:05.183
What the hell's wrong
with you?

42:12.391 --> 42:15.224
Where's Daddy?

42:15.226 --> 42:17.728
Daddy needed
a little bit of space.

42:19.264 --> 42:21.597
He's at Uncle Tommy's house.

42:21.599 --> 42:24.001
Just until he cools down
a little bit.

42:26.238 --> 42:27.406
Mommy?

42:32.244 --> 42:34.246
What's wrong with me?

42:40.718 --> 42:41.953
Miles,

42:43.754 --> 42:44.957
you're sick.

42:47.092 --> 42:48.693
You're just sick, honey.

42:54.699 --> 42:58.103
Sometimes I leave my body
when I'm lying in bed.

43:04.209 --> 43:07.477
Sometimes dreams
can feel real.

43:07.479 --> 43:10.315
They're not dreams,
I do it when I'm awake.

43:13.952 --> 43:15.654
I do it to make room.

43:20.159 --> 43:21.660
Make room for what?

43:22.494 --> 43:23.795
Things.

43:27.966 --> 43:29.935
How often does this happen?

43:32.804 --> 43:34.306
Every night.

44:20.053 --> 44:21.221
Miles?

44:26.059 --> 44:27.694
Miles, what's wrong?

44:30.396 --> 44:32.332
Mommy, I'm scared.

44:36.069 --> 44:37.337
Come here, baby.

44:38.705 --> 44:40.338
- Come here.
- Mommy!

44:48.548 --> 44:50.149
Were you having a dream?

44:55.488 --> 44:57.023
Yes.

45:02.996 --> 45:05.498
Can I sleep with you tonight?

45:42.736 --> 45:43.936
Mommy?

45:50.744 --> 45:52.146
Yes, baby?

45:54.648 --> 45:57.484
Will you always love me

45:58.918 --> 46:01.088
no matter what I do?

46:06.660 --> 46:08.162
Yes, Miles.

46:11.598 --> 46:13.233
I will always love you.

46:17.938 --> 46:19.406
I'm your mother.

46:48.936 --> 46:50.437
What... What is it?

48:35.444 --> 48:36.779
Mommy?

48:39.548 --> 48:40.783
Use this.

48:45.821 --> 48:46.988
Miles,

48:47.957 --> 48:49.290
what did you do?

48:51.560 --> 48:53.760
Sometimes
when I leave my body,

48:53.762 --> 48:55.063
bad things happen.

49:14.015 --> 49:15.084
Mommy!

49:15.751 --> 49:16.852
Miles,

49:17.987 --> 49:19.355
be quiet.

49:44.547 --> 49:46.181
It was my fault.

49:47.182 --> 49:48.317
It was me.

50:03.833 --> 50:06.235
Listen to me.

50:08.905 --> 50:12.374
I'm gonna take you to somebody
who can help you get better.

50:17.914 --> 50:20.684
Sarah. I was so relieved
when you called.

50:21.518 --> 50:23.283
So you must be Miles.

50:25.555 --> 50:27.424
Watch the silver eye.

50:29.426 --> 50:31.059
Just watch.

50:31.061 --> 50:34.094
The regression won't work
if you're in the room.

50:34.096 --> 50:35.398
Is this going to hurt him?

50:36.066 --> 50:38.399
No. It's hypnosis.

50:38.401 --> 50:41.168
Miles goes out of body when
the invading soul is present.

50:41.170 --> 50:43.237
He won't even remember
the experience.

50:43.239 --> 50:46.708
The goal here is to identify
the person who has returned

50:46.710 --> 50:48.376
and, this is important...

50:48.378 --> 50:50.778
Find out what they want.

50:50.780 --> 50:52.749
I'm going to be candid
with you, Sarah.

50:54.284 --> 50:56.618
This may be your last chance.

50:56.620 --> 50:59.054
<i>Miles is eight now.</i>

50:59.056 --> 51:01.858
Soon the invading soul
will have control

51:02.759 --> 51:04.427
and Miles will be gone.

51:07.263 --> 51:09.699
Watch the silver eye
on top of the arm.

51:10.500 --> 51:12.767
Every time it swings,

51:12.769 --> 51:16.304
let's pretend we're unraveling
a piece of string

51:16.306 --> 51:17.741
little by little.

51:20.276 --> 51:22.878
Let's pretend
that piece of string

51:22.880 --> 51:24.545
is time.

51:24.547 --> 51:27.482
Unraveling minute by minute,

51:27.484 --> 51:29.317
second by second,

51:29.319 --> 51:30.955
going backwards.

51:31.722 --> 51:34.457
Time slipping away.

51:35.291 --> 51:36.827
Everything around you...

51:37.795 --> 51:39.828
This house,

51:39.830 --> 51:41.730
my voice,

51:41.732 --> 51:43.832
your mother...

51:43.834 --> 51:47.836
All these things
are getting further away.

51:47.838 --> 51:50.306
We're going back
through your life,

51:52.175 --> 51:54.344
back to when
you started school,

51:56.013 --> 51:58.482
when you first learned
to walk,

52:00.183 --> 52:02.586
when you were just a baby.

52:04.488 --> 52:07.992
Back to the day you were born.

52:13.764 --> 52:16.267
Back to the time
before this body.

52:23.107 --> 52:25.974
I'm no longer speaking
to Miles.

52:25.976 --> 52:27.342
I'm speaking to the person

52:27.344 --> 52:29.947
who has taken residence
inside his body.

52:30.681 --> 52:33.382
You came uninvited.

52:33.384 --> 52:35.953
Tell me
if you can hear my voice.

52:46.564 --> 52:48.831
You speak Hungarian.

52:51.368 --> 52:52.735
I learned a few words

52:52.737 --> 52:54.805
in anticipation
of meeting you.

52:56.240 --> 52:58.009
I prefer English.

52:59.310 --> 53:01.213
But you were born in Hungary?

53:02.513 --> 53:05.148
My parents were
Hungarian farmers

53:05.150 --> 53:06.752
that moved to Ohio.

53:08.820 --> 53:10.222
Simple people.

53:11.923 --> 53:14.425
Just happy
to own the piece of land.

53:16.728 --> 53:18.864
I was driven to more

53:21.133 --> 53:22.768
creative things.

53:26.238 --> 53:28.738
I would like you
to tell me your name

53:28.740 --> 53:30.709
and why you've come back here.

53:33.478 --> 53:34.913
What is your name?

53:37.381 --> 53:39.117
I am Miles now.

53:40.552 --> 53:44.387
Miles, if you can hear
my voice,

53:44.389 --> 53:46.958
tell me the name of the person
inside you.

53:49.561 --> 53:51.029
Tell me the name.

53:54.766 --> 53:56.101
Tell me the name.

53:59.437 --> 54:00.472
Tell me the name.

54:01.973 --> 54:04.109
Miles, tell me the name.

54:06.611 --> 54:07.779
No!

54:22.128 --> 54:24.627
You have quite a collection
of medication

54:24.629 --> 54:25.931
in your bathroom.

54:27.766 --> 54:30.301
Everything there is legal.

54:30.303 --> 54:33.471
Not if you give it
to a minor against his will.

54:35.841 --> 54:37.642
Did you take my pills?

54:39.744 --> 54:41.477
What would Sarah think

54:41.479 --> 54:44.647
if I told her
I fell asleep in here

54:44.649 --> 54:47.485
and woke up with your cock
in my mouth?

54:49.155 --> 54:52.790
Then the police find drugs
in my blood.

54:52.792 --> 54:56.361
The same drugs
from your medicine cabinet.

54:57.864 --> 55:00.831
Not to mention
the pubic hairs with your DNA

55:00.833 --> 55:03.033
that I found
on the rim of your toilet

55:03.035 --> 55:05.104
and placed in my teeth.

55:08.040 --> 55:09.275
You're insane.

55:10.776 --> 55:12.011
Mmm.

55:13.212 --> 55:15.346
Who will they believe?

55:15.348 --> 55:18.618
An aging hippie living off
his family's fortune?

55:20.052 --> 55:22.188
Or an innocent little boy?

55:25.658 --> 55:28.192
When I snap my fingers,

55:28.194 --> 55:30.527
Miles will return

55:30.529 --> 55:35.399
and you will tell Sarah that
you have failed to regress him

55:35.401 --> 55:38.070
because there isn't anyone
inside her son.

55:39.239 --> 55:41.339
Then you will leave

55:41.341 --> 55:45.210
and that will be the last time
you will ever see us.

55:46.913 --> 55:49.147
One,

55:49.149 --> 55:51.249
two,

55:51.251 --> 55:52.652
three.

55:59.359 --> 56:00.925
How did it go?

56:00.927 --> 56:03.494
It didn't.
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

56:03.496 --> 56:05.865
It was a mistake
to ask you to come here.

56:06.599 --> 56:07.933
What happened?

56:07.935 --> 56:09.935
Nothing.
The regression didn't work.

56:09.937 --> 56:11.269
- What?
- I'm sorry.

56:11.271 --> 56:13.206
- What?
- Christopher will see you out.

56:14.440 --> 56:16.176
This way, please.

57:09.997 --> 57:11.332
Miles.

57:11.898 --> 57:13.332
Go inside.

57:13.334 --> 57:15.836
I need to talk to your father.

57:32.453 --> 57:35.156
I don't feel safe with him
in the house.

57:37.824 --> 57:39.860
I made some calls
while I was at Tommy's.

57:42.196 --> 57:44.198
There's a place
called Summit Hill.

57:45.866 --> 57:47.601
I think Miles
would be a good fit.

57:49.504 --> 57:51.805
He would have
round-the-clock supervision.

57:53.007 --> 57:54.876
It's less than an hour
from here.

58:00.882 --> 58:03.115
We're talking
about locking up our son?

58:05.887 --> 58:07.221
What else can we do?

58:08.189 --> 58:10.191
This is tearing us apart,
Sarah.

58:28.342 --> 58:29.543
- Hello?
- <i>Sarah.</i>

58:29.545 --> 58:31.744
It's Arthur Jacobson.

58:31.746 --> 58:33.345
Arthur, it's 2:00 a.m.

58:33.347 --> 58:35.081
<i>I know.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.</i>

58:35.083 --> 58:36.485
<i>Is Miles near you?</i>

58:38.086 --> 58:39.819
Yes, he's in his room.

58:39.821 --> 58:41.353
<i>Sarah,</i>

58:41.355 --> 58:43.355
<i>go to your computer.</i>

58:43.357 --> 58:45.492
Arthur, I'm gonna hang up
the phone.

58:45.494 --> 58:46.892
<i>Sarah, wait.</i>

58:46.894 --> 58:48.227
Your family's in danger.

58:48.229 --> 58:50.499
Go to a computer where Miles
won't be able to see you.

58:51.699 --> 58:53.032
Hang on.

58:53.034 --> 58:54.434
<i>Listen to me.</i>

58:54.436 --> 58:58.170
<i>The person inside your son
is an exceptional liar.</i>

58:58.172 --> 59:01.241
<i>He'll pretend he's sleeping,
he'll pretend he's your son.</i>

59:01.243 --> 59:04.279
<i>You can't trust
anything Miles says.</i>

59:07.081 --> 59:09.849
<i>I couldn't talk
when Miles was here.</i>

59:09.851 --> 59:11.684
<i>During our session,
there was a struggle,</i>

59:11.686 --> 59:13.220
<i>but I think your son heard me.</i>

59:13.222 --> 59:15.288
<i>It just took a moment
to figure it out.</i>

59:15.290 --> 59:19.925
<i>He scratched what I realized
was a message, the name.</i>

59:19.927 --> 59:22.129
<i>He gave me the name, Sarah.</i>

59:22.131 --> 59:25.031
<i>Type "Edward Scarka"
into your computer.</i>

59:25.033 --> 59:28.937
<i>S-C-A-R-K-A.</i>

59:31.974 --> 59:33.739
The Thrush Creek Killer.

59:33.741 --> 59:36.278
<i>That's him. Look at the eyes.</i>

59:38.480 --> 59:41.948
They're two different colors,
just like Miles.

59:41.950 --> 59:43.583
<i>When's Miles' birthday?</i>

59:43.585 --> 59:45.718
August 22nd, 2010.

59:45.720 --> 59:48.390
<i>That's the day Edward Scarka
was killed in a police raid.</i>

59:49.558 --> 59:51.393
<i>He died just after 4:00 a.m.</i>

59:52.327 --> 59:56.163
Miles was born at 4:15 a.m.

59:56.165 --> 59:59.599
<i>He killed nine women
over a span of five years.</i>

59:59.601 --> 01:00:01.501
<i>The last victim,
the tenth one,</i>

01:00:01.503 --> 01:00:04.271
<i>managed to get away, but not
before he cut off her hand.</i>

01:00:04.273 --> 01:00:06.239
<i>They all had
their hands removed.</i>

01:00:06.241 --> 01:00:07.575
<i>That was his trademark.</i>

01:00:07.577 --> 01:00:09.809
<i>He would cut off their hands,
then kill them.</i>

01:00:09.811 --> 01:00:12.412
<i>Cut off their hands,
then kill them.</i>

01:00:12.414 --> 01:00:13.747
<i>The survivor,</i>

01:00:13.749 --> 01:00:16.783
<i>Margaret St. James,
wrote a book about her ordeal.</i>

01:00:16.785 --> 01:00:20.189
<i>She led the police to him,
where they gunned him down.</i>

01:00:21.089 --> 01:00:22.492
So now we know.

01:00:23.526 --> 01:00:24.925
Right?

01:00:24.927 --> 01:00:28.295
<i>Yes, but we still need to know
the reason why he's come back.</i>

01:00:28.297 --> 01:00:29.664
<i>What Scarka wants.</i>

01:00:29.666 --> 01:00:31.932
<i>That's what
will free your son.</i>

01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:37.206
Wait.

01:01:12.375 --> 01:01:14.177
Arthur, I have to go now.

01:01:15.744 --> 01:01:16.911
John.

01:01:16.913 --> 01:01:17.981
What's going on?

01:01:25.355 --> 01:01:27.724
We have to do something
about Miles.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:33.327
We have to do something
about Miles right away.

01:01:33.329 --> 01:01:35.431
But he absolutely cannot know.

01:02:17.741 --> 01:02:19.042
Wait an hour.

01:02:20.977 --> 01:02:23.547
I'll pack some of his clothes
and meet you there.

01:02:40.297 --> 01:02:43.233
Is there another fraction
that is equal to two-eighths?

01:02:44.168 --> 01:02:45.902
So can we simplify to...

01:02:47.071 --> 01:02:49.638
Mr. Blume. Is everything okay?

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.674
Uh, yeah. I'm here
to pick up Miles.

01:02:52.676 --> 01:02:53.841
Well, we're almost
finished our lesson,

01:02:53.843 --> 01:02:55.277
I can bring him out
in just a second.

01:02:55.279 --> 01:02:57.612
No, I'm sorry,
we gotta go now.

01:02:57.614 --> 01:02:59.450
It's a family emergency.

01:03:00.918 --> 01:03:03.786
Right. Do you need to sign out
in the office?

01:03:03.788 --> 01:03:05.987
No, Sarah just called over.

01:03:05.989 --> 01:03:07.257
Spoke with them.

01:03:08.625 --> 01:03:10.559
Hey, Miles, come on.

01:03:10.561 --> 01:03:11.796
Let's go.

01:03:18.001 --> 01:03:19.269
Miles?

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:25.943
Let's go, buddy.

01:03:29.179 --> 01:03:30.548
Miles!

01:04:42.922 --> 01:04:44.355
Oh, my God.

01:05:06.077 --> 01:05:07.947
He came back for you.

01:05:11.917 --> 01:05:13.886
He wants you dead.

01:05:24.797 --> 01:05:27.232
Miles, your mother and I
had to make a decision.

01:05:30.336 --> 01:05:32.638
You're gonna go and live
somewhere for a while.

01:05:34.507 --> 01:05:35.508
And, uh...

01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:38.475
The place where we're going

01:05:38.477 --> 01:05:40.412
has people who can help you
get better.

01:05:41.947 --> 01:05:43.415
Really good doctors.

01:05:46.585 --> 01:05:48.919
It's gonna be tough
for a while, but I think

01:05:48.921 --> 01:05:50.654
as you get older,
you'll understand

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:52.356
that sometimes...

01:05:52.358 --> 01:05:53.524
Sometimes what's best for us

01:05:53.526 --> 01:05:55.427
is the hardest thing
for us to do.

01:06:01.467 --> 01:06:04.169
We just want you to know
that we love you very much.

01:06:05.804 --> 01:06:07.007
More than anything
in the world.

01:06:11.877 --> 01:06:12.977
Miles...

01:06:12.979 --> 01:06:13.980
Miles!

01:06:53.152 --> 01:06:56.153
He's fighting
very hard right now.

01:06:56.155 --> 01:06:57.889
We'll have to
keep him unconscious

01:06:57.891 --> 01:06:59.424
for three or four weeks.

01:06:59.426 --> 01:07:01.059
When the swelling
in his brain goes down,

01:07:01.061 --> 01:07:03.262
we'll determine
the extent of his injury.

01:07:04.731 --> 01:07:06.231
Your husband's strong.

01:07:08.602 --> 01:07:10.403
What he needs is time.

01:07:13.272 --> 01:07:14.774
Where is my son?

01:07:17.577 --> 01:07:18.845
He's across the hall.

01:07:29.522 --> 01:07:30.724
I'm so sorry.

01:07:40.101 --> 01:07:41.401
I love you.

01:07:46.406 --> 01:07:48.274
I love you. I'm so sorry.

01:07:49.977 --> 01:07:51.711
I'm so sorry.

01:08:08.261 --> 01:08:10.831
I think I know
how to stop this.

01:08:14.802 --> 01:08:16.804
I think I can save him.

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.675
If I do this,

01:08:22.274 --> 01:08:23.611
maybe...

01:08:27.014 --> 01:08:29.984
Maybe we could all be
back together again.

01:08:41.996 --> 01:08:43.497
I'll leave you two alone.

01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:11.959
Miles, what happened
in the car?

01:09:13.161 --> 01:09:15.560
I don't know.

01:09:15.563 --> 01:09:18.032
I don't remember anything.

01:09:27.707 --> 01:09:29.542
I know how I can help you.

01:09:33.014 --> 01:09:34.749
But I need you to trust me.

01:09:37.752 --> 01:09:40.087
I need you to trust me,
whatever I do.

01:09:42.157 --> 01:09:43.557
Can you do that?

01:10:44.287 --> 01:10:45.952
Do you remember those pills

01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:48.257
I gave you so you didn't
get car sick?

01:10:49.391 --> 01:10:51.459
You remember
how it made you sleepy?

01:10:52.228 --> 01:10:53.229
Yeah.

01:10:59.367 --> 01:11:01.103
I need you to sleep.

01:11:02.138 --> 01:11:04.539
But why?

01:11:05.907 --> 01:11:08.808
Because I can't trust you

01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:10.910
until you're all better.

01:11:10.912 --> 01:11:13.182
I want to see you
take it, Miles.

01:11:26.262 --> 01:11:28.030
Where are we going?

01:11:31.133 --> 01:11:32.835
Shut your eyes.

01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:04.531
I'm gonna take care
of what you came back for.

01:14:00.318 --> 01:14:02.150
Can I help you?

01:14:02.152 --> 01:14:03.954
Are you Margaret St. James?

01:14:05.655 --> 01:14:06.923
What do you want?

01:14:08.025 --> 01:14:09.993
My name is Sarah Blume.

01:14:11.496 --> 01:14:14.998
I recently had an experience,
and your book, it...

01:14:16.833 --> 01:14:18.202
It helped me.

01:14:20.771 --> 01:14:23.707
I was wondering
if you had a moment.

01:14:26.511 --> 01:14:29.313
I have a rule of not
seeing people in my home.

01:14:30.814 --> 01:14:33.015
Just five minutes.

01:14:33.017 --> 01:14:35.819
Please?
I have nowhere else to go.

01:14:46.297 --> 01:14:48.064
I'll make some tea.

01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:49.801
You can grab a seat.

01:14:59.877 --> 01:15:02.044
Oh, Pickles, you're just gonna
wanna come back inside

01:15:02.046 --> 01:15:04.346
as soon as you see
how cold it is.

01:15:04.348 --> 01:15:05.883
Yeah, okay.

01:15:06.918 --> 01:15:09.020
Here you go. Go on.

01:15:21.099 --> 01:15:22.166
Peppermint or lemon?

01:15:24.035 --> 01:15:25.571
Either one.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:07.546
This thing's not pretty,

01:16:08.779 --> 01:16:10.781
but it can tear
a piece of toilet paper.

01:16:12.384 --> 01:16:13.919
I'm so sorry.

01:16:16.321 --> 01:16:19.525
Was it recent,
what happened to you?

01:16:21.759 --> 01:16:23.795
It's been going on
for a while.

01:16:25.063 --> 01:16:26.365
It's my son.

01:16:29.968 --> 01:16:31.401
This is about your son?

01:16:31.403 --> 01:16:33.172
Mmm. Yes, Miles.

01:16:35.107 --> 01:16:36.408
How old is he?

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.245
He's eight.

01:16:42.147 --> 01:16:43.982
That's a wonderful age.

01:16:45.484 --> 01:16:48.687
My David was so sweet
at that age.

01:16:50.122 --> 01:16:51.924
I didn't know
that you had children.

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:57.528
I've made a choice
to keep my family private.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:01.166
David's father and I got
divorced before I met Scarka.

01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:06.169
But I didn't feel it was fair
to link them

01:17:06.171 --> 01:17:08.173
to all that pain and hate.

01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:13.479
Where is your son now?

01:17:14.813 --> 01:17:18.016
Starting sophomore year
at Michigan State.

01:17:19.652 --> 01:17:22.821
And from what I hear,
he has a new girlfriend, too.

01:17:28.927 --> 01:17:30.230
It's okay.

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:32.663
You'll get through this.

01:17:32.665 --> 01:17:34.334
I shouldn't have come here.

01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:40.837
May I use your restroom?

01:17:40.839 --> 01:17:42.475
Yeah, it's just down the hall.

01:17:45.811 --> 01:17:47.877
I'll make you that cup of tea.

01:18:08.301 --> 01:18:09.569
I'm sorry.

01:18:10.738 --> 01:18:12.038
I'm so sorry.

01:18:49.242 --> 01:18:50.444
Pickles.

01:18:51.545 --> 01:18:53.412
How'd you get back inside?

01:18:59.653 --> 01:19:01.120
What are you doing?

01:19:02.623 --> 01:19:04.458
What are you doing? Stop.

01:19:05.426 --> 01:19:06.593
Stop.

01:19:08.462 --> 01:19:09.996
Please don't...

01:19:13.467 --> 01:19:14.802
No.

01:19:17.137 --> 01:19:18.472
I can't.

01:19:21.475 --> 01:19:23.442
I can't.

01:19:23.444 --> 01:19:25.677
I'm so sorry.

01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:26.680
Hey!

01:19:29.516 --> 01:19:31.085
Which one you like better?

01:19:32.486 --> 01:19:33.654
Blue

01:19:34.488 --> 01:19:35.823
or hazel?

01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:38.023
Blue

01:19:38.025 --> 01:19:39.293
or hazel?

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.426
Blue

01:19:41.428 --> 01:19:42.661
or hazel?

01:19:42.663 --> 01:19:43.931
How do you...

01:19:45.666 --> 01:19:47.534
That's what he said
the night I met him.

01:19:52.707 --> 01:19:53.708
Miles!

01:19:56.477 --> 01:19:58.543
No, don't!

01:19:58.545 --> 01:20:00.479
Miles, no!

01:20:04.952 --> 01:20:06.453
No.

01:20:21.368 --> 01:20:23.503
You should never have left me,

01:20:23.505 --> 01:20:24.905
Margaret.

01:21:31.272 --> 01:21:32.574
Miles!

01:21:38.914 --> 01:21:40.783
Miles, it's over!

01:21:45.386 --> 01:21:47.288
Miles!

01:21:51.727 --> 01:21:52.928
Miles!

01:21:55.997 --> 01:21:57.631
Miles!

01:22:02.905 --> 01:22:04.005
Miles!

01:22:16.352 --> 01:22:17.651
Miles.

01:22:23.459 --> 01:22:24.894
Baby...

01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:32.468
Miles...

01:22:37.773 --> 01:22:39.308
It's too late.

01:22:54.156 --> 01:22:55.959
You got what you came for.

01:22:58.727 --> 01:23:01.295
Let me have my son.

01:23:01.297 --> 01:23:04.700
You still believe
Miles is alive?

01:23:06.970 --> 01:23:09.703
Did he sound like this?

01:23:09.705 --> 01:23:11.206
Mommy?

01:23:13.475 --> 01:23:16.343
Will you always love me

01:23:16.345 --> 01:23:18.213
no matter what I do?

01:23:19.883 --> 01:23:22.082
You were easy.

01:23:22.084 --> 01:23:24.988
I knew you would
bring me to her.

01:23:26.221 --> 01:23:27.857
How long has he been gone?

01:23:30.026 --> 01:23:32.860
The night you promised
you would always love him...

01:23:34.096 --> 01:23:36.700
...that was the last time
he ever spoke to you.

01:23:39.201 --> 01:23:40.570
He's gone now.

01:23:41.738 --> 01:23:43.006
You

01:23:44.608 --> 01:23:47.744
are a monster.

01:23:48.578 --> 01:23:50.878
You took my son's soul?

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:53.081
You will not...

01:23:56.052 --> 01:23:57.887
You cannot have his body!

01:24:26.416 --> 01:24:27.617
Jesus!

01:24:46.436 --> 01:24:48.806
She was trying to kill me.
