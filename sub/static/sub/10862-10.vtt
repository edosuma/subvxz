00:34.000 --> 00:36.080
Let's give them
a few more minutes.

00:38.520 --> 00:39.440
[Rustling]

00:39.440 --> 00:41.800
I think
that's them now.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.920
Sorry we're late.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.000
Hey, I heard about your bike
getting stolen. You OK?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.080
Yeah, well,
what can you do?

00:51.080 --> 00:53.120
How can anyone
steal a bike?

00:53.120 --> 00:55.840
Yeah. It's like ripping
off a part of somebody.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.440
I thought about that.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.440
It really ticked me off

01:01.440 --> 01:04.840
that someone could take something
that was so important to me.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.160
'Cause once you have
the right bike,

01:08.160 --> 01:09.880
it's yours forever,

01:09.880 --> 01:11.840
no matter who has it.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.880
But it's not
a total loss.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.880
David came up
with a story about it.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.400
It's about this kid...

01:20.400 --> 01:22.400
and his bike,

01:22.400 --> 01:25.400
a bike that meant
so much to him

01:25.400 --> 01:27.880
that he took it
everywhere he went,

01:27.880 --> 01:30.040
including... his own grave.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.880
Submitted for the approval

01:35.880 --> 01:37.880
of the Midnight Society,

01:37.880 --> 01:41.440
I call this story...

01:51.080 --> 01:52.760
I'm gonna
beat you!

01:52.760 --> 01:54.120
No, I will!

01:56.320 --> 01:57.240
Come on!

01:57.240 --> 01:58.800
I got it!

02:00.680 --> 02:03.040
[Excited yelling]

02:06.360 --> 02:07.600
Whoo!

02:09.880 --> 02:11.200
Whoo!

02:35.560 --> 02:37.120
Whoo!
Whoo!

02:45.880 --> 02:47.400
I won!

02:49.760 --> 02:51.880
That'll teach you not
to mess with the best.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.800
Like you weren't the
luckiest guy in the world?

02:55.800 --> 02:56.880
Whoa!
Whoa!

03:00.680 --> 03:02.360
Just a couple more
weeks. I'm psyched!

03:02.360 --> 03:04.240
My dad's taking
apart my reel

03:04.240 --> 03:06.360
and cleaning it
this weekend!

03:06.360 --> 03:08.880
Maybe this year Uncle
Chad'll catch a bass.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.880
Yeah. Maybe he'll learn how to
bait your hook, not your finger.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.320
Mike!

03:18.040 --> 03:20.960
I got you!
Hold on, Ricky!

03:20.960 --> 03:22.720
I can't!

03:22.720 --> 03:24.680
Yes, you can!
You can!

03:26.960 --> 03:28.120
No!

03:28.120 --> 03:29.680
Ricky!

03:30.840 --> 03:32.280
Mike?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.280
You OK?

03:34.280 --> 03:36.480
Yeah. I'm all right.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.280
You were having
another bad dream.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.320
[Sighs]

03:43.320 --> 03:45.760
It's OK, Ben.
Go back to sleep.

03:45.760 --> 03:46.760
Honest?

03:46.760 --> 03:47.960
Honest.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.480
Good night, Mike.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.960
Night, kiddo.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.160
Looks like someone's
going to fall asleep

04:16.160 --> 04:17.680
in his corn wackies.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.680
What?

04:18.680 --> 04:20.680
Are you all right,
honey?

04:20.680 --> 04:22.680
Uh--uh, yeah.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.200
Yeah,
I'm all right.

04:24.200 --> 04:27.200
I'm just a little
tired, that's all.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.680
Trouble sleeping?

04:28.680 --> 04:30.680
No, I'm just--

04:30.680 --> 04:31.680
you know.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.200
He had another
nightmare.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.200
Not another one.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.680
Oh, Mike.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.680
You guys say that like I
can do something about it.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.720
You can stop blaming
yourself for Ricky's death.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.040
I was there.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.680
I had the chance to
save him, and I couldn't.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.680
Honey, you know how much
your father and I loved Ricky.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.680
You have to stop knocking
yourself around over his death.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.680
Stop blaming yourself, and
the nightmares will go away.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.680
Yeah.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.680
[Together]
Keep outta this.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.680
Oh, right. The jets don't
stand a chance this season.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.680
Excuse me? Hello. What about
Sando? The man's the key.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.160
Yeah.
Like last year?

05:05.160 --> 05:07.120
Hey, he was out
half the season.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.720
Yeah, and he'll probably
get beat up again.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.000
Uh, Michael.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.640
What's up, man?

05:29.640 --> 05:31.560
Hey, you OK?

05:35.600 --> 05:38.000
Did you--
did you just see--

05:38.000 --> 05:39.360
What?

05:42.200 --> 05:43.200
Pfft.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.640
Ah, nothing.
Forget it. Let's go.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.920
Let's go.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.280
And so,
with only months to go,

05:50.280 --> 05:52.640
NASA met John F. Kennedy's
challenge

05:52.640 --> 05:57.640
to put men on the moon
before the end of the decade.

05:57.640 --> 06:01.160
The three chosen
for this historic flight...

06:01.160 --> 06:02.440
were

06:02.440 --> 06:04.880
Buzz Aldrin,
Michael Collins,

06:04.880 --> 06:06.040
and--

06:07.560 --> 06:09.200
Mr. Buckley.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.840
Mr. Buckley,
are you with us?

06:13.840 --> 06:16.080
Ground control
to Michael Buckley!

06:16.080 --> 06:17.600
Nabbed.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.600
Paying attention,
are we?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.680
Uh... yes,
Miss Westwood.

06:21.680 --> 06:22.720
Good.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.160
Then maybe you would
tell everybody

06:25.160 --> 06:27.760
what we were
talking about

06:27.760 --> 06:30.840
before I had to stop and
bring you back to earth.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.880
Uh, well, I...
I, uh...

06:32.880 --> 06:34.840
Not quite.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.680
<i>We're not covering I
or uh until next semester.</i>

06:37.680 --> 06:39.080
[Tittering]

06:39.080 --> 06:40.680
Nice try, though.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.120
Now...

06:43.120 --> 06:46.080
Maybe you're having
a bad day.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.560
But I had my in-laws over
for dinner last night,

06:49.560 --> 06:53.640
and, needless to say, I need you
to cut me a little slack. OK?

06:53.640 --> 06:54.400
OK.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.560
Good.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.560
Now, back to the moon.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.560
It was widely believed
that Bobby Kennedy

07:01.560 --> 07:04.880
was going to keep his
brother's policies in check.

07:04.880 --> 07:07.560
[Teacher's voice
fades]

07:07.560 --> 07:08.920
Ricky?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.800
Ricky?

07:11.800 --> 07:12.880
<i> Mike.</i>

07:15.920 --> 07:17.600
<i> Mike.</i>

07:19.920 --> 07:21.000
It's Ricky!

07:21.000 --> 07:23.520
It's Ricky!

07:23.520 --> 07:25.520
Mike, Mike.
You OK?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.520
You OK?

07:28.520 --> 07:30.040
Who's Ricky?

07:30.040 --> 07:31.040
What?

07:31.040 --> 07:32.520
Who is Ricky?

07:32.520 --> 07:35.520
You mentioned the name
Ricky in the classroom.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.040
Miss Westwood says
you kept repeating it.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.040
Why?

07:39.040 --> 07:40.520
He was a friend.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.040
Did you two
have a fight?

07:43.040 --> 07:45.520
Uh... I--I don't--

07:45.520 --> 07:49.040
Put this on the back
of your neck.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.040
<i>You said he was
your friend.</i>

07:51.040 --> 07:52.520
Did you fight?

07:52.520 --> 07:55.040
He was my... friend.
I--

07:55.040 --> 07:56.920
but he's dead.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.520
About 5 years now.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.960
Ricky.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.480
Oh! I'm sorry.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.960
You're talking about
the Hagerty boy.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.480
Leave it on.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.480
You still have a hard
time with his death?

08:10.480 --> 08:11.960
Sometimes.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.560
How so?

08:15.560 --> 08:18.480
Once in a while
I get these dreams.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.000
They're nightmares,
really.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.480
I'm always trying to
save Ricky's life, but...

08:25.480 --> 08:28.400
Just like at the
bridge, I can't.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.480
I keep hoping the next
time I'll be able to,

08:31.480 --> 08:33.480
the next time,
I can help him.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.799
You know, they never
even found his body.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.799
But you know that when the dream
does come out the right way,

08:39.799 --> 08:43.679
it won't change the fact
that your friend is gone.

08:43.679 --> 08:46.000
That's the thing. He's
not gone. I saw him today.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.480
What?

08:47.480 --> 08:49.000
Uh, I mean...

08:49.000 --> 08:51.520
I'm not feeling
too well.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.760
I'm going to let you
go home early today.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.840
I think you don't feel well
because of these nightmares

08:58.840 --> 09:00.240
and lack of sleep.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.480
<i>[Distant voice]
Mike...</i>

09:01.480 --> 09:03.680
Get some rest
this weekend,

09:03.680 --> 09:05.680
and if you don't
feel better by Monday,

09:05.680 --> 09:07.600
have your parents call
your family physician.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.640
<i> Mike...</i>

09:20.200 --> 09:21.480
It's him! It's--

09:25.520 --> 09:27.600
What's going on?

09:37.000 --> 09:37.920
This stinks.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.440
This really stinks,
you know?

09:39.440 --> 09:42.440
Why'd you have to take me
to see Dr. McBride anyway?

09:42.440 --> 09:43.920
Oh, I don't know.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.960
Maybe going into shock
at the nurse's station

09:46.960 --> 09:49.440
and raving about seeing
your dead best friend

09:49.440 --> 09:51.960
might have had
something to do with it.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.960
I've never missed the first day
of fishing season--not once.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.440
Not even the year Ricky...
died.

09:57.440 --> 09:58.960
Mike, I'm sorry.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.960
The doctor said bed rest, and
that's what it's going to be.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.440
You all think
I'm crazy, don't you?

10:04.440 --> 10:06.440
I'm not.
I saw what I saw.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.440
I know you think
you did.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.280
But I also believe
the doctor

10:10.280 --> 10:12.280
when he says that
you should be in bed.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.400
Stop the car!

10:15.880 --> 10:19.280
I--I just saw Ricky riding
his bike down Hanover Road.

10:19.280 --> 10:22.600
Dad, please! This will
prove I'm not crazy.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.240
That's him.

10:52.000 --> 10:52.920
Uh...

10:52.920 --> 10:54.120
Sorry.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.040
That's it. It's
bedtime for you, pal.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.920
Did--didn't you just
think for just a second

11:00.920 --> 11:02.400
that was Ricky?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.280
No, son.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.160
You didn't?

11:08.160 --> 11:09.920
Mike...

11:09.920 --> 11:11.360
Ricky's dead.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.240
Let's go home.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.320
Ruth, please. Enough
with the thermometer.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.320
The poor kid's been poked and
prodded enough for one day.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.320
The doctor says he
just needs some rest.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.320
Aha! I knew it.
99.6.

11:31.320 --> 11:35.200
Good. When he hits
100, we'll sell.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.400
I don't get it.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.080
It's a joke
about stocks, Ben.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.080
I'm gonna go
get a movie.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.600
Can we get you
anything?

11:41.600 --> 11:44.200
No, we're all right,
Dad. Thanks.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.680
Let's go, kiddo.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.280
Can I stay
a little while?

11:47.280 --> 11:48.880
Your brother
needs his rest.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.240
It's OK. He'll only
be here a little while.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.440
Please?

11:53.640 --> 11:55.000
All right.
But the minute

11:55.000 --> 11:57.560
Mike starts nodding off,
you hit the road.

11:57.560 --> 11:58.680
Thanks.

11:58.680 --> 11:59.880
All right.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.320
I'm really gonna miss you
not going fishing tomorrow.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.680
I wish you can go.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.400
Yeah, me, too.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.440
I've never been to
the river without you.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.920
Hey, no sweat.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.280
I was going there
when I was 10.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.040
Besides, you'll have your
friends there. It'll be cool.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.520
Just like you used to
go with Ricky.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.760
Yeah.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.000
Mike...

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Did you really
see him?

12:29.640 --> 12:31.280
I swear I did, Ben.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.160
Everyone thinks I'm a few
sandwiches short of a picnic.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.600
I believe you.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.600
Thanks.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.120
If everyone did,

12:38.120 --> 12:41.120
I wouldn't be stuck in
bed all stinking weekend.

12:41.120 --> 12:41.840
Hey...

12:43.400 --> 12:45.520
I'll tell you what.

12:45.520 --> 12:48.400
Mom and Dad are going grocery
shopping Saturday, right?

12:48.400 --> 12:51.160
Before they leave, wake
me. I'll go with you.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.360
You will?

12:52.360 --> 12:54.280
Sure. It's not like
I'm really sick, right?

12:54.280 --> 12:55.600
Cool!

12:55.600 --> 12:58.120
So what did Dad's
joke before mean?

12:58.120 --> 13:00.280
Was it dirty?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.280
No. It was just
too grownup

13:02.280 --> 13:03.840
for you to
understand, Ben.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.840
Besides, it wasn't that
funny. Yours are much better.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.920
Wanna hear one?

13:08.920 --> 13:10.280
Hit me, brother.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.040
Ask me why I'm
a great comedian.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.520
Why are you a great--
Timing!

13:36.240 --> 13:37.360
Ben?

13:46.520 --> 13:48.360
<i> Mike...</i>

14:13.280 --> 14:14.720
Hey!

14:14.720 --> 14:17.200
Where do you
think you're going?

14:17.200 --> 14:18.600
Uh, well...

14:18.600 --> 14:21.640
Well, I need my...

14:21.640 --> 14:23.160
Tackle box. Yeah.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.160
Yeah. My tackle box.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.160
You know it's
in the garage.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.640
Has everyone here
gone wacky?

14:28.640 --> 14:30.160
Go get your stuff.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.160
Mom and I'll give you a
ride to gower's river.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.960
Um... that's all
right, Dad. I'll walk.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.320
Don't be ridiculous.
It's a long hike.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.200
[Sadly]
OK.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.640
Good!

14:40.640 --> 14:43.640
And don't sound so
excited about it.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.120
[Tap]

15:05.880 --> 15:07.080
[Tap tap]

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
[Tap]

15:13.560 --> 15:14.720
[Tap tap]

15:26.160 --> 15:27.960
Father:
Hop in, Ben.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.000
<i> Mike...</i>

15:51.640 --> 15:54.560
<i> Mike! Mike!</i>

15:54.560 --> 15:56.520
<i> It's Ricky. Come on!</i>

16:14.160 --> 16:15.920
<i> Mike...</i>

16:15.920 --> 16:17.640
<i> Come out!</i>

16:24.040 --> 16:26.400
OK. Fine.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.920
He wants me,

16:27.920 --> 16:29.440
let me get it
over with.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.120
I'm sick of this.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.680
Isn't that where your
brother's friend got killed?

16:41.680 --> 16:43.520
Keep moving.

16:43.520 --> 16:46.080
I don't want to hear
any more about Ricky.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
Ricky?

16:59.120 --> 17:00.120
Ricky!

17:03.480 --> 17:04.599
Ricky!!!

17:08.119 --> 17:09.520
Ricky?

17:11.599 --> 17:13.359
Here I am, Mike.

17:18.599 --> 17:21.040
"H-here I am?"

17:21.040 --> 17:23.000
J-just like that?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.720
"Here I am."

17:24.720 --> 17:26.200
What do you
want from me?

17:29.560 --> 17:31.920
You're cold.

17:36.920 --> 17:37.840
Hey!

17:37.840 --> 17:40.480
Sorry. It was
an accident.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.560
Yeah.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.920
What did you
do that for?

17:47.920 --> 17:50.160
Sorry.
Another "accident."

18:02.080 --> 18:03.880
Look, I--

18:03.880 --> 18:07.040
Ricky, I tried
to save you, all right?

18:07.040 --> 18:08.480
I did whatever I could.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.960
If that wasn't
good enough,

18:09.960 --> 18:11.560
do whatever
you want to me.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.680
I'm not here
to hurt you, Mike.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.600
You're my best friend.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.520
You tried
to save my life.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.160
Why do you keep
coming after me?

18:20.160 --> 18:21.680
I'm here to warn you.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.360
Warn me?

18:23.360 --> 18:24.960
<i>That's great.
Warn me.</i>

18:24.960 --> 18:26.480
You know,
what's so important

18:26.480 --> 18:28.960
that you have
to come up here--

18:28.960 --> 18:30.000
It's Ben.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.520
What?

18:43.240 --> 18:45.080
He's in danger, Mike.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.240
I tried to tell you
yesterday at school.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.480
You must go to him
before it's too late.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.280
He's at the bridge.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.200
My bridge.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.400
Thanks.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.960
I miss you, Ricky.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.000
I miss you too, Mike.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.440
Get going.

19:22.440 --> 19:23.920
It's a long ride,

19:23.920 --> 19:27.000
and we don't want Ben
on this side just yet.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.440
Guys!

19:38.440 --> 19:39.520
Hey, guys!

20:16.920 --> 20:18.800
Guys! Help!

20:39.520 --> 20:41.080
Help!

20:41.080 --> 20:42.200
Ben!

20:45.920 --> 20:47.440
Ben!

20:53.400 --> 20:56.320
<i> I've got you! Hold
on, Ricky! Hold on!</i>

20:56.320 --> 20:57.840
<i> I can't!</i>

20:57.840 --> 21:00.000
<i> Yes, you can!
You can!</i>

21:01.040 --> 21:02.400
<i> No!</i>

21:02.400 --> 21:03.600
<i> Ricky!</i>

21:10.240 --> 21:11.360
Ben: Help!

21:11.360 --> 21:12.600
Ben.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.840
I'm down here, Mike!

21:17.840 --> 21:19.200
Hurry!

21:22.720 --> 21:23.640
Hurry, Mike!

21:23.640 --> 21:25.320
Careful!

21:25.320 --> 21:27.360
Mike:
Come on. Hang on.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.000
Let's go!

21:42.400 --> 21:44.800
Be careful.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.160
Ow. Ow.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.320
Let me see.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.720
Ow...

21:48.720 --> 21:50.360
I can't tell if it's
a break or a sprain,

21:50.360 --> 21:52.920
but you'll have
to see the doctor.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.800
It's all right.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.400
You're all right,
man. You'll make it.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.320
Thanks, Mike.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.840
No sweat.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.120
Come on.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.280
Let's go.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.080
The very next day,
a man who was fishing

22:29.080 --> 22:31.280
found the remains
of Ricky Hagerty.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.560
Why had it taken
so many years to find him?

22:34.560 --> 22:36.240
Mike Buckley
will tell you

22:36.240 --> 22:40.080
that it's because
he wasn't even down there...

22:40.080 --> 22:42.280
Not at least until
he had paid back a favor

22:42.280 --> 22:44.120
to an old friend.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.720
I declare this meeting
of the Midnight Society

22:54.720 --> 22:56.520
closed...

22:58.320 --> 23:00.480
Until next time.
