WEBVTT

00:00.873 --> 00:02.771
<i>Previously on The Borgias...</i>

00:02.872 --> 00:05.573
You will choose a bride in Spain

00:05.640 --> 00:07.638
<i>and you will become the Borgia</i>

00:07.705 --> 00:10.609
<i>I always hoped you would be.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:14.484
I propose we use the weapon
the Borgia family uses.

00:14.551 --> 00:15.687
Canterella.

00:15.788 --> 00:17.989
Too much and it will kill you.

00:18.057 --> 00:20.328
Just enough, and it
will make you strong.

00:22.100 --> 00:25.371
Dedicate yourself to
the renewal of Christendom.

00:25.439 --> 00:28.909
To the destruction of
the red whore of Rome!

00:28.976 --> 00:30.545
<i>There is a new</i>
<i>order in Florence.</i>

00:30.613 --> 00:32.613
Savonarola virtually
controls the city.

00:32.682 --> 00:34.251
He must be silenced.

00:34.319 --> 00:37.219
We would have Catherina
Sforza come to Rome

00:37.287 --> 00:39.387
and kneel at our feet.

00:39.455 --> 00:41.055
The pope would
request your presence

00:41.156 --> 00:42.490
at the chair of St. Peter's.

00:42.558 --> 00:44.424
Whom does your mother
bow to, my son?

00:44.492 --> 00:45.626
Nobody.

00:45.727 --> 00:47.160
You refuse to come to Rome?

00:47.228 --> 00:48.895
<i>She shared her bed with me.</i>

00:48.962 --> 00:50.763
Did she beg to be
friends with us?

00:50.831 --> 00:52.566
No, she remains an enemy.

00:52.634 --> 00:54.170
Release me from my
cardinal's robes,

00:54.238 --> 00:55.638
give me the papal army,

00:55.706 --> 00:57.441
and I will bring you
Catherina Sforza in chains!

00:57.508 --> 00:59.811
I will not marry.

00:59.878 --> 01:01.379
Never again.

01:01.447 --> 01:03.617
It is a daughter's duty to
marry her father's choice!

01:03.684 --> 01:05.953
So I am to have no
voice in the matter!

01:06.021 --> 01:08.956
Like me, you have
just declared a war.

01:09.024 --> 01:10.426
<i>Which one is the suitor?</i>

01:10.493 --> 01:12.261
<i>Calvino Pallavicini</i>
<i>from Genova.</i>

01:12.362 --> 01:14.263
And, behind him,
in the brown and grey.

01:14.364 --> 01:15.732
Who is he?

01:15.799 --> 01:17.968
<i>His brother, Raffaello.</i>

01:18.036 --> 01:20.905
Your brother's coming home
with a party of conquistadors.

01:21.006 --> 01:22.508
You must embrace him for me-

01:22.576 --> 01:25.878
while I attend to the
Church's business-

01:25.946 --> 01:27.548
back in Florence.

The most respected
Duke of Gandia, Juan Borgia!

03:46.092 --> 03:48.293
Holy Father.
My son.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.664
A gift.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.306
What is that?

04:00.942 --> 04:03.344
This, dear sister,

04:03.412 --> 04:05.647
is a gift for
you like no other.

04:05.714 --> 04:07.382
For me?

04:09.218 --> 04:12.320
It is called a panther.

04:12.421 --> 04:14.589
Are such beasts common
in Spain?

04:14.657 --> 04:16.091
Not anymore.

04:16.159 --> 04:18.493
Oh!

04:19.862 --> 04:21.762
Take the baby.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.232
Um, and who is this?

04:24.300 --> 04:28.203
May I present
Don Hernando de Caballos.

04:28.270 --> 04:29.938
Ah.

04:30.005 --> 04:32.107
Don Hernando is a
true conquistador.

04:32.174 --> 04:33.274
He has travelled
to the New World

04:33.342 --> 04:34.776
where he brought
the word of God

04:34.877 --> 04:36.077
to the heathen
he found there.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.513
He was also at
the Siege of Granada

04:37.580 --> 04:39.181
where they
defeated the Moor.

04:39.249 --> 04:42.418
Good.
We had a siege in mind.

04:42.519 --> 04:44.420
Hmm.
Holiness.

04:44.487 --> 04:49.124
So, now to our gift.

04:49.192 --> 04:50.659
Mmm.

04:50.727 --> 04:52.594
What have we here?

04:57.667 --> 05:00.235
Turds?

05:00.303 --> 05:02.037
You travel all the way
to our ancestral homeland

05:02.138 --> 05:03.605
and back again

05:03.706 --> 05:06.041
to bring us turds?

05:06.142 --> 05:08.109
Smell them.

05:08.177 --> 05:09.878
Why should we smell a turd?

05:11.446 --> 05:13.481
They are called cigarros.

05:13.548 --> 05:15.683
They are an exotic creation
from the New World.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.785
I will happily demonstrate
at your Holiness's leisure.

05:18.886 --> 05:22.055
Ow!

05:22.156 --> 05:24.257
It bit me!

05:24.357 --> 05:26.525
It could have
eaten my hand!

05:39.205 --> 05:41.607
Give up your vanities!

05:41.674 --> 05:43.476
They're here!
Quick! Hide your valuables!

05:43.543 --> 05:46.245
Get inside.
I told you! Come quickly!

05:46.313 --> 05:47.646
Come along!

05:55.923 --> 05:57.623
Give up your gold!

05:59.159 --> 06:01.994
Your Eminence.
Come.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.429
<i>Save yourselves!</i>

06:03.530 --> 06:04.797
Bring it out!
Bring it out!

06:06.567 --> 06:09.702
What is this,
Signore Machiavelli?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.704
God's children.

06:11.771 --> 06:14.073
Savonarola's vermin.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.342
I feel a sudden chill.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.551
Give up your vanities!

06:25.652 --> 06:27.253
Hell is eternal!

06:27.321 --> 06:31.924
So, we take a turd in our hand.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.492
Cigarro.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.829
Yes, cigarro.
Then what?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.964
You put it in your mouth.

06:42.469 --> 06:45.471
What?
All of it?

06:45.538 --> 06:48.808
No, just the end.
In between the lips.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.179
Now, we take a burning taper.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.848
And so carefully,

06:54.916 --> 06:57.284
as not to cause damage
to the holy person,

06:57.352 --> 07:00.453
we apply fire to the
end of the cigarro.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.522
And, here for the
most important part,

07:02.590 --> 07:04.558
a sensation of
great pleasure.

07:04.659 --> 07:06.527
Pleasure?

07:06.595 --> 07:09.296
I didn't know this
was a leisure pursuit.

07:09.364 --> 07:11.899
We thought it was medicinal.

07:11.967 --> 07:14.435
Please.

07:15.737 --> 07:21.475
Fire, and now suck as
if drawing air through a tube...

07:21.576 --> 07:23.110
a little harder.

07:29.584 --> 07:30.584
Ah!
We are on fire!

07:30.685 --> 07:32.219
One more time.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.290
What is this called?

07:36.357 --> 07:37.724
Smoking!

07:39.160 --> 07:42.395
Smoking?
Indeed, well, one is smoking.

07:45.099 --> 07:46.666
Thank you...

07:46.767 --> 07:48.735
Thank you.

07:56.543 --> 07:57.843
My wife-

07:57.911 --> 08:01.847
Maria Enriquez de Luna.

08:01.914 --> 08:03.482
A rare beauty.

08:03.549 --> 08:06.918
I am devoted to her,
body and soul.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.857
She is with my child.

08:14.293 --> 08:16.828
Bravo!

08:16.896 --> 08:18.830
The bull has done
his work.

08:18.898 --> 08:21.499
An heir.

08:21.601 --> 08:24.402
This pleases us.

08:24.470 --> 08:28.105
It will be a boy.
I can feel it - here.

08:28.173 --> 08:30.675
You have grown into
manhood, my son.

08:30.742 --> 08:33.043
As we prayed for.

08:35.481 --> 08:38.683
We feel a little,
how do I say?

08:38.751 --> 08:40.150
Nauseous.

08:40.251 --> 08:41.219
Exactly.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.321
It will pass.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.798
Wine?

08:52.866 --> 08:56.434
Um, no.
I only drink water.

08:56.502 --> 08:59.036
The clarity of water
gives clarity of mind.

08:59.104 --> 09:00.838
Oh.

09:00.905 --> 09:03.840
A blessing.

09:03.908 --> 09:08.245
We are of a similar
temperament.

09:10.548 --> 09:12.049
So-to business.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.684
Catherina Sforza.

09:13.785 --> 09:17.121
The bitch of Forli.
Is she still in this world?

09:17.189 --> 09:19.057
In this world and
threatening war.

09:19.124 --> 09:22.394
The papal army
awaits your command.

09:22.462 --> 09:25.831
Lay siege to her castle,

09:25.899 --> 09:29.535
give her occasion to
come to the Holy City,

09:29.636 --> 09:32.705
to bend her knee to Rome.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.340
Should she refuse

09:34.408 --> 09:37.242
then you are at liberty
to seize her estates.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.312
Her land, her titles,
her deeds, the castle at Forli,

09:40.379 --> 09:43.514
will be yours, a rich reward.

09:43.615 --> 09:45.449
And if she refuses?

09:48.386 --> 09:51.988
Then knock the bitch
off her perch.

09:57.529 --> 10:03.068
By the grace of God,
Father, I am ready.

10:33.164 --> 10:34.398
Thank you, Brother.

10:34.466 --> 10:36.500
Heard the news from
Florence, Brother?

10:36.568 --> 10:38.435
Our blessed
Brother Savanorola

10:38.503 --> 10:40.971
is making it
a true city of God.

10:41.039 --> 10:42.673
He should take care then.

10:42.741 --> 10:45.109
Borgia spies take note
of his every word,

10:45.177 --> 10:48.679
Machiavelli chief among them.
Thank you.

10:48.747 --> 10:51.248
Any hint of heresy is
music to their ears.

10:51.315 --> 10:52.783
Praise to God.

10:52.850 --> 10:55.252
Is it heresy, then, to declare
the rule of the blessed?

10:55.320 --> 10:58.889
To ban usury and sodomy?

10:58.957 --> 11:01.525
We know all the
Borgia wiles, Brother.

11:01.593 --> 11:04.228
If Savanarola claims to speak
with the tongue of angels,

11:04.296 --> 11:07.998
they have the excuse they
need for a public burning.

11:08.066 --> 11:09.566
He must beware.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.735
Temper his words.

11:12.904 --> 11:16.006
The friar speaks from the heart.

11:16.074 --> 11:19.043
His power is his rhetoric.

11:19.110 --> 11:22.079
His words will
never be tempered.

11:22.147 --> 11:23.747
We need his presence
here on earth,

11:23.815 --> 11:25.449
not in heaven, Brother.

11:25.517 --> 11:28.652
We already have one among
us who would be a martyr.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.288
Then we must let the friar know

11:30.355 --> 11:32.957
that we are within
in sight of our goal.

11:33.025 --> 11:37.829
Our prayer: a world
without the Borgia pope.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.208
Holy Father?

11:50.309 --> 11:51.543
Ah!

11:51.610 --> 11:53.578
I would meet with the
suitor from Genova.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.013
Calvino Pallavicini?

11:55.081 --> 11:56.715
I would meet with him-

11:56.782 --> 11:58.650
if just to determine
the colour of his eyes.

11:58.717 --> 11:59.750
Nothing more.

11:59.818 --> 12:01.786
Oh.
Your hand?

12:01.854 --> 12:04.655
Ah.
Such elegance, yes?

12:04.756 --> 12:06.557
My thanks to my brother.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.260
Had he gifted me a viper,
I would now be in my shroud.

12:09.327 --> 12:11.896
Your brother shows sense.
He has married well.

12:11.964 --> 12:15.032
We would advise you to
follow the same path.

12:16.201 --> 12:17.935
What is that in your mouth?

12:19.804 --> 12:21.205
It's a cigarro.

12:21.273 --> 12:22.774
Hm.

12:22.841 --> 12:24.742
Not a turd?

12:24.810 --> 12:26.044
No!

12:26.111 --> 12:27.579
It smells like one.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.516
Hm.
Ah!

12:33.752 --> 12:35.587
Not good.

12:35.654 --> 12:38.122
In fact, very bad.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.557
Is it true that the disease

12:39.625 --> 12:41.259
can eat its way to the
brain and destroy it?

12:41.326 --> 12:44.928
It is lust that destroys
the brain, not the disease.

12:44.996 --> 12:47.197
<i>The damage has</i>
<i>already been done</i>

12:47.265 --> 12:50.500
before the disease
takes hold. Hm...

12:50.568 --> 12:51.868
Ah.

12:51.936 --> 12:55.506
Mercury-or rather,
the corrosive sublimate-

12:55.574 --> 12:57.475
is indicated.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.344
To be taken in minute
portions, mind,

12:59.412 --> 13:01.346
<i>or it will kill.</i>

13:03.316 --> 13:08.321
Your salvation may lie in
this, uh, modest instrument.

13:08.422 --> 13:11.124
Allow me to demonstrate.

13:11.192 --> 13:14.694
This is inserted into
the privy member.

13:14.762 --> 13:16.329
There will be pain.

13:16.430 --> 13:17.964
Once it is in place,

13:18.032 --> 13:20.866
I push on this gizmet, here...

13:20.934 --> 13:24.436
revealing the umbrella-like
apparatus that does the work.

13:24.504 --> 13:29.541
The instrument is withdrawn
and thus it will scrape clear

13:29.609 --> 13:33.812
the pus and discharge
upon its exit.

13:33.913 --> 13:36.148
Are you ready?

13:36.216 --> 13:37.783
No.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.058
Bite on this.

14:00.508 --> 14:04.711
<i>Be sure, I have seen</i>
<i>the vision of God.</i>

14:04.779 --> 14:08.849
As I have heard the
words of his angels.

14:08.917 --> 14:13.888
God has chosen us
to purify his church

14:13.956 --> 14:19.661
but for these angels,
life is just a moment.

14:19.728 --> 14:24.166
A breath of wind
upon their cheeks.

14:27.204 --> 14:32.575
But life hereafter
is an eternity!

14:32.643 --> 14:36.378
And every day you
live is Judgment Day.

14:36.479 --> 14:40.015
Now which of you can tell me,

14:40.083 --> 14:42.550
what is Judgment Day?

14:44.353 --> 14:46.621
What is your name?
Angelo.

14:46.688 --> 14:47.988
Angelo.
You see?

14:48.056 --> 14:51.392
We have an angel amongst us.

14:51.459 --> 14:56.063
So, Angelo, tell us,
what is Judgment Day?

14:56.131 --> 14:59.299
<i>It is when the son of man</i>
<i>will return in his glory,</i>

14:59.400 --> 15:00.834
the graves will open,

15:00.902 --> 15:02.936
and the living and the
dead will be judged

15:03.004 --> 15:05.739
and sent to Heaven or Hell.

15:05.807 --> 15:12.680
An eternity in Heaven
or an eternity in Hell!

15:12.747 --> 15:15.583
Yes! Yes! Yes!

15:17.152 --> 15:25.427
Oh, my friends, this world
is crowded with vanity.

15:25.495 --> 15:29.598
What you see in the mirror
is but an illusion.

15:29.666 --> 15:34.569
Until you have cast
off your fine clothes-

15:34.637 --> 15:37.905
<i>-the jewels in your hair,</i>

15:37.973 --> 15:42.877
<i>your lewd pictures</i>
<i>in your pagan books-</i>

15:42.944 --> 15:49.015
<i>-your wines, your</i>
<i>courtesans, your paramours,</i>

15:49.083 --> 15:53.554
<i>your lust for all the things</i>
<i>in life that you crave!</i>

15:53.622 --> 15:56.223
This man has been ordered not
to preach and remain silent.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.326
It is the loudest silence
I have ever heard.

15:58.427 --> 16:02.030
This is in direct defiance
of the papal order.

16:02.098 --> 16:03.699
But no surprise.

16:06.403 --> 16:08.671
What is all this?
Vanities.

16:08.739 --> 16:11.541
Waiting like a
witch for the fire.

16:11.608 --> 16:15.444
...<i>until that time,</i>
<i>you are damned</i>

16:15.512 --> 16:19.014
<i>and the doors to Heaven</i>
<i>will remain closed.</i>

16:19.082 --> 16:24.953
Which of you would like to
stand and contradict that?

16:47.212 --> 16:49.080
<i>Line up!</i>

16:49.181 --> 16:51.249
<i>Stand in tight!</i>

16:56.555 --> 16:59.190
<i>Soldiers!</i>
<i>Papal guards!</i>

16:59.257 --> 17:01.592
<i>To arms!</i>
<i>To arms!</i>

17:01.660 --> 17:03.394
Summon the Lady Sforza.

17:03.462 --> 17:04.694
<i>Soldiers approaching!</i>

17:04.762 --> 17:06.063
<i>To your stations!</i>

17:06.164 --> 17:09.134
Stand to!
Awaiting orders!

17:09.201 --> 17:11.402
More archers
to the main gate!

17:14.406 --> 17:17.175
Take your positions!

17:17.242 --> 17:18.544
<i>Gunners!</i>

17:18.645 --> 17:20.913
Quickly!
Ready yourselves!

17:20.981 --> 17:23.549
Cannon forward!
Forward!

17:28.089 --> 17:29.890
<i>Seal the gates!</i>

17:37.297 --> 17:39.465
<i>Sir!</i>

17:39.532 --> 17:41.467
<i>Make way!</i>

17:41.568 --> 17:43.268
Cannons ready!

17:43.336 --> 17:45.104
<i>Do not shoot!</i>

17:47.907 --> 17:49.375
Move the line out!

17:53.913 --> 17:56.081
How many men
are in the castle?

17:56.149 --> 17:57.783
It's not known.

17:57.851 --> 17:59.918
We most likely outnumber them.

17:59.986 --> 18:02.287
We pray we outnumber them,
yes?

18:02.355 --> 18:03.922
There is big danger here,
my lord.

18:04.023 --> 18:05.791
Speak with this woman.

18:05.859 --> 18:07.326
The Bitch of Forli.

18:07.393 --> 18:09.194
Bitch?

18:09.262 --> 18:11.597
Yes, speak with this
bitch and speak soon.

18:11.664 --> 18:13.865
A white flag.
A truce.

18:13.933 --> 18:16.468
State your terms before they
turn those cannons onto us.

18:16.535 --> 18:19.371
We will keep the army
back in the trees.

18:19.471 --> 18:20.738
Yes.

18:20.806 --> 18:23.107
Out of reach of the cannon.
Venga!

18:25.676 --> 18:27.744
<i>Make way for the horses!</i>

18:34.752 --> 18:36.119
Yah.

18:38.724 --> 18:40.358
<i>Shields!</i>

18:40.426 --> 18:41.893
<i>Form up!</i>

18:41.960 --> 18:43.929
<i>Standard bearers!</i>

18:57.644 --> 18:59.445
Presenting the most honourable

18:59.513 --> 19:02.214
Calvino Pallavicini da Genova.

19:11.490 --> 19:13.357
Holiness.

19:20.333 --> 19:25.103
The Lady Lucrezia will
be here presently.

19:45.158 --> 19:47.326
Oh.

19:50.964 --> 19:53.499
Our daughter's pet.

19:53.566 --> 19:55.668
<i>It goes everywhere with her.</i>

20:08.480 --> 20:11.249
Presenting the most
gracious Lucrezia Borgia.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.801
Father.

20:29.605 --> 20:31.573
Holy Father...

20:31.641 --> 20:33.474
We have been waiting!

20:33.542 --> 20:35.443
The baby cried and
would not stop.

20:44.887 --> 20:47.421
Madame,
may I present my brother,

20:47.489 --> 20:50.324
<i>Calvino Pallavicini da Genova.</i>

20:50.391 --> 20:53.994
Lady.
I am honoured.

20:54.062 --> 20:57.264
And I am truly
honoured to meet you.

21:03.103 --> 21:04.537
Father.

21:06.072 --> 21:07.806
<i>Lucrezia!</i>

21:09.642 --> 21:10.875
Oh!

21:10.943 --> 21:12.677
Sir, forgive me, I forget.

21:12.745 --> 21:16.380
Please accept this
beast as a gift.

21:16.448 --> 21:18.449
It is the only one
of its kind in the land.

21:21.754 --> 21:25.189
He eats only meat.

21:40.307 --> 21:42.175
White flag!

21:42.276 --> 21:44.344
<i>White flag!</i>

22:31.058 --> 22:33.025
You are Catherina Sforza.

22:33.093 --> 22:35.828
I am Catherina Sforza.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.529
I am Juan Borgia,
Duke of Gandia,

22:37.597 --> 22:38.964
commander of the papal army.

22:39.032 --> 22:40.532
I am here to command
you to proceed

22:40.600 --> 22:42.734
under our escort
to the Holy City

22:42.802 --> 22:44.136
and humbly swear allegiance

22:44.203 --> 22:47.538
to our most Holy Father,
Pope Alexander the Sixth.

22:49.875 --> 22:52.843
The whore of Rome first
sent one boy to do his work-

22:52.944 --> 22:54.578
a murderer-

22:54.646 --> 22:56.480
and now he sends another.

22:58.016 --> 23:01.986
You bring a boy
to protect you?

23:02.054 --> 23:04.122
Is he strong enough
to hold a sword?

23:04.190 --> 23:05.490
He is my son

23:05.558 --> 23:07.660
and he is worth more than
a whole nest of Borgias.

23:10.197 --> 23:12.098
Is our business
here done?

23:12.166 --> 23:14.467
Be warned, failure to
comply with this order

23:14.534 --> 23:16.368
will find you guilty
of betrayal

23:16.436 --> 23:20.039
and your estate
shall be confiscated.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.741
Here.

23:21.809 --> 23:25.378
Here is my estate;
here is my land.

23:27.514 --> 23:30.750
Take it if you can; my cannons
will answer your call.

23:35.823 --> 23:37.490
Whoa!

23:37.592 --> 23:38.959
Benito!
Grab the boy!

23:39.026 --> 23:40.594
Grab the boy!
Yah!

23:40.695 --> 23:42.162
Go!
Mother!

23:42.230 --> 23:44.131
No!
Please! Help!

23:46.201 --> 23:48.669
I warned you, Sforza!
Stop!

23:48.737 --> 23:50.772
Don't shoot!
Don't fire!

23:50.839 --> 23:52.207
<i>Hold your arrows!</i>

23:52.274 --> 23:53.541
<i>Help!</i>

23:53.609 --> 23:55.643
Help!
Shields up!

23:55.711 --> 23:58.345
<i>Wait, my lady!</i>
<i>It's too dangerous!</i>

23:58.447 --> 24:00.581
<i>Hold formation!</i>

24:00.649 --> 24:02.383
Go back!

24:02.451 --> 24:03.951
My lady!

24:04.053 --> 24:05.620
Go back!

24:05.688 --> 24:07.589
Open the gates!

24:10.093 --> 24:11.693
Yah!

24:27.273 --> 24:28.974
How many years do you have?

24:29.075 --> 24:30.775
Sir?

24:30.843 --> 24:33.344
How old are you?

24:33.412 --> 24:35.346
I am 15 years, sir.

24:41.352 --> 24:43.153
Then you have 15 years.

24:43.254 --> 24:44.955
Yes, sir.

24:45.022 --> 24:48.224
And how many years
do you have left?

24:48.292 --> 24:50.426
I do not know.
Does your mother love you?

24:52.129 --> 24:54.264
I think she does, yes.

24:54.332 --> 24:57.501
How much does your
mother love you?

24:57.568 --> 25:00.437
That is hard to tell.

25:00.505 --> 25:02.907
How much does your
mother love you?

25:02.974 --> 25:04.776
Ahh!

25:07.013 --> 25:08.814
It is for me to
ask the questions

25:08.881 --> 25:11.250
and for you to answer them.

25:11.351 --> 25:13.552
Yes, sir.

25:13.620 --> 25:17.689
We are going to torture you.

25:19.125 --> 25:22.827
We could start here-yes?

25:22.928 --> 25:25.796
With a sharp knife.

25:25.864 --> 25:29.266
There'll be lots of blood.

25:29.367 --> 25:31.067
You might even die.

25:32.904 --> 25:35.338
How does that
make you feel?

25:35.406 --> 25:38.275
There is nothing
I can tell you.

25:38.343 --> 25:40.543
Well, that is
your misfortune.

25:42.146 --> 25:43.413
We are not going
to torture you

25:43.481 --> 25:46.249
because we want you
to tell us something;

25:46.317 --> 25:47.885
we are going
to torture you

25:47.952 --> 25:49.787
so that your mother
can see you suffer.

26:18.551 --> 26:21.220
So, from here
he walked to the Tiber

26:21.321 --> 26:22.554
and then stopped
for a while

26:22.622 --> 26:24.923
to do a picture
of the Castel Sant'Angelo.

26:24.991 --> 26:26.925
And then?

26:26.993 --> 26:31.162
From there he walked to
the ruins on Via Aurelia

26:31.230 --> 26:33.398
where he sat
for several hours-

26:33.499 --> 26:35.399
drawing and painting.

26:35.467 --> 26:37.001
What else?

26:38.270 --> 26:40.271
He ate an apple.

26:45.944 --> 26:48.580
And did he meet with anyone?

26:48.681 --> 26:50.214
No one.

26:57.089 --> 26:59.390
I don't think there's
anyone else, my lady.

27:07.633 --> 27:09.567
Here...

27:13.039 --> 27:18.543
Go to the store
on the Piazza de Navona

27:18.610 --> 27:20.745
and buy me
some paints-

27:20.813 --> 27:23.781
artist's paints-
brushes and the like.

27:23.849 --> 27:26.284
I wish to become an artist.

27:33.125 --> 27:35.660
<i>Man the ramparts!</i>

27:35.727 --> 27:37.328
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

27:39.764 --> 27:44.167
My lady, their army has
gathered in the forest

27:44.235 --> 27:46.035
beyond the range
of the cannon.

27:46.103 --> 27:48.037
And we cannot estimate
their numbers.

27:48.105 --> 27:49.405
We wait.

27:49.473 --> 27:51.407
You cannot march an
army into Romagna

27:51.475 --> 27:53.142
and word not travel.

27:53.210 --> 27:55.745
Ludovico and his
army will come,

27:55.813 --> 27:58.047
then we will spill some blood.

27:58.148 --> 27:59.882
Can we depend on Ludovico?

27:59.950 --> 28:02.953
Ludovico is like the
wind, we know this,

28:03.021 --> 28:05.055
but he is family.

28:05.122 --> 28:07.624
We made a pact.
Each to help the other.

28:07.725 --> 28:09.426
<i>Bring the prisoner!</i>

28:11.062 --> 28:14.064
<i>General's escort!</i>
<i>Forward!</i>

28:14.131 --> 28:15.332
What is this?

28:16.868 --> 28:18.168
<i>Ahh!</i>

28:19.437 --> 28:21.171
What are they doing
to my son?

28:22.340 --> 28:25.509
Call to your mother.

28:25.610 --> 28:26.610
There.

28:26.711 --> 28:27.978
In the battlements.

28:28.046 --> 28:29.579
Call to the bitch.

28:29.647 --> 28:31.148
Mother.

28:31.249 --> 28:33.350
Louder!

28:33.451 --> 28:34.985
Mother.

28:35.053 --> 28:36.954
<i>Ahh!</i>

28:37.022 --> 28:38.789
Scream to her.

28:38.857 --> 28:40.691
MOTHER!
I'm here.

28:40.759 --> 28:42.727
Louder!
I am here!

28:44.697 --> 28:46.998
MOTHER!
I am here!

28:48.268 --> 28:49.334
Ahh!

28:49.402 --> 28:51.503
Please!

28:51.570 --> 28:52.904
Borgia bastard.

28:52.972 --> 28:55.640
Tell her you are afraid.
Tell her you're afraid!

29:01.780 --> 29:03.180
I am afraid, Mother.

29:03.248 --> 29:05.616
Tell her-"Help me."

29:07.352 --> 29:08.385
Ahh!

29:08.453 --> 29:11.454
Help! Help!
Louder! Louder!

29:11.556 --> 29:13.256
Stop!
Louder!

29:13.357 --> 29:14.892
Help!

29:14.993 --> 29:18.463
Tell her that
we will torture you.

29:18.564 --> 29:20.465
They'll torture me.

29:20.566 --> 29:21.900
Please.

29:22.001 --> 29:24.169
Men do not torture boys!

29:24.237 --> 29:26.839
Not even ones worth a
whole nest of Borgias?

29:26.940 --> 29:28.674
Release my son!

29:28.742 --> 29:31.910
Surrender to my forces,
give up your castle,

29:31.978 --> 29:33.378
journey to Rome,

29:33.446 --> 29:36.915
bend your knee to the
Holy Father, and then...

29:36.983 --> 29:41.819
then I will release your
son into your loving arms!

29:45.056 --> 29:46.990
Dead.

29:47.058 --> 29:49.159
General,
is this a noble act?

29:49.226 --> 29:50.293
What?

29:50.361 --> 29:53.162
The torture of this boy?

29:53.230 --> 29:55.065
You surprise me.

29:55.132 --> 29:57.067
If you don't have the
stomach for the spectacle,

29:57.134 --> 29:59.569
you'll find that
Spain lies that way.

29:59.671 --> 30:02.106
Men, with me!
Hold shields!

30:02.174 --> 30:05.477
<i>Hold guard!</i>

30:05.578 --> 30:07.212
Ahh!
Stay with him.

30:09.281 --> 30:12.551
My son...

30:12.652 --> 30:15.753
live or die...

30:15.854 --> 30:19.491
I swear these men will
not make old bones.

30:21.260 --> 30:23.395
Mother.

30:25.698 --> 30:27.833
<i>Mother!</i>

30:27.900 --> 30:30.102
Open up!
Open up!

30:32.272 --> 30:34.139
<i>They're coming!</i>
<i>How can you stop them?</i>

30:34.207 --> 30:36.441
They're coming back.
<i>Let's go home!</i>

30:36.509 --> 30:38.644
To think, Florence was
once a joyful city.

30:38.711 --> 30:40.145
Open up!

30:40.213 --> 30:42.881
There is word your brother
has returned from Spain

30:42.949 --> 30:46.385
and has been ordered to bring
the Sforza woman to her knees.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.186
Hmm...

30:48.254 --> 30:50.022
Well, I wish him good fortune.

30:50.123 --> 30:52.124
She has sharp teeth.

30:52.192 --> 30:55.394
So the papal army has laid
siege to the castle at Forli.

30:55.495 --> 30:57.497
To her castle or to her bed?

30:57.598 --> 30:58.764
Oh there's more.

30:58.832 --> 31:00.499
Ludovico of Milan

31:00.567 --> 31:03.303
is marching on Forli
to break the siege.

31:03.370 --> 31:04.670
He is on the move.

31:04.738 --> 31:07.506
The papal army will find
itself under attack.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.408
Could a messenger reach
my brother in time

31:09.509 --> 31:10.776
to warn him of the attack?

31:10.844 --> 31:12.044
That would depend

31:12.112 --> 31:13.845
on how fast the messenger
chooses to ride.

31:13.946 --> 31:15.948
The threat is imminent.

31:21.053 --> 31:24.388
<i>Open up! Open up!</i>

31:24.456 --> 31:29.092
My father, the Holy Father,
gave me this mission.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.394
It's plain,
my duty lies here.

31:31.462 --> 31:33.430
My brother's
a military man

31:33.498 --> 31:36.367
and trained in
the art of warfare.

31:36.435 --> 31:39.871
I'm sure he'll find a
strategy to defend his army-

31:39.939 --> 31:41.306
and himself.

31:41.374 --> 31:43.775
<i>Hand them over!</i>

31:43.843 --> 31:45.510
<i>Don't be vain,</i>
<i>be righteous!</i>

31:49.182 --> 31:51.750
God's children are
knocking at the door.

31:51.817 --> 31:54.552
God will follow later.

31:54.620 --> 31:56.754
Would you care to answer?
Give us your riches!

31:56.822 --> 31:58.623
No.
Open the door!

31:58.724 --> 32:01.225
Would you?
No.

32:04.729 --> 32:07.698
I hear no knocking.
Don't be vain, be righteous!

32:35.497 --> 32:37.331
What are you
doing here?

32:37.399 --> 32:39.634
How do you know
this place?

32:39.735 --> 32:42.904
Uh, a recent discovery.

32:42.972 --> 32:44.639
And you?

32:44.707 --> 32:46.508
I come here often.

32:46.575 --> 32:49.711
To paint
and to read the poets.

32:49.779 --> 32:52.081
Have you painted for long?

32:52.148 --> 32:54.717
No, not long at all.

32:54.784 --> 32:56.685
May I see your work?

32:56.753 --> 33:00.256
Oh.
I think not.

33:00.323 --> 33:02.091
Who are your
favourite poets?

33:02.159 --> 33:03.393
I read them all.

33:03.460 --> 33:07.231
I love Ovid
and I love Sappho.

33:07.298 --> 33:13.470
"Someone will remember us,
even in another time."

33:13.538 --> 33:16.640
"Even in another time."

33:19.977 --> 33:23.746
And you,
are you an artist?

33:23.814 --> 33:27.416
No, I'm a bored nobleman

33:27.484 --> 33:29.051
from a family
of considerable wealth

33:29.119 --> 33:30.653
with too much time
on my hands.

33:30.754 --> 33:36.759
I paint and draw,
pretend to be an artist.

33:36.860 --> 33:39.796
Well then,
I will pretend with you.

33:42.567 --> 33:45.536
What happened
to your hand?

33:45.604 --> 33:49.007
Oh, I was bitten.
By a panther.

33:49.075 --> 33:52.612
Yes, I remember
the beast.

33:52.679 --> 33:57.482
It dared to bite such
a beautiful hand?

33:57.583 --> 34:01.018
And thus I cannot
paint today.

34:03.822 --> 34:06.123
Will you marry my brother?

34:09.761 --> 34:12.929
Would he make a worthy husband?

34:12.996 --> 34:14.563
He is an honourable man

34:14.632 --> 34:18.402
so, yes, I think he will
make a worthy husband.

34:21.505 --> 34:24.775
For me?

34:24.876 --> 34:26.210
Well, he is the elder son.

34:26.277 --> 34:30.281
He has lands,
a fleet of ships, power.

34:32.585 --> 34:34.652
But that is not love, is it?

34:37.623 --> 34:39.958
No, that's not love.

34:43.899 --> 34:45.966
This is the perfect place.

34:48.070 --> 34:50.338
For what?

34:52.572 --> 34:54.674
A kiss.

35:26.808 --> 35:27.975
Vanities!

35:28.043 --> 35:29.344
Your gold, your silver.
Wait!

35:29.445 --> 35:30.913
Before you speak,

35:30.980 --> 35:34.149
I would have you cease marking
chalk crosses on my door.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.417
You may continue.

35:35.518 --> 35:37.018
Vanities.

35:37.086 --> 35:40.688
Your gold, your silver,
your trinkets, your books.

35:40.756 --> 35:43.258
Give up your vanities!
I have no vanities.

35:43.359 --> 35:44.960
I have only my intellect,

35:45.027 --> 35:46.895
which I am reluctant
to relinquish.

35:46.963 --> 35:48.263
And, as you can see,

35:48.331 --> 35:50.766
with these looks
I have no vanity.

35:50.834 --> 35:54.537
An eternity in Heaven
or an eternity in Hell.

35:54.604 --> 35:56.138
What will it be?

35:56.206 --> 35:59.475
Hell is here in this city.

35:59.542 --> 36:02.911
Heaven has, of late, been
removed to another place.

36:02.979 --> 36:04.246
<i>Are you a sinner?</i>

36:04.314 --> 36:06.048
The son of man will
return in his glory

36:06.116 --> 36:09.452
and he will judge both
the quick and the dead.

36:09.519 --> 36:12.054
Give up your vanities or
face the wrath of God.

36:12.122 --> 36:13.823
Give 'em up.
Give up your vanities!

36:13.890 --> 36:17.826
Give up your vanities!

36:17.894 --> 36:19.461
Would you have us
break your windows?

36:19.529 --> 36:21.263
<i>Yes, would you?</i>

36:21.331 --> 36:24.967
So, God is now reduced
to breaking windows.

36:26.669 --> 36:29.737
Wait.
One moment.

36:40.682 --> 36:42.650
Here.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.553
Come to the square -

37:10.843 --> 37:12.711
How long can you
watch your son suffer

37:12.779 --> 37:15.981
at the hands of this man?

37:16.049 --> 37:18.050
Revenge will harden the heart.

37:18.118 --> 37:19.785
<i>Open ranks!</i>

37:19.853 --> 37:21.655
If my son must die,
then so be it.

37:21.756 --> 37:23.457
<i>General.</i>

37:26.728 --> 37:29.397
<i>My lady.</i>

37:29.465 --> 37:30.999
There!

37:31.067 --> 37:32.567
<i>You think you can</i>
<i>beat me, Sforza?</i>

37:37.906 --> 37:42.109
One arrow and we can deprive
them of their leader.

37:44.044 --> 37:46.112
<i>The boy weakens, my lord.</i>

37:48.281 --> 37:50.082
Can you kill him?

37:55.555 --> 37:57.223
Do it.

37:59.293 --> 38:01.494
Ahh!
Formation! Formation!

38:01.562 --> 38:02.929
Close the gaps, quickly!

38:08.736 --> 38:11.204
<i>Archers ready!</i>

38:11.272 --> 38:13.106
For every arrow!

38:16.610 --> 38:19.045
Ahh!
For every man you hit,

38:20.447 --> 38:23.782
I'll take one of
your son's fingers.

38:29.621 --> 38:31.222
See!

38:31.323 --> 38:33.390
And then I'll hack off his head.

38:37.062 --> 38:38.830
<i>Soldiers, shield!</i>

38:40.032 --> 38:41.298
General!

38:41.366 --> 38:42.866
<i>Form a shield wall!</i>

38:46.571 --> 38:48.406
Mother!
Grab him!

38:48.507 --> 38:49.673
<i>Mother!</i>

39:03.590 --> 39:06.693
<i>Ropes!</i>
<i>Tie him!</i>

39:11.932 --> 39:13.966
Medic!

39:18.204 --> 39:21.840
Let me say, I think
I know what's in your mind.

39:21.907 --> 39:24.975
Tell me, have you
fallen in love?

39:25.043 --> 39:26.910
How am I to know?

39:26.978 --> 39:29.879
My heart is still with Paulo.

39:29.980 --> 39:34.284
But, if I am to marry,

39:34.352 --> 39:36.753
to be sold like a sheep,
as my father would have it,

39:36.821 --> 39:39.890
then I would rather
have it be my choice.

39:39.958 --> 39:41.492
Shush, shush.

39:41.559 --> 39:42.993
Just pick him up.

39:43.094 --> 39:44.428
I've just fed him.

39:45.797 --> 39:47.898
Why defy your father?

39:47.999 --> 39:50.167
He has great love for you.

39:50.235 --> 39:53.504
Marriage is a civilized
arrangement of mutual benefit;

39:53.572 --> 39:55.072
it's not a cattle market.

39:55.140 --> 39:56.841
But I thought that
was a cattle market.

39:56.909 --> 39:58.843
You give me money,
I give you a sheep.

39:58.911 --> 40:02.313
Only in this case,
I am the sheep.

40:02.380 --> 40:06.517
Mother, if I am to choose,

40:06.585 --> 40:09.787
then please not Calvino
Pallavicini da Genova.

40:09.854 --> 40:12.189
Who then?

40:14.493 --> 40:15.893
Oh, let me take him.

40:15.994 --> 40:18.529
Come to me.
Come to me.

40:18.597 --> 40:19.897
Ba-dup, ba-dup.

40:19.998 --> 40:22.432
There he is.

40:22.500 --> 40:25.069
It's the brother, yes?

40:26.839 --> 40:28.873
Why not?

40:28.941 --> 40:31.642
I knew it.

40:31.743 --> 40:33.744
Oh, Lucrezia...

40:33.845 --> 40:35.379
This is not possible.

40:35.447 --> 40:38.816
Put it out of your mind.

40:38.883 --> 40:42.819
It's the golden rule:
never marry the second son.

40:42.887 --> 40:44.721
Your father will never agree.

40:44.822 --> 40:47.457
Well, then, I will not marry.

40:47.525 --> 40:49.926
Are you in love with him?

40:50.027 --> 40:52.828
No...

40:52.930 --> 40:55.699
I don't know.

40:55.767 --> 40:58.002
I-I don't want to fall in love,

40:58.103 --> 41:00.204
it causes too much pain.

41:00.272 --> 41:02.207
But you desire him.

41:04.744 --> 41:07.179
I have that craving, yes.

41:07.247 --> 41:09.215
And why not?

41:11.184 --> 41:13.185
Why not, indeed?

41:31.836 --> 41:33.037
<i>Have you given up</i>
<i>your gold, Cardinal?</i>

41:33.104 --> 41:34.505
<i>Have you?</i>

41:34.573 --> 41:35.806
<i>Those robes are the</i>
<i>trappings of blasphemy!</i>

41:35.874 --> 41:38.076
<i>Burn him all the same!</i>

41:38.144 --> 41:39.611
Sandro Botticelli.
The painter.

41:39.679 --> 41:43.115
<i>There he is!</i>
<i>The Medici whore!</i>

42:03.537 --> 42:05.505
<i>Save us!</i>

42:05.606 --> 42:08.207
<i>Save our souls!</i>

42:40.574 --> 42:43.242
I should have brought
my print of the Decameron.

42:43.343 --> 42:45.611
Boccaccio would
have been amused.

42:45.712 --> 42:48.614
He could have written
a fine story about this.

42:48.715 --> 42:50.883
The one hundred and first.

42:54.121 --> 42:56.823
There goes the Botticelli.

42:56.890 --> 43:00.893
Months to paint,
a moment to burn.

43:08.602 --> 43:13.005
Cardinal Cesare Borgia,
my Bonfire of the Vanities!

43:13.073 --> 43:17.076
Stand too close and your
mozzetta will turn to fire.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.713
And you, Signor Machiavelli,

43:19.781 --> 43:21.882
have you brought
your works to burn?

43:21.949 --> 43:24.017
Be sure, we will
visit your house,

43:24.085 --> 43:29.056
seek them out, and consign
them to the flames!

44:10.066 --> 44:12.467
Six times you've
taken the poison

44:12.535 --> 44:16.271
and each time your
resistance grows.

44:26.182 --> 44:30.518
This is the seventh.

44:30.586 --> 44:32.353
"When the lamb opened
the seventh seal

44:32.454 --> 44:34.856
there was silence in heaven."

44:34.924 --> 44:38.260
Is that all there is?
Silence?

44:40.330 --> 44:45.168
I feel as if I go to the other
side of life and then return.

44:45.236 --> 44:48.471
Do you have visions?

44:50.174 --> 44:52.843
Just darkness.

44:52.944 --> 44:55.646
And shadows.

45:26.513 --> 45:30.050
We grow weary
in extremis of this game.

45:30.117 --> 45:31.818
It is no game.

45:31.886 --> 45:33.921
No, it is no game!

45:36.590 --> 45:38.124
It is not simply a matter

45:38.192 --> 45:40.093
of you satisfying
your own sweet self!

45:41.895 --> 45:45.298
Your indecision is a
gift to our enemies.

45:45.366 --> 45:47.033
A folly!

45:47.101 --> 45:52.405
This could cost us our
lives, our home, our all!

45:54.507 --> 45:57.876
You are marrying
for all of us, Lucrezia,

45:57.944 --> 45:59.778
not just yourself.

45:59.846 --> 46:02.147
For family!

46:02.215 --> 46:04.216
What a burden.

46:07.754 --> 46:10.622
Did you not have hopes of
capturing Alfonso d'Aragona?

46:10.690 --> 46:13.392
He's young, powerful.
Surely he'd do nicely.

46:13.460 --> 46:15.561
A message was sent
to the south.

46:15.629 --> 46:18.398
His arrival was expected
but never fulfilled.

46:31.013 --> 46:34.883
What more is to be said?

46:34.984 --> 46:36.885
Sell me to the highest bidder.

46:41.057 --> 46:42.423
<i>Lord Sforza!</i>

46:42.491 --> 46:44.959
<i>We approach Forli!</i>

46:45.027 --> 46:47.328
<i>Muffle your arms!</i>

46:56.638 --> 46:59.040
At your ready.
Shields.

47:00.510 --> 47:03.445
Here is your son!

47:03.513 --> 47:05.882
He is waiting to die!

47:05.949 --> 47:09.252
Archers, prepare.

47:09.319 --> 47:11.087
For you!

47:16.260 --> 47:18.528
What is your answer?

47:25.737 --> 47:28.905
God will be my judge...

47:31.642 --> 47:34.777
...but I will never,

47:34.845 --> 47:37.180
NEVER bend my knee

47:37.247 --> 47:39.349
to the whoremaster of Rome.

47:44.655 --> 47:46.290
Is that your answer?

47:51.296 --> 47:53.364
<i>Load the piece quickly!</i>

48:00.772 --> 48:03.341
This is my answer.

48:04.776 --> 48:09.013
You can take my son,

48:09.114 --> 48:11.182
but do you see?

48:11.249 --> 48:12.450
Here!

48:15.087 --> 48:18.623
I have the means to
produce TEN MORE SONS!

48:18.691 --> 48:24.396
And they will hunt you down
and send you to your grave.

48:24.497 --> 48:26.265
<i>Enough.</i>

48:26.333 --> 48:28.301
<i>Get ready.</i>

48:28.369 --> 48:30.470
Ludovico is here!

48:30.538 --> 48:33.207
Fire!

48:33.274 --> 48:34.208
We are under attack!

48:34.275 --> 48:35.942
Hunt the Borgia down.

48:36.043 --> 48:38.211
Bombard at the ready!
Yes sir.

48:38.279 --> 48:39.846
Fire!

48:40.914 --> 48:42.916
Forward!
After them!

48:44.886 --> 48:46.854
Kill the boy!
We are under attack in the forest.

48:46.921 --> 48:49.323
What are your orders?
Kill the boy!

48:49.391 --> 48:51.192
<i>Hang him!</i>

48:51.259 --> 48:52.860
No!

48:52.927 --> 48:54.228
Yah!

48:55.397 --> 48:56.997
No!
Yah!

48:57.065 --> 48:59.499
Save him!
Save my son!

48:59.600 --> 49:02.135
General!
Archers!

49:02.236 --> 49:03.769
Attack!

49:07.007 --> 49:08.673
<i>Fire!</i>

49:23.121 --> 49:24.121
Release!

49:26.257 --> 49:27.857
Release!

49:32.663 --> 49:35.198
Come about!
They're on both sides!

49:46.078 --> 49:48.313
Attack!
