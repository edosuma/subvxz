WEBVTT

00:15.633 --> 00:17.400
- Ah geez...

00:22.633 --> 00:24.067
- Freeze!
- Ah!

00:24.167 --> 00:26.067
- Whoah, wait one sec...

00:32.267 --> 00:33.300
- Trip?!?

00:33.400 --> 00:34.700
- Owwww.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.667
- Why'd you sneak up
on me like that?

00:36.767 --> 00:39.767
- 'Cuz I didn't know you were
gonna be here this mornin'!

00:39.867 --> 00:41.300
I thought you were a burglar...

00:41.400 --> 00:42.567
comin' to burgle me.

00:44.067 --> 00:45.667
- Well, what are you
doing here at...

00:45.767 --> 00:48.300
6:30 in the morning?

00:48.400 --> 00:49.400
- I slept here.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.467
- Wh... you spent
the whole night here?!?

00:51.567 --> 00:54.533
- Yeah, 'cuz my dad
decided to have a fire drill

00:54.633 --> 00:56.033
at our house last night.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.700
- So, what's wrong with Dub
having a fire drill?

00:58.800 --> 01:01.133
- The man locks all
the doors in the house,

01:01.233 --> 01:03.467
and then actually
sets a couch on fire.

01:04.967 --> 01:06.300
- Okay, that is messed up.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.967
- Pff. Yeah.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.600
- Wait, does Dub know
that you're here?

01:11.700 --> 01:13.100
- No, why?

01:13.200 --> 01:15.000
- 'Cuz I was on my way
to school this morning,

01:15.067 --> 01:17.800
and he left me this
voice message...

01:17.900 --> 01:19.900
- Hey Babe!
This is an emergency!

01:20.067 --> 01:21.967
Meet me at Game Shakers
before you go to school!

01:23.333 --> 01:26.500
Ahhh, dang it Bunny!
You sat on my egg and muffin!

01:28.100 --> 01:30.067
- Well, why didn't he say
what the emergency was?

01:30.100 --> 01:32.167
- I dunno, man.

01:33.867 --> 01:36.900
By the way...
cute jammy pants.

01:37.067 --> 01:38.333
- Oh... thanks.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.633
Hey uh...

01:43.733 --> 01:46.067
since you and I are here

01:46.100 --> 01:49.067
together... alone...

01:49.133 --> 01:52.533
can I talk to you about
a "guy-girl" kinda thing?

01:53.700 --> 01:54.967
- Oh, yeah sure.

01:55.067 --> 01:58.933
- Cool. Cool, cool.
See, um...

01:59.067 --> 02:00.867
I have this uh...

02:00.967 --> 02:02.100
I got this friend...

02:02.200 --> 02:04.567
- 'Kay.
A guy I know?

02:04.667 --> 02:05.867
- No, no you don't know him.

02:05.967 --> 02:08.300
- Oh.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.933
- See, my friend
works with this girl...

02:11.067 --> 02:13.467
that he really likes...

02:13.567 --> 02:15.133
a lot.

02:17.633 --> 02:19.967
- Ahem. Right. Um...

02:20.067 --> 02:24.567
And your friend...
what's his name?

02:24.667 --> 02:26.733
- Oh, Chuck.
His name's Chuck.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.767
- Okay.

02:28.867 --> 02:31.933
And Chuck likes
this girl he works with.

02:32.067 --> 02:33.267
- Yeah.

02:33.367 --> 02:34.607
Oh, and she's kind of his boss.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.733
- Oh God.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.467
- One more time?
- Oh, nothin'. Go on.

02:39.567 --> 02:42.467
- So what do you think
Chuck should do?

02:42.567 --> 02:44.267
- Well...

02:44.367 --> 02:46.200
- You think he should
just come right out

02:46.300 --> 02:47.733
and tell her how he feels?

02:47.833 --> 02:50.500
- No!
That's what he should not do.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.733
- Why not?

02:51.833 --> 02:53.600
- Okay...
listen...

02:53.700 --> 02:56.933
I'm sure your friend "Chuck"
is an awesome guy... guy!

02:57.067 --> 03:00.100
But... um,

03:00.200 --> 03:02.233
When guys and girls
work together...

03:02.333 --> 03:03.867
that's a professional
environment,

03:03.967 --> 03:07.900
and it could get really awkward
for me... for the girl...

03:08.067 --> 03:09.733
if "Chuck" tells
her he likes her.

03:09.833 --> 03:13.067
- So, he shouldn't tell her?

03:13.100 --> 03:14.233
- No, never!

03:14.333 --> 03:17.067
Ever ever ever.
Ever, ever, ever, ever.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.200
- Well... okay.
- Ever.

03:22.900 --> 03:23.900
- Hey Babe!
Yo Babe!

03:23.967 --> 03:25.533
Did you get my message?

03:25.633 --> 03:27.700
- Oh, you mean the one
where you were screaming

03:27.800 --> 03:29.767
about nothing?

03:29.867 --> 03:32.100
- Okay, sassy...

03:32.200 --> 03:34.567
I called you 'cuz you
gotta take this dog.

03:38.467 --> 03:41.567
- Wait, what am I supposed
to do with this dog?

03:41.667 --> 03:45.767
- When I was a boy, I used to
dress my dog up like Annie!

03:45.867 --> 03:48.367
From the Broadway play, Annie!

03:50.367 --> 03:53.067
Now I feel self-conscious!

03:54.467 --> 03:56.733
- Hey Bunny, why are you
holdin' up your pants like that?

03:56.833 --> 03:58.733
- 'Cuz Dub made me
take my belt off

03:58.833 --> 04:00.367
so he could use it
for a dog leash.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.867
- Okay, once again...
Why the dog?

04:03.967 --> 04:06.233
- Well, at about
4 A.M. this morning,

04:06.333 --> 04:10.433
we were leaving a party
at Shia LeBoof's hotel room.

04:10.533 --> 04:12.867
Then we started drivin'
down the West Side Highway,

04:12.967 --> 04:14.209
and I saw this dog.
And I yelled out:

04:14.233 --> 04:16.367
"Hey! Stop the car!!!"

04:16.467 --> 04:18.933
Wow... you ran across highway
traffic just to save it?

04:19.067 --> 04:22.833
- No, he made me do it.

04:22.933 --> 04:25.367
- Well, my mom's not gonna let
me keep a dog this big.

04:25.467 --> 04:26.833
- Oh just give it to Hubbins.

04:28.467 --> 04:30.133
- Dub! No.

04:30.233 --> 04:32.700
You found this dog so
it's your responsibility, okay?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.233
You can't just dump it on us.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.133
- All right.
Well, I guess

04:36.233 --> 04:39.167
we're gonna have to
go with Plan B.

04:47.433 --> 04:49.900
- Geez man!
They all just ran outta here.

04:50.067 --> 04:52.400
- No, they didn't
all run outta here.

04:55.267 --> 04:57.067
- Awww Bunny, you forgot to run!

Oh, hey Babe.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.200
The classroom.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.533

06:03.800 --> 06:04.900
Hey.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.833
- Whooaaa.
Is that a dog?

06:06.933 --> 06:10.367
- No, Hudson.
It's a little furry motorcycle.

06:10.467 --> 06:12.900
- Can I ride it?
- Hudson!

06:13.067 --> 06:15.267
Do you have a dog?
- No.

06:15.367 --> 06:18.167
- Okay...
Then do you want a dog?

06:18.267 --> 06:20.900
- Hmmm.
How much?

06:21.067 --> 06:22.133
- She's free.

06:22.233 --> 06:25.300
- Deal.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.600
Did ya hear that?

06:26.700 --> 06:30.633
The negotiation is over,
and you're mine.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.233
Hey!
What should I name her?

06:34.333 --> 06:35.767
- Hang on, I'm texting Kenzie.

06:35.867 --> 06:37.433
- Kenzie...

06:37.533 --> 06:40.633
Awww, you like that name?

06:40.733 --> 06:45.467
Okay. Then from now on,
I'm gonna call you Kenzie.

06:46.733 --> 06:49.200
- Dude, you can't
name that dog Kenzie.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.800
- Hmmm, I think I just did.

06:53.433 --> 06:54.667
- Hey, there you are.
- Hey.

06:54.767 --> 06:56.533
- See you guys later.
C'mon Kenzie...

06:56.633 --> 06:59.367
- Wh...
- Hey Kenzie.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.067
- Uh, did he just
call that dog Kenzie?

07:03.133 --> 07:04.267
- Later.
We have a problem.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.400
- Oh, what's wrong?

07:06.500 --> 07:08.367
- I'm not sure...

07:08.467 --> 07:11.133
I mean, maybe nothing,

07:11.233 --> 07:15.633
but I think Trip
might... like me.

07:15.733 --> 07:18.367
- Oh my God!
This is so cute.

07:18.467 --> 07:20.300
Trip and Babe!

07:20.400 --> 07:22.400
Ooo, your couple nickname
could be Trabe!

07:22.500 --> 07:24.733
- Hey...
Hey hey hey...

07:24.833 --> 07:28.600
There's not gonna be any
Trabe or Brip or anything.

07:30.067 --> 07:32.043
- Well, what makes you think
Trip has a crush on you?

07:32.067 --> 07:35.600
- Okay... he asked me
for advice about "his friend"

07:35.700 --> 07:38.233
who just happens
to have a big crush

07:38.333 --> 07:41.933
on "some girl" that
"his friend" works with.

07:42.067 --> 07:45.167
- And you're sure he's really
talking about him and you?

07:45.267 --> 07:47.067
- I dunno!
But what if he is?!?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.400
Oh god!
What if he is?!?

07:48.500 --> 07:51.800
- Well...
Trip's really cute and cool.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.900
- I know that...
He's awesome, but...

07:54.067 --> 07:57.867
I'm his boss.
We work together every day!

07:57.967 --> 08:00.767
We can't date the boys
we work with!

08:00.867 --> 08:03.267
I think that might even be...

08:03.367 --> 08:06.067
It might be illegal.

08:08.067 --> 08:10.867
- All right, what'd he say
his friend's name was?

08:10.967 --> 08:13.067
- Chuck.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.367
- Well, maybe he really does
have a friend named Chuck.

08:15.467 --> 08:17.400
- Maybe.

08:20.633 --> 08:24.067
- Listen.
That is not where we pee. Okay?

08:25.833 --> 08:27.100
Hey kid...

08:27.200 --> 08:29.309
will you take my dog to
homeroom while I clean this up?

08:29.333 --> 08:32.067
- Yeah, sure.

08:33.567 --> 08:36.233
- Hudson!
What happened there?

08:36.333 --> 08:38.200
- Oh.
Kenzie peed on the floor.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.067
- What?!?
- What?!?

08:40.133 --> 08:44.067
- Bad Kenzie! Bad!

08:55.067 --> 08:56.800
- Nope, see...
I'm still getting the glitch.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.433
- Yeah... gimme a minute to run
a full check on the code.

08:59.533 --> 09:02.300
- 'Kay, do your thing.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.900
- Hey Babe...

09:04.067 --> 09:05.067
- Yeah, 'sup?

09:05.167 --> 09:07.933
- Uh, I told my friend Chuck
what you said...

09:08.067 --> 09:11.167
uh, and, uh, he still
wants to make a play

09:11.267 --> 09:12.433
for that girl he works with.

09:12.533 --> 09:16.700
- M-Make a play?
Wh-what does that mean?

09:16.800 --> 09:18.367
That sounds like
some crazy stuff.

09:18.467 --> 09:20.267
- Yeah, but Chuck still thinks

09:20.367 --> 09:21.376
that she might
wanna date him, too.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.867
- No she won't.

09:23.967 --> 09:25.443
- No sh... but how
can you be so sure?

09:25.467 --> 09:28.500
- Uh...

09:28.600 --> 09:31.533
Okay, so your friend...
"Chuck"...

09:31.633 --> 09:34.767
what's his last name?

09:34.867 --> 09:35.967
- Um...

09:36.067 --> 09:37.543
I don't really think
I should tell you.

09:37.567 --> 09:41.300
- Oh really why not?

09:41.400 --> 09:43.700
- 'Cuz...
his dad is kinda famous, so...

09:43.800 --> 09:45.333
- Ohhh.

09:45.433 --> 09:48.433
So, your friend Chuck's
dad is famous...

09:48.533 --> 09:53.067
kinda like your dad's famous?

09:53.167 --> 09:54.267
- Yeah, kinda like that.

09:54.367 --> 09:57.067
- Uh-huh. Okay. Sure.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.900
- Hey! Check it!

10:03.000 --> 10:05.233
Trip, I got ya some
lunch from the Clam Jumper.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.333
- Cool, thanks.

10:07.433 --> 10:09.367
- Uh, did you bring
the rest of us any food?

10:09.467 --> 10:12.200
- Uh, no!

10:12.300 --> 10:13.420
- Well that's not very ni...

10:13.467 --> 10:14.667
- Don't worry about it.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.333
I got us tacos.
They're in the lobby.

10:16.433 --> 10:19.667
- Wow, I wasn't told
we had lobby tacos.

10:23.633 --> 10:26.267
- I don't see any tacos in here.

10:26.367 --> 10:30.067
- Hey. Did you hear Trip talking
about his fake friend Chuck?

10:30.167 --> 10:31.600
And his famous dad?

10:31.700 --> 10:34.200
- Yeah. I don't think he
really has a friend named Chuck.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.433
- Kenz...
if there's no Chuck...

10:38.533 --> 10:40.233
- Then Trip has a crush on you.

10:40.333 --> 10:41.333
- Don't say that!

10:41.400 --> 10:42.567
- Well you've been saying it.

10:42.667 --> 10:44.633
- What if Trip
does have a crush on me

10:44.733 --> 10:46.667
and he tells me,
then what am I gonna say?!?

10:46.767 --> 10:49.800
- I think your fingernails are
actually penetrating my skin.

10:52.967 --> 10:54.467
- Ooo! You hear that car crash?

10:54.567 --> 10:56.233
- Yeah! Let's go see
if anybody's hurt!

10:58.267 --> 11:01.633
- Hey, anybody hurt?
- Ahahaha.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.833
- Hang on Kenzie...

11:04.933 --> 11:06.373
somethin's wrong
with this sprayer...

11:11.833 --> 11:13.600
Come on, sprayer, work.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.600
Okay, I think I
got this to work.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.400
Kenzie!
Bad dog!

11:21.500 --> 11:23.867
That's not your clam sphere!

11:23.967 --> 11:28.267
- Kenzie!
What do I do about Trip?!?

11:28.367 --> 11:29.933
- Okay.
How 'bout this?

11:30.067 --> 11:32.833
Tell him you wanna give Chuck
advice yourself... face to face.

11:32.933 --> 11:35.567
- But there is no Chuck.
You know there's no Chuck.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.300
- Exactly. Sooo...

11:38.400 --> 11:39.676
Trip'll give you
some dumb excuse

11:39.700 --> 11:40.967
about why you can't meet him.

11:41.067 --> 11:41.867
- And then...?

11:41.967 --> 11:43.967
- Then maybe he'll give up.

11:44.067 --> 11:46.133
- I hope so.

11:48.933 --> 11:50.700
- Whooaa...

11:50.800 --> 11:53.067
- Hey, let's get this lunch
before it gets co...

11:53.100 --> 11:55.200
BAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!

11:55.300 --> 11:57.100
Who ate my clam sphere?!?

11:57.200 --> 12:00.367
Ohhhh whyyy?!

12:00.467 --> 12:01.767
Hubbins?!?

12:01.867 --> 12:03.700
- Sorry. Kenzie ate it.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.800
- Aw, Kenzie?!?
Dang it!!

12:06.900 --> 12:09.500
- Hey, listen...
the ice cream truck.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.467
Ice cream truck?!?

12:18.700 --> 12:20.233
- There she is.

12:20.333 --> 12:21.433
- Oh, hey Doubl...

12:21.533 --> 12:23.567
- Silence!

12:23.667 --> 12:26.533
I know what you did
to my clam sphere.

12:26.633 --> 12:29.100
Get ready for my payback!

12:44.067 --> 12:45.467
- So hey...

12:45.567 --> 12:48.433
um... I wanna meet Chuck.

12:48.533 --> 12:50.767
- Oh. Why?

12:50.867 --> 12:55.567
- 'Cuz, for me to give
"Chuck" my best advice,

12:55.667 --> 12:57.800
I think I should talk to him...

12:57.900 --> 13:00.867
Y'know, face to face...

13:00.967 --> 13:04.300
unless that's a problem.

13:05.733 --> 13:07.833
- All right... let's have
dinner with Chuck.

13:07.933 --> 13:09.533
- Yeah, I didn't think... Huh?

13:09.633 --> 13:11.233
- I'll go call him.

13:11.333 --> 13:15.367
- Oh. Cool.

13:15.467 --> 13:16.743
There really is a Chuck!
- I heard!

13:16.767 --> 13:17.800
- So that means I'm safe!

13:17.900 --> 13:20.533
- I know, everything's okay!

13:20.633 --> 13:22.700
- Hey Kenzie!!!

13:22.800 --> 13:26.400
The payback is comin'. Ha!

13:37.133 --> 13:38.900
- Hey. Bad news.

13:39.067 --> 13:40.700
- What?

13:40.800 --> 13:42.133
- Chuck's not comin'.

13:45.233 --> 13:46.067
- Um, whaddaya mean?

13:46.100 --> 13:48.567
- Ah, he texted me and said...

13:48.667 --> 13:51.200
"Yo dawg... sorry,
but I can't come to dinner

13:51.300 --> 13:55.133
'cuz my dad backed
over me with his truck."

13:55.233 --> 13:56.267
- Really Trip?

13:56.367 --> 13:59.300
Your friend "Chuck"
got run over by a truck?

13:59.400 --> 14:01.667
- I know... crazy, right?

14:01.767 --> 14:05.500
- Yeah, almost unbelievable.

14:05.600 --> 14:08.067
- Yep. Well...

14:08.167 --> 14:09.543
I guess dinner's just
gonna be you and me.

14:09.567 --> 14:10.967
- Yeah, uh-huh.

14:11.067 --> 14:15.867
Uhhh... Oh hi!
Come here.

14:15.967 --> 14:17.500
My name's Babe
and this is Trip...

14:17.600 --> 14:19.867
So, you look interesting...
Tell us about your life...

14:19.967 --> 14:21.500
Why don't you start
with your birth?

14:21.600 --> 14:24.733
No, no, no, come ba...

14:27.200 --> 14:28.900
Well...

14:29.067 --> 14:31.400
I guess it's just you and me.

14:43.533 --> 14:46.300
What?

14:46.400 --> 14:47.767
- Are you wearing cologne?

14:47.867 --> 14:49.133
- Oh, yeah...

14:49.233 --> 14:50.633
they had some in the bathroom,

14:50.733 --> 14:52.433
so I figured, like,
hey, free cologne.

14:52.533 --> 14:53.900
- Uh-huh.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.467
- Smells nice, huh?

14:57.300 --> 14:59.533
- Be right back.
- Wait, you're forgetting...

14:59.633 --> 15:04.133
You didn't... okay.

15:08.833 --> 15:09.833
- Hey Babe.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.067
- There is no Chuck!

15:11.167 --> 15:13.833
I repeat: There is no Chuck.

15:13.933 --> 15:15.200
- Wait wait wait...

15:15.300 --> 15:17.233
you said Chuck
was having dinner with you.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.067
- Yeah, 'cuz that's
what Trip told me!

15:19.133 --> 15:20.233
But then when I got here,

15:20.333 --> 15:21.509
he made up some
ridiculous excuse

15:21.533 --> 15:22.667
for why Chuck had to cancel,

15:22.767 --> 15:24.233
and now I'm on a date with Trip

15:24.333 --> 15:25.776
and I can't eat my salad
'cuz what if he says

15:25.800 --> 15:26.900
he's in love with me?!?

15:27.067 --> 15:28.533
- Ooo, what kinda salad
did ya get?

15:28.633 --> 15:30.467
- Kenzie!

15:30.567 --> 15:32.233
Just get down here right now!

15:33.367 --> 15:36.367
- Hey Kenz... look at this.
- What is that?

15:36.467 --> 15:40.733
- Special dog food,
for elderly dogs.

15:40.833 --> 15:42.267
- Oh...

15:42.367 --> 15:45.500
- Here...
Give it a little sniff.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.600
- I don't wanna sniff it.

15:46.700 --> 15:49.067
I have to go help Babe.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.100
- Hey! Any of you kids
seen my sunglasses?

15:51.200 --> 15:54.667
- Your what?
- I'm not talkin' to you!

15:54.767 --> 15:57.433
- Okay, I don't even understand
why you're mad at me,

15:57.533 --> 15:59.700
and why you...
- HUSH UP!

15:59.800 --> 16:03.067
I'm talkin' to Hubbins.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.143
Hey, you seen my sunglasses?

16:04.167 --> 16:05.967
- Yeah.
- Oh good!

16:06.067 --> 16:07.833
So where are they?
- I dunno.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.900
- You said you seen 'em!

16:10.067 --> 16:13.367
- Doesn't mean I know
where they are.

16:13.467 --> 16:14.933
- Baaaaaah!!!

16:16.900 --> 16:18.867
Hey boy, what's this?

16:18.967 --> 16:21.067
- Oh, that's food for Kenzie.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.867
- It's food for Kenzie?
- Yeah...

16:23.967 --> 16:26.700
I just heated it up for her.
She's gonna love it.

16:26.800 --> 16:31.367
- Heh heh, oh no she's not!

16:31.467 --> 16:35.167
- Whaddaya mean?
- I mean... It's payback time.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.200
- Hey, Kenzie!

16:37.300 --> 16:39.067
- No, no...

16:40.933 --> 16:41.933
- Look what I got!

16:41.967 --> 16:43.933
- What about it?

16:44.067 --> 16:46.600
- You eat my food?
I eat yours.

16:49.767 --> 16:53.200
- Dub...
Double G...

16:53.300 --> 16:54.100
- What's up?

16:54.200 --> 16:57.767
- You're eating dog food.

16:57.867 --> 16:59.700
- Excuse me?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.067
- That food's not for me.

17:01.167 --> 17:03.733
It's for that dog over there.

17:03.833 --> 17:05.667
- So this is dog food?

17:05.767 --> 17:06.667
- Yeah.

17:06.767 --> 17:08.367
- He named his dog Kenzie.

17:08.467 --> 17:12.067
- So...
you didn't eat my clam sphere?

17:12.167 --> 17:16.667
- No, I did not eat
your clam sphere.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.567
- That dog did?

17:18.667 --> 17:21.567
- Yup.

17:21.667 --> 17:22.733
- All right.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.900
You eat my food?
I eat yours.

17:26.067 --> 17:29.533
Hahahaha!
Mmmm-mmm-mmmm!

17:30.833 --> 17:33.133
- I'm gonna go help Babe.

17:33.233 --> 17:35.633
- Roof. Roof. A-roof.

17:35.733 --> 17:37.700
- Hehehehe.
- Good too.

17:43.067 --> 17:44.167
- Hey, Babe!

17:44.267 --> 17:45.800
- Hey!
Will you hurry up?!?

17:45.900 --> 17:48.333
- I'm walking as fast as I can!

17:48.433 --> 17:50.900
Hey! Do I have something
sticky on me?

17:51.067 --> 17:53.067
- I don't know!

17:53.133 --> 17:54.667
But this is your fault!

17:54.767 --> 17:55.767
- What'd I do?!?

17:55.867 --> 17:57.267
- You told me to meet Chuck

17:57.367 --> 17:59.567
and now I'm by myself
on a date with Trip!

18:01.433 --> 18:03.733
- You had the shrimp cocktail?

18:03.833 --> 18:06.067
- Yeah, will you please
go put it at my table

18:06.133 --> 18:07.233
- All right.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.667
- Um, that's mine...

18:11.833 --> 18:12.843
I don't wanna hurt
Trip's feelings.

18:12.867 --> 18:14.067
- You won't.

18:14.133 --> 18:15.733
I'm gonna come eat
with you guys.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.133
He's not gonna tell you he
loves you if I'm sitting there.

18:18.233 --> 18:20.233
- And what about tomorrow,
and the day after that?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.333
I can't spend every day
at work worrying

18:22.433 --> 18:24.567
that Trip's gonna tell me
he's in love with me!

18:24.667 --> 18:26.833
- Okay... I think I know
how to fix this.

18:26.933 --> 18:27.833
- Ooo, what's your plan?

18:27.933 --> 18:29.367
- All right, when we go inside,

18:29.467 --> 18:31.567
I'm gonna sit next to Trip...
- Hey.

18:31.667 --> 18:34.467
- Excuse me. I'm trying
to use the restroom.

18:35.933 --> 18:37.400
- But the restroom's
back in there.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.133
And what are you doin' out here?

18:39.233 --> 18:43.467
- I'm hungry... c'mon,
let's go eat dinner.

18:43.567 --> 18:46.100
- You know you really shouldn't
be inside the girl's restroom.

18:51.900 --> 18:55.200
- All right.
Now we can get to it.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.633
- Get to what...
Whaddaya mean "get to it"...

18:57.733 --> 18:59.867
Get to what?

19:00.067 --> 19:00.900
- To our dinner.

19:01.067 --> 19:03.500
- I know.
I know that.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.433
Like, duhhh.
Pass the cocktail sauce?

19:10.933 --> 19:12.333
- All right...

19:12.433 --> 19:15.433
you two are actin'
kinda weird, sooo... what-up?

19:15.533 --> 19:17.967
- Trip, I want you to be my bae!

19:18.067 --> 19:20.200
- Heh?
- What?!?

19:20.300 --> 19:22.209
- I'm sorry but I can't fight
my feelings anymore!

19:22.233 --> 19:23.233
Right, Babe?!?

19:23.300 --> 19:24.933
- Uhhh, sure?

19:25.067 --> 19:27.600
- Fight WHAT?
- I'm in love with you!

19:27.700 --> 19:29.667
- Ahhh!

19:29.767 --> 19:31.300
Okay now wait a minute, woo!

19:31.400 --> 19:33.567
- Yes, I knowww...
I know you're right.

19:33.667 --> 19:35.100
- He's often right.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.633
- But what'd I say?

19:36.733 --> 19:38.667
- That it would be
wrong for us to date

19:38.767 --> 19:41.400
because we're such good friends
and because we work together.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.833
- Okay but...

19:42.933 --> 19:46.267
- I guess I'll just have to
bury my feelings of love.

19:46.367 --> 19:47.967
- You gotta bury those feelings.

19:48.067 --> 19:50.733
- Because it's the right thing
to do for our friendship...

19:50.833 --> 19:52.300
- For your friendship.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.667
- And to protect our
working relationship

19:54.767 --> 19:58.367
at Game Shakers.

19:58.467 --> 19:59.833
So you can't be my bae.

20:00.067 --> 20:03.300
- Can't be her bae.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.767
- Okay, at some point
did I pass out

20:05.867 --> 20:08.400
and miss part of my life?

20:09.967 --> 20:12.300
- Yo Trip!
- Chuck!

20:12.400 --> 20:14.767
- Chuck?!?
- Chuck?!?

20:18.233 --> 20:20.367
- Hey man...
I thought you weren't comin'.

20:20.467 --> 20:22.267
- I didn't think I was,

20:22.367 --> 20:24.467
but after I got outta
the emergency room,

20:24.567 --> 20:26.500
I was hungry, so here's me.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.800
- Ah, cool cool cool.
Come sit down.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.733
Take a seat man.

20:35.467 --> 20:39.033
- You guys...
this is my friend Chuck.

20:39.133 --> 20:42.167
- Chuck's real?!?

20:42.267 --> 20:44.167
- W-We thought you made him up!

20:44.267 --> 20:46.767
- Why would I make up
a fake friend?

20:46.867 --> 20:48.900
- Well...'cuz y'know...

20:49.000 --> 20:50.867
- We thought you had
a crush on Babe.

20:50.967 --> 20:53.400
- On her?

20:53.500 --> 20:56.133
- Y-yeah, and... and that
you just made up Chuck

20:56.233 --> 20:58.533
'cuz you were afraid to tell
Babe that you loved her.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.673
- So then, Kenzie pretended
she was in love with you

21:00.767 --> 21:02.333
so you'd realize
that it'd be too weird

21:02.433 --> 21:06.367
for any of us at Game Shakers
to date each other.

21:06.467 --> 21:08.133
- Wait, wait, w-w-wait...

21:08.233 --> 21:12.433
So you both thought that
I had a crush on you?

21:12.533 --> 21:14.300
- On me? I mean technically
- Yeah, I...

21:14.400 --> 21:15.767
- if you wanna
put a label on it.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.800
Mmm.
