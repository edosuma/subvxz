Come on, let's go. Flap your wings!

04:44.502 --> 04:48.199
Those fairies on the mainland
won't be able to fly without pixie dust!

04:48.306 --> 04:51.605
Terence, have you delivered
the pixie-dust rations to the scouts yet?

04:51.709 --> 04:54.177
Yep. Finished today's
and half of tomorrow's.

04:54.278 --> 04:59.045
Remember, one cup each.
No more, no less.

Well, that's my cue.
I'll catch you guys later.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.539
And where are you off to?

05:23.107 --> 05:25.302
Just doing some errands and stuff.

05:26.711 --> 05:30.647
- Errands!
- And stuff!

05:30.748 --> 05:32.943
Why are you guys talking like that?

05:33.050 --> 05:35.314
BOTH: No reason.

05:37.054 --> 05:40.421
- All right.
- Say hi to Tinker Bell, would you?

05:40.525 --> 05:41.583
What?

05:42.760 --> 05:44.159
(ALL LAUGHING)

05:44.262 --> 05:45.627
Very funny.

I'm gonna help Tink again.

Thanks. See you tomorrow.

06:22.466 --> 06:25.128
Yeah, that's it!
Keep going. Keep going!

06:25.503 --> 06:28.666
Hey, Cheese.
Special delivery for Tinker Bell.

06:29.206 --> 06:30.400
Hi, Terence.

06:30.508 --> 06:33.375
Who's your best friend
that always delivers?

06:33.644 --> 06:34.633
Hmm.

06:34.745 --> 06:37.213
- Iridessa?
- Nope. Try again.

06:38.416 --> 06:40.213
- Fawn?
- Me!

06:40.318 --> 06:42.343

06:42.453 --> 06:45.513
<i>So, what do you think
of the Pixie Dust Express?</i>

06:45.790 --> 06:49.521
Wow. The guys are gonna love this
back at the depot,

06:50.194 --> 06:52.856
and it sure is going to help out
on the river-outpost deliveries.

06:52.964 --> 06:54.761
Hey, is that a stretchy thingy?

06:54.865 --> 06:57.925
Yeah, I thought you could use it
for your motor.

07:00.171 --> 07:01.502
(EX CLAIMS)

07:02.239 --> 07:04.230
I think it's gonna be perfect.

Okay. Are you ready
for the official test run?

Don't worry. I'll be right next to you.

07:32.236 --> 07:33.794
- All set?
- Check.

07:34.005 --> 07:35.370
Let her rip.

07:41.746 --> 07:42.838
(CHUCKLING) Whoa.

07:44.415 --> 07:46.349
And now for hydro-drive.

07:55.059 --> 07:56.185
Sorry.

(BUZZES)

07:58.696 --> 07:59.754

(GROANING)

- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

08:38.335 --> 08:39.302
(SIGHS)

08:39.403 --> 08:41.667
I can't believe the boat broke.

08:41.806 --> 08:45.333
I guess your guys
are gonna have to wait a little longer.

08:45.943 --> 08:46.932
I'm impressed.

08:47.044 --> 08:50.673
Usually when one of your inventions
doesn't work out, you overreact,

08:50.781 --> 08:52.874
but I must say,
you're handling this one pretty well.

08:52.983 --> 08:55.713
- I drove it into a tree?
- Never mind.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.087
(GROANS)

08:57.188 --> 08:58.382
Jingles!

08:58.522 --> 09:02.481
I made it to help you, Terence.
It should've worked.

09:04.795 --> 09:08.060
Come on.
Look, it just needs a little tinkering.

09:08.165 --> 09:11.191
Let's see.
Who do I know who's a good tinker?

09:11.736 --> 09:14.068
Bobble. Bobble's a good tinker.

09:14.171 --> 09:17.072
Or Fairy Mary,
she's got a lot of experience.

09:17.341 --> 09:18.968
Or... Hey, what about Clank?

09:19.076 --> 09:20.065
(TINKER BELL GIGGLING)

09:20.177 --> 09:21.667
(KAZOO HUMMING)

09:22.780 --> 09:23.747
Uh-oh.

09:23.881 --> 09:27.942
- Someone's in trouble.
- Hey, I haven't done anything, lately.

09:28.452 --> 09:29.817
The stinkbug incident?

09:29.920 --> 09:31.012
(GASPS)

09:31.122 --> 09:32.282
Oh, no.

09:32.957 --> 09:35.425
Tinker Bell, Queen Clarion awaits.

09:40.064 --> 09:41.929
TINKER BELL: It's all
a big misunderstanding.

09:42.032 --> 09:45.365
I'm sure the queen wants to see me
about something completely unrelated.

09:45.469 --> 09:46.436
(BLOWS KAZOO)

09:46.570 --> 09:47.901
One moment.

09:51.142 --> 09:54.168
Tinker Bell is here.
She's waiting outside, my lady.

09:54.278 --> 09:55.870
QUEEN CLARION: Thank you, Viola.

09:56.280 --> 09:59.772
- Fairy Mary, are you certain?
- Whatever do you mean?

09:59.884 --> 10:03.820
Only that Tinker Bell,
while undoubtedly talented, also...

10:03.921 --> 10:07.152
- Is a hothead? Flies off the handle?
- Well, yes.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.818
I believe she deserves a chance,
Minister.

10:09.927 --> 10:13.192
After all, tinker fairies
learn from their mistakes.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.563
Very well.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.025
Agreed. Tinker Bell!

10:26.510 --> 10:28.000
Fairy Mary tells me she knows...

10:28.112 --> 10:32.310
It's not my fault, Your Highness!
Those stinkbugs were asking for it.

10:37.421 --> 10:40.879
- This isn't about the stinkbugs, is it?
- No.

10:40.991 --> 10:43.516
But we can certainly
come back to that later.

10:43.627 --> 10:44.685
(LAUGHING) Mary.

10:46.130 --> 10:48.325
You do know the Minister of Autumn.

10:48.432 --> 10:50.263
- My dear.
- Hi.

10:51.035 --> 10:53.697
Are you familiar
with the great autumn revelry?

10:53.804 --> 10:57.205
Well, everyone's talking about it.
They're so excited.

10:57.508 --> 10:59.499
Since time immemorial,

10:59.610 --> 11:02.807
fairies have celebrated
the end of autumn with a revelry,

11:02.913 --> 11:08.215
and this particular autumn
coincides with a blue harvest moon.

11:08.719 --> 11:12.314
A new scepter must be created
to celebrate the occasion.

11:13.324 --> 11:16.851
Behold, the Hall of Scepters.

11:19.563 --> 11:20.655
(EX CLAIMS IN AWE)

11:20.764 --> 11:24.393
- They're beautiful.
- Every scepter is unique.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.202
Some are the work of animal fairies,

11:27.304 --> 11:30.967
some of light fairies, or water fairies,
or garden fairies.

11:31.408 --> 11:35.003
This year,
it is the turn of the tinker fairies.

11:35.646 --> 11:38.513
And Fairy Mary has recommended you.

11:38.949 --> 11:39.938
(GASPS)

11:40.050 --> 11:45.147
- Me? But I'm... I'm...
- A very talented tinker.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.851
The scepter must be built
to precise dimensions.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.725
At the top, you will place a moonstone.

11:55.065 --> 11:57.363
When the blue moon is at its peak,

11:57.468 --> 12:02.667
its rays will pass through the gem,
creating blue pixie dust.

12:03.507 --> 12:07.102
QUEEN CLARION: The blue pixie dust
restores the pixie dust tree.

12:07.578 --> 12:11.947
Like autumn itself,
it signals rebirth and rejuvenation.

12:12.483 --> 12:14.508
We are relying on you.

12:15.786 --> 12:17.276
This way, dear.

12:19.089 --> 12:21.421
Here is the moonstone.

12:22.593 --> 12:26.029
It has been handed down
from generation to generation.

12:27.831 --> 12:31.358
Be careful. It is ridiculously fragile.

12:32.036 --> 12:35.631
Fairy Mary, I... I don't know what to say.

12:36.674 --> 12:39.370
- Thank you!
- Careful, Tinker Bell! Fragile!

12:39.476 --> 12:42.877
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

12:43.714 --> 12:44.840
(SIGHS)

12:44.949 --> 12:48.885
- Why are you counting?
- It helps to calm me down.

12:50.087 --> 12:54.490
Got it. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
I'll make you proud, all of you.

12:58.228 --> 12:59.957
Yahoo!

TERENCE: Tink!

13:07.404 --> 13:08.462
Tink?

13:10.607 --> 13:11.631
Hey!

13:16.780 --> 13:17.747
So?

13:17.848 --> 13:19.440
Terence, you're never
gonna believe this.

13:19.550 --> 13:22.383
Guess what happened! Go on, guess!

13:23.020 --> 13:24.009
Well, I...

13:24.121 --> 13:27.284
I have been picked
to make the new fall scepter!

13:27.791 --> 13:29.452
Me! Me!

13:30.527 --> 13:33.257
Hey, that means they...
They gave you the moonstone?

13:33.364 --> 13:34.922
Yeah! Want to see?

13:39.536 --> 13:40.525
(WHISTLES)

13:40.637 --> 13:44.164
Not so close. Don't breathe on it.
It's fragile.

13:44.708 --> 13:47.108
Yeah, I know. I know all about it.

13:47.277 --> 13:50.804
The blue moon only rises
in Pixie Hollow every eight years.

13:50.914 --> 13:53.940
The trajectory of the light beam's gotta
match the curvature of the moonstone

13:54.051 --> 13:55.450
at a 90-degree angle

13:55.552 --> 13:57.543
so the light can transmute
into pixie dust.

13:57.654 --> 14:00.782
Wow, Terence!
Now, how'd you know all that?

14:01.592 --> 14:05.084
Well, you know, every dust-keeper's
gotta study dustology.

14:05.195 --> 14:07.026
Hey! You know what this calls for?

14:07.131 --> 14:08.996
- Two cups of...
- Chamomile tea.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.363
- With extra honey and...
- And some milkweed whip.

14:11.468 --> 14:12.730
(GIGGLES)

14:12.970 --> 14:16.371
Hey, by the way, that new
bucket-and-pulley system you made?

14:16.473 --> 14:18.202
Fairy Gary loves it.

14:18.409 --> 14:20.969
- He's so cute.
- Lf you say so.

14:21.845 --> 14:26.111
You know what? Maybe I can help you.
You know, I'm kind of an expert on this.

14:26.216 --> 14:29.242
I can collect the supplies
and give you advice.

14:29.787 --> 14:34.281
- You will? That's... That's so sweet.
- Hey, what are friends for?

14:34.858 --> 14:37.486
So, what do you say?
Can I be your wingman?

14:37.594 --> 14:38.959
That would be great.

14:39.063 --> 14:41.623
- The best dust-keeper fairy.
- And the best tinker!

14:41.732 --> 14:43.996
This is gonna be
a revelry to remember.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.339
TERENCE: Knock-knock.

14:53.343 --> 14:54.537
(YAWNS)

14:55.045 --> 14:57.411
- Morning.
- Hi.

14:58.248 --> 15:03.208
All right, we have one full moon
until the autumn revelry. Here we go.

15:05.889 --> 15:08.687
Hey, Tink!
I brought you some stuff from work.

15:08.792 --> 15:09.850
Whoa.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.654
Wow, Terence, how did you...

15:12.763 --> 15:13.730
(SQUEAKING)

15:15.332 --> 15:17.197
I love this thing!

15:17.301 --> 15:19.895
I can tell you're gonna be a big help.

15:21.038 --> 15:22.096
TERENCE: Looks good.

15:22.206 --> 15:24.265
Now, remember,
you get the most blue pixie dust

15:24.374 --> 15:27.309

- How about a stick?

- A stick can be pretty sharp!

I mean, I have to ask you...

25:10.994 --> 25:12.552
Yes?

25:13.329 --> 25:14.591
It's about the moonstone.

25:14.698 --> 25:18.691
What happened to it? You didn't lose it.
Tell me you didn't lose it!

25:18.802 --> 25:21.430
- I didn't lose it.
- Good.

25:21.538 --> 25:25.440
But I was thinking, if using one
moonstone creates blue pixie dust,

25:25.542 --> 25:27.908
using two would create even more.

25:28.545 --> 25:30.012
Do you have another moonstone?

25:30.113 --> 25:34.277
That moonstone is the only one found
in the last 100 years.

25:34.718 --> 25:36.481
And thank goodness we found it.

25:36.586 --> 25:40.044
Without the blue dust,
the pixie dust tree would grow weak,

31:58.935 --> 32:01.563
Tinker Bell,
we need every bit of it on the mainland.

32:01.671 --> 32:05.004
Sweetie, it takes a lot of flying
to bring in autumn.

32:05.875 --> 32:07.240
Sorry, Tink.

32:09.545 --> 32:11.672
Say, you know who can help.

32:16.586 --> 32:20.215
Raffaela, Renato, Redina, Rina...

32:20.990 --> 32:22.514
- Hi, Cheese!
- Hey, Terence!

32:22.625 --> 32:24.092
Morning, Fawn!

32:24.494 --> 32:27.258
- Rina, Rhoda, Rosetta...
- Terence.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.429
- Tink?
- Hi.

32:31.801 --> 32:34.929
Surprised to see you.
How's the scepter?

32:35.671 --> 32:37.605
I'm working on it.

32:38.207 --> 32:41.904
Look, Terence, things happened,
mistakes were made,

32:42.011 --> 32:45.412
and now there's something
I need to talk to you about.

32:46.782 --> 32:48.943
I need some extra pixie dust.

32:50.786 --> 32:53.914
You need more pixie dust?
That's why you're here?

32:54.123 --> 32:55.215
Yeah.

32:55.324 --> 32:59.090
It's not exactly what I was expecting.
Why do you need more dust?

32:59.195 --> 33:01.891
I... I can't tell you.

33:02.598 --> 33:03.997
You can't tell me?

33:04.100 --> 33:07.331
You need more pixie dust,
and you can't tell me why?

33:07.436 --> 33:10.132
A true friend
wouldn't need to know why.

33:10.373 --> 33:13.308
A true friend wouldn't ask me
to break the rules!

33:13.409 --> 33:16.207
Well, then,
I guess we're not true friends!

33:19.549 --> 33:20.743
No, I...

33:22.919 --> 33:24.546
I guess we're not.

33:25.054 --> 33:26.783
I'm on my own, then.

38:05.034 --> 38:06.797
I'm on a very important mission.

38:06.902 --> 38:10.167
I have two days to find the magic mirror
and wish the moonstone back.

38:10.272 --> 38:11.239

39:32.121 --> 39:34.646
All right. You can stay.

39:36.058 --> 39:41.587
For now. Just do me a favor,
if you could stay right here.

39:43.499 --> 39:46.764
If my bearings are accurate,
we should see land soon.

39:48.070 --> 39:50.834

39:52.041 --> 39:54.009
Okay. Blinky?

am I supposed to guess your name

Your name's Bellows?

Okay. Next.

how are those lanterns coming?

40:29.845 --> 40:33.941
Almost done, Fairy Mary. Whoa!
Good shot, Cheese.

40:34.516 --> 40:37.178
Next, I'll get Rosetta some light crystals
for the fireworks.

We should've seen land by now.

You go ahead and get some rest.
I'll take first watch.

In a tree?

This must be the lost island.

42:49.651 --> 42:52.449

The stone arch from the story!

42:52.921 --> 42:55.412

- What?

to make bread out of bones?

by the wind,

a mirror that grants one last wish,

52:10.145 --> 52:11.169

52:11.279 --> 52:13.110

finding me a sharp thingy

52:13.214 --> 52:14.909
instead of making me
break the moonstone.

52:15.016 --> 52:17.041
And then he didn't even share
his pixie dust because he cares more

52:17.152 --> 52:18.881
about the stupid rules
than he does about me...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

- Is he a friend of yours?

52:24.559 --> 52:25.890
Well, yeah.

52:27.429 --> 52:29.260
He was my best friend.

52:30.365 --> 52:33.425
- You're not very nice.
- Hey, don't you judge me!

52:33.535 --> 52:36.766
You've been yelling at each other
since I got here.

52:36.905 --> 52:38.839
But he knows I don't mean it, don't you?

- Like when I call you "wart face."
- Yes. Or when I call you "big nose."

- Booger breath.
- Stinky feet.

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:18.389
All right, everyone.
To the pixie-dust tree!

01:10:26.401 --> 01:10:27.891
That's our cue!

01:10:28.003 --> 01:10:29.368
(WHISTLING)

01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:37.870
There are the bubbles. Hit it, Clank.

01:10:41.783 --> 01:10:44.513
It worked, Bobble! It worked!

01:10:45.153 --> 01:10:47.280
Aye, it certainly did.

01:10:52.361 --> 01:10:56.491
<i>(SINGING) To believe in who you are</i>

01:10:56.899 --> 01:11:01.393
<i>Who you were always meant to be</i>

01:11:02.337 --> 01:11:06.239
<i>To you open up your heart</i>

01:11:06.842 --> 01:11:11.006
<i>Then you set your spirit free</i>

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:16.040
<i>In this time of the season</i>

01:11:16.351 --> 01:11:20.583
<i>Every leaf on every tree</i>

01:11:21.123 --> 01:11:23.318
<i>Start to shine</i>

01:11:23.625 --> 01:11:25.684
<i>Come and see</i>

01:11:25.894 --> 01:11:28.089
<i>Take my hand</i>

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:30.127
<i>Come with me</i>

01:11:30.265 --> 01:11:35.669
<i>And fly</i>

01:11:40.676 --> 01:11:43.372
<i>NARRATOR: "The greatest treasures
are not gold</i>

01:11:43.478 --> 01:11:46.038
<i>"Nor jewels, nor works of art</i>

01:11:46.481 --> 01:11:51.282
<i>"They cannot be held in your hands
They're held within your heart</i>

01:11:52.187 --> 01:11:57.386
<i>"For worldly things will fade away
as seasons come and go</i>

01:11:58.093 --> 01:12:03.554
<i>"But the treasure of true friendship
will never lose its glow"</i>

01:12:27.356 --> 01:12:31.349
<i>(SINGING) Sometimes you think
you'll be fine by yourself</i>

01:12:31.727 --> 01:12:36.289
<i>'Cause a dream
is a wish that you make all alone</i>

01:12:36.698 --> 01:12:40.930
<i>It's easy to feel like you don't need help</i>

01:12:41.169 --> 01:12:45.071
<i>But it's harder to walk on your own</i>

01:12:45.707 --> 01:12:49.905
<i>You'll change inside</i>

01:12:50.379 --> 01:12:54.213
<i>When you realize</i>

01:12:54.349 --> 01:12:56.647
<i>The world comes to life</i>

01:12:56.752 --> 01:12:59.414
<i>And everything's all right</i>

01:12:59.554 --> 01:13:02.216
<i>From beginning to end</i>

01:13:02.324 --> 01:13:05.953
<i>When you have a friend
by your side</i>

01:13:06.061 --> 01:13:08.757
<i>That helps you to find</i>

01:13:09.564 --> 01:13:13.625
<i>The beauty you are
when you open your heart</i>

01:13:13.735 --> 01:13:16.829
<i>And believe in</i>

01:13:17.873 --> 01:13:20.899
<i>The gift of a friend</i>

01:13:22.611 --> 01:13:26.274
<i>The gift of a friend</i>

01:13:28.683 --> 01:13:32.983
<i>Someone who knows
when your lost and you're scared</i>

01:13:33.388 --> 01:13:37.324
<i>There through
the highs and the lows</i>

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:42.326
<i>Someone to count on
Someone who cares</i>

01:13:42.431 --> 01:13:46.333
<i>Beside you wherever you'll go</i>

01:13:46.935 --> 01:13:51.201
<i>You'll change inside</i>

<i>From beginning to end</i>

01:14:03.418 --> 01:14:07.149

<i>The gift of a friend</i>

01:14:25.207 --> 01:14:29.837
<i>And when your hope crashes down
Shattering to the ground</i>

01:14:29.945 --> 01:14:33.210
<i>You'll feel all alone</i>

01:14:33.748 --> 01:14:36.842
<i>When you don't know which way to go</i>

01:14:36.952 --> 01:14:40.649
<i>And there's no signs leading you on</i>

01:14:42.891 --> 01:14:45.985
<i>You're not alone</i>

01:14:47.429 --> 01:14:49.556
<i>The world comes to life</i>

<i>From beginning to end</i>

01:14:55.303 --> 01:14:57.294
<i>When you have a friend</i>

01:14:57.405 --> 01:14:59.066
<i>By your side</i>

01:14:59.174 --> 01:15:02.200
<i>That helps you to find</i>

01:15:02.511 --> 01:15:06.709
<i>The beauty you are
when you open your heart</i>

01:15:06.815 --> 01:15:10.148
<i>You believe in</i>

<i>The gift of a friend</i>

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:57.796
<i>Where the sunbeams play
in the highland glade</i>

01:15:58.166 --> 01:16:02.398
<i>Where the leaves are gently falling</i>

01:16:03.305 --> 01:16:09.244
<i>Where we used to dance
in the autumn shade</i>

01:16:09.778 --> 01:16:14.806
<i>My foolish pride drove you away</i>

01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:20.989
<i>Where the storm clouds rose
and the cold winds blew</i>

01:16:21.156 --> 01:16:25.525
<i>Oh, I could not hear you calling</i>

01:16:26.294 --> 01:16:32.290
<i>Till you took my hand
and you pulled me through</i>

01:16:32.968 --> 01:16:37.268
<i>To where the sunbeams play</i>

01:16:37.906 --> 01:16:43.173
<i>To ride with you
upon the wind</i>

01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:48.448
<i>To fly above the sea</i>

01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:54.147
<i>To be far and wide
of Neverland</i>

01:16:54.322 --> 01:16:57.450
<i>I would dare to go</i>

01:16:57.559 --> 01:17:00.460
<i>If you would go with me</i>

01:17:00.829 --> 01:17:07.064
<i>Now the wind blows our love
against our day</i>

01:17:07.168 --> 01:17:12.265
<i>And the dark of night is falling</i>

01:17:12.907 --> 01:17:16.001
<i>But if you're with me</i>

01:17:16.144 --> 01:17:19.978
<i>We will find our way</i>

01:17:20.482 --> 01:17:26.318

To where the sunbeams</i>

<i>To where the sunbeams dance</i>

01:17:31.459 --> 01:17:37.398
<i>And play</i>
