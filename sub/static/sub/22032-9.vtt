( Crowd murmuring )

02:16.027 --> 02:19.130
Sir, it looks like a suicide note.

02:21.934 --> 02:25.134
Did anyone see Ensign Norwich last night?

02:25.169 --> 02:27.406
I saw him in the tavern at suppertime, sir.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.475
He had sentry duty last night
in front of the garrison.

02:30.509 --> 02:32.710
No one saw him saddle a horse,

02:32.744 --> 02:35.981
throw a rope over the gallows
and attach himself to it

02:36.015 --> 02:39.583
not 30 feet from where you
lay snoring in your tents?

02:39.617 --> 02:41.117
It was a dark night, sir.

02:41.152 --> 02:43.587
A dark night breeds dark thoughts.

02:43.621 --> 02:46.254
As I recall, the poor man always did suffer

02:46.288 --> 02:47.821
from a melancholic temperament.

02:47.856 --> 02:49.222
( Men snickering )

02:49.256 --> 02:53.223

02:53.257 --> 02:55.558
<i>or for that matter disturbed, Captain.</i>

02:55.592 --> 02:58.763
Oh, but I am. Disturbed.

02:58.797 --> 03:01.531
I just hope his despair isn't contagious.

03:01.566 --> 03:03.999
<i>There's so few of you as it is.</i>

03:05.534 --> 03:07.969

<i>( Woman gasps )</i>

03:22.725 --> 03:25.828
ã2 and four shillings.

03:25.862 --> 03:29.667
I had ã4, 12 shillings in my
pocket when I was arrested.

03:29.702 --> 03:32.135
Major Hewlett will be expecting
an accurate accounting

03:32.169 --> 03:34.339
of my expenses upon my return.

03:34.373 --> 03:37.508
Then as a gesture of good faith,

03:37.542 --> 03:39.879
I'll make up the balance.

03:39.913 --> 03:42.081
Out of my own pocket, mind you.

03:42.115 --> 03:44.115
Where it went to begin with.

03:51.058 --> 03:54.630
A good bit of luck, your major escaping

03:54.664 --> 03:58.434
when we were this close to hanging you.

04:01.269 --> 04:04.335
Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Yates.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.333
I won't forget you.

04:11.340 --> 04:13.174
<i>( Door closes )</i>

04:23.514 --> 04:25.650
Mind your eyes, child. Come.

04:33.993 --> 04:36.862
I'd been after Townsend for
months to sell the place.

04:36.897 --> 04:39.266
Not a flicker of interest.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.968
Then out of the blue, he tracks me down

04:42.002 --> 04:43.870
and offers to sell it on the spot.

04:43.904 --> 04:45.438
Ha, set his price

04:45.473 --> 04:47.440
and gives me all of a
minute to think it over.

04:47.474 --> 04:49.644
- And you haven't heard from him since?
- Not a peep.

04:49.679 --> 04:51.647
And I have no idea where to find him either.

04:51.682 --> 04:54.216
- You sure he didn't leave word?
- What's the name again?

04:54.251 --> 04:55.785
Woodhull. Abraham Woodhull.

04:55.819 --> 04:57.153
Oh, yes.

04:57.188 --> 04:59.655
Well, he didn't leave word,

04:59.689 --> 05:03.060
but he did leave this.

05:09.235 --> 05:11.873
- My bill.
- Look at the bright side.

05:11.907 --> 05:14.775
If you don't know where he is, you
can't very well pay him, can you?

05:14.810 --> 05:17.441
Will this get me a room
long enough to clean up?

05:17.475 --> 05:19.575
I'll even throw in a razor.

05:54.214 --> 05:56.851
Mrs. Strong, might I have a word?

05:56.885 --> 05:59.555
It regards a matter that concerns you.

05:59.589 --> 06:02.457
Since it presumably does not concern me,

06:02.492 --> 06:05.295
I will find somewhere quieter to read.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.237
Have I offended him in some way?

06:11.271 --> 06:13.904
Not you, me.

06:13.938 --> 06:16.808
By my very presence.

06:17.943 --> 06:19.376
Richard has never gotten over the...

06:21.880 --> 06:25.183
enmity he bore my family.

06:25.218 --> 06:29.253
Sins of the father shall not
be visited upon his children.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.595
Which reminds me,

06:33.630 --> 06:38.432
I have received another
communication from Major André

06:38.466 --> 06:41.336
concerning your ward Cicero.

06:42.473 --> 06:44.174
Another gift from his mother?

06:44.209 --> 06:46.914
No, he wants the boy to
join them in New York

06:46.948 --> 06:49.486
when they return from Philadelphia.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.722
I've written him repeatedly about Simcoe

06:51.757 --> 06:55.361
and all I receive in return is a
letter concerning a slave boy.

06:56.530 --> 06:58.362
What's wrong?

07:00.267 --> 07:01.837
( Crying )

07:01.871 --> 07:04.875
It will be wonderful
for them to be reunited.

07:04.910 --> 07:07.510
Yes, of course.

07:07.545 --> 07:10.713
Unfortunately, due to the
present situation in town,

07:10.748 --> 07:14.721
I cannot spare any men to accompany the boy.

07:16.657 --> 07:19.225
Does this situation

07:19.259 --> 07:21.559
have something to do with the suicide?

07:25.098 --> 07:27.463
It wasn't a suicide, was it?

07:28.867 --> 07:31.137
Simcoe.

07:31.171 --> 07:33.772
It was Simcoe.

07:34.775 --> 07:36.977
Apparently he wasn't content

07:37.012 --> 07:40.445
with engineering my
capture and imprisonment.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.481
I knew it.

07:43.751 --> 07:45.552
I felt it.

07:48.390 --> 07:50.592
The way his men laughed.

07:50.626 --> 07:53.760
He seems to treat violence like a game.

07:54.961 --> 07:58.834
And now he's trying to goad me

07:58.869 --> 08:00.736
into open war.

08:02.736 --> 08:05.971
If it is a game,

08:06.006 --> 08:08.341
perhaps it's one you can beat him at.

08:10.676 --> 08:13.845
What if I could find a way to
get Cicero safely to New York

08:13.879 --> 08:17.950
and also take one of Simcoe's
key players off the board?

08:25.589 --> 08:27.721
( Bangs )

08:40.337 --> 08:42.403
- Miss Anna!
- Cicero.

08:42.437 --> 08:44.070
- How are you? Are you all right?
- Yes.

08:44.104 --> 08:47.009
Is DeJong working you too hard?

08:47.044 --> 08:48.879
Just usual.

08:48.914 --> 08:51.515
I've been lighting that candle
every night just like you said.

08:51.549 --> 08:53.685
Thank you.

08:53.719 --> 08:56.352
I, uh... I have news.

08:56.386 --> 08:58.821
Your mother's employer, Major André,

08:58.856 --> 09:02.627
wants you to join them in New York.

09:02.661 --> 09:04.294
That's right.

09:05.863 --> 09:08.297
It's so good to see you, Jordan.

09:08.331 --> 09:10.198
Akinbode.

09:10.232 --> 09:12.533
I ain't your slave no more,

09:12.568 --> 09:14.401
so don't call me by my slave name.

09:14.436 --> 09:16.571
She didn't mean anything by it, Jordan.

09:16.605 --> 09:20.042
I mean, A... Akin...

09:20.077 --> 09:22.979
Akinbode. It's all right,
boy. It's all right.

09:24.449 --> 09:26.351
Akinbode.

09:27.854 --> 09:30.389
I'm sorry if I offended you.

09:30.423 --> 09:32.858
I realize I have no right

09:32.892 --> 09:35.896
to presume a friendship between us,

09:35.930 --> 09:38.863
but I need to ask a favor from you.

09:38.898 --> 09:43.238
<i>Cicero has the chance to be with his mother,</i>

09:43.273 --> 09:46.841
but Major Hewlett can't spare any
soldiers to take him to New York.

09:46.876 --> 09:49.408
- So I thought...
- You see this?

09:49.442 --> 09:51.746
You see this, hmm?

09:51.780 --> 09:54.885
Captain Simcoe can't spare me neither.

09:54.919 --> 09:57.154
Counts on me to keep the men in line.

09:58.690 --> 10:01.393
Could you at least ask him?

10:01.427 --> 10:04.865
There's no one else I'd
trust with Cicero's safety.

10:04.899 --> 10:07.333
And I'm sure his mother

10:07.368 --> 10:09.635
would be very grateful as well.

10:09.670 --> 10:10.904
That's right.

10:10.939 --> 10:12.808
<i>And you like her, too, Jordan.</i>

10:12.843 --> 10:15.579
<i>I mean, Akin...</i>

10:15.613 --> 10:17.413
Akinbo...

10:17.447 --> 10:20.383
He's gonna say no.

10:20.417 --> 10:22.520
But I'll try.

10:23.489 --> 10:25.491
That's all I ask.

10:25.525 --> 10:26.927
Thank you.

10:29.321 --> 10:37.773
__

10:40.510 --> 10:42.811
Whoa!

10:43.780 --> 10:45.581
( Grunts )

10:47.747 --> 10:49.214
Here you go. Thank you.

10:49.248 --> 10:52.585
- Here you go.
- Ho, hup. Hyah!

10:55.986 --> 10:59.087
Man: Sand both sides of the burr.

11:08.364 --> 11:10.296
- Is this Samuel Townsend's place?
- Yes, sir.

11:10.331 --> 11:11.829
Samuel: <i>Abraham!</i>

11:11.864 --> 11:14.430
( chuckles ) Oh!

11:14.465 --> 11:17.599
Oh, it is so good to see you.

11:18.834 --> 11:21.336
Well, as much as I can see you. ( chuckles )

11:21.370 --> 11:23.571
- Looks nasty.
- Oh, yes.

11:23.605 --> 11:26.441
- Are you all right?
- A doctor tells me it's better than it was.

11:26.475 --> 11:30.146
The corollary alas being it
still feels worse than it is.

11:32.582 --> 11:34.916
What happened here?

11:34.951 --> 11:37.286
The war, Abraham.

11:37.320 --> 11:41.125
In all its petty ugliness
and incidental brutality.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.126
Soldiers did this?

11:43.161 --> 11:46.095
A band of jolly fellows in forest green.

11:46.130 --> 11:47.964
They burst in a couple of weeks back

11:47.998 --> 11:51.835
demanding fresh horses to
replace their sick nags.

11:51.870 --> 11:55.238
And when I had the temerity
to ask for payment,

11:55.272 --> 11:58.803
they laughed and then
they torched my stables

11:58.838 --> 12:00.974
to bring the lesson home.

12:01.009 --> 12:03.247
And therein

12:03.281 --> 12:06.681
this sad affair finds its silver lining.

12:06.716 --> 12:09.518
Robert? Robert saw this?

12:09.552 --> 12:11.621
( laughing ) Yes. Yes.

12:11.656 --> 12:15.258
And it lit a fire in him that made
this one seem a feeble candle.

12:15.293 --> 12:20.095
He left saying he was going to
find Woodhull and get justice.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.763
Well, he...

12:21.798 --> 12:24.868
he never came to visit me
while I was in prison.

12:24.902 --> 12:28.569
Well, he said he was going to send you
a message that only you can read.

12:34.344 --> 12:37.743
He used the ink. He used the ink.

12:38.678 --> 12:39.912
( Chuckles ) Oh, Robert.

12:39.946 --> 12:41.215
Well, all right, how do we read it?

12:41.249 --> 12:44.419
No, I have to get back to
my farm, apply a reagent.

12:44.453 --> 12:46.187
Thank you, Samuel.

12:47.422 --> 12:50.491
Before you go, ahem,

12:50.525 --> 12:52.894
let me ask you a favor.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.268
Look after Robert.

12:56.302 --> 13:00.407
We both encouraged him to
take this plunge, but...

13:00.441 --> 13:03.943
( chuckles nervously ) ...he's my only son.

13:03.977 --> 13:08.717
And somewhat selfishly, I suppose,

13:08.752 --> 13:11.452
I can't imagine my life
going on without him.

13:15.227 --> 13:17.929
I'll do my best to protect him, I promise.

13:26.618 --> 13:32.839
__

13:36.130 --> 13:40.496
Well, I think that William has
grown into a fine young man.

13:40.531 --> 13:43.935
He could make someone an excellent husband.

13:43.969 --> 13:47.775
Someone, perhaps,
who is not his first cousin.

13:47.810 --> 13:50.947
Oh, what better evidence of character

13:50.981 --> 13:54.151
than someone you've known and grown up with?

13:54.186 --> 13:58.157
Far better than some military adventurer.

13:58.191 --> 14:01.462
It's a shame, so many of the best families

14:01.497 --> 14:04.699
<i>deserting us for New York now
that the rebels have taken over.</i>

14:04.733 --> 14:07.202
I hope you're not considering
it, Judge Shippen.

14:07.236 --> 14:08.670
Of course not.

14:08.704 --> 14:10.506
<i>I'll not abandon my house again</i>

14:10.541 --> 14:12.408
just because some rabble...

14:12.442 --> 14:14.879
- <i>( crowd shouting )</i>
- <i>( Horse neighs )</i>

14:14.914 --> 14:16.248
Oh, God.

14:16.282 --> 14:19.985
- ( Shouting continues )
- Man: Tory scum!

14:21.421 --> 14:23.226
( Banging ) Charles!

14:23.260 --> 14:24.828
Charles, turn us around!

14:24.862 --> 14:26.898
( Shouting continues )

14:29.805 --> 14:31.972
( shouts ) Traitors!

14:32.007 --> 14:35.176
- What do they want?
- Us, it seems.

14:36.313 --> 14:38.248
( Horse neighs )

14:38.283 --> 14:39.950
( shouting continues )

14:49.093 --> 14:50.827
You there, away from the carriage.

14:50.861 --> 14:52.028
Disperse.

14:52.063 --> 14:54.130
- Back away from the coach!
- You, get down.

14:54.164 --> 14:56.232
( Screams )

14:56.266 --> 14:59.637
There is to be no destruction of property

14:59.671 --> 15:03.905
or any threat against any
citizen of Philadelphia

15:03.939 --> 15:07.714
<i>by my orders as military commandant.</i>

15:09.516 --> 15:12.620
We are better than them.

15:12.654 --> 15:14.420
If your blood is up,

15:14.455 --> 15:16.756
then pour that feeling into a celebration

15:16.790 --> 15:18.625
of our great victory.

15:18.660 --> 15:21.294
A celebration of America!

15:21.329 --> 15:23.896
( Cheering )

15:30.206 --> 15:31.973
Mr. Shippen.

15:32.007 --> 15:35.045
Major General Benedict
Arnold at your service, sir.

15:35.079 --> 15:38.746
<i>You once graciously hosted me at your table.</i>

15:38.781 --> 15:41.752
I... oh, yes. I remember.

15:41.787 --> 15:45.320
If you'll allow, sir, I will personally
see you safely into your home.

15:45.354 --> 15:46.988
Why, I thank you, sir.

15:47.022 --> 15:49.693
Your daughter Margaret, I presume.

15:49.728 --> 15:51.462
<i>Even lovelier than I recall.</i>

15:52.764 --> 15:54.096
General.

15:54.131 --> 15:57.434
Delighted to make your
acquaintance again, Miss Shippen.

16:02.544 --> 16:07.253
__

16:07.253 --> 16:10.013
Shoulder. Firelocks.

16:10.047 --> 16:12.083
Poise.

16:12.118 --> 16:14.320
Take aim.

16:14.355 --> 16:16.089
Remember, aim as one.

16:16.123 --> 16:17.956
Fire as one.

16:17.991 --> 16:20.093
<i>See them run.</i>

16:20.128 --> 16:21.495
- Fire.
- ( Guns click )

16:21.529 --> 16:24.397
Half-cock firelocks. Handle...

16:24.432 --> 16:26.434
Bradford: <i>Our latest
reports put Clinton here</i>

16:26.468 --> 16:29.036
on the road between
Haddonfield and Mount Holly.

16:29.070 --> 16:31.637
Some 10,000 men, 1,500 wagons

16:31.671 --> 16:33.639
strung out for miles along a single road

16:33.673 --> 16:35.508
to avoid being picked off by our marksmen.

16:35.542 --> 16:38.042
It gives us a remarkable opportunity.

16:38.076 --> 16:41.548
- So you suggest we attack?
- Yes, sir.

16:41.582 --> 16:43.917
We don't even have to engage the main army.

16:43.951 --> 16:45.685
Just bloody their rear enough to slow them,

16:45.719 --> 16:48.187
let the French fleet cut
them off before New York.

16:48.222 --> 16:50.192
Then we squeeze the bastards
till they beg for mercy.

16:50.226 --> 16:53.463
Language, Mr. Bradford.

16:53.498 --> 16:56.966
Gentlemen do not curse.
At least in this army.

16:59.337 --> 17:02.340
Your man seems hot to engage, General.

17:02.375 --> 17:05.342
Surprising given that you
yourself have always been

17:05.376 --> 17:07.344
the voice of caution in these councils.

17:07.377 --> 17:10.945
Are you truly of the same mind?

17:10.980 --> 17:14.147
Your suspicion is warranted, sir.

17:14.182 --> 17:16.915
Too often I have urged restraint,

17:16.950 --> 17:21.017
forgetting that the risk of inaction
can outweigh that of defeat.

17:21.050 --> 17:25.018
<i>Allow me to say, sir, that I
have learned from your boldness.</i>

17:25.051 --> 17:27.684
At Trenton, at Princeton,

17:27.719 --> 17:30.352
and even more so here at Valley Forge.

17:30.387 --> 17:33.622
We fought no battles at
Valley Forge to my recollection.

17:33.657 --> 17:36.394
On the contrary, sir.

17:36.429 --> 17:39.867
You fought the greatest battle of all.

17:39.901 --> 17:43.403
Preserving this army through its dark winter

17:43.437 --> 17:46.072
so that we might now have this chance

17:46.107 --> 17:49.111
to take the fight to the enemy.

17:49.145 --> 17:52.379
<i>For that reason,</i>

17:52.413 --> 17:55.147
I owe you my humble respect

17:55.182 --> 17:58.115
and an apology

17:58.149 --> 18:00.719
for ever doubting your leadership.

18:05.857 --> 18:08.591
<i>( Chopping wood )</i>

18:20.702 --> 18:22.001
( whispering )

18:24.072 --> 18:26.008
Sir.

18:26.042 --> 18:29.442
I'm sorry, sir. He won't see you.

18:29.477 --> 18:32.477
Does he still hold me in such contempt

18:32.512 --> 18:34.377
he won't even meet my eye?

18:35.946 --> 18:37.881
Wait.

18:39.749 --> 18:43.152
I never done this before,
talk behind his back,

18:43.187 --> 18:45.721
but he been through some rough
times and I worry about him.

18:45.756 --> 18:47.589
Well, what is it, Billy?

18:47.623 --> 18:52.832
The general, he just gave
General Lee half the army.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.632
Gonna go attack the
redcoats while they retreat.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.497
Half the army? Are you sure?

18:56.532 --> 18:59.569
Didn't hear it with my own ears,
I wouldn't have believed it myself.

18:59.603 --> 19:02.538
I know you don't trust that
man, and I don't neither.

19:02.573 --> 19:06.407
But the general, I think he
was fooled by his apology.

19:06.441 --> 19:09.410
Lee apologized?

19:11.814 --> 19:13.817
You were right to tell me this, Billy.

19:13.852 --> 19:16.653
But whatever you do, don't tell anyone else.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.539
- Whoa.
- Here you go.

19:31.573 --> 19:33.172
Thanks.

19:35.642 --> 19:36.909
- Right.
- So long.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.578
Move on.

20:01.897 --> 20:04.134
Eastin: <i>You, halt!</i>

20:04.169 --> 20:07.369
Woodhull?

20:07.403 --> 20:09.403
Mr. Eastin.

20:09.437 --> 20:11.538
You gentlemen out for a nice afternoon ride?

20:11.572 --> 20:13.238
The major told me to
keep an eye out for you.

20:13.273 --> 20:16.008
- Ah.
- Seems he still has me doing the same job.

20:16.042 --> 20:18.177
Well, practice makes perfect.

20:18.212 --> 20:19.646
You think that's funny?

20:19.681 --> 20:21.416
<i>I didn't think it as funny</i>

20:21.450 --> 20:25.086
<i>when I found myself waiting
for days in Brooklyn</i>

20:25.121 --> 20:28.625
only to learn that you'd been
thrown in jail for spying.

20:28.660 --> 20:31.528
Now, instead of going straight
home, you've come here.

20:31.562 --> 20:33.230
Why?

20:33.264 --> 20:34.966
Well, I'm thinking of rebuilding,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.568
but it's none of your business.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.271
Unless I make it my business.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.440
( Horse neighs, snorts )

20:40.475 --> 20:41.942
Simcoe: Woodhull.

20:41.976 --> 20:43.344
Welcome home.

20:43.378 --> 20:46.212
Is Eastin here giving you any trouble?

20:46.246 --> 20:49.413
Not at all. We're just about
to escort Mr. Woodhull home.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.847
Why don't we accompany each other?

20:50.881 --> 20:52.248
I think I can manage to
make it home by myself.

20:52.282 --> 20:53.683
Maclnnis, give the man your horse.

20:59.020 --> 21:01.054
Captain, I never had the chance

21:01.088 --> 21:02.990
to properly welcome you back to Setauket.

21:03.024 --> 21:04.725
If you ever have an opening in your ranks...

21:04.759 --> 21:06.527
You've chosen your side.

21:06.561 --> 21:10.100
You're Hewlett's man now
and bound to his fate.

21:38.897 --> 21:40.299
Simcoe: Here he is.

21:40.334 --> 21:44.303
The prodigal returns safely
to the bosom of his family.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.404
Abraham.

21:49.545 --> 21:52.380
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

21:52.414 --> 21:54.016
<i>( Abraham murmurs )</i>

22:06.300 --> 22:08.302
Say hi to your dad.

22:09.804 --> 22:11.671
Hi, Sprout.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.141
All right.

22:24.081 --> 22:25.813
Wait.

23:03.482 --> 23:06.421
<i>( Chatter )</i>

23:09.365 --> 23:13.608
Tell Lafayette we need his
battalions ready to march by 4:00.

23:13.643 --> 23:16.076
Wayne is to follow two hours later.

23:16.110 --> 23:18.212
Meet us at Coryell's Ferry.

23:22.854 --> 23:24.388
So you wish to serve under General Lee?

23:24.422 --> 23:26.696
I do. And I have four troops of dragoons

23:26.696 --> 23:29.128
provisioned and ready to ride.

23:29.162 --> 23:30.396
I thought you were Washington's man.

23:30.430 --> 23:33.099
Was his man, but now yours leads the fight

23:33.134 --> 23:34.703
and Washington brings up the rear.

23:34.738 --> 23:36.837
By the time he arrives, you
may well have won the day.

23:36.871 --> 23:40.503
I always figured you for
a glory hound, Tallmadge.

23:40.537 --> 23:42.737
Just like that fool Arnold.

23:42.772 --> 23:46.774
Look, I know we've had our
differences in the past, Bradford,

23:46.808 --> 23:49.508
and I apologize for any disrespect

23:49.543 --> 23:52.312
I may have shown to you or to General Lee.

23:52.346 --> 23:54.216
Now we can put that behind us

23:54.250 --> 23:57.086
and band together to fight the real enemy...

23:57.121 --> 23:58.620
King George's footmen.

23:58.655 --> 24:01.591
Now I know you have plenty
of infantry and cannon,

24:01.625 --> 24:03.026
but hardly any horse.

24:03.060 --> 24:05.230
My dragoons can be anywhere on
the battlefield they're needed,

24:05.264 --> 24:07.465
whether it's to harass Clinton's flanks

24:07.499 --> 24:08.864
or to punch holes through his lines.

24:08.899 --> 24:10.533
And we're damn good scouts as well.

24:12.271 --> 24:15.575
You'll be serving under my
direct command, is that clear?

24:16.444 --> 24:18.580
It is...

24:18.614 --> 24:20.749
sir.

24:33.132 --> 24:35.335
Miss Shippen.

24:35.370 --> 24:37.139
I am so pleased that you could come.

24:37.173 --> 24:39.840
I was happy to, if only to thank you again

24:39.874 --> 24:41.607
for your intervention with that mob.

24:41.641 --> 24:44.242
Of course. Did you see the house?

24:44.277 --> 24:46.344
I did.

24:46.378 --> 24:48.611
It's Ben Franklin's place.

24:48.645 --> 24:51.480
I'm told the officer recently quartered here

24:51.514 --> 24:54.584
absconded with many of his
paintings and inventions.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.119
Clearly a man of little honor.

24:56.153 --> 24:58.523
Unless he was trying to protect them.

24:58.557 --> 25:01.559
- General...
- Benedict, please.

25:01.593 --> 25:03.993
And I hope that I may call you Margaret

25:04.028 --> 25:05.525
as I did when we corresponded.

25:05.560 --> 25:08.760
Of course. Though my friends call me Peggy.

25:08.794 --> 25:11.497
Then we are to be friends?

25:11.531 --> 25:13.032
I hope so.

25:14.400 --> 25:18.404
I confess that is not all I hope for.

25:18.438 --> 25:20.338
No?

25:22.042 --> 25:25.112
I have long carried a memory of you

25:25.146 --> 25:29.182
as a budding, lively young girl.

25:29.216 --> 25:33.750
But the woman I saw in the carriage...

25:34.884 --> 25:40.122
the woman who now stands before me,

25:40.156 --> 25:41.690
you have bloomed,

25:41.724 --> 25:44.525
become a vision.

25:44.559 --> 25:48.663
Forgive me. I am no poet.

25:48.697 --> 25:50.232
Merely a warrior.

25:50.267 --> 25:53.236
A warrior whose wounds
have made him question a life

25:53.271 --> 25:55.103
devoted solely to the quest for glory.

25:55.137 --> 25:59.841
But your letters have
shown me a different path.

25:59.875 --> 26:03.145
And now the sight of you only affirms it.

26:03.179 --> 26:05.652
You say you're not a poet, sir,

26:05.686 --> 26:08.020
but that was poetry if ever I heard it.

26:09.288 --> 26:13.261
The sentiments that you
conveyed in your letters,

26:13.295 --> 26:17.101
were they merely a courtesy?

26:17.136 --> 26:20.173
Or do they express your true feelings?

26:20.208 --> 26:23.975
Why... well, yes, I...

26:27.645 --> 26:29.411
Let's be married straightaway.

26:29.445 --> 26:31.012
Married?

26:31.046 --> 26:33.616
This house will suit us for now, but
I will soon build us one of our own.

26:33.650 --> 26:36.919
- A mansion even grander than Washington's.
- Sir, that's...

26:36.954 --> 26:39.089
Did you know that my previous
wife was named Margaret as well?

26:39.123 --> 26:42.091
To lose one Margaret only to gain another.

26:42.126 --> 26:45.526
- Now if that does not show that providence has...
- General!

26:45.560 --> 26:49.096
I cannot be married to you.

26:50.098 --> 26:52.966
But why not? I thought you...

26:53.001 --> 26:55.867
Yes, yes, I have feelings for you.

26:55.901 --> 26:59.272
Feelings that could grow.

26:59.306 --> 27:01.541
But this is Philadelphia.

27:01.575 --> 27:03.641
There are conventions.

27:03.676 --> 27:07.345
First and foremost, obtaining
my father's approval.

27:08.779 --> 27:11.178
Yes, you're right. Of course.

27:11.213 --> 27:13.048
And I'm afraid he may draw conclusions

27:13.083 --> 27:15.486
that don't help your cause
if I'm away too long.

27:15.522 --> 27:18.290
He sounds like a formidable man.

27:18.325 --> 27:21.259
Many would agree with you.

27:21.293 --> 27:24.466
I doubt he is more formidable

27:24.501 --> 27:27.402
than General Johnny Burgoyne.

27:29.339 --> 27:33.109
When I surrounded him at Saratoga,

27:33.143 --> 27:35.610
he had no choice

27:35.645 --> 27:39.249
but to yield to my demands.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.655
( Soft laugh )

27:50.928 --> 27:54.163
<i>( birds calling )</i>

28:09.277 --> 28:11.878
Finally. I thought he'd never fall asleep.

28:11.912 --> 28:15.013
It's too much excitement for one day.

28:15.047 --> 28:16.614
He'll sleep soundly now, though.

28:16.649 --> 28:19.017
He's had his fill.

28:19.051 --> 28:22.487
He'll sleep soundly
because his father's home.

28:24.023 --> 28:27.058
I did a lot of thinking in prison.

28:27.092 --> 28:29.994
About my future.

28:31.630 --> 28:33.798
Our future.

28:37.236 --> 28:41.107
I think it's time I rebuild our farm.

28:41.142 --> 28:44.514
I just want things to go
back to the way they were.

28:46.551 --> 28:48.687
The way things were?

28:50.558 --> 28:54.629
When you kept a codebook and a
pistol beneath the floorboards?

29:01.006 --> 29:03.843
I learned my lesson in New York.

29:05.412 --> 29:08.881
From now on, I'm staying here.

29:08.916 --> 29:10.550
I'm staying right here.

29:10.584 --> 29:13.720
There's no reason for me
to go back into the city.

29:13.754 --> 29:16.323
My work for Washington is behind me now.

29:16.357 --> 29:18.461
Don't lie.

29:19.462 --> 29:21.928
It only makes you ill.

29:56.167 --> 30:00.006
When this is over, I have
a special job for you.

30:00.041 --> 30:02.540
I want you to track Abraham Woodhull.

30:02.574 --> 30:04.640
- Track him?
- Follow him.

30:04.675 --> 30:07.575
At a distance so he's never
aware of your presence.

30:07.609 --> 30:12.210
<i>I want to know where he goes day and night.</i>

30:14.447 --> 30:17.616
He's just a farmer. Shouldn't be a problem.

30:18.785 --> 30:20.119
No, sir.

30:20.153 --> 30:22.021
I can track him just fine.

30:24.223 --> 30:28.128
It's just I was hoping maybe you
could give me a few days' leave.

30:28.162 --> 30:29.928
Leave?

30:31.231 --> 30:34.168
Miss Anna, she asked me
to take that tavern boy

30:34.202 --> 30:36.302
Cicero to New York to be with his mama.

30:36.336 --> 30:37.570
I see.

30:37.605 --> 30:39.942
Maclnnis or Tanner,

30:39.976 --> 30:41.511
they could follow the farmer.

30:41.546 --> 30:43.714
They're both good trackers.

30:43.748 --> 30:45.682
Quite keen on going, aren't you,

30:45.717 --> 30:47.917
to make a request like this with me.

30:47.952 --> 30:49.652
Is it purely for the boy's sake?

30:49.687 --> 30:51.120
Yes, sir.

30:52.957 --> 30:57.094
I can always tell when a man
is lying to me, Akinbode.

30:59.464 --> 31:02.033
Tell me the true reason.

31:04.805 --> 31:07.340
Abigail, isn't it?

31:09.311 --> 31:12.846
I saw her recently in Philadelphia.

31:15.516 --> 31:17.286
Are you in love with her?

31:17.320 --> 31:18.723
In love?

31:18.757 --> 31:22.058
Remember, I can spot a lie.

31:24.396 --> 31:27.094
I... I guess I love her.

31:30.733 --> 31:32.766
"I hate...

31:36.536 --> 31:38.768
and I love.

31:39.803 --> 31:42.608
Why I do so, perhaps you ask.

31:43.945 --> 31:47.612
I know not, but I feel it.

31:48.616 --> 31:52.121
And I am in torment."

31:52.155 --> 31:55.022
A bit of ancient wisdom for
you to mull on your journey.

32:01.263 --> 32:03.266
Ah, here we go.

32:12.479 --> 32:15.217
You're late.

32:15.251 --> 32:17.218
Shall we do this or not?

32:31.837 --> 32:34.705
I'm curious why you requested this parley.

32:34.739 --> 32:36.639
I would think it would be obvious.

32:36.673 --> 32:38.975
Typically each side must
prove that the other

32:39.009 --> 32:41.943
has something to lose by
continuing the conflict.

32:41.978 --> 32:44.776
Allowing two British parties

32:44.810 --> 32:47.813
to bloody each other further
wouldn't be good for either of us.

32:47.847 --> 32:50.913
I'm sorry, have you seen any blood?

32:50.947 --> 32:52.949
Nor will you.

32:52.983 --> 32:55.652
Even as I whittle down your force man by man

32:55.686 --> 32:57.788
until you agree to my terms.

32:57.822 --> 32:59.156
What terms?

32:59.190 --> 33:01.627
I want you to resign your
commission and leave Setauket.

33:01.661 --> 33:02.696
( laughs )

33:02.731 --> 33:05.532
I am sorry about your horse.

33:05.566 --> 33:08.067
It's a shame a dumb animal had to die

33:08.101 --> 33:10.570
so I could have revenge
on my former captors.

33:14.341 --> 33:16.108
You killed Bucephalus?

33:16.143 --> 33:17.810
Mmm.

33:17.845 --> 33:20.649
And pinned the blame on
Caleb Brewster's uncle.

33:20.683 --> 33:23.120
As I did with Benjamin Tallmadge's father

33:23.154 --> 33:24.620
for the shooting of the magistrate.

33:24.654 --> 33:28.526
You, in your pompous need
to play the stern father

33:28.561 --> 33:32.131
to the Crown's wayward
children, swallowed all of it.

33:32.165 --> 33:35.967
Like a French whore swallows a man

33:36.001 --> 33:39.138
right down to his root.

33:41.738 --> 33:46.642
I don't have to sink to your
level to beat you, John.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.075
I just have to wait.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.542
For someone to ride to the rescue?

33:49.576 --> 33:51.210
<i>For you to destroy yourself,</i>

33:51.244 --> 33:53.814
just like you did in the rebel siege.

33:53.848 --> 33:55.715
Despite your pretense of control,

33:55.749 --> 33:59.017
<i>you can only contain your
inner beast for so long.</i>

33:59.052 --> 34:00.852
<i>And the next time it lashes out,</i>

34:00.886 --> 34:04.121
I will be ready with all the excuse I need

34:04.156 --> 34:07.394
to put you down like the
mad dog that you are.

34:07.429 --> 34:09.829
That same beast you decry

34:09.864 --> 34:12.466
is what will always give me the edge.

34:15.235 --> 34:19.069
For I'm willing to do what you are not.

34:41.946 --> 34:47.482
- <i> ( Wind howling )</i>
- <i> ( Creatures calling )</i>

34:49.561 --> 34:52.737
<i>( metal squeaking )</i>

34:59.201 --> 35:01.255
( door creaks )

35:36.113 --> 35:37.880
Be careful, you'll rip it.

35:37.914 --> 35:39.783
Rip what?

35:39.817 --> 35:41.420
This.

35:42.055 --> 35:43.189
- A bill?
- No.

35:43.223 --> 35:46.122
Intelligence from Robert Townsend.

35:46.155 --> 35:48.055
I just need the reagent to see what it says.

35:48.090 --> 35:50.794
You gave him the invisible ink
before you were imprisoned?

35:50.828 --> 35:52.897
- No, Caleb gave it to him.
- Caleb?

35:52.931 --> 35:56.268
Yeah, he smuggled himself into New
York disguised as a British colonel

35:56.302 --> 35:57.869
to rescue me, only I
didn't want to be rescued.

35:57.903 --> 36:00.171
I wanted Robert Townsend
and now we have him.

36:00.205 --> 36:01.938
I spent the last month trying to contact

36:01.972 --> 36:03.505
Ben and Caleb and hearing nothing.

36:03.539 --> 36:04.840
I thought they had abandoned us.

36:04.874 --> 36:06.343
The British are pushing back
all the way to New York.

36:06.378 --> 36:07.577
They'll need us now more than ever.

36:07.611 --> 36:09.611
I thought this Townsend already refused you.

36:09.645 --> 36:11.346
He changed his mind

36:11.381 --> 36:13.815
after Simcoe and his Rangers
torched his father's stables.

36:13.849 --> 36:16.715
That man is so keen on hunting rebels,

36:16.749 --> 36:19.250
<i>but all he does is create new ones.</i>

36:19.284 --> 36:22.986
Well, he may live to regret this one.

36:23.020 --> 36:25.525
Let's see what Culper Jr. Has to say.

36:27.059 --> 36:29.825
Robert's voice:
<i>"To my erstwhile draughts opponent,</i>

36:29.859 --> 36:31.628
<i>I hesitate to write your name</i>

36:31.662 --> 36:35.737
<i>even with the sympathetic stain
your man Brewster has provided,</i>

36:35.772 --> 36:39.705
<i>as I am new to the
secrecy this work requires</i>

36:39.740 --> 36:41.742
<i>and am already finding myself unwilling</i>

36:41.777 --> 36:45.914
<i>to put my full trust in anyone or anything.</i>

36:54.662 --> 36:56.928
<i>I have realized with harsh clarity</i>

36:56.962 --> 37:00.999
<i>that one cannot turn from the
injustice of this occupation,</i>

37:01.034 --> 37:03.202
<i>for it will come home.</i>

37:12.516 --> 37:16.482
<i>So I have made certain changes
to my business interests.</i>

37:21.720 --> 37:24.421
<i>I've sold my boardinghouse
and used the proceeds</i>

37:24.456 --> 37:26.857
<i>to buy into an establishment more popular</i>

37:26.892 --> 37:31.665
<i>with the senior players in both
the military and the government."</i>

37:36.872 --> 37:39.976
<i>( men laughing )</i>

37:40.010 --> 37:41.880
Robert's voice: <i>"Call it beginner's luck</i>

37:41.914 --> 37:45.289
<i>or a higher authority lending his blessing,</i>

37:45.323 --> 37:48.258
<i>but I have learned of something
that you must know right away,</i>

37:48.293 --> 37:52.461
<i>for I fear for our cause
should it come to pass."</i>

37:52.495 --> 37:56.834
It concerns a plot against
Washington himself.

37:56.868 --> 38:00.507
We have to get this to Caleb right away.

38:00.541 --> 38:02.010
Didn't you hear me before?

38:02.044 --> 38:04.210
I set a signal out every night
and have yet to hear from him.

38:04.245 --> 38:06.515
I left another signal at
Huntington on my way back.

38:06.549 --> 38:08.285
It was something we figured out in New York

38:08.319 --> 38:10.821
so he'd know if and when I was freed.

38:10.855 --> 38:13.720
Caleb's probably already
waiting at the drop.

38:13.755 --> 38:16.258
We have to get this to him
before the sun comes up.

38:17.460 --> 38:20.030
<i>( Door creaks )</i>

38:28.310 --> 38:30.977
Who's Caleb?

38:34.985 --> 38:37.755
Seems Captain Simcoe was right.

38:37.789 --> 38:39.324
You were up to something.

38:39.359 --> 38:40.827
No.

38:40.862 --> 38:42.899
What's that in your hand?

38:46.339 --> 38:48.373
Give it!

38:51.310 --> 38:53.077
Look at this.

39:02.550 --> 39:04.384
They're spies.

39:04.418 --> 39:07.820
Here we are, Tanner,
hunting all over Long Island,

39:07.854 --> 39:10.321
hunting for traitors,

39:10.355 --> 39:14.189
and all along they've been
right under our noses.

39:14.224 --> 39:17.192
- Now, where's this Caleb?
- There isn't any more...

39:17.227 --> 39:19.295
- ( Anna gasps ) No.
- ( Abraham groans )

39:19.329 --> 39:21.429
( breathing heavily )

39:21.463 --> 39:23.262
( groans )

39:23.297 --> 39:24.564
- Stop it!
- Why?

39:24.598 --> 39:26.032
( Whimpers ) No...

39:26.067 --> 39:27.335
You want to tell us something, hmm?

39:27.370 --> 39:28.872
Easy. Easy.

39:28.906 --> 39:31.541
If you're sweet on her,
I suggest you start talking

39:31.575 --> 39:34.979
while she still has that pretty face.

39:35.013 --> 39:37.082
Caleb is our contact in
the Continental Army.

39:37.116 --> 39:39.750
- Abe, no.
- Shut up!

39:40.652 --> 39:42.388
Where do you meet him?

39:43.725 --> 39:45.894
<i>Show us.</i>

39:45.928 --> 39:49.131
<i>( birds calling )</i>

39:56.107 --> 39:57.640
Isn't that sweet?

39:57.674 --> 39:59.674
( Whispers ) Take it.

40:25.935 --> 40:27.536
<i>( Branch snaps )</i>

40:27.570 --> 40:29.472
( grunts )

40:44.912 --> 40:47.884
And all the rats come out of the barrel.

40:51.254 --> 40:54.192
All in all, a good night's work, huh?

40:54.227 --> 40:56.996
Maybe the captain will reward us for this.

40:57.030 --> 40:59.531
Maybe promote us over that stinkin' African.

41:03.140 --> 41:04.942
Tanner: <i>Hog-tied.</i>

41:04.976 --> 41:07.046
Don't look like a bad idea.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.715
( Groans )

41:10.717 --> 41:13.086
Let Tanner have a go, huh?

41:14.089 --> 41:16.025
No, don't hurt him!

41:16.059 --> 41:19.061
You want we should go gentle?

41:19.096 --> 41:21.565
Then do likewise.

41:24.332 --> 41:27.500
Now... give us a kiss.

41:38.174 --> 41:40.107
Take him out.

41:52.053 --> 41:53.954
That's it.

41:53.988 --> 41:56.090
That's it.

41:58.126 --> 42:00.094
That's it.

42:01.932 --> 42:05.738
- ( Shrieks )
- ( Screams )

42:11.511 --> 42:13.478
( Anna screaming )

42:18.217 --> 42:20.050
( screams )

42:25.255 --> 42:26.922
Abe!

42:29.492 --> 42:30.459
Abe!

42:30.493 --> 42:33.835
- <i> Abe!</i>
- I'm trying!

42:33.869 --> 42:35.971
Abe, now!

42:36.006 --> 42:38.508
( Shouts )

42:38.542 --> 42:41.512
( gasping )

42:41.547 --> 42:44.482
( Anna shrieks )

42:51.557 --> 42:53.156
( gun clicks )

42:53.991 --> 42:56.424
( gunshot echoes )

43:03.961 --> 43:05.628
Hurry.

43:05.662 --> 43:07.698
- Come here. Come here.
- ( Groaning )

43:12.839 --> 43:15.707
Right, you two,

43:15.742 --> 43:18.011
in the boat now.

43:19.114 --> 43:22.252
Caleb, what happened to your beard?

43:22.286 --> 43:23.817
It was tickling the ladies, Annie.

43:23.852 --> 43:26.516
- Let's get out of here.
- No.

43:26.550 --> 43:29.222
You're taking two passengers, but not us.

43:29.256 --> 43:31.158
You'll row them out, you
drop them in the sound.

43:31.193 --> 43:33.826
Abe, you can't just...

43:33.860 --> 43:37.032
Simcoe sent them specifically to track you.

43:37.066 --> 43:38.668
If they go missing, you'll
be the first suspect.

43:38.702 --> 43:41.936
Unless... unless it looks like
someone got to them first.

43:41.971 --> 43:45.240
Now it's obvious that the Rangers and
the redcoats are at each other's throats.

43:45.274 --> 43:48.545
You'll just set up a whole
war right here in Setauket.

43:48.579 --> 43:50.946
- <i> There'll be more blood.</i>
- Well, at least it's not ours.

43:50.980 --> 43:52.951
What are you talking about?

43:56.123 --> 43:57.391
All right, this'll do.

43:57.425 --> 43:59.762
All right.

43:59.797 --> 44:01.197
I can help you plant that.

44:01.231 --> 44:04.166
No, you need to take this to
Ben and Washington now.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.271
It's from Townsend. It may mean the war.

44:07.305 --> 44:09.442
What? Really?

44:09.477 --> 44:11.477
Read it on the way.

44:11.511 --> 44:13.145
Let's get this cargo in the boat.

44:13.180 --> 44:15.547
Help me with this guy.

44:16.415 --> 44:17.682
Jesus.

44:21.153 --> 44:23.750
<i>( Abraham grunting )</i>

44:23.784 --> 44:25.821
All right, all right.

44:25.855 --> 44:28.689
- Put him down.
- Jesus.

44:28.724 --> 44:30.325
All right, let's get these in there.

44:30.359 --> 44:33.364
