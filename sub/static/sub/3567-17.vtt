Whoa! I can see why this
is your favorite film franchise!

01:13.682 --> 01:17.985
That's right. In a world where humanity
is pushed to the brink, it turns out

01:18.086 --> 01:23.190
- that the one who is most human is a dog... copter.
- And did you see where

01:23.258 --> 01:25.393
- that missile came out of?!
- Yeah.

01:25.460 --> 01:29.622
I just hope it stays
faithful to the book.

01:30.309 --> 01:33.530
- Ah...
- The Gems are back.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.434
Greetings.

01:36.469 --> 01:42.176
Oh! W-well, hello, Connie!
What a surprise to see you!

01:42.244 --> 01:45.546
We're gonna watch a movie about
a wacky flying dog! Show them, Connie!

01:45.614 --> 01:50.651
I mean, it's about much
more than that.

01:50.719 --> 01:54.021
- Oh, that's easy.
- Wha...?

01:54.022 --> 01:59.093
Who needs to go see movies
when you've got magic?!

02:01.997 --> 02:04.498
- Ugh.
- Aw, stop showing off, Amethyst.

02:04.566 --> 02:08.118
Connie promises this movie's
even better than any magic!

02:08.119 --> 02:11.005
- I did not say that.
- And check this out!

02:11.006 --> 02:14.275
- We got our own snacks!
- My parents say I'm not allowed

02:14.376 --> 02:18.757
to buy snacks at the theater.
So we're not buying anything at the theater.

02:18.792 --> 02:23.377
- Nom noms! Feed me!
- Hands off, Amethyst!

02:23.412 --> 02:25.586
These are for Connie and
me to share at the movie.

02:25.687 --> 02:31.225
Speaking of which, how are we getting
to the theater? It's kind of far.

02:31.326 --> 02:33.522
Don't worry.
I've got it covered.

02:33.523 --> 02:35.718
Today we're gonna travel in style.

02:36.753 --> 02:42.927
Introducing the finest
in luxury transportation... Lion!

02:46.439 --> 02:48.644
Aw, you little goofball.

02:48.679 --> 02:52.947
- You have a pet lion?!
- Lion is sort of like a pet.

02:52.982 --> 02:54.949
He does his own thing
most of the time, though.

02:59.688 --> 03:03.190
- See? Who knows where he got that?
- Wow, Steven.

03:03.258 --> 03:08.181
Everything in your life is so
awesome and magical. The most

03:08.259 --> 03:12.487
exciting thing in my
life is tennis practice.

03:12.488 --> 03:14.602
Forehand! Backhand!

03:14.669 --> 03:19.095
- Overhead death strike!
- Whoa! Tennis is rad!

03:19.096 --> 03:23.214
Well, I made up that last one.

03:24.848 --> 03:28.450
I think Lion says we
should hurry up and go.

03:28.451 --> 03:31.322
Or maybe he was just yawning.

03:31.955 --> 03:34.255
Anyway, let's go to the movie!

03:34.322 --> 03:39.487
And we're off! Uhh...

03:40.128 --> 03:42.563
Lion, I want you to
take us to the movie.

03:42.564 --> 03:44.999
Okay, you're not listening to me.

03:45.066 --> 03:49.236
Lion isn't trained very well.

03:49.337 --> 03:52.139
But I'm not trained very well
either, so we're a ...

03:52.207 --> 03:54.442
<i> Whoa!</i>

03:54.443 --> 03:58.913
<i>Whoa!</i>

03:59.014 --> 04:04.186
Wait, Lion!
Don't go in the ocean!

04:05.253 --> 04:06.832
You can walk on water?

04:06.833 --> 04:09.990
Why don't you tell me you
can do these things you do?!

Heyo!

04:23.735 --> 04:29.001
- Uh... are you sure he knows where he's going?
- Maybe it's a short cut.

04:42.652 --> 04:46.508
- Has he ever done this?
- No, this is new!

04:52.490 --> 04:55.569
<i>Whoa!</i>

04:55.637 --> 05:00.140
- Are you okay?
- That was really cool.

05:00.242 --> 05:03.210
Lion! Wait!
Where are you going?!

05:03.278 --> 05:06.881
Oof! Whoa!
Is this one of those...

05:06.982 --> 05:12.336
magic gem places that
you've told me about?

05:13.950 --> 05:16.139
Yep. Magic gem place.

05:17.066 --> 05:20.127
Lion, normally I'm all about this stuff,

05:20.195 --> 05:22.314
but this is not the movies.

05:22.349 --> 05:24.652
What does that mean, Lion?
What does that even mean?

05:24.653 --> 05:28.507
What if he brought
you here for a reason?

05:28.542 --> 05:32.758
Well, maybe, but if we don't
hurry, we're gonna miss the commercials,

05:32.793 --> 05:35.576
and then we might miss the previews,
and we still have to find the perfect

05:35.644 --> 05:39.346
seats near the front but
not too close.

05:39.447 --> 05:43.284
- Hey. I think it likes you!
- Ah!

05:43.351 --> 05:48.389
- My hand's stuck! It won't... come off!
- Hang on!

05:50.976 --> 05:53.494
Man, that's really stuck on good.

05:53.562 --> 05:58.499
- I guess we'll have to chop it off.
- What?!

06:00.335 --> 06:03.387
- Hey, swords!
- No!

06:03.788 --> 06:08.009
- Whoa! How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

06:08.010 --> 06:11.011
- Do it again! Do it again!
- Um, okay.

06:13.982 --> 06:17.718
- Anything?
- No. Here.

06:17.753 --> 06:19.553
Ow!
What are you ...  hey!

06:19.621 --> 06:24.558
- What are you doing?
- Maybe if I do... this!

06:24.659 --> 06:28.562
Wait, I'm ticklish.

06:28.597 --> 06:32.657
Wait. Stop. Stop.
I'm gonna pee!

06:34.208 --> 06:37.004
Whoa. Look at all this armor!

06:37.072 --> 06:41.379
- Press my nose. Press my nose!
- Boop!

06:41.643 --> 06:44.478
- Are those light cannons?
- Next!

06:44.546 --> 06:48.482
<i> Axes!
Spiky chain balls! A giant...</i>

06:48.550 --> 06:50.818
- Penny?
- Does that mean

06:50.819 --> 06:53.087
its worth more than a regular penny?

06:53.154 --> 06:58.626
Well, that would make "cents."

06:58.693 --> 07:01.274
This is so great, but...

07:01.383 --> 07:04.431
I get the feeling, though, I'm
not really supposed to be here.

07:04.499 --> 07:06.178
I want you here!

07:06.179 --> 07:09.536
I mean, I don't want you here.
I guess Lion wants us here.

07:09.604 --> 07:14.062
But I want us to be at the movies!
And I want to see lots of explosions.

07:24.074 --> 07:27.554
- Should we be worried about this?
- Uh...

07:27.622 --> 07:32.302
<i>Lion doesn't seem to be worried.</i>

07:34.066 --> 07:36.630
Run!

07:41.136 --> 07:45.011
- Connie!
- Steven! Look out!

07:46.069 --> 07:48.154
Ah! Huh?

07:48.189 --> 07:52.100
Steven! What do we do?!

07:52.709 --> 07:54.077
Ah!

07:54.112 --> 07:58.986
Connie! Ah!

08:06.561 --> 08:10.064
My bubble.

08:10.165 --> 08:14.068
Lion! Get us out of here!
Lion, please!

08:31.403 --> 08:34.554
What?
Now you take us to the movies?

08:34.621 --> 08:39.056
- Whoa!
- Ah.

08:39.091 --> 08:41.813
Connie, here.
I have something for that.

08:41.828 --> 08:45.240
- Sorry. They're not that cold.
- Thanks.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.701
Well, we're here.
Shall we go in?

08:47.702 --> 08:51.205
That's okay.
L-let's just forget about it.

08:51.272 --> 08:56.093
Huh? I-I'm sorry!
Ugh! I ruined everything, didn't I?

08:56.094 --> 08:57.978
I don't know why you hang out with me.

08:58.046 --> 09:02.477
- I mess stuff up all the time.
- I don't know why you hang out with me!

09:02.512 --> 09:05.197
I'm so much more... less
interesting than you!

09:05.198 --> 09:09.398
And obviously you have some
sort of magical destiny.

09:09.433 --> 09:12.669
Why would you even care about
something like Dogcopter?

09:12.704 --> 09:15.334
Why?! Because it's Dogcopter!

09:15.335 --> 09:19.253
He's a dog and a helicopter and a cop!

09:19.288 --> 09:22.536
He shoots missiles out his butt,
and he's gonna save the world!

09:22.604 --> 09:27.174
Dogcopter is very cool
and important... to me.

09:27.275 --> 09:31.482
Well, I'm no Dogcopter.

09:31.517 --> 09:33.772
What the ...

09:33.807 --> 09:38.523
- Oh, no!
- It's the robot shooty thing!

09:38.666 --> 09:42.176
How are we supposed to beat it?
Lion, what do we do?

09:52.267 --> 09:55.219
Uh... this is weird, right?

09:55.220 --> 09:59.018
You have a sword in your head?!

09:59.053 --> 10:02.441
Why don't you tell me you
can do these things you do?!

10:03.556 --> 10:05.890
It came through!

10:10.101 --> 10:11.589
<i>Whoa!</i>

10:13.655 --> 10:17.157
- What do I do with this?!
- Watch out!

10:21.229 --> 10:23.764
Forehand! Backhand!

10:23.765 --> 10:29.435
<i>Overhead...
death strike!</i>

10:36.676 --> 10:42.136
- Just like tennis practice.
- Magical destiny practice.

10:44.454 --> 10:49.065
- Hi!
- Uh, hello.

10:49.100 --> 10:53.527
Two kids and one Lion
to see "Dogcopter."

10:53.595 --> 10:57.015
Um, do you have a rewards card?

11:02.303 --> 11:05.887
Whoa!
Was that in the book?

11:05.922 --> 11:08.863
Eh, they're taking some liberties.
