the best in the industry.

16:23.006 --> 16:24.465

16:28.428 --> 16:30.595
a job in the last two years?

way, so I can't help you.

here for a minute?

16:52.077 --> 16:54.995
All right, I'm listening.

16:54.997 --> 16:58.916
Now you know the kidnapper,
it's Javier Moralas.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.250
Now you might understand why

17:00.252 --> 17:03.003
I flew all the way out
here just to meet you.

17:03.005 --> 17:07.425
Javier Moralas, I thought
he was sitting behind bars?

17:07.426 --> 17:08.717
Not anymore.

17:08.719 --> 17:11.262
His rebels freed him
several weeks ago,

17:11.263 --> 17:12.679
and right afterwards
they kidnapped

17:12.681 --> 17:15.433
my bosses wife and left
the place a massacre.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.269
Morales?

17:17.436 --> 17:19.060
Doesn't strike me
as a kidnapper.

17:19.063 --> 17:20.730
Anyway, that's what he did.

17:20.732 --> 17:24.192
Mr. Guerra, how about the
following proposition.

17:24.194 --> 17:26.613
You fly out to meet my
boss and talk to him.

17:30.824 --> 17:34.703
In this envelop is $2,500.

17:36.538 --> 17:37.372
For you.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.000
If you come out to meet my boss,

17:41.002 --> 17:44.920
there will be another 2,500
just to listen to him.

17:44.922 --> 17:48.256
If you don't like what
you hear you walk away

17:48.258 --> 17:50.719
and you can keep the whole
5,000, how's that huh?

17:52.471 --> 17:55.724

out and listen to your boss?

17:58.227 --> 17:59.062

contact you with the details.

for Ortega for many years before
he went back to the states.

19:19.934 --> 19:23.146
It was him who tracked down
Javier Moralas five years ago.

19:24.313 --> 19:26.397
In the last two
years he's rumored

19:26.399 --> 19:28.443
to have freed more
than 100 hostages.

19:56.470 --> 19:58.515
for seven hours,
it was just fine.

19:59.681 --> 20:01.307
Sorry to hear that.

20:01.309 --> 20:03.019
Don't worry, I'm
used to it here.

get down to business.

20:16.698 --> 20:17.950
Well, of course.

20:41.015 --> 20:42.350

20:44.393 --> 20:45.227

20:46.603 --> 20:47.521

enough, I would say.

21:04.746 --> 21:08.374
And what, what is
your opinion of him?

21:08.376 --> 21:10.333
Let's put it this way,

21:10.335 --> 21:13.881
I have the upmost respect
for him as a soldier.

21:15.425 --> 21:16.426
I understand.

21:17.593 --> 21:20.427
This soldier you
respect so much,

21:20.429 --> 21:25.267
this soldier has kidnapped
my wife 17 days ago.

21:26.686 --> 21:31.107
So far, we haven't heard
from him and nor from her.

21:34.151 --> 21:37.447
Mr. Guerra, you
are my last hope.

21:39.740 --> 21:44.119

bring back my wife.

21:48.041 --> 21:51.127

Mr. Levin, I'm going to
explain very pragmatically

22:05.140 --> 22:07.934
how I see the situation
and what I can do for you.

22:07.936 --> 22:10.144
You see in this country
there are countless criminals

22:10.146 --> 22:12.980
and political groups
that live off kidnapping.

22:12.982 --> 22:14.857
Some of them do it to get rich,

22:14.859 --> 22:17.318
others to fund the
rebel movement.

22:17.320 --> 22:18.569
- Let's see him.
- But no matter which group

22:18.571 --> 22:20.530
we talk about it is always about

22:20.532 --> 22:23.532
the money, and nothing else.

22:23.534 --> 22:24.826
Rarely are the

22:24.828 --> 22:26.369
motives different.
(MUFFLED TALKING)

22:26.371 --> 22:27.994
That's why I can only advise you

22:27.996 --> 22:30.374
to wait until the
kidnappers contact you.

22:32.209 --> 22:33.417
(MAN GROANING)

22:33.419 --> 22:37.170
Who can be sure
that these psychopaths

22:37.172 --> 22:39.048
are not gonna kill
her in the meantime?

22:39.050 --> 22:42.053
Nobody, but you don't
have another choice.

22:43.012 --> 22:44.347
Your plan is too risky.

22:46.515 --> 22:49.724
Your wife is being held
somewhere up in the mountains.

22:49.726 --> 22:52.853
Not even government forces
dare go near that area,

22:52.855 --> 22:56.357
and to find Javier up
there is almost impossible.

22:56.359 --> 22:59.195
He's very clever and he
constantly moves his camp.

23:00.071 --> 23:01.738
If he realizes we're after him,

23:03.032 --> 23:05.201
it would mean your
wife's immediate death.

23:08.580 --> 23:11.371
So, I'm supposed to wait?

23:11.373 --> 23:12.455
For how long?

23:12.457 --> 23:13.418
Difficult to say.

23:14.878 --> 23:17.211
It may be a week or even a
month before the kidnappers

23:17.213 --> 23:21.882
contact you, and then
suddenly out of no where,

23:21.884 --> 23:23.885
when you don't see it coming,

23:23.887 --> 23:25.638
they're gonna make
their demands.

23:26.930 --> 23:29.183
This approach is
designed to wear you out,

23:30.601 --> 23:33.438
and the longer this game goes
on, the higher the demands.

23:35.439 --> 23:37.941
And Javier is not gonna
go about it any other way.

23:39.067 --> 23:41.444
He has no interest
in killing your wife.

23:41.446 --> 23:43.448
He wants money, and lots of it.

23:45.574 --> 23:48.576
Mr. Levin, guess
how many men Javier

23:48.578 --> 23:50.535
has with experience of battle?

23:50.537 --> 23:51.745
100?

23:51.747 --> 23:53.540
200, or even more?

23:54.583 --> 23:55.582
What would you guess?

23:55.584 --> 23:57.544
That question is irrelevant.

24:00.047 --> 24:03.092
I'm sorry, Mr. Levin, I cannot
assist you in this matter.

24:06.763 --> 24:07.597
One million.

24:27.115 --> 24:31.286
Mr. Guerra, I know we're
going against all the odds,

24:32.913 --> 24:37.000
but if anyone can
accomplish this, it is you.

24:40.045 --> 24:45.051
As long as there is
a chance, one chance,

24:46.218 --> 24:48.303
I'll keep fighting
for my wife's life.

24:49.721 --> 24:53.433
That is to your credit, Mr.
Levin, but it is impossible.

24:56.896 --> 25:01.732
Let's say that I do the
job and hypothetically

25:01.734 --> 25:04.318
we're lucky enough
to find his hideout.

25:04.320 --> 25:07.780
How are we supposed to free
your wife and at the same time

25:07.782 --> 25:11.199
capture Javier Moralas and
make it the whole way through

25:11.201 --> 25:13.328

bring him back here?

25:14.330 --> 25:15.415
It is impossible.

a pattern here?

and I rarely do that.

offer is quite compelling.

They say there's bandits
around these parts, you know?

53:31.568 --> 53:33.653
Nasty little hombres.

53:33.655 --> 53:36.990
Who like to attack tourists
in order to rob them

53:37.825 --> 53:40.200
and rape their women.

53:40.202 --> 53:43.954
Especially Americans,
get attacked real often.

53:43.956 --> 53:45.957

for seven horses.

has got in her bag.

down and have a look.

Come on, Isabelle.

56:02.302 --> 56:03.136
Okay.

56:04.514 --> 56:06.430
I think the best time to
attack is during the night,

56:06.432 --> 56:07.974
when everyone's asleep.

56:07.976 --> 56:09.934
That way we have the
element of surprise.

No, that's impossible.

double the guards.

during the day?

That is suicide.

Ortega already made

56:28.204 --> 56:30.789
the mistake of attacking
the fort during the night.

56:32.876 --> 56:34.082
It was a mess.

56:34.084 --> 56:36.376
The government troops
took heavy losses.

56:36.378 --> 56:39.046

56:39.048 --> 56:41.676

There are hidden paths and
secret tunnels through here.

Several of the houses
are also connected

56:53.604 --> 56:55.398
You have no chance at night.

56:56.566 --> 56:58.234
So an attack can
only work this way.

56:59.443 --> 57:01.318
During the day
they're distracted.

57:01.320 --> 57:02.572
They'll be training here.

One group attacks the
trainees, that's not a problem.

in the mountains.

58:28.490 --> 58:29.823

58:31.410 --> 58:33.287
gonna have the
balls to attack him.

Not even government troops.

At that time Valentina usually
goes to Leonora's grave
