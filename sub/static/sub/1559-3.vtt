00:05.172 --> 00:06.338
Help!

00:06.340 --> 00:07.740
Somebody help me!

00:07.742 --> 00:09.141
( Roaring )

00:09.143 --> 00:10.776
Somebody help me!

00:10.778 --> 00:12.344
Help me!

00:12.346 --> 00:14.313
- Help me!

00:17.785 --> 00:20.252
Help me, please,
you have to help me!

00:20.254 --> 00:21.587
Please!

00:21.589 --> 00:22.721
( Speaking in ancient Greek )

00:22.723 --> 00:25.357
( Screaming )

00:40.174 --> 00:42.508
Hey, what's that place
with great turkey panini?

00:42.510 --> 00:46.745
Mancolo's.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.614
No, no the--

00:48.616 --> 00:50.315
Oh, um, Castellani's.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.117
Mm.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.653
Order lunch from there for
the department budget meeting.

00:55.478 --> 00:57.356
Love that panini.

Oomph.

02:00.187 --> 02:03.522
( Sighs )

02:03.524 --> 02:06.158
It took me two minutes to
disable all three of you.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.327
Stone, you've got an IQ of 190.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.795
You should know you can't solve
everything with brute force alone.

02:10.798 --> 02:11.798
It's worked so far.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.765
Fight smarter, not harder.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.267
Still, at least
you can fight.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.302
Ezekiel bailed on his team.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.304
These are the hands of
a world-class thief.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.405
I don't do punchy.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.641
And Cassandra hid. Badly.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.843
I'm here to do
science and math.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.411
And occasionally
hallucinate.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.779
You're just not being fair.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.618
You think I'm not fair,
wait until you meet

02:32.620 --> 02:35.420
the bad guys, which is why
we'll run drills again tomorrow

02:35.422 --> 02:38.423
and every day until I'm sure
I can take you out

02:38.425 --> 02:41.393
into the field with even a chance
of you coming back in one piece.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.900
How substandard
were they?

02:47.902 --> 02:49.768
Good pep talk, Jenkins.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.905
While you were out, a new page
appeared in the clipping book.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.406
Looks fascinating.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.807
No. Not yet.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.276
Well, this is crazy.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.510
Every day a new page shows up

02:58.512 --> 03:00.445
of weird newspaper
clippings in this book.

03:00.447 --> 03:02.447
And every day you
tell us to ignore it.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.283
We've hardly opened it
since the day Flynn left.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.851
Because you're not ready.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.953
Flynn told us we were
supposed to help people.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.922
Ezekiel's right.
Flynn gave us a job.

03:09.924 --> 03:12.357
We're supposed to be
checking out the weird--

03:12.359 --> 03:15.727
not sit around here.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.730
Ezekiel's right.
I said that.

03:21.769 --> 03:24.303
Jenkins, stay out--

03:29.443 --> 03:31.543
Marvelous, isn't it?

03:31.545 --> 03:34.413
I told you, this is
where I do my research.

03:34.415 --> 03:39.218
Judson always insisted we
just lock the artifacts away

03:39.220 --> 03:42.421
but I experiment
on them, study them.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.589
Improve them.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.591
( Electricity buzz )

03:44.592 --> 03:48.360
( Chuckles )

03:48.362 --> 03:50.262
It's hard enough to rein them
in without you dangling

03:50.264 --> 03:51.830
that clippings book
in front of them.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.632
Why rein them?

03:53.634 --> 03:56.435
You'll have to put them in
the field sooner or later.

03:56.437 --> 03:59.538
I've gone into the field
with experienced soldiers

03:59.540 --> 04:01.740
with a good plan, good Intel
and still come home

04:01.742 --> 04:03.542
with nothing but dog tags.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.311
I'm talking soldiers with
training who've seen combat.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.447
These three?

04:08.449 --> 04:10.449
I promised Flynn
I'd keep them alive.

04:10.451 --> 04:13.952
They're not even
close to ready.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.567
We're doing this, right?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.870
Hell yeah, we are.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.605
Let's go.

04:37.011 --> 04:39.645
I appreciate you wanting to
keep them out of harm's way.

04:39.647 --> 04:43.448
But librarians exist to keep
magic out of the wrong hands.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.584
Their job is to be
in harm's way.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.486
I can't protect three
of them at once

04:47.488 --> 04:48.553
and they can't take
care of themselves.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.622
Not without a lot
more training.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.557
We used to put librarians in the
field with no training at all.

04:52.559 --> 04:55.861
Oh, yeah?
And how many came back?

04:55.863 --> 04:58.964
The best ones.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.069
I said--

05:04.071 --> 05:06.505
Henry Birch.
Twenty-one.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.307
He was on a full-scholarship in chemical
engineering at Boston University.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.375
He went missing two days ago.

05:10.377 --> 05:13.478
Seven other clippings, all missing
people, disappeared this year.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.780
That many, the police
are on it.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.882
Nope. Victims are from all
around the country.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.650
The only reason to suspect
they're connected

05:18.652 --> 05:20.585
is that they all showed up
in our magic book.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.087
That's eight people gone.
Maybe dead.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.822
We don't have any--
you know?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.324
How many more are gonna go
missing before we step in?

05:25.326 --> 05:27.025
What if he's still alive?

05:27.027 --> 05:30.796
What if we have a chance to
save Henry Birch and we don't?

05:35.502 --> 05:37.836
And you're willing to risk
your lives for him?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.839
I won't risk my life.

05:40.841 --> 05:45.610
But I assume I can outrun
anything, so I'm in.

05:45.612 --> 05:49.781
( Inhales deeply, exhales )

05:49.783 --> 05:52.818
Fine, but we're
going in with a plan.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.619
I want full breakdowns on
the missing,

05:54.621 --> 05:56.054
backgrounds on
their workplaces,

05:56.056 --> 05:58.523
magical and
supernatural possibilities.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.559
Oh, God, what have I done?

06:02.730 --> 06:04.730
Even though the victims
were from all over,

06:04.732 --> 06:06.565
they all disappeared
in Boston.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.899
Any connection
beyond the city?

06:07.901 --> 06:10.902
Yes. Golden Axe Foods.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.738
They all worked and this
was tricky,

06:12.740 --> 06:13.839
some of them under subsidiaries,

06:13.841 --> 06:15.407
some under shell companies,

06:15.409 --> 06:19.010
Henry Birch was for a
scholarship, but...

06:21.048 --> 06:23.448
In conclusion, they were all
interns at Golden Axe Foods.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.716
I'm familiar with the logo.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.585
They were all over the farms
in my home town.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.054
They sell, like, engineered
seeds and stuff, it's huge.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.889
I've scoped the security.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.159
Run of the mill guards, boring
alarms, when do we break in?

06:34.161 --> 06:37.462
We don't break in, we go in,
we ask questions,

06:37.464 --> 06:39.431
no picking fights--

06:39.433 --> 06:41.700
What are you doing?

06:41.702 --> 06:43.068
Sending you to Boston.

06:44.505 --> 06:48.106
I present to you
the back door.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.674
Yeah, that's
the broom closet.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.543
Ah, no! It is a door

06:51.545 --> 06:55.914
behind which presently
exists the broom closet.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.783
Mr. Stone, hook those up.

06:57.785 --> 06:58.917
Put 'em here.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.752
You see, magic works
on similarities.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.588
Uh, symbolic resonance.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.890
Yes.

07:04.892 --> 07:08.126
A voodoo doll is
symbolic of a person.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.729
And lead can be
transformed into gold

07:10.731 --> 07:13.932
because it is
already similar.

07:17.638 --> 07:22.874
So, with a little magic

07:22.876 --> 07:26.912
and I might add a great deal

07:26.914 --> 07:29.114
of underappreciated work,

07:29.116 --> 07:30.582
that broom closet door

07:30.584 --> 07:33.485
can become a symbolic
representation

07:33.487 --> 07:36.521
of any other door.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.757
Oh!

08:14.127 --> 08:16.161
That first step might
be just a little--

08:16.163 --> 08:19.731
Yeah, thanks for
the warning, Jenkins.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.666
This is Boston.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.735
You moved the annex
to Boston?

08:23.737 --> 08:26.238
No, just the door.
Does no one listen?

08:26.240 --> 08:28.907
It's an Einstein-Rosen bridge.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.075
It's a wormhole.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.643
( Giggles )

08:31.645 --> 08:33.745
The back door is
on the East Coast--

08:38.852 --> 08:42.888
and the front door is
still on the West Coast.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.895
Wait, we can go anywhere
we want in the world?

08:49.897 --> 08:52.931
Absolutely anywhere,
that has a door.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.934
Still working out
the kinks.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.302
You know, it doesn't
stay open very long.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.304
And it's not the most
accurate thing.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.740
And most frankly, getting
to the right city is a win--

09:01.742 --> 09:03.675
Any door?

09:03.677 --> 09:06.211
Like, say,
a bank vault door?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.913
I'm asking for a mate.

09:07.915 --> 09:13.585
We do this, you do what
I say, when I say. Clear?

09:16.256 --> 09:17.256
Good luck.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.690
What?

09:18.692 --> 09:20.825
Nothing. Go away.
I'm working.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.067
Eight of our interns
have gone missing.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.807
Golden Axe Foods is one of the
oldest companies in the world.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.343
Over the decades,
the centuries,

09:38.345 --> 09:41.813
no matter war, famine,
plague, Golden Axe

09:41.815 --> 09:44.783
always prevails and we've
done so through integrity.

09:44.785 --> 09:49.754
So the idea of any
wrongdoing is--

09:49.756 --> 09:51.256
Well, I for one am shocked.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.658
Franklin, did you
know about this?

09:53.660 --> 09:55.260
I'm also shocked.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.363
And your interest
in this, miss?

09:58.365 --> 10:01.299
Colonel Baird, NATO
counter-terrorism.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.934
I am less shocked.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.235
( Chuckles )

10:04.237 --> 10:06.871
You think our interns
were terrorists?

10:06.873 --> 10:08.139
You're a big agribusiness.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.008
You have access
to the food supply.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.677
We prefer not
to take any chances.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.614
Miss Willis?

10:15.616 --> 10:17.315
The Tokyo office
is on the line.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.883
Not now, Jennie.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.054
( Door closes )

10:23.056 --> 10:25.323
Well, as CEO of Golden Axe,
I am, of course,

10:25.325 --> 10:28.159
deeply concerned about
this chain of events.

10:28.161 --> 10:31.296
But I don't know how
much more I can tell you.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.732
We throughput interns
pretty quickly here.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.034
Most don't have
the skills to compete.

10:36.036 --> 10:40.205
You can imagine what it's like
to deal with utter amateurs.

10:40.207 --> 10:44.342
You know, why don't you
speak to human resources?

10:44.344 --> 10:46.911
I'm sure they have the records of
the people you're looking for.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.383
Would you show them the way?

10:59.092 --> 11:01.572
Mr. Franklin, Tokyo really needs
to confirm the shipping price.

11:02.696 --> 11:03.928
Hai.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.296
They know something.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.132
How do you know
they know something?

11:07.134 --> 11:09.367
Eight missing interns, they
should've buried us in lawyers,

11:09.369 --> 11:12.771
not danced us straight in to
meet Karen Willis, the CEO.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.106
She wanted to size us up.
Find out what we know.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.875
So they know now that we know
something but do we now know

11:16.877 --> 11:19.110
they know something more than
just knowing we know something?

11:19.112 --> 11:21.212
I betcha whatever they're about to
show us in HR is gonna be faked up.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.947
You know, just for show.

11:22.949 --> 11:25.150
The originals might be
on the main server,

11:25.152 --> 11:27.052
if I can find the server room.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.154
We just passed it.
Back there.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.455
Yeah, air seals
for climate control.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.223
Most security I've seen
on this floor.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.793
Good, you three go to HR.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.327
If she wants to put on
a show, you're the audience.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.962
I'm gonna break into
the server room.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.165
Uh, Ezekiel Jones,
world-class thief.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.067
Why am I playing audience
and you're a burglar?

11:42.069 --> 11:45.070
Because I want the three
of you together, safe,

11:45.072 --> 11:47.238
in a place that
is very boring.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.274
What I say, when I say it.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.276
Excuse me? Restroom?

11:51.278 --> 11:53.144
Down the hall.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.946
Go ahead.
I'll catch up.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.016
( Speaks Japanese )

11:58.018 --> 11:59.117
Please.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.355
I'll wait for
your friend.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.390
Room zero-fourteen.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.959
Go left, left, then right.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.283
We should have warned Baird that
guy was going back after her.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.819
Hey, she's the one who
sent us on a snipe hunt.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.387
Let her sweat a little.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.923
What did he say?
Left, left and right?

13:11.792 --> 13:14.225
You are not servers.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.265
Look at this.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.069
Looks like Greek frescoes.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.305
This is late Helladic,
I think.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.307
Now why would these be
down here in the basement?

13:29.309 --> 13:31.276
More like, sub-basement.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.044
Did we down a little
and nobody noticed?

13:33.046 --> 13:35.046
Guys, can we just hurry up
and find Human Resources?

13:35.048 --> 13:37.081
This lighting is
giving me a headache.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.917
Are you sure it's not your
brain grape about to pop?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.251
Okay, new rule.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.853
How about we not refer
to the tumor that

13:41.855 --> 13:43.988
will one day kill me
as a brain grape?

13:43.990 --> 13:45.323
Ah, here we go.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.392
And I was worried
we were getting lost.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.967
We're not in
Human Resources.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.006
Go, go.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.118
Baird!

14:14.120 --> 14:15.286
I'm texting you
some pictures.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.888
I found something
real weird.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.857
Wow, did you?
We found something weird too!

14:18.859 --> 14:20.291
I found a room full
of really old art.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.593
That is weird.

14:21.595 --> 14:23.394
We found a room
full of human skulls!

14:23.396 --> 14:25.396
What do you mean
human skulls?

14:25.398 --> 14:27.966
How many ways can
I mean human skulls?

14:27.968 --> 14:29.300
Left, to left
and right, guys.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.969
This doesn't make
any sense.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.537
Wait a minute,
this is not late Helladic.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.372
This is Minoan.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.542
There's barely any complete
Minoan art known to exist.

14:37.544 --> 14:42.647
Minoan.
Why do I know that name?

14:42.649 --> 14:44.649
Greek mythology.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.318
Theseus and the Minotaur.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.955
Big monster,
head of a bull.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.524
Inescapable Labyrinth.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.159
Theseus had a big ball
of thread,

14:55.161 --> 14:57.161
used it so he
wouldn't get lost--

14:57.163 --> 15:01.266
This place is kind
of Labyrinth-y.

15:01.268 --> 15:05.270
And I'm looking at
a really old ball of thread.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.207
Well, that's
clearly stupid.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.376
There is no way
under a skyscraper

15:11.378 --> 15:12.944
we are in a Labyrinth.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.218
( Groans )

15:20.220 --> 15:21.920
Okay, maybe we are
in a Labyrinth.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.222
Let's go!

15:30.330 --> 15:31.462
( Phone rings )

15:31.464 --> 15:32.464
Yes.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.399
Jenkins, quick question.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.334
Any chance someone could
have recreated

15:36.336 --> 15:39.671
the Minotaur's Labyrinth in
a skyscraper in Boston?

15:39.673 --> 15:42.040
Goodness, no.
don't be absurd.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.408
Even assuming that you
had enough power,

15:43.410 --> 15:46.010
you would need a, just
a magnificent collection

15:46.012 --> 15:49.047
of ancient Minoan artifacts
to focus it.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.151
The librarians are
in the Labyrinth.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.519
I sent them there alone.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.553
Why?

15:55.555 --> 15:57.288
To keep them safe.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.691
That was a very bad idea.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.592
( Punching, grunting )

16:01.594 --> 16:03.428
Although I will
say I'm impressed.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.730
We've had guardians lose
librarians in the past of course.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.598
But never three in one day.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.600
It'll be quite some time
before anyone beats that.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.602
So how do we get them out?

16:11.604 --> 16:13.338
We don't.
It's a Labyrinth.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.106
The whole point
is you can't get out.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.507
Well, what about
your magic back door?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.309
Can't you open
that inside the Labyrinth?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.244
Colonel, I told you,
I was lucky we found Boston.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.313
I, I can't pinpoint them
in a maze.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.349
Okay, so what about that
other thing you said,

16:24.351 --> 16:27.986
symbolic whose-ee-flopper,
whatchamacallit, thingamajiggy?

16:27.988 --> 16:30.421
The Labyrinth isn't just a maze,
it's a magic maze. All right?

16:30.423 --> 16:34.058
It exists in more than
three dimensions

16:34.060 --> 16:35.259
and you know what
I seriously doubt?

16:35.261 --> 16:36.728
Putting an extra-dimensional
hole

16:36.730 --> 16:39.497
in a multi-dimensional
space is a very good idea!

16:39.499 --> 16:41.466
That was not a request.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.671
Guys, wait.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.072
Something isn't--

16:48.074 --> 16:50.742
Hm, just give me
a minute.

16:50.744 --> 16:53.111
Wasn't it right,
then right, then left?

16:53.113 --> 16:55.213
No, no, no, no, no.
This is not the time, kid.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.547
Okay? We got to run
because--

16:56.549 --> 16:59.484
Do not say because
the Minotaur is coming.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.753
Because there is no Minotaur
and I'll tell you why.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.355
In your myth,
what's-his-face?

17:04.357 --> 17:05.490
Theseus.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.425
Yeah, right.
He killed the Minotaur.

17:07.426 --> 17:10.194
So the Minotaur is dead,
and if it's dead,

17:10.195 --> 17:13.164
he's not here. Right?

17:13.165 --> 17:15.266
Right?

17:17.270 --> 17:20.038
( Creature roars )

17:55.675 --> 17:56.808
This is wrong.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.176
The hallway we were
in before should

17:58.178 --> 17:59.277
cut through here,
but it doesn't.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.611
It's impossible.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.280
Hey, guys, I think
we should go this way.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.415
This is great.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.451
Stuck in a magic maze with two of
the least reliable people I know.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.785
Wait, least reliable?

18:07.787 --> 18:09.687
You have been on
my case non-stop.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.255
Why am I "unreliable"?

18:11.257 --> 18:13.091
Not now, all right?
We got to move.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.860
I know. I betrayed you
that first time, so--

18:15.862 --> 18:18.429
Not now.

18:18.431 --> 18:23.835
Hey. I was scared.

18:23.837 --> 18:25.536
I have a death sentence
inside my head

18:25.538 --> 18:27.605
and they offered me a cure,
so what was I supposed to do?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.474
Not sell us out.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.542
So self-righteous.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.611
Look at me and all
I've sacrificed;

18:33.613 --> 18:35.179
I'm such a good boy.

18:35.181 --> 18:37.148
Well, I take my
responsibility seriously--

18:37.150 --> 18:38.583
Shh.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.351
You made your bed. I didn't
get a choice in mine.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.619
So you don't get to
judge me for a--

18:41.621 --> 18:42.820
( gasps )

18:42.822 --> 18:45.490
There's a pattern.

18:46.826 --> 18:50.394
Pattern, pattern.
Pattern, pattern.

18:50.396 --> 18:52.263
Circles inside squares
inside triangles.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.432
That's why I
have the headache.

18:54.434 --> 19:00.204
My brain knew that we were in a maze before
we even really noticed it ourselves.

19:00.206 --> 19:07.178
I can see it.
Kind of.

19:07.180 --> 19:11.249
Can you kind of
get us out of here?

19:11.251 --> 19:13.818
Oy! Whatever issues you two
are having, save it.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.154
I saw we follow
the brain grape.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.556
We are not calling
it a brain grape.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.891
( Creature roars )

19:19.893 --> 19:21.659
Follow the brain grape.
This way.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.335
Ha!

19:31.337 --> 19:32.937
Where next?

19:32.939 --> 19:36.707
Kind of more guessing than
knowing, but I guess this way.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.512
( Gunshots )

19:45.451 --> 19:47.518
One short, one long,
two short.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.887
What? Morse code?

19:49.889 --> 19:52.857
That's an L.
For librarians?

19:52.859 --> 19:55.193
It's Baird.
Let's go.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.728
Anyone else worried the monster
heard those gunshots, too?

19:57.730 --> 20:01.232
I'm hoping we
find Baird first.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.401
( Creature roars )

20:04.971 --> 20:06.704
( Gunshots )

20:22.855 --> 20:25.856
Human Resources. So safe.
So boring.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.900
( Creature roars )

20:34.901 --> 20:36.400
Go!

20:36.402 --> 20:38.469
We have to hold out
as long as we can!

20:38.471 --> 20:40.004
Well, I'll be damned.

20:40.006 --> 20:44.575
I did not think that would
work with a cabinet door.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.943
Go, go!

21:07.367 --> 21:13.904
Symbolic representation
of you in the Labyrinth.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.507
That's a trick I won't be
trying any time soon again.

21:16.509 --> 21:20.411
Ha. So. First time out.
How'd it go?

21:25.018 --> 21:26.517
As far as we can tell, ma'am,

21:26.519 --> 21:28.786
she doesn't see to
have disturbed anything.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.588
Why was she in here?

21:30.590 --> 21:33.791
She can't know what
we're doing unless-- no.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.693
There's only one librarian
and he was just spotted in--?

21:35.695 --> 21:37.995
Budapest, I think.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.298
Expedite the timetable
just in case.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.034
Start tomorrow, with that
blonde idiot at my desk.

21:43.036 --> 21:46.671
Honestly, how hard
is it to knock?

21:46.673 --> 21:48.973
And if these people
come back?

21:48.975 --> 21:51.008
They won't.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.878
Nobody escapes
the Labyrinth.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.314
It's the thread.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.748
The thread.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.884
What's all this other stuff?

21:59.886 --> 22:03.387
Magic has three parts.

22:03.389 --> 22:05.523
Power, to change reality.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.924
Focus to direct that change

22:06.926 --> 22:09.794
and an effect that change
in the real world.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.430
The effect would be
the Labyrinth, right?

22:12.432 --> 22:16.400
Created by the focus of
the Minoan artifacts.

22:16.402 --> 22:19.837
Mr. Stone, you have
a knack for this.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.039
But the power that holds
it all together,

22:22.041 --> 22:25.676
that's the original
thread in the myth.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.411
Millennia old.

22:27.413 --> 22:28.679
"Millennia" means
thousands of years--

22:28.681 --> 22:29.980
Yes, thank you.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.816
Once you take the thread out,

22:31.818 --> 22:34.652
it would be like taking
the battery out of a car.

22:34.654 --> 22:39.023
Yes. Crude analogy
but totally accurate.

22:39.025 --> 22:42.026
We destroy the thread and
the entire multi-dimensional

22:42.028 --> 22:45.830
hoo-ha collapses in
on itself with a whoosh.

22:45.832 --> 22:49.500
All we have to do is
get past that Minotaur.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.634
Everything I have on Minotaurs.

22:50.636 --> 22:53.137
Nasty creatures.
Hold a grudge.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.378
I put seven rounds into the
thing and it still got back up.

23:00.380 --> 23:04.014
There are many immortal beings that
can be injured but not killed.

23:04.016 --> 23:06.684
Nicolas Flamel.
The Wandering Jew.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.519
The Black Mask, the sources
reported him killed

23:08.521 --> 23:11.122
many times but he always
seems to pop up when needed.

23:11.124 --> 23:14.725
If I can't kill this thing,
what am I supposed to do?

23:14.727 --> 23:18.529
Colonel, the library chose
you for a reason and trust me,

23:18.531 --> 23:20.898
it wasn't because of
your ability to kill.

23:29.142 --> 23:32.009
We're not gonna
save Henry Birch.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.145
Well, then we get him justice.

23:34.147 --> 23:37.815
We're here to protect innocent
people from out-of-control magic.

23:37.817 --> 23:41.152
I say this qualifies.

23:41.154 --> 23:43.687
Golden Axe Foods has
the Labyrinth in its basement.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.189
Tell me why.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.557
Well the myth is that
the King imprisoned

23:46.559 --> 23:48.926
the Minotaur in the Labyrinth.

23:48.928 --> 23:53.464
Every seven years he sends down 14 virgins,
seven men, seven women, for sacrifice.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.733
Good luck finding
14 virgins these days.

23:55.735 --> 23:59.203
The Greek words for "virgin"
are eitheos and parthenos,

23:59.205 --> 24:01.505
they both literally mean
unmarried man and woman.

24:01.507 --> 24:05.209
You-- it could mean youth,
it could mean inexperienced--

24:05.211 --> 24:07.077
Interns.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.579
Okay? So in the myth,

24:08.581 --> 24:10.748
what did the King get
for his sacrifices?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.483
He gets power.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.819
He gets prosperity
and wealth.

24:14.821 --> 24:18.789
"Through war, famine and plague,
Golden Axe will always prevail".

24:18.791 --> 24:20.991
The myth calls for
fourteen sacrifices.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.893
They're gonna kill
six more people

24:22.895 --> 24:24.562
if we don't do
anything about it.

24:24.564 --> 24:27.998
Six more people are gonna be
screaming, run down by that.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.633
At least.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.469
I mean, this has been going
on for centuries,

24:31.471 --> 24:33.070
who's to say they're
ever going to stop?

24:33.072 --> 24:34.705
We have to get that thread.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.475
Have I mentioned, you know,
world class thief?

24:37.477 --> 24:40.811
Relentlessly.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.547
So the cases themselves
have some heavy-duty security.

24:43.549 --> 24:44.915
Taser nets are built in.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.750
Touch one of the cases
without deactivating

24:46.752 --> 24:50.621
the net and zap,
50,000 volts.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.923
But the trick is getting
back into that building,

24:52.925 --> 24:54.992
past that monster
and tunneling underground

24:54.994 --> 24:58.562
is obviously out
of the question--

24:58.564 --> 24:59.597
Guys?

25:04.003 --> 25:05.703
That's impossible.

25:05.705 --> 25:09.840
This is exactly like the
frescoes that were in the--

25:15.648 --> 25:18.182
We're back in the Labyrinth.

25:44.911 --> 25:48.045
Okay, so I've got a
phone signal, but no GPS.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.780
How is this happening?

25:49.782 --> 25:52.149
Sorry, could you tell me
where the nearest subway is?

25:52.151 --> 25:53.284
Sure.

25:53.286 --> 25:55.686
( Distorted voice )

26:00.960 --> 26:02.993
Thanks.

26:02.995 --> 26:03.995
Yes?

26:03.996 --> 26:06.564
Jenkins, quick question.

26:06.566 --> 26:09.646
We're on the street outside the annex but
we seem to be back in the Labyrinth.

26:10.136 --> 26:11.802
Huh.

26:11.804 --> 26:16.006
So, annoying or cryptic, those
are your two speeds, huh?

26:16.008 --> 26:19.777
It's possible the Labyrinth
isn't just a place,

26:19.779 --> 26:21.946
it is a lingering effect.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.347
Like a curse?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.683
Yes. The Labyrinth
won't let you out.

26:25.685 --> 26:29.186
It's confusing your senses,
warping space around you.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.789
It doesn't matter where you go,
you'll get lost,

26:31.791 --> 26:33.591
eventually wandering
back into its clutches.

26:33.593 --> 26:34.992
Fascinating.

26:34.994 --> 26:37.928
So how do we find the thread
and shut down the maze

26:37.930 --> 26:40.230
if we're stuck in the maze?

26:40.232 --> 26:42.866
Huh.

26:42.868 --> 26:48.105
If you say "huh" one
more time, so help me--

26:48.107 --> 26:49.740
( growls )

26:52.211 --> 26:55.045
Colonel Baird!
Colonel Baird?

27:01.754 --> 27:02.754
Run!

27:03.990 --> 27:06.256
( Snarls )

27:06.258 --> 27:08.258
Jenkins! The Minotaur's in
the maze with us!

27:08.260 --> 27:10.060
Get us out of here!

27:10.062 --> 27:12.730
I told you, I cannot pull
that trick off twice.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.131
Um...

27:14.133 --> 27:19.303
But perhaps I could use
the Labyrinth itself

27:19.305 --> 27:20.305
to buy you some time.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.006
He's right behind us!

27:22.008 --> 27:26.043
The Labyrinth confuses
the senses, distorts space.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.912
I can actually amplify
the effect.

27:28.914 --> 27:30.814
If I create
a dimensional bubble

27:30.816 --> 27:34.952
around you so confusing even
the Minotaur can't find you.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.320
For how long?

27:36.322 --> 27:37.721
Five minutes.

27:37.723 --> 27:40.424
Maybe less,
certainly not more.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.259
Good luck, Colonel.

27:42.261 --> 27:43.661
Oh, and run.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.330
Come on.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.668
Okay, stay calm.

27:50.670 --> 27:51.902
I've been in
worse spots than this before.

27:51.904 --> 27:52.903
Well, that
strains credibility.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.738
Stone, you take point.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.807
Ezekiel, watch the rear,
there's a high roof up there.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.008
There isn't.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.243
You heard what Jenkins said,

27:59.245 --> 28:01.011
the Labyrinth is just trying
to confuse us.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.680
Even it was there,
we couldn't reach it.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.214
It's not a suggestion,
it's an order.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.983
And I'm not a soldier!

28:09.422 --> 28:11.722
You're right.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.391
I am, but you're not.
You're librarians.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.294
Librarians win because
of what they know.

28:17.296 --> 28:20.731
So, what do you know?

28:20.733 --> 28:21.965
Come on, guys,
what do you know?

28:21.967 --> 28:23.367
Theseus.
Bloke from the story.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.102
He went into the maze
and killed the Minotaur.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.203
The Minotaur
can't be killed.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.905
Then how did he escape?

28:27.907 --> 28:30.874
You said the Minotaur was
imprisoned inside the Labyrinth.

28:30.876 --> 28:34.111
Every prison I've ever seen had a
control center inside the walls.

28:34.113 --> 28:37.114
Your man Theseus, maybe
he didn't go to the center

28:37.116 --> 28:38.816
to try and
kill the Minotaur--

28:38.818 --> 28:40.784
Maybe he went to the center
to pull the plug on the maze,

28:40.786 --> 28:42.386
same as us.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.755
You want to bet that maze
leads back to those artifacts?

28:44.757 --> 28:47.891
No, because I was in that
artifact room, I wasn't--

28:47.893 --> 28:49.359
keycard.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.895
I used that stolen keycard.

28:51.897 --> 28:55.299
The executive keycards keep them
from getting lost in the Labyrinth.

28:55.301 --> 28:59.069
We don't try to escape.
We go deeper in.

28:59.071 --> 29:02.406
I can get us to the center.

29:02.408 --> 29:05.275
My brain started trying to figure out
the maze when I was in it before.

29:05.277 --> 29:08.112
I've seen, experienced
more of it now.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.314
I bet I can get us through.

29:10.316 --> 29:11.915
Okay, Cassandra's our thread.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.051
Follow her.
Outrun the Minotaur,

29:14.053 --> 29:16.353
steal the power source for
the maze, shut it down.

29:16.355 --> 29:19.923
Librarians, we have a plan.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.895
The Labyrinth: Imagine
a building where every floor

29:24.897 --> 29:26.130
has a different layout.

29:26.132 --> 29:27.998
And sometimes, when you
walk around,

29:28.000 --> 29:31.802
you move between floors
without even knowing it.

29:31.804 --> 29:33.804
So from your perspective,
the layout looks different

29:33.806 --> 29:35.205
but if you know what
floor you're on,

29:35.207 --> 29:36.473
it makes perfect sense.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.275
Sure. Duh.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.277
I just need to know how many
floors are in the building.

29:40.279 --> 29:43.480
That number, all the core geometry
is gonna be based on that.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.215
- Without it--
- It should be seven.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.018
Seven's the number.
The myth is built on seven.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.486
Seven male victims.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.889
Seven female, sacrificed
every seven years.

29:51.891 --> 29:57.361
Seven. Seven is violet.

29:57.363 --> 30:00.230
Three seven-dimensional
polytypes:

30:00.232 --> 30:04.268
Seven simplex, seven-cube
and the seven-orthoplex.

30:04.270 --> 30:07.204
There aren't enough vertices.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.173
It's a demihepteract!

30:09.175 --> 30:11.041
Gotcha!

30:16.148 --> 30:19.216
Okay.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.484
Is this the way in?

30:20.486 --> 30:21.919
It's the way back
to the annex.

30:21.921 --> 30:25.155
Probably.
Maybe.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.523
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where are you going?

30:26.525 --> 30:28.325
We have to split up.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.561
And you don't want to be in
the Labyrinth when it goes poof.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.029
We're staying together. I'm not
letting you out of my sight again.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.164
If we stick together
he's got us.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.500
This doesn't work unless someone
distracts Mister Stompy.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.101
Fine, I'll distract him.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.870
On your own, you don't
stand a chance.

30:39.872 --> 30:43.540
And if he kills you,
then he's gonna chase us down.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.576
So we send these two in alone?

30:45.578 --> 30:48.478
Cassandra to find the center,
me to grab the thread.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.048
It's the only way.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.016
You can't protect us all.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.218
( Sighs )

30:54.220 --> 30:56.053
How much time do you need?

30:56.055 --> 30:58.889
Ten minutes to find the center.

30:58.891 --> 31:00.190
Five to crack the case
holding the thread.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.159
15 minutes. Check.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.161
Don't jump the gun.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.261
Don't lose the bull.

31:04.263 --> 31:07.898
And don't stray
off the path.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.067
Good hunting.
Remember, we do this--

31:10.069 --> 31:11.869
I know-- smarter, not harder.
I got it.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.404
Minotaur growls )

31:16.442 --> 31:18.141
Yo!

31:18.143 --> 31:19.143
( Whistles )

31:19.144 --> 31:20.510
Come on, boy.

31:26.018 --> 31:28.151
Okay, which way
to the center?

31:28.153 --> 31:29.219
That way.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.321
No, wait.
That way.

31:31.323 --> 31:32.356
You sure?

31:32.358 --> 31:36.426
Back off, I'm doing math.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.297
That way.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.001
He's gaining on us.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.502
Seven times seven
is forty-nine.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.237
Forty-nine times seven
is three-forty-three.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.440
Wait. It's here.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.476
It's right here.

31:56.181 --> 31:57.648
Good for math.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.416
This way!

32:00.686 --> 32:02.386
We're not gonna make it.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.087
What are you doing?

32:04.089 --> 32:05.489
I'll buy you as
much time as I can.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.024
- What?
- Go!

32:07.026 --> 32:09.059
No! Baird!

32:09.061 --> 32:10.994
( Roars )

32:20.139 --> 32:22.072
--Seven points on a heptagon--

32:22.074 --> 32:23.607
seven is a Mersenne prime,

32:23.609 --> 32:27.577
two to the third minus
one equals seven---

32:32.718 --> 32:33.984
I--

32:36.121 --> 32:37.121
I can't do it.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.256
No, I can't do it.

32:39.258 --> 32:42.526
Seven dimensions is--
it's too much. I can't.

32:42.528 --> 32:43.994
Seven's nothing.

32:43.996 --> 32:46.029
Leaves you with what,
three fingers?

32:46.031 --> 32:48.365
I once stole a gun out of a
cop's hand using three fingers.

32:48.367 --> 32:52.736
Stone was right.
You can't trust me.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.738
I'll let everyone down.

32:54.740 --> 32:59.643
( Sighs )

32:59.645 --> 33:01.144
If I was in your shoes,
with that thing

33:01.146 --> 33:02.612
growing in my head,

33:02.614 --> 33:05.549
I'd have sold everybody out
for a cure, too.

33:05.551 --> 33:08.318
The only difference is,
I would have stuck the landing.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.386
Let Flynn die.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.721
Let the serpent
brotherhood win.

33:10.723 --> 33:13.290
Let the world burn.
But you didn't.

33:13.292 --> 33:16.693
Yeah, you screwed people over
but you didn't let them down.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.695
I can't hold it though,
it's too much.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.264
So close your eyes.

33:21.266 --> 33:22.733
Focus on your other senses.

33:22.735 --> 33:26.336
My other senses and
I don't get along so well.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.005
Brain grape.

33:28.007 --> 33:29.573
So I'll be your other senses.

33:29.575 --> 33:32.309
Shut your eyes and
see the map inside your head.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.311
I'll lead you through.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.246
You really trust me
to do that?

33:36.248 --> 33:38.482
( Scoffs )

33:38.484 --> 33:41.184
I'm the thief that
bails on everybody.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.420
Pretty sure you're
the one trusting me.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.699
Okay.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.301
We need to go down
and to the left.

33:58.303 --> 34:03.173
That's good. Good.
Good.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.474
( Roars )

34:07.279 --> 34:08.779
( Grunts )

34:13.385 --> 34:16.152
Look at that.
Smarter and harder.

34:20.592 --> 34:25.295
You did it.
We made it.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.797
You okay?

34:26.799 --> 34:28.532
Yeah. Go.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.333
I just need to
count down from seven.

34:31.335 --> 34:34.737
Seven is violet,
six is indigo, five is blue--

34:34.739 --> 34:38.475
Shut down the tasers,
pop the case, grab the thread.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.110
Five minutes is all we need.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.545
You don't have it.

34:46.685 --> 34:50.219
Who are you?

34:50.222 --> 34:52.389
We're the librarians.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.424
We accept your surrender.

34:54.426 --> 34:58.595
There's only one librarian
and you are not him.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.565
But something has changed.

35:01.567 --> 35:05.602
There's more magic in the world,
more power to our sacrifices.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.871
Golden Axe, in one form
or another has been

35:07.873 --> 35:11.108
sacrificing innocents to
the Labyrinth for 3,000 years

35:11.110 --> 35:13.844
and we have never seen
a stock bump like we got

35:13.846 --> 35:15.245
off our last offering.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.722
We made it.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.390
Is it still behind us?

35:27.392 --> 35:30.894
Assume yes.

35:30.896 --> 35:35.332
You are the first modern
people to reach the center.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.434
No intern has
ever managed that.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.136
Kids today.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.338
There's no initiative!

35:41.340 --> 35:44.541
You are a more old-fashioned,

35:44.543 --> 35:46.776
ritual sacrifice
kind of person?

35:46.778 --> 35:49.579
I single-handedly
modernized the process.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.715
I said, "let's amortize".

35:51.717 --> 35:55.519
Spread the sacrifices out over the year
instead of doing them all at once.

35:55.521 --> 35:58.522
Increases the overhead but
the decrease in visibility

35:58.524 --> 36:02.159
means your return on investment is
even higher on a per-intern basis.

36:02.161 --> 36:04.294
Hey. You got to spend money
to make money.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.830
I get it. Let's say we all
part as friends--

36:06.832 --> 36:09.299
You know, I'm not sure
if shooting you here

36:09.301 --> 36:11.401
counts towards our fourteen

36:11.403 --> 36:13.904
or if the Minotaur has
to make the kill itself.

36:13.906 --> 36:18.508
I guess I'll find out tomorrow
when I see the market returns.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.510
Oh! Oh!

36:19.511 --> 36:20.644
( Gunshot )

36:26.318 --> 36:27.951
( Growls )

36:27.953 --> 36:29.486
Only two of you?

36:29.488 --> 36:31.188
I never thought they were
cut out for--

36:31.190 --> 36:32.589
( banging )

36:32.591 --> 36:35.659
Is that thing trying
to get into my annex?

36:35.661 --> 36:37.627
You led that back to my--?

36:37.629 --> 36:39.496
Not now!

36:44.603 --> 36:46.570
Hey! This is delicate.

36:49.408 --> 36:50.574
( Alarm rings )

36:50.576 --> 36:51.841
That's good, too.

37:13.498 --> 37:14.931
Come on, then.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.503
Give me that thread.

37:20.505 --> 37:21.938
If you drop it,
we're all doomed.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.306
Uh, any ideas?

37:23.308 --> 37:26.676
Hey, let's
be professional.

37:26.678 --> 37:27.844
I have the resources.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.480
You obviously
have the talent.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.815
Name your price.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.583
Double if you take it
in stock options.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.852
Jenkins.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.854
He said that magic
depends on symbols.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.589
What better symbol of
a Labyrinth than

37:39.591 --> 37:43.360
a straight line rapped around
and around and around itself?

37:43.362 --> 37:44.894
Here. Catch!

37:48.300 --> 37:50.900
( Rumbling )

37:58.310 --> 38:00.644
( Roars )

38:12.557 --> 38:15.458
The Labyrinth!
The Labyrinth!

38:15.460 --> 38:18.928
( Rushing wind )

38:18.930 --> 38:21.931
I believe I said
with a "whoosh".

38:21.933 --> 38:25.068
Cassandra, Jones!

38:25.070 --> 38:26.503
Whoa!

38:26.505 --> 38:27.570
Got it.

38:29.041 --> 38:30.807
Ha ha!

38:30.809 --> 38:31.908
( Wind rushes )

38:31.910 --> 38:33.610
Whoa!

38:45.957 --> 38:48.391
We made it.

38:48.393 --> 38:51.094
Yeah. You did.

38:51.096 --> 38:54.331
This time, you did.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.903
You should have seen her.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.771
No hiding. Took the fight
right to the big bad.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.406
And Ezekiel.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.709
He did kind of save
the day by bailing on me.

39:05.711 --> 39:09.346
I told you.
I don't do punchy.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.681
Well done.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.483
May I?

39:15.420 --> 39:17.053
Now without this to serve
as a power source,

39:17.055 --> 39:20.390
the Labyrinth should shrivel
up and wink out of existence.

39:20.392 --> 39:21.392
Eventually.

39:21.393 --> 39:22.892
We ought to lock that up.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.961
Yes. Well, we don't have
the facilities

39:24.963 --> 39:28.865
of the main library,
but I'll think of something.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.767
What about Willis?

39:30.769 --> 39:32.936
I mean, I know we stopped her,
but shouldn't she go to jail

39:32.938 --> 39:35.505
or something for what she did
to Henry Birch and the others?

39:35.507 --> 39:37.707
I wouldn't worry
about Ms. Willis.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.909
She imprisoned a Minotaur.

39:39.911 --> 39:43.480
Nasty creatures.
Hold a grudge.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.886
Those people do not know
who they're messing with.

39:49.888 --> 39:53.523
Librarians or not, we will
find them,

39:53.525 --> 39:56.025
destroy them
and get back what we--

39:56.027 --> 40:00.497
( roaring )

40:01.833 --> 40:02.833
( Stomping )

40:04.035 --> 40:06.770
( Roars )

40:21.920 --> 40:25.889
Hey.

40:25.891 --> 40:29.793
Look, um, things got a
little heated in there--

40:29.795 --> 40:31.728
Don't worry about it.

40:33.698 --> 40:35.098
I'm not.

40:39.104 --> 40:43.907
Kind of worried about
what you said to me.

40:43.909 --> 40:45.442
You know, if we're gonna
work together,

40:45.444 --> 40:46.443
you're gonna need to trust--

40:46.445 --> 40:50.747
Nobody knows.

40:50.749 --> 40:55.618
Nobody back home knows
about this.

40:57.489 --> 41:00.857
I have kept it a secret

41:00.859 --> 41:03.993
for twenty years.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.496
Why would you hide that?

41:08.467 --> 41:10.767
You're a genius,
you know about culture

41:10.769 --> 41:12.602
and art
and beautiful things.

41:12.604 --> 41:18.174
I told you before,
family ain't ever easy.

41:18.176 --> 41:21.678
For me...

41:21.680 --> 41:26.249
You don't--
No.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.084
That's enough for now.

41:31.790 --> 41:37.527
The point is, I'm used to
keeping my life separated.

41:37.529 --> 41:38.695
All right?

41:38.697 --> 41:41.931
My family, my friends,
I love 'em.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.199
I like 'em.

41:43.201 --> 41:46.769
No problem working
right along side of them.

41:46.771 --> 41:50.273
Any of them.

41:50.275 --> 41:55.845
But I don't trust a single
one of 'em to tell them...

41:58.517 --> 42:01.885
I mean, can you imagine
meeting Flynn,

42:01.887 --> 42:05.221
meeting you,

42:05.223 --> 42:08.758
meeting Baird

42:08.760 --> 42:11.961
and the thief.

42:14.266 --> 42:17.834
Finding out about
this library.

42:17.836 --> 42:20.670
Finding people
I could trust.

42:25.610 --> 42:27.777
Well, you know
how that felt?

42:27.779 --> 42:31.915
I do.
I really do.

42:33.151 --> 42:36.319
And then to have it broken?

42:38.957 --> 42:40.557
I like you, Cassie.

42:40.559 --> 42:46.029
There's no way around it,
I just do.

42:46.031 --> 42:48.197
But I trusted you and,

42:48.199 --> 42:52.168
uh, I learned my lesson.

42:52.170 --> 42:53.903
Not, it's not--

42:53.905 --> 42:58.107
look, it always
ends bad so--

43:00.612 --> 43:01.844
old way's best.

43:09.220 --> 43:13.156
So, end of day, not too bad
for a first time out, was it?

43:13.158 --> 43:14.757
You did okay.

43:14.759 --> 43:18.861
I, I could do better.

43:18.863 --> 43:22.999
I spent my entire adult life
in the military.

43:23.001 --> 43:24.601
Everybody fits into a box.

43:24.603 --> 43:26.202
You don't.

43:26.204 --> 43:29.872
You're not assets
to be protected,

43:29.874 --> 43:36.613
you're not soldiers
I can order around.

43:36.615 --> 43:38.982
I don't know what you are.

43:38.984 --> 43:42.752
Well, maybe the term you're
looking for is "partners".

43:49.995 --> 43:51.861
Fair enough.

43:51.863 --> 43:54.097
Can you go back to the part
where you said we were awesome?

43:54.099 --> 43:55.965
I said you did okay.

43:55.967 --> 43:58.234
Yeah, but I'm gonna
take that as "we rule."

43:58.236 --> 44:00.269
Mostly me.
You guys were okay.

44:00.271 --> 44:03.139
Okay? I did math.

44:03.141 --> 44:04.774
True. Points for math.

44:04.776 --> 44:08.011
Stone, though, you mostly
just got beat up.

44:12.250 --> 44:14.384
I do rule.
