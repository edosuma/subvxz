00:00.441 --> 00:03.951
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.688 --> 00:06.189
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.757 --> 00:10.025
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:10.093 --> 00:12.294
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.362 --> 00:14.696
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.764 --> 00:16.598
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.666 --> 00:19.401
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.469 --> 00:21.470
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.505 --> 00:23.972
<i>A trigger-happy girlfriend...</i>

00:24.040 --> 00:25.607
Should we shoot them?

00:25.675 --> 00:27.409
<i>...an old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:27.477 --> 00:30.178
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.246 --> 00:32.546
<i>...family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.615 --> 00:34.483
<i>...if you're desperate....</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:34.550 --> 00:37.619
<i>...and a down-and-out spy</i>
<i>you met along the way.</i>

00:37.687 --> 00:39.254
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.322 --> 00:41.923
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:41.991 --> 00:43.792
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:50.367 --> 00:51.801
I'm gonna get you out.

00:52.125 --> 00:53.770
We got a lead.

00:53.870 --> 00:56.471
If I get Anson, would that be
enough to get Fiona out of jail?

00:56.539 --> 00:58.340
It's a start.

00:58.408 --> 01:00.442
You don't want
to do this, Michael.

01:00.510 --> 01:01.843
Oh, yes, I do.

01:01.911 --> 01:02.844
Aah!

01:02.912 --> 01:03.645
Enough!

01:03.713 --> 01:04.980
It's a dead-man switch.

01:05.047 --> 01:06.214
If I drop this,

01:06.282 --> 01:07.549
you'll be scraping your friends
off the walls.

01:11.254 --> 01:12.687
I've been supplying Anson

01:12.755 --> 01:14.589
with travel documents
and cash

01:14.657 --> 01:15.924
every couple of weeks.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.392
I can tell you
the exact location

01:17.460 --> 01:18.760
of the hotel
in Atlantic City

01:18.828 --> 01:20.395
where he's
expecting his next drop.

01:20.463 --> 01:23.131
Anson will get
what he deserves.

01:23.199 --> 01:24.699
I promise you that.

01:28.237 --> 01:30.372
You know where Anson is?
Are you serious?

01:30.440 --> 01:33.308
I have a lead on where he's
going to be tomorrow night.

01:33.376 --> 01:35.310
But we can't
get ahead of ourselves.

01:35.378 --> 01:36.645
Even if he shows up --

01:36.712 --> 01:39.781
How?
How did you find him?

01:39.849 --> 01:43.318
I've been talking
to...Rebecca.

01:43.386 --> 01:46.421
Fi -- Fi, we have every reason
to believe her at this point.

01:46.489 --> 01:47.989
She tried
to have me killed.

01:48.057 --> 01:50.525
Trust me.
Anson was manipulating her.

01:50.593 --> 01:53.695
If anyone can appreciate
what that's like, <i>I</i> can.

01:53.763 --> 01:58.133
How can you be sure you're
not walking into another trap?

01:58.201 --> 01:59.668
I can't be sure
on this one.

01:59.735 --> 02:00.902
But I have to do it.

02:00.970 --> 02:03.004
If I can
put Anson in cuffs

02:03.072 --> 02:06.241
and you plead guilty
to a few weapons charges,

02:06.309 --> 02:08.643
your sentence
will be time served.

02:10.279 --> 02:11.413
It's your only chance.

02:12.982 --> 02:14.316
Time's up, Glenanne.

02:14.383 --> 02:16.051
Warden wants to see you.

02:16.118 --> 02:18.253
I trust you, Michael.

02:18.321 --> 02:21.022
But if you let that weasel
slip away again,

02:21.090 --> 02:24.192
I am gonna break out of here
just to kick your ass.

02:24.260 --> 02:25.393
Fair enough.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:37.540 --> 02:38.974
Ms. Glenanne,

02:39.041 --> 02:42.010
this is Mr. Thomas and Mr. Walsh
from the State Department.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.378
Uncuff her, please.

02:43.446 --> 02:46.047
Actually,
I'd prefer if you didn't.

02:46.115 --> 02:48.216
Arthur Meyers, MI6.

02:48.284 --> 02:50.685
So pleased to meet you.

02:55.658 --> 02:57.092
What is this?

02:57.159 --> 02:59.728
That is a rather
complicated question, isn't it?

02:59.795 --> 03:02.931
We've been monitoring your
activities for quite some time.

03:02.999 --> 03:05.033
Honestly, we were hoping
all this would end

03:05.101 --> 03:07.102
with a needle
full of potassium chloride.

03:07.169 --> 03:10.939
Seemed rather just, in light
of your past affiliation

03:11.007 --> 03:13.141
with the Irish
Republican Army.

03:13.209 --> 03:15.076
I left the army
because of their tactics.

03:15.144 --> 03:17.012
I never hurt a civilian --
then or now.

03:17.079 --> 03:19.247
Let's not quibble
about the past.

03:19.315 --> 03:21.216
Let's talk about the future.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.051
Well, I don't see how you'll
have a damn thing to say about it.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.253
Well, then let me
help you see it.

03:25.321 --> 03:27.088
We've been granted
a few hours of your time --

03:27.156 --> 03:28.290
tomorrow from 1:00 to 4:00.

03:28.357 --> 03:30.325
You'll be driven
to our new consulate,

03:30.393 --> 03:32.327
and you and I
are gonna have a little chat

03:32.395 --> 03:34.029
about how you bombed
the old one.

03:34.096 --> 03:35.397
You think
I'm gonna talk to you?

03:35.464 --> 03:36.765
I don't expect so, no.

03:36.832 --> 03:38.700
But the light there
is exquisite,

03:38.768 --> 03:42.137
and you'll look lovely
on camera.

03:42.204 --> 03:44.005
If you leak
that I'm in British custody,

03:44.073 --> 03:46.608
there are people in Ireland
who will go after my family.

03:46.676 --> 03:48.543
You'll be putting
innocent people in danger.

03:48.611 --> 03:49.811
Their lives will be --

03:49.879 --> 03:51.513
Over. Yeah.
That <i>is</i> one option.

03:51.581 --> 03:53.949
The other option is if you sign
a new confession --

03:54.016 --> 03:57.619
a full confession --
and we squash the CIA business.

03:59.155 --> 04:01.790
Take the night
to think it over.

04:01.857 --> 04:02.824
Sleep well.

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

04:19.072 --> 04:22.107
Seven phone calls, four texts,
and two cryptic e-mails,

04:22.175 --> 04:23.509
all to set up

04:23.577 --> 04:25.544
an urgent cloak-and-dagger
meeting in the woods.

04:25.612 --> 04:27.947
I think you enjoy being a spy
a little too much, Michael.

04:28.014 --> 04:29.481
I think you need a hobby,
and I --

04:29.549 --> 04:31.116
I know where we can find
Anson Fullerton.

04:31.184 --> 04:32.918
Excuse me?

04:32.986 --> 04:35.087
He's been getting cash
and fresh travel documents

04:35.155 --> 04:36.255
every couple of weeks.

04:36.823 --> 04:38.590
He's picking up
a new package tomorrow

04:38.658 --> 04:40.359
in a motel
in Atlantic City.

04:40.426 --> 04:42.527
And how do you know this?
The point is, I know it.

04:42.595 --> 04:43.628
Hold on, Michael.

04:43.696 --> 04:45.530
We've cut off
every bank account,

04:45.598 --> 04:48.400
every known associate,
every line of support Anson had.

04:48.468 --> 04:50.168
Who's helping him?

04:50.236 --> 04:52.196
My source on this is
confidential, but I can vouch --

04:52.221 --> 04:53.305
It's Rebecca.

04:53.306 --> 04:55.407
She's the only one of
his contacts still in the wind.

04:55.475 --> 04:56.775
And you found her,
didn't you?

04:56.843 --> 04:58.810
You tracked down
a traitor to this Agency,

04:58.878 --> 05:00.579
and you didn't even
tell me about it?!

05:00.646 --> 05:01.980
I did what I had to do.

05:02.048 --> 05:04.416
Do you want to reprimand me
for not following protocol,

05:04.484 --> 05:06.051
or do you
want to catch this guy?

05:06.119 --> 05:07.686
Honestly? Both.

05:07.754 --> 05:09.087
Well,
one of them can wait.

05:09.155 --> 05:10.956
We have hours, not days.
And we have to keep this quiet.

05:11.023 --> 05:12.124
So I want to use my people.

05:12.191 --> 05:13.725
No.
I'm running this op.

05:13.793 --> 05:16.194
You came here
because you need CIA resources.

05:16.262 --> 05:18.130
If you want to pick the team,
fine.

05:18.197 --> 05:19.631
But not Sam.

05:19.699 --> 05:22.601
If he's in the mix and we
come up empty-handed again,

05:22.668 --> 05:25.237
every one of my bosses
will line up to kick me.

05:25.304 --> 05:27.973
It's the Agency's loss.
Sam is as good as I am.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.308
And he accepts domestic beer
as payment.

05:30.376 --> 05:31.743
I'll put a note
in his file.

05:38.184 --> 05:39.418
I don't get to go?!

05:39.485 --> 05:40.786
I'm sorry, Sam.

05:40.853 --> 05:42.721
Come on!

05:42.789 --> 05:45.891
I've been helping you slog
through this burn notice garbage

05:45.958 --> 05:47.325
for how many years now?

05:47.393 --> 05:49.027
And I don't
get to be there

05:49.095 --> 05:51.930
when you finally put the wraps
on the last bastard standing?

05:51.998 --> 05:53.832
I told them
that they were making a mistake.

05:53.900 --> 05:54.966
But you know how it is.

05:55.034 --> 05:58.537
You, the Agency...
You.

05:58.604 --> 05:59.938
I'm not even sure

06:00.006 --> 06:01.907
you should be using
their people on this, Mike.

06:01.974 --> 06:03.875
Who knows where
Anson has ears in D.C.?

06:03.943 --> 06:06.578
That's why we're keeping it
as tight as possible.

06:06.646 --> 06:08.246
Exactly. I mean, why do you
think he's letting <i>me</i> come?

06:10.283 --> 06:12.918
He gets to go?
Wow. Okay. That's a little harsh.

06:12.985 --> 06:15.587
I'm just helping with transpo,
keep the head count down.

06:15.655 --> 06:18.123
And besides, no one knows
Atlantic City better than I do.

06:18.191 --> 06:20.392
I drove a limo up there
and gambled.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.060
Mostly I...gambled.

06:22.128 --> 06:24.830
I hate to ask,

06:24.897 --> 06:26.331
but do you think you can keep
an eye on my mom?

06:26.399 --> 06:27.466
Oh, you mean
she's not handling

06:27.533 --> 06:28.300
surveillance
and communications?

06:29.602 --> 06:31.203
Yes, I'll do it. Fine.

06:31.270 --> 06:32.637
Thank you.

06:32.705 --> 06:33.905
Knock 'em dead, boys.

06:44.784 --> 06:48.620
<i>In any prison, contraband</i>
<i>is the rule, not the exception.</i>

06:48.688 --> 06:50.589
<i>Candy, alcohol, even weapons</i>

06:50.656 --> 06:52.824
<i>are available</i>
<i>at a steep mark-up.</i>

06:52.892 --> 06:54.926
<i>But there are still some things</i>

06:54.994 --> 06:57.929
<i>that no amount of cash,</i>
<i>credits, or cigarettes</i>

06:57.997 --> 06:58.930
<i>will buy you.</i>

06:58.998 --> 07:00.499
Ayn, I need something.

07:03.970 --> 07:04.903
I need to disappear.

07:08.574 --> 07:09.808
Wait.
You're not kidding?

07:11.344 --> 07:13.144
Honey, if I had a secret door
out of here,

07:13.212 --> 07:14.913
don't you think
I'd have used it by now?

07:14.981 --> 07:16.948
I'm not talking
about actually breaking out.

07:17.016 --> 07:18.149
I just need it
to look like I did.

07:18.217 --> 07:19.451
Back up, criminal.

07:19.519 --> 07:22.020
I thought you had this whole
CIA exit strategy.

07:22.088 --> 07:23.255
Yeah, well, apparently

07:23.322 --> 07:24.556
the English government
heard about it,

07:24.624 --> 07:25.891
and there's a...British spy

07:25.958 --> 07:27.759
who's intent on making my life
a living hell.

07:27.827 --> 07:29.861
Right.
Well, we all been <i>there.</i>

07:29.929 --> 07:32.564
You have half the guards
on payroll here.

07:32.632 --> 07:35.500
Surely one of them
can just stash me somewhere.

07:35.568 --> 07:37.235
In a word?

07:37.303 --> 07:38.637
Hell no.

07:41.407 --> 07:43.275
But I might be able

07:43.342 --> 07:45.410
to arrange for you to have
a little privacy --

07:45.478 --> 07:47.779
if you can make it
worth my while.

07:47.847 --> 07:49.114
That's a big "if."

07:53.586 --> 07:55.654
Are you interested
in an early release?

07:58.558 --> 08:00.926
Don't come in here
selling magic beans, girl.

08:00.993 --> 08:03.995
No beans.
Just leverage.

08:04.063 --> 08:05.830
I'm a high-value prisoner.

08:05.898 --> 08:07.032
They're gonna miss me
when I'm gone.

08:07.099 --> 08:08.066
And?

08:08.134 --> 08:09.568
And if you hide me,

08:09.635 --> 08:12.337
I think it's only fair
that you be the one to find me.

08:14.173 --> 08:15.740
Oh, you're right.

08:15.808 --> 08:20.245
That kind of cooperation could
knock years off my sentence.

08:20.313 --> 08:22.814
Damn, girl,
you're diabolical.

08:25.151 --> 08:26.785
Then let's go down
first thing in the morning,

08:26.852 --> 08:27.786
right after breakfast.

08:27.853 --> 08:29.120
Yeah, I can work that.

08:29.188 --> 08:30.789
But this thing
won't hold up long.

08:30.856 --> 08:33.424
I'll give it a day,
maybe two.

08:33.491 --> 08:37.227
With any luck,
that's all I'll need.

08:45.905 --> 08:49.674
<i>When the CIA plans the capture</i>
<i>of a high-value target,</i>

08:49.742 --> 08:51.810
<i>no expense is spared.</i>

08:51.877 --> 08:54.846
<i>Directional microphones,</i>
<i>fiber-optic cameras,</i>

08:54.914 --> 08:59.050
<i>taser guns --</i>
<i>all the toys come out.</i>

08:59.118 --> 09:00.885
Blue team, copy back
if you're set.

09:00.953 --> 09:01.820
- Copy.
- Copy.

09:01.887 --> 09:03.221
Look at him.

09:03.289 --> 09:04.923
He's like
a kid in a candy store.

09:04.991 --> 09:07.292
You guys don't know
how spoiled you are.

09:22.642 --> 09:24.909
Can somebody tell me the story
with 111?

09:24.977 --> 09:27.445
Um, well, t-this is
kind of awkward, Mike.

09:27.513 --> 09:29.948
That's what a party
looks like.

09:30.016 --> 09:32.617
Well, it won't be long
before the cops get invited.

09:32.685 --> 09:34.719
Not the kind of welcome mat
we want to lay out for Anson.

09:34.787 --> 09:37.522
How much petty cash do we have?
We can pay them to leave.

09:37.590 --> 09:39.557
Fast and easy --
I did it once in Beirut.

09:39.625 --> 09:40.692
Oh, hold on.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.627
We got Nate Westen
to the rescue.

09:42.695 --> 09:46.431
Hey, whose room is this?

09:46.499 --> 09:48.199
- Damn it.
- What the hell is he doing?

09:48.267 --> 09:50.201
What you think you're
doing, dude? You're in my ride.

09:50.269 --> 09:52.103
Oh, yes.
I'm very sorry about that.

09:52.171 --> 09:53.371
And I will be brief.

09:53.439 --> 09:54.806
We're gonna need
all your linens.

09:54.874 --> 09:56.107
What'd you say?

09:56.175 --> 09:58.243
Well, I'm the assistant manager.
And -- oh!

09:58.310 --> 09:59.844
This is Manny.

09:59.912 --> 10:02.313
And unfortunately -- and I don't
want to alarm anyone --

10:02.381 --> 10:05.250
but we've had
a massive bedbug infestation.

10:05.317 --> 10:07.018
Bedbugs?
Bedbugs.

10:07.086 --> 10:08.953
You serious right now?

10:09.021 --> 10:12.257
Yo! Farrah! Bova!
We gots to roll, kids.

10:12.324 --> 10:14.025
Manny says the place
got bedbugs.

10:14.093 --> 10:17.595
I ain't payin' for the room.
You can forget that, yo.

10:17.663 --> 10:18.797
Yes, I understand.

10:18.864 --> 10:21.366
And I'm very sorry
for the inconvenience.

10:21.434 --> 10:24.269
They gonna roll, yo.

10:24.336 --> 10:26.071
You're welcome.
What the hell was that?

10:26.138 --> 10:27.972
You like that?
It was actually a true story.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.942
One time when I was
on the strip and I had these --

10:31.010 --> 10:33.578
You drive. That's what you do --
nothing else.

10:33.646 --> 10:34.913
It worked, okay?

10:34.980 --> 10:37.148
Yeah.
What if it worked too well?

10:37.216 --> 10:39.484
You want the entire motel
to clear out?

10:39.552 --> 10:42.554
Anson would know something's
wrong from down the block.

10:42.621 --> 10:43.822
Okay, Mike.

10:43.889 --> 10:45.390
Sorry.

10:52.965 --> 10:54.699
<i>In any covert operation,</i>

10:54.767 --> 10:57.035
<i>the closer</i>
<i>you get to your goal,</i>

10:57.103 --> 10:59.971
<i>the more collateral damage</i>
<i>tends to arise.</i>

11:00.039 --> 11:02.941
<i>Just because you're dealing</i>
<i>with one situation in a city</i>

11:03.008 --> 11:05.076
<i>hundreds of miles away</i>
<i>doesn't mean that another one</i>

11:05.144 --> 11:06.945
<i>won't show up on your doorstep</i>
<i>back home.</i>

11:07.012 --> 11:08.580
Open up. Open up.

11:08.647 --> 11:09.914
Aah!

11:09.982 --> 11:11.416
Sam, no!

11:11.484 --> 11:12.851
Barry?
Jesus.

11:12.918 --> 11:14.719
Who answers the door
like that?

11:14.787 --> 11:16.321
Where's Mike?
I need Mike.

11:16.388 --> 11:18.056
Whoa.
What the hell happened with you?

11:18.124 --> 11:21.126
Ugh.
I got shot.

11:26.098 --> 11:27.866
Are you sure
that that's sanitary?

11:27.933 --> 11:30.335
It's not very sanitary,
but it'll stop the bleeding.

11:30.402 --> 11:31.736
You barely got grazed.

11:31.804 --> 11:34.272
Would you calm down
and just tell us what happened?

11:34.340 --> 11:35.340
Okay.

11:35.407 --> 11:36.941
I'm having
my midday mojito.

11:37.009 --> 11:39.911
I look over, and I see a gaggle
of Fiona's old gun buddies.

11:39.979 --> 11:41.312
I barely
got out of there.

11:41.380 --> 11:42.781
Who are these people?

11:42.848 --> 11:46.251
Um, you know how we're
doing a lot to get Fi out?

11:46.318 --> 11:48.853
Uh, we might have
pissed off this, um...

11:48.921 --> 11:52.056
Major weapons dealer.

11:52.124 --> 11:53.324
What does that
have to do with <i>him?</i>

11:53.392 --> 11:54.826
It shouldn't have
anything to do with me.

11:54.894 --> 11:58.830
But I handle all the money
for Fi's deals.

11:58.898 --> 12:01.900
So the FBI said, "We'll offer
you immunity if you cooperate."

12:01.967 --> 12:03.635
And I was like,
"I got to think about it,"

12:03.702 --> 12:05.236
which is why
I need to talk to Mike.

12:05.304 --> 12:07.038
I'm sorry.
Am -- am I missing something?

12:07.106 --> 12:09.073
Why didn't you just
go to the FBI, all right?

12:09.141 --> 12:10.775
Let them protect you.
Take their deal.

12:10.843 --> 12:11.943
Yeah, well, I know.

12:12.011 --> 12:13.511
I would,
but except that if I did that,

12:13.579 --> 12:14.813
then they'd go
pick up my books,

12:14.880 --> 12:16.414
and then every single one
of my clients

12:16.482 --> 12:17.949
would have a matching set
of bracelets,

12:18.017 --> 12:19.517
including your son and...

12:19.585 --> 12:20.885
Oh, come on.

12:20.953 --> 12:22.720
You said those tax shelters
were totally legal.

12:22.788 --> 12:25.490
Yeah, Sam, what part of that
sounds totally legal?

12:25.558 --> 12:26.825
"Tax shelter"?

12:26.892 --> 12:28.893
I'm not gonna let anything
bad happen. I promise you.

12:28.961 --> 12:30.562
I just need
to go get those files

12:30.629 --> 12:33.131
that are germane to the issue
at hand, you understand?

12:33.199 --> 12:35.400
Okay, so go do it.
I can't!

12:35.467 --> 12:38.636
Listen, I keep all of my stuff
up at my client's lake house.

12:38.704 --> 12:40.572
Now, they're gonna be looking
for my car.

12:40.639 --> 12:41.906
So I'm gonna need a ride.

12:41.974 --> 12:43.308
I'm gonna need
a little backup.

12:45.778 --> 12:47.445
Maddy,
are you okay here?

12:47.513 --> 12:50.381
Yeah, there's
a "Real Housewives" marathon.

12:50.449 --> 12:52.550
I'll draw the blinds
and stay in.

12:56.789 --> 12:57.856
Let's go.
Ow!

12:57.923 --> 12:59.524
Try not to bleed in my car.

13:17.977 --> 13:18.977
This way, Sam.

13:19.044 --> 13:20.378
Some spot.

13:20.446 --> 13:22.146
I didn't realize
you had clients

13:22.214 --> 13:24.282
who were actually,
you know, successful.

13:24.350 --> 13:27.318
Yeah. Well, I'm more than just
great hair and good looks, Sam.

13:30.155 --> 13:32.023
Go ahead. Go ahead.

13:33.626 --> 13:34.792
It's over here.

13:34.860 --> 13:37.295
Hey, seriously,
what does this guy do?

13:37.363 --> 13:40.899
Data mining and derivatives
and basically screwing over

13:40.966 --> 13:43.601
a whole bunch of people
in Malaysia.

13:43.669 --> 13:45.370
Will you check that closet
for a box?

13:45.437 --> 13:46.804
He is not a nice dude.

13:46.872 --> 13:49.974
However, he does let me
stash my "iffy" files here

13:50.042 --> 13:52.076
in exchange
for free tax advice.

13:52.144 --> 13:54.012
I need this.

13:54.079 --> 13:56.247
All right,
so I'm gonna take all this.

13:56.315 --> 13:57.282
Ow.

13:57.349 --> 13:58.549
And that.

13:58.617 --> 13:59.851
And, uh...

13:59.919 --> 14:01.819
bingo.

14:01.887 --> 14:02.553
We're out.

14:05.491 --> 14:06.524
Why are you pointing
at it?

14:06.592 --> 14:10.428
W--
because I'm injured, Sam.

14:10.496 --> 14:13.131
I'm sorry I got shot.

14:17.770 --> 14:19.904
Uh, Barry, stop walking

14:19.972 --> 14:21.342
and pat your pockets
like you forgot your keys.

14:21.343 --> 14:22.029
What?

14:22.054 --> 14:24.358
The S.U.V. on the street
wasn't there when we got here.

14:24.610 --> 14:26.077
I'm thinking
that the guy behind the wheel,

14:26.145 --> 14:28.913
who's not looking at us,
has a rifle in his lap.

14:31.984 --> 14:34.052
Aah! I'm hit!

14:35.354 --> 14:37.422
Get in there!

14:39.992 --> 14:41.125
You all right?

14:41.193 --> 14:43.227
No, I'm not all right.
I got shot in the leg!

14:43.295 --> 14:44.629
Looks like a flesh wound.

14:44.697 --> 14:47.565
Yeah, well, whatever.
It's twice in one day!

14:47.633 --> 14:49.801
This has got to stop!

14:51.270 --> 14:53.071
Sorry, Barry.

14:53.138 --> 14:54.939
I'm pretty sure
this is just starting.

15:01.148 --> 15:04.050
Ugh! Aah! Ow!
Aah! Ngh!

15:04.118 --> 15:05.551
How is it?

15:05.619 --> 15:07.687
You're gonna be fine.
It's a through-and-through.

15:07.755 --> 15:09.522
If we live,
you can put a hoop though it.

15:09.590 --> 15:10.757
<i>If</i> we live?

15:10.824 --> 15:12.959
Barry, there's four guys outside
with guns.

15:14.361 --> 15:16.462
That's a lot.

15:16.530 --> 15:18.097
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

15:18.165 --> 15:19.365
Do you have any bars?

15:19.433 --> 15:22.235
No, man, there's no cell service
out here at all.

15:22.302 --> 15:24.737
Well, it's the main reason why
I asked my client to use his place.

15:24.805 --> 15:26.506
There's no cell service.
There's no Internet service.

15:26.573 --> 15:31.744
It's the only way to -- ow! --
Keep data safe from hackers.

15:31.812 --> 15:33.813
Ugh!

15:33.881 --> 15:36.315
Oh, damn it.
They cut the phone lines.

15:36.383 --> 15:38.451
You think any neighbors
heard that shot?

15:38.519 --> 15:40.520
I don't know. It's all
vacation houses up here.

15:40.587 --> 15:41.988
I think we're probably
on our own.

15:42.056 --> 15:43.623
Okay. I need a beer.

15:43.691 --> 15:44.791
Come on, man.

15:44.893 --> 15:46.368
I'm gonna need you
to keep it together.

15:46.369 --> 15:48.337
I can't deal with these guys
alone.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.571
What are you talking about?

15:49.639 --> 15:51.206
You can't deal with these guys
at <i>all.</i>

15:51.274 --> 15:52.841
I'm making a fake
marshal's badge.

15:52.909 --> 15:55.344
If we can't call the cops,
I've got to <i>be</i> the cops.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.780
So I need your wallet,
some scissors, and a glass.

16:01.351 --> 16:02.451
What's the glass for?

16:02.519 --> 16:03.719
We don't waste beer
in my family.

16:07.624 --> 16:08.857
The guys that Fi
rolled over on --

16:08.925 --> 16:10.859
you recognize any of 'em?

16:10.927 --> 16:12.227
Yeah. Garret Hartley.

16:12.295 --> 16:14.997
I think he's the vice president
of killing people.

16:15.065 --> 16:17.132
The guy's
a cold-blooded son of a bitch.

16:23.573 --> 16:24.706
You were right.

16:24.774 --> 16:27.276
Stack of mail in the box
next door.

16:27.343 --> 16:29.378
Yeah.
You hear that, bitches?

16:29.446 --> 16:31.313
We got all the time
in the world. No rushing.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.714
No more excuses.

16:32.782 --> 16:34.950
Now, here's what I want --

16:35.018 --> 16:37.386
Attention! Drop your weapons
and put your hands up.

16:40.924 --> 16:42.724
That's funny.

16:42.792 --> 16:44.526
You're funny.
I'm not joking.

16:44.594 --> 16:47.429
This is Chuck Finley,
U.S. Marshals Service.

16:47.497 --> 16:50.432
We've got a team inside
the house and backup on the way.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.967
Surrender now
and you will not be charged

16:52.035 --> 16:54.236
with threatening
law-enforcement personnel.

16:54.304 --> 16:57.172
Very generous, Mr. Finley,
but I'm gonna have to say no.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.374
We know who you are,
Mr. Hartley.

16:59.442 --> 17:00.542
Be smart.

17:00.610 --> 17:02.878
How do you think
this is gonna end?

17:02.946 --> 17:06.248
If you know who I am,
then you know how this ends.

17:06.316 --> 17:08.083
I'm here
to kill Barry Burkowski.

17:08.151 --> 17:10.752
Do yourself a favor.
Send him out.

17:10.819 --> 17:12.820
We tried
to be reasonable.

17:12.888 --> 17:14.923
Remember that.

17:16.559 --> 17:19.161
Go check out the main road.

17:19.229 --> 17:20.963
See if
he's telling the truth.

17:26.002 --> 17:27.136
Hey, it's working.

17:27.203 --> 17:28.737
Uh, actually, it's not.

17:28.805 --> 17:30.739
We just bought ourselves
a few minutes to get ready.

17:30.807 --> 17:32.641
But he's leaving.
He's checking out our story.

17:32.709 --> 17:34.343
Believe me, they're gonna
storm the joint

17:34.410 --> 17:36.445
as soon as that S.U.V. comes back.
Ugh!

17:36.513 --> 17:39.448
You know, I really can't deal
with your negativity right now.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.151
Barry, what kind of outside
lighting does this house have?

17:43.786 --> 17:46.155
<i>The motion sensor</i>
<i>in a backyard floodlight</i>

17:46.222 --> 17:48.223
<i>works by measuring</i>
<i>infrared heat.</i>

17:48.291 --> 17:49.925
<i>When a change is detected,</i>

17:49.993 --> 17:53.295
<i>it triggers a charge</i>
<i>in two electrical leads</i>

17:53.363 --> 17:54.863
<i>that turn on the lights.</i>

17:54.931 --> 17:56.899
<i>With a little</i>
<i>creative re-wiring,</i>

17:56.966 --> 18:01.170
<i>that same spark</i>
<i>can transform a shotgun shell</i>

18:01.237 --> 18:03.872
<i>into a primitive,</i>
<i>motion-activated zip gun.</i>

18:06.843 --> 18:08.677
Okay.

18:08.745 --> 18:10.846
Now we got a little buddy
to guard the back door.

18:10.914 --> 18:11.947
Hey, listen.

18:12.015 --> 18:13.348
Um, that was neat and all,
but, uh,

18:13.416 --> 18:15.250
I don't think your robot
can protect us.

18:15.318 --> 18:17.486
Do you see all the guns
that Garret brought?

18:17.554 --> 18:19.555
Don't you worry.

18:19.622 --> 18:22.624
When that S.U.V. comes back,
we'll be ready.

18:25.762 --> 18:28.363
<i>One of the hardest parts</i>
<i>in any takedown operation</i>

18:28.431 --> 18:30.399
<i>is waiting</i>
<i>for the target to show.</i>

18:30.466 --> 18:32.334
<i>There's nothing to do</i>
<i>but wait and watch,</i>

18:32.402 --> 18:34.203
<i>knowing</i>
<i>that even the smallest mistake</i>

18:34.270 --> 18:36.405
<i>can ruin everything.</i>

18:39.142 --> 18:41.410
Michael,
we have a visitor.

18:41.477 --> 18:42.611
Anson?

18:42.679 --> 18:44.213
Not quite.
Looks like a delivery guy.

18:45.348 --> 18:46.982
Sweet. The pizza's here.

18:47.050 --> 18:49.151
I hope you guys
like Hawaiian-style.

18:49.219 --> 18:52.287
Oh, Jess, do me a favor and
let the guys know -- dinner.

18:52.355 --> 18:55.357
Hey, hey!
What's up? Sweet!

18:55.425 --> 18:58.560
All right, it's $42, right?
And there you got 50 bucks.

18:58.628 --> 19:00.395
Keep the change.
Right on, man.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.032
Damn it, Nate!

19:04.100 --> 19:06.835
That's the second time you've
jeopardized this operation!

19:06.903 --> 19:08.070
What?

19:08.137 --> 19:09.538
I-I just got pizza.
I did something nice.

19:09.606 --> 19:12.174
Who orders four pizzas
to a motel room?

19:12.242 --> 19:13.942
Why don't you just
hang a sign on the door --

19:14.010 --> 19:15.110
"sting in progress"?!

19:15.178 --> 19:16.878
Okay,
I really doubt anybody --

19:16.946 --> 19:18.747
I can't keep
cleaning up after you!

19:18.815 --> 19:21.183
Not on this one!

19:23.853 --> 19:25.621
You need to go.

19:25.688 --> 19:28.690
I mean it.
Out the back. Now.

19:28.758 --> 19:29.958
Fine.

19:38.901 --> 19:41.470
Look, Mike, I get it, but that
was a little harsh, man.

19:41.537 --> 19:42.971
I mean,
he's your brother.

19:43.039 --> 19:44.840
Fiona's life is on the line,
Jess.

19:44.907 --> 19:46.742
I can't have Nate --

19:46.809 --> 19:49.978
there is no margin for error
on this.

19:50.046 --> 19:51.780
Yeah.

19:58.288 --> 20:02.391
Guard Rodriguez, call 776.

20:02.458 --> 20:05.327
Nice touch.
Cheaper than a lookout.

20:05.395 --> 20:06.662
More reliable.

20:06.729 --> 20:09.064
Never met a cup of rocks
that would betray me.

20:09.132 --> 20:10.599
Inmate 239...

20:10.667 --> 20:14.069
You're about to see why
I got myself on library detail.

20:19.442 --> 20:24.579
I had my guard on cell block "D"
kill their AC unit.

20:24.647 --> 20:26.214
Nobody's gonna miss this.

20:26.282 --> 20:29.051
Strip check "B,"
to the office.

20:29.118 --> 20:31.520
Strip check "B,"
to the office.

20:31.587 --> 20:35.223
Come on. We gotta make room
for your bony ass.

20:35.291 --> 20:39.628
Just me and a year's
supply of menthols, huh?

20:39.696 --> 20:41.530
Hey.

20:41.597 --> 20:42.831
You get claustrophobic,

20:42.899 --> 20:44.733
you bite your knuckle
and keep it to yourself.

20:44.801 --> 20:46.735
If you get busted
before I can play the hero,

20:46.803 --> 20:48.937
I'll be out of business
for nothing.

20:49.005 --> 20:50.572
You can save
the pep talk.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.874
I have more riding on this
than you do.

20:52.942 --> 20:54.543
Lunch call, ladies!

20:54.610 --> 20:55.610
Line up! Let's go!

20:55.678 --> 20:57.045
Line up!

20:57.113 --> 20:59.114
You heard her --
lunch call. Stand up. Come on.

20:59.182 --> 21:01.583
Guard Johnson
to the east gate.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.085
Guard Johnson
to the east gate.

21:03.152 --> 21:05.153
Glenanne.

21:05.221 --> 21:07.456
Glenanne,
get out here right now!

21:17.867 --> 21:19.468
<i>All personnel</i>
<i>to cell block "D."</i>

21:19.535 --> 21:20.702
<i>Code black. Code black.</i>

21:20.770 --> 21:23.205
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

21:29.112 --> 21:30.812
I can't die.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.647
I've never climbed
Kilimanjaro.

21:32.715 --> 21:34.316
I've never seen "The Wire."

21:34.384 --> 21:36.075
I've never even
had a four-way.

21:36.076 --> 21:36.767
I've never --

21:36.792 --> 21:38.792
I've never strangled a friend
in cold blood before,

21:39.055 --> 21:39.921
but it's early.

21:41.391 --> 21:43.158
It's back.

21:43.226 --> 21:45.627
The vehicle with all the guns --
the death-mobile.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.696
Looks like
they're getting organized.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.331
Get the mortar, Barry.
Let's go.

21:50.833 --> 21:53.235
Is calling it that
supposed to make me feel better?

21:53.302 --> 21:55.103
You know,
it's just a beer can

21:55.171 --> 21:57.706
with aquarium cleaner
and sugar and --

21:57.774 --> 22:00.475
I know what I'm doing.
Does <i>that</i> make you feel better?

22:00.543 --> 22:03.145
Let's do it.

22:06.916 --> 22:08.450
Hey,
how long is it gonna take

22:08.518 --> 22:11.553
for you to get this boomstick thing ready?
A minute.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.388
Minute? I don't think
we have a minute, man.

22:13.456 --> 22:14.589
They're coming.

22:16.325 --> 22:18.427
Mr. Hartley,
before you take another step,

22:18.494 --> 22:20.028
I'd like to talk terms.

22:27.570 --> 22:30.138
Good. There's no reason we can't
be professional about this.

22:30.206 --> 22:31.306
I agree.

22:31.374 --> 22:33.175
So I'm gonna offer you
one last chance.

22:33.242 --> 22:35.610
If you forfeit your guns,
we'll drop the weapons charges.

22:35.678 --> 22:37.512
If you don't,
a federal prosecutor

22:37.580 --> 22:39.881
is gonna step on your neck
as hard as he can.

22:39.949 --> 22:41.883
Don't embarrass yourself,
Mr. Finley.

22:41.951 --> 22:43.985
We both know you don't have
backup on the way.

22:44.053 --> 22:47.055
Now, that chubby little CPA
in there is gonna die.

22:47.123 --> 22:50.025
If you give him up,
there's no reason <i>you</i> have to.

22:50.092 --> 22:51.927
As I said,
this isn't personal.

22:51.994 --> 22:53.995
Yeah, well, this isn't, either.

22:54.063 --> 22:55.430
Okay, give me a light.

23:03.339 --> 23:04.906
The ammo!
Get down -- now!

23:26.863 --> 23:29.664
Man, I always thought of you as
a second banana, but forget Mike.

23:29.732 --> 23:31.666
You're number one in my book.

23:31.734 --> 23:33.969
- Barry, there were four guys.
- Where's the fourth --

23:34.036 --> 23:35.770
Aah!

23:35.838 --> 23:37.439
And you
made fun of my robot.

23:42.979 --> 23:45.780
Yeah! It hurts, doesn't it?!
Ha!

23:45.848 --> 23:47.616
We got one, man.
One down.

23:47.683 --> 23:48.950
Yeah.

23:49.018 --> 23:51.987
Now there's only three people
trying to kill us.

23:55.645 --> 23:57.947
That was brave,
Mr. Finley.

23:58.014 --> 24:00.182
Brave,
but not very smart.

24:00.250 --> 24:03.352
You just made it my job
to kill you, too.

24:05.055 --> 24:07.356
Well, Mr. Hartley, it's my job
to avoid any further bloodshed,

24:07.424 --> 24:08.691
so I'm warning you --

24:08.758 --> 24:11.860
if you come any closer,
we will open fire.

24:11.928 --> 24:15.564
We are well-armed and prepared
to defend ourselves.

24:15.632 --> 24:18.067
Well,
I'm sorry to disappoint,

24:18.134 --> 24:20.235
but you're
going to have to.

24:23.373 --> 24:25.074
That was good.
Strong.

24:25.141 --> 24:27.242
Yeah, thanks.
I was also lying.

24:29.813 --> 24:30.980
Take a good look.

24:32.248 --> 24:33.482
That's all we've got,
amigo.

24:33.550 --> 24:37.052
What? Why didn't you
bring more ammunition?!

24:37.120 --> 24:39.488
Because we were just here
to pick up a box full of paper!

24:39.556 --> 24:42.024
Why didn't you take the damn
FBI deal when they offered it?!

24:42.092 --> 24:43.625
Well, obviously
I regret that now!

24:45.495 --> 24:47.997
Okay,
I don't hear any sirens,

24:48.064 --> 24:50.132
so he's calling for backup
even as we speak,

24:50.200 --> 24:52.868
so we got to get out of here
before reinforcements show up.

24:52.936 --> 24:55.404
How far away is the garage?
Would you say 60, 70 feet?

24:55.472 --> 24:57.072
I don't know.
I don't live here.

24:57.140 --> 24:58.874
But if we're gonna make
a beeline for it,

24:58.942 --> 25:00.275
we might as well
do it now, right?

25:00.343 --> 25:02.144
Says the one-legged man.

25:02.212 --> 25:04.346
I'm just saying, they got a burning
truck and a man with a hole in his arm.

25:04.414 --> 25:05.781
They seem
pretty well distracted.

25:05.849 --> 25:07.383
Well, distracted
doesn't mean asleep.

25:07.450 --> 25:09.451
You see Sylvester
and Jean-Claude out there?

25:09.519 --> 25:11.553
They're banged up,
but they can still shoot.

25:11.621 --> 25:13.589
If we try and make a run for it
without cover,

25:13.656 --> 25:16.358
we're gonna get
our asses shot off.

25:19.896 --> 25:21.563
What? What?

25:21.631 --> 25:23.399
Hang on!

25:25.802 --> 25:29.271
Come on, bacon, come on.
Give me some bacon. Come on.

25:29.339 --> 25:33.142
Oh!
Yeah.

25:33.209 --> 25:36.578
Um...

25:36.646 --> 25:40.549
Hey, look, I hate to be
a skeptic here, but, uh,

25:40.617 --> 25:43.485
how the hell is breakfast meat
supposed to help us get away?

25:43.553 --> 25:45.654
It's not the meat.
It's the grease.

25:45.722 --> 25:47.856
When I was with the teams,
they taught us

25:47.924 --> 25:50.526
that any hydrocarbon polymer,
like animal fat, can --

25:50.593 --> 25:52.995
never mind.
Breakfast meat is magic.

25:57.100 --> 26:00.069
<i>When you're on the run,</i>
<i>the first few hours</i>

26:00.136 --> 26:02.004
<i>are when you're most likely</i>
<i>to get caught.</i>

26:02.072 --> 26:03.605
<i>Most fugitives</i>
<i>are caught quickly</i>

26:03.673 --> 26:05.507
<i>because they're trying so hard</i>
<i>to get away</i>

26:05.575 --> 26:07.543
<i>that they leave a trail</i>
<i>a mile wide.</i>

26:08.878 --> 26:11.747
<i>The best plan is usually</i>
<i>to hide well</i>

26:11.815 --> 26:13.549
<i>and stay out of sight.</i>

26:15.752 --> 26:17.319
We got something
near the library.

26:17.387 --> 26:20.289
<i>Of course, it doesn't matter</i>
<i>how well you're hidden</i>

26:20.356 --> 26:22.524
<i>if they have a K-9 unit</i>
<i>that can smell you</i>

26:22.592 --> 26:24.893
<i>as well as see you.</i>

26:24.961 --> 26:30.232
<i>In that case, your best option</i>
<i>is usually a decoy.</i>

26:33.470 --> 26:35.637
<i>Give the dog something to find</i>

26:35.705 --> 26:38.874
<i>and hope their handlers</i>
<i>don't look too close.</i>

26:38.942 --> 26:43.245
I'm sorry, ma'am.

26:43.313 --> 26:46.014
It must have been the tobacco
that set him off.

26:46.082 --> 26:47.616
And as exciting as it is

26:47.684 --> 26:49.885
to discover
a hidden pack of ronnies,

26:49.953 --> 26:51.487
I think it's safe to say

26:51.554 --> 26:54.123
that Ms. Glenanne
escaped from your facility.

26:54.190 --> 26:55.591
So go back to your hotel.

26:55.658 --> 26:58.026
You'll be notified
the moment she turns up.

26:58.094 --> 27:00.762
When she turns up,
it'll be in Ireland or Morocco.

27:00.830 --> 27:02.931
My arrangement
with the State Department

27:02.999 --> 27:04.099
was for today.

27:04.167 --> 27:05.634
This trip has been
an utter waste.

27:05.702 --> 27:06.835
Goodbye, Warden.

27:06.903 --> 27:09.404
You will be hearing
from my embassy.

27:12.342 --> 27:15.244
<i>When you're planning</i>
<i>an operation to grab a target,</i>

27:15.311 --> 27:19.648
<i>you want as much manpower</i>
<i>on the ground as you can get.</i>

27:19.716 --> 27:22.351
<i>You want to make sure</i>
<i>you've covered every approach,</i>

27:22.418 --> 27:24.853
<i>every escape route.</i>

27:24.921 --> 27:26.622
Can I have room 104?

27:26.689 --> 27:28.657
<i>Because no matter how much</i>
<i>you plan,</i>

27:28.725 --> 27:30.859
<i>there are always surprises.</i>

27:41.004 --> 27:44.106
All right, new deal.

27:44.174 --> 27:47.142
That's not just any hooker.
She requested room 104.

27:47.210 --> 27:48.544
Anson sent a cutout.

27:48.611 --> 27:51.079
Blonde under the breezeway --
get a mike on her.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.881
I'll do you one better.

27:52.949 --> 27:55.384
This little baby's gonna be
her own private cell tower.

27:55.451 --> 27:58.086
We'll get the location
of whoever she's talking to.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.088
No.
No, there's nobody.

28:00.156 --> 28:02.658
It's a crappy motel.
Jesus, what do you want?

28:02.725 --> 28:04.793
I want you
to keep your eyes open.

28:04.861 --> 28:06.695
Hey, relax.

28:06.763 --> 28:09.131
What the hell's in this package
that's got you so --

28:09.199 --> 28:10.766
I don't pay you
to ask questions.

28:10.833 --> 28:12.434
Just get me the damn bag
by 5:00.

28:12.502 --> 28:13.769
And make sure
no one's watching.

28:13.836 --> 28:14.870
I've got to
get out of town.

28:14.938 --> 28:16.305
We got him.

28:16.372 --> 28:18.440
We got you, you little
vest-wearing son of a bitch!

28:18.508 --> 28:20.075
No, no, no.
We don't have him yet.

28:20.143 --> 28:22.411
Southwest corner of Baltic
and MLK. That's across town.

28:22.478 --> 28:23.779
Drexel Hotel.

28:23.846 --> 28:26.381
Blue team, Anson Fullerton
is at the Drexel Hotel.

28:26.449 --> 28:28.717
We have less than an hour
to get there. Move!

28:35.091 --> 28:36.458
Hey, go easy, Barry.

28:36.526 --> 28:38.894
Hey, if you want me
to run on this leg,

28:38.962 --> 28:41.863
then I need to --
I need to not feel it so much.

28:41.931 --> 28:44.066
Actually, I don't want to feel
much of anything right now.

28:44.133 --> 28:45.867
It looks like
a firing squad out there.

28:45.935 --> 28:47.936
They can't hit
what they can't see.

28:48.004 --> 28:50.138
Trust me.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.607
<i>4,000 years ago,</i>

28:51.674 --> 28:53.475
<i>warriors</i>
<i>disoriented their enemies</i>

28:53.543 --> 28:54.743
<i>by setting fire</i>

28:54.811 --> 28:56.845
<i>to bushels of straw</i>
<i>soaked in grease</i>

28:56.913 --> 28:58.814
<i>and turning them</i>
<i>into smoke bombs.</i>

28:58.881 --> 29:01.016
<i>Even though today's soldiers</i>

29:01.084 --> 29:04.253
<i>have traded burning crops</i>
<i>for hexachloroethane,</i>

29:04.320 --> 29:08.257
<i>it doesn't mean those primitive</i>
<i>methods aren't still effective.</i>

29:10.860 --> 29:12.027
Hey, easy, bub.

29:12.095 --> 29:13.495
Cholesterol kills.

29:13.563 --> 29:16.198
Yeah?
So do trained killers.

29:16.266 --> 29:18.600
I don't know
why they're waiting for backup.

29:18.668 --> 29:20.002
They should just come in here
and kill us now.

29:20.069 --> 29:21.036
Aah!

29:21.104 --> 29:22.204
Well,
don't tell them that.

29:22.272 --> 29:23.605
Okay, now, look.

29:23.673 --> 29:25.507
These are smoke bombs.

29:25.575 --> 29:27.075
It'll give us
some kind of cover.

29:27.143 --> 29:28.910
It's like a curtain between us
and Garret's shooters,

29:28.978 --> 29:30.312
but we're still gonna have to
haul ass.

29:30.380 --> 29:31.446
You ready?

29:31.514 --> 29:33.915
I mean, as ready
as I'll ever be.

29:33.983 --> 29:35.384
Let's just do this.

29:35.451 --> 29:36.985
Okay, whoa.

29:37.053 --> 29:39.221
Now, this entire plan --
our lives --

29:39.289 --> 29:40.822
depends on putting those

29:40.890 --> 29:42.891
directly in front of the guys
with guns.

29:42.959 --> 29:45.794
Now, were you an all-county
quarterback at Annalee High?

29:45.862 --> 29:48.363
I was Nathan Detroit
in "Guys & Dolls."

29:48.431 --> 29:50.365
Yeah.

29:53.102 --> 29:54.403
On my signal,

29:54.470 --> 29:55.904
we're gonna approach the house
from the right.

29:55.972 --> 29:56.672
Get down!

30:00.276 --> 30:01.209
They're not bombs.

30:05.381 --> 30:06.882
Watch out, Barry!

30:11.254 --> 30:12.254
Shoot them!

30:19.429 --> 30:20.162
Whoa!

30:26.836 --> 30:28.804
Aah! I thought you said
there'd be a curtain!

30:28.871 --> 30:30.472
What happened
to the curtain?!

30:30.540 --> 30:33.075
It doesn't matter if the bad guys
are on this side of the curtain!

30:35.211 --> 30:38.347
Garret's reinforcements
showed up!

30:38.414 --> 30:40.115
That's not a jump rope,
is it?

30:40.183 --> 30:41.416
No, that's a detcord.

30:41.484 --> 30:42.984
Garret's gonna make
his own door.

30:43.052 --> 30:44.886
We won't even know
where he's coming from.

30:44.954 --> 30:46.555
That's not good.
Neither is this.

30:48.358 --> 30:49.291
We're out of ammo.

30:55.708 --> 30:57.810
Okay, good.
Another beer.

30:57.877 --> 31:00.179
This means you have a plan,
right? What's this one for?

31:00.246 --> 31:01.780
No, this is just
a regular beer.

31:01.848 --> 31:03.949
Takes the sting off the fact
that I'm gonna die.

31:05.785 --> 31:07.986
I got to say, though, most days
it feels less immediate.

31:17.197 --> 31:18.730
Skirt the edge.
We'll hit him in the back.

31:20.900 --> 31:23.202
Sam, how does
the lord's prayer go?

31:24.437 --> 31:26.371
Come on, you heathen.
I got a plan.

31:26.439 --> 31:28.273
It's just not a plan
I like very much.

31:30.410 --> 31:31.443
Ugh!

31:34.113 --> 31:36.215
This guy pays his gas bill,
right?

31:36.282 --> 31:39.184
Why? What are you --

31:39.252 --> 31:41.854
You <i>are!</i> You're gonna blow up
his house, aren't you?

31:41.921 --> 31:44.289
No. Technically, <i>they're</i> gonna
blow up the house.

31:44.357 --> 31:45.491
I'm just helping them.

31:45.558 --> 31:46.558
Come on. Go.

31:46.626 --> 31:48.060
Ow!

31:48.127 --> 31:52.030
<i>An explosion can kill you</i>
<i>in four different ways.</i>

31:52.098 --> 31:55.834
<i>There's the shock wave,</i>
<i>the shrapnel, the fire,</i>

31:55.902 --> 31:57.669
<i>and the oxygen depletion.</i>

31:57.737 --> 32:00.973
<i>The best way to survive that</i>
<i>deadly combination of factors</i>

32:01.040 --> 32:02.741
<i>is to run like hell.</i>

32:02.809 --> 32:04.610
<i>If running isn't an option,</i>

32:04.677 --> 32:07.346
<i>your best bet is to create</i>
<i>a small, air-tight space</i>

32:07.413 --> 32:10.415
<i>from the most flame-retardant</i>
<i>material you can find.</i>

32:10.483 --> 32:13.652
<i>When an explosion is headed</i>
<i>your way, it's hard to argue</i>

32:13.720 --> 32:17.389
<i>with an overturned</i>
<i>porcelain bathtub.</i>

32:23.463 --> 32:25.030
If we
live through this --

32:25.098 --> 32:27.966
Not a word.
I-I swear. Ever.

32:28.034 --> 32:30.302
<i>The brisancy --</i>
<i>or shattering force --</i>

32:30.370 --> 32:32.738
<i>of a natural-gas explosion</i>

32:32.805 --> 32:36.475
<i>is nowhere near as powerful</i>
<i>as C-4 or RDX.</i>

32:36.543 --> 32:39.077
<i>But just because</i>
<i>the blast won't kill you</i>

32:39.145 --> 32:41.446
<i>doesn't mean</i>
<i>you want to live through it</i>

32:41.514 --> 32:42.681
<i>without proper cover.</i>

32:42.749 --> 32:44.416
Knock, knock, Barry!

33:09.075 --> 33:10.008
Aah!

33:12.011 --> 33:13.612
We made it!

33:13.680 --> 33:14.413
Ohh!

33:14.480 --> 33:16.081
Oh! Get away from me.

33:16.149 --> 33:17.683
You smell like bacon.

33:21.955 --> 33:23.055
Ugh.

33:23.122 --> 33:24.222
Oh, man!

33:24.290 --> 33:25.390
Sorry, Garret.

33:25.458 --> 33:30.228
I guess things
got a little personal.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.602
<i>As a spy, your job</i>
<i>is to avoid detection.</i>

33:36.669 --> 33:39.671
<i>But there</i> are <i>times when you're</i>
<i>sure to be discovered,</i>

33:39.739 --> 33:41.440
<i>and all that's left</i>
<i>is how and when.</i>

33:41.507 --> 33:43.141
<i>But that's not nothing.</i>

33:43.209 --> 33:44.843
<i>Sometimes how and when</i>

33:44.911 --> 33:47.446
<i>give your friends</i>
<i>an awful lot of leverage.</i>

33:47.513 --> 33:48.714
This one says she heard

33:48.781 --> 33:50.415
two inmates in "F" block
planning something.

33:50.483 --> 33:51.717
Go ahead. Tell her.

33:51.784 --> 33:53.518
You didn't say "please,"
Glen.

33:53.586 --> 33:56.488
As in please clear this room
so the grown-ups can talk.

33:56.556 --> 33:59.024
And please have
a sparkling water waiting for me

33:59.092 --> 33:59.791
when I'm done.

34:01.728 --> 34:03.261
What do you want,
Ms. Reeds?

34:03.329 --> 34:04.930
I don't have
much time today.

34:04.998 --> 34:07.766
Oh? Really?
Well, I've got a lot of time.

34:07.834 --> 34:11.168
In fact, that's what
I want to talk to you about.

34:11.237 --> 34:13.672
I'm up for parole
in three months.

34:13.739 --> 34:16.141
You're up for <i>rejection</i>
<i>in three months.</i>

34:16.208 --> 34:17.842
Well, no.
Not this time.

34:17.909 --> 34:24.216
This time, I'll have
a letter of support from you.

34:24.283 --> 34:25.751
Why?

34:25.818 --> 34:28.453
Because you ratted out two
chickenheads planning a riot?

34:28.521 --> 34:30.755
Because I know
where Fiona Glenanne is.

34:30.822 --> 34:35.060
And soon as that's signed
and faxed to my lawyer,

34:35.128 --> 34:36.360
you will, too.

34:43.603 --> 34:47.739
Get out of there!
Come here!

34:47.806 --> 34:50.708
Aah!

34:50.777 --> 34:52.911
I bet you think
you're awfully clever.

34:52.978 --> 34:55.313
But your British friend
is just going to fly back

34:55.380 --> 34:56.782
and make another appointment.

34:56.849 --> 34:58.216
Well, he better hurry.

34:58.284 --> 35:00.952
Ayn's not the only one
expecting an early release.

35:05.091 --> 35:06.758
Put them both in solitary.

35:15.268 --> 35:16.468
Going left.

35:18.905 --> 35:20.872
Okay.
Up ahead, around the corner.

35:26.446 --> 35:28.213
Safety your weapons,
but be prepared.

35:28.281 --> 35:30.248
I want Anson alive,
not in a body bag.

35:33.853 --> 35:35.454
Right there.

35:54.974 --> 35:56.975
Damn it!
He was forwarding the calls!

35:57.043 --> 35:58.543
Low-tech, less traceable.

35:58.611 --> 36:00.545
Pretty smart way
to bounce a call, actually.

36:00.613 --> 36:01.913
Let's get tech in here.
Maybe we can --

36:01.981 --> 36:03.315
No. We call him back.

36:03.382 --> 36:05.183
We'll get a hit off his location
before he picks up,

36:05.251 --> 36:06.952
make it look like his cutout
pocket-dialed him.

36:07.019 --> 36:08.386
Mike, that's too risky.
He might rea--

36:08.454 --> 36:10.255
He said he had to leave
by 5:00.

36:10.323 --> 36:13.191
There's no way we'll have time
to get Langley involved.

36:19.198 --> 36:20.866
We got it. We got it.
He's near the airport.

36:20.933 --> 36:22.100
All right,
that's 20 minutes.

36:22.168 --> 36:23.735
The son of a bitch
is getting away again.

36:23.803 --> 36:25.137
There's no way we get there
in time.

36:25.204 --> 36:28.740
Maybe we don't have to.

36:39.552 --> 36:40.619
What?

36:40.686 --> 36:42.354
Nate,
are you near the airport?

36:42.421 --> 36:44.923
Yeah. How the hell you think
I'm gonna get home, jackass?

36:44.991 --> 36:46.424
Anson is not here.

36:46.492 --> 36:49.027
He's at a café
called Tides Café.

36:49.095 --> 36:50.228
Now,
he won't be there for long.

36:50.296 --> 36:51.329
So now you need me,
huh?

36:51.397 --> 36:52.964
Nate,
I will apologize later.

36:53.032 --> 36:55.534
But right now, I'm just trying
to get over there.

36:55.601 --> 36:57.369
He's probably
going to be armed,

36:57.436 --> 36:59.204
so I want you
to get eyes on him,

36:59.272 --> 37:00.705
but do not approach him.

37:00.773 --> 37:03.708
Do you understand me?
Do not approach him.

37:03.776 --> 37:06.111
Mike, I got this.

37:18.991 --> 37:20.125
Listen to me.

37:20.193 --> 37:22.928
You can have the cash
if you burn the I.D.s.

37:22.995 --> 37:25.530
Because something
doesn't smell right --

37:25.598 --> 37:26.898
Ohh!

37:31.404 --> 37:34.940
Hey, asshole,
Michael Westen says hello.

37:35.007 --> 37:35.841
Get up.

37:35.908 --> 37:38.410
Get up!

37:46.226 --> 37:47.688
Enjoy the moment, Fredo,

37:47.689 --> 37:49.891
but I know where too many bodies
are buried.

37:49.958 --> 37:51.092
I'll be out in a week.

37:51.159 --> 37:52.293
Shut up.

37:52.361 --> 37:53.828
Shut your mouth.
I don't want to hear it.

37:55.797 --> 37:56.931
I'll call Fi's lawyer,

37:56.999 --> 37:58.532
tell her she can start
the paperwork.

38:01.637 --> 38:03.838
Mike, we got him, man.

38:03.906 --> 38:05.740
It is about time.

38:34.303 --> 38:35.903
Nate!

38:37.839 --> 38:38.739
You're gonna be
all right.

38:38.807 --> 38:40.174
Okay?

38:40.242 --> 38:42.877
Look at me. You're okay.
You're okay.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.945
I'm gonna get you help,
all right?

38:49.217 --> 38:52.320
I'm scared.

38:52.387 --> 38:54.155
Come on.
No, no, no. Come on.

38:54.222 --> 38:57.725
No, no, no.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.026
No.

38:59.094 --> 39:00.394
No!

39:00.462 --> 39:01.429
Hey!

39:01.496 --> 39:02.396
Hey, Nate!

39:21.583 --> 39:23.317
South side's clear!
There's nothing over here!

39:51.713 --> 39:54.181
<i>A spy's life</i>
<i>is spent preparing --</i>

39:54.249 --> 39:56.851
<i>learning languages,</i>
<i>researching targets,</i>

39:56.918 --> 39:58.719
<i>practicing with weapons.</i>

39:58.787 --> 40:01.956
<i>You prepare so when</i>
<i>the important moments arrive,</i>

40:02.024 --> 40:03.224
<i>you're ready.</i>

40:03.291 --> 40:05.393

<i>human moments --</i>

40:06.995 --> 40:10.297
<i>that no amount of training</i>

40:12.968 --> 40:13.868
Hi, honey.

40:13.935 --> 40:15.703
How'd it go?

40:19.641 --> 40:20.741
Mom.

40:20.809 --> 40:22.309
Michael,
what's the matter?

40:25.547 --> 40:26.514
Nate's gone.

40:29.418 --> 40:30.651
Mom, Nate's dead.

40:34.556 --> 40:35.823
No,
he -- no, he isn't!

41:54.669 --> 41:55.903
It took you long enough.

41:55.971 --> 41:58.038
I was beginning to think
you didn't need me.

42:03.145 --> 42:04.979
Fi,
I need you more than ever.

42:08.550 --> 42:10.017
