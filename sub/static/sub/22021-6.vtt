WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.450
Previously on "Designated Survivor”...

00:02.586 --> 00:04.452
Have you made a decision
about a lawyer for your mother?

00:04.588 --> 00:07.421
-You know my recommendation.
-Kendra Daynes.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.756
Present company excluded,
she's the best lawyer I know.

00:09.885 --> 00:12.968
[Alex] My mother's subpoena
is prosecutorial bad faith.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.554
And this attempt to tie her
into Eric Little's recent death...

00:15.682 --> 00:17.013
| mean, it's ridiculous.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.473
[Emily] Charlotte Thorn was
the British rep.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.468
-They were touting her as a future P.M.
-[gunshot]

00:20.604 --> 00:22.220
[Damian] Ms. Lane, you were her aide.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.438
Is there anyone in particular
she crossed swords with?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.682
Darius Cray.
A British importer-exporter.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.354
Well, that's a cover for arms dealing.

00:28.487 --> 00:32.025
We need to ask you a few
questions about Charlotte Thorn, Mr. Cray.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.443
| never met Charlotte Thorn.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.947
-[gunshot]
-[man grunts]

00:37.829 --> 00:39.206
[Hannah] It's Darius Cray.

00:39.331 --> 00:42.323
[Chuck] There was activity in one
of Cray's accounts after he was shot.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.245
A transfer of 100 million euros.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.336
And the only person with access
to that account was Catherine, his wife.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.171
You saying we've been
chasing the wrong Cray?

00:49.299 --> 00:51.381
Yeah, Catherine's been calling the shots.
He was just a front.

00:51.510 --> 00:52.716
| know you've had my back.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.710
-Thanks.
-You, too.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.053
I'm kind of picky about who I work with.

01:00.060 --> 01:04.974
[thunder rumbling,
waves crashing]

01:08.235 --> 01:10.192
[radio chatter]

01:13.574 --> 01:16.362
Latest from NWS, sir.
We're in the soup a few more hours.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.407
Lemmy, what's our range?

01:20.622 --> 01:23.705
Minimal. Radar's gonna be spotty
until we clear the electrical storm.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.622
All right, I'll see about upping
our low-vis detail. Chris?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.541
[explosion]

01:29.673 --> 01:32.085
-[hull creaks]
-[alarm blares]

01:32.217 --> 01:34.208
[indistinct shouting]

01:36.680 --> 01:39.047
[alarm blares]

01:41.852 --> 01:44.970
[Aaron] The U.S.S. Verona,
an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer,

01:45.105 --> 01:48.518
collided with a sanitation barge
off the coast of Kunami.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.732
What was one of our warships
doing in enemy waters?

01:50.861 --> 01:54.274
It was en route to Bahrain for
joint military exercises with the CMF.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.773
A storm disabled
its radar and nav systems.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.114
She drifted off course.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.699
So, let me get this straight.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.286
A $6 billion warship's response
to inclement weather

02:02.414 --> 02:04.781
is to run into a floating garbage truck?

02:04.916 --> 02:05.997
You know what I think?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.288
Yeah. That for $6 billion,
the thing should be able to levitate.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.036
Damn right.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.541
[woman] Attention!

02:11.673 --> 02:13.255
Anything from the Kunami Ambassador?

02:13.383 --> 02:14.919
[Emily] He put out a statement accusing us

02:15.052 --> 02:16.838
of a hostile incursion
into their territorial waters.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.758
For what, running into
a hundred-thousand tons of their trash?

02:19.890 --> 02:23.053
He says that was divine providence.
He's consulting with the emir.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.927
-Casualties?
-[Chernow] 16 dead. Dozens injured, sir.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.430
Well, the Verona's incapacitated.
We'll have to tow her out.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.351
But we will need Kunami's cooperation.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.646
Well, we may need a show of force
to get that.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.360
We're talking about a renegade regime

02:34.488 --> 02:37.446
that's been under military and economic
sanctions for over a decade.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.780
Where's our closest fleet?

02:38.909 --> 02:40.946
[Chernow] Well, the best case,
the Fifth is eight hours out.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.445
Kunami, we can handle,
but they're not the only problem, sir.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.288
Right. Other hostile nations
in the Middle East are watching.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.078
Son of a bitch.
This can go global quickly.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.873
The problem is, the Verona
is loaded with technology

02:52.005 --> 02:53.746
we have to keep
out of Kunami's hands.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.384
First and foremost,
we've got 300 Americans

02:55.509 --> 02:58.297
stranded in hostile waters, many of them
injured. We need to bring them home.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.295
Admiral, deploy the Fifth. I want to talk
to the captain of the Verona.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.637
Well, there is no captain, sir.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.804
The senior command
was meeting in his quarters,

03:05.936 --> 03:08.098
and then swept out to sea
when the hull was breached.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.766
My God.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.524
Get me the senior officer in charge.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.235
Tell the press pool that the President
regrets the loss of life,

03:17.364 --> 03:20.072
and we're reaching out to Kunami to
secure the immediate rescue of her crew.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.862
Okay. They're still gonna want to know
what a U.S. destroyer was doing

03:22.994 --> 03:24.951
-in Kunami waters.
-Well, there's a phenomenon called rain,

03:25.080 --> 03:27.822
sometimes accompanied by
an atmospheric disturbance called wind.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.824
You really want me to feed that
to the hyenas?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.167
No. Tell them that the President
regrets the loss of life.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.252
-You said that.
-Well, the regret is profound.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.793
-And we're reaching out to Kunami to se--
-You said that, too.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.838
-My lack of sleep is profound.
-Try coffee.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.132
-I don't drink coffee anymore.
-Start.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.471
[woman] The President's online, sir.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.223
Mr. President.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.275
At ease, sailor.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.357
What's your name?

03:55.485 --> 03:56.646
Lieutenant Will Griffin, sir.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.109
How's the ship doing?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.730
The damage is pretty
significant, Mr. President.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.857
-Can she move at all?
-No, sir. Negative.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.234
Engines are down. Right now,
it's about waiting for help

04:05.370 --> 04:06.781
and taking care of our wounded.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.158
We lost a lot of good people, sir.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.247
| know.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.457
Lucky for us, we still have one in charge.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.998
-Sir?
- I was reading your file.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.791
Third in your class at Annapolis,

04:16.923 --> 04:19.130
Navy Commendation Medals,
three Navy Achievement Medals,

04:19.259 --> 04:20.714
and a NATO Medal.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.336
-Impressive, Captain.
-It's Lieutenant, sir.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.884
If I'm gonna ask you to lead
your crew out of there,

04:26.016 --> 04:28.633
-you're gonna do it with the proper rank.
-Sir, I... I don't know.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.262
...I only was commissioned three years
ago. Commanding a ship, I don't...

04:32.397 --> 04:34.809
| wasn't ready
for my battlefield promotion either.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.854
Circumstances make the man.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.187
I'll let you in on a secret.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.068
I'm a design nerd.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.611
I know all about your vessel.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.235
-You sail, sir?
-It's not the water that I love.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.748
It's the ships. And yours is a beauty.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.409
Double-spaced steel armor,

04:51.541 --> 04:52.497
Kevlar spall liners,

04:52.626 --> 04:54.242
displaces 8,300 tons.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.335
Next generation's gonna be
made out of carbon nanotubes.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.917
The future.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.758
Led there by men like you.
Take care of your crew, Captain.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.047
We're coming to get you.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.419
Yes, sir.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.932
Verona out.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.391
| wish I could be of more help
with Kunami, Mr. President.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.635
The sanctions you imposed
when you were President

05:12.771 --> 05:14.887
make you persona non grata
in that kingdom.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.310
So unfortunately, right now,
the best thing you can do for us

05:17.442 --> 05:19.399
-is to sit this one out.
-Understood.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.895
But if I can be of help
behind the scenes,

05:22.030 --> 05:23.236
I'm here.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.322
Thank you. I appreciate it.

05:26.076 --> 05:29.569
Oh, and there is another area
where I think I might be of help.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.821
The Thorn murder...

05:31.957 --> 05:34.369
Our reputation's been taking
a beating abroad over it.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.493
| know it, and rightfully so.
The Prime Minister's furious.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.290
Well, I have deep ties with her.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.333
Perhaps I could smooth things.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.672
That would be great.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.792
I'll have Aaron fold you
into the investigation.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.589
-Thank you, Cornelius.
-Thank you, sir.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.462
We've looked into Catherine Cray.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.215
Every meeting her husband has had
in the last five years,

05:51.351 --> 05:52.591
she's been in the same city.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.764
Every account he has,
she's a co-signatory.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.102
He's her flunky.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.723
-Have you spoken to her?
-We've tried.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.146
She's lawyered up and walled off
in her hotel suite

06:01.278 --> 06:03.019
while Darius recovers and awaits a trial.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.656
So I'm to tell the Prime Minister

06:04.781 --> 06:06.772
that the chief suspect
in the murder of my boss -

06:06.908 --> 06:09.570
one of her most trusted allies -
is thumbing her nose at U.S. justice.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.819
We would prefer you tell her
that we're flushing her out.

06:11.955 --> 06:12.786
How?

06:12.914 --> 06:14.780
She's got over 100 million
stashed in U.S. accounts.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.907
Secretary Moss is looking
to freeze her assets.

06:17.043 --> 06:20.377
We're hoping she reaches out once
she realizes she can't write a check.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.121
Please keep me posted.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.918
[Damian] Of course, Ms. Lane.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.926
-We gonna talk about this?
-Talk about what?

06:31.766 --> 06:34.144
About, well, what happened between us...

06:34.269 --> 06:36.180
Nothing happened between us.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.813
Well, nothing that should make us feel
uncomfortable around each other.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.603
-You know what makes me uncomfortable?
-What?

06:42.944 --> 06:44.526
Talking about it.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.320
-In exchange for what?
-Mr. Ambassador--

06:50.452 --> 06:53.865
[scoffs] You want to violate
our sovereign waters again.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.954
In exchange for what?

06:56.082 --> 06:57.993
The thanks of our grateful nation.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.709
-So, the sanctions, the resolutions--
-Are for a later discussion.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.794
This is a humanitarian rescue mission.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.459
Yes, I'm certain a U.S. destroyer

07:04.591 --> 07:07.128
finds itself in our waters
for humanitarian reasons.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.001
How it got there is irrelevant.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.219
| will tell you what is relevant,
Mr. Shore.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.589
We would not even be
having this conversation

07:13.725 --> 07:17.639
if a Kunami warship were stranded
10 miles off the coast of New York City.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.057
-Do you know why?
-Mr. Ambassador--

07:19.189 --> 07:22.147
Because your navy would have sent it
to the bottom of the Atlantic.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.484
I'm obligated to inform you,
a refusal to let us rescue our men

07:25.612 --> 07:27.148
will be deemed a hostile act.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.193
I'm obligated to inform you
that the emir is not prepared

07:30.325 --> 07:32.362
to let a second U.S. ship

07:32.494 --> 07:35.862
infringe upon the sanctity
of our territorial waters.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.457
-Mr. President.
-Admiral, what's the update?

07:40.585 --> 07:42.997
That's Kunami's fleet;
five ships and counting.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.872
-Tell me about the formation.
-It's a classic blockade.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.670
Our ships won't be able to get anywhere
near the Verona without running it.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.635
-And risking a war.
-[Aaron] It doesn't make sense

07:51.763 --> 07:55.301
-that the emirate would want to do that.
-What they want is to make us sweat.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.094
Our ship is at the mercy of a regime

07:57.227 --> 07:59.685
that is desperate to prove
its own legitimacy to its people.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.850
And we have a crew
that expects us to rescue them,

08:01.982 --> 08:04.019
when apparently
there's no easy way to do that.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.403
Admiral, contact Captain Griffin.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.439
We need to let him know
that we haven't abandoned him.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.824
[theme music]

08:21.584 --> 08:24.497
Radar's got their ships, sir,
three clicks off our starboard bow.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.836
They're just saber-rattling, son.
They're not gonna fire on you.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.423
Well, we can defend ourselves.
We got Tomahawks, harpoons...

08:29.551 --> 08:31.337
What about food?

08:31.469 --> 08:34.211
Uh, refrigeration's out, galley's flooded.
Mostly canned goods are left.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.432
Unfortunately, I've had the displeasure
of eating military rations.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.768
Do yourself a favor.
Toss the food. Eat the cans.

08:41.895 --> 08:43.727
You really are a navy buff, sir.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.474
I'm gonna need you to address your crew.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.228
We're taking the diplomatic route.
It's gonna take some time.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.820
I need you to assure them

08:52.949 --> 08:55.361
they're gonna be eating
a hot meal on land soon enough.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.779
Aye, aye, sir.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.527
-Verona out.
-[exhales sharply]

08:58.663 --> 09:01.041
Kunami's just officially
cut all diplomatic ties.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.203
They're posturing, sir.
Time is on their side.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.620
Because the casualties are on ours.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.745
If they catch us blinking first,
they'll have us over a barrel.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.997
Oh, no. I wouldn't count on them
blinking at all, sir.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.921
-Why not?
-Because Kunami's an unstable regime.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.339
If the emir lets an American fleet

09:14.471 --> 09:16.337
tow the Verona out
while he sits on his hands,

09:16.473 --> 09:18.760
he may as well send out
invitations to his own coup.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.179
Then we're gonna have to find
a concession we can live with.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.973
I'll have Secretary Moss ask Cairo
to open a back channel with the emir,

09:24.105 --> 09:25.186
find out he really wants.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.181
Mr. President,
Kendra Daynes needs to see you.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.103
Okay. Go ahead. I'll catch up.

09:30.361 --> 09:32.102
Kendra, come with me.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.322
| had my off-the-record
with Director Foerstel today.

09:35.450 --> 09:38.317
Did you ask him about the status of
the investigation into my mother-in-law?

09:38.453 --> 09:40.740
Yes, sir. He stressed the importance
of an independent FBI,

09:40.872 --> 09:42.112
then showed me the door.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.989
Did he tell you it was inappropriate

09:44.125 --> 09:45.866
to have a discussion
about an ongoing investigation?

09:46.002 --> 09:47.618
No, sir. He refused
to address the subject.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.997
Trust me, he addressed it. Now we know
it's an ongoing investigation.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.372
Yes, sir, he's still digging,

09:52.509 --> 09:54.921
even though we managed to quash
your mother-in-law's subpoena.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.543
In all fairness, he doesn't really
have a choice.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.589
Sir?

09:57.722 --> 10:00.589
After the bombing, there was a vacancy
at the head of the FBI.

10:00.725 --> 10:04.093
Foerstel was the obvious choice;
impeccable record, impeccable integrity.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.096
So in order to be seen as impartial,
he has to pursue this.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.563
To the ends of the Earth.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.023
Sir, I may be able to help here
if you give me some latitude.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.017
What do you need?

10:12.153 --> 10:13.894
Unfettered access
to your mother-in-law.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.818
Eva didn't sign up for any of this.
She won't handle it well.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.816
-I'm not comfortable with that.
-I understand.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.035
But the longer this drags on,
the more involved she's going to become.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.376
[sighs]

10:29.462 --> 10:30.964
You're right.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.670
You're right.

10:32.799 --> 10:33.960
[phone beeps]

10:35.552 --> 10:37.338
Can you patch me through
to Eva Booker, please?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.131
Hey, Seth.
How'd your press conference go?

10:39.264 --> 10:41.426
Um, Al-Jazeera asked me
what a U.S. destroyer

10:41.558 --> 10:43.640
-was doing in Kunami waters.
-And what did you say?

10:43.768 --> 10:45.270
| said, trying to get
its engines started.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.557
[chuckles]
How very literal of you.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.647
Oh, I dropped off the Charlotte Thorn
presser notes on your desk.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.061
You dropped those off last night.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.651
Really?
Oh. Well, now you have two copies.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.440
-You want to tell me what's going on?
-[sighs]

10:56.573 --> 10:58.655
'Cause I find the whole absent-minded
professor thing charming,

10:58.783 --> 11:00.399
but the big guy won't.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.409
[sighs]

11:03.538 --> 11:05.905
I'm supposed to have lunch
with my dad.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.906
Okay. You've never mentioned him.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.535
That's because I haven't seen him in
23 years. Not since he walked out on us.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.787
-Sorry. I didn't know.
-He got in touch a few weeks ago.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.664
He's in town all week
for some convention,

11:15.800 --> 11:17.211
and I've been putting him off.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.300
-But he leaves tonight.
-So, what are you gonna do?

11:19.429 --> 11:23.093
Well, part of me would like to see him
so I can plunge a knife into his heart.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.806
Yeah, maybe not that.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.971
But the other part thinks
that if I let him go,

11:27.103 --> 11:29.060
then I'll be closing
a door on him forever.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.100
-But the choice is out of my hands.
-Why?

11:31.232 --> 11:33.473
Because 300 of our sailors
are trapped in enemy waters,

11:33.610 --> 11:35.567
Charlotte Thorn's killer
is still on the loose,

11:35.695 --> 11:38.733
and the world is, you know, on fire.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.105
The world is always on fire.

11:40.241 --> 11:43.779
Em, I would never tell you what to do,
but don't let this place be an excuse.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.279
The flames will still be here
when you get back.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.834
[sighs]

11:53.755 --> 11:56.338
[Daniel] I moved to Key West
for a few years.

11:56.466 --> 11:57.831
| had a limo business.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.584
| figured, you know, people in paradise,

12:00.720 --> 12:02.927
they would be too drunk to drive.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.265
Turns out they were all just too drunk
to make a phone call.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.646
| don't remember
you being this quiet, Emily.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.857
Didn't want to interrupt you
while you were telling your life story.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.394
It's missing one thing, though.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.490
Me.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.533
Emily, I am so sorry.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.199
| don't need your apology.
My mother does.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.163
-It's not what you think.
-Really?

12:30.291 --> 12:35.081
Because I think you were too busy skiing
and getting a tan to be a dad.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.673
| left because your mother and |
weren't in love.

12:40.385 --> 12:44.094
So that's why I never heard from you;
because you didn't love my mother.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.966
[-I-I'm not here to make excuses.

12:46.099 --> 12:51.310
All I can tell you is that I knew
if your mother wasn't in my life,

12:51.437 --> 12:53.724
then I couldn't be in yours.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.109
You're right. That's...
that's not an excuse. That's worse.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.192
-That is cowardly and pathetic.
-Emily...

12:59.320 --> 13:02.733
Do you know what it's like
to be a little girl with a birthday?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.824
And you run home from school

13:05.952 --> 13:09.695
praying that this is the year
your dad sends you a card.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.039
[voice breaking]
And you get home,

13:13.167 --> 13:15.909
and you check the mail, and no.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.078
It's not the year.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.711
And there never was a year.

13:24.137 --> 13:28.131
Emily, I wanted to reach out to you
a thousand times.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.182
But I didn't know what to say.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.725
[sighs]
How about goodbye?

13:47.452 --> 13:48.783
[sighs]

13:49.746 --> 13:52.579
| carried this around for 20 years,

13:53.291 --> 13:54.781
about a little girl from Akron

13:54.917 --> 13:58.581
who won a really big spelling bee.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.583
| kept it because of the picture. But...

14:03.384 --> 14:05.466
Well, now that
I've finally seen you again...

14:08.264 --> 14:10.596
...I don't need it anymore.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.850
[sighs]

14:14.979 --> 14:16.185
Dad, wait.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.856
[Oliver] You've charged my client's
husband with arms trafficking.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.486
You've charged her with nothing.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.854
So it's ironic she should wake up
and find her accounts blocked.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.980
I'm glad we finally have her attention.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.236
And now I have yours.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.531
A motion to unfreeze my client's assets.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.869
| filed it this morning in federal court.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.581
A suit for malicious prosecution.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.246
I'm gonna fill out the statement of facts
after this meeting.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.666
Mrs. Cray hasn't been prosecuted yet.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.664
No. She's just being harassed.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.461
Ma'am, how 'bout you just
answer some questions,

14:45.593 --> 14:47.300
and then you can save
on some legal fees.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.089
How 'bout you and Mr. Bean here
stop wasting--

14:49.222 --> 14:52.715
It's okay, Oliver.
We can end this nonsense now.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.591
| had nothing to do
with my husband's business.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.685
The fact of all your accounts being
joint ones tells a different story.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.021
Yes, of my naivety.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.852
| design pocketbooks.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.692
My only mistake
was co-mingling our funds.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.311
[Oliver] And that is not a crime.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.108
No, just evidence of one.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.527
It's a witch hunt by a government

15:09.659 --> 15:13.948
looking to deflect attention from the fact
that it can't solve a high-profile murder.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.788
A murder that
| had nothing to do with.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.499
-I'm not a criminal, Agent Wells.
-Your husband is.

15:19.627 --> 15:23.586
And the minute he stands trial,
he's going to realize that his best play

15:23.714 --> 15:26.046
is to implicate you
in the murder of Charlotte Thorn.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.629
[knocking at door]

15:28.761 --> 15:30.297
[door opens]

15:33.266 --> 15:35.633
The FBI just got this demand video,

15:35.768 --> 15:38.760
routed through proxy servers,
so we don't know who sent it.

15:38.896 --> 15:39.806
[tablet beeps]

15:39.939 --> 15:41.395
[voice breaking]
I'm Charlotte Thorn's aide.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.014
My name is Peyton Lane.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.859
| have been instructed
by my captors

15:45.987 --> 15:47.443
that the American government

15:47.572 --> 15:50.189
Is to extradite Darius Cray
to Malaysia.

15:50.324 --> 15:53.316
[crying] If he is not extradited
by 4:00 P.M. today,

15:53.453 --> 15:54.943
| will be killed.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.454
Please, do as they say!

15:58.332 --> 16:01.165
Looks like we've got you
on kidnapping now, too.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.958
-Excuse me?
-We just saw your ransom video.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.830
-What are you talking about?
-[Hannah] Peyton Lane -

16:06.966 --> 16:09.378
the person you're using
to leverage your husband's release.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.888
-You know it's not gonna happen, right?
-What's going on, Oliver?

16:12.013 --> 16:14.675
[Oliver] I'll tell you, Catherine.
We've come here voluntarily,

16:14.807 --> 16:17.845
in the process of which,
our friends have seen fit

16:17.977 --> 16:21.595
to accuse you of kidnapping,
extortion, and murder.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.940
- Don't know what to say.
- I do. Thank you

16:25.067 --> 16:27.479
for helping us
fill out the statement of facts.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.398
-I need you right now.
-[Seth] I have a presser.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.195
-Then you haven't seen it?
-Seen what?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.990
You want to get ambushed in there,
or you want to come with me?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.533
Presser's canceled.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.201
[Ambassador Darzi]
The U.S.S. Verona,

16:41.334 --> 16:43.245
which has been crippled
by an act of God,

16:43.377 --> 16:45.914
was in fact sent by America

16:46.047 --> 16:47.958
<i>to spy on our peace-loving nation.</i>

16:48.090 --> 16:50.502
As an instrument of such treachery,

16:50.635 --> 16:52.922
it is now the property
of the Kunami people.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.803
-I guess we know what Kunami wants.
-Yes.

16:57.225 --> 16:58.761
Our ship.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.391
Admiral, I need you to tell me.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.481
Was the Verona engaged in espionage?

17:06.608 --> 17:08.020
In addition to its advanced weaponry,

17:08.152 --> 17:11.109
the Verona has a state-of-the-art
surveillance system, sir.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.319
What were we monitoring?

17:12.448 --> 17:14.233
Kunami's compliance
with the sanctions.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.233
Admiral, is there anything on the Verona

17:16.368 --> 17:17.905
that would confirm
the emirate's allegations?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.448
Unfortunately, sir, there is.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.492
The ship's Voyage Data Recorder
tracks its movements to the second.

17:22.625 --> 17:23.786
Now, if the emirate coordinates

17:23.917 --> 17:25.500
the Verona's geo-locations
with the weather,

17:25.627 --> 17:29.212
they can prove we were in their waters
before the monsoon hit.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.547
And our plausible deniability
goes out the window.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.418
Who on board the ship would have known
about the surveillance activities?

17:34.554 --> 17:38.013
The captain, the X-O,
the operations officer.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.346
But not a junior lieutenant?

17:39.475 --> 17:40.431
Oh, no, sir.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.142
The Saudi Ambassador says

17:42.270 --> 17:44.932
Kunami's willing to allow
the rescue of the Verona crew

17:45.064 --> 17:48.682
in exchange with the lifting of
the prohibition on its uranium program.

17:48.818 --> 17:49.979
[sighs]

17:50.820 --> 17:52.936
Well, now we know
what they're willing to trade for.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.278
Our ship for a potential weapons program.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.276
Not acceptable.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.661
[Griffin] The Voyage Data Recorder?

18:01.789 --> 18:03.200
[Tom] Yes, Captain.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.285
Can I ask why it's so important, sir?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.375
I'm afraid not,
but we need you to destroy it.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.914
That's gonna be difficult, sir.

18:09.046 --> 18:12.505
The VDR is located in the Combat
Information Center, which is underwater.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.089
Come again, Captain?

18:14.218 --> 18:15.925
The hull was more compromised
than we thought.

18:16.053 --> 18:19.717
We sprung a leak on the starboard side.
The bilge pumps are working fine,

18:19.849 --> 18:23.012
but I had to seal off a couple
of compartments to reduce the stress.

18:23.144 --> 18:26.057
Good work.
Is there any way to access the CIC?

18:26.188 --> 18:27.394
Not without a diver, sir.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.105
Is that something
you would feel comfortable

18:29.233 --> 18:32.021
-asking one of your men to do?
-No, sir. Too dangerous.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.776
I'll do it myself.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.315
Right answer, but we can't risk it.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.405
-Mr. President--
-Stand pat, Captain.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.825
That's an order.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.489
Yes, sir.

18:42.913 --> 18:43.744
Verona out.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.534
Admiral, honestly,
how far out is the Fifth Fleet?

18:45.666 --> 18:46.781
[Chernow] Three hours.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.783
The choppy waters
are slowing the fleet down.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.172
We can have a strike package
there in minutes.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.753
[Emily] Sir, there's an optics difference

18:52.882 --> 18:55.123
between using force to rescue a ship
on a peaceable mission

18:55.259 --> 18:56.465
and one that was spying.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.006
Right now, I don't care about the optics.
| care about the crew.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.549
Well, sir, I have to advise you

19:00.681 --> 19:03.139
if we start launching missiles at their
ships, the Verona's a sitting duck.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.348
And the clock is ticking.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.059
We don't want force
to be our primary option.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.144
We need to keep moving
on the diplomatic front.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.229
[sighs] You're right.

19:10.358 --> 19:13.100
| want both of you to reach out
to the Foreign Relations Committee.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.612
See how much room
we've got to maneuver.

19:14.737 --> 19:15.977
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.572
Get me Senators Cowling
and Damone here yesterday.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.698
-Okay, but...
-And I want an update from Secretary Moss

19:28.834 --> 19:30.086
-on the Thorn investigation.
-Emily...

19:30.211 --> 19:31.167
Can I get some lunch?

19:31.295 --> 19:32.956
| didn't eat because...
Oh, my God, my dad!

19:33.089 --> 19:35.330
That's what I wanted to tell you.
He's wandering the West Wing.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.332
| was giving him a tour,
and I got waylaid.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.176
Just stash him in my office,
and I'll get back as soon as I can.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.089
Okay.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.587
| know I wasn't
supposed to bring him here,

19:42.723 --> 19:44.589
-but he really wanted to see...
-Emily, he's lovely.

19:44.725 --> 19:45.965
-Yeah?
-Yes.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.594
He fixed Elinor's chair and made
egg creams for half the floor.

19:48.729 --> 19:49.844
Go be you.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.232
-He won't wreck the place.
-Thank you.

19:51.357 --> 19:52.597
[Moss] Let me get this straight.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.566
Not only have we not arrested
those responsible for Thorn's murder,

19:55.695 --> 19:58.312
but now you're telling me
that her aide has been kidnapped.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.905
We have Forensics examining
the video for clues, sir.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.741
Well, I can tell you what
they're going to find. Nothing.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.069
Because these people are
two steps ahead of us.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.536
One person, sir.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.874
We believe Catherine Cray
is responsible for everything:

20:11.001 --> 20:13.618
the arms smuggling, the murder
of Charlotte Thorn, the kidnapping.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.246
And if we don't extradite
Cray's husband to Malaysia,

20:16.382 --> 20:17.668
Peyton Lane is dead.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.633
-Malaysia's out of the question.
-They have jurisdiction, sir.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.594
The weapons on board Darius Cray's ship
were earmarked for Malaysia.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.091
Yes, but there's a reason why Catherine
wants her husband tried there.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.842
The Crays have big holdings
in East Asia.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.390
Meaning Darius is looking
at a slap on the wrist.

20:31.522 --> 20:35.015
House arrest, one year tops,
if I had to guess,

20:35.151 --> 20:37.813
instead of the 50 he'd get stateside
for arms trafficking.

20:37.945 --> 20:41.859
No, I'm afraid that extradition is
out of the question for this President.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.652
So we need to find Peyton Lane.

20:43.784 --> 20:48.244
Before the press gets wind of the
kidnapping, and before Cray kills her.

20:48.372 --> 20:52.240
-Yes, sir.
-[phone ringing]

20:53.836 --> 20:55.952
Madame Prime Minister.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.580
Ma'am, I'm afraid
| have some bad news.

21:00.134 --> 21:03.468
[Eva] I thought this was behind us,
Ms. Daynes. The subpoena was quashed.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.633
| realize it's an intrusion, ma'am.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.130
I'm not sure you do.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.973
| acknowledge I did wrong.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.264
30 years ago, I gave bid specs
to a contractor

21:12.396 --> 21:14.478
to save my husband's life. Mea culpa.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.472
Ma'am, I--

21:15.608 --> 21:18.145
This notion that I have to keep
addressing it and re-addressing it

21:18.277 --> 21:19.984
like it's this original sin...

21:20.112 --> 21:22.228
That declaration will put
all of that to bed.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.320
How?

21:23.449 --> 21:26.157
It attests you've had no contact
with contractor Eric Little

21:26.285 --> 21:27.821
in the last three decades.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.742
The FBI has no proof to the contrary,
only a wild conspiracy theory.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.950
My husband was a lawyer,
a damn good one.

21:35.211 --> 21:36.747
| know how this works.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.415
-Ma'am?
- Isign this,

21:38.547 --> 21:40.333
and the wolves are on me.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.879
| get deposed, cross-examined,

21:44.011 --> 21:45.513
every word gets parsed.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.925
And I will be here to defend you.

21:48.057 --> 21:51.516
If you want to defend me,
don't make me sign this.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.100
| wish I didn't have to.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.095
But I promise you, this document...

21:55.231 --> 21:59.566
This is our best chance at ending
this investigation before it gets worse.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.114
Can't believe you did
the Inca Trail in three days.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.530
It's not as impressive as it sounds.
| had great guides.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.074
Uh, Seth, the President
needs those talking points.

22:12.206 --> 22:13.116
Right.

22:13.249 --> 22:16.207
-Uh, good to talk to you, Dan.
-And you.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.576
He's a nice guy.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.666
-Smart, too.
-Yes, he, um--

22:21.799 --> 22:23.790
Senators are here, Roosevelt Room.

22:23.926 --> 22:26.839
-Right. Uh...
-Go. Save the world.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.427
| can keep myself busy.

22:28.556 --> 22:29.887
[Emily] Thank you.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.507
-[Damone] You can't be serious.
-[Aaron] We're not talking about

22:32.643 --> 22:35.726
the elimination of sanctions, Senator.
We're talking about loosening them.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.937
Our proposal allows only
for a civilian-enrichment program.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.976
And a strict monitoring regime
would be in place.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.976
A regime whose success will depend
on Hassan's agreement

22:43.112 --> 22:46.150
to abide by the very norms
he's shown nothing but contempt for.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.990
But you're asking us to believe
he's turned over a new leaf.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.610
[Tom] No, Senator. We're asking you
to help us bring the Verona home,;

22:51.745 --> 22:53.201
300 of our sailors,
many of them wounded,

22:53.330 --> 22:54.946
none of whom deserve
to be abandoned.

22:55.082 --> 22:58.791
We agree. But what price
are we willing to pay for their return?

22:58.919 --> 23:01.001
Kunami is a can that can be kicked
down the road.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.746
The Verona's a can that could sink.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.837
We'll need to take this before
the whole Foreign Relations Committee.

23:06.969 --> 23:09.051
-We don't have that kind of time.
-We understand.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.796
-We'll move fast.
-Please do. Thank you.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.597
So, "Take it before the whole committee."
"Move fast."

23:20.733 --> 23:22.440
That's congressional code
for "duck and cover."

23:22.568 --> 23:25.230
Which means we're not gonna be able
to negotiate the crew to safety.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.693
Sir, they need you in Command Ops.

23:27.948 --> 23:29.859
-The Verona's sinking.
-Let's go.

23:34.246 --> 23:38.080
[Griffin] The, uh, primary bilge pumps
have failed, sir.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.369
The auxiliary pumps are failing.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.879
We're taking on water
faster than we can get rid of it.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.540
How much time
do you think you have?

23:43.672 --> 23:47.381
Five, six hours till she submerges.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.250
Sir, I want you to know,

23:49.386 --> 23:52.720
the crew is not afraid.
Non sibi sed patriae.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.885
"Not for self, but for country."

23:55.017 --> 23:57.475
-The Navy motto.
-Yes, sir.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.480
It's a privilege to serve.

23:59.605 --> 24:03.439
A privilege every sailor on board
would gladly die for.

24:07.029 --> 24:09.896
That privilege will not require
that sacrifice, Captain.

24:10.032 --> 24:11.739
Not today.

24:11.867 --> 24:12.902
Yes, sir.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.571
Verona out.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.616
[Aaron] Mr. President, Senator Cowling
just got back to me.

24:21.752 --> 24:23.538
Congress won't allow
loosening the sanctions.

24:23.671 --> 24:26.254
She's urging the Administration
to find a diplomatic solution.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.874
It doesn't help us now, but she's right.
We need to find another way.

24:29.009 --> 24:32.377
Sir, if I were advising the emir,
I'd say he's playing it perfectly:

24:33.138 --> 24:35.220
castigating America for violating
his country's sovereignty.

24:35.349 --> 24:37.636
[Emily] Knowing that we can't use force
without looking like

24:37.768 --> 24:40.385
we've wildly over-reacted
to a problem they think we've created.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.762
We didn't create a monsoon out at sea.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.185
He's got wiggle room, sir. We don't.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.230
This crisis is tailor-made
to enhance his prestige.

24:50.072 --> 24:54.782
Admiral, do we have enough data
to re-create the Verona's collision?

24:54.910 --> 24:56.617
Yes, sir. We'll get right on it.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.293
Peyton Lane's phone pinged at 10:26 A.M.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.584
outside her hotel in Dupont Circle
before going offline.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.673
<i>The demand video
was uploaded at 1112,.</i>

25:10.801 --> 25:13.634
Okay, build in time for her captors
to get her to the safe house

25:13.762 --> 25:16.379
-and set up the video shoot.
-[keyboard clacking]

25:18.183 --> 25:19.844
[computer beeping]

25:21.478 --> 25:22.855
Four-mile radius.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.891
[knock at door, door opens]

25:25.524 --> 25:28.437
This came in for you, Hannah.
It was dropped off by messenger.

25:28.569 --> 25:30.435
-Security's already cleared it.
-Thanks, Mike.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.117
[cellphone beeping]

25:40.497 --> 25:41.828
[phone ringing]

25:41.957 --> 25:43.539
[man] Two hours left, Agent Wells.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.785
Or the next time you see Ms. Lane,
you'll have to identify her by her teeth.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.081
We're working on extradition,

25:48.213 --> 25:50.329
but we can't okay that
unless we have proof of life.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.298
-You have to--
-[dial tone]

25:53.719 --> 25:56.051
[Lyor] So, she doesn't get it from you.

25:56.180 --> 25:59.718
[Daniel] No, I can't say
I've ever had kombucha.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.558
Try storing vinegar
in a locker for a decade.

26:02.686 --> 26:05.178
-Then add bleach and urine.
-Thank you, Lyor.

26:05.314 --> 26:08.102
-You can go earn your taxpayer money now.
-[chuckling]

26:08.609 --> 26:10.350
-That's an interesting fella.
-Yeah.

26:10.486 --> 26:11.976
I'm sorry I keep abandoning you.

26:12.112 --> 26:15.104
Don't be. I love meeting your friends.
They think the world of you.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.151
-Hey, Mr. Rhodes.
-Heya, Matt.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.615
Who's Matt?

26:18.744 --> 26:20.280
Oh, he works in
the word-processing pool.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.574
| think he's got a little
something going with Dana.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.084
-Who's Dana?
-She works with Hank in personnel.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.620
-Oh.
-[cellphone buzzing]

26:26.752 --> 26:28.493
I'm so sorry.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.712
-I will come find you.
-I'll be the guy beaming with pride.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.128
[beeping]

26:40.224 --> 26:42.591
You're watching a re-creation
of the collision, sir.

26:42.726 --> 26:43.932
Based on what?

26:44.061 --> 26:47.850
Enhanced satellite imagery
and data from the ship's AIS.

26:47.981 --> 26:51.724
The Verona was traveling 160 degrees
southeast at roughly 15 knots.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.648
The barge was heading northeast
at 12 knots,

26:54.780 --> 26:56.066
four points off the port quarter.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.360
If everyone held course,
it would've been a near miss.

26:58.492 --> 27:01.735
The barge suddenly veered
to four points off the starboard bow

27:01.870 --> 27:04.282
and increased its speed to 18 knots.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.416
That proves that the barge
ran into our ship on purpose.

27:09.545 --> 27:12.128
Well, given the barge's sudden change
in speed and direction,

27:12.256 --> 27:13.462
that would be my conclusion,
Mr. President.

27:13.590 --> 27:16.332
Ambassador Salini's on his way
to discuss sanctions.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.336
We'll be discussing something else.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.140
This proves nothing.

27:25.269 --> 27:28.682
It proves that your garbage barge
deliberately rammed our ship.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.396
No. It was dark.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.352
Bad weather.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.397
Maybe the barge's radar malfunctioned,
like the Verona's.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.108
Maybe it was tacking to avoid a wave.

27:38.240 --> 27:41.107
Or maybe the captain was acting
at the behest of your government.

27:41.243 --> 27:44.326
Here is the one thing
that we know for sure.

27:44.454 --> 27:48.163
Your ship was in our waters,
violating our sovereignty.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.124
Sir, we've been over this.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.119
Yes, we have.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.212
And I was summoned
to discuss sanctions.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.796
The sanctions remain.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.500
You have turned my country
into a pariah.

28:00.137 --> 28:01.844
The people don't have enough for food.

28:01.972 --> 28:05.090
Because the emir insists on spending
your nation's capital on weapons.

28:05.225 --> 28:08.263
How we dispense our treasury
is our choice.

28:08.395 --> 28:11.683
So is how we deal
with American aggression.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.681
If you violate our sovereignty again,

28:13.817 --> 28:16.479
we will consider it a declaration of war.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.490
Kunami can't afford
to go to war with us, sir.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.700
Which is why they'll drag in
other countries.

28:24.828 --> 28:27.445
We fire on them, they fire
on our client states: Israel, Turkey.

28:27.581 --> 28:30.073
Pulling in Syria and Iran,
forcing us to negotiate.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.246
And the Verona and its crew
will be lost.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.913
-[door opens]
-No.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.787
[Chernow] Mr. President,
the Fifth Fleet is in place

28:35.923 --> 28:38.085
and awaiting instructions, sir.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.457
Thank you, Admiral.

28:40.344 --> 28:43.928
Have them deploy a rescue vessel.
Fly a flag at half-mast.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.512
Aaron, see if you can catch
the ambassador.

28:45.641 --> 28:48.884
Tell him they can have our ship.
We're bringing our people home.

28:49.019 --> 28:51.056
Mr. President, the emirate
will get our technology,

28:51.188 --> 28:52.895
and the VDR will confirm we were spying.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.890
Respectfully, sir,
it will be a national humiliation.

28:56.026 --> 28:58.893
Respectfully, Admiral,
our personnel is more important.

28:59.029 --> 29:02.442
Well, I'd agree, sir, if we could predict
how Kunami will respond.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.532
There's no way to know what
the emir will do if you call his bluff.

29:05.661 --> 29:08.449
Well, we're gonna find out soon enough
because we're gonna run the blockade.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.741
Admiral...

29:11.124 --> 29:13.502
...if they engage,
sink every ship they've got.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.544
[Davis] Mr. President, this is
Commander Davis of the Wyckoff.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.668
| can confirm that
the crew of the Verona

29:23.804 --> 29:25.966
is now safely aboard our vessel.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.680
And we've recovered all our dead?

29:27.808 --> 29:29.799
Yes, sir. Casualties all accounted for.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.771
I'm not taking my eye off
of that satellite feed

29:35.899 --> 29:38.516
until the Wyckoff crosses
the Kunami line.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.107
You're not going to sign the declaration?

29:46.785 --> 29:49.243
| don't feel comfortable with it.

29:49.371 --> 29:52.238
Please tell me what your issue is,
and I'll... I'll try to address it.

29:52.374 --> 29:55.912
Well, I just feel like
| should have my own lawyer look at it.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.297
Ms. Booker, I work for the White House.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.460
Your interests are aligned
with your family's.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.257
Aren't they?

30:05.345 --> 30:09.009
| told my daughter that I hadn't seen
Eric Little since 1987.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.508
And that's technically not true.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.635
| saw him briefly
about six months ago.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.228
Okay?

30:16.356 --> 30:20.600
A mutual friend died
and left Eric a case of wine.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.819
And he showed up
at my door one day,

30:23.947 --> 30:25.233
out of the blue,

30:26.366 --> 30:29.358
to pass along the news

30:29.494 --> 30:31.906
and give me a bottle of Cab.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.905
-What else did you two talk about?
-Nothing.

30:34.041 --> 30:36.248
He was there two minutes.
That's why it...

30:36.376 --> 30:37.616
slipped my mind.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.710
Your daughter stood before a judge
and asserted

30:39.838 --> 30:43.297
you'd had no contact with Eric Little
in 30 years.

30:43.425 --> 30:44.756
| hadn't.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.667
Not really.

30:46.803 --> 30:49.636
You did, ma'am.
And your daughter is the First Lady.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.389
And she made what John Foerstel
will characterize

30:52.517 --> 30:54.303
as an affirmative misrepresentation.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.677
Add into that her involvement
in defending you,

30:56.813 --> 30:59.020
it begins to look a lot like obstruction.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.486
[indistinct conversations]

31:02.611 --> 31:04.602
Mr. President, this is Commander Davis.

31:04.738 --> 31:07.696
| can confirm the Kunami fleet
is now astern of the Wyckoff.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.690
[applause]

31:11.244 --> 31:12.370
Congratulations, Mr. President.

31:12.496 --> 31:14.078
Thank you. Thank you.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.072
[applause continues]

31:16.208 --> 31:19.200
| need a list of the dead,
numbers for their next of kin.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.126
I've got some phone calls to make.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.665
Yes, sir.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.414
[tearfully] This is Peyton Lane.

31:26.176 --> 31:27.792
It's 2:53 P.M.,

31:27.928 --> 31:29.885
and I am alive and well
as of this recording,

31:30.013 --> 31:32.846
but I won't be unless
Darius Cray is extradited.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.102
Please tell my parents,
Barb and Ed, that I love them.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.683
And my siblings,
Laura Leigh and Sam,

31:36.812 --> 31:38.223
that I love them too--
[static]

31:38.355 --> 31:40.221
She went off book.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.349
She's an only child.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.522
And her parents' names
are Michelle and Phillip.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.066
She would've had, uh,
Foreign Service training, right,

31:48.198 --> 31:49.404
-before she went abroad?
-Yes.

31:49.533 --> 31:51.069
It's mandatory for any assignment.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.238
She's signaling us.

31:53.370 --> 31:56.658
Chuck, can you run
a voice-to-text program?

31:58.959 --> 32:00.120
Isolate the names.

32:02.462 --> 32:06.251
Could be an anagram, or
an alphanumeric code for coordinates.

32:06.383 --> 32:07.714
It would have to be simpler.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.175
She... she only had minutes
to come up with this.

32:10.679 --> 32:13.137
Chuck, isolate the first letter
of each of those names.

32:16.685 --> 32:17.891
Bells.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.136
Church bells?

32:20.272 --> 32:21.262
Too many churches in D.C.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.264
Go with a place. Bells Road?

32:23.400 --> 32:24.936
There's a Bells Drive. It's southeast.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.309
They'd need to take her
to an isolated place.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.858
Check anything under
"construction” or "abandoned."

32:32.242 --> 32:34.609
| got an abandoned apartment building
on Bells and 13th.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.405
That would be the perfect place to...

32:36.538 --> 32:38.120
[door opens, closes]

32:38.248 --> 32:39.704
You're welcome.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.204
[man 1 softly]
Let's go. Entry team, rally.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.713
[cellphone ringing]

32:45.630 --> 32:46.745
Yeah?

32:46.882 --> 32:48.418
Time's up.

32:48.550 --> 32:49.711
[door crashes]

32:49.843 --> 32:51.254
[whispering loudly]
Go, go, go! Breach!

32:55.474 --> 32:57.181
What do you want me to do?

33:00.645 --> 33:01.931
Yeah. All right.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.974
[man 1 whispering]
Hallway clear for entry points.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.643
[phone beeps]

33:06.401 --> 33:07.391
[gun cocks]

33:07.527 --> 33:08.813
-[crash]
-[man] Go! Breach!

33:08.945 --> 33:10.777
-Gun!
-[gunshots]

33:12.782 --> 33:14.489
-What have we got?
-Two Tangos down!

33:14.618 --> 33:16.154
[man 2] All right, we're moving up!

33:16.536 --> 33:18.994
[Daniel] There really used to be
a pool in the White House?

33:19.122 --> 33:21.580
Yep. President Nixon
covered it in 1970,

33:21.708 --> 33:22.914
turned it into a briefing room.

33:23.043 --> 33:25.751
-[laughs] His first mistake.
-Oh, but not his last.

33:25.879 --> 33:26.994
| can't believe it.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.963
My daughter sits at the right hand
of the President.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.798
| always knew you were destined
for greatness.

33:31.927 --> 33:33.383
Oh, I don't know about that.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.594
| got lucky. Not lucky, but...

33:35.722 --> 33:38.009
I'm lucky, too...
that we reconnected.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.304
Hey, you think there's a chance
| might meet your boss?

33:41.436 --> 33:43.973
Today might be tough, but maybe
we can swing by for a second.

33:44.105 --> 33:46.062
-Think I could get a picture?
-Sure.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.023
Good, 'cause I want
to show you something.

33:49.569 --> 33:50.775
It's called the BottleMaven.

33:50.904 --> 33:53.020
Just press a button,
out pops the cork.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.146
A corkscrew.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.943
[laughs] The last word in corkscrews.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.192
And it would mean the world
to my investor group

33:58.328 --> 34:01.161
if I could get a picture
of the President with it.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.037
The President
doesn't endorse products.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.956
No problem.
Uh, he could hold the bottle.

34:09.089 --> 34:10.545
I'll hold the BottleMaven.

34:10.674 --> 34:13.917
Em, you're needed
in Command Ops.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.257
Thank you.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.717
Go get 'em, tiger!

34:18.598 --> 34:20.259
[Tom] Admiral,
do you want to explain to me

34:20.391 --> 34:21.678
how the Wyckoff
forgot Captain Griffin?

34:21.810 --> 34:24.222
[Chernow] They didn't forget him, sir.
He refused to abandon ship.

34:24.353 --> 34:25.936
Mr. President, I'm on with the ambassador.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.396
Kunami will agree to allow
the Wyckoff to head back,

34:28.525 --> 34:29.764
but we need to do it now.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.609
Admiral, order the Wyckoff
to turn around. Get me Captain Griffin.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.492
[Griffin] Mr. President.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.610
[Tom] Captain, you've caused
quite an uproar.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.248
| know, sir. I'm sorry.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.581
Kunami has agreed to allow
the Wyckoff to circle back,

34:46.710 --> 34:49.327
-ferry you out.
-I'm not going, sir.

34:49.462 --> 34:50.918
Captain, this isn't the time to argue.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.503
I'm no sailor, but even I can see

34:52.632 --> 34:55.123
that the ship is sinking faster
than we had anticipated.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.627
| know, sir. I opened the hatches
and the torpedo tubes.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.093
Why the hell would you do that?

34:59.222 --> 35:01.600
I figured out why you want the VDR, sir.

35:01.725 --> 35:04.638
If Kunami gets their hands on it,
they'll figure it out as well.

35:04.769 --> 35:08.433
-Captain, that's not your concern.
-Yes, sir, it is.

35:08.565 --> 35:11.603
| swore an oath to protect
my country and my crew.

35:11.735 --> 35:12.816
My crew is safe.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.105
My country is not.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.978
You flooded the boat.
You've done your duty.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.071
No, sir. Kunami will salvage the vessel.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.281
They'll get the VDR.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.909
| initiated the emergency
scuttle sequence,

35:23.038 --> 35:26.121
but I need to be here to make sure
it works. The detonators are on a timer.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.832
Everyone out.
Give me the room now, please.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.339
[alarm blaring on the Verona ]

35:37.510 --> 35:38.636
[chuckles]

35:38.762 --> 35:40.548
Son, where are you from?

35:40.680 --> 35:42.136
Billings, Montana, sir.

35:43.516 --> 35:45.507
Billings, Montana.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.180
Beautiful country, isn't it?

35:47.312 --> 35:49.474
Yes, sir. It is.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.181
Your family there?

35:52.317 --> 35:53.478
Yes, sir.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.692
Mom, two sisters.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.895
You got a girl?

35:58.948 --> 36:00.564
Sir?

36:00.700 --> 36:02.031
A girlfriend, Captain.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.821
Yes, sir.

36:03.953 --> 36:06.285
Son, your whole life is in front of you,

36:06.998 --> 36:08.659
things you can't even imagine,

36:08.792 --> 36:10.578
beautiful, wonderful things,

36:10.710 --> 36:12.371
things to live for.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.918
| need you to trust me.
We will handle this.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.843
Your story's not supposed to end here.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.301
You need to come home.

36:26.101 --> 36:28.217
Let me bring you home.

36:33.358 --> 36:34.940
I'm sorry, sir.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.527
It's been an honor.

36:39.656 --> 36:40.896
Verona out.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.504
[Hannah] The last call made by one
of the captors was to a burner phone.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.044
We tracked the location of that
burner phone to Ms. Cray's hotel.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.632
[Damian] And when we find that phone,

37:01.761 --> 37:04.002
we're not just gonna charge
Mrs. Cray with kidnapping.

37:04.139 --> 37:07.723
We're gonna charge her with the
premeditated murder of Charlotte Thorn.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.762
And everything she's done
since Thorn's murder -

37:09.894 --> 37:12.352
every lie she's told,
every move she's made -

37:12.480 --> 37:13.891
is going to be evidence.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.734
| had nothing to do
with Thorn's murder.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.528
We don't believe you.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.116
[Oliver] Agent Wells,

37:27.245 --> 37:29.236
| think it behooves you
to listen to my client.

37:29.372 --> 37:30.407
Make it quick.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.406
The arms business was mine.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.283
And it needed Charlotte Thorn.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.909
That makes no sense.

37:36.045 --> 37:37.547
She was obsessed with my husband.

37:37.672 --> 37:39.583
The attention Darius drew
because of her

37:39.716 --> 37:42.253
meant that I could operate
without scrutiny.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.717
My mistake was involving him at all.

37:44.846 --> 37:46.587
He got sloppy.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.924
| didn't kill Charlotte Thorn.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.970
| needed her.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.519
[knocking at door]
Em?

38:01.446 --> 38:02.311
Good night.

38:21.174 --> 38:24.337
All right, I got you kabobs,
shawarma, falafel,

38:24.469 --> 38:25.800
something with
phyllo dough in it,

38:25.929 --> 38:28.796
hot sauce, cold sauce,
lukewarm sauce.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.844
He didn't want me.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.854
He wanted the White House.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.307
| know.

38:40.443 --> 38:43.401
You know, at least
if he'd asked for a kidney,

38:43.530 --> 38:46.898
| could've convinced myself
that I was family,

38:47.033 --> 38:50.071
his daughter,
someone he had to turn to.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.664
But after 23 years,
you know what I meant to him?

38:57.502 --> 38:59.664
[voice breaking]
A corkscrew.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.586
Listen, 'cause
I'm only gonna say this once

39:04.717 --> 39:08.005
and you need to take it on board,

39:08.137 --> 39:10.754
internalize it, and remember it.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.174
You're the greatest thing
since sliced bread.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.393
And if this guy doesn't see that,
then he doesn't like bread.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.388
And when I say bread, it's a metaphor,

39:19.524 --> 39:24.644
because you're not remotely bread-like,
except insofar as bread is great.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.109
Fundamentally great, like water.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.118
Or air.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.238
Or you.

39:46.009 --> 39:47.625
Yeah.

39:49.679 --> 39:51.795
[Hannah] Well,
Catherine Cray was right.

39:51.931 --> 39:54.218
Her business started booming
after Charlotte Thorn

39:54.350 --> 39:56.512
started pointing fingers
at her husband.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.137
-So Cray didn't Kill her.
-Nope.

40:01.316 --> 40:03.353
Which means we're back at square one.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.145
Well...

40:06.154 --> 40:08.942
...sometimes square one's
not a bad place to be.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.814
[Chuck] You guys have to see this.

40:12.869 --> 40:15.156
When it turned out Darius Cray
didn't kill Charlotte Thorn,

40:15.288 --> 40:17.620
| started looking through
everything again.

40:17.749 --> 40:20.662
| dug up security cams from the bank
behind Thorn's hotel.

40:20.793 --> 40:23.626
-Anything suspicious?
-Outside the hotel, no.
