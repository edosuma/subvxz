[Shushing]

34:35.483 --> 34:38.318
We're gonna have
a sing-off.

34:38.353 --> 34:40.938
- Karen, Ivy, get up.
- Oh, no.

34:40.989 --> 34:42.156
- Get up.
- Seriously?

34:42.190 --> 34:45.359
Hey, get up.

34:45.393 --> 34:46.360
Sing-off!

34:46.393 --> 34:48.579
[Laughter]

34:48.612 --> 34:50.914
- [Laughs] I'll do it.
- I'm not doing it.

34:50.949 --> 34:52.783
Dennis,
you're the judge.

34:52.833 --> 34:54.284
- I'm on team Ivy.
- Team Karen!

34:54.335 --> 34:56.536
- What are you, afraid?
- No, no.

34:56.571 --> 34:59.173
I'm not afraid.
You're drunk.

34:59.207 --> 35:01.291
Look, I know
he's screwing Rebecca.

35:01.342 --> 35:02.709
- What?
- She's your new best friend.

35:02.743 --> 35:04.928
You expect me to believe
you didn't know?

35:04.963 --> 35:06.764
I didn't.

35:06.798 --> 35:08.682
Come on, you two.
No secret deals.

35:08.716 --> 35:11.885
Ivy, you go first.

It's on.
Place your bets.

[Overlapping chatter,
laughter]

38:18.740 --> 38:20.540
Dev.

38:20.575 --> 38:21.908
I just asked you
to marry me,

38:21.942 --> 38:23.210
and you ran off
to go to some party.

38:23.244 --> 38:24.878
I didn't know
there was a party.

38:24.912 --> 38:26.246
Well, fine, but when
you found one, you thought,

38:26.280 --> 38:27.831
"great, let's go
and have a good time.

38:27.882 --> 38:29.249
Forget about the stupid sod
who wants to marry me."

38:29.283 --> 38:31.001
Stop it.
That isn't what happened!

38:31.052 --> 38:33.553
Do you have any idea how much
I've sacrificed for you?

38:33.588 --> 38:35.172
I could be in Washington,

38:35.223 --> 38:36.840
but instead,
I stayed in New York

38:36.891 --> 38:38.475
and let Denby
take a crowbar to my career

38:38.509 --> 38:40.644
so you could be
in this stupid show.

38:40.678 --> 38:41.928
Don't ever call
this show stupid.

38:41.962 --> 38:43.730
Fine, it's a brilliant show.

38:43.765 --> 38:46.016
Whatever.

38:46.067 --> 38:48.986
You never said anything
to me about Washington.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.989
You're not the only one
who can withhold information.

38:52.023 --> 38:53.824
R.J. helped me
to find a job in D.C.

38:53.858 --> 38:55.409
- Ugh, great, R.J.
- Yeah, R.J.,

38:55.443 --> 38:57.444
R.J. who at least makes
the effort to listen to me.

38:57.478 --> 38:59.079
Well, maybe you should
go be with R.J. then!

38:59.113 --> 39:00.998
I was with her!

39:01.032 --> 39:03.033
In our apartment.

39:03.084 --> 39:04.835
And I came this close
to sleeping with her,

39:04.869 --> 39:06.420
but I stopped myself,
because in that moment,

39:06.454 --> 39:08.955
I knew I only wanted
to be with you.

39:08.989 --> 39:13.210
I had to come up here
to see you, to be with you.

39:13.261 --> 39:15.879
I don't want us to come apart
like this, Karen.

39:15.930 --> 39:19.299
I want to be
with you always.

39:23.104 --> 39:25.188
Karen.

39:25.223 --> 39:28.642
I cannot decide
to get married during Tech...

39:28.676 --> 39:31.311
Particularly to someone
who's cheating on me!

39:47.078 --> 39:48.462
What are you guys doing?

39:48.496 --> 39:50.080
Something I hope
I don't regret.

39:50.114 --> 39:51.665
We talked it over,
and you should go to Boston.

39:51.699 --> 39:53.750
Stop it.
No.

39:53.801 --> 39:55.419
Eileen is right.
Tom is right.

39:55.470 --> 39:56.887
You have never been good
at separating

39:56.921 --> 39:58.338
your work
and your personal life.

39:58.372 --> 40:01.007
What happened between us
is between us,

40:01.041 --> 40:04.094
not you and the show.
Us.

40:04.145 --> 40:06.596
I'm not going to let them
steamroll me.

40:06.647 --> 40:08.432
- Nobody's steamrolling you.
- This is your life, mom.

40:08.483 --> 40:10.600
We're not going
to let you quit your life.

40:12.804 --> 40:15.238
If I go...

40:15.273 --> 40:16.306
You're coming with me.

40:16.340 --> 40:18.291
It's spring break, honey.

40:18.326 --> 40:21.044
You got both of us
for two weeks.

Hi.

40:46.187 --> 40:49.189
Hey.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.119
Can I buy you a drink?

41:02.153 --> 41:04.187
Sure.

41:05.773 --> 41:08.708
Vodka soda.

41:08.743 --> 41:10.944
