Do you want me to make you some coffee?

04:41.080 --> 04:43.173
What is it?
Am I doing something wrong?

04:43.282 --> 04:46.774
- No, of course not.

I don't know.

04:50.022 --> 04:54.015
Oh, we better go.
Herb's probably
going berserk by now.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.994

Commander Chuck Street
with traffic. How's it going?

06:00.693 --> 06:04.094
we've got a slowdown on that
south bound Pasadena freeway.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.257
This is the Dave Hull program
on KRLA,

06:07.366 --> 06:10.824
but we are gonna
interrupt the show now
for this special announce--

06:10.937 --> 06:14.100
Don't you want to hear
what happened?

06:14.207 --> 06:16.107
No, not really.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.178
If it's important, I guess
they'll let us know anyway.

06:19.278 --> 06:23.442
Ah, a smilel
Okay, now we're
gettin' somewhere.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.279
All right, Mr. No-Sleep,
I have something for you.

06:26.385 --> 06:29.047
What's three miles long
and has an I.Q of 165?

06:29.155 --> 06:31.055
A Saint Patrick's Day parade.

06:31.157 --> 06:34.126
Actually,
it's a Cinco de Mayo parade.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.390
I can't sleep anymore,
Herb.
Are you gonna be all right?

06:37.497 --> 06:39.624
I don't wantyou nodding off
at the wheel.
No, no, I'm fine.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.292
We can switch.
I'm fine. I'm okay.

06:42.401 --> 06:46.462
I don't know.
I don't know.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.973
My job is a dead end.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.568
I feel weird,
like I'm from another
planet or something.

06:53.679 --> 06:58.309
Ellen kissed me on the top
of my head this morning
and said, "Have a nice day. "

06:58.417 --> 07:01.215
- Can you believe that?
- What's wrong with that?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.414
Bank tellers say,
"Have a nice day."

07:04.524 --> 07:07.755
The cashier at the supermarket
says, "Have a nice day."

07:07.860 --> 07:11.853
I just think that somehow
yourwife should say something
better than, "Have a nice day."

07:11.964 --> 07:15.900
You're losing your mind, Ed.
How long have you had insomnia?

07:16.002 --> 07:20.302
My last good night's sleep?
Yeah, the full eight hours.

07:20.406 --> 07:26.276
Seems like... 1980.
Yeah, the summer of 1980.

07:26.379 --> 07:29.780
You're in bed. You can't sleep.
I don't see the problem.

07:29.882 --> 07:33.613
You go to the airport,
catch the midnight flight
to Las Vegas.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.619
Nobody sleeps there.
Very funny, Herb.

07:35.721 --> 07:38.622
No, listen, I'm serious.
You need some action.
I'm not a gambler.

07:38.724 --> 07:41.625
Don't gamble.
Have a few drinks.
See a show.

07:41.727 --> 07:43.957
Get loose.
Get laid.
Oh, wonderful.

07:44.063 --> 07:47.123
I'm sure Ellen would love it.
You'll be home
before she wakes up.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.133
Sex isn't the problem.

07:49.235 --> 07:54.298
When was the last time
you fucked your wife?
You're a classy guy, Herb.

07:54.407 --> 07:57.308
Up in Vegas, there's
a beautiful, young girl
named Melissa.

07:57.410 --> 08:02.404
She will do anything
you want for $200 an hour.
Two hundred dollars?

08:02.515 --> 08:05.006
Anything you want.
Anything.
For example?

08:05.117 --> 08:07.347
if you want,
she'll dress up
like Santa Claus.

08:07.453 --> 08:10.013
Would she bring me a pony?
You're having trouble
with this concept.

08:10.122 --> 08:14.024
I'm talking about the universe
of infinite possibility.
No such thing.

08:14.126 --> 08:16.185
The only limits are
money and imagination.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.354
Sorry.
I'm a little short on both.

08:18.464 --> 08:20.523
Hello, Fielding.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.864
How much would I have to pay one
of these women for sympathy?

08:23.970 --> 08:26.871
Sympathy?
Very kinky, Ed.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.873
I'll see you at lunch.

09:12.785 --> 09:15.686
Ed Okin.

09:17.456 --> 09:20.084
They're claiming we've got
a synchronization problem.

09:20.192 --> 09:23.958
Naturally, this has nothing
to do with their god-awful
carrier tracking loop.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.897
They want full tolerance
checks on all buggers,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.968
sensors and corresponding
transducers.

09:30.069 --> 09:33.095
Scanners seem to check out.

09:33.205 --> 09:36.697
Yeah, but that's on the uplink.
The problem is downlink.

09:36.809 --> 09:39.334
Ed, have you got
the signal-to-noise ratio
on the downlink?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.139
Ed?

09:43.249 --> 09:45.183
Yeah?

09:45.284 --> 09:48.219
- have you got it?
- What's that?

09:51.123 --> 09:56.755
Yep, we're having
synchronization problems.

09:56.862 --> 10:00.593
I need the signal-to-noise ratio
on the downlink.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.669
Signal-to-noise.
Right. Um, mm-hmm.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.431
- Right.
- I've got it here.

10:06.539 --> 10:09.770
I was just, uh--

10:09.875 --> 10:13.811
Uh... signal-to-noise,
signal-to-noise.

10:13.913 --> 10:17.872
- Signal-to-noise: 5.3 db.
- Five point three?

10:17.983 --> 10:20.008
What modulation scheme?

10:20.119 --> 10:23.885
- Uh, B.P.S.k.
- "B.P.S.k."?

10:26.525 --> 10:28.459
Isn't that correct?

10:30.162 --> 10:34.690
we switched
to Q.P.S.K. two weeks ago.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.531
Q.P.S.K.?

10:38.637 --> 10:38.738
It was incredible.
I can't tell you
how I felt.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.603
It was incredible.
I can't tell you
how I felt.

10:40.706 --> 10:42.640
I wish I'd seen it.
The whole place was excited.

10:42.742 --> 10:46.337
I couldn't talk my wife
out of going to the orchid show.
Everyone was there.

10:51.550 --> 10:57.352
- if you missed it,
you can see it on cable.
- His family was there.

10:57.456 --> 11:00.289
Listen, I'm gonna go home
and try to take a nap.

11:00.392 --> 11:02.383
If I don't come back,
can you get another ride?

11:02.495 --> 11:05.589
Sure. Absolutely.
Go home and get some sleep.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.265
Yes.

11:14.473 --> 11:17.237

-Just get me out ofhere now.
- It's all right. It's over.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.235
what happened?
They must still be inside.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.905
There were, I think,
two ofthem. One ofthem
jumped on my hood.

19:09.014 --> 19:12.814
There was a big face.
I didn't get a really good--
N-N-Nothing happened.

19:12.918 --> 19:16.752
- What?
- It was my fault. All they did
was chase me. That's all.

19:16.855 --> 19:19.085

I'm off duty. Unless you
want to file a complaint--

19:19.191 --> 19:21.250

20:25.257 --> 20:28.158
No, those things

Yeah. Nothing turns out

does it?

20:34.232 --> 20:36.666
That's for sure.

I don't know what--

20:40.605 --> 20:43.836
Just get me home,
okay?

20:43.942 --> 20:46.342
Where do you live?

20:48.947 --> 20:51.848

Listen, Ed, if there's
anyway I can thank you--

21:17.909 --> 21:21.970
Oh, I'm still not sure
what happened.
Neither am I.

21:22.080 --> 21:26.312

to go to the police?
Pull over.

21:26.418 --> 21:30.912
Huh? Here?
Pull over.
I'm gonna be sick.

21:54.613 --> 21:56.547

21:56.648 --> 21:59.515
Mm-hmm.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.779

those guys?

22:01.887 --> 22:05.288
No.

22:05.390 --> 22:08.655
Did they
take anything?

22:08.760 --> 22:14.130
No suitcase?
No. Please don't ask me
anything now, okay?

22:14.232 --> 22:17.292
You mind if I ask
your name?

22:17.402 --> 22:19.962
Diana.

22:20.071 --> 22:23.006

22:35.086 --> 22:40.683

No, it belongs

22:57.776 --> 22:59.767

23:01.046 --> 23:04.538
Anyone aboard?

23:04.649 --> 23:07.777
Diana.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.047
You're not supposed to come here anymore.

23:10.155 --> 23:12.282
Larry, I'm sort of in trouble.

23:12.390 --> 23:14.449
Let me just stay here
tonight, okay?

23:14.559 --> 23:16.720
Jackwon't know anything
about it. I promise.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.728
You no longer have
the use of this boat.

23:20.732 --> 23:24.463
I must still have
some clothes on board.
Let me shower and change.

23:26.671 --> 23:29.469
Can I at least use the phone,
please, Larry?

23:29.574 --> 23:32.702
The man says
you no longer exist.

23:32.811 --> 23:35.541
I'm in trouble, Larry.

23:37.849 --> 23:40.044
You're a pig, Larry.

23:40.151 --> 23:43.314
Good night, Diana.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.718
Is everything okay?

23:51.830 --> 23:53.798
Could you take me to Hollywood?

23:55.700 --> 23:58.931
Just a ride to Hollywood, okay?

Hello.
Christie.

Di, where have you been?
What's happening?

29:09.848 --> 29:15.684
Uh, listen,
I'm kind of in the middle
ofa real bad situation.

29:15.787 --> 29:19.086
Me too.
We're gonna be out here
all night.

29:19.190 --> 29:23.092
Can I come over?
Now?
Let me talk to Bud.

29:23.194 --> 29:26.254
Chris, look,
I need a friend.
It's serious.

29:26.364 --> 29:30.266
Yeah, come on over.
I'll leave a drive-on for you.
Thanks.

29:36.541 --> 29:39.601
Open the fuckin' door!
Open up, you bitch!

29:39.711 --> 29:42.612
Friend of yours?
who's in there?
Diana!

29:47.886 --> 29:50.912
Who's this?
Looks like a narc.

29:51.022 --> 29:55.618
- He's a friend.
- She makes friends so easily.

29:55.727 --> 29:59.629
What is your problem?
Hey! I work for my money,
andso does he.

29:59.731 --> 30:02.791
Nobody gives me a fuckin' thing,
and I pay my bills!

30:05.403 --> 30:07.769
- Are you her brother?
- Yeah. So what?

30:07.872 --> 30:11.638
- What happened to my clothes?
- I tried to be careful.

30:13.211 --> 30:15.304
Look, she had
a terrible experience--

30:15.413 --> 30:17.381
She is a terrible
experience!

30:17.482 --> 30:19.916
You fly off to Europe
likeyou're hot shit!

30:20.018 --> 30:23.215
You promise--
You promise, but you
don't pay the rent.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.221
They finally
turned the phone off!.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.553
Do you know how much
I had to come up with?

30:27.659 --> 30:29.593
I had to borrow money from Don
to pay the fuckin' rent!

30:29.694 --> 30:33.824
Fine! I'llpay you back!
No problem!

30:33.932 --> 30:36.162
Right, no problem.
Don moved in.
You're movin' out!

30:36.267 --> 30:40.795
- Charlie, lighten up!
- You've been gone three weeks!
You didn't even call me!

30:40.905 --> 30:44.568
Okay, fine!
Give me back my car keys.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.076
I rented it to Artie.

30:47.178 --> 30:50.341
Artie?

30:51.849 --> 30:54.579
You get it back right now.

30:56.387 --> 30:58.548
He drove it up
to San Francisco.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.360
That is a $55,000 car, Charlie.

31:06.464 --> 31:09.991
Jack gave it toyou.
It didn't cost you anything.

31:10.101 --> 31:14.970
- Oh, Charlie.
- You can't just kick her out on the street.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.973
She's always got you.

31:17.075 --> 31:20.704
we're going out.
Don't be here when I get back.

31:20.812 --> 31:24.873
Elvis wouldn't
do what you're doing!
And I knew him!

31:26.317 --> 31:28.808
You didn't know him.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.286
You fucked him maybe,
but you didn't know him!

31:39.263 --> 31:42.357
- You drive a beige Toyota?
- Yes.

31:42.467 --> 31:44.867
I thought so.

31:44.969 --> 31:48.461
The cops towed it away.
Can't be there.

31:48.573 --> 31:52.009
The police towed it?
You shouldn't have
parked there.

31:54.112 --> 31:56.012
Perfect.

31:57.782 --> 32:00.114
Where you going?
To get a taxi.

32:00.218 --> 32:02.277
I've had enough excitement
for one night.
No, this is Los Angeles.

32:02.387 --> 32:04.947
There aren't any taxis.
I'll call one.
I'll call one for you too.

32:05.056 --> 32:08.617
There isn't time.
I'm in a lot of trouble.

32:08.726 --> 32:12.457
No, I'm in trouble now.
It was my car they towed away.

32:12.563 --> 32:15.123
I can get a car.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.963
They could
still be after me.
Who could
still be after you?

32:18.069 --> 32:20.970
Do you know these guys?
No!Just believe me.
I need to get some place...

32:21.072 --> 32:24.132
where I can straighten
this whole thing out.
I have to find my car.

32:24.242 --> 32:27.143
Please?
Please stay with me
a little longer?

32:27.245 --> 32:31.306
I don't want
to go out alone.
This is too weird for me.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.816
Whatever you want.
What do you want?
I'll pay you.

32:33.918 --> 32:38.651
I'm too tired for all this.
I don't need any more shit
in my life right now.

32:38.756 --> 32:40.656
I'm sorry.

32:51.602 --> 32:54.093
They're here.

32:55.840 --> 33:01.437
Not on foot.
You say you can get a car?
Yes.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.305
Sure your brother
won't mind?

33:05.416 --> 33:07.441
Fuck him.

33:46.090 --> 33:48.991
What are you doing?

34:07.211 --> 34:09.610
You can come out now.

34:12.382 --> 34:16.786
Who are those men?
I don't know
who they are exactly.

34:16.888 --> 34:20.289
What does that mean?
I was in Europe,
and I brought something back.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.621
That's what they want.
Somehow they found out.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.458
Drugs?
No!
I swear to God.

34:33.638 --> 34:37.505
I'm getting out.
This is too strange.
No, listen to me.

34:37.608 --> 34:40.304
I have something they want.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.402
It's worth
a great deal of money.

34:43.781 --> 34:46.181
- You want a date?
- What?

34:46.284 --> 34:49.150
Do you want to party?
No!

34:54.192 --> 34:57.252
You want any ludes?
Coke? Hash?

34:57.361 --> 35:00.387
Acid? Grass?
No, Thank you.

35:00.498 --> 35:03.433
No?
All right, no sweat.

35:05.169 --> 35:07.000
Call me.

35:08.206 --> 35:11.266
I don't know who those men are.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.536
if you wanna get out, go ahead.

35:21.385 --> 35:24.286
Get back,
everybody!
Let me go!

35:24.388 --> 35:28.449
I want to see Detective
kalichek, and I mean now!

35:28.559 --> 35:32.017
And... cut!

35:35.900 --> 35:39.427
Did you like that one?
That was fine.
David!

35:39.537 --> 35:43.701
I can make him
more psychotic.
It was fine.
David!

35:43.808 --> 35:47.801
Do they need all
these people just
to film a TV show?

35:47.912 --> 35:50.642
Well, I appreciate
all your help, Ed.

35:50.748 --> 35:53.148
I'll get you to the phone,
and you can call a taxi.

35:53.251 --> 35:56.152
I'm fine now. Thanks, really.

36:03.027 --> 36:05.587
Diana, where have you been?

36:05.696 --> 36:08.756
God!
Do you believe this?

36:08.866 --> 36:11.596
Look at this.

36:11.702 --> 36:14.762
I got three more lines.
"Don't, please, don't"--

36:14.872 --> 36:18.899
I've gotta talk toyou.
Sure.
Oh, David.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.910
Yeah?
How much longer?

36:21.012 --> 36:23.606
Twenty minutes, a half.
Go get warm. All right.
Okay.

36:23.714 --> 36:27.946
Excuse me.
Oh, uh, Chris,
this is Ed.

36:28.052 --> 36:30.111
Hi.
Hello.

36:30.221 --> 36:34.453
Let's go to my motor home.
Uh, you should find a phone
somewhere around here.

36:43.067 --> 36:45.661
Very funny.
Excuse me.

37:07.358 --> 37:11.260
Oh... I'm fine.

37:41.559 --> 37:44.960
Can I helpyou?
No, thanks.

37:45.062 --> 37:47.053
Amazing stuff.

37:47.164 --> 37:49.291
What are you doing here?

37:49.400 --> 37:52.665
I'm waiting for somebody.
She's in there.

37:52.770 --> 37:56.228
You know Christie?
No, no, not really.
We just met.

37:56.340 --> 37:59.138
Uh-huh. Excuse me.

37:59.243 --> 38:01.234
Bud?
Yeah?

38:01.345 --> 38:04.473
For the L.A. Times.
This or this?
They're both shit.

38:04.582 --> 38:06.482
Thank you.
You're welcome.

38:07.718 --> 38:10.812
Christie--
Hi, Di.
Hi, Bud.

38:10.921 --> 38:13.981
Christie, who's the clown
hanging around in front
of your trailer?

38:14.091 --> 38:18.494
Oh, he's--
He's with me, Bud.
Oh, fine.

38:18.596 --> 38:21.963
Christie,
remember to act scared.
This guy has a gun toyour head.

38:22.066 --> 38:24.159
- I know the feeling.
- What?

38:24.268 --> 38:27.169
Oh, nothing.
You look beautiful, honey.

38:27.271 --> 38:30.832
Oh, thanks, Bud.

38:30.941 --> 38:33.171
Good to seeyou, Di.

38:35.613 --> 38:38.844
You want a stick of gum?
No, thanks.

38:40.618 --> 38:46.181
You won't even ask him?
I'd like to help you,
but it's Bud's house.

38:46.290 --> 38:48.451
You live there too.

38:48.559 --> 38:51.323
Christie?
We're all ready for you.

38:51.429 --> 38:54.227
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- Okay.

39:01.739 --> 39:05.140
So will you hold on
to these for me?

39:05.242 --> 39:09.338
Sure.
What is that?

39:09.447 --> 39:11.972
It's a hidden pocket.

39:12.082 --> 39:15.745
- Thanks.
- For what?

39:17.421 --> 39:21.152
- Is there a phone I can use?
- Use the one in Bud's office.

39:21.258 --> 39:23.692
He's on the set right now.
I don't think he'll mind.

39:23.794 --> 39:26.820
This won't take long.

39:26.931 --> 39:28.831
Hello.

39:28.933 --> 39:31.925
I'm sorry,
I must speak to Jack.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.970
would you tell him
it's Diana?

39:34.071 --> 39:38.701
Miss Diana,
whoever you are--
I'm a friend of Jack's.

39:38.809 --> 39:41.539
I don't give a good goddamn!
if you call here again--

39:41.645 --> 39:45.877
Whoever you are,
you better not hang up
on me this time.

39:45.983 --> 39:50.886
This is his wife.
Don't call back ever!

39:52.990 --> 39:56.551
His wife.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.594
What's she doing there?

39:58.696 --> 40:02.132
His wife?
She probably lives there.

40:02.233 --> 40:06.397
Not for years.
They barely speak.

40:06.504 --> 40:08.734
Bizarre.

40:08.839 --> 40:10.830
Go ahead.

40:14.745 --> 40:17.179
I'm sorry, you folks are
gonna have to leave now.

40:17.281 --> 40:20.910
- We're friends of Bud Herman's.
- Mr. Herman sent me over.

40:21.018 --> 40:23.748
He wants you to leave now.

40:25.189 --> 40:28.590
Fine.
We're going.

40:28.692 --> 40:30.751
What about my cab?
I'll take you to your car.

40:30.861 --> 40:32.920
Let's just
get out of here.

40:34.865 --> 40:37.265
do you know where downtown
they take the cars?

40:37.368 --> 40:41.099
I've gotta get ahold
of Hamid. Shit.
do you know where to go?

40:41.205 --> 40:46.268
No, I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing.
We're going to find my car.

40:46.377 --> 40:48.937
Would you help me, please?
Just a little more.

40:49.046 --> 40:51.446
No! I've gotta go home.
No more.

40:51.549 --> 40:54.950
I've got problems
of my own to deal with.
How do you think I feel?

40:55.052 --> 40:59.113
You're all I've got.
Well, that's hard
to believe.

40:59.223 --> 41:01.783
You're tellin' me.

41:05.496 --> 41:09.899
if you want any more
help from me, I wanna
know what's going on.

41:12.002 --> 41:13.902
You wanna know
what's going on?
Yes.

41:14.004 --> 41:16.734
All right.
Have a seat.

41:18.676 --> 41:20.644
Okay.

41:24.014 --> 41:25.982
They killed him.

41:26.083 --> 41:28.984
- killed who?
- Hasi.

41:29.086 --> 41:31.316
"Hasi"?

41:31.422 --> 41:34.255
In the parking lot.
I-- I was with him.

41:34.358 --> 41:37.156
He was waiting for me.
The stones were his.

41:40.264 --> 41:45.759
- We have to get the police.
- No, I can't. I smuggled them in.

41:45.869 --> 41:50.101
- What stones?
- Six perfect emeralds.

41:50.207 --> 41:52.232
They're priceless.

41:52.343 --> 41:57.337
They killed this guy
for six emeralds?

41:58.616 --> 42:00.516
How'd you get involved in all this?

42:00.618 --> 42:06.056
The stones are from the scepter
of an ancient Persian king.

42:06.156 --> 42:09.557
Remember when the Shah fell
and the royal family fled Iran?

42:09.660 --> 42:14.927
The treasury was looted.
Somebody got away with
a good part ofthe crown jewels.

42:15.032 --> 42:18.900
Hasi was "somebody's" cousin.

42:19.003 --> 42:23.565
Um... he was gonna
give me $25,000.

42:23.674 --> 42:26.734
So I went to Zurich.
I went to a vault.

42:26.844 --> 42:30.940
Everything went fine.
He met me at the airport.

42:31.048 --> 42:36.577
- Who killed Hasi?
- They wanted the stones.

42:36.687 --> 42:39.850
If I lose the stones,
I'm dead for sure.

42:41.558 --> 42:44.459
The police can't help me.

42:44.561 --> 42:47.052
I'm one of the bad guys.

42:47.164 --> 42:49.724
Who were those men
chasing you at the airport?

42:49.833 --> 42:53.735
I don't know.
I've got to make some kind
of deal with them.

42:53.837 --> 42:57.773
- With who?
- That's what I have to find out.

42:57.875 --> 43:02.710
I know they're all Iranians
or Persians or something. I--

43:02.813 --> 43:06.305
If they're on visas,
they don't want trouble.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.011
Well, this is kind
of outside my field.
Oh, Christ.

43:09.119 --> 43:12.418
I can't get ahold of Jack.
He would help me.

43:12.523 --> 43:15.788
- Who's Jack?
- He's a friend of mine.

43:15.893 --> 43:19.727
- Is he involved in this?
-Jack? No!

43:19.830 --> 43:22.560
Jack doesn't need any more money.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.499
I guess he doesn't
need me anymore either.

43:30.507 --> 43:33.738
Maybe if you explained
to the police that you
were doing a job--

43:33.844 --> 43:38.577
That I'm a smuggler?
No.

43:38.682 --> 43:43.085
Okay, so now what?

43:43.187 --> 43:47.920
I know someone else
who could help me.

43:48.025 --> 43:49.925
Would you help me
get to him?

43:54.531 --> 43:57.091
It's my only way out of this.

43:59.703 --> 44:01.694
No.

44:01.805 --> 44:04.740
You did it before
at the airport.

44:04.842 --> 44:06.742
I'm not sure what I did
at the airport.

44:06.844 --> 44:08.869
You saved my life.

44:10.748 --> 44:14.377
They don't know who you are.
Right now they don't know
where I am.

44:14.485 --> 44:17.113
Just stay with me
for a little while longer.

44:18.822 --> 44:21.052
How do you know
you can trust me?

44:21.158 --> 44:24.218
Because I know men.

45:06.804 --> 45:09.204
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

45:09.306 --> 45:11.638
What am I doing here?
This is insane.

45:11.742 --> 45:14.870
I'd do it myself,
but I don't know who's there.

45:14.978 --> 45:17.811
I promise I won't ask
anything else.

45:28.058 --> 45:30.720
This is awfully good, sir.
I think you can feel
very confident with that.

45:30.828 --> 45:35.788
We'll just raise
the shoulder a little,
put a tuck in there. Good.

Hi, I'm Pete Ellis, the Dodge
dealer. You know, there's only
one way to sell used cars.

01:02:48.794 --> 01:02:51.763
Howabout this?
For3,995, an '81 Impala wagon.

01:03:01.407 --> 01:03:04.808
Pete Ellis Dodge is known
for vans and van conversions.

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:07.538
Over 1 50 new and used in stock,
like this '79 Chevy van.

01:03:12.985 --> 01:03:15.852
Where are we goi ng?
Away from here!

01:03:29.068 --> 01:03:30.899
Hey! Hey!

01:03:31.003 --> 01:03:34.962
Hey! Stop!
Stop!
Help! Help!

01:03:35.074 --> 01:03:36.974
Oh!

01:03:38.844 --> 01:03:41.404
what's the matter
with you people? Crazy?

01:03:45.618 --> 01:03:49.554
Fuck this!

01:04:20.753 --> 01:04:23.381
- What are you doing?
- Shut up! Be quiet!

01:05:41.533 --> 01:05:46.197
Get the fuckoutta my cab!

01:06:13.465 --> 01:06:15.626
Thanks, Amy.
Could we have some
more coffee, please?

01:06:15.734 --> 01:06:17.895
Sure.

01:06:18.003 --> 01:06:22.372
This works, huh?
Well, it always has.

01:06:36.588 --> 01:06:38.522
You're right.
I feel better.

01:06:38.624 --> 01:06:41.593
I think I'll need two.

01:06:47.966 --> 01:06:49.866
What are we gonna do?

01:06:49.968 --> 01:06:52.095
Go to the police.

01:07:00.345 --> 01:07:02.245
Thank you.

01:07:04.116 --> 01:07:06.516
And tell them what?

01:07:08.287 --> 01:07:10.881
How would you explain
whatyou were doing
up in Hamid's penthouse?

01:07:10.989 --> 01:07:13.014
I was worried about you.

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:16.526
Some woman who jumps
into your car at the airport?

01:07:16.628 --> 01:07:18.528
That's the truth.

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:21.690
Well, the truth
will put me in jail.

01:07:23.402 --> 01:07:27.566
We should try
to see Jack.
Jack Caper?

01:07:27.673 --> 01:07:30.938
Yes, the one
with the boat.
The one with the wife?

01:07:34.513 --> 01:07:37.141
He's a very rich man.

01:07:39.184 --> 01:07:41.084
I was his mistress.

01:07:49.661 --> 01:07:53.927
I, um, I was modeling
and, uh,

01:07:54.032 --> 01:07:56.592
t-trying to, you know,
make it as an actress.

01:07:56.702 --> 01:07:59.170
Mostly, I hung out a lot.

01:07:59.271 --> 01:08:01.364
I-I metJack at a party.

01:08:01.473 --> 01:08:06.843
we went to Europe together
for fun, and it just
sort of evolved.

01:08:06.945 --> 01:08:11.279
He gave me an apartment
in Westwood, and, um,

01:08:11.383 --> 01:08:14.443
credit cards, my Porsche.

01:08:14.553 --> 01:08:18.182
It was easy. It was nice.

01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:22.590
- How long?
- Five years.

01:08:22.694 --> 01:08:25.662
Five years?
You must have been 16.

01:08:28.066 --> 01:08:30.863
I'm not as young as I look.

01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:35.968
About six months ago,
I get this call from his lawyer.

01:08:36.073 --> 01:08:38.702
I had to move out.
My credit cards were canceled.

01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:40.868
He let me keep the Porsche.

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:44.345
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:08:44.448 --> 01:08:46.974
He won't talk to me.

01:08:52.024 --> 01:08:54.754
What aboutyou?
What do you do?

01:08:56.194 --> 01:09:01.154
I work
for Communtronics.
A recording studio?

01:09:01.265 --> 01:09:04.292
I'm an aerospace engineer.

01:09:04.403 --> 01:09:07.167
Really?
Mm-hmm.

01:09:07.272 --> 01:09:11.970
That sounds fascinating.
Does it really?

01:09:13.845 --> 01:09:15.745
Well, yeah, sort of.

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:20.241
What wereyou doing
at the airport?

01:09:20.352 --> 01:09:25.187
- It's kind ofhard to explain.
- Try me.

01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:28.020
I can't sleep.

01:09:28.126 --> 01:09:30.685
Soyou went to the airport?

01:09:31.796 --> 01:09:33.924
My life isn't working out
somehow.

01:09:34.032 --> 01:09:35.932
Soyou went to the airport?

01:09:38.236 --> 01:09:40.328
My wife is unfaithful to me.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:43.670
Oh. Your wife's
having an affair.

01:09:43.774 --> 01:09:46.767
That makes it sound romantic.

01:09:46.877 --> 01:09:48.346
- Well, maybe it is.
- Thank you.

01:09:48.346 --> 01:09:50.008
- Well, maybe it is.
- Thank you.

01:09:54.486 --> 01:09:57.114
Sorry.

01:10:37.662 --> 01:10:39.562
Well?

01:10:45.504 --> 01:10:48.496
Let's make it
on the beach.
Bud, it's too cold.

01:10:48.607 --> 01:10:50.541
It's cold, my ass.
I'll buy you a new coat.

01:10:50.642 --> 01:10:53.406
Get outta here.

01:10:56.114 --> 01:10:59.413
Hi, Moe. Hi, Larry.
Hi, Curly.

01:10:59.518 --> 01:11:02.214
I thought you were gonna
feed the birds.
You said you'd feed them.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.220
Carlotta was supposed to,
but she's offthis week.

01:11:04.322 --> 01:11:06.290
You've got to feed the birds.
Don't make me
feed the birds.

01:11:06.391 --> 01:11:08.723
I'm afraid of them.
You're afraid of everything.

01:11:08.827 --> 01:11:13.059
They're too loud, Bud.
They're loud
because they're hungry.

01:11:13.165 --> 01:11:15.292
Ooh.
I feel stupid
in this outfit.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.925
You may feel stupid,
but you look sensational.

01:11:18.036 --> 01:11:19.936
Do I have to wear
the dumb sash?

01:11:20.038 --> 01:11:22.598
Oblige me.
I'm gonna put this on video.

01:11:23.942 --> 01:11:26.775
Mmm.
Quiet, Moe!

01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:31.913
It's 7:30 in the morning,
for chrissake.

01:11:42.394 --> 01:11:45.921
Who the hell are you?

01:11:46.031 --> 01:11:48.397
Won't you come in?

01:11:57.109 --> 01:12:00.340
Holy shit.
Charlie?

01:12:23.268 --> 01:12:26.169
Oh, God,
I hope Charlie's all right.

01:12:34.412 --> 01:12:39.349
- Where's my brother?
- Your brother is well.

01:12:39.451 --> 01:12:43.888
- Where is he?
- He's not here. He fled.

01:12:43.989 --> 01:12:46.856
Now, if you'll come
with us.

01:12:46.958 --> 01:12:51.986
- Do we have a choice?
- Very droll. Very amusing.

01:14:10.041 --> 01:14:12.168
Hey, Diane, come here!

01:14:16.248 --> 01:14:20.150
Help! Help!

01:14:26.725 --> 01:14:31.458
We better call the police!

01:14:57.722 --> 01:15:01.123
Colin Morris
was a superb man.

01:15:01.226 --> 01:15:03.820
He told me that
you were also very good.

01:15:03.928 --> 01:15:06.692
Colin Morris?
The Englishman?

01:15:06.798 --> 01:15:09.358
- Yes, the Englishman.
- He worked for you?

01:15:09.467 --> 01:15:12.698
Colin was my employee, yes.

01:15:12.804 --> 01:15:16.535
What was your name, sir?
When I give you the stones,
you will let us go?

01:15:16.641 --> 01:15:22.238
I hardly think so.
I'll need you
to appease Shaheen.

01:15:22.347 --> 01:15:26.113
She'll want blood.
Yours will do.

01:15:47.572 --> 01:15:50.700
if you're not gonna let us go,
why should I help you?

01:15:50.809 --> 01:15:53.710
You're fond of Ed, yes?

01:16:20.772 --> 01:16:23.297
do you have any idea what
theywere looking for?
No!

01:16:23.408 --> 01:16:26.036
You never
saw these guys--
I told you five times!

01:16:26.144 --> 01:16:28.977
I don't know what
they were after!

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.571
Jesus Christ!
Sir, this woman
says she came...

01:16:31.683 --> 01:16:34.379
- to pick up a coat
from Mrs. Herman.
- We're not married!

01:16:34.486 --> 01:16:36.716
Bud, what happened?

01:16:36.821 --> 01:16:39.585
- Where's Christie?
- She's not here. Okay, Diana?

01:16:39.691 --> 01:16:42.387
You a friendofMr. Herman's?

01:16:44.429 --> 01:16:48.627
Uh, what's going on?
I just came here
to pick up my coat.

01:16:48.733 --> 01:16:54.569
- What coat?
- My, uh, my big down coat.

01:16:54.672 --> 01:16:58.369
I loaned it to Christie.
She told me to pick it up today.

01:17:02.914 --> 01:17:05.883
- There it is over there.
- Will you get her out of here?

01:17:05.984 --> 01:17:08.384
Wait a second.

01:17:13.858 --> 01:17:17.589
What the fuck are you clowns
gonna do about this?

01:17:24.702 --> 01:17:26.727
- Bud--
- Good-bye, Diana.

01:17:29.107 --> 01:17:32.941
All right, Mr. Herman,
we know you're on probation
for possession of cocaine.

01:17:33.044 --> 01:17:36.502
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
do you know what they were
looking for?

01:17:36.614 --> 01:17:38.707
I don't fuckin'
believe this.

01:17:38.817 --> 01:17:42.048
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to get some information from you
before I can let you go.

01:17:42.153 --> 01:17:44.553
Oh, sure.

01:17:48.693 --> 01:17:50.593
Would you just walk me
to my car?

01:18:06.377 --> 01:18:11.872
Sean,Jeff, come on,
get out ofthe car.

01:18:14.686 --> 01:18:17.917
These men work for me.

01:18:18.022 --> 01:18:19.922
Ed.

01:18:20.024 --> 01:18:23.255
Uh, Pierre,
come on out
and meet Sheriff--

01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:25.989
Peterson.
Sheriff Peterson.

01:18:34.539 --> 01:18:37.906
Sheriff Peterson,
this is my husband, Ed.

01:18:38.009 --> 01:18:40.341
And this is our
good friend, Pierre,
from Paris.

01:18:40.445 --> 01:18:42.413
Can't tell you
how pleased I am
to meet you.

01:18:42.514 --> 01:18:44.414
I--
Pierre doesn't
speak English.

01:18:44.516 --> 01:18:46.507
He's such a good cook
though, who cares?

01:18:46.618 --> 01:18:48.677
well, it's nice
to meet you all.

01:18:48.786 --> 01:18:50.913
if you'll just--
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:18:51.022 --> 01:18:54.651
Um, my name
is Mrs. Ed O-O-- C-Cohen.

01:18:54.759 --> 01:18:57.159
Uh, C-o-h-e-n.

01:18:57.262 --> 01:19:02.495
Um, I live at 1234
Malibu Canyon Road.

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.161
Malibu, California.

01:19:06.271 --> 01:19:09.707
And our number
is 456-2199.

01:19:09.707 --> 01:19:11.766
And our number
is 456-2199.

01:19:11.876 --> 01:19:16.336
That's fine. we'll, uh,
most likely be in touch with you
within the next two days or so.

01:19:16.447 --> 01:19:20.042
Oh, look at the time! Honey,
we're going to be really late!
Oh, you're right.

01:19:21.519 --> 01:19:24.283
It was nice
meeting you, Sheriff.
Thank you so much.

01:19:27.926 --> 01:19:31.191
Uh, Sean,Jeff,

01:19:31.296 --> 01:19:33.264
could you walk Pierre over
to the Roberts' house?

01:19:33.364 --> 01:19:36.458
We're so late as it is,
and it's only a block from here.

01:19:36.568 --> 01:19:41.005
See you later, Pierre.
Bye, Sheriff.

01:19:47.278 --> 01:19:49.576
So, uh, are you having...

01:19:49.681 --> 01:19:53.845
a nice time in America?

01:20:29.253 --> 01:20:32.279
I know it's here somewhere.
"Somewhere"?

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:36.451
Yeah, I had to use it once.
I ruined a silk blouse.

01:20:36.561 --> 01:20:39.029
Must have been awful
for you.

01:20:41.699 --> 01:20:43.599
There it is.

01:21:00.051 --> 01:21:02.611
The only thing
I can't handle is snakes.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.086
At this point, a snake
would be reassuring.

01:21:09.661 --> 01:21:11.959
Now what?

01:21:12.063 --> 01:21:15.760
Well-- Well...

01:21:15.867 --> 01:21:19.997
the grounds are crawlin'
with servants during
the day.

01:21:20.104 --> 01:21:22.004
We wait here till dark.

01:21:22.106 --> 01:21:24.734
You're kidding.
It's only noon.

01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:28.110
Mmm.

01:21:30.214 --> 01:21:32.341
Ah.

01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:34.350
Try to rest.
Get some sleep.

01:21:34.452 --> 01:21:36.477
Sleep here?
Diana--

01:21:36.587 --> 01:21:38.919
I'm gonna try
to grab a nap.

01:21:39.023 --> 01:21:41.184
Diana?

01:22:01.979 --> 01:22:04.311
You scared the shit outta me.
It's dark.

01:22:04.415 --> 01:22:07.680
I've been watching you
sleep for nine hours.
Can we go now?

01:22:07.785 --> 01:22:10.811
Oh, boy,
I really conked out.
Yes, you did.

01:22:10.922 --> 01:22:12.822
Mmm.

01:22:17.228 --> 01:22:20.391
This thing's locked.
No, it comes off.

01:22:20.498 --> 01:22:23.194
Maybe it did once.

01:22:26.637 --> 01:22:28.537
You must be stronger
than you look.

01:23:41.212 --> 01:23:43.112
Jack?

01:23:48.519 --> 01:23:54.151
What's happened to you?
They say my blood's
gone bad on me.

01:23:54.258 --> 01:23:57.523
I'm buying it by the case
like champagne.

01:23:59.697 --> 01:24:02.393
Are you, uh, in pain or--

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.900
I can't even get
any interesting drugs.

01:24:07.371 --> 01:24:09.771
It's good to see you, Peach.

01:24:09.874 --> 01:24:15.176
I couldn't figure out
what Joan was doing here.
I had no idea.

01:24:15.279 --> 01:24:18.942
After years of compulsive
spending, she's finally...

01:24:19.050 --> 01:24:21.348
taking an interest
in estate planning.

01:24:25.056 --> 01:24:28.116
Did she tell you I called?
When?

01:24:28.226 --> 01:24:30.956
When?

01:24:32.797 --> 01:24:35.163
Jack, I've been trying
to get ahold of you
for six months.

01:24:35.266 --> 01:24:37.791
It's Joan.

01:24:37.902 --> 01:24:41.201
That bitch.
She's very thorough.

01:24:43.774 --> 01:24:45.674
Who's this?

01:24:45.776 --> 01:24:50.213
Oh, um, Ed Okin.

01:24:50.314 --> 01:24:54.648
I got myself into trouble,
and he's the only one I've
been able to count on.

01:24:56.454 --> 01:24:59.514
- What is this?
- It's an orgy.

01:25:04.262 --> 01:25:06.662
You're trespassing.
Get them out.

01:25:06.764 --> 01:25:10.461
If they won't leave,
call the police!
Larry, disregard that.

01:25:14.572 --> 01:25:18.406
- You are endangering his life!
- Get her out, Larry.

01:25:21.846 --> 01:25:25.077
Whoeveryou are,
or thinkyou are,

01:25:25.182 --> 01:25:27.810
there have been a dozen
just like you.

01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:41.723
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to come here.

01:25:41.832 --> 01:25:43.959
You better hurry
and tell me the problem.

01:25:48.739 --> 01:25:50.934
Hasi's dead.
Hasi's dead?

01:25:51.042 --> 01:25:53.510
Yeah.
Hamid too.
How?

01:25:53.611 --> 01:25:56.842
Hasi sent me to Zurich
to get some stones
out of a safety box.

01:25:56.948 --> 01:25:58.848
Theywere left
to him and--

01:25:58.950 --> 01:26:03.512
He needed money in a hurry,
and he used you to get 'em
into the country.

01:26:03.621 --> 01:26:06.556
That little shit.
People have been trying
to kill me too.

01:26:06.657 --> 01:26:11.492
Yeah, Larry told me
about the men in the boat.
Must be Shaheen.

01:26:12.596 --> 01:26:15.360
Hasi's aunt?
Did you ever meet her?

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.568
Hard as nails.

01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:21.536
She's got a deal
in escrow.

01:26:21.639 --> 01:26:23.766
Major development
downtown.

01:26:23.874 --> 01:26:27.935
Escrow closes in a week,
and she's gotta come up
with a bundle.

01:26:28.045 --> 01:26:30.946
She called me
for a short-term loan,
a big one,

01:26:31.048 --> 01:26:34.313
but, uh,
I didn't need the headache.

01:26:34.418 --> 01:26:37.615
She mentioned that she might
take Hasi in as a partner,

01:26:37.722 --> 01:26:41.089
if he could
raise enough cash.

01:26:41.192 --> 01:26:43.160
She had to know
about the stones.

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:46.491
Wait a minute. This is all
about a real estate deal?

01:26:46.597 --> 01:26:49.998
- She can have them.
I'll keep my mouth shut.
- A real estate deal?

01:26:50.101 --> 01:26:52.763
Honey, you know enough
to get 'em locked up
or deported.

01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:56.567
My wife sells real estate.
Not to mention blackmail
and murder.

01:26:56.674 --> 01:26:58.733
It's not just the stones
anymore.

01:27:00.678 --> 01:27:04.478
You're gonna have
to negotiate with Shaheen.
Negotiate?

01:27:04.582 --> 01:27:08.177
Offer to sell her the stones.
She'll understand that.

01:27:09.487 --> 01:27:11.853
- What about the Frenchman?
- What Frenchman?

01:27:11.956 --> 01:27:14.254
Someone else who wants to kill us.

01:27:14.358 --> 01:27:18.089
Well, whoever he is,
he can't possibly be
as dangerous as Shaheen.

01:27:18.195 --> 01:27:23.223
- What do we do?
- Go around by my office.
The number's on the Rolodex.

01:27:23.334 --> 01:27:26.167
- Shaheen Parvizi.
- Parvizi, right.

01:27:31.475 --> 01:27:33.705
I'll just
wait outside.
Okay.

01:27:39.450 --> 01:27:42.385
You get out of the country
and start again.

01:27:42.486 --> 01:27:46.422
This'll probably be
the best thing that ever
happened to you, Peach.

01:27:48.492 --> 01:27:52.087
I thought you hated me.

01:28:01.605 --> 01:28:05.564
Bye. I'll miss you.

01:28:05.676 --> 01:28:08.509
Take care, Peach.
I will.

01:28:11.882 --> 01:28:14.715
Can we borrow a car?

01:28:18.489 --> 01:28:21.424
Mr. Caper said
take any car you want.

01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:26.627
This is nice.
The keys
are inside.

01:28:35.673 --> 01:28:38.005
Be careful, huh?

01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:41.670
See you at the airport.
Okay.

01:28:50.621 --> 01:28:52.919
Banzai.

01:29:03.667 --> 01:29:07.728
You've gotta go.
Mrs. Caper is really
pissed off.

01:29:11.942 --> 01:29:14.706
Which one
is Mrs. Caper's car?

01:29:52.483 --> 01:29:54.383
I'm not armed.

01:30:01.959 --> 01:30:04.860
Those are not
for you.

01:30:04.962 --> 01:30:07.430
Are they for me?

01:30:55.446 --> 01:30:59.314
But only three.
For good faith.

01:30:59.416 --> 01:31:02.715
- Whose good faith?
- Yours and mine.

01:31:04.922 --> 01:31:09.382
- Where are the other three?
- Diana's hiding them as we speak.

01:31:09.493 --> 01:31:14.430
- Where?
- I don't know.
- I should believe that?

01:31:30.447 --> 01:31:34.406
Can I help you?

01:31:34.518 --> 01:31:37.817
Wherever they are right now,
it'll be somewhere where they
can be discovered by anyone...

01:31:37.921 --> 01:31:40.185
or destroyed,
so we don't have much time.

01:31:41.725 --> 01:31:44.785
do you have the money?

01:31:46.897 --> 01:31:50.628
At this bulk, Miss Bailey,
I can give you
a very good price.

01:31:50.734 --> 01:31:54.261
Whatever it costs.
You only get married once.

01:31:54.371 --> 01:31:59.035
Only when she's sure
about her safety, she'll call.

01:31:59.143 --> 01:32:02.408
She'll tell you where they
can be found. You'll never
hear from her again.

01:32:02.513 --> 01:32:06.142
Then you wait for the call
with me as long as it takes.

01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:10.277
No, she makes the call
when we're reunited,
when I'm safe too.

01:32:10.387 --> 01:32:13.948
You expect me to believe
you won't take the other half?

01:32:14.058 --> 01:32:16.253
Good faith.
We could've taken them all.

01:32:17.628 --> 01:32:20.153
How do you know she
has not already run away,

01:32:20.264 --> 01:32:22.789
Ieft you behind with me?

01:32:26.303 --> 01:32:29.739
I don't. It's a risk
we'll both have to take.

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.799
This girl goes with anyone
who takes care ofher.

01:32:33.911 --> 01:32:36.436
She gives herself away
like a fool.

01:32:36.547 --> 01:32:41.678
She has nothing ofher own,
only what's given
or what she takes.

01:32:41.785 --> 01:32:44.447
This is a foolish risk.

01:32:44.555 --> 01:32:48.582
Right now
there's really no choice.

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:52.060
for you maybe.

01:32:57.901 --> 01:32:59.801
Aren't they beautiful?

01:32:59.903 --> 01:33:02.963
Oh, yes. Gorgeous.

01:33:04.441 --> 01:33:07.535
Mrs. Parvizi will be by
to pick them up in a few hours.

01:33:07.644 --> 01:33:11.011
All she wants is the money
and no more trouble.

01:33:11.115 --> 01:33:13.310
- Who are you?
- That's all she wants.

01:33:13.417 --> 01:33:15.681
Just what was promised her
and her safety.

01:33:15.786 --> 01:33:19.222
- What about you?
- I'm just a friend.

01:33:19.323 --> 01:33:22.156
A friend?
Of Jack Caper's too?

01:33:22.259 --> 01:33:25.456
You drive his car.
What do you want?

01:33:25.562 --> 01:33:28.998
She said she'd split
the money with me.

01:33:29.099 --> 01:33:33.331
All this risk for $ 12,500?

01:33:33.437 --> 01:33:36.304
No. Please.

01:33:36.407 --> 01:33:39.672
- No, of course not.
- Then why?

01:33:39.777 --> 01:33:43.679
The last thing you'd believe
is anything close to the truth.

01:33:43.781 --> 01:33:48.775
The truth is...
I'm not sure I know.

01:33:48.886 --> 01:33:53.323
Somebody had to help her.
I happened to be in the wrong place
at the right time.

01:33:53.424 --> 01:33:57.451
- How much did Melville offer?
- The French guy?
we rejected his offer.

01:33:57.561 --> 01:34:01.258
Twenty-five thousand
dollars is nothing.
I do not understand.

01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:06.802
Okay, you give me
the money in cash.

01:34:06.904 --> 01:34:10.465
when I see Diana, we 'll call
and tellyou the location
ofthe other three stones.

01:34:10.574 --> 01:34:12.439
It's simple.
Too simple.

01:34:12.543 --> 01:34:14.443
why? what is it?
what's wrong with our plan?

01:34:14.545 --> 01:34:17.981
There has to be a catch,
a trick.

01:34:18.081 --> 01:34:20.379
I do not trust your plan.

01:34:20.484 --> 01:34:22.645
I think it's a very good plan.

01:34:22.753 --> 01:34:25.085
Come on. Time's running out.
Escrow is closing.

01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:28.488
- Did Jack Caper tell you that?
- Yes, that's right.

01:34:28.592 --> 01:34:30.685
- I'm Jack's son.
- His son?

01:34:30.794 --> 01:34:33.160
Illegitimate.
But some day it'll all be mine.

01:34:33.263 --> 01:34:35.697
You and I might be doing
business, going out to lunch.

01:34:37.234 --> 01:34:41.330
All right, okay, fine.
I'll tell you the truth.

01:34:41.438 --> 01:34:45.670
Diana's C.I.A. I'm on
Her Majesty's Secret Service.
We've got the place surrounded.

01:34:50.247 --> 01:34:53.774
I'm really from Immigration.

01:34:53.884 --> 01:34:56.250
We thought you might have some
illegal aliens working here.

01:34:56.353 --> 01:35:00.119
- What are you playing at?
- I apologize. I've been lying.

01:35:00.224 --> 01:35:02.454
I'm actually
the chairman ofthe committee
to reelect the president.

01:35:02.559 --> 01:35:05.790
- I was hoping for
a substantial contribution.
- You are mad.

01:35:05.896 --> 01:35:08.126
Nowyou don't know
what to believe, do you?

01:35:08.232 --> 01:35:12.293
Look, either you've
already lost everything...

01:35:12.402 --> 01:35:15.963
or you have to take
a chance on me.

01:35:16.073 --> 01:35:18.667
Neither of us
have much to lose.

01:35:35.292 --> 01:35:39.353
If he's still there, you better
let him go if you ever want
to see those stones alive.

01:35:39.463 --> 01:35:41.363
A-Again.

01:35:41.465 --> 01:35:43.365
Ever.

01:36:15.399 --> 01:36:19.233
I promise if I'm followed,
I'll go straight to the police.

01:36:19.336 --> 01:36:23.295
Besides, it might
take every one of you
to retrieve the stones.

01:36:23.407 --> 01:36:25.500
They could be scattered
all over the city.

01:36:25.609 --> 01:36:29.306
- When can we expect this call?
- When everyone's safe.

01:36:53.704 --> 01:36:55.604
Mr. Oskovitz.

01:36:55.706 --> 01:37:00.973
Mr. Frank Oskovitz, please go
to the white courtesy telephone.

01:37:01.078 --> 01:37:04.912
One minute, sir.
One minute.

01:37:07.618 --> 01:37:13.250
Aero Norte
Flight 1 56 to Mexico City
now boarding at Gate 53.

01:38:22.826 --> 01:38:25.420
Boo.
Great.

01:38:25.529 --> 01:38:28.555
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
We'll miss the plane.

01:38:31.702 --> 01:38:33.727
I have to make the call.
Fuck 'em.
We'll do it from Mexico.

01:38:33.837 --> 01:38:35.998
No, no, no, no.
It has to be done now.
I want it overwith.

01:38:36.106 --> 01:38:39.507
You're crazy.
The flower market downtown.

01:38:39.609 --> 01:38:42.476
Yakamura Roses.
It's waiting for you.
It's in your name.

01:38:42.579 --> 01:38:44.479
Wait! Wait!

01:39:11.942 --> 01:39:14.809
Your atencio'n, por favor.

01:39:20.884 --> 01:39:25.378
Ladies and gentlemen,
mechanical difficulties
necessitate our asking...

01:39:25.489 --> 01:39:28.424
all passengers
to kindly deplane...

01:39:28.525 --> 01:39:31.722
and return temporarily
to the boarding area.

01:39:31.828 --> 01:39:34.296
Thank you for your cooperation,
and our apologies for the delay.

01:39:51.748 --> 01:39:54.808
I 'm afraid all passengers
have to get off the aircraft
at this time.

01:39:54.918 --> 01:39:58.615
You think we could wait it out
in here? It's more comfortable
than out there.

01:39:58.722 --> 01:40:00.917
I'm very sorry, sir.
Rules are rules.

01:40:10.967 --> 01:40:13.902
...please go to a white
courtesy telephone.

01:40:14.004 --> 01:40:19.271
Miss Susan Dorgan,
please meet your party
at baggage area--

01:40:26.216 --> 01:40:28.707
Look.

01:40:31.922 --> 01:40:34.390
Now what happens?

01:40:52.409 --> 01:40:54.468
- What the fuck--
- Federal Agent!
Everybody down!

01:41:46.463 --> 01:41:48.761
This is ridiculous.

01:41:59.843 --> 01:42:02.869
Big shot, huh?
You got a gun. Now what?

01:42:08.418 --> 01:42:10.943
Shithead. You.

01:42:12.389 --> 01:42:15.552
Huh?

01:42:19.729 --> 01:42:23.062
Maniac.

01:42:36.379 --> 01:42:40.816
Let me askyou something.
Maybe you can help me.

01:42:42.285 --> 01:42:44.515
What's wrong with my life?

01:42:46.423 --> 01:42:50.382
Why is my wife sleeping
with someone else?

01:42:55.432 --> 01:42:57.832
Why can't I sleep?

01:43:50.453 --> 01:43:52.421
What are you doing?

01:44:12.142 --> 01:44:15.043
Will somebody tell me
what we're doing here?

01:44:24.487 --> 01:44:26.717
Well, at least
we're not dead.

01:44:26.823 --> 01:44:29.724
Maybe we are,
we just don't know it.

01:44:31.361 --> 01:44:35.058
When you die, you don't
go to a Ramada Inn.
How do you know?

01:44:40.804 --> 01:44:44.763
And, uh,
what's happening here?

01:44:44.874 --> 01:44:47.775
Sorry, Mrs. Parvizi,
but you'll have to come with us.

01:44:56.286 --> 01:44:59.778
Can we see you in here
for a minute, please?

01:45:11.101 --> 01:45:16.334
- Are we under arrest or what?
- I'd say you'd fall into
the "or what" category.

01:45:16.439 --> 01:45:20.637
- Are you a policeman?
- I'm a federal agent.
Feel better?

01:45:22.078 --> 01:45:24.046
will you gentlemen
excuse us, please?

01:45:53.309 --> 01:45:56.506
I don't know
what's going down here,
and I don't want to know.

01:45:56.613 --> 01:46:00.674
All I know is that this money's
clean, and I'm supposed
to give it to you.

01:46:00.783 --> 01:46:04.014
- For what?
- Someone--

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:08.318
- Someone very important
must like you.
-Jack.

01:46:08.424 --> 01:46:13.794
There's $750,000 right there.

01:46:16.132 --> 01:46:19.158
All this money is for us?

01:46:29.179 --> 01:46:31.204
Who you gonna tell?

01:46:33.983 --> 01:46:38.716
You got 24 hours undisturbed.
You're not to leave this room.

01:46:38.821 --> 01:46:42.222
After that, you're on your own.

01:46:49.032 --> 01:46:54.402
