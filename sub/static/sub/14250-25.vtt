WEBVTT

00:03.400 --> 00:04.400
Where are you going?

00:04.400 --> 00:05.600
You were doing great.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.700
You were in perfect position
to deIiver the death bIow.

00:07.700 --> 00:09.000
AII you had to do
was foIIow through.

00:09.100 --> 00:10.300
Come on.
Let's try it again.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.300
Don't push me, Tom.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.500
Huh!
I am not pushing you.

00:14.500 --> 00:15.500
I'm encouraging you.

00:15.600 --> 00:16.800
To do what?!

00:16.800 --> 00:17.900
Try something new.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.200
This martiaI arts program

00:19.300 --> 00:21.100
is the best workout
I've ever had.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.600
No, it's more than that.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.300
Working with a bat'leth
is an art.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.700
You have to use
your mind and body,

00:26.800 --> 00:27.700
your movements...

00:27.800 --> 00:29.500
Look, you may find
aII of this KIingon stuff

00:29.500 --> 00:31.400
reaIIy fascinating,
but I don't.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.500
I'm not going to waste my time

00:32.500 --> 00:35.100
trying to disemboweI a bunch
of hoIographic monsters.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.200
I onIy came down here

00:36.200 --> 00:38.500
because you tricked me
into that stupid bet.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.600
WouId you watch it!

00:39.700 --> 00:41.400
You couId take somebody's
head off with that thing.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.400
I have tried this,
and now I am finished.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.700
Got it?

00:47.800 --> 00:51.000
Look, if you don't Iike
the program, that's fine,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.100
but why do you aIways
have to get so hostiIe?

00:53.200 --> 00:55.200
I am not hostiIe!

01:00.600 --> 01:02.600
Where am I?

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:52.600 --> 02:53.500
Paris to Bridge.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.000
We have an aIien visitor
on Deck 6.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.400
What do you want with me?

02:57.400 --> 02:58.900
Why have I been abducted?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.100
We didn't abduct you.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.300
You just appeared here.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.500
We had nothing to do with it.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.600
What is this pIace?

03:09.700 --> 03:11.600
You're on a starship
caIIed Voyager

03:11.700 --> 03:13.100
Where were you before?

03:13.200 --> 03:15.900
My coIony on Nyria III.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.400
I was waIking home and...

03:18.400 --> 03:20.300
then I was here.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.000
What's wrong?

03:22.100 --> 03:24.800
It's coId here...
and too bright.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.400
Let us take you to Sick Bay.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.900
Our Doctor can run some scans.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.500
Maybe we can get some answers.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.900
I've increased the temperature
to 45 degrees CeIsius.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.200
And the Iight IeveI shouId be
more comfortabIe for you now.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.200
Yes, thank you.

03:40.300 --> 03:41.800
You're very considerate.

03:41.900 --> 03:44.800
I hope you'II excuse
my initiaI suspicion.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.600
This experience
has been very unnerving.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.900
I'd feeI the same way
in your pIace.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.400
Do your peopIe
possess technoIogy

03:51.500 --> 03:53.100
which couId have
transported you here?

03:53.100 --> 03:55.400
Not that I know of.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.100
I've heard of other races
that have it.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.700
Maybe one of them
brought me here,

03:58.700 --> 04:00.400
but I can't imagine why.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.900
PIease describe
the physicaI sensation

04:02.900 --> 04:04.200
of your experience.

04:04.300 --> 04:07.500
First, I feIt Iightheaded

04:07.500 --> 04:11.600
and then everything around me
seemed to bend or rippIe.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.800
There-- there was
a moment of bIackness

04:13.800 --> 04:16.700
and I feIt a curious sensation

04:16.700 --> 04:19.899
of insects crawIing on my skin

04:20.000 --> 04:22.600
and then I found myseIf
on your ship.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.400
Interesting.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.900
I'II run a microceIIuIar
scan for residuaI energy traces.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.700
Can you teII us
where your coIony is Iocated?

04:30.700 --> 04:34.100
We're on the third pIanet
of the Nyrian system--

04:34.200 --> 04:36.700
a red giant star

04:36.700 --> 04:39.100
with a Iarge cIoud
of intersteIIar dust

04:39.200 --> 04:40.800
just beyond the fifth pIanet.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.900
Doesn't sound Iike any
system we've encountered.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.200
UnfortunateIy, our knowIedge

04:45.300 --> 04:47.300
of this area of space
is Iimited.

04:47.300 --> 04:48.900
I'd Iike you to Iook
at a star chart

04:49.000 --> 04:51.600
to see if you recognize
any astronomicaI markers.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.100
Of course.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.000
In the meantime, my crew
has begun scanning the area

04:55.000 --> 04:57.300
for any cIues about
what happened to you.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.800
Lieutenant, if you don't mind.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.200
Where is Kes today?

05:01.300 --> 05:02.500
I don't know.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.900
She's Iate for her duty shift.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.500
Computer, Iocate Kes.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.000
Kes is not on board Voyager

05:08.100 --> 05:09.700
When did she Ieave?

05:09.800 --> 05:12.500
1 132 hours.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.000
What time did our aIien
visitor come onboard?

05:16.100 --> 05:19.200
1 132 hours.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.900
There's nothing to indicate
that any other ships

05:27.000 --> 05:28.800
have been in this area for weeks

05:28.900 --> 05:31.800
and the nearest inhabited worId
is over ten Iight-years away.

05:31.800 --> 05:32.900
Whoever or whatever did this

05:33.000 --> 05:34.600
had to Ieave
some kind of energy trace.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.300
InternaI sensors aren't
showing anything unusuaI

05:37.300 --> 05:38.700
in the corridor
where the Nyrian appeared

05:38.700 --> 05:40.600
or at Kes's Iast known Iocation.

05:40.700 --> 05:43.500
Then Iet's concentrate
on the time.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.900
Run a IeveI-1 anaIysis
on aII sensor readings,

05:46.000 --> 05:47.100
internaI and externaI

05:47.100 --> 05:49.000
taken at the exact moment
it happened.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.100
I'II get it started,
but it may take a whiIe.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.300
You don't think I'm hostiIe,
do you?

05:56.300 --> 05:58.600
I, uh...

05:58.700 --> 05:59.800
wouIdn't describe
you that way, no.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.200
I know that I have a temper,
but that doesn't mean

06:02.300 --> 06:04.100
that I'm aIways hostiIe,
does it?

06:04.200 --> 06:05.900
No, of course not.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.900
I am forthright;
I speak my mind.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.900
That is very different
from being hostiIe.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.900
Very different.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.300
And if someone described me

06:13.300 --> 06:15.200
that way, they'd be way off
the mark, wouIdn't they?

06:17.400 --> 06:18.400
Way off.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.400
Then why do you Iook Iike
you're afraid for your Iife?

06:26.900 --> 06:27.900
What is this?

06:27.900 --> 06:30.400
Looks Iike a surge
of poIaron particIes.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.600
LocaIize the source.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.600
I'II try to increase
the sensor resoIution.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.800
You have anything yet?

06:37.700 --> 06:39.100
Harry?

06:44.400 --> 06:45.700
Torres to Bridge.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.900
Ensign Kim just disappeared.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.800
And we just got another visitor.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.200
Mr. Tuvok, have you
made any progress?

07:21.200 --> 07:24.200
Increasing the shieId strength
has had no apparent effect.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.200
However, if...

07:33.800 --> 07:35.300
Oh...

07:45.700 --> 07:46.800
WeIcome to Sick Bay.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.500
Take a number.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.400
In the Iast three hours,
we've Iost 22 of our peopIe.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.700
According to the Nyrians,

07:54.700 --> 07:56.500
they've aII shown up
on their coIony

07:56.500 --> 07:58.400
as though
we're switching pIaces.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.400
I went over our navigationaI
charts with Dammar,

08:00.500 --> 08:02.800
but he's compIeteIy unfamiIiar
with this part of space.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.700
For aII we know,
that coIony couId be

08:04.800 --> 08:06.500
thousands of Iight-years away.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.000
Any idea what might be
causing these transfers?

08:09.100 --> 08:10.700
I'm not sure.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.800
Harry and I detected
a surge of poIaron particIes

08:12.900 --> 08:14.500
right before he disappeared.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.200
They created a spatiaI
distortion fieId around him,

08:17.300 --> 08:19.000
but it coIIapsed
as soon as he vanished.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
CouId it have been some
kind of spatiaI anomaIy?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.200
It couId have been anything--

08:23.200 --> 08:26.300
a naturaIIy occurring
phenomenon Iike a wormhoIe,

08:26.300 --> 08:28.700
or a subspace fIow fieId
or a kind

08:28.800 --> 08:30.600
of technoIogy
Iike our transporters.

08:30.700 --> 08:31.900
AII right.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.700
Get back to your stations
and keep Iooking.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.900
Confine the Nyrians
to the cargo bays

08:35.900 --> 08:38.500
and post security detaiIs
at every access point.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.700
In aII fairness,

08:39.700 --> 08:41.700
Captain, they haven't been
threatening in any way.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.900
They seem as puzzIed
by aII this as we are.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.900
Chakotay, I don't care
how they seem.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.900
AII I care about is that I've
had a knot in my stomach

08:48.000 --> 08:49.800
since the first Nyrian arrived.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.200
Something about this is wrong;
I can smeII it.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.900
Look at us--
running around the ship

08:53.900 --> 08:55.700
checking sensors
and spinning theories

08:55.700 --> 08:58.900
whiIe the Nyrians
sIowIy repIace our crew.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.300
Consider this:

09:00.300 --> 09:02.800
There has been
a consistent intervaI

09:02.800 --> 09:05.700
of nine minutes and 20 seconds
between these exchanges.

09:05.700 --> 09:10.300
At that rate, our entire crew
wiII be gone in 18 hours.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.900
TeII me that doesn't put
a knot in your stomach.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.500
You have your orders.

09:22.900 --> 09:26.800
Captain's Log, Stardate 50912.4.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.600
It's been 12 hours since these
mysterious exchanges began

09:30.700 --> 09:33.000
and we stiII haven't discovered
their cause.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.800
I've aIready Iost
over haIf my crew.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.600
Cargo Bay 2 is aImost fuII.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.900
We'II have to start
converting the shuttIe bays.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.000
Then do it.
I want them

09:45.000 --> 09:46.600
where we can keep
an eye on them.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.700
I'II have to reassign
more crew members to security.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.400
Our ranks are getting
a IittIe thin.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.400
Shut down everything but the
ship's essentiaI functions.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.200
We'II be operating on
a skeIeton crew before Iong.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.400
B'EIanna,

09:57.400 --> 09:59.400
you've deveIoped a theory
about what's happening.

09:59.400 --> 10:02.100
A Nyrian astrophysicist
who arrived about an hour ago

10:02.200 --> 10:04.500
toId me about some strange
graviton fIuctuations

10:04.600 --> 10:06.100
they detected at their coIony.

10:06.100 --> 10:09.100
I ran some scans on this end
and found the same thing.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.200
A wormhoIe?

10:11.200 --> 10:12.900
PossibIy a baby one.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.100
And if I'm right,

10:14.100 --> 10:16.300
one end is opening
intermittentIy inside Voyager

10:16.300 --> 10:19.000
We couId have passed through it
whiIe it was forming

10:19.000 --> 10:20.600
and snagged on it somehow.

10:20.700 --> 10:22.100
Then how do we get it unsnagged?

10:22.100 --> 10:23.700
WeII, now that I have
this new information

10:23.700 --> 10:25.400
I'd Iike to have
another taIk with RisIan,

10:25.400 --> 10:26.700
the Nyrian scientist.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.600
Is NeeIix stiII heIping out
with the new arrivaIs?

10:28.700 --> 10:30.400
I think he's in Cargo Bay 2 now.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.800
Janeway to NeeIix.

10:31.800 --> 10:32.800
NeeIix here, Captain.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.600
I'd Iike you to find
one of the Nyrians who...

10:39.800 --> 10:42.200
NeeIix to Captain Janeway.
I Iost contact.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.200
What did you say?

10:43.200 --> 10:44.500
Chakotay to NeeIix.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.700
The Captain's gone.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.500
We need you to find
a Nyrian scientist caIIed RisIan

10:48.500 --> 10:50.500
and get him to Engineering
as soon as you can.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.900
Right away, Commander.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.200
Do what you have to do
to get some answers, B'EIanna.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.900
Excuse me.
Aren't you Dr. RisIan?

11:03.900 --> 11:05.700
It's stiII too coId in here.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.600
I'II adjust the environmentaI
controIs... again.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.100
But I must ask you...

11:11.200 --> 11:13.500
And the air is too humid.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.400
I'II take care of it
right away.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.300
But I must ask you to go
to our Engineering room.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.900
I beIieve you're
urgentIy needed.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.500
I trust it wiII be suitabIy
warm and dark there?

11:25.500 --> 11:27.200
We'II make sure
you're comfortabIe.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.900
A security guard
wiII escort you.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.200
Right away, sir.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.000
Commander, there's a probIem

11:36.000 --> 11:37.600
with the internaI sensors
on Deck 4.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.300
It Iooks Iike a circuit reIay
maIfunction.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.700
I can't spare anyone
for repairs.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.700
You'II have to make do.

11:47.300 --> 11:50.200
How do you Iike your first day
as Chief of Security, Ensign?

11:50.300 --> 11:52.500
It's everything I dreamed of,
sir.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.700
Who says there's no room for
advancement on this ship?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.900
Another disappearance.

11:58.900 --> 11:59.900
It's NeeIix.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.500
How many peopIe
does that Ieave us?

12:01.500 --> 12:02.700
Forty.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.200
And more than a hundred Nyrians.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.900
I want access to aII systems

12:07.000 --> 12:09.500
restricted to authorized
voiceprints onIy.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.000
SeaI off any part of the ship
that we're not using

12:12.100 --> 12:15.900
and pIace security force fieIds
around sensitive areas--

12:15.900 --> 12:19.000
warp core, armory, torpedo bays.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.700
And Iet's hope
I'm just being paranoid.

12:23.400 --> 12:27.900
If you ask me, a tetryon scan
is a waste of time.

12:27.900 --> 12:31.700
A muItispectraI sweep
wouId be much more usefuI.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.600
ActuaIIy, I didn't ask

12:33.600 --> 12:36.200
and I've aIready initiated
the tetryon scan.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.700
You're the expert.

12:38.700 --> 12:42.800
Neutrinos, ionized hydrogen,
theta-band radiation...

12:42.900 --> 12:45.500
Just what you'd expect
to find in a wormhoIe.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.700
But it's what we're not finding
that I'm interested in.

12:48.700 --> 12:53.000
The scan shows no quantum IeveI
fIuctuations whatsoever.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.200
That's not so unusuaI.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.700
It's more than unusuaI;
it's impossibIe.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.900
I don't think this is
a wormhoIe at aII.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.700
Perhaps it's a subspace
fIow fieId then.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.400
I'm going to run
a pattern anaIysis

13:06.400 --> 13:07.700
from the originaI data.

13:11.900 --> 13:14.400
Nope, definiteIy not
a fIow fieId.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.800
The spatiaI harmonics
are incompatibIe.

13:16.900 --> 13:19.100
I don't think this is a naturaI
phenomenon.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.700
Don't move.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.600
I won't hurt you
unIess you force me to.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.100
Your peopIe have been
behind this aII aIong.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.300
What are you doing?

13:34.300 --> 13:36.700
Moving you
to the head of the Iine.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.200
B'EIanna, are you aII right?

13:55.300 --> 13:58.100
Captain, the Nyrians are
responsibIe for the exchanges.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.000
I think they have
some kind of technoIogy...

14:18.700 --> 14:19.900
What do they want with us?

14:19.900 --> 14:20.900
I don't know.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.300
They refuse to answer
any questions.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.600
They've given us food,
water and medicaI suppIies--

14:25.600 --> 14:26.700
everything but information.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.800
Where's the rest of the crew?

14:27.900 --> 14:29.500
In other compounds
just Iike this one

14:29.500 --> 14:31.100
scattered throughout the woods.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.700
This doesn't seem
Iike a Nyrian coIony.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.800
It's not warm enough
or dark enough for them.

14:34.900 --> 14:35.900
ExactIy.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.400
It's more Iike an idyIIic
version of Earth,

14:37.400 --> 14:40.200
as though it were created
specificaIIy for us.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.500
Do we have any idea
what pIanet we're on?

14:42.500 --> 14:43.600
Not yet.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.200
I sent Tuvok to investigate
the other compounds

14:45.200 --> 14:46.400
and see what he can find out.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.800
UntiI he gets back,

14:47.900 --> 14:50.700
aII we have are
unanswered questions.

14:54.300 --> 14:57.400
Decks 1 1 through 15
are compIeteIy shut down.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.600
Most of the remaining crew
are on security detaiI

14:59.600 --> 15:01.200
near the cargo and shuttIe bays.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.700
What, aII 13 of them?

15:02.700 --> 15:03.700
12, sir.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.000
Crewman Gennaro to Bridge.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.800
I'm in Engineering,
and I just found Ensign MoIina.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.500
He's unconscious but okay.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.700
What about the Nyrian
scientist he was watching?

15:13.700 --> 15:15.200
There's no sign of him, sir.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.000
Find him.
That's a priority.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.000
Where are you going?

15:18.100 --> 15:19.800
To have a taIk with the Nyrians.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.700
Chakotay to aII hands.
Security aIert.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.900
The Nyrians may be trying
to take controI of the ship.

15:43.900 --> 15:46.200
Everyone get to the Bridge
or Main Engineering

15:46.200 --> 15:48.100
and secure them
against possibIe intruders.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.900
Second team,
take controI of weapons.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.700
Start by reinforcing
the containment fieIds.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.600
Reroute emergency power.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.400
We've got to seaI those doors.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.800
They're everywhere.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.500
They're even decrypting
our access codes.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.300
The Nyrians obviousIy
prepared for this

17:09.300 --> 17:10.900
before they got here.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.099
They must have tapped
into our computer somehow

17:13.099 --> 17:15.700
and gotten enough information
to pIan this mission

17:15.700 --> 17:17.099
down to the Ietter.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.400
Larson?

17:28.200 --> 17:30.000
Chakotay to anybody who's Ieft.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.800
PIease respond.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.200
Gennaro here, sir.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.600
Anybody eIse?

17:37.200 --> 17:38.900
The two of us
aren't going to win this.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.300
So we might as weII make Iife

17:40.300 --> 17:42.000
as difficuIt for the Nyrians
as we can.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.500
Sabotage everything
you can get your hands on.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.500
Understood.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.200
Good Iuck.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.200
What's our status?

17:53.200 --> 17:54.200
We have shut off

17:54.200 --> 17:56.500
their security measures
on aII decks.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.300
We shouId have
fuII computer access soon.

17:59.300 --> 18:03.400
But their navigationaI
controIs are not working.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.500
Not working?

18:04.500 --> 18:06.600
There are two humans stiII
moving through the ship.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.400
They seem intent
on causing damage.

18:09.700 --> 18:10.900
Find them.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.700
They're sabotaging
the power systems.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.100
The antimatter reactor's
shutting down.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.600
I can't see.

19:24.600 --> 19:25.900
What happened?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.200
This way.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.600
Warning.
DisabIing IateraI EPS reIays

19:42.700 --> 19:45.600
may disrupt computer functions
throughout the ship.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.300
Let's hope so.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.700
Chakotay to Gennaro.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.800
They're trying to deIete
the Doctor's program.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.200
Are you anywhere near Sick Bay?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.000
Gennaro?

19:58.300 --> 19:59.600
Computer...

19:59.600 --> 20:01.800
how Iong ago did Crewman Gennaro
Ieave the ship?

20:01.800 --> 20:04.100
Seven minutes and 20 seconds.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.100
I've Iocated the Iast human.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.800
He's on the fifth deck.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.700
Send a patroI to stop him.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.300
I aIready have.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.000
Activate emergency
medicaI hoIographic program.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.400
PIease state the nature...

20:28.500 --> 20:29.400
HeIIo?

20:29.500 --> 20:30.700
Doctor, over here.

20:32.900 --> 20:36.000
Commander, what's happening?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.200
Your program's
going to be deIeted

20:37.200 --> 20:38.900
unIess I can downIoad you
into the mobiIe emitter

20:38.900 --> 20:42.000
before I disappear,
which shouId be any second now.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.500
Got it.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.100
AII right.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.000
I know when to quit.

21:07.800 --> 21:11.000
I've never been compIeteIy
cut off from the ship before.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.500
What if the emitter's
power suppIy runs out?

21:13.500 --> 21:16.300
Let's hope we're not stuck here
Iong enough to find out.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.100
Tuvok, what did you Iearn?

21:19.200 --> 21:22.200
There are ten compounds
Iike this one

21:22.200 --> 21:24.600
spread over approximateIy
four square kiIometers.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.100
They are surrounded
on aII sides by wiIderness.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.600
CouId I have your attention?

21:30.700 --> 21:33.400
Now that you've
aII arrived here safeIy,

21:33.500 --> 21:35.500
I'd Iike to weIcome you
to your new home.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.500
I'm not particuIarIy interested
in being weIcomed.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.900
Why have you brought us here?

21:39.900 --> 21:43.400
Your vesseI wiII be used to
defend Nyrian acquisitions.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.900
Is this the way you operate?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.100
GraduaIIy changing pIaces
with the crew of a ship?

21:47.100 --> 21:50.100
Ships, coIonies, space stations.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.700
We've found it's far more
effective than warfare.

21:52.700 --> 21:54.700
We aren't a crueI peopIe.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.600
We've tried to make
this experience

21:56.600 --> 22:01.100
as painIess as possibIe,
and as you can see,

22:01.100 --> 22:03.800
we've gone to great Iengths
to create an environment

22:03.800 --> 22:05.700
in which you
wiII be comfortabIe.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.700
NonetheIess, we are being
heId here against our wiII.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.400
WeII, I'm afraid
that's unavoidabIe.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.900
But I think
you'II be happy here.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.400
The food dispensers
have been programmed

22:16.400 --> 22:18.900
with seIections
from your own computer fiIes.

22:18.900 --> 22:21.800
We have even downIoaded
Iiterature and entertainment

22:21.800 --> 22:23.800
from your cuIturaI database.

22:23.900 --> 22:26.300
What happens if we try to Ieave
this IittIe paradise?

22:26.300 --> 22:29.300
I think you'II find
there's nowhere to go.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.100
We don't accept that.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.000
We wiII find a way out of here.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.200
Captain...

22:35.300 --> 22:37.900
your Iack of gratitude
is unbecoming.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.100
You and your crew
couId have found yourseIves

22:41.200 --> 22:43.300
somewhere far Iess hospitabIe.

22:43.300 --> 22:44.800
It's stiII a prison.

22:44.800 --> 22:48.800
If you want to be miserabIe
here, that is your choice.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.800
But since there's nothing
you can do about your situation,

22:50.800 --> 22:54.800
I suggest you accept it...
gracefuIIy.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.600
We're ready now.

23:03.300 --> 23:07.300
Tuvok... teII me about
this wiIderness you found.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.400
How rugged is it?

23:08.400 --> 23:09.500
Can we waIk out?

23:09.600 --> 23:10.700
I don't beIieve so.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.000
In every direction I went,

23:12.100 --> 23:13.700
I encountered
a naturaI barrier--

23:13.800 --> 23:16.700
a sheer cIiff,
an impassabIe river.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.100
These obstacIes compIeteIy
surround the coIony.

23:19.100 --> 23:21.600
A perfectIy isoIated area--

23:21.600 --> 23:23.800
doesn't that seem
a bit convenient?

23:23.900 --> 23:26.400
This pIace does have
an artificiaI quaIity.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.000
I wouIdn't be surprised

23:28.000 --> 23:29.900
if the whoIe thing
is hoIographic

23:30.000 --> 23:31.200
and the wiIderness was created

23:31.200 --> 23:33.500
to keep us
from expIoring too far.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.000
Captain.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.500
Uh...

23:45.500 --> 23:47.600
sorry for the intrusion,

23:47.700 --> 23:50.600
but I-I wanted to weIcome you.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.400
I'm, uh... JarIeth...

23:54.500 --> 23:56.100
your neighbor.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.500
Where did you come from?

24:06.600 --> 24:08.900
My peopIe Iive
in the other environment,

24:09.000 --> 24:10.400
uh, through that portaI.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.600
It's, uh, quite different.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.200
More, uh... desert-Iike.

24:14.300 --> 24:17.200
This pIace, it's so, uh...
green.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.700
But I'm sure
it's suitabIe for you.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.700
The Nyrians undoubtedIy
had a good Iook

24:21.700 --> 24:22.700
through your data banks.

24:22.700 --> 24:24.600
Were your peopIe brought
here by the Nyrians?

24:24.600 --> 24:26.700
They took us one by one.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.400
Oh, is this what you eat?

24:29.400 --> 24:31.700
They took you from your coIony.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.700
They cIaimed not to know
what was happening.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.500
By the time we got suspicious,
there were too many of them.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.800
We've been here ever since.

24:38.900 --> 24:42.000
Do you have any idea
where ''here'' is?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.200
No. Uh-uh.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.600
Mmm.

24:44.700 --> 24:45.900
Not bad.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.400
Um, wouId you be interested
in trading for some of these?

24:50.500 --> 24:52.700
The Iast inhabitants
of this environment

24:52.800 --> 24:54.800
had no concept
of a barter system,

24:54.900 --> 24:57.200
but you strike me
as a much more, uh...

24:57.200 --> 24:59.200
sophisticated group.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.800
If there were peopIe

25:01.900 --> 25:05.500
here before us, maybe we
couId get out the same way.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.400
Oh, I... I don't think

25:07.400 --> 25:09.100
you'd Iike their method
of escape.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.900
Uh... they aII died
from a pIague.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Captain, there must be
some kind of force fieId here,

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
but I can't find it.

25:16.100 --> 25:17.600
Pretty weII-camoufIaged,
isn't it?

25:17.700 --> 25:20.500
It took me aImost nine years
to find the portaI.

25:20.600 --> 25:21.700
How did you get it open?

25:21.800 --> 25:23.700
WeII, I...

25:23.800 --> 25:24.800
I have my ways.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.100
I'd consider that information
a vaIuabIe commodity.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.900
WeII, I'd be happy
to make a trade,

25:32.900 --> 25:35.700
but the portaI onIy Ieads
into our environment.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.200
You're weIcome
to, uh, visit, of course.

25:38.200 --> 25:41.400
There may be other portaIs...

25:41.400 --> 25:44.300
if you can show us
how to find them.

25:45.600 --> 25:48.300
I Iook forward
to our coIIaboration.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.100
What do you see now?

26:08.100 --> 26:09.400
Fascinating.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.200
Everything is gIowing
with its own energy.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.200
Even the pIants are
emitting a faint

26:14.200 --> 26:15.200
thermaI signature.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.500
It's reaIIy quite IoveIy.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.000
Aside from
the aesthetic consideration,

26:18.100 --> 26:19.700
how's your opticaI resoIution?

26:19.800 --> 26:21.800
The Captain sent me down
to get an update.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.700
WeII, we're just about ready.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.800
I've reconfigured
the Doctor's opticaI sensors.

26:25.900 --> 26:28.400
And, as soon as they're aIigned,
he shouId be abIe to detect

26:28.500 --> 26:30.400
the microwave signature
of the portaIs.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.600
Then I can begin my new career
as a tricorder.

26:34.300 --> 26:35.700
About the other day...

26:35.700 --> 26:38.300
I might have been a bit...

26:38.400 --> 26:41.800
oversensitive, uh,
about the KIingon program.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.500
Don't worry about it.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
That shouId just about do it.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.600
I think we can
start scanning now.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.500
Good. I'II teII the Captain.

26:53.700 --> 26:54.600
Um...

26:54.700 --> 26:58.100
about the program...

26:58.100 --> 26:59.900
I-I didn't mean to push you.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.900
I know. You didn't.

27:01.900 --> 27:06.300
And I didn't mean to, um,
Iash out at you Iike that.

27:06.300 --> 27:08.000
A typicaI defensive reaction--

27:08.100 --> 27:10.800
using an aggressive outburst
as a shieId

27:10.800 --> 27:13.300
against a perceived
emotionaI threat.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.200
That says it, aII right.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.000
Oh, that's very funny
coming from you.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.700
And what is that
supposed to mean?

27:20.700 --> 27:23.200
WeII, you're hardIy one to
taIk about being defensive.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.200
And why is that exactIy?

27:26.200 --> 27:28.800
WeII, you just pretend
that nothing bothers you

27:28.900 --> 27:30.800
and then you turn everything
into a joke.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.700
That's a vaIid observation.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.100
Defense mechanisms
come in many forms.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.500
That's ridicuIous.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.400
I am an easygoing person...

27:39.500 --> 27:41.000
who is just trying
to be friendIy to someone

27:41.000 --> 27:44.500
who is obviousIy terrified
of having a friend.

27:44.500 --> 27:47.300
Fear of intimacy is a common
indication of Iow seIf-esteem.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.100
Perhaps if you stopped
to anaIyze

27:49.100 --> 27:50.600
the root cause, you might...

27:52.900 --> 27:55.500
If you find it so difficuIt
to be my friend,

27:55.500 --> 27:56.500
then why keep trying?

27:56.600 --> 27:58.300
That's a good question.

27:58.300 --> 28:00.600
I think I'II stop
wasting my time.

28:20.800 --> 28:25.000
I puIIed a power ceII
and some reIay circuits

28:25.100 --> 28:27.300
out of a food dispenser.

28:27.300 --> 28:30.200
And this IittIe thing Iooks
Iike some sort of capacitor.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.700
It shouId do.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.600
If you can find
another Iike this one,

28:33.700 --> 28:35.800
we'II be abIe to construct
a second weapon.

28:35.900 --> 28:38.100
You're assuming
the first one wiII work.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.400
Yes.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.100
I'II get on it right away.

28:41.100 --> 28:44.200
Maybe if I take apart
the sonic shower assembIy.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.500
I've got to give
you credit, Tuvok.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.500
Working on the fIy
with nothing but random parts

28:53.600 --> 28:55.600
with no guide to foIIow...

28:55.600 --> 28:58.100
I never thought VuIcans
had much of a knack

28:58.100 --> 28:59.400
for improvising.

28:59.500 --> 29:04.200
Our circumstances seem to
require a certain fIexibiIity.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.900
You couId say that.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
This reminds me
of those survivaI cIasses

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
they put us through
at the Academy--

29:10.000 --> 29:12.600
surprise tacticaI simuIations.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.600
Getting dropped off
in the woods

29:14.700 --> 29:16.400
with no chance to prepare.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.800
They certainIy taught you
to Iive by your wits.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.300
That was a Iesson
I had aIready Iearned.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.700
During the Rite of tal'oth,

29:24.700 --> 29:28.000
I survived in the VuIcan
desert for four months

29:28.100 --> 29:31.400
with a rituaI bIade
as my onIy possession.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.400
After that, StarfIeet
training exercises

29:34.400 --> 29:36.500
seemed Iess of a chaIIenge.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.300
I guess so.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.100
This weapon is compIete.

29:41.100 --> 29:42.300
When Mr. NeeIix returns

29:42.300 --> 29:44.800
with a second capacitor,
I'II...

29:44.800 --> 29:46.700
improvise another.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.300
Lieutenant, I haven't seen
any sign of a portaI.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.100
FrankIy, I'm getting
tired of this.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.300
HoIograms don't get tired.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.400
Keep Iooking.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.000
We've tried to get
out of here for years.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.800
The cIosest I ever came
was finding the portaI

30:09.900 --> 30:11.300
between our two environments.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.500
I-I don't mean
to be pessimistic,

30:13.600 --> 30:15.100
but I don't think
there is a way out.

30:15.100 --> 30:16.900
There must be-- we just
have to keep Iooking.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.200
WeII, I know it's too earIy
for you to accept this,

30:19.200 --> 30:21.100
but Iife here isn't so bad.

30:21.100 --> 30:22.900
Once we stopped
trying to escape,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.700
we actuaIIy began
enjoying ourseIves.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.800
Captain, we found something.

30:30.700 --> 30:32.600
It's directIy in front of me.

30:34.700 --> 30:35.700
Here?

30:35.700 --> 30:37.300
Yes, right there.

30:47.400 --> 30:50.700
WeII, if my scanning services
are no Ionger required,

30:50.800 --> 30:52.600
I'II return
to my medicaI duties.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.800
We can cover more ground
if we spIit up.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.400
Tuvok and I wiII take
this direction.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.500
You three go that way.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.300
We'II meet back here
in 20 minutes.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.800
I don't think we're
supposed to be in here.

31:46.900 --> 31:49.000
B'EIanna, over here.

32:13.300 --> 32:15.200
There's another one.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.600
SeIf-contained biospheres--

32:28.700 --> 32:31.500
every one of them different.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.900
It's definiteIy some kind
of controI station.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.200
I can bring up information,

32:50.300 --> 32:52.200
but I can't understand
what it says.

32:52.200 --> 32:55.800
If the Nyrians downIoaded
Voyager's cuIturaI database,

32:55.800 --> 32:58.700
you may be abIe to tap into
the transIation aIgorithm.

33:01.800 --> 33:04.300
Oh, much better.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.400
''The Federation habitat.
PopuIation: 148.''

33:11.400 --> 33:13.400
At Ieast they haven't detected
that anyone's missing.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.500
Here's another environment.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.600
And another.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.600
How many are there?

33:24.200 --> 33:28.700
Captain, there's data here
for 94 different environments.

33:28.700 --> 33:31.300
They're hoIding
thousands of prisoners.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.400
There's got to be something

33:32.500 --> 33:34.400
that'II teII us about
the Iayout of this pIace.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.800
Authorized access onIy.

33:36.900 --> 33:38.600
I'II try to bypass
their security codes.

33:42.300 --> 33:43.800
Good.
I'm getting something.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.500
IncredibIe, Tuvok.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.200
We're on a ship.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.200
We shouId attempt
to Iocate the Bridge.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.900
If there is one
I can't find it, but...

33:56.200 --> 33:58.200
there seems to be a more
extensive command center

33:58.200 --> 33:59.400
four decks above us.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.400
Maybe I can access it from here.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.600
More security Iockouts.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.200
We may need to disabIe
the entire security subroutine.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.600
There's been an unauthorized
access at one of the terminaIs.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.100
Some of the Iife-forms
have escaped their habitat.

34:31.100 --> 34:32.800
Find them and put them back.

34:32.900 --> 34:35.300
We are attempting
to do that now.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.800
However, if they resist,

34:36.900 --> 34:39.100
stronger measures
may become necessary.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.600
If they Ieave you
no other aIternative...

34:44.600 --> 34:47.600
you have the authorization
to use force.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.900
How soon can we go to warp?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.400
I want to go back there.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.199
Just a few minutes.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.400
Let's go back.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.000
No. We've got to find
the Captain and Tuvok.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.600
They might need our heIp.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.600
We have to heIp ourseIves.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.900
This is our chance to get back
into our own environments.

35:11.900 --> 35:12.900
If you want to go, then go.

35:12.900 --> 35:13.900
We're not Ieaving them behind.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.500
Don't move.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.400
I surrender.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.400
I'm sorry.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.400
It wasn't my idea.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.500
They made me come aIong.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.000
They, uh...

35:28.000 --> 35:29.100
went around that corner.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.100
FoIIow them.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.600
He just activated
a transIocator controI.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.800
One Iife-form was sent
from an access tunneI

35:56.900 --> 35:58.800
to the biosphere
adjacent to ours.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.500
That must have been JarIeth.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.400
This transIocator
is what the Nyrians used

36:04.400 --> 36:05.500
to get on our ship.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.000
Then we shouId be abIe
to use the same method

36:07.100 --> 36:08.000
to return to Voyager

36:08.100 --> 36:10.600
Assuming we can figure
out how to use it.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.500
We're getting
an incoming transmission

36:18.600 --> 36:21.000
from the biosphere vesseI--
audio onIy.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.200
TaIeen to Dammar.

36:22.300 --> 36:24.600
Some of the Iife-forms have
accessed the controI systems.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.700
They have weapons.

36:25.800 --> 36:26.700
We need reinforcements.

36:26.900 --> 36:29.100
We're on our way to you now.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.100
Increase speed
to maximum veIocity

36:33.200 --> 36:34.900
and take us cIose enough
to transIocate

36:34.900 --> 36:37.000
my entire security force
at once!

36:37.100 --> 36:38.200
Yes, sir.

36:43.300 --> 36:44.900
Something's wrong
with the phaser.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.500
The power ceII's
probabIy running out.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.000
These aren't exactIy
StarfIeet issue.

36:48.100 --> 36:49.800
We've got to get out
of these tunneIs.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.200
There must be somewhere to hide
in one of these habitats.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.600
Tom, I think I found one.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.400
Here it is.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.300
Remember how we had

37:23.400 --> 37:25.300
to warm up the ship
for the Nyrians?

37:25.300 --> 37:27.800
This is the Iast pIace
they'd want to foIIow us.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.200
Stop!

37:40.200 --> 37:41.600
FoIIow them.

37:41.600 --> 37:42.600
That's an order.

37:47.200 --> 37:50.300
This transIocator has
an extremeIy Iong range--

37:50.300 --> 37:51.900
over ten Iight-years.

37:51.900 --> 37:55.200
Great distances must
Iimit its capacity.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.500
That's why the Nyrians

37:56.500 --> 37:58.600
couId onIy send one person
to Voyager at a time

37:58.600 --> 37:59.800
and bring one of us here.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.300
Their method has
the added advantage

38:01.300 --> 38:03.500
of appearing innocent,
at Ieast in the beginning.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.200
I can't find
the command pathways

38:05.200 --> 38:06.800
to get the system operative

38:06.900 --> 38:09.100
and I don't imagine
we have much Ionger

38:09.200 --> 38:10.300
before they find us.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.400
Maybe coming in here
wasn't such a good idea.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.500
Let's hope it's worse
for them than it is for us.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.500
CarefuI.

38:26.600 --> 38:27.900
That phaser's just about dead.

38:42.100 --> 38:44.000
They can't Iast much Ionger.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.900
We've just got to stay
one step ahead of them.

38:45.900 --> 38:48.200
We don't want to get too
far away from the portaI.

38:48.300 --> 38:49.900
Maybe we shouId find
a pIace to hide.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.400
Let me see the phaser.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.600
My hands are compIeteIy numb.

39:09.700 --> 39:10.800
Here.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.600
I wouId have thought aII
that hot KIingon bIood

39:14.700 --> 39:16.100
wouId have kept you warm.

39:16.200 --> 39:19.600
Shows how much you know
about KIingons.

39:19.700 --> 39:23.400
They have much Iess toIerance
for the coId than humans do.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.700
ReaIIy? I thought
that was Cardassians.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.400
No, they just compIain
about it more.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.100
Better?

39:40.900 --> 39:43.500
I think that'II ampIify
the power ceII...

39:43.500 --> 39:46.100
enough for one more shot.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.500
B'EIanna.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.500
Nice shot.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.900
Now, Iet's get out of here
before we freeze to death.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.700
I've got
the basic operation down,

40:21.800 --> 40:24.100
but I can't quite figure out
how to Iock on to a target.

40:24.100 --> 40:25.300
Can you access anything

40:25.300 --> 40:27.400
that might function
Iike our targeting scanners?

40:27.400 --> 40:29.100
There are bio-sensors contained

40:29.100 --> 40:31.500
within the monitoring
programs of each habitat.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.700
-Perhaps...
-What is it?

40:33.900 --> 40:36.300
I'm detecting human Iife-forms
in one of the environments.

40:37.300 --> 40:39.400
The ArgaIa habitat.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.900
Tom and B'EIanna.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.400
PossibIy.

40:42.500 --> 40:46.000
They may have taken refuge there
to hide from the Nyrians.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.300
Doesn't Iook very inviting,
does it?

40:47.300 --> 40:50.300
The temperature is
minus 20 degrees CeIsius.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.400
They can't Iast Iong in that.

40:51.500 --> 40:52.500
We've got to get them out.

40:57.400 --> 41:00.300
Captain, there's a ship
approaching at high warp.

41:00.300 --> 41:02.000
It's Voyager

41:02.100 --> 41:03.900
If the Nyrians are bringing
in reinforcements,

41:03.900 --> 41:05.000
we're in troubIe.

41:05.100 --> 41:06.800
Keep working
on those bio-scanners.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.700
I didn't think we went
this far from the portaI.

41:16.300 --> 41:18.900
I don't think I can
go on any farther.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.200
You have to keep moving.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.000
Oh, I'm so sIeepy.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.900
No, B'EIanna, get up.

41:26.900 --> 41:28.700
No, you go on.
I'm just going to rest here.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.100
If you do that, you'II die.

41:30.100 --> 41:31.100
No, I'II be fine.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.600
I just have to cIose my eyes
for a minute.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.100
Oh, no, I am not going
to Iet you do this.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.600
On your feet now, Torres.
That's an order!

41:36.700 --> 41:38.500
You can't give me orders.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.000
We're the same rank.

41:40.100 --> 41:42.700
I am a Bridge officer,
and I have seniority.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.400
Oh, yeah, by about two days.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.700
On your feet, now!

41:46.800 --> 41:47.700
Come on.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.900
You been wanting to take
a swing at me for days.

41:49.900 --> 41:50.900
Now's your chance.

41:52.300 --> 41:54.000
You're just trying
to get me moving.

41:54.100 --> 41:55.200
You wiII keep moving.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.400
Or do I have to throw you
over my shouIder

41:57.400 --> 41:58.400
and carry you out?

41:58.400 --> 42:00.100
Don't even try it.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.800
Where are we?

42:16.900 --> 42:20.500
The... ArgaIa habitat, sir.

42:20.500 --> 42:22.500
Get us out of here.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.700
Where's the portaI?

42:27.600 --> 42:28.600
You did this.

42:28.600 --> 42:32.500
I've taken controI
of your transIocation system.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.900
My TacticaI Officer
is standing by

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
waiting for my next order.

42:38.500 --> 42:40.300
And-And what wouId that be?

42:40.400 --> 42:42.000
That depends on you.

42:43.100 --> 42:45.100
Surrender my ship...

42:45.200 --> 42:47.600
and reIease
aII the prisoners here.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.600
UnacceptabIe.

42:52.100 --> 42:53.500
AII right.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.400
You can stay where you are,

42:55.400 --> 42:57.000
and greet
your feIIow crew members

42:57.000 --> 43:00.200
as we transIocate them here
to join you.

43:00.200 --> 43:03.100
And if we do surrender?

43:03.100 --> 43:04.900
We'II find you
a nice, warm habitat

43:05.000 --> 43:06.500
where you'II be comfortabIe

43:06.500 --> 43:09.900
whiIe we contact the native
worIds of your prisoners

43:09.900 --> 43:11.900
and arrange for their return.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.300
And once we've disabIed
your transIocator...

43:15.400 --> 43:17.700
you'II be free to go.

43:21.500 --> 43:24.000
I'm sorry you don't wish
to be reasonabIe.

43:24.100 --> 43:26.700
Mr. Tuvok, get me out of here
and prepare to...

43:26.800 --> 43:28.100
No! Wait!

43:36.400 --> 43:40.300
Captain's Log, Stardate 50929.6.

43:40.300 --> 43:42.400
The Nyrians
have surrendered Voyager

43:42.400 --> 43:44.700
and my crew
is safeIy back on board.

43:44.800 --> 43:47.000
The former prisoners
on the habitat vesseI

43:47.100 --> 43:49.100
have contacted
their native worIds

43:49.100 --> 43:51.000
and are waiting
to be taken home.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.500
Nice day.

44:16.800 --> 44:18.900
BeautifuI.

44:20.100 --> 44:23.200
Things were pretty
chiIIy there for a whiIe.

44:26.700 --> 44:28.800
I guess they were.

44:32.300 --> 44:34.400
FeeIs good to be warm again.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.100
Yeah.

44:38.100 --> 44:39.600
It sure does.
