I want one! I want one!

01:07.358 --> 01:09.611
Sure, a teddy bear makes babies happy,

but the ICP 1-9-B will make babies
do that face

01:12.697 --> 01:15.533

they can't breathe. [coos]

01:16.034 --> 01:18.119
That's the face we're aiming for, people.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.873
Maximize baby cuteness,
you maximize baby love.

01:21.956 --> 01:24.667
We're running a full field test
of every plushy combo.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.962
Staci, octo-bear with antlers.
Jimbo, elephant-faced panda seal.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.255
I love it. What is it?

01:29.339 --> 01:32.258
Doesn't matter.
I'll try out rhino-moose-bear-- [snores]

Boss? Boss!

01:35.512 --> 01:39.057
[grunts] Trickle-down economics!
Wait, what happened?

01:39.140 --> 01:40.642
You fell a night-night.

01:40.725 --> 01:44.687
-[gasps] On the job?
-No judgment, sir. Everybody naps.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.732
Everybody naps at nap time,
not on the clock.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.442
That's-- [snores]

01:49.526 --> 01:50.610

-No!

01:55.240 --> 01:56.157
[groans] Okay.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.868
[snorts] Giraffes are a lie.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.788
[gasps] Again? Something's wrong.

02:01.871 --> 02:05.291
One nap, nobody's perfect, but two?
It's unnatural.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.545
We need to get to the bottom of this.
Track down every possible source

02:08.628 --> 02:10.046
of whatever's making me sleepy:

02:10.130 --> 02:12.882
climate control problems,
gas leak from diaper disposal,

02:12.966 --> 02:14.676
some sort of subliminal--

02:16.636 --> 02:19.430
Eh? Oh... how long was I out?

02:19.514 --> 02:21.933
I don't know, but things got worse.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.394
-Worse?
-[drawls] Way worse.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.521
-Agh!
-I know, right?

02:26.604 --> 02:31.276
What happened to my voice?
Why am I talking like this? There's more.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.410
Jimbo, did you eat a second,
smaller Jimbo?

02:40.493 --> 02:43.538
-[grunts] My diaper pinches.
-So it's not just me.

02:43.621 --> 02:49.294
Something and/or someone did this to us.
But why? And/or who?

02:49.377 --> 02:51.671
Bootsy Calico?

02:51.754 --> 02:55.508
But there's no kitten angle.
And we've been here the whole time.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.468
Bootsy's got no access to Baby Corp.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.722
No. We have to think outside the box.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.849
Big ideas! No theory too wild!

03:02.932 --> 03:04.100
Let's do this!

03:07.228 --> 03:11.858
-Why am I holding a crayon?
-You fell asleep for, like, two hours.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.484
-What?
-But don't worry.

03:13.568 --> 03:17.113
We still brainstormed
some pretty big ideas.

03:17.196 --> 03:21.326
Two hours and you two made one drawing
of Bootsy Calico with a stinky head?

03:21.409 --> 03:26.039
Actually, boss,
you drew the stinky lines, in your sleep.

03:26.122 --> 03:30.209
We already ruled out Bootsy Calico.
I said, outside-the-box ideas.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.545
[grunts] Where's the original thinking?

03:32.629 --> 03:37.091
Sir, we work for a large corporation.
Look around you.

03:37.175 --> 03:41.221
-There is no imagination.
-I don't buy it.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.557
[loudly] Hey, what's everybody
wearing to work tomorrow?

03:44.641 --> 03:47.101
[all] Professional business attire!

03:47.185 --> 03:50.146
-[groans] Sassy-voice Staci is right.
-[Staci] Duh.

03:50.230 --> 03:54.525
We need someone with more imagination.
And I know just the man.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.611
[Tim] Bring it on, space creeps.

03:56.694 --> 04:02.700
It'll take more than space garbage
to stop Dekker Moonboots, space detective!

04:02.825 --> 04:04.202
-[thumping]
-Templeton!

04:04.911 --> 04:06.829
We've got a mystery on our hands
at Baby Corp.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.415
A mystery, you say? What kind?

04:09.499 --> 04:12.460
The kind that needs
a special brand of crazy.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.712
Dekker Moonboots crazy?

04:16.673 --> 04:18.800
Let's talk supplies.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.804
I'm gonna need a whole set
of those markers that smell like food.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.764
-Done.
-And a spinny chair.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.808
-We'll see what we can do.
-Animal crackers,

04:26.891 --> 04:28.977
-no rhinos.
-They all taste the same.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.730
Danny Petrosky said his uncle ate a rhino,
and his stomach exploded.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.691
Danny is a liar and a moron.

04:34.774 --> 04:39.112
We gonna argue about animal crackers,
or am I gonna solve a space mystery?

04:39.195 --> 04:41.990
Fine! Unusual problems call
for unusual solutions,

04:42.073 --> 04:44.325
and you are nothing if not-- [snoring]

04:44.409 --> 04:46.703
-Whoa!
-Careful, sir!

04:46.786 --> 04:48.538

-[Jimbo] Boss!

04:49.789 --> 04:51.499

04:53.418 --> 04:57.755
Wait, that's your mystery?
Voice changing, getting bigger,

04:57.839 --> 05:00.508
-needing extra naps?
-[snores] You have theories?

05:00.591 --> 05:03.970
-Hit me, Moonboots.
-[sighs] There's no mystery.

05:04.053 --> 05:07.056
-You're having a growth spurt.
-I'm not following.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.767
It's what happens when you grow up.
Your body changes,

05:09.851 --> 05:13.438
and the little factory inside goes,
"Toot-toot! Break time!"

05:13.521 --> 05:16.983
-When did my body go union?
-You need extra naps because

05:17.066 --> 05:20.111
-your body's working so hard at growing.
-Impossible.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.031
Hmm. Are you having other symptoms?

05:23.114 --> 05:27.827
Uh, little bit of baby acne on my tush.
Staci says I'm having mood swings,

05:27.910 --> 05:31.456
but Staci can't see inside of me!
You don't know everything!

05:31.539 --> 05:34.667
I want to be a dancer! [sobs]

05:34.751 --> 05:39.047
-[gasps] I'm growing up.
-[sighs] You didn't need Dekker Moonboots,

05:39.130 --> 05:41.340
but I will take those markers
that smell like food.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.301
[sniffs]

05:43.384 --> 05:45.219
Ooh, hot dog.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.722
No, Templeton,
this is literally impossible.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.600
All Baby Corp employees drink
a special formula.

05:50.683 --> 05:54.228
Yeah, it's supposed
to keep us babies forever.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.939
Something went wrong.
It wouldn't be just us aging.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.816

Mega Fat CEO Baby demands your attention!

06:31.474 --> 06:34.143
Make the opening small talk
"blah-blah" for me.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.855
Imagine this announcement has started
with a humorous anecdote

06:37.939 --> 06:39.941
and laugh appropriately!

No, you love me the most, and you!
Hey there!

06:46.364 --> 06:49.242
Okay, I understand some of you
are changing

06:49.325 --> 06:52.203
and just acting like real grown-ups.

06:52.286 --> 06:56.165
As CEO, let me assure you,
change is totally normal.

06:56.249 --> 07:01.212
-Nature has a way of sorting things out.
-[chuckling] Thank goodness.

07:01.295 --> 07:04.298
That's why I'm going to fire
everyone who's aging.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.552
Let's say, by end of business today.
Why not?

07:07.635 --> 07:10.304
-[staff yelling]
-[alarm blaring]

07:10.388 --> 07:14.851
This is a baby corporation.
If you can't handle your baby formula,

07:14.934 --> 07:18.229
you have no business here.
Again, normal, nature's way. Peace out.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.190
-[baby] No!
-You are all expendable!

You're making me emotional!

Oh, my acne.

07:38.791 --> 07:42.170
-Everyone, calm down!
-Oof!

07:42.253 --> 07:44.255
We'll figure this out
before anyone gets fired.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.966
-Whee!
-Moonboots, good call on the aging.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.760
So, new mystery.
Wow us with that outside-the-box thinking.

07:49.844 --> 07:54.182
What's wrong with the formula?
Bad batch? Past its expiration date?

07:54.265 --> 08:00.271
Here's how I see it: a race of aliens
that age backwards, old folks to babies.

08:00.354 --> 08:03.608
They're trying to change your formula
so they can be old forever.

08:03.691 --> 08:06.777
Their company? Old Alien Baby Corp.

08:06.861 --> 08:10.656
-It's on Mars.
-Uh, take one step back inside the box.

08:10.740 --> 08:14.785
Or... Vent Babies.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.162
"Vent Babies"?

08:16.245 --> 08:19.332
They live in your air vents
and steal your formula.

08:19.415 --> 08:22.210
[whispers]
They could be watching us right now.

08:22.293 --> 08:25.129
Stop talking.
You said, "Steal our formula"?

08:25.213 --> 08:29.842
Well, Old Alien Baby Corp was built
in the Martian year 74 billion--

08:29.926 --> 08:33.387
This was no accident.
Someone's tampered with the formula!

08:33.804 --> 08:35.556
OMG!

08:55.618 --> 08:57.453
[spits] The formula's been tainted.

-[spits] Super tainted.
-[deep voice] I concur.

Normal Baby Corp formula,

09:04.502 --> 09:06.754
You separated them in your mouth?

09:06.837 --> 09:12.426
Oh... yeah!

09:12.510 --> 09:16.347
We get it!
You have a super cool deep voice now.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.766
So someone did tamper with the formula.

09:18.849 --> 09:21.227
The vanilla milkshake
must've thrown off the effect,

09:21.310 --> 09:24.897
-causing rapid aging.
-Dekker Moonboots, you've done it again.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.573
You're talking to the CEO?

11:39.657 --> 11:45.204
Can you pitch him this idea I had?
Invisible pacifiers!

11:45.287 --> 11:48.165
We'd all look like fish! [smacking]

11:49.500 --> 11:52.503
Um... we're just gonna go.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.179
♪ La, la-la la-la-la, la-la ♪

12:02.263 --> 12:06.058
♪ La-la-- ♪ Oh, sorry.
Mood swing went super happy.

12:06.642 --> 12:10.813
I figured out your little formula scheme,
Mega Fat CEO traitor!

12:10.896 --> 12:14.233
-And you're not getting away with it.
-[Mega Fat CEO Baby] Magnus?

12:14.567 --> 12:16.610
[clapping]

12:16.694 --> 12:18.446
[Mega Fat CEO Baby]
Congratulations, Boss Baby.

12:18.529 --> 12:22.032
You solved the mystery of,
"Is Boss Baby wrong about everything?"

12:22.491 --> 12:25.119
-The secret answer, "Yes."
-[Boss Baby] Whoa!

12:25.202 --> 12:26.787
[laughing]

12:26.871 --> 12:29.957
Your mockery only makes me want to
fire everyone faster.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.835
What about you?
Should I go get you a mirror

12:32.918 --> 12:36.130
so you can watch as you fire yourself?
[laughing]

12:36.714 --> 12:39.383
Joking on the job.
Very unprofessional, Boss Baby.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.801
You're unprofessional!

12:40.885 --> 12:44.889
The baby in formula storage
said you tainted the formula.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.266
Which all makes sense, except... boop!

12:47.349 --> 12:50.394
There aren't any babies working
in formula storage.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.397
-What?
-Oh, twist!

12:53.481 --> 12:55.733
Wait a sec. So who was Frankie?

12:55.816 --> 12:58.527
Weird kid, creepy, pants-less?
But we've all been there.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.570
Never heard of him.

12:59.653 --> 13:02.990
Though I can't be expected to remember
names of people I don't care about.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.701
How many times
have I called Magnus "Jason"?

13:05.784 --> 13:09.497
Five hundred thirty-two,
and it hurts every time.

13:09.580 --> 13:13.042
If no one works in formula storage,
what was she even doing there?

13:13.125 --> 13:16.170
Isn't it obvious? She's the formula thief.

13:16.253 --> 13:19.548
-Hi!
-[gasps, screams]

13:20.925 --> 13:24.929
Vent Baby!
Moonboots, you've solved it again.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.306
-[Mega Fat CEO Baby yelping]
-[loud thudding]

13:28.557 --> 13:32.228
[Boss Baby]
So, anybody going after them or...?

13:32.311 --> 13:36.482
[Magnus] Enclosed spaces
make me emotional and violent.

13:36.565 --> 13:40.027
Ugh. Fine. Jimbo, block the vent
so she doesn't double back.

13:44.281 --> 13:48.828
[Mega Fat CEO Baby] Oh, no!
Please! Have mercy! [wails]

13:48.953 --> 13:52.081
-This way. But no rush.
-[Mega Fat CEO Baby] I'll do anything!

13:52.456 --> 13:54.124
Oh, please! [sobbing]

13:54.542 --> 13:58.837
Oh, no, no more. This is unbearable.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.173
Game's over, Frankie. Give us-- Wha...?

14:01.257 --> 14:05.719
My next idea:
Who says we have to work in cubicles?

14:05.803 --> 14:09.807
Close your eyes and imagine...
office carnival!

14:09.890 --> 14:11.850
With roller-coaster desks!

14:12.726 --> 14:16.146
Boss Baby, save me! This is agony!

14:16.230 --> 14:21.277
-Hey! This is a private meeting.
-Meeting's over, Vent Baby.

14:21.360 --> 14:25.114
Oh! Oh, thank you, Boss Baby.
I knew I could count on you.

14:25.197 --> 14:28.284
I'll be back with security,
freakish Vent Baby.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.995
-But--
-Where do you think you're going?

14:31.078 --> 14:33.706
I didn't finish telling him
my great ideas.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.708
Forget it, Frankie. You're done.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.710
[sobs]

14:39.211 --> 14:43.507
Please, Boss Baby. I meant no harm, sir.

14:43.591 --> 14:48.345
Whoa. Uh... please stop crying.
It's weird and creepy.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.473
I'm emotionally vulnerable right now!
So stop it.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.850
[sobbing]

14:52.933 --> 14:57.438
I can't stop.
Oh, please, don't make me leave, sir.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.607
I love Baby Corp.

14:59.690 --> 15:03.235
-How did you get here in the first place?
-Nobody asked for backstory.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.945
Keep her here until security--

15:05.029 --> 15:09.575
-I came from the factory, like all babies.
-[Boss Baby sighs]

15:09.658 --> 15:13.162
[Frankie] I was so excited.
I had great ideas already,

15:13.245 --> 15:15.623
like a shortcut to the chute
where they sort babies

15:15.706 --> 15:19.126
-into families or management.
-[yelling]

15:19.710 --> 15:22.379
Well, obviously,
that one didn't work, but...

15:22.463 --> 15:25.007
-[Tim] You never got placed anywhere.
-[screams]

15:25.090 --> 15:30.054
I had nowhere to go,
so I fled into the walls of Baby Corp.

15:30.137 --> 15:33.057
And I've been here ever since.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.936
-[security] Which way was this hideout?
-[Mega Fat CEO Baby] What am I, a map?

15:37.019 --> 15:40.022
Security's coming, Frankie.
You're still a formula thief.

15:40.105 --> 15:44.360
I had to, so I could stay young
like a real executive.

15:44.443 --> 15:48.948
Then I needed more and more once
I assembled my own team, just like yours.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.617
Jeez! There's more than one
of you Vent Babies?

15:51.700 --> 15:55.454
This is Jonesy, my right-hand man
and the office jokester.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.997
[laughs]

15:57.081 --> 15:59.291
Oh, stop, you're so bad.

16:00.417 --> 16:04.797
This is Stapler. He's a stapler,
but he thinks he's a real baby.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.298
Shh. Don't tell him.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.385
The newest member of the team,
Headless Bear,

16:09.468 --> 16:11.679
fresh from your R&amp;D department.

16:11.762 --> 16:18.602
And last but not least, Poobag MacDougal,
the brains of the operation.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.647
-It's very nice to meet your team.
-No. Stop indulging this.

16:21.730 --> 16:25.150
-You're gonna cost us our jobs!
-Jeez. Mood swing.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.860
No, I'm genuinely angry!

16:26.944 --> 16:31.573
I'm sorry. I tried adding the vanilla
milkshake so no one would know.

16:31.657 --> 16:35.285
But what was I supposed to do?
Let Stapler starve?

16:35.369 --> 16:39.999
That's right, you need formula, Stapler,
because you're a baby.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.458
[Mega Fat CEO Baby] Maybe the left?

16:41.542 --> 16:44.712
[security] I think we'd move faster
if we didn't have to carry you.

16:44.795 --> 16:48.173
[Mega Fat CEO Baby] Wah, wah, wah!
That's what you sound like.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.677
-Getting closer, sir.
-He's in a firing mood, Frankie.

16:51.760 --> 16:55.431
-It's you or us. Frankly, it's you.
-But this is my life.

16:55.514 --> 17:00.144
I can be an asset to Baby Corp.
I have lots of great ideas.

17:00.227 --> 17:04.106
[gasps] Maybe you'd like to hear them.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.858
-Not really.
-Of course we do.

17:05.941 --> 17:09.695
I solved your mystery.
This is what I want for payment.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.406
Just listen to her ideas, okay?

17:12.740 --> 17:16.285
[groans] Oh, fine.

17:16.368 --> 17:20.998
I would love to hear your ideas.
But I reserve the right to fall asleep,

17:21.081 --> 17:23.292
get moody and/or scratch my acned tushie.

17:23.375 --> 17:28.297
Thank you, sir. This means...
[moans] ...so much!

17:30.799 --> 17:36.430
And now I can't fall out of my shirt
at my desk. Thanks, Stapler!

17:37.056 --> 17:39.058
Upside-down meetings!

17:39.141 --> 17:43.937
Think how many more ideas we'll have
with extra blood rushing to our heads.

17:45.564 --> 17:49.359
And now you have a million cookies
instead of one.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.864
Turn it inside out
and you can use it again!

17:53.947 --> 17:57.451
I always overhear CEO Baby
complaining about the budget.

17:57.534 --> 18:01.872
Think of the quarterly savings. Thank you.

18:04.958 --> 18:09.797
Those are the worst ideas I've ever heard,
anywhere, ever, and I live with this guy.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.673
-Hey!
-But maybe--

18:11.757 --> 18:15.886
The worst.
There is zero place for you at Baby Corp.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.679
You are so fired.

18:17.763 --> 18:21.308
You can't. You said you wanted
outside-the-box ideas.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.102
Well, Frankie's got lots.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.103
-Templeton--
-No.

18:24.186 --> 18:28.732
It's Moonboots, the guy who said it was
Vent Babies and nobody believed me.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.651
But was I right?

18:30.734 --> 18:34.279
Yeah, you also said it was
Old Alien Baby Corp from Mars.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.198
And I stand by that.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.201
Nobody in your company
has any imagination.

18:39.284 --> 18:44.123
Here's a baby who does, so why don't you
do something outside the box?

18:44.206 --> 18:46.750
Take a chance on Frankie and her ideas.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.795
[Mega Fat CEO Baby]
Attention, creepy little Vent Baby,

18:49.878 --> 18:53.841
you have one minute to surrender
your creepy little vent self

18:53.924 --> 18:56.718
before security drags you out.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.471
I'm sorry, Tim,
there's nothing I can use there.

18:59.555 --> 19:03.308
No! This is my home!
You can't make me leave!

19:03.892 --> 19:08.438
No, wait! Frankie, come back! Oof! Oof!

19:17.865 --> 19:20.617
-This chick is good.
-We're on her turf.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.829
She must know this whole place
like the back of her hand.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.170
Split up.
Staci, go right. Templeton, left.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.928
-[Frankie gasps]
-Going somewhere?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.307
-End of the line, Frankie.
-[yelps]

19:43.390 --> 19:46.476
These are my vents! I can't leave!

19:46.560 --> 19:48.937
[Mega Fat CEO Baby]
I hear her whiny voice! We're close!

19:49.021 --> 19:53.358
-We can't give Frankie to them.
-Have to do what's best for the company.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.568
[gasps]

19:54.651 --> 19:59.615
I want every vent shaft checked.
We are going to flush this system clean.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.618
Specifically, the "you" part of "we"
are going to do this.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.662
Agh! A hideous failure monster!

20:05.746 --> 20:07.706
Just kidding,
except about every part of that.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.917
Out of the way!
We're tracking a Vent Baby.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.711
Stand down. I've got your Vent Baby here.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.672
-She has a name.
-Just do it, Templeton.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.969
Fabulous. Hah!

20:21.053 --> 20:24.139
Who's captured who now, freaky-freak?

20:26.642 --> 20:27.809
[wheels squeaking]

20:34.608 --> 20:39.696
Don't be sad. We'll dump you on a family.
Maybe they'll let you live in a closet.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.948
You're fired!

20:41.156 --> 20:43.492
[laughing]

20:45.953 --> 20:49.957
Oh, that feels amazing.
Magnus, make me high-five myself.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.212
All clear.

20:55.295 --> 21:01.468
Thank you ever so much, Boss Baby.
But I don't know if I'm ready for this.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.887
Everyone has to change sometime, Frankie.

21:03.971 --> 21:07.557
Welcome to Baby Corp. For real this time.

21:07.641 --> 21:12.104
Thank you, sir.
Stapler and I are gonna make you so proud.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.814
What about the rest of my team?

21:13.897 --> 21:17.276
We had to put something in that decoy.
But don't worry.

21:17.359 --> 21:21.405
I think their first field mission
will be a rousing success.

21:21.488 --> 21:25.951
Well, he's a bear with a diaper face,
but he's ours.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.663
Special formula!

21:29.746 --> 21:33.709
Get your non-contaminated,
keep-you-a-baby-forever formula.

Nuh-uh. I'm never going back.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.435
[regular voice] Aw...!

21:53.603 --> 21:58.984
By the way, I know you're a stapler.
Oh, don't cry.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.068
I'm proud of you.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.989
Letting Frankie join the company
was pretty outside the box, for you.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.950
I made a strategic decision
for the good of the company.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.578
-You liked her ideas?
-All terrible.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.331
Then I remembered Frankie saying
how she always overheard

22:12.414 --> 22:14.291
Mega Fat complain about the budget.

22:14.374 --> 22:17.044
She knows Baby Corp inside and out.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.755
She must have been spying
on everyone for years.

22:19.838 --> 22:23.383
[laughing] I just got my own man
on the inside!

22:23.467 --> 22:26.511
Can you imagine the power plays
I can make with a resource like that?

22:26.595 --> 22:30.599
-Do you ever do anything to be nice?
-[chuckles]

22:30.891 --> 22:34.644
-You'll never know.
-You're right, but I know who might.
