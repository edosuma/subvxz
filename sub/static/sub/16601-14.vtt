JAMIE: <i>We've been riding</i>
<i>together three years,</i>

00:10.142 --> 00:12.109
I'm just finding
out about this now?

00:12.111 --> 00:13.544
'Cause I knew you'd freak out.

00:13.546 --> 00:14.945
There are some things
that just aren't right, Eddie,

00:14.947 --> 00:16.312
and this is one of them.

00:16.315 --> 00:18.649
My grandparents lived in Philly,
and we used to go to the games.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.718
Seriously? The Flyers?

00:20.720 --> 00:21.752
You're not even allowed
to mention that name

00:21.754 --> 00:22.953
in my father's house!

00:22.955 --> 00:24.888
Don't you think you're
overreacting a little bit?

00:24.890 --> 00:25.956
DISPATCHER: All units,
No.

00:25.958 --> 00:27.991
confines of the 12th precinct,

00:27.993 --> 00:29.560
10-13 from the officer.

00:29.562 --> 00:32.262
Officer shot,
east of 52nd and Sutton

00:32.264 --> 00:34.131
Units responding.

00:34.133 --> 00:35.933
(sirens wailing)

00:36.901 --> 00:38.268
(tires screeching)

00:41.473 --> 00:43.607
POLICE OFFICER:
NYPD!

00:43.609 --> 00:45.743
(indistinct chatter)

00:53.985 --> 00:56.086
Anyone down there?

00:56.088 --> 00:58.155
OFFICER: Nothing, Reagan.
We got nothing.

00:58.157 --> 00:59.523
You see anything?

00:59.525 --> 01:02.025
He did say just east of
52nd and Sutton, right?

01:02.027 --> 01:04.161
Yeah, but no RMP,
no partners, no nothing.

01:04.163 --> 01:06.530
(sighs)

01:06.532 --> 01:08.866
What do you think?

01:08.868 --> 01:10.534
(exhales)

01:11.970 --> 01:14.138
Central, slow it down
at this location.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.739
That's gonna be a 10-90X.

01:15.741 --> 01:17.875
No officer down
at this location.

01:17.877 --> 01:19.943
Repeat, no officer down.

01:19.945 --> 01:22.413
I think we got a false alarm.

01:34.492 --> 01:36.527
Hey, don't lean on the car.
Step away.

01:36.529 --> 01:38.028
What do we got?

01:38.030 --> 01:40.864
Two males, both D.O.A.,
multiple gunshot wounds.

01:40.866 --> 01:43.801
Pretty sure the guy on
the ground is Damon Gates.

01:43.803 --> 01:46.437
Looks like he tried
to make a run for it.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.504
Damon Gates. The Godfather

01:47.506 --> 01:49.006
of the Ace Double Treys
Damon Gates?

01:49.008 --> 01:50.441
That's their headquarters
over there.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.943
Gates was coming out
when he got hit.

01:52.945 --> 01:55.045
BAEZ: Anyone
see the shooter?

01:55.047 --> 01:57.448
One guy saw a dark
sedan across the street.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.116
Claims he didn't
see any occupants.

01:59.118 --> 02:00.384
More likely, he wanted
to keep breathing,

02:00.386 --> 02:02.119
given the vics. Thank you.

02:02.121 --> 02:04.488
Gang hit?

02:04.490 --> 02:05.689
It's got to be.

02:05.691 --> 02:07.324
Warrior Kings
and Ace Double Treys

02:07.326 --> 02:08.892
have been going at it
for months.

02:08.894 --> 02:10.259
(sighs)

02:10.262 --> 02:13.530
If the Kings executed
the leader of the ADTs...

02:13.532 --> 02:17.201
Then the ADTs
are gonna hit back. Hard.

GORMLEY: And we had no idea
this was in the works?

02:51.252 --> 02:53.685
My unit had zero Intel Warrior
Kings were taking out Gates.

02:53.687 --> 02:55.954
Because?
"Because?"

02:55.956 --> 02:58.423
Because your unit's
firing on all cylinders?

02:58.425 --> 03:01.093
We've got undercovers inside
both gangs, they had nothing.

03:01.095 --> 03:03.262
This hit came out of left field.

03:03.264 --> 03:04.363
Violence between
the Kings and ADTs

03:04.365 --> 03:05.497
have been escalating for months.

03:05.499 --> 03:06.765
All the more reason

03:06.767 --> 03:08.300
you should've seen this coming.

03:08.302 --> 03:09.635
What we saw were these guys

03:09.637 --> 03:11.103
taking out
each other's soldiers.

03:11.105 --> 03:13.038
So, performing
a community service.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.440
That's bar talk.
I don't want to hear that.

03:16.976 --> 03:19.912
And sooner or later we are going
to have collateral damage,

03:19.914 --> 03:21.280
civilian casualties.

03:21.282 --> 03:24.082
And that is anything
but a community service.

03:24.084 --> 03:25.517
Keep me apprised, Bryce.

03:25.519 --> 03:27.219
Yes, sir.

03:27.221 --> 03:29.188
(sighs)

03:29.190 --> 03:31.456
(door opens, closes)

03:31.458 --> 03:32.724
Helfond's in a tough spot.

03:32.726 --> 03:35.127
Tough spot's pretty much
the job description, Sid.

03:35.129 --> 03:37.696
I meant taking over
from Chief Kent.

03:39.532 --> 03:43.135
Guys like Donald Kent
don't come along every day.

03:43.137 --> 03:46.939
And in Don's case,
they get assassinated for it.

03:50.376 --> 03:52.544
The press is looking for
a statement off the shooting.

03:52.546 --> 03:55.581
Walks like a gang hit,
talks like a gang hit.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.083
The likelihood
of an all-out gang war

03:58.085 --> 03:59.785
on the streets of New York?

04:02.689 --> 04:05.023
Your statement?

04:05.859 --> 04:09.027
Not gonna happen.

04:11.364 --> 04:14.299
(distant siren wailing)

04:14.301 --> 04:16.735
Came up empty on the canvass.
Yeah.

04:16.737 --> 04:18.303
No weapon, no witnesses.

04:18.305 --> 04:20.105
At least, no one
with the balls to talk.

04:20.107 --> 04:22.107
Two guys shot dead
on that crowded block.

04:22.108 --> 04:23.342
Somebody saw something.

04:23.344 --> 04:24.476
You know the rules.

04:24.478 --> 04:25.777
What, no cops?

04:25.779 --> 04:27.246
That rule is meant to be broken.

04:27.248 --> 04:28.614
ADTs don't want the
shooter arrested.

04:28.616 --> 04:29.781
They want him dead.

04:29.783 --> 04:33.051
ADTs want every single King
in the city dead.

04:33.053 --> 04:34.853
That's what they want.

04:34.855 --> 04:38.857
My old boss used to say that
gang wars cut down on paperwork.

04:38.859 --> 04:40.792
Well, look.
Bad guys killing bad guys

04:40.794 --> 04:42.661
is not the worst thing
in the world.

04:42.663 --> 04:45.697
The problem is so many bad guys
have the worst aim in the world,

04:45.699 --> 04:46.999
which is bad for civilians.

04:47.001 --> 04:49.635
And there's always more bangers
to take their place.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.770
High-profile hit like this,
the Kings are gonna do what?

04:51.772 --> 04:53.872
They're gonna use one
of their top soldiers

04:53.874 --> 04:55.107
so they don't screw it up.

04:56.576 --> 04:57.676
See anything?

04:57.678 --> 05:00.279
Couple of these
guys are deceased.

05:00.281 --> 05:02.681
Two are doing time upstate.

05:04.217 --> 05:05.350
Hang on.

05:05.352 --> 05:06.852
Look at this.

05:06.854 --> 05:08.320
Ronald Lloyd.

05:08.322 --> 05:10.722
Released a few months ago
for doing four years

05:10.724 --> 05:12.658
on an attempted murder charge.

05:12.660 --> 05:13.959
I know Ronald Lloyd.

05:13.961 --> 05:16.361
He was a person of interest
in multiple homicides.

05:17.430 --> 05:19.364
Do you think he's our shooter?

05:19.366 --> 05:22.134
I think we're about
to find out.

05:25.772 --> 05:28.240
I just don't understand
why someone is making

05:28.242 --> 05:29.841
these fake radio calls.

05:29.843 --> 05:31.944
Yeah. Boss said
it's been happening

05:31.946 --> 05:33.445
more and more
over the past year.

05:33.447 --> 05:35.547
- Intelligence unit's working on it.
- Any arrests?

05:35.549 --> 05:37.816
No, just been talking to
a bunch of scanner buffs.

05:37.818 --> 05:40.385
Oh, you mean losers who listen
to police calls all day.

05:40.387 --> 05:41.520
I've met some of
these guys. You know,

05:41.522 --> 05:42.621
most of them are harmless.

05:42.623 --> 05:43.956
For them, it's the
ultimate cop show.

05:43.958 --> 05:45.624
Except this is real life for us.

05:45.626 --> 05:46.758
Yeah.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.026
You know, it used
to take some skill to make

05:48.028 --> 05:50.963
a store-bought radio
transmit on a PD frequency.

05:50.965 --> 05:52.397
But now, it's just a lot easier.

05:52.399 --> 05:54.099
Well, then the department
needs to limit access

05:54.101 --> 05:55.500
to our radio channels.

05:55.502 --> 05:57.135
That would cost
the city billions.

05:57.137 --> 05:59.738
Unauthorized transmissions
divert resources,

05:59.740 --> 06:03.575
and they put real victims
in danger, not to mention cops.

06:03.577 --> 06:05.410
And for the few knuckleheads
that make these calls,

06:05.412 --> 06:07.312
it's their idea of a good time.

06:07.314 --> 06:09.181
That's because
they're not risking their lives

06:09.183 --> 06:11.350
answering those calls.

06:26.199 --> 06:29.301
We go in this joint looking for
a fight, we're gonna get one.

06:29.303 --> 06:30.802
Maybe we should call for backup.

06:30.804 --> 06:34.506
Why?
What fun would backup be?

06:34.508 --> 06:36.375
Stay alert.

06:36.377 --> 06:38.577

06:44.283 --> 06:46.685

You're gonna have to do
better than that, Ronald.

10:26.939 --> 10:29.207
I was with Ramirez.

10:29.209 --> 10:30.609
One of your Warrior King
dirtbags?

10:30.611 --> 10:32.177
Eh, not quite.

10:32.179 --> 10:35.380
My parole officer.

10:35.382 --> 10:37.482
So you're saying you were
reporting to your P.O.

10:37.484 --> 10:38.583
at the time of the hit?

10:38.585 --> 10:40.252
Same time every week.

10:40.254 --> 10:42.821
Write down the name
and number of your P.O.

10:42.823 --> 10:43.688
We'll check it out.

10:43.690 --> 10:45.490
Be my guest.

10:45.492 --> 10:47.492
Have at it.

10:47.494 --> 10:48.426
I'm out of here.

10:48.428 --> 10:49.661
Actually, you're not
going anywhere.

10:49.663 --> 10:51.196
We picked you
up in a bar,

10:51.198 --> 10:53.098
where you were associating
with gang members.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.566
That's a parole violation,

10:54.568 --> 10:57.435
so you can sit
your ass down.

10:57.437 --> 10:58.603
You'll cool your jets
in a holding cell

10:58.605 --> 10:59.638
while we visit your P.O.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.239
Can a brother at least
get a coffee?

11:01.241 --> 11:04.442
No, but I'll bring you a knish.

11:05.978 --> 11:07.912
What happened?

11:07.914 --> 11:09.681
We got a double homicide
on Warrior King turf.

11:09.683 --> 11:10.949
Both gang members?

11:10.951 --> 11:13.018
Yeah. Vics were shot,
then had their throats cut.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.386
Signature of
the Ace Double Treys.

11:14.388 --> 11:15.387
Rank?

11:15.389 --> 11:16.554
Not just soldiers.

11:16.556 --> 11:19.190
Collateral damage?

11:19.192 --> 11:19.991
None so far.

11:19.993 --> 11:22.827
In my office.

11:22.829 --> 11:23.862
The mayor called, sir.

11:23.864 --> 11:24.996
In a minute.

11:24.998 --> 11:27.065
The new leader
of the ADTs

11:27.067 --> 11:28.667
is willing to
negotiate a truce.

11:28.669 --> 11:30.302
Willing and able?
Sir?

11:30.304 --> 11:31.569
Is he really the boss

11:31.571 --> 11:33.505
or just saying he is?
Good point.

11:33.507 --> 11:35.073
Multiple sources
confirming.

11:35.075 --> 11:36.675
What about the head
of the Warrior Kings?

11:36.677 --> 11:38.810
Won't play ball.
Well, squeeze 'em.

11:38.812 --> 11:40.912
Threaten to reopen every
murder case he's close to.

11:40.914 --> 11:43.048
That won't work, boss.
Well, make it work.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.983
The leader of the Warrior Kings
is already in prison.

11:44.985 --> 11:48.253
He runs the gang from his cell,
up in Otisville.

11:48.255 --> 11:51.056
It's Mario Hunt.

11:59.065 --> 12:00.598
(sharp exhale)

12:02.301 --> 12:05.570
Landed up in Otisville,
where he took over his gang.

12:08.407 --> 12:10.108
HELFOND: Where he feels free
to stonewall us.

12:10.110 --> 12:11.376
What's that mean?

12:11.378 --> 12:14.779
He put out word he'd take
a sit-down with you...

12:14.781 --> 12:16.848
and only you.

12:24.090 --> 12:26.591
So what you're bringing me--

12:26.593 --> 12:29.027
I'm invited to negotiate
with the man

12:29.029 --> 12:31.563
who murdered my friend
and his wife.

12:31.565 --> 12:34.132
That's my option here.

12:34.134 --> 12:36.201
He can't negotiate
with a guy who killed

12:36.203 --> 12:38.036
an NYPD chief in cold blood.

12:38.038 --> 12:39.504
You get that, right?

12:39.506 --> 12:41.706
What I get, it's my job here
to give our boss the options,

12:41.708 --> 12:43.575
no matter how troubling
those options are.

12:43.577 --> 12:45.510
So you want to kill
the messenger, go ahead.

12:45.512 --> 12:47.746
GORMLEY: Nobody's saying anything about...
Stop.

12:50.149 --> 12:52.117
Set it up.

13:06.633 --> 13:08.262
Ronald Lloyd's been
reporting to me

13:08.263 --> 13:10.097
since his release
from Green Haven.

13:10.099 --> 13:11.431
Keeping his nose clean?

13:11.433 --> 13:13.733
Well, I've never received any
reports to the contrary.

13:13.735 --> 13:16.436
We picked him up at
a Warrior King bar yesterday.

13:16.438 --> 13:17.871
I'll check it out.
If he screwed up,

13:17.873 --> 13:19.539
I'll violate him, and
he can face a parole hearing.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.007
Actually, we're not
looking to put him away

13:21.009 --> 13:22.375
on a parole violation.

13:22.377 --> 13:23.477
So what are we talking about?

13:23.479 --> 13:25.078
We're looking at him
in connection

13:25.080 --> 13:26.680
with a double homicide.

13:26.682 --> 13:27.848
Surprised to hear that.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.916
Ronald seemed determined
to turn his life around.

13:29.918 --> 13:32.752
The leader of the ADT
street gang, and his driver,

13:32.754 --> 13:33.820
were murdered yesterday.

13:33.822 --> 13:35.255
Ronald says he was here
with you

13:35.257 --> 13:36.490
at the time of the murder.

13:36.492 --> 13:37.958
Yeah, Ronald came in
for his scheduled

13:37.960 --> 13:40.193
face-to-face
meeting yesterday.

13:40.195 --> 13:43.463
12:15 p.m. We met for
approximately half an hour.

13:43.465 --> 13:45.198
Gates was hit at 12:30
in Queens.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.933
Which would make it
kind of impossible

13:46.935 --> 13:48.301
for him to kill Gates
at that time.

13:48.303 --> 13:50.537
Looks like Lloyd's not your guy.

14:00.281 --> 14:01.581
Hey, Chris.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.016
How you been?
Officer Reagan.

14:03.018 --> 14:04.217
It's great to see you.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.720
Good to see you.
This is my partner, Eddie Janko.

14:06.722 --> 14:07.854
Hey.

14:07.856 --> 14:09.189
Pleasure.

14:09.191 --> 14:11.224
Hey, your partner tell you
how he saved my business?

14:11.226 --> 14:13.193
No, it was no big deal.

14:13.195 --> 14:14.227
(chuckles):
Come on, man.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.695
I got robbed three months
after I opened.

14:15.697 --> 14:16.997
No insurance.

14:16.999 --> 14:18.331
If Jamie hadn't caught the guys,

14:18.333 --> 14:20.233
located my merchandise,
I'd have had to close down.

14:20.235 --> 14:23.069
Well, I'm glad that
it worked out.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.070
So how is business?

14:24.072 --> 14:26.106
Whole world's
plugged into something.

14:26.108 --> 14:27.841
Keeps me busy.
Yeah, that's why we're here.

14:27.843 --> 14:30.377
We've had a rash of
unauthorized transmissions

14:30.379 --> 14:31.745
over the PD radio.

14:31.747 --> 14:33.146
Yeah, been a lot of chatter
about that on the scanner sites.

14:33.148 --> 14:34.481
Well, it's nothing
to brag about.

14:34.483 --> 14:36.216
Trust me, nobody's bragging.
They're pissed off.

14:36.218 --> 14:37.584
See, 99% of these
scanner buffs,

14:37.586 --> 14:39.653
they just listen
to police calls.

14:39.655 --> 14:41.388
You always get a few trolls.

14:41.390 --> 14:42.756
You know some
of these guys, Chris.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.038
Anybody we should be looking at?

14:46.294 --> 14:48.528
Yeah, this kid-- he's been
in here a few times.

14:48.530 --> 14:50.297
Still in high school.

14:50.299 --> 14:52.432
Calls himself "Shadow."

14:53.668 --> 14:54.968
Major attitude.

14:54.970 --> 14:56.736
Dresses like a punk,
but he's a serious wire-head.

14:56.738 --> 14:58.939
Knows the technology cold.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.473
Do you know
where we could find him?

15:00.475 --> 15:03.877
Cybercafé on 25th.
It's big with the buffs.

15:03.879 --> 15:05.779
Thanks, Chris.
We're gonna check it out.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.314
Anytime.

15:12.753 --> 15:15.989
(siren wailing)

15:30.104 --> 15:31.371
(sighs)

15:31.373 --> 15:33.573
All right, thanks.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.611
Hey.

15:37.613 --> 15:39.913
Ace Double Trey soldiers,
every one of 'em.

15:39.915 --> 15:41.481
Witnesses say the gunman
approached on foot

15:41.483 --> 15:42.882
and opened fire.

15:42.884 --> 15:44.651
DANNY: Let me guess, nobody
got a look at his face.

15:44.675 --> 15:45.419
You got it.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.287
This thing is spinning
out of control.

15:47.289 --> 15:48.755
OFFICER:
Detectives?

15:48.757 --> 15:51.791
We got a fifth victim,
a civilian.

15:51.793 --> 15:54.494
(girl crying)

15:54.496 --> 15:57.297
She's just a baby.
How's she doing?

15:57.299 --> 15:58.865
Took a bullet in her leg,
lost some blood.

15:58.867 --> 16:00.333
Could be worse.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.068
(quivering)

16:02.070 --> 16:04.437
You know, I heard a rumor
that the bravest girl

16:04.439 --> 16:06.373
in all of New York City
is here tonight.

16:06.375 --> 16:09.209
And I think
I just found her.

16:09.211 --> 16:11.711
You stay brave for me, okay?

16:13.281 --> 16:14.614
You, too, Mom.

16:14.616 --> 16:15.782
All right?

16:15.784 --> 16:17.817
Get her out of here.
It's gonna be okay.

16:19.820 --> 16:22.289
(girl sobbing)

16:22.291 --> 16:24.958
It's eight bodies
in 48 hours.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.527
And even if we figure out
who hit Gates,

16:27.529 --> 16:30.030
it's not gonna stop
the bodies from piling up.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.619
(indistinct radio chatter)

16:52.621 --> 16:54.888
Excuse me.

16:56.791 --> 16:59.225
Yo, why are you hassling me?
Are you Shadow?

16:59.227 --> 17:00.894
What about it?
Do yourself a favor,

17:00.896 --> 17:02.896
drop the attitude.
What's your real name?

17:02.898 --> 17:04.864
Tommy O'Rourke,
but I don't go by that.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.635
For a guy who listens
to cop radio 24/7,

17:08.637 --> 17:11.704
you just don't seem
excited to see us, Tommy.

17:11.707 --> 17:13.707
Just 'cause I listen
don't mean I like you guys.

17:13.709 --> 17:14.482
Yeah? What'd we
ever do to you?

17:14.506 --> 17:15.643
You're doing it right now.

17:15.644 --> 17:17.544
Getting in my face
when I didn't do nothing.

17:17.546 --> 17:19.346
That's a really nice radio
you got there.

17:19.348 --> 17:22.214
I bet you could transmit
over the NYPD frequency

17:22.217 --> 17:23.282
with that bad boy.

17:23.285 --> 17:25.285
Yeah, but that's
against the law.

17:25.287 --> 17:27.654
A lady got shot yesterday
because some joker was

17:27.656 --> 17:29.122
making false radio calls.

17:29.124 --> 17:30.557
Well, if you don't want
to get messed with,

17:30.559 --> 17:32.025
then protect your wack system.

17:32.027 --> 17:34.961
Well, it's your lucky day,
Tommy.

17:34.963 --> 17:36.830
Oh, you gonna leave me
the hell alone now?

17:36.832 --> 17:38.565
Better. You're gonna get
to talk to a real live

17:38.567 --> 17:41.434
NYPD detective.
Let's go, get up.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.403
When we get in the car,
we are gonna make

17:43.405 --> 17:46.773
a real live radio call
all about you.

17:50.277 --> 17:51.478
Yeah, all right, thank you.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.214
Nothing on my end.
Lab come up with anything

17:54.216 --> 17:56.049
on the slugs they took out
of Gates and his driver?

17:56.051 --> 17:57.450
Nothing that'll lead us
to the shooter.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.386
I cannot believe we had to cut

17:59.388 --> 18:00.854
that son of a bitch Lloyd loose.

18:00.856 --> 18:02.188
He alibied out, Danny.

18:02.190 --> 18:03.523
Alibied out?
Come on.

18:03.525 --> 18:05.225
This hit was totally his M.O.

18:05.227 --> 18:07.160
Drive-by shooting
with a machine gun

18:07.162 --> 18:08.128
at close range.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.429
"Warrior Kings" in blood

18:09.431 --> 18:12.065
next to the vic's body
on the ground.

18:12.067 --> 18:13.867
We just got to keep digging.

18:13.869 --> 18:15.168
Detectives?

18:15.170 --> 18:17.036
- What?
- This is Peter Chen.

18:17.038 --> 18:18.638
Says he's got
some information

18:18.640 --> 18:19.706
on the Gates homicide.

18:19.708 --> 18:22.375
You don't say.

18:27.448 --> 18:29.416
Thank you.

18:30.885 --> 18:32.786
Okay, Mr. Chen,
what can you tell us?

18:32.788 --> 18:35.188
I was walking to work
when it happened.

18:35.190 --> 18:36.322
Saw the whole thing.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.958
And you're just
coming forward now?

18:38.960 --> 18:40.794
I heard a little girl
got shot today.

18:40.796 --> 18:43.430
These gangs have destroyed
our neighborhood.

18:43.432 --> 18:44.664
What can you tell us
about the shooter?

18:44.666 --> 18:46.599
You get a look at him?
Can you describe him?

18:46.601 --> 18:50.737
Six feet tall, skull earring,

18:50.739 --> 18:52.172
tattoo on his neck
of a bloody knife.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.573
Sound like someone you know?

18:53.575 --> 18:54.607
It can't be him, Danny.

18:54.609 --> 18:56.509
Let's see.
One second.

18:58.979 --> 19:02.015
Okay, Mr. Chen,
do any of these gentlemen

19:02.017 --> 19:04.384
look like the shooter to you?

19:05.986 --> 19:08.455
Number five.
He shot those guys.

19:08.457 --> 19:10.356
Number five.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.058
Are you sure?

19:12.060 --> 19:13.593
That's him.

19:13.595 --> 19:15.028
All right, Mr. Chen,

19:15.030 --> 19:16.362
why don't you have
a seat over there.

19:16.364 --> 19:19.365
We'll be with you
in a moment. Thanks.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.934
How the hell
could Ronald Lloyd

19:20.936 --> 19:23.136
be meeting with his P.O.
and shooting Damon Gates

19:23.138 --> 19:24.471
at the same time?

19:24.473 --> 19:27.807
That is a damn good question.

19:36.984 --> 19:39.452
(lock buzzes)

19:50.464 --> 19:53.199
Appreciate you coming
all the way up here.

20:00.774 --> 20:04.511
I understand you're running
the Warrior Kings now.

20:04.513 --> 20:05.745
I ain't saying that.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.113
I know who I'm talking to.

20:07.115 --> 20:09.916
You ordered the execution
of the head of the ADTs.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.085
He was taking things
that wasn't his.

20:12.087 --> 20:14.053
I don't care how it started.

20:14.055 --> 20:15.321
I want it stopped.

20:15.323 --> 20:17.423
I'm with that.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.492
All this blood's
bad for business.

20:19.494 --> 20:22.362
Then why not come to the table?

20:22.364 --> 20:24.063
Happy to.

20:24.065 --> 20:26.666
(chains rattle)

20:26.668 --> 20:28.701
Long as I come in person.

20:31.872 --> 20:33.773
Look, man,

20:33.775 --> 20:35.909
I got about five more
years up in here.

20:35.911 --> 20:38.111
You get me out,
this war goes away.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.213
I don't have the power
to release a Federal prisoner.

20:40.215 --> 20:42.282
You the most powerful cop
in the whole country.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.717
You make a phone call,
it's done.

20:44.719 --> 20:46.886
You have the power to stop it.

20:46.888 --> 20:49.088
So do you, Frank.

20:49.090 --> 20:53.259
I mean, but the difference
between me and you?

20:53.261 --> 20:57.530
You actually care how many folks
get killed out there.

20:57.532 --> 20:59.532
I don't.

21:00.834 --> 21:01.968
(chains rattle)

21:01.970 --> 21:05.638
Get me the hell out of here.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.014
You have a great
day, Frank.

21:16.016 --> 21:18.251
(lock buzzes)

21:18.253 --> 21:20.453
(gate slams)

21:35.411 --> 21:37.078
Put in the call
to a friend of mine,

21:37.080 --> 21:39.681
a parole supervisor
from Ramirez's office.

21:39.683 --> 21:40.682
Why?

21:40.684 --> 21:42.217
Because something
doesn't add up.

21:42.219 --> 21:43.818
So Ramirez
has to be dirty?

21:43.820 --> 21:45.320
That's not what I said.

21:45.322 --> 21:47.022
You're checking her out
with her boss.

21:47.024 --> 21:49.224
Come on, this is
called police work.

21:49.226 --> 21:52.193
And, as it turns out,
she's recently divorced

21:52.195 --> 21:54.295
and is having serious
money problems.

21:54.297 --> 21:56.798
So you're thinking Ramirez
took cash from Lloyd

21:56.800 --> 21:58.600
to cover his ass
in the Gates homicide?

21:58.602 --> 22:00.502
Wouldn't be the first time
an officer of the law

22:00.504 --> 22:01.936
took the money.

22:01.938 --> 22:04.406
She's been dealing with skels
and gang members for years.

22:04.408 --> 22:05.974
Suddenly, she sells out?

22:05.976 --> 22:08.076
I don't know, but that's what
I'm trying to find out!

22:08.078 --> 22:10.311
I looked into
Ramirez's record.

22:10.313 --> 22:12.981
13 years,
exemplary service.

22:12.983 --> 22:15.250
Okay, so we're just supposed
to assume that Mr. Chen lied

22:15.252 --> 22:16.618
when he I.D.'d Lloyd?

22:16.620 --> 22:18.687
Maybe he made a mistake.

22:18.689 --> 22:20.689
I'd take the word
of a veteran P.O.

22:20.691 --> 22:22.357
over a scared civilian
any day.

22:22.359 --> 22:25.026
Look, I hate jamming up
an officer of the law

22:25.028 --> 22:26.327
as much as you do, okay?

22:26.329 --> 22:27.862
But if that's where
this thing leads us,

22:27.864 --> 22:29.397
that's where I'm going!

22:33.569 --> 22:36.304
Where are you going?

22:53.989 --> 22:56.991
(sighs)
It was taken the day of.

22:59.895 --> 23:01.329
Good to see you, Thomas.

23:01.331 --> 23:02.464
You, too, sir.

23:02.466 --> 23:04.766
I'm glad you transferred
to the gang unit.

23:04.768 --> 23:06.801
Kind of makes it
a family business.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.870
This thing with
the Warrior Kings

23:08.872 --> 23:11.372
and Ace Double Treys,
hell of a mess.

23:11.374 --> 23:13.374
Yes, it is.

23:13.376 --> 23:15.477
So you know
what I'm up against.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.917
(sighs) In exchange
for negotiating a truce,

23:22.919 --> 23:24.853
Mario Hunt is demanding

23:24.855 --> 23:27.956
that we commute
the rest of his sentence.

23:28.791 --> 23:30.792
The guy who killed my parents,

23:30.794 --> 23:32.427
murdered one of your chiefs.

23:32.429 --> 23:36.364
Thomas, a federal judge
has already signed off on it.

23:36.366 --> 23:38.566
You can't.

23:39.368 --> 23:41.369
(sighs, swallows)

23:43.873 --> 23:46.808
(drawer opens, closes)

23:48.477 --> 23:51.012
His blood's not on it,
I washed it off.

23:56.952 --> 24:01.356
But my father's blood is still
on this shield, Commissioner,

24:01.358 --> 24:03.825
in another, just-as-real sense.

24:03.827 --> 24:06.661
I know that.

24:06.663 --> 24:10.431
I like to keep that here
with me.

24:10.433 --> 24:13.001
Your dad always had my back,
I like to think

24:13.003 --> 24:16.237
that in some way, he still does.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.442
But I'm not so sure,
in this instance,

24:21.444 --> 24:24.679
that your dad wouldn't think
what I have to do

24:24.681 --> 24:27.382
is appeasement.

24:28.217 --> 24:29.984
Appeasement's not an option

24:29.986 --> 24:32.086
if you care about
the lives of the innocent.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.090
You sound just like him.

24:36.092 --> 24:40.295
That's just the way he said it.

24:48.170 --> 24:51.406
Just remember you had his trust.

24:51.408 --> 24:54.642
Whatever you have to do,
my dad's got your back.

24:56.879 --> 24:59.480
(sighs)

24:59.482 --> 25:01.616
Thank you, Thomas.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.325
Hey, just talking
to the detectives

25:10.327 --> 25:11.993
who interviewed Shadow.
Is her our guy?

25:11.995 --> 25:14.529
Nope. TARU confirmed that the
unauthorized transmissions

25:14.531 --> 25:15.730
didn't come from his radio.

25:15.732 --> 25:17.031
Did he offer up
any information?

25:17.033 --> 25:19.067
The detective said he wasn't
all that cooperative.

25:19.069 --> 25:22.136
Ooh, there's a shocker.
Right.

25:23.372 --> 25:24.439
Hey.

25:24.441 --> 25:26.274
Hey, Shadow.

25:27.309 --> 25:28.643
Hey, listen.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.046
Sorry we had to bring you in.

25:32.048 --> 25:33.781
- Yeah, right.
- All these false alarms

25:33.783 --> 25:35.683
are gonna get
someone killed.

25:35.685 --> 25:37.018
You know why people
mess with the cops?

25:37.020 --> 25:38.620
'Cause the cops
mess with everyone.

25:38.622 --> 25:39.921
Hey, we got a job to do.

25:39.923 --> 25:41.789
So do your job
and leave me the hell alone.

25:41.791 --> 25:42.590
Hey, and you don't care

25:42.592 --> 25:43.892
if innocent
people get hurt?

25:43.894 --> 25:44.926
They get hurt every day
and you guys

25:44.928 --> 25:46.094
don't do a damn thing
about it.

25:46.096 --> 25:47.362
I guess you're not
paying too close

25:47.364 --> 25:48.596
attention to what's coming
in over that radio.

25:48.598 --> 25:51.366
My older brother got killed
two years ago,

25:51.368 --> 25:54.335
just standing in the street.
Cops didn't do jack.

25:55.271 --> 25:57.305
We're sorry to hear
about your brother.

25:57.307 --> 25:58.640
The thing is hard as we try,

25:58.642 --> 26:00.308
we can't catch everybody.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.644
Can I go now?

26:02.646 --> 26:04.312
Yeah.

26:15.190 --> 26:17.792
I'm not cool with this, Danny.

26:17.794 --> 26:20.194
Staking out a parole officer's
residence...

26:20.196 --> 26:21.829
Okay, well, would you be cool

26:21.831 --> 26:24.232
if Lloyd walked away
from a double murder?

26:24.234 --> 26:25.266
Of course not.

26:25.268 --> 26:26.734
Okay, then we do
what we got to do.

26:26.736 --> 26:29.871
Look, let's talk about
what we know, okay?

26:29.873 --> 26:32.140
My buddy confirmed
that she was divorced.

26:32.142 --> 26:33.141
Is that illegal now?

26:33.143 --> 26:34.208
No, but we also know

26:34.210 --> 26:35.576
she had money problems.

26:35.578 --> 26:38.613
Stopped showing up at work,
started behaving erratically,

26:38.615 --> 26:40.048
according to her friends.

26:40.050 --> 26:42.884
Then suddenly, four months ago,
she's on top of the world.

26:42.886 --> 26:44.352
Right at the exact same time

26:44.354 --> 26:45.954
that Lloyd gets
out of the joint.

26:45.956 --> 26:47.188
Which proves nothing.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.290
Well, does a guy
picking Lloyd

26:49.292 --> 26:51.025
out of a photo array
prove anything?

26:51.027 --> 26:53.061
Eyewitnesses have been
wrong before, Danny.

26:53.063 --> 26:55.897
And so have parole
off... officers.

26:59.101 --> 27:00.401
Well, what do you know?

27:00.403 --> 27:02.303
There's Lloyd.

27:06.508 --> 27:09.444
(camera snapping)

27:12.314 --> 27:13.681
I don't believe it.

27:13.683 --> 27:16.384
Wow.

27:19.421 --> 27:21.489
You were right
about one thing.

27:21.491 --> 27:23.691
He didn't have
to blackmail her.

27:23.693 --> 27:26.361
That guy knows how to
come up with an alibi.

27:40.776 --> 27:41.821
NICKY:
It almost sounds like

27:41.822 --> 27:43.255
they played a bunch
of video games

27:43.257 --> 27:45.690
and decided to go out
and play it in real life.

27:45.692 --> 27:47.225
Or maybe that's
what it sounds like, but...

27:47.227 --> 27:48.393
It's anything but a game.

27:48.395 --> 27:50.695
I'm just saying,
I mean, even the names.

27:50.697 --> 27:51.930
Warrior Kings,

27:51.932 --> 27:53.431
Ace Double Treys?

27:53.433 --> 27:54.466
The names always change,

27:54.468 --> 27:56.234
but that element
seems to stay the same.

27:56.236 --> 27:58.403
Young, hopeless and vicious.

27:58.405 --> 27:59.771
LINDA: If they
catch the guy that

27:59.773 --> 28:01.806
killed Gates, does that mean
the gang war's over?

28:01.808 --> 28:03.508
Well, it's not that easy, Linda.

28:04.377 --> 28:05.610
What do you mean?
What he means is

28:05.612 --> 28:07.946
gangs have their own system
of justice.

28:07.948 --> 28:09.848
And it doesn't include judges
or juries.

28:09.850 --> 28:11.149
Just executioners.

28:11.151 --> 28:12.851
Are they just gonna
keep killing each other?

28:12.853 --> 28:14.019
I'm not worried about them.

28:14.021 --> 28:15.420
ERIN:
How do you broker a deal

28:15.422 --> 28:18.757
between two sides when neither
side respects your authority?

28:19.759 --> 28:21.259
No truce is gonna
stop those animals

28:21.261 --> 28:22.727
from killing one another anyway.

28:22.729 --> 28:24.296
LINDA: We had
an ADT in the ER

28:24.298 --> 28:26.398
last night,
three bullet holes in his chest,

28:26.400 --> 28:27.799
all of 14-years-old.

28:27.801 --> 28:28.733
(groans)

28:28.735 --> 28:30.001
Well, leave a light on.

28:30.003 --> 28:31.536
Ain't the first time
and it won't be the last.

28:31.538 --> 28:33.438
Why would you join a gang if
there's such a high chance

28:33.440 --> 28:34.839
of you getting killed?

28:34.841 --> 28:37.075
For a lot of these guys, gangs
take the place of their family.

28:37.077 --> 28:39.344
Some family.
Pretty sad substitute.

28:39.346 --> 28:40.378
When you don't have anything
to compare it to.

28:40.380 --> 28:41.646
ERIN:
Exactly.

28:41.648 --> 28:42.681
Tough guy on the corner says,

28:42.683 --> 28:43.815
"I'm gonna take care of you"?

28:43.817 --> 28:45.050
For that kid,

28:45.052 --> 28:46.518
he's been waiting
to hear those words

28:46.520 --> 28:47.485
his whole life.

28:47.487 --> 28:48.820
And the next thing you know,

28:48.822 --> 28:50.555
you're in Linda's hospital
with three slugs in you.

28:50.557 --> 28:53.258
And your O.G. Godfather
has no more use for you,

28:53.260 --> 28:54.893
because you can no longer

28:54.895 --> 28:56.595
do his dirty work for him.

28:56.597 --> 28:58.730
How do you negotiate with scum
like that, like Mario Hunt?

28:58.732 --> 29:00.031
JACK:
He was the one

29:00.033 --> 29:01.766
that killed the Kents.
How are you gonna deal with him?

29:01.768 --> 29:04.269
There's no truce
that means anything

29:04.271 --> 29:05.637
without him signing off.

29:05.639 --> 29:07.539
But how, Dad?
You can't cut a deal with him.

29:07.541 --> 29:08.773
I'm gonna try.

29:08.775 --> 29:10.375
But the Kents were your friends.

29:10.377 --> 29:13.044
You bet.
(sighs)

29:13.046 --> 29:15.347
It's complicated, Sean.

29:15.349 --> 29:16.081
Not to me.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.082
Not for me, either.

29:17.084 --> 29:18.984
Mario Hunt should rot
in the prison.

29:18.986 --> 29:20.752
You can't negotiate
with gangbangers.

29:20.754 --> 29:22.320
HENRY:
Just like terrorists.

29:22.322 --> 29:24.189
Not going anywhere.

29:24.191 --> 29:25.490
I wish it were that easy.

29:25.492 --> 29:28.259
I say let 'em work it out
themselves.

29:28.261 --> 29:29.227
And if they don't?

29:29.229 --> 29:30.695
People die.

29:30.697 --> 29:31.963
Innocent people.

29:31.965 --> 29:34.265
Exactly. Innocent people.

29:34.267 --> 29:35.834
Yeah, but if you sit down
with these guys,

29:35.836 --> 29:37.068
then it's like we're giving in

29:37.070 --> 29:38.937
and then you're just asking
for more trouble.

29:38.939 --> 29:39.738
Exactly.

29:39.740 --> 29:40.739
Tell that to the mother

29:40.741 --> 29:42.040
whose little girl got shot.

29:42.042 --> 29:44.676
Tell her we're sorry,
but it's cast in stone

29:44.678 --> 29:47.278
who we will
and will not try to reach.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.747
I'm just saying...

29:48.749 --> 29:50.715
I know what you're saying.

29:53.152 --> 29:55.053
(sighs)

29:58.724 --> 30:00.659
See you next week,
and I don't want to hear

30:00.661 --> 30:02.894
you've been showing up late
for work again.

30:02.896 --> 30:05.296
Ah, you're really hands-on
with these guys, huh?

30:05.298 --> 30:07.532
Well, you have to be or else
they just screw up again.

30:07.534 --> 30:09.234
If they do,
you've got a responsibility

30:09.236 --> 30:10.935
to make sure
they pay for it, right?

30:10.937 --> 30:13.071
That's the job.
What about this?

30:14.573 --> 30:16.641
This part of your job, too?

30:19.278 --> 30:20.979
I don't know what to say.

30:20.981 --> 30:22.914
Well, the state inspector
general has plenty to say.

30:22.916 --> 30:24.115
I never meant for it to happen.

30:24.117 --> 30:25.216
I didn't see Lloyd

30:25.218 --> 30:27.218
twisting your arm
to make it happen last night.

30:27.220 --> 30:29.521
I was in a bad place
when I met Ronald,

30:29.523 --> 30:31.122
but I know it's
not an excuse.

30:31.124 --> 30:32.424
Damn right it's not.

30:32.426 --> 30:34.459
I made a big mistake.

30:34.461 --> 30:36.361
No, you made two mistakes.

30:36.363 --> 30:37.429
First one was
betraying your oath

30:37.431 --> 30:39.130
and sleeping with Lloyd
in the first place.

30:39.132 --> 30:41.099
The second one
was lying to us,

30:41.101 --> 30:42.767
telling us Lloyd was
here when he was out

30:42.769 --> 30:44.069
committing a double homicide.

30:44.071 --> 30:47.172
Also known as hindering
prosecution in the first degree.

30:50.509 --> 30:52.677
You have something to say?

30:55.081 --> 30:59.617
Ronald called me from
your precinct, told me.

30:59.619 --> 31:02.020
He promised
he didn't kill Gates.

31:02.022 --> 31:03.755
We got an eyewitness
says he did.

31:03.757 --> 31:05.824
I swear I never
would've covered for him

31:05.826 --> 31:07.258
if I thought he did
those murders.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.294
You never should've covered
for him at all.

31:10.663 --> 31:12.263
What happens now?

31:12.265 --> 31:15.366
Your career as a P.O.
is finished...

31:15.368 --> 31:17.902
but you could possibly
help yourself on the legal side.

31:20.506 --> 31:21.873
How?

31:21.875 --> 31:23.308
We got to get Lloyd

31:23.310 --> 31:25.477
to confess to killing Gates
and his driver.

31:25.479 --> 31:27.145
How are you gonna get him
to do that?

31:27.147 --> 31:28.413
We won't.

31:28.415 --> 31:30.048
You will.

31:37.890 --> 31:39.824
You wanted to see us, Sarge?

31:39.826 --> 31:41.626
You got a visitor.

31:46.499 --> 31:49.067
Hey, what you doing here,
Shadow?

31:49.069 --> 31:50.468
Look, I was pissed
you dragged me down here

31:50.470 --> 31:53.037
when I didn't do anything,
but I know why you did it.

31:53.039 --> 31:54.172
It was nothing personal.

31:54.174 --> 31:55.740
Yeah, I guess I got a temper.

31:55.742 --> 31:58.143
Yeah, me, too.

31:58.145 --> 32:00.478
Look, I don't always agree
with what you guys do,

32:00.480 --> 32:03.481
but it takes guts, and I'd never
make a false call ever.

32:03.483 --> 32:05.483
That's good to hear.
But there are other guys out

32:05.485 --> 32:07.418
there who do, and they make
the rest of us look bad.

32:07.420 --> 32:09.587
Do you have something
you want to tell us?

32:09.589 --> 32:12.824
I overheard two guys
talking about the robbery

32:12.826 --> 32:14.626
where the lady got shot.
Where was this?

32:14.628 --> 32:16.294
At the cyber cafe
where you guys found me.

32:16.296 --> 32:17.829
They've hung out
there a few times.

32:17.831 --> 32:18.596
What did they say?

32:18.598 --> 32:19.798
Talked about how

32:19.800 --> 32:21.332
it was an easy job,

32:21.334 --> 32:22.433
about the people
in the bank,

32:22.435 --> 32:24.435
like they were there.
Who are these guys?

32:24.437 --> 32:26.237
One of them's a hard-core
radio head named Richie,

32:26.239 --> 32:27.772
and the other guy's
kind of scary.

32:27.774 --> 32:29.207
I definitely wouldn't
mess with him.

32:29.209 --> 32:30.475
Did you mention
these guys

32:30.477 --> 32:32.076
to the detective
that questioned you?

32:32.078 --> 32:33.444
No, he treated me
like a dumb kid,

32:33.446 --> 32:34.746
so that's what I acted like.

32:37.516 --> 32:38.750
Let's go find these guys.

32:52.998 --> 32:54.532
They're coming out.

32:54.534 --> 32:55.934
Copy that.

32:58.637 --> 33:00.805
JANKO:
Excuse me, gentlemen.

33:03.309 --> 33:05.309
Do me a favor, take your hands
out of your pockets.

33:06.145 --> 33:08.479
That's a nice radio.

33:08.481 --> 33:10.315
Afternoon, officers.

33:10.317 --> 33:12.283
We're investigating a bank
robbery a few blocks from here.

33:12.285 --> 33:13.618
You guys know
anything about that?

33:13.620 --> 33:15.320
Nah.

33:16.155 --> 33:17.422
Really?

33:18.224 --> 33:19.324
'Cause you two,

33:19.326 --> 33:21.226
you fit the description
of the perps.

33:23.596 --> 33:25.396
Listen to police calls
on that radio?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.768
(officers shouting)

33:33.105 --> 33:35.240
Hey.

33:37.376 --> 33:39.677
(tires screech)

33:39.679 --> 33:42.113
(grunting)

33:42.115 --> 33:44.515
Gun! I got a gun!

33:44.517 --> 33:46.651
(grunts)
Got him!

33:47.853 --> 33:49.888
JAMIE:
Hands behind your back.

33:49.890 --> 33:51.089
Give me your right hand.

33:55.561 --> 33:58.863
In the car.

33:58.865 --> 34:00.465
I'm willing to bet

34:00.467 --> 34:01.866
that this gun matches the bullet

34:01.868 --> 34:03.368
that they pulled
out of the victim in the bank.

34:03.370 --> 34:06.804
I'm betting this radio is
the unauthorized transmission

34:06.806 --> 34:08.539
that had us chasing our tails.

34:08.541 --> 34:09.908
Pretty nice takedown.

34:09.909 --> 34:11.809
Well, we couldn't have done
it without you, Shadow.

34:11.811 --> 34:12.677
Uh, damn straight.

34:12.679 --> 34:13.945
Ah.

34:13.947 --> 34:16.214
If you're so interested
in the NYPD,

34:16.216 --> 34:17.415
you ever think about joining up?

34:17.417 --> 34:19.284
No, I don't think
I could rock the uniform.

34:19.286 --> 34:21.418
We were thinking about
the Intelligence Division.

34:21.420 --> 34:22.853
They hire civilian analysts.

34:22.856 --> 34:24.155
JANKO:
You know they got internships.

34:24.157 --> 34:26.991
If you're interested,
we'll put in a good word.

34:27.793 --> 34:29.460
I'll think about it.

34:29.462 --> 34:31.663
In the meantime, don't mess up.
I'll be listening.

34:57.656 --> 34:59.057
Hey, what are you
doing here, baby?

34:59.059 --> 35:00.258
I needed to see you.

35:00.260 --> 35:03.061
Come in.

35:08.067 --> 35:09.233
She's in.

35:09.235 --> 35:10.635
Lloyd is smart.

35:10.637 --> 35:12.170
I hope she can pull this off.

35:14.540 --> 35:17.442
It's kind of risky
you being here.

35:17.444 --> 35:18.743
I'm glad to see you.

35:18.745 --> 35:19.811
We need to talk.

35:19.813 --> 35:22.880
Those detectives came
to my office again.

35:22.882 --> 35:25.616
They have a witness who claims
he saw you kill Gates.

35:25.618 --> 35:27.285
Doesn't matter.

35:27.287 --> 35:29.554
Just stick to the story
and we're cool.

35:29.556 --> 35:31.055
RAMIREZ:
There's surveillance video

35:31.057 --> 35:33.624
of everyone who comes in and out
of Corrections, Ronald.

35:33.626 --> 35:36.427
It's just a matter of time
till they ask to see the tape

35:36.429 --> 35:37.695
for the day Gates was killed,

35:37.697 --> 35:38.963
and see you're not on it.

35:38.965 --> 35:40.698
So, just pull the tapes, baby.

35:40.700 --> 35:43.601
I already put my career
on the line for you once.

35:43.603 --> 35:46.404
If I'm gonna do it again
you need to tell me the truth.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.708
Did you kill Gates?

36:00.285 --> 36:03.021
Tell me the truth, Ronald.

36:03.023 --> 36:05.390
It's the only way
I can help you.

36:07.559 --> 36:10.495
Look, I was trying
to protect you, all right?

36:12.064 --> 36:13.464
If you knew
I killed those boys,

36:13.466 --> 36:14.732
you'd have to do
something about it.

36:14.734 --> 36:15.933
Here we go.

36:21.273 --> 36:22.807
Police!

36:22.809 --> 36:24.675
Bitch, you sold me out!
(shouts)

36:24.677 --> 36:26.277
Drop it!

36:26.279 --> 36:28.713
I'll blow her brains out
right here, right now!

36:28.715 --> 36:29.781
You don't want to do that.

36:29.783 --> 36:30.581
Cover me.

36:30.583 --> 36:32.784
Ronald, no!

36:32.786 --> 36:33.434
No!

36:33.458 --> 36:34.768
I'm walking
out of here, all right?

36:34.769 --> 36:37.331
You're leaving here in cuffs
or a body bag, you hear me?

36:37.345 --> 36:38.511
Now put the gun down!

36:38.513 --> 36:40.847
(whimpering)

36:40.849 --> 36:42.382
She dies, it's on you.
(cries)

36:43.117 --> 36:44.284
Drop the gun!

36:44.286 --> 36:46.119
Ronald, listen to me. Hey!

36:46.121 --> 36:47.220
Look at me.

36:47.222 --> 36:48.655
You're a smart guy. Okay?

36:48.657 --> 36:50.757
Why don't you be smart now.

36:50.759 --> 36:54.027
Put that thing down
so nobody gets hurt.

36:54.029 --> 36:55.295
Drop it!

36:55.297 --> 36:56.963
(shouts)

37:08.375 --> 37:10.009
Good job, Christine.

37:15.349 --> 37:16.449
Danny!

37:16.451 --> 37:17.650
Yeah?

37:17.652 --> 37:19.219
5-4 detectives, 10-13.

37:19.221 --> 37:21.221
We have an officer shot
at this location.

37:21.223 --> 37:23.490
DANNY:
Nah, it can't be.

37:23.492 --> 37:25.892
Hey, Ramirez, you
hang in there, okay?

37:25.894 --> 37:29.028
Guess I was wrong about him.

37:30.331 --> 37:33.633
DANNY:
Ramirez? Ramirez!

37:51.986 --> 37:54.988
Wasn't easy getting the feds
to sign off on your release.

37:54.990 --> 37:56.589
They stuck my ass in Vermont.

37:56.591 --> 37:59.092
I don't ski
and I don't make candles.

37:59.094 --> 38:02.128
I hit the streets.
You get your truce.

38:02.130 --> 38:04.063
Everybody wins.

38:04.065 --> 38:06.933
Well... almost everybody.

38:06.935 --> 38:07.967
Okay, don't do that.

38:07.969 --> 38:09.869
Don't go comparing
what you've lost to...

38:09.871 --> 38:11.404
to what I've lost.

38:11.406 --> 38:14.474
My old man wasn't
no chief of police.

38:14.476 --> 38:15.775
I never knew my old man.

38:15.777 --> 38:18.545
Matter of fact, I had to fight
for everything I ever got.

38:18.547 --> 38:20.513
You didn't fight for it.
You stole for it.

38:20.515 --> 38:22.515
You lied for it.
You murdered for it.

38:22.517 --> 38:23.683
Don't flatter yourself.

38:23.685 --> 38:26.519
Whatever, man. Just get me
the hell up out of here.

38:26.521 --> 38:29.989
(sighs)
Well...

38:33.594 --> 38:34.994
...that's not gonna happen.

38:34.996 --> 38:36.329
No?
No.

38:36.331 --> 38:38.198
That's how you want to play it?

38:38.200 --> 38:40.900
Okay, then when the bodies keep
on dropping, that's on you.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.569
There's a new deal.

38:42.571 --> 38:46.773
I picked up the phone and got
you transferred to USP Atlanta.

38:46.775 --> 38:49.876
You... can't do that.

38:49.878 --> 38:53.346
No, I can't, but the feds can.

38:53.348 --> 38:57.150
I understand the Ace Double
Treys run things in Atlanta.

38:57.152 --> 38:59.519
Cops ain't supposed to have
people murdered, Frank.

38:59.521 --> 39:01.521
In a perfect world, Mario.

39:01.523 --> 39:03.957
But this ain't
a perfect world.

39:05.092 --> 39:06.059
Here's the deal.

39:06.061 --> 39:07.660
The war stops now.

39:07.662 --> 39:10.997
You can finish your sentence
here, in your house.

39:10.999 --> 39:15.235
If not, it's Atlanta,
in their house.

39:17.771 --> 39:20.673
The offer's good
for the next ten seconds.

39:30.784 --> 39:33.887
Just when things were going
so well for you.
