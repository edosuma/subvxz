WEBVTT

00:02.780 --> 00:06.840
If we close our eyes, perhaps we can smell cedar,

00:07.160 --> 00:09.370
Black currant and,

00:10.360 --> 00:12.590
A hint of moss?

00:12.990 --> 00:15.940
Sorry. I had no idea it was going to be this dry.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.560
The wine or the lecture?

00:18.110 --> 00:19.040
You there, 

00:19.540 --> 00:22.230
Is there something you want to 
share with the rest of the class?

00:22.350 --> 00:25.200
Just how much we love this zinfandel,
particularly the... 

00:25.560 --> 00:27.080
Mossiness. 

00:27.500 --> 00:29.410
I'm glad you approve.

00:29.540 --> 00:32.430
We'll now move on to the cabernet.

00:35.220 --> 00:37.680
As you can see, the acidity is more modest.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.290
Tastes a little arrogant to me.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.790
Is there something amusing about the cabernet?

00:43.070 --> 00:45.030
No. I'll buy a case. 

00:45.140 --> 00:46.180
Two cases.

00:46.290 --> 00:48.620
What the hell. How much for everything?

00:49.670 --> 00:52.380
See the look on his face? He was gonna have us arrested.

00:52.530 --> 00:54.680
Perhaps if you weren't always getting us in trouble.

00:55.060 --> 00:56.420
Not always.

00:56.810 --> 00:58.970
On saturday you got us thrown out of the museum.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.470
Well,why have a big bed like that 
If you don't want people to test it out? 

01:02.590 --> 01:04.000
It belonged to queen victoria.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.200
You didn't also buy the museum,did you?

01:06.300 --> 01:07.780
I did think about it.Would have been worth it

01:07.900 --> 01:09.930
just to do it with you on that bed.

01:10.750 --> 01:11.730
Too forward? 

01:11.820 --> 01:12.810
I like forward.

01:12.920 --> 01:16.040
Truth be told,these last three dates 
have been an exercise in not 

01:16.600 --> 01:18.190
Ripping your clothes off. 

01:18.300 --> 01:19.560
Well,what's been stopping you?

01:19.740 --> 01:22.420
Well,it's not like we know each other all that well.

01:22.570 --> 01:24.130
So where did you grow up?

01:24.650 --> 01:26.800
Paris and geneva.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.730
First pet?

01:31.460 --> 01:33.470
Uh,chewbacca. 

01:33.580 --> 01:35.850
He was a goldfish. First,uh,boyfriend?

01:35.970 --> 01:38.290
Xavier smith,a duke.

01:38.630 --> 01:39.980
A duke?

01:40.090 --> 01:43.080
Oh,yeah,or a viscount. Don't get too insecure.
he stunk in bed.

01:43.830 --> 01:45.170
College?

01:45.430 --> 01:48.030
Sarah lawrence,b.u.,

01:48.210 --> 01:49.900
Johnson & wales... 

01:50.810 --> 01:53.980
Emerson,a semester at sea.

01:54.220 --> 01:55.830
I get restless.

01:56.530 --> 01:57.330
You?

01:58.530 --> 02:00.840
U.c.l.a.,stanford law.

02:00.940 --> 02:03.620
Smarty-pants. Sexy.

02:32.050 --> 02:34.340
...fully solar-powered automobile

02:34.450 --> 02:37.150
Combing all of the qualities you've come to expect

02:37.250 --> 02:38.530
From zyre-- 

02:38.630 --> 02:41.800
Superior technology, unparalleled luxury.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.720
The heliospy zyre-- 

02:43.810 --> 02:45.790
New for 2049.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.420
Step into the light.

02:48.530 --> 02:50.820
how a single invention can change the world,

02:50.980 --> 02:57.260
That she would be the one to give us 
the greatest invention of the 21st century--

02:57.800 --> 03:01.770
Cold fusion, the miracle that gives us safe,

03:01.910 --> 03:03.550
Renewable,

03:03.690 --> 03:06.820
Waste-free nuclear energy.

03:06.920 --> 03:11.300
Today i have the honor of announcing 
this year's nobel peace prize--

03:11.390 --> 03:14.280
My friend,our inspiration--

03:14.440 --> 03:16.620
Genny clarke.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.800
Congratulations.

03:22.910 --> 03:23.880
What are you doing? 

03:24.750 --> 03:25.770
What? 

03:26.430 --> 03:27.800
I'm,uh...

03:28.200 --> 03:31.500
I'm clapping... At you,'cause... 

03:31.980 --> 03:33.580
'Cause you look so good.

03:34.630 --> 03:36.880
At 6:20 in the morning with no makeup?

03:37.010 --> 03:39.360
Yeah. You look amazing.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.520
I mean,seriously,one of the top ten nights of my life.chen? 

03:42.620 --> 03:45.350
Which part of "waiting room" you no understand?

03:45.860 --> 03:48.750
Very sorry. This patient have problem with brain.

03:48.860 --> 03:51.300
It's broken, and dr. Chen can no fix.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.630
What that?

03:52.740 --> 03:55.180
They were giving away free chai lattes at the eastern wellness clinic 

03:55.310 --> 03:56.510
Down the block. You want some? 

03:56.620 --> 03:58.640
Was it crowded? - Yeah. 

03:59.310 --> 04:03.640
Dr. Lee probably using two-for-one deal on ancient chinese medicine. 

04:03.770 --> 04:05.080
- who's dr. Lee? 
- hack. 

04:05.190 --> 04:08.500
No moral fiber. We study under nurhachi together.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.300
Nurhachi, the dark arts guy?

04:12.330 --> 04:14.430
Say it a little louder,why don't you?

04:14.610 --> 04:15.650
What are you doing here anyway? 

04:15.760 --> 04:18.470
I just wanted to say thank you for the ashley introduction.

04:18.579 --> 04:19.779
She's amazing. 

04:20.130 --> 04:21.399
You got laid.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.030
About time,bro.

04:23.140 --> 04:24.820
Thanks. I mean, it's pretty great.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.100
I-- for the first time since the sold-out 

04:27.210 --> 04:29.060
George michael concert in my living room,

04:29.180 --> 04:30.140
I'm a regular guy. 

04:30.270 --> 04:31.600
- Except for the fact you're not. 
- i know. 

04:32.780 --> 04:37.420
Hey,a woman from the future got given 
the nobel peace prize outside my apartment today.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.350
I got patti researching it already.

04:39.460 --> 04:41.610
I just-- i wanted to say thank you.

04:41.820 --> 04:44.100
I owe you one,yeah.

04:45.110 --> 04:49.120
- you can pay dr. Chen back by making appointment for change! 
- yeah.

04:51.630 --> 04:54.870
Hey! How's it going finding future nobel laureate genny clarke? 

04:54.990 --> 04:56.950
About how you'd expect it to go with 29 genny,

04:57.050 --> 04:59.100
Jennifer and j. Clarkes all in the bay area.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.140
That's 29 unbelievably awkward phone calls.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.470
Let me narrow it down for you. 

05:03.570 --> 05:06.490
Uh,genny would be in her early 20s and some sort of physicist.

05:06.590 --> 05:08.760
Oh,that narrows it right down.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.840
You look beautiful today,patti. That color s-suits you.

05:14.060 --> 05:17.600
Oh! You finally got yourself some.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.860
I was wondering if you'd taken a vow of chastity.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.790
Just find genny for me, okay?

05:22.940 --> 05:25.750
He got hisself some.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.740
Have you thought about my offer?

05:27.870 --> 05:29.810
- for a full three seconds. 
- daddy.

05:29.950 --> 05:31.890
You're not asking for a pony,taylor.

05:32.010 --> 05:35.470
No amount of "daddy" can convince me to 
let you represent me in my divorce.

05:35.580 --> 05:37.040
I'd sooner represent myself 

05:37.140 --> 05:39.000
Than let my daughter sue her own stepmother. 

05:39.120 --> 05:41.400
At least then your would be discreet.

05:41.530 --> 05:43.310
Look,i don't think you want everyone knowing

05:43.410 --> 05:45.550
How much the new firm is costing you personally. 

05:45.660 --> 05:47.880
Diane cuthbert is the very soul of discretion.

05:47.990 --> 05:49.910
And i've beat her in court at least six times.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.960
Look,i'm sorry to have to play this card,

05:52.060 --> 05:54.080
But i'm starving,and i'm moody,

05:54.180 --> 05:55.880
And my pants are being held together by a rubber band.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.050
Now you call diane and tell her i'm taking over,

05:58.170 --> 05:59.500
Or no baby pictures for you. 

05:59.600 --> 06:01.420
Okay. Calm down.

06:01.530 --> 06:03.800
That's right,dad. Fear the hormones. 

06:04.460 --> 06:06.950
Eli,is there a nobel prize in googling?

06:07.060 --> 06:07.760
You foi unstd onheer? 

06:07.860 --> 06:11.390
Jennifer ann clarke got her degree in molecular biology at princeton. 

06:11.510 --> 06:13.650
I'm not licensed to practice law in new jersey.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.140
You sure there's no one local?

06:15.260 --> 06:19.190
Well,there's a gennelle clarke living in plainview,

06:19.300 --> 06:20.830
But she's not exactly a physicist.

06:20.930 --> 06:23.870
She's a college dropout who works at the workbench,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.590
The home improvement store.

06:28.310 --> 06:30.040
Maybe i have the wrong address. 

06:30.150 --> 06:31.010
I'm looking for genny clarke.

06:31.130 --> 06:33.380
What,am i late on my netflix bill or something?

06:33.530 --> 06:34.880
No,i...

06:35.220 --> 06:37.920
Is there any reason that,you might need an attorney?

06:38.040 --> 06:40.710
Aside from some dorky guy in a suit harassing me?

06:40.810 --> 06:41.740
Right.

06:43.190 --> 06:45.800
Okay. Uh,looks like i'm on my way to new jersey.

06:45.930 --> 06:47.620
Sorry to trouble you.

06:48.590 --> 06:49.880
Oh,my god. Who are you? 

06:49.980 --> 06:51.130
What did you tell them?

06:53.780 --> 06:55.160
What's going on?

06:55.310 --> 06:56.310
Gennelle clarke? 

06:56.430 --> 06:57.290
Tommy lee jones?

06:57.430 --> 06:59.130
Placing you under arrest, ms. Clarke.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.830
You have the right to remain silent.

07:00.970 --> 07:02.330
You have the right to an attorney. 

07:02.420 --> 07:03.540
She has one. It's me. 

07:03.630 --> 07:04.680
What's she being charged with?

07:04.780 --> 07:06.580
Alleged terrorist activity.

07:06.700 --> 07:07.660
-  what? 
- come on. 

07:07.770 --> 07:09.780
She doesn't exactly look like john walker lindh.

07:09.890 --> 07:13.580
That didn't stop her from building a nuclear bomb in her backyard.

07:14.650 --> 07:17.800

07:28.810 --> 07:29.870
**(thanks for coming)

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Hey,no problem. I was just thinking 

07:31.110 --> 07:33.050
How my day could use a good body cavity search.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.110
What's this?

07:37.270 --> 07:38.740
I thought we represent a terrorist. 

07:38.870 --> 07:41.240
Accusedterrorist,falsely.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.550
- the f.b.i. found some nuclear materials at her home. 
- what? 

07:44.680 --> 07:46.780
All legal purchases from a place called the workbench.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.640
So what,you get a 10% employee discount on yellowcake uranium? 

07:49.750 --> 07:51.170
Hilarious.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.870
Let's see. Uh, "she had in her possession 
hundreds of smoke detectors,

07:54.990 --> 07:57.660
- Glow-in-the-dark clocks."  
- Nothing illegal about that.

07:58.580 --> 08:02.050
"most had been dissected of heir radioactive materials."

08:02.660 --> 08:04.450
That's illegal. 

08:04.920 --> 08:07.280
Throw in a charge of attempting to 
build a weapon of mass destruction,

08:07.390 --> 08:09.850
And i think she's relocating off the coast of cuba.

08:09.950 --> 08:11.310
I was not building a bomb. 

08:11.440 --> 08:12.240
We know. 

08:12.350 --> 08:15.250
You're working on developing a safe form of nuclear energy...

08:16.970 --> 08:18.380
Cold fusion.

08:19.950 --> 08:21.570
Cold fusion?

08:22.330 --> 08:23.380
That'd be pretty major.

08:23.510 --> 08:25.370
So major that whoever was working on it

08:25.500 --> 08:27.590
Probably wouldn't want to talk about it.

08:27.690 --> 08:29.240
Or they're a whack job,

08:29.360 --> 08:31.650
Which is why they're working in a shed 
instead of a lab in the first place. 

08:31.750 --> 08:33.909
He's right,which means you'll have to testify.

08:34.030 --> 08:35.600
Sure,i'll testify... 

08:35.740 --> 08:38.470
When pigs can fly faster than the speed of light-- 

08:38.580 --> 08:41.510
In effect,slowing time so that when they return to earth,

08:41.600 --> 08:43.789
They'll find out that hell has frozen over.

08:44.550 --> 08:46.410
Our problems are solved.

08:50.170 --> 08:51.100
By otters? 

08:51.270 --> 08:52.290
Sea otters.

08:52.410 --> 08:54.430
This is the perfect charity for you to champion.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.780
Look,aren't they cute?

08:55.880 --> 08:58.030
The population's been declining for years.

08:58.180 --> 09:02.010
Many blame the oil pollution. 
So it's great p.r. for you to--

09:02.100 --> 09:03.150
I'm not interested in p.r.,maggie.

09:03.260 --> 09:05.640
All i want is to take some of the money my father made

09:05.760 --> 09:08.520
From raping the environment and give it back to the environment.

09:10.770 --> 09:13.150
I didn't know environmental rape was funny.

09:13.330 --> 09:15.590
A text message from this guy i'm dating.

09:15.710 --> 09:17.950
Wants to take me to dinner tonight. Let me just...

09:19.510 --> 09:23.210
Uh,so,mags,you know how you used to work at wethersby,

09:23.320 --> 09:25.900
Posner & klein before it was just posner & klein? 

09:26.010 --> 09:26.720
Yeah.

09:26.860 --> 09:29.220
Did you know this guy there-- eli stone? 

09:29.340 --> 09:30.420
Of course. Why?

09:30.530 --> 09:32.060
He's the guy i'm dating.

09:32.710 --> 09:35.080
That's great. So great.

09:35.170 --> 09:37.300
No,he-- he's great.

09:37.450 --> 09:39.390
Are you guys,um,serious?

09:39.500 --> 09:42.300
Please. I don't even commit to 
a pair of shoes fomore than a month.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.990
I don't do serious. But he's fun...

09:46.120 --> 09:48.850
Or was fun until this morning.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.330
What happened?

09:50.760 --> 09:52.910
So i'm fast asleep.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.070
At your house? By yourself?

09:55.250 --> 09:56.530
His. 

09:56.650 --> 09:59.050
When i hear this clapping from the terrace.

09:59.260 --> 10:02.930
I go ****(out and there's eli) in his underwear applauding.

10:04.110 --> 10:05.770
Now don't get me wrong. I'm good in bed,

10:05.890 --> 10:08.660
But i have never gotten a standing ovation before.

10:08.780 --> 10:11.140
Maybe... It was--

10:11.250 --> 10:12.660
A side effect of his aneurysm? 

10:12.780 --> 10:13.630
He told you that?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.680
Maggie,it was all over the local news last year.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.900
Right,yeah. 

10:17.440 --> 10:20.610
Did he... Tell you anything else?

10:20.720 --> 10:21.880
There's more?

10:21.980 --> 10:25.710
Eli's just...a little different.

10:25.830 --> 10:27.990
He's... He's special.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.400
Well,i'm not sure i'm so into special,

10:30.510 --> 10:33.610
But i'm not bored yet, and he is cute

10:33.830 --> 10:36.850
And quite enthusiastic between the sheets.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.630
I think i'll keep him around a little longer.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.140
You can't be serious.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.470
My client's financial circumstances have changed.

10:46.590 --> 10:48.690
This may sound greedy to you, taylor,

10:48.800 --> 10:50.530
But jordan changed.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.450
You admitted it yourself. 
You're not the same man i married.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.430
You don't care about the things he did--

10:55.610 --> 11:00.670
Our house,our possessions, our social obligations...me.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.550
Do you have any idea what that's like?

11:03.680 --> 11:06.070
Ellen,i'm sincerely sorry.

11:06.220 --> 11:08.060
I never intended to hurt you.

11:08.180 --> 11:10.000
I just want to keep the life i know--

11:10.100 --> 11:12.190
The club,the house,our friends. 

11:12.290 --> 11:13.650
Those things cost money,ellen,

11:13.780 --> 11:15.350
The kind of money he doesn't have anymore.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.690
Mrs. Wethersby and your client had an implicit understanding

11:17.810 --> 11:20.050
About the lifestyle he was offering when she married him.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.720
If he wants to lifestyle up,that's fine.

11:21.830 --> 11:22.890
But it's not hermidlife cris. 

11:23.000 --> 11:24.210
She's supposed to support his decisions.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.840
And he's supposed to support her,

11:25.940 --> 11:27.300
Which is why as well as the house,

11:27.500 --> 11:30.000
We're seeking alimony in this amount.

11:33.570 --> 11:35.260
You might want to inform your client

11:35.350 --> 11:36.880
That she didn't marry a saudi prince. 

11:37.030 --> 11:38.370
It's what she deserves.

11:38.550 --> 11:40.120
Thank you.

11:42.550 --> 11:45.930
We'll take your request under advisement 
and reconvene later in the week.

11:46.040 --> 11:50.360
In the meantime,i'll advise my client of 
his legal rights as well as his common sense.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.730
On a personal note... 

11:53.430 --> 11:54.900
I'm ashamed of you.

11:55.070 --> 11:58.220
Until you've walked in my shoes, 
You have no right to judge me.

11:58.340 --> 12:02.150
Fine. I'll have my father buy me a pair of 
$600 chanel flats before our next meeting.

12:04.300 --> 12:08.360
Central location, views of downtown, ice cream store downstairs.

12:08.890 --> 12:10.770
This might be a good time to remind you that i'm the guy

12:10.880 --> 12:12.710
That got the hostal to pay you all that money. 

12:12.810 --> 12:14.070
Best thing that ever happened to me.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.640
Now when i get out of bed in the morning, 
i'm actually excited. 

12:17.310 --> 12:21.240
There's nothing better than a life change 
that isn't aneurysm-motivated.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.320
Oh,my god.

12:26.700 --> 12:29.010
You finally let the little attorney out of his briefs. 

12:29.130 --> 12:31.180
Oh, you read the ad i took out?

12:31.930 --> 12:34.190
Things are going pretty good with ashley,huh?

12:34.320 --> 12:37.380
It's like the man upstairs made a book keeping error in my favor.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.180
You're gonna have to tell beth all about it 
when you come to dinner. 

12:40.290 --> 12:41.100
You're still comin',right? 

12:41.210 --> 12:42.960
Of course. Oh,wait a second.

12:46.530 --> 12:50.750
Where is my brother, and why has he been 
replaced by a 12-year-old girl?

12:50.860 --> 12:52.460
Why did i never text before, hmm?

12:53.070 --> 12:54.240
Have you told her? 

12:54.380 --> 12:55.900
She knows about the aneurysm.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.260
What about the george michael-lovin',

12:58.360 --> 13:00.380
Talkin'- to-god weirdo part?

13:00.900 --> 13:03.100
I was thinking of telling her tonight in fact

13:03.820 --> 13:05.830
You know,eli,i'm not sure that's such a good idea.

13:05.940 --> 13:07.620
I'm not ashamed of it anymore,nate.

13:08.110 --> 13:10.700
I want to start our relationship without any secrets.

13:10.890 --> 13:14.650
So you're telling me that i you're like... Spider-man?

13:15.030 --> 13:18.670
Um,except i don't catch super villains.

13:18.770 --> 13:20.380
I win trials.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.330
Because the visions tell you what cases to take.

13:23.450 --> 13:25.160
See? You get it already.

13:25.300 --> 13:29.090
I mean,some people-- you have to explain that a couple of times.

13:34.390 --> 13:38.960
But some people,think it's a gift.

13:40.180 --> 13:42.340
Jewelry is a gift.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.520
You just told me you work for god.

13:47.740 --> 13:49.540
I shouldn't have told you.

13:49.940 --> 13:53.480
I thought that you would think it was weird in a cool way, but,

13:55.360 --> 13:57.380
Horrified i wasn't prepared for.

13:57.490 --> 13:59.770
I'm not horrified.i'm just a little... 

14:02.070 --> 14:06.170
Overwhelmed.it's...a lot.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.150
What are the chances that you forget all about this

14:11.270 --> 14:14.140
Without getting hit over the head with something heavy?

14:23.450 --> 14:25.430
Dude,what did i tell you about the barging?

14:25.570 --> 14:27.170
Sorry. You with a patient?

14:27.270 --> 14:28.460
Sadly,no.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.460
Good,'cause this is an emergency.

14:30.580 --> 14:32.670
Just wading through my ever-enlarging stack of bills. 

14:32.780 --> 14:36.240
I told ashley about my visions,and she call me "special."

14:36.770 --> 14:38.010
That's not a good sign. 

14:38.140 --> 14:39.460
You can't just drop a bomb like that.

14:39.560 --> 14:40.670
Well,why did you set me up with somebody

14:40.780 --> 14:42.400
Who wouldn't be open to knowing the whole truth about me? 

14:42.500 --> 14:45.730
because no one sane would be open to that after four dates,eli. 

14:45.830 --> 14:47.500
- grace was. 
- she doesn't count. 

14:47.650 --> 14:49.570
She was a female you.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.310
I set you up with ashley because 
she's the opposite of you.

14:52.420 --> 14:53.910
The opposite of me? 

14:54.000 --> 14:55.460
Yes. Fun.

14:55.590 --> 14:58.070
Let me clarify. 
What i'm after here is some advice on 

14:58.170 --> 15:00.960
How to make ashley not think of me as a complete nut job.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.710
Then go back in time and don't tell her.

15:03.810 --> 15:05.230
And while you're back there,

15:05.330 --> 15:07.050
Tell me not to go into the smoothie business.

15:07.170 --> 15:08.350
Waste of money,that was. 

15:08.460 --> 15:10.570
You're cra*** and more unhelpful than usual.

15:10.690 --> 15:12.490
Things really that bad with the practice? 

15:12.590 --> 15:13.520
They're not good.

15:13.660 --> 15:16.210
Meanwhile,dr. Lee has got a line around the block.

15:16.310 --> 15:18.620
Well,maybe dr. Lee gives better dating advice than you do.

15:18.740 --> 15:22.680
Or because dr. Lee actually charges 
the crackpots who come in looking for it. 

15:25.280 --> 15:27.630
Ellen knows how vulnerable my dad is right now.

15:27.740 --> 15:29.610
He's under so much stress.

15:29.780 --> 15:31.930
It's-- it's one thing that she filed for divorce.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.900
It's another thing that sheid it to him now.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.790
What do you think? 

15:36.170 --> 15:37.570
This makes me look fat,right?

15:37.660 --> 15:39.590
No,i think it's the pregnancy that does that.

15:40.120 --> 15:43.530
But the pregnancy also makes you... Glow.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.290
I look like a boat.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.780
A beautiful pregnant boat.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.430
So what do you think i should do? 

15:51.540 --> 15:52.930
Uh,about the dress?

15:53.050 --> 15:55.640
- About ellen.  - Oh. I don't know.

15:55.740 --> 15:57.420
Couple times i met her, she seemed pleasant enough,

15:57.530 --> 15:59.780
And i always thought you two had a great relationship. 

16:00.050 --> 16:02.100
We had fine relationship.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.050
We've been perfectly friendly and civil for 20 years,

16:05.150 --> 16:07.350
But it's not like she ever replaced my mother.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.560
Oh,you mean the woman who abandoned you when you were 14.

16:09.690 --> 16:10.980
Shut up. 

16:11.620 --> 16:13.070
I look like a fire hydrant.

16:13.170 --> 16:15.220
A beautiful, pregnant fire hydrant.

16:16.230 --> 16:19.130
All i'm saying is you've known this woman for 20 years.

16:19.260 --> 16:22.380
If she's being so unreasonable, 
don't drag it out in court.

16:22.510 --> 16:24.570
Don't humiliate her or your dad. 

16:24.680 --> 16:26.160
Just go talk to her,you know?

16:26.280 --> 16:27.880
Work something out.

16:32.860 --> 16:34.570
You know, i hate it when you're right.

16:34.690 --> 16:36.690
That's why i rarely am.

16:37.490 --> 16:40.920
After a tip from one of her co-workers,
we went to the defennt's home--

16:41.030 --> 16:43.220
Specifically,the trailer park where she lives.

16:43.330 --> 16:46.130
We had a search warrant properly issued 
under the p.a.t.r.i.o.t. act. 

16:46.250 --> 16:48.660
And what, if anything,did your search uncover?

16:48.750 --> 16:49.990
A lead-lined shed. 

16:50.100 --> 16:53.690
Inside we found hundreds of smoke alarms 
and glow-in-the-dark clocks,

16:53.790 --> 16:56.560
All of which had been stripped of their nuclear materials. 

16:56.650 --> 16:58.070
And in your expert opinion,

16:58.160 --> 17:00.360
Why would someone isole nuclear material like that?

17:00.460 --> 17:04.890
The only purpose would be for the construction 
of a radiological dispersal device

17:05.550 --> 17:08.060
Colloquially known as a dirty bomb.

17:12.859 --> 17:16.810
Usually a dirty bomb combis radioactive material

17:16.920 --> 17:19.619
With conventional explosive devices.

17:19.730 --> 17:23.560
- When you searched my client's shed,did you find any such devices? 
- No.

17:23.690 --> 17:26.050
Did you find any plans or diagrams 

17:26.150 --> 17:30.060
Or journal entries which included schematics 
for building such a bomb? 

17:30.490 --> 17:31.180
No.

17:31.310 --> 17:32.440
But you did find her notebk. 

17:32.550 --> 17:34.310
We find a spiral notepad 

17:34.450 --> 17:37.060
With crude mathematical formulas and diagrams.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.070
Sounds threatening. 

17:38.170 --> 17:40.040
Our experts are still going over the notations.

17:40.140 --> 17:42.580
So it's possible genny was working on something else,

17:42.680 --> 17:45.360
Something beneficial to the world,

17:45.460 --> 17:47.350
Like experiments on nuclear energy?

17:47.460 --> 17:50.130
She is a 22-year-old college dropout

17:50.240 --> 17:51.850
Who is a cashier at workbench. 

17:51.930 --> 17:54.890
Einstein developed his theory of relativity 
while working as a patent clerk. 

17:54.990 --> 17:57.130
Einstein didn't expose his neighbors,

17:57.230 --> 17:58.520
Nor certainly himself, 

17:58.620 --> 18:00.280
To significant physical harm 

18:00.390 --> 18:05.270
By having unlicensed, 
illegal nuclear materials in his backyard. 

18:05.360 --> 18:08.070
I know exactly stick those nuclear materials.

18:08.180 --> 18:10.060
Yeah,i don't think that'll help your case.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.620
As it is,the jury sees you as the female ted kaczynski. 

18:12.710 --> 18:14.010
Kaczynski? That guy was a hack.

18:14.090 --> 18:15.490
Have you ever seen his work? Shoddy. 

18:15.610 --> 18:18.200
Genny, the problem here is,unless you take the stand,

18:18.320 --> 18:21.830
The jury is not gonna think of you 
as anything other than a cckpot. 

18:21.940 --> 18:23.290
I don't care what people think.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.300
Well,you should,'cause these 12 people can put you in prison.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.390
And i think you do care what people think.

18:29.510 --> 18:31.800
Otherwise you wouldn't be so scared.

18:33.490 --> 18:35.240
But you don't have to be. Look, 

18:35.930 --> 18:38.160
You have a brilliant mind,

18:38.460 --> 18:40.410
A once-in-a-generation mind.

18:40.680 --> 18:43.860
You just have to let people see it.

18:51.580 --> 18:53.610
I'm not wearing a dress.

18:55.430 --> 18:57.540
Isn't it against the law or something for you

18:57.660 --> 18:59.520
To talk to me without attorney being here?

18:59.620 --> 19:01.370
We have a previous relationship. 

19:01.500 --> 19:03.130
We're friends,ellen.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.450
It's a little late to play that card,don't you think?

19:05.550 --> 19:07.510
Actually, with so much tension lately,

19:07.620 --> 19:09.550
I- i can't think of a better time.

19:09.980 --> 19:11.670
You're starting to show.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.520
You look beautiful.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.940
Thank you.

19:15.210 --> 19:17.250
I always envied pregnant women. 

19:17.430 --> 19:19.090
Never was one myself,obviously.

19:19.210 --> 19:21.290
Your father didn't want any more children.

19:21.530 --> 19:23.330
And now it's just me.

19:23.470 --> 19:25.470
And i know that must be hard for you.

19:25.700 --> 19:29.110
But,ellen,he can't afford what you want him to pay.

19:29.220 --> 19:32.040
There are tons of things 
i'm sure your father could part with-- 

19:32.230 --> 19:35.020
The picasso, the tiffany lamps.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.820
He's by no means broke.

19:36.950 --> 19:39.540
He's starting a new company. His assets are limited.

19:39.670 --> 19:41.740
I'm sorry,taylor,but i won't fall for that. 

19:41.850 --> 19:42.930
I can show you the books.

19:43.030 --> 19:46.020
I will not let him do the same thing 
to me he did to your mother. 

19:46.800 --> 19:48.470
What are you talking about?

19:52.880 --> 19:54.780
When-- when jordan left susan for me,

19:54.900 --> 19:58.560
He-- he hid his assets in offshore accounts.

19:58.720 --> 20:02.150
And then he hired the best divorce attorney 
his hidden money could buy 

20:02.260 --> 20:05.150
And had your mother declared incompetent to parent 

20:05.260 --> 20:08.340
Based on financial instability,so he got full custody. 

20:08.460 --> 20:09.310
I don't believe you.

20:09.450 --> 20:11.150
I wouldn't expect you to,

20:11.270 --> 20:12.980
But that's how jordan was in those days.

20:13.100 --> 20:15.070
He prote he loved at any cost. 

20:15.200 --> 20:17.180
My mother left us 

20:17.330 --> 20:19.920
Because she didn't want the burden of raising a daughter

20:20.040 --> 20:21.960
When she was starting her new life.

20:22.160 --> 20:25.380
Only after your father destroyed her old one.

20:31.250 --> 20:33.390
You keep dropping by like this, 
people are gonna start to think

20:33.510 --> 20:34.970
You're coming back to work here. 

20:35.080 --> 20:39.420
So,um,you know,things won't always be 
this awkward between us,right?

20:39.540 --> 20:42.400
Because before everything else, 
we were friends-- good friends.

20:42.540 --> 20:44.320
I'm so glad to hear you say that.

20:44.850 --> 20:46.300
Let's be friends again.

20:50.110 --> 20:51.640
So,friend,

20:51.790 --> 20:53.590
I hear you're dating ashley cardiff.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.960
What? Is it on tmz or something? 

20:56.040 --> 20:58.990
She's a client of mine.small world.

20:59.450 --> 21:00.620
Yeah,it is.

21:00.780 --> 21:06.230
I think she's... Fantastic...and cool,fun.

21:06.490 --> 21:08.920
I mean,obviously,it was a little weird at first-- 

21:09.030 --> 21:11.770
I don't think you have to worry 
i'm not sure we're dating anymore. 

21:11.910 --> 21:12.830
You're not?

21:12.920 --> 21:15.900
I,um,i told her about my visions.

21:16.130 --> 21:17.520
Why did you do that?

21:17.640 --> 21:18.690
Uh,i'm an idiot

21:18.800 --> 21:21.410
If it's any consolation,it's probably for the best. 

21:21.550 --> 21:22.470
What do you mean?

21:22.580 --> 21:27.390
I just-- i happen to know that ashley 
is not looking for anything serious,

21:27.620 --> 21:30.950
And,well, you're a serious person with serious responsibilities. 

21:31.050 --> 21:32.660
It's-- it could be a bad combo.

21:32.760 --> 21:35.010
You dn't say anything to her about me,did you?

21:36.110 --> 21:38.540
I just-- i told her you were special.

21:39.470 --> 21:41.450
That's code for weirdo.

21:41.620 --> 21:44.280
No wonder e acted strangely 
when i told her about my visions.

21:44.410 --> 21:46.370
You had her primed to think that i'm crazy town.

21:46.490 --> 21:48.790
Well,why did you tell her about 
your visions in the first place?

21:48.890 --> 21:50.230
- you've had three dates!  - four.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.030
Oh,right,i forgot-- third date,sex,

21:53.150 --> 21:54.590
Fourth date,tell her you're a prophet.

21:54.710 --> 21:56.190
You're not exactly facing this objectively. 

21:56.300 --> 21:57.170
What's that supposed to mean?

21:57.300 --> 21:58.870
Well,you're obviously a little jealous. 

21:58.990 --> 22:00.890
All i did was protect you. 

22:00.980 --> 22:03.220
All i ever do is protect you!

22:03.400 --> 22:04.710
But you know what,eli? 

22:04.830 --> 22:06.990
I take it back.i don't think you're special.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.110
I think you're an ass.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.600
Genny,could you tell us what you use this notebook for?

22:25.740 --> 22:27.100
Jotting down thoughts i have--

22:27.220 --> 22:30.930
Math stuff,physics formulas, the occasional song lyric.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.950
I took this notebook to professor blanchard,

22:34.060 --> 22:35.500
Head of the physics department at staord. 

22:35.630 --> 22:36.980
I didn't say you could do that.

22:37.150 --> 22:39.390
But then, what's mine is yours.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.450
He was very impressed. 

22:40.570 --> 22:41.830
Objection-- hearsay.

22:41.930 --> 22:43.790
I have a supporting affidavit, your honor,

22:43.890 --> 22:46.170
Mr. Pelfrey wants to cross dr. Blanchard,he can. 

22:46.280 --> 22:47.120
Overruled.

22:47.220 --> 22:50.390
Dr. Blanchard said that some of the formulas in this book

22:50.500 --> 22:52.680
Used some of the most advanced mathematics

22:52.780 --> 22:55.160
And innovative reasoning he's ever seen.

22:55.290 --> 23:00.090
He also said that there wa no discussion 
of anything remotely weaponlike. 

23:00.230 --> 23:04.600
Well,duh.i wasn't building anything weapons of mass destructionish.

23:04.710 --> 23:07.080
Then what were you using the nuclear materials for? 

23:07.190 --> 23:08.130
It's complicated.

23:08.230 --> 23:10.890
Dumb it down for me as much as you can.

23:11.010 --> 23:15.140
Well,i was riffing on the idea of creating 
a controlled alpha multiplication device

23:15.240 --> 23:19.170
Combing the design elements of 
a radioisotope thermo electric generator

23:19.310 --> 23:24.810
And a nuclear pulse propulsion technology 
to creat a- a low-energy nuclear reaction.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.230
I haven't quite figured it out yet. 

23:27.700 --> 23:29.000
Thank you.

23:29.130 --> 23:32.780
Do you see any, practical purpose for 
this kind of technology in the future?

23:32.890 --> 23:37.740
If i get it right, it could be useful 
in getting some traction on cold fusion.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.140
Cold fusion.

23:39.780 --> 23:43.490
Reading from dr. Blanchard's affidavit,

23:44.560 --> 23:47.110
"genny's may be the most significant contribution "

23:47.220 --> 23:49.790
toward a carbon-free energy economy

23:49.900 --> 23:51.930
Since we first split the atom."

23:52.900 --> 23:54.440
That's nice.

23:54.650 --> 23:58.310
But the point is, not a bomb.

24:00.700 --> 24:01.910
Not a bomb.

24:02.470 --> 24:03.580
Thank you.

24:05.600 --> 24:11.160
Think of prophet as a shmancy title like-- like duke or viscount.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.430
Interesting perspective.

24:13.570 --> 24:15.230
What is a viscount anyway? 

24:15.410 --> 24:16.580
I don't know.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.330
Half a count?

24:20.020 --> 24:23.390
I mean,most of the time i'm just completely normal.

24:23.540 --> 24:25.870
Let me prove it to you. 
Come to dinner tonight at my brother's. 

24:25.970 --> 24:27.510
I don't-- i don't know.

24:27.620 --> 24:29.570
I- i'm supposed to go to ts benefit.

24:29.690 --> 24:32.040
Please come. I mean,you'll love nate,

24:32.160 --> 24:34.680
And his fiancee beth-- she's the best.

24:34.810 --> 24:36.570
The three of you can make fun of me all night.

24:38.040 --> 24:40.040
I guess i could just send a check.

24:40.180 --> 24:41.120
Great.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.080
- I'll see you later. 
- Bye.

24:43.970 --> 24:45.090
Yes.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.160
You ready?

24:47.500 --> 24:50.750
Keith,i've got mojo, and it's rising.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.560
I'm gonna kick some serious ass. I can feel it.

24:54.090 --> 24:55.630
Okay, you're frightening me now.

24:55.780 --> 24:59.090
Genny,do you have friends or 
family you discuss your experiments with? 

24:59.210 --> 25:00.460
It's not any of their business.

25:00.580 --> 25:03.330
Outside of your experiments, do you have any hobbies?

25:03.530 --> 25:05.460
Do you go see movies? 

25:06.270 --> 25:09.890
So basically,you're a genius recluse who hates the establishment. 

25:10.010 --> 25:11.060
Objection-- relevance.

25:11.170 --> 25:13.580
I see what you're trying to paint me as.i'm not a unabomber. 

25:13.680 --> 25:15.520
- Sustained. 
- You know,i'm curious. 

25:15.640 --> 25:18.030
There are other places you could 
have done your experiments,safer places.

25:18.170 --> 25:21.320
You could have applied for a job with the government,energy company. 

25:21.450 --> 25:23.020
I'm sure they'd all be interested in your work. 

25:23.130 --> 25:24.970
They'd be interested in squashing my invention

25:25.080 --> 25:28.080
To make sure that the world remained dependent on oil forever. 

25:28.930 --> 25:31.770
My father worked for the auto industry his entire life.

25:31.910 --> 25:36.530
In 1979, he digned an engine that 
could get 59 miles to the gallon.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.410
Want to know why you never read about 
it in "the new york times"?

25:39.520 --> 25:43.540
Government and big oil killed it,and it killed him.

25:44.170 --> 25:45.900
So you can call me a terrorist.

25:46.010 --> 25:47.840
You can call me any other names you can think of.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.640
But it all boils down to this-- 

25:49.730 --> 25:54.860
You've arrested me because 
i refuse to play by a system that squashes innovation,

25:54.970 --> 25:57.330
Civil liberties and science.

25:57.470 --> 25:59.380
I want a conference with counsel. 

25:59.540 --> 26:01.310
Your honor, i'm not done with my cross-examination--

26:01.420 --> 26:03.960
Now. Clear the courtroom, please. 

26:04.100 --> 26:05.670
All rise.

26:07.570 --> 26:11.750
This is what i know-- this girl wasn't building 
a weapon of any kind of destruction. 

26:11.880 --> 26:12.900
Thank you,judge.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.960
But she was also in possession of some very nuclear materials,

26:16.060 --> 26:17.790
No matter how legally obtained. 

26:17.880 --> 26:23.230
Which is why i'll drop the w.m.d. charges 
if he pleads to the max on the possession.

26:23.340 --> 26:24.370
That's 25 years. 

26:24.480 --> 26:26.430
She's a kid, a brilliant sentist.

26:26.540 --> 26:28.480
Yes,whose brilliance might just blow up the neighborhood.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.290
She's admitted to possessing the materials,

26:30.410 --> 26:32.770
So the only plea you've got left is jury nullification. 

26:32.880 --> 26:34.830
Which i won't permit in my courtroom.

26:34.970 --> 26:37.710
And that presents us both with a dilemma,mr. Stone.

26:37.850 --> 26:41.410
I don't want to be the judge that 
puts the next einstein in prison.

26:41.550 --> 26:45.120
You've got an einstein who very clearly broke the law.

26:45.260 --> 26:47.220
She won't agree to serve any jail time,your honor,

26:47.340 --> 26:49.860
And i could not in good conscience convince her to.

26:49.960 --> 26:53.130
Well,you're also very smart, mr. Stone

26:53.510 --> 26:55.270
Figure something out.

26:56.780 --> 26:58.990
I'm sure there's an explanation.

26:59.810 --> 27:02.030
Um,must be traffic.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.840
Maybe she's stuck in an elevator with no cell service.

27:04.980 --> 27:07.400
Oh,come on. Beth hasn't been on time a day in her life. 

27:07.540 --> 27:08.480
What?

27:08.590 --> 27:11.920
And now i'm gonna go check on the lasagna, uh,before it burns.

27:13.220 --> 27:14.750
I'm just so sorry she missed ben. 

27:14.880 --> 27:17.220
Oh,don't worry.He got to stay up an hour past his bedtime.

27:17.330 --> 27:19.990
As far as he's concerned, the night's a success.

27:20.410 --> 27:22.680
Ashley's a very lucky woman, eli. 

27:23.400 --> 27:25.170
You're a catch.

27:25.430 --> 27:26.520
Oh,yeah?

27:26.650 --> 27:29.350
How come you never returned my call after our night at college? 

27:29.480 --> 27:32.910
It was your first time.our "night" 
was a little more like 30 seconds. 

27:33.080 --> 27:34.380
Oh,yeah.

27:38.020 --> 27:39.030
Is that her? 

27:39.130 --> 27:40.850
When do we eat?

27:41.440 --> 27:43.250
She's not coming.

27:46.270 --> 27:47.530
I'm sorry.

27:49.450 --> 27:52.280
I'm just gonna get something with 
a little more kick than wine.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.920
Ah,wait,wait,wait. I'll get it for you.

27:57.630 --> 27:58.260
What is this? 

27:58.370 --> 27:59.400
Nothing. Those are nothing.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.190
Don't look at 'em, 'cause they're not even there.

28:01.300 --> 28:02.810
Oh,i'm having a vision,then, 

28:03.440 --> 28:06.570
Of plane tickets to vegas--one with my name on it.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.580
Why am i going to vegas next weekend? 

28:08.690 --> 28:10.130
Because we're eloping.

28:10.650 --> 28:12.390
Eloping loping?

28:12.520 --> 28:14.970
Yeah,look,i didn't want you to find out this way,but--

28:15.080 --> 28:17.470
Well,there's no bad way to find that out! 

28:18.320 --> 28:19.590
Oh,my god!

28:20.110 --> 28:21.510
That is amazing.

28:21.620 --> 28:23.430
This is inedible.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.180
You avoiding me?

28:33.320 --> 28:35.280
You canceled our lunch. I haven't seen you all day--

28:35.730 --> 28:37.910
A difficult feat in our half-empty firm.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.120
Is something the matter? 

28:39.280 --> 28:42.720
I just got off the phone with your former divorcattorney.

28:44.450 --> 28:48.690
Those conversations never put a smile on my face,either.

28:48.790 --> 28:52.830
He confirmed what ellen told me about 
what you did to my mother.

28:57.350 --> 29:00.140
Taylor,whatever you're thinking...

29:02.180 --> 29:03.660
It's more complicated.

29:03.780 --> 29:06.900
All these years,you let me think the worst of her--

29:07.170 --> 29:09.860
That she was a mother who would run out on her child! 

29:09.990 --> 29:11.550
She did run out.

29:11.670 --> 29:14.250
After you forced her out with your lies and manipulation. 

29:14.390 --> 29:15.170
Taylor--

29:15.270 --> 29:18.970
I virtually had no relationship with my own mother.

29:20.010 --> 29:23.910
That's affected every single aspect of my life.

29:25.050 --> 29:26.570
I admit i wasn't...

29:27.310 --> 29:33.300
A great person back then.
that's why i'm wor so hard to change now.

29:33.410 --> 29:34.450
Thanks for admitting it.

29:34.550 --> 29:38.730
But i begged her to stay and maintain a relationship th you.

29:38.820 --> 29:42.850
Please,just go,dad. Just go.

30:14.210 --> 30:16.010
This is unexpected. 

30:16.910 --> 30:18.460
Are you real?

30:19.230 --> 30:21.290
I'm prone to hallucinating.

30:21.610 --> 30:24.440
I wanted to apologize in person.

30:24.950 --> 30:28.350
Standing you up was rude and mean.

30:28.820 --> 30:30.360
It's not who i am.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.090
I was going to come. 

30:32.200 --> 30:33.900
I had my coat on and everything.

30:35.290 --> 30:39.000
But then i just started to think about 
what it means to date someone with...

30:40.130 --> 30:44.760
With,so much baggage 

30:47.110 --> 30:50.410
Well,i'm just not a-- baggage handler.

30:52.460 --> 30:56.930
It might sound shallow,
but i'- i'm not a serious person.

30:57.060 --> 30:59.140
Things are not serious with me all the time.

30:59.260 --> 31:02.400
You have a life-threatening condition that causes you to see things. 

31:02.510 --> 31:05.370
That's... Serious.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.220
You're a great guy...

31:10.360 --> 31:11.970
And we had a lot of fun,

31:12.110 --> 31:16.140
But i can't pretend that this is normal.

31:19.750 --> 31:21.890
I'm sorry.

31:34.510 --> 31:37.430
You actually made an appointment. Must be serious.

31:39.330 --> 31:40.740
Oh,boy.

31:41.110 --> 31:43.120
She dropped you like a bad habit, didn't she? 

31:43.200 --> 31:44.500
Like baggage,actually.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.720
Turns out ashley's more the carry-on luggage type.

31:47.810 --> 31:50.210
Okay. Eh,good riddance then.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.610
This isn't exactly the warm shoulder to 
cry on i was hoping for. 

31:53.870 --> 31:56.190
Look,i know you're hurting,

31:56.420 --> 31:57.630
And it sucks,

31:57.800 --> 32:00.460
But the fact is, if ashley can't handle who you are, 

32:00.570 --> 32:01.770
You're better off without her.

32:01.880 --> 32:05.380
I don't exactly connect with a different woman every week,frank.

32:06.170 --> 32:09.550
I just-- i want to,um... Connect?

32:11.200 --> 32:13.130
I want to not be alone.

32:14.230 --> 32:15.730
Last week you said you weren't.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.820
Well,the truth is, i'm lonely.

32:21.380 --> 32:25.900
And i just-- i don't think it's fair 
that i get to see other people's futures,you know?

32:26.530 --> 32:29.300
Like knowing that my client is going to overcome a lifetime

32:29.420 --> 32:32.520
Of rejection and loneliness and win the nobel prize.

32:37.340 --> 32:40.730
I want someone to tell me that my life is gonna change,too.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.870
It wasn't in your dad's journal,eli.

32:42.990 --> 32:44.580
You've been able to show me the future before... 

32:44.680 --> 32:45.710
A possible future.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.150
With that dark arts thing-- 

32:47.240 --> 32:51.450
Look, eli,i told you i wouldn't use 
the nurhachi technique on you again.

32:51.560 --> 32:54.750
It's dangerous, mentally and physically,

32:54.860 --> 32:57.310
Particularly to someone with your condition

32:57.700 --> 33:00.360
Everybody else doesn't know their destiny,eli.

33:00.490 --> 33:02.400
Everybody else doesn't have the responsibilities i do,

33:02.520 --> 33:03.680
And they're not alone because of that. 

33:03.790 --> 33:06.320
You're not alone because of your calling,eli.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.720
You're alone because you haven't found the right person yet.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.180
You won't show me if i will? 

33:10.300 --> 33:13.040
I won't perform a dangerous procedure on you

33:13.730 --> 33:16.410
Just to help you with your love life,o.

33:30.570 --> 33:33.270
I've seen guys who just got sentenced 
to the gas chamber who look better.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.920
Mm,yeah. Bad night.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.160
I figured since there's nothing 
i can do to stop my life from sucking,

33:39.280 --> 33:41.190
I may as well look for a way to help our client.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.110
Any luck?

33:42.240 --> 33:45.580
No. Genny's supposed to win the nobel prize in 40 years,

33:45.700 --> 33:49.740
But i can't see how spending 25 of thi emst eontcehing formulas

33:49.850 --> 33:53.190
Onto the wall with the back of a toothbrush 
is gonna help her invent cold fusion. 

33:53.300 --> 33:54.230
Maybe she doesn't.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.770
But you said sometimes your visions 
don't come out the way you think,right? 

33:57.050 --> 34:00.020
So... Thanks.that's just the lightning bolt of optimism i need. 

34:00.140 --> 34:01.980
Sorry. It's just,you know,

34:02.070 --> 34:05.100
I don't think we're gonna figure out 
cold fusion in 400 years, Much less 40. 

34:05.210 --> 34:07.040
Ccording to the "journal of science"?

34:07.160 --> 34:09.760
According to irving wallender, the wod expert on cold fusion,

34:09.889 --> 34:12.639
Experimental physical sciences director at los alamos.

34:12.730 --> 34:14.909
Irving wallender, irving wallender...

34:15.010 --> 34:16.300
Why is that name familiar?

34:16.670 --> 34:21.420
The greatest invention of the 21st century--cold fusion.

34:21.650 --> 34:24.590
He's the one who gives genny the nobel peace prize.

34:29.780 --> 34:31.860
So... Who's the nerd?

34:32.400 --> 34:36.090
Irving wallender. He's basically the legitimate version of you.

34:36.210 --> 34:37.480
I read your notebook. 

34:37.590 --> 34:40.380
Who hasn't? It's like a j.k. rowling novel at this point. 

34:40.489 --> 34:41.620
It was impressive--

34:41.750 --> 34:45.489
So impressive,in fact,that i put in a call 
to some friends in the a.u.s.a.'s office. 

34:45.630 --> 34:48.270
Dr. Wallender's getting all the charges against you dropped.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.880
So what,do i have to sleep with him or something? 

34:51.000 --> 34:53.409
No. Just come work for me.

34:53.590 --> 34:57.260
Los alamos is the most prestigious 
nuclear research institute in the country. 

34:57.370 --> 34:59.050
Then why don't you go work for him?

34:59.880 --> 35:01.900
You guys give us a minute?

35:07.170 --> 35:11.150
I'm sorry. Sometimes i foet that 
when you've got an i.q. north of 150,

35:11.280 --> 35:13.980
People sometimes don't understand what you tell them.

35:14.120 --> 35:17.640
So let me put it to you in 1-syllable words--

35:17.930 --> 35:20.900
I will not go work for the man.

35:21.010 --> 35:24.230
You either go work for the man, or he sends you to prison.

35:24.540 --> 35:28.140
Would you rather make license plates or history? 

35:28.270 --> 35:29.380
I don't care about history.

35:29.490 --> 35:30.960
I don't think that's true,genny.

35:31.090 --> 35:33.210
I think that you want people to know what youan do, 

35:33.380 --> 35:35.420
What your family can do.

35:35.590 --> 35:37.160
You think people won't listen to you now?

35:37.280 --> 35:39.650
Imagine how receptive they're gonna be 
when you're an ex-con. 

35:40.120 --> 35:41.950
They don't deserve to know,then.

35:42.230 --> 35:43.530
Really?

35:43.900 --> 35:48.010
what about those people ***Or alexandria,egypt, 

35:48.120 --> 35:50.300
Whose homes might wash away when the ice caps melt?

35:50.640 --> 35:53.480
I'm sure the polar bears didn't do much to piss you off.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.510
Can you really be that selfish? 

35:55.620 --> 35:57.080
You wouldn't understand.

35:57.180 --> 35:59.850
Believe me,i do.

36:02.220 --> 36:04.520
I understand that you have a gift.

36:05.440 --> 36:10.000
But a gift is something that is given.you don't own it.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.000
The world does...

36:14.510 --> 36:16.960
And the world is asking you to use it.

36:17.990 --> 36:20.170
And you don't get to say no,

36:20.730 --> 36:23.250
No matter how much you might want to.

36:28.510 --> 36:32.150
Asou can see, we've conced on the house,
the alimony and the car.

36:32.250 --> 36:34.740
The only thing my client requests is the retention of 

36:34.870 --> 36:36.860
The artworks purchased during the marriage.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.310
I'll have my office draw up the paperwork.

36:44.050 --> 36:44.930
Taylor,can we talk?

36:45.060 --> 36:47.390
Wrong time, wrong place,dad.

36:56.440 --> 36:57.550
Thank you.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.050
It was jordan's decision.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.370
Jordan's? Not your father's?

37:03.070 --> 37:06.570
The last thing i ever wanted is 
to between you and your dad.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.050
All you did was tell me the truth,ellen.

37:09.550 --> 37:12.090
Honestly,i should be thanking you.

37:12.210 --> 37:15.860
Taylor,you are, and you always have been,

37:16.290 --> 37:17.960
Your dad's whole world.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.840
Don't forget that.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.090
Yeah. Thank you.

37:34.670 --> 37:37.170
Thank you. Okay. Okay,bye.

37:39.270 --> 37:40.050
You okay?

37:40.170 --> 37:43.850
I'm good. I,uh,i just won my case-- well,sort of.

37:43.960 --> 37:46.340
Charges dropped, client's got a new job.

37:46.450 --> 37:48.850
That's great! That's great. Some good news,right?

37:48.970 --> 37:52.580
Yeah. Um,ashley dumped me.

37:52.690 --> 37:57.030
- Oh,man. 
- That's what i get for letting my acupuncturist be my matchmaker.

37:58.060 --> 38:00.930
Still,don't worry. I mean,i'm gonna be fine.

38:01.060 --> 38:03.120
I got a wedding in vegas to look forward to. 

38:03.230 --> 38:04.150
So you'll be there?

38:04.260 --> 38:06.580
You kidding? I'm not gonna let getting dumped by some heiress 

38:06.680 --> 38:11.040
Prevent me from being the best man to the bestman that i know.

38:11.150 --> 38:14.140
Oh. I hope that phrase isn't making it into your toast. 

38:14.260 --> 38:15.660
I wouldn't rule it out.

38:17.070 --> 38:18.470
Family is everything, 

38:18.610 --> 38:21.900
And you are my family,and i can't let you just ignore me. I can't.

38:22.000 --> 38:22.700
Dad. 

38:22.790 --> 38:24.440
You're going to be a mother,taylor,a parent,

38:24.530 --> 38:27.760
And there are things in your past you'll be ashamed for your child to learn.

38:28.390 --> 38:33.180
What i did to your mother was unforgivable.

38:33.740 --> 38:34.550
But?

38:34.660 --> 38:36.500
But there was a context.

38:36.630 --> 38:41.310
It was a divorce-- a bitter one.both sides behaved badly.

38:42.900 --> 38:45.600
I- i didn't want to be a weekend father.

38:45.730 --> 38:48.020
I wanted you to live with me,and-- 

38:48.120 --> 38:52.430
And your mother was flighty and difficult.

38:53.380 --> 38:55.410
It wasn't hard to show that in court,

38:55.500 --> 39:01.800
And in my opinion,the fact that she left proves it.

39:04.020 --> 39:07.740
I was hoping you would accept my apology.

39:08.370 --> 39:10.410
This was my mother.

39:13.350 --> 39:16.470
I- i don't know what it's gonna take to get over this,but...

39:18.020 --> 39:20.280
I know an apology isn't enough.

39:42.830 --> 39:44.390
How can i help you today?

39:45.280 --> 39:46.500
You're dr. Lee?

39:46.610 --> 39:50.040
Yes. My father was half chinese.

39:50.190 --> 39:53.030
What's with all the asian acupuncturists not being asian? 

39:53.150 --> 39:54.350
Excuse me?

39:54.440 --> 39:55.470
Nothing. Sorry.

39:56.070 --> 40:00.650
So how can i help you? Let me guess-- acid reflux?

40:01.220 --> 40:02.310
Insomnia.

40:02.430 --> 40:03.810
Insomnia's part of it.

40:03.910 --> 40:07.020
Um,this is gonna sound strange.

40:07.140 --> 40:12.620
I,uh,i recently had a form of acupuncture done on me 

40:12.960 --> 40:15.780
Called the dark truth.

40:18.090 --> 40:19.400
Never heard of it.

40:19.510 --> 40:20.380
Really?

40:21.180 --> 40:24.730
Um,i think nurhachi would be pretty disappointed to hear that,

40:25.920 --> 40:28.410
You being a student of his and all.

40:34.440 --> 40:38.540
The dark truth is not exactly on my standard list of services.

40:38.830 --> 40:40.600
I haven't done it in years.

40:40.900 --> 40:42.310
Plus it's dangerous. 

40:42.420 --> 40:43.580
I'll pay.

40:44.850 --> 40:46.130
I- i don't know.

40:46.230 --> 40:48.240
How does $1,000 sound?

40:49.260 --> 40:51.960
I'll be fine. I've done it before.

40:52.090 --> 40:53.820
Then you know the experience can be unpredictable.

40:53.930 --> 40:56.670
I can't just dial up whichever future you dictate. 

40:56.770 --> 40:57.920
I know.

41:00.740 --> 41:02.440
You're the customer.

41:04.710 --> 41:07.890
I warn you, this hurts.

41:08.570 --> 41:11.370
Yeah,not as much as not knowing.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.080
I'm so sorry nate

41:27.160 --> 41:28.950
I can't marry you.

41:30.220 --> 41:31.820
I'm so sorry.

41:31.950 --> 41:33.640
- Beth 
- no.
