WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:08.269
I know you're busy with school.

00:08.312 --> 00:09.618
I'm glad
you're busy with school,

00:09.661 --> 00:11.489
but your poor mother misses you,
Lily.

00:11.533 --> 00:14.623
I can't tomorrow. I'm heading
out of town for work.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.451
Us Song girls stay busy.

00:16.494 --> 00:18.801
That's just who we are.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.152
So it has to be tonight.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.936
It won't take long. I promise.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.764
It'll be quick.

00:25.808 --> 00:28.419
And I got a surprise for you.
I got a few surprises, actually.

00:29.377 --> 00:30.943
I love you, too.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.858
Bye.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.471
Laura Song?

00:36.514 --> 00:37.950
NCIS Special Agent Callen.

00:39.082 --> 00:39.865
Agent Hanna.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.302
What's going on?

00:41.345 --> 00:42.651
We think you might
have been compromised.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.000
We need to get you
to a secure location

00:44.044 --> 00:45.523
immediately.

00:45.567 --> 00:48.004
â™ª

01:08.981 --> 01:09.939
Where is everybody?

01:09.982 --> 01:11.071
Well, it's a Sunday,

01:11.114 --> 01:13.116
so Sam is fishing,
Fatima's drag racing,

01:13.160 --> 01:16.032
Rountree's crushing it
in a hot dog eating contest,

01:16.076 --> 01:17.816
Callen is probably
smooching it up with Anna

01:17.860 --> 01:18.904
and you and I are
at the beach right now

01:18.948 --> 01:20.558
drinking mojitos out of a can.

01:20.602 --> 01:21.907
Except for the fact
that we're not 'cause we're here

01:21.951 --> 01:24.127
because Kilbride
called us in on a Sunday.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.824
Well, you forget that he
probably also had to cancel

01:25.868 --> 01:27.957
his plans, right?
He doesn't work 24/7.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.438
That's a good point. I wonder
what Kilbride does on a Sunday.

01:30.481 --> 01:33.180
I mean, besides the obvious
goat yoga and ASMR.[chuckles]

01:33.223 --> 01:34.964
Well, I know he has a son.
I don't know where he is

01:35.007 --> 01:36.618
or what their
relationship is like.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.490
Son of Kilbride.
Wow, I do not envy that.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.579
Oh, come on. You're assuming
he's the same kind of parent

01:41.623 --> 01:44.234
as he is the Director
of Special Operations.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.888
I mean, look at me and my dad.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.455
You know?
He was a tough son of a bitch

01:47.498 --> 01:49.457
with all those Marines
under him, but...

01:49.500 --> 01:52.503
with me, he was just... dad.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.244
My best friend.
My whole world.

01:54.288 --> 01:56.464
Wow. That's another good point.

01:56.507 --> 01:58.596
You know what? In fact,

01:58.640 --> 02:00.511
next time I see him up
in his office, Kilbride,

02:00.555 --> 02:02.992
I'm gonna go in there and I'm
gonna ask him about fatherhood.

02:03.035 --> 02:04.472
You know? Maybe he'll have
some advice for me.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.430
We could hold hands,
cry it out,

02:06.474 --> 02:08.128
do some trust falls.
What do you think?

02:08.171 --> 02:09.694
Yeah. No, I think that
you might walk out of there

02:09.738 --> 02:11.435
missing a limb.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.176
That is another good point.
God, you're en fuegotoday.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.612
I'm always on fuego.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.527
You know what,
I know what he does on Sundays.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.703
He wanders up and down
the aisles of Home Depot,

02:18.747 --> 02:20.879
wearing
a little orange vest...[laughing]

02:20.923 --> 02:22.185
just answering
people's questions

02:22.229 --> 02:24.013
about the right diameter
for wood screws

02:24.056 --> 02:26.276
for their planter boxes.Then he gets home

02:26.320 --> 02:29.540
and watches Dirty Dozen
and takes notes from Lee Marvin.

02:29.584 --> 02:30.802
Oh, God.

02:30.846 --> 02:31.716
Thank you for
the compliment,

02:31.760 --> 02:32.717
Agent Blye.

02:32.761 --> 02:35.067
Admiral Kilbride. Hi.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.678
We thought you were gonna...
[exhales]

02:36.721 --> 02:37.766
meet us here in person.

02:37.809 --> 02:39.985
I'm on a flight
into Santa Monica.

02:40.029 --> 02:42.379
I'll be landing
within the hour.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.425
Until then, I have
an urgent matter

02:44.468 --> 02:45.904
I need your team
to handle.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.341
You're gonna be late
for Home Depot.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.604
Okay. What is it?Protectiondetail.

02:49.647 --> 02:52.433
An operative working deep cover
may have been compromised.

02:52.476 --> 02:53.390
That's not good.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.652
Did you not hear me when I said

02:54.696 --> 02:56.219
it was an urgent matter?

02:56.263 --> 02:58.830
So how 'bout we shelve
the useless commentary?

02:58.874 --> 03:00.571
Sorry.

03:01.529 --> 03:04.140
Her name is
Laura Song.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.925
For the past two decades,
she has provided

03:06.969 --> 03:09.885
the Office of Naval Intelligence
with crucial intel

03:09.928 --> 03:12.540
on the capabilities
of China's navy.

03:12.583 --> 03:15.151
So if her cover
has been compromised...

03:15.195 --> 03:16.457
They're gonna want her dead.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.806
What happened there?
Was there a leak?

03:17.849 --> 03:19.242
We have people
working on that.

03:19.286 --> 03:22.680
Your team's priority
is Laura's protection.

03:22.724 --> 03:25.117
Now, Callen and Sam are

03:25.161 --> 03:27.946
in the process of securing
her at a safe house,

03:27.990 --> 03:30.297
along with Agents
Namazi and Rountree.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.212
Send us the address.
We'll join 'em.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.822
No, I want you
to pick up her daughter.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.824
She is a freshman at USC.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.869
Take her to the boatshed.
Keep her there

03:37.913 --> 03:39.784
until I give the all clear.
Understood?

03:39.828 --> 03:42.265
Understood, sir.I have sent her address
to your phones.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.919
Go.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.051
[car approaching]

03:48.532 --> 03:49.968
[shuts off engine]

03:51.709 --> 03:54.495
I just feel bad, you know?
It's like Ben was really excited

03:54.538 --> 03:55.713
about this dinner.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.237
So go next weekend.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.021
Yeah, doesn't
work like that.

03:59.064 --> 04:01.589
I mean, L'Ardoise is, like,
the hottest reservation in L.A.,

04:01.632 --> 04:03.155
and they know it.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.853
There's literally a
90-second grace period,

04:04.896 --> 04:06.594
and then they just
give away your table.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.291
You serious?Yeah.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.945
Seriously, you should
drive by sometime.

04:09.988 --> 04:12.121
There's a line of people
waiting to pounce.

04:12.164 --> 04:13.601
Okay, correct me
if I'm wrong...

04:13.644 --> 04:14.819
You know I will.All right.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.647
Aren't dinner dates
supposed to be relaxing?

04:16.691 --> 04:19.563
Fun? And not, like, a whole
Hunger Gamesexperience

04:19.607 --> 04:22.174
where only the richest people
get to eat steak?

04:22.218 --> 04:23.915
Well, actually,
this place is vegan.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.484
Come on.Hmm?

04:27.528 --> 04:29.791
Vegans can't pounce.
They're too anemic.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.228
Maybe in Texas. But L.A.
vegans take supplements.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.534
You don't want
to mess with them.

04:33.577 --> 04:36.058
I'm not seeing the appeal
of any of this.

04:36.101 --> 04:39.453
So crazy and stressful,
trying to dine out in this city.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.324
Not where I go.Where's that?

04:41.368 --> 04:43.370
[chuckles]
Normal places

04:43.413 --> 04:45.110
without apostrophes
in their name.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.417
Where you just show up
and get a good plate of food.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.810
Here? In L.A.?

04:48.853 --> 04:50.028
[scoffs]
I don't think so.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.116
I'm not making this up.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.596
These places exist.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.555
I'll make a list for you,
and you can take your date.

04:54.598 --> 04:57.340
Well, at this point, I don't
think I'm going anywhere.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.211
Not with this last-minute
protection detail.

04:59.255 --> 05:00.604
[chuckles softly][sucks air through teeth]

05:00.648 --> 05:01.997
Do you think you can get
the cameras up and running

05:02.040 --> 05:03.433
while I reroute comms
through the system?

05:03.477 --> 05:05.043
Uh... sure.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.654
Let me just figure out the right

05:06.697 --> 05:08.960
input setting...
[inhales]

05:11.311 --> 05:12.834
There you go.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.011
I could've done that.
I just haven't worked

05:16.054 --> 05:17.317
with this particular system yet.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.710
Mm-hmm.
[inhales]

05:19.754 --> 05:22.147
We are ready for Laura Song.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.803
[exhales]

05:25.847 --> 05:28.328
[groans]
Well,

05:28.371 --> 05:30.373
thank you, gentlemen,
for a lovely tour

05:30.417 --> 05:32.157
of this city's
freeways.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.725
I know it was long, but we had
to be sure you weren't followed.

05:35.770 --> 05:38.076
Fatima! Rountree!

05:38.120 --> 05:40.557
Hey. Sorry,
we were just taking care

05:40.601 --> 05:42.385
of a few last-minute things.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.169
We good to go?We're good.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.606
Agent Devin Rountree.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.259
Laura Song.
So where you putting me up?

05:47.303 --> 05:50.306
Oh, it's a secure apartment
on the top floor.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.134
Pretty nice
by safe house standards.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.831
Fatima's up there right now
making sure

05:53.875 --> 05:55.180
everything's good for you guys.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.443
All right, I'm-a
take the stairs,

05:56.486 --> 05:57.661
make sure the rest of
the floors are secure.

05:57.705 --> 05:58.967
[ding]They are. I...

05:59.010 --> 06:00.577
already did that.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.058
Agent Rountree,

06:03.101 --> 06:05.060
your efforts are appreciated.No problem.

06:05.103 --> 06:06.104
Hope you enjoy your stay.

06:06.148 --> 06:09.064
I mean, I...

06:09.107 --> 06:11.458
hope you're comfortable. Uh...

06:11.501 --> 06:13.155
[exhales]

06:13.198 --> 06:14.548
[ding]

06:14.591 --> 06:16.332
Have your agents
picked up my daughter yet?

06:16.376 --> 06:18.421
They're almost there. When
they do, you can speak with her.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.380
Good.
She doesn't know what I do.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.859
I've protected her all
these years from all this,

06:21.903 --> 06:23.295
and I don't want
to throw it away

06:23.339 --> 06:25.733
until I know
what's going on.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.822
Ah. Agent Rountree

06:27.865 --> 06:29.301
wasn't wrong.
This'll do.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.042
CALLEN:
Laura Song, this is

06:31.086 --> 06:33.001
Agent Fatima Namazi.Hi.

06:33.044 --> 06:36.134
Sorry to meet you
under these circumstances.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.571
But if you need
to lay low for a spell,

06:37.614 --> 06:39.660
this is the place to do it.

06:39.703 --> 06:42.314
All the doors in this apartment
are solid steel.

06:42.358 --> 06:44.229
The windows
are bulletproof.

06:44.273 --> 06:46.580
And there's a panic room
in the bedroom.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.017
Impressive.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.627
But I don't think
I'll be using it.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.542
If this is the end...

06:52.586 --> 06:55.240
I'm gonna die out in
the open, not in a box.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.633
This isn't the end.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.940
Your cover may still be intact.
So sit tight.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.029
We'll know more when Kilbride
gets here in about an hour.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.726
[exhales]

07:02.770 --> 07:06.295
Well, until then, I guess
my life is in your hands.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.212
MAN:
Confirm interior secure.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.953
WOMAN:
Copy that. You're clear.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.346
MAN:
Stand by for 10-15.

07:15.609 --> 07:16.958
WOMAN:
Copy that.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.003
[indistinct chatter]

07:30.624 --> 07:32.669
â™ª

07:43.637 --> 07:45.116
What the hell happened?

07:45.160 --> 07:47.728
â™ª

08:01.176 --> 08:02.699
[beep]

08:03.961 --> 08:05.702
This is Office
of Naval Intelligence

08:05.746 --> 08:07.878
Inspector General Akhil Ali.

08:07.922 --> 08:10.925
It's Tuesday, November 9, 2021.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.841
09:54.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.538
I've been tasked
with determining

08:15.582 --> 08:18.498
the sequence of events that led
to Operative Laura Song's death.

08:18.541 --> 08:21.370
As none of the cameras at the
safe house recorded anything,

08:21.413 --> 08:24.982
I have only the accounts
of the NCIS agents to go on.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.985
To avoid any chance
of corrupting their accounts,

08:28.029 --> 08:32.512
they have been isolated from one
another for the last 36 hours.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.949
First up is...

08:34.992 --> 08:37.038
Agent Callen,

08:37.081 --> 08:38.866
you were in the secure
apartment with Laura Song

08:38.909 --> 08:40.824
before the attack began.
Is that correct?

08:40.868 --> 08:42.609
Yes, that is correct.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.785
What was your
impression of her?

08:46.003 --> 08:47.744
She was...

08:47.788 --> 08:50.051
confident, forceful,

08:50.094 --> 08:53.097
not somebody who would go down
without a fight.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.882
And she was drinking.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.232
A little bit.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.756
Not... not enough to get drunk.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.410
But, um...

09:03.543 --> 09:05.327
The scotch made her...

09:05.370 --> 09:06.633
chatty.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.595
You work for Hetty Lange,
don't you?

09:14.162 --> 09:15.555
Yeah.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.600
I did.
[chuckles]

09:17.644 --> 09:20.168
Don't really know
right now. Uh...[pouring drink]

09:20.211 --> 09:21.561
How'd you know?

09:23.084 --> 09:25.390
Hetty's fingerprints
are all over this place.

09:26.391 --> 09:28.132
Oh, no, thanks.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.395
How long have you known Hetty?

09:31.396 --> 09:33.660
Feels like my whole life.

09:33.703 --> 09:36.358
And... you and the admiral?

09:37.359 --> 09:39.143
Feels like forever.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.190
I was born in Nanjing,

09:42.233 --> 09:44.627
but my mother was American.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.760
So when my dad died,

09:46.803 --> 09:48.196
she moved me to San Diego,

09:48.239 --> 09:51.503
which I hated at first.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.332
But I loved watching the ships.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.682
So, when I turned 17,

09:55.725 --> 09:58.032
I joined the Navy,
and that's... [inhales]

09:58.075 --> 10:00.469
where Hollace found me.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.036
I wanted to work on a ship,

10:02.079 --> 10:06.475
but he chose me
for another mission.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.955
So I guess that's fitting.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.783
He pulled me
into the world of espionage,

10:09.826 --> 10:12.307
and now he's gonna pull me out.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.308
Well,

10:13.351 --> 10:15.745
again, we don't know that.

10:18.966 --> 10:22.752
"Every operative has
an expiration date."

10:23.797 --> 10:26.495
Something Hollace
would say.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.715
Sometimes we don't...
[inhales]

10:28.758 --> 10:31.152
leave so peacefully.

10:32.806 --> 10:33.763
But we chose

10:33.807 --> 10:35.460
this life and...

10:35.504 --> 10:37.637
the risks that go with it.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.986
That's not to say

10:39.029 --> 10:39.943
that we don't take care
of our own.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.205
That's why you're here.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.686
So that
doesn't happen.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.210
I'll drink to that.[door opens]

10:46.254 --> 10:47.908
[door closes]

10:47.951 --> 10:49.213
[clears throat]

10:49.257 --> 10:50.911
Have your daughter
on the phone.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.347
Thank you,
Agent Hanna.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.218
You're welcome.

10:54.262 --> 10:56.090
Sweetheart? Are you okay?

10:57.047 --> 10:58.919
All the other floors
are secure. All good here?

10:58.962 --> 11:00.311
All good.

11:00.355 --> 11:01.443
ALI:
And how much did you drink,

11:01.486 --> 11:02.749
Agent Callen?

11:05.577 --> 11:07.362
None.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.627
What happened next?After Agent Hanna
returned,

11:11.671 --> 11:14.630
I stepped out to get an ETA
from Admiral Kilbride.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.197
I have the record
of that call.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.634
But it only lasted
three seconds.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.244
[inhales]

11:20.288 --> 11:22.769
That's because my cell service
suddenly went out,

11:22.812 --> 11:25.815
and then all of the power
went out.

11:25.859 --> 11:26.903
[door opens]

11:29.601 --> 11:30.864
I was trying you on comms.
I can't reach Fatima

11:30.907 --> 11:32.735
or Rountree either.Phones are dead, too.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.172
Yeah, I'm definitely
gonna need a gun.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.087
And did you provide
her with a firearm

11:37.131 --> 11:39.089
at that time?No.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.177
Because she had been drinking?

11:40.221 --> 11:41.091
No.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.049
Why not?

11:42.092 --> 11:43.311
Because, from my experience,

11:43.354 --> 11:45.487
putting a gun
into a protectee's hand,

11:45.530 --> 11:47.750
especially one that is, uh...

11:47.794 --> 11:50.231
trained as an operative, it...

11:50.274 --> 11:51.841
it tends to put 'em
in more danger

11:51.885 --> 11:53.625
than if they didn't have a gun.

11:54.626 --> 11:55.758
Not sure I follow.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.806
It was our job to protect Song,

11:59.849 --> 12:01.677
not hers.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.897
Giving her a gun would have
just been an invitation

12:03.940 --> 12:06.421
for her to take
unnecessary risks.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.163
Not that...

12:09.206 --> 12:10.947
that stopped her.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.776
Lights are still on
across the street.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.604
It's just us.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.911
We're gonna need to get
her to the panic room.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.219
Song!

12:22.263 --> 12:23.960
Get back here!

12:24.004 --> 12:25.962
I'm not sitting around
in the dark.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.311
We need information.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.705
What we need is for you
to get in the panic room.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.750
I told you,

12:30.793 --> 12:32.012
I'm not getting in that room.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.535
[screams]

12:35.537 --> 12:37.408
So after you finished
your perimeter check,

12:37.452 --> 12:38.714
you returned to the apartment.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.194
What happened then?

12:41.195 --> 12:43.414
Agent Callen stepped
out to make a call.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.460
I kept watch in the apartment.

12:46.417 --> 12:50.117
Song was talking to her daughter
on the phone in the bedroom.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.294
And what was her state of mind
after the call?

12:54.991 --> 12:56.863
It's not easy
protecting your family

12:56.906 --> 12:58.168
from the dangers of the job.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.257
I know
from firsthand experience.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.566
It can take a toll.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.394
[footsteps approaching]

13:07.395 --> 13:09.484
[inhales]

13:09.527 --> 13:11.355
Thank you.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.880
Of course.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.273
[sighs]

13:17.753 --> 13:20.800
Maybe this is a...
blessing in disguise.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.326
If my career is over,
I can spend more time

13:25.369 --> 13:27.328
with my daughter.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.851
I've already missed so much.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.766
Mm.Her teachers
at boarding school

13:30.810 --> 13:32.463
have been more of a mother
to her than I have.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.552
Now I have to bribe her
with gifts just to get her

13:34.596 --> 13:36.337
to have dinner with me.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.993
But the truth is
she's fine.

13:40.036 --> 13:43.910
She's probably, um,
better off without me.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.694
Mm, you can't
think that way.

13:45.737 --> 13:48.305
She'll pull away more
and so will you.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.221
No matter how hard she makes it,

13:51.265 --> 13:53.963
you got to keep trying.

13:54.007 --> 13:56.357
How old is your daughter,
Agent Hanna?

13:57.706 --> 13:58.968
She's the same age as yours.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.013
She went to
boarding school, too.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.885
Does she get along
with her mother?

14:05.061 --> 14:06.628
She did.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.806
Her mom died.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.417
Oh. I'm sorry.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.337
[exhales]
How did it happen?

14:21.382 --> 14:23.340
[inhales]

14:23.384 --> 14:25.777
Line of duty.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.954
She was CIA.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.826
"Every operative..."

14:30.870 --> 14:32.262
I'm sorry?

14:33.568 --> 14:35.091
Nothing.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.878
ALI:
Was Laura Song drinking,

14:38.921 --> 14:41.010
Agent Hanna?

14:42.272 --> 14:43.839
[scoffs softly, inhales]

14:43.883 --> 14:45.232
There was a bottle of bourbon
on the coffee table.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.886
I didn't see her drink any.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.409
I'm sorry... bourbon?

14:48.452 --> 14:50.541
That's correct.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.369
Not scotch?

14:52.413 --> 14:54.284
It was bourbon.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.808
Your partner said it was scotch.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.462
It was bourbon.

14:58.506 --> 14:59.594
You're sure?

15:00.943 --> 15:02.684
Well, you know you can
check it out if you want.

15:02.727 --> 15:03.946
The bottle must
still be in the room.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.382
It's probably in
a million pieces.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.688
But if it's
really that important to you

15:06.731 --> 15:08.168
whether it's scotch or bourbon,

15:08.211 --> 15:10.300
I'm sure
you can glue 'em back together.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.042
[clears throat]

15:14.348 --> 15:15.566
What happened next?

15:15.610 --> 15:17.655
I got a call.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.919
Deeks, what's up?Hey, Sam, it's Deeks.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.529
Listen, we've been talking
to Lily, there's something

15:21.572 --> 15:23.487
you should know.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.663
Sam...
[signal breaking up]

15:25.707 --> 15:27.665
Deeks?

15:27.709 --> 15:29.580
What happened?

15:31.147 --> 15:33.628
G, you copy?

15:33.671 --> 15:35.543
Fatima? Rountree?

15:35.586 --> 15:37.414
Y-You can't reach anyone?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.678
I think I'm gonna need a gun.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.072
Agent Hanna,
did you give her a firearm?

15:43.116 --> 15:44.987
No, I did not.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.554
Why is that?

15:46.597 --> 15:48.121
'Cause the situation
didn't warrant it.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.210
We weren't under attack.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.125
But that quickly changed.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.301
CALLEN:
Song, get back here.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.868
Your agents are in trouble.
We need to find them.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.000
They can take care
of themselves.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.001
We need to get you
to the panic room.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.568
I'm not getting in that room!

16:01.569 --> 16:02.787
[grunts]

16:06.574 --> 16:08.010
Come with me!

16:08.054 --> 16:09.969
What about Hanna?

16:19.891 --> 16:22.851
[gunfire continues]

16:22.894 --> 16:23.895
You left me!

16:23.939 --> 16:25.158
I had to get her
to the panic room!

16:26.420 --> 16:27.899
Do I have to do everything
myself around here?

16:27.943 --> 16:29.901
I can help. Give me a gun.

16:29.945 --> 16:32.556
Now did the situation warrant
giving her a firearm?

16:32.600 --> 16:35.081
No, the situation warranted
getting her in the panic room.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.299
But she refused.

16:36.343 --> 16:38.258
That wasn't gonna stop me.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.521
We need to get you
to the safe room.No! Let go of me!

16:41.130 --> 16:43.089
CALLEN:
Sam!

16:43.132 --> 16:45.178
[grunts]

16:49.182 --> 16:51.184
[gunfire]

16:59.453 --> 17:01.281
Sam!

17:07.069 --> 17:09.724
When I came to, it was over.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.599
Song was dead.

17:15.643 --> 17:16.687
Do you still believe you made

17:16.731 --> 17:19.560
the right decision
not to arm her?

17:19.603 --> 17:22.389
Yes.Yes.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.260
But that doesn't mean
I don't take responsibility

17:24.304 --> 17:26.045
for what happened.CALLEN:
Laura Song should not

17:26.088 --> 17:28.612
have needed a gun in her hand
to protect herself.

17:28.656 --> 17:31.137
That was our job.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.877
And we failed.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.415
Agent Rountree,

17:48.458 --> 17:50.243
you and Agent Namazi
were covering

17:50.286 --> 17:52.158
the ground floor,
watching the security monitors.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.116
How did the evening begin?

17:54.160 --> 17:55.857
We performed the required
perimeter checks

17:55.900 --> 17:58.120
and reported back
to Agents Callen and Hanna.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.035
But there wasn't much to say.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.297
It was pretty quiet.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.691
So what did you do
to pass the time?

18:03.734 --> 18:05.867
Well, as an FBI agent,

18:05.910 --> 18:08.783
I've been on plenty of
stakeouts, so I knew to always

18:08.826 --> 18:11.829
bring something--
you know, a book, some music.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.962
And that night,

18:14.005 --> 18:16.269
I had magnets.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.358
[monitors blipping]

18:22.536 --> 18:24.451
Psst. It's your turn.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.412
Oh, sorry.

18:29.456 --> 18:32.111
Well, I've officially
missed my date at L'Ardoise.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.982
I don't think you
missed out on anything.

18:34.025 --> 18:36.593
Not the food
and especially not the guy.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.421
What are you talking about?
I like Ben.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.597
Do you?

18:40.641 --> 18:43.209
You act like it's a chore every
time you meet up with this guy.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.126
Oh, damn it!

18:47.169 --> 18:49.780
The trick is
to use the magnetic field

18:49.824 --> 18:51.173
to your advantage.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.219
Well, right now,
they're repelling me.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.699
And it's time for me
to go do my thing anyways.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.179
Put in a good word for me.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.876
Yeah, we'll see.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.139
"Her thing"?

19:00.182 --> 19:02.445
Uh, sorry. Prayers.

19:02.489 --> 19:05.144
Faith is a pretty important part
of Agent Namazi's life.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.930
So, she left her post

19:08.973 --> 19:10.410
to attend to a personal matter.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.368
Well...

19:12.412 --> 19:14.065
I mean, nothing was happening.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.937
I mean...

19:15.980 --> 19:18.244
I mean, even if something did,
she was on comms,

19:18.287 --> 19:20.376
So...And did anything happen?

19:22.248 --> 19:23.771
[sighs]

19:25.773 --> 19:27.514
What the...?

19:27.557 --> 19:29.777
I didn't touch anything.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.866
Was that the magnets?

19:33.259 --> 19:34.825
Oh, hell no.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.392
Fatima, we just lost power.

19:36.436 --> 19:37.959
Comms is rerouted
through the system.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.787
And once we lost power,
it's supposed to migrate

19:39.830 --> 19:42.790
back to the cell towers,
but that didn't happen.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.705
That's when I realized
they must've been using

19:44.748 --> 19:46.054
a powerful signal jammer.

19:46.097 --> 19:48.970
Callen, Sam? Anybody, copy?

19:49.013 --> 19:50.711
Hey.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.800
We got company.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.153
Here, let me help you.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.286
No, it's...
I'm all good, thanks.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.202
Oh...

20:03.245 --> 20:05.247
Here you go.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.382
Thank you.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.734
[door closes]

20:16.911 --> 20:19.087
Agent Namazi,

20:19.130 --> 20:21.350
I'm ONI Inspector General
Akhil Ali.

20:21.394 --> 20:23.439
Thank you
for being here.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.136
How's your leg?

20:25.180 --> 20:28.052
Uh, annoying,
but it's getting better.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.881
I actually have a doctor's
appointment after this.

20:30.925 --> 20:33.667
That's good. I'll try
not to keep you too long.

20:33.710 --> 20:36.104
I've been reviewing your file.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.237
It's, uh, very impressive.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.978
You've accomplished so much
for someone your age.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.807
And to give up
a lucrative television career

20:43.851 --> 20:46.332
for civil service,
it's really...

20:49.073 --> 20:51.250
Well, anyway...

20:51.293 --> 20:54.296
uh, I thought we could start
from just after you returned

20:54.340 --> 20:56.820
from the top floor apartment,
when you and Agent Rountree

20:56.864 --> 20:59.736
were on watch-- he mentioned
you were playing a game?

20:59.780 --> 21:01.303
Yeah, yeah.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.740
And I was kind of crushing it.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.047
Ha!
Gah!

21:06.090 --> 21:07.570
Magnets!Oh, come on,

21:07.614 --> 21:09.529
Tree, don't you know
that opposites attract?

21:13.794 --> 21:16.100
Oh, you missed your dinner date.

21:16.144 --> 21:18.189
Oh, don't worry about it.
I think you were right.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.279
I wasn't that excited to go.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.237
Plus I don't think
Ben's my type.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.891
ALI:
Why not?

21:23.934 --> 21:25.196
What?

21:25.240 --> 21:28.069
Why, uh...
why wasn't he your type?

21:29.331 --> 21:31.507
I'm... not sure

21:31.551 --> 21:33.770
I see how that's relevant.

21:33.814 --> 21:36.469
Is it... relevant?

21:36.512 --> 21:39.298
We'll circle back to that.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.778
Uh, what happened

21:41.822 --> 21:43.606
after you played the game?

21:43.650 --> 21:46.435
Uh, then I left

21:46.479 --> 21:48.785
to perform the first prayers
of the Muslim day.

21:48.829 --> 21:51.135
Now is prayer
something you always

21:51.179 --> 21:52.615
make time for
while on assignment?

21:52.659 --> 21:54.225
When reasonable.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.359
My faith makes me
a stronger person

21:57.403 --> 21:59.056
and a better agent.

22:02.582 --> 22:05.236
I-I admire that.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.501
I'm Muslim myself.

22:08.544 --> 22:11.460
But not as devout
as I'd like to be.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.506
It's, um...

22:13.549 --> 22:15.551
it's not easy.

22:15.595 --> 22:18.119
No, it's not.

22:18.162 --> 22:20.077
But it can be rewarding.

22:21.470 --> 22:24.038
Uh, s-so you did your prayers?

22:24.081 --> 22:27.302
Yeah, and that's when I saw
the first sign of trouble.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.435
[praying in Arabic]

22:32.176 --> 22:34.222
[continues in Arabic]

22:42.970 --> 22:45.842
Rountree, I've got movement on
the south side of the building.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.931
You see anything on the cameras?

22:49.324 --> 22:50.978
Rountree, do you copy?

22:58.072 --> 23:00.379
Hey, we got company.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.468
Yeah, comms are down.I saw two shadows on
the south side of the building.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.295
We need to get
to the others.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.781
[soft clattering nearby]

23:11.825 --> 23:13.609
What was that?Came from the door.

23:15.176 --> 23:17.004
Be careful.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.750
Move!

23:31.801 --> 23:33.673
[gunfire]

23:42.682 --> 23:45.815
Agent Rountree and I managed
to take out several operatives

23:45.859 --> 23:48.122
downstairs. I'm not even
exactly sure how many.

23:48.165 --> 23:51.168
We were quickly overwhelmed and
had to retreat to the top floor.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.780
And that's where we ran
into Laura Song.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.175
[screams]

23:58.219 --> 23:59.525
Are you okay?

23:59.568 --> 24:01.440
Get back! Get back!

24:03.746 --> 24:06.227
This way! This way!

24:06.270 --> 24:07.750
Take cover!

24:12.494 --> 24:14.017
FATIMA:
Rountree, hurry!

24:15.018 --> 24:16.063
We can't stay here!

24:16.106 --> 24:18.369
[grunts][gunshots]

24:27.378 --> 24:29.511
Come on.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.646
Come on!

24:35.735 --> 24:37.867
[Fatima shouts]

24:37.911 --> 24:39.347
Aah!

24:46.615 --> 24:48.661
Aah!

24:49.966 --> 24:52.534
[groans]
Oh, that hurts!

24:52.578 --> 24:54.275
Let me see where you're hit.[winces]

24:54.318 --> 24:55.929
We don't have time.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.322
We can't stay here, either.

25:02.675 --> 25:05.155
Oh, that hurts.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.203
Oh, this hurts.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.944
[panting]

25:10.987 --> 25:12.598
[grunts]

25:12.641 --> 25:15.470
[muffled shouting nearby]They're coming in!

25:15.514 --> 25:17.646
Song.You go-- you're injured.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.518
No way. You first.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.563
[shouting]There's no time to argue.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.044
Go![grunting]

25:24.087 --> 25:26.263
Come on.

25:28.222 --> 25:31.268
[shouting][Fatima groans loudly]

25:32.705 --> 25:34.620
I'm okay.
Song?

25:34.663 --> 25:37.318
No! No!

25:41.104 --> 25:43.063
I don't know why she did that.

25:45.195 --> 25:48.721
I think maybe she thought
she was saving us.

25:49.983 --> 25:51.593
Maybe she did.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.596
A few moments later,
we heard gunshots.

25:55.945 --> 25:57.904
And that was it.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.472
We had her.

26:01.516 --> 26:03.692
We had her,

26:03.736 --> 26:06.260
and we lost her.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.567
Game over.

26:20.404 --> 26:23.669
Agent Blye, you and
Investigator Deeks were tasked

26:23.712 --> 26:26.323
with picking up and bringing
Laura Song's daughter, Lily,

26:26.367 --> 26:28.717
to your office's auxiliary
space, is that correct?

26:28.761 --> 26:31.981
Yes, that's correct,
but we call it the boatshed.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.505
What was the first thing
you did when you arrived?

26:34.549 --> 26:36.725
I called Admiral Kilbride.

26:36.769 --> 26:39.859
He wanted us to let him know
as soon as Lily was safe.

26:41.904 --> 26:45.125
Yes, sir, absolutely.

26:45.168 --> 26:47.170
Uh, hey, my boss wants
to talk to you.

26:47.214 --> 26:48.607
His name is
Admiral Kilbride.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.825
He's an old friend
of your mom's.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.479
Okay.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.002
All right, I'm gonna put him up
on the screen for you.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.744
Uh, Admiral,
I am connecting you now.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.528
Lily, hi.

26:57.572 --> 27:00.096
I'm Admiral Kilbride.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.360
I apologize to you
for talking while driving.

27:03.404 --> 27:04.623
How you doing?

27:04.666 --> 27:07.103
I'm okay, I-I'm just--

27:07.147 --> 27:09.540
I mean, these agents told me
someone made a threat

27:09.584 --> 27:11.760
against my mom,
but I don't understand

27:11.804 --> 27:13.240
why the Navy is involved.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.676
She's an art dealer.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.373
Yes, that's
how I met her.

27:16.417 --> 27:19.507
For obvious reasons I'm rather
partial to maritime art.

27:19.550 --> 27:21.509
Do you know J.M.W. Turner?

27:21.552 --> 27:23.293
Yeah.I thought you might.

27:23.337 --> 27:25.687
She said you were studying
art history at USC.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.994
Anyway, she got me a great price

27:28.037 --> 27:31.084
on one of his sketches,
and we've been close ever since.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.955
When this is over,
I'll show it to you.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.783
When will this be over?

27:37.394 --> 27:40.136
I know that you're scared,
Lily, but you're safe.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.530
And so is
your mom.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.575
I'm headed to her right now.

27:44.619 --> 27:48.144
Now, normally the FBI
would handle this, but...

27:48.188 --> 27:52.366
your mom means a lot to me so
I requested my team handle it.

27:52.409 --> 27:53.933
They are the best.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.586
I trust them
with my life.

27:56.718 --> 27:57.806
Thank you.

27:57.850 --> 28:00.679
Agent Blye, Deeks...
take care of her.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.681
We will.Absolutely, sir.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.770
All right, you okay?

28:04.813 --> 28:06.554
Yeah. I just want
to talk to my mom.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.556
I totally get that.
We'll make it happen.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.471
Hold on.

28:10.514 --> 28:11.994
Sam, hey, it's Deeks.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.344
We're here with Lily.
Is her mom available?

28:14.388 --> 28:16.520
Yeah, okay.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.435
There you go.

28:18.479 --> 28:21.395
Mom?Sweetheart, are you okay?

28:21.438 --> 28:23.397
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

28:23.440 --> 28:25.007
This is crazy.

28:25.051 --> 28:27.183
I mean, these agents
just showed up at my dorm.

28:27.227 --> 28:30.970
So that was definitely
the softer side of Kilbride.

28:31.013 --> 28:32.580
Yeah, I think he was
telling the truth, too.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.538
I think he really cares
about Laura Song.

28:34.582 --> 28:36.758
That's not even the lead story--
did you hear the part about how

28:36.802 --> 28:38.891
he said he would trust us with
his life and we're the best?

28:38.934 --> 28:40.849
Oh, honey.

28:40.893 --> 28:42.851
That part was a lie.

28:44.810 --> 28:47.029
ALI:
Why did it surprise you
that Admiral Kilbride

28:47.073 --> 28:48.770
might have cared for Laura Song?

28:48.814 --> 28:51.773
Well, let me answer that
question with another question.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.514
You ever seen The Dirty Dozen?

28:53.557 --> 28:55.255
No.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.474
Yeah, neither have I,
so let's just say

28:57.518 --> 28:59.476
Kilbride's a lot like an onion.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.043
You mean he has layers?

29:01.087 --> 29:03.829
And every single one
of them will make you cry.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.396
Okay,

29:06.440 --> 29:08.921
what happened after Lily talked
to her mother?

29:10.487 --> 29:12.663
Well, speaking of crying.

29:12.707 --> 29:15.144
[sniffling]
I'm sorry.

29:17.668 --> 29:18.974
Please, don't apologize, Lily.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.325
I just don't want
to lose her, too.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.373
"Too"? What do you mean?

29:26.416 --> 29:29.637
My dad died when I was 11.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.641
Oh.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.904
I'm so sorry, we didn't know.

29:35.948 --> 29:38.689
He was on a work trip,

29:38.733 --> 29:41.605
and there was a car crash.

29:41.649 --> 29:45.261
I was just a kid,
but I could still tell

29:45.305 --> 29:47.960
how heartbroken my mom was.

29:48.003 --> 29:50.223
I mean, she's usually so strong,

29:50.266 --> 29:53.313
like a fortress,
but losing him...

29:55.358 --> 29:57.404
...it almost destroyed her.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.668
But it sounds
like you were there for her.

30:00.711 --> 30:01.974
Right?

30:02.017 --> 30:04.367
Bet you had to
grow up pretty fast.

30:06.456 --> 30:08.894
I know she feels guilty

30:08.937 --> 30:10.983
about being away for work,

30:11.026 --> 30:13.072
but...

30:13.115 --> 30:16.075
you know, and she's away a lot.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.251
But I'm glad she has it.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.949
I mean, as soon as she went
back to work after my dad died,

30:20.993 --> 30:23.952
she got better.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.478
You're a very strong
young woman, Lily.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.443
DEEKS:
I should, um...

30:36.486 --> 30:37.705
I should check in with Sam.

30:37.748 --> 30:39.794
Yeah.

30:45.974 --> 30:47.802
ALI:
Is everything all right?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.195
What?

30:49.238 --> 30:50.587
Is everything all right?

30:50.631 --> 30:53.025
Uh...

30:53.068 --> 30:54.853
[chuckles]

30:54.896 --> 30:57.725
Yeah, as you may already know

30:57.768 --> 30:59.814
based on your fancy file
you have in front of you,

30:59.858 --> 31:01.468
Agent Blye and I

31:01.511 --> 31:03.687
are trying to adopt a child.

31:03.731 --> 31:06.342
As hopeful parents

31:06.386 --> 31:08.605
and law enforcement officers,

31:08.649 --> 31:10.564
getting killed in the line
of duty has obviously

31:10.607 --> 31:12.871
crossed our mind once or twice.

31:16.222 --> 31:19.225
And I fully recognize

31:19.268 --> 31:23.490
everyone deals with
trauma differently,

31:23.533 --> 31:25.361
but if Kensi...

31:31.628 --> 31:35.023
If Kensi, um...

31:35.067 --> 31:37.460
died, I don't...

31:39.245 --> 31:41.856
I just can't imagine
remaining operational

31:41.900 --> 31:44.511
with an 11-year-old.

31:47.601 --> 31:51.561
And yet that's exactly
what Laura Song chose to do.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.527
So I just thought
that information

32:00.570 --> 32:02.746
should be relayed to Sam.

32:02.790 --> 32:05.010
Sam, hey, it's Deeks. Listen,
we've been talking to Lily,

32:05.053 --> 32:06.576
and there's something
you should know.

32:06.620 --> 32:07.926
[disconnect tone]

32:07.969 --> 32:10.972
Sam? Sam?

32:12.974 --> 32:14.976
Damn it. Kens.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.196
Yeah.
What is it?Uh...

32:17.239 --> 32:18.980
I can't reach
the safe house on the comms,

32:19.024 --> 32:20.590
and the cameras
are off-line.

32:20.634 --> 32:21.983
Okay, well,
let's call Fatima.I already did.

32:22.027 --> 32:23.202
Nobody's picking up.

32:23.245 --> 32:24.943
Wait, what's going on?Uh, nothing.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.509
We're just having
some technical issues.[phone buzzes]

32:26.553 --> 32:27.902
Now we got
an LAPD alert.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.817
We got gunshots
and explosion in the area.

32:29.860 --> 32:30.992
Okay, stay with Lily.Yeah.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.167
I'll be right back.

32:33.125 --> 32:36.302
When I got to the safe house,
the, um...

32:36.345 --> 32:37.738
the comms had returned.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.870
The tactical team
must have retreated

32:39.914 --> 32:41.350
with the signal jammer.

32:41.394 --> 32:43.222
CALLEN:
Rountree, Fatima, do you copy?

32:43.265 --> 32:44.832
ROUNTREE:
We copy. We're stuck
in this elevator shaft.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.312
Top floor.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.488
SAM:
We're coming to get you.

32:48.531 --> 32:49.880
Guys, it's me. I just pulled up.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.447
[panting]

32:51.491 --> 32:53.667
Coming in the front door.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.759
That's where I found her.

33:00.108 --> 33:02.154
â™ª

33:12.599 --> 33:14.644
[door opens]

33:15.602 --> 33:17.256
[exhales][door closes]

33:17.299 --> 33:18.692
Thank you for being here,
Admiral.

33:18.735 --> 33:19.780
Not a problem.

33:27.744 --> 33:30.051
[exhales]

33:30.095 --> 33:31.531
Ready when you are.

33:31.574 --> 33:34.186
Okay.
[exhales]

33:34.229 --> 33:35.839
Why don't you start by
telling me what happened

33:35.883 --> 33:37.102
when you arrived
on scene.

33:37.145 --> 33:39.147
Nothing happened
when I arrived on scene.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.932
When I arrived on scene,
it was already over.

33:41.976 --> 33:44.239
Laura Song was dead.

33:46.415 --> 33:47.460
Are we done?

33:49.114 --> 33:51.594
[clears throat]
No, Admiral, we're not.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.387
What is this? I thought

34:01.430 --> 34:03.128
all the cameras
in the safe house went down.

34:03.171 --> 34:04.564
This isn't from
the safe house.

34:04.607 --> 34:06.392
It's from the construction
site across the street.

34:06.435 --> 34:08.089
You pulled up,

34:08.133 --> 34:09.656
went inside

34:09.699 --> 34:11.658
and then left.

34:11.701 --> 34:14.400
Before Agent Blye
arrived on scene.

34:14.443 --> 34:16.489
â™ª

34:19.448 --> 34:21.407
[inhales]

34:30.720 --> 34:32.896
[beeping]

34:36.161 --> 34:38.598
[inhales, exhales]

34:38.641 --> 34:40.817
Fine.

34:40.861 --> 34:43.907
You want to know
how Laura Song died?

34:45.213 --> 34:47.128
I shot her.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.174
â™ª

35:06.582 --> 35:08.062
You killed Laura Song?

35:10.195 --> 35:12.849
Based on recent intel leaks,

35:12.893 --> 35:17.811
I began to suspect that Laura
had been turned by the Chinese.

35:17.854 --> 35:20.074
But I had
to be sure.

35:22.598 --> 35:26.907
After all, she had served
our country for over 20 years.

35:26.950 --> 35:30.693
[inhales] So, in order
to secure her for interrogation,

35:30.737 --> 35:34.306
I made up that story
about her cover being blown.

35:34.349 --> 35:38.092
I had my team pick her up and
place her in protective custody.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.615
And you didn't tell them?

35:39.659 --> 35:42.618
I needed them
to play their roles perfectly.

35:42.662 --> 35:45.708
I couldn't... take the chance
that they might...

35:45.752 --> 35:47.362
give something up. Uh...

35:47.406 --> 35:50.148
They're good...

35:50.191 --> 35:52.411
but she was the best
I've ever known.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.763
When I arrived on scene,
the lobby was empty.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.853
But...

35:59.896 --> 36:02.029
then I heard them
coming downstairs.

36:02.072 --> 36:03.422
[footsteps approaching]

36:10.298 --> 36:11.778
[groaning]

36:11.821 --> 36:14.172
[groans, gasping]

36:16.652 --> 36:18.654
Drop the gun, Laura.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.266
[panting]

36:21.309 --> 36:23.442
Let me guess.
[panting]

36:23.485 --> 36:25.008
My cover's still intact.

36:25.052 --> 36:26.619
I said drop the gun.

36:26.662 --> 36:28.142
You want to know the truth,
Hollace?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.839
You think I'd believe you
after all this?

36:29.883 --> 36:31.319
[exhales]

36:31.363 --> 36:32.538
I guess not.

36:33.408 --> 36:34.975
[whimpers]

36:35.018 --> 36:36.324
[exhales]

36:36.368 --> 36:38.979
KILBRIDE:
And that's what happened.

36:39.022 --> 36:42.461
The, uh, tactical team
was not there to kill her.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.898
They were there to extract her.

36:44.941 --> 36:48.162
[inhales]
And we didn't lose an operative.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.384
I killed a traitor.
[exhales]

36:53.820 --> 36:55.213
And now that you know that,

36:55.256 --> 36:57.040
you are going to forget it.

36:58.781 --> 37:00.609
Admiral, you have
committed perjury

37:00.653 --> 37:02.916
and obstructed a
federal investigation.[sighs]

37:02.959 --> 37:05.048
I need to report
all this to SECNAV.

37:05.092 --> 37:07.007
She already knows, you idiot.

37:08.530 --> 37:09.923
Go ahead. Call her.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.185
I'll wait.

37:13.143 --> 37:15.363
I'm trusting you
to keep this confidential.

37:15.407 --> 37:16.712
Yes, ma'am.Can I trust you?

37:16.756 --> 37:18.105
Course, ma'am.Good.

37:18.148 --> 37:20.542
I fully
understand. I...[click]

37:23.502 --> 37:24.938
Happy now?

37:24.981 --> 37:26.331
I don't think
"happy" is the right word.

37:26.374 --> 37:28.333
It's already
been decided.

37:28.376 --> 37:31.118
The truth
makes us look weak.

37:31.161 --> 37:33.294
So the official story is

37:33.338 --> 37:36.297
Laura Song died a hero.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.081
So my investigation...

37:38.125 --> 37:39.474
Just a formality.

37:39.518 --> 37:40.997
If we didn't have it,

37:41.041 --> 37:44.566
my agents would be asking
a lot of questions.

37:45.654 --> 37:47.221
You have to tell them.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.310
I'm not authorized to tell them.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.964
But they blame themselves
for what happened.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.313
If they have

37:52.357 --> 37:53.836
a great need
to wallow in their angst,

37:53.880 --> 37:55.577
who am I to stand in their way?

37:55.621 --> 37:59.102
Besides, once they see
the report from Cyber Command,

37:59.146 --> 38:00.321
they'll realize

38:00.365 --> 38:01.322
they're lucky to be alive.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.019
I assume you got the report.

38:03.063 --> 38:05.065
Uh...

38:05.108 --> 38:06.458
Yes.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.764
They found a
sustained breach

38:08.808 --> 38:11.201
of the ONI safe house
security systems.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.336
The Chinese knew NCIS had Song

38:15.380 --> 38:18.208
from the moment she walked
through the safe house doors.

38:18.252 --> 38:20.472
Bottom line:
they did the best they could.

38:20.515 --> 38:23.649
And I expect to see that
in your report.

38:26.434 --> 38:30.525
And now I think
we are done here.

38:30.569 --> 38:32.135
I don't understand.[sighs]

38:33.136 --> 38:34.181
Admiral,

38:34.224 --> 38:35.661
you recruited her.

38:35.704 --> 38:37.053
You trained her. Y-You...

38:37.097 --> 38:39.447
you knew her longer than anyone.

38:39.491 --> 38:41.580
Why would she turn?

38:43.495 --> 38:46.324
That's her story to tell.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.369
â™ª

39:06.735 --> 39:09.129
[sighs]
Hey.

39:09.172 --> 39:11.523
Hey.
[exhales]

39:11.566 --> 39:12.611
How's Lily?

39:13.612 --> 39:14.874
She'll be all right.
[exhales]

39:14.917 --> 39:16.310
She's strong, like her mom.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.616
How are you guys?

39:18.617 --> 39:19.661
Not in the mood

39:19.705 --> 39:21.271
to answer any more questions.

39:21.315 --> 39:22.708
Especially that one.

39:22.751 --> 39:25.406
Yeah.

39:25.450 --> 39:26.494
[footsteps approaching]

39:31.194 --> 39:32.761
What are you still doing
down here?

39:32.805 --> 39:34.415
We have a case.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.069
Someone triedto steal

39:36.112 --> 39:38.419
a munitions supply on
its way to Pendleton.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.726
Let's find 'em

39:40.769 --> 39:42.641
before they try again.

39:44.773 --> 39:47.036

41:12.687 --> 41:14.428
I said drop the gun!

41:14.472 --> 41:16.212
You want to know the truth,
Hollace?

41:17.779 --> 41:19.651
[inhales, exhales]

41:19.694 --> 41:22.610
You didn't choose me
all those years ago.

41:22.654 --> 41:24.699
I chose you.

41:25.700 --> 41:28.529
[inhales] You were
the perfect mark.

41:28.573 --> 41:31.184
The man with the
broken family,

41:31.227 --> 41:34.013
looking for a second chance.

41:35.014 --> 41:37.277
You really think
I'd believe you after all this?
