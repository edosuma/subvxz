09:20.211 --> 09:21.561
How'd you know?

09:23.084 --> 09:25.390
Hetty's fingerprints
are all over this place.

09:26.391 --> 09:28.132
Oh, no, thanks.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.395
How long have you known Hetty?

09:31.396 --> 09:33.660
Feels like my whole life.

09:33.703 --> 09:36.358
And... you and the admiral?

09:37.359 --> 09:39.143
Feels like forever.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.190
I was born in Nanjing,

09:42.233 --> 09:44.627
but my mother was American.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.760
So when my dad died,

09:46.803 --> 09:48.196
she moved me to San Diego,

09:48.239 --> 09:51.503
which I hated at first.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.332
But I loved watching the ships.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.682
So, when I turned 17,

09:55.725 --> 09:58.032
I joined the Navy,
and that's... [inhales]

09:58.075 --> 10:00.469
where Hollace found me.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.036
I wanted to work on a ship,

10:02.079 --> 10:06.475
but he chose me
for another mission.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.955
So I guess that's fitting.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.783
He pulled me
into the world of espionage,

10:09.826 --> 10:12.307
and now he's gonna pull me out.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.308
Well,

10:13.351 --> 10:15.745
again, we don't know that.

10:18.966 --> 10:22.752
"Every operative has
an expiration date."

10:23.797 --> 10:26.495
Something Hollace
would say.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.715
Sometimes we don't...
[inhales]

10:28.758 --> 10:31.152
leave so peacefully.

10:32.806 --> 10:33.763
But we chose

10:33.807 --> 10:35.460
this life and...

10:35.504 --> 10:37.637
the risks that go with it.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.986
That's not to say

10:39.029 --> 10:39.943
that we don't take care
of our own.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.205
That's why you're here.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.686
So that
doesn't happen.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.210
I'll drink to that.[door opens]

10:46.254 --> 10:47.908
[door closes]

10:47.951 --> 10:49.213
[clears throat]

10:49.257 --> 10:50.911
Have your daughter
on the phone.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.347
Thank you,
Agent Hanna.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.218
You're welcome.

10:54.262 --> 10:56.090
Sweetheart? Are you okay?

10:57.047 --> 10:58.919
All the other floors
are secure. All good here?

10:58.962 --> 11:00.311
All good.

11:00.355 --> 11:01.443
ALI:
And how much did you drink,

11:01.486 --> 11:02.749
Agent Callen?

11:05.577 --> 11:07.362
None.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.627
What happened next?After Agent Hanna
returned,

11:11.671 --> 11:14.630
I stepped out to get an ETA
from Admiral Kilbride.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.197
I have the record
of that call.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.634
But it only lasted
three seconds.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.244
[inhales]

11:20.288 --> 11:22.769
That's because my cell service
suddenly went out,

11:22.812 --> 11:25.815
and then all of the power
went out.

11:25.859 --> 11:26.903
[door opens]

11:29.601 --> 11:30.864
I was trying you on comms.
I can't reach Fatima

11:30.907 --> 11:32.735
or Rountree either.Phones are dead, too.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.172
Yeah, I'm definitely
gonna need a gun.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.087
And did you provide
her with a firearm

11:37.131 --> 11:39.089
at that time?No.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.177
Because she had been drinking?

11:40.221 --> 11:41.091
No.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.049
Why not?

11:42.092 --> 11:43.311
Because, from my experience,

11:43.354 --> 11:45.487
putting a gun
into a protectee's hand,

11:45.530 --> 11:47.750
especially one that is, uh...

11:47.794 --> 11:50.231
trained as an operative, it...

11:50.274 --> 11:51.841
it tends to put 'em
in more danger

11:51.885 --> 11:53.625
than if they didn't have a gun.

11:54.626 --> 11:55.758
Not sure I follow.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.806
It was our job to protect Song,

11:59.849 --> 12:01.677
not hers.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.897
Giving her a gun would have
just been an invitation

12:03.940 --> 12:06.421
for her to take
unnecessary risks.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.163
Not that...

12:09.206 --> 12:10.947
that stopped her.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.776
Lights are still on
across the street.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.604
It's just us.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.911
We're gonna need to get
her to the panic room.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.219
Song!

12:22.263 --> 12:23.960
Get back here!

12:24.004 --> 12:25.962
I'm not sitting around
in the dark.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.311
We need information.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.705
What we need is for you
to get in the panic room.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.750
I told you,

12:30.793 --> 12:32.012
I'm not getting in that room.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.535
[screams]

12:35.537 --> 12:37.408
So after you finished
your perimeter check,

12:37.452 --> 12:38.714
you returned to the apartment.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.194
What happened then?

12:41.195 --> 12:43.414
Agent Callen stepped
out to make a call.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.460
I kept watch in the apartment.

12:46.417 --> 12:50.117
Song was talking to her daughter
on the phone in the bedroom.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.294
And what was her state of mind
after the call?

12:54.991 --> 12:56.863
It's not easy
protecting your family

12:56.906 --> 12:58.168
from the dangers of the job.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.257
I know
from firsthand experience.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.566
It can take a toll.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.394
[footsteps approaching]

13:07.395 --> 13:09.484
[inhales]

13:09.527 --> 13:11.355
Thank you.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.880
Of course.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.273
[sighs]

13:17.753 --> 13:20.800
Maybe this is a...
blessing in disguise.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.326
If my career is over,
I can spend more time

13:25.369 --> 13:27.328
with my daughter.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.851
I've already missed so much.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.766
Mm.Her teachers
at boarding school

13:30.810 --> 13:32.463
have been more of a mother
to her than I have.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.552
Now I have to bribe her
with gifts just to get her

13:34.596 --> 13:36.337
to have dinner with me.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.993
But the truth is
she's fine.

13:40.036 --> 13:43.910
She's probably, um,
better off without me.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.694
Mm, you can't
think that way.

13:45.737 --> 13:48.305
She'll pull away more
and so will you.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.221
No matter how hard she makes it,

13:51.265 --> 13:53.963
you got to keep trying.

13:54.007 --> 13:56.357
How old is your daughter,
Agent Hanna?

13:57.706 --> 13:58.968
She's the same age as yours.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.013
She went to
boarding school, too.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.885
Does she get along
with her mother?

14:05.061 --> 14:06.628
She did.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.806
Her mom died.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.417
Oh. I'm sorry.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.337
[exhales]
How did it happen?

14:21.382 --> 14:23.340
[inhales]

14:23.384 --> 14:25.777
Line of duty.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.954
She was CIA.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.826
"Every operative..."

14:30.870 --> 14:32.262
I'm sorry?

14:33.568 --> 14:35.091
Nothing.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.878
ALI:
Was Laura Song drinking,

14:38.921 --> 14:41.010
Agent Hanna?

14:42.272 --> 14:43.839
[scoffs softly, inhales]

14:43.883 --> 14:45.232
There was a bottle of bourbon
on the coffee table.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.886
I didn't see her drink any.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.409
I'm sorry... bourbon?

14:48.452 --> 14:50.541
That's correct.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.369
Not scotch?

14:52.413 --> 14:54.284
It was bourbon.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.808
Your partner said it was scotch.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.462
It was bourbon.

14:58.506 --> 14:59.594
You're sure?

15:00.943 --> 15:02.684
Well, you know you can
check it out if you want.

15:02.727 --> 15:03.946
The bottle must
still be in the room.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.382
It's probably in
a million pieces.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.688
But if it's
really that important to you

15:06.731 --> 15:08.168
whether it's scotch or bourbon,

15:08.211 --> 15:10.300
I'm sure
you can glue 'em back together.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.042
[clears throat]

15:14.348 --> 15:15.566
What happened next?

15:15.610 --> 15:17.655
I got a call.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.919
Deeks, what's up?Hey, Sam, it's Deeks.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.529
Listen, we've been talking
to Lily, there's something

15:21.572 --> 15:23.487
you should know.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.663
Sam...
[signal breaking up]

15:25.707 --> 15:27.665
Deeks?

15:27.709 --> 15:29.580
What happened?

15:31.147 --> 15:33.628
G, you copy?

15:33.671 --> 15:35.543
Fatima? Rountree?

15:35.586 --> 15:37.414
Y-You can't reach anyone?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.678
I think I'm gonna need a gun.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.072
Agent Hanna,
did you give her a firearm?

15:43.116 --> 15:44.987
No, I did not.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.554
Why is that?

15:46.597 --> 15:48.121
'Cause the situation
didn't warrant it.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.210
We weren't under attack.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.125
But that quickly changed.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.301
CALLEN:
Song, get back here.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.868
Your agents are in trouble.
We need to find them.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.000
They can take care
of themselves.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.001
We need to get you
to the panic room.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.568
I'm not getting in that room!

16:01.569 --> 16:02.787
[grunts]

16:06.574 --> 16:08.010
Come with me!

16:08.054 --> 16:09.969
What about Hanna?

16:19.891 --> 16:22.851
[gunfire continues]

16:22.894 --> 16:23.895
You left me!

16:23.939 --> 16:25.158
I had to get her
to the panic room!

16:26.420 --> 16:27.899
Do I have to do everything
myself around here?

16:27.943 --> 16:29.901
I can help. Give me a gun.

16:29.945 --> 16:32.556
Now did the situation warrant
giving her a firearm?

16:32.600 --> 16:35.081
No, the situation warranted
getting her in the panic room.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.299
But she refused.

16:36.343 --> 16:38.258
That wasn't gonna stop me.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.521
We need to get you
to the safe room.No! Let go of me!

16:41.130 --> 16:43.089
CALLEN:
Sam!

16:43.132 --> 16:45.178
[grunts]

16:49.182 --> 16:51.184
[gunfire]

16:59.453 --> 17:01.281
Sam!

17:07.069 --> 17:09.724
When I came to, it was over.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.599
Song was dead.

17:15.643 --> 17:16.687
Do you still believe you made

17:16.731 --> 17:19.560
the right decision
not to arm her?

17:19.603 --> 17:22.389
Yes.Yes.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.260
But that doesn't mean
I don't take responsibility

17:24.304 --> 17:26.045
for what happened.CALLEN:
Laura Song should not

17:26.088 --> 17:28.612
have needed a gun in her hand
to protect herself.

17:28.656 --> 17:31.137
That was our job.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.877
And we failed.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.415
Agent Rountree,

17:48.458 --> 17:50.243
you and Agent Namazi
were covering

17:50.286 --> 17:52.158
the ground floor,
watching the security monitors.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.116
How did the evening begin?

17:54.160 --> 17:55.857
We performed the required
perimeter checks

17:55.900 --> 17:58.120
and reported back
to Agents Callen and Hanna.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.035
But there wasn't much to say.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.297
It was pretty quiet.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.691
So what did you do
to pass the time?

18:03.734 --> 18:05.867
Well, as an FBI agent,

18:05.910 --> 18:08.783
I've been on plenty of
stakeouts, so I knew to always

18:08.826 --> 18:11.829
bring something--
you know, a book, some music.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.962
And that night,

18:14.005 --> 18:16.269
I had magnets.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.358
[monitors blipping]

18:22.536 --> 18:24.451
Psst. It's your turn.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.412
Oh, sorry.

18:29.456 --> 18:32.111
Well, I've officially
missed my date at L'Ardoise.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.982
I don't think you
missed out on anything.

18:34.025 --> 18:36.593
Not the food
and especially not the guy.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.421
What are you talking about?
I like Ben.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.597
Do you?

18:40.641 --> 18:43.209
You act like it's a chore every
time you meet up with this guy.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.126
Oh, damn it!

18:47.169 --> 18:49.780
The trick is
to use the magnetic field

18:49.824 --> 18:51.173
to your advantage.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.219
Well, right now,
they're repelling me.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.699
And it's time for me
to go do my thing anyways.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.179
Put in a good word for me.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.876
Yeah, we'll see.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.139
"Her thing"?

19:00.182 --> 19:02.445
Uh, sorry. Prayers.

19:02.489 --> 19:05.144
Faith is a pretty important part
of Agent Namazi's life.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.930
So, she left her post

19:08.973 --> 19:10.410
to attend to a personal matter.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.368
Well...

19:12.412 --> 19:14.065
I mean, nothing was happening.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.937
I mean...

19:15.980 --> 19:18.244
I mean, even if something did,
she was on comms,

19:18.287 --> 19:20.376
So...And did anything happen?

19:22.248 --> 19:23.771
[sighs]

19:25.773 --> 19:27.514
What the...?

19:27.557 --> 19:29.777
I didn't touch anything.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.866
Was that the magnets?

19:33.259 --> 19:34.825
Oh, hell no.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.392
Fatima, we just lost power.

19:36.436 --> 19:37.959
Comms is rerouted
through the system.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.787
And once we lost power,
it's supposed to migrate

19:39.830 --> 19:42.790
back to the cell towers,
but that didn't happen.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.705
That's when I realized
they must've been using

19:44.748 --> 19:46.054
a powerful signal jammer.

19:46.097 --> 19:48.970
Callen, Sam? Anybody, copy?

19:49.013 --> 19:50.711
Hey.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.800
We got company.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.153
Here, let me help you.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.286
No, it's...
I'm all good, thanks.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.202
Oh...

20:03.245 --> 20:05.247
Here you go.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.382
Thank you.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.734
[door closes]

20:16.911 --> 20:19.087
Agent Namazi,

20:19.130 --> 20:21.350
I'm ONI Inspector General
Akhil Ali.

20:21.394 --> 20:23.439
Thank you
for being here.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.136
How's your leg?

20:25.180 --> 20:28.052
Uh, annoying,
but it's getting better.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.881
I actually have a doctor's
appointment after this.

20:30.925 --> 20:33.667
That's good. I'll try
not to keep you too long.

20:33.710 --> 20:36.104
I've been reviewing your file.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.237
It's, uh, very impressive.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.978
You've accomplished so much
for someone your age.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.807
And to give up
a lucrative television career

20:43.851 --> 20:46.332
for civil service,
it's really...

20:49.073 --> 20:51.250
Well, anyway...

20:51.293 --> 20:54.296
uh, I thought we could start
from just after you returned

20:54.340 --> 20:56.820
from the top floor apartment,
when you and Agent Rountree

20:56.864 --> 20:59.736
were on watch-- he mentioned
you were playing a game?

20:59.780 --> 21:01.303
Yeah, yeah.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.740
And I was kind of crushing it.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.047
Ha!
Gah!

21:06.090 --> 21:07.570
Magnets!Oh, come on,

21:07.614 --> 21:09.529
Tree, don't you know
that opposites attract?

21:13.794 --> 21:16.100
Oh, you missed your dinner date.

21:16.144 --> 21:18.189
Oh, don't worry about it.
I think you were right.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.279
I wasn't that excited to go.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.237
Plus I don't think
Ben's my type.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.891
ALI:
Why not?

21:23.934 --> 21:25.196
What?

21:25.240 --> 21:28.069
Why, uh...
why wasn't he your type?

21:29.331 --> 21:31.507
I'm... not sure

21:31.551 --> 21:33.770
I see how that's relevant.

21:33.814 --> 21:36.469
Is it... relevant?

21:36.512 --> 21:39.298
We'll circle back to that.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.778
Uh, what happened

21:41.822 --> 21:43.606
after you played the game?

21:43.650 --> 21:46.435
Uh, then I left

21:46.479 --> 21:48.785
to perform the first prayers
of the Muslim day.

21:48.829 --> 21:51.135
Now is prayer
something you always

21:51.179 --> 21:52.615
make time for
while on assignment?

21:52.659 --> 21:54.225
When reasonable.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.359
My faith makes me
a stronger person

21:57.403 --> 21:59.056
and a better agent.

22:02.582 --> 22:05.236
I-I admire that.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.501
I'm Muslim myself.

22:08.544 --> 22:11.460
But not as devout
as I'd like to be.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.506
It's, um...

22:13.549 --> 22:15.551
it's not easy.

22:15.595 --> 22:18.119
No, it's not.

22:18.162 --> 22:20.077
But it can be rewarding.

22:21.470 --> 22:24.038
Uh, s-so you did your prayers?

22:24.081 --> 22:27.302
Yeah, and that's when I saw
the first sign of trouble.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.435
[praying in Arabic]

22:32.176 --> 22:34.222
[continues in Arabic]

22:42.970 --> 22:45.842
Rountree, I've got movement on
the south side of the building.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.931
You see anything on the cameras?

22:49.324 --> 22:50.978
Rountree, do you copy?

22:58.072 --> 23:00.379
Hey, we got company.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.468
Yeah, comms are down.I saw two shadows on
the south side of the building.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.295
We need to get
to the others.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.781
[soft clattering nearby]

23:11.825 --> 23:13.609
What was that?Came from the door.

23:15.176 --> 23:17.004
Be careful.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.750
Move!

23:31.801 --> 23:33.673
[gunfire]

23:42.682 --> 23:45.815
Agent Rountree and I managed
to take out several operatives

23:45.859 --> 23:48.122
downstairs. I'm not even
exactly sure how many.

23:48.165 --> 23:51.168
We were quickly overwhelmed and
had to retreat to the top floor.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.780
And that's where we ran
into Laura Song.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.175
[screams]

23:58.219 --> 23:59.525
Are you okay?

23:59.568 --> 24:01.440
Get back! Get back!

24:03.746 --> 24:06.227
This way! This way!

24:06.270 --> 24:07.750
Take cover!

24:12.494 --> 24:14.017
FATIMA:
Rountree, hurry!

24:15.018 --> 24:16.063
We can't stay here!

24:16.106 --> 24:18.369
[grunts][gunshots]

24:27.378 --> 24:29.511
Come on.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.646
Come on!

24:35.735 --> 24:37.867
[Fatima shouts]

24:37.911 --> 24:39.347
Aah!

24:46.615 --> 24:48.661
Aah!

24:49.966 --> 24:52.534
[groans]
Oh, that hurts!

24:52.578 --> 24:54.275
Let me see where you're hit.[winces]

24:54.318 --> 24:55.929
We don't have time.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.322
We can't stay here, either.

25:02.675 --> 25:05.155
Oh, that hurts.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.203
Oh, this hurts.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.944
[panting]

25:10.987 --> 25:12.598
[grunts]

25:12.641 --> 25:15.470
[muffled shouting nearby]They're coming in!

25:15.514 --> 25:17.646
Song.You go-- you're injured.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.518
No way. You first.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.563
[shouting]There's no time to argue.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.044
Go![grunting]

25:24.087 --> 25:26.263
Come on.

25:28.222 --> 25:31.268
[shouting][Fatima groans loudly]

25:32.705 --> 25:34.620
I'm okay.
Song?

25:34.663 --> 25:37.318
No! No!

25:41.104 --> 25:43.063
I don't know why she did that.

25:45.195 --> 25:48.721
I think maybe she thought
she was saving us.

25:49.983 --> 25:51.593
Maybe she did.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.596
A few moments later,
we heard gunshots.

25:55.945 --> 25:57.904
And that was it.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.472
We had her.

26:01.516 --> 26:03.692
We had her,

26:03.736 --> 26:06.260
and we lost her.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.567
Game over.

26:20.404 --> 26:23.669
Agent Blye, you and
Investigator Deeks were tasked

26:23.712 --> 26:26.323
with picking up and bringing
Laura Song's daughter, Lily,

26:26.367 --> 26:28.717
to your office's auxiliary
space, is that correct?

26:28.761 --> 26:31.981
Yes, that's correct,
but we call it the boatshed.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.505
What was the first thing
you did when you arrived?

26:34.549 --> 26:36.725
I called Admiral Kilbride.

26:36.769 --> 26:39.859
He wanted us to let him know
as soon as Lily was safe.

26:41.904 --> 26:45.125
Yes, sir, absolutely.

26:45.168 --> 26:47.170
Uh, hey, my boss wants
to talk to you.

26:47.214 --> 26:48.607
His name is
Admiral Kilbride.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.825
He's an old friend
of your mom's.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.479
Okay.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.002
All right, I'm gonna put him up
on the screen for you.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.744
Uh, Admiral,
I am connecting you now.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.528
Lily, hi.

26:57.572 --> 27:00.096
I'm Admiral Kilbride.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.360
I apologize to you
for talking while driving.

27:03.404 --> 27:04.623
How you doing?

27:04.666 --> 27:07.103
I'm okay, I-I'm just--

27:07.147 --> 27:09.540
I mean, these agents told me
someone made a threat

27:09.584 --> 27:11.760
against my mom,
but I don't understand

27:11.804 --> 27:13.240
why the Navy is involved.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.676
She's an art dealer.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.373
Yes, that's
how I met her.

27:16.417 --> 27:19.507
For obvious reasons I'm rather
partial to maritime art.

27:19.550 --> 27:21.509
Do you know J.M.W. Turner?

27:21.552 --> 27:23.293
Yeah.I thought you might.

27:23.337 --> 27:25.687
She said you were studying
art history at USC.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.994
Anyway, she got me a great price

27:28.037 --> 27:31.084
on one of his sketches,
and we've been close ever since.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.955
When this is over,
I'll show it to you.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.783
When will this be over?

27:37.394 --> 27:40.136
I know that you're scared,
Lily, but you're safe.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.530
And so is
your mom.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.575
I'm headed to her right now.

27:44.619 --> 27:48.144
Now, normally the FBI
would handle this, but...

27:48.188 --> 27:52.366
your mom means a lot to me so
I requested my team handle it.

27:52.409 --> 27:53.933
They are the best.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.586
I trust them
with my life.

27:56.718 --> 27:57.806
Thank you.

27:57.850 --> 28:00.679
Agent Blye, Deeks...
take care of her.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.681
We will.Absolutely, sir.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.770
All right, you okay?

28:04.813 --> 28:06.554
Yeah. I just want
to talk to my mom.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.556
I totally get that.
We'll make it happen.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.471
Hold on.

28:10.514 --> 28:11.994
Sam, hey, it's Deeks.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.344
We're here with Lily.
Is her mom available?

28:14.388 --> 28:16.520
Yeah, okay.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.435
There you go.

28:18.479 --> 28:21.395
Mom?Sweetheart, are you okay?

28:21.438 --> 28:23.397
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

28:23.440 --> 28:25.007
This is crazy.

28:25.051 --> 28:27.183
I mean, these agents
just showed up at my dorm.

28:27.227 --> 28:30.970
So that was definitely
the softer side of Kilbride.

28:31.013 --> 28:32.580
Yeah, I think he was
telling the truth, too.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.538
I think he really cares
about Laura Song.

28:34.582 --> 28:36.758
That's not even the lead story--
did you hear the part about how

28:36.802 --> 28:38.891
he said he would trust us with
his life and we're the best?

28:38.934 --> 28:40.849
Oh, honey.

28:40.893 --> 28:42.851
That part was a lie.

28:44.810 --> 28:47.029
ALI:
Why did it surprise you
that Admiral Kilbride

28:47.073 --> 28:48.770
might have cared for Laura Song?

28:48.814 --> 28:51.773
Well, let me answer that
question with another question.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.514
You ever seen The Dirty Dozen?

28:53.557 --> 28:55.255
No.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.474
Yeah, neither have I,
so let's just say

28:57.518 --> 28:59.476
Kilbride's a lot like an onion.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.043
You mean he has layers?

29:01.087 --> 29:03.829
And every single one
of them will make you cry.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.396
Okay,

29:06.440 --> 29:08.921
what happened after Lily talked
to her mother?

29:10.487 --> 29:12.663
Well, speaking of crying.

29:12.707 --> 29:15.144
[sniffling]
I'm sorry.

29:17.668 --> 29:18.974
Please, don't apologize, Lily.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.325
I just don't want
to lose her, too.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.373
"Too"? What do you mean?

29:26.416 --> 29:29.637
My dad died when I was 11.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.641
Oh.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.904
I'm so sorry, we didn't know.

29:35.948 --> 29:38.689
He was on a work trip,

29:38.733 --> 29:41.605
and there was a car crash.

29:41.649 --> 29:45.261
I was just a kid,
but I could still tell

29:45.305 --> 29:47.960
how heartbroken my mom was.

29:48.003 --> 29:50.223
I mean, she's usually so strong,

29:50.266 --> 29:53.313
like a fortress,
but losing him...

29:55.358 --> 29:57.404
...it almost destroyed her.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.668
But it sounds
like you were there for her.

30:00.711 --> 30:01.974
Right?

30:02.017 --> 30:04.367
Bet you had to
grow up pretty fast.

30:06.456 --> 30:08.894
I know she feels guilty

30:08.937 --> 30:10.983
about being away for work,

30:11.026 --> 30:13.072
but...

30:13.115 --> 30:16.075
you know, and she's away a lot.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.251
But I'm glad she has it.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.949
I mean, as soon as she went
back to work after my dad died,

30:20.993 --> 30:23.952
she got better.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.478
You're a very strong
young woman, Lily.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.443
DEEKS:
I should, um...

30:36.486 --> 30:37.705
I should check in with Sam.

30:37.748 --> 30:39.794
Yeah.

30:45.974 --> 30:47.802
ALI:
Is everything all right?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.195
What?

30:49.238 --> 30:50.587
Is everything all right?

30:50.631 --> 30:53.025
Uh...

30:53.068 --> 30:54.853
[chuckles]

30:54.896 --> 30:57.725
Yeah, as you may already know

30:57.768 --> 30:59.814
based on your fancy file
you have in front of you,

30:59.858 --> 31:01.468
Agent Blye and I

31:01.511 --> 31:03.687
are trying to adopt a child.

31:03.731 --> 31:06.342
As hopeful parents

31:06.386 --> 31:08.605
and law enforcement officers,

31:08.649 --> 31:10.564
getting killed in the line
of duty has obviously

31:10.607 --> 31:12.871
crossed our mind once or twice.

31:16.222 --> 31:19.225
And I fully recognize

31:19.268 --> 31:23.490
everyone deals with
trauma differently,

31:23.533 --> 31:25.361
but if Kensi...

31:31.628 --> 31:35.023
If Kensi, um...

31:35.067 --> 31:37.460
died, I don't...

31:39.245 --> 31:41.856
I just can't imagine
remaining operational

31:41.900 --> 31:44.511
with an 11-year-old.

31:47.601 --> 31:51.561
And yet that's exactly
what Laura Song chose to do.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.527
So I just thought
that information

32:00.570 --> 32:02.746
