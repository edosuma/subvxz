08:20.241 --> 08:23.000
I just forgot to lay down.
I forgot to lay down.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.517
You can't roast him.

08:24.517 --> 08:26.379
He's so bad.
It's so harsh.

08:26.379 --> 08:27.931
It's hard to roast somebody
that has no shame.

08:27.931 --> 08:30.241
You can't roast this guy.
He's unroastable.

08:30.241 --> 08:31.758
I would roast you,
but you already look like

08:31.758 --> 08:34.448
you've been on fire
for like 50 days.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.620
This puts it out.
This puts the fire out.

08:36.620 --> 08:38.793
You stutter so much,
we'll call you "Mumbles" now.

08:38.793 --> 08:39.965
What was that, "Sanitation"?
What was that?

08:44.931 --> 08:46.379
My Uncle Nino just, like,
calls people

08:46.379 --> 08:47.827
random things all the time.

08:47.827 --> 08:49.586
Like, I think he just, like,
doesn't speak English.

08:49.586 --> 08:50.655
I don't know. He doesn't
speak Italian, either.

08:50.655 --> 08:51.931
I don't know what he speaks.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.793
I call that "Sanitation."

08:53.793 --> 08:55.172
Mother.

08:55.172 --> 08:56.448
The first time
he came to Miami,

08:56.448 --> 08:58.655
he was calling Mike
"Mike the Sanitation,"

08:58.655 --> 09:00.068
instead of "The Situation."

09:00.068 --> 09:01.724
Oh, Mike the Sanitation.

09:01.724 --> 09:04.379
"Hey, Sanitation,
Sanitation."

09:04.379 --> 09:06.551
Let's make a toast
to my new family.

09:06.551 --> 09:09.724
Knockout Ronnie, Pauly Spike,
Mike Sanitation...

09:11.034 --> 09:14.137
But now he's
"Mike the Litigation."

09:14.137 --> 09:15.931
How 'bout you,
you fatboy?

09:19.448 --> 09:21.413
Why does he
call you fat?

09:21.413 --> 09:23.551
Look at him.
Fat muscles.

09:25.586 --> 09:28.896
Fat muscles. Oh!

09:28.896 --> 09:30.551
I can probably
take my apron off.

09:30.551 --> 09:32.413
Yeah, relax.

09:32.413 --> 09:35.172
You tired, girls?

09:35.172 --> 09:36.448
A little bit.

09:36.448 --> 09:38.275
That meal,
everything that you did...

09:38.275 --> 09:39.448
Mm-hmm. I feel like

09:39.448 --> 09:40.620
I was back home.Yeah.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.275
It was so yummy.It was so good.

09:42.275 --> 09:44.551
Yo, I didn't realize that
we have coconuts on our trees.

09:44.551 --> 09:45.655
Oh, look...

09:47.586 --> 09:49.000
Yeah, what does that mean?They're ripe, they're ripe.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.241
They're ripe?Give me a rope.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.275
I'll climb the
tree right now.

09:52.275 --> 09:53.379
A rope?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.137
I need to get me
some of them coconuts.

10:00.137 --> 10:01.827
My old lady's coming soon.

10:01.827 --> 10:03.482
You'll get  like
rock whiteout.

10:04.724 --> 10:07.172
I'm gonna give
Uncle Nino a coconut.

10:10.689 --> 10:12.586
That's kind of brown,
though.This is brown?

10:12.586 --> 10:14.758
Go. Cut the top and
drink that  thing.

10:14.758 --> 10:16.137
I'll get a butcher knife.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.103
Yo, get the-- get
the knife sharpener, too.

10:20.344 --> 10:22.034
'Cause he wants
to get some foods.

10:22.034 --> 10:23.793
Yeah. That's why
he volunteered to go in.

10:26.241 --> 10:29.275
You deserve to be pampered
the way you pamper us.

10:29.275 --> 10:32.344
I used to always make fun
of Vinny for like being homesick

10:32.344 --> 10:34.758
and wanting to be with
his mom and not moving out.

10:34.758 --> 10:36.344
I want my son
to be like that.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.068
And now I have kids and
I'm like, you are not leaving.

10:38.068 --> 10:39.586
You are not allowed to date.

10:39.586 --> 10:41.896
You are not allowed
to move away for college.

10:41.896 --> 10:43.896
When you think of moms,
I don't think of me and Nicole.

10:43.896 --> 10:46.724
I think of, like, Paula.
She's like the cleaning fairy.

10:46.724 --> 10:49.551
She's the ultimate chef.
She is, like,

10:49.551 --> 10:51.758
mom goals for me and Nicole.

10:51.758 --> 10:54.206
I am gonna be Paula
when I grow up with my kids.

10:54.206 --> 10:56.689
You're the best.
I look up to you,
being a mom.

10:56.689 --> 10:57.793
What are you doing?

10:57.793 --> 10:59.413
Trying to open up
a coconut.

10:59.413 --> 11:01.793
Oh, my God.
I'd be careful.

11:01.793 --> 11:03.482
Why with a knife, Mike?

11:03.482 --> 11:04.827
I don't know how else
we'd open it.

11:04.827 --> 11:07.000
What do you mean?
You bang it on the floor.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.586
Take a pot.A pot?

11:08.586 --> 11:10.517
A heavy pot.
You're gonna end up

11:10.517 --> 11:12.827
cutting your finger off
before you propose.

11:12.827 --> 11:14.310
He's a mess.

11:14.310 --> 11:17.448
He's gonna kill himself.

11:17.448 --> 11:18.793
We gotta go see
what they're doing.

11:18.793 --> 11:20.275
He's gonna cut his arm off.Gonna go somewhere.

11:22.206 --> 11:24.551
What are you gonna try to do?
Squish it like a bug?

11:24.551 --> 11:25.965
No. Paula said
to  bang it,
and it should crack open.

11:25.965 --> 11:27.241
No. Never.

11:27.241 --> 11:28.965
Michael, you gotta
cut through the skin.

11:28.965 --> 11:30.896
After that, there's
a  shell.

11:30.896 --> 11:32.000
A sledgehammer.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.620
Bash it really hard.

11:34.620 --> 11:35.724
Hard as a .

11:35.724 --> 11:37.034
Hard, hard,
hard, hard, hard.

11:39.137 --> 11:40.620
Oh, almost.Yeah. Wow!

11:42.655 --> 11:43.758
Keep going, Michael.
Keep going.

11:44.827 --> 11:45.896
Oh, there. Almost.

11:45.896 --> 11:47.310
Oh, I bent the pan.

11:47.310 --> 11:48.724
Come on, Mike!

11:48.724 --> 11:50.172
You go ahead,
you go ahead.

11:50.172 --> 11:52.482
You aren't thinking.
You aren't concentrating.

11:52.482 --> 11:55.655
If we're ever
stranded on an island,
we are .

11:55.655 --> 11:58.551
Ronnie, you try.
Let Ronnie do it.Let Ronnie do it.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.827
Ron. There you go,
chubby.

12:00.827 --> 12:02.137
He calls him "chubby."

12:02.137 --> 12:05.103
Chunky, chunky.
Chunky, chunky mother.

12:05.103 --> 12:06.793
Go easy on the guy.

12:06.793 --> 12:09.068
Like you mean it.
Hit it like you mean it.

12:09.068 --> 12:10.275
Like a mother.

12:10.275 --> 12:11.413
Oh, God.

12:11.413 --> 12:12.551
It's broken.

12:15.689 --> 12:18.034
One, two...Oh!

12:18.034 --> 12:20.862
That was like
a wimpy mother.

12:20.862 --> 12:23.482
Mike, get back there.
He sucks.

12:23.482 --> 12:25.793
Now I see why coconut water
is so damn expensive.

12:25.793 --> 12:27.620
Hit the mother.You got it, keep going.

12:27.620 --> 12:29.068
You got it.
I see it. You got it.

12:29.068 --> 12:31.000
Watch yourself, honey.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.413
Yeah, there you go.

12:32.413 --> 12:33.724
Put the tip in.

12:37.793 --> 12:41.551
How many guidos does it take
to open up a coconut? Hmm.

12:42.965 --> 12:45.137
Hey, we have juice.Thank my son.

12:47.655 --> 12:48.931
A lot.

12:48.931 --> 12:50.275
Did your mom proud.

12:50.275 --> 12:51.793
Vinny would save us all.Yeah.

12:51.793 --> 12:53.689
They should sell...
Do they sell a coconut opener?

12:55.620 --> 12:58.448
♪ Paradise,
you will come ♪

12:58.448 --> 13:00.103
♪ On our way at last... ♪

13:00.103 --> 13:02.724
Thank you, guys,
for cooking for my mom.

13:02.724 --> 13:04.724
Of course.
Duh.

13:04.724 --> 13:07.344
We want to present
Paula and Uncle Nino

13:07.344 --> 13:09.724
with the best breakfast
spread ever.

13:09.724 --> 13:13.827
Bacon, sausage, eggs,
bagels, muffins.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.344
We all want Paula
to feel appreciated.

13:16.344 --> 13:17.517
Thank you so much
for cleaning.

13:17.517 --> 13:19.206
Thank you for cleaning
the whole house.

13:19.206 --> 13:20.551
What a wonderful thing
to come home to.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.068
That was like the best.You are the best.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.344
Four hours, four hours.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.862
Uncle Nino, so since
you have four kids

13:26.862 --> 13:28.827
and you've been
through 13 marriages,

13:28.827 --> 13:30.275
do you have
any advice for me?

13:30.275 --> 13:32.551
I wouldn't say get parenting
advice from Uncle Nino.

13:32.551 --> 13:34.310
He just met his son,
like, yesterday.

13:36.241 --> 13:38.068
Ah, the modern family.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.655
Ronnie,
that's your future.

13:39.655 --> 13:41.034
If you keep spiraling,

13:41.034 --> 13:42.413
you're gonna be this guy,
Uncle Nino.

13:42.413 --> 13:44.620
Come here, Ronnie.What?

13:44.620 --> 13:47.241
Yeah. Why don't you tell me
about your girlfriend?

13:47.241 --> 13:48.758
We're getting closer
to the end of this

13:48.758 --> 13:51.586
and I'm going home
to a lot of stuff.

13:51.586 --> 13:53.068
I'm going home
to a lot of pressure.

13:53.068 --> 13:55.862
I have my baby's mother
at home, you know,

13:55.862 --> 13:57.517
and the longer I stay here,
it's not like

13:57.517 --> 13:59.413
she's getting less pregnant,
she's getting more pregnant.

13:59.413 --> 14:01.103
I moved to Vegas for her.

14:01.103 --> 14:03.137
Yeah, I, I...
Oh, from L.A.,
you went to Vegas.

14:03.137 --> 14:05.827
Yeah. And then, literally,
about a week or two

14:05.827 --> 14:07.482
after being there,
she's like, "I'm pregnant,"

14:07.482 --> 14:10.137
and I was like, "Oh!"Oh!

14:10.137 --> 14:12.344
Yeah.
Once you have the baby,

14:12.344 --> 14:14.172
it's the most beautiful thing,
you know what I mean?

14:14.172 --> 14:17.172
My main focus is, right now,
is being a good father.

14:17.172 --> 14:19.172
Some people think,
oh, you have to get married.

14:19.172 --> 14:21.275
I really don't believe
in getting married.

14:21.275 --> 14:24.275
Eventually, maybe, whatever,
but, you know, I tell my kids,

14:24.275 --> 14:27.793
you know, you take your time
and-- Because people change.

14:27.793 --> 14:31.448
Like, who I was ten years ago,
that's not who I am today.

14:31.448 --> 14:33.310
Yeah, same.You know what I mean?
People change.

14:33.310 --> 14:34.827
It's just nature,
you know what I mean?

14:34.827 --> 14:37.000
Nothing wrong with
the person, you know?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.310
But you just gotta
take your time.

14:39.310 --> 14:40.655
'Cause nobody's
going anywhere.

14:40.655 --> 14:42.310
She's having your baby.It's true.

14:42.310 --> 14:44.517
You know? And you'll
always have that bond.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.517
The real test will come
after the baby's out.Yes.

14:47.517 --> 14:50.241
Everything that
I've been thinking about

14:50.241 --> 14:52.724
and anticipating is, like,
gonna happen now, you know?

14:52.724 --> 14:53.862
Like, it's, like, it's real.

14:53.862 --> 14:55.551
This is, like, real life.

14:55.551 --> 14:56.689
Like, this
is happening.

14:56.689 --> 14:58.172
Uh, your car is here.

14:58.172 --> 14:59.448
Thanks for interrupting
my mom...

14:59.448 --> 15:01.620
Yeah, Vin!...and son conversation, bro.

15:01.620 --> 15:02.827
I know.I know you get jealous.

15:02.827 --> 15:05.275
I am really jealous.
Stop. Enough, all right?

15:06.413 --> 15:07.758
But thank you, Paula,
I appreciate it.

15:07.758 --> 15:09.068
Oh, of course.
I love you.

15:09.068 --> 15:10.517
I love you too.

15:10.517 --> 15:12.896
I'm just nervous
about moving forward

15:12.896 --> 15:14.931
and being a father and,
like, all the stuff

15:14.931 --> 15:17.482
that is happening
when I leave here.

15:17.482 --> 15:19.758
And I still have to go home
to tons and tons and tons

15:19.758 --> 15:22.379
of responsibilities,
and that's the next chapter

15:22.379 --> 15:24.724
to my life, you know?
And it's a scary thing.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.965
I'll see you real soon.

15:26.965 --> 15:28.689
Thank you so much
for everything.

15:28.689 --> 15:32.931
Thank you for your breakfast
again. Mwah, mwah, mwah.

15:32.931 --> 15:34.689
Love you.Love you more.

15:34.689 --> 15:36.689
Good luck.
You're the best.Thank you.

15:36.689 --> 15:38.172
If you need anything,

15:38.172 --> 15:39.655
I got a lot of guys
on the inside, so...

15:39.655 --> 15:41.689
All right. Thank you.

15:41.689 --> 15:43.172
Goodbye, family!Bye.

15:43.172 --> 15:45.620
Bye-bye.
Love youse all.
Bye!

15:45.620 --> 15:48.206
I love my mom,
I love my family,

15:48.206 --> 15:50.620
and I'm away from home
for a little while.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.310
It means a lot
that they made the trip

15:52.310 --> 15:55.172
all the way from New York to
come here just to make me happy.

15:55.172 --> 15:57.000
Bye.Have fun, okay?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.344
Thanks for coming.

15:58.344 --> 16:00.137
Plus, Uncle Nino,

to her at all?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.758
I mean, obviously,
she's gonna say, "I love you

16:53.758 --> 16:55.758
and I want to be with you,"
but it's like, truthfully,

16:55.758 --> 16:57.758
I just don't trust her,
so I'm more worried about,

16:57.758 --> 16:59.724
like, what happens
after the baby.Why don't you trust her?

16:59.724 --> 17:01.379
Like, you're nervous
she's going to cheat on you.

17:01.379 --> 17:02.551
Cheat, yeah.

17:02.551 --> 17:04.379
She did before?Yeah.

17:04.379 --> 17:06.275
What?

17:06.275 --> 17:07.965
You didn't say
any of this.

17:09.551 --> 17:11.655
I think I just-- I came into
the house, trying to be this--

17:11.655 --> 17:14.517
Block it?
Yeah. Try to be...
Put up this front.

17:14.517 --> 17:16.000
But I see, like,
sadness in your eyes,

17:16.000 --> 17:17.862
and that breaks my heart.Ugh!

17:17.862 --> 17:21.379
I don't like bringing outside
into the house.

17:21.379 --> 17:24.896
So I try to work through it
myself, which you can't do,

17:24.896 --> 17:26.379
because everyone needs help.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.931
I was with someone that
cheated on me all the time.

17:27.931 --> 17:29.586
The feeling is horrible,
and when you want

17:29.586 --> 17:31.482
to be with that person
and they keep disrespecting you,

17:31.482 --> 17:33.310
it's one of the worst things
in the world.

17:33.310 --> 17:35.724
Especially when they're
holding your child.

17:35.724 --> 17:39.068
I didn't know that
you were feeling that.

17:39.068 --> 17:41.758
Makes total sense as to why
Ronnie's been acting

17:41.758 --> 17:44.655
the way he has, because
of what Jen did to him.

17:44.655 --> 17:46.137
We're good right now,
you know?

17:46.137 --> 17:48.413
But it's like, I don't know if
it's because she's pregnant...

17:48.413 --> 17:51.172
You're afraid that after
she's no longer pregnant...

17:51.172 --> 17:53.241
Yeah. Then she's gonna
go back to her old ways.

17:53.241 --> 17:56.724
I feel terrible how hard I've
been on Ronnie this whole time,

17:56.724 --> 17:58.724
and it's, like,
sad to know it now.

17:58.724 --> 18:00.482
Like, I feel like
it's so late.

18:00.482 --> 18:03.172
I wish I could have gave him
a hug back then, you know.

18:03.172 --> 18:06.172
I think you need to, like,
live in the moment right now

18:06.172 --> 18:08.172
until it happens,
because you're gonna

18:08.172 --> 18:09.931
drive yourself
nuts.Don't. Yeah.

18:09.931 --> 18:12.137
I've been driving
myself crazy.
I could tell.

18:12.137 --> 18:13.827
I've been driving myself nuts.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.482
You've got to truly
love your life to be happy

18:15.482 --> 18:18.000
and in a good place right now
for your daughter.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.482

she will or will not do to you.

18:21.482 --> 18:23.655
No, I know. I mean, listen.
Nobody's perfect.

18:23.655 --> 18:25.655
I did my dirt too,
so I can't just say, like,

18:25.655 --> 18:27.068
It was her, 'cause...
I know.

18:27.068 --> 18:29.172
But everything that I did
was a reaction to her action.

18:29.172 --> 18:31.344
Okay, she did what
she did, right?

18:31.344 --> 18:34.034
You chose to stay with her.
You could have left her--

18:34.034 --> 18:35.862
You're right.But you chose
to stay with her.

18:35.862 --> 18:37.827
Exactly.
And that's...So you can't keep

18:37.827 --> 18:39.517
also doing that
to her, either.

18:39.517 --> 18:42.448
I'm also not used to being
with someone like myself.

18:42.448 --> 18:44.137

I met my match.

self-sabotage mode.

18:54.344 --> 18:57.931
He gets inside his own head

like, deeper, darker place.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.827
at Sugar Factory,
and then tomorrow,

25:00.827 --> 25:03.137
it is "Operation: Proposal."

25:03.137 --> 25:04.344
I'm too old
for this .

25:04.344 --> 25:05.862
I love engagements
this time of year.

25:05.862 --> 25:08.172
Should we try and time it
for sunset?

25:08.172 --> 25:09.896
I mean, yeah, why not?

25:12.689 --> 25:14.827
Why am I sensing
some shade from Jenni?

25:14.827 --> 25:16.275
She made it sound like

25:16.275 --> 25:18.655
if it wasn't for her,
nothing would be happening.

25:18.655 --> 25:20.103
Got a lot of work
ahead of us.

25:21.551 --> 25:23.793
Yep. He's literally
not doing anything.

25:23.793 --> 25:26.275
He literally wouldn't even
write it  down.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.206
He doesn't
think things through.

25:28.206 --> 25:30.827
"Well, if it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't be doing anything."

25:30.827 --> 25:32.068
This is your moment.

25:32.068 --> 25:33.758
Don't let anyone
ruin your moment.

25:33.758 --> 25:36.275
The girls are crazy
with their marriages.

25:36.275 --> 25:38.241
"It's my day."

25:38.241 --> 25:39.586

gonna do, you know?

25:44.172 --> 25:45.586
They grow up so fast.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.689
I remember in Seaside, you had,
like, two sets of chicks

25:47.689 --> 25:49.206
all lined up
on the same night.Yep.

25:49.206 --> 25:50.793
You had to put one
on one side of the house

25:50.793 --> 25:52.344
and one on the other side
of the house.That was in Miami.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.000
That was Miami, too?
Yeah.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.310
Oh...Yep.

25:55.310 --> 25:57.965
Wait one second.

25:57.965 --> 26:00.965
In this type of situation,
man, you need to separate

26:00.965 --> 26:02.689
the two sets of girls,
and keep the other girls

26:02.689 --> 26:04.965
on the other side of the house,
and they won't know a thing.

26:04.965 --> 26:06.827
We had to diffuse
the grenades.

26:06.827 --> 26:09.103
My, how the times
have changed.Mm-hmm.

26:09.103 --> 26:13.068
The tales of The Situation
are legendary, okay?

26:13.068 --> 26:14.689
Me hanging up my player jersey

26:14.689 --> 26:16.758
and going into
the hall of fame,

26:16.758 --> 26:18.310
was only a matter of time.

26:20.689 --> 26:24.172
You look nervous.No, I'm still
a little  heated

26:24.172 --> 26:26.689

from JWowws.

26:26.689 --> 26:28.862
Now she's getting
a pie at the face.

26:28.862 --> 26:30.344
No, you're not.She's getting a pie

26:30.344 --> 26:31.758
in the face,
I'm telling you.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.620
You would never
do that to Jenni.

26:33.620 --> 26:35.034
I want to.

26:35.034 --> 26:36.379
Now that Jenni is giving me

26:36.379 --> 26:38.206
a little bit
of that stink-face,

26:38.206 --> 26:39.827
I have a little prank brewing.

26:39.827 --> 26:44.103
We're doing the,
uh, the plan right now.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.758
I feel like the old Sitch
is coming out.

26:45.758 --> 26:47.344
I feel like he's trying
to get revenge

26:47.344 --> 26:49.068
about how he doesn't like
how Jenni's, you know,

26:49.068 --> 26:51.551
throwing shade and trying
to basically say

26:51.551 --> 26:53.517
that if it wasn't for her,
he wouldn't be able

26:53.517 --> 26:55.379
to do the proposal,

26:55.379 --> 26:57.068
But if Mike tries
to prank Jenni,

26:57.068 --> 26:59.655
it's 'cause he wants to die
before he does jail time.

26:59.655 --> 27:01.344
This kid's about
to get married

27:01.344 --> 27:03.551
and all he can think about is
putting a pie in Jenni's face.

27:03.551 --> 27:04.758
I will have my revenge.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.586
He's gonna try to put
a pie in your face

27:08.586 --> 27:10.310
'cause you were,
like, going at him.

27:10.310 --> 27:12.413
Oh, my God.Oh, my God.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.034

28:39.413 --> 28:40.931
It's hard to watch him because
my situation with Jen

28:40.931 --> 28:43.793
is very conflicted and
it's driving me  crazy.

28:43.793 --> 28:45.034

that Mike has.

Yeah.

28:49.344 --> 28:52.862
Yeah. He needs, like, a hand

29:14.724 --> 29:16.172
Do not

it is so hard

29:43.551 --> 29:45.137
to keep this proposal
to myself.

29:45.137 --> 29:47.068

now that she's here.

30:01.551 --> 30:03.206
Like, I feel like we don't have
to take care of him anymore.

30:03.206 --> 30:04.724

just got here.

30:04.724 --> 30:06.206

I know, 'cause he's
gonna rat himself out.

30:09.862 --> 30:11.206
Right now he's like,
"So, babe,

this is where
I'm gonna propose to you."

33:11.310 --> 33:13.068
Wow! Look at that!

33:13.068 --> 33:15.689
It is perfect.How was your ride, Lauren?

33:15.689 --> 33:17.068
It was good.
Awesome.

33:18.344 --> 33:19.931
How was the girls' ride?

33:21.344 --> 33:23.000
Drama, like always.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.655
Can I take a picture of you guys
together for the social?

33:26.655 --> 33:29.103
Yeah.

33:29.103 --> 33:32.103
Okay, one, two, three...

33:32.103 --> 33:34.448
Tell me if you like it.
If not, delete it.

33:34.448 --> 33:37.103
I would love to put,
like, a poker face on,

33:37.103 --> 33:38.551
but I'm not
that type of person.

33:39.896 --> 33:42.103
I have a light switch,
and the switch is on.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.896
Like, literally, I have been
ignited and it's getting real.

33:45.896 --> 33:47.379
You look like Medusa.

33:47.379 --> 33:48.965
I'm about to become Medusa.

33:48.965 --> 33:50.931
I'm about to ruin
someone's proposal.

33:53.206 --> 33:54.655
Oh, God.

33:54.655 --> 33:58.758
I get why Jenni is annoyed but,
like, girl, just stop.

33:58.758 --> 34:00.241
We'll get him back
another day.

34:00.241 --> 34:03.310
But, dude, just, like,
let-- let's not do this here.

34:03.310 --> 34:05.655
Remember who's holding on
to the ring.

34:05.655 --> 34:06.965
No, we're gonna get it done.

34:06.965 --> 34:09.310
You're not being nice?Not nice.

34:09.310 --> 34:10.724
We're not gonna

34:10.724 --> 34:12.310
No, no, no.

34:12.310 --> 34:13.758
We're moms.
We're gonna get it done.

34:13.758 --> 34:15.896
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

34:15.896 --> 34:17.689
We're gonna be the moms
that we are and classy.

34:17.689 --> 34:18.931
We're gonna get it done,

34:18.931 --> 34:20.379
and then, after it,
you can attack.

34:20.379 --> 34:21.655
May I have another Patrón?

34:22.896 --> 34:25.241
You're the best.

I've, like,
never been to Vegas.
Isn't that so weird?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
No
Oh, you guys gotta come.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.482
He won't even know what
happened the day after.

34:33.482 --> 34:34.827
He'll be like,
"Oh, I'm engaged?

34:34.827 --> 34:37.896

what my trick is?

That's why, when you get
one of my wedding rings,

34:44.000 --> 34:45.482
I would never talk bad
about you, Jenni.

34:45.482 --> 34:46.689
Thanks, babe.

34:46.689 --> 34:48.241
You're being loud!You're screaming.

over my proposal at my wedding.

34:50.758 --> 34:54.413
The vibe at the table
is a little weird right now.

34:54.413 --> 34:56.482
There's like so many
conversations happening

34:56.482 --> 35:00.965
and just weird vibes coming
from Ronnie and Jenni.

35:00.965 --> 35:02.103
What's happening over there?

35:02.103 --> 35:04.000
If it was up to him,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.137

and  bubble gum.

35:06.137 --> 35:07.655

35:10.137 --> 35:11.482
I don't know
what to do right now.

35:11.482 --> 35:14.068
I'm, like, hot. I'm hot.
This is crazy.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.379
Lauren, what do you
want to drink?

35:15.379 --> 35:16.793
Do you want to come out
and have, like,

35:16.793 --> 35:18.206
a little girls' discussion?Yeah.

35:18.206 --> 35:19.551
At this point,
I think the only thing

35:19.551 --> 35:22.689
that makes sense is,
I'll take Laurens outside,

35:22.689 --> 35:25.862
I'll keep her company,
you guys squash this .

35:25.862 --> 35:27.689
Oh, it's actually
really nice outside.

35:27.689 --> 35:29.551
It is nice.
It's not as humid.

35:29.551 --> 35:32.172
