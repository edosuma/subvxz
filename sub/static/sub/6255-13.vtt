WEBVTT

00:08.151 --> 00:09.818
So, last year

00:09.854 --> 00:12.055
the First Lady
handpicked this location

00:12.089 --> 00:15.025
to kick off her Urban
Green Thumb program.

00:15.059 --> 00:17.594
And now she's handpicked you
to investigate a death on the property.

00:17.628 --> 00:20.363
No, no, no. She handpicked
the FBI and then...

00:20.398 --> 00:21.587
they picked me.

00:21.612 --> 00:23.500
So the First Lady
secondhand handpicked you.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.201
Yeah, I guess so.

00:25.236 --> 00:27.704
And I'll tell you what,
I will take that.

00:27.738 --> 00:30.306
Looks like animals
unearthed the remains.

00:30.341 --> 00:31.875
Oh, is that vomit?
Yep.

00:31.909 --> 00:33.043
I'll run a sample through

00:33.077 --> 00:34.878
the LC-MS
back at the lab, but...

00:34.912 --> 00:36.613
Okay, I'm gonna upwind.
You guys can have fun picking

00:36.647 --> 00:38.481
through the vomit.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.150
This looks to be the
pelvis and the femur bone

00:40.184 --> 00:41.918
of a common ground squirrel.

00:41.952 --> 00:45.455
Which means we're most likely
dealing with coyote vomit.

00:45.489 --> 00:47.824
Or a whole pack of them,
judging from the amount.

00:47.858 --> 00:50.960
First instar larvae of the aptly
named <i>Calliphora vomitoria</i>

00:50.995 --> 00:53.063
mean these pieces of person
have been here about two days.

00:53.097 --> 00:58.301
There appears to be
severe trauma to the rib cage.

00:58.335 --> 01:02.472
No teeth marks, so this...
isn't from the coyotes.

01:02.506 --> 01:04.708
I wonder what made them so sick.
Maybe drugs

01:04.742 --> 01:06.543
- in the victim's system?
- Probably the wheat.

01:06.577 --> 01:08.611
Rained a couple of days ago,
and when the grain gets wet,

01:08.646 --> 01:10.780
it releases a toxin
known as vomitoxin.

01:10.815 --> 01:12.082
Which, as the name implies--

01:12.116 --> 01:14.484
We get it, Dr. Hodgins.

01:14.518 --> 01:15.719
Yeah.
Based on the slightly receding

01:15.753 --> 01:18.521
zygomatic, the victim
is Caucasian.

01:18.556 --> 01:21.191
I can't tell much more until we
get the remains back to the lab.

01:21.225 --> 01:22.459
Nobody saw anything.

01:22.493 --> 01:24.461
There was no... security tapes,

01:24.495 --> 01:26.463
no one reported anything-- ah,

01:26.497 --> 01:27.764
I don't think this
is what the First Lady

01:27.798 --> 01:28.865
had in mind, you know,

01:28.899 --> 01:30.433
when she wanted everyone
to garden.

01:30.468 --> 01:32.469
Maybe someone just didn't want
to spring for a funeral.

01:32.503 --> 01:33.670
Wow. Okay. Put these little

01:33.704 --> 01:34.904
things down, continue to
look through your vomit.

01:34.939 --> 01:36.539
Bones, don't
bring those

01:36.574 --> 01:37.841
into the vehicle-- whoa!
Can you just hold this for me?

01:37.875 --> 01:39.676
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:39.710 --> 01:41.811
You don't want it?
No, no, no, no. I don't want that.

01:48.219 --> 01:50.520
Hey, Angela, They should be back
with the remains

01:50.554 --> 01:52.555
any minute.
Wendell, what happened to you?

01:52.590 --> 01:54.224
Oh, a hockey game. I got checked.
What is it with men

01:54.258 --> 01:56.826
that they're willing
to die for a ball?

01:56.861 --> 01:59.696
It's a puck.
Yeah, I mean, it's still round.

01:59.730 --> 02:01.664
You wear
your injury well, though.

02:01.699 --> 02:04.134
Ah, so you like a rugged,
damaged man.

02:04.168 --> 02:06.770
Well, yeah.
I know I shouldn't, but I do.

02:06.804 --> 02:07.926
Does Brennan know about
your arm?

02:07.951 --> 02:09.239
I'm fine.
'Cause if she didn't

02:09.240 --> 02:10.306
think you were up to speed,
then you could...

02:10.332 --> 02:11.474
I'm fine.

02:11.475 --> 02:12.609
And rugged, remember?

02:12.643 --> 02:14.083
Hey, can I sign your cast?

02:14.111 --> 02:15.578
Yeah.

02:15.613 --> 02:17.413
I can sell it for a lot
when you're famous.

02:19.116 --> 02:20.750
There's blunt force trauma
to the rib cage.

02:20.785 --> 02:23.386
The tibias and fibulas
are fractured.

02:23.420 --> 02:26.623
The grave was shallow and short.
The assailant might've

02:26.657 --> 02:28.624
broken the legs
so the victim would fit.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.772
Probably 
in a hurry.

02:29.773 --> 02:31.594
Yeah, or not strong enough
to dig a grave big enough.

02:31.595 --> 02:34.430
Between the vomit and the body,
we have most of the tissue.

02:34.465 --> 02:36.733
So the coyotes vomited the guy
back onto himself.

02:36.767 --> 02:39.736
We don't know that the victim
was male yet, Mr. Bray.

02:39.770 --> 02:42.672
Are you sure you're up to this?

02:42.706 --> 02:44.040
Aw, it's just
a little boo-boo, right?

02:44.074 --> 02:47.110
Absolutely.
Hey, Angie, nice mermaid.

02:47.144 --> 02:49.813
Uh, the rim around
the auricular surface indicates

02:49.847 --> 02:51.781
an age of late 20s, early 30s.

02:51.816 --> 02:53.983
And the heart-shaped
pelvic inlet suggests gender

02:54.018 --> 02:56.486
so...
I don't think

02:56.520 --> 02:59.289
we need bones to let us know
that the victim was a male.

02:59.323 --> 03:00.456
We have no other way,

03:00.491 --> 03:01.891
Dr. Saroyan.
I think we do.

03:01.926 --> 03:03.526
That mangled piece

03:03.561 --> 03:05.428
of meat is his...?
Yeah.

03:05.462 --> 03:07.831
Breaking my arm seems
like nothing now.

03:11.769 --> 03:12.902
Yeah.

03:12.937 --> 03:14.561
Geez!

The rib cage

The lungs have been
reduced to...

03:48.946 --> 03:50.546
a kind
of organ pudding.

03:50.581 --> 03:52.181
I don't believe this.

03:52.216 --> 03:54.917
No, it's true. I recovered
a portion of them

03:54.952 --> 03:58.165
as I was scooping vomit out
of the victim's eye socket.

03:58.166 --> 04:00.189
Bones, do you remember
that conversation we had

04:00.190 --> 04:01.824
about people trying to eat?

04:01.859 --> 04:02.892
Yes.

04:02.926 --> 04:04.360
Of course.

04:04.395 --> 04:06.696
Yes.
Well, I'm a little disappointed

04:06.730 --> 04:08.874
because what will be
our lunch conversation?

04:08.899 --> 04:09.932
I got it.

04:09.933 --> 04:13.102
You like bones; you love
broken bones, right? Okay, so...

04:13.137 --> 04:16.005
check out this video I shot of
me and Wendell playing hockey.

04:16.039 --> 04:17.173
Right...

04:17.207 --> 04:18.274
there.

04:19.243 --> 04:20.283
Boom!
Can I see that again?

04:20.310 --> 04:22.278
Yeah, sure, take it.
Look, huh?

04:22.312 --> 04:24.514
That's the exact moment
where Wendell broke his arm.

04:24.548 --> 04:25.848
That's not right.

04:25.883 --> 04:27.517
No, his was a compound fracture.

04:27.551 --> 04:28.684
It's a hockey play.
It happens all the time.

04:28.719 --> 04:29.786
It's a fair hit.

04:29.820 --> 04:31.087
Can you send that video to me?

04:31.121 --> 04:32.321
Yeah, sure.
That's a good piece

04:32.322 --> 04:34.257
I shot, right?
It's very cinematic.

04:34.291 --> 04:35.758
Yeah.

04:35.793 --> 04:37.994
This is better
conversation.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.997
I ran the victim's DNA
through CODIS and came up empty.

04:41.031 --> 04:44.300
How are things on your end?
Nothing in Missing Persons

04:44.334 --> 04:45.701
so I'm running
my facial reconstruction

04:45.736 --> 04:47.170
through the national
DMV database.

04:50.741 --> 04:53.109
Ah, and apparently,
he did not drive.

04:53.143 --> 04:55.578
Hey, so I found this bloody
napkin in the victim's pants.

04:55.612 --> 04:57.246
There's a logo printed

04:57.281 --> 04:59.849
on the napkin beneath
all the blood. Angie, I thought

04:59.883 --> 05:02.151
you might have a way to separate
the logo from the blood.

05:02.186 --> 05:04.153
Yeah, I-I do, actually.

05:04.188 --> 05:08.157
I'll snap a photo using
an 87 filter, and...

05:08.192 --> 05:10.159
that should black out
any visible light.

05:10.194 --> 05:12.762
The blood on the napkin
should radiate at one wavelength

05:12.796 --> 05:15.865
while the logo should radiate
at another.

05:18.035 --> 05:19.569
Wow.

05:19.603 --> 05:22.071
Track it to the restaurant
he ate at before he died.

05:22.105 --> 05:24.040
- Very smart.
- Okay.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.142
A little infrared.

05:28.011 --> 05:30.046
Lebemi's Bar.
I know that place.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.013
Yeah, it's in Langley Park.

05:31.048 --> 05:32.014
Same neighborhood

05:32.049 --> 05:33.683
where the body was found.

05:35.352 --> 05:38.588
Yeah. Yeah,
this could be Colin.

05:38.622 --> 05:39.722
Colin who?

05:43.060 --> 05:44.994
Colin Haynes.

05:45.028 --> 05:47.230
He a singer?
Cowboy stuff.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.898
Real authentic type.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.333
Colin in trouble?
Oh, Colin's

05:50.367 --> 05:52.034
past trouble-- he's dead.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.403
Oh, man.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.339
What happened?
Colin have a band?

05:56.373 --> 05:57.974
Or a manager?
Anything like that?

05:58.008 --> 05:59.976
No, it was j-just him
and his guitar.

06:00.010 --> 06:02.211
I'm pretty sure
he manages himself, too.

06:02.246 --> 06:04.146
Did he ever have any problems
with anybody in the audience?

06:04.181 --> 06:05.414
Any enemies?
No.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.750
No. Uh... mostly played
to his regulars.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.219
Uh, music nuts.
Uh, they loved him.

06:10.254 --> 06:11.687
All 20 of 'em.

06:11.722 --> 06:12.655
Did he make a living at it?

06:12.689 --> 06:13.923
Colin?

06:13.957 --> 06:15.391
No, no.

06:15.425 --> 06:16.559
He was always broke.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.327
He supported
his music habit

06:18.362 --> 06:20.763
by mowing lawns or
working construction.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.399
Lived in the Tea Tree Apartments
over on Naylor.

06:23.433 --> 06:24.600
Any family?

06:24.635 --> 06:26.936
Just his audience,
far as I know.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.238
Man, that's just sad.

06:29.273 --> 06:32.375
The guy never once in his life
caught a break.

06:33.944 --> 06:36.779
A musician, huh?
Booth says he wrote country songs.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.882
Colin Haynes.
Never heard of him.

06:41.151 --> 06:44.120
The right fibula
is riddled with cloacae.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.289
Osteomyelitis.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.724
Based on the amount of sequestra
on the bone,

06:48.759 --> 06:52.194
he suffered from this infection
for quite some time.

06:52.229 --> 06:54.030
"Suffered" is right. He must
have been in a lot of pain.

06:54.064 --> 06:55.531
How does your arm feel?

06:55.566 --> 06:56.766
Eh, it itches.
Have you

06:56.800 --> 06:58.734
broken bones before?
No. I must be getting old.

06:58.769 --> 07:00.770
Frankly, I didn't think
I hit the ice that hard.

07:00.804 --> 07:02.127
Neither did I.

07:02.152 --> 07:03.272
Oh, Booth showed you
the video he took?

07:03.273 --> 07:04.907
Isn't it awesome?
No.

07:04.942 --> 07:06.108
Did your doctor
say anything

07:06.143 --> 07:09.612
about it while he or she
was setting the bone?

07:09.646 --> 07:12.848
Yeah. He said, "You might feel
a little bit of pressure."

07:12.883 --> 07:16.285
Apparently, pressure feels
like a knife in the arm.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.323
Why didn't this guy get
treatment for his osteomyelitis?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.525
I don't think
he made much money.

07:24.828 --> 07:28.164
Even when he drank too much,
which he did, Colin was polite.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.967
"Courtly". I get
Word of the Day on my phone.

07:31.001 --> 07:33.302
Was he trustworthy?
He paid his rent on time,

07:33.337 --> 07:34.570
if that's what you mean.
How long

07:34.605 --> 07:36.205
did he live here?
I don't know exactly.

07:36.239 --> 07:37.340
Around ten years.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.611
I've only been the super for...
just over a year.

07:39.612 --> 07:40.710
Did you hear or see
anything suspicious

07:40.711 --> 07:43.479
around Colin's apartment
Saturday night?

07:43.513 --> 07:45.548
Nah, Colin was a pretty quiet
guy, except for his music.

07:45.582 --> 07:48.884
Kept to himself.

07:53.490 --> 07:56.692
Pull the door tight
behind you when you leave.

07:57.961 --> 07:59.362
Looks like this guy
was having a hard time.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.696
Mm-hmm.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.531
Old guitar is the
nicest thing he owns.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.666
Yeah.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.736
Lot of old stuff in here.

08:06.770 --> 08:08.504
Hmm. Check
this out, huh?

08:08.538 --> 08:10.573
Johnny Cash.

08:10.607 --> 08:13.342
Waylon Jennings.

08:13.377 --> 08:15.411
Billy Joe Shaver.

08:15.445 --> 08:17.713
Never heard of that last one.
It's old-school.Hard-core country.

08:17.748 --> 08:18.390
How do you know?

08:18.415 --> 08:19.849
What do you mean how do
I know? I was in the Army.

08:19.850 --> 08:21.290
Okay? I have... I have
a grandfather.

08:21.318 --> 08:22.752
I was basically raised
in the Grand Ole...

08:22.786 --> 08:24.654
Opry.

08:24.688 --> 08:27.790
"She shouldn't do
the things she does,

08:27.824 --> 08:30.793
"She deserves better than dirty
glasses and soggy bills,

08:30.827 --> 08:32.727
She deserves better."
Hmm. Look at this.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.697
A check torn up
for $1,000.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.899
I couldn't see him
throwing out ten bucks.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.701
"BoarHog Record
and Publishing."

08:38.735 --> 08:40.001
Got an address
and everything.

08:40.037 --> 08:42.071
Thank you very much.

08:42.748 --> 08:44.248
These are Mr. Bray's
X-rays?

08:45.180 --> 08:48.148
When did he give you the
authorization to look at them?

08:48.183 --> 08:50.818
He didn't.

08:50.852 --> 08:52.853
This is unethical,
Dr. Brennan.

08:52.887 --> 08:54.688
Mr. Bray is my charge.

08:54.723 --> 08:56.790
I have a responsibility to make
sure that he gets the best care.

08:56.825 --> 08:58.592
That is his decision
to make.

08:58.627 --> 09:01.962
His machismo caused him
to get injured

09:01.997 --> 09:03.931
and will certainly prevent him
from asking for help.

09:03.965 --> 09:05.766
He thinks he just broke his arm.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.267
Which is what the X-rays show.

09:07.302 --> 09:09.403
To someone not as
brilliant as myself,

09:09.437 --> 09:12.606
which is why I can't fault the
emergency room doctor. Or you.

09:12.641 --> 09:14.942
Me?
Yes.

09:14.976 --> 09:18.145
The impact Mr. Bray sustained
playing hockey shouldn't have

09:18.179 --> 09:21.348
caused a compound fracture
to his radius. Look.

09:21.383 --> 09:24.318
You see the microscopic spots

09:24.352 --> 09:25.919
just above
the fracture?

09:25.954 --> 09:28.155
Those are permeative lytic
lesions.

09:28.189 --> 09:30.524
Oh, my God.

09:30.558 --> 09:32.926
And that?
Lamellated periosteal

09:32.961 --> 09:35.696
reactions to the lesions.

09:35.730 --> 09:39.933
Mr. Bray has Ewing's sarcoma.

09:39.968 --> 09:41.168
It's very rare.

09:41.202 --> 09:44.171
Bone cancer.

09:44.205 --> 09:47.174
Bone cancer.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.709
Colin had talent.

09:48.743 --> 09:50.244
I thought he was
gonna be big--

09:50.278 --> 09:53.013
this generation's Merle Haggard
or Blake Shelton.

09:53.048 --> 09:55.949
So his music was good?
Yeah, but no one bought it.

09:55.984 --> 09:58.819
Only sold 203 units,
which, you know, is a shame

09:58.853 --> 10:00.320
'cause the kid deserved better.

10:00.355 --> 10:02.222
So you dropped him.
Tough business.

10:02.257 --> 10:05.025
Hey, look, I almost went broke
promoting the kid.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.927
But sometimes talent
isn't enough.

10:06.961 --> 10:08.562
I mean, nowadays
you've got to...

10:08.596 --> 10:11.331
stick your tongue out
or point a foam finger at your

10:11.366 --> 10:13.834
hoo-ha to get someone to even notice.
Is that why

10:13.868 --> 10:16.036
BoarHog's been struggling?
Brutal, baby,

10:16.071 --> 10:17.905
being an independent
label now.

10:17.939 --> 10:20.340
But I make do.
And I got a good ear.

10:20.375 --> 10:22.776
I will turn it around.
So, even struggling,

10:22.811 --> 10:25.779
you cut Colin a check for $1,000.
Yeah.

10:25.814 --> 10:27.381
Like I said, I liked him.

10:27.415 --> 10:29.416
You know, and he had
that bum leg and all,

10:29.451 --> 10:32.052
so I checked in on him
now and then.

10:32.087 --> 10:34.621
If all that's true, why did
Colin tear up your check?

10:34.656 --> 10:35.789
He tore up the check?

10:35.824 --> 10:38.025
Wow.

10:38.059 --> 10:40.127
I guess the poor kid was
more troubled than I thought.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.729
All right, you know,

10:41.763 --> 10:44.064
I've been reading about you
and your label, Harriet.

10:44.099 --> 10:46.237
Not too many of your artists
spoke kindly about you.

10:46.262 --> 10:46.900
Please.

10:46.901 --> 10:49.303
People get bitter
if they don't become stars.

10:49.337 --> 10:52.339
You know, when I started,
it was about the music.

10:52.373 --> 10:53.617
Just the music.

10:53.642 --> 10:55.309
You're saying
you've been misunderstood.

10:55.310 --> 10:56.777
Yeah, but I got
a thick skin.

10:56.811 --> 10:58.112
So, boys, anything else?

10:58.146 --> 11:00.414
I got to go hear
a 17-year-old kid play.

11:00.448 --> 11:02.282
He's gonna be
the next Bruno Mars.

11:02.317 --> 11:04.251
I will be back.

11:04.285 --> 11:05.385
You'll see.

11:05.420 --> 11:06.887
Great. Okay. You know what?

11:06.921 --> 11:09.857
I'm sure we'll talk again.
Well, I hope so.

11:09.891 --> 11:11.525
You are cute, baby.

11:11.559 --> 11:12.960
Oh.

11:17.265 --> 11:19.233
<i>Okay, I've input the CD</i>

11:19.267 --> 11:22.102
from Colin's place and the one
from BoarHog Records.

11:22.137 --> 11:24.838
So now what?
Now I need you

11:24.873 --> 11:28.142
to help create a psych profile
of Colin through his music.

11:28.176 --> 11:31.311
If we can examine the issues
and emotions in his songs,

11:31.346 --> 11:33.547
we can get an indication
of the kinds

11:33.581 --> 11:35.883
of situations
he got himself involved in.

11:35.917 --> 11:38.552
Well, lyrics can help,
but melody can often

11:38.586 --> 11:40.721
convey more emotion
than words can.

11:40.755 --> 11:43.026
I can analyze tempo
and rhythm and beat.

11:43.051 --> 11:43.857
Great.

11:43.858 --> 11:46.660
Okay, this is the CD
that Harriet's label released.

11:46.694 --> 11:48.562
♪ I won't forget
the day I found ♪

11:48.596 --> 11:52.366

The tracks have titles
like "Tomorrowland,"

12:02.076 --> 12:05.212
"When the Sun Rises"-- clearly,
Colin was focused on the future.

12:05.246 --> 12:08.015
Yeah, I mean,
he just got signed.

12:10.084 --> 12:11.718
He really was good.
Yeah.

12:11.753 --> 12:14.254
I mean, I usually
hate country, but...

12:14.289 --> 12:15.923
this is pretty great.

Okay, now...

12:29.170 --> 12:32.206
I have sampled
portions of all the tracks.

12:32.240 --> 12:36.043
94% of the songs
contain a fast tempo,

12:36.077 --> 12:40.180
and 87% held a smooth,
consistent rhythm.

12:40.215 --> 12:43.217
Well, both are associated
with happiness and optimism.

12:43.251 --> 12:45.219
Okay, now,

13:16.251 --> 13:20.420
He's playing
around in minor chords.

13:20.455 --> 13:23.690
D minor in 40% of the songs.
Mmm.

13:23.725 --> 13:27.361
My dad always said that was
the saddest key of them all.

13:27.395 --> 13:29.162
Well, yeah, he was conflicted.

13:29.197 --> 13:31.531
He was struggling
to salvage his career.

13:31.566 --> 13:33.400
And it looks like
from the titles,

13:33.434 --> 13:35.068
there's no love songs.

13:35.103 --> 13:36.904
Don't you think that's
kind of weird for a guy

13:36.905 --> 13:38.739
that's in his 20s?
Yeah. And the lyrics

13:38.773 --> 13:41.375
are lamenting his past-- there's
nothing about his future.

13:41.409 --> 13:42.576
And then there's this.

13:44.412 --> 13:45.479
All right, so these are lyrics

13:45.513 --> 13:47.114
that we found
on the typewriter.

13:47.148 --> 13:48.482
They're very personal,

13:48.516 --> 13:50.350
and they're more hopeful.

13:50.385 --> 13:52.386
Looks like a love song.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.054
You didn't find a
recording over there?

13:54.088 --> 13:57.291
Maybe he didn't make one.
Mmm.

13:58.259 --> 14:00.527
Hey, look at the paper, Sweets.

14:00.561 --> 14:02.429
Uh...

14:02.463 --> 14:04.831
Hmm.

14:10.672 --> 14:13.440
Yeah, there are strike marks
and pencil marks

14:13.474 --> 14:14.975
from another piece of paper.

14:15.009 --> 14:16.476
Other lyrics maybe?

14:16.511 --> 14:19.546
He must have been writing
a bunch of new songs.

14:19.580 --> 14:22.115
You should go back and look
through his place again.

14:25.753 --> 14:27.821
Hemorrhagic staining confirms
the trauma to the rib cage

14:27.855 --> 14:29.990
as the cause of death.
Very good, Mr. Bray.

14:30.024 --> 14:33.060
It was actually pretty obvious
now that the bones are clean.

14:33.094 --> 14:34.428
Which you also did well.

14:34.462 --> 14:36.596
Thanks?
Do you feel any...

14:36.631 --> 14:38.198
swelling around your fracture?

14:38.232 --> 14:40.434
I'm fine.
Or heat?

14:40.468 --> 14:42.903
Really, I'm fine. You really
have become a good mom.

14:42.937 --> 14:45.038
Here you go. Bone bits.

14:45.073 --> 14:46.807
Probably what your arm
looks like now.

14:46.841 --> 14:48.075
His fracture looks

14:48.109 --> 14:50.777
nothing like that, Dr. Hodgins.
No, yeah,

14:50.812 --> 14:52.379
I know. I was just making
a little joke, Dr. B.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.648
A joke implies humor, which was
missing from your comment.

14:54.682 --> 14:56.049
It's okay, Dr. Brennan.
It's just

14:56.084 --> 14:57.050
a busted arm.

14:57.085 --> 14:58.552
If there's nothing else,

14:58.586 --> 14:59.853
Dr. Hodgins.

14:59.887 --> 15:01.521
No. No.

15:01.556 --> 15:04.591
I'd better... get back to work.

15:04.625 --> 15:07.828
There appear to be
jagged fracture lines

15:07.862 --> 15:10.497
on the anterior surface of
the third sternal rib, as well

15:10.531 --> 15:11.631
as the fourth
and the fifth.

15:11.666 --> 15:13.367
The anterior aspect?

15:13.401 --> 15:16.370
That suggests the ribs
were broken outward.

15:16.404 --> 15:19.906
The killer used some kind
of tool to get under the ribs

15:19.941 --> 15:22.309
and pull something out
of the chest cavity.

15:22.343 --> 15:25.012
Are you suggesting the
killer tore open the ribs

15:25.046 --> 15:27.014
in order to remove
the victim's heart?

15:27.048 --> 15:29.549
Please see
if you can confirm this.

15:30.485 --> 15:32.085
I have to go meet Booth.

15:35.323 --> 15:39.326
Ewing's sarcoma.
It's a form of bone cancer.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.862
Cancer?

15:45.133 --> 15:48.702
It's a very
rare strain.

15:51.305 --> 15:55.075
I usually can maintain some
kind of professional reserve,

15:55.109 --> 15:59.946
a... distance, but I
was so awkward with him.

15:59.981 --> 16:03.250
Because you care.

16:03.284 --> 16:05.452
This is horrible.

16:05.486 --> 16:09.156
And you're sure,
right?

16:09.190 --> 16:12.592
Of course.

16:12.627 --> 16:14.461
Wow.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.830
He's gonna be fine, right?

16:16.864 --> 16:20.867
Ewing's sarcoma has
a very high mortality rate.

16:20.902 --> 16:22.869
Without aggressive treatment,
it could spread

16:22.904 --> 16:26.006
to the rest of
his body in months.

16:29.777 --> 16:31.645
I have to tell him, Booth.

16:31.679 --> 16:33.580
He needs to see a specialist.

16:33.614 --> 16:35.849
Yeah, yeah. For sure. I...

16:35.883 --> 16:38.752
Oh, my God...

16:42.290 --> 16:45.559
What should
I say to him?

16:45.593 --> 16:47.661
Just be honest. Just tell him.

16:47.695 --> 16:50.030
I mean, he's strong.
He can take it.

16:50.064 --> 16:52.065
You can tell him
what to do next.

16:52.100 --> 16:55.902
Well, that's up to him.

16:55.937 --> 16:58.305
No one else knows, right?

16:58.339 --> 17:00.607
For now, just us...

17:00.641 --> 17:03.110
and Cam.

17:03.144 --> 17:06.378
He's gonna beat this.
He's gonna be fine.

17:08.000 --> 17:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:16.723 --> 17:19.126
Thanks. This shouldn't take long.
Take your time.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.928
I like having guys in suits
in my building.

17:21.963 --> 17:24.030
Kind of classes the place up
a bit.

17:25.366 --> 17:26.733
Cassette tapes.

17:26.767 --> 17:28.602
Who uses cassettes anymore?

17:28.636 --> 17:30.770
Oh, he used that crappy thing
to record himself

17:30.805 --> 17:33.507
- at the bar.
- Oh. What do you got?

17:33.541 --> 17:34.875
Here.

17:34.909 --> 17:36.776
Great.

17:36.811 --> 17:39.279
You taking that?
Yeah.

17:39.313 --> 17:40.680
Anything that helps out
in the investigation.

17:40.715 --> 17:42.549
You have a problem with that?
No.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.317
I have the songs running around
in my head.

17:44.352 --> 17:46.419
He'd play all the time.
These walls are thin.

17:46.454 --> 17:47.269
You didn't like Colin?

17:47.294 --> 17:49.588
His stuff was pretty
good, I guess, but...

17:50.324 --> 17:51.925
only a loser uses
a cassette player, right?

17:51.959 --> 17:54.227
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stay with her

17:54.262 --> 17:55.362
in case he's not alone.

17:56.297 --> 17:58.064
FBI!

17:58.099 --> 18:00.433
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:10.211 --> 18:12.612
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

18:17.552 --> 18:19.719
Shoot please!

18:19.754 --> 18:22.122
Don't want to live anymore!

18:22.156 --> 18:23.857
Shoot me!

18:25.779 --> 18:27.395
Let's go. Do you want to tell me
what you were doing

18:27.396 --> 18:29.230
in Colin Haynes' apartment?

18:30.118 --> 18:32.486
I just wanted
a piece of him.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.489
Okay, a piece of him-- this is
getting creepier by the minute.

18:35.523 --> 18:38.258
For the museum. Nothing big.
A T-shirt, a hat.

18:38.292 --> 18:41.161
What museum?
The Colin Haynes Museum in Davao.

18:41.195 --> 18:43.730
In the Philippines?
Wait a second. Why did Colin Haynes

18:43.764 --> 18:45.799
have a museum in
the Philippines?

18:45.833 --> 18:47.634
Because he is a great genius.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.269
How can you not know that?

18:49.303 --> 18:50.203
Nobody knows
who he is.

18:50.238 --> 18:51.872
He live in poverty.
You saw his place.

18:51.906 --> 18:53.807
He had his reasons.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.243
Colin Haynes is genius.

18:56.277 --> 18:58.145
Look, how did you even hear
about Colin Haynes

18:58.179 --> 19:00.780
in the Philippines?
His music is everywhere.

19:00.815 --> 19:02.849
He is played on the radio.

19:02.884 --> 19:05.552
But until last week,
nobody knew where to find him.

19:05.586 --> 19:07.454
Most people thought
he was long dead.

19:07.488 --> 19:09.456
Well, he's short dead,
as it turned out.

19:09.490 --> 19:11.892
What happened a week ago?
A video appeared online.

19:11.926 --> 19:14.594
It is my mission
to keep him alive.

19:14.629 --> 19:16.930
You must believe.
Right, well, what I believe

19:16.964 --> 19:19.633
is we got you on breaking,
entering and burglary, all right?

19:19.667 --> 19:22.369
And in exchange, you know what?
You get a free bed and meals.

19:22.403 --> 19:24.571
Welcome to America.
Come on.

19:29.410 --> 19:31.011
This is Colin.

the day I found ♪

19:35.416 --> 19:37.417

What language is this Web site?

19:42.490 --> 19:44.191
Tagalog, which is why

19:44.225 --> 19:47.494
it didn't pop up in my
earlier Internet search.

19:47.528 --> 19:50.630
And what is that?
That's that video

19:50.665 --> 19:55.035
that the fan saw last week that
proved Colin was still alive.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.970
Can I help you with something?

19:57.004 --> 19:58.405
You're Colin Haynes.

19:58.439 --> 19:59.739
Yeah, I am.

19:59.774 --> 20:01.041
Unless you're a creditor.

20:01.075 --> 20:04.044
No, sir. Just a big fan.

20:04.078 --> 20:05.078
Wow, this is amazing.

20:05.112 --> 20:06.379
A fan?

20:06.414 --> 20:07.948
Where-where'd you hear me play?

20:07.982 --> 20:09.749
Duke's? Lebemi's?

20:09.784 --> 20:11.484
The radio.

20:11.519 --> 20:14.387
No. I never got much radio play.

20:14.422 --> 20:17.057
It's been all over
Filipino radio for years.

20:17.091 --> 20:19.626
My music's being played
in the Philippines?

20:19.660 --> 20:21.561
Huh. Seems like Colin
had no idea

20:21.596 --> 20:22.829
how popular he was over there.

20:22.863 --> 20:24.364
Whoever uploaded
this video

20:24.398 --> 20:27.567
also geo-tagged it, giving away
the exact location

20:27.602 --> 20:29.603
of where this
interaction took place.

20:29.637 --> 20:31.137
Which would explain
how that

20:31.172 --> 20:33.640
other crazy fan knew where
to find Colin.

20:33.674 --> 20:36.710
Yeah, or anyone else who
wanted to murder him.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.647
Hey.

20:40.681 --> 20:42.515
Whoa, Booth,
you didn't tell me

20:42.550 --> 20:45.585
that Dr. Brennan would be
joining us-- that's a first.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.153
Booth didn't want
to worry you.

20:47.188 --> 20:49.055
Uh-oh.

20:49.090 --> 20:52.926
Is this about my arm? 'Cause
I can work just as hard as ever.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.894
It is about your arm.

20:54.929 --> 20:57.430
Mr. Bray...

20:57.465 --> 20:59.466
Wendell,

20:59.500 --> 21:01.801
I...

21:01.836 --> 21:04.137
I looked at your X-rays.

21:06.474 --> 21:10.110
Perhaps I should... show him.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.379
I think you should just tell him
and then he can decide

21:12.413 --> 21:15.081
whether or not he wants to look
at them later, okay?

21:15.116 --> 21:18.285
Tell me what?

21:20.388 --> 21:22.322
I find I'm more emotional...

21:22.356 --> 21:24.190
than I anticipated
on the subject.

21:24.225 --> 21:26.960
Listen,
Bones looked

21:26.994 --> 21:28.328
at your X-rays.

21:28.362 --> 21:31.431
Yeah, I-I got that part.

21:31.465 --> 21:35.468
She thinks that you might have
cancer in your bone.

21:39.307 --> 21:42.609
I suspect Ewing's sarcoma.

21:42.643 --> 21:45.779
Ewing's sarcoma?

21:45.813 --> 21:48.148
Of course,
you'll need a more

21:48.182 --> 21:52.052
detailed diagnosis
from an oncologist.

21:54.155 --> 21:57.424
Bones got a... a top guy
for you to go see,

21:57.458 --> 21:59.426
all right?
He's the best

21:59.460 --> 22:02.595
- in his field.
Mm-hmm.

22:02.630 --> 22:05.965
Ewing's sarcoma--
that's one of the...

22:06.000 --> 22:07.667
bad ones.

22:07.702 --> 22:10.070
There's, uh...

22:10.104 --> 22:14.174
less than a ten percent chance
of long-term survival.

22:14.208 --> 22:16.743
That's correct.

22:16.777 --> 22:19.713
Okay, look,
make the appointment

22:19.747 --> 22:21.948
to go see the expert,
okay, Wendell?

22:21.982 --> 22:24.517
That's the first step.

22:39.467 --> 22:41.568
Thank you.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.608
You want to get some lunch?

22:48.642 --> 22:50.844
No, I'm good. Thanks.

22:53.814 --> 22:56.116
I just need a little, uh, time.

22:56.150 --> 22:58.284
We understand.

23:12.633 --> 23:14.901
I checked the manifest
against his boarding pass,

23:14.935 --> 23:16.936
and Adrian's alibi
holds up.

23:16.971 --> 23:18.705
His flight from Manila

23:18.739 --> 23:20.507
didn't get to DC
until Sunday morning.

23:20.541 --> 23:22.342
And since Colin was killed
Saturday night,

23:22.376 --> 23:24.110
it means Adrian
isn't our guy, right?

23:24.145 --> 23:25.311
Back to square one.

23:25.346 --> 23:26.813
Actually, no.

23:26.847 --> 23:29.215
The woman in the video
said that Colin's music

23:29.250 --> 23:30.907
was all over the radio
in the Philippines.

23:31.559 --> 23:32.685
Yeah?

23:32.686 --> 23:35.288
And didn't Adrian say that you
could get his album over there?

23:35.322 --> 23:37.223
Yeah, but from the way
he was living,

23:37.258 --> 23:39.025
he wasn't getting royalties.

23:39.059 --> 23:41.161
Unless that check
from BoarHog Records...

23:41.195 --> 23:44.230
A thousand bucks for both
publishing <i>and</i> performance?

23:44.265 --> 23:47.667
Harriet wasn't giving him
nearly what he was due.

23:47.701 --> 23:50.703
I can account
for a lot of cardiac muscle--

23:50.738 --> 23:53.973
not all of it, but...
So the killer never took the heart?

23:54.008 --> 23:56.075
No. The coyotes
did that after death.

23:56.110 --> 23:58.611
What is going on here?
Oh, it's the victim's shirt.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.947
I'm trying to find the hole
that was created

24:00.981 --> 24:02.849
by the murder weapon--
no luck yet.

24:02.883 --> 24:05.752
<i>But</i> what I did find was...

24:05.786 --> 24:08.154
traces of egg,

24:08.189 --> 24:10.323
rodent, squirrel,
lemon juice

24:10.357 --> 24:13.326
and sugars, esters and ketones
consistent with liquor.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.994
Lemon juice, liquor and eggs.

24:15.029 --> 24:16.796
Some kind of drink?

24:16.831 --> 24:18.264
See if you
can find out

24:18.299 --> 24:20.300
the liquor and match
the ingredients to a cocktail.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.702
Yep.

24:22.736 --> 24:24.771
So, you're familiar with ASCAP?

24:24.805 --> 24:26.706
Yeah. Why?

24:26.740 --> 24:28.842
Right.
So, they track radio play

24:28.876 --> 24:30.677
and publishing, correct?
That's right.

24:30.711 --> 24:32.779
Well, ASCAP says that

24:32.813 --> 24:34.347
the publishing arm
of BoarHog receive

24:34.381 --> 24:35.748
over $100,000

24:35.783 --> 24:38.418
in foreign royalties
for Colin's music.

24:38.452 --> 24:40.954
I'd have to check
with my accountants about that,

24:40.988 --> 24:42.989
but let's...

24:43.023 --> 24:46.059
No, this... this
doesn't look right to me.

24:46.093 --> 24:50.029
Like I said, Colin only sold
a couple of hundred units.

24:50.064 --> 24:52.732
Not counting the Philippines,
right, Harriet?

24:52.766 --> 24:54.667
The Philippines?
You know what, Harriet?

24:54.702 --> 24:57.203
You do the whole innocent
thing really well.

24:57.238 --> 25:00.840
You see, the bigger issue is,
the songs that Colin wrote,

25:00.875 --> 25:03.042
they were registered
under your name.

25:03.077 --> 25:05.178
Well, that's not unheard of
in the music business.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.813
Of all the money
that Colin made

25:06.847 --> 25:09.182
for you, you cut him a check
for a thousand dollars.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.517
No, that was charity.

25:10.551 --> 25:13.019
I did that out
of the goodness of my heart,

25:13.053 --> 25:16.322
to help fix his bad leg.
in 1994, you hired two bouncers

25:16.357 --> 25:18.324
to break the fingers
of a musician

25:18.359 --> 25:20.426
who decided to,
uh, switch labels.

25:20.461 --> 25:21.861
The '90s were tough

25:21.896 --> 25:23.396
in the music business.

25:23.430 --> 25:24.831
I did my time.

25:24.865 --> 25:27.367
Hey, I am a grandma now.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.536
Right. I think you did
the same thing to Colin Haynes

25:29.570 --> 25:32.939
when he came around looking
for his money that you stole.

25:38.196 --> 25:40.564
I'm, uh, seeing
Dr. Sidikaro this afternoon.

25:40.598 --> 25:42.599
Thanks for making
that happen.

25:42.634 --> 25:45.035
If you'd like to leave now...
Actually, I don't really know

25:45.069 --> 25:47.504
what I'd like, so I
may as well stay here

25:47.539 --> 25:48.739
until my appointment.

25:48.773 --> 25:51.041
Uh, ribs two
through five

25:51.075 --> 25:53.443
show fracturing consistent
with the outward trauma.

25:53.478 --> 25:54.778
But the heavy
splintering

25:54.812 --> 25:59.183
of the bone on the posterior
aspect indicates

25:59.217 --> 26:01.618
<i>inward</i> trauma.
Mm.

26:01.653 --> 26:05.589
I assume you've done research
on your condition.

26:05.623 --> 26:07.791
Yes, uh, four cycles
of alternating chemo

26:07.825 --> 26:09.459
every two weeks to start.

26:09.494 --> 26:12.663
The combination of both
inward and outward trauma

26:12.697 --> 26:15.899
suggests a fulcrum.
So one end of the murder weapon

26:15.934 --> 26:18.135
pushed the lower ribs
into the body

26:18.169 --> 26:22.973
while the other end
forced the upper ribs out.

26:23.007 --> 26:25.876
Probably radiation as well.

26:25.910 --> 26:28.145
I know.

26:28.179 --> 26:32.983
It appears a shovel
was dug into the rib cage,

26:33.017 --> 26:36.720
possibly while the grave
was being dug.

26:38.389 --> 26:41.959
The incision on the third rib
is too narrow for a shovel.

26:41.993 --> 26:44.895
It's more consistent
with the blade of a knife.

26:44.929 --> 26:46.663
The splintering
suggests

26:46.698 --> 26:49.900
that the blade was being
moved around in the bone.

26:49.934 --> 26:52.502
Excellent observation, Mr. Bray.

26:55.340 --> 26:58.542
We were becoming a good team,
weren't we?

27:00.878 --> 27:02.779
We <i>are.</i>

27:02.814 --> 27:05.415
We <i>are</i> a good team, Mr. Bray.

27:09.153 --> 27:11.188
Actually, I, uh...

27:11.222 --> 27:14.691
I will leave now so that
I'm not late for my appointment.

27:20.131 --> 27:21.999
The evidence Mr. Bray
discovered suggests

27:22.033 --> 27:24.901
that Colin was stabbed
in the heart.

27:24.936 --> 27:28.605
The blade became stuck
in the third rib.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.741
When the killer
tried to pull it out,

27:30.775 --> 27:32.409
the blade must have broken off.

27:32.443 --> 27:34.444
Oh, so the killer knocked Colin out
with the shovel

27:34.479 --> 27:36.146
so he wouldn't struggle,

27:36.180 --> 27:38.015
and then used
to dig into his rib cage

27:38.049 --> 27:40.150
and retrieve the blade.

27:41.886 --> 27:44.154
I want you all to know that

27:44.188 --> 27:45.856
Mr. Bray's work
was invaluable.

27:45.890 --> 27:47.057
See?

27:47.091 --> 27:49.760
A broken arm is nothing.

27:56.301 --> 27:58.568
Wendell. Hey.

27:58.603 --> 27:59.416
Hey. This a bad time?

27:59.441 --> 28:01.411
No. No, no. Come on in,
come on in. Hey.

28:02.407 --> 28:04.441
Can I get you anything? I mean,
not that I have anything.

28:04.475 --> 28:06.276
I'll tell you what,
we can go raid the kitchen

28:06.277 --> 28:08.378
for some stale donuts.
Nah, I'm fine, Booth.

28:08.413 --> 28:10.380
I don't need anything.

28:10.415 --> 28:12.983
Okay.

28:14.485 --> 28:17.421
I just came
from the doctor.

28:17.455 --> 28:18.922
Well, not, uh, just.

28:18.956 --> 28:21.858
I've been walking around
for a while...

28:21.893 --> 28:23.927
Right, I get it.

28:23.961 --> 28:28.298
Then I headed back to work,
and I thought, uh...

28:30.468 --> 28:33.036
...what am I doing?

28:33.071 --> 28:35.706
Well, what did the doctor say?

28:37.241 --> 28:38.542
Well, there's chemo.

28:38.576 --> 28:40.210
You know, I knew that.

28:40.244 --> 28:41.878
Then there's, uh, surgery

28:41.913 --> 28:44.247
to remove the radius, replace it
with an artificial one,

28:44.282 --> 28:46.516
if they... uh,

28:46.551 --> 28:48.218
don't have to amputate.

28:48.252 --> 28:49.553
Then there's,

28:49.587 --> 28:50.854
uh, radiation,

28:50.888 --> 28:53.890
and another...
13 cycles of chemo.

28:55.793 --> 28:58.095
Even then
there's no guarantees.

28:58.129 --> 29:00.009
Well, look, there's
never any guarantees, right?

29:00.031 --> 29:02.265
So... so, when do you start?

29:02.300 --> 29:06.036
He wants me to start on Tuesday.
Right.

29:06.070 --> 29:08.405
Tuesday. Okay.

29:08.439 --> 29:11.408
I'm wondering if it's worth it.

29:11.442 --> 29:12.642
What?

29:12.677 --> 29:14.111
The mortality rate
is still high.

29:14.145 --> 29:17.647
I could...
I could just ride it out.

29:17.682 --> 29:19.583
M-Maybe it's my time.
No, no,

29:19.617 --> 29:22.619
it's not your time, it's...
not even close to your time.

29:22.653 --> 29:23.887
No, I saw my dad

29:23.921 --> 29:25.389
go through it.

29:25.423 --> 29:27.424
Sick from the chemo
until the end,

29:27.458 --> 29:30.026
and he missed out on living.

29:34.899 --> 29:37.067
I'm okay with it.

29:37.101 --> 29:39.202
I could just... take off.

29:39.237 --> 29:40.971
I've always wanted
to see South America,

29:41.005 --> 29:42.606
the Galapagos, you know,
the Adriatic.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.541
I'd just kick back, drink, sleep
with as many women as I can.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.877
No, no, you're not
gonna do that, okay?

29:46.911 --> 29:48.812
You're gonna get the treatment,
you're gonna throw up,

29:48.846 --> 29:50.981
and you're gonna feel miserable,
but none of that's gonna matter

29:51.015 --> 29:53.650
because you're gonna live
to be a hundred.

29:55.119 --> 29:58.054
You should be my doctor.
Come on, I'm serious.

29:58.089 --> 29:59.756
You can fight this.

29:59.791 --> 30:01.324
You have to fight this.

30:01.359 --> 30:04.494
Why?
Why? Because there's a life out there

30:04.529 --> 30:06.263
that you haven't even lived yet.

30:06.297 --> 30:08.231
There's a woman waiting
to be your wife.

30:08.266 --> 30:10.567
Okay, a-and there's kids
waiting to be born,

30:10.601 --> 30:14.438
waiting to find out how great
of a dad you're gonna be.

30:17.141 --> 30:18.708
Plus, you have
your friends, okay?

30:18.743 --> 30:20.544
Your friends, they need you.

30:20.578 --> 30:23.246
That's why.

30:27.452 --> 30:28.953
Don't worry about that.

30:28.954 --> 30:30.386
Get it. You're working.
We'll talk later, man.

30:30.411 --> 30:31.621
Just hold on.

30:31.622 --> 30:33.423
Don't-don't move.

30:33.458 --> 30:34.758
Booth.

30:34.792 --> 30:36.059
Hey, Booth?

30:36.093 --> 30:38.013
Hey, listen, Sweets, can this wait?
You-you work.

30:38.029 --> 30:39.830
I'm going. We'll talk later, man.
No, no, no.

30:39.864 --> 30:40.831
Just hold...

30:41.966 --> 30:42.966
You okay?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.301
Yeah.

30:44.335 --> 30:46.603
What is it, Sweets?

30:46.637 --> 30:48.538
So, these are all
the lyrics I've found.

30:48.573 --> 30:49.806
Some were in the trash,

30:49.841 --> 30:51.675
some were hidden in a box
in the closet.

30:51.709 --> 30:53.844
Why?
Lack of confidence, maybe?

30:53.878 --> 30:55.278
All he wrote before
were anthems.

30:55.313 --> 30:56.546
These are all love songs.

30:56.581 --> 30:58.315
Okay, why would he
be embarrassed

30:58.349 --> 31:00.717
about something like that?
'Cause I believe

31:00.751 --> 31:03.086
for the first time in his life,
Colin was in love.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.589
And he-he was nervous
about declaring that.

31:05.623 --> 31:07.591
The songs don't
mention a name?

31:07.625 --> 31:08.994
Like "My Sharona" or
something like that?

31:09.019 --> 31:10.927
No. But Kara,

31:10.928 --> 31:13.763
the landlady, said that a lot
of girls came through here--

31:13.798 --> 31:17.267
one-night stands-- until
a few months ago; then nobody.

31:17.301 --> 31:19.703
So what you're is that being
in love got him killed.

31:19.737 --> 31:22.172
Wouldn't be the first time.

31:22.206 --> 31:24.341
Hm.

31:27.845 --> 31:30.714
Would you give up?

31:30.748 --> 31:32.482
No.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.818
While I accept its limitations,

31:34.852 --> 31:37.754
I have great faith
in medical science.

31:37.788 --> 31:40.223
Wendell's just talking
about taking off,

31:40.258 --> 31:42.259
traveling, sleeping around.

31:42.293 --> 31:45.028
It sounds quite nice.

31:45.062 --> 31:47.163
But I'd need my work.

31:47.198 --> 31:51.167
That's what will
live on when I'm gone.

31:51.202 --> 31:53.436
And my family, of course.

31:53.471 --> 31:55.038
It's not fair.

31:55.072 --> 31:58.241
Wendell's a good kid.

32:00.111 --> 32:02.245
I thought your belief in God
gave you the sense

32:02.280 --> 32:05.415
that the universe had
some kind of loving plan.

32:05.449 --> 32:07.450
Well, God tests us
to see what we're made of,

32:07.485 --> 32:09.986
so we can appreciate
what we have.

32:10.021 --> 32:12.956
Well, I can appreciate
the universe...

32:12.990 --> 32:14.925
without cancer.

32:17.161 --> 32:19.095
I'm gonna have to call in
another intern

32:19.130 --> 32:20.730
if he doesn't
show up tomorrow.

32:24.602 --> 32:26.369
Booth.

32:29.206 --> 32:30.473
Yeah.

32:30.508 --> 32:32.509
Waitress
at a Peruvian restaurant

32:32.543 --> 32:35.512
said that she saw Colin Saturday night--
he was with a woman

32:35.546 --> 32:37.380
matching the description
of his super.

32:37.415 --> 32:39.316
Kara?
Yeah.

32:39.350 --> 32:40.650
Great. Yeah, yeah.
Okay, got it.

32:40.685 --> 32:42.452
So Kara threw a drink
in his face

32:42.486 --> 32:43.853
and told him to drop dead.

32:43.888 --> 32:46.156
The same drink Hodgins
found on his clothes.

32:46.190 --> 32:49.392
Kara said that she didn't see
Colin the night that he died.

32:49.427 --> 32:52.862
Well, if I was the killer,
I would say the same thing.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.479
This room looks like the

32:55.504 --> 32:57.192
place they bring people
they think are guilty.

32:57.193 --> 32:59.461
Right. Why didn't you say that you
were on a date with Colin Haynes

32:59.495 --> 33:02.101
on the night that
he, uh, was murdered?

33:02.751 --> 33:04.101
I go on lots of dates.

33:04.102 --> 33:05.369
You threw a drink in his face.

33:05.403 --> 33:06.937
How often does that happen?

33:06.971 --> 33:09.206
It happens.
It does with you,

33:09.240 --> 33:10.641
'cause you have a past.

33:10.675 --> 33:12.476
Assault with a deadly weapon.

33:12.510 --> 33:15.746
My ex-boyfriend attacked me
with a baseball bat.

33:15.780 --> 33:19.483
I tried to get away in my car,
and ran over his foot.

33:19.517 --> 33:21.485
Now you see why I
don't talk to cops.

33:21.519 --> 33:23.551
Did Colin Haynes attack you
with a baseball bat?

33:23.576 --> 33:24.354
Look, unlike my ex,

33:24.355 --> 33:26.156
Colin seemed like
a very sweet guy.

33:26.190 --> 33:27.958
I lived next-door to him
for a year

33:27.992 --> 33:30.394
before he built up
the courage to ask me out.

33:30.428 --> 33:31.328
Was this your first date?

33:31.362 --> 33:32.429
Yeah, which I thought

33:32.463 --> 33:33.764
was going really well, too,

33:33.798 --> 33:35.832
until a couple drinks in
he starts bragging

33:35.867 --> 33:37.501
about how he's a big star.

33:37.535 --> 33:39.536
So what, that made you mad
because he told you

33:39.571 --> 33:42.806
he was a big star?
The lie made me mad. I-I got excited,

33:42.840 --> 33:45.342
because I finally
found a decent guy...

33:45.376 --> 33:47.210
and then he started
trying to impress me,

33:47.245 --> 33:49.713
like every other guy who
wants to get into my pants.

33:49.747 --> 33:52.416
So you threw the Pisco Sour
in his face.

33:52.450 --> 33:54.151
I told him to stop.

33:54.185 --> 33:57.354
But then he starts in on how
he has two tickets to paradise,

33:57.388 --> 34:00.157
and he's headlining a festival
and he wants me to go with him.

34:00.191 --> 34:01.758
So I say, "Where's the tickets?"

34:01.793 --> 34:05.495
And he says, "The overnight
delivery guy lost 'em."

34:05.530 --> 34:07.798
Come on.

34:09.333 --> 34:11.435
I overreacted...

34:11.469 --> 34:13.937
and I tossed the drink.

34:13.972 --> 34:16.706
Then what happened?
I told him to drop dead...

34:16.741 --> 34:19.342
and that's the last time
I saw him.

34:19.377 --> 34:21.812
I swear.

34:27.051 --> 34:28.952
Morning, Dr. Brennan.

34:28.987 --> 34:31.088
Good morning,
Mr. Bray. Wh...

34:31.121 --> 34:33.290
Why aren't you
in your lab coat?

34:33.324 --> 34:36.293
I, uh, just... came by
to say that I'm going.

34:36.327 --> 34:38.562
Going where?
I don't know yet.

34:38.596 --> 34:42.466
All I know is that I may not
have a lot of time left, and...

34:42.500 --> 34:44.868
I've got to spend it wisely.

34:44.902 --> 34:48.572
Did you see the oncologist?
Yes, yes. You were right--

34:48.606 --> 34:50.940
even with aggressive treatment,
I-I don't like my odds.

34:50.975 --> 34:52.943
I don't like your
odds, either.

34:52.976 --> 34:56.013
I don't like them one bit.

34:56.047 --> 34:59.616
I should see the world
while I can.

34:59.651 --> 35:01.585
Booth disagrees.

35:01.619 --> 35:02.953
I know.

35:02.987 --> 35:07.524
The world is
a wonderful place to see.

35:07.558 --> 35:10.193
So I've heard.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.668
Look, wh-what is that?

35:18.569 --> 35:19.870
What?

35:19.904 --> 35:22.039
Three parallel abrasions.

35:22.073 --> 35:24.107
You should
have seen that.

35:24.142 --> 35:26.410
I am clearly too much
of a distraction.

35:26.444 --> 35:27.678
These appear
to be inconsistent

35:27.712 --> 35:30.213
with the damage
caused by both the...

35:30.248 --> 35:31.748
shovel <i>and</i> the blade.

35:31.783 --> 35:35.719
Excellent work
yet again, Mr. Bray.

35:36.821 --> 35:38.989
Thanks.

35:41.225 --> 35:44.795
You should call one of the other
interns to help you.

36:01.679 --> 36:03.947
The victim <i>didn't</i> lie
about the plane tickets

36:03.981 --> 36:06.783
to the Philippines?
According to the tracking system,

36:06.818 --> 36:09.853
an envelope from the Philippines
was delivered to the super

36:09.887 --> 36:11.738
at his building 
the day before his murder.

36:11.763 --> 36:12.689
Colin told

36:12.690 --> 36:14.157
Kara O'Malley that
the tickets were lost.

36:14.192 --> 36:15.659
That's why she poured
the Pisco Sour all over him.

36:15.693 --> 36:18.495
She is the superintendent
of his building.

36:18.529 --> 36:20.731
Oh, my God.
So she did kill him.

36:20.765 --> 36:22.165
I don't think so.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.768
I called up
the overnight delivery guy,

36:24.802 --> 36:28.004
told him I work for the FBI--
white lie-- asked him

36:28.039 --> 36:31.908
to describe the person
who signed for the tickets.

36:31.943 --> 36:34.244
The bartender.

36:34.278 --> 36:37.380
he answered her door
in his boxers.

36:38.983 --> 36:41.251
Yeah, me and Kara
have a thing.

36:41.285 --> 36:43.553
On again, off again,
you know.

36:43.588 --> 36:45.388
Yeah, I know.
So what?

36:45.423 --> 36:47.557
The shovel's clean, Booth.

36:47.592 --> 36:50.273
'Cause it's brand-new, which means
he knew it was the murder weapon.

36:50.294 --> 36:52.763
This is all crap;
you're fishing.

36:52.797 --> 36:54.698
Fishing takes patience.
Okay, let me ask you a question:

36:54.732 --> 36:56.366
Why'd you steal the plane tickets?
Plane tickets?

36:56.400 --> 36:59.069
Mm-hmm.
I don't know what you're talking about.

36:59.103 --> 37:01.304
The overnight delivery guy
already I.D.'d you

37:01.339 --> 37:04.074
as the guy who signed
for those tickets.

37:05.176 --> 37:07.711
Well, he made a mistake.

37:07.745 --> 37:10.080
- Done.
- No, no.

37:10.114 --> 37:11.615
You're not done.

37:11.649 --> 37:13.683
You're not done
until I tell you we're done.

37:13.718 --> 37:16.086
You didn't
want Colin going

37:16.120 --> 37:17.988
to the Philippines with Kara--
that's why you stole

37:18.022 --> 37:19.823
those tickets.
You thought she was your girl.

37:19.857 --> 37:21.658
Huh? Didn't you?
Stealing some tickets.

37:21.692 --> 37:24.995
That's not murder, though, is it?
Booth.

37:25.029 --> 37:26.963
His watch-- the stems

37:26.998 --> 37:28.899
on the side, that's
what scratched the bone

37:28.933 --> 37:31.334
- and created the parallel lines we found.
- Come on,

37:31.369 --> 37:33.203
give it up.
It's a gift from my grandfather.

37:33.237 --> 37:34.571
You're not going
anywhere near it.

37:34.605 --> 37:35.972
Search warrant says
different, all right?

37:36.007 --> 37:38.942
Take it off, or I'll
rip it off your wrist.

37:45.783 --> 37:47.951
Well, blood in the beveling.

37:47.985 --> 37:51.121
You took that man's life!
Just when he had

37:51.155 --> 37:52.556
everything to live for!

37:52.590 --> 37:54.825
What? I'm supposed
to just give up my girl

37:54.859 --> 37:56.550
because Haynes writes her
some stupid song?

37:56.575 --> 37:57.905
No, you're supposed
to give her up because

37:57.906 --> 38:00.131
she deserves someone better
than you. Let's go.

38:09.841 --> 38:12.142
Colin was a big star?

38:12.176 --> 38:13.677
Yeah.

38:13.711 --> 38:15.445
In the Philippines?

38:15.479 --> 38:17.447
Yeah. He only just
found out about it.

38:17.481 --> 38:19.516
It's probably what
gave him the courage

38:19.550 --> 38:21.618
to ask you on a date.

38:22.553 --> 38:24.654
If he was such
a big star,

38:24.689 --> 38:26.690
he could have asked
anybody out.

38:26.724 --> 38:29.659
That's right.

38:31.495 --> 38:34.965
So he was telling me the truth,

38:34.999 --> 38:38.235
and I threw a drink
in his face.

38:41.539 --> 38:43.673
I feel bad.

38:44.842 --> 38:47.711
At the time he was murdered,

38:47.745 --> 38:50.747
he was writing a song for you.

38:56.888 --> 39:00.023
Why couldn't I just trust...

39:02.059 --> 39:06.563
...that he was as good
as he seemed to be, huh?

39:07.965 --> 39:11.501
These are all of his songs.

39:11.535 --> 39:14.571
The last one's
about you.

39:14.605 --> 39:16.973
Are you telling me this
to make me cry?

39:17.008 --> 39:19.709
'Cause I-I don't cry.

39:19.744 --> 39:21.912
I don't do that.

39:21.946 --> 39:26.016
No, I'm telling you this because
somebody has to mourn him.

39:26.050 --> 39:30.086
You know, someone who's
more than just a fan.

39:30.121 --> 39:33.089
Someone that'll miss him.

39:33.124 --> 39:34.758

40:46.230 --> 40:48.431
This isn't really
good to dance to.

40:48.466 --> 40:50.867
Well, when a song
isn't good for dancing,

40:50.901 --> 40:53.503
you know, the solution
is just to dance slower.

40:53.537 --> 40:55.739
That doesn't sound true.
Yeah, right, well,

40:55.773 --> 40:58.942
sometimes you just have to dance
to the music that's given to you, hmm?

40:58.976 --> 41:00.977
Trust me
on this one, all right?

41:02.213 --> 41:04.047
Ah, you get a reprieve, okay?

41:04.081 --> 41:05.215
But it's temporary.

41:05.249 --> 41:07.550
Mr. Bray.

41:07.585 --> 41:09.652
Come in.

41:09.687 --> 41:12.563
I was, uh... I'm sorry
to come to your house.

41:12.588 --> 41:13.456
No, no, come on in.

41:13.457 --> 41:15.325
Do you want a
beer or anything?

41:15.359 --> 41:17.327
No. No, no, no.
I was, um...

41:17.361 --> 41:19.162
I was leaving,
and I came here

41:19.196 --> 41:21.264
to say good-bye, but, uh...

41:22.733 --> 41:25.368
...I decided to fight.

41:27.238 --> 41:28.972
I'm not going down.

41:29.006 --> 41:33.176
Maybe I want to be remembered
in the right way.

41:33.210 --> 41:36.146
By the people
that I care about.

41:36.180 --> 41:39.682
Maybe I want to be remembered
as someone who fought back.

41:39.717 --> 41:42.852
- That's good. That's really good.
- Now, will you

41:42.887 --> 41:45.121
stay and have a drink with us?
No, no.

41:45.156 --> 41:47.490
I might need that sort of thing
later-- I don't want to...

41:47.525 --> 41:50.727
use up my share.
Right, right.

41:52.830 --> 41:53.863
We will help you

41:53.898 --> 41:56.199
in any way that we can.

41:56.233 --> 41:58.435
Thanks.

41:58.469 --> 42:00.103
Good night.

42:00.137 --> 42:01.871
Drive safe.

42:01.906 --> 42:03.373
Really?

42:03.407 --> 42:05.675
Right.

42:09.013 --> 42:13.216
So... what do you want to do,
do you want to call it a night?

42:15.252 --> 42:17.554
I don't know what I want.

42:22.393 --> 42:25.061
