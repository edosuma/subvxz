00:37.746 --> 00:40.330
There's a legend around here:

00:40.498 --> 00:44.376
<i>A killer buried but not dead.</i>

00:46.337 --> 00:49.256
<i>A curse on Crystal Lake.</i>

00:49.424 --> 00:51.383
<i>A death curse.</i>

00:52.427 --> 00:55.679
<i>Jason Voorhees' curse.</i>

01:02.312 --> 01:05.188
<i>They say he died as a boy...</i>

01:05.355 --> 01:07.983
<i>...but he keeps coming back.</i>

01:12.363 --> 01:16.408
<i>Few have seen him and lived.</i>

01:20.371 --> 01:23.290
<i>Some have even tried to stop him.</i>

01:24.042 --> 01:26.668
<i>No one can.</i>

01:51.194 --> 01:52.569
Jason's alive.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.827
He's even more powerful now.

02:08.127 --> 02:11.672
Jason belongs in hell
and I'm gonna see he gets there.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.257
Jason, come on!

02:13.424 --> 02:17.928
Come and get me!
It's me you want, remember?

03:09.022 --> 03:13.984
<i>He is down there, waiting.</i>

05:21.154 --> 05:22.571
- Don't give me that.
- Please.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.198
- I'm gonna sell this place and get out.
- Tina?

05:25.366 --> 05:27.784
- Hey, leave her out of this.
- Tina, come inside.

05:27.952 --> 05:31.163
- Yeah, come on, join the party.
- Please, don't drink any more.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.873
Don't tell me what to do!

05:40.048 --> 05:41.340
Tina?

05:43.801 --> 05:46.261
Tina, come inside, honey.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.972
Tina!

05:54.729 --> 05:56.772
Wait! Tina!

06:06.699 --> 06:09.826
Tina, don't.
Please, honey, come back.

06:09.994 --> 06:14.581
- You hit Mom again.
- Tina! Tina!

06:14.749 --> 06:17.209
I hate you! Go away!

06:17.377 --> 06:20.003
Please, baby, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

06:20.171 --> 06:24.549
Go away. I hate you!
I wish you were dead!

06:37.688 --> 06:39.731
Oh, my God!

06:49.200 --> 06:50.617
No!

06:51.369 --> 06:53.453
No, Daddy. No!

07:00.920 --> 07:03.130
John!

07:13.641 --> 07:16.309
Daddy!

07:18.062 --> 07:20.772
Tina, honey, are you all right?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.941
I'm fine.

07:26.195 --> 07:29.406
I don't think this is such a good idea.

07:29.574 --> 07:33.076
Tina, honey, this is really
hard on all of us.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.036
Will you just give it a try?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.873
It doesn't seem to be so
hard on Dr. Crews.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.875
He really wants to help you, Tina.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.669
I'd hate to see you go back
to the hospital.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.713
I guess you're right.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.191
There he is.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.487
- "Bad News" Crews.
- Tina.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.031
- Hi, Dr. Crews.
- Hi.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.991
I hope we didn't keep you
waiting too long.

08:13.159 --> 08:17.454
No, no, I really
like it up here. It's beautiful.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.458
- Did you have a good trip?
- It was a very nice drive.

08:21.626 --> 08:25.462
- Hi, Tina. How are you?
- Hi.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.635
- Hi.
- There goes the neighborhood.

08:34.554 --> 08:37.474
Nice outfit.
Looks like her mom dressed her.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.558
Melissa.

08:43.313 --> 08:46.191
So this is where it all started.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.485
Well, well, well.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.703
Dr. Crews, you really think that
we're doing the right thing, don't you?

08:58.871 --> 09:01.122
We've done all we can do for her
at the hospital.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.791
She hasn't made enough progress.

09:02.959 --> 09:08.004
I know it's tough on both of you
to come back here, but trust me.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.298
We'll do the best we can.

09:11.008 --> 09:12.801
You'll help her.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.431
So, what do you think of Nick?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.434
Gee, I hadn't noticed.

09:23.437 --> 09:24.813
Oh!

09:24.981 --> 09:27.190
- Let me help.
- That's all right. I can do it.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.608
- No, really, here.
- Really.

09:28.776 --> 09:29.943
No, it's no problem.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.615
- Uh, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.285
- Here.
- Thanks. You've been a great help.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.080
I don't know what I would've done
without you.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.172
Great, asshole.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.510
Do we really have to do this now?

09:55.678 --> 09:59.055
Tina, we're late already.
Just sit down, please.

10:10.901 --> 10:14.904
- Why am I seeing things?
- I don't know, Tina.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.741
Why do you think you're seeing things?

10:22.913 --> 10:25.415
Is that really necessary?

10:26.292 --> 10:28.209
What, the camera?

10:28.377 --> 10:31.504
I just wanna keep track
of our progress, all right?

10:31.922 --> 10:33.423
Now, uh....

10:35.134 --> 10:37.761
Let's get back to work, all right?

10:38.971 --> 10:41.306
Tina, look at me.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.849
See this matchbook?

10:43.934 --> 10:46.561
I'm gonna set it on the desk here.

10:47.396 --> 10:50.565
I want you to concentrate.
I want you to think about your feelings...

10:50.733 --> 10:54.694
...and just focus them in
on the matchbook.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.905
And maybe we can get it to move.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.094
- You're not trying, Tina.
- Yes, I am.

11:19.261 --> 11:23.014
Think about it moving and make it move.

11:28.312 --> 11:31.314
I can't! I told you,
I don't know how it happens.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.692
Sometimes it happens
and sometimes it doesn't!

11:33.859 --> 11:36.486
And you're lying to me!

11:36.654 --> 11:41.658
You are lying, because it happens
when your emotions are at their peak.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.869
Come on, you're holding back.
Concentrate.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.497
Concentrate, Tina!

11:58.050 --> 12:02.178
Well, well. What did you do?

12:03.597 --> 12:05.682
What went through your mind?

12:05.850 --> 12:07.559
I was thinking about you.

12:09.770 --> 12:12.605
Look, I don't know how
any of this is gonna help me.

12:12.773 --> 12:16.985
Your psychokinetic ability is a projection
of the suppressed guilt feelings you have.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.611
Would you speak English?

12:19.196 --> 12:22.323
You're more interested in this
telekinetic stuff than you are in me!

12:22.491 --> 12:23.742
That is not true, Tina.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.662
I'm here to help you overcome the guilt
that you have about your father's death.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.956
- That's all.
- That's bullshit!

12:35.337 --> 12:37.922
I rest my case.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.392
- Hey.
- Yes?

12:49.560 --> 12:53.688
If this is my uncle's house,
why are we sleeping in the van?

12:56.108 --> 12:57.734
Who says we're sleeping?

13:13.042 --> 13:14.125
Tina.

13:15.753 --> 13:16.920
Honey, are you all right?

13:17.087 --> 13:19.923
- Mom, I miss him so much.
- I know, I miss him too.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.138
Tina!

13:59.505 --> 14:02.549
<i>Please, baby, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.</i>

14:05.344 --> 14:09.097
- Tina!
- I hate you! I wish you were dead!

14:10.224 --> 14:12.016
John!

14:12.184 --> 14:13.893
I wish you were dead!

14:14.061 --> 14:16.980
No, Daddy. No!

14:17.147 --> 14:19.482
I'm sorry, Daddy.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.443
I'm so sorry.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.906
I wish I could bring you back.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.587
Daddy?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.990
Dr. Crews, it's Tina!

15:51.158 --> 15:56.079
- Tina, sweetheart, are you all right?
- Tina, what happened?

15:56.246 --> 15:57.747
Where is he?

16:01.418 --> 16:04.128
Dr. Crews, I saw him,
but I can't describe him.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.672
But you said "him."

16:05.839 --> 16:08.967
Are you saying a man came
out of the lake?

16:09.134 --> 16:13.137
I know what you're thinking,
but this has nothing to do with my father.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.101
Tina...

16:19.728 --> 16:21.938
...don't run away from it.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.650
Your guilt over your father's death is....
Well, it's a powerful thing.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.318
But it wasn't my father.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.904
Your mind is manufacturing
hallucinations because--

16:30.072 --> 16:32.490
- It wasn't a hallucination.
- Yes, it was.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.534
No!

16:41.166 --> 16:43.418
Piece of shit.

16:45.462 --> 16:48.131
When's the last time
you put oil in that thing?

16:48.298 --> 16:50.508
Yesterday.

16:57.975 --> 17:01.144
- Let's just camp here.
- But we're almost there.

17:01.311 --> 17:04.355
- Jane, woods is woods and I'm beat.
- Michael!

17:04.522 --> 17:08.358
What? We're gonna have to go back
to the car in the morning anyway.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.737
- Nick can take us.
- Nick?

17:11.238 --> 17:12.989
What would he be doing out here?

17:13.656 --> 17:15.867
- He's already here.
- What are you talking about?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.869
This was supposed to be
a surprise party for your birthday.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.874
Everybody's waiting for us to show up.
I got this great cabin and everything.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.334
No way.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.003
Never mind, the whole thing's ruined.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.422
Happy birthday.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.847
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.725
I washed this for you.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.853
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.355
- I'm Nick.
- I'm Amanda Shepard. Nice meeting you.

17:46.523 --> 17:49.150
- Nice to meet you.
- So have you been having fun up here?

17:49.318 --> 17:51.235
Yeah, a bunch of us got together...

17:51.403 --> 17:54.113
...to throw my cousin Michael, heh,
a surprise birthday party.

17:54.281 --> 17:57.450
- I came over to invite your daughter.
- I don't know.

17:57.618 --> 18:01.287
Well, you can always spend
the evening with me and Dr. Crews.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.834
- Let's go, heh. Bye.
- Bye. Have a good time.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.798
Where'd she go? Uh, who's that boy?

18:11.965 --> 18:15.051
Oh, relax, Dr. Crews, she's just
going to visit the kids next door.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.137
But I thought we agreed,
no distractions. I mean, I'd....

18:18.305 --> 18:20.306
I'd hate to send her back
to the hospital.

18:20.474 --> 18:25.394
She just needs a chance to be normal.
Isn't that what this is all about?

18:25.854 --> 18:27.522
Yes, of course it is.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.234
This is some birthday.

18:31.401 --> 18:35.321
It's gonna be a great birthday. Promise.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.923
Hey, be back in two shakes.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.092
Just hurry.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.744
Michael, get a move on.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.789
- Christ! It's cold out here!
- Ha, ha.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.493
Jane?

21:02.177 --> 21:03.636
A party. You know,
cake and ice cream.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.681
Oh, shit! Nick, help me out.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.849
- Whoa! Got it.
- I need an objective opinion.

21:09.017 --> 21:12.478
- No, grab it underneath. It's wet.
- Is anybody making the popcorn?

21:13.438 --> 21:16.607
What do you think of Starlycon?

21:16.775 --> 21:20.486
Thirty thousand years into the future,
the entire galaxy is populated...

21:20.654 --> 21:22.989
- ...by highly evolved protozoa.
- Thanks a lot.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.407
- Good, huh?
- You all right?

21:24.574 --> 21:26.409
Only one human
being and his woman...

21:26.576 --> 21:29.203
- ...still exist amongst the stars.
- Just give me a drink.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.289
I see you met our resident writer, Eddie.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.791
- Ice cream and cake, huh?
- Just something with alcohol.

21:33.959 --> 21:38.629
Eddie's a little out there, Tina, but believe me,
everybody else here, perfectly normal.

21:48.515 --> 21:51.851
So he goes, "Let me see your ID."
So I go, "Well, I left it at home."

21:52.019 --> 21:55.146
And he goes, "You have to go
and get it." So I go, "Okay." And I go.

21:55.314 --> 21:59.066
Put something under that drink, all right?
You're gonna ruin the table.

21:59.234 --> 22:02.611
- Outrageous.
- You like him?

22:02.779 --> 22:04.822
Me too.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.534
What is this?
Ah, will you look at this?

22:08.702 --> 22:10.202
The party hasn't even started...

22:10.370 --> 22:13.748
...and already this place looks like
closing time at the stock exchange.

22:13.915 --> 22:17.585
- Russ, honey, we'll clean it up. I promise.
- Yeah, chill out, Brooks Brothers.

22:17.753 --> 22:21.756
But they're eating my uncle's food.
We're supposed to bring our own food.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.342
He's gonna shit.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.973
- Everybody, this is Tina from next door.
- You guys!

22:31.141 --> 22:33.184
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:34.728 --> 22:35.811
- Ow.
- Oh, shit!

22:35.979 --> 22:37.021
Fuck!
Where did that come from?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.439
- What was that?
- Nick, help me.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.192
- Tina....
- Why are these people such slobs?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.152
Trouble.

22:43.320 --> 22:46.906
Now, there's a guy I'd love
to give a surprise party for.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.742
- Hi, I'm Melissa.
- I'm Tina, from next door.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.452
I know.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.496
Whose friend is that scuzzball dopehead?

22:53.663 --> 22:55.373
Only the birthday boy's best friend.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.793
Melissa, those are so pretty.
They're absolutely gorgeous.

22:58.960 --> 23:03.005
- What a stupid place to put a lamp.
- They're real.

23:03.173 --> 23:07.385
On my last birthday, my daddy goes,
"Melissa, you're the perfect daughter."

23:07.552 --> 23:12.306
And he gives me these and says,
"To the best little girl in the whole world."

23:14.142 --> 23:16.477
Ah, disgusting.
Look, it's all over me.

23:26.822 --> 23:30.199
- Tina, wait a minute. Come back here.
- Who is that girl?

23:30.367 --> 23:33.369
Nick, let me tell you
something about women.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.676
- Mom?
- Tina? Honey, what is it?

23:48.844 --> 23:50.386
- Mom, I saw him again.
- Who? What?

23:50.554 --> 23:52.721
The man, the thing in the lake,
I saw him again.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.807
He was killing a boy with a metal spike.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.268
Tina, relax, relax. Relax, relax.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.311
What do you mean, you saw "it"?

23:59.479 --> 24:04.108
Well, I didn't actually see it,
but I know. I know.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.569
Okay.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.821
What were you doing
right before it happened?

24:08.989 --> 24:11.490
- Why?
- Because these are delusions.

24:11.658 --> 24:13.909
Tina, you're creating images
of your father.

24:14.077 --> 24:17.204
All right. Well, he left a large delusion
stuck in our back porch.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.748
Why don't you just go look,
if you don't believe me.

24:19.916 --> 24:20.958
All right. Okay.

24:22.335 --> 24:23.627
Okay, I will.

24:23.795 --> 24:27.840
- Tina....
- I know I'm right. I'm right.

24:34.806 --> 24:37.808
Tina? Mrs. Shepard?

24:39.144 --> 24:41.228
Tina, where? I....

24:45.025 --> 24:51.113
But it was here. It was right here,
the large spike that I saw.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.453
What's happening to me?

24:57.621 --> 24:59.830
Help me, please.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.540
Shh, shh, shh.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.168
I'll help you,
but you have to help me.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.630
Honey, come on in the house.
Come on, sweetie. Come on, in the house.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.632
- It was there.
- Okay.

25:09.799 --> 25:12.468
It was there.
I just don't know what's happening.

25:12.969 --> 25:14.762
It's okay.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.680
It's okay.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.687
I'm cold.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.982
- Why don't we crawl in the sack?
- Why don't you fix the fire?

25:27.150 --> 25:30.528
- There's no wood.
- Heh, we're in a forest.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.697
Come on, let me heat you up.

25:34.324 --> 25:37.701
Dan, we need wood.

25:38.453 --> 25:41.580
It's gonna be a cold night tonight.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.670
I'll be back.

27:20.597 --> 27:24.683
Okay, you big hunk of a man,
come and get me.

27:27.103 --> 27:29.104
Dan?

27:36.780 --> 27:38.781
Dan, what are you doing?

28:09.854 --> 28:11.480
It was great.

28:11.648 --> 28:14.358
Derrick F. Z. Simms' greatest film.

28:14.526 --> 28:18.028
<i>The Battle of the Gargantuan Throngar
was a work of genius.</i>

28:18.196 --> 28:20.280
- Right, Eddie.
- Hey, you don't have to take...

28:20.448 --> 28:22.908
- ...my word for it. Ask Ben, he was there.
- What?

28:23.076 --> 28:25.577
Ben, why don't you tell us
all about Throngar.

28:25.745 --> 28:29.498
- Throng what?
- Oh, no, my mistake. lt wasn't Ben.

28:29.666 --> 28:33.085
Gee, look at the time.
Gotta get moving, get something on paper.

28:33.253 --> 28:36.213
Uh, some surprise party
that turned out to be, huh?

28:36.381 --> 28:38.799
Michael probably got pulled over
for drunk driving...

28:38.967 --> 28:40.467
...and spent the night in jail.

28:40.635 --> 28:44.179
I mean, the guy can smell a party
1 00 miles away. He'll be here.

28:44.723 --> 28:48.225
- Now, where's my coffee?
- Where would you like it?

28:49.185 --> 28:51.061
Has anyone seen Nick?

28:51.229 --> 28:54.815
I think he went next door
to see Marilyn Munster, heh.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.993
Your friends must think
I'm a complete joke.

29:06.619 --> 29:09.538
Yeah, who cares what they think?
They're not my friends.

29:10.331 --> 29:14.376
I just came up for my cousin.
So where are you from?

29:14.544 --> 29:18.172
- Where are you from?
- We're doing real good here, aren't we?

29:18.923 --> 29:21.216
Okay, here goes.

29:21.384 --> 29:24.845
I grew up in Pittsburgh,
I used to hang out with a real bad crowd.

29:25.221 --> 29:29.767
Then my dad kicked me out and now
I go to night school. Your turn.

29:31.311 --> 29:35.481
We used to come up here all the time
till my dad got killed in the lake.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.109
I don't like it here.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.451
Oh, is this where...?

29:47.952 --> 29:50.454
I think it was my fault.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.123
I know it was my fault.

29:54.083 --> 29:57.336
Look, you're a really nice guy
trying to get your life together.

29:57.504 --> 29:58.837
You don't wanna mess around with me.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.341
Just listen for just a minute.

30:02.509 --> 30:05.427
I saw my father get killed
when I was a kid.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.889
It really messed up my head a lot.

30:09.057 --> 30:14.353
- So you're okay now. Aren't you?
- You know that guy in my house?

30:14.521 --> 30:18.774
He's my doctor. He came out
to help me from a mental hospital.

30:44.217 --> 30:47.427
I.... Um, I saw it.

30:48.638 --> 30:52.474
It's a big, pink elephant.

30:56.396 --> 31:02.401
You know, with my luck, you're probably
gonna turn out to be another delusion, heh.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.501
Good morning, heh.

31:19.669 --> 31:22.838
- Heh, well, what was that for?
- Nothing.

31:23.006 --> 31:24.381
- Nothing?
- Mm-hm.

31:28.511 --> 31:31.847
- Hello, Tina.
- Hi.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.310
We've got tomatoes,
peppers, onions....

31:36.477 --> 31:39.521
Sandra, don't do it that way.
It's gonna fall through the grill.

31:39.689 --> 31:43.025
Okay, let's see what else.
Garlic, pepper....

31:43.192 --> 31:45.152
Well, great.

31:46.279 --> 31:49.865
Move it! Steve, come on.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.534
Bye.

31:52.702 --> 31:57.205
- Did you cut all the tomatoes?
- Yeah. They're all done.

31:57.373 --> 32:00.500
It looks great.
What happened with you and Ben?

32:00.668 --> 32:03.045
He blew me off to go out
with Eddie the other night.

32:03.212 --> 32:05.589
- I can't believe he lied.
- What's wrong with Kate?

32:05.757 --> 32:07.799
Just throw the ball.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.847
Look at this.
It's made with latex.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.184
- Have you seen Nick?
- He's around.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.269
Dip?

32:20.772 --> 32:24.691
She's like that with everybody
except boys. Come on.

32:25.151 --> 32:26.944
Cocktail hour.

32:28.154 --> 32:32.699
Ah, Robin, did you see the way
David just looked at me?

32:35.328 --> 32:38.580
Oh, get real, Maddy.
You're not his type.

32:38.748 --> 32:41.375
You need a little touchup work first.

32:42.001 --> 32:43.627
Thanks.

32:43.836 --> 32:46.588
The Colombian Express
is pulling out. All aboard.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.590
Ding, ding, heh.

32:49.384 --> 32:54.930
- Hey, Eddie, wanna do me a favor?
- Yeah, sure. Anything.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.224
- I'm gonna do it.
- Robin, you don't smoke.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.184
- I do now.
- No, you can't. Robin.

32:59.477 --> 33:00.852
You and I made a deal.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.438
We were gonna come here
and have a good time, right?

33:03.606 --> 33:07.275
Well, I'm gonna stick to the deal.
You in?

33:07.443 --> 33:09.444
Okay.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.363
- Hi.
- Hi, David.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.407
Come on.

33:13.574 --> 33:15.867
So you wanna smoke with me?

33:16.035 --> 33:17.160
- Yeah.
- Good.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.788
So is Nick here or not?
I really wanna talk to him.

33:19.956 --> 33:21.498
Don't worry, he'll show.

33:21.666 --> 33:26.169
Hey, Tina, isn't this the way they wear
their jackets in the mental hospital?

33:29.674 --> 33:31.466
What's she doing?

33:38.016 --> 33:39.725
<i>- Ah.
-Wow.</i>

33:41.310 --> 33:42.894
God, heh.

33:46.399 --> 33:49.192
- What happened?
- Tina.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.778
Hey, wait, Tina!

33:54.907 --> 33:57.409
What's going on, you guys?

33:59.829 --> 34:01.496
I hate this place.

34:01.664 --> 34:05.834
He's making me do things that
I don't wanna do. I'm seeing things.

34:06.002 --> 34:08.545
I could've killed somebody.
How could I have done that?

34:08.713 --> 34:12.507
Because, Tina, when you're highly emotional,
you do almost anything, you see.

34:12.675 --> 34:14.801
It just proves my point.

34:14.969 --> 34:17.721
I mean, you made the matchbook
move, you broke the pearls.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.098
If you can believe
that I did those things...

34:20.266 --> 34:23.018
...then why can't you believe that
I saw someone get killed?

34:23.186 --> 34:25.187
We do believe you, Tina.

34:25.353 --> 34:28.607
Your psychokinesis and these delusions
are just all tied together.

34:28.775 --> 34:32.569
No, you're not listening to me!
You haven't heard a single word I've said!

34:32.737 --> 34:35.197
Can we go back now?
I don't wanna stay here anymore!

34:35.364 --> 34:38.158
Go back where, Tina? Look at me!
Back to the hospital?

34:38.326 --> 34:41.203
We're starting to make some real
progress because you are here.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.621
- Please!
- We'll go back tomorrow.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.498
- You can't leave.
- It's not working.

34:44.665 --> 34:48.376
Do you wanna throw this all away?
We're at a very critical point right now!

34:48.543 --> 34:51.213
Do you wanna see her in the hospital
for the rest of her life?

34:51.380 --> 34:54.174
- Is that what you want?
- Look what you're doing to her!

35:09.232 --> 35:12.567
- Hey. Whoa. Whoa. Where you going?
- Oh, Nick, I wanna get out of here.

35:12.735 --> 35:15.821
- Melissa was a bitch.
- No, forget Melissa.

35:15.988 --> 35:19.616
There's something really wrong here.
I know it, and no one else believes me.

35:19.784 --> 35:24.412
- Tina, what are you talking about?
- Did your cousin ever show up?

35:25.748 --> 35:27.958
- No, he didn't.
- Well, what did...?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.417
What does he look like?

35:29.585 --> 35:31.795
I don't see what this has to do
with anything.

35:31.963 --> 35:35.298
Can you tell me what he looks like?
Do you have a picture or something?

35:35.466 --> 35:38.426
Yeah, I do. I think I do.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.930
It's right here.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.808
Oh, God.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.185
What?

35:47.353 --> 35:48.937
I think he's dead, Nick.

35:50.439 --> 35:53.775
Tina, pack your things,
we're gonna leave in the morning.

36:09.292 --> 36:12.252
When did you first fall
in love with me?

36:12.420 --> 36:18.550
The first time I saw the enormous
size of your beautiful...wallet.

36:18.718 --> 36:22.304
Heh, there was this huge bulge in
your pants just calling out my name.

36:22.471 --> 36:26.224
"Sandra, Sandra, take me now."

36:27.727 --> 36:29.895
- You coming?
- What are you doing?

36:30.062 --> 36:33.231
Come on. You chicken.

36:33.649 --> 36:35.650
You're crazy.

36:36.986 --> 36:39.154
Gonna go for a little swim?

36:42.992 --> 36:44.910
Okay.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.421
You need a formal invitation?

36:56.589 --> 36:59.549
Russell, party for two,
right this way, please, heh.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.195
No!

37:22.657 --> 37:23.698
Russell, come on.

37:25.159 --> 37:28.078
Russell! Russell!

37:54.981 --> 37:59.442
King Tut rises from the tomb.

37:59.610 --> 38:03.446
So we go to all this trouble
and no Michael. Typical.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.740
- Know what I like about you?
- What?

38:05.908 --> 38:09.077
You hardly sweat at all.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.662
You wanna get high?

38:22.091 --> 38:26.303
So, what do you wanna do?
Hit me?

38:27.430 --> 38:31.182
Come on, Michael.
Come on, answer the phone.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.643
I love you...

38:33.811 --> 38:36.187
...squid-face.

39:10.348 --> 39:14.392
Look, Michael has not shown up yet,
so I'm gonna go in the woods and look for him.

39:15.436 --> 39:18.313
Hi, Nick. Are you still mad at me?

39:18.481 --> 39:20.940
What was that crap you pulled
on Tina this afternoon?

39:21.108 --> 39:26.529
That chick's crazy.
Besides, all is fair in love and war.

39:26.697 --> 39:31.451
- Melissa, I don't even like you.
- Heh, "Like" has nothing to do with it.

39:31.619 --> 39:35.538
<i>I know. Star Mummy.</i>

39:35.998 --> 39:38.249
Excuse me. Hey.

39:39.502 --> 39:42.629
We have got to get to know
each other better.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.088
Are you joking?

40:25.256 --> 40:28.174
Now, why would I do that?

40:28.342 --> 40:30.885
You really think I'm cute?

40:31.053 --> 40:33.346
Of course I do.

40:33.514 --> 40:36.141
Since when?

40:36.308 --> 40:38.935
I've always thought so.

40:39.103 --> 40:42.647
You've just been too
blind to notice.

40:43.232 --> 40:45.442
Dr. Crews?

42:45.229 --> 42:47.188
<i>I told you,
I don't know how it happened.</i>

42:47.356 --> 42:51.442
<i>The Anderson case
in '65. The documentation here is much greater.</i>

42:51.610 --> 42:54.028
<i>By keeping Tina's trauma
and stress levels high...</i>

42:54.196 --> 42:58.866
<i>...I am confident I can induce
huge psychokinetic reactions.</i>

42:59.034 --> 43:01.536
What do you think you're doing?

43:01.704 --> 43:06.040
You... You never intended to help her.

43:06.792 --> 43:09.752
Be reasonable.
That's why I'm here.

43:09.920 --> 43:13.423
First I find this spike and
then this.... This....

43:13.591 --> 43:18.011
- What have you been doing to my daughter?
- I have been trying to help her.

43:18.178 --> 43:23.391
What's this? ls this what Tina's talking about?
Have you been hiding this all this time?

43:23.559 --> 43:26.769
I can't expect you to understand
this highly complicated process...

43:26.937 --> 43:31.691
- ...that is integral to your daughter's treatment.
- Liar! I can see what you've been doing.

43:31.859 --> 43:34.861
You have deliberately turned
my daughter into an emotional wreck.

43:35.029 --> 43:36.571
That's not true.

43:36.739 --> 43:41.576
Mrs. Shepard, what you saw was....
Was a side effect of her treatment.

43:44.121 --> 43:45.997
Treatment?

43:48.417 --> 43:50.752
You bastard.

43:51.295 --> 43:55.715
You brought her here so that
you could watch her perform.

43:55.883 --> 43:58.384
- It's out of your hands.
- How could you do this to her?

43:58.552 --> 44:02.013
I don't care what you say,
I'm her doctor.

44:02.181 --> 44:06.225
We'll put her in the hospital. We'll begin
psychotropic drug therapy right away.

44:06.393 --> 44:09.812
Do you...? Do you really think
that I'd ever let you see her again?

44:09.980 --> 44:11.898
Mrs. Shepard, she needs help.

44:12.066 --> 44:14.692
She's dangerous to herself,
she's dangerous to all of us.

44:14.860 --> 44:17.236
How can you say that?
She's not dangerous.

44:17.404 --> 44:19.447
She killed her father.
Look what she's tried to do with me.

44:19.615 --> 44:22.367
I see no other choice
but to get her into the hospital.

44:22.534 --> 44:25.662
- No.
- Mrs. Shepard...

44:25.829 --> 44:30.291
...I'm gonna have to commit her,
even if it is against your wishes.

44:39.468 --> 44:40.510
Tina?

44:41.887 --> 44:43.638
Tina, no!

45:05.160 --> 45:06.994
Mom?

45:07.162 --> 45:08.955
No!

46:00.883 --> 46:04.886
"Need a little touchup work,"
my ass.

46:17.733 --> 46:19.984
David?

46:24.823 --> 46:27.366
David, are you out there?

46:28.452 --> 46:30.203
David?

46:33.791 --> 46:35.583
David?

47:04.321 --> 47:06.572
Where are you?

47:09.368 --> 47:11.327
David!

47:16.959 --> 47:19.168
My earring.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.982
Ah, thank God.

49:54.449 --> 49:55.658
- Nick.
- Tina.

49:55.826 --> 49:59.203
I just saw my mom.
I've gotta go find her.

50:04.251 --> 50:05.793
What's that?

50:08.630 --> 50:10.965
Tina? Tina!

50:11.133 --> 50:13.384
Oh, my God!

50:14.052 --> 50:15.803
- She's gone.
- Oh, no. No.

50:15.971 --> 50:18.806
- What if she's hurt?
- We didn't pass her on the road.

50:18.974 --> 50:21.559
Tina! Tina!

50:21.727 --> 50:24.895
Wait, wait. Wait a minute!
Don't go! Don't leave!

50:34.406 --> 50:35.448
Ouch.

50:35.615 --> 50:36.782
- What?
- Your watch.

50:36.950 --> 50:39.618
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God.

51:17.866 --> 51:19.950
What's that?

51:20.118 --> 51:23.537
- What?
- That.

51:23.705 --> 51:29.043
- Oh, shit. I hope it isn't Michael.
- Oh, what timing.

51:29.211 --> 51:33.172
- Quick, get a balloon.
- Yeah, right. Happy fucking birthday.

51:33.965 --> 51:36.550
You're here at last, birthday boy.
Stop shaking the van.

51:36.718 --> 51:38.886
- Let's surprise him, heh.
- Heh, right.

51:39.054 --> 51:41.180
On the count of three. You ready?

51:41.348 --> 51:44.558
- One, two, three.
- Ahem

51:44.726 --> 51:47.061
- Go. Surprise!
- Surprise!

51:48.855 --> 51:52.525
- Where is he?
- He's probably out there somewhere.

51:53.276 --> 51:56.112
- Let's get him.
- I'm not going out there.

51:56.279 --> 51:58.614
Come on, the motherfucker's
out there.

51:58.782 --> 52:00.741
I'm gonna get him.

52:00.909 --> 52:03.119
Make it fast.

52:03.286 --> 52:05.496
Be right back.

52:09.251 --> 52:11.710
All right, Michael.

52:11.878 --> 52:12.920
Come on.

52:14.297 --> 52:16.090
Where are you, buddy, huh?

52:20.595 --> 52:23.347
Come on, Michael.

52:23.515 --> 52:25.850
Where are you, buddy? Come on.

52:29.604 --> 52:33.149
Ben, are you coming back or not?

52:49.291 --> 52:52.126
Ben, where are you?

53:04.764 --> 53:06.640
Ben!

53:07.267 --> 53:09.101
Michael?

53:09.644 --> 53:12.146
Hey, I'm talking to you.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.524
Stop screwing around.

53:20.989 --> 53:22.323
Eddie.

53:22.490 --> 53:23.991
Eddie.

53:25.368 --> 53:26.994
This just isn't gonna work out.

53:27.162 --> 53:29.205
- What's the matter?
- I lied.

53:29.372 --> 53:31.665
- Lied about what?
- About everything.

53:31.833 --> 53:34.126
You just don't turn me on.
Really.

53:34.836 --> 53:38.839
Look, come on,
at least I gave you a chance.

53:39.090 --> 53:40.674
You just didn't come through.

53:41.092 --> 53:46.013
Anyway, I was kind of hoping Nick
would come back and find you with me.

53:46.306 --> 53:51.101
- Why'd you lie?
- You know. Make him jealous.

53:52.020 --> 53:54.313
Rejection.

53:54.481 --> 53:57.983
Okay. Fine. I can take it.

53:58.818 --> 54:00.986
I've been rejected by
some of the finest...

54:01.154 --> 54:05.074
...science-fiction magazines
in the continental United States.

54:06.451 --> 54:08.953
Eddie, where are you going?

54:09.120 --> 54:14.166
To take a cold shower.
I got a date with a soap on a rope.

54:45.991 --> 54:47.992
What happened to the lights?

54:48.159 --> 54:50.327
Who cares?

54:52.914 --> 54:54.915
Come here.

55:04.467 --> 55:06.302
Michael?

55:11.558 --> 55:13.475
Michael.

55:19.858 --> 55:21.358
I knew it.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.445
I saw it.

55:27.866 --> 55:33.078
Oh, Nick, I'm sorry. But we've gotta
keep going, we've gotta get out of here.

55:44.883 --> 55:48.927
- I'm hungry.
- How romantic.

55:49.095 --> 55:52.014
I'm really stoned.

55:52.182 --> 55:57.394
The Neanderthal man,
hunter-gatherer, seeks nourishment.

56:05.445 --> 56:06.862
Ooh.

56:10.241 --> 56:12.493
It's dark.

56:31.429 --> 56:34.640
- Here.
- Gee, thanks.

56:36.684 --> 56:38.185
- Bye.
- Bye.

56:59.624 --> 57:02.292
What the fuck?

57:31.322 --> 57:33.490
Maddy?

57:47.046 --> 57:48.338
What are you looking for?

57:48.506 --> 57:51.341
My father's pistol. I know that
he has one in here somewhere.

57:56.514 --> 57:58.807
Crews knew.

58:17.952 --> 58:21.288
- What'd you find?
- I don't know.

58:22.332 --> 58:26.126
Come on, Tina,
let's go get the others now.

58:26.294 --> 58:27.836
Oh, this is important.

58:30.048 --> 58:32.883
Jason Voorhees.

58:36.221 --> 58:39.223
It was him in the lake.

58:39.390 --> 58:41.558
What are you talking about?

58:52.070 --> 58:53.529
Oh, my God, that's you.

59:11.506 --> 59:14.716
"Happy birthday, Michael.
You lucky son of a bitch.

59:14.884 --> 59:18.762
Many happy returns.
Love, Melissa."

59:18.930 --> 59:20.764
Cunt.

59:48.626 --> 59:51.795
"Personal penis enlarger."

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:10.981
You all right? You sure?

01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:13.984
Listen. If this Jason guy
is really out there, Tina...

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:18.155
...I wanna get everybody together
so we can get the hell out of here.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:21.992
- What, Tina? What is it?
- She's in the woods, Nick.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.287
- Who?
- My mother. I know that's where she is.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.998
All right. We'll find her, Tina.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:31.460
We'll find her, but let's get everybody
so we can leave together.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.057
So change your mind or what?

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:46.808
Melissa?

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.126
Maddy?

01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:11.601
David?

01:02:12.603 --> 01:02:14.396
David?

01:02:23.322 --> 01:02:25.782
Are you in here?

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:03.153
David?

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:12.204
David, are you in there?

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:40.065
Just a cat.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:42.067
Kitty.

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:48.198
Come here, kitty.

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.828
Whose kitty are you, huh?

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:55.455
Are you David's kitty?

01:03:56.666 --> 01:04:00.043
No, David doesn't have a kitty.

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:06.883
You're cute. Yes, you are. What?

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:14.558
You scared, kitty?
Don't be scared.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:18.019
Where are you going, hmm?

01:04:37.623 --> 01:04:39.165
No!

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:52.804
- Tina.
- I've gotta go find her.

01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:54.723
Can we get everybody
together first?

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:58.351
I can't go with you. What if she
comes back and I'm not here?

01:04:58.519 --> 01:05:03.940
- I don't wanna leave you alone.
- Well, then, you go. You go.

01:05:04.108 --> 01:05:06.443
And I'll stay right here.

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:10.071
- Just hurry back.
- Don't move.

01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:30.842
David?

01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:34.387
Maddy?

01:05:45.524 --> 01:05:47.192
Tina?

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.777
- Tina!
- Mrs. Shepard.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.946
- Answer me! Where are you?
- Look at me.

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:53.615
You're wasting time.
She's probably back at the house.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.784
- Do you know that?
- You saw the car. Tina!

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.661
Let's call the police, all right?

01:05:57.828 --> 01:06:00.288
- Why? Damn it, she's out here!
- We are wasting time.

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:03.333
Don't you understand that,
Mrs. Shepard?

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:05.543
- What's the matter with you?
- Wait, wait.

01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:09.673
Nothing.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.842
- What is it? What aren't you telling me?
- I'm gonna leave.

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:14.636
You can find your own way back.

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:19.474
You're not just a lousy doctor,
you're a fucking coward!

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.643
Give me that key.

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:56.052
Listen to me. Tina knew.
She tried to tell us. She did.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.555
- What? What are you doing?
- Oh, my God!

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:00.890
No! No!

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.983
Maddy?

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:12.736
Melissa? Anybody?

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.947
Tina?

01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:00.784
Tina!

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:19.301
Jesus Christ.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:23.264
- Where's Tina?
- A psych ward. How should I know?

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.265
- Eddie's dead.
- What?

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:28.685
He's dead. Michael's dead too.
I saw him.

01:08:29.145 --> 01:08:32.649
- Get real.
- Just don't go over there, Melissa.

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:35.819
Okay.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:57.756
Tina. Tina! Shh. Shh. You have to come back
with me now, please.

01:08:57.925 --> 01:09:00.176
What are you doing here?
Where's my mother?

01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:03.513
She's, um.... She's back at the house.
Come on, please.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.265
- You're lying!
- I am not lying!

01:09:05.432 --> 01:09:07.600
- You're lying, I was just there!
- Tina, please.

01:09:07.768 --> 01:09:10.310
When I tell you to come back,
I mean it! Come--

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:12.814
Blood?

01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:18.027
What happened? What did you do?

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:22.615
You've gotta help me.
We've gotta get out of here.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:25.535
Where is she? Where's my mother?

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.703
- She's gone.
- What?

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.831
She's gone.

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:32.709
- Tina. Tina!
- Mother!

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:35.795
Tina, don't go in there! Tina!

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:26.781
Mom?

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.616
Mom!

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:31.119
Mama! Oh, God!

01:11:54.184 --> 01:11:57.562
Kate, is that you?

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.606
Kate?

01:12:00.774 --> 01:12:02.483
Kate?

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:34.057
Jason?

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:49.627
What the hell?

01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:53.214
Tina?

01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:58.094
- Tina.
- My mom.

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:00.596
He got my mom.

01:16:00.764 --> 01:16:02.765
Who?

01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:05.101
I killed him.

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:08.062
Jason's dead.

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:11.232
Okay, okay, shh, shh.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.109
All right.

01:16:22.452 --> 01:16:24.537
- You are nuts.
- Shut up, Melissa.

01:16:24.955 --> 01:16:26.789
I don't believe you.

01:16:26.957 --> 01:16:30.251
You people give me the creeps.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.461
Hey, where do you think you're going?

01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:35.464
I'm going back to bed.
You wanna come?

01:16:38.468 --> 01:16:43.139
- Look, Melissa, just stay here with us.
- It's not my style.

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:46.851
- Don't go out there!
- Fuck you.

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:50.146
No. No, fuck you both!

01:17:07.539 --> 01:17:09.165
Careful.

01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:13.878
- Go!
- Ahh!

01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:16.422
Shit!

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:19.759
- Run!
- Ahh!

01:17:29.686 --> 01:17:31.854
Shit! Ugh!

01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:34.523
Tina, come and--

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:38.235
Tina, what are you doing?

01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:03.594
Come on.

01:18:32.332 --> 01:18:34.250
No!

01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:20.588
Nick?

01:21:46.776 --> 01:21:50.029
Tina, come on! Go!

01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:08.797
Run! Hit the deck!

01:22:08.965 --> 01:22:10.507
Go!

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:29.526
Are you okay?

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:33.072
Are you okay?

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:36.325
It's all gone.

01:22:38.536 --> 01:22:41.246
Everything's gone.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:45.292
Shh.

01:22:49.547 --> 01:22:51.632
It's okay.

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:58.806
Let's get out of here.

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:06.021
No! Tina!

01:23:58.408 --> 01:24:00.492
Daddy?

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:07.207
- Right there.
- Over here.

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:17.384
Pretty much got her under control,
but, uh, we may need some backup.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:19.261
Help me with this,
will you, Charlie?

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:22.306
I need.... I need about four guys over here.
That should do it.

01:24:22.474 --> 01:24:24.600
How's she doing?

01:24:25.685 --> 01:24:28.771
Nick? Nick?

01:24:28.938 --> 01:24:30.272
He's all right.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.608
I just found another one.

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:37.112
A little more hose, please.

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:45.370
I got it, I got it.

01:24:50.168 --> 01:24:55.005
- Jason. Where's Jason?
- We took care of him.
