FRED: You're looking at
the many noble rabbits

00:59.142 --> 01:01.258
who have served as
the Easter Bunny.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.723
I you've ever
gotten a basket of candy

01:03.897 --> 01:05.808
and colored eggs
on Easter morning,

01:05.941 --> 01:07.806
you have them to thank.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.729
Yes, even that guy.

01:09.820 --> 01:14.280
See, every bunny
dreams of holding the title,
but not just anyone can do it.

01:14.658 --> 01:18.321
You have to be majestic.
You have to be dignified.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.992
You have to be, well, a bunny.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.156
Or, at least you did.

01:24.751 --> 01:28.664
Hi. I'm Fred O'Hare,
the first human Easter Bunny.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.087
Sounds insane, you say?

01:31.508 --> 01:34.341
It'll make sense once you know
how it all went down.

Hi, Dad!

02:43.872 --> 02:44.907
Woohoo!

02:45.040 --> 02:46.996
Oh! There you are.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.329
Son! I was thinking.

02:49.586 --> 02:53.420
You are gerring so big,
you're practically
a foot tall.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.664
Over a foot,
if you count the ears.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.670
I always
count the ears.

02:57.761 --> 02:58.841
(LAUGHS)

02:58.929 --> 03:01.420
So, how would you Iike
to go to work
with me today?

03:01.682 --> 03:04.048
Would I?
That sounds awesome.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.889
I said the same
thing when my father
first took me to the factory.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.059
I didn't use
the word "awesome," but...
Down, please.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.399
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

03:23.370 --> 03:25.907

Whoa!

03:53.984 --> 03:56.066
Look at all that candy.

Come on, come on.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.418
See you.

to the Easter Factory.

It's pretty impressive,
isn't it?

05:44.761 --> 05:46.376
It's amazing, Dad!

05:46.596 --> 05:51.056
I'm glad you like ir,
because someday
this will all be yours.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.761
Really?

05:53.395 --> 05:56.262
Now, come on, Son.
There's so much ro see.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.982
E.B.: Daddy, what do you
call that thingamajig?

06:01.152 --> 06:03.939
Ah, rhe Marshmallow
Chick Machine.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.611

I was your age.

When your grand-dad,
the Easter Bunny before me,

06:08.827 --> 06:10.237
took me on this
very same tour...

06:15.458 --> 06:17.244
Hello.
Hello, little bunny.

06:17.919 --> 06:18.954
What are you doing?

06:19.087 --> 06:21.829
We don't eat the candy.
We make the candy!

This is my second-in-command,
Carlos.

06:25.969 --> 06:30.804
It's fine, Carlos.
E.B. was, uh, taste-testing.
Isn't that right, Son?

06:31.433 --> 06:34.800
Yup, I'm taste-testing.
It's great.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.637
Oh, dear me. No, no.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.805
Son, we're going to have
to work on your taste.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.103
Carlos, too much marsh,
not enough mallow.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.480
Exactly, señor,
I was just going
to say that.

we can't make any mistakes.

The entire world
is counting on us.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.639
This seems hard, Dad.
And I don't know
if I can do it.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.972
Oh, come now.
Don't you worry, Son.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.524
Yes, it's
a big responsibility,
but you'II be ready.

07:24.653 --> 07:25.733
You'll have to be.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.854

you will pick up

10:01.726 --> 10:03.933
I had rehearsals for
the Easter play today.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.142
Oh.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.767
They usually cast
a boy as Peter Cottontail,

10:08.608 --> 10:10.223
but they made
an exception for me

on account of my
singing voice is so strong.

That's great, honey.

Good to hear
that two of my kids
are working so hard.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.872
So, Fred. How did
that job interview go?

10:30.547 --> 10:31.753
I don't know
about that place, Dad.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.872
I just don't know
if it's really
what I'm Iooking for.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.881

Did they pay money?

what you've been looking for.

as your mother I
have always Ioved you,

He just laid on
the couch all day
watching court shows,

11:18.761 --> 11:20.342
but then they had
an intervention,

11:20.430 --> 11:22.842
and now he
works in a pharmacy,
and has an apartment.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.548
I don't really want
to work at a pharmacy, Mom.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.635
Well, you need
to do something.
You need to get a Iife.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.437
You need to get a job
and you need to move out.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.726
Especially that last one.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.274
But I did move out.
And I had a job.

back on the horse.

much potential.

think you adopted me

such a disappointment.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.492
Wow.

Alex, that is
a very hurtful statement.

I go on job interviews.
I had one today!

11:58.218 --> 12:01.005
Yes, but it wasn'r
what you were Iooking for.
It's always something.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.380
You didn't like the commure.

was too far away
from the building.

next to you smelled.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.345
He smelled.
Fred,

12:08.519 --> 12:09.929
nothing is ever
good enough for you.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.386
You don't want me
to settle, do you?

12:11.564 --> 12:12.599

you said that
when I grew up I was
going to do something great.

Yes. But now I'm telling you
that you should
forget about "great,"

and settle for
getting any job.

wouldn't do that" and

has to be perfect."

a metaphorical sock.

a good enough egg,

but I mighr be
the best sock ever.

great at something else.

Why, I think that's fine.

nice that you have a hobby.

It's not a hobby, Dad.

I needed a sofr bed

Oh, I see. So, you climbed
a flight of stairs...

31:43.151 --> 31:45.984

Worth it, though.

Okay, I admit it.
I'm not a blues man.
My name is E.B.

42:30.923 --> 42:32.584
I'm just some
guy off the street

42:32.759 --> 42:34.465
wirh two sticks of
wood and a dream.

42:34.635 --> 42:35.920
I understand if
you throw me out.

42:36.012 --> 42:37.468
I get it if you don't
want to give me a break.

42:37.597 --> 42:39.133
Hey, slow down, friend.

42:39.265 --> 42:43.349
You know, we have a buddy
who is always on
the lookout for new talent.

42:43.478 --> 42:47.847
And the man is a genius.
He is the godfather
of entertainment.

42:47.982 --> 42:49.472
And he's having
auditions tomorrow.

42:49.817 --> 42:52.934
The Hoff?
You mean he can help me?

42:53.029 --> 42:54.269
If he like you.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.820
Wow. Thanks, Blind Boys.

42:57.158 --> 42:58.694
Good Iuck, Iittle rabbit.

42:59.660 --> 43:02.117
Wait,
how did you know I was...

43:02.455 --> 43:03.490
Mmm!

43:03.664 --> 43:05.120
CIever gents.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.120
E.B.:
So, Fred, how'd it go?

43:08.211 --> 43:09.826
FRED:
Don't say a word.

43:11.339 --> 43:12.374
(GRUNTING)

43:19.222 --> 43:20.883
FRED: Can I get a Iittle
clarification, here?

43:21.015 --> 43:22.471
Is this what
the Easter Bunny does now?

43:22.558 --> 43:24.674
He just goes house to house,
messing up people's Iives?

43:24.811 --> 43:26.347
Well, that
is just hurtful.

43:26.479 --> 43:28.686
Besides, you're
selling yourself short.

43:28.815 --> 43:30.976
They were going to
shove you in the mail room.

43:31.067 --> 43:33.228
Well, excuse me,
but I happen to think
you're better than that.

43:33.361 --> 43:35.568
You don't know me, okay?
We just met.

43:35.696 --> 43:39.735
I can tell.
You give off this aura
of untapped potential.

43:40.701 --> 43:41.816
I do?

43:42.328 --> 43:45.035
Don't pull that
with me, rabbit, okay?
I'm too smart for you.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.779
But, Fred, I'm serious.

43:46.874 --> 43:49.536
You're destined to
do something great.
I just know it.

43:49.877 --> 43:50.912
I've heard rhat one before.

43:51.045 --> 43:53.081
You'll find an awesome job.

43:53.214 --> 43:55.375
Hey. Look, what about this?

43:55.716 --> 43:57.172
Dog walker?
No.

43:57.385 --> 43:58.875
TSA Officer?.
No.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.461
What about this one?
It looks exciting.

44:01.556 --> 44:04.343
Wind in your hair,
hot babe on your arm.

44:04.725 --> 44:06.181
That's a car ad.

44:06.394 --> 44:08.726
You should buy that car, then.

44:11.858 --> 44:12.893
(SIGHING)

44:14.569 --> 44:15.604
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

44:16.571 --> 44:19.233
Ah! Señor.
How you doing, jefe?.

44:20.199 --> 44:21.564
Am I disturbing?

44:22.910 --> 44:25.401
It's never been
this quiet in here.

44:25.746 --> 44:27.156
Yeah, it's so depressing.

44:27.248 --> 44:30.285
You should clear this out.
Make a new den or a clubhouse.

44:30.418 --> 44:33.080
Like a man-cave!
It'll be fun.

44:33.462 --> 44:36.078
I called his
dreams ridiculous.

44:36.966 --> 44:38.422
What kind of
father does that?.

44:38.551 --> 44:39.791
No, no, señor.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.464
I will not permit you
to beat yourself up over this.

44:42.597 --> 44:45.589
Anybody would be lucky
to have a father such as you.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.973
Thank you, Carlos.
I miss him.

44:48.102 --> 44:49.467
Me, too, señor.

44:49.604 --> 44:52.220
A son is very
difficult to replace.

44:53.441 --> 44:56.604
Difficult, but
not impossible.

44:58.779 --> 44:59.985
Carlos...

45:00.156 --> 45:02.147
What the...
What's that on your head?

45:02.450 --> 45:04.441
What?. My new earmuffs?

45:04.785 --> 45:07.777
It's a cold spring
this year, you know? Brr!

45:08.623 --> 45:09.658
Oh.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.781
Anyway, what am I going to do?

45:11.918 --> 45:13.624
I know,
how can you deliver Easter

45:13.753 --> 45:16.745
with this tremendous burden
on your old, frail shoulders?.

45:16.839 --> 45:18.830
Hey, hey,
hey, easy
with the "old."

45:18.966 --> 45:20.957
No, I'm just saying,
like, compared to me.

45:21.135 --> 45:23.751
Surely you're not thinking
of making the trip yourself?

45:23.846 --> 45:24.881
What choice
do we have?

45:24.972 --> 45:27.008
We can improvise. I mean...

45:27.642 --> 45:31.260
Does it even
have to be a bunny?
Whar?

45:31.354 --> 45:34.517
I suppose,
given these troubled times,

45:34.982 --> 45:38.270
even a humble
chick could do the job.

45:39.695 --> 45:40.775
(LAUGHING)

45:41.489 --> 45:42.649
Really, Carlos.

45:42.990 --> 45:44.446
(LAUGHING AWKWARDLY)

45:44.617 --> 45:46.983
Wow. I mean,
that is funny.

45:47.161 --> 45:49.322
Can you imagine that?.
A chick delivering Easter?

45:49.497 --> 45:50.657
That's ridiculous.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.238
Oh, dear me.

45:52.333 --> 45:54.745
But I appreciare
you trying to
cheer me up, though.

45:54.835 --> 45:57.793
Please. It is my pleasure
to amuse you, señor.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.962
(LAUGHING)
A chick delivering...

46:09.308 --> 46:11.674
Fred, I was wondering if...

46:11.811 --> 46:13.551
Are you doing
anything tomorrow?

46:14.188 --> 46:16.725
Tomorrow I get to
start my new job
at the video game company.

46:17.149 --> 46:19.515
Wait a second.
No, that didn't work out.

46:19.652 --> 46:21.688
I know. I know.
I'm sorry about that.

46:21.862 --> 46:25.195
But do you know whar?
Every cloud has
a silver Iining.

46:25.324 --> 46:28.691
And behold this
silver lining, Fred!

46:31.914 --> 46:32.949
The Hoff?

46:33.040 --> 46:34.746
Yes, please.
I just need a ride.

46:34.875 --> 46:35.864
Mmm.

46:36.043 --> 46:37.579
No.
Come on, Fred.

46:37.712 --> 46:40.704
This iS my one big chance.
I'll do anything.

46:41.382 --> 46:43.373
Even get out of your life.

46:47.221 --> 46:50.713
I take you to
Hoff Knows Talent,
and that's it, we're done.

46:50.850 --> 46:52.590
Bunny's honor.
(SPITS)

46:52.727 --> 46:53.762
Right here, mate.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.634
It's okay.
A verbal agreement is fine.

46:55.730 --> 46:57.641
Now, you realize,
you can't talk.

46:57.732 --> 46:59.222
No. I can.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.433
No, what I mean is,
you shouldn't talk.

47:02.570 --> 47:04.106
What? Like, ever?

47:04.238 --> 47:05.444
Yeah,
"ever" would be wonderful.

47:05.573 --> 47:07.564
But from now on,
especially not in
front of other people.

47:07.867 --> 47:09.778
They might freak out
and want to
dissect your brain.

47:09.910 --> 47:11.775
Dissect? That's
a bit extreme.

47:11.912 --> 47:13.948
There's an easy explanation
as to why I can talk.

47:14.081 --> 47:15.867
It's a simple combination
of cuteness and magic.

47:15.958 --> 47:18.370
Okay. Here we go. One BLT.

47:18.461 --> 47:22.329
And one order of
carrot cake a Ia mode,
topped with, quote,

47:22.423 --> 47:25.415
Whatever candy you have
Iaying around back there.
Unquote.

47:25.593 --> 47:26.958
Uh, excuse me.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.134
Is that a cough drop?

47:29.263 --> 47:32.426
Yeah. It's cherry.
It counts.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.465
It's a peculiar garnish.

47:34.602 --> 47:36.308
Can I get some
chocolate syrup?

47:37.313 --> 47:38.723
Sure, doll.

47:39.315 --> 47:40.771
E.B.:
Thanks, Iove.

47:42.651 --> 47:45.609
It seems my brain is
still intact, Fred.

47:46.989 --> 47:48.820
E.B.: Fred,
I've just had an idea.

47:48.949 --> 47:52.362
When I'm a famous rock srar,
I'm going to buy
a mansion just Iike this

47:52.453 --> 47:55.786
and make you
sleep in the garage
in a topsy-turvy switcheroo.

47:55.873 --> 47:58.615
What do you think?
Oh, man. My sister is here.

47:58.793 --> 48:00.124
You never told me
you had a sister.

48:00.461 --> 48:02.918
There's still so much
we don't know
about each other, Fred.

48:03.005 --> 48:04.586
If she goes upstairs,
I'm dead.

48:04.673 --> 48:05.958
Why?
Why?.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.130
Let me take you
back to this morning

48:07.218 --> 48:08.958
when you flooded
the bathroom and
you trashed the bedroom.

48:09.053 --> 48:10.088
You remember thar?

48:10.179 --> 48:13.171
Fred, leave this to me.
I'll smooth ir out with her.
Ow!

48:13.307 --> 48:15.298
Hey!
Look at me.

48:16.977 --> 48:19.309
One word out of you,
and it's rabbit season.
You got it?

48:20.648 --> 48:22.309
Okay, I'm going to
run interference.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.231
I need you to sneak upstairs
and clean up, quietly!

48:27.696 --> 48:28.731
(DOOR CLOSES)

48:29.073 --> 48:30.153
Sam!
Hi!

48:30.241 --> 48:33.233
Hey, it's not a good
time for me right now.
I was just Ieaving.

48:33.327 --> 48:34.658
But you just got here.

48:35.413 --> 48:36.823
I know, right?

48:38.082 --> 48:39.868
Hey, what are these?
Oh!

48:40.334 --> 48:42.996
There you are.
(CHUCKLES) Mmm!

48:43.212 --> 48:45.123
I'm on this North Beach diet.
It's carrots only.

48:45.214 --> 48:46.829
That is why rhey're
all over the house.

48:47.007 --> 48:48.668
I was going to
clean them up, though.

48:49.009 --> 48:51.500
Okay, Fred,
how did the interview go?
Yes?.

48:51.595 --> 48:54.086
Oh! Thank you for asking.
Amazing! I aced it.

48:54.181 --> 48:55.216
Really?
Yeah.

48:55.349 --> 48:56.384
No way!

48:56.517 --> 48:57.848
Why are you so surprised?

48:57.935 --> 48:59.891
Fred, that's awesome!
PIace could use me, too.

49:00.020 --> 49:02.853
Don't get me wrong,
it was great.
It was good.

49:03.357 --> 49:04.392
It was all right.

49:04.525 --> 49:07.813
I just... I don't know
if it was for me, really.
It just didn't gel.

49:07.903 --> 49:10.565
Something felt a Iittle off
about the whole thing.

49:10.656 --> 49:12.021
I didn't get it.

49:12.491 --> 49:14.447
Oh! What? What happened?

49:14.535 --> 49:18.119
It's kind of hard ro pinpoint
any one specific thing.

49:18.414 --> 49:20.075
Oh, Fred.

49:20.207 --> 49:22.664
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

49:23.711 --> 49:25.042
(WHIRRING)

49:26.672 --> 49:27.752
What is thar?

49:28.257 --> 49:30.999
I wouldn't know
because I'm not
allowed to go up there.

49:31.093 --> 49:33.459
And I haven't
been up there once.

49:33.888 --> 49:35.674
Hmm. Okay.

49:37.057 --> 49:40.424
Sam, no, you're not
allowed up there, either.
Don't go up there!

49:40.936 --> 49:42.472
Sam, I'm begging you!

49:42.938 --> 49:44.599
I can explain.

49:46.108 --> 49:50.147
(GASPS)
Oh, my God!
Look at this.

49:57.995 --> 49:59.735
(EXCLAIMING)

50:00.956 --> 50:04.289
Look how cute this
stuffed bunny is!

50:04.543 --> 50:07.535
Wow! Yeah. Oh.

50:08.005 --> 50:09.495
So cute!
Isn't he?

50:09.590 --> 50:11.376
Yeah, you know whar?
Maybe we shouldn't
be playing with him

50:11.467 --> 50:14.049
because we're not really
supposed to be up here in
the first place. So...

50:14.136 --> 50:15.922
He's just so lifelike.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.344
You think?

50:17.431 --> 50:18.841
It's a little
freaky-Iooking to me.

50:21.143 --> 50:24.260
Oh! Oh, he's so soft!
(MOUTHING)

50:24.563 --> 50:27.270
And cute, and cuddly,

50:29.026 --> 50:31.142
and warm.

50:31.403 --> 50:32.643
Okay!

50:32.738 --> 50:35.104
Why don't we put him back
before things
get uncomfortable?.

50:35.199 --> 50:36.735
No, I'm not uncomfortable.

50:36.825 --> 50:38.941
Well, I'm
uncomfortable because
I'm Iooking after the house

50:39.078 --> 50:40.864
and it's my responsibility.

50:42.998 --> 50:44.488
There we are.

50:44.667 --> 50:45.998
All right.
(E.B. IMITATING WIND-UP TOY)

50:46.293 --> 50:47.658
Oh, my God!

50:49.838 --> 50:52.796
Wow! Look at that.
He's a wind-up toy.

50:52.883 --> 50:54.999
That is so adorable!

50:55.094 --> 50:57.085
Yeah, I think
he might be broken.

50:57.179 --> 50:59.716
Yeah, you're a broken
little guy, aren't you?

51:07.398 --> 51:08.433
Hey... Ow!

51:09.817 --> 51:10.852
(SIGHS)

51:10.985 --> 51:13.692
Fred, I am really
worried about you.

51:14.196 --> 51:15.231
Hmm!

51:16.407 --> 51:17.897
Don't eat that.

51:18.409 --> 51:20.240
You might not like the flavor.

51:20.578 --> 51:21.943
Fred, relax.

51:25.249 --> 51:26.284
Watermelon.

51:27.585 --> 51:28.620
Can we go?

51:29.044 --> 51:32.161
Look, Sam, I don't
want you to worry, okay?.
I'II get something.

51:32.256 --> 51:34.918
Look, Fred,
I just thought it would make
tomorrow night a Iot easier

51:35.009 --> 51:37.375
if you could tell Mom and Dad
that you had a job.

51:37.469 --> 51:39.505
Whoa! What's
tomorrow night?

51:39.597 --> 51:41.929
Alex's play!
The one she's been
talking about for weeks.

51:42.016 --> 51:43.381
Oh, that is easy.
I'm not going.

51:43.475 --> 51:46.308
Oh, yeah, you are.
Fred, come on,
she's your sister.

51:46.478 --> 51:47.684
All right.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.386
Wear something nice.
I'II wear something nice.

51:49.481 --> 51:50.561
7:00.
7::00.

51:50.649 --> 51:51.684
Don't forget, I love you.
I Iove you.

51:51.775 --> 51:53.640
Put gas in your car. 7::00.
Bye.

51:54.945 --> 51:57.357
Nice. Is she
seeing anyone?

51:58.532 --> 52:00.818
No, she's single,
and she's looking
for a rabbit.

52:16.550 --> 52:17.630
(SNARLING)

52:21.555 --> 52:24.513
Wow! There's a lot
of people here, Fred.

52:25.225 --> 52:27.056
Way more than I imagined.

52:27.186 --> 52:28.221
You nervous?

52:28.479 --> 52:29.969
Well, a little.

52:30.064 --> 52:31.224
It's just...

52:31.357 --> 52:33.973

you tell me you
want to see other rabbits?

open-minded, Fred.

E.B., I have
the most amazing idea.

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:09.858

I told everyone

that I saw
the Easter Bunny, right?

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:13.028

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.530
even though

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:18.371
he left me this.

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:22.211

which I kept.

I realized that it was
my destiny to see him.

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:34.554
Just like it was my
destiny to meet you.

01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:36.642
It's all been
leading up to this.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:37.765
Up to what?

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:39.934
You don't want to be
the Easter Bunny, right?

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:41.556
I know who can
take your place.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:42.724

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:44.730
Me!

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.898
I'm sorry, Fred.
Would you mind repeating
that in my good ear?

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.196
I want to be the Easter Bunny.

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:55.828

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:02.206
Come on, Fred!
It doesn't make sense.

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:04.583
A bunny makes no sense.
You deliver eggs.

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:06.964
If you wanna get all logical,
bring logic into this,

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:08.128
you should be
an Easter Chicken.

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:09.376
What? Come on.

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:12.466
People might resist it
at first. But, hey,
change can be a good thing.

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:15.386
You don't want the job anyway.
The pressure is ungodly!

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:16.887
It did a number on me.

01:04:16.978 --> 01:04:18.843
Do you know there was
a period of roughly
nine months

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:21.145
where rhe sight
of a colored egg
made me want to vomit?.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.185
And rabbits are
physically unable to vomit.

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:26.234
So it was just hours of...
(RETCHING)

01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:27.481
Nothing coming out.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.938
I don't care.
Imagine that, Fred.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.113
Don't care.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.408
If you can be a drummer,
I can be the Easter Bunny.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:36.282
Fred, you can't just
be the Easter Bunny.

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:39.163
My dad has to give
you special powers.
Eh.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.658
Besides, rhe Easrer
Bunny has got to be fit.
Ow!

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:43.501
And you're a little scrawny.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.211
Finally, the Easter Bunny
has got to have

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:46.754
Iightning-fast reflexes.
Hi-ya!

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:50.129
Knock it off.
I'm serious.
I can do this.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:52.544
I will be the Bunny.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:05:00.268
The stubborn old bunny
refuses to crown anyone else.

01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:03.472
This can only mean
one thing, my friends.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:07.025
We are going to
have to take matters
into our own hands.

Yes, Phil?

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.322
(STAMMERING)
We don't have hands, per se.

01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:16.367
No, it's a figure
of speech, Phil.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:17.485
Right. Got it.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.788
Too long have we labored
under the yoke of
the bunnies' tyranny.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.490
Well, no more!

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:25.952
It's time for
the Easter Chick to rise!

Just thinking out loud.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.252
But wouldn'r ir be
easier just to wait for E.B.?
I mean, he can fix this.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:36.963
Phil, if you love
E.B. so much,
why don't you marry him?

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:38.423
E.B. is gone, okay?
Oh.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:39.883
There is a new boss.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:42.101

Is it me?.

Just rehearsing
for the big

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.899
Okay, everybody,
this time sing
a lot more better.

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:55.023
And one, and two.
And three and four.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:57.359
It's me.
Me, you idiot.
I'm taking over.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:58.739
Oh. I see.

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:01.033
But first,
I must get in shape.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.080
I will be the Bunny.

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:12.875
You know,
I've been thinking, Fred.

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:14.254
Oh!

01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:16.544
Hey, E.B., what's up?

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:20.886
Fred, listen.
You helped me
become a drummer.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.800
And how do I repay you?

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:26.764
I jellybean all over
your dream. Well, no. No.

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:29.398
I've changed me mind.
I've seen the light.

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:31.567
We're going to do this.

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:33.691
And nice job on the eggs.

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:36.523
I told you I was serious.

Conditioning is a must, Fred.

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:42.366
Seventy-three.

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:46.157
This is fun.
Just a couple of dudes
hanging out, getting buff.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:47.492
I could do this
all day!

01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:49.578

I feel great.

For a couple of seconds,
you touched greatness.

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:19.399

look from back there?

they are pretty firm, yeah?

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:15.170
"Eb"?

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:16.797
It's "E.B." That's me.

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:20.805
Oh, all right, well, E.B.,
you're wanted on
stage in two minutes.

01:15:23.144 --> 01:15:25.100
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.939
Welcome to Hoff Knows Talent.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:38.319
You guss look great.
There are all kinds of
exciting acts tonight.

01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:39.982
HASSELHOFF:
There he is.

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:42.826
How's my little guy?

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:46.743
Acrually, David Hasselhoff,
I've got a problem.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:47.869
Hmm.

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:56.089
Is it the jitters?

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:59.761
Believe me,
even I used to get them.
Now, I find a good way...

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:01.678
No, ir's not
the jitters, David.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:05.345
I'm starting to realize
I might be
a really selfish rabbit.

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:06.843
Look, I love drumming.

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:08.560
But when my
friend needed me most,

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:12.014
I lefr him in a house
full of highly
trained ninja bunnies.

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:13.641
What am I going to do?

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:15.476
Hmm.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:18.275
A dilemma as old
as time itself.

01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:20.902
I know rhat if
I Ieft right now,
I'd be giving up fame.

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:22.949
And untold riches.
And untold riches.

01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:24.652
And all the bunnies
you could ever want.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:25.827
Yes, and all the...

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.997
You're not really
helping much, David.

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.665
Like, at all!

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:32.331
And Fred could be
in real trouble.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.171
Go to him.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:43.174
Go to him.

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:45.381
ANNOUNCER:
Give it up for
Mt. David Hasselhoff!

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.508
It's The Hoff!

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:54.686
Fred?

01:16:56.195 --> 01:16:57.685
Anybody home?

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:00.191
Fred?

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.206
Uh-oh.

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:18.373
CARLOS: The Easter moon
is on the rise.

01:17:18.717 --> 01:17:19.832
At midnight,

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:24.842
her radiant beams
will fill up the Egg
of Destiny with magic.

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:27.924
Then, at Iast, Señor Bunny,

01:17:28.018 --> 01:17:30.760
I will be Easter's new king!

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:32.470
Carlos, I'm
warning you!

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:35.853
The Egg of Destiny
is too dangerous in
the hands of a chick.

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:38.355
Its power can only
be wielded by a bunny.

01:17:38.445 --> 01:17:41.357
Oh, yes?.
Well, Iool at me wielding.
I'm wielding!

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:43.814
Ooh-ooh. I'm wielding
it again. Okay?

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:47.197
Oh, Carlos, can I wield
the Egg of Destiny?. PIease?

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:48.323
No.

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:49.574
Can I at least touch it?

01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:51.580
Ow!
There, you touched it.

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:52.827
That was harsh.

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:54.579
But, Carlos,
rhink of the children.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.501
Yes, but I am! The childrens.

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:59.001
They don't want
candy and chocolate.

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:00.331
From now on,

01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:04.840
their baskets will be filled
with clumps of bird seed,
dried crickets,

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:07.717
and the world's finest worms!

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:11.092
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:12.680
ALL: Mmm!

01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:15.304
Have you
completely Iost your mind?

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:18.266
Silence! You see,
this is why he must go.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.524
It's this lousy attitude
of his. Well, no more!

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:27.237
The more sensitive
chicks in the room
may want to avert their eyes.

01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:29.364
What about
a compromise, okay?

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:32.197
The bunny gers Easter
one year and the chick
gets it the next.

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:33.827
Enough of the chitty-chatty.

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:36.625
Bye-bye, Easter Bunny.

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:38.290
Hello! Hey, everyone.

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:41.880
I'm back. Yep,
ir was all a big mistake,
but I'm alive.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:44.458
Hey, Larry, Kyle,
what are you doing in there?

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.760
E.B.'S DAD:
E.B.! You're alive!

01:18:46.847 --> 01:18:48.087
E.B.!

01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:51.140
Dad? Fred? What's going on?

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:54.893
Gummy cannons! In position.
Fire at will!

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:57.308
(E.B. SCREAMING)

01:18:58.192 --> 01:18:59.307
That hurt!

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:00.937
Put him on the belt, boys.

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:04.646
Dice him, slice him,
and pulverize him!
(LAUGHING OMINOUSLY)

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.321
That is a bit excessive.

01:19:07.326 --> 01:19:09.533
Oh, no! E.B.!
Son!

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:12.282
The reign of
the bunny is over!

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:14.909
Oh!

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.499
Somebody help!
Help us!

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:21.371
What are you doing?
Don't worry, Dad, Fred.
I'II be right there.

01:19:22.049 --> 01:19:24.040
To the Egg SIeigh!
And step on it!

01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:30.883
(SNIFFING)

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:33.265
Are these ropes made
of black Iiquorice?

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:35.885
Yes, yes, rhey are.
Horrible stuff!

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.060
We can eat through them.

01:19:37.231 --> 01:19:39.392
(GROANS IN DISGUST)
I suppose you can.

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:50.241
You see, my friends?
It is just Iike
I told you, no?.

01:19:50.327 --> 01:19:53.444
Oh, tonight is going to
be a very big night!

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:57.324
(EXCLAIMING)
I'm flying!

01:19:57.418 --> 01:20:00.626
Wirhout even
flapping my tiny wings.

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:03.709
Everything is
coming up Carlos!

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:04.959
(LAUGHING)

01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:10.385
Got it!
Good man, Fred.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:13.047
Hop on.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:14.427
All right. Let's go!

01:20:14.852 --> 01:20:18.720
I'm starting to get a sense
of impending doom now.

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:21.013
Ow! (GASPS)

01:20:24.862 --> 01:20:25.942

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:50.838
I made it!

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:53.762
All right. Here we go!
Come on, Fred!

01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:54.926
FRED: Whoa!

01:20:56.435 --> 01:20:59.142
Look, Fred!
There he is. It's E.B.!
E.B.!

01:20:59.229 --> 01:21:01.595
The Egg SIeigh!
You've got to stop Carlos!

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.226
Don't worry, Dad!
I'm on it!

01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:08.272
(LAUGHING)

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:10.942
The power is
surging through my veins!

01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:12.068
(LAUGHS)

01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:14.657

Come on out, Carlos.
It ends here!

01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:43.895
You think you can
just take over Easter?

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:45.597
Well, guess what?

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:48.650
(LAUGHING OMINOUSLY)

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:51.858
I actually think
you're on to something.

01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:54.068
You're a bright man,
you're an innovator.

01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:56.484

I'm so sorry for
all the things I said.

But, E.B.,
what about your dream?

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:44.294
I'm still going to
be a drummer, Dad.

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:46.425
But I can be
the Easter Bunny, too.

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:48.389
There's just one thing.

Please step forward.

01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:05.156
Down on one knee.

01:26:05.243 --> 01:26:06.983
Left or right,
doesn't matter.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:12.497
And now, place your forefinger
on the Egg of Destiny.

01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:14.328
Oh...

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:21.923
E.B., you as well.

01:26:23.136 --> 01:26:24.922
By the power vested in me,

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:27.925
I pronounce E.B.
and Fred O'Hare

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:30.261
co-Easter Bunnies.

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:31.967
Hear, hear!

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.189
(CHEERING)

01:26:41.279 --> 01:26:45.022
Now go forth and deliver!

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:46.439
Woohoo!

01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:50.618
(FRED WHOOPING)

01:27:03.301 --> 01:27:04.336
Wonderful brunch, Bonnie.

01:27:04.511 --> 01:27:05.546
Thank you, dear.

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:07.218
It is delicious.

01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:10.635
Torally agree.
This is amazing, Mom.

01:27:11.184 --> 01:27:13.470
You should open a restaurant.
I'm serious.

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:16.770
That is a very nice
thing to say, Fred.

01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:20.020
And can I say that
I love your costume?

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:22.233
I think it is so cheerful.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.685
Thanks, Mom.

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:25.190

(SIGHS)

01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:34.411
I'm so tired.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:36.531
Yeah, you were up very late
delivering pizzas.

01:27:37.711 --> 01:27:39.121
Easter baskers.

01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:41.874
Every time you say
'"Easter baskets,"
I hear "pizza."

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:43.338
It just helps me cope.

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:45.256

This is exciting.

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:52.802
That is my
co-Easter Bunny.

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:55.555
Hey, why don'r you
guys come see me off?
It'll be fun.

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:04.146
Well, that's weird.
Who do you think it is?

01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:06.027
I don't know.

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:16.912
Wow.

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:19.119

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:32.137

01:28:32.599 --> 01:28:34.260
It's pretty cool, huh?

01:28:35.852 --> 01:28:38.013
(SIGHS) I'm sorry I gave
you such a hard time.

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:39.515

You don't have to...

The one who
makes it all happen.

01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:07.331
Say the words, Fred.
Bring it home.

01:29:07.425 --> 01:29:12.010
Happy Easter ro all!
And to all,
a good mid-to-Iate morning.

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:21.015

E.B.: Yeah, come on, Carlos.
Put your back into it.

01:29:28.405 --> 01:29:32.193
I've been flapping all night,
so just cut me
some slacks, okay?

01:29:33.076 --> 01:29:36.318
One Iittle coup
and suddenly I'm
everybody's chump.

(BOTH SPEAKING MANDARIN)

01:34:48.057 --> 01:34:50.093
Fred, whar did she say?
Was that about me?.

01:34:50.226 --> 01:34:51.261
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:57.723
You speak Chinese?
Just when I think I
can't Iove you any more...
