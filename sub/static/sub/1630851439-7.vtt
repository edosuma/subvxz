WEBVTT

01:37.472 --> 01:41.602
The Anthor Belt.
Dad used to tell me stories about it.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.479
Wonder what he'd say now.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.660
Would you believe
I used to work on one of those things?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.955
Mining palladium. I remember.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.416
My back's sore
just looking at all that equipment.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.878
I can't believe it's still there.
Your people, they just left it?

02:08.961 --> 02:12.090
Without the Empire's tech,
the industry just broke down.

02:12.966 --> 02:17.137
That's when I started doing
long-haul routes. Another life.

02:22.309 --> 02:25.354
In other words,
you abandoned your own people.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.190
Meant there was one less Thespin
to fight over the scraps.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.567
Approaching coordinates.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.121
There's nothing here.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.958
Look closer, Warden.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.631
The Invictus?

02:57.094 --> 02:59.471
The crown jewel
of Emperor Taurelian's fleet.

02:59.555 --> 03:00.889
You know of her?

03:00.973 --> 03:05.227
They say, in her day, the Invictus
was the most powerful weapons platform

03:05.310 --> 03:07.271
the Empire had ever built.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.814
A world-killer.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.613
Yeah, she disappeared without a trace
700 years ago.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.449
No debris. No distress signals.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.661
People reported sightings of her
all across the galaxy,

03:22.744 --> 03:26.039
never responding to hails,
never seen in the same place twice.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.584
And you just found her here.

03:29.501 --> 03:30.961
Like she was calling to me.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.713
The Invictus is a jumpship.

03:32.796 --> 03:36.466
The Empire considers jump technology
a state secret.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.803
They'd sooner wipe out
the entire Outer Reach

03:39.887 --> 03:41.096
than allow you to take this ship.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.639
Nobody knows she's here.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.933
You won't even be able to board.

03:45.017 --> 03:47.895
The air lock will never open
for an Anacreon.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.820
Your imperial nanobots,

03:56.904 --> 03:59.364
programmed for
expedited healing and identification…

04:01.116 --> 04:03.869
coded to access any imperial ship.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.497
That's why we needed you, Commander.

04:08.457 --> 04:09.958
You're our way in.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.838
Even if that actually works,
you don't know where this ship has been

04:14.922 --> 04:16.632
or what happened to the crew.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.593
How do you even know
if she's safe to approach?

04:20.886 --> 04:22.053
She isn't.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.855
The two craft we lost attempting to board.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.108
Her defense systems are still active.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.277
Get the suits ready.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.071
It's time.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.423
Do you think any of those mining bases
still have active comms?

04:59.049 --> 05:01.051
It's unlikely. But it's possible.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.221
I've got a distress beacon.

05:06.223 --> 05:10.227
It's a neural implant,
records everything I see and hear.

05:10.310 --> 05:14.815
If we can get to a dispatch capsule
on the Invictus, we can send out a signal.

05:21.363 --> 05:24.616
All right, listen.
It's a 10,000-meter jump.

05:24.700 --> 05:29.288
You want to drop fast, with as little
extraneous movement as possible.

05:29.371 --> 05:33.166
On your final approach,
you'll have to flip over and brake.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.460
The Invictus's automated rail guns

05:35.544 --> 05:38.672
are blind to objects
under two meters in diameter.

05:38.755 --> 05:43.093
If we spread out and move with control,
we should be invisible to them.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.678
You know what you're doing?

05:46.180 --> 05:47.181
Almost never, lover.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.057
Warden, up front.

05:49.141 --> 05:52.144
You must land
on the inner ring to access the air lock.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.354
Miss the inner ring and you will be lost.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.491
I'll go on three.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.661
One. Two--

06:17.503 --> 06:18.754
Shit.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.057
Almost there.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.758
Good job, Warden.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.220
Sal, my suit's failing. It's no good.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.888
Thrusters aren't responding.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.349
No, no, no.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.309
-I can't-- I can't get it--
-I got you!

07:14.393 --> 07:17.396
-Sal! No, get back.
-Hugo! No. No.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.480
Get back.

07:22.317 --> 07:25.153
-Sal. Sal--
-Hugo!

07:25.237 --> 07:27.656
No. No. Hugo.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.713
Swallow your grief, Warden.
We have no time for it now.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.217
Air lock's that way. Let's move.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.027
Excuse me, Empire.

08:05.110 --> 08:08.864
I know you're far too rational
to have taken what I did as any sort of--

08:08.947 --> 08:12.242
Go on. I'm curious to hear
just what you think you didn't do.

08:12.326 --> 08:16.455
If I hadn't knelt, it would've been
a clear contradiction of my faith.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.208
So you knelt before a demagogue.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.794
-I was kneeling to the Mother.
-I'm sorry, to the what?

08:22.878 --> 08:25.297
I'm not familiar with that term,

08:25.380 --> 08:27.382
motherless atrocity that I am.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.552
You know I don't agree
with Halima's position.

08:30.636 --> 08:35.682
I should hope not. You're not precisely
one with the reincarnation cycle yourself.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.394
I wonder what Halima would say
if she were made aware of that.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.563
It's not in my interest
to publicize your true nature.

08:42.648 --> 08:45.859
This was a staggering betrayal, Demerzel.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.862
It was a betrayal of your directive.

08:48.946 --> 08:53.075
As far as I understood it,
you are incapable of disloyalty.

08:53.158 --> 08:56.036
Over all else,
your fealty to the Cleonic Dynasty

08:56.119 --> 08:57.955
is embedded into your programming.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.581
And that is precisely my point.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.543
If kneeling
were in violation of my protocol,

09:02.626 --> 09:05.212
I would not have been able to. Physically.

09:05.796 --> 09:09.550
The very signals I use to instruct
my limbs to bend would have been blocked.

09:10.926 --> 09:16.181
An explanation that also
conveniently justifies your actions.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.766
Here is my question,

09:18.433 --> 09:20.227
did you want to kneel?

09:21.436 --> 09:25.190
I am loyal to Empire above all else.

09:25.274 --> 09:27.150
-Forgive me, Empire--
-Spit it out.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.903
It seems Zephyr Halima's speech
has struck a chord.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.866
Ambassador Thanwall indicates that
she has now become the front-runner.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.827
Well then…

09:38.203 --> 09:42.082
we have to shift her away
from this pet subject.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.837
I've gotta figure out
what she actually wants from me.

10:32.674 --> 10:35.469
I wouldn't have expected
to see you down here, Cleon.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.096
The correct honorific is "Empire."

10:38.180 --> 10:41.808
I have great respect
for those who attempt the Spiral.

10:41.892 --> 10:45.604
A sacred ritual,
reserved for a proxima's passing.

10:46.730 --> 10:50.067
To walk is to humble oneself
before the Triple Goddesses.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.989
I see someone's coached you well.

10:57.074 --> 11:01.453
Tell me, Lady Demerzel,
have you had occasion to walk the Spiral?

11:01.537 --> 11:04.039
I have. Many years ago.

11:06.250 --> 11:09.878
Then you know just how transformative
the journey can be…

11:11.213 --> 11:14.216
and how the body will suffer.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.262
This man was blinded by the sun.

11:19.429 --> 11:23.183
Many others die attempting to reach
the Womb of the Mother.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.978
All very noble deaths, I'm sure.

11:26.061 --> 11:29.439
Zephyr Halima, Empire was hoping
to speak frankly with you.

11:30.274 --> 11:33.151
I can appreciate an aggressive early play.

11:33.235 --> 11:37.781
And, well, you've succeeded in
drawing me down here into the trenches.

11:37.865 --> 11:42.619
So, I applaud you. I'm here.
And I'm listening.

11:43.328 --> 11:46.331
I'm not really sure
what it is you're expecting me to say.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.083
What is your ask?

11:50.252 --> 11:52.546
End the Genetic Dynasty.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.507
If you're only fielding offers,
consider the following.

11:55.591 --> 11:57.509
In addition to the desalination system,

11:57.593 --> 12:00.220
we will also establish
a satellite security station

12:00.304 --> 12:02.264
for the dedicated protection
of your people.

12:02.347 --> 12:05.225
Safety and clean water.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.436
We're misunderstanding
each other here, Cleon.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.105
My ask is not a tactic.

12:10.189 --> 12:12.608
I only preach what I believe.

12:12.691 --> 12:16.445
And I believe the Genetic Dynasty
will be the ruin of us all.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.155
Luminists can see the future now?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.699
I do not claim to see the future.

12:20.782 --> 12:26.371
I only have a sense deep in my soul
of what is true and what is wrong.

12:26.455 --> 12:27.706
Wrong?

12:27.789 --> 12:31.752
You don't even remotely comprehend
what my familial line has accomplished.

12:31.835 --> 12:35.047
-My brothers and I--
-Brothers? You are not brothers.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.758
You are the reverberations
of a dead man's ego,

12:37.841 --> 12:40.844
by nature blind to all that you lack.

12:40.928 --> 12:44.056
The soulless creature
cannot recognize itself.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.435
I believe the late Dr. Seldon
made a similar observation?

12:50.646 --> 12:53.482
If that is truly what you believe,
I am sorry.

12:53.565 --> 12:56.610
You will spend your life
shouting into the void.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.029
The only reason you ventured down here

12:59.947 --> 13:03.534
is because you know
people are listening to me.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.161
I'm sure, in preparation for your visit,

13:06.245 --> 13:11.291
you were counseled as to the staggering
numbers of followers Luminism claims,

13:11.375 --> 13:16.380
all committed to acting
in service of truth's light.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.342
Remind me, how many people did it take
to bring down your Star Bridge?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.302
Are you threatening me?

13:22.386 --> 13:26.682
I'm only trying to answer your question,
to articulate my ask.

13:27.266 --> 13:30.769
I'm not surprised it's left you confused.

13:30.853 --> 13:33.647
It's about something
much greater than you.

13:33.730 --> 13:37.109
But I'm sure your adviser
will help you to understand.

13:37.192 --> 13:41.113
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have souls that need ministering to.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.889
-Lewis, fall back. Fall back, Lewis.
-What, Salvor?

14:06.972 --> 14:08.891
You and Jacenta are too close. Two meters!

14:08.974 --> 14:10.601
Oh, sorry.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.567
Take cover!

14:37.669 --> 14:40.714
If I open the doors, the guns will stop.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.508
Commander!

14:56.855 --> 14:58.190
Now!

15:06.448 --> 15:07.741
Come on.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.596
No!

15:33.934 --> 15:36.061
He served his purpose.

16:04.840 --> 16:08.594
Not you, Warden.
You're too dangerous unfettered.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.220
Hold out your hands.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.061
Now, move.

16:37.331 --> 16:38.707
Keep moving.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.627
Atmosphere's frozen.

16:42.127 --> 16:44.171
Must be a hull breach somewhere.

16:44.755 --> 16:49.426
The environmental systems must be off.
We should find a regulation panel.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.406
The regulation panel. Over here.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.093
Okay. The system's archaic.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.221
I'll have to input commands
with manual code.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.725
I've sealed the breach
so it's safe to restore atmosphere.

17:38.809 --> 17:39.893
Do it.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.232
We might have weather in here
as the atmosphere regulates.

17:46.817 --> 17:49.570
And now for the gravity. Heads up.

18:00.831 --> 18:04.668
Those lights, what was that?
Is that a power surge?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.086
I'm not sure.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.421
Now update security protocols.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.506
I want the internal defenses off-line.

18:09.590 --> 18:12.467
Security's a different system.
That'll be closer to the bridge.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.429
Then we head there next.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.071
Sixteen seconds.

18:34.406 --> 18:39.036
Hey, the lights were pulsating
consistently every 18 seconds,

18:39.119 --> 18:40.954
and now it's down to 16.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.915
Okay. So, what does that mean?

18:43.457 --> 18:46.418
-Like a countdown?
-A countdown to what?

18:50.172 --> 18:51.381
The next jump.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.929
Two weeks ago,
my people were out on a scavenging run.

18:57.763 --> 18:59.598
They happened to see the Invictus jump in.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.892
We think her drives
are cycling on their own,

19:01.975 --> 19:04.102
setting random time intervals
between jumps.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.231
We knew,
if we wanted to get control of the ship,

19:07.314 --> 19:10.150
we had to board
before she could jump away again.

19:10.234 --> 19:11.527
Jump away where?

19:14.696 --> 19:18.951
They have no idea.
That's how the legend started.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.161
That's why the Invictus
became a ghost ship.

19:23.413 --> 19:25.707
The crew must have lost control,

19:25.791 --> 19:30.254
and the ship started jumping from one
random set of coordinates to the next.

19:31.672 --> 19:35.133
They got marooned
out in the dark deep somewhere,

19:35.217 --> 19:36.802
out of comms range…

19:38.095 --> 19:40.222
maybe outside the galaxy completely.

19:41.682 --> 19:44.977
They ran out of food,
turned on each other.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.187
How long do we have
before the countdown gets to zero?

19:48.230 --> 19:49.857
At this rate…

19:50.732 --> 19:51.733
four hours.

19:52.484 --> 19:53.485
Okay.

19:54.778 --> 19:58.740
So we have four hours to get control,
or she blinks away again.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.926
You understand the urgency now.

20:18.802 --> 20:21.138
If we fail and we're lucky,

20:21.221 --> 20:23.098
we end up in the heart of a sun

20:24.683 --> 20:26.643
or staring down the mouth of a black hole.

20:27.311 --> 20:31.857
If we're unlucky,
we suffer much longer deaths.

20:36.612 --> 20:38.447
What are your feelings about Halima now?

20:40.282 --> 20:41.783
That was reckless.

20:42.743 --> 20:45.287
There's no question in my mind,
that was a threat.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.497
That damn Hari Seldon predicted this.

20:47.581 --> 20:51.543
"An exhortation from
one of the galaxy's major religions."

20:52.085 --> 20:56.131
As to Halima's threat, I will enhance
the security measures at the palace.

20:56.215 --> 20:59.009
We can assemble a comms team
to contain Halima's message,

20:59.092 --> 21:02.721
data filters triggered by certain phrases.
"Genetic Dynasty."

21:02.804 --> 21:03.805
No.

21:03.889 --> 21:06.975
I refuse to play defense with this woman.

21:08.101 --> 21:12.064
If she wants to invoke something
greater than me, I'll do the same.

21:13.315 --> 21:16.109
I'll prove both her and Seldon wrong.

21:23.742 --> 21:27.913
According to Zephyr Halima, I am soulless,

21:28.413 --> 21:31.124
and therefore incapable of growth.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.001
I disagree.

21:33.794 --> 21:37.756
But as she suggests, the soulless creature
cannot recognize itself,

21:38.465 --> 21:42.469
which is why I must appeal to those
with a much broader vantage,

21:43.220 --> 21:45.931
broader even than the zephyrs.

21:46.682 --> 21:51.144
I must appeal
to the Triple Goddesses themselves.

22:02.239 --> 22:04.741
I will walk the great Spiral.

22:05.534 --> 22:10.205
And I will let the Mother, the Maiden
and the Crone decide what is true,

22:11.456 --> 22:12.791
who is right…

22:15.878 --> 22:17.212
and who is wrong.

23:50.097 --> 23:51.223
How does this work?

23:51.306 --> 23:52.850
I'll show you.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.174
I've brought you something.

25:20.103 --> 25:21.647
Color-correction 'hesives.

25:21.730 --> 25:22.856
So you can see red and green.

25:25.317 --> 25:26.443
Thank you.

25:27.736 --> 25:31.907
But I can't. They'll draw attention.

25:32.658 --> 25:35.327
The others, Brother Dusk, Brother Day,

25:36.203 --> 25:37.204
they can't know.

25:37.788 --> 25:39.748
Maybe you could put them on
when they're not looking.

25:40.457 --> 25:42.084
They're always looking.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.546
And if they start pulling that thread,
it all comes undone.

25:48.173 --> 25:49.258
Yes, Empire.

25:50.050 --> 25:51.260
Please, Azura…

25:53.095 --> 25:54.221
call me Cleon.

25:56.598 --> 25:59.852
It's not just the color blindness.

26:00.435 --> 26:03.063
My thumbs clasp right over left.

26:04.481 --> 26:07.860
My brothers' clasp left over right.

26:08.569 --> 26:10.612
They love brassica.

26:11.822 --> 26:15.075
I find it so bitter
I can barely stomach it.

26:15.993 --> 26:17.953
I put my shoes on in a different order.

26:18.036 --> 26:20.414
I point at things
with a different crook in my finger.

26:20.497 --> 26:23.625
I eat starches before meats
instead of the other way round.

26:23.709 --> 26:27.379
If they notice the 'hesives,
they might notice all of it.

26:29.173 --> 26:30.632
Would that really be so terrible?

26:36.513 --> 26:37.890
I'll show you.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.364
This is the first.

26:54.448 --> 26:55.699
The Principium.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.911
The Cleon from whom we're all extracted.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.622
There's more.

27:12.633 --> 27:13.717
Are they alive?

27:15.219 --> 27:16.678
In a manner of speaking.

27:25.354 --> 27:26.855
They're absorbing information,

27:26.939 --> 27:29.191
so as to be up to date with our lives

27:29.274 --> 27:30.692
if they're ever needed.

27:31.235 --> 27:33.153
Needed? For what?

27:33.779 --> 27:39.660
If a Cleon is ever damaged or killed,
these are his replacements.

27:55.342 --> 27:57.928
Every moment of my life is a test.

27:59.513 --> 28:03.976
And if I ever fail,
if they ever learn how different I am,

28:05.435 --> 28:06.895
it'll be my last day.

28:09.356 --> 28:10.357
And his first.

28:11.275 --> 28:13.652
But they can't. You're Empire.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.028
No more than he is.

28:16.738 --> 28:20.868
My job, my reason for existing,
is to be a perfect copy.

28:20.951 --> 28:22.578
And if I can't do that, then--

28:26.665 --> 28:29.334
The Empire must be protected
from mistakes.

28:30.586 --> 28:31.670
Like me.

28:32.296 --> 28:34.548
So I can't take your gift, Azura.

28:34.631 --> 28:36.758
They can't know I'm correcting my sight.

28:38.010 --> 28:41.555
I have to blend in, or I die.

28:42.723 --> 28:45.559
Or you escape. You leave.

28:46.143 --> 28:48.937
They won't care.
They'll just wake up your replacement.

28:49.021 --> 28:51.648
They won't let a rogue Emperor go free.
They'll have me killed.

28:51.732 --> 28:54.276
Then we'll make it so they can't find you.

28:54.359 --> 28:56.820
I have the most recognizable face
in the galaxy.

28:56.904 --> 28:57.905
Not if we change it.

28:58.572 --> 29:00.032
There are biohackers underground.

29:00.115 --> 29:01.617
They could do it with a single incision.

29:02.951 --> 29:05.662
They'd still track me through my nanobots.

29:08.874 --> 29:11.126
There are people who can filter them out.

29:12.085 --> 29:14.588
You think you're the first person
who's wanted them gone?

29:20.427 --> 29:22.721
You showed me this place for a reason.

29:23.847 --> 29:26.266
The same reason
you jumped off your balcony.

29:27.142 --> 29:28.769
You can't live like this.

29:30.562 --> 29:33.732
You've lived every moment of your life
with people watching you.

29:34.942 --> 29:38.946
The Scar's different.
You can lose yourself in it.

29:40.405 --> 29:43.075
For Empire, the Scar represents a failure.

29:44.785 --> 29:47.746
For the rest of Trantor,
it represents an opportunity.

29:48.539 --> 29:54.711
For the first time in centuries, we can
look up and see real clouds, real stars,

29:55.587 --> 30:00.175
not a simulation run by servers
designed to keep us complacent.

30:03.303 --> 30:05.097
Will they let me through security with it?

30:05.180 --> 30:06.223
It's cloaked.

30:16.984 --> 30:19.278
It's nothing like your palace.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.448
It's crowded. It's chaotic.

30:24.366 --> 30:25.617
But it's alive.

30:27.703 --> 30:29.288
And it's waiting for you.

30:30.205 --> 30:31.665
Come with me.

30:42.551 --> 30:44.761
You missed the dinner bell.

30:45.554 --> 30:50.100
-Sorry.
-Punctuality. Routine. Respect.

30:51.226 --> 30:54.188
These may be practiced traits
to the everyman,

30:54.271 --> 30:57.316
but they are innate to a Cleon.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.109
At least, they should be.

30:59.193 --> 31:00.277
Of course.

31:01.153 --> 31:05.282
I was just learning about Trantor.
The rest of it.

31:05.866 --> 31:07.701
We are Trantor.

31:08.535 --> 31:11.788
Nothing outside the palace walls
is relevant.

31:27.054 --> 31:28.096
Hari?

31:30.682 --> 31:32.768
Computer, what am I looking at?

31:32.851 --> 31:35.479
Hari Seldon
Quantum Consciousness Protocol.

31:36.146 --> 31:37.898
It's a projection of some kind.

31:39.483 --> 31:42.444
Computer, identify the issue
with Hari Seldon Protocol.

31:42.528 --> 31:44.530
Incomplete neural uplink.

31:44.613 --> 31:45.822
Help me.

31:46.823 --> 31:48.784
Computer, what was the source of uplink?

31:48.867 --> 31:52.371
Initiated with
Raych Foss Arrival Protocol.

31:52.454 --> 31:53.455
Can you restart it?

31:53.539 --> 31:55.415
Authorization required.

31:56.333 --> 31:59.711
-Hari, can you hear me?
-Help me.

31:59.795 --> 32:04.550
Okay. Listen to me.
Focus on my voice. This is Gaal.

32:04.633 --> 32:06.093
Gaal!

32:06.176 --> 32:09.137
You've digitized your consciousness,
but something went wrong.

32:09.221 --> 32:12.140
You're glitching,
stuck in the loop of the past.

32:12.224 --> 32:13.809
Just concentrate on my voice.

32:14.518 --> 32:16.603
This is the present. This is now.

32:17.396 --> 32:19.690
That's it, Hari. Follow my voice.

32:19.773 --> 32:21.567
That is the past. This is now.

32:31.076 --> 32:32.619
What have you done to yourself, Hari?

32:33.203 --> 32:37.082
I had a data unit implanted in my brain
before we left Trantor…

32:38.625 --> 32:40.919
synced to a port hidden in Raych's knife.

32:41.003 --> 32:45.090
Recorded all my thoughts, memories,
everything, right up to the moment I--

32:47.009 --> 32:48.719
Something must've gone wrong.

32:50.012 --> 32:51.263
Where am I?

32:51.346 --> 32:54.683
On a ship called the Raven,
headed to Helicon,

32:54.766 --> 32:55.934
your homeworld, Hari.

32:56.018 --> 32:57.519
Helicon. Yes.

33:00.189 --> 33:01.190
How long?

33:03.692 --> 33:05.402
Thirty-four years.

33:09.406 --> 33:11.450
You're not supposed to be here.

33:12.743 --> 33:13.744
Where's Raych?

33:14.745 --> 33:16.371
He sent me instead.

33:16.455 --> 33:19.374
He wouldn't do that. You're supposed to
lead the First Foundation.

33:19.458 --> 33:20.626
He knew that.

33:21.168 --> 33:24.379
They'll be facing their first crisis soon.
Who's in charge?

33:24.463 --> 33:26.548
Lewis Pirenne, I'd imagine.

33:26.632 --> 33:28.634
He'll get them
through the settlement stage,

33:28.717 --> 33:31.094
but for what's coming next,
they'll need someone else, you.

33:31.178 --> 33:32.471
Raych knew that. Where's Raych?

33:33.555 --> 33:35.682
It's hard to explain.

33:37.726 --> 33:39.853
You're dead, Hari.

33:42.481 --> 33:43.649
You know that, right?

33:46.902 --> 33:48.237
Raych murdered you.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.404
They think I helped him.

33:50.614 --> 33:51.698
What? Why?

33:51.782 --> 33:55.285
I went to your cabin. Interrupted him.

33:56.161 --> 34:00.165
I saw him bent over you
with the knife in your chest.

34:00.749 --> 34:05.003
He threw me in the lifeboat
and stayed behind.

34:05.087 --> 34:06.338
What happened to him?

34:06.421 --> 34:07.798
They executed him.

34:08.841 --> 34:10.551
Raych is dead?

34:12.511 --> 34:13.846
Why, Hari?

34:15.514 --> 34:19.059
Hari? Why did he do it?

34:20.018 --> 34:21.061
Hari?

34:23.730 --> 34:25.148
Hari!

34:35.367 --> 34:38.704
We're running out of time.
We need to make a move. Now.

34:38.786 --> 34:41.290
We take their weapons,
level the playing field.

34:41.373 --> 34:43.750
I'm not a fighter. None of us are.

34:44.333 --> 34:47.588
Most people aren't, until they're left
with no other choice.

34:48.255 --> 34:49.297
Stop!

35:04.771 --> 35:06.148
An energy barrier.

35:08.567 --> 35:11.278
It's gotta be a tech precursor
to our fence on Terminus.

35:11.904 --> 35:14.573
I'm the only expert here
who can safely override it.

35:15.991 --> 35:17.659
But you'll need to uncuff me.

35:21.580 --> 35:23.207
Do it, Warden.

35:23.290 --> 35:24.625
Or we all die for nothing.

35:44.645 --> 35:47.564
That's it. We're all coded in.

36:08.919 --> 36:10.587
Fifteen seconds.

36:12.256 --> 36:14.716
Cuffs back on. Hold out your hands.

36:14.800 --> 36:15.968
What is this?

36:16.677 --> 36:20.180
The older ships used
cooling tanks for the jumpdrives. Careful.

36:20.973 --> 36:22.099
Stop stalling.

36:34.820 --> 36:36.488
Keep moving.

36:48.792 --> 36:49.960
Lewis!

37:12.357 --> 37:13.483
No! No!

37:29.124 --> 37:30.751
No, Phara.

37:30.834 --> 37:31.835
We still need her.

37:33.712 --> 37:37.382
There might be more barriers,
security protocols to override.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.475
Rowan, please.

37:47.267 --> 37:50.437
We're losing all our experts,
and we're running out of time.

37:50.521 --> 37:53.732
You wanna live to carry out
your strike against the Empire?

37:53.815 --> 37:55.901
You're not gonna do it
if you stay on board this ship.

37:55.984 --> 37:57.528
I'm never leaving the Invictus.

37:58.779 --> 38:00.197
And neither are you.

38:04.409 --> 38:07.663
You're gonna help us redirect the ship
before she jumps again.

38:07.746 --> 38:11.124
And then we'll guide it
right into the beating heart of Trantor.

38:13.919 --> 38:16.296
The Empire won't have a chance to run,

38:17.506 --> 38:19.299
just like my people did not.

38:21.176 --> 38:25.305
All of Trantor will be nothing
but a heap of poisonous ash,

38:25.389 --> 38:28.684
all its evils rendered silent
underneath it.

38:29.518 --> 38:32.104
We will deliver that justice to them,
Warden.

38:32.187 --> 38:37.484
We will die
to bring the Empire to its knees.

38:56.378 --> 38:58.380
Oxygen level at 2%.

38:59.047 --> 39:00.048
Hari?

39:01.133 --> 39:03.260
The ship's shut down without you.

39:04.636 --> 39:06.263
Temperature's dropped.

39:08.098 --> 39:10.350
I don't think I'll be able
to breathe much longer.

39:10.434 --> 39:13.645
Please authorize
reinstatement of life support systems.

39:18.442 --> 39:21.904
Please authorize
reinstatement of life support systems.

39:25.407 --> 39:26.408
Hari?

39:27.576 --> 39:29.745
-Please authorize reinstatement…
-Hari, please.

39:29.828 --> 39:32.289
-…of life support systems.
-Please, Hari. Please.

39:32.372 --> 39:33.749
Please. Please.

39:41.465 --> 39:43.217
Authorization complete.

40:03.028 --> 40:05.739
I owe you an explanation, Gaal.

40:05.822 --> 40:07.699
I recognize that now.

40:07.783 --> 40:09.284
Why did Raych do it?

40:09.368 --> 40:11.828
I don't understand. Why did he kill you?

40:12.412 --> 40:16.542
My death was an essential element
to the success of the Plan.

40:16.625 --> 40:18.210
Don't understand.

40:18.293 --> 40:21.797
The Foundation needs
more than a man to inspire it.

40:21.880 --> 40:25.050
It needs a myth
that can endure for centuries.

40:27.553 --> 40:29.096
And it worked.

40:29.179 --> 40:32.766
Do you remember what our mortality
projections had been for Terminus?

40:35.143 --> 40:37.437
34.2%.

40:37.521 --> 40:39.565
The actual rate was nearly half that.

40:40.357 --> 40:42.651
My death galvanized the Foundation.

40:42.734 --> 40:45.988
The Foundation isn't a religion, Hari.

40:46.572 --> 40:47.573
And you're not a god.

40:47.656 --> 40:50.617
No. Gods are impervious to knives.

40:51.577 --> 40:55.330
But you can kill them.
You just stop believing in them.

40:56.748 --> 41:00.377
I don't buy it.
I mean, you're egotistical,

41:00.460 --> 41:05.299
but I can't see you sacrificing your life
just to turn yourself into this.

41:05.382 --> 41:07.843
-Why not just wait until--
-I have Lethe Syndrome.

41:09.261 --> 41:11.346
Had Lethe Syndrome.

41:11.430 --> 41:12.973
Inherited from my father.

41:13.557 --> 41:17.311
Once the symptoms manifest,
the cognitive decline is steep.

41:17.394 --> 41:18.854
Think it through.

41:18.937 --> 41:21.273
We reach Terminus,
face famine and the elements,

41:21.356 --> 41:23.358
but I'm no longer
the hand of our salvation,

41:23.442 --> 41:26.361
but the crackpot who dragged
everyone to a frigid rock.

41:27.070 --> 41:29.990
But you told me it was your dream
to see Terminus.

41:30.073 --> 41:33.577
You said you wanted to
start the Foundation together.

41:34.161 --> 41:35.704
Yes.

41:35.787 --> 41:38.832
I said it loudly and often, didn't I?

41:38.916 --> 41:41.251
So often I started to bore myself.

41:42.336 --> 41:43.545
You were performing.

41:43.629 --> 41:46.006
I was engineering the narrative.

41:46.089 --> 41:48.091
That's a fancy way of saying you lied.

41:49.968 --> 41:51.595
Approaching debris disk.

42:01.438 --> 42:04.691
Helicon. Home.

42:06.485 --> 42:07.903
The debris field surrounds…

42:07.986 --> 42:09.696
Helicon's dark star.

42:10.697 --> 42:13.408
It's kept your homeworld hidden
all these years.

42:14.201 --> 42:19.081
I know where we are, Hari.
It's the why I'm struggling with.

42:20.332 --> 42:23.168
Did Raych know about this?
Your death? This ship?

42:23.252 --> 42:24.962
Raych knew everything.

42:26.046 --> 42:30.676
I was gonna take my life.
He was gonna stay behind to explain why…

42:31.260 --> 42:36.223
then, a week or so later,
disappear and reunite with me here.

42:38.934 --> 42:41.478
He loved you. That wasn't a lie.

42:43.814 --> 42:45.774
You should've warned me.

42:45.858 --> 42:47.109
Would you have listened?

42:47.860 --> 42:51.071
I am so tired of this.

42:51.989 --> 42:55.909
You deciding what I need to know
when I need to know it.

42:57.578 --> 42:59.288
What changed your plan?

43:00.163 --> 43:02.749
-You really need me to answer that?
-Tell me.

43:03.542 --> 43:05.627
He wasn't ever going to leave you.

43:08.213 --> 43:10.382
So you made Raych kill you.

43:11.675 --> 43:13.594
That way he would have to leave me.

43:15.470 --> 43:17.347
-You used him.
-That's unfair.

43:17.431 --> 43:18.473
You used both of us.

43:18.557 --> 43:20.517
Raych was always meant to be here.

43:21.101 --> 43:22.811
Not you. Raych.

43:22.895 --> 43:25.355
You were meant to stay on Terminus,
to lead Terminus.

43:25.439 --> 43:29.443
Exactly!
There was never a version of your plan

43:29.526 --> 43:32.196
where Raych and I were within
light-years of each other.

43:33.030 --> 43:37.701
You didn't care about what we wanted,
as long as your plan was safe!

43:38.202 --> 43:40.412
You're too smart to play the victim, Gaal.

43:41.955 --> 43:45.584
You welcomed your part in this
the moment you solved Abraxas.

43:45.667 --> 43:46.668
I what?

43:46.752 --> 43:49.213
You could've submitted the answer
anonymously.

43:49.296 --> 43:51.882
You chose recognition.

43:51.965 --> 43:54.468
No one forced you to come to Trantor.

43:54.551 --> 43:56.220
I came under false pretenses.

43:56.303 --> 43:59.097
You came knowing full well
the attention it would bring you

43:59.181 --> 44:01.517
and the danger that put your family in.

44:02.434 --> 44:04.436
You made a choice, Gaal.

44:04.520 --> 44:07.147
You wanted a different life
to the one mapped out for you.

44:07.231 --> 44:09.191
When we were hauled up
in front of the Emperor,

44:09.274 --> 44:11.360
you made a choice to lie to him.

44:12.110 --> 44:16.198
"If you kill me, the fall accelerates."
Isn't that what you told him?

44:16.281 --> 44:18.992
Fine. We're both hypocrites.

44:19.618 --> 44:22.621
If this was really only about
the path psychohistory laid out,

44:22.704 --> 44:25.791
then you would've let Cleon kill you
in that throne room.

44:26.500 --> 44:28.126
Your followers would've been exiled,

44:28.210 --> 44:30.712
and everything would've fallen into place
as planned.

44:32.047 --> 44:33.382
That's true.

44:34.716 --> 44:36.510
So why didn't you?

44:36.593 --> 44:37.719
I wanted to live.

44:38.762 --> 44:40.681
Well, so did Raych.

44:42.182 --> 44:47.813
Now I'm here instead of on Terminus,
and Raych is dead.

44:48.814 --> 44:51.900
-And that's on you. Not me.
-Is it?

44:53.068 --> 44:55.445
Don't you dare put this on me.

44:55.529 --> 44:58.532
You weren't supposed to be
anywhere near my cabin the night I died.

44:59.992 --> 45:01.577
You were meant to be swimming.

45:01.660 --> 45:05.372
Every night, 40 lengths of the pool.
Counting primes like clockwork.

45:05.455 --> 45:07.082
I've heard enough from you.

45:11.587 --> 45:13.088
I liked you better when you were dying.

45:13.172 --> 45:16.717
-You came to my cabin. Why?
-I was worried about Raych.

45:16.800 --> 45:19.428
-So why not go to his?
-I did. He wasn't there.

45:19.511 --> 45:21.555
-Then what happened?
-I don't know. I--

45:23.390 --> 45:25.184
Computer, divert from the debris field.

45:25.267 --> 45:27.436
Authorization required.

45:27.519 --> 45:29.188
Something is going to pierce the hull.

45:29.271 --> 45:31.857
Hari, if you're in the mainframe,
you can turn us around.

45:31.940 --> 45:33.400
The shields are strong.

45:33.483 --> 45:35.319
Any micro-breaches
will seal automatically.

45:35.402 --> 45:37.154
Turn us around. This is too much.

45:37.237 --> 45:39.281
-Why did you break your routine?
-I can't--

45:39.364 --> 45:41.283
Why did you get out of that pool?

45:41.366 --> 45:42.951
I know what you're trying to do.

45:43.035 --> 45:45.662
You were worried about Raych.
You went to his cabin.

45:45.746 --> 45:47.497
He wasn't there. Then what happened?

45:48.957 --> 45:52.669
86,981,803.

45:55.380 --> 45:56.715
I could feel it in the air.

45:56.798 --> 46:00.302
86,981,821.

46:00.385 --> 46:02.971
A sense of doom.

46:03.055 --> 46:04.681
I just-- I had a feeling.

46:04.765 --> 46:06.683
86,981,827.

46:06.767 --> 46:09.061
What kind of a feeling?
A memory? A vision? What?

46:09.144 --> 46:10.312
A compulsion?

46:13.524 --> 46:15.609
Like my body knew something before I did.

46:15.692 --> 46:17.444
Hari, the sky.

46:18.612 --> 46:20.906
Like knowing the Star Bridge would fall.

46:20.989 --> 46:23.242
Like knowing
when they'd come to arrest me.

46:23.325 --> 46:24.535
How are you awake?

46:25.118 --> 46:26.620
Did you say something?

46:26.703 --> 46:28.539
No. But I was going to ask--

46:28.622 --> 46:31.041
Someone would speak before they did.

46:31.124 --> 46:33.043
The prodigy speaks.

46:33.126 --> 46:35.212
86,981,000--

46:35.295 --> 46:36.922
We're all different, Ms. Dornick.

46:37.005 --> 46:39.299
And if you don't know what it is,
I urge you to figure it out

46:39.383 --> 46:42.094
before someone else does
and uses it against you.

46:42.177 --> 46:44.638
86,981,827.

46:44.721 --> 46:45.764
Terminus.

46:45.848 --> 46:46.932
You're exiling us.

46:47.641 --> 46:48.934
Did you say something?

46:50.143 --> 46:51.979
The prodigy speaks.

46:52.479 --> 46:54.565
You're exiling us.

46:54.648 --> 46:55.732
I'm sorry.

46:56.692 --> 46:57.985
How are you awake?

46:59.403 --> 47:01.029
Did you say something?

47:01.113 --> 47:02.823
-I'm sorry.
-You're exiling us.

47:03.782 --> 47:05.868
-How are you awake?
-I'm sorry.

47:05.951 --> 47:07.536
Did you say something?

47:18.672 --> 47:22.009
That's why I came to your cabin.
That's what you couldn't predict.

47:23.969 --> 47:27.181
I knew what was gonna happen
before it did.

47:27.931 --> 47:30.475
Not through math,
not through calculations…

47:32.561 --> 47:34.271
I think I can feel the future.
