00:02.202 --> 00:02.201
Previously on Ninjago...

00:02.202 --> 00:04.067
Previously on Ninjago...

00:04.304 --> 00:07.399
<i>The Ninja are still at large
and public enemy number one.</i>

00:07.708 --> 00:10.678
<i>They will be caught
and pay for their crime spree.</i>

00:11.912 --> 00:14.347
One crew down.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.477
Help! Don't leave me alone with him.

00:16.817 --> 00:19.809
Your wish is yours to keep.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

01:04.697 --> 01:06.291
Whoa! Ah!

01:06.867 --> 01:10.770
Don't look scared. Look mean.
You gotta look hard in a place like this.

01:10.971 --> 01:13.269
Meat, fresh meat, fresh meat.

01:16.443 --> 01:21.210
Don't mind them, they all get a little
grouchy when they don't get their meat.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.515
Fresh meat!

01:32.326 --> 01:34.954
Kryptarium Prison,
we've been here before,

01:35.262 --> 01:36.787
but as guests, never inmates.

01:38.799 --> 01:42.667
You can try, but those shackles
are made of vengestone.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.428
Pretty good for shutting down your powers

01:45.672 --> 01:48.903
and making sure
you don't ghost outta here.

01:49.142 --> 01:53.170
Oh, yeah? But how good are they
against my super strength!

01:55.482 --> 01:57.473
Just wait, almost got them.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.743
They aren't gonna break.

02:00.020 --> 02:05.254
Hey, aren't those the Ninja? They're
responsible for putting me in this place!

02:07.394 --> 02:09.089
And we're shuffling, we're shuffling.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.091
Since you're celebrities,
I took the liberty

02:12.332 --> 02:15.131
of taking you out
of the general population.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.565
Who doesn't love
special treatment?

02:17.804 --> 02:21.763
And placing you in the super mean
and dangerous population.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.107
Real special, all right.

02:27.481 --> 02:31.850
It's no problem, Warden. We'll do our time
until all of this is straightened out.

02:32.119 --> 02:34.349
Like I said before, we were framed.

02:34.721 --> 02:38.282
That's what they all say.
Now get in your cell, inmates!

02:39.526 --> 02:43.053
Gosh, darn it, I forgot my keys again.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.856
Look, stay here while I go find them.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.938
At least they're locked up.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.850
Nifty gadget, you make that?

03:06.053 --> 03:10.581
They call me the Mechanic.
And I got a bone to pick with you.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.462
That's one more bone
than you've got in your entire arm.

03:16.663 --> 03:20.190
Let me guess,
you don't have much of a spine, either.

03:20.500 --> 03:25.165
I used to repair noodle trucks for Master
Chen and his underground organization.

03:25.539 --> 03:29.498
When you put him outta business,
you put me outta business!

03:29.776 --> 03:32.677
Then by my observations,
that was your own error.

03:32.946 --> 03:36.075
Working for a crime boss
isn't a very reliable career choice.

03:36.283 --> 03:42.689
By my observation, actions
have consequences and you have to pay.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.985
This Nindroid here, it's got spare parts.

03:46.193 --> 03:49.925
I could use a few in a place like this.

03:50.230 --> 03:54.326
And I could use a spare arm.
These chains won't stop us.

03:54.568 --> 03:59.768
Got my keys! Oh, come on knuckleheads,
shake hands and be friends.

04:01.141 --> 04:04.736
Just wait until I get my hands
on your Nindroid.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.314
Come on, boys, back to your cells.

04:09.616 --> 04:12.051
Let's hope Dareth
gets us out of here soon.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.954
I don't know how much longer
we can last in a place like this.

04:27.033 --> 04:30.992
Cap'n, I knew it was only time
you'd come for me.

04:31.371 --> 04:36.741
Flintlocke. As my most loyal first mate,

04:36.943 --> 04:39.241
let me be the first to welcome you.

04:39.780 --> 04:44.616
I know you've been marooned
for far too long.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.477
Is your gunpowder still dry?

04:50.257 --> 04:51.418
You missed.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.053
Did I?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.694
You still got <i>m.</i>

04:56.463 --> 05:00.957
Well, what are you waiting for?
Say hello to the rest of the crew.

05:01.234 --> 05:05.694
Well if ain't be Doubloon.
What's the matter, ain't happy to see me?

05:07.240 --> 05:11.006
Dogshank. Could'a used muscle
like yours where I've been.

05:11.211 --> 05:14.511
Go fix a turbine, Monkey Wretch.

05:15.048 --> 05:19.212
A flower. Forgive me, Lady Dogshank.

05:19.519 --> 05:23.251
Never liked flowers. And I ain't no lady.

05:25.692 --> 05:29.526
And last and definitely least, Clancee.

05:29.796 --> 05:33.892
It's, uh, good to see us
all together, Flintlocke.

05:34.367 --> 05:38.463
I told everyone
I met about you and how...

05:38.705 --> 05:40.469
Clean my guns, will you, Clancee?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.005
l...

05:42.175 --> 05:46.578
So you got the band back together.
My regrets Delara is not here to see this.

05:46.880 --> 05:52.250
She will be missed, my friend.
Meanwhile, we should celebrate.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.511
You've got the Realm Crystal,
we could go anywhere.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.920
Where to, Cap'n? The Straits of Tropikana?

05:58.291 --> 06:00.419
The Isles of Sunseto?

06:00.794 --> 06:04.526
Perhaps we'll drink from coconuts
in the Cove of Crystal Waters?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.860
All of those sound nice,

06:07.033 --> 06:10.697
but I have the perfect place in mind.

06:11.338 --> 06:15.332
Oh. Well, now you've piqued my interest.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.311
<i>COLE". What are you doing
to get us outta here?</i>

06:23.483 --> 06:24.917
<i>This is no place for a Nindroid.</i>

06:25.151 --> 06:26.949
<i>I don't look good in stripes!</i>

06:27.187 --> 06:29.781
<i>They're all so mean!
Help us, you have to help us!</i>

06:30.056 --> 06:33.515
<i>Shh. While we're stuck in here,
the Djinn is out there.</i>

06:33.827 --> 06:36.296
<i>I know, I'm doing everything I can.</i>

06:36.596 --> 06:38.257
Borg wanted me to let you know

06:38.431 --> 06:40.798
that the Djinn broke
into Hiroshi's Labyrinth Stronghold

06:41.034 --> 06:45.631
and took the Realm Crystal. The good news
is, everything else is accounted for.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.398
The bad news is, the Djinn
may now have his old crew back.

06:49.709 --> 06:52.303
You have to get us outta here, Dareth.
You are our manager.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.037
What are you doing to manage this?

06:54.281 --> 06:57.649
Did you get the cake? I baked some tools
in it for you to cut through the bars.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.512
<i>Cake? We didn't get any cake!</i>

06:59.853 --> 07:03.312
<i>Uh, how was I supposed to know
there was something in it?</i>

07:03.556 --> 07:05.320
<i>I just thought it was crunchy.</i>

07:05.492 --> 07:07.654
<i>You ate our only way out?</i>

07:07.827 --> 07:11.786
<i>Well, sounds like you're on your own.
Be strong, little Ninja.</i>

07:11.965 --> 07:13.433
What do you mean, "On our own"?

07:13.700 --> 07:16.567
- You're not leaving <i>us in</i> here!
- Wait, Dareth!

07:16.870 --> 07:22.639
If anything happens to them in here,
you'll have to answer to the Brown Ninja.

07:23.009 --> 07:26.707
If there's a Brown Ninja out there,
maybe he belongs in here too.

07:26.880 --> 07:27.870
Uh,

07:28.081 --> 07:30.550
I'll give him the message. Gotta go.

07:34.087 --> 07:38.456
A little extra, since you're my favorite.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.487
You said you wanted special treatment.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.326
So the bad guys are out there,

07:44.564 --> 07:47.056
while the good guys are in here.
It's not fair.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.632
What was it your favorite
movie character would say?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.371
"Fair isn't a word where I come from."

07:52.639 --> 07:53.800
The word was "Fear",

07:54.140 --> 07:58.600
and if intergalactic space hero Fritz
Donnegan was here, we'd already be out.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.506
Is this a muffin or a fossilized rock?

08:02.882 --> 08:05.977
Earth Ninja. No one likes you.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.049
What's Earth anyway?

08:10.023 --> 08:11.582
He's a Jay fan.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.519
Hi guys, care for some Ninja company?

08:16.396 --> 08:18.262
Guess they can't all be fans.

08:18.698 --> 08:22.293
We may be out of the action, but that
doesn't mean we can't take action.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.364
So what do we know about this Djinn?

08:24.671 --> 08:27.333
Did someone say Djinn?

08:27.707 --> 08:31.007
You best not be speaking
about Nadakhan the Djinn.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.076
His name is Nadakhan the Djinn?

08:33.346 --> 08:36.280
Hey, it's Captain Soto, the first captain
of the Destiny's Bounty!

08:36.582 --> 08:40.679
And it's Jay, the whiny sniveling blue
pajama man who says everything obvious.

08:40.986 --> 08:42.852
Why can't anyone here be nice?

08:43.289 --> 08:45.018
But who be you?

08:45.658 --> 08:50.152
I don't know you. Are you a pajama woman?

08:50.430 --> 08:51.591
Yes, you could say that.

08:51.898 --> 08:56.267
No, you look really familiar
for some reason.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.437
Let's cut the small talk. You know him?

08:59.706 --> 09:04.109
Know him? I was the one who caught him!

09:04.444 --> 09:07.539
So you were the one who trapped him
in the teapot? But how?

09:07.747 --> 09:11.980
Catching a Djinn is harder than
steering a galleon upstream in a storm

09:12.285 --> 09:16.916
with a leaky hull!
But let me try to articulate me words

09:17.090 --> 09:18.854
so that ye can visualize it.

09:20.093 --> 09:26.260
Long ago me crew were aboard the Destiny's
Bounty, the finest <i>ship</i> ever built.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.662
Save one other.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.569
Misfortune's Keep.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.983
Nadakhan the Djinn was the most
feared pirate of the high seas.

09:52.258 --> 09:56.217
<i>Since he was from another realm,
his powers were unmatched.</i>

09:56.496 --> 09:59.591
He and <i>his</i> crew were always a step ahead.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.060
Load the cannon!

10:20.720 --> 10:24.418
<i>The trick to catching</i> a <i>Djinn
ain't be getting him into the vessel,</i>

10:25.024 --> 10:28.426
<i>it's making sure he don't poof away
when you try to do it.</i>

10:28.628 --> 10:31.598
- Easy, just wish him into it.
- Easy?

10:31.898 --> 10:34.731
Everyone knows
ye can't wish for more wishes,

10:34.934 --> 10:38.928
ye can't wish for love,
and ye can't wish to harm others!

10:39.172 --> 10:44.440
Wishing a Djinn into a teapot would
most certainly fall into that category.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.805
What do you mean you can't wish for love?

10:47.714 --> 10:49.944
What? I'm asking for a friend.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.175
Don't let us stop you. You were just
about to tell us how to catch a Djinn.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.423
Certainly. To stop a Djinn,

10:56.990 --> 10:58.014
you must--

10:58.191 --> 11:02.094
Well, well, well.
Looks like you saved us some seats.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.530
Now let's talk about those spare parts.

11:04.797 --> 11:09.132
Not now, sprocket arm. We're dealing
with first tier bad guys here.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.870
You're fifth tier,
maybe fourth tier, tops.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.697
Fourth tier?

11:13.973 --> 11:15.964
Look at that, pajama people,

11:16.242 --> 11:17.835
they have all the weapons!

11:18.011 --> 11:20.537
And you are chained!

11:20.713 --> 11:23.011
Yeah. Sounds like
it's almost a fair fight.

11:34.727 --> 11:36.695
Wait, don't break them up yet.

11:36.930 --> 11:41.163
- I love me a good fight scene. Popcorn?
- Oh, in that case...

11:47.240 --> 11:49.709
Where's Zane? I don't see Zane!

11:53.213 --> 11:56.080
I told them I'd get my hands on you.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.053
Where's Zane? And where's the Mechanic?

12:04.991 --> 12:07.722
Oh, look at
all those spare parts.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.558
Brace yourself,
Zane. I'm re-routing

12:10.730 --> 12:14.928
<i>all existing power to your chest
in three, two, one.</i>

12:21.074 --> 12:22.235
Thank you, P.l.X.A.L.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.103
<i>Nobody touches my Nindroid.</i>

12:26.813 --> 12:28.303
Finish what you were going to say.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.505
You said you knew how to catch Nadakhan.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.548
The only way to slow a Djinn
long enough to catch one

12:33.886 --> 12:35.945
is with the venom of a Tiger Widow.

12:36.823 --> 12:39.656
One drop is strong enough to kill a man,

12:39.959 --> 12:43.759
or tire a Djinn,
so he don't be poofing around.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.924
Tiger Widow? I've never even heard of
one of those. Where do I find one?

12:48.201 --> 12:51.102
You don't.
They be the rarest of creatures,

12:51.337 --> 12:56.537
indigenous to only one island
that's found on no map but me own.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.268
Then where's your map?

13:02.348 --> 13:05.716
All right, lunch crew, serve 'em up!

13:08.454 --> 13:12.687
Uh, no more popcorn.
I guess we should do ourjobs.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.790
Fun is over! No dessert for you.

13:17.163 --> 13:18.324
Take 'em back to their cells.

13:18.498 --> 13:22.799
Not the Ninja. They go to the hole
for starting this mess.

13:23.069 --> 13:26.164
Wait, tell us where the map is! Soto!

13:26.439 --> 13:28.771
Break me out of this place
and I'll tell ye.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.275
Ye want the map, I want me freedom.

13:32.812 --> 13:37.272
Speaking of which,
can anyone tell me where me leg is?

13:37.617 --> 13:40.348
I guess we could try to find
this Tiger Widow on our own

13:40.653 --> 13:42.280
in eight to 10 years.

13:42.555 --> 13:47.391
Or we could bust outta here tonight,
and take Soto with us.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.157
<i>I'd</i> trade all t' gold that we have reaped

13:57.737 --> 14:00.763
<i>I'd trade all t' gold
that we have reaped</i>

14:03.343 --> 14:06.313
<i>('d trade all t' gold that we have reaped</i>

14:08.715 --> 14:12.413
<i>For one more cold night
on Misfortune's Keep</i>

14:13.386 --> 14:18.415
So, Cap'n, what's next? Some looting?
Some pillaging? Or all of the above?

14:21.928 --> 14:26.525
Sadly, the world has left us behind.

14:27.266 --> 14:29.894
Pirates are nothing but a distant memory.

14:30.903 --> 14:33.133
What are ye saying, Cap'n?

14:33.473 --> 14:37.671
As the rightful captain,
I couldn't well leave my crew marooned.

14:38.211 --> 14:45.174
But now that you are all safe, tonight
I'll return to my home realm, Djinjago.

14:45.585 --> 14:49.988
But you said you'd never be welcomed
back there. What about your father?

14:50.223 --> 14:53.022
Better to live in a world
where you are hated,

14:53.626 --> 14:56.288
than in a world where you are forgotten.

14:57.764 --> 15:01.701
Then I go where my captain goes.
To Djinjago!

15:05.605 --> 15:07.266
We're all behind you, Cap'n.

15:07.507 --> 15:11.842
Tell us
what it's like. This Djinjago?

15:12.111 --> 15:16.981
It is the most beautiful place
you've ever seen.

15:17.683 --> 15:22.280
But why tell you when I can show you?

15:31.230 --> 15:34.200
What? What is happening?

15:35.835 --> 15:38.395
This
isn't beautiful, Cap'n.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.541
So, my son returns in our final hours.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.206
What plague has begotten our realm?

15:45.611 --> 15:48.444
Our sister realm has been destroyed.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.943
The Cursed Realm is no more?

15:51.284 --> 15:55.517
As you know,
the Sixteen Realms are interconnected

15:55.922 --> 15:57.947
and the balance affects us all.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.784
When one falls, another falls apart.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.931
Every action has a consequence.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.792
The Ninja.

16:09.101 --> 16:12.696
Father, I now have the power
to travel realms.

16:13.105 --> 16:16.370
I can save our people. I can save you.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.043
This is our home, son.

16:19.545 --> 16:24.949
You might have once turned
your back upon it but I never will.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.681
Cap'n, we need to leave now.

16:28.921 --> 16:31.151
Take the Sword of Souls.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.587
But that sword is meant for...
Meant for the King.

16:35.795 --> 16:39.698
Take it. It holds the life force
of our forefathers

16:39.999 --> 16:43.162
and all its enemies
that have fallen from its blade.

16:46.072 --> 16:50.509
The Ninja will pay
for what they have done.

17:02.288 --> 17:07.657
I feel. I feel their life force.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.819
Now go, son. Go!

17:12.632 --> 17:15.464
- We're running out of time.
- What was it you once said?

17:16.035 --> 17:19.403
A captain always goes down with his ship?

17:20.606 --> 17:24.440
The balance is in your hands. Avenge us.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.475
Actions have consequence.

17:59.412 --> 18:03.645
Ninjago will pay for what
the Ninja have done.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.810
This world may have forgotten about us,

18:07.587 --> 18:12.616
but when we're through with them,
they will know what it feels like

18:13.025 --> 18:16.461
to have everything they love
stolen from them.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.024
But Cap'n, we're only one ship.

18:20.566 --> 18:24.901
Don't worry, your captain has a plan.

18:26.172 --> 18:30.473
Ninjago will see something
they have never seen before.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.402
But in order for that to happen,

18:33.980 --> 18:36.779
I need more souls

18:37.116 --> 18:40.780
and who better than the Ninja!

18:50.429 --> 18:53.831
This has to literally
be our lowest point.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.828
We're in a hole! Rock bottom.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.630
On the bright side,
if we were never arrested,

18:59.805 --> 19:01.330
we never would've talked to Captain Soto.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.608
- If only we could use our powers again.
- First things first.

19:06.078 --> 19:09.309
A fork?
What are we gonna do, eat our way out?

19:09.915 --> 19:14.216
<i>I</i> was thinking...
Something else.

19:15.121 --> 19:19.319
Great, we got our powers back!
Now, how do we get outta this hole?

19:19.492 --> 19:20.982
Cole will escape through the bars.

19:21.394 --> 19:24.022
<i>Then he'll figure</i> out a way
to free the rest of us.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.829
Once we escape the hole, we find Soto.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.570
<i>Jay, make sure we're not seen!</i>

19:40.479 --> 19:41.878
Uh-huh? Huh?

19:42.048 --> 19:43.982
Come with me, quietly.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.718
Are you kidding me?

19:50.056 --> 19:53.117
Once we have Soto,
Zane <i>will</i> make sure we're not followed.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.648
Since they'll have
the main doors well-guarded,

20:21.887 --> 20:24.151
we'll need to make our exit
through the sewer pipes.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.821
Sewer pipes? Ugh, gross.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.655
If we're spotted, Nya,
help us make a quick getaway.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.527
<i>Ahoy, “war she News'.!</i>

20:42.575 --> 20:44.339
We made it!

20:54.120 --> 20:56.054
Thank you, pajama people.

20:56.288 --> 20:58.950
All right, Soto.
We held up our part of the bargain.

20:59.225 --> 21:01.717
Now you hold up yours. Where's the map?

21:02.061 --> 21:04.189
The map's hidden within a lantern.

21:04.530 --> 21:07.500
Light its candle
and it'll show you the way.

21:07.800 --> 21:11.737
Then where's the lantern?
Gosh, all you pirates are so long-winded.

21:11.971 --> 21:16.431
Ah, it'd be our nature.
We can't refuse a good treasure hunt.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.670
- Where's the lantern, Soto?
- That's the tricky part.

21:20.212 --> 21:23.671
It's aboard his ship, Misfortune's Keep.

21:23.983 --> 21:27.977
Nadakhan's ship? I thought we said
we were trying to avoid that guy.

21:29.555 --> 21:31.853
I never said it was going to be easy.

21:32.158 --> 21:37.221
Good luck, and may the winds
always be in your sails.

21:38.430 --> 21:42.298
Wait, I suddenly remember
why you look so familiar.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.730
Oh my, that be a charm!

21:47.907 --> 21:51.138
- By word, you're a spittin' image of her.
- Of who?

22:04.323 --> 22:08.783
Here's the supplies you requested.
More coconuts for the crew.

22:08.961 --> 22:12.522
Ooh, and you wouldn't believe
what's on the front page.

22:20.239 --> 22:23.937
Delara. My love.

22:27.179 --> 22:30.740
Monkey Wretch says
the restorations are going to plan.

22:31.217 --> 22:34.050
Good. But will she fly?

22:35.087 --> 22:37.886
<i>FUNTLOCKE". Oh, she'll fly soon, Cap'n.</i>

22:38.691 --> 22:40.591
<i>She'll fly soon.</i>
