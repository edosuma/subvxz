00:23.990 --> 00:25.582
Ijust love mushrooms.

00:25.750 --> 00:28.651
One of my favorites,
or as I call it...

00:28.820 --> 00:32.654
...the king of mushrooms,
is the porcini.

00:32.830 --> 00:34.957
Now, stop right there.

00:35.166 --> 00:36.633
Don't be alarmed.

00:36.801 --> 00:41.761
There's a lot of confusion
in this country between porcini...

00:41.973 --> 00:43.274
... the Italian name, and cpes,
which is the French name.

00:43.274 --> 00:47.370
... the Italian name, and cepes,
which is the French name.

00:47.545 --> 00:50.537
They're fat and they're earthy.

00:50.715 --> 00:55.709
Now, the porcini is most often seen
dried here in this country.

00:56.153 --> 00:58.621
And they would always be labeled...

01:00.124 --> 01:03.423
-...dried porcinis, not dried cepes.
-Beck!

01:03.594 --> 01:07.325
-come on!
-They are very, very, very flavorful.

01:14.171 --> 01:15.968
It's about time.
I've been waiting.

01:16.140 --> 01:20.873
Man, you're Iucky to be getting in.
It's an extremely private party tonight.

01:21.946 --> 01:25.882
-What's he drinking?
-Jagermeister and cristal.

01:26.050 --> 01:28.280
Great.

01:36.327 --> 01:39.694
-Security?
-No, but we do have a slight problem.

01:40.731 --> 01:42.665
Have fun.

01:44.302 --> 01:45.735
What's the problem?

01:48.306 --> 01:49.705
That's your problem.

01:49.874 --> 01:51.865
The guy on the Ieft
is Jalil Johnson.

01:52.043 --> 01:54.671
-I think he's the Ieft tackle.
-Jamal Johnson.

01:54.845 --> 01:56.540
Defensive end.

01:56.714 --> 02:00.445
The best defensive lineman Notre
Dame's produced in the last 20 years.

02:00.618 --> 02:02.142
Maybe ever.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.914
The guy on his Ieft
is Kambui Jackson.

02:05.089 --> 02:09.389
He ran for 2000 yards last year,
All-Pro five years in a row.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.520
The guy in the headband,
that's Fernando Lewis.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.460
Middle Iinebacker.

02:14.665 --> 02:16.656
Plays a lot like Ray Lewis.

02:17.668 --> 02:20.660
-He just hits harder.
-Whatever. I'm not into football.

02:20.871 --> 02:24.068
The other two guys
are Jimmy coggeshell...

02:24.241 --> 02:25.936
...and David Mulaire.

02:26.844 --> 02:29.335
One's from USC.
The other one's from Ohio State.

02:30.014 --> 02:31.242
Stay down, bitch!

02:31.415 --> 02:34.350
The guy you're Iooking for is there.
Brian Knappmiller.

02:36.053 --> 02:38.021
Throws like Brett Favre.

02:38.189 --> 02:39.952
Bets like Pete Rose.

02:40.124 --> 02:43.753
So I'm telling this cat, I'm Iike,
"Yo, I know it's you that jumped.

02:43.928 --> 02:45.862
I saw you.
Don't tell me it's not you."

02:46.030 --> 02:47.793
He's Iike, "I don't know."

02:47.998 --> 02:50.660
-Excuse me.
-"Trust me. It's you, I know."

02:50.868 --> 02:53.302
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you guys.

02:53.471 --> 02:55.063
-I apologize. I need--
-My man.

02:55.272 --> 02:58.764
I ain't got no hookups to tryout
camps. You just gotta show up.

02:58.943 --> 03:00.376
I think you'II be all right.

03:00.544 --> 03:02.637
So I'm telling the cat,
"I don't want--"

03:02.813 --> 03:05.373
Excuse me. I'm not here
to talk about tryouts.

03:05.549 --> 03:08.177
-If I could have a minute--
-I got it. Pass me that.

03:08.352 --> 03:11.150
Who do I make this out to, man?

03:11.555 --> 03:13.989
Who do I make it out to?
What's your name?

03:14.158 --> 03:15.853
-Beck.
-Beck?

03:16.026 --> 03:17.357
B-E-c-K.

03:18.462 --> 03:19.929
-What's up?
-What's happening?

03:20.097 --> 03:21.894
Here you go.
Knock yourself out.

03:22.099 --> 03:23.726
-AII right?
-Thank you.

03:23.934 --> 03:27.097
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna come back, or what?

03:28.672 --> 03:30.606
Excuse me.

03:30.775 --> 03:33.141
-I'm really--
-What are you doing, man?

03:33.310 --> 03:37.110
A couple of months ago, you made
wagers with an associate of mine.

03:37.281 --> 03:39.545
-Two, three months ago.
-What's up, Knappy?

03:39.717 --> 03:42.481
-Nothing. It's good. Enjoy your drink.
-What's up?

03:43.220 --> 03:47.054
Yo, bets? You embarrass me
in front of friends about bets?

03:47.224 --> 03:50.591
I don't mean to embarrass you.
This is embarrassing to me.

03:50.761 --> 03:54.162
-$50,000. You might remember.
-Yeah, I know what it is, man.

03:54.365 --> 03:57.357
Listen, there's a G to get me started.
Now do me a favor.

03:57.568 --> 04:00.036
Tell your man I'II see him Monday
with the rest...

04:00.237 --> 04:04.674
...and not to send anybody else
to see me, all right?

04:10.347 --> 04:12.315
Brian.

04:12.483 --> 04:14.508
I'm gonna need some collateral
from you.

04:14.685 --> 04:16.915
What?

04:17.788 --> 04:19.813
I'm gonna need the ring.

04:28.299 --> 04:31.132
-I'm sorry.
-You're--? Are you--?

04:32.136 --> 04:34.104
SIip it under the table,
on the Iow-Iow.

04:34.305 --> 04:36.796
-I'II make sure you get it back.
-On the Iow-Iow.

04:37.074 --> 04:40.168
-I'II give it to you. Want a drink too?
-Thank you.

04:41.011 --> 04:43.411
Take the ring.
That's what I think about that.

04:43.581 --> 04:46.675
Get the hell on, man.
Go, man! Go!

04:46.851 --> 04:49.251
-Do something with this.
-You heard the man.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.045
Yo, man, get up!

04:53.491 --> 04:54.719
Okay.

04:55.826 --> 04:59.523
Yeah, that's right, playboy, walk.
Go on, man!

04:59.697 --> 05:01.688
You wanna jump?

05:01.866 --> 05:03.333
Get your ass out of here.

05:12.443 --> 05:13.910
You all right?

05:14.745 --> 05:16.804
This shit burns.

05:23.287 --> 05:24.515
Hey, it's me.

05:24.688 --> 05:27.486
Oh, yeah, he's here.
We got a problem, though.

05:27.658 --> 05:33.153
He's got the entire offensive Iine.
The entire offensive Iine is here.

05:34.465 --> 05:37.434
Let me do it another night.
How about that?

05:37.635 --> 05:39.694
They've got a shot
at repeating this year.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.702
I do not want to hurt them.
I don't want to go out--

05:44.608 --> 05:47.133
Okay, Billy.

06:05.996 --> 06:08.260
Knappmiller!
You got two choices.

06:08.465 --> 06:10.660
Option A, you give me the ring.

06:10.868 --> 06:13.632
Option B,
I make you give me the ring.

06:14.171 --> 06:16.002
I'II take B.

06:17.374 --> 06:18.773
Wrong choice.

06:47.671 --> 06:49.161
Okay.

07:14.064 --> 07:15.588
Yeah, put him down, man!

07:42.259 --> 07:47.060
-Yo, what's with all this hostility?
-You should have taken option A.

08:38.982 --> 08:40.539
Are you all right, mate?

08:41.284 --> 08:43.253
Are you okay?

08:49.727 --> 08:51.456
Thanks, mate.

09:02.673 --> 09:04.698
-There he is.
-Why'd you send him, Billy?

09:04.875 --> 09:07.571
Martin? Oh, he was just a backup.

09:07.745 --> 09:11.010
After I got your call,
I wasn't so sure you could deliver.

09:11.181 --> 09:13.240
-What happened?
-He stole it from me!

09:13.417 --> 09:17.217
He got you
with those beanbags? No.

09:17.387 --> 09:19.912
It is gonna be 1 0 off your vig,
anyway, you know.

09:20.090 --> 09:23.355
Billy, you know I've got plans!
Stop nickel-and-diming me.

09:23.527 --> 09:25.859
It's a tough business,
the restaurant business.

09:26.029 --> 09:29.487
I hear 75 percent of them fail
the first year. Do you know why?

09:29.666 --> 09:32.260
Undercapitalization, that's why.
I don't think--

09:32.469 --> 09:36.838
Billy, I want out, I want a new Iife.
I want my money, and I want it now!

09:37.341 --> 09:39.309
Now?

09:40.177 --> 09:42.577
Now.

09:44.648 --> 09:46.548
Okay.

09:52.422 --> 09:54.253
One job.

09:54.424 --> 09:57.086
One job, I wipe your slate clean...

09:58.695 --> 10:01.755
...and you have your restaurant.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.631
come on, open it up.

10:06.503 --> 10:08.437
come on.

10:13.043 --> 10:15.807
That's a photo
of Travis AIfred Walker.

10:15.979 --> 10:19.278
Stanford dropout, treasure hunter.
Only to date...

10:19.449 --> 10:22.509
...the only thing he's found
is trouble.

10:22.686 --> 10:24.517
-Did you say, "Walker"?
-My son.

10:24.688 --> 10:27.384
From my third marriage.
Lasted about three minutes.

10:27.925 --> 10:29.950
That picture was taken
two months ago...

10:30.127 --> 10:33.858
...in some gold-mining town called EI
Dorado in the middle of the Amazon.

10:34.031 --> 10:35.396
-How much?
-250 Iarge.

10:35.599 --> 10:38.033
For that much,
why not invite him back yourself?

10:38.202 --> 10:41.035
-The boy doesn't trust me.
-Kidnapping's gonna help.

10:41.705 --> 10:43.229
Is that sarcasm?

10:44.174 --> 10:46.836
You wanna be sarcastic,
do it to your monkey friends!

10:47.010 --> 10:50.878
You do not do it to me!
Do you understand?

10:54.685 --> 10:55.913
I'm sorry, Billy.

10:56.486 --> 10:58.784
You're goddamn right you are.

11:01.592 --> 11:04.823
-What'd he do?
-Pissed off the wrong people.

11:05.729 --> 11:09.221
I don't have to remind you
what happens when you do that, do I?

11:09.433 --> 11:11.162
So I bought him some forgiveness.

11:11.368 --> 11:13.893
But if I don't bring him back
to face the music...

11:14.104 --> 11:17.232
...you know damn well
that I can't carry a tune.

11:17.441 --> 11:22.276
So you deliver my boy back here,
you bring him right through that door...

11:22.446 --> 11:27.748
...you walk out of this house
a free man, with a restaurant.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.148
Is that duct tape?

12:07.658 --> 12:12.118
Don't worry there, Iittle fella.
Walk by faith, not by sight.

12:17.868 --> 12:20.496
Will you Iook at that?
We can't Iand now.

12:20.704 --> 12:24.504
-Why? Why can't we Iand?
-They got the bulls on the ground.

12:25.042 --> 12:27.670
"Booze on the grind"?

12:27.844 --> 12:30.176
The bulls. On the ground.
cattle down there.

12:30.347 --> 12:31.575
-cows?
-Yeah.

12:31.748 --> 12:34.808
I'II give them a wee fright there.
Get moving! come on!

12:35.452 --> 12:36.714
Out of me way!

12:37.387 --> 12:39.355
Out the way, you!

12:39.556 --> 12:41.683
Move it! Move it now!

12:45.462 --> 12:47.657
Out my way!

12:49.266 --> 12:50.790
Out me way!

13:13.357 --> 13:15.985
AII right there, Iittle fella.
Okay, gotcha.

13:16.159 --> 13:20.528
What did I tell you about the Iamp?
My needle was totally knackered.

13:20.731 --> 13:22.995
Rpm's all over the shop.

13:24.901 --> 13:28.337
-Is this the only road in and out?
-If you wanna stay alive.

13:28.505 --> 13:31.633
-Why is that?
-There. That's the jungle, Iittle fella.

13:31.808 --> 13:33.332
You got anacondas in there.

13:33.510 --> 13:36.673
Poison arrow frogs, black flies,
bullet ants.

13:36.847 --> 13:38.940
If they don't get you,
the rebels will.

13:39.116 --> 13:41.710
-What?
-Rebels. That's what I'm telling you.

13:41.885 --> 13:45.548
To them, cornelius Hatcher's
built a Babylon in paradise.

13:45.722 --> 13:48.190
-Built a what?
-A Babylon.

13:52.996 --> 13:57.330
Yeah, that mine is as close as a man
can come to the gates of hell...

13:57.834 --> 13:59.495
...while his heart's still beating.

14:06.076 --> 14:08.738
The Sunday school picnic is over,
I'II tell you that.

14:08.912 --> 14:11.073
Stay out of the jungle,
Iittle fella, okay?

14:52.322 --> 14:55.883
I found these flowers growing
in the deepest parts of the jungle.

14:56.059 --> 14:59.392
I mean, as far as I can tell,
no one's ever identified them...

14:59.563 --> 15:02.225
...which means I'm responsible
for naming them.

15:02.432 --> 15:06.892
I can only think of one word
that fits something so beautiful.

15:08.105 --> 15:10.403
Mariana.

15:12.909 --> 15:15.377
How much do you want?

15:15.545 --> 15:16.944
-What?
-How much?

15:17.114 --> 15:19.844
I need your uncle's boat.
A day or two, max. Mariana--

15:20.016 --> 15:22.382
You borrow my car,
bring it back with no windshield.

15:22.552 --> 15:24.850
-My brother's scooter--
-That wasn't my fault.

15:25.021 --> 15:26.955
Now you want to borrow
my uncle's boat?

15:27.124 --> 15:30.457
"I found it, I found it." You'II never
find this Garbo of yours.

15:31.128 --> 15:34.097
-It's "Gato," I told you.
-Gato.

15:34.264 --> 15:38.257
It's out there, Mariana.
I know exactly where it is.

15:38.468 --> 15:40.299
But I need that boat.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.008
-How much?
-I told you, I--

15:46.176 --> 15:47.837
No. How much is your Gato worth?

15:48.011 --> 15:50.309
This is a very significant
academic find.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.209
-How much?
-It's not about money.

15:52.382 --> 15:55.010
-You Iie Iike a Iittle girl, Travis.
-I'm not Iying.

15:55.519 --> 15:59.319
If I get the boat for you,
you have to take me with you.

15:59.489 --> 16:01.684
Ridiculous.
We're talking about a boat.

16:01.858 --> 16:05.294
-And we split the take 50-50.
-I've been doing all the work, okay?

16:05.462 --> 16:09.159
-I found it. No way.
-50-50, Travis.

16:11.034 --> 16:13.025
-70-30.
-50-50.

16:13.236 --> 16:15.898
-60-40.
-50-50, and I get off work at 6.

16:16.072 --> 16:18.165
Then we can go and get your Gato.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.835
You're evil.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.272
-Thank you.
-Whatever.

16:25.448 --> 16:27.916
For the flowers.

16:50.407 --> 16:53.808
Harvey! We're here
to see your brother.

16:54.744 --> 16:55.802
Where's he from?

16:55.979 --> 16:58.243
-He's an American.
-You got a gun?

16:58.415 --> 16:59.814
No, I don't Iike guns.

16:59.983 --> 17:02.008
check him.

17:08.023 --> 17:11.289
-What's the current payout?
-Give me a payout for Quadrant 3.

17:22.339 --> 17:26.105
2425, down 20 percent.

17:44.995 --> 17:46.223
Checked him?

17:46.396 --> 17:48.125
AII right, Iet's go.

17:48.331 --> 17:49.821
come on.

17:50.066 --> 17:52.034
come on.

17:52.435 --> 17:55.495
I never met an American
who didn't Iike guns.

18:02.379 --> 18:04.847
Tell them to dig harder.

18:05.382 --> 18:08.818
If only it were that simple,
eh, Mr. Beck?

18:09.819 --> 18:12.515
-How do you know my name?
-When a man of your dimensions...

18:12.689 --> 18:15.852
...travels all this way
to visit a place Iike this...

18:16.026 --> 18:18.221
...it arouses the curiosity.

18:18.395 --> 18:20.454
What can I do for you?

18:20.630 --> 18:22.962
Do you know this man?

18:24.200 --> 18:25.599
Travis Walker.

18:25.769 --> 18:27.760
I Iet him excavate
around the mine...

18:27.971 --> 18:29.962
...allow him to rent a room
in my town...

18:30.173 --> 18:33.165
...all for a fair 60 percent
of anything he might unearth.

18:33.343 --> 18:35.811
-Where can I find him?
-Follow the bullshit.

18:35.979 --> 18:39.574
-Guy's mouth should be in the circus.
-Brother, please.

18:39.749 --> 18:42.411
-Do you have business with him?
-I do.

18:42.585 --> 18:44.815
What kind of business?
I Iove business.

18:44.988 --> 18:46.819
-It's personal.
-So...

18:47.590 --> 18:50.753
-...why come to me?
-When I'm a guest in a man's house...

18:50.927 --> 18:53.862
...I don't reach into his refrigerator
without permission.

18:54.898 --> 18:56.331
Refrigerator.

18:56.499 --> 18:58.865
I want to show you something,
Mr. Beck, please.

19:05.942 --> 19:10.106
Does that Iook Iike
a refrigerator to you?

19:14.351 --> 19:16.182
Looks more Iike hell.

19:16.653 --> 19:21.113
Where you see hell, I see
a spellbinding sense of purpose.

19:21.291 --> 19:26.695
I see the value of keeping your eye
on the ball.

19:27.564 --> 19:29.862
When a bride slips the ring
on her finger...

19:30.066 --> 19:33.126
...when a businessman lays his hands
on a Rolex...

19:33.336 --> 19:38.933
...when a rapper gets a shiny new
tooth, this is that cost, Mr. Beck.

19:39.109 --> 19:43.910
My horror for their beauty.
My hell for their Iittle slice of heaven.

19:45.382 --> 19:48.579
Somebody's gotta keep his eye
on the ball.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.686
That somebody is me, Mr. Beck.

19:50.854 --> 19:55.882
I am down here every day
keeping my eye on the ball.

19:56.059 --> 19:58.357
That's just a simple fact of life.

19:58.528 --> 20:02.225
And if you're bold enough
to face that cold, hard fact...

20:03.233 --> 20:05.633
...you can make a Iot of money.

20:08.872 --> 20:11.966
-What do you want with the kid?
-I've come to take him home.

20:14.144 --> 20:16.942
That'II cost you $1 0,000.

20:18.748 --> 20:21.649
-I need to borrow the jeep.
-Wait a minute, friend.

20:21.818 --> 20:24.514
I'II give you $1 000.

20:25.555 --> 20:27.614
I'II give you $1 000.

20:27.791 --> 20:31.750
I need you to take my bag back to
the plane, keep the engine running.

20:31.928 --> 20:33.919
-can you do that?
-For $1 000?

20:34.097 --> 20:37.089
-That's right.
-I'II find a way.

20:40.570 --> 20:44.404
Declan. I'm gonna be coming fast.

21:07.063 --> 21:09.361
American?

21:09.866 --> 21:11.060
Yeah.

21:15.805 --> 21:17.636
Where from?

21:17.807 --> 21:20.469
Someplace that's got bartenders.

21:35.191 --> 21:36.920
What can I get you?

21:40.497 --> 21:42.727
I'II take a beer.

21:43.933 --> 21:45.423
Nice flowers.

21:49.873 --> 21:52.000
"The smiling fool."

21:53.843 --> 21:58.212
Back in the States, Brazil nuts
Iike these go for $1 5 a pound.

21:59.716 --> 22:02.480
Well, those fell off the tree
out back.

22:02.652 --> 22:05.177
And around here,
we don't call them Brazil nuts.

22:05.822 --> 22:08.552
-What do you call them?
-Well, we're in Brazil...

22:08.725 --> 22:10.625
...so we just call them nuts.

22:12.762 --> 22:15.094
-Fair enough.
-What brings you to the Amazon...

22:15.298 --> 22:18.290
...other than the food and drink,
of course?

22:19.369 --> 22:21.929
-I'm Iooking for a man.
-What's your type?

22:22.572 --> 22:24.199
His name's Travis Walker.

22:25.341 --> 22:28.742
Brown hair. He's in his 20s.
Wears a blue shirt, jeans.

22:28.912 --> 22:31.972
Right now he's got a real
bewildered Iook on his face.

22:32.148 --> 22:34.616
-Do I know you?
-Name's Beck.

22:35.485 --> 22:38.784
-What can I do for you?
-I need you to make a choice for me.

22:38.955 --> 22:40.547
A choice?

22:40.723 --> 22:43.248
-Option A or option B.
-What's option A?

22:43.426 --> 22:46.259
Option A is, you and I
walk out of here nice and easy...

22:46.429 --> 22:48.420
...and drive back to the airstrip.

22:48.631 --> 22:51.998
And then we begin our Iong journey
back to Los Angeles.

22:52.168 --> 22:55.103
There'II be no blood,
no broken bones...

22:55.905 --> 22:58.271
...and no problems.

22:58.441 --> 23:01.535
-What's in Los Angeles?
-Your father.

23:06.215 --> 23:10.208
-What's option B?
-Pretty much the opposite of A.

23:11.688 --> 23:14.156
But I wouldn't recommend that one.

23:14.324 --> 23:16.952
I'II take option c.

23:17.193 --> 23:20.720
Travis, there is no option c.

23:20.897 --> 23:22.387
Really?

23:24.634 --> 23:26.261
Are you sure?

23:26.736 --> 23:31.730
I mean, big boy,
there's always an option c.

23:39.249 --> 23:40.477
So angry!

23:40.651 --> 23:42.141
-Shut up.
-Shut up!

23:44.822 --> 23:47.222
Like I said,
there is no option c.

23:52.096 --> 23:55.759
-Let me introduce you to option c.
-Mr. Beck...

23:59.470 --> 24:01.904
...there's been a slight change
in the narrative.

24:02.072 --> 24:05.803
-An unexpected twist, you might say.
-can I have a beer, please?

24:07.244 --> 24:10.372
Mr. Hatcher, I was just gonna
come find you when this--

24:10.547 --> 24:12.777
The kid stays.

24:12.950 --> 24:14.747
-I paid you.
-Well, fortunately...

24:14.918 --> 24:17.045
...I had my fingers crossed
the whole time.

24:17.221 --> 24:19.451
Apparently, young Mr. Walker...

24:19.623 --> 24:21.887
...may have stumbled
onto a trinket of value.

24:22.059 --> 24:25.927
And as he's Iocated it
in my jungle...

24:26.430 --> 24:29.228
...I'm gonna need him
to Iead me to it.

24:37.007 --> 24:38.668
Okay, so Iet's go, dickhead.

24:39.043 --> 24:41.011
Don't call me a dickhead,
you dickhead.

24:41.178 --> 24:43.806
-Did you find it or not, asshole?
-What, asshole?

24:43.981 --> 24:45.972
-Did you find it or not?
-What's that?

24:46.150 --> 24:48.641
-Did you find it or not, asshole?
-Don't!

24:48.819 --> 24:50.719
Hey, don't rock the boat.

24:55.059 --> 24:56.959
Okay.

24:58.829 --> 25:01.730
-I don't want any trouble.
-Leave now. Don't come back.

25:01.932 --> 25:04.765
-And the 1 0,000?
-consider it tax deductible.

25:04.935 --> 25:07.870
A contribution
to your personal health fund.

25:08.038 --> 25:10.438
With all due respect, Mr. Hatcher...

25:10.708 --> 25:13.268
-...I'm feeling pretty healthy.
-Oh, yeah?

25:13.444 --> 25:14.741
Walk.

25:16.980 --> 25:18.914
Don't make waves.

25:56.826 --> 25:58.885
You're gonna kill us all, Mr. Beck?

26:14.077 --> 26:15.510
I tried to be reasonable.

26:17.881 --> 26:19.610
That's not the way to do business.

26:27.991 --> 26:29.754
You should've kept the gun.

26:45.008 --> 26:48.273
You're dead already.
You just don't know it yet.

26:48.945 --> 26:49.112
This is option B?
Are you kidding me?

26:49.112 --> 26:51.478
This is option B?
Are you kidding me?

26:51.648 --> 26:52.945
Quiet.

26:53.116 --> 26:55.311
You're dead. You're so dead.

26:57.453 --> 27:00.581
We won't get out of here.
AII this Iand, Hatcher owns it.

27:00.757 --> 27:03.385
The road, the air,
Hatcher owns it all.

27:03.560 --> 27:05.790
-Shut up.
-Whatever my dad is paying you...

27:05.962 --> 27:07.293
-...I will double it.
-No.

27:07.463 --> 27:08.794
-I'II quadruple it.
-No.

27:08.998 --> 27:10.556
-Double it and quadruple it.
-No.

27:10.767 --> 27:12.064
You're being unreasonable!

27:14.037 --> 27:17.871
-I'II give you a chance to reconsider.
-You get one more chance to shut up.

27:18.041 --> 27:20.373
Is that your final answer?

27:22.946 --> 27:25.710
For what it's worth,
I hope you enjoy the fall.

27:25.882 --> 27:27.509
-Yeah, what fall?
-This fall.

29:00.209 --> 29:02.575
come on, big boy,
where's the frigging keys?

29:03.479 --> 29:05.140
AII right.

29:17.994 --> 29:19.586
Travis?

29:21.164 --> 29:22.392
Good God!

29:25.802 --> 29:27.167
Travis!

29:32.008 --> 29:35.000
-I'm not going back.
-Oh, you're going back.

29:35.178 --> 29:36.509
No way.

29:36.679 --> 29:40.479
-Right now.
-Who the hell do you think you are?

29:40.650 --> 29:44.950
You come into my town,
mess up my bar...

29:45.121 --> 29:47.851
-...and you eyeball my woman?
-Eyeball your woman?

29:48.624 --> 29:49.886
It's on.

29:51.761 --> 29:53.820
What's this?

29:53.997 --> 29:56.830
Who is this? Is he your friend?
Do you know him?

29:57.033 --> 29:59.331
Do you? Say hello.

29:59.502 --> 30:02.232
Say hello. Say hello.

30:10.079 --> 30:12.445
Are you finished?
Let's go.

30:13.950 --> 30:17.442
Big boy, you Iike thunderstorms?

30:17.954 --> 30:19.512
Bet you do, right?

30:20.857 --> 30:22.222
-Little thunder?
-Stop it.

30:22.392 --> 30:23.620
-Little Iightning?
-Stop!

30:23.793 --> 30:26.193
Thunder? Lightning?
Thunder? Lightning? Ears--

30:28.931 --> 30:30.728
You done beating me up?
Let's go.

30:31.134 --> 30:32.761
-I'm tired of this.
-You win.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.203
come on! Go to sleep.

30:39.375 --> 30:42.276
Go to sleep. Night-night.

30:42.512 --> 30:46.004
Night-night. Go to sleep now!
come on!

30:53.923 --> 30:56.687
Obviously, we got off
on the wrong foot here.

30:56.859 --> 31:00.056
So I'm gonna be completely
candid with you.

31:00.363 --> 31:02.729
Have you ever heard
of the Gato do Diabo?

31:02.932 --> 31:05.901
-The Devil's cat?
-You're gonna stop speaking now.

31:06.102 --> 31:07.433
AII right. It's--

31:08.971 --> 31:10.939
It's a priceless object, man.

31:11.908 --> 31:14.342
Forged out of pure gold.

31:14.510 --> 31:16.375
-Worth millions.
-You said priceless.

31:16.546 --> 31:19.481
You do not want to argue semantics
with a Ph.D. candidate.

31:19.649 --> 31:21.139
-Ph.D.?
-Yeah.

31:22.985 --> 31:25.476
I am really very close
to being Dr. Travis Walker.

31:25.655 --> 31:28.920
You dropped out of Stanford
after two semesters, Einstein.

31:30.226 --> 31:32.353
So I'm fairly close.
closer than you.

31:32.528 --> 31:34.689
close to getting your ass
kicked again.

31:34.864 --> 31:37.799
Wait, wait, wait!
The Gato is real, all right?

31:37.967 --> 31:39.434
I know where to find it.

31:39.635 --> 31:41.796
-I'II split it with you, 80-20.
-Move!

31:42.271 --> 31:44.171
70-30?

31:45.441 --> 31:48.842
You're a very unpleasant individual,
you know that?

32:14.637 --> 32:16.298
You think they're dead?

32:16.472 --> 32:18.838
What am I, psychic?

32:19.008 --> 32:21.841
I'm gonna cut that kid's nose off.

32:25.214 --> 32:26.511
No, Harvey.

32:26.682 --> 32:29.310
You want the Gato
because if the bad guys get it...

32:29.485 --> 32:31.510
...they won't need us anymore.

32:31.687 --> 32:35.316
There'II be no one to work the mine.
You want to work the mine?

32:44.066 --> 32:47.661
There are two men in that jungle
who are trying to steal from me.

32:47.870 --> 32:51.863
I feel Iike a Iittle boy
who's Iost his first tooth...

32:52.074 --> 32:56.602
...put it under his pillow,
waiting for the tooth fairy to come.

32:56.779 --> 33:01.773
Only, two evil burglars
have crept in my window...

33:01.951 --> 33:05.546
...and snatched it
before she could get here.

33:07.723 --> 33:13.286
Wait a second. Do you understand
the concept of the tooth fairy?

33:19.669 --> 33:21.159
Explain it to them.

33:21.938 --> 33:24.566
You find a tooth,
you put it under your pillow.

33:25.675 --> 33:27.734
The fairy comes...

33:28.277 --> 33:30.245
...waiting for the tooth.

33:31.147 --> 33:34.275
Wait. She takes the goddamn thing,
gives you a quarter!

33:34.450 --> 33:36.384
They got my tooth!

33:36.953 --> 33:38.853
I want it back.

33:53.769 --> 33:57.728
I have to ask you,
back at the bar, man. That was crazy!

33:57.940 --> 33:59.737
No guns. Strip, toss, toss, strip.

33:59.909 --> 34:02.844
-Didn't I tell you to be quiet?
-I know, but what is that?

34:03.012 --> 34:07.449
Some kind of nouveau samurai code?
You got a problem with guns?

34:07.617 --> 34:09.949
They take me to a place
I don't wanna go.

34:10.119 --> 34:11.380
Where do they take you?

34:12.021 --> 34:14.784
To a place you
don't wanna see me go. Walk!

34:17.126 --> 34:19.219
How often do you work out?

34:24.634 --> 34:25.965
Let me get this straight.

34:26.135 --> 34:27.898
-You never use guns?
-No.

34:28.070 --> 34:29.867
-Never?
-Never.

34:30.039 --> 34:32.098
What if your best friend
was gonna die?

34:32.275 --> 34:33.536
No guns.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.802
Santa would do it
to save his best friend.

34:35.978 --> 34:37.342
Do I Iook Iike Santa claus?

34:37.813 --> 34:40.281
-Do I Iook Iike Santa claus to you?
-What is it?

34:40.449 --> 34:43.475
Guns make you um pouco louco?
Bang-bang crazy?

34:43.652 --> 34:46.315
I pick up guns, bad things happen.
I don't Iike that.

34:46.489 --> 34:49.514
-What kind of things?
-Very bad things, Travis. Walk.

34:50.525 --> 34:52.926
-What about knives?
-Move!

34:53.529 --> 34:55.621
My father doesn't share
the same distaste.

34:55.831 --> 34:58.823
-He's your father. He won't kill you.
-AII he cares about...

34:59.035 --> 35:02.300
...is what's good for business.
Now, the question is, Mr. Beck...

35:02.471 --> 35:04.371
...what's good for your business?

35:04.640 --> 35:06.403
You don't Iike money?

35:07.476 --> 35:09.467
I don't make deals
with people Iike you.

35:10.246 --> 35:14.012
-You don't even know me.
-You're Iike every jackass I take down.

35:14.183 --> 35:17.516
First they try to run, then fight,
then they try to negotiate.

35:17.687 --> 35:21.748
When that fails, they do what you're
about to do when you realize it's over.

35:21.924 --> 35:23.585
Oh, yeah? What's that?

35:23.759 --> 35:27.286
You're gonna get down on your hands
and knees and beg me for a break.

35:27.463 --> 35:30.261
Well, guess what.
I don't give breaks.

35:30.599 --> 35:31.861
No breaks.

35:33.169 --> 35:34.932
You don't understand the situation.

35:35.104 --> 35:37.072
You borrowed money
from the wrong guy.

35:37.273 --> 35:41.369
You slept with the wrong guy's wife.
I don't care.

35:42.144 --> 35:43.736
Your mistake.

35:44.213 --> 35:48.081
What about you, Mr. Beck?
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

35:49.852 --> 35:52.013
I know! Move.

35:54.390 --> 35:57.553
No breaks. That's Iame.

35:57.727 --> 36:01.163
No breaks!
No, I don't give breaks.

36:01.330 --> 36:04.231
Santa claus doesn't give
any breaks.

36:23.853 --> 36:26.913
-Should've been at the airstrip by now.
-Like I'm gonna help.

36:27.089 --> 36:28.920
I didn't ask for your help.

36:32.962 --> 36:35.362
-What are you doing?
-I have to pee.

36:35.531 --> 36:37.362
-Pee in your pants. Move.
-No.

36:37.767 --> 36:41.203
I've Iet you push me around
this jungle for, Iike, five hours.

36:41.404 --> 36:45.238
You've been very aggressive, and I'm
not moving until you Iet me pee.

36:45.408 --> 36:49.037
If you wanna keep going, you'II have
to carry me. I'II pee on your head.

36:49.211 --> 36:51.907
You threatening me?
You threatening me with pee?

36:52.081 --> 36:54.447
Well, yeah,

36:55.718 --> 36:57.845
Fine. You win.

36:58.087 --> 36:59.645
Pee.

37:00.055 --> 37:01.750
-Will you unzip me?
-No, I won't.

37:01.924 --> 37:05.360
-You wanna pee, you got 30 seconds.
-How can with I my hands cuffed?

37:05.528 --> 37:06.893
Find a way. Pee.

37:07.563 --> 37:09.155

37:09.365 --> 37:11.333
Don't make it weird.

37:15.337 --> 37:17.100
PIease?

37:20.309 --> 37:22.402
Don't breathe, don't say a word.

37:26.182 --> 37:28.810
Don't even Iook at me.
Look over there.

37:35.357 --> 37:36.619
Thanks, man.

37:41.497 --> 37:43.465

37:52.208 --> 37:54.506

38:17.466 --> 38:19.696
Don't Iisten to Tiny Tim, okay?

38:19.902 --> 38:22.871
You're the real big boy.
Everybody knows it.

38:23.038 --> 38:27.702
Ready? One, two, three, go.

38:29.612 --> 38:31.637
One, two, three, go, go, go, go!

Oh, yeah.

38:38.053 --> 38:40.112
Oh, boy.

38:48.564 --> 38:50.862

38:51.100 --> 38:52.897

38:53.135 --> 38:54.534
Travis! Hey!

38:55.671 --> 38:58.265

38:58.440 --> 39:00.704
Looks Iike big boy

39:00.876 --> 39:03.310
Hey! Hey!

39:04.380 --> 39:06.507
-Shit.

39:06.715 --> 39:10.651
-You've got problems.
-That's-- Don't do it, Travis.

39:12.087 --> 39:15.250
Hey. Hey, get me down. Travis.

39:15.424 --> 39:18.825
Oh, what's this? Is this your diary?

39:18.994 --> 39:21.792

Give it to me!

39:28.404 --> 39:30.770
You're Iike a Iittle birdie up there!

39:33.676 --> 39:36.042
I will kill you.
You better give me that book.

39:36.512 --> 39:39.879
"Shrimp and pea risotto
with basil and mint."

39:40.115 --> 39:42.811
-Are you a chef?
-None of your business. Give it back!

39:42.985 --> 39:45.317
Looks Iike you're
Wolfgang Stuck right here.

39:45.487 --> 39:46.886
Travis! Travis!

39:47.189 --> 39:50.852
-Hey! I Iet you pee.
-Oh, yeah, you did. You did.

39:51.026 --> 39:52.926
Thank you so much.
Do you have to pee?

39:53.095 --> 39:55.461
Well, you got 30 seconds.
Go ahead and pee.

39:58.133 --> 39:59.532
Oh, shit.

40:01.971 --> 40:05.338
-Hey, I was kidding about what I said.
-Give me the book.

40:05.507 --> 40:08.237
-I don't want it. I don't want it.
-Turn around.

40:08.644 --> 40:11.044
-Why you always gotta hit me?
-Now Iisten to me.

40:11.213 --> 40:13.647
We gotta get to this tree.
Let's go back to back.

40:13.816 --> 40:15.807
AII right. Okay.

40:16.185 --> 40:19.120
-Kick your Iegs!
-I'm trying! I'm kicking my Iegs!

40:19.288 --> 40:21.950
-Where are you?
-Grab me. Grab my back, not my ass.

40:22.124 --> 40:23.614
-Got it?
-I got it. Got it.

40:23.792 --> 40:25.521
Oh, great! You did it!

40:25.694 --> 40:28.185
-Now what?
-Put your arm over me. Get to the tree.

40:28.397 --> 40:30.365
-Listen.
-You're Iike Joe Pig-snare?

40:30.566 --> 40:32.500
Put your arm over me!

40:33.502 --> 40:36.994
-Just stop moving!
-The vine. You gotta grab the--

40:38.974 --> 40:40.498
What was that?

40:41.644 --> 40:44.374
-Oh, shit.
-What was that?

40:45.614 --> 40:46.911
Monkeys.

40:53.155 --> 40:54.850
Steady.

40:55.691 --> 40:57.488
Steady.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.221
Steady.

41:00.729 --> 41:02.526
Steady.

41:06.435 --> 41:07.834
Steady!

41:10.706 --> 41:12.105
Oh, God!

41:17.613 --> 41:19.274
Oh, God!

41:24.520 --> 41:26.454
Do not fight them!

41:27.823 --> 41:29.552
Oh, my God!

41:31.326 --> 41:35.319
-What's he doing? What's he doing?
-He's humping you, he's humping you!

41:35.497 --> 41:37.624
-What's he doing?
-Establish dominance!

41:37.833 --> 41:39.425
Establish dominance!

41:40.002 --> 41:41.902
Get him off of me!

41:43.839 --> 41:47.070
He's humping me!
Make him stop!

41:47.376 --> 41:49.241
The ears! Get the ears.

41:56.985 --> 41:58.850
-Who's that?
-It's the rebels.

41:59.021 --> 42:01.046
Don't worry, they're my friends.

42:03.726 --> 42:05.591
God bless you!

42:05.761 --> 42:07.456
Say hi.

42:07.796 --> 42:09.093
Hi.

42:30.486 --> 42:33.580
These are your friends, huh?
What, are you kidding me?

42:33.756 --> 42:36.452
I'm starting to Iong for a monkey
with a hard-on.

42:42.664 --> 42:46.122
Whatever happens,
just keep Iooking into his eyes.

42:46.335 --> 42:47.996
-Won't that offend him?
-No.

42:48.637 --> 42:52.073
Whatever you do, do not blink.
They're Iike grizzlies.

42:52.241 --> 42:54.402
Just shut up
and Iet me take care of this.

42:57.045 --> 43:03.314
We know you work for Hatcher.
Were you tracking us?!

43:03.485 --> 43:06.511
-He thinks we work for Hatcher.
-Well, tell him the truth.

43:07.122 --> 43:09.920
Fierce gaze. Fierce gaze.
Fierce gaze.

43:17.132 --> 43:22.092
Honorable host, unlike this man on my
Ieft, I do not work for that evil scum.

43:24.873 --> 43:30.743
Why does the giant stare at me without
respect? I will cut out his arrogant eyes!

43:30.913 --> 43:34.212
-What's he saying?
-Shut up. Just hold his gaze.

43:35.517 --> 43:39.749
He is Hatcher's assassin. Paid to hunt
all who oppose him, including me.

43:45.661 --> 43:48.858
Why do I get the feeling
you really suck at Portuguese?

43:50.599 --> 43:51.827
What did he say?!

43:52.668 --> 43:55.102
He says he pisses on your ancestors...

43:55.270 --> 43:57.966
...and that you would make
a very pretty bride!

44:01.443 --> 44:03.468
-What's going on?
-He wants to fight you.

44:03.645 --> 44:06.614
No. We're not fighting.
Tell him I don't want to fight.

44:08.450 --> 44:13.183
The assassin is a great warrior! Better
to shoot him now and get it over with!

44:13.355 --> 44:16.347
-We are not fighting.
-Don't worry, they're Iittle people.

44:16.525 --> 44:19.289
-What?
-You could take them. They're Iittle.

44:19.761 --> 44:21.592
You can win.

44:24.199 --> 44:26.167
Why do you want to fight? Why?

44:26.602 --> 44:28.570
I just want to get back to the airport.

44:28.770 --> 44:31.102
PIease. I just have to get home.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.540
Okay, hip-hop.

44:43.518 --> 44:45.952
I don't want to do this.
PIease. PIease.

44:46.121 --> 44:50.057
Travis, tell them one more time
I do not want to fight.

44:50.425 --> 44:53.292
I'd Iove to help you out,
buddy, but I don't think...

44:53.462 --> 44:55.692
...they're really Iistening
to me anymore.

44:57.733 --> 44:59.257
Heads up.

45:08.944 --> 45:11.640
That's okay! That is okay!

45:26.461 --> 45:28.895
Hey, Kansas cities!

45:31.600 --> 45:33.067
Don't do it.

45:42.911 --> 45:45.880
What is that?
It's Iike spinning Tarzan jujitsu!

45:51.029 --> 45:53.259
Speedy Iittle bastards, aren't they?

45:55.782 --> 45:57.545
Head's gotta stay up.

47:06.513 --> 47:08.879
I am not your enemy.

47:15.725 --> 47:17.124
Mariana?

47:29.639 --> 47:31.698
What are you doing here?

47:33.443 --> 47:36.105
Barmaid by day,
rebel Ieader by night.

47:36.880 --> 47:41.010
You are good! The whole time I was
working you, you were working me.

47:41.184 --> 47:43.448
I was hoping you might find
O Gato do Diabo.

47:43.720 --> 47:45.813
It couldn't have all been work.

47:45.989 --> 47:49.925
could it?
Man, that was some good work.

47:50.327 --> 47:52.192
What do you think, Travis?

47:52.729 --> 47:55.357
I knew. You know that, right?
I totally knew.

47:55.599 --> 47:57.396
Of course.

47:58.368 --> 48:00.029
Hey.

48:00.637 --> 48:03.401
The herbs will keep it
from getting infected.

48:09.880 --> 48:12.644
-Why do you do this?
-Pardon me?

48:13.016 --> 48:17.476
-Why do you fight?
-Because of 65 cents an hour.

48:17.988 --> 48:20.149
That's what Hatcher
pays the workers.

48:20.323 --> 48:22.484
But in order to mine,
you need tools.

48:22.659 --> 48:26.117
You need food, clothing,
a place to sleep.

48:26.930 --> 48:29.455
You have no money,
so, what do you do?

48:29.666 --> 48:31.600
You borrow from Hatcher.

48:32.068 --> 48:35.560
Pick and shovel, a dollar a day.

48:35.872 --> 48:38.340
A sack to haul the dirt,
another dollar.

48:38.508 --> 48:41.944
OId Mr. Beck knows a Iot
about debt, don't you?

48:42.212 --> 48:45.579
He knows what it's Iike to dig a hole
so deep you can't climb out.

48:45.749 --> 48:48.582
call it what you want.
It's escravidao.

48:48.752 --> 48:50.014
"SIavery."

48:50.187 --> 48:52.212
And we intend to stop it.

49:01.765 --> 49:05.633
Manito wants to know who would win
a fight between Tyson and AIi.

49:08.505 --> 49:09.938
AIi, hands down.

49:12.576 --> 49:14.942
He says, "What about
Tyson's power?"

49:15.111 --> 49:17.477
Shit. Tell him AIi
would've done to Tyson...

49:17.647 --> 49:19.478
...what he did to Foreman in Africa.

49:20.717 --> 49:22.981
Rumble. Rumble in the Jungle.

49:24.020 --> 49:25.578
Tell him AIi was too smart.

49:26.790 --> 49:29.520
Too smart, too fast.
Would've used his jabs. Bam, bam!

49:30.327 --> 49:32.022
Would've danced.

49:32.329 --> 49:33.887
Would've played with his mind.

49:34.064 --> 49:37.659
Before you know it, bam! Left
to the body. Bam! Right to the head.

49:39.069 --> 49:40.502
Down goes Tyson.

49:41.871 --> 49:43.668
FIoat Iike butterfly.

49:44.574 --> 49:46.474
Sting Iike bee.

49:48.178 --> 49:51.147
FIoat Iike butterfly, sting Iike bee.

49:51.314 --> 49:53.748
-Yeah!
-FIoat Iike butterfly, sting Iike a bee!

49:53.917 --> 49:58.081
-Yeah!
-FIoat Iike butterfly, sting Iike a bee!

50:18.074 --> 50:20.872
He says he thinks
you are a great fighter...

50:21.945 --> 50:23.503
...and he wants you to have it.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.944
-It's for Iuck.
-Tell him I'm sorry, I can't.

50:26.116 --> 50:29.210
You'II offend him if you refuse.

50:34.491 --> 50:36.516
I'm honored. Thank you.

50:40.563 --> 50:42.428
You'II need all the Iuck you can get.

50:42.832 --> 50:45.494
It's a Iong walk back to the airfield.

50:45.969 --> 50:47.834
Especially by yourself.

50:48.505 --> 50:49.972
Nice!

50:50.173 --> 50:51.902
You don't understand.

50:53.343 --> 50:56.107
-I'm not going back without him.
-Oh, here we go again.

50:56.346 --> 50:57.677
Fifty rifles say you are.

51:02.204 --> 51:04.804
And we're rebels, not thieves.

51:12.384 --> 51:13.914
Hatcher!

51:16.554 --> 51:18.494
Travis!

51:37.314 --> 51:39.104
Let's clean it up.

52:06.034 --> 52:07.734
Not so fast, jungle boy.

52:13.514 --> 52:15.174
Move! Move!

52:20.784 --> 52:22.274
come on!

52:31.764 --> 52:33.754
Manito!

52:35.764 --> 52:37.394
Go, go, go!

52:37.574 --> 52:39.264
-Manito!
-Let's go!

53:00.164 --> 53:02.124
I want hunting parties.

53:02.324 --> 53:03.954
Small ones.

53:04.134 --> 53:05.854
Find them.

53:06.034 --> 53:07.964
Find them!

54:12.734 --> 54:15.204
AII right, this is the way
it's going to be.

54:17.334 --> 54:20.324
You're going to take me
to O Gato do Diabo.

54:22.904 --> 54:25.434
-And you're going to take me now.
-calm down.

54:25.614 --> 54:29.204
Don't! You saw what they do.
Don't ever tell me to calm down.

54:29.384 --> 54:32.014
Travis, don't play with me.

54:32.184 --> 54:34.484
-Or what?
-Or I'm going to shoot you.

54:34.684 --> 54:37.624
Well, if you shoot me,
you're never gonna find the Gato.

54:38.094 --> 54:41.524
-So we're gonna make a Iittle deal.
-Deal?

54:41.764 --> 54:46.194
You see? O Gato is an object to you.
It's Iife on the Riviera, a private yacht.

54:46.364 --> 54:49.024
-You don't know anything about me.
-For us it's hope.

54:49.204 --> 54:51.364
My heart's breaking.
It's Iike a telethon.

54:51.534 --> 54:53.834
-You selfish--
-Enough!

54:54.004 --> 54:55.804
Sit down! Sit down!

54:55.974 --> 54:57.804
Holy shit, you tried to shoot me!

54:59.414 --> 55:01.174
You saw it!

55:01.644 --> 55:03.044
-crazy.
-Shut up.

55:03.214 --> 55:04.844
Shut up.

55:07.884 --> 55:09.984
The deal's this.
He takes you to the Gato.

55:10.194 --> 55:14.624
You just show me how I get out of this
jungle so I can take him home. Deal?

55:17.734 --> 55:20.754
Do we have a deal?

55:22.264 --> 55:25.324
-Deal.
-Let me get this straight.

55:25.504 --> 55:28.494
She gets what she needs,
you get what you need...

55:28.674 --> 55:32.074
-...and I get the shaft.
-I could always give her back the gun.

55:32.244 --> 55:35.774
-I really don't Iike you.
-Yeah, well, I get that a Iot.

55:35.944 --> 55:37.434
Seriously.

56:39.144 --> 56:40.574
What?

56:40.744 --> 56:43.714
I was just wondering
how it is you came to do...

56:43.884 --> 56:46.074
...you know, whatever it is you do.

56:48.154 --> 56:51.214
-It's a Iong story.
-It's a Iong walk.

56:53.154 --> 56:55.624
I grew up in a very rough place.

56:56.464 --> 56:58.724
One thing Ied to another, that's all.

56:59.864 --> 57:01.494
-Just Iike you.
-Like me?

57:01.664 --> 57:03.694
Yeah, you get pushed,
you push back.

57:03.874 --> 57:06.704
Well, with me, I pushed so hard
that word got around.

57:07.374 --> 57:10.434
Before I knew it, I was in a room
full of the wrong people...

57:10.614 --> 57:12.104
...with the wrong money.

57:12.374 --> 57:15.434
So you think I'm standing
in a room full of the wrong people?

57:15.614 --> 57:18.344
Yeah. Something Iike that.

57:18.784 --> 57:21.214
I Iike you, Mr. Beck.

57:21.754 --> 57:23.274
Really.

57:24.154 --> 57:26.354
But you and I are nothing alike.

57:28.694 --> 57:30.184
Travis!

57:30.394 --> 57:32.524
Let's keep moving. Let's go.

58:13.804 --> 58:15.504
What are you doing?

58:16.604 --> 58:19.374
Let's take us a Iittle swim,
Wolfgang.

58:21.844 --> 58:23.784
We're not swimming. Let's go.

58:23.954 --> 58:25.884
come on, big boy.
You could use a bath.

58:26.054 --> 58:28.784
Travis, we have to keep moving.
It'II be dark soon.

58:30.954 --> 58:32.324
Why?

58:32.494 --> 58:34.514
We're already here.

58:47.574 --> 58:49.044
-Don't pee in the water.
-Why?

58:49.204 --> 58:52.944
A candiru, a vicious parasite,
will swim up the urine into your pau.

58:53.614 --> 58:56.704
come on, big boy! It feels good!

58:58.054 --> 59:00.884
-Swim up my what?
-Your pinto.

59:01.454 --> 59:06.054
It'II swim up your ding-dong. And once
it gets in, you can't get it out.

59:07.124 --> 59:08.524
come on!

59:08.694 --> 59:10.324
Wait.

59:11.034 --> 59:12.724
Well, then what?

59:13.034 --> 59:14.824
They have to amputate.

59:24.214 --> 59:27.614
Not this boy's pinto. Not today.

59:53.304 --> 59:55.034
The hieroglyphic code...

59:55.204 --> 59:58.604
...said the great chief of the Marajo
people put the Gato to sleep...

59:58.774 --> 01:00:02.304
-...behind walls of a moving curtain.
-A waterfall.

01:00:22.734 --> 01:00:24.934
Must be some kind of
methane buildup.

01:00:29.844 --> 01:00:31.834
It's cool. Let's go.

01:00:45.254 --> 01:00:48.524
-Oh, God!
-Yeah, real genius.

01:00:48.694 --> 01:00:51.224
-You have no clue what you're doing.
-Oh, shut up!

01:00:51.434 --> 01:00:54.294
You obviously don't know
anything about methane deposits.

01:00:54.464 --> 01:00:57.234
-Oh, and you do?
-Shut up.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:59.734
What'd you just say?

01:01:31.774 --> 01:01:33.504
What is it?

01:01:40.484 --> 01:01:43.414
Why do I get the feeling
we are not supposed to be here?

01:01:44.554 --> 01:01:46.414
Because we're not.

01:01:56.624 --> 01:01:58.394
There it is! I told you it was real!

01:01:58.564 --> 01:02:02.024
Travis, you're never gonna get
back there. It's too dangerous.

01:02:05.374 --> 01:02:06.774
The roof is coming down!

01:02:07.274 --> 01:02:08.904
Wait a second.

01:02:10.874 --> 01:02:12.644
A jaguar.

01:02:15.684 --> 01:02:17.044
I know what this is.

01:02:17.214 --> 01:02:18.804
Monkey.

01:02:19.414 --> 01:02:21.044
Eagle.

01:02:21.254 --> 01:02:23.684
-I can't hold this, Travis.
-I know what this is.

01:02:23.854 --> 01:02:26.324
-What is it?
-It's an 800-year-old safe.

01:02:26.524 --> 01:02:28.994
This is how they kept
their treasures protected.

01:02:30.934 --> 01:02:32.324
There's a combination.

01:02:34.164 --> 01:02:38.224
Jaguar, cat. Gato, cat.
It's gotta be the jaguar.

01:02:38.404 --> 01:02:41.564
We pull the sticks closest
to the jaguar, we'II be okay.

01:02:41.744 --> 01:02:43.934
For 60 seconds,
then the roof's coming down.

01:02:44.114 --> 01:02:46.234
You're not gonna touch anything.
Let's go!

01:02:50.044 --> 01:02:51.714
AII right.

01:02:53.984 --> 01:02:55.854
Follow the jag.

01:02:56.084 --> 01:02:57.854
Follow the jaguar.

01:03:04.534 --> 01:03:07.264
Easy. Easy.

01:03:09.234 --> 01:03:10.824
It's coming down, Travis.

01:03:17.314 --> 01:03:19.334
What are you doing?
Let's go!

01:03:20.174 --> 01:03:21.574
Pass it to me.

01:03:27.524 --> 01:03:29.644
-Is that a jaguar?
-I think it's an eagle!

01:03:29.854 --> 01:03:31.514
Travis, hurry!

01:03:34.494 --> 01:03:36.424
Oh, my....

01:03:42.434 --> 01:03:44.764
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:03:52.344 --> 01:03:53.974
I did it.

01:03:54.514 --> 01:03:56.244
I found you.

01:03:56.944 --> 01:04:00.614
Not some Oxford archaeologist
or some stiff-ass Harvard professor.

01:04:00.784 --> 01:04:03.584
-I did it! I found you!
-Who gives a shit?

01:04:03.784 --> 01:04:06.124
How you Iike me now, huh, Beck?

01:04:08.994 --> 01:04:10.514
Go! Go! Move! Now!

01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:12.654
Run!

01:04:15.504 --> 01:04:17.164
Let's go!

01:04:17.334 --> 01:04:18.564
Move!

01:04:33.784 --> 01:04:35.914
These are konlabos.

01:04:36.584 --> 01:04:38.254
They're very rare.

01:04:38.454 --> 01:04:39.654
You're Iucky.

01:04:45.634 --> 01:04:49.194
And I wouldn't flirt with O Gato
do Diabo's eyes if I were you.

01:04:49.364 --> 01:04:51.894
-They say it's dangerous.
-What else do they say?

01:04:52.074 --> 01:04:55.764
Once restored to its rightful owners,
the rivers will be Iaden with fish.

01:04:55.944 --> 01:04:58.914
And the trees will grow tall,
bringing shade for hammocks...

01:04:59.074 --> 01:05:01.044
...so its people may rest their backs.

01:05:01.214 --> 01:05:03.734
You think bringing this Gato
will do all that?

01:05:03.914 --> 01:05:07.754
No, Mr. Beck. But I expect the money
selling it brings will do just that.

01:05:07.924 --> 01:05:11.684
We can buy seed, irrigate.
Farm our own Iands.

01:05:11.894 --> 01:05:13.954
Free ourselves from Hatcher's mine.

01:05:16.024 --> 01:05:19.124
When that statue hits the black
market, it'II vanish forever.

01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:20.924
It's a Iittle Iate for morals.

01:05:21.104 --> 01:05:23.864
Especially after you were going
to do the same thing.

01:05:24.034 --> 01:05:27.094
And 1 0 percent of that is going
to pay for your freedom...

01:05:27.274 --> 01:05:30.364
...so I'd be a Iittle more grateful
if I were you.

01:05:31.814 --> 01:05:34.784
What if I told you I was gonna
give it to a museum...

01:05:34.944 --> 01:05:37.044
...so the whole world
could appreciate it?

01:05:37.484 --> 01:05:41.744
You can tell me anything you want,
Travis, but I know you.

01:05:47.624 --> 01:05:50.094
What are you going to do
after you bring him home?

01:05:50.294 --> 01:05:54.094
-I'm gonna open a restaurant.
-Yeah. He's a killer in the kitchen too.

01:05:54.264 --> 01:05:56.664
Ten, 1 5 tables. Nothing fancy.

01:05:57.574 --> 01:06:00.804
Italian. Southern Italian.

01:06:21.464 --> 01:06:23.424
How do you...?

01:06:26.134 --> 01:06:29.464
How do you...? How do you spell...

01:06:31.034 --> 01:06:32.974
...konlabos?

01:06:34.504 --> 01:06:37.844
Konlabos, with a K.

01:06:38.314 --> 01:06:42.444
Don't worry. After four or five hours,
you'II be as good as new.

01:06:45.684 --> 01:06:48.744
The fire will keep the animals away
until sunup.

01:06:51.194 --> 01:06:52.814
I'm sorry...

01:06:53.024 --> 01:06:55.994
...but money has a way
of changing people.

01:06:56.694 --> 01:06:58.124
You did find it, Travis.

01:06:58.964 --> 01:07:01.094
Just Iike you said.

01:07:02.404 --> 01:07:05.024
No one can take that
away from you.

01:07:12.744 --> 01:07:14.574
And I will send you the money...

01:07:14.744 --> 01:07:16.474
...buy your freedom. I meant that.

01:07:20.284 --> 01:07:23.154
You kept your word,
and I admire that...

01:07:23.484 --> 01:07:25.384
...so I'II keep mine.

01:07:25.554 --> 01:07:27.654
Go north until you reach
the Quantana Road.

01:07:27.864 --> 01:07:30.354
Take it south
all the way to the airfield.

01:07:30.564 --> 01:07:32.494
Good Iuck to you, Mr. Beck.

01:08:36.694 --> 01:08:38.163
Oh, shit.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:40.834
What? What?

01:08:46.004 --> 01:08:48.944
-What?
-Monkey. Monkey.

01:08:49.104 --> 01:08:51.163
Monkey? Where?
Just get him away from me.

01:08:51.344 --> 01:08:53.814
-Get out of here.
-Get out of here.

01:08:53.974 --> 01:08:55.814
Get out of here, monkey!

01:08:57.243 --> 01:08:59.184
Oh, no.

01:08:59.354 --> 01:09:01.413
-I hate this place.
-Get out of here!

01:09:01.584 --> 01:09:05.884
I hate penis-eating minnows,
and I hate freaky fruit.

01:09:07.054 --> 01:09:10.394
-Get them away from me.
-I wanna go home. I want concrete.

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:13.993
-Get out of here, monkey.
-I want homemade tortellini.

01:09:14.234 --> 01:09:16.533
I want my Los Angeles Lakers.

01:09:16.863 --> 01:09:20.323
That's what I want. I want to go home.
I want to go home.

01:09:21.344 --> 01:09:24.334
I want to go home!

01:09:25.374 --> 01:09:28.544
Get out of here, monkey.
Get out of here, monkey.

01:09:47.634 --> 01:09:49.764
Well, what about that?

01:09:53.573 --> 01:09:56.334
-Been for a stroll, have you, boys?
-Where's my bag?

01:09:56.504 --> 01:09:58.564
Where's my jeep?

01:09:58.744 --> 01:10:00.714
Give me my bag.

01:10:10.324 --> 01:10:11.784
You have any water?

01:10:20.264 --> 01:10:23.534
Sit down. How soon
before we can take off?

01:10:23.704 --> 01:10:26.364
You Ieft a jeep at the bottom
of a mountainside.

01:10:26.534 --> 01:10:29.004
-I'II take care of it.
-In a bloody Iarge puddle.

01:10:29.174 --> 01:10:32.634
-I said, I'II take care of it.
-That jeep is dead, my friend.

01:10:33.174 --> 01:10:34.874
Look, you'II get your money.

01:10:35.044 --> 01:10:37.344
-Just start the plane.
-What's your big hurry?

01:10:37.514 --> 01:10:40.784
I'm trying to Ieave before I run
into Hatcher or more problems.

01:10:40.954 --> 01:10:42.644
Don't go worrying about Hatcher.

01:10:43.084 --> 01:10:46.084
That monstrosity
won't give a flying fornication...

01:10:46.294 --> 01:10:49.264
...for the pair of youse no more.
He got what he was after.

01:10:49.424 --> 01:10:50.984
What do you mean?

01:10:51.194 --> 01:10:53.794
He caught up with poor Mariana
in the jungle.

01:10:53.964 --> 01:10:56.024
He relieved her of her artifact.

01:10:56.734 --> 01:11:01.194
-What'd you say?
-I said, he relieved her of her artifact.

01:11:01.374 --> 01:11:04.464
It's a word in the English Ianguage.
"Artifact." Look it up.

01:11:04.644 --> 01:11:07.974
Son of a bitch. He's got my Gato!

01:11:08.144 --> 01:11:12.084
-Your what?
-The Gato. Don't you speak English?

01:11:12.784 --> 01:11:15.614
-Hey. Where is she?
-Hatcher's got her in town.

01:11:15.884 --> 01:11:18.754
-He's torturing her for information.
-He's doing what?

01:11:20.794 --> 01:11:23.154
Freedom fighters?
Freedom fighters, my ass.

01:11:23.324 --> 01:11:26.324
Lutadores de Louco, you ask me.

01:11:26.494 --> 01:11:28.594
They're all gonna die.

01:11:28.764 --> 01:11:30.794
come on. AII aboard.

01:12:01.864 --> 01:12:03.454
come on.

01:12:04.304 --> 01:12:06.134
What are you doing?

01:12:09.074 --> 01:12:12.134
-We made a deal.
-A deal?

01:12:13.274 --> 01:12:14.934
What the hell does that mean?

01:12:15.114 --> 01:12:17.704
I'm here at the airstrip,
she doesn't have the Gato.

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:20.014
Gonna go in there by yourself?

01:12:21.624 --> 01:12:24.314
No way. No way.

01:12:24.524 --> 01:12:26.614
Hey, Hatcher's got a small army
back there.

01:12:26.824 --> 01:12:28.794
You don't know your way
around the town.

01:12:28.994 --> 01:12:30.514
Oh, wait. I got an idea.

01:12:30.824 --> 01:12:32.724
Saddle up to one of those bulls...

01:12:32.894 --> 01:12:37.394
...ride into town Iike a conquistador
and challenge all of them to a duel.

01:12:37.674 --> 01:12:40.604
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:42.834
You don't use guns.

01:12:43.004 --> 01:12:45.474
-What's your point?
-You're gonna die, Beck.

01:12:45.644 --> 01:12:48.514
The boy's right.
You mind if we settle the bill now?

01:12:48.684 --> 01:12:50.174
You need help.

01:12:50.344 --> 01:12:53.514
Are you gonna help me, Travis?
AII you care about is the money.

01:12:53.684 --> 01:12:55.344
No, Beck, you're wrong.

01:12:55.554 --> 01:12:58.684
I'd rather die than Iet that
son of a bitch get my Gato.

01:12:58.894 --> 01:13:02.694
You need all the help you can get.
You can even use him, for chrissake.

01:13:02.864 --> 01:13:05.724
Don't bring me into it.
I got a dodgy knee here.

01:13:07.394 --> 01:13:09.924
You can't do this on your own.

01:13:18.674 --> 01:13:20.904
Okay, Travis.

01:13:22.244 --> 01:13:24.304
I know you're gonna run on me.

01:13:24.484 --> 01:13:26.384
Might not be tonight or tomorrow.

01:13:26.714 --> 01:13:30.454
But I will find you,
and I will take you back.

01:13:31.994 --> 01:13:34.584
-Are we clear?
-Yeah.

01:13:34.794 --> 01:13:37.764
We'II both probably be dead
in about an hour.

01:13:37.934 --> 01:13:39.894
So Iet's cancel christmas.

01:13:50.144 --> 01:13:52.734
Your plan of attack was a bit naive.

01:13:53.814 --> 01:13:56.244
Man, if I was only
1 0 minutes younger, huh?

01:13:57.244 --> 01:14:00.944
I suppose now we have a conversation
where you enlighten me.

01:14:01.124 --> 01:14:02.344
Mr. Hatcher.

01:14:02.554 --> 01:14:05.544
How many more of you are out there?
Enlighten me.

01:14:05.754 --> 01:14:08.244
Where are the rest of your
compadres? Enlighten me!

01:14:08.464 --> 01:14:09.684
Mr. Hatcher.

01:14:09.864 --> 01:14:12.264
I don't get why you people
are so hostile.

01:14:12.434 --> 01:14:14.924
I've been good to you.
I built you a town.

01:14:15.104 --> 01:14:16.324
Why are we fighting?

01:14:16.504 --> 01:14:17.834
-Mr. Hatcher.
-What?

01:14:18.004 --> 01:14:20.934
We've Iost contact
with Outpost 1.

01:14:23.044 --> 01:14:24.734
There's nobody answering.

01:14:29.584 --> 01:14:33.514
-Mr. Hatcher, are you out there?
-What can I do for you, Mr. Beck?

01:14:33.684 --> 01:14:36.014
I have no desire to fight
with you or your men.

01:14:36.454 --> 01:14:38.384
For that reason,
you have two options.

01:14:38.554 --> 01:14:41.584
Option A, you leave the Gato
and the girl...

01:14:41.794 --> 01:14:44.284
...and you walk out of town,
no questions asked.

01:14:44.494 --> 01:14:47.594
-What's option B?
-Option B...

01:14:47.764 --> 01:14:49.564
...I make you.

01:15:02.244 --> 01:15:04.144
Wrong choice.

01:15:10.484 --> 01:15:12.454
Lock down the town.

01:16:15.924 --> 01:16:19.784
Still no visual contact. Team two
is checking the perimeter right now.

01:17:04.774 --> 01:17:06.364
He...

01:17:06.534 --> 01:17:10.064
...that heard the sound
of thy holy trumpet...

01:17:10.244 --> 01:17:12.304
...and took not warning...

01:17:12.674 --> 01:17:16.404
...he hath clearly wandered too far...

01:17:16.584 --> 01:17:18.204
...from the word of God.

01:17:18.514 --> 01:17:21.544
And cornelius Bernard Hatcher...

01:17:21.854 --> 01:17:26.484
...your heir has come.
Let's get it on, big boy!

01:17:26.694 --> 01:17:30.214
It's time to get back on the path.

01:18:29.154 --> 01:18:30.554
That's a Iot of cows.

01:18:39.094 --> 01:18:40.494
Hi.

01:18:56.544 --> 01:18:57.844
What nerve.

01:19:22.104 --> 01:19:23.474
About bloody time, huh?

01:19:26.474 --> 01:19:28.344
Somebody just shoot him.

01:19:55.414 --> 01:19:57.464
Oh, yeah? Oh, you want one?

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:01.174
Oh, okay.

01:20:01.344 --> 01:20:05.254
A Iittle thunder? Huh?
You Iike thunderstorms, big boy?

01:20:06.054 --> 01:20:07.524
How about some Iightning?

01:20:14.594 --> 01:20:19.294
Ear, ear-- Ears, eyes, foot, face!

01:20:26.004 --> 01:20:29.414
Take the Gato and the girl
and get to the airfield.

01:20:29.574 --> 01:20:32.374
If you run into trouble,
use her as a hostage.

01:20:32.544 --> 01:20:35.214
And Harvey,
when you're safely out of town...

01:20:35.384 --> 01:20:38.184
...put her out of my misery.

01:21:10.084 --> 01:21:11.414
I need help!

01:21:16.804 --> 01:21:19.434
Do not go gentle
into that good night, my Iovely.

01:21:21.304 --> 01:21:23.964
Beck! I need help. Beck!

01:21:24.244 --> 01:21:25.934
Rage, rage...

01:21:28.444 --> 01:21:30.274
...against the dying of the Iight.

01:21:34.114 --> 01:21:36.584
There shall be no mercy...

01:21:39.924 --> 01:21:42.124
...for any force that stands...

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:48.224
...blocking this path
of his righteousness.

01:21:52.404 --> 01:21:54.234
Beck, help!

01:21:56.404 --> 01:21:57.934
£¨¡­£©

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:04.584
Help!

01:22:43.184 --> 01:22:44.884
Move!

01:23:24.864 --> 01:23:27.024
No way.

01:23:39.244 --> 01:23:41.444
Give me back my Gato,
you Iittle bald freak!

01:24:37.574 --> 01:24:38.834
Oh, great.

01:26:12.844 --> 01:26:14.814
See you.

01:26:14.984 --> 01:26:17.004
You got the moves.

01:26:17.184 --> 01:26:18.584
I'II give you that.

01:26:27.494 --> 01:26:32.364
You reached into the wrong
refrigerator, Mr. Beck.

01:26:44.004 --> 01:26:45.974
Hold your horses.

01:26:46.144 --> 01:26:48.134
What have I done?

01:26:49.714 --> 01:26:51.474
Are we not men?

01:26:52.384 --> 01:26:54.144
-Hatcher.
-What?

01:26:54.314 --> 01:26:58.014
Option A is still on the table.
You can walk away right now.

01:26:59.254 --> 01:27:01.694
Option A doesn't work for me.

01:27:02.724 --> 01:27:06.754
Before I came here,
what did you people have?

01:27:07.094 --> 01:27:08.584
Face it. Be fair.

01:27:09.064 --> 01:27:11.694
I put a roof over your head,
coin in your pockets.

01:27:11.874 --> 01:27:15.934
You barefoot Indians
didn't have pockets...

01:27:16.104 --> 01:27:19.504
...before Hatcher came along.

01:27:19.844 --> 01:27:23.444
I gave you a Iife!
I'm the heart in the darkness.

01:27:23.614 --> 01:27:25.204
Face it...

01:27:25.384 --> 01:27:27.974
...you can't run this thing
without me.

01:27:28.154 --> 01:27:32.054
I am pumping the blood
of the modern world...

01:27:32.254 --> 01:27:34.384
...into your backward veins...

01:27:34.594 --> 01:27:36.754
...you stinking...

01:27:38.794 --> 01:27:40.024
...ingrate...

01:27:41.364 --> 01:27:43.854
...Oompa Loompa...

01:27:44.034 --> 01:27:46.234
...morons!

01:27:49.944 --> 01:27:51.734
Okay.

01:27:51.914 --> 01:27:53.874
That's it, I'm done.

01:28:01.424 --> 01:28:03.324
Mr. Beck...

01:28:05.454 --> 01:28:08.054
...I'II take option A.

01:28:10.294 --> 01:28:12.264
clear, please.

01:28:37.924 --> 01:28:39.184
Oh, shit.

01:28:53.874 --> 01:28:56.704
You make a hell of an entrance,
Mr. Beck.

01:28:58.474 --> 01:29:00.104
Yeah.

01:29:05.614 --> 01:29:08.914
I'd offer you a beer,
but I think you blew up my bar.

01:29:09.724 --> 01:29:11.714
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:29:13.954 --> 01:29:15.554
Thank you.

01:29:17.064 --> 01:29:20.194
-We had a deal.
-Yes, we did.

01:29:20.594 --> 01:29:23.394
And I'm afraid I didn't deliver
on that deal.

01:29:24.134 --> 01:29:25.934
How is that?

01:29:27.834 --> 01:29:29.734
The Gato.

01:29:29.844 --> 01:29:32.174
I promised you the Gato.

01:29:33.044 --> 01:29:35.444
Yes, well, I promised you Travis.

01:29:35.614 --> 01:29:38.514
You all talking about this Travis?

01:29:39.414 --> 01:29:41.384
And this Gato?

01:29:53.434 --> 01:29:54.664
I'm impressed.

01:29:54.834 --> 01:29:57.304
Yeah, well, make sure
they spell my name right.

01:30:00.074 --> 01:30:02.434
I told you it wasn't about the money.

01:30:04.714 --> 01:30:06.474
Well, big boy...

01:30:06.644 --> 01:30:08.614
...I guess it's your move.

01:30:19.824 --> 01:30:21.694
I'm impressed myself, Travis.

01:30:26.764 --> 01:30:29.464
Declan, start the plane.

01:30:29.934 --> 01:30:33.304
"Declan, start the plane"?
What does that mean?

01:30:33.474 --> 01:30:35.594
-I'm taking you home.
-Oh, I figured that.

01:30:35.874 --> 01:30:37.564
No breaks. Good Iuck.

01:30:37.744 --> 01:30:39.374
You too.

01:30:40.414 --> 01:30:42.534
I will send you your cut.

01:30:43.284 --> 01:30:45.144
Move.

01:30:46.484 --> 01:30:50.044
-Not a penny Iess than 1 5.6 million.
-Move, Travis.

01:30:50.254 --> 01:30:52.224
You really ought
to stay away from guns.

01:30:52.424 --> 01:30:56.014
You ought to get yourself
a psychiatrist. Seriously.

01:31:48.684 --> 01:31:50.304
Move.

01:31:55.184 --> 01:31:56.814
Well, Iook at him.

01:31:57.024 --> 01:32:00.514
Look at you. Your beard.
You're Iike a real man.

01:32:00.724 --> 01:32:03.124
-But you're so thin.
-Running is good exercise.

01:32:03.294 --> 01:32:05.694
Good exercise. That's funny.
Did you hear him?

01:32:06.034 --> 01:32:07.294
Running for your Iife.

01:32:08.604 --> 01:32:10.564
I Iove it. I really do!

01:32:13.334 --> 01:32:15.934
You know there's not
enough aspirin in the world...

01:32:16.104 --> 01:32:18.804
-...for a headache Iike you?
-Well, there probably is.

01:32:18.974 --> 01:32:21.674
-But I understand what you mean.
-Well, that's good.

01:32:21.844 --> 01:32:25.944
Because that means you'II understand
why you'II take that trip to chicago.

01:32:26.114 --> 01:32:28.714
Actually, I don't completely
understand that one.

01:32:28.884 --> 01:32:31.914
-Still the smart-ass.
-I'm not that smart, Dad.

01:32:32.124 --> 01:32:35.184
-I didn't know she was married.
-Well, she was.

01:32:35.924 --> 01:32:37.894
Very married.

01:32:38.594 --> 01:32:40.624
And you. What took you
so Iong, huh?

01:32:40.794 --> 01:32:43.354
Your kid was
a tough rundown, Billy.

01:32:43.964 --> 01:32:47.024
-Him? No.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:32:47.204 --> 01:32:50.534
But I did walk him right through
that door, right? Like we agreed?

01:32:50.704 --> 01:32:52.544
-You did.
-We good?

01:32:54.044 --> 01:32:56.804
We're good.
Two hundred and fifty Iarge.

01:32:57.144 --> 01:32:58.774
You got your restaurant, kid.

01:32:59.384 --> 01:33:00.784
Now get out of here, huh?

01:33:03.524 --> 01:33:04.584
Before I Ieave....

01:33:04.954 --> 01:33:08.084
When I was in Brazil, they
showed me this ritual they do...

01:33:08.294 --> 01:33:10.054
...when they have big celebrations.

01:33:10.224 --> 01:33:16.134
What they do is, they eat this fruit,
and it's called konlabos, with a K.

01:33:17.934 --> 01:33:22.164
So I figured before I Ieave,
we could celebrate one Iast time.

01:33:22.344 --> 01:33:24.174
come on, guys. Try some of this.

01:33:24.344 --> 01:33:27.504
If he says it's good, it's gotta be.
He's the best chef I know.

01:33:27.674 --> 01:33:30.474
Billy, here, you try the first piece.

01:33:31.584 --> 01:33:32.814
Not bad.

01:33:33.354 --> 01:33:36.754
Big seeds, though.
I don't Iike seeds.

01:33:40.254 --> 01:33:41.914
Hey, what are you--?

01:34:00.144 --> 01:34:02.574
I walked him right through
that door, Billy.

01:34:07.854 --> 01:34:09.514
Boy...

01:34:11.224 --> 01:34:13.194
...you got a funny-Iooking face.

01:34:13.824 --> 01:34:15.554
Hey, Dad.

01:34:18.994 --> 01:34:19.134
I Iove you, you know that?

01:34:19.134 --> 01:34:20.524
I Iove you, you know that?

01:34:20.694 --> 01:34:22.924
Because you showed me
something back there.

01:34:23.104 --> 01:34:26.834
I thought you had character,
but I wasn't sure.

01:34:27.004 --> 01:34:29.764
-You got it, man. You really got it!
-Get in the truck.

01:34:29.874 --> 01:34:33.814
-You violated every agricultural Iaw.
-That's the Ieast of my problems.

01:34:33.974 --> 01:34:36.414
We should go back
in there and finish him off.

01:34:36.584 --> 01:34:38.104
You want to go back, go ahead.

01:34:38.284 --> 01:34:41.484
-Knock yourself out. I'II wait for you.
-I'm not going back.

01:34:41.654 --> 01:34:45.644
Right. So shut up, get in the truck
before I change my mind.

01:34:45.854 --> 01:34:47.184
Don't push me.

01:34:48.264 --> 01:34:49.984
-What?
-Don't push me.

01:34:50.164 --> 01:34:52.124
I appreciate everything you did.

01:34:52.334 --> 01:34:56.464
If you want to get technical, all you did
is even the score. I saved you first.

01:34:56.664 --> 01:34:58.494
-Get in.
-You don't have to thank me.

01:34:58.674 --> 01:35:01.864
But this pushing shit ain't
happening no more. You read me?

01:35:05.014 --> 01:35:08.504
Okay. I'm gonna bust you up.

01:35:08.914 --> 01:35:10.674
Go for it.

01:35:11.814 --> 01:35:13.684
Yeah.

01:35:15.454 --> 01:35:18.784
Hey, remember your friend
Mr. Thunder?

01:35:18.994 --> 01:35:21.454
How about his buddy
Mr. Lightning?

01:35:22.794 --> 01:35:25.264
I know you know him.

01:35:25.434 --> 01:35:28.194
You know him real well, don't you?

01:35:39.644 --> 01:35:42.444
I'm just playing, man.
I'II be in the truck.

01:35:46.784 --> 01:35:48.014
I'm gonna kill you.
