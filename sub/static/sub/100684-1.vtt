20:29.619 --> 20:30.838
Is that a real thing?

20:30.881 --> 20:32.318
Apparently.

20:32.361 --> 20:35.016
I only left, like,
12 hours early.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.191
Yeah, well, that 12 hours

20:36.235 --> 20:38.193
is about to cost us $50,000

20:38.237 --> 20:41.240
unless you get your butt
to the hospital this instant.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.198
Can I go a little later?

20:43.242 --> 20:47.202
Oh, did I interruptyour busy day of doing nothing?

20:47.246 --> 20:48.682
The doctor leaves
in half an hour.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.684
Get there right now!

20:50.727 --> 20:52.686
Okay, Mom. Bye. Fine.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.688
This is so stupid.
Apparently, you can't just

20:54.731 --> 20:56.255
leave the hospital
whenever you want.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.865
Yeah. We heard,
she was screaming.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.214
Okay, well, now we have
to stop by the hospital

20:59.258 --> 21:00.302
on the way to the station.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.304
[grunts]No, Murphy,you just go.

21:02.348 --> 21:05.046
Felix and I willtake care of the cops.Mm.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.048
No, I'm gonna go with you guys.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.702
You had a gun to your headtoday because of us.

21:08.745 --> 21:11.052
I'm not gonna waitanother hour. Felix?

21:11.095 --> 21:12.749
Yeah. Great.Thank you.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.403
Okay.Come on, Pretzel.

21:14.447 --> 21:19.234
I'm gonna call you an Uber and
I will see you at home. Here.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.931
Hey. Come here.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.719
Make sure they protect
you guys, okay?

21:25.762 --> 21:27.242
Okay.
Be careful.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.243
I will.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.593
I love you.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.689
Hey, how's he doing?

21:39.733 --> 21:41.996
Alert. Good. I thinka little freaked out.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.345
I haven't taken
his statement yet.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.912
Thought you'd want
to handle that yourself.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.392
But you did take
the woman's, right?

21:46.435 --> 21:48.655
Yeah, she's says she's gota recording of him confessing

21:48.698 --> 21:51.266
to the murder of her friend,
Tyson Parker.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.096
Here's her phone
and her cloud login.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.620
Thanks.She gave consent to access it.

21:57.664 --> 22:00.841
I'll take it from here.You got it, Chief.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.760
[siren wailing]

22:23.167 --> 22:26.780
Where is it?

22:26.823 --> 22:28.999
[muttering]:
Where is my phone?

22:29.043 --> 22:31.350
Ah!

22:31.393 --> 22:33.352
[sirens wailing]

22:43.492 --> 22:45.320
I need to talk to the police.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.843
PARAMEDIC:You're gonna be fine.

22:46.887 --> 22:50.238
[indistinct radio chatter]I need...

22:50.281 --> 22:51.979
I need to talk to the police.

23:17.091 --> 23:19.049
Who's smoking?

23:19.093 --> 23:21.138
Who's-who's smoking?
Can I bum one?

23:21.182 --> 23:23.184
Sure.

23:30.452 --> 23:33.455
Can I get a light, too?[lighter clicks]

23:39.330 --> 23:41.332
Thank you.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.780
It's just one, Pretzel. Shut up.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.448
I just heardthe recording.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.060
What were youthinking?

24:13.103 --> 24:16.977
Look, that-that was taken
way out of context.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.979
You know me. You...

24:19.022 --> 24:21.372
You know I'm not capable
of something like this.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.853
I've worked for the city
for 20 years.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.376
I've put my life on the line.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.248
That's your job.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.902
Look, it was self-defense.

24:28.945 --> 24:31.382
I don't care what it was.
Do you know the media circus

24:31.426 --> 24:32.993
that's gonna hit
when this gets out?

24:33.036 --> 24:35.386
And I'm gonna be the one
in front of those cameras.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.388
I'm sorry.

24:37.432 --> 24:40.522
This all happened on my watch,and there is no way that Simmons

24:40.566 --> 24:42.785
doesn't shank me
to try to save face.

24:42.829 --> 24:46.441
Is the recording the only pieceof evidence? Don't lie to me.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.270
That's it. There's nothing else.Great. This case

24:49.313 --> 24:51.881
won't even make it to trial,which, optically, is even worse.

24:51.925 --> 24:54.275
What do you mean?

24:54.318 --> 24:56.495
I'm guessing you didn't consentto being recorded?

24:56.538 --> 24:59.323
In Illinois, you have to consentfor anything to be admissible.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.543
So the whole country
is just gonna watch you

25:01.587 --> 25:03.327
get away with it.

25:03.371 --> 25:04.459
I'm finished.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.506
So the recording
isn't admissible?

25:10.204 --> 25:12.467
Then what's the point of puttingany of this out there?

25:12.511 --> 25:14.425
Riley, come on,
you want me to bury this?

25:14.469 --> 25:16.602
You got to be kidding me.No, no.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.473
I...

25:18.517 --> 25:22.303
Look, I feel terrible.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.523
I want a chance
to make this right.

25:24.566 --> 25:27.395
How can you possiblymake this right?

25:28.962 --> 25:31.355
By stopping
Nia Bailey.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.967
She's the real person
responsible

25:34.010 --> 25:36.056
for the death of Tyson Parker.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.579
That kid didn't
stand a chance.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.321
She had him dealing drugs
for her when he was 15.

25:40.364 --> 25:41.670
We stop her,

25:41.714 --> 25:43.454
we stop thousands of kids
who are gonna end up

25:43.498 --> 25:46.370
just like Tyson. That is
what this department needs.

25:46.414 --> 25:49.504
We've arrested Nia before,
the charges never stick.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.289
I am one of the few people
that Nia trusted.

25:52.333 --> 25:55.510
I have information on her
that no one else we work with

25:55.554 --> 25:57.860
would ever be able to get.

25:57.904 --> 26:00.515
And, Chief,
she's gonna keep doing this.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.082
She will continue

26:02.125 --> 26:05.607
flipping good cops and-and
outsmarting us at every turn.

26:05.651 --> 26:08.479
Meanwhile, she's got
teenagers selling heroin

26:08.523 --> 26:10.003
to other teenagers.

26:10.046 --> 26:13.397
Nia Bailey needs to be stopped.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.922
And I promise you,if you let me come back to work,

26:15.965 --> 26:18.577
I will deliver her.

26:25.061 --> 26:26.410
Wipe the girl's phone.

26:28.499 --> 26:31.546
As far as I'm concerned, nothingwas on there when I got here.

26:33.374 --> 26:34.636
Thank you.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.030
Just get me Nia Bailey.

26:47.344 --> 26:49.912
Hey, we need to drop the chargeson Darnell James.

26:49.956 --> 26:53.481
He's got a solid alibi.
Yeah, we messed up.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.570
I know. Sorry about this.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.660
[long inhale, exhales]

26:58.704 --> 27:00.053
Deep breath.

27:00.096 --> 27:02.446
[inhales, exhales]

27:02.490 --> 27:04.623
Good. Again.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.451
[inhales, exhales]

27:07.495 --> 27:09.628
Very good. Again.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.934
[inhales, exhales]

27:11.978 --> 27:14.241
Good. Again.I think you got it.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.982
One more time,please.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.723
[inhales]

27:17.766 --> 27:21.727
Very good. Okay,everything looks great.

27:21.770 --> 27:25.948
Nowyou can go.Check out out front.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.211
Thanks. This was all
very necessary.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.653
Thanks.

27:40.702 --> 27:43.705
Do you know if Dean Riley
is out of questioning yet?

27:43.749 --> 27:45.620
Sorry?

27:45.664 --> 27:49.145
Uh, he's a, he's a patient
here and he was arrested,

27:49.189 --> 27:51.278
so they weren't gonna let
anyone talk to him

27:51.321 --> 27:52.627
until he was out
of questioning.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.629
I can check.Dean Riley?

27:54.673 --> 27:57.023
Yeah.

27:58.764 --> 28:02.028
Uh, you said
he was arrested?Yeah.

28:02.071 --> 28:03.638
I don't see that here.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.509
He's being treated
as a normal patient.

28:07.381 --> 28:09.383
What?

28:16.825 --> 28:18.522
Hey.

28:29.359 --> 28:31.318
Get out of my room
or I'm calling security.

28:31.361 --> 28:33.581
Where did the cops go? You'resupposed to be in custody.

28:33.624 --> 28:35.104
That was
a misunderstanding.

28:35.148 --> 28:36.671
A misunderstanding?

28:36.715 --> 28:39.500
This is impossible. I need,
I need to speak to someone.

28:39.543 --> 28:40.893
Maybe I should
speak with someone.

28:40.936 --> 28:43.025
You assaulted me,
and then you tried to kill me,

28:43.069 --> 28:44.723
and then you lied
to the police about it.

28:44.766 --> 28:47.073
That's what you said?
You said that Ilied?

28:47.116 --> 28:49.771
You lied to meevery single day

28:49.815 --> 28:51.686
since the day I met you,
every single day,

28:51.730 --> 28:53.732
and you continue to lie.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.560
You tricked me into believing
that you cared about me.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.649
And you killed my best friend.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.347
Get the hell
out of my room.

29:00.390 --> 29:03.350
No. Why are you not

29:03.393 --> 29:05.787
in custody?
Why are you not in custody?

29:05.831 --> 29:07.658
I don't need to explain
myself to you.

29:07.702 --> 29:09.399
I've cleared it up
with the chief already.

29:09.443 --> 29:13.664
[scoffs] You actually thinkyou're gonna get away with this?

29:13.708 --> 29:16.537
Murphy, there's nothing to getaway with. I didn't do anything.

29:16.580 --> 29:20.193
I have you on tape.
It was in the cloud.

29:20.236 --> 29:21.803
I got it off my phone.

29:21.847 --> 29:25.764
Hm. Where's your phone now?

29:28.201 --> 29:30.377
I gave it to the cops.

29:30.420 --> 29:31.682
Right.

29:31.726 --> 29:35.643
Well, that would be me.

29:35.686 --> 29:37.688
Oh, my God.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.823
Oh, my God.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.738
I...

29:43.782 --> 29:45.218
Find outside, Pretzel.

29:45.261 --> 29:47.742
Go.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.662
What is taking so long?

29:54.705 --> 29:56.664
Hmm, I don't know. Maybe
they have actual emergencies.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.709
I said this was an emergency.

29:58.753 --> 30:01.582
I'm gonna go seewhat's going on.

30:03.627 --> 30:06.282
Hi. Um, I'm just checking in.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.380
Is there another route?No, ma'am.

30:17.424 --> 30:19.774
All right, can you,can you, uh, hurry?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.471
What do you
want me to do?

30:21.515 --> 30:23.865
How far away are we?Three blocks.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.867
Okay, I'm just,

30:25.911 --> 30:29.436
I'm just gonna walk.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.438
That's too much.Yeah, well, keep it.

30:31.481 --> 30:34.310
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

30:36.356 --> 30:39.881
Hey, guys.
I can take you back now.

30:39.925 --> 30:42.797
Great. Okay. Thank you.No problem.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.852
All right.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.204
Okay.What's so important?

31:00.467 --> 31:02.512
Mm...

31:08.388 --> 31:09.868
What's this?

31:12.218 --> 31:16.483
Okay, uh, so,
the other day, we, um...

31:16.526 --> 31:17.832
MURPHY:Hi.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.835
Uh... Murphy...Sorry I'm late.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.489
...what are you, Murphy,
what are you doing here?

31:22.532 --> 31:24.012
I'm here forthe big meeting.

31:24.056 --> 31:26.841
So what's been said?
What did I miss?GENE: Nothing yet,

31:26.885 --> 31:29.844
just a mysterious bag
sitting in front of me.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.978
Uh, is it-- Does anybody want totell me what's-what's going on?

31:33.021 --> 31:34.936
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna tell you
what's going on.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.418
Officer...
I didn't catch your name.

31:38.461 --> 31:42.813
Gene. Uh, Clemens.
It's Officer Clemens.

31:42.857 --> 31:45.904
Well, we recently
caught someone...

31:48.254 --> 31:51.387
...littering all over Chicago.

31:51.431 --> 31:52.954
It was very upsetting,

31:52.998 --> 31:54.956
it was very reckless.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.786
Bottles and cans, gum--

31:58.829 --> 32:00.744
all over the city.

32:01.920 --> 32:05.532
So, you're all here
because of litter?

32:05.575 --> 32:07.882
Yes.
Yep.

32:07.926 --> 32:12.887
Because littering is thenumber one problem in our city.

32:15.368 --> 32:16.978
That's not true.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.806
Could be.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.940
Look, guys, I-I appreciate
the honor and respect

32:21.983 --> 32:23.985
you have for Mother Earth, okay?

32:24.029 --> 32:26.422
But this isn't the type of thingthat we-we focus on.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.035
Oh.
Hmm.

32:30.078 --> 32:33.429
Okay. Uh, we will just take
our backpack of trash

32:33.473 --> 32:34.953
and put it in the trash
where it belongs.

32:36.606 --> 32:37.868
There's garbage in that?

32:37.912 --> 32:39.392
Yes.
Yep.

32:39.435 --> 32:42.264
It was evidence, but...

32:42.308 --> 32:45.311
I have a briefing
I have to get to.

32:45.354 --> 32:46.921
I'm-I'm gonna walk you guys out.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.705
Okay.
GENE:
Okay.

32:48.749 --> 32:51.882
Nice meeting you. Pretzel.

32:52.927 --> 32:54.015
What just happened?

32:54.059 --> 32:56.583
We can't trust the cops.Wh-Why?

32:56.626 --> 32:58.019
Because they're
protecting Dean.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.935
What? What do you mean?Dean's back on the force!

33:00.979 --> 33:02.632
I handed that cop
my statement.

33:02.676 --> 33:05.505
I literally gave him a
recording where Dean admits

33:05.548 --> 33:06.985
to murdering Tyson and
they still protected him.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.856
So I don't know who
we can trust in there.

33:08.899 --> 33:10.858
But you recorded him.I know.

33:10.901 --> 33:12.425
I don't even know
