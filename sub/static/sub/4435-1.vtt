Boner balls.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.415
Boner balls.
Boner -- Boner forest.

00:52.625 --> 00:55.207
Dense boner forest.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.082
Pungent crotch sweat.

00:58.291 --> 01:01.290
Pungent --
Milk-- Milky crotch ooze.

01:02.291 --> 01:03.999
Barking vaginal belch.

01:04.208 --> 01:05.832
Protruding vaginal boner.

01:06.041 --> 01:07.749
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

01:07.958 --> 01:09.874
Oh, I like that.

01:12.166 --> 01:14.540
Rotten booby turds!

01:14.750 --> 01:15.874
Nah.

01:16.083 --> 01:18.374
- Bloody butt cough.
- Uh-huh.

01:20.250 --> 01:21.749
Angry clit spasm.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.874
Nope, sorry.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.665
Whooping fart balls.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.832
Nope.

01:30.041 --> 01:31.665
Lubricated titty burgers.

01:32.916 --> 01:34.249
That's taken too.

01:34.458 --> 01:37.249
Indifferent rectal
semen splooge.

01:37.458 --> 01:38.874
Sorry.

01:39.083 --> 01:40.999
Indifferent Rectal
Semen Splooge is taken?

01:41.208 --> 01:41.832
Come on!

01:42.041 --> 01:43.790
How are we supposed to name
our start-up company

01:44.000 --> 01:45.707
if every name is already taken?

01:45.916 --> 01:47.290
I told you,
you just have to be

01:47.500 --> 01:49.332
really original
with your company name.

01:49.541 --> 01:51.415
There's a lot of
start-up companies these days.

01:51.625 --> 01:56.124
Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly
on the Table, Inc.

01:56.708 --> 01:58.499
That's available!

01:58.708 --> 02:00.832
Congratulations.

02:08.666 --> 02:11.415
It doesn't quite
roll of the tongue.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.374
Dude, we're not gonna get
any attention with that name.

02:13.583 --> 02:15.082
Man, this sucks!

02:15.291 --> 02:17.957
Uh, Stan, aren't you
supposed to be in school?

02:18.166 --> 02:19.499
No, Dad, we don't need
school anymore.

02:19.708 --> 02:20.999
We're forming
a start-up company.

02:21.208 --> 02:24.290
A start-up company?
A company that does what?

02:24.500 --> 02:25.790
No, we don't want to
do anything.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.624
Yeah, that's why we want
to have a start-up company.

02:27.833 --> 02:28.665
Yeah, we're sick of school,

02:28.875 --> 02:30.165
but all
the good, attention-getting

02:30.375 --> 02:31.582
start-up company names
are taken!

02:31.791 --> 02:34.415
Well, boys, there's more
to starting a company

02:34.625 --> 02:36.040
than having a catchy name.

02:37.375 --> 02:39.124
No, there isn't.

02:42.083 --> 02:44.207
You guys!
You guys, it's awesome!

02:44.416 --> 02:47.374
Holy shit, you guys!

02:48.875 --> 02:50.415
You guys, I've got it!

02:50.625 --> 02:51.499
What?

02:51.708 --> 02:53.415
It's the greatest
start-up company name ever.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.165
What? Tell us!

02:55.375 --> 02:58.915
Washington Redskins.

03:00.125 --> 03:01.040
Washington Redskins?

03:01.250 --> 03:02.415
It's so sweet.

03:02.625 --> 03:04.040
I'm pretty sure
that's taken, Cartman.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.040
It's not, dude!

03:05.250 --> 03:07.290
Some dumb court thingy happened,
and the trademark got pulled!

03:07.500 --> 03:09.165
We can use it!
And the logo!

03:09.375 --> 03:11.624
Washington Redskins.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.332
- I like it.
- Mrph rm!

03:13.541 --> 03:14.165
What?

03:14.375 --> 03:16.165
Dude, there's already
brand-name awareness,

03:16.375 --> 03:17.665
and it's
instantly recognizable.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.999
Wait, guys, this --
this doesn't seem legal.

03:20.208 --> 03:21.457
Kyle, you're not hearing me.

03:21.666 --> 03:25.332
The trademark has been pulled.
We can do whatever we want.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.332
- You all right, dude?
- Yeah. I just...

03:39.541 --> 03:40.707
Well, I just thought
our company name would be

03:40.916 --> 03:42.540
more, like, original.

03:42.750 --> 03:43.790
It's a strong name, dude.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.040
It's, like, aggressive
and masculine,

03:45.250 --> 03:47.165
like Boner Forest,
but Boner Forest was taken.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.832
Yeah, but maybe we need
a name that's more affirming,

03:50.041 --> 03:51.665
like, shows what we stand for.

03:51.875 --> 03:54.499
We don't stand for anything.
Remember our company plan, guys.

03:54.708 --> 03:57.915
Start up, cash in,
sell out, bro down.

03:58.125 --> 03:59.165
I'm just not sure
this is the name

03:59.375 --> 04:00.624
people are gonna give money to.

04:00.833 --> 04:02.582
- We already got a dollar!
- What?

04:02.791 --> 04:04.582
- $1 pledged!
- Mrph rm!

04:04.791 --> 04:05.999
I told you, guys!

04:06.208 --> 04:08.165
"Washington Redskins" totally
gets peoples' attention!

04:08.375 --> 04:10.290
- Another $2!
- No way!

04:10.500 --> 04:13.582
Sitting on our asses,
here we come!

04:13.791 --> 04:15.874
Another new start-up company

04:16.083 --> 04:18.624
is gaining a lot of attention
on the Internet.

04:18.833 --> 04:21.540
They're a company that does
absolutely nothing

04:21.750 --> 04:24.332
and they're called
the Washington Redskins.

04:24.541 --> 04:26.582
The Redskins started
as what appeared to be

04:26.791 --> 04:28.624
some kind of adolescent prank,

04:28.833 --> 04:30.540
but almost overnight
it has become

04:30.750 --> 04:33.415
one of the most heavily funded
projects on Kickstarter.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.082
Why did you give $5

04:35.291 --> 04:37.790
to the Washington Redskins
Kickstarter?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.624
I don't know, I just --

04:39.833 --> 04:41.624
They don't do anything.
That's pretty sweet.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.624
I don't know.
I thought it was funny.

04:43.833 --> 04:46.249
By pledging just $1 or $2,
you are helping us

04:46.458 --> 04:48.457
in our fervent quest
to not have to do stuff.

04:48.666 --> 04:50.707
If you pledge $10 or more,
you will receive

04:50.916 --> 04:52.999
this luxurious company
micro badge.

04:53.208 --> 04:54.957
It's called crowdfunding --

04:55.166 --> 04:56.790
using the Internet
to raise money

04:57.000 --> 04:59.332
without having to
pay back your investors,

04:59.541 --> 05:04.249
a tactic that some believe
is unfair and impersonal.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.749
Washington Redskins,
go fuck yourself.

05:10.958 --> 05:12.540
Sure! We'd be happy
to take your money.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.582
Yep, just go
to our Kickstarter page.

05:14.791 --> 05:17.415
Okay, nice, idiot.
Uh-huh, fuck you, bye-bye.

05:17.625 --> 05:18.999
You are Eric Cartman?

05:19.208 --> 05:19.915
Yes, I know.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.415
My name is Dan Snyder.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.124
I'm the president and owner
of the Washington Redskins.

05:24.333 --> 05:25.457
Oh, cool.
Please, take a seat.

05:25.666 --> 05:26.915
Thank you, but I will stand.

05:27.125 --> 05:27.874
Nice. I like that.

05:28.083 --> 05:31.249
Young man, we ask that you
please stop using the name

05:31.458 --> 05:33.499
Washington Redskins
for your organization.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.749
Stop? But why?

05:35.958 --> 05:37.749
Because we are
the Washington Redskins

05:37.958 --> 05:39.915
and we are a football team.

05:40.125 --> 05:42.249
You have no right to use
our name to get attention.

05:42.458 --> 05:43.874
Uh, the trademark got pulled,

05:44.083 --> 05:45.582
so I'm totally free
to use the name, actually.

05:47.125 --> 05:48.374
Uh, Butters,
could you get that?

05:48.583 --> 05:51.082
Washington Redskins,
go fuck yourself.

05:51.291 --> 05:53.415
Look, don't you see that
when you call your organization

05:53.625 --> 05:56.499
the Washington Redskins,
it's offensive to us?

05:56.708 --> 05:58.332
How is it offensive?

05:58.541 --> 06:00.207
How is it offensive?!
Jesus, what --

06:00.416 --> 06:02.415
we are a proud team,
Mr. Cartman.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.457
We have no wish
to be associated

06:04.666 --> 06:06.457
with people
who actively do nothing.

06:06.666 --> 06:07.915
Makes us feel like a joke!

06:08.125 --> 06:10.707
Guys, guys.
We have total respect for you.

06:10.916 --> 06:12.832
When we named our company
Washington Redskins,

06:13.041 --> 06:16.249
it was out of deep appreciation
for your team and your people.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.207
Uh, I know I can't legally
make you stop using our name,

06:21.416 --> 06:24.499
but -- but won't you just do it
out of decency?

06:24.708 --> 06:26.999
N-N-N-No.

06:27.208 --> 06:28.915
Because I don't want to,

06:29.125 --> 06:31.082
and we can't just
change the name of our company

06:31.291 --> 06:32.624
'cause it's, like, super hard.

06:32.833 --> 06:37.207
But, hey, from one Redskin
to another, go fuck yourself.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.374
All around the world,
people are saying

06:51.583 --> 06:54.707
they are inspired
by the Washington Redskins.

06:54.916 --> 06:57.249
The Internet start-up company
has raised so much money

06:57.458 --> 07:01.207
on Kickstarter that now
more groups are doing the same.

07:01.416 --> 07:03.707
More news on the
Washington Redskins tonight.

07:03.916 --> 07:05.415
Their defiant "F you" attitude

07:05.625 --> 07:08.290
has now caught the attention
of the terrorist group ISIS.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.665
The terrorists said they admire
the Washington Redskins

07:11.875 --> 07:13.832
and want to try and follow
their business model.

07:14.041 --> 07:16.040
Well, let's not
forget, Marsha,

07:16.250 --> 07:17.374
that there's a people here,
okay,

07:17.583 --> 07:19.915
who are not happy
about the use of the name --

07:20.125 --> 07:21.582
the football
Washington Redskins.

07:21.791 --> 07:24.915
Well, yeah but does
anyone really care about them?

07:29.083 --> 07:31.040
Dude, this is so cool!

07:31.250 --> 07:32.957
We only have six days to go
before all the money

07:33.166 --> 07:34.582
pledged to our company
becomes liquid.

07:34.791 --> 07:36.624
Guys, we need to talk to you.

07:36.833 --> 07:38.082
I really don't think
we want to be a company

07:38.291 --> 07:39.290
that ISIS looks up to.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.749
We should maybe
issue a statement saying

07:40.958 --> 07:41.915
that we don't sanction them.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.374
Oh, no.
No, you guys.

07:43.583 --> 07:45.207
We started this company
to do nothing.

07:45.416 --> 07:47.374
If we start doing stuff now,
it'll put it all at risk.

07:47.583 --> 07:48.915
People aren't
going to support our company

07:49.125 --> 07:51.332
if we dig in our heels and say
we don't care about anything.

07:51.541 --> 07:53.207
Digging in our heels
and pissing on public opinion

07:53.416 --> 07:54.999
is what the Washington Redskins
are all about!

07:55.208 --> 07:56.415
Now, come on, guys!

07:56.625 --> 07:57.874
If you want to be
a successful business,

07:58.083 --> 07:59.790
then you have to be honest
about what you are.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.832
Once you take a stand
on something, you're pretending

08:02.041 --> 08:03.415
like your company is about
more than money.

08:03.625 --> 08:04.832
Then all of a sudden,
you're the NFL

08:05.041 --> 08:07.040
and your players get caught
molesting little boys!

08:08.083 --> 08:09.332
That's the Catholic church!

08:09.541 --> 08:11.207
NFL, Catholic church --
same thing!

08:11.416 --> 08:12.624
Okay, let's use
the Catholic church.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.040
You take a moral stand
on issues,

08:14.250 --> 08:15.749
you say you're about honor
and integrity,

08:15.958 --> 08:17.374
and the next thing you know,
your clergymen are

08:17.583 --> 08:19.832
getting caught beating up
their wives in an elevator.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.999
- That's the NFL.
- It's the same thing, Kyle!

08:23.208 --> 08:25.040
The point is,
if we as an organization

08:25.250 --> 08:27.915
claim to be about high morality,
somebody is eventually

08:28.125 --> 08:29.582
going to get raped or beaten
in an elevator,

08:29.791 --> 08:31.249
and it's most likely
going to be Butters.

08:31.458 --> 08:32.790
Oh, no!

08:33.000 --> 08:36.707
All right, I really didn't
want to have to do this, but...

08:36.916 --> 08:39.832
I'm not happy with the direction
this company is taking.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.540
Well, what are you gonna do?
Go back to school?

08:42.750 --> 08:44.832
I'm not going back there, man.

08:45.041 --> 08:47.874
Maybe I'll start
my own company.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.082
Well, that's fine.

08:49.291 --> 08:50.707
You can't call yourself
Washington Redskins!

08:50.916 --> 08:53.207
I don't want to!
It's a stupid name!

08:58.041 --> 09:01.749
Well, I guess everything's
out on the table now, huh, Kyle?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.332
Yeah, I guess --
I guess everything is.

09:04.541 --> 09:08.415
Stan, do you think
our name is stupid too?

09:08.625 --> 09:10.040
I don't know.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.249
But I don't know if my future
is with this company either.

09:12.458 --> 09:15.540
Well, then, I wish you both well
in your new venture.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.665
Goodbye.

09:19.791 --> 09:22.290
Hang on. Is this the company
where I don't raped?

09:22.500 --> 09:25.582
Yeah, h-here, right?
Okay, I-I'm staying here.

09:27.916 --> 09:29.999
Is the league
just going to sit by

09:30.208 --> 09:33.540
while my team and my players
are compared to ISIS?

09:33.750 --> 09:36.249
You have to do something,
Commissioner Goodell!

09:36.458 --> 09:38.165
What are you going to do
about this?

09:39.166 --> 09:40.540
I will
get it right

09:40.750 --> 09:43.790
and do whatever is necessary
to accomplish that.

09:45.666 --> 09:46.915
What?

09:47.125 --> 09:52.457
We will continue to identify
and add expertise to our team.

09:53.458 --> 09:56.290
That's the most ridiculous,
nothing answer I've ever heard.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.790
What are you gonna do now?

09:58.000 --> 10:01.707
Everyone will participate
in education sessions

10:01.916 --> 10:04.582
starting in the next month.

10:04.791 --> 10:06.665
Ugh!
This thing is broken!

10:06.875 --> 10:10.707
We can add -- And we will
do more -- do more --

10:10.916 --> 10:11.999
do more --
do more...

10:12.208 --> 10:13.624
Get all the NFL owners
on Skype!

10:13.833 --> 10:16.165
This -- This thing
is broken again!

10:16.375 --> 10:19.499
And so I call upon the help
of all owners --

10:19.708 --> 10:22.540
You cannot let my people
be belittled like this.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.874
Dan, you don't want to be
dealing with this stuff,

10:25.083 --> 10:26.332
let the Goodell-bot do it.

10:26.541 --> 10:28.249
The stupid thing
isn't working!

10:28.458 --> 10:29.749
I will
get it right.

10:29.958 --> 10:32.332
Man, that thing hasn't worked
right since we bought it.

10:32.541 --> 10:34.999
Look, my team is starting
to lose hope.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.832
You have to use your influence

10:37.041 --> 10:38.790
to make these people
change their name.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.624
Did you tell them we're
about honor and integrity?

10:41.833 --> 10:43.499
If the Goodell-bot is broken,

10:43.708 --> 10:46.082
we must stay out of it
more than even usual.

10:46.291 --> 10:47.374
And so I'm alone?

10:47.583 --> 10:49.874
What if they ridicule
the 49ers' team next?

10:50.083 --> 10:51.040
Or make fun of Jerry Jones

10:51.250 --> 10:52.499
because his eyes
are too far apart?

10:52.708 --> 10:54.582
My eyes aren't too far apart.

10:54.791 --> 10:56.540
If we get them
to change their logo,

10:56.750 --> 10:57.707
will it make you happy?

10:57.916 --> 11:00.165
I-I guess
we can live with that.

11:00.375 --> 11:01.749
Then it is decided.

11:01.958 --> 11:03.999
We will make them
change their logo.

11:04.208 --> 11:05.374
Begin mass-behind-the-scenes,

11:05.583 --> 11:07.957
under-the-table
enforcement of our wishes now!

11:08.166 --> 11:09.582
Go!

11:10.958 --> 11:12.374
Thank God.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.499
Fuck you, fuck you!

11:23.541 --> 11:26.207
Fuck you up there.
Fuck you.

11:26.416 --> 11:27.957
"Fuck you."

11:28.166 --> 11:29.999
Those words mean
a great deal to us.

11:30.208 --> 11:33.165
They help us express
just how we as a company

11:33.375 --> 11:34.957
see things differently.

11:35.166 --> 11:36.665
There are a lot of start-up
companies on Kickstarter,

11:36.875 --> 11:38.124
but after today
I think you'll agree

11:38.333 --> 11:40.707
that Washington Redskins
is the most exciting.

11:40.916 --> 11:42.707
As you know,
the Redskins have been

11:42.916 --> 11:44.457
on the forefront of Kickstarter
as a company

11:44.666 --> 11:46.874
that is always finding
new and exciting ways

11:47.083 --> 11:48.499
to tell people
to go fuck themselves.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.790
And now our company is
thrilled to show you

11:51.000 --> 11:53.457
all the latest innovations
we've come up with.

11:53.666 --> 11:55.707
To begin with,
we have moved the couch

11:55.916 --> 11:58.374
from the left side of the office
to the right side.

11:58.583 --> 11:59.540
But we didn't stop there.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.040
We also added a new rug

12:01.250 --> 12:03.165
that goes better
with our office drapes.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.207
And probably
most exciting of all,

12:05.416 --> 12:09.207
we have actually updated
the company from the inside out.

12:09.416 --> 12:11.749
We received a lot of pressure
from certain communities

12:11.958 --> 12:13.582
to change our Redskins logo.

12:13.791 --> 12:17.665
As a company we want to be firm,
but we also want to be flexible,

12:17.875 --> 12:19.582
and so we thought
if we have to change our logo,

12:19.791 --> 12:21.665
it should be more
in step with today's times

12:21.875 --> 12:24.415
but still define us as
the leading Kickstarter company.

12:24.625 --> 12:27.082
What we came up with
is the new company logo

12:27.291 --> 12:30.332
that I think you'll all agree
is very exciting.

12:35.416 --> 12:37.249
Now when people hear
the name "Redskins,"

12:37.458 --> 12:39.832
they will immediately think
"titties" and "balls."

12:40.041 --> 12:41.832
It's just a bold new way
that we can say,

12:42.041 --> 12:42.874
"We don't fucking care."

12:43.083 --> 12:44.207
Go, Redskins!

12:48.041 --> 12:50.540
It's so awesome, dude.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.499
Our company already has
a hundred backers,

12:52.708 --> 12:55.582
and we still have
14 days to go!

12:55.791 --> 12:57.082
Yeah.

12:57.291 --> 12:58.915
You okay, bro?

12:59.125 --> 13:01.832
I just never saw myself
owning a company called

13:02.041 --> 13:04.249
Furry Balls Plopped
Menacingly on the Table.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.165
Give it time.
It'll grow on you.

13:06.375 --> 13:08.374
Why don't we just call it
Untitled Start-up Company?

13:08.583 --> 13:10.582
Because that sounds like
we don't have anything.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.207
We've been through this
already, Stan.

13:12.416 --> 13:13.374
Yeah, I know that.

13:13.583 --> 13:17.624
But a good company should never
have seven words in its title.

13:17.833 --> 13:18.749
What do you mean?

13:18.958 --> 13:20.457
I just feel that
somewhere out there,

13:20.666 --> 13:23.749
there's a perfect
start-up company name,

13:23.958 --> 13:26.749
and I need to be free
to go find it.

13:26.958 --> 13:28.999
Oh.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.249
Well, I certainly
don't want you to feel

13:31.458 --> 13:32.874
that Furry Balls Plopped
Menacingly on the Table

13:33.083 --> 13:34.999
is holding you back.

13:38.125 --> 13:39.957
Good luck
with your company, dude.

13:40.166 --> 13:42.582
Yeah.
Good luck with yours.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.207
It's just incredible, Harry.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.540
Everyone is using Kickstarter
for everything!

13:54.750 --> 13:57.749
And for every project funded,
we get 5%.

13:57.958 --> 14:00.207
It's like we don't even
have to do anything

14:00.416 --> 14:01.749
and we just make money.

14:01.958 --> 14:04.624
Sitting on our asses,
here we come.

14:09.666 --> 14:12.082
Caw-caw. Caw-caw

14:15.625 --> 14:17.707
Hoo-hoo.
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

14:27.208 --> 14:28.665
Huh?

14:37.125 --> 14:37.999
Aah!

14:54.625 --> 14:55.832
Aah!

15:02.458 --> 15:05.374
Go-o-od morning, guys!

15:05.583 --> 15:07.957
- Happy deadline day!
- We made it, guys.

15:08.166 --> 15:09.332
We can finally stop doing stuff

15:09.541 --> 15:11.082
and see just how much
our company made

15:11.291 --> 15:13.582
in four, three, two, one --

15:13.791 --> 15:15.540
That's the deadline!

15:15.750 --> 15:18.332
Oh, boy, this is
like Christmas morning!

15:19.750 --> 15:21.999
What the hell?
"Can't find the server"?

15:22.208 --> 15:23.665
Kickstarter.com.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.207
Kickstarter.
Where is Kickstarter?

15:27.416 --> 15:28.665
Get it up on your phone,
Butters.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.374
Come on, I want to know
how much our company is worth!

15:30.583 --> 15:32.249
It's not coming up
on my phone either. I --

15:32.458 --> 15:33.540
Holy Mother Mary!

15:33.750 --> 15:34.249
Mrph?

15:34.458 --> 15:35.415
Somebody raided Kickstarter

15:35.625 --> 15:36.790
and they burned the building
to the ground!

15:37.000 --> 15:39.249
- What?!
- Somebody killed Kickstarter!

15:39.458 --> 15:41.749
Who the hell would burn
Kickstarter to the ground?

15:41.958 --> 15:44.082
Oh, my God!

15:44.291 --> 15:47.040
That weird, little Jewy guy!

15:47.250 --> 15:48.707
Kyle!

15:54.583 --> 15:55.915
What the hell is wrong?

15:56.125 --> 15:59.332
"Can't find the server"?
Kickstarter.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.415
- You son of a bitch!
- What?

16:01.625 --> 16:02.832
You broke Kickstarter!

16:03.041 --> 16:04.957
N-No, I just can't get it
to load.

16:05.166 --> 16:06.499
Nobody can!
It's gone!

16:06.708 --> 16:08.040
You just couldn't take it
that our company

16:08.250 --> 16:09.582
was more successful
than yours would ever be!

16:09.791 --> 16:11.374
My company was
on Kickstarter too!

16:11.583 --> 16:13.332
- Why would I get rid of it?
- Well, somebody did!

16:13.541 --> 16:14.957
It doesn't matter, you guys.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.874
There's something
a lot more important here.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.415
Do you guys remember
when we first decided

16:21.625 --> 16:23.415
to start a company together?

16:23.625 --> 16:25.165
We all had a common goal,

16:25.375 --> 16:26.749
and we weren't gonna let
anything stop us

16:26.958 --> 16:28.624
from getting to the bro down.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.582
But somewhere between
starting up and selling out,

16:30.791 --> 16:33.290
we -- we lost our way.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.665
We can't do this on our own.
We need each other.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.249
He's right.
We should do a merger.

16:39.458 --> 16:40.582
A merger?

16:40.791 --> 16:41.749
It's too late for that,
you guys!

16:41.958 --> 16:43.207
Kickstarter is gone!

16:43.416 --> 16:46.457
We don't have a company!
We don't have anything!

16:46.666 --> 16:47.749
Yes, we do.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.749
We have a sweet name.

16:54.958 --> 16:56.582
I was wrong, Cartman.

16:56.791 --> 16:58.957
Washington Redskins
is the perfect name.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.874
I think maybe I was just jealous
that I didn't come up with it.

17:04.458 --> 17:05.707
It is really sweet.

17:05.916 --> 17:08.249
And we always said that
all we needed was a sweet name

17:08.458 --> 17:10.290
and the rest
would figure itself out.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.540
Yeah, we can do it, fellas!
It'll be like old times!

17:13.750 --> 17:15.499
What do you say, Cartman?

17:21.250 --> 17:23.540
Fuck you!

17:23.750 --> 17:26.082
Fuck you, everyone!

17:26.291 --> 17:28.457
Yes, fuck you all.
Thanks!

17:28.666 --> 17:30.999
How do you stay relevant
in a volatile marketplace?

17:31.208 --> 17:33.874
As you know,
our goal at Washington Redskins

17:34.083 --> 17:36.124
is to not do anything
and make money not doing it.

17:36.333 --> 17:37.749
When Kickstarter went down,

17:37.958 --> 17:39.790
many saw
their start-up projects die,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.040
but here at Washington Redskins
we saw opportunity.

17:43.250 --> 17:44.707
People still need a way
to raise money

17:44.916 --> 17:46.082
for their stupid
start-up projects,

17:46.291 --> 17:49.540
and with the Redskins
you can now go fund yourself.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.165
And the idea is simple.

17:51.375 --> 17:54.165
You, the people, go out
and raise all your own money,

17:54.375 --> 17:56.040
and give
the Washington Redskins 5%.

17:56.250 --> 17:57.790
You will literally
be giving us money

17:58.000 --> 17:59.582
for doing absolutely nothing.

17:59.791 --> 18:02.249
It is the biggest fuck you
we have ever come up with.

18:02.458 --> 18:03.540
But we didn't stop there,

18:03.750 --> 18:05.749
because a new company direction
also means, of course,

18:05.958 --> 18:08.207
a new and improved logo.

18:12.708 --> 18:15.040
Go, Redskins!

18:15.250 --> 18:17.249
A beautiful night
in Arlington, Texas,

18:17.458 --> 18:20.749
as the Dallas Cowboys get set to
take on the Washington Redskins.

18:20.958 --> 18:22.457
That is, of course,
Washington Redskins

18:22.666 --> 18:24.707
the football team,
not Washington Redskins

18:24.916 --> 18:26.665
the audacious
crowdfunding company.

18:26.875 --> 18:29.165
Yeah, and if you ask me,
the Redskins are a scam.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.207
You're talking about the
crowdfunding company Redskins.

18:31.416 --> 18:32.040
That's right.

18:32.250 --> 18:34.499
A-And now you've got
terrorist groups like ISIS

18:34.708 --> 18:36.290
using the Redskins
to raise their money.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.249
I don't like
what the Redskins are doing.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.832
- Those Redskins.
- Yeah, whatever.

18:43.791 --> 18:44.957
It's over.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.207
Our name has been reduced
to a stereotype and a joke.

18:48.416 --> 18:50.374
Yeah, let's just go home.

18:50.583 --> 18:53.499
No.
No, we cannot give up!

18:53.708 --> 18:55.540
We have been through
too much together!

18:55.750 --> 18:57.749
We have fought Eagle and Bear!

18:57.958 --> 19:00.124
The Eagles only beat us
by 3 points!

19:00.333 --> 19:03.249
Yeah, but I just feel stupid
wearing this now.

19:03.458 --> 19:06.374
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.874
Where will we go?
What will we do?

19:09.083 --> 19:12.582
Don't let them break you!
Don't let them win!

19:18.416 --> 19:20.332
And the Cowboys
are still set to kick off,

19:20.541 --> 19:22.832
but there doesn't seem anyone
to kick off to.

19:23.041 --> 19:25.249
Yeah,
and Jerry Jones must be happy.

19:25.458 --> 19:28.249
This means a forfeit
and another win for the Cowboys.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.915
Wait a minute --
It appears a lone Redskin

19:30.125 --> 19:31.332
is making his way
out of the locker room.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.165
The Cowboys kick it off.

19:58.416 --> 19:59.582
Hut!

19:59.791 --> 20:01.457
Hut hut hut!

20:01.666 --> 20:03.499
Aah! Aah!

20:06.875 --> 20:09.665
Hut hut hut.
Hut hut hut hut!

20:09.875 --> 20:11.540
Ah! Aah!

20:11.750 --> 20:14.165
Aah!

20:15.916 --> 20:18.665
Hut!
Hut hut hut.

20:18.875 --> 20:20.124
Hut hut!

20:20.333 --> 20:21.915
Aah! Aah!

20:22.125 --> 20:22.999
Oh!

20:23.208 --> 20:26.082
Just stay down,
for the love of God!

20:26.291 --> 20:29.499
Hut hut.
Hut.

20:29.708 --> 20:31.665
Aah! Aah!

20:31.875 --> 20:34.082
- Stop! Make it stop!
- Just stay down!

20:34.291 --> 20:35.582
Please,
just make him stay down!

20:35.791 --> 20:38.082
- Go, Redskins!
- Go, Redskins!

20:42.333 --> 20:44.332
Boy, this is the life,
huh, guys?

20:44.541 --> 20:45.832
We finally did it!

20:46.041 --> 20:49.874
I might just sit here until
my ass fuses into the couch.

20:51.541 --> 20:52.832
What the hell is that?

20:58.875 --> 20:59.999
Whoa, whoa!
What?

21:00.208 --> 21:01.582
Change your name!

21:01.791 --> 21:03.999
It doesn't belong
in today's society!

21:04.208 --> 21:05.332
Change our name?

21:05.541 --> 21:06.874
But you all thought
our name was sweet.

21:07.083 --> 21:10.332
There's nothing sweet about
a people who were decimated,

21:10.541 --> 21:13.457
a once proud nation
that finally lost hope

21:13.666 --> 21:15.874
and left their leader
to be massacred by Cowboys

21:16.083 --> 21:17.790
in a defiant last stand.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.499
When was this?

21:19.708 --> 21:21.207
Last night.

21:21.416 --> 21:23.665
Until you change your name,
we are asking

21:23.875 --> 21:26.290
all your subscribers
to boycott you!

21:26.500 --> 21:27.790
That's right.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.040
ISIS will no longer use
your insensitive company

21:31.250 --> 21:32.499
for its fund-raising.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.749
- Yeah!
- All right!

21:33.958 --> 21:34.957
Good for you, ISIS!

21:35.166 --> 21:36.957
What the hell do we do?

21:38.791 --> 21:40.957
I guess we got to go
back to school.
