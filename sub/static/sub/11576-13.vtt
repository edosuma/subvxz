WEBVTT

00:06.465 --> 00:08.877
My intentions were true,
but years of imprisonment

00:09.093 --> 00:12.005
weakened myjudgment; clouded
my reason. I was a fool.

00:12.221 --> 00:15.008
I stood in front of my
friends and said I choose you!

00:15.224 --> 00:17.089
Rosette was my
most loyal general.

00:17.310 --> 00:18.174
We loved one another.

00:18.394 --> 00:20.180
If he managed to
turn her against me--

00:20.396 --> 00:22.637
He made her throw
herself into a fire, Rainer!

00:22.857 --> 00:24.188
Who is he, Bo?

00:24.400 --> 00:27.517
Someone even
the Blood King fears.

00:27.737 --> 00:30.854
My father
manipulated all of us.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.529
There's one advantage.

00:32.742 --> 00:35.074
One thing your father
never could forsee.

00:35.286 --> 00:36.947
We share something real.

00:37.163 --> 00:38.949
Something good.

00:39.165 --> 00:40.996
(gaSPS)

00:41.209 --> 00:42.244
Rainer.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.996
What is happening to me?

00:44.212 --> 00:45.793
Our marks...

00:46.005 --> 00:49.247
No. His mark.

00:49.467 --> 00:53.301
Bo, whatever happens,
we will fight this.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.967
Life is hard when you
don â€™t know who you are.

01:01.187 --> 01:03.849
It's even harder when
you don 't know what you are.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.772
My love carries
a death sentence.

01:06.984 --> 01:11.819
I was lost for years.
Searching while hiding.

01:12.031 --> 01:16.024
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.825
I won 't hide anymore.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.449
I will live the life I choose.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.044
You!

01:29.257 --> 01:30.542
What have you done to her!

01:30.758 --> 01:31.873
I knew you were poison.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.674
This, from the King
who separated families,

01:33.886 --> 01:35.171
and had children
watch as their parents

01:35.388 --> 01:36.503
were burned at the
stake if they didn't

01:36.722 --> 01:37.928
choose between Light and Dark!

01:38.140 --> 01:39.801
Stop... please.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.393
The Pyrripus.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.887
You've heard of The Pyrripus?

01:43.104 --> 01:45.060
We ran into these warrior nuns.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.764
Lots of white,
even more crazy.

01:47.984 --> 01:50.225
Trick, they
worship a horse god.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.696
A demon. They think
it's my father.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.987
We bound to break your curse.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.030
Instead we opened
the gateway to Hel.

01:57.243 --> 01:58.779
You should never
have left the train.

01:58.995 --> 02:00.781
You're the one who put
me there in the first place!

02:00.997 --> 02:02.612
You dared to challenge
the blood laws!

02:02.832 --> 02:04.697
When will you
take responsibility

02:04.917 --> 02:06.032
for the chaos you've caused?

02:06.252 --> 02:07.583
You forget who
you're talking to.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.037
I wasn't scared of you then
and I am not scared of you now.

02:11.257 --> 02:12.212
Stop!

02:12.425 --> 02:13.380
My father's close.

02:13.592 --> 02:14.456
How do you know?

02:14.677 --> 02:16.338
I can feel him.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.385
He's trying to
cross the bridge.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.133
He's trying to bring her out.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.555
He needs her, Trick.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.631
Who?

02:22.852 --> 02:24.183
Ah!

02:26.397 --> 02:28.353
The Dark Queen.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.477
Me.

02:33.237 --> 02:36.354
I've always known this,
but now I need you to tell me

02:36.574 --> 02:38.565
everything you
know about my blood.

02:42.955 --> 02:46.288
Mother, it's burning.
But it's so cold.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.912
So cold, it's so hollow.

02:49.128 --> 02:51.210
And the horrific answer to
the nature nurture debate.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.879
It takes both to
truly make a monster.

02:54.091 --> 02:57.629
First a human,
then a monster, now a god.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.631
A god with
the twig of Zamora--

02:59.847 --> 03:01.212
Yeah, whose
power is diminishing

03:01.432 --> 03:04.048
now that you've killed
Hale, the last Zamoran heir.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.384
Way to go, Massimo, way to go.

03:06.604 --> 03:07.093
You lie!

03:07.313 --> 03:08.849
Yeah, now your only
chance for being immortal

03:09.065 --> 03:12.102
is someone writing a shitty
pop song about you, hm?

03:12.318 --> 03:14.149
About a villain who
cries about his Mommy

03:14.362 --> 03:16.648
whose hair goes
prematurely gray.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.606
The only thing awaiting
you is this grave.

03:19.825 --> 03:23.067
Auugh!

03:23.287 --> 03:24.902
I swallowed the Origin Seed,

03:25.122 --> 03:27.204
and now it's
trying to devour me!

03:27.416 --> 03:31.204
It took a council of
six Fae to keep control

03:31.420 --> 03:33.331
of the Una Mens' power.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.380
The human brain can
only take so much, Massimo.

03:36.592 --> 03:37.672
You are wrong.

03:41.263 --> 03:44.005
A man who will
make my mother proud.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.432
You think that Evony
would be proud of this?

03:46.644 --> 03:49.852
She didn't want
one mead, nor seed;

03:50.064 --> 03:53.727
No Valkyrie hair,
no maidens fair.

03:56.112 --> 03:58.068
(giggles)

03:58.280 --> 04:02.239
No, wait. She did
want the maiden.

04:02.451 --> 04:07.320
Yes. Yes. That'll work.

04:07.540 --> 04:10.202
That is what we'll
bring to Mother.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.874
No.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.828
The Succubus' head.

04:18.300 --> 04:22.168
I swear, the true
identity of your father

04:22.388 --> 04:23.594
remains shrouded from me.

04:23.806 --> 04:24.886
Much like your own guilt.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.009
Enough.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.305
We don't have time
for petty bickering.

04:27.518 --> 04:29.975
Petty? He killed
thousands of Fae.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.098
And more will die if
we don't close the gateway.

04:32.314 --> 04:35.397
Trick. My father.

04:37.069 --> 04:40.232
When the Blood King's
daughter attacked the Dark,

04:40.448 --> 04:45.363
to avenge her mother's death,
the King had to set an example.

04:45.578 --> 04:48.786
To prove that his blood
laws were infallible.

04:53.794 --> 04:57.582
I had no choice but to
hand her over to the Dark.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.959
Aife is your mother?

05:00.176 --> 05:03.919
I prayed she'd be
executed. She wasn't.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.845
All of those years
in the black dungeons.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.140
Centuries. They used her.

05:10.352 --> 05:14.971
Aife has my Light blood.
The blood of a mage.

05:15.191 --> 05:18.558
Blood that drains life for
nourishment or self survival.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.233
As with all Fae.

05:20.446 --> 05:24.564
But the blood of your father,
whoever he may be, allows you

05:24.783 --> 05:28.241
to draw life from many
victims, and more importantly,

05:28.454 --> 05:32.743
to transfer that life force
to someone other than yourself.

05:32.958 --> 05:33.822
You have inherited
the abilities

05:34.043 --> 05:37.251
of both your mother
and your father.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.579
l have hybrid blood?

05:39.798 --> 05:43.962
Blood that I fear will
help your father escape.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.884
Not only can your
blood lift curses,

05:46.096 --> 05:47.347
but you could lead armies.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.592
Resurrect the fallen as
they die on the battlefield.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.014
Free the masses.

05:51.227 --> 05:55.095
Or enslave them, if she's
coerced by the wrong hand.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.179
Stop talking about
me like I'm not here.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.014
Nobody's going to
use me for anything.

05:59.235 --> 06:00.771
Do you understand?

06:01.570 --> 06:03.526
So what now?

06:03.739 --> 06:05.149
We check out this portal.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.652
No. Whoever your father is,
that's exactly what he wants;

06:07.868 --> 06:10.450
for you to be the instrument
of escape for his prison.

06:10.663 --> 06:12.403
Then where do
you suggest I go?

06:12.623 --> 06:14.363
Why not swing by my place?

06:14.583 --> 06:16.448
It's where I've
got your blonde box.

06:16.669 --> 06:19.001
Though she's more of a
walking medical kit, really.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.044
What the hell do
you want with Lauren?

06:21.257 --> 06:24.249
Oh my dear Magic Muff,
all I want is you,

06:24.468 --> 06:28.211
dead, at the Morrigan's feet.

06:33.602 --> 06:34.591
Kenzi! What's going on?

06:34.812 --> 06:36.768
Her blood is everywhere, she
left her cell phone behind,

06:36.981 --> 06:37.811
and she was
obviously looking for

06:38.023 --> 06:39.559
something in the Dark Archives.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.766
And check this out.

06:43.946 --> 06:44.696
Bo.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.520
Who else.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.571
And Lauren? What happened here?

06:48.784 --> 06:50.320
I don't know.

06:50.536 --> 06:53.903
First of all, | goosed
her sweet berries.

06:54.123 --> 06:55.704
Right where you're sitting.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.703
Ew. Graphic and confusing.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.750
How do I control
the temperature in here.

07:00.963 --> 07:02.919
It is freezing
one minute and then

07:03.132 --> 07:06.169
summer in
Palm Springs the next.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.717
Fae menopause?

07:08.929 --> 07:12.547
No... She's human.

07:14.810 --> 07:15.390
(pOW)

07:15.603 --> 07:16.934
Ow!

07:17.146 --> 07:18.727
God, I've been waiting
three years to do that.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.054
What is with all the punching?!

07:20.274 --> 07:22.310
I finally get what
"not in the face" means!

07:22.526 --> 07:24.232
How is it that you are human?

07:24.445 --> 07:27.733
Champers for the good Doctor
and her miracle snatch.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.449
Normally I would
have her incinerated,

07:29.658 --> 07:31.194
but my son took her.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.446
And I need Lauren. Alive.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.745
She's the only one
who can fix... this.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.198
W-Woah. You have a son?

07:39.418 --> 07:40.578
Is it Vex?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.580
As if I'd let him wear that

07:42.796 --> 07:47.460
too-old-to-be-goth
shit if it was. Massimo.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.507
Are you kidding me?!

07:49.720 --> 07:52.553
What can I say, Wall Street
in the 80s was totally gnarly.

07:52.765 --> 07:55.347
A weak moment with a human
led to birthing an infection.

07:55.559 --> 07:58.050
Who has become more dangerous
than a mutating plague.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.056
| locked him up
myself, in the Dal.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.604
No, Vex let him out.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.193
That little shit.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.563
Where would Massimo
have taken Lauren?

08:07.780 --> 08:09.566
Where he always goes
to lick his wounds

08:09.782 --> 08:11.522
when things don't go his way.

08:11.742 --> 08:14.779
Which they never do,
because he totally sucks.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.407
Ever since he was a little
boy, with his adorable curls

08:17.623 --> 08:21.332
and his... hugs. Ugh.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.329
He wanted to be one of us;

08:23.545 --> 08:25.081
instead, he taught
himself about our ways;

08:25.297 --> 08:27.162
surrounded himself with
the secrets of the Dark.

08:27.383 --> 08:29.465
The Archives.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.633
And what does
he want now, Evony?

08:31.845 --> 08:36.464
What all the boys
want, darling. Me.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.387
Evony sent you?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.762
Well you give her a message.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.268
As much as I can't
wait to tear you apart

08:46.485 --> 08:48.976
for what you did to Hale,
lam busy dealing with

08:49.196 --> 08:52.984
a rising army of the
dead and a real bad guy.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.942
You want this to get real bad?

08:56.161 --> 09:01.281
Have you ever heard of
a Raiju; a thunder beast?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.081
Because I have.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.829
And I took this from her.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.162
(magic shooshing)

09:09.633 --> 09:11.919
(pOW)

09:15.347 --> 09:17.133
(crash)

09:17.349 --> 09:18.964
Ugh!

09:19.184 --> 09:21.971
What's the matter, Bo-Bo?
Looking a little peaked.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.848
Why don't you have a seat?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.850
(splintering wood)

09:26.066 --> 09:26.816
Ungh!

09:27.025 --> 09:29.402
(clatter)

09:29.611 --> 09:31.021
The Seed.

09:33.699 --> 09:35.655
(grunt)

09:35.868 --> 09:37.574
Ugh!

09:37.786 --> 09:40.493
You stole the
Seed from my vault!

09:40.706 --> 09:44.449
And I swallowed
it whole. Yum yum.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.835
l'll deal with the Druid!

09:49.047 --> 09:54.258
No. She'll need you.
You owe me this at least!

09:54.470 --> 09:56.631
And who the hell are you?

09:57.306 --> 09:57.715
(crunch)

09:57.931 --> 10:00.468
Auuugh!

10:00.684 --> 10:03.517
Tell the Valkyrie
my soul is hers again.

10:05.397 --> 10:08.639
This is gonna be fun.

10:08.859 --> 10:11.225
I'm sorry. For everything--

10:11.445 --> 10:12.230
(neck snapping)

10:12.446 --> 10:14.937
No!

10:15.949 --> 10:21.945
Oh god, his foresight.
It's too powerful!

10:23.457 --> 10:28.076
(whimpering)

10:30.297 --> 10:32.413
He's gone.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.846
How did I get here?

10:50.067 --> 10:52.399
Trick's stronger than he looks.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.066
Oh. Groovy.

10:57.282 --> 11:00.069
He went to the Light Fae
library to get some text that

11:00.285 --> 11:04.028
he thinks has information
on the soldiers of Hel.

11:04.248 --> 11:09.459
Oh god. Rainer.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.002
You're pretty beat up.

11:12.214 --> 11:15.957
I figure, a few broken
ribs, busted collarbone.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.964
Where's a hot Kitsune med
student when you need one, huh?

11:22.766 --> 11:27.305
Hale. Rainer.
I couldn't save them.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.432
And Lauren has been
taken by some asshole

11:29.648 --> 11:31.934
that I can't
even get close to.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.142
I let everybody down.
I don't even know what to do.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.899
Why don't you suck it up
and get your shit together?

11:38.115 --> 11:38.979
Excuse me?

11:39.199 --> 11:40.700
Yeah it sucks to be the leader,
it sucks to be the queen,

11:40.909 --> 11:42.524
it sucks sucks
sucks. Get over it!

11:42.744 --> 11:43.449
How dare you!

11:43.662 --> 11:45.152
Oh poor me,
I'm the chosen one.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.158
Why don't you
act like it for once?

11:58.468 --> 12:03.553
You taste different. Happy.

12:03.765 --> 12:07.883
There'll be time
to mourn. Later.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.344
Look, I am still not strong
enough to defeat Massimo.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.101
He's basically
invincible. He won't die.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.433
Well we'll have
fun trying to make him.

12:15.652 --> 12:19.861
Over and over again.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.406
(footsteps)

12:23.619 --> 12:25.530
You guys okay?

12:33.712 --> 12:35.077
Hi.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.750
Hi.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.880
Well, that was awkward.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.712
Armageddon can be.
Just ask Ben and Liv.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.673
You have to forgive her, Kenz.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.133
Life is too short.

12:49.353 --> 12:52.595
Yeah, I remember, my
boyfriend just died. Thanks.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.270
And Rainer is also dead.

12:54.483 --> 12:57.566
Which means I have his
soul, and a second chance

12:57.778 --> 12:59.564
to deliver it where I should
have in the first place.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.567
It could end my
exile from Valhalla.

13:05.202 --> 13:06.817
That was that
bitch, Rosette's.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.323
And it's in Norwegian, right?

13:09.539 --> 13:11.666
This drawing. Gates
closing over flames.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.206
People cheering. What is this?

13:13.418 --> 13:14.578
A sale at lkea?

13:17.339 --> 13:19.705
Can you translate
this part for me?

13:22.010 --> 13:23.796
Daughter. Heart.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.674
As in, the daughter's
heart will close the portal?

13:26.890 --> 13:28.676
Do you think that
means Bo has to

13:28.892 --> 13:31.634
rip her heart
out of her chest?

13:32.396 --> 13:35.388
Let's not tell Bo. Yet.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.349
Let's get Lauren first. Okay?

13:38.568 --> 13:39.648
Okay.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.288
Lauren comes first.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.619
And your father?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.670
Daddy Darko waited
thirty years to show up,

14:00.882 --> 14:02.383
he can wait another hour.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.457
We get Lauren, or we get dead.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.088
Whatever it takes.

14:06.304 --> 14:09.512
I do need something
from you though.

14:09.725 --> 14:12.512
No, not that, I
already fed off Tamsin.

14:12.728 --> 14:15.344
Really.

14:15.564 --> 14:19.477
If I'm gonna stand half a
chance at beating Massimo,

14:19.693 --> 14:23.060
I need to get back to
myself. And I need a witness.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.816
That's your Dark Fae contract.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.988
Rainer had it
on him when he...

14:28.744 --> 14:32.783
And now Rainer's dead.
The Una Mens are dead.

14:32.998 --> 14:36.206
Everyone is dead except
for the guy who should be.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.500
And now so are my
ties with the Dark.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.452
Bo, I don't think
that's gonna work.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.960
No piece of paper is
gonna tell me who I am.

14:44.176 --> 14:46.542
Are you okay?

14:46.762 --> 14:48.969
Rainer was my partner;
someone who wanted to

14:49.181 --> 14:51.137
end the tyranny
between Light and Dark.

14:51.349 --> 14:55.592
He was a good man, Dyson,
who made a terrible mistake.

14:58.190 --> 15:01.933
| see now why
Hale was so grounded.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.143
Because he had a purpose.

15:06.031 --> 15:09.990
All my life l have been
searching for a King.

15:10.202 --> 15:13.410
When what I should have
been searching for is a Queen.

15:21.922 --> 15:29.215
My blood is yours.
My soul. My body.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.637
I swear fealty to you, |sabeau.

15:32.849 --> 15:38.469
Because no matter where you
come from or what made you,

15:38.688 --> 15:45.480
by your side is where
I want to be. Forever.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.867
I kinda thought
we were fighting.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.741
We kind of were.

16:03.547 --> 16:05.458
I love you.

16:08.051 --> 16:13.091
And that is why I need you
to serve with me, not for me.

16:17.144 --> 16:20.728
(coughing)

16:20.939 --> 16:25.433
Sorry, um... we found
out some more stuff...

16:25.652 --> 16:28.234
about the portal.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.903
The book's calling
it a "Cinvat."

16:31.116 --> 16:34.483
And it's at the Spiritual
Center for crazy pony ladies.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.159
So what do you say cowboy?

16:37.372 --> 16:39.784
Should we break some fillies?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.410
Giddy up.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.631
So this is what a
portal to the underworld

16:53.847 --> 16:55.212
looks like these days.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.889
Yeah. It's kinda hard to miss.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.968
Horse heads, broken
bits of carousels.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.144
Daddy's got a flair
for the drama, huh?

17:03.356 --> 17:04.971
Go big or go Hel.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.275
What do you think's gonna
come out of that thing?

17:10.822 --> 17:13.199
Shitloads of revenants.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.953
(gasping)

17:24.169 --> 17:26.000
Bo, don't!

17:35.972 --> 17:40.306
I am your Queen, whether
you swear it or not, fool.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.429
And my true army cometh.

17:50.987 --> 17:55.151
l was bound by blood.
Now we bathe in it.

17:55.367 --> 18:00.077
Humans. Fae. All
will bow before me.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.155
Bo, come back to me, please!

18:03.375 --> 18:08.369
All will break beneath
the power of the Pyrripus...

18:08.588 --> 18:09.919
Dyson. I can't stop.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.086
Fight it!

18:11.299 --> 18:12.539
Dyson, do something!

18:21.851 --> 18:23.227
Oh, you need some new moves.

18:23.436 --> 18:23.970
ReaHy?

18:24.187 --> 18:25.267
Works every time.

18:25.480 --> 18:30.099
Turning me off instead
of turning me on?

18:30.318 --> 18:31.694
(g rowls)

18:31.903 --> 18:33.768
You ready for a threesome?

18:33.989 --> 18:36.196
And you're saying
I need new material?

18:40.287 --> 18:42.869
Oh relax.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.823
You're gonna wear
out your big boy pants.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.248
You know when
you smirk like that,

18:47.460 --> 18:50.327
it really brings out
the lines around your eyes.

18:50.547 --> 18:57.089
Oh Patrick. You are as
witty as you are powerful.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.010
How come we've never...?

18:59.222 --> 19:01.133
You're not really my type.

19:01.349 --> 19:02.964
Because I'm human?

19:03.184 --> 19:03.969
(gaSPS)

19:04.185 --> 19:06.221
A mother?!

19:06.438 --> 19:07.678
A stone cold bitch.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.479
Oh, boo. Bitch is
just a word men use

19:10.692 --> 19:13.650
when they feel threatened
by the chick in charge.

19:13.862 --> 19:19.482
I'm not going to apologize for
being smart, or ambitious...

19:19.701 --> 19:22.067
Or trying to kill
everyone I love?

19:22.287 --> 19:24.653
Please. If your
grand-slaughter's Dad

19:24.873 --> 19:27.489
is who you're too
scared to say he is,

19:27.709 --> 19:30.621
we're all gonna
be Bo-Be-que'd anyway.

19:30.837 --> 19:35.581
Might as well have a
little fun first. Hmm?

19:35.800 --> 19:38.212
There's gotta be another way.

19:38.428 --> 19:42.091
Resurrect the Terracotta
Army? Dig up the Sharur?

19:42.307 --> 19:44.764
There's only one way
to close the gates of Hel,

19:44.976 --> 19:48.309
and it's not going to involve
a mythical talking mace.

19:48.521 --> 19:53.857
Think old man. How do
these things usually work?

19:54.069 --> 19:57.436
Souvent, une petite chose
jette une grande ombre.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.988
Sometimes the smallest thing
casts the longest shadow.

20:04.079 --> 20:06.070
We just gonna
sit here and wait for

20:06.289 --> 20:09.577
enslavement, chaos, anarchy?

20:09.793 --> 20:11.158
Because we're
almost out of booze.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.413
Hardly.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.416
Oh. What is that feeling?

20:15.632 --> 20:19.341
The sense that, for once,
you're doing the right thing?

20:21.262 --> 20:23.002
l have a wedgie.

20:23.223 --> 20:26.090
God, being human sucks.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.470
Still, if I'm gonna go out,

20:28.686 --> 20:31.098
I am gonna go
out looking fabulous.

20:31.314 --> 20:37.275
Trust me, you do.
Ready for this?

20:37.487 --> 20:40.399
A mother's work
is never done.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.444
Neither's a grandfather's.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.075
Well that was athletic.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.577
Dyson, that was three.
How many cursed souls

20:52.794 --> 20:55.080
have died on the
battle fields of history?

20:55.296 --> 20:56.456
Millions.

20:56.673 --> 20:59.130
About that kiss...

20:59.342 --> 21:00.457
Should I say I'm sorry.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.633
For what, saving me?

21:02.846 --> 21:04.336
Are you okay?

21:04.556 --> 21:07.138
Yeah. I feel awesome.

21:11.354 --> 21:16.144
Dyson, my father is
close. I feel so powerful.

21:16.359 --> 21:19.442
You're channeling his
energy through the portal.

21:19.654 --> 21:20.860
Can you control it?

21:21.072 --> 21:23.449
Maybe it's time I got
a little out of control.

21:23.658 --> 21:26.274
That's good to hear.
Because she needs you.

21:26.494 --> 21:28.735
You're not going to
tell me to save the world

21:28.955 --> 21:30.035
instead of the girl?

21:30.248 --> 21:34.992
You've taught me well.
And she's my friend too.

21:35.211 --> 21:36.587
My father is going
to keep sending

21:36.796 --> 21:38.206
those things
out of the portal

21:38.423 --> 21:40.755
to try and bait me.
I need you to contain

21:40.967 --> 21:43.925
the dead warriors that
come out of that Cinvat.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.048
Do not let them
get above ground.

21:46.264 --> 21:47.800
Have Tamsin cast
doubt over them.

21:48.016 --> 21:50.849
Make them go at
each others' throats.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.596
And then tear them out.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.053
With pleasure.

21:55.273 --> 21:56.854
And what about Kenzi?

21:57.066 --> 22:05.110
Keep her close. Keep her
safe. Can you do all that?

22:05.325 --> 22:07.987
Hold back the armies of Hel?

22:08.203 --> 22:11.115
I thought you would
never ask, my Queen.

22:51.204 --> 22:51.909
Kenzi--

23:11.558 --> 23:12.923
You're gonna be fine.

23:40.295 --> 23:44.163
(chains clinking)

23:44.382 --> 23:47.374
lam Evony's son.

23:48.344 --> 23:51.757
l was burned alive
for seven days.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.806
I can handle
the Wanderer's gift.

23:55.018 --> 23:58.602
You have Rainer's foresight?
What did you do to him?

23:58.813 --> 24:01.099
Pain is a cleanser.

24:01.316 --> 24:03.477
So much pain!

24:03.693 --> 24:05.229
I hope you choke on it.

24:05.445 --> 24:09.438
l have absorbed
all things Fae.

24:09.657 --> 24:12.273
l have knowledge
you can only dream of.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.984
You are a psycho loser with
a brain full of shit that

24:15.204 --> 24:17.911
you don't even
know how to use.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.957
And it sounds like you might
be allergic to Origin Seed.

24:21.169 --> 24:23.410
I got your epi-pen right here.

24:23.630 --> 24:24.415
What'd ya say, Druid?

24:24.631 --> 24:26.667
A little prick
to end a big prick?

24:26.883 --> 24:27.588
Are you okay?

24:27.800 --> 24:28.789
You shouldn't have come.

24:29.010 --> 24:31.046
| always do.

24:31.262 --> 24:32.877
Thank goddess.

24:33.097 --> 24:34.758
Lovers' laments
before you both die.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.430
What do you know about love?

24:36.643 --> 24:39.259
I know that Mother
is obsessed with you.

24:39.479 --> 24:40.514
And you're obsessed with her.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.971
Gee. I wonder
why you're single.

24:43.191 --> 24:46.604
She is hard on me because
she wants me to be the best.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.231
And now I am.

24:49.447 --> 24:54.066
The Una Mens is able to
deflect power of any Fae

24:54.285 --> 24:56.116
that dared to challenge them.

24:56.329 --> 25:03.041
And l have absorbed
all their powers, sixfold.

25:03.252 --> 25:06.790
It is a nifty bag
of tricks to choose from.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.667
You are a monster.

25:08.883 --> 25:13.252
Let's start with a tribute
from my last kill, as a human.

25:13.471 --> 25:17.840
A pretty little ditty
from your favorite Siren!

25:18.059 --> 25:19.424
(whistling)

25:19.644 --> 25:21.976
Ugh!

25:22.188 --> 25:23.223
Ah!

25:26.776 --> 25:30.234
Destiny. Boo yah.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.111
(grunts)

25:36.327 --> 25:37.783
Stop it! She's had enough!

25:37.995 --> 25:42.034
Why are you telling me?
She's the one who won't quit.

25:42.250 --> 25:43.956
Let her go.

25:44.168 --> 25:45.749
I like an audience.

25:45.962 --> 25:49.580
Did you know you're going
to breathe your dying breath,

25:49.799 --> 25:53.087
helpless, watching
me kill the good doctor?

25:53.302 --> 25:55.463
You have a very
rich fantasy life.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.045
I can see the battle ahead.

25:57.265 --> 26:03.056
Courtesy of... I've already
forgotten his name.

26:03.271 --> 26:04.101
Owwwww.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.177
You okay?

26:05.398 --> 26:06.729
Two minutes, I'll
be out of these cuffs.

26:06.941 --> 26:08.021
Seriously?

26:08.234 --> 26:09.849
I learned a lot from
Kenzi's shadow thief training.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.650
It's not all
just panty removal.

26:11.863 --> 26:14.195
Your foreplay
was always top notch.

26:15.491 --> 26:21.077
Whew! Ding ding ding!
Ready for round three?

26:21.289 --> 26:24.156
First thing's first.
Let's kill this motherlover.

26:24.375 --> 26:27.458
When in doubt,
go with the classics.

26:28.629 --> 26:38.049
(gasping)

26:38.264 --> 26:41.756
Woo! You almost had me there.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.843
Must have a little something
extra in the slutty tank today.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.269
Yeah, it's called the
coming apocalypse, dick.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.313
Now if you would just
die like a good boy,

26:49.525 --> 26:51.231
I could get back
to dealing with it.

26:51.444 --> 26:55.938
You know... your origins
are fascinating, Succubus.

26:56.157 --> 26:57.897
"The power of the Pyrripus."

26:58.117 --> 26:59.653
What do you know about it?

26:59.869 --> 27:02.451
I know that being raised
by humans made you soft.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.995
I know that the Keeper was
right to warn you of the shit

27:05.208 --> 27:06.744
that is coming your way.

27:06.959 --> 27:07.869
(panting)

27:08.085 --> 27:11.213
Feels pretty crappy,
doesn't it 30-30?

27:11.422 --> 27:15.506
Being helpless? Being mortal?

27:16.886 --> 27:19.593
Is that how you've
felt all these years?

27:19.806 --> 27:21.262
Mom?!

27:24.352 --> 27:26.889
This is not what
Trick and I discussed.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.310
Collateral damage.

27:28.523 --> 27:31.390
Looks like once again,
only I will choose who lives

27:31.609 --> 27:33.941
and who dies.

27:34.153 --> 27:39.568
(shrieking)

27:39.784 --> 27:41.866
I've never actually seen
a Valkyrie in battle before.

27:42.078 --> 27:43.238
lt's impressive.

27:43.454 --> 27:45.786
Got anything under that
codpiece worth fighting for?

27:45.998 --> 27:46.908
You should know.

27:47.124 --> 27:49.740
(fighting)

27:49.961 --> 27:51.872
What are all these hell spawn?

27:52.088 --> 27:53.294
The first of millions.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.748
(fighting)

27:56.968 --> 27:58.583
You know if we don't
get out of here--

27:58.803 --> 27:59.588
Shut up!

27:59.804 --> 28:02.090
I'm just saying.
We're outnumbered.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.171
Two against
the scourges of Hel?

28:04.392 --> 28:05.381
Three.

28:07.270 --> 28:09.477
Time to stop
dwelling in the past.

28:10.314 --> 28:12.270
And get to
fixing the future.

28:12.483 --> 28:13.984
Where's Kenzi?

28:14.193 --> 28:15.729
Safe.

28:15.945 --> 28:17.060
For now.

28:18.155 --> 28:21.613
(screaming)

28:21.826 --> 28:24.442
You let her go or I'll
blow your bitch brains

28:24.662 --> 28:26.277
all over your
girlfriend's face.

28:26.497 --> 28:29.830
Ugh, terrible. Who
taught you to threaten?

28:30.042 --> 28:33.375
Yum. I bet human
mommy tastes delicious.

28:33.588 --> 28:36.625
Delectable. But don't
take my word for it.

28:42.305 --> 28:44.136
Don't you hurt her!

28:47.476 --> 28:50.764
Oh, I can taste how
she really feels about you.

28:50.980 --> 28:54.814
Coward. Pathetic. Mistake.

28:55.026 --> 28:57.017
(frustrated cries)

29:05.036 --> 29:08.699
See, it's not just sucking
chi that makes me special.

29:08.915 --> 29:11.748
It's that I
learned how to stop.

29:11.959 --> 29:14.041
For ten years, I went
on a killing spree.

29:14.253 --> 29:18.542
And then I found my friends.
You think you know love?

29:18.758 --> 29:21.716
Use it to save her.

29:21.928 --> 29:25.295
Go on. Save her!

29:25.514 --> 29:27.379
I could breathe
chi back into her.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.136
But you don't
have that power yet.

29:29.352 --> 29:31.468
No matter how much you care.

29:38.486 --> 29:39.896
Mommy!

29:43.658 --> 29:45.649
Make it better.

29:45.868 --> 29:49.110
I'll need someone
else's chi to do that.

29:49.330 --> 29:54.165
A life for a life.
That is the Fae way.

29:54.377 --> 30:05.629
(gasping)

30:05.846 --> 30:07.097
(coughing)

30:12.853 --> 30:15.435
You can't hurt me.
You can't kill me.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.980
I've got--

30:18.192 --> 30:20.649
A tiny twig?

30:20.861 --> 30:23.147
And Hale's last gift.

30:23.364 --> 30:25.901
You think that's
what stopped me?

30:26.117 --> 30:28.824
I've got other plans for you.

30:30.079 --> 30:31.819
Well Daddy's coming to play.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.496
And you're gonna
both gonna die anyway.

30:34.709 --> 30:37.917
At least we'll die a family.

30:38.129 --> 30:39.744
(pOW)

30:39.964 --> 30:41.920
That is for laying
a finger on Lauren.

30:42.133 --> 30:43.248
Augh!

30:43.467 --> 30:44.673
For Rainer.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.429
For Hale.

30:47.638 --> 30:49.253
(stabbing sound)

30:49.473 --> 30:53.216
And that is for
breaking Kenzi's heart.

31:02.236 --> 31:04.693
It's okay.
It's okay, I got you.

31:25.468 --> 31:28.756
Kenzi! What
are you doing here?

31:28.971 --> 31:30.586
Can't wait any longer.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.182
We're outnumbered
and you're injured.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.767
We have to fight.
We have to keep fighting.

31:33.976 --> 31:36.217
We have to close the portal.

31:36.437 --> 31:37.517
We don't know how.

31:37.730 --> 31:42.224
Dyson, | get it now.
I do have a part to play.

31:42.443 --> 31:43.808
What are you talking about?

31:48.991 --> 31:51.277
It is the only way to
close the gateway to Hel.

31:51.494 --> 31:52.950
lt's Bo's heart.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.371
And I'm it.

32:04.882 --> 32:07.214
You wore it.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.041
I love it.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.376
And Rainer?

32:10.596 --> 32:12.632
You were wrong about him.

32:14.642 --> 32:17.179
At least I was right about you.

32:17.394 --> 32:22.184
Always have been. Since
the first moment we met.

32:22.399 --> 32:25.766
And I've always known
you were extraordinary.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.728
But now, a human doctor
who can turn the Fae mortal?

32:28.948 --> 32:30.563
They're gonna
be coming for you.

32:30.783 --> 32:33.445
Yeah? Let 'em try.

32:33.661 --> 32:35.151
You really are Dark.

32:35.371 --> 32:37.236
No, Bo.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.489
I'm yours.

32:43.337 --> 32:45.623
We have to go.

32:45.840 --> 32:49.458
My father, portal
to Hel, Tamsin and Dyson

32:49.677 --> 32:53.716
and Kenzi, oh god, Kenzi.

32:53.931 --> 32:59.392
I'm going to stay. Evony's
stable, and you know... just--

32:59.603 --> 33:02.310
Hippocratic oath and all that.

33:02.523 --> 33:04.388
Shit, you're serious.

33:04.608 --> 33:07.771
You saw her, all
vulnerable and human.

33:07.987 --> 33:11.605
And, you know, I kind
of did this to her, so...

33:11.824 --> 33:16.739
Craziest thing of all?
I actually get it.

33:16.954 --> 33:21.368
Get out of here, Succubus.
Destiny's calling.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.188
Dyson! There's too many!

33:51.405 --> 33:52.861
Bo's heart is her heart.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.734
It's never that
simple with you Fae!

33:54.950 --> 33:57.202
It is always a
metaphor, a symbol.

33:57.411 --> 33:58.867
Dyson, it's me.

33:59.079 --> 34:01.821
Kenzi, the Cinvat
is concentrated energy.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.156
Do you know what
it'll do to you?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.582
Bo is the only one
who can help us, Dyson.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.876
And she needs me to help her!

34:08.088 --> 34:09.999
No! I'll go.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.331
No, Dyson.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.257
She loves you, yes.
She loves Lauren.

34:14.470 --> 34:19.464
But you know that it's me.
I am her heart. You know that.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.389
Look, l have a plan, okay?

34:21.602 --> 34:23.217
Rainer, he had
the gift of foresight.

34:23.437 --> 34:26.019
He knew this would
happen-- had to happen.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.472
(screeching)

34:27.691 --> 34:30.774
Now Tamsin has his soul,
the golden ticket to Valhalla.

34:30.986 --> 34:32.442
That's where she'll take
me when this is all over,

34:32.655 --> 34:33.485
that's where I'll wait.

34:33.697 --> 34:34.777
No!

34:34.990 --> 34:38.858
Yes, Dyson. lf can I go
out like this, a warrior...

34:39.078 --> 34:41.319
in battle...

34:41.538 --> 34:45.406
Maybe I'll even get
to see him... again...

34:47.086 --> 34:49.077
I will wait
for Bo in Valhalla.

34:49.296 --> 34:51.378
You know that she'll
never stop looking for me.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.457
She will never stop
fighting to bring me home.

34:54.677 --> 34:55.962
Something big is coming!

34:56.178 --> 34:57.714
The Pyrripus!

34:59.348 --> 35:01.430
It is the only way, Dyson.

35:01.642 --> 35:04.759
It is the only way
Bo can save the world!

35:18.158 --> 35:21.116
Oh Kenzi, no... No.

36:35.778 --> 36:37.018
No, no, no!

36:37.237 --> 36:37.942
Dyson, no.

36:38.155 --> 36:38.860
Kenzi!

36:39.073 --> 36:48.914
â€™33:;

36:49.124 --> 36:58.965
â€™33:;

36:59.176 --> 37:15.525
â€™33:;

37:21.573 --> 37:24.406
(sobbing)

37:31.125 --> 37:32.490
Valhalla.

38:19.423 --> 38:29.799
(sobbing)

39:08.347 --> 39:09.883
Tamsin!

39:11.141 --> 39:12.221
Come on Tamsin.

39:12.434 --> 39:14.720
Hey, hey, hey.

39:16.563 --> 39:19.225
No. You shouldn't be here!

39:19.441 --> 39:21.272
But I am.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.856
Kenzi...

39:26.073 --> 39:27.483
Yeah?

39:30.410 --> 39:32.196
She's gone.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.536
Hey, we'll get her back.

39:35.749 --> 39:37.285
No, no!

39:37.501 --> 39:41.585
You can't let Bo
find the second Hel-shoe.

39:41.797 --> 39:44.960
Why, Tamsin, why?
What did you see?

39:48.762 --> 39:53.927
Hey. Hey. It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

39:54.142 --> 39:55.678
I'm not leaving
you behind again.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.850
(whimpering)

39:58.063 --> 39:59.644
It's okay, it's okay.

40:01.275 --> 40:04.733
There. Come on.

40:58.165 --> 41:01.703
We buried Rainer near the
battlefield at Ancrum Moor.

41:04.379 --> 41:06.085
It only seemed right
he should rest with those

41:06.298 --> 41:08.789
who fought and died for him.

41:21.063 --> 41:23.805
There has been
too much dying already.

41:24.024 --> 41:25.264
It's been hard.

41:36.078 --> 41:38.694
l have lost so much.

41:39.539 --> 41:42.030
But I have to be strong.

41:51.134 --> 41:52.294
Now more than ever.

42:17.411 --> 42:23.407
I miss you. But more
than that, I need you.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.126
I need your courage.

42:39.182 --> 42:42.174
But I am done crying.

42:42.394 --> 42:45.010
I am done being scared.

42:46.440 --> 42:49.227
No one else
will die on my watch.

42:51.278 --> 42:55.112
Whatever it takes,
I will get you back.

42:56.616 --> 42:59.983
They want me to be afraid?

43:00.203 --> 43:04.321
lt's them who
should be afraid.

43:04.541 --> 43:05.781
Of me.
