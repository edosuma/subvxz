WEBVTT

01:44.437 --> 01:45.571
Huh?

01:46.773 --> 01:48.207
I'm so happy.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.443
I love spring in the ice age.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.113
Oh, the colors,
the changing of seasons!

01:56.716 --> 01:59.451
Yeah, I hardly
recognize the place.

01:59.453 --> 02:03.322
Of course, spring doesn't really
start until the eggs hatch. And...

02:03.324 --> 02:06.291
And you can't start Easter
without our Easter feast.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.393
That's right, with the
family all together.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.763
Which sounds amazing! But I
made plans with my friends.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.567
Someday you're gonna have
a family of your own...

02:15.569 --> 02:17.269
And then you'll know
the importance of

02:17.271 --> 02:19.238
getting everyone
together on the holidays.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.520
I don't even know
if I want that.

02:23.409 --> 02:26.378
Manny, come out here! Your
daughter is talking nonsense!

02:26.380 --> 02:28.213
Honey!

02:28.215 --> 02:31.316
I'm in my Manny cave watching
the hawks-bears game.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.358
I'll help when I get back.

02:34.387 --> 02:35.554
Promise.

02:37.257 --> 02:38.690
Oh!

02:39.292 --> 02:39.291
Come on, hawks!

02:39.293 --> 02:42.294
<i>This is it,
folks, it's sudden death.</i>

02:43.145 --> 02:44.164
Guys, every time?

02:44.165 --> 02:47.566
<i>They're in
formation and here they go!</i>

02:47.568 --> 02:48.800
Bears rule!

02:48.802 --> 02:51.203
Whoo-hoo!
Hawks on the attack!

02:51.205 --> 02:52.704
<i>Here
comes fuzzy wuzzy. He...</i>

02:52.706 --> 02:54.239
- Ooh!
<i>- Holy mastodon!</i>

02:54.241 --> 02:55.707
That was sudden!

02:55.709 --> 02:56.942
Game over. Hawks lose.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.214
Why don't you guys go help your
sister with the Easter feast?

03:02.216 --> 03:04.249
Easter, Sschmeaster,
chicken Keister!

03:04.251 --> 03:05.817
Possums are launching
our own holiday.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.786
April possum day!

03:07.788 --> 03:11.323
A celebration of all
things prank and possum.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.959
If it's about you guys, why
not call it April fools'?

03:13.961 --> 03:16.328
Ouch! I like it.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.665
Now, who will be the first fool?

03:19.667 --> 03:22.501
Peaches! Yeah, that's
what I was thinking.

03:22.503 --> 03:26.572
Manny! I could use
another trunk up here!

03:26.574 --> 03:29.274
Let's go watch the falcons-hornets
game at your den.

03:29.276 --> 03:32.244
Yeah, but Shira's sleeping. She went
out all night hunting with the girls.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.679
The cougars?

03:33.681 --> 03:35.601
Fine, we'll watch at Sid's.
Bring the nose plugs.

03:39.852 --> 03:42.854
Wow, guys, I'm touched you want
to watch the game with me, but...

03:44.490 --> 03:48.260
I can't because, you see,
it's my grand opening!

03:48.262 --> 03:50.696
Nothing about you is grand, Sid.

03:50.698 --> 03:54.299
Well, if you recall, I once ran
a kid's camp, <i>El campo Del Sid.</i>

03:54.301 --> 03:55.734
Disaster.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.970
And then I nurtured three
beautiful dinosaur eggs.

03:57.972 --> 03:57.970
Disaster.

03:57.972 --> 04:03.442
And then I thought, who has time
to sit on their egg all day?

04:03.444 --> 04:06.845
Me! So, I'm opening
a pre-hatched pre-school.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.948
Egg sitting.
I sit on your egg.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.650
Future disaster.

04:11.652 --> 04:14.486
Wow. And not one
single parent

04:14.488 --> 04:16.288
has entrusted
their egg to you yet.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.755
No, can you believe that?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.558
And I asked everyone, too.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.462
- Asher, stop sniffing him.
- It's embarrassing!

04:23.464 --> 04:24.464
Except her!

04:25.999 --> 04:28.767
Please, give me strength.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.737
Ahhh! Don't eat that,
it's already digested.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.672
Uh, excuse me, ma'am?
Hmm?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.774
I can't help noticing that you
just migrated... Savannah!

04:35.776 --> 04:38.944
So you know nothing about me.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.445
Savan... mmm-mmm.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.348
- Rachel!
- It wasn't me!

04:43.350 --> 04:45.751
The skinny one! Spit your brother out!
Right now!

04:45.753 --> 04:45.751
What on earth are you saying?

04:45.753 --> 04:50.622
I know it's hard to manage, what,
with today's two-hunter families.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.958
Only one hunter here.
My mate flew the Coop.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.559
That's great!
What?

04:54.561 --> 04:57.696
I mean, I mean,
I feel your pain.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.398
So, um, let me ask you...

04:59.400 --> 05:01.433
Who'll watch your egg
while you scavenge

05:01.435 --> 05:03.535
to feed your young
mouth to mouths?

05:03.537 --> 05:05.671
I'm basically your only option.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.913
And really, think about it.
What could possibly go wrong?

05:11.944 --> 05:14.346
Yo, I been stuck down here for
three months hangin' out.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.015
I got my sea legs back.
Time to set sail!

05:17.017 --> 05:20.319
Come on,
you just got home! Stay!

05:20.321 --> 05:21.887
We got it made here.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.856
We sleep all day,
we game all night.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.693
Mom, like, she picks up
all our droppings, dude.

05:27.695 --> 05:28.927
Can one of you
take out the trash?

05:28.929 --> 05:30.696
Mom! In a minute!

05:30.698 --> 05:32.397
I'm busy!

05:32.399 --> 05:33.999
I love that woman.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.601
Clint! This hole is
your whole universe.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.337
And that's cool. You're a late bloomer.
Whatever.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.572
I am a pirate.
I don't judge.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.108
But there's a whole world out
there to pillage and plunder.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.676
You can sit here
with your late bloomin',

05:44.678 --> 05:46.378
I'mma get to
pillage and plunderin'.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.946
Okay... well...

05:47.948 --> 05:49.915
Every time you scheme something,

05:49.917 --> 05:51.850
you end up back here,
at rock bottom.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.552
Yeah, but this time's
gonna be different.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.554
I'm gonna bounce.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.890
Here we go! What?

06:00.794 --> 06:01.794
It's them!

06:03.863 --> 06:04.863
Watch out!

06:05.631 --> 06:08.033
<i>They sank my ship!</i>

06:08.035 --> 06:10.595
<i>All because I tried to kidnap
and, well, maybe dump 'em at sea.</i>

06:13.573 --> 06:14.973
<i>Anti-pirate jerks.</i>

06:16.142 --> 06:17.976
Payback time.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.845
If you're going out,
take your brother!

06:19.847 --> 06:21.913
Mom! I'm not taking him!

06:23.950 --> 06:26.785
Of course I have space
for little Jessica!

06:26.787 --> 06:28.687
My motto is...

06:28.689 --> 06:31.890
"Long as you've got an egg,
I've got a place to sit."

06:33.394 --> 06:34.493
Next!

06:35.928 --> 06:36.995
Who referred you?

06:36.997 --> 06:38.897
Ethel did.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.534
She said you had the most
trustworthy eye she's ever seen.

06:42.536 --> 06:45.937
You see, my little egg is
my whole life, my miracle.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.443
Well, yeah!
I should say so.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.611
So, how did you, um...

06:52.613 --> 06:53.912
I adopted.

06:53.914 --> 06:54.914
Oh!

06:57.850 --> 06:59.718
Sid's got a dozen
eggs in his care.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.787
This is not gonna go over easy.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.556
It's like the future of the
ecosystem is in Sid's hands.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.691
Worse. It's under Sid's butt.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.762
Ew!

07:10.764 --> 07:13.632
Hey! You hose-faced, trunk-toothed beast!
Remember me?

07:13.634 --> 07:15.634
Peter cottontail?

07:15.636 --> 07:18.036
That is insulting to my species!

07:18.038 --> 07:19.571
I'm here for the new
ship you owe me!

07:19.573 --> 07:20.772
What are you talking about?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.974
Oh, let me refresh your memory.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.710
Last time we met, you beat,
outsmarted, and humiliated me.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.447
So the way I see it,
you owe me a new ship.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.582
Beat it, bunny.
I don't owe you bupkis.

07:31.017 --> 07:32.117
Ha-ha!

07:34.655 --> 07:35.887
What is he doing?

07:35.889 --> 07:38.690
I think...
He's attacking you?

07:38.692 --> 07:41.026
Attacking?
Exfoliating, maybe.

07:44.096 --> 07:47.065
Y'all haven't heard the last of me!
I'll be back for my new ship!

07:51.037 --> 07:53.238
Nap time!

07:53.240 --> 07:56.541
Oh, my gosh, you're so cute!

07:57.043 --> 08:00.579
Sleep, sleep.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.147
You want back tickles?

08:02.149 --> 08:04.583
Oh, you have a big day tomorrow!

08:04.585 --> 08:07.185
Now, how are you gonna come outta
your shell if you don't rest?

08:07.187 --> 08:09.488
Oh, I know!
I know, I know.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.823
I'll tell you the story my mom
used to tell me all the time.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.159
It puts me right to sleep.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.895
Okay. "Humpty dumpty
sat on a wall..."

08:20.266 --> 08:23.502
And the lucky bunny
stole them all.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.038
Oh, you're poached!

08:29.609 --> 08:32.609
"And all the king's horses
and all the king's..."

08:33.578 --> 08:35.499
Oh, I like your sunny side.
I'm gonna put you up!

08:37.616 --> 08:38.717
Egg roll!

08:46.592 --> 08:48.927
Tomorrow I'm gonna
cash in my nest egg

08:48.929 --> 08:50.929
for a big ol' pirate
ship to sail away in!

08:56.736 --> 09:00.138
First pranking is a rite of
passage for every possum.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.841
Peaches gets to be the first
April fool in history.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.543
She's gonna be so happy.

09:04.545 --> 09:05.677
Shh!

09:05.679 --> 09:06.845
Here she comes!

09:08.281 --> 09:09.881
We're the best uncles ever! Shh!

09:15.121 --> 09:16.121
But I...

09:16.756 --> 09:18.590
I don't get it!

09:18.592 --> 09:20.892
We set a vicious booby
trap for our niece.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.761
We did everything right here!

09:22.763 --> 09:24.563
Maybe your glue's no good.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.830
Told you my glue is good!

09:26.699 --> 09:27.699
Whoa!

09:29.235 --> 09:30.869
Crash?
What's happening?

09:32.271 --> 09:33.338
Eddie?

09:34.206 --> 09:35.907
Stop it!
You stop it!

09:36.776 --> 09:38.310
It's good glue.

09:38.312 --> 09:40.045
Thank you.
It's incredible!

09:47.219 --> 09:49.788
Where are our eggs?

09:49.790 --> 09:50.989
I don't think
he knows where the eggs are.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.223
I told you
we shouldn't trust him.

09:52.225 --> 09:55.193
Well, maybe it's
senior ditch day.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.095
How is that even possible?

09:57.097 --> 10:00.765
Wow, I mean, they are
deceptively quick for oblongs.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.634
You close your eyes for one
second and they wobble off.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.269
You lost them?

10:04.271 --> 10:08.840
I trusted you with my egg! And
I got them to trust you too!

10:08.842 --> 10:11.776
Do you have any idea,
as a single-parent dad...

10:11.778 --> 10:14.012
The hoops they made me
jump through to adopt?

10:14.014 --> 10:15.947
It took me all day
to lay my eggs!

10:15.949 --> 10:18.850
Have you ever given birth to
something that weighs half a ton?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.251
No.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.887
Sadly, nature hasn't seen it fit

10:22.889 --> 10:25.790
to bless me with
that experience.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.026
Well, you're about to
find out how it feels.

10:29.328 --> 10:30.362
Pull!

10:31.263 --> 10:35.000
Go ahead. I deserve it.

10:35.002 --> 10:38.169
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Please release the sloth.

10:39.739 --> 10:41.239
Look, look, we'll find your eggs

10:41.241 --> 10:43.008
and we'll get 'em
back by morning.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.610
Or you can draw and
quarter him tomorrow.

10:45.411 --> 10:46.878
I'm not saying they should.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.346
Can we tar and feather him?

10:48.348 --> 10:50.849
No! It'll get
all over my cave.

10:50.851 --> 10:51.950
What if we feed
him to the reptile!

10:51.952 --> 10:53.685
Get that horny toad!

10:53.687 --> 10:57.322
Look, I appreciate your ideas,
but Sid didn't take your eggs!

10:57.324 --> 10:58.857
Then who did?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.091
Hey, look!

11:00.093 --> 11:01.126
We found something!

11:01.827 --> 11:03.662
It's a ransom note.

11:03.664 --> 11:07.766
Get me a ship by tomorrow
or the eggs get scrambled.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.668
The pirate took our eggs!

11:09.670 --> 11:11.202
You brought this trouble here.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.405
Just give him a new ship!

11:13.407 --> 11:16.007
We can't negotiate with a pirate.
He'll just keep doing it.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.876
Wait, wait!

11:17.878 --> 11:19.878
It's the pirate!
Get him!

11:21.848 --> 11:23.782
Wait, wait, wait,
no, I'm not him!

11:23.784 --> 11:24.784
That's my brother.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.820
No, he hid this!
In our rabbit hole.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.189
It's a treasure map to the eggs.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.358
You see, pirates,
they like to hide things...

11:33.360 --> 11:36.161
And draw maps to find them, like, later.
I don't know.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.896
I know what pirates do.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.098
Why did you bring this to us?

11:40.100 --> 11:43.101
My family's made its hole in
this valley for 13 generations.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.170
That's almost four years!

11:45.172 --> 11:47.872
For once, I gotta make
things right. You know?

11:48.240 --> 11:49.974
For my family.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.276
We gotta get those eggs back.

11:54.847 --> 11:57.382
I napped, and they
got egg-napped.

11:58.919 --> 12:02.787
Manny, we have to
help those families.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.589
Sid, this is your chance
to make things right.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.325
Thanks, Ellie.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.294
You're wise beyond your size.

12:11.163 --> 12:13.064
Okay, we got ourselves
an egg hunt!

12:13.066 --> 12:14.966
Let's search every
tree hole, rabbit hole,

12:14.968 --> 12:16.301
watering hole, and ice hole...

12:16.303 --> 12:17.802
In this entire valley.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.405
We'll find 'em.
I promise.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.179
Hey, don't you want
to follow the map?

12:28.181 --> 12:29.814
Map, Schmap.

12:29.816 --> 12:33.251
We have a D.T.S.
Diego tracking system.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.054
My nose, and these
instincts, can't miss.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.455
They just did.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.324
Huh?

12:39.326 --> 12:42.761
According to this map we don't
need, there should be one right...

12:43.496 --> 12:44.996
Here!

12:44.998 --> 12:47.098
Eggs marks the spot.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.334
Painting and hiding eggs?

12:49.336 --> 12:51.970
It's insidious. Who
would do such a thing?

12:57.843 --> 12:59.911
This is like finding
an ice cube in a glacier.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.080
I found another one.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.486
All right, a little more
to the left. No, center.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.484
Okay, to the right, to the right.
Okay, no, no, no, no.

13:18.164 --> 13:20.684
Okay, a little more to the left,
a little south, a little south.

13:32.344 --> 13:35.079
It's chocolate. Should
weigh just about the same.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.337
Who knew that chocolate
tastes best in egg form?

13:46.826 --> 13:47.892
Whoa!

13:48.594 --> 13:50.495
Sid!

14:02.041 --> 14:03.875
Yeah! We got 'em all!

14:05.077 --> 14:06.845
Aw, Clint!

14:06.847 --> 14:09.207
Finally got off your cottontail
just to bite me in the back.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.483
Okay.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.019
Those traps are
on a hare-trigger.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.956
One goes off, they all go off!

14:17.958 --> 14:19.891
Soon as she comes up, pow!

14:20.192 --> 14:21.993
Genius!

14:21.995 --> 14:23.228
But why would she come here?

14:23.230 --> 14:25.163
Simple.
I left her a note.

14:25.464 --> 14:26.531
This note?

14:27.199 --> 14:28.433
Shoot.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.170
Looks like we might
be here for a while!

14:44.516 --> 14:45.884
My baby!

14:46.552 --> 14:48.486
My little miracle!

14:48.488 --> 14:51.022
I am not your miracle.
Could you just put me down?

14:51.024 --> 14:52.523
We can't panic like this.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.359
We've gotta panic like this!

14:54.361 --> 14:57.462
We're never gonna
see our eggs again!

14:57.464 --> 14:59.230
We gotta build him that ship.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.532
I know you're worried about your families.
I've been there.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.902
But my guys always come through.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.570
Look! It's them!

15:11.543 --> 15:12.543
They're back!

15:15.614 --> 15:18.182
Thank you!
Thank you, thank you!

15:18.184 --> 15:22.487
Neither ice, nor more ice,
nor dark of night...

15:22.489 --> 15:24.923
Would keep us from
returning every last egg.

15:25.391 --> 15:26.658
Huh?

15:26.660 --> 15:28.092
Except yours.

15:28.494 --> 15:29.594
My egg's missing?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.563
But we found every
egg on the map!

15:32.565 --> 15:35.600
Oh, no. My poor little egg!

15:35.602 --> 15:38.503
Never even got a chance
to drive me crazy!

15:38.505 --> 15:41.205
Oh, why? Why me?

15:41.207 --> 15:43.474
You fools!

15:43.476 --> 15:45.876
Oh, you really think I'm gonna
put all my eggs in one basket?

15:47.413 --> 15:49.981
You have until sunrise
to build me my ship...

15:49.983 --> 15:52.083
If you ever want to see
your precious egg again!

15:53.185 --> 15:54.285
Oh, no!

15:55.654 --> 15:58.056
It's one hour to sunrise.
We're not gonna make it.

15:58.058 --> 16:01.059
We still got
an hour. Our hour.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.127
Hour hour?
So that's two hours.

16:03.129 --> 16:07.231
No, it's the hour
that belongs to us!

16:07.233 --> 16:09.133
Look, despite new
evidence that suggests

16:09.135 --> 16:11.102
I should not work
in child care...

16:11.104 --> 16:16.040
When we work together,
we can fix any mistake I make.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.142
Sid's right.
Look, we had a setback.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.510
Let's start over
and get this done.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.147
Huh?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.416
Count me in.

16:30.255 --> 16:34.993
Dude, stop, all right? This is
kind of getting out of hand.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.295
I'm not giving up that egg,
Clint, not without a ship.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.131
What about our home?
Our family?

16:40.133 --> 16:43.401
What about us? Your
own fluff and blood.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.483
You gave up on loyalty the
moment you gave up my map!

16:45.571 --> 16:47.271
We're bunnies!

16:47.273 --> 16:49.574
Okay? We're soft,
we're cute, we're cuddly.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.076
We got button noses
and fluffy tails...

16:52.078 --> 16:55.413
Hand-crafted by nature
to make everybody go, "aw!"

16:55.415 --> 16:57.015
And you found a way
to make the whole

16:57.017 --> 16:58.616
animal kingdom
hate us in one day!

16:58.618 --> 17:00.618
You need everyone to love you!

17:00.620 --> 17:03.755
Here's you. "Oh, that's okay, I
don't need to be tough and strong.

17:03.757 --> 17:05.323
"I'll go hide in a hole."
That's you.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.624
Here's me.

17:06.626 --> 17:07.626
I win!

17:09.127 --> 17:11.628
Well, fine.
Have it your way.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.365
They built you a ship.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.607
They're doin'... They're buildin'...
They're building it?

17:17.469 --> 17:18.502
No!

17:20.740 --> 17:22.440
Hah! If you think
I'm gonna tell you

17:22.442 --> 17:24.308
where that egg is, you're nuts.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.377
The egg!

17:29.815 --> 17:31.049
Uh-oh.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.698
No!

17:47.700 --> 17:48.700
I got it, I got it!

17:51.670 --> 17:52.670
My nest egg!

17:55.607 --> 17:56.808
Head's up!
Come on!

17:59.144 --> 18:00.178
Oh!

18:02.781 --> 18:04.549
Surprise!

18:08.353 --> 18:09.387
Oh, please!

18:12.658 --> 18:13.658
Got it!

18:17.863 --> 18:19.530
Whoa!

18:19.532 --> 18:21.165
Did you see that?
I got it!

18:23.735 --> 18:24.735
My egg!

18:27.172 --> 18:28.840
Sid!
Sneak attack!

18:37.616 --> 18:38.616
Do-si-do!

18:41.520 --> 18:42.653
Spring thaw!

18:43.622 --> 18:44.789
The ice is melting!

18:49.628 --> 18:51.195
Give me that egg!

18:51.497 --> 18:52.530
Sid!

18:55.501 --> 18:56.534
Ah!

18:58.604 --> 18:59.604
Darn bunny tail!

19:09.582 --> 19:11.816
You're the first April fool!

19:11.818 --> 19:13.317
We did it!

19:14.520 --> 19:15.720
April fools!

19:19.324 --> 19:20.324
Oh!

19:21.660 --> 19:22.860
Mama.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.662
Thank you!

19:24.664 --> 19:26.297
Savannah!

19:26.299 --> 19:28.232
Come look at
your little brother.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.234
Oh, he's so cute!

19:32.671 --> 19:35.640
Oh, my goodness, aren't you
the most beautiful thing?

19:39.211 --> 19:40.578
My miracle!

19:41.580 --> 19:43.214
Mom! Look!

19:45.651 --> 19:46.851
Come here.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.388
Peaches?
Are you crying?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.191
You got me.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.926
Family's cool.

19:54.928 --> 19:57.361
You might even get to be
a grand-mammoth someday.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.663
Manny, come out here.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.665
Huh? What? What's wrong?

20:00.667 --> 20:03.267
Your daughter's finally
starting to make sense.

20:03.269 --> 20:06.237
Okay, I know you want to
be with your friends.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.573
And I know the eagles show is starting.
Go watch with Diego.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.374
No way.
Yeah, mom.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.410
We're having Easter
feast all together.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.545
As a family.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.847
You know, it was kind of
fun having an egg hunt.

20:18.517 --> 20:21.852
Maybe we should paint eggs
and hide 'em every year!

20:21.854 --> 20:23.888
Hey, you know what?
You're awesome with eggs.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.456
Now, what do you think of this?

20:25.458 --> 20:26.991
The Easter...

20:26.993 --> 20:28.392
Bunny!

20:28.394 --> 20:30.528
You mean like a job?

20:30.530 --> 20:32.430
Would I have to
wear a stiff suit?

20:32.432 --> 20:34.665
No, your birthday
suit is perfect.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.669
Mom, I got a job!

20:40.439 --> 20:42.306
What do bunnies
have to do with Easter?

20:42.808 --> 20:45.476
Or eggs. Or painting.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.978
I'm sorry, that could
never catch on.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.512
Oh, I'm gonna
get business cards.

20:48.514 --> 20:49.981
I'm the Easter bunny!

21:04.429 --> 21:05.796
Perfect!

21:13.839 --> 21:16.440
The ship is terrible!
Not seaworthy!

21:16.442 --> 21:17.442
Bunny overboard!

24:59.965 --> 25:00.965
A-ha!

25:24.189 --> 25:25.890
Whoa, whoa.

25:28.561 --> 25:29.693
Oh. Ah!

25:42.774 --> 25:44.141
Oh.

27:25.910 --> 27:26.910
Oh!

27:52.337 --> 27:53.337
Oh, no!

28:58.203 --> 29:00.137
Hey, look, shooting stars.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.306
Oh, oh! Quick, quick,
make a wish, make a wish.

29:02.308 --> 29:05.242
You gotta make a wish.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.077
Wow, my wish came true.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.412
I'm okay!

29:10.348 --> 29:11.448
Mine too.

29:13.218 --> 29:15.052
<i>I think I burned
my marshmallows.</i>

30:24.823 --> 30:25.823
Aah!

40:05.569 --> 40:06.903
Over there!

41:41.699 --> 41:42.832
Oh!

42:31.815 --> 42:33.216
<i>Three, two, one...</i>

46:07.531 --> 46:09.265
Yee-haw!

46:12.336 --> 46:13.336
Aah!

46:56.881 --> 46:57.881
<i>Goal!</i>

47:02.352 --> 47:03.419
Ow!

49:38.308 --> 49:39.375
Ah!

50:11.541 --> 50:14.010
Welcome aboard, mate.

50:20.717 --> 50:23.152
Hey, this cruise
has entertainment.

50:23.154 --> 50:24.794
<i>Seriously? Sid,
you're out of your mind.</i>

50:49.312 --> 50:51.247
<i>They left without me.</i>

50:51.249 --> 50:54.717
Isn't there anyone who
cares about Sid the sloth?

51:03.627 --> 51:05.394
Get off my face.

51:07.197 --> 51:09.799
Whoa, you and me,
we make a great team.

51:09.801 --> 51:11.767
What do you say we just
head south together?

51:11.769 --> 51:14.070
Great, yeah. Hey, jump up on my
back and relax the whole way.

51:14.072 --> 51:15.638
Wow, really?
No.

51:15.640 --> 51:17.239
Didn't get the name.

51:17.241 --> 51:19.375
Manfred.
Manfred? Yuck.

51:19.377 --> 51:23.345
How about Manny the moody mammoth?
Or Manny the melancholy...

51:25.515 --> 51:28.084
<i>His daddy
wiped out half our pack</i>

51:28.086 --> 51:29.718
<i>and wears our skin to keep warm.</i>

51:30.554 --> 51:32.421
<i>An eye for an eye.</i>

51:32.423 --> 51:36.358
And, Diego,
bring me that baby alive.

51:41.665 --> 51:43.365
Go! Go!

52:07.691 --> 52:09.592
<i>That's his herd
right up the hill.</i>

52:09.594 --> 52:10.594
<i>We should return him.</i>

52:12.295 --> 52:13.395
Manny!

52:29.379 --> 52:30.913
Name's Diego, friend.

52:30.915 --> 52:33.315
Manfred, and I'm
not your friend.

52:33.317 --> 52:34.817
If you're looking for the humans,
you're wasting your time.

52:34.819 --> 52:36.152
They left this morning.

52:36.154 --> 52:37.686
They couldn't be far.

52:37.688 --> 52:39.855
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

52:39.857 --> 52:41.223
They headed north two hours ago.

53:01.511 --> 53:03.546
You could have died,
trying to save me.

53:04.414 --> 53:05.574
That's what you do in a herd.

53:06.850 --> 53:07.970
You look out for each other.

53:11.755 --> 53:14.890
Come on, Diego, let's
bring this mammoth down.

53:18.562 --> 53:19.895
What are you doing?

53:19.897 --> 53:22.631
Leave the mammoth alone.

53:36.413 --> 53:38.847
You have to leave me here.

53:38.849 --> 53:41.617
If those humans get through the
pass, you'll never catch them.

53:52.829 --> 53:54.697
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

53:58.702 --> 54:00.803
Diego? You're okay!

54:00.805 --> 54:01.837
Nine lives, baby.

54:03.006 --> 54:05.908
This is gonna be
the best migration ever.

54:05.910 --> 54:08.191
I'm telling you, I'll show you
my favorite watering holes.

54:10.380 --> 54:12.548
<i>Everything is melting.</i>

54:12.550 --> 54:14.710
The dam's gonna break. The
entire valley's gonna flood.

54:15.685 --> 54:18.621
Look around.
You're in a bowl.

54:18.623 --> 54:21.390
Bowl's gonna fill up.
Ain't no way out.

54:21.392 --> 54:22.725
What are we gonna do?

54:22.727 --> 54:26.328
Unless you can make it
to the end of the valley.

54:26.330 --> 54:28.631
There's a boat.
It can save you.

54:39.276 --> 54:41.543
Well, shave me down
and call me a mole rat.

54:41.545 --> 54:43.879
You found another mammoth.

54:43.881 --> 54:46.682
Where? Wait a minute. I thought
mammoths were extinct.

54:49.519 --> 54:51.053
This guy giving
you trouble, sis?

54:51.055 --> 54:52.721
Sis?

54:52.723 --> 54:55.024
That's right.
These are my brothers.

54:55.026 --> 54:57.993
I don't think her tree goes all
the way to the top branch.

54:57.995 --> 55:00.429
Hey, she should come with us.

55:00.431 --> 55:02.564
Are you insane? No way.

55:02.832 --> 55:05.301
Okay.

55:05.303 --> 55:07.983
Manny wants me to ask you if you'd
like to escape the flood with us.

55:08.038 --> 55:10.673
No brakes. Gotta roll.
Meet you at the other end.

55:11.908 --> 55:15.077
So, you think she's
the girl for me?

55:15.079 --> 55:17.446
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at all.

55:19.449 --> 55:20.983
We made it.

55:20.985 --> 55:22.718
Yeah, we showed
those scary vultures.

55:28.992 --> 55:30.793
There's only one way to go.

55:30.795 --> 55:32.461
We go forward.
We go back.

55:32.463 --> 55:33.462
Forward.
Back.

55:33.464 --> 55:34.830
Come on.

55:34.832 --> 55:36.065
Fine.

55:51.381 --> 55:53.082
Manny.

55:53.084 --> 55:54.484
It's Ellie, she's
trapped in a cave.

56:44.167 --> 56:47.870
Ellie, I don't want us to be
together because we have to.

56:47.872 --> 56:50.406
I want us to be together
because we want to.

56:50.408 --> 56:51.907
And I wanna be with you, Ellie.

56:52.575 --> 56:53.976
What do you say?

56:53.978 --> 56:55.878
Oh, Manny, I thought
you were going...

56:57.914 --> 56:59.548
You're possum enough for me.

57:01.017 --> 57:02.618
The baby's coming!
The baby's coming!

57:02.620 --> 57:04.086
Watch it!
I'm having a baby!

57:06.689 --> 57:07.689
Manny?
Huh?

57:09.192 --> 57:11.493
I told you it was just a kick.

57:11.495 --> 57:14.563
Sorry, folks! False alarm!

57:14.565 --> 57:18.767
I'd like to present
Egbert, Shelly and Yoko.

57:18.769 --> 57:21.603
Sid, whatever you're
doing, it's a bad idea.

57:25.675 --> 57:26.775
Momma!

57:27.210 --> 57:28.710
I'm a mommy.

57:35.685 --> 57:36.852
Sid!
Sid!

57:38.188 --> 57:39.488
Help!

57:46.863 --> 57:47.896
Sid must be down there.

57:50.133 --> 57:52.835
We've been living
above an entire world,

57:52.837 --> 57:54.203
and we didn't even know it.

57:55.572 --> 57:57.940
The name's buck.
Short for buckminster.

57:59.108 --> 58:02.211
Long for "buh."

58:02.213 --> 58:04.146
What are you doing here?

58:04.148 --> 58:05.781
Our friend was taken
by a dinosaur.

58:05.783 --> 58:07.516
Well!

58:07.518 --> 58:09.518
He's dead.
Welcome to my world.

58:21.498 --> 58:23.665
Wait! Sloth down!

58:25.602 --> 58:29.571
It's not so bad down here. Nice
weather, friendly neighbors.

58:36.112 --> 58:37.746
Hi, neighbor.

58:40.984 --> 58:42.918
Rudy.
Rudy?

58:42.920 --> 58:44.119
Peaches!

58:45.088 --> 58:46.188
Peaches?

58:47.524 --> 58:50.225
Peaches! The baby!
What, now?

58:50.227 --> 58:52.027
This? Not good.

58:52.029 --> 58:53.029
Stranger danger!

59:00.270 --> 59:02.671
That's right! Come on!

59:02.673 --> 59:04.072
Yee-haw!

59:05.241 --> 59:08.577
This is the end
of Sid the sloth!

59:13.049 --> 59:14.283
Help!

59:14.285 --> 59:15.617
No, Sid! It's me!

59:15.619 --> 59:17.019
And me!
And me!

59:17.987 --> 59:19.221
I think we're getting close.

59:32.035 --> 59:33.735
She looks just like her mother.

59:33.737 --> 59:35.704
Thank goodness.

59:35.706 --> 59:37.806
It's good to have you back, Sid.

59:37.808 --> 59:40.108
Never thought I would say this,
but I missed you, buddy.

59:41.344 --> 59:43.679
All right, mammals,
let's get you home.

59:52.355 --> 59:55.223
That's right, sweetheart.
Welcome to the ice age.

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:09.838
What was that?

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:14.956
I think we're almost there!

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:24.386
I'll bury you all and
dance on your graves.

01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:26.188
So frail.

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:28.991
And she can't wait to
spend time with you, Sid.

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:37.633
Manny! No!

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:49.177
No matter how long
it takes, I will find you!

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:55.050
<i>That wall is going to
keep moving and crush us.</i>

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:56.885
We need to get to
the land bridge.

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:57.919
Any questions?

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:01.256
Yes?

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:05.127
When you drink water through your
trunk, does it taste like boogers?

01:01:05.129 --> 01:01:07.129
No.

01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:09.297
Well, sometimes. Let's move!

01:01:15.938 --> 01:01:19.041
Hmm. Am I hallucinating, or is that
ice coming straight towards us?

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:27.182
Captain Gutt, here to help.

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:29.718
You know, that's a nice monkey.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.687
Lights out, big fella.

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:41.830
Hey, buddy.
Welcome to the party.

01:01:41.832 --> 01:01:42.964
Prepare the plank!

01:01:42.966 --> 01:01:44.132
Prepare the plank!

01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:46.702
Preparing the plank!

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:49.678
Ain't going to happen, captain.

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:56.211
Does anyone have floaties?

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:02.918
There! Land!

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.387
Everyone paddle. Paddle!

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.892
Guys, over here.
Come on, it's a shortcut.

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:15.263
Wow! That is amazing.

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:16.265
Huh?

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:26.007
Guys, we should get out of here.

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:27.476
This is epic!

01:02:27.478 --> 01:02:29.010
Go! Go! Go!

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.821
Hey, peach, loosen up!
Have some fun.

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:41.923
Fun? I'm out of here.

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:45.894
If you geniuses are normal, this
species is going to end up extinct.

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:48.864
Yeah, well, your species is
going to be extinct first.

01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:51.199
Burn!

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:53.101
We're the same species, genius.

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:54.503
What? Double burn.

01:02:58.107 --> 01:02:59.808
Is that...?
Peaches? There she is!

01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:01.309
Dad!

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.217
Go, go, I'm right behind you.

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:10.485
No!

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:12.354
I'm right behind you.

01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:14.289
Dad!

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.491
No!

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:18.827
There's nowhere to run, Manny.

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:25.200
Sometimes, it pays
to weigh eleven tons!

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:26.868
No!

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:28.804
<i>Bon voyage,</i> monkey boy!

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:36.211
Did somebody hail a whale?

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:46.888
How's that for an entrance?

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:50.385
During moviemaking sometimes, you
find characters that really stand out

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:53.588
and become this happy
surprise in the story,

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:55.223
<i>and Scrat was one of them.</i>

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:57.459
<i>Scrat was one of the</i>

01:04:57.461 --> 01:04:59.427
<i>characters that we</i>
<i>developed for</i> ice age 1.

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:01.563
And it came from a need to find

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.899
an opening sequence
for the movie.

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:03.899
<i>So, we went through Peter's
drawings, and there it was.</i>

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:08.169
<i>We added the saber-teeth
and we gave him an acorn,</i>

01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:10.372
<i>and this whole issue was born.</i>

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:12.407
<i>And that's when the idea
of that glacier sequence</i>

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:14.209
<i>became the opening of the movie.</i>

01:05:14.211 --> 01:05:16.578
<i>Very simple storyline,
no dialogue.</i>

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.381
Just having this
little character

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:21.950
run for his life with one
thing in mind, the nut.

01:05:21.952 --> 01:05:23.351
<i>People just loved it.</i>

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:25.520
<i>Everybody who saw
this sequence just</i>

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:27.956
could so identify with
this poor little guy,

01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:30.558
that he just got
a life of his own,

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.261
and we just ended up using him
throughout all three movies.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:35.096
<i>Scrat sequences are
a dream, in a way,</i>

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:37.399
<i>because it is pure animation,</i>

01:05:37.401 --> 01:05:39.701
just to have fun
and do slapstick

01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:42.637
and not be tied
down by dialogue.

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:46.341
<i>But after three movies, it does
get challenging because...</i>

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:48.310
<i>"So, okay, what have we
not done with this guy?"</i>

01:05:51.548 --> 01:05:55.250
The most important thing in
Scrat's universe is his acorn.

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:58.253
<i>That's all he cares about.</i>

01:05:58.255 --> 01:06:01.189
<i>And writers came up
with something brilliant</i>

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:03.224
<i>by coming up with
the one thing that</i>

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:05.126
<i>could possibly
compete with that,</i>

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.162
<i>and that's Scratte.</i>

01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:12.233
Scratte is the perfect foil because
she's beautiful, she's cunning,

01:06:12.235 --> 01:06:14.669
<i>she's everything that he isn't.</i>

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:26.414
When I was designing Scratte, I knew
she had to be the opposite of Scrat.

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:28.483
<i>So she had to be beautiful.</i>

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.719
<i>She had to be smart. All
the things that he's not.</i>

01:06:30.721 --> 01:06:34.489
Scrat is this nervous,
twitchy character,

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.325
<i>not particularly
well-groomed.</i>

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:42.097
<i>She's elegant and smooth.</i>

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:44.265
<i>We just wanted her to look as
beautiful as she could be,</i>

01:06:44.267 --> 01:06:45.700
<i>because scrat has to look at her</i>

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:47.435
<i>and just fall in
love immediately.</i>

01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:50.638
So, we gave her long eyelashes
with a little bit of blue,

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.520
<i>so we just make her
really feminine and funny.</i>

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:01.082
Scratte did start out being
a lot more instinctual,

01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:04.119
and then we started
seeing her look,

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:06.421
<i>playing against scrat
actually worked a lot better.</i>

01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:08.543
<i>And that's where it started
to mold her personality.</i>

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:11.259
<i>Her movement is really different</i>

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:13.695
<i>because she's very
straight with her poses.</i>

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:15.697
<i>Scrat will pop and just
jerk into the motion.</i>

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.032
<i>She'll do a swirl.</i>

01:07:17.034 --> 01:07:21.503
<i>The uglier and the more disheveled
and pathetic you get Scrat,</i>

01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:23.571
the funnier he is.

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:26.408
But you always have to make sure
she's looking as good as possible,

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:28.890
<i>and that's where the comedy is,
the contrast between the two.</i>

01:07:30.814 --> 01:07:33.648
<i>And we kind of thought, what
if both Scrat and scratte</i>

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:36.284
<i>have the same goal, the nut.</i>

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:38.219
<i>Like, we can create
this great fun little</i>

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.488
kind of <i>spy vs spy</i> kind of thing

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:43.258
that they keep trying to outsmart
each other to catch the nut.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.493
<i>And then, therefore by doing
that, they find love.</i>

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.696
<i>Then, the concept came up,
the love triangle,</i>

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:51.566
<i>Scrat, nut and girl, Scratte.</i>

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:54.469
The Scrat sequences in
general are not scripted.

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:59.140
<i>They are all invented in
story and with the director.</i>

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:03.378
<i>Carlos definitely had the idea of
the Scrat arc, meeting the girl</i>

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:06.214
<i>and a basic idea of
what would happen.</i>

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:09.584
<i>But as far as every individual
sequence, they leave it to us.</i>

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:15.690
<i>The first thing we do
is a first rough pass.</i>

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:18.259
<i>Rough, dirty
awful looking drawings,</i>

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:19.627
<i>and then you pitch them
in front of the whole room.</i>

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:21.496
<i>You act it out.
You do voices.</i>

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:23.264
<i>You're really trying
to get the room to laugh.</i>

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.432
And then falls like a rock.

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:32.707
The Scrat tango sequence,
that was my assignment.

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:35.143
<i>And I thought, "well, okay. They
need to be fighting over the nut.</i>

01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:36.877
<i>"It's gotta be fun
and funny and..."</i>

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.446
<i>So, then, the next
part was me just trying</i>

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:40.115
<i>to sketch out the choreography,</i>

01:08:40.117 --> 01:08:42.117
<i>seeing how it would
work with their tails,</i>

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.586
<i>and bringing squirrelness
into a human dance.</i>

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:46.854
<i>Just weeks of just doing gags.</i>

01:08:46.857 --> 01:08:48.857
And then Carlos basically
just picks his favorite,

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:51.693
<i>and the tango was born.</i>

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.761
<i>The tango sequence took 33
days, about five weeks,</i>

01:08:54.764 --> 01:08:57.265
because there was a lot of play
between who is holding the nut,

01:08:57.267 --> 01:08:59.567
where it's going, so it takes
a great deal of Polish time.

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:02.403
<i>We looked up on YouTube
how to dance tango,</i>

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:04.139
<i>and I think one of
the coolest responses</i>

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.773
<i>was when the
storyboard artists noticed</i>

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:09.144
<i>I did a backwards ocho
in one of the shots I did.</i>

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.513
<i>So, actually, I have very
specific tango moves in this.</i>

01:09:11.515 --> 01:09:12.747
<i>So, it's all
a collaborative effort</i>

01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:14.616
that made that sequence
extremely painful

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:16.751
but extremely rewarding
at the same time.

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:18.720
<i>It's one of my favorite
sequences in the movie.</i>

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:21.689
It just shows how fun and
painful love can be.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.727
<i>One thing about the original
scrat was thinking,</i>

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:25.727
<i>"what's gonna be
the voice for Scrat?"</i>

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:29.363
<i>So, we just put temporary
voices just to see.</i>

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:30.698
<i>We needed some sounds.</i>

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.600
<i>So, I connected
with my inner Scrat,</i>

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:37.705
and the noises
just came voluntarily.

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:39.908
<i>Mostly, it's effort sounds.</i>

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:44.479
Scrat gets surprised by
something, it's kind of...

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:51.837
He's getting bopped on the head, it's
kind of the same sound, only just...

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:55.490
Things like that.

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:02.263
It matched so perfectly.

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:05.800
We said, "why look elsewhere?
We got the talent right here."

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:08.870
<i>And Chris became the signature
voice of Scrat and was wonderful.</i>

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:12.574
<i>And then when we
defined the Scrat girl,</i>

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:14.509
<i>I decided,
"let's look inside again.</i>

01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:16.811
<i>"Let's go through
the same process."</i>

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:20.949
<i>And Karen Disher, she'd been doing
a lot of voice temps for us.</i>

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:22.984
I've been doing scratch
voices since I started out.

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:25.653
<i>So, I think when
they needed a temp voice</i>

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:28.289
<i>for Scratte at
the beginning of production,</i>

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:29.924
<i>they were like,
"we'll just bring Karen in,"</i>

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:32.293
<i>which is, for me, a lot of fun,</i>

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:33.828
<i>when you can come into the
booth and they're like,</i>

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.230
"okay, you're falling
down a cliff."

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:37.999
You know, "you're being
punched in the stomach."

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:41.002
You know, it's a funny
and weird thing.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.008
<i>In terms of vocalizing, it's
tricky because Scrat's so great.</i>

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:49.844
<i>Chris wedge does
such an amazing voice.</i>

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:53.348
So, how do I keep this
animal in the same family,

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.348
<i>but different at the same time?</i>

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:59.454
<i>So, for me, that was thinking
of little sexy things like,</i>

01:10:59.456 --> 01:11:02.790
little purrs she could do,
little come-hither squeaks,

01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:04.859
which is difficult to do.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:11.733
<i>There's big, furry paws
to fill in a lot of ways.</i>

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:14.269
Pretty clever. I don't
know where she gets it.

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:17.405
I just don't.

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:21.643
<i>I was not expecting to end up being
the voice in a movie at all.</i>

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:24.879
<i>And then John came to me about a
year and a half ago now and said,</i>

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:27.348
<i>"guess what?
You're gonna be Scratte."</i>

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:28.983
And I was just,
like, "shut up."

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:30.505
Like, I couldn't
even believe it, so...

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.054
<i>It was really exciting.</i>

01:11:33.056 --> 01:11:34.956
Mmm!

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:37.825
The final ending where you kind
of, you keep the question,

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:40.328
"is he gonna be with the girl?
Or is he gonna get the nut?

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:40.328
<i>"Or he's gonna get nothing?"</i>

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:44.599
<i>And we had, like, three different
ways of ending the movie.</i>

01:11:44.601 --> 01:11:46.882
<i>And we chose one that we thought
was the best for Scrat.</i>

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:52.440
The nut always comes first for Scrat.
Always, always, always.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:55.410
<i>He can't win at the end, never.</i>

01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:57.572
<i>And that's the cardinal rule
'cause that's the Scrat.</i>

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:02.850
We kind of leave Scrat where we
pick him up in the beginning.

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:05.453
<i>He's always gonna have a certain
amount of struggle in his life</i>

01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:06.821
<i>no matter what happens.</i>
