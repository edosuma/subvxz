25:25.859 --> 25:26.860
Why not?

25:26.944 --> 25:28.195
You've seen what he can do.

25:28.278 --> 25:31.073
His attachment to you
makes him vulnerable to his fears.

25:32.449 --> 25:33.450
His anger.

25:33.534 --> 25:35.035
All the more reason to train him.

25:35.118 --> 25:36.161
No.

25:38.247 --> 25:41.416
I've seen what such feelings can do
to a fully trained Jedi Knight.

To the best of us.

25:48.549 --> 25:50.676
I will not start this child
down that path.

25:52.135 --> 25:53.929
Better to let his abilities fade.

two HK-87 assassin droids,
and a hired gunfighter.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.136
He reads ex-military to me.

26:35.053 --> 26:37.181
Combined, not even your laser swords

26:37.264 --> 26:39.975
would be able to protect you

During the Clone Wars,

27:03.332 --> 27:06.126
She survived

27:06.210 --> 27:08.378

strung up just outside the inner gate.
