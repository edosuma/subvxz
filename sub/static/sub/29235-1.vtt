JAY: <i>The Oxford
American Dictionary</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:24.157
<i>defines "dark"
as the absence of light,</i>

00:24.158 --> 00:26.592
<i>gloomy, cheerless.</i>

00:27.795 --> 00:32.198
<i>That's why I despise the night
and loathe sleep.</i>

00:32.198 --> 00:35.267
<i>But no matter how cold
and dark my cell is,</i>

00:36.637 --> 00:39.605
<i>I know it can protect me
from my living nightmare.</i>

JAY: <i>When the cold case lawyer
came into my life,</i>

01:14.108 --> 01:16.308
<i>a tiny sliver of light entered.</i>

01:17.445 --> 01:19.479
<i>But being locked up
made me afraid to hope.</i>

01:19.480 --> 01:22.682
[buzzer]

01:22.683 --> 01:25.484
JAY: <i>I was as stiff as a board
talking to her.</i>

01:29.590 --> 01:30.873
Hi.

01:30.874 --> 01:32.434
KAREN: I'm your new lawyer,
Karen Haley.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.628
I don't know
if you've heard of me,

01:35.629 --> 01:38.765
but I've done pretty well
with cold cases.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.733
So let's get to work.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.735
In your own words,
tell me exactly what happened.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.273
I'll tell you,
but you're not gonna believe me.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.142
Try me.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.213
It's like a bad B horror movie.

01:53.214 --> 01:56.850
That's why my attorney
wouldn't use it in my trial.

01:56.851 --> 01:59.519
That's okay.
Don't worry about what I think.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.589
Just tell me the events
as clearly as you can.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.892
JAY: <i>We were
on this trip to see</i>

02:05.893 --> 02:09.162
<i>where they made</i>
The Mangrove Slasher,

02:09.163 --> 02:12.132
<i>which is some dumb movie
we all watched.</i>

02:12.133 --> 02:14.334
<i>They say it really happened.</i>

02:14.335 --> 02:16.802
<i>Personally,
I don't believe in that stuff.</i>

02:20.341 --> 02:21.740
Who were we?

02:23.777 --> 02:25.911
It was my five friends
and Veronica's cousin.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.515
- Is Casey Veronica's cousin?
- Yeah.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.851
And who were your other friends?

02:33.521 --> 02:35.388
Veronica,

02:35.389 --> 02:37.390
Scott,

02:37.391 --> 02:38.892
Donny,

02:38.893 --> 02:40.426
Kate,

02:40.427 --> 02:42.529
Trevor, and me.

[mysterious music playing]

02:57.444 --> 03:01.547
[rock music playing]

03:01.949 --> 03:02.949
Hey, Kate.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.084
Yeah, babe.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.586
Jay's sleeping pretty sound
in back right now.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.387
So?

03:08.388 --> 03:10.190
So I'm feeling pretty warm
and fuzzy, what do you think?

03:10.191 --> 03:12.358
I'm not gonna climb
on top of you.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.261
I'm not asking you
to climb on top of me.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.296
You can use those talented hands
of yours, come on.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.782
Okay.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.634
But you have to promise
to be quiet.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.402
TREVOR: Shh.
All right, let's do it.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.271
[zipper goes down]

03:34.315 --> 03:38.850
[whirring]

03:43.357 --> 03:47.426
So, uh, guys, I met this
Egyptian chick the other night.

03:48.495 --> 03:49.762
Yeah, we were gonna get it on,

03:49.763 --> 03:51.564
but she was on her pyramid.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.832
[Donny laughs]

03:52.833 --> 03:54.601
So I did her mummy instead.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.436
[laughs]

03:56.437 --> 03:57.971
- Get it, babe?
- DONNY: Mummy.

03:57.972 --> 03:59.572
- SCOTT: Mummy instead?
- DONNY: Mummy. Ooh.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.640
[laughs]

04:00.641 --> 04:02.475
No.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.776
We all know you're not
gonna make it as a comedian.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.548
Why do you always have to say
things like that to me?

04:08.549 --> 04:10.483
VERONICA: Like what, Scott?

04:10.484 --> 04:12.418
You're always trying
to bring me down.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.886
You know I'm so passionate
about my comedy!

04:16.656 --> 04:19.993
You know, babe.
I would never fuck a comedian.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.793
But a businessman,

04:21.795 --> 04:25.564
I would do
dirty, dirty things to him.

04:28.335 --> 04:30.536
[rock music playing]

04:30.537 --> 04:33.806
[Trevor moans]

04:33.807 --> 04:35.675
Hey...

04:35.676 --> 04:39.344
I think Kate's giving Trevor
a hand job.

04:40.981 --> 04:44.884
No, no, I, I think she's
really giving him a hand job.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.653
TREVOR: Yeah, do that.
Yeah. Yeah.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.687
KATE: He's gonna hear you.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.055
TREVOR:
He's not hearing anything.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.990
Look,
he has a smile on his face.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.717
JAY: Ah, dude!

05:01.718 --> 05:03.758
DONNY: Wait, I think they're
both getting hand jobs!

05:06.407 --> 05:08.073
What do you think, Casey?

05:09.343 --> 05:10.826
No.

05:10.827 --> 05:12.312
Aah! Watch where you throw
your cigarettes.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.347
Burnt the tip of my dick,
you dick.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.316
Oh, shit. It stings.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.818
Oh, my God,
it looks like a red Popsicle.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.719
[Kate and Trevor laugh]

05:26.493 --> 05:30.796
[video game music playing]

05:33.400 --> 05:35.334
BOTH:
Turn that thing off, Donny!

05:38.472 --> 05:39.971
[music stops]

05:44.712 --> 05:48.547
[grunts]

05:51.852 --> 05:53.719
Hey, hey, you wanna try?

05:55.489 --> 05:56.655
[Donny moans]

05:57.558 --> 05:58.724
Okay, okay.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.666
Great Scott!

06:06.667 --> 06:09.135
That was a DeLorean.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.436
Wonder how fast it was going.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.815
Hey, do you think the car's
all right parked back there?

06:22.816 --> 06:24.016
It said tow away zone.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.119
Dude, look around.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.522
There's no one here for miles.
I think we're all right.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.990
TRAVIS: How the hell
did you find out

06:30.991 --> 06:31.924
about this place anyways?

06:31.925 --> 06:33.475
SCOTT: That wasn't me, dude.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.027
That was all Donny.
You know how he works.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.496
[Travis scoffs] Figures, man.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.663
KATE: Sounds pretty cool.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.165
Where's Veronica?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.099
She stayed in the car.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.701
She's putting on more makeup.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.970
And she hates nature,

06:43.971 --> 06:46.939
and I quote,
"hates old settler homes."

06:46.940 --> 06:49.075
Of course.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.010
Where's the bathroom? Uh...

06:51.011 --> 06:52.111
I'll help you find it.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.445
CASEY: Yeah?

06:53.446 --> 06:54.781
Good luck with that one,
you guys.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.883
Why are you so quiet
back there, Jay?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.484
'Cause his pussy hurts.

06:58.485 --> 06:59.685
Don't be so harsh.

06:59.686 --> 07:00.887
JAY: Dude, I heard you, man.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.422
Well, seriously, man.

07:02.423 --> 07:03.923
You're bringing
the whole group down.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.825
Will you please
lighten up a little bit?

07:05.826 --> 07:08.093
So, what's up with Jay?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.931
What do you mean?

07:11.932 --> 07:16.068
Well, does he, like,

07:16.069 --> 07:17.904
you know, have a...

07:17.905 --> 07:19.939
SCOTT: A girlfriend?
It's okay, you can ask.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.940
[laughs]

07:21.909 --> 07:23.108
Yeah.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.045
Uh, no.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.947
But it's funny
that you mention that.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.948
Dude, seriously?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.951
How am I supposed to forget
about her in three weeks?

07:31.952 --> 07:33.853
Plus, we used to go
on all this shit, man.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.022
We used to go on nature hikes
and all this, man.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.957
So, what happened?

07:37.958 --> 07:40.960
Well, um, as you can see,

07:40.961 --> 07:42.321
all of us guys,
we're really tight.

07:43.163 --> 07:46.499
Oh, that's so gay.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.568
SCOTT: Yeah.
We're like a hot boy band.

07:48.569 --> 07:49.869
[laughs]

07:49.870 --> 07:51.804
Well, we were, at least.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.074
Until our backstabbing friend
Steve

07:55.075 --> 07:58.511
decided to, you know, sleep
with Jay's girlfriend

07:58.512 --> 08:01.481
and broke up our entire group,
essentially.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.915
Scumbag Steve.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.232
JAY: He's a fucking asshole,
man.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.551
TREVOR: That's where her mind's
at, though.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.486
You gotta realize that.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.788
Are you interested?

08:11.558 --> 08:12.592
Maybe.

08:12.593 --> 08:16.596
Ah, I'm making water.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.263
This is awesome!

08:20.868 --> 08:24.704
[retches]

08:24.705 --> 08:25.937
Ew.

08:27.808 --> 08:31.243
[retches]

08:32.044 --> 08:33.945
[steps come closer]

08:46.093 --> 08:49.161
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.997
Ooh, oh.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.134
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, boy?

08:55.135 --> 08:56.301
[Donny whimpers]

08:57.204 --> 08:59.237
I'm gonna blow
your goddamned head off.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.976
[Donny screams]

09:03.977 --> 09:04.844
What was that?

09:04.845 --> 09:06.044
What the hell was that?

09:06.045 --> 09:07.246
It sounded like Donny screaming.
Come on, come on.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.180
- Shit.
- Donny!

09:08.181 --> 09:10.782
[Donny screams]

09:14.688 --> 09:15.855
[Donny screams]

09:15.856 --> 09:16.856
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.257
Dude. God.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.860
Whoa, welcome
to the party, people.

09:20.861 --> 09:24.797
Damn city folks, think you can
come terrorize my village?

09:24.798 --> 09:27.967
Actually, a village
is a group of houses

09:27.968 --> 09:30.102
and associated buildings,
larger than a hamlet...

09:30.103 --> 09:31.647
TRAVIS:
Donny, cut it out, dude.

09:31.648 --> 09:33.192
...and smaller than a town
in a rural area.

09:33.193 --> 09:34.740
- Are you wisecracking me, boy?
- DONNY: No, no, no, no.

09:34.741 --> 09:35.774
I don't wanna die.

09:35.775 --> 09:36.809
TRAVIS: You don't wanna do
this, man.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.311
Oh, yes, I do.

09:38.312 --> 09:40.246
After I off
this little pipsqueak,

09:40.247 --> 09:42.148
well, I might just off
the rest of you.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.849
I'll get you, too,
don't you worry.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.151
[whimpering]

09:45.152 --> 09:46.952
SCOTT: Just take it easy, man.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.689
Ha!

09:50.690 --> 09:52.358
I knew I had y'all.
I should be on the damn TV.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.092
That wasn't funny.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.826
Yeah, man.
You could have killed someone.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.264
- What, this old thing?
- TRAVIS: Yeah.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.232
Ah, this thing
hasn't shot in years.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.635
Don't get your panties
all up in a wad.

10:02.636 --> 10:06.939
DONNY: You really had me going.
Can I go back to my friends now?

10:06.940 --> 10:08.741
- Here, have some jerky.
- Oh, thanks.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.176
SCOTT: Big old fake gun trick.

10:10.177 --> 10:13.145
Yeah, real good.
A little too good.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.679
Yeah, you got me.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.917
Well, I'm glad somebody
appreciates a good scare.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.152
What do you besides scare
the shit out of people here?

10:20.153 --> 10:21.253
TRAVIS: Yeah.

10:21.254 --> 10:25.657
MAN: I don't know. Not much.
It ain't like it used to be.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.829
<i>Believe it or not,
this place used to be</i>

10:29.830 --> 10:32.330
<i>the main attraction
off the main road.</i>

10:33.200 --> 10:35.066
<i>Till they built
that goddamn highway.</i>

10:36.203 --> 10:38.537
Where you guys heading, anyway?

10:38.538 --> 10:40.873
We're actually headed
to, um, Mangrove County

10:40.874 --> 10:44.010
where, uh,
the infamous Mangrove Slasher

10:44.011 --> 10:47.713
butchered, murdered a bunch
of teenagers very brutally.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.782
And, uh, but, you know,
we like that kind of stuff.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.717
So we're just stopping
roadside attractions,

10:51.718 --> 10:53.686
kind of like the one
you have right here.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.755
So you guys are sick fucks, huh?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.857
Man, you like that twisted guts
and gore shit, don't you?

10:57.858 --> 10:59.825
Yeah! Guts and gore.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.160
Hey, hey, I don't mean
to be rude,

11:01.161 --> 11:02.828
but we're already
behind schedule.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.897
And we gotta get all the way
down to old country road

11:04.898 --> 11:06.132
to get there,
so if you don't mind...

11:06.133 --> 11:08.701
Well, a little word of advice.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.235
I'd stick to the highway.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.140
Wait.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.107
Why do you say that?

11:15.108 --> 11:17.175
Hmm, I don't know.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.245
Heard stories about
the old country road, you know.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.213
People not making it out alive.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.114
[Jay scoffs]

11:22.115 --> 11:23.882
Yeah, sure, man.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.022
Thanks for not killing me.
And the jerky.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.389
Sure, kid.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.429
These people
are in for a real show.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.829
TRAVIS: That was crazy.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.332

11:42.335 --> 11:45.437

11:56.850 --> 11:57.916
[whimpering]

12:21.441 --> 12:23.842
[laughs]

12:29.916 --> 12:31.850
[deep voice] Going somewhere?

12:33.453 --> 12:36.321
[laughing]

12:41.128 --> 12:45.130
[girl screams]

12:53.273 --> 12:54.439
[bell rings]

12:56.276 --> 12:59.912
I was hanging pretty tough
till the last hand.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.314
Thought I was
gonna get screwed again.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.250
I was holding a ten,
jack of diamonds,

13:04.251 --> 13:09.221
slot comes up, ace diamonds,
king diamonds, two of clubs.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.990
So here I am with a first draw
and a spade draw.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.027
Dumbass Ray raises the pot.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.363
I'm thinking he's got an ace,
king, you know.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.998
What the hell is
with this broke ass town?

13:25.172 --> 13:27.405
So, you going to
the tractor pull Friday night?

13:28.008 --> 13:29.842
Damn Skippy.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.277
[screams]

13:31.278 --> 13:32.978
- Dammit, Donny.
- [Donny laughs]

13:32.979 --> 13:34.913
TRAVIS: Cut it out, man.
That's not funny.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.250
Oh, that was funny.
Oh, you should have seen you.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.286
You were like, aah!
And I was like...

13:40.287 --> 13:43.289
You just scared the living
daylights outta him, didn't you?

13:43.290 --> 13:44.957
Yeah, I did.

13:44.958 --> 13:45.825
I did, I scared you.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.393
Yeah. Whatever, yeah.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.360
I got your number, Donny.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.498
Hey, man.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.167
The jokester over there
happened to lose our map.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.436
So, we're kind of lost
right now, and in a pickle.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.905
I don't know, do you have a map
back there we could check out,

13:59.906 --> 14:01.073
maybe give us some direction?

14:01.074 --> 14:02.608
Oh, yeah. Man, I got maps.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.210
- No problem.
- Thank God.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.511
Let me help you out here, buddy.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.011
See, Donny? He's got us.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.453
Right now...

14:22.629 --> 14:23.896
DONNY: What?

14:23.897 --> 14:25.631
That's, like, nothing.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.265
Yup.

14:30.136 --> 14:33.005
- Hi, there.
- Oh, hi.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.773
Candy.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.542
Well, I only... I only got four.
But you can have some.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.509
Oh, no.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.444
I'm Candy.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.545
Oh.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.914
Oh, I'm... I'm... I'm Donny.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.350
We're going
to, uh, Mangrove County.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.985
What's in Mangrove County?

14:45.986 --> 14:47.152
Mangrove County?

14:47.153 --> 14:48.553
All right. It's right here.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.889
Wait, wait, wait. There?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.258
DONNY: That's where these kids,

14:52.259 --> 14:55.261
they were partying,
like, they were by the beach.

14:55.262 --> 14:59.398
And this big, scary guy,
he was huge.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.567
And he came...
He came and chased them.

15:01.568 --> 15:02.935
And he had...

15:02.936 --> 15:05.337
He had two, um, you know, um-

15:05.338 --> 15:06.505
Those two machetes.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.973
Yeah, yeah. Machetes.

15:07.974 --> 15:10.910
And he's chasing them,
and he catches them.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.178
And he starts, cuts them open

15:13.179 --> 15:15.347
and chops
this one girl's head off.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.550
It was down by the mangroves,
that's where we're going.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.419
Well,
it's getting kind of late out.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.487
Do you have a place to stay?

15:21.488 --> 15:25.591
Well, actually,
we're kind of lost right now.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.993
Well, if you wanted to,
you could stay with me

15:27.994 --> 15:29.428
at the motel up the road.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.029
- Oh.
- Yeah.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.631
And there's a circus
right across the street.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.166
No way. There's a circus?

15:34.167 --> 15:37.068
[motorcycle motors running]

15:42.208 --> 15:44.509
[shouts]

15:49.316 --> 15:50.482
Hey! Guys, guys!

15:50.483 --> 15:52.151
[pants]

15:52.152 --> 15:54.253
There was a chick.
I was getting this candy.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.988
I was getting some W and W's.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.156
And she was all like,

15:57.157 --> 15:58.457
"Hey, there's a circus."

15:58.458 --> 16:00.359
And I was like,
"That's so cool."

16:00.360 --> 16:03.329
And then, she said there's
a hotel we can all stay at.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.597
And it's right down the road,
and we can hang out with her.

16:05.598 --> 16:06.698
Ooh.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.201
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

16:10.202 --> 16:11.136
- CANDY: Hey, everybody.
- DONNY: This is Candy.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.137
[Candy laughs]

16:14.107 --> 16:15.206
Hi, y'all.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.010
Holy shit.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.478
You asshole.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.045
[Candy laughs]

16:22.749 --> 16:26.251
Ooh, you didn't tell me
there were more cuties out here.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.152
Yummy.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.453
[laughs]

16:30.023 --> 16:31.190
Watch yourself.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.057
Oh, don't worry, honey.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.359
I was talking about you.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.659
[laughs]

16:35.295 --> 16:36.562
Ugh.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.430
No, thank you.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.233
DONNY: Tell them about
the circus and the motel.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.434
And all...
And all the other stuff.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.285
Oh, yes.

16:44.286 --> 16:46.138
Well, I'm a trapeze artist
at our family circus

16:46.139 --> 16:48.207
right down the road,
and right across the street

16:48.208 --> 16:50.442
is a motel you all
can stay at for the night.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.044
Would you like to come?
We'd love to have you.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.515
Dude, I'm game for that, man.
I'm beat.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.450
- Yeah.
- It's been a long day.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.452
What do you think, Scott?
You wanna go stay at the motel?

17:00.453 --> 17:01.453
I'm ready to go.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.067
[dog barks]

17:32.819 --> 17:38.323
So, this one time,
I had this dream

17:38.324 --> 17:40.526
that I just got married

17:40.527 --> 17:43.095
to this beautiful girl,
girl of my dreams.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.363
I mean, I was in a dream.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.433
And so, the night
of my honeymoon,

17:47.434 --> 17:51.203
I wake up, and I'm all tied up.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.072
And I'm still... I'm still...

17:53.073 --> 17:54.740
I'm still in my tux.

17:54.741 --> 17:58.177
And she's wearing her dress.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.579
Except she's got a big chainsaw.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.081
[laughs]

18:02.082 --> 18:06.251
And she starts saying
how much she loves me,

18:06.252 --> 18:07.319
and then starts cutting me.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.320
No, it's not funny.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.455
It was really scary.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.623
I can think of scary things.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.559
[laughs]

18:13.560 --> 18:15.861
You know, maybe someday
I'll make your dream come true.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.362
Oh, you're joking.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.764
You're joking with me.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.832
Oh, okay.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.422
Okay.

18:21.423 --> 18:23.012
I don't feel awkward anymore.

18:23.013 --> 18:24.603
That was kind of...
That was kind of weird, though.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.704
You're silly.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.205
[Candy laughs]

18:27.206 --> 18:28.707
What are you guys talking about?

18:28.708 --> 18:30.409
That's a horrible dream.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.611
Do you have to laugh that loud?

18:32.612 --> 18:33.745
Oh, honey.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.714
Money won't save you
here in the woods.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.815
You're in
a survival situation now.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.785
JAY: <i>I heard
from another inmate</i>

18:39.786 --> 18:41.386
<i>that they had gypsy circuses</i>

18:41.387 --> 18:44.656
<i>all over the south,
with no regard for life.</i>

18:44.657 --> 18:46.391
<i>They're all sick killers.</i>

18:46.392 --> 18:50.329
You damn gypsies!
This ain't no dog and pony show.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.498
You perform, or you die!

18:52.499 --> 18:55.601
Oh, wait till Mr. Kharver
hears about this.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.770
Hey, boss, boss, these
performers, they're useless.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.305
They just won't listen.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.840
Let me off one of them
right now.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.842
Come on, boss.
Please, boss. Let me off them.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.677
You goddamn fool.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.547
Don't you understand
what we're trying to do here?

19:08.548 --> 19:10.249
I mean, we are trying
to show the world

19:10.250 --> 19:12.317
the best goddamn circus
under the big top,

19:12.318 --> 19:14.219
and how the fuck do you think
I can do that

19:14.220 --> 19:16.188
if you go killing off
all our talent?

19:16.189 --> 19:17.922
You fat, lunkheaded fuck.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.692
[grunts]

19:22.529 --> 19:24.328
You lumpy loaf.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.634
[moans]

19:28.635 --> 19:31.303
Oh, no. Oh, please. Oh.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.670
Are you deaf?

19:34.307 --> 19:36.341
SKID: I told you, boss,

19:36.342 --> 19:38.377
I think he's one
of them retards or something.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.478
[laughs]

19:39.479 --> 19:40.711
Shut the fuck up.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.620
Oh, now you can talk, huh?

19:48.621 --> 19:50.438
[laughs]

19:50.439 --> 19:52.257
You know, I don't even know
what the fuck you're saying.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.793
But I see that you're not
so fucking deaf after all, huh?

19:54.794 --> 19:57.528
I think I'm gonna kill you
anyway, you motherfucker.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.566
Ah...

20:00.567 --> 20:02.668
[laughs]

20:02.669 --> 20:04.235
I got a better idea.

20:04.771 --> 20:11.210
[moans]

20:11.211 --> 20:12.743
[grunts]

20:13.713 --> 20:15.714
Did you know that ten percent

20:15.715 --> 20:16.949
of the human race
is left-handed?

20:16.950 --> 20:18.600
Hey, hey, Bo...

20:18.601 --> 20:20.251
Hey, I wasn't done
talking yet, Skid mark.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.754
You know I hate it
when you call me that, boss.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.923
It's just Skid, sir.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.360
I am so sorry.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.895
Skid scum.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.331
Guzzle ho, motherfucker,
bitch hog.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.332
[laughs]

20:33.333 --> 20:34.532
Is that a little better?

20:35.935 --> 20:36.968
Anyway...

20:38.438 --> 20:40.239
I am left-handed.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.608
And that means that I access
the right hemisphere

20:42.609 --> 20:45.611
of my brain,
which means I am creative.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.946
Hey, boss,
Einstein was left-handed.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.330
He's a genius.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.716
There you go,
I'm a motherfucking Einstein.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.584
Yes, you are.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.385
My cousin...

20:56.489 --> 20:57.656
...on the other hand,

20:57.657 --> 21:00.459
is a two-faced,
shifty, stupid bastard

21:00.460 --> 21:02.794
who hasn't had
a brand new thought in his mind

21:02.795 --> 21:05.329
in a thousand years.

21:06.633 --> 21:11.737
Now, what he doesn't know
is I am an entrepreneur.

21:11.738 --> 21:14.339
I've got the best acts.

21:14.340 --> 21:17.709
That's right, boss.
I got you the best in the world.

21:17.710 --> 21:18.710
You didn't get me shit.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.980
All you did was kidnap
the ones that I wanted,

21:21.981 --> 21:23.848
and I wanted
the best of the best.

21:25.351 --> 21:26.752
That's right, boss.

21:26.753 --> 21:27.918
It's your time to shine.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.758
[laughs]

21:32.759 --> 21:35.760
Right you are,
right you fucking are.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.997
And don't you forget it.

22:02.555 --> 22:05.457
- Is anyone even here?
- I don't know.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.492
Donny, you're probably gonna
have to pay for that, you know.

22:07.493 --> 22:08.793
I'll let them know.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.996
Man, this reminds me.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.967
Me and her stayed
at a hotel just like this.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.537
Seriously, you're
gonna get into that again?

22:18.538 --> 22:20.439
It's like the same
wooden top, too.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.574
Just lay go, all right? Please.

Donny, how do you have
this much energy?

22:41.127 --> 22:43.095
I can put you
in the presidential suite.

22:43.096 --> 22:45.130
Oh, whoa.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.315
Donny, you might wanna
get out from behind there.

22:47.316 --> 22:49.501
There's chicks in this room.
It's okay, don't worry.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.536
I'm just checking vacancies

22:51.537 --> 22:54.739

if I can save us some time.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.710
Oh, there's chicks in that room.

That side of the counter.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.130
You guys need a room?

23:18.131 --> 23:20.732
Uh, I guess two rooms, probably.

23:20.733 --> 23:21.733
Yeah, just, yeah.

- Do you want two rooms or three?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.117

- It's all right, dude.

23:39.118 --> 23:40.619

26:22.615 --> 26:23.814

You know how Scott's always
walking around

26:29.655 --> 26:30.322
Yeah.

26:30.323 --> 26:31.323

26:31.891 --> 26:33.307
I got a joke for him.

26:33.308 --> 26:34.726
I don't know if he'd appreciate
the punchline, though.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.161
- What?
- His girlfriend.

26:36.162 --> 26:39.164
- Ho.

26:50.876 --> 26:51.910
Yeah, screwing.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.745
Let's be honest.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.313
Scott has been
with some beautiful girls

26:55.314 --> 26:56.348
in his time, right?

26:56.349 --> 26:57.215
We both know that.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.183
Oh, yeah.

26:59.184 --> 27:01.152
So why the hell
does he put up with her shit?

27:01.153 --> 27:02.287
I don't know.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.155
Maybe it could be love.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.725

Way to get all sappy on me, man.
I don't think that's it.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.997
Well, she comes
from a wealthy family.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.366
She's a real rich bitch.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.000
I don't know, man.

27:16.001 --> 27:17.681
I don't think
Scott cares about that stuff.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.670
Yeah.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.306
Well, you know her dad's
supposed to get him that job.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.075
Oh, yeah. The job
I've heard so much about.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.778
Could you actually
picture Scott selling insurance?

27:26.779 --> 27:29.180
First of all,
they would make him shave.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.949
And then they'd probably dress
him up in this suit,

27:30.950 --> 27:32.466
with a matching tie.

27:32.467 --> 27:33.985
And he'd have some pens
sticking out of his pocket.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.271
Oh, man.

[applause]

33:10.589 --> 33:12.489
[people cheering]

33:33.178 --> 33:34.311
Me?

33:49.161 --> 33:50.328
[squeak]

33:50.329 --> 33:52.696
[people laugh]

33:54.533 --> 33:56.334
[people laugh]

33:56.335 --> 33:57.735
[screams]

33:57.736 --> 33:59.637
Just a little bit hungry.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.204
That kid just bit me, man.

34:02.107 --> 34:03.547
Come on,
let's get out of here, guys.

34:04.543 --> 34:07.645
God, dammit.

34:07.646 --> 34:12.250
[people laugh]

34:12.251 --> 34:13.516
Who needs you?

34:18.123 --> 34:21.324
Donny was obsessed
with this Candy girl.

34:21.326 --> 34:22.827
[sighs]

34:22.828 --> 34:25.563
She was a barefoot, inbred...

34:25.563 --> 34:28.498
redneck product
of a monkey fuck.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.467
But we all wanted
Donny to get laid.

34:32.704 --> 34:36.540
When Trevor got bit by some kid,
we all took off.

34:37.476 --> 34:41.244
I was glad,
'cause it was creepy.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.382
Then things got weird.

34:45.384 --> 34:47.717
Really fast.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.458
They're leaving?

34:55.761 --> 34:58.496
Ugh.
I do everything around here.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.364
Jesus, man,
what the hell was up with that?

35:00.365 --> 35:01.766
I say we just get
the hell out of here.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.434
CANDY: Guys, stop,
where you going?

35:03.435 --> 35:05.236
- Where are we going?
- What's wrong, yeah?

35:05.237 --> 35:07.305
What the heck's going on
with that circus back there?

35:07.306 --> 35:09.574
Oh, come on.
It's just their sense of humor.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.253
Don't be such a baby.

35:11.254 --> 35:12.932
Come on, we wanna invite you
to dinner

35:12.933 --> 35:14.612
as our special guests
just to make up for it. Yeah.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.780
- I don't know.
- Yeah, let's go.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.315
- No, you know what?
- I'm hungry.

35:17.316 --> 35:18.716
Come on, I'm making
something special for you.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.718
Yeah, I guess, but, I mean,
dinner and we're out...

35:20.719 --> 35:23.554
- Dine and dash.
- That works.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.189
TREVOR: All right, Donny.
We will stay.

35:25.190 --> 35:26.557
Oh, come on. I mean, wait.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.593
Wait, we can stay?

35:28.594 --> 35:30.862
Oh, dude, thanks.

35:30.863 --> 35:32.196
To complicate things,

35:32.197 --> 35:34.564
these escaped
petty armed robbers,

35:35.467 --> 35:37.734
<i>they were hitting,
uh, places near the circus.</i>

36:00.893 --> 36:01.859
Come on, Billy Boy.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.361
Time's a wasting.

36:03.362 --> 36:04.461
[scoffs]

36:07.299 --> 36:09.500
Ah, we should go
get some beers, man.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.335
No. We don't have enough time.

36:11.336 --> 36:12.570
We'll get that cash.

36:12.571 --> 36:15.673
We'll get that jacket you love.
Jesus.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.607
You do love that jacket.

36:18.911 --> 36:19.911
All right, all right.

36:24.383 --> 36:26.817
Oh, do you have to do
that right in front of me?

36:26.818 --> 36:28.486
What, is this scaring you?

36:28.487 --> 36:29.587
What, with that little thing?

36:29.588 --> 36:31.254
[scoffs] I don't think so.

36:39.932 --> 36:42.799
What do you mean,
hitting places near the circus?

36:44.436 --> 36:48.206
They held up a tow truck shop
and a gas station.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.573
<i>I think they were high on meth.</i>

36:51.543 --> 36:55.612
- Did you get that memo?
- I'm so sick and tired of...

37:00.485 --> 37:01.719
Yo, Moe.

37:01.720 --> 37:02.653
[neck cracks]

37:02.654 --> 37:03.888
What do you know?

37:03.889 --> 37:05.890
- [laughs]
- Yeah, that's right.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.691
I know you got the payroll.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.401
Nice tits, bitch.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.871
I'm not fooling around.
Where's the money, fatso?

37:20.872 --> 37:21.973
Fatso?

37:21.974 --> 37:23.541
Is that the best you've got,
you creep?

37:23.542 --> 37:24.909
Creep?

37:24.910 --> 37:26.444
Creep.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.545
[thud]

37:27.546 --> 37:29.614
Oh. What are you hitting me for?

37:29.615 --> 37:31.281
Money's in the drawer.

37:32.985 --> 37:34.351
BILLY BOY: Ugh.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.859
Yeah!

37:45.797 --> 37:46.864
[Scabs laughs]

37:46.865 --> 37:50.568
[muffled] Hey, that's my jacket.

37:50.569 --> 37:51.936
Thanks.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.938
[muffled] What the heck,
get off my fucking jacket.

38:06.518 --> 38:09.620
[sighs]

38:09.621 --> 38:10.720
Candy.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.657
Hmm, Candy.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.071

39:36.942 --> 39:40.076
Oh, man, not again.

39:40.879 --> 39:41.746

39:41.747 --> 39:43.012
Ew.

[door creaks]

40:02.801 --> 40:03.868
Hey, handsome.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.001
Nice hardware.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.471
You wanna hook up?

40:07.472 --> 40:08.839
[laughs]

40:08.840 --> 40:10.874
Yeah, I wanna hook up.

40:12.644 --> 40:14.512
So what kind of beers
you guys got here?

40:14.513 --> 40:17.515
Oh, man. We got the finest.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.015
Roadkill Beer.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.953
Hey, look at that.
They got Roadkill Beer.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.424
And Finger Lick 'ems, too.

40:26.425 --> 40:27.858
[Scabs laughs]

40:27.859 --> 40:28.893
[laughs]

40:28.894 --> 40:30.694
You know what else is funny?

40:30.695 --> 40:32.997
I just heard on the radio
about some folks that look

40:32.998 --> 40:36.166
just like y'all
out murdering and killing folks.

40:37.469 --> 40:38.836
[laughs]

40:38.837 --> 40:39.770
That's funny.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.440
[laughs]

40:42.441 --> 40:46.043
You think that gun's
gonna scare me, boy?

40:46.044 --> 40:47.578
This ain't the city.

40:47.579 --> 40:48.813
Look, old man,
we're not messing around here.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.614
Yeah, me neither.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.483
[inaudible]
just get him off of me!

40:52.484 --> 40:53.884
You think you freaks
can come in here

40:53.885 --> 40:55.886
and flash your guns
on me like that?

40:55.887 --> 40:57.020
You're wrong.

40:57.021 --> 40:58.155
BILLY BOY:
Get him off me, dammit.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.123
Oh.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.125
So much for hooking up.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.060
Well, the offer's still
on the table, baby.

41:03.061 --> 41:05.528
No! Here's the offer.

Yeah?

41:35.861 --> 41:38.028
Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay. Let me...

41:38.029 --> 41:39.230
Oh, I gotta go get my...

41:39.231 --> 41:40.531
I gotta go get my shirt.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.066

41:42.067 --> 41:43.733
Hold on.

41:56.047 --> 41:57.647
Candy?

41:59.951 --> 42:01.118
Candy?

42:01.119 --> 42:02.720
Oh, hey.

42:02.721 --> 42:04.154
There you are.

42:04.155 --> 42:05.189
Thought you got cold feet.

42:05.190 --> 42:08.092
Oh, oh, no. My feet are hot.

42:08.093 --> 42:11.028
Like, like, dirty hot.

42:11.029 --> 42:14.864
Like, sweaty hot.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.633
Come here.

42:18.236 --> 42:19.904
I've got a surprise for you.

42:19.905 --> 42:22.239
Oh, yeah? Surprise?

42:22.240 --> 42:24.842
Have you ever had
moonshine before?

42:24.843 --> 42:27.311
Wait, you want me
to drink your piss?

42:27.312 --> 42:31.115
- No. It's moonshine. Try it.
- Moonshine?

42:31.116 --> 42:34.018
Wait, won't this stuff
make me go blind?

42:34.019 --> 42:35.052
[scoffs]

42:35.053 --> 42:36.286
Give it here.

42:42.294 --> 42:43.827
[sighs]

42:43.828 --> 42:45.162
Now try it.

42:45.163 --> 42:46.564
You'll like it.

42:46.565 --> 42:48.565
All right.

42:53.872 --> 42:56.106
Ah, ah.

42:56.107 --> 42:58.008
CANDY: That's not
how you're supposed to drink it.

42:58.009 --> 43:00.843
It's, it's good.
It's good, though.

43:02.113 --> 43:04.147
You're so cute.

43:05.650 --> 43:07.952
You're beautiful, Candy.

43:07.953 --> 43:11.055
Donny, do you like me?

43:11.056 --> 43:13.223
- A lot.
- Yeah.

43:13.224 --> 43:15.192
Do you want me?

43:15.193 --> 43:17.027
Uh, yeah.

43:17.028 --> 43:19.763
Yeah.

43:19.764 --> 43:22.633
Why do you want me?

43:22.634 --> 43:24.768
'Cause you're...

43:24.769 --> 43:27.070
Look at you.
You're just... You're everything.

43:27.706 --> 43:28.739
Drink it.

43:28.740 --> 43:29.873
I think I had enough.

43:29.874 --> 43:31.491
This is kind of...

43:31.492 --> 43:33.652
[with foreign accent] No,
it will make you feel strong.

43:33.979 --> 43:36.647
[Donny, distorted]
What happened to your accent?

43:36.648 --> 43:37.948
Don't worry.

43:37.949 --> 43:42.119
[distorted] I'm feeling kind
of [inaudible].

Are you okay?

43:59.871 --> 44:01.237
Do you need to take a break?

44:02.374 --> 44:05.109
No. It's just hard
bringing this stuff up.

44:05.110 --> 44:08.712
I've been trying to forget it
for the last four years.

44:08.713 --> 44:10.380
KAREN: Are you okay
to continue?

44:11.282 --> 44:12.415
Yeah.

Hello?

44:32.237 --> 44:34.938
Oh, no. No, oh, no.

44:34.939 --> 44:36.372
What's that thing?

44:40.245 --> 44:42.179
Candy?

44:42.180 --> 44:44.181
What's going on?

44:44.182 --> 44:46.183
Why are you wearing
a wedding dress? Why am...

44:46.184 --> 44:48.568
Shh.

44:48.569 --> 44:50.954
Honey, I'm here to make
dreams come true, remember?

44:50.955 --> 44:52.056
No, no. No.

44:52.057 --> 44:53.057
This is how you wanted it.

44:53.058 --> 44:55.959
- No, no, no, no, God, no.
- Yes!

44:55.960 --> 44:59.763
[laughs]

44:59.764 --> 45:01.465
Where are you going?

45:01.466 --> 45:03.767
Where are you going?

Oh, no. No, don't, no, no.

into my office for a quickie?

46:35.393 --> 46:36.826
Ah.

pumpkin eater,

46:46.070 --> 46:48.172
his dick was only a centimeter.

46:48.173 --> 46:50.107
All the fighting,
killing, and blow,

didn't grow.

46:56.848 --> 46:59.149
Oh, Sargey, Sargey.

Why are you so glum?

47:00.585 --> 47:02.386
Oh, look,
I was only pulling your leg.

Hey, Sarge, how's it going?

47:07.058 --> 47:08.258
Hey, you're looking good, man.

47:08.259 --> 47:09.459
I hope I didn't hurt
your feelings.

47:09.460 --> 47:11.995
I am sorry.
You know me, old Mr. Kharver,

47:11.996 --> 47:14.097
sometimes I do speak
before I think.

47:14.098 --> 47:15.232
[laughs]

47:15.233 --> 47:17.034
You know,
you're quite the cut of a man.

47:17.035 --> 47:18.268
I really do appreciate that.

47:18.269 --> 47:19.335
In fact, you know what?

47:19.336 --> 47:20.404
I would have to say, you're a...

47:20.405 --> 47:22.105
You're a goddamn fashion plate.

47:22.106 --> 47:24.575
Look at you with your plaid,
and your...

47:24.576 --> 47:26.176
Oh, those are real buttons,
aren't they?

47:26.177 --> 47:27.544
And pockets. The whole thing.

47:27.545 --> 47:29.379
I gotta say,
and that denim, you know,

47:29.380 --> 47:31.615
unlike that stupid
son of a bitch motherfucker

47:31.616 --> 47:33.032
that you work for.

47:33.033 --> 47:34.451
You know,
that guy's got no imagination.

47:34.452 --> 47:35.953
He's got no fashion sense.

47:35.954 --> 47:37.354
In fact, Sarge, you know,
I gotta wonder,

47:37.355 --> 47:39.256
why the fuck do you work
for that asshole?

47:39.257 --> 47:41.090
[laughs]

47:41.091 --> 47:42.926
You know what? I'm the one you
should be working for, frankly.

47:42.927 --> 47:45.529
Because, you know,
I wasn't gonna tell you this,

47:45.530 --> 47:47.464
but I got a surprise for you,
Sarge.

47:47.465 --> 47:49.299
Right in the trunk.
You know why?

47:49.300 --> 47:52.002
Because I'm an entrepreneur.
I'm a visionary.

47:52.003 --> 47:54.104
And I've got
a real good sense of talent.

47:54.105 --> 47:56.440
So, I want you to come over here
and take a look at this.

47:56.441 --> 47:58.575
Come on, Sarge.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

47:58.576 --> 48:00.010
There they are.

48:00.011 --> 48:01.645
I tell you, Sarge,
they're the flying phenoms.

48:01.646 --> 48:03.480
They're the flying fallacies,
I mean.

48:03.481 --> 48:05.616
I don't give a bearded lady's
ball sack what you call it.

48:05.617 --> 48:08.518
The fact is,
they are under contract

48:08.519 --> 48:11.054
to Sir Duke Kharver.

48:11.055 --> 48:13.056
[Kharver laughs]

48:13.057 --> 48:14.958
SARGE: Fuck you.

48:14.959 --> 48:16.926
Hey, you son of a bitch.

48:17.328 --> 48:19.096
You're missing
a big opportunity, Sarge.

48:19.097 --> 48:20.163
But of course,
you wouldn't know that

48:20.164 --> 48:22.199
if it kissed you in the ass.

48:22.200 --> 48:24.167
You sucker.

48:24.168 --> 48:25.402
Ah, shit.

48:25.403 --> 48:27.137
[screams]

48:27.138 --> 48:29.506
Oh, fuck,
look what you made me do.

48:29.507 --> 48:31.308
You're gonna have
a hard time on the trapeze,

48:31.309 --> 48:32.609
missing that finger.

48:32.610 --> 48:35.378
Ah, son of a bitch.

48:36.681 --> 48:39.983
[both moan]

48:39.984 --> 48:41.985
- Yeah.
- Oh, baby, it's a marathon.

48:41.986 --> 48:42.653
I hate to admit it.

48:42.654 --> 48:45.288
[laughs]

48:46.257 --> 48:51.661
[Sarge laughs]

48:53.631 --> 48:55.365
WOMAN: Yes, oh.

48:55.366 --> 48:57.968
[Sarge moans]

48:57.969 --> 48:59.403
[both moan]

48:59.404 --> 49:00.938
WOMAN: Oh.

49:00.939 --> 49:03.019
Quit fucking around,
Daddy says it's time for dinner.

49:06.210 --> 49:07.611
[sniffs]

49:07.612 --> 49:09.545
[grunts]

49:10.148 --> 49:15.952
[somber music playing]

49:18.156 --> 49:20.390
JAY: <i>When we entered
the train car,</i>

49:20.391 --> 49:23.693
<i>there was something
unnerving about it all.</i>

49:30.435 --> 49:31.535
VERONICA:
Is Donny here already?

49:31.536 --> 49:33.070
JAY: Donny's
gonna meet us later.

49:33.071 --> 49:34.371
He's with Candy.

49:34.372 --> 49:36.105
VERONICA: Ooh.

49:52.523 --> 49:57.026
Oh, we've been expecting you.
Please sit and enjoy.

50:00.098 --> 50:03.532
Allow me to introduce you
to my associates.

50:04.335 --> 50:06.136
Sergeant Psycho.

50:06.137 --> 50:08.738
You could say he does
not play well with others.

50:11.743 --> 50:15.044
[grunts]

50:19.751 --> 50:21.117
[sighs]

50:23.254 --> 50:26.156
And to my left,
this is Bellevue Bob.

50:26.157 --> 50:27.357
[laughs]

50:27.358 --> 50:29.626
- He's a real people person.
- [squeaks]

50:29.627 --> 50:31.160

50:37.435 --> 50:41.071

50:41.072 --> 50:42.772
[sucks]

50:49.113 --> 50:52.581
I am not eating this.
It's disgusting.

51:00.224 --> 51:02.826
So, uh,
what kind of clown are you?

51:02.827 --> 51:05.562
[farts]

51:05.563 --> 51:07.831
Ugh, gross, dude.

51:07.832 --> 51:10.267

[blows]

51:16.274 --> 51:18.707
[burble]

51:30.388 --> 51:31.721
Excuse me.
Where's the ladies' room?

51:31.722 --> 51:33.556
- Well, that's easy.
- Shut it!

51:35.760 --> 51:38.462
If you exit the train car,
you go into the warehouse

51:38.463 --> 51:39.595
and you'll find it.

51:47.638 --> 51:48.737
What?

51:56.447 --> 51:59.315
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

52:11.863 --> 52:15.231
[breathing]

52:39.490 --> 52:40.390
[flies buzz]

52:40.391 --> 52:45.361
[Casey coughs]

52:50.902 --> 52:53.302
Man, Casey's been gone a while.

52:56.941 --> 52:59.175
I think I'm gonna go
check on Casey.

53:15.459 --> 53:16.860
I'm not feeling well.

53:16.861 --> 53:18.528
Thank you, thank you.

53:18.529 --> 53:19.562
Babe?

53:20.898 --> 53:22.532
Babe.

53:22.533 --> 53:24.400
What? Why did she just run away?

53:25.469 --> 53:27.419
Well, that was quite rude.

53:27.420 --> 53:29.372
Slit that bitch's throat
and boyfriend pissed his pants.

53:29.373 --> 53:31.741
[both laugh]

53:31.742 --> 53:33.476
BOSS: Hey, look
at that window over there.

53:33.477 --> 53:35.345
That's a place we could stay.

53:35.346 --> 53:37.781
BILLY BOY: Oh, pull over.
Pull over.

53:37.782 --> 53:40.549
Hey, we may be able
to stay here for the night.

53:44.822 --> 53:45.755
[door creaks]

53:45.756 --> 53:48.258
[girl hums]

53:48.259 --> 53:49.993
What are you doing in here?

53:49.994 --> 53:51.460
I'm playing.

53:51.862 --> 53:53.363
Where's your mom and dad?

53:53.364 --> 53:54.530
They're right here.

53:55.499 --> 53:56.967
Why don't you come with me?

53:56.968 --> 53:58.634
And I'll help you
find your mom and dad.

53:59.637 --> 54:02.472
So you're not alone. Come on.

54:02.473 --> 54:03.807
I'm not alone.

54:03.808 --> 54:07.344
[laughs]

54:07.345 --> 54:08.645
[Casey screams]

54:08.646 --> 54:09.979
[laughter]

54:10.815 --> 54:11.948
Hey, Daddy.

54:11.949 --> 54:13.250
Why, hello, dear.

54:13.251 --> 54:15.385
I made you
something very special.

54:15.386 --> 54:17.653
Ah, a nice treat
from my lovely daughter.

54:20.992 --> 54:22.525
[screams]

54:22.526 --> 54:23.827

54:23.828 --> 54:24.761
KATE: Oh, my God!

54:24.762 --> 54:28.597
[clowns laugh]

54:35.873 --> 54:37.040
SCOTT: Baby,
you just gotta calm down.

54:37.041 --> 54:38.775
VERONICA: Scott,
I'm not gonna calm down.

54:38.776 --> 54:40.677
Seriously,
will you just listen to me?

54:40.678 --> 54:42.745
I'm trying,
but you won't stop yelling.

54:42.746 --> 54:44.814
No, you're not listening to me.
There's an eyeball in my soup.

54:44.815 --> 54:46.650
- Just give me your key.
- VERONICA: I don't have my key.

54:46.651 --> 54:47.628
SCOTT: Why don't you
have your key?

54:47.629 --> 54:48.606
VERONICA: Because I don't
have my key.

54:48.607 --> 54:49.586
VERONICA: You're supposed
to carry my stuff.

54:49.587 --> 54:50.753
Shh.

54:54.458 --> 54:55.625
This is all class.

54:55.626 --> 54:57.459
Too bad it's all low class.

54:57.862 --> 55:00.330
- You're screaming. Geez.
- Because...

55:00.331 --> 55:02.799
SCOTT: Just give me your key.
That's all I want is your key.

55:02.800 --> 55:05.302
Hey, guys. Having some problems?

55:05.303 --> 55:07.370
- Can you help us, please?
- Sure.

55:07.371 --> 55:08.871
- There's...
- What's wrong?

55:08.872 --> 55:10.373
- There's these crazy people.
- Babe, just relax...

55:10.374 --> 55:12.742
Stop telling me
to calm down, Scott.

55:12.743 --> 55:15.445
There was a circus
a little ways up the road.

55:15.446 --> 55:16.801
Can you help us, please?

55:16.802 --> 55:18.157
She says there's
an eyeball in her soup.

55:18.158 --> 55:19.516
- There was an eyeball...
- I think she's overreacting.

55:19.517 --> 55:20.650
Do you have
a phone we could use?

55:20.651 --> 55:22.352
- Sure.
- Please.

55:22.353 --> 55:23.553
You know what?
Come on to my room,

55:23.554 --> 55:25.488
and, uh, you can tell me all
about it.

55:25.489 --> 55:26.822
Thank you so much.

55:27.758 --> 55:29.358
Company.

55:35.900 --> 55:36.716
What?

55:36.717 --> 55:37.534
- Scott...
- I think we're just gonna leave.

55:37.535 --> 55:39.568
- I think we have the wrong room.
- I think not.

55:39.970 --> 55:43.505
There were these people
living in this dark warehouse.

55:44.542 --> 55:45.674
JAY: <i>I couldn't see them.</i>

55:46.644 --> 55:48.610
<i>But I could feel them.</i>

55:53.751 --> 55:55.652
One of them grabbed Casey.

55:55.653 --> 55:58.588
She got away, but they...
They scratched her up.

55:58.589 --> 55:59.888
[whimpers]

56:01.559 --> 56:02.425

56:05.996 --> 56:07.596
Casey, what happened?

56:09.633 --> 56:10.867
I can't tell...

56:10.868 --> 56:12.635
[mumbles]

56:12.636 --> 56:14.253
What are you talking about?

56:14.254 --> 56:15.872
We need to get out of here
right now.

56:15.873 --> 56:18.742
- You're bleeding.
- We need to get out of here.

56:18.743 --> 56:20.877
- What are you talking about?
- They...

56:20.878 --> 56:22.412
They attacked me.
We need to get out.

56:22.413 --> 56:24.447
- You're not making any sense.
- We need to go.

56:24.448 --> 56:26.015
We need to go. We need to go!

56:26.016 --> 56:27.884
[growl]

56:27.885 --> 56:29.386
See?

56:29.387 --> 56:30.653
I told you.

56:30.654 --> 56:31.821
It's coming.

56:31.822 --> 56:32.689
[growl]

56:32.690 --> 56:33.889
Come on.

56:56.046 --> 56:57.413
Shit.

56:57.948 --> 57:00.450
[pants]

57:00.451 --> 57:01.784
It's fucking locked.

57:05.156 --> 57:06.655
I guess it's door number two.

57:08.893 --> 57:10.559
What the hell? It's a dead end.

57:13.197 --> 57:14.380
The door's locked.

57:14.381 --> 57:15.565
What do you mean
the door's locked?

57:15.566 --> 57:17.066
I mean, I can't open it.

57:17.067 --> 57:18.734
- Jay, open it.
- I'm trying!

Calm down, okay?

58:04.715 --> 58:06.015
Just calm down.

58:06.016 --> 58:07.884
Just look at me. Look at me.

58:07.885 --> 58:10.053
Just calm down.
We'll find help, all right?

58:10.054 --> 58:11.403
We'll find help.

58:11.404 --> 58:12.755
We're gonna
take care of it, okay?

58:12.756 --> 58:14.524
We're gonna take care of it.

58:14.525 --> 58:15.558
Just calm down.

58:15.559 --> 58:16.859
Let's find a phone.

58:16.860 --> 58:18.161
Let's get help and get
the fuck out of here, okay?

58:18.162 --> 58:19.863
KATE: Okay.

58:19.864 --> 58:20.930
- You have to help us, man.
- Please.

58:20.931 --> 58:21.865
- Do you have a phone?
- Sure.

58:21.866 --> 58:24.183
BILLY BOY:
I'm gonna call you Legs.

58:24.184 --> 58:26.504
- Just get your hands off her.
- Hey, hey, don't be a hero.

58:29.240 --> 58:31.273
- Oh, thank God.
- Jesus.

58:31.976 --> 58:34.010
Hey, guys. Welcome to the party.

58:35.546 --> 58:37.096
Scott!

58:37.097 --> 58:38.647
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

58:41.785 --> 58:44.620

58:57.902 --> 59:00.203
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

59:00.204 --> 59:02.771
I don't know, but we
gotta get out of here soon.

59:03.674 --> 59:04.773
Let's go.

[Jay moans]

59:08.012 --> 59:10.313
- CASEY: Are you okay?
- JAY: Uh, yeah.

59:10.314 --> 59:11.681
Let's go that way.

59:11.682 --> 59:14.183
I think there's
an opening up here.

59:14.184 --> 59:16.285
Just go through it.

59:22.860 --> 59:24.626
- CASEY: Come on.
- JAY: Let's go.

59:27.164 --> 59:28.998
We need to figure out
a way out of here.

59:28.999 --> 59:30.332
Someone's messing with us.

59:31.769 --> 59:33.136
There's gotta be
a way out of here.

59:33.137 --> 59:34.103
- CASEY: I don't think so.
- [growl]

59:34.104 --> 59:35.772

I'll call for backup.

back to the circus,</i>

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:27.609

About two feet apart.

01:12:36.619 --> 01:12:38.721
We were facing each other.

With a chainsaw.

01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:41.789
They chopped her up.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.992

01:12:46.396 --> 01:12:48.630
They just kept laughing.

01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:51.399
So they took her head
and torso out of the room.

01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:55.938
I got my hand free
and got out of there.

01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:57.705

go near the highway.

01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:54.163
Well, you were sentenced
to 25 years to life

01:13:54.164 --> 01:13:57.032
for the murder of Casey,

01:13:57.033 --> 01:13:59.902
because they found two pints
of her blood in your clothing.

01:13:59.903 --> 01:14:02.204
I told all this
to my trial attorney.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:04.006
They had me plead guilty.

01:14:04.007 --> 01:14:06.175

01:14:06.176 --> 01:14:07.843
Yeah, some deal.

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:09.978
The deal was
to keep you off death row.

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:13.948
I bet they're eating
backwoods hillbillies right now.

01:14:15.819 --> 01:14:18.887
I think we have a pretty
good chance for a retrial.

01:14:18.888 --> 01:14:22.023
With your story and the fact
that they never found the body.
