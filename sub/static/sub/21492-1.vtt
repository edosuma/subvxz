00:34.573 --> 00:36.525
Are you kidding me?

01:00.904 --> 01:02.722
Welcome to the early birds' club.

01:03.836 --> 01:05.403
You thought you'd be first?

01:05.791 --> 01:07.632
Yeah, kind of.

01:08.719 --> 01:10.780
I guess we're gonna be
neighbors a while.

01:10.805 --> 01:11.757
I'm Janice Cray.

01:11.782 --> 01:14.451
Hi. I'm August Odenkirk.
You can call me Augie.

01:15.073 --> 01:18.388
- Little one here is Patti.
- Hey, Patti, hello.

01:18.389 --> 01:21.191
- Oh, my God. She is beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:21.192 --> 01:22.459
How old is she?

01:22.761 --> 01:24.295
Almost two months.

01:26.397 --> 01:27.723
I had to bring her.

01:27.842 --> 01:29.264
I can't afford a sitter.

01:29.414 --> 01:32.478
No job, which is, of course,
why I'm here.

01:33.495 --> 01:35.896
Cock-fucking-sucker.

01:36.073 --> 01:38.007
Look at all these people.

01:38.290 --> 01:41.577
Yeah, the economy's back alright.

01:46.860 --> 01:48.795
Croup. It sounds worse than it is.

01:48.894 --> 01:51.163
Right. It's alright.

01:51.235 --> 01:52.743
- Alright, be honest with me.
- Mm-hm.

01:52.822 --> 01:56.482
I'm standing out here in
the cold all night with a baby.

01:56.665 --> 01:58.705
Are would-be employers
gonna just take one look

01:58.752 --> 02:01.252
and think, "Irresponsible"?

02:02.313 --> 02:04.581
Well, they might say, "Dedicated."

02:04.872 --> 02:06.474
And they'll take one look at her

02:06.530 --> 02:08.140
and see that hat
and these mittens here...

02:08.180 --> 02:10.553
which seem to be homemade...

02:10.657 --> 02:13.194
and they'll think, "She pays
attention to detail."

02:13.226 --> 02:14.170
[Baby fussing

02:14.209 --> 02:16.122
You're really good.

02:16.162 --> 02:18.114
Someone's gonna hire you but fast.

02:18.231 --> 02:20.027
Let's hope.

02:20.805 --> 02:22.504
- I'm gonna settle her down.
- Yep.

02:23.823 --> 02:26.558
It's okay, though. It's okay, though.

02:27.122 --> 02:28.585
It's fine, right?

02:42.611 --> 02:44.545
Oh, come on. Really?

02:45.032 --> 02:46.191
Sorry.

02:50.821 --> 02:52.555
Jesus.

02:52.624 --> 02:54.663
- Sorry.
- That's okay. It's alright.

02:54.687 --> 02:56.689
She's hungry.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.692
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

03:00.693 --> 03:03.300
She is soaked right through,
I can feel it.

03:03.387 --> 03:05.903
I can't change her out here
in this cold.

03:06.032 --> 03:08.033
Real forward-thinking on your part.

03:08.058 --> 03:10.721
Sir, back off. Come on.

03:11.304 --> 03:13.865
- What am I gonna do?
- Um...

03:14.240 --> 03:15.974
Here, take my sleeping bag.

03:16.024 --> 03:19.287
Yeah. Slip in, get warm, get her warm.

03:19.341 --> 03:20.984
You know, if you're cool with it,

03:21.024 --> 03:22.447
why don't you hand me over the baby,

03:22.448 --> 03:24.630
and I'll just grab on to her
while you slip in.

03:24.655 --> 03:25.624
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

03:25.663 --> 03:26.786
- Alright, cool. Here. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

03:26.787 --> 03:27.893
No, don't apologize. It's okay.

03:27.933 --> 03:29.321
- It's okay, it's okay.
- It's okay.

03:29.322 --> 03:30.504
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

03:30.529 --> 03:32.171
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

03:32.314 --> 03:34.507
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay.

03:34.566 --> 03:36.500
Are you married?

03:36.596 --> 03:37.729
Divorced.

03:37.824 --> 03:39.435
Kids?

03:39.519 --> 03:40.785
No.

03:40.864 --> 03:41.998
Get a room.

03:42.054 --> 03:44.067
What do you kids call it? Hooking up?

03:44.099 --> 03:45.710
Bro, back off.

03:45.797 --> 03:47.266
Why are you being rude?

03:47.338 --> 03:50.289
Okay, okay. Pass her to me.

03:50.341 --> 03:51.932
It's okay, it's okay.

03:51.972 --> 03:54.154
It's okay. I had her first.
It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

03:54.202 --> 03:55.702
- I know, I know, I know.
- There you go, there you go.

03:55.757 --> 03:56.913
Here, I'll zip you up. I'll zip you up.

03:56.914 --> 03:58.162
- Okay.
- Alright.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.750
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay.

04:00.751 --> 04:01.686
There you go.

04:01.725 --> 04:03.995
- There you go.
- Can you, uh, hand me a diaper?

04:04.027 --> 04:05.555
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- They're in the bag.

04:05.556 --> 04:07.844
I should change her before I feed her.

04:07.892 --> 04:09.701
Got one. Here you go.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.463
- Okay, thank you.
- Here you go.

04:12.629 --> 04:15.241
There's a plastic Costco bag.
You can just drop it in there.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.500
Yeah, nice. Thank you.

04:26.957 --> 04:29.846
- Okay, how's that?
- Okay.

04:31.715 --> 04:33.397
I know, I know.

04:41.236 --> 04:43.157
Hey.

04:43.394 --> 04:45.292
Come on, man.

04:45.601 --> 04:47.625
Kill the headlights.

04:48.110 --> 04:50.737
- Turn 'em off, cow.
- Hmm.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.246
God, showing up to a jobs fair
in a Mercedes-Benz.

04:55.302 --> 04:57.262
Sign of the times, I guess, right?

04:57.341 --> 05:00.294
Maybe it's the Mayor, coming
to check out his big to-do.

05:00.344 --> 05:02.478
He drives one of them sports coupes.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.633
This isn't a coupe.
This is a larger model.

05:07.593 --> 05:10.487
Give up, asshole. Turn them off.

05:28.645 --> 05:30.306
Why's he just waiting there?

05:30.534 --> 05:33.945
Well, one thing's for sure,
we know he's a fucking asshole.

05:42.930 --> 05:44.407
What the hell?

05:48.399 --> 05:50.259
Move.

05:50.327 --> 05:52.305
- Move! Come on, move.
- What?

05:52.346 --> 05:53.994
- Come on, unzip this!
- It's stuck!

06:03.976 --> 06:05.541
Come on, come on! Let's go!

06:05.542 --> 06:07.651
Come on! We've got to go!
Come on! Get up! Get up!

06:09.983 --> 06:11.776
Move!

06:11.840 --> 06:12.880
No, no, no, no, no!

06:12.928 --> 06:14.070
No!

06:55.916 --> 06:57.818
Holy fuck.

07:00.384 --> 07:02.384
It's worse than it looks.

07:03.701 --> 07:07.118
We got 16 dead, triple that in injuries.

07:27.712 --> 07:29.312
No sign of the car.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.386
Car? You're sure it's not a truck?

07:31.648 --> 07:33.230
Car.

07:33.458 --> 07:35.339
Somebody lost control.

07:51.039 --> 07:52.606
He didn't lose control.

08:09.265 --> 08:13.868
_

08:13.908 --> 08:15.089
<i>Good morning, Ohio.</i>

08:45.861 --> 08:47.262
Who is this?

08:47.449 --> 08:49.020
<i>Pete. What, I wake you up?</i>

08:49.147 --> 08:51.576
<i>I keep forgetting
you retired farts sleep all day.</i>

08:57.489 --> 08:59.227
<i>Bill, can you hear me?</i>

08:59.283 --> 09:01.319
- Yeah.
- <i>Alright, see you there.</i>

09:01.391 --> 09:03.812
And wear something nice for me,
would you, big guy?

09:03.885 --> 09:06.272
Maybe one of your
bright spring ensembles?

09:15.359 --> 09:16.693
Fuck.

09:50.654 --> 09:52.078

12:29.225 --> 12:31.422
Not so sweet on the eye yourself.

12:31.471 --> 12:33.834
You getting any exercise?

12:34.064 --> 12:35.365
Are we married?

12:35.508 --> 12:37.366
You hate it, don't you?

12:38.556 --> 12:40.961
- Retirement.
- I don't hate it.

12:41.590 --> 12:43.682
- Hey, handsome.
- Hey, Sheila.

12:43.767 --> 12:44.992
Long time.

12:45.060 --> 12:47.008
- Pete.
- Morning.

12:47.793 --> 12:49.397
Been missing you around here.

12:49.559 --> 12:51.560
Yeah.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.868
You still got that killer smile?

12:53.950 --> 12:55.403
No.

12:57.245 --> 12:58.980
Oh, come on.

13:00.609 --> 13:02.543
Come on.

13:02.611 --> 13:04.429
There it is. How 'bout coffee?

13:04.486 --> 13:06.262
- Why not?
- Okay.

13:06.564 --> 13:08.461
Anything else I can get you boys?

13:08.550 --> 13:11.541
I'll have the, uh, grilled perch
and a side of broccoli.

13:11.612 --> 13:14.176
Yeah, I'll have
the open-faced roast beef

13:14.763 --> 13:16.842
and mashed potato and gravy.

13:17.026 --> 13:19.001
And a beer.

13:19.495 --> 13:21.314
Okay. Got it.

13:23.968 --> 13:25.945
Okay. We know we're not handsome.

13:25.997 --> 13:27.702
We know she knows we're not handsome.

13:27.703 --> 13:30.439
The question becomes,
you think she knows

13:30.464 --> 13:33.361
that we know that she knows
we're not handsome?

13:33.607 --> 13:35.866
That's too much thinking for me.

13:37.921 --> 13:40.755
Hey, how's, uh... how's Allie doing?

13:41.428 --> 13:42.874
You talk?

13:42.993 --> 13:45.852
A bit. She seems good.

13:46.169 --> 13:47.764
You know.

13:48.134 --> 13:49.669
Yeah.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.947
You doing okay?

13:54.796 --> 13:56.531
Yeah.

13:56.771 --> 13:58.620
Really?

14:00.570 --> 14:02.620
It's an adjustment.

14:05.669 --> 14:08.494
I remember you like the rum cake
for an appetizer.

14:08.740 --> 14:10.121
Does that still hold?

14:10.213 --> 14:11.550
That still holds.

14:11.647 --> 14:13.296
I think he's been enjoying
a little too much

14:13.359 --> 14:15.590
of the rum cake lately,
Sheila, wouldn't you agree?

14:16.009 --> 14:17.421
Never.

14:17.818 --> 14:18.821
Hmm!

14:21.492 --> 14:22.990
Why would you say something like that?

14:22.991 --> 14:25.611
Now, come on. Don't tell me your
sense of humor retired, too.

14:25.770 --> 14:27.361
Well, let's just suppose for a second

14:27.362 --> 14:29.151
that maybe she does
find me handsome, you know?

14:29.191 --> 14:31.905
Maybe I'm handsome, maybe I'm not.
She's torn, right?

14:31.967 --> 14:34.969
And your little comment possibly
tips the scales against me.

14:34.970 --> 14:37.538
- Did you ever think of that?
- Mm, mm, I guess I didn't.

14:37.539 --> 14:39.040
- No, you didn't.
- I guess I didn't.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.108
No, you didn't.

14:46.526 --> 14:48.629
It's Pete.

14:49.518 --> 14:51.452
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:52.161 --> 14:54.367
Huh. What?

14:57.254 --> 14:59.040
Huh.

14:59.516 --> 15:00.850
Yeah, yeah. I'll be right there.

15:00.945 --> 15:03.730
Unbelievable. You remember Donald Davis?

15:03.841 --> 15:06.228
That sanctimonious cocksucker
who killed his wife,

15:06.267 --> 15:07.728
- then set up the reward fund
- The reward.

15:07.752 --> 15:09.322
for info leading to her whereabouts?

15:09.347 --> 15:11.948
Game warden just spotted some
old bones and a tattered dress

15:11.987 --> 15:14.844
in a gravel pit, less than
two miles from his house.

15:15.646 --> 15:18.321
Yeah. I am gonna get this bastard.

15:18.547 --> 15:20.148
I'm sorry, I gotta run.

15:20.149 --> 15:21.604
Can we reschedule?

15:21.629 --> 15:22.993
Sure, yeah. I got this. Go. Go.

15:23.018 --> 15:24.772
How about tomorrow for lunch?

15:24.843 --> 15:26.367
- Sounds good.
- Alright.

15:54.722 --> 15:56.476
Something wrong, hon?

15:56.850 --> 15:58.023
What?

15:58.151 --> 16:00.491
With the spoon? Something wrong with it?

16:02.724 --> 16:05.986
Ever notice everything
is upside down on a spoon?

16:06.447 --> 16:08.414
Maybe that's how life is, hon.

16:09.082 --> 16:11.058
That spoon has just got it figured out.

Hey, Brady. How'd it go?

17:45.241 --> 17:47.066
Uh, fine.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.805
Some old lady with a screen-freeze.

17:51.059 --> 17:52.615
How's things here?

17:52.861 --> 17:54.878
Uh, been better.

17:55.186 --> 17:57.821
Evidently, I'm going to Hell.

17:58.535 --> 18:01.527
Some Jesus jumper
gave me chapter and verse.

18:02.010 --> 18:04.670
Turns out the Supreme Court
lacks jurisdiction over God.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.543
What the hell was that?

18:06.606 --> 18:07.945
You were rude to a customer.

18:07.984 --> 18:09.262
Robi, I wasn't rude.

18:09.311 --> 18:12.186
He was kind enough
to give me grooming tips,

18:12.187 --> 18:13.283
and I returned the favor.

18:13.308 --> 18:15.042
I've got in on video, Lou.

18:15.473 --> 18:17.401
<i>You know, if you put on
a little lipum-stickum</i>

18:17.426 --> 18:18.523
<i>and a dog collar...</i>

18:18.548 --> 18:21.165
<i>...you could score yourself
a date at the Corral,</i>

18:21.263 --> 18:24.760
<i>have yourself a squirt
on the Tower of Power.</i>

18:26.855 --> 18:29.419
<i>Thank you for your patronage, sir!</i>

18:29.752 --> 18:32.968
My problem with smart phones
is they don't capture context.

18:33.275 --> 18:35.876
Your behavior was unacceptable.

18:35.877 --> 18:38.946
It reflects on the store, this company,
and my leadership skills.

18:38.947 --> 18:40.310
The three C's, Lou.

18:40.358 --> 18:42.149
Courtesy. Commitment. Consideration.

18:42.199 --> 18:44.183
Does "rude" begin with a C?

18:44.247 --> 18:46.064
Does "abrasive" begin with a C?

18:46.135 --> 18:48.548
I am really bad at phonics.

18:51.145 --> 18:53.675
Brady, Lou.

18:57.531 --> 19:00.062
Need I remind you both...

19:00.182 --> 19:02.086
it is our relational attributes

19:02.142 --> 19:03.697
that keep us from going the route

19:03.753 --> 19:05.878
of the RadioShacks and the Best Buys.

19:05.925 --> 19:08.616
Our ability to be personable
with our cl...

19:09.258 --> 19:10.911
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes.

19:10.912 --> 19:12.742
"Personable" is a P word.

19:14.036 --> 19:15.503
That was flippant.

19:16.408 --> 19:18.210
Y'know, I didn't hire
both of you recalcitrants

19:18.242 --> 19:19.948
just because you're good with computers.

19:19.980 --> 19:21.994
I hired you because you're waywards,

19:22.657 --> 19:24.258
and one of the ways I like to give back

19:24.259 --> 19:25.569
is by being a beacon with waywards.

19:25.843 --> 19:28.136
Shed a little light
on those less-fortunate.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.973
But I got limits, you get my message?

19:31.846 --> 19:34.759
I do. No light for the flippant.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.780
<i>I'd like to say a few
words about the state of our economy</i>

19:41.899 --> 19:45.106
<i>and what we're doing
to put Americans back to work</i>

19:45.225 --> 19:48.131
<i>and build a new foundation for growth.</i>

19:48.483 --> 19:51.623
<i>Last week, we received a report</i>

19:51.679 --> 19:53.487
<i>on America's gross domestic product,</i>

19:53.546 --> 19:55.935
<i>a key measure of our economics health.</i>

19:56.046 --> 19:58.826
<i>And it showed marked improvement</i>

19:58.903 --> 20:01.023
<i>over the last few months.</i>

20:01.087 --> 20:04.567
<i>This morning,
we received additional signs</i>

20:04.623 --> 20:06.834
<i>that the worst may be behind us.</i>

20:07.162 --> 20:10.821
<i>Though we lost 247,000 jobs in July,</i>

20:10.893 --> 20:15.306
<i>that was nearly 200,000 fewer
jobs lost than in June</i>

20:15.444 --> 20:16.576
<i>and far fewer...</i>

20:44.721 --> 20:46.002
What's your problem?

20:46.054 --> 20:51.172
My problem is it costs money
to maintain my garden and lawn,

20:51.568 --> 20:54.005
all for naught when the yard next door

20:54.006 --> 20:55.973
looks like you're raising ticks.

20:55.974 --> 20:56.970
Yeah.

20:57.780 --> 21:00.511
Kid had his SAT tests
or something on Saturday.

21:00.915 --> 21:03.915
Well, that was Saturday.
This is Wednesday.

21:04.010 --> 21:06.017
That's true, Ida.

21:06.067 --> 21:08.010
And here's another little nugget
that can't be denied.

21:08.035 --> 21:09.430
You should mind your own business.

21:09.455 --> 21:11.055
I never mind my business.

21:11.056 --> 21:13.829
Did you call him, tell him
to get his lazy ass over here?

21:13.893 --> 21:16.127
This is the problem
with standardized testing.

21:16.128 --> 21:19.064
- Lawns don't get mowed.
- Have a nice day, Ida.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.742
I'm going to call him.

21:22.468 --> 21:24.870
And tonight, I have some sea bass.

21:24.926 --> 21:26.823
I bought more than I can eat. So...

21:26.894 --> 21:30.116
No need to defrost the
Pepperidge Farm Coconut Cake,

It's a street,
not a goddamn hockey rink.

22:33.958 --> 22:36.007
You're damn lucky
you didn't break that window.

22:36.077 --> 22:37.675
We apologize.

22:37.878 --> 22:40.696
Yeah, well, I'm tired of finding
these things in my shrubs.

22:40.746 --> 22:42.947
Stepped on one last week,
I nearly turned my ankle over.

22:42.979 --> 22:44.348
You hear me?

22:44.757 --> 22:46.388
Do you hear me?!

22:46.439 --> 22:47.454
Yes, sir.

22:51.082 --> 22:52.658
Do you want to play, sir?

22:53.279 --> 22:55.182
We're missing a-a goalie.

22:58.230 --> 22:59.976
Do I look like a goalie to you?

23:01.015 --> 23:03.699
Yeah, just sometimes we see you
watching us through your window.

23:03.746 --> 23:05.429
You know, it's kind of creepy.

23:05.484 --> 23:06.746
But goalies are weird...

23:08.827 --> 23:10.613
...according to ESPN.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.013
You sure you don't want to be a goalie?

23:12.110 --> 23:14.208
You can wear the Jason mask.

23:16.750 --> 23:18.018
Asshole.

23:26.725 --> 23:28.265
It's very good.

23:28.460 --> 23:29.963
Of course it's good.

23:30.062 --> 23:33.465
If I make something, trust
it's gonna be goddamn good.

23:48.376 --> 23:50.666
How long have you had trouble peeing?

23:54.271 --> 23:55.705
Don't give me the look.

23:55.761 --> 23:58.556
I see the Flomax boxes in your garbage.

23:58.740 --> 24:01.930
If you can't be bothered
to recycle, I will.

24:02.533 --> 24:05.668
I buy half my groceries
with your empty beer bottles.

24:07.699 --> 24:11.221
Street hockey kids asked me
to play goalie.

24:11.637 --> 24:13.896
They think I'm weird.

24:14.507 --> 24:16.094
You scare them.

24:16.201 --> 24:17.565
I've heard them talking.

24:24.583 --> 24:27.461
When was the last time you had sex?

24:27.961 --> 24:29.763
Seriously.

24:31.104 --> 24:33.126
You propositioning me, Ida?

24:33.301 --> 24:36.610
Well, what if I am?

24:36.682 --> 24:39.703
- You could do a lot worse.
- That's...

24:40.516 --> 24:42.330
Not to mention I live next door.

24:43.462 --> 24:45.433
There's something to be said
for convenience.

24:45.510 --> 24:47.177
You got it.

24:47.562 --> 24:49.142
Hygiene, as well.

24:49.664 --> 24:51.808
I'd need you to bathe.

24:54.212 --> 24:56.373
Do you?

24:56.707 --> 24:58.477
Are you being serious here?

24:59.516 --> 25:01.152
Face it, Bill,

25:01.334 --> 25:04.278
I'm your only option
if you don't want to pay for it.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.405
Look, you're not an attractive man.

25:07.445 --> 25:08.694
You're out of your mind.

25:17.235 --> 25:19.038
Take a look at that.

25:19.104 --> 25:20.839
That was taken two days ago.

25:22.379 --> 25:24.509
Christ, that's you!

25:24.592 --> 25:25.676
You're buck naked!

25:25.740 --> 25:27.581
Goddamn right I am.

25:28.390 --> 25:30.449
I look incredible!

25:35.697 --> 25:36.763
Let me tell you something.

25:36.788 --> 25:38.575
If you drop dead in that house,

25:38.790 --> 25:42.186
your resale price gets cut
in half, and not just yours.

25:42.797 --> 25:45.964
My property values
might take a whack as well.

25:46.465 --> 25:49.257
So you want to have sex
to protect your resale value.

25:49.282 --> 25:50.916
You're a fucking lunatic.

25:57.478 --> 26:00.065
This physical and emotional inertia...

26:00.224 --> 26:02.049
It's what killed Larry, y'know.

26:03.208 --> 26:05.793
One day he's a college professor.

26:06.188 --> 26:07.991
Then he retires.

26:09.102 --> 26:11.293
Little-by-little, minute-by-minute,

26:11.356 --> 26:15.077
he just retreated from the living.

26:16.561 --> 26:20.133
The depression slithered up
like a constrictor.

26:21.560 --> 26:24.117
A slow, choking death.

26:29.107 --> 26:30.442
It was awful.

26:34.100 --> 26:35.113
Sorry.

26:41.188 --> 26:44.388
You need to find some sort of purpose.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.258
I'll leave it at that.

27:39.837 --> 27:41.851
_

27:51.978 --> 27:53.565
<i>Greetings, Detective.</i>

27:53.636 --> 27:55.557
<i>I hope you don't mind me
using your title,</i>

27:55.660 --> 27:57.724
<i>even though you're now retired.</i>

27:57.803 --> 27:59.645
<i>I'd like to commend you for...</i>

28:25.096 --> 28:28.533
<i>...commend you for 31 years

28:28.771 --> 28:31.518
<i>27 of them as a decorated detective.</i>

28:31.582 --> 28:33.697
<i>I saw one of the retirement ceremonies</i>

28:33.698 --> 28:35.766
<i>on Channel 2... Public Access.</i>

28:36.176 --> 28:38.149
<i>You looked so proud.</i>

28:38.240 --> 28:39.934
<i>Thinner.</i>

28:40.402 --> 28:42.172
<i>You've put on a few.</i>

28:42.307 --> 28:43.918
<i>You must still be proud.</i>

28:44.021 --> 28:46.394
<i>I bet you broke hundreds of cases.</i>

28:46.494 --> 28:49.229
<i>Many of them high-profile.</i>

28:53.118 --> 28:54.743
<i>Tell me, detective.</i>

28:54.853 --> 28:57.122
<i>Did you catch all the bad guys?</i>

28:59.724 --> 29:01.258
<i>We know the answer to that, don't we?</i>

29:01.341 --> 29:04.762
<i>Some of us still lie in our
graves, our murders unavenged.</i>

29:07.136 --> 29:11.168
<i>You made a promise,
you said you'd get him.</i>

29:12.509 --> 29:14.049
<i>But you didn't get him.</i>

29:14.139 --> 29:16.105
<i>He's still out there.</i>

29:16.644 --> 29:19.106
<i>You fucking failed.</i>

29:19.210 --> 29:21.098
<i>Everyone's got an opinion.</i>

29:21.185 --> 29:24.495
<i>And I find the murdered
to be especially unforgiving.</i>

29:25.185 --> 29:26.820
<i>Were any of us on your mind</i>

29:26.876 --> 29:30.366
<i>when they gave you that plaque
at the retirement party?</i>

29:30.755 --> 29:33.262
<i>Did any of them mention me?</i>

29:33.366 --> 29:35.127
<i>Or my little baby?</i>

29:35.611 --> 29:37.889
<i>I barely got to live at all.</i>

29:38.056 --> 29:39.445
<i>Two months.</i>

29:39.537 --> 29:41.471
<i>You got a cocksucking plaque.</i>

29:41.826 --> 29:43.270
<i>I got squished.</i>

29:47.939 --> 29:51.580
<i>A baby, I must say, that was a bonus.</i>

29:51.612 --> 29:52.627
<i>And the mom.</i>

29:52.675 --> 29:55.167
<i>Strawberry jam in a sleeping bag.</i>

29:55.794 --> 29:58.845
<i>Did you know I was actually
wearing a condom that night?</i>

29:59.036 --> 30:01.321
<i>So much excitement.</i>

30:01.631 --> 30:06.492
<i>I was afraid I might
spontaneously ejaculate!</i>

30:06.555 --> 30:09.920
<i>And I'd have to worry about DNA.</i>

30:10.190 --> 30:13.135
<i>As for my two cents,
I'm just missing the ending.</i>

30:13.198 --> 30:14.746
<i>You promised one, 'member?</i>

30:15.333 --> 30:18.495
<i>Take a good look at me, buddy.
I'm coming for you.</i>

30:19.281 --> 30:21.217
<i>I'm coming.</i>

30:21.765 --> 30:24.104
<i>I'm coming! I'm coming!</i>

30:24.152 --> 30:27.194
<i>Auntie Em, Auntie Em!</i>

30:27.574 --> 30:29.042
<i>Hey, guess what?</i>

30:29.147 --> 30:30.686
<i>I'm coming, too.</i>

30:32.698 --> 30:34.444
<i>Talk later, buddy.</i>

30:34.830 --> 30:36.699
<i>My love to Fred.</i>

32:03.320 --> 32:04.781
Jerome.

32:08.287 --> 32:09.660
Jerome!

32:09.715 --> 32:11.691
- Shit!
- Turn it off!

32:13.451 --> 32:15.185
It's 6:30 in the morning.

32:15.232 --> 32:17.836
Yeah, that crazy-ass lady
next door called me

32:17.899 --> 32:20.280
and said if I don't mow your
lawn today...

32:20.391 --> 32:22.210
Look, it's now or never, boss.

32:22.927 --> 32:24.829
You any good at computers?

32:25.795 --> 32:28.330
Yeah. You know I am.

32:28.686 --> 32:30.335
Get your ass in here, then.

32:31.269 --> 32:32.937
It just disappeared?

32:33.024 --> 32:34.342
Yeah. I played it once.

32:34.405 --> 32:36.342
Went to play it again.
Gone. Whole thing vanished.

32:36.382 --> 32:39.254
- And you didn't accidentally trash it?
- I did nothing.

32:42.198 --> 32:45.356
Is it possible for a file
to just disappear on its own?

32:47.102 --> 32:48.499
I mean, yes, but you'd be talking

32:48.539 --> 32:50.487
some very high-end software and shit.

32:51.894 --> 32:54.543
- What was on the file?
- It's not important.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.194
If it ain't important, then
why are you so out of joint?

32:58.265 --> 33:00.170
Aside that being
your normal personality.

33:00.210 --> 33:01.686
Do you want me to smack you?

33:01.723 --> 33:04.612
If you got homeowner's, yeah.
Shit, I could use the money.

33:04.667 --> 33:07.237
Just tell me... can the video
be retrieved, or not?

33:10.030 --> 33:11.395
I mean, I don't know.

33:11.454 --> 33:12.588
Maybe.

33:12.736 --> 33:14.645
You can never really
delete anything completely.

33:14.776 --> 33:17.032
It's just not on the surface, though.

33:17.126 --> 33:18.452
Okay.

33:18.650 --> 33:20.667
Look, I'm gonna need more time.

33:20.985 --> 33:23.127
Whoever did this knows his shit.

33:26.391 --> 33:28.830
♪ I don't wanna make a buck no more ♪

33:28.893 --> 33:31.661
♪ I don't wanna be a bum no more ♪

33:31.717 --> 33:34.169
♪ I don't want your spit,
I don't want your hate ♪

33:34.257 --> 33:35.966
♪ I need more than... ♪

33:48.696 --> 33:51.371
<i>Carrie and Shane from Katori
team were in third position</i>

33:51.396 --> 33:53.434
<i>before starting today's challenge.</i>

33:53.474 --> 33:55.173
<i>They made great time
over the suspension bridge,</i>

33:55.229 --> 33:59.062
<i>which has pushed them ahead of
both the Raza and Hilu teams.</i>

33:59.126 --> 34:00.565
<i>Will they be able to hold</i>

34:00.589 --> 34:01.708
- <i>their lead through the jungle...</i>
- Hey.

34:01.733 --> 34:03.025
<i>...and get to the river
to claim victory?</i>

34:03.057 --> 34:05.279
- I brought lunch.
- Alright.

34:05.494 --> 34:08.063
Hey, look, I'm watching "Primitive."

34:08.250 --> 34:10.197
Come join, it's a goodie.

34:11.039 --> 34:14.972
I would, but I've got
to do work and then head back.

34:14.973 --> 34:17.587
Oh, what's this big project
you got going?

34:17.679 --> 34:19.710
Uh, new kind of router.

34:20.068 --> 34:22.710
Come on, come on, sit with me.

34:22.806 --> 34:25.409
Come on, honey, sit with me for
just a second, could you, baby?

34:25.425 --> 34:27.715
Come on. Just a sec.

34:33.815 --> 34:38.451
I'm concerned about these
circles under your eyes, okay?

34:38.498 --> 34:39.966
I think you're working too hard

34:39.991 --> 34:42.078
with all these different jobs
you got going.

34:42.118 --> 34:43.667
Well, if I wanna go to college,

34:43.668 --> 34:46.179
I've gotta earn money
to pay for it, right?

34:47.092 --> 34:50.408
My baby, the college boy.

34:52.456 --> 34:55.167
But it can't be all work
and no play, honey.

34:55.813 --> 34:58.381
Young person has to have
some kind of social life.

34:58.448 --> 35:00.048
I've got friends.

35:00.351 --> 35:01.476
Who?

35:01.557 --> 35:03.421
The lesbian?

35:03.488 --> 35:07.872
Or that boss who's nothing
but mean to you, huh?

35:07.935 --> 35:10.134
- They're okay.
- Mm-hmm.

35:10.705 --> 35:13.150
You need a little fun in your life,

35:13.498 --> 35:15.300
that's all I'm saying, okay?

35:18.436 --> 35:20.592
Hey, why is it you never
had a girlfriend?

35:20.651 --> 35:22.076
Hmm?

35:22.574 --> 35:26.001
I just don't understand this. I mean...

35:27.017 --> 35:30.620
Look, I'm not find... finding
fault with you, honey, no.

35:31.335 --> 35:33.885
In fact, just the opposite.

35:34.252 --> 35:38.694
You're smart. You're resourceful.

35:39.432 --> 35:41.583
And you're good-looking.

35:42.460 --> 35:45.538
Do you know how good-looking you are?

35:47.340 --> 35:50.867
I would think the girls
would drip off you.

35:51.038 --> 35:52.281
No.

35:52.570 --> 35:54.736
I got to do work, so...

35:54.939 --> 35:57.101
No, wait, wait.

35:57.342 --> 35:59.529
Give Mommy a little kiss.

35:59.680 --> 36:02.413
Can you do that?
Give me a little kiss first.

36:12.090 --> 36:13.743
My honey boy.

36:16.027 --> 36:18.594
Uh, no, no, no.

36:20.594 --> 36:24.234
Work, work, work, work, work, work,

36:24.304 --> 36:28.963
work, work, work, work, work,
work, work, work, work, work.

36:43.412 --> 36:46.293
<i>Give Mommy a little kiss.</i>

37:29.367 --> 37:30.630
Chaos.

37:31.957 --> 37:35.618
<i>19, 18, 17, 16,</i>

37:35.713 --> 37:40.698
<i>15, 14, 13, 12, 11,</i>

37:40.841 --> 37:47.025
<i>10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4...</i>

37:47.081 --> 37:48.852
Darkness.

37:59.330 --> 38:01.759
It's killing you, isn't it?

38:01.866 --> 38:05.599
Truth be told, I don't
really miss it too much.

38:07.079 --> 38:09.555
- Right.
- I'm serious.

38:13.335 --> 38:15.115
Except maybe...

38:16.051 --> 38:17.918
cases still hanging fire.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.867
I dwell on them a bit.

38:22.592 --> 38:25.124
Starting with right there...

38:25.434 --> 38:27.326
The City Park Rapist.

38:28.334 --> 38:30.596
Can't believe we didn't get him.

38:30.690 --> 38:32.922
Yeah. We will.

38:33.160 --> 38:35.978
Thing about rapists,
they always strike again.

38:36.605 --> 38:38.613
Then, there's the Mercedes killer.

38:38.676 --> 38:40.128
Anything new on that?

38:40.176 --> 38:41.390
Nah.

38:41.438 --> 38:42.839
I ain't sure there ever will be.

38:42.930 --> 38:46.021
Been what, two years? Likely a one-off.

38:46.236 --> 38:49.402
My money, he was probably
coming to the job fair,

38:49.458 --> 38:50.847
saw the long line ahead of him,
and flipped out.

38:51.886 --> 38:55.365
He stole a Mercedes to go to a job fair?
That doesn't make sense.

38:56.682 --> 38:58.404
Is the case still active?

38:58.523 --> 39:00.603
I mean, for real,
anybody doing actual work on it?

39:00.658 --> 39:02.476
It's active, Bill.

39:03.661 --> 39:05.420
You're never gonna let it go, are you?

39:06.155 --> 39:07.952
Just making conversation.

39:10.786 --> 39:13.897
Camaraderie for my health.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.575
Ah, okay.

39:17.341 --> 39:18.567
Ah.

39:19.377 --> 39:21.758
She killed herself, y'know. That's new.

39:22.016 --> 39:23.483
Olivia Trelawney.

39:23.551 --> 39:25.225
The woman whose Mercedes was stolen.

39:25.616 --> 39:27.598
Yeah, Pete, I know who she was.

39:27.773 --> 39:29.908
She owned some blame after all.

39:30.074 --> 39:31.696
Swallowed some pills.

39:33.344 --> 39:34.759
Fuck.

39:37.094 --> 39:38.807
Was it ever disclosed

39:38.918 --> 39:41.487
Smiley Face sticker
was found on the steering wheel?

39:41.933 --> 39:43.184
Don't think so.

39:44.422 --> 39:45.811
What about the Clown Face?

39:45.883 --> 39:49.613
Ever reported witnesses saw the
driver wearing the mask, or...

39:49.986 --> 39:51.494
Why do you ask?

39:51.534 --> 39:53.276
Ah, it was never recovered, right?

39:55.411 --> 39:56.737
Just wondering.

40:10.328 --> 40:14.497
Here you go, Mr. Tech Whiz,
six out calls.

40:14.664 --> 40:17.585
Uh, I was actually planning
to leave by 3:00.

40:18.426 --> 40:20.934
- You were planning to leave by 3:00?
- My other job.

40:21.005 --> 40:22.727
You have another job?

40:22.965 --> 40:25.584
What is this other vocation, Brady?

40:25.854 --> 40:29.338
Inventing space ships with Elon Muskrat,
whatever the fuck his name is?

40:29.378 --> 40:32.473
- Back off, Robi.
- I will not back off.

40:33.751 --> 40:35.608
Now, whether you choose
to see me as such or not,

40:35.640 --> 40:37.076
I'm sort of your mentor in life.

40:37.417 --> 40:40.352
Oh, yeah. He's going into
full beacon mode.

40:40.383 --> 40:41.591
Go ahead. Beam us.

40:41.630 --> 40:43.851
You ain't got a father.

40:43.876 --> 40:46.429
And your mother, well...
I mean, no offense,

40:46.430 --> 40:49.752
I like the vodka myself,
but not on my Rice Krispies,

40:50.201 --> 40:51.634
if you get my drift.

40:51.974 --> 40:54.760
You need to take good mentor
advice where you can get it.

40:55.109 --> 40:57.107
This is your job right here, Brady.

40:57.156 --> 40:58.474
This is your career.

40:58.509 --> 40:59.998
You sticker DVDs,

41:00.045 --> 41:02.012
you help old fackakas with dementia

41:02.013 --> 41:03.380
get Polident out of their laptops.

41:03.418 --> 41:05.866
There's nothing wrong with that.
It's a role in society.

41:05.905 --> 41:07.848
A lot of people don't got roles. You do.

41:08.215 --> 41:10.397
But you will never be happy

41:10.445 --> 41:12.521
unless you both appreciate what you have

41:12.577 --> 41:14.725
and accept what you are.

41:23.391 --> 41:26.463
You're positive you
didn't download any application?

41:26.502 --> 41:28.739
I don't even know how to download.

41:29.930 --> 41:32.787
Well, there's all kinds of software
to make files disappear and shit,

41:32.850 --> 41:35.422
but both parties
need to have it installed,

41:35.469 --> 41:38.158
and I can't find anything.

41:38.745 --> 41:41.896
Could he have hacked my computer
and then downloaded it?

41:42.953 --> 41:44.436
I don't know.

41:44.491 --> 41:46.793
It's possible, some kind
of malware or something.

41:49.894 --> 41:52.095
Can you at least tell me what you saw?

41:52.992 --> 41:54.587
It's private.

41:54.965 --> 41:57.794
Nothing's private anymore.

42:00.971 --> 42:02.593
You expecting somebody?

42:02.707 --> 42:04.538
No.

42:06.704 --> 42:08.061
Are you serious?

42:08.133 --> 42:09.180
Stay where you are.

42:13.870 --> 42:16.061
Oh, for God's sake.

42:16.587 --> 42:18.321
And what's he doing here?

42:19.251 --> 42:20.966
We're having a party.

42:23.420 --> 42:25.253
What do you want, Ida?

42:25.356 --> 42:26.840
I'd like a minute.

42:26.962 --> 42:28.705
Alone, if possible.

42:31.982 --> 42:34.140
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

42:40.811 --> 42:42.813
Yeah?

42:44.081 --> 42:45.927
You hurt my feelings.

42:45.975 --> 42:47.475
I wasn't gonna say anything,

42:47.506 --> 42:50.348
but keeping pain to myself
is not a strength.

42:51.181 --> 42:53.736
Should you desire or not desire

42:53.784 --> 42:55.267
to have sexual relations with me...

42:55.292 --> 42:56.693
certainly your choice...

42:56.736 --> 43:00.720
I take well-earned pride
in my physical appearance.

43:01.653 --> 43:04.010
- That's what this is about?
- Yes.

43:04.301 --> 43:07.170
For you to be so repulsed by my body...

43:07.171 --> 43:08.676
I wasn't repulsed.

43:08.839 --> 43:10.605
You nearly gagged on your own vomit.

43:10.668 --> 43:11.924
I was repulsed by the fact

43:11.956 --> 43:14.043
that you were showing me
naked photographs of yourself.

43:14.099 --> 43:16.448
I wasn't reacting to how you looked.

43:16.679 --> 43:18.560
I'm a handsome woman.

43:18.632 --> 43:19.925
I never said you weren't.

43:19.981 --> 43:23.108
And yet you couldn't bring yourself
to look at the pictures.

43:23.586 --> 43:24.967
You recoiled.

43:24.999 --> 43:26.260
Come on. I didn't recoil.

43:26.292 --> 43:27.925
You recoiled. I saw it.

43:29.782 --> 43:31.576
What do you want from me, Ida?

43:32.371 --> 43:34.373
I want you to look at the picture.

43:37.232 --> 43:38.962
You want me to look at the picture.

43:39.002 --> 43:41.057
- Yes.
- For what purpose?

43:41.398 --> 43:44.251
Because you're my neighbor
and I want to be friends with you.

43:44.283 --> 43:46.212
And I don't think I can
be friends with somebody

43:46.237 --> 43:48.344
who recoils at the sight
of my naked body.

43:48.806 --> 43:52.093
I realize that's a deficit
of mine but I am what I am.

43:55.286 --> 43:56.487
Fine.

44:08.347 --> 44:09.585
Very nice.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.804
It's lovely.

44:23.684 --> 44:26.438
Jesus fucking Christ!

44:48.307 --> 44:51.736
_

45:56.857 --> 45:58.341
Just got me thinking.

45:58.409 --> 46:00.677
All the pranks and taunts
and shit we got with that case.

46:00.678 --> 46:01.830
Has that continued?

46:01.862 --> 46:03.687
You know, anything recent happen that...

46:04.156 --> 46:06.148
No. Why do you ask?

46:07.695 --> 46:09.243
Just told you, I'm curious.

46:09.377 --> 46:11.177
You're, uh, curious?

46:12.124 --> 46:14.100
I worked a long time on that case.

46:14.235 --> 46:16.942
After our conversation
yesterday, just got me thinking.

46:17.013 --> 46:19.495
Ah, that conversation we had
about the Park Rapist

46:19.562 --> 46:21.593
that you segued into a conversation

46:21.641 --> 46:23.299
about the Mercedes killer.
That conversation?

46:23.300 --> 46:24.634
Why you talking to me like that?

46:24.635 --> 46:27.681
Because of all the cases
for you to obsesses over,

46:27.706 --> 46:28.839
- this is the one...
- I'm not obsessing,

46:28.840 --> 46:30.216
I just asked you
any recent suspicious...

46:30.241 --> 46:31.399
...more than any other
that led to your demise.

46:31.424 --> 46:32.913
No, listen, never mind!

46:32.938 --> 46:35.445
Bill, you need to never mind.

46:35.567 --> 46:38.686
16 people died,
we're meant to just forget it?

46:38.734 --> 46:40.583
I'm not, I'm still on the case.

46:40.638 --> 46:42.805
You're meant to forget it,
you're retired.

46:43.059 --> 46:44.321
I'm going to work.

47:27.631 --> 47:29.500
Good morning, sir.

47:31.087 --> 47:33.775
Uh, do you carry surveillance cameras?

47:34.278 --> 47:35.604
Uh, why yes we do, sir...

47:35.635 --> 47:38.107
security cams, nanny cams, drop cams,

47:38.108 --> 47:39.985
and we can not only
provide the equipment,

47:40.024 --> 47:42.078
we can service all your
installation needs as well.

47:42.117 --> 47:45.491
I can install it myself,
I just want the merchandise.

47:45.942 --> 47:47.752
It's right over there.

47:49.998 --> 47:52.656
Actually, let me show you
where it's located.

47:56.727 --> 47:59.293
One can never take security
too seriously,

47:59.365 --> 48:01.095
that's what I always say.

48:01.301 --> 48:03.599
We live in an increasingly
dangerous world.

48:03.633 --> 48:05.371
Vigilance is an American value.

48:05.402 --> 48:08.086
"One if by land. Two if by sea."

48:08.149 --> 48:09.760
Our wonderful country began with that.

48:09.808 --> 48:10.840
Give it a rest, would you?

48:10.879 --> 48:13.110
Yeah, sure, I'll just leave you
with the merchandise.

48:17.402 --> 48:18.870
Is this good?

48:20.256 --> 48:22.190
Yeah, that's... that's a good one.

48:22.230 --> 48:23.783
Thanks.

48:24.688 --> 48:26.423
- I'll take this.
- Yes, sir.

48:42.705 --> 48:44.335
Not a chance.

48:45.915 --> 48:47.313
This will be the last time, I swear.

48:47.338 --> 48:48.567
You said the last time
would be the last time.

48:48.606 --> 48:50.179
- And the time before that.
- Yeah.

48:50.232 --> 48:52.986
- I promise, this will be the last time.
- You're a civilian.

48:53.080 --> 48:56.041
I give civilians access
to evidence, I lose my job.

48:56.120 --> 48:57.486
Marty.

48:57.588 --> 49:00.893
My therapist is saying
I gotta get closure and shit.

49:01.434 --> 49:04.599
Personally, I think closure's
over-fucking-rated.

49:04.694 --> 49:06.796
But the nightmares, the panic
attacks, I could do without.

49:06.797 --> 49:08.307
He says I gotta take certain steps.

49:08.361 --> 49:10.085
This is one of 'em.

49:10.346 --> 49:11.711
Five minutes.

49:11.775 --> 49:13.926
I'll let you hold the watch, you
know, the expensive watch I got

49:13.966 --> 49:15.966
for 36 years of distinguished service.

49:16.245 --> 49:17.473
Please.

49:24.115 --> 49:25.441
Appreciate it.

51:48.492 --> 51:51.133
Hey, you want maybe I can angle
that one into Ida's backyard?

51:51.680 --> 51:53.807
You could watch her
sunbathe in the nude.

51:53.922 --> 51:56.101
She'd like that.

51:57.901 --> 52:00.307
I want a full panoramic
if you can get it.

52:00.387 --> 52:01.704
Yeah, you got it.

52:02.973 --> 52:05.354
You ever thought about
getting a guard dog?

52:05.402 --> 52:08.077
Um, not that your turtle ain't scary.

52:08.211 --> 52:09.741
It's a tortoise.

52:09.838 --> 52:11.140
Oh.

52:12.275 --> 52:14.051
And you got into Harvard.

52:14.985 --> 52:16.488
Yeah, I did.

52:17.274 --> 52:20.022
You know, we could program
this shit right into your iPhone

52:20.083 --> 52:21.790
so you can watch it from anywhere.

52:21.861 --> 52:23.512
In some movie theater, bored to shit

52:23.559 --> 52:26.009
over whether Iron Man's
getting it on with Wonder Woman,

52:26.238 --> 52:30.341
you just whip out your phone,
and see who's breaking into your house.

52:30.730 --> 52:32.598
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

52:37.582 --> 52:40.407
Ooh, okay. How 'bout we take a break,

52:40.542 --> 52:43.955
and you treat me to a Whistle Pop.

52:44.574 --> 52:46.416
That's an ice cream, boss.

52:50.303 --> 52:52.938
I'll have a brownie delight,
no whipped cream.

52:53.795 --> 52:56.180
Ooh, watching your figure, are you?

52:56.601 --> 52:58.045
So help me, I will smack you.

52:58.070 --> 52:59.695
- You know that, don't you?
- Okay, I'm kidding.

53:05.888 --> 53:07.562
Fucking kids.

53:07.634 --> 53:09.499
Hello, friendly friends!

53:09.602 --> 53:11.707
Can I have Berry Good, please?

53:11.708 --> 53:12.708
Oof, well that depends.

53:12.709 --> 53:14.902
- Have you been a Berry Good girl?
- Yes.

53:14.927 --> 53:16.879
Well, then I guess you can have one.

53:20.180 --> 53:22.339
There you go, sweetheart.

53:53.352 --> 53:54.750
Who's next?
