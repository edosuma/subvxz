Previously on The Practice.

00:04.137 --> 00:06.840
This case is completely
circumstantial.
We have a very good shot.

00:06.907 --> 00:09.276
Plus, we have grounds
for an appeal.
Let's not forget that.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.746
You guys have nothin' to worry
about. There's no way they're
gonna convict your client.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.082
- Oh, you were in the courtroom?
- I'm on the jury.

00:15.149 --> 00:19.153
<i>I had a communication</i>
<i>with a juror.</i>
<i>I gotta go to the judge.</i>

00:19.220 --> 00:20.922
But you didn't
communicate with him.

00:20.988 --> 00:24.859
But even so, technically,
under the rules,
we have a mistrial.

00:24.926 --> 00:28.530
I don't see
how it has any effect.
I say we don't tell.

00:28.596 --> 00:31.132
<i>[ Woman ] On the matter</i>
<i>of the</i> Commonwealth

Sentencing next Tuesday, 9:00.

00:37.139 --> 00:39.707
[ Ellenor ] Don't say anything.
I'm coming right back
to talk to you.

00:39.774 --> 00:42.710
Okay? Just don't say anything.
I've got a plan.

00:42.777 --> 00:46.048
The guilty verdict stands.
As for the two of you,

00:46.114 --> 00:48.483
I'll be recommending
immediate disbarment.

00:48.550 --> 00:52.120
You risked your careers.
You completely jeopardized the
reputation of this entire firm.

00:52.187 --> 00:56.792
You got a murderer off
on the moral integrity of his
cold-blooded execution.

00:56.859 --> 01:00.263
What exactly do you think
our reputation is here, Bobby?

01:03.299 --> 01:05.468
It wasn't suicide.

01:05.534 --> 01:07.937
You can state that
for a medical certainty?

01:08.004 --> 01:10.940
Mr. Wiggins
had no suicidal tendencies,
in my professional--

01:11.007 --> 01:15.211
You can state it
to a medical certainty
it wasn't suicide?

01:15.278 --> 01:18.281
I'm a psychiatrist,
not a medical examiner, but--

01:18.347 --> 01:21.818
[ Bobby ] So you can't rule out
suicide as a cause of death.
Correct, Doctor?

01:21.885 --> 01:24.588
That would be correct.
But I--
Thank you, Doctor.

01:24.654 --> 01:27.857
And, Doctor,
have you had other patients
who did commit suicide?

01:27.924 --> 01:29.759
Yes.
How many?

01:29.826 --> 01:32.796
<i>I'm not sure.</i>
[ Bobby ]
More than five?

01:32.862 --> 01:35.432
<i>Probably.</i>
More than 10?

01:35.499 --> 01:38.602
I'd say between five and 10.
I'd have to check my files.

01:38.668 --> 01:42.272
<i>And of those suicides,</i>
<i>was there ever one</i>
<i>you didn't see coming?</i>

01:42.339 --> 01:44.809
For most of those occasions,
I saw some symptomology--

01:44.875 --> 01:47.845
Was there ever an occasion where
the suicide surprised you?

01:47.912 --> 01:50.648
Someone you didn't
deem suicidal
took his or her life--

01:50.715 --> 01:52.517
Has that ever happened?
<i>Yes, but--</i>

01:52.583 --> 01:56.621
Thank you.
So it does happen,
doesn't it, Doctor?

01:56.687 --> 02:00.858
A patient with no apparent
suicidal tendencies
takes his life. It happens.

02:00.926 --> 02:03.929
- That's argumentative
and badgering.
- This is a cross-examination.

02:03.995 --> 02:06.331
I would submit the doctor
is being argumentative.

02:06.397 --> 02:09.735
Let's just have a nice,
civil murder trial,
shall we?

02:10.936 --> 02:12.904
Doctor,

02:12.971 --> 02:16.675
according to your testimony,
Mr. Wiggins became upset
to learn of the affair...

02:16.742 --> 02:19.411
between his wife
and Mr. Forsythe, didn't he?

02:19.478 --> 02:23.315
<i>Upset, yes.</i>
<i>I didn't say despondent.</i>

02:23.382 --> 02:26.352
Well, is it possible
he could have
become despondent...

02:26.418 --> 02:30.722
to learn his wife of 12 years
was sleeping with another man?

02:30.790 --> 02:34.994
To me, he seemed
more enraged than depressed.

02:35.061 --> 02:37.764
Are you telling this court
he wasn't depressed about it?

02:37.830 --> 02:41.834
I'm telling this court
I don't think
he committed suicide.

02:41.901 --> 02:44.971
Of course you don't want to
think that. You were
his treating psychiatrist.

02:45.037 --> 02:48.575
Suicide would represent
yourfailure,
wouldn't it, Doctor?

02:48.641 --> 02:52.179
Hey. I prescribed medication.
He refused to take it.

02:52.245 --> 02:55.182
- He refused to take drugs.
Any drugs.
- Move to strike. Nonresponsive.

02:55.248 --> 02:58.185
<i>There is no way</i>
<i>he would willingly</i>
<i>take Seconal.</i>

02:58.251 --> 02:59.987
Move to strike!

03:00.053 --> 03:01.955
You were way too aggressive.

03:02.022 --> 03:04.324
Too aggressive?
He was throwing
dirt on the coffin.

03:04.391 --> 03:08.028
He put the final nail in.
Andrea, have you been
paying attention? We're losing.

03:08.095 --> 03:09.730
It's still all circumstantial.

a dead husband?

03:12.566 --> 03:15.303
They found her drugs
inside of him.
This is a nightmare.

They're innocent, Bobby.
You know that as well as I do.
It doesn't matter what we know.

03:19.140 --> 03:22.043

some kind of specialist
on disability claims, so I--

- No.

just blew a hole through

if we were going to
do something like this...

we would have made sure
we had an alibi?

Well, that's a good thought,

a tough question.

<i>Mary Jane said</i>
<i>she went to the movies.</i>

- No.

Hey. If either of us were to be
singled out as more likely,
it would probably be me.

- I-- I don't follow.
- [ Sighs ]

13:06.817 --> 13:08.819
She still loved him.

13:08.885 --> 13:13.190
In fact, a couple of days
before he died, she said she was
thinking of going back with him.

13:13.257 --> 13:16.960
The two of us were fighting.
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

13:17.027 --> 13:21.032
'Cause it doesn't matter.

The point I'm making is this:

13:25.069 --> 13:29.106
though she couldn't
live with John anymore,
she still loved him a lot.

13:29.173 --> 13:31.976
She never would have
considered hurting him.

13:32.043 --> 13:34.345
She-- She wasn't worried
about the prenup?

13:34.412 --> 13:38.516
She didn't care about his money.
She didn't even want his money.

13:38.583 --> 13:40.985
What about pointing the finger
at somebody else?

13:41.052 --> 13:42.920
There are two employees
at Wiggins...

13:42.987 --> 13:46.591
who were in a big power struggle
tryin' to squeeze him out.
So they kill him?

13:46.658 --> 13:50.028
Nah. The first rule in defense
law is don't offer a theory
you can't prove, remember?

13:50.095 --> 13:52.164
Well, we gotta think of
something, Andrea.

13:52.230 --> 13:54.099
What about accident?
We could go back to that.

13:54.166 --> 13:58.170
No. You heard the M.E.
He said it was way too much
Seconal to be accidental.

13:58.236 --> 14:00.072
He could be wrong.
All we need is doubt.

14:00.138 --> 14:03.276
You realize we got two people
who basically, because they
committed adultery,

14:03.342 --> 14:05.344
are about to be convicted
of a homicide?

14:05.411 --> 14:07.813
Yeah. The problem
is that the Seconal
was mixed with wine.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.783
If the guy wanted to commit
suicide, why wouldn't he just
swallow the pills?

14:10.849 --> 14:13.920
Why grind it up and mix it
with wine? That's the question
we gotta answer.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.889
Maybe he was hoping
it would look like murder.

14:15.955 --> 14:18.657
I mean,
that would be a great way
to get even, wouldn't it?

14:18.725 --> 14:21.060
Yeah. Another theory
we can't prove.

Under Massachusetts law,

16:20.784 --> 16:23.354
Officer Rydell suffers
a permanent partial disability,

16:23.421 --> 16:25.990
which constrains him from
working in his selected field.

16:26.057 --> 16:28.993
Racism is not
a recognized disability.

16:29.060 --> 16:33.397
The law recognizes mental
distress produced by prolonged
work-related anxiety.

Mr. Rydell did not suffer
this condition of irrational
discrimination based on race...

16:38.403 --> 16:41.440

You're going on record that

this job has caused him
to suffer racist tendencies.

Nobody's blaming the department.

17:19.279 --> 17:21.815

And frankly, Mr. Rydell,
I'm a little sickened
by this petition.

Let me tell you
what sickens me, Mr. Crane.

17:27.788 --> 17:31.392
Last summer, me and my partner
were investigating
a "B" and "E" call.

17:31.458 --> 17:34.127
At the scene, I--
I see a man I think has a gun.

17:34.194 --> 17:37.198
A black man.
I opened fire and killed him.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.266
He didn't have a gun,
Mr. Crane.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.468
He had a lighter.

17:41.535 --> 17:44.705

it was an honest mistake,
and I was cleared.

If this man
with the lighter was white,
would I have fired on him?

18:12.234 --> 18:16.939

He's black, so I see a gun.

<i>This man had a wife,</i>
<i>two daughters,</i>
<i>runs a shoe shop.</i>

18:21.343 --> 18:23.879
He was the man who called in
the "B" and "E."

18:25.113 --> 18:27.149
Now, as sure
as I'm sitting here,

18:27.216 --> 18:31.887
I know I was quick
to pull the trigger
because he was black.

18:33.222 --> 18:36.025
I can't tell
another judge what to do.

18:42.398 --> 18:45.602
They were wrong.
Judge Stevens was right.
Technically.

That's the way
we do things here, Bobby:
technically.

Seven years ago,
I had a client who raped
and killed three children.

The police coerced a confession
out of him. I stood before
a certain judge...

18:58.315 --> 19:02.086
and argued that
the confession be tossed
on constitutional grounds.

19:02.152 --> 19:06.623

even though she knew
he was guilty.

<i>She released the defendant</i>
<i>on technical grounds.</i>

<i>he killed another child.</i>

19:16.334 --> 19:18.803
The lawyer cried for a week.

19:19.737 --> 19:23.208
And I suspect
the judge did too.

19:23.274 --> 19:26.011
Are you comparing
that case to this one?

19:26.077 --> 19:31.549
<i>I'm suggesting doing</i>
<i>what's right, by the book,</i>
<i>doesn't always work.</i>

19:31.616 --> 19:36.354
Let me suggest to you
judges and lawyers take an oath
to this judicial process,

19:36.421 --> 19:38.624
and that oath isn't waivable.

19:38.690 --> 19:40.859
We both need to
cling to that, don't we?

19:40.926 --> 19:43.495
That case isn't this case.

19:43.562 --> 19:46.465
Both cases involve doing
what's technically right,

19:46.532 --> 19:49.735
resulting in
a greater injustice.

19:49.801 --> 19:53.973
Ellenor Frutt and Lindsay Dole
were both wrong.
No dispute.

19:54.040 --> 19:58.010
But to face disbarment--
that-- that's a much
greater injustice.

we need a quick check...

20:08.321 --> 20:10.257
We don't want to get surprised
by any skeletons.

but just to be safe--
- Oh, I'm sure he's legit.

21:01.175 --> 21:03.612
I'm not tellin' you, Lindsay.

something to do with me, as you
say, you owe me an explanation.

No. I know.

I see.
Whenever I have
relations with a girl,

21:52.195 --> 21:56.900
it's hard for me
to look at her after,
on account of my Catholic guilt.

21:56.967 --> 22:01.238
And in my mind,
it's as if you and I had sex.

22:01.305 --> 22:03.607

So, he ground it up

Why would he do that?

22:57.964 --> 23:00.199
I don't know.

Considerably less.

23:36.704 --> 23:39.274
Mrs. Wiggins,
you'd have to admit
how this looks.

23:39.340 --> 23:43.244
You had motive, opportunity,
you were the last one seen
with your husband alive,

23:43.311 --> 23:44.912
you have no alibi.

23:44.979 --> 23:48.183
All you have here
is your word, isn't it?

23:48.249 --> 23:50.551
I suppose that would be so.

23:50.618 --> 23:54.389
And are you good for your word,
Mrs. Wiggins?
Are you somebody to trust?

23:54.455 --> 23:57.225
- Objection.
Argumentative and badgering.
- Overruled.

23:57.292 --> 23:59.495
- Your Honor.
- Overruled. Sit.

23:59.561 --> 24:02.564
[ Pratt ]
You lied to your husband
for two years, didn't you?

24:04.700 --> 24:06.735
Did you not hear
my question, ma'am?

24:06.802 --> 24:10.439
Did you not lie to
and continue to betray your
husband's trust for two years?

24:10.506 --> 24:13.709
- I'm not proud about
deceiving my husband.
- <i>He did trust you, didn't he?</i>

24:13.775 --> 24:16.045
<i>I suppose he did. Yes.</i>

24:16.112 --> 24:20.216
I suppose if you were to offer
him a glass of wine, he'd glady
accept without a second thought.

24:20.282 --> 24:22.184
- Objection.
- Sustained.

24:22.251 --> 24:25.955
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill my husband.

24:26.022 --> 24:29.158
Yes. We have your word on that.
Your word of honor.

24:34.697 --> 24:39.436
Officer Rydell suffers from
a neurosis that prohibits him
from performing his job.

24:39.502 --> 24:43.807
Doctor, would you read
the final paragraph
of your evaluation.

24:48.145 --> 24:50.447
"Officer Rydell's
irrational assumption...

24:50.513 --> 24:53.784
"that persons of color
are more likely to present
a physical threat...

24:53.851 --> 24:58.322
"makes him a hazard to himself,
his coworkers and the citizens
of the commonwealth.

24:58.389 --> 25:00.358
"Before recovery can begin,

25:00.424 --> 25:03.994
the subject must be
removed from the situation
that created the condition."

25:04.062 --> 25:06.564
Thank you, Doctor.
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Doctor.</i>

25:06.630 --> 25:09.467
In your report, you use
this word "irrational."

25:09.533 --> 25:11.569
That have a special
psychiatric meaning?

25:11.635 --> 25:14.472
It means that
the patient responds...

25:14.538 --> 25:16.841
inappropriately
to real-world conditions.

25:16.908 --> 25:20.078
<i>If a child was punished</i>
<i>by his parents in a garage,</i>
<i>for example,</i>

25:20.144 --> 25:22.747
he may have an irrational
fear of cars.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.883
What if it's rational...

25:24.949 --> 25:27.686
to believe he has more danger
coming from a person of color?

25:27.752 --> 25:31.190
If that's the lesson learned
from years on the street,
the voice of experience--

25:31.256 --> 25:36.128
Then I feel the Boston Police
Department has a serious
institutional problem.

25:37.696 --> 25:39.765
I'd like to quote someone
who's not an officer.

25:39.832 --> 25:41.767
A man of color, in fact.

25:41.834 --> 25:47.773
Reverend Jesse Jackson,
uh, <i>Wall Street Journal,</i>
December 17, 1993.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.975
[ Clears Throat ]

25:50.042 --> 25:53.546
"There is nothing
more painful to me
at this stage in my life...

25:53.613 --> 25:57.917
"than to walk down the street
and hear footsteps and start
thinking about robbery,

25:57.984 --> 26:00.820
then look around
and see someone white
and feel relieved."

26:02.322 --> 26:05.959
Would that statement
make Jesse Jackson
irrational or prejudiced?

26:06.026 --> 26:08.662
I never treated Jesse Jackson.

26:08.729 --> 26:11.097
<i>I would say, however,</i>

26:11.164 --> 26:16.236
an idea can be widely held
and still constitute
a psychiatric condition.

26:16.303 --> 26:19.072
I take issue
with the suggestion
that Mr. Rydell's ideas...

26:19.139 --> 26:23.244
are widely held
by the Boston Police Department.

26:23.310 --> 26:26.180
And I take issue with
your automatic rejection
of that suggestion.

26:26.247 --> 26:31.018
<i>The issue is</i>
<i>whether Officer Rydell has</i>
<i>a diagnosable condition...</i>

26:31.085 --> 26:33.287
and whether that condition
is job-related.

26:33.354 --> 26:36.157
So let's keep the debate
right there, shall we?

26:39.126 --> 26:42.096
<i>[ Door Opens ]</i>
I think we got a shot.
I really do.

26:42.163 --> 26:44.199
With that panel?
Don't hold your breath.

26:44.266 --> 26:46.401
That Adams guy

26:53.775 --> 26:55.844
Don't judge me, Rebecca.

26:55.911 --> 26:58.647
I'm judging your client.
I'm not defending the man.

26:58.714 --> 27:02.150
I'm representing the idea
that racism could be a sickness
in that department.

27:02.217 --> 27:06.088
Now, how many times have you
been pulled over because your
license plate light was out?

27:06.154 --> 27:10.158
Too many. And you were yanked
out and beaten once for fitting
a general description, remember?

27:10.226 --> 27:12.928
This isn't about that.
Maybe not.

27:12.995 --> 27:15.264
But the idea
that the cop who did that...

27:15.331 --> 27:18.634
could get disability pay
and an early pension...

27:18.701 --> 27:20.703
makes me a little sick.

27:28.812 --> 27:30.747
Would you please stop this.

27:30.814 --> 27:32.882
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:32.949 --> 27:37.120
Look. You know,
I know it was just a dream.

27:37.187 --> 27:39.189
I-- I know this.

27:39.256 --> 27:41.191
But, uh--

Well, the first time
I ever hit a home run
in Little League,

27:44.061 --> 27:46.163
I had a dream about it
the night before.

27:46.230 --> 27:48.966
Sometimes my dreams
can be like omens.

Are you mulling it over?

28:02.647 --> 28:04.649
Jimmy,

28:04.715 --> 28:08.186
since we work together,
I don't think
it would be a good idea.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.788
We should keep things
completely professional.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.591
Yeah.
You're probably right.

28:13.658 --> 28:16.828
Well--
Yeah, you're right.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.971
Can I ask you one thing?
Sure.

Um--
[ Stammers ]

28:31.410 --> 28:34.346
I don't really
remember my dreams.
And, uh,

28:34.413 --> 28:40.119
I suspect, knowing myself,
I'd probably try to keep
my dreams professional too.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.488
Yeah. Well--

28:42.554 --> 28:45.257
Anyway, I thought I'd ask.

28:46.526 --> 28:48.327
You're a very supple person.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.898
Thank you.

a medication, why wouldn't he
just swallow the pills?

<i>and mix them with wine?</i>

29:02.509 --> 29:04.644

So,

29:04.711 --> 29:07.948
after your husband
took the poison
and became unconscious,

29:08.015 --> 29:10.017
did you and Mr. Forsythe
carry him to the bathroom,

29:10.083 --> 29:12.319

and put him in the bathtub?

29:15.188 --> 29:17.758
<i>I have one last question.</i>

29:17.825 --> 29:22.263
When the police informed you
that your husband of 12 years
was dead, did you cry?

29:22.330 --> 29:24.298
I--

29:25.533 --> 29:28.202
I think I was in shock.

29:28.269 --> 29:30.671

You didn't cry, did you?

29:30.738 --> 29:33.141
Not when the police
were there maybe.

29:33.207 --> 29:37.078
But after they left, I did.
When it looked like
you were going to get caught.

- Did you ask the police
how he died?

29:41.249 --> 29:43.184
Of course I did.

Okay.

accept that...

30:22.492 --> 30:25.829

three days before your husband's
death, did you not?

<i>I met with him a lot.</i>

he discussed the terms
of the prenup, didn't he?

- <i>[ Mary Jane ] Yes.</i>
- <i>[ Bobby ] And those terms</i>
<i>were unfavorable,</i>

If we start
accusing each other,

have to pick one or the other,
and they couldn't possibly.

You did it. She did it.
Both did it. Neither did it.

doubt. What I did in there
was desperate. I know.

What's to stop any

post-traumatic stress disorder?

were a disorder,
