WEBVTT

00:11.720 --> 00:14.211
Okay, I've got
a triple-shot, mocha,
cirillium latte,

00:14.306 --> 00:16.171
an extra hot,
chromium kona macchiato

00:16.266 --> 00:18.803
and a double-distilled
Peruvian slow roast.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.597
Okay,
I'm telling you it's weird.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.393
This is America's
favorite pastime.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.517
Please, a bunch
of grown men slapping
each other on the butt

00:24.608 --> 00:25.939
and hitting balls
with sticks.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.563
You want to talk weird?
Let's talk about
what you're wearing.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.190
You choose now
to mock my clothes?

00:30.280 --> 00:31.440
I call it
like I see it.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.193
There's nothing wrong
with this dress.

00:33.242 --> 00:36.530
The fact that you call
a tank top with a belt
a dress,

00:36.620 --> 00:37.985
all the wrong I need.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.029
Well, you know,
it's not like I'm wearing
a thong under it.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.538
(STAMMERING)
No, no.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.323
How old are you?
Old enough to know
that that

00:43.377 --> 00:44.708
is the last thing
I want to hear

00:44.753 --> 00:46.118
my 15-year-old
daughter saying.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.373
Thong.
Dont

00:47.422 --> 00:49.037
Thong. Thong!

00:52.636 --> 00:55.969
Hey! Hey.
Eyes front, eyes front.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.637
There you go.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.346
Hey, Vincent,
I heard something about
a town meeting

01:01.395 --> 01:03.807
somewhere this morning?
Do you know where or when?

01:03.897 --> 01:07.060
Oh. Here and now.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.186
(BEEPING)

01:18.078 --> 01:20.945
HENRY: Good morning, Eureka!

01:21.039 --> 01:23.246
And here '3 the
Monday Morning Minute.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.783
After much discussion,
we are installing
our ﬁrst trafﬁc light

01:25.877 --> 01:28.414
on the corner
of Main and Archimedes.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.666
Also, we ’/I be holding
special elections

01:30.757 --> 01:32.668
next month
for our new town mayor.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.172
All interested candidates
please contact Allison Blake.

01:36.305 --> 01:39.638
And ﬁnally, today,
one of our newest citizens,
former US Marsha/l,

01:39.725 --> 01:41.431
Sheriff Jack Carter.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.510
Would you like to say
a few words, Sheriff Carter?

01:45.272 --> 01:50.357
Oh, okay. Like he said,
I'm Jack Carter

01:51.486 --> 01:52.692
and this is
my daughter Zoe.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.896
So, be nice.
Dad, stop talking. Now!

01:57.451 --> 01:59.658
It's nice to be here.

01:59.786 --> 02:03.153
Eureka is definitely unique.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.453
Hey, I was wondering
if anybody would
like to get together

02:07.544 --> 02:09.375
for, you know,
a pick-up baseball game?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.294
Or maybe a league?

02:11.340 --> 02:12.500
You know, something
very low-key,

02:12.591 --> 02:14.582
just, you know, hang out
and get to know each other.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.626
HENRY: Yeah,
our minute '3 just about up,
Sheriff.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.088
Oh, okay.
Well, if anybody's
interested...

02:18.138 --> 02:21.505
So, to recap,
trafﬁc signal,
mayor’s election,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.807
Sheriff Carter, baseball.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.885
Have a great week, folks!

02:38.700 --> 02:40.315
Baseball league.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.905
| just want to
put him in my pocket.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.952
Be nice, Nathan.
He's just trying
to fit in.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.408
Yeah, well,
don't hold your breath.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.209
Speaking of which,
what's going on with
the anti-missile shield array?

02:51.004 --> 02:53.495
I've got two teams
working on it
around the clock.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.831
I'll have your prototype
by Friday.
Good.

02:55.926 --> 02:59.214
The Department of Defense
has invested a lot of money
in that project, Nathan.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.511
They want to
see returns, soon.

03:01.973 --> 03:02.962
Do they?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.927
Just a friendly
word of advice.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.179
So, we're friends now?

03:07.229 --> 03:10.096
Well, I guess that's a step
in the right direction.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.356
All right,
don't get too excited.

03:13.652 --> 03:17.190
I'm not running out
to renew our wedding vows
or anything.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.861
Look, Allison, l was thinking,
maybe we should...

03:21.910 --> 03:26.700
So, Kevin's been doing
much better since he
started the new drug trial.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.826
Good. That's good.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.419
He had a very positive
session this morning.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.459
He's very calm, focused.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.664
He doesn't seem to be
having any side effects
from the methyl...

03:36.717 --> 03:38.457
Methylphenidate
hydrochloride.

03:38.552 --> 03:42.340
It's a mouthful,
but it may be the first step
to finding a cure to autism.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.345
So, Kevin is definitely
on the drug.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.349
Allison, even it! knew,
I couldn't tell you.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.853
It's a double-blind study.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.557
If I told you, it would skew
the results,
invalidate the trial.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.890
I know. It's just that
lately he's seemed more...

03:56.069 --> 03:59.277
I don't know, focused,
connected to me,
if that makes any sense.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.943
Well, that's what
we were hoping for.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.148
Great.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.527
Then you'll keep me
in the loop
on the shield array?

04:07.706 --> 04:09.571
Consider yourself kept.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.081
(BELL RINGING)

04:22.053 --> 04:24.715
Have a good day at school.
You know, try not to
commit any felonies.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.721
(SCOFFING)
Good pep talk, dad.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.266
JO ON RADIO:
Lupo for Carter. Over.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.566
Yeah, go ahead, Jo.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.978
Nice speech.
Baseball's huge here. Over.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.608
Do you need something?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.739
I’ve got a hit and run
off Coriolis Loop.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.901
You need to see this.
Over.
Copy.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.622
Perfect.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.332
(HONKING HORN)

04:54.795 --> 04:56.535
(BELL RINGING)

04:59.716 --> 05:01.047
Hey, Jo. What you got?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.170
Hit and run.
She says they came
out of nowhere.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.671
You get a description
of the other vehicle?

05:04.763 --> 05:06.799
Well, that's just it,
there is no other vehicle.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.677
Whatever hit her
was on foot and,
according to her, invisible.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.099
Did you give her
a sobriety test?

05:11.144 --> 05:13.635
Yeah, she's clean.
But check this out.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.479
Wow!

05:16.650 --> 05:18.766
So, what do you
think hit her?

05:20.737 --> 05:23.149
Well, whatever it was,
it went that way.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.451
You get bears
around here?
Heck, yeah.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.213
I've never seen a bear
do anything like that.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.261
Well, what else
could it be?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.928
Gigantopithecus Americanus.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.975
(EXCLAIMING) Taggart,
what the hell?

05:55.021 --> 05:56.010
(SHUSHING)

05:57.023 --> 05:58.684
It could still
be out there.
What?

05:58.775 --> 06:03.360
Note the large stride,
trail of destruction,

06:04.030 --> 06:06.021
the extended footprint.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.232
Tell me you
don't mean Bigfoot.

06:10.662 --> 06:15.076
I mean
Gigantopithecus Americanus.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.616
Let's give him
a sobriety test.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.542
How'd you get here
so fast?

06:19.629 --> 06:21.494
Heard you on my scanner.

06:21.923 --> 06:25.882
And what, you were just
passing by in full cammies
and night-vision goggles?

06:25.927 --> 06:27.337
Yeah.

06:28.930 --> 06:29.919
Nice.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.560
Hey, guys.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.977
Think we found
our hit and run.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.033
Is that a body?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.488
Not anymore.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.121
He's saving
the rest for later.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.953
That's how they feed.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.279
I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.456
l have. It's never pretty.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.999
Would you stop
with the Bigfoot?
This is serious.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.294
I take Bigfoot
very seriously.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.793
There's no way
an animal did this,
real or imaginary.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.465
Carter's right.
I mean, look,
these are friction burns,

07:49.511 --> 07:51.251
those are
impact wounds.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.590
He's probably broken
every bone in his body.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.131
It's like he fell out
of an airplane.
Yeah, only horizontally.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.469
HENRY: Exactly.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.346
Okay. So we know
this isn't an animal attack.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.688
If you buy that hypothesis.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.979
Yeah,
I'm going out on a limb.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.060
Henry, what is this?

08:06.820 --> 08:10.813
That is a subcutaneous
computer chip,
probably biometric.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.155
I'm sorry?

08:13.201 --> 08:15.112
Oh, a genetically
encoded marker,

08:15.161 --> 08:18.153
usually used for tracking
or identification.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.535
Yeah, like I used
on the black Rhino
in the African bush.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.158
Yeah, just like that.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.118
Only, this is a little bit
more sophisticated

08:25.171 --> 08:27.548
than what you would find
on the open market.
Which means...

08:27.632 --> 08:30.089
That this guy is either
a researcher at
Global Dynamics...

08:30.176 --> 08:31.507
Or the research.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.583
I'll call Stark.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.136
No, hold on.
I've got a better idea.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.928
Hey, Spencer,
get my pen.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.554
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

08:40.854 --> 08:41.843
Allison Blake.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.354
Hey, Allison, it's Carter.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.680
I need a favor.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.517
I thought you'd never ask.
Listen, I want to play
first base.

08:48.611 --> 08:49.942
They're always putting me
in right field.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.362
Well, actually,
that's not why I'm calling.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.396
Oh.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.240
There's been an accident
and it might be connected
with Global Dynamics.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.612
We found a subcutaneous
computer chip

08:57.704 --> 08:59.865
in the man's ribs
and I need you to source it.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.789
Don’t let anyone know,
we 're trying to do this
as quiet as we can.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.036
Got it.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.671
(SIGHING)

09:18.391 --> 09:20.052
You comfortable, Fargo?

09:20.143 --> 09:22.225
Can I offer you a beverage?

09:24.147 --> 09:26.103
I haven't slept in days.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.723
My team just can't keep up.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.900
Milton's team is full
of Section Five guys.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.402
They have better materials,
unlimited resources,

09:33.448 --> 09:36.155
not to mention 160 le.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.403
Competition
breeds excellence.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.443
It brings out
the best in us.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.449
Yeah, tell that
to Nancy Kerrigan.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.280
You ever want to be
considered for Section Five,

09:44.375 --> 09:46.502
you've got to be able
to compete on their level.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.746
Talent

09:48.088 --> 09:50.079
will only get you so far.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.299
It comes down to attitude.
Yeah,
I got plenty of attitude,

09:55.678 --> 09:59.170
but what I don't have
is a hyper-velocity,
anti-missile shield array

09:59.265 --> 10:01.551
for the Pentagon test
on Friday.

10:02.894 --> 10:05.180
Yeah, but at least
I'm punctual.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.975
Milton's not late yet.

10:15.478 --> 10:19.119
Hey, Dr. Hauke.
Aren't you going
to be late for work?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.905
I've got plenty of time.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.616
Well, in that case,
let me top you...

10:35.802 --> 10:37.963
Dr. Hauke,

10:39.305 --> 10:41.842
right on time.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.970
Okay, gentlemen.
Change of plans.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.723
The team that can deliver
a working prototype

10:51.818 --> 10:54.685
by tomorrow at 5:00
gets the funding.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.064
But you said Friday.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.614
By tomorrow we'll have it
in a variety of colors
for you, Dr. Stark.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.071
See what I mean, Fargo?
Attitude.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.240
Okay, guys,
our deadline is now tomorrow.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.622
So we need to step it up,
we need to get serious,

11:12.088 --> 11:14.750
but mostly we need to cheat.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.970
Twice in one day.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.179
I'm starting to think
you miss me.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.932
I think it's you
who's missing someone.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.017
I'm betting the
computer chip means...

11:32.066 --> 11:33.055
(SHUSHING)

11:36.946 --> 11:38.527
Nothing.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.030
I'm betting
the computer chip
means this guy

11:41.075 --> 11:43.202
was working
on something classified.

11:44.495 --> 11:47.658
CARTER: I don't know
what's going on, but my gut
tells me it's bad.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.574
His guts should have
told you that.

11:50.668 --> 11:54.081
Well, let's hope
the autopsy can get us
something concrete.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.218
I want everything
packed up and moved back
to Global Dynamics.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.394
Hey. Hey!

12:11.481 --> 12:13.392
It's a crime scene!
Don't touch anything.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.056
Jo, you want
to tend to this?

12:15.109 --> 12:17.270
I appreciate
your efforts, Sheriff,

12:17.362 --> 12:18.898
but this is a little
above your pay grade,

12:18.947 --> 12:22.940
which I assume you knew
since you called Allison
before you called me.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.361
You are so stuck
in right field.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.947
I had to tell him, Carter.
We have strict
protocols about this.

12:27.038 --> 12:29.654
You're interfering
in a criminal investigation,
and I'm the law.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.582
This man worked
in Section Five,
where I'm the law.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.959
NATHAN: So, unless you have
hard evidence of a crime,

12:35.046 --> 12:37.753
you can stop what
you're doing. Henry!

12:37.799 --> 12:38.959
Deep, deep right.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.586
Just consider me Switzerland.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.751
You know,
just here packing up.

12:42.804 --> 12:46.137
I respect the job
you do Sheriff, I do.
ltjust ends here.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.761
Oh, I'm just
getting started.
Be prudent, Sheriff.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.346
I wouldn't want you
to end up in a federal prison.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.846
Yeah, well, lwouldn't
want you to end up

12:51.938 --> 12:54.224
with my foot
shoved up your ass.
Carter!

12:54.274 --> 12:55.605
Sheriff, we're grown men.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.936
I'd like to think
we're a little more
evolved than that.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.439
Oh, you overestimate me.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.437
Touche'.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.866
JO: It's out of your hands.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.449
There's got to be
something we can do.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.288
Stark's head honcho
up at Global Dynamics.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.587
When he says, "Jump,"
everyone else says,
"W hat trajectory?"

13:19.632 --> 13:22.465
Yeah, well.
I say, "Screw him."

13:22.677 --> 13:26.261
Well, he's probably saying
the same thing about you,
only in Latin.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.967
You saw the body, right?

13:28.057 --> 13:30.548
I mean, there's no accident.
I'm not giving up on this.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.929
Unless we can show
evidence of a crime,

13:33.187 --> 13:34.563
you don't have
much of a choice.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.729
I can't show evidence
of anything,
Stark took it all.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.431
Not all of it.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.308
That's a pen.

13:40.361 --> 13:43.319
No, it's a portable
magnetic resonance imager.

13:43.364 --> 13:47.107
| just did a quick scan,
while everybody else
was distracted.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.244
We may not have a body,
but with a little patience

13:51.331 --> 13:55.665
we are gonna have
a darn good three-dimensional
representation.

13:57.587 --> 13:58.576
(CLICKING)

13:59.672 --> 14:00.661
(WHISTLING)

14:04.218 --> 14:05.833
(BEEPING)

14:07.972 --> 14:09.837
(LAUGHING)

14:10.350 --> 14:12.636
Henry, I could kiss you.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.848
But, why don't we
move this to Jo's desk?

14:15.897 --> 14:18.309
I'm running
a reconstructive algorithm,

14:18.649 --> 14:20.605
just to sort of
fill in the gaps.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.354
How long before
we get a full image?

14:22.403 --> 14:25.065
A few hours, maybe less.
Once I get it back
to the garage,

14:25.156 --> 14:27.397
I can boost
the processing power.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.860
Okay.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.991
In the meantime,
Jo and I
will try to figure out

14:31.037 --> 14:32.652
how this guy got this way.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.411
Where we going?
Back to the woods.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.081
Odds are Stark's
goons missed something.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.095
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Access to Section Five
granted.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.306
Dr. Hauke,

15:02.235 --> 15:04.317
a word?

15:05.780 --> 15:08.237
Just a few
finishing touches,
Dr. Stark,

15:08.324 --> 15:11.782
and it should be ready
for test phase.
Good.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.526
Good.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.574
And your team,
everyone pulling
their weight?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.492
I didn't
want to say anything,
but Dr. Hawthorne

15:21.587 --> 15:24.044
wasn't up to the task,
so I sent him home.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.085
VVhen?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.249
Yesterday.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.709
VVhy?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.422
Well, there's been
an accident.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.435
Hawthorne.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.602
Is there anything else
I should know, Milton?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.810
Only that, in spite
of his shortcomings,

15:43.901 --> 15:45.437
you're going to have
a highly sophisticated,

15:45.486 --> 15:47.898
anti-missile
prototype to test tomorrow.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.074
A man died, Milton.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.279
l have bigger concerns
at the moment.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.955
So big you want us
to stop working?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.826
I'll keep you apprised.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.753
Keep up the good work.

16:13.764 --> 16:17.131
What was that about?
Nothing,
just get back to work.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.968
lt's Hawthorne?
Something happen?

16:26.819 --> 16:29.276
We need to make
every second count.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.571
What?

16:33.242 --> 16:35.654
It's just enough to get us
through the night.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.489
I don't know.
These side effects...

16:37.580 --> 16:38.945
Something's not right
with this stuff.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.159
One more dose
isn't gonna kill you, Keller.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.666
Not taking it
might kill your career.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.451
It's your call.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.887
MIL TON:
Okay, let's get back to work.

17:06.609 --> 17:07.598
No, come on.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.531
Bingo.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.537
(BELL RINGING)

17:19.622 --> 17:22.659
Which basically means

extremely sensitive

17:24.544 --> 17:26.500
Exhibits a phenomenon
known as chaos.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.662
Come on, Courtney,
that's a textbook definition.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.796
You've got to state
specific examples.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.212
Open your eyes, meat.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.055
Sorry, it was an accident.

17:40.101 --> 17:43.093
You're not going to screw
with my dad's credit scores
again, are you?

17:43.187 --> 17:45.894
Lucky for you,
I'm in a forgiving mood.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.223
Good God, it's Nerd-vana.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.354
You have no idea.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.982
I don't know.
You look fairly normal.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.189
Well, everyone's
got their way
of standing out,

17:56.242 --> 17:58.654
like yelling "thong"
in a crowded restaurant.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.733
Too much?

17:59.787 --> 18:01.652
It got my attention.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.784
Yeah, well, thongs
get everyone's attention.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.665
l'm Dylan.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.831
Yeah, I know.
The Monday Minute.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.207
You did see that?

18:11.257 --> 18:13.964
Don't worry, I know
exactly how you feel.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.922
It's a drag
when people judge you
by what your parents do.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.969
Your dad's
a total loser, too?

18:19.056 --> 18:21.433
Actually,
he's a Nobel laureate
in chemistry.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.975
Mom's a physicist.
Compared to them,
I'm the loser

18:25.062 --> 18:26.927
and I got a 4.6 GPA.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.981
Well, that sucks.
Yeah, that's
growing up in Eureka.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.691
So, I guess you're one
of the brainiacs, huh?

18:33.946 --> 18:36.938
Well, I do have
an internship
at Global Dynamics.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.607
I hope that doesn't
color your opinion
of me.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.945
Depends.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.655
On?

18:43.039 --> 18:45.781
Whether or not you
let me cheat off you
in class.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.142
Hey, Jo, do you have a knife?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.068
Ask a stupid question...

19:33.047 --> 19:34.537
JO: Is that an ear?

19:34.799 --> 19:36.005
Yeah.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.092
There's our evidence.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.481
Oh, hey, Henry.
How's it going?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.366
Fire in the hole!

20:06.205 --> 20:07.194
(EXCLAIMS)

20:08.999 --> 20:11.285
Jack, I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you come in.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.208
I can't hear anything.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.500
Henry, what are you doing?

20:21.554 --> 20:22.794
Working on a hunch.

20:22.888 --> 20:26.972
A hypothesis
on how our guy died

20:27.059 --> 20:28.890
and it wasn't any Bigfoot.

20:28.936 --> 20:32.645
Yeah, well, tell me
something I don't know.
Okay, he tripped.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.183
He tripped
and was hit by the car?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.973
No, he hit the car.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.692
What, was he going like
500 miles an hour?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.148
588 miles and hour,

20:40.239 --> 20:41.740
and he glanced off it,
which would explain

20:41.824 --> 20:44.531
why the car spun out
instead of being smashed
on impact.

20:44.577 --> 20:48.161
Yeah, I think I like
the Bigfoot theory again.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.329
Here, look,
I've done numerous
simulations.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.156
I've done
mechanical augmentation,

20:52.251 --> 20:53.661
I've done temporal
manipulation,

20:53.753 --> 20:56.165
I've done
biological enhancement.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.496
Only one theory
makes sense.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.999
Someone or something
turned our guy
into roadrunner.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.468
Okay, ifthat something
was a chemical...

21:08.559 --> 21:12.347
Okay.
...that you could ingest,
could you test for it?

21:12.438 --> 21:14.269
Sure, it! had a body.

21:17.902 --> 21:20.234
How about a body part?
Oh, that's very good.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.610
Very good.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.983
Why does it look like me?

21:27.077 --> 21:28.578
HENRY: lt's generic!

21:37.421 --> 21:39.628

(PANTING)

21:46.472 --> 21:47.461

21:55.481 --> 21:58.348
Henry, do you ever
actually work on cars?

21:58.484 --> 22:01.851
Sometimes,
when it gets slow, yeah.
Here, look, check this out.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.902
See how when l
probe the tissue,

22:03.989 --> 22:06.981
how the ADP/ATP ratio
is out of equilibrium?

22:07.076 --> 22:08.156
First thing I noticed.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.909
Not only that,
this guy has highly
elevated levels of

22:10.996 --> 22:13.612
cyclopentano-
perhydrophenanthrene.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.074
He's been juicing!

22:16.168 --> 22:17.669
With what? Like, rocket fuel?

22:17.711 --> 22:20.373
I don't know,
but you won't find it
in Barry Bonds' locker.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.622
Could you find
this in Section Five?

22:22.675 --> 22:25.337
Maybe. I'll know more
once I isolate the compound.

22:27.263 --> 22:28.548
Um...

22:29.682 --> 22:31.422
Okay, okay.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.304
Let's say someone,
literally, is speed-freaking.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.061
What signs would I look for?

22:37.147 --> 22:39.103
Besides running at
600 miles an hour?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.692
Appetite, extreme thirst.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.142
Any drug that would increase
the metabolic rate this much

22:43.195 --> 22:46.938
requires massive amounts
of electrolytes, simple
and complex carbohydrates.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.943
Henry, you're a rock star.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.444
Can I borrow
your wonder-pen?

22:50.536 --> 22:51.776
Sure, where you going?

22:51.871 --> 22:53.361
To grab a little lunch.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.538
ALLISON: So, I thought you
were mad at me.

22:56.584 --> 22:59.041
If I was, would I
be taking you out to lunch?
Here?

23:00.170 --> 23:01.876
Well, maybe I'm
a little mad at you, yeah.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.420
Okay, what is
this about, Carter?

23:03.507 --> 23:04.496
Nothing.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.961
You know,
we just never hang out.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.428
I mean, what's
going on with you?

23:08.512 --> 23:10.548
You know, what's going on
with Allison?

23:10.639 --> 23:13.096
Okay, for a cop,
you're a bad liar.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.726
I'm afraid there
may be drugs involved
with our John Doe's death.

23:18.314 --> 23:19.474
What kind of drugs?

23:19.565 --> 23:21.806
The kind that
can make you run
at Mach five.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.062
Are you sure you're
not on drugs?
Yes.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.610
Look for someone
eating a massive
amount of food.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.813
So we're looking
for someone who's hungry?
Yeah.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.982
In a cafeteria, at lunch?

23:32.411 --> 23:34.652
Look, I'm not
talking about a regular
amount of hungry,

23:34.747 --> 23:38.160
I'm talking like
post-super—speedy-
drug-binge hungry.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.745
You think Global Dynamics
has a drug problem?

23:40.836 --> 23:43.748
I think l have
a dead researcher
who was juicing on something.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.880
I mean, athletesjuice, right?

23:47.343 --> 23:48.879
Why not scientists?

24:00.481 --> 24:03.348
Speaking of which,
no cafeteria food's that good.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.479
Wait, wait, look,
those guys are
from Section Five.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.107
This has to be
handled delicately.

24:09.156 --> 24:12.319
Trust me. Trust.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.783
Hey, guys, I hate
to interrupt your lunch,

24:18.874 --> 24:21.365
but I was wondering if you
could help me with something?

24:25.965 --> 24:29.457
I want to know what drug
this guy was on and which
one of you killed him.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.507
You son of a bitch.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.007
Is that delicate
enough for you?

24:43.857 --> 24:48.066
Sheriff, I'm really
starting to tire of this.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.894
Well, then,
I'll make it easy on you.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.650
Have these guys
submit to a drug test.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.152
Do you have
evidence that they're
taking something illegal?

24:54.243 --> 24:57.735
Well, illegal, no.
But that body was pumped
with something from your lab,

24:57.830 --> 25:00.822
and whoever gave it
to him is looking at a
possible murder charge.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.458
Assuming that's true,
how do you know
anybody else is taking it?

25:05.045 --> 25:06.421
Well, I have my reasons.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.337
I'm listening.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.337
These guys

25:16.890 --> 25:19.632
are eating way too much.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.437
Your damning evidence
is a healthy appetite?

25:25.858 --> 25:27.940
Well, when you
put it like that, it
just sounds dumb.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.358
I know. Look, Sheriff,

25:29.445 --> 25:32.983
I'm gonna need something
a little more conclusive
than the munchies.

25:35.784 --> 25:36.773
(SONIC BOOM)

25:46.795 --> 25:48.786
Is that more what
you had in mind?

25:49.506 --> 25:52.043
I want them
quarantined and isolated
for investigation.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.048
This is still
an internal matter, Sheriff.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.756
Not anymore, Nathan.
Fargo took this
from Milton's team.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.257
Give it to me.
I'll have it analyzed.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.009
That's evidence
in an ongoing investigation.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.801
Carter is right.
Milton obviously knows
more than he's saying.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.431
I'll have Henry analyze this.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.228
We can interrogate
Milton's team tomorrow.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.185
Well, why not now?
I want to let them stew.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.397
Any drug that gets people
this cranked has got to have
a nasty rebound.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.900
All right, well, we can
put them in the
decontamination chamber

26:14.948 --> 26:17.690
in Section Four.
Perfect. Nice tie.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.868
I'm really starting
to dislike that guy.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.619
CARTER: No,
it's just been a long day.
SARAH, beer me.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.704
SARAH: Enjoy.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.748
I love this house.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.590
You know,
this workload is insane.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.258
I mean,
who needs this kind of
pressure?

26:37.304 --> 26:40.216
When do kids
just get to be kids?
Yeah, hard day at school?

26:41.100 --> 26:43.136
Actually, I made a friend.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.520
That's great!
What's her name?
His name

26:45.771 --> 26:47.102
is Dylan.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.723
Relax, he's perfectly
normal and smart.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.437
He even has
a student internship
at Global D.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.940
Since when do you
like guys who are
normal and smart?

26:55.072 --> 26:56.903
SARAH: There 's someone
at the door.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.485
Since they look like him.

27:02.454 --> 27:06.948
SARAH, we need to talk
about increasing security.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.793
Against burglars?

27:08.836 --> 27:10.292
Against boys.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.961
Wow, you guys live in a hole.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.831
I mean,
it's a nice hole, it's very...

27:16.218 --> 27:18.709
Very postmodern Armageddon.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.132
This is Dylan.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.717
From the cafe
this morning, right?

27:22.808 --> 27:25.641
Yeah, yeah. But I promise
my intentions are honorable.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.138
(CHUCKLES)

27:27.521 --> 27:29.307
It's not your intentions
I'm worried about.

27:29.356 --> 27:30.596
Dylan's my
chemistry tutor.

27:30.649 --> 27:31.684
Hmm.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.686
Just helping her
get a head start, you know?

27:33.777 --> 27:36.314
You need all the help
you can around here,
believe me.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.820
Famous parents,
overachiever, he has issues.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.363
Don't we all.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.992
Don't you have work to do?

27:44.496 --> 27:45.952
Yeah, I heard
about that accident.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.454
You figure out
what caused it yet?

27:49.126 --> 27:52.289
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
we're this close.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.829
Okay, great,
why don't you
get on that, okay?

27:54.882 --> 27:57.874
All right. I'm just gonna be
in the next room.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.171
l have a gun,
you know that right?

28:00.262 --> 28:01.843
Dad!Leave!
ltsloaded.

28:01.889 --> 28:03.299
I'm just saying,
I'm a pretty good shot.
Now!

28:04.516 --> 28:06.632
Hey, Henry. lt's Carter.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.891
Look, I think I got
what killed our guy.

28:08.979 --> 28:11.641
Still working on the who,
but I need
a chemical analysis.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.227
So give me a call
when you get in.

28:18.614 --> 28:19.694
(SIGHING)

28:34.213 --> 28:35.328
What was that?
Dad!

28:35.380 --> 28:36.415
Zoe, you okay?

28:36.506 --> 28:39.213
Yeah.
What was that?
A warning.

28:54.441 --> 28:57.854
They're all in
pretty bad shape.
I almost feel sorry for them.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.894
Well, he's almost ready.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.566
And, you're sure
they were here all night?

29:01.657 --> 29:03.522
Yeah, they've been
under constant surveillance.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.032
Well, someone trashed
my place last night.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.743
Someone moving too fast
for my security camera.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.997
If it wasn't one of them,
they definitely know
who it was.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.541
Maybe you should
question them at some point.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.247
Do | tell you
how to do yourjob?

29:16.296 --> 29:18.582
No, but that
is an amusing idea.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.665
l'll question them
when they're good and ready.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.214
Let me out of here.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.921
You can't keep me
locked up like this.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.426
Let me out!

29:31.395 --> 29:32.601
Like now.

29:50.372 --> 29:51.782
A tape recorder?

29:53.458 --> 29:55.119
This is priceless.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.120
This is how this is
gonna work, Milton.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.754
I'm not gonna
ask you misleading,
clever questions,

30:01.800 --> 30:04.212
not gonna try
to trap you, right?

30:04.636 --> 30:07.924
You work in Section Five,
I figure you're too smart
for that.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.338
Good.
Good.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.470
What is gonna happen

30:13.520 --> 30:16.307
is that I'm gonna sit
right out there

30:16.815 --> 30:20.148
and watch you slowly
go into withdrawal,

30:20.235 --> 30:23.978
until every nerve
in your body is on fire.

30:24.072 --> 30:27.360
Until your skin is crawling
and your brain is begging

30:27.451 --> 30:29.237
for whatever the hell
you took.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.656
You see, I got a body
pumped full of

30:31.747 --> 30:36.332
just God knows what
and everything points to you.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.496
ldidn't kill him
or anybody.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.919
Nice, yeah,
I need a different story.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.506
You got options Milton.

30:46.345 --> 30:50.179
You have options until
I head out that door.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.383
Okay.

30:57.647 --> 30:58.932
Good luck.

31:00.442 --> 31:01.648
Wait.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.361
We were just
trying to keep up.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.986
(STAMMERING)
I didn't know
anybody would get hurt.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.651
Who else is involved?
Nobody.

31:12.704 --> 31:13.910
Nobody.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.157
Somebody trashed my house

31:15.207 --> 31:16.947
trying to get me
to back off
from this investigation,

31:17.042 --> 31:19.749
and if you clowns were
in lock up...
Okay.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.710
But first,

31:23.673 --> 31:26.210
you got to know,
it wasn't my...

31:26.301 --> 31:28.963
It wasn't what?

31:29.096 --> 31:30.882
(MUMBLING VERY SLOWLY)

31:36.686 --> 31:38.893
Milton? Milton?

31:42.776 --> 31:44.312
It wasn't what?

31:46.071 --> 31:48.278
(CONTINUES MUMBLING FAINTLY)

32:01.628 --> 32:02.913
l was so close.

32:02.963 --> 32:05.170
It must be a reaction
to coming off the drug.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.669
His metabolism
is overcompensating,

32:07.759 --> 32:09.465
forcing his
nervous system
to shut down.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.293
Can you counteract it?

32:11.513 --> 32:14.129
Not without knowing
exactly what
he was taking.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.465
What did he say?
I don't know.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.936
But my assistant might.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.393
Don't ever call me that.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.354
Not you. Give me.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.437
(REWINDING)

32:31.616 --> 32:35.950
(SLOW MUMBLING)

32:37.038 --> 32:38.073
(SPEEDS UP)

32:38.123 --> 32:40.614
MIL TON: ...just used it
and SO did Hawthorne,

32:40.709 --> 32:42.700
SO you can't hold me
responsible for hiS death.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.375
Priceless, huh?

32:44.463 --> 32:48.172
MPH iS still experimental,
but with it altered
like that...

32:49.134 --> 32:51.341
But no one thought...
What's MPH?

32:51.428 --> 32:54.044
I think he's talking about
methylphenidate hydrochloride.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.800
It's an advanced
form of Ritalin.

32:55.891 --> 32:58.177
That's the drug
they're using on Kevin
in the study.

32:58.268 --> 33:00.133
They must have
altered it in the lab,

33:00.187 --> 33:01.768
changed the chemical
composition.

33:01.813 --> 33:02.893
Who has access to it?

33:02.981 --> 33:05.973
I can access
the personnel files,
but it will be a long list.

33:06.026 --> 33:10.235
Researchers, kids,
their parents, techs,
student interns.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.153
Now, hold it,
student interns?

33:12.532 --> 33:13.647
One of them named Dylan?

33:13.700 --> 33:14.689
(BEEPING)

33:14.784 --> 33:15.990
Yes.

33:16.119 --> 33:18.235
Dylan Hartwell,
he's a senior at Tesla.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.991
That's my
daughter's boyfriend.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.873
Son of a bitch
was hiding in plain sight.

33:23.293 --> 33:25.875
Okay, Jo,
you go to the kid's house,
I'm hitting the school.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.953
I'm on it.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.966
I can't believe
you did that.
Allison.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.877
You convinced me
to put Kevin in that study,

33:35.972 --> 33:38.133
now you've given him a drug
that has killed a man.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.640
The drug didn't kill him.
Cooking it in the lab did,

33:40.685 --> 33:42.266
and I didn't give
Kevin anything.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.594
Oh, great. So now
you're going to try

33:43.688 --> 33:44.803
to lay the blame
on someone else?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.598
No, I'm telling you
that Kevin isn't on the drug.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.686
What?

33:49.861 --> 33:52.728
He's not on MPH.
He's receiving the placebo.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.234
How could you know that?
It's a double-blind study.

33:55.325 --> 33:56.690
Because I cheated.

33:56.785 --> 33:59.902
Look, MPH is perfectly safe
when used properly,

33:59.996 --> 34:02.829
but with every new drug
there's side effects

34:02.874 --> 34:04.250
and until we knew more,
| just...

34:04.334 --> 34:05.540
I couldn't risk it.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.041
That can't...

34:07.671 --> 34:11.880
(STAMMERING) No,
he has been so different
since he started that trial.

34:11.967 --> 34:14.049
Because you're different.

34:15.011 --> 34:17.593
Any progress
that Kevin has made,

34:18.557 --> 34:22.220
it's because of his
relationship with you.
Not because of any drug.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.887
And, you've known
about this all this time?

34:27.399 --> 34:29.731
I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you. I...

34:31.653 --> 34:34.110
I just wanted
what was best for him.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.983
Don't lie to me again,

34:37.909 --> 34:41.868
but, thank you.

Hey. Where's Dylan?

35:08.565 --> 35:11.352
It was one kiss
during homeroom, relax.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.774
Okay, I'll freak out
about that later.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.817
Right now, I need to know
where Dylan is.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.608
Okay, I don't know,
I'm not his keeper.

35:17.699 --> 35:20.441
All right,
come with me, come on.
I'll bring a note tomorrow.

35:20.493 --> 35:21.949
I'm telling you
he's using drugs.

35:21.995 --> 35:24.702
You know, of course,
you think the guy I like
must be using drugs.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.700
He had access to the lab
and he was in our house

35:26.791 --> 35:28.042
last night
when it was trashed.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.458
What are you...
Dylan was right next to me
the whole time.

35:30.545 --> 35:34.129
This drug,
MPH, he cooks into speed,
literally.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.501
I mean,
it can make you move faster
than the eye can see.

35:36.593 --> 35:37.958
Do you realize
how crazy you sound?

35:38.011 --> 35:40.093
Nobody can move that fast.

just leave it alone?

35:58.156 --> 36:00.147
I told you to back off!

36:01.660 --> 36:03.616
You had to keep pushing.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.944
Everybody's always pushing,
all the time.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.157
Dylan, where's Zoe?

36:07.248 --> 36:08.533
You don't know
what it's like!

36:08.625 --> 36:11.332
I know what it's like
to be pulled from
a moving vehicle.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.670
Where's my daughter?

36:12.712 --> 36:15.454
I cooked the MPH
so that I could keep up!

36:15.840 --> 36:18.377
They came to me.
I wasn't dealing it!

36:18.468 --> 36:20.834
They said that
it! helped them,
that they would help me.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.843
They would help me
move up, you know.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.513
Now I'm gonna lose
my internship.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.512
Do you have any idea
how hard that I worked
for that?

36:28.603 --> 36:30.685
Dylan, you got to trust me.

36:30.772 --> 36:33.184
No, I told Hawthorne
to watch the dosage!

36:33.274 --> 36:35.981
Okay. So it's
an accident, right?

36:36.027 --> 36:37.688

from this

do anything else stupid,
more stupid.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.734
Don't call me stupid!

36:42.826 --> 36:44.407
You got to listen to me.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.184
I can't go to jail.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.023
It doesn't have to
end like this.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.903
I can't go to jail.
Dylan, don't!

37:22.949 --> 37:23.938
No!

37:24.033 --> 37:25.022
(GUN CLICKING)

37:26.828 --> 37:28.193
ZOE: Dylan!

37:47.849 --> 37:51.637
Two bits of advice,
always check the safety

37:51.936 --> 37:54.723
and never rush the mound
when the pitcher's
got the ball.

37:57.776 --> 37:58.891
Are you okay?

37:58.943 --> 38:00.023
Yeah, are you?

38:00.111 --> 38:02.978
Yeah, well,
better than your boyfriend.

38:03.239 --> 38:04.979
We are so broken up.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.204
Where's the car?

38:18.922 --> 38:20.628
This is Dr. Stark,

38:20.673 --> 38:23.540
I'd like a new project
given top priority.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.469
That's right.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.225
Okay, will you
lighten up, Carter?
This was your idea.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.347
Don't remind me.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.474
Look, I know it's not
the way you picked your bit,

38:37.524 --> 38:41.312
but the important thing is
people are making an effort.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.153
Really?
Is that what this is,
an effort?

38:46.032 --> 38:48.444
I call this an abomination.

38:53.081 --> 38:58.166
Well, it's a beautiful day
here at Quantum Field.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.876
HENRY:
Our very own Jack Carter.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.204
Jack Carter,
ladies and gentlemen.

39:02.298 --> 39:06.007
Let’s hear it for Jack Carter
as he steps up to the plate.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.798
Time to play ball!

39:14.227 --> 39:16.058
(WHOOPING) Dad! Come on!

39:18.147 --> 39:20.183
Batter, batter, batter.

39:20.275 --> 39:23.813
Crowd the plate, law dog.
I dare you.

39:23.862 --> 39:26.945
Just throw the damn ball,
dogcatcher.

39:28.157 --> 39:31.365
ZOE: Come on, dad!
This pitcher's got no game!

39:32.495 --> 39:34.360
Not gonna get you out!

39:35.290 --> 39:37.952
HENRY: Taggart iS looking
for hiS pitch.

39:40.003 --> 39:43.120
Oh, come on.
Finally he sees something
that he likes.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.622
WindS up for the pitch...

39:46.342 --> 39:47.422
(EXCLAIMING)

39:47.510 --> 39:49.717
He hitS the ball,
long fly to center.

39:49.804 --> 39:50.884
(EXCLAIMING)

39:56.477 --> 40:00.061
He caught it at the fence!

40:02.609 --> 40:05.191
It’s the ﬁrst big play
of the game!

40:05.236 --> 40:08.979
Now, that is what
I call baseball!

40:09.073 --> 40:10.574
(LAUGHING)

40:15.872 --> 40:18.329
Let a pro show you
how it's done.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.618
HENRY: Allison Blake
steps up to the plate.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.718
(HENRY LAUGHING)

40:32.764 --> 40:34.425
(CROWD CHEERING)

40:34.474 --> 40:37.807
And it iS creamed.

40:41.105 --> 40:42.436
This is going to be
a hell of a game.

40:42.482 --> 40:45.645
You know
what I'm talking about?
A hell of a game.

40:47.028 --> 40:49.314
I'll never get
used to this town.
