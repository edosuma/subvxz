No.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.157
You friends with Gary
who owns the dry cleaners?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.367
No.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.578
-Are you Jesus Christ?
-No.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.246
Oh, my God, you are!

09:39.413 --> 09:41.248
-You're Jesus Christ!
-No, I'm not.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.083
I'm just a guy working at a record store.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.501
Huh.

09:44.626 --> 09:45.836
Well, if you're not Jesus Christ,

09:45.919 --> 09:48.463
then you won't mind if I pee
on these Amy Grant CDs.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.382
-Don't!
-Aha! You are Jesus.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.092
(WEARILY) Yes. I am.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.344
Oh, my God! Jesus Christ!

09:54.428 --> 09:56.555
The messiah! You've returned!

09:56.722 --> 09:58.557
You've returned to bring us
the good word!

09:58.640 --> 09:59.641
What word?

09:59.725 --> 10:01.018
(SINGING)
A-well-a bird, bird, bird

10:01.101 --> 10:02.269
B-bird's the word

10:02.352 --> 10:04.521
A-well-a bird, bird, bird
B-bird's the word

10:04.605 --> 10:06.982
A-well-a bird, bird, bird

10:07.065 --> 10:09.318
A-well-a bird, bird, bird

10:09.401 --> 10:11.695
A-well-a bird, bird
B-bird's the word

10:16.658 --> 10:18.785
Jesus Christ has returned to Earth!

10:18.869 --> 10:21.038
I can't believe it!
The second coming!

10:21.121 --> 10:23.290
Will you keep it down?
It's not the second coming.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.125
Okay, so what are you doing here?

10:25.375 --> 10:28.754
Well, believe it or not,
I pop in every hundred years or so,

10:28.837 --> 10:31.173
kind of incognito,
just to get away from the family.

10:31.632 --> 10:32.925
Plus the timing seemed good,

10:33.008 --> 10:35.511
'cause my dad just quit smoking
and he's a little on edge.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.137
Who took my checkbook?

10:37.596 --> 10:38.722
Ellen?

10:39.097 --> 10:41.391
Why is there a pen cap and no pen?

10:41.892 --> 10:44.394
You're the first person
to recognize me in 2,000 years.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.979
Well, you seem like a nice guy.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.856
Hey, why don't you come over
to my house for dinner tonight?

10:47.940 --> 10:50.859
-Okay, but I don't get off till 7:00.
-Great. We'll have a blast.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.070
After we eat, we can watch
that YouTube footage

10:53.153 --> 10:54.988
of Marlee Matlin calling Moviefone.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.740
RECORDED MALE VOICE:
Please say the name of the movie

10:56.823 --> 10:58.617
you'd like to see now.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.452
(SLIGHTLY GARBLED) The Last Mimzy.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.579
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

11:02.663 --> 11:06.166
Please say the name of the movie
you'd like to see now.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.585
(SLOWLY) The Last Mimzy.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.963
You have selected 300!

11:11.046 --> 11:14.341
If this is the movie you'd like to see,
say yes now.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.592
No!

11:15.676 --> 11:18.303
You have confirmed 300!

11:22.432 --> 11:25.394
Wow, Jesus Christ at our dinner table.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.396
(LAUGHS) I still can't get over it.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.147
I'm actually glad you're all here tonight.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.234
I want to tell you that
one of you will betray me.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.486
(LAUGHS) Just kidding!

11:34.611 --> 11:37.739
Ah-ha-ha! He's doing that thing
he did in the storybook.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.450
So, Jesus, finish that
story you were telling us.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.618
Oh. All right, all right.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.246
So there I was,
they'd just beaten me senseless,

11:44.329 --> 11:47.165
stuck thorns in my head,
nailed me to a piece of wood,

11:47.249 --> 11:50.043
shoved a sponge full of vinegar
in my mouth and killed me.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.838
Then they put me in a hole
with a rock in front of it

11:52.921 --> 11:55.340
for two whole days,
and come Sunday, bam,

11:55.424 --> 11:56.717
I rise from the dead.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.720
Okay, that sounds like a nutty weekend,
but I can top it.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.931
So, me and Cleveland and Joe are just
wrecked on Southern Comfort, right?

12:03.015 --> 12:04.975
We know we're gonna puke, but Joe says,

12:05.058 --> 12:06.977
"Hey, let's go see Chronicles of Riddick."

12:07.060 --> 12:09.104
Sat through the whole thing
without puking,

12:09.188 --> 12:11.398
then I get home...
Wouldn't you know I lost my glasses.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.318
Huh? Peter one, Jesus zero.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.862
You know, Jesus,
if I go get my cell phone,

12:16.945 --> 12:19.198
would you mind talking to
my friend Muriel Goldman?

12:19.281 --> 12:21.617
I really just want to rub
her Jewish nose in this.

12:22.201 --> 12:23.535
All right, I'll be the one to say it.

12:23.619 --> 12:25.245
How do we know you're really Jesus?

12:25.454 --> 12:26.580
Can you perform miracles?

12:26.747 --> 12:28.665
Sure. How about this?

12:30.709 --> 12:32.503
Oh, boy! Sundaes!

12:32.586 --> 12:33.962
I love you, Jesus!

12:34.046 --> 12:35.589
(CHUCKLES) I love you, too, fella.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.382
Hey, Jesus, can you do something for me?

12:37.466 --> 12:38.592
Sure, Peter. What is it?

12:38.884 --> 12:40.427
(WHISPERS INAUDIBLY)

-(BUTTONS POPPING)

12:43.472 --> 12:44.598
(THUMP)

12:47.893 --> 12:48.894
Say, listen, Jesus,

12:48.977 --> 12:50.854
I know you're trying
to keep a low profile,

12:50.938 --> 12:53.732
but there's one person
I really want you to meet.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.025
Oh, Yeah? Who's that?

12:55.234 --> 12:58.028
The American people
may have turned against the war,

12:58.111 --> 13:00.030
but I answer to a higher power.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.866
I answer to the power of Jesus Christ.

13:02.950 --> 13:03.951
Oh, well, uh, that's funny,

13:04.034 --> 13:06.245
because I happen to have
Jesus Christ right here.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.913
I... I heard what you were saying.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.873
You know nothing of my work.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.751
How you ever got to be president
of anything is totally amazing.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.045
Boy, wouldn't it be great
if life were like this?

13:17.172 --> 13:18.924
Hey, listen, Jesus, thanks
for coming by tonight

13:19.007 --> 13:20.133
and hanging out with us.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.510
You may look like a bum,

13:21.593 --> 13:23.345
but you got a lot of talent, young man.

13:23.554 --> 13:26.431
Yeah, I'd forgotten how great it is
interacting with other people.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.393
Well, I better get some sleep.
I got to open the store tomorrow.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.436
Aw, you don't want to go
back to that record store.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.773
You got to get back out there,
coloring eggs and hiding 'em for kids.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.484
What, you mean... Reveal myself?

13:37.693 --> 13:40.028
Absolutely. This world needs you, Jesus.

13:40.571 --> 13:43.448
It needs you like a guy who
can't get it up needs a distraction.

13:44.783 --> 13:47.119
I am so ready to have sex with you.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.037
Oh, hey, is that my phone?

13:49.121 --> 13:50.247
I don't hear anything.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.456
Is that John Astin?

13:51.665 --> 13:53.208
I don't see anyone out there.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.919
Oh. Well, now there's so much going on.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.255
You know, you're right, Peter...
it may be time.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.673
But how do we do it?

14:00.048 --> 14:02.134
Everyone, may I have
your attention, please?

14:02.384 --> 14:05.053
I would like to introduce you
to the one, the only...

14:05.512 --> 14:06.722
Jesus Christ.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.225
That's right.
That's Jesus Christ right here.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.020
Jesus Christ.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.855
-Yeah, right.
-Look at these idiots.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.106
They're not even listening.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.400
You know what,
we got to prove it to 'em.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.652
Listen, I'm gonna go into that
supermarket and get some water,

14:20.736 --> 14:22.696
-and you're gonna turn it into wine.
-Okay, cool.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.823
Hey, can you get me a Cracked magazine?

14:25.282 --> 14:26.408
-Cracked?
-Yeah.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.536
Jesus Christ, unbelievable.
All right, I'll be back.

Wow, Jesus, can you believe
you're gonna get to meet Jay Leno?

15:02.819 --> 15:05.822
Mom, why is it that when Jesus
revealed himself to the world,

15:05.906 --> 15:07.866
he became famous,
and when I did it,

15:07.950 --> 15:09.743
I got suspended for five days?

15:09.952 --> 15:12.037
You know, I owe this all to you, Peter.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.705
You gave me the confidence I needed.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.249
Aw, never mind about that, pal.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.042
You just go out there
and knock 'em dead.

he's back on the scene.

So, Jesus, what've you been
doing since you've been back?

15:47.489 --> 15:49.366
Oh, you know,
just kind of bumming around,

15:49.449 --> 15:52.494

What's up! What's up!
Hey, you know what I hate?

16:45.339 --> 16:47.174
When you eat an ice cream cone
and it's all, like, cold,

16:47.299 --> 16:48.800
and you're, like... (GRUNTING)

16:48.884 --> 16:51.428
And you're, like, "Why didn't
you warn me that's so cold?"

16:51.512 --> 16:53.138
And he's, like, "It's ice cream, dude."

I can't believe Jesus
hasn't called me back.

I left him a message,
like, four hours ago.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.523
Well, maybe he doesn't
have his phone with him.

18:26.607 --> 18:29.318
No, no, it rang twice,
and then the voice mail picked up.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.028
If it had gone straight to voice mail,

18:31.111 --> 18:32.237
that means the phone was off.

18:32.321 --> 18:34.740
If it rang, like, six times,
that means he didn't hear it.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.492
But it rang twice, Lois...
That means the phone rang,

18:37.576 --> 18:39.453
he saw it was me,
and then he pressed a button

18:39.536 --> 18:41.079
and sent it straight to voice mail.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.332
You know what? Give me your phone.
I bet he'll pick up.

18:45.042 --> 18:46.752
Hey, hey, Lois!

18:46.835 --> 18:48.962
Hey, you, it's Peter. What the hell?

18:49.046 --> 18:50.172
We were supposed to do something today.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.590
Uh, I forgot to tell you,

18:51.673 --> 18:53.425
I have a doctor's appointment today.

18:53.509 --> 18:54.676
I'm actually there now.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.137
MAN: Hey, look...
Lindsay Lohan just took her top off!

18:57.221 --> 19:01.099
LOHAN: Hey, I just drank a beer!
Who wants to do me?

19:01.183 --> 19:02.392
MAN: I do!
MAN 2: Me, too!

19:02.476 --> 19:04.436
MAN 3: I just did you, but I'll go again!

19:04.520 --> 19:05.562
I got to go.

19:06.104 --> 19:08.023
Can you believe the way
Jesus is treating me?

19:08.315 --> 19:09.775
I thought he was my friend.

19:09.858 --> 19:13.153
Look, fame and success do
crazy things to people, Peter.

19:13.237 --> 19:16.323
I'm sure, deep down,
he's still the same old Jesus.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.784
He may just need to figure
that out in his own way.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.203
Maybe. But one thing's for sure, Lois...

19:21.578 --> 19:22.621
None of this would've happened

19:22.704 --> 19:25.916
if somebody hadn't stolen
my (BLEEP) "Surfin' Bird" record!

19:30.754 --> 19:31.797
Tonight's top story...

19:31.880 --> 19:33.799
Local record shop employee, Jesus Christ,

19:33.882 --> 19:36.385
was found in Mary Kate Olsen's
apartment this morning,

19:36.468 --> 19:37.970
face down and unconscious.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.597
Police revived and arrested
the disoriented Jesus,

19:40.681 --> 19:41.890
who was quoted as saying,

19:41.974 --> 19:44.726
"Jews are responsible
for all the world's wars."

19:45.269 --> 19:47.104
Brian, you think that's our Jesus?

19:47.187 --> 19:48.230
(PHONE RINGS)

19:48.313 --> 19:50.065
Griffin residence. Peter speaking.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.943
Oh, yeah? Why should I?

19:54.152 --> 19:55.904
Yeah? Well, get someone else
to bail you out,

19:55.988 --> 19:57.239
'cause it ain't gonna be me.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.284
Yeah? Well, what are
you gonna do about it?

20:01.618 --> 20:02.911
Ow! All right, I'm coming!

20:06.123 --> 20:07.875
Jesus Christ, look at you!

20:08.166 --> 20:09.168
You had it all...

20:09.251 --> 20:12.296
Money, fame, eternal life...
And you blew it!

20:12.379 --> 20:13.714
You let it all go to your head!

20:13.797 --> 20:15.132
I know, Peter.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.177
I guess it turns out
I'm just as human as anyone else.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.762
Yeah, well... What do we do now?

20:21.013 --> 20:22.181
You want the truth?

20:22.264 --> 20:24.183
I think it's time for me to go.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.851
This world's not ready for me yet,

20:25.934 --> 20:27.227
and I'm not ready for it.

20:27.603 --> 20:29.855
I don't know,
maybe I'll try coming back

20:29.938 --> 20:32.608
in another thousand years,
when I'm a little more mature.

20:32.691 --> 20:35.611
Well, that's a very mature
thing to say right there.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.321
I think you're on your way.

20:38.113 --> 20:41.950
Well, before I go, Peter,
there's something I want to give you.

20:42.201 --> 20:43.493
Hold out your hands.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.622
(HIGH-PITCHED ZAPPING)

20:50.626 --> 20:53.545
Well, I guess that's it, then.
Jesus is gone.

20:53.629 --> 20:55.506
I sure am gonna miss him.

20:55.589 --> 20:57.841
Me, too. Although he did give me something

20:57.925 --> 20:59.092
right before he disappeared.

20:59.343 --> 21:01.929
-What?
-Something very special, Lois.

21:02.012 --> 21:03.096
What is it, Dad?

21:03.180 --> 21:04.890
-What, you haven't heard?
-Crap!

21:04.973 --> 21:06.475

A-well-a bird, bird, bird

A-well-a bird, bird, bird
