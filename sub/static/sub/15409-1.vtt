03:47.300 --> 03:50.600
It's not like that. It's an exaggeration.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.900
He has just got a certain
success with the ladies.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.400
That's all.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.100
I'm not having it!

04:28.100 --> 04:30.400
Out! I can't have this!

04:30.600 --> 04:35.400
In my own house? I can't call it my own.
My own house! Out!

04:35.700 --> 04:38.500
I am a schoolteacher,
and I have to concentrate!

04:38.800 --> 04:39.800
Out!

04:40.200 --> 04:42.500
Need a steadying influence, that's what.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.500
That's what we need in this house,
a real steadying influence.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.200
A monk!

04:49.600 --> 04:52.800
There must be monks or
older men who are accountants...

04:53.200 --> 04:55.600
...poor old men in sexless professions.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.700
"Just come to London? Nowhere to stay?"

05:01.800 --> 05:05.300
And glad of it we are!
No trouble, us monks.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.900
Or some young lady, looking for
a clean home, in clean surroundings.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.100
Just watch where you're treading.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.100
-After kicks?
-Trampling eager.

05:30.300 --> 05:31.600
-For a fall.
-I'm bound.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.900
-It's all happening.
-lt'll end in tears.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.600
And no prince charming with a barrow.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.400
-Drugs.
-I'm bound to disappoint.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.300
-Pupils of her eyes.
-Look at her looking.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.100
I know what she wants,
and it isn't the YWCA.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.200
Hoping, that's what she's doing.
Hoping for being debauched.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.600
-Bound to end in tears.
-lnnocent eyes of blue.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.100
What her legs are walking her into.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.400
-London?
-Yes.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.300
Lovely.

07:24.700 --> 07:28.000
The guest book.
Please restrict your comment to one word.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.400
My chair!

07:36.400 --> 07:38.400
-My chair!
-My hair!

07:38.600 --> 07:40.300
What am I going to sit on?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.300
And there are gonna
be some changes made.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.200
What was that, Colin?

07:44.700 --> 07:48.300
Can you spare a moment, Tolen?
I don't mind about the chair.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.500
-I realize they've got to sit.
-My hair!

07:52.200 --> 07:54.900
-You what, Colin?
-Not now. I can't talk now.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Have you something to say, Colin?

07:57.500 --> 08:00.300
It was only a comment.
This is neither the time nor the place.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.700
-Got a woman yet, Colin?
-I knew you'd say that.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.400
Shut up.

08:04.700 --> 08:07.300
Shall I show you, Colin?
Shall I advise you?

08:07.500 --> 08:11.100
-Women like to be dominated.
-Keep your advice to yourself!

08:11.400 --> 08:12.700
Certainly.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.200
The motorcycle is, I consider,
their god, I find,

08:27.700 --> 08:30.800
-Is it?
-It's merely high spirits, really,

08:31.100 --> 08:33.299
-Merely?
-Every lane's a speedway,

08:33.400 --> 08:35.500
I blame the internal combustion,

08:35.700 --> 08:39.000
-They rule the streets,
-I'd rule them, Conscription,

08:39.200 --> 08:42.100
S he'll regret she didn't
wear a safety device.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.600
I feel for her chest, that's my feeling,

08:50.500 --> 08:53.200
-They've ruined the sea for me.
-I'm bound.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.800
Legs up, all up the road.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.700
-I'm bound by my age,
-Skirts up, showing all,

08:58.900 --> 09:00.100
-Where?
-Where?

09:00.300 --> 09:01.500
-Who?
-Where?

09:02.300 --> 09:05.400
Out all night and then
a windy ride on a motorbike.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.100
-I think not.
-That's no behavior.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.200
Out!

09:10.900 --> 09:14.500
Brown. You're all brown.
Look at your hall.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.300
-I had to make a start.
-Thank you. Out!

09:17.400 --> 09:21.400
Sick and tired of brown next to green.
I hate green.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.900
-You'll like it when it's done.
-lf I'd known you was a secret painter--

09:25.100 --> 09:26.100
When it's finished.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.700
-Was you leaving an address?
-For you?

09:29.200 --> 09:31.600
-I was not.
-No more men.

09:32.500 --> 09:36.000
Some young lady, looking for a clean home
with clean surroundings.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.400
Just come to London, nowhere to stay,
and glad of it they are,

09:40.600 --> 09:44.900
Of course, I haven't got a daughter,
Silent night, so it doesn't affect me,

09:45.100 --> 09:48.600
If you ask me,
they're a new brand of person altogether,,,

09:48.900 --> 09:50.900
,,,with their image they give,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.800
If that's all they can say
of the hand that suckled them,,,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.300
,,,I'm glad I'm on my last left leg,

10:00.800 --> 10:04.000
They're creeping back,
the streets are full of them,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.600
-The streets are full of them!
-I blame the army,

10:59.800 --> 11:02.600
-It's all strip and look big,
-What has the cartoon come to?

11:02.800 --> 11:06.600
They do make better soldiers for it,
Some blame the army, I don 't,

11:06.900 --> 11:08.100
Which army?

11:08.200 --> 11:11.600
National Service made a man of me,
taught me the value of the belly laugh,

11:11.900 --> 11:13.100
-I blame--
-Shut up,

11:13.100 --> 11:16.500
I blame the teachers, if you ask me,
That's my opinion,

11:17.200 --> 11:20.100
They have no conception,
the teachers, really, I think,

11:22.300 --> 11:25.100
It's all milk in the schools now, isn 't it?

11:25.300 --> 11:28.300
-I blame the National Health,
-I failed milk,

11:30.600 --> 11:34.200
They should have more tighter teachers,
who 've seen the world,

11:34.400 --> 11:36.500
I've seen many a foreign part,

11:38.700 --> 11:42.100
Throw out the milk
and bring back the belting, I advocate,

11:42.300 --> 11:44.000
That's what I froggle,

11:54.300 --> 11:55.600
Charlie!

11:55.800 --> 11:58.300
Come on up, Charles,
and give me the blackguard.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.700
The YWCA?

12:04.800 --> 12:06.000
-ls it?
-They're not in.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.100
-Windsor, are they?
-What?

12:08.800 --> 12:11.600
-Tart, is it?
-No, I'm looking for the YWCA.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.200
-The YW--
-Not here.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.200
We've never seen you before. Never.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.500
-He's been posted for his mother.
-Try the orderly room.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.300
-Are you dancing?
-S'cuse boots I am, darling.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.300
Haven't been west for a twelvemonth.
So, I'm going ginger.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.500
-Married, are you?
-No, I'm still young.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.900
Your best plan, I suggest,
is the orderly room.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.800
Only we're in our bearskins.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.200
The YWCA?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.600
Can't help you, love. I'm on the bottling.

12:44.700 --> 12:47.300
-In the schools,,,,
-We walked eight miles,

12:47.400 --> 12:50.600
-I walked 12 miles,
-Kip, milk and biscuits,

12:50.700 --> 12:53.100
Can you wonder they're
screaming out for roughage?

12:53.300 --> 12:56.900
We walked 20 miles barefoot
to save dad's boots,

12:57.200 --> 13:01.700
-Excuse me, the YWCA, please.
-First right, second left, straight across.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.500
-Can't miss it.
-Thanks, awfully.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.600
That's not the YW.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.500
We are here today,,,,

13:15.600 --> 13:16.600
-It's up,
-She's in,

13:16.800 --> 13:19.900
-Is it announced?
-Here, at the heartbeat of a great nation,

13:20.100 --> 13:23.500
-Here today, great--
-Well-served by the finest,

13:23.800 --> 13:26.300
We walked 30 miles with gun and camera,

13:26.500 --> 13:29.800
-Great, great,
-They're trained for it,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.300
Heritage in motion,

13:32.400 --> 13:35.900
God bless her sale and all who bought it,
and I'm in labor,

13:36.400 --> 13:40.100
The angle of incidence
is equal to the angle of reflection.

13:40.400 --> 13:44.600
The angle of incidence
is equal to the angle of reflection.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.300
-The sine of the angle of incidence...
-The sine of the angle of incidence...

13:49.600 --> 13:52.500
...divided by the sine
of the angle of refraction...

13:52.800 --> 13:55.700
...divided by the sine
of the angle of refraction...

13:55.800 --> 13:57.000
...is constant.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.600
...is constant.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.200
-Not that simple, is it?
-Sir? That hurt, sir.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.900
You steaming nit, sir.

14:45.000 --> 14:45.900
Yes.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.600
Served the little bastard right.

14:47.700 --> 14:51.100
No, no! In this beautiful school?

14:52.700 --> 14:56.700
You see, I tried to be unsympathetic,
because it's wrong. Isn't it wrong?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.300
I'm a failure.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.400
-I never get it where I want it.
-I don't think they'd rape me.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.500
-Do you?
-I don't know.

15:06.700 --> 15:10.300
-Yes. I mean, no. Why?
-Best place is tight and hard...

15:10.500 --> 15:12.700
...between the eyes
on the bone where it hurts.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.700
I'm usually just off.
Never get a bang-on shot.

15:15.800 --> 15:16.900
-Off?
-Rape.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.800
Exchange teacher out at Camberwell.
Part-time actress.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.800
-I had a beauty once.
-Actress?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.300
Your class. She said you have no control.

15:24.500 --> 15:28.800
Skipping ricochet off a desk lid
right up his nostril. His left one.

15:29.100 --> 15:31.500
No, I tell a lie, his right nostril.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.100
Half an inch of yellow chalk
vanished from view.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.000
-Very satisfying.
-The way your class was behaving!

15:37.300 --> 15:39.400
-My class?
-Their behavior....

15:40.100 --> 15:44.100
Her class was doing the behaving!
My lads are made of flesh.

15:44.200 --> 15:48.300
All that leaping up and down in those....
That's what I behavior!

15:48.800 --> 15:50.500
That's provocative behavior!

15:50.600 --> 15:53.300
We've all got to make allowances,
find our equilibrium.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.400
At every turn, how?

16:43.500 --> 16:47.600
I thought I would never see such
purity of pattern, absolute rightness.

16:47.800 --> 16:51.700
I must please you, and I think I can.
Don't fail me now.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.400
Or I'll never be able to trust myself
with a woman ever again.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.600
Try it on.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.300
I'm sure.
I know, absolutely, I can please you.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.800
Show me.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.800
Wait for me.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.800
I thought I would never see such
purity of pattern, absolute rightness.

17:18.099 --> 17:21.200
I must please you, and I think I can.
Don't fail me.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.500
Else I shall never be able to trust myself
with a woman again, ever.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.300
Try it on. I'm sure.

17:27.500 --> 17:31.100
I know I can please you.
Show me. Wait for me.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.100
I thought I would never see such
purity of pattern, absolute rightness.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.000
I must please you, and I think can.

18:16.300 --> 18:18.200
Don't fail me now.

18:18.200 --> 18:22.500
Because I shall never be able to trust
myself with a woman again, ever.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.300
Try it on.

18:24.600 --> 18:28.000
I'm sure.
I know, absolutely, I can help you.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.800
-How much is this coat, please?
-Show me.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.800
Wait for me.

18:35.700 --> 18:37.500
If I should see this girl....

18:39.600 --> 18:41.600
Should I come across?

18:41.900 --> 18:45.300
Perhaps, would you show me? If.... Tolen!

18:45.700 --> 18:47.700
Why aren't you in school, Colin?

18:48.300 --> 18:49.900
-lsn't it nippy?
-No.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.600
Free period and a half day for me
while they have sports.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.200
I don't find it cold.
You don't eat the right food.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.700
-It's not that, Tolen.
-It's about that spare room.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.700
-You've at long last decided to let.
-Listen.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.500
How can I get a--

19:04.900 --> 19:06.800
How can I get a woman?

19:07.200 --> 19:09.200
-Want advice?
-How?

19:09.300 --> 19:12.100
-The right food is important.
-It's not that, listen!

19:12.400 --> 19:17.100
If I should see this girl, listen,
should I come across....

19:18.600 --> 19:20.300
Would you show me?

19:22.300 --> 19:26.100
-You mean, how I get women?
-Yes.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.700
-Yes, I mean that.
-But you haven't even started.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.000
-The right food.
-The right food doesn't--

19:31.100 --> 19:33.200
It's of the utmost importance,
of the essence.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.200
One's body needs protein and energy.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.400
Yes, but look--

19:36.600 --> 19:38.800
I find that with my perhaps
unusual sexual demands...

19:39.000 --> 19:42.300
...my body requires at least
twice the normal daily intake of protein.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.900
I won't need that much, will l?

19:45.300 --> 19:46.800
-Protein!
-No.

19:47.100 --> 19:50.400
You could do yourself damage.
Stoke up the fire, block up the chimney.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.600
-Have you got a piece of paper, Tolen?
-Cheese, eggs, milk, meat.

19:53.900 --> 19:56.700
-I drink about four pints of milk a day.
-I want to get it down!

19:56.900 --> 19:58.500
-I eat a pound of steak.
-Steak.

19:58.700 --> 20:01.800
Needn't be the most expensive.
Cheaper cuts have the same value.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.500
-For instance, skirt.
-Skirt.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.500
-Skirt.
-ls that it?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.100
Cheese, eggs, milk, meat, skirt.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.400
-ls that it?
-What?

20:08.500 --> 20:10.300
-How you do it?
-Skirt is meat.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.200
How, though? How?

20:12.400 --> 20:16.200
I could tell you what I know intellectually,
what my experience has been.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.200
But beyond that, it's intuition.

20:18.400 --> 20:23.200
-And intuition is, to some degree, inborn.
-"lntuition is, to some degree, inborn."

20:23.500 --> 20:27.100
Intuition is, to some degree, inborn.

20:27.900 --> 20:31.300
But the feeling can be developed
with experience and confidence.

20:31.400 --> 20:35.200
In certain people, to some degree,
a man can develop the knack.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.000
"A man can develop the knack."

20:38.200 --> 20:40.600
A man can develop the knack,

20:43.900 --> 20:45.300
-Look at women.
-Yes!

20:47.600 --> 20:49.700
-I can't hear you!
-Women,

20:49.900 --> 20:52.000
Not individuals, Just types,

21:01.900 --> 21:03.900
That last one had very nice earlobes.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.200
Earlobes?

21:06.800 --> 21:10.300
-How do I acquire the knack?
-Yes, how? The knack!

21:10.400 --> 21:13.200
Now, first you must establish contact.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.300
Yes! Contact?

21:15.500 --> 21:17.600
-I'm busy.
-No, you were telling me.

21:17.700 --> 21:20.400
-Establish contact.
-Yes, and I'm not referring to touch.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.400
-Not to touch.
-Tactile communication.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.600
-But that comes later.
-Touch comes later!

21:24.800 --> 21:27.100
Excuse me.
I mean, there's a feeling between you.

21:27.300 --> 21:28.300
A feeling!

21:28.400 --> 21:29.700
-You're aware of her.
-Aware!

21:29.900 --> 21:31.600
-The girl's aware of you.
-She's aware!

21:31.700 --> 21:34.600
-There's a vibration between--
-Vibration!

21:35.800 --> 21:38.500
Hold on! It's fine for you with this job.

21:38.800 --> 21:42.300
I don't get this in the common room.
Wait, tell me!

21:49.600 --> 21:52.000
Stop! No, don't stop!

21:52.100 --> 21:55.400
The knack!
You haven't finished telling me!

21:55.700 --> 21:58.500
Tolen! I've wet my trousers!

21:58.700 --> 22:01.700
You know that you need help?
You do know that, don't you?

22:01.800 --> 22:04.900
Yes. I mean, obviously, yes, I need help.

22:05.100 --> 22:06.000
Help!

22:06.200 --> 22:09.400
Tell me, how many women have you had?

22:10.300 --> 22:11.800
I was late starting.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.300
-Two?
-Late!

22:13.400 --> 22:14.800
Two women in two years.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.800
Some of us have had
more women in two hours.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.400
Late starting!

22:22.400 --> 22:24.300
I have a suggestion to make to you.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.700
A suggestion which
I think you'll find interesting...

22:26.900 --> 22:28.200
...and will help you very much.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.900
-I've been soaked.
-It's an idea I've had.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.100
Here, my bed.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.500
Do you think it's any good,
me getting a bigger bed?

22:34.700 --> 22:36.300
-Two women in two years.
-Late!

22:38.500 --> 22:42.000
Now, I'm cramped in that bed.
Will you shut the window?

22:42.200 --> 22:45.600
-Your bed is ample for your needs.
-I'm gonna get pneumonia.

22:45.700 --> 22:48.600
-But future plans?
-As you know, I have a number of friends.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.700
-Yes.
-Men.

22:50.900 --> 22:54.500
They can help you as I can help you.
I was thinking of Rory McBryde.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.800
-Rory?
-McBryde.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.600
-The window!
-Rory McBryde is a man.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.300
A clever man, a gifted man...

23:02.500 --> 23:04.800
...a man I can respect,
who knows many things.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.800
Rory McBryde was doing things at 13
that you haven't ever done.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.100
Things you don't know about.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.700
-What sort of things?
-ln a moment.

23:10.800 --> 23:14.100
-Has he got the knack? Or these things?
-First, let me tell you my idea.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.400
Look, I really do need a bigger bed.
Don't l, really?

23:17.600 --> 23:19.100
I have a number of girlfriends.

23:19.300 --> 23:22.200
Regular girlfriends, regular women,
women I regularly make.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.100
-These things--
-Rory has a number of regular women, too.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.200
Not quite so many as I have, but several.

23:27.400 --> 23:31.500
Rory and I were talking, comparing notes,
and we decided it would be a good idea...

23:31.800 --> 23:34.800
...if we saw each other more often,
even live near each other.

23:35.300 --> 23:37.100
Perhaps in the same house.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.100
-What, here?
-Share our women.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.100
Share?

23:41.300 --> 23:43.800
Of course, Rory realizes
it could be dangerous for him.

23:43.900 --> 23:47.600
-He might lose a few of his women.
-He wouldn't want that, would he?

23:48.300 --> 23:49.700
I mean, it's a big house.

23:49.800 --> 23:53.600
Rory is well aware that in the long run
he will profit by the arrangement.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.800
He will learn much
from the women who have been with me.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.000
No.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.600
-No?
-No, not that spare room.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.800
That spare room needs
a steadying influence.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.800
I would consider
letting you come in on this arrangement.

24:08.700 --> 24:10.600
-Sharing?
-You'd learn a great many things.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.200
-What sort of things?
-lt'd be a privilege for you.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.500
No.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.000
I feel you deserve to be helped.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.600
Look, couldn't I just share....

24:20.800 --> 24:23.300
-Do you think he will?
-lf I ask him, he will.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.200
No, I don't think so.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.900
You'll like him. I'll tell him to call round.

24:29.100 --> 24:32.500
Perhaps not, it's a dirty room.
Needs a lot of work on it.

24:32.700 --> 24:36.100
I wouldn't like any friend of yours....
It needs redecorating.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.400
It's no place to share women in and things.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.500
Look, what sort of things?

24:41.000 --> 24:43.800
The bed! The bed's terrible.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.700
He could not do....

24:46.200 --> 24:48.500
He could have my old one
when I get my new one.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.000
Rory McBryde has got a six-foot bed.

24:51.100 --> 24:54.200
-He wouldn't find mine big enough?
-No.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.800
Couldn't I just share your women?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.100
You don't want him rampaging
through the house...

24:59.300 --> 25:01.600
...all over the place
with women and things.

25:01.900 --> 25:05.100
A house full of women and sharing
and doing things that none of us...

25:05.300 --> 25:06.900
...ever dreamt of doing before!

25:50.700 --> 25:54.100
No. I could not.
I couldn't stand the pace. Really.

25:54.300 --> 25:58.600
I'm not fussy about letting that room
because it's always as well having a spare.

25:58.900 --> 26:02.000
You find it very useful
to avoid clashes on the stairs, don't you?

26:02.300 --> 26:06.000
-No. I couldn't stand the pace.
-Rory has a Chinese girl.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.100
-Slinky.
-Slinky.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.200
Chinese, very slinky, very nice.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.200
-Do very well for you.
-Chinese?

26:12.400 --> 26:16.600
-I'll tell him to call round, look at the room.
-No. I couldn't stand the pace.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.500
Not two of you. I couldn't.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.200
I burnt my hand.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.100
-Colin?
-No!

26:31.300 --> 26:34.300
-And a Swedish girl.
-Swedish?

26:35.200 --> 26:36.700
Swedish.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.500
No! I couldn't stand it.
It would drive me mad.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.500
Two of them?
The stairs would be on the continual go.

26:43.700 --> 26:46.300
All those women. My blood's not up to it.

26:46.500 --> 26:50.300
And what about the bathroom?
You'd never ever get near to the bathroom.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
That's not a gross exaggeration.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.100
I'm not having it.

27:04.900 --> 27:06.500
Having it.

27:07.900 --> 27:08.900
No!

27:09.900 --> 27:13.600
I'm not having it. Having it. No!

27:14.500 --> 27:15.900
Having it. No!

27:16.000 --> 27:18.500
Having it. No! I'm not having it!

27:18.700 --> 27:20.300
Having it. No!

27:21.500 --> 27:22.900
No Rory in my house.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.600
One is enough.
One lot of women is enough for any house.

27:38.300 --> 27:40.100
If a job is worth--

27:40.200 --> 27:43.700
A job is worth nothing
these days of jobbery in high places,

27:43.800 --> 27:46.800
-Look at the Cabinet,
-You can't get a good cabinet for love,

27:47.100 --> 27:50.700
They don 't seem to have the same pride
in their craft they used to have,

27:50.900 --> 27:54.700
Craft has been flung out of the window,
It's all the human body now,

27:56.400 --> 27:58.800
I adore a piece of wood, its feel,

27:59.400 --> 28:03.000
I hope I always get a kick
from the feel of a length of wood,

28:03.200 --> 28:07.500
-Homegrown loans for self-improvement,
-He's making improvements all the time,

28:07.800 --> 28:11.700
Two houses in every garage by 1970,
You can 't say fairer than that,

28:11.900 --> 28:15.600
-Of course, it harbors rats, you know?
-Jerry-built. Pardon my French.

28:30.500 --> 28:34.300
There is mastery in a job well done
if you have a way with tools,

28:34.600 --> 28:38.400
-A good workman never blames his,,,,
-I do, I blame the screwdriver,

28:40.400 --> 28:44.000
-I like the twist of a good screw,
-I'm bound,

28:44.300 --> 28:46.800
You can 't get a good splinter these days,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.900
The art's gone out of it,
It's quicker by tube,

28:50.100 --> 28:52.600
I'm bound to ask for a good finish,

28:55.900 --> 28:57.000
I say,,,,

28:57.100 --> 28:59.900
-Shame to hide a good screw,
-Workers' Playtime,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
She took off her wooden leg,
and she put it on the mantelpiece,

29:03.200 --> 29:07.400
Then she took out her glass eye,
Well, I'll never see the like again,

29:09.900 --> 29:11.700
That is indeed a job.

29:14.500 --> 29:17.400
-I can't get out.
-I can't get in.

29:18.300 --> 29:21.000
-But I feel better.
-ls Rory there?

29:22.100 --> 29:23.700
There. Rory. I sent him round.

29:23.800 --> 29:24.800
-ln?
-There.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.300
Out!

29:30.100 --> 29:32.500
-What's he look like?
-Tell him I'll be there.

29:32.600 --> 29:33.600
Never mind.

29:47.700 --> 29:52.000
Small, vigorous, balanced,
sensitive in his movements, painting--

29:52.200 --> 29:54.700
Painting? Doesn't sound like Rory.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.500
What the hell are you doing
in Rory's room?

30:03.400 --> 30:04.600
Who's this?

30:05.500 --> 30:08.200
-It's not?
-No, it's not. That window's filthy.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.100
-I'll wash them.
-You've let the room.

30:11.300 --> 30:12.500
-Tom.
-Colin.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.700
The door was open,
and I saw it was brown...

30:14.900 --> 30:19.300
...and I thought I'd get stuck in right away
before you said no. Just once.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
-Your sign.
-"Room to let."

30:22.200 --> 30:23.800
-I'll take it.
-I hope you'll be happy.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.100
-Look at this filth.
-Tolen.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.100
-I'm going to wash the windows.
-I've got some Windowlene.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.700
Got it.

30:44.500 --> 30:49.100
"Wipe it on, Windowlene,
wipe it off, window clean."

30:49.400 --> 30:53.500
Washing with water and polishing with
paper would have less electrostatic action.

30:53.800 --> 30:57.700
Would repel dirt more efficiently.
Try the other half. Go on.

30:58.300 --> 30:59.900
-What?
-The other half.

31:03.300 --> 31:07.400
You do realize that in order to clean the
window you have to wipe off the cleaner.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.100
The white stuff has to be
polished off the window.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.700
-He's not going to leave it on.
-You can't leave it on.

31:14.200 --> 31:17.600
"Wipe on sparingly with a dry cloth,
then wipe off immediately."

31:18.200 --> 31:20.600
You're not gonna leave that stuff on.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.700
It's as good as net curtains, only better.

31:23.900 --> 31:26.700
-Net curtains?
-You should paint your windows white.

31:26.900 --> 31:30.100
White reflects heat.
All right when the bomb drops.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.100
-What?
-Okay when the bomb drops.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.700
The YWCA?

32:00.100 --> 32:03.000
The YWCA.

32:03.300 --> 32:07.500
YW-YW-YWCA. Martin's Grove, West 2.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.300
It's for me.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.600
Eighth of December.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.700
Albert Hall.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.700
Rory McBryde.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.200
I'll tell her.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.500
Don't you ever let me
catch you in here again.

32:41.700 --> 32:42.600
Sorry.

32:45.200 --> 32:49.300
-What's this?
-Brown. I can't bear brown.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.600
This.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.600
-What?
-I have a friend coming down the stairs.

33:00.800 --> 33:03.800
-I have a friend in Newcastle.
-This furniture....

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Doesn't impress me.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.200
She won't like clambering over furniture.

33:07.400 --> 33:10.300
If she was an elephant,
that would impress me. Tell me she is.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.800
After being with me, a girl doesn't
feel like clambering over furniture.

33:14.100 --> 33:15.600
After an elephant, neither would you.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.900
-Are you a homosexual?
-No.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.900
Thanks all the same.

33:21.300 --> 33:25.200
-Tolen! Hold on!
-Would you come this way, sir?

33:29.300 --> 33:30.500
Tolen!

33:34.800 --> 33:36.900
I'm glad I didn't put my stockings on.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.900
That damn stuff in the passage,
you'll have to move it.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.300
He can use the window.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.800
-I said, move it.
-I'm not having it in here.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.800
-I'm not having it in the passage.
-I'm not having it in here.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.900
When you take a furnished room,
you take the furniture as well.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.300
-Not that.
-What's wrong with my furniture?

34:04.500 --> 34:07.100
I'm not having it in here,
that's what's wrong with it.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.199
If I were you, I'd take it to the market.

34:09.400 --> 34:13.300
I beg your pardon. That's my furniture,
and I'm not having you sell it.

34:17.699 --> 34:20.000
Typical Rory McBryde trick, that.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.600
We can put it on the top landing.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.100
-Outside my room?
-No. Inside your room.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.900
-I hoped you'd be a steadying influence.
-That furniture--

34:30.000 --> 34:31.600
-How long?
-What?

34:31.600 --> 34:33.000
How long did you take this time?

34:33.199 --> 34:34.500
-Did you?
-How long?

34:34.699 --> 34:36.800
-Did you time me?
-Did you time yourself?

34:36.900 --> 34:40.900
It's the bed, isn't it? That's what does it.
And did you? Have you?

34:41.100 --> 34:43.400
-No more than 10 minutes.
-10 minutes!

34:43.600 --> 34:45.300
It's the bed. 10 minutes!

34:45.500 --> 34:49.000
Do you think I'm so crude,
so vulgar, as to time myself when I'm at a--

34:49.300 --> 34:52.400
-10 minutes.
-How big is your bed, Tolen?

34:52.500 --> 34:56.300
Ten minutes from wink to blink,
from start to finish?

34:56.600 --> 34:57.700
From hello to good-bye?

34:57.800 --> 35:01.900
Ten minutes. You're sliding, man.
You're slipping. You're letting us down.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.900
You can do better than that.

35:04.100 --> 35:07.000
Faster, man, faster.
You've got the capacity.

35:07.200 --> 35:10.100
-No. He's got a six-foot bed.
-Listen, Tolen, four.

35:10.300 --> 35:11.800
Dreams, I've got for you.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.900
Four minutes.
Four minutes from start to finish.

35:15.100 --> 35:16.900
Get it down to four minutes.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.300
Yours is quite big, isn't it?
How big is your bed?

35:22.200 --> 35:25.100
The four-minute mile.
Like the four-minute mile.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.800
Heroic. Think.
A new series in the Olympic games.

35:27.900 --> 35:29.800
British native and all-comers record.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.600
Yes, and then by discipline,
by training, by application...

35:32.800 --> 35:36.100
...three minutes 59 seconds,
three minutes 55, three minutes 50.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.700
And then one day, one unimaginable day...

35:39.800 --> 35:41.800
...three minutes from start to finish!

35:54.700 --> 35:57.600
-Excuse me. The YWCA, please.
-Yes.

36:02.700 --> 36:06.200
Then take the first turning over,
then once more around left.

36:06.300 --> 36:07.900
There you'll find it.

36:13.700 --> 36:16.200
-ls it nicer faster?
-Nice?

36:16.300 --> 36:20.500
-Nice, that's not the point.
-I'm getting a new bed.

36:21.300 --> 36:24.700
-What's Tolen's first name?
-He says he hasn't got one.

36:24.900 --> 36:26.800
-Not got one?
-Well, he never uses it.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.900
Look, I want....
I will want to bring my old bed down.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.600
-lf he never uses it--
-My bed downstairs.

36:32.800 --> 36:35.200
-He must have it.
-There's too much stuff in the passage.

36:35.400 --> 36:40.200
-Why do you want to bring it downstairs?
-I'm getting another, a bigger one, six-foot.

36:40.700 --> 36:44.100
-Through the window. How big?
-Vast.

36:45.100 --> 36:46.900
I know where there's a big bed.

36:51.300 --> 36:52.800
That?

36:52.800 --> 36:56.300
No. I want something sexy,
quilted, with a very loud noise.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.100
A lilt of lrish laughter?

36:58.200 --> 37:02.500
If you like.
I just don't see meself in a cast-iron bed.

37:02.800 --> 37:06.100
One mustn't be misled
by apparent metal fatigue.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.000
I'll take it!

37:16.800 --> 37:20.200
And it's twice as big as Tolen's, almost.

37:23.300 --> 37:25.900
-I'll take it.
-I should. It's musical.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.200
How much? I don't care.
I don't care how much.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.600
Hark at that.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.100
-You want it?
-I want it.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.200
At 13, were you promiscuous?

37:39.400 --> 37:42.400
Weren't all of us, more or less,
sexual failures?

37:42.900 --> 37:46.500
-Tolen isn't a sexual failure.
-He needs it five hours a day, he says.

37:46.700 --> 37:49.200
Then he can't be a sexual failure, can he?

37:50.900 --> 37:53.000
He can't be a sexual failure.

37:53.900 --> 37:57.300
He can't be a sexual failure,
having it five hours a day, can he?

37:57.500 --> 38:00.700
-And it's bigger than Tolen's.
-ls it?

38:02.100 --> 38:04.100
He can't be though, can he?

38:10.700 --> 38:14.000
There. Chat her up.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.400
-Speak to her. Ask her the time.
-No.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.200
Ask her to lend you six pence.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.500
No. You. I want to buy my bed.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.500
Off to the flat.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.200
-The YWCA?
-Yeah.

38:26.400 --> 38:27.700
How much?

38:27.700 --> 38:30.300
-Here?
-What? No.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.200
I'll ask if anyone has seen it.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.600
-Will you take it?
-Yes. I'll take it.

38:34.700 --> 38:35.900
Have you seen it?

38:36.100 --> 38:38.200
-Have I seen what?
-The YWCA.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.000
She wants....

38:41.100 --> 38:44.000
-Through the streets?
-Yes. Through the streets.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.800
-Would you like a lift?
-A lift?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.900
-I can't bring it round.
-To the YW.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.100
-Yes. Is it on your way?
-We'll take it. We'll have it. I'll have it.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.100
-We'll walk it.
-Certainly, it's on our way.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.700
Where is it?

39:01.000 --> 39:03.700
She's coming to the YW.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.200
With that bed?

39:05.400 --> 39:07.700
That's not a bed.
It's an Edwardian trampoline.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.400
-It's a bed.
-No. Isn't it, Colin?

39:10.600 --> 39:13.300
-No. It's my bed.
-It's a bed.

39:13.500 --> 39:16.000
With wheels. It's wheeled traffic.

39:16.200 --> 39:19.300
-Wheel it away. Come on.
-Wagon, ho!

39:20.700 --> 39:22.500
Mods and rockers,

39:25.900 --> 39:27.300
My bed!

39:38.500 --> 39:42.300
There's not a bus route in London
free of its share of youth, vice,

39:42.600 --> 39:45.700
Hand back the city
to those with their fair share of legs,

39:45.900 --> 39:49.400
They'll do anything
but use the good feet they were born with,

39:49.600 --> 39:52.300
-Anything but walk,
-Mine's the same,

39:52.400 --> 39:53.800
They'll settle,

39:53.900 --> 39:57.100
I wouldn 't be seen dead on a bed,
from a personal angle,

39:57.300 --> 39:59.200
It's a young man 's game,

40:04.400 --> 40:08.500
I mean, I'm broad-minded,
but a bed's place is definitely in the home,

40:08.800 --> 40:11.700
-Definitely,
-We have our own sleeping arrangements,

40:11.900 --> 40:13.300
Mods and rockers,

40:17.500 --> 40:18.700
See that?

40:21.100 --> 40:23.700
Just a minute. I'll be back.

40:27.100 --> 40:30.000
Excuse me, sir.
You're wanted on the other fern.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.400
It's all initiative now.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.700
I don't personally subscribe
to that sort of program.

41:10.900 --> 41:12.400
They'll answer in court.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.100
I come from Hampton Wick myself,
so I'm used to innuendo.

42:46.100 --> 42:50.900
-There's no national heritage anymore.
-No. It's all on the National Health.

43:49.400 --> 43:51.100
I was never given the opportunity,,,

43:51.200 --> 43:54.000
,,,to so much as breaststroke
before I was sent to sea,,,

43:54.200 --> 43:56.100
,,,and I'm much better for it,

44:33.400 --> 44:36.600
What's the most frightening
building in London?

44:36.700 --> 44:39.200
Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children.

44:39.300 --> 44:40.600
I believe you're right.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.000
What's that?

44:42.100 --> 44:44.300
Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children.

44:44.500 --> 44:48.500
That's nice. That's true.
That's a nice thing to say.

44:48.700 --> 44:50.200
Do you think so?

45:00.700 --> 45:03.100
-I've been picked up, haven't l?
-Have you?

45:04.000 --> 45:05.500
Yes, I have, haven't l?

45:09.900 --> 45:11.100
Like a howdah.

45:11.300 --> 45:13.200
-A what?
-Howdy do!

45:13.200 --> 45:14.600
Like on an elephant.

45:14.800 --> 45:18.300
You know, the lndians keep elephants
the way we keep cows.

45:18.500 --> 45:19.600
It's true.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.500
I always wondered
how big an elephant's udder was.

45:22.700 --> 45:25.600
My God.
Imagine it swishing round and round.

45:25.700 --> 45:29.500
In Walt Disney's early films, there were
cows and the censor cut the udders out.

45:29.800 --> 45:33.200
Yeah, so he put brassieres on them.
Imagine.

45:33.500 --> 45:38.100
Jersey cows wear brassieres, it's true.
Jersey cows wear brassieres.

45:38.300 --> 45:41.200
There's something wrong there.
Cows shouldn't need brassieres.

45:41.300 --> 45:43.900
Human beings need them
because they stand upright.

45:44.100 --> 45:47.100
They used to go on all fours,
and they hung downwards, vertically.

45:47.300 --> 45:50.700
Now they stand upright,
and it puts on this terrible strain.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.400
All right. All right, but it's true.

45:59.100 --> 46:02.600
-That wouldn't arise with elephants.
-I wish you'd push more and talk less.

46:02.800 --> 46:03.700
Showing off.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.400
-I don't show off.
-And you do.

46:06.500 --> 46:09.000
-Wait till Tolen sees my bed.
-Tolen?

46:09.200 --> 46:10.700
-Yeah, you won't like Tolen.
-No.

46:10.900 --> 46:13.400
-I like who I want to like.
-Good. You won't like him.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.600
-She might like Tolen or Rory.
-Come on. Up.

46:17.800 --> 46:20.300
How can you tell
when an elephant's been in the fridge?

46:20.500 --> 46:21.900
He leaves footprints in the butter.

46:22.100 --> 46:23.200
-You knew.
-I don't.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.000
-I've heard it before.
-Don't show off.

46:25.100 --> 46:26.100
Look! Your end!

46:26.200 --> 46:27.400
-lt'll never go.
-lt will.

46:27.500 --> 46:28.900
-I do, sometimes.
-Never.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.500
-You're not!
-I am!

46:32.900 --> 46:35.600
My leg! I hurt my leg.

46:41.400 --> 46:42.800
She's in there.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.300
I know she's in there.

46:46.900 --> 46:49.800
I recognized your voice.
You've got my daughter in there.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.500
I recognize her voice, too.
Raves. You havin' raves?

46:53.600 --> 46:56.400
-Has it become one long rave?
-I won't say any more.

46:56.600 --> 46:58.300
Just get your clothes on.

46:58.400 --> 47:00.900
I've just.... I don't live here.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.600
-You're the one.
-The one?

47:02.600 --> 47:03.600
She's in there.

47:03.800 --> 47:05.800
-Did you want someone?
-With Rory McBryde.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Does he live here?

47:07.000 --> 47:08.300
-What, you don't live here?
-No.

47:08.500 --> 47:10.600
-All right for my daughter.
-Does she live here?

47:10.700 --> 47:14.300
-You trying to be funny?
-No. I don't live here. Shall I get them?

47:14.500 --> 47:17.900
-She's never out of there.
-ls it a friend? 'Cause the door's blocked.

47:18.200 --> 47:20.700
You first introduced her
to the hemp from the Orient.

47:20.900 --> 47:23.000
-Me?
-She comes home full of it.

47:23.100 --> 47:26.000
-Shall I get them?
-With Rory McBryde.

47:26.800 --> 47:28.600
-Tolen?
-Tolen?

47:30.500 --> 47:34.400
Dear. You're right. Wrong bloke.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.300
I can't keep track.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.800
-Well, you're not them.
-No.

47:39.900 --> 47:41.600
I don't think so. I don't know him.

47:41.800 --> 47:44.800
Whatever you do, don't let them
force you to submit to the hemp.

47:45.300 --> 47:47.200
-Good afternoon.
-Right, then, Mr. Hemp.

47:47.200 --> 47:50.700
We were just a-chatting about you.
Cold enough for you?

47:51.400 --> 47:55.300
They don't like that, you know.
They must hear that 20 times a day.

47:55.800 --> 48:00.000
If you do see my daughter,
you tell her Rory's got a bigger bed.

48:26.400 --> 48:27.900
Where's Colin?

48:34.000 --> 48:35.200
Look out!

48:49.200 --> 48:50.700
-That hall.
-My leg.

48:50.800 --> 48:52.300
That bloody hall!

48:54.300 --> 48:57.400
-Look. I've hurt my leg.
-I can't get up to my room.

48:57.600 --> 48:58.900
I can't get in the front door.

48:59.100 --> 49:01.600
-What about my leg?
-I don't care about your leg.

49:01.700 --> 49:03.400
What about access?

49:05.100 --> 49:09.800
-You can have that. You can have access.
-Just got to do a bit of climbing, that's all.

49:10.100 --> 49:13.300
Should be a sparkle,
see your girlfriends climbing over that.

49:13.500 --> 49:16.000
I told you about that mess in the hall,
didn't l?

49:16.200 --> 49:19.400
The thing is, you don't impress me.

49:21.000 --> 49:21.900
That mess.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.900
-What mess?
-You made a mess....

49:24.200 --> 49:25.100
-Jack?
-No.

49:25.300 --> 49:27.800
-I mean that bloody bed.
-Don't swear.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
-Just come off the boat, have you?
-See Colin about the mess.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.800
It's his house, mate. It's not yours.

49:41.200 --> 49:43.600
Now, Colin. Tell him I want access.

49:50.700 --> 49:52.600
-Lions.
-Lions.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.400
-Lions.
-Must you be so childish?

49:54.600 --> 49:55.700
-What?
-Colin!

49:55.800 --> 49:58.100
Want to know how
they train lions to stand on boxes?

49:58.200 --> 50:00.800
-Access, Colin.
-I'll tell you how they train them.

50:00.900 --> 50:03.700
Now first, you must have a box.
This bucket.

50:03.800 --> 50:07.300
Look. Now, imagine that this
is the limit of the cage...

50:08.200 --> 50:09.200
...the bars.

50:09.300 --> 50:11.500
-Must you be so childish?
-Childlike.

50:11.700 --> 50:14.500
Now, the trainer takes his whip.
Whip. Whip.

50:14.800 --> 50:18.100
No. We'll do without a whip.
A lion. Must have a lion.

50:18.300 --> 50:22.600
Who'll be a lion? Anyone.
Anyway, he takes the box in his left hand...

50:22.900 --> 50:25.100
...and the whip, imagine the whip,
in his right.

50:25.300 --> 50:29.300
And he advances on the lion.
And he drives, "Back! Back! Back!"

50:29.600 --> 50:30.900
To the bars.

50:31.100 --> 50:35.200
This is a critical moment,
when the lion realizes...

50:35.400 --> 50:39.300
...that he must leap at his attacker.
Otherwise, it'll be too late.

50:39.600 --> 50:43.000
The trainer recognizes the critical moment.

50:43.300 --> 50:47.000
So at the moment the lion rears to attack,
the trainer draws back...

50:47.200 --> 50:50.200
...and the lion, no longer threatened,
drops his forepaws...

50:50.500 --> 50:52.800
...and finds himself standing on the box.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.700
Do this a few times,
you've trained a lion to stand on a box.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.600
Colin.

50:58.100 --> 51:00.000
How did the box get there?

51:00.400 --> 51:03.300
-You've still got it in your hand.
-The trainer puts it there.

51:03.500 --> 51:06.700
-When?
-Look. Here, look. I'll be a lion.

51:09.700 --> 51:12.100
-Makes you feel sexy.
-I'll be a lion.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.800
-All right.
-And me.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.500
If I roared into something,
it'd make more resonance.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.200
Look, that's the lion's box.

51:21.500 --> 51:23.000
This, then.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.500
-You can't have that.
-It's all right.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.700
-Yeah, yeah!
-Roar!

51:33.800 --> 51:36.300
You should wear a carrier bag more often.

51:41.600 --> 51:44.800
You're exciting him.
Don't you realize he's a desperate man?

51:47.500 --> 51:49.000
Just a minute.

51:51.700 --> 51:54.200
-I'll be trainer, then, shall l?
-All right.

51:56.100 --> 51:57.400
All right, ready?

51:59.100 --> 52:01.700
Back! Come on! Back!

52:45.400 --> 52:48.300
Just think what you could do
with a real whip.

52:48.400 --> 52:49.800
A real whip.

53:09.700 --> 53:13.200
Some tea. Some tea you've indicated.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.600
I hurt my head.

53:37.400 --> 53:39.200
Put it through the wall.

53:40.200 --> 53:41.300
Colin?

53:45.300 --> 53:46.500
Come on.

53:50.300 --> 53:52.300
-Come on.
-Kettle's boiling.

53:53.800 --> 53:58.300
Colin, throw that carrier bag away. Away!

53:59.500 --> 54:01.500
Shall we get the bed straight?

54:04.700 --> 54:07.100
The YWCA, that's where?

54:07.300 --> 54:09.700
-Where is it?
-Address?

54:09.900 --> 54:12.000
Martin's Grove, West 2.

54:12.300 --> 54:13.700
Where's that?

54:14.100 --> 54:15.900
I'll get the map.

54:16.500 --> 54:19.100
-Thanks.
-That's all right.

54:19.500 --> 54:21.700
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.500
I'll get you some tea.

54:28.100 --> 54:29.900
You've got Chinese eyebrows.

54:31.200 --> 54:34.800
Chinese eyebrows.
Very clear arch, very delicate.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.900
-Have l?
-Have you got a mirror? I'll show you.

54:38.300 --> 54:40.900
-What's your name?
-Nancy.

54:41.300 --> 54:44.300
-Nancy Jones. What's yours?
-Tolen.

54:44.800 --> 54:47.200
Tolen? Tolen what?

54:48.300 --> 54:50.800
Tolen.

54:51.500 --> 54:53.400
I see, like Mantovani.

54:53.700 --> 54:56.200
-Pardon?
-Like Mantovani.

54:56.400 --> 54:58.400
Nothing Mantovani, Mantovani nothing.

54:58.600 --> 55:01.400
-Would you tell me what you mean?
-Have you not heard of him?

55:01.600 --> 55:03.800
He's a conductor. He conducts.

55:04.300 --> 55:06.800
-ls it your surname or your Christian name?
-Surname.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.300
-What's your Christian name?
-I prefer not to use it.

55:09.400 --> 55:10.500
Why?

55:11.000 --> 55:14.700
I don't use it. I have no first name.
I never use my first name.

55:15.300 --> 55:18.600
What's the matter?
Is there anything the matter with you?

55:18.800 --> 55:19.800
No.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
-Why are you so nervous?
-I'm not.

55:22.200 --> 55:23.700
You look nervous.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.600
Me, nervous?

55:26.400 --> 55:28.400
-Do l?
-Yeah.

55:28.500 --> 55:30.000
-Yeah?
-Nothing.

55:30.200 --> 55:32.600
-What's the matter?
-It's--

55:32.700 --> 55:34.400
-Well?
-It's--

55:34.600 --> 55:37.500
You are nervous, aren't you?
Very nervous.

55:38.200 --> 55:41.200
-Why don't you take your coat off?
-I don't want to.

55:41.500 --> 55:44.600
-My dear, you will take it off.
-I don't want to.

55:44.700 --> 55:46.700
-Why don't you want to?
-It's--

55:46.900 --> 55:49.100
-Yes?
-You're looking at me.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.500
-Am l?
-Yeah.

55:50.700 --> 55:52.100
-How am I looking?
-I don't know.

55:52.200 --> 55:53.400
How am I looking?

55:53.600 --> 55:54.700
-Yes?
-What l--

55:54.700 --> 55:56.400
-What?
-I don't know.

55:56.600 --> 55:58.000
-What?
-I feel--

55:59.000 --> 56:00.200
You feel funny.

56:00.400 --> 56:03.900
Don't you? Go on, tell me. Go on, tell me.

56:04.100 --> 56:07.000
Don't you think you'd better find
a Catholic girls' refuge?

56:07.100 --> 56:08.300
I'm not a Catholic.

56:08.500 --> 56:11.400
You'll find the address in any ladies' lav,
any railway station.

56:11.500 --> 56:12.900
How do you know?

56:13.000 --> 56:16.500
There was a little piggy
before there was an elephant. That's true.

56:16.700 --> 56:20.100
And this little piggy had two
great big front teeth that stuck out.

56:20.400 --> 56:23.000
However, there are
certain advantages in being big.

56:23.200 --> 56:25.700
You can eat off trees and things,
like horses.

56:25.900 --> 56:28.900
-For you, this is remarkably incoherent.
-Really? Thanks.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.600
This creature got big,
and it grew an enormous, great long jaw.

56:32.900 --> 56:34.800
So that it could scoop up vegetation.

56:34.900 --> 56:37.500
An enormous jaw,
seven-foot-long, you can imagine.

56:37.600 --> 56:38.700
As big as a door.

56:38.800 --> 56:42.500
Now, a seven-foot jaw involves
certain difficulties...

56:42.800 --> 56:45.600
...in getting the food
from the front of the jaw to the back.

56:45.800 --> 56:48.900
It had to use its upper lip
to shovel the garbage along.

56:49.300 --> 56:52.300
-You watching, Colin?
-The upper lip began to grow.

56:52.400 --> 56:54.600
It grew so big it began to do all the work...

56:54.800 --> 56:57.100
...and the creature didn't bother
about the jaw.

56:57.300 --> 56:58.500
As you know--

56:58.600 --> 57:00.600
-Why don't you look at me?
-I can't.

57:00.700 --> 57:02.200
-As you know--
-Why can't you?

57:02.800 --> 57:03.800
What?

57:03.900 --> 57:07.100
As you know,
any organ not in constant use atrophies.

57:07.300 --> 57:10.600
The jaw began to shrivel and shrivel, and....

57:10.900 --> 57:12.400
And so, drop off.

57:13.100 --> 57:15.800
Not that you need worry
about anything like that.

57:15.900 --> 57:17.400
Come on, why?

57:18.700 --> 57:20.300
-Why, then?
-I'll laugh!

57:20.300 --> 57:21.800
-Why?
-You'll make me laugh.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.100
-Why?
-You will.

57:23.200 --> 57:24.500
-Will l?
-Yeah.

57:24.700 --> 57:26.500
Come on, then. Look at me.

57:26.700 --> 57:29.100
Look at me.

57:29.300 --> 57:33.100
Laugh, look at me, laugh, look at me.
Laugh, laugh, laugh.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.300
All right, Colin, she's all yours.

57:37.600 --> 57:39.900
-What?
-You have a try.

57:40.100 --> 57:41.700
-Me?
-Yes.

57:55.500 --> 57:57.600
Has Cardiff got big docks?

57:58.100 --> 58:01.400
-What?
-Has Cardiff got big docks?

58:01.500 --> 58:02.600
-What?
-Welsh.

58:02.800 --> 58:04.000
-Welsh?
-Aren't you?

58:04.100 --> 58:07.900
-Where did you say the YWCA was?
-Wales?

58:08.200 --> 58:09.200
It was the name, "Jones."

58:09.300 --> 58:10.300
Is it far?

58:10.500 --> 58:11.800
-Pardon?
-ls it far?

58:11.800 --> 58:13.000
No, no, not very.

58:13.200 --> 58:15.500
-27 bus.
-I'm off.

58:15.600 --> 58:20.200
And as for you, Mr. "only-one-name,"
Mr. " no-name," as for you....

58:22.700 --> 58:26.500
-My Honey. Give me my Honey.
-You want your magazine?

58:41.900 --> 58:44.300
-You see, it's not difficult.
-That's it!

58:44.500 --> 58:47.400
I need this room, Tolen.
Stay out of this room!

58:47.600 --> 58:50.000
-The bed. Shift the bed.
-Shift it yourself!

58:50.200 --> 58:51.200
We'll shift it.

58:51.300 --> 58:52.900
-You'll shift it!
-Please!

58:53.000 --> 58:55.700
All right, the best place for it
is outside Tolen's room.

58:55.900 --> 58:58.800
-No, please, I want it in my room.
-He wants it shifted!

58:59.100 --> 59:03.400
-What am I gonna sleep on, the stairs?
-Why have you got such a big bed?

59:04.100 --> 59:05.300
Because.

59:07.400 --> 59:10.300
I want another one, that's why.
I wanted another one.

59:10.400 --> 59:12.400
A bigger one. You know.

59:13.200 --> 59:16.400
Because it's more comfortable.
And it's just in case.

59:17.200 --> 59:20.700
And to me, it is very important that I can
always put up my married cousins.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.500
Come on, then.

59:39.500 --> 59:41.100
No one's going to rape you.

59:42.700 --> 59:45.500
No. Girls don't get raped
unless they want it.

59:45.700 --> 59:46.900
Want it?

59:47.400 --> 59:51.300
I'm sorry about what happened.
It was very clumsy.

59:52.100 --> 59:54.500
-That's right.
-lt was because they were here.

59:54.700 --> 59:56.300
The clumsiness, I mean.

59:56.300 --> 59:58.800
-Was it?
-ln a way, yes.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.100
Do you believe me?

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.200
Please, believe me.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.300
-lt doesn't matter.
-lt does matter.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.200
It matters very much.

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.200
It matters very much to me.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.100
How sweet you are.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.500
Such a sweet face. Such sweetness.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:26.700
Come upstairs.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.800
Come.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.600
Come up.

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.600
Come upstairs.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.400
-Where is he?
-Who?

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.700
Tolen.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.300
I've got some records upstairs.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.900
You'll like Thelonious, he's very deep.
Very satisfying.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.600
You'll like his music.

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:53.500
-I'll play you some of his records upstairs.
-Not in my house.

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.300
-What?
-I'll come, too.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.700
-You will?
-I'll come.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.800
-Where?
-To find it.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:58.900
-What?
-The YW.

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.200
Why don't you go and look for the YWCA?

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.200
-You're coming, aren't you?
-Well....

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.900
-Come on.
-What about the cases?

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.400
-Cases?
-I can't go without them.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.800
-He'll look after 'em.
-Who will?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
-He will.
-Me?

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.600
-Where are you going?
-I'm going out.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.600
-Yes, I'd like a walk.
-So would l.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.800
-The cases?
-You stay here.

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.800
Why should l?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
-You could stay here.
-Why?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.300
Who'd look after the cases?

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.400
-He can.
-Who can?

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.900
-Tom can.
-He's got his painting to do.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.900
-Can't they just stay here?
-No, I need them at the YW.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.700
There's no YW up there.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.600
I'm not having my house turned
into a common boarding house.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.100
You don't know what you're coming to,
striding forth.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.500
That's it. The thing is--

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.500
Get those walls clean.
A nice dusty brown throughout.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.500
-And there's no mixing on the stairs.
-Are you coming?

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.400
-To the YW?
-Can't just you and me go?

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.500
-Well--
-Well?

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.800
I don't think I really--

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.100
-You said you did.
-Did l?

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.000
-What about the cases?
-Why don't you go?

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.300
-Me?
-lf you're going, why don't you go?

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500
-Let's go for a walk.
-What about the cases?

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.200
-Why don't you carry them?
-Her?

01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.800
-Yeah.
-She can't carry them.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.500
-She's already carried them here.
-She can't carry them!

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.700
Why don't you carry them?

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.600
-I want both hands free.
-Smooth, dear.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.600
-Where are you going?
-Anywhere.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.300
-Do you want to?
-Do you want me to?

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.800
If you want to, yeah.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.300
-Are you going to the YW?
-Maybe.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.600
-Can I come, too?
-What about the cases?

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.100
What?

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.200
Stay with them, Colin. Stick with them!

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.300
-How does Tolen do it?
-He hasn't, has he, yet?

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.500
-What?
-Done it.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.900
Come on.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.400
-The cases. Come on!
-I'm coming.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.300
Come back! This is bound to end in tears!

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.500
Come back here!

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.800
Stop it. You're touching me. Keep off.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:05.200
Keep off. Do you hear?

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.100
Don't touch me.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.400
All right?

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.300
Now. Now, then.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.900
What is it? What do you want from me?

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.900
What you tryin' on?
What you trying to do?

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:29.000
Smarty mister.
You smart, Mr. Smarty? You think....

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.400
You think you're all right.
You think you're pretty clever.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.400
You do, don't you,
Mr. Smarty, tight trousers?

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.300
Mr. Tight Trousers. Mr. Narrow Slacks.
You think you're the kit, the cat's.

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.300
I'll show you, Mr. Tight Trousers.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.100
Just you don't better come near me,
do you hear?

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:48.900
Just you don't better come near me.
Just you, well, come near me....

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:54.100
Mr. Tight Slacks. Mister....
Come near me. Come near me.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.700
Come near me! Come! Come!

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.899
-Did she--
-I never touched her, did l?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.399
-I knew it'd end like this.
-You know I don't need....

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.300
-How many women have I got?
-Didn't think you'd go this far.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.399
Surprising.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.200
-Well, is she dead?
-Dead?

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:35.300
-She's not.
-It's been my constant fear.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.399
-I knew this would happen one day.
-She's not.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.399
Why not relax, know what I mean?
You're so carried away.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.000
-Feather.
-You know how it is.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.000
-She's not.
-It's happened.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.500
-Did you touch her neck at all?
-No, not round, no.

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:49.000
See if there are marks
of violence around the neck.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.200
I have this fatal knack.

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.899
-Me?
-Contusions.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.000
Me?

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:57.700
I don't like that sort of thing.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.899
-Breathing.
-Warm was she?

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:00.899
That's right.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.399
-Was she breathing?
-I don't know.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.000
At least she's decent now.

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:06.100
-Wasn't she decent before?
-That kind of girl?

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.100
-The pulse is the thing.
-Have you had dealings with the pulse?

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:10.899
-She was disgusting.
-Kiss of life.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.100
She'd enjoy that.

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.100
-You.
-Me?

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.399
-Feel her pulse. You attacked her.
-I did not. Did l?

01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:18.700
-I didn't, did l?
-I didn't, did l?

01:09:18.899 --> 01:09:22.000
I haven't got the knack to make a girl
lie on her back in the rain.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.100
It's not raining.

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.300
The same thing happened
to a friend of mine...

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:26.600
...in Chatham Royal Naval Yard.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.500
Both were wafted away in an ambulance.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.000
-Both?
-You didn't go, Tolen.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.000
Not me. It'd take more than that.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.200
No, he flaked out. He was in the navy.

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:35.899
-Both of them were.
-She's not dead.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.500
Hold it under her nose.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.600
Pulse. I can't find a thing.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Have they got it in the same place as us?

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:45.200
-Feather?
-Perfect. Yes.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.000
-Feel her heart.
-You feel it.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.500
I'll not feel her heart.

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.300
-Tolen!
-Feather, yes.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.100
-She's still warm.
-Doesn't mean a thing.

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.000
-She's not.
-She would be, wouldn't she? Warm.

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:15.800
I've been raped.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.400
Raped.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.600
-Raped.
-Good. She's all right.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.800
-Raped.
-You see? You see what happens?

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.800
I didn't, you know. I did not rape that girl.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.400
-I mean, me? I ask you, now, is it likely?
-Raped.

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.000
-I've had 'em in queues. You've seen.
-Raped.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.400
-Flash birds in all manner of rousy gear.
-Rape!

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:44.100
Lock her up. That's my reaction,
because she can get into trouble.

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.400
-Not me.
-A cup of tea. Hot, sweet tea.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.600
Soon forget her rape nonsense,
and you can get the knack again.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.600
-Rape.
-You don't know the fears.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.200
-It's been my life's fear.
-Get a gag on her and lock her up.

01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.000
My bike. My bleeding tires!

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.600
-She must be stopped.
-That'll have to be pushed.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.200
-They'll be ruined, those tires.
-Stop her.

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:06.700
Rape.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.700
Now, listen, let's talk about this bike.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:09.800
Rape.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.800
-Get out.
-Let me have a word.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:17.800
-Hand. Get.... Good. Back, back.
-Over the.... Hold on, hold on.

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:22.500
-They're almost human, aren't they?
-They're very good.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.000
I hear they're all doped
to make them perform.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.900
-Look at the lovely bears.
-They do look so funny.

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.200
They don't.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.100
Don't leave me.

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:38.900
Ra....

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.400
Just tidying up the park.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.000
Rape.

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.600
-Rape.
-Not today, thank you.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.300
-Rape.
-There she is.

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.600
Rape.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.900
Faster. The four-minute mile.
Get it down to four minutes.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:34.200
Rape.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.800
-Rape.
-My God, my records.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.400
She's breaking your records.
The thing is, you must take it like a man.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.300
Not Thelonious.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.800
Listen. She's stopped.

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:51.100
Now, let's look at this objectively.
Some tea.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.700
You'll feel better after a nice cup of tea,
I'm sure.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.500
I can hear you.
Plotting who's next on the job, aren't you?

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:00.400
I'll get the tea on.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.600
-Now, then.
-Rape.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.700
-My dear girl.
-Rape!

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:04.500
-This all--
-Rape!

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.000
-This is all--
-Rape.

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:09.000
-A fantasy.
-This is all a fantasy.

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:11.900
Rape.

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:16.400
-Starkers. Bare buff.
-Let me see.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.300
-Get back.
-Fantasy.

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:22.000
-She was never raped.
-10 years, and I'll sue you for paternity.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.300
-The tea, the tea.
-Get in there and rape her.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.100
She's got nothing on.

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.700
-Me?
-Right, go on, Tolen.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.600
She wants you to rape her.
That's what it's all about.

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.500
So go in there,
help her out of her little fantasy...

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.100
...and all will be well.

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:39.000
-But why me?
-It's your room.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.700
And you have got the knack.

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.300
-I used to have.
-Satisfy her.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.800
She wants raping,
so go in there and rape her.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.800
I'm not being done twice.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.800
She must be examined now by a confident,
competent physician...

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.700
...now, before she gets raped.

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.200
These persons have raped me.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:02.200
-How do we know?
-You, yeah, before we arrived.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:04.700
You don't believe that, do you?

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:08.500
Very nasty situation here.
Dear me. Yes, very nasty.

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.500
Particularly vicious and so criminal.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.800
Yes, that's it.
Positively criminal. They ought to be told.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.500
Somebody should. I shall phone 'em.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.400
The police, Scotland Yard.
Whitehall, one-two-one-two.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.300
Rape, rape, rape, rape.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.600
Come on, Tolen.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.900
-Why don't you, then?
-lndeed, I can't.

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:28.300
I've got this bone in me leg.

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.400
No, I'd love to help you, but--

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.000
Here, what day is this?
It went clean out of my head.

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.000
I can't get involved raping girls today.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.700
December 8, Albert Hall.
I want my suit.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.600
-What? Your suit?
-Certainly. The mohair. Excuse me.

01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:42.300
Very good. In you go.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.000
And while you're putting it on,
you can help with our....

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.300
Just a minute.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.500
Listen, my girl. Shut up. Now, then....

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.200
Just shut up.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.100
There you are.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.000
I know you've got nothing on
underneath that. Now....

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.400
You need a firm taste of....

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.700
You just listen to me.
I was there all the time.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
And I saw it all, as a matter of fact.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.400
I can assure you that
you have not been raped, as it were.

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.500
You're bound to say that, aren't you?

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.800
Yes. So you can go home and feel intact.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.200
-lt was you.
-Me?

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.200
-lt was you raped me.
-No, no.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:29.600
-You're making a terrible mistake.
-You'll get 10 years. Clothes.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.200
-On. There's a good girl.
-I'll report you. Clothes.

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.100
-Clothes?
-Tore them off me.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.600
-No.
-Where are they, then?

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.100
-Where?
-ln your house.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.400
I can explain.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.100
No one would ever guess.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.400
-Lust.
-That face.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.600
-Lust.
-Little did his pupils think....

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:54.100
-Little did his pupils think,,,
-Shut up!

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:02.400
-And you never can tell, can you?
-That face. No girl would ever suspect.

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.300
-No?
-But underneath, lust.

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.300
No, never.

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.700
Little did his pupils realize
that beneath the handsome exterior...

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.600
...of their tall, fair-haired,
blue-eyed schoolteacher...

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.900
...there lurked the heart of a beast...

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:19.800
...Iusting for the blood of innocent virgins.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.300
Little did they....
You wait'll you see the Sunday 'zette.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.400
Have I really?

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:26.700
What?

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.000
Got a handsome exterior?

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:32.300
Lovely hands.

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.900
All right, love, feeling better?

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:41.000
Come round if you feel like it.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:46.100
Albert Hall. It's informal.
Just a small gathering. A few friends.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:50.600
Women friends.
Rory McBryde and I have many friends.

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:53.400
In a manner of speaking, it's a reunion.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:57.900
Most of our girlfriends will be there,
you know, in the guest book upstairs.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.600
We needed a large hall.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:04.600
Of course, not quite so many as me...

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.500
...but a few.

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:12.700
It's a get-together, you see?
Feeling better now, then?

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.600
You see. Nobody raped you.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.600
And....

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.900
You can get some clothes on, and I'll--

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.500
Colin did her. Raped her.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:26.800
Never.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.100
He's a sexual incompetent.

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.900
-What's that?
-Not good at it.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:35.200
No good?
Get on. He's marvelous. He raped me.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.900
Now, then!
Now, then, you've not been raped.

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.100
-I have.
-Never, no.

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.200
He's rugged.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.200
And handsome.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.400
Now....

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:54.500
Will you come round?

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.500
Get some....
And come round. Have a drink.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.400
I'd like you both to meet Rory,
if you feel like it.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
-Tom.
-And lovely hands.

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:09.300
-And he raped me marvelous-super.
-Now, come on!

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.700
That....

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.600
Why not? Think I couldn't?

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.200
-Yeah.
-Shut up.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.900
Adieu, I am not incapable. No, no.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.300
Go on, out. I'll show you.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:33.400
I didn't really, but I'd love to.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.300
-I mean, I did, didn't l?
-Yes.

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.300
You don't know one end
of a woman from....

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:44.700
Could you fill the Albert Hall?

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.300
It's exaggeration.

01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:01.000
I mean, Rory's got these friends, that's all.
I've got one or two regular.

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.700
Not as many as Rory, but....

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.100
Don't you feel tired?

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.600
I mean, after all that rape?

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.600
I feel, you know....

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:25.500
-No, how do you feel?
-You know, sort of funny.

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:34.500
-Not nervous?
-No.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.700
-Go on.
-What?

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.700
Keep asking me. Ask me what else I feel.

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.800
-Look at me.
-Yes?

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.100
-You make me laugh.
-And me.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.400
Tom, excuse me.

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:04.300
-Colin?
-Upstairs.

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:08.700
Is she moving in?

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:12.000
-I imagine so.
-I see.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.300
Yes.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:22.100
Do you approve of that sort of thing?

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:34.300
Laugh, then.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.900
Laugh?

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.000
Yes, laugh.

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:40.400
Go on.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.800
It would be lovely to see you laugh.

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:55.300
There's a time and place for everything.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:58.300
That's what I always say,
and I always keep my place.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:01.800
This is neither the time nor the place.
Mods and rockers.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.500
I've kept my eyes open
on that washing line.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.600
And it's not all what
you'd expect three lads to wear...

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:10.300
...which makes suspicious reading,
to my way of thinking.

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.400
-She's moving in.
-I'm bound.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.600
-Got the whole idea from television.
-Very bound.

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.800
He's living with her.
I mean, she's moving in.

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:22.100
And not married, either.
They're living together....
