Over 68 million Americans

00:02.492 --> 00:04.923
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:05.242 --> 00:06.346
If danger strikes,

00:07.039 --> 00:09.504
the FBI's International Response Team

00:09.674 --> 00:11.253
is called into action.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.696
_

01:20.892 --> 01:24.394
Felicia, you... how do you
say in America, really rock?

01:24.396 --> 01:26.830
Are you kidding? You
girls are the ones who rock.

01:26.832 --> 01:28.598
You dance beautifully.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.533
I'm just trying to keep up with you all.

01:30.535 --> 01:33.236
She's right. You dance
pretty good for a girl

01:33.238 --> 01:34.704
with such big feet.

01:34.706 --> 01:36.239
I'm surprised.

01:36.241 --> 01:38.541
_

01:39.234 --> 01:41.062
_

01:41.133 --> 01:42.133
_

01:42.714 --> 01:44.581
I suggest you focus on dance.

01:44.583 --> 01:47.050
The recital is four days away,

01:47.052 --> 01:49.552
and the world will be watching.

02:15.247 --> 02:16.646
Hello?

02:21.053 --> 02:22.218
Who's there?

02:27.059 --> 02:28.958
Felicia.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.696
Ha ha. I see you,

02:32.698 --> 02:36.166
but I don't scare that easily, so...

02:36.168 --> 02:39.169
enough with the games.

03:01.193 --> 03:04.027
Aah!

03:06.178 --> 03:07.811
The deeper my cover, the safer I am.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.313
Well, you don't think they're gonna try

03:09.315 --> 03:11.148
- and board the plane, do you?
- He's your problem now.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.917
- Try to focus!
- Stay with me! Come on!

03:13.919 --> 03:15.548
I'm here to help you!

03:17.390 --> 03:19.289
I'm asking you to see
me as a fellow agent,

03:19.291 --> 03:20.524
not as your son.

03:20.526 --> 03:22.025
Captain, they've got us surrounded.

03:35.207 --> 03:36.573
Morning.

03:36.575 --> 03:39.576
Oh, looks like someone's on
the struggle bus this mornin'.

03:39.578 --> 03:41.612
Oh, I could never sleep on planes.

03:41.614 --> 03:43.747
Yeah, well, get in
line. I was up all night.

03:43.749 --> 03:44.529
Work?

03:44.591 --> 03:47.117
Yeah, if you consider
shoe shopping online work.

03:47.119 --> 03:48.919
Can't wait to get home.

03:48.921 --> 03:51.655
Yeah, I know. I missed the boys'
Little League game yesterday.

03:51.657 --> 03:52.956
Mm.

03:52.958 --> 03:54.458
Sorry, bud. That's tough.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.427
How did you do it all these years, Jack?

03:56.429 --> 03:58.629
Easy. Like you, I just married up.

03:58.631 --> 04:00.097
Good morning, everyone.

04:00.099 --> 04:02.566
- Morning, Monty.
- Ah, Clara.

04:02.568 --> 04:04.334
Just the girl I was looking for.

04:04.336 --> 04:05.702
How's your Russian these days?

04:05.704 --> 04:07.104
_

04:07.106 --> 04:10.441
Good, 'cause the plane's being
rerouted to St. Petersburg.

04:10.443 --> 04:12.309
Felicia Pope, 16, from Houston, Texas,

04:12.311 --> 04:14.144
has gone missing from the Mishinsky Ballet.

04:14.146 --> 04:16.079
American at the Mishinsky?

04:16.081 --> 04:18.548
Wow. She must have been super talented.

04:18.551 --> 04:20.617
First ever. She had the lead
in the annual performance

04:20.619 --> 04:22.019
of Arlekinada.

04:22.021 --> 04:25.289
Wow, the Harlequin dance.
That is a beautiful ballet,

04:25.291 --> 04:27.458
despite the very creepy clown in it.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.460
- Uh, let me guess.
- Oh, yeah, you know it.

04:29.462 --> 04:30.627
Ballet since I was three.

04:30.629 --> 04:32.062
Don't make me get up
on my toes and show you.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.131
In a time when Russia
and the United States

04:34.133 --> 04:35.966
are not exactly BFFs... Here you go.

04:35.968 --> 04:37.401
Oh. Thank you.

04:37.403 --> 04:39.703
Uh, offer diplomacy through the arts.

04:39.705 --> 04:42.506
Seems like it was working,
too, and getting a lot of press.

04:42.508 --> 04:44.174
The show was four days away,

04:44.176 --> 04:47.544
and Felicia was on the brink of
becoming an international star.

04:47.546 --> 04:50.981
So did someone resent Felicia's
position in the ballet?

04:50.983 --> 04:52.716
Some of the other dancers did report

04:52.718 --> 04:55.252
that Felicia's understudy,
Samantha Mironov, 15,

04:55.254 --> 04:57.454
was not happy about
Felicia getting the role.

04:57.456 --> 04:59.122
But enough to kidnap or kill her?

04:59.124 --> 05:00.657
I mean, anything's possible.

05:00.659 --> 05:03.594
I've heard crazy
stories of choreographers

05:03.596 --> 05:06.763
who have been brutally attacked
by their dancers and sponsors

05:06.765 --> 05:08.465
for creative differences.

05:08.467 --> 05:10.467
Felicia was last seen at rehearsal

05:10.469 --> 05:12.302
by the other dancers and
their choreographer, Dado,

05:12.304 --> 05:14.505
- who reported her missing.
- And her parents?

05:14.507 --> 05:17.541
Parent. Uh, her
mom, Lisa, is on her way.

05:17.543 --> 05:19.109
Seems Dad was never
really in the picture,

05:19.111 --> 05:20.390
but I'll get more information
when she gets here.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.846
So the Russians are letting
us operate an investigation

05:22.848 --> 05:24.882
- on their soil?
- Felicia's disappearance

05:24.884 --> 05:26.404
is only known by the two
countries at the moment,

05:26.459 --> 05:28.218
but if Felicia isn't found soon,

05:28.220 --> 05:29.686
her understudy will have to step in,

05:29.688 --> 05:31.482
and then the world will
start asking questions.

05:31.488 --> 05:33.156
So if this does get out,

05:33.158 --> 05:34.992
and the Kremlin doesn't
invite us to participate

05:34.994 --> 05:37.261
in the investigation, it will appear

05:37.263 --> 05:39.429
that they're hiding something.

05:39.431 --> 05:40.731
Oh, I wish I had more for you,

05:40.733 --> 05:42.399
but information from the Kremlin

05:42.401 --> 05:44.268
has been spotty at best.

05:44.270 --> 05:46.436
Well, I wouldn't expect
them to be helpful.

05:46.438 --> 05:49.406
It's hard to change decades of secrecy,

05:49.408 --> 05:52.132
and the Russians view everything
as an international chess game.

05:52.171 --> 05:54.211
No, this isn't a time for games.

05:54.213 --> 05:56.113
Teenage girl's life
hangs in the balance,

05:56.115 --> 05:57.681
we gotta find her and get her back

05:57.683 --> 05:59.116
before she's lost forever.

06:07.159 --> 06:10.260
Hello?

06:10.262 --> 06:12.029
Is anyone there?

06:14.967 --> 06:18.335
Where am I?

06:18.337 --> 06:20.070
What's happening?

06:36.011 --> 06:39.277
Criminal Minds Beyond Borders
Series Finale 2x13

06:42.714 --> 06:46.781
Synced and corrected by Dragoniod for
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:55.123 --> 06:57.134
A Russian proverb tells us,

06:57.183 --> 06:59.383
If you're scared of the wolves,

06:59.713 --> 07:01.846
stay out of the forest.

07:06.086 --> 07:08.219
I've just been informed
the Kremlin has sent us

07:08.221 --> 07:09.254
a welcoming party.

07:09.256 --> 07:11.222
Seems so.

07:11.224 --> 07:13.158
Well, they should just
call it the K.G.B. still.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.926
It's the same people, same M.O.

07:14.928 --> 07:17.595
- It's gonna be a tricky dance.
- It will be.

07:17.597 --> 07:18.963
The ambassador informed me,

07:18.965 --> 07:21.700
no guns, no badges, or identification.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.601
So we're invisible?

07:23.603 --> 07:26.037
Yep. Everyone follow my lead.

07:34.481 --> 07:38.550
Welcome. I'm Major
General Galina Glazunov.

07:38.552 --> 07:39.851
I welcome you to Russia.

07:39.853 --> 07:41.953
I'm Unit Chief Jack
Garrett, and this is my team,

07:41.955 --> 07:44.522
Agent Seger, Simmons, and Jarvis.

07:44.524 --> 07:46.791
Agent Garrett, this
is a diplomatic event

07:46.793 --> 07:48.393
taking place on Russian soil.

07:48.395 --> 07:51.529
You and your team will
respect my authority.

07:51.531 --> 07:53.264
Our only mission is finding Felicia Pope

07:53.266 --> 07:54.119
and bringing her home.

07:54.165 --> 07:55.734
If you or your team make one false move,

07:55.736 --> 07:58.570
I will not hesitate to
declare you persona non grata.

07:58.572 --> 08:00.171
Do we understand each other?

08:00.173 --> 08:01.539
We do.

08:01.541 --> 08:02.807
_

08:02.809 --> 08:05.510
Then we will escort you
to the Mishinsky Theater,

08:05.512 --> 08:07.412
where the American girl was last seen.

08:20.861 --> 08:21.960
Please...

08:21.962 --> 08:25.797
Eeny-meeny-miny-mo.

08:26.933 --> 08:31.403
Catch a piggy by the toe.

08:31.405 --> 08:34.038
If she screams...

08:34.039 --> 08:35.073
Please!

08:35.075 --> 08:37.708
... let her go.

08:38.578 --> 08:44.048
Eeny-meeny-miny...

08:44.049 --> 08:45.817
mo.

08:46.853 --> 08:48.052
Aah!

08:50.424 --> 08:53.358
This is where Felicia was last seen.

08:54.327 --> 08:56.544
No obvious signs of a struggle.

08:56.550 --> 09:00.131
No, but maybe the
assailant or assailants

09:00.133 --> 09:02.500
were able to disable Felicia quickly

09:02.502 --> 09:04.569
before she could put up a fight.

09:06.239 --> 09:10.008
In a space this open,
no one saw anything?

09:12.279 --> 09:14.446
Maybe someone did.

09:28.495 --> 09:30.295
Who installs security cameras,

09:30.297 --> 09:32.597
then points them away from the action?

09:32.599 --> 09:35.633
Whoever did this aimed
them that way deliberately.

09:35.635 --> 09:37.936
Someone familiar with the theater.

09:37.938 --> 09:39.604
Surprised the Russian Politsiya

09:39.606 --> 09:40.772
didn't clock this.

09:40.774 --> 09:42.173
Well, they might have.. but

09:42.175 --> 09:45.210
decided not to share
the information with us.

09:47.047 --> 09:50.715
Whoever turned these around
was definitely using gloves.

09:50.717 --> 09:53.151
Our UnSub is organized.

09:53.153 --> 09:55.954
Probably enters through
the roof up there.

09:55.956 --> 09:58.389
Then climbs down from here.

09:58.391 --> 09:59.591
That keeps him well away

09:59.593 --> 10:00.825
from the main doors of the building

10:00.827 --> 10:03.595
which also are monitored
by security cameras.

10:03.597 --> 10:06.998
He had a plan to get in,

10:07.000 --> 10:08.867
to get out,

10:08.869 --> 10:11.202
and to cover his tracks.

10:14.274 --> 10:16.875
The eye can see it, but
the tooth can't bite it?

10:16.877 --> 10:18.910
You know what this means, yes?

10:19.846 --> 10:22.347
One's reach exceeds one's grasp.

10:22.349 --> 10:25.183
Da. This what happen to Felicia.

10:25.185 --> 10:27.418
She gets scared, then runs.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.988
Felicia traveled here by
herself to pursue her dreams.

10:29.990 --> 10:31.823
This really doesn't sound like
somebody who would run away.

10:31.825 --> 10:33.758
Aren't you her understudy?

10:33.760 --> 10:35.627
Mother Russia wants to show the world

10:35.629 --> 10:39.430
it can play nice, so the
role I train my whole life for

10:39.432 --> 10:40.698
goes to an American.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.967
Ooh, so Felicia's sudden absence

10:42.969 --> 10:45.270
brings quite an opportunity for you.

10:45.272 --> 10:49.440
I see it more like... destiny.

10:51.111 --> 10:52.944
Excuse me, Dado.

10:54.314 --> 10:55.780
Hi.

10:55.782 --> 10:57.215
SSA Mae Jarvis.

10:57.217 --> 10:58.883
Do you mind if I ask
you a few questions?

10:58.885 --> 11:00.585
So my understanding is that

11:00.587 --> 11:02.120
you're not just the choreographer

11:02.122 --> 11:03.988
but you're also dancing the male lead.

11:03.990 --> 11:06.624
Yes. I play the Harlequin.

11:06.626 --> 11:09.027
This is not uncommon in Russian ballet.

11:09.029 --> 11:11.763
And why did you choose
Felicia for the female lead?

11:11.765 --> 11:13.665
Because she's the best
dancer in the company.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.466
Of course.

11:15.468 --> 11:18.503
So where did you go last
night after you left the stage?

11:18.505 --> 11:21.739
I went out... to the movies.

11:21.741 --> 11:23.841
Can anyone confirm that?

11:24.811 --> 11:26.511
Did you kidnap or kill Felicia?

11:26.513 --> 11:28.479
- Nyet.
- Do you know where she is?

11:28.481 --> 11:30.114
Nyet!

11:33.386 --> 11:36.454
Where did you go after you
left Felicia on the stage?

11:36.456 --> 11:37.689
My room.

11:37.691 --> 11:39.791
Really? So if I question your roommate,

11:39.793 --> 11:41.759
she'll back that up?

11:41.761 --> 11:43.828
Something wrong, Dado?

11:45.966 --> 11:49.033
I was with someone.

11:49.035 --> 11:51.636
But I rather not say who.

11:51.638 --> 11:54.072
Because it incriminates you
in Felicia's disappearance?

11:55.108 --> 11:57.008
Because it hurts my reputation.

11:57.010 --> 11:58.776
Yeah, well, you're not
gonna have much of one

11:58.778 --> 12:00.678
if you're sitting in jail rotting.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.247
Where were you the night
Felicia disappeared?

12:04.618 --> 12:06.317
Okay, let me be clear.

12:06.319 --> 12:07.852
If you do not have a solid alibi,

12:07.854 --> 12:09.721
I will have that agent
out there come inside

12:09.723 --> 12:10.922
and arrest you.

12:10.924 --> 12:12.357
I did nothing wrong.

12:12.359 --> 12:14.792
What did you do, Samantha?

12:14.794 --> 12:16.361
I was with Samantha.

12:16.363 --> 12:17.929
The understudy.

12:17.931 --> 12:19.831
So your alibi is that
you were at the movies

12:19.833 --> 12:20.999
with an underage girl?

12:21.001 --> 12:23.067
It's different here in Russia.

12:23.069 --> 12:24.836
I broke no laws.

12:24.838 --> 12:27.705
Though people talking
is not good for me.

12:28.842 --> 12:31.242
I know you may not find this proper.

12:31.244 --> 12:34.345
This proves that I have nothing to do

12:34.347 --> 12:37.281
with Felicia's disappearance.

12:39.552 --> 12:41.526
The more we know about Felicia,

12:41.573 --> 12:43.454
the better our chances of finding her.

12:43.456 --> 12:44.689
Well...

12:44.691 --> 12:47.792
She just started dancing
again a few months ago.

12:47.794 --> 12:48.840
What happened?

12:48.903 --> 12:53.431
She had a major operation on
a torn ligament in her toe.

12:53.433 --> 12:58.202
The doctors said she'd
need six months to recover,

12:58.204 --> 13:00.872
and in six weeks, she
was back on the stage.

13:00.874 --> 13:02.640
So she's very driven.

13:02.642 --> 13:05.810
Yes... and passionate.

13:05.812 --> 13:08.713
She just loves dance.

13:08.715 --> 13:11.049
Needs it like we need air.

13:11.051 --> 13:14.919
I was torn about letting her
go so far away without me,

13:14.921 --> 13:18.423
but I couldn't stop her
from doing what she loved.

13:18.425 --> 13:21.492
Were there any friends, boyfriends?

13:21.494 --> 13:25.569
No time for that. Her life is dance.

13:25.655 --> 13:29.867
Well, did she say anything
about her time in Russia, then?

13:31.438 --> 13:34.639
Just everything was like it usually is.

13:34.641 --> 13:38.009
Some girls are fun,
some girls not so much.

13:38.011 --> 13:40.578
But nothing out of the ordinary,

13:40.580 --> 13:43.114
except, of course,
all the Internet hate.

13:43.116 --> 13:46.050
I saw that. It was really cruel,

13:46.052 --> 13:47.832
but nothing that would suggest danger.

13:47.902 --> 13:50.088
Maybe not with the public stuff,

13:50.090 --> 13:52.590
but you should see the private.

13:52.592 --> 13:54.292
There were a lot of unhappy people

13:54.294 --> 13:57.428
about her being an American
in a Russian ballet.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.633
Wow.

14:04.237 --> 14:07.038
Did... she or you report any of this?

14:07.040 --> 14:09.907
All Felicia wants to do is dance.

14:09.909 --> 14:12.844
She doesn't care about any of that.

14:16.688 --> 14:19.250
My men have shared with me
your interviews and theories,

14:19.252 --> 14:21.352
and we believe that
not everyone is ready

14:21.354 --> 14:22.720
to handle such pressure.

14:22.722 --> 14:24.155
The girl probably ran away.

14:24.157 --> 14:25.890
What little we know about her profile

14:25.892 --> 14:28.159
- suggests something different.
- Profile?

14:28.161 --> 14:29.761
Yes. We believe that every crime...

14:29.763 --> 14:32.430
Da, I know what this psychobabble means...

14:32.432 --> 14:35.399
but it is not our way.

14:37.737 --> 14:39.871
- What do you got, Monty?
- Felicia's mom gave me access

14:39.873 --> 14:41.606
to all of her social media and e-mails.

14:41.608 --> 14:43.107
Now before she got
the part in the ballet,

14:43.109 --> 14:45.276
she had 120 followers. Two days after,

14:45.278 --> 14:46.644
she had 100,000,

14:46.646 --> 14:49.080
- along with love letters, hate mail...
- Spasiba.

14:49.082 --> 14:51.082
... and threats and
some Photoshopped pics

14:51.084 --> 14:52.383
I wish I could unsee.

14:52.385 --> 14:53.985
You think an obsessed fan did this?

14:53.987 --> 14:55.179
Wouldn't be the first time.

14:55.235 --> 14:58.170
Celebrity stalking is a common
obsessive addictive behavior.

14:58.172 --> 15:00.339
And if you pair a fanatical
emotional attachment

15:00.341 --> 15:02.274
with an underlying
psychological disorder,

15:02.276 --> 15:04.176
that's an explosive combination.

15:04.178 --> 15:05.200
- We know the UnSub is

15:05.240 --> 15:06.408
organized and knowledgeable.

15:06.413 --> 15:08.647
He knew where the security cameras were

15:08.649 --> 15:09.948
and how to avoid them.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.650
He was also familiar with the victim...

15:11.652 --> 15:12.918
or at least he thought he was.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.320
He's also confident enough
in his not getting caught

15:15.322 --> 15:16.888
that he was able to get close...

15:20.394 --> 15:22.828
_

15:22.830 --> 15:24.596
Whoever did this was just here.

15:24.598 --> 15:28.233
Lock it down!

15:36.545 --> 15:38.277
That is a very brazen thing to do.

15:38.315 --> 15:40.882
Well, it speaks to their
confidence in not being caught.

15:40.915 --> 15:42.793
Or their desire to send us a message

15:42.837 --> 15:44.195
they can get this close to us.

15:44.312 --> 15:46.145
Or is that toe proof of life?

15:46.147 --> 15:48.047
It could be a warning.

15:48.049 --> 15:49.248
Felicia's medical history

15:49.250 --> 15:51.450
said that she had an
operation on her toe.

15:51.452 --> 15:53.385
And her scar would have
been just like this one.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.354
Yeah, this looks like it was bitten off,

15:55.356 --> 15:56.822
like an animal did this.

15:56.824 --> 15:59.191
The bite is human size,
but the tears are symmetrical.

15:59.193 --> 16:01.594
And even perfect teeth
are not that straight.

16:01.596 --> 16:02.895
So what could have done that?

16:02.897 --> 16:04.997
A biting device.

16:06.634 --> 16:09.435
Years ago, I unofficially
worked an international case

16:09.437 --> 16:12.137
where the UnSub would capture
and torture his victims

16:12.139 --> 16:15.941
by tearing off bits and pieces
of their bodies using a...

16:15.943 --> 16:18.010
a metal fang device that he created.

16:18.012 --> 16:19.178
Hmm. Lovely.

16:19.180 --> 16:22.982
His name was Oleg
Antakov, ex-K.G.B. agent

16:22.984 --> 16:25.050
who was the head interrogator

16:25.052 --> 16:27.019
of a secret torture house in Riga.

16:27.021 --> 16:28.988
They called him The Ripper of Riga.

16:28.990 --> 16:30.856
Ex-K.G.B.?

16:30.858 --> 16:33.359
Yeah. When Russia
fell, so did the K.G.B.,

16:33.361 --> 16:36.395
but Oleg... he never stopped.

16:36.397 --> 16:38.364
He kept capturing and torturing people.

16:38.366 --> 16:39.765
Instead of information,

16:39.767 --> 16:42.801
it was for his pure
desire to see them suffer.

16:42.803 --> 16:44.970
So is this a copycat
or the Ripper himself?

16:44.972 --> 16:47.740
They locked him up and
threw away the key, but...

16:47.742 --> 16:50.309
whoever this is wants
us to know they're here.

16:50.311 --> 16:51.938
Anyone see who handed out the teas?

16:52.055 --> 16:54.280
Uh, it was someone in white.

16:54.282 --> 16:55.648
The kitchen staff.

16:55.650 --> 16:57.082
_

16:57.084 --> 16:59.285
Clara, you and the team go with Galina.

16:59.287 --> 17:02.221
- I'm gonna try another angle.
- Where do you think you're going?

17:03.357 --> 17:05.257
To visit the past.

17:05.259 --> 17:07.059
_

17:19.906 --> 17:22.907
Wow, that's a lot of
security for a kitchen.

17:22.910 --> 17:25.577
This is Russia. We have
security everywhere.

17:25.579 --> 17:28.681
Do you have any record of
who came in and out of here?

17:28.683 --> 17:31.016
Six people have keyed
in or out of the kitchen

17:31.018 --> 17:32.418
over the last hour.

17:32.420 --> 17:33.429
Four remain in the building.

17:33.476 --> 17:35.788
- Man, you guys are efficient.
- Da.

17:35.790 --> 17:37.756
Well, let's round them up
and try to find the others.

17:37.758 --> 17:39.101
While Monty runs the names.

17:45.333 --> 17:46.732
Hello, Boris.

17:46.734 --> 17:49.802
Jack! It's been too long, my old friend.

17:50.938 --> 17:53.105
_

17:53.107 --> 17:55.671
Before I give you spanking.

17:55.757 --> 17:58.110
Welcome back to Russia.

17:58.112 --> 17:59.945
How is my girl?

17:59.947 --> 18:01.413
Karen is good.

18:01.415 --> 18:02.777
Let's drink to that.

18:02.816 --> 18:04.230
No, thanks. I'm working.

18:04.309 --> 18:07.277
Still a Boy Scout, I see.

18:07.279 --> 18:09.879
The Ripper is back.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.481
What?

18:11.483 --> 18:13.983
Nyet.

18:13.985 --> 18:16.953
He is still in hole we left him in.

18:16.955 --> 18:19.923
An American ballet dancer is missing.

18:19.925 --> 18:22.959
We just found her toe. It was bitten off

18:22.961 --> 18:24.694
by some kind of device.

18:24.696 --> 18:26.129
It's impossible.

18:26.131 --> 18:29.065
Only a small group knew his M.O.,

18:29.067 --> 18:31.367
and most of them are now dead.

18:31.369 --> 18:34.137
Then either he's out,

18:34.139 --> 18:36.506
or you or I did it.

18:36.508 --> 18:40.243
I think it's time we
pay the Ripper a visit.

18:40.245 --> 18:42.412
Okay, Monty, what do you got?

18:42.414 --> 18:44.013
Of the two employees
who left the theater,

18:44.015 --> 18:45.248
one name rang a bell,

18:45.250 --> 18:47.217
so I ran a search of his
mug from his work badge

18:47.219 --> 18:49.385
against all of Felicia's followers,

18:49.387 --> 18:50.653
and I got a hit.

18:50.655 --> 18:52.255
His name is Ivan Kozar.

18:52.257 --> 18:55.091
Now Kozar was one of
Felicia's obsessive followers.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.227
He made over 2,000
posts about her online.

18:57.229 --> 18:58.928
Well, I know they call them fanatics,

18:58.930 --> 19:00.797
but doesn't hurting
the object of obsession

19:00.799 --> 19:02.498
seem a little extreme?

19:02.500 --> 19:04.067
Yeah, if Felicia said or did something

19:04.069 --> 19:06.502
that Kozar thought was wrong,
it may have triggered him.

19:06.504 --> 19:08.104
Like taking a role from a Russian

19:08.106 --> 19:09.505
in the Mishinsky Ballet?

19:09.507 --> 19:12.508
Because that's when his posts
from loving to trashing her.

19:12.510 --> 19:13.710
Yeah, but what does Kozar have to do

19:13.712 --> 19:15.211
with the guy that Jack is looking into?

19:15.213 --> 19:16.412
How are they connected?

19:16.414 --> 19:19.315
It doesn't matter.
We've got his address.

19:19.317 --> 19:20.817
Follow me.

19:22.454 --> 19:26.222
All right, thanks, Clara.
Be careful. Keep me updated.

19:26.224 --> 19:28.424
We must check phones, Jack.

19:28.426 --> 19:31.060
Karasho.

19:33.331 --> 19:35.879
Clara said they got a
suspect they're checking out.

19:35.910 --> 19:38.334
How can suspect know
anything about Ripper?

19:38.336 --> 19:40.703
We're about to find out.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.781
What is this place?

19:51.783 --> 19:54.851
This where things go to disappear.

20:17.642 --> 20:19.776
Da.

20:19.778 --> 20:23.112
Old friends come to
visit... It warms the heart.

20:25.116 --> 20:29.085
You two must be in real
trouble, you come down here.

20:29.087 --> 20:31.587
We have some questions for you.

20:31.589 --> 20:33.089
Of course you do.

20:33.091 --> 20:36.125
Please, come and make
yourself comfortable.

20:36.127 --> 20:38.962
- Have a seat.
- No, Thank you.

20:40.065 --> 20:42.765
I'm not giving you a choice.

20:42.767 --> 20:46.069
You need me, not other way around.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.376
_

20:55.747 --> 20:57.513
If he so much as yawns,

20:57.515 --> 20:59.549
shoot him.

20:59.551 --> 21:01.551
_

21:18.937 --> 21:22.238
This is why I hate clowns.

21:24.009 --> 21:25.975
So this is the clown from the show.

21:25.977 --> 21:27.710
Yeah, but why?

21:27.712 --> 21:29.412
Does it symbolize
something for this UnSub

21:29.414 --> 21:31.047
or mean something?

21:31.049 --> 21:33.149
Might mean like the joke's on you?

21:33.151 --> 21:35.518
Maybe the UnSub wanted the last laugh.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.328
If you find one that
you like, it is yours.

21:48.767 --> 21:51.667
We are not so different, Boris.

21:51.669 --> 21:54.537
- You're a monster.
- I am not.

21:54.539 --> 21:56.472
That's funny.

21:56.474 --> 21:58.708
One day, I am hero.

21:58.710 --> 22:01.411
Medals, dinners.

22:01.413 --> 22:03.413
My picture in newspaper.

22:03.415 --> 22:07.350
And then... Ronald Reagan,

22:07.352 --> 22:09.152
and now I am monster

22:09.154 --> 22:10.486
with no rights.

22:15.126 --> 22:17.226
You were necessary evil.

22:17.228 --> 22:20.063
This is why you're in this cage.

22:20.065 --> 22:22.999
Do you believe this true, Agent Garrett?

22:23.001 --> 22:25.968
That every law in the world was broken

22:25.970 --> 22:28.838
when you and this relic put me in here?

22:28.840 --> 22:31.007
There was no trial,

22:31.009 --> 22:32.875
no jury.

22:32.877 --> 22:35.478
I thought America stood for justice.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.013
Where is mine?

22:37.015 --> 22:39.849
Well, Oleg, you're in Russia.

22:39.851 --> 22:41.417
That's between you and your country.

22:41.419 --> 22:43.753
Ha ha! That is what you tell yourself

22:43.755 --> 22:47.423
to sleep better at night,
but at least you sleep.

22:47.425 --> 22:50.293
This one is too busy drinking vodka

22:50.295 --> 22:52.829
and chasing me in his dreams.

22:52.831 --> 22:54.964
You don't know what
you're talking about.

22:54.966 --> 22:58.101
No? You caught your white whale.

22:58.103 --> 22:59.635
Huh.

22:59.637 --> 23:04.507
But you cannot tell anyone
about me or him, so...

23:04.509 --> 23:07.810
in K.G.B., you are
nothing but paper pusher.

23:07.812 --> 23:08.978
He's baiting you.

23:08.980 --> 23:11.714
Is working.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.450
Over here!

23:14.452 --> 23:15.952
A girl is missing.

23:15.954 --> 23:18.754
A ballerina. The M.O. screams you.

23:18.756 --> 23:21.090
I am flattered,

23:21.092 --> 23:22.725
but as you can see,

23:22.727 --> 23:25.128
that is impossible unless
there are two of me.

23:25.130 --> 23:27.430
Or you got someone else
to do your dirty work.

23:27.432 --> 23:29.999
Well, that would take
some kind of magic trick

23:30.001 --> 23:31.868
from down here,

23:31.870 --> 23:34.670
but if I was involved,

23:34.672 --> 23:37.473
I would choose victim like dancer.

23:37.475 --> 23:39.075
High-profile American

23:39.077 --> 23:41.944
that would get the attention of the FBI.

23:43.014 --> 23:45.314
And then I would leave trail of crumbs.

23:45.316 --> 23:48.651
Huh. Or maybe a toe.

23:49.821 --> 23:53.256
And then I would lead team to a patsy...

23:53.258 --> 23:56.159
or actually a patsy's apartment

23:56.161 --> 23:58.528
where everything would go boom.

24:00.498 --> 24:02.064
_

24:02.066 --> 24:03.599
Felicia.

24:03.601 --> 24:04.967
Felicia, we're here to help you.

24:08.373 --> 24:09.305
Come on!

24:10.441 --> 24:12.775
Jack? Clara, get out of there now!

24:12.777 --> 24:13.910
It's a trap!

24:13.912 --> 24:15.878
No! Stop!

24:26.348 --> 24:28.009
I'm just getting the glass.

24:29.770 --> 24:31.653
Felicia?

24:33.255 --> 24:34.888
I'm an American with the IRT.

24:35.020 --> 24:36.453
I'm here to help you.

24:36.455 --> 24:38.188
Just relax. Everything's
gonna be all right.

24:39.291 --> 24:40.657
- Jack.
- Clara.

24:40.659 --> 24:42.792
I heard the explosion. Is everyone okay?

24:42.794 --> 24:44.261
Two F.S.B. agents are down.

24:44.263 --> 24:46.396
- Simmons is hurt.
- How bad?

24:46.398 --> 24:48.198
He took a pretty good hit.
I think he's gonna be okay.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.432
You and Mae?

24:49.434 --> 24:51.001
We're lucky to be alive.

24:51.003 --> 24:53.069
It's a miracle that
we just survived that.

24:53.071 --> 24:54.604
What about the suspect?

24:54.606 --> 24:57.581
In the wind, but we do have
Felicia, and she's alive.

24:57.675 --> 24:59.476
Jack! Jack!

24:59.478 --> 25:01.978
Man whose apartment that
they go to is Ivan Kozar.

25:01.980 --> 25:04.381
He's part-time guard
here at Erdeli Prison.

25:04.383 --> 25:05.849
Oleg was an interrogator.

25:05.851 --> 25:07.450
He knows how to get
something out of someone

25:07.452 --> 25:09.219
and to get them to do his bidding.

25:09.221 --> 25:11.855
He turned his guard and
he used him to set trap

25:11.857 --> 25:13.089
that we fell right into.

25:13.091 --> 25:14.724
If he can turn a guard...

25:36.248 --> 25:38.381
We were a distraction.

25:38.383 --> 25:40.617
Killed them and got the
drop on the other guards

25:40.619 --> 25:42.485
before they had time to react.

25:42.487 --> 25:45.021
But he could do this anytime
with guard Ivan. Why now?

25:45.023 --> 25:47.424
Because it's personal. We were set up.

25:47.426 --> 25:49.826
He wanted us to be responsible.

25:49.828 --> 25:51.728
And responsible you are!

25:57.836 --> 26:00.403
What is this?

26:04.977 --> 26:06.509
Come with me.

26:06.511 --> 26:07.744
What is... what is...

26:07.746 --> 26:09.779
Hey. Hey, hey, what is going on?

26:09.781 --> 26:12.248
I have two dead agents. I
got a killer on the loose,

26:12.250 --> 26:14.751
and the one thing they
have in common is your team.

26:14.753 --> 26:16.386
Time to go home.

26:18.824 --> 26:21.891
The Kremlin says this is for
your own protection, Jack.

26:21.893 --> 26:23.660
Oh, come on, that's
bull, and you know it.

26:23.662 --> 26:26.529
We can't afford to have any
more Americans getting hurt.

26:26.531 --> 26:28.298
Or fixing your problems.

26:28.300 --> 26:31.167
It's out of my hands, Jack.

26:38.110 --> 26:39.676
How you doing, Matt?

26:39.678 --> 26:42.646
Some cuts and bruises, but I'll be okay.

26:43.715 --> 26:45.482
Felicia okay?

26:45.484 --> 26:48.151
Happy and grateful to be alive.

26:49.988 --> 26:51.688
I love you.

26:51.690 --> 26:53.056
I love you, too.

26:58.363 --> 27:00.463
Soon as I suspected it was the Ripper,

27:00.465 --> 27:02.766
I should have known
what he was gonna do.

27:02.768 --> 27:05.068
He's planned this out for years, Jack.

27:05.070 --> 27:06.302
I looked into Ivan.

27:06.304 --> 27:08.304
He lost his father as a young boy.

27:08.306 --> 27:09.939
He's been searching for
a purpose ever since.

27:09.941 --> 27:11.975
So Oleg filled that mentor role,

27:11.977 --> 27:13.410
gave him something to believe in...

27:13.412 --> 27:14.878
Revenge for his father figure.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.813
Exactly. Oleg bided his time

27:16.815 --> 27:19.416
until the opportunity showed itself.

27:19.418 --> 27:20.717
That's a long play,

27:20.719 --> 27:22.452
which is why you need to see this.

27:22.454 --> 27:25.822
It was found amongst the
rubble at Ivan's apartment.

27:28.326 --> 27:29.626
How did he get this?

27:29.628 --> 27:31.494
An old K.G.B. agent like Oleg

27:31.496 --> 27:34.097
knows where everything is
buried and how to find it.

27:34.099 --> 27:35.265
Yeah, but how did F.S.B. get

27:35.267 --> 27:36.966
all of this personal stuff about you?

27:38.870 --> 27:40.537
I'm sorry, Jack, but the Kremlin

27:40.539 --> 27:43.573
wants you and your team airborne ASAP.

27:43.575 --> 27:46.176
This your handiwork?

27:50.515 --> 27:53.550
So every time you stayed
with us in our home,

27:53.552 --> 27:55.385
you were spying on me?

27:55.387 --> 27:58.888
What? You think the Cold War was over?

27:58.890 --> 28:01.758
I did not tell Kremlin
anything more about you

28:01.760 --> 28:03.359
than you tell Washington about me.

28:03.361 --> 28:05.462
I only gave them the bare essentials,

28:05.464 --> 28:08.565
never, ever anything about your
personal life or your family.

28:10.802 --> 28:12.368
Wait.

28:12.370 --> 28:14.804
That's it.

28:14.806 --> 28:16.639
Oleg blames me for getting caught,

28:16.641 --> 28:17.907
so in order to hurt me,

28:17.909 --> 28:20.443
he made it seem like he
was gonna hurt my team,

28:20.445 --> 28:21.911
but the real target is my family.

28:23.215 --> 28:25.582
Monty, I need you to initiate

28:25.584 --> 28:29.052
the Bureau's protection
protocols for my wife and kids.

28:33.725 --> 28:36.693
I just spoke to Millie.
Have you heard from Josie?

28:36.695 --> 28:38.995
Yes. She was picked up at USC's campus

28:38.997 --> 28:41.264
and taken to the FBI's L.A. offices.

28:41.266 --> 28:42.532
Jack Junior?

28:42.534 --> 28:44.300
With his troop in a secure location.

28:44.302 --> 28:45.401
And Ryan?

28:45.403 --> 28:47.504
Ryan was at a conference in Helsinki,

28:47.506 --> 28:50.006
but agents are on their way to him now.

28:51.276 --> 28:52.776
Karen, your children are safe.

28:52.778 --> 28:55.378
How long to the Embassy?

28:55.380 --> 28:58.014
A few minutes.

28:58.016 --> 28:59.849
Great, thanks.

28:59.851 --> 29:01.951
No problem.

29:07.221 --> 29:09.682
Jack, everyone's accounted
for except for Ryan.

29:09.776 --> 29:11.443
- Where is he?
- Helsinki.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.211
That's only a few hours from here.

29:13.213 --> 29:16.047
What, you think Oleg escaped
and went all the way to Finland?

29:16.049 --> 29:18.183
Ivan's continuing to
do Oleg's dirty work,

29:18.185 --> 29:20.285
but he'll bring Ryan
back to St. Petersburg

29:20.287 --> 29:21.486
so Oleg can kill him.

29:21.488 --> 29:24.556
I can track him. He's
off grid, but I can.

29:24.558 --> 29:26.758
Monty, I know what
you're thinking, but no.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.426
Not even for my son.

29:31.331 --> 29:33.431
May I speak with my husband?

29:34.368 --> 29:37.102
Of course.

29:41.842 --> 29:43.108
Karen.

29:43.110 --> 29:46.344
Jack, tell me everything.

29:47.514 --> 29:49.414
Ryan's been abducted.

29:49.416 --> 29:53.985
An ex-K.G.B. agent that I
once put away has escaped,

29:53.987 --> 29:56.955
and if I don't find Ryan
first, he'll kill him.

29:58.425 --> 30:00.125
What are the options?

30:01.161 --> 30:04.229
FBI protocol demands
each field agent have

30:04.231 --> 30:07.098
an optical tracking
device on their person.

30:07.100 --> 30:09.334
And Monty would have to
hack into an NSA satellite

30:09.336 --> 30:10.869
and point it at Russia.

30:10.871 --> 30:14.606
If caught, we'd be accused of spying,

30:14.608 --> 30:17.542
and it could cause an
international incident.

30:18.545 --> 30:20.345
And be the end of the IRT.

30:20.347 --> 30:21.780
Exactly.

30:22.657 --> 30:24.041
Unless you got permission.

30:25.719 --> 30:28.320
We got a better chance
of hitting the lotto.

30:28.322 --> 30:30.422
You just need some Lady Luck,

30:30.424 --> 30:32.557
so you tell me who to speak to,

30:32.559 --> 30:38.129
and then, Jack, bring our boy home.

30:46.273 --> 30:48.273
Can I help you?

30:48.275 --> 30:50.709
Yes. Karen Garrett,

30:50.711 --> 30:53.578
Jack's wife, Ryan's mother.

30:53.580 --> 30:54.879
Of course.

30:54.881 --> 30:56.915
I've been briefed on what's happening.

30:56.917 --> 30:58.650
The FBI is doing everything we can.

30:58.652 --> 31:00.352
We're in constant
communication with the Kremlin.

31:00.354 --> 31:03.688
So standard operational procedures.

31:04.825 --> 31:07.158
And that's the best
we can offer right now.

31:08.362 --> 31:11.630
For two U.S. FBI agents in trouble?

31:11.632 --> 31:14.199
Who understood the risk involved.

31:15.268 --> 31:17.669
I thought America didn't
leave its heroes behind.

31:17.671 --> 31:19.406
We have an extraction team
in the air as we speak.

31:19.461 --> 31:21.406
Which will never get there in time,

31:21.408 --> 31:24.042
and my son will pay the
ultimate price for that!

31:24.044 --> 31:27.345
I wish there were more
I could do, but I can't.

31:27.347 --> 31:29.981
If you'll excuse me, I
have a standing appointment

31:29.983 --> 31:31.549
that I cannot miss.

31:31.551 --> 31:33.151
Yes, of course.

31:33.153 --> 31:35.854
Spend every precious
moment you can with them.

31:37.024 --> 31:38.890
How old is he?

31:40.327 --> 31:42.627
He's 5.

31:42.629 --> 31:44.262
5.

31:44.264 --> 31:45.830
They're so sweet when they're 5.

31:45.832 --> 31:48.299
They hug you and tell you
they're gonna love you forever.

31:48.301 --> 31:50.135
Yes.

31:50.137 --> 31:52.704
Enjoy it while you can.

31:52.706 --> 31:55.240
Because they grow up very fast,

31:55.242 --> 31:59.077
and you can't be there to
hold them and protect them.

31:59.079 --> 32:03.348
You just have to pray that they're okay

32:03.350 --> 32:06.584
and that someone else
is looking after them.

32:10.157 --> 32:11.990
Jack, I am tracking Ryan.

32:11.992 --> 32:14.359
Karen.

32:14.361 --> 32:16.294
So Assistant Director
Barnes gave the go...

32:16.296 --> 32:18.863
She said, Don't get caught"
So I'm covering my trail

32:18.865 --> 32:20.365
by making it look like environmentalists

32:20.367 --> 32:22.167
are trying to track a
herd of migratory reindeer

32:22.169 --> 32:25.103
through the Arctic, but I
should have Ryan's location soon.

32:25.105 --> 32:27.272
- Thanks, Monty.
- That's the easy part, Jack.

32:27.274 --> 32:28.907
You're the one who has
to get off that plan.

32:28.909 --> 32:30.508
Well, being that we're surrounded,

32:30.510 --> 32:33.611
we'd need an act of
God for that to happen.

32:33.613 --> 32:36.047
I messed up, Jack.

32:36.049 --> 32:39.784
Maybe now I can fix a little, huh?

32:42.723 --> 32:46.191
I am going to act like I snapped,

32:46.193 --> 32:48.026
shoot a tire or two,

32:48.028 --> 32:49.961
cause distraction.

32:49.963 --> 32:54.032
Don't worry. I'm not
going to hurt anybody.

32:54.034 --> 32:55.667
Will they hurt you?

32:55.669 --> 32:57.669
They throw me in box for a while.

32:57.671 --> 33:01.606
I'll plead insanity. They
give me dishonorable discharge.

33:01.608 --> 33:03.374
Boris... Hey,

33:03.376 --> 33:05.577
my pension was crap anyway.

33:07.347 --> 33:08.613
Goodbye, Jack.

33:14.087 --> 33:16.454
If he pulls this off, we can all get out

33:16.456 --> 33:18.723
through the front
wheel hatch undetected.

33:22.562 --> 33:25.463
Monty's already put
his career on the line.

33:25.465 --> 33:28.566
I can't and won't

33:28.568 --> 33:32.137
ask the rest of you to do the same.

33:32.139 --> 33:33.671
I gotta do this alone.

33:35.876 --> 33:37.675
Get the plane in the air right now.

33:37.677 --> 33:38.977
That's an order.

34:23.523 --> 34:25.156
Dad.

34:25.158 --> 34:27.525
- Ryan.
- Don't.

34:30.563 --> 34:32.230
The tracking device in Ivan's mouth.

34:32.232 --> 34:34.331
You knew all along I'd find you.

34:34.333 --> 34:38.069
Of course I did. You
are like Clint Eastwood.

34:38.071 --> 34:39.871
You always get your man.

34:39.873 --> 34:43.808
Now put gun down, or I put
a hole in your son's head.

34:43.810 --> 34:45.176
You do that, and you're dead.

34:45.178 --> 34:48.413
Yes, but your son will also be.

34:48.415 --> 34:53.150
My way... maybe one of you lives.

34:53.152 --> 34:57.255
Now toss your gun this way.

35:10.003 --> 35:11.803
You like my work?

35:11.805 --> 35:13.972
I like to tenderize my meat

35:13.974 --> 35:16.441
before I take a bite.

35:16.443 --> 35:18.476
This is between us, Oleg.

35:18.478 --> 35:20.278
Maybe in your country,

35:20.280 --> 35:21.846
but in Russia,

35:21.848 --> 35:23.915
you do something wrong to someone,

35:23.917 --> 35:25.783
it becomes family affair.

35:27.387 --> 35:30.188
Do you know why you fell into my lap?

35:30.190 --> 35:31.756
I'm not playing games.

35:31.758 --> 35:34.525
Because you're arrogant.

35:34.527 --> 35:37.896
You fly around the world like Superman.

35:37.898 --> 35:40.131
Noble patriot.

35:40.133 --> 35:43.868
You self-righteously pretend
to serve your country,

35:43.870 --> 35:47.872
but it is your own ego that you serve.

35:49.209 --> 35:52.577
Look at your son, following
you into the battle.

35:54.714 --> 36:00.151
For what? To continue
your legacy of hypocrisy?

36:00.153 --> 36:02.587
But here you are,

36:02.589 --> 36:06.357
disobedient, a man without a country,

36:06.359 --> 36:08.359
without a team.

36:08.361 --> 36:10.628
Who are you now?

36:10.630 --> 36:11.930
You are nothing.

36:11.932 --> 36:14.132
I'm more than you'll ever be,

36:14.134 --> 36:17.435
because I know what it
is to love and be loved,

36:17.437 --> 36:20.471
unlike a narcissistic sadist like you

36:20.473 --> 36:22.707
who gets off on other people's pain

36:22.709 --> 36:26.511
because he can't feel
anything for himself.

36:26.513 --> 36:29.514
Boris was wrong about you.

36:29.516 --> 36:30.848
You're no monster.

36:30.850 --> 36:34.285
You're just a low-level thug
with delusions of grandeur.

36:44.564 --> 36:45.997
Take this gun.

36:45.999 --> 36:48.132
Take it!

36:48.134 --> 36:50.034
Take the gun!

36:50.036 --> 36:51.836
Take it!

36:51.838 --> 36:54.196
You shoot your father in the heart,

36:54.258 --> 36:55.773
or I shoot you.

36:57.510 --> 37:00.445
If I pull this trigger,
you're just gonna kill me, too.

37:00.447 --> 37:02.213
Maybe not.

37:03.216 --> 37:04.682
You can't be serious.

37:04.684 --> 37:07.251
He wants us both to suffer.

37:07.253 --> 37:09.654
And he'll get great joy out of knowing

37:09.656 --> 37:11.723
that he forced you to kill me.

37:11.725 --> 37:14.792
So if it's between you or
me, there's no choice, Ryan.

37:14.794 --> 37:16.194
You...

37:16.196 --> 37:18.029
You know what you have to do.

37:18.031 --> 37:19.697
I can't shoot you, Dad!

37:19.699 --> 37:20.965
Let me help.

37:20.967 --> 37:24.502
On count of three, kill or be killed.

37:24.504 --> 37:26.037
- One...
- Do it, Ryan!

37:26.039 --> 37:27.705
- Dad, I can't.
- Two...

37:27.707 --> 37:29.107
Listen to me, Ryan. Pull the trigger!

37:29.109 --> 37:30.274
Three!

37:30.276 --> 37:33.845
Shoot me now, Ryan...

37:48.328 --> 37:50.995
After you are dead,

37:50.997 --> 37:55.033
I am going to take small
chunks out of your son

37:55.035 --> 37:57.435
slowly and painfully

37:57.437 --> 38:00.671
until he is begging for death.

38:00.673 --> 38:03.975
And then I will put
his mouth on sidewalk

38:03.977 --> 38:06.144
and I will curb him

38:06.146 --> 38:08.713
until there is nothing left but mush.

38:08.715 --> 38:10.448
And then I will continue

38:10.450 --> 38:13.551
what I was doing before you stopped me,

38:13.553 --> 38:18.489
and every person that I
kill for the rest of my life,

38:18.491 --> 38:21.826
their blood will be on
your hands, Jack Garrett.

38:21.828 --> 38:25.696
Now how is that for
delusions of grandeur?

38:28.168 --> 38:31.235
What you think, I am stupid?

38:31.237 --> 38:33.071
That I give you more than one bullet

38:33.073 --> 38:34.539
then turn my back on you?

38:34.541 --> 38:38.443
No, but I got you to come over here.

38:38.445 --> 38:40.478
No!

38:43.383 --> 38:45.149
Dad!

38:45.151 --> 38:46.851
Dad, hang on.

38:49.155 --> 38:50.254
Ryan...

38:50.256 --> 38:52.690
Dad, I'm coming!

38:53.793 --> 38:56.160
- Ryan...
- Dad.

38:56.162 --> 38:58.396
Dad.

38:59.632 --> 39:01.365
Listen to me. You're
gonna be okay, all right?

39:01.367 --> 39:02.934
I need you to stay with me.

39:02.936 --> 39:06.471
I need you to fight, okay? You can't go.

39:07.774 --> 39:09.807
Dad.

39:09.809 --> 39:11.242
Dad!

39:11.244 --> 39:12.910
Good work, Dad.

39:12.912 --> 39:15.113
Couldn't have done it without you, Son.

39:16.015 --> 39:17.682
Ryan, you wanna race to the car?

39:17.684 --> 39:20.084
Ready? Go!

39:21.988 --> 39:23.221
Cheers!

39:23.223 --> 39:26.190
Cheers!

39:26.192 --> 39:29.494

all right, Dad? Stay with me.
