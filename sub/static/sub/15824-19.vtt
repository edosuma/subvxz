WEBVTT

00:20.854 --> 00:23.691
Wallingham:
FATHER ADAM?

00:23.724 --> 00:26.660
OH, SO SORRY.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.397
LAST RITES.
HERE'S THE ADDRESS.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.165
THE DOCTOR'S ON CALL,

00:31.199 --> 00:34.168
SO HE'LL LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED
IF HE HAS TO GO.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.703
WHAT SHALL I SAY?

00:35.736 --> 00:37.271
AH, THAT...

00:37.305 --> 00:39.373
I'LL BE THERE AS SOON AS
I GET MY THINGS TOGETHER.

00:40.674 --> 00:45.045
OH, AND, UH, COFFEE, PLEASE,
MRS. DEBBIE.

01:01.729 --> 01:05.733
LET'S SEE.
APARTMENT 4.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.661
DR. HANLIN?

01:35.229 --> 01:38.499
HELLO

01:51.812 --> 01:55.916
ARNOLD BASKY. ARNOLD BASKY.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.618
MR. BASKY.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.331
MR. BASKY?

02:10.364 --> 02:13.701
IT'S FATHER ADAM
FROM ST. ANGELO'S?

02:16.670 --> 02:19.139
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO HEAR YOUR CONFESSION?

02:21.842 --> 02:23.844
MR. BASKY?

02:23.877 --> 02:25.646
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO ANOINT YOU?

02:47.668 --> 02:52.440
GOD OF MERCY,
EASE THE SUFFERINGS

02:52.473 --> 02:55.243
AND COMFORT THE WEAKNESS
OF YOUR SERVANT ARNOLD,

02:55.276 --> 02:59.547
WHO THE CHURCH ANOINTS
WITH THIS HOLY OIL.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.561
RIGHT THROUGH
HIS COLLAR, SIR.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.963
MURDERED PRIEST IN
A GRADE-SCHOOL PARKING LOT.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.533
MAKES ME THINK
BAD THINGS.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.535
HEY, GUYS, I COULDN'T FIND ANY
VISIBLE BLOOD IN THE FRONT SEAT,

03:54.568 --> 03:57.405
ONLY IN THE BACK
WHERE THIS RUG WAS.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.407
FELLAS, WE NEED TO MOVE
THE PRIEST'S BODY

03:59.440 --> 04:01.575
OUT OF HERE A.S.A.P.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.876
OH

04:02.910 --> 04:04.478
I STILL HAVE
A LOT OF STUFF TO DO HERE.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.614
Gabriel: CHIEF JOHNSON WON'T
WANT US TO MOVE THE BODY

04:06.647 --> 04:08.649
UNTIL WE'RE DONE --
YEAH,
WHERE IS CHIEF JOHNSON?

04:08.682 --> 04:11.319
Provenza: WELL, SHE'S AT HOME
TAKING CARE OF HER FATHER.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.321
SOMETHING I CAN DO
FOR YOU, SIR?

04:13.354 --> 04:14.988
I WAS JUST ON THE PHONE
WITH THE ARCHBISHOP,

04:15.022 --> 04:16.557
AND I PROMISED HIM

04:16.590 --> 04:18.326
WE WOULD TRY TO MINIMIZE
THE STUDENTS' EXPOSURE

04:18.359 --> 04:19.827
TO THIS TRAGEDY.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.395
I'LL FIND SOMETHING
TO COVER HIM UP, SIR.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.497
THANK YOU.
AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
CHIEF,

04:23.531 --> 04:24.832
WE NEED TO FIND OUT

04:24.865 --> 04:26.634
IF THIS RUG IS FROM
THE PRIEST'S ROOM OR --

04:26.667 --> 04:28.469
NO, NO. NOT YET.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.003
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"NO, NO. NOT YET"?

04:30.037 --> 04:32.873
THE JESUITS WHO RUN THIS SCHOOL
HAVE REQUESTED

04:32.906 --> 04:35.876
THAT WE WAIT FOR AN ARCHIVIST
FROM THEIR ORDER

04:35.909 --> 04:38.612
TO COLLECT THE DEAD PRIEST'S
JOURNALS AND DOCUMENTS

04:38.646 --> 04:40.614
BEFORE WE SEARCH THE ROOM.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.350
SOUNDS LIKE FATHER ADAM HERE
MAY HAVE BEEN UP TO SOMETHING

04:42.383 --> 04:45.319
THAT THE CHURCH
DOESN'T WANT US TO SEE.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.987
THE DIOCESE HAS HAD SERVICES
AT THIS CATHEDRAL

04:47.020 --> 04:49.990
FOR FIVE L.A.P.D. OFFICERS
IN THE PAST YEAR,

04:50.023 --> 04:51.992
TWO OF WHOM
WERE NOT EVEN CATHOLIC.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.395
SO WE WILL TREAT
THEIR DEAD

04:54.428 --> 04:55.796
WITH THE SAME RESPECT
THAT THEY HAVE SHOWN OURS.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.998
AND WE'LL GIVE THEM
A MOMENT

04:58.031 --> 05:00.033
TO GATHER
THE VICTIM'S BELONGINGS

05:00.067 --> 05:02.570
WHILE I MAKE A DEAL
WITH THE ARCHBISHOP TO
EXAMINE HIS PAPERS.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.071
IN THE MEANTIME,

05:04.104 --> 05:06.039
CAN WE DISCREETLY
GET A CORONER'S VAN AROUND HERE

05:06.073 --> 05:07.641
TO GET RID OF THE BODY?

05:07.675 --> 05:09.477
AND LET'S GET THIS VEHICLE
OUT OF HERE, TOO.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.545
AND IF CHIEF JOHNSON HAS
A PROBLEM WITH ANY OF THAT,

05:11.579 --> 05:13.313
SHE CAN TAKE IT UP
WITH ME.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.817
Flynn: WELL, I GUESS
WE CAN ALL STOP WONDERING

05:16.850 --> 05:18.619
IF THE POPE'S CATHOLIC.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.922
"IF CHIEF JOHNSON
HAS A PROBLEM WITH THAT"?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.925
Provenza: TAO!
CORONER.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.794
SANCHEZ, UH,
GET A TOW TRUCK.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.462
AND -- AND -- OH!

05:28.496 --> 05:30.798
MAKE SURE THAT THEIR EMERGENCY
LIGHTS ARE SWITCHED OFF,

05:30.831 --> 05:32.666
LEST WE THREATEN
THE DELICATE BALANCE

05:32.700 --> 05:34.835
OF CHURCH AND STATE.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.876
DADDY, WHY DON'T YOU USE
THE WALKER?

05:42.910 --> 05:44.612
WE HAD IT MADE SPECIAL
FOR YOU.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.481
ANSWER YOUR PHONE.
I'M...I'M FINE.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.616
ANSWER THE PHONE!

05:48.649 --> 05:49.817
OKAY. OKAY.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.386
OH, BRENDA LEIGH!

05:52.420 --> 05:54.087
OH! OH, DADDY!

05:54.121 --> 05:56.690
MAMA, I'M SO SORRY.
DADDY, ARE YOU OKAY?

05:58.058 --> 05:59.393
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN HOW HARD
IT WAS TO GET UP,

05:59.427 --> 06:00.828
I WOULD HAVE STAYED IN BED.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.596
WELL, THE DOCTOR SAID
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU

06:02.630 --> 06:03.997
TO MOVE AROUND,

06:04.031 --> 06:05.533
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE
FOR THESE NEW DRUGS

06:05.566 --> 06:07.401
TO BALANCE OUT
YOUR HORMONES, OKAY?

06:07.435 --> 06:09.403
I'VE BEEN HERE
A WEEK ALREADY.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.839
YES, BUT REMEMBER
ATLANTA, CLAY?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.574
YOU COULD HARDLY MOVE
AT ALL.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.843
OKAY.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.446
OKAY,
THE BED'S RIGHT HERE.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.983
YES. I'M FINE.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.919
I JUST...JUST NEED
TO CATCH MY BREATH.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.055
OKAY.
I'M FINE.

06:28.088 --> 06:31.792
OKAY.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.764
MOM, HOW IN THE WORLD
HAVE YOU BEEN DEALING WITH THIS

06:36.797 --> 06:38.599
ALL ON YOUR OWN?

06:38.632 --> 06:40.033
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THIS IS BETTER.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.703
THIS IS BETTER?
Clay: THIS IS BETTER!

06:42.736 --> 06:44.972
THIS NEW THERAPY'S
WORKING.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.575
NOW WE HAVE TO SEE
HOW FAR IT TAKES US.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.611
ANSWER THE PHONE!
YES!

06:54.548 --> 06:56.850
YES, LIEUTENANT.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.986
WELL, ONLY IF YOU CONSIDER
ARGUING WITH THE POPE

06:59.019 --> 07:02.790
OVER A BUNCH OF 2,000-YEAR-OLD
SUPERSTITIONS A PROBLEM.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.726
THE POPE?
Here,
talk to a believer.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.462
WHAT?
I'M NOT CATHOLIC.

07:08.496 --> 07:11.131
UH, HI, CHIEF.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.133
POPE DOESN'T WANT US
TO SEARCH THE RECTORY

07:13.166 --> 07:14.735
BEFORE AN ARCHIVIST
CAN GATHER --

07:14.768 --> 07:17.905
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT KIND OF AN ARCHIVIST?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.907
UH, AN ARCHIVIST.
IT'S A JESUIT OFFICIAL.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.174
The archivist collects

07:21.208 --> 07:23.210
ALL THE DEAD PRIESTS'
JOURNALS AND WRITINGS.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.112
IT'S KIND OF A RITUAL THING
THEY DO.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.847
OH, YEAH?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.949
WELL, I HAVE AN L.A.P.D.
RITUAL THING THAT SAYS NO ONE

07:28.982 --> 07:31.218
GOES IN OR OUT OF THE RECTORY
WHERE OUR MURDERED PRIEST LIVED

07:31.251 --> 07:33.821
UNTIL WE HAVE A CHANCE
TO LOOK AROUND.

07:33.854 --> 07:34.855
UNDERSTOOD?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.090
UM, POPE WANTS --

07:37.124 --> 07:38.859
YEAH, WELL, TELL CHIEF POPE
I'M COMING DOWN.

07:38.892 --> 07:42.563
HEAVEN'S SAKES.

07:47.601 --> 07:50.270
GO.
TAKE CARE OF YOUR MURDER.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.005
YEAH, BUT DADDY ALMOST FELL DOWN
A MINUTE AGO.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.741
MAMA, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET SOME HELP?

07:53.774 --> 07:55.175
HE WON'T HAVE HELP.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.911
HE HAS TO THINK
HE'S DOING EVERYTHING HIMSELF,

07:57.945 --> 08:00.013
EVEN IF IT KILLS HIM.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.715
WELL, DON'T BE AFRAID
OF THAT.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.784
I MEAN, THE DOCTOR SAID WE'RE IN
NO DANGER OF LOSING DADDY.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.186
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF LOSING HIM.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.488
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT HOW TO KEEP HIM.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.234
HEY, CHIEF.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.504
POPE JUST LET THE ARCHIVIST
GO INTO THE RECTORY.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.141
IS THERE A BACK WAY?

08:28.175 --> 08:30.678
UH, NO, MA'AM.

08:30.711 --> 08:31.779
BUT THERE'S A FRONT ONE.

08:50.931 --> 08:51.932
SWITCH HERE.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.775
EXCUSE ME.
YES?
CAN I HELP YOU?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.310
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON

09:03.343 --> 09:04.812
OF THE L.A.P.D.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.313
AND IS THE ROOM
OF THE PRIEST --

09:06.346 --> 09:07.915
UH, MA'AM,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.349
I NEED YOU TO LEAVE.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.851
ACTUALLY,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.119
WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

09:12.152 --> 09:15.155
I'M MRS. WALLINGHAM,
THE RECTORY SUPERVISOR,

09:15.188 --> 09:17.157
AND YOU HAVE TO LEAVE
RIGHT NOW.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.593
YOU NEED TO STEP ASIDE,
OR I'LL PUT YOU UNDER ARREST.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.595
WAIT!
YOU CANNOT GO IN THERE!

09:21.629 --> 09:23.263
HELLO, SIR.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:23.296 --> 09:26.900
I'M COLLECTING FATHER ADAM'S
PERSONAL RECORDS AND JOURNALS.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.135
WHY, WHAT'S IN 'EM?

09:28.168 --> 09:29.637
HIS DAILY ACTIVITIES,

09:29.670 --> 09:32.305
HIS PRIVATE THOUGHTS,
PRAYERS.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.107
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
WE'LL BE TAKING THOSE.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.809
YOU WOULD HAVE TO
TAKE MY LIFE FIRST.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.711
LUCKY FOR ME,
I'M ARMED.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.112
SIT DOWN.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.221
YEAH, CHIEF.

09:48.255 --> 09:52.059
DETECTIVE, WHAT SIZE WAS THE RUG
OUR VICTIM WAS ROLLED UP IN?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.795
UH, ABOUT 6'x9'.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.064
WELL, THAT COULD FIT.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.365
I --

09:58.398 --> 10:00.400
BRENDA, WHERE --
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.670
I'M SEARCHING THE ROOM
OF A HOMICIDE VICTIM.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.238
SAY "HI" TO THE ARCHBISHOP
FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.908
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW FATHER ADAM?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.910
AROUND 2:00 A.M.
THIS MORNING.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.178
I MADE THE FATHER COFFEE,

10:11.211 --> 10:13.313
AND HE WENT OUT
TO A LAST RITES CALL.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.048
WHERE WAS HE GOING?

10:15.082 --> 10:17.184
LOOK, SOMEONE'S OUT THERE
MURDERING PRIESTS.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.787
YOU WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE NEXT ONE WHO DIES?

10:19.820 --> 10:22.089
WHERE WAS FATHER ADAM
GOING?

10:23.824 --> 10:26.059
HERE'S THE APARTMENT'S
ADDRESS.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.796
A DOCTOR CALLED IT IN.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.298
THANK YOU.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.900
CHIEF JOHNSON,
COME WITH ME.

10:32.933 --> 10:33.934
WHY?

10:33.967 --> 10:35.335
COME ON. HURRY.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.070
OH, TOO LATE.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.406
Taylor:
UH, CHIEF JOHNSON,

10:39.439 --> 10:41.108
YOU HAVE CREATED
A MAJOR PROBLEM HERE.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.710
CHIEF JOHNSON,
YOU ARE UNDERMINING

10:42.743 --> 10:43.977
MY NEGOTIATIONS
WITH THE CHURCH

10:44.011 --> 10:45.979
AND I NEED YOU OUT
OF THIS RECTORY NOW.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.885
NOT TILL WE GET
FATHER ADAM'S JOURNALS,

10:51.919 --> 10:54.387
WHICH THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE TO HIDE FROM US.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.389
THEY'RE NOT HIDING
ANYTHING.

10:56.423 --> 11:00.393
LOOK, THE CHURCH HAS SPENT
$500 MILLION DOLLARS

11:00.427 --> 11:01.929
ADDRESSING THEIR SINS
OF THE PAST,

11:01.962 --> 11:03.396
AND THEY'RE NERVOUS
THAT PEOPLE ARE --

11:03.430 --> 11:05.699
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
WHY THEY'RE WORRIED?!

11:05.733 --> 11:07.835
A PRIEST WHO TEACHES
AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

11:07.868 --> 11:09.036
GETS MURDERED?

11:09.069 --> 11:09.937
IT DOES SCREAM
ANGRY PARENT, SIR.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.271
LOOK, FOR ALL WE KNOW,

11:11.304 --> 11:13.807
THE KILLER IS ANOTHER PRIEST
WHO LIVES HERE!

11:13.841 --> 11:15.342
OF COURSE,
TO FIGURE THAT OUT,

11:15.375 --> 11:17.010
WE'D HAVE TO ACTUALLY
SEARCH THIS PLACE

11:17.044 --> 11:19.446
LIKE WE WERE CONDUCTING
A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.314
OKAY.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.084
I THINK YOU ARE EXHAUSTED,

11:24.117 --> 11:26.419
AND I THINK YOU'RE LETTING
YOUR FATHER'S HEALTH PROBLEMS

11:26.453 --> 11:28.856
AFFECT
YOUR DECISION MAKING...

11:28.889 --> 11:30.457
DON'T YOU BRING MY FATHER
INTO THIS.
...WHICH IS COMPLETELY
UNDERSTANDABLE.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.359
THIS HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH SOME KIND OF
A PERSONAL RESPONSE.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.127
NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR
YOU TO TRY TO SUPERCEDE
COMMAND DECISIONS.

11:34.161 --> 11:37.264
THIS IS AN ACTION.
I NEED YOU
OUT OF HERE, NOW!

11:45.873 --> 11:48.475
Sanchez: APARTMENT 4.
YES, THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.383
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T THINK
OF THE TENANT'S NAME.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.351
HE'S PRETTY NEW HERE.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.486
DO YOU HAVE HIS LEASE?

11:59.519 --> 12:00.954
SURE,
IT'S IN THE OFFICE.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.222
OH.
BUT, UH, DETECTIVE?

12:02.255 --> 12:04.724
YEAH.
THANK YOU.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.533
HMM.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.437
BLESS ME FATHER, FOR I HAVE
DONE NOTHING BUT WATCH PORNOS.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.307
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS IT GOES
WITH THE WINE COOLERS.

12:20.340 --> 12:24.044
HEY, GUYS. BACK HERE.

12:28.081 --> 12:32.185
I'M THINKING AN AREA RUG
LEFT THIS NICE IMPRESSION

12:32.219 --> 12:33.420
ON THE WALL-TO-WALL
CARPET.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.492
YEAH, 6'x9'.

12:42.495 --> 12:43.864
HUH.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.433
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.567
Tao: OH.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.002
CHECK THIS OUT.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.137
HMM.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.975
GENTLEMEN.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.947
Tao: OH, NO.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.449
FREAK.

13:05.085 --> 13:09.022
HEY, UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, BUT...

13:11.191 --> 13:13.326
OH.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.330
THIS APARTMENT IS LEASED
TO AN ADAM GRAY

13:17.364 --> 13:19.900
AS IN OUR VICTIM --
FATHER ADAM.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.479
Ray: THOSE POOR GIRLS
LOOKED UP TO THAT PRIEST,

13:32.512 --> 13:34.147
AND HE TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF THEM.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.448
Brenda: WELL, MAMA,
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON

13:35.482 --> 13:36.984
IN THAT APARTMENT.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.019
WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANY
FINGERPRINTS ON THE PICTURES,

13:39.052 --> 13:40.553
HARDLY ANY IN THE APARTMENT
AT ALL, ACTUALLY,

13:40.587 --> 13:42.022
WHICH IS STRANGE.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.957
AND WE HAVEN'T FOUND
ANY OF THE PRIEST'S DNA

13:43.991 --> 13:45.592
ON THE GIRLS' CLOTHING.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.561
SHOULDN'T YOU BE TALKING ABOUT
ALL THAT WITH THE PARENTS?

13:48.595 --> 13:50.964
WELL, FRITZ IS HELPING
THE L.A.P.D.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.900
WITH THE MOLESTATION
ISSUES.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.302
OH, NOW Y'ALL ARE
REARRANGING YOUR WHOLE LIVES

13:55.335 --> 13:56.469
BECAUSE OF ME.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.205
NO, NO, DADDY.
NOT AT ALL.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.873
IT'S JUST THAT THE FBI
HAS A LOT MORE RESOURCES

13:59.907 --> 14:01.608
FOR THAT KIND OF THING
THAN WE DO.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.510
SO, IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE
TO BE DOING,

14:03.543 --> 14:06.479
I'D BE DOING IT.

14:06.513 --> 14:10.250
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DADDY?
YOU DIDN'T LIKE YOUR SOUP?

14:10.283 --> 14:11.985
OH, IT'S FINE.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.187
BUT MY TASTER'S NOT.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.590
THE DOCTOR SAID THE DRUGS
WOULD HAVE THAT AFFECT.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.360
BUT IF EVERYTHING'S
GONNA TASTE LIKE MUD,

14:20.393 --> 14:22.129
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF BEING ALIVE?

14:22.162 --> 14:26.199
WELL, I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR
YOU'RE READY TO GIVE UP AND DIE

14:26.233 --> 14:28.268
AFTER I'VE BEEN STAYING UP
ALL NIGHT WITH YOU

14:28.301 --> 14:30.070
FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS

14:30.103 --> 14:31.504
AND YOUR DAUGHTER FLEW YOU
ALL THE WAY ACROSS COUNTRY.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.374
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TRY AGAIN.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.076
Fritz: I'M BACK.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.444
FRITZI.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.381
HEY.
HOW'S YOUR DAD DOING?

14:41.414 --> 14:44.117
HE'S, UH...BETTER.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.585
BETTER.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.420
HE'S NOT EATING MUCH,
BUT HE'S -- HE'S WALKING.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.590
ANYWAY, UH,
WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT?

14:50.623 --> 14:53.593
WELL, WE INTERVIEWED THE PARENTS
OF THE IDENTIFIED GIRLS

14:53.626 --> 14:55.929
WITHOUT MENTIONING
FATHER ADAM.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.230
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

14:57.264 --> 14:58.565
THERE'S ANY KIND
OF SEXUAL ABUSE GOING ON.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.934
AND OUR CYBER-PORN DIVISION
ISN'T CONVINCED

15:00.968 --> 15:02.602
THOSE PICTURES WERE TAKEN BY
A CHILD MOLESTER.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.304
WHY NOT?

15:04.337 --> 15:05.572
WELL, FOR ONE THING, THERE WERE
TOO MANY DIFFERENT GIRLS.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.307
APPARENTLY,
ACTIVE PEDOPHILES

15:07.340 --> 15:09.042
GROOM THEIR TARGETS
MORE CAREFULLY.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.577
LOOK, THE PICTURES
ARE CREEPY, YEAH,

15:10.610 --> 15:12.612
BUT THEY'RE NOT PORNOGRAPHIC.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.648
ABUSE --
NOT REALLY SEEING IT.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.985
WELL, THAT COULD BE ENOUGH
TO CONVINCE THE CHURCH

15:18.018 --> 15:19.953
THAT WE'RE NOT ON SOME KIND OF
A WITCH HUNT.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.222
I'M GONNA GO --
OH, NO.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.724
DADDY'S GOT AN APPOINTMENT IN
AN HOUR AND A HALF, AND I --

15:24.757 --> 15:27.327
I ALREADY TOOK
THE AFTERNOON OFF.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.396
YOUR DAD LIKES MY DRIVING
BETTER ANYWAY.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.664
HE...DID NOT SAY THAT.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.300
DID HE?
ACTUALLY...

15:33.333 --> 15:36.003
HE SAID YOU "STEER THE CAR
LIKE A LOST GETAWAY DRIVER."

15:36.036 --> 15:38.638
OH,
THAT SOUNDS JUST LIKE HIM.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.708
MAYBE THINGS
ARE GONNA GET BETTER.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.410
YEAH.

15:43.443 --> 15:47.214
Raydor: WELL, NOT IF YOU KEEP
PUSHING TO GET THIS JOURNAL.

15:47.247 --> 15:51.484
ALTHOUGH,
I SUPPOSE SUGGESTING

15:51.518 --> 15:54.054
THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS WE FOUND
WERE NOT PORNOGRAPHIC

15:54.087 --> 15:57.290
COULD HELP REOPEN DIALOG
WITH THE ARCHDIOCESE.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.292
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
REOPEN DIALOG.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.727
THE CHURCH SHOULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN ALLOWED

16:00.760 --> 16:02.429
TO TAKE THE VICTIM'S JOURNAL
TO BEGIN WITH!

16:02.462 --> 16:04.431
CHIEF JOHNSON,
IN A CASE LIKE THIS,

16:04.464 --> 16:07.200
THERE ARE NATIONAL,
POSSIBLY INTERNATIONAL,

16:07.234 --> 16:08.701
IMPLICATIONS.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.404
IN FACT, IN ORDER TO REGAIN
THE COOPERATION OF THE CHURCH,

16:11.438 --> 16:14.141
THE L.A.P.D. HAS TO GIVE IT
ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE

16:14.174 --> 16:17.177
THAT OUR OFFICIAL CHAIN
OF COMMAND WILL BE RESPECTED.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.113
I'VE ALWAYS RESPECTED --
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:20.147 --> 16:23.283
IS THIS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH CHIEF POPE AT THE RECTORY?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.052
I WAS ONLY DOING MY JOB.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.187
BY PERFORMING
A WARRANTLESS SEARCH?

16:27.220 --> 16:30.457
BY THREATENING A CHURCH
ARCHIVIST WITH YOUR WEAPON?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.325
I DIDN'T THREATEN ANYBODY.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.427
I HAD MY GUN HOLSTERED
THE ENTIRE TIME.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.730
REFUSING THE ORDERS OF
A SUPERIOR IS INSUBORDINATION,

16:37.764 --> 16:39.366
AND YOU DID IT PUBLICLY,

16:39.399 --> 16:43.170
WHICH IS DETAILED
IN THIS UNSIGNED COMPLAINT

16:43.203 --> 16:45.638
THAT CHIEF POPE LEFT WITH ME
LAST NIGHT.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.211
HE'S REALLY THIS MAD?

16:51.244 --> 16:53.713
OH-OH, YES.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.149
AND HE'S FRUSTRATED.

16:56.183 --> 16:59.086
AT ONE TIME,
HE MAY HAVE BEEN YOUR FRIEND

16:59.119 --> 17:02.722
AND SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT,
BUT HE IS ALSO YOUR BOSS.

17:02.755 --> 17:07.026
AND HE'S DEMANDING THAT YOU
RECOGNIZE HIS AUTHORITY.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.063
I WANT THAT JOURNAL.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.632
DID YOU NOT HEAR ONE WORD
THAT I JUST SAID?

17:12.665 --> 17:15.635
I KEPT CHIEF POPE
FROM SIGNING THAT COMPLAINT

17:15.668 --> 17:17.370
BY ASSURING HIM

17:17.404 --> 17:20.373
THAT YOU WERE CAPABLE
OF SEEING HIS POSITION.

17:20.407 --> 17:23.276
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
HAS ENORMOUS INFLUENCE.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.278
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
INVESTIGATE THIS HOMICIDE

17:25.312 --> 17:28.148
IF THE ENTIRE POWER STRUCTURE
HERE IS LINING UP

17:28.181 --> 17:31.284
TO PROTECT THE POOR,
DEFENSELESS CATHOLIC CHURCH?

17:31.318 --> 17:33.853
AND WHY DOES CHIEF POPE

17:33.886 --> 17:35.655
STILL HAVE THIS ENORMOUS CHIP
ON HIS SHOULDER?

17:35.688 --> 17:37.090
I MEAN,
I'M READY TO PUT BEHIND

17:37.124 --> 17:39.726
HOW COMPLETELY HORRIBLE
HE'S BEEN.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.194
I DON'T EVEN NEED
AN APOLOGY.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.329
I MEAN, CAN'T WE JUST --
YOU KNOW?

17:42.362 --> 17:45.432
YOU MAY BE
ABLE TO LET IT GO,

17:45.465 --> 17:46.799
BUT CHIEF POPE
ISN'T READY TO LET IT GO.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.802
AND IF YOU CAN'T KEEP
RELATIONS FRIENDLY,

17:49.836 --> 17:51.671
YOU NEED
TO KEEP THEM SMART.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.143
WHAT WOULD SMART BE
IN THIS SITUATION?

17:56.176 --> 17:58.145
LETTING CHIEF POPE
RESUME HIS NEGOTIATIONS

17:58.178 --> 18:01.281
WITH THE CHURCH SO THAT
HE SOLVES THE PROBLEM.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.716
HE CAUSED THE PROBLEM.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.191
FINE.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.760
IF I LET CHIEF POPE
GET THE JOURNAL HIS WAY,

18:13.793 --> 18:15.395
WILL HE BACK OFF
ON THAT COMPLAINT?

18:15.428 --> 18:16.829
BECAUSE IF HE SIGNS IT ANYWAY,
I WILL EXPLODE.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.365
I REALLY WILL.

18:18.398 --> 18:21.568
I THINK BEFORE DROPPING
THE COMPLAINT ENTIRELY,

18:21.601 --> 18:23.703
HE'S GONNA WAIT TO SEE

18:23.736 --> 18:25.738
HOW YOU PROCEED WITH
YOUR INVESTIGATION.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.753
EVEN THOUGH THE APARTMENT
HAD BEEN WIPED DOWN,

18:40.787 --> 18:42.889
WE DID FIND
FATHER ADAM'S FINGERPRINTS

18:42.922 --> 18:45.558
IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES --
ONE ON THE TRAVEL MUG...

18:45.592 --> 18:48.295
MRS. WALLINGHAM SAYS SHE MADE
COFFEE FOR HIM THAT NIGHT.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.697
...AND THE CAMERA WE FOUND
IN THE BEDROOM,

18:50.730 --> 18:53.166
INDEX FINGER
ON THE SHUTTER BUTTON.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.236
BUT NO PRINTS ON
THE GIRLS' PHOTOS, CHIEF.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.370
OKAY, SO WHO HUNG THEM UP?
SERGEANT?

18:57.404 --> 18:59.906
WELL, A DR. HANLIN

18:59.939 --> 19:02.442
SUPPOSEDLY CALLED THE RECTORY
THAT NIGHT.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.910
BUT THERE IS NO PHYSICIAN
BY THAT NAME

19:03.943 --> 19:05.678
REGISTERED ANYWHERE
IN THE STATE.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.580
IF THERE'S NOT DOCTOR,
THEN WHO CALLED FOR LAST RITES?

19:07.614 --> 19:08.848
MAYBE THE KILLER.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.417
Flynn: SO, WHY WOULD
THE PRIEST ANSWER A CALL

19:10.450 --> 19:11.918
TO GO TO
HIS OWN APARTMENT?

19:11.951 --> 19:13.720
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.755
Taylor: WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT IF
HE DID HAVE AN ACCOMPLICE?

19:15.788 --> 19:19.392
WHAT IF "LAST RITES"
WAS LIKE A CODE TO SAY
THE PLACE WAS READY?

19:19.426 --> 19:21.828
Provenza:
OH, YOU MEAN LIKE, "I'VE GOT
THE LITTLE GIRLS OVER HERE.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.531
THEY'RE DRINKING WINE COOLERS.
LET'S PARTY"?

19:24.564 --> 19:26.799
Gabriel: YEAH, BUT THERE'S
NO EVIDENCE THE YOUNG GIRLS

19:26.833 --> 19:29.936
WERE EVER IN THE APARTMENT
OTHER THAN THE SCHOOL UNIFORMS,

19:29.969 --> 19:32.272
WHICH WERE BRAND-NEW,
LIKE THE RUG.

19:32.305 --> 19:35.408
THE KILLER PROBABLY BOUGHT
THAT RUG SPECIFICALLY

19:35.442 --> 19:36.609
TO ROLL UP THE BODY,

19:36.643 --> 19:39.412
WHICH MEANS
HE'S HIGHLY ORGANIZED --

19:39.446 --> 19:40.980
SUGGESTS HE WASN'T
A BEGINNER, ANYWAY.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.450
WELL, I'D STILL SAY FATHER ADAM
WENT TO THAT APARTMENT

19:43.483 --> 19:46.219
KNOWING THAT IT WAS
A FAKE CALL.

19:46.253 --> 19:47.987
YOU'RE FORGETTING
ABOUT THE OLIVE OIL.
OLIVE OIL?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.457
ALONG WITH
THE VICTIM'S BLOOD,

19:50.490 --> 19:53.260
THE LAB FOUND A SMALL AMOUNT
OF OLIVE OIL

19:53.293 --> 19:54.794
SOAKED INTO THE RUG.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.896
Sanchez: PRIESTS USE OLIVE OIL
TO PERFORM LAST RITES.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.532
THEY BLESS THE FOREHEAD
AND THEY BLESS THE HANDS.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.534
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THE PRIEST
WAS THERE DOING HIS JOB.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.936
SAYS THE GUY WHO GOES
TO CONFESSION TWICE A WEEK.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.905
OH, YOU SHOULD TRY IT,
ANDREW. IT FEELS GOOD.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.640
HEY, LISTEN.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.542
ALL I KNOW IS THAT THE WOUNDS
TO THE GOOD FATHER'S NECK

20:09.576 --> 20:11.544
ARE UP-CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

20:11.578 --> 20:16.516
YOU ASK ME, SOME ANGRY DAD
FOUND OUT ABOUT THE LOVE NEST

20:16.549 --> 20:18.285
AND PUT AN END TO IT.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.852
IF THE GIRLS WEREN'T BEING
MOLESTED LIKE THE FBI SAID,

20:19.886 --> 20:23.456
FATHERS WOULD HAVE NOTHING
TO BE ANGRY ABOUT.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.525
Flynn: LOOK, TO BE SURE,

20:25.558 --> 20:27.327
I SAY WE GET A WARRANT
FOR THE VICTIM'S JOURNAL.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.761
I MEAN, COME ON.
WHAT ARE WE WAITING ON?
NO, NO, NO.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.298
CHIEF POPE THINKS THAT
WOULD BE LIKE A BOMB GOING OFF.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.866
HI, MAMA. UH, HANG ON
JUST ONE MOMENT.
WE DON'T HAVE THE EVIDENCE.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.468
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
EVIDENCE THAT WE CAN'T COLLECT?

20:35.502 --> 20:36.669
HOW'D IT GO WITH THE DOCTOR?

20:36.703 --> 20:38.305
HE SAYS THINGS
ARE LOOKING UP.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.440
OH, MAMA.
THAT IS SUCH GOOD NEWS.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.442
IT IS! IT IS!

20:42.475 --> 20:44.711
OF COURSE,
THERE'S STILL A WAYS TO GO,

20:44.744 --> 20:47.614
AND SOME OF HIS NUMBERS
COULD USE IMPROVEMENT.

20:47.647 --> 20:51.684
But that doctor of yours
thinks that Clay should be up

20:51.718 --> 20:52.985
AND AT 'EM ANY MINUTE.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.687
HIS NUMBERS?

20:54.721 --> 20:56.456
Oh, on his chart --

20:56.489 --> 20:59.926
HIS ELECTROLYTES
AND SOMETHING ELSE.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.328
OH, THAT'S OKAY, MAMA.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.629
WE'LL GO OVER ALL THAT
AT DINNER.

21:02.662 --> 21:03.696
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.865
OH, BRENDA, ONE MORE THING.
I --

21:09.101 --> 21:10.803
UH, LIEUTENANT TAO,

21:10.837 --> 21:12.805
YOU SAID THAT THE CAMERA
THAT WE FOUND IN THE APARTMENT,

21:12.839 --> 21:15.608
ITS CLOCK
WAS NEVER SET PROPERLY?
Tao: YEAH.

21:15.642 --> 21:18.478
WELL, WE KNOW THEY'RE
RECENT BECAUSE OF WHO
THE GIRLS ARE, BUT --

21:18.511 --> 21:21.381
OKAY, LET'S BLOW UP
THESE PHOTOGRAPHS PLEASE.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.783
I THINK IF THEY WERE
A LITTLE BIT LARGER

21:23.816 --> 21:27.754
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT
TIME OF DAY THEY WERE TAKEN.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.322
AND, UH, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

21:29.356 --> 21:30.857
WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT
OF PHOTOGRAPHS,

21:30.890 --> 21:32.325
WOULD YOU PLEASE HAVE
THE BUILDING MANAGER COME IN

21:32.359 --> 21:34.394
TO LOOK AT A PICTURE
OF FATHER ADAM,

21:34.427 --> 21:36.463
SEE IF HE RECOGNIZES HIM
AS A TENANT.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.665
AND I WANT THE LEASE
IN AN EVIDENCE BAG, PLEASE.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.567
Flynn: SO, WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING, CHIEF?

21:40.600 --> 21:42.469
SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO MAKE
THE PRIEST LOOK DIRTY?

21:42.502 --> 21:45.805
I'M THINKING THAT IF HE DIDN'T
TAKE THESE PHOTOGRAPHS,

21:45.838 --> 21:47.674
IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY HE WENT OUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

21:47.707 --> 21:49.509
TO AN APARTMENT
HE DIDN'T KNOW WAS HIS.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.782
THE GIRLS
IN THE BLUE UNIFORMS

21:55.815 --> 21:57.850
PLAYED ST. ANGELO'S
8th GRADE GIRLS

21:57.884 --> 22:00.587
TWO WEEKS AGO TODAY
BETWEEN 4:30 AND 6:00.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.389
Gabriel:
OKAY, AND AT THAT TIME,

22:02.422 --> 22:03.956
FATHER ADAMS
WAS WITH THE DEBATE TEAM

22:03.990 --> 22:06.993
AT ANOTHER SCHOOL
ACROSS TOWN.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.729
YEAH.
THIS IS INTERESTING.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.664
IT'S QUITE SUNNY, BUT...

22:11.698 --> 22:12.699
NO SHADOWS?
MM-HMM.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.867
SO IT'S MIDDAY,

22:14.901 --> 22:16.603
AND THEY'RE NOT WEARING
THEIR SCHOOL UNIFORMS.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.038
THAT MAKES IT "CASUAL DRESS"
FRIDAY AT ST. ANGELO'S.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.573
AND EVERY FRIDAY AT MIDDAY,

22:20.607 --> 22:22.742
FATHER ADAM PERFORMS MASS
IN THE CATHEDRAL.

22:22.775 --> 22:25.111
SO, HE COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN
THESE PICTURES.
MM-HMM.

22:25.144 --> 22:27.947
CHIEF? THIS IS THE BUILDING
MANAGER, MR. VINCENT MORRIS.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.550
OH, MR. MORRIS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING IN.

22:30.583 --> 22:31.718
AND HERE'S THE LEASE.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.020
WONDERFUL, THANK YOU.
LIEUTENANT.

22:34.053 --> 22:34.954
PRINTS AND COPY
FOR A WRITING SAMPLE?

22:34.987 --> 22:36.489
THANK YOU.
OKAY.

22:36.523 --> 22:39.392
MR. MORRIS,
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN?

22:39.426 --> 22:41.928
I DON'T THINK SO.
HIS NAME'S ON THE LEASE.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.664
OH, WELL, THAT'S NOT THE GUY
WHO SIGNED IT.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.566
AND MARCH 23rd,

22:46.599 --> 22:49.001
IS THAT THE ACTUAL DAY
THE LEASE WAS SIGNED?

22:49.035 --> 22:51.103
MARCH 23rd, THAT'S RIGHT.
MARCH 23rd.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.639
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.674
DO YOU CHANGE THE LOCKS
IN BETWEEN TENANTS?

22:54.707 --> 22:57.877
WELL, I SHOULD, BUT NOT IF
THEY GIVE ME BACK THE KEYS.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.146
COULD YOU GIVE US THE NAME
OF THE PREVIOUS TENANTS?

23:00.179 --> 23:01.848
SURE,
I JUST NEED A COMPUTER.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.150
RIGHT HERE.
OH.

23:04.183 --> 23:07.620
UH, DO YOU ALSO WANT A LIST
OF EXTERMINATOR, PLUMBERS,

23:07.654 --> 23:09.021
PAINTERS, ANYBODY ELSE
WHO COMES IN AND OUT?

23:09.055 --> 23:11.924
THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.192
AND DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

23:13.225 --> 23:16.463
COULD YOU ALSO PULL UP
THE SCHOOL'S WEBSITE,

23:16.496 --> 23:17.730
LOOK THROUGH
THE FACULTY PICTURES,

23:17.764 --> 23:19.499
SEE IF MR. MORRIS
RECOGNIZES ANYONE?

23:19.532 --> 23:21.701
THANK YOU.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.936
UH, I DON'T NEED YOU
FOR THIS.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.204
CHIEF POPE'S ABOUT TO HAVE
A CONFERENCE

23:25.237 --> 23:26.673
WITH THE CHURCH OFFICIAL.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.107
HE WANTS COMMANDER TAYLOR
TO ATTEND.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.842
It's about the journal.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.078
OH, OKAY.
THANK YOU.

23:32.111 --> 23:34.113
FINE.
COMMANDER.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.849
HIS HOLINESS, THE POPE,
REQUESTS YOUR PRESENCE.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.960
AH, FATHER CALHOUN,
YOU KNOW COMMANDER TAYLOR,

23:47.994 --> 23:49.996
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'VE MET
CAPTAIN RAYDOR

23:50.029 --> 23:51.598
OF OUR PROFESSIONAL
STANDARDS BUREAU.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.032
CAPTAIN.

23:53.065 --> 23:55.502
FATHER CALHOUN IS THE SUPERIOR
OF THE PROVINCIAL

23:55.535 --> 23:58.505
FOR ALL JESUIT PRIESTS
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.840
THANK YOU FOR AGREEING
TO MEET WITH US FATHER,

24:00.873 --> 24:03.476
AND MAY I SAY
THAT WE ARE ALL VERY, VERY SORRY

24:03.510 --> 24:05.612
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.914
WE'RE LOOKING TO GET BACK ON
A BETTER FOOTING, AS WELL.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.182
OH, FORGIVE ME,

24:10.216 --> 24:14.086
I WAS REFERRING TO THE TERRIBLE
LOSS OF FATHER ADAM.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.856
MY STUDENT
AND MY BROTHER IN CHRIST.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.626
I ACCEPT YOUR WORDS
OF SYMPATHY,

24:19.659 --> 24:23.730
BUT THE L.A.P.D.'s ACTIONS
SEEM TO UNDERMINE THEIR INTENT.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.065
Pope: WELL, LET ME BEGIN
WITH SOME NEWS

24:26.098 --> 24:28.668
THAT WILL HELP
TO PUT YOUR MIND AT EASE.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.102
AS I UNDERSTAND IT,
WE'RE CURRENTLY FAVORING

24:30.136 --> 24:31.704
A THEORY OF THE CRIME

24:31.738 --> 24:33.873
WHICH WOULD CLEAR FATHER ADAM
OF ANY MISCONDUCT

24:33.906 --> 24:36.776
WITH HIS FEMALE STUDENTS.
THANK HEAVEN.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.679
ANY SUGGESTION HE WAS LEADING
A SECRET LIFE

24:39.712 --> 24:41.247
WOULD HARM HIS LEGACY
FOREVER.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.950
AND YOU COULD HELP US
MAKE SURE THAT NEVER HAPPENS.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.552
HOW?

24:45.585 --> 24:47.186
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE
FATHER ADAM'S JOURNAL.

24:47.219 --> 24:50.256
AND BEFORE YOU SAY NO --
WELL, OF COURSE
YOU CAN SEE IT.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.024
REALLY?
WE CAN?

24:52.058 --> 24:53.092
WHEN?

24:53.125 --> 24:54.961
IN 2052.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.529
40 YEARS FROM NOW,

24:56.563 --> 24:58.230
THE JOURNAL WILL BE UNSEALED
FROM OUR ARCHIVE

24:58.264 --> 24:59.832
AND IT WILL BE ALL YOURS.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.834
WE ONLY WANT IT
FOR A HANDWRITING SAMPLE

25:01.868 --> 25:05.572
TO CONFIRM THAT HE DID NOT RENT
THAT APARTMENT.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.006
YOU ARE TRYING TO BAIT ME
INTO GIVING AWAY

25:07.039 --> 25:09.876
THE INNERMOST THOUGHTS
OF AN ACTIVE-DUTY PRIEST

25:09.909 --> 25:15.147
BY PROMISING ME THAT
IT MAY CLEAR HIS NAME.

25:15.181 --> 25:18.217
THIS WOMAN IS NO BETTER
THAN THE ONE FROM YESTERDAY.

25:21.253 --> 25:24.791
WELL, I GUESS WE MAY NEED
TO GET A WARRANT FOR THE JOURNAL

25:24.824 --> 25:26.025
FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.660
ANY SUCH ATTEMPT
WILL BE MET

25:27.694 --> 25:30.930
WITH THE FULL LEGAL AUTHORITY
OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.932
GIVEN THE CHURCH'S RESOURCES,
CHIEF,

25:32.965 --> 25:35.935
I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY ASK
TO CONVENE A GRAND JURY.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.804
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
HAS GROWN USED TO THOSE

25:37.837 --> 25:39.672
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS,
I SHOULD THINK.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.841
Taylor: OF COURSE, A GRAND JURY
WOULD HAVE TO SEE THE PICTURES

25:41.874 --> 25:43.142
OF THOSE LITTLE GIRLS

25:43.175 --> 25:45.778
AND THE FINGERPRINT
ON THE CAMERA,

25:45.812 --> 25:47.980
NOT TO MENTION
ALL THOSE KIDS' CLOTHES

25:48.014 --> 25:49.215
WE FOUND IN THE APARTMENT.

25:49.248 --> 25:52.852
YOU JUST TOLD ME
YOU WERE PURSUING

25:52.885 --> 25:54.687
AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY
OF THE CRIME.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.689
YES.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.025
BUT THE EVIDENCE
IS STILL THE EVIDENCE.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.027
Pope: LOOK,
I-I'M SURE THERE'S SOME WAY

26:01.060 --> 26:04.296
THAT WE CAN EXAMINE
THIS JOURNAL

26:04.330 --> 26:05.698
WITHOUT INVOLVING
THE COURTS

26:05.732 --> 26:08.300
OR COMPROMISING
CONFIDENTIALITY.

26:08.334 --> 26:11.003
FATHER, SUPPOSE WE HAD IT
FOR JUST ONE DAY,

26:11.037 --> 26:15.274
AND THE JOURNAL NEVER LEFT
YOUR PRESENCE.

26:15.307 --> 26:18.077
SO, TECHNICALLY, IT WAS
NEVER RELEASED TO ANYONE.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.086
ONE DAY?

26:27.119 --> 26:28.988
Brenda: WE'RE JUST AS INTERESTED
IN ISSUES OF PRIVILEGE

26:29.021 --> 26:32.391
AS YOU ARE AND I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING SPECIFIC TO LOOK FOR.

26:32.424 --> 26:37.163
SO, WHY DON'T I THROW OUT A DATE
AND YOU SEE WHAT IT SAYS,

26:37.196 --> 26:38.898
AND WHETHER
WE CAN LOOK AT IT.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.233
AND THEN WE'LL DO
A HANDWRITING COMPARISON.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.037
WHAT DATE?

26:45.071 --> 26:49.175
HOW ABOUT MARCH 23rd?

26:56.849 --> 27:03.089
HE WAS TRAVELING THAT DAY
TO A CONFERENCE IN SAN DIEGO.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.091
HE WRITES BRIEFLY
ABOUT THE TRAIN RIDE.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.395
UH, EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.230
I SHOWED
THE APARTMENT MANAGER

27:11.263 --> 27:13.099
ALL THE FACULTY PICTURES
FROM FATHER ADAM'S SCHOOL.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.333
YOU DID WHAT?

27:14.366 --> 27:16.202
Brenda: OH, ROUTINE PROCEDURE,
FATHER.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.937
JUST ELIMINATING
ALL THE POSSIBILITIES.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.138
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.973
AND HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THEM.

27:21.007 --> 27:22.809
AND NONE OF THE FORMER TENANTS
OR WORKERS

27:22.842 --> 27:24.010
HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.879
OKAY, I'M NOT SEEING
ANYTHING SIMILAR

27:26.913 --> 27:29.315
BETWEEN
THESE TWO SAMPLES.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.784
FATHER,
THIS IS ALL GOOD NEWS.

27:31.818 --> 27:34.320
CHIEF, UH,
I HAVE THE FINGERPRINT REPORT

27:34.353 --> 27:35.387
FROM THE ORIGINAL LEASE.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.056
WE HAVE MATCHES

27:37.089 --> 27:38.357
FROM ALL THE SQUAD
WHO TOUCHED IT THIS MORNING

27:38.390 --> 27:40.092
AND, OF COURSE,
THE MANAGER, MR. MORRIS,

27:40.126 --> 27:43.229
BUT NO PRINTS
FROM FATHER ADAM.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.899
OH, MY.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.735
SEE? SHARING THIS JOURNAL
WITH US

27:48.768 --> 27:50.136
IS GOING TO HELP YOU
ENORMOUSLY.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.938
PARDON ME, FATHER.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.906
DO YOU MIND WAITING HERE
FOR A MOMENT?

27:53.940 --> 27:55.742
CERTAINLY.
CERTAINLY.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.847
WHERE'S MR. MORRIS?

28:00.880 --> 28:02.148
HE LEFT 10 MINUTES AGO.

28:03.783 --> 28:04.951
DID HE WRITE ANYTHING
IN LONGHAND WHILE HE WAS HERE?

28:04.984 --> 28:07.419
OH, I TOOK
ALL THE NOTES, CHIEF.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.121
HE HAD ACCESS TO THAT APARTMENT
24 HOURS A DAY.

28:09.155 --> 28:10.957
WHO ELSE COULD SET IT UP
LIKE THAT?

28:10.990 --> 28:13.760
AND THERE ARE NO PRINTS
BUT OURS AND HIS ON THAT LEASE?

28:13.793 --> 28:16.896
LET'S FIND OUT IF OUR LANDLORD
HAD A CRIMINAL RECORD.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.098
THANK YOU.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.500
FATHER CALHOUN,
WOULD YOU BE WILLING

28:21.533 --> 28:23.502
TO LOOK THROUGH THE JOURNAL
FOR THE NAME OF A MAN

28:23.535 --> 28:25.171
NAMED MORRIS?

28:25.204 --> 28:26.906
HE MAY HAVE BEEN IMPERSONATING
FATHER ADAM.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.140
YES, OF COURSE.

28:28.174 --> 28:31.310
BUT THERE'S AN ENTIRE BOX
OF JOURNALS.

28:31.343 --> 28:35.481
UH, I'D SAY MAYBE WE START
WITH MARCH 23rd

28:35.514 --> 28:37.817
AND WORK OUR WAY BACK
FROM THERE?

28:37.850 --> 28:39.118
SOUND GOOD?

28:44.190 --> 28:47.894
WELL, THE MANAGER DOESN'T HAVE
A RECORD EXACTLY,

28:47.927 --> 28:50.162
BUT HIS NAME DID COME UP
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.331
FIRST, AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS RELATES,

28:52.364 --> 28:54.366
BUT ACCORDING TO
A TRAFFIC-ACCIDENT REPORT,

28:54.400 --> 28:56.335
MR. MORRIS
WAS CRITICALLY INJURED

28:56.368 --> 28:58.437
IN A NASTY FIVE-CAR PILEUP
ON THE FREEWAY

28:58.470 --> 29:00.873
THAT NEARLY KILLED HIM
SIX MONTHS AGO.

29:00.907 --> 29:03.009
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

29:03.042 --> 29:06.312
VINCENT MORRIS FILED
A MISSING PERSONS ON HIS WIFE

29:06.345 --> 29:07.446
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.115
AND SHE NEVER TURNED UP.

29:09.148 --> 29:12.251
AT THE TIME, THE ONLY LEAD
THE L.A.P.D. UNCOVERED

29:12.284 --> 29:14.854
WAS A CONDOMINIUM
RENTED UNDER HIS WIFE'S NAME

29:14.887 --> 29:16.422
IN CABO SAN LUCAS.

29:16.455 --> 29:19.091
BUT THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES
NEVER FOUND ANYONE LIVING THERE.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.427
BACK WHEN MORRIS' WIFE
FIRST DISAPPEARED,

29:21.460 --> 29:23.329
THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER
MADE A NOTE

29:23.362 --> 29:25.531
OF A LARGE AREA RUG MISSING
FROM THE MORRIS HOME.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.867
TWO ABANDONED APARTMENTS
COULD BE A COINCIDENCE,

29:27.900 --> 29:29.501
BUT THE MISSING RUG
MAKES IT A PATTERN.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.370
LET--

29:31.403 --> 29:35.975
OH, UM...PUT A WATCH
ON MR. MORRIS

29:36.008 --> 29:37.910
AND LET ME KNOW
IF FATHER CALHOUN

29:37.944 --> 29:39.578
FINDS HIS NAME IN THE JOURNAL.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.580
AND I WANT EVERY DETAIL
OF THE DAY OF THAT CAR ACCIDENT.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.050
YES, MAMA.
I'M ON MY WAY.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.418
THAT'S FINE,
BUT I'LL BE THERE.

29:46.452 --> 29:47.519
CHIEF.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.288
THANK YOU.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.928
HERE'S A GOOD ONE
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

29:55.962 --> 29:58.330
THE LOW THYRO--

29:58.364 --> 30:00.499
THYROGLOBULIN.

30:00.532 --> 30:04.003
LOW MEANS ITS CANCER'S
BASICALLY UNDETECTABLE.

30:04.036 --> 30:07.606
OH, DADDY. YOU'RE GETTING
TO BE SUCH AN EXPERT.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.341
WELL, I'LL SAY THIS
FOR THAT DOCTOR OF YOURS.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.410
HE TALKS TO US
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND HIM.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.980
LOOK HERE.
LOOK AT THIS.

30:16.348 --> 30:17.950
I GOT MY BALANCE BACK.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.418
OOH!

30:19.451 --> 30:21.387
Fritz: NOW, YOU JUST TEACH
YOUR DAUGHTER

30:21.420 --> 30:23.455
HOW TO CARRY HER STUFF
BACK INTO THE KITCHEN...
HEY.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.858
DON'T ASK FOR MORE
THAN GOD CAN GIVE YOU.

30:27.393 --> 30:31.463
DEAR, I'LL TAKE THE HEAVY
PLATES. YOU TAKE THE SILVERWARE.

30:31.497 --> 30:32.932
HELLO.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.466
YES -- UH, HANG ON.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.003
YOU WERE RIGHT.
HE DID NEED A BETTER DOCTOR.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.270
OH, THANK HEAVEN
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.372
THANK HEAVEN.
UH...

30:40.406 --> 30:42.208
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
OH, HI.

30:42.241 --> 30:43.442
HEY, CHIEF.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.511
UH, SO, WE DIDN'T FIND
MR. MORRIS' NAME

30:45.544 --> 30:47.046
ANYWHERE IN THE JOURNAL,

30:47.079 --> 30:49.048
BUT WE DID FIND THE NAMES
OF HIS TWO SONS --

30:49.081 --> 30:50.549
DAVID AND MICHAEL MORRIS.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.484
HIS SONS? WHAT DID THEY
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

30:52.518 --> 30:54.586
WELL, I'M NOT SURE,
BUT THE DATE OF THE ENTRY

30:54.620 --> 30:57.123
IS THE SAME DAY MR. MORRIS
WAS BROUGHT TO THE HOSPITAL

30:57.156 --> 30:58.390
AFTER HIS BIG CAR WRECK.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.926
WAS FATHER ADAM THERE?

30:59.959 --> 31:01.193
YEAH. I CHECKED
WITH THE HOSPITAL.

31:01.227 --> 31:02.995
HE WAS ON CALL ALL DAY.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.596
YEAH, BUT WHY WOULD HE
WRITE DOWN THE SONS' NAMES?

31:04.630 --> 31:07.599
UH, WHY WOULD HE WRITE DOWN
THE SONS' NAMES?

31:07.633 --> 31:10.202
UH, CHIEF,
WHEN GIVEN LAST RITES,

31:10.236 --> 31:12.204
DYING PATIENTS
OFTEN ASK PRIESTS

31:12.238 --> 31:14.073
TO PASS MESSAGES
ON TO FAMILY MEMBERS,

31:14.106 --> 31:16.542
BUT FATHER ADAM
DIDN'T WRITE THE MESSAGE DOWN.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.245
WELL, WHY NOT? WHY IS EVERYONE
ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE

31:19.278 --> 31:22.081
ABOUT THIS JOURNAL
IF THERE'S NOTHING IN IT?!

31:22.114 --> 31:24.050
OH, YEAH, YEAH, CHIEF.
CRAZY.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.151
OH, HERE, FLYNN.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.319
UH, HEY, CHIEF.

31:27.353 --> 31:31.057
I CHECKED INTO
MR. MORRIS' PLATES, JUST TO SEE,

31:31.090 --> 31:33.592
AND HIS CAR WAS TOWED LAST NIGHT
ABOUT 30 MILES FROM HIS HOME.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.462
HE CHECKED IT OUT
OF IMPOUND THIS MORNING.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.931
30 MILES?
WHERE?

31:38.965 --> 31:41.467
WAS IT PARKED NEAR SOMEPLACE
WHERE YOU COULD DO A BODY DUMP?

31:41.500 --> 31:42.534
WELL,
WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT.

31:42.568 --> 31:43.602
WHERE'S MORRIS NOW?

31:43.635 --> 31:45.271
Well,
Provenza's got S.I.S.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.106
SITTING AT HIS HOUSE
READY TO GRAB HIM.

31:47.139 --> 31:51.410
ONLY ONE DAY.
I-I-I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.

31:51.443 --> 31:52.544
BRING MR. MORRIS IN.
I WANT TO HAVE A CHAT WITH HIM.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.113
I'M ON MY WAY.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.648
BRENDA, YOU HAVE TO GO BACK
TO WORK AT THIS HOUR?

31:56.682 --> 32:00.452
MAMA, I AM SO SORRY,
BUT I'VE GOT A DEADLINE.

32:00.486 --> 32:03.055
HMM, I THOUGHT SINCE CLAY
WAS FEELING BETTER,

32:03.089 --> 32:05.357
YOU AND I COULD HAVE
A LITTLE TALK.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.959
AND WE WILL. WE WILL.

32:06.993 --> 32:10.696
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING
I REALLY OUGHT TO TELL YOU.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.198
IT'LL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.732
WELL, C-CAN IT WAIT
TILL TOMORROW MORNING?

32:13.765 --> 32:16.302
WE COULD HAVE BREAKFAST AND TALK
ABOUT WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.171
ALL RIGHT. TOMORROW.

32:19.205 --> 32:22.274
ONLY, HONEY, YOU CAN'T
KEEP WORKING LIKE THIS
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

32:22.308 --> 32:24.143
IT'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.412
I EXPECT IT WILL.
BUT NOT TONIGHT.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.513
BYE.
MM.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.416
DRIVE CAREFULLY.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.621
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

32:35.654 --> 32:38.557
CHIEF, WE GOT MR. MORRIS
IN INTERVIEW ROOM 1.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.392
Tao: I HAVE THE FULL REPORT
ON FATHER ADAM'S VEHICLE

32:40.426 --> 32:42.161
BACK FROM THE PRINT SHED.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.429
LOOK AT THIS DETAIL.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.035
FATHER ADAM'S CAR
WAS OUT OF GAS.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.403
WARNING LIGHT WAS ON,
LESS THAN A GALLON LEFT.

32:51.437 --> 32:54.073
A CAR THAT SIZE, THAT
AGE, YOU CAN ONLY GO
ANOTHER 6, 7 MILES.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.741
THAT'S WHEN THAT CREEP MORRIS'
PLAN WENT WRONG.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.677
HERE'S A MAP OF WHERE
HE LEFT HIS CAR.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.146
THAT'S WHY HIS CAR
WAS TOWED.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.513
HE COULDN'T DRIVE BACK TO IT

33:01.547 --> 33:04.016
BECAUSE THE PRIEST'S CAR
WAS RUNNING ON EMPTY.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.317
AND MORRIS DIDN'T DARE
FILL UP

33:05.351 --> 33:07.086
FOR FEAR OF GAS-STATION
SECURITY CAMERAS.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.488
OKAY,
SO HE MEANT TO DRIVE HERE,

33:09.521 --> 33:12.124
DUMP THE PRIEST'S CAR
AND HIS BODY,

33:12.158 --> 33:13.425
AND THEN DRIVE
HIS OWN VEHICLE HOME.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.294
MORRIS PLANNED FOR EVERYTHING

33:15.327 --> 33:16.728
EXCEPT THAT POOR PRIEST'S CAR
RUNNING OUT OF GAS.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.230
HE NEVER INTENDED TO DUMP
THE BODY AT THE SCHOOL.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.099
Provenza: YEAH,
IT WAS A GOOD SAVE THOUGH,

33:20.132 --> 33:21.767
'CAUSE IT MADE THE PRIEST
LOOK GUILTIER.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.602
Gabriel: THIS MIGHT
BE SOMETHING CHIEF.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.404
THERE IS A LARGE
STORAGE FACILITY

33:25.437 --> 33:27.273
THREE BLOCKS FROM
WHERE MORRIS LEFT HIS CAR

33:27.306 --> 33:28.774
JUST OFF THE FREEWAY EXIT.

33:28.807 --> 33:31.643
HE WOULDN'T USE HIS OWN NAME
AT THAT STORAGE FACILITY,

33:31.677 --> 33:33.245
BUT Y'ALL GET DOWN THERE

33:33.279 --> 33:34.746
AND TAKE THIS FAKE
APARTMENT LEASE WITH YOU,

33:34.780 --> 33:36.582
SEE IF YOU CAN MATCH
THE HANDWRITING TO A CONTRACT

33:36.615 --> 33:39.518
FROM EIGHT YEARS AGO AROUND
THE TIME THE WIFE WENT MISSING.

33:39.551 --> 33:42.688
Provenza: WELL, A MATCH
LIKE THAT MIGHT SATISFY GOD,

33:42.721 --> 33:45.691
BUT I THINK A JUDGE IS GONNA
WANT MORE FOR A WARRANT.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.227
WELL, THEN TAKE THE CADAVER DOG
WITH YOU FOR INSURANCE.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.496
AND, BUZZ, LEAVE YOUR CAMERA
WITH LIEUTENANT TAO, PLEASE.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.664
I NEED YOU HERE
TO HELP ME.
SURE THING.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.666
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

33:54.700 --> 33:56.735
FEEL LIKE HELPING ME CATCH
A PRIEST KILLER?

33:58.270 --> 34:00.406
MY CAR DIED, SO I CALLED A CAB
TO GET HOME.

34:00.439 --> 34:03.142
I DIDN'T READ THE SIGN
PROPERLY IN THE DARK,

34:03.175 --> 34:04.643
AND IT GOT TOWED.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.212
IS THAT A CRIME?

34:07.379 --> 34:09.381
NO, IT'S NOT.

34:09.415 --> 34:12.084
BUT YOU DO SEEM TO BE HAVING
A LOT OF CAR TROUBLE RECENTLY.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.687
SIX MONTHS AGO,
YOU GOT INTO A FREEWAY CRASH.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.623
I'M FINE NOW.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.692
YES, YOU ARE.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.362
ACCORDING TO
THE ACCIDENT REPORT,

34:23.395 --> 34:26.532
THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED
ON THAT DAY.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.700
CLOSE CALL.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.402
CLOSE ENOUGH
TO CALL A PRIEST.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.174
SIR, WE KNOW YOU CONFESSED
TO FATHER ADAM.

34:35.207 --> 34:38.244
YOU WERE GONNA DIE.
YOU ASKED FOR LAST RITES.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.545
HE WROTE IT DOWN.

34:39.578 --> 34:40.812
I SINCERELY DOUBT THAT.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.881
IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION
OF HIS VOWS.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.583
OH, OH, SO YOU ARE
CATHOLIC, THEN?

34:44.616 --> 34:47.586
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?

34:47.619 --> 34:49.855
PLENTY OF PEOPLE TALK TO PRIESTS
IN HOSPITALS.

34:49.888 --> 34:53.359
THIS PRIEST WAS KILLED
IN ONE OF YOUR APARTMENTS.

34:53.392 --> 34:56.495
WELL,
THAT'S A SAD COINCIDENCE,

34:56.528 --> 34:58.697
BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE GUY.

34:58.730 --> 35:01.567
DO YOU REMEMBER GIVING HIM
THE NAME OF YOUR SONS?

35:01.600 --> 35:04.303
AFTER YOU CONFESSED,
WERE YOU THOUGHTFUL ENOUGH

35:04.336 --> 35:06.572
TO LEAVE A MESSAGE
FOR THOSE BOYS?

35:06.605 --> 35:08.874
ABOUT A SECRET YOU'VE KEPT
FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS?

35:22.754 --> 35:25.591
YOU SAID SOMETHING TO
FATHER ADAM ON YOUR DEATH BED.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.693
EXCEPT YOU DIDN'T DIE.

35:27.726 --> 35:30.796
THAT MADE YOU ANXIOUS,
DIDN'T IT?

35:30.829 --> 35:33.799
BECAUSE FATHER ADAM
WAS URGING YOU TO CONFESS AGAIN,

35:33.832 --> 35:35.767
TO US, MAYBE.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.270
CONFESS WHAT?

35:39.438 --> 35:40.539
WELL, YOU COULD TELL US
WHAT YOU DID

35:40.572 --> 35:42.408
TO THE MOTHER OF YOUR SONS.

35:53.952 --> 35:55.821
OR YOU COULD TELL US

35:55.854 --> 35:58.557
THAT AFTER REALIZING
YOU'D CONFESSED TOO SOON

35:58.590 --> 35:59.925
AND YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO DIE,

35:59.958 --> 36:03.729
YOU LURED THE NOW INCONVENIENT
FATHER ADAM

36:03.762 --> 36:05.864
TO AN APARTMENT
YOU HAD SET UP TO KILL HIM

36:05.897 --> 36:08.367
AND RUIN HIS GOOD NAME.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.670
HOW YOU PUT HIS DEAD FINGER
ON THE CAMERA SHUTTER

36:11.703 --> 36:14.840
AND ROLLED HIM UP IN A RUG
JUST LIKE YOU DID YOUR WIFE.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.748
IF YOU THINK I'M GONNA
CONFESS TO ALL OF THAT,

36:22.781 --> 36:23.849
YOU'RE CRAZY.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.786
WATSON: Chief, they found
his wife's body.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.422
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D TELL US
WHAT YOU TOLD FATHER ADAM.

36:30.456 --> 36:33.425
FOR ONE THING,
I CAN'T ABSOLVE YOU.

36:33.459 --> 36:35.827
GOD SEES EVERYTHING.

36:38.364 --> 36:40.766
DOES GOD SEE THAT YOU HAVE
NO EVIDENCE?

36:45.371 --> 36:47.339
LOOK.

36:47.373 --> 36:50.876
SINCE YOU'VE ALREADY
READ ME MY RIGHTS,

36:50.909 --> 36:53.445
I THINK IT'S TIME
I CALL AN ATTORNEY.

36:54.813 --> 36:57.483
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.
SIR.

37:02.754 --> 37:05.591
THE NEXT TIME YOU RECEIVE
LAST RITES,

37:05.624 --> 37:07.926
I'LL BE THERE
IN THE VIEWING ROOM,

37:07.959 --> 37:10.796
PROBABLY STANDING
NEXT TO YOUR TWO SONS.

37:10.829 --> 37:11.963
YOU MAKE SURE YOU WAVE

37:11.997 --> 37:13.699
BEFORE THEY PUT THE NEEDLE
IN YOUR ARM.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.502
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.304
Brenda:
WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.872
AND, UH, SIR,
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.574
WE FOUND YOUR WIFE.

37:30.682 --> 37:34.286
SHE CLEARED THE CHURCH.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.688
THAT MAKES YOU GOOD
WITH FATHER CALHOUN

37:36.722 --> 37:39.691
AND THE ARCHBISHOP,
SO...

37:39.725 --> 37:42.494
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
WITH THIS COMPLAINT?

37:56.342 --> 37:57.576
HEY.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.811
WILL, I'M --

37:59.845 --> 38:01.713
LOOK.

38:01.747 --> 38:05.717
I'M...VERY SORRY ABOUT BARGING
INTO THE RECTORY YESTERDAY.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.453
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

38:07.486 --> 38:11.357
I MEAN...THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THE APOLOGY.

38:11.390 --> 38:14.426
I DO, BUT THAT'S NOT
THE REAL ISSUE HERE.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.061
WHAT IS?

38:16.094 --> 38:18.697
THE REAL ISSUE IS
I'M GONNA BE MOVING UPSTAIRS

38:18.730 --> 38:20.699
TO RUN THIS WHOLE DEPARTMENT
IN MY OWN RIGHT,

38:20.732 --> 38:22.834
AND I'M NOT GONNA BE
AROUND TO...

38:22.868 --> 38:24.636
WATCH OVER YOU ANYMORE.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.773
YOU KNOW?

38:29.508 --> 38:32.010
AFRAID I'LL BURN
THE PLACE DOWN?

38:32.043 --> 38:33.879
NO.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.381
NO.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.583
I'M -- I'M AFRAID
YOU'LL BURN YOURSELF UP.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.084
YOU KNOW?

38:39.117 --> 38:41.953
SOMEBODY'S GONNA BE REPLACING ME
AS ASSISTANT CHIEF --

38:41.987 --> 38:43.522
YOUR IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR.

38:43.555 --> 38:45.691
I THINK WE KNOW WHO THAT
SOMEBODY IS LIKELY TO BE,

38:45.724 --> 38:47.559
AND HE'S NOT GONNA SPEND
A LOT OF TIME

38:47.593 --> 38:48.894
PUTTING UP WITH
THE KIND OF CRAP

38:48.927 --> 38:51.697
I'VE LET YOU GET AWAY WITH
OVER THE YEARS.

38:51.730 --> 38:55.434
THIS WAS JUST ANOTHER ATTEMPT
TO TRY TO CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE,

38:55.467 --> 38:58.036
WHICH...WASN'T GONNA WORK
ANYWAY, SO...

38:59.738 --> 39:01.740
BESIDES, YOU DON'T WANT
THIS COMPLAINT ON YOUR RECORD,

39:01.773 --> 39:04.976
JUST IN CASE YOU NEED TO THINK
ABOUT CIRCULATING YOUR RéSUMé.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.433
GOOD MORNING, DARLING.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.734
DADDY, ARE YOU
MAKING BREAKFAST?

39:28.767 --> 39:30.001
YEAH, PANCAKES.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.637
I'M LETTING YOUR MOTHER
SLEEP IN.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.071
SHE'S DONE ENOUGH
THIS PAST SIX MONTHS.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.906
OH, THAT'S JUST ABOUT
THE BEST THING

39:34.940 --> 39:36.975
A PERSON
COULD COME HOME TO.

39:37.008 --> 39:39.545
WELL, PANCAKES
ARE A WONDERFUL THING.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.680
NOW I JUST NEED TO STAY AWAKE
LONG ENOUGH TO EAT 'EM.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.849
GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.451
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS?
HEY.

39:45.484 --> 39:46.652
YEAH, I KNOW.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.787
I THINK IT CALLS
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.689
ALREADY MADE.
HELP YOURSELF.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.859
OH, BRENDA LEIGH, TAKE
YOUR MOTHER A CUP, WOULD YOU?

39:53.892 --> 39:55.427
SHE SAID SOMETHING LAST NIGHT

39:55.461 --> 39:57.095
ABOUT WANTING TO TALK TO YOU
THIS MORNING.

39:57.128 --> 39:59.431
RIGHT.

39:59.465 --> 40:01.099
TAKE MINE.
WELCOME HOME.

40:01.132 --> 40:04.102
THANK YOU.

40:04.135 --> 40:07.138
OH, AND TELL HER BREAKFAST
IN 10 MINUTES.

40:07.172 --> 40:10.075
YES, SIR.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.811
Clay: YOU SLEEP WELL
LAST NIGHT?

40:12.844 --> 40:14.212
OKAY.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.548
WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER
TOSSING AROUND NEXT TO YOU?

40:16.582 --> 40:18.684
MAMA, YOU AWAKE?

40:18.717 --> 40:20.819
OH,
I HATE TO WAKE YOU UP,

40:20.852 --> 40:22.220
BUT DADDY SAID BREAKFAST
IN 10 MINUTES,

40:22.253 --> 40:24.756
WHICH PROBABLY MEANS 15.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.925
MAMA?

40:26.958 --> 40:29.528
I-I'M GONNA PUT
YOUR COFFEE DOWN HERE,

40:29.561 --> 40:32.197
AND YOU CAN HAVE IT
WHEN YOU'RE READY, OKAY?

40:40.672 --> 40:42.774
MAMA, WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND GET UP NOW.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.543
WE'LL TALK.

41:17.776 --> 41:20.178
FRITZ!!

41:20.211 --> 41:22.080
FRITZ!!

41:22.113 --> 41:23.649
WHAT
FRITZ!!

41:23.682 --> 41:26.518
MAMA, LOOK!
WHAT HAPPENED?!

41:26.552 --> 41:28.887
WHAT HAPPENED?!
FRITZI, HELP HER!

41:28.920 --> 41:31.523
HELP HER! HELP HER!
NO!

41:31.557 --> 41:34.593
NO! MAMA, PLEASE, NO!

41:34.626 --> 41:36.261
MAMA! MAMA!
