WEBVTT

00:02.660 --> 00:06.262
(vehicle rumbling)

00:06.264 --> 00:08.164
Good-bye, John.
JOHN:<i> Wren!</i>

00:08.166 --> 00:09.932
(tires screeching)

00:09.934 --> 00:12.001
(amplified heartbeat)

00:18.176 --> 00:19.241
(tires screech)

00:19.243 --> 00:20.843
(horn honks)

00:20.845 --> 00:22.845
(tires screech)

00:22.847 --> 00:24.847
(people murmuring)

00:24.849 --> 00:26.482
¶ ¶

00:29.454 --> 00:31.687
MAN: She ran out
in the middle of the road.

00:31.689 --> 00:34.256
I never had a
chance to stop.

00:40.531 --> 00:42.665
WOMAN:
She's dead.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.307
JOHN:
<i>It's time to make him stop.</i>

00:51.309 --> 00:54.009
WREN:<i> I really like you.</i>
<i>I hate to see it end.</i>

00:55.480 --> 00:57.346
(siren wailing in distance)

01:08.993 --> 01:11.694
(sniffles, sighs)

01:14.665 --> 01:17.199
(sighs)

01:20.304 --> 01:22.138
Where is he?

01:22.140 --> 01:23.606
Where's who?

01:23.608 --> 01:25.141
That monster
you've all been protecting.

01:25.143 --> 01:26.575
The Ten Commandments Killer.

01:26.577 --> 01:28.077
He's here! Wren told me.

01:28.079 --> 01:29.111
Wren?

01:29.113 --> 01:31.113
That girl is full of lies.

01:31.115 --> 01:34.650
She's dead. She killed herself
trying to protect him.

01:34.652 --> 01:36.252
Well...

01:36.254 --> 01:39.522
she was old enough to
make her own choices.

01:41.459 --> 01:43.192
Where is he?

01:43.194 --> 01:46.128
I swear to God, asshole,

01:46.130 --> 01:48.597
you touch me
one more time,

01:48.599 --> 01:52.501
I will cut your throat
while you sleep!

01:52.503 --> 01:54.003
John.

01:54.005 --> 01:56.772
What the hell
are you doing?

01:56.774 --> 01:59.141
The man I've been hunting
is in this hotel.

01:59.143 --> 02:00.643
She knows it!

02:00.645 --> 02:02.912
You know it!
I'm tired of being lied to!

02:10.288 --> 02:11.954
Fine.

02:11.956 --> 02:14.523
You want to know where the
Ten Commandments Killer

02:14.525 --> 02:16.592
has been hiding?

02:19.163 --> 02:21.230
I'll take you there.

02:31.475 --> 02:34.009
You might want to
take this with you.

02:34.011 --> 02:37.580
In case you find
what you're looking for.

02:55.666 --> 02:57.499
Is this a joke?

02:57.501 --> 03:00.269
You're telling me
he's in this room?

03:02.240 --> 03:04.540
I'm telling you
there are answers

03:04.542 --> 03:07.142
on the other side of this door.

03:20.925 --> 03:22.925
This used to be
where his office was.

03:22.927 --> 03:24.927
Did you know that?

03:24.929 --> 03:26.962
James Patrick March.

03:28.933 --> 03:31.100
Many years ago.

03:31.102 --> 03:32.534
James March is dead.

03:32.536 --> 03:34.436
In fact,
this is where he died.

03:34.438 --> 03:37.273
February 25

03:37.275 --> 03:39.508
at 2:25 in the morning.

03:40.945 --> 03:43.312
(alarm clock clicks,
plays music)

03:43.314 --> 03:45.414
(whispers): We don't
have to do this.

03:45.416 --> 03:47.583
We can turn around

03:47.585 --> 03:50.019
and walk out of
here right now.

03:51.956 --> 03:55.958
Go to the bar, have
a couple drinks.

03:55.960 --> 03:56.992
(gasps)

03:56.994 --> 03:59.895
Why did you bring me back here?!

04:02.600 --> 04:04.566
Behind the armoire.

04:08.472 --> 04:11.473
That's where you'll find
what you're looking for.

04:11.475 --> 04:13.542
¶ ¶

04:35.366 --> 04:37.433
(door creaking)

04:55.453 --> 04:57.386
Jesus.

05:00.324 --> 05:02.458
How long has this been here?

05:02.460 --> 05:05.461
Since the beginning.

05:11.168 --> 05:12.868
The hand of a thief.

05:12.870 --> 05:15.871
"Thou shalt not steal."

05:17.141 --> 05:18.841
JOHN:
Dead thief, cut off his hands.

05:18.843 --> 05:21.477
That was the first one.

05:21.479 --> 05:24.046
1926.

05:24.048 --> 05:25.514
"Remember the
Sabbath day

05:25.516 --> 05:27.683
to keep it holy."

05:27.685 --> 05:29.251
Teeth...

05:29.253 --> 05:31.920
<i>harvested from a field</i>
<i>of migrant workers.</i>

05:31.922 --> 05:35.491
"Thou shall not worship
false idols."

05:35.493 --> 05:37.693
What was left

05:37.695 --> 05:38.727
of Martin Gamboa's brain...

05:39.530 --> 05:41.397
...after his skull

05:41.399 --> 05:43.031
was bashed open.

05:43.033 --> 05:44.933
No serial killer
has a 90-year lull.

05:44.935 --> 05:46.201
If it's taken him

05:46.203 --> 05:48.437
this long to find a successor.

05:48.439 --> 05:50.372
Someone...

05:50.374 --> 05:52.341
to complete his work.

05:52.343 --> 05:54.443
"Thou shall not

05:54.445 --> 05:55.878
commit adultery."

05:55.880 --> 05:58.747
James Briggs' tongue and eyes

05:58.749 --> 06:02.351
<i>taken while he was still alive.</i>
JOHN:<i> That's bullshit.</i>

06:02.353 --> 06:05.053
The parts cut out
of James Briggs are in the lab.

06:05.055 --> 06:06.755
I catalogued it myself.

06:09.293 --> 06:11.427
"Honor thy mother

06:11.429 --> 06:12.895
and thy father."

06:12.897 --> 06:15.597
The hearts of two
ungrateful children.

06:15.599 --> 06:18.033
They murdered both
of their parents

06:18.035 --> 06:19.601
<i>in order to inherit</i>
<i>the family fortune.</i>

06:19.603 --> 06:21.970
JOHN:
The Rylance twins.

06:21.972 --> 06:24.640
"Thou shalt not bear
false witness."

06:24.642 --> 06:27.109
Gossip mongers.

06:27.111 --> 06:28.977
<i>After he nailed</i>

06:28.979 --> 06:30.746
their slanderous tongues
to their desks,

06:30.748 --> 06:33.982
he ripped out their vocal cords.

06:33.984 --> 06:36.385
"Thou shalt
not take

06:36.387 --> 06:38.220
the Lord's name in vain."

06:38.222 --> 06:39.388
(sniffles)

06:41.325 --> 06:43.091
A false prophet who would go

06:43.093 --> 06:46.595
<i>on television</i>
<i>and vent his spleen.</i>

06:46.597 --> 06:48.397
So the killer
took it.

06:48.399 --> 06:49.798
(exhales)

06:49.800 --> 06:51.233
(softly):
John.

06:51.235 --> 06:52.634
He...

06:52.636 --> 06:54.336
He would have had to
have been bringing

06:54.338 --> 06:56.004
these things back while
I was still here.

06:56.006 --> 06:58.607
Who let him in?

06:58.609 --> 07:01.076
Nobody let him in.

07:02.980 --> 07:04.813
He had a key.

07:05.983 --> 07:07.983
(whispers):
What?

07:07.985 --> 07:08.984
Take my hand.

07:08.986 --> 07:09.985
What?

07:09.987 --> 07:12.988
John, take my hand.

07:12.990 --> 07:16.291
It's okay, baby.

07:16.293 --> 07:19.261
It's all okay, baby.

07:19.263 --> 07:22.764
You're here with me.

07:22.766 --> 07:23.765
(sniffles)

07:23.767 --> 07:25.601
With your Sally.

07:25.603 --> 07:26.768
We are almost there.

07:26.770 --> 07:28.504
There's just a little more work
left to do.

07:28.506 --> 07:30.372
No. No.
John, John, John.

07:30.374 --> 07:32.307
Stay with me. Stay.
No, it's not true.

07:32.309 --> 07:34.610
MARCH:
<i>This is my problem</i>

07:34.612 --> 07:36.011
with police officers.

07:36.013 --> 07:38.046
<i>All you care about is evidence.</i>

07:38.048 --> 07:40.215
<i>Evidence, evidence, evidence.</i>

07:40.217 --> 07:41.617
(distorted, echoing scream)

07:41.619 --> 07:42.784
(gasps)
John, look at me.

07:42.786 --> 07:43.819
HAHN:
<i>You're saying someone's</i>

07:43.821 --> 07:45.354
<i>picked up where this...</i>

07:45.356 --> 07:46.855
<i>this March guy left off?</i>

07:46.857 --> 07:49.625
JOHN:
<i>I don't remember anything.</i>

07:49.627 --> 07:51.827
Anything at all.

07:51.829 --> 07:54.162
MARCH:<i> You have made yourself</i>
<i>blind to everything</i>

07:54.164 --> 07:56.031
but what your eyes can see.

07:56.033 --> 07:57.399
SALLY:
<i>You remember everything.</i>

07:57.401 --> 07:58.634
It's not true!
John.

07:58.636 --> 08:01.169
Everything you did.

08:01.171 --> 08:04.039
<i>And it's gonna happen again.</i>

08:04.041 --> 08:06.208
<i>And again and again.</i>

08:06.210 --> 08:08.210
Wren.

08:08.212 --> 08:10.212
You can't stop it.

08:10.214 --> 08:12.414
No! It's not true!

08:12.416 --> 08:14.516
It's not possible.

08:14.518 --> 08:17.019
<i>It's not possible. </i>
MARCH:<i> You've lived in my hotel</i>

08:17.021 --> 08:20.656
<i>long enough to know that</i>
<i>what is impossible becomes...</i>

08:20.658 --> 08:23.425
<i>very possible</i> here.

08:24.929 --> 08:26.662
(crying)

08:26.664 --> 08:28.764
(panting)

08:28.766 --> 08:31.300
It's you, John.

08:32.202 --> 08:34.269
It's always been you.

08:36.674 --> 08:40.142
¶ ¶

09:09.406 --> 09:13.108
¶ ¶

09:45.576 --> 09:47.576
HAHN: Any sign of him?
WOMAN: No.

09:47.578 --> 09:50.846
He disappeared
in all the commotion.

09:50.848 --> 09:53.815
Send someone out
to his house.

09:53.817 --> 09:56.284
Make sure
his wife and kid are okay.

09:56.286 --> 09:58.353
Thank you.

10:05.129 --> 10:07.729
¶ ¶

10:17.841 --> 10:20.442
Nice of you
to look after my family.

10:20.444 --> 10:21.677
Jesus.

10:21.679 --> 10:23.078
John.

10:26.150 --> 10:28.984
You look terrible.

10:28.986 --> 10:31.486
I've come to confess.

10:31.488 --> 10:33.455
To helping this
one escape?

10:33.457 --> 10:35.791
Assaulting a guard?

10:38.128 --> 10:40.195
We can make it go away.

10:40.197 --> 10:42.130
And what about murder?

10:42.132 --> 10:44.132
Multiple murders?

10:44.134 --> 10:46.568
Ten Commandment killings?

10:46.570 --> 10:48.503
Can you make those go away?

10:48.505 --> 10:49.538
John, what are you saying?

10:49.540 --> 10:52.040
Please!

10:52.042 --> 10:53.542
You think I've lost my mind?

10:53.544 --> 10:54.810
I'm here for you.

10:54.812 --> 10:57.646
Talk and I'll listen.

10:57.648 --> 11:00.615
I remember
where it all began now.

11:01.585 --> 11:03.585
(exhales)

11:03.587 --> 11:05.353
It all started

11:05.355 --> 11:08.824
those first few days and nights
at the Hotel Cortez.

11:08.826 --> 11:11.159
The first time you
walked into that place

11:11.161 --> 11:12.828
was three weeks ago.

11:12.830 --> 11:15.597
These murders began
months before that, John.

11:15.599 --> 11:19.835
The first time I walked into the
Hotel Cortez was five years ago.

11:19.837 --> 11:22.437
I know that now.

11:22.439 --> 11:24.206
It was the same night we caught

11:24.208 --> 11:26.041
that multiple deaths call
in Glassell Park.

11:26.043 --> 11:27.442
<i>The dead family.</i>

11:27.444 --> 11:30.746
<i>Gunshot and asphyxiation.</i>

11:30.748 --> 11:35.083
<i>I needed a few drinks before I</i>
<i>could bring myself to go home.</i>

11:35.085 --> 11:37.919
<i>More than a few.</i>

11:37.921 --> 11:40.222
<i>It's not as easy</i>
<i>as you would think</i>

11:40.224 --> 11:43.425
<i>to find a drink in the middle</i>
<i>of the night in Los Angeles.</i>

11:46.463 --> 11:48.530
(Sally coughing)

11:56.573 --> 11:58.807
You sure
you're in the right place,

11:58.809 --> 12:00.242
cowboy?

12:00.244 --> 12:02.210
¶ ¶

12:02.212 --> 12:03.812
I heard this is where

12:03.814 --> 12:05.914
a man could find
the best martini in town.

12:05.916 --> 12:07.783
(gasps) Well, then,

12:07.785 --> 12:10.485
I guess you<i> are </i>
in the right place.

12:13.223 --> 12:15.490
(clears throat)

12:32.776 --> 12:34.843
Another.
Oh.

12:41.485 --> 12:43.952
Can I buy you your next one?

12:43.954 --> 12:46.087
I pay for my own drinks.

12:46.089 --> 12:49.658
It's cheaper than whatever
it is you want from me.

12:49.660 --> 12:52.027
Just trying to be friendly.
(chuckles)

12:53.363 --> 12:56.431
Do I look like
I need a friend right now?

12:56.433 --> 12:58.500
Well, yeah.

13:02.840 --> 13:06.007
You want to go to
a party upstairs?

13:07.511 --> 13:10.879
Liz's martinis
are awfully expensive.

13:10.881 --> 13:12.647
But they're worth every penny.

13:12.649 --> 13:14.983
I'm not looking
for a party tonight.

13:14.985 --> 13:18.486
I'm just looking to
drink myself blind and forget.

13:18.488 --> 13:20.155
And I'm married.

13:20.157 --> 13:22.891
It's not
that kind of party.

13:24.328 --> 13:27.295
Well, last call here
is in five minutes.

13:27.297 --> 13:30.031
If you really want
to get as blasted as

13:30.033 --> 13:32.868
you say you do, it's time to hit

13:32.870 --> 13:34.936
the after-party
upstairs.

13:36.139 --> 13:38.273
(instrumental jazz music
playing)

13:42.512 --> 13:44.946
MS. EVERS: You look
radiant tonight, madam.

13:48.385 --> 13:50.819
Though I have no idea
how one would launder

13:50.821 --> 13:54.456
something like that,
all those sparkly bits.

13:58.762 --> 14:01.162
How is the outside, darling?

14:01.164 --> 14:03.064
Tell me about one of

14:03.066 --> 14:04.165
your recent kills.

14:04.167 --> 14:05.700
All you ever want
to talk about

14:05.702 --> 14:08.436
are the kills. Pervert.

14:08.438 --> 14:10.705
(doorbell rings)
Damn it, who is
interrupting us?!

14:10.707 --> 14:12.607
I'll break the finger
who dared ring that bell!

14:17.114 --> 14:19.014
Yummy.

14:19.016 --> 14:20.148
(pats shoulder)

14:22.019 --> 14:24.953
What's wrong with you,
barging in on his night?

14:24.955 --> 14:28.490
Not that I mind,
but a deal is a deal.

14:30.427 --> 14:32.027
MARCH:
I get one night!

14:32.029 --> 14:34.629
One night with her
the whole month!

14:37.567 --> 14:39.634
Who is that with you?

14:41.538 --> 14:44.906
What is this,
a... costume party?

14:44.908 --> 14:47.042
This is John.

14:47.044 --> 14:50.211
He's a detective, and
he's had the kind of day

14:50.213 --> 14:53.381
that makes a man want to
drink himself to death.

14:53.383 --> 14:56.151
Really?

14:56.153 --> 14:58.253
Jimmy loves to hear
about the bad days.

14:58.255 --> 15:00.088
I'm The Countess.

15:00.090 --> 15:01.723
Countess of what?

15:01.725 --> 15:03.224
With those blue eyes,

15:03.226 --> 15:06.061
I'll be the countess
of whatever you like, baby.

15:06.063 --> 15:08.830
Tell me, John,
was someone killed?

15:08.832 --> 15:12.467
Did you have to
discharge your revolver?

15:12.469 --> 15:14.469
No.

15:14.471 --> 15:16.137
But people died.

15:16.139 --> 15:18.807
Five of them.
Children.

15:18.809 --> 15:22.978
And their father shot himself
in the head because of it.

15:22.980 --> 15:25.780
Brains are still
hanging off the ceiling.

15:25.782 --> 15:28.817
You speak about this
with such calm indifference,

15:28.819 --> 15:32.654
as if life and death
have no meaning to you.

15:32.656 --> 15:35.490
I'm a homicide detective.

15:35.492 --> 15:38.326
What I know is that death
is the only thing in life

15:38.328 --> 15:40.161
that has any meaning.

15:44.134 --> 15:47.102
I was promised
there'd be drinking up here.

15:47.104 --> 15:49.037
I'm thirsty.

15:49.039 --> 15:50.672
Leave us.

15:50.674 --> 15:53.708
I need to spend
some real time with this man.

15:53.710 --> 15:55.777
But, darling...

15:55.779 --> 15:57.812
it's our night.

15:57.814 --> 16:00.682
Yes, dear, and usually
I would hold that sacred,

16:00.684 --> 16:03.685
but there is something about
John that has drawn me in,

16:03.687 --> 16:07.522
and so, therefore, I release
you from your service.

16:16.867 --> 16:19.300
Good-bye, John.

16:21.571 --> 16:24.639
(door opens, closes)

16:28.678 --> 16:30.678
Absinthe.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.248
Yes, I know it's not
technically legal,

16:33.250 --> 16:36.017
but no need to play
Eliot Ness tonight.

16:36.019 --> 16:37.919
My name is
James March.

16:37.921 --> 16:40.221
I own this hotel.

16:40.223 --> 16:42.223
What is that accent?

16:42.225 --> 16:44.159
You sound like a 1930s movie.

16:44.161 --> 16:45.527
You look like one, too.

16:45.529 --> 16:48.430
Ah, yes.

16:48.432 --> 16:51.733
I had a marvelous professor
at Exeter.

16:51.735 --> 16:54.702
I freely admit that I
mimicked his Brahman diction

16:54.704 --> 16:56.738
until I made it my own.

16:56.740 --> 16:59.774
As for my clothing,
my choice of decor,

16:59.776 --> 17:02.110
the modern world is an
awfully uncomfortable place,

17:02.112 --> 17:03.945
don't you think?

17:03.947 --> 17:06.714
Yes, I know the accoutrements
of modern living allow an ease

17:06.716 --> 17:09.017
of communication, but the
price paid for that is

17:09.019 --> 17:12.087
that no one actually sits
and talks over a drink,

17:12.089 --> 17:14.422
like the good old days.

17:15.592 --> 17:17.792
Down the hatch.

17:23.033 --> 17:24.132
(sighs)

17:26.136 --> 17:28.036
Some time ago, we
had a guest here

17:28.038 --> 17:30.371
at the Cortez
named Kirlian.

17:30.373 --> 17:31.773
A photographer.

17:31.775 --> 17:33.575
He claimed to be able
to use electricity

17:33.577 --> 17:35.810
to photograph
a man's aura.

17:35.812 --> 17:38.480
I became fascinated
by these auras.

17:38.482 --> 17:40.315
Over time, I
began to be able

17:40.317 --> 17:42.617
to see a man's aura
the moment I met him.

17:42.619 --> 17:47.288
The moment you walked
into my suite,

17:47.290 --> 17:51.226
I was struck by the
intensity of your aura.

17:51.228 --> 17:53.928
See, most folks
radiate red or blue,

17:53.930 --> 17:55.830
purple if they're
quite mystical,

17:55.832 --> 18:00.602
but yours... was jet black.

18:00.604 --> 18:03.805
Black as the ace of spades,
as they say.

18:03.807 --> 18:05.507
What does that mean?

18:05.509 --> 18:07.075
Two schools of thought.

18:07.077 --> 18:09.644
One is that you have a
protective cloak around you.

18:09.646 --> 18:10.678
It allows you

18:10.680 --> 18:12.280
to focus on any task at hand,

18:12.282 --> 18:14.015
regardless of
the other's judgment.

18:14.017 --> 18:17.519
The other is that you
have a need to dominate

18:17.521 --> 18:19.454
and control the world
around you,

18:19.456 --> 18:21.256
bend it to your will.

18:21.258 --> 18:23.291
That is a man
who is willing

18:23.293 --> 18:25.260
to do bad to do good.

18:25.262 --> 18:27.629
You are full of shit.

18:27.631 --> 18:30.698
And you are
full of rage.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.667
Dangerous to keep it
all inside, John.

18:32.669 --> 18:35.503
It will give you the cancer if
you don't let it out sometimes.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.438
Tell me,

18:37.440 --> 18:38.940
have you ever roughed up
a suspect a bit?

18:38.942 --> 18:39.941
(chuckles)

18:39.943 --> 18:41.376
Put him in
handcuffs and then

18:41.378 --> 18:42.977
forgotten to read
him his rights,

18:42.979 --> 18:44.946
and then just given him
some good old-fashioned

18:44.948 --> 18:47.215
justice right
there on the spot?

18:47.217 --> 18:48.550
You think I don't want to?

18:48.552 --> 18:51.452
I feel your constant battle
to keep it in check.

18:51.454 --> 18:57.158
I once walked in on a 273D--
domestic dispute in progress.

18:57.160 --> 19:00.895
It took everything I had
not to...

19:00.897 --> 19:02.330
pound this guy's face,

19:02.332 --> 19:06.234
make him swallow
his own teeth and blood.

19:06.236 --> 19:08.970
Don't tell anyone
that though.

19:08.972 --> 19:10.872
Why not?

19:10.874 --> 19:13.575
Why should you
be ashamed?

19:13.577 --> 19:16.044
You would just be
doing your job.

19:16.046 --> 19:18.313
My job is to arrest them.

19:18.315 --> 19:20.481
And how does that make you feel?

19:20.483 --> 19:24.152
When you collar a man, as
opposed to letting your fists

19:24.154 --> 19:26.221
be jury and judge?

19:28.158 --> 19:29.857
If it was up to me?

19:29.859 --> 19:31.693
Yes.
I don't need a judge
to tell me

19:31.695 --> 19:33.695
whether someone's
guilty or not. I know.

19:33.697 --> 19:35.230
I believe you, John.

19:35.232 --> 19:38.032
If they took the leash off me,
crime would drop in this city.

19:38.034 --> 19:39.767
I truly do.

19:39.769 --> 19:42.370
JOHN:
<i>We drank his absinthe.</i>

19:42.372 --> 19:45.440
<i>We talked</i>
<i>for two straight days.</i>

19:45.442 --> 19:48.876
<i>We talked about the law--</i>
<i>man's law, God's law--</i>

19:48.878 --> 19:50.778
<i>and about the meaning</i>
<i>of true purpose</i>

19:50.780 --> 19:54.115
<i>and the meaningless</i>
<i>of everything else.</i>

19:54.117 --> 19:57.285
<i>Most importantly,</i>
<i>he helped me forget.</i>

19:57.287 --> 19:58.586
(door creaks)

19:58.588 --> 20:00.321
MARCH:
<i>He is the one.</i>

20:02.259 --> 20:04.826
COUNTESS:
I don't want him, not now.

20:06.763 --> 20:09.964
He's been poisoned
with that moonshine of yours.

20:09.966 --> 20:12.200
I didn't invite you here
to feed off of him,

20:12.202 --> 20:13.401
you perverted animal.

20:13.403 --> 20:15.103
I need your help.

20:15.105 --> 20:18.273
He... is the one.

20:21.044 --> 20:23.945
All the others I've tried
to mentor to finish my work--

20:23.947 --> 20:26.281
Gacy, Ramirez,
that poof Dahmer--

20:26.283 --> 20:27.882
all amateurs
compared to this one.

20:27.884 --> 20:29.484
He won't do it.

20:29.486 --> 20:31.719
Why? This man
has greatness in him.

20:31.721 --> 20:33.488
Once-in-a-generation rage.

20:33.490 --> 20:36.891
A man only has a grip as tight
as he does because he knows that

20:36.893 --> 20:38.393
if he lets go, even slightly,

20:38.395 --> 20:41.262
he will hurl himself
into the abyss.

20:41.264 --> 20:42.964
He won't let go.

20:44.434 --> 20:46.567
He still has hope.

20:46.569 --> 20:48.269
Easily remedied.

20:48.271 --> 20:50.471
He just needs a little shove.

20:50.473 --> 20:52.807
Why would I help you
when it gives me so much joy

20:52.809 --> 20:54.042
to see you suffer?

20:57.147 --> 20:59.147
He has children.

20:59.149 --> 21:02.650
The boy is very beautiful.

21:08.158 --> 21:10.591
Like I said,

21:10.593 --> 21:12.960
he just needs
a little push.

21:12.962 --> 21:15.029
A nudge into

21:15.031 --> 21:17.832
the darkest places
of his heart.

21:17.834 --> 21:19.934
He needs to hate
the whole world

21:19.936 --> 21:22.870
and everything in it.

21:32.048 --> 21:33.247
Mmm. (kisses)

21:41.358 --> 21:43.858
JOHN:
<i>I didn't remember--</i>

21:43.860 --> 21:47.295
<i>where, who with, what we did.</i>

21:47.297 --> 21:49.097
<i>It was lost time in my mind.</i>

21:59.676 --> 22:02.143
Scarlett carpooled with Wendy.
I'm late to take Holden.

22:02.145 --> 22:03.344
There's coffee though.

22:03.346 --> 22:04.645
I'm sorry, Alex.

22:04.647 --> 22:06.013
You should send
a bottle of Scotch

22:06.015 --> 22:07.148
to your friend Hahn.

22:07.150 --> 22:08.483
He tried covering for you,

22:08.485 --> 22:10.151
at least for the first
day and a half.

22:10.153 --> 22:12.053
I wasn't cheating on you.

22:12.055 --> 22:13.921
Of course you
weren't cheating.

22:13.923 --> 22:15.723
If you were, you
would have called

22:15.725 --> 22:18.226
and lied about
where you were.

22:18.228 --> 22:21.095
You're a
terrible husband.

22:21.097 --> 22:23.264
If we didn't have two kids
and I didn't still love you,

22:23.266 --> 22:26.067
I would tell you
to pack your bags.

22:26.069 --> 22:27.235
I'm sorry.

22:27.237 --> 22:30.004
It's just a slipup,
that's all.

22:32.075 --> 22:33.274
Hey, buddy.

22:33.276 --> 22:36.444
Hey.

22:36.446 --> 22:37.445
(grunts)

22:37.447 --> 22:39.080
Are you home
now, Daddy?

22:39.082 --> 22:40.915
JOHN:
Yeah, yeah.

22:40.917 --> 22:42.950
Hey, what do you say we all
go to the beach this afternoon?

22:42.952 --> 22:44.685
I drove by
and saw there's a big carnival

22:44.687 --> 22:47.622
or something going on
down there. Yeah?
Yay!

22:47.624 --> 22:49.690
All right,
we got to run.

22:49.692 --> 22:51.759
Come on.

22:54.464 --> 22:56.030
I love you guys.

22:56.032 --> 22:58.966
We love you, too.

22:58.968 --> 23:01.702
(door opens, closes)

23:11.714 --> 23:13.648
JOHN:<i> Along with my son,</i>
<i>I lost everything else</i>

23:13.650 --> 23:15.650
<i>that mattered to me.</i>

23:15.652 --> 23:19.220
<i>There was always something more</i>
<i>to do, until there wasn't.</i>

23:19.222 --> 23:23.124
<i>And after the volunteers</i>
<i>had gone,</i>

23:23.126 --> 23:25.626
<i>and the house was empty,</i>

23:25.628 --> 23:27.628
<i>I was never more alone</i>

23:27.630 --> 23:29.130
than being there

23:29.132 --> 23:30.998
<i>with my wife.</i>

23:31.000 --> 23:34.168
HAHN: You went through a
boatload of shit, John.

23:34.170 --> 23:36.404
Child went missing.

23:36.406 --> 23:37.805
But you got through it.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.273
You pulled yourself together.

23:39.275 --> 23:41.509
I was never the same again.

23:41.511 --> 23:43.411
<i>There was only one place</i>

23:43.413 --> 23:45.279
<i>I could feel</i>
<i>any measure of peace.</i>

23:45.281 --> 23:47.682
<i>A place where I could</i>
<i>lose myself</i>

23:47.684 --> 23:49.684
<i>and never be found.</i>

23:49.686 --> 23:52.954
<i>I began to live</i>
<i>two different lives,</i>

23:52.956 --> 23:55.289
<i>completely separate</i>
<i>from each other.</i>

23:55.291 --> 23:57.124
<i>One at home with Alex,</i>

23:57.126 --> 23:59.327
<i>where a minute lasted</i>
<i>every bit of 60 seconds.</i>

23:59.329 --> 24:01.095
(clock ticking loudly)

24:01.097 --> 24:02.830
<i>(knocking)</i>

24:02.832 --> 24:07.368
<i>The other at the Hotel Cortez</i>
<i>with James March.</i>

24:07.370 --> 24:09.370
(instrumental jazz music
playing)

24:09.372 --> 24:11.639
<i>Time had a way of making</i>

24:11.641 --> 24:14.408
<i>a different journey</i>
<i>in that place.</i>

24:19.549 --> 24:22.016
<i>Five years went by</i>
<i>like it was yesterday.</i>

24:23.453 --> 24:25.553
Foie gras.
Oh.

24:25.555 --> 24:29.056
It's surprising how delicious
a little cruelty can taste.

24:29.058 --> 24:31.492
Enjoy.

24:31.494 --> 24:34.228
JOHN:<i> His voice was like</i>
<i>a sliver of silk thread,</i>

24:34.230 --> 24:36.230
<i>a thin strand that would</i>
<i>wrap around my head</i>

24:36.232 --> 24:38.633
<i>before burrowing inside me</i>
<i>with his ideas.</i>

24:38.635 --> 24:40.635
John,

24:40.637 --> 24:43.371
do you know the difference
between you and I?

24:43.373 --> 24:45.139
Millions?

24:45.141 --> 24:47.341
No.

24:47.343 --> 24:49.410
Pain.

24:51.314 --> 24:52.880
I've shed my load.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.482
You carry yours like a man

24:54.484 --> 24:57.351
with a sack full of rocks
crossing a river.

24:57.353 --> 24:58.686
One false step

24:58.688 --> 25:00.488
and you go under.

25:00.490 --> 25:01.889
I submit
you've received

25:01.891 --> 25:03.891
no justice for the pain
you've suffered.

25:03.893 --> 25:06.894
You're constrained
by the very laws

25:06.896 --> 25:08.529
you promised to uphold.

25:08.531 --> 25:11.866
It's not your fault,
you see.

25:11.868 --> 25:15.036
It's what you've been taught.

25:15.038 --> 25:17.672
I've got 40 files
on my desk.

25:17.674 --> 25:20.541
Be lucky to clear ten of them.

25:20.543 --> 25:21.742
Real criminals

25:21.744 --> 25:24.579
never pay.

25:24.581 --> 25:26.647
Come with me.

25:28.618 --> 25:31.185
You're ready
for a new lesson.

25:31.187 --> 25:33.955
My trophy room.

25:33.957 --> 25:36.390
Why's it so
dark in here?

25:36.392 --> 25:39.060
Some things
you're not yet ready to see.

25:39.062 --> 25:41.462
Magnificent animals, all.

25:41.464 --> 25:45.199
The bison almost trampled me
in a stampede.

25:47.971 --> 25:50.304
Ah, yes.

25:51.641 --> 25:52.640
Jesus.

25:52.642 --> 25:54.609
MARCH:
My accountant, Henry.

25:54.611 --> 25:56.310
Henry was stealing from me,
to be sure,

25:56.312 --> 26:00.114
but he had so much more
to pay for.

26:00.116 --> 26:02.483
Halitosis, for one.

26:02.485 --> 26:04.118
You're a monster.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.953
I'm gonna
report this.

26:05.955 --> 26:08.289
You can report me,
but it won't take

26:08.291 --> 26:10.324
an ounce of weight
off those broad shoulders.

26:10.326 --> 26:13.961
What's holding you down is
a moral code contrived by man.

26:13.963 --> 26:16.797
Laws written by bureaucrats.

26:16.799 --> 26:20.901
Take my hand
and climb out of that morass.

26:23.339 --> 26:27.308
(door creaks open)

26:27.310 --> 26:31.145
JOHN:<i> Three people died</i>
<i>and they dismiss</i>

26:31.147 --> 26:33.114
because of a technicality.
The system, man.

26:33.116 --> 26:35.750
JOHN:<i> March was right. </i>
<i>(knocking)</i>

26:35.752 --> 26:37.752
<i>The law had nothing to do</i>
<i>with justice.</i>

26:37.754 --> 26:39.253
John!

26:39.255 --> 26:42.690
You're a sight
for sore eyes.

26:48.698 --> 26:50.665
(liquid pours)

26:50.667 --> 26:52.333
(light clattering)

26:52.335 --> 26:54.168
Why the glum face?

26:55.605 --> 26:59.507
A splash of brown plaid
will set you right.

27:10.186 --> 27:12.253
He would have
been ten today.

27:14.457 --> 27:17.391
My boy.

27:17.393 --> 27:20.661
So much potential
on the day of birth.

27:20.663 --> 27:24.465
Should be a cause
to celebrate.

27:24.467 --> 27:26.534
Not a day to mourn.

27:30.907 --> 27:32.773
Didn't work out
that way.

27:36.012 --> 27:38.646
Maybe it did.

27:38.648 --> 27:40.715
Not for Holden.

27:42.719 --> 27:45.086
For you.

27:49.759 --> 27:53.394
To be reborn.

27:53.396 --> 27:55.429
If I could find the man
who took him...

27:55.431 --> 27:58.365
You would bring him justice.

27:58.367 --> 28:00.501
There's no such thing
as justice anymore.

28:00.503 --> 28:03.571
All I see is how justice
is perverted every day.

28:06.843 --> 28:09.844
I want to share a story
about a guest

28:09.846 --> 28:12.613
who came to this hotel.

28:12.615 --> 28:14.548
<i>He brought his nephew</i>
<i>to stay overnight</i>

28:14.550 --> 28:17.785
<i>for a weekend of fun</i>
<i>at the theme parks.</i>

28:17.787 --> 28:20.788
<i>The boy bore</i>
<i>no familial resemblance,</i>

28:20.790 --> 28:23.457
<i>as far as I could see.</i>

28:23.459 --> 28:27.461
Ms. Evers found something while
she was changing the sheets.

28:31.601 --> 28:32.900
(sighs)

28:32.902 --> 28:34.902
Jesus.

28:34.904 --> 28:37.404
He's just a
little kid.

28:37.406 --> 28:39.974
Around ten, I would say.

28:42.278 --> 28:44.645
What room is he in?

28:44.647 --> 28:46.647
He checked out this morning.

28:46.649 --> 28:48.783
HAHN:
<i>You're confused, John.</i>

28:48.785 --> 28:51.085
I worked the Gamboa case
with you.

28:51.087 --> 28:52.887
He wasn't a pedophile.

28:52.889 --> 28:55.689
But that wasn't
Gamboa's only sin.

29:05.268 --> 29:06.767
I saw your ad on Craigslist.

29:06.769 --> 29:08.836
You have the money?

29:24.320 --> 29:26.353
There it is.

29:26.355 --> 29:29.089
The thing that
dreams are made of.

29:29.091 --> 29:32.526
The most important
award in the world.

29:32.528 --> 29:35.162
And you can have it
for $5,000 cash.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.932
Oh, it's heavier
than it looks.

29:37.934 --> 29:39.667
Y-You can

29:39.669 --> 29:41.302
smudge it all you want,

29:41.304 --> 29:42.703
after you hand
over the cash.

29:42.705 --> 29:44.939
Mm.

29:44.941 --> 29:46.640
Yeah.

29:46.642 --> 29:48.642
(light thump)

29:48.644 --> 29:50.945
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave

29:50.947 --> 29:53.814
and take those horrible
photographs with you.

29:53.816 --> 29:56.283
You checked into the Cortez
with this boy.

29:56.285 --> 29:57.952
Please.

29:57.954 --> 30:00.788
I'm just a man
who likes to write about movies

30:00.790 --> 30:01.956
on the Internet.

30:01.958 --> 30:03.791
Where is he now?

30:03.793 --> 30:05.826
Did you make him disappear?

30:05.828 --> 30:07.228
No.

30:07.230 --> 30:08.495
He's ten today.

30:08.497 --> 30:09.864
What are you talking about?

30:09.866 --> 30:11.832
You destroyed his family.

30:11.834 --> 30:14.969
Where's his justice?
Where's mine?

30:14.971 --> 30:18.405
What price are you gonna pay?

30:18.407 --> 30:21.308
I'm gonna call the cops.

30:21.310 --> 30:23.377
Beat you to it.

30:24.914 --> 30:26.814
(grunting)

30:29.719 --> 30:33.587
(growling)

30:35.391 --> 30:36.991
(exhales fiercely)

30:36.993 --> 30:39.927
<i>Holden!</i>

30:39.929 --> 30:43.230
<i>There's no such thing</i>
<i>as justice anymore.</i>

31:05.388 --> 31:07.087
(choking)

31:21.037 --> 31:22.202
It should have ended there.

31:22.204 --> 31:24.138
Somebody cut you down.

31:24.140 --> 31:26.573
JOHN:
<i>I've had help, Andy.</i>

31:26.575 --> 31:29.910
<i>And Sally--</i>
<i>she was always there,</i>

31:29.912 --> 31:32.313
<i>like a shadow </i>
(laughs)

31:32.315 --> 31:34.381
<i>dancing at the corner</i>
<i>of your eye.</i>

31:36.652 --> 31:40.254
<i>She wormed her way in.</i>

31:40.256 --> 31:42.323
<i>The way smoke</i>
<i>gets into your clothes.</i>

31:46.462 --> 31:49.063
<i>Before we lost Holden,</i>

31:49.065 --> 31:53.067
<i>the idea of cheating</i>
<i>on my wife, on my family,</i>

31:53.069 --> 31:55.269
<i>would have been</i>
<i>unthinkable to me.</i>

31:55.271 --> 31:57.271
<i>Then along came Sally--</i>

31:57.273 --> 31:59.773
<i>a bottomless pit of need. </i>
(panting)

31:59.775 --> 32:02.977
<i>When I was with Sally,</i>
<i>I was someone else.</i>

32:02.979 --> 32:04.445
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>where she came from.</i>

32:04.447 --> 32:06.447
<i>I didn't want to.</i>

32:06.449 --> 32:08.649
MAN (over TV):
Man lying with man...

32:08.651 --> 32:12.820
JOHN:<i> She accepted me</i>
<i>and I accepted her.</i>

32:12.822 --> 32:15.289
...through your generous
love offerings.

32:15.291 --> 32:16.790
SALLY:
Christ,

32:16.792 --> 32:18.659
how I hate this man.

32:18.661 --> 32:20.160
Hypocrite.

32:20.162 --> 32:21.328
Won't you pick up the phone...

32:21.330 --> 32:24.031
Spewing hate
and calling it love.

32:24.033 --> 32:26.533
...and call now.

32:32.341 --> 32:35.075
I have to go.

32:49.125 --> 32:51.291
No.

32:51.293 --> 32:53.360
I shouldn't be here.

32:54.897 --> 32:56.897
(door opens, closes)

32:56.899 --> 32:59.366
<i>She knew I'd always come back.</i>

32:59.368 --> 33:02.903
<i>And though I never</i>
<i>made any promises,</i>

33:02.905 --> 33:07.207
<i>I think a part of her</i>
<i>hoped that I would stay.</i>

33:08.711 --> 33:11.745
(grunting, gasping)

33:13.182 --> 33:14.681
What is the matter with you?!

33:14.683 --> 33:17.184
SALLY: I didn't do anything!
Precisely!

33:17.186 --> 33:19.353
You were just going
to let him expire?

33:19.355 --> 33:20.354
(coughs)

33:20.356 --> 33:22.923
He's not yours.
Not yet.

33:22.925 --> 33:24.825
Or have you forgotten
our little arrangement?

33:26.195 --> 33:28.095
My protection
comes with a price.

33:28.097 --> 33:29.396
This demon that you
and your kind have conjured

33:29.398 --> 33:31.765
with your diseased acts
must feed.

33:31.767 --> 33:33.600
If not on others, then on you,

33:33.602 --> 33:35.436
dear Sally.
Fine.

33:35.438 --> 33:38.439
I'll do whatever you say.

33:38.441 --> 33:40.607
I swear.

33:45.181 --> 33:46.647
(John panting)

33:48.084 --> 33:49.416
I'm afraid.

33:49.418 --> 33:51.218
What if he dies
out there

33:51.220 --> 33:54.088
and I lose him forever?

33:54.090 --> 33:55.456
You're a clever girl, Sally.

33:56.892 --> 33:59.326
Find someone who can
move in his world.

34:01.230 --> 34:04.364
HAHN:<i> This accomplice of yours,</i>
<i>this Sally,</i>

34:04.366 --> 34:08.035
she look anything
like this?

34:08.037 --> 34:10.104
Yeah.

34:10.106 --> 34:12.239
That's her.
Sally McKenna.

34:12.241 --> 34:15.609
She jumped out of a window
at the Cortez in '94.

34:15.611 --> 34:17.244
She's been dead for
more than 20 years, John.

34:17.246 --> 34:19.279
(screaming)

34:21.150 --> 34:23.917
John, can't you see
what's going on here?

34:23.919 --> 34:25.119
Man, you're confused!

34:25.121 --> 34:27.187
I'm not confused.

34:29.992 --> 34:32.659
Something's not real.

34:37.066 --> 34:40.400
When I leave this place...

34:40.402 --> 34:43.770
I can't remember you.

34:43.772 --> 34:45.973
Why can't I remember?

34:45.975 --> 34:48.942
The Cortez is a
selfish mistress, John.

34:48.944 --> 34:50.911
Jealous.

34:50.913 --> 34:54.248
Possessive.

34:54.250 --> 34:57.184
She will never let you
take anything with you.

34:59.121 --> 35:01.188
Come on.

35:02.525 --> 35:04.558
Come on.

35:18.674 --> 35:21.208
I killed a man tonight.

35:21.210 --> 35:24.211
And how did it feel?

35:24.213 --> 35:27.181
Like justice.

35:27.183 --> 35:29.349
Like I was punishing the
man who stole my boy.

35:29.351 --> 35:31.318
But you tried
to kill yourself.

35:31.320 --> 35:33.187
Because I loved it.

35:33.189 --> 35:35.389
I loved it more than anything
I've ever experienced

35:35.391 --> 35:36.523
in my life.

35:37.493 --> 35:39.960
Of course you did.

35:39.962 --> 35:41.662
<i>And why not?</i>

35:41.664 --> 35:44.398
You're discovering
who you really are.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.266
Your true purpose.

35:48.237 --> 35:51.205
Everything's chaos.

35:51.207 --> 35:56.310
It's up to us as civilized men
to impose order on that chaos.

35:56.312 --> 35:59.546
Just as you did tonight.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.515
I lost control.

36:01.517 --> 36:03.984
You let go.

36:03.986 --> 36:06.053
That's very different.

36:07.990 --> 36:10.090
It didn't bring Holden back.

36:10.092 --> 36:11.558
No.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.093
Your son is gone.

36:13.095 --> 36:14.695
And the pain
you're feeling

36:14.697 --> 36:17.731
will never go away.

36:17.733 --> 36:20.100
But you used it
tonight.

36:20.102 --> 36:23.604
You took your pain, and you made
the world a cleaner place.

36:23.606 --> 36:26.573
That's a decidedly positive
first step.

36:26.575 --> 36:30.210
I'd like to show you
something.

36:30.212 --> 36:32.679
(door creaks)

36:32.681 --> 36:34.248
Behold.

36:34.250 --> 36:36.950
The unfinished work of
James Patrick March.

36:36.952 --> 36:40.854
This was to be my crowning
achievement, my<i> Hamlet.</i>

36:40.856 --> 36:43.123
Well, really more of a sonnet
when you compare it

36:43.125 --> 36:44.925
to my earlier work.

36:44.927 --> 36:46.260
What I really loved
about this project

36:46.262 --> 36:47.761
was its simplicity
of statement.

36:47.763 --> 36:50.297
The elegance of
a round number-- ten.

36:50.299 --> 36:52.866
Which makes it even
more vexing I was never

36:52.868 --> 36:54.935
able to complete it.

36:57.373 --> 37:00.874
Finish my work, John.

37:00.876 --> 37:03.777
Make it your own.

37:03.779 --> 37:05.712
I'll get caught.

37:05.714 --> 37:07.914
No, no, no, no, no.

37:07.916 --> 37:09.916
You won't get caught.

37:09.918 --> 37:11.985
Because you're
going to make yourself

37:11.987 --> 37:14.154
lead detective on the case.

37:14.156 --> 37:19.159
Do it in loving memory
of your only begotten son.

37:35.344 --> 37:36.977
(camera clicking)

37:39.481 --> 37:41.014
So you want me to
believe that wasn't

37:41.016 --> 37:42.416
your first time at
the crime scene?

37:42.418 --> 37:43.984
My third.

37:43.986 --> 37:45.919
When I killed him,
when I went back there

37:45.921 --> 37:49.323
to remove the evidence,
and when you met me there.

37:49.325 --> 37:52.159
John. Uh...

37:52.161 --> 37:55.929
I thought Alvarez
caught this stiff.

37:55.931 --> 37:57.864
The hell we doing here?

37:57.866 --> 37:59.966
It interests me.
You really think

37:59.968 --> 38:02.469
taking on an extra case
is such a good idea?

38:02.471 --> 38:03.804
(camera clicking)

38:03.806 --> 38:05.439
Mm.

38:05.441 --> 38:08.642
Frankly, pal, you haven't
really been 100% lately.

38:08.644 --> 38:10.377
I'm fine.

38:10.379 --> 38:13.447
That's not what
your wife thinks.

38:13.449 --> 38:17.117
She called me
the other day.

38:17.119 --> 38:21.054
Wanted to see if we
could meet for coffee.

38:21.056 --> 38:23.857
You had coffee
with my wife?

38:23.859 --> 38:26.193
HAHN:<i> She's worried</i>
<i>about you, brother.</i>

38:26.195 --> 38:29.096
<i>Says you disappear</i>
<i>for days at a time.</i>

38:33.302 --> 38:36.136
You had coffee with my wife?

38:36.138 --> 38:38.338
(Sally moaning)
JOHN:<i> I know</i>
<i>they're banging each other.</i>

38:38.340 --> 38:42.142
She pushes me away.
Turns to my partner for comfort?

38:42.144 --> 38:44.144
(moaning)

38:44.146 --> 38:45.746
(panting)

38:51.887 --> 38:54.821
I'll kill them both.

38:54.823 --> 38:56.990
March wants me to
finish his work?

38:56.992 --> 38:58.258
I'll start with them.

38:58.260 --> 39:00.861
Mmm. (chuckles)

39:00.863 --> 39:05.165
You cannot begin
by killing your own wife.

39:05.167 --> 39:09.536
It has to be someone
they can't trace back to you.

39:09.538 --> 39:11.004
Oh.

39:11.006 --> 39:13.540
SALLY:
<i>They meet once a week.</i>

39:13.542 --> 39:14.908
(elevator bell dings)

39:14.910 --> 39:17.944
Every Thursday afternoon,
like clockwork.

39:17.946 --> 39:19.946
They're both married
with kids.

39:19.948 --> 39:22.182
They met on Ashley Madison.

39:22.184 --> 39:25.085
She puts the room
on her company credit card.

39:27.022 --> 39:30.023
Thou shalt not
commit adultery.

39:36.398 --> 39:38.698
They're in 53.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.634
<i>They like to do it</i>
<i>in the shower.</i>

39:40.636 --> 39:41.902
(water running)

39:41.904 --> 39:43.603
(moaning)

39:45.741 --> 39:47.741
The Emery murder didn't happen
at the Cortez.

39:47.743 --> 39:50.644
No. It couldn't happen there.

39:50.646 --> 39:52.879
Every act must be
dramatic, theatrical.

39:52.881 --> 39:55.215
<i>You must give it meaning.</i>

39:55.217 --> 39:56.616
<i>But never here.</i>

39:56.618 --> 39:57.784
Never at the Cortez.

39:59.888 --> 40:02.389
HAHN:<i> Both victims had the same</i>
<i>text on their cell phone,</i>

40:02.391 --> 40:04.658
each asking the other to
meet them at the Bel Air.

40:04.660 --> 40:06.426
<i>Only, they didn't send them</i>
<i>to each other.</i>

40:06.428 --> 40:08.562
JOHN:
<i>Then I got their family photos</i>

40:08.564 --> 40:10.430
from the Internet--
social media sites.

40:10.432 --> 40:12.833
HAHN:<i> I don't believe you. </i>
<i>And then I waited for them.</i>

40:19.341 --> 40:20.924
(door closes)

40:20.925 --> 40:22.508
<i>You remember that big pharma</i>
<i>bust we had a few months back?</i>

40:22.511 --> 40:24.778
<i>I got the male potency drugs</i>
<i>from our evidence lockup.</i>

40:24.780 --> 40:26.346
<i>You can check.</i>

40:26.348 --> 40:30.116
<i>And then I took his tongue</i>

40:30.118 --> 40:32.686
<i>and his eyes. </i>

40:32.688 --> 40:34.421
We already know
that's how it happened.

40:34.423 --> 40:36.156
If you really did it,
tell me something new.

40:36.158 --> 40:37.491
And what about
that suspect

40:37.493 --> 40:40.460
you reported seeing
at the Rylance house?

40:40.462 --> 40:42.429
<i>The man with the bowler hat.</i>
<i>You can't be</i>

40:42.431 --> 40:43.663
<i>in two places at once, John.</i>

40:43.665 --> 40:47.100
JOHN:
<i>It was me.</i>

40:47.102 --> 40:50.136
I was seeing myself manifested
as James March.

40:50.138 --> 40:52.772
Except you couldn't remember
any of this until today.

41:04.853 --> 41:08.088
Listen to me, John.

41:10.792 --> 41:13.627
Look, I know how bad
you wanted this guy.

41:13.629 --> 41:15.695
And you feel responsible.

41:15.697 --> 41:17.631
But you're not.

41:17.633 --> 41:20.033
I know you, brother.

41:20.035 --> 41:23.904
Now, you are a lot of things,
but you are no killer.

41:25.240 --> 41:26.907
(grunts)

41:26.909 --> 41:28.241
You're wrong.

41:28.243 --> 41:30.610
Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife, Andy.

41:32.381 --> 41:34.648
It's one of
the Ten Commandments.

41:38.186 --> 41:40.587
Admit what you've done,
and I'll show you some mercy.

41:41.490 --> 41:43.557
You don't deserve Alex.

41:44.493 --> 41:46.126
(grunts)

42:08.417 --> 42:11.851
To what do we owe this pleasure,
Mr. Police Officer?

42:14.423 --> 42:16.256
Is it that obvious?

42:16.258 --> 42:18.792
You must have
a lot of run-ins

42:18.794 --> 42:20.560
with the police.

42:20.562 --> 42:23.229
Checking in?

42:23.231 --> 42:26.232
I know who I am, Iris.

42:26.234 --> 42:28.468
And I know
who you are.

42:28.470 --> 42:31.638
I've been coming to this hotel
for the past five years.

42:31.640 --> 42:33.940
But now you remember.

42:35.978 --> 42:38.111
Oh, thank Jesus.

42:38.113 --> 42:40.580
Oh, it was exhausting.

42:40.582 --> 42:42.115
Every time I saw you,

42:42.117 --> 42:43.917
I didn't know which
John I was talking to.

42:43.919 --> 42:46.286
Some nights,

42:46.288 --> 42:49.723
I'd be so tempted
to set you straight, but...

42:49.725 --> 42:51.658
then I'd look into your eyes,

42:51.660 --> 42:54.294
see the pain.

42:54.296 --> 42:57.931
Didn't feel right
for me to add to it.

42:57.933 --> 42:59.633
I wasn't ready.

42:59.635 --> 43:00.834
Are we ever ready

43:00.836 --> 43:03.670
to see ourselves
for what we are?

43:04.640 --> 43:06.473
Yeah.

43:06.475 --> 43:09.976
Sounds like you have no regrets.

43:09.978 --> 43:11.945
None.

43:11.947 --> 43:13.813
Except for Wren.

43:13.815 --> 43:15.348
That one isn't on you, John.

43:15.350 --> 43:17.917
Wren died
because of Sally.

43:17.919 --> 43:20.320
Follow him wherever he goes.

43:20.322 --> 43:22.756
And do whatever
you have to do.

43:22.758 --> 43:25.925
Just don't let my man die
out there.

43:25.927 --> 43:29.763
What manner of shit are you
trying to put in her head?

43:29.765 --> 43:31.865
Language.

43:31.867 --> 43:34.134
Wren was trying to protect me.

43:34.136 --> 43:38.038
I guess, in some twisted way,
we all were.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.774
You know the truth.

43:40.776 --> 43:42.609
Walk out of here.

43:42.611 --> 43:44.210
Leave all this behind.

43:44.212 --> 43:47.213
You can do that.

43:48.784 --> 43:52.118
Give me the key to Room 64.

43:59.461 --> 44:01.494
Thou shalt not covet.

44:01.496 --> 44:03.697
The instrument
of adultery.

44:03.699 --> 44:06.433
I'd say you took
the best part of him.

44:09.171 --> 44:11.971
There's something different
about you, John.

44:11.973 --> 44:14.641
What is it?

44:16.645 --> 44:18.078
Clarity.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.080
(chuckles softly)

44:20.082 --> 44:22.148
Yes!

44:22.150 --> 44:26.152
You can finally appreciate
the beauty of your work.

44:26.154 --> 44:29.022
Death is your art.

44:29.024 --> 44:32.158
I stand in awe
of your talent.

44:34.863 --> 44:39.365
But what will you do with it,
now that you understand?

44:39.367 --> 44:42.068
Two more.

44:42.070 --> 44:44.871
Splendid.

44:44.873 --> 44:47.307
Then the masterpiece
will be complete.

44:49.244 --> 44:51.111
You're home, John.

44:53.081 --> 44:54.914
(laughs)
