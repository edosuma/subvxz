04:02.843 --> 04:03.875
Good.

04:09.616 --> 04:11.350
How are you?
Did I ask that already?

04:11.352 --> 04:12.751
-You did, but I am happy to...
-Okay.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.152

04:28.502 --> 04:30.168
-It's elissa.
-Yeah.

04:31.471 --> 04:37.209
Getting... cooking...
Just some...

04:37.211 --> 04:40.379
Grated ginger
and capers and...

04:41.881 --> 04:42.914
Ice cream.

04:49.522 --> 04:52.424
I didn't brush my teeth.

04:52.426 --> 04:55.394
That's why I'm licking my teeth
a lot right now, I don't know.

04:57.764 --> 04:59.498
So, anyway, I don't want
to hold you...

04:59.500 --> 05:00.999
Obviously if you have...

05:02.068 --> 05:03.101

Cool.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.638
Yeah. Okay.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.040
-All right.
-Yeah.

05:26.359 --> 05:26.992
Fuck.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.763
Here's your change.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.401
This is my car. Yeah.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.303
That's...

06:11.305 --> 06:13.004
-Too weird.
-Weird.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.713
Hey, do you want
to get a coffee?

06:24.517 --> 06:25.484
Maybe?

06:29.088 --> 06:30.021
Sure.

06:33.292 --> 06:34.226
-Yes.
-Great.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.342
Yeah, good.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.879
It's good.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.048
Good, yeah.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.034
I heard about your mom.

07:17.837 --> 07:19.404
I was really
sorry to hear it.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.605
Oh yeah, thanks.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.908
You know, she...

07:22.910 --> 07:26.711
She was sick for a little bit,
so it was, you know, we were
prepared for it

07:26.713 --> 07:28.213
-but thanks, you know.
-Yeah.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.715
But...

07:30.717 --> 07:33.852
We've been clearing out
her house a little bit

07:33.854 --> 07:35.754
and I think would
have fix it up and...

07:35.756 --> 07:37.255
Maybe sell it, so...

07:37.257 --> 07:38.089
Fix it up yourself?

07:38.091 --> 07:40.225
Yeah. That's kind
of what I do.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.529
Work on houses and stuff.

07:45.531 --> 07:46.965
-Wow.
-Yeah.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.668
You build them?
You do all the...

07:49.670 --> 07:53.171
I do... I mostly
do the dry wall stuff.

07:54.874 --> 07:58.677
Uncle John runs the business,
so I got caught up with him,
like...

07:58.679 --> 08:00.045
You know, we did
a bunch of work.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.547
In New Orleans
after Katrina and then...

08:02.549 --> 08:03.682
It's boring as shit but...

08:03.684 --> 08:05.116
It's not boring.
It's not boring.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.952
I didn't know that's what
you were doing.

08:06.954 --> 08:11.022
Yeah. It's good. It's steady
and it's consistent.

08:11.024 --> 08:14.192
And... yeah, it's cool.
It's fun.

08:17.897 --> 08:19.664
-What?
-What?

08:19.666 --> 08:21.333
I don't know.
You seem...

08:21.335 --> 08:22.200
Yeah, yeah.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.836

08:24.838 --> 08:27.706
I end up in tuscon
and it's great.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.875
Really nice, warm climate

08:29.877 --> 08:31.209
-It's too hot.
-No, it's good.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.879
It's better, you know,
it's not like here.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.212
So...

08:37.316 --> 08:39.317
That's... that's what
I've been doing.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.719
-Wow.
-Yeah.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.386
Tuscon. Warm.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.922
You know,
my parents moved.

08:44.323 --> 08:45.524
To Florida.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.093
To be warm.

08:48.594 --> 08:49.861
Yeah.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.663
They may move back.
They may have to move back.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.798
Yeah. What's going on?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.267
My sister's having a baby.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.203
Wow.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.340
Yeah. That's the grand
parent pressure.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.508
-Yeah.
-You know.

09:04.443 --> 09:05.911
You're not married, huh?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.846
No. Married to the work.

09:07.848 --> 09:08.947
Married to the dry wall?

09:08.949 --> 09:10.215
Married to the work.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.183
You know, I like it.
You know, it's good.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.452
It's really good for me.
I think that's how I...

09:14.454 --> 09:16.321
Yeah, it's good and...

09:18.024 --> 09:20.125
I think it's bright for me.
You know.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.366
You okay?

09:31.270 --> 09:32.304
Yeah.

09:32.306 --> 09:33.338
Okay.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.548
Trying to get through
this coffee.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.116
This coffee is terrible.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.719
The blue Jay has gone
down the hill.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.087
Yeah.

09:54.126 --> 09:55.026
What?

09:55.028 --> 09:56.328
Tell me about
your husband.

09:57.964 --> 09:59.331
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.201
Oh, god. I don't even know
where to start.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.773
I got really lucky.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.711
He's a really...
Incredibly supportive,

10:12.713 --> 10:15.080
very nurturing,
wonderful guy.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.247
His name is Chris.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.617
And when I met him,
he had two small boys.

10:19.518 --> 10:20.518
And so...

10:21.487 --> 10:25.357
Boom! Insta... insta mom.

10:25.359 --> 10:28.560
And his ex-wife was really
wonderful to me.

10:28.562 --> 10:32.897
Their whole childhood
we had a week with them
and a week off.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.833
And so, you know,

10:34.835 --> 10:37.502
one week, it's just
the two of us. We can do
whatever we want

10:37.504 --> 10:40.872
whenever we want to
and footloose and fancy
free and then next week

10:40.874 --> 10:43.108
it's little league
and soccer games

10:43.110 --> 10:44.943
and then studying
for their sat's

10:44.945 --> 10:47.712
and college tours
and you know...

10:48.147 --> 10:49.147
Yep.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.118
What?

10:53.719 --> 10:54.753
It's crazy.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.854
It's crazy. Yeah.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.589
It's just crazy.
It's great.

11:00.426 --> 11:01.826
Jim. What?

11:03.096 --> 11:04.896
It's crazy.
It's just crazy.

11:04.898 --> 11:05.997
Would you stop it?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.132
I am not
doing anything.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.733
You're doing something
with your face.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.468
I'm not
doing anything.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.905
My face leaks.
I don't know.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.173
But it's fine.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.710
It's fine. It's fine.

11:20.546 --> 11:21.713
-Good.
-Anyway.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.483
There's a pregnant woman
waiting for her ice cream.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.152
Oh, yes. God.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.653
I'll walk you back
to your car.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.255
-Okay.
-Yeah. Come on.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.947
Park dental
by the way, gone.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.582
Yeah.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.018
You had a couple
of cavities filled there.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.354
I think you had nine,
was that the record?

12:03.356 --> 12:04.889
Would have been
more like 11.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.324
Yeah.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.793
That's what happens when you
have love of jelly bean...

12:08.795 --> 12:09.761
Jim.

12:12.598 --> 12:13.832
There's no way.

12:13.834 --> 12:14.933
Oh, come on!

12:14.935 --> 12:16.835
No, that's not possible.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.002
I think it's him.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.471
No that's his grandson.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.806
He was like a hundred
in high school.

12:21.808 --> 12:23.041
That's his hat,

12:23.043 --> 12:24.809
-I'm telling you that's his hat.
-Oh, my god!

12:24.811 --> 12:26.778
Wayne travels
with wayney man.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.282
What?

12:31.284 --> 12:33.084
Do you think
he would remember?

12:34.386 --> 12:35.954
I'm not sure
he's alive.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.922
I haven't seen
him move yet.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.224
No he's not
going to remember.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.459
That was our dorky
thing that we did.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.994
That was...

12:42.996 --> 12:45.296
You want to put
a wager on it?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.799
I'll bet you $100,
he doesn't remember.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.033

13:27.774 --> 13:28.840
I don't have $100.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.894

16:37.130 --> 16:39.297
You're working?
You got a house,

16:39.299 --> 16:41.199
you're gonna build?

16:41.201 --> 16:43.901
I don't know,
Tucson is...

16:49.341 --> 16:52.610
And work stuff's
kinda up in the air.

16:52.612 --> 16:53.978
-What does that mean?
-So...

16:55.948 --> 16:57.181
Do you not
like doing it?

16:57.183 --> 16:59.851
No it's good, it's...

17:01.387 --> 17:02.987
I don't know.

17:02.989 --> 17:07.025
I have to admit there's a small
part of me as I was sitting...

17:07.027 --> 17:10.261
In the old house
and thinking about
fixing it up.

17:10.262 --> 17:11.996
And I'm starting
to think like...

17:13.565 --> 17:14.866
I don't know maybe...

17:16.201 --> 17:18.069
I could stay here.

17:18.070 --> 17:19.569
It looks
interesting to me.

17:20.506 --> 17:21.973
What would you
do here though?

17:23.108 --> 17:24.409
It's just a thought,
i don't...

17:24.411 --> 17:26.477
-I mean, I've no plan.
-I know, I like...

17:27.246 --> 17:28.512
Don't you want...

17:28.515 --> 17:29.647
Why you grilling me
right now?

17:29.649 --> 17:31.482
I'm not trying
to grill you, I just...

17:33.585 --> 17:36.087
I guess I'm a little
worried about you?

17:36.089 --> 17:37.288
Why are you worried
about me?

17:37.290 --> 17:39.457
I don't know, you don't...
You seem...

17:42.194 --> 17:44.328
I don't know a little,
lost or...

17:44.330 --> 17:47.465
I haven't got it all,
figured out.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.567
But... you know...

17:52.638 --> 17:54.105
Isn't there anything
you want to do?

17:54.107 --> 17:56.808
Amanda, I don't fucking
know what I'm doing, okay?

17:56.810 --> 17:59.577
I had lost my job, okay?
I lost my job.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.245
I had a falling out
with my uncle

18:01.247 --> 18:04.849
who was stealing clients
from me and I beat
the fuck out of him, okay?

18:05.818 --> 18:07.518
I beat the living shit
out of him.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.854
It was a really scary
moment and I had a crack

18:09.856 --> 18:12.056
and I feel awful
about it and I'm...

18:13.459 --> 18:15.660
I'm sorry,
i didn't... I...

18:16.795 --> 18:18.129
Oh!

18:18.131 --> 18:20.665
So I'm living in Tucson
and I don't want to stay
there anymore

18:20.667 --> 18:22.667
but I don't really
know where else to go.

18:23.569 --> 18:26.471
And it's...
I'm having a...

18:27.606 --> 18:30.074
Just having a hard time, so.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.509
I'm sorry, yeah.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.877
I'm not...

18:32.879 --> 18:34.378
I'm gonna start
crying again.

18:34.380 --> 18:37.548
-Yeah.
-This is a thing with me,
all right?

18:37.550 --> 18:39.417
I really think
it's your fault, honestly.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.818
Why is it my fault?

18:40.820 --> 18:43.020
You use to give me
the best head rubs.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.124
And they use to really
take the edge off.

18:50.395 --> 18:52.930
Quit hiding the jelly beans
hand 'em up.

18:52.932 --> 18:53.731
Come on.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.633
Give me some
jelly beans, okay?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.568
That's why I'm so sad

18:57.570 --> 18:59.837
'cause you won't
give me any jelly beans.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.443
It's also little hard 'cause
you're really impressive.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.145
Your life is really impressive.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.113
-Yeah...
-So there's a part
of me that's...

19:09.848 --> 19:11.115
Just saying.

19:11.117 --> 19:11.115
I don't know
on the way here

19:11.117 --> 19:15.153
I was getting on the plane
and there was this family

19:15.954 --> 19:18.723
and this little boy,

19:19.258 --> 19:21.959
he was so mad

19:22.794 --> 19:24.795
and just irate

19:24.797 --> 19:29.467
and of course he has no way
of expressing any of that
except sort of just like...

19:29.469 --> 19:32.970
Scream and stomp
his feet and...

19:32.972 --> 19:35.806
I mean, he was screaming
so loud that tongue
was curing to the back

19:35.808 --> 19:38.042
of his mouth and tears
were just like...

19:38.044 --> 19:40.878
You know, springing out
of his face he was...

19:41.980 --> 19:43.781
Leaking you know.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.317
And I just remember
looking at him and being
very jealous.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.186
You know,
that's my soul-mate.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.455
Me and that four year old.
That's my soul-mate.

19:51.457 --> 19:54.926
I don't know some point
we just learn it's better
not to do that and...

19:56.228 --> 19:57.762
I don't know
at what point...

19:58.964 --> 19:59.897
Here.

20:02.601 --> 20:03.868
You ate a lot of them.

20:03.870 --> 20:04.969
I did eat a lot.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.314
You left me all the pink
and purple ones

20:21.653 --> 20:24.155
yeah, they are
your favorites.

20:37.269 --> 20:38.669
What's up?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.972
Miss elissa wants to know
where's her ice-cream is at?

20:40.974 --> 20:41.939
Of course.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.375
Oh god!

20:44.377 --> 20:46.077
Does she like
ice-cream soup.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.714
I'm just telling her
i ran into some one.

20:51.583 --> 20:55.953
Don't take it person... sorry
yes. Okay fine I'll tell her
it's you just...

20:55.955 --> 20:57.688
-She'll ask me who.
-She's gonna ask...

20:57.690 --> 20:59.123
-There is is.
-Jim.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.925
Lisa, Lisa the interrogator.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.831
Holy fuckity fuck!
Jim, Jim?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.399
She's Lisa lising you.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.934
Yeah Jim Jim,

21:11.870 --> 21:13.037
yes.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.111
She wants to know
how you look.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.993
She wants to know, when I'm
coming back.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.979
I kinda want
to see your house.

21:56.181 --> 21:57.315
You want
to see the house?

22:12.164 --> 22:15.066
It's been really great
catching up with you.

22:16.902 --> 22:20.171
But if the reason you spending
time with me is because...

22:21.239 --> 22:22.807
You feel sorry for me.

22:24.142 --> 22:27.411
You don't have to do it,
it's okay. Okay?

23:28.340 --> 23:30.374
Sorry, just the boxes.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.543
Sorry.

23:32.545 --> 23:33.511
It's okay.

23:36.047 --> 23:37.114
Here we go.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.751
Yeah, still got
a lot of...

23:40.753 --> 23:41.986
Her stuff to pack up.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.020
Yeah

23:44.156 --> 23:45.456
that's a good one
in particular.

23:45.458 --> 23:46.457
Yeah, I'll say.

23:46.459 --> 23:46.457
Yeah.

23:48.660 --> 23:51.495
Yeah, pretty much
how she left it so...

23:51.497 --> 23:52.963
I've been thinking about...

23:53.932 --> 23:55.833
Dry walling where
the paneling is

23:55.835 --> 23:57.134
maybe take out
that wall,

23:57.136 --> 23:59.870
so that it opens
into the kitchen.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.139
I don't know there's also
something kind of...

24:02.707 --> 24:04.241
Cozy about the way it is.

24:06.478 --> 24:07.411
Thinking about it.

24:08.947 --> 24:12.516
Anyway, make yourself at home.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

24:12.518 --> 24:13.884
Will see you
in a sec.

25:42.307 --> 25:43.908
Oh, my god.

25:47.412 --> 25:50.981
This is a very serious
collection of romance novels.

25:52.484 --> 25:53.984
This could not
have been here...

25:53.986 --> 25:55.119
When we were
spending all that time

25:55.121 --> 25:56.387
I think there were some

25:56.389 --> 25:59.390
I think she really
started collecting

25:59.392 --> 26:02.359
-when I left
and I wasn't here to...
-Yeah...

26:02.361 --> 26:05.029
-We would have
a field day with it.
-Yeah.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.765
Well, I mean
let's face it,

26:07.767 --> 26:09.600
in your hay-day
you were pretty...

26:09.602 --> 26:10.834
In my hay-day?

26:10.836 --> 26:11.936
You were pretty romantic.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.004
I'm remembering...

26:14.006 --> 26:17.074
When you read <i> wuthering heights</i>
and you made me read it

26:17.076 --> 26:19.043
and you sent me that...

26:19.045 --> 26:21.445
I think it was four
legal page...

26:21.447 --> 26:23.480
-Jim, that's extreme...
-Letters about...

26:23.482 --> 26:24.782
You called me heathcliff

26:24.784 --> 26:26.383
and you called
your self Catherine.

26:26.385 --> 26:29.587
-I am you
and you are me.
-Please stop it!

26:29.589 --> 26:30.754
Yes so, by the way

26:30.756 --> 26:31.889
completely humiliating.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.324
Don't pretend you're
all above this.

26:33.326 --> 26:35.225
There's a very
big difference.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.928
I would like to point out
between this

26:37.930 --> 26:39.630
lovely array of books and

26:39.632 --> 26:42.700
the great work of art
and literature that
is <i> wuthering heights.</i>

26:42.702 --> 26:44.468
I mean they cannot
be compared.

26:45.971 --> 26:47.338
Here's something for you.

26:48.239 --> 26:49.940
"Right away.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.543
She knew that her heart
and soul belonged

26:52.545 --> 26:53.644
to Justin."

26:54.446 --> 26:56.580
What Justin?

27:00.018 --> 27:03.087
There's no sexier
name than Justin.

27:03.588 --> 27:05.422
"Oh, Justin!

27:05.424 --> 27:06.657
Do it to me Justin."

27:06.659 --> 27:07.858
-Oh, come on.
-Sorry.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.159
No, there's more.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.662
"But it wasn't until tonight
that she realized

27:11.664 --> 27:14.398
Justin also owned
her body."

27:14.400 --> 27:18.068
I'm sorry there's no
comparison between this
and <i> wuthering heights.</i>

27:18.070 --> 27:19.803
-It really, first of all...
-It's really

27:19.805 --> 27:21.138
sacrilegious thing...

27:21.140 --> 27:22.873
I don't want to think
about my mother reading it.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.009
You know what?
Neither do I, I have to say.

27:25.011 --> 27:26.343
I've been staring
at these books

27:26.345 --> 27:28.545
I'm trying to figure out
how to get rid of them

27:28.547 --> 27:29.513
why?

27:29.515 --> 27:30.414
Well, I don't know,

27:30.416 --> 27:32.249
it's weird like
i had this weird...

27:32.251 --> 27:35.953
I had a very strange mortality
moment when I looked
at them and I was like this

27:35.955 --> 27:37.388
eight hundred books here,

27:37.889 --> 27:40.057
and even if I...

27:40.059 --> 27:42.393
For some reason wanted
to read all of these books

27:42.395 --> 27:45.596
I wouldn't be able
to finish all of these
books before I died.

27:45.598 --> 27:49.533
That's a weird thing,
you know the math of that.

27:50.669 --> 27:51.769
Pretty morbid thought.

27:51.771 --> 27:52.870
No just...

27:52.872 --> 27:55.005
Not to be morbid
but just a thing.

27:56.775 --> 27:57.708
Well...

27:59.544 --> 28:02.479
You know it's all
relative, I think.

28:05.717 --> 28:07.351
I mean, my husband
you know...

28:09.154 --> 28:12.389
Maybe he would make
it through this, section.

28:14.659 --> 28:15.693
If you were lucky.

28:22.300 --> 28:23.500
-I don't know.
-Yeah.

28:26.905 --> 28:30.474
Can I... do you mind
if I go out side? I have
to make a phone call.

28:30.476 --> 28:31.642
Yeah, yeah of course.

28:34.446 --> 28:35.512
You know the way.

28:35.514 --> 28:36.580
Yes I do.

28:47.526 --> 28:51.328
I know, I'm sorry.
I meant to call you, yeah.

28:51.330 --> 28:55.365
The minute I got there she sent
me right out to get some food.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.534
Oh, yeah she
seems really...

28:58.103 --> 28:59.770
She seems really good.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.438
Yeah, she's just hungry.

29:05.009 --> 29:07.177
I think we're just
gonna stay in.

29:07.846 --> 29:09.313
Just you know...

29:09.981 --> 29:11.715
Watch a movie or...

29:11.717 --> 29:12.950
You know and eat.

29:15.487 --> 29:16.420
Yeah.

29:19.691 --> 29:23.227
Wait, can you just say
that again I didn't hear you.

29:24.496 --> 29:25.429
Yeah.

29:56.661 --> 29:57.594
This is amazing.

29:57.596 --> 30:00.197
This is amazing,
it's like a time capsule.

30:00.799 --> 30:01.765
It's all here.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.667
You needed
the black light...

30:03.669 --> 30:03.667
Black light...

30:03.669 --> 30:06.970
Hey it was 1993 you
needed a black light.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.272
Yeah I adore
the black light.

30:08.274 --> 30:09.606
You want to watch
some,<i> friends?</i>

30:09.608 --> 30:11.842
-Try outs?
-Try outs.

30:11.844 --> 30:15.512
The other option is I could
draw a little <i> gin blossoms.</i>

30:15.514 --> 30:16.613
Yes would you?

30:16.615 --> 30:17.714
Or...

30:18.283 --> 30:20.617
Maybe <i> tilda weds brocket?</i>

30:21.486 --> 30:22.920
I hate the sound
of tilda weds...

30:22.922 --> 30:24.321
Fine,<i> blues traveler.</i>

30:24.323 --> 30:25.756
I like <i> blues traveler.</i>

30:28.726 --> 30:32.529
Oh, well, well...

30:36.769 --> 30:40.337
You literally have every shirt
you wore in high school still.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.340
My mom kept stuff,
that's just...

30:44.676 --> 30:46.810
God, yeah.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.545
I remember
wearing this one.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.215
This one.

30:52.383 --> 30:53.917
I think this one is mine.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.387
Oh, I always
hated this one.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.755
I looked
good in that.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.991
You did not look good in it,
like a weird lumber Jack.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.693
You say that,
like it's a bad thing.

31:02.695 --> 31:03.794
It is a very
bad thing.

31:03.796 --> 31:04.895
Well, you know I'm sorry.

31:09.467 --> 31:11.101
-That's private property.
-Oh really?

31:11.103 --> 31:12.469
Have some respect, okay?

31:12.471 --> 31:14.838
For what? For your privacy?

31:14.840 --> 31:16.240
Yes, exactly.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.008
You probably read
these to me out loud.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.309
It's called privacy.

31:21.446 --> 31:23.180
No, no, that's private.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.249
Oh, my...

31:25.251 --> 31:28.719
"The winds of change
are fucking blowing tonight."

31:28.721 --> 31:31.822
-No. Don't read.
-No.

31:31.824 --> 31:33.190
-Don't read, no.
-"Amanda...

31:33.192 --> 31:34.558
Amanda.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.327
Who knew her name
was going to be Amanda.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.296
-What a face."
-Hey!

31:39.298 --> 31:40.564
"What a spirit.

31:40.566 --> 31:43.033
My lips said hello
my friend

31:43.035 --> 31:45.636
but my heart said
hello my future.

31:48.973 --> 31:51.341
I don't even know
myself anymore.

31:52.176 --> 31:54.344
Jim has been
ripped in half

31:54.346 --> 31:57.214
but I'm so happy
to bleed,

31:57.216 --> 31:58.682
for there is Amanda."

32:31.115 --> 32:32.849
Oh, my god!

32:33.952 --> 32:35.485
You want Japan
or New York?

32:35.954 --> 32:37.354
New York

32:40.191 --> 32:41.558
oh, my god!

32:43.762 --> 32:46.563
I found a picture of you
that is outrageous.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.842
You don't deserve
this by the way.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.410
Digging through my stuff.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.379
Listen man, you don't have
lock on your shit

33:02.381 --> 33:03.981
it's bound to get
broken into.

33:06.451 --> 33:08.952
Man, I can't believe
you still have all this stuff.

33:10.054 --> 33:11.388
Little crazy.

33:11.390 --> 33:12.956
Mom was a bit
of a hoarder.

33:13.257 --> 33:14.458
Yeah.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.035
Do you dare?

33:25.037 --> 33:26.370
Are you brave enough?

33:29.507 --> 33:32.009
"The winds of fucking change
are blowing tonight."

33:32.011 --> 33:33.577
Fuck you.

33:34.479 --> 33:37.814
"This first classic
performance is entitled

33:37.816 --> 33:40.417
hanging out, may 1994."

33:41.753 --> 33:42.719
Oh my god!

33:42.721 --> 33:45.355
I don't know whats
happening. Good luck.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.090
What's it gonna be?

33:47.859 --> 33:48.859
Oh boy!

33:54.098 --> 33:56.967
<i> She just don't understand</i>

33:56.969 --> 33:58.902
<i> oh, she jealous, she jealous</i>

33:58.904 --> 33:58.902
<i> she jealous.</i>

33:58.904 --> 34:02.506
<i> That's right folks</i>
<i> and mamma her mamma</i>

34:02.508 --> 34:03.774
<i> and mamma had a son</i>

34:03.776 --> 34:06.810
<i> -she just don't understand.</i>
-No way.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.413
<i> She's jealous,</i>
<i> she's jealous, she's jea...</i>

34:09.947 --> 34:12.114

34:13.619 --> 34:15.052
-i was recording over...
-God damn it.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.186
We were running
out of tape.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.822
- Wait hold on.
- -<i> Welcome home.</i>

34:18.824 --> 34:21.558
<i> Thanks sweetheart</i>
<i> so good to see you.</i>

34:25.496 --> 34:26.696
<i> How is work?</i>

34:26.697 --> 34:26.696
Ew.

34:26.697 --> 34:31.333
<i> You know</i>
<i> Glen donavon is canceling</i>
<i> his account with us.</i>

34:31.335 --> 34:32.702

<i> can you believe it?</i>

34:34.773 --> 34:35.539
Oh, business.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.440
23 years
with Glen donavon...

34:37.443 --> 34:38.574
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

34:38.577 --> 34:41.878
<i> I've got little</i>
<i> something to cheer you up.</i>

34:41.880 --> 34:44.147
I've got something
to cheer you...

34:44.149 --> 34:45.282
<i> Not that.</i>

34:45.284 --> 34:48.018
You are in a late night
cinemax movie.

34:49.187 --> 34:50.120
<i> Close your eyes.</i>

34:51.522 --> 34:54.658
<i> -Why?</i>
<i> -Just do it!</i>

34:55.525 --> 34:56.760
See I'm the boss,
even then.

34:56.762 --> 34:56.760
You're the boss.

34:56.762 --> 35:01.598
- <i> What are you doing?</i>
<i> Would you be patient?</i>

35:01.600 --> 35:04.034
<i> -I'm not patient.</i>
<i> -Jim, come on.</i>

35:04.502 --> 35:06.970
<i> Okay, open them.</i>

35:08.940 --> 35:10.006
<i> Oh, my god!</i>

35:10.008 --> 35:12.042

35:19.518 --> 35:23.487
<i> I'm so thankful, I didn't get</i>
<i> you anything. I'm sorry,</i>
<i> I forgot.</i>

35:23.489 --> 35:25.856
<i> It's okay, you've been busy</i>
<i> just sit down, let's eat.</i>

35:25.858 --> 35:27.224
<i> It's delicious, it's like...</i>

35:28.626 --> 35:31.094
<i> -Oh, my god!</i>
<i> -Is it good?</i>
<i> I made your favorite.</i>

35:32.230 --> 35:33.864
<i> You are my favorite.</i>

35:33.866 --> 35:35.866
<i> I better be your favorite.</i>

35:35.868 --> 35:38.268
<i> So did you talk</i>
<i> to Jessica yet today?</i>

35:38.270 --> 35:40.637
<i> -I did.</i>
<i> -And?</i>

35:40.639 --> 35:43.640
<i> And she got it.</i>

35:43.642 --> 35:45.075
<i> Yes, yes!</i>

35:45.077 --> 35:47.777
<i> Oh, I knew she would.</i>
<i> I mean two years in</i>

35:47.779 --> 35:50.547
<i> -she's already</i>
<i> getting promoted.</i>
<i> -But, are you surprised?</i>

35:50.549 --> 35:50.547
<i> No that's our Jessica.</i>

35:50.549 --> 35:55.051
<i> Ever since she</i>
<i> was three years old she</i>
<i> started telling me</i>

35:55.053 --> 35:57.487
<i> what to ware I think</i>
<i> we knew not to worry.</i>

35:57.922 --> 35:57.921
<i> I know.</i>

35:57.923 --> 36:02.292
<i> Now I know our poor</i>
<i> Jason was a little</i>

36:02.294 --> 36:04.561
<i> -yeah.</i>
<i> -Odd on the phone today.</i>

36:04.563 --> 36:07.764
<i> I think it's so hard</i>
<i>when your big sister</i>
<i>is so successful.</i>

36:07.766 --> 36:10.167
<i> Yeah must be,</i>
<i> but he's so wonderful</i>

36:10.169 --> 36:12.035
<i> in his own way.</i>

36:12.037 --> 36:14.471
<i> He's gonna find it,</i>
<i> I know he will.</i>

36:14.473 --> 36:16.439
<i> He's got your eyes.</i>

36:16.441 --> 36:17.741
<i> He's got your heart.</i>

36:20.579 --> 36:22.412
<i> We've got that great</i>
<i> couple of kids.</i>

36:22.414 --> 36:23.947
<i> Oh yeah, they got</i>
<i> a great mom.</i>

36:23.949 --> 36:27.784
<i> -Best mom in the whole world.</i>
<i> -Best dad in the whole world.</i>

36:29.220 --> 36:31.288
<i> It's kinda funny like...</i>

36:31.290 --> 36:34.724
<i> Having the house</i>
<i> to ourselves again, isn't it?</i>

36:34.726 --> 36:37.694
<i>All those years with the four</i>
<i>of us running around,</i>

36:37.696 --> 36:39.629
<i> bumping in to each other.</i>

36:40.531 --> 36:42.199
<i> It's back down</i>
<i> to the two of us.</i>

36:43.301 --> 36:44.234
<i> Yeah.</i>

36:45.736 --> 36:47.871
<i> -But it's nice.</i>
<i> -Yeah, it's nice.</i>

36:49.473 --> 36:51.541
<i> Hey, I'm really sorry</i>

36:51.543 --> 36:53.643
<i> I forgot to get an</i>
<i> anniversary present.</i>

36:53.645 --> 36:55.312
<i> It's okay.</i>

36:55.314 --> 36:58.615
<i> I feel really bad,</i>
<i>I'm gonna go</i>
<i>to the bathroom I'll be quick.</i>

37:10.328 --> 37:12.929
<i> Jim, what are you doing?</i>

37:12.931 --> 37:15.932
<i> Oh, just nothing.</i>
<i> Here open it, open it.</i>

37:15.934 --> 37:15.932
So stupid.

37:15.934 --> 37:19.269
<i> You got us tickets</i>
<i> to see Annie Lennox?</i>

37:19.271 --> 37:22.305
<i> Yes I did. Happy anniversary</i>
<i> to you late dancing.</i>

37:22.307 --> 37:24.908
<i> You're such a bitch,</i>
<i> you tricked me.</i>

37:24.910 --> 37:28.912
<i> Yeah I still got a few tricks</i>
<i> left in my old sleeve here.</i>

37:34.852 --> 37:37.020
<i> I love you Amanda Henderson.</i>

37:37.022 --> 37:38.054
<i> I love you more.</i>

37:38.056 --> 37:39.522
<i> You are so good!</i>

37:42.060 --> 37:43.893
<i> -You're still</i>
<i> like an old man.</i>
<i> -Surprise!</i>

37:43.895 --> 37:45.895
<i> You're still like an old man.</i>

37:45.897 --> 37:48.164
<i> I actually believe that</i>
<i> you could really cook.</i>

37:49.768 --> 37:51.835
<i> -Kiss me.</i>
<i> -Hey.</i>

37:51.837 --> 37:54.471
<i> -Here's to 80 more.</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

37:54.473 --> 37:55.772
<i> Hundred and twenty more.</i>

37:55.774 --> 37:57.607
<i> -Yeah we can do that, right?</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

38:11.155 --> 38:12.455
We weren't very cool.

38:12.457 --> 38:15.925
No, we were
deeply uncool.

38:16.394 --> 38:18.128
That was really...

38:18.829 --> 38:19.763
Yeah.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.701
I wonder where
that plane's going.

38:26.504 --> 38:27.637
It's not coming here.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.475
You'd think...
That town down there?

38:32.477 --> 38:33.943
-Suck!
-Suck!

38:33.945 --> 38:37.547
Although, you know what
it's the fact that it's dark.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.582
You can't quite see
the shithole-ness.

38:39.584 --> 38:41.184
That is right.

38:41.186 --> 38:42.319
And actually
right now...

38:42.321 --> 38:43.286
It does look
kinda pretty.

38:43.288 --> 38:44.287
It's kinds nice

38:44.289 --> 38:45.255
-right?
-Yeah.

38:47.591 --> 38:48.792
Not so bad.

38:58.235 --> 38:59.736
What's on your mind, eh?

39:03.240 --> 39:04.407
Is it that obvious?

39:08.079 --> 39:09.112
I was really...

39:10.681 --> 39:12.048
Little unnerving...

39:13.484 --> 39:16.853
Back there, listening
to all that stuff.

39:18.889 --> 39:23.693
I mean,
i seemed quite... fun.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.096
-First of all.
-Your rapping career

39:26.098 --> 39:30.233
didn't turn out the way
you hoped it would, I think.

39:30.235 --> 39:31.634
I understand.

39:38.309 --> 39:41.444
It's almost like I don't know
who that person was on the tape.

39:44.482 --> 39:46.850
I remember her
really well.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.219
She was really fun,
wasn't she?

39:49.221 --> 39:50.387
Yeah she's great.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.724
-Yeah.
-And I...

39:54.726 --> 39:57.060
Don't get me wrong
it's not that my...

39:58.596 --> 40:00.296
Life isn't that...

40:01.198 --> 40:02.132
I just...

40:05.102 --> 40:06.403
-Amanda?
-What?

40:07.505 --> 40:08.838
I understand.

40:12.176 --> 40:14.110
You don't have to explain
it to me.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.221
Would you like to have
some fun tonight?

40:27.124 --> 40:29.793
Like just some...

40:31.095 --> 40:34.831
Stupid ass... fun,
tonight.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.334
Well now I'm scared.
What you gonna do?

40:39.270 --> 40:40.336
Do you trust me?

40:40.338 --> 40:41.738
I don't know.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.373
-It's been a long time
i don't know.
-It's a big question.

40:43.375 --> 40:45.308
-Yeah, it's been
a long time.
-I really don't know.

40:47.011 --> 40:49.078
I say fuck
the ice-cream now.

40:51.315 --> 40:52.482
Fuck the ice-cream.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.218
Is that your new rap?

40:55.220 --> 40:57.253
-Fuck the ice-cream.
-Fuck the ice-cream.

40:57.255 --> 40:58.388
Fuck the...

40:58.390 --> 40:59.823
Fuck, fuck...

40:59.825 --> 41:00.890
Fuck the ice-cream.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.492
Fuck the ice-cream.

41:54.979 --> 41:56.479
Honey I'm home.

41:56.481 --> 41:57.914
Hi, sweetheart.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.482
You have to close
your eyes.

41:59.484 --> 42:00.783
Please just stay
right up there,

42:00.785 --> 42:03.152
do not come down here
and close your eyes.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.854
Why do I have
to close my eyes?

42:04.856 --> 42:06.556
What's going on?

42:06.558 --> 42:07.957
Because, it's a surprise.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.259
Please sweetheart.

42:09.727 --> 42:11.294
Surprise, okay.

42:11.296 --> 42:13.363
Did you have a good day,
Mr. Henderson?

42:13.365 --> 42:16.399
Well, there's a lot to talk
about. How was your day Mrs.
Henderson?

42:16.401 --> 42:20.303
I have something very exciting
to tell you as well.

42:20.305 --> 42:23.873
Wow, that sounds like we
should have dinner and talk
about our day.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.676
Do me a favor and please
be patient.

42:26.678 --> 42:29.212
Okay, I'm being patient,
I'm closing my eyes.

42:29.214 --> 42:30.980
Keep them closed.

42:30.982 --> 42:33.316
You know I'll do anything
for you Mrs. Henderson.

42:34.318 --> 42:35.451
I'm counting on it.

42:37.121 --> 42:39.222
Something smells delicious.

42:43.661 --> 42:44.794
Hello.

42:44.796 --> 42:46.129
Hello, Mrs. Henderson.

42:46.964 --> 42:49.098
Hello, Mr. Henderson.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.533
Keep your eyes closed
and come with me.

42:50.535 --> 42:51.534
Okay.

42:51.536 --> 42:52.735
-Come with me.
-Yes.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.203
Hold on to the railing please.

42:54.738 --> 42:56.539
-Okay.
-Okay.

42:57.875 --> 42:59.242
It's very exciting.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.110
-I love surprises.
-Tell me

43:01.112 --> 43:02.679
all about your day at work.

43:02.681 --> 43:03.980
Okay.

43:07.585 --> 43:10.353
On the count of three
i want you to open your eyes.

43:10.355 --> 43:11.287
Okay.

43:16.727 --> 43:18.528
Okay, go for it.

43:18.530 --> 43:19.696
One...

43:20.698 --> 43:21.998
Two...

43:23.133 --> 43:24.167
Three...

43:24.169 --> 43:27.303
Oh, my god!
Look at this meal!

43:27.305 --> 43:28.905
It's gorgeous.

43:28.907 --> 43:31.541
You made all this?
You cooked all this?

43:31.543 --> 43:34.077
Have you been taking
cooking classes on the sly?

43:34.079 --> 43:35.745
-Maybe, Mr. Henderson.
-Oh my gosh!

43:35.747 --> 43:40.049
Mrs. Henderson this meal
is beautiful, it's elegant...

43:40.051 --> 43:41.584
Very French, Mr. Henderson.

43:41.586 --> 43:43.686
But, I have a question.

43:43.688 --> 43:45.254
What's the special occasion?

43:45.256 --> 43:47.256
I can't believe
you forgot.

43:47.891 --> 43:49.959
-What?
-Mr. Henderson?

43:53.097 --> 43:54.530

43:54.532 --> 43:56.699
Happy 20th anniversary lover.

43:59.269 --> 44:02.205

44:02.207 --> 44:04.173
Happy anniversary sweetheart.

44:08.579 --> 44:09.746
There you are.

44:12.950 --> 44:14.584
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

44:15.819 --> 44:17.887
These eggs are really something.

44:17.889 --> 44:19.288
Really?

44:19.290 --> 44:21.157
And the noodles,
are they Asian?

44:21.959 --> 44:23.660
They're really fantastic.

44:23.662 --> 44:27.030
Yes that I slaved over
for a very long time they're
very hard to make.

44:27.032 --> 44:28.231
Very hard to make.

44:28.233 --> 44:30.199
You can really taste
it in there.

44:30.201 --> 44:32.301
How is your day,
sweetheart?

44:32.303 --> 44:35.605
Well, Glen Donovan
was added again honey.

44:35.607 --> 44:37.807
Glen Donovan, he's always
giving you such a hard time

44:37.809 --> 44:41.210
I don't know if I can take
another day with him I mean it's
good stable income

44:41.212 --> 44:43.346
until your career
takes off of course but...

44:43.348 --> 44:47.884
Well, it's very funny
that you should mention
that because I got a very

44:47.886 --> 44:49.218
exciting phone call today.

44:49.220 --> 44:51.721
You did? What was your
phone call?

44:51.723 --> 44:53.489
I got a call today,

44:55.159 --> 44:57.093
saying I got the opening slot.

44:58.228 --> 45:01.264
Opening... you got
the opening slot.

45:01.266 --> 45:05.168
I am going to open for...

45:05.936 --> 45:07.937
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

45:07.939 --> 45:09.739
Oh very seriously.

45:09.741 --> 45:12.608
Are you going to be the first
female white rapper
to open for public enemy?

45:12.610 --> 45:12.608
Booya!

45:12.610 --> 45:15.545
I knew it! I knew you
could do it honey.

45:15.547 --> 45:18.081
Mrs. Henderson
they loved your demo.

45:18.083 --> 45:20.817
They loved my demo.
They thought is was so fresh

45:20.819 --> 45:22.852
I'm so impressed
come here.

45:22.854 --> 45:24.620
Cheers to you
Mrs. Henderson.

45:24.622 --> 45:26.589
I can't believe it. Oh, no.

45:27.959 --> 45:30.593
But you'll be on tour and I'll
miss you and I'll be so sad.

45:30.595 --> 45:31.694
What do we do about that?

45:35.232 --> 45:37.133
What do you think
about saying...

45:37.601 --> 45:38.601
Fuck you!

45:39.002 --> 45:40.770
To Glen Donovan?

45:40.772 --> 45:44.674
I do it inside of my head
everyday darling, I'd love
to say it out loud.

45:44.676 --> 45:47.343
Tell me what you have?
Tell me.

45:47.345 --> 45:48.745
Okay, but you promise
not to laugh.

45:48.747 --> 45:50.346
I won't laugh.

45:50.348 --> 45:52.415
I would never laugh
at you honey.

45:52.417 --> 45:55.351
I think you could be really,
really romantic.

45:55.353 --> 45:57.320
And also an opportunity
to kinda like...

45:58.555 --> 46:01.524
Find ourselves
and be adventurous.

46:01.526 --> 46:02.725
We rent an rv...

46:02.727 --> 46:04.060
-Can I drive?
-You can drive.

46:04.062 --> 46:05.194
Can we get matching hats?

46:05.196 --> 46:06.496
We can get matching hats.

46:06.897 --> 46:08.331
Laminated maps.

46:08.333 --> 46:10.166
We'll go from town to town,

46:10.168 --> 46:13.903
exploring things
and sleeping outside...

46:13.905 --> 46:15.204
Rapping by night.

46:15.206 --> 46:16.305
Rapping by night.

46:16.307 --> 46:18.574
-Adventuring during the day.
-Yes.

46:18.576 --> 46:20.209
We're gonna go looking
for hot Springs.

46:20.211 --> 46:23.513
Hot Springs and zip lining
and weird food...

46:23.515 --> 46:25.348
-And we can go
all over the country.
-Diarrhea

46:25.350 --> 46:26.783
we'll see all our people.

46:26.785 --> 46:28.284
We'll see all our
favorite people.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.686
All our friends and people who
use to live here and moved away

46:30.688 --> 46:33.122
and Jessica and Jason
will come and visit us.

46:33.124 --> 46:35.291
It will be so magical.

46:37.494 --> 46:38.427
Don't you think?

46:41.665 --> 46:42.965
-Honey?
-What?

46:42.967 --> 46:45.234
If you don't want to do it,
we don't have to do it,

46:45.236 --> 46:47.436
I think it could
be really romantic.

46:48.705 --> 46:50.840
Now you listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

46:54.611 --> 46:58.214
This is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to us.

46:58.216 --> 46:59.649
-Honey.
-What?

46:59.651 --> 47:00.950
I got eggs on your beard.

47:00.952 --> 47:02.185
You got some eggs
on my beard?

47:02.187 --> 47:03.419
It's okay.

47:03.421 --> 47:05.421
It's okay, you know why?

47:06.089 --> 47:08.357
Honey that was really funny.

47:11.161 --> 47:13.262
But in all seriousness hon...

47:15.465 --> 47:17.200
You are...

47:17.202 --> 47:21.604
A brilliant planner,
you're a wonderful cook.

47:21.606 --> 47:23.472
-Sweetheart.
-You're the greatest...

47:24.174 --> 47:26.275
Rap artist I've ever known.

47:26.277 --> 47:28.277
It's the only true
thing you just said.

47:29.179 --> 47:32.915
And I think
it's time for me...

47:32.917 --> 47:35.618
To unveil my
anniversary surprise.

47:35.620 --> 47:36.752
You didn't.

47:38.522 --> 47:39.856
I did.

47:39.858 --> 47:40.957
You didn't.

47:43.093 --> 47:44.527
I did.

47:46.563 --> 47:47.563
You didn't.

47:51.735 --> 47:52.869
I did.

47:56.273 --> 47:58.708
Watch the one eyebrow raise,
watch this happen.

48:00.143 --> 48:01.711
You're not doing it honey.

48:02.946 --> 48:04.981
There it is. Nailed it.

48:04.983 --> 48:06.649
Not at all.

48:06.651 --> 48:08.484
-Yes too.
-You have to do this, no.

48:10.087 --> 48:11.387
Did I do it?

48:11.389 --> 48:15.024
Well, now it's...
Try again with something else.

48:15.026 --> 48:17.326
I'm really sorry
i got egg on you, honey.

48:17.328 --> 48:19.262
It's a very sweet thing
after all these years

48:19.264 --> 48:21.264
you can still make
me laugh like that.

48:22.866 --> 48:24.533
-Twenty years.
-Twenty years.

48:26.403 --> 48:27.670
Let me give you
your surprise.

48:27.672 --> 48:29.839
Jim, did you really
do something?

48:30.507 --> 48:31.440
I did.

48:35.078 --> 48:36.012
Jim.

48:37.414 --> 48:39.882
Jim, Jim...

48:43.220 --> 48:45.955
Jim, what are you doing?

49:07.945 --> 49:09.445
You're leaving me
here for Jesus?

49:09.447 --> 49:12.448
You know it.
Catholic school forever.

49:21.858 --> 49:23.059
That's so good.

50:11.976 --> 50:14.443
Hey, Mrs. Henderson

50:14.445 --> 50:16.112
hello Mr. Henderson.

50:18.315 --> 50:20.116
It's a very good present.

50:42.339 --> 50:43.739
I'm okay.

50:45.208 --> 50:46.308
Okay?

50:46.310 --> 50:47.643
I'm all right.

50:48.912 --> 50:49.979
I got this.

50:52.849 --> 50:55.117
I think our prom...

50:55.119 --> 50:57.987
Oh, it's really long song.

51:04.928 --> 51:08.064
Surprised, your attention
span lasts long enough.

51:08.066 --> 51:09.098
I know.

51:09.100 --> 51:10.800
Song's damn good.

51:38.161 --> 51:39.061
Yeah, there it is.

51:42.632 --> 51:45.901
That was a very nice touch.

51:45.903 --> 51:47.069
What's next?

51:49.507 --> 51:50.773
Oh yeah!

51:54.244 --> 51:55.711
-Here...
-Let's go!

51:58.215 --> 52:00.950
Backwards, this is how.

52:49.366 --> 52:50.666
Yeah.

52:50.668 --> 52:51.767
Pop.

53:09.052 --> 53:11.020
Jump, jump.

53:28.104 --> 53:29.605
Yeah, okay.

53:30.106 --> 53:32.441
Enough with the moaning.

53:32.443 --> 53:34.443
Enough of that,
take it easy.

53:34.445 --> 53:37.146
You know I was kidding
when I was on the rock

53:37.148 --> 53:38.948
but seriously...

53:38.950 --> 53:42.785
I don't want to punch
anybody as long as you rub
my head I'm good.

53:48.092 --> 53:50.292
No, that means
it's ending don't
do that.

53:50.294 --> 53:53.395
Don't do that.
I don't want
it to be over. No!

53:53.397 --> 53:54.597
Yeah, that's
enough for you.

53:54.599 --> 53:56.298
-No it's not.
-I think it is.

53:56.300 --> 53:57.366
Keep going.

53:57.368 --> 53:58.767
No, I'm not gonna
keep going, Jim.

53:58.769 --> 54:00.669
I've done this for you
like a million times,

54:00.671 --> 54:02.471
you've never done
it for me once.

54:02.473 --> 54:03.405
Not once.

54:03.407 --> 54:04.840
All right.

54:06.076 --> 54:07.176
Stretch it out.

54:07.178 --> 54:07.176
Are you kidding me?

54:07.178 --> 54:11.547
Are you kidding?
Could we please
get on with the rub?

54:11.549 --> 54:13.415
I've waited very
long time for this.

54:13.417 --> 54:16.452
You can't rush greatness, okay?
Take it easy, all right?

54:16.454 --> 54:17.920
If you want to experience

54:17.922 --> 54:20.055
the ancient art of phrenology,

54:20.057 --> 54:22.057
you really need to wait
and get that right.

54:22.059 --> 54:23.225
Come again?

54:23.227 --> 54:24.627
Okay, well if you had seen

54:24.629 --> 54:26.295
men at work the classic

54:26.297 --> 54:30.232
Charlie sheen, Emilio estevez
film, from 1990 you'd know.

54:30.234 --> 54:31.867
It's when you...

54:31.869 --> 54:34.136
You know feel and interpret
someones skull features

54:34.138 --> 54:37.306
and you kind of see
what's going on in there.
So I get up in here...

54:37.308 --> 54:39.074
And I say...

54:39.076 --> 54:42.044
See that knot right there that
says you're a terrible cook.

54:42.046 --> 54:43.212
Okay, you're shitty.

54:43.214 --> 54:44.613
Shut up.

54:45.215 --> 54:46.215
This...

54:47.884 --> 54:50.786
I'm getting this straight
from the skull features

54:50.788 --> 54:52.588
you are a lover of animals.

54:52.590 --> 54:55.691
Yeah, you knew that already
because I told you

54:55.693 --> 54:57.393
that I run a dog rescue.

54:58.728 --> 55:00.162
Tell about your doggies.

55:00.164 --> 55:02.898
Haven't really heard you
talk about it much.

55:02.900 --> 55:05.000
It was Chris' idea actually.

55:05.002 --> 55:06.201
What's that?

55:06.203 --> 55:07.369
That I open the rescue.

55:10.273 --> 55:11.940
-That's cool.
-Yeah

55:11.942 --> 55:16.478
I love the idea of you
hanging out with...

55:16.480 --> 55:19.915
Little Freddy
like gray hounds.

55:19.917 --> 55:22.051
Taken care of them,
i miss Freddy.

55:23.987 --> 55:28.324
We don't really... we don't
do the gray hound thing.

55:28.326 --> 55:32.127
What do you mean? You're like
the gray hound queen.

55:32.129 --> 55:34.830
Yeah they're just sitting around
they're not practical.

55:34.832 --> 55:36.965
Chris pointed out
and he's right

55:36.967 --> 55:38.167
that you know...

55:39.369 --> 55:40.969
We have lot
of special needs.

55:40.971 --> 55:44.273
They take a lot of work,
we are a small organization

55:44.275 --> 55:46.241
and then it's manageable.

55:47.677 --> 55:48.944
I guess I just...

55:52.449 --> 55:55.351
You love gray hounds, I mean.

55:59.522 --> 56:00.823
Yes I do.

56:02.192 --> 56:03.392
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

56:05.295 --> 56:07.696
Always think of them
as people waring fur-coat.

56:10.600 --> 56:11.967
I know.

56:11.969 --> 56:14.370
I just always have felt
understood by them.

56:20.643 --> 56:21.944
That makes sense.

56:23.113 --> 56:25.414
I don't know they want
to be around people.

56:28.084 --> 56:32.187
I don't know, feel what they
feel I can't explain it, it's...

56:32.189 --> 56:33.756
I can tell that they know

56:33.758 --> 56:36.492
that being out
in the world is hard.

56:36.494 --> 56:38.293
Yeah.

56:38.295 --> 56:42.598
And they feel it and just want
to be like nuzzled up and...

56:42.600 --> 56:44.266
They want to make
you feel better.

56:44.268 --> 56:47.136
They have that instinct
of wanting to be close
and I don 't know.

56:49.506 --> 56:53.208
And you can take a gray hound
even with all of it's things

56:53.210 --> 56:56.612
that come with owning
them or caring for them

56:56.614 --> 56:58.247
or rehabilitating them.

56:58.249 --> 57:01.917
You take the oldest,
neediest, most anxious,

57:01.919 --> 57:05.788
broken down gray hound
and if you take that dog
to the beach

57:05.790 --> 57:07.322
and you take off
his collar...

57:11.327 --> 57:13.762
He will just fucking run.

57:16.299 --> 57:17.332
Like he was still young.

57:17.334 --> 57:18.767
Yeah.

57:18.769 --> 57:20.869
Just tear down that beach.

57:20.871 --> 57:26.241
It's like sand flying
and tongue is hanging out
of his mouth and he's so...

57:28.111 --> 57:29.945
I don't know,
so beautiful.

57:36.186 --> 57:38.887
I think you should think
about working with gray hounds.

57:42.526 --> 57:43.525
Yeah.

58:35.812 --> 58:37.479
Decent amount
of stars tonight.

58:49.692 --> 58:51.026
Can I tell you something?

58:52.195 --> 58:53.128
Anything.

59:03.339 --> 59:05.340
I've been taking
anti-depressants...

59:07.644 --> 59:09.011
For a while.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.052
I haven't told anyone.

59:17.687 --> 59:19.588
You know,
not even Chris.

59:23.960 --> 59:26.662
You know,
i don't know why...

59:29.832 --> 59:31.466
I feel so embarrassed...

59:33.269 --> 59:34.369
About taking them.

59:35.905 --> 59:39.675
And it's probably because
there's nothing you know,
there's nothing wrong

59:41.511 --> 59:42.544
with my life.

59:44.347 --> 59:45.447
I should be happy.

59:50.820 --> 59:52.020
But there's this...

59:54.457 --> 59:55.390
Sadness...

59:57.460 --> 01:00:01.296
And I don't know where
it comes from.

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:07.102
Well, I can
understand that.

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:11.139
The drugs are...

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:13.642
They're weird.

01:00:13.644 --> 01:00:15.877
They're...

01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:18.347
Literally haven't cried
in five years.

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:27.022
Yeah I don't have that
particular problem myself.

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:38.634
Can I ask
you something?

01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:40.268
Anything.

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:44.606
Why don't you talk
to Chris about it?

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.317
I don't know.

01:00:58.121 --> 01:01:01.390
There was a time when I...
I would have.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:06.962
But things, things are just
kind of changing

01:01:06.964 --> 01:01:10.032
they're just, changing now.

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.471
How so?

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:20.075
Bryce is off to college
and Theo is right behind him.

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:25.247
Chris is almost 64 now.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.581
Wow!

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.583
What?

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:34.523
I mean I knew he was older
i didn't really think he
was that much older.

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:36.358
Yeah well, you know.

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:40.028
-It's not nothing.
-Yeah.

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.599
I've loved...

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:47.736
I've loved...

01:01:47.738 --> 01:01:50.605
Being a mom to those
kids you know.

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:54.976
I just, I don't know
what it's going to be like

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:58.513
when they're gone and sometimes
i look at Chris and I think...

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:01.850
Oh, my god!

01:02:01.852 --> 01:02:05.954
Am I going to be taking care
of an elderly person soon?

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:07.756
I knew it,
you know I knew it.

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.525
Going in but somehow...

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:15.630
Being faced with just the two
of us alone in the house.

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.567
I don't know.

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:19.601
It's real now.

01:02:19.603 --> 01:02:21.269
-Yeah.
-I get it.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.112
-Hey.
-Hey, what?

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:33.815
You know, I want to say
thank you.

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:36.351
Why, what for?

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:39.721
For tonight.

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:46.728
For remembering
my pink and purple jelly beans

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:50.465
you know.

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:56.238
For never making
me feel, wrong...

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.241
About who I am.

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:08.116
What?

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:10.385
I just...

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:11.453
You're embarrassed
on my behalf.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:14.122
No, just had a though
and it's...

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:15.257
What?

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:17.125
Nothing, no really...

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:20.929
I just told you something
that I never told anyone
and I thing you should...

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:22.631
I was thinking about...

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.367
Our first time.

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:29.571
In the back of this truck.
At the lake.

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.776
All 38 seconds of it.

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:39.281
Oh, shut up.
I was excited.
I was sixteen, okay?

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:42.851
I've developed some
serious skills

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:47.556
since then, in fact I've been
servicing the entire Tucson,
Arizona area...

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:50.258
-With...
-What are you, a plumber?

01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:59.768
It's funny though 'cause...

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:07.809
Never really been
like it was with us.

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:10.612
For me.

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.621
You know,
that's a nostalgia thing.

01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:20.422
Yeah.

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:22.357
-So it's...
-Yeah.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:32.968
This is same for me.

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:47.282
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:52.287
It's something about
those dumb kids.

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:54.055
Yeah.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.891
-Pain is something.
-Yeah.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:58.627
Magic.

01:04:58.629 --> 01:05:00.228
It's magic,
yeah that's right.

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:09.137
Jim?

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:10.338
Yeah.

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:16.478
Will you kiss me.

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:28.990
I know what I'm asking for...

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:58.320
I love you.

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:18.440
No.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.872
I have to go Jim.

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:56.011
-Amanda.
-Jim, please.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.146
Listen, I don't want
you to go.

01:06:58.148 --> 01:06:59.381
Please!

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:01.216
Please, will you just please
give me a minute.

01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:02.417
Okay, listen.

01:07:02.419 --> 01:07:04.786
It's confusing I get it,
okay I just want...

01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:05.720
We can talk about it.

01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:07.088
I don't want
to talk about it.

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.390
I don't want
to talk about it.

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:10.392
I should not have let
this game go on for so long.

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:11.793
This is not a game
to me though.

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:13.428
Do you understand
that I am married?

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:14.396
I understand.

01:07:14.398 --> 01:07:15.363
Do you know
what that means?

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:17.732
I belong
to someone else

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:17.732
I understand...

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:21.036
Will you please give me
a little bit of room.

01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:24.439
Fuck is my coat?

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:40.755
Where did you get this?

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.095
It was in your closet.

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:50.832
You just took it?

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:56.037
Yeah.

01:07:58.541 --> 01:07:59.374
Why?

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:00.875
Well, it's addressed to me.

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:01.810
First of all.

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:03.778
And second of all

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:07.515
I wanted to read it.

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:09.217
Well this is just
a game to you, Amanda

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:12.087
then why do you need
to read a letter that I wrote
to you 22 years ago?

01:08:12.089 --> 01:08:14.722
What is this...
What could this
possibly mean to you?

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.524
You know,
i don't know.

01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:17.992
I just wanted
to read it.

01:08:20.895 --> 01:08:22.330
This is my letter.

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:23.665
-I know that and I'm sorr...
-No

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:25.834
I don't think you
understand that.

01:08:25.836 --> 01:08:29.002
I think you need
to understand something
that this is my letter.

01:08:29.005 --> 01:08:31.272
Okay, this belongs to me.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.073
And you can't come
into my house,

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:35.676
and just take this

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:37.879
and do what ever
you want with it,

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:39.613
without asking me,

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.483
because it's mine too.

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:43.184
You understand me?

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.321
What is this?

01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:48.122
That was my baby too.

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:50.758
Okay? It was ours.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:52.961
What...

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.229
It was ours.

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:56.731
You just fucking...

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.033
Why did you?

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.604
Fucking!

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:09.810
Why did you do that?

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:10.778
Jim?

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:13.214
Why did you do that?

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:17.152
You...

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:18.620
I was a scared kid!

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:20.354
I didn't know
how to handle it.

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:21.756
You had to give me
a minute.

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:23.091
You fuckin' went away.

01:09:23.093 --> 01:09:25.760
You were the one who told me
that we were too young.

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:28.897
I was scared.
Why did you fucking do it?

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:30.365
It was our life!

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:36.837
Boy!

01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:42.143
When we were so happy.

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:52.053
We lost it.

01:09:52.055 --> 01:09:53.520
We lost everything.

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:55.823
Jim.

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:06.868
Fuck!

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:30.758
Oh god!

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:33.962
Breath.

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:38.299
Okay.

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:44.806
Take a deep
breath please.

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:47.575
I'm sorry.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.110
I'm sorry too.

01:10:49.112 --> 01:10:50.411
I'm really sorry.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:51.946
I'm really sorry too.

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:52.400
Okay.

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:56.938
I need you
to understand something.

01:12:58.974 --> 01:13:02.710
I didn't just irrationally make
the decision to do what I did.

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.613
And I know...

01:13:05.615 --> 01:13:08.383
I see now that it was
incredibly hard on you.

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:14.088
But I was the one who had to go
in there and actually do it.

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:16.824
Actually go through with it.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.326
You know?

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:23.765
And I do get that I didn't
handle it well, I didn't...

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:31.973
I just... I tortured myself.

01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:36.010
Going over the options,
alone in my bedroom.

01:13:36.012 --> 01:13:39.313
Going over and over,
what I should do.

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:44.152
And then you sent me
that stupid note.

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:50.491
Making all those weird,
sarcastic jokes and...

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:57.999
And then you sent me
that stupid get well soon
balloon, a balloon, Jim.

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:06.007
I don't know there
was something about it where

01:14:06.009 --> 01:14:09.243
it became so clear to me
that you were too young...

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:10.745
To handle it.

01:14:10.747 --> 01:14:14.015
We were too
young to handle it.

01:14:14.017 --> 01:14:17.552
And I knew that I was gonna
have to go through it alone
and I knew I couldn't,

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:19.120
do it alone.

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:23.491
And you know...

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:29.897
Do I have regrets? Yes.

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:31.432
Yes.

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:34.402
But...

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:38.139
What can we do?

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:40.141
Here.

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:46.080
Please. You just read it now.

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:04.866
"Amanda, I know we can
get through this together.

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:08.603
You are my world.

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:12.373
I will never
stop loving you."

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.512
It was the first version
that I wrote to you.

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:26.621
Why didn't you
send this to me?

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.424
I was scared.

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:37.198
It was just stupid.
I'm sorry.

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:17.471
I'm contagious.

01:16:17.473 --> 01:16:19.006
Apparently.

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:34.322
Now it's just
never gonna stop.
