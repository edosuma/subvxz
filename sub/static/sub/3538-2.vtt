in the battle with Satan,

16:25.011 --> 16:27.720
armed with but a song
and a smile!

16:27.804 --> 16:29.845
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:29.929 --> 16:33.470
your own Sister Molly!

17:00.011 --> 17:02.637
Yesterday I met
a gentleman on the street,

17:02.720 --> 17:05.470
and a gentleman he was--

17:05.553 --> 17:08.011
a fine-tailored suit,

17:08.095 --> 17:11.762
sharp arrow collar,
and ten-dollar Florsheims.

17:11.845 --> 17:13.804
And he said to me,

17:13.887 --> 17:17.303
"Sister, I'm what
you call a diplomat.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.887
I've traveled
all over the world,

17:20.970 --> 17:23.845
and I've looked high and low
for the Lord,

17:23.929 --> 17:26.136
but where is he?

17:26.220 --> 17:28.428
I didn't find him in Rangoon.

17:28.512 --> 17:30.136
I didn't find him in Caracas.

17:30.220 --> 17:32.470
I didn't even find him
in Des Moines."

17:33.887 --> 17:35.887
"Where the heck's He hiding?"

17:37.762 --> 17:41.178
Well, I was enthralled.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.720
A diplomat.
My word.

17:43.804 --> 17:45.804
- That's a first for me.

17:45.887 --> 17:48.720
So I said,
"Brother, tell me more."

French Foreign Legion fort

20:33.053 --> 20:34.679
in the middle of the desert,

20:34.762 --> 20:36.887
and all these Arabs are
about to attack.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.220
All the other soldiers are
already dead, right?

20:39.303 --> 20:41.345
So they put the dead bodies
around the fort

20:41.428 --> 20:43.804
so the Arabs will think
that there's a shitload of them

20:43.887 --> 20:44.804

20:58.720 --> 21:00.345

21:04.887 --> 21:06.303

21:06.387 --> 21:07.887

21:07.970 --> 21:09.220

21:09.303 --> 21:11.053
I'll start going through these

21:11.136 --> 21:12.845

21:48.387 --> 21:50.095
What the heck's a parapet?

21:50.178 --> 21:53.762
It's a wall up at the top for
the places for the soldiers.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.720
Not for money, not for food.

33:50.804 --> 33:54.303
They did it
because of a road...

Of course.

Yes, ma'am.

36:02.970 --> 36:06.261
I'm here about James Hazlett.
You knew him, I understand.

36:06.345 --> 36:07.637
That's right.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.887
He is, um...

36:09.970 --> 36:13.470
Was  a deacon at our temple.

36:14.679 --> 36:17.679
A fine, tall man.

36:17.762 --> 36:20.679
I feel his loss greatly.

36:20.762 --> 36:22.970
He was involved
in the finances, wasn't he?

36:23.053 --> 36:24.512
I believe so.

36:24.595 --> 36:27.470
Uh, my mother oversees
that part of the business.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.970
I do other things.

36:30.053 --> 36:33.470
Yes, I-I know that.
I saw you earlier today.

36:35.053 --> 36:36.387
How was I?

36:38.929 --> 36:41.887
Uh, great,
and the songs were great.

36:43.428 --> 36:45.303
Everyone likes the tunes.

37:00.220 --> 37:03.178
- Do you think he was tall?
- Hmm?

37:03.261 --> 37:06.220
Mr. Hazlett--you said he was
"a fine, tall man."

37:07.845 --> 37:12.512
I-I meant tall
as in upstanding.

37:12.595 --> 37:13.595
That's what I meant.

37:13.679 --> 37:15.220
Hmm.

37:15.303 --> 37:16.679
Did you know him well?

37:16.762 --> 37:18.387
Oh, not especially.

37:18.470 --> 37:21.804
Um, we had dinner at his house
once last year.

37:21.887 --> 37:24.720
Oh, no, um,
it was the year before,

37:24.804 --> 37:27.261
my mother and I.

37:27.345 --> 37:29.595
But I found it's difficult

37:29.679 --> 37:31.428
getting too close
to the parishioners.

37:32.804 --> 37:34.261
Why's that?

37:34.345 --> 37:37.261
- They become attached.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.887
Did Mr. Hazlett?

37:39.970 --> 37:42.553
No.

37:42.637 --> 37:46.595
He was always very levelheaded.

37:46.679 --> 37:49.595
Even-keeled, I'd say.

37:50.553 --> 37:54.011
But as I say, uh, we don't like
to get too friendly,

37:54.095 --> 37:55.804
lest they become attached.

37:55.887 --> 37:59.595
Aren't they attached to you
anyway, your parishioners?

37:59.679 --> 38:02.970
Well, to the temple, not to me.

38:03.053 --> 38:05.136
I'm "that woman on the stage"

38:05.220 --> 38:08.261
or "that voice on the radio."

38:08.345 --> 38:12.887
Otherwise I don't really exist.

38:12.970 --> 38:15.804
Hey, fella,
get back to the truck.

38:15.887 --> 38:18.220
No, it's fine.

38:18.303 --> 38:20.303
We're just talking.

38:41.220 --> 38:45.011
Oh, well,
it becomes a distraction.

38:45.095 --> 38:47.929
I'm too famous, it seems.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.261
And I like it back here.

Why's that?

38:54.595 --> 38:56.762
You are a detective.

It's quiet back here.

39:03.011 --> 39:05.303
My life is...

39:05.387 --> 39:07.970
Well, it's busy.

39:08.053 --> 39:10.637
I tour, I do the radio show,

39:10.720 --> 39:13.303
and record the songs.

39:13.387 --> 39:15.428
But I didn't get into it
for all that.

39:15.512 --> 39:20.303
My calling is pastoral.
I-I just want to help people.

39:20.387 --> 39:23.887
Same reason you chose to join
the police force, I suppose.

39:23.970 --> 39:25.428
I guess so.

39:25.512 --> 39:27.220
But you're not sure?

39:28.887 --> 39:33.762
No, I'm sure.

39:33.845 --> 39:36.929
I didn't have much
of a choice, really.

39:37.011 --> 39:40.470
My mother had me on the revival
circuit when I was four.

39:40.553 --> 39:44.178
I would sing a song,
and she would pass the hat.

39:44.261 --> 39:48.178

39:48.261 --> 39:51.220
We went from town to town
all over Nebraska.

40:02.595 --> 40:03.887

40:07.470 --> 40:09.095
Uh, can you get me

40:19.095 --> 40:20.595
You read the paper?

40:20.679 --> 40:22.720
They say it's gonna be
Bette Davis now.

40:22.804 --> 40:24.178
Bette Davis?

40:24.261 --> 40:26.053
This is a teenage
Southern belle.

40:26.136 --> 40:27.595
You explain that to me.

40:27.679 --> 40:30.220
I couldn't even lift
the damn book, it's so heavy.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.595

tailoring trousers.

on the break--

40:46.136 --> 40:47.303
I get it.

40:47.387 --> 40:49.512
You cannot tell me
that Bette Davis

40:49.595 --> 40:52.220
is an 18-year-old
Southern belle and a virgin.

40:52.303 --> 40:54.136
- That woman is no virgin.
- Exactly.

40:54.220 --> 40:55.470
And you know this how?

40:55.553 --> 40:57.553
You mean Scarlett
or Bette Davis?

40:57.637 --> 41:00.345
Scarlett's the virgin,
at least to start.

41:00.428 --> 41:02.595

- Cowardly.
- No, six letters.

Hey, hey.
Here they come.

41:27.679 --> 41:29.595
What?
They met someone inside?

41:29.679 --> 41:32.804
He's just a kid.

41:35.011 --> 41:36.929
I'm telling you, Lewis.

41:37.011 --> 41:38.428
You should call the FBI.

41:38.512 --> 41:40.845
You think Hoover gives a shit
about the Jews?

41:40.929 --> 41:42.762
Ask Emma Goldman.

41:42.845 --> 41:45.553
- Call the Army or something.
- I don't trust them.

41:45.637 --> 41:49.345
You, I trust...more or less.

41:49.428 --> 41:52.095
So a bunch of old Jews are
gonna prevent the Third Reich

41:52.178 --> 41:53.387
