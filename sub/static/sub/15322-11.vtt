WEBVTT

02:16.261 --> 02:18.843
Ijust wanted to make sure
you were okay.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.175
You weren't answering
your phone.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.429
Sorry, Ijust needed some time.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.927
You did all you could for him.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.022
How about you?

02:31.109 --> 02:33.395
Are you okay?

02:33.445 --> 02:36.061
Jen asked me to leave.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.857
I think my marriage is over.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.718
Sorry, I don't have very much.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.394
Do you want coffee?

03:09.481 --> 03:10.812
Sure.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.488
Time off, huh?

03:20.534 --> 03:24.823
And people say being relentless
is a bad thing.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.827
Hmm.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.613
He will remember.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.579
Someday.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.243
What did Jen say?

03:33.255 --> 03:35.871
Uh, that, um...

03:35.924 --> 03:39.416
I, uh... keep secrets,
that, uh...

03:39.469 --> 03:41.084
she doesn't know me anymore.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.550
She just needs a few days
to cool off.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.299
Nah, she's right.
I don't tell her anything.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.434
Haven't been able to for years.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.929
She doesn't want to know
about a kid our daughter's age

03:51.940 --> 03:56.274
I pulled from a pond
with her... neck sliced open.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.446
Half-eaten by animals.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.527
So Ijust tell her I'm fine,
you know,

04:02.576 --> 04:06.535
and that I'm just moving up
the ladder and-- you know.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.367
I mean, we talk about,
well, retirement.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.499
Buying a boat.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.832
But I don't want to buy a boat,
and I don't want to retire.

04:17.674 --> 04:22.134
I mean, this is the only thing
that makes any sense to me.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.966
Sometimes I think
that people like us,

04:25.015 --> 04:27.472
we were just
supposed to be alone.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.724
That's not true.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.564
She was Kallie's friend.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.192
How did you know her?

06:49.367 --> 06:52.859
She... helped me
with things.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.622
We were sort of friends.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.117
Bullet would have hated
that photo.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.960
That's the way her folks
want to remember her.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.458
The way they imagined her
to be.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.797
Not the way she was.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.805
I told Bullet this story
about how I used to play

07:17.854 --> 07:21.472
this game with Kallie
when she was little.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.140
I'd close my eyes
and count to five,

07:24.194 --> 07:26.810
and then when I'd open them
she'd still be standing there.

07:30.825 --> 07:33.817
If only it was that easy, huh?

07:36.790 --> 07:39.577
She took care of your daughter.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.418
Tried to protect her
as best she could.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.413
She was like a little pit bull.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.797
She was just a little kid.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.259
They all were.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.768
Sarah.

08:51.156 --> 08:54.444
Hey. Um...

08:54.492 --> 08:57.905
Before you say anything, um...

08:57.954 --> 09:00.036
Hi.

09:00.081 --> 09:03.039
Hi.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.165
I think you're wrong.

09:08.173 --> 09:12.382
I think...
that we can be different.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.143
Stephen?

09:39.621 --> 09:42.613
I'm sorry.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.375
I messed up.

10:07.649 --> 10:11.517
I-I should have told you
about my past.

10:11.569 --> 10:15.187
You're a step up for me.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.697
Okay? And I'm a step down
for you.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.984
I'm-- I'm like
five steps down for you.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.824
And Iju-- Ijust wanted you
to see the good stuff.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.495
That is what I see.

10:36.386 --> 10:39.128
Answer it.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.304
They're just gonna keep
calling you.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.393
Yeah.
Detective Holder.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.513
Yeah, I'll be there.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.023
All right, just tell him
to wait for me.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.363
Clock never stops.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.196
So...
I'll see you later.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.027
Okay?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.490
Yeah?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.656
Yeah, Stephen.

11:09.252 --> 11:12.369
We had a fight.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.038
It happens.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.583
And for what it's worth,

11:18.595 --> 11:20.927
you're actually
a half-step up...

11:20.930 --> 11:22.795
for me.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.464
You must have been hanging out

11:24.517 --> 11:26.473
with some real losers
before me.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.604
Mm. Lawyers.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.276
Okay. Okay.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.984
Just go do your thing.
All right?

12:57.652 --> 12:58.812
You leaving?

13:01.698 --> 13:04.656
I got too much going on
at home.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.659
I put in my papers
and took my pension.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.660
The guys know yet?

13:09.706 --> 13:10.866
Nah.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.497
I'll give you odds
it'll be two weeks

13:13.543 --> 13:15.534
before they even notice
I'm gone.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.586
Don't get too comfortable
here, Evan.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.223
I spent half my life
in this place.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.806
Just as much a prisoner
as the rest of them.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.102
I think I'll be okay.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.403
Yeah.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.405
You'll do fine.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.612
Good luck.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.791
That's as far
as it came out.

14:44.467 --> 14:47.300
You're late.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.170
I thought you'd be halfway
to Chicago by now.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.682
.45.
Two more in the backseat.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.513
Fire was probably set
yesterday afternoon.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.348
Guy who opened the yard
this morning found it.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.014
Fireman called us
when they found the body.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.523
They don't got
no security here?

15:02.568 --> 15:04.900
Not on Sunday, apparently.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.062
Not sure whether we got a John
or a Jane Doe.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.901
Coroner's en route.

15:08.908 --> 15:12.071
You interview the guy
who called it in?

15:12.120 --> 15:14.236
I thought I'd wait for you.

15:14.288 --> 15:18.873
Oh. So, this is for real then?
Detective Linden.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.538
You're not gonna
peace out on me,

15:21.546 --> 15:24.253
leave me to crime-fight
with jank-ass Jablonski?

15:24.257 --> 15:27.715
Well, you're my ride, so...

15:27.760 --> 15:29.876
I guess you're stuck with me.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.385
Good.

15:31.431 --> 15:35.891
I mean, not that I need you.
But it's good.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.391
You look nice.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.393
I see you changed
your... thingy.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.554
Mm-hmm.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.268
- And shaved. Kind of.
- Yep.

15:43.276 --> 15:47.110
Even got a shower.
Got to keep fresh.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.776
One step at a time.

15:52.910 --> 15:57.028
Damn.
That's a crispy critter.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.366
Let's do some work.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.372
Yeah.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.171
Number 21,
your order is ready.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.668
Chicken sandwich to go.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.930
Are you done?
Can I clear this for you?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.476
You were at the church
this morning.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.265
I'm Kallie's mom.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.355
I should probably
get back to work.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.016
I never had a job
when I was your age.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.731
I was too busy
messing around with boys

16:29.739 --> 16:31.730
and partying.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.072
Plus I had Kallie.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.986
Number 2 combo.

16:35.036 --> 16:38.528
Well... I haven't seen her
in a while, so...

16:38.539 --> 16:40.200
Oh, do you know her?

16:40.208 --> 16:44.167
Yeah. I mean... kind of.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.877
Her and Bullet
were always hanging around.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.917
I'm really sorry
what happened to Bullet.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.633
I'm sorry.

16:56.682 --> 17:00.470
No, no. Hey, hey, look.
It's okay.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.136
I never had
a lot of girlfriends.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.305
I didn't want the competition,
I guess,

17:05.358 --> 17:08.065
but Kallie knew better.

17:08.110 --> 17:11.398
It's good to have girls around.
Remember that.

17:11.447 --> 17:14.109
Okay.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.113
I should probably
get back to work.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.948
You have really pretty hair.

17:19.997 --> 17:23.034
It would look good short, too.
You ever cut it short?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.703
Number 1 9, your order's up.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.871
No.

17:26.921 --> 17:30.084
You do hair, right?
Kallie told me.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.297
I could...
do your hair sometime.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.837
I mean, like
if you wanted me to.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.848
Could blow it out or cut it
or curl it--

17:40.893 --> 17:43.350
it'd be on me.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.431
Yeah?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.766
Yeah. Anytime.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.765
Number 27, your order's ready.

17:48.776 --> 17:52.564
Thanks.
Maybe I will.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.403
See ya.

18:03.958 --> 18:08.418
Oh! Shh... ohh.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.623
Mnh.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.138
S-sorry,
H can come back later.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.017
Stay. I'm leaving.

19:08.189 --> 19:11.181
I was out of my mind.

19:13.444 --> 19:17.062
I put in for a new partner.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.193
Brass put me in with Jablonski.

19:20.242 --> 19:23.484
Guess I have you
to thank for that.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.152
How many solves you think
I'm gonna get

19:25.206 --> 19:26.742
with a guy
who looks like fat Hitler?

19:30.878 --> 19:35.212
Don't think
you're not still a dick.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.044
Deedee's liable to shoot you
in the skull

19:38.052 --> 19:41.761
you ever try to set foot
in our house again.

19:43.557 --> 19:48.051
She called Skinner,
filed a formal complaint.

19:48.062 --> 19:50.724
Wants to call in the damn dogs.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.852
Don't worry.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.393
I talked to them,
told them we were all good.

19:59.448 --> 20:03.612
Guess I'm old school.
Cops don't rat on cops.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.110
You can thank my TO for that.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.115
Thanks.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.751
I'll owe you.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.459
You already do.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.554
Hey.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.063
Packing up?

20:35.109 --> 20:37.395
Yeah, we're... we're taking
the rest of the files

20:37.445 --> 20:38.935
to the DA this afternoon.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.775
He's gonna be formally
charging Joe Mills.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.608
And my, uh...
the chief is talking

20:45.661 --> 20:48.277
about expanding the scope
of my team.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.786
So it looks like I'm gonna be
keeping this office

20:49.832 --> 20:51.288
for a little while.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.415
I'll be cherry-picking
the big cases,

20:53.461 --> 20:55.622
the headline makers.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.290
I'm very happy for you.

20:57.298 --> 21:01.132
Well, I couldn't
have done it without you.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.803
You know, it's funny.
This morning...

21:09.810 --> 21:12.643
Iwas, um...

21:12.646 --> 21:14.978
I was thinking about
how you used to sing

21:14.982 --> 21:16.813
in the car.

21:16.817 --> 21:17.977
Sing?

21:17.985 --> 21:19.270
Yeah, you used to do it
all the time.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.936
- I never do that.
- Yeah.

21:21.989 --> 21:25.607
Used to sing the same song
for days under your breath.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.950
Used to drive me crazy.

21:27.995 --> 21:31.112
I missed it.

21:31.165 --> 21:32.530
You know?

21:32.583 --> 21:33.948
You don't do it anymore?
You sure?

21:34.001 --> 21:35.241
No, I don't do that anymore.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.457
Oh, man, that's too bad.

21:38.506 --> 21:41.669
- Holder's missing out.
- Hmm.

21:41.675 --> 21:45.668
You know, um...

21:45.679 --> 21:48.466
I'm gonna be at the lake
for the next-- for a few days.

21:48.516 --> 21:51.974
Why don't you cut out early,
pack a bag...

21:52.019 --> 21:54.180
come and join me
for the weekend?

21:54.271 --> 21:56.683
I would love to.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.188
Mm-hmm.

21:58.275 --> 22:01.017
We caught a body...

22:01.070 --> 22:03.903
burned up-- it's gonna be hard
to even get an ID.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.737
Why don't you just give it
to someone else, Sarah?

22:05.741 --> 22:08.073
Use the rest,
use some time by the lake.

22:08.077 --> 22:11.240
I'll build a fire,
get some wine.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.202
Uh, s-sorry.
Collins said you were here.

22:15.251 --> 22:18.869
- So, uh, the coroner's got
something for us. - Mm-hmm.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.380
Okay.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.540
Um, it's our case,
so I should go.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.383
Maybe
I'll s-see you later.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.048
Yeah.

22:37.940 --> 22:41.228
So, um...

22:41.610 --> 22:44.898
what up with you
and the boss man?

22:44.947 --> 22:47.279
Nothing. What?

22:47.283 --> 22:51.071
Going to the lake?
Making a fire?

22:51.120 --> 22:52.451
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.705
Oh, come on, Linden.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.529
I mean, I don't got to be
my sleuth par excellence

22:55.624 --> 22:57.831
to see that the cat's got
the hand in the jelly jar.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.034
And it ain't the first time,
neither.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.715
We worked together,
we were partners, and...

23:06.760 --> 23:09.376
And... and... and...

23:09.430 --> 23:12.046
And we...

23:12.099 --> 23:13.214
Oh!

23:13.267 --> 23:14.382
Don't--
don't do that.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.720
Snap!

23:15.769 --> 23:17.225
Don't do that.
Don't look at me like that.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.556
How many times?

23:18.606 --> 23:20.062
One time? Two times?

23:20.107 --> 23:22.268
Three times?
Stop me at anytime, Linden.

23:22.276 --> 23:23.561
Four times?
Five times?

23:23.611 --> 23:25.067
You're such an idiot.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.398
You are a human being.
You're actual flesh and blood.

23:27.448 --> 23:28.904
Aw.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.065
I mean, I'm just as surprised
as you are.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.074
You jealous?

23:33.162 --> 23:35.744
Oh, well played,
Detective Linden.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.288
- Well played.
- Right.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.245
I'm gonna do some work
if that's all right with you.

23:40.294 --> 23:42.580
Do your thing, 1-900.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.266
One...

24:49.113 --> 24:50.774
two...

24:52.783 --> 24:54.444
three...

24:56.620 --> 24:58.281
four...

25:00.624 --> 25:01.909
five...

25:32.322 --> 25:34.813
Sounds good.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.204
Estimated time of death--

27:10.254 --> 27:12.370
sometime yesterday afternoon,
early evening.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.549
Stomach contents
were partially digested.

27:14.591 --> 27:16.547
Gunshot to the head,
point-blank range,

27:16.593 --> 27:17.673
and two to the chest.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.630
Execution style.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.630
.45 could be
a drug murder.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.630
Male, female?

27:23.684 --> 27:25.640
Female,
judging from the pelvis.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.431
I'll need more time
before I can give you her age.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.095
Any prints?

27:30.149 --> 27:32.606
Good luck getting any.
He torched her.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.937
Made sure no prints
are coming off this body.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.103
CSU pulled some partials
from the backseat.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.239
Could be hers.
Do you have anything else?

27:40.284 --> 27:43.617
Well, this is interesting.

27:43.620 --> 27:46.737
He took out all her teeth.
Postmortem.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.707
Never seen anything like it.

27:52.337 --> 27:56.671
Linden.
Her ring finger's missing.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.339
Was it burned off?

28:01.346 --> 28:05.180
No. And lacerations to the bone
are ragged, uneven.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.516
Whatever took the finger off,
it wasn't surgical either.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.010
- Hunting knife?
- Could be.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.560
The bone's partially healed.
This wasn't a new injury.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.224
When did it happen?

28:15.277 --> 28:17.438
- I couldn't be certain.
- Can you guess?

28:17.529 --> 28:20.111
Two weeks ago, tops.

28:22.743 --> 28:24.699
It's the same
ring finger missing.

28:24.786 --> 28:28.074
Cut off two weeks ago?
Just like Angie Gower.

28:28.165 --> 28:29.621
You know her?

28:47.517 --> 28:49.428
She was shot.
It's not his MO.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.601
We know that he cuts them.

28:51.647 --> 28:54.684
And anyway, we don't even know
if it's Angie.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.190
Burnt the body
so we couldn't ID it.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.272
Pulled out her teeth one by one

28:59.321 --> 29:00.902
'cause he didn't want her ID'd.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.729
He tied up the last loose end.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.739
Angie Gower
was a street prostitute.

29:04.785 --> 29:06.116
It's a high-risk
population.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.534
Someone else could have
killed her.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.739
I know you don't believe that.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.739
Joe Mills had the rings.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.581
He killed Bullet
just like the others.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.538
He put her
in the back of his cab.

29:15.545 --> 29:18.708
Who would have known

29:18.715 --> 29:22.207
Mills was our
number-one suspect?

29:22.261 --> 29:24.718
We didn't make it public.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.551
Bullet called headquarters
the night she was killed.

29:28.600 --> 29:32.764
And SPD was all over
that storage unit.

29:34.564 --> 29:36.350
Think about
what you're saying, Holder.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.685
Only a cop could have had access
to our files

29:37.734 --> 29:39.019
and known about Mills.

29:39.069 --> 29:42.607
Only a cop could have found
that storage unit before us.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.942
Planted those trophies.

30:05.637 --> 30:09.095
If our victim's Angie,
and if our guy's a cop,

30:09.141 --> 30:10.756
this case is closed.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.676
Holder, they're-- they're
charging Joe Mills as we speak.

30:13.729 --> 30:17.347
Got to call Skinner.
Tell him to stall.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.685
Do you have any idea
what this is gonna do to him?

30:19.735 --> 30:22.693
To his career, his life?

30:22.738 --> 30:24.569
What do you want to do,
sit on it?

30:24.614 --> 30:26.866
And if you're right,
Joe Mills will probably walk.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.445
- He could be innocent.
- Yeah, but he's not innocent.

30:29.453 --> 30:32.286
He takes girls
into some filthy backroom,

30:32.289 --> 30:34.280
makes them take their
clothes off, and films them.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.657
That don't make him a killer.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.828
What do you want to do,

30:37.878 --> 30:39.743
let the state hang another guy
who didn't do it?

31:48.532 --> 31:50.693
I got the file.
Let's go.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.582
Slim pickings.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.919
Most everything's
with the DA now.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.588
I mean,
I could call Caroline...

32:10.637 --> 32:13.470
We don't tell anybody
until we're sure.

32:16.726 --> 32:19.217
Gonna take a look at those
anytime soon?

32:25.735 --> 32:28.351
Victims' names and addresses...

32:28.405 --> 32:30.896
time line from the coroner.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.738
Most of this stuff
is about Joe Mills.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.745
Find Kallie's ring
in that storage facility?

32:42.794 --> 32:44.580
No.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.541
Who was the first victim?

32:47.591 --> 32:48.580
Why?

32:48.592 --> 32:50.924
Angie said he put her
in the backseat.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.925
Watched her
through the rearview.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.757
You know, made her feel
like a prisoner.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.923
Or...

32:57.976 --> 33:01.264
like a criminal in
the backseat of a cop car.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.804
Maybe that's how it started--
with an arrest.

33:03.857 --> 33:05.518
That's why he puts them
in the backseat.

33:05.525 --> 33:08.517
He's-- he's chasing
that first kill.

33:11.615 --> 33:14.573
You gonna try to help me
with this or not?

33:14.618 --> 33:16.449
Who's the first victim?

33:17.787 --> 33:21.371
Brigitte Delahanty.
Killed early June 2009.

33:21.374 --> 33:24.741
What's the address?

33:26.296 --> 33:29.459
She stopped talking
to me, stopped coming home.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.089
She changed.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.799
It was the drugs.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.632
She was like a monster
when she was high.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.965
She would get violent,
steal things...

33:40.018 --> 33:42.634
forge checks.

33:42.687 --> 33:45.429
I couldn't have her
in the house with my son.

33:45.524 --> 33:48.061
I thought you caught the guy.

33:48.109 --> 33:51.442
We're just following up
before the case goes to trial.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.612
Was Brigitte ever arrested?

33:53.657 --> 33:56.273
Yeah.
Sure. A few times.

33:56.326 --> 33:59.318
Possession, solicitation--
you name it.

33:59.329 --> 34:02.321
She even solicited
an undercover police officer.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.330
- Do you have a name for that officer?
- No.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.994
Look, it was
a long time ago, okay?

34:09.047 --> 34:10.662
Is this important
for the trial?

34:10.715 --> 34:12.671
The DA is just
trying to anticipate

34:12.717 --> 34:14.298
anything that could come up.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.503
She was doing better, you know?

34:18.515 --> 34:21.302
Then she just took off again.

34:21.351 --> 34:24.343
I'm sorry for your loss.

34:24.396 --> 34:27.012
That's it?

34:27.065 --> 34:29.522
Yeah, like I said,
we're just following up.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.025
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Delahanty.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.150
We'll be in touch.

34:33.196 --> 34:35.061
You think they're gonna ask
for the death penalty?

34:35.073 --> 34:38.065
- Probably.
- I hope so.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.192
I want to be there
when they do it.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.906
Thank you again for your time.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.911
If anything comes up,
here's my card.

34:43.957 --> 34:46.539
Feel free to call me anytime
at this number.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.452
Linden.

34:58.471 --> 35:01.429
- You know Carl?
- How do you know him?

35:01.474 --> 35:02.930
Oh, he used to live next door.

35:02.976 --> 35:05.683
He, uh, moved
after Brigitte disappeared.

35:05.729 --> 35:08.971
He's the one that got her
in the Junior Officers program.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.060
She said she wanted to be a cop.

35:11.109 --> 35:15.603
He, uh... he came to tell us
they had identified her body.

35:15.614 --> 35:19.607
Meant a lot
that he remembered her.

35:27.083 --> 35:30.041
Reddick never once mentioned
he knew one of the victims.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.042
He knows we have Joe Mills.

35:32.088 --> 35:34.374
If he's our guy,
he's gonna get away with it.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.881
Why would he risk
killing Angie Gower?

35:36.926 --> 35:39.178
'Cause she could ID him.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.721
Maybe she saw him
at the hospital.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.720
I mean, it could explain
why she bolted.

35:42.766 --> 35:45.052
Bullet called SPD
the night she got killed,

35:45.101 --> 35:46.932
and Reddick took that message.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.469
Okay.

35:49.522 --> 35:52.480
He introduces Brigitte
to the Junior Officers.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.140
He sees her all the time
in the program,

35:54.152 --> 35:55.141
in the neighborhood.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.644
He gets to know her,
and then what?

35:57.697 --> 35:59.153
Why does he kill her?

35:59.157 --> 36:01.523
I mean, I know this guy.

36:01.534 --> 36:04.150
Worked with him for a year.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.570
It doesn't explain
Trisha Seward.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.131
What?

36:18.176 --> 36:20.508
The killer was never
after Trisha.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.714
Unlock the car.

36:26.059 --> 36:27.720
Do you have a map in here?

36:27.769 --> 36:29.930
Yeah, in the glove box.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.026
Okay.

36:40.073 --> 36:43.065
Seward built his kid
a tree house.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.567
He was staying
in public housing here.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.737
- So what? - So, there's-- there's no
parks anywhere near that complex.

36:48.790 --> 36:52.203
There's no trees.
Look.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.043
The nearest trees
to Seward's apartment--

36:55.088 --> 36:56.578
here.

36:56.589 --> 36:59.752
That's where the bodies
were buried.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.550
Damn.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.777
Hey. How much longer
we got to be out here?

37:20.822 --> 37:23.655
Anyway, it's over a mile from
here to the kid's apartment.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.816
Trisha and Ray
used to fight all the time.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.985
There were dozens
of domestic-abuse calls.

37:28.037 --> 37:31.780
Adrian slept in a closet.
He was lonely, scared.

37:31.833 --> 37:35.496
Still, a mile is a long way
for a little kid.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.118
In my first foster home,

37:37.172 --> 37:40.630
the lady used to cry
all day long every day.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.256
I'd wait until
I couldn't stand it anymore,

37:42.302 --> 37:44.258
unUIIthought
that I was gonna explode

37:44.304 --> 37:46.135
if I stayed another minute.

37:46.181 --> 37:50.049
And then I'd run.
Every couple days I'd run.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.387
And they would find me
and they would bring me back,

37:52.395 --> 37:54.101
and then I would run again.

37:54.105 --> 37:57.768
Adrian's a runner, too.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.348
What the hell you doing?

38:35.355 --> 38:37.220
Ohh!

38:37.232 --> 38:39.723
Hey, you're gonna break
your damn neck.

38:50.578 --> 38:53.741
He built Adrian
a tree house in the woods.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.733
Trisha Seward was killed
December 26th.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.393
These trees
would have been bare.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.402
So what?

39:27.448 --> 39:29.234
Go to the edge of the pond.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.121
They saw each other.

40:21.961 --> 40:25.795
He wasn't coming to the
apartment to kill Trisha.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.460
He was coming to kill Adrian.
