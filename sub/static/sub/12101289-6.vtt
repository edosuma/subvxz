00:01.002 --> 00:03.006
[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.089 --> 00:05.469
You have to tell me
where the Handmaids are.

00:05.553 --> 00:07.139
Or they will hurt Hannah.

00:07.223 --> 00:08.141
It's okay, baby.

00:09.018 --> 00:11.022
They're at the Murrow farmhouse.

00:11.105 --> 00:12.526
I tried to run with her.

00:12.609 --> 00:13.485
I really tried.

00:13.569 --> 00:15.865
We'll find her. I swear.

00:15.949 --> 00:18.746
She was scared of me.
My baby was scared of me.

00:18.829 --> 00:20.833
She didn't know me.

00:20.917 --> 00:22.963
Everything that has
happened to you,

00:23.004 --> 00:25.384
to Hannah,
to Janine and the others,

00:25.467 --> 00:26.804
you're responsible.

00:26.887 --> 00:27.931
Your fault.

00:28.014 --> 00:30.310
‐[Luke] Did she choose this?
‐No, she didn't choose this.

00:30.394 --> 00:32.189
She chose to stay in Gilead.

00:32.273 --> 00:33.818
Die trying to do something good.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.907
It's just she knew she'd
never see either of us again.

00:36.991 --> 00:38.744
That's a choice that she made.

00:38.828 --> 00:40.289
[Oona] You look cute. [chuckles]

00:41.542 --> 00:44.506
I leave for the resupply
to Thunder Bay tomorrow night.

00:44.590 --> 00:46.050
‐Can I come over later?
‐Text me.

00:48.514 --> 00:50.475
I love Nichole
but I never wanted to be a mom.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.479
Why do you feel you have to
clean up June's messes?

00:52.564 --> 00:53.858
[Moira] Making up for
when I got out

00:53.941 --> 00:55.027
and she didn't, I guess.

00:56.154 --> 00:57.741
I'm tired of feeling guilty.

00:57.824 --> 00:59.870
Two Handmaids were spotted
heading into Chicago.

00:59.953 --> 01:01.790
Maybe June was one of them.

01:02.166 --> 01:03.794
‐[June] Who did this?
‐[Steven] Nighthawks

01:03.878 --> 01:04.963
They don't care
if they live or die.

01:05.047 --> 01:06.299
They just wanna kill soldiers.

01:06.382 --> 01:07.217
You'd love 'em.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.303
[June] I think
we should go tomorrow

01:08.386 --> 01:09.221
and find the Nighthawks.

01:09.305 --> 01:10.432
We came here to fight.

01:11.059 --> 01:12.562
June, you came here to fight.

01:12.646 --> 01:16.152
I propose that we declare
a temporary ceasefire

01:16.235 --> 01:17.781
along our contested borders.

01:17.864 --> 01:19.492
Gilead's forces
in disputed areas

01:19.576 --> 01:21.245
will stand out for 24 hours
starting this afternoon.

01:21.329 --> 01:22.707
Commander Blaine,
you will coordinate

01:22.791 --> 01:26.297
an aerial bombardment
on all insurgent fronts.

01:26.381 --> 01:27.634
[Janine] Where are the soldiers?

01:27.717 --> 01:28.928
They must have left in a hurry.

01:29.011 --> 01:30.640
[airplanes approaching]

01:31.224 --> 01:32.142
‐[explosion]
‐Run!

01:41.035 --> 01:42.329
Janine!

01:45.920 --> 01:46.755
June?

02:02.620 --> 02:03.747
[Moira] June?

02:09.551 --> 02:10.553
June!

02:15.563 --> 02:16.481
June?

02:16.565 --> 02:19.821
Mimosas do not
pour themselves, June.

02:19.905 --> 02:21.617
[slow music playing]

02:37.356 --> 02:39.736
It is really coming down
out there.

02:40.403 --> 02:43.451
Looks like we're gonna be
stuck here all day.

02:43.536 --> 02:44.913
Oh, damn!

02:45.497 --> 02:48.253
And all those errands
we were gonna run.

02:49.213 --> 02:50.340
Cheers.

02:50.423 --> 02:51.927
[chuckles]

02:54.223 --> 02:55.726
[cell phone buzzing]

03:06.330 --> 03:07.165
[buzzing stops]

03:08.293 --> 03:09.796
‐Thank you.
‐Mmm‐hmm.

03:10.882 --> 03:12.134
[sighs]

03:15.766 --> 03:17.060
[laughs]

03:19.148 --> 03:20.150
[Moira] June?

03:22.739 --> 03:23.741
June.

03:31.965 --> 03:32.842
June?

03:32.925 --> 03:34.846
[man] Get back from there,
it's not stable!

03:34.929 --> 03:36.265
[woman screams]

03:37.977 --> 03:41.192
Holy shit. June, it's me. Moira.

03:42.904 --> 03:44.908
[indistinct shouting]

03:48.916 --> 03:51.045
Your friend, Moira.

03:52.507 --> 03:54.636
June, do you...
Do you remember me?

03:55.638 --> 03:57.432
‐Moira got out.
‐What?

03:57.517 --> 03:59.186
‐No. I'm right here, I'm okay.
‐Janine?

03:59.688 --> 04:00.815
Huh? June?

04:01.900 --> 04:02.902
Janine!

04:02.985 --> 04:03.946
[Moira] Janine?

04:04.363 --> 04:05.574
Hey, June. June.

04:05.658 --> 04:07.119
June! You're bleeding!

04:07.704 --> 04:09.498
You... You need to go
to the hospital.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.920
She may have gotten hurt.
We have to find her.

04:12.421 --> 04:14.007
‐Janine!
‐No, June. You're hurt.

04:14.091 --> 04:15.385
‐You need help.
‐Janine!

04:15.468 --> 04:17.765
No. Hey, hey.
Listen, listen, listen.

04:17.849 --> 04:19.268
‐You need to... Listen, Janine‐‐
‐Janine!

04:19.351 --> 04:20.980
‐June? June, June, June...
‐We have to find her.

04:21.063 --> 04:22.650
Just wait, okay? Listen, listen!

04:22.734 --> 04:23.569
‐Janine!
‐Hey, hey.

04:23.652 --> 04:26.282
I think I know where she is.
I think I know where she is.

04:26.575 --> 04:28.871
If she's hurt, she's gonna be
in the medical tent.

04:28.954 --> 04:30.165
‐Okay.
‐Okay?

04:30.248 --> 04:31.960
‐And it's that way.
‐Okay.

04:32.377 --> 04:33.547
‐Okay?
‐Okay.

04:33.630 --> 04:35.300
‐Let's go.
‐We have to find her.

04:35.383 --> 04:37.805
We will. We will.

04:38.347 --> 04:41.605
And maybe when we get there,
you can get checked out too.

04:41.688 --> 04:43.066
‐Will that be all right?
‐Yeah.

04:43.776 --> 04:45.236
Okay, well, let's go get her.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.199
‐We have to find her.
‐Let's go find her.

04:47.282 --> 04:48.493
[woman crying]

04:48.577 --> 04:50.080
Okay, we got to go that way.

04:50.371 --> 04:51.499
[man screaming in pain]

04:52.417 --> 04:54.088
[car alarms blaring]

05:16.925 --> 05:19.138
[Pierre] Ladies, we'll be
back in about two minutes, okay?

05:19.221 --> 05:20.599
Hang tight, two more minutes.

05:21.768 --> 05:22.645
All right.

05:22.728 --> 05:24.189
Who else haven't I seen?

05:24.816 --> 05:26.987
Hey, can you take a look
at my friend?

05:27.070 --> 05:28.281
‐[squealing in pain]
‐Please?

05:28.364 --> 05:29.408
Okay.

05:31.203 --> 05:32.665
Look at me, please.

05:33.332 --> 05:34.502
In the eyes.

05:36.213 --> 05:37.340
Good.

05:38.217 --> 05:39.428
Did you black out?

05:40.430 --> 05:41.725
Did you throw up?

05:42.058 --> 05:43.060
What?

05:43.687 --> 05:44.689
[groaning in pain]

05:46.860 --> 05:48.572
[Pierre] Sir, please,
try not to move.

05:49.657 --> 05:50.701
Hey, hey!

05:51.410 --> 05:52.538
Is she going to be okay?

05:52.622 --> 05:53.874
[Pierre] She's likely concussed,

05:53.957 --> 05:55.460
whether it's a mild
or severe TBI,

05:55.544 --> 05:57.464
I'll only know
when we get back to the tents.

05:57.548 --> 05:59.218
‐[man groaning]
‐Let me take a look at that.

06:00.386 --> 06:02.390
We'll take you somewhere
where you can get some help.

06:02.474 --> 06:03.476
Okay?

06:04.812 --> 06:06.148
And you're gonna be okay.

06:07.192 --> 06:08.779
‐Okay?
‐Moira?

06:12.327 --> 06:13.580
[voice shaking] Hi.

06:14.456 --> 06:15.291
Hi.

06:17.254 --> 06:20.134
Hi. Hi. Hi.

06:21.972 --> 06:23.099
It's me.

06:25.103 --> 06:26.105
No.

06:27.148 --> 06:29.027
‐No.
‐What?

06:29.904 --> 06:32.325
No, no, no, no.
Why are you here?

06:32.409 --> 06:34.204
No, hey, hey, hey.
Shh. I came back.

06:34.288 --> 06:36.626
‐What are you doing here? Why?
‐I came back for you.

06:36.710 --> 06:38.379
‐It's not safe.
‐I came back to help you,

06:38.462 --> 06:40.676
‐and I fucking found you.
‐It's not safe, Moira.

06:40.759 --> 06:43.306
‐You shouldn't be here.
‐I fucking found you.

06:43.389 --> 06:45.728
‐What are you say‐‐
‐I fucking found you.

06:45.811 --> 06:47.355
You're so crazy.

06:52.198 --> 06:53.451
You shouldn't be here.

06:53.535 --> 06:55.496
Now that I've found you,
I'm gonna take care of you.

06:55.581 --> 06:56.708
I got you.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.503
I got you.

07:02.010 --> 07:03.304
[sighs in relief]

07:13.365 --> 07:14.660
[people clamoring]

07:14.786 --> 07:17.373
[Oona announcing indistinctly
over PA system]

07:22.217 --> 07:23.804
[man] Come on, come on.

07:23.887 --> 07:26.433
[Oona] This area is not secure!

07:27.185 --> 07:31.443
The aid center has been closed
for your own safety!

07:31.528 --> 07:34.407
Please leave the premises
immediately!

07:36.370 --> 07:37.581
Do you see Janine?

07:37.665 --> 07:39.836
Hey, I'm gonna go look for her.

07:39.919 --> 07:41.756
[jet engine roaring]

07:47.433 --> 07:49.104
[indistinct shouting]

07:50.189 --> 07:51.526
Can't we just leave everything
for them?

07:51.609 --> 07:53.362
No, they'll kill each other
for their supplies.

07:53.445 --> 07:55.491
Oona! What's going on?

07:55.576 --> 07:56.578
Why are we leaving?

07:56.661 --> 07:58.122
Word is, they're gonna
start bombing again.

07:58.205 --> 07:59.625
Pack up. We gotta go now.

07:59.709 --> 08:00.669
I found June.

08:01.588 --> 08:02.590
She's here.

08:03.633 --> 08:04.635
Oh, my God.

08:05.971 --> 08:07.725
‐That's amazing.
‐Yeah, so I‐‐ Hey.

08:07.850 --> 08:09.604
Look, I know what the rules say.

08:09.687 --> 08:11.148
Moira, it's great to know
she's okay.

08:11.231 --> 08:12.400
She saved all those kids...

08:12.483 --> 08:14.655
When we get back, we can work
on trying to get her out.

08:14.739 --> 08:17.243
No! No, fuck that!

08:17.327 --> 08:19.582
‐I don't have time for this.
‐Oona, she's hurt.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.460
She's not gonna last
a week here.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.506
‐Look, I get that this is hard.
‐No, it's not hard.

08:23.590 --> 08:24.550
It's life or death.

08:24.634 --> 08:27.180
For everyone, not just you,
and not just her.

08:28.182 --> 08:29.685
She's my best friend, Oona.

08:29.769 --> 08:31.146
Gilead finds out we took her,

08:31.230 --> 08:34.069
no more missions, no more food,
no more medicine, nothing,

08:34.152 --> 08:35.614
for any of these people.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.870
You think June is more important
than every one of them?

08:40.874 --> 08:42.418
[alarm blaring]

08:42.503 --> 08:43.505
I'm sorry.

We got to go. Come with me.

‐[man 1] Hey, hey, hey!
‐Don't go.

‐My kids are starving. Please!
‐[man 2 speaking Spanish]

09:14.399 --> 09:15.234
[in English] I'm sorry.

You're just gonna leave us here?

09:16.445 --> 09:18.365

with us, but we'll be back.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.371
‐[shouting indistinctly]
‐[man 4] No! You're killing us!

[continues shouting
indistinctly]

09:30.932 --> 09:31.976
‐[exhales]
‐Good.

09:32.060 --> 09:33.187
You did good.

09:33.479 --> 09:35.316
You did good. Okay.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.445
Now you gotta get ready
to run to the boat.

09:37.529 --> 09:38.948
‐[ship horn honking]
‐Okay?

09:39.407 --> 09:41.704
‐What?
‐I'm gonna get you out of here.

09:41.788 --> 09:43.541
All right? You ready?

09:44.167 --> 09:45.044
‐No.
‐June.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.465
‐No, we have to find Janine.
‐Okay, hey‐‐ What? Hey.

09:47.549 --> 09:49.302
For fuck's sake,
we're not gonna find Janine!

09:49.386 --> 09:50.514
She's probably dead.

09:51.181 --> 09:53.227
And if you stay here,
you're gonna die too.

09:54.980 --> 09:56.859
June. Boat!

09:57.151 --> 09:58.362
‐Now!
‐Moira, no!

09:58.445 --> 09:59.322
‐No‐‐ [straining]
‐No!

09:59.406 --> 10:01.034
Don't make me leave you again!

10:01.911 --> 10:03.832
Don't fucking do that to me.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.420
You can't do that to me!

10:06.963 --> 10:10.136
Please!
You've got to go with me.

10:10.721 --> 10:12.265
You've got to come back.

10:12.348 --> 10:13.893
[clamoring]

10:17.400 --> 10:19.404
You can't make me leave
without Hannah.

10:19.780 --> 10:20.782
Hannah?

10:20.866 --> 10:22.870
You can't make me leave
without her, Moira.

10:22.953 --> 10:23.872
Where is she?

10:23.955 --> 10:25.834
You can't make me leave
without her.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.086
I don't know.

10:27.170 --> 10:28.338
‐Hannah?
‐I don't know,

10:28.422 --> 10:31.052
‐but I have to get back to her.
‐You don't know?

10:31.763 --> 10:34.017
What... What do you mean
you don't know?

10:34.100 --> 10:36.814
How are you gonna
get to her? Huh?

10:37.273 --> 10:38.317
Look at you!

10:38.860 --> 10:39.945
You're fucking beat to shit,

10:40.029 --> 10:41.657
you don't even know
where she is.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.285
How are you going to find her?

10:43.368 --> 10:45.498
They took her because of me.

10:46.291 --> 10:47.961
She was so scared.

10:49.005 --> 10:50.341
She was so scared.

10:52.470 --> 10:54.307
Then she's safer without you.

10:57.648 --> 10:58.900
They're gonna kill you.

11:02.073 --> 11:03.535
They're gonna hunt you down

11:03.618 --> 11:05.120
and they're gonna kill you.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.837
And they'll kill you
in front of her.

11:12.803 --> 11:14.055
Do you want to help her?

11:14.138 --> 11:17.270
You leave her the hell behind,
and you come with me.

11:18.105 --> 11:21.111
You wanna fight them?
You fight them from Canada.

11:21.612 --> 11:22.865
We will help you.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.411
The Canadians will help you!
The American government,

11:25.494 --> 11:28.626
whatever fucking left of it
is in Canada, and will help you.

11:31.507 --> 11:32.926
I'll be there.

11:34.053 --> 11:37.476
Luke, Emily, Rita...

11:37.978 --> 11:41.151
everyone who loves you is there.

11:43.573 --> 11:44.700
Nichole.

11:45.744 --> 11:47.163
Nichole is there.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.500
‐[sniffles]
‐Is she okay?

11:50.002 --> 11:52.381
Yes, she... She needs you.

11:52.465 --> 11:54.845
She needs you, she's growing up
and she's amazing

11:54.929 --> 11:57.433
but she needs you
because you're her mother.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.270
You're her mother, okay?

11:59.605 --> 12:02.527
Come on, June. Come on!

12:03.236 --> 12:05.240
[clamoring continues]

12:07.411 --> 12:10.167
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

12:10.292 --> 12:12.631
You'll come back for her,
all right?

12:12.714 --> 12:14.217
Let's go, let's go! Hurry!

12:14.300 --> 12:15.845
‐Come on! Hurry up!
‐Go, go, go!

12:15.929 --> 12:17.557
[clamoring continues]

12:19.352 --> 12:20.270
You'll come back for Nichole.

12:20.354 --> 12:22.024
Come back
for your baby daughter.

12:26.449 --> 12:27.451
Okay.

12:28.036 --> 12:29.873
‐Okay. Okay.
‐[ship horn blaring]

12:29.999 --> 12:32.420
All right, come on. Come on.

12:33.548 --> 12:35.552
[clamoring continues]

12:40.895 --> 12:42.941
[ship horn blaring]

12:46.949 --> 12:49.037
Stay here. Don't move.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.372
[door closes]

13:20.265 --> 13:21.852
[jet passing by]

13:22.854 --> 13:24.525
[breathing unsteadily]

13:25.192 --> 13:27.446
[people screaming]

13:35.420 --> 13:38.093
You know, technically,
that couch is also mine.

13:38.176 --> 13:40.515
Technically,
this couch is Lisa's,

13:41.266 --> 13:42.476
and you were supposed
to watch it

13:42.561 --> 13:44.438
while she went to go
study abroad.

13:44.982 --> 13:48.363
Well, I will leave it to you
out of the kindness of my heart.

13:49.533 --> 13:50.743
Luke hates it.

13:50.827 --> 13:52.413
Luke hates it.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.166
[chuckles]

13:58.133 --> 13:59.803
It's not gonna be
that different, you know?

13:59.887 --> 14:01.765
I mean, I'm gonna see you
all the time.

14:03.603 --> 14:06.107
It's not really gonna
change that much.

14:06.775 --> 14:09.573
My mother made me promise
I would keep my own last name.

14:09.656 --> 14:10.867
Oh, phew.

14:15.042 --> 14:16.837
Do you really think
this is a good idea?

14:17.379 --> 14:18.633
Which part?

14:19.885 --> 14:20.929
All of them.

14:22.348 --> 14:23.350
All the parts.

14:25.688 --> 14:26.857
[sighs]

14:27.651 --> 14:29.905
[refrigerator door opens,
closes]

14:33.119 --> 14:36.585
Wait, so you think
marrying Luke is a bad idea?

14:38.046 --> 14:40.635
Look, I just, um,
think it would be a lot easier

14:40.718 --> 14:42.555
to end an engagement
than a marriage.

14:43.891 --> 14:44.935
And you know this how,

14:45.018 --> 14:46.897
because of all the marriages
you've ended?

14:49.402 --> 14:50.571
Never mind.

14:52.408 --> 14:54.078
No. No, no, no.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.330
No, I'm curious.

14:55.414 --> 14:57.752
Tell me exactly why you think
I shouldn't marry

14:57.836 --> 15:01.217
a kind, smart, loving man

15:01.300 --> 15:04.516
who has a good job
and nice shoulders.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.645
Because he cheats on his wives

15:06.729 --> 15:09.233
and he leaves them
when they can't reproduce.

15:09.860 --> 15:11.029
Oh! Wife.

15:11.112 --> 15:13.659
One prior wife.
And I'm not Annie.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.621
Not yet.

15:27.687 --> 15:30.860
Our marriage is not going
to be like that marriage.

15:31.570 --> 15:34.325
They fought all the time
about all kinds of stuff.

15:35.410 --> 15:36.663
We never fight.

15:47.226 --> 15:48.478
[Moira] That's my pitcher.

15:52.654 --> 15:53.906
Fine, take it.

15:54.825 --> 15:55.910
I don't want it.

16:10.438 --> 16:11.608
[Oona] Hey.

16:12.276 --> 16:13.236
Hi.

16:13.319 --> 16:14.573
How are you holding up?

16:15.031 --> 16:16.535
Seeing all that up close.

16:17.537 --> 16:19.624
I've seen suffering
up close before.

16:20.668 --> 16:23.632
The hardest part is when
you're the one with the power.

16:25.343 --> 16:27.306
I'm so sorry
we couldn't bring her.

16:28.851 --> 16:29.811
Yeah.

16:34.195 --> 16:35.990
Look, we're nearly home.

16:36.407 --> 16:38.369
After his port inspection,

16:38.453 --> 16:41.627
it's only about [chuckles]
ten more hours to Canada.

16:41.710 --> 16:42.837
Port inspection?

16:44.925 --> 16:47.095
Before we leave their waters,
they're gonna come aboard,

16:47.179 --> 16:49.141
they're gonna check the boats
stem to stern.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.310
Oh.

16:50.645 --> 16:52.231
It shouldn't be that bad.

16:53.316 --> 16:55.445
I mean, once
at this checkpoint in Aleppo,

16:55.529 --> 16:56.698
‐we had‐‐
‐Oona.

17:00.163 --> 17:01.625
I need to tell you something.

17:15.569 --> 17:17.281
[Oona]
They're gonna be here soon.

17:18.659 --> 17:22.082
I have the utmost respect
for June Osborn.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.840
She pioneered Angels' Flight.
She's a hero.

17:26.633 --> 17:29.013
But we're in
a really bad situation,

17:29.556 --> 17:30.850
which sees our NGO

17:30.933 --> 17:33.271
and all of our future missions
put at risk.

17:33.354 --> 17:34.315
Now, I'm the team leader,

17:34.398 --> 17:36.653
so what happens next
is my responsibility,

17:36.778 --> 17:38.281
but I want to hear
from all of you.

17:38.364 --> 17:39.784
It's my fault.

17:41.287 --> 17:42.624
I'm the one
that forced June to come.

17:42.707 --> 17:43.667
She didn't even want to.

17:44.043 --> 17:45.963
So it's me we should be talking
about right now, not her.

17:46.047 --> 17:48.092
[Oona] You're right, Moira.
It is your fault.

17:48.802 --> 17:50.472
And I know you love your friend,

17:50.556 --> 17:52.518
but we all have people we love
in Gilead.

17:54.981 --> 17:56.275
I think we should turn her in.

17:56.359 --> 17:57.612
‐What?
‐[Oona] Let him finish.

17:57.695 --> 17:59.448
‐Say more about that.
‐[Pierre] If they find her,

17:59.532 --> 18:01.578
all of our future work
is fucked forever.

18:01.662 --> 18:02.705
We can't let that happen.

18:02.789 --> 18:04.291
She's Public Enemy Number One
in Gilead.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.878
Which means they'll be
even angrier we took her.

18:05.961 --> 18:06.880
[Oona] It's true.

18:06.963 --> 18:09.218
If they find her, they won't
let us back into Chicago,

18:09.301 --> 18:10.136
they won't let anyone in,

18:10.220 --> 18:11.973
and that will affect
all the people there.

18:12.600 --> 18:13.977
I think we should keep her.

18:14.562 --> 18:16.858
I know she broke the rules,
but she's here now,

18:16.942 --> 18:18.529
and if we turn her in,
they'll kill her.

18:18.612 --> 18:19.864
[Chris] I think
we should turn her in.

18:19.948 --> 18:21.117
Okay. Jesus.

18:21.409 --> 18:22.578
There's got to be
another option here.

18:22.662 --> 18:25.208
I mean, we can't just turn
someone in to certain death.

18:25.291 --> 18:27.087
This is supposed to be
a humanitarian mission.

18:27.170 --> 18:29.133
Humanitarian missions
are about people.

18:29.216 --> 18:30.218
Not one person.

18:30.301 --> 18:32.765
There has to be somewhere
we can put her.

18:33.391 --> 18:36.063
I mean, we can hide her
in the floor or, uh...

18:36.480 --> 18:38.067
we can put her in one
of the lifeboats on the side.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.361
‐They'll search those.
‐How do you know?

18:39.445 --> 18:41.700
You ever escape Gilead before?
Then shut the fuck up!

18:41.783 --> 18:44.789
Children will be hurt by this.
Children who did nothing wrong.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.333
[Oona] Not just the children,
their parents‐‐

18:46.417 --> 18:47.628
[Moira] I get it.
I'm just saying

18:47.712 --> 18:48.964
there has to be another way.

18:49.047 --> 18:50.175
[Oona] What other way is there

18:50.258 --> 18:52.345
that doesn't put
the entire crew on risk?

18:53.055 --> 18:54.266
[Moira] Make her look like
one of the crews.

18:54.349 --> 18:55.686
[Elena] No, that's not
what I'm saying.

18:55.770 --> 18:57.189
[Moira] One person
who's sitting right there!

18:57.272 --> 18:58.441
Just turn me in.

19:02.784 --> 19:04.621
Jesus! Don't listen to her.

19:07.752 --> 19:10.256
My life isn't worth
more than anyone else's.

19:19.066 --> 19:20.861
[ship horn blaring]

19:22.405 --> 19:23.992
[siren wailing]

19:25.538 --> 19:27.542
I'll tell them
I got on the boat myself.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.421
No one helped me.

19:34.304 --> 19:35.516
Thank you.

19:37.562 --> 19:38.814
[Moira] No, no!

19:38.939 --> 19:40.651
‐[Oona] Okay, everyone on deck.
‐June!

19:40.734 --> 19:42.905
‐[Oona] Let's get through this.
‐You can't do this, June.

19:45.034 --> 19:46.203
That's it?

19:46.287 --> 19:47.414
After everything
you've been through,

19:47.497 --> 19:49.544
after every battle you fought,
you've just given up?

19:51.088 --> 19:52.215
Look at me!

19:56.725 --> 19:58.227
[sirens approaching]

20:29.874 --> 20:30.960
Please?

20:34.216 --> 20:35.259
Oona.

20:37.640 --> 20:38.934
Elena, print her an ID.

20:43.484 --> 20:44.988
Clean her up, get her a vest.

20:45.071 --> 20:46.866
Make sure
she doesn't fuck this up.

20:48.829 --> 20:49.831
Thank you.

20:50.081 --> 20:51.083
[siren chirps]

20:55.216 --> 20:56.176
Come on.

21:00.894 --> 21:01.896
[siren chirps]

21:03.817 --> 21:05.278
[soldier 1 on radio]
Found any contraband?

21:05.904 --> 21:07.198
[soldier 2]
Narcotics in evidence

21:07.282 --> 21:09.286
but likely classified
as medical supplies.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.581
[indistinct chatter over radio]

21:12.668 --> 21:14.756
[soldier 1] Let's clear the boat
as quick as possible.

21:14.839 --> 21:16.968
[soldier 2]
The boat is 70% searched.

21:17.052 --> 21:19.682
ETA 20, 25 minutes.

21:19.766 --> 21:20.601
[soldier 3] Name?

21:20.684 --> 21:21.853
Elena Choi.

21:41.141 --> 21:42.018
Next.

21:51.704 --> 21:52.540
[soldier 3] Name?

21:52.623 --> 21:53.959
Moira Strand.

21:54.710 --> 21:55.546
Where are you from?

21:55.963 --> 21:57.465
Toronto. Born and bred.

21:59.219 --> 22:00.221
[soldier 3] Next.

22:12.328 --> 22:13.414
Name?

22:20.052 --> 22:21.013
Name.

22:21.931 --> 22:22.933
Rachel Smith.

22:27.776 --> 22:29.362
[soldier 3]
Something happen to you?

22:30.323 --> 22:31.659
[soldier 4 over radio]
Private Tennyson,

22:32.368 --> 22:33.454
are we all clear?

22:33.997 --> 22:34.957
Sir?

22:35.082 --> 22:38.005
I repeat, are we all clear?

22:38.632 --> 22:39.884
[soldier 3] Not quite yet, sir.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.727
What happened to you?

22:57.001 --> 22:58.505
She got knocked
to the ground in...

22:58.588 --> 22:59.966
In all that chaos back there.

23:00.424 --> 23:01.803
She hit her head pretty hard.

23:02.303 --> 23:04.391
Man, it was crazy.
Did you see those bombs hit?

23:05.351 --> 23:06.813
Lucky you were safe out here.

23:07.355 --> 23:09.777
Unless you got family and stuff
back in Chicago.

23:09.860 --> 23:11.446
Um, really hope they're okay.

23:16.833 --> 23:17.960
All right. Next.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.797
Let's get the hell out of here.

23:54.658 --> 23:55.827
You made it.

23:59.125 --> 24:00.294
We're goin' to Canada.

24:23.508 --> 24:25.929
Ooh, beautiful and strong.

24:26.639 --> 24:29.144
Must be your, uh,
Swedish lineage, just...

24:33.945 --> 24:37.285
[June] Just so you know,
I'm never moving again. Ever.

24:37.368 --> 24:39.623
Deal. I'll put it in the vows.

24:40.291 --> 24:43.213
Oh, yeah. We should definitely
put it in the vows.

24:46.554 --> 24:48.348
Did you and Annie
write your own vows?

24:49.350 --> 24:51.939
Oh. No. It was not
that kind of wedding.

24:52.649 --> 24:55.279
Oh. What kind of wedding was it?

24:55.362 --> 24:57.576
Uh, just a normal...

24:58.160 --> 24:59.037
Yeah.

25:00.582 --> 25:01.542
Like at a church?

25:02.335 --> 25:03.505
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

25:03.588 --> 25:05.634
That kind of thing
was important to her.

25:05.717 --> 25:06.719
Oh.

25:08.515 --> 25:11.019
So "for richer or poorer,
sickness and health,

25:11.102 --> 25:13.273
better or worse,"
like all that kind of thing?

25:14.108 --> 25:15.277
Babe?

25:15.361 --> 25:16.572
Yeah?

25:16.656 --> 25:17.616
What's going on?

25:17.699 --> 25:18.743
Nothing.

25:18.826 --> 25:19.828
No?

25:21.373 --> 25:24.254
'Cause, you know, that marriage
is not gonna be our marriage.

25:24.337 --> 25:25.507
Yeah, I know.

25:26.174 --> 25:27.719
Can you be careful
with that, please?

25:29.180 --> 25:30.432
That's fine.

25:31.727 --> 25:32.896
What's in it?

25:36.361 --> 25:38.490
It's a cocktail pitcher, okay?

25:40.035 --> 25:41.204
That I stole.

25:42.498 --> 25:43.626
What is your problem?

25:43.710 --> 25:45.129
[giggles] Don't you dare.

25:51.559 --> 25:54.022
I don't know.
What if I can't get pregnant?

25:55.609 --> 25:56.611
What?

25:57.153 --> 25:59.407
You and Annie had a hard time
having kids.

25:59.490 --> 26:00.367
[hesitates]

26:00.451 --> 26:01.579
What if that happens to us?

26:03.290 --> 26:05.712
You are not Annie, okay?

26:05.795 --> 26:08.885
And I'm a very different person
than I was back then.

26:09.637 --> 26:10.513
Yeah.

26:11.264 --> 26:13.477
But, I mean, you don't know
what's gonna happen, right?

26:15.230 --> 26:16.901
What if I end up
disappointing you?

26:17.485 --> 26:19.782
Go... Come on! Come here.

26:21.744 --> 26:25.627
Look, I don't know if we're
gonna be able to have kids,

26:26.671 --> 26:29.425
but either way
we're gonna be okay.

26:30.010 --> 26:31.388
You really want kids, though.

26:31.471 --> 26:33.225
Yeah, and I really want you.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.062
Like...

26:37.233 --> 26:38.945
You're not gonna disappoint me.

26:39.362 --> 26:42.410
Well, I mean,
you don't know that.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.205
Well...

26:45.542 --> 26:48.965
Everyone has a line, you know,
something that's unforgivable.

26:52.556 --> 26:54.100
What if I'm not
who you think I am?

26:59.360 --> 27:01.574
Then I'll just love
whoever you turn out to be.

27:42.906 --> 27:44.116
[Oona] You snuck her in
behind my back

27:44.200 --> 27:45.035
and you lied to me!

27:45.118 --> 27:47.624
I mean, what did you think
was gonna happen?

27:47.707 --> 27:49.670
[Moira] But you're the one
who decided to save her.

27:49.753 --> 27:51.047
[Oona] Because you put me
in a position

27:51.130 --> 27:53.761
where I had to either save her
or kill her.

27:53.844 --> 27:55.932
Well, you couldn't have
expected me to leave her behind.

27:56.015 --> 27:58.228
You don't think I've ever
had to leave anyone behind?

27:58.896 --> 28:02.278
Every mission, you don't think
I've had to make hard choices?

28:02.361 --> 28:03.948
Choices that keep me
up at night,

28:04.031 --> 28:05.660
that I regret every single day!

28:05.743 --> 28:06.745
I'm sorry.

28:08.666 --> 28:10.878
I wish this didn't
have to be about us.

28:12.464 --> 28:15.053
Let's not make this last longer
than it has to.

28:17.559 --> 28:19.771
But we can still talk
at the office?

28:21.650 --> 28:23.738
There's not gonna be
an office after this.

28:32.505 --> 28:33.465
[softly] Fuck.

29:00.060 --> 29:01.062
[door opens]

29:02.231 --> 29:03.233
[door closes]

29:08.661 --> 29:09.830
What the hell?

29:10.623 --> 29:12.334
Hey, are you trying
to take this lifeboat?

29:12.418 --> 29:13.629
Can you help me?

29:13.838 --> 29:14.840
No!

29:14.923 --> 29:17.136
Fuck you! I'm not helping you.
Where the hell do you think

29:17.261 --> 29:19.473
you're gonna go on a lifeboat
in the middle of the night?

29:19.558 --> 29:20.768
I have to go back.

29:20.852 --> 29:22.479
Are you fucking insane?

29:22.564 --> 29:24.150
‐I have to get her.
‐Stop it!

29:25.528 --> 29:28.241
You're gonna die in the water
or you'll sail back to Gilead

29:28.366 --> 29:29.536
and die there!

29:29.911 --> 29:30.913
That's your plan?

29:36.132 --> 29:37.050
Fine.

29:37.927 --> 29:41.142
You wanna go back,
I'm going with you.

29:42.311 --> 29:43.981
We'll die together.

29:44.064 --> 29:45.442
‐Stop it.
‐No.

29:45.526 --> 29:47.154
‐Yes.
‐No!

29:47.237 --> 29:50.536
I did not bring you all this way
just to leave you behind.

29:50.620 --> 29:52.707
I told you
I needed to stay for Hannah,

29:52.791 --> 29:54.418
and you manipulated me.

29:54.503 --> 29:56.380
I didn't manipulate you.
I saved your life.

29:56.464 --> 29:58.719
You tricked me
into leaving my daughter!

30:01.224 --> 30:02.351
I'm sorry.

30:02.476 --> 30:04.230
If I don't go back now,

30:04.313 --> 30:05.942
she is gone forever!

30:06.735 --> 30:08.739
Hannah is gone forever.

30:16.420 --> 30:17.507
What happened?

30:18.258 --> 30:19.385
[sobbing]

30:19.468 --> 30:20.638
With Hannah.

30:21.765 --> 30:23.769
You said they took her.
What happened?

30:28.612 --> 30:31.660
I'm not gonna force you to stay.
I just wanna know.

30:33.706 --> 30:35.208
They showed her to me.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.549
I saw her.

30:41.555 --> 30:43.893
But there was nothing
I could do. For her.

30:44.728 --> 30:46.982
There was nothing
I could do to help her.

30:50.488 --> 30:52.284
She didn't recognize me.

30:55.206 --> 30:56.793
She didn't know who I was.

30:59.883 --> 31:01.135
She was scared of me.

31:01.595 --> 31:02.722
Oh, God.

31:03.849 --> 31:06.563
Everything that has
happened to her,

31:07.732 --> 31:09.276
it's because of me.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.403
No.

31:10.780 --> 31:12.240
No, that is not true.

31:12.324 --> 31:13.827
How can I go back without her?

31:14.370 --> 31:16.917
‐No one‐‐
‐How can I show up without her?

31:18.294 --> 31:20.508
June, no one expects you
to have her.

31:21.635 --> 31:24.516
They're waiting for a person,
not a superhero.

31:24.849 --> 31:26.561
Even if you did get
all those kids out.

31:26.645 --> 31:27.772
But not her.

31:30.402 --> 31:31.822
Not my Hannah.

31:33.784 --> 31:35.328
I didn't have her.

31:37.542 --> 31:40.005
I tried. I really did.

31:40.798 --> 31:44.430
I did everything I could,
but it wasn't enough.

31:50.483 --> 31:52.530
I was supposed to save her.

31:55.201 --> 31:56.663
'Cause I'm her mommy.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.588
I'm her mother.

32:03.761 --> 32:06.641
It is my job to protect her.

32:09.354 --> 32:10.608
And I failed.

32:15.033 --> 32:16.620
How can I face him?

32:18.957 --> 32:21.128
How can I tell him
that everything

32:21.212 --> 32:23.592
that has happened to her
is because of me?

32:23.675 --> 32:25.386
No. That's not true.

32:25.470 --> 32:27.850
And that's Gilead talking.
You know that's not true.

32:27.934 --> 32:30.438
No, he is never gonna
forgive me.

32:31.065 --> 32:32.317
He's never gonna forgive me.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.446
All these years,
he has waited for you.

32:35.950 --> 32:38.121
And he has never
given up on you.

32:38.664 --> 32:40.584
You need to have
a little faith now too.

32:40.668 --> 32:42.045
I know him.

32:43.256 --> 32:45.260
I know him.
I know what he can take.

32:47.347 --> 32:48.809
How 'bout you find out?

32:56.198 --> 32:57.200
Yeah.

32:58.327 --> 33:00.081
‐Come here.
‐[June sobbing]

33:27.093 --> 33:28.387
Hey, Junebug.

33:31.227 --> 33:32.312
Hey.

33:33.356 --> 33:34.441
[exhales]

33:34.859 --> 33:35.861
There's a baby.

33:37.907 --> 33:39.076
Well, it's, uh...

33:39.493 --> 33:41.330
I'm pregnant!
We're having a baby.

33:41.413 --> 33:44.002
And I was gonna tell you inside,

33:44.086 --> 33:45.547
and I put
all these candles out, but...

33:45.631 --> 33:47.384
[both laughing]

33:49.346 --> 33:52.102
We're having a baby!
We're having a baby?

33:52.185 --> 33:54.649
‐Yeah!
‐Hey! We're having a you!

33:55.191 --> 33:56.653
And we're gonna
love you so much.

33:56.736 --> 33:59.116
‐[laughing]
‐We're having a baby!

33:59.199 --> 34:00.995
‐Shh!
‐We're having a baby!

34:01.078 --> 34:01.913
[horn honks]

34:03.374 --> 34:04.334
I...

34:05.461 --> 34:06.589
I love you so much.

34:06.673 --> 34:07.842
I love you, too.

34:08.635 --> 34:09.762
[screaming indistinctly]

34:10.471 --> 34:11.390
[June laughing]

34:19.281 --> 34:20.283
[Hannah laughing]

34:22.495 --> 34:24.041
Some more artistic ones, please.

34:26.420 --> 34:27.590
[inaudible]

34:31.263 --> 34:32.349
Yeah.

34:33.309 --> 34:34.269
[June] I think that's fine.

34:34.353 --> 34:36.231
Ooh! Look at that method!

34:39.363 --> 34:40.365
[door opens]

34:42.745 --> 34:43.747
[door closes]

34:53.558 --> 34:54.476
You okay?

34:55.144 --> 34:56.146
Mmm‐hmm.

34:56.689 --> 34:58.192
[footsteps approaching]

35:15.978 --> 35:17.773
You know, we can stay here
as long as you want.

35:22.616 --> 35:23.618
I'm okay.

35:26.583 --> 35:27.877
I just need a minute.

35:29.254 --> 35:30.173
Okay.

35:34.974 --> 35:36.143
I'm okay.

35:38.272 --> 35:39.274
[door opens]

35:40.819 --> 35:41.905
[door closes]

35:43.199 --> 35:45.203
[breathing unsteadily]

35:58.730 --> 35:59.899
[exhales]

36:09.042 --> 36:10.419
[Luke] Where... Where is she?

36:10.504 --> 36:12.131
[footsteps approaching]

36:12.215 --> 36:13.384
[breathing unsteadily]

36:27.120 --> 36:29.542
[breathes deeply]

36:31.378 --> 36:32.631
[breathing unsteadily]

36:55.552 --> 36:57.347
I'm sorry I don't have her.

37:01.313 --> 37:02.315
'Kay?

37:04.027 --> 37:05.196
I'm sorry.

37:09.371 --> 37:11.041
[sobbing] I'm sorry
it's just me.

37:11.793 --> 37:13.755
I'm sorry it's just me.

37:13.838 --> 37:15.049
‐I knew it would...
‐No, no, no, no.

37:15.132 --> 37:16.218
‐I'm sorry.
‐No, no, no, no.

37:17.513 --> 37:19.517
‐I'm sorry.
‐Mmm‐mmm.

37:19.600 --> 37:20.769
I'm so sorry.

37:20.852 --> 37:22.021
[murmurs indistinctly]

37:24.067 --> 37:25.529
[sobbing]

37:25.612 --> 37:27.407
‐I'm sorry.
‐[exhales]

37:31.415 --> 37:32.543
You're okay.

38:50.740 --> 38:51.742
[inhales deeply]
