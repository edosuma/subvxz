WEBVTT

00:03.969 --> 00:07.628
For as long as I can remember, it's
been my dream to be out on that court.

00:07.629 --> 00:11.365
There's nothing better than being in
front of the fans, everyone screaming.

00:11.366 --> 00:16.288
I mean, what little boy doesn't want
to grow up to be a cheerleader?

00:16.289 --> 00:18.573
I can think of one.

00:18.574 --> 00:22.114
I think it's great you're trying out
for the cheer leading squad, Dez.

00:22.115 --> 00:23.612
What are you guys doing?

00:23.613 --> 00:25.997
I'm interviewing Dez
for the school paper.

00:25.998 --> 00:28.661
We have a school paper?

00:28.662 --> 00:30.451
Of course we do.

00:30.452 --> 00:32.598
I'm doing an article
on school spirit week,

00:32.600 --> 00:35.837
and if they like it, they'll
make me a reporter.

00:35.838 --> 00:37.549
School spirit week?

00:37.550 --> 00:40.393
That's the lamest thing
I've ever heard.

00:40.394 --> 00:43.934
Yippee, school, rah rah rah.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.107
You know, they're giving
a thousand-dollar prize

00:46.108 --> 00:48.166
to the student who
shows the most spirit.

00:48.167 --> 00:50.738
Yippee! School! Rah rah rah!

00:50.739 --> 00:51.809
Go...

00:51.810 --> 00:53.970
Mustangs!

00:54.034 --> 00:56.157
We're the Manatees.

00:56.158 --> 00:57.512
Oh.

00:57.513 --> 00:58.637
Go...

00:58.638 --> 01:00.748
Manatees!

01:00.749 --> 01:03.518
This is great. We're
all getting into this.

01:03.519 --> 01:05.559
Go us!

01:07.301 --> 01:08.756
Okay.

01:08.757 --> 01:12.732
So... what are you doing for
school spirit week, Austin?

01:12.733 --> 01:17.016
I don't really do any school
stuff, unless you count homework.

01:17.017 --> 01:19.936
Actually, no, I don't
do any school stuff.

01:19.937 --> 01:21.769
Well, you are kinda busy.

01:21.770 --> 01:24.405
You do have a little thing
called a singing career.

01:24.406 --> 01:27.675
I know, but I should at least
be able to do one thing.

01:27.676 --> 01:32.313
Let's see. I like photography,
wood shop, lunch.

01:32.314 --> 01:38.214
I just wish there was something besides
music that I was really good at.

01:41.089 --> 01:42.490
What?

01:42.491 --> 01:45.225
You've gotta join the
basketball team.

01:45.226 --> 01:47.409
We have a basketball team?

01:47.410 --> 01:49.528
That's it! I'm gonna
play basketball!

01:49.529 --> 01:51.107
And I'm gonna cheer for you.

01:51.108 --> 01:52.949
Woo!

01:52.950 --> 01:57.160
- I'm gonna write about it all.
- And I'm gonna win $1,000.

01:57.161 --> 01:58.706
Go...

01:58.707 --> 02:01.827
- Manatees!
- Mustangs!

02:02.611 --> 02:05.311
I mean Manatees!

02:08.835 --> 02:11.937

03:03.098 --> 03:05.198
Attaboy.

03:05.652 --> 03:08.928
Austin Moon, the new starting
point guard for Marino High...

03:08.929 --> 03:11.219
Was impressive in
his first practice.

03:11.220 --> 03:12.592
Aw, thanks, Ally.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.265
Except for the three turnovers
and eight missed free throws.

03:15.266 --> 03:18.469
You know, you don't have
to report everything.

03:18.470 --> 03:21.272
So how does it feel
to be on the team?

03:21.273 --> 03:25.796
Great. When I'm out there, I'm
not Austin Moon, pop star.

03:25.797 --> 03:29.563
I'm Austin Moon,
one of the guys.

03:29.564 --> 03:33.284
Here's that autographed
ball you wanted, Jim.

03:33.285 --> 03:36.100
Guess who got a job as the
basketball team manager?

03:36.101 --> 03:39.690
I clean dirty uniforms and wipe
sweat off the court during games.

03:39.691 --> 03:42.886
- Sounds disgusting.
- It is!

03:42.887 --> 03:47.008
If that doesn't show them school
spirit, I don't know what does.

03:47.009 --> 03:51.449
Let's go, Manatees! I
need those towels.

03:53.772 --> 03:56.707
I love washing gross,
sweaty towels.

03:56.708 --> 03:58.508
Oh.

03:58.589 --> 04:01.829
Good times. Good times.

04:04.066 --> 04:07.919
School spirit has really
brought out the best in Trish.

04:07.920 --> 04:11.555
I give her a day
before she cracks.

04:11.556 --> 04:13.724
Hey, buddy. Good luck on
your cheer leading tryouts.

04:13.725 --> 04:15.492
Oh, I don't need luck.

04:15.493 --> 04:19.079
I've got a little thing
called "talent".

04:19.079 --> 04:23.534
That's what I call my good
luck charm... talent.

04:23.535 --> 04:26.698
All right, you cheer hopefuls.
It's time to line up.

04:26.699 --> 04:29.399
L-I-N-E U-P!

04:29.747 --> 04:31.542
- Hey, Austin.
- Hey, Kimmy.

04:31.543 --> 04:34.046
Just joined the basketball team.
Wanna hang out?

04:34.047 --> 04:37.575
You're cute, but no thanks.
I only date athletes.

04:37.576 --> 04:39.750
I said I just joined
the basketball team.

04:39.751 --> 04:42.353
Oh, I mean real athletes...

04:42.354 --> 04:44.754
Cheerleaders!

04:44.824 --> 04:47.044
Seriously?

04:47.459 --> 04:50.327
Hey, Kimmy. I'm here for
cheer leading tryouts.

04:50.328 --> 04:53.134
Do you want me to start with the
manatee cheer or a handspring?

04:53.135 --> 04:55.666
Not so fast, Red.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.647
Chuck.

04:57.769 --> 04:59.503
You're trying out too?

04:59.504 --> 05:02.539
I'm not wearing a track suit
and body glitter for nothing.

05:02.540 --> 05:04.508
You're not making The Squad.

05:04.509 --> 05:08.345
There's not enough glitter in the world
to make you a better cheerleader than me.

05:08.346 --> 05:12.130
First of all, I'm already a
better cheerleader than you.

05:12.131 --> 05:15.911
And second of all, there's more
than enough glitter in the world.

05:15.912 --> 05:17.447
I should know.

05:17.448 --> 05:20.913
My family's in the
glitter business.

05:20.914 --> 05:24.972
Good, then you'll have a job to fall
back on when you don't make The Squad.

05:24.973 --> 05:27.259
Easy, boys. I know
you're both tough.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.287
Oh, I am much
tougher than he is.

05:30.288 --> 05:34.471
I'm so tough, Navy Seals wanna
be me when they grow up.

05:34.472 --> 05:39.784
I'm so tough, when something bad
happens, people don't say, "tough luck".

05:39.785 --> 05:42.166
They say, "Chuck luck".

05:42.167 --> 05:46.949
I'm so tough, if I were a math
problem, I'd be impossible to solve.

05:46.950 --> 05:50.521
Okay, guys, let's channel all
that aggression into a cheer.

05:50.522 --> 05:53.522
Chuck, you go first.

05:56.918 --> 05:59.630
M-a-n-a-t-e-e!

05:59.631 --> 06:02.533
Marino High is the team to beat!

06:02.534 --> 06:03.759
Yay!

06:03.760 --> 06:05.920
Go! Woo!

06:10.408 --> 06:13.650
Is that all you've got?

06:13.651 --> 06:15.329
Ready? Okay!

06:15.330 --> 06:17.827
M-a-n-a-t-e-e!

06:17.828 --> 06:20.554
Marino High won't take defeat!

06:20.555 --> 06:22.715
Go team!

06:22.716 --> 06:24.576
Woo!

06:26.000 --> 06:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:35.399 --> 06:38.301
Guess who made cookies
for the basketball team.

06:38.302 --> 06:40.604
Ooh, and they're manatee shaped.

06:40.605 --> 06:43.440
- That's nice of you.
- I had no choice.

06:43.441 --> 06:46.054
Darcy Pivnick made cupcakes
for the football team.

06:46.055 --> 06:49.941
There's no way I'm gonna lose
to that goody two-shoes.

06:49.942 --> 06:52.822
That's the spirit.

06:54.486 --> 06:56.681
This tastes horrible.

06:56.682 --> 07:01.722
Yeah, I ran out of sugar,
so I just used sand.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.880
Dez made the cheer
leading squad!

07:03.881 --> 07:05.662
So did Chuck, but
I'm not worried.

07:05.663 --> 07:08.446
Because I'm gonna be Yell King.

07:08.447 --> 07:11.356
Yeah, you will, because
you're the best.

07:11.357 --> 07:13.907
Gimme a "B," gimme an "E"...

07:13.908 --> 07:15.405
Ally, please.

07:15.406 --> 07:19.201
Leave the cheer
leading to the pros.

07:19.202 --> 07:21.948
How cool is this? I'm
on the basketball team.

07:21.949 --> 07:23.480
You're writing for the paper.

07:23.481 --> 07:25.354
- Dez is a cheerleader.
- Woo!

07:25.355 --> 07:29.319
Trish is pretending to care
about school to win money.

07:29.320 --> 07:32.308
I came up with a surefire
way to win that money.

07:32.309 --> 07:35.942
To end spirit week, I've organized
a huge concert in the school gym.

07:35.943 --> 07:37.232
That's generous of you.

07:37.233 --> 07:39.983
Actually, it's generous of you.
You're the headliner.

07:39.984 --> 07:41.364
Oh.

07:41.365 --> 07:43.600
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Austin Moon.

07:43.601 --> 07:45.304
I came by to tell you
that I'm bringing the

07:45.305 --> 07:48.052
owner of the Miami Heat
to your school concert.

07:48.053 --> 07:50.427
- You know about that?
- Yeah, Trish told me.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.908
She sure has school spirit.

07:54.919 --> 07:57.193
I can't believe the owner
of The Heat's coming.

07:57.194 --> 07:59.009
I'm trying to get you
to perform at halftime

07:59.010 --> 08:01.751
during a Heat Game, so
you've gotta impress him.

08:01.752 --> 08:04.734
You should bring him by early to
see Austin's basketball game.

08:04.735 --> 08:07.091
Thanks, buddy. You think I'm
good enough to make The Heat?

08:07.092 --> 08:10.594
No. I want him to see me cheer.

08:10.595 --> 08:13.593
I could be a Heat cheerleader.
I've got skills.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.754
Go team!

08:17.268 --> 08:19.402
Congratulations on
making the team, Austin.

08:19.403 --> 08:21.404
- Thanks.
- Now quit.

08:21.405 --> 08:22.406
What?

08:22.407 --> 08:24.741
Austin, maybe I didn't make
this clear when I signed you.

08:24.742 --> 08:26.887
You're not just a singer.
You're a dancer, too.

08:26.888 --> 08:29.081
And I've got a lot of
money invested in you.

08:29.082 --> 08:31.615
I don't want you doing
anything that'll get you hurt.

08:31.616 --> 08:33.450
I never even thought about that.

08:33.451 --> 08:35.418
Is it okay if I
keep cheer leading?

08:35.419 --> 08:38.717
Maybe I wasn't clear to you either.
I don't care what you do.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.818
Oh, so you're cool
with me cheer leading?

08:40.820 --> 08:44.904
Thank you so much for
your support, Jimmy.

08:44.905 --> 08:49.432
Jimmy, I know you don't want Austin
to get hurt, but he's still a kid.

08:49.433 --> 08:54.546
Now's the time we're supposed to be
having fun, playing sports, taking risks.

08:54.547 --> 08:58.022
This coming from the girl who wears
a helmet when she jumps rope?

08:58.023 --> 09:02.212
Hey, do you know how many people get
injured jumping rope every year?

09:02.213 --> 09:03.209
Zero?

09:03.210 --> 09:07.250
Exactly, and I am not
gonna be the first.

09:07.251 --> 09:08.518
Sorry, Austin.

09:08.519 --> 09:12.422
But... but, Jimmy, I really
wanted to play basketball.

09:12.423 --> 09:14.239
It's the first time since
my career took off

09:14.240 --> 09:16.193
that I've felt like a
normal high school kid.

09:16.194 --> 09:17.831
You've gotta quit the team.

09:17.832 --> 09:23.732
I hate to break it to you, Austin,
but you're not a normal kid.

09:27.685 --> 09:29.305
I know how you feel, buddy.

09:29.306 --> 09:33.122
People have been telling me I'm
not a normal kid my whole life.

09:33.123 --> 09:35.578
Mmm, sand cookies.

09:35.579 --> 09:39.719
Just like the ones
my grandma makes.

09:49.403 --> 09:52.499
Hey, Austin. What are you doing?

09:52.500 --> 09:54.874
Jimmy doesn't want me to do
anything that can get me hurt,

09:54.875 --> 09:57.469
so I'm saying goodbye
to all my fun stuff.

09:57.470 --> 10:00.826
Goodbye, skateboard.
Goodbye, basketball.

10:00.827 --> 10:03.072
Goodbye, high-tops.

10:03.073 --> 10:07.354
You don't have to get
rid of this stuff.

10:07.355 --> 10:11.324
Actually, maybe you
should get rid of these.

10:11.325 --> 10:14.461
Sorry. I know how much you
wanna play basketball.

10:14.462 --> 10:16.409
I didn't know that when
my career took off

10:16.410 --> 10:18.531
that I'd have to give
up being a regular kid.

10:18.532 --> 10:21.872
I know it doesn't seem fair,
but Jimmy's got a point.

10:21.873 --> 10:24.851
You could get injured and
not be able to perform.

10:24.852 --> 10:28.408
You're right. I'm
gonna quit the team.

10:28.409 --> 10:32.212
But on the other hand, you have
your whole life to be a star.

10:32.213 --> 10:34.746
You're right! I'm not
gonna quit the team!

10:34.747 --> 10:36.886
Then again, all your fans
are counting on you.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.728
Oh, you're right. I'm
gonna quit the team.

10:39.729 --> 10:43.060
But your team and your school
are also counting on you.

10:43.061 --> 10:45.973
You're right! I'm not
gonna quit the team!

10:45.974 --> 10:49.694
Or am I? You're confusing me!

10:50.431 --> 10:52.432
I think you should
play basketball.

10:52.433 --> 10:54.401
Life is full of risks.

10:54.402 --> 11:00.302
That's why I wear a helmet when I jump
rope and elbow pads when I make a salad.

11:00.441 --> 11:04.896
How do you make a salad? Because I'm
pretty sure you're doing it wrong.

11:04.897 --> 11:08.239
I think you should
follow your heart.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.754
Then I'm gonna keep
playing basketball.

11:10.755 --> 11:12.731
I wanna enjoy high school.

11:12.732 --> 11:15.792
Good for you, Austin!

11:16.457 --> 11:18.625
What are you doing?

11:18.626 --> 11:22.286
I'm gonna go brush my teeth.

11:26.367 --> 11:30.322
Hey, Kimmy. Do you mind if I watch
cheer practice for my article?

11:30.323 --> 11:35.408
Sure. I just love it when
people bug me when I'm busy.

11:35.409 --> 11:37.544
Is that a yes or a no?

11:37.545 --> 11:40.330
I can't tell. You're
just so perky.

11:40.331 --> 11:41.681
I know. It's a gift.

11:41.682 --> 11:44.551
Today's a big day. We're
picking our Yell King.

11:44.552 --> 11:49.532
It's down to those two
cheer hunks over there.

11:49.757 --> 11:54.197
Uh, where? All I see
are Dez and Chuck.

11:54.729 --> 11:57.669
Oh yes, very hunky.

11:59.078 --> 12:00.855
Are you boys ready for the game?

12:00.856 --> 12:03.032
You haven't decided who's
gonna be Yell King yet.

12:03.033 --> 12:05.739
It's gonna be me, because
my cheers are the loudest.

12:05.740 --> 12:10.510
Oh yeah? My cheers are so loud,
I get noise complaints...

12:10.511 --> 12:13.022
From dead people.

12:13.023 --> 12:16.449
My cheers are so loud, they come
with earplugs and a warning.

12:16.450 --> 12:20.110
"Warning! My cheers are loud".

12:21.021 --> 12:26.389
Well, my cheers are so loud, when I cheer
in Florida, they tell me to keep it down...

12:26.390 --> 12:28.670
In Canada.

12:29.430 --> 12:31.564
Okay, guys, I've got an idea.

12:31.565 --> 12:34.238
At tomorrow's game,
you'll be co-Yell Kings.

12:34.239 --> 12:38.097
Whoever does the better job gets the
title for the rest of the season! Woo!

12:38.098 --> 12:40.440
Co-Yell Kings? That's not fair!

12:40.441 --> 12:42.809
Remember... always be cheery!

12:42.810 --> 12:45.578
Co-Yell Kings? That's not fair!

12:45.579 --> 12:47.799
Woo! Yay!

12:57.625 --> 12:59.626
Woo! Yeah!

12:59.627 --> 13:01.902
Come on, co-Yell Kings,
get the crowd going!

13:01.903 --> 13:04.664
- Woo! Yeah!
- Let's go, Manatees! Let's go!

13:04.665 --> 13:06.633
Woo! Yeah!

13:06.634 --> 13:08.726
Why you whispering, Red?

13:08.727 --> 13:12.447
Let's go, Manatees! Let's go!

13:12.606 --> 13:15.726
You call that a yell?

13:15.847 --> 13:19.327
Make some noise! Woo! Yeah!

13:20.614 --> 13:22.349
You wanna hear some noise?

13:22.350 --> 13:24.285
I can't hear you!

13:24.286 --> 13:27.166
I can't hear you!

13:52.447 --> 13:55.688
Austin's really good.
This is so exciting.

13:55.689 --> 13:57.549
Yay!

13:57.697 --> 13:59.453
The other team just scored.

13:59.454 --> 14:02.454
It's still exciting.

14:03.486 --> 14:06.786
Stand up and cheer! Woo!

14:06.961 --> 14:08.695
Woo!

14:08.696 --> 14:11.698
Sit down and stomp your feet!

14:11.699 --> 14:14.159
Do the wave!

14:14.229 --> 14:17.003
- Clap your hands!
- Do the wave!

14:17.004 --> 14:18.841
- Clap your hands!
- Do the wave!

14:18.842 --> 14:21.203
- Clap your hands!
- Do the wave!

14:21.204 --> 14:22.338
- Hands! Hands!
- Wave! Wave!

14:22.339 --> 14:24.242
- Hands! Hands!
- Wave! Wave!

14:24.243 --> 14:26.192
Cool! They're doing my dance!

14:26.193 --> 14:28.482
- Hands! Hands! Hands!
- Wave! Wave! Wave!

14:28.483 --> 14:32.983
- Hands! Hands! Hands!
- Wave! Wave! Wave!

14:36.115 --> 14:38.106
Have you decided who's
gonna be Yell King?

14:38.107 --> 14:40.760
It's so hard to decide. You're
both so handsome and cheery.

14:40.761 --> 14:42.921
Stop it.

14:44.052 --> 14:46.628
I'll make this an easy
decision for you, Kimmy.

14:46.629 --> 14:51.189
Step aside, Red. Yell
King coming through.

14:56.932 --> 14:58.792
Woo!

15:00.877 --> 15:06.277
Not bad. Now let me show
you how a real man cheers.

15:20.401 --> 15:23.316
Woo! Let's go, Manatees!

15:23.317 --> 15:24.727
I really hope we score.

15:24.728 --> 15:27.574
Yeah, it'd be nice for Austin
to win his first game.

15:27.575 --> 15:31.091
I don't care who wins. I just don't
want it to go into overtime.

15:31.092 --> 15:36.992
I don't know how much longer I can
pretend to like wiping up sweat.

15:53.948 --> 15:55.808
Woo!

15:57.405 --> 16:00.765
- Austin?
- Are you okay?

16:00.821 --> 16:02.400
I don't know.

16:02.401 --> 16:04.006
I hurt my knee.

16:04.007 --> 16:07.614
That's awful. How are you gonna
dance at the concert tonight?

16:07.615 --> 16:09.441
I don't know if I can.

16:09.442 --> 16:13.067
Oh! That's why Jimmy didn't
want you playing basketball.

16:13.068 --> 16:14.928
Huh!

16:23.636 --> 16:24.808
I got it.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.776
- Ow!
- Oh! Dez!

16:26.777 --> 16:28.611
- Be careful.
- Seriously.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.648
- Come on.
- What am I gonna do?

16:31.649 --> 16:34.689
I'm supposed to perform at the
school and Jimmy's coming.

16:34.690 --> 16:37.320
He's gonna be so mad. He told
you not to play basketball.

16:37.321 --> 16:38.283
I know.

16:38.284 --> 16:40.323
And he's bringing the
owner of the Miami Heat.

16:40.324 --> 16:41.229
I know!

16:41.230 --> 16:42.659
And while we were
at the hospital,

16:42.660 --> 16:44.713
I took five bucks out of
your wallet to buy a snack.

16:44.714 --> 16:48.734
I know. Wait, I
didn't know that.

16:50.430 --> 16:53.470
Why didn't you just listen
to Jimmy in the first place?

16:53.471 --> 16:56.429
Because you told me not to.

16:56.430 --> 16:58.950
Yeah, I was hoping
you forgot that.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.975
Look, it's not your fault.

17:00.976 --> 17:05.382
I made the decision to play and I just have
to be honest with Jimmy about my knee.

17:05.383 --> 17:06.715
Here he comes!

17:06.717 --> 17:08.060
Forget honesty! Help me hide it!

17:08.060 --> 17:10.619
- Oh oh oh.
- Go go go.

17:10.621 --> 17:12.421
Ow.

17:12.455 --> 17:14.556
Oh. Oh!

17:16.146 --> 17:18.127
Jimmy!

17:18.496 --> 17:21.069
- 'Sup?
- What happened to you?

17:21.069 --> 17:24.061
I hurt my leg cheer leading.

17:24.063 --> 17:26.936
- I know you told me not to.
- I didn't tell you not to.

17:26.938 --> 17:29.711
I should've been more like
Austin and listened to

17:29.712 --> 17:32.442
you and not done the thing
you told me not to do.

17:32.443 --> 17:36.152
What? Man, I will
never understand you.

17:36.153 --> 17:38.748
Hey, check this out.

17:38.749 --> 17:42.585
Usher played halftime at
a Heat Game last night.

17:42.586 --> 17:43.653
- Oh wow.
- Cool.

17:43.654 --> 17:45.722
- Check it out.
- Oh.

17:45.723 --> 17:47.078
Look at that.

17:47.079 --> 17:51.879
You can't see it from there.
Get over here.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.220
Oh, that is cool.

17:58.221 --> 18:00.570
That could be you if you put
on a great show tonight.

18:00.571 --> 18:02.916
Oh, it'll be great.

18:02.917 --> 18:05.340
Just me sitting on a
stool, playing my guitar.

18:05.341 --> 18:09.712
Better not be. My friend from The Heat's
expecting the full Austin Moon experience.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.954
Singing, dancing
and more dancing.

18:12.955 --> 18:18.169
Are you sure he wouldn't like
singing, sitting and more sitting?

18:18.170 --> 18:21.352
Hilarious. Austin,
I'll see you tonight.

18:21.353 --> 18:25.493
- Break a leg.
- Would a knee work?

18:33.581 --> 18:37.607
There's no better way to end spirit week
than with an Austin Moon performance.

18:37.608 --> 18:40.886
Will he pull it off? Or will his
knee buckle under the pressure?

18:40.887 --> 18:43.249
Did you just say his
knee's gonna buckle?

18:43.250 --> 18:48.118
No. I said "he". "Will he
buckle under the pressure?"

18:48.119 --> 18:50.759
That was close.

18:52.269 --> 18:56.929
Fellow students, this performance was
brought to you by Trish De La Rosa.

18:56.930 --> 18:59.360
In honor of school spirit week.

18:59.361 --> 19:03.662
Because no one loves
Marino High more than me.

19:03.663 --> 19:06.063
Go mustangs!

19:06.154 --> 19:11.014

21:10.277 --> 21:13.446
Check it out. I'm
a reporter now.

21:13.447 --> 21:16.819
My article on spirit week made the
front page of the school paper.

21:16.820 --> 21:19.586
Nice! We really do have a paper.

21:19.587 --> 21:23.222
I thought you were
just making that up.

21:23.223 --> 21:27.001
Hey, I heard you officially
quit the basketball team.

21:27.002 --> 21:30.038
Sorry you can't have a
normal teenage life.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.240
Nah, I'm okay with it...

21:32.241 --> 21:35.338
Because I get to perform
halftime at a Heat Game!

21:35.339 --> 21:37.236
Congrats, Austin.

21:37.237 --> 21:39.141
We should go get
milkshakes to celebrate.

21:39.142 --> 21:41.783
I'll grab my safety gloves.

21:41.784 --> 21:45.324
How do you drink milkshakes?

21:45.345 --> 21:47.916
Guess who just won
school spirit week.

21:47.917 --> 21:50.752
I'm meeting Kimmy here to
collect my prize money.

21:50.753 --> 21:52.019
Here you go, Trish...

21:52.020 --> 21:55.140
1,000 manatee dollars!

21:55.512 --> 21:58.802
What? What's a manatee dollar?

21:58.803 --> 22:01.195
You use them to buy merchandise
at the school store.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.233
You're so lucky!

22:03.234 --> 22:06.633
You mean I did all that
spirit stuff for nothing?

22:06.634 --> 22:08.301
Not for nothing.

22:08.302 --> 22:10.537
You can buy manatee backpacks,
manatee lunchboxes,

22:10.538 --> 22:12.438
manatee notebooks,
manatee pencils...

22:12.439 --> 22:15.291
What kind of doof would
want any of that junk?

22:15.292 --> 22:18.578
Guys! Check it out! The school
store is having a sale...

22:18.579 --> 22:21.190
I got a manatee backpack,
manatee lunchbox,

22:21.191 --> 22:22.711
manatee notebook,
manatee pencils,

22:22.712 --> 22:24.618
manatee yoga mat, manatee clogs,

22:24.619 --> 22:29.059
manatee dance pants,
manatee legwarmers...

22:31.517 --> 22:34.976
Hey, guys, great news. Kimmy
picked Chuck to be Yell King.

22:34.977 --> 22:36.214
Oh!

22:36.215 --> 22:39.111
Why is that great news? I thought
you wanted to be Yell King.

22:39.112 --> 22:43.373
I did, until I found out what Yell
King had to do at halftime. Mmm!

22:43.374 --> 22:45.776
Why did I want to be Yell King?

22:45.777 --> 22:48.316
I'll get you for this...

22:48.317 --> 22:51.437
Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeezzzz!

22:54.484 --> 22:56.787
You know what? He
is louder than me.

22:56.788 --> 22:58.648
Woo!
