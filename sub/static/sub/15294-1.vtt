01:50.960 --> 01:53.340
Go on! Go on, you lazy nag!

01:57.200 --> 01:59.190
Stop a moment!

02:01.960 --> 02:03.670
Go on!

02:04.920 --> 02:06.310
Go on!

02:07.960 --> 02:11.580
Wilber.
Wilber, you're not well enough.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.830
For once, let it pass.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.070
If you leave your horse alone 
for an hour, he might recover.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.590
And who the hell are you?

02:26.319 --> 02:27.430
Hey.

02:29.240 --> 02:32.710
I've seen him speak in London.
That's William Wilberforce.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.470
- Now what?
- Leave it.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.380
- Welcome home, sir.
- You're so late!

03:04.480 --> 03:06.470
The mud stole half a day.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.670
But Marianne, look.
I have a surprise for you.

03:12.280 --> 03:16.590
- I hope a pleasant one.
- Wilber. Wilber, is that you?

03:16.760 --> 03:21.150
Oh, it is, half of me. My idiotic 
body is playing games with me again.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.030
- I promised we'd make him well.
- Eat something.

03:24.200 --> 03:27.350
Breakfast, perhaps.
Not too early. I'm on holiday.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.550
Isn't that right, cousin Henry?

03:30.720 --> 03:34.790
Don't you talk to each other? 
Haven't you told him he's killing himself?

03:34.960 --> 03:37.910
Now he's with us, he'll be fine.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.750
What time is it?

04:20.920 --> 04:24.430
This is your 3 a.m. dose.

04:24.600 --> 04:28.870
So, cousin, you're waking me up 
to give me medicine to help me sleep.

04:29.040 --> 04:34.030
Ah. Now you're taking on the medical 
profession, as well as everyone else.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.140
Did you sleep?

04:42.320 --> 04:44.950
Sleep is more exhausting than being awake.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.230
The laudanum will sharpen your dreams.

04:48.400 --> 04:53.230
It replays my life to mock me and shows 
me things I should have done but didn't.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.710
Wilber, Parliament doesn't deserve you.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.190
Your last bill was defeated because 
four of your loyal supporters

05:00.360 --> 05:04.510
took free tickets to a comic opera '
rather than stay to vote.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.990
In my dreams, 
I turned over their tables.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.990
But you know the worst thing?
I can't sing any more.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.150
You remember how well I used to sing?

05:18.320 --> 05:21.510
Marianne and I will find a way 
to restore your voice.

05:53.400 --> 05:57.910
The Romans believed this water 
would restore the dead to life.

05:58.080 --> 06:02.230
Most pump water I've investigated 
works in the opposite direction.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.270
So?

06:07.520 --> 06:10.630
- What was so urgent?
- Did I say it was urgent?

06:13.160 --> 06:15.750
Marianne, are you expecting someone else?

06:20.320 --> 06:25.310
Inside this building, you will find 
the secret of health and happy life.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.070
In a glass of water?

06:27.240 --> 06:28.430
You may have noticed,

06:28.600 --> 06:32.220
since I married Marianne, 
I have been a picture of health.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.350
- I'm very happy for you.
- It is almost a scientific fact.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.910
Marriage and health are twins.
Inseparable.

06:39.080 --> 06:43.550
Single men wither away and die 
in rooms that smell of feet and armpits.

06:43.720 --> 06:46.180
Henry, what are you babbling on about?

06:46.360 --> 06:50.110
Love, Wilberforce.
Come. Come, we're late.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.390
The water has been here a million years.
How can we be late?

06:53.560 --> 06:57.100
- So, what shall we discuss next?
- I don't know.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.510
The abolition of the slave trade.
How about that?

07:00.680 --> 07:04.910
Marianne, if I'd known you were so 
starved of political conversation,

07:05.080 --> 07:07.990
I'd have wrapped up a Tory and 
sent him to your home by mail

07:08.160 --> 07:10.150
for you to shout at.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.230
Ah, now, look at that.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.230
Here we are discussing the 
abolition of the slave trade

07:15.400 --> 07:18.790
and in walks my husband with 
William Wilberforce himself,

07:18.960 --> 07:22.710
the most committed abolitionist 
in England and also, of course,

07:22.880 --> 07:24.870
the most unmarried.

07:28.360 --> 07:32.510
Oh. Look over there. It's Marianne.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.240
And who's the charming-looking 
woman with her?

07:35.400 --> 07:37.670
- Marianne's here?
- Never mind about her.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.990
Look at the woman she's with.
Barbara Spooner.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.510
Very committed to very many good causes.

07:43.680 --> 07:47.110
And also entirely unmarried.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.070
Marianne, you're outrageous!

07:54.520 --> 07:58.950
I do not need you or anyone else 
to find a wife for me!

08:09.840 --> 08:13.510
Carriage! Carriage over here.

08:23.160 --> 08:26.350
- I'll never forgive him.
- I'll never forgive her.

08:29.560 --> 08:34.679
However, Mr Wilberforce, 
if we had met in other circumstances,

08:34.840 --> 08:38.190
I would have told you how deeply 
I admire your tireless efforts

08:38.360 --> 08:41.549
to force our ridiculous Parliament 
to abolish the slave trade.

08:41.720 --> 08:45.310
If you had, I would have changed 
the subject and talked about botany.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.830
Botany? Why botany?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.470
Anything but politics.
I'm in Bath to be cured of politics.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.910
Well, I would have been bored by botany.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.910
So, even in other circumstances, 
it would have been a disaster.

09:01.720 --> 09:04.710
- Good day to you.
- Good day to you.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.070
Some simple truths about this horrendous war

09:47.240 --> 09:51.350
need to be restated for the 
benefit of my honourable friends.

09:51.520 --> 09:56.640
Simple fact. We have the rebels 
on the anvil and a hammer in our hands.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.550
There is no question that our military force

10:00.720 --> 10:03.150
is far superior to that of the Americans.

10:03.320 --> 10:07.630
But we must distinguish 
between force and justice.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.830
Where did this terrier spring from?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.460
I believe he's a Yorkshire terrier, My Lord.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.940
...rather than able statesmen.

10:15.120 --> 10:18.430
Surely it is time for the fat 
fellow and his friends opposite

10:18.600 --> 10:21.790
to make way for others who 
consider the good of their country

10:21.960 --> 10:24.830
of greater moment than their own personal interests.

10:26.720 --> 10:30.500
Doesn't he know what dangers await 
anyone who talks sense in this place?

10:30.680 --> 10:32.670
Oh, I think he's equal to the dangers.

10:32.840 --> 10:37.190
My honourable friend suggests 
we surrender to the revolutionaries.

10:37.360 --> 10:41.550
Revolution is like a pox.
It spreads from person to person.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.150
I bow to my honourable friend's 
superior knowledge and experience

10:45.320 --> 10:48.710
in all matters regarding the pox.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.950
Why would we withdraw from America

11:00.120 --> 11:02.830
when half of the Americans are loyal to the Crown?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.590
Less than one in four Americans are loyal.

11:06.760 --> 11:11.070
If he calls that half, 
I'd hate to be his wife and share half his bed.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.950
Mr Foreign Secretary.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.190
My honourable and young friend 
should explain to the House

11:18.360 --> 11:22.270
the difference between appeasement 
and surrender.

11:22.440 --> 11:25.710
Hear, hear!

11:28.400 --> 11:33.310
The difference between appeasement and 
surrender is merely a matter of time

11:33.480 --> 11:36.950
and perhaps 10,000 more young lives

11:37.120 --> 11:40.740
wasted for no reason.

11:46.720 --> 11:47.820
Go on.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.950
Two guineas.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.310
Sweet Prospero, why hast thou forsaken me?

11:54.840 --> 11:59.630
Brave in the House, but at the table a mouse.

11:59.800 --> 12:04.920
Your Grace, you know these merchant 
boys are richer than we are.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.270
Aye. I have ten guineas left.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.820
So ten it is.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.150
In or out, Wilberforce?

12:29.920 --> 12:31.710
- A pencil and paper.
- No, no, no.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.470
Brooks's Club house rules. No IOUs.

12:34.640 --> 12:38.340
Amongst gentlemen, perhaps, 
but Wilberforce is a tradesman.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.110
You gamble with what you have with you.

12:43.200 --> 12:47.390
Wilberforce, will you take my IOU?

12:50.280 --> 12:54.950
- We split the pot and call it evens.
- To hell with that. Payment in kind.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.470
There's nothing you have I'd want, Your Grace.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.550
Tarleton, fetch my nigger.

13:08.520 --> 13:12.590
My coach driver.
Go and wake him up and bring him in now.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.670
I bought a nigger in Port of Spain.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.710
He eats better than I do, so he's strong as an ox.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.910
He'd fetch at least 25 guineas at the West India Dock.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.350
The game is over.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.070
What's wrong, Wilberforce?

13:36.240 --> 13:39.150
If I hadn't brought the boy to London,

13:39.320 --> 13:41.950
he'd have been worked to 
death in a sugar cane field.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.590
I saved his miserable life. There.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.910
I raise the stakes.

13:58.480 --> 14:02.470
Wilberforce? In the game or out?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.110
Evening.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.550
You act as if you'd never seen slavery before.

14:30.720 --> 14:34.710
For me it's like arsenic.
Each new tiny dose doubles the effect.

14:44.360 --> 14:49.550
- You're not afraid of Clarence.
- Because he's the son of the king?

14:49.720 --> 14:54.110
So, you want 
- "bloody noses and cracked crowns"?

14:54.280 --> 14:58.030
<i>- Shakespeare, Henry IV.
- A play about England changing.</i>

14:58.200 --> 15:01.070
- As it will soon change.- Only if we change it.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.230
You don't believe you and I could change things?

15:07.400 --> 15:09.990
I would change myself first.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.510
Do you remember, Billy, at Cambridge

15:25.680 --> 15:28.430
I had a reputation as something of a singer?

15:28.600 --> 15:30.390
I do remember.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.350
So I think I'm going to go and sing them a song.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.900
Silence!

15:48.280 --> 15:50.150
Silence!

15:53.720 --> 15:57.420
You sound like a chorus of bloody tomcats.

15:57.600 --> 16:02.620
Now, let me introduce you to 
somebody who does it properly.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.580
I dedicate this song to my honourable friend,

16:08.760 --> 16:12.030
His Grace, the Duke of Clarence.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.950
It was written by my old preacher.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.830
He was captain of a slave ship for 20 years.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.350
He repented his sins and 
then he wrote this song.

16:23.440 --> 16:28.630
<i># Amazing Grace</i>

16:28.800 --> 16:34.510
<i>- # How sweet the sound
- Times are hard for the militant boys!</i>

16:34.680 --> 16:39.510
<i># That saved a wretch</i>

16:39.680 --> 16:44.540
<i># Like me</i>

16:44.720 --> 16:50.710
<i># I once was lost</i>

16:50.880 --> 16:56.830
<i># But now am found</i>

16:57.880 --> 17:01.030
<i># Was blind</i>

17:01.200 --> 17:04.190
<i># But now</i>

17:04.359 --> 17:07.510
<i># I see #</i>

17:48.440 --> 17:51.910
Dear God, I know this is utterly absurd,

17:52.080 --> 17:55.070
but I feel I have to meet you in secret.

17:57.920 --> 18:01.830
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
There is a beggar at the kitchen door.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.550
I would turn him away, sir, 
but you insisted I always check.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.310
Just give him breakfast.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.350
Very good, sir.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.670
- Richard?
- Sir?

18:22.480 --> 18:26.390
I know that lying down on the 
wet grass is not a normal thing to do.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.350
None of my business, sir.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.510
Truth is, uh...

18:35.400 --> 18:40.150
...I've been even more strange 
than usual lately, haven't I?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.830
It's God.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.430
I have 10,000 engagements of state today,

18:45.600 --> 18:48.310
but I would prefer to spend 
the day getting a wet arse,

18:48.480 --> 18:53.110
studying dandelions and marvelling at bloody spiders' webs.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.990
You've found God, sir?

18:58.720 --> 18:59.830
I think he found me.

19:01.360 --> 19:06.190
Do you have any idea how inconvenient that is,

19:06.360 --> 19:09.070
how idiotic it will sound?

19:09.240 --> 19:11.950
I've a political career glittering ahead of me

19:12.120 --> 19:15.390
and in my heart I want spiders' webs.

19:26.200 --> 19:30.470
"It is a sad fate for a man to 
die too well-known to everybody else

19:30.640 --> 19:33.230
and still unknown to himself."

19:35.240 --> 19:37.470
Francis Bacon.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.230
I don'tjust dust your books, sir.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.550
When I was 15, I almost ran away with the circus.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.310
They said I could have been an acrobat.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.510
- Good morning, Mr Pitt.
- Morning.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.510
Excuse me, sir.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.870
You read my letter.

20:12.040 --> 20:15.310
The man who wrote that letter was not you.

20:15.480 --> 20:19.430
It was written by some wild preacher 
man that has gotten into your head.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.590
No.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.910
- So did he reply?
- Who

20:29.080 --> 20:33.190
God. You were going to ask God whether 
you should take up politics or religion.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.110
You're always too direct, Billy.

20:35.280 --> 20:38.470
I urgently need to know where your heart lies, Wilber.

20:38.640 --> 20:41.150
- What's urgent?
- I...

20:46.080 --> 20:47.990
I'm planning to become prime minister.

20:51.080 --> 20:55.590
- Some day.
- No, I mean soon. Very soon.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.390
Thanks to your performances in the House, 
Fox and North will resign.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.470
Lord Rockingham will become prime minister.

21:04.640 --> 21:09.830
Lord Rockingham's health is not good.
When he dies, I will make my move.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.830
- You've worked it all out.
- I want you beside me, Wilber.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.630
All the way.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.070
You've read my letter but not taken in a word.

21:18.240 --> 21:22.390
I would have you in my government 
in whichever capacity you choose.

21:23.880 --> 21:27.630
Billy, no one of our age has ever taken power.

21:27.800 --> 21:32.820
Which is why we're too young to 
realise that certain things are impossible.

21:33.520 --> 21:36.110
So we will do them anyway.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.510
I need an answer, Wilber.

21:40.320 --> 21:45.070
Do you intend to use your beautiful 
voice to praise the Lord

21:45.240 --> 21:47.830
or change the world?

21:51.680 --> 21:53.790
Here. Cut this, will you?

21:53.960 --> 21:58.230
- I've got too much to do.
- You take care of them.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.990
Any more flour?

22:00.160 --> 22:03.150
- I can't!
- Put your elbow into it.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.510
Marjorie, Mr Wilberforce is on his way down.

22:19.400 --> 22:23.590
Marjorie, I'm expecting some people for dinner.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.860
Marjorie? Marjorie?

22:31.400 --> 22:33.550
- She's been run off her feet, sir.
- How so?

22:33.720 --> 22:37.070
Well, take today, for example.
You have 25 guests for lunch.

22:37.240 --> 22:38.340
Do I?

22:45.880 --> 22:50.110
If you remember, you decided 
to reward various volunteers

22:50.280 --> 22:54.030
who worked for some quite 
precariously financed charities.

22:54.200 --> 22:58.430
Some brought deserving children.
Others brought less deserving relatives.

22:59.480 --> 23:05.070
- I really should get some sort of...
- Diary, sir. Yes. Or more cooks.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.350
Go on! Go on!

23:16.520 --> 23:19.080
Is that the appetiser?

23:19.240 --> 23:21.870
No, that's His Grace, the Duke of Clarence.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.230
Wilberforce, the Reverend John Ramsay.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.910
Reverend.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.540
Edward Hope.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.280
And Michael Shaw. Both friends.

23:37.040 --> 23:41.980
- This is Olaudah Equiano.
- Mr Equiano. Please.

23:43.120 --> 23:47.110
- You've travelled far to be here?
- No distance would be too great.

23:49.800 --> 23:54.270
- And this is Hannah Moore.
- Mr Wilberforce.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.630
Who has travelled all the way from Clapham.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.910
Finally, let me introduce Mr Thomas Clarkson.

24:00.080 --> 24:03.750
Beautiful house. Sweet little rabbit.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.790
It's a hare, actually.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.950
Please.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.990
So come on. Who are they?

24:16.160 --> 24:18.540
Why don't you ask them?

24:27.280 --> 24:31.510
Well, I hope the goose is tender.
She was rather old.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.470
I find the older I get, the more tender I become.

24:39.400 --> 24:44.150
So, Miss Moore, you live in Clapham.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.310
I hear it's very tranquil there.

24:46.480 --> 24:49.550
When certain issues are raised amongst my friends and I,

24:49.720 --> 24:51.950
it is anything but tranquil.

24:52.120 --> 24:55.310
Ah. And, uh, which issues are those?

24:55.480 --> 24:58.910
Issues regarding the making of a better world.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.950
Better in which way?

25:01.120 --> 25:05.070
If you make the world better in one way, 
it becomes better in every way.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.230
Don't you think?

25:09.800 --> 25:12.910
Mr Equiano, what business brings you to London?

25:13.080 --> 25:16.270
My business in London is you, 
Mr Wilberforce.

25:16.440 --> 25:19.670
What? You wish to discuss something with me?

25:19.840 --> 25:22.470
No. We do not want to talk

25:22.640 --> 25:26.510
because we hear that you are 
a man who doesn't believe what he hears

25:26.680 --> 25:29.270
until he sees it with his own eyes.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.190
These are for the legs.

25:57.760 --> 25:58.950
These for the arms.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.100
This is for the neck.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.870
Works like so.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.590
When the slaves leave port in Africa,

26:17.760 --> 26:20.550
they're locked into a space four foot by 18 inches.

26:20.720 --> 26:25.230
They have no sanitation, 
very little food, stagnant water.

26:25.400 --> 26:30.790
Their waste and blood fills the holes 
within three days and is never emptied.

26:30.960 --> 26:36.310
These irons and chains are to 
keep them from throwing themselves overboard.

26:36.480 --> 26:41.990
The chains are not unlocked 
until you reach the plantation in Jamaica.

26:42.160 --> 26:45.430
Around half of the slaves are dead already.

26:46.560 --> 26:49.550
In the markets, they stuff knotted rope

26:49.720 --> 26:52.670
into the anuses of those who are sick

26:52.840 --> 26:55.950
to disguise the dysentery.

26:56.120 --> 27:01.510
When you reach the plantation, 
they put irons to the fire...

27:02.800 --> 27:04.590
...and do this.

27:05.840 --> 27:10.830
To let you know that you no 
longer belong to God, but to a man.

27:12.800 --> 27:17.590
Mr Wilberforce, 
we understand you're having problems

27:17.760 --> 27:20.590
choosing whether to do the work of God

27:20.760 --> 27:23.430
or the work of a political activist.

27:25.960 --> 27:30.630
We humbly suggest that you can do both.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.870
You planned this.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.420
I've seen the literature you've been reading.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.550
You've stooped to searching through my desk?

28:05.720 --> 28:09.950
Sir William Dolben told me you'd 
asked to be shown round the East India Docks.

28:15.280 --> 28:19.710
So, you would use my private 
concerns for your own political ends.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.550
Yes, exactly that.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.950
The principles of Christianity 
lead to action as well as meditation.

28:30.120 --> 28:33.190
Allow me to meditate on it 
before I decide on any action.

28:33.360 --> 28:37.030
Just think about this, Wilber.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.510
The slave trade has 300 MPs in its pocket.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.760
It would be just you against them.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.150
But you could do it.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.350
You would do it.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.260
Oh, stop moaning.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.550
Excuse me, sir.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.190
Do you have a penny for a boy 
that went to fight the Yanks

29:25.360 --> 29:26.550
and came back half a man?

29:43.880 --> 29:46.230
Hello, Mr Newton. It's me, William.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.070
Hello, John. How are you?

29:53.560 --> 29:55.670
Hello, John. It's me, Wilber.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.510
I'm here to seek your...

30:16.240 --> 30:19.630
The beggar at the door assures 
me that I'm now old enough

30:19.800 --> 30:22.100
to call you John.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.910
You're dressing very simply these days.

30:29.080 --> 30:34.390
I'm a simple man. I try to pretend 
I am a monk, but I don't have the willpower.

30:34.560 --> 30:37.910
I'm a monk Mondays, Wednesdays...

30:38.080 --> 30:42.830
When I read your name in the papers, 
doing these great things,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.910
I still see a tiny boy with his hair a mess

30:46.080 --> 30:48.540
and ink on his fingers.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.510
So, what do you want with an old creature?

30:55.680 --> 30:58.240
I'm here to seek your advice.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.870
When you were a child, 
you used to ask God for advice.

31:02.040 --> 31:05.870
Then I grew up. And grew foolish.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.870
And now?

31:10.520 --> 31:14.270
Now... slowly, my faith is returning.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.000
How slowly?

31:17.160 --> 31:20.350
No bolts of lightning.

31:20.520 --> 31:26.230
God sometimes does his work 
with gentle drizzle, not storms.

31:26.400 --> 31:30.310
Drip... drip... drip.

31:33.240 --> 31:36.390
My friend William Pitt has declared an interest in me.

31:36.560 --> 31:37.990
William who?

31:39.840 --> 31:42.070
He's offering me a place in the world.

31:42.240 --> 31:46.070
Just make sure you're in the world, not of the world.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.900
There'd be no escape from power once I have it.

31:51.080 --> 31:54.590
- I would have to see things through.
- Why wouldn't you?

32:00.800 --> 32:03.470
Are you contemplating a life of solitude?

32:07.520 --> 32:10.030
Wilber, you have work to do.

32:10.200 --> 32:14.230
Besides, people like you too much

32:14.400 --> 32:16.550
to let you live a life of solitude.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.550
Haven't you chosen solitude?

32:18.720 --> 32:23.910
You, of all people, should know I can never be alone.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.830
There now.

32:28.760 --> 32:32.590
- There now what?
- You're the reason I came.

32:33.800 --> 32:38.990
You told me that you live in the company of 20,000 ghosts.

32:39.160 --> 32:42.150
The ghosts of slaves.

32:44.600 --> 32:48.470
I was explaining to a child

32:48.640 --> 32:54.150
why a grown man cowers in a dark corner.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.230
I need you to tell me about them.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.270
I'm not strong enough to hear my own confession.

33:08.040 --> 33:11.510
- I thought time might have changed you.
- It has. I'm older.

33:11.680 --> 33:15.350
Pitt has asked me to take them on, the slavers.

33:15.520 --> 33:18.270
I'm the last person you should come to for advice.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.740
I can't even say the name of any of my ships

33:20.920 --> 33:23.950
without being back onboard them in my head.

33:24.120 --> 33:29.060
All I know is 20,000 slaves 
live with me in this little church.

33:29.240 --> 33:33.270
- There's still blood on my hands.
- Will you help me, John?

33:33.440 --> 33:35.950
I can't help you.

33:36.120 --> 33:39.900
But do it, Wilber. Do it.

33:40.080 --> 33:43.860
Take them on. Blow their dirty, 
filthy ships out of the water.

33:44.040 --> 33:46.600
The planters, sugar barons,

33:46.760 --> 33:50.540
Alderman "Sugar Cane", 
the Lord Mayor of London.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.710
Liverpool, Boston, Bristol, New York.

33:53.880 --> 33:59.430
All their streets running 
with blood, dysentery, puke!

34:00.600 --> 34:04.220
You won't come away from those streets clean, Wilber.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.750
You'll get filthy with it, you'll dream it,

34:07.920 --> 34:10.710
see it in broad daylight.

34:10.880 --> 34:15.150
But do it. For God's sake.

34:21.440 --> 34:24.550
Sir, I have Mr Thomas Clarkson.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.710
Forgive me.
Mr Wilberforce was here a moment ago.

34:32.679 --> 34:35.060
I'd better go and find him.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.989
- Good afternoon.
- Sorry if I alarmed you.

34:59.040 --> 35:02.740
I had this box made up in the 
exact dimensions of a slave berth.

35:04.360 --> 35:08.350
I thought you could use it 
in your practical demonstrations.

35:10.920 --> 35:15.190
Why did you wait until your butler 
had left before you got out of the box?

35:16.480 --> 35:18.910
They all think I'm mad already.

35:21.240 --> 35:24.590
As will most people in the House of Commons

35:24.760 --> 35:27.470
when I present my bill.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.510
<i>Wilberforce, conditions in Jamaica</i>

35:36.680 --> 35:39.830
<i>are far more brutal than I could have imagined.</i>

35:40.000 --> 35:45.020
<i>Many children are scalded to 
death by the molten lava.</i>

35:45.200 --> 35:50.430
<i>Others die of exhaustion or roll 
into the fires in their sleep.</i>

35:50.600 --> 35:55.230
<i>The result in the morning is a 
few pounds of pure, refined sugar.</i>

35:58.480 --> 36:01.510
Wilberforce, are you all right?

36:04.160 --> 36:06.150
Sit up for me.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.950
Here, drink this.

36:17.280 --> 36:21.630
- What happened?
- I read James's letter from Jamaica.

36:21.800 --> 36:25.190
When I fell asleep, it was as if I were living inside it.

36:26.880 --> 36:30.660
Perhaps the laudanum the doctor gave you is badly mixed.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.750
I know the effects of opium, Henry.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.270
- This isn't the medication.
- What, then?

36:37.440 --> 36:40.310
I was chosen for this task and I failed.

36:42.760 --> 36:47.880
Some part of me does not accept the idea that I've given up.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.910
- I'll dilute this.
- Can you dilute what I feel?

36:53.920 --> 36:58.310
You've given your youth and your health for this cause.

36:58.480 --> 37:01.390
It's time to let someone else try.

37:21.440 --> 37:25.110
So, Mr Wilberforce...

37:25.280 --> 37:27.660
...I understand you have an interest in botany.

37:30.600 --> 37:34.590
Botany, Miss Spooner? Whatever gives 
you the idea that I might be interested

37:34.760 --> 37:37.060
in something as tedious as botany?

37:50.560 --> 37:54.710
Sorry. It's a private joke.

38:00.760 --> 38:04.710
Now, Wilber, I know you're not interested in botany,

38:04.880 --> 38:10.390
but there's a fascinating creeping 
ivy up the far end of the garden.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.590
Barbara, you really must go and see it too.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.750
Go on.

38:22.120 --> 38:25.310
To irritate them, let's pretend to argue.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.990
- What about?
- Something we disagree on.

38:28.160 --> 38:30.150
Think of something.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.310
The war in France.

38:33.480 --> 38:37.070
I think we should settle with Napoleon right now.

38:37.240 --> 38:40.150
So do I. Schools.

38:40.320 --> 38:43.070
I'm a member of your movement for free education.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.860
I agreed with every word you 
said on the Dales factory debate.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.030
You read every word?

38:50.440 --> 38:52.870
- No.
- Neither did I.

38:55.080 --> 38:58.990
- Gin.
- Replace it in the cities with beer.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.260
Absolutely.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.630
I'm definitely alone in my opinions about animals.

39:05.800 --> 39:08.630
No. I joined your society for the prevention of cruelty.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.550
Well, I'm extreme. I have a pet fox, 
a pet rat and a crow that can't fly.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.100
I used to have a pet hare, but it died of kindness.

39:15.280 --> 39:18.070
America.

39:18.240 --> 39:21.990
We must reassess the power of 
the collective political process.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.260
Agreed.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.470
Oh, and, of course, we are agreed on slavery.

39:25.640 --> 39:29.110
I'm against flowers in church.
What do you say to that?

39:29.280 --> 39:31.270
I am for them.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.990
As am I.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.150
I shouldn't talk about the slave trade?

39:40.800 --> 39:43.360
I've spent so many years talking about it.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.750
So, what are a few more minutes?

39:45.920 --> 39:48.150
When Mr Pitt first became prime minister,

39:48.320 --> 39:52.430
the two of you were like meteorites 
shooting through our imagination.

39:52.600 --> 39:56.430
- Whose imaginations?
- Girls my age.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.590
You stopped taking sugar in your tea?

39:58.760 --> 40:01.390
I wore an abolition badge made by Josiah Wedgwood.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.350
He was a good friend to us.

40:03.520 --> 40:07.300
And I travelled 30 miles in the rain 
to hear Thomas Clarkson speak.

40:07.480 --> 40:10.510
- Did he deafen you?
- He opened my eyes.

40:10.680 --> 40:12.910
- I met the African.
- Equiano.

40:13.080 --> 40:16.910
He came to town with a hundred 
copies of his book. They sold in an hour.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.670
- You signed our petitions.
- A hundred times.

40:19.840 --> 40:24.110
A hundred times. Three million names, 
a million candles to read them by.

40:24.280 --> 40:27.350
- Must have been so exciting.
- Exciting?

40:27.520 --> 40:30.550
It seemed that every spring the daffodils came out,

40:30.720 --> 40:32.870
every summer the cherries ripened

40:33.040 --> 40:36.740
and every autumn William Wilberforce 
would present his bill to the House.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.870
- And still...
- And still...?

40:39.040 --> 40:41.830
And still, after all the badges, the petitions,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.790
all the speeches and the bills,

40:43.960 --> 40:49.080
ships full of human souls in 
chains sail around the world as cargo!

41:08.040 --> 41:09.510
I'm sorry.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.910
- This is why I shouldn't talk about it.
- I think you should.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.870
There. We've found something we disagree on.

41:40.360 --> 41:44.270
"Am I not a man whose soul is drawn to heaven

41:44.440 --> 41:47.630
like water from the dark well of Africa?"

41:47.800 --> 41:49.190
From Equiano's book.

41:50.600 --> 41:53.270
He was a man like no other.

41:54.760 --> 41:57.590
Please, tell me about him.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.790
It seems to me

42:06.960 --> 42:11.670
that if there is a bad taste in your mouth, 
you spit it out.

42:12.560 --> 42:15.390
You don't constantly swallow it back.

42:25.560 --> 42:28.630
<i>Not long after I first met him,</i>

42:28.800 --> 42:32.150
<i>he asked me to come to the East India Dock.</i>

42:32.320 --> 42:35.110
<i>He said there was a ship I should see.</i>

42:35.280 --> 42:37.660
<i>A ship he knew well.</i>

42:42.680 --> 42:44.390
Mr Equiano.

42:47.560 --> 42:49.790
This way.

42:55.120 --> 42:57.030
Thank you, sir.

42:57.200 --> 43:00.310
- Hello.
- Sweetheart.

43:24.280 --> 43:27.350
They make you lie in this space.

43:27.520 --> 43:32.350
The shackles dislocate your hip or your shoulder.

43:32.520 --> 43:35.230
You are in pain all the way around the world.

43:47.680 --> 43:49.670
How long is the journey?

43:49.840 --> 43:52.630
Three weeks, if the weather is good.

43:55.560 --> 43:59.470
For amusement, they sometimes hang the women from these,

43:59.640 --> 44:02.020
by the ankles, to rape them.

44:04.240 --> 44:07.190
In stormy weather, they take the very sickest

44:07.360 --> 44:11.350
and throw them into the sea to lighten the ship's load.

44:17.440 --> 44:19.230
How did you survive?

44:19.400 --> 44:23.630
Your life is a thread.
It breaks or it doesn't break.

44:25.960 --> 44:28.340
Before I travelled in a ship like this,

44:28.520 --> 44:32.750
I was a prince, in many ways not unlike you.

44:47.720 --> 44:50.100
It was a beautiful day like no other,

44:50.280 --> 44:52.870
the last day I saw my home in Africa.

44:58.160 --> 45:00.150
It is with a heavy heart

45:00.320 --> 45:02.750
that I bring to the attention of this House

45:02.920 --> 45:07.510
a trade which degrades men to the level of brutes

45:07.680 --> 45:13.190
and insults the highest qualities 
of our common nature.

45:13.360 --> 45:16.310
I am speaking of... the slave trade.

45:21.360 --> 45:24.350
I know that many of my honourable friends in this House

45:24.520 --> 45:27.350
have interests in the Indies.

45:27.520 --> 45:32.110
Others have investments in plantations.
Others are ship owners.

45:32.280 --> 45:35.710
And I believe them to be men of humanity.

45:35.880 --> 45:39.350
I believe you all to be men of humanity.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.710
If the wretchedness of any one

45:41.880 --> 45:44.670
of the many hundreds of slaves stowed in their ships

45:44.840 --> 45:48.510
could be brought to view...

45:51.720 --> 45:54.020
Order! Order!

45:54.200 --> 45:57.670
I can hardly believe my ears.

45:57.840 --> 46:02.150
We can hardly believe your mouth.

46:02.320 --> 46:07.790
It seems my young friend opposite 
has a long-term strategy

46:07.960 --> 46:10.390
to destroy the very nation that spawned him.

46:13.760 --> 46:19.190
While I was in Virginia losing my 
fingers in battle with the Americans,

46:19.360 --> 46:22.900
he was busy appeasing them.

46:23.080 --> 46:29.030
Now he would hand over the riches o
f the Indies to the bloody French!

46:35.040 --> 46:40.950
If... If we didn't have slaves, 
there would be no plantations.

46:41.120 --> 46:46.670
And with no plantations, how 
would we fill the coffers of the king?

46:46.840 --> 46:51.590
Does my honourable friend

46:51.760 --> 46:55.670
really believe that if we left off the trade,

46:55.840 --> 47:01.270
the French wouldn't immediately 
step into our place and reap the rewards?

47:12.480 --> 47:15.830
All this food. There's only a 
handful of people in there.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.910
He's an optimist. Completely incurable.

47:19.080 --> 47:22.390
Our defeat in the House 
today was not unexpected.

47:22.560 --> 47:25.020
But our intention was to 
flush out the opposition

47:25.200 --> 47:27.870
and discover how many people
 would support us.

47:28.040 --> 47:30.990
Yes, well, we certainly found 
out who our friends are.

47:31.160 --> 47:33.230
All 16 of them.

47:33.400 --> 47:37.180
I... I sent a note of thanks 
to everyone who voted for us.

47:37.360 --> 47:39.150
How sweet of you.

47:39.320 --> 47:41.700
Some of us know how to take defeat graciously.

47:41.880 --> 47:45.950
- Something to with with breeding?
- On this occasion, it probably is.

47:46.120 --> 47:50.150
Everything that is said at this 
meeting is being taken down for our records.

47:50.320 --> 47:53.070
My friend James Stephen has 
agreed to be our secretary.

47:53.240 --> 47:54.350
You were saying?

47:56.440 --> 48:01.710
As you can see, not many MPs 
have responded to our invitation.

48:01.880 --> 48:05.500
Indeed, outside my own family, 
there is only one: Sir William Dolben.

48:05.680 --> 48:08.350
Sir William, what brings 
you to this gathering?

48:10.120 --> 48:16.110
I recently took passage from 
Sierra Leone aboard a slave ship.

48:16.280 --> 48:19.350
What I saw during those 15 days...

48:21.280 --> 48:25.350
But I believe there are plenty of 
others in the House who share your feelings.

48:25.520 --> 48:28.080
- They're just afraid to show it.
- Shame on them!

48:28.240 --> 48:32.830
No shame. No shame. Were I 
the representative of a port city,

48:33.000 --> 48:38.070
how could I tell those whom I represent 
that I'm voting to end their livelihood?

48:38.240 --> 48:40.590
Exactly so.

48:40.760 --> 48:43.060
How can human beings be commerce?

48:43.240 --> 48:48.550
- It's exactly this pursuit of lofty...
- Nothing lofty about simple humanity.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.710
Please!

48:56.360 --> 49:00.270
Perhaps we should begin this 
journey with the first step.

49:00.440 --> 49:03.750
We are talking about the truth.

49:03.920 --> 49:07.950
So we should hand it out to people.
Drop it from church roofs.

49:08.120 --> 49:12.870
Paint pictures of it. Write songs about it. 
Make bloody pies out of it.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.870
Go on.

49:15.040 --> 49:17.870
There is a slave ship at dock in Tilbury

49:18.040 --> 49:20.390
with twice the slave berths it is insured for.

49:20.560 --> 49:24.340
I know that for a fact.
But how do we prove it?

49:24.520 --> 49:25.710
Wilber.

49:28.960 --> 49:31.340
- Dear God.
- Well, almost.

49:36.440 --> 49:42.030
I've spent 18 months being torn apart 
by you in the House, Mr Wilberforce.

49:42.200 --> 49:46.190
I thought I'd find out what it feels 
like to be on your side.

49:47.560 --> 49:52.150
I see you've got plenty of food.
Any of you saints drink?

49:58.680 --> 50:01.060
Well, this one bloody does.

50:07.520 --> 50:09.550
Thank you very much.

50:19.960 --> 50:21.670
Agh!

50:21.840 --> 50:25.070
Not fair! Not fair.

50:26.560 --> 50:28.830
I'm not well. My belly.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.380
What's wrong with your belly?

50:33.160 --> 50:34.910
Oh!

50:35.080 --> 50:37.950
Besides, you're prime minister.

50:38.120 --> 50:40.150
It is my ministerial duty to let you win.

50:40.320 --> 50:43.830
So, what will we do with Fox?

50:45.320 --> 50:48.860
- Put him in a box?
- Let him throw the heavy rocks.

50:49.040 --> 50:53.110
- Provide the shocks.
- Put Lord Tarleton in the stocks.

50:55.480 --> 50:57.510
Oh!

50:57.680 --> 51:00.870
Oh, if the House of Lords could hear 
the idiotic way we carry on,

51:01.040 --> 51:04.710
they'd ban anyone under the age of 30 
from holding high office ever again.

51:04.880 --> 51:10.550
Well, at least with Fox on board, 
the world will know we mean business.

51:10.720 --> 51:13.390
The world doesn't know yet.

51:14.160 --> 51:17.350
Nor will it, not until we're ready.

51:18.880 --> 51:21.950
You were born for this, Wilber.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.110
Sometimes I get giddy.

51:26.720 --> 51:31.310
Why is it you only feel the thorns 
in your feet when you stop running?

51:31.480 --> 51:35.100
Is that some sort of heavy-handed 
metaphorical advice for me, Mr Pitt?

51:35.280 --> 51:37.390
Yes, I suppose it is.

51:37.560 --> 51:42.230
We must keep going, keep going fast.

52:18.560 --> 52:19.750
Thank you very much.

52:43.800 --> 52:47.390
Gentlemen, would you stop the music, 
please? Thank you.

52:47.560 --> 52:52.710
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you have 
enjoyed our little tour of the estuary.

52:52.880 --> 52:57.270
But now our sojourn is almost over, 
I have a confession to make.

52:57.440 --> 53:00.910
This trip wasn't purely arranged 
to reward those MPs

53:01.080 --> 53:06.790
who have supported me in the past year, 
nor am I the only sponsor.

53:10.040 --> 53:12.070
- What's he doing?
- Ladies and gentleman,

53:12.240 --> 53:16.430
<i>this is a slave ship. The Madagascar.</i>

53:17.920 --> 53:19.910
It has just returned from the Indies

53:20.080 --> 53:25.950
where it delivered 200 men, women and children to Jamaica.

53:26.120 --> 53:31.390
When it left Africa, there were 600 on board.

53:32.960 --> 53:36.500
The rest died of disease or despair.

53:39.600 --> 53:43.830
That smell is the smell of death.

53:44.960 --> 53:47.670
Slow, painful death.

53:49.800 --> 53:53.580
Breathe it in. Breathe it deeply.

53:55.080 --> 53:58.590
Take those handkerchiefs away from your noses.

53:59.600 --> 54:01.790
There, now.

54:03.120 --> 54:06.030
Remember that smell.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.760
<i>Remember the Madagascar.</i>

54:08.920 --> 54:13.070
Remember that God made men equal.

54:17.840 --> 54:20.950
<i>All that winter, 
we spread out across the country</i>

54:21.120 --> 54:23.350
<i>gathering evidence for Parliament.</i>

54:23.520 --> 54:26.870
Thomas rode to Bristol, Liverpool, Plymouth,

54:27.040 --> 54:29.470
<i>talking to men who'd worked the slave ships,</i>

54:29.640 --> 54:32.200
<i>ships' doctors who'd treated them,</i>

54:32.360 --> 54:35.310
<i>slaves themselves who'd been whipped and branded.</i>

54:36.400 --> 54:40.310
Equiano published his account of his years as a slave.

54:43.440 --> 54:46.000
<i>He sold 50,000 copies in two months.</i>

54:55.200 --> 54:57.110
Spare a coin, sir?

54:57.280 --> 55:02.630
<i>Our supporters began to only buy sugar 
produced without slaves in India.</i>

55:03.520 --> 55:06.990
Or they stopped using sugar altogether.

55:07.160 --> 55:09.070
It seemed our message was everywhere.

55:09.240 --> 55:13.350
At least now there was hope. Real hope.

55:14.520 --> 55:17.030
We had a year to collect enough evidence

55:17.200 --> 55:20.550
to convince Parliament of our case.

55:20.720 --> 55:24.910
The planters and the ship owners 
began to spread rumours about us.

55:25.080 --> 55:29.670
They called us seditious, 
secretly working to bring down the government.

55:29.840 --> 55:32.430
Clarkson sat in a coach to Birmingham

55:32.600 --> 55:36.590
and overheard someone claim that 
I'd secretly married a slave woman.

55:42.760 --> 55:48.110
But the weight of our hope made 
it all seem like glorious infamy.

55:48.280 --> 55:51.270
How long have you been taking laudanum?

55:54.560 --> 55:57.150
I recognise its presence.

56:05.280 --> 56:10.110
My illness and my crusade were 
born around the same time.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.430
What is your illness?

56:13.400 --> 56:16.270
The doctors tell me it's called colitis.

56:16.440 --> 56:19.630
They don't really understand it, but I do.

56:19.800 --> 56:21.950
You see, sometimes my stomach

56:22.120 --> 56:25.230
gets bored of being a stomach 
and decides it's a sailing ship.

56:25.400 --> 56:28.790
Then my heart gets jealous and 
decides it wants to be a see-saw.

56:28.960 --> 56:31.870
And before you know it, 
my lungs are arguing with one another

56:32.040 --> 56:34.420
whether to be lungs or sponges full of seawater.

56:36.840 --> 56:40.910
Well, at least that's what 
I tell my nieces and nephews.

56:41.080 --> 56:43.150
Marianne tells me you like children.

56:46.720 --> 56:48.710
My poor father almost went mad

56:48.880 --> 56:51.670
when I told him I'd stopped 
taking sugar in my tea.

56:53.080 --> 56:56.270
I was 14,

56:56.440 --> 56:59.430
reading your name in the papers, 
willing you to win.

57:00.640 --> 57:06.110
I told my friends there was actual 
slave blood in every lump of sugar.

57:12.240 --> 57:14.540
Has this been so painful to talk about?

57:15.680 --> 57:19.830
It's only painful to talk about 
because we haven't changed anything.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.430
But, unlike the slaves, 
I have opium for my pain.

57:25.050 --> 57:26.360
Begging your pardon, sir.

57:28.730 --> 57:31.360
I thought everyone was in bed.

57:31.530 --> 57:34.440
She brings the breakfasts.
What time is it?

57:34.610 --> 57:35.920
Does it matter?

57:50.250 --> 57:53.560
That year we should have won.

57:53.730 --> 57:58.320
With the evidence we had collected, 
by natural justice we should have won.

58:00.250 --> 58:04.160
Winds blow ships from Africa 
to the Indies naturally,

58:04.330 --> 58:07.320
as if the route were blessed by God.

58:08.530 --> 58:11.160
Another argument in defence of the trade

58:11.330 --> 58:17.280
is that the Newfoundland fishing 
industry is kept afloat

58:17.450 --> 58:22.000
by the fact that slaves in the West Indies

58:22.170 --> 58:25.640
consume that part of the fish

58:25.810 --> 58:29.160
which is fit for no other consumption.

58:31.010 --> 58:33.200
I do feel that if my honourable friend

58:33.370 --> 58:37.680
continues to scrape the bottom 
of the barrel for objections,

58:37.850 --> 58:40.880
he is in danger of getting 
splinters under his fingernails.

58:43.090 --> 58:45.440
Now, if I may continue with my argument...

58:45.610 --> 58:49.000
As representative of the great and flourishing

58:49.170 --> 58:51.160
commercial town of Liverpool,

58:51.330 --> 58:56.520
I must once again remind the House 
that we have no evidence

58:56.690 --> 59:00.720
that the Africans themselves
 have any objection to the trade.

59:05.290 --> 59:10.410
I have here an account written by a... 
Mr Clutterbuck...

59:11.730 --> 59:15.040
...which states that most slaves in the Indies

59:15.210 --> 59:18.560
have a snug little garden with 
plenty of pigs and poultry.

59:20.130 --> 59:25.600
There are many poor families 
in Liverpool who do not have as much.

59:26.810 --> 59:29.240
Which... Which is why,

59:29.410 --> 59:34.720
apart from a few mendicant 
physicians and itinerant clergymen,

59:34.890 --> 59:38.320
the ordinary people of 
Britain are not at all exercised

59:38.490 --> 59:42.600
by the whole issue of slavery.

59:42.770 --> 59:45.150
My honourable friend, the member for Liverpool,

59:45.330 --> 59:47.920
seeks evidence of people's concern.

59:48.090 --> 59:52.280
In the past year, I and my 
itinerant clergymen friends

59:52.450 --> 59:54.680
have been gathering just such evidence.

59:56.650 --> 01:00:01.360
We have taken a petition calling 
for the abolition of the slave trade

01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:04.480
to all the great cities of this country.

01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:10.960
It has been signed by over 390,000 people.

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:23.320
However, this petition is not yet complete.

01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:27.600
There is one more person who wishes 
to add his name.

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:41.190
Do something.

01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:48.040
Mr Speaker, I humbly request a suspension

01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:51.720
while we take time to examine the 
signatures on this document.

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:55.320
There is something very provoking

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:58.080
in the calm way my honourable 
friend seeks delay.

01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:02.840
- Mr Speaker, will he not give way?
- Is the desolation of Africa suspended?

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:05.720
- Please, gentlemen.
- Is the work of death suspended?

01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:09.080
- You bring petitions into the House...
- Mr Speaker...

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:13.280
...as if this country should be 
governed by the rule of the mob,

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:16.520
- rather than its natural rulers!
- Order!

01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:19.250
That roll of paper reeks of rebellion!

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:23.520
No matter how loud you shout, 
you will not drown out the voice of the people!

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:28.400
The people?

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:36.920
This session will be suspended 
while the petition is examined.

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:42.320
Wilber.

01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:11.240
My spies tell me that Tarleton and Coconut Clarence

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:13.160
have gone to see the Home Secretary.

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:19.800
- What would they want with Lord Dundas?
- He's one of ours, isn't he?

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:22.680
James. James.

01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:28.160
- Where does Lord Dundas stand?
- Probable, I think.

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:31.080
We have him down as a probable.

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:34.840
Last year he stopped the deportation 
of a Jamaican slave from Scotland,

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:38.320
- so his heart's in the right place.
- Be wary of Dundas.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:45.440
If he's capable of compassion once, why not twice?

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:49.480
What damage could he do if he's turned?

01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:54.440
He controls the Scottish vote, 34 MPs.

01:02:57.850 --> 01:02:59.920
We'll have to have faith in his integrity.

01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:04.920
Integrity?

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:12.470
Where are you going?

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:16.910
<i>To look up the word "integrity"
in Dr Johnson's Dictionary.</i>

01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:21.640
Come.

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:25.800
Prime Minister, Lord Charles Fox to see you.

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:33.040
You look more at home when doing
 something devious.

01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:40.120
Prime Minister, your friend 
Wilberforce doesn't play cards any more.

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:44.670
No. He resigned from all five card 
clubs when he saw the light.

01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:46.640
Pity. He was good.

01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:49.270
Well, I think there's a hand you 
should play for him.

01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:55.840
- Against whom?
- Someone who stands in his way.

01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:01.200
So name him.

01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:13.520
Good evening.

01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:26.880
Billy, did I not win enough money 
from you on Saturday evening?

01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:32.200
Really, I have no time for cards.
I have urgent business in the House.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:46.360
As prime minister, idle gossip collects 
around you like scum in slack water.

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:48.240
What have you heard?

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:51.240
Lord Tarleton's throwing East India Company money

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:54.080
at people who are speaking against abolition tonight.

01:04:55.570 --> 01:04:58.440
Of course, no true friend of mine 
would accept such an offer.

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.320
I appear to have three jacks.

01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:07.830
I've always ensured that you have 
been dealt a favourable hand.

01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:12.400
- Are you threatening me?
- You are threatening our friendship.

01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:16.800
It isn't money that has made me 
decide to oppose Wilberforce.

01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:18.840
His enemy is my enemy.

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:22.080
You are sleepwalking hand-in-hand with a bloody rebel.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:26.680
Wilberforce follows no leader but 
the preacher in his head.

01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:30.520
How much were you offered?

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:33.640
Keep yourjacks.

01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:38.520
The planters still have the king, 
and I, at least, am still loyal to him.

01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:42.440
Don't force me to put a pistol to your head.

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:47.720
Well, if you do, there will be two pistols,

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:50.680
one from each side.

01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:55.520
And perhaps if I duck, you'll shoot each other.

01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:10.320
Order.

01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:12.230
Order.

01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:18.280
First, let me be clear.

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:23.200
After long consideration and much consultation,

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:27.480
I am in favour of the abolition 
of the slave trade.

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:35.080
There's no doubt in my mind that 
this trade in human beings

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:40.920
is an almighty calumny and is a 
disgrace to this nation.

01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:47.000
However... I also take the point 
of my honourable friend,

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:49.200
the member for Liverpool.

01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:53.720
If we were to outlaw the trade tomorrow, 
it would bring financial disaster

01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:56.160
to many cities and industries in this country.

01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:04.160
I therefore suggest a period of reflection.

01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:07.560
After a year and a half of privy council investigations,

01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:09.920
what good would it do to delay the inevitable?

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:14.680
Inevitable? Is my honourable friend 
counting the votes before they are cast?

01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:17.480
I didn't mean that.

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:22.280
If the trade were to be abolished, 
I suggest that we do so gradually.

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:26.640
Violent storms sink ships.

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:31.440
This great ship of state must not be sunk

01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:33.840
by a wave of good intentions.

01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:01.150
They are cleverer than us, Thomas.

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:04.320
And yet...

01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:09.090
...outside the House of Commons, the mood is with us.

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:13.080
And what good is that?

01:08:13.930 --> 01:08:16.520
I have friends in France.

01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:22.840
Our counterparts.
Men of principle, like you and I.

01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:26.630
- They bring me only good news.
- News of what?

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:30.040
Revolution.

01:08:31.050 --> 01:08:32.600
They're certain it's coming.

01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:38.040
In Paris they speak openly 
in the streets of emancipation.

01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:40.640
Freedom for all men, and women too.

01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:47.029
The Americans pulled the cork 
out of the bottle, Wilberforce.

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:49.000
Now the French share the wine.

01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:51.920
You talk about revolution as if it were a safe thing.

01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:53.640
It's just a word.

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:57.279
Every day we change things, by degrees.
Education, factories.

01:08:57.450 --> 01:09:00.990
By degrees.
You sound like Dundas! Gradually.

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.470
An imperfect order's better than no order.

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:06.160
We must fight for a perfect order!

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.920
I've pledged an allegiance to the king.

01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:19.840
You know as well as I do...
the king is insane.

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:22.359
He shakes hands with oak trees

01:09:22.529 --> 01:09:25.160
and claims he can see Germany through his telescope.

01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:33.560
I know you have your loyalties, Wilberforce,

01:09:33.729 --> 01:09:38.279
but underneath it you're more radical than any of us.

01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:40.800
You see, you never doubt you're right.

01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:47.640
What we say of the slave is true of the worker in the field,

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:50.240
the weaver, the miner.

01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:53.920
Shouldn't they be free to prosper too,

01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:58.360
instead of the fruits of their 
labours going to men like Tarleton?

01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:03.320
Men who spend their money on whores and comic operas.

01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:09.190
Young girls debauched.

01:10:12.690 --> 01:10:15.960
Soldiers forced to beg.

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:22.080
It's a natural wave that's flowing, Wilber.

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:26.800
First Boston, then Paris.

01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:28.760
Next London.

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:30.920
Thomas...

01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:36.230
...you must never speak of revolution 
in my presence ever again.

01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:51.960
I'm going to Paris to see for myself.

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:58.950
Why don't you come with me?

01:11:00.610 --> 01:11:02.800
Drink some of that wine?

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:20.240
Africa, your sufferings have been a theme

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:23.760
that has engaged and arrested my heart.

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:27.590
Your sufferings...

01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:33.080
...no tongue can express, no language impart.

01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:36.200
Agh!

01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:45.560
God has set before me two great objects:

01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:50.120
The suppression of the slave trade

01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:52.720
and the reformation of society.

01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:56.210
Agh! Agh!

01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:05.960
Sir!

01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:07.880
Marjorie.

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:13.920
The trouble is, Doctor, he doesn't believe he has a body.

01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:17.280
Utterly careless of it. He, um...

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:19.880
He thinks he's a disembodied spirit.

01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:27.080
Perhaps you should spend some time away from London.

01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:29.880
- What's this?
- Laudanum, for the pain.

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:32.800
An opiate? No, no, no.
I need my mind sharp.

01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:34.760
You need to rest.

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:38.080
My bill is before the House in three weeks.

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:41.640
- Would you leave us a moment, Doctor?
- Yes, Prime Minister.

01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:51.400
It's now five years since you first 
brought this bill to the House.

01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:54.080
And each time we get a little closer.

01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:59.040
Wilberforce, there are other MPs 
who could carry the debate.

01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:01.770
Who? Name one.

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:06.590
The only man I would trust is you.

01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:12.230
Well?

01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:14.280
I can't be seen to openly oppose the king

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:16.560
when the streets of Paris run with blood.

01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:19.110
You've read too many lurid newspaper articles.

01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:22.520
The French Republic plans to declare war within the year.

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:26.120
- On who?
- On who?

01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:31.200
You're locked inside your own head! 
Us, Great Britain, everything we stand for!

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:37.920
Considering the situation, 
you mix with the wrong people.

01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:43.280
- Who do I mix with?
- Clarkson, for one.

01:13:43.450 --> 01:13:47.680
- Who introduced me to Clarkson?
- In different times.

01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:54.750
They say in the cafés that Clarkson's a French spy.

01:13:56.050 --> 01:14:00.760
And Equiano, they say he was born in Carolina,

01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:04.800
and as an American, 
therefore must be a revolutionary.

01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:12.480
Others say they've seen with their own eyes

01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:16.160
letters addressed to you from Thomas Jefferson.

01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:20.080
- On matters to do with abolition.
- War changes everything.

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:22.760
- Even friendships?
- Especially those!

01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:27.120
So you will keep your precious conscience intact

01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:29.750
and let the rest of us do the war's dirty work.

01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:33.800
Conscience is indeed precious.

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.000
I am warning you as your prime minister

01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:40.040
that when war comes, 
opposition will soon be called sedition!

01:14:41.850 --> 01:14:43.120
By who?

01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:49.120
By you?

01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:15.960
This evening I would like to
 return to the theme of abolition.

01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:22.400
In these dangerous times, 
it is easy to put aside our concerns for those in need

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:25.320
simply to confirm our loyalty to the nation.

01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:31.560
But the issues of war and the 
issues of slavery must not be confused.

01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:34.520
Our fear of an unknown enemy must not be allowed

01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:36.760
to erode our long-cherished liberties.

01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:41.040
If this is to happen, how bitter will our history be?

01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:49.600
We must not prohibit all political 
discussion of political subjects.

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:52.880
The issue of slavery is not made any less important

01:15:53.050 --> 01:15:55.160
by the unrelated issues of war!

01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:59.880
In war or in peace, the buying and selling of human beings

01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:02.840
is equally abhorrent!

01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:05.840
This is not a seditious statement!

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:26.360
Where is your laudanum?
I'll prepare it for you.

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:29.920
No. No, I want to tell you how it ends.

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:34.000
I already know.
Your bills were easily defeated.

01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:40.480
Equiano... died in his bed.

01:16:40.650 --> 01:16:44.400
Thomas Clarkson found a cottage 
in the hills to hide away in.

01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:49.510
Charles Fox watched and waited.

01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:54.160
The Quakers still sent their letters.
No one replied.

01:16:56.290 --> 01:16:58.320
Is that the end of your story?

01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:01.760
- You think not?
- No.

01:17:01.930 --> 01:17:05.960
- Why not?
- Because after night comes day.

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:10.990
The people aren't so afraid now the 
war with France is being won.

01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:15.400
And when they stop being afraid, 
they rediscover their compassion.

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:19.480
So the people have their compassion back.

01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:21.760
And you still have passion.

01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:25.840
That matters more.

01:17:41.730 --> 01:17:44.640
- Good morning, Wilber.
- Morning.

01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:47.320
- Get much sleep?
- Not much.

01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:50.080
- What time did Barbara leave?
- Late.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:53.360
I mean, early.

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:57.610
I'm afraid I'm going back to London.

01:17:58.370 --> 01:18:00.120
- So soon?
- Yes.

01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:02.560
I think the waters worked their magic on me.

01:18:03.690 --> 01:18:06.070
But I need to send a letter to James Stephen.

01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:09.080
- To ask him to come back to England.
- For what reason?

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.710
To put his evidence before a select committee.

01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:17.320
Also, Barbara and I have discovered

01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:21.680
that we're both impatient 
and prone to rash decisions.

01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:25.520
But she wants to tell you about it herself.

01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:03.320
Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin,

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:07.520
we will sing the hymn requested by the bride.

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:16.990
<i># Amazing Grace</i>

01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:20.710
<i># How sweet the sound</i>

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:26.600
<i># That saved a wretch like me</i>

01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:30.440
<i># I once was lost</i>

01:19:30.610 --> 01:19:34.600
<i># But now am found</i>

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:40.000
<i># Was blind but now I see...</i>

01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:48.080
- Delightful service.
- Thank you so much for coming.

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:51.720
Thank you.
How are you coping with the new kitchen?

01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:54.350
"Great changes are easier than small ones."

01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:56.880
- Francis Bacon.
- Well done.

01:19:59.450 --> 01:20:01.440
- Have you forgiven us yet?
- Never.

01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:04.480
It'll be wonderful to have you both living so near.

01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:05.750
Thank you.

01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:08.880
I do hope you didn't come to Clapham for the tranquillity.

01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:12.320
- We're very noisy neighbours.
- I'm counting on it.

01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:29.040
Barbara.

01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:34.520
- You have my deepest condolences.
- Thank you so much.

01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:40.440
But please, I beg of you, do this for me. 
Make him eat some of his pets.

01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:44.520
- Oh, I rather like them.
- I like them too. In brandy sauce.

01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:55.160
- If you'll excuse me...
- There's no need, Barbara.

01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:57.560
You're discussing politics with your eyes.

01:20:57.730 --> 01:21:00.360
You may as well do it with your mouths.

01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:13.960
I, uh... didn't think you'd invite me.

01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:16.430
Didn't think you'd come.

01:21:19.690 --> 01:21:22.560
- You well?
- My mind's well.

01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:25.750
The rest of me is fraying at the edges.

01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:31.750
Billy, I'm going to try again.

01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:34.390
Well?

01:21:34.450 --> 01:21:37.800
It's your wedding day.
I agree with everything you say.

01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:40.080
I never changed.

01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:43.040
- I don't change.
- Well, hurrah for you.

01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:47.600
The mood may even be swinging back in your favour.

01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:54.730
How can we live in houses like
 this when others are living in boxes?

01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:56.920
Is that still sedition?

01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:01.080
As your prime minister, I urge caution.

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:06.040
- And as my friend?
- Oh, to hell with caution.

01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:10.960
When the slaves are flogged on the wharfs,

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:16.280
their arms are tied to a hook on a crane

01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:21.000
and weights of 56 pounds

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:24.560
applied to their feet.

01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:28.840
The crane is raised

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:34.200
so that their feet barely touch the ground.

01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:37.040
The slaves are then whipped

01:22:37.210 --> 01:22:39.800
with ebony bushes, comma...

01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:48.120
...to let out the congealing blood.

01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:51.360
I don't hear the nib scratching the page.

01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:52.750
We have company, sir.

01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:57.680
John, it's me, Wilber.

01:23:01.690 --> 01:23:02.790
Leave it.

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:15.710
They only told me your sight was fading.

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:18.680
Well, now it's faded altogether.

01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:22.390
I never did things by halves.
God decided I'd seen enough.

01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:25.600
- So it's true.
- What's true?

01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:29.760
- You're writing your account.
- Uh-huh.

01:23:31.770 --> 01:23:33.960
I wish I could see your face.

01:23:37.290 --> 01:23:40.080
- How are you looking?
- The same.

01:23:40.890 --> 01:23:44.160
- Still too thin.
- A little fatter lately.

01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:47.040
She feeds you well then, this wife of yours?

01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:50.830
- She's given me an appetite.
- An appetite to change things?

01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:04.040
This is my confession.

01:24:04.210 --> 01:24:06.200
You must use it.

01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:11.560
Names, ships' records,

01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:14.080
ports, people.

01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:17.920
Everything I remember is in here.

01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:20.440
Although my memory is fading,

01:24:20.610 --> 01:24:23.680
I remember two things very clearly:

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:27.720
I'm a great sinner and Christ is a great saviour.

01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:31.360
You must publish it.

01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:35.560
Blow a hole in their boat with it.
Damn them with it!

01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:40.920
I wish I could remember all their names.

01:24:42.450 --> 01:24:46.600
My 20,000 ghosts,

01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:49.360
they all had names.

01:24:49.530 --> 01:24:52.840
Beautiful African names.

01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:58.040
We called them with just grunts.

01:24:58.210 --> 01:25:00.200
Noises.

01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:05.400
We were apes. They were human.

01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:15.840
I'm weeping.

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:22.080
I couldn't weep till I wrote this.

01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:31.800
"I once was blind, but now I see."

01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:34.000
Didn't I write that too?

01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:36.600
Yes, you did.

01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:39.640
Well, now at last it's true.

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:43.800
Now go, Wilber. Go.

01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:47.640
We have lots of work to do, you and I.

01:25:55.890 --> 01:25:59.960
"Strange treasures in this fair world appear,

01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:05.520
strange all and new to me."

01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:09.640
That is a poem by Thomas Traherne,

01:26:09.810 --> 01:26:12.440
and I have absolutely no idea what it's about.

01:26:12.610 --> 01:26:15.280
But when I was small, 
I was made to learn it by heart,

01:26:15.450 --> 01:26:17.720
so I don't see why you shouldn't suffer too.

01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:22.600
Clarkson! Clarkson!

01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:25.360
Good God, he's got his voice back.

01:26:25.530 --> 01:26:27.640
We need you back in London straightaway!

01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:29.800
Oh.

01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:33.960
Bollocks.

01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:36.320
Hurry up, come on.

01:26:53.650 --> 01:26:54.760
Wilber!

01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:03.990
- You look fine. Fine.
- I look wet and feeble.

01:27:04.170 --> 01:27:08.440
You, however, look disgustingly 
like a lusty adventurer from a storybook.

01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:13.280
Come on. I've got a coach. 
The others are waiting for us at Palace Yard.

01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:16.480
- Don't I get to wash or sleep?
- Sleep?

01:27:16.650 --> 01:27:18.680
You haven't changed at all, William.

01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:35.750
I called this meeting to welcome 
back James Stephen from the Indies.

01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:37.920
But he should speak for himself.

01:27:39.330 --> 01:27:41.960
I have here diagrams,

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:45.880
first-hand accounts and transcripts of trials

01:27:46.050 --> 01:27:50.840
where innocent Africans have been 
convicted of crimes they did not commit

01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:52.880
and were then burnt alive.

01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:57.040
There are pages and pages and pages

01:27:57.210 --> 01:28:01.680
of first-hand accounts and figures and statistics.

01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:04.560
On every island now, there are rebellions.

01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:06.880
Haiti is in the hands of slaves.

01:28:07.050 --> 01:28:10.560
And the slaves are anxious.
They're impatient for their freedom.

01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:12.640
They hear about your work here.

01:28:14.490 --> 01:28:17.720
I saw a woman and her child being beaten...

01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:21.880
...in a coffee field.

01:28:22.050 --> 01:28:24.430
Afterwards, I heard the woman tell her daughter

01:28:24.610 --> 01:28:27.600
that someone was coming across the sea to save them.

01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:31.920
She said it was King Wilberforce.

01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:41.160
So this time, gentlemen, we must not fail them.

01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:50.110
What is it, James?

01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:55.400
- This is not a game for them.
- We know that.

01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:58.360
What I mean is, it's not enough.

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:05.330
If we go to Parliament with this evidence,

01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:07.840
there'll be sympathy, there'll be concern,

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:11.630
but it'll be just the same as every other time.

01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:14.080
Have you come back to preach hopelessness?

01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:18.200
No. No, I've had an idea.

01:29:18.370 --> 01:29:21.120
In my law books I might have stumbled across something

01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:23.720
and I want to propose it as a strategy.

01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:26.960
<i>Nosus Decipio.</i>

01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:30.040
It's Latin.

01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:33.160
Loosely translated, it means...

01:29:35.130 --> 01:29:36.230
..."we cheat".

01:30:11.970 --> 01:30:13.520
Oh, God.

01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:22.080
I don't care how important this is.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.680
I'll finish my shot.

01:30:30.450 --> 01:30:32.120
Oh, for God's sakes, what is it?

01:30:32.290 --> 01:30:34.080
- We've decided...
- We think...

01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:39.240
We've decided not to bring forward an abolition bill.

01:30:39.410 --> 01:30:42.040
- No?
- Indeed not.

01:30:42.210 --> 01:30:46.480
We're going to address the issue of 
the use of neutral flags on cargo ships.

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:49.520
- How unutterably dull.
- Exactly.

01:30:49.690 --> 01:30:52.360
We're going to suggest that French cargo ships

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:54.880
sailing under the American flag of convenience

01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:56.800
be liable to seizure by privateers.

01:30:56.970 --> 01:31:00.080
Part of the war effort.

01:31:00.250 --> 01:31:02.600
Patriotism, all that.

01:31:02.770 --> 01:31:07.320
Since when have you been interested in the war effort, 
patriotism and all that?

01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:10.870
I'm not.

01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:16.310
So... I'll continue with my game?

01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:24.720
You don't see anything sinister in that measure?

01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:27.600
No.

01:31:29.290 --> 01:31:32.280
- Then neither will they.
- What the hell are you talking about?

01:31:34.130 --> 01:31:36.880
80 percent of all slave ships sailing to the Indies

01:31:37.050 --> 01:31:39.120
are flying the neutral American flag

01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:42.600
to prevent them from being boarded by privateers.

01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:45.520
If we pass a law removing that protection,

01:31:45.690 --> 01:31:48.320
no ship owner will allow his vessel
 to make the journey.

01:31:48.490 --> 01:31:51.680
This will only apply to French ships, 
not British.

01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:53.120
That's the beauty of it.

01:31:53.290 --> 01:31:58.080
Once any ship raises the American flag, 
by law it is neither French nor British.

01:31:58.250 --> 01:32:01.640
So our slave ships will be just 
as liable to seizure as French ones.

01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:04.760
The privateers won't care whose 
booty they're taking,

01:32:04.930 --> 01:32:07.310
as long as they're operating within the law.

01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:10.800
Without the protection of neutral flags,

01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:15.080
80 percent of the British slave
 trade will be finished overnight.

01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:16.800
Dear God.

01:32:16.970 --> 01:32:20.400
But Prime Minister, we need to...

01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:24.110
...tuck this bill away somewhere.

01:32:25.010 --> 01:32:27.920
Disguise it. Oh.

01:32:29.130 --> 01:32:31.690
I won't even get on my feet in the House.

01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:34.440
This would still fall short of abolition.

01:32:34.610 --> 01:32:38.880
With their profits cut, 
half the slavers will be bankrupt in two years.

01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:42.320
Then we'll pick off their MPs in the House one by one.

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:44.280
Whose idea was this?

01:32:45.970 --> 01:32:47.600
A lawyer.

01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:54.600
Anti-French bill which is also anti-slavery.

01:32:57.170 --> 01:33:00.400
Don't know why I didn't think of this any sooner.

01:33:04.090 --> 01:33:05.520
Oh...

01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:08.600
But we can't let anyone know 
that we're behind this.

01:33:08.770 --> 01:33:12.280
Instruct someone to put this 
bill forward who's seen as a patriot.

01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:13.800
We don't want any fuss.

01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:19.040
We just need someone really, 
really... boring.

01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:25.750
Typically, a French ship will change its registration

01:33:25.930 --> 01:33:31.320
to raise the American flag and 
pick up a cargo of sugar in Havana.

01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:34.960
It will then sail to Carolina

01:33:35.130 --> 01:33:39.360
or Virginia or Florida

01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:44.160
or New York City or even Boston.

01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:48.240
The cargo will then be unloaded onto a second ship

01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:52.600
carrying the American flag and set sail for France.

01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:58.920
As things stand, 
neither the Royal Navy nor licensed privateers

01:33:59.090 --> 01:34:02.560
have power to seize such a ship.

01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:04.720
My proposition is

01:34:04.890 --> 01:34:09.480
that all the ships flying the American flag

01:34:09.650 --> 01:34:11.920
be liable to search and seizure

01:34:12.090 --> 01:34:14.760
to put an end to this lamentable deceit

01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:16.920
on the part of the French

01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:19.320
and their Dutch and Spanish allies.

01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:23.560
Mr Speaker! I believe the abolitionists 
are coming at us at a side wind.

01:34:23.730 --> 01:34:27.600
A side wind? What kind of side wind?

01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:32.120
I'm not sure what kind of side wind.
I just know there's something going on.

01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:36.400
- The Jacobites are in.
- The Jacobites?

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:41.000
Really, I do think you might update 
your invective to reflect changing times.

01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:43.760
Am I too late to call for an adjournment?

01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:52.120
Of course you are.

01:34:54.930 --> 01:34:58.630
Now, will you let the honourable gentleman proceed?

01:34:58.810 --> 01:35:00.600
As I was saying...

01:35:02.370 --> 01:35:08.040
...my proposition is that all ships
 flying the American flag

01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:12.440
be liable to search and seizure to 
put an end to this lamentable deceit

01:35:12.610 --> 01:35:14.720
on the part of the French, Dutch and Spanish.

01:35:23.370 --> 01:35:25.750
- Jackson, get into the chamber.
- Right, sir.

01:35:25.930 --> 01:35:28.840
Camber, chamber! Move your arse!

01:35:29.010 --> 01:35:33.000
- What's going on?
- Just do it!

01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:03.400
Where the hell is everyone?

01:36:03.570 --> 01:36:07.350
Everybody's at the races in Epsom.
They were given free tickets.

01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:12.120
I saved one for you.
A free gift from William Wilberforce.

01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:22.390
Wilby?

01:36:26.010 --> 01:36:29.400
What on earth is happening?
The poor maids are terrified.

01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:33.800
- I'll bring your laudanum.
- No! No!

01:36:33.970 --> 01:36:37.400
I've poured it all away this morning.
Every drop.

01:36:37.570 --> 01:36:41.840
- Then I'll fetch more.
- No. I'm finished with it.

01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:44.880
I can't even feel the joy of this victory.

01:36:46.930 --> 01:36:49.560
This new baby will find me as myself.

01:36:51.610 --> 01:36:53.960
- What will be his name?
- Who says it's a boy?

01:36:54.130 --> 01:36:56.840
Just tell me some names.
Please, just keep talking.

01:36:57.010 --> 01:37:00.360
William, if it's a boy.
Emma, if it's a girl.

01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:03.360
It's... it's a boy. I'm sure of it.

01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:05.000
- How will he look?
- Sweet.

01:37:08.650 --> 01:37:13.000
He will be strong with curly hair, 
but dark, like yours.

01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:17.400
- He's inside you now.
- Yes, yes, he's inside.

01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:20.400
I can almost hear him.
He's singing to us.

01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:22.760
Yes, he will have a fine voice like you.

01:37:22.930 --> 01:37:25.040
Yes, yes, a strong voice.

01:37:25.210 --> 01:37:28.280
And you will play with him in the garden every morning.

01:37:28.450 --> 01:37:31.920
- Yes.
- And soon we'll have a girl and a boy.

01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:35.600
And a girl and a boy and...

01:37:47.850 --> 01:37:49.840
Wilby!

01:37:51.850 --> 01:37:54.000
Come quickly!

01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:57.120
Come on!

01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:13.960
Please leave us now.

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:28.440
They tell me you're improving, Billy.

01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:30.600
Bull.

01:38:38.930 --> 01:38:41.230
We cracked crowns, didn't we?

01:38:41.410 --> 01:38:45.520
- We left the heads intact.
- Because we're so pathetically English.

01:38:52.410 --> 01:38:57.560
- We have agreed on a succession.
- You're not gone yet.

01:38:57.730 --> 01:39:02.920
I will be replaced by Lord Granville as prime minister,

01:39:03.090 --> 01:39:07.480
and the foreign secretary will be Charles Fox.

01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:11.000
And Wilber,

01:39:11.170 --> 01:39:16.240
Fox has already secured a guarantee from the palace.

01:39:16.410 --> 01:39:20.400
They will remain neutral in the issue of the slave trade.

01:39:22.810 --> 01:39:27.640
Next time you will be pushing at an open door.

01:39:36.850 --> 01:39:38.760
I'm scared, Wilber.

01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:42.680
Of what?

01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:46.330
At this moment, I wish I had your faith.

01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:55.160
No more excuses now, Wilber.

01:39:58.370 --> 01:40:01.200
Finish them off.

01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:15.270
As you know, Equiano, I rarely drink.

01:40:15.450 --> 01:40:17.440
But today's an exception.

01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:22.710
Today we're drinking to victory.

01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:36.120
Wish you were...

01:40:37.090 --> 01:40:41.440
...here to see all this... unfolding.

01:40:44.690 --> 01:40:47.320
Just one more push.

01:40:49.730 --> 01:40:51.720
One more.

01:41:35.770 --> 01:41:39.470
I say to this House that there is now no reason

01:41:39.650 --> 01:41:43.160
why my bill should not be commended to the king.

01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:49.080
And I urge my honourable friends 
to vote once and for all

01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:51.810
for the abolition of the slave trade

01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:55.670
throughout His Majesty's empire.

01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:57.840
They're taking the vote!

01:42:10.570 --> 01:42:12.040
Here's the tally.

01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:53.070
Order!

01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:57.120
Order!

01:42:59.770 --> 01:43:04.120
On the Home and Foreign Slave Trade Act,

01:43:04.290 --> 01:43:08.560
the unamended bill calling for 
the abolition of the slave trade

01:43:08.730 --> 01:43:12.680
throughout the entire British Empire.

01:43:12.850 --> 01:43:16.000
No's to the left: 16.

01:43:16.170 --> 01:43:20.520
Ayes to the right: 283.

01:43:26.650 --> 01:43:32.480
I declare the bill of abolition 
of the slave trade to be passed.

01:43:45.730 --> 01:43:46.920
<i>Noblesse oblige.</i>

01:43:47.970 --> 01:43:50.120
What the bloody hell does that mean?

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:52.520
It means my nobility obliges me

01:43:52.690 --> 01:43:55.800
to recognise the virtue of an exceptional commoner.

01:44:02.610 --> 01:44:04.240
Order!

01:44:05.010 --> 01:44:07.000
Order!

01:44:19.890 --> 01:44:22.240
When people speak of great men,

01:44:22.410 --> 01:44:26.160
they think of men like Napoleon.

01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:29.000
Men of violence.

01:44:29.170 --> 01:44:32.160
Rarely do they think of peaceful men.

01:44:34.170 --> 01:44:36.440
But contrast the reception they'll receive

01:44:36.610 --> 01:44:39.640
when they return home from their battles.

01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:43.480
Napoleon will arrive in pomp and in power.

01:44:43.650 --> 01:44:47.680
A man who's achieved the very summit of earthly ambition.

01:44:48.610 --> 01:44:53.200
Yet his dreams will be haunted by the oppressions of war.

01:44:54.730 --> 01:44:56.440
William Wilberforce, however,

01:44:57.850 --> 01:44:59.760
will return to his family,

01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:03.450
lay his head on his pillow

01:45:03.610 --> 01:45:06.360
and remember

01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:09.640
the slave trade is no more.
