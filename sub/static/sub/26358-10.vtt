WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:05.005
What's in the box?

00:06.223 --> 00:07.398
Touché.OCHOA:
This is John Rogers

00:07.442 --> 00:09.096
from the Department of Justice.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.880
CALLEN:
Where's Mosley?She's off the grid.

00:10.923 --> 00:13.187
How about Hetty?I don't know where Hetty
is or what she's up to.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.666
Says he's gonna drown Hetty

00:14.710 --> 00:16.059
in her protective
moat of lies

00:16.103 --> 00:18.192
along with everybody else
involved in Mexico.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.889
I just hope your people have
their stories straight.

00:19.932 --> 00:23.110
This was a serious
international incident.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.981
Why were you in Mexico?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.591
You will be pleased to know

00:26.635 --> 00:29.072
that your strikingly
corroborative statements

00:29.116 --> 00:30.465
and EAD Mosley's insistence

00:30.508 --> 00:32.467
that she ordered you into Mexico
without informing

00:32.510 --> 00:34.643
anyone of the mission
ahead of time

00:34.686 --> 00:36.210
essentially exonerates
the rest of you.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.576
Greetings and salutations.

00:54.619 --> 00:57.057
Hands where I can see them,
pretty please.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.233
Very good. Keep
walking. Keep walking.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.887
That's right,
just get nice and cozy.

01:01.931 --> 01:05.108
We're all in this together.It's another gorgeous
day here in Los Angeles,

01:05.152 --> 01:07.328
and, frankly,

01:07.371 --> 01:09.547
I see no reason
why we can't keep it that way.

01:09.591 --> 01:12.115
Listen to what my friends
and I ask of you, and I swear

01:12.159 --> 01:15.031
no one gets hurt. Now, please,

01:15.075 --> 01:16.337
take out your cell phones

01:16.380 --> 01:18.295
nice and slowly and hand them

01:18.339 --> 01:19.949
to one of my associates.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.951
Right here. Thank you, sir.Thank you, thank you.

01:21.994 --> 01:24.823
Excellent. This is going
so well, wouldn't you say?

01:24.867 --> 01:26.042
I absolutely would.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.913
Next, lower yourselves
to the ground.

01:27.957 --> 01:29.306
Not too quickly, though.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.221
Wouldn't want anyone
to sprain a back

01:31.265 --> 01:33.136
or twist a knee.Oh, my goodness.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.398
Please, let me help you.

01:34.442 --> 01:38.141
There you are, ma'am.Oh. O-Okay. Thank you.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.708
My pleasure.

01:39.751 --> 01:42.145
Now, where is our manager?
Ah, there you are.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.842
Hop on up, please.

01:43.886 --> 01:46.367
Andrea. A pleasure.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.586
Would you mind terribly
opening up the back?

01:48.630 --> 01:49.631
Is that a question?

01:49.674 --> 01:52.808
That's entirely up to you.

01:56.116 --> 01:59.119
We're almost out of your hair,
I promise. Just sit tight.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.599
You, too.

02:07.779 --> 02:10.304
You've all been so cooperative
this morning.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.310
We good?We're good.

02:16.353 --> 02:19.008
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's been an absolute pleasure.

02:19.051 --> 02:21.793
And we hope this hasn't
inconvenienced you too much.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.621
But maybe gives you something
to talk about

02:23.665 --> 02:25.667
at the dinner table
this evening.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.195
♪

02:50.692 --> 02:53.129
KENSI: All right, let's see what
you have done with this place.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.913
DEEKS:
So excited to show you. Ready?

02:54.957 --> 02:57.481
KENSI:
Let's see. Ooh.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.484
Don't touch that!

03:00.528 --> 03:02.443
Oh, my gosh.

03:02.486 --> 03:04.575
Oh, my gosh. You finished it.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.142
I know. I...It's ready.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.492
Over the years, you had to
put up with a lot of talk,

03:08.536 --> 03:11.930
a lot of hot air, but, uh...A lot of hot air, yep.

03:11.974 --> 03:14.150
But I finally did it-- pulled
the trigger and I did it.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.239
You have a bar.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.459
And it's ready.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.157
Correction: wehave a bar.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.768
We have a bar.
And it is...
well, it's almost ready.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.422
What are you talking
about, it's almost ready?

03:25.466 --> 03:27.859
I mean, you have a golden
hammerhead shark on the wall.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.731
Oh, yeah. I saw that.
I had to have it.

03:29.774 --> 03:33.561
And you have this beautiful
red felt pool table.

03:33.604 --> 03:35.911
Well, they say that red felt
is the new black.

03:35.954 --> 03:40.220
Mm-hmm. And above all, you have
a vagabond living upstairs.

03:40.263 --> 03:41.743
Oh, you mean Callen? Yeah.Mm-hmm.

03:41.786 --> 03:44.180
He's agreed to bounce
for me on the weekends.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.313
Okay, so what's left?
You did it all.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.793
Well, I have got to think
of what to call it.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.230
Well, that's easy.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.622
Name writes itsel...Is it?

03:51.666 --> 03:53.276
Yeah, name writes itself.
What are you thinking?

03:53.320 --> 03:55.626
Well, I was actually
kind of nervous to tell you.

03:55.670 --> 03:56.932
You were nervous to tell me?I mean,

03:56.975 --> 03:58.194
just 'cause,
you know, it's a big deal.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.369
You got to put it
across the front.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.414
I was...Okay. I'm ready.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.459
You ready? Okay.Yes.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.853
Schmitty's.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.030
You know, 'cause Schmitty...
When I first bought it,

04:08.073 --> 04:09.858
I was like, "To Schmitty,"
and then we all, like, cheers.Right.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.599
And it was this beautiful
moment of, like...Yeah, I remember.

04:11.642 --> 04:14.732
Yeah. Yeah.
Anyway, it's just...Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:17.518 --> 04:20.608
Wasn't... I wasn't...
You know, wasn't sold on that.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.958
Do you have a backup?Yeah, no, I got a backup.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.961
I got a... Um, I was thinking,

04:26.004 --> 04:29.356
also, that I could
call it... Monty's.

04:31.401 --> 04:34.186
'Cause my dog.Do you have a backup
to the backup?

04:34.230 --> 04:37.320
A second backup.
So, like, a third choice.Yeah. Mm-hmm.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.409
What would you... what
would you do if you just...

04:39.453 --> 04:43.979
Um, I was also considering...

04:44.022 --> 04:46.155
Roberta's.

04:46.198 --> 04:48.940
R-Roberta's. Roberta's,
'cause my mom's...

04:48.984 --> 04:50.986
Like-like Mama D. Yeah.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.683
It's pretty.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.250
Pretty, yeah?
You know what,
though? We don't...

04:54.294 --> 04:56.731
No, we don't have to rush. We
don't have to rush, sweetie.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.863
We can just... we can...
we can brainstorm.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.649
We don't have to open it now.S-So, you-you hate
all those, huh?

05:01.692 --> 05:04.260
No. It's just, we can just...

05:04.304 --> 05:06.262
We can... It's okay.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.308
Slammin' Salmon?

05:15.315 --> 05:18.056
And... time.

05:19.754 --> 05:22.104
Sam, time.I heard you.

05:22.147 --> 05:24.106
What, you trying to
show me up or something?

05:24.149 --> 05:26.630
It's not always about you, G.Oh.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.676
That's interesting. So
sometimes it is about me, huh?

05:28.719 --> 05:30.547
You're hilarious.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.070
And you're still in
a plank. You know,

05:32.114 --> 05:33.245
if somebody walks in here,
I'm not gonna look so good.

05:33.289 --> 05:34.464
No one's stopping you.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.640
Uh, except before you do
whatever it is

05:36.684 --> 05:38.729
you were going to do,
we have a case.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.296
Oh, and just to be clear,

05:40.340 --> 05:43.125
it is the case and not me
who would be stopping you, so...

05:45.823 --> 05:47.869
You heard that, right?

05:47.912 --> 05:49.958
We have a case.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.352
Did you hear that?

05:52.395 --> 05:55.355
There is a case!

05:55.398 --> 05:57.531
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard you.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.403
Okay.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.279
What we got?

06:07.323 --> 06:10.326
Bank robbery this morning.
The Westwood branch

06:10.370 --> 06:12.023
of Trust National.Ooh.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.242
Do love a good heist.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.417
KENSI:
I'm sorry, what?Yeah, no, that's...

06:14.461 --> 06:15.897
When it's pretend,
I'm on my couch

06:15.940 --> 06:18.900
eating popcorn and
snuggling with Monty.Stop.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.162
In my Slanket.Stop.

06:20.205 --> 06:21.816
Sorry.
Thankfully,

06:21.859 --> 06:23.774
no casualties
or injuries were reported.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.211
How much cash
did the robbers make out with?

06:26.255 --> 06:28.997
That's the thing. They
didn't touch any of it.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.869
What they did do was detonate
an explosive device

06:31.913 --> 06:33.741
and steal one
of the security deposit boxes.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.133
I'm sorry, I'm a
little confused.

06:35.177 --> 06:36.526
Why are we investigating this?

06:36.570 --> 06:37.788
Isn't this FBI terrain?

06:37.832 --> 06:40.225
Uh, it is FBI terrain,

06:40.269 --> 06:43.446
but the security deposit box
belonged to a Veronica Stephens,

06:43.490 --> 06:45.535
a former
Naval Intelligence officer

06:45.579 --> 06:48.756
who now runs CCG,
a management consulting firm

06:48.799 --> 06:51.759
that still does defense contract
work for the Navy.

06:51.802 --> 06:54.109
The plot thickens.Indeed.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.459
Kens, Deeks, why don't you
check out the bank?

06:56.503 --> 06:58.635
Sam, what do you say
about going to Veronica Stephens

06:58.679 --> 07:01.812
and finding out
what's in that box?Let's do it.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.467
"What's in the box?
What's in the box?!"

07:04.511 --> 07:05.947
: Hey, remember
when you gave me that box?

07:05.990 --> 07:07.992
Whatever happened
to that thing, huh?

07:08.036 --> 07:09.646
You lost my box?No.

07:09.690 --> 07:10.821
What

07:10.865 --> 07:12.257
No, of course I know
where the box is.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.911
I was joking. That was a joke.
I was kidding.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.913
Of course I know where your box
is. Like I'm gonna lose the box?

07:15.957 --> 07:17.654
I mean, oh, my God.
Why would I ever...?

07:17.698 --> 07:20.352
Oh, my God.We'll find it.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.400
He doesn't know
where the box is.No, he has no idea.

07:26.402 --> 07:29.274
Casual Monday, gentlemen?Thought we had
this place sprayed.

07:29.318 --> 07:30.928
KENSI:
Special Prosecutor Rogers.

07:30.972 --> 07:32.539
What are you doing here?It has come to the attention

07:32.582 --> 07:34.715
of those in Washington
that this office requires

07:34.758 --> 07:36.586
some adult supervision.

07:36.630 --> 07:39.241
And perhaps a dress code.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.417
We were in the middle
of working out when we were

07:41.461 --> 07:44.246
called to a case.Working out

07:44.289 --> 07:46.074
Well, this is awkward.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.337
Strength and endurance isn't
required for pushing a pencil,

07:48.380 --> 07:50.426
but it is for being an agent.Uh-huh.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.906
And how many hours
would you estimate

07:51.949 --> 07:53.473
that you spend
in the gym each week?

07:53.516 --> 07:56.171
Why weren't we informed
that you were "visiting"

07:56.214 --> 07:57.433
Spoil the surprise?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.827
In addition
to a retroactive review

07:59.870 --> 08:01.524
of your past cases,
I will be observing

08:01.568 --> 08:03.700
and assessing the performance

08:03.744 --> 08:05.093
of this office.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.182
Hmm, I see.

08:07.225 --> 08:08.705
And how long you
planning on staying?

08:08.749 --> 08:11.142
Until further notice.
But I work fast.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.622
I should be gone by June.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.015
What?Yeah.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.278
Good luck out there.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.759
Excuse me, please.

08:20.891 --> 08:23.198
Well, this officially sucks.

08:39.083 --> 08:39.954
ANDREA:
I'm sorry.

08:39.997 --> 08:41.521
We're closed for business today.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.914
Actually, we're with NCIS.
I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye.

08:43.958 --> 08:46.438
This is my partner,
Detective Marty Deeks.Oh, sorry about that.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.571
Andrea Nelson, branch manager.

08:48.615 --> 08:51.966
That is, unless I'm fired over
what happened here this morning.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.272
Well, let's hope it
doesn't come to that.Can you take us in the back

08:54.316 --> 08:56.274
where the robbers stole
the, uh, safety deposit box?

08:56.318 --> 08:58.407
Of course. Follow me.Thank you so much.
Thank you.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.939
Oh.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.114
Oh, wow.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.029
Well, color me impressed.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.857
Did the explosion damage

09:13.901 --> 09:15.903
any of the other
security deposit boxes?No.

09:15.946 --> 09:18.079
I had each one examined
an hour ago,

09:18.122 --> 09:19.950
and the others
are all completely fine.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.910
Well, these guys obviously knew
exactly what they were doing.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.433
How long did it take
them to pull it off?

09:24.476 --> 09:26.435
They were in and out of here
in under three minutes.

09:26.478 --> 09:28.916
That's not even
enough time for LAPD to show up

09:28.959 --> 09:30.613
even if they didn't take
everybody's cell phones

09:30.657 --> 09:32.006
or if someone hit
the silent alarm.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.573
How about you?
Are you doing okay?

09:33.616 --> 09:35.923
Must have been
pretty scary for you.Oh, I was terrified.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.141
At least, at first.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.274
But they were so polite.

09:39.317 --> 09:42.364
I'm talking
extremely good manners.

09:42.407 --> 09:45.062
And it turns out there was
nothing to be afraid of, anyway.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.151
Why is that?

09:47.195 --> 09:49.240
Because before the robbers
took off,

09:49.284 --> 09:52.417
they left our cell phones
and their guns behind.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.204
LAPD just told me

09:56.247 --> 09:58.859
that the weapons were all fakes
made of plastic.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.383
And they didn't touch
any of the cash on hand?They didn't even

10:01.426 --> 10:03.254
take anything
from the teller registers.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.823
So, what's in that box?

10:11.872 --> 10:13.830
I'm gonna have an aneurysm

10:13.874 --> 10:16.703
if Rogers keeps showing up
at the office every day.

10:16.746 --> 10:19.227
You don't think that's
a little extreme?

10:19.270 --> 10:21.272
No. Not at all.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.361
We run a tight ship, G.
Nothing to worry about.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.189
We both know
Hetty gave us a long leash.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.800
And Granger knew how
to work the system

10:26.843 --> 10:28.192
to keep the bureaucrats
out of our hair.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.849
Yeah, well, maybe he'll
get bored and go home.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.895
Let's at least give
the guy a chance.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.505
Whose side are you on?

10:36.548 --> 10:37.854
It's not always
about you, G.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.117
Uh-huh.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.293
Good morning.
How may I help you?

10:42.337 --> 10:44.382
Agent Callen, Agent Hanna, NCIS.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.036
We're here
to see Veronica Stephens.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.604
Of course. She's expecting you.
Follow me.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.171
Hmm.

10:54.392 --> 10:58.092
Yes. Oh, right, of course.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.268
Right.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.965
Can I get you some water?

11:02.009 --> 11:03.488
We have still, sparkling,
room temp, iced,

11:03.532 --> 11:04.707
lemon, lime, or pink grapefruit.

11:04.751 --> 11:05.926
No. We're good, thanks.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.797
And I promise Capri is on the...

11:07.841 --> 11:09.364
is on the calendar.

11:09.407 --> 11:12.019
All right, we'll talk then.

11:12.062 --> 11:14.325
Mm-hmm. Bye-bye.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.023
God, I'm so sorry about that.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.502
Um, it's Bono.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.374
He's such a sweetheart,
but he's so hard

11:19.417 --> 11:21.158
to get off the phone.I've heard.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.291
I'm Agent Callen,
this is Agent Hanna.

11:23.334 --> 11:24.945
We're from NCIS.
Oh.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.555
Gosh. Is this about
what happened at the bank?

11:26.598 --> 11:27.774
God, I'm so sorry

11:27.817 --> 11:29.210
you guys have been dragged
into this.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.951
It's not a problem.Yes, but I'm
sure you have

11:30.994 --> 11:32.256
more important things
you can be doing.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.562
Well, as long as
we're already here,

11:33.605 --> 11:34.955
why don't you start
by telling us

11:34.998 --> 11:36.521
what you were keeping
in that safety deposit box?

11:36.565 --> 11:40.787
Ugh. Gosh, you know, I am...
I'm just so upset about it.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.789
You know, you put things
in the bank for safekeeping

11:42.832 --> 11:44.181
because you're worried that
something might happen to them

11:44.225 --> 11:46.531
at home, and meanwhile,

11:46.575 --> 11:49.360
it all would have been safer
under my mattress.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.232
What would have been safe
under your mattress

11:51.275 --> 11:53.930
My jewelry. Mm.

11:53.974 --> 11:56.454
I mean, the box
was filled

11:56.498 --> 11:58.892
with antiques that have been
in my family for generations.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.677
I don't even think any of it
was particularly valuable,

12:01.721 --> 12:04.636
but, uh, well, the pieces
meant something to me, and...

12:04.680 --> 12:06.508
and now they're gone.

12:06.551 --> 12:09.250
Makes me sad.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.121
I'm sorry.

12:11.165 --> 12:13.994
And the worst part of it is
just... I mean, I-I know

12:14.037 --> 12:16.083
how impossible it's gonna be
to get it all back.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.519
Might get lucky at one

12:17.562 --> 12:21.218
of these local pawnshops
or online auction like eBay.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.872
Yeah.

12:22.916 --> 12:25.309
I'm just sorry
you guys are involved.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.572
I mean, isn't this more
LAPD's job?

12:27.616 --> 12:30.184
Well, we're here in more
of an overlay capacity.

12:30.227 --> 12:32.708
So, do you have any idea
why you were targeted?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.144
I mean, do you have any enemies?

12:34.188 --> 12:36.016
You ever been threatened
by anyone?

12:36.059 --> 12:38.975
Excuse me. Claire?

12:40.847 --> 12:41.804
Claire!

12:41.848 --> 12:43.763
Ah.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.200
Agent Callen and Hanna
would like to know

12:46.243 --> 12:47.810
if I have any enemies.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.813
Oh. Should I bring
them the binder?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.510
I think you should bring them
the binder.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.165
Okay.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.610
What is this?

13:05.654 --> 13:09.571
That's the last 12 months.

13:09.614 --> 13:10.964
So you've been
keeping a record

13:11.007 --> 13:12.052
of all the people that
have been threatening you

13:12.095 --> 13:13.140
for the past 12 months?

13:13.183 --> 13:14.445
Well, let's just say

13:14.489 --> 13:16.447
it kind of goes
with the territory of the job.

13:18.710 --> 13:22.714
Mm. When you advise
on the impact of trade wars and

13:22.758 --> 13:26.283
make the economic argument
to combat climate change,

13:26.327 --> 13:27.807
you tend
to ruffle some feathers.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.330
Apparently.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.288
I mean, I'm only ever trying
to help,

13:31.332 --> 13:33.421
but always end up
pissing someone off.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.727
Any one of these people ever
follow through on a threat?

13:35.771 --> 13:39.122
Never. Always just a lot
of hot air.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.863
You mind if we take
this binder with us?

13:40.907 --> 13:42.256
No. Be my guest.

13:42.299 --> 13:46.129
We keep extra copies around
the office just in case.

13:46.173 --> 13:49.872
And because they're a
great read on a slow day.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.833
Wow. Okay.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.943
I'm not making you
nervous, am I?

14:16.986 --> 14:18.422
No, not at all.

14:18.466 --> 14:19.946
Are you sure?

14:19.989 --> 14:21.817
You know, it's fine,
'cause, um, you know,

14:21.861 --> 14:23.993
we have to keep this room
really cold because

14:24.037 --> 14:27.257
of all the electrical
equipment, and, um,

14:27.301 --> 14:31.392
because you insist
on sitting so very close to me,

14:31.435 --> 14:33.873
I'm kind of benefiting
from that, uh...

14:33.916 --> 14:35.135
that body heat of yours,

14:35.178 --> 14:38.225
so that's a... bonus.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.704
And also, you know,

14:39.748 --> 14:43.230
who am I to stop you
from choosing this chair

14:43.273 --> 14:44.971
as your favorite chair,

14:45.014 --> 14:48.365
out of all the chairs
in the building full of chairs,

14:48.409 --> 14:50.977
when this chair clearly belongs

14:51.020 --> 14:53.631
to my girlfriend
and coworker Nell Jones?

14:53.675 --> 14:55.416
It's fine.Well, all righty then.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.461
Because I'd really love
to start looking through

14:57.505 --> 14:58.941
your team's past cases,

14:58.985 --> 15:00.247
try to establish
patterns of behavior,

15:00.290 --> 15:01.988
calculate the property
damage incurred.

15:02.031 --> 15:04.904
Cool. Well,
look forward to that.

15:06.862 --> 15:09.038
You know,

15:09.082 --> 15:11.780
I dabble in I.T. myself.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.260
Around the office,

15:13.303 --> 15:16.045
whenever anyone has an
issue, I'm their guy.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.656
Oh, yeah, I-I don't...
I don't really do I.T.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.832
Well, you kind of do.

15:20.876 --> 15:23.966
Um, with all due respect,

15:24.010 --> 15:26.795
Special Prosecutor Rogers,
I know

15:26.838 --> 15:28.840
slightly more
than your average I.T. guy.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.973
Exactly.
Yeah.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.106
No, I was being modest.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.890
Why?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.979
Because no one likes
a braggart.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.633
Why?

15:38.676 --> 15:42.115
Because it's not looked upon
favorably by society.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.812
Why?

15:45.074 --> 15:47.294
Eric, Eric,

15:47.337 --> 15:49.731
a little life lesson
free of charge.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.951
It's not bragging if it's true.

15:58.696 --> 16:01.395
Oh.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.092
So, what's in the box?

16:03.136 --> 16:05.007
Jewelry.
Hmm.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.574
Like Heart of the Ocean-type
jewelry?

16:06.617 --> 16:07.575
I don't know
what that is.

16:07.618 --> 16:08.750
Titanic?

16:08.793 --> 16:10.839
The big blue stone
worth millions?

16:10.882 --> 16:12.972
The necklace that
the whole movie was about?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.452
Okay. All right, Sam, that is
not what the movie's about.

16:15.496 --> 16:16.671
No?
No!

16:16.714 --> 16:18.368
Titanicis a love story

16:18.412 --> 16:20.892
about the American class system
told through the lens

16:20.936 --> 16:23.460
of the passengers
on an ill-fated ocean liner.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.897
And?

16:25.941 --> 16:29.989
And now
that I'm saying it out loud,

16:30.032 --> 16:31.947
yeah, I guess the necklace did
tie the whole thing together.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.775
Okay, well, I've never seen it,
and, no,

16:33.818 --> 16:34.950
it's nothing like that.
Veronica said

16:34.994 --> 16:36.299
that it was all
family heirlooms

16:36.343 --> 16:37.866
and probably
worthless.Wow.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.476
Well, if that's the case,

16:39.520 --> 16:41.826
the robbers are gonna be pretty
upset when they learn that.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.046
Yeah, no kidding.Something's not adding up.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.352
Huh.
Agreed.

16:45.395 --> 16:46.918
Nell, why don't you
and Eric look

16:46.962 --> 16:48.268
into Veronica Stephens'
consulting company?

16:48.311 --> 16:49.486
Want to see if
everything they're doing

16:49.530 --> 16:51.271
is actually
above board.
You got it.

16:51.314 --> 16:52.315
This may help.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.317
What's this about?Hate mail.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.667
God.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.844
I mean, when I look at this
stuff, all I can think of is:

16:59.888 --> 17:02.325
how do people have the time?

17:02.369 --> 17:04.545
What a waste.

17:05.589 --> 17:08.244
Okay, here's the record of

17:08.288 --> 17:10.116
everyone who's accessed
their security deposit box.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.726
And if you need

17:11.769 --> 17:14.511
to go back further than this,
I have all the prior books

17:14.555 --> 17:15.730
in storage.Thank you.
It's very helpful.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.037
All right, there--

17:18.080 --> 17:19.690
Veronica Stephens,
two weeks ago.

17:19.734 --> 17:20.996
Okay, so it looks like

17:21.040 --> 17:22.519
Veronica Stephens came in
a couple weeks ago

17:22.563 --> 17:24.173
to access her
security deposit box.

17:24.217 --> 17:25.435
Sounds about right.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.002
Do you know
who helped her that day?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.351
We're just trying to figure out
if something happened then

17:28.395 --> 17:29.439
that could explain
what happened this morning.

17:29.483 --> 17:30.832
Hold on, Kens.
She came in

17:30.875 --> 17:32.616
a week prior to that.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.575
And there--
what is that? Two weeks

17:34.618 --> 17:35.663
before that.Interesting.

17:35.706 --> 17:36.794
Well, that doesn't
surprise me.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.579
Veronica's in here all the time.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.320
To do what,
deposit checks or...?

17:40.363 --> 17:42.539
No, to access her deposit box.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.673
You know what?
Actually, we would love

17:45.716 --> 17:47.327
to see those previous log books
if possible.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.458
Could you grab those?Be right back.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.112
Thank you.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.462
So, Veronica Stephens is
accessing her safety deposit box

17:52.506 --> 17:53.681
multiple times a month.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.117
Which is fine.Totally fine.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.858
Unless, of course,
you're sticking to your story

17:56.901 --> 17:58.164
that the only thing in there

17:58.207 --> 17:59.904
is fake antique jewelry
that just sits there.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.211
Ruh-roh.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.308
Hmm. What are you
boys doing in here?

18:12.352 --> 18:13.614
Just working.

18:13.657 --> 18:16.791
He's hiding from Rogers.

18:16.834 --> 18:17.661
I don't know
if "hiding" is the word.

18:17.705 --> 18:18.880
I'd say more like "avoiding."

18:18.923 --> 18:19.924
NELL:
It's cool. I get it.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.274
Rogers took a liking
to my chair,

18:21.317 --> 18:23.450
so I bailed and set myself up
in the gadget room.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.713
What do you mean you bailed?You left Beale

18:25.756 --> 18:27.106
alone in Ops with him?

18:27.149 --> 18:28.759
Um... yes?

18:28.803 --> 18:30.239
Damn.Nell don't play.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.675
Where's your sense of loyalty?

18:33.590 --> 18:34.635
In other news,

18:34.678 --> 18:36.767
I found some
interesting information

18:36.811 --> 18:39.030
on Veronica Stephens'
consulting firm.Shoot.

18:39.074 --> 18:41.163
It looks like CCG has
a pretty creative approach

18:41.207 --> 18:44.775
to accounting that I'm pretty
sure won't hold up to an audit.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.342
How creative?

18:46.386 --> 18:48.127
Oh, you know, some black holes
in the balance sheet here,

18:48.170 --> 18:49.911
some tax evasion there.

18:49.954 --> 18:52.479
Hmm. It's interesting.The financial crimes part

18:52.522 --> 18:55.656
or the misleading
federal agents part?No, the fact that

18:55.699 --> 18:58.441
the heist this morning may end
up being a blessing in disguise.

18:58.485 --> 18:59.834
You're right.

18:59.877 --> 19:01.792
I mean,
we never would have looked

19:01.836 --> 19:03.185
into Veronica Stephens' company

19:03.229 --> 19:04.926
if someone hadn't stolen
her security deposit box.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.536
Exactly.

19:06.580 --> 19:09.017
What are you thinking?

19:09.060 --> 19:11.498
I think there are coincidences

19:11.541 --> 19:13.978
and then there are...
coincidences.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.894
I'm just saying.

19:16.938 --> 19:20.376
So you're saying, whoever stole
the security deposit box knew

19:20.420 --> 19:22.073
federal agents were
gonna get involved

19:22.117 --> 19:23.336
and wanted us to
look into her books?

19:23.379 --> 19:25.381
But that's not
what I'm worried about.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.558
I'm worried
that we might be playing

19:28.602 --> 19:30.647
right into someone's hands.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.780
Hmm.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.014
Let's start
at the beginning.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.755
It's a decent place to start.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.757
We need to figure out who stole
Veronica Stephens' security box

19:53.801 --> 19:54.541
from the bank this morning.

19:54.584 --> 19:55.716
And what was in that box.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.108
Why someone wanted us to look

19:57.152 --> 19:58.893
into her consulting firm
in the first place.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.111
And how deep and how far

20:00.155 --> 20:01.461
Veronica's financial crimes
really go.

20:02.549 --> 20:03.506
That's a lot.

20:03.550 --> 20:04.986
You read my mind.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.596
Yes, it is.
But we have climbed

20:06.640 --> 20:08.207
bigger mountains in the past.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.426
Have we, though?
'Cause I'm not really
sure that we have.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.211
This is feeling
pretty steep to me.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.777
You know what I mean?
Like, Meru steep.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.388
Have you guys seen Meru?
Oh, it's incredible.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.651
Everything about it's amazing.
And then you realize

20:17.694 --> 20:19.522
that she used to be
married to the other guy.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.045
My mind was like boom! Meru?

20:21.089 --> 20:22.612
The mountain-climbing
documentary?KENSI: Oh, boy.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.484
You all are taking
another break from this case,

20:24.527 --> 20:26.442
and that's the topic
of this hour's tête

20:26.486 --> 20:28.618
DEEKS:
No. What you overheard,

20:28.662 --> 20:31.273
Rogers, was an analogy.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.971
In long form,
which I tend to do.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.059
I was using the
visualization...

20:35.103 --> 20:37.018
Do you guys
ever get any work done?

20:38.062 --> 20:39.586
All the time.

20:39.629 --> 20:40.978
KENSI:
We're actually

20:41.022 --> 20:42.110
pretty good at it.

20:42.153 --> 20:43.285
We have a
unique process.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.504
And what, if I may ask,

20:44.547 --> 20:47.158
is the next step
in your unique process?

20:47.202 --> 20:49.465
Going back to see
Veronica Stephens. Sam?

20:49.509 --> 20:51.554
Right behind you.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.383
Gentlemen,

20:54.427 --> 20:55.341
I think I'll tag along.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.690
Ah.
No.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.344
You have a problem with that?

20:58.387 --> 20:59.562
Hell yeah.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.217
Besides,

21:02.261 --> 21:03.827
I'm driving the
Hellcat today.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.612
There's no back seat, so
even if we wanted to...

21:05.655 --> 21:06.656
KENSI:
Safety first.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.844
Can I get either
of you a tea?

21:20.888 --> 21:22.759
We have mint, Earl Grey,
English breakfast,

21:22.803 --> 21:25.066
red rooibos, and
citrus chamomile.

21:25.109 --> 21:27.634
Iced or hot.We're fine.

21:27.677 --> 21:30.027
And matcha. I always
forget the matcha.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.290
No, thanks.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.813
Okay.

21:36.773 --> 21:38.253
Agents Callen and Hanna.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.124
Didn't expect

21:40.168 --> 21:42.170
to see you again so soon.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.913
You don't already
have news, do you?

21:45.956 --> 21:47.131
Why don't we sit down?

21:47.175 --> 21:48.655
No. Let's do this on our feet.

21:48.698 --> 21:49.786
Wh

21:49.830 --> 21:51.310
Your box.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.920
We want to
know exactly

21:52.963 --> 21:54.095
what was inside it.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.531
I already told you.We know what you

21:55.575 --> 21:57.054
told us, but we looked
at the bank's logs,

21:57.098 --> 21:58.273
and they say you access

21:58.317 --> 21:59.927
your security box
a couple of times a month.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.581
And your point is?Well, we're
just wondering

22:01.624 --> 22:03.409
if maybe you were keeping
something in there

22:03.452 --> 22:05.062
that you failed
to mention to us before.

22:05.106 --> 22:08.152
Agent Callen, I don't appreciate
your tone or...

22:08.196 --> 22:09.763
whatever it is
you're insinuating.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.721
I'm simply asking questions.Which, as far as
I'm concerned,

22:11.765 --> 22:12.635
I've already answered.

22:14.768 --> 22:17.597
Now, thank you for your time
and your service, but...

22:17.640 --> 22:19.555
I really ought
to be getting back to work.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.731
Of course.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.994
If you'll
excuse me.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.001
Think she'll lawyer up?

22:31.045 --> 22:33.264
We'll find out
soon enough.
Hmm.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.877
Hey. You wanted to see us?

22:36.920 --> 22:38.966
Yeah. Hey, check this out.
So I went through

22:39.009 --> 22:41.185
the bank's security footage,
and I noticed this guy.

22:41.229 --> 22:43.927
He showed up every Monday
morning for the last six Mondays

22:43.971 --> 22:45.320
like clockwork.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.366
He never spoke to anyone,
never deposited anything.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.803
So is he casing the place?Yeah, he was probably

22:49.846 --> 22:51.805
counting foot traffic,
so when he'd hit the bank,

22:51.848 --> 22:53.415
it'd be as empty as possible.Well, no wonder

22:53.459 --> 22:55.156
they got in and out
in under three minutes

22:55.199 --> 22:56.766
and didn't bother
carrying real weapons.

22:56.810 --> 22:57.985
I mean, they thought
of everything.

22:58.028 --> 22:59.465
What we know
about the guy in the video?

22:59.508 --> 23:01.249
Mm, unfortunately, not much.

23:01.292 --> 23:02.729
It's a grainy image.

23:02.772 --> 23:04.383
Looks like a dead end.

23:04.426 --> 23:05.645
That's a bummer.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.211
:
Just kidding.
I already ran

23:07.255 --> 23:08.604
his picture through facial rec.

23:08.648 --> 23:11.390
He is enjoying a burrito
in Venice as we speak.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.350
I like it.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.351
Like that?Funny.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.265
Little switcheroo.

23:17.308 --> 23:18.832
It's clever.
Cool.So excited

23:18.875 --> 23:19.920
about delivering that to you.

23:19.963 --> 23:20.921
Deuces.

23:20.964 --> 23:21.791
Oh, my God.

23:28.668 --> 23:31.497
KENSI:
Oh. Eleven o'clock. See him?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.455
DEEKS:
Yep, I see him. What's our play?

23:33.499 --> 23:35.414
I could ask him where the
nearest gas station is.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.719
While you're on foot?
That's creepy.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.591
Also, what Google Maps is for.Okay. Well,

23:38.634 --> 23:41.158
then why don't you just go
ask him how his burrito is?

23:41.202 --> 23:42.812
While he's actually eating it?
That's intrusive.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.858
And what Yelp is for.Oh, my gosh.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.513
Okay, maybe I just go and
ask him what his number is.

23:47.556 --> 23:48.688
While he's just sitting there?

23:48.731 --> 23:50.385
:
That's super sketchy.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.953
And also literally
what Tinder is for.Okay, I think you and I

23:52.996 --> 23:54.824
both know that that is
not what Tinder is for.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.304
I don't know
what to tell you.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.219
I think the Interweb
has made our jobs impossible.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.613
KENSI:
It doesn't matter.
He's on the move.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.832
DEEKS:
Hey, Greg?

24:02.876 --> 24:04.051
Hey! No.
Federal agents!

24:04.094 --> 24:04.878
Stop!

24:04.921 --> 24:06.270
Oh! Sorry, I need this.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.142
I'll bring it right back!
I'm a federal agent!

24:08.185 --> 24:09.622
Federal agents!

24:09.665 --> 24:11.450
Oh, God. Sorry.
I got to go save the world.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.800
Sorry.

24:13.843 --> 24:15.845
Oh, hey-hey, ba-ta-ha,
ba-ta-hey, ba-ta-ha.

24:17.717 --> 24:19.675
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:19.719 --> 24:20.850
Oh! Okay.

24:24.201 --> 24:25.855
Sorry. Oh, oh, okay, sorry.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.770
Sorry, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. Hi, kids.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.511
Come on. Don't do drugs.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.730
Oh, where are
my wrist guards

24:30.773 --> 24:32.906
when I need 'em?

24:36.823 --> 24:37.867
Look out! What?!

24:37.911 --> 24:39.390
Oh! I know it looks like he's

24:39.434 --> 24:41.001
my friend--
he's not my friend! I'm sorry!

24:41.044 --> 24:41.871
You son of a bitch.

24:45.396 --> 24:46.615
All right.

24:46.659 --> 24:47.964
Nice and easy.

24:48.965 --> 24:50.532
Wow!

24:50.576 --> 24:52.839
Skateboard. Good call.
Where'd you get that?

24:52.882 --> 24:53.753
Oh, you know,

24:53.796 --> 24:55.581
just asked a guy for his number.

24:55.624 --> 24:58.061
Touché.

24:58.105 --> 24:59.846
I went down some steps.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.284
It was pretty awesome.

25:17.994 --> 25:20.083
I'm not a horrible person, am I?

25:20.127 --> 25:21.781
CALLEN:
Well, it depends.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.434
Is Eric still fending
for himself?

25:23.478 --> 25:25.088
Eh, maybe.SAM: You know what?

25:25.132 --> 25:27.830
I respect that.Yeah, exactly.
I am doing this for Eric.

25:27.874 --> 25:29.832
This is a completely
selfless act on my behalf.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.791
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, am I right?

25:31.834 --> 25:32.792
It's too far, waytoo far.

25:32.835 --> 25:34.097
Yeah, I kind of felt bad.

25:34.141 --> 25:35.446
I mean, I could
hear myself saying it,

25:35.490 --> 25:36.839
and I was like, "Ooh, so 2011,"

25:36.883 --> 25:38.493
but then I just couldn't stop.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.451
We think Veronica Stephens
may be hiding something.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.541
That could be why CCG is
using creative accounting.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.151
Why don't you go through
her company's projects

25:44.194 --> 25:45.935
and try to figure out
what it is?

25:45.979 --> 25:47.720
Wait, isn't that exactly what
the robbers would want us to do?

25:47.763 --> 25:48.721
SAM:
Maybe.

25:48.764 --> 25:49.678
We'll deal with that later.

25:49.722 --> 25:51.201
You got it.

25:51.245 --> 25:53.595
One order of dark corporate
skeletons coming right up.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.559
Okay. Thanks, Eric.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.734
All right, Greg.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.605
Hold on.

26:03.649 --> 26:04.867
How'd you know my name?

26:04.911 --> 26:06.347
What?

26:06.390 --> 26:08.349
: That's not
even the impressive part.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.090
You see, it's
on this driver's license.

26:10.133 --> 26:12.571
You know, the one
you just gave me.

26:12.614 --> 26:15.312
But how'd you know it was mine?

26:16.357 --> 26:17.619
Your picture's on it.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.752
DEEKS:
Oh, my God, Kensi,

26:19.795 --> 26:22.102
how hard did you
hit him in the head?Oh, she didn't hit

26:22.145 --> 26:24.626
my head at all.You know what, let me see
if I get your story straight.

26:24.670 --> 26:27.498
So, you dropped out
of high school in Florida

26:27.542 --> 26:29.675
because you took one drama class
and you figured, "Well,

26:29.718 --> 26:31.459
"Clooney did it,
so I'm gonna ride my looks

26:31.502 --> 26:32.634
all the way to Hollywood."

26:32.678 --> 26:34.201
That seems like an
excellent life plan.

26:34.244 --> 26:35.681
What could possibly go wrong?So you leave behind

26:35.724 --> 26:38.727
everybody you know and love
to come out here to act,

26:38.771 --> 26:40.816
but the only jobs
you've actually gotten

26:40.860 --> 26:42.209
are just lame
bartending jobs.

26:42.252 --> 26:43.602
Moonshine Cantina?

26:43.645 --> 26:45.560
Well, they were hiring.But this is
not the reason

26:45.604 --> 26:46.866
you're handcuffed
to the back of my car.

26:46.909 --> 26:48.345
It's not?

26:48.389 --> 26:50.434
Where were you
this morning, Gregory?I don't know.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.828
Sleeping?
How early we talking?

26:52.872 --> 26:54.961
Were you at the Westwood branch
of the Trust National?

26:55.004 --> 26:56.223
No.

26:56.266 --> 26:58.094
We know you're casing the place

26:58.138 --> 27:00.793
every single Monday 'cause
your pretty little face is

27:00.836 --> 27:03.099
all over the
security footage.Casing the place?

27:03.143 --> 27:06.363
No. I may have been there
the past few Mondays,

27:06.407 --> 27:07.930
but not today.

27:07.974 --> 27:09.845
So, what were you doing there?

27:09.889 --> 27:11.238
Counting.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.675
That's it. They wanted me
to hang out at the bank

27:13.719 --> 27:15.416
and tell them
how many people showed up.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.592
And what time the tellers
got their coffee.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.811
Who did?

27:18.854 --> 27:21.074
I don't know.
It was all done over text.

27:21.117 --> 27:22.902
I'll tell you one thing, though,
easiest Mission Monkey gig

27:22.945 --> 27:24.468
I ever got.

27:24.512 --> 27:26.035
Mission Monkey?

27:29.169 --> 27:32.651
Okay. Well, this
has obviously been

27:32.694 --> 27:34.696
a giant misunderstanding,

27:34.740 --> 27:37.699
and for that I
profusely apologize.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.135
Feel better?

27:39.179 --> 27:40.267
Hey, look, Gregory.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.529
Right there. A squirrel!
Look at that.

27:42.182 --> 27:43.618
Okay.
Hi.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.575
I can go?

27:44.619 --> 27:45.664
Either that,
or you can stay here

27:45.707 --> 27:46.360
and we can keep
asking you questions.

27:47.709 --> 27:48.928
Yeah.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.712
Oh, my God.

27:52.192 --> 27:54.324
Okay, so...

27:54.368 --> 27:57.763
somebody hired Greg to go
to the bank and count people

27:57.806 --> 28:00.679
and then most likely text them
to an untraceable burn phone.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.419
Now, he's either
telling the truth

28:02.463 --> 28:04.813
and didn't know anything
about the robbery from
the beginning...

28:04.857 --> 28:06.510
Or we can track him,

28:06.554 --> 28:09.818
and he's gonna lead us
straight to the snake's head.

28:12.516 --> 28:16.433
What'd you find?Well, CCG does a lot
of off-book business

28:16.477 --> 28:18.609
with countries that
are, let's just say,

28:18.653 --> 28:20.655
patriumnon grata in the U.S.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.484
Okay, so what are we talking?
North Korea

28:23.527 --> 28:24.485
Iran.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.182
Veronica Stephens
has been doing

28:26.226 --> 28:28.010
consulting for them for years.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.882
Well, I bet the Navy
doesn't know about that.

28:29.925 --> 28:32.232
No, they wouldn't keep hiring
her as a defense consultant.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.495
And there's more.
We found a pattern.

28:34.538 --> 28:37.280
Every time CCG does
defense work for the Navy,

28:37.324 --> 28:40.414
Veronica deposits $75K
into her personal bank account.

28:40.457 --> 28:43.460
Hmm. Maybe she's selling
government secrets.And been doing it

28:43.504 --> 28:46.289
under our noses
the entire time.

28:48.378 --> 28:53.122
You guys managed to exercise,
discuss documentary films,

28:53.166 --> 28:56.038
and identify an alleged traitor
to the United States.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.997
And it's not even lunch.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.041
Bravo.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.739
Bravo.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.536
Look at her.
She doesn't even
seem nervous.

29:15.579 --> 29:17.103
Veronica Stephens
is a traitor.

29:17.146 --> 29:19.801
I'm sure she made peace with
her politics a long time ago.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.673
Yeah, you're
probably right.

29:22.717 --> 29:25.720
I still don't like that we
don't know who's behind this.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.766
That makes two of us.

29:29.985 --> 29:32.161
I get wanting to
take her down.

29:32.205 --> 29:35.208
But whoever set this
thing in motion,

29:35.251 --> 29:37.601
whoever was behind that
robbery this morning,

29:37.645 --> 29:39.821
I don't believe they
think this thing ends

29:39.865 --> 29:42.824
with her being led
away in handcuffs.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.827
There's got to be
more to this.

29:45.871 --> 29:48.787
Let's go see what she
thinks about your theory.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.789
SAM:
Let's do it.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.837
CALLEN:
All right.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.839
Anything you want to get off
your chest before we begin?

29:57.883 --> 29:59.667
SAM: Mm.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.669
You sure you don't want
to get out in front of this?

30:01.712 --> 30:03.236
Well, actually, it may
be too late for that.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.672
Yeah, you're right.

30:04.715 --> 30:06.500
How long has it been?
How many years?

30:06.543 --> 30:08.067
How many years has it been
since what?Since you've been selling

30:08.110 --> 30:09.808
government secrets to Iran.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.031
You know, I tried to warn you.

30:16.075 --> 30:17.119
You tried to warn us?

30:17.163 --> 30:17.946
Several times.

30:17.990 --> 30:18.817
I'm sorry...I told you

30:18.860 --> 30:20.340
that LAPD could handle this

30:20.383 --> 30:22.429
and that there was no reason
for NCIS to get involved.

30:22.472 --> 30:23.560
Why is that?

30:23.604 --> 30:24.735
Because I didn't want it
to come to this.

30:24.779 --> 30:25.824
SAM: You didn't want
it to come to this?

30:25.867 --> 30:26.781
No kidding.

30:26.825 --> 30:27.869
You didn't want to get caught.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.044
Easy there, tiger.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.132
You seem

30:30.176 --> 30:31.394
surprisingly unfazed
by all this.

30:31.438 --> 30:32.439
Well, thank you.

30:32.482 --> 30:33.614
I didn't mean that
as a compliment.

30:33.657 --> 30:34.658
Well, I'm taking it
as one,

30:34.702 --> 30:35.659

I haven't been selling
government secrets to Iran.

30:46.932 --> 30:49.412
I have been risking my life

30:59.292 --> 31:00.946
Sweet, sweet Greg is very angry.

about the bank robbery

31:02.686 --> 31:03.644

No.

Well, of course
they did.

never heard of you either.

that doesn't surprise me.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.590

You spoke
with Vostanik Sabatino,

31:39.419 --> 31:41.160
am I right?

31:41.203 --> 31:43.336
Gentlemen,
Sabatino doesn't know me

31:43.379 --> 31:44.990
from Monica Lewinsky.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.643
I spent the last
decade working

31:46.687 --> 31:48.558

that convenient?

31:48.602 --> 31:50.865
Veronica, who do you think
stole your safety deposit box

31:50.909 --> 31:52.171
this morning?I don't know.

31:52.214 --> 31:54.303
But whoever it was knew
I worked for the CIA.

31:54.347 --> 31:56.392
Why do you say that?

31:56.436 --> 31:57.524
Because that safe deposit box

31:57.567 --> 31:59.439
was the only link I had
to the Agency.

31:59.482 --> 32:01.354
It was where I collected
my assignments

32:01.397 --> 32:02.442
and delivered my intel.

32:02.485 --> 32:03.834
So what was really in the box?

32:03.878 --> 32:05.314
I don't know.

32:05.358 --> 32:07.969
I was supposed to go to the bank

32:08.013 --> 32:09.405
to collect my next assignment.

32:09.449 --> 32:10.798

On the one hand, you could
be telling the truth.

Sabatino's pay grade at the CIA.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.218
DEEKS:
Whoa.

37:04.831 --> 37:06.006
Kens.

37:07.312 --> 37:08.574
SAM:
We got eyes on the van.

37:14.449 --> 37:15.320
Ooh.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.296
No.

37:36.384 --> 37:38.125
Eric, we need
an ambulance.

37:40.475 --> 37:41.650
Kens, you good?Yeah, yeah, we're good!

37:42.825 --> 37:44.392
Oh, what happened?

37:47.047 --> 37:48.396
Well, of course, you're fine.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.006
Who's there

37:50.050 --> 37:51.660
Wait a minute.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.314
Guys?

37:53.358 --> 37:54.663
SAM:
What?

37:54.707 --> 37:57.449
You're never gonna believe this.

37:58.493 --> 38:00.321
Wow.

38:00.365 --> 38:03.063
The Saudis never
even opened it.

38:04.325 --> 38:06.806
That's because it was never
about what was in the box.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.242
It was about
convincing Americans

38:08.286 --> 38:10.244
that Iran had a spy
in the government.

38:11.550 --> 38:14.944
To make sure we stayed
on Saudi Arabia's side.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.772
Hmm. You think this was

38:16.816 --> 38:18.208
an official Saudi operation?

38:18.252 --> 38:20.559
We're gonna find out who
they were working for.

38:21.516 --> 38:22.909
One of the...

38:22.952 --> 38:25.477
robbers is expected
to make a full recovery.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.392
So,

38:27.435 --> 38:28.610
what's in the box?

38:30.569 --> 38:31.744
Wouldn't you like to know?

38:34.573 --> 38:36.966
Look, I'm sorry that, uh,

38:37.010 --> 38:39.404
I wasn't more up front
with you before.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.231
We understand.

38:41.275 --> 38:43.408
You had a cover to protect.

38:43.451 --> 38:46.715
Which I am grateful
that you didn't tear apart.

38:46.759 --> 38:47.586
Well, you're
gonna need it.

38:47.629 --> 38:48.587
It's very clear

38:48.630 --> 38:49.936
there's a leak in your agency.

38:49.979 --> 38:52.199
And my guess would be
that it's a lot bigger

38:52.242 --> 38:53.374
than what happened today.

38:53.418 --> 38:56.856
Which means heads
are gonna roll.

38:56.899 --> 39:00.294
And somehow NCIS has been
dragged in the middle of it.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.513
Yeah, well...

39:01.556 --> 39:03.558
What?

39:04.603 --> 39:06.735
I mean...

39:06.779 --> 39:08.476
I did try to warn you.

39:11.871 --> 39:13.655
You did.

39:20.488 --> 39:22.534
Love it.
Hey!Hey!

39:22.577 --> 39:23.883
Boys!
You made it!

39:23.926 --> 39:25.537
What do you think?
Soak it in.

39:25.580 --> 39:28.191
That shark is awesome.Right?
Right?

39:28.235 --> 39:30.280
Really ties the
room together.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.587
Where is Eric?
You two okay?

39:32.631 --> 39:35.198
Oh. Yeah. We found out, uh,

39:35.242 --> 39:36.678
Rogers is a real
Fortnitefreak,

39:36.722 --> 39:38.419
so they're geeking
out up in Ops.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.552
So you're telling me right now
Rogers is playing video games

39:40.595 --> 39:42.467
on government property,

39:42.510 --> 39:43.468
on the taxpayers' dime?

39:43.511 --> 39:44.643
Mm, technically, no,

39:44.686 --> 39:46.645
because it was after hours

39:46.688 --> 39:48.908
and he grabbed his own console
from his car.

39:48.951 --> 39:50.649
Of course he did.All right, so,

39:50.692 --> 39:52.477
what are we drinking?I think we should start
with some beers.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.869
Yeah, are they cold?

39:53.913 --> 39:55.784
God, I hope so. I bought
that fridge on Craigslist.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.612
"Are they cold

39:57.656 --> 39:59.309
One for you.
For you.

39:59.353 --> 40:00.485
Yeah, they're cold.

40:00.528 --> 40:01.486
Nice.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.096
Cheers, y'all.Cheers!
Cheers.

40:03.139 --> 40:04.227
Congrats, guys.

40:04.271 --> 40:06.229
Well done.Mmm. Mmm!

40:06.273 --> 40:07.666
Mmm!Mmm.

40:07.709 --> 40:09.537
So, Deeks, what are you
calling the place?It's good.

40:09.581 --> 40:11.539
Uh, glad you asked.
So glad you asked.Mm...

40:11.583 --> 40:12.932
Been doing a lot
of workshopping.Mm-hmm.

40:12.975 --> 40:14.934
And so far I've
come up with...

40:14.977 --> 40:17.719
the Blowhole.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.112
Wow.
Yeah.

40:19.155 --> 40:20.635
NELL: Yikes. SAM: Wow.

40:20.679 --> 40:21.767
KENSI: It's a work in progress. DEEKS: Is it?

40:21.810 --> 40:23.072
I thought
that was pretty great.

40:23.116 --> 40:24.334
CALLEN: Blowhole. DEEKS: Blowhole.

40:24.378 --> 40:25.074
Come down to the Blowhole.
