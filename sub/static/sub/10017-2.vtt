00:14.778 --> 00:17.644
Susan? Susan? Susan!

00:17.813 --> 00:18.802
You have to get up.

00:19.014 --> 00:20.208
What time is it?

00:20.416 --> 00:21.974
It's a baby.

00:22.184 --> 00:23.310
A baby.

00:23.518 --> 00:25.782
In respiratory arrest.

00:30.357 --> 00:33.087
One-year-old found unresponsive.
Couldn't get an IV.

00:33.292 --> 00:35.761
- What'd you find?
- No spontaneous resps.

00:35.962 --> 00:38.692
She's cyanotic, faint pulse at 200.
We scooped and ran.

00:38.898 --> 00:39.887
What happened?

00:40.065 --> 00:42.158
- She stopped breathing.
- Has she been sick?

00:42.367 --> 00:43.663
Any medication?

00:44.102 --> 00:46.831
- Any recent trauma?
- No. Nothing!

00:52.809 --> 00:54.777
Let's see if we can find a vein...

00:56.479 --> 00:59.038
Can't get a rhythm.
Sinus track 180.

01:05.186 --> 01:06.585
Come on.

01:11.024 --> 01:12.491
Laryngoscope.

01:21.099 --> 01:22.623
Magill forceps.

01:25.936 --> 01:27.130
Where are you?

01:33.975 --> 01:34.965
An earring.

01:36.412 --> 01:38.743
- Hyperventilate her. Blood sugar?
- Twenty.

01:38.947 --> 01:41.507
I need an 18-gauge spinal.
I'll go in interosseus.

01:41.716 --> 01:42.977
Will she be all right?

01:43.183 --> 01:44.342
I'll need dextrose.

01:44.551 --> 01:46.109
Is she gonna be okay?

01:51.057 --> 01:52.046
Dextrose is in.

01:52.392 --> 01:54.052
- Okay, got it?
- Got it.

02:21.315 --> 02:24.546
Get a blood gas, chest film,
CBC and Chem-7.

02:25.451 --> 02:27.248
She's gonna be fine.

03:26.802 --> 03:29.134
An infant in arrest
and you didn't wake me?

03:29.337 --> 03:31.635
An extra hour's sleep,
you should thank me.

03:31.839 --> 03:34.740
- I know, but...
- We didn't need you for the baby.

03:34.942 --> 03:36.910
Now we need you.

03:37.111 --> 03:39.601
- For what?
- German tourists.

03:39.946 --> 03:42.972
They got food poisoning at
a Hofbrau House on 46th.

03:44.117 --> 03:45.276
<i>Guten Morgen.</i>

03:45.484 --> 03:46.883
<i>Das ist Dr. Carter.</i>

03:47.085 --> 03:50.452
<i>Guten Morgen, Herr Doctor.</i>

03:52.423 --> 03:54.185
They need...

03:54.358 --> 03:56.155
...stool guaiacs.

03:57.227 --> 03:59.024
Rectals?

04:03.198 --> 04:04.597
One, you gotta rule out MI.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.562
Two, that baby Lewis saved.

04:06.768 --> 04:10.101
Three, some old guy who sticks
his hand up his shirt.

04:10.304 --> 04:11.601
Four, chest pains.

04:11.805 --> 04:13.740
Five, a kid with
an allergic reaction.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.840
Where's the guy with the hand?

04:16.375 --> 04:18.036
Morning.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.040
Hey, Timmy. What's up?

04:20.379 --> 04:23.109
We got four coming in
on a chopper, two critical.

04:23.314 --> 04:25.475
- How soon?
- Five to ten.

04:28.086 --> 04:31.350
- Hey, Timmy.
- Dr. Lewis. Hold, please.

04:31.555 --> 04:34.490
I got a chest pain in
Exam Room 4.

04:34.690 --> 04:37.215
Night shift ran an x-ray and EKG.

04:37.427 --> 04:39.725
You know, I really need
a cup of coffee.

04:39.928 --> 04:41.657
Cream, no sugar.

04:42.297 --> 04:43.696
Thank you.

04:50.137 --> 04:52.697
- Wanna help with a chest pain?
- Yes.

04:55.275 --> 04:56.333
Be right back.

04:57.209 --> 04:59.973
Mr. Zambano, I'm Dr. Lewis.
This is John Carter.

05:00.179 --> 05:03.670
In order to evaluate pain,
start with P.Q.R.S.T.

05:04.315 --> 05:05.475
So start.

05:05.683 --> 05:07.742
Great. Provoking/palliating, right?

05:08.186 --> 05:09.813
What brought on your pain?

05:10.020 --> 05:11.486
It started in the shower.

05:11.922 --> 05:13.321
Could you describe it?

05:13.522 --> 05:15.548
It's like somebody's
squeezing my chest.

05:16.091 --> 05:17.456
Right.

05:18.226 --> 05:19.660
Well, good.

05:20.462 --> 05:21.986
Radiation.

05:22.797 --> 05:24.856
Does the pain move anywhere?
Neck, back?

05:25.065 --> 05:26.726
No. What is he, a beginner?

05:27.501 --> 05:29.469
This is a teaching hospital,
Mr. Zambano.

05:32.738 --> 05:35.865
Your EKG's normal,
and your history of angina...

05:36.074 --> 05:38.167
...I don't think we need
to be concerned.

05:38.376 --> 05:42.778
Dr. Carter will keep an eye on you
while we wait for the enzyme results.

05:51.954 --> 05:53.512
It's been eight weeks.

05:53.722 --> 05:56.190
You mean you haven't
even been out there yet?

05:56.391 --> 06:00.952
- Thought about it, just haven't done it.
- You and Hathaway were so close.

06:04.397 --> 06:06.729
It's not gonna get any easier, Doug.

06:08.033 --> 06:09.591
Just go!

06:26.449 --> 06:27.609
Let's go!

06:35.857 --> 06:37.449
Two majors, two minors.

06:37.658 --> 06:38.784
Passenger space intrusion.

06:38.993 --> 06:41.358
Guy ran a red light.
T-boned a car at 50 mph.

06:41.562 --> 06:43.826
Head, neck, chest, pelvic
and hip injury.

06:44.030 --> 06:45.190
She's had 3 liters.

06:45.398 --> 06:47.161
- GCN?
- Point-one-one.

06:47.367 --> 06:50.199
Pressure's 50 over 30,
pulse 120.

06:50.402 --> 06:52.733
All right, okay. Let's go.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.699
Hurry up. Let's go!

07:00.443 --> 07:02.070
What else you got?

07:03.045 --> 07:04.808
Head, neck and abdominal pain.

07:05.015 --> 07:09.041
Pressure's 65.
Pulse 150 and thready.

07:09.251 --> 07:11.242
GCS 4-6-5.

07:11.452 --> 07:15.218
She's got a scalp laceration
and a deformed humerus fracture.

07:15.423 --> 07:18.357
Let's get her downstairs right away.
All right?

07:20.661 --> 07:21.650
Take her into 2.

07:21.861 --> 07:24.295
Doug, take the little girl into 1.

07:27.132 --> 07:28.964
Mommy!

07:30.936 --> 07:32.995
All right,
do this on my count.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.603
And one, two, three, go!

07:37.174 --> 07:40.337
Type and cross-match 6 units
packed-cell CBC. Chem-7.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.033
Let's get the O-neg moving, now.

07:47.282 --> 07:48.544
I need a chest tube tray.

07:48.749 --> 07:51.843
Let's move. This isn't
a museum, we got work to do.

07:52.053 --> 07:54.385
- Who else is on the floor?
- Everybody's working.

07:54.588 --> 07:57.421
Call the O.R. And let's
see who they can spare.

07:58.024 --> 07:59.821
Mommy!

08:03.395 --> 08:06.228
- Type and cross-match four units.
- Positive.

08:06.431 --> 08:08.423
She's still 50 palp. Pulse is 180.

08:08.633 --> 08:11.066
Sweetheart, tell me where
else it hurts, okay?

08:11.269 --> 08:13.133
Concentrate, all right?

08:13.337 --> 08:15.032
- You hear me?
- Mommy!

08:15.237 --> 08:18.104
Okay, you hear me?
Tell me where it hurts.

08:18.307 --> 08:20.298
Does it hurt here? How about here?

08:21.310 --> 08:24.006
- Spleen.
- We gotta get her to the O.R., now!

08:24.679 --> 08:26.977
Stay really still, okay?

08:27.214 --> 08:29.115
Mommy!

08:40.726 --> 08:42.421
This the guy who hit them?

08:42.628 --> 08:44.322
- Is he gonna be all right?
- Yep.

08:44.529 --> 08:45.757
Too bad.

08:45.963 --> 08:47.225
We'll need blood alcohol.

08:47.431 --> 08:50.298
- Bet it's over.20
- .35, easy.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.991
Let's get a tox screen
and a CT of his head.

08:53.203 --> 08:55.467
We have to rule out head trauma.

08:57.641 --> 09:00.336
- Has he done this before?
- Five times.

09:05.346 --> 09:09.611
Mr. Ring, we called Orthopedics.
They'll be down to look at your leg.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.181
My wife and daughter okay?

09:11.385 --> 09:13.477
We're working on them right now.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.880
I didn't even see him.

09:15.087 --> 09:18.454
The light changed, Janet screamed,
and there he was.

09:19.290 --> 09:21.451
We're working on your family.

09:29.065 --> 09:31.364
- How many more do we have?
- Three.

09:31.834 --> 09:35.894
Three. I have to check on
a patient. I'll be right back.

09:49.482 --> 09:50.642
Still feeling okay?

09:50.850 --> 09:53.114
How much longer am I gonna
have to wait?

09:53.318 --> 09:56.310
Just a couple more minutes.
We are very busy today.

09:56.521 --> 09:58.785
But you're feeling all right
otherwise?

09:59.323 --> 10:00.415
Mr. Zambano?

10:02.293 --> 10:03.281
Mr. Zambano?

10:17.972 --> 10:19.768
Hey! I need some help in here!

10:45.061 --> 10:46.050
Clear!

10:47.830 --> 10:50.094
- What the hell you doing?
- Sorry.

10:50.299 --> 10:53.165
- You need help?
- I'm here.

10:54.635 --> 10:59.663
- Vital signs stable?
- Yes. Sir, you're gonna be just fine.

11:03.476 --> 11:05.843
Pressure's 80 over 50. Pulse 120.

11:06.045 --> 11:08.707
They ready for her upstairs?
All right, let's go.

11:08.914 --> 11:10.312
Get Ortho to the O.R.

11:10.516 --> 11:14.348
We're taking you to another part of
the hospital to make you better.

11:14.719 --> 11:17.279
- Where's Mommy?
- We're taking care of her too.

11:17.488 --> 11:20.012
And your daddy will be there
when you wake up.

11:21.624 --> 11:23.251
Here you go, Doug.

11:26.962 --> 11:29.988
- She gonna make it?
- Ruptured spleen. How's the father?

11:30.198 --> 11:31.563
Orthopods are doing his leg.

11:31.767 --> 11:34.998
The driver's sleeping like a baby.
Not a scratch on him.

11:38.404 --> 11:39.837
How's the mother?

11:40.039 --> 11:41.336
Maybe.

11:54.018 --> 11:56.577
It's 8 weeks since she
attempted suicide.

11:56.788 --> 11:57.811
You two were close.

11:58.555 --> 12:01.456
You and Hathaway shared
a lot of things.

12:01.657 --> 12:03.887
I stopped by. A couple of times.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.927
Never got out of the car.

12:08.363 --> 12:11.196
Take her some flowers.
You don't have to stay long.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.369
You want me to go with you?

12:18.572 --> 12:19.833
I'm off Sundays.

12:20.039 --> 12:21.631
I don't know. I don't know.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.772
I'll drive.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.342
It's me.

12:32.616 --> 12:34.641
It's not your fault, Doug.

12:34.851 --> 12:36.876
You gotta forgive yourself
sooner or later.

12:53.633 --> 12:56.966
Pop! Pop! Just like that,
he shoot me. For cigarettes!

12:57.169 --> 12:58.796
Give him a gram of ancef IV.

12:59.004 --> 13:02.633
No older than my grandson.
Twelve, maybe. With a little gun.

13:02.841 --> 13:04.468
CBC chest and shoulder films.

13:04.676 --> 13:06.166
Little man. Little gun.

13:06.377 --> 13:09.368
Fifteen years I am selling liquor
out of the same store.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.207
Robbed seven times,
never hurt. Nothing!

13:12.983 --> 13:16.042
Now I get shot by sixth grader
with baby gun.

13:16.251 --> 13:17.843
Patient in 2
with abdominal pain...

13:18.054 --> 13:20.851
...and one in Trauma with
a stab wound.

13:21.056 --> 13:22.318
Mr. Gregor, you're lucky.

13:22.791 --> 13:24.621
The bullet went straight through.

13:24.825 --> 13:26.588
I'm gonna send you up to O.R.

13:26.794 --> 13:28.921
They'll explore the wound for
serious damage...

13:29.129 --> 13:31.323
...remove any dead tissue
and debris.

13:31.531 --> 13:33.556
Work up the patient in 2,
focus H and P.

13:33.766 --> 13:35.791
I'll be there in ten minutes.

13:36.001 --> 13:37.628
- Ten minutes?
- Or less.

13:38.637 --> 13:41.470
You like cognac?
I can get you a good cognac.

13:41.673 --> 13:43.333
Smooth as silk.

13:45.276 --> 13:47.335
- That won't be necessary.
- Cigars, then?

13:47.544 --> 13:48.533
Cuban, maybe?

13:48.845 --> 13:51.473
No, no, no. That's fine.
Thank you, though.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.908
I don't smoke.

13:53.115 --> 13:54.640
Dr. Carter.

13:54.850 --> 13:56.681
You have nine minutes.

13:56.918 --> 13:57.942
Good doctor, eh?

13:59.255 --> 14:00.778
He's the best.

14:00.989 --> 14:03.219
He has a low-grade fever,
slight cough...

14:03.424 --> 14:06.392
...postural hypotension,
and he's dehydrated.

14:07.227 --> 14:09.353
- I have to go home.
- I know.

14:09.563 --> 14:12.894
You told us your first name.
Do you remember your last name?

14:15.600 --> 14:18.067
- I have to go home.
- Victor, lie still.

14:18.270 --> 14:19.464
Why don't you lie back?

14:19.670 --> 14:21.536
We might need some restraints.

14:21.739 --> 14:23.639
I have to feed my dog.

14:23.841 --> 14:28.174
Give him D5, NS. 300cc's.
Do a head CT, non-contrast.

14:28.378 --> 14:31.472
Get Psych Services down here for a
consult. Do a GGF-1.

14:31.647 --> 14:32.636
A GGF-1?

14:32.848 --> 14:36.248
Grandpa's Got a Fever. CBC,
Chem-7, chest x-ray, UA...

14:36.451 --> 14:37.781
...and blood cultures.

14:43.023 --> 14:44.115
Give it to me quick.

14:44.324 --> 14:46.758
65-year-old male with
vascular disease...

14:46.960 --> 14:48.722
...manifested by claudication
of the left calf.

14:48.928 --> 14:52.625
He's 10 days post-op from Mercy General
after an aorto-bifemoral bypass.

14:52.830 --> 14:55.162
Normal post-op course until
six hours ago...

14:55.367 --> 14:58.301
...when he experienced lower
left quadrant pain...

14:58.503 --> 15:01.198
...without palliative
or provoking factors.

15:02.139 --> 15:04.164
Other than a large Mexican dinner.

15:04.373 --> 15:07.740
- Meds?
- 30cc's Milk of Magnesia, constipation.

15:08.177 --> 15:10.076
Mother's maiden name?

15:13.682 --> 15:15.343
He's joking.

15:19.653 --> 15:22.678
Good morning, Mr. Thunhurst.
I'm Dr. Benton.

15:24.023 --> 15:27.925
- You have abdominal pain?
- I called my doctor. He isn't here yet.

15:28.126 --> 15:29.616
Joe Arndt. You know Joe?

15:29.828 --> 15:31.260
No, I don't.

15:32.531 --> 15:33.622
Is it sensitive here?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.934
No rebound or guarding.

15:38.134 --> 15:40.034
Leg is warm.

15:40.570 --> 15:41.696
Cap refill is normal.

15:41.905 --> 15:43.804
My leg is fine, my stomach hurts.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.805
Dr. Carter, what would you do?

15:48.143 --> 15:51.305
With his history of constipation
and the type of pain...

15:51.512 --> 15:53.173
...l'd order a CBC...

15:53.381 --> 15:55.814
...Chem-7, UA amylase
and a KUB.

15:56.883 --> 16:00.649
- Lf they're normal?
- I'd discharge him. Let him see his physician.

16:01.654 --> 16:02.643
Congratulations.

16:03.322 --> 16:06.314
You just cost this hospital
a $2-million settlement.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.755
You could have a thrombosis
with extension...

16:11.962 --> 16:13.726
...into the mesenteric arteries.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.091
What's a thrombosis?

16:15.299 --> 16:18.995
It's a blood clot.
They replaced an artery in your leg.

16:19.202 --> 16:23.160
Sometimes a clot forms in the artery.
I'd like to rule it out.

16:23.905 --> 16:25.065
Get him an arteriogram.

16:25.273 --> 16:26.535
Can't we wait for my doctor?

16:26.742 --> 16:28.209
I don't think that'd be wise.

16:28.409 --> 16:31.105
Notify Radiology and get them
on it right away.

16:35.648 --> 16:37.343
Thrombosis.

16:41.587 --> 16:45.488
The mother's still in surgery.
The blood alcohol came back at.435

16:45.690 --> 16:47.214
What about the drug screen?

16:47.425 --> 16:48.824
It was negative.

16:49.927 --> 16:51.622
There's no justice, is there?

16:51.828 --> 16:53.420
Not much.

17:03.471 --> 17:06.268
He's dehydrated and has a slight
respiratory infection.

17:06.473 --> 17:09.032
He's still confused and agitated.

17:11.411 --> 17:13.777
Sir, sir.
I have two dogs and...

17:13.981 --> 17:16.471
Two? That's great, sir.

17:17.083 --> 17:21.280
- Did you run a CAT scan?
- Diffuse atrophy. Nothing new or focal.

17:22.154 --> 17:23.644
I'm out of here.

17:25.323 --> 17:28.348
- That's it?
- What were you expecting?

17:28.558 --> 17:30.924
I thought he'd be admitted to
Psych Services.

17:31.127 --> 17:32.424
But he's got an infection.

17:32.629 --> 17:35.324
He's senile and he needs
psych support.

17:35.531 --> 17:38.125
So now you're a psychiatrist?

17:38.333 --> 17:41.130
I can recognize senile dementia
when I see it.

17:41.403 --> 17:43.427
He's not medically
cleared to my service.

17:43.638 --> 17:46.231
He has a respiratory
infection and he's dehydrated.

17:46.441 --> 17:49.375
What he needs is antibiotics
and IV hydration.

17:49.576 --> 17:53.067
I'll buff him up, start
the antibiotics and pull the IV.

17:53.279 --> 17:56.908
Give him 2.5 Haldol and have Social
Services do a follow-up.

17:57.115 --> 17:58.912
I don't have a bed for him.

17:59.118 --> 18:00.914
He needs our help.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.083
You want me turning away
homicidal psychotics...

18:04.289 --> 18:06.756
...because your patient's got
one of my beds?

18:07.490 --> 18:11.483
Find him a medical bed
or release him. I'm not admitting him.

18:13.029 --> 18:14.553
End of discussion.

18:20.067 --> 18:21.125
You fell asleep?

18:21.335 --> 18:23.235
Oak Street Beach.

18:23.437 --> 18:26.200
You fell asleep in the sun?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.173
Can you sit down?

18:31.144 --> 18:32.304
I don't think so.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.237
Maybe we should lean
him against the gurney.

18:38.517 --> 18:39.641
I passed.

18:40.151 --> 18:41.140
The bar?

18:49.692 --> 18:51.216
I am so proud of you!

18:51.427 --> 18:52.587
This is heartwarming...

18:52.794 --> 18:54.762
...but can I get some help here?

18:56.931 --> 18:59.091
- Can you take vital signs?
- Sure thing.

19:11.042 --> 19:13.010
Congratulations.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.102
What are you doing?

19:17.314 --> 19:20.840
Remember the back seat
of your Celica?

19:21.051 --> 19:23.018
Remember the trip to Hawaii?

19:28.324 --> 19:31.349
You gotta get accepted
to the bar more often.

19:35.163 --> 19:37.824
Timmy, where's the car accident?

19:52.810 --> 19:54.436
Hi, Mr. Ring.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.310
I'm Dr. Benton.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.213
Is my daughter out of surgery?

19:58.415 --> 20:01.111
Not yet, but don't worry.
She's gonna be okay.

20:01.317 --> 20:03.376
We had to repair her spleen.

20:04.819 --> 20:06.912
I need to talk to you
about your wife.

20:07.589 --> 20:11.547
She's got a spinal fracture and
massive internal bleeding.

20:11.759 --> 20:13.523
She has what's called DIC.

20:13.727 --> 20:16.594
Her blood won't clot
as a result of the trauma.

20:16.796 --> 20:19.026
She's going to die.

20:19.232 --> 20:21.927
Mr. Ring...

20:22.135 --> 20:25.535
...did you and your wife ever
discuss organ donation?

21:01.133 --> 21:02.225
He needs to be admitted.

21:02.434 --> 21:04.800
- On what grounds?
- Change of mental status.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.470
He's senile, that's nothing new.

21:06.670 --> 21:08.571
Give him antibiotics, send him home.

21:08.772 --> 21:11.296
He has no one
to make sure he takes his meds...

21:11.508 --> 21:13.066
...to feed him, use the bathroom...

21:13.277 --> 21:15.005
That's what Social Services are for.

21:15.211 --> 21:17.542
- They can't see him today.
- What about Psych?

21:17.747 --> 21:20.146
Cvetic won't admit him.

21:20.349 --> 21:22.783
He can be treated as an outpatient.

21:22.985 --> 21:24.975
We don't have the beds.

21:25.187 --> 21:28.280
If Cvetic won't take him, he's out.
Thank you, Timmy.

21:34.593 --> 21:36.993
Emergency alarm's going off.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.962
Malik, grab the crash cart.
Susan, we got a mayday.

22:00.548 --> 22:02.674
I can't find my earring.

22:19.031 --> 22:22.625
Your hand was on the emergency call
button the entire time?

22:22.800 --> 22:23.789
Oh, man.

22:24.869 --> 22:26.427
I miss all the good stuff.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.103
I'm never gonna live this down.

22:28.305 --> 22:31.831
This is great. Everybody thought you
were some kind of a saint.

22:32.042 --> 22:33.872
I was gonna call you "Mahatma."

22:34.076 --> 22:35.940
What'll happen when Wertz hears?

22:36.145 --> 22:38.578
You were with your wife.
Lucky you.

22:40.048 --> 22:43.141
I'm chief resident. I'm supposed
to set a good example.

22:43.350 --> 22:46.444
It's a big hospital. Maybe Wertz
won't even hear about it.

22:46.653 --> 22:49.281
Hey, Mark.

22:49.488 --> 22:52.513
How's it hanging?

22:52.725 --> 22:54.282
I'm a dead man.

22:59.164 --> 23:00.460
Carter!

23:03.701 --> 23:06.965
Doctor, time to get up.

23:07.670 --> 23:08.967
Clear!

23:13.275 --> 23:15.243
I've got a rash.

23:18.579 --> 23:20.240
I need a doctor.

23:26.819 --> 23:29.151
- Are you a doctor?
- Me?

23:31.757 --> 23:32.916
She's got a rash.

23:34.092 --> 23:37.254
- Can you help me?
- Sure. I can try.

23:39.564 --> 23:41.531
Pressure's 70 over 50.

23:41.732 --> 23:45.132
Pulse is 120, resps 32.

23:45.335 --> 23:48.632
Temperature's 102.5.
Pulse ox...

23:48.838 --> 23:50.430
...is only 85 percent.

23:55.744 --> 23:57.677
- You her husband?
- Yes.

23:57.844 --> 24:00.472
Mr. Franks, this is Dr. Greene.

24:00.881 --> 24:03.371
What kind of medications is she on?

24:03.582 --> 24:07.985
I tried to get her to see our doctor
for weeks but she wouldn't go.

24:09.087 --> 24:10.577
Lasix, Dig, KCI...

24:10.789 --> 24:14.417
...lsordil, nitro,
captopril, Antivert...

24:14.625 --> 24:16.957
...Darvocet, Timaptic.

24:17.895 --> 24:20.590
We need a chest film,
EKG, CBC...

24:20.797 --> 24:23.197
...Chem-7, Dig level, UA...

24:23.399 --> 24:26.300
...blood cultures times two,
blood gases...

24:26.502 --> 24:29.403
...and hydrate her with a
300cc bolus of saline.

24:31.973 --> 24:33.440
Is she gonna be all right?

24:36.443 --> 24:41.141
We may have to make a difficult
choice in the next few hours.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.941
We're dealing with impending
respiratory failure.

24:47.452 --> 24:49.545
Please do everything you can.

24:50.155 --> 24:53.988
We'll get blood gases first and
then take it from there, okay?

24:54.191 --> 24:55.487
Okay.

25:13.706 --> 25:17.334
So you're in your third year
of medical school.

25:17.943 --> 25:19.172
Must be hard.

25:19.678 --> 25:21.009
It's pretty demanding.

25:22.547 --> 25:24.708
Must be very...

25:25.316 --> 25:26.374
...hard.

25:26.585 --> 25:29.052
Afternoon, Dr. Carter.

25:29.252 --> 25:30.412
Hi, Dr. Lewis.

25:30.621 --> 25:32.849
Poison ivy. Pretty nasty case.

25:33.056 --> 25:35.923
Saw lots of this when
I did my Dermatology rotation.

25:36.125 --> 25:38.719
You don't mind if I observe,
do you, doctor?

25:38.928 --> 25:40.589
He's doing fine on his own.

25:40.795 --> 25:42.262
I'm sure he is.

25:42.464 --> 25:46.093
Medrol Dosepak and
antihistamine will clear this right up.

25:51.037 --> 25:55.337
Remember the summer when Jerry
broke his arm up at the lake?

25:56.808 --> 25:58.799
And you were so worried.

25:59.010 --> 26:01.535
I told you that boys will be boys.

26:02.247 --> 26:04.908
But you pampered him.

26:05.115 --> 26:09.278
It's remarkable he turned out
as well as he did. Isn't it?

26:09.486 --> 26:10.885
Mr. Franks?

26:13.523 --> 26:17.288
I'm troubled with the results
of your wife's blood gases.

26:18.025 --> 26:19.583
How old is she?

26:21.362 --> 26:23.159
Eighty-six.

26:24.297 --> 26:26.266
Our options are limited.

26:27.334 --> 26:29.234
Her condition is terminal.

26:29.935 --> 26:33.735
If we put her on a respirator,
we may not be able to wean her off.

26:33.939 --> 26:36.964
We'd be prolonging her life
in a vegetative state.

26:38.042 --> 26:40.806
Or we can make her comfortable.

26:41.012 --> 26:44.469
Give her fluids, antibiotics...

26:44.681 --> 26:46.444
...let nature run its course.

26:47.149 --> 26:48.776
You mean let her die.

26:50.052 --> 26:51.451
She'd die in peace.

26:53.355 --> 26:55.220
Put her on the respirator.

26:57.158 --> 27:00.092
Mr. Franks, are you sure
that's what she'd want?

27:04.498 --> 27:06.829
We'll hold off until
we get another blood gas.

27:09.102 --> 27:11.831
Hopefully she'll improve
with nebulizer treatments.

27:17.775 --> 27:20.767
She has 13 grandchildren.
Did you know that?

27:24.980 --> 27:26.949
No, sir. I didn't know that.

27:29.552 --> 27:31.611
I just thought you should know.

27:46.432 --> 27:47.864
So you're finally up.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.431
What time is it?

27:49.634 --> 27:50.692
Seven-thirty.

27:51.636 --> 27:54.195
Boy, I must've really
tied one on this time.

27:54.406 --> 27:57.841
- I'll go get you a doctor.
- Thanks.

28:04.047 --> 28:05.035
Damn it!

28:05.715 --> 28:08.148
Did I get busted again?

28:08.350 --> 28:11.012
- You don't remember?
- No, not much.

28:14.889 --> 28:15.980
Am I hurt or something?

28:16.190 --> 28:19.647
The policeman went for coffee.
He'll be right back.

28:19.859 --> 28:23.022
I must've really screwed up
this time, didn't I?

28:24.697 --> 28:25.823
You hit a family.

28:26.565 --> 28:30.331
The mother's dead,
and the daughter's in Intensive Care.

28:35.606 --> 28:37.039
You ordered an angiogram?

28:37.240 --> 28:39.867
They haven't gotten to it.
Radiology's backed up.

28:40.077 --> 28:41.509
Thank God for small favors.

28:41.711 --> 28:43.371
No concern about a thrombosis?

28:43.579 --> 28:45.911
His urine came back positive.

28:46.114 --> 28:48.844
I think his pain is related
to a urinary tract infection.

28:49.049 --> 28:51.176
He had a Foley catheter in surgery.

28:51.385 --> 28:53.319
You don't think it's serious, Joe?

28:53.520 --> 28:55.919
I'll write you a prescription
and send you home.

28:56.123 --> 28:58.317
That's what he said.

28:58.791 --> 29:01.988
Excuse me, doctor. May I have
a word with you, please?

29:05.497 --> 29:08.125
I really think
you might want to reconsider.

29:08.332 --> 29:10.163
What are you, a third-year resident?

29:10.368 --> 29:12.528
Second year. Surgical resident.

29:13.871 --> 29:17.600
The next time you wanna practice
overly aggressive procedures...

29:17.807 --> 29:20.331
...do it on one of your
indigent patients.

29:20.542 --> 29:23.442
They won't know you're
showing off for students.

29:24.412 --> 29:26.141
We'll have you out in five minutes.

29:26.347 --> 29:28.541
Joe, that's great.
Thanks so much.

29:28.750 --> 29:33.413
Right in the middle of the reception
she starts puking her guts out.

29:33.620 --> 29:37.521
Honey, I'm sorry. I just...
Oh, God!

29:37.990 --> 29:39.048
There she goes again.

29:39.258 --> 29:42.351
Compazine, 10 milligrams I.M.
CBC and Chem-7.

29:42.560 --> 29:43.618
What did she eat?

29:43.828 --> 29:46.261
I don't think she ate
until the reception.

29:46.464 --> 29:47.896
Did you, honey?

29:48.499 --> 29:50.558
Everybody had the same
buffet at Gerber's.

29:50.768 --> 29:54.669
You're holding your reception at
Gerber's Hofbrau House on 46th?

29:54.871 --> 29:57.668
That's where those German
tourists ate.

29:57.874 --> 29:59.363
How many guests at your wedding?

29:59.575 --> 30:01.371
Couple of hundred.

30:01.576 --> 30:03.100
I'll get more emesis basins.

30:03.310 --> 30:05.505
She's become a little more lucid.

30:05.713 --> 30:08.510
Have her blood gases improved?

30:08.715 --> 30:11.741
PCO-2's up to 70. She's tiring.

30:19.424 --> 30:20.413
She's getting better.

30:24.495 --> 30:27.623
Your wife was dehydrated, Mr. Franks.

30:27.831 --> 30:30.264
She woke because we gave her fluids.

30:30.466 --> 30:33.299
Her respiratory problem is worsening.

30:36.638 --> 30:38.162
I'm very tired.

30:39.641 --> 30:40.801
I know, dear.

30:41.875 --> 30:43.570
Are you in any pain?

30:43.777 --> 30:45.802
I'm dying, aren't I, doctor?

30:46.013 --> 30:47.742
No, you're gonna be fine.

30:53.486 --> 30:55.476
Mrs. Franks.

30:55.687 --> 30:59.316
You are not gonna be able
to continue breathing on your own...

30:59.523 --> 31:00.855
...for very much longer.

31:01.792 --> 31:05.591
Do you want us to put you on
a machine to help you breathe?

31:05.795 --> 31:06.921
Yes. She does.

31:07.130 --> 31:09.290
I'm asking your wife, Mr. Franks.

31:12.634 --> 31:15.364
- For how long?
- I don't know.

31:15.738 --> 31:17.295
We've already discussed this!

31:25.612 --> 31:28.444
I don't want you to go.

31:28.647 --> 31:30.274
Oh, I know.

31:37.655 --> 31:40.088
It's okay, darling.

31:59.206 --> 32:01.037
A couple of hundred?

32:01.241 --> 32:05.370
But not everybody had the potato
salad. Only about 60 are sick.

32:06.578 --> 32:08.443
Connie! Thank God!

32:08.647 --> 32:11.980
I've never been so glad
to see anybody in my whole life.

32:12.183 --> 32:13.946
Good night, everybody!

32:15.685 --> 32:18.586
Just keep your head down.
We'll be with you soon.

32:20.923 --> 32:22.515
Not everybody gets Compazine.

32:22.726 --> 32:26.183
D5, NS IVs if they look like
they need it, okay?

32:26.896 --> 32:29.091
Yeah, I'm holding.

32:29.297 --> 32:30.889
- What was that?
- Accordions.

32:31.099 --> 32:34.556
Their wedding reception's
in our waiting room. 'Night!

32:35.068 --> 32:36.501
Dr. Lewis.

32:36.737 --> 32:38.067
I need you.

32:41.741 --> 32:44.937
They found him walking down
the middle of Halsted, naked.

32:45.144 --> 32:47.839
He was still wearing
his hospital bracelet.

32:48.046 --> 32:50.673
Hey, Victor.

32:50.882 --> 32:53.941
My dogs. I have to feed my dogs.

32:54.151 --> 32:55.311
I know you do.

32:55.519 --> 32:56.508
Should I get Cvetic?

32:56.686 --> 32:59.813
No. I want you to take him
to Psych Services, now.

33:00.023 --> 33:01.319
What if they won't accept him?

33:01.523 --> 33:03.582
Then I'll sign him
into Cvetic's service.

33:12.966 --> 33:14.024
How you holding up?

33:14.235 --> 33:17.260
I'll make it, I'm off in
three hours. You on tonight?

33:17.469 --> 33:19.266
No. Benton.

33:19.471 --> 33:22.132
Talk to Doug about Hathaway.
It's been two months.

33:22.341 --> 33:25.105
I did. I even offered
to drive him out there.

33:25.310 --> 33:28.403
Why is he acting like this?
They were together two years.

33:28.613 --> 33:32.104
He feels guilty.
He thinks it's his fault.

33:32.316 --> 33:35.284
I guess things are better
with you and Jennifer, huh?

33:39.155 --> 33:42.612
She passed her bar. She was excited.

33:44.259 --> 33:46.624
So were you, from what I could see.

33:49.763 --> 33:52.322
So what happens next?
She gets a job?

33:52.533 --> 33:53.931
She's looking.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.668
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

33:59.872 --> 34:02.272
Do not admit a patient
to my service without a consult.

34:02.474 --> 34:03.872
He needs psychiatric help.

34:04.076 --> 34:06.509
- Not in my opinion.
- He was found naked on Halsted.

34:06.710 --> 34:09.304
- He's senile, not psychotic!
- He needs care.

34:09.512 --> 34:12.675
- Admit him to your service.
- Wertz wouldn't let me.

34:17.585 --> 34:19.849
Don't ever do that to me again.

34:34.367 --> 34:35.732
Dr. Benton?

34:37.803 --> 34:40.565
I'm sorry about what happened
with the thrombosis patient.

34:41.071 --> 34:42.800
I think you were right.

34:44.042 --> 34:45.735
Is that so?

34:45.976 --> 34:47.534
He should've had the angiogram.

34:48.511 --> 34:50.239
Great.

34:50.446 --> 34:53.676
<i>I'll be sure to notify the
New England Journal of Medicine.</i>

35:48.828 --> 35:50.192
Doug Ross needs you.

35:50.395 --> 35:51.487
What's up?

35:51.697 --> 35:53.528
Mrs. Franks died.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.973
<i>For you're the lover
I've been waiting for</i>

36:09.378 --> 36:11.311
<i>The mate that fate had me...</i>

36:12.480 --> 36:13.913
<i>... created for</i>

36:15.149 --> 36:17.481
<i>And every time your lips...</i>

36:19.619 --> 36:20.676
<i>... meet mine</i>

36:22.254 --> 36:27.123
<i>Darling, down and down I go</i>

36:28.560 --> 36:31.461
<i>Round and round I go</i>

36:32.596 --> 36:34.121
<i>In a spin</i>

36:37.534 --> 36:39.433
<i>Loving the spin I'm in</i>

36:41.838 --> 36:43.532
<i>Under That Old...</i>

36:43.740 --> 36:47.675
<i>... Black Magic...</i>

36:47.876 --> 36:52.505
<i>... called love</i>

38:08.642 --> 38:11.042
- She asleep?
- Finally.

38:13.446 --> 38:15.779
I'm proud of you, counselor.

38:15.981 --> 38:18.005
Never thought I'd make it, huh?

38:19.819 --> 38:21.911
I knew you'd make it.

38:25.557 --> 38:27.252
I miss you.

38:29.926 --> 38:31.757
I miss you too.

38:34.864 --> 38:36.763
We have to make love more often.

38:41.335 --> 38:43.633
The look on your face!

38:43.839 --> 38:45.829
It was a little embarrassing.

38:52.945 --> 38:55.709
We could pick up where we left off.

38:55.914 --> 38:57.882
What if Rachel wakes up?

38:58.817 --> 39:00.249
We could stay out here.

39:00.452 --> 39:01.577
In the yard?

39:02.720 --> 39:04.620
If Mrs. Navrocki sees us?

39:04.821 --> 39:07.119
What if she did, huh?

39:11.093 --> 39:14.460
I have to be back in the hospital
in two hours, Jen.

39:20.168 --> 39:21.794
I'm sorry.

39:33.745 --> 39:35.906
You're never gonna leave, are you?

39:41.785 --> 39:43.308
The hospital.

39:53.494 --> 39:55.189
I don't know.

39:59.133 --> 40:01.032
I need you, Mark.

40:08.908 --> 40:10.307
I love you.

41:02.986 --> 41:04.816
- How did you get...
- Let's go.

41:05.020 --> 41:06.920
- Where?
- Your place.

41:07.989 --> 41:09.081
I live with my folks.

41:09.791 --> 41:11.258
My place, then.

41:33.110 --> 41:36.545
What are we there for, if we
can't keep a 75-year-old man...

41:36.746 --> 41:39.840
...from wandering around
the North Side naked?

41:41.683 --> 41:45.312
I just get so frustrated sometimes,
you know. I just...

41:46.187 --> 41:47.950
...wanna scream.

41:50.957 --> 41:53.425
You can't solve all
the world's problems.

41:53.627 --> 41:56.527
That's what Wertz said.

41:56.730 --> 41:59.527
Well, he's very wise.

41:59.732 --> 42:04.293
Listen, you have to be very careful
how you deal with consults.

42:05.003 --> 42:07.062
You can get yourself in real trouble.

42:07.272 --> 42:09.466
I just wanna make a difference.

42:11.008 --> 42:14.444
Yeah, well, you also wanna
have a career.

42:14.644 --> 42:18.671
And not everybody's gonna be as
understanding as I was.

42:19.481 --> 42:22.678
Yeah, you're real understanding.

42:22.884 --> 42:25.375
That's one of my best qualities.

42:25.586 --> 42:28.077
Well, one of them.

43:12.625 --> 43:14.183
Hello, Helen.

43:16.896 --> 43:17.919
Can I come in?

43:18.863 --> 43:20.831
No, you can't.

43:21.098 --> 43:23.191
Go away. Please.

43:24.301 --> 43:25.598
Who is it, Mama?

43:26.070 --> 43:27.934
I asked him to leave.

43:28.237 --> 43:30.137
It's okay, Mama.

43:49.655 --> 43:51.213
You look beautiful.

44:02.232 --> 44:03.631
How've you been?

44:04.800 --> 44:06.166
Okay.

44:08.371 --> 44:10.862
I just came by to see you.

44:11.072 --> 44:12.835
Say hi.

44:14.309 --> 44:16.276
It's good to see you.

44:22.149 --> 44:23.275
Take care.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.403
Dr. Benton?

44:54.040 --> 44:56.009
- What is it?
- EMTs are on their way.

44:56.209 --> 44:58.541
They think it's a ruptured bowel.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.469
What's the pulse?

45:02.681 --> 45:05.650
Pulse is 140. Pressure 60 over 40.

45:05.984 --> 45:08.919
We've been pumping in fluids.
He's had 1500cc's.

45:09.120 --> 45:11.020
Abdomen's rigid, extremely tender.

45:11.221 --> 45:13.348
Says he was here today
with a thrombosis.

45:13.557 --> 45:15.616
Let's get a CBC.
Type and cross six units.

45:15.825 --> 45:20.524
Let's drop an NG. Call the O.R., tell
them to prep for an exploratory lap.

45:20.730 --> 45:23.392
All right, people, come on!
We've done this before.

45:23.598 --> 45:26.066
Camacho, I got him.
Let's get him in close.

45:26.268 --> 45:28.668
Listen, don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

45:28.869 --> 45:30.269
All right, we've done it before.

45:30.471 --> 45:34.407
Here we go.
One, two, three! Let's go!

45:34.842 --> 45:37.435
All right, clear.
Let's move, people!

45:37.644 --> 45:38.975
Here we go.

45:39.178 --> 45:42.841
All right, I need to drop an NG.
Let's get a chest x-ray...

45:43.048 --> 45:46.039
...and abdominal.
Make it a portable. Let's move!
