00:07.920 --> 00:09.966
â™ª

00:10.097 --> 00:11.620
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm Red Bill.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.361
We don't like bounty hunters
around here.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.102
Red: I'm lookin' for a fella
carries a Bowie knife

00:15.232 --> 00:17.060
with an Eye of Gorgon
in the handle.

00:17.191 --> 00:19.541
Man: And I'll have the gold
and you'll die of thirst

00:19.671 --> 00:22.544
waiting for your God
to make it rain.I'm not leaving.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.285
When you leave town,
I'll give you back your gun.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.287
Woman:
You're beautiful, powerful,

00:26.417 --> 00:28.289
and I've never seen you
give up on anything.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.552
You and I are destined for
better things.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.683
Man #2:
That's a robbery gone bad.

00:32.815 --> 00:34.860
Where's my horse?

00:34.991 --> 00:35.992
This your horse?

00:36.123 --> 00:37.167
Fuck you!

00:44.783 --> 00:47.917
[suspenseful music]

00:51.616 --> 00:54.271
[Bill panting]

00:55.229 --> 00:58.406
[suspenseful music]

01:16.771 --> 01:18.208
[Bill screaming]

01:20.819 --> 01:24.301
[suspenseful music]

01:26.608 --> 01:29.132
[water dripping]

01:30.873 --> 01:34.223
[suspenseful music]

03:06.098 --> 03:08.231
[horse neighing]

03:08.362 --> 03:10.668
[upbeat music]

03:10.799 --> 03:13.715
[horse galloping]

03:13.845 --> 03:16.761
[upbeat music]

03:49.403 --> 03:50.447
[Kurt] We're probably
turning around,

03:50.578 --> 03:53.581
we've been here for hours.

03:53.711 --> 03:56.758
Come on Kurt, just a
little bit further.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.238
Oh come on, Mac.

03:59.369 --> 04:00.718
Forget about him.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.504
We've got more pressing
things to care of.

04:03.634 --> 04:06.158
Once a man breaks the law,

04:06.289 --> 04:08.073
he's gotta be
brought to justice.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.162
[Kurt] What law is that?

04:10.293 --> 04:11.207
Stealing from another man.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.383
Mac, you and I both know,

04:13.514 --> 04:15.951
the further we are
from that money,

04:16.081 --> 04:18.127
the more likely it is someone
will to stumble across it.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.389
I love that horse.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.174
More than money?

04:24.307 --> 04:25.526
That's what I thought.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.269
Paranoia, that's it.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.230
Paranoia does not make
you smarter, Kurt.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.971
It just makes you look

04:36.101 --> 04:37.712
like you wanna shit
yourself all the time.

04:39.801 --> 04:42.499
[horse neighing]

04:45.763 --> 04:47.939
Careful, it's supposed
to be a straight line.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.514
He says you have no imagination.

04:58.907 --> 04:59.821
Really?

04:59.951 --> 05:01.562
You know a better way to farm?

05:04.260 --> 05:05.522
Come here and show me.

05:05.653 --> 05:08.264
Come on, come and show me.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.484
Here you go.
Here we go.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.355
[Steve laughing]

05:12.486 --> 05:15.271
You know a better
way to farm, hah?

05:15.402 --> 05:18.230
All right, children,
that's enough.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.407
Who you calling child, hah?

05:20.537 --> 05:22.278
Who you calling child?

05:22.409 --> 05:24.149
Hah, who you calling child?

05:24.280 --> 05:27.109
[all laughing]

05:29.546 --> 05:32.419
Get back to work.
Go back to work.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.599
Where is your crucifix?

05:40.470 --> 05:41.819
I don't know.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.126
I must've lost it.

05:45.867 --> 05:49.523
Here, take mine.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.612
Your prayers have
more power anyway.

05:51.742 --> 05:52.613
That's not true.

05:53.657 --> 05:54.397
That is not true.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.270
[horse neighing]

05:58.401 --> 06:00.490
[Michelle] Look, the
settlers are coming.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.016
[Steve] They are
headed from Greenvale.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.500
She'd use the knife.

06:11.806 --> 06:12.850
All right.

06:15.331 --> 06:16.637
Up to the corners then,

06:18.247 --> 06:19.596
right the way she did.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.079
Here you go.

06:30.041 --> 06:35.307
So, you going have
a new momma soon.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.615
Does that make you happy?

06:39.964 --> 06:40.878
Will I like her?

06:41.009 --> 06:42.663
Of course you will.

06:42.793 --> 06:45.361
You and her have
so much in common.

06:45.492 --> 06:46.623
Like what?

06:46.754 --> 06:49.626
Well, she's really kind

06:49.757 --> 06:51.193
and she's really pretty.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.196
Would you like to meet her?

06:54.326 --> 06:55.197
Yeah?

06:55.327 --> 06:58.113
-When?
-Know what?

06:58.243 --> 06:59.201
This very day.

06:59.331 --> 07:02.204
[horses neighing]

07:06.817 --> 07:08.340
[Wanda] This ain't gonna work.

07:08.471 --> 07:09.298
[Symone] You're a defeatist,
Wanda, it'll work.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.560
[Wanda] What's a defeatist?

07:11.953 --> 07:13.215
[All] Surprise.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.875
What's going on?

07:21.005 --> 07:21.832
It's not my birthday.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.747
It is a special occasion.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.096
You don't know what
I'm talking about?

07:25.227 --> 07:26.489
Yes I do, but as I recall,

07:26.620 --> 07:28.926
that was a little
before your time.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.537
But that doesn't stop her

07:30.667 --> 07:32.713
from telling us about
it twice a week.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.149
[all laughing]

07:34.279 --> 07:35.759
That's because
it's so thrilling.

07:35.890 --> 07:36.673
You kicking that vicious
asshole out of here

07:36.804 --> 07:38.153
and taking over yourself.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.155
Humiliating him the way you did.

07:40.284 --> 07:42.244
If I had my way today'd
be national holiday.

07:42.374 --> 07:43.550
[Eve] And what's this?

07:43.680 --> 07:44.681
It's a gift.

07:46.988 --> 07:50.644
-Well, thank you, girls.
-Open it.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.473
[gentle music]

07:58.826 --> 08:00.741
Remember the day at the store?

08:00.871 --> 08:02.090
I do.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.527
We knew it was love
at first sight.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.181
Now, aren't you the sly ones.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.705
[all laughing]

08:10.881 --> 08:15.973
So, Eve, given we got
Barnaby to lower the price

08:18.802 --> 08:20.761
of his water last night,

08:20.891 --> 08:23.764
and since it's a
special occasion,

08:25.069 --> 08:26.636
why don't we take the day off?

08:28.290 --> 08:29.987
Take the day off?

08:30.118 --> 08:32.076
Yeah, celebrate.

08:32.207 --> 08:33.861
Have dinner at the restaurant
in Charming, maybe.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.341
Or go to that fancy
hotel like the last time.

08:36.472 --> 08:37.778
Ladies.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.126
Or even just stay right
here and get drunk

08:39.256 --> 08:40.302
and stay up all night.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.347
Not today, I'm sorry.

08:42.477 --> 08:44.044
[Wanda] Why not?

08:44.174 --> 08:46.003
The settler convoys are due.

08:46.134 --> 08:49.137
That's a month's potential
earnings in two or three days.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.094
It's no possible.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.661
Oh, come on, Eve.

08:52.967 --> 08:58.842
Bring the water inside.

08:58.973 --> 09:01.149
Ladies.

09:01.279 --> 09:03.891
[gentle music]

09:10.158 --> 09:12.290
[horses neighing]

09:12.421 --> 09:14.031
What are you doing here?

09:14.162 --> 09:15.642
Where's Symone?

09:15.772 --> 09:16.860
[Susan] We're a little
busy this morning.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.383
-I just need a minute.
-Who's there?

09:18.514 --> 09:21.125
-[Nathan] Hey.
-[Symone] Hey.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.432
-[Susan] Hey, what the hell?
-What's going on here?

09:27.175 --> 09:29.960
[Nathan] I just wanted a
little time with Symone.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.483
I know it's early, but.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.834
-It's okay, Eve.
-No, it's not okay.

09:33.964 --> 09:36.010
Get the hell out of here.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.185
[Nathan] What?

09:37.315 --> 09:38.708
We're closed today.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.015
I'm taking the
girls out of town.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.844
And in future, when one of
them tells you to get out,

09:43.974 --> 09:44.845
you obey her.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.022
Excuse me?

09:48.152 --> 09:49.240
You heard me.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.677
Now go.

09:53.462 --> 09:56.030
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

09:56.160 --> 09:59.207
The only reason you get to
do what you do around here

09:59.337 --> 10:00.512
is 'cause of this,

10:01.949 --> 10:03.994
you understand?

10:04.125 --> 10:06.518
Take your goddamn
hand off me, Nathan.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.610
I made no agreement
with a piece of tin.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.438
Or with you.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.876
My arrangement is with McCoy.

10:16.006 --> 10:17.268
He ain't gonna like this.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.879
Well, when he gets back,

10:19.009 --> 10:20.228
we'll see if he
does or he doesn't,

10:20.358 --> 10:26.060
but until then,
stay away from here.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.627
Leave.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.765
[horses neighing]

10:40.030 --> 10:41.728
I say we head for the bridge.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.819
This whole thing about pride.

10:45.949 --> 10:48.169
And I ain't overly keen
on getting killed for it.

10:48.299 --> 10:49.866
You're scared.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.304
[horse neighing]

10:53.435 --> 10:54.915
You should be too.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.699
He's a fucking nut job
with nothing to lose.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.050
Whereas you and me,

11:00.181 --> 11:02.313
we're risking hundreds
of thousand of dollars.

11:04.620 --> 11:05.490
Nope.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.275
We're gonna cross that bridge.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.755
[Kurt laughing]

11:08.885 --> 11:10.408
[Kurt] Are you
fucking kidding me?

11:10.539 --> 11:11.932
Where are you going?

11:12.062 --> 11:13.934
I'm going back to town.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.370
And if you ain't back by
tomorrow, I'm taking my share.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.068
You don't touch that
money, you understand?

11:18.199 --> 11:20.157
Hey.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.724
You stop, that's an order.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.596
Oh really?

11:25.162 --> 11:26.337
From who?

11:26.468 --> 11:28.513
The Sheriff or the outlaw?

11:28.644 --> 11:29.732
That makes no difference.

11:31.952 --> 11:34.389
The penalty for disobeying
it'll be the same.

11:34.519 --> 11:37.609
[suspenseful music]

11:54.452 --> 11:55.976
[laughing]

11:56.106 --> 11:57.847
You son of bitch.

12:00.241 --> 12:01.546
You're scared by the
boy with the bag,

12:01.677 --> 12:03.635
and you pull that thing on me.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.684
You have seen
enough death, Kurt.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.948
I bet you remember every one.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.907
That look of bafflement
on their face,

12:14.037 --> 12:15.735
their eyes squinted
towards the sun.

12:17.867 --> 12:21.349
[wind gushing]

12:21.479 --> 12:24.656
[suspenseful music]

12:53.990 --> 12:55.992
What do you want from me?

12:56.123 --> 12:57.777
You don't know what
you missed, Bill.

12:59.387 --> 13:00.562
It was really tender.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.654
Maggots have more goddamn sense.

13:07.830 --> 13:11.007
And you would have regained
some much-needed strength.

13:11.138 --> 13:12.792
Tell me what you want.

13:15.533 --> 13:19.015
[suspenseful music]

13:23.846 --> 13:25.935
This is tribal medicine, right?

13:28.808 --> 13:29.852
Yes?

13:33.551 --> 13:34.726
Did you live with them?

13:36.511 --> 13:38.339
[Bill] Fuck you.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.080
You are a gift, Bill.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.866
Fate has brought you to me.

13:47.304 --> 13:52.266
You and your beautiful,
beautiful bag of heads.

13:57.532 --> 14:02.711
Tell me, I have to know how
many you have inside you.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.064
Do you see them when you sleep?

14:09.283 --> 14:10.762
Why would I see 'em?

14:12.199 --> 14:14.331
Do you hear their voices?

14:14.462 --> 14:17.552
[suspenseful music]

14:18.683 --> 14:20.729
Mine live inside me.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.776
I hear their laughter,

14:26.169 --> 14:27.301
their tears,

14:28.606 --> 14:30.782
their conversations.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.308
They're my family.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.878
[suspenseful music]

14:41.315 --> 14:44.971
And this blood belongs to
the last one who joined us.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.023
So, how many, Bill?

14:55.633 --> 14:57.200
Fuck you.

14:57.331 --> 15:01.509
You're all gonna be one
great big family, Bill.

15:01.639 --> 15:04.904
[suspenseful music]

15:32.888 --> 15:34.150
Steve?

15:37.327 --> 15:39.199
I need someone to
hear my confession.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.332
Could you do that?

15:42.463 --> 15:43.420
I think only priests are allowed

15:43.551 --> 15:44.900
to hear confession, honey.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.076
Well, you're the nearest
thing to it here.

15:50.558 --> 15:51.646
All right.

16:06.791 --> 16:10.665
I find that I'm frightened
a lot these days

16:13.363 --> 16:17.106
and angry.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.767
But, mostly, what I believe
feeling a lot of the time

16:25.897 --> 16:27.421
is despair.

16:33.165 --> 16:35.342
I find myself wishing we could
join one of those convoys

16:35.472 --> 16:37.909
and head south to a land
that doesn't break our backs

16:38.040 --> 16:39.040
and our spirits every year

16:39.172 --> 16:41.217
with its refusal
to provide us rain.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.090
And,

16:47.441 --> 16:50.226
I've begun to feel as
though God has abandoned us

16:52.011 --> 16:53.751
because I can't feel
his presence any more.

16:53.882 --> 16:54.839
It's okay.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.276
-It's not.
-it's okay.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.408
It's not, I feel so unworthy.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.845
[gentle music]

17:00.976 --> 17:03.283
Listen, listen me, listen to me.

17:04.980 --> 17:09.463
God is wherever suffering is.

17:09.593 --> 17:12.291
[gentle music]

17:12.422 --> 17:15.469
And your doubt only
reinforces his presence.

17:15.598 --> 17:18.385
[gentle music]

17:19.429 --> 17:21.257
Do you understand?

17:21.387 --> 17:24.173
[gentle music]

17:45.281 --> 17:47.109
I'm gonna fix this, Michelle.

17:48.502 --> 17:51.809
[gentle music]

17:51.940 --> 17:53.289
All of it.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.163
[horse neighing]

17:58.207 --> 18:00.775
[gentle music]

18:03.169 --> 18:04.779
[both laughing]

18:04.909 --> 18:06.476
[Lady] This is gonna be great.

18:06.607 --> 18:07.825
I plan to be drunk from
the start of this day

18:07.956 --> 18:08.696
-to the very end.
-Here we go.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.524
[all laughing]

18:10.654 --> 18:13.527
[horse neighing]

18:16.617 --> 18:17.574
Eve.

18:20.186 --> 18:24.059
Why did you speak
to Nathan like that?

18:24.190 --> 18:27.367
Why didn't you tell me he
asked you to marry him?

18:27.497 --> 18:29.456
I need to know when
these things happen.

18:30.892 --> 18:31.893
Well, now you do.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.114
Are you thinking about it?

18:36.680 --> 18:37.333
No.

18:37.464 --> 18:39.074
Good.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.945
He isn't good enough for you.

18:41.076 --> 18:42.338
Why not?

18:43.209 --> 18:45.559
He's young, handsome,

18:45.689 --> 18:48.605
makes all this a
little bit enjoyable.

18:48.736 --> 18:52.566
[ladies talking indistinctly]

19:01.488 --> 19:02.402
[Eve] Ladies.

19:05.927 --> 19:09.496
[horse hooves clopping]

19:20.550 --> 19:22.683
Where are you going?

19:22.813 --> 19:25.816
Taking the girls to Treson Lake.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.818
The most beautiful
place in the world.

19:30.952 --> 19:34.390
[horse hooves clopping]

19:36.784 --> 19:37.785
I'll talk to him.

19:37.915 --> 19:39.874
[horse neighing]

19:40.004 --> 19:41.484
I'll convince McCoy to
get you your horses.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.704
No, no, no, there's no need.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.620
Everything's clear to me now.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.448
I'm gonna try and recruit
some labor in town,

19:48.578 --> 19:50.276
among the settlers.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.147
There's gotta be
someone willing to help.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.454
I'm willing to help.

19:57.805 --> 19:58.849
Come by tomorrow.

19:59.807 --> 20:04.899
I can't.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.117
I have to go.

20:07.815 --> 20:10.992
[suspenseful music]

20:27.617 --> 20:30.272
[McCoy] They say your life
flash before your eyes

20:31.447 --> 20:33.536
the moment you die.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.930
Is that what happened
to you back there?

20:36.060 --> 20:38.193
[Kurt] Nothing scares
you, though, right?

20:38.324 --> 20:40.108
[McCoy] Nothing much.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.284
[Kurt] What about the man
who gave you those scars?

20:42.415 --> 20:44.417
[McCoy] just shut the fuck up.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.288
[horse neighing]

20:46.419 --> 20:48.421
[Kurt] You're a runner, Mac.

20:48.551 --> 20:49.770
You came to
Greenvale on the run,

20:49.900 --> 20:51.728
and now you try
to run away again.

20:53.513 --> 20:57.430
I just wonder if that's
who you're running from.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.519
[McCoy] You don't know
what you're talking about.

21:00.868 --> 21:01.956
[Kurt] No, I don't.

21:06.003 --> 21:08.702
I've heard about every
shitty thing in your life.

21:08.832 --> 21:13.359
But those scars of yours,
not a goddamn word.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.622
Because for three men
can keep a secret,

21:17.885 --> 21:19.103
two of them have gotta be dead.

21:19.234 --> 21:22.324
[suspenseful music]

21:26.023 --> 21:28.025
[horse neighing]

21:28.156 --> 21:30.985
[upbeat music]

21:31.115 --> 21:33.335
[rocks crashing]

21:33.466 --> 21:36.207
[upbeat music]

21:40.211 --> 21:42.344
[horse neighing]

21:42.475 --> 21:45.216
[upbeat music]

21:57.968 --> 22:02.582
[Butler] May the eye bless
all those who see through it.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.801
May it light their way.

22:04.932 --> 22:08.022
[suspenseful music]

24:03.485 --> 24:06.575
"To retire is not to flee.

24:06.706 --> 24:11.711
"There is no wisdom in waiting
when danger outweighs hope."

24:16.063 --> 24:17.368
We're just about the
only two who could read

24:17.499 --> 24:20.763
in that town of illiterates.

24:20.894 --> 24:23.374
That was always your
favorite book as a child.

24:25.464 --> 24:29.598
No wonder you found
your own Don Quixote.

24:32.862 --> 24:35.343
You know your
neighbor Mr. Hagan,

24:35.474 --> 24:37.867
he's about to sign
his land over to me.

24:37.998 --> 24:41.610
Didn't even double my offer,
unlike with your husband.

24:43.438 --> 24:46.746
Are you aware he came to
confront me in my own home?

24:50.227 --> 24:53.840
He's a man of faith.

24:53.970 --> 24:57.365
He's more determined than
you could ever imagine.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.367
I have a kind of faith too.

25:00.368 --> 25:01.717
In science.

25:01.848 --> 25:04.415
So you two do have
something in common,

25:04.546 --> 25:07.114
you both have faith in
something invisible.

25:07.244 --> 25:09.420
-Yeah.
-[Thompson laughing]

25:09.551 --> 25:10.987
Not entirely invisible.

25:12.206 --> 25:14.687
I have surveys

25:14.817 --> 25:17.646
and they show that we
have not run out of gold.

25:19.256 --> 25:20.649
And what has he got?

25:23.696 --> 25:25.219
Stealing my husband's horses

25:25.349 --> 25:28.222
isn't gonna persuade
him to leave this place.

25:28.352 --> 25:30.311
Just as it wouldn't
persuade you.

25:35.490 --> 25:40.756
So give me permission
to push him harder.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.808
[gentle music]

25:54.770 --> 25:56.380
All right.

25:56.511 --> 25:57.817
Jesus.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.214
All the suffering
he's put you through

26:04.345 --> 26:07.261
and you still have to
think before you answer.

26:09.393 --> 26:13.267
Dorian, Steve and I
are a family, Charles.

26:13.397 --> 26:16.705
And once I get him away from
here, he'll remember that.

26:17.488 --> 26:20.666
[gentle music]

26:23.233 --> 26:24.713
So where can I find him?

26:27.368 --> 26:28.543
[birds chirping]

26:28.674 --> 26:29.849
[Steve] I found
this place for us.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.241
[birds chirping]

26:31.372 --> 26:33.635
[gentle music]

26:41.382 --> 26:43.427
[Eve laughing]

26:43.558 --> 26:46.605
[gentle music]

26:47.780 --> 26:49.085
Let's go for a swim.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.304
-Swim?
-Yeah.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.785
-A swim?
-[Eve laughing]

26:52.915 --> 26:55.309
[gentle music]

26:55.439 --> 26:57.833
[Susan] Was there
really water here?

26:57.964 --> 26:59.182
Oui.

26:59.313 --> 27:00.183
That's right.

27:00.314 --> 27:03.317
[gentle music]

27:07.234 --> 27:10.716
[Wanda] He's pumping away,
his monkey paws on my ass.

27:10.846 --> 27:13.240
And he starts moaning
his wife's name,

27:13.370 --> 27:15.677
-"Oh, Sarah, oh, Sarah."
-Oh shit.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.505
And I'm just thinking,
Jesus Christ,

27:17.636 --> 27:18.898
if you've gotta fantasize
about your wife,

27:19.028 --> 27:20.247
why don't you just
go home and fuck her?

27:20.377 --> 27:21.074
[all laughing]

27:21.204 --> 27:22.902
Be cheaper.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.904
Look, Symone's got
the best of us anyway.

27:25.034 --> 27:27.820
None of 'em register
compared to her beau.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.865
-Maybe.
-[Lise] Is that right?

27:29.996 --> 27:31.693
How is he in bed, Symone?

27:31.824 --> 27:33.564
Is he hung like a stallion?

27:33.695 --> 27:35.741
What a question, Jesus.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.873
-Come on.
-Tell us.

27:39.309 --> 27:40.876
Okay.

27:42.443 --> 27:44.445
He's the only one who's
ever made me come.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.885
I don't know maybe
it's the kisses,

27:50.016 --> 27:52.975
the gifts,
the promises he made me.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.673
And what about when he comes?

27:57.327 --> 27:58.894
Does he look you in the eyes?

28:01.244 --> 28:03.116
[wind gushing]

28:03.246 --> 28:06.728
He shoves your face away
so he doesn't have to.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.904
Which is all men like him want.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.218
[birds chirping]

28:18.348 --> 28:21.395
[wind gushing]

28:25.486 --> 28:27.706
It's been a while
since we hung someone.

28:30.447 --> 28:32.406
I'd sure like to
se Eve swinging.

28:34.277 --> 28:36.453
Then we'd see who's in
goddamn charge around here.

28:36.584 --> 28:38.194
I mean, what the
hell makes her think

28:38.325 --> 28:39.761
she can talk to me like that?

28:39.892 --> 28:43.939
Listen to me, you ain't
gonna do a goddamn thing.

28:44.070 --> 28:47.073
Now, I feel for you,
cuz, I really do.

28:47.203 --> 28:50.990
But what you did to your
wife, that can't happen again.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.471
-Fuck you, Henry.
-You need to calm down.

28:54.602 --> 28:57.910
I'm not always gonna be there
to get you out of trouble.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.347
And you got a daughter
to think of, Christ sake.

29:00.477 --> 29:01.870
You got Mary.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.222
All right.

29:07.528 --> 29:09.399
All right.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.489
Good.

29:12.620 --> 29:13.882
Let's get this done.

29:24.110 --> 29:26.895
[flies buzzing]

29:32.945 --> 29:35.991
[door screeching]

29:59.972 --> 30:01.625
I know you see 'em at night.

30:01.756 --> 30:02.844
I don't see shit.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.454
And I killed 'em for money.

30:04.585 --> 30:05.804
No, no, no.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.633
There's gotta be more.

30:09.764 --> 30:12.811
[suspenseful music]

30:15.030 --> 30:16.249
There ain't.

30:16.379 --> 30:18.817
[Bill screaming]

30:26.259 --> 30:28.217
Some people throw
up when I do this.

30:28.348 --> 30:31.612
[suspenseful music]

30:36.486 --> 30:39.968
[Bill] What the
hell are you doing?

30:41.404 --> 30:44.103
[bill screaming]

30:44.233 --> 30:45.321
Others,

30:46.801 --> 30:49.412
beg me to crush their skulls

30:49.543 --> 30:51.675
to stop the pain.

30:51.806 --> 30:54.548
Because your eardrums
are gonna burst

30:54.678 --> 30:57.551
and your blood's gonna
spill from out of your eyes.

31:01.468 --> 31:06.038
Come sundown, your
meat'll be tender

31:06.168 --> 31:09.258
and that's when I'll
allow you to die.

31:09.389 --> 31:12.435
[suspenseful music]

31:14.089 --> 31:17.136
[Bill gasping]

31:17.266 --> 31:20.356
[suspenseful music]

31:31.019 --> 31:33.761
[Bill gasping]

31:37.199 --> 31:39.201
Now,

31:39.332 --> 31:44.076
let's see if this
helps our conversation.

31:44.206 --> 31:48.167
What you've seen so far
might not seem promising.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.605
I know you've suffered already,

31:52.736 --> 31:53.912
I know you're tired,

31:54.825 --> 31:56.131
hungry,

31:57.480 --> 32:00.179
broke.

32:00.309 --> 32:04.400
But on the other hand,
God brought you here.

32:04.531 --> 32:07.229
I'm just a farmer
making a simple offer.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.536
How many of you are
going to Wildseek?

32:09.666 --> 32:11.190
One,

32:11.320 --> 32:12.539
2,000?

32:12.669 --> 32:15.194
[Woman] Well, we've been
offered a 160 acres.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.284
Okay.

32:18.414 --> 32:21.417
Well, I've seen a lot of
people return, disappointed,

32:22.941 --> 32:25.465
embittered, broken.

32:25.595 --> 32:28.120
[Man] Just tell us what it
is you're trying to sell.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.860
I'm looking for laborers.

32:31.906 --> 32:34.343
Men and women of faith.

32:34.474 --> 32:38.913
What I can offer is land,
right here, right now.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.655
Whatever you grow
on it, it's yours.

32:41.785 --> 32:45.050
As long as you're
willing to die of thirst.

32:45.180 --> 32:46.877
You know there's no water here.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.183
Mind your own
business, Thompson.

32:48.314 --> 32:49.402
Well, it's the truth.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.970
It's gonna rain, tomorrow,

32:52.709 --> 32:53.884
maybe even today.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.759
And how do you know that, Steve?

33:00.935 --> 33:03.416
Well, go ahead, tell
'em, how you know it.

33:08.203 --> 33:10.031
God told him it would.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.079
He gave him visions

33:14.209 --> 33:17.038
of a lush and
fruitful Greenvale.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.261
My father was born here.

33:23.523 --> 33:24.828
He adopted me,

33:24.959 --> 33:27.701
and that gave me
the right to study.

33:27.831 --> 33:29.094
What I learned,

33:29.224 --> 33:30.747
is that nothing will grow here

33:30.878 --> 33:34.490
because the soil
has no phosphorus.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.885
That's right.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.497
Even if it did rain,
it'd be pointless.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.892
You're listening, folks,

33:45.023 --> 33:49.201
to a man so desperate, he
ignores the laws of nature

33:49.331 --> 33:52.160
in the expectation of a miracle.

33:54.423 --> 33:56.947
Is this who you want to follow?

34:01.604 --> 34:04.303
[gentle music]

34:13.399 --> 34:15.748
[horse neighing]

34:15.879 --> 34:18.317
[gentle music]

34:23.016 --> 34:26.411
[horse hooves clopping]

34:27.978 --> 34:31.243
Excuse me, Sir.

34:31.373 --> 34:34.246
Sir, I think I
might be interested

34:34.376 --> 34:36.509
in taking you up on that offer.

34:37.726 --> 34:38.772
All right.

34:39.989 --> 34:41.079
[Jack] I'm Jack.

34:43.690 --> 34:45.344
[Nicole] What are their names?

34:45.474 --> 34:47.085
Well you got Steve,

34:47.215 --> 34:49.043
his wife is Michelle.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.089
And little boy man is Dorian.

34:53.264 --> 34:55.005
They're very generous people.

34:58.487 --> 35:03.318
Hey, I asked for a sign
and they appeared, okay?

35:05.668 --> 35:06.800
Okay.

35:10.543 --> 35:12.414
Oh you shouldn't have.

35:12.545 --> 35:14.764
Not at all, it's the
least we could do.

35:16.244 --> 35:17.115
Well, thank you.

35:20.553 --> 35:22.816
Go and put this over
there, thank you.

35:24.731 --> 35:25.819
You see?

35:31.912 --> 35:36.177
[Bill gasping]

35:36.308 --> 35:40.486
Let's see if your medicine
loosens your tongue?

35:44.490 --> 35:47.145
[Bill screaming]

35:59.374 --> 36:02.203
How many men have
you killed Bill?

36:04.553 --> 36:06.294
Why do you do it?

36:07.600 --> 36:10.864
[suspenseful music]

36:12.518 --> 36:13.432
How many, Bill?

36:15.303 --> 36:16.435
How many men?

36:19.133 --> 36:20.439
How many, Bill?

36:22.484 --> 36:23.355
How many men?

36:23.485 --> 36:25.661
[suspenseful music]

36:25.792 --> 36:28.447
[woman crying]

36:32.277 --> 36:34.670
[Bronson] The things
we do for money.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.411
How many, Bill?

36:37.760 --> 36:39.240
How many men?

36:39.371 --> 36:42.243
[Bill screaming]

36:45.942 --> 36:46.813
Hundreds.

36:46.943 --> 36:49.859
[Bill screaming]

36:51.905 --> 36:53.254
Because I need to.

36:53.385 --> 36:56.170
[Bill screaming]

36:56.301 --> 36:59.086
Because I like to
watch them die.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.263
[suspenseful music]

37:03.786 --> 37:06.267
[Bill screaming]

37:08.617 --> 37:11.490
And darkness opened
the blind man's eyes.

37:14.623 --> 37:16.364
You see, we're all sinners.

37:19.628 --> 37:22.370
Condemned to make the same
mistakes, over and over again.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.592
But you and me,

37:28.420 --> 37:32.554
we're something more, right?

37:32.685 --> 37:36.254
Our nature, and our
duty, is to kill.

37:39.474 --> 37:40.736
Because this is hell

37:43.783 --> 37:45.350
and we're the demons.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.267
[suspenseful music]

37:49.397 --> 37:52.270
[sheep bleating]

[door knocking]

38:00.147 --> 38:02.976
[sheep bleating]

38:06.066 --> 38:07.067
Afternoon.

38:07.197 --> 38:08.851
[Kurt] Afternoon.

38:10.679 --> 38:12.333
My goats haven't wandered off

38:12.464 --> 38:15.031
and done some damage or
something, have they?

38:15.162 --> 38:17.469
We're looking for a man who
may have passed through here.

38:17.599 --> 38:20.123
About this height, and
probably riding one horse

38:20.254 --> 38:21.690
and leading another?

38:21.821 --> 38:23.126
-No, I can't say I've seen.
-May we come in?

38:23.257 --> 38:27.217
-Sure.
-[sheep bleating]

38:30.177 --> 38:32.614
Sorry about the mess.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.747
I don't get too many
visitors out here.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.969
Which is why I'm pretty
glad you called by.

38:42.058 --> 38:43.799
Especially since
you being lawmen.

38:45.845 --> 38:46.802
Drink?

38:46.933 --> 38:48.195
Why especially?

38:48.326 --> 38:50.806
Well, I've always
had a keen interest

38:50.937 --> 38:52.460
in men like yourselves.

38:53.940 --> 38:57.770
I know your kind of work
can be very dangerous.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.511
Yes, it can.

38:59.641 --> 39:00.555
And violent.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.166
You lived here long?

39:03.297 --> 39:04.777
Only all my life.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.998
This was my grandpa's house.

39:09.129 --> 39:11.436
He left it to my father.

39:11.566 --> 39:13.438
And my father left it to me.

39:20.967 --> 39:24.274
So, how are things in Greenvale?

39:24.405 --> 39:29.018
Are there more or less sons
of bitches there these days?

39:29.149 --> 39:30.498
Less with me in charge.

39:31.281 --> 39:34.154
[sheep bleating]

39:44.120 --> 39:46.122
And how many men
have you killed?

39:46.253 --> 39:49.387
[suspenseful music]

39:54.217 --> 39:58.439
You'd think that,
you let this rot in a barrel?

40:01.660 --> 40:04.793
Oh, well, I can offer
you something else.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.534
No...

40:09.015 --> 40:10.016
What's that smell?

40:10.146 --> 40:11.017
[Butler laughing]

40:11.147 --> 40:12.410
Yeah,

40:12.540 --> 40:14.499
that's one of my goats.

40:14.629 --> 40:17.937
I'm sorry, she's sick, I have
to keep her inside the house.

40:18.067 --> 40:20.505
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:20.635 --> 40:23.159
I hope she has a
speedy recovery.

40:23.290 --> 40:26.162
Thank you, thank you.

40:26.293 --> 40:27.163
[suspenseful music]

40:27.294 --> 40:28.904
Sure you didn't see anybody?

40:29.035 --> 40:30.340
Nope.

40:32.734 --> 40:34.693
Now you wouldn't lie
to us, would you?

40:37.304 --> 40:39.349
I'm not only good
at killing people,

40:40.829 --> 40:42.701
I'm pretty good at
reading 'em too.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.095
[suspenseful music]

40:46.226 --> 40:48.576
Well, I'm telling
the truth, Sheriff.

40:54.103 --> 40:55.365
No one comes by.

40:58.107 --> 40:59.631
All right, then.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.154
[suspenseful music]

41:01.284 --> 41:03.765
I don't see any reason
to stay any longer.

41:03.896 --> 41:06.464
Thank you for your hospitality.

41:07.203 --> 41:08.291
You're welcome.

41:08.422 --> 41:11.077

41:43.631 --> 41:45.067
Son of bitch.

41:46.373 --> 41:47.330
Kurt.

41:47.461 --> 41:50.508
[suspenseful music]

41:58.385 --> 42:01.519
[Butler] Can you feel it, Bill?

42:02.694 --> 42:03.999
A relief?

42:07.612 --> 42:09.135
A passing on?

42:09.265 --> 42:11.224
[suspenseful music]

42:11.354 --> 42:13.531
Nothing will save you now.

42:15.271 --> 42:17.360
[insects chirping]

42:17.491 --> 42:20.668
[suspenseful music]

42:20.799 --> 42:24.542
Their souls no longer
belong to you, my friend.

42:27.153 --> 42:29.155
Becoming part of my family.

42:29.285 --> 42:32.462
[suspenseful music]

42:49.871 --> 42:50.829
Hey.

42:57.313 --> 42:58.793
Can we talk?

43:03.537 --> 43:04.843
Well?

43:08.020 --> 43:09.282
Why did you have to
belittle me like that?

43:09.412 --> 43:11.632
You belittle yourself by
being so childishness.

43:14.548 --> 43:16.202
It hurts.

43:16.332 --> 43:19.292
[horse neighing]

43:21.294 --> 43:24.471
But women can't survive in
this world without power.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.560
That's what you wanted
when you first came here

43:26.691 --> 43:28.301
and that's what I've delivered.

43:29.563 --> 43:31.391
But there is a price to pay.

43:33.959 --> 43:36.309
And now you're starting
to see what it is.

43:39.355 --> 43:41.096
I love you, Symone.

43:42.445 --> 43:43.882
And if you change your mind

43:44.012 --> 43:48.277
and want to be a deputy's
wife, a common woman,

43:48.408 --> 43:49.888
I wouldn't stop you.

43:50.018 --> 43:51.672
-I know what I want.
-I'm not sure you do.

43:53.935 --> 43:57.330
You need to have a long,
hard think about it.

43:57.460 --> 44:00.115
[gentle music]

44:17.959 --> 44:19.961

Symone.

44:21.833 --> 44:23.312
[Symone] Nathan.

44:31.886 --> 44:33.235
Let me in.

44:37.457 --> 44:38.980
[horse neighing]

44:39.111 --> 44:42.157
At least tell me
you'll marry me.

44:49.774 --> 44:52.515
We thank you, Lord,

44:52.646 --> 44:56.606
for this food, this shelter,

44:58.521 --> 44:59.697
for our new friends

45:01.307 --> 45:04.832
and we thank you for the
rain which is promised us

45:06.486 --> 45:08.967
and which will fall
heavy on this ground.

45:12.144 --> 45:13.319
Amen.

45:13.449 --> 45:15.147
[All] Amen.

45:15.277 --> 45:17.105
Amen.

There he is.

The Great Red Bill.

The Great Red Bill,
with his ass hung up.

47:11.959 --> 47:15.310
[Bill screaming]

47:15.441 --> 47:18.009
Hey, Kurt, how much was that
box, the Frenchman had,

47:18.139 --> 47:19.619
makes the pictures?

47:19.749 --> 47:21.055
-$200.
-Hah.

47:25.930 --> 47:27.279
This makes quite the picture.

47:29.672 --> 47:30.499
You make me sick.

47:35.243 --> 47:37.115
Sheriff.

47:37.245 --> 47:40.466
Sheriff.
Sheriff!

47:40.596 --> 47:43.773
[suspenseful music]

48:16.284 --> 48:18.808
Maybe tomorrow.

48:18.939 --> 48:20.767
Maybe she doesn't like me.

48:20.898 --> 48:23.074
What are you saying?

48:23.204 --> 48:24.597
She really likes you.

48:24.727 --> 48:27.078
You're the best little
girl in the world.

48:27.208 --> 48:30.951
[Mary] So she doesn't like you?

48:31.082 --> 48:33.301
You didn't yell at her, did you?

48:33.432 --> 48:35.564
No.

48:35.695 --> 48:37.392
No, no, she likes me too.

48:37.523 --> 48:41.005
And by tomorrow evening
we'll all be here together.

48:41.135 --> 48:43.616
We will stay here all together.

48:45.313 --> 48:47.141
Forever.

48:47.272 --> 48:49.622
You promise me?

48:49.752 --> 48:50.971
I promise, honey.

-I promise.
-[suspenseful music]

48:56.455 --> 48:58.196
