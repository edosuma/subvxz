WEBVTT

00:02.877 --> 00:04.795
Who the winny-binny boy?

00:04.963 --> 00:08.799
Oh,
you the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!

00:08.967 --> 00:10.050
Yes.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.595
Don't cry.

00:13.805 --> 00:17.307
Don't cry, huh?

00:17.475 --> 00:19.727
Why is he still crying?

00:19.936 --> 00:22.062
Let me hold him for a sec.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.189
Here we go. Huh?

00:24.524 --> 00:25.983
Huh. There we are.

00:27.694 --> 00:28.902
Maybe it's me.

00:29.070 --> 00:33.115
Don't be silly. Ben loves you.
He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.

00:33.283 --> 00:36.285
You know, I once dated
a Miss Cranky Pants.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.289
Lovely girl. Kind of moody.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.416
There we go, all better.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.960
There's my little boy. Eh.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.719
Can I, uh, see something?

01:07.525 --> 01:10.069
- Cool!
- He hates me.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.696
- My nephew hates me!
- Come on, don't do this.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.616
What if my own baby hates me, huh?
What do I do then?

01:15.784 --> 01:17.326
Monica, stop! This is nuts.

01:17.494 --> 01:21.205
Do you know how long it'll be
before you have to deal with this?

01:22.499 --> 01:23.999
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.463
Joey, she does not look fat.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.762
Here you go.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.222
Oh, hey, Mon.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.519
Goo, goo, goo!

02:28.731 --> 02:31.567
That is so funny!
Let me see that a sec. Ha-ha-ha.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.068
Whoa.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.242
You okay?

02:40.410 --> 02:41.577
I don't know.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.289
What's in this pie?

02:45.498 --> 02:49.376
I don't know. Um, butter and eggs
and flour and lime and kiwi...

02:49.544 --> 02:51.587
Kiwi? Kiwi?!

02:52.255 --> 02:53.922
You said it was a key lime pie.

02:54.090 --> 02:58.051
No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime.
That's what makes it so special.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.137
That's what's gonna kill me.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.599
Ahem. I'm allergic to kiwi.

03:03.766 --> 03:06.894
No, you're not. You're allergic
to lobster and peanuts and...

03:09.898 --> 03:13.275
- Oh, my God!
- Uh. It's definitely getting worse.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.736
All right. Is your tongue swelling up?

03:15.904 --> 03:19.072
Either that
or my mouth is getting smaller!

03:19.240 --> 03:21.825
- Get your coat. We'll to the hospital.
- Uh.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.286
- Will he be okay?
- He's gotta get a shot.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.873
Uh, you know, actually,
it's getting better. It is.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.459
Let's not go. Anyone up for Scrabble?

03:31.502 --> 03:33.295
Jacket, now!

03:33.713 --> 03:37.090
What about Ben?
We can't bring a baby to the hospital.

03:37.258 --> 03:38.592
We'll watch him.

03:38.801 --> 03:41.470
Uh. Ha, I don't think so.

03:42.555 --> 03:46.308
What? I have seven Catholic sisters.
I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.311
Come on, we want to do it.
Don't we?

03:49.520 --> 03:51.605
I was gonna play basketball...

03:51.814 --> 03:53.732
...but I guess that's out the window.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.070
If you take him out
for a walk, remember to bring his hat.

03:58.279 --> 04:01.156
There's milk in the refrigerator
and diapers in the bag.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.951
Hat, milk... Got it!

04:04.118 --> 04:05.661
- Let's go.
- Okay.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.836
Consider it done!

04:15.004 --> 04:16.213
You understood?

04:16.380 --> 04:19.173
My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

04:21.135 --> 04:23.595
Is he the one
with the beautiful wife?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.352
Hey, Rach.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.021
You want to hear the song
I'm singing this afternoon?

04:33.189 --> 04:36.066
- I wrote it this morning in the shower.
- Okay.

04:37.986 --> 04:42.572
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song

04:43.074 --> 04:46.868
Stop me if you've heard it

04:48.329 --> 04:52.916
My skin is soapy and my hair is wet

04:53.126 --> 04:57.504
And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget

05:01.259 --> 05:05.387
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart,
could I see you for a minute?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.684
- What's up?
- Uh...

05:10.852 --> 05:12.728
FYl:

05:12.895 --> 05:16.982
I've decided to pay a professional
musician to play here on Sundays.

05:17.150 --> 05:21.403
Her name is Stephanie something.
Uh, she's supposed to be very good.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.280
But what about Phoebe?

05:23.448 --> 05:27.367
Rachel, uh,
it's not that your friend is bad.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.454
It's that she's so bad...

05:31.914 --> 05:36.626
...she makes me want to put my finger
through my eye into my brain...

05:36.794 --> 05:38.587
...and swirl it around.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.091
Okay, so you're not a fan.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.762
But, I mean, come on.
You cannot do this to her.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.388
Uh.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.515
Oh, no, no, no.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.434
- I have to do this to her?
- Mm-hm.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.770
Lather, rinse, repeat

05:54.937 --> 06:00.817
And lather, rinse, repeat

06:00.985 --> 06:02.778
As needed

06:09.327 --> 06:11.078
We didn't bring enough stuff.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.747
Did you forget to pack
the baby's anvil?

06:13.956 --> 06:15.999
I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.252
It's a known fact
that women love babies, all right?

06:19.420 --> 06:22.923
Women love guys who love babies.
It's the sensitive thing.

06:23.758 --> 06:27.636
Aim him at that pack of babes.
Maybe one of them will break away.

06:28.346 --> 06:31.765
Wait, forget them.
We got one. Hard left.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.725
- Give me the baby.
- No, I got him.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.185
Come on, seriously.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.229
Oh, seriously, you want him?

06:37.814 --> 06:39.314
Hello.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.024
Hello.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.652
Who is this little cutie-pie?

06:43.820 --> 06:46.655
Well, don't think me immodest, but...

06:46.823 --> 06:48.281
...me.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.784
Want to smell him?

06:50.952 --> 06:53.120
I assume we're talking
about the baby?

06:54.580 --> 06:55.664
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.

06:55.832 --> 06:59.126
He's got that great baby smell.
Get a whiff of his head.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.213
My uterus just skipped a beat.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.674
What'd I tell you?

07:05.842 --> 07:07.384
It's great you're doing this.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.928
Well, we are great guys.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.056
My brother and his boyfriend
have been trying to adopt.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.016
What agency did you two go through?

07:20.231 --> 07:21.982
But this is my gig.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.483
This is where I play.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.361
My name is written out there in chalk.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.156
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.910
Honey, I'm sorry.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.371
And he's going to
be paying this woman?

07:36.539 --> 07:39.458
Why doesn't he just give her
a throne and a crown?

07:39.625 --> 07:44.754
And, like, you know, a gold stick
with a ball on top?

07:45.381 --> 07:49.134
Terry is a jerk! That's why
we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"

07:49.302 --> 07:52.053
That's where that came from.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.347
Yeah, okay.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.058
You probably did everything you could.

07:58.519 --> 08:02.105
You know what? Let me just
see what else I can do.

08:03.649 --> 08:04.900
All right, look, look.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.069
Just let her go on after
Stephanie whatever her name is.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.697
You won't be here.
You don't pay her.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.574
I don't know.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.701
I'll clean the cappuccino machine!

08:14.869 --> 08:17.245
You don't clean
the cappuccino machine?

08:18.664 --> 08:21.541
Of course I clean it.

08:21.709 --> 08:26.087
I mean, I will clean it.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.549
All right, fine, fine, fine!

08:31.636 --> 08:33.260
Oh.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.889
- Done.
- Really?

08:36.057 --> 08:37.640
Who's working for you, babe?

08:37.808 --> 08:41.520
- Oh, my God! This is so exciting!
- I know.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.063
How much am I gonna get?

08:43.231 --> 08:44.606
What?

08:44.774 --> 08:47.317
He's paying the people
who were playing.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.027
Oh, no, no, no.

08:49.195 --> 08:53.281
I meant, he's paying that other woman
because she's a professional.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.660
I'm not gonna be the only one
who's not getting paid.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.161
But, Pheebs...

08:58.329 --> 08:59.621
Uh-uh, I'm sorry, no!

08:59.789 --> 09:04.417
No, I'm not some sloppy second,
you know, charity band.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.003
There are thousands of places
in this city...

09:07.171 --> 09:10.090
...where people would pay
to hear me play.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.175
When I play, I play for me

09:12.343 --> 09:14.469
I don't need your charity

09:14.637 --> 09:15.929
Thank you!

09:24.230 --> 09:27.357
I'm not getting a
shot. Maybe they can take the needle...

09:27.525 --> 09:30.860
...and squirt it into my mouth.
Like a squirt gun.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.447
Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.

09:34.615 --> 09:38.618
I see someone's having
a little allergic reaction.

09:38.786 --> 09:41.538
Doctor, can I see you
for just a moment?

09:43.040 --> 09:47.168
My brother has
a slight phobia about needles.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.337
Did you tell him
about my squirt gun idea?

09:51.757 --> 09:54.217
My brother, the Ph.D.,
would like to know...

09:54.385 --> 09:56.595
...if there's any way
to treat this orally?

09:56.762 --> 09:57.846
No.

09:58.014 --> 10:02.142
Under these circumstances, it has to be
an injection, and it has to be now.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.603
So?

10:04.770 --> 10:06.438
Oh.

10:06.647 --> 10:10.817
Go and have a seat. Um, the doctor
says it's got to be a needle.

10:10.985 --> 10:15.822
You're just going to have to be brave.
Can you do that for me?

10:17.116 --> 10:18.450
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.453
Oh, boy! You are doing so good.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.165
- You want to squeeze my hand?
- Yes.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.376
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.879
Honey, really.
Don't squeeze it so hard!

10:31.339 --> 10:33.173
Let go of my hand!

10:36.719 --> 10:39.054
Good plan. Next time
we want to pick up women...

10:39.221 --> 10:42.140
...we should go to
the park and make out.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.017
Taxi! Taxi!

10:46.687 --> 10:49.064
Look at that talent.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.901
Just practicing. You're good.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.819
Carry on.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.030
Wait, wait, wait!

10:57.198 --> 11:00.533
Hey, you. He's just adorable.

11:00.701 --> 11:05.038
Can you tell him that?
Because he thinks he looks too pink.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.125
- What are you guys out doing today?
- We're not out.

11:09.293 --> 11:11.252
No, no. No.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.297
We're two heterosexual guys
hanging with the son...

11:14.465 --> 11:18.176
...of our other heterosexual friend,
doing the usual straight-guy stuff.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.263
- You done?
- Yeah.

11:22.431 --> 11:23.848
Oh, there's our stop.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.227
Get out of here!
This is our stop.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.479
- You guys live around here too?
- Yeah, sure.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.399
We live in the building
by the, uh, sidewalk.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.860
You know it?

11:36.737 --> 11:41.533
Ha, ha. Since we're neighbors, what do
you say we, uh, get together for a drink?

11:46.455 --> 11:48.707
So, uh, you want to go to Markel's?

11:49.375 --> 11:51.126
Oh, sure, they love us over there.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.044
Where's your baby?

11:58.718 --> 12:01.594
Ben! Ben!

12:04.348 --> 12:06.433
Ben! Ben!

12:06.767 --> 12:10.562
That's good. Maybe he'll
hear you and pull the cord!

12:10.730 --> 12:11.896
Stop the bus! Hey!

12:12.565 --> 12:15.525
- Hey, there's a baby!
- Wait, wait, wait!

12:20.990 --> 12:23.408
Are you sure he didn't break it?
It hurts.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.994
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

12:26.162 --> 12:30.749
And right here is
the puncture wound from your ring.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.211
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.504
Sorry.

12:36.839 --> 12:40.467
Hmm, sorry! I got my S's back!
Ha, ha.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.803
Which we can celebrate later.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.514
Celebrate. Celebrate...

12:47.892 --> 12:49.726
He was a double, double

12:49.894 --> 12:52.562
Double-jointed boy

12:54.440 --> 12:55.565
Hey.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.610
So, um, are you the
professional guitar player?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.695
Yeah, I'm Stephanie.

13:00.863 --> 13:05.200
Oh, right. My name was on there,
but now it just says carrot cake.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.660
Okay.

13:07.828 --> 13:10.288
So, um,
how many chords do you know?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.625
- All of them.
- So you know D?

13:14.502 --> 13:16.920
- Yeah.
- Do you know A-minor?

13:18.380 --> 13:19.756
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.592
Do you know how to go
from D to A-minor?

13:24.136 --> 13:26.596
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.474
Um, so does your guitar have a strap?

13:31.393 --> 13:32.644
- No.
- Oh.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.978
Mine does.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.984
Stephanie knows all the chords

13:42.446 --> 13:44.197
Come on! Pick up, pick up!

13:44.365 --> 13:45.740
Hello. Ahem.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.826
Transit Authority? Yes, hello.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.161
I'm doing research for a book.

13:50.329 --> 13:54.165
I was wondering what somebody might
do if they left a baby on a city bus.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.878
Yes, I realize that would be
a stupid character.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.798
Here's the deal:
We lost a car seat on a bus.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.592
It's white plastic and
it fits onto a stroller.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.220
Oh, and there was a baby in it.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.139
He wants to talk to you.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.520
Everybody, let's give a warm
Central Perk welcome to...

14:15.688 --> 14:18.523
Terry's a jerk and he won't let me work

14:18.691 --> 14:20.650
And I hate Central Perk

14:25.197 --> 14:27.448
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer!

14:27.616 --> 14:29.325
Whoo!

14:32.830 --> 14:37.041
I'd like to start with a song I wrote
for the first man I ever loved.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.880
Zachary...

14:42.047 --> 14:45.258
Are all invited to bite me

14:54.351 --> 14:58.062
We're the guys that called
about the baby! Is he here?!

14:58.564 --> 15:00.189
- He's here.
- Aah!

15:02.985 --> 15:04.652
I assume one of you is the father.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.029
- That's me.
- I'm him.

15:08.699 --> 15:12.911
Actually, uh, ahem,
we're both the father.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.297
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.139
Please tell me you know
which one is our baby.

15:34.808 --> 15:38.019
That one has ducks on his T-shirt
and this one has clowns.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.271
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.940
Or clowns.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.400
Oh, wait.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.820
That one's Ben! Remember he had
that cute little mole by his mouth!

15:47.988 --> 15:49.072
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:49.239 --> 15:51.282
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

15:52.368 --> 15:53.993
Okay, the mole came off.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.747
- What are we gonna do?
- Uh.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.833
We'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.127
- Flip for the baby?
- You got a better idea?

16:03.295 --> 16:05.046
All right, call it in the air.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.840
Heads.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.384
- Heads, it is.
- Yes.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.222
We have to assign heads
to something!

16:15.933 --> 16:17.684
Right! Okay.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.352
Okay, uh...

16:20.229 --> 16:23.815
Ducks is heads
because ducks have heads.

16:28.570 --> 16:31.280
What kind of scary-ass clowns
came to your birthday?

16:38.664 --> 16:43.626
Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

16:43.794 --> 16:48.631
Just touch my cheek
Before you leave me, baby

16:48.799 --> 16:53.219
Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

16:53.387 --> 16:57.640
Then slowly turn away

16:58.183 --> 17:01.686
I won't beg you to stay

17:02.312 --> 17:04.521
With me

17:12.156 --> 17:14.699
- Hey
- Oh, hi.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.660
Here. I thought you might be cold.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.537
Thank you.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.330
Oh.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.546
Oh, look at you!
You did pretty well.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.841
$8.27.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.510
But not really, because
I put in the first two.

17:36.180 --> 17:40.433
Just to get the ball rolling
and to make myself feel better.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.809
Do you?

17:41.977 --> 17:43.436
No.

17:43.604 --> 17:47.899
You know, this whole playing
for money thing is so not good for me.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.652
I don't know, when I
sang "Su-su-suicide"...

17:52.988 --> 17:56.574
...I got, like, $1.75.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.910
But then "Smelly Cat"? Oh.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.956
I got 25 cents and a condom.

18:05.459 --> 18:09.170
So, you know, now I just feel
really bad for "Smelly Cat."

18:10.422 --> 18:11.547
Well, you know.

18:11.757 --> 18:15.885
Honey, I don't think
everybody gets "Smelly Cat."

18:16.095 --> 18:22.183
I mean, if all you've ever actually
had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

18:23.102 --> 18:25.478
But it's not even that, you know?

18:25.687 --> 18:28.523
I used to do my songs
because it made me happy.

18:28.690 --> 18:32.693
Now it's just all
about the money, you know?

18:35.322 --> 18:37.490
Well, people missed you in there.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.910
In fact, there was actually
a request for "Smelly Cat."

18:41.078 --> 18:42.787
Really? From who?

18:43.330 --> 18:44.664
Well, me.

18:46.291 --> 18:50.461
And I know it's not your big
money song, but it's my favorite.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.549
Hi.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.176
Uh. Did I accidentally drop
a condom in your case?

19:01.890 --> 19:03.432
It's kind of an emergency.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.059
Yeah.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.769
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.230
Hey, Christine! I got it!

19:15.571 --> 19:18.364
I want to thank you
for being there for me.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.950
And I'm sorry
I almost broke your hand. Ha, ha.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.245
That's okay.
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.705
Mm.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.167
Remember the time I jammed
that pencil into your hand?

19:29.334 --> 19:33.129
Remember it? What do
you think this is, a freckle?

19:33.297 --> 19:34.589
Oh.

19:34.756 --> 19:38.593
What about the time I hit you
in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?

19:38.760 --> 19:41.179
Remember when I stuck
that broom in your spokes...

19:41.346 --> 19:43.890
...and you hit your head on the curb?

19:44.057 --> 19:45.308
No.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.143
But I remember
people telling me about it.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.728
Oh.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.731
I hope Ben has a little sister.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.316
Yeah.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.526
And I hope she can kick his ass.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.863
I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.825
How about the time I cut
the legs off your Malibu Ken?

20:03.493 --> 20:04.911
That was you?

20:06.121 --> 20:07.205
Uh.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.499
They were infected.
He wouldn't have made it.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.420
Aw.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.005
My little nephew.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.924
Come here, little one!

20:18.592 --> 20:22.386
Oh. There's my little baby, Ben!

20:22.554 --> 20:25.014
Hey, my little boy. Oh.

20:26.516 --> 20:29.018
Hey, he's not crying!

20:32.731 --> 20:34.732
Hey, he's not crying!

20:38.111 --> 20:39.862
Yes.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.282
There's still pie! Ha-ha-ha.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.535
I'm here. I'm here.

20:46.703 --> 20:49.121
Uh. How's my little boy, huh?

20:49.623 --> 20:53.751
You want Daddy to change
your diaper? I know, I know.

20:54.628 --> 20:58.047
Did you have fun with, uh, Uncle Joey
and Uncle Chandler today?

20:58.215 --> 20:59.298
Oh, yeah.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.842
- He rode the bus today.
- Ooh.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.346
Well.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.516
Big boy riding the bus...

21:09.226 --> 21:11.018
Hey, I have a question.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.732
How come it says,
"Property of Human Services"?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.861
You...

21:21.655 --> 21:23.239
You are gonna love this.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.492
Can you hold Ben for a sec?

21:27.327 --> 21:28.411
Come here. Come here.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.664
Stay back! I've got kiwi!
Run, Joey, run!

21:37.921 --> 21:40.965
Smelly cat, smelly cat

21:41.133 --> 21:43.551
What are they feeding you?

21:44.094 --> 21:45.553
No, no. I'm sorry, it's, ahem:

21:45.721 --> 21:48.723
Smelly cat, smelly cat

21:53.228 --> 21:56.814
Smelly cat, smelly cat

21:57.274 --> 21:58.607
- Better!
- Yeah?

21:58.775 --> 21:59.859
Much better. Good.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.653
Don't feel bad,
because it's a hard song.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.113
Yeah.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.533
- You want to try it again?
- From the top?

22:07.701 --> 22:09.785
There is no "top," all right?

22:09.953 --> 22:12.872
That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat."

22:14.916 --> 22:17.209
Um. Ahem.
Why don't you just follow me?

22:17.461 --> 22:18.919
- Okay.
Mm-hm.

22:19.129 --> 22:22.715
Smelly cat, smelly cat

22:22.883 --> 22:25.801
What are they feeding you?

22:26.553 --> 22:29.513
Smelly cat, smelly cat

22:29.681 --> 22:32.808
It's not your fault

22:33.560 --> 22:36.103
That's too much. Sorry.
