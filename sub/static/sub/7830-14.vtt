You're missing
"The Itchy & Scratchy show."

01:18.828 --> 01:19.788
Don't you
like it anymore?

01:19.871 --> 01:21.873
Sure. We love it.

01:21.956 --> 01:24.709
But how can we watch TV
when it's so beautiful out?

01:24.793 --> 01:26.169
Well, yeah, Mom.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.921
I mean, we love you
and Dad, too,

01:28.004 --> 01:29.297
but God knows, we don't
need to see you every day.

An occasional hug
is all I ask.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.675
Mmm...

01:32.759 --> 01:34.969
Mom! You can hug me
when I'm asleep.

Hey, Krusty,
you look great.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.895
You get your
teeth bleached?

01:43.978 --> 01:45.897
Yeah, it's a new kind
of polymer treatment...

01:45.980 --> 01:47.524
Hey, shut up!

01:47.607 --> 01:49.442
You're here 'cause your
Itchy & Scratchy cartoons

01:49.526 --> 01:51.027
are stinking up
my ratings.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.113
Look at this breakdown
of yesterday's show.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.239
Uh... Uh...

01:54.322 --> 01:55.532
Eeyah... Kaboom.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.908
What happened here?

01:56.991 --> 01:58.576
Lightning hit
the transmitter?

01:58.660 --> 02:00.078
See, that's what I thought
at first...

02:00.161 --> 02:01.663
Hey, shut up!

02:01.746 --> 02:05.041
That crater is where your
lousy cartoon crash-landed!

02:05.125 --> 02:06.626
It's ratings poison!

02:06.709 --> 02:09.504
But Itchy & Scratchy
is critically acclaimed.

02:09.587 --> 02:10.505
Acclaimed?

02:10.588 --> 02:12.048
(spits)

02:12.132 --> 02:14.676
I ought to replace it right now
with a Chinese cartoon

02:14.759 --> 02:17.637
where the robots
turn into... Blingwads!

02:17.720 --> 02:21.099
But I'm a lazy,
lazy man, Roger.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.101
So I'll give you
one more chance.

02:23.184 --> 02:24.936
Now, get out!

02:25.019 --> 02:26.896
Don't come back till you've
fixed Itchy & Scratchy.

you can go in now.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.113
Krusty, I've come
to solicit donations

02:35.196 --> 02:36.489
for the rock 'n roll museum,

02:36.573 --> 02:38.783

02:42.203 --> 02:43.830
I need to purchase
a brassiere.

Oh, can't we just
wander around

02:48.126 --> 02:49.544
and meet you back here
later?

02:49.627 --> 02:52.046
Mmm...
Okay, just be careful.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.344
Would you kids
like to come with me?

02:58.428 --> 03:00.555
-Okay, I guess so.
-Sounds good to me. Let's go.

03:00.638 --> 03:04.184
All right, thanks for participating
in our focus group, kids.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.977
Today, we're going
to show you some

03:06.060 --> 03:07.896
Itchy & Scratchy
cartoons.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.522
(all cheering)

03:09.606 --> 03:10.690
Cool!

03:10.773 --> 03:11.858
We want you to tell us
what you think

03:11.941 --> 03:13.776
and be honest because

03:13.860 --> 03:15.987
no one from the show
is here spying on you.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.822
(muffled sneeze)

03:17.906 --> 03:19.365
Why is that
mirror sneezing?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.993
Uh, look, it's just
an old, creaky mirror.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.870
Sometimes it sounds
a little like it's

03:23.953 --> 03:25.997
sneezing or coughing
or talking softly.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.498
Hmm...

03:29.083 --> 03:31.794
Now you each have a knob
in front of you.

03:31.878 --> 03:35.006
When you like what you see,
turn the knob to the right.

03:35.089 --> 03:38.092
When you don't like
what you see, turn it left.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.595
My knob tastes funny.

real-life problems

04:17.715 --> 04:19.259
like the ones
you face every day?

04:19.342 --> 04:21.552
-I would!
-Great idea! Yeah, that's it!

04:21.636 --> 04:24.389
And who would like to see them
do just the opposite,

04:24.472 --> 04:26.224
getting into
far-out situations

04:26.307 --> 04:28.601

and magic powers?

04:28.685 --> 04:29.852
-Oh, cool!
-Me!

04:29.936 --> 04:31.938
-Cool!
-Yeah, that's I want!

04:32.021 --> 04:35.650
So, you want a realistic,
down-to-earth show...

04:35.733 --> 04:37.151
that's completely
off the wall

04:37.235 --> 04:39.028
and swarming
with magic robots.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.655
-That's right.
-Yeah, good.

04:40.738 --> 04:43.408

win things by watching.

You kids don't know
what you want!

That's why you're still kids--
'cause you're stupid!

04:50.039 --> 04:52.750
Just tell me what's wrong
with the freakin' show!

04:58.339 --> 05:00.174
Um, excuse me, sir.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.427
The thing is, there's not
really anything wrong

05:02.510 --> 05:04.304
with "The Itchy
and Scratchy Show."

05:04.387 --> 05:05.305
It's as good as ever.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.056
But after so many years,

05:07.140 --> 05:10.935
the characters just can't have
the same impact they once had.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.770
That's it.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.689
That's it,
little girl!

05:14.772 --> 05:16.065
You've saved
"Itchy & Scratchy"!

05:16.149 --> 05:17.608
Please sign these papers

05:17.692 --> 05:19.736
indicating you did not
save "Itchy & Scratchy."

05:19.819 --> 05:21.946
I have figured out

05:22.030 --> 05:23.531
how to rejuvenate the show.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.366
It is so simple

05:25.450 --> 05:27.660
you egghead writers
would've never thought of it.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.787
What we need is...

05:29.871 --> 05:31.331
a new character!

05:31.414 --> 05:33.624
One that today's kids
can relate to!

05:35.293 --> 05:37.337
Are you absolutely sure
that's wise, sir?

05:37.420 --> 05:39.714
I don't want to sound
pretentious here, but...

05:39.797 --> 05:42.300
Itchy & Scratchy
comprise a dramaturgical dyad.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.010
Hey, this ain't art;
it's business!

05:44.093 --> 05:45.303
What do you got in mind?

05:45.386 --> 05:47.263
Sexy broad?
Gangster octopus?

05:47.347 --> 05:48.514
No... No.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.892
The animal chain
of command goes

05:50.975 --> 05:54.103
mouse, cat, dog.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.938
D-O-G.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.524
Uh, a dog?
Isn't that a tad predictable?

05:58.608 --> 06:00.151
In your dreams.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.528
We're talking
the original dog from hell.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.488
You mean Cerberus?

06:05.114 --> 06:07.825
We at the network
want a dog with attitude.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.577
He's edgy.
He's in your face.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.913
You've heard the expression
"Let's get busy"?

06:11.996 --> 06:15.291
Well, this is a dog
who gets biz-zay...

06:15.375 --> 06:17.251
consistently and thoroughly.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.294
So, he's proactive, huh?

06:18.378 --> 06:20.004
Oh, God, yes.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.715
We're talking about
a totally outrageous paradigm.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.052
Excuse me, but "proactive"
and "paradigm"--

06:26.135 --> 06:27.512
Aren't these just buzzwords

06:27.595 --> 06:29.514
that dumb people use
to sound important?

06:29.597 --> 06:32.517
Not that I'm accusing you
of anything like that.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.851
I'm fired, aren't I?

06:33.935 --> 06:34.894
Oh, yes.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.229
The rest of you writers

06:36.312 --> 06:38.147
start thinking up a name
for this funky dog.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.566
I don't know, something along
the lines of, say... "Poochie"

06:40.650 --> 06:42.777
only more proactive.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.320
Yeah!

06:46.948 --> 06:49.158
-(door slams)
-So, "Poochie" okay with everybody?

06:49.242 --> 06:52.120
-Yeah.
-Yeah. You know, it's good.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.748
No, no, no.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.251
He was supposed
to have attitude.

06:58.334 --> 07:01.379
Um, wh-what do
you mean, exactly?

07:01.462 --> 07:04.215
Oh, you know,
attitude, attitude!

07:04.298 --> 07:06.259
Uh... Sunglasses!

07:06.342 --> 07:08.761
Can we put him in more
of a hip-hop context?

07:08.845 --> 07:11.347
Forget context.
He's got to be a surfer.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.057
Give me a nice shmear
of surfer.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.561
I feel we should
rasta-fy him by 10% or so.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.234
Mm.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.361
I think he needs
a little more attitude.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.406
-Oh, yeah, bingo.
-Yeah!

07:28.489 --> 07:30.741
-There it is, right there. That's it.
-I love it.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.412
Hey, Lis, look,

07:34.495 --> 07:36.706
they're adding a new character
to "Itchy & Scratchy"!

07:36.789 --> 07:38.332
Poochie the Dog?

07:38.416 --> 07:40.460
Adding a new character
is often a desperate attempt

07:40.543 --> 07:42.044
to boost low ratings.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.630
Yo, yo! How's it hanging,
everybody?

07:44.714 --> 07:46.090
Morning, Roy.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.508
Yeah, hi, Roy.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.968
Hey! They're having
open casting

07:49.051 --> 07:50.470
for the voice of Poochie.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.804
You should try out, Dad.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.390
-You have a funny voice.
-I do not!

07:54.474 --> 07:56.642
Haven't you ever listened to
yourself on a tape recorder?

07:56.726 --> 07:58.436
I prefer to listen
to Cheap Trick.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.480
Well, here,
say something.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.899
Hey... This is
Homer Simpson saying

08:02.982 --> 08:06.861
howdy to all the girls
out there in radio-land.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.488

08:08.571 --> 08:11.157
<i>Hey, this is</i>
<i>Homer Simpson saying...</i>

08:11.240 --> 08:13.534
Ah! I don't sound
like that, do I?

08:13.618 --> 08:17.622
Oh... I don't like having
such a hilarious voice.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.625
That hilarious voice could be
your ticket to stardom.

08:26.088 --> 08:29.175
Whoa, a talking dog!

08:29.258 --> 08:30.885

08:30.968 --> 08:33.846
What were you guys smoking
when you came up with that?

08:33.930 --> 08:36.057
We were eating
rotisserie chicken.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.975
Can you just
read the line, please?

08:38.059 --> 08:39.519
"Ruff, ruff!

08:39.602 --> 08:42.480
I am Poochie,
the Rockin' Dog!"

08:42.563 --> 08:43.940
You're perfect!

08:44.023 --> 08:45.942
In fact,
you're better than perfect!

08:46.025 --> 08:48.736
Next to you,
perfection is crap.

08:48.819 --> 08:52.323
"Ruff, ruff! I'm Poochie,
the Rockin' Dog!"

08:52.406 --> 08:54.408
Hi. I'm Troy McClure.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.327
You may remember me
from such cartoons

08:56.410 --> 08:57.787
as "Christmas Ape"

08:57.870 --> 09:00.581
And "Christmas Ape
Goes to Summer Camp."

09:00.665 --> 09:02.792
You're even better
than this guy!

09:02.875 --> 09:04.335
Take a hike, you bum.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.586
(grumbles)

09:05.670 --> 09:08.047
(clears throat)
"Ruff, ruff!

09:08.130 --> 09:10.091
I'm Poochie,
the Rockin' Dog!"

09:10.174 --> 09:14.011
Now, that's just bad. You got no attitude,
you're barely outrageous

09:14.095 --> 09:16.055
and I don't know what you're in,
but it's not my face.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.515
Next.

09:17.598 --> 09:21.519
Oh, no attitude, eh?
Not in your face, huh?

09:21.602 --> 09:24.146
Well, you can cram it
with walnuts, ugly!

09:24.230 --> 09:25.898
That's it,
that's the Poochie attitude!

09:25.982 --> 09:27.525
Do that again.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.027
Huh? I can't.
I don't remember what I did.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.113
Then you don't get the job.
Next!

09:32.196 --> 09:34.699
Oh, I don't
get the job, do I?

09:34.782 --> 09:36.993
Well, boo-hoo...

09:37.076 --> 09:40.204
I don't get to be
a cartoon dog.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.540
That's it!
You've got the job!

09:42.623 --> 09:45.918
Oh, now
I got the job, huh?

09:46.002 --> 09:46.877
Oh. Thank you.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.258
Okay, Homer,

09:52.341 --> 09:53.968
let's get a level check
on your voice.

09:54.051 --> 09:59.265
She smells sheet smells
by the sheet store.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.683
Wait, wait.
Let me try it again.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.643
Relax, Homer.
You'll do fine.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.061
I'm June Bellamy.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.855
I do the voices
of Itchy and Scratchy.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.150
You?
But you're a lady.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.651
(as Itchy)
She's a lady, all right.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.279
(as Scratchy)
A beautiful lady.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.281
(laughing)

10:15.364 --> 10:17.950
Hey, that really is you.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.785
How'd you get
to be so good?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.954
Oh, just experience,
I suppose.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.497
I started out
as Roadrunner.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.708
-(as Roadrunner): Meep!
-You mean meep-meep?

10:25.791 --> 10:27.793
No, they only paid me
to say it once

10:27.877 --> 10:29.670
then they doubled it up
on the soundtrack.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.047
Cheap bastards.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.299
-You folks ready to begin?
-Uh, I guess.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.217
Is this episode going
on the air live?

10:35.301 --> 10:36.636
No, Homer.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.596
Very few cartoons
are broadcast live.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.556
It's a terrible strain
on the animator's wrist.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.237
Hi, question
for Miss Bellamy.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.031
In episode 2f09

10:57.114 --> 10:59.450
when Itchy plays Scratchy's
skeleton like a xylophone

10:59.533 --> 11:01.911
he strikes the same rib
twice in succession

11:01.994 --> 11:05.081
yet he produces
two clearly different tones.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.583
I mean, what are we to believe
that this is some sort of...

11:07.667 --> 11:09.627
(derisive snort)

11:09.710 --> 11:11.504
Magic xylophone
or something?

11:11.587 --> 11:14.382
Boy, I really hope somebody
got fired for that blunder.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.675
Uh, well, uh...

11:15.758 --> 11:17.510
I'll field this one.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.969
Let me ask you a question.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.722
Why would a man whose shirt
says "Genius at work"

11:21.806 --> 11:24.892
spend all of his time watching
a children's cartoon show?

11:26.977 --> 11:28.854
I withdraw my question.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.483
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Simpson.

11:32.566 --> 11:35.653
On the "Itchy
& Scratchy" CD-ROM

11:35.736 --> 11:38.489
is there a way to get
out of the dungeon

11:38.572 --> 11:40.282
without using
the wizard key?

11:40.366 --> 11:41.784
What the hell
are you talking about?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.077
You're a lifesaver, Homer.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.913
I can't deal with
these hardcore fans.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.666
(clears throat)
Your attention, please!

11:48.749 --> 11:49.750
MAN:
Uh, in episode--

11:49.834 --> 11:52.294
Eh, your attention, please!

11:52.378 --> 11:54.130
Mr. Simpson
will now be autographing

11:54.213 --> 11:56.465
8-by-10 glossies of Poochie.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.759
One per customer.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.053
Please form a line.
There will be no cutting.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.389
I'm talking to you,
Mr. Cutter.

12:03.472 --> 12:04.765
Pardon me. Look out.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.643
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Hot soup.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.520
Hi. Kindly make
one out to me

12:09.603 --> 12:12.273
and three out to my friend
of the same name.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.775
MARGE: I'm so glad
you could join us

12:14.859 --> 12:16.068
for Homer's big premiere.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.987
BARNEY:
Poochie's based on me.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.281
Is this seat taken,
little girl?

12:20.364 --> 12:22.575
I'm not a girl.
Are you blind?

12:22.658 --> 12:23.826
Yes.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.786
I am stoked, Mr. S.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.663
Shh. Everybody,

(murmuring)

14:31.412 --> 14:34.832
(clearing throats)

14:34.915 --> 14:36.667
Homer,
I can honestly say

14:36.750 --> 14:38.878
that was the best episode
of "Impy and Chimpy"

14:38.961 --> 14:40.296
I've ever seen.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.714
Yeah, you should be
very proud, Homer.

14:41.797 --> 14:45.259
You, uh... You got
a beautiful home here.

14:51.348 --> 14:55.352
So, it was
pretty okay, huh?

14:55.436 --> 14:56.812
Mom, can we go to bed
without dinner?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.064
Yes, we can.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.482
(doors slam)

15:00.566 --> 15:02.234
Well,
at least I liked it.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.612
Didn't I?

15:04.695 --> 15:06.864
HOMER'S BRAIN: <i>Oh, you don't want</i>
<i>to know what I really think.</i>

15:06.947 --> 15:09.450
<i>Now,</i>
<i>look sad and say "D'oh."</i>

15:09.533 --> 15:11.035
D'oh.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.833
I'm the worst
Poochie ever.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.293
No, it's not
your fault, Dad.

15:19.376 --> 15:20.753
You did fine.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.588
It's just that
Poochie was a soulless

15:22.671 --> 15:24.548
by-product
of committee thinking.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.883
You can't be cool
just by spouting

15:25.966 --> 15:27.676
a bunch of
worn-out buzzwords.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.886
Don't have a cow, Lis.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.137
Bart's right.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.389
Let's none of us
have a cow.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.766
All that matters

15:33.849 --> 15:35.726
is that the fans
of the show liked it.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.811
Last night's
"Itchy & Scratchy" was,

15:37.895 --> 15:41.732
without a doubt,
the worst episode ever.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.443
Rest assured that I was
on the Internet within minutes

15:44.526 --> 15:46.612
registering my disgust
throughout the world.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.865
Hey, I know it wasn't great,
but what right do you have to complain?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.951
As a loyal viewer,
I feel they owe me.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.119
What?

15:54.203 --> 15:55.621
They're giving you thousands of hours
of entertainment for free.

15:55.704 --> 15:56.956
What could they possibly
owe you?

15:57.039 --> 15:59.291
I mean, if anything,
you owe them.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.669
Worst episode ever.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.504
It looks like
the beginning of the end

16:03.587 --> 16:05.798
for the venerable
"Itchy & Scratchy" program.

16:05.881 --> 16:09.093
For years, TV critics such
as yours truly, Kent Brockman,

16:09.176 --> 16:11.387
have waited impatiently
for cracks to appear

16:11.470 --> 16:13.597
in the show's
hilarious facade.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.975
Yesterday our prayers
were finally answered

16:16.058 --> 16:20.980
when Poochie the Dog made
his howlingly unfunny debut.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.565
Far be it for me
to gloat at another's downfall,

16:23.649 --> 16:24.858
but I have a feeling

16:24.942 --> 16:26.986
no children
are going to be crying

16:27.069 --> 16:29.238
when this puppy
is put to sleep.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.656
(laughing)

16:32.074 --> 16:33.242
(bawling)

16:33.325 --> 16:34.702
What the hell happened?

16:34.785 --> 16:36.537
Well, I'd attribute
the product failure

16:36.620 --> 16:38.872
to fundamental shifts
in our key demographic

16:38.956 --> 16:41.208
coupled with the overall
crumminess of Poochie.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.711
Whoa! You got to stop
this thing!

16:43.794 --> 16:46.547
(bawling)

16:46.630 --> 16:49.341
Please! I'm getting
egged on the street!

16:49.425 --> 16:52.428
Do something!
Do something!

16:52.511 --> 16:54.263
(sobbing)

16:54.346 --> 16:55.723
(knocking)

16:55.806 --> 16:57.850
Uh, hi, Mr. Myers.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.393
I've been doing
some thinking

16:59.476 --> 17:01.478
and I've got some ideas
to improve the show.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.230
I got it right here.

17:03.313 --> 17:06.692
Uh, one: Poochie needs
to be louder, angrier,

17:06.775 --> 17:09.278
and have access
to a time machine.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.989
Two: Whenever Poochie's
not on screen,

17:12.072 --> 17:14.575
all the other characters
should be asking,

17:14.658 --> 17:16.076
"Where's Poochie?"

17:16.160 --> 17:17.703
-Three...
-Great, great.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.663
Just leave them
right there on the floor

17:19.747 --> 17:21.498
on your way out.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.459
WRITER:
Thanks, Homer, great.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.670
Hmm...

17:26.754 --> 17:28.422
(muffled voices)

17:36.680 --> 17:39.516
Listen, guys we got to do
something about Poochie.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.643
KRUSTY: There's only one thing
we can do.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.900
Then they said they were going
to kill Poochie off!

17:47.983 --> 17:50.319
Really?
Oh, how terrible.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.071
Yes. Terrible.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.989
It's not your fault, Homer.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.991
It's those lousy writers.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.202
They make me madder
than a, um...

17:58.285 --> 17:59.787
Yak in heat!

17:59.870 --> 18:02.414
You're right, Marge.
It's not my fault.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.708
I'm not gonna let them treat
Poochie like dirt anymore

18:04.792 --> 18:06.627
just because
he's the new guy.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.212
Right on, Mr. S.!

18:08.295 --> 18:09.254
Put a sock in it, Roy.

18:10.839 --> 18:14.134
Okay, so here's where
Itchy lunges at Poochie

18:14.218 --> 18:15.719
with a rusty
chain saw.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.596
Cue sound effects.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.597
(chain saw buzzing)

18:18.680 --> 18:19.723
Rustier!

18:19.807 --> 18:21.725
(shrill buzzing)

18:21.809 --> 18:24.478
Are you prepared to die,
Poochie?

18:24.561 --> 18:27.397
No, I am not.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.109
Oh, cut, cut, cut, cut!

18:30.192 --> 18:32.611
Just stick to the script
as written, Homer.

18:32.694 --> 18:36.115
You're supposed to say,
"Please, cut off my head.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.324
I don't deserve to live."

18:37.407 --> 18:38.867
Never!

18:40.744 --> 18:43.122
(murmuring)

18:43.205 --> 18:45.833
You can't just kill off
a classic TV character.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.252
Poochie could be bigger
than curly fries

18:48.335 --> 18:50.587
but first he has to
win back the audience.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.840
That's why I'm going to read
these lines I wrote myself

18:52.923 --> 18:54.133
with my own two hands.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.676
Forget it, Homer!

18:55.759 --> 18:58.262
We can do this show
without you if we have to.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.972
But not without me.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.015
Aw, jeez.

19:02.099 --> 19:05.144
Let him try
the new lines.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.354
All right.
All right.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.231
We'll try it.
Action.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.816
Hi, Poochie!

19:10.899 --> 19:13.443
You look like you've
got something to say.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.486
Do you?

19:14.570 --> 19:17.197
Yes, I certainly do.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.241
Hello there, Itchy.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.993
I know there's
a lot of people

19:21.076 --> 19:23.495
who don't like me
and wish I would go away,

19:23.579 --> 19:26.456
but I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.333
I know I can come off
a little proactive

19:28.417 --> 19:29.960
and for that, I'm sorry.

19:30.043 --> 19:33.005
But if everyone could find
a place in their hearts

19:33.088 --> 19:35.549
for the little dog
nobody wanted

19:35.632 --> 19:38.177
I know we can
make them laugh

19:38.260 --> 19:41.638
and cry... until we
grow old together.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.682
And... cut.

19:56.111 --> 19:58.655
Now kids, I know you loved
the old Poochie,

19:58.739 --> 20:01.241
but the new one's
going to be better

20:01.325 --> 20:02.868
than ten Super Bowls!

20:02.951 --> 20:04.912
I don't want to oversell it.
Judge for yourself.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.665
<i>(buzzing)</i>

20:08.749 --> 20:10.083
<i>Well, look who's here!</i>

20:10.167 --> 20:11.668
<i>Hi, Poochie!</i>

20:11.752 --> 20:14.004
<i>You look like you've </i>
<i>got something to say.</i>

20:14.087 --> 20:15.130
<i>Do you?</i>

20:15.214 --> 20:17.424
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>I certainly do.</i>

20:17.507 --> 20:19.343
<i>MR. MYERS VOICE:</i>
<i>I have to go now.</i>

20:19.426 --> 20:20.886
<i>My planet needs me.</i>

20:24.640 --> 20:27.309
BART: Wow! Poochie came
from another planet?

20:27.392 --> 20:29.144
Uh, I guess.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.313
Hey, that wasn't
supposed to happen!

20:31.396 --> 20:33.523
Those finks
double-crossed me!

20:33.607 --> 20:35.150
<i>Poochie's dead!</i>

20:35.234 --> 20:37.152
<i>(goofy laugh)</i>

20:37.236 --> 20:39.279
<i>(cheering)</i>

20:39.363 --> 20:42.449
<i>Now kids, we all know that sometimes</i>
<i>when cartoon characters die,</i>

20:42.532 --> 20:44.326
<i>they're back again</i>
<i>the very next week.</i>

20:44.409 --> 20:46.703
<i>That's why I'm presenting</i>
<i>this sworn affidavit</i>

20:46.787 --> 20:51.416
<i>the Poochie will never,</i>
<i>ever, ever return!</i>

20:51.500 --> 20:54.419
<i>This document conforms to all</i>
<i>applicable laws and statutes.</i>

20:54.503 --> 20:56.630
<i>(kids cheer)</i>

20:56.713 --> 20:58.048
Oh, yeah.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.051
Tough break, Dad.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.886
I guess people just
weren't ready for Poochie.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.054
Maybe
in a few years.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.265
Good news, everybody.

21:06.348 --> 21:11.520
I'm moving into my own apartment
with two sexy ladies.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.022
Oh, then I guess
this is good-bye, Roy.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.024
Maybe we'll see you
in a few years.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.277
-(kisses)
-(clicks tongue)

21:18.360 --> 21:20.112
Well, I guess
I learned my lesson.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.530
The thing is,

21:21.613 --> 21:24.157
I lost creative control
of the project.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.119
And I forgot to ask
for any money.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.578
Well, live and learn.
