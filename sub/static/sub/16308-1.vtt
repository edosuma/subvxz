01:59.784 --> 02:02.188
Hey sweetheart.

02:02.287 --> 02:03.188
Hey baby!

02:03.289 --> 02:04.356
Yeah?

02:04.456 --> 02:05.490
Hey, hold on for a sec.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.526
Beautiful girl, what are you
doing out here all alone?

02:10.794 --> 02:12.132
Where you going?

02:12.231 --> 02:14.667
Need a ride?

02:14.766 --> 02:16.436
Excuse me?

02:16.536 --> 02:17.604
Yeah?

02:17.704 --> 02:19.272
We're
doing a documentary.

02:19.372 --> 02:20.874
Wonder if you have
a second to chat.

02:20.973 --> 02:22.407
I don't know,
I'm like on my way

02:22.508 --> 02:24.177
to work right now.

02:24.977 --> 02:26.378
We
were just wondering

02:26.479 --> 02:28.381
if we could ask you a
couple of questions.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.581
What kind of question's that?

02:29.681 --> 02:32.784
If I give you,
you know, something like that

02:32.884 --> 02:33.919
maybe you come in
here and answer

02:34.020 --> 02:35.155
the questions for us?

02:35.254 --> 02:36.489
Ah, that's a bit weird.

02:36.588 --> 02:37.289
What
if I offered you

02:37.389 --> 02:38.490
Little bit of cash?

02:38.591 --> 02:39.626
A little bit of cash?

02:39.725 --> 02:40.759
All right.

02:42.961 --> 02:44.396
Hey,
you like that?

02:44.497 --> 02:46.432
Oh, just take it.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.905
All right, thank you so
much for helping us out.

02:52.004 --> 02:53.772
I bet you don't have any
trouble at the clubs, do you?

02:53.872 --> 02:55.207
We don't have much trouble.

02:55.307 --> 02:57.442
You
seem like a fun girl.

02:57.543 --> 02:59.444
You like to party?

02:59.544 --> 03:01.613
You know, you have
a lot of layers on.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.584
It's cold outside.

03:04.683 --> 03:05.852
So, what
are you up to today?

03:05.951 --> 03:07.819
I'm walking home from school.

03:07.919 --> 03:09.321
Walking
home from school,

03:09.421 --> 03:10.355
very nice.

03:10.455 --> 03:11.390
School girl.

03:11.491 --> 03:12.692
Hah, that's always hot.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.193
- When was the last
time you had sex?

03:14.294 --> 03:15.628
Well, that's why we broke up.

03:15.728 --> 03:18.198
It's been a while.

03:20.633 --> 03:21.768
Now what
you got under that hoodie?

03:21.867 --> 03:22.634
Why don't you take that off?

03:22.735 --> 03:24.470
It's hot in here.

03:28.039 --> 03:29.341
It was a fishing boat.

03:29.442 --> 03:30.242
He
had a fishing boat?

03:30.342 --> 03:31.276
Yeah.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.110
Let's see a little bit more skin.

03:32.111 --> 03:33.478
So can you take your shirt off?

03:33.579 --> 03:34.881
Question one.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.248
Question one?

03:36.348 --> 03:37.516
- Depends, what kind
of cash do you have?

03:37.616 --> 03:38.917
Oh, okay.

03:39.018 --> 03:40.520
Look at you, little
business lady.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.254
Ooh oh oh!

03:42.354 --> 03:43.388
You see that oh?

03:43.489 --> 03:44.356
She wants it right away.

03:44.456 --> 03:45.490
What do I gotta do for this?

04:57.028 --> 04:58.463
I want you to
look at the camera and say

04:58.564 --> 05:00.800
"Hi, daddy".

05:00.899 --> 05:02.834
Hi, daddy.

05:14.045 --> 05:16.716
All right
baby, see you later!

05:16.815 --> 05:17.983
Yeah, that's right, bitch!

05:18.084 --> 05:19.584
We got your money!

05:21.153 --> 05:22.322
So degrading.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.457
Ugh,
you're telling me!

05:26.524 --> 05:28.394
- How am I supposed to
come back from North Korea

05:28.494 --> 05:30.863
and do a piece like this?

05:30.963 --> 05:32.398
You said you wanted a break

05:32.497 --> 05:33.733
from the horrors
of dictatorship,

05:33.833 --> 05:35.968
and I believe the term you
used was "fluff piece".

05:36.067 --> 05:37.736
- Well, this is a little on
the nose, don't you think?

05:37.836 --> 05:39.872
Boss thought it was funny.

05:41.607 --> 05:42.575
Not funny at all.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.643
So, what?

05:43.742 --> 05:44.576
You're not interested
or you think

05:44.677 --> 05:45.812
the wife will give you shit?

05:45.911 --> 05:47.379
Both.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.450
- Come on, Mark, my spidey
senses are tingling here.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.085
I think we have
some actual angles.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.821
These guys have started
their own little smut empire.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.355
Yeah, but who cares?

05:56.456 --> 05:57.689
What, you don't watch porn?

05:57.790 --> 05:58.858
Nope.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.660
Come on!

06:00.759 --> 06:02.594
Not like this!

06:06.130 --> 06:08.800
I don't know.

06:08.901 --> 06:11.437
Don't puss out on me.

06:11.536 --> 06:13.839
- I just can't believe there's
a market for this garbage.

06:13.939 --> 06:16.007
- These guys offer
something different.

06:16.108 --> 06:18.377
They pick up random
girls and coax them

06:18.478 --> 06:19.912
into having sex.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.146
Well, that's bullshit.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.682
Exactly!

06:22.781 --> 06:24.449
First we prove that these
girls are total plants,

06:24.550 --> 06:26.919
then we springboard into
a serious psychoanalytical

06:27.019 --> 06:30.122
and social commentary
piece on internet porn.

06:33.526 --> 06:34.761
You're hilarious.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.062
Why do you have such a hard
on for these guys, dude?

06:36.161 --> 06:40.165
- Because these guys
objectify women, dude.

06:40.266 --> 06:41.434
Aren't they paying us?

06:41.533 --> 06:42.534
Fuck 'em.

06:42.634 --> 06:43.603
They want exposure.

06:43.702 --> 06:45.070
They didn't say what kind.

06:45.170 --> 06:46.671
I've seen stuff that's
worse than this,

06:46.771 --> 06:48.974
and I know you have too.

06:49.074 --> 06:51.076
At least no one's dying here.

06:51.177 --> 06:54.080
Yeah. At least no one's dying.

07:04.589 --> 07:05.824
Yeah, you gotta have off.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.161
Yeah, I mean, with this
weather, are you kidding me?

07:10.762 --> 07:11.697
Ugh, it's the wife.

07:11.797 --> 07:13.966
Hold on a sec.

07:14.065 --> 07:16.168
Hey, babe, how you feeling?

07:17.836 --> 07:19.105
Ah, no.

07:19.204 --> 07:20.939
There's some crazy weather
coming into Seattle

07:21.040 --> 07:22.575
so they rerouted us to Portland,

07:22.675 --> 07:25.545
and we were having a hard
time getting a flight,

07:25.644 --> 07:28.447
but my co-producer
extraordinaire got us

07:28.548 --> 07:30.483
the best pilot on the west coast

07:30.583 --> 07:32.452
and he's gonna fly
us in right now.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.687
I'll be back in like 48 hours.

07:36.521 --> 07:37.557
I know, I know.

07:37.656 --> 07:39.459
Look, it's an easy one, okay?

07:39.559 --> 07:40.626
I love you too.

07:40.725 --> 07:42.595
Okay, take care of
that bun in the oven.

07:58.043 --> 07:59.010
I can't believe
we're meeting these guys

07:59.110 --> 07:59.911
on a street corner.

08:00.012 --> 08:00.947
You tell the wife?

08:01.047 --> 08:02.181
Ah, not yet.

08:02.281 --> 08:04.216
Pussy.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.786
Excuse me.

08:06.886 --> 08:07.987
You know what's crazy

08:08.086 --> 08:10.255
is I have no idea what
to expect right now.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.026
Oh! That's camera.

08:14.125 --> 08:15.527
What up, beautiful people?

08:15.627 --> 08:16.895
You the guy from Xice Magazine?

08:16.995 --> 08:18.096
Yeah, I'm Mark.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.764
What's with the last-minute
location change?

08:19.865 --> 08:21.100
I thought we were doing this
interview at your office.

08:21.199 --> 08:22.968
- Yeah, I just thought it'd
be better for the story,

08:23.069 --> 08:24.504
get to know me a
little bit better,

08:24.603 --> 08:26.771
see me in my element, a
little bit of atmosphere.

08:26.872 --> 08:27.907
Who is this?

08:28.007 --> 08:29.108
This is Sue.

08:29.208 --> 08:32.144
- Hi, Susan Chen,
Mark's videographer.

08:33.312 --> 08:34.113
Videographer?

08:34.212 --> 08:35.246
Yeah.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.181
- I thought you
worked for a magazine.

08:36.282 --> 08:37.616
Yeah, we shoot everything

08:37.716 --> 08:39.251
for the online magazine,
and then that saves me

08:39.351 --> 08:41.220
having to take notes.

08:43.355 --> 08:44.524
- Ah, you're not
gonna like this,

08:44.624 --> 08:45.957
but that's a no-go.

08:46.057 --> 08:47.125
It's only our cameras
allowed in the van,

08:47.225 --> 08:49.896
I mean, unless little Suzie
Chu here wants to get naked

08:49.995 --> 08:51.663
and play around with Johnny-boy.

08:51.764 --> 08:53.132
Suzie what?!

08:54.032 --> 08:55.868
- Um, look, we worked this out
with your people weeks ago.

08:55.967 --> 08:57.937
- What can I say, the
rules are the rules.

08:58.903 --> 09:00.806
Are we gonna have a
problemo, or what?

09:02.073 --> 09:03.208
Ah, I dunno.

09:03.308 --> 09:04.910
Let me just have a
chat with my partner.

09:05.010 --> 09:05.778
Okay?

09:05.878 --> 09:07.213
Sure.

09:07.312 --> 09:10.081
Love watching you leave,
Suzie Choo-choo-choose me.

09:10.182 --> 09:10.950
Oh, that's a good one.

09:12.652 --> 09:13.686
Ugh.

09:13.785 --> 09:14.819
I want to punch that
guy in the face.

09:15.754 --> 09:16.254
I can't believe they
get girls into that van.

09:16.355 --> 09:17.623
I know.

09:17.722 --> 09:18.790
- Ugh, now they've
got the camera on us.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.125
That guy's an asshole.

09:20.225 --> 09:23.028
- Well, that's exactly how
I'm gonna make him look.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.264
You're gonna stay?

09:25.364 --> 09:27.300
I'm here.

09:27.399 --> 09:28.199
Oh, shit.

09:28.299 --> 09:30.802
Mark smells a story.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.171
All right, well,

09:32.270 --> 09:33.939
I still get paid?

09:34.039 --> 09:35.875
Of course.

09:37.808 --> 09:39.945
Okay, have fun.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.715
I'm sure it's gonna be
a tough day for you.

09:42.815 --> 09:43.883
Yeah, yeah, fuck off.

09:43.982 --> 09:44.916
I'll see you at the office.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.319
See ya!

09:46.418 --> 09:48.120
So, gentlemen.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.723
So, what's the plan?

09:50.822 --> 09:51.723
- Well, we're
gonna make a movie.

09:51.823 --> 09:52.891
You ready?

09:52.991 --> 09:54.059
Really?

09:54.159 --> 09:55.093
It's a little early
for porn, isn't it?

09:57.096 --> 09:57.929
Yeah, right.

09:58.029 --> 09:59.298
Actually in our industry,

09:59.398 --> 10:01.033
the early worm catches the
bird, if you get my drift.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.368
Very clever.

10:02.467 --> 10:05.136
All right. Hop in.

10:05.236 --> 10:06.038
Back here?

10:06.138 --> 10:07.840
Yeah.

10:11.476 --> 10:13.879
- So, this is where
the magic happens?

10:13.979 --> 10:15.915
Yeah, watch out for stains.

10:16.014 --> 10:16.948
All right, introductions.

10:17.048 --> 10:18.717
This here is my boy John.

10:18.817 --> 10:19.818
I got him doing
double duty today.

10:19.918 --> 10:21.019
He's going to be
driving and fucking,

10:21.120 --> 10:22.754
'cause you're an extra
body, and an artist

10:22.855 --> 10:23.889
needs his space to work.

10:23.989 --> 10:24.824
'Sup, man?

10:24.923 --> 10:25.890
'Sup, man.

10:25.990 --> 10:27.158
So, you really do this at 10 AM?

10:27.259 --> 10:29.128
God damn right.

10:31.697 --> 10:34.166
- All right, Johnny-boy,
start the engine.

10:34.265 --> 10:37.168
These hoes ain't
gonna come to us.

10:37.269 --> 10:38.903
All right.

10:39.004 --> 10:42.140
Woo! Yeah
baby, let's do it!

10:57.956 --> 11:01.694
- So, gentlemen, how
does this usually work?

11:01.793 --> 11:04.929
We just drive around
until we find a cute girl

11:05.029 --> 11:06.932
who wants to have sex
in the back of a van

11:07.032 --> 11:08.401
at 10 in the morning?

11:08.500 --> 11:09.668
Well, yeah, pretty much,

11:09.769 --> 11:12.437
and I'm ready to
get my dick wet.

11:12.538 --> 11:15.206
- I'd rather you
not do that, man.

11:15.307 --> 11:17.076
- Oh, what, you
don't like it either?

11:17.176 --> 11:18.344
What's the story behind that?

11:18.443 --> 11:20.278
- Well, the story is I'm
interviewing you, so.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.281
- Lighten up, buddy,
it's just a camera.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.848
You want and interview or not?

11:23.948 --> 11:25.317
- I think you need me
more than I need you.

11:25.417 --> 11:27.452
- I didn't know this
was a pissing contest.

11:27.552 --> 11:29.154
You're making it one.

11:29.254 --> 11:30.722
Really?

11:30.822 --> 11:33.225
Well, how far did you fly
to be here with us, Mark?

11:33.325 --> 11:35.227
- I've flown a lot
further than this, Steve.

11:35.326 --> 11:37.096
I though it
wasn't a pissing contest.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.230
Look.

11:39.331 --> 11:41.067
This interview can
go two ways, right?

11:41.167 --> 11:43.836
Either you give me full
access, we have some fun,

11:43.936 --> 11:46.471
I write a nice article, and
your company gets more exposure,

11:46.572 --> 11:48.106
or...

11:48.206 --> 11:49.240
we do the opposite.

11:49.341 --> 11:50.842
My publisher talked
to your company.

11:50.942 --> 11:53.044
Money might have exchanged
hands, it doesn't matter,

11:53.144 --> 11:54.980
either way, I'm here
because you guys wanted

11:55.080 --> 11:56.449
more publicity, right?

11:56.548 --> 11:58.116
So if it's gonna be a no,

11:58.216 --> 12:00.119
I'd rather know now,
before I have to see

12:00.219 --> 12:01.887
your boy John naked.

12:01.986 --> 12:02.855
- Oh, you want to
see John naked.

12:02.955 --> 12:04.724
My dick is magnificent.

12:06.490 --> 12:07.893
- It's up to you, man,
what do you think?

12:09.126 --> 12:10.829
All right, chief, fire away.

12:10.929 --> 12:12.263
Great.

12:13.264 --> 12:15.900
Okay, so, where should we start?

12:16.999 --> 12:17.870
How long you been employed?

12:17.970 --> 12:19.038
- What, you didn't
do your homework?

12:19.138 --> 12:20.506
It's three years.

12:20.605 --> 12:22.173
Before that you were
in the film industry,

12:22.274 --> 12:23.842
but I just needed
it for the record.

12:23.942 --> 12:25.177
Bingo!

12:25.277 --> 12:26.778
- How much money you guys
making off the website?

12:26.879 --> 12:28.114
A lot.

12:28.214 --> 12:28.981
What's a lot?

12:29.081 --> 12:30.316
A lot is a lot, man.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.217
Jesus Christ.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.217
A lot's a lot.

12:32.317 --> 12:33.384
What about you, John?

12:33.485 --> 12:35.421
What got you into
the porn business?

12:35.520 --> 12:37.522
- Mm, 'cause I get to
nail hot chicks all day.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.024
That's why I do this shit.

12:39.124 --> 12:41.393
Okay, what
about you, Steve?

12:42.427 --> 12:43.495
What about me?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.063
Why'd you start this business?

12:45.163 --> 12:47.866
- 'Cause I get to film my
buddy Holmes Junior here?

12:47.966 --> 12:49.100
Whoa, hell yeah, mothafucker!

12:49.201 --> 12:50.936
- Why do you call
him Holmes Junior?

12:51.035 --> 12:53.037
- Well, you know that
porn star John Holmes?

12:53.138 --> 12:54.440
Yeah.

12:54.539 --> 12:56.274
- Well, my dick is a quarter
of an inch shorter than his.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.409
This close.

12:58.509 --> 13:01.179
That's lovely.

13:01.279 --> 13:02.380
So what about you, Mark?

13:02.480 --> 13:04.182
- What, are you asking
my dick size too?

13:08.186 --> 13:09.187
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.121
Check out this one.

13:10.221 --> 13:11.055
Look at her ass, holy shit.

13:11.155 --> 13:12.190
Up here.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.160
Yeah, she has got a
serious case of RCA.

13:14.259 --> 13:15.226
What's RCA?

13:15.326 --> 13:16.327
- Raging cock
addiction, and bad.

13:16.427 --> 13:18.297
Oh my god, wow.

13:18.397 --> 13:19.932
Dude, we gotta
come back for her.

13:20.032 --> 13:21.567
Yeah, we will,
just calm down, cowboy.

13:21.667 --> 13:25.870
- So these girls that you
pick up off the street,

13:25.971 --> 13:28.106
you rehearse with them
before you shoot, or...?

13:28.206 --> 13:29.240
No, no rehearsals.

13:29.341 --> 13:30.241
It's actually pretty simple.

13:30.341 --> 13:32.177
We just pick them up, we
offer them some money,

13:32.278 --> 13:33.546
they take off their clothes,

13:33.645 --> 13:35.447
and Johnny-boy here
sticks them with his dick.

13:35.547 --> 13:36.382
They fuck for a buck.

13:36.481 --> 13:37.882
Exactly, yeah.

13:37.982 --> 13:38.416
We can get them to do
anything we want them to do.

13:38.517 --> 13:39.385
Come on.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.318
Believe it, bro.

13:40.418 --> 13:41.821
Yeah, see, the trick is

13:41.921 --> 13:43.088
everybody else uses pros.

13:43.187 --> 13:46.158
We're the only bona fide
amateur porn station.

13:46.258 --> 13:48.961
The ladies agree out of
pure charm and seduction.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.362
Seduction or manipulation?

13:50.461 --> 13:52.997
Uh, seduction.

13:53.097 --> 13:54.299
Okay, we'll call it seduction.

13:54.399 --> 13:56.334
What kind of seduction
are we talking about?

13:56.434 --> 13:58.136
- Well, that's why
you're here, Mark.

13:58.236 --> 13:59.938
You're here to bear witness.

14:00.038 --> 14:03.308
I, Steve Coulter, am the
most persuasive prick

14:03.408 --> 14:04.543
in the business!

14:04.643 --> 14:08.080
I'm the only guy with
100% amateur rating.

14:08.179 --> 14:10.982
Like, you know how guys,
they're really good at math?

14:11.082 --> 14:12.851
Or they can play the piano,

14:12.951 --> 14:14.385
or painting the Sistine
Chapel or something?

14:14.485 --> 14:16.989
They're blessed with
abilities that nobody knows

14:17.089 --> 14:18.023
why they have them.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.091
Ah, idiot savants?

14:19.191 --> 14:20.392
He's funny.

14:20.491 --> 14:22.160
- Yeah, I don't know
about the idiot part,

14:22.260 --> 14:23.928
but savants, geniuses,

14:24.028 --> 14:25.129
call it whatever you will,

14:25.230 --> 14:26.999
but for whatever
reason, I was blessed

14:27.099 --> 14:28.500
with the peerless
ability to get women

14:28.600 --> 14:30.870
to take off their
clothes and fuck.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.638
I'm not good at
much, but at this,

14:32.738 --> 14:34.907
I'm a fucking ninja.

14:35.006 --> 14:35.875
I am the master.

14:35.975 --> 14:37.176
I could do it in my sleep.

14:37.275 --> 14:38.243
I mean, I didn't
have you come here

14:38.344 --> 14:39.177
to make me more money, man.

14:39.278 --> 14:40.012
Look around.

14:40.111 --> 14:41.279
We're doing fine.

14:41.379 --> 14:43.014
I want someone to capture this

14:43.115 --> 14:44.416
for pure posterity.

14:44.515 --> 14:46.150
- Oh, hey, hey, whoa,
look at these two.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.987
Whoa, wait, two?

14:51.188 --> 14:52.891
Is there a problem?

14:52.991 --> 14:56.995
- No, this is where
you watch and learn.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.431
All right.

14:59.530 --> 15:00.498
Hey,
excuse me, ladies.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.033
Do you have a second?

15:02.134 --> 15:03.635
What is it?

15:03.735 --> 15:05.437
- We're film students
doing a documentary

15:05.537 --> 15:06.971
on the neighborhood
and we were wondering

15:07.072 --> 15:08.206
if we could ask you a
couple of questions?

15:08.307 --> 15:09.541
Like a survey?

15:09.640 --> 15:11.075
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.578
Like a survey.

15:12.677 --> 15:14.379
We could throw you a
little bit of cash.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.048
We're kind of in a tough spot,

15:16.148 --> 15:17.449
'cause we need to hand
it in by tomorrow.

15:19.583 --> 15:21.052
All right.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.053
Shoot.

15:22.153 --> 15:23.288
All right. Well, just hop in.

15:25.322 --> 15:26.125
In there?

15:26.225 --> 15:27.293
- Yeah!
Yeah, in here.

15:27.393 --> 15:28.192
Why not?

15:28.293 --> 15:29.327
What did my parents say

15:29.427 --> 15:30.562
about getting into
vans with strangers?

15:30.662 --> 15:31.629
Oh, come on.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.197
We're not kidnappers
or pedophiles,

15:33.298 --> 15:34.466
we're just three handsome dudes.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.468
What's the worst
that could happen?

15:37.601 --> 15:38.971
All right, fine.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.306
I'll offer you a little
bit more in cash, okay?

15:40.405 --> 15:42.707
How's that look?

15:42.807 --> 15:45.210
You like that?

15:45.309 --> 15:46.711
Okay.

15:46.812 --> 15:50.615
See? So easy, just hop in.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.650
Beautiful. Thank you.

16:03.561 --> 16:06.065
All right, well, I'm Steve,

16:06.164 --> 16:08.466
this is John, and
this here is Mark.

16:08.567 --> 16:10.235
Hi.

16:10.335 --> 16:11.737
I'm Sam.

16:11.836 --> 16:13.639
This is Beth.

16:13.739 --> 16:15.107
So, what do you do?

16:15.206 --> 16:16.207
I'm a writer.

16:16.307 --> 16:17.375
For documentaries?

16:17.475 --> 16:18.977
No, I'm a journalists.

16:20.178 --> 16:20.980
- Yeah, actually, Mark here,
he writes the questions for us.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.247
Ask me a question.

16:23.014 --> 16:25.250
- Okay, why did
you choose to get

16:25.350 --> 16:28.354
in a van full of strangers
for a bunch of money?

16:29.788 --> 16:32.024
Education.

16:32.124 --> 16:32.992
Of course.

16:33.091 --> 16:33.992
Okay, okay, all right.

16:34.092 --> 16:35.560
Johnny-boy, hit the gas.

16:35.660 --> 16:37.395
Let's do this.

16:44.134 --> 16:45.069
So, ladies.

16:45.169 --> 16:46.404
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mark.

16:46.504 --> 16:48.706
Let's get to know these
girls a little bit better.

16:48.807 --> 16:51.442
Look at Sam. Isn't
she beautiful?

16:51.543 --> 16:53.512
Sam, you're fucking smoking hot,

16:53.611 --> 16:55.046
if you don't mind me saying.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.682
But I guess you hear that
all the time, don't you?

16:57.715 --> 16:58.517
Yeah.

16:58.616 --> 16:59.250
Yeah, I knew it.

16:59.350 --> 17:00.552
So, are you from around here?

17:00.652 --> 17:02.086
Born and raised.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.422
All right, we got
ourselves another local.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.124
Another local?

17:05.223 --> 17:09.327
You guys do this often?

17:09.428 --> 17:11.262
Shit.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.432
You look familiar.

17:15.133 --> 17:17.036
Really?

17:19.871 --> 17:21.339
Yeah.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.574
Have you ever been
on camera before?

17:22.673 --> 17:24.276
Yeah, like something dirty?

17:24.375 --> 17:26.176
You two know each other?

17:26.278 --> 17:27.311
No.

17:27.412 --> 17:29.048
- So, you guys
are all strangers?

17:29.147 --> 17:30.214
You've never met?

17:30.315 --> 17:31.583
Wanna get to know me?

17:31.682 --> 17:34.552
- Yes, yes, Sam, I want
to get to know you.

17:34.653 --> 17:36.387
To tell you the truth,
I couldn't give a shit

17:36.488 --> 17:37.823
about getting a good grade
on this doc for school,

17:37.923 --> 17:40.224
'cause now that you're a
couple burners in my van

17:40.325 --> 17:42.461
and the camera
rolling, well, it's

17:42.560 --> 17:44.462
it's got me thinking.

17:45.563 --> 17:48.467
Could you two hold hands?

17:48.567 --> 17:50.201
I'll pay extra.

17:50.301 --> 17:52.804
- I thought this
was a documentary.

17:52.904 --> 17:54.239
I have a nice secluded spot,

17:54.338 --> 17:56.607
we could park and
nobody'll bother us.

17:56.708 --> 17:59.445
- How much money are
we talking about?

17:59.545 --> 18:01.680
Hold on.

18:01.779 --> 18:03.481
Can you two make out?

18:03.582 --> 18:05.184
I wanna know if you
two can make out,

18:05.284 --> 18:07.753
and then we'll talk business.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.822
You want us to kiss?

18:09.922 --> 18:12.758
- You kind of want to kiss
each other, don't you?

18:12.857 --> 18:15.827
Just close friends
getting closer.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.729
I don't know.

18:17.828 --> 18:19.130
This is pretty weird.

18:19.230 --> 18:20.465
Well, it's a cliche, I mean,

18:20.566 --> 18:21.365
you're in a van with a
bunch of guys who want to

18:21.465 --> 18:22.700
watch you kiss your friend,

18:22.800 --> 18:24.769
but I'm not asking you
to do anything dangerous.

18:24.869 --> 18:28.206
I mean, isn't it on
your bucket list?

18:28.307 --> 18:31.110
Do something naughty,
once in your life?

18:31.210 --> 18:33.444
Feel your heart racing?

18:34.578 --> 18:36.315
All right.

18:37.582 --> 18:39.651
Sure.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.720
All right.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.657
Oh yeah.

18:46.523 --> 18:47.525
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.161
That's really nice.

18:49.260 --> 18:49.894
Nice.

18:49.994 --> 18:52.630
That's really nice.

18:52.730 --> 18:53.832
Okay, now do it again.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.534
Okay, now how much
are you paying them for this?

18:55.634 --> 18:57.635
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
just let it be, all right?

18:57.736 --> 18:59.905
And now we're in fantasy land.

19:00.005 --> 19:01.206
Yeah, Steve.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.774
How much are you
paying us for this?

19:02.874 --> 19:04.876
Hold on.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.479
Beth, can you pull
down Sam's top

19:07.578 --> 19:09.514
and give her a
little kiss there?

19:10.781 --> 19:12.617
I don't know.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.586
Can't people see
through the windows?

19:14.685 --> 19:15.553
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:15.653 --> 19:17.189
These windows are really tinted.

19:17.288 --> 19:18.356
Maybe...

19:18.457 --> 19:21.593
maybe somewhere else?

19:21.692 --> 19:23.427
- Well, I gotta see
the merchandise first,

19:23.528 --> 19:24.930
before I set value

19:25.029 --> 19:28.200
if you catch my drift.

19:32.604 --> 19:34.640
All right.

19:34.740 --> 19:35.540
Atta girls.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.843
Let's have some fun.

19:37.942 --> 19:39.443
You like fun do you?

19:39.544 --> 19:40.913
Oh, yes, yes I do.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.549
Oh yeah.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.552
Yeah, look at those little pups.

19:46.652 --> 19:49.654
Beautiful, Sam, beautiful.

19:49.755 --> 19:52.457
Okay, Beth, now it's your turn.

19:52.557 --> 19:53.392
Okay.

19:53.491 --> 19:54.526
Really?

19:54.625 --> 19:56.561
But not here.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.396
Seriously?

20:00.030 --> 20:01.832
Sorry, who are you again?

20:01.932 --> 20:02.667
I'm a writer.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.369
Yes, he's a writer.

20:05.737 --> 20:06.605
This is where we turn.

20:06.704 --> 20:07.705
Okay, great.

20:07.806 --> 20:10.875
I just need you girls to
sign a couple release forms.

20:10.976 --> 20:12.244
Here you go.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.313
It's for the documentary.

20:15.712 --> 20:17.982
Oh, the documentary.

20:57.455 --> 20:58.490
- Wait a minute, let
me get this straight.

20:58.589 --> 20:59.657
You guys are walking
down the street,

20:59.758 --> 21:00.859
we roll up, and
now you're willing

21:00.959 --> 21:03.562
to let us film you
in the back of a van?

21:03.662 --> 21:05.264
For money?

21:05.364 --> 21:06.798
Sure.

21:07.699 --> 21:08.800
You're killing me here, Mark.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.802
- You're not very
much fun, Mark.

21:10.902 --> 21:12.403
Where were
you two going today?

21:12.503 --> 21:13.671
The mall.

21:13.771 --> 21:14.673
The mall?

21:14.772 --> 21:16.007
You wanna see our tits or not?

21:16.107 --> 21:17.742
- Oh, yeah, bring
me the boobies.

21:17.843 --> 21:18.877
Easy.

21:18.977 --> 21:20.412
Find a place to
pull over, buddy,

21:21.578 --> 21:23.781
and I'll get you all the boobies
you can shake a stick at.

21:23.882 --> 21:26.351
Okay, Sam, I want
you to bend over.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.988
I want you to show us
that ass a little bit.

21:30.087 --> 21:32.923
Oh shit that's hot.

21:33.023 --> 21:34.425
That's nice.

21:34.526 --> 21:35.360
You like that?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.395
Oh, shit, that is hot.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.765
Okay, now, I want you
to pull that top off.

21:40.698 --> 21:43.302
Okay, but I want you
to do it real slow.

21:43.402 --> 21:43.969
Really slow.

21:44.068 --> 21:44.970
There we go.

21:45.069 --> 21:47.038
Atta girl.

21:47.138 --> 21:49.707
John, you seeing this?

21:49.807 --> 21:50.776
That's some good stuff, man.

21:50.875 --> 21:52.443
Yeah, daddy likes it.

21:52.544 --> 21:53.445
Here's the pull over.

21:53.545 --> 21:54.446
Perfect.

21:54.546 --> 21:55.614
Just take us in a little bit,

21:55.713 --> 21:56.580
then get back here
and show these girlies

21:56.681 --> 21:58.317
what Holmes Junior's all about.

21:59.450 --> 22:02.321
All right, good
girl, Sam, good girl.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.456
Okay, now, Beth, want
you to get in the shot.

22:04.556 --> 22:07.992
Want you to pull
down that bra, okay?

22:08.093 --> 22:08.759
Okay?

22:08.859 --> 22:09.894
Hey, Beth?

22:09.994 --> 22:10.928
Beth?

22:11.762 --> 22:12.596
What the fuck!

22:12.696 --> 22:13.564
Hey!

22:13.664 --> 22:14.832
Don't fucking move.

22:29.579 --> 22:31.082
Fucker.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.553
Hurry up, Sam, we
need to get moving.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.488
I am. He's heavy!

22:40.557 --> 22:45.931
Oh god.

23:14.526 --> 23:15.627
What the fuck is going on?

23:18.528 --> 23:20.499
Shut the fuck up!

23:20.598 --> 23:23.167
Not so tough now, are you?

23:26.871 --> 23:28.807
Who are you?

23:28.906 --> 23:30.174
- Do you believe
in karma, Steve?

23:30.275 --> 23:31.509
No!

23:31.609 --> 23:32.576
I'm like the Seal
Team Six of karma.

23:32.676 --> 23:33.778
Get their phones.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.518
Hey, hey...

23:39.617 --> 23:45.617
And tie their hands.

23:50.961 --> 23:52.963
Who's this?

23:53.064 --> 23:54.699
It's my wife.

23:54.798 --> 23:55.767
She's pregnant.

23:55.866 --> 23:57.536
Yeah, we're due in two weeks.

23:57.635 --> 24:00.838
Listen, I was flown in
here from New York, okay

24:00.939 --> 24:02.807
There's an X-Bus in New York?

24:02.907 --> 24:04.009
No.

24:05.009 --> 24:06.677
I am here doing a story
on them for a magazine!

24:06.778 --> 24:07.711
Yeah, bullshit.

24:09.046 --> 24:10.215
It's not bullshit.

24:10.315 --> 24:12.817
You can check in my bag,
my wallet's in there.

24:12.917 --> 24:17.721
Give me his wallet.

24:22.058 --> 24:23.795
Listen to me.

24:23.894 --> 24:25.029
Look, you can let me go.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.132
I'm not gonna say anything.

24:27.231 --> 24:28.466
You're a fucking journalist!

24:28.567 --> 24:29.567
Shut the fuck up, man!

24:29.667 --> 24:30.701
You write everything down!

24:30.801 --> 24:31.836
- This has nothing
to do with you!

24:31.936 --> 24:32.636
It's what you fucking do!

24:32.737 --> 24:34.139
Shut up! Shut up!

24:35.272 --> 24:36.807
Unless you are being
asked a question,

24:36.907 --> 24:38.142
you say nothing.

24:38.242 --> 24:39.677
I have a family, lady, okay?

24:39.778 --> 24:40.679
I don't work with these

24:40.778 --> 24:42.580
What the fuck did I just say?

24:42.681 --> 24:44.615
No!

24:46.083 --> 24:48.553
Okay! Okay!

24:51.122 --> 24:53.225
Get up. Get up.

24:54.991 --> 24:56.161
Get in the van.

24:56.260 --> 24:58.896
Put him in the back.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.164
Get up.

25:01.164 --> 25:02.968
Slowly. Move, move!

25:06.336 --> 25:07.571
Here.

25:07.672 --> 25:08.906
Sit down.

25:12.143 --> 25:13.178
All right, I need you to tell me

25:13.278 --> 25:14.578
exactly what you're doing here.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.648
- I told you, my
magazine hired me

25:16.748 --> 25:18.717
to do a story on these perverts.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.251
Why?

25:20.352 --> 25:22.921
- Because they paid my company
some money for exposure.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.855
Why you?

25:24.955 --> 25:26.190
- I've done a bunch
of crazy stories.

25:26.290 --> 25:28.058
I've been to some wild places.

25:28.159 --> 25:30.962
And now I'm in the woods
with a gun pointed at me.

25:31.061 --> 25:32.596
- Yeah, well, you weren't
supposed to be here.

25:32.696 --> 25:33.664
Well, then let me go.

25:33.765 --> 25:34.833
Well, you're involved!

25:34.932 --> 25:36.600
Not by choice!

25:38.970 --> 25:40.672
Fuck!

25:40.771 --> 25:41.873
What?

25:42.874 --> 25:42.906
It's not exactly going
the way I wanted it to.

25:43.473 --> 25:45.076
These things never do.

25:45.175 --> 25:46.977
Now that guy is dead,

25:47.077 --> 25:49.548
and I need to see this through
because I made a promise.

25:49.647 --> 25:50.314
To who?

25:50.414 --> 25:51.115
Who did you make a promise to?

25:51.215 --> 25:53.117
You can stop this.

25:53.218 --> 25:56.254
It is never too late.

25:56.354 --> 25:57.288
Look, my company has some of the

25:57.388 --> 25:58.622
best lawyers in the country.

25:59.557 --> 26:00.959
We get people out of
hot water all the time.

26:02.159 --> 26:03.962
I can help you out of this.

26:04.061 --> 26:05.930
Yeah, I've heard that before.

26:06.030 --> 26:06.964
Men are full of shit.

26:07.065 --> 26:07.865
I'm not full of shit.

26:07.965 --> 26:09.266
All men are full of shit!

26:09.366 --> 26:11.235
Just hear me out.

26:11.336 --> 26:17.336
Please.

26:22.380 --> 26:25.250
Did Steve do something to you?

26:25.349 --> 26:28.086
You could say that.

26:36.192 --> 26:37.828
Hey, babe.

26:39.296 --> 26:41.333
Think you could help me out?

26:41.432 --> 26:44.368
I got something
caught in my eye.

27:03.753 --> 27:04.923
Thank you.

27:05.022 --> 27:07.759
Did he hurt you?

27:07.858 --> 27:10.028
Listen, I can do an
article about this, okay?

27:10.127 --> 27:11.730
We can do an exclusive.

27:11.829 --> 27:14.398
I can tell your story and we
can get you a lot of attention,

27:14.499 --> 27:16.768
you just need to tell
me what this is about.

27:16.867 --> 27:19.037
- Hey, you wanna tell
me what's going on here?

27:22.173 --> 27:23.775
I don't know anything.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.910
Hey come on, you can tell me.

27:26.009 --> 27:27.878
Hey, listen, what are
you getting paid today?

27:27.979 --> 27:29.681
I'll double it, okay?

27:29.780 --> 27:30.914
And then I'll double it again.

27:31.015 --> 27:31.883
You just gotta tell me
what's going on here.

27:31.982 --> 27:33.117
Who is this bitch?

27:33.218 --> 27:34.219
She's not a bitch.

27:34.318 --> 27:35.854
- All right, all
right, your friend.

27:35.953 --> 27:36.954
Okay.

27:37.055 --> 27:39.024
She's a friend of yours.

27:39.923 --> 27:42.192
Why'd you invite
her to the shoot?

27:42.292 --> 27:44.895
She looks out for me.

27:47.731 --> 27:49.134
- I know you feel
trapped right now,

27:49.233 --> 27:50.801
and I know you feel
the only way out

27:50.902 --> 27:53.938
is to go deeper, but
that is not the answer.

27:55.372 --> 27:59.044
Come on, just talk to me, okay?

27:59.144 --> 28:00.310
I can help you out of this.

28:00.411 --> 28:02.747
You can trust me.

28:02.846 --> 28:04.081
This conversation's over.

28:04.182 --> 28:04.915
No, listen to me.

28:05.016 --> 28:05.817
Get up!

28:05.916 --> 28:06.951
Just tell me what he did!

28:07.050 --> 28:08.218
- If you don't start
listening to me,

28:08.318 --> 28:10.120
we're gonna have a problem.

28:10.221 --> 28:11.823
Don't fucking cross me.

28:11.923 --> 28:12.457
- You don't have to
point that at me.

28:12.557 --> 28:14.125
That's not necessary.

28:14.224 --> 28:15.426
Shut the fuck up.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.194
Move!

28:17.295 --> 28:19.029
Hey!

28:19.130 --> 28:20.999
Oh shit!

28:39.450 --> 28:41.452
What was that?

28:41.553 --> 28:42.921
What were you saying to him?

28:43.020 --> 28:45.255
- This has gotten
completely out of control.

28:45.355 --> 28:47.092
- You don't think
I don't know that?

28:49.492 --> 28:51.796
...who the fuck that is,

28:51.895 --> 28:54.264
and it really doesn't
help that you're

28:54.365 --> 28:56.934
running around in
there with Steve.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.807
Keep quiet!

29:03.907 --> 29:05.843
I'm trying to hear
what they're saying.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.413
- Augh, we gotta get
the fuck out of here.

29:09.513 --> 29:11.281
That's not gonna happen, man.

29:14.884 --> 29:17.855
- Fine, there's a
gun in the glove box.

29:18.823 --> 29:21.126
Whoa, hey.

29:21.226 --> 29:22.494
Tell me what you did to her.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.495
Me?

29:23.595 --> 29:25.063
I don't know that fucking bitch!

29:25.163 --> 29:26.765
- Well she sure
as fuck knows you.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.298
And I know you planted
them on the street,

29:28.398 --> 29:29.833
so you must know them.

29:29.933 --> 29:31.903
- There was only supposed
to be one girl, okay?

29:32.002 --> 29:32.903
One girl! Sam!

29:33.003 --> 29:34.838
I don't know who that
other fucking chick is!

29:34.939 --> 29:36.441
Knew it.

29:37.473 --> 29:38.876
- Oh, go fuck
yourself, all right!

29:38.977 --> 29:40.178
What does it matter now?

29:40.278 --> 29:42.380
- Okay, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.781
We gotta play it cool, okay?

29:43.882 --> 29:46.884
If she wanted us dead,
we'd already be dead.

29:46.984 --> 29:49.052
I don't think she knows
what her next move is.

29:49.153 --> 29:52.056
Let's not force her hand.

29:52.155 --> 29:54.192
Get out of my way.

29:56.192 --> 29:57.461
What are you doing, man?

29:57.561 --> 29:58.796
You're gonna get us
both killed, man.

29:58.896 --> 29:59.530
- Yeah, well, what
are you gonna do?

29:59.631 --> 30:00.932
Just fucking stand there?

30:01.031 --> 30:01.899
- I'm gonna find out
what she wants, okay?

30:02.000 --> 30:02.933
If we give her what she wants,

30:03.034 --> 30:04.102
I think we're gonna be okay.

30:04.201 --> 30:06.503
"We're gonna be okay"?

30:06.604 --> 30:07.337
"We're gonna be okay"?!

30:07.438 --> 30:08.540
Look at this guy!

30:08.640 --> 30:09.440
He's my best fucking
friend, and he's dead,

30:09.539 --> 30:11.142
and we're fucking next!

30:11.241 --> 30:12.076
If you hadn't attacked her,

30:12.175 --> 30:13.010
he'd still be alive right now.

30:13.111 --> 30:15.580
Fuck you, all right.

30:16.881 --> 30:18.082
You gotta be kidding me.

30:18.182 --> 30:19.550
What?

30:19.651 --> 30:21.352
It's fucking locked.

30:21.451 --> 30:22.519
Okay, well, listen.

30:22.619 --> 30:24.555
Let's just, let's
just calm down, okay?

30:24.655 --> 30:26.490
Let's think about this.

30:27.958 --> 30:29.494
Fuck this stupid-ass shit.

30:29.594 --> 30:30.327
Help!

30:30.428 --> 30:31.062
What are you doing?

30:31.162 --> 30:31.930
Help!

30:32.029 --> 30:33.530
- Shut up.
- Help!

30:33.631 --> 30:36.234
Help! Help!

30:36.334 --> 30:38.269
Help, please!

30:38.368 --> 30:40.370
Please help me!

30:40.471 --> 30:41.338
Shut the fuck up!

30:41.439 --> 30:42.273
Please!

30:42.373 --> 30:43.141
Shut up!

30:43.240 --> 30:44.107
You shut the fuck up!

30:44.208 --> 30:46.611
Please help me!

30:46.711 --> 30:47.945
- Dude, she's
coming, she's coming!

31:01.325 --> 31:03.294
- I told you not to
fucking cross me.

31:03.394 --> 31:05.296
Get the fuck up.

31:09.532 --> 31:11.336
Sam!

31:11.435 --> 31:13.538
Come here.

31:20.277 --> 31:22.279
Over there.

31:26.450 --> 31:28.253
Trying to run on me, Mark?

31:28.353 --> 31:31.489
And here I was starting to
think you were on my side.

31:31.588 --> 31:32.522
Sam.

31:32.623 --> 31:34.225
Sam, pay attention.

31:34.325 --> 31:35.593
Take this taser.

31:35.692 --> 31:38.496
If he moves or does
anything, you do this.

31:41.365 --> 31:42.967
Got it?

31:42.968 --> 31:43.701
Yes.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.903
Good. Stay put.

32:09.326 --> 32:10.327
Steve?

32:37.020 --> 32:38.221
Okay.

32:38.321 --> 32:40.625
You need to start talking now.

32:40.724 --> 32:43.226
Steve Coulter.

32:43.326 --> 32:46.364
Born February 21st, 1989.

32:47.498 --> 32:49.167
You're lying to me.

32:49.267 --> 32:50.134
She trusts you.

32:50.233 --> 32:51.368
You know that girl.

32:51.469 --> 32:52.703
I don't know anything!

32:52.804 --> 32:54.405
That is bullshit, okay!

32:54.505 --> 32:56.674
I wanna get the fuck
out of this van,

32:56.773 --> 32:58.108
right fucking now!

32:58.209 --> 32:59.143
Stop!

33:47.156 --> 33:48.058
So, what?

33:48.159 --> 33:50.128
Is she forcing you to do this?

33:50.228 --> 33:52.363
Just please stop.

33:52.462 --> 33:53.564
- I have nothing
to do with this,

33:53.663 --> 33:55.566
and I am stuck here, okay?

33:55.665 --> 33:58.068
I have a family that
I want to see again!

33:58.169 --> 33:59.370
I need you to help me.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.506
Shh! She'll be back soon.

34:01.605 --> 34:03.473
Your name's Sam, right?

34:04.740 --> 34:06.210
Do you know Steve?

34:06.309 --> 34:07.577
No.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.547
But you know Beth, right?

34:11.648 --> 34:13.217
I can't talk to you.

34:13.317 --> 34:15.619
Tell me what she wants.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.288
She wants him!

35:19.483 --> 35:21.419
Who the fuck is Beth, Sam?

35:21.518 --> 35:22.586
She's a friend!

35:44.307 --> 35:45.710
What kind of a friend?

35:45.809 --> 35:47.210
A new friend.

36:01.425 --> 36:03.693
Graduated 2007.

36:04.561 --> 36:07.365
Parents divorced in 2009.

36:08.431 --> 36:11.268
I know everything
about you, Steve.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.316
Not so smart now, are you?

36:25.416 --> 36:28.553
Fucking die right
here, you slut!

36:42.932 --> 36:44.668
She approached me.

36:44.768 --> 36:48.471
We became friends.

36:48.572 --> 36:50.508
She told me she needed my help.

36:52.643 --> 36:55.746
We've been through some
of the same things.

36:55.846 --> 36:57.548
- If you think you
can just sit here

36:57.648 --> 37:00.751
and be an innocent
bystander, you're wrong.

37:00.851 --> 37:03.788
- I didn't think it
was gonna be like this.

37:03.887 --> 37:06.523
I didn't want anyone to die.

37:06.623 --> 37:08.458
- We can help each other
get out of this alive, okay?

37:08.559 --> 37:09.794
Do you understand me?

37:09.893 --> 37:11.628
I need your help.

37:11.728 --> 37:15.232
- It's Steve. She
just wants Steve.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.601
Oh yeah?

37:16.701 --> 37:17.635
I don't think she's just
gonna let us walk out of here.

37:26.976 --> 37:29.679
What were you two doing?

37:29.780 --> 37:31.415
What?

37:34.384 --> 37:36.253
Sam?

37:39.623 --> 37:41.358
He was asking me questions.

37:41.458 --> 37:43.393
What was he asking you about?

37:43.494 --> 37:45.528
How we met.

37:46.396 --> 37:49.767
- And you didn't tell
him anything, did you?

37:49.867 --> 37:50.935
No.

37:53.570 --> 37:55.740
- Trying to get
information on me?

37:55.840 --> 37:58.675
- Nothing I wouldn't
ask you to your face.

37:58.775 --> 38:00.744
- You better slow
it down, Sherlock,

38:00.844 --> 38:02.946
because the more you know,
the less chance there is

38:03.047 --> 38:06.416
of you getting out of
here and getting on Oprah.

38:06.516 --> 38:08.418
I love Oprah.

38:11.655 --> 38:12.790
Get on your knees.

38:12.889 --> 38:14.858
Both of you get on your knees!

38:14.958 --> 38:16.993
Face away from each other.

38:17.094 --> 38:19.362
Tie them together.

38:27.403 --> 38:29.840
- What magazine
to you write for?

38:29.940 --> 38:31.608
It's called Xice Magazine.

38:31.708 --> 38:35.846
It's like a indie
pop culture magazine.

38:35.945 --> 38:37.014
Indie pop culture magazine

38:37.114 --> 38:39.382
- Stop fucking
entertaining him, Sam!

38:39.483 --> 38:41.686
Are you done? Get up here.

38:41.786 --> 38:43.586
We need to get moving.

38:45.389 --> 38:46.557
There's so much blood.

38:46.657 --> 38:47.892
Well, clean it up.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.060
With what?

38:49.159 --> 38:51.061
Do I have
to do everything?

38:55.532 --> 38:57.601
Do you know why they call
the internet the web?

38:57.701 --> 39:00.737
Because it's spun by
spiders like you, Steve.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.873
- You're a crazy
bitch, you know that?

39:04.474 --> 39:06.811
- Do you know how many
hits Steve gets a month?

39:06.911 --> 39:07.945
Yeah.

39:08.045 --> 39:09.480
- Don't you fucking
talk to her, man!

39:10.480 --> 39:12.882
Six million hits.

39:13.949 --> 39:16.019
Did you ever read
Charlotte's Web, Steve?

39:16.119 --> 39:17.887
- Who the fuck cares
about Charlotte's Web?

39:17.987 --> 39:20.490
It's a children's novel.

39:20.590 --> 39:24.894
In it the spider, Charlotte,
writes messages in her web,

39:26.096 --> 39:28.998
which ends up saving
the pig's life.

39:30.032 --> 39:33.436
Ah, that's wonderful.

39:37.440 --> 39:40.443
You need to start
to listen to me.

39:40.543 --> 39:41.644
Do you understand me?

39:41.744 --> 39:43.947
Because I am the spider now,

39:44.047 --> 39:45.815
and I will write those
messages about you

39:45.916 --> 39:47.651
for the world to
see, do you hear me?

39:57.728 --> 39:58.596
Sam, start the car.

39:58.695 --> 39:59.429
Drive.

39:59.530 --> 40:00.531
Where are we going?

40:00.630 --> 40:01.632
Deeper.

40:01.731 --> 40:02.766
Deeper?

40:02.867 --> 40:04.802
Where the fuck are
you thinking...

40:43.940 --> 40:44.775
Beth?

40:44.875 --> 40:45.842
Beth!

40:45.943 --> 40:46.677
People.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.479
Hikers or something.

40:48.579 --> 40:50.714
Go around.

40:57.721 --> 40:59.989
Motherfucker!

41:03.561 --> 41:05.129
Shit, Beth!

41:07.030 --> 41:08.865
Beth! Beth!

41:14.271 --> 41:16.606
Hey.

41:16.706 --> 41:18.041
Are you okay?

41:18.141 --> 41:19.676
Yeah. What's up?

41:19.777 --> 41:21.744
Your van almost hit a tree.

41:21.844 --> 41:23.213
Oh, yeah.

41:23.313 --> 41:24.781
Hit a sharp rock or
something back there.

41:24.882 --> 41:26.250
I think I blew a tire.

41:26.349 --> 41:27.717
Mark.

41:27.818 --> 41:29.086
Do you remember that
conversation we had earlier?

41:29.186 --> 41:31.889
If you wanna live and you
want these hikers to live,

41:31.989 --> 41:37.961
you'll close your eyes, and
you think happy thoughts.

41:49.905 --> 41:51.741
Shut up!

41:56.012 --> 41:57.114
Well, you need a hand?

41:57.213 --> 41:58.014
It's fine.

41:58.114 --> 41:59.250
Thanks though.

41:59.349 --> 42:00.918
- Yeah, have you seen
anyone else out here?

42:01.018 --> 42:02.286
No, nothing.

42:03.253 --> 42:04.722
You got everything you need?

42:04.822 --> 42:05.923
Spare tire?

42:06.023 --> 42:07.958
Yeah. Should be good.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.195
Oh, you're not alone.

42:11.295 --> 42:12.530
Hey.

42:12.630 --> 42:13.998
No, she's in good hands.

42:14.097 --> 42:15.666
Yeah, just the two of us.

42:15.766 --> 42:17.201
- You guys headed
out to Eagle Lake?

42:18.101 --> 42:19.803
Maybe.

42:19.902 --> 42:21.204
What are
you guys way out here for?

42:21.304 --> 42:23.306
Hiking? Camping?

42:23.407 --> 42:25.075
Camper van.

42:27.177 --> 42:28.612
- Is that blood
on the windshield?

42:28.711 --> 42:30.079
No, it's mud.

42:30.179 --> 42:31.548
- That's on the
inside, that's not

42:31.648 --> 42:33.083
It's mud.

42:34.918 --> 42:37.021
You guys sure you're okay?

42:38.822 --> 42:41.090
- I think maybe you
should leave now.

42:41.190 --> 42:42.225
Excuse me?

42:42.326 --> 42:43.693
- I said get the
fuck out of here.

42:43.793 --> 42:44.827
I'm sorry.

42:44.927 --> 42:45.828
Look, we're just
having a bad day.

42:45.929 --> 42:47.030
She didn't mean it.

42:47.130 --> 42:48.965
Thank you for your concern.

42:49.065 --> 42:49.832
Come on, honey.

42:49.932 --> 42:50.900
It's not worth it.

42:52.369 --> 42:55.105
No. It's not.

43:32.275 --> 43:33.309
Dude.

43:33.409 --> 43:34.210
What's going on?

43:34.311 --> 43:36.013
It's Susan.

43:36.112 --> 43:37.181
Rebecca keeps calling me.

43:37.280 --> 43:38.882
I don't know what to tell her.

43:38.981 --> 43:40.016
Call me.

43:40.117 --> 43:41.819
Call me, call me,
call me, call me.

43:52.027 --> 43:53.930
- What the fuck just
happened out there?

43:54.030 --> 43:56.967
- You idiots just got
two people killed.

43:59.735 --> 44:01.672
Are you fucking serious?

44:01.771 --> 44:02.639
You have gone too far.

44:02.739 --> 44:03.773
You have crossed a line.

44:03.873 --> 44:05.174
Hey! Are you listening to me?

44:05.275 --> 44:06.809
Shut up.

44:06.909 --> 44:08.177
Sam, you can do it.

44:08.277 --> 44:09.212
You can do it.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.146
I can't.

44:10.246 --> 44:11.014
I need you to turn around.

44:11.114 --> 44:11.814
You can do it.

44:11.914 --> 44:12.882
Sam! Sam!

44:12.983 --> 44:13.617
Don't listen to her!

44:13.717 --> 44:15.184
I told you not to talk to her.

44:15.284 --> 44:17.020
- You killed two
people in cold blood.

44:17.121 --> 44:18.055
Jesus Christ!

44:18.155 --> 44:20.923
I had no choice.

44:21.023 --> 44:22.893
Sam!

44:35.038 --> 44:35.806
Is it on?

44:35.905 --> 44:37.240
Yes, it is.

44:37.340 --> 44:38.409
Are you rolling?

44:38.509 --> 44:40.110
Yes, I think so.

44:50.820 --> 44:52.322
Put this in your mouth.

44:52.422 --> 44:54.391
Put this in your
mouth and swallow it!

45:01.498 --> 45:03.067
What are you doing?

45:03.166 --> 45:05.068
- We're gonna make
a video, boys.

45:06.469 --> 45:08.739
Are you awake in there, Steve?

45:09.438 --> 45:11.708
Now I need you to
look into the camera.

45:11.809 --> 45:13.243
I want you to tell
us your full name,

45:13.342 --> 45:14.744
and who you are.

45:16.413 --> 45:17.414
I'm Steve Coulter.

45:17.514 --> 45:18.981
Why are you doing this?

45:19.081 --> 45:20.250
No.

45:20.349 --> 45:21.951
"My name is Steve Coulter,
and I am a rapist".

45:22.052 --> 45:22.920
Say it!

45:23.019 --> 45:24.188
Fuck you!

45:24.288 --> 45:26.222
- "My name is Steve
Coulter, and I am a rapist".

45:26.322 --> 45:27.490
Say it!

45:27.590 --> 45:29.159
- My name is Steve
Coulter and I am a rapist!

45:29.259 --> 45:30.394
Yes you are, Steve.

45:31.894 --> 45:33.429
And how many girls
have you raped?

45:33.530 --> 45:35.332
- This is bullshit, I
haven't raped anyone.

45:35.431 --> 45:36.966
Wrong.

45:38.967 --> 45:41.038
How many girls?

45:41.137 --> 45:42.105
It's not rape, okay?

45:42.206 --> 45:43.273
I pay them!

45:44.239 --> 45:46.142
- And what about before
your fucking business?

45:46.242 --> 45:47.510
What about in college?

45:47.610 --> 45:49.112
You ever rape anyone when
you were in college, Steve?

45:49.213 --> 45:50.080
No!

45:50.179 --> 45:50.880
Wrong!

45:52.382 --> 45:54.150
(Steve screams.

45:56.186 --> 45:57.954
You know, I could
do this for real.

45:58.054 --> 46:01.125
Just go further and further
into the woods with you.

46:01.224 --> 46:02.291
No one knows you're out here.

46:02.391 --> 46:03.525
No one even knows
you're fucking missing!

46:03.626 --> 46:06.163
So why don't you tell me what
this feels like on your dick?

46:06.262 --> 46:07.431
I don't

46:07.530 --> 46:08.498
I don't touch the girls.

46:08.599 --> 46:09.399
I just film them.

46:09.498 --> 46:10.299
My hands are clean.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.068
Check the tapes.

46:11.168 --> 46:12.035
I have.

46:12.135 --> 46:13.170
Then get out of my face, okay?

46:13.269 --> 46:14.338
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

46:14.438 --> 46:16.173
I don't think so.

46:17.106 --> 46:21.912
- I sell videos of
consenting adults having sex.

46:22.012 --> 46:23.280
Since when is that illegal?

46:23.380 --> 46:25.883
- Have you ever used
gamma-hydroxybutyric acid?

46:25.983 --> 46:26.450
What is that?

46:26.550 --> 46:27.317
GHB.

46:27.416 --> 46:28.518
- Never!
- Ever?

46:29.452 --> 46:30.420
All right, all right!

46:30.519 --> 46:31.954
Okay, okay, yes.

46:32.054 --> 46:33.790
Maybe once.

46:35.425 --> 46:39.797
Shhh. Close the
door, close the door.

46:41.931 --> 46:42.932
What are we doing?

46:43.032 --> 46:45.067
Shut the fuck up.

46:45.168 --> 46:47.436
what do we do now?

46:47.536 --> 46:49.572
Take off her shirt.

46:52.307 --> 46:56.847
Nice and easy. There
we go, there we go.

47:01.117 --> 47:02.319
Kenny, shut the fuck up.

47:02.418 --> 47:03.119
Me?

47:03.219 --> 47:04.353
Yeah, you.

47:04.454 --> 47:05.155
Shhh.

47:05.255 --> 47:06.088
It's that voice.

47:06.188 --> 47:07.957
It's that fucking
voice behind the camera

47:08.057 --> 47:09.358
that makes it all happen.

47:09.458 --> 47:10.960
- This is entrapment
and you know it.

47:11.061 --> 47:12.095
Oh, call it whatever you want.

47:12.195 --> 47:13.997
You're fucking guilty.

47:16.465 --> 47:19.435
Here we go.
Okay, turn her over.

47:23.139 --> 47:25.175
Yeah. All right.

47:25.275 --> 47:27.543
Johnny-boy, you first.

47:27.643 --> 47:30.847
Okay, here we
go. I'll flip her over.

47:34.117 --> 47:37.554
Okay. Make it hurt.

47:38.454 --> 47:40.557
Yeah. Right.

47:40.657 --> 47:41.992
Shit.

47:43.092 --> 47:45.996
I don't keep count.

47:53.369 --> 47:55.305
- And these videos
are on your website?

47:55.405 --> 47:57.274
No.

47:59.108 --> 48:00.277
Yes!

48:00.376 --> 48:01.878
Which is it?

48:01.978 --> 48:04.480
- You can only access it if
you have a special password.

48:09.119 --> 48:12.422
- So people pay extra
to see these videos?

48:12.521 --> 48:14.324
Good boy, Steve.

48:16.193 --> 48:17.594
Mark?

48:19.295 --> 48:21.264
How you doing there, big boy?

48:22.164 --> 48:24.467
How you holding up there?

48:24.568 --> 48:28.038
Those pills I gave you,

48:29.572 --> 48:32.041
they making you
feel pretty good?

48:33.509 --> 48:37.347
What are you doing?

48:37.447 --> 48:40.083
- I have you a male
enhancement drug.

48:40.182 --> 48:42.184
What? Why?

48:43.987 --> 48:46.590
There you are.

48:46.690 --> 48:48.592
Do you like me Mark?

48:48.692 --> 48:51.027
Or is that just a
banana in your pants?

48:51.128 --> 48:52.329
- I have nothing to
do with this, okay?

48:52.429 --> 48:54.932
I have nothing to do with this!

48:55.764 --> 48:57.134
I know.

48:58.101 --> 48:59.936
I know, but John's dead,

49:00.036 --> 49:02.038
so I need you to stand
in for him, okay?

49:04.106 --> 49:05.574
Stop it.

49:08.210 --> 49:10.346
You do not tell me what to do,

49:10.447 --> 49:13.050
do you understand me?

49:14.016 --> 49:15.384
Augh!

49:17.085 --> 49:19.689
- Steve, I want you to feel
what one in six women feels

49:19.789 --> 49:22.224
every year.

49:25.362 --> 49:26.630
I've given you all you want.

49:26.730 --> 49:28.498
What more do you need from me?

49:28.597 --> 49:31.400
- I don't need any more
information from you, shit head,

49:31.501 --> 49:34.004
but I will take something else.

49:35.103 --> 49:36.572
Smile for the camera.

49:36.672 --> 49:38.307
What?

49:38.407 --> 49:40.610
- Doing all right
over there, babe?

49:42.512 --> 49:45.749
Remind me, how does
it start again?

49:46.681 --> 49:49.185
Say "hi, daddy"?

49:53.655 --> 49:54.523
Say it!

49:54.623 --> 49:56.392
Hi, daddy!

49:57.460 --> 49:59.096
- You know, it feels
like something's missing.

49:59.195 --> 50:01.530
You need something
in your mouth.

50:05.635 --> 50:07.237
I want you to look in the camera

50:07.336 --> 50:09.139
and I want you to tell us
that you're full of shit.

50:11.775 --> 50:13.744
- And tell us how
worthless you are.

50:17.114 --> 50:18.715
Yes, you are.

50:27.789 --> 50:29.092
You're up, Mark.

50:29.192 --> 50:30.726
Time to shine.

50:30.827 --> 50:32.129
What are you...

50:32.829 --> 50:34.331
What the fuck?

50:36.164 --> 50:37.666
Put it in his mouth.

50:37.766 --> 50:38.634
What?

50:38.735 --> 50:39.603
What?

50:39.702 --> 50:40.637
No fucking way!

50:40.737 --> 50:42.072
Yeah, no fucking way!

50:42.172 --> 50:44.307
- Put it in his mouth
or it's a fucking gun.

50:44.407 --> 50:45.442
If you put that near my mouth,

50:45.541 --> 50:47.576
I'll fucking bite it right off.

50:47.677 --> 50:49.312
- Mark, if you ever want to
see your fucking wife again,

50:49.411 --> 50:51.047
you're gonna do it,
you understand me?

50:51.148 --> 50:52.048
I can't
fucking do this.

50:52.148 --> 50:52.815
Do it!

50:52.916 --> 50:54.217
Fucking can't fucking do this!

50:54.317 --> 50:56.619
Fine!

50:56.719 --> 50:58.254
You don't want him to
put it in your mouth?

50:58.355 --> 51:00.322
This is the only reason
you're still alive.

51:03.226 --> 51:05.262
Pull his pants down.

51:05.362 --> 51:07.197
He can't bite you with this.

51:07.297 --> 51:09.099
Don't do.

51:09.199 --> 51:09.833
Don't do it!

51:09.932 --> 51:11.333
Do it!

51:11.434 --> 51:12.769
No! No!

51:12.869 --> 51:13.804
If you ever want to
see your fucking kid again,

51:13.903 --> 51:14.670
do it!

51:14.771 --> 51:15.505
No...

51:15.605 --> 51:17.641
Do it!

51:17.740 --> 51:20.610
Shut up! Shut up!

51:20.710 --> 51:21.845
Do you want to see your baby?

51:22.679 --> 51:24.748
Do it! Do it!

51:27.282 --> 51:33.282
Shut up! Do it!

52:14.563 --> 52:15.397
Don't move!

52:15.498 --> 52:17.367
On the ground!

52:18.634 --> 52:19.869
She was holding us hostage!

52:19.969 --> 52:21.904
Don't talk, don't move.

52:34.416 --> 52:35.251
Hey, hey!

52:35.351 --> 52:37.186
Behind the van, arms up!

52:37.286 --> 52:38.654
Let's go!

52:38.755 --> 52:39.556
I'm not armed.

52:39.655 --> 52:41.391
I don't have a weapon, okay?

52:41.490 --> 52:43.425
On the ground! On the ground!

52:59.242 --> 53:00.577
All right.

53:00.677 --> 53:01.912
Now tell me what the
hell is going on here.

53:02.012 --> 53:03.380
- She fucking took
us hostage, man.

53:03.480 --> 53:04.713
That's what the
hell's going on here.

53:04.813 --> 53:05.648
Can you get us out of here?

53:05.748 --> 53:07.650
Are you by yourself?

53:07.751 --> 53:08.485
Yeah.

53:08.585 --> 53:10.452
Does that van work?

53:10.552 --> 53:11.788
I don't know. Yeah?

53:13.489 --> 53:15.458
She one of them?

53:15.557 --> 53:16.358
I don't know.

53:16.458 --> 53:17.359
I don't fucking know, man.

53:17.460 --> 53:18.595
Let's just get the fuck
out of here right now.

53:18.695 --> 53:19.863
Hey, hey,

53:19.963 --> 53:20.697
we don't get your
boyfriend to the hospital,

53:20.797 --> 53:26.269
he's dead, all right?

53:30.672 --> 53:32.208
Take this.

53:34.610 --> 53:36.246
Keep your eye on this one.

53:36.346 --> 53:37.547
I shot her in the shoulder.

53:37.646 --> 53:39.615
She's in shock.

53:39.715 --> 53:40.916
She's still breathing.

54:00.536 --> 54:02.239
Jesus.

54:02.938 --> 54:05.008
- Do you have a cell phone
or a radio or something?

54:05.108 --> 54:07.477
We need to call like backup.

54:09.545 --> 54:13.650
Tell me you have a
fucking radio, man.

55:09.438 --> 55:11.807
Please, please

55:11.907 --> 55:13.876
tell me you have a phone.

55:15.510 --> 55:16.445
Oh my god.

55:41.804 --> 55:43.907
Susan.

55:51.746 --> 55:52.748
Come on, come on,

55:52.849 --> 55:54.484
give me a signal, come on!

57:17.766 --> 57:19.601
Hello?

57:19.702 --> 57:20.203
Hello!

57:20.302 --> 57:21.804
Mark?

57:21.905 --> 57:24.574
Hello? Hello, can you hear me?

57:24.673 --> 57:26.208
Mark? What?

57:27.108 --> 57:29.011
- Come on, I've
got a fucking bar.

57:29.112 --> 57:30.180
Hello!

57:30.280 --> 57:31.181
- I can barely hear
you, where are you?

57:34.916 --> 57:36.719
What?

57:36.818 --> 57:37.653
Hello?

57:37.753 --> 57:39.755
Mark!

57:39.856 --> 57:41.991
Mark, you're breaking up.

57:42.090 --> 57:44.159
Oh, shit.

57:51.934 --> 57:53.536
Fuck.

58:01.210 --> 58:03.012
Stay with the van!

58:53.061 --> 58:56.298
You got me pretty good.

58:56.398 --> 58:59.536
You shoulda moved on.

59:03.706 --> 59:06.543
I think I'm bleeding out.

59:07.710 --> 59:10.213
Well you were helping
the wrong people.

59:12.715 --> 59:14.918
I made a choice.

59:16.351 --> 59:19.221
You can't go through
life pretending

59:19.322 --> 59:21.990
you don't see what's right
in front of your eyes.

59:24.760 --> 59:26.896
It's no way to live.

59:29.331 --> 59:31.968
It's no way to die either.

59:33.835 --> 59:35.771
- Living, knowing
I never even tried

59:35.871 --> 59:37.306
would have been worse.

59:37.407 --> 59:39.642
Those are bad men.

59:39.742 --> 59:41.244
And they're getting
what they deserve.

59:41.344 --> 59:43.246
No.

59:43.346 --> 59:45.847
Nobody deserves that.

59:46.949 --> 59:49.918
That's exactly my point.

59:51.420 --> 59:54.824
I was only trying to help.

59:59.762 --> 01:00:03.266
Fuck!

01:00:07.402 --> 01:00:09.271
My name is Mark Tallion, okay?

01:00:09.371 --> 01:00:10.940
I've been taken hostage.

01:00:11.039 --> 01:00:12.976
Can you hear me?

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:13.842
Hello!

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:14.744
I don't know.

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:15.711
I'm in the woods somewhere.

01:00:15.811 --> 01:00:16.778
I think I'm east of the city.

01:00:16.878 --> 01:00:18.280
People have been hurt.

01:00:19.715 --> 01:00:20.850
Landmarks?

01:00:20.949 --> 01:00:22.018
We need, we need help!

01:00:22.117 --> 01:00:22.918
We need backup!

01:00:23.018 --> 01:00:23.819
I don't fucking know.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.921
Just.

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:25.822
No, I'm in the
middle of nowhere.

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:27.056
She killed two hikers.

01:00:27.155 --> 01:00:28.724
Another guy came
out of the woods.

01:00:28.824 --> 01:00:30.359
Get someone out here!
Hello?

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:33.896
Hold on.

01:00:37.932 --> 01:00:39.735
Hello?

01:00:39.835 --> 01:00:41.203
Fuck. Hello?

01:00:45.239 --> 01:00:46.642
Come on!

01:01:33.121 --> 01:01:36.259
Come here, bitch!

01:01:40.228 --> 01:01:43.699
Yeah, you skanks
are all the same.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.702
Stupid and weak.

01:01:50.838 --> 01:01:53.742
Yeah. Tell me how it feels.

01:02:15.496 --> 01:02:17.299
The fuck?

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.869
You like that?

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:22.338
You wanna rough me up?

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:23.940
Hurt me?

01:02:26.307 --> 01:02:28.210
Fuck me?

01:02:41.222 --> 01:02:43.425
What the fuck was that?

01:02:43.525 --> 01:02:44.393
He attacked me.

01:02:44.492 --> 01:02:46.828
He was trying to kill me.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.297
So you decided to fuck him?

01:02:48.396 --> 01:02:49.297
Beth, calm down.

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:50.399
I had no choice!

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.936
Are you playing me?

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:56.172
I thought you understood
what we were doing out here.

01:02:56.271 --> 01:02:59.040
I do understand.

01:02:59.141 --> 01:03:01.344
- Well it sure as fuck
doesn't look like it!

01:03:01.443 --> 01:03:03.112
You weren't here, Beth.

01:03:03.211 --> 01:03:04.146
He was on top of me.

01:03:04.246 --> 01:03:06.449
What was I supposed to do?

01:03:06.548 --> 01:03:07.416
I don't know?

01:03:07.516 --> 01:03:09.786
Maybe keep your pants on!

01:03:09.885 --> 01:03:12.121
I needed you.

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:14.222
You weren't here.

01:03:15.257 --> 01:03:17.226
I can't do this all by myself.

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:18.994
I had to go after him.

01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:23.431
Where's Mark?

01:03:23.532 --> 01:03:25.802
He's gone.

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:26.802
What do you mean.

01:03:26.902 --> 01:03:28.270
I lost him.

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:30.807
He's a journalist!

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:32.575
Yeah, well I don't
know where he went, Sam.

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:34.877
Maybe if you had
been helping me,

01:03:34.976 --> 01:03:37.279
instead of fucking that
sleezebag in the van,

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.148
then we would be on track still!

01:03:40.248 --> 01:03:43.084
- You brought us out
into buttfuck nowhere.

01:03:43.184 --> 01:03:45.221
It's not my fault Grizzly
Adams happened to be

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.589
out here hunting deer
and saving people!

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.492
Your plan has gone to shit.

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:51.860
We need to get out of here.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.228
We're almost done.

01:04:04.639 --> 01:04:06.608
You fucking bitch.

01:04:54.956 --> 01:04:57.492
I really thought she
was gonna kill you.

01:05:01.028 --> 01:05:05.501
I need some water.

01:05:09.704 --> 01:05:12.007
Where you going, hot shot?

01:05:15.543 --> 01:05:18.114
It's over.

01:05:18.213 --> 01:05:20.449
Let's get out of here.

01:05:20.548 --> 01:05:26.389
Not that easy.

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:32.961
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

01:05:33.061 --> 01:05:34.130
You know how hard it was

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:35.965
to find someone like her?

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:40.001
Damaged, vulnerable,
yet strong, angry?

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:46.943
You found her?

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:48.277
Bingo.

01:05:54.282 --> 01:05:55.518
Hey. It's me.

01:05:55.617 --> 01:05:56.686
It's almost done.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.554
See you soon.

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:36.391
I've met you before, you know.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:39.662
That's why you recognized me.

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:41.497
It was back in college.

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:44.133
Kappa Sigma Phi party.

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:46.268
Bunch of people were
about to graduate.

01:06:48.202 --> 01:06:50.672
I was barely out of high school.

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:54.744
I remember, I was
having such a good time.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.412
I was there with my girlfriends,

01:06:56.512 --> 01:07:00.349
and Jonathan talking
to me all evening.

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:03.485
I thought he was cute.

01:07:03.585 --> 01:07:07.322
I probably would
have slept with him.

01:07:07.422 --> 01:07:10.425
I remember thinking that.

01:07:10.525 --> 01:07:12.594
You told him to give me a drink.

01:07:15.563 --> 01:07:17.365
I remember that.

01:07:18.766 --> 01:07:22.437
I remember John
giving me a drink,

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:26.742
and that's it.

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:29.311
Nothing else.

01:08:02.443 --> 01:08:05.213
The next thing I
remember is waking up

01:08:05.313 --> 01:08:06.481
sore all over.

01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:07.782
Everything hurt.

01:08:07.882 --> 01:08:10.385
I was in a room I didn't know.

01:08:11.753 --> 01:08:16.390
I went home that day
sick and I cried.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:22.096
I didn't know why,

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.667
but I cried all day.

01:08:24.765 --> 01:08:28.804
I just felt like
something was wrong.

01:08:31.238 --> 01:08:33.375
I had no idea.

01:08:42.515 --> 01:08:44.685
Make it hurt.

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:49.625
- Three days later
is when I first heard

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.460
about the tape.

01:08:53.528 --> 01:08:55.865
It was going around campus,

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.667
spreading like wildfire,

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:05.541
and you guys had already
moved on to the next girl,

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.741
and the next

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:09.144
and the next, and the next...

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:14.383
I moved on with my life,

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:16.216
much as I could.

01:09:17.551 --> 01:09:19.487
Went to a lot of therapy,

01:09:20.453 --> 01:09:23.192
blamed myself a lot.

01:09:24.225 --> 01:09:26.327
I drank too much.

01:09:26.426 --> 01:09:28.229
I let it happen.

01:09:29.395 --> 01:09:31.832
Then I heard you guys
had started a company,

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:33.269
and there you were,

01:09:33.368 --> 01:09:36.304
just going on with your life.

01:09:38.805 --> 01:09:41.309
That drove me mad.

01:09:41.408 --> 01:09:43.310
I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:45.314
I couldn't sleep,

01:09:45.412 --> 01:09:46.680
knowing you were out there,

01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:48.751
abusing women, getting paid,

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:51.353
laughing about it
to your buddies.

01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:55.691
That's when I met Beth.

01:09:56.925 --> 01:09:59.628
Did you know it's more likely

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:02.530
for a woman in the military
to be sexually assaulted

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.867
than killed in combat?

01:10:06.734 --> 01:10:07.869
Yeah.

01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:13.342
Anyway, she
understood how I felt.

01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:17.246
She wanted to make
it right for me,

01:10:17.345 --> 01:10:18.446
for her,

01:10:19.447 --> 01:10:21.750
and you were such
an easy target.

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:22.918
God!

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:24.353
You had your head so
far up your own ass,

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:28.356
putting yourself out
in the open every day

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:31.794
making your sick
little X-Bus videos,

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:35.364
and well, here we are.

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:39.401
I know, I know.

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:42.438
You're sick of hearing me talk.

01:10:42.537 --> 01:10:44.239
You're tired.

01:10:45.539 --> 01:10:48.777
You just want this
all to be over now,

01:10:50.612 --> 01:10:54.449
but I put a lot of
thought into this, Steve.

01:10:58.653 --> 01:11:00.956
Especially this next part.

01:11:01.922 --> 01:11:04.827
Thought for hours about what is

01:11:04.926 --> 01:11:08.329
the most important
thing to a man.

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:15.471
To you, your most
prized possession.

01:11:24.011 --> 01:11:28.549
Watching you confess,
suffer, and beg

01:11:29.617 --> 01:11:33.021
was the most satisfying
moment of my life.

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:40.729
You what?

01:11:40.828 --> 01:11:43.331
Make it hurt.

01:12:26.841 --> 01:12:29.578
Press it.

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:43.625
Help me!

01:12:50.626 --> 01:12:56.626
