No, I don't. Quick question:

How many Twitter followers did
you have before the TED Talk?

02:58.027 --> 02:59.160

No, Clyde, the pressures of fame are many.

- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, sure, a lot of people enjoyed the content

03:20.550 --> 03:22.650

also took off my shirt.

03:22.685 --> 03:24.619
So... secret's out.

03:24.654 --> 03:27.021
Tess understands that I'm a
lot of women's hall pass now.

03:27.056 --> 03:29.523
(A): It was completely unnecessary for you

03:29.559 --> 03:31.325
- to go shirtless in your TED Talk.
- Oh, I disagree.

03:31.361 --> 03:33.494
(And B): You're telling me that
Tess went up to you and said,

03:33.529 --> 03:35.196
"I know that women are
gonna want to fuck you now"?

03:35.231 --> 03:36.430
Those were her exact words to you?

03:36.466 --> 03:38.232
Well, no. I haven't actually had a chance

03:38.268 --> 03:40.134
to speak with her since the TED Talk.

waffles or did you do both?

- It was fine.
- [Clyde] Ah.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.926

little bit nervous about

04:05.962 --> 04:07.128
you and Seth getting together.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.996
Really? I hadn't picked up on that.

04:09.032 --> 04:10.898
But I'm clearly out of
touch with the electorate,

04:10.933 --> 04:14.001

been really responding to you

bands are poison to my ears,

07:41.010 --> 07:43.911
Can we please have two of those right away?

07:43.946 --> 07:45.513
Thank you.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.014
So what's up, pimpin'?

07:47.049 --> 07:49.216
Hear you, uh, are gonna go solo?

07:49.252 --> 07:51.652
- Mm-hmm.
- Dope.

07:51.687 --> 07:54.088
Look, I'll, um, I'll have a drink with you,

07:54.123 --> 07:56.056
but let's-let's skip the whole thing

07:56.092 --> 07:58.058
where you try to talk me into re-signing.

07:58.094 --> 07:59.193
Shit.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.561
I had this whole audio/visual

08:00.596 --> 08:02.396
presentation set up, too:

08:02.431 --> 08:03.797
I was gonna have graphs and fireworks

08:03.833 --> 08:05.566
- and dancing girls and shit, it was gonna be awesome.
- [laughs]

08:05.601 --> 08:06.901
You know what, Kori?

08:06.936 --> 08:08.102
Let's just kill the PowerPoint.

08:08.137 --> 08:10.004
So... what?

08:10.039 --> 08:12.406
You're seriously not gonna
try to convince me to re-sign?

08:12.441 --> 08:13.807
Sounds like you already
made up your mind, right?

08:13.843 --> 08:14.975
Fuck it.

08:15.011 --> 08:15.976
Oh, here we go.

08:16.012 --> 08:18.178
Okay, so what do you want to drink to?

08:18.214 --> 08:20.447
Uh... No, I got it.

08:20.483 --> 08:21.949
We will drink to

08:21.984 --> 08:24.151
your last two weeks of financial security.

08:24.186 --> 08:25.753
What? What-what are you talking about?

08:25.788 --> 08:26.787
Oh, my God, that's delicious.

08:26.822 --> 08:28.455
Well, I looked at your financials.

08:28.491 --> 08:29.990
Mm. And...

08:30.026 --> 08:30.991
[chuckles]

08:31.027 --> 08:31.992
Shit.

08:32.028 --> 08:34.461
I'm not gonna try to sell you.

08:34.496 --> 08:35.462
Forget it.

08:35.498 --> 08:37.364
Y-You're... you're doing great.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.134
I mean, you're gonna be Justin Timberlake.

08:40.169 --> 08:42.503
Fuck it, you're gonna be
bigger than Justin Timberlake.

08:42.538 --> 08:43.837
But you know what I am gonna do?

08:43.873 --> 08:45.306
I'm gonna go work on my jumper.

08:45.341 --> 08:47.074
You got this, right, playboy?

08:47.109 --> 08:49.009
Sure. Okay.

08:49.045 --> 08:50.344
Damn, girl, why you dressed like

08:50.379 --> 08:52.046
we're at a business meeting or something?

08:52.081 --> 08:54.014
Oh. Because we're at a business meeting.

08:54.050 --> 08:55.816
Yeah, you need some bling.

08:55.851 --> 08:58.085
I'm gonna win you a necklace.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.320
You don't have to w...

08:59.355 --> 09:01.021
[girls clamoring] Okay.

09:01.057 --> 09:02.556
You know, I don't think I
could do what you're doing.

09:02.592 --> 09:03.991
Risking it all.

09:04.026 --> 09:05.859
It's like we sing in the
song "Follow Your Heart."

09:05.895 --> 09:07.494
You've go to follow your heart.

09:07.530 --> 09:08.929
- Oh, those are the lyrics.
- Oh, is that what it means?

09:08.965 --> 09:10.864
Plus, D'ream Out Loud
can be a drag sometimes.

09:10.900 --> 09:12.800
Yeah. I mean, having millions of dollars

09:12.835 --> 09:14.001
and an endless supply of women

09:14.036 --> 09:15.035
sounds like a real nightmare.

09:15.071 --> 09:16.670
Conner gets paid more than us.

09:16.706 --> 09:18.672
We should be getting equal pay,

09:18.708 --> 09:20.507
closing that wage gap and shit.

09:20.543 --> 09:22.776
Ooh! Eat it, bitch!

09:22.812 --> 09:24.645
- The hell was that, Clyde?
- Are you serious?

09:24.680 --> 09:25.646
Gotta get your head in the game.

09:25.681 --> 09:26.680
You're on defense.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.118
Yo.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.453
So, uh...

09:32.488 --> 09:34.054
my business manager says I'm set.

09:34.090 --> 09:35.589
Oh, word? Yeah, word. Word.

09:35.625 --> 09:36.924
Cool.

09:36.959 --> 09:39.259
Yeah. Says even if I never
sell a single solo album,

09:39.295 --> 09:40.961
which is, like, basically impossible,

09:40.997 --> 09:43.998
Joel assures me I have enough
money to last two lifetimes.

09:44.033 --> 09:45.432
Oh, Joel assured you. Yeah.

09:45.468 --> 09:47.701
Well, I'm sure he has your
best interests at heart.

09:47.737 --> 09:49.169
I mean... [laughs]

09:49.205 --> 09:51.038
he is a business manager in
the music industry, after all.

09:51.073 --> 09:53.240
[laughing]

09:53.275 --> 09:54.742
I knew you were
bullshitting me before, man.

09:54.777 --> 09:56.176
- What, what?
- You're trying to scare me.

09:56.212 --> 09:57.244
That's what you're trying to do.

09:57.279 --> 09:59.146
Yeah, I'm the boogeyman.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.315
Let me tell you what the
boogeyman sees, Conner.

10:01.350 --> 10:04.918
A kid who is spending $650,000 a month

10:04.954 --> 10:06.320
on expenses...

10:06.355 --> 10:07.755
That's a huge fucking nut, buddy.

10:07.790 --> 10:09.356
Well, I have investments.

10:09.392 --> 10:11.392
Yeah, like your $11 million dollar house

10:11.427 --> 10:13.927
that you bought at the height
of the real estate bubble?

10:13.963 --> 10:15.262
[scoffs]

10:15.297 --> 10:16.263
We'll see.

10:16.298 --> 10:17.331
Next time you talk to Joel,

10:17.366 --> 10:19.733
ask him about his private offshore account,

10:19.769 --> 10:22.936
how it just keeps mysteriously growing.

10:22.972 --> 10:24.772
My guess is that

10:24.807 --> 10:27.474
he isn't paying your taxes.

10:27.510 --> 10:28.676
Let me see... you also have

10:28.711 --> 10:30.277
a six-month
non-compete clause,

10:30.312 --> 10:31.445
if you don't re-sign.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.213
[sighs] I don't know, man.

10:33.249 --> 10:35.115
Think your fans are gonna wait that long?

10:35.151 --> 10:38.252
I mean, teenage girls have
the attention span of...

10:38.287 --> 10:39.586
well, a teenage girl.

10:39.622 --> 10:41.789
But, hey!

10:41.824 --> 10:43.290
You are Conner Sanders,

10:43.325 --> 10:45.192
lead singer of D'ream Out Loud,

10:45.227 --> 10:46.760
king of the fuckin' world.

10:47.763 --> 10:49.063
Nothing scares you, right?

10:50.099 --> 10:52.132
- [Girl] Conner...
- [Girl 2] I love you!

10:52.168 --> 10:53.701
[Girl 3] Hey, Conner!

10:53.736 --> 10:54.702
Boo! [inhales sharply]

10:54.737 --> 10:56.637
[Girl 3] Over here!

10:56.672 --> 10:58.906
All right, well, after she falls asleep,

10:58.941 --> 11:01.308
will you wash the rest of the bottles?

11:01.343 --> 11:02.376
Yeah.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.011
Okay, thank you.

11:06.782 --> 11:09.083
Oh, my God, you actually won it.

11:09.118 --> 11:10.417
[chuckles] How?

11:10.453 --> 11:12.419
Yo, that claw machine is hella hard,

11:12.455 --> 11:13.987
but I got it on the 15th try.

11:14.023 --> 11:15.489
That's a personal best, all right?

11:15.524 --> 11:17.224
Well, if you stay in the band,

11:17.259 --> 11:19.093
you'll keep being able to
spend hundreds of dollars

11:19.128 --> 11:20.627
on claw machine necklaces.

11:20.663 --> 11:21.762
It's not about the money.

11:21.797 --> 11:24.064
Everyone says it's not about the money

11:24.100 --> 11:25.566
until they don't have the money.

11:30.005 --> 11:31.638
Thank you.

11:31.674 --> 11:34.675
You know, honestly, I never even
wanted to be in D'ream Out Loud.

11:34.710 --> 11:36.443
Conner convinced me it was
gonna be cool, you know,

11:36.479 --> 11:37.978
and then I-I made him swear

11:38.013 --> 11:40.247
that we were always
gonna be tight and then...

11:40.282 --> 11:41.949
Conner went full asshole.

11:41.984 --> 11:44.785
But that does not change the fact

11:44.820 --> 11:47.521
that you are in <i>the</i>
most successful boy band

11:47.556 --> 11:48.589
on the planet,

11:48.624 --> 11:50.457
and that is a lot to walk away from.

11:50.493 --> 11:53.193
What's the point of being rich
and famous if I'm not happy?

11:54.530 --> 11:55.763
Feel me?

11:57.366 --> 11:58.532
Yeah.

11:58.567 --> 11:59.833
I feel you.

11:59.869 --> 12:01.702
[phone buzzing, chiming]

12:01.737 --> 12:03.504
Whoa, damn, your shit's blowing up.

12:03.539 --> 12:05.005
Sorry. Just let me...

12:05.040 --> 12:06.006
No, no, no, it's good.

12:06.041 --> 12:07.441
What the fuck?

12:07.476 --> 12:09.543
- [girl] Look over...
- [girl 2] Hi!

12:09.578 --> 12:12.613
[Seth] <i>I see the struggles of
Angelenos every single day.</i>

12:12.648 --> 12:14.982
<i>I myself am currently dating
a single mother... Jeannie...</i>

12:15.017 --> 12:17.284
<i>but she works incredibly hard</i>

12:17.319 --> 12:18.786
<i>to put food on the table
for her infant daughter.</i>

12:18.821 --> 12:20.120
<i>Some days, she's
even out of the house</i>

12:20.156 --> 12:21.789
<i>before her baby wakes up.</i>

12:21.824 --> 12:24.658
<i>By the time she's back home,
her baby's already asleep.</i>

12:24.693 --> 12:26.660
<i>Watching her face these challenges,</i>

12:26.695 --> 12:27.995
<i>it reminds me every single day</i>

12:28.030 --> 12:29.663
<i>how this great city
is full of heroes</i>

12:29.698 --> 12:30.697
<i>just like Jeannie.</i>

12:30.733 --> 12:32.366
<i>So the question voters will...</i>

12:32.401 --> 12:34.535
What the fuck was that?

12:34.570 --> 12:35.869
I'm sorry, am I...

12:35.905 --> 12:38.472
am I some sort of crazy
crack whore charity case?

12:38.507 --> 12:40.174
Shit, that dude's your boyfriend?

12:40.209 --> 12:41.942
Yeah. Oh, total douche move.

12:41.977 --> 12:44.578
I thought we were casually
dating, but apparently, to him,

12:44.613 --> 12:46.780
I'm the poster child for single motherhood.

12:46.816 --> 12:48.015
And I'm co-parenting,

12:48.050 --> 12:49.149
by the way. Yeah.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.684
Not to mention, you
know he expects me to go

12:50.719 --> 12:52.152
to every single one of
these fucking events.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.388
Showing up and smiling
when you don't feel like it.

12:54.423 --> 12:58.258
Being a part of-of some
story that you didn't write.

12:58.294 --> 13:00.294
I know exactly what you're talking about.

13:01.497 --> 13:03.530
I would never do that to you.

13:03.566 --> 13:05.365
I'd treat you like a queen.

13:09.338 --> 13:10.871
- Mm, no tongue. I... no.
- No?

13:10.906 --> 13:12.673
Ahem. Jeannie.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.174
Marty wants to talk.

13:15.611 --> 13:17.211
[whistling airlessly]

13:17.246 --> 13:18.579
Shut up, Doug.

13:23.319 --> 13:25.219
Guys, why do we have to
be in the women's room?

13:25.254 --> 13:26.920
So the boys can't get in.

13:26.956 --> 13:28.689
Ah, I'm so sorry, you
gotta get out of here.

13:28.724 --> 13:29.957
- I'm building something.
- [woman] I have to go!

13:29.992 --> 13:31.525
Okay, I think I got Conner.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.460
- I'm just gonna have to give him a push.
- [Doug] Mm-hmm.

13:33.495 --> 13:35.128
So where you at with your guys?

13:35.164 --> 13:36.363
Uh, Hunter and Ryder want parity.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.365
- I guess we can make that work.
- [Jeannie] Sadly,

13:38.400 --> 13:41.201
Sam thinks Conner is the
biggest asshole on the planet

13:41.237 --> 13:43.036
and he's dead set on leaving the band.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.872
Do these guys not realize

13:44.907 --> 13:46.607
that they are nothing but very lucky,

13:46.642 --> 13:48.542
glorified fucking backup dancers?

13:48.577 --> 13:50.110
Look, I think if we can get

13:50.145 --> 13:51.945
Conner to agree to
parity, then we have three.

13:51.981 --> 13:53.547
- [Doug] Yeah.
- I think we can sell that to CMG.

13:53.582 --> 13:54.781
Fuck that.

13:54.817 --> 13:56.316
Look out.

13:56.352 --> 13:57.851
Or we could fuck that.

13:57.887 --> 13:59.186
I guess we're gonna fuck that.

13:59.221 --> 14:01.555
[sighs, scoffs]

14:01.590 --> 14:03.590
- [game engine revving]
- [Marty] I'm with Conner.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.328
Junior.

14:08.364 --> 14:09.663
Need to talk to you for a second.

14:09.698 --> 14:10.664
[sighs] You already
fucked with my head enough.

14:10.699 --> 14:11.698
Can you leave me alone?

14:11.734 --> 14:12.966
I think you're gonna want to hear this,

14:13.002 --> 14:15.669
unless, of course, you
don't want to go solo.

14:15.704 --> 14:17.905
- [girls clamoring in distance]
- [girl] Conner! Conner!

14:17.940 --> 14:20.007
[cars crashing on video game]

14:20.042 --> 14:21.108
- [phone buzzing]
- [Clyde] Seth is calling.

14:21.143 --> 14:22.442
You gonna pick it up?

14:22.478 --> 14:23.911
No.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.313
No? You have 11 missed calls.

14:26.348 --> 14:27.848
- You have to fuckin' talk to him.
- [sighs]

14:27.883 --> 14:28.949
Do I, Clyde?

14:28.984 --> 14:30.384
- Yes, you do, Jeannie.
- [phone ringing]

14:30.419 --> 14:31.952
Yes, you do.

14:31.987 --> 14:33.553
Hey, Seth, what's going on?

14:33.589 --> 14:34.855
Yeah. She's right here.

14:34.890 --> 14:36.189
I don't know.

14:36.225 --> 14:37.190
Must be broken.

14:37.226 --> 14:38.425
Phone for you, Jeannie.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.296
Are you fucking serious?

14:42.331 --> 14:43.664
Sorry, I'm such a butterfingers.

14:43.699 --> 14:45.933
- [boys laughing]
- What the fuck is wrong with you, Jeannie?

14:45.968 --> 14:46.967
Are you ghosting him?

14:47.002 --> 14:48.635
I might be.

14:48.671 --> 14:50.304
Tell me what it is and
I'll tell you if I am.

14:50.339 --> 14:51.538
It's when you break up with somebody

14:51.573 --> 14:52.873
just by never talking to them again.

14:52.908 --> 14:54.675
It's cold as shit.

14:54.710 --> 14:56.476
It's what Charlize did to Sean Penn.

14:56.512 --> 14:57.978
[Ryder] I mean, she was all,

14:58.013 --> 14:59.279
"I'm a ghost, bitch."

14:59.315 --> 15:01.581
Hey, do you have any dry rice?

15:01.617 --> 15:04.618
No, but we have spicy Thai peanut noodles.

15:04.653 --> 15:05.819
No, I... Nope, I don't...

15:05.854 --> 15:07.154
Nope, I don't want that.

15:07.189 --> 15:08.789
How long do you... do you,
do you not talk to someone

15:08.824 --> 15:09.790
before it's ghosting?

15:09.825 --> 15:10.891
I'd say, like,

15:10.926 --> 15:12.159
- five, maybe six days.
- Yeah.

15:12.194 --> 15:14.227
- That's cool. Yeah. That's cool.
- Douglas...

15:14.263 --> 15:15.896
- Hmm?
- How long has it been since your last Tess Talk?

15:15.931 --> 15:17.531
Eight-eight days.

15:17.566 --> 15:18.532
- You're being ghosted.
- You been ghosted.

15:18.567 --> 15:19.333
- Yeah. - [Sam] For sure.
- Boo, man.

15:19.368 --> 15:21.001
Damn it.

15:21.036 --> 15:22.102
Yo. I'm, uh, I'm taking off.

15:22.137 --> 15:23.303
[Marty] Conner, come on. Don't do that.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.871
Just tell 'em what you told me.

15:24.907 --> 15:26.506
It's gonna be great. Go ahead, tell 'em.

15:26.542 --> 15:27.507
I've been an asshole

15:27.543 --> 15:29.309
and I'm sorry. Okay?

15:29.345 --> 15:30.477
[Sam] Yeah, you've been
a real fucking asshole.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.379
[Conner] Yeah. Yeah, I know,
you're totally right, but...

15:32.414 --> 15:33.814
you're my bro, bro.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.315
You're all my bros.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.517
Honestly, I appreciate
you saying all this, but...

15:37.553 --> 15:39.252
[Conner] Yeah, no, I get it,
man, I get it, words are cheap.

15:39.288 --> 15:40.854
But I think we can get
back to the way things were.

15:40.889 --> 15:42.689
When we had fun.

15:42.725 --> 15:44.057
Yo, honestly, that's all we wanted.

15:44.093 --> 15:45.225
And equal pay.

15:45.260 --> 15:46.560
Absolutely. Equal pay.

15:46.595 --> 15:47.561
Sam?

15:47.596 --> 15:48.996
What do you say?

15:49.031 --> 15:50.397
Yeah, okay.

15:50.432 --> 15:52.099

16:14.590 --> 16:15.956
Bullshit.

16:15.991 --> 16:18.525
We're just fucking over
the backup dancers, right?

16:18.560 --> 16:20.293
Yeah, I guess another way
you could look at it is,

16:20.329 --> 16:21.294
we gonna win that fucking consult.

16:21.330 --> 16:22.929
[Doug and Clyde laughing]

16:22.965 --> 16:24.264

16:25.734 --> 16:26.933
What's wrong with that?

16:26.969 --> 16:28.101
Jeannie kissed Sam.

16:28.137 --> 16:29.236
She 100% did. She did what?

16:29.271 --> 16:30.370
- [Doug] Right. I saw it.
- 100% yes.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.705
It was totally...

16:31.740 --> 16:33.473
almost totally chaste.

16:33.509 --> 16:35.375

- Yeah.

16:50.292 --> 16:51.958
I actually think I-I can do

Hey.

17:00.302 --> 17:01.935
Jeannie, Jeannie.

17:01.970 --> 17:03.370
What's going on? Why
haven't you called me back?

17:03.405 --> 17:05.071
I'd love to talk about this,

17:05.107 --> 17:07.307
but I'm on my way to
pick up my food stamps.

17:07.342 --> 17:08.608

Look, I'm-I'm sorry if
you didn't understand

17:11.814 --> 17:13.380

- I understood.

My life is being pulled in a
ton of different directions,

17:15.684 --> 17:17.217

Okay. Well, let's-let's
take a weekend away.

17:19.054 --> 17:20.820
That's why I think we should break up.

Wait, hold on, hold on.

about the speech, don't...

Mm... not everybody, apparently.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.636
Look, Jeannie, you're wrong, okay?

17:36.672 --> 17:38.672
You-you-you just don't
know how you feel.

17:38.707 --> 17:41.108
[clamor continues in distance]

17:41.143 --> 17:43.276
What are you doing? Y-You can't
just never talk to me again.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.678
Actually, I can.

17:44.713 --> 17:46.780
I'm a ghost, bitch.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.348
Oh, shit!

17:48.383 --> 17:50.150
Ya got burnt, son. [laughs]

17:50.185 --> 17:52.285
[Sam] Shit, man, were you guys
fighting because we kissed?

17:52.321 --> 17:53.954
'Cause, like, she was just, like,

17:53.989 --> 17:55.288
really upset about what you said, dawg.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.923
- What?!
- [Conner] Hey, hey!

17:56.959 --> 17:58.558
- Whoa, whoa!
- Keep your hands off my boy, man!

17:58.594 --> 18:02.496
[all shouting at once]

18:04.199 --> 18:05.198
[sighs, groans]

18:09.171 --> 18:10.203
Tess.

18:10.239 --> 18:11.204
Hey.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.506
Long time, no talk.

18:12.541 --> 18:14.608
Yeah.

18:14.643 --> 18:16.676
I was fucking pissed.

18:16.712 --> 18:18.311
You were a jerk at the TED Talk...

18:18.347 --> 18:19.312
I know.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.715
...after all of the support I gave you,

18:21.750 --> 18:25.385
after I basically handed the TED
Talk to you on a golden platter.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.320
Ooh, I wouldn't say "handed it to me..."

18:27.356 --> 18:28.688
Whatever, Doug.

18:28.724 --> 18:30.557
I just came in person to
tell you that we're over.

18:30.592 --> 18:31.858
Hey, hey.

18:31.894 --> 18:33.560
Tess...

18:35.898 --> 18:37.998
We still have your business, right?

18:38.033 --> 18:39.733
God damn.

18:39.768 --> 18:40.901
What?

18:40.936 --> 18:43.904
I cannot believe I never
saw what a dick you are.

18:43.939 --> 18:45.138
You know what, Doug?

18:45.174 --> 18:46.273
Fuck you.

18:46.308 --> 18:47.541
Okay.

18:47.576 --> 18:49.876
You can keep my business on one condition.

18:49.912 --> 18:51.044
What? Anything.

18:51.079 --> 18:53.246
Make me Dungeon Master

18:53.282 --> 18:54.915
or I'll leave K and A.

18:54.950 --> 18:55.916
[snorts]

18:55.951 --> 18:57.918
No, but seriously...

18:57.953 --> 18:59.686
I'm deadly serious.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.555
Well, bad news.

19:01.590 --> 19:02.722
We lost Tess's business.

19:02.758 --> 19:04.124
The fuck are you talking about?

19:04.159 --> 19:05.392
I'm as surprised as you are. Yeah.

19:05.427 --> 19:06.393
Well, did she say why?

19:06.428 --> 19:08.295
I don't know. A woman scorned?

19:08.330 --> 19:09.529
She was unreasonable. I tried everything.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.131
- I know you're lying...
- Hmm?

19:11.166 --> 19:12.465
...I just don't know how.

19:12.501 --> 19:14.100
Guys, let's just focus on this, okay?

19:14.136 --> 19:15.502
- We're gonna crush this.
- Yeah.

19:15.537 --> 19:17.270
- Then I'm gonna fuckin' crush you.
- What?

19:17.306 --> 19:18.872
- [Marty] Hey, hey!
- [Jeannie] Hey!

19:18.907 --> 19:20.073
- [Doug] Hey...
- Look at all these happy faces.

19:20.108 --> 19:22.776
Let's start by
congratulating D'ream Out Loud

19:22.811 --> 19:24.611
on re-signing with CMG

19:24.646 --> 19:25.879
for five more years!

19:25.914 --> 19:27.581
- [whooping]
- All right!

19:27.616 --> 19:28.915
[chanting] Five more years!

19:28.951 --> 19:30.984
- I'll drink to that.
- Five more years!

19:31.019 --> 19:32.485
How 'bout we do this, fellas?

19:32.521 --> 19:34.654
Show these guys what their next
five years looks like, Clyde.

19:34.690 --> 19:35.989
Here we go.

19:36.024 --> 19:38.425
The baseline pro forma,
if the band continues

19:38.460 --> 19:41.161
on the same trajectory,
is a five-year CAGR of

19:41.196 --> 19:44.898
14% with an NPV of $120 million.

19:44.933 --> 19:48.235
- [whistles]
- I don't know what those "words" mean,

19:48.270 --> 19:49.636
but $120 mil sounds dope.

19:49.671 --> 19:51.238
- [chuckling]
- [Marty] That is very dope.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.472
But you know what?

19:52.507 --> 19:53.607
We can do even better.

19:53.642 --> 19:54.975
Oh, well, then let's do better.

19:55.010 --> 19:56.676
You got it.

19:56.712 --> 19:58.078
All right, first things first.

19:58.113 --> 20:01.081
Conner will announce that
he is leaving the band.

20:02.084 --> 20:03.583
- What?
- Wait, what is...

20:03.619 --> 20:05.952
You're leaving the band?
Leaving <i>our</i> band?

20:05.988 --> 20:07.654
- That's not good.
- [Marty] Guys. Guys. Guys.

20:07.689 --> 20:08.655
Guys.

20:08.690 --> 20:10.190
Then the band will announce

20:10.225 --> 20:12.826
that it is doing a Good-Bye Conner Tour.

20:12.861 --> 20:15.161
That Good-Bye Conner
Tour raises year one NPV

20:15.197 --> 20:17.297
to $170 million.

20:17.332 --> 20:19.532
[Marty] Conner will
then record a solo album

20:19.568 --> 20:21.134
featuring a duet with CMG

20:21.169 --> 20:23.670
recording artist Katy Perry and a tour.

20:23.705 --> 20:25.805
We can assume two charting singles

20:25.841 --> 20:27.340
and sold-out intimate venues.

20:27.376 --> 20:30.277
[Marty] And, of course, there's
the solo Conner tour merch.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.578
What have we got? Hoodies, posters...

20:31.613 --> 20:32.679
yarmulkes, maybe, Conner?

20:32.714 --> 20:34.714
- Think about it.
- [Doug] That pulls in

20:34.750 --> 20:36.383
a very conservative $62 million dollars,

20:36.418 --> 20:38.451
raising the NPV to $230 million.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.819
$230 million.

20:39.855 --> 20:41.788
Meanwhile, DOL will continue to tour.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.356
Then, after a year,

20:43.392 --> 20:45.525
Conner will realize that

20:45.560 --> 20:46.860
he can't live without the band.

20:46.895 --> 20:49.663
He just misses his boys too much.

20:49.698 --> 20:50.964
There will be a reunion tour.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.133
[Jeannie] The tour will be a marquee venue

20:53.168 --> 20:54.901
global event with premium tiered pricing.

20:54.936 --> 20:58.405
[Marty] After tickets and other
ancillaries, we're looking at a

20:58.440 --> 21:01.875
mid-range five year of $320 million.

21:01.910 --> 21:03.209
[Clyde] That is almost

21:03.245 --> 21:05.145
three times the baseline.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.146
Just hang on a second.

21:06.181 --> 21:07.213
You only apologized to us

21:07.249 --> 21:08.381
so that we would resign?

21:08.417 --> 21:09.816
No. I meant every word of what I said.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.384
- You guys really are my brothers.
- Oh, yeah.

21:11.420 --> 21:13.019
And equal pay was bullshit, too,

21:13.055 --> 21:14.587
- or what? I mean...
- Now, no... - You...

21:14.623 --> 21:15.922
[Marty] Hold it. Everyone in DOL,

21:15.957 --> 21:17.090
the four of you, will have parity.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.325
Huh?

21:18.360 --> 21:19.693
They don't know what it means.

21:19.728 --> 21:20.894
That means equal pay.

21:20.929 --> 21:22.128
It's, everybody's gonna
make the same. Yeah.

21:22.164 --> 21:23.296
- DO... Yes.
- Across the board, yes.

21:23.332 --> 21:25.398
DOL will have equal pay. However, Conner

21:25.434 --> 21:27.334
will have a separate solo contract.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.570
But in D'ream Out Loud, we're equal.

21:30.605 --> 21:31.738
[Doug] Yeah.

21:31.773 --> 21:34.174
- Oh, hell, yeah!
- Yeah.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.009
[Ryder] Boom! My brother!

21:36.044 --> 21:37.711
- [Marty] There you go.
- Get that money, man.

21:37.746 --> 21:38.845
[Marty] Yeah, let's get the money.

21:38.880 --> 21:39.846
- [Ryder] Yarmulkes.
- [Clyde] Yarmulkes.

21:39.881 --> 21:40.947
[all laughing]

21:40.982 --> 21:42.382
- [Marty] Bring it in, boys.
- [Hunter] Yeah.

21:42.417 --> 21:43.883
[indistinct, overlapping chatter]

21:43.919 --> 21:45.885
[Hunter] Shots for everybody, yo!

21:45.921 --> 21:47.354
You knew I wanted out.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.855
You played me.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.090
Before you get too upset,

21:50.125 --> 21:52.359
you're about to make a
whole hell of a lot of money.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.593
Yeah? Man, fuck you.

21:53.628 --> 21:55.295
Fuck you!

21:55.330 --> 21:57.597
Hey, you'll be okay.

21:57.632 --> 21:59.265
- [Marty] Douglas?
- Oh.

21:59.301 --> 22:00.667
[Marty] My office.

22:00.702 --> 22:03.069
[Doug] Ah, shit.

22:03.105 --> 22:05.205
[Marty] Hey, Jeannie?

22:05.240 --> 22:06.473
Can I get that MALD, please?

22:06.508 --> 22:08.274
Yeah.

22:08.310 --> 22:09.275
- Thank you.
- That was shitty,

22:09.311 --> 22:10.510
what we did in there.

22:10.545 --> 22:13.380
Yeah, well, sorry that
your pop idol boyfriend

22:13.415 --> 22:14.914
is mad at you, but look on the bright side.

22:14.950 --> 22:16.950
You'll probably end up in a song.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.053
Don't-don't give me the look, okay?

22:20.088 --> 22:21.521
We have done worse than that.

22:21.556 --> 22:22.756
You personally

22:22.791 --> 22:23.957
have done far worse.

22:23.992 --> 22:25.925
I know. I know. We screw people

22:25.961 --> 22:28.595
over all the time, and I get it when

22:28.630 --> 22:30.830
it's to build the business up for us,

22:30.866 --> 22:32.732
but if we're just gonna
hand the whole thing over

22:32.768 --> 22:34.701
to Skip Galweather...

22:34.736 --> 22:36.903
I'm... what's the point?

22:36.938 --> 22:39.639
The point is money, Jeannie.

22:39.674 --> 22:41.508
We already have a lot of money, Marty.

22:41.543 --> 22:46.279
And more money... isn't
gonna make you any happier.

22:46.314 --> 22:47.947
You know what? Maybe you're right, okay?

22:47.983 --> 22:49.249
But winning will.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.519
Hey, I just want to say thanks so much

22:52.554 --> 22:54.053
for all your fuckin' help.

22:54.089 --> 22:56.189
I want to... How'd she help?

22:56.224 --> 22:58.825
- <i>Hey, hey, keep your hands off my boy, man.</i>
- What's tha...

22:58.860 --> 23:00.059
It's not funny.

23:00.095 --> 23:01.361
- I'm just...
- It's not.

23:01.396 --> 23:05.432
Okay. I'm just saying,
the dude's got my vote now.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.434
[glass clinks]

23:07.469 --> 23:10.804
[Ron] You did amazing work.

23:12.541 --> 23:14.808
Followed every lead, did everything right.

23:14.843 --> 23:16.643
Nothing you could have done.

23:16.678 --> 23:18.778
Nothing I could have done?

23:21.049 --> 23:24.017
[scoffs] Great.

23:24.052 --> 23:25.652
Lost the fucking CMG account, huh?

23:25.687 --> 23:27.187
How does that happen, Ron?

23:27.222 --> 23:28.555
We fucking killed that shit.

23:28.590 --> 23:30.256
We got CMG.

23:30.292 --> 23:32.325
Skip just called.

23:32.360 --> 23:36.162
Told me that he and the Kohl
brothers are going with Monica.

23:37.566 --> 23:39.132
'Cause we lost.

23:42.237 --> 23:44.337
[groans] Wow.

23:44.372 --> 23:46.372
Well, you know what?

23:46.408 --> 23:49.642
That doesn't give us a
whole lot of time, does it?

23:49.678 --> 23:51.678
Uh, doesn't give us any time.

23:51.713 --> 23:52.979
Did you hear what I just said?

23:53.014 --> 23:54.314
Well, until they sign on that dotted line,

23:54.349 --> 23:55.682
we can still win this thing.

23:55.717 --> 23:58.117
We just got to bring the Kohl
brothers something fuckin' huge.

23:58.153 --> 24:00.453
K and A can lasso another
company, I don't care how huge,

24:00.489 --> 24:01.621
it's not gonna move the dial.

24:01.656 --> 24:03.089
I-I didn't say "company."

24:07.295 --> 24:08.595
What about a country?

24:08.630 --> 24:09.896
What?

24:09.931 --> 24:12.198
You still have a connection in Cuba, right?

24:12.234 --> 24:14.300
Your contact.

24:14.336 --> 24:16.035
I don't know if Cuba's
ready for the Kohl brothers.

24:16.071 --> 24:17.637
Let's make 'em ready.

24:20.075 --> 24:21.107
Okay.

24:21.142 --> 24:24.310
Let's get fucking Cuba.
