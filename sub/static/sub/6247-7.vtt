WEBVTT

00:05.200 --> 00:07.236
- Name?
- You know my name.

00:07.320 --> 00:12.838
You are making a request to the FBI to carry
a concealed weapon. I have to follow protocoI.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.674
- It's ridiculous.
- Fine. We're done. Do you want to get coffee?

00:16.760 --> 00:19.228
My name is Dr Temperance Brennan.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.676
- Reason for wanting a gun.
- To shoot people. It's the truth.

00:23.760 --> 00:29.312
You know, I'm writing, "Self-defence
in the performance of my duties

00:29.400 --> 00:31.914
pursuing suspected felons

00:32.000 --> 00:34.992
as contracted out to the FBI."

00:35.080 --> 00:39.232
- So I can shoot them.
- Ever been charged with a felony?

00:39.320 --> 00:41.436
- Charged or convicted?
- Charged.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.715
- You know I have.
- I have to ask.

00:43.800 --> 00:48.271
- Bureaucratic nonsense.
- Nevertheless, name of the arresting officer?

00:48.360 --> 00:50.316
You.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.233
SpeciaI Agent Seeley Booth.
You need me to spell that?

00:53.320 --> 00:56.517
- I can sound that out.
- So when do I get the gun?

01:01.200 --> 01:03.430
- You can't have a gun.
- Why not?

01:03.520 --> 01:06.910
- You were charged with a felony.
- Write down that you were wrong.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.788
- Oh, there's no space for that.
- Then why'd we go through all this?

01:10.880 --> 01:15.795
You have a constitutionaI right to apply
for a weapon. I would never deny your right.

01:15.880 --> 01:18.792
- I need a gun.
- Rules are rules.

01:18.880 --> 01:22.839
Tell them that I shot a murderer
who was going to light me on fire.

01:22.920 --> 01:26.629
Which is why you weren't convicted,
but you did shoot an unarmed man.

01:26.720 --> 01:31.555
I can't ignore that. I swore an oath to
protect society from people who shoot people.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.997
It was only his leg, and he's in jaiI for
life. How much is he gonna use it anyway?

01:36.080 --> 01:39.356
- You have the right to an appeaI.
- To whom?

01:40.040 --> 01:41.792
Cullen?

01:41.880 --> 01:46.795
- I'm pretty sure he doesn't like me.
- Yeah. I'm pretty sure you're right.

01:47.320 --> 01:50.949
Bones, you don't need a gun. If
anyone needs shooting, I'll do it.

01:51.040 --> 01:56.068
What if you're injured or dead? I'm not hoping
it'll happen, I'm just stating a possibility.

01:56.160 --> 02:00.756
Come on. You know what, Bones? You're a
professor. You're not an FBI agent, OK?

02:00.840 --> 02:04.674
Use your mutant powers.
Just talk people to death.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.593
- Am I interrupting?
- I told them not to let you in.

02:07.680 --> 02:11.958
- I gave them your picture.
- Which is why I wore the tiny skirt.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.110
Very cute.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.836
- Amy Morton.
- Temperance Brennan.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.639
- You work with him?
- I'm a forensic anthropologist.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.915
I'm a defence lawyer.
I work against him.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.958
If it's all the same, I'd
prefer you two didn't bond.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.669
I want to get back. You said I could
fill out gun reapplication forms.

02:28.760 --> 02:31.194
Send it back by courier. No hurry.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.350
Nice to meet you.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.595
- What do you want?
- Remember Howard Epps?

02:38.680 --> 02:42.275
- Not likely to forget him.
- He's scheduled to be executed tomorrow.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.238
- My job is to keep that from happening.
- Best of luck.

02:45.320 --> 02:50.348
He deserves five minutes of consideration
from the man who put him on death row.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.796
I arrested Howard Epps. It was
the jury who sentenced him to die.

02:53.880 --> 02:58.795
They found a pubic hair on the victim at the
scene. They never figured out whose it was.

02:58.880 --> 03:02.873
Blame the judge who disallowed it as
evidence and the judge on the appeaI.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.555
- Epps was not well-represented. -
How long have you been on the case?

03:06.640 --> 03:09.313
- Almost a week.
- Less than a week, huh?

03:09.400 --> 03:14.679
Two judges, two juries, two prosecutors that
find Epps guilty, but it's me you come after.

03:14.760 --> 03:20.073
I'm asking, are you absolutely
positive Howard Epps killed that girI?

03:20.160 --> 03:22.355
Yeah. I am absolutely positive.

03:22.800 --> 03:27.999
The judges should've allowed the juries to
hear that that victim was with another man.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.072
- He still would've been convicted.
- Not if I'd been there.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.435
- You weren't.
- I am now.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.955
When was the last time
you looked him in the face?

03:38.040 --> 03:41.350
Cos you're a lot smarter
than you were seven years ago.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.795
A lot less angry.

03:43.880 --> 03:47.668
You might wanna check
out the evidence again.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:05.280 --> 04:08.955
I'd ask how you were doing, Howard,
but I guess we both know the answer.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.679
Agent Booth.

04:11.760 --> 04:15.799
- Did you come to apologise?
- I'm not the one who beat a girI to death.

04:15.880 --> 04:20.112
Your attorney wants me
to look you in the face.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.431
- Why?
- She thinks you're innocent.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.795
She's right about that.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.030
I didn't kill anybody,

04:29.120 --> 04:32.271
unlike you, the sniper.

04:33.760 --> 04:37.230
The girI who got murdered was smart.

04:37.320 --> 04:41.233
She was pretty. She
was from a good family.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.993
Someone has to die for that,

04:44.080 --> 04:46.435
and I'm all they got.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.592
OK. I looked you in the face.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.240
I read it can be hell.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.834
They say it's like going to sleep,

04:55.920 --> 04:58.753
but you're on fire.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.799
And you're paralysed
so you can't scream.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.158
I mean, that's all you
got sometimes, you know?

05:07.240 --> 05:09.515
The scream.

05:18.960 --> 05:24.876
- What if they get mixed up?
- I can tell them apart. Jeff and Ollie. I win.

05:24.960 --> 05:30.557
- What do you...? What? That one was mine.
- You had Jeff. Ollie won. You owe me a buck.

05:30.640 --> 05:35.509
- You want in on the action, Angela?
- No, thank you. I'm going to go have sex.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.909
- Have a good time.
- OK.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.433
You sure you don't want to
come? Troy can call a friend.

05:43.520 --> 05:48.469
I've been waiting months for these. It's a
partiaI skeleton from France. The Institute...

05:48.560 --> 05:54.476
You know, the whole point of the week is the
weekend. This is not the cabaret, my friend.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.596
Life is the cabaret.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.069
Come to the cabaret.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.319
It's like describing the moon to a mole.

06:03.400 --> 06:08.918
- I demand another beetle. He has a groin pull.
- Arthropods do not possess groins. Pay up.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.751
- Angela, looking good.
- And don't I know it?

06:14.160 --> 06:16.276
OK, our tax dollars hard at work.

06:16.360 --> 06:19.113
What's break time at the
FBI? Book burning? Oh, God!

06:19.200 --> 06:20.997
What are you doing this weekend?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.877
- I have plans.
- I'm serious.

06:22.960 --> 06:26.032
Between your girlfriend the
lawyer and the defence lawyer,

06:26.120 --> 06:28.315
your weekend must be booked.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.550
What is your thing with lawyers?

06:30.640 --> 06:35.475
Look, seven years ago a 17-year-old, ApriI
Wright, was beaten to death in a federaI park.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.393
Amy's trying to stop the guy
who did it being executed.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.075
- We're not pursuing your lawyer obsession?
- Amy doesn't think he did it.

06:42.160 --> 06:47.075
- And what does this have to do with you?
- Oh, if Amy doesn't turn over every stone...

06:47.160 --> 06:50.436
And you're one of her stones?

06:50.520 --> 06:52.909
- Do you think he did it?
- Yes.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.993
- What's her reasoning?
- A pubic hair that wasn't accounted for.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.355
Sounds like ajob for the FBI crime lab.

06:59.440 --> 07:02.557
It's a weekend deaI. Off the
books. But if you have plans...

07:02.640 --> 07:04.790
Wait.

07:04.880 --> 07:09.112
- This is a personaI favour you're asking.
- Not for me, for Amy.

07:09.200 --> 07:15.275
Well, your personaI favour would be for Amy,
but mine would be for you, strictly speaking.

07:15.360 --> 07:18.557
Please do me a favour.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.790
Please?

07:28.440 --> 07:34.276
<i>- Any remains withheld from buriaI?
- Not after the last appeaI.</i>

07:35.280 --> 07:40.308
I'd need X-rays from the ME and the
coroner. Originals. The copies are useless.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.712
- Bone scrapings, lab results, tox screens.
- The evidence will be here in an hour.

07:44.800 --> 07:48.190
I'll ask the others. I won't
order them. They might have plans.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.909
It's Friday night and
they're racing beetles.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.275
How much time do we have?

07:55.360 --> 07:59.990
Howard Epps will be executed
in 30 hours and 23 minutes.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.312
Let's start. Zack,
pull up the first X-ray.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.756
- Stress fractures on both tibias.
- What's that mean?

08:39.840 --> 08:44.197
- An old injury from dance or running.
- She was a cheerleader.

08:44.280 --> 08:49.593
The Chinese executed people by cutting flesh
off them. Called it the death of 1,000 cuts.

08:49.680 --> 08:54.356
- Fractured trapezium, scaphoid and radius.
- What's that mean?

08:54.440 --> 08:58.069
When she was being beaten, she
threw her arm up to defend herself.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.833
That's consistent with
the autopsy report.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.959
In medievaI Scotland, they'd tie a
convict's arms and legs to bent saplings.

09:05.040 --> 09:11.070
When they released the saplings, the trees
sprang apart and the felon was torn in half.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.913
- Should I grab particulates?
- That's clean.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.949
It's a phone number we found on the girI for
an old woman with no connection to anyone.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.271
Extensive damage to the skull,
smashed six to eight times

09:22.360 --> 09:24.555
with a narrow cylindricaI object.

09:24.640 --> 09:28.918
- The tyre iron was missing from ApriI's car.
- She'd had sex shortly before death.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.152
- ConsensuaI. No assault.
- The hair was never matched to anyone?

09:33.240 --> 09:37.199
No. The prosecution got it excluded
from evidence in triaI and on appeaI.

09:37.280 --> 09:41.512
That's the basis of your lawyer's
last-ditch attempt to stop the execution?

09:41.600 --> 09:44.433
Yeah. And whatever
else you guys can find.

09:46.560 --> 09:50.872
There are particles lodged between
the left triquetraI and the capitate.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.997
The ME found they were bone
fragments dislodged by the tyre iron.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.868
- No. These shadows are too opaque for bone.
- What's that mean?

09:57.960 --> 10:01.350
The prosecution's theory does
not include matter in the bone.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.228
- Let's see if they're bone or something else.
- Like what?

10:05.320 --> 10:09.916
Let's pretend we're objective
scientists and not indulge in conjecture.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.197
Zack, get a driver to take
you over to Greenbelt Park.

10:13.280 --> 10:18.308
I want you to take pictures of where the
body was found. Ground covering, paved areas.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.709
- Why does he need a driver?
- I can't drive.

10:20.800 --> 10:25.112
- You're a genius who can't drive?
- If you knew what I do, you wouldn't either.

10:25.200 --> 10:30.797
<i>Take the file. Get photos of the area
to contextualise the materials we found.</i>

10:30.880 --> 10:33.189
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:33.280 --> 10:36.317
Yes. I'll be right there.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.198
That was ApriI Wright's father.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.669
- A victim's dad called you?
- Wife's a wreck.

10:41.760 --> 10:45.548
- They heard Amy's angling for a reprieve.
- Why did he call you?

10:45.640 --> 10:48.598
Because Booth was the agent
that arrested Howard Epps.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.433
I'm pretty sure that
evidence is not in the file.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.353
<i>Earlier you said, "It's
a phone number we found. "</i>

10:54.440 --> 10:57.750
<i>Wait. We're trying to save
someone you arrested for murder?</i>

10:57.840 --> 11:03.392
All right, I think he did it. I think this scumbag
bashed ApriI Wright to death with a tyre iron.

11:03.480 --> 11:08.429
We've found anomalies in the case. You want
us to stop before they become meaningfuI?

11:08.520 --> 11:11.239
No. Stay on it. I gotta get going.

11:59.880 --> 12:03.236
You guys are pathetic.
It's Friday night.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.835
There's nothing pathetic about pro
bono work on a death-penalty case.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.070
Everybody, this is Troy.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.720
Hey, how you doing?

12:13.080 --> 12:16.675
- Could you just wait here one second?
- Yeah.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.790
Why did you call me in?

12:22.880 --> 12:25.792
Look at this guy. He's cuter
than a monkey with a puppy.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.871
Uh-huh.

12:29.800 --> 12:33.873
I really, really need you to do texture
analysis on seven-year-old X-rays.

12:33.960 --> 12:37.270
But I am on a date. With Troy.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.750
He's a man. Wave.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.557
- What's the big steaming gigantic rush?
- A man is scheduled to die in 26 hours.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.235
I think he'd like the results
of our findings before then.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.675
Good one.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.877
Troy. Sweetie.

12:54.960 --> 12:59.556
I've got a few things to do around here. Do
you mind just hanging out for a little while?

12:59.640 --> 13:02.632
Sure. No problem.

13:02.720 --> 13:07.999
Let me call the restaurant and tell them
we'll be late. What do you think? Half an hour?

13:08.040 --> 13:10.998
- You better make it an hour, minimum.
- OK.

13:11.880 --> 13:15.714
- Hodgins.
- Recondite codes have a complex cipher.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.030
That's a fun factoid, Zack. Thank you.

13:18.120 --> 13:22.591
12402510221. That's the number
they found on the victim.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.638
You've got a photographic
memory, I'm good with ladies.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.393
It's not a phone number.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.915
Hey.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.719
So, what exactly do they do here?

13:36.800 --> 13:39.109
I thought Angela was an artist.

13:39.200 --> 13:45.673
She is. We do mostly forensic identification
and reconstruction of discorporated remains.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.877
My specialty's entomology
and particulates.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.997
Ever seen maggots? I just got these in.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.594
Do not talk to him.

13:55.400 --> 13:59.154
Wait in the lounge, baby. It's
up those stairs right over there.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.437
- Don't talk to anybody.
- OK.

14:21.800 --> 14:26.555
- What'd you find?
- A shard of bone. How'd they miss that?

14:26.640 --> 14:29.473
They're not as good as we are.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.676
40-times magnification.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.358
Well, that's not bone. It's inorganic.

14:37.440 --> 14:40.034
MineraI. Possibly quartz.

14:40.120 --> 14:44.398
I was taking pictures. There was a sign
and numbers. Why assume a quasi-random...

14:44.480 --> 14:48.109
Zack, when you talk that fast,
human beings can't hear you.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.875
The number they found
on the girI, 12402510221.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.793
Everyone assumed it was a
phone number, but what if,

14:54.880 --> 14:59.749
instead of spacing the numbers like a
phone number, you space 'em like this?

14:59.840 --> 15:05.870
I was in the park taking pictures, and
I saw the parking space was numbered.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.190
To get to picnic area 10,

15:08.280 --> 15:11.829
you go through gate 25.

15:11.920 --> 15:16.436
- Seems more than a coincidence.
- 1240- what do those represent?

15:16.520 --> 15:20.115
The time, 12:40, when she was
gonna meet whoever she was meeting.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.430
<i>It fits with the timeline.</i>

15:22.520 --> 15:27.753
- He's weird, but he's smart.
- ApriI Wright was setting up a date.

15:27.840 --> 15:31.594
Probably with the guy who
left the pubic hair on her.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.480
- Good job, Zack.
- I got something.

15:35.560 --> 15:40.270
It's not quite so idiot savant,
but it's aggregate graveI.

15:42.640 --> 15:47.430
What if the rest of the shadows
on the X-rays were also graveI?

15:47.520 --> 15:50.751
There was no graveI where her
body was found. It was all grass.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.559
Then she was killed someplace else.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.273
We have to exhume our victim's body.

16:06.160 --> 16:10.597
It's stressfuI waiting for this to be
over, and now Epps is trying for a reprieve.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.079
I heard.

16:12.160 --> 16:17.439
He got a lawyer from the Innocence Project.
They don't consider the family of the victims.

16:17.520 --> 16:21.195
You remember our lawyer, David
Ross. Agent Booth caught Epps.

16:21.280 --> 16:25.159
- Is this ever gonna be over?
- I understand how difficult this is.

16:25.240 --> 16:29.836
- Epps killed my daughter. You believe that?
- Yes, ma'am. I haven't changed my mind.

16:29.920 --> 16:33.754
- He deserves to die for what he did.
- The jury and the judge thought so.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.479
- All these appeals...
- It's part of the process.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.120
Each effort to stop his
execution is desperate.

16:39.200 --> 16:43.637
This one won't work either. It's the third
time. It'll be the third time they faiI.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.678
It's the last picture we have of ApriI.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.751
<i>She wanted to be a lawyer.</i>

16:48.840 --> 16:52.230
David was her role modeI. He gave
her ajob at his firm on weekends.

16:52.320 --> 16:56.279
- She was a good worker.
- Mm. She was a beautifuI girI.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.313
Excuse me.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.432
- It's OK.
- Booth.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.239
<i>- I'm with Amy.
- I don't like the sound of that.</i>

17:06.319 --> 17:10.518
- We're gonna try to get an exhumation order.
- What? Why?

17:10.599 --> 17:15.627
ApriI may not have been killed where
they found her body. You want details?

17:15.720 --> 17:18.553
- It's not a good time.
- We need to look at her remains.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.869
- Zach decoded the phone number.
- What?

17:20.960 --> 17:24.669
It's not a phone number. ApriI met
someone the night she was murdered.

17:24.760 --> 17:28.150
- So she met someone. What does that prove?
- Is this about ApriI?

17:28.240 --> 17:30.708
- Let me get back to you.
- What's happening now?

17:30.800 --> 17:34.873
- Apparently new evidence has surfaced.
- What kind of evidence?

17:34.960 --> 17:39.033
Give me a few minutes with Agent Booth.
Let me evaluate these developments.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.918
Let's get some coffee.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.191
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:51.640 --> 17:55.155
So this new evidence, is this
something they can bear to hear?

17:55.240 --> 17:59.119
It concerns the person ApriI had
sex with the night she was murdered.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.431
- The judge ruled that irrelevant.
- It's always hung there.

18:02.520 --> 18:08.197
It's always the basis of the appeaI. If we could
ID the guy, this whole issue would disappear.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.397
It was sex in a car. It was
probably another teenager.

18:11.480 --> 18:15.473
- A kid scared to come forward.
- Nobody said anything about sex in the car.

18:15.560 --> 18:19.872
It was a parking lot. I assume the
sex act took place inside a car.

18:19.960 --> 18:23.509
When ApriI worked for your firm
on weekends, did she do the filing?

18:23.600 --> 18:25.670
- That's right.
- Who was in the office?

18:25.760 --> 18:29.116
- Why do you ask? -
Well, a 17-year-old girI.

18:29.200 --> 18:33.637
I'm sure you just wouldn't leave
her in there all by herself.

18:33.720 --> 18:38.874
What? You can't remember? I'm sure the
security logs'll be able to tell us something.

18:38.960 --> 18:43.636
Refresh my memory, Mr Ross. Where were
you the night that ApriI was killed?

18:43.720 --> 18:46.553
Say around 12:30?

18:50.240 --> 18:54.711
Now's the time that I ask
for my lawyer and say nothing.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.118
- So, are you seeing each other?
- Who?

18:59.200 --> 19:03.273
- You and Booth.
- No. No, we're working together.

19:03.360 --> 19:06.238
Cos I'm picking up a bit of a sex vibe.

19:06.840 --> 19:09.718
No. That's tension.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.791
He has a girlfriend.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.997
- Tall, blonde, beautifuI?
- A lawyer.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.071
Figures.

19:18.800 --> 19:22.679
- Should've jumped him. I had the chance.
- You're interested in Booth?

19:22.760 --> 19:25.035
- You aren't?
- No.

19:25.120 --> 19:29.318
- Well, then why are you helping him?
- Because he asked me. He said please.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.512
Come on. You think he's hot.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.353
No. Not at all. This is
a very interesting case.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.477
Booth did say you had some
kind of mania for the truth.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.154
Mania? As in maniac?

19:42.240 --> 19:45.038
I'm not sure he meant it as a bad thing.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.949
Which obviously is how you're taking it.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.391
Do you want to start or shall I?

19:54.480 --> 19:56.471
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I'll start.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.994
I'm thinking of suspending you

19:59.080 --> 20:02.959
for freelancing on a death-penalty
case we cleared seven years ago.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.793
My intention was just to
tie up a few loose ends.

20:05.880 --> 20:11.318
- Do you disapprove of the death penalty?
- No, sir. I have no problem with it.

20:11.400 --> 20:15.313
Because I hear that you're working
for an attractive, young, idealist...

20:15.400 --> 20:19.109
Not true, sir. I mean, yes,
she's young and she's an idealist,

20:19.200 --> 20:21.589
but I'm not working for her. No.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.274
Like I said, there was a loose end,

20:24.360 --> 20:28.990
and I arrested Howard Epps. I provided the
evidence which led to the death sentence.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.789
- That's yourjob.
- I must be sure. This guy was her godfather.

20:32.880 --> 20:36.759
I believe he had sex with a 17-year-old
girI the night she was murdered.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.274
A fact that the jury
never heard, by the way.

20:39.360 --> 20:43.797
He's married. He's partners in a law
firm. The guy's got everything to lose.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.792
If you want to question him, fine.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.630
Is that the end of your
involvement, Agent Booth?

20:53.080 --> 20:58.234
Not exactly. They're moving to
exhume the victim's body, sir.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.914
On whose recommendation?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.036
The young idealist lawyer,

21:03.120 --> 21:05.315
and Dr Brennan.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.515
Got the squints involved.

21:08.600 --> 21:14.152
Well, if she shoots anybody this
time, I sure the hell hope it's you.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.314
<i>These are not the robes I wear to work.</i>

21:21.400 --> 21:26.793
- Sir, if you could tie your dressing gown?
- It's one in the morning. DeaI with it.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.872
So, you found a piece of
bone the size of a toothpick.

21:29.960 --> 21:34.670
Yes. A shard from her left
triquetraI with graveI embedded in it.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.274
Describe the implications.

21:37.360 --> 21:42.798
The jury was told that these shadows here
were bits of bone shattered during the attack.

21:42.880 --> 21:48.238
Through digitaI techniques, Dr Brennan's
team found that the density of the fragments

21:48.320 --> 21:50.436
is not the same as the surrounding bone.

21:50.520 --> 21:55.435
- What are they?
- The only way I can tell is by looking at them.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.239
- You want to exhume ApriI Wright?
- Yes, please.

21:58.320 --> 22:01.995
- Because of shadows on an X-ray?
- I don't see another alternative.

22:02.080 --> 22:08.428
Dr Brennan, if those shadows turned out to
be pieces of bone, I'd be extremely angry.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.193
- Thanks, Judge Cohen.
- For making a veiled threat?

22:11.280 --> 22:17.276
I thought you were threatening me because
you'd decided to sign the exhumation order.

22:22.160 --> 22:25.630
<i>I did not kill April Wright. There...</i>

22:25.680 --> 22:28.433
<i>there are good people out there.</i>

22:28.520 --> 22:31.193
<i>Y ou know, people who believe me.</i>

22:32.200 --> 22:35.590
<i>People who know I did not kill
that girl cos they saw the evidence.</i>

22:36.040 --> 22:39.715
I honestly think he's
innocent. Don't you?

22:39.800 --> 22:43.429
I don't like to form any conclusions
before all the evidence is in.

22:43.520 --> 22:47.354
<i>- Watch your step.
- ApriI Wright's body just arrived.</i>

22:49.800 --> 22:52.758
You might be more
comfortable staying here.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.394
- I-I can't.
- Oh, God!

23:08.480 --> 23:12.951
- Don't look, sweetie.
- You're not an artist. You're a freak.

23:13.040 --> 23:15.713
You people are all freaks.

23:19.880 --> 23:23.077
This job is so hard to describe online.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.948
The left triquetraI.

23:33.920 --> 23:38.835
- It's a match. For the record, do you concur?
- I concur.

23:40.040 --> 23:44.795
<i>- We've got foreign materiaI in the bone.
- It's the same stuff in the shard.</i>

23:44.880 --> 23:48.156
Which is consistent with
being dragged through graveI.

23:48.240 --> 23:52.358
I searched the house of the guy ApriI
had sex with the night she was murdered.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.795
- What did you find?
- Underwear.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.997
Can you run a comparison on the hair?

24:01.720 --> 24:06.475
<i>- Is that ApriI Wright?
- She wasn't killed where she was found.</i>

24:06.560 --> 24:08.676
Then where was she murdered?

24:08.760 --> 24:12.435
We've got particles beaten into
the skull. Were these ever ID'd?

24:12.520 --> 24:15.512
According to the autopsy report, no.

24:18.520 --> 24:22.274
- It's a visuaI match.
- Will you backstop him on that?

24:22.360 --> 24:25.511
- Where's Amy?
- I'm here. I can't...

24:25.600 --> 24:29.229
It's OK. Things can get pretty,
you know, disgusting around here.

24:29.320 --> 24:32.517
I concur with Zack. We have a
visuaI match on the pubic hair.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.319
Is a visuaI match enough
to stop the execution?

24:35.400 --> 24:38.551
<i>- We need DNA to be sure.
- Amy's right.</i>

24:38.640 --> 24:42.189
This evidence isn't enough
to stop the execution.

24:42.280 --> 24:45.477
And you've got nothing
else? Nothing at all?

24:45.560 --> 24:48.199
I don't know what else we can do.

24:48.280 --> 24:54.355
If you tell the judge you've changed your
mind, that Howard Epps is not guilty...

24:54.440 --> 24:56.431
- Have you changed your mind?
- No.

24:56.520 --> 25:00.718
I have doubts that the guy
should be executed, but...

25:03.360 --> 25:05.351
Let's go see the judge.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.032
At my age, a man needs
a good night's sleep.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.680
Lack of sleep clouds judgment.

25:26.760 --> 25:30.230
If you stay the execution, I
promise, you'll sleep like a baby.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.390
What does the prosecution think?

25:32.480 --> 25:36.314
This is a waste of the state's time.
Miss Morton is recycling evidence,

25:36.400 --> 25:40.757
presenting it differently in a last-ditch
attempt to stop Epps being executed.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.400
- She's an ideologue.
- That's true.

25:43.480 --> 25:47.189
But it doesn't mean I'm not
right. This case doesn't add up.

25:47.280 --> 25:51.751
You, brilliant scientist lady,
talk to me about this bone shard.

25:51.840 --> 25:56.072
It indicates the body was dragged to
where it was discovered. Plus the graveI...

25:56.160 --> 25:59.038
Common graveI. I'm not
convinced. What about the hair?

25:59.120 --> 26:02.749
A visuaI match. That narrows
the statisticaI probability to...

26:02.840 --> 26:05.434
- DNA?
- Ten days. We'll have it in ten days.

26:05.520 --> 26:09.354
What about this man that the FBI's
taken into custody? David Ross.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.715
- Has he confessed to sleeping with her?
- No.

26:11.800 --> 26:15.429
Even if David Ross slept with the
girI, it doesn't prove he killed her.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.351
Let's stick with new facts.

26:17.440 --> 26:20.750
At least give us time to find his
car. There could be evidence...

26:20.840 --> 26:24.150
I can't stop an execution
because there "could be" evidence.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.915
Judge Cohen, I have the
arresting officer right here.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.753
The primary investigator.

26:31.800 --> 26:37.591
Agent Booth, have you suddenly
decided that Howard Epps is not guilty?

26:37.680 --> 26:38.874
- No.
- Booth!

26:38.960 --> 26:43.875
- There are doubts and there shouldn't be any.
- He doesn't have doubts. He has cold feet.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.872
Think I won't pop you one cos
we're in the judge's kitchen?

26:46.960 --> 26:50.430
<i>You see? You lose sleep, you get cranky.</i>

26:50.520 --> 26:52.556
Judgment suffers. It's not enough.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.837
- You can't dismiss this so easily.
- Easily?

26:55.920 --> 27:00.072
I allowed you to exhume that girI's
remains. Do you think I did that easily?

27:00.160 --> 27:04.995
We all feeI the weight of a capitaI
case, Miss Morton, but the law is clear.

27:05.080 --> 27:08.356
Unless there is proof of
grievous incompetence by counseI

27:08.440 --> 27:12.319
or a deniaI of legitimate and
definitive factuaI certainties,

27:12.400 --> 27:14.550
my hands are tied.

27:22.080 --> 27:26.278
- I'll go out to the prison and tell Epps.
- I'll take another look at the skull.

27:26.360 --> 27:29.113
- Bones...
- The particulates haven't been analysed.

27:29.200 --> 27:33.398
This is so barbaric! When are they gonna
put a stop to the damn death penalty?

27:33.480 --> 27:36.677
- I believe in the death penalty.
- What?

27:36.760 --> 27:39.274
Certain people shouldn't
be in this world.

27:39.360 --> 27:43.478
The people who hacked hundreds of
innocent children to death in Rwanda,

27:43.560 --> 27:46.393
beheaded them at their desks at schooI,

27:46.480 --> 27:50.075
the people who did that,
they should be executed.

27:50.160 --> 27:54.039
- So why do you care about Epps?
- Because the facts have to add up.

27:54.480 --> 27:57.597
Drop me at the lab, please.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.910
Last meaI.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.037
I can't decide.

28:06.120 --> 28:10.477
- What's the last taste that I want?
- Howard, I am so sorry.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.153
Dr Brennan is still
working on a few ideas.

28:14.240 --> 28:18.199
You see the truth. You
know I'm innocent, right?

28:18.280 --> 28:20.840
I know there's a chance
you're not guilty.

28:20.920 --> 28:24.037
Well, that's good enough for me.

28:24.080 --> 28:27.550
A chance, I said. All right? A chance.

28:27.960 --> 28:32.158
<i>- These are slivers of metaI.
- Probably from the tyre iron.</i>

28:32.200 --> 28:34.953
<i>- Is that blood?
- Silt. I'm breaking it down.</i>

28:35.040 --> 28:38.794
- It contains traces of two chemicals.
- Anthracene and fluoranthene.

28:38.880 --> 28:42.350
I've scanned in all the
X-rays and built a 3-D module.

28:42.440 --> 28:45.079
Troy would've liked that. Bastard.

28:45.160 --> 28:50.871
I found some more materiaI in the
fractures along the sagittaI suture.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.188
<i>It's pollen.</i>

28:56.320 --> 29:00.950
<i>The pollen is from Spartina alterniflora,
more commonly known as smooth cord grass.</i>

29:01.040 --> 29:04.032
Sorry, what does pollen
tell us about ApriI's murder?

29:04.120 --> 29:06.111
Angela?

29:12.280 --> 29:17.798
The murder weapon collected
pollen from the surrounding flora.

29:17.880 --> 29:23.910
When she was struck, pollen from the murder
weapon was deposited in ApriI's skull.

29:25.720 --> 29:29.429
<i>Spartina alterniflora is only
found along Chesapeake Bay.</i>

29:29.520 --> 29:32.432
The pollen and silt both
showed traces of chemicals.

29:32.520 --> 29:36.479
- What does that mean?
- ApriI died in a marsh near a chemicaI plant.

29:38.440 --> 29:40.510
Amy Morton.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.352
Thanks.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.750
- They've moved Epps to the imminent room.
- What's that?

29:46.840 --> 29:50.276
It's where he has his last meaI
and says goodbye to his family.

29:50.360 --> 29:53.830
We need the location of that marsh.

29:58.960 --> 30:03.397
The hair proves you had sex with ApriI.
You're gonna be charged with statutory rape.

30:03.480 --> 30:06.756
But not by you. Statutory
rape is not a federaI crime,

30:06.840 --> 30:10.628
so I'm left to assume you're here to
get my client to confess to murder.

30:10.720 --> 30:13.598
- It adds up. It tracks.
- I didn't kill ApriI.

30:13.680 --> 30:17.389
You met ApriI in the park, but she
was killed near a chemicaI plant?

30:17.480 --> 30:20.313
- I don't know.
- You had sex. She threatened to tell.

30:20.400 --> 30:23.756
You couldn't let that happen.
You'd lose your business.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.035
- No.
- Do not engage with him, David.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.714
- You had motive, opportunity.
- I didn't kill her.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.597
- Why aren't you helping?
- What?

30:30.680 --> 30:34.753
By not admitting that you were there
that night, you're clouding the issue.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.400
So what? Epps will still
be in jaiI for life.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.630
We are not discussing that night.

30:39.720 --> 30:42.518
You are the only person who
can tell us what happened.

30:42.600 --> 30:47.993
- Do you care about what happened to her?
- I went there that night to talk, OK? That's all.

30:48.080 --> 30:52.437
- This interview is over.
- Just to talk. I'm not proud of what happened.

30:52.520 --> 30:58.675
I can tell you exactly why it happened, but I'm
not proud of it. I shouldn't have got pulled in.

30:58.760 --> 31:02.469
I didn't know it was her first time
and she'd get so upset. She ran off.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.838
- Are you telling me you left her in that park?
- No! I looked for her for two hours.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.150
I figured she called
somebody to get her.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.754
Was her car still there when you left?

31:11.840 --> 31:13.876
- Yes, it was.
- What time was that?

31:13.960 --> 31:15.871
- After 2am.
- Did you see anyone?

31:15.960 --> 31:20.112
Yeah, there was some traffic, all
teenagers. After 1am, there was nothing.

31:20.200 --> 31:23.510
Look, maybe it is my
fault that he got to her.

31:24.800 --> 31:28.395
You know, maybe I should
go to jaiI for that.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.911
He admits to having sex with her?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.389
- Yes, sir.
- Did he kill her?

31:37.480 --> 31:41.029
Well, he's either telling the truth
or he's setting up his defence.

31:41.120 --> 31:45.432
So ApriI Wright met David
Ross for a sexuaI liaison.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.910
He took her to a
second, unknown location,

31:49.920 --> 31:53.037
beat her to death, and deposited
the body back at the park.

31:53.120 --> 31:56.157
- That's sketchy.
- Which is why we have to find the weapon.

31:56.240 --> 32:00.279
Find a tyre iron in a marsh after
seven years? That's a long shot.

32:00.360 --> 32:03.511
That's why we need
metaI detectors and GPR.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.512
And a dozen or so agents, sir.

32:06.600 --> 32:11.310
And if you find this tyre iron, you can
positively identify it as the murder weapon?

32:11.400 --> 32:15.075
It's possible we can match the
traces we found in ApriI's skull.

32:15.160 --> 32:17.196
Possible? No.

32:17.280 --> 32:21.432
Epps' lawyer should present this
argument to the judge and let him decide.

32:21.520 --> 32:25.957
Sir, without the murder weapon,
he will not stay the execution.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.715
Way out on a limb here, Booth.

32:28.800 --> 32:33.351
He's just trying to find the truth.
Why should he be penalised for...?

32:40.160 --> 32:42.594
- Take the equipment and the men.
- Thank you.

32:42.680 --> 32:46.719
- She can't have a gun.
- No gun. Absolutely not. No. Thank you, sir.

32:47.920 --> 32:51.435
We have GPR, and more agents
will meet us out there.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.592
We'll have four devices so
we'll cover a lot of ground.

32:56.560 --> 33:00.189
I'm plugging in the data to get
the location with the closest match.

33:00.280 --> 33:04.831
Given the chemicals in the soiI, I'd say
we're looking for a spot near Rock Hall plant.

33:04.920 --> 33:09.630
We'll have video when we get to the bay, and
I need pictures of the grass we're looking for.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.039
OK.

33:47.560 --> 33:51.838
<i>There are four areas that
have Spartina alterniflora.</i>

33:51.920 --> 33:54.798
<i>It's a muddy area. Knee-high grass.</i>

33:54.880 --> 33:57.838
<i>OK, go back one screen.</i>

33:58.920 --> 34:01.480
It's just off that service road.

34:15.239 --> 34:17.514
We got it. We got it.

34:17.600 --> 34:21.353
<i>- Let me know what you pull up.
- We've got the tyre iron.</i>

34:24.199 --> 34:28.670
Here. I got something.
It's more than a tyre iron.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.629
- Is that what I think it is?
- I need a shov...

34:35.719 --> 34:40.714
<i>- I need a shoveI. She's digging here.
- Right away, sir.</i>

34:40.800 --> 34:42.597
Ma'am.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.398
Agent Booth?

34:50.880 --> 34:55.032
- Are you gonna help?
- Well, I would but this is a $1200 suit.

34:55.480 --> 34:59.758
Are you kidding me? I haven't slept in 48
hours and you're worried about your suit?

34:59.840 --> 35:02.513
Get over here.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.795
Fine. Can I get a shoveI?

35:04.880 --> 35:06.871
Thanks.

35:10.080 --> 35:13.755
<i>Dig gently, small layers at a time.</i>

35:14.360 --> 35:17.193
- What would you usually be doing?
- What?

35:17.280 --> 35:21.034
- If it were a normaI weekend.
- You want to discuss this now?

35:21.120 --> 35:23.680
Compared to you with
multiple sex partners...

35:23.760 --> 35:25.990
That's none of your business, OK?

35:26.080 --> 35:28.355
I'm not having sex with Amy,

35:28.440 --> 35:32.228
and I have never ever cheated on
any woman that I've ever been with.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.193
Never!

35:34.280 --> 35:38.193
- I just asked what you'd normally be doing.
- I'd be at a movie, dancing.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.840
Being with somebody that I care about.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.751
You?

35:57.800 --> 35:59.597
What the hell's going on here?

36:05.280 --> 36:09.319
Female, approximately
17 to 25 years old,

36:09.760 --> 36:12.228
blunt trauma to the skull.

36:14.400 --> 36:18.996
Also female, same approximate
age, same type of injury.

36:19.080 --> 36:24.438
This doesn't fit with Ross. If he killed ApriI, it was a panic murder
- personaI, not seriaI.

36:24.520 --> 36:28.513
Both these victims have been
dead for at least five years.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.398
- Maybe more than seven?
- Yes.

36:32.240 --> 36:35.152
Epps. It was Epps.

36:35.240 --> 36:40.917
He snatched ApriI after she ran from Ross
and brought her here to his killing grounds.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.755
- Why did he take her back to the park?
- He watched them have sex, saw them argue.

36:45.840 --> 36:49.549
Epps knew suspicions would
fall on Ross and took her back.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.790
And stole her car.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.758
- We got played.
- What? How?

36:54.840 --> 36:57.752
Either way, Epps wins.

36:57.840 --> 37:01.992
We find Ross, the execution is
stopped. We find these bodies...

37:02.080 --> 37:07.359
The execution is stayed untiI
these murders are investigated.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.714
If I don't make this call,

37:14.800 --> 37:17.439
he's gonna be dead in half an hour.

37:22.320 --> 37:26.279
<i>But these women, they
deserve to be heard.</i>

37:26.360 --> 37:28.510
It's what we do, Booth.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.795
- The rest...
- Lawyers.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.549
Lawyers.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.556
Amy, it's Booth.

37:44.640 --> 37:50.829
I think we got you your stay of execution,
but you're not gonna like it much.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.195
Thank you.

38:01.280 --> 38:04.875
- AII I can say is thank you.
- What's that, Howie?

38:04.960 --> 38:07.758
Practising to getjury sympathy?

38:08.680 --> 38:11.240
I did not kill anyone.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.355
Thank you.

38:23.440 --> 38:24.873
I mean it.

38:24.960 --> 38:29.112
We found the tyre iron. You'll
be found guilty of these murders.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.200
Well, I need a good lawyer.

38:33.280 --> 38:36.716
These murder investigations
take a long time.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.238
Then there's the appeals.

38:40.680 --> 38:43.752
And since I should've been
dead a half an hour ago,

38:43.840 --> 38:46.354
it's all gravy from now on.

38:46.920 --> 38:50.435
We gave him everything he wanted.

38:50.520 --> 38:54.274
Who knows if there'll even
be a death penalty then?

38:55.360 --> 38:57.874
I mean, that's your dream, isn't it?

38:58.880 --> 39:01.838
We want the same things from life.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.635
And I owe you too.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.279
I read your book.

39:14.360 --> 39:19.593
When I heard you were working with Booth
here, I knew you were just what I needed.

39:24.560 --> 39:29.509
- You gonna arrest me for assault? -
From what I saw, purely self-defence.

39:29.600 --> 39:35.072
- Maybe I shouldn't carry a gun after all.
- Hell, you can have mine.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.952
- What's the matter with you two?
- Bad day at work.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.759
Well, that's what you get
for working on weekends.

39:47.840 --> 39:51.674
You ever hear about taking some
time off, having a little fun?

39:51.760 --> 39:54.718
Why? What did you do?

39:54.800 --> 40:00.511
I'd be breaking about six laws if I just told
you how I manoeuvred on my Saturday nights.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.951
- But I will bring you some food.
- I'm not hungry.

40:06.960 --> 40:10.589
No use arguing with Sid, Bones.

40:13.040 --> 40:17.033
<i>Are you in trouble with your boss?</i>

40:18.760 --> 40:21.433
I'm sorry for wrecking
your weekend for nothing.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.238
No, not for nothing.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.517
You know what I mean.

40:26.600 --> 40:29.319
You know, all that running around,

40:29.400 --> 40:31.914
it didn't change anything.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.309
Epps was guilty. He was always guilty.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.391
There was doubt.

40:36.480 --> 40:40.029
We had an obligation
to respect that doubt.

40:40.120 --> 40:43.351
We all share in the death
of every human being.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.874
- Very poetic.
- No. Very literaI.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.118
We all share DNA.

40:48.200 --> 40:52.910
When I look at a bone, it's not some
artefact that I can separate from myself,

40:53.000 --> 40:57.152
it's a part of a person who
got here the same way I did.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.471
It should never be easy
to take someone's life.

41:00.560 --> 41:03.438
I don't care who it is.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.671
What?

41:10.400 --> 41:12.356
What?

41:12.440 --> 41:18.151
You've been practising your NobeI-prize
speech just a little too much.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.152
Scallops in Szechwan garlic
sauce, duck fried rice.

41:21.240 --> 41:24.869
- Here you go.
- Apple pie, hot cup ofjoe.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.640
<i>To simple pleasures, my friends.</i>

41:31.640 --> 41:33.631
Simple pleasures.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.156
