Investing
in your sexuality is

investing in
your well-being.

00:05.739 --> 00:08.076

Isn't your pleasure worth it?

I think
my vagina's worth it.

Karley: They say you can't
put a price tag on love,

00:25.293 --> 00:27.395
but this butt plug cost $7,

00:27.428 --> 00:31.132
and it's a piece of garbage/it
gave me a yeast infection.

00:31.165 --> 00:34.302
Do I have a budget sex life?

00:34.335 --> 00:37.138
As a general rule, the more
expensive something is,

00:37.171 --> 00:39.273
the better, and by that logic,

00:39.307 --> 00:41.442
the more money you spend
on your sex life,

00:41.475 --> 00:44.278
the more fulfilling it must be.

00:44.312 --> 00:48.116
Well, considering that free
orgasms are totally inoffensive,

00:48.149 --> 00:52.820
imagine having an orgasm
that costs as much as car.

more money in my vagina?

can walk into a sex shop

of trashy plastic dildos

01:14.442 --> 01:16.244
and mock lace skankware,

01:16.277 --> 01:19.647
but back in the day,
owning sex toys was a luxury,

01:19.680 --> 01:23.617
and people took pride in
crafting beautiful sex objects.

Stuart:
Yeah, beautiful, right?

01:49.843 --> 01:52.880
These seem dangerous.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.648
Yeah,
they look dangerous.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.484
These three examples are from
the turn of the 20th century

01:56.517 --> 01:59.487
where electricity was
revolutionizing our sex lives.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.557
You're looking at 120-year-old
luxury sex toys here.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.593
The design has changed
a bit over the years.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.161
Yeah.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.530
Like, something that you
would make a cake with.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.299
Right?

02:11.332 --> 02:12.700
These would probably be
quite expensive for their time

02:12.733 --> 02:14.368
'cause these are incredibly
innovative products.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.636
If you could figure out a way
to plug these in,

02:15.669 --> 02:18.339
these would still
get the job done.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.408
Do you know of any kings
or queens

02:20.441 --> 02:23.611
that were known for having
a really luxurious sex life?

02:23.644 --> 02:26.680
Catherine the Great
was the czarina of Russia

02:26.714 --> 02:29.250
in the 18th century.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.419
She had installed in
one of her palaces

02:31.452 --> 02:34.588
a hidden, luxurious sex room
where she had painted the walls

02:34.622 --> 02:36.590
in erotic images

02:36.624 --> 02:39.660
as a kind of sex nest
for her and her partners,

02:39.693 --> 02:42.563
with credibly explicit,
ornamental table

02:42.596 --> 02:43.964
that has
penises for legs,

that come up to your waist.

Stuart represents LELO,

02:55.309 --> 02:57.345
a company that designs
every-day sex toys

02:57.378 --> 02:59.580
for the slutty feminist,

02:59.613 --> 03:02.550

the most expensive vibrators

in existence.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.420
Glamorous!

03:06.454 --> 03:07.888
Is the LELO
gold vibrator

03:07.921 --> 03:10.358
the most expensive
vibrator in the universe?

03:10.391 --> 03:12.293
I don't know
about the universe,

03:12.326 --> 03:13.594
but it's certainly
on this planet.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.595
Yeah.
-It is?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.464
Yeah, it's $15,000.

I think it's still the most
expensive sex toy in the world.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.870
Do you sell
a lot of gold vibrators?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.772
Yeah, more than
you expect actually.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.474
There is quite
a market for it.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.476
People who are attracted
to luxury sex toys

03:28.509 --> 03:30.744
probably fall into
about three groups.

03:30.778 --> 03:34.014
There are people who have
just a love for gold,

03:34.047 --> 03:37.651
there are people who do see it
as social prestige,

03:37.685 --> 03:39.487
and then there's
the third group

03:39.520 --> 03:43.891
which is the people who find it
subversive or rebellious.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.826
There's something
inherently naughty

03:45.859 --> 03:50.598
about putting gold inside you
in a very sexual way, you know?

03:50.631 --> 03:52.466
Does a vibrator
being made of gold

03:52.500 --> 03:55.836
actually make the orgasm better
or the experience better?

03:55.869 --> 03:59.507
Your physical sensations and,
in this case, your pleasure,

03:59.540 --> 04:01.041
is a kind of construct
of your mind.

04:01.074 --> 04:04.945
That's where pleasure
is processed, and in that way,

04:04.978 --> 04:07.648
what a gold pleasure
product does is it --

04:07.681 --> 04:09.417
it's a kind of stimulation
for your mind

04:09.450 --> 04:11.018
as much as it is
your body.

04:11.051 --> 04:15.489
So, in that way, I would say
the gold has an advantage

04:15.523 --> 04:18.426
over any other kind of material
for personal pleasure.

04:18.459 --> 04:22.963
So, rich people have better
orgasms than poor people.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.733
Um...no.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.401
I think that rich people
have more expensive orgasms

04:27.435 --> 04:28.702
than poor people.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.372
That's a better way
to put it I think.

Talking to Stu, it sounds
like way more people

market than one would think.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.081
If this industry is so big,
then I wonder want to know --

04:41.114 --> 04:44.352
who else is out there producing
these luxury sex objects?

04:44.385 --> 04:48.088
**

04:48.121 --> 04:50.824
When it comes to the world
of luxury sex objects,

04:50.858 --> 04:53.060
no one compares
to Betony Vernon,

04:53.093 --> 04:54.695
a sexual anthropologist

04:54.728 --> 04:57.798
and a designer
of fine, erotic jewelry.

04:57.831 --> 05:01.902
Her designs have been exhibited
in art museums around the world,

05:01.935 --> 05:03.971
not to mention,
inside the bedrooms

05:04.004 --> 05:06.840
and butt holes
of the sexual elite.

05:06.874 --> 05:10.043
Betony's boudoir box is an
exclusive collector's piece --

05:10.077 --> 05:12.012
a custom set of fine objects

05:12.045 --> 05:13.981
that function as both
sex accessories

05:14.014 --> 05:16.350
and wearable jewelry.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.752
Betony:
I wanted to make something
that was bi-functional,

05:18.786 --> 05:20.854
can be used as ornamentation.

05:20.888 --> 05:27.127
It also has a sensorial function
with the power to please.

05:27.160 --> 05:32.099
I think that sex and desire
drive everything that we do.

05:32.132 --> 05:36.470
How many vibrators do you have
under your bed in a box, Karley?

05:36.504 --> 05:38.606
Like, literally 40.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.140
You see?

05:40.173 --> 05:41.875
And with my pieces, you don't
put them under the bed.

05:41.909 --> 05:46.079
You might even go as far
as to leave them on the table.

05:46.113 --> 05:49.683
Because they are objects,
also, of design,

05:49.717 --> 05:52.019
and you don't
have to hide them.

Why shouldn't a dildo
be beautiful?

06:15.543 --> 06:20.614
Uh, I'm wearing
four of my favorite rings.

06:20.648 --> 06:24.818
These rings are turned
on the inside of the hand

06:24.852 --> 06:30.491
to become extensions of the hand
at the end of the day.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.792
And they're used
for massage.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.428
I'll massage you later.

06:34.462 --> 06:37.565
Great.

06:37.598 --> 06:41.134
This is the Love Lock.

06:41.168 --> 06:46.039
The rings are also shaft rings,
and it becomes like a harness.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.608
So, you put it on him...
-Yeah.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.209
...and then
you're locked together,

06:49.242 --> 06:51.512
and you're connected.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.880
Yes.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.448
I get it.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.517
Sometimes the objects
are made for sensations

06:56.550 --> 06:58.686
that are lighter
like feathers.

06:58.719 --> 07:03.857
Sometimes they're also made
for more intense sensation

07:03.891 --> 07:07.628
because sometimes people
need more intense sensation

07:07.661 --> 07:10.531
to actually perceive
sensation at all.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.346
**

11:19.379 --> 11:21.081
I'm just in awe.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.316
I knew it would be spectacular,
but I-I had no idea

11:23.350 --> 11:25.953
it was going to be
this extraordinary.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.821
It fits in your apartment
really nicely.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.056
-It does.
-Yeah.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.058
Really beautifully.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.826
That looks like
a butt plug to me.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.962
Is it not?
Yeah, we call them
dilettos, Karley.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.396
Okay.

11:36.429 --> 11:40.901
But this is a also
beautiful vaginal tool, as well.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.436
All of the dilettos
also open,

11:43.470 --> 11:47.340
so you can put
scents or oils.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.742
Oh, my God.

11:48.776 --> 11:51.011
That's incredible!
Unbelievable.

11:51.044 --> 11:56.149
And you can fill it
with something to drink...

11:56.183 --> 12:00.020
once it's inside
your lover's body.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.488
This piece is called
"Why Not."

12:01.521 --> 12:05.125
A knitted, silver fiber.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.259
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.795
So, I'm assuming
it's a cock ring?

12:07.828 --> 12:09.797
-It's a stud.
-Unbelievable.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.332
But it's cool because you can
also wear it as a bracelet.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.068
Psychologically empowering about
being able to wear something

12:15.102 --> 12:16.770
as a piece of jewelry,

12:16.804 --> 12:20.407
but also knowing that
you've made love with that.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.542
Wow.
That's so hot.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.345
-So hot.
-Gets like an erotic charge.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.080
This is the yo-yo.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.417
This is more of
a flat-muscle massage.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.552
It feels so good.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.924
This muscle is very tense
in me because I text a lot.

12:36.957 --> 12:41.028
[ Both laugh ]

12:41.061 --> 12:44.297
What inspired you
to want a boudoir box?

12:44.331 --> 12:47.100
A little bit like owning
a unicorn in a lot of ways.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.302
It's the root
of what luxury really is.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.838
It's where it started.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.940
This idea of true
customization of something

12:52.973 --> 12:54.341
that's completely
considered --

12:54.374 --> 12:56.576
It's just magnificent.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.512
Do you think that this is
going to have an impact

12:59.546 --> 13:02.149
on your sex life or your
relationship with your partner?

13:02.182 --> 13:04.084
100%.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.087
These physical objects give the
opportunity to open up dialogue

13:07.120 --> 13:09.589
and to begin talking about it,
and that, to me,

13:09.622 --> 13:11.825
is the most important aspect
of being able to have

13:11.859 --> 13:15.528
a communication with my lover,
to explore and play.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.330
I hope
that you play a lot.

13:17.364 --> 13:20.233
Definitely.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.469
Karley: So, it seems Douglas'
concept of luxury

13:22.502 --> 13:25.272
is about rarity, beauty,
and craftsmanship.

13:25.305 --> 13:29.409
-I mean, it's unbelievable!
-Yeah.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.444
But is it possible to have
a luxurious self life

13:31.478 --> 13:34.214
without splurging
on a sex-toy tabernacle

13:34.247 --> 13:36.917
that's worth more
than my annual salary?

13:36.950 --> 13:40.453
Basically, can I achieve luxury
without the price tag?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.522
**

13:42.555 --> 13:47.494
When I started using tools
of glamour, I had power.

13:47.527 --> 13:55.002
**

13:56.203 --> 13:56.403
**

14:01.108 --> 14:03.310
It's clear that
the 1% have the best,

14:03.343 --> 14:06.513
or at least,
most expensive sex lives,

14:06.546 --> 14:08.916
but what about
the rest of us peasants?

14:08.949 --> 14:12.519
Does the average person
even know what they're missing?

14:12.552 --> 14:15.455
Do you think that investing
money in your sex life

14:15.488 --> 14:17.590
will make sex better?

14:17.624 --> 14:21.028
I don't find it necessary
to invest money

14:21.061 --> 14:22.662
in order for
your sex life to be good?

14:22.695 --> 14:26.133
An investment doesn't
necessarily mean money.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.903
Investing time and thought
into your sex life

14:29.937 --> 14:32.572
is probably better
than the money part.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.474
That was actually
deep and smart.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.110
Do you think that investing
money in your sex life

14:37.144 --> 14:38.511
makes sex better?

14:38.545 --> 14:41.014
100%, yeah.
Really? How come?

14:41.048 --> 14:43.550
Yeah.
Sex toys are important.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.019
When you get the good stuff,
it's better.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.420
Did you know that
there's vibrators out there

14:47.454 --> 14:51.691
that are made of gold
and cost like $15,000?

14:51.724 --> 14:55.428
Okay, maybe there are better
places for that money to go.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.164
$15,000?!

14:57.197 --> 14:59.199
Oh, my goodness.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.034
Karley:
So, it seems like most people
are vaguely triggered

15:01.068 --> 15:03.303
by the idea of spending
their kid's college tuition

15:03.336 --> 15:05.038
simply for the experience
of sticking

15:05.072 --> 15:07.507
some gold up their vagina.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.709
I got to thinking --
if there's some other way

15:09.742 --> 15:11.378
to add luxury to my sex life

15:11.411 --> 15:13.313
without blowing
my life savings?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.182
Idk.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.717
So, I'm going to talk to the
most luxurious person I know...

15:17.750 --> 15:19.319
Dita:
I love aesthetics.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.454
I've always loved being dressed
for pleasure.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.256
...Dita Von Teese --

15:23.290 --> 15:26.026
the famous model
and burlesque dancer.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.694
Karley: Lately, I've been
thinking a lot about the idea

15:27.727 --> 15:29.963
of sex and luxury.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.731
Do you think that adding
an element of luxury

15:31.764 --> 15:34.467
to your sex life
makes sex better?

15:34.501 --> 15:36.669
I don't know how it
couldn't make sex better.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.973
So, what is your
definition of luxury?

15:40.007 --> 15:41.975
Luxury, to me,
is very visual.

15:42.009 --> 15:46.646
I love surrounding myself with
things that turn me on visually.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.515
I think it's just
really that for me.

15:48.548 --> 15:52.152
I want to see as many beautiful
things as I can in my day.

15:52.185 --> 15:55.355
**

15:55.388 --> 15:58.625
When I was a little girl,
I grew up watching movies

15:58.658 --> 16:00.627
from the 1930s and '40s,

16:00.660 --> 16:05.098
and I really became
obsessed with glamour

16:05.132 --> 16:09.002
and things like high heels
and lipstick

16:09.036 --> 16:11.738
and curvacious clothing.

16:11.771 --> 16:15.242
**

16:15.275 --> 16:19.446
The desire to be objectified --
it's so taboo, right?

16:19.479 --> 16:23.783
But I really believe that it's
kind of liberating to engage

16:23.816 --> 16:27.387
in old-fashioned taboos
and just indulge in them.

16:27.420 --> 16:31.158
So, I've kind of
always enjoyed that.

16:31.191 --> 16:34.127
I remember my first glimpses
at a Playboy magazine

16:34.161 --> 16:36.329
under the bed.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.365
I was so struck
by those women.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.801
I was like, "Oh, I want to
be like those ladies."

16:41.834 --> 16:44.637
I'm a dishwater blonde
from a farming town in Michigan,

16:44.671 --> 16:46.273
and I was, like,
an ugly duckling

16:46.306 --> 16:48.241
and kind of disappeared
into the crowd,

16:48.275 --> 16:51.144
and then when I started using
tools of glamour,

16:51.178 --> 16:53.080
I had power.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.649
**

16:56.683 --> 17:00.453
I overcame really extreme
shyness through dance

17:00.487 --> 17:02.055
and glamour,

17:02.089 --> 17:04.691
like painting myself
and creating a character.

17:04.723 --> 17:10.696
**

17:10.730 --> 17:12.398
What advice would you
give to someone

17:12.432 --> 17:15.335
who's looking to increase
the luxury component of their...

17:15.367 --> 17:16.769
-Mm-hmm.
-...sexual interactions?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.405
Well, you know,
I always say lingerie.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.207
I can't help it.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.609
I've always loved beautiful
lingerie since I was very young.

17:23.643 --> 17:27.347
**

17:27.380 --> 17:31.184
My association
with luxury lingerie

17:31.218 --> 17:34.387
was really about
honoring myself every day

17:34.421 --> 17:37.824
and taking part
in a ritual of being a woman.

17:37.857 --> 17:41.328
I like the texture
of, like, a nice stocking.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.263
I like the snap
of a garter.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.298
I like the feel
of the metal.

17:45.332 --> 17:46.833
Just wear it
because you love it.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.536
Like, self-seduction is
really where it all starts.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.371
Does something have
to be expensive for it

17:51.404 --> 17:54.541
to be considered,
like, luxury or sensual?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.109
I don't think so.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.211
There's a lot of ways to,
like, get there

17:58.245 --> 18:00.180
without spending
a lot of money.

18:00.213 --> 18:04.584
Is it a luxury to take a bath
with rose petals and --

18:04.617 --> 18:07.487
and have a little bowl
of strawberries next to you?

18:07.520 --> 18:08.755
You know, is that --
is that expensive?

18:08.788 --> 18:10.223
No.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.592
But that feels like
luxury to me.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.761
**

18:14.794 --> 18:16.429
Dita's right.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.598
Luxury is about indulging
in whatever makes us

18:18.631 --> 18:21.234
feel like the slut goddesses
that we are.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.904
And personally, speaking as
a narcissistic ex-dominatrix,

18:24.937 --> 18:29.742
my ultimate turn-on is
something painfully specific.

18:29.776 --> 18:34.247
The best sex starts
when you start to get dressed,

18:34.281 --> 18:37.517
and it continues until
you choose to get undressed.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.753
**

18:42.322 --> 18:44.357
**

18:49.329 --> 18:51.398
Karley: As an aspiring sadist,
I'm on my way

18:51.431 --> 18:53.266
to fulfill my life-long fantasy

18:53.300 --> 18:56.269
of buying a custom, latex dress.

18:56.303 --> 18:59.406
You know, Ã  la BeyoncÃ©,
Kim Kardashian,

18:59.439 --> 19:01.774
or that "Project Runway" lady.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.676
The goal, of course,
is always to be

19:03.710 --> 19:06.179
the most luxurious slut
in the room.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.781
So, I'm going to the latex
seamstress to the stars,

19:08.815 --> 19:10.483
The Baroness.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.386
Her custom pieces can run
in the thousands of dollars,

19:13.420 --> 19:16.856
but there's also some
affordable slutty options.

19:16.889 --> 19:20.493
Baroness: You looking
for anything in particular?

19:20.527 --> 19:22.262
I'm generally
looking for a dress.

19:22.295 --> 19:25.432
Something that makes me
look expensive.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.733
Oh, okay.

19:26.766 --> 19:27.800
Well, let me show you
where our expensive,

19:27.834 --> 19:31.371
whore-starting-out dress.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.840
So, this is --
Actually, it's our Tart dress.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.442
Do you like the ruby?
Do you like...

19:35.475 --> 19:37.210
I like pink, red.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.346
I don't know.
There's this one.
I like that, too.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.348
I mean, I like everything,
so it's hard.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.316
Well, I'll give you
a few things to try on.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.818
So, come back here.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.287
When you get dressed,
you want to put it on

19:47.320 --> 19:48.555
using this product here.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.423
It'll make it slide
on your body easily,

19:50.457 --> 19:53.893
and just kind of around the
parts where it's gonna be tight.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.562
Give me a shout
if you need any help,

19:55.595 --> 19:58.665
and it doesn't slide on easily,
you need more lube.

19:58.698 --> 20:04.003
**

20:04.036 --> 20:05.605
Oh, good.
Okay.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.939
Come out and let me
just sort of fiddle with you

20:06.973 --> 20:09.409
because you're not
appropriately dressed yet.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.312
Okay.
Oh, I feel all lubed up.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.781
The dress should be
more flat on your body.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.350
**

20:17.384 --> 20:19.852
But this dress is
a little bit too big for you.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.954
It should fit you
like that.

20:21.988 --> 20:26.426
Would you say that latex
is considered a luxury?

20:26.459 --> 20:29.362
The thing about luxury is
that you have the time,

20:29.396 --> 20:30.797
which is the luxury.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.999
You have the occasion,
which is a luxury.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.634
And then you have
the Baroness latex,

20:34.667 --> 20:36.769
which is a luxury, so...

20:36.803 --> 20:38.571
Yeah,
it should be a luxury.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.841
And when do you think that latex
made the crossover

20:41.874 --> 20:43.376
between being something
that people thought of

20:43.410 --> 20:45.478
as associated with sex
and S and M

20:45.512 --> 20:47.780
to being more,
like, high fashion?

20:47.814 --> 20:51.050
It really had to be more just
the celebrities wearing it.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.487
People are thinking
about it more as fun, you know?

20:54.521 --> 20:55.655
"I'm a rock star."

20:55.688 --> 20:57.290
Do you feel like
wearing latex

20:57.324 --> 20:59.359
gives a woman
a certain type of power?

20:59.392 --> 21:00.760
Oh, without a doubt.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.462
It's almost unfair.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.763
I mean, you go out,
and you go like, "Well, I win.

21:03.796 --> 21:07.334
I just look the best
out of everyone here."

21:07.367 --> 21:09.636
I think that the best sex
that you can possibly

21:09.669 --> 21:11.671
have generally starts
at the beginning

21:11.704 --> 21:13.306
when you start
to get dressed

21:13.340 --> 21:15.408
and it continues
all through that time

21:15.442 --> 21:17.944
until you choose,
or not choose, to get undressed.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.412
It's about the ritual.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.880
It is.
It is.

21:20.913 --> 21:24.817
**

21:24.851 --> 21:27.420
I love the whole ritual of
my clothing being laid out

21:27.454 --> 21:29.556
while having a glass
of champagne,

21:29.589 --> 21:31.691
choosing, you know,
this jewel or that jewel.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.427
All of that
is charging energy.

21:34.461 --> 21:37.029
Have time
to remove your day

21:37.063 --> 21:39.599
and become the goddess
that you are.

21:39.632 --> 21:51.444
**

21:51.478 --> 21:52.845
What I learned
from my time spent

21:52.879 --> 21:54.781
with an array
of glamour sex-perts

21:54.814 --> 21:58.385
is that investing in your
sexuality can never hurt,

21:58.418 --> 22:03.990
be it with money, time, passion,
or golden vagina jewelry.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.792
It's about more
than just pleasure.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.794
It's the ultimate rebellion.

22:07.827 --> 22:11.898
And for me, luxury means
creating a sexy, sacred space

22:11.931 --> 22:16.636
where I can finger myself
while dressed like a royal slut.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.572
To each their own.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.808
Bling you later, sluts.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.543
[ Tink! ]

22:23.576 --> 22:28.147
