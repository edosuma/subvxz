WEBVTT

02:09.130 --> 02:12.091
<i>You little brats, get lost!</i>

02:18.264 --> 02:19.098
Hey!

02:53.132 --> 02:55.134
It should have been me!

02:55.551 --> 03:01.515
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.852
You'll miss the train.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.188
<i>Hurry.</i>

03:15.196 --> 03:20.117
PART ONE

03:44.934 --> 03:47.311
KOUZUKI NORIAKI

03:55.110 --> 03:56.528
<i>Go back to sleep.</i>

03:56.987 --> 03:58.781
<i>We're still far from the house.</i>

04:38.988 --> 04:41.365
<i>Pleased to meet you. I am Okju.</i>

04:41.448 --> 04:43.242
<i>This property has three buildings.</i>

04:43.325 --> 04:45.536
<i>A Western-style wing designed
by an English architect</i>

04:45.619 --> 04:48.038
<i>and a Japanese wing form the main house.</i>

04:48.831 --> 04:52.042
Not even in Japan is there
a building combining the two styles.

04:53.711 --> 04:59.008
It reflects Master's admiration
for Japan and England.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.177
Next is the annex

05:02.261 --> 05:04.722
which Master had furnished as a library.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.849
Last, the servants' quarters.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.268
As the Lady's handmaiden,
you won't sleep there.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.313
You may eat her leftover food,

05:12.396 --> 05:14.773
but tea leaves go to the kitchen girls.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.067
Used soap and oil are for the steward.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.070
Anyone caught stealing
is expelled that day.

05:20.154 --> 05:22.448
I'm sure you wouldn't dare, Tamako.

05:23.115 --> 05:28.620
"Tamako" is you, by the way.
It's your name Okju in Japanese.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.664
Everything in this household
is Japanese style.

05:31.790 --> 05:35.002
Use only Japanese to Master and the Lady.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.672
- Call me Sasaki.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:42.343 --> 05:45.763
I don't trust new handmaidens.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.765
Even though they greet you politely,

05:47.848 --> 05:51.018
they are always the first to take scrolls
and run away when there's a fire.

05:56.231 --> 06:02.237
<i>The Lady's routine is simple.
She takes walks or reads for Master.</i>

06:03.739 --> 06:07.409
Among the richest men,
Master is the greatest book lover.

06:07.493 --> 06:10.662
And among book lovers, he is the richest.

06:10.746 --> 06:13.707
<i>His ties to the colonial government
even let us use electricity.</i>

06:13.791 --> 06:15.376
In such a home,

06:16.960 --> 06:20.297
you should know what's expected
of a maid like you.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.886
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts.

06:51.412 --> 06:52.704
I sleep in here?

06:54.415 --> 06:57.251
Miss Hideko wakes easily
on account of her nerves.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.795
- She's behind this door?
- Sh!

07:59.521 --> 08:00.898
<i>Mother!</i>

08:05.903 --> 08:07.571
<i>Mother!</i>

08:08.238 --> 08:09.656
<i>Mother!</i>

08:11.658 --> 08:12.493
Miss!

08:12.910 --> 08:14.953
Miss, are you alright?

08:15.412 --> 08:17.206
<i>Junko! Is that you?</i>

08:17.956 --> 08:21.543
Junko was kicked out, Miss.
I'm the new girl.

08:21.627 --> 08:24.046
You must have had a bad dream.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.716
You see that big cherry tree?

08:28.383 --> 08:32.011
My aunt went mad and hanged herself there.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.515
<i>Sometimes on moonless nights,</i>

08:35.599 --> 08:37.392
<i>my aunt's ghost</i>

08:37.476 --> 08:40.812
<i>dangles from that branch.</i>

08:53.742 --> 08:55.369
Here, drink up.

08:59.248 --> 09:04.419
<i>When babies cry,
my auntie feeds them a spoonful of sake.</i>

09:09.508 --> 09:13.053
<i>Sweet bird, sweet bird</i>

09:14.012 --> 09:17.099
<i>My sweet bluebird</i>

09:20.978 --> 09:27.067
<i>What scent is this, that fills my nose?</i>

09:55.679 --> 09:58.265
Those fuckers.

10:00.684 --> 10:01.768
<i>This is Tamako.</i>

10:02.436 --> 10:04.730
I am at your service, Miss.

10:17.159 --> 10:21.121
A reference letter from Lady Minami,
my last mistress.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.919
So is this place to your liking?

10:30.339 --> 10:33.175
The sun scarcely ever shines here.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.093
Uncle won't permit it.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.680
<i>Sunlight causes books to fade.</i>

10:39.765 --> 10:42.309
One could never grow fond
of such a dreary place.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.025
Not a good liar, are you?

10:52.027 --> 10:54.988
We look alike.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.574
Don't you think?

10:57.658 --> 10:59.618
I'll take my leave.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.748
My late aunt

11:04.831 --> 11:06.708
and Mrs. Sasaki

11:06.792 --> 11:10.962
tried very hard to teach me
of a mother's love.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.007
But not really.

11:23.975 --> 11:26.978
My head aches
before every reading practice.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.525
Would you read it to me?

11:32.901 --> 11:33.735
Pardon?

11:43.620 --> 11:44.996
Oh, how kind of her.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.875
Lady Minami said
such nice things about me!

11:48.959 --> 11:49.793
Is that so?

11:53.380 --> 11:58.218
You're a Japanese lady,
why don't you speak Japanese?

11:58.719 --> 11:59.886
I'm sick of it.

11:59.970 --> 12:02.472
The books he makes me read
are all Japanese.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.101
So read that for me.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.157
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

12:21.366 --> 12:25.579
Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.706
Maids are like...

12:28.290 --> 12:29.750
a spoon... no...

12:30.959 --> 12:33.378
are like chopsticks..."

12:37.924 --> 12:40.010
Is it a spoon?

12:49.519 --> 12:51.271
I don't know how to read, Miss.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.526
Not at all? What about Korean?

13:21.259 --> 13:24.137
This is your name. Can't you read it?

13:30.811 --> 13:32.896
Reading can be learned,

13:32.979 --> 13:36.316
and I don't care if you curse or steal.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.535
But don't ever lie to me. Understood?

13:48.537 --> 13:49.663
Yes, Miss.

13:54.835 --> 13:55.669
She's my mother.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.841
She's beautiful, quite the charmer!

14:01.842 --> 14:04.386
<i>And me? Am I "quite the charmer"?</i>

14:06.680 --> 14:09.766
Everyone says
I can't compare to my mother.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.314
Count Fujiwara said...

14:16.940 --> 14:18.900
So you've met the Count?

14:19.359 --> 14:20.277
Pardon?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.028
No, I've never met him...

14:22.946 --> 14:25.782
My aunt! I heard it from my aunt.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.159
She was his nanny.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.871
What did the Count say about me?

14:32.163 --> 14:34.416
He said your face...

14:35.876 --> 14:40.130
Every night in bed he thinks
of your assets... your face.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.343
Why in bed, I wonder?

14:49.389 --> 14:50.849
What's with your foot?

14:57.564 --> 14:59.232
I've nowhere to go.

15:00.317 --> 15:03.361
I've just stayed in this house
since coming to Korea when I was 5.

15:05.697 --> 15:09.492
But in new shoes, even paths
I always take seem different.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.620
The ones from here

15:12.621 --> 15:14.497
<i>up to here should fit you.</i>

15:18.418 --> 15:21.129
Why don't you pick something prettier?
Like this one.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.091
It's time for reading practice.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.178
- I'll go alone.
- <i>Miss?</i>

15:28.720 --> 15:29.971
But it's raining.

15:46.237 --> 15:51.034
At noon, come knock on the door. Okay?

15:54.162 --> 15:55.747
<i>See you at--</i>

16:34.077 --> 16:34.911
This is...

18:18.932 --> 18:20.391
My new handmaiden.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.228
The snake, the snake!

18:29.984 --> 18:31.444
<i>You mustn't pass that point.</i>

18:32.320 --> 18:33.947
Be warned!

18:34.781 --> 18:37.033
The snake marks the "bounds of knowledge".

18:52.257 --> 18:55.510
He has a habit of licking the pen
when he's thinking hard.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.637
He's not a dirty person.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.809
What kind of a handmaiden
uses the umbrella for herself?

19:02.892 --> 19:03.726
Pardon?

19:05.270 --> 19:06.104
<i>Miss.</i>

19:06.563 --> 19:07.730
<i>Miss!</i>

19:13.069 --> 19:13.903
<i>Miss.</i>

19:20.493 --> 19:22.120
<i>I don't have an upset stomach.
It's okay.</i>

19:24.831 --> 19:26.791
<i>It's because the books are so boring.</i>

19:28.001 --> 19:30.795
You must read a ton of books.

19:30.879 --> 19:33.047
You must be so knowledgeable.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.018
I'm sorry about the prank.

19:45.894 --> 19:46.936
I won't do it again.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.189
Forgive me.

20:12.962 --> 20:13.880
The Count?

20:15.089 --> 20:15.924
Today?

20:19.844 --> 20:22.305
No wonder you insisted on a bath.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.141
When my aunt heard
a guest was coming,

20:25.225 --> 20:27.852
she dropped everything
and bathed her Baby Miss.

20:28.645 --> 20:33.149
Nothing made her happier than
when guests praised the baby's scent.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.403
You are my Baby Miss.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.866
Auntie gives babies candy during baths

20:41.950 --> 20:44.035
<i>to teach them how sweet bath time is.</i>

20:45.036 --> 20:45.870
What's wrong?

20:47.872 --> 20:51.209
One of my teeth must be sharp.
It keeps cutting me.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.381
<i>So this was the scent.</i>

22:37.523 --> 22:38.608
It's smooth now.

22:54.415 --> 22:55.583
Welcome, sir!

23:05.301 --> 23:09.514
You are too kind to greet me
like this upon my arrival,

23:09.597 --> 23:12.850
when the journey has left me so unkempt.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.268
Now your tedium is over.

23:14.685 --> 23:19.065
I'll ensure your painting lessons
are stimulating.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.486
This must be Okju.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.905
At your service, milord.

23:27.115 --> 23:30.618
You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position?

23:32.870 --> 23:36.332
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

23:36.749 --> 23:40.545
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

23:40.628 --> 23:43.131
<i>Thank you for introducing her.</i>

23:43.214 --> 23:47.969
<i>You found the perfect maid for me.</i>

23:50.513 --> 23:54.016
It was tough looking for one
that wasn't chubby.

23:54.976 --> 23:58.187
Take care of the lonely lady.

23:59.647 --> 24:00.481
Here.

24:21.127 --> 24:24.046
Count Fujiwara asks Miss Hideko
to kindly allow her maid Tamako

24:24.130 --> 24:27.717
to be sent to his Lordship
for a brief errand.

24:36.184 --> 24:38.644
Did you call for me, milord?

24:38.728 --> 24:39.562
<i>You may enter.</i>

25:19.477 --> 25:21.562
You tried to fool me with a fake coin.

25:21.646 --> 25:23.147
How dare you?

25:28.361 --> 25:32.823
<i>You think I'm Tamako,
a poor Korean handmaiden.</i>

25:33.366 --> 25:36.244
<i>But my real name is Nam Sookee.</i>

25:36.786 --> 25:42.917
<i>Raised by Miss Boksun,
top purveyor of stolen goods.</i>

25:43.000 --> 25:47.255
<i>I was able to tell a real coin
from a fake when I was 5.</i>

25:47.338 --> 25:50.424
<i>Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai,</i>

25:50.508 --> 25:54.095
<i>and pickpocketing from Kutan,</i>

25:54.929 --> 25:58.224
<i>but these babies will never
learn such useful skills.</i>

25:59.016 --> 26:01.310
<i>Abandoned as newborns,</i>

26:01.394 --> 26:04.522
<i>we'll wash and feed them,
then sell them to Japan.</i>

26:04.981 --> 26:06.816
<i>What meaningful work.</i>

26:06.899 --> 26:11.237
<i>Instead of starving, they grow up
to be rich gentlemen and ladies.</i>

26:12.321 --> 26:16.993
<i>Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid.
I wouldn't be so miserly.</i>

26:17.451 --> 26:22.415
<i>I wish my breasts gave milk.
I'd breastfeed all of them.</i>

26:31.882 --> 26:32.967
<i>Count!</i>

27:03.414 --> 27:06.459
I'll tell you the story of an interpreter,

27:07.710 --> 27:12.548
who bribed his way
into translating for high officials.

27:13.341 --> 27:17.637
After helping Japan annex Korea,
he got rights to a gold mine.

27:18.429 --> 27:20.598
<i>Now he wants to turn fully Japanese.</i>

27:22.224 --> 27:24.644
So he gets naturalized,

27:25.436 --> 27:28.522
marries the daughter
of a fallen Japanese noble,

27:29.065 --> 27:32.401
and adopts his wife's family name Kouzuki.

27:33.653 --> 27:37.907
Ba... bas...

27:37.990 --> 27:42.995
That bastard builds a mansion,
fills it with books and antiques.

27:44.955 --> 27:48.542
He invites Japanese collectors
to his library,

27:48.626 --> 27:52.672
<i>holds readings of rare books,
and auctions the books off.</i>

27:53.172 --> 27:56.050
He loves books and paintings
like his own flesh,

27:56.133 --> 27:57.551
<i>but he can't help parting with a few.</i>

27:58.052 --> 28:01.555
What to do, when he must sell,
but can't bear to?

28:01.639 --> 28:03.099
He sells a fake.

28:06.394 --> 28:11.148
He seeks out a specialist
to create intricate forgeries.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.943
Unlike him, this specialist...

28:14.026 --> 28:16.487
is a real Japanese of noble birth!

28:18.531 --> 28:21.450
Count Fujiwara from Nagoya.

28:23.285 --> 28:26.247
<i>So, who is this?</i>

28:27.707 --> 28:30.167
It's the wife. His Japanese wife.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.547
- You'll seduce her--
- Is she pretty?

28:34.630 --> 28:37.425
The Jap wife died ages ago
with no children.

28:38.092 --> 28:42.596
But the dead wife's
dead sister's living daughter

28:42.680 --> 28:44.140
performs those book readings.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.433
But is she pretty?

28:46.100 --> 28:48.102
She's an orphan. Her father was rich.

28:48.769 --> 28:52.481
Soon she'll fall in love with me,
and we'll elope to Japan.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.358
After marrying her there

28:54.900 --> 28:59.405
and inheriting her fortune,
I'll declare her insane

28:59.488 --> 29:01.449
and lock her up in a madhouse.

29:01.532 --> 29:02.742
<i>Right!</i>

29:03.701 --> 29:06.996
<i>Sookee will be my mouse,
work as her maid,</i>

29:07.079 --> 29:09.498
eavesdrop on her sleeptalking,

29:09.582 --> 29:11.083
and hand her over to me.

29:11.751 --> 29:16.672
Stay by her side during the day
and gently persuade her to fall in love.

29:17.339 --> 29:18.340
<i>Love?</i>

29:19.175 --> 29:20.801
<i>What does a crook know about love?</i>

29:26.849 --> 29:29.560
What about her fortune?
Is she rich for sure?

29:30.644 --> 29:34.315
<i>Every night in bed
I think of her assets.</i>

29:34.899 --> 29:37.610
<i>1.5 million in cash. 300,000 in bonds.</i>

29:40.988 --> 29:43.991
The uncle is just a guardian.
It's Hideko's fortune.

29:44.366 --> 29:47.787
That's why Kouzuki
schemes to marry the girl.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.539
To his w... wife's niece?

29:51.123 --> 29:52.333
What a s... sick f... f...

29:52.416 --> 29:54.001
Right, a sick fuck.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.297
So what's our share?

29:59.840 --> 30:01.425
I'll share 50,000.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.719
Sookee also gets
the dresses and jewellery.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.430
I'll do it! Take me!

30:06.514 --> 30:09.683
My Japanese is better,
and I've worked as a maid before!

30:23.447 --> 30:25.032
On top of the fifty,

30:27.284 --> 30:30.788
I get dresses, jewellery
and my own 100,000.

30:33.499 --> 30:36.794
B... b... beautiful!

30:36.877 --> 30:39.713
I... I... I'm utterly speechless
in your presence!

30:40.130 --> 30:44.593
If you stutter like that
and make your face go red,

30:45.052 --> 30:47.263
those uppity bitches will feel superior,

30:47.346 --> 30:49.348
and then they'll open up to you,
all right?

30:49.431 --> 30:51.141
Now, how to make your face go red.

30:51.225 --> 30:53.727
Listen carefully. Breathe in,

30:53.811 --> 30:56.021
pull in your stomach,

30:56.105 --> 30:59.066
pull your chin down
and tighten your butthole,

30:59.149 --> 31:01.443
then hold your breath
and swallow your saliva ten times.

31:01.944 --> 31:02.778
Get it?

31:04.154 --> 31:05.114
Let's just try it.

31:19.879 --> 31:23.340
Would you like to wear a navy kimono
with white peonies

31:23.424 --> 31:25.843
or a black kimono with cranes?

31:27.469 --> 31:30.055
Would you like to wear
a caterpillar patterned poop color

31:30.139 --> 31:32.558
or a poop patterned caterpillar color?

31:32.641 --> 31:36.353
<i>Don't ask! If you ask a question,
she'll start to think.</i>

31:36.854 --> 31:39.356
You think, and she doesn't.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.609
That's how you control the Miss.

31:41.692 --> 31:42.693
All right?

31:42.776 --> 31:43.611
All right.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.451
Here's the letter. Pay attention.

31:53.871 --> 31:55.831
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

31:55.915 --> 32:00.711
Count Fujiwara has informed me
of your urgent need for a maid.

32:01.295 --> 32:04.632
A maid is like a pair of chopsticks.

32:04.715 --> 32:09.011
Her presence is little noted, but
her absence causes much distress."

32:11.096 --> 32:14.808
<i>Did my mom cry before they hanged her?</i>

32:15.434 --> 32:17.603
<i>Women who stole once</i>

32:18.646 --> 32:21.899
and got hanged cried.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.692
They cried a lot.

32:26.028 --> 32:29.990
Your mother stole a thousand times,

32:30.074 --> 32:33.702
was caught just once and died once.

32:35.663 --> 32:36.789
Did she cry?

32:41.460 --> 32:42.753
She laughed.

32:43.754 --> 32:46.674
Said she was lucky
to have you before dying

32:46.757 --> 32:49.051
and that she had no regrets.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.598
You will surely become a brave thief.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.988
It should have been me!

33:10.406 --> 33:16.495
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.091
Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo,

33:29.842 --> 33:32.845
how you'll be an even greater thief
than your mother.

33:33.429 --> 33:35.556
Who believes the words of a swindler?

33:37.933 --> 33:41.395
When I give the signal,
"fully ripe",

33:41.478 --> 33:43.522
arrange for her and me to be alone.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.607
Then I'll gobble her up to the pit.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.944
She's so naive
she wouldn't know what a man wants

33:49.028 --> 33:51.405
even if he pulled on her nipples.

33:52.990 --> 33:54.616
<i>So it's your job to tell her</i>

33:54.700 --> 33:57.870
<i>that everything is because of me.</i>

33:58.370 --> 34:01.123
"Oh my, since the Count arrived,

34:01.206 --> 34:03.876
your toenails are growing much faster!"

34:05.085 --> 34:07.004
<i>That sort of thing, all right?</i>

34:08.547 --> 34:09.505
Here, a gift.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.228
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

34:25.856 --> 34:28.567
<i>That'll be mine
when she goes to the madhouse.</i>

34:29.610 --> 34:33.072
<i>It pains my heart to see this poor girl.</i>

34:33.155 --> 34:35.699
Have you ever seen sapphires so blue?

34:39.495 --> 34:41.121
Let's take a look...

34:43.373 --> 34:46.877
This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel.

34:50.297 --> 34:52.674
It's all right, Miss.
Spinels are expensive too.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.135
How do you know?

34:55.928 --> 35:00.099
Oh, my Auntie...
I mean, Lady Minami taught me.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.476
But it's fine!

35:02.559 --> 35:04.144
There's no need to be ashamed at all.

35:04.228 --> 35:06.814
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

35:06.897 --> 35:07.856
Is that so?

35:22.454 --> 35:25.290
<i>Of all the things
I've washed and dressed,</i>

35:26.125 --> 35:28.252
<i>has anything been this pretty?</i>

35:30.504 --> 35:32.798
<i>I'd like to show her
to the people at home.</i>

35:34.383 --> 35:35.676
<i>What would they say?</i>

35:38.178 --> 35:39.471
<i>Probably this?</i>

35:42.891 --> 35:44.059
Mesmerizing!

35:44.143 --> 35:47.813
S... spellbindingly beautiful!

35:54.319 --> 35:55.779
<i>He's shameless.</i>

36:00.492 --> 36:04.413
The Count kept offering me wine.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.546
<i>Does it feel okay?</i>

36:13.505 --> 36:16.758
It's suffocating.
How do ladies wear such things?

36:17.718 --> 36:19.219
You think this is suffocating?

36:20.804 --> 36:22.598
Miss, you're killing me!

36:26.476 --> 36:29.188
<i>Dressed up, you look like a lady too.</i>

36:33.984 --> 36:35.402
I think I know

36:37.237 --> 36:39.072
what the Count meant.

36:40.991 --> 36:42.242
Your face...

36:44.203 --> 36:45.662
Every night in bed,

36:47.080 --> 36:48.665
I think of your face.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.213
Don't be silly, Miss.

37:02.012 --> 37:04.389
<i>Ladies truly are the dolls of maids.</i>

37:05.766 --> 37:09.895
<i>All these buttons are for my amusement.</i>

37:11.063 --> 37:13.482
<i>If I undo the buttons
and pull out the cords,</i>

37:15.150 --> 37:18.528
<i>then the sweet things within,</i>

37:19.196 --> 37:21.531
<i>those sweet and soft things...</i>

37:23.951 --> 37:28.413
<i>If I were still a pickpocket
I'd slip my hand inside...</i>

38:01.697 --> 38:05.367
Miss, are you truly going
to marry your uncle?

38:09.121 --> 38:13.125
That's what he raised me for,
knowing he'd need my fortune.

38:14.251 --> 38:16.420
<i>There's a famous collector in France.</i>

38:16.503 --> 38:19.798
He'll be putting his entire library up
for auction.

38:19.881 --> 38:22.592
<i>The gold mine's proceeds
won't cover the cost.</i>

38:25.345 --> 38:29.016
If it were me, I'd sell books to buy gold,
not the opposite.

38:31.184 --> 38:34.396
Have you ever thought of
marrying someone else?

38:34.479 --> 38:36.189
<i>Like Count Fujiwara, for example--</i>

38:36.273 --> 38:39.568
You're very nosy for a handmaiden.

39:07.429 --> 39:08.889
<i>For now,</i>

39:09.306 --> 39:11.433
<i>the Lady needn't go read
to the sick fuck,</i>

39:11.516 --> 39:13.477
<i>who wants to marry his wife's niece.</i>

39:15.604 --> 39:19.941
<i>Instead the fake Count goes
to the Library to make fake books.</i>

39:23.945 --> 39:27.699
<i>The Lady waits for her
2 o'clock art class,</i>

39:27.783 --> 39:29.076
<i>and waits...</i>

39:31.453 --> 39:33.663
<i>Poor girl,</i>

39:33.747 --> 39:36.124
<i>losing her heart to a fake.</i>

40:10.784 --> 40:12.452
<i>Please, Count!</i>

41:05.797 --> 41:07.174
Sorry to be late.

41:07.883 --> 41:09.217
It's fine.

41:17.434 --> 41:21.730
Maybe I need more practice
to give it dimensionality.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.316
Dimensionality... perhaps.

41:24.399 --> 41:27.819
Nonetheless, you have a vision
that transcends mere skill.

41:28.403 --> 41:31.573
<i>It's as if you see directly
into an object's essence.</i>

41:32.574 --> 41:36.661
For example, the fact that this peach
contains a lot of water.

41:37.746 --> 41:40.207
I hesitate to stand before you,

41:40.290 --> 41:42.375
for fear that you might read my thoughts.

41:57.557 --> 41:58.850
That's enough for today.

42:05.774 --> 42:07.317
Almost fully ripe.

42:08.568 --> 42:09.402
<i>Already?</i>

42:14.199 --> 42:15.325
<i>Damn...</i>

42:19.412 --> 42:20.580
Do you know what?

42:20.664 --> 42:24.376
Since the Count arrived,
your cheeks have grown flushed.

42:24.459 --> 42:25.377
Have they?

42:31.925 --> 42:34.219
How did your mother die?

42:35.845 --> 42:40.767
When I was a baby,
at a big house, she was hanged...

42:40.850 --> 42:44.813
- I mean, she hanged--
- Hanged herself like my aunt, huh?

42:45.605 --> 42:47.357
Well, pretty much.

42:55.073 --> 42:59.286
She must have often hugged you
when she was alive, right?

43:03.748 --> 43:07.669
My mother died giving birth to me.

43:09.045 --> 43:15.552
So it's as if I strangled her myself.

43:17.554 --> 43:20.181
I wish I'd never been born.

43:24.561 --> 43:26.980
No baby is ever guilty of being born.

43:28.148 --> 43:30.442
If your mother thought
you could understand

43:30.525 --> 43:32.777
this is what she'd have said.

43:33.903 --> 43:37.198
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying,

43:38.283 --> 43:39.868
that she had no regrets.

43:46.916 --> 43:48.627
Wait here a moment, Miss.

43:50.170 --> 43:51.421
I'll go pick mushrooms.

43:53.673 --> 43:56.551
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

43:56.635 --> 43:58.136
I'll go with you.

43:59.304 --> 44:00.555
I'll be quick.

44:01.514 --> 44:02.557
Before it rains.

44:12.192 --> 44:13.026
Good girl--

44:18.365 --> 44:20.367
<i>What a coincidence.</i>

44:20.867 --> 44:22.035
<i>Indeed.</i>

44:22.494 --> 44:23.745
<i>May I sit next to you?</i>

44:51.022 --> 44:53.775
<i>The lady sits, shy and trembling.</i>

44:53.858 --> 44:56.695
<i>The gentleman is persistent.</i>

44:57.487 --> 45:01.157
<i>The perceptive maid
has stepped out for a moment.</i>

45:02.409 --> 45:04.661
<i>All is well, Sookee.</i>

45:05.453 --> 45:08.456
<i>Everyone's performing
their roles so damned well.</i>

45:10.458 --> 45:11.292
<i>Damn.</i>

45:17.132 --> 45:19.300
You know servants can't use this entrance!

45:28.143 --> 45:28.977
Hey!

45:34.649 --> 45:37.360
<i>I wish I'd never come here.</i>

45:40.196 --> 45:42.073
<i>It was wrong to come.</i>

45:43.908 --> 45:46.745
Tamako, you brought watercolors, right?

45:47.746 --> 45:49.581
Of course, milord!

45:49.664 --> 45:51.082
Watercolor paints and brushes--

45:51.166 --> 45:53.251
Go and get the oils.

45:53.334 --> 45:56.838
A day like this demands oils!

46:19.736 --> 46:20.779
Shit!

46:25.700 --> 46:27.327
Lady!

46:29.204 --> 46:30.747
Milord!

46:44.761 --> 46:45.762
Lady...

47:07.534 --> 47:10.119
<i>A blackout! Bring a lantern.</i>

47:28.763 --> 47:31.266
<i>I need to think.</i>

47:32.183 --> 47:34.102
<i>I need to become rich,</i>

47:34.477 --> 47:38.815
<i>sail off to a distant harbor,
eat food I scarcely recognize,</i>

47:38.898 --> 47:41.609
<i>buy my fill of glittering baubles,
and...</i>

47:42.277 --> 47:43.820
<i>not think of Hideko.</i>

47:45.405 --> 47:46.906
<i>Never think of Hideko--</i>

48:15.101 --> 48:17.145
<i>I returned
and you didn't even come to me.</i>

48:18.563 --> 48:21.149
It was late, I must have fallen asleep.
My apologies.

48:22.901 --> 48:25.737
You know how hard it is
to do those readings?

48:26.696 --> 48:29.699
Must I remove my makeup
and change all by myself?

48:30.909 --> 48:32.911
I feel a nightmare coming. Sleep here.

48:58.937 --> 49:00.563
He proposed to me.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.360
On the 15th,

49:06.945 --> 49:10.949
when my uncle visits his mine,
he wants to elope to Japan.

49:13.993 --> 49:15.662
What did you say?

49:18.665 --> 49:20.375
I said I wasn't sure.

49:20.458 --> 49:21.292
Why?

49:22.293 --> 49:23.127
I'm scared.

49:24.295 --> 49:25.546
Of your uncle's anger?

49:28.299 --> 49:29.133
Of the Count.

49:31.803 --> 49:34.389
What's to be scared of? He's so kind.

49:37.058 --> 49:39.018
I don't know, I just feel it.

49:43.272 --> 49:45.942
It's like the reflex of pulling
your hand back from a flame.

49:49.779 --> 49:50.905
Tell me...

49:59.664 --> 50:01.541
What is it that men want?

50:05.253 --> 50:06.087
Pardon?

50:07.463 --> 50:11.009
I mean after getting married, at night...

50:14.846 --> 50:17.724
How would I know?
I'm practically a child

50:17.807 --> 50:21.686
with no mother.
There's no one here to...

50:27.859 --> 50:28.735
First.

50:31.362 --> 50:32.905
I guess we'd kiss?

50:36.034 --> 50:36.868
And?

50:39.120 --> 50:40.580
He would hold you in his arms.

50:41.414 --> 50:42.248
Standing?

50:43.750 --> 50:46.919
Only when there's nowhere to lie down
or you're in a hurry.

50:47.003 --> 50:49.881
Normally you do it on the bed.

50:50.840 --> 50:52.592
You'll know when it happens.

50:52.675 --> 50:54.719
It's just like drinking
for the first time.

50:54.802 --> 50:55.970
When it happens?

50:59.807 --> 51:00.641
But...

51:01.559 --> 51:04.479
Could someone be like a blind person,

51:05.229 --> 51:09.108
not being able to feel it?

51:10.902 --> 51:12.153
<i>What the hell.</i>

51:12.779 --> 51:14.697
<i>I'll show her one thing
then put her to bed.</i>

51:17.492 --> 51:18.493
<i>Poor thing,</i>

51:18.576 --> 51:25.124
<i>alone in a strange country,
reading those useless books,</i>

51:25.875 --> 51:28.419
<i>without learning a single useful skill.</i>

51:46.104 --> 51:48.231
<i>Why does the candy taste different?</i>

51:49.899 --> 51:53.111
<i>The bitterness turns sour,</i>

51:53.194 --> 51:56.114
<i>the sourness turns sweet,</i>

51:56.739 --> 52:00.201
<i>the sweetness turns savoury...</i>

52:00.284 --> 52:01.786
How do you know all this?

52:03.162 --> 52:04.997
Do you have experience?

52:07.667 --> 52:10.753
My friend Kutan taught me.

52:11.420 --> 52:13.673
Taught you? With words?

52:13.756 --> 52:16.092
Yes, only with words.

52:35.486 --> 52:36.946
So this is how it feels.

52:37.488 --> 52:40.199
That's what you will feel for the Count.

52:41.284 --> 52:42.201
Really?

52:42.910 --> 52:44.579
The Count, truly...

52:47.665 --> 52:50.543
He won't think
he's making love to a corpse?

52:52.503 --> 52:54.839
You know about my cold hands and feet.

52:55.590 --> 52:56.674
Really?

52:57.425 --> 52:58.259
Here.

53:07.143 --> 53:08.853
It feels just fine.

53:09.395 --> 53:10.229
You like it?

53:12.273 --> 53:15.109
Do it to me. I want to know how it feels.

53:19.614 --> 53:23.826
I'm sure he'll want to do this too.

53:24.452 --> 53:25.536
And then...

53:32.585 --> 53:34.253
It's so cute.

53:36.881 --> 53:38.925
If the Count sees this...

53:49.352 --> 53:52.271
Will he really be as tender as this?

53:53.272 --> 53:54.440
Of course.

53:54.523 --> 53:57.360
He'll also touch you like this.

53:57.777 --> 53:58.611
<i>And like this...</i>

54:02.573 --> 54:04.867
Keep doing what the Count will.

54:08.079 --> 54:11.123
And this is what he'll say.

54:13.709 --> 54:17.004
"It's so soft, warm,

54:18.798 --> 54:20.549
wet, and...

54:21.259 --> 54:25.304
s... s... spellbindingly beautiful!"

54:45.700 --> 54:47.827
<i>Okju.</i>

54:49.412 --> 54:52.748
<i>Hideko.</i>

54:55.543 --> 54:57.920
<i>Mom.</i>

54:59.797 --> 55:02.008
<i>Dad.</i>

55:03.509 --> 55:06.137
Now, the model must stay still.

55:06.971 --> 55:10.683
<i>Okju.</i>

55:14.770 --> 55:18.399
<i>- Hideko...
- Wait.</i>

55:18.482 --> 55:19.900
<i>Stop!</i>

55:20.568 --> 55:24.196
<i>...doesn't like it,
you damned scoundrel!</i>

55:26.073 --> 55:27.158
<i>Stop it!</i>

55:27.241 --> 55:28.367
I can't do this.

55:32.496 --> 55:33.581
Come here, Tamako.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.420
Find something else to keep you busy.

55:39.503 --> 55:40.629
Do you know what I mean?

55:50.806 --> 55:52.767
I have nothing else to do.

55:52.850 --> 55:56.145
My job is to look after the Lady.

56:07.573 --> 56:10.659
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

56:10.743 --> 56:12.745
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

56:12.828 --> 56:14.455
If I miss this chance, I'm finished!

56:15.915 --> 56:18.292
Can you feel it?
How much I want it?

56:18.376 --> 56:23.339
After fighting so hard
to escape my garbage heap of a life,

56:23.422 --> 56:26.926
you think I'll let you ruin it, you bitch?

56:27.009 --> 56:32.264
Shall I tell the Lady
you're nothing but a lowly pickpocket?

56:32.348 --> 56:35.768
Fine, I'll have something to tell her too.

56:35.851 --> 56:39.897
That you're nothing but the son
of a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman--

56:39.980 --> 56:41.357
Sookee.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.484
Think of your family at home.

56:43.901 --> 56:47.613
Boksun raising babies with her bad back
and those two idiots.

56:47.696 --> 56:50.032
How will they feel
if you go home empty-handed?

56:50.408 --> 56:51.909
Want to ruin your mother's reputation?

56:52.368 --> 56:54.328
You should go home in glory.

56:59.875 --> 57:03.504
So don't push Hideko too hard.

57:03.587 --> 57:04.964
She's got no one on this earth.

57:05.047 --> 57:08.134
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

57:11.345 --> 57:12.721
And please...

57:14.265 --> 57:18.811
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

57:28.070 --> 57:28.904
Oh my.

57:29.947 --> 57:32.867
Your toenails have grown faster
since the Count arrived.

57:32.950 --> 57:34.452
How curious.

57:35.911 --> 57:39.874
Miss, doesn't it bother you not to know?

57:40.958 --> 57:43.919
How many ships sail on the wide sea,

57:44.753 --> 57:47.047
people leaving, people returning,

57:47.590 --> 57:49.800
those saying farewell
or welcoming people back.

57:50.301 --> 57:52.344
Where is the farthest you've traveled?

57:52.803 --> 57:53.888
The hill beyond the manor?

58:00.895 --> 58:05.065
My uncle will chase me wherever I go.

58:07.568 --> 58:09.820
This is how I lived my life.

58:12.364 --> 58:16.243
I could be content here,
if you are with me.

58:21.582 --> 58:24.126
<i>You can walk with me in new shoes,</i>

58:24.752 --> 58:26.420
<i>tell me stories,</i>

58:28.589 --> 58:32.301
and massage my feet.

58:34.803 --> 58:36.555
You're fortunate, Miss.

58:37.139 --> 58:40.601
The man who loves you
has the power to protect you.

58:41.060 --> 58:42.686
That's rare.

58:43.687 --> 58:47.775
But I'm not sure... if I love him.

58:49.109 --> 58:50.152
You do love him.

58:54.114 --> 58:55.491
How do you know?

58:57.284 --> 58:59.328
You stare out the window all day,

59:00.496 --> 59:02.581
turn in your sleep and sigh,

59:05.417 --> 59:06.752
and your toenails...

59:06.835 --> 59:08.546
What if I said I don't love him?

59:09.797 --> 59:12.675
What if I said that I love someone else?

59:14.176 --> 59:18.514
<i>I have no one on this earth...</i>

59:19.139 --> 59:21.308
Would you still want me to marry him?

59:25.396 --> 59:26.730
You will love him.

59:42.496 --> 59:43.706
<i>Miss!</i>

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:32.129
<i>In the end,</i>

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:36.050
<i>Hideko accepted the proposal,
provided that I go to Japan too.</i>

01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:38.594
<i>The Count, after feigning annoyance
for a bit,</i>

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:40.846
<i>nodded his head.</i>

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:44.808
<i>On the day her Uncle left
to visit his mine,</i>

01:00:44.892 --> 01:00:49.396
<i>the Count pretended to go back
to Japan and hid nearby.</i>

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:04.912
You'll have a week of freedom,

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:10.542
but always remember the basement.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:57.798
<i>Miss!</i>

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:05.824
<i>Thank you for traveling
on our ferry today.</i>

01:03:05.908 --> 01:03:11.371
<i>We will arrive at Shimonoseki
at 7:30 p.m.--</i>

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:19.797
We're finally going home.

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:23.592
- It's been three years...
- It's been a long time.

01:03:29.181 --> 01:03:31.350
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.174
To not steal...

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:48.468
To not steal...

01:04:48.844 --> 01:04:50.345
To not commit adultery...

01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:52.389
To not commit adultery...

01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:55.309
To not lie...

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.686
To not lie...

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:39.079
<i>Spider thread pulled into strings</i>

01:06:39.705 --> 01:06:44.001
<i>Strumming makes a zither sing</i>

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:47.421
<i>Thousand woes</i>

01:06:54.469 --> 01:07:01.309
<i>Under the blue sky
Only the crows cry</i>

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:07.024
<i>How sorrowful my zither</i>

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:10.694
<i>My beloved zither...</i>

01:07:21.163 --> 01:07:23.123
Did you sleep well?

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:34.468
Excuse me.

01:07:35.135 --> 01:07:36.636
Sorry.

01:07:41.433 --> 01:07:46.813
<i>The Count paid the innkeeper
to spy on us, afraid we might run off.</i>

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:49.900
Why get dressed?
I've nothing to do anyway.

01:07:52.277 --> 01:07:54.071
<i>Things are moving too slowly.</i>

01:07:54.154 --> 01:07:57.616
<i>I fear Hideko might truly go mad.</i>

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.368
Shall we play "maid", like before?

01:08:04.039 --> 01:08:07.584
<i>There is no sign of the Count
from morning to night.</i>

01:08:08.335 --> 01:08:12.339
<i>Certifying the marriage
and converting the inheritance to cash</i>

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:13.757
<i>require much work, he says.</i>

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.881
How could you be so cruel?

01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:58.301
You plucked the flower, now re-plant it.

01:08:58.385 --> 01:08:59.845
What do you want?

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:03.723
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:39.843
<i>After a week,</i>

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:51.520
<i>finally...</i>

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:39.694
This way.

01:10:46.493 --> 01:10:47.869
They're from the madhouse.

01:10:47.953 --> 01:10:49.162
You know what to say.

01:11:04.219 --> 01:11:05.595
Who is that person?

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:08.139
The Countess Lady Fujiwara.

01:11:08.223 --> 01:11:10.976
Her maiden name was Izumi Hideko.

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.646
And who might you be?

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:16.439
I am the Lady's handmaiden.

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:18.692
- What's your name?
- It's Tamako.

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:22.904
Then, what kind of treatment

01:11:23.655 --> 01:11:26.324
do you believe your Lady requires?

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:44.134
She should be confined in a place

01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:50.056
where no one can harm her
and where she can do no harm.

01:11:54.686 --> 01:11:59.524
Just a few tests, then let's have
lamb chops at the Peace Hotel.

01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:18.001
It's almost over. Good work.

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:21.880
Don't be frightened.

01:12:57.499 --> 01:12:59.584
<i>Good day, Countess.</i>

01:13:00.335 --> 01:13:01.920
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

01:13:05.465 --> 01:13:06.299
Countess?

01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:17.352
What is this?

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:20.355
We mean you no harm, Countess.

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:22.440
<i>We're going to look after you.</i>

01:13:23.858 --> 01:13:27.529
You've got the wrong person.
She is the Countess.

01:13:28.446 --> 01:13:30.323
Tell them, Your Lordship!

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:35.829
<i>She still believes
she's a Korean handmaiden.</i>

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:41.042
It's because her nanny was Korean.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:42.919
You scoundrel!

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:46.881
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

01:13:46.965 --> 01:13:50.593
<i>We do not use such language here,
your Ladyship.</i>

01:13:50.677 --> 01:13:51.970
Miss!

01:13:56.474 --> 01:14:00.895
My poor Lady, she's gone nuts.

01:14:01.855 --> 01:14:04.190
If it would be of any help,

01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:08.987
this is from her mother
and she used to cherish it

01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:12.365
before going mad.

01:14:16.828 --> 01:14:19.122
Such a considerate maid.

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:24.961
<i>You may have thought that
Hideko was a fool.</i>

01:14:26.087 --> 01:14:27.297
<i>A fool... maybe not.</i>

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:32.594
<i>I tell you, right from the start
Miss Izumi Hideko...</i>

01:14:35.597 --> 01:14:37.474
<i>had always been...</i>

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:38.975
Miss!

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:41.728
<i>...a rotten bitch.</i>

01:14:47.108 --> 01:14:47.942
PART TWO

01:14:48.026 --> 01:14:53.573
I'm not a rotten bitch!
No! No!

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:02.373
Put it in your mouth, Hideko.

01:15:05.752 --> 01:15:06.961
Hold out your hand.

01:15:26.064 --> 01:15:29.025
Next time you feel like talking back,

01:15:29.484 --> 01:15:32.779
remember the taste of this metal bead.

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:41.746
You'll sleep alone from tonight.

01:15:52.257 --> 01:15:54.592
- All right?
- Please give me a light.

01:15:54.968 --> 01:15:58.179
We've been ordered to save oil.

01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:00.431
You little brat.

01:16:00.515 --> 01:16:01.933
Speak Japanese!

01:16:04.811 --> 01:16:08.565
In there is a man the size of an ogre

01:16:08.648 --> 01:16:12.777
who can't stand
the sound of girls screaming.

01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:16.948
If he hears you, he'll burst
in through that door after you.

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:19.325
And then?

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:27.417
He'll smother you with his giant body,

01:16:27.834 --> 01:16:30.169
so you can't make a sound.

01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:45.602
Aunt.

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:47.979
My, my.

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:52.233
Scaring a little girl like that.

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:43.534
<i>And me?</i>

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:46.871
Am I pretty too?

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:52.293
Look closely.

01:17:57.423 --> 01:17:59.509
Everyone says I can't compare

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:04.138
to my big sister.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:07.684
<i>Day.</i>

01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:09.143
<i>Night.</i>

01:18:09.727 --> 01:18:10.561
<i>Day.</i>

01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:12.146
<i>Night.</i>

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:14.315
<i>Man.</i>

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:15.775
Woman.

01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:17.777
Man.

01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:19.362
Woman.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.574
Eye.

01:18:24.242 --> 01:18:25.243
Nose.

01:18:26.077 --> 01:18:27.161
Mouth.

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:28.788
Ear.

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:30.790
Shoulder.

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:32.667
Nipple.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.210
Navel.

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:35.837
Eye.

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:37.422
Nose.

01:18:37.922 --> 01:18:38.965
Mouth.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:40.633
Ear.

Shoulder.

01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:43.678

01:18:44.262 --> 01:18:45.304
Navel.

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:49.892
Penis.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:51.644
<i>Vagina.</i>

01:18:57.567 --> 01:18:59.777
<i>P... penis.</i>

01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:01.654
Vagina.

01:19:38.024 --> 01:19:41.235
Do you think I won't understand
if you speak Korean?

01:19:44.197 --> 01:19:48.743
<i>I was going a bit crazy and wanted
everyone else to go crazy too.</i>

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:56.501
<i>When Mrs. Sasaki
looked as crazy as I,</i>

01:19:56.584 --> 01:19:58.836
<i>life was more bearable.</i>

01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:20.983
I know you are a bit insane.

01:20:21.776 --> 01:20:25.029
It runs in your mother's family.

01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:28.533
That's why I'm training you,

01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:29.826
to set your mind right.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:35.164
If I fail, there's a place called
a "mental hospital" in Japan.

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:41.712
Established by rational Germans,

01:20:41.796 --> 01:20:45.633
it's very effective in treating lunacy.

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:49.929
They dig holes in the dirt,
put a patient in each one,

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:51.430
and put lids on top.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:54.058
When the patients get better,
they get a leash,

01:20:54.141 --> 01:20:57.979
so they can crawl around like dogs.

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:29.176
<i>The cherry tree that came with me
on the ship from Japan</i>

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.928
<i>bloomed twice.</i>

01:21:32.597 --> 01:21:35.725
"When Jinlian finally took off
her clothes,

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:39.020
Ximen-Qing-examined her-Jade-Gate...

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:42.857
To-find-it-hairless-as-white-as-snow
and-as-smooth-as-jade..."

01:21:45.526 --> 01:21:47.445
You must pause between words.

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:51.574
Don't read like a dog lapping
at his plate!

01:21:54.035 --> 01:21:56.871
Listen to your aunt read.

01:22:04.003 --> 01:22:08.674
"When Jinlian finally took off
her clothes,

01:22:08.758 --> 01:22:12.553
Ximen Qing examined her Jade Gate...

01:22:12.637 --> 01:22:14.055
DISCOVERING THE SECRET WELL

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:18.225
...to find it hairless, as white as snow,

01:22:18.643 --> 01:22:20.770
and as smooth as jade.

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:23.564
As tight as a drum,

01:22:24.065 --> 01:22:25.983
and as soft as silk.

01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:31.739
Once he drew apart the curtains of flesh,

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:38.579
a scent of well-aged wine
emanated from within,

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:45.169
and on fold upon fold
of the red velvet interior

01:22:45.586 --> 01:22:47.296
beads of dew were forming.

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:53.761
Its center was dark and void,

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:57.640
yet as if it had its own life,

01:22:58.224 --> 01:23:02.269
it twitched and twitched."

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:34.969
<i>Everyone wanted to cut it down,
but my uncle refused.</i>

01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:41.517
<i>He said this tree from Mt. Fuji
had absorbed my aunt's soul.</i>

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:48.107
<i>The servants whispered it was
due to the tree's high cost,</i>

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:50.943
<i>but I think my uncle was right.</i>

01:23:51.694 --> 01:23:54.155
<i>You can tell from the cherry blossoms,</i>

01:23:54.613 --> 01:23:57.616
<i>which turned brighter
and bloomed longer.</i>

01:24:31.108 --> 01:24:33.319
<i>"Tell me, Juliette.</i>

01:24:33.694 --> 01:24:37.156
Do you wish for
this impetuous young knight to save you?

01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:40.701
<i>The duchess shook her head resolutely,</i>

01:24:46.373 --> 01:24:53.380
to my great disappointment.

01:24:55.883 --> 01:24:56.926
Now,

01:24:57.968 --> 01:25:00.054
my brave knight."

01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:07.144
<i>Oh, it's a new face!</i>

01:25:10.648 --> 01:25:11.982
<i>Now,</i>

01:25:12.066 --> 01:25:13.943
<i>my brave knight.</i>

01:25:15.528 --> 01:25:21.992
<i>When you see these old scars
and the fresh pink wounds,</i>

01:25:22.076 --> 01:25:23.786
<i>what do you feel?</i>

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:29.834
I pity the poor woman.

01:25:29.917 --> 01:25:34.922
I wish to lick her and lick her,
caress her and caress her.

01:25:36.090 --> 01:25:38.300
If you pity her so,

01:25:39.135 --> 01:25:43.389
why not take her place
and let her whip you?

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:54.400
<i>The duchess raised the whip
high in the air, and then...</i>

01:26:02.449 --> 01:26:04.243
And again...

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:14.879
<i>My cock became painfully erect.</i>

01:26:20.801 --> 01:26:24.805
If she could be yours for ten minutes,

01:26:24.889 --> 01:26:26.724
what would you give in exchange?

01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:30.728
Whatever your heart desires.

01:26:31.228 --> 01:26:33.981
Anything in this whole wide world.

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:39.236
<i>Once the duke untied me,</i>

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.823
<i>I sat on the chair, pulled her to me,</i>

01:26:43.616 --> 01:26:47.745
and slid my cock into her cunt.

01:26:53.417 --> 01:26:56.420
<i>Oh, Juliette, Juliette...</i>

01:26:58.756 --> 01:27:03.594
<i>As I felt the duke approach from behind,</i>

01:27:03.677 --> 01:27:06.388
<i>a rope slithered around my neck.</i>

01:27:07.932 --> 01:27:10.684
<i>The duke slowly tightened the rope.</i>

01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:15.814
<i>Like a drowning man grasping at straws,</i>

01:27:15.898 --> 01:27:20.319
<i>I pulled the swirling currents
of her hair.</i>

01:27:21.487 --> 01:27:23.822
<i>Then the duke spoke.</i>

01:27:26.367 --> 01:27:28.953
<i>The ten minutes are almost up.</i>

01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:41.257
Slowly, my dear, said the Duchess...

01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:48.472
I haven't yet fully savored his pain.

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:57.982
No, the knight cried, don't stop!

01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:03.362
Please let me die

01:28:03.445 --> 01:28:05.614
in the midst of this pain.

01:28:06.073 --> 01:28:08.534
In this suffocating pain.

01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:53.579
Is it Sade?

01:28:54.413 --> 01:28:56.081
It's Sade-esque.

01:28:56.623 --> 01:29:01.670
It is believed to be the same Japanese man
who wrote <i>The Lizard Skin.</i>

01:29:02.463 --> 01:29:07.051
It was acquired from a Japanese sailor
on a ship from Hamburg.

01:29:17.102 --> 01:29:20.397
Cheap hair and shabby clothes,

01:29:21.065 --> 01:29:23.484
old and worn down,

01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:26.987
a body foul with food waste
and human secretion.

01:29:28.906 --> 01:29:33.410
Can you imagine my joy when

01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:38.082
after such a journey,

01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:42.961
it sat on my shelf with its brothers?

01:29:43.045 --> 01:29:44.380
Even compared with an unopened

01:29:44.463 --> 01:29:47.674
first-edition of Milton's,
it wouldn't be outstripped.

01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:50.427
That's right.

01:29:51.178 --> 01:29:56.016
These are the babes
to whom I feel the most affection.

01:29:57.309 --> 01:30:03.273
It used to contain an elaborate
monochrome woodcut illustration,

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:07.027
but as you can see...

01:30:07.111 --> 01:30:08.445
<i>So unfortunate.</i>

01:30:10.614 --> 01:30:14.785
If that were intact,
you could've named your price.

01:30:16.537 --> 01:30:20.916
The author felt words alone
could not fully describe the positions,

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:24.711
and so included an illustration.

01:30:26.088 --> 01:30:29.341
In that regard,
before we start the bidding...

01:30:30.259 --> 01:30:31.135
Hideko!

01:30:31.635 --> 01:30:33.720
Why don't you show us this scene?

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:15.137
PAIN IS A GARMENT

01:32:37.636 --> 01:32:39.012
<i>Beautiful!</i>

01:32:45.644 --> 01:32:47.771
See you again.

01:32:48.272 --> 01:32:50.524
Yes, thank you.

01:32:50.607 --> 01:32:53.443
Today's reading was outstanding.

01:32:54.111 --> 01:32:55.529
Yes, thank you.

01:32:56.238 --> 01:32:58.907
Especially the puppet!

01:33:27.185 --> 01:33:29.104
<i>You are of noble birth,</i>

01:33:29.187 --> 01:33:33.942
<i>yet you engage in the lowly work
of copying paintings.</i>

01:33:34.026 --> 01:33:37.279
There was a time

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:40.365
when I dissipated my wit and skills
on gambling.

01:33:40.866 --> 01:33:44.328
Imagine the torment
of having so many women

01:33:44.411 --> 01:33:46.121
make advances on me,

01:33:46.204 --> 01:33:48.915
when I couldn't afford
to buy them a glass of Burgundy.

01:33:50.667 --> 01:33:54.671
Do the women here make advances on you?

01:33:55.505 --> 01:33:57.424
I look at women's eyes,

01:33:57.507 --> 01:33:58.675
only the eyes.

01:33:59.509 --> 01:34:03.138
<i>They turn their gaze away,</i>

01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:05.724
<i>but then they always look back.</i>

01:34:06.099 --> 01:34:08.935
It's a silent exchange
of question and answer.

01:34:09.895 --> 01:34:14.858
If I were to slide
under someone's covers tonight,

01:34:14.941 --> 01:34:19.363
only one woman here would refuse me.

01:34:20.489 --> 01:34:22.240
<i>Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?</i>

01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:29.414
Is she not your former wife?

01:34:29.915 --> 01:34:32.751
You left her to marry a Japanese woman.

01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:36.755
But the servants tell me
you still share a bed with her.

01:34:39.257 --> 01:34:41.802
Can I ask you something?

01:34:44.971 --> 01:34:46.139
<i>Of course.</i>

01:34:47.557 --> 01:34:52.229
You went so far as to abandon your wife,
why this urge to become Japanese?

01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:56.566
Because Korea is ugly

01:34:57.025 --> 01:34:59.861
and Japan is beautiful.

01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:04.199
Some Japanese say Japan is ugly,

01:35:04.282 --> 01:35:05.784
and Korea is beautiful.

01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:08.787
Beauty is cruel by nature.

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:12.874
Korea is soft, slow, dull,
and therefore hopeless.

01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:18.630
Let's talk about that one woman
who would deny you.

01:35:22.008 --> 01:35:25.929
Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?

01:35:26.012 --> 01:35:28.014
Mrs. Sasaki...

01:35:30.308 --> 01:35:31.893
If I gave her the right signal,

01:35:31.977 --> 01:35:36.356
<i>she'd knock on my door
without her underwear.</i>

01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:46.116
My thoughts exactly.

01:35:48.285 --> 01:35:49.661
Then who is it?

01:35:50.245 --> 01:35:52.414
The one who would deny you?

01:35:54.916 --> 01:35:57.836
I heard you own the highest quality

01:35:57.919 --> 01:36:01.548
antique bookmaking tools
of the East and West,

01:36:02.382 --> 01:36:03.717
but I don't see them here.

01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:06.344
I'll show them to you later.

01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:13.643
Who is the one person to refuse you?

01:36:16.313 --> 01:36:21.026
I met Hideko's eyes by chance,
but she didn't look away.

01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:24.404
Indeed it was I, who shifted my gaze.

01:36:24.488 --> 01:36:25.572
<i>Hideko,</i>

01:36:26.198 --> 01:36:31.912
Will she make an appearance
in your lewd dreams tonight?

01:36:33.747 --> 01:36:36.833
<i>Even if honored with such a visit,</i>

01:36:37.417 --> 01:36:39.795
<i>I don't think I could consummate.</i>

01:36:40.337 --> 01:36:44.257
I would happily regret it
the moment I begin

01:36:44.758 --> 01:36:48.053
because her body
would be as cold as a waterfowl.

01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:55.685
That is the result of long training.

01:36:57.479 --> 01:37:00.816
<i>I heard you are engaged to her.</i>

01:37:04.986 --> 01:37:10.617
<i>If I'm not mistaken,
you are yet to have intercourse?</i>

01:37:11.743 --> 01:37:14.454
<i>Her eyes have no desire.</i>

01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:17.415
<i>It means her soul is dead inside.</i>

01:37:19.376 --> 01:37:21.127
<i>You should go easy on her training,</i>

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.298
<i>unless you enjoy making love
to a corpse.</i>

01:37:48.822 --> 01:37:50.282
Would you like a smoke?

01:37:58.957 --> 01:38:02.794
How did such a noble count

01:38:02.878 --> 01:38:07.048
fall into the grouty habit
of smoking cigarettes?

01:39:00.644 --> 01:39:04.272
This is my particular way
of possessing beauty.

01:39:05.899 --> 01:39:09.402
Hideko too must have received
painting lessons.

01:39:10.445 --> 01:39:12.113
No, she did not.

01:39:12.739 --> 01:39:17.035
I was too occupied teaching her
to read with correct diction.

01:39:18.286 --> 01:39:19.287
<i>Is that so?</i>

01:39:19.788 --> 01:39:21.957
In England, where I studied,

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:28.088
all ladies were expected to produce
vibrant color and graceful lines,

01:39:29.255 --> 01:39:31.299
even in the less noble families.

01:39:50.402 --> 01:39:52.529
You have a phone call, sir.

01:39:53.405 --> 01:39:55.198
At this hour?

01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:56.950
<i>It's the Iwamura Bookstore.</i>

01:39:57.951 --> 01:39:59.285
Is that so?

01:39:59.369 --> 01:40:01.329
Excuse me a moment.

01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:12.924
You are mesmerizing.

01:40:14.843 --> 01:40:17.637
Men use the word "mesmerizing"

01:40:17.721 --> 01:40:20.682
when they wish to touch a lady's breasts.

01:40:21.641 --> 01:40:25.228
I'm familiar
with Western conversational etiquette.

01:40:27.439 --> 01:40:30.275
I do a bit of reading, you know.

01:40:30.984 --> 01:40:32.902
There was no calculation in what I said.

01:40:33.486 --> 01:40:37.907
It was a reflex,
like pulling one's hand from a flame.

01:40:39.325 --> 01:40:40.368
I'm no flame.

01:40:41.119 --> 01:40:44.622
I'm cold as a waterfowl, your Lordship.

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:52.672
He will return soon.

01:40:52.756 --> 01:40:55.341
Mr. Iwamura only called
with a frivolous inquiry,

01:40:55.425 --> 01:40:57.469
at my request.

01:40:57.552 --> 01:41:01.181
There's an issue regarding
your future you should know.

01:41:01.264 --> 01:41:04.476
I'll wait by the stone lamp at midnight.

01:41:06.269 --> 01:41:09.397
<i>That Iwamura is a real fool.</i>

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:17.405
Good night, Miss.

01:42:28.810 --> 01:42:30.937
My maid is asleep in the room next door.

01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:33.314
I don't fancy being
in scandalous rumors with you.

01:42:33.398 --> 01:42:36.943
<i>I saw Junko go to the servants' quarters
with her pillow.</i>

01:42:37.026 --> 01:42:39.154
Consider your reputation as a nobleman.

01:42:39.779 --> 01:42:41.573
<i>I'm no nobleman.</i>

01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:43.449
<i>I'm not even Japanese.</i>

01:42:43.533 --> 01:42:46.119
<i>Do you think it was easy for
a Korean farmhand's son to reach here?</i>

01:42:47.245 --> 01:42:50.748
After fifteen hard years in Japan,
I heard some things about you.

01:42:51.249 --> 01:42:53.126
Another three years were spent to prepare.

01:42:53.793 --> 01:42:56.671
I studied bookmaking
and learned to paint forgeries.

01:42:57.505 --> 01:42:59.549
All so that I could meet you.

01:42:59.924 --> 01:43:01.467
To seduce and marry you,

01:43:01.551 --> 01:43:04.053
to possess your father's inheritance,

01:43:04.679 --> 01:43:06.306
and then probably to get rid of you.

01:43:08.433 --> 01:43:09.934
But I knew as soon as I met you.

01:43:10.518 --> 01:43:12.353
For a man to seduce you would be--

01:43:14.898 --> 01:43:15.982
...impossible.

01:43:17.775 --> 01:43:21.112
So in place of seduction,
I decided to propose a deal.

01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:26.075
Most marriages are like being imprisoned,
but this one will free you.

01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:28.745
I'll rescue you from here,

01:43:28.828 --> 01:43:32.290
take you far away, and give you freedom.

01:43:33.791 --> 01:43:35.960
Of course, we'll split the money.

01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:38.546
Nonsense.

01:43:39.589 --> 01:43:42.508
Does marrying an old man
with a black tongue

01:43:42.926 --> 01:43:44.052
at your tender age makes sense?

01:43:44.135 --> 01:43:46.262
I won't marry anyone.

01:43:46.346 --> 01:43:47.680
What have you in mind?

01:43:53.645 --> 01:43:55.104
That's not proper.

01:43:55.647 --> 01:43:56.814
There's no beauty in that.

01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.692
If you kill yourself,
what of your fortune?

01:44:00.443 --> 01:44:04.614
That will be the sum of your efforts?
Your fortune going to that pervert?

01:44:05.281 --> 01:44:08.576
So he can buy 10 little girls
and teach them to read books?

01:44:10.662 --> 01:44:12.872
My uncle will find us somehow.

01:44:13.289 --> 01:44:14.707
Then he'll take us to the basement.

01:44:15.833 --> 01:44:16.918
Uncle.

01:44:18.044 --> 01:44:18.962
The basement?

01:44:19.045 --> 01:44:22.340
<i>It says here when people are hanged,</i>

01:44:22.423 --> 01:44:27.178
their tongues stick out
and faeces is expelled.

01:44:28.304 --> 01:44:32.350
But that day, aunt's mouth was shut

01:44:33.142 --> 01:44:35.061
and her bottom was clean.

01:44:36.604 --> 01:44:38.690
Do you want to go somewhere nice?

01:44:56.457 --> 01:45:00.295
I'll tell you in detail
what I did to your aunt

01:45:00.378 --> 01:45:02.130
after I caught her running away.

01:45:02.755 --> 01:45:07.302
So don't you ever think of running,
understood?

01:45:25.403 --> 01:45:26.946
That day I just watched and listened.

01:45:27.697 --> 01:45:31.200
But if I ever end up there again...

01:45:35.997 --> 01:45:37.332
This is highly concentrated opium.

01:45:37.832 --> 01:45:39.667
Three drops will make you sleep all day.

01:45:40.084 --> 01:45:42.587
Five drops will knock down a horse.

01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:44.881
If you crave death within five minutes,

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.675
drink it all.

01:45:47.759 --> 01:45:51.095
If you carry this,
he can never take you to the basement.

01:45:51.179 --> 01:45:52.263
At least not alive.

01:45:53.431 --> 01:45:55.016
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

01:45:55.683 --> 01:45:57.393
It's more expensive than jewels.

01:46:09.072 --> 01:46:14.035
Bring a girl to be my maid.
One who could disappear and not be missed.

01:46:14.452 --> 01:46:16.162
<i>If a bit dense, all the better.</i>

01:46:16.245 --> 01:46:20.333
We'll send her to a madhouse
under my name.

01:46:22.752 --> 01:46:24.670
They dig a hole in the ground,

01:46:24.754 --> 01:46:27.590
put a patient in there and close the lid.

01:46:28.508 --> 01:46:31.094
I want my name to be buried in that hole.

01:46:32.136 --> 01:46:34.639
I can find you a new maid,

01:46:34.722 --> 01:46:36.933
but what do we do about Junko?

01:46:42.313 --> 01:46:47.276
You really think
I'm prettier than Miss Hideko?

01:46:48.694 --> 01:46:52.782
Sure, Hideko's pretty, and you're pretty.

01:46:52.865 --> 01:46:54.575
What? You speak Korean?

01:46:56.244 --> 01:46:57.703
You know...

01:46:58.788 --> 01:46:59.622
I learned it.

01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:02.583
To speak more easily with you.

01:47:04.377 --> 01:47:06.838
I really wanted to say this to you.

01:47:08.548 --> 01:47:10.091
You are just mesmerizing.

01:47:10.174 --> 01:47:11.592
Oh my gosh!

01:47:13.553 --> 01:47:15.138
You little tart!

01:47:20.268 --> 01:47:22.311
I can't!

01:47:22.687 --> 01:47:25.481
<i>If they catch me with a guest,
I'll be thrown out!</i>

01:47:26.607 --> 01:47:30.987
<i>Forget this wretched place.
Come live with me!</i>

01:48:18.034 --> 01:48:19.160
Oh, fucking hell!

01:48:20.077 --> 01:48:21.162
Fucking hell?

01:48:21.245 --> 01:48:22.622
Fucking hell...

01:49:13.548 --> 01:49:16.217
<i>The Count sent exactly what I ordered.</i>

01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:18.511
<i>Naive and a bit foolish.</i>

01:49:22.348 --> 01:49:24.600
We're alike, somehow.

01:49:25.309 --> 01:49:26.686
I heard you're an orphan, too.

01:49:30.982 --> 01:49:32.233
Mother!

01:49:43.494 --> 01:49:48.291
<i>Show Sookee your clothes
and jewellery at every opportunity.</i>

01:49:48.708 --> 01:49:53.087
<i>The material greed she got from her
mother will make her more gullible.</i>

01:49:53.170 --> 01:49:59.176
<i>P.S. Don't worry if she reads
this letter, she's totally illiterate.</i>

01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:00.761
Would you read it to me?

01:50:01.178 --> 01:50:02.263
Pardon?

01:50:03.431 --> 01:50:07.435
"...looking for a maid.
Maids are like...

01:50:08.519 --> 01:50:10.021
a spoon... no...

01:50:12.106 --> 01:50:14.567
are like chopsticks..."

01:50:18.487 --> 01:50:20.448
Is it a spoon?

01:50:20.531 --> 01:50:21.407
COUNTESS FUJIWARA HIDEKO

01:50:21.490 --> 01:50:24.285
This is your name. Can't you read it?

01:50:29.832 --> 01:50:31.167
What's with your foot?

01:50:35.713 --> 01:50:36.547
<i>Who did it?</i>

01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:39.342
<i>Who took Tamako 's shoe?</i>

01:50:46.724 --> 01:50:48.267
Apologize before all the servants!

01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:55.107
If she ever runs away
because of one of you,

01:50:55.191 --> 01:50:57.068
I'll strip you all naked
and throw you out!

01:50:58.861 --> 01:50:59.820
Fucking hell.

01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:05.785
All smooth.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.210
Do you like the scent?

01:51:15.252 --> 01:51:16.879
Do you want to come in?

01:51:16.962 --> 01:51:17.797
Pardon?

01:51:38.359 --> 01:51:39.944
<i>This must be Okju.</i>

01:51:40.027 --> 01:51:42.947
At your service, milord.

01:51:43.864 --> 01:51:47.451
<i>You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position.</i>

01:51:52.581 --> 01:51:56.210
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

01:51:59.672 --> 01:52:04.093
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

01:52:07.805 --> 01:52:10.558
- What?
- <i>Thank you for introducing her.</i>

01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:15.646
You found the perfect maid for me.

01:52:16.731 --> 01:52:20.401
<i>It was tough looking for one
that wasn't chubby.</i>

01:52:21.193 --> 01:52:24.447
<i>Take care of the lonely lady.</i>

01:52:25.114 --> 01:52:25.948
<i>Here.</i>

01:52:28.993 --> 01:52:31.912
<i>Becoming the lady's friend</i>

01:52:31.996 --> 01:52:33.873
<i>and getting paid for it</i>

01:52:34.331 --> 01:52:35.750
<i>is nothing to be ashamed of.</i>

01:52:38.419 --> 01:52:40.171
<i>Isn't that right, Miss?</i>

01:52:42.298 --> 01:52:43.966
There's no need to be ashamed at all.

01:52:44.049 --> 01:52:46.343
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

01:52:46.427 --> 01:52:48.429
Is that so?

01:52:53.976 --> 01:52:55.978
<i>"I'm returning the earrings
you loaned me.</i>

01:52:56.562 --> 01:52:59.440
<i>A woman might wager her fate
on such an exquisite pair.</i>

01:53:00.649 --> 01:53:03.319
<i>I'm sure that
Sookee will try her very best</i>

01:53:03.402 --> 01:53:07.782
<i>in order to see herself
wearing these in the mirror.</i>

01:53:08.616 --> 01:53:12.119
I'll tell you how to keep her
from getting suspicious.

01:53:12.203 --> 01:53:15.331
Keep her busy
until the day of the wedding.

01:53:15.831 --> 01:53:17.958
Make her spend all her energy

01:53:18.042 --> 01:53:20.377
on making you fall in love with me."

01:53:22.296 --> 01:53:25.633
In other words,
don't fall in love with me so easily.

01:53:36.477 --> 01:53:37.311
Mesmerizing!

01:53:40.689 --> 01:53:41.524
Me?

01:53:50.699 --> 01:53:53.160
Dressed up, you look like a lady too.

01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:03.128
Almost fully ripe.

01:54:12.888 --> 01:54:15.307
How did your mother die?

01:54:15.808 --> 01:54:19.186
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:22.064
That she had no regrets.

01:54:23.482 --> 01:54:27.570
<i>Is this the companionship
they write about in books?</i>

01:54:30.531 --> 01:54:31.574
<i>I'll go pick mushrooms.</i>

01:54:31.657 --> 01:54:35.452
<i>We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.</i>

01:54:35.536 --> 01:54:36.912
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

01:54:37.872 --> 01:54:38.706
I'll be quick.

01:54:38.789 --> 01:54:39.790
Before it rains.

01:54:53.512 --> 01:54:55.764
<i>What's with her?</i>

01:55:04.231 --> 01:55:05.774
Men are disgusting.

01:55:06.275 --> 01:55:09.153
How can they be so single-minded?

01:55:09.737 --> 01:55:10.905
What's on my mind?

01:55:12.197 --> 01:55:15.451
You don't really believe
that I crave your body, do you?

01:55:17.578 --> 01:55:18.704
You do!

01:55:18.787 --> 01:55:20.414
You read too many of those books.

01:55:20.497 --> 01:55:22.291
If there's one thing I'm after, Miss...

01:55:23.542 --> 01:55:28.547
It's not your eyes, your hands or ass,

01:55:28.923 --> 01:55:31.508
it's your money, only that.

01:55:32.051 --> 01:55:34.094
Of all that you have, money is the best.

01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:39.725
It feels great being so rude
to a noble lady.

01:55:40.476 --> 01:55:42.061
<i>What's with her?</i>

01:55:42.728 --> 01:55:46.565
<i>Why does she stomp her feet,
expressing her anger,</i>

01:55:46.982 --> 01:55:49.443
<i>sit up in the middle of the night
and sigh?</i>

01:55:51.236 --> 01:55:55.324
<i>Every time she sees the Count,
her eyes seem to say,</i>

01:55:56.116 --> 01:55:57.368
I despise you.

01:55:58.661 --> 01:56:00.162
<i>Try to bear it.</i>

01:56:00.245 --> 01:56:03.457
Only if she sees this
will she believe the proposal.

01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:27.106
Think of me as that puppet,
and I'll imagine another woman.

01:56:27.564 --> 01:56:29.608
What woman?

01:56:32.194 --> 01:56:33.612
The duchess Juliette.

01:56:36.573 --> 01:56:38.242
<i>Lady!</i>

01:56:38.993 --> 01:56:40.494
<i>Milord!</i>

01:56:46.208 --> 01:56:47.543
Lady...

01:56:52.965 --> 01:56:56.552
<i>"The lady's emotions lay deep inside...</i>

01:56:57.177 --> 01:56:59.680
<i>Jinlian could not fathom their depths.</i>

01:57:01.724 --> 01:57:03.809
<i>Knowing this, Lady Sun</i>

01:57:03.892 --> 01:57:08.022
<i>gave Jinlian four small silver balls.</i>

01:57:08.105 --> 01:57:12.609
These are 'minling',
or 'bells of passion'.

01:57:12.693 --> 01:57:16.071
<i>Place two in the lady's Jade Gate,</i>

01:57:16.488 --> 01:57:19.700
<i>and the other two in yours.</i>

01:57:22.202 --> 01:57:24.204
<i>Spread your legs apart</i>

01:57:24.288 --> 01:57:26.790
<i>and like two scissors</i>

01:57:26.874 --> 01:57:29.001
<i>trying to cut each other,
put them together.</i>

01:57:29.376 --> 01:57:32.171
<i>When the lips below rub
against each another,</i>

01:57:32.254 --> 01:57:34.298
<i>you'll hear a clear ringing sound."</i>

01:57:34.381 --> 01:57:36.508
<i>A blackout! Bring a lantern!</i>

01:57:36.592 --> 01:57:38.135
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

01:57:38.218 --> 01:57:41.346
THE SOUND OF BELLS
ON A WINDLESS NIGHT

01:57:43.182 --> 01:57:47.394
"'When do I put this in?'
asked Jinlian.

01:57:48.228 --> 01:57:52.691
Does the lady breathe deeply
and swallow hard?

01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:57.237
<i>Does she whisper sweetly in your ear,</i>

01:57:57.321 --> 01:57:59.198
<i>and kiss you?</i>

01:58:04.161 --> 01:58:06.246
Does she embrace you tightly

01:58:06.330 --> 01:58:08.248
and caress your nipples?

01:58:10.667 --> 01:58:15.214
Does her secret part become slippery

01:58:16.507 --> 01:58:23.138
as she gently bites your shoulder?

01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:27.851
<i>Then, put in the bells."</i>

01:58:32.606 --> 01:58:34.983
<i>- Amazing!
- Indeed!</i>

01:58:54.253 --> 01:58:56.088
It's so cute.

01:59:01.885 --> 01:59:03.470
If the Count sees this...

01:59:10.894 --> 01:59:13.272
Will he really be as tender as this?

01:59:14.773 --> 01:59:16.024
Of course.

01:59:16.108 --> 01:59:19.027
And he'll touch you like this...

01:59:20.028 --> 01:59:21.155
And like this...

01:59:29.913 --> 01:59:31.707
Tamako, keep doing

01:59:32.791 --> 01:59:34.418
what the Count will.

01:59:37.171 --> 01:59:38.338
The Count...

01:59:38.839 --> 01:59:40.632
The Count...

01:59:40.716 --> 01:59:43.302
He'll go crazy over this.

01:59:45.637 --> 01:59:49.099
And this is what he'll say.

01:59:51.351 --> 01:59:57.107
<i>"It's so soft, warm, wet, and...</i>

02:00:01.111 --> 02:00:05.240
<i>s... s... spellbindingly beautiful!"</i>

02:00:37.147 --> 02:00:40.067
Shall I teach you more, Miss?

02:00:40.150 --> 02:00:42.527
Yes...

02:00:43.111 --> 02:00:44.571
Teach me everything.

02:01:29.533 --> 02:01:33.870
I wish that I had breast milk
so I could feed you.

02:01:48.844 --> 02:01:50.595
Do you like it when I do this?

02:01:52.264 --> 02:01:53.598
Do you like me?

02:01:55.517 --> 02:01:58.270
Can you promise that you won't betray me?

02:01:59.938 --> 02:02:01.857
I'll never...

02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:02.858
never...

02:02:04.234 --> 02:02:05.235
ever...

02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:25.756
Miss, how could such an innocent...

02:02:26.173 --> 02:02:27.883
You must be a natural.

02:03:24.022 --> 02:03:24.856
Stop!

02:03:27.484 --> 02:03:30.153
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

02:03:30.987 --> 02:03:32.656
<i>She's got no one on this earth.</i>

02:03:32.739 --> 02:03:36.076
<i>If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.</i>

02:03:36.159 --> 02:03:37.702
<i>And please...</i>

02:03:38.161 --> 02:03:43.125
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

02:03:50.215 --> 02:03:51.216
<i>You see?</i>

02:03:52.843 --> 02:03:55.512
If you don't give the impression
you want this marriage,

02:03:55.595 --> 02:03:58.849
she may throw another fit
and refuse to go forward.

02:03:58.932 --> 02:04:02.060
Be more convincing
when you pretend to love me.

02:04:02.144 --> 02:04:03.228
I can't do it.

02:04:03.603 --> 02:04:04.438
What?

02:04:05.188 --> 02:04:06.523
I want to quit.

02:04:08.692 --> 02:04:09.860
What's with you all today?

02:04:11.570 --> 02:04:12.487
Why?

02:04:13.613 --> 02:04:15.615
I hate everyone.
My mom, dad, aunt, uncle,

02:04:15.699 --> 02:04:16.950
you and...

02:04:22.831 --> 02:04:24.332
I don't like Sookee, either.

02:04:24.416 --> 02:04:26.001
You feel sorry for her?

02:04:29.379 --> 02:04:31.381
What is it with women?

02:04:34.593 --> 02:04:38.180
You know what that poor Sookee said
about your Ladyship?

02:04:38.763 --> 02:04:42.350
That you're too naive to get it
even if someone pulls on your nipples.

02:04:42.434 --> 02:04:45.353
<i>That she was nice out of pity,
but you ate it up.</i>

02:04:45.437 --> 02:04:47.147
<i>That you were so gullible!</i>

02:04:47.230 --> 02:04:50.859
<i>That naive servant's face...</i>

02:04:50.942 --> 02:04:53.278
Yes... you will love him.

02:04:53.361 --> 02:04:56.406
If I say that I love someone else...

02:04:57.824 --> 02:05:02.162
I have no one on this earth...

02:05:02.746 --> 02:05:05.165
Would you still want me to marry him?

02:05:05.582 --> 02:05:06.416
Yes.

02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:19.137
<i>Miss!</i>

02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:44.412
<i>I wish I'd never been born.</i>

02:06:16.736 --> 02:06:19.948
<i>I wish I'd never been born.</i>

02:06:39.884 --> 02:06:40.885
Let go.

02:06:43.638 --> 02:06:46.683
Miss, I'm sorry!

02:06:49.311 --> 02:06:50.145
Let go!

02:06:50.812 --> 02:06:52.731
I'm sorry, Miss!

02:06:53.106 --> 02:06:54.608
Don't die.

02:06:54.691 --> 02:06:56.901
I'm sorry.

02:06:58.862 --> 02:07:00.196
<i>What are you sorry about?</i>

02:07:02.198 --> 02:07:06.786
I tried to trick you
into marrying that bastard.

02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:09.914
I was going to put you
in a madhouse and run off.

02:07:11.333 --> 02:07:15.253
Don't die. Don't get married, Miss!

02:07:17.547 --> 02:07:21.009
Sookee, are you worried about me?

02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:28.266
I'm worried about you.

02:07:33.730 --> 02:07:36.399
How do you know my name?

02:07:37.859 --> 02:07:39.986
You think you're tricking me?

02:07:42.614 --> 02:07:43.990
You're the one being tricked.

02:07:45.659 --> 02:07:47.869
You're the one bound for the madhouse.

02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:52.540
<i>I was going to lock you up
in there under my name,</i>

02:07:53.291 --> 02:07:56.169
then I'd become you
and run far away with him.

02:08:01.257 --> 02:08:04.719
I won't say sorry,
since you tried to trick me too.

02:08:12.018 --> 02:08:14.521
That fucking son of a bitch!

02:08:16.981 --> 02:08:19.984
Oh, sorry Miss!

02:08:20.902 --> 02:08:25.156
<i>"I hope this letter finds you well.
This is Sookee.</i>

02:08:25.615 --> 02:08:30.078
<i>I'm writing to inform you
of a change in plans.</i>

02:08:30.161 --> 02:08:35.375
<i>I decided to team up
with the Lady Hideko.</i>

02:08:35.458 --> 02:08:38.753
<i>As such, I'm now in need
of all your help.</i>

02:08:38.837 --> 02:08:41.840
<i>I'm enclosing an item
as advance payment."</i>

02:08:41.923 --> 02:08:46.302
Always remember the basement.

02:09:00.650 --> 02:09:02.610
Do you want to go somewhere nice?

02:09:46.529 --> 02:09:48.823
<i>You didn't teach me to read Japanese.</i>

02:10:11.387 --> 02:10:13.348
Did that bastard draw this?

02:10:15.850 --> 02:10:20.814
Is this what you've been reading
to that dirty old man

02:10:21.314 --> 02:10:22.690
and those gentlemen?

02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:32.570
<i>The daughter of a legendary thief,</i>

02:12:32.654 --> 02:12:34.864
<i>who sewed winter coats
out of stolen purses,</i>

02:12:34.948 --> 02:12:38.117
<i>who was a thief, pickpocket
and swindler.</i>

02:12:39.285 --> 02:12:41.788
<i>She is the savior who came
to tear my life apart.</i>

02:12:42.413 --> 02:12:43.915
<i>My Tamako.</i>

02:12:44.791 --> 02:12:45.792
<i>My Sookee.</i>

02:14:07.415 --> 02:14:09.333
<i>How cruel can you be?</i>

02:14:09.417 --> 02:14:12.670
<i>You plucked the flower, now re-plant it.</i>

02:14:12.754 --> 02:14:14.756
<i>What do you want?</i>

02:14:14.839 --> 02:14:17.967
<i>Hurry up and throw her
into the madhouse!</i>

02:14:23.431 --> 02:14:24.932
You scoundrel!

02:14:25.433 --> 02:14:27.685
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

02:14:29.228 --> 02:14:30.646
Miss!

02:14:31.147 --> 02:14:32.648
Let go!

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:35.777
Miss!

02:14:50.917 --> 02:14:51.918
I'm hungry.

02:14:56.589 --> 02:15:01.135
<i>The first month,
I ordered a slim herringbone suit.</i>

02:15:01.844 --> 02:15:04.889
The next month,
I wore it to dine at the Imperial Hotel.

02:15:04.972 --> 02:15:05.807
PART THREE

02:15:05.890 --> 02:15:08.810
Me, a colonial boy working
as a tout at a brothel.

02:15:08.893 --> 02:15:11.979
Some Englishmen who frequented the brothel
recognized me.

02:15:12.063 --> 02:15:15.650
I thought they'd call the maitre d'
and kick me out,

02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:17.443
but what do you know?

02:15:18.402 --> 02:15:22.782
They were amused I'd spend a month's pay

02:15:22.865 --> 02:15:24.325
on one dignified meal.

02:15:25.451 --> 02:15:27.745
<i>They started calling me "Count"</i>

02:15:27.829 --> 02:15:29.664
<i>and taught me manners
to go with the name.</i>

02:15:29.747 --> 02:15:31.749
<i>Frankly, I'm not that
interested in money itself.</i>

02:15:32.333 --> 02:15:34.585
What I desire is, how shall I put it...

02:15:35.753 --> 02:15:38.256
The manner of ordering wine
without looking at the price?

02:15:38.714 --> 02:15:39.924
Something like that.

02:15:51.936 --> 02:15:54.438
<i>Fourteen hours by train from Vladivostok</i>

02:15:54.522 --> 02:15:56.524
<i>is the summer home
of a genuine Russian noble family.</i>

02:15:56.607 --> 02:15:58.484
<i>All the furniture is set</i>

02:15:58.568 --> 02:16:00.945
along with ankle-deep carpets.

02:16:08.369 --> 02:16:09.704
Shall we marry there?

02:16:15.168 --> 02:16:17.420
<i>In a few days,
I'll hear from the hospital.</i>

02:16:19.338 --> 02:16:22.008
<i>That my wife Fujiwara Hideko
has died.</i>

02:16:26.053 --> 02:16:28.681
You didn't just ask them to keep her?

02:16:29.599 --> 02:16:32.894
I doubt Sookee would want
to live there very long.

02:16:41.611 --> 02:16:42.653
Fuck!

02:16:47.617 --> 02:16:49.243
<i>Bastard.</i>

02:16:49.326 --> 02:16:52.746
I never said I wasn't a bastard.

02:16:54.373 --> 02:16:58.628
<i>You'll become a colonial girl
named Nam Sookee.</i>

02:16:58.710 --> 02:17:00.671
You know I'm an expert
at document forgery, right?

02:17:00.754 --> 02:17:02.715
I arranged it with a photography studio.

02:17:03.966 --> 02:17:07.719
From tomorrow,
we'll give Sookee a new life.

02:17:07.803 --> 02:17:09.096
I'm glad.

02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:10.848
<i>Marry me once again.</i>

02:17:11.849 --> 02:17:13.433
This time as Nam Sookee.

02:17:15.436 --> 02:17:17.355
You want another wedding night?

02:17:23.778 --> 02:17:26.906
I think I slightly like you.

02:17:30.409 --> 02:17:32.662
Poor Sookee, in a place like that

02:17:33.955 --> 02:17:35.790
all by herself...

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.087
Did such a thought ever cross your mind?

02:17:41.545 --> 02:17:43.673
Not at all. Why should I pity her?

02:17:44.173 --> 02:17:46.717
Where I come from,
it's illegal to be naive.

02:17:47.468 --> 02:17:50.972
Where you come from, it's not naive
to fall in love with a business partner?

02:17:51.055 --> 02:17:53.139
Of course. It's illegal.

02:17:53.641 --> 02:17:56.977
So even if my love for you
leads me to ruin,

02:17:57.561 --> 02:17:58.980
don't pity me.

02:17:59.772 --> 02:18:00.606
<i>Love?</i>

02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:04.693
What does a crook know about love?

02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:30.093
Fire!

02:18:39.687 --> 02:18:42.022
C... c... come this way!

02:18:42.106 --> 02:18:44.483
This way!

02:19:53.761 --> 02:19:56.597
Because you desired me,

02:19:56.680 --> 02:19:58.933
and overcame all obstacles to reach me,

02:19:59.016 --> 02:20:00.976
I have been born anew, it's true.

02:20:02.561 --> 02:20:04.230
I'm grateful for that.

02:20:06.607 --> 02:20:08.484
I'll allow a kiss.

02:20:13.572 --> 02:20:14.407
No.

02:20:14.824 --> 02:20:15.658
Why not?

02:20:19.036 --> 02:20:21.080
I don't like kisses with conditions.

02:20:21.163 --> 02:20:23.791
I never learned how to stop halfway.

02:20:26.043 --> 02:20:31.382
After this I'll thrust in deep,
to your navel.

02:20:32.466 --> 02:20:33.968
Please do that.

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:39.223
Those aren't the eyes of one who wants it.

02:20:39.807 --> 02:20:42.435
<i>You know you can't deceive me
in such matters.</i>

02:20:47.606 --> 02:20:51.694
If I could be yours for ten minutes,

02:20:51.777 --> 02:20:53.028
what would you give in exchange?

02:20:54.405 --> 02:20:56.699
Whatever your heart desires.

02:20:56.782 --> 02:20:59.076
Anything in this whole wide world.

02:21:23.934 --> 02:21:25.561
There's much I want to teach you.

02:21:27.563 --> 02:21:30.316
You'll become a completely new woman.

02:23:21.927 --> 02:23:24.847
It won't hurt.
You've seen it in those books.

02:23:24.930 --> 02:23:28.767
In truth, women feel the greatest pleasure

02:23:28.851 --> 02:23:30.519
when taken by force.

02:23:31.061 --> 02:23:33.856
Now I'm going to rip your underwear.

02:25:51.952 --> 02:25:54.079
Would you fetch those for me?

02:26:04.089 --> 02:26:07.009
Okay, here we go.

02:26:07.092 --> 02:26:09.011
One, two, three.

02:26:50.511 --> 02:26:52.471
<i>Respected Uncle,</i>

02:26:53.555 --> 02:26:55.390
<i>it always pained me</i>

02:26:55.849 --> 02:26:58.560
<i>to see you straining
to speak flawless Japanese</i>

02:26:58.644 --> 02:27:03.190
<i>before the Count from Nagoya
and even to quiver your voice</i>

02:27:03.273 --> 02:27:06.360
<i>like a nobleman.</i>

02:27:08.695 --> 02:27:14.743
<i>So I'm happy to inform you
that you no longer need do so.</i>

02:27:15.911 --> 02:27:20.541
<i>That man is the son
of a Korean farmhand.</i>

02:27:21.542 --> 02:27:25.879
<i>Oh, did my gift arrive safely?</i>

02:27:26.964 --> 02:27:30.592
<i>Please tell this to my gift, in Korean.</i>

02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:33.262
<i>I'm afraid that in real life,</i>

02:27:34.346 --> 02:27:37.641
<i>no woman feels pleasure
at being taken by force.</i>

02:27:38.058 --> 02:27:43.522
<i>But, for sending me Sookee
out of all the girls in the world,</i>

02:27:43.605 --> 02:27:45.732
<i>I feel "slightly" grateful.</i>

02:27:59.329 --> 02:28:02.666
You wished to see my bookmaking tools?

02:28:03.292 --> 02:28:06.587
Don't just look,
experience them for yourself.

02:28:07.588 --> 02:28:09.381
I'll choose five books that I cherish...

02:28:10.090 --> 02:28:12.718
that I used to cherish more than anything.

02:28:15.012 --> 02:28:17.180
Let's see... First,

02:28:20.267 --> 02:28:22.352
<i>Confessions of a Whip</i>

02:28:31.153 --> 02:28:32.446
<i>The Lizard Skin</i>

02:28:44.958 --> 02:28:48.629
<i>Decadent Girls Who Sell Lingerie</i>

02:28:57.971 --> 02:29:00.682
May I please smoke a cigarette, sir?

02:29:01.767 --> 02:29:02.601
Sir.

02:29:05.771 --> 02:29:06.980
<i>Bells and Balls</i>

02:29:11.318 --> 02:29:12.945
<i>The Mortician's Bedroom</i>

02:29:25.457 --> 02:29:28.085
How could you let a little girl fool you?

02:29:31.463 --> 02:29:35.968
<i>But don't worry.
I'll catch them for you soon.</i>

02:29:41.348 --> 02:29:44.101
I'll bind books with the skin
of those two bitches and you

02:29:44.184 --> 02:29:48.230
and place them on the shelf.

02:29:49.606 --> 02:29:54.861
I arranged so that no two girls
traveling together can leave Kobe.

02:29:57.698 --> 02:29:59.866
Please change the destination to Shanghai.

02:30:00.283 --> 02:30:03.370
Changing two tickets,
from Vladivostok to Shanghai.

02:30:03.453 --> 02:30:05.205
Yes, that's correct.

02:30:05.998 --> 02:30:06.957
<i>Show me your passports.</i>

02:30:14.673 --> 02:30:16.133
Miss Nam Sookee?

02:30:19.553 --> 02:30:20.762
<i>Mr. Go Pan-dol?</i>

02:30:29.396 --> 02:30:31.857
You need to pay an additional 3 yen.

02:30:32.482 --> 02:30:33.316
All right.

02:30:37.988 --> 02:30:43.076
Hideko is a peach
that I left on the branch,

02:30:43.744 --> 02:30:46.163
imagining what the taste will be like.

02:30:46.955 --> 02:30:49.833
Would I have plucked it someday?

02:30:50.500 --> 02:30:51.334
No.

02:30:52.627 --> 02:30:57.007
I'm just an old man
who likes dirty stories.

02:30:58.884 --> 02:31:02.012
Even listening to the same story,
people imagine different things.

02:31:03.013 --> 02:31:06.016
Peering into each of those fantasies

02:31:06.558 --> 02:31:09.519
was this old man's humble recreation.

02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:13.106
What to do, now that it's all over?

02:31:13.774 --> 02:31:16.151
You should at least tell me your story.

02:31:17.986 --> 02:31:21.198
<i>How did that bitch Hideko taste?</i>

02:31:22.282 --> 02:31:25.243
Was she fully ripe?
Tell me.

02:31:28.246 --> 02:31:30.624
A cigarette might help my memory.

02:31:31.792 --> 02:31:34.044
Right, right...

02:31:34.836 --> 02:31:38.590
You have that silly penchant
for cigarettes?

02:31:55.607 --> 02:31:59.319
So how was Hideko?

02:32:05.617 --> 02:32:09.412
You have no windows here.

02:32:13.166 --> 02:32:16.169
Sookee could be listening in.
Let's do our best.

02:32:28.265 --> 02:32:29.516
<i>That's it, good.</i>

02:32:42.028 --> 02:32:43.738
<i>What's this?</i>

02:32:43.822 --> 02:32:46.199
You can't stop there, dear fellow.

02:32:46.283 --> 02:32:48.618
So, where did you touch first?

02:32:49.077 --> 02:32:49.911
<i>Her face?</i>

02:32:52.706 --> 02:32:54.082
Her breasts?

02:32:55.709 --> 02:32:57.711
Or straight for her
c... cunt?

02:33:00.213 --> 02:33:01.631
Was it soft?

02:33:02.507 --> 02:33:04.050
Did it tighten up?

02:33:05.719 --> 02:33:07.554
Did it have many wrinkles?

02:33:08.555 --> 02:33:10.724
Was it sufficiently wet?

02:33:10.807 --> 02:33:14.311
How was the viscosity and transparency
of her vaginal secretion?

02:33:15.770 --> 02:33:17.898
Please, one more cigarette, sir.

02:33:44.883 --> 02:33:52.057
<i>Spider thread pulled into strings...</i>

02:33:52.140 --> 02:33:55.894
<i>I dare say no book
has ever described</i>

02:33:55.977 --> 02:33:58.980
<i>such a ferocious wedding night.</i>

02:34:03.485 --> 02:34:07.113
<i>I thought I heard a nightingale sing.</i>

02:34:41.940 --> 02:34:46.945
<i>And the clear, bright crimson blood...</i>

02:34:56.079 --> 02:34:58.290
<i>Thus the Lady became my wife.</i>

02:34:58.873 --> 02:35:02.836
<i>Coy one moment, bold the next...</i>

02:35:06.506 --> 02:35:10.760
But how was she coy,

02:35:11.344 --> 02:35:15.515
<i>how was she bold,
tell it to me in detail!</i>

02:35:16.016 --> 02:35:19.394
A story is all about the journey.

02:35:19.477 --> 02:35:21.187
You should know.

02:35:23.315 --> 02:35:24.858
<i>Did she resist?</i>

02:35:25.984 --> 02:35:28.361
So did you pinch her ass as punishment?

02:35:28.820 --> 02:35:32.490
Or did she spit at you in contempt?

02:35:33.616 --> 02:35:35.035
Or else...

02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:37.829
Did she beg you to do it?

02:35:38.872 --> 02:35:42.250
Like the lady in
<i>The Widow's Lapdog</i> ?

02:35:45.795 --> 02:35:47.047
How dare you!

02:35:47.464 --> 02:35:49.090
Hideko is my wife.

02:35:49.674 --> 02:35:53.970
What kind of scoundrel rattles on
about his wedding night!

02:37:30.233 --> 02:37:31.776
<i>It's odd...</i>

02:37:33.194 --> 02:37:34.988
Your smoke.

02:37:37.490 --> 02:37:40.910
It's cold, blue...

02:37:42.370 --> 02:37:48.042
<i>and strangely beautiful.</i>

02:37:49.586 --> 02:37:56.217
You too have become soft, slow and dull.

02:37:57.969 --> 02:38:00.930
Mercury is most deadly
in its gaseous state.

02:38:01.931 --> 02:38:03.766
One cigarette would have sufficed.

02:38:07.979 --> 02:38:12.275
At least I will die with my cock intact.

02:42:27.822 --> 02:42:33.327
THE HANDMAIDEN EXTENDED VERSION

02:44:55.052 --> 02:44:59.265
<i>I hear a sound in the distance</i>

02:44:59.348 --> 02:45:03.561
<i>that sounds like the steps of my love</i>

02:45:03.644 --> 02:45:07.940
<i>An echo that makes my heart</i>

02:45:08.024 --> 02:45:11.193
<i>skip a beat</i>

02:45:12.278 --> 02:45:16.032
<i>But I wait all through the night</i>

02:45:16.532 --> 02:45:20.453
<i>and my love never comes to me</i>

02:45:20.828 --> 02:45:24.582
<i>There is no end to the heartache</i>

02:45:25.082 --> 02:45:28.628
<i>that grips me in this hour</i>

02:45:29.337 --> 02:45:33.132
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

02:45:33.549 --> 02:45:36.719
<i>my dear love</i>

02:45:37.970 --> 02:45:42.016
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

02:45:42.099 --> 02:45:46.729
<i>my dear love</i>

02:46:03.704 --> 02:46:07.750
<i>But then in my waiting heart</i>

02:46:07.833 --> 02:46:12.171
<i>suddenly happiness overflows</i>

02:46:12.254 --> 02:46:16.092
<i>There you are in the distance</i>

02:46:16.509 --> 02:46:19.553
<i>coming to me</i>

02:46:20.805 --> 02:46:25.017
<i>Filled with dreams of a new life</i>

02:46:25.101 --> 02:46:29.313
<i>filled with happiness</i>

02:46:29.397 --> 02:46:33.609
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

02:46:33.693 --> 02:46:37.822
<i>flowers start to bloom</i>

02:46:37.905 --> 02:46:41.742
<i>Come my lover, come to me</i>

02:46:42.243 --> 02:46:45.454
<i>I missed you so</i>

02:46:46.580 --> 02:46:50.751
<i>Let's dream of happy times</i>

02:46:50.835 --> 02:46:55.214
<i>like long ago</i>

02:47:12.273 --> 02:47:16.068
<i>Filled with dreams of a new life</i>

02:47:16.569 --> 02:47:20.156
<i>filled with happiness</i>

02:47:20.906 --> 02:47:25.036
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

02:47:25.119 --> 02:47:28.664
<i>flowers start to bloom</i>

02:47:29.415 --> 02:47:33.502
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

02:47:33.586 --> 02:47:36.714
<i>my dear love</i>

02:47:37.965 --> 02:47:41.719
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

02:47:42.178 --> 02:47:46.307
<i>my dear love</i>
