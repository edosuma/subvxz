better way to start the day

01:14.830 --> 01:17.330
than with a refreshing
power walk.

01:20.670 --> 01:24.210
I'd rather start the day with
a refreshing power waffle.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.880
A big Belgian one

01:26.880 --> 01:29.620
with whipped cream
and tons of syrup.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.080
Oh, papa!

01:31.080 --> 01:32.120
You know, Rolly,

01:32.120 --> 01:34.960
it's that kind of thinking
that's keeping you behind.

01:37.670 --> 01:39.580
Wow, look at Rolly go!

01:39.580 --> 01:41.710
He's on an endorphin rush.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.670
More like a catering rush.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.920
Ooh!

01:47.920 --> 01:49.500
Uh-oh.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.120
It's about time
you got here.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.170
Cruella: You were due
30 seconds ago.

01:57.170 --> 02:00.210
Set the food out
on the tables provided

02:00.210 --> 02:01.790
before the guests arrive!

02:03.120 --> 02:04.290
Go!

02:06.670 --> 02:08.290
Now what?

02:08.290 --> 02:10.120
I'm surrounded
by incompetents,

02:10.120 --> 02:11.080
nincompoops,

02:11.080 --> 02:12.580
imbeciles.

02:14.210 --> 02:15.500
Hmmm.

02:19.170 --> 02:20.960
Lucky: I wonder
what's going on.

02:24.120 --> 02:27.250
Uh-Oh. This does
not look good.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.380
Okay. What do we do?

02:29.380 --> 02:31.040
Hmm. I've got a plan.

02:31.040 --> 02:33.040
You clumsy oaf.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.120
Can't you do anything?

02:35.120 --> 02:37.290
Must I do everything?

02:37.290 --> 02:39.040
Do something,
you little nothing.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.080
This DeVil family reunion
must be perfect.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.750
Everything needs
to be in place.

02:44.750 --> 02:45.830
Spot: Uh-oh.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.250
I'll be hosting...

02:47.250 --> 02:49.670
the head of the family.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.540
Ah... whoa!

02:51.540 --> 02:53.170
And another thing--

02:53.170 --> 02:54.750
-Oh! They're here.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.120
Ahhh.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.120
Ooh. Mmm, oh, yes.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.460
Mmm! Hmm...

03:08.460 --> 03:09.750
Welcome.

03:09.750 --> 03:13.000
P.H. DeVil.
Cecil B. DeVil.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.170
Ivy? Where is that
half

03:23.120 --> 03:26.500
Oh, I'm so glad
you could all make it.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.080
There wasn't much choice.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.040
Remember when cousin Deena
missed a family meeting?

03:31.040 --> 03:33.830
Nothing that a couple of
rabies shots couldn't
take care of.

03:33.830 --> 03:36.880
This is going to be
ever so much fun.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.460
It's coming.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.290
Memo to myself,

03:44.290 --> 03:46.830
I can do this.
I am not afraid.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.250
I have never been so calm.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.420
Malevola!

04:11.080 --> 04:12.290
Hi, Gammy.

04:12.290 --> 04:13.540
Mummy!

04:15.040 --> 04:17.000
No touching.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.620
Oh, she's talkative today.

04:19.620 --> 04:20.790
That's a good sign.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.330
Inside.

04:24.540 --> 04:28.170
♪ La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la ♪

04:28.170 --> 04:31.040
Cruella: I had the place
decorated just for you.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.540
Like it?

04:34.210 --> 04:37.040
No. I think not.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
Sit!

04:52.750 --> 04:54.620
So, M-M-M-Malevola...

04:54.620 --> 04:56.540
what brings us all together?

04:56.540 --> 05:00.290
I want our land back!

05:04.000 --> 05:06.790
Oh. That Dearly plot
next door?

05:06.790 --> 05:09.000
I've been working
on it,

05:09.000 --> 05:10.920
tirelessly, endlessly.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.120
Fruitlessly.

05:13.120 --> 05:17.040
Now I'm giving the rest of you
a shot.

05:17.040 --> 05:21.080
Whoever succeeds
inherits my fortune.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.290
Huh?

05:22.290 --> 05:25.380
Goody, goody, goody, goody,
goody, goody, goody...

05:25.380 --> 05:29.290
But Mummy, I'm your
loving, devoted daughter.

05:29.290 --> 05:32.460
The one who gets it all
when you croak.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.670
P.H. DeVil:
Mhm!

05:33.670 --> 05:36.880
Natural selection has
weeded you out, Cruella.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.420
I'm the high diver
in this gene pool.

05:39.420 --> 05:41.920
-I'll get back Malevola's--
-Not so fast!

05:41.920 --> 05:45.620
The most creative mind should
get her evil empire,

05:45.620 --> 05:47.290
and that is I,

05:47.290 --> 05:48.960
Cecil B. DeVil.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.500
Back off, you vultures.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.960
I'm not giving up yet.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.540
Can't we all
just get along?

06:03.500 --> 06:05.670
Stop your bickering!

06:05.670 --> 06:07.580
Let' s eat.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.830
This isn't turkey.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.500
Mmm. That deli never
gets my order right.

06:18.460 --> 06:19.500
All:
Puppies!

06:19.500 --> 06:21.080
Where

06:23.380 --> 06:25.920
Cerberus. Cujo.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.250
Brunch is served.

06:33.040 --> 06:33.960
Huh?

06:38.830 --> 06:39.830
Aah!

06:41.750 --> 06:44.830
It's us against
all of the DeVils.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.920
We've got to
defend the farm.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.710
So stay alert,

06:48.710 --> 06:50.830
and don't fall into
any of their traps.

06:50.830 --> 06:53.380
-Whoa!

06:53.380 --> 06:55.880
Thank you, Ed Pig,
for that visual aid.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.670
Now to recap...

06:57.670 --> 07:02.000
I have a feeling
we've dug our way
under the farm.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.830
A real heavy feeling.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.330
Off!

07:06.330 --> 07:07.920
Are you alright, Mayor?

07:07.920 --> 07:10.790
I bruised my bacon a bit,
but don't you worry none.

07:10.790 --> 07:13.790
My administration will
fix that pot hole
before you can...

07:13.790 --> 07:15.000
-Yeah.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.580
Is everything ready?

07:16.580 --> 07:19.830
Yes, sir. We dug under
the Dearly farm
just like you wanted.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.670
What are you going to do, Boss?
Plant mushrooms?

07:21.670 --> 07:22.710
Oww!

07:22.710 --> 07:26.290
No. My patented
earthquake machine,

07:26.290 --> 07:28.500
the Seismic Mayhematron ,

07:28.500 --> 07:31.670
will shake the Dearly farm
to rubble.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.460
P.H. DeVil:
They will be ruined

07:35.460 --> 07:38.250
and forced to sell the land
to the DeVils.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.420
Oh my gosh!

07:39.420 --> 07:43.540
P.H. DeVil:
10 seconds and
the farm is history.

07:44.830 --> 07:46.750
P.H. DeVil:
Turn it on!

07:46.750 --> 07:48.420
Oh, Yeah.

07:57.170 --> 07:59.960
Nanny: This was the most
powerful blender in the store.

07:59.960 --> 08:03.920
Ho, ho, it's perfect
for milkshakes.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.170
-Uh, I'll just have
juice, thanks.

08:10.170 --> 08:13.540
Lucky: How do we
stop that thing?

08:13.540 --> 08:16.380
I can't even get to it.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.880
I think I can.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.830
Spot: I don't see
an off switch.

08:25.830 --> 08:29.830
Maybe I can
return it to sender.

08:29.830 --> 08:32.540
Oh. Aaaah!

08:38.120 --> 08:40.880
Whew! Good thinking, Spot.

08:40.880 --> 08:41.920
Now, let's...

08:41.920 --> 08:43.790
Get out of here, ah!

08:43.790 --> 08:46.080
Before the place
caves in.

08:50.540 --> 08:53.210
Victory is mine.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.120
I can feel it.

09:02.460 --> 09:05.710
This blows chunks.

09:19.710 --> 09:21.830
I can't hear what
they're saying.

09:21.830 --> 09:24.000
We've got to find out
what their next scheme is

09:24.000 --> 09:25.540
before it happens.

09:25.540 --> 09:28.080
And, I've got an idea.

09:30.790 --> 09:33.250
Hey, careful!
Birds aren't going cheap.

09:34.290 --> 09:37.000
-I'll do something huge!

09:37.000 --> 09:39.170
High concept,
big budget.

09:39.170 --> 09:41.750
Okay, fade in with
special effects.

09:41.750 --> 09:44.790
Fade out on
total destruction.

09:47.290 --> 09:48.460
What do you think?

09:48.460 --> 09:50.120
Too soft.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.830
Needs more violence.

09:51.830 --> 09:53.330
Alright, Toby.

09:53.330 --> 09:54.540
I want this in one take.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.420
Lucky: Sweet Cream,
Buttermilk, run!

10:08.670 --> 10:10.080
Ba-cawk!

10:15.710 --> 10:18.620
Cruella:
A cookie monster?

10:18.620 --> 10:21.380
Are you trying to
scare them off the farm

10:21.380 --> 10:23.540
or block their arteries?

10:23.540 --> 10:25.330
Pardonne moi , sister,

10:25.330 --> 10:27.420
but that mechanical effect

10:27.420 --> 10:28.710
won "Best Spokescreature"

10:28.710 --> 10:31.040
in a dramatic
high-fat snack commercial
last year.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.290
It's a winner.

10:32.290 --> 10:35.330
-Jasper: Hello, CB,
We're on the set.
-Good.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.790
In 5...

10:36.790 --> 10:37.620
-4...

10:37.620 --> 10:38.750
Jasper: Uh, CB...

10:38.750 --> 10:40.540
What's our motivation again?

10:40.540 --> 10:43.710
C.B. DeVil: You're the biggest,
meanest hunk of cookie dough
on the planet.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.420
You want revenge!

10:45.420 --> 10:48.080
So, you want us to
eject the cream filling now?

10:48.080 --> 10:50.880
C.B. DeVil: Uh! I've got
a headache this big, and it's
got you written all over it.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.080
I want you to
attack the house.

10:58.750 --> 11:03.540
Horace and Jasper:
Whoo, yow!
Whoa, whoa!

11:05.540 --> 11:06.960
Horace:
What was that?

11:06.960 --> 11:09.580
Hey! Chockzillia is
not cookie dough.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.000
He's rubber.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.750
I've got a plan.

11:15.210 --> 11:16.210
Found it.

11:26.580 --> 11:28.540
No, no, no!

11:28.540 --> 11:30.750
That is not
in the script.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.330
Malevola:
It's still too soft.

11:39.330 --> 11:41.420
-Nice doggy.

11:41.420 --> 11:43.880
Hold me. I'm not
afraid to hug a man.

11:43.880 --> 11:48.580
-Malevola: Your turn to
get our land back, Ivy.
-Wait.

11:48.580 --> 11:50.540
I have a foolproof plan.

11:50.540 --> 11:52.500
I must have
one more chance.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.120
To do what?

11:54.120 --> 11:56.580
Humiliate yourself again?

11:56.580 --> 11:59.000
That's okay.
I'm in no hurry.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.380
Aunty Cruella
can fail first.

12:01.380 --> 12:04.960
I mean, um,
oh, um, go ahead of me.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.670
You're so precious.

12:08.670 --> 12:10.620
You're on.
Make it work.

12:10.620 --> 12:13.500
Oh, I will, Mummy,
I promise.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.210
It's the most underhanded,
evil scheme

12:16.210 --> 12:17.580
I've ever cooked up.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.210
I'll make you proud,

12:19.210 --> 12:20.920
and I'll get rid
of the Dearlys

12:20.920 --> 12:22.960
once and for all.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.580
Yes?

12:31.580 --> 12:35.750
We have a singing telegram
for the Dearlys and Nanny.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.540
Um, can we skip
the singing?

12:37.540 --> 12:39.670
It's hard to breathe
with fractured ribs.

12:39.670 --> 12:43.330
Hmm. We're invited to
the DeVil family reunion.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.750
It starts in 10 minutes.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.170
Do we have to go?

12:47.170 --> 12:50.830
Attendance mandatory
or Anita loses her job.

12:50.830 --> 12:52.210
Lucky: A party?

12:52.210 --> 12:54.500
That doesn't sound like
and evil scheme
to take the farm.

12:54.500 --> 12:58.880
Any party of Cruella's
is just an evil scheme
with cocktail wieners.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.460
Wieners!

13:05.040 --> 13:07.250
Cruella,

13:07.250 --> 13:09.040
what happened
to your house?

13:09.040 --> 13:12.580
Oh, just doing
a little remodelling.

13:12.580 --> 13:15.460
Contractors make
such a mess.

13:15.460 --> 13:18.830
Well come along.
My parties are
just to die for.

13:21.580 --> 13:23.000
Did you hear that?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.500
"To die for."

13:24.500 --> 13:27.080
They're going to
bump off Roger and Anita.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.250
Thank goodness for
not jumping to conclusions.

13:30.250 --> 13:32.620
Anita, Ninny, Ratpack...

13:32.620 --> 13:34.540
meet the DeVils.

13:34.540 --> 13:36.420
-Hello.
-Hello.

13:36.420 --> 13:38.210
Nice to see you again.

13:38.210 --> 13:39.540
Charmed.

13:39.540 --> 13:43.380
Would you like some punch
before we begin
the festivities?

13:43.380 --> 13:47.040
And now for some
fun and games.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.580
Family slides!

13:49.580 --> 13:54.500
Oh, and here I am at my
first trip to the
petting zoo.

13:55.710 --> 13:59.000
Funny, all the animals
ran away
shortly after that.

14:04.750 --> 14:07.670
Oh well. So ends
my preschool years.

14:07.670 --> 14:09.080
Gee. That was fun.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.080
-We'll be going now.
-Cruella: Nonsense!

14:11.080 --> 14:14.250
There are 57 more
carousels to go.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.620
You wouldn't dream of missing
my kindergarten years.

14:17.620 --> 14:19.580
Jasper:
Now more over this way.

14:20.620 --> 14:24.080
To the right.
No, not-- not that way.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.460
Oh, that's perfect.

14:25.460 --> 14:28.790
Cruella:
And here I am at
Jacky Jackrabbit Land ,

14:28.790 --> 14:30.920
before that
unexplained accident.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.250
-I don't get it.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.210
They're not even trying
to bump off Roger and Anita.

14:39.210 --> 14:41.460
What do you mean?

14:41.460 --> 14:43.380
They're boring them to death.

14:43.380 --> 14:44.500
No. Wait a minute.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.080
What if we got it wrong?

14:46.080 --> 14:48.040
What do the DeVils really want?

14:48.040 --> 14:50.380
Roger and Anita? No.

14:50.380 --> 14:51.460
The farm!

14:51.460 --> 14:53.420
Maybe they're just
keeping them busy

14:53.420 --> 14:55.460
while they're doing
something to the farm.

15:05.540 --> 15:08.880
Lucky:
What happened to the farm?
It's gone!

15:12.380 --> 15:13.880
Cruella:
And here we are.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.880
This is my vacation
on the beautiful
beaches of Aruba.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.210
-Cruella: And here's
some more sand

15:19.210 --> 15:20.620
and some more water

15:20.620 --> 15:23.620
and here's-- that
looks like some sand there.

15:23.620 --> 15:27.500
Here I am at breakfast
having, uh...

15:27.500 --> 15:30.330
Mission accomplished
Miss DeVil, Sir.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.330
Now, now people!
Party's over.

15:33.330 --> 15:35.670
Scoot! Home with you!
The limo's waiting.

15:35.670 --> 15:39.170
That's okay, Cruella.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.670
We'll walk.

15:40.670 --> 15:41.790
No. No.

15:41.790 --> 15:43.210
I insist.

15:44.460 --> 15:47.120
To the Dearly farm.

15:48.420 --> 15:51.750
-Nanny:
That drive sure seemed long.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.380
I took the scenic route.

15:53.380 --> 15:56.040
Why? The windows
are blacked out.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.380
Not mine.

15:59.290 --> 16:01.290
Cruella:
It's working.

16:01.290 --> 16:03.290
They're completely fooled.

16:03.290 --> 16:07.330
They don't realize their farm
is now in the middle
of the swamp.

16:07.330 --> 16:09.250
And by the time they do...

16:09.250 --> 16:13.330
they'll be up to their necks
in quicksand.

16:13.330 --> 16:15.420
Yes. so what?

16:15.420 --> 16:18.580
Big deal.

16:18.580 --> 16:20.620
I did it, Mummy.

16:20.620 --> 16:22.880
The land is ours.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.580
Aren't you proud of me?

16:24.580 --> 16:26.420
I came through for you.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.710
You're not
completely worthless.

16:29.710 --> 16:31.250
Did you hear that?

16:31.250 --> 16:33.290
Four whole words of praise.

16:33.290 --> 16:34.790
She's gushing over me.

16:34.790 --> 16:37.290
This calls for
a celebration.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.500
We'll toast our victory.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.420
To our new land.

16:41.420 --> 16:43.710
To new beginnings
for the DeVils.

16:43.710 --> 16:45.790
To my new home...

16:45.790 --> 16:47.330
Next door!

16:49.420 --> 16:50.670
Cruella: You're moving...

16:50.670 --> 16:52.330
next door?

16:52.330 --> 16:55.120
For the rest of my life.

16:55.120 --> 16:58.540
Or yours if I
outlive you.

16:58.540 --> 17:00.920
How delightful.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.170
You hadn't mentioned that.

17:03.170 --> 17:05.380
Excuse me.

17:09.710 --> 17:11.880
Cruella: Oh, she's got
to be stopped.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.170
But who do you turn to

17:13.170 --> 17:15.710
if you need to
get rid of your own mother.

17:15.710 --> 17:18.250
-Ivy: ♪ La-la-la-la ♪
Huh?!

17:25.170 --> 17:29.960
Even my secret stash
of buried fritters
is gone.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.170
Oh, that's so wrong.

17:32.170 --> 17:33.710
Gee, Auntie Cruella...

17:33.710 --> 17:35.620
I love what you've
done with the place.

17:35.620 --> 17:38.000
Quick! Hide
behind something.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.920
And that something would be?

17:39.920 --> 17:41.620
The fritter hole!

17:43.170 --> 17:45.920
I know now that I will
never get an ounce
of appreciation

17:45.920 --> 17:48.210
from that impossible
to please pipsqueak.

17:48.210 --> 17:50.210
No matter what I do.

17:50.210 --> 17:53.250
Fine! But I won't have her
breathing down my neck.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.040
I'll give you
anything you want

17:55.040 --> 17:57.000
if you can keep her from
moving next door.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.330
Okey-dokey.

17:58.330 --> 18:02.290
Let me have all your
nice money when
you go to heaven...

18:02.290 --> 18:04.000
or wherever.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.170
Sign here.

18:06.330 --> 18:09.960
No price is too high
for my independence.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.710
Just do the job.

18:11.710 --> 18:14.210
I didn't have time
to plan anything big

18:14.210 --> 18:16.330
so I'm just going to
redirect an asteroid

18:16.330 --> 18:17.960
to go boom on
the Dearly Farm

18:17.960 --> 18:20.710
making a great big hole
that no one can live in.

18:22.170 --> 18:23.330
Won't be a minute.

18:23.330 --> 18:25.670
With the flick of a switch
and a pull of a lever

18:25.670 --> 18:28.380
everything will
be alright.

18:28.380 --> 18:31.750
I like it.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.830
Make it work.

18:33.830 --> 18:36.290
Spot:
We'll never get the farm
back from wherever it is

18:36.290 --> 18:39.170
to where it belongs
if Ivy destroys the land.

18:39.170 --> 18:41.250
Lucky: Then it's
up to us to stop her.

18:42.170 --> 18:44.880
Trajectory divided
by inertia,

18:44.880 --> 18:46.250
carry the three.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.790
Computer voice: Armed.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.290
Ow. Get away from me,
you pigeon.

18:58.620 --> 18:59.790
Aah!

19:04.920 --> 19:07.330
Computer voice:
Asteroid improperly diverted.

19:07.330 --> 19:09.250
New target,
Villa DeVil.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.960
Uh-oh!

19:15.120 --> 19:17.040
Ivy: I've got to divert it
from Villa DeVil.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.250
Computer voice:
Asteroid diverted

19:26.250 --> 19:28.170
to unpopulated
swampy area.

19:28.170 --> 19:29.250
Whew!

19:46.420 --> 19:48.040
What the...?

20:01.920 --> 20:04.210
Hey!
The farm is back.

20:04.210 --> 20:06.620
There is no reality.

20:06.620 --> 20:09.170
And Cruella's place
is totalled.

20:09.170 --> 20:11.540
Ah yes. It just
goes to show you.

20:11.540 --> 20:14.170
What goes around
comes around.

20:14.170 --> 20:16.380
And reduces everything
you own to rubble.

20:16.380 --> 20:19.000
Anita: But I was sure
I felt something.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.250
Probably just
a truck passing by.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.460
Malevola:
I take back my praise.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.500
Praise

20:42.500 --> 20:44.620
You never praise
anything I do.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.960
I move a 40-acre
farm for you

20:45.960 --> 20:48.080
and that's not good enough.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.500
I don't want to
be your heir.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.040
I don't want
to be your daughter

20:51.040 --> 20:54.880
and I definitely
don't want to be
your next door neighbor!

20:56.290 --> 20:58.380
You can be fixed.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.120
Listen, young lady.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.580
Oh, to what?

21:03.580 --> 21:06.580
That's all you ever give me.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.420
I had to take it
as a kid

21:08.420 --> 21:10.120
but now that
I'm an adult

21:10.120 --> 21:12.380
you're going to
take some of mine.

21:12.380 --> 21:14.250
You're a control freak.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.210
You're as cuddly
as a gargoyle

21:16.210 --> 21:19.000
and have the fashion sense
of a druid.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.880
How do you like that?

21:23.830 --> 21:25.920
At last...

21:25.920 --> 21:29.120
the daughter
I've always wanted.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.960
Come to Mama.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.460
You're not mad?

21:34.460 --> 21:36.460
I'm proud.

21:36.460 --> 21:40.210
Proud to have you
inherit my fortune.

21:40.210 --> 21:43.920
You showed real
DeVil backbone.

21:43.920 --> 21:47.460
Hm. In fact
A lot of bones.

21:47.460 --> 21:49.920
You should eat better.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.120
Mother?

21:51.120 --> 21:54.920
Ivy: ♪ La-la-la-la ♪

21:54.920 --> 21:57.920
Oh goody.
I love happy endings.

21:57.920 --> 22:02.040
Aunt Cruella gets
Gammy's money,
and I get Aunty Cruella's.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.380
That means-- mwah--

22:04.380 --> 22:06.290
I get it all!
