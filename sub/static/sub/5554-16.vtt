00:05.272 --> 00:07.206
WALTER:
<i> I'm Walter O'Brien.</i>

00:07.207 --> 00:09.141
<i> I run a team of geniuses</i>
<i> who handle worldwide threats</i>

00:09.143 --> 00:11.110
<i> only we can solve.</i>

00:11.112 --> 00:14.113
<i> Sylvester is</i>
<i> a human calculator.</i>

00:14.115 --> 00:15.280
<i> Happy's a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:15.282 --> 00:18.017
<i> And Toby is our behaviorist.</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:20.285
<i> Agent Cabe Gallo</i>
<i> is our government handler.</i>

00:20.287 --> 00:22.454
<i> And Paige helps translates</i>
<i> the world for us</i>

00:22.456 --> 00:25.290
<i> while we help her understand</i>
<i> her genius son.</i>

00:25.292 --> 00:26.392
<i> Though sometimes</i>
<i> our biggest challenge</i>

00:26.394 --> 00:28.260
<i> is understanding each other.</i>

00:28.262 --> 00:30.362
<i> Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

00:35.503 --> 00:37.102
(chuckles):
Come on, Toby.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.138
This is hazelnut creamer.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.240
And that's a table.
And that's a chair.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.242
I'm pretty good
at this game.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.676
You wrote "hazelnut"
in front of creamer again

00:44.678 --> 00:46.178
on the grocery list.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.614
I hate hazelnut. People
like flavored creamers.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.349
"Creamer" is a flavor.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.684
And you could've just written
a different item under it.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.436
You could just relax.

00:54.437 --> 00:56.187
Don't be such a creamer-screamer.
I'm not screaming.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.589
Though I could very easily,
if you don't stop

00:57.591 --> 00:58.791
that nonsense
you've been pulling.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.092
Really?
Yes.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.093
Absolutely.
Okay, okay.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.594
This has got to end.
What does?

01:02.596 --> 01:03.562
You two fighting.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.164
Constantly lately.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.565
It's driving everyone nuts.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.433
CABE: He's right.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.567
You two argue like

01:08.569 --> 01:10.069
an old married couple.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.737
He's intentionally
antagonistic.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.772
Actually I'm half antagonistic,
on my mother's side.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.308
But my father--
100% oppositional.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.310
Over the past weeks,
your antics have gone

01:18.312 --> 01:20.079
from petty annoyance
to overtly combative.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.347
Objection. Inflammatory.
Overruled.

01:22.349 --> 01:23.715
Objection. You can't
make that call.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.217
You two are sweet
on each other.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.702
BOTH:
Objection!

01:26.703 --> 01:28.186
Okay, if we're going
to play kangaroo court,

01:28.189 --> 01:31.323
I have to go out of pocket
to sweeten my java

01:31.325 --> 01:33.258
because all we normally
we have here is regular creamer.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.227
That honey is from Kovelsky's.
It's free.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.762
Immaterial.
You know what?

01:36.764 --> 01:38.864
You both suck. Your bickering
is making everyone miserable.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.299
Copy that.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.101
You're being sentenced
to couples therapy.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.802
Awesome.
What? No.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.270
I'm with jerk-face.
Well, too bad.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.772
I manage this ball club

01:46.774 --> 01:48.407
and I've noticed things
escalating for a while,

01:48.409 --> 01:50.242
so I did some research.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.845
Dr. Cecil P. Rizzuto.

01:52.847 --> 01:54.130
Yes, he specializes

01:54.131 --> 01:55.414
in business partners--
I'm getting you in

01:55.416 --> 01:57.216
this morning while
Happy, Cabe and I

01:57.218 --> 01:59.184
prepare for our pitch
to Hudler Motors.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.819
But...
No buts.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.255
You heard the judge.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.623
Thank you.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.831
(Paige typing)

02:16.270 --> 02:18.437
Good job, Mom.
Fair but stern.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.805
I might not be a genius,

02:19.807 --> 02:22.441
but I can still tell
when you want something.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.577
A permission slip, so I can
go with my college class

02:25.579 --> 02:27.646
on a kayak trip along
the Channel Islands.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.648
Kayaking in the ocean? No.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.917
It's for my
marine biology class.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.553
Is the professor going?
No.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.455
I'm not letting you go
without adult supervision.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.390
Some of the students are 19.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.759
Real adults. Sorry.
And no means no.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.828
Uh, totally agree with your
stance on watercraft danger,

02:42.830 --> 02:44.396
but if Ralph doesn't partake

02:44.398 --> 02:46.398
in the field study,
his grades will suffer.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.333
I can take him
to the tide pools.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.569
He can explore
indigenous sea life.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.704
Bus goes right up the PCH.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.473
Malibu's far and the rocks
by the tide pools

02:54.475 --> 02:55.841
are sharp and slippery.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.942
Well, he'll be with me.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.410
Yeah... no, I don't think so.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.845
HAPPY:
Maybe you can roll Ralph

02:59.847 --> 03:01.346
in bubble wrap before he goes.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.649
Mother's only one S
from Smother.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.317
Let the kid be a boy.

03:05.319 --> 03:08.187
We're raising a nation of
pansies, for Pete's sake.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.757
Fine. Okay. You can go.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.861
Sylvester.
Uh-huh?

03:15.863 --> 03:20.465
But he is your responsibility,
so if he gets hurt, cut,

03:20.467 --> 03:23.302
so much as a hair out of place,
you will not like me very much.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.437
Not sure I like you
very much right now.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.505
Good.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.410
We'll take my car.
That heap?

03:31.412 --> 03:32.678
I'm taking my own sled.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.313
Well, two cars
are economically

03:34.315 --> 03:35.614
and environmentally
inefficient,

03:35.616 --> 03:37.983
but still preferable
to riding with you.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.486
God help that therapist.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.355
(sighs)

03:43.357 --> 03:45.991
(gulls screeching,
surf crashing)

03:45.993 --> 03:47.743
Okay, the first thing

03:47.744 --> 03:49.494
I want to do in the ocean
is take some samples.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.396
Whoa.
Pull the reins, buddy.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.965
No one's going
into the ocean.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.900
You're hitting the tide pools,
and then that's it.

03:54.902 --> 03:58.337
But we're right here.
Ralph...

03:58.339 --> 04:00.239
the ocean's the world's toilet.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.673
You want to stay out of toilets.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.443
You also want to stay safe,
so here, put these on.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.744
Water wings?

04:05.746 --> 04:08.413
I'm only going in a
quarter-inch-- can't hurt me.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.781
But your mom can hurt me.

04:09.783 --> 04:13.352
Besides, you can
never be too prepared. See--

04:13.354 --> 04:16.455
I'm wearing a state-of-the-art
life vest underneath my shirt.

04:16.457 --> 04:19.925
It's paper-flat but inflates in
seconds when exposed to water.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.294
I got you one. Here.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.329
No.
Why not?

04:24.331 --> 04:25.664
Happy made it for me
with tech similar

04:25.666 --> 04:26.798
to the airbags
she's presenting today.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.367
Why?

04:28.369 --> 04:30.802
Because she loves me.
Like a brother.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.805
I used the same tech
for a life vest I made

04:33.807 --> 04:35.274
for a lunatic I work with.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.377
Just one of the many
applications for this product.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.512
When talking to the heads
of the Hudler Motors,

04:40.514 --> 04:43.448
try not to refer to our
coworkers as lunatics.

04:43.450 --> 04:47.452
Yeah, so in short, we appreciate
Hudler Motors' interest,

04:47.454 --> 04:50.922
and if you decide to go with
a standard engineering firm

04:50.924 --> 04:54.426
for your new airbags...
well, that is stupid.

04:54.428 --> 04:57.296
Food for thought--
instead of, uh, saying that

04:57.298 --> 04:59.998
to the people who might
hire us, how about you stress

05:00.000 --> 05:01.867
"this device
comes with the brainpower

05:01.869 --> 05:04.870
of four geniuses behind it
and no one else can match that"?

05:04.872 --> 05:06.672
Sounds like we're begging.
CABE:  You are.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.373
It's called
getting business.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.809
You're letting them know they're
working with top professionals.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.312
I'd be Zack Morris,
Cabe is Mr. Belding,

05:13.314 --> 05:15.547
Paige is Kelly and
Sylvester's Screech.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.782
Now let's do
<i>What's Happening?</i>

05:16.784 --> 05:18.850
You're Rog,
Happy's Dee...

05:18.852 --> 05:21.019
Why do I feel like you're
intentionally trying to annoy me?

05:21.021 --> 05:23.622
See, that's such
a Rog thing to say.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.064
Hello?

05:32.066 --> 05:34.399
(speaking Cantonese)

05:35.669 --> 05:39.838
Uh, sorry-- we're looking
for, uh, Dr. Cecil Rizzuto.

05:42.476 --> 05:46.878
(speaking Cantonese)

05:46.880 --> 05:48.714
Did he move offices?
There's a door sign.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.350
Any English at all?

05:51.352 --> 05:55.387
(speaking Cantonese)

05:55.389 --> 05:57.022
Okay, we're done here.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.792
See how hard it is
to communicate

06:00.794 --> 06:03.895
when we're not speaking
the same language?

06:03.897 --> 06:06.381
So you're the therapist?

06:06.382 --> 06:08.866
You're learning already,
grasshopper. Grab some couch.

06:08.869 --> 06:13.071
Ms. Dineen told me
about your... issues.

06:15.376 --> 06:16.541
(Walter chuckling)

06:16.543 --> 06:19.878
Another language
that speaks volumes

06:19.880 --> 06:21.980
is body language.

06:21.982 --> 06:25.550
What does my body language
tell you about me?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.419
From your
glutteral lean,

06:27.421 --> 06:28.653
it says you have hemorrhoids.

06:28.655 --> 06:31.490
Correct.
That's perfectly natural.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.958
I'm not embarrassed.

06:32.960 --> 06:37.462
But it also shows that
I am open and sharing.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.164
Where'd you get
your degree, Doctor?

06:39.166 --> 06:42.701
I have a BS from Plimpton
Internet University

06:42.703 --> 06:45.170
in, uh, Conflict Resolution,

06:45.172 --> 06:49.141
and I'm working toward an online
Masters in People Studies.

06:49.143 --> 06:51.109
I'm gonna kill Paige.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.898
(gasps)

06:55.899 --> 06:58.617
Dear God, going in there should
be a challenge on<i> Survivor.</i>

06:58.619 --> 07:01.119
Can we get to the beach already?
Yes.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.988
First we need
to sunscreen up.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.022
And then you'll
be ready...

07:04.024 --> 07:05.690
(phone beeping)
Hold on.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.695
Oh, boy.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.630
A message from the SoCal
Office of Emergency Personnel.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.864
Why do you get it?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.733
I signed up for alerts.
It's prudent to be...

07:14.735 --> 07:16.435
Holy smokes!

07:16.437 --> 07:19.438
A 7.8 quake just struck the
bottom of the San Andreas

07:19.440 --> 07:20.539
at Conejo Pass.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.073
Okay, based on
the underlying bedrock

07:22.075 --> 07:23.809
of the pass, the quake
could either brake right,

07:23.811 --> 07:26.578
dissipating in the desert,
or veer left...

07:26.580 --> 07:30.916
along the fault, which gives the
rest of L.A. 30 seconds until--

07:30.918 --> 07:32.484
I need to reach out
to the others!

07:34.955 --> 07:36.655
Okay, Ralph, we gotta get out
from underneath these trees.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.790
Everyone!
There's an earthquake coming!

07:38.792 --> 07:40.659
It's coming for you!

07:40.661 --> 07:42.594
Okay, in between those two cars.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.563
Let's go.
(rumbling)

07:44.565 --> 07:47.499
(car alarms blaring)
It's coming.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.568
Get down!

07:49.570 --> 07:50.802
(people shouting, screaming)
(grunting)

07:54.241 --> 07:55.807
Okay, now that we worked on

07:55.809 --> 07:57.676
your presentation,
let's talk about

07:57.678 --> 08:00.545
your... presentation.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.681
What's wrong with my clothes?

08:02.683 --> 08:04.916
You look like you just
got off a motorcycle.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.952
I did just get off a motorcycle.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.488
(cell phones chiming,
ringing, buzzing)

08:11.859 --> 08:13.124
"The big one's coming"?

08:13.126 --> 08:14.526
I just got
the same thing.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.727
What is Sly talking about?

08:15.729 --> 08:17.496
(rumbling)

08:17.498 --> 08:20.665
Everyone, drop,
cover, hold on.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.779
BOTH:
♪ What would you do ♪

08:34.781 --> 08:36.548
♪ If my heart was... ♪

08:36.550 --> 08:40.519
If you can harmonize
"More Than Words" together,

08:40.521 --> 08:43.588
then you can have
harmony together.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.123
Sing it out.
Pull the laces.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.158
(rumbling)
♪ Show you feel... ♪

08:47.160 --> 08:50.595
Get down. Get down!

08:57.738 --> 08:59.738
Walter, I don't want
my last act on earth

08:59.740 --> 09:01.606
to be singing a capella
with you.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.642
Holy crap.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.144
(rumbling, glass shattering)

09:06.146 --> 09:08.547
(rumbling fades,
car alarms blaring)

09:08.549 --> 09:10.682
(grunting)

09:12.686 --> 09:14.619
Well, that was
a minimum 7.5.

09:14.621 --> 09:17.122
I think our session's
over, Walt.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.623
Is everyone all right?

09:18.625 --> 09:20.091
PAIGE: Yeah.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.760
I have to call Ralph.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.664
The line's dead.
It's not working.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.666
Uh, network overload.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.301
Same thing happened on 9/11.

09:29.303 --> 09:31.336
Combination
of infrastructure damage

09:31.338 --> 09:34.239
and millions trying to use the
same system simultaneously.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.640
Okay, I still have
to know if my son is okay.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.676
There's still a chance.
Take out your comms.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.144
On the back, there's a hole.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.679
Reset the comm
by pressing the hole.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.280
What the hell
are we doing?

09:42.282 --> 09:44.282
Connecting to a backup
frequency Sly designed.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.717
The comms run on microwaves.

09:45.719 --> 09:49.688
Uh, the signal
is inconsistent at best,

09:49.690 --> 09:51.089
but better than nothing.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.224
Why'd he want
to do something like that?

09:53.226 --> 09:55.260
Earthquakes, wildfires,
mudslides, flash floods--

09:55.262 --> 09:56.895
Southern California is biblical.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.897
The only thing
that's missing are locusts.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.066
Hence a back-up comm system.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.735
Now, if I could only find
my glasses so I could do mine.

10:03.737 --> 10:04.903
(crunching)

10:04.905 --> 10:06.771
Oh, man.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.276
I can hardly see anything
without these on.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.379
(sighs) Ralph, can you activate
my comm for me?

10:14.381 --> 10:15.614
Thank you.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.749
Ralph, Sylvester?
Can you hear me?

10:17.751 --> 10:18.783
Mom! It's me.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.051
Are you okay?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.252
(sighs)
Yeah, fine, sweetheart.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.654
I'm just so glad
to hear your voice.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.923
Are you guys okay?
Yes. We both are.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.625
Yeah, we are, too.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.760
(indistinct chatter,
car alarms wailing)

10:28.762 --> 10:31.162
Can't say the same
for our city.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.331
I didn't think L.A.
could possibly get worse.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.866
All right, the best plan
is for us all

10:34.868 --> 10:36.768
to get back to the garage
and assess

10:36.770 --> 10:38.269
any damage done
to our equipment.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.972
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.374
That's not good.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.909
Look out. Look out.
Look out.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.345
All right, I think
that's the last of it.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.314
We're safe now.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.784
(over radio): Eastbound ramp at
the 710 and 5 freeway's down.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.569
All emergency personnel.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.353
Reports of multiple building
collapse in Rialto.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.823
Requesting firefighter backup
downtown.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.992
Repeat: several blocks downtown
are in flames.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.394
Oh, this is as bad as it gets.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.897
No, it's going
to get much worse.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.399
Now, the water pipe explosions
occurred after the earthquake,

11:07.401 --> 11:09.034
when there was no shake.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.735
That means they blew up
from pressure build-up.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.771
Which means the water pipes
are pinched off

11:12.773 --> 11:14.739
somewhere further up the line
to cause that build-up.

11:14.741 --> 11:15.840
Don't the water and gas lines

11:15.842 --> 11:17.342
run parallel
to each other in L.A.?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.044
HAPPY:
Uh, yes. I've read up

11:19.045 --> 11:20.745
on how it was an engineering
marvel when designed.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.681
It ran utilities
all the way out to Vegas.

11:22.683 --> 11:25.083
Bad news is, the pipes
go through a meter station

11:25.085 --> 11:28.186
under Koreatown--
if the pipes are pinched off...

11:28.188 --> 11:30.188
Then the gas pressure
is building up as we speak.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.791
We're talking about--
A potential megaton blast.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.293
That's more than an A-bomb.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.794
Right under
everyone in Koreatown.

11:49.710 --> 11:50.909
(siren wailing)

11:50.911 --> 11:52.410
Walter, we're talking
<i>mucho</i> lives here!

11:52.412 --> 11:54.112
We got to figure out
how to warn people!

11:54.114 --> 11:55.880
Okay, all communications
are down.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.749
Even emergency channels--
so, time?

11:57.751 --> 12:00.719
The comm signal isn't great, but
I think you asked for a timing?

12:00.721 --> 12:02.120
Assuming the gas line
was compromised

12:02.122 --> 12:03.788
right when the quake hit,

12:03.790 --> 12:06.858
and given the PSI of a
large-diameter municipal pipe,

12:06.860 --> 12:08.193
we're looking
at 35 minutes tops!

12:08.195 --> 12:09.360
Yeah, but the gas companies have

12:09.362 --> 12:10.862
automatic shut-off censors,
right?

12:10.864 --> 12:12.731
TOBY: Their headquarters
are outside Rialto.

12:12.733 --> 12:13.932
We just heard
there's substantial

12:13.934 --> 12:15.450
building collapse
in that area.

12:15.451 --> 12:16.967
If the gas company's fail-safes
are compromised,

12:16.970 --> 12:19.738
then the gas buildup
continues unabated.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.473
And from the Old Faithfuls
we're looking at here,

12:21.475 --> 12:22.907
that's the case.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.011
Walter, you doing this
for dramatic effect,

12:27.013 --> 12:29.280
or are you actually thinking?

12:29.282 --> 12:31.750
Happy, if water's
overflowing a bathtub,

12:31.752 --> 12:33.752
and the tub might crash
through the floor,

12:33.754 --> 12:35.837
now, what do you do first?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.921
Do you empty the tub
or do you shut off the water?

12:37.924 --> 12:38.957
Shut the water,
then empty the tub.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.715
Exactly!

12:40.716 --> 12:42.472
And right now,
the pressure's too high.

12:42.473 --> 12:44.229
It's going to explode
as the gas expands in the pipe.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.397
So long as more gas
is being fed into that pipe,

12:46.399 --> 12:47.999
it's just gonna make
the pipe blow sooner.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.234
WALTER:
Correct.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.902
Now, Sly, you're close
to the Malibu Hills.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.338
There is a fire road
in Murphy Canyon

12:53.340 --> 12:55.290
that I used to hike
with Megan.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.241
Now, there's a cut-off station
for the over-ground portion

12:57.244 --> 12:59.944
of the line,
in case of wildfires.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.312
Now, you need to cut
off that gas feed

13:01.314 --> 13:02.847
while we get to
the meter station

13:02.849 --> 13:05.083
under Koreatown, to vent it
before it detonates.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.918
It's so funny,
that sounded like you said

13:06.920 --> 13:08.286
we're heading
towards the danger.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.954
It won't explode
if we get there in time.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.856
And if we don't, we'll just
be right on top of it!

13:11.858 --> 13:12.824
No, we'll be right next to it!

13:12.826 --> 13:14.859
Come on.

13:14.861 --> 13:17.195
Now, the surface streets
are gonna be flooded

13:17.197 --> 13:18.830
with emergency vehicles,
debris,

13:18.832 --> 13:20.231
collapsed roads--
the most efficient

13:20.233 --> 13:21.966
means of transport

13:21.968 --> 13:23.835
is underground!

13:23.837 --> 13:25.436
What's with the breath analyzer?

13:25.438 --> 13:27.338
Operates on the same
tech as gas detectors.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.208
Small tweak and we'll know
if we're heading toward danger.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.577
Oh, I already know that
we're heading towards danger.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.146
Everyone set your watches
for a 34-minute countdown.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.116
Happy, you need to try
to meet up with us.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.084
I might need your help
with the pipe system mechanics.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.419
Heading to the car now.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.854
We'll be there
as soon as we can.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.556
MAN: Help!
WOMAN: Help!

13:44.558 --> 13:45.890
MAN 2: Get us
out of here!

13:45.892 --> 13:48.026
MAN:  Help! CABE: Oh, man.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.360
Uh, scratch that, Walt.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.129
We're not gonna get
there any time soon.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.899
The water is electrified!

13:54.901 --> 13:56.451
We're trapped!

13:56.452 --> 13:58.002
It's all right,
just stay there! Stay calm!

13:58.004 --> 13:59.537
We can get you
out of there!

13:59.539 --> 14:00.872
We can get them
out of there, right?

14:00.874 --> 14:02.440
If we can, we better do it fast.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.975
There's no way
to stop that busted main

14:03.977 --> 14:05.009
without the water company's
help.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.511
And there's no way
to contact them.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.063
And once that
electrified water

14:08.064 --> 14:09.614
gets high enough to touch
the bottom of the van...

14:09.616 --> 14:11.616
A giant bathtub
and the van's the toaster.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.285
Bingo. Rubber tires are the
only thing keeping them alive.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.387
That's the solution-- tires!

14:18.124 --> 14:20.191
(electricity popping
and crackling)

14:25.332 --> 14:28.299
(muttering):
Uh, 22, 22 feet.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.651
18 degrees.

14:29.652 --> 14:31.002
Right here!
What are you doing?

14:31.004 --> 14:32.937
Geometry.
Okay, guys grab a bunch of tires

14:32.939 --> 14:35.106
from the garage
and stack them on this X!

14:35.108 --> 14:37.375
Hurry!

14:37.377 --> 14:41.012
We have no way to get to the gas
cutoff and the clock is ticking.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.914
What about that?

14:42.916 --> 14:44.916
The lifeguard ran off
to help somebody.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.050
I don't know
when he's gonna be back.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.919
Keys are in the ignition.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.287
That's stealing.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.623
Besides, I can barely drive
when I have sight.

14:51.625 --> 14:52.991
I won't be able to see
where I'm going!

14:52.993 --> 14:55.326
No, but I will.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.029
Turn left, hard!

14:58.031 --> 15:00.331
(tires screech)

15:00.333 --> 15:01.666
Everything's blurry!

15:01.668 --> 15:03.134
Straighten!

15:05.038 --> 15:06.204
I want to slow down.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.371
These are dangerous
canyon roads!

15:07.374 --> 15:08.940
We have to go
27 miles uphill.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.041
We can't go
slower than 50

15:10.043 --> 15:11.309
if we're gonna
get this done in time!

15:11.311 --> 15:12.443
Go faster!

15:12.445 --> 15:14.245
I told your mother
I'd keep you safe!

15:14.247 --> 15:15.346
What was that?!

15:15.348 --> 15:17.548
What are you doing
that's unsafe?

15:17.550 --> 15:18.650
I'm removing my comms, Mom.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.018
Sylvester can't see,

15:20.020 --> 15:21.586
so we can't have
distractions when driving.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.121
What?!

15:23.123 --> 15:24.289
Ralph?

15:24.291 --> 15:25.590
Sylvester?!

15:25.592 --> 15:27.125
I'd take my comms out,
too, if I we're you.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.426
She sounded mad.

15:30.196 --> 15:34.065
Oh, God, I am a dead man.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.668
Hey, I should really
hold that flashlight.

15:36.670 --> 15:37.568
Steady surgeon hands.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.170
You are a psychiatrist.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.706
General Surgery rotation,
Mass General.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.208
Neurosurgery sub-internship,
Harvard.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.277
Here.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.582
<i> Solenopsis Invicta.</i>

15:51.584 --> 15:52.951
What?

15:52.953 --> 15:54.118
Brazilian fire ants
that invaded SoCal

15:54.120 --> 15:56.321
decades ago in a
shipment of plums.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.423
Cracked water pipes must've
flooded their nests,

15:58.425 --> 16:00.291
so they formed a living raft
to protect the colony.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.626
Well, I hope that's not a
problem, 'cause the pipes

16:01.628 --> 16:04.162
go down to a sublevel--
now, how much do you want

16:04.164 --> 16:06.097
to bet that that's the hatch
that we need to get to

16:06.099 --> 16:07.465
under those thousands of ants?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.200
$1,800?

16:10.003 --> 16:12.036
I'm a gambling addict.

16:12.038 --> 16:15.039
But you'd never live to pay me,
'cause their bites carry

16:15.041 --> 16:16.708
a 25% chance of vomiting,
disorientation

16:16.710 --> 16:18.460
or anaphylactic shock.

16:18.461 --> 16:20.211
A thousand bites jacks up
those odds tremendously.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.715
Okay, uh,
so what do we do now?

16:23.717 --> 16:25.216
CABE:
Are you kidding me?

16:25.218 --> 16:27.452
Two geniuses getting
bested by insects.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.320
You've got a pocket
full of honey, Doc.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.655
If I can figure it out,
so can you.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.158
He's right!

16:34.160 --> 16:36.327
Kovelsky's to the rescue.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.232
The water's getting higher
and that out-of-control wire

16:41.234 --> 16:43.668
is gonna end up
hitting the van!

16:43.670 --> 16:45.169
Uh, a few more minutes!
We're on top of this!

16:45.171 --> 16:47.105
We're trained professionals!

16:51.478 --> 16:52.710
How you doing
with the tires?

16:52.712 --> 16:54.495
It's getting pretty tall.

16:54.496 --> 16:56.279
We're gonna need to get
the ladders from the garage.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.151
Hey, hey! Hey, man!
I'm right here!

17:00.153 --> 17:01.185
Better slow down.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.387
MAN:
Right here!

17:02.389 --> 17:03.721
What's that blurry thing
up ahead?

17:03.723 --> 17:05.089
Hey, hey, hey...

17:05.091 --> 17:06.124
Someone's in trouble.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.526
Slow down!
Hey, hey...

17:10.630 --> 17:12.397
Help me, please!

17:12.399 --> 17:13.765
We were sightseeing
when the quake hit!

17:13.767 --> 17:15.299
She's stuck in there!

17:15.301 --> 17:17.335
If a bad aftershock hits
next to this cliff,

17:17.337 --> 17:18.536
she could be buried alive.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.104
We need to get her out.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.273
It's pressing against my leg!

17:24.110 --> 17:26.077
I have an idea,
but we have to be fast

17:26.079 --> 17:29.213
or we'll never make it
to the gas line in time.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.082
You're gonna listen to a kid?

17:31.084 --> 17:32.650
Well, he's not a regular kid.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.756
Come on, you stupid bugs.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.426
For the record, if not
for my desire for plain creamer,

17:41.428 --> 17:43.094
you wouldn't have had
honey in your pocket

17:43.096 --> 17:44.629
and we wouldn't
have solved this, so...

17:44.631 --> 17:46.330
Are you seriously
taking credit for this?

17:46.332 --> 17:48.232
Just open the hatch.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.168
Though I doubt your ego's
gonna fit through the opening.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.135
Excuse me?

17:51.137 --> 17:53.171
Hmm?

17:57.243 --> 17:59.677
Okay, now that we've got
our skewer in place,

17:59.679 --> 18:01.746
we just need to finish
this "tire-kebab."

18:05.452 --> 18:06.451
CABE:
Uh-oh!

18:06.453 --> 18:07.552
We got oil dripping

18:07.554 --> 18:09.454
into the electrified water!

18:09.456 --> 18:13.224
Oil? Happy, if enough oil
collects, it will catch fire,

18:13.226 --> 18:15.226
and those people
will choke out from smoke.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.095
Or blow up if the flames
reach the fuel tank.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.730
Rate it's pouring out, I'd say
we've got about a minute

18:19.732 --> 18:21.566
before the van's
engulfed in fumes or fire.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.734
We can't leave them on there
and we can't get them off there.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.604
How the hell are we
gonna save these people?

18:31.544 --> 18:32.543
All right,
everybody to the back!

18:32.545 --> 18:34.312
Get away from the engine!

18:34.314 --> 18:35.480
Huddle up near
the rear windows.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.181
Happy, did you hear
what Cabe just said?

18:37.183 --> 18:38.516
Hell, can you even hear<i> me?</i>

18:38.518 --> 18:40.218
Barely-- the comms
aren't working great.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.719
Do you have an idea?
He said "huddle up."

18:41.721 --> 18:43.688
Just like the ants huddled up
on the water as the levels rose.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.723
You need to raise the water level.
Yes.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.492
Once the water reaches where
the oil leak is coming from,

18:47.494 --> 18:48.759
it will suffocate
potential flames,

18:48.761 --> 18:51.562
because you can't have
fire without oxygen,

18:51.564 --> 18:53.331
and there is
no oxygen underwater!

18:53.333 --> 18:55.566
You just stole my idea.
I finished your thought

18:55.568 --> 18:57.168
in an easy-to-follow way.
What is wrong with you today?

18:57.871 --> 18:59.804
Hold on, once the water reaches

18:59.806 --> 19:01.356
the wheel rim,

19:01.357 --> 19:02.907
won't the whole van
be electrified?

19:02.909 --> 19:05.209
As long as they don't touch
anything metal, they're safe.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.911
But if we kill the fire
risk by trapping them

19:06.913 --> 19:08.646
in an electrified box,
how does that help?

19:08.648 --> 19:09.847
One crisis at a time.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.149
Doc, we're going
with your idea.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.317
See?
<i> My</i> idea.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.420
And how do we raise
the water level?

19:16.422 --> 19:18.890
It's not like we can make
a busted pipe flow faster.

19:18.892 --> 19:21.159
Like my grandad used to say,
"You you can't raise the river,

19:21.161 --> 19:23.794
lower the boat."

19:23.796 --> 19:24.662
Oh, here we go.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.764
All right, back away

19:26.766 --> 19:28.733
and don't touch
anything metal!

19:33.540 --> 19:35.373
The van's going into the water--
it's working!

19:35.375 --> 19:37.175
All right...

19:37.177 --> 19:38.409
we gotta get
the rest of those tires.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.779
(gasping, groaning)

19:41.781 --> 19:44.382
God, still nothing
from 911!

19:44.384 --> 19:46.784
Rescue crews are inundated
with high-priority targets.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.953
Even if you could get
through, a low-volume rescue

19:48.955 --> 19:50.521
couldn't be prioritized.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.191
A little to the left for
the best mechanical advantage.

19:55.628 --> 19:56.961
Are you sure he knows
what he's doing?

19:57.964 --> 19:59.830
Absolutely.
He's first in his class.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.332
Where-- elementary school?

20:01.334 --> 20:04.202
Actually, Caltech...
and elementary school.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.837
Okay, Ralph,
we're ready.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.540
I'm gonna start pushing
up on the dash, okay?

20:13.513 --> 20:14.612
(shouts, grunting)

20:14.614 --> 20:16.347
That's normal pain associated

20:16.349 --> 20:17.815
with the release of pressure.

20:17.817 --> 20:18.883
Now slide your leg out.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.951
I can't.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.824
SYLVESTER:
Get out of there.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.492
Her pants are caught on metal.

20:28.494 --> 20:29.827
I know what to do.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.429
Ralph, get out of there!

20:31.431 --> 20:32.930
I need to cut her pants.

20:32.932 --> 20:36.567
This jack is meant to nestle
on a steel car frame!

20:36.569 --> 20:38.402
Not underneath
a plastic dash

20:38.404 --> 20:39.870
with a thousand-pound pine
on top!

20:39.872 --> 20:42.640
I'll be fast.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.009
(woman screams)

20:47.247 --> 20:50.982
Ralph, the jack is
beginning to give out!

20:52.418 --> 20:53.718
Hurry!

20:53.720 --> 20:55.620
She's clear!

20:55.622 --> 20:56.954
Ah!

20:56.956 --> 20:58.456
Ralph, it's starting to buckle!

21:00.426 --> 21:01.659
Hurry!

21:01.661 --> 21:03.461
(metal creaking)

21:05.331 --> 21:06.697
Ralph!

21:06.699 --> 21:08.599
Present.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.601
Oh...

21:10.603 --> 21:12.670
(gasping)

21:20.947 --> 21:22.446
Thank you.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.648
SYLVESTER:
I can tell by your stance

21:23.650 --> 21:26.350
that your leg is bruised,
but not broken.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.519
Your husband can
take you down to PCH

21:28.521 --> 21:29.787
and help you flag a ride.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.956
Okay.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.524
Take care of yourselves.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.995
Sylvester...

21:37.997 --> 21:39.997
we have a lot of time
to make up.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.365
But how are we
going to do that

21:41.367 --> 21:42.867
with a huge tree
blocking the way?

21:46.939 --> 21:50.041
Okay, Toby, angle the light
higher up ahead.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.475
Aw, it's too bad
I have the light now...

21:51.477 --> 21:52.643
No, no.
I see something.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.912
Oh, come on!

21:54.914 --> 21:58.616
Part of the ceiling
collapsed.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.051
Rays of light are getting
through to the other side.

22:00.053 --> 22:01.752
Rest of the tunnel's
still intact.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.054
Okay.

22:03.056 --> 22:05.056
So... we just push our way past.

22:05.058 --> 22:06.023
No, Toby. Toby, stop.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.059
That rubble
is holding up

22:08.061 --> 22:10.761
the rest of
a seismically induced cave-in.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.730
You move the wrong rock,

22:12.732 --> 22:14.031
and rest of the ceiling
could collapse on us.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.533
Okay, so what's your plan?

22:15.535 --> 22:17.068
Calculating
approximate weight

22:17.070 --> 22:18.769
and density of the rocks,

22:18.771 --> 22:21.605
based on the size
and the position

22:21.607 --> 22:24.575
in relation to
the pieces around it, so...

22:24.577 --> 22:26.610
If we can avoid
the load-bearing stones,

22:26.612 --> 22:29.046
then we can bring down
half of the wall

22:29.048 --> 22:30.981
without being buried alive.

22:30.983 --> 22:31.982
So let's start with

22:31.984 --> 22:33.617
that... that rock,

22:33.619 --> 22:35.119
right in front of you.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.587
Where the light is. Yep.

22:36.589 --> 22:39.056
(grunts)
See?

22:39.058 --> 22:41.359
Man, you love being right,
don't you?

22:44.097 --> 22:45.830
Okay, the, uh,
the-the brown one.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.499
(sniffs)

22:53.406 --> 22:54.839
I'm sorry.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.440
Huh?

22:56.442 --> 22:58.442
WALTER: For whatever I did
that made you so mad at me.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.811
I mean, I know
I have relationship problems.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.047
I barely speak to my parents;

23:03.049 --> 23:05.816
I can't date a woman
for more than a few months.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.452
But I-I... I do try to be
a cognizant friend

23:08.454 --> 23:11.622
to you,
to Happy, Sly...

23:11.624 --> 23:12.790
'cause we're supposed

23:12.792 --> 23:14.091
to understand each other.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.459
Okay.

23:15.461 --> 23:16.927
That flat rock,
right in front of you.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.095
Yeah, sure thing.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.064
But if I'm making you

23:20.066 --> 23:22.466
so upset to where

23:22.468 --> 23:27.104
you're arguing
with me about minutia,

23:27.106 --> 23:30.808
and I don't even know
what I'm doing wrong,

23:30.810 --> 23:34.111
then I'm not making
as much progress

23:34.113 --> 23:35.446
as what I thought.

23:35.448 --> 23:36.514
It's disheartening.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.052
Should squeeze through.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.888
(grunts)

23:43.890 --> 23:45.556
Come on.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.159
Think we should
try and run there?

23:48.161 --> 23:49.860
We both know that's not logical.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.462
You did the calculations.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.097
We'll make it over.
You're never wrong.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.132
I'm not scared
about my math being wrong,

23:55.134 --> 23:57.067
just my aim.
I can't see very well,

23:57.069 --> 23:58.602
and if I'm off by even an inch

23:58.604 --> 24:00.104
when we hit that ramp...
I know.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.506
That's why I'm standing
on the driver's side.

24:02.508 --> 24:03.974
Oh, boy.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.042
I'm scared, too.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.777
Mom always says
I'm an indoor cat,

24:06.779 --> 24:09.180
and sometimes that bothers me.

24:09.182 --> 24:10.915
It ever bother you?

24:10.917 --> 24:12.049
Yeah.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.118
And my dad said a lot worse.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.087
All right, Ralph.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.088
Let's be outdoor cats.

24:18.090 --> 24:21.058
Okay. But first...

24:21.060 --> 24:23.994
help me put these
water wings on my feet.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.663
Okay.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.498
Hands at ten and two.
Check.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.600
Seat belt on.
Check.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.602
Eyes focused on the ramp.
Check.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.471
Don't tell your mother.
Check.

24:36.108 --> 24:39.143
(engine revving)

24:44.050 --> 24:44.949
No! No!

24:44.951 --> 24:47.551
(screaming)

24:51.691 --> 24:52.690
(panting)

24:52.692 --> 24:55.226
(tires screeching)

24:58.164 --> 25:00.231
(air hissing)

25:01.601 --> 25:03.667
Thought that worked
on water contact.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.670
I sweat when nervous.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.239
Okay, that's the last of 'em!

25:08.241 --> 25:10.207
(rumbling)

25:10.209 --> 25:11.675
Aftershock!

25:11.677 --> 25:13.244
Cabe, grab the tires;
we'll grab the ladder!

25:17.149 --> 25:19.116
(whimpering)

25:19.118 --> 25:20.901
(electrical crackling)

25:20.902 --> 25:22.685
(woman screams)
Help us! Please, help us!

25:22.688 --> 25:25.689
(rumbling)

25:25.691 --> 25:27.191
(grunting)

25:27.193 --> 25:28.225
(rumbling fades)

25:28.227 --> 25:31.228
(panting)

25:31.230 --> 25:32.630
You okay?

25:32.632 --> 25:34.231
Yeah... my knee.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.966
I twisted it.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.001
You?
Ah...

25:37.003 --> 25:38.702
I rolled my right ankle.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.838
Get us out of here!

25:40.840 --> 25:42.873
Aftershock must've
set the van on fire.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.275
We need to get
this thing together

25:44.277 --> 25:45.809
or those people will
die in minutes.

25:45.811 --> 25:46.877
(coughing)

25:48.214 --> 25:50.281
Uh, question.

25:50.283 --> 25:52.216
We've got
seven minutes

25:52.218 --> 25:53.284
until that gas line goes up.

25:53.286 --> 25:54.285
How we gonna make it

25:54.287 --> 25:56.820
when we can
barely walk?

25:56.822 --> 25:58.889
♪ ♪

26:08.568 --> 26:09.667
There it is!

26:10.570 --> 26:11.735
Guys...

26:11.737 --> 26:13.137
we can't get
to the shut-off valve.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.138
It's locked.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.272
Sly, you have to get in!

26:15.274 --> 26:16.507
The gas line's hot,

26:16.508 --> 26:17.741
which means the pressure
is building up.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.276
If we don't cut off
the gas supply,

26:19.278 --> 26:20.811
the whole line will blow

26:20.813 --> 26:22.179
before we even get
under Koreatown.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.581
And we're down here with it.

26:30.323 --> 26:31.855
The lock won't break.

26:31.857 --> 26:32.990
I know.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.658
I'm drenched in sweat

26:34.660 --> 26:35.960
and there's
not even a dent.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.094
Hold on.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.863
Remember the last time
I was sweating?

26:39.865 --> 26:41.765
Run to the car
and get your life vest

26:41.767 --> 26:43.133
and a bottle of water.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.337
We're not gonna
make it at this pace.

26:46.339 --> 26:47.905
Yeah, I already did
that math. Okay, hold up.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.873
You know,
your left leg's bad

26:49.875 --> 26:51.008
and my right
hoof's busted?

26:51.010 --> 26:52.876
(grunts) If we
tie 'em together,

26:52.878 --> 26:55.913
then we take a little
pressure off each.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.915
Literally
joined at the hip.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.183
Eh, more like
the thigh and the calf.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.250
Right.

27:03.356 --> 27:04.622
Okay.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.293
I'm very uncomfortable.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.394
You and me both.
Let's go.

27:10.396 --> 27:11.629
(grunts)

27:11.631 --> 27:12.930
Okay. Left... right, left...

27:12.932 --> 27:14.898
But your left
is my right.

27:14.900 --> 27:15.933
It's not hard.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.735
Look...
Okay, no, it's no good.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.637
This is not gonna work.
This is not gonna work.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.705
We need something, uh, with a...

27:21.707 --> 27:23.641
a cadence, a rhythm, uh,

27:23.643 --> 27:26.010
something to walk in unison,
like in the military.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.311
I got an idea.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.946
And I hate it.

27:28.948 --> 27:31.215
Please!

27:31.217 --> 27:32.383
We can't breathe!

27:32.385 --> 27:33.984
All right, back away
from the door!

27:33.986 --> 27:35.352
We're gonna tip
this thing over!

27:35.354 --> 27:37.054
Happy, do I let 'er rip?

27:37.056 --> 27:38.456
Well, I'm no Sly,

27:38.457 --> 27:39.857
but I think my numbers are good.
Wait, wait, hold on.

27:39.859 --> 27:40.858
I think Walter and Toby
are saying something.

27:40.860 --> 27:41.859
It might be important.

27:41.861 --> 27:42.993
♪ More than words ♪

27:42.995 --> 27:45.095
♪ To show you feel ♪

27:45.097 --> 27:46.897

27:46.899 --> 27:49.066

27:49.068 --> 27:51.402
They have lost it.
HAPPY: Hey, nimrods,

27:51.404 --> 27:52.903
you're supposed to vent the gas,
not inhale it.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.672
You do your job,
we'll do ours.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.407
Speaking of which,
time to timber this thing.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.536
CABE:
Okay!

28:08.537 --> 28:10.187
The tires will insulate you
from the electricity!

28:10.189 --> 28:11.355
Now move!

28:11.357 --> 28:13.357
(coughs)

28:13.359 --> 28:14.792
If an aftershock hits

28:14.794 --> 28:16.326
while they are on that
bridge and they fall...

28:16.328 --> 28:17.461
Hey, don't even say it.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.698
CABE:
Okay, steady.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.733
That's it. One at a time.
That's it.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.002
HAPPY:
Uh, guys, fire's creeping

28:25.004 --> 28:26.036
closer to the fuel tank,

28:26.038 --> 28:27.104
which means "kaboom."

28:29.408 --> 28:31.241
That lake is spreading.
If it gets past that last tire,

28:31.243 --> 28:33.277
those two people are gonna be
stuck out there on the bridge.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.245
Okay, come on, everyone!
Pick up the pace!

28:36.382 --> 28:38.048
Come on, get away
from there, hustle!

28:39.385 --> 28:41.251
All right, buddy, you gotta
get out of that van!

28:41.253 --> 28:42.953
I can't.

28:42.955 --> 28:43.987
I'm gonna fall!

28:43.989 --> 28:45.422
You're gonna die if you don't!

28:45.424 --> 28:47.157
TOBY (over comms):
Wrong.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.126
Listen to me: Everyone
knows fight or flight.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.128
But there's a third
"F"-- freezing.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.863
In the face of danger,
some instincts believe

28:52.865 --> 28:54.431
that no action is better
than the wrong action.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.166
Someone's gonna
have to go get him.

28:56.168 --> 28:57.201
All right. I'm on it.

28:57.203 --> 28:58.402
Hey! Sorry!

28:58.404 --> 28:59.620
The bridge won't hold
both your weights.

28:59.621 --> 29:00.837
I'll go, I'm lighter.
PAIGE: No, no.

29:00.840 --> 29:01.939
L.A. needs genius minds today.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.140
I can't risk you going down.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.876
All right, we'll
steady the bridge.

29:08.981 --> 29:09.980
Okay, sir...

29:09.982 --> 29:11.482
we're gonna get you out of here.

29:11.484 --> 29:12.483
What's your name?

29:12.485 --> 29:14.384
It's Bryan.
Okay, Bryan.

29:14.386 --> 29:17.521
Bryan, look,
don't look out there.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.156
Look at me.
Look at me, okay?

29:19.158 --> 29:20.524
If I was able to cross
that bridge...

29:20.526 --> 29:22.393
(coughs)
...you can, too.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.261
(coughing)
CABE: Okay, the damn bridge

29:24.263 --> 29:26.163
is surrounded!
You guys gotta get out of there!

29:26.165 --> 29:27.865
Bryan, is there someone
you want to see again?

29:27.867 --> 29:29.399
My grandson.  Right,
your grandson.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.034
Well, he is not gonna
come visit us out here.

29:31.036 --> 29:32.202
And I can't leave
until you do,

29:32.204 --> 29:34.371
and if we don't go,
I die.

29:34.373 --> 29:35.405
I do not want to die!

29:35.407 --> 29:38.075
So move your ass now!

29:44.183 --> 29:46.049
You can do it.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.252
Okay, Paige,

29:48.254 --> 29:49.419
you got to get out of there.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.054
I thought you said two people

29:51.056 --> 29:52.322
on the bridge is dangerous.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.191
An exploding van
is more dangerous.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.492
Get going.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.461
Uh, the area around the gas tank

29:57.463 --> 29:58.746
is on fire.

29:58.747 --> 30:00.030
Come on, get on your
feet and run. Do it!

30:00.032 --> 30:00.931
Come on, hurry!

30:05.037 --> 30:06.236
Come on! Now!

30:13.445 --> 30:14.444
Are you okay?

30:14.446 --> 30:16.113
(sighs)

30:16.115 --> 30:18.882
I'm starting to miss
being a waitress.

30:20.052 --> 30:21.351
SYLVESTER: Okay, I think
I've got it set up

30:21.353 --> 30:22.820
right on the soldering marks

30:22.822 --> 30:23.987
where the chain is weakest.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.823
That's inspired problem solving.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.208
Only if it works.

30:27.209 --> 30:28.592
Get back to where it's safe,
all right, buddy?

30:29.461 --> 30:30.527
(hissing)
(whimpers)

30:33.499 --> 30:34.832
It worked!

30:37.503 --> 30:39.102
Okay.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.172
(grunting)

30:47.146 --> 30:49.246
(panting)

30:49.248 --> 30:50.480
It worked.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.049
The valve is shut.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.151
Quick. Open all the vents.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.153
Whoa, it's unreal
that we made it in time.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.855
I don't think we did.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.189
The pressure gauges
are at zero.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.391
The gas couldn't have vented
that fast already.

31:01.393 --> 31:02.392
(alarm blaring)

31:02.394 --> 31:03.393
That sound is bad, right?

31:03.395 --> 31:05.128
WALTER:
It's the gas detector.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.566
Oh, we're too late.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.602
The aftershock cracked the pipe.

31:11.604 --> 31:13.470
Who cares how the gas vents,
as long as the pipe

31:13.472 --> 31:14.605
won't explode?
Koreatown is saved.

31:14.607 --> 31:16.173
I still get
spicy noodle chicken.

31:16.175 --> 31:17.608
Now let's hop along
up that manhole ladder

31:17.610 --> 31:19.142
before we asphyxiate down here.

31:19.144 --> 31:20.878
Toby, Toby...

31:20.880 --> 31:22.179
we have a major issue.

31:22.181 --> 31:23.280
Okay...

31:23.282 --> 31:25.282
the ventilation down here
goes east.

31:25.284 --> 31:26.650
Straight to downtown.

31:26.652 --> 31:29.186
That cop's walkie-talkie
said downtown's burning.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.487
With the volume in the tunnels,

31:30.489 --> 31:32.623
gas moves
at four miles per hour.

31:32.625 --> 31:35.359
We have 17 minutes until
it reaches under the fires.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.095
Those fires plus this gas
equals bye-bye downtown.

31:38.097 --> 31:41.164
Guys, meet us at the corner
of Wilshire and Morell ASAP.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.166
You got it. What's the plan?

31:43.168 --> 31:46.236
To save the city, we're gonna
light the gas on fire ourselves.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.676
(siren wailing)

31:52.678 --> 31:54.311
I'm gonna have to build
a super-sized gas flare

31:54.313 --> 31:56.313
that can suck the excess gas
out of the tunnels

31:56.315 --> 31:57.681
like a vacuum,
similar to an oil field.

31:57.683 --> 32:00.951
Now, if we do that,
then it never reaches downtown.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.986
Happy, we need something

32:02.988 --> 32:04.988
that can launch
a streamlined projectile.

32:04.990 --> 32:06.657
I can get what I'll need
from any Dumpster. I'm on it.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.325
How the hell are you guys gonna
get there in time on foot?

32:08.327 --> 32:09.426
TOBY: We're not on foot.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.661
We kind of borrowed a car
from someone

32:10.663 --> 32:11.929
who was directing traffic

32:11.931 --> 32:12.996
when he wasn't looking.

32:12.998 --> 32:14.564
Do I hear sirens?

32:14.566 --> 32:16.366
Did you guys steal a cop car?

32:17.403 --> 32:19.102
Maybe.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.203
(siren wailing)

32:24.076 --> 32:25.208
All right,
first things first,

32:25.210 --> 32:26.243
we need to build
a makeshift chimney.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.244
How about that?

32:27.246 --> 32:28.612
Perfect.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.080
Okay, you move it
over the manhole.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.481
All right,
I'll take care of the crane.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.350
You get the manhole off.

32:38.223 --> 32:40.457
Oh, I didn't think
I'd be doing this twice today.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.028
(groans)

32:45.030 --> 32:46.196
(manhole cover clattering)

32:54.473 --> 32:56.373
Good. You're aligned.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.676
Yeah.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.313
Little to the right.

33:04.550 --> 33:05.482
Now drop it!

33:05.484 --> 33:07.250
Good!

33:07.252 --> 33:09.619
Perfect! Perfect!

33:13.525 --> 33:16.059
Come on! Come on!

33:18.163 --> 33:20.130
TOBY: A broken pool cue
and a plastic coat hanger?

33:20.132 --> 33:21.698
What the hell is that?
An atlatl,

33:21.700 --> 33:23.600
an ancient
Aztec spear-throwing device.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.535
Marvel of physics.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.304
And I'm gonna chuck
the crap out of it.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.605
There's an open
four-by-four hatch

33:28.607 --> 33:30.407
at the other end
of that thing, Cabe, so...

33:30.409 --> 33:31.341
make it count.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.176
All right.

33:40.753 --> 33:43.220
Kobe from downtown.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.455
(cheering)

33:45.457 --> 33:47.024
CABE:
Yeah!

33:47.026 --> 33:49.193
Yay!

33:49.194 --> 33:51.361
All the gas is being sucked
from the vent and burned off.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.263
It'll never reach downtown.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.198
They're gonna be looking
for that cop car.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.400
You gonna protect a brother?

33:56.402 --> 33:58.402
I think they'll understand.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.859
REPORTER:
<i> ...in what experts are calling</i>

34:05.860 --> 34:08.177
<i> the worst natural disaster</i>
<i> to hit Los Angeles in decades.</i>

34:08.180 --> 34:09.446
Although authorities
are saying

34:09.448 --> 34:10.747
things could've been
substantially worse

34:10.749 --> 34:12.182
if a massive gas leak

34:12.184 --> 34:14.251
hadn't been handled
in dramatic fashion...

34:14.253 --> 34:15.385
(radio winds down)

34:18.624 --> 34:20.557
30 minutes of cranking
for three minutes of sound.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.342
Great product.

34:22.343 --> 34:24.126
Oh, what a day. Even though
we were all separated,

34:24.129 --> 34:26.163
we were still able
to save the city.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.198
Even you two.

34:35.808 --> 34:37.274
Holy crow.

34:37.276 --> 34:40.510
Ralph, I was so worried
about you.

34:40.512 --> 34:41.812
I'm so glad you're okay.

34:41.814 --> 34:43.246
I'm glad you're okay, too.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.648
I heard from Toby and Walter

34:44.650 --> 34:46.349
you guys had some adventure,

34:46.351 --> 34:48.552
a pretty dangerous one,
at that.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.796
We had a massive quake.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.198
You took my son

35:01.200 --> 35:03.333
into the canyons,
drove on dirt roads

35:03.335 --> 35:04.568
half-blind

35:04.570 --> 35:06.169
near landslides and accidents...

35:07.739 --> 35:09.739
...and you brought him
home safe.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.276
Thank you.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.778
Oh, Ralphie?

35:14.780 --> 35:17.347
As for you, um...

35:18.750 --> 35:20.283
...you earned this.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.284
I can go kayaking?

35:21.286 --> 35:22.853
Well, it's got to be safer

35:22.855 --> 35:24.421
than driving with Sylvester,
and besides,

35:24.423 --> 35:25.555
you're not a typical kid.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.524
I have to stop
treating you like one.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.429
Nice work, outdoor cat.

35:33.332 --> 35:34.798
CABE:

36:48.874 --> 36:50.240
with Dr. Rizzuto.

36:50.242 --> 36:52.442
So maybe we should
finish them up?

36:53.378 --> 36:54.377
It's just, uh,

36:54.379 --> 36:55.779
since I was a kid,

36:55.781 --> 36:58.281
I, uh...

37:00.219 --> 37:02.686
...I never had many...

37:06.358 --> 37:07.624
I want to be a good friend

37:07.626 --> 37:09.426
and not drive people crazy.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.461
Oh, that's it,
I can't take the guilt anymore.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.863
Walter, you didn't do anything.

37:13.865 --> 37:16.900
Truth is, we both know I'm
a little self-destructive,

37:16.902 --> 37:18.368
and...

37:18.370 --> 37:19.869
lately I've been on this roll

37:19.871 --> 37:21.271
where I love my job,

37:21.273 --> 37:23.340
I'm even doing well
with the ponies,

37:23.341 --> 37:25.408
and I can sabotage myself
when I have all that I want.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.277
What is more
self-destructive

37:27.279 --> 37:29.579
than picking a fight
with your boss?

37:29.581 --> 37:31.681
Look, man, I've never been
happier in my life,

37:31.683 --> 37:33.283
and I don't know
how to handle that,

37:33.285 --> 37:34.584
so I become a pain
in the tuchas.

37:34.586 --> 37:35.986
That's on me.

37:35.988 --> 37:37.420
I'm sorry.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.256
Wow. That's messed up.

37:39.258 --> 37:41.558
Tell me about it.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.493
Maybe going back to Dr. Rizzuto
isn't a bad idea.

37:43.495 --> 37:44.761
Copy that.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.496
Want to go to Kovelsky's?

37:46.498 --> 37:49.332
Coffee with hazelnut?

37:49.334 --> 37:50.634
You know, I would,

37:50.636 --> 37:52.335
I-I just,
I'm exhausted from today,

37:52.337 --> 37:53.436
so rain check till tomorrow.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.405
Sure thing.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.307
Have a good night.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.448
HAPPY:
Really, Doc?

38:05.450 --> 38:07.851
You've really
never been happier?

38:14.459 --> 38:16.459
God as my witness,

38:16.461 --> 38:18.628
I'm not gonna do anything
to ruin this.
