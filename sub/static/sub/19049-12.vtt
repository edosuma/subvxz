00:05.572 --> 00:08.200
- Look what Charlie and I found.
- Look at this.

00:08.274 --> 00:11.732
Oh, God. Ahh! Get that away from me.
It reeks. What is that?

00:11.811 --> 00:13.745
- Dude, this is our mail.
- Look at that.

00:13.813 --> 00:16.373
- It was in the sewer.
- What is our mail doing in the sewer?

00:16.449 --> 00:19.976
I threw it in there. You turkeys never open it,
so I just started throwing it in the sewer.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.748
Why don't you just throw it into the trash?

00:21.821 --> 00:24.881
Because if I threw it in the trash,
you would find it and then yell at me.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.984
Besides, I certainly never expected
you guys to be rooting around in the sewer.

00:28.061 --> 00:31.462
Uh, yeah. That brings up another issue.
What are you two doing in the sewer?

00:31.531 --> 00:33.396
- We always go in the sewer.
- We hang out in the sewer.

00:34.434 --> 00:35.662
Why?

00:35.735 --> 00:37.760
Why? There's stuff down there.

00:37.837 --> 00:40.431
- Don't knock the sewer till you've tried the sewer.
- You find shit down there.

00:40.507 --> 00:43.442
- But how are you so clean?
- We take our clothes off so we don't get dirty.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.808
- You guys!
- Hang on a second, Dee. We're getting into something.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.312
Anything could be down there.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.406
- Big stuff.
- Rings, coins, nudity. That's part of the fun.

00:50.483 --> 00:53.611
The two of you are walking around in the
sewers naked looking for rings and coins?

00:53.686 --> 00:55.950
You feel it with your feet.
It's almost like clamming.

00:56.022 --> 00:58.718
- Okay, but, you guys -
- Dee, knock it off.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.022
I wanna know why these two
are rooting around in the sewer -

01:01.094 --> 01:02.493
My water just broke!

01:02.562 --> 01:05.497
- Drain could- What?
- I'm having a baby.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:40.300 --> 01:42.564
Out of my way. I've broken my water.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.728
There's a baby inside of me
running out of water. Look out!

01:44.804 --> 01:46.738
Dennis, that was amazing.
I've never seen anybody drive that fast.

01:46.806 --> 01:49.366
- You hit 120! 120!
- I almost stewed my drawers.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.309
She was screaming in my ear.
Probably screwed my transmission up.

01:52.378 --> 01:54.972
- Nice and easy. Here we go.
- Oh, yes. This is my ride.

01:55.048 --> 01:58.313
- They've done this before.
- Thank you. All done with you. You can go.

01:58.384 --> 02:02.184
Where's the guy?
Should we call the guy? The guy who -

02:02.255 --> 02:03.813
Oh, no. That guy. There's no guy.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.017
- There's no guy?
- There's no guy. It's complicated.

02:06.092 --> 02:09.220
There's gotta be a guy.
We'll go get the guy. We'll get the dad.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.559
Why don't you guys do what you do best
and don't care, okay?

02:11.631 --> 02:14.156
I got it from here.
We can take it from here. Right, Michael?

02:14.234 --> 02:16.702
- Yeah.
- Michael and I got it. Thanks, guys.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.399
All right. Kind of rude...

02:19.472 --> 02:21.997
but I guess if we're off the hook,
let's head back to the bar.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.508
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I could get blitzed.

02:23.576 --> 02:25.567
No. Wait. Stop, guys. This is not right.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.738
Something is not right here.
This is very suspicious.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.372
- What?
- There's no guy in the picture?

02:29.449 --> 02:31.644
- So what?
- There's no dad in the picture.

02:31.718 --> 02:34.380
The brunt of the responsibility
of this kid is gonna fall on us.

02:34.454 --> 02:35.921
We're gonna have to do everything.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.752
- Ooh.
- You're right.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.156
Dee is like the most irresponsible person
on the planet.

02:40.226 --> 02:42.160
Look what she was doing with the mail,
for Christ sakes.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.219
Oh, my God!
We're gonna be in charge of the kid?

02:44.297 --> 02:46.231
This kid cannot become our responsibility.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.790
Look what this kid has ruined already.
He's ruined my transmission.

02:48.868 --> 02:50.859
- Yeah.
- He's ruined a perfectly good sewer conversation.

02:50.937 --> 02:53.098
- I still wanna get to the bottom of that one.
- Right.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.107
- We will.
- God knows what he's gonna ruin in the future.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.972
He's going to ruin everything.

02:57.043 --> 02:59.637
- We gotta find the dad! We gotta find that dad.
- You're right.

02:59.712 --> 03:01.771
- Let's find the dad.
- It's the dad's responsibility.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.406
- Let's find the dad.
- Yeah. Okay.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.110
I wonder if the dad even knows.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.709
I'll bet she's embarrassed -

03:06.786 --> 03:09.584
too embarrassed to tell us
because she's bedded some real stinkers.

03:09.656 --> 03:13.456
- She might not even know herself.
- There's always overlap.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.825
Any multiple number of sperms
could have gone up there and eaten the egg.

03:16.896 --> 03:19.421
- There could be so many dads.
- No, sperm doesn't eat the egg.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.763
It doesn't eat the egg
and grow strong and become a baby?

03:21.834 --> 03:24.268
Either way, she's pregnant and it's a guy,
so let's get him.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.929
Why don't we just round up
the usual suspects...

03:26.005 --> 03:27.563
and then we'll figure out how many of them -

03:27.640 --> 03:29.574
- Somebody's gotta stay here with her.
- You think so?

03:29.642 --> 03:31.234
- You're right. Yeah.
- You're right. Yeah.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.472
And it looks like it's gonna be you.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.515
- Why? What happened?
- Well, mostly because we're all on this side.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.313
- You're over there.
- Just 'cause you guys made it to one side before me?

03:39.385 --> 03:41.319
You didn't make it to this side on time.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.981
- Also, now we're backing out and you're stuck there.
- I can back out.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.322
- We'll find the dad.
- You better find that dad. This is not fair.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.690
Keep your eye on her.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.502
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Get down!

03:58.571 --> 04:00.505
I'm trying to make the TV go.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.507
You are standing on top of a rolling chair.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.873
You're gonna go flying through that window,
for God sakes. Get down.

04:04.944 --> 04:06.969
- I'm serious. You get down, Dee.
- All right, all right.

04:07.046 --> 04:10.641
- Oh, my- What are you thinking?
- I'm trying to watch my stories.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.651
I have a very specific birth plan...

04:12.719 --> 04:15.153
and mostly it involves me
watching my stories to relax...

04:15.221 --> 04:17.620
but I can't get this goddamn TV
to do anything.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.214
What are you -
Are you- Knock it off.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.817
- I'm mad at the -
- Stop straining yourself.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.327
Go lie down. Lie down now.

04:23.396 --> 04:25.364
This is exactly
what I was worried about, Dee.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.399
I am going to have to do everything...

04:27.467 --> 04:29.458
because you're an irresponsible person...

04:29.535 --> 04:32.868
who stands atop rolling chairs
and chooses to go flying through windows.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.497
Have the baby first.

04:34.574 --> 04:37.099
Have the stupid baby.
Then go flying through all the windows you like.

04:37.176 --> 04:38.666
Oh, my- Just lie there.

04:38.745 --> 04:41.373
Wait for the doctor. I will get your stories.

04:41.447 --> 04:45.042
God, this baby is becoming
such an irritating thing to me.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.814
- Yeah.
- God, what an irritating thing babies are.

04:47.887 --> 04:50.219
Oh, my goodness.
I'm having to do everything.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.554
I'll figure you out, you son of a bitch.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.331
Where is everybody?
I thought this was supposed to be a party.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.698
They'll be here. You're early.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.361
Do you have anything to drink?

05:04.437 --> 05:06.598
The salt on the chips dries out my mouth.

05:06.673 --> 05:09.369
I'll poke around the fridge and see
if there's anything. Where's the beer?

05:09.442 --> 05:11.842
- I forgot the beer. I'm sorry.
- You didn't bring the beer?

05:11.911 --> 05:14.402
How are we supposed
to know this is a party if there's no beer?

05:14.480 --> 05:17.643
- I got wrapped up in the invitations.
- A party with no beer.

05:17.717 --> 05:19.708
- We don't want them thinking
it's an interrogation.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.515
Oh! Hey!

05:21.587 --> 05:24.112
Party! Party! All right! Hey!

05:24.190 --> 05:26.954
- Hey, Cricket.
- Ooh. Where's the booze at? What's up, fellas?

05:27.026 --> 05:29.051
- Hey.
- Who invited Cricket?

05:29.128 --> 05:31.756
I did, because I figured it's a wild card.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.628
That's a stone you can leave unturned.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.668
We don't have time for that bullshit.
Let's just pick one and go.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.863
Hey, Bill? Could we talk to you for a sec?

05:38.938 --> 05:41.099
- Maybe, uh, in this -
- Oh, yeah? Yeah. Let's do this.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.608
A little guy time. Guy time.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.702
All right, let's turn it up. Whoo!

05:46.779 --> 05:49.441
Let's get weird, buddy. Let's get weird.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.382
- Thanks for coming to the party, Bill.
- Thanks for having me, guys.

05:52.452 --> 05:55.580
It's good to get away from the wife and kids
for a little bit- let the hair down.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.816
So you're still with your wife
after all that shit with Dee?

05:57.890 --> 06:00.552
Yeah, well, I realized I was a sex addict.

06:00.626 --> 06:02.821
I went to therapy. She forgave me for it.

06:02.895 --> 06:05.227
Oh, you're a sex addict, huh?

06:05.298 --> 06:08.199
That's crazy to be one of those.

06:08.267 --> 06:10.667
- You don't mind if I write some of this down, do you?
- For what?

06:10.737 --> 06:12.967
- Just keeping a log of the party. We like to do that.
- Oh.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.064
A funny conversation pops up,
you wanna remember it.

06:15.141 --> 06:18.838
No problem. Speaking of parties,
you guys wanna do a little -

06:18.911 --> 06:22.005
- Is that coke?
- Yeah. I picked up a couple grams on the way over.

06:22.081 --> 06:24.709
- Yeah, maybe a little bit later, we can all partake.
- Hey!

06:24.784 --> 06:27.753
But for now we're just a bunch of guys
hanging out in a room.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.448
- Right on.
- You know, dudes. Let's talk about dude stuff.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.354
I like dude stuff. Like what?

06:32.425 --> 06:35.690
Oh, I don't know.
What do guys talk about? Condoms.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.526
- Right.
- I cannot stand the feel of a condom on my dick.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.032
- I hate condoms. Hate 'em, hate 'em, hate 'em, hate 'em.
- Yeah.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.159
The three of us just don't use 'em.
How about you?

06:43.236 --> 06:45.170
Me neither. I can't stand them.

06:45.238 --> 06:49.038
Well, that's interesting.
A sex addict who doesn't like condoms.

06:49.108 --> 06:51.838
That's why I had a vasectomy, guys.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.674
You had a vasectomy?

06:53.746 --> 06:54.804
Yep.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.111
You just winked when you said that.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.743
Did you have a vasectomy or not?

06:59.819 --> 07:02.049
No.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.521
But that's what I would tell the ladies
so I didn't have to wear a condom.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.615
Oh!

07:06.692 --> 07:09.126
- Okay. That is incredibly shady.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:09.195 --> 07:11.129
What a beautiful underhanded thing.

07:11.197 --> 07:12.528
- Yeah.
- It's disgusting.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.362
- You guys wanna do a bump or what?
- I'll have a bump.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.768
I don't understand why there's not
a single room in this hospital...

07:20.840 --> 07:22.569
- I don't know where -
- That has a working television.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.200
I want that room now.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.745
I don't know where you think
I'm gonna get it from. I don't have any.

07:26.813 --> 07:31.841
If you do not get my sister her stories
and a new room as soon as possible...

07:31.918 --> 07:36.321
then I will come down on this hospital
like the hammer of Thor.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.916
The thunder of my vengeance
will echo through these corridors...

07:39.992 --> 07:43.587
like the gust of a thousand winds!

07:43.663 --> 07:46.928
You know what? I don't have time for this.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.557
I ain't going to jail over you.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.864
I will beat your ass and think nothing of it.

07:50.937 --> 07:54.668
I'm not doing this with you today.
I'm not! I'm not!

07:54.740 --> 07:57.709
What's the word on my stories?

07:57.777 --> 08:01.406
- Why are you not in bed?
- I slipped out for a quick sandwich and a soda.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.939
- You left the hospital?
- Yeah. I was kind of hungry. Mostly I was just getting bored.

08:05.017 --> 08:07.178
Dee, get in your room. You're drive- I -

08:07.253 --> 08:09.187
It's so boring.
There's nothing going on in there.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.621
You get in your room. Get in there.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.660
- Don't push me though, because I'm
pregnant and I don't... Get in the bed.

08:14.727 --> 08:16.285
- Wait a sec. What's this?
- I don't know.

08:16.362 --> 08:18.125
Why is there a strange man in my room?

08:18.197 --> 08:21.257
They probably slid this man in here thinking
that you were never gonna use the room.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.997
I don't want there to be a strange man
laying in my room who looks dead.

08:25.071 --> 08:27.733
- Is he dead, Dennis?
- I'm sure he's just sleeping. Get in bed.

08:27.807 --> 08:31.072
- I'm gonna scream in his face and see if he wakes up.
- Do not scream in the man's face.

08:31.143 --> 08:34.544
I'll jiggle his ankle, and that will
determine whether he's alive or not.

08:34.614 --> 08:37.481
Excuse me, sir. Are you -
You're very cold. He's very cold.

08:37.549 --> 08:42.078
- Okay. Hey, you! Wake up right now if you're not dead!
- All right, damn it, Dee. Stop.

08:42.154 --> 08:45.146
Oh, God. I think he's dead.
I think he's dead, Dennis. He's definitely dead.

08:45.224 --> 08:50.423
Why would they put a dead old man with paper
skin in my room when I'm trying to give birth?

08:50.496 --> 08:53.260
Because you weren't using the room, Dee,
and the hospital's very full.

08:53.332 --> 08:55.266
This was not part of my birth plan.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.268
This was not part of my birth plan, sir.

08:57.336 --> 08:59.270
Get the nurse and get him out of here.

08:59.338 --> 09:02.068
Getting the nurse is not gonna do any good.
That woman is stubborn as shit.

09:02.141 --> 09:04.541
- Well, do something 'cause this is upsetting me.
- All right! All right!

09:04.610 --> 09:06.601
- It's upsetting the baby.
- I hate all the responsibility that I have...

09:06.679 --> 09:08.237
that this baby is causing me.

09:08.314 --> 09:12.080
I will get this man out of your room.
I will think of something awesome.

09:15.454 --> 09:19.515
So things got pretty hot and heavy
with you and Dee back in the day, correct?

09:19.592 --> 09:22.618
- That was over a year ago?
- Yeah. She wasn't very nice to me.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.721
What are we looking at?
No contact with Dee after you dated.

09:25.798 --> 09:30.758
- What's the deal here, bud?
- Well, no, she contacted me for a while...

09:30.836 --> 09:32.326
usually when she was drunk.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.965
- Drunken late-night booty calls?
- Mm-hmm.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.532
No. She usually just yells at me...

09:37.610 --> 09:41.171
calls me names like army jerk, camo turkey.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.511
I know she's just drunk, so it's okay.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.517
Not okay. Not okay at all.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.985
- You gotta stand up for yourself, man.
- So you haven't slept with her?

09:48.054 --> 09:50.215
Sometimes she tricks me.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.780
She tricks you? She tricks you how?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.693
To give her sex.

10:00.533 --> 10:03.627
She's a very manipulative person.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.305
I'm- I'm sorry.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.399
Are you guys mad at me?

10:10.476 --> 10:13.001
- No, man, we're not mad -
- No.

10:13.079 --> 10:16.014
- I mean- You know.
- Okay.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.380
- Get a grip, but -
- Okay.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.682
- There's a room full of dudes out
there, so you might wanna... Yeah.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.813
stop crying before you come
back out to the party.

10:23.889 --> 10:27.757
Pull it together, because you're a soldier
and you should be tougher.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.385
Let's go.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.329
- Thanks, guys.
This is the guy that's defending our country?

10:32.398 --> 10:34.559
- Well, he's definitely a candidate.
- Oh, boys.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.898
- The keg has arrived.
- Hey, Frank.

10:36.969 --> 10:40.564
This power outlet is gonna explode,
and you're gonna have to deal with that.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.007
- Duncan, go with it, baby.
- Yeah, let's go for it.

10:45.277 --> 10:48.269
Yo, Frank, we gonna set it off, bitch.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.076
What are your bridge friends doing here?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.617
You gotta give it the illusion of a party.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.778
It's gotta be a guy's night, that's why.

10:54.854 --> 10:58.449
- Are you high on blow?
- Whatever Duncan gave me.

10:58.524 --> 11:01.357
- You don't even know what you're high on?
- No. Hey!

11:01.427 --> 11:04.362
Yo, Charlie Chuckles,
what's crackin', sunshine? Yeah.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.796
- Hey. L'il Kev.
- Hey, L'il Kev.

11:06.866 --> 11:09.130
And your beer.

11:09.201 --> 11:11.226
Ah. I'll talk to you guys later.

11:11.303 --> 11:13.237
Okay. Okay.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.704
What is L'il Kev doing here?

11:14.774 --> 11:16.799
You gotta throw out a big net...

11:16.876 --> 11:18.935
to catch the fish that she was banging.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.445
- Oh. Oh!
- Oh!

11:21.514 --> 11:24.210
- Party!
- It's a party, yo.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.843
Is that the busboy
from the Korean restaurant?

11:26.919 --> 11:28.944
Yeah, yeah. She banged him.

11:33.626 --> 11:37.323
Are you sure we're not taking
this Weekend at Bernie's thing too far?

11:37.396 --> 11:40.661
- I'm worried the sunglasses are ridiculous.
- The sunglasses lighten the mood.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.758
Make the whole thing feel like a fun, fun romp.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.769
- Hi.
- Hi, ladies. Hi. Yeah.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.532
- Good afternoon.
- Without the sunglasses...

11:46.605 --> 11:48.038
Weekend at Bernie's
would have been very dark.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.597
- Yeah. Strange movie.
- Strange tale.

11:49.675 --> 11:51.404
Hey there, Mr. Craig.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.076
Okay.

11:55.147 --> 11:58.378
- The waving thing's awesome, that's true.
- It's pretty sweet, right?

11:58.451 --> 11:59.884
What's our plan here?

11:59.952 --> 12:02.819
Are we just gonna throw him in the trash
or find a laundry chute...

12:02.888 --> 12:04.480
- Fire him down that?
- What? No.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.991
I'm gonna drop him in one of these rooms
if I can find an empty one.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.323
But that way, somebody could find him
and put him back in my room.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.523
That's a good point. Maybe we can stuff him
in a drawer or jam him in a closet.

12:12.598 --> 12:15.499
- That'll buy us some time, right? - Mm-mmm.
Makes me feel like I have to touch him.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.196
I don't wanna touch him at all.
Why don't we just put him in the trash?

12:18.270 --> 12:20.204
Please don't put me in the trash.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.365
- Oh!
- Oh, are you alive?

12:22.441 --> 12:23.874
- Oh, my goodness.
- Whoa.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.776
What is going on here?
What are you doing with Mr. Craig?

12:26.846 --> 12:28.609
They're trying to put me in the trash.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.512
- Don't- No.
- You know what?

12:30.583 --> 12:33.609
I refuse to share a room with an old man
who likes to pretend to be dead.

12:33.686 --> 12:36.553
- He's a liar.
- You are not allowed to move the patients.

12:36.622 --> 12:37.611
- Ooh!
- What? What?

12:37.690 --> 12:39.817
- Oh, Dennis. Oh, my God.
- What?

12:39.892 --> 12:41.792
- I think I'm having this baby.
- Doctor!

12:41.861 --> 12:45.490
Oh! It doesn't feel good.
This sucks. This sucks a bag of dicks.

12:45.564 --> 12:47.259
- Oh, I'm sure.
- Oh, man! Oh!

12:47.333 --> 12:49.631
- Help my sister.
- Wait, wait, wait. Don't leave me.

12:49.702 --> 12:50.964
- I don't like it.
- No, I'm coming.

12:51.036 --> 12:52.867
- We got you from here. We got you.
- I'm coming with you.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.530
You ain't going nowhere.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.235
Get your narrow ass back in that waiting room
before I knock you in there.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.641
You have done enough today.

12:59.712 --> 13:03.876
Crazy-ass white boy steadily dressing up folk
and talking about Thor.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.713
I bet I earned this. I got you.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.620
Wow. This whole thing's
really setting in now.

13:10.689 --> 13:13.249
Yeah, it's really sinking in, man.

13:13.325 --> 13:15.316
We're gonna have a baby. This is really cool.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.089
Please don't throw me in the trash.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.757
No one's putting you in the trash.
Stop saying that. Will you stop?

13:19.832 --> 13:23.700
# Everybody's talking
all this stuff about me #

13:23.769 --> 13:26.704
- Man, I used to have
some jean shorts like that too.

13:26.772 --> 13:28.899
I slept in them shits, man.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.943
Eventually,
I blew the crotch out of them things.

13:32.011 --> 13:35.538
But you can't wear 'em every day
and expect for 'em to hold up.

13:35.614 --> 13:37.775
That was some nice-ass denim too.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.545
I miss them shorts.

13:39.618 --> 13:42.587
But you gotta take 'em off
every now and then.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.590
You gotta take 'em off, son.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.751
Why are you having sex with her?

13:47.827 --> 13:51.627
Well, she gets drunk and calls me
a cardio-jerk or a workout turkey.

13:51.697 --> 13:53.722
And after a while, I just kind of cave in.

13:53.799 --> 13:56.290
Wow. You just -
I gotta try that with someone.

13:56.368 --> 13:57.733
- Thanks, Rex.
- Thank you.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.236
- Enjoy the party.
- Thanks, Rex.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.432
She's just berating these guys
into having sex with her.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.806
Yeah, and she is slammin' ass all over town.
She's getting way more action than us.

14:04.877 --> 14:08.040
She's stuck on her curse words.
"Jerk" and "turkey" are all that she's using.

14:08.113 --> 14:10.479
Well, clearly they're working for her,
'cause Rex is a quality lay.

14:10.549 --> 14:13.313
Yeah, Re -
Well, he's not fit to be a father though.

14:13.385 --> 14:17.549
A father? None of these guys
are fit to be fathers. They're animals.

14:17.623 --> 14:19.989
Even if we do figure out who it is...

14:20.059 --> 14:22.653
how are we gonna trust this baby
with one of these monkeys?

14:22.728 --> 14:24.719
They're animals. They got no self-control.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.630
It takes discipline to raise a kid, you know?

14:27.700 --> 14:30.726
- You gotta set rules. You gotta set ground rules.
- Set some boundaries.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.670
Like don't have 'em doing cocaine.

14:33.739 --> 14:36.970
- Get them off the Internet.
- The Internet's a very, very dangerous place.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.567
Kids spend all their time on the Internet.
"Hi. Who are you?

14:39.645 --> 14:41.613
There's your penis and there's your butt."

14:41.680 --> 14:45.081
- You gotta learn from some books.
- You don't want 'em reading too many books.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.277
- You don't want 'em to be a nerd.
- You don't want 'em to be a nerd.

14:47.353 --> 14:50.015
- I'm not raising a nerd, bro.
- If it's a nerd, I'm gonna bash his head in.

14:50.089 --> 14:52.182
- Nerds get nowhere in life.
- Oh, my God. Is he a nerd?

14:52.258 --> 14:54.249
I could bash some nerds right now.

14:54.326 --> 14:57.295
Right after this we should probably
bash nerds. I gotta get it out of my system.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.126
Bash some nerds.

14:59.198 --> 15:00.790
- Absolutely.
- Get bowed up.

15:00.866 --> 15:04.029
- You gotta teach him how to beat nerds up.
- He's gotta be beating nerds up.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.536
These are good ideas for raising a kid.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.094
We have a lot of ideas about raising a kid.

15:07.172 --> 15:10.005
We are men who can be great dads.
We have great opinions.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.009
And that's all that parenting is -

15:12.077 --> 15:13.510
pretending you know
what you're talking about...

15:13.579 --> 15:15.308
and then jamming it down a kid's throat.

15:15.381 --> 15:16.973
Oh, my God.
That's what we're gonna do.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.983
When I see that baby, dude,
we're gonna run towards it.

15:19.051 --> 15:21.781
- I'm gonna grab it. I'm gonna pick him up.
- And jam shit down his throat!

15:21.854 --> 15:23.788
- Dude.
- Dude, we're gonna be the dad.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.347
- We're so much better dads than these guys.
- Yeah, look at this.

15:26.425 --> 15:30.327
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

15:30.396 --> 15:32.455
Oh!

15:37.903 --> 15:41.498
I can't wait to tell him.
This is so exciting. There he is.

15:41.573 --> 15:44.474
Hey, Dennis, Dennis.
We have news. We have wonderful news.

15:44.543 --> 15:48.309
Charlie and I have decided that we
are going to be the father of this child.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.075
Dude, we did a complete 180.

15:50.149 --> 15:52.140
You guys, I did a 180 too. I totally did.

15:52.217 --> 15:54.845
I was all pissy this morning
about having to be at the hospital.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.981
Then I realized I've been firing
on all cylinders because of this baby thing.

15:59.058 --> 16:02.186
Dude, I did this
Weekend at Bernie's operation earlier...

16:02.261 --> 16:04.229
that would have blown you guys' minds -
it was very effective.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.265
Then I busted out this sweet Thor line
on this lady because she was pissing me off.

16:07.333 --> 16:10.928
It was, like, boom! I really hit her with it.
And I never reference the Nordic gods.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.597
- I don't understand what your point is.
- What are you talking about?

16:13.672 --> 16:15.503
I'm saying I wanna be the dad too.
I'm totally into it.

16:15.574 --> 16:17.838
- Okay.
- That steps on our thing a little bit, but -

16:17.910 --> 16:21.641
- 'Cause we were doing the... Maybe
instead of doing a My Two Dads type thing...

16:21.714 --> 16:25.206
we could fold in another dad
and do a Three Men and a Baby type situation.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.582
- That's what it is. I like that.
- An equally effective movie.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.053
- A great movie.
- Did we miss it? Did we miss it?

16:30.122 --> 16:32.716
No. It was -
What's going on? Who are all these people?

16:32.791 --> 16:35.817
I couldn't decide who the dad was,
so I brought everybody.

16:35.894 --> 16:39.295
You didn't try and decide who the dad was.
You just got high.

16:39.365 --> 16:41.925
Well, the interrogation
did turn into a coke party.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.026
But they all promised to have blood tests.

16:44.103 --> 16:47.766
If this kid is mine,
I'm gonna blow my brains out.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.741
Oh, he got zooted, man.
He took an eight-ball to the dome.

16:50.809 --> 16:54.802
No, no, Frank.
Dude, get these guys out of here, all right?

16:54.880 --> 16:57.314
- We're gonna be the father of the baby now.
- We're gonna be the fathers.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.943
- It has been decided, so sayeth Thor.
- Thor said it.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.213
- The who?
- Thor.

17:01.286 --> 17:02.981
- Who Thor?
- Is that your Greek God reference?

17:03.055 --> 17:04.521
- He's a Nordic God.
- Nordic God.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.990
I said something else earlier
that sounded a lot cooler than that.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.583
That one didn't really work.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.026
Guys, here she comes. She's coming.

17:11.096 --> 17:13.564
How do we make it a big moment?
I wanna make it a big moment.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.566
With music.
Duncan, play something special.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.659
- Frank, I got the perfect thing.
- Okay, great.

17:17.736 --> 17:21.262
- Why do they have the -
- I don't know.

17:48.067 --> 17:52.128
# Pray God you can cope #

17:52.204 --> 17:55.230
# I'll stand outside #

17:55.307 --> 17:57.639
# This woman's work #

17:57.709 --> 18:00.542
# This woman's world #

18:00.612 --> 18:04.810
# Ooh, it's hard on the man #

18:04.883 --> 18:08.444
# Now his part is over #

18:08.520 --> 18:11.819
# Now starts the craft #

18:12.357 --> 18:17.693
# Of the father #

18:17.763 --> 18:21.665
# I know you have a little life in you yet #

18:21.733 --> 18:23.166
# I know you have a lot #

18:23.235 --> 18:25.465
Carmen? What are you doing here?

18:25.537 --> 18:28.199
- I'm here to get my baby.
- What?

18:28.273 --> 18:30.969
Oh, yeah. The tranny's the dad.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.977
Yeah!

18:33.045 --> 18:36.412
- You had sex with the tranny?
- No. I was their surrogate.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.848
We used her sperm and a donor egg...

18:38.917 --> 18:41.215
and then they just kind of -
right up there and -

18:41.286 --> 18:44.278
We had a difficult time finding a surrogate,
but Dee was a miracle to us.

18:44.356 --> 18:47.018
I can't have kids of my own,
and Carmen always wanted a baby.

18:47.092 --> 18:50.186
Yeah, yeah. Great, great. Miracle for you.
How wonderful. Dee, you tricked us?

18:50.262 --> 18:53.425
- How did I trick you?
- We were getting all pumped up about being this baby's dad.

18:53.499 --> 18:54.989
We were all keyed up for nothing.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.160
If we knew you were doing
this stupid surrogate thing again...

18:57.236 --> 18:59.227
we would have just completely ignored
your pregnancy.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.329
You did ignore my pregnancy.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.567
This has been a huge disappointment for us.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.008
- Why?
- We were gonna be great dads.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.636
We were gonna impose our will on the kid.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.772
We had
a Three Men and a Baby thing going on.

19:09.848 --> 19:11.907
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- I have to admit...

19:11.984 --> 19:13.679
this whole thing might be for the best.

19:13.752 --> 19:16.949
Those two are gonna make great parents,
much better parents than any of us would.

19:17.022 --> 19:20.719
- Don't you think?
- Yeah. I guess.

19:20.792 --> 19:23.784
- A baby would've screwed up our chemistry.
- It might've. Yeah.

19:23.862 --> 19:26.330
We got a good thing going.
Why blow it with a baby?

19:26.398 --> 19:29.629
That being said, don't get
knocked up anymore, Dee. It's getting old.

19:29.701 --> 19:31.396
Oh, yeah. I didn't enjoy any of it.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.870
So, what I'm confused on is...

19:33.939 --> 19:37.568
the mother is the father
and the father is black...

19:37.643 --> 19:40.009
- And the baby's not black, so -
- It's all been explained.

19:40.078 --> 19:42.069
- Yeah.
- I'll talk you through it later.

19:42.147 --> 19:44.206
Then what is your deal?
Do we pop you back in there?

19:44.283 --> 19:46.274
Are you done having babies? What's going on?

19:46.351 --> 19:48.717
Can you take me to go get a beer?
I need a beer.

19:48.787 --> 19:51.255
I could go for a beer.
You guys wanna go back to the bar?

19:51.323 --> 19:53.052
- Yeah!
- Hey, you guys.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.821
Let's bring the party back to the bar.
Bring the music. Let's go.

19:55.894 --> 19:58.260
- What the hell's happening back there?
- A few buddies came along.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.798
- Don't worry about it, Dee.
- Oh! Let's party in the sewer.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.164
- Oh, yeah, Charlie.
- I'm not going into a sewer.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.759
What is your obsession
with the sewer these days?

20:04.836 --> 20:06.497
- You find great stuff down there.
- Like what?

20:06.572 --> 20:08.631
- Like sewage.
- Ha-ha! Good one, Dee.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.675
She's back, baby. She's back.

20:10.742 --> 20:12.676
Supposing it's storming
and a guy loses his ring...

20:12.744 --> 20:14.405
- Is this the ring story again?
- And it goes into the gutter?

20:14.479 --> 20:17.812
You gotta come up with something else, Frank.
You can't keep using the same -

20:17.883 --> 20:21.375
Like, give me some crack.
You know what I'm sayin', dawg?

20:21.453 --> 20:22.511
We'll get more.

20:23.305 --> 20:29.277
