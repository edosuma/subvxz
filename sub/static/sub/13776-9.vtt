WEBVTT

00:01.730 --> 00:03.175
Clean release.

00:07.349 --> 00:08.292
WHere's the water?

00:12.068 --> 00:13.738
Oh, come on.

00:13.858 --> 00:16.492
Where is it?
Where's the thing?

00:16.494 --> 00:18.461
You're kidding me.

00:18.463 --> 00:25.301
Oh... oh, shoot.
Do it!

00:25.303 --> 00:28.204
Come on, you son of a...
Is it this?

00:28.206 --> 00:31.307
Is this it?
Is it both at the same...

00:33.244 --> 00:38.948
Ho... Come on.
Balls!

00:42.519 --> 00:43.353
I-I don't understand what it
is.

00:43.355 --> 00:45.321
I put my hands there.
I'm waving them underneath the

00:45.323 --> 00:47.357
automatic faucet-- nothing's
happening.

00:47.359 --> 00:49.359
And then I'm stuck there with
soap all over my hands.

00:49.361 --> 00:51.361
You're just not
turning it on right.

00:51.363 --> 00:52.996
You just have to kind of go in
slow.

00:52.998 --> 00:55.031
Andre, I'm waving my fingers
around to try to find any...

00:55.033 --> 00:57.200
Well, there is a
specific spot-- if you hit it,

00:57.202 --> 00:59.202
then you're good to go.
I don't want to look for a

00:59.204 --> 01:01.204
spot or a mechanism.
I miss the old days with the

01:01.206 --> 01:02.839
- knobs.
- You can't go in with

01:02.841 --> 01:05.375
both hands.
One and then add the second one

01:05.376 --> 01:08.544
if it all goes well.
I need to get both hands wet

01:08.546 --> 01:10.713
simultaneously.
Maybe get a...

01:10.715 --> 01:12.348
Spit on it a little bit...

01:12.350 --> 01:14.417
Why would I spit on my own
hand when the water's supposed

01:14.419 --> 01:16.419
- to come out?
- You know, you got to

01:16.421 --> 01:18.054
get things going a little bit
sometimes.

01:18.056 --> 01:20.056
You can't go in dry like
that-- you're gonna hurt your

01:20.058 --> 01:21.691
hands.
Let alone the sink.

01:21.693 --> 01:23.726
Sink's probably not so happy
about the whole thing.

01:23.728 --> 01:26.362
- Jenny, care to comment?
- I think it would be,

01:26.364 --> 01:28.998
maybe, nice for the sink for you
to ask the sink what the sink

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
wants.
What do I give a shit about

01:31.002 --> 01:33.503
the sink?
Yeah, that's my boy.

01:33.505 --> 01:35.772
Congrats, Jenny.
Well, I don't have that

01:35.774 --> 01:38.007
problem, boys.
'Cause I don't wash my hands in

01:38.009 --> 01:40.109
bathrooms.
'Cause the only thing I'm

01:40.111 --> 01:44.914
touching is me.
And you're a filth monster.

01:44.916 --> 01:48.584
What's up?
Oh, my God, Andre.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.687
What? I just came to talk to
my gander about a little trade

01:50.689 --> 01:52.755
action.
Did you come to talk to me

01:52.757 --> 01:55.525
about a trade or did you come
to, like, <i>talk</i> to me?

01:55.527 --> 01:57.927
Kind of want to do both,
'cause you're my she-bro, I'm

01:57.929 --> 01:59.929
your she-guy.
No. I will talk to you about

01:59.931 --> 02:01.931
a trade though.
Okay.

02:01.933 --> 02:05.368
Ray Rice for A.J. Green.
But I need to know soon.

02:05.370 --> 02:07.370
I want him this week.
I'm putting a clock on you.

02:07.372 --> 02:10.239
You'll have my answer soon.
Perhaps over dinner?

02:10.241 --> 02:12.742
We are not dating, Andre.
Coffee.

02:12.744 --> 02:14.377
No.
Think about it.

02:14.379 --> 02:18.281
I like a macchiato.
Oh, no, no. No, no, no!

02:18.283 --> 02:20.283
DeMarco Murray's out for the
rest of the game?

02:20.285 --> 02:22.285
I needed him!
I'm gonna lose now!

02:22.287 --> 02:25.221
To Chuck, no less.
Damn it, man, come on!

02:25.223 --> 02:27.724
Three running backs, four
fumbles, two points?

02:27.726 --> 02:30.059
It's you guys-- it's your fault.
I drafted you with high hopes

02:30.061 --> 02:32.061
and now none of you are living
up to your potential.

02:32.063 --> 02:33.663
Well, that's irony at its
finest.

02:33.665 --> 02:35.665
I draft Montee Ball.
Montee Ball's supposed to tear

02:35.667 --> 02:37.667
it up in Denver.
He shits the bed.

02:37.669 --> 02:39.769
So I pick up Knowshon Moreno--
something I said I would <i>never</i>

02:39.771 --> 02:42.405
<i>do again-- and then he screws</i>
<i>me.</i>

02:42.407 --> 02:45.241
<i>I haven't won in five seasons.</i>
<i>I've lost with better teams than</i>

02:45.243 --> 02:48.277
<i>this group of shitbags.</i>
<i>I can't rosterbate to you guys.</i>

02:48.279 --> 02:50.980
<i>I can't get a half-chub.</i>
<i>I can't even get a semi-chub!</i>

02:50.982 --> 02:55.785
<i>I'm walking away!</i>
<i>I'm done with fantasy football!</i>

02:55.787 --> 02:59.355
<i>But this is all he has.</i>
<i>You live here.</i>

02:59.357 --> 03:01.824
<i>I live here.</i>
<i>Not anymore.</i>

03:01.826 --> 03:03.926
<i>When you left just now, I moved</i>
<i>in.</i>

03:03.928 --> 03:06.329
<i>But you can totally crash here</i>
<i>if you want.</i>

03:06.331 --> 03:09.499
<i>Dr. Nowzick, are you sure</i>
<i>that surgery's the only option?</i>

03:09.501 --> 03:11.501
<i>You've done the toe exercises.</i>

03:11.503 --> 03:13.636
<i>They haven't worked.</i>
<i>You just got to face it.</i>

03:13.638 --> 03:16.439
<i>You are... toe-bese.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

03:16.441 --> 03:18.508
<i>I'm gonna take your Vienna</i>
<i>sausages, and I'm gonna turn 'em</i>

03:18.510 --> 03:20.510
<i>into Slim Jims.</i>
<i>The tits I did for my</i>

03:20.512 --> 03:22.512
<i>husband; the toes I'm doing for</i>
<i>me.</i>

03:22.514 --> 03:25.715
<i>- That's it. I want Giselle toes.</i>
<i>-  Okay, Carla,</i>

03:25.717 --> 03:27.683
<i>mark that down.</i>
<i>Giselle toes.</i>

03:27.685 --> 03:30.887
<i>Great.</i>
<i>Every day is gonna be a</i>

03:30.889 --> 03:34.390
<i>sandal day from here on out.</i>
<i>Hey, I just wanted to let you</i>

03:34.392 --> 03:37.493
<i>know that I've completed my</i>
<i>will, and I left some money for</i>

03:37.495 --> 03:39.495
<i>you.</i>
<i>Oh, of course.</i>

03:39.497 --> 03:41.998
<i>So I could move in here and take</i>
<i>care of the kids and  I</i>

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
<i>guess sleep with Jenny.</i>
<i>I don't have to give her</i>

03:44.002 --> 03:45.635
<i>orgasms, do I?</i>
<i>I don't have time for that.</i>

03:45.637 --> 03:47.336
<i>No, no, I don't want you to</i>
<i>do any of that stuff.</i>

03:47.338 --> 03:49.338
<i>Well, I sort of have to now.</i>
<i>It's in your will.</i>

03:49.340 --> 03:51.174
<i>It is not in my will.</i>
<i>You can't just change your</i>

03:51.176 --> 03:52.809
<i>will-- you have to have a lawyer</i>
<i>present.</i>

03:52.811 --> 03:54.811
<i>Do you know what I do?</i>
<i>I'm a lawyer.</i>

03:54.813 --> 03:56.412
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>That's-that's cute.</i>

03:56.414 --> 04:00.383
<i>I also want to inform you that</i>
<i>I've written a will as well, and</i>

04:00.385 --> 04:02.385
<i>I've left you a significant</i>
<i>amount of money.</i>

04:02.387 --> 04:04.821
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Yep. $1 million.</i>

04:04.823 --> 04:07.657
<i>Do you have a million dollars</i>
<i>to give away, Taco?</i>

04:07.659 --> 04:09.659
<i>Well, that depends on how</i>
<i>much you leave me.</i>

04:09.661 --> 04:11.661
<i>No, dingbat, you're not</i>
<i>understanding how this thing</i>

04:11.663 --> 04:13.262
<i>works.</i>
<i>You cannot give what you do not</i>

04:13.264 --> 04:15.264
<i>have.</i>
<i>"Where there's a will,</i>

04:15.266 --> 04:16.933
<i>there's a way."</i>
<i>That's a legal term.</i>

04:16.935 --> 04:20.202
<i>You should know that.</i>
<i>That...</i>

04:20.204 --> 04:23.172
<i>Hey, I need your help.</i>
<i>I'm being sued for malpractice.</i>

04:23.174 --> 04:25.341
<i>Did you leave a fedora in a</i>
<i>woman during surgery?</i>

04:25.343 --> 04:27.743
<i>No, that never happened.</i>
<i>It was a Livestrong bracelet.</i>

04:27.745 --> 04:29.745
<i>Now, look, it was a normal</i>
<i>toe-besity case.</i>

04:29.747 --> 04:31.414
<i>I did nothing wrong.</i>
<i>But now I have to be brought up</i>

04:31.416 --> 04:33.416
<i>in front of the hospital review</i>
<i>board.</i>

04:33.418 --> 04:35.051
<i>Are you hiring me as your</i>
<i>lawyer?</i>

04:35.053 --> 04:37.053
<i>Will you help me if I don't?</i>
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

04:37.055 --> 04:39.055
<i>Okay, then, fine.</i>
<i>You're hired.</i>

04:39.057 --> 04:41.624
<i>Okay. Now, tell Daddy exactly</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

04:41.626 --> 04:43.626
<i>It was a total routine</i>
<i>operation.</i>

04:43.628 --> 04:45.628
<i>I looked great in my</i>
<i>European-cut scrubs.</i>

04:45.630 --> 04:47.396
<i>I mean, they're so form-fitting.</i>
<i>Doctor.</i>

04:47.398 --> 04:49.398
<i>>></i> And my banter was off the
charts.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.400
And I know she's under
anesthetic 'cause she's not

04:51.402 --> 04:53.302
talking.

04:53.304 --> 04:57.073
I was on a ten-plus day.
Then I get a text from Jenny.

04:57.075 --> 04:59.075
She was gonna pull the trade if
I didn't make it right then and

04:59.077 --> 05:01.177
there.
So she put you on the clock.

05:01.179 --> 05:03.446
Exactly.
I'll be right back.

05:03.448 --> 05:06.616
What...

05:06.618 --> 05:09.619
Ahem.
Okay, well, this is great.

05:09.621 --> 05:12.555
I hope everything is going
excellently, um...

05:12.557 --> 05:14.957
Doctor, what are you doing?

05:14.959 --> 05:18.494
Uh, nothing. Never you mind.
Doctor, we have a surgery...

05:18.496 --> 05:22.131
Doctor stuff, okay? No, no.
Do...

05:22.133 --> 05:24.834
And you made the trade during
surgery?

05:24.836 --> 05:27.169
Now she's suing me because
she said that her toes are

05:27.171 --> 05:29.605
fatter.
All I know is that at the end of

05:29.607 --> 05:32.008
that operation, her toes were
skinny and I had Ray Rice.

05:32.010 --> 05:34.710
Case closed.
Look, Andre, Shark Ruxin is

05:34.712 --> 05:36.779
on the case.
Don't worry your shiny little

05:36.781 --> 05:38.547
vest about it.
You like it?

05:38.549 --> 05:40.549
Lawyer-client
confidentiality?

05:40.551 --> 05:42.351
Yes.
I despise it.

05:42.353 --> 05:45.888
I don't care. Thank you.

05:45.890 --> 05:47.890
Pete-Pete.
Hey, Jeremy.

05:47.892 --> 05:50.159
Got a big week seven coming
up-- I'm thinking about starting

05:50.161 --> 05:52.161
Torrey Smith...
You know, I normally give you

05:52.163 --> 05:54.964
fantasy advice, but, uh, I'm a
little busy right now.

05:54.966 --> 05:56.565
Sorry.
Totally respect that.

05:56.567 --> 05:59.869
T.Y. Hilton...
Okay, this is a workplace.

05:59.871 --> 06:02.371
This requires productivity, and
I don't have time to spend on

06:02.373 --> 06:04.373
fantasy football.
Got it. Yep.

06:04.375 --> 06:06.008
Good.
Don't turn around.

06:06.010 --> 06:08.144
I'm just gonna say a name.
You just say "yes" or "no."

06:08.146 --> 06:10.146
Yes.
Well, I have to say a name...

06:10.148 --> 06:11.981
Yes.
But, Pete, that's a...

06:11.983 --> 06:14.684
Yes.

06:14.686 --> 06:17.753
Hey, Mr. Haddock.
Hey, Pete, can I, uh, see you

06:17.755 --> 06:21.090
in my office, please?
Yeah, of course.

06:21.092 --> 06:24.593
Who am I looking at? Hmm?

06:24.595 --> 06:27.430
I don't recognize this Pete.
But I like him.

06:27.432 --> 06:29.432
You do?
Yeah, you've changed.

06:29.434 --> 06:31.667
Well, I got to say, Bill, I'm
really enjoying myself.

06:31.669 --> 06:33.903
And, uh, you know, I was even
thinking I could come in Sunday

06:33.905 --> 06:36.072
if you wanted some extra work.
I'm not doing anything.

06:36.074 --> 06:38.074
Well, I-I don't need your
help this Sunday, but I-I could

06:38.076 --> 06:39.709
use your help right now.
Sure.

06:39.711 --> 06:41.677
So, there is a project coming
up, but I've been having trouble

06:41.679 --> 06:43.713
lining up the right people.
You're trying to make a

06:43.715 --> 06:45.715
lineup.
Yeah, I guess so.

06:45.717 --> 06:47.616
Let me take a crack at that.
I have some experience with

06:47.618 --> 06:49.418
this.
Oh, yeah, yeah, great.

06:49.420 --> 06:51.420
This is my good pen.
I just need that back. Okay.

06:51.422 --> 06:53.422
Let's see...
Melanie calls in sick at least

06:53.424 --> 06:55.424
twice a month, so you definitely
don't want her on anything

06:55.426 --> 06:57.426
crucial.
I'd definitely keep her on the

06:57.428 --> 06:59.595
bench.
Um, Helen's normally a great

06:59.597 --> 07:01.697
choice.
Problem is, she's got a custody

07:01.699 --> 07:04.300
battle this week, so I'd say
she's questionable at best.

07:04.302 --> 07:06.936
There's Denise.
Obviously we're starting Denise

07:06.938 --> 07:08.571
no matter what.
Jeremy.

07:08.573 --> 07:10.573
Jeremy had a great performance
three weeks ago, but that's all

07:10.575 --> 07:12.575
he talks about, you know?
It's like, what have you done

07:12.577 --> 07:14.210
for me lately?
Yeah.

07:14.212 --> 07:16.645
Three weeks ago, I was
<i>killing</i> it.

07:16.647 --> 07:18.748
I was like, "Uh, give me my own
parking space already, all

07:18.750 --> 07:22.618
right?"
No. What about Bob?

07:22.620 --> 07:24.920
Bob's great with the legwork.
The problem is he has trouble

07:24.922 --> 07:27.757
closing.
Now, Henry? That guy can close.

07:27.759 --> 07:30.793
He is a deal vulture.
Start Henry, sit Bob.

07:30.795 --> 07:33.396
Yeah. Well, this is a great
lineup-- we should go with this.

07:33.398 --> 07:35.731
Yeah.
Although, you know, now that

07:35.733 --> 07:39.568
I'm looking at it, what if we
just move a few...

07:39.570 --> 07:41.637
Don't tinker.
Okay.

07:41.639 --> 07:43.639
Okay.
You're right.

07:43.641 --> 07:45.741
Oh, hey-o! There she is.
 I've heard of "pretty

07:45.743 --> 07:47.743
in pink" but "beautiful in
purple"?

07:47.745 --> 07:49.445
Come on.
What are you doing?

07:49.447 --> 07:51.514
Who is that?
That's the regional manager.

07:51.516 --> 07:53.282
She's the one we're playing for,
man.

07:53.284 --> 07:56.585
Shamara McCreedy
Sommers-Jefferson?

07:56.587 --> 08:00.756
Oh. Oh, I get it, yeah.

08:00.758 --> 08:02.691
Yeah.

08:05.316 --> 08:09.104
Hello?
Hello?

08:10.631 --> 08:14.266
G-God, Rafi, I thought you were

08:14.268 --> 08:17.068
in California!
I just got back!

08:17.188 --> 08:19.288
I came here to hang out with you
and you scare me like this?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.290
No, you don't come to my
house at night uninvited.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.892
Of course I do!
I do that all the time!

08:22.894 --> 08:24.560
You do not do that all the
time.

08:24.562 --> 08:26.562
I sit right here and I have
my dark thoughts.

08:26.564 --> 08:28.564
I don't want to hear that,
Rafi.

08:28.566 --> 08:30.700
And where is my car?!
Bad news on that.

08:30.702 --> 08:32.335
What?
I burned your car to the

08:32.337 --> 08:34.169
ground.
Why'd you do that?!

08:34.172 --> 08:36.172
If somebody said to you to
"take care of something," that

08:36.174 --> 08:38.174
means "light it on fire," right?
No.

08:38.176 --> 08:39.808
Well, then that's my bad on
that one.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.811
Great. Why are you here?
You and I have business

08:41.813 --> 08:43.813
together.
We don't have business

08:43.815 --> 08:45.414
together.
We have never had business

08:45.416 --> 08:47.416
together.
Ran into Taco when I got back

08:47.418 --> 08:49.418
to town.
He needed some money, so I

08:49.420 --> 08:51.721
floated him some cash.
He said he'd pay me back when

08:51.723 --> 08:55.191
you pay him.
I'm giving him money? When...

08:55.193 --> 08:57.860
Yeah. When you die.
This is the contract he and I

08:57.862 --> 08:59.862
drew up.
This is you, Brian, with X's

08:59.864 --> 09:01.864
over your eyes.
That means you're dead, like

09:01.866 --> 09:04.867
from the cartoons.
Equals money, okay?

09:04.869 --> 09:07.870
And that money was going to
Taco; now it's coming to me.

09:07.872 --> 09:10.873
This is not a legal document.
Oh, it's 100% legal.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.743
It's on legal paper, "A."
And, "B," Taco notarized it.

09:13.745 --> 09:16.379
Nailed it.
Okay, um, fine.

09:16.381 --> 09:19.515
I would be willing to buy Taco's
debt out.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.918
Come on. You can't game the
system like that, okay?

09:21.920 --> 09:25.688
In order for me to make this
money, you have to die.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.891
This was supposed to
be an investment for Taco.

09:28.893 --> 09:30.893
But now it's an investment
for me, see?

09:30.895 --> 09:33.362
I'm investing in your death.
Like I invest in stocks.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.364
You invest in stocks?
Oh, yeah, I've got tons of

09:35.366 --> 09:37.433
Apple stock.
You own Apple stock?

09:37.435 --> 09:40.403
Yeah. I also bought beef
stock, I bought chicken stock.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.705
And when the apocalypse happens,
guess who they're gonna have to

09:42.707 --> 09:45.374
come to for those sweet, sweet
little cubes.

09:45.376 --> 09:48.444
Rafi.
I'm gonna be a bullionaire.

09:48.446 --> 09:51.447
Okay, good night. Good night.
Hey, man, can you turn out

09:51.449 --> 09:53.616
the light when you leave?
I'm just gonna call a sex line

09:53.618 --> 09:58.754
quick.
Hello.

09:58.756 --> 10:00.823
Whoa!
Well, well, well, look at

10:00.825 --> 10:02.959
you.
Did you give a hand job to the

10:02.961 --> 10:05.261
Men's Wearhouse guy?
No, gentlemen, I'm wearing a

10:05.263 --> 10:08.564
suit because I got myself a
promotion.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.900
Not from cheating off of someone
else, not from sleeping with the

10:10.902 --> 10:13.069
boss's wife.
I got it based on my own work.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.071
It's hard to believe.
Seems suspect.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.473
Well, why is it suspect?
I've got all this free time on

10:17.475 --> 10:20.076
my hands now that I'm not doing
fantasy.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.445
I've gone from parking below
four to having my own parking

10:22.447 --> 10:24.280
spot.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:24.282 --> 10:26.282
Are you telling us you are
really done with fantasy

10:26.284 --> 10:28.117
football?
Why would I go back?

10:28.119 --> 10:30.152
Hello? What job is ever gonna
be as satisfying as winning the

10:30.154 --> 10:32.154
Shiva?
I mean, look at Andre right

10:32.156 --> 10:36.025
now-- he's about to lose his
just trying to win.

10:36.027 --> 10:38.260
I'm screwed.
The review board's this week.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.262
I'd dead in the water.
All right!

10:40.264 --> 10:42.098
What are we talking about?
Rafi, what are you doing

10:42.100 --> 10:44.100
here?
I've had such an annoying

10:44.102 --> 10:45.701
day.
What floor is Brian on?

10:45.703 --> 10:47.336
Why would Kevin be in this
building?

10:47.338 --> 10:49.338
Isn't this the lawyer building?

10:49.340 --> 10:51.340
Look, we have bigger fish to
fry, okay?

10:51.342 --> 10:53.042
Well, just tell me.
Who is on this review board?

10:53.044 --> 10:55.044
The head of the hospital.
And Shiva.

10:55.046 --> 10:57.046
I'm gonna look like an idiot in
front of her.

10:57.048 --> 10:58.681
You want me to take care of
this?

10:58.683 --> 11:00.683
I can take care of this Shiva
no problem.

11:00.685 --> 11:03.152
Boom, she's gone-zo.
No, R... We don't need you to

11:03.154 --> 11:05.321
kidnap Shiva.
I'm not in seventh grade.

11:05.323 --> 11:07.323
I don't kidnap people anymore.
So what does "take care of

11:07.325 --> 11:08.958
it" mean?
Douse her in kerosene and

11:08.960 --> 11:10.960
light her on fire.
Don't light anyone on fire.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.995
Why doesn't anybody get this?
We don't need you to kidnap

11:12.997 --> 11:14.630
her, we don't need you to light
her on fire.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.632
Nothing, okay?
All right, all right.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.300
I get it, guys.
Don't worry, "nothing's" gonna

11:18.302 --> 11:20.102
happen to her.
Wink.

11:20.104 --> 11:23.005
That's not a wink.
Yeah, it is. Wink.

11:23.007 --> 11:25.007
No, that's blinking.
Two eyes is blinking.

11:25.009 --> 11:27.710
Except I'm doing two one-eye
blinks at once.

11:27.712 --> 11:29.712
Wink.
So you got one and you got one.

11:29.714 --> 11:31.714
No, that's a blink.
Yeah, it's a blink.

11:31.716 --> 11:33.349
No, wink.
Blink.

11:33.351 --> 11:34.583
Blink.
Wink.

11:34.585 --> 11:36.218
Wink.
Then don't take care of it.

11:36.220 --> 11:38.387
Blink.
So I should take care of it?

11:38.389 --> 11:40.089
Wink.
Hey, listen, just 'cause we've

11:40.091 --> 11:42.324
said a lot of crazy stuff here,
all of this is protected under

11:42.326 --> 11:44.827
that lawyer-client
confidentiality thing?

11:44.829 --> 11:46.829
I'm not your lawyer, Rafi.
Doctor-patient

11:46.831 --> 11:48.831
confidentiality?
I'm not your doctor.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.933
Well, quick, give me a rectal
and let's figure this out.

11:50.935 --> 11:53.002
I don't do that.
Okay, fine!

11:53.004 --> 11:55.204
So now I'm at risk?
Got to destroy the evidence.

11:55.206 --> 11:57.239
Whoa, whoa!
 Hey, I'm taking this

11:57.241 --> 11:59.775
eagle.

11:59.777 --> 12:03.045
He went to medical school for
this?

12:03.047 --> 12:05.214
Oh! Oh!

12:05.216 --> 12:07.950
Oh, my God!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

12:07.952 --> 12:10.086
Rafi.
Brian?

12:10.088 --> 12:13.089
What are the chances?
You just tried to kill me,

12:13.091 --> 12:14.890
Rafi!
You almost just died.

12:14.892 --> 12:16.892
I know! You did it!
Oh, my God, you got to be

12:16.894 --> 12:18.360
careful.
All right, listen to me.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.529
I will pay you double the money
that you lent Taco.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.899
Deal.
But I want it all in change.

12:23.901 --> 12:26.202
'Cause the government can't
trace it, and it passes through

12:26.204 --> 12:29.472
the human colon intact.
I've got ten dollars of quarters

12:29.474 --> 12:31.974
in my belly right now.
It's my mad money.

12:31.976 --> 12:34.376
Fine, fine, okay.
This is over though?

12:34.378 --> 12:36.612
If you say so.
All right, I'll talk to you

12:36.614 --> 12:39.915
later, Brian.
What do we got here, huh?

12:39.917 --> 12:42.618
What is this, cinnamon?
Dick.

12:42.620 --> 12:47.323
I'm coming for you, hat!
Crazy.

12:47.325 --> 12:49.792
Pete the Treat.
What's up, Bill?

12:49.794 --> 12:51.794
We won again.
Yes, we did.

12:51.796 --> 12:54.430
That was a killer team.
I feel like Shamara-blasting.

12:54.432 --> 12:56.065
Shamara McCreedy
Sommers-Jefferson!

12:56.067 --> 12:58.167
All right, j-j... she's-she's
our boss.

12:58.169 --> 12:59.802
Exactly.
Yeah, yeah.

12:59.804 --> 13:01.904
What do you say we celebrate
with some of the good stuff?

13:01.906 --> 13:03.506
Chardonnay?

13:03.508 --> 13:05.508
That's right.
They don't call me the King of

13:05.510 --> 13:07.143
Chardonnay for nothing, my
friend.

13:07.145 --> 13:09.345
Doesn't get any better than this
C to the nay-nay.

13:09.347 --> 13:11.914
"C to the nay-nay"?
Who charded? I charded.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.150
Oh, I get it.
Anyway, hey, what do you say

13:14.152 --> 13:17.153
we call Steve, the manager of
the losing team, for a little

13:17.155 --> 13:19.155
trash talk?
Yes, now you're talking.

13:19.157 --> 13:20.790
Hello?

13:20.792 --> 13:22.858
Hey, Steve, it's, uh... it's
Bill and Pete, you know...

13:22.860 --> 13:24.860
What's up, Steve?
...the winners.

13:24.862 --> 13:26.529
That's right.
Hey, we wanted your address.

13:26.531 --> 13:28.164
We're gonna send you a care
package.

13:28.166 --> 13:30.166
Care package?
Care package for that

13:30.168 --> 13:32.201
shriveled-up little donger of
yours 'cause you're gonna be

13:32.203 --> 13:34.203
pulling on that pud within an
inch of its life tonight.

13:34.205 --> 13:36.205
Wt?
Steve, we'll call you back,

13:36.207 --> 13:38.007
buddy.
Okay, so... What are you doing?

13:38.009 --> 13:40.109
"Donger"?
It means "penis."

13:40.111 --> 13:42.344
You can't say that.
You could say "penis" if it's in

13:42.346 --> 13:44.713
a medical context.
I'm trash-talking here.

13:44.715 --> 13:47.149
What am I supposed to say?
Fun trash talk, you know?

13:47.151 --> 13:49.218
Like, "Hey, Steve, you know,
sorry you lost.

13:49.220 --> 13:51.954
Maybe you'll win next time, you
nut."

13:51.956 --> 13:53.956
That... is terrible.
You'll figure it out, all

13:53.958 --> 13:55.858
right?

13:55.860 --> 13:58.294
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Did you trade Jeremy to the

13:58.296 --> 14:00.496
Peoria office?
Yes, finally got rid of that

14:00.498 --> 14:02.698
guy.
We don't need him on our roster

14:02.700 --> 14:03.794
anymore.
His best days are behind him.

14:03.914 --> 14:05.150
We sold high.

14:09.091 --> 14:11.340
What are you doing?
He just bought a house here.

14:11.342 --> 14:13.742
I don't think...I guess I don't think
about what happens after they get cut.

14:13.744 --> 14:16.178
We'll-we'll talk about this
later.

14:16.180 --> 14:17.764
Jeremy? Jeremy!
Hey, kiddo.

14:17.987 --> 14:20.516
"C to the nay-nay"?

14:22.881 --> 14:25.048
Welcome to the review board,
gentlemen.

14:25.288 --> 14:27.722
Dr. Browner.
The other doctors here on the

14:27.724 --> 14:30.091
medical review board, thank you
for your time.

14:30.093 --> 14:32.293
You know, my client, Dr. Andre
Nowzick, stands before you

14:32.295 --> 14:34.729
today...
What are you doing?

14:34.731 --> 14:36.731
Standing.
Sit.

14:36.733 --> 14:39.500
Okay.
My client, Dr. Nowzick,

14:39.502 --> 14:42.103
stands before you here today...
Sit down.

14:42.105 --> 14:46.107
You just said, "Stand."
Yeah, metaphorically.

14:46.109 --> 14:48.509
Just sit.
My client, Dr. Andre Nowzick,

14:48.511 --> 14:50.912
sits quietly here before you
today...

14:50.914 --> 14:53.281
Gentlemen, as chief
administrator to the University

14:53.283 --> 14:58.753
Medical Center, I'm determined
to find out what happened during

14:58.755 --> 15:02.089
the elective surgery that you
performed on Mrs. Shapiro.

15:02.091 --> 15:05.693
A nurse claims that Dr. Nowzick
took his personal computer into

15:05.695 --> 15:11.532
the operating room.
Oh, my God, Andre.

15:11.534 --> 15:14.669
I know what this is.
No, <i>I</i> know what this is.

15:14.671 --> 15:18.773
Dr. Somakanakram, did you at any
point date my client?

15:18.775 --> 15:21.142
Yes.
Did my client, at any point,

15:21.144 --> 15:23.644
send you pictures of himself
dressed as Sexy Gollum holding

15:23.646 --> 15:26.047
on to his little precious?
A sadder "yes."

15:26.049 --> 15:28.716
Did he, at any point, write
erotic fan fiction about <i>Avatar</i>

15:28.718 --> 15:31.519
mixed with <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>
and titled it <i>Fifty Shades of</i>

15:31.521 --> 15:33.955
<i>Blue?</i>
<i>Okay, I object.</i>

15:33.957 --> 15:36.357
<i>I am not on trial here.</i>
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

15:36.359 --> 15:38.793
<i>You are, actually.</i>
<i>Okay, well, my writing</i> is not

15:38.795 --> 15:41.729
on trial here.
Perhaps it should be.

15:41.731 --> 15:46.834
Hello, my friend.
Oh.

15:46.836 --> 15:49.303
What's up?
Rafi, why are you dressed

15:49.305 --> 15:51.238
like a janitor?
Ah, don't worry about it.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.040
Is that the stuff?
Yeah. Here.

15:53.042 --> 15:55.042
Ooh, yeah, come to Daddy.
Got it?

15:55.044 --> 15:56.811
Ooh.
Great. Are we done?

15:56.813 --> 15:58.646
Deal.
Great.

15:58.648 --> 16:00.481
Oh, my God. What...?
Oh, sorry about that.

16:00.483 --> 16:02.350
Oh, my...
Yeah, no...

16:02.352 --> 16:04.151
Oh, my God!
I was just in the morgue.

16:04.153 --> 16:05.920
What?!
You know when people die,

16:05.922 --> 16:08.389
they void everything.
Wait, wait, what is this?

16:08.391 --> 16:10.658
Oh, it's everything.
Oh, God, I got to get this

16:10.660 --> 16:12.393
off my hands!
Yeah. Good luck, buddy.

16:12.395 --> 16:15.363
I got to find a bathroom.
Here's my question to you,

16:15.365 --> 16:17.865
the board.
What would drive a woman like

16:17.867 --> 16:20.401
this to date a man who dresses
like an Armenian immigrant who's

16:20.403 --> 16:23.938
fallen into some money because
someone was killed at the cell

16:23.940 --> 16:26.340
phone store where his brother
works?

16:26.342 --> 16:28.576
How can you trust the judgment
of a woman like this, who could

16:28.578 --> 16:33.714
be so impaired as to allow a man
like this to put his bizarre

16:33.716 --> 16:36.217
little dingus inside of her?
Sit down!

16:36.219 --> 16:38.619
We are not going to go anywhere
until we find out what

16:38.621 --> 16:41.022
transpired.
That's exactly what she said

16:41.024 --> 16:43.424
every time they had sex.
But that's not why we're here.

16:43.426 --> 16:45.860
My client stands before you
today a...

16:45.862 --> 16:48.229
Sit down, Andre!
He... That is confusing!

16:48.231 --> 16:50.631
He told you to sit, you sat.
You tell me to stand, I have to

16:50.633 --> 16:53.034
sit?
Sit down.

16:53.036 --> 16:55.403
Okay, fine.
Down.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.605
It's really not hard to
understand at all.

16:57.607 --> 16:59.807
Oh, excuse me, it's janitor
time.

16:59.809 --> 17:02.209
I make clean now?
That's-that's fine.

17:02.211 --> 17:05.378
Uh...
Okay, thank you.

17:05.381 --> 17:07.815
Oh, thank you so much.
Guys, it's me.

17:07.817 --> 17:10.217
Rafi.
We know.

17:10.219 --> 17:12.420
Of course.
I'm here to save the day.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.422
What is that?
No!

17:14.424 --> 17:16.123
What...
This bitch here...

17:16.125 --> 17:17.791
No. No.

17:17.794 --> 17:20.294
No, Rafi, you don't need to.
I do this trash near pretty

17:20.296 --> 17:22.563
lady doctor now.
No, that's fine.

17:22.565 --> 17:24.732
He can clean where he wants
to, okay, guys?

17:24.733 --> 17:26.767
Yes, oh, thank you, pretty
doctor lady.

17:26.769 --> 17:28.736
You do not want him cleaning
anything.

17:28.738 --> 17:31.906
I clean table. I clean mouth.
You breathe deep.

17:31.908 --> 17:34.275
No, no!
No, no, no, no.

17:34.277 --> 17:36.444
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my God, Andre!

17:36.446 --> 17:38.179
You breathe deep.
What are you doing?

17:38.181 --> 17:40.514
No, no, no! I must flee!
Enough!

17:40.516 --> 17:42.516
You had my vote, now you don't.

17:42.518 --> 17:45.152
Mrs. Shapiro's going to be
here momentarily to show us the

17:45.154 --> 17:47.688
damage to her foot, and then
this session will be over.

17:47.690 --> 17:49.490
Well, what do we do now?
We'll just sit down.

17:49.492 --> 17:51.492
Oh, really?
Just sit, or should we stand?

17:51.494 --> 17:53.928
Yes, sit down, Andre!
You admit it's confusing,

17:53.930 --> 17:57.231
then.
Oh, God.

17:57.233 --> 18:04.705
Oh, come on!
Not again!

18:04.707 --> 18:07.108
Please, just give me some...

18:07.110 --> 18:11.278
All right, baby, I'm gonna turn

18:11.280 --> 18:15.316
you on now, okay?
Yeah.

18:15.318 --> 18:18.319
Yeah, where's your spot, huh?
They say you got a spot.

18:18.321 --> 18:20.721
Where is it?
Come on, give it to me, come on,

18:20.723 --> 18:23.124
come on.
La, la, la, la.

18:23.126 --> 18:25.793
Where is it?

18:25.795 --> 18:29.296
Let it out. Let it out.

18:29.298 --> 18:37.805
My name is Rodney Ruxin.
God, it's disgusting! Ugh!

18:37.807 --> 18:40.141
Hey, Brian! Brian!
Brian!

18:40.143 --> 18:41.876
Hey!
No, no, no, no, no, Rafi.

18:41.878 --> 18:43.577
I paid you your money.
This is over.

18:43.579 --> 18:45.713
I don't want to hear about it.
Taco gave me the money that

18:45.715 --> 18:47.648
he owed me.
Plus interest, I might add.

18:47.650 --> 18:49.316
Yeah.
So I can give you this back

18:49.318 --> 18:50.818
now.
What? How did you get this

18:50.820 --> 18:52.686
kind of money?
He said he stole a bunch of

18:52.688 --> 18:55.055
crap from some douche named
Kevin's house and sold it on the

18:55.057 --> 18:56.524
street.
Yeah.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.392
Oh, God, you know what?
You're out of the will, Taco.

18:58.394 --> 18:59.693
You're done.
Hey, buddy.

18:59.695 --> 19:01.228
What?
Don't leave me hanging.

19:01.230 --> 19:02.863
Oh. Yeah.
When we get in front of the

19:02.865 --> 19:05.533
review board, I want them to
understand that I have stretch

19:05.535 --> 19:08.502
marks on my toes.
It's like I'm walking around on

19:08.504 --> 19:10.204
ten used condoms.
You know what, just give me

19:10.206 --> 19:11.939
back the money, please.
Here you go.

19:11.941 --> 19:14.408
No, d-don't throw it, Rafi.
Don't... Oh, God!

19:14.410 --> 19:17.578
My toes!

19:17.580 --> 19:21.048
Soap on my hands!

19:21.050 --> 19:22.583
Oh.
Oh, my gosh.

19:22.585 --> 19:25.019
Ow, my toe...
Okay, going away.

19:25.021 --> 19:27.188
That's a dead end!

19:27.190 --> 19:29.123
That's a dead end!

19:29.125 --> 19:36.597
Oh, dear.
The-the hospital has bigger foot

19:36.599 --> 19:39.033
issues to deal with right now.
Come on.

19:39.035 --> 19:43.270
This case is closed.
What happened?

19:43.272 --> 19:45.706
I came through again.
You two are the luckiest

19:45.708 --> 19:48.108
assholes in the whole world.

19:48.110 --> 19:49.743
Shiva Komedi...

19:49.745 --> 19:52.913
Somakanakram!
Yeah.

19:52.915 --> 19:55.115
I'm so sorry about that.
I'm not.

19:55.117 --> 19:57.284
Ow, my toes!
All right.

19:57.286 --> 19:58.986
My toes, my toes.
Just breathe.

19:58.988 --> 20:00.888
Will I ever wear sandals

20:00.890 --> 20:02.556
again?
Ooh. Aah.

20:02.558 --> 20:07.305
Ow! They will pay for these
toes! I want new toes!

20:09.715 --> 20:11.711
Hospital totally dropped the
charges against me.

20:11.951 --> 20:13.846
Now Mrs. Shapiro is suing the
hospital.

20:13.966 --> 20:16.320
I'm out, scot-free.
I'm happy that you're

20:16.322 --> 20:17.802
exonerated.
I'm so happy, I don't even

20:17.828 --> 20:19.462
care that Pete beat me this
week.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.827
Yeah, poor son of a bitch is
at work, he doesn't even know...

20:21.829 --> 20:25.716
That he's won?!
Oh, yes, he is well aware.

20:25.836 --> 20:28.856
I've got the week-long fantasy
juggernaut just waiting to

20:28.976 --> 20:30.269
explode.

20:30.408 --> 20:32.201
Oh, and in your face.

20:32.321 --> 20:34.058
Some for you, Kevin.
But don't worry, gents.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.868
There's plenty of Pete's fizzy
jizzy to go around.

20:36.870 --> 20:39.670
That's right, boys. I'm back.
Is there enough fizzy jizz to

20:39.672 --> 20:40.831
go around?

20:41.066 --> 20:51.139
