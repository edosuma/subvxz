Woman: <i>"Previously on Stitchers..."</i>

00:05.511 --> 00:08.704
You will look back and know that you
were part of something very important.

00:08.729 --> 00:10.509
You didn't warn me people could get hurt.

00:10.534 --> 00:12.702
- It was a suicide.
- I think you're wrong.

00:12.727 --> 00:16.290
This is a picture of Ed and my mother.
Who's been ripped out of the photo?

00:16.315 --> 00:19.196
Man: Impersonating a police
officer. Are you insane?

00:19.222 --> 00:20.931
He's innocent. I feel it.

00:20.956 --> 00:23.048
That's what I'm worried about.

00:23.073 --> 00:25.462
Stitching affects you, makes
you different for a little bit.

00:25.487 --> 00:28.629
It doesn't always last, but
sometimes people get hurt.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.689
Kirsten: What's going on with you two?

00:31.650 --> 00:34.285
Going on? Nothing.

00:34.310 --> 00:36.056
Is this what love is?

00:36.081 --> 00:40.685
Intense connection and then
heartbreaking loss? Is it worth it?

00:41.483 --> 00:43.954
I don't know. If you
figure it out, tell me.

00:47.152 --> 00:48.987
<i>(Machines beeping)</i>

00:49.021 --> 00:51.839
She's seizing. Cardiac arrest!

00:51.864 --> 00:54.204
- (Shouting)
- (Gagging)

00:55.610 --> 00:58.478
- Vitals?
- Cerebral temp is 104.

00:58.503 --> 01:01.814
- Heart rate 155 and climbing.
- Bounce her out of there.

01:01.839 --> 01:03.873
Woman: Somebody, get over here now!

01:03.898 --> 01:05.283
<i>(Beeping continuing)</i>

01:05.308 --> 01:08.924
Marta, talk to me. Your exit pin code.

01:08.948 --> 01:10.720
Man: I need assistance, stat!

01:10.745 --> 01:13.376
- Marta!
- Memory collapse, ten seconds.

01:13.401 --> 01:15.202
- Marta, make the bounce!
- She's tachycarding.

01:15.705 --> 01:18.978
- Bounce her out of there.
- I can't without a stable bio-com connection.

01:20.312 --> 01:22.620
I can't get a clear line.

01:23.911 --> 01:26.579
- Five seconds!
- We don't have the time.

01:26.604 --> 01:28.673
If I rip her out now, her mind could fry.

01:28.698 --> 01:30.197
If you don't, she's gonna die.

01:30.222 --> 01:33.096
(Gagging)

01:33.121 --> 01:34.611
We're losing her.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.619
Bounce her of there, Cameron, now!

01:44.770 --> 01:47.164
(Cell phone beeping)

01:58.860 --> 02:03.405
- (Cell phone rings)
- What?

02:03.430 --> 02:07.132
That's how you answer the
phone? Where's my cheery hello?

02:08.419 --> 02:11.255
- I don't do cheery.
- You know, smiling more often

02:11.280 --> 02:15.089
can relieve stress, lower blood
pressure and boost immune system.

02:15.114 --> 02:17.554
- <i>You should try it sometime.</i>
- Why are you calling me

02:17.579 --> 02:20.304
instead of talking to me
here in person at the lab?

02:20.329 --> 02:22.335
Wow. You are so not a morning person.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.595
I'm not an anytime person.

02:24.620 --> 02:27.436
- Time of day doesn't...
- Matter to you. Right.

02:27.461 --> 02:31.229
If you're gonna make me do a physical,
you could at least be here yourself

02:31.254 --> 02:33.280
- <i>on time.</i>
- I hit snooze a few times too many.

02:33.305 --> 02:36.969
I didn't sleep well last
night. So what did Ayo tell you?

02:37.002 --> 02:40.734
How's your blood pressure? EKG? Any
side effects from being stitched?

02:40.758 --> 02:42.732
Fever? Vertigo?

02:43.257 --> 02:46.413
Actually, I do have

02:46.438 --> 02:48.740
a giant pain in my ass.

02:48.765 --> 02:50.633
Go ahead. Mock my concern.

02:50.658 --> 02:53.232
<i>There's no reason to
be concerned. I'm fine.</i>

02:53.260 --> 02:56.355
- Damn.
- You don't want me to be fine?

02:56.380 --> 02:59.613
No, I want my neighbor to
stop stealing my magazines.

02:59.638 --> 03:03.024
- <i> What?</i>
- I moved from the loft below mine a couple of months ago.

03:03.049 --> 03:05.022
Now the guy in there refuses to
put his name on the mailbox,

03:05.047 --> 03:06.429
so he keeps getting my magazines.

03:06.454 --> 03:10.820
And now you are mourning
the loss of <i>Popular Geek</i> ?

03:10.844 --> 03:13.288
No. <i>Molecular Gastronomy.</i>

03:13.313 --> 03:15.214
I like to stay current, but he hoards them.

03:15.239 --> 03:17.389
- So man up and go get them.
- You don't understand.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.682
- This guy is...
- Large?

03:19.707 --> 03:22.088
- Odd.
- You should get along just fine then.

03:22.113 --> 03:25.607
Funny. Okay, fine, I'll go.

03:25.632 --> 03:29.069
But if you don't hear from me in an
hour, look for my head in his freezer.

03:29.094 --> 03:31.062
(Beeps)

03:45.599 --> 03:48.186
Robbie.

03:49.028 --> 03:50.587
Hey, it's Cameron.

03:50.612 --> 03:52.579
From upstairs.

03:53.799 --> 03:55.623
Hello.

04:03.418 --> 04:05.732
Love what you've done with the place.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.710
I knew it.

04:13.492 --> 04:15.086
God damn...

04:15.111 --> 04:18.195
Robbie, you know, hey, it's bad
enough that you steal my magazines.

04:18.233 --> 04:20.733
You don't gotta dog-ear the pages, too.

04:20.759 --> 04:22.533
(Sighs)

04:22.558 --> 04:25.260
You know, why don't you
consider your own subscription...

04:27.534 --> 04:29.434

04:59.720 --> 05:02.105
- Poor guy.
- Was he a friend?

05:02.130 --> 05:06.300
Yeah, we passed each other in the building a
few times, but he wasn't big on small talk.

05:06.325 --> 05:08.393
Or housekeeping.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.816
So was this a robbery?

05:10.841 --> 05:13.476
I doubt it. Valuables and
artwork are still here.

05:13.501 --> 05:15.732
If you wanna call this art.

05:18.663 --> 05:20.068
It's a Ginsberg.

05:20.093 --> 05:22.707
Well, Mrs. Ginsberg must
be very proud of her son.

05:23.026 --> 05:25.379
Well. Looks like an execution.

05:25.754 --> 05:27.675
Two shots in the back at close range.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.702
Like a hit by the mob?

05:30.971 --> 05:33.139
Easy there, Don Corleone.

05:33.164 --> 05:34.730
What do you know about this guy?

05:34.755 --> 05:39.231
Not much. He was a paralegal,
I think, at a firm downtown.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.816
Who liked to steal your magazines.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.347
At least you don't have to
worry about that anymore.

05:42.372 --> 05:44.425
Okay, the man is dead.
That's your silver lining?

05:44.450 --> 05:45.995
Whoa, what does she mean, he stole?

05:46.020 --> 05:48.678
I used to live here. He never
took my name off his mailbox,

05:48.703 --> 05:49.766
so our mail gets mixed up.

05:53.112 --> 05:55.466
What's with the looks?

05:57.064 --> 05:58.991
Maybe you were the target.

05:59.016 --> 06:00.183
Huh?

06:00.208 --> 06:01.790
Fisher: It's possible.

06:01.815 --> 06:03.891
The victim's about the same age and build.

06:03.916 --> 06:06.651
In the dark, someone could
easily have mistaken him for you.

06:06.676 --> 06:09.290
But why would anyone want to kill me?

06:09.393 --> 06:13.491
You're a neuroscientist that works for
a secret government agency on technology

06:13.516 --> 06:15.014
that could change the world as we know it.

06:15.163 --> 06:17.702
- There is that.
- It's just a theory.

06:17.727 --> 06:19.461
Okay, well, let's go
with a different theory.

06:19.486 --> 06:21.587
The one where my neighbor had
enemies who wanted him dead.

06:21.612 --> 06:23.579
We can't rule anything out.

06:25.637 --> 06:27.805
Actually, I can.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.499
What if that was meant to be me?

06:36.524 --> 06:38.325
Don't jump to conclusions.

06:38.350 --> 06:40.899
Fisher is interviewing his
colleagues, friends, and family.

06:40.924 --> 06:42.272
And?

06:42.297 --> 06:45.592
Well, so far his colleagues
didn't know him very well.

06:45.617 --> 06:46.811
No family to speak of.

06:46.836 --> 06:49.491
And his friends, well, there aren't many.

06:49.516 --> 06:52.279
So he's a loner. There's
no motive to kill him.

06:52.304 --> 06:53.868
Whereas with me...

06:54.835 --> 06:57.769
Does anyone outside of the program
know the nature of your work here?

06:57.794 --> 07:00.169
Not that I'm aware of.

07:00.194 --> 07:02.568
But what about inside the program?

07:03.428 --> 07:05.868
Tim from engineering never liked me.

07:09.708 --> 07:13.669
The more probable scenario is Mr.
Peterson was involved with some bad people.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.469
It seems like he hardly left his apartment.

07:15.494 --> 07:17.991
Well, you never know what
goes on behind closed doors.

07:18.541 --> 07:22.591
I do. At least I will when
you stitch me in. Ready?

07:28.162 --> 07:29.735
Hey, there.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.728
Whatever.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.958
Whatever?

07:34.561 --> 07:37.131
I called. I texted. Got nothing.

07:37.564 --> 07:40.139
Oh, you think I've been dodging you?

07:40.164 --> 07:43.499
Well, FYI, unlike Kirsten I
did not take a leave of absence

07:43.524 --> 07:45.498
from the university to be a stitcher.

07:45.811 --> 07:50.124
I had an optogenetics presentation. I
put myself on total lockdown to prepare.

07:50.218 --> 07:52.655
You're going with the optogenetics story?

07:52.680 --> 07:54.681
You know, "needy lover"

07:54.706 --> 07:57.855
never looks good on anyone.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.131
We hooked up, followed by radio silence.

08:01.156 --> 08:03.131
I took it as a comment on my performance.

08:03.156 --> 08:05.830
I didn't realize you
were waiting for a review.

08:07.005 --> 08:10.475
- I thought we had a good time.
- No, we had a great time.

08:10.628 --> 08:14.269
We did? I mean, yeah,
we did. Of course we did.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.550
- Wanna grab dinner tonight?
- I don't think so.

08:16.575 --> 08:18.308
I thought we had a good time.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.925
Absolutely. Emphasis on "had."

08:21.813 --> 08:23.814
Linus, how's it looking?

08:23.839 --> 08:25.595
Like a crash and burn.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.107
Come again?

08:30.586 --> 08:32.988
Bio-com signal is coming
in steady and strong.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.785
Double-check please.

08:35.196 --> 08:36.730
As I said, we're good to go.

08:36.755 --> 08:39.620
- Blood pressure?
- 117 over 76.

08:39.645 --> 08:42.111
- That's up from a minute ago.
- Because you're bugging me.

08:42.138 --> 08:43.296
Check her temp.

08:45.126 --> 08:46.826
(Beeps)

08:46.851 --> 08:48.425
Still 98.6.

08:48.450 --> 08:50.384
- Please, can we do this?
- Fine.

08:50.409 --> 08:53.756
But when you're in the stitch,
if you feel anything unusual...

08:53.781 --> 08:55.472
I'll be sure to let you know.

08:55.497 --> 08:58.972
Stations, please. Lights at 20% please.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.503
I need a go, no-go for
stitch neurosync. Life-sci.

09:01.528 --> 09:02.409
We are a go.

09:02.434 --> 09:03.737
- Sub-bio?
- Go.

09:03.763 --> 09:05.631
- Engineering?
- Go, go.

09:05.656 --> 09:07.836
- Communications?
- Yeah, go.

09:07.861 --> 09:09.495
- Medical?
- Go.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.542
- Cameron: Comm check. One, two.
- Kirsten: I hear you.

09:11.567 --> 09:13.526
Are you sure? Because we
can boost the reception if...

09:13.552 --> 09:15.441
I said I can hear you. Not sure I want to.

09:15.466 --> 09:18.738
Fine. Initiate stitch neurosync on my mark.

09:18.763 --> 09:22.437
In three, two, one...

09:23.200 --> 09:25.134
Mark!

09:27.358 --> 09:30.237
(Sighs) I'm in.

09:35.969 --> 09:37.770
He's reading a magazine.

09:37.795 --> 09:40.542
Of course he is. One of mine?

09:42.145 --> 09:46.323
- Do you subscribe to <i>Chart & Scope?</i>
- No.

09:46.348 --> 09:48.846
Looks like our Mr.
Peterson was into astronomy.

09:48.872 --> 09:50.581
Is this close to the time he was shot?

09:50.606 --> 09:52.151
Cameron: No.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.409
I wanted to ease you
into his final moments.

09:54.434 --> 09:56.784
- Why?
- He was shot twice in the back.

09:56.809 --> 09:58.883
That could be very traumatic for you.

09:58.915 --> 10:01.988
I'm a rip-the-band-aid-off fast
kind of girl. I can handle it.

10:02.013 --> 10:05.086
You need time to adjust.

10:05.111 --> 10:07.187
You do, I don't.

10:07.212 --> 10:08.279
Is everything okay?

10:08.420 --> 10:10.058
Kirsten's just being very difficult...

10:10.083 --> 10:11.900
No, I mean with you.

10:11.925 --> 10:14.072
Let her do her job.

10:16.471 --> 10:19.302
Fine. Brace yourself.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.302
I'm shifting you as close as I
can to the time of his murder.

10:27.441 --> 10:29.564

10:35.386 --> 10:37.253

10:39.506 --> 10:40.819
Cameron: <i>What do you see?</i>

10:40.844 --> 10:42.019
He's at the window.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.884
(Helicopter whirring)

10:47.035 --> 10:49.219
A police helicopter's overhead.

10:49.244 --> 10:51.618
It's downtown L.A., that happens.

10:53.675 --> 10:55.742
- (Door opens)
- Someone's here.

10:55.767 --> 10:59.250
- (Gasps)
- Kirsten, what happened?

10:59.471 --> 11:02.188
He was shot in the back.
He couldn't see who did it.

11:02.213 --> 11:03.993
Well, did you hear the
shooter say anything?

11:04.018 --> 11:05.923
Like "these bullets are
meant for you, Cameron."

11:07.367 --> 11:08.500
It could have happened.

11:08.525 --> 11:10.836
I can't tell if it was
meant for him or for you.

11:10.861 --> 11:12.395
Awesome.

11:14.259 --> 11:16.293
There's a telescope here.

11:16.836 --> 11:18.361
It's glowing.

11:18.639 --> 11:21.282
People, we have a glowing telescope.

11:21.307 --> 11:24.051
Looks like a memory hot spot.
Something of special significance.

11:24.076 --> 11:25.835
Okay, Gonzo. Check it out.

12:01.559 --> 12:03.693
Ok, Robbie wasn't stargazing.

12:03.718 --> 12:05.812
He was spying on his neighbors.

12:05.837 --> 12:08.672
A peeping Tom? What did he see?

12:08.697 --> 12:10.865
Maybe something that he shouldn't have.

12:10.890 --> 12:13.812
Something that got him killed.

12:17.725 --> 12:22.007
- So our victim was a voyeur.
- Fancy word for pervert.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.000
We're not here to judge.
We're here to solve a murder.

12:24.025 --> 12:25.515
At least it wasn't meant to be yours, bro.

12:25.540 --> 12:26.992
We still don't know that for sure, bro.

12:27.017 --> 12:29.711
- Did you see anyone suspicious?
- Not overtly.

12:29.736 --> 12:31.970
Besides the usual peeping Tom stuff.

12:31.995 --> 12:35.232
Details, please. What?

12:35.257 --> 12:39.093
There were a few things in particular
I felt Robbie emotionally drawn to.

12:39.127 --> 12:41.929
A jogger, someone painting
someone's fingernails,

12:41.964 --> 12:44.929
and a girl in a tank top
going to her refrigerator.

12:44.954 --> 12:49.234
Details, please. What?

12:49.259 --> 12:52.844
Also a guy that looked like he had
a knife, yelling at his girlfriend.

12:52.869 --> 12:56.738
Maybe one of them caught Robbie
spying on them and killed him.

12:57.791 --> 13:00.660
I think tank top girl
clocked Robbie looking at her.

13:00.685 --> 13:02.922
If she did, why kill him
and not just report him?

13:02.947 --> 13:06.683
At this stage, those apartments
are our only leads. Linus.

13:08.076 --> 13:10.077
Can you identify the apartments?

13:10.292 --> 13:13.461
It's hard to say. All the
windows look very similar.

13:13.486 --> 13:16.016
What if you looked from the
windows at Robbie's place?

13:16.040 --> 13:17.265
Maybe one would look familiar.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.171
His apartment is an active crime scene.

13:19.197 --> 13:22.572
Fisher is gonna have trouble
justifying our presence there.

13:24.605 --> 13:28.000
- What about Cameron's?
- What about Cameron's?

13:28.239 --> 13:31.814
Well, your place is right above his.
It has practically the same view.

13:31.839 --> 13:33.913
That is worth a shot. Cameron?

13:34.219 --> 13:37.288
<i>Mi casa es su casa?</i>

13:40.580 --> 13:43.171
I like the vibe in here. Geek chic.

13:43.196 --> 13:44.859
I really could see myself living here.

13:44.884 --> 13:46.390
Yep, I can't.

13:46.415 --> 13:49.272
All right, put something under those
legs. I just had the floors redone.

13:49.297 --> 13:51.187
Maggie really came through with the gear.

13:51.212 --> 13:53.886
What's the point of having an
unlimited budget if we don't use it?

13:54.698 --> 13:56.492
Where do you want me to stick this?

13:57.657 --> 13:59.592
Never mind.

14:00.091 --> 14:04.392
Okay, were you raised in a barn?
Get that... careful with my stuff!

14:04.758 --> 14:06.993
- I'm starving.
- This isn't a party.

14:07.018 --> 14:10.390
Look, I know you're still on edge
over the whole "don't shoot me" thing,

14:10.415 --> 14:13.196
but you really need to
chill. And get me a snack.

14:13.221 --> 14:14.789
He's been acting strange all day.

14:14.823 --> 14:16.476
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

14:16.501 --> 14:20.676
Yeah, seriously, lighten up. You're being
so anal, you're giving colons a bad name.

14:20.936 --> 14:25.475
My friends, we are live.

14:26.179 --> 14:29.376
It is a good day to spy.

14:37.797 --> 14:43.207
So the guy in 5A is dressing his cats up

14:43.232 --> 14:44.532
in little outfits.

14:44.557 --> 14:47.425
Some people like to dress up their pets.

14:47.609 --> 14:49.269
As ballerinas?

14:50.201 --> 14:51.935
(Mutters)

14:51.960 --> 14:55.749
The girl in 6C is tipping
the pizza delivery guy,

14:55.774 --> 14:57.249
and she...

14:57.460 --> 15:00.296
Holy... pepperoni.

15:00.321 --> 15:03.148
Okay, this is an invasion of privacy.

15:03.173 --> 15:04.646
- We have to do this.
- Yeah, I know.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.130
But people have a right to their secrets.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.930
Not if those secrets
are hurting other people.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.594
Don't pout, pumpkin.

15:17.619 --> 15:19.182
I don't want you mad at me.

15:20.492 --> 15:24.309
I'm just a little confused
as to why you don't want to...

15:24.310 --> 15:25.811
Repeat performance?

15:27.997 --> 15:31.193
Well, listen, Maestro, I mean, it's simple.

15:31.218 --> 15:35.616
We shared a lovely, spontaneous,

15:35.641 --> 15:37.442
in the moment experience.

15:37.468 --> 15:39.641
- You forgot hot.
- That, too.

15:39.877 --> 15:41.812
And now it's history.

15:42.384 --> 15:44.141
History can repeat itself.

15:44.166 --> 15:47.441
No, history should stay in the past.

15:47.466 --> 15:49.542
You can't go home again.

15:50.863 --> 15:53.632
What about third base?

15:57.691 --> 15:59.474
(Door opens)

16:01.738 --> 16:05.411
Look at this. You guys are
nothing if not well funded.

16:05.436 --> 16:07.911
Hey, Fisher. Did you crack the case yet?

16:07.936 --> 16:10.098
As of now, still no motive for the killing.

16:10.123 --> 16:11.865
The victim led a simple life.

16:11.890 --> 16:14.665
Worked 9:00 to 5:00 and
spent his off-hours at home.

16:14.690 --> 16:17.066
Any progress here?

16:17.394 --> 16:19.068
I've ruled out some windows,

16:19.093 --> 16:21.366
but there are plenty still
with their curtains closed.

16:22.137 --> 16:24.818
So no sign of tank top girl or knife guy.

16:24.843 --> 16:26.536
How long are you prepared to keep this up?

16:26.561 --> 16:29.333
- As long as it takes.
- She's addicted.

16:29.358 --> 16:32.432
I can stop anytime. I choose not to.

16:34.585 --> 16:36.632
Kirsten, I have to tell you something.

16:36.657 --> 16:38.432
It's about Ed Clark.

16:40.918 --> 16:45.193
After an extensive investigation,
we found no evidence of foul play.

16:45.218 --> 16:48.682
LAPD is officially ruling
his death as a suicide.

16:49.931 --> 16:51.598
So that's it?

16:51.623 --> 16:54.885
- You've closed the case.
- Yeah.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.893
I'm looking forward to
the day I prove you wrong.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.819
Me, too.

17:02.335 --> 17:04.659
Doughnut?

17:06.221 --> 17:09.175
Contrary to popular belief,
all cops don't love doughnuts.

17:09.906 --> 17:12.476
- Suit yourself.
- Hold it.

17:12.501 --> 17:16.366
- Is that a chocolate glazed?
- Check it. Fisher likes sprinkles.

17:16.705 --> 17:18.440
Don't judge me.

17:19.801 --> 17:21.469
I got him.

17:27.472 --> 17:29.102
Is that who you saw in stitch?

17:32.333 --> 17:35.633
Yeah, he was arguing with
her when Robbie saw them.

17:35.658 --> 17:37.331
Looks like they still are.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.118
What a douche.

17:45.762 --> 17:47.462
Kirsten: Knife.

17:47.495 --> 17:50.463
- Which apartment is that?
- 7C.

17:50.555 --> 17:52.689
Requesting back-up,

17:52.714 --> 17:56.425
apartment 7C, 652 South
Broadway, domestic disturbance.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.863
- Suspect with a knife.
- Yo, this isn't good.

18:06.416 --> 18:08.695
Come on, Fisher!

18:10.714 --> 18:13.066
- (Gasps)
- We're too late.

18:13.091 --> 18:15.266
He killed her.

18:28.492 --> 18:30.159
Son of a bitch!

18:30.184 --> 18:32.231
Come on, Fisher, get in there.

18:34.677 --> 18:37.031
Finally. Get that bastard.

18:37.056 --> 18:39.057
(Sirens wailing)

18:40.881 --> 18:43.930
Oh, my God, the girl.
Fisher, find the girl.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.930
She's not dead.

19:04.470 --> 19:06.771
It's a painting.

19:07.173 --> 19:10.042
- (Sighing)
- Oh, my God.

19:13.808 --> 19:15.775
The guy's an artist.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.735
He uses this palette knife
to fling paint on a canvas.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.301
In this case, red paint.

19:21.416 --> 19:23.651
But I saw him fighting with his girlfriend.

19:23.787 --> 19:26.656
It was about money. She says
they always fight about money.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.801
In fact, she had one foot out the door,

19:28.826 --> 19:31.501
but stuck around because he
finally sold his first painting.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.617
What was his name?

19:37.042 --> 19:40.416
One of those artsy types.
He goes by a single name.

19:42.731 --> 19:44.616
"Ginsberg."

19:44.912 --> 19:47.616
The painting in Robbie's apartment.

19:47.810 --> 19:49.811
Robbie bought the painting.

19:50.252 --> 19:51.252
Why?

19:51.277 --> 19:52.416
I'm not sure,

19:54.122 --> 19:56.616
but I feel...

19:56.943 --> 19:59.616
Robbie was trying to help.

20:00.793 --> 20:05.017
So our peeping Tom is a
peeping good Samaritan?

20:05.042 --> 20:08.616
I don't know yet.

20:34.846 --> 20:36.881
<i>(Clatting)</i>

20:41.829 --> 20:43.821
Is someone there?

21:04.048 --> 21:07.491
<i>(Door opens and closes)</i>

21:27.044 --> 21:28.645
What are you two doing here?

21:28.670 --> 21:30.771
We needed to calibrate some gear

21:30.796 --> 21:32.845
and thought we'd grab something for dinner.

21:32.870 --> 21:35.845
- Would you like an egg roll?
- No, I'm good.

21:35.870 --> 21:39.272
Did you see anyone getting in
or off the elevator topside?

21:39.297 --> 21:40.946
No.

21:41.878 --> 21:44.246
Okay. Enjoy.

22:06.059 --> 22:07.989
Camille.

22:10.644 --> 22:12.789
Camille.

22:14.002 --> 22:15.970
(Sighs)

22:15.995 --> 22:18.489
- Camille!
- (Gasps)

22:20.593 --> 22:23.128
- Huh?
- Oh, you're up.

22:23.153 --> 22:25.265
Well, now that you're awake.

22:25.290 --> 22:27.157
Really? Here?

22:27.182 --> 22:30.365
Get over yourself. I
thought you and I could talk.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.657
What do you need? A bedtime story?

22:32.682 --> 22:35.484
I need to understand what went wrong.

22:35.509 --> 22:38.062
Oh, my God. Why are you harping on this?

22:38.087 --> 22:40.262
Because you and I are good together.

22:41.073 --> 22:44.462
If things went too fast, we can slow down.

22:44.487 --> 22:47.462
Hang out. Go to dinner?

22:48.164 --> 22:52.134
Hold hands and take
walks? I don't want that.

22:52.434 --> 22:54.361
Not with me.

22:54.386 --> 22:57.061
Not with anybody.

22:57.086 --> 23:00.662
I'm just really diggin'
being single right now.

23:02.740 --> 23:04.759
Okay.

23:13.242 --> 23:15.210
How about now?

23:35.019 --> 23:37.086
You're still at it.

23:37.111 --> 23:40.536
Yeah, still no luck finding tank top.

23:40.561 --> 23:45.331
Meanwhile, 6F has been a very naughty boy.

23:45.356 --> 23:47.135
Okay, you need a break.

23:48.407 --> 23:51.036
I've never seen people this way before.

23:51.534 --> 23:56.135
You mean, how they behave when they
think they aren't being watched?

23:56.713 --> 24:01.836
Not just that, but being vulnerable.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.236
Real.

24:05.115 --> 24:08.736
It's intoxicating. I get
why Robbie was obsessed.

24:09.189 --> 24:12.119
Oh. Whoa.

24:12.602 --> 24:15.133
Looks like naughty boy

24:15.158 --> 24:17.426
is playing "Fifty Shades of 6F."

24:17.451 --> 24:19.452
I think you've seen enough.

24:19.477 --> 24:21.278
What's your problem?

24:21.303 --> 24:23.204
I'm just looking out for you.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.397
No, you're smothering me.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.323
Ever since that phone call this morning.

24:27.348 --> 24:29.549
All of the extra precautions at the lab,

24:29.574 --> 24:32.276
- and all of this hovering.
- I'm being responsible.

24:32.301 --> 24:33.944
I'm not your responsibility.

24:33.969 --> 24:36.687
Yes, in fact, you are.
When you're in a stitch,

24:36.712 --> 24:38.610
and you're waltzing around
some dead person's memory,

24:38.635 --> 24:40.816
it is my job to keep you safe.

24:41.136 --> 24:43.911
I know what I signed up for
and I know all the risks.

24:43.936 --> 24:46.911
All the risks? No.

24:46.936 --> 24:49.011
You don't.

24:49.507 --> 24:52.011
Everything that happens
in the lab is recorded.

24:52.036 --> 24:55.310
Archived for future reference and analysis.

24:55.335 --> 24:58.237
Okay, so?

25:00.014 --> 25:01.982
I need you to see something.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.648
Cameron: If I rip her out
now, her mind could fry!

25:07.673 --> 25:10.408
- Maggie: If you don't, she's gonna die.
- Woman: She's seizing!

25:10.443 --> 25:12.885
- Cardiac arrest!
- Cameron: We're losing her!

25:12.910 --> 25:15.914
Maggie: <i>Bounce her out of
there, Cameron, now!</i>

25:18.782 --> 25:20.482
What went wrong?

25:21.399 --> 25:23.594
Marta stayed in too long

25:24.295 --> 25:26.063
and she couldn't make
the bounce by herself.

25:26.088 --> 25:29.457
By the time I got her out, it was too late.

25:30.317 --> 25:31.883
She died?

25:31.908 --> 25:34.814
No, but she was damaged.

25:34.839 --> 25:37.282
She's been in a coma
for the last four months.

25:39.654 --> 25:42.082
It was an accident.

25:43.345 --> 25:45.681
It wasn't your fault.

25:45.706 --> 25:48.982
No, I can't risk anything
like that happening again.

25:50.851 --> 25:52.881
I can't risk you.

25:56.305 --> 25:58.881
Hey, guys? You'd better come in here.

26:04.633 --> 26:08.432
Lady and gentlemen, may I present...

26:08.683 --> 26:12.031
- (snaps fingers)
- Tank top. Apartment 6B.

26:32.775 --> 26:35.455
She just waved at us.

26:37.589 --> 26:41.155
And just invited us over for beers.

26:46.819 --> 26:48.303
No way.

26:48.328 --> 26:50.741
- Dude, you have to.
- Dude, I'm not going over there.

26:50.766 --> 26:53.110
Come on, Cameron. Take one for the team.

26:53.144 --> 26:56.113
She obviously knew Robbie was watching
her, and she obviously didn't mind.

26:56.138 --> 26:59.100
- And Robbie is obviously dead.
- Fine. Whatever. I'll go.

26:59.125 --> 27:02.272
- Like hell.
- You jealous?

27:02.309 --> 27:03.343
Disgusted.

27:03.368 --> 27:05.169
It's not like you have to sleep with her,

27:05.194 --> 27:08.210
but this is a good way to find
out what she knows about Robbie.

27:10.348 --> 27:13.417
- What if it's a trap?
- Seriously? What kind of trap?

27:13.442 --> 27:17.397
Okay, let's say she saw Robbie
spying on her. She's upset.

27:17.422 --> 27:19.025
Yeah, she seemed livid. Keep going.

27:19.050 --> 27:21.506
Okay, now let's say she
has a boyfriend. Big guy.

27:21.531 --> 27:23.912
And now let's say he's
waiting in the other room.

27:23.940 --> 27:25.574
Let's say threesome.

27:25.759 --> 27:28.108
I swear, if you don't
stop with the comments...

27:28.133 --> 27:32.766
It's not a trap. I know. Robbie
felt some emotional pull to her.

27:32.791 --> 27:35.219
- Maybe she feels the same way.
- Even more reason not to go.

27:35.244 --> 27:37.111
I can't play with people's
emotions like this.

27:37.146 --> 27:39.066
(Knock on door)

27:39.091 --> 27:41.165
I got this.

27:48.780 --> 27:50.816
- It's her.
- I got this.

27:50.841 --> 27:53.055
No. Get in the bedroom. All of you.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.948
Oh, no.

27:55.854 --> 27:57.382
Now.

28:10.677 --> 28:12.711
Uh... hi.

28:12.736 --> 28:15.504
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:15.735 --> 28:18.491
Hi. Again.

28:19.039 --> 28:21.740
Didn't you use to live
in the apartment below?

28:21.765 --> 28:23.799
Yes. Yeah, I did.

28:23.824 --> 28:26.979
I... I moved.

28:27.004 --> 28:30.443
Oh. Well, why didn't you come over?

28:30.468 --> 28:31.932
Didn't you see me waving to you?

28:31.957 --> 28:33.925
Um, yes.

28:33.950 --> 28:38.600
I noticed something like that.

28:38.625 --> 28:43.262
Listen, I'm not who you think I am.

28:43.287 --> 28:44.872
I think you are.

28:45.034 --> 28:47.068
You've been watching me for months.

28:48.608 --> 28:50.301
I know you have.

28:50.326 --> 28:55.005
Listen, yeah, about that. I'm sorry.

28:55.030 --> 28:57.665
Don't be. I model for art students.

28:57.690 --> 29:00.236
So I'm kind of used to being stared at.

29:00.261 --> 29:01.435
Oh...

29:02.194 --> 29:05.296
so why are you here?

29:06.034 --> 29:08.635
To thank you.

29:08.938 --> 29:11.248
For watching you?

29:11.273 --> 29:14.336
For sending over all those groceries.

29:14.507 --> 29:17.221
When they first got delivered, I
couldn't figure out who sent them,

29:17.246 --> 29:21.236
and then I realized that you could see
into my fridge and you saw it was empty.

29:21.743 --> 29:24.802
Yeah, I noticed that.

29:24.827 --> 29:26.967
I'm gonna pay you back
just as soon as I can.

29:26.992 --> 29:31.895
But I just wanted to tell you I
know it was you, and to thank you.

29:35.946 --> 29:38.098
The world needs more people like you.

29:39.166 --> 29:42.101
And any time you want to
come over for that beer,

29:42.126 --> 29:44.494
you know where to find me.

29:58.886 --> 30:01.854
We had Robbie all wrong.

30:01.879 --> 30:03.936
He wasn't a peeping Tom.

30:03.961 --> 30:07.096
He was a good Samaritan.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.611
(Elevator bell dings)

30:16.470 --> 30:20.022
- Any success?
- Let's just say mission not quite accomplished.

30:20.047 --> 30:23.650
We did eliminate two suspects, but still haven't
found anyone with a motive to kill Robbie.

30:23.675 --> 30:25.076
Turns out he's not a bad guy at all.

30:25.101 --> 30:27.736
- Seriously?
- Camille: He bought a painting off a struggling artist,

30:27.761 --> 30:30.166
sent groceries to a poor art school model.

30:30.191 --> 30:32.426
The guy was spying on people,
but he was trying to help them.

30:32.451 --> 30:35.320
Well, obviously, someone didn't
care for his brand of help.

30:35.345 --> 30:37.850
Stitch me back in. I must
have missed something.

30:37.875 --> 30:39.943
I don't advise it. The timing's too tight.

30:39.968 --> 30:43.251
What's left of Mr. Peterson's
memory is about to expire.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.350
I have an idea. Something I want to try.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.180
What?

30:49.205 --> 30:51.773
I'd rather just do it.

30:51.798 --> 30:54.066
If I tell you, nervous
Nellie here won't let me.

30:54.091 --> 30:56.125
If you don't tell me, cautious
Cameron is going to say no.

30:56.150 --> 30:58.752
Let me do it. It's going to be fine.

30:58.777 --> 31:00.766
What if his memory collapses while
you're trying your little experiment?

31:00.767 --> 31:01.967
I'll bounce out.

31:01.992 --> 31:06.259
Trust me, just the way
you want me to trust you.

31:13.058 --> 31:15.157
Talk to me, Goose. What do you see?

31:16.578 --> 31:20.196
Robbie is enjoying his favorite pastime.

31:20.221 --> 31:22.009
So what's this bold experiment of yours?

31:22.034 --> 31:25.603
If Robbie has been watching
the building since he moved in,

31:25.628 --> 31:28.463
that's two months of watching people
in their most private moments.

31:28.488 --> 31:31.345
Two months of learning their secrets.

31:31.370 --> 31:34.088
- Go on.
- His life was based around the telescope.

31:34.113 --> 31:36.995
I'll bet it's hypercharged with emotion.

31:46.504 --> 31:48.978
Her brain activity's off the charts.

31:49.003 --> 31:50.033
Why? What is she doing?

31:50.058 --> 31:52.494
Kirsten, check in. What
are you up to? Kirsten?!

31:52.519 --> 31:56.633
Relax. I'm speeding through Robbie's
memories from the last two months.

31:59.281 --> 32:01.282
There's an apartment on the third floor...

32:01.307 --> 32:02.689
What do you see?

32:02.714 --> 32:07.451
Curtains. They're always closed.

32:07.476 --> 32:09.727
What's inside they
don't want people to see?

32:14.081 --> 32:18.611
- Maybe it's vacant.
- No, the rental company for the building claims 100% occupancy.

32:18.636 --> 32:21.371
- Memory collapse in 20 seconds.
- Get out of there.

32:21.396 --> 32:22.950
Hang on. Do not bounce me.

32:28.975 --> 32:32.244
The mannequin in the window.

32:33.060 --> 32:35.962
It's a signal. They're
transporting something.

32:35.987 --> 32:39.923
- Kirsten, your exit pin code.
- Linus: 15 seconds.

32:41.226 --> 32:44.629
- There's a helicopter.
- Ten seconds.

32:44.654 --> 32:46.366
- Nine.
- I'm bouncing you.

32:46.391 --> 32:49.065
- You know you can't do that.
- Eight.

32:49.090 --> 32:52.966
Seven, six...

32:53.274 --> 32:54.541
Five...

32:54.566 --> 32:58.269
Four, three,

32:58.294 --> 33:01.666
- two.
- iheartlinus!

33:02.258 --> 33:05.565
(Gasping)

33:06.593 --> 33:08.455
I told you to trust me.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.054
What happened? What did you see?

33:11.079 --> 33:12.871
I think Robbie's killer.

33:18.766 --> 33:21.102
The apartment was built in 1942.

33:21.258 --> 33:23.924
There are two entrances...
one in the front with a doorman

33:23.949 --> 33:25.200
and one in the back through the alley.

33:25.225 --> 33:28.321
Now the original storefront on the ground
floor used to keep inventory upstairs

33:28.346 --> 33:32.454
in apartment 3C, which they used to
move merchandise with a private elevator.

33:32.479 --> 33:35.579
The boutique that we saw in
Kirsten's stitch... daisies & dots...

33:35.604 --> 33:37.905
that occupies the same ground floor space.

33:37.930 --> 33:40.547
Apartment 3C is leased to the same owner.

33:40.572 --> 33:43.051
But what are they using it
for? To store women's clothes?

33:43.076 --> 33:44.931
Maybe, if they're stolen.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.091
It has to be something illegal.

33:47.116 --> 33:50.118
Why else would they go to the
trouble to keep it a secret?

33:51.845 --> 33:55.395
And then use the mannequin
to signal the van?

33:55.420 --> 33:57.126
Mannequins aren't creepy enough.

33:57.151 --> 33:59.192
I'll call Fisher. He'll
need to get a warrant.

33:59.386 --> 34:02.321
Looks like your neighbor may have
stumbled upon something after all.

34:02.346 --> 34:05.181
And paid for it with his life.

34:08.353 --> 34:13.454
(Accented) Lifeless eyes.
Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes.

34:13.726 --> 34:17.069
- Anyone?
- <i>Jaws</i>. Quint's monologue.

34:17.826 --> 34:20.344
Classic Spielberg. I feel ya, bro.

34:20.594 --> 34:23.429
Why is quoting movie
lines such a guy thing?

34:23.455 --> 34:25.641
Freaky mannequin's arm is down.

34:25.643 --> 34:28.483
Which means they're in a holding
pattern. Any activity in the apartment?

34:28.945 --> 34:31.304
Camille: Nada. The blinds are still down.

34:31.516 --> 34:35.040
- Where's Fisher already?
- Maggie said he's on his way.

34:37.333 --> 34:39.368
Where are you going?

34:40.725 --> 34:43.060
To the back of the building.
I need to see what's in that apartment.

34:43.085 --> 34:46.172
Right, 'cause you haven't done anything
reckless or foolhardy in almost an hour.

34:46.197 --> 34:50.404
Okay, don't take your eyes
off the stiff. Keep us posted.

34:50.429 --> 34:52.235
Roger that.

34:54.755 --> 34:57.424
Okay, 3C should be at the end of the hall.

34:58.839 --> 35:00.807
- Hey.
- What?

35:00.981 --> 35:03.805
Thank you for going through
with the stitch before.

35:03.830 --> 35:06.666
I know you didn't want to.

35:07.266 --> 35:10.514
Wow. An expression of gratitude.

35:11.689 --> 35:13.934
You must think I'm an awful person.

35:14.634 --> 35:18.318
Actually, all things
considered, on certain occasions,

35:18.343 --> 35:21.828
I'd say you're pretty remarkable.

35:22.067 --> 35:25.169
Talk about a qualified compliment.

35:25.204 --> 35:27.648
Okay, we still need to
have an understanding.

35:27.673 --> 35:30.217
If you ever feel uncomfortable in the lab

35:30.242 --> 35:32.143
or experience any side effects,

35:32.177 --> 35:34.836
promise you'll tell me, K?

35:36.222 --> 35:39.257
If you promise me no more secrets.

35:40.364 --> 35:42.298
You should've told me about Marta.

35:42.323 --> 35:43.723
You're right.

35:44.595 --> 35:48.565
And I'm not her, okay?

35:48.599 --> 35:50.400
You don't have to worry about me.

35:50.435 --> 35:52.162
That I can't promise,

35:52.187 --> 35:55.578
but I'll try.

35:59.632 --> 36:03.210
3F, 3B, 3D.

36:03.614 --> 36:05.730
Where's 3C?

36:05.755 --> 36:07.623
(Sighs)

36:07.648 --> 36:09.826
Apartments don't just disappear.

36:19.490 --> 36:21.071
What are you doing?

36:21.096 --> 36:22.625
Trick Ed taught me

36:22.650 --> 36:26.156
about how to find an
empty space behind a wall.

36:29.974 --> 36:31.875
- (Thuds)
- Okay.

36:32.341 --> 36:35.319
There is a large gap
behind this wall right here.

36:35.956 --> 36:38.455
Someone plastered over the door?

36:46.012 --> 36:50.518
- What are you doing?
- A little reconnaissance. I need to see.

36:58.969 --> 37:00.727
We're in the apartment.

37:00.752 --> 37:03.575
We need to hurry. Someone
would've heard that.

37:03.866 --> 37:06.095
Who lives like this?

37:13.008 --> 37:16.684
Cameron, take a look at these.

37:20.351 --> 37:24.079
Vietnam, Afghanistan, Mexico, Turkey.

37:25.848 --> 37:27.816
All women.

37:28.084 --> 37:30.786
They're human traffickers.

37:31.203 --> 37:34.048
We better call Fisher.
Get him down here now.

37:35.108 --> 37:37.438
Hey, wonder twins. You there?

37:37.463 --> 37:40.365
- Yeah, what's up?
- We got a high-five from the mannequin.

37:40.390 --> 37:42.130
Kirsten: <i> Let's go.</i>

37:48.626 --> 37:50.593
Van's here. Right on cue.

37:59.844 --> 38:02.024
What are they loading?

38:03.067 --> 38:06.136
I can't see. They must be loading
the van through the side door.

38:07.358 --> 38:10.784
Kids, van's leaving. Hurry!

38:15.177 --> 38:16.936
(Engine turns over)

38:32.178 --> 38:34.115
(Siren wailing)

38:37.998 --> 38:41.850
Police! Hands in the air. Hands in the air!

38:41.875 --> 38:44.026
Hands in the air! Hold it.

38:55.267 --> 38:59.371
It's okay. You don't have to hide anymore.

39:05.913 --> 39:08.948
(Sighs) Now I've seen enough.

39:23.490 --> 39:26.903
Fisher said that the driver
confessed to killing Robbie Peterson.

39:26.928 --> 39:28.801
Wow, he was a guardian angel after all.

39:28.826 --> 39:31.828
I mean, without Robbie, all
those women would have been lost.

39:31.853 --> 39:34.457
Now we know that Cameron wasn't the target.

39:34.482 --> 39:37.317
- To Robbie Peterson.
- To Robbie.

39:37.342 --> 39:40.825
Wait. Cameron should be in
on this. I'll go get him.

39:42.195 --> 39:43.665
- Should we wait for them?
- No.

39:43.690 --> 39:46.359
- No.
