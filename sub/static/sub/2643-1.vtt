WEBVTT

00:05.168 --> 00:07.269
And now the
kung pao chicken.

00:07.270 --> 00:08.653
Ah, yeah.
Wow.

00:08.654 --> 00:10.072
Smooth.

00:10.073 --> 00:11.957
And finally,

00:11.958 --> 00:13.792
my moo shu pork.

00:15.595 --> 00:16.879
Whoo-hoo!

00:16.880 --> 00:18.630
Oh, there you have
it, gentlemen.

00:18.631 --> 00:22.801
Our entire dinner
unpacked by robot.

00:22.802 --> 00:25.187
And it only took 28 minutes.

00:26.139 --> 00:27.289
Impressive,

00:27.290 --> 00:29.658
but we must be cautious.
Why?

00:29.659 --> 00:32.644
Today, it's a Chinese food
retrieval robot.

00:32.645 --> 00:35.180
Tomorrow,
it travels back in time

00:35.181 --> 00:37.682
and tries to kill Sarah Connor.

00:37.683 --> 00:39.985
I don't think that's
going to happen, Sheldon.

00:39.986 --> 00:41.370
No one ever does.

00:41.371 --> 00:42.988
That's why it happens.

00:43.990 --> 00:45.707
Hey. Is the food here?

00:45.708 --> 00:47.009
Ooh. What's that?

00:47.010 --> 00:48.277
That, dear lady,

00:48.278 --> 00:50.929
is the Wolowitz
Programmable Hand,

00:50.930 --> 00:52.598
designed
for extravehicular repairs

00:52.599 --> 00:55.050
on the International
Space Station.

00:55.051 --> 00:56.635
Ah, cool.

00:56.636 --> 00:58.337
Ask me to pass the soy sauce.

00:58.338 --> 01:01.106
Oh, does that come up much
on the space station?

01:01.107 --> 01:04.543
Mostly with Asian
and Jewish astronauts.

01:04.544 --> 01:06.662
All right. Pass the soy sauce.
Coming up.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.324 --> 01:19.942
So how's work?

01:19.943 --> 01:21.393
Oh, it's not bad.

01:21.394 --> 01:22.945
Kind of hungry.

01:22.946 --> 01:24.780
Yeah, we all are.

01:24.781 --> 01:26.582
Just wait.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.333
You realize, Penny,
that the technology

01:28.334 --> 01:30.485
that went into this arm
will one day make

01:30.486 --> 01:33.906
unskilled food servers
such as yourself obsolete.

01:33.907 --> 01:35.340
Really?

01:35.341 --> 01:37.976
They're going to make a robot
that spits on your hamburger?

01:39.529 --> 01:41.129
I thought you
broke up with her.

01:41.130 --> 01:42.881
Why is she here?

01:43.783 --> 01:45.117
Okay, here we go.

01:45.118 --> 01:47.603
Passing the soy sauce.

01:49.022 --> 01:51.273
Put out your hand.

01:53.776 --> 01:55.310
Oh!

01:56.696 --> 01:57.829
That's amazing.

01:57.830 --> 01:59.264
I wouldn't say amazing.

01:59.265 --> 02:01.266
At best,
it's a modest leap forward

02:01.267 --> 02:02.818
from the basic technology

02:02.819 --> 02:05.654
that gave us
Country Bear Jamboree.

02:06.489 --> 02:07.956
Hey, Sheldon?

02:07.957 --> 02:09.875
Yes?

02:15.999 --> 02:17.966
Peace?

02:17.967 --> 02:19.551
No, not peace.

02:19.552 --> 02:20.919

Does NASA know you're using
that thing as a napkin holder?

02:50.819 --> 02:54.655
You kidding? They still think
it's in a secure locker at JPL.

02:55.524 --> 02:56.724
You stole it?

02:56.725 --> 02:58.075
Borrowed.

02:58.076 --> 03:00.678
The trick is to carry it out
to your car like you own it.

03:02.314 --> 03:04.832
Excuse me.

03:06.051 --> 03:07.418
Oh.

03:07.419 --> 03:08.920
Amy's at the dry cleaners,

03:08.921 --> 03:11.456
and she's made a very
amusing pun.

03:11.457 --> 03:14.325
"I don't care
for perchloroethylene,

03:14.326 --> 03:17.912
and I don't like glycol ether."

03:22.568 --> 03:23.634
Get it?

03:23.635 --> 03:26.954
She doesn't like glycol <i>ether.</i>

03:28.023 --> 03:30.691
Sounds like "either."

03:34.730 --> 03:37.548
"L-O-L."

03:37.549 --> 03:40.034
Who's Amy?
His girlfriend.

03:40.035 --> 03:42.119
Sheldon has a girlfriend?
She's not my girlfriend.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.155
How long
has this been going on?
Four months.

03:44.156 --> 03:46.290
She's not my girlfriend.
Are you telling me, for
the past four months

03:46.291 --> 03:47.742
I have been asking you,
"What's new?"

03:47.743 --> 03:49.327
and you never thought
to go with,

03:49.328 --> 03:50.545
"Sheldon has a girlfriend"?

03:50.546 --> 03:52.446
She's <i>not</i> my girlfriend.

03:52.447 --> 03:53.531
Ah... d-d-d-d...

03:53.532 --> 03:55.249
How did they meet?

03:55.250 --> 03:57.468
Raj and I entered Sheldon's
information on a dating site,

03:57.469 --> 03:59.870
and it spit out
Amy Farrah Fowler.

03:59.871 --> 04:02.173
Oh, my God!
Sheldon and Amy.

04:02.174 --> 04:04.008
Or, as we
call them, "Shamy."

04:05.811 --> 04:06.978
Shamy.

04:06.979 --> 04:09.230
I am so digging the Shamy.

04:09.231 --> 04:11.649
All right,
everyone pay attention.

04:11.650 --> 04:13.818
Yes, I have a friend
named Amy Farrah Fowler.

04:13.819 --> 04:15.386
Yes, she is female.

04:15.387 --> 04:17.822
Yes, we communicate
on a daily basis,

04:17.822 --> 04:20.241
but no, she is not
my girlfriend.

04:20.242 --> 04:22.727
Okay, well, what do
you communicate about?

04:22.728 --> 04:26.781
Well, my work in physics,
her work in neurobiology,

04:26.782 --> 04:28.499
and most recently,
the possibility

04:28.500 --> 04:31.035
of our having a child together.

04:37.843 --> 04:40.011
Thank you.

04:41.179 --> 04:42.680
Wait a minute-- a child?

04:42.681 --> 04:43.898
You never see this girl.

04:43.899 --> 04:45.866
You just e-mail
and text and Twitter.

04:45.867 --> 04:47.918
Now you're considering
having a baby?

04:47.919 --> 04:50.638
Amy pointed out
that between the two of us,

04:50.639 --> 04:52.573
our genetic material
has the potential

04:52.574 --> 04:54.709
of producing the first in a line

04:54.710 --> 04:57.428
of intellectually superior,
benign overlords

04:57.429 --> 05:00.698
to guide humanity
to a brighter tomorrow.

05:02.134 --> 05:03.884
I'm guessing
that future historians

05:03.885 --> 05:05.903
will condemn us
for not taking

05:05.904 --> 05:08.122
this opportunity
to kill Sheldon.

05:08.991 --> 05:11.208
Okay, I have
a question.

05:11.209 --> 05:12.493
Yes, Penny.

05:12.494 --> 05:14.412
You don't even like people
touching you.

05:14.413 --> 05:16.130
How are you going to have sex?

05:17.716 --> 05:19.884
Why on Earth would we have sex?

05:21.887 --> 05:24.672
Oh, honey, did your mom
not have the talk with you?

05:24.673 --> 05:28.175
You know, when your
private parts started growing?

05:28.176 --> 05:31.262
I'm quite aware of the way
humans usually reproduce,

05:31.263 --> 05:33.431
which is messy,
unsanitary,

05:33.432 --> 05:35.766
and based on living next
to you for three years,

05:35.767 --> 05:39.687
involves loud and unnecessary
appeals to a deity.

05:39.688 --> 05:40.821
Oh, God.

05:40.822 --> 05:42.490
Yes, exactly.

05:45.110 --> 05:47.745
Consequently,
if Amy and I choose

05:47.746 --> 05:49.363
to bring new life
into this world,

05:49.364 --> 05:51.248
it will be accomplished
clinically,

05:51.249 --> 05:54.485
with fertility experts in a lab
with petri dishes.

05:54.486 --> 05:55.620
Which reminds me--

05:55.621 --> 05:58.623
you have broad hips
and a certain corn-fed vigor.

05:58.624 --> 06:01.442
Is your womb available
for rental?

06:02.911 --> 06:06.013
Still digging the Shamy?

06:06.014 --> 06:07.431
Look, Sheldon,

06:07.432 --> 06:10.000
before you race off to
the fertility clinic,

06:10.001 --> 06:11.469
you might want
to think about--

06:11.470 --> 06:12.603
uh, gee, I don't know--

06:12.604 --> 06:14.905
maybe actually spending
some time with her.

06:14.906 --> 06:16.857
You mean dating?
Yeah.

06:16.858 --> 06:18.609
I can't date Amy.
Why not?

06:18.610 --> 06:20.361
She's not my girlfriend.

06:20.362 --> 06:22.780
Okay, look, don't think of it
as dating a girlfriend.

06:22.781 --> 06:24.115
Think of it as, uh...

06:24.116 --> 06:26.417
getting to know
the future mother of your child.

06:26.418 --> 06:28.235
Oh.

06:28.236 --> 06:30.604
I hadn't considered that.

06:30.605 --> 06:33.424
I suppose she will have
to have access to our progeny.

06:33.425 --> 06:35.292
And you don't think
I can achieve

06:35.293 --> 06:37.978
the required intimacy
via text messaging?

06:37.979 --> 06:39.163
Probably not.

06:39.164 --> 06:40.364
Huh.

06:40.365 --> 06:41.682
It would appear as if

06:41.683 --> 06:44.535
the phone companies
have been lying to me.

06:46.838 --> 06:49.140
Penny.

06:49.141 --> 06:51.559
Penny. Penny.

06:52.594 --> 06:55.396
You do realize I stand
on the other side of the door

06:55.397 --> 06:58.182
waiting for you to finish
knocking three times.

06:58.183 --> 07:01.519
I know. I can see the shadow
of your feet under the door.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.472
Yeah, my point is
it's a waste of time.

07:04.473 --> 07:05.723
If you're looking for an example

07:05.724 --> 07:07.825
of a waste of time,
I would refer you

07:07.826 --> 07:09.744
to the conversation
we're having right now.

07:09.745 --> 07:11.328
What do you want?

07:11.329 --> 07:13.531
I've decided to take your advice
and have arranged

07:13.532 --> 07:15.833
to go on a date
with Amy Farrah Fowler.

07:15.834 --> 07:16.734
Oh, that's great.

07:16.735 --> 07:18.035
Have fun.
Wait.

07:18.036 --> 07:19.587
You have to drive me.

07:19.588 --> 07:22.039
What?
You know I don't drive.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.541
Well, go ask Leonard.
I did.

07:23.542 --> 07:26.143
He said-- and I quote--
"Ask Penny.

07:26.144 --> 07:28.729
It was her cockamamy idea."

07:28.730 --> 07:30.715
Leonard said "cockamamy"?

07:30.716 --> 07:31.915
Actually, I'm paraphrasing.

07:31.916 --> 07:34.418
Having been raised
in a Christian household,

07:34.419 --> 07:37.438
I'm uncomfortable
with the language he used.

07:37.439 --> 07:38.739
And to be honest,

07:38.740 --> 07:41.225
I'm not entirely comfortable
with "cockamamy."

07:41.226 --> 07:43.277
Okay, fine. When's the date?

07:43.278 --> 07:44.945
Now.
Now?

07:44.946 --> 07:47.031
Hurry. We're going to be late.

07:47.866 --> 07:49.817
Sheldon,
did it ever occur to you

07:49.818 --> 07:51.652
that I might have other plans?

07:51.653 --> 07:52.803
I'm sorry.

07:52.804 --> 07:54.305
Do you have other plans?

07:57.325 --> 08:00.361
Well, no, not per se, but...

08:00.362 --> 08:03.297
So this conversation
is as pointless

08:03.298 --> 08:06.300
as your door-knocking soliloquy?

08:07.135 --> 08:10.638
Let me get my...
cockamamy keys.

08:12.758 --> 08:15.926
Oh, God, that feels so good.

08:20.131 --> 08:21.799
Yeah, that's the spot.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.734
Oh, baby.

08:23.735 --> 08:27.104
MRS. WOLOWITZ
Howard, dinner's ready!

08:27.105 --> 08:28.689
I'll eat later.

08:28.690 --> 08:30.991
I'm busy!

08:30.992 --> 08:32.193
Oh, yeah.

08:32.193 --> 08:34.410
Just like a real hand.

08:41.837 --> 08:44.038
Hmm.

08:46.958 --> 08:49.009
Thank you
for driving me.

08:49.010 --> 08:51.662
You're welcome.

08:51.663 --> 08:54.198
I wish you weren't
wearing flip-flops.

08:54.199 --> 08:56.767
It's dangerous
to drive in flip-flops.

08:56.768 --> 08:58.803
Sheldon.
Sorry.

08:58.804 --> 09:02.773
I just don't want to be
yet another flip-flop fatality.

09:03.575 --> 09:05.893
Can I ask you
a question?

09:05.894 --> 09:08.479
Given your
community college education,

09:08.480 --> 09:11.982
I encourage you to ask me
as many as possible.

09:12.951 --> 09:14.869
Yeah.
Well, my question is--

09:14.870 --> 09:17.521
and I'm pretty sure
I know the answer--

09:17.522 --> 09:19.523
is this your first date?

09:19.524 --> 09:21.375
That depends.

09:21.376 --> 09:23.577
Does square-dancing
with my sister

09:23.578 --> 09:26.363
at a Teens for Jesus
Fourth of July Hoedown

09:26.364 --> 09:27.665
count as a date?

09:27.666 --> 09:29.166
No.

09:29.167 --> 09:31.552
Then, this is my first date.

09:32.554 --> 09:34.338
Okay. Well, then,
there's a couple of things

09:34.339 --> 09:35.606
you should probably know.

09:35.607 --> 09:39.042
I have a master's degree
and two doctorates.

09:39.043 --> 09:42.763
The things I should know,
I do know.

09:42.764 --> 09:46.600
My point is, I know more
about dating than you,

09:46.601 --> 09:48.569
and if you were as smart
as you think you are,

09:48.570 --> 09:49.770
you would listen to me.

09:49.771 --> 09:53.223
If you know so much,
how come I have a date tonight

09:53.224 --> 09:56.493
and you have nothing better
to do than drive me to it?

09:59.030 --> 10:00.748
Fair point.

10:04.119 --> 10:05.452
You know,
there's something

10:05.453 --> 10:07.187
I've always wondered
about Aquaman.

10:07.188 --> 10:10.491
Yeah?
Where does he poop?

10:11.760 --> 10:13.477
What?

10:13.478 --> 10:15.930
What would a toilet
look like in Atlantis?

10:15.931 --> 10:17.631
How would you flush it?

10:17.632 --> 10:21.552
And when you did flush it,
where would the poop go?

10:24.255 --> 10:25.823
Hold that thought.

10:27.192 --> 10:28.909
Hey, Howard.
What's going on?

10:30.195 --> 10:31.362
What...

10:31.363 --> 10:33.464
Hold on.
Howard, Howard, slow down.

10:33.465 --> 10:36.650
The robot hand
is stuck on your what?

10:39.454 --> 10:42.106
You're not going
to believe this.

10:55.971 --> 10:57.805
So, um, Amy,
Sheldon tells me

10:57.806 --> 11:01.759
you're a neuro...
something-or-other.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.245
Neurobiologist.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.481
Your "check engine" light is on.

11:08.701 --> 11:09.934
Yeah, it's okay.

11:09.935 --> 11:10.952
But the light indicates...

11:10.953 --> 11:12.453
Don't bother.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.022
I've wasted many an hour

11:14.023 --> 11:16.241
tilting at
that particular windmill.

11:19.078 --> 11:20.628
Uh, what is that
scent you're wearing?

11:20.629 --> 11:21.713
It smells great.

11:21.714 --> 11:24.132
Dandruff shampoo.

11:25.634 --> 11:28.086
I have dry scalp.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.170
Ah.

11:29.171 --> 11:31.339
Well, your hair
looks very nice.

11:31.340 --> 11:33.508
Are you a homosexual?

11:35.127 --> 11:37.962
No, no, I'm just giving
you a compliment.

11:37.963 --> 11:39.898
Hmm.

11:39.899 --> 11:43.184
Would have been more flattered
if you were a homosexual.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.905
Guys, how 'bout
some music?

11:46.906 --> 11:48.472
Oh, no, I wouldn't
care for that.

11:48.473 --> 11:49.490
Amy?

11:49.491 --> 11:50.641
No, thank you.

11:50.642 --> 11:52.460
Okay.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.696
Uncomfortable
silence it is.

11:58.117 --> 12:01.419
Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy

12:01.420 --> 12:03.838
what it was like for you
growing up in Texas?

12:03.839 --> 12:05.757
No.

12:06.909 --> 12:09.327
Well, why don't
you tell her?

12:09.328 --> 12:11.713
All right.

12:11.714 --> 12:13.047
It was hell.

12:14.833 --> 12:17.101
Any follow up, Amy?

12:18.604 --> 12:20.104
No.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.611
I myself grew
up in Nebraska.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.512
Small town
outside of Omaha.

12:28.513 --> 12:32.617
Nice place, mostly family farms,
a few meth labs.

12:33.786 --> 12:37.188
I'm sorry, how is this better
than uncomfortable silence?

12:37.189 --> 12:38.189
I don't know.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.857
I was just trying something.

12:40.692 --> 12:42.460
Muggles.

12:49.785 --> 12:53.588
You slipped and fell
into a robot hand?

12:55.441 --> 12:57.241
Yes.

12:57.242 --> 13:00.028
Penis first?

13:03.265 --> 13:05.216
Yes. Now, help me!

13:05.217 --> 13:07.068
I'd suggest a lubricant,
but I have a feeling

13:07.069 --> 13:08.820
you fell on some
of that as well.

13:09.772 --> 13:11.606
Not funny, Leonard.

13:11.607 --> 13:14.725
Really? A robot hand's got
a death grip on your junk, dude.

13:14.726 --> 13:15.743
That's funny, ask anyone.

13:16.945 --> 13:20.248
Plea-- before my mother
walks in, get this off me!

13:20.249 --> 13:21.199
Okay, let's see.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.166
No, no!
Don't touch.

13:22.167 --> 13:23.234
The program
is paused.

13:23.235 --> 13:24.702
Well, then let's
un-pause it.

13:24.703 --> 13:26.170
No, no! I loaded
the wrong program.

13:26.171 --> 13:27.922
The hand thinks it's holding
a screwdriver in outer space.

13:27.923 --> 13:31.409
If you continue the program,
it's gonna start twisting.

13:32.261 --> 13:34.078
A-All right.

13:34.079 --> 13:35.630
Um, how about this.

13:35.631 --> 13:38.716
When-when Winnie the Pooh
got his head stuck

13:38.717 --> 13:41.719
in the honey tree,
his friends all grabbed onto him

13:41.720 --> 13:43.738
and pulled and pulled.

13:44.973 --> 13:46.557
You do what you want,

13:46.558 --> 13:48.526
I'm not touching another
man's honey tree.

13:49.928 --> 13:51.813
All right, uh,
forget pulling.

13:51.814 --> 13:54.198
How about we get
an electric saw and cut it off?

13:54.199 --> 13:56.067
What?! No saws!

13:56.068 --> 13:59.270
One circumcision was enough.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.291
How about an
acetylene torch?

14:03.292 --> 14:05.626
Okay, I can't believe
this needs to be said out loud.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.078
No pulling, no saws, no torches.

14:07.079 --> 14:09.047
Well, then what do
you want us to do?

14:09.048 --> 14:11.816
MRS. WOLOWITZ
Howard, I made cookies for you

14:11.817 --> 14:14.502
and your little friends!

14:14.503 --> 14:16.804
That's great, Mom, thanks!

14:16.805 --> 14:19.674
I'll bring them up
with some Hawaiian Punch!

14:19.675 --> 14:21.125
Don't come up here!

14:21.126 --> 14:24.228
Why not?! Are you
ashamed of your mother?!

14:24.229 --> 14:26.731
Yes, but that's not the point!

14:26.732 --> 14:28.766
Get me out of here.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.634
You have any ideas, Raj?

14:30.635 --> 14:34.005
Right now, all I can think about
is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.

14:41.080 --> 14:45.183
Hey, here's another possible
topic of conversation.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.001
This is a big night for Sheldon.

14:47.002 --> 14:49.070
Right, Sheldon?

14:49.071 --> 14:51.873
Big night?

14:51.874 --> 14:54.408
The winter solstice
is a big night.

14:55.194 --> 14:56.461
It's over 14 hours

14:56.462 --> 14:57.912
in Southern California.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.998
That's an amusing factoid.

15:00.999 --> 15:03.384
Thank you.

15:03.385 --> 15:05.636
No, no.

15:05.637 --> 15:10.241
My point is, uh, tonight is
Sheldon's first official date.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.943
Discuss.

15:11.944 --> 15:13.177
Is this true?

15:13.178 --> 15:16.514
Apparently, a semi-incestuous
Teens for Jesus

15:16.515 --> 15:18.849
Fourth of July Hoedown
didn't count.

15:20.869 --> 15:22.236
So, um, Amy, what about you?

15:22.237 --> 15:23.204
Do you date much?

15:23.205 --> 15:24.522
Once a year.

15:24.523 --> 15:26.657
It's a deal I made
with my mother in exchange for

15:26.658 --> 15:28.843
her silence on the matter,
as well as the occasional use

15:28.844 --> 15:30.027
of her George Foreman Grill

15:30.028 --> 15:33.548
that seals in the flavor
without the fat.

15:34.933 --> 15:36.000
How about you, Penny?

15:36.001 --> 15:37.218
Do you go on many dates?

15:37.219 --> 15:39.137
Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many.

15:39.138 --> 15:40.138
A few.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.561
What's...
?

15:46.562 --> 15:47.762
Your characterization of

15:47.763 --> 15:50.714
approximately 171 different men
as "a few."

15:50.715 --> 15:51.949
What...

15:52.568 --> 15:55.603
Where did you
get 171 men?

15:55.604 --> 15:57.088
Simple extrapolation.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.106
In the three years
that I've known you,

15:59.107 --> 16:00.491
you were single for two.

16:00.492 --> 16:03.411
During that time,
I saw 17 different suitors.

16:03.412 --> 16:06.781
If we work backwards,
correcting for observation bias

16:06.782 --> 16:08.866
and postulate an initial
dating age of 15...

16:08.867 --> 16:09.917
Whoa, wait,
wait, wait.

16:09.918 --> 16:12.837
I did not start dating at 15.

16:12.838 --> 16:14.005
I'm sorry. Sixteen?

16:14.006 --> 16:15.339
Fourteen.

16:16.124 --> 16:17.942
My mistake.

16:17.943 --> 16:20.344
Now, assuming the left side
of a bell curve

16:20.345 --> 16:22.580
peaking around the present,
that would bring the total

16:22.581 --> 16:25.433
up to 193 men.

16:26.385 --> 16:27.852
Plus or minus eight men.

16:29.004 --> 16:30.638
Remarkable.

16:30.639 --> 16:33.174
Did you have sexual intercourse
with all of these men?

16:33.175 --> 16:34.559
No.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.726
Although that number would be

16:35.727 --> 16:37.612
fairly easy
to calculate.
Oh.

16:37.613 --> 16:39.564
Based on the number of
awkward encounters I've had

16:39.565 --> 16:41.566
with strange men leaving
her apartment in the morning,

16:41.567 --> 16:43.201
plus the number of times

16:43.202 --> 16:45.069
she's returned home
wearing the same clothes

16:45.070 --> 16:46.270
she wore the night before...

16:46.271 --> 16:48.439
Okay, Sheldon, I think
you've made your point.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.907
So we multiply 193--

16:49.908 --> 16:53.411
minus 21 men
before the loss of virginity--

16:53.412 --> 16:54.795
so 172

16:54.796 --> 16:57.632
times 0.18 gives us...

16:57.633 --> 17:00.251
30.96 sexual partners.

17:01.303 --> 17:03.054
Let's round that up to 31.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.590
Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.759
That is not even close
to the real number.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.762
I'm gonna need
a drink over here.

17:11.762 --> 17:13.013
This is very interesting.

17:13.015 --> 17:14.699
Cultural perceptions
are subjective.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.184
Penny, to your mind,
are you a slut?

17:18.069 --> 17:21.705
No! No!

17:21.707 --> 17:23.674
No.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.694
Let's just all finish
our dinners, okay?

17:26.694 --> 17:28.613
This is
an interesting topic.

17:28.614 --> 17:31.148
How many sexual encounters
have you had?

17:31.149 --> 17:33.484
Does volunteering
for a scientific experiment

17:33.485 --> 17:35.503
in which orgasm was achieved
by electronically

17:35.504 --> 17:38.089
stimulating the pleasure centers
of the brain count?

17:39.341 --> 17:41.442
I should think so.

17:41.443 --> 17:43.728
Then 128.

17:51.186 --> 17:54.672
Okay, come on.

17:54.673 --> 17:56.857
Almost there.

18:02.064 --> 18:03.847
Don't tug.
No tugging.

18:03.848 --> 18:06.484
Next time, take your own advice.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.653
Excuse me,
could you help us out?

18:08.654 --> 18:11.072
My, my, my.

18:11.073 --> 18:13.040
What do we have here?

18:14.743 --> 18:16.077
I slipped and fell.

18:16.078 --> 18:17.878
Yeah, we get that a lot.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.715
What is this?

18:20.716 --> 18:22.883
It's a robot arm.

18:22.884 --> 18:25.419
Where's the rest of the robot?

18:25.420 --> 18:27.505
I only built the arm.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.174
'Cause that's all
you needed, right?

18:31.843 --> 18:34.228
Can you please
just help me?!

18:34.229 --> 18:35.513
All right, all right.

18:35.514 --> 18:38.349
Hang on, stay calm.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.718
I need an orderly
with a wheelchair.

18:40.719 --> 18:44.922
I got a robot hand grasping
a man's penis out here.

18:46.241 --> 18:48.442
You think you could be
a little more discreet?

18:48.443 --> 18:49.977
I'm sorry,
we don't have a code for

18:49.978 --> 18:52.330
"robot hand
grasping a man's penis."

18:53.248 --> 18:55.065
Why is it hooked up
to a computer?

18:55.066 --> 18:56.600
Uh, it's what
controls the arm.

18:56.601 --> 18:57.618
But it's frozen.

18:57.619 --> 19:00.421
Did you try turning it off
and back on again?

19:00.422 --> 19:03.290
No, you see, it's more
complicated than that.

19:03.291 --> 19:05.059
No, wait!

19:11.750 --> 19:15.302
Winnie the Pooh
is out of the honey tree.

19:15.303 --> 19:19.557
Now can we have cookies
and Hawaiian Punch?

19:25.306 --> 19:26.639
You were right.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.275
This was a very
productive evening.

19:29.276 --> 19:33.446
I saw a whole new side of
Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.

19:33.447 --> 19:37.317
I did not have
sex with 31 guys.

19:37.318 --> 19:38.651
I'll be happy
to check the math,

19:38.652 --> 19:41.988
but numbers
don't lie, Penny.

19:41.989 --> 19:43.189
In any event,

19:43.190 --> 19:46.793
now that Amy and I have
spent quality time together,

19:46.794 --> 19:48.294
I feel much
more confident

19:48.295 --> 19:50.797
proceeding to the next
stage of our relationship.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.165
And that is?

19:52.166 --> 19:53.917
Using in vitro
fertilization

19:53.918 --> 19:57.637
and a surrogate uterus to
gift humanity with our progeny.

19:59.090 --> 20:00.924
You're still
on that?

20:00.925 --> 20:05.845
In these uncertain times,
doesn't humanity deserve a gift?

20:05.846 --> 20:07.981
Okay, you know what?

20:07.982 --> 20:10.433
I'm gonna come at this
in a whole new way.

20:10.434 --> 20:13.570
Sheldon, if you try to make
a baby with Amy in a petri dish,

20:13.571 --> 20:15.822
I'm gonna tell
your mother on you.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.657
That's no threat.

20:17.658 --> 20:19.742
My mother's always
wanted a grandchild.

20:19.743 --> 20:22.996
Really? Your deeply religious
born-again Christian mother

20:22.997 --> 20:25.415
wants a test-tube grandbaby
born out of wedlock?

20:29.336 --> 20:31.087
Curses.

20:31.088 --> 20:33.006
If I'd thought of that
in the first place,

20:33.007 --> 20:35.258
I could've saved myself
this whole night.

20:35.259 --> 20:36.759
Well, it's not that late.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.295
You could still go out
and look for number 32.

20:43.267 --> 20:46.102
Good night.

20:46.103 --> 20:48.354
Hey, Howard,
what's up?

20:48.355 --> 20:50.256
I've decided
not to procreate.

20:50.257 --> 20:52.475
Yeah, yeah, great.

20:52.476 --> 20:53.776
Howard, uh, slow down.

20:53.777 --> 20:55.778
What do you mean
it happened again?
