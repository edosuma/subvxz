WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.904
HEY, HEY,
CLEAR ALL THIS STUFF, OKAY?

00:03.904 --> 00:05.739
IT'S POKER NIGHT.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.608
I CAN'T PLAY.
I GOT A TON OF HOMEWORK.

00:07.608 --> 00:10.711
OH, YEAH. ANGIE TOLD ME
YOU WERE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

00:10.711 --> 00:14.215
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
THE GRADES FOR CLOWN COLLEGE.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.419
I'M GETTING A DEGREE TO INSPIRE
MY SON TO GO TO COLLEGE.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.620
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:19.620 --> 00:22.022
WE'LL PLAY IN THE GARAGE.
GOOD.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.358
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL, GEORGE.
THANKS, ERNIE.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.160
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THE TALK AT THE FACTORY

00:26.160 --> 00:29.163
IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA FAIL, BUT
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.299
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA STUDY
AS HARD AS YOU HAVE TO

00:31.299 --> 00:36.470
BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF GUY
YOU ARE, GEORGE LOPEZ.
YOU GOT MONEY ON THIS?

00:36.470 --> 00:39.173
300 BUCKS YOU WON'T
MAKE IT A WEEK.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.078
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MOM?

00:44.078 --> 00:48.282
ARE YOU BETTING THAT
I'M GONNA FLUNK OUT OF COLLEGE?
NO WAY. I LEARNED MY LESSON.

00:48.282 --> 00:51.352
I LOST A FORTUNE WHEN YOU
FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.354
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY OUT.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.456
I GOTTA GET
THROUGH THIS CHAPTER.

00:55.456 --> 00:59.627
HONEY, YOU'VE BEEN
STUDYING ALL NIGHT.

00:59.627 --> 01:02.396
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BREAK
AND COME WITH US TO THE MOVIE?

01:02.396 --> 01:05.032
I DON'T THINK OUR LITTLE GEORGE
IS GOING ANYWHERE

01:05.032 --> 01:07.635
UNTIL HE'S FINISHED
HIS HOMEWORK.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.139
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A LOT
OF ATTITUDE

01:11.139 --> 01:14.742
FOR SOMEBODY WHOSE REPORT CARD
LOOKS LIKE IT HAS A STUTTER...

01:18.779 --> 01:21.582
D-D-D-D-D-D-D...

01:23.617 --> 01:27.221
DAD, I KNOW I SAID
I'D GO TO COLLEGE IF YOU DO,

01:27.221 --> 01:30.224
BUT WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ADMIT
WE'RE BAD AT SCHOOL?

01:30.224 --> 01:32.092
BECAUSE I DON'T GIVE UP,
OKAY?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.894
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
THINK ABOUT THIS

01:33.894 --> 01:36.897
WHILE YOU'RE AT THE MOVIES--
YOUR DAD IS HOME STUDYING,

01:36.897 --> 01:40.234
ON HIS WAY TO GETTING
HIS FIRST "A" IN COLLEGE.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.205
GEORGE, I HAVE TO SAY

01:44.205 --> 01:46.574
I AM REALLY PROUD
OF THE WAY YOU'RE--

01:46.574 --> 01:49.477
NOT NOW, WOMAN!
I'M FREAKING OUT!

01:52.913 --> 01:54.948
ANGIE, I'VE BEEN
ON THE SAME PAGE

01:54.948 --> 01:57.084
FOR TWO HOURS.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.719
I'M IN OVER MY HEAD.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.355
AND DON'T JUST SAY
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT,

02:01.355 --> 02:03.191
BECAUSE, OKAY, IT'S NOT.

02:03.191 --> 02:06.794
ALL RIGHT. I'M SURE
YOU'LL DO YOUR BEST.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.532
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?

02:14.602 --> 02:17.605
YOU WANT ME TO STAY HOME
AND KEEP YOU COMPANY?

02:17.605 --> 02:19.807
NO. LOOK, I DON'T NEED
ANY MORE DISTRACTIONS, OKAY?

02:19.807 --> 02:20.908
I GOTTA FOCUS.

02:20.908 --> 02:24.678
THEN I WILL GET OUT
OF YOUR HAIR, HMM?

02:24.678 --> 02:26.214
MMM, MMM, MMM.

02:34.522 --> 02:37.658
THAT'S GREAT.
NOW I GOT A STUDY BUDDY.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.066
ELASTICITY IS A FLUCTUATION
OF PRICES

02:46.066 --> 02:48.869
WHEN EITHER SUPPLY
OR DEMAND CHANGES.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.037
IN THIS EXAMPLE,

02:50.037 --> 02:53.207
"Q" IS THE HORIZONTAL,
AND "Y" IS THE VERTICAL.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.276
A COMMON MISTAKE STUDENTS MAKE

02:55.276 --> 02:58.412
IS TO CONFUSE ELASTICITY
WITH SLOPE.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.548
CAN ANYONE TELL ME
THE DIFFERENCE?

03:03.050 --> 03:05.586
MR. LOPEZ?

03:05.586 --> 03:07.555
WHAT, ME? COME ON!
LOOK, WHEN I WANT

03:07.555 --> 03:10.591
TO ANSWER A QUESTION,
I'LL LOOK LIKE THIS KISS-ASS.

03:10.591 --> 03:14.662
"OH, I KNOW, I KNOW!
LOOK AT ME, DESPERATE."

03:14.662 --> 03:19.132
MR. LOPEZ, DO YOU EVEN
UNDERSTAND WHAT ELASTICITY IS?

03:19.132 --> 03:21.068
HUH, OF COURSE I DO.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.136
WHY DO YOU THINK
I WEAR SWEATPANTS

03:23.136 --> 03:25.273
TO THANKSGIVING DINNER?

03:27.441 --> 03:29.943
WHY DON'T WE WRAP IT UP
FOR TONIGHT?

03:29.943 --> 03:31.945
SEE EVERYONE ON WEDNESDAY.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.318
MR. LOPEZ, CAN I HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU?

03:37.318 --> 03:38.986
UH, SURE. BUT LET'S LEAVE
THE DOOR OPEN,

03:38.986 --> 03:42.055
BECAUSE PEOPLE
ARE STARTING TO TALK.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.857
IT'S OBVIOUS
WHAT'S GOING ON.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.394
YOU DON'T GET THE MATERIAL,
SO YOU'RE COVERING WITH HUMOR.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.829
SO YOU ADMIT I'M FUNNY.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.464
THAT'S NOT MY POINT.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.165
THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING,

03:52.165 --> 03:55.002
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PASS
THIS CLASS OR THE MIDTERM.

03:55.002 --> 03:59.807
I HAVE A FEELING I'M GONNA
DO JUST FINE ON THE MIDTERM.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.742
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
ONE OF THOSE IDIOTS

04:01.742 --> 04:05.679
WHO BOUGHT LAST YEAR'S MIDTERM
ONLINE, BECAUSE I CHANGED IT.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.915
DAMN IT!

04:09.850 --> 04:12.185
WAIT, I GET IT NOW.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.854
THE TEST WAS SO CHEAP

04:13.854 --> 04:17.925
BECAUSE OF THE ELASTICITY
OF NOBODY WANTING IT, RIGHT?

04:17.925 --> 04:19.427
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.894
OH, QUE LA...

04:20.894 --> 04:23.797
I THINK THAT'S SPANISH
FOR "YIKES."

04:25.065 --> 04:28.001
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

04:31.872 --> 04:35.242
* ALL MY FRIENDS

04:35.242 --> 04:37.311
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

04:38.912 --> 04:40.280
* THE LOW RIDER

04:40.280 --> 04:43.884
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

04:43.884 --> 04:45.519
* YEAH

04:55.663 --> 04:58.566
WHERE'S MAX?

05:03.637 --> 05:06.474
I WANT TO GIVE HIM BACK
HIS PAINTBALL GUN.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.509
THAT'S TWO WEEKS IN A ROW.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.244
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
TRAINING TO TAKE BACK CUBA?

05:11.244 --> 05:15.015
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
I WANT NAMES.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.552
RELAX, I WAS JUST KIDDING.

05:18.552 --> 05:22.356
OH. WELL, NOW THAT YOU KNOW,

05:22.356 --> 05:26.560
I'VE JOINED A GROUP
OF CUBAN PATRIOTS.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.763
WE CONDUCT MILITARY EXERCISES

05:29.763 --> 05:33.934
AT AN INDOOR PAINTBALL
FACILITY IN TARZANA.

05:37.505 --> 05:41.442
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU
TO TAKE BACK YOUR HOMELAND.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.010
SO TO HELP WITH THE INVASION,

05:43.010 --> 05:46.814
I'M GONNA PITCH IN FOR SOME
BATMAN WALKIE-TALKIES.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.419
VERY FUNNY, HUH?

05:51.419 --> 05:54.555
WE WOULD NEED SIX OF THOSE.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.225
JUST LEAVE THE GUN.
I'LL TELL MAX IT'S HERE.

05:58.225 --> 06:04.565
SO, ARE YOU FINDING COLLEGE
TOUGHER THAN YOU IMAGINED?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.233
IT'S NOTHING I CAN'T HANDLE.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.268
WHY HAVE YOU WRITTEN

06:08.268 --> 06:14.074
"IN SCRAWED"
ALL OVER YOUR NOTES?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.810
IT SAYS, "I'M SCREWED."

06:23.551 --> 06:26.286
COME ON,
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

06:26.286 --> 06:29.256
VIC, I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GET
A BIG KICK OUT OF THIS,

06:29.256 --> 06:30.891
BUT I'M SINKIN', MAN.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.595
I GOT A MIDTERM TOMORROW,
AND I THINK I'M GONNA FAIL.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.097
GEORGE, I MAKE FUN
OF YOU SOMETIMES,

06:37.097 --> 06:39.132
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO FAIL.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.502
AT LEAST TAKE THE TEST

06:41.502 --> 06:44.638
AND GIVE IT TWO MORE DAYS
AFTER THAT.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.741
YOU'RE IN THE POOL,
AREN'T YOU?

06:51.078 --> 06:53.013
JUST FOR TEN BUCKS.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.616
WELL, YOU CAN SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR TEN BUCKS,

06:55.616 --> 06:57.551
BECAUSE I THINK
I'M GONNA QUIT.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.621
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GONNA TELL MY FAMILY.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.790
WELL, YOU HAVE TO DO
WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT.

07:02.790 --> 07:06.159
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
I LEARNED FROM PAINTBALL.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.495
OH.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.797
IF YOU RUN FROM CONFLICT,

07:09.797 --> 07:13.601
YOU WIND UP WITH PURPLE WELTS
ON YOUR BUTTOCKS.

07:18.005 --> 07:21.509
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA TALK TO ANGIE.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.944
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP, VIC.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.278
VERY WELCOME.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.216
AAH!

07:29.216 --> 07:30.518
ANGIE--

07:30.518 --> 07:32.653
HONEY, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.788
WHEN HE GOT HOME
FROM SOCCER PRACTICE,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.624
HE WENT STRAIGHT
TO STUDYING.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.192
ALL THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN
TELLING HIM TO WORK HARD

07:39.192 --> 07:40.661
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,

07:40.661 --> 07:44.732
BUT SEEING YOU STUDY
ACTUALLY GOT THROUGH TO HIM.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.640
SEE THAT?

07:52.640 --> 07:54.775
THAT'S ALL YOU.

07:58.378 --> 08:01.214
I GUESS IT IS.

08:01.214 --> 08:04.552
IT'S LIKE HIS WHOLE FUTURE'S
RIDING ON THE 12 HOURS

08:04.552 --> 08:06.587
BETWEEN NOW
AND TOMORROW'S MIDTERM.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.722
(chuckles)

08:09.990 --> 08:13.226
HONEY, ARE YOU FEELING
A LITTLE PRESSURE?

08:13.226 --> 08:15.796
ANGIE, PLEASE.

08:15.796 --> 08:20.601
(screeches) I GOT THIS!

08:20.601 --> 08:23.937
I'M A LOPEZ.
LOPEZ'S DON'T FEEL PRESSURE.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.807
MAYBE WE GET A LITTLE--
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE SWEATY,

08:26.807 --> 08:31.211
YOU KNOW, CHEST GETS TIGHT,
WE CAN'T BREATHE...

08:31.211 --> 08:35.716
YOU KNOW, HAIR FALLS OUT
IN THE SHOWER...

08:35.716 --> 08:39.219
OKAY, WHEN YOU JOKE LIKE THAT,
I KNOW YOU'RE FINE.

08:39.219 --> 08:43.456
IT'S JUST ONE BIG JOKE, ANGIE.
I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.059
(softly) HELP.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.795
WHAT?

08:47.795 --> 08:53.734
HELP. I CAN'T BREATHE.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.837
OH, STOP JOKING.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.641
YEAH, I'M JOKING.
I'M JUST FINE.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.776
(speaks Spanish)

09:11.952 --> 09:13.887
GOOD LUCK ON THE TEST,
MR. LOPEZ.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.924
YOU DON'T NEED LUCK
WHEN YOU KNOW THE ANSWERS.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.993
I KNOW. AND THAT'S WHY
I SAID, "GOOD LUCK."

09:19.993 --> 09:22.763
WAIT. JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW ONE THING

09:22.763 --> 09:24.431
BEFORE YOU GRADE THESE TESTS.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.834
OKAY, I'M SORRY WE GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT,

09:26.834 --> 09:29.670
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
I WAS MESMERIZED BY YOU

09:29.670 --> 09:32.572
AND ENCAPSULATED
BY YOUR BEAUTY.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.782
NAME--GEORGE LOPEZ.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.752
ONE FOR ONE.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.993
IS THERE A PROBLEM,
MR. LOPEZ?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.535
MOM, YOU ARE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

10:35.535 --> 10:36.970
MY POEM IS GONNA BE PUBLISHED

10:36.970 --> 10:39.206
IN THE "AMERICAN ANTHOLOGY
OF YOUNG WRITERS"!

10:39.206 --> 10:42.776
I'M GONNA BE
A PUBLISHED POET!
THAT'S NICE, HONEY!

10:42.776 --> 10:45.245
MOM, I GOT A "B"
ON MY MATH TEST.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.881
OH, MY GOD--
MAX, THAT'S WONDERFUL!

10:51.218 --> 10:53.020
MOM, YOU DIDN'T
ASK ME THE TITLE.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.989
MY POEM IS CALLED
"INVISIBLE GIRL."

10:55.989 --> 10:58.058
TONIGHT IS YOUR NIGHT.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.962
I'M GONNA MAKE WHATEVER
MY LITTLE OVERACHIEVER WANTS.

11:01.962 --> 11:05.098
YOU KNOW, I GET "B's"
ALL THE TIME. IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.000
YOU KNOW, YOU MAKE
A LOT OF NOISE

11:07.000 --> 11:10.237
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S SUPPOSED
TO BE INVISIBLE.
MAX.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.708
EASY, SPECIAL ED.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.510
DON'T TALK SMACK TO ME
UNTIL YOU CAN MAKE IT

11:17.510 --> 11:20.848
IN A CLASS WHERE YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO USE METAL SCISSORS.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.185
WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT,
"METAL SCISSORS"?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.120
HONEY...

11:32.092 --> 11:35.162
LET'S JUST CELEBRATE
THIS MOMENT, HUH?

11:36.663 --> 11:39.699
CAN WE CALL DAD AT SCHOOL?
I REALLY WANT TO TELL HIM.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.301
OH, HE'S IN CLASS,

11:41.301 --> 11:44.905
BUT MAYBE
THEY'RE ON A BREAK.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.907
GO AHEAD.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.642
DAD? I GOT MY QUIZ BACK.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.544
YOU GOT A "B"?
THAT'S GREAT, MAX.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.346
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

11:53.346 --> 11:56.349
LOOK, I GOTTA GO, OKAY?
THE PROFESSOR'S GONNA GET MAD.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.185
(whack)

11:58.185 --> 12:00.120
FORE!

12:02.155 --> 12:04.925
THAT WAS ONE OF THE STUDENTS
ANSWERING A QUESTION.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.593
I THINK HE GOT IT WRONG.

12:06.593 --> 12:09.496
I THINK THE RIGHT ANSWER
IS FIVE!

12:09.496 --> 12:12.900
WE'RE SITTING WAY IN THE BACK.
GOTTA GO.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.868
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SCREAMING "FORE"?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.469
WE'RE AT A DRIVING RANGE.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.206
I HOOKED IT OVER THE FENCE
INTO THE RETIREMENT VILLAGE.

12:19.206 --> 12:22.742
I'M TRYING TO GIVE THAT
OLD MAN A HEADS-UP.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.046
YOU ALMOST BLEW MY COVER.

12:26.046 --> 12:29.116
DUDE, YOU DROPPED OUT
OF COLLEGE A WEEK AGO.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.118
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA STOP
HIDING FROM YOUR FAMILY

12:31.118 --> 12:34.021
AND TELL 'EM THE TRUTH?
WELL, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

12:34.021 --> 12:35.755
LOOK, I WANTED
TO TELL MAX THE TRUTH,

12:35.755 --> 12:38.391
BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS
LIFE, HE GOT A GOOD GRADE.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.360
THAT'S BECAUSE
HE SAW ME STUDYING.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.996
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
LET HIM DOWN NOW

12:42.996 --> 12:44.865
AND TELL HIM
THAT I'M A QUITTER?

12:44.865 --> 12:47.700
SO YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP LYING
TO MAX, HUH?

12:47.700 --> 12:50.804
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LIE
TO YOUR KIDS TO PROTECT THEM.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.806
"DADDY,
DID MY GOLDFISH DIE?"

12:52.806 --> 12:55.008
"NO, SON. YOU THINK
A DEAD GOLDFISH

12:55.008 --> 12:57.577
COULD SWIM THAT FAST
DOWN A TOILET?"

12:57.577 --> 13:00.213
WELL, IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE THAT WAY, GEORGE.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.449
MY PARENTS NEVER LIED TO ME.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.351
OH, YEAH?

13:04.351 --> 13:07.054
SO YOUR PARENTS NEVER HAD SEX
BEFORE THEY GOT MARRIED?

13:07.054 --> 13:08.755
(speaks Spanish) NO WAY.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.690
YOU KNOW HOW RELIGIOUS
MY MOM IS.

13:10.690 --> 13:13.293
THEY WAITED AND DID IT RIGHT.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.129
DUDE, YOU WERE
IN THE WEDDING PHOTO.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.967
THERE'S A PICTURE OF YOUR MOM

13:19.967 --> 13:22.235
BREAST-FEEDING YOU
AT THE RECEPTION.

13:26.573 --> 13:33.146
CARMEN, I'M REALLY SORRY
I DIDN'T SEEM EXCITED EARLIER.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.415
I AM SO PROUD YOU GOT
A POEM PUBLISHED.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.817
WANT TO HEAR IT?
I'D LOVE TO.

13:41.989 --> 13:46.393
"INVISIBLE GIRL"
BY CARMEN LOPEZ.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.328
(doorbell rings)

13:48.328 --> 13:50.130
OH!

13:50.130 --> 13:54.001
I HAVE TO GET THAT.
THIS WILL JUST TAKE A SECOND.

13:54.001 --> 13:57.570
COME ON, MORMONS.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.476
HI. CAN I HELP YOU?

14:03.476 --> 14:04.912
HI, I'M TRACY LIM.

14:04.912 --> 14:08.381
YOUR HUSBAND WAS
IN MY ECONOMICS CLASS.
OH, COME ON IN.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.650
HI.

14:10.650 --> 14:15.055
I'M SORRY. DID YOU SAY "WAS"
IN YOUR CLASS?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.957
YES, BEFORE HE WAS CALLED UP.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.826
CALLED UP?

14:19.826 --> 14:21.428
YES. HE LEFT ME A MESSAGE

14:21.428 --> 14:23.496
AND SAID HE COULDN'T
COME TO CLASS ANYMORE

14:23.496 --> 14:27.567
BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE RESERVES,
AND HIS UNIT GOT CALLED UP.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.805
MY HUSBAND'S
IN THE RESERVES, TOO,

14:32.805 --> 14:36.309
AND I JUST WANTED TO COME BY
AND SEE HOW YOU WERE DOING.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.445
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

14:44.284 --> 14:48.021
I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.290
CAN YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MINUTE?

14:54.227 --> 14:56.629
WANT TO HEAR A POEM?

14:58.498 --> 15:00.767
OH, HI, HONEY.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.503
YOU'RE HOME LATE
FROM SCHOOL.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.341
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
A COUPLE OF STUDENTS IN CLASS

15:08.341 --> 15:11.478
ARE STRUGGLING, SO I STAYED
BEHIND TO TUTOR 'EM.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.384
WHY ARE YOU
ICING YOUR SHOULDER?

15:17.384 --> 15:19.286
UH, IT'S CALLED
"OOH-OOH SHOULDER."

15:19.286 --> 15:21.221
IT'S AN INJURY
COLLEGE KIDS GET

15:21.221 --> 15:24.257
WHEN THEY KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS,
'CAUSE THEY'RE LIKE THAT--

15:24.257 --> 15:27.394
"OOH, I KNOW IT!"
IT'S DEGENERATIVE.

15:27.394 --> 15:30.497
TRACY, CAN YOU
COME IN HERE A MINUTE?

15:30.497 --> 15:32.899
TRACY? TRACY WHO?

15:32.899 --> 15:34.934
(clears throat)

15:36.869 --> 15:40.273
I GUESS MY SECRET IS OUT.

15:42.542 --> 15:47.280
ANGIE, UH... I HAVEN'T BEEN
GOING TO COLLEGE BECAUSE...

15:47.280 --> 15:50.183
I ENLISTED
IN THE MILITARY.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.156
I STILL LOVE YOU,

15:56.156 --> 15:59.592
BUT I ALSO LOVE A LITTLE LADY
CALLED "AMERICA."

16:03.630 --> 16:05.632
BEFORE YOU MAKE
THIS ANY WORSE,

16:05.632 --> 16:07.667
YOU SHOULD KNOW
PROFESSOR LIM'S HUSBAND

16:07.667 --> 16:11.004
IS ACTUALLY
IN THE MILITARY.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.408
YOU KNOW, NORMALLY
I'D DRAW THIS OUT,

16:15.408 --> 16:17.477
BUT I THINK
THERE'S NO CHANCE

16:17.477 --> 16:20.413
THAT IT'S GONNA GET
ANY BETTER FROM HERE.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.115
MMM.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.950
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:23.950 --> 16:27.120
MY HUSBAND LIED TO YOU.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.156
IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE MARRIED TO HIM,

16:29.156 --> 16:33.293
BUT WITHOUT WHATEVER
THE GOOD STUFF IS.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.395
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL YOU I WAS QUITTING.

16:35.395 --> 16:39.299
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
LOTS OF PEOPLE QUIT.

16:39.299 --> 16:42.535
WHY WOULD YOU LIE AND PRETEND
YOU WERE IN THE RESERVES

16:42.535 --> 16:44.837
WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY
OUT THERE SACRIFICING

16:44.837 --> 16:46.373
AND SERVING OUR COUNTRY?

16:46.373 --> 16:50.177
I WANTED MY $28 BACK?

16:50.177 --> 16:52.679
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GLAD YOU QUIT,

16:52.679 --> 16:55.115
BECAUSE ALL YOU DID
WAS DISRUPT MY CLASS,

16:55.115 --> 16:57.684
AND YOU CAN BET
I WON'T MISS THAT.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.188
WELL, THIS MUST BE
YOUR TEACHER.

17:01.188 --> 17:04.657
I RECOGNIZE THE ANGER
AND DISAPPOINTMENT.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.294
I'M OUT OF HERE.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.896
OH. WHAT AM I DOING?

17:09.896 --> 17:14.334
PLEASE TELL INVISIBLE GIRL
I'M SORRY,

17:14.334 --> 17:19.272
BUT I JUST CAN'T LISTEN TO THAT
DEPRESSING POEM ANYMORE.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.247
DAD, DID YOU
ACTUALLY QUIT COLLEGE?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.384
MAX, SIT DOWN.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.155
YOU DESERVE TO HEAR
THE TRUTH, SON.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.057
I'VE BEEN CALLED UP
BY THE MILITARY.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.933
SO WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
THIS WHOLE TIME

17:46.933 --> 17:50.570
YOU TOLD US YOU
WERE IN SCHOOL?
YOU WANT THE REAL TRUTH?

17:50.570 --> 17:53.740
I WAS AT THE LIBRARY
STUDYING ON MY OWN.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.644
REALLY? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF I OPENED YOUR BAG

17:57.644 --> 17:59.979
AND FOUND A RECEIPT
FROM THE DRIVING RANGE?

17:59.979 --> 18:02.249
I WOULD SAY
THAT OPENING THAT BAG

18:02.249 --> 18:06.085
IS BREAKING THE CIRCLE
OF TRUST WE JUST STARTED...

18:07.787 --> 18:11.258
AFTER MY MOST RECENT
SERIES OF LIES.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.529
GEORGE, HOW COULD YOU LIE
TO US LIKE THAT?

18:16.529 --> 18:18.531
WELL, MAX WAS FINALLY
WORKING HARD,

18:18.531 --> 18:20.567
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO RUIN THAT.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.636
AND YOU KEPT SAYING,
"I'M SO PROUD OF YOU."

18:23.636 --> 18:25.638
ONE TIME
I EVEN CLOSED MY EYES

18:25.638 --> 18:28.575
AND PRETENDED
IT WAS MY MOM SAYING IT.

18:29.976 --> 18:34.214
THEN YOU STARTED NIBBLING
ON MY EAR, AND IT GOT WEIRD.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.585
LOOK, IT WAS JUST EASIER
FOR ME TO LEAVE THE HOUSE

18:38.585 --> 18:41.488
AND LIE THAN IT WAS
TO ADMIT I'M A FAILURE.

18:41.488 --> 18:45.225
HONEY, WITH EVERYTHING
YOU HAVE ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED,

18:45.225 --> 18:48.528
THERE IS NO WAY
YOU COULD BE A FAILURE.

18:48.528 --> 18:53.600
BUT I DO NOT WANT MAX
TO THINK IT'S OKAY TO QUIT.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.004
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.806
I'LL GO TALK TO HIM.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.947
(knocks on door)

19:07.947 --> 19:09.649
HEY, MAX.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.651
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHY I QUIT.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.654
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, DAD.
NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING

19:14.654 --> 19:17.156
TO COLLEGE ANYMORE,
I DON'T HAVE TO GO.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.392
I'M SO GLAD
YOU MESSED THIS UP.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.695
HEY. I DIDN'T MESS IT UP.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.765
WE HAD A DEAL, DAD.
I'M NOT GOING TO COLLEGE.

19:25.765 --> 19:29.469
MAX, LOOK, THE REASON
I QUIT COLLEGE

19:29.469 --> 19:32.705
IS BECAUSE I COULDN'T
DO THE WORK,

19:32.705 --> 19:36.843
AND THAT'S BECAUSE I COULDN'T
DO THE WORK IN HIGH SCHOOL,

19:36.843 --> 19:39.712
AND THAT'S BECAUSE I QUIT TRYING
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.682
BUT YOU STILL DID OKAY.
YEAH, I DID.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.184
LOOK, BUT I WANT YOU
TO DO BETTER.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.086
YOU KNOW WHY PEOPLE
HAVE KIDS, MAX?

19:47.086 --> 19:49.021
SO THEY CAN LIVE THROUGH THEM.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.225
ALL THE THINGS THAT I COULDN'T
DO, YOU WERE GONNA DO FOR ME.

19:52.225 --> 19:55.395
I WANTED YOU TO PLAY
FOR THE DODGERS.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.630
THEN THAT ONE DAY
I SAW YOU HIT THE BALL

19:57.630 --> 19:59.966
AND RUN DIRECTLY
TO THIRD BASE...

20:02.034 --> 20:03.970
I KNEW THAT DREAM WAS DEAD.

20:06.105 --> 20:08.875
FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL,
ROCK STAR--

20:08.875 --> 20:12.245
ONE BY ONE, THEY ALL FELL.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.146
UNTIL ALL THAT'S LEFT NOW,
MAN,

20:14.146 --> 20:16.683
IS FOR YOU TO GO TO COLLEGE.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.117
BUT I'M NOT GOOD AT SCHOOL.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.353
NO, COME ON.
YOU BLEW THAT EXCUSE.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.322
YOU GOT A "B."
HOW DID THAT FEEL?

20:22.322 --> 20:23.890
IT FELT GOOD.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.693
RIGHT? SO FROM NOW ON, WE KNOW
IF YOU GET LESS THAN A "B,"

20:26.693 --> 20:30.297
WE'LL KNOW
YOU'RE NOT TRYING.
THIS ISN'T FAIR.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.732
I BET YOU GOT "D's"
ON YOUR REPORT CARDS.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.368
YEAH, I DID.
SEE, BUT I WAS LUCKY.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.770
I DIDN'T HAVE PARENTS
WHO CARED.

20:37.770 --> 20:41.874
YOU GOT IT BAD 'CAUSE YOU
GOT ALL LOVED AND CHERISHED.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.578
WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT YOU CAN
DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.281
WHEW. IT SUCKS BEING YOU.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.518
SO YOU'D BETTER
CRACK THOSE BOOKS.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.119
WHY ARE YOU TAKING MY GAME?

20:53.119 --> 20:56.323
BECAUSE I HAD A DEADBEAT FATHER
AND AN ABSENTEE MOTHER.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.926
I CAN PLAY ALL
THE VIDEO GAMES I WANT.

20:59.926 --> 21:03.396
I'M HAVING CANDY FOR DINNER
BECAUSE NO ONE CARES.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.337
SURPRISE INSPECTION!

21:12.138 --> 21:14.173
AH.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.343
LOVE YOU. CHERISH YOU.

21:19.111 --> 21:19.612
SWEET. ALL MINE.
