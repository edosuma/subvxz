01:14.570 --> 01:16.220
Hey!

01:16.290 --> 01:18.019
Hey.

01:18.130 --> 01:21.293
Someone's still in bed.

01:23.970 --> 01:29.374
Hey, babe, what if we stay in
for dinner tonight and I cook?

01:29.490 --> 01:31.299
Just the two of us?

01:31.370 --> 01:33.134
Instead of going out?

01:33.210 --> 01:36.100
Yeah, sure. Whatever you want.

01:36.210 --> 01:39.532
- Really?
- That's cool.

01:39.650 --> 01:41.618
I have chicken.

01:43.050 --> 01:44.654
I like chicken.

01:44.890 --> 01:46.779
I'm a chicken man.

02:40.290 --> 02:44.454
Hi, Mom. Oh, how are you?

02:49.490 --> 02:54.052
Mahjong? You don't play Mahjong, do you?

03:00.130 --> 03:02.531
I gotta go.
Let me call you in a little bit.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.015
All right, I love you.

03:04.090 --> 03:05.376
All right. Bye.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.414
Rachel?

03:54.530 --> 03:55.975
Rachel?

03:56.970 --> 03:58.540
Rachel?

03:58.610 --> 04:01.500
Oh, my God. Rachel?

04:01.570 --> 04:03.299
Oh...

04:11.410 --> 04:13.299
...San Francisco private jet to Georgia...

04:40.490 --> 04:42.811
Hey, man, how's it going?

04:42.890 --> 04:44.938
- Joshy called me.
- Is he okay?

04:46.290 --> 04:49.578
Do you remember
when I put the deposit down

04:49.690 --> 04:52.580
on that house in Ojai
for his bachelor party?

04:52.650 --> 04:56.575
Well, I guess the person
that owns the house called, uh, Joshy,

04:56.650 --> 04:59.017
and they were like,
"What are you gonna do?"

04:59.090 --> 05:02.014
- Right.
- So, um... so then he called me.

05:02.090 --> 05:05.731
And was like, "What do you wanna do?"
'cause you can't get the deposit back.

05:05.810 --> 05:11.021
And he's like,
"Well... we have the house."

05:11.090 --> 05:14.219
- Are you gonna go?
- I don't know.

05:18.890 --> 05:20.619
Are you stoned?

05:45.370 --> 05:46.451
Hey!

05:48.610 --> 05:50.055
Hey, man.

05:50.130 --> 05:51.814
How are you?

05:52.770 --> 05:54.340
How are you?

05:54.410 --> 05:56.697
What?

05:56.770 --> 05:58.534
What the fuck was that?

05:59.170 --> 06:00.774
Be careful!

06:17.170 --> 06:19.332
I was saying "How are you?" before.

06:19.410 --> 06:22.095
Yeah, yeah, I know. It just...
it obviously wasn't the best time.

06:22.170 --> 06:23.331
Yeah.

06:26.570 --> 06:27.571
Joshy!

06:38.130 --> 06:39.495
Joshy?

06:45.930 --> 06:47.295
Joshy?

06:58.450 --> 06:59.417
Dude...

07:03.010 --> 07:04.614
Don't touch it.
It's a fucking sniper rifle.

07:04.690 --> 07:08.695
- It's a BB gun. See?
- It's loaded.

07:08.930 --> 07:10.341
Goddamn right it is.

07:17.290 --> 07:21.340
Think about what it would have been like
as a child in 1939 or 1964

07:21.450 --> 07:24.579
to get taken by your parents
to the New York World's Fair, right?

07:24.650 --> 07:28.052
So they take you to, I don't know,
say, the Chilean Pavilion.

07:28.170 --> 07:30.013
And you're smelling
Chilean food for the first time.

07:30.090 --> 07:31.421
You've never even seen it before.

07:31.530 --> 07:33.532
You're seeing people dressed
in traditional Chilean garb...

07:33.610 --> 07:35.692
Hey, guys.

07:35.770 --> 07:39.491
Ari? Adam?

07:39.570 --> 07:40.617
I'm Eric.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.256
- Oh, hey, man.
- Oh, yes, dude.

07:46.330 --> 07:47.855
So funny on the reply alls, man.

07:47.930 --> 07:49.500
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Oh, thanks, man.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.698
I like to set a little tone over email

07:51.770 --> 07:54.057
just to let people know
what kind of bro they're gonna get.

07:54.130 --> 07:57.054
- No, it was hilarious.
- For sure. Tone set.

07:57.130 --> 07:59.178
I don't know if Joshua
gave you any background on me,

07:59.250 --> 08:01.139
but I live with him
in the same housing complex.

08:01.210 --> 08:02.655
Lived with him.

08:02.730 --> 08:05.859
But that's actually what I think
this weekend's gonna be great for.

08:05.930 --> 08:09.332
It's, like, just cleansing the palate.
Keep it light, keep it fun.

08:09.410 --> 08:12.619
Yes, keeping it light,
I think, is paramount.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.533
You brought a bunch
of board games. Awesome.

08:14.610 --> 08:16.692
Yeah, this is kind of the big one
that I'm looking forward to.

08:16.770 --> 08:18.101
"Mecha Dungeon Crawl," have you seen this?

08:18.170 --> 08:19.695
No.

08:19.770 --> 08:21.852
It's a really big, long
complicated co-op game.

08:21.970 --> 08:24.371
That it'll take a couple hours
to go through the directions.

08:24.450 --> 08:27.852
- So it's like "Cranium"?
- No, it's not like "Cranium."

08:27.930 --> 08:29.819
It's a lot more complicated than that.

08:29.930 --> 08:31.170
More like "Apples to Apples"?

08:31.250 --> 08:32.900
No, it's not like that at all either.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.052
We got a portion of time
that will be perfect

08:35.130 --> 08:37.212
for, like, these games.
Like, you and Josh can do that.

08:37.289 --> 08:39.133
- And, like, you and I can...
- Get high?

08:39.210 --> 08:41.258
- Burn it up.
- I have a one-hitter.

08:41.330 --> 08:43.014
Actually, do you guys mind
not doing that in here?

08:43.090 --> 08:45.013
You know, I just wanna
be able to come in here

08:45.090 --> 08:49.493
and get in bed and sleep
and not have ash and detritus

08:49.570 --> 08:50.731
and paraphernalia everywhere.

08:50.810 --> 08:53.131
Okay, no detritus in this room.

08:55.730 --> 08:57.539
I'm a backpack hip-hop kid, you know?

08:57.610 --> 09:00.056
- Oh, of course. Uh-huh.
- J5, Dilated Peoples,

09:00.130 --> 09:02.098
- like, everybody, you know?
- Yeah, I love Tribe Called Quest.

09:02.170 --> 09:04.013
- Stone's Throw.
- Yeah, Stone's Throw is cool.

09:04.090 --> 09:05.535
But I also like T Swift, you know?

09:05.610 --> 09:08.693
- Hey!
- Hey, Joshua!

09:08.810 --> 09:10.380
Hey, Eric. Oh, my God!

09:10.450 --> 09:12.134
Holy shit.

09:12.210 --> 09:15.180
Hey. Hi. I'm Katee.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.173
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming, dude.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.457
- Yeah, yeah, thanks...
- Heard so much about you.

09:19.570 --> 09:21.857
How are you? You okay?

09:21.930 --> 09:23.580
I don't know who you are.
I like hugging you, though.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.732
- I'm Katee.
- So, uh,

09:25.810 --> 09:27.460
are you, like, the property manager here?

09:27.530 --> 09:29.180
- No.
- Of the prop... no, no.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.457
- No, no.
- No, I'm just... I'm Katee.

09:31.530 --> 09:34.818
- Yeah, Katee from Ojai.
- Katee from Ojai.

09:34.890 --> 09:37.018
- Friend from Ojai.
- Just met last night.

09:37.130 --> 09:38.973
Do you wanna hang out?
We're gonna get into a cypher.

09:39.090 --> 09:41.570
- I should probably go.
- Okay.

09:41.690 --> 09:44.739
But you have fun. Have fun.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.938
- I'll walk you to your car.
- Oh.

09:47.010 --> 09:48.694
- Bye.
- I'm so glad I got to see you.

09:51.930 --> 09:54.376
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:59.650 --> 10:01.334
She seemed really cool, man.

10:01.410 --> 10:03.333
- Who, Katee?
- Mm-hmm.

10:03.410 --> 10:06.459
Yeah, she was, she is. She is very cool.

10:06.530 --> 10:08.817
- How did you meet her?
- I got here yesterday.

10:08.890 --> 10:10.415
- Right.
- So I was here before anyone else,

10:10.490 --> 10:13.812
and, I had nothing to do.

10:13.890 --> 10:16.860
- So I went to the bar in town.
- Uh-huh.

10:16.930 --> 10:19.058
And I don't know.
I just, like, was at the bar

10:19.170 --> 10:20.456
and she came up to me, starting chatting,

10:20.530 --> 10:22.498
and it was, like, super easy to talk to.

10:22.570 --> 10:24.413
"It was." She was super easy to talk to.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.174
Good for you, man.
I'm really happy for you.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.252
Well, look, she's cool. She really is.

10:28.370 --> 10:30.691
I mean, we're not gonna
get married or anything, but...

10:34.050 --> 10:35.620
Who else are we gonna be able to celebrate

10:35.730 --> 10:37.459
this sexual victory with?

10:37.530 --> 10:39.771
Yeah, when is everybody else coming?

10:39.970 --> 10:45.101
This... this is actually the crew.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.491
Everybody else kind of flaked.

10:47.570 --> 10:48.731
I know it's only four of us.
Is that weird?

10:48.810 --> 10:50.335
No, no, it's not weird at all.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.181
I think... I think a small crew is cool.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.571
Yeah, we're gonna be like the Beatles.
We are like the Beatles.

10:55.650 --> 10:58.256
- You're like John and Paul.
- I'm Ringo 'cause I keep it light

10:58.330 --> 10:59.616
and I look a little bit like a possum.

10:59.690 --> 11:01.374
And I'm George 'cause I'm stony

11:01.450 --> 11:03.691
and I, you know,
can't get enough of the sun.

11:03.770 --> 11:05.374
I'm, I'm George Martin.

11:05.450 --> 11:07.498
Yeah, the integral fifth Beatle.

11:07.570 --> 11:09.015
I love meeting new people.

11:09.090 --> 11:10.615
This guy's got fucking blow.

11:10.690 --> 11:12.260
You're dropping squirt bombs.

11:12.330 --> 11:14.458
This guy won't get in the pool,
but he will.

11:14.530 --> 11:17.534
- If it's weird, say it 'cause I know...
- It's not weird.

11:27.970 --> 11:29.381
Hey, what are you doing over there, man?

11:29.490 --> 11:31.094
I'm still trying to get the Wi-Fi to work.

11:31.170 --> 11:34.492
Yeah, we're in a cabin in Ojai.
The Wi-Fi's not gonna work.

11:34.570 --> 11:37.574
Yeah, but, I mean, I can't
not be accessible on the Internet

11:37.650 --> 11:39.493
and also up here with
no cell phone reception

11:39.570 --> 11:41.538
- for an entire weekend.
- Who cares? It's the weekend.

11:41.610 --> 11:43.658
When I got off the 101, I called Shauna

11:43.730 --> 11:46.097
and I was like, "Okay, I'm going
where there's no reception. Love you."

11:46.170 --> 11:48.776
Yeah, but I didn't
make that call to Marissa.

11:48.850 --> 11:50.454
So she doesn't know that I'm here

11:50.530 --> 11:52.419
and she doesn't know that I'm unreachable

11:52.490 --> 11:55.061
should she be trying to call
or email me or whatever.

11:55.170 --> 11:56.695
Why doesn't Marissa know that you're here?

11:56.850 --> 12:00.332
She just, you know, decided
that she needed to be somewhere else

12:00.410 --> 12:02.981
that I don't live for the time being.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.372
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, man.

12:06.450 --> 12:07.736
She's just basically coming at me

12:07.810 --> 12:10.416
and saying, you know,
that after 10 years almost,

12:10.530 --> 12:12.817
that there's an entire life
that she feels like she's missing

12:12.890 --> 12:16.497
and that she sort of needed some space,
and I responded to that

12:16.570 --> 12:20.700
by being what I felt was very attentive
and what she felt was clingy.

12:20.770 --> 12:25.173
God, I'm sorry.
It's... That's gotta be really hard.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.139
- Break-ups are tough.
- It's not a break-up,

12:27.210 --> 12:30.020
you know, at this time.

12:30.090 --> 12:31.455
- Okay.
- I think that there might be

12:31.530 --> 12:33.532
some benefit here to having
some friends around.

12:33.610 --> 12:35.339
And maybe, you know,
we're talking about it now

12:35.410 --> 12:37.299
and I'll talk about it with Josh
as soon as I get a chance.

12:37.370 --> 12:42.456
I wouldn't tell Josh about it, I think,
because we're on thin ice here.

12:42.530 --> 12:44.851
There's only four of us. No one showed up.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.171
It's just that he's hurting
and he's been going through a lot

12:47.250 --> 12:48.854
and now I'm hurting, too,

12:48.930 --> 12:50.898
and I feel like we sort of
are going to relate to each other

12:50.970 --> 12:53.132
in a way that I don't expect you to get.

12:53.210 --> 12:56.373
Let's not compare the hurt of a break-up

12:56.450 --> 13:00.341
or whatever it is
with what Joshy went through.

13:00.410 --> 13:04.210
Okay, so everybody gets one
of these character cards.

13:04.290 --> 13:06.213
And I'm now going to go into the attack

13:06.290 --> 13:08.292
and defending portion. You ready?

13:08.370 --> 13:10.338
"Attack abilities and attacking a monster.

13:10.410 --> 13:13.095
The type of symbol shows
whether it is a melee ability

13:13.170 --> 13:14.501
or a ranged attack ability."

13:14.570 --> 13:15.776
Yes. Adam, I have a question.

13:15.890 --> 13:17.380
Is it... okay, I can answer it

13:17.450 --> 13:18.611
because I think I know
what you're going to say.

13:18.690 --> 13:20.294
- What?
- If you're wondering

13:20.370 --> 13:23.533
why the part on the bottom
of your figurine is an octagon

13:23.610 --> 13:26.454
and it's standing on a hexagonal shape
that connects to the center one,

13:26.530 --> 13:27.895
I promise you we're going to get to that

13:27.970 --> 13:29.460
- very, very shortly.
- Was that your question?

13:29.570 --> 13:31.220
That was not my question.
Here's my question.

13:31.290 --> 13:33.816
Should we be playing this game right now?

13:33.890 --> 13:36.052
- Yeah, definitely, 100 percent.
- Yeah.

13:36.130 --> 13:37.575
Can I just pose another option?

13:37.650 --> 13:40.051
We go out tonight,
we go to this bar the Lone Angus.

13:40.130 --> 13:43.020
I've done a bunch of research
on Yelp and Trip Advisor.

13:43.090 --> 13:46.219
It's a fun local bar.
It's, like, divey, but not too divey.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.776
Maybe the time to go to the bar would be,
I don't know, tomorrow afternoon

13:48.850 --> 13:51.091
for happy hour or something,
when, you know, it's light out

13:51.170 --> 13:52.615
and they have the windows open
and the drinks are cheaper.

13:52.690 --> 13:54.897
What's the deal with you
and the windows open at a bar?

13:55.010 --> 13:57.775
It's just nice to get that
bar smell wafting out a little bit.

13:57.890 --> 13:59.574
Okay, let's say we go to the bar tonight,

13:59.650 --> 14:03.257
have some drinks, mellow, nothing crazy.

14:03.330 --> 14:05.981
Come back here, wake up in the morning,

14:06.050 --> 14:07.415
we're sitting around the table,

14:07.490 --> 14:10.175
we are ready to settle in to a full game.

14:10.290 --> 14:11.371
Well, just to be clear,

14:11.450 --> 14:14.977
Adam and I have been
coveting this game for quite some time.

14:15.050 --> 14:18.497
We even actually helped crowd fund it.
We just opened it tonight.

14:18.610 --> 14:21.534
Right, or we could go to the bar,
and if the bar is not cool,

14:21.610 --> 14:23.692
then we could just
come back here and play tonight.

14:23.770 --> 14:26.535
I mean, how fun would that be?
Like a late-night game.

14:26.610 --> 14:30.137
If you're serious about doing it tomorrow,

14:30.210 --> 14:33.896
then, yeah, I mean, the...
it's something to consider, I guess.

14:35.050 --> 14:36.211
So I have a lot planned.

14:36.290 --> 14:38.133
We're gonna do a little dinner tonight,

14:38.210 --> 14:41.054
we're gonna go to the casino,
play a little cards.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.939
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:43.010 --> 14:45.172
Have a bite to eat.
We're not gonna just drink, though.

14:45.290 --> 14:47.497
- We're gonna have a nice dinner.
- Welcome to The Lone Angus.

14:47.570 --> 14:49.220
I will be your waiter. My name is Greg.

14:49.290 --> 14:51.861
- Nice to meet you, Greg.
- Right on.

14:51.970 --> 14:54.621
So I got four tequila shots here

14:54.690 --> 14:58.058
- and a diet coke on the rocks.
- Sweet.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.620
We didn't order those
tequila shots, though,

14:59.690 --> 15:01.419
- so I think we're good.
- Well, that's not what

15:01.490 --> 15:02.571
the bartender is telling me.

15:02.650 --> 15:04.618
It's okay, though. I mean, like, we're...

15:04.690 --> 15:06.340
- Yeah, we'll take them.
- Right, but we didn't order them,

15:06.410 --> 15:08.458
so I don't think
we should have to pay for them.

15:08.530 --> 15:09.611
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

15:09.690 --> 15:12.057
speaking of which,
did you guys order these drinks

15:12.170 --> 15:13.217
that you already have at the bar?

15:13.290 --> 15:14.621
Yes, because you weren't here, so...

15:14.690 --> 15:16.374
Yeah, but there's table service here.

15:16.450 --> 15:18.293
Yeah, but you weren't here.
We waited for 15 minutes.

15:18.370 --> 15:21.055
I was here. I've been here since 5:00.

15:21.130 --> 15:22.620
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I've been here.

15:22.690 --> 15:25.614
It's okay, okay. We'll take the shots.

15:25.690 --> 15:28.296
- ...like every asshole does.
- Oh, we're assholes now?

15:28.370 --> 15:29.576
- Yeah, you're an ass...
- Eric, Eric.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.021
Maybe you could bring me
a windshield wiper

15:31.090 --> 15:33.331
because you just spit
all over my fucking face!

15:33.410 --> 15:34.411
Why don't you take that windshield wiper

15:34.490 --> 15:36.458
and shove it right up your ass?!

15:39.010 --> 15:41.661
- Oh, what's up, man?
- Hey, man, how you doing?

15:41.730 --> 15:43.812
That was great. Hi, guys.

15:43.890 --> 15:45.051
You should see your faces right now.

15:45.130 --> 15:46.939
We just fucking pranked you guys.

15:47.050 --> 15:48.176
That was one of
the best ones we've ever done.

15:48.290 --> 15:50.019
You guys, this is my boy, Greg.

15:50.090 --> 15:51.774
I invited him to join us for the weekend.

15:51.850 --> 15:55.138
This is Josh, this is Ari, this is Adam.

15:55.210 --> 15:56.780
Adam, nice to meet you. Greg.

15:56.850 --> 15:58.420
Ari? Greg.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.175
Josh, the man of the hour. Greg.

16:01.250 --> 16:02.581
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

16:02.650 --> 16:04.414
Thank you guys so much for including me.

16:04.490 --> 16:05.980
- Thank you so much.
- Definitely.

16:06.050 --> 16:07.654
- Not a problem.
- Thank you for...

16:07.770 --> 16:10.171
And my boy here told me
there was a bachelor party,

16:10.250 --> 16:11.979
and I was just like, "Oh, can I come?"

16:12.090 --> 16:13.501
He was like, "You got it."

16:13.570 --> 16:15.379
Yeah, no, I, uh...

16:15.450 --> 16:17.293
it's just that I was gonna get married,

16:17.370 --> 16:20.692
but I'm not anymore, so we're
kind of just salvaging the weekend,

16:20.770 --> 16:23.057
- and it's just for guys.
- Yeah, yeah, we're just,...

16:23.130 --> 16:24.780
we're treating this like a boy's weekend.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.898
I thought you said that
this is a bachelor party.

16:26.970 --> 16:28.051
You're not even getting married?

16:28.130 --> 16:31.498
Well, no, he's... but we're treating it
like the fun of a bachelor party,

16:31.570 --> 16:33.299
but it's just a boy's weekend away.

16:33.370 --> 16:35.941
You know what? Yeah, we're not
even really using that word.

16:36.010 --> 16:38.980
- You guys break up?
- Essentially, I was gonna get married,

16:39.090 --> 16:41.172
- but now it's not gonna happen.
- I just can't stress enough

16:41.250 --> 16:43.218
- that we should just move on.
- It just sort of turned into...

16:43.290 --> 16:45.691
- kind of like a guy's weekend.
- Live right now in the moment.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.101
Hey, man, that's all I'm doing.
That's what all I'm about.

16:47.170 --> 16:49.980
Let's just do our shots to... to nothing.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.575
- Yeah, to nothing.
- To nothing.

16:51.650 --> 16:53.379
- To nothing is a great idea.
- To nothing.

16:53.450 --> 16:55.737
- For the weekend.
- Fuck that bitch.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.017
- She doesn't deserve you.
- Again, not...

16:58.090 --> 16:59.615
- Yeah, maybe.
- So as I mentioned,

16:59.690 --> 17:02.136
I actually invited Greg
to join us for the weekend

17:02.210 --> 17:05.737
as we have that extra room
because this guy brings the party to 11.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.699
Yeah, thanks so much for having me.

17:07.770 --> 17:08.931
Well, you know...

17:09.010 --> 17:10.978
It's so gracious of you guys to include
me on this very special weekend.

17:11.050 --> 17:13.132
I was thinking because
we have fewer people than we thought

17:13.250 --> 17:16.253
that we would kind of spread out
so no one has to share a room,

17:16.329 --> 17:17.934
so we don't actually have
an extra one anymore.

17:18.010 --> 17:21.138
Yeah, and, like, since you guys are boys,

17:21.210 --> 17:23.291
maybe you guys could just share a room.

17:23.369 --> 17:24.734
No, I can't do that.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.494
I can't, uh, I can't room with somebody.

17:27.569 --> 17:30.176
And trust me,
none of you want to room with me

17:30.250 --> 17:32.059
'cause I just got diagnosed
with sleep apnea,

17:32.170 --> 17:34.457
- and I gotta wear that mask.
- Yeah, dude's like Bane.

17:34.530 --> 17:38.012
Hello, would you like your dick sucked?

17:39.810 --> 17:40.857
Yeah.

17:40.930 --> 17:42.420
- Classic Bane joke.
- Terrible Bane.

17:42.530 --> 17:43.941
Let's cheers it up to new beginnings.

17:44.010 --> 17:45.535
- To new beginnings.
- Love it.

17:45.610 --> 17:48.090
- To new beginnings, right?
- Oh, my shit's empty.

17:48.170 --> 17:49.581
- You know, whatever.
- Hey, waiter,

17:49.650 --> 17:50.731
why don't you go get another drink?

17:50.810 --> 17:52.539
Fuck you!

17:54.010 --> 17:55.500
Excuse me, I don't want
to speak to no doctor!

17:55.570 --> 17:58.141
I want to speak to a pharmacist!

17:58.210 --> 17:59.541
Yeah, man.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.533
Oh, goodness.

18:01.610 --> 18:03.260
- Oh, yeah.
- Shockingly cold.

18:03.330 --> 18:05.094
Greg is a trip, huh?

18:05.170 --> 18:07.571
Dude, Greg is the best!

18:07.650 --> 18:09.459
I'm kind of a big fan of him.

18:09.530 --> 18:10.577
- Yeah.
- He's so intense.

18:10.650 --> 18:12.812
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

18:12.890 --> 18:14.221
I'll send it to you. What's your number?

18:14.290 --> 18:15.496
Please do.

18:15.570 --> 18:16.731
Are you cool?

18:18.210 --> 18:19.496
Yeah.

18:22.330 --> 18:24.651
Oh, yeah. I'm great, how are you?

18:24.730 --> 18:26.220
I'm good, I'm good.

18:26.290 --> 18:28.975
I mean, I just wanna make sure
that... that you're good

18:29.050 --> 18:33.180
with all of... with all of
how everything is going.

18:33.290 --> 18:34.735
Yeah, yeah, no.

18:34.810 --> 18:36.858
This is lining up to be a fun one.

18:36.930 --> 18:39.376
It was just, like,
scurrying all around the floor,

18:39.450 --> 18:42.135
and we had, like,
an English muffin we didn't want to...

18:42.250 --> 18:43.740
You know, turtles are,
like, an aphrodisiac.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.773
You wanted to eat the turtle?

18:45.850 --> 18:47.500
In retrospect,
you could've just picked it up

18:47.570 --> 18:51.017
by the little shell on the sides
and been completely okay.

18:51.090 --> 18:52.535
My buddy will pick you up...

18:52.610 --> 18:55.932
...backlogs of nonsense
that go back two years.

18:56.010 --> 19:00.060
Right, but why is this the time
to be bringing any...

19:00.130 --> 19:03.373
But wh... but it just...
it's not even relevant

19:03.450 --> 19:04.940
to what we're talking about anymore.

19:05.010 --> 19:08.093
It's not a part of what
I'm trying to discuss,

19:08.170 --> 19:09.660
and to say that it's something
that I've been

19:09.730 --> 19:13.451
willingly or intentionally
neglecting is insane.

19:13.530 --> 19:14.941
I'm happy you guys are here.

19:15.010 --> 19:17.854
- Are you kidding? Yes.
- I think we're being followed.

19:17.930 --> 19:19.932
No. I'm sorry.

19:20.010 --> 19:22.934
- I'm looking...
- What is happening?

19:23.010 --> 19:24.614
Who are you? Are you okay?

19:24.690 --> 19:27.500
Yeah, I'm looking for my phone.

19:27.570 --> 19:28.901
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

19:29.010 --> 19:30.421
Did you guys see a phone?

19:30.490 --> 19:32.936
- Did it have a case?
- No.

19:34.010 --> 19:35.899
Caseless. I haven't seen it.

19:35.970 --> 19:38.416
I'm sorry, this is Josh.

19:38.490 --> 19:40.094
- Oh, hi, Josh.
- Oh, yeah, I'm Josh.

19:40.170 --> 19:41.331
- I'm Jodi. Hi.
- Hey, Jodi.

19:41.410 --> 19:43.094
- I'm Ari.
- Hi, Ari.

19:43.170 --> 19:44.217
How's it going?

19:44.290 --> 19:45.257
Oh, do you want me to hold that for you?

19:45.330 --> 19:46.456
Yes, please. Yes, please.

19:46.570 --> 19:48.254
- Can I hold it in my lungs?
- Yes, please.

19:48.330 --> 19:50.731
You are cold.

19:50.810 --> 19:52.653
- You need a...
- How can you tell?

19:52.730 --> 19:54.220
Maybe...

19:56.690 --> 19:59.011
- I'm gonna give you my sweater.
- Oh, well, thank you.

19:59.090 --> 20:01.900
- You're such a gentleman.
- Oh, here.

20:01.970 --> 20:03.301
- Have two.
- Thank you. No, I don't need it.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.974
- No, have two.
- Don't please.

20:05.090 --> 20:07.696
Look what's happening. Double the warmth.

20:07.770 --> 20:10.376
Double gentleman attack!

20:10.450 --> 20:12.373
- What?
- I'm sorry.

20:12.450 --> 20:14.452
Are you guys murderers or what?

20:14.530 --> 20:16.737
No, not at all. We are not murderers.

20:16.850 --> 20:18.978
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here in Ojai?

20:19.050 --> 20:20.734
Yeah, what brings you here? Are you local?

20:20.810 --> 20:23.017
I'm here for, like, a big
birthday vacation weekend.

20:23.090 --> 20:25.661
- I'm turning 30.
- Wow, awesome!

20:25.730 --> 20:27.619
- You're with friends?
- Yeah.

20:27.690 --> 20:29.294
- Okay, cool.
- They're not cool right now.

20:29.370 --> 20:31.372
They're real... they're real shitty.

20:31.490 --> 20:35.461
Well, we're having sort of a weird...
not weird, but, like, a party thing.

20:35.530 --> 20:36.861
Nothing like a weird party thing.

20:36.930 --> 20:38.978
I think all party things
are kind of weird.

20:39.050 --> 20:40.017
- Hello.
- Well, hello.

20:40.090 --> 20:41.455
- Hey, this is...
- Hi.

20:41.530 --> 20:43.498
Did someone say "weird party thing"?

20:43.570 --> 20:46.016
Hello, my name is Adam.

20:46.130 --> 20:48.701
My name is Jodi.

20:48.770 --> 20:50.135
We are all robots.

20:50.210 --> 20:55.250
Well, I'm single now, so, you know, um...

20:55.330 --> 20:57.617
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Adam, really?

20:57.690 --> 20:59.613
- What?
- Are you okay?

20:59.690 --> 21:01.852
Well, I got a couple bars,
so I made a phone call.

21:01.930 --> 21:04.297
I'm sorry to drag you into my business.

21:04.370 --> 21:05.576
No, I actually am into it.

21:05.730 --> 21:06.970
Yeah, 10 years of my life
just went down the shitter.

21:07.050 --> 21:09.018
- We talked about this.
- No, man.

21:09.090 --> 21:10.455
- We talked about that.
- Yeah, but everything's changed now.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.095
It's all different. It sucks now.

21:12.170 --> 21:15.333
- Everything's worse.
- So you and Marissa, no?

21:15.450 --> 21:17.657
Yeah, no, no go.
You know, 10 years right in the shitter.

21:17.730 --> 21:19.573
It's fine, but, hey, on the other hand,

21:19.650 --> 21:23.052
Eric has found some casino near here
that he says is the best in the area.

21:23.130 --> 21:24.461
Well, that sounds fun.
I would go to a casino.

21:24.530 --> 21:25.611
There's a casino here?

21:25.730 --> 21:27.573
Didn't expect you guys
to actually be so excited about that.

21:27.650 --> 21:29.334
You look so cold and stupid, both of you.

21:29.410 --> 21:31.697
Do they look like murderers, though?

21:31.770 --> 21:33.818
- Yeah.
- Here, I don't need this.

21:33.890 --> 21:36.018
Thank you very much.
I don't need both, yeah.

21:36.090 --> 21:37.899
Total enthusiasm for Eric's casino idea?

21:37.970 --> 21:40.018
No one just kind of thought
we were gonna go home after this

21:40.090 --> 21:42.536
and, you know, have bedtime and...

21:42.610 --> 21:45.011
- Have bedtime?
- Hey, Adam, is this...

21:45.090 --> 21:47.218
Well, what do you call it
when it's time to go to bed?

21:47.290 --> 21:50.373
- The time I go to bed.
- Are you okay?

21:50.450 --> 21:53.056
Yeah, I mean, you know,
of course not, but...

21:53.130 --> 21:54.700
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

21:54.770 --> 21:57.057
I didn't mean to come out here
and just blurt, I mean...

21:57.130 --> 21:58.859
- No, no, that's big. That's huge.
- I just got off the phone.

21:58.930 --> 22:00.659
And looked over and I saw

22:00.770 --> 22:02.579
Eric and what's-his-name
and you guys over here,

22:02.650 --> 22:05.540
and I just kind of felt like
I had to say something to somebody,

22:05.610 --> 22:07.214
but I shouldn't have. I...

22:07.290 --> 22:09.941
Well, look, if you need
to talk about it, you can.

22:12.770 --> 22:14.374
- No, I'm good, thank you.
- Are you sure?

22:14.450 --> 22:15.895
- Yes.
- I could go like that.

22:16.010 --> 22:18.058
That does feel warmer, but I'm actually...

22:18.130 --> 22:19.655
And your arms are weirdly heavy.

22:19.730 --> 22:22.654
I'm a big, thick kind of oxey Jew.

22:22.730 --> 22:25.336
You kind of are.
You look like someone's cousin

22:25.410 --> 22:28.778
or, like, a boy from camp
who was, like, my crush.

22:28.850 --> 22:30.136
Oh, what camp did you go to?

22:30.210 --> 22:31.496
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:31.610 --> 22:33.419
Well, 'cause I went to camp
back East, so I...

22:33.530 --> 22:35.339
- Me, too.
- Where?

22:35.410 --> 22:37.811
- Blue Star.
- Shut up.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.415
I went to Blue Star.

22:39.490 --> 22:41.811
- You shut up now.
- No, you shut up now.

22:41.890 --> 22:44.097
- Prove it.
- Blue Star where the Jews are.

22:45.090 --> 22:46.251
Yeah.

22:48.090 --> 22:50.377
- Hey!
- Oh, damn it!

22:50.450 --> 22:52.100
Oh, snaps.

22:52.170 --> 22:54.571
Guys, we're gonna go to the casino.
Do you wanna come?

22:54.650 --> 22:56.015
- Me?
- Yeah, you should come.

22:56.090 --> 22:57.979
- Yeah, we need a Lady Luck.
- The more the merrier.

22:58.050 --> 23:00.178
I'll be your Lady Luck.

23:00.290 --> 23:02.372
But I really wanna find my phone.

23:02.490 --> 23:04.458
And I'm actually kind of feeling like
I left it in my house.

23:04.530 --> 23:06.612
Like, I did not even
bring it here to begin with

23:06.730 --> 23:08.459
'cause I'm chill and I wanna unplug.

23:08.530 --> 23:10.851
Yeah, of course. Get out of the Matrix.

23:10.930 --> 23:14.059
Do you think you would walk me down
just to see if it's there?

23:14.170 --> 23:15.376
I don't actually wanna get murdered.

23:15.450 --> 23:17.100
Yeah, well, I would love to,

23:17.170 --> 23:20.652
but Joshy's actually,
um, like, used to come up here as a kid.

23:20.730 --> 23:21.936
- He knows the area pretty well.
- We'll go to the casino.

23:22.010 --> 23:24.217
You come meet us later, right?

23:24.330 --> 23:27.095
- You, too.
- No, I will gladly walk you home.

23:29.410 --> 23:30.650
Did you ever hear about

23:30.730 --> 23:34.257
when there was a pyramid of tampons
that got set on fire

23:34.330 --> 23:36.412
and then pushed down
into the middle of the lake?

23:36.490 --> 23:37.855
Shut up. That was you?

23:37.970 --> 23:39.813
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

23:39.930 --> 23:41.898
That thing, like,
almost burned down a couple of boats.

23:41.970 --> 23:45.611
And it stunk
because it was like a chemical fire!

23:45.690 --> 23:48.341
Like, what are the odds
that you as a child

23:48.410 --> 23:50.139
saw the same things that I saw as a child?

23:50.210 --> 23:52.736
Actual same summers?

23:52.810 --> 23:54.778
No, it's crazy. Similar summers.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.660
- Yeah. Same lake.
- Similar summers.

23:57.730 --> 24:01.860
Tonie, Tonie, Tonie

24:01.930 --> 24:04.774
T-O-N-I-E, why do you spell it
like that, baby?

24:04.850 --> 24:05.897
Tonie!

24:05.970 --> 24:07.893
Tonie, positive vibes, positive energy.

24:07.970 --> 24:10.701
- I should be careful.
- Adam, look at this.

24:10.770 --> 24:12.101
You got exactly what you wanted.

24:12.210 --> 24:13.780
We're all sitting around
playing a game together.

24:13.850 --> 24:15.852
I wanted to play, like, a co-op game

24:15.930 --> 24:18.217
that we could all sort of
just work together as friends.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.735
But we are playing together.

24:19.810 --> 24:23.371
We're all cooperating together
against Tonie here.

24:23.450 --> 24:24.861
It just kind of feels to me like...

24:24.930 --> 24:26.500
like a little bit of
a monkey's paw at this point.

24:26.570 --> 24:28.334
What does that mean, monkey's paw?

24:28.410 --> 24:31.300
Well, like, I wished we were all
playing a game, and now I got my wish,

24:31.370 --> 24:34.101
but it's like the saddest,
weirdest, worst version of that

24:34.210 --> 24:36.178
because I'm just losing money
and I'm stressed out.

24:36.250 --> 24:38.730
So it's like if you went
to a monkey seller

24:38.810 --> 24:40.812
and you said, "Hey, give me a monkey,"

24:40.930 --> 24:42.773
and then he just gave you the hand?

24:42.850 --> 24:44.978
No, I mean, I think
you're thinking of it too literally.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.018
- The hand is cursed.
- Like a leprechaun.

24:47.090 --> 24:49.536
You know, you get them,
and then they fucking...

24:49.610 --> 24:51.180
- they're kind of shady.
- I thought they were shady

24:51.290 --> 24:52.655
before you caught 'em,
but once you caught 'em,

24:52.730 --> 24:53.697
they were, like, your slave.

24:53.770 --> 24:56.171
Well, ta-da.

24:56.250 --> 24:59.094
This is actually... this is amazing.

24:59.170 --> 25:01.252
- Yeah.
- You should see the place I'm staying.

25:01.330 --> 25:04.379
It's like a... a turquoise dealership.

25:05.490 --> 25:07.413
It's like a kidnapper shack.

25:07.490 --> 25:08.980
Yeah, oh, very much so.

25:09.050 --> 25:12.975
Yeah, I'm imagining like the sock
that a teenage boy uses to, like,

25:13.050 --> 25:15.098
- jerk into made into, somehow, a house.
- Jerk off into?

25:15.170 --> 25:17.980
That is pretty... pretty accurate.

25:19.690 --> 25:24.776
Thanks for the, um, walk back here.

25:24.850 --> 25:26.932
It was very nice.

25:27.010 --> 25:29.012
No, thank you. It was, um,

25:29.090 --> 25:32.811
so weird to meet someone from Blue Star.

25:32.890 --> 25:34.096
- I know.
- It's so crazy.

25:34.210 --> 25:37.419
Yeah. You know me.

25:37.490 --> 25:40.539
I'm gonna go inside,
but I'll give you this.

25:40.610 --> 25:42.851
- Oh.
- 'Cause I'm not a thief

25:42.930 --> 25:45.456
even though I probably seem
really rough and tough,

25:45.530 --> 25:48.010
I'm not a thief
and I'm not gonna steal your sweater.

25:58.650 --> 26:01.699
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

26:01.770 --> 26:03.693
- Thank you.
- Yeah. No, thank you.

26:07.010 --> 26:08.899
Are you waiting there for me to get in?

26:08.970 --> 26:10.734
Hmm? Yeah, I don't wanna
leave till you get in.

26:10.810 --> 26:12.494
That's so nice.

26:12.570 --> 26:13.981
That's what you do.

26:18.530 --> 26:19.611
I...

26:19.690 --> 26:23.137
I don't have a key.

26:23.210 --> 26:25.736
Sorry, I forgot.

26:25.810 --> 26:28.654
I smoked your weed, my fault.

26:28.730 --> 26:30.141
- Okay.
- I didn't think about

26:30.210 --> 26:31.291
- whether or not I had a key.
- Okay.

26:31.370 --> 26:32.701
And I feel really embarrassed.

26:32.810 --> 26:35.051
Like, oh, some girl I met in a bar.

26:35.130 --> 26:37.258
- Come on, let's go back to the bar.
- But I don't have my phone,

26:37.330 --> 26:39.492
- and I don't have my purse.
- We're gonna go back to the bar.

26:39.570 --> 26:41.254
There's a lot of things to be embarrassed.

26:44.050 --> 26:46.735
Drums into space...

26:46.810 --> 26:51.452
Dude, this guy used to fucking go
to the parking lots at Dead show...

26:51.530 --> 26:54.136
- I fucking did, man.
- ...and fucking run drum circles.

26:54.210 --> 26:55.860
Dude, I ran drum circles.

26:55.930 --> 26:58.297
I sold acid for, like, five minutes,

26:58.370 --> 26:59.974
and then I got freaked out and I stopped.

27:00.050 --> 27:02.860
I saw the last Grateful Dead show.

27:02.930 --> 27:05.774
I saw the last one they did
at the Meadowlands.

27:05.850 --> 27:08.330
You were not at the last show.
I was at the last show.

27:08.410 --> 27:10.458
Don't try and hitch onto my thing, okay?

27:10.530 --> 27:12.339
- That's not cool.
- Joshua?

27:12.410 --> 27:14.890
Joshua, you seem kind of
down and gloomy doomy.

27:14.970 --> 27:16.654
- No, no.
- Are you sure?

27:16.770 --> 27:19.137
- Yeah, I'm good.
- 'Cause I got the solution.

27:19.210 --> 27:21.338
And it's more cow bell.

27:21.970 --> 27:23.574
- What did you do?
- It's called dramarama,

27:23.650 --> 27:25.254
but ours is fake and it was, like...

27:25.330 --> 27:29.051
it was the first day
of my period and I had a heavy flow.

27:29.130 --> 27:31.292
And I put my pad in the trash
at my friend's house,

27:31.410 --> 27:34.459
but then her French poodle
took the pad out of the trash

27:34.530 --> 27:38.774
and her hot brother saw that, like,
my pussy bleeds or whatever.

27:38.850 --> 27:41.296
- And it was just, like...
- It was like Penthouse letters

27:41.370 --> 27:44.101
- for chicks who get their period.
- What's Penthouse letters?

27:44.170 --> 27:46.571
Oh, my God.

27:46.650 --> 27:48.254
Hello?

27:49.490 --> 27:52.096
It's super Twin Peaksy,

27:52.170 --> 27:56.653
and I fucking hope
my shitty friends took my purse.

27:56.770 --> 27:59.740
Well, I don't know what you're doing now,

27:59.810 --> 28:01.414
But you can come hang out
with my shitty friends.

28:01.490 --> 28:03.857
Yeah, I'll hang out
with your shitty friends.

28:03.930 --> 28:05.739
- Like, do they suck?
- Oh, yeah, they suck so bad.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.653
- Cool.
- Yeah, you will hate them.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.772
And they're all going through
some real hardcore emotional shit.

28:09.850 --> 28:11.375
- Oh. [Chuckles]
- So it'll be a good hang.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.060
How could I resist?

28:13.130 --> 28:16.452
You have been convicted of the crime

28:16.530 --> 28:19.739
of stealing a loaf of bread!

28:19.810 --> 28:21.096
No, no, please!

28:21.210 --> 28:23.975
You've already burned down
my jewelry store!

28:26.450 --> 28:29.340
Oh, God! Holy shit!

28:29.450 --> 28:31.851
Ow! God, that hurt!

28:33.090 --> 28:34.330
Oh, but it was so good. It was so funny.

28:34.450 --> 28:36.930
Hey, it's the girl from the bar!

28:37.010 --> 28:38.455
- Hey!
- Jodi.

28:38.530 --> 28:39.941
- Hi.
- Hi, Jodi. I'm Eric.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.774
- Jodi?
- Hey.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.500
- Do you spell it J-O-D-I?
- You okay?

28:43.570 --> 28:46.141
Here. For that, let me kiss you

28:46.210 --> 28:48.975
- like the Europeans say hello.
- Okay, okay.

28:49.050 --> 28:51.621
- No, I'm just gonna say hello...
- You are saying hello.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.692
- You are saying hello, all right?
- Oh, okay.

28:53.770 --> 28:55.898
- Hi, hi.
- I get it, I get it, okay.

28:55.970 --> 28:57.938
- You wanna smoke weed? It's right here.
- Yes, thank you.

28:58.010 --> 29:00.456
Very unsettling.
He's pointing a gun at me.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.259
- I don't want that.
- It's a BB gun!

29:02.330 --> 29:04.697
Oh, same thing. It's always weird.

29:04.770 --> 29:06.898
Josh, we have some guests now.

29:06.970 --> 29:09.291
You still seem a little boo-boo-boo-boo.

29:09.370 --> 29:11.737
- I'm fine.
- Here, can I make a suggestion?

29:11.810 --> 29:14.131
Oh, well, how are we
stepping it up, kemosabe?

29:14.210 --> 29:16.019
The G-rock over here is gonna shoot me...

29:16.090 --> 29:19.173
- In the dick!
- Oh, yes!

29:19.250 --> 29:21.617
Yes, he's gonna shoot me in the dick hole.

29:21.730 --> 29:23.175
I'm gonna hold the cup on top of my head,

29:23.250 --> 29:25.139
but then he's gotta shoot me

29:25.210 --> 29:28.214
- straight in my dinger.
- Okay, all right!

29:28.290 --> 29:29.416
You really want me to do that?

29:29.570 --> 29:31.334
And if... if the cup falls,

29:31.410 --> 29:33.458
then he gets to shoot me
in my bonanza hole.

29:34.570 --> 29:36.220
The bonanza hole?

29:36.290 --> 29:38.258
You know what I think
a butt hole looks like?

29:38.370 --> 29:40.657
Is it just... I think it looks like
a chimp victim's eye.

29:40.730 --> 29:44.621
Joshua, could I have a little Harry
Carey play-by-play commentary, please?

29:44.690 --> 29:46.101
Oh, perfect. That's great, that's great.

29:46.250 --> 29:51.051
Well, I was just thinking
a year ago, we were all here...

29:51.130 --> 29:54.259
...here with our ladies.

29:54.330 --> 29:58.494
You know, uh, Marissa and Shauna and...

30:00.250 --> 30:01.536
...Rachel.

30:03.770 --> 30:08.253
It's interesting that, I don't know.
I was just thinking about that.

30:09.450 --> 30:11.498
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I'm sorry.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.772
Josh, Josh, Josh, look at me.

30:13.850 --> 30:15.500
It's not okay.

30:16.970 --> 30:19.132
It's not okay to be sad!

30:19.210 --> 30:20.780
You understand?

30:20.850 --> 30:24.138
You are meant to be happy.
That is who you are.

30:24.250 --> 30:27.220
This sad person, that is something

30:27.290 --> 30:29.861
that you think that you are,
but you're not that!

30:29.930 --> 30:34.572
If you were meant to be sad,
being sad would feel good.

30:34.650 --> 30:37.176
But it doesn't, does it? What feels good?

30:37.250 --> 30:38.775
Being happy!

30:38.890 --> 30:42.337
And you should feel good, so be happy!

30:42.410 --> 30:44.219
Be who you are.

30:46.770 --> 30:48.772
- Sorry. I...
- No, no, no, no.

30:48.850 --> 30:50.215
- I didn't mean to...
- No, no, no.

30:50.290 --> 30:54.659
Look, you're not allowed to apologize

30:54.730 --> 30:57.097
the rest of the time that I'm here.

31:01.490 --> 31:03.652
Thank you for that, Greg.

31:03.730 --> 31:05.061
Yes, Greg! Good pep talk!

31:05.130 --> 31:08.020
How about, Joshua,
that we create some new memories?

31:08.090 --> 31:09.455
- What do you mean?
- Joshua,

31:09.530 --> 31:11.498
I'm about to get shot
in my dick hole for you.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.652
So please just give me
a little commentary.

31:13.730 --> 31:16.415
- Do Harry Carey.
- Greg,

31:16.490 --> 31:20.211
now lining up his... his rifle.

31:20.290 --> 31:23.851
He's got it lined up
to shoot Eric in the penis.

31:23.930 --> 31:26.137
If the red cup falls,

31:26.210 --> 31:29.100
Eric's gotta get shot in the bonanza hole.

31:30.050 --> 31:33.497
Right where the chimp victim's eye is.

31:33.610 --> 31:35.977
That's beautiful! Oh, my God!

31:42.210 --> 31:46.340
Oh, my God! It didn't go in my D-hole,
but it clipped my yam sack!

31:46.410 --> 31:47.741
Oh, my God, you clipped his sack!

31:47.810 --> 31:49.494
A fucking bet is a bet.

31:49.570 --> 31:51.174
The cup fell,

31:51.250 --> 31:52.775
So it looks like
you're gonna be shooting me

31:52.850 --> 31:56.138
- right in my fucking bonanza.
- No, no, no!

31:56.210 --> 31:58.019
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

31:58.090 --> 32:00.491
- Rules are rules.
- You know, maybe...

32:00.570 --> 32:03.540
I mean, do you
really wanna be shot in the bonanza?

32:03.610 --> 32:06.580
Maybe we could do something
that everyone is involved with.

32:06.650 --> 32:08.459
Like, you know,
with six of us, we could just get

32:08.530 --> 32:10.498
a short campaign going
of Mecha Dungeon Crawl.

32:10.570 --> 32:14.939
Mecca? Mecca Dungeon Cr...
like, this is Islamic?

32:15.010 --> 32:18.617
- No, it's, like, mechanical.
- It's a very complicated board game.

32:18.690 --> 32:19.737
We could just play through it quickly

32:19.810 --> 32:21.653
and with so many people,
it would go pretty fast.

32:21.730 --> 32:22.891
I think that it's bad for me

32:23.010 --> 32:24.853
to play a game that's
very complicated right now

32:24.930 --> 32:27.740
because I smoked tons of...
ripped so much.

32:27.810 --> 32:30.814
I had a bong and I feel like
it's not my preference to play a game.

32:30.890 --> 32:34.531
And I'm not gonna be able
to get there with you.

32:34.610 --> 32:36.772
We could play the very,
very complicated game

32:36.850 --> 32:38.614
that could last six to seven hours

32:38.690 --> 32:41.660
with a couple of strangers
who are all fucked up on pot,

32:41.730 --> 32:45.098
or we could go into the hot tub.

32:45.170 --> 32:46.410
I'll go in the hot tub!

32:46.490 --> 32:48.413
The lady wants the hot tub.

32:48.490 --> 32:50.015
- Hot tub.
- The gentleman wants a hot tub.

32:50.090 --> 32:52.457
- Joshy?
- Yeah, well...

32:52.530 --> 32:54.897
Great. Hot tub time.
Here, I'll just take this from you.

32:54.970 --> 32:56.859
Yeah, take it. I don't want it.

32:56.930 --> 32:59.900
- All right, man.
- We're ready for bubbles.

32:59.970 --> 33:02.576
- Oh! Okay.
- Gee, man.

33:02.650 --> 33:03.651
Oh, my God.

33:03.730 --> 33:04.891
There's a slight problem with the hot tub.

33:04.970 --> 33:06.813
It is not currently hot.

33:06.890 --> 33:09.370
- Oh.
- There's steam coming out of it.

33:09.450 --> 33:11.418
Well, that's just because
the water is warmer than the air.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.572
All right, well,
let's fucking party inside.

33:13.650 --> 33:16.972
Not so fast. Got a satellite view
of the entire neighborhood here.

33:17.090 --> 33:18.933
Found the appropriate neighbors' hot tubs,

33:19.050 --> 33:21.656
and I think I found our spot right here.

33:21.730 --> 33:23.459
Are you talking about to sneak in?

33:23.530 --> 33:24.941
Yes, we're gonna do a little sneaking.

33:25.010 --> 33:26.739
And we're gonna do a little dip,

33:26.850 --> 33:28.614
- then we'll do a little dash.
- And it's perfect too.

33:28.690 --> 33:30.499
It's perfect 'cause
there's none of those security stickers

33:30.570 --> 33:33.494
on any of the gates, so we'll get in fine.

33:33.570 --> 33:35.698
- Oh, ho!
- I say let's do it, man.

33:35.770 --> 33:38.011
Ojai is communal hot tubs.
My hot tub is your hot tub.

33:39.450 --> 33:41.100
To the hot tub!

33:41.170 --> 33:43.935
Oh, okay, we're going right now.

34:09.690 --> 34:12.534
- Adam, don't you wanna come in?
- No, it's not my thing.

34:12.610 --> 34:14.498
You just snuck in to sit here?

34:14.570 --> 34:16.732
Yeah, well,
I wanna be around people to hang out.

34:16.810 --> 34:18.812
But, you know, I'll let them have
their fun. It's not really for me.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.255
I'm sorry I didn't wanna do your game.

34:20.330 --> 34:22.297
That's fine.
You know, no one wants to do it,

34:22.370 --> 34:24.020
so, it's, you know,
you're just part of the gang.

34:24.090 --> 34:26.775
Yeah, well, I know I'm a stranger

34:26.850 --> 34:29.251
who's, like, on drugs and drunk
and doesn't have any pants on,

34:29.370 --> 34:31.532
but I'm wishing you the best.

34:31.610 --> 34:33.179
- I hope you're okay.
- I guess you're the first

34:33.290 --> 34:35.257
of many new
pantsless women I will soon meet.

34:35.330 --> 34:38.413
- Hey, Jodi?
- Sure. Yeah.

34:38.489 --> 34:40.333
- No, it's okay. I know you wanna go in.
- I'm sorry.

34:40.409 --> 34:43.619
You know, I do have,
like, some okay friends.

34:43.690 --> 34:46.739
I have a friend that I could introduce
you to tomorrow if you're interested.

34:46.810 --> 34:48.777
She's nice and fun.

34:48.889 --> 34:50.699
She's not that nice, but she's pretty fun.

34:50.770 --> 34:54.013
Yeah? Does she like desperate,
broken men with nothing to offer?

34:54.090 --> 34:56.092
Most American women
like that kind of thing.

34:56.170 --> 34:58.059
- Welcome to the hot tub.
- Oh!

34:58.170 --> 35:00.252
Welcome to the hot tub, Jodi!

35:00.330 --> 35:04.460
Jodi's in the tub

35:04.570 --> 35:06.220
Jodi's in the hot tub...

35:08.050 --> 35:10.212
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You guys hear that?

35:10.290 --> 35:11.940
What? Oh, it's probably the Fondas.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.421
They wanna join us in the tub.

35:13.490 --> 35:14.980
- Hey, Jodi?
- What?

35:15.050 --> 35:17.417
Do you have any words about
joining the Greater Tub Community?

35:17.490 --> 35:20.733
Cool, fun, new, a surprise.

35:20.810 --> 35:22.619
Tonight, the evening.

35:22.690 --> 35:25.091
I love it, strangers, scared.

35:25.170 --> 35:29.255
- I'm really happy.
- Yay, with friends!

35:29.330 --> 35:32.061
Adam, let's play
your board game in the hot tub.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.495
Well, that's obviously impossible.

35:33.570 --> 35:35.174
Hey, Adam, come in here, man.

35:35.250 --> 35:38.538
- Adam.
- Adam, come on, buddy.

35:38.610 --> 35:39.691
- He doesn't want to.
- Ari? Ari?

35:39.770 --> 35:41.898
Yeah?

35:41.970 --> 35:45.338
My sister's beautiful,
and she's a dental hygienist,

35:45.410 --> 35:47.094
so she has her own money.

35:47.170 --> 35:49.537
That's great.

35:49.610 --> 35:51.419
Wait, why did you say that?

35:54.530 --> 35:55.941
You guys heard that, right?

35:56.010 --> 35:58.251
Did you guys...
am I the only one who heard that?

35:58.330 --> 35:59.741
- I did hear that.
- It's probably, like, the fucking...

35:59.810 --> 36:01.938
- What the fuck is that?
- Like a dog or whatever.

36:02.010 --> 36:04.251
There is a fucking
murderer in that bush, man.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.695
- It's not a murderer.
- Hey.

36:05.770 --> 36:06.851
It's Billy Baldwin.

36:06.930 --> 36:08.614
It's fucking Laura Dern's chocolate lab

36:08.690 --> 36:10.101
- sneaking around.
- Hey.

36:10.170 --> 36:11.979
No, dude, I'm serious, man.
I'm fucking serious.

36:12.050 --> 36:14.098
- What?
- I'm out of... I'm getting out.

36:14.170 --> 36:16.571
- If it's a fucking...
- All right, guys. Joshua's weekend.

36:16.650 --> 36:19.540
- Hey, Ari, Ari?
- Whoa, we gotta go with Joshua.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.100
- We need to talk later.
- Yeah.

36:24.050 --> 36:26.212
- Just a little bit.
- Yeah, no, no, no.

36:26.290 --> 36:28.611
I don't need to be up all night talking...

36:28.690 --> 36:31.136
- talking about I don't know.
- Whatever, no, no, no.

36:31.210 --> 36:33.577
I just met a bunch of strangers

36:33.650 --> 36:35.061
and I talk their ear off
all night and, uh...

36:36.170 --> 36:37.410
- and then I just...
- But I totally understand

36:37.490 --> 36:39.652
what you were saying before
about backpack style hip-hop.

36:39.730 --> 36:40.970
I think that that is a distinction

36:41.050 --> 36:42.654
of a kind of hip-hop
that does not get mentioned that much.

36:42.730 --> 36:44.573
'Cause you're, like, Talib Kweli,

36:44.650 --> 36:46.891
Black Star,
Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul.

36:46.970 --> 36:50.816
I really think that hip-hop's, like,
a very important part of our culture.

36:50.890 --> 36:53.575
- Yes, agree 100 percent.
- But haven't you both also,

36:53.650 --> 36:55.937
like, been to Tanglewood
to see James Taylor?

36:56.010 --> 36:57.535
Yes, a hundred times.

37:12.250 --> 37:15.538
- Whoa, that's funky!
- You know what's the funkiest?

37:15.610 --> 37:19.092
This is the funkiest guy we know!

37:19.170 --> 37:21.332
Dude, dude, dude. Blow that in my mouth.

37:22.570 --> 37:24.254
Come on, man.

37:24.330 --> 37:26.059
It's really funny.

37:26.170 --> 37:27.740
Blow it in my mouth, man.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.539
- Do it, do it.
- Come on. Blow it.

37:33.090 --> 37:36.299
- Wow!
- Yeah! You guys are my band!

37:41.090 --> 37:44.412
Here's your trumpet!

37:44.490 --> 37:46.413
So when you think about
the basic paradoxes,

37:46.490 --> 37:48.333
you know, one of them,
the bootstrap paradox,

37:48.410 --> 37:51.220
dictates that no matter
what happens when you go back in time,

37:51.290 --> 37:53.099
no matter what information
you take with you,

37:53.170 --> 37:54.535
it's always been there.

37:54.610 --> 37:59.172
So if you go back, say, to yesterday
to give yourself a great stock tip,

37:59.250 --> 38:01.457
that means that there was
never a version of reality

38:01.530 --> 38:03.100
where you didn't receive that.

38:03.170 --> 38:05.411
- This is fucking fantastic.
- Thank you, thank you.

38:05.490 --> 38:07.413
- Amazing. So fucking cool.
- The other version of that...

38:07.490 --> 38:10.619
Thanks, man. The other version of that
is the grandfather paradox,

38:10.690 --> 38:13.421
which means that no matter
what happens when you go back,

38:13.490 --> 38:17.131
it's always a version
of what was going to happen.

38:17.210 --> 38:19.178
So if you go back
and your grandfather dies,

38:19.250 --> 38:21.378
that doesn't prevent you from being born.

38:21.450 --> 38:24.499
That just means that something else
is going to have to happen

38:24.570 --> 38:26.618
and it always did and you would find out

38:26.770 --> 38:28.295
that who you thought was your grandfather

38:28.410 --> 38:29.696
wasn't actually your grandfather.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.374
But what about Marty McFly?

38:31.450 --> 38:34.374
He goes back and he takes away
and he starts disappearing.

38:34.490 --> 38:35.855
What you're describing is a depiction

38:35.930 --> 38:38.774
of time travel in, you know,
pop culture fiction.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.295
What I'm talking about is science.

38:40.410 --> 38:42.412
Oh, you're talking about
something that's real.

38:42.490 --> 38:45.141
Yes, I am. Ari, you had a question?

38:45.250 --> 38:46.979
Adam, if time travel existed,

38:47.050 --> 38:48.575
don't you think that
we would know about it

38:48.650 --> 38:50.732
because someone would have
come back in time to make us aware?

38:50.810 --> 38:53.461
Excellent point. We're living in
what's called the alpha timeline.

38:53.530 --> 38:56.534
And we haven't yet arrived
at the momentous event

38:56.610 --> 38:58.772
at which everything changes as we know it.

38:58.890 --> 38:59.971
So...

39:01.290 --> 39:02.940
if that's the alpha timeline,

39:03.010 --> 39:05.012
are we over here now?

39:07.810 --> 39:13.419
Can I just quickly give a quick toast
to how fucking interesting that is?

39:13.490 --> 39:14.457
Yes.

39:14.570 --> 39:16.334
And what a fucking cool group of people

39:16.410 --> 39:18.094
that Joshua has put together here tonight

39:18.170 --> 39:20.696
for a good, solid fucking late-night hang?

39:20.770 --> 39:22.340
Cheers to that.

39:22.410 --> 39:24.458
Yeah, any... whatever you got.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.020
- Hey, hey, there you go.
- Totally.

39:26.090 --> 39:27.819
There you go.

40:27.810 --> 40:30.416
That's the weirdest way to wake up.

40:30.490 --> 40:33.937
Yeah, that's my way of saying thank you

40:34.010 --> 40:36.695
for letting me have a seventh-grade style,

40:36.770 --> 40:39.853
no Frenching, no touching sleepover.

40:40.850 --> 40:42.818
Yeah, dude, no worries.

40:42.890 --> 40:46.019
Seventh-grade sleepover style.

40:46.090 --> 40:50.493
I'm sorry that I, like,
totally dingleberried onto your night.

40:50.570 --> 40:52.459
Are you kidding? That was so fun.

40:52.530 --> 40:55.010
You crashed here. No big deal, dude.

40:55.130 --> 40:57.212
- Yeah.
- Why is your hand like that?

40:57.290 --> 41:00.021
- Move your hand.
- Because I didn't brush my teeth.

41:00.090 --> 41:01.899
Well, I don't care. Come on.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.696
What time do you think it is?

41:09.810 --> 41:11.494
Okay, yeah, you should put...

41:16.810 --> 41:19.211
Can... can I use your toothbrush?

41:19.290 --> 41:22.373
Of course. It's the white and teal one.

41:22.490 --> 41:25.221
It's not like the robot alien
one that Adam has.

41:25.290 --> 41:27.213
That guy has a dorky toothbrush?

41:27.570 --> 41:29.538
What a shocker.

41:30.130 --> 41:31.416
Hello?

41:34.930 --> 41:36.420
Come on in, guys.

41:36.490 --> 41:37.821
- I'm hungry.
- Hello?

41:37.890 --> 41:38.937
- You're hungry?
- Yeah.

41:39.050 --> 41:41.451
Josh?

41:41.530 --> 41:43.658
You think they're still asleep?

41:43.730 --> 41:46.336
This is a mess. Oh, my God.

41:46.410 --> 41:48.617
Hey, get him over here.
Come here, come here, come here.

41:49.730 --> 41:50.856
There is somebody under the coffee table.

41:50.930 --> 41:52.170
You're right, buddy.

41:54.850 --> 41:56.534
- Hey.
- Hey, I'm Eric.

41:56.650 --> 41:58.015
Hey, I'm Aaron.

41:58.090 --> 41:59.501
- Aaron, hi.
- Were you sleeping? Hey.

41:59.610 --> 42:01.658
Are you okay? You got...

42:01.730 --> 42:03.380
- And who's this guy?
- ...a little... that's my son.

42:03.490 --> 42:05.254
Hello. Hi. Nice to meet you.

42:05.330 --> 42:07.173
Hi, nice to meet you.

42:07.250 --> 42:09.014
Are you... did you get hurt?

42:09.090 --> 42:10.774
- What?
- You just have a little...

42:10.850 --> 42:13.330
Oh, no. It's just allergy season.

42:13.410 --> 42:15.856
There's like, a gun sitting here, man.

42:15.930 --> 42:17.170
Could you do me a huge favor, man?

42:17.250 --> 42:18.934
Could we just kind of
get this area picked up?

42:19.010 --> 42:20.011
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:20.130 --> 42:22.337
Do you guys... do you want
any of this before... I'm joking.

42:22.410 --> 42:24.697
- I'm all right.
- Little kids love this stuff.

42:24.770 --> 42:26.295
- Okay.
- Where is Josh?

42:26.370 --> 42:27.940
Josh?

42:28.010 --> 42:30.741
He's not under the table.
That's the extent of my knowledge.

42:34.050 --> 42:38.453
I found everybody, and I cleaned
the fucking bleed... no, just... sorry.

42:38.530 --> 42:39.861
Hey!

42:39.930 --> 42:42.536
- Cleaned up my nose.
- How's it going?

42:42.610 --> 42:44.578
Here they are.

42:44.650 --> 42:46.573
- Thanks for coming.
- Nice to see you.

42:46.650 --> 42:48.015
- Thanks for having us.
- Yeah, man.

42:48.090 --> 42:49.899
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

42:49.970 --> 42:51.574
- Yeah, thanks.
- What's up, dude?

42:51.650 --> 42:53.812
- What's up, man?
- Fucking lumberjack?

42:53.890 --> 42:55.380
Nice to see you, man.

42:55.450 --> 42:57.851
Thanks for inviting us.
Sorry we just rolled up now.

42:57.930 --> 43:00.410
Looks like we missed
a lot of the action, but...

43:00.490 --> 43:02.697
- Hi. I'm Jodi.
- Oh, hi.

43:02.770 --> 43:04.613
Hey, how's it going? I'm Anita.

43:04.690 --> 43:05.816
- Hi, Anita.
- Hi.

43:05.890 --> 43:07.813
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

43:07.930 --> 43:09.932
How do you g...
how do you know these guys?

43:10.010 --> 43:12.741
I just met Ari in the bar last night.

43:12.850 --> 43:14.693
In the parking lot, actually.

43:14.810 --> 43:16.414
Yeah, we all met. Everybody met.

43:16.490 --> 43:18.254
Oh, so you spent the night?

43:18.330 --> 43:20.492
- Yeah, yeah. I slept.
- We took her in.

43:20.570 --> 43:22.413
With a lot of liquor in my system.

43:22.490 --> 43:24.174
- Wow! That sounds like a fun time.
- Little orphan.

43:24.250 --> 43:25.331
Little stray.

43:25.410 --> 43:26.900
You guys hungry?

43:27.010 --> 43:29.536
Should we...
keep the breakfast train going?

43:29.610 --> 43:30.941
You know, I'm good.
You know what, actually,

43:31.010 --> 43:32.500
my friends probably think I'm dead.

43:32.570 --> 43:35.653
Truly, they probably think
I am like kidnapped and chopped up,

43:35.730 --> 43:37.892
- so I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

43:37.970 --> 43:40.211
But, please, do your
whole thing. I'm sorry.

43:40.290 --> 43:41.780
- Oh, yeah. Great to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Bye...

43:41.850 --> 43:43.420
- See you, Jodi.
- ...guys.

43:43.490 --> 43:45.538
- Bye, Jodi.
- Do you want me to drive you?

43:45.610 --> 43:47.738
No, I'm fine. I'm gonna walk it off.

43:47.810 --> 43:49.858
- It'd be good.
- Are you sure?

43:49.970 --> 43:51.813
- I think I should drive you home.
- No. Why?

43:51.930 --> 43:54.331
You're... and now you make me... I'm...

43:54.410 --> 43:56.697
- No, I'm not making any...
- I feel like I crashed your weekend.

43:56.810 --> 43:58.733
I'm, like, literally not trying to stay.

43:58.810 --> 44:00.778
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

44:00.850 --> 44:04.377
Okay. Cool life experience.

44:04.450 --> 44:06.657
- Yeah.
- Bye.

44:07.810 --> 44:10.381
- Over the course of the day...
- Here, you can wipe that on here.

44:10.490 --> 44:12.458
- Hey, Jude?
- What?

44:12.530 --> 44:15.136
You wanna know what your
Uncle Greg does for a living?

44:15.210 --> 44:18.737
- What?
- I make every candy in the whole world.

44:18.810 --> 44:20.460
No, he's not your Uncle Greg.

44:20.530 --> 44:24.012
If you've tasted a candy,
I made it in my kitchen.

44:24.130 --> 44:25.575
- No.
- Yeah.

44:25.650 --> 44:27.937
How you doing, Josh?
Are you talking to anybody?

44:28.050 --> 44:29.620
Are you seeing a therapist?

44:29.690 --> 44:31.852
Does Tonie count,
our dealer from last night?

44:31.970 --> 44:33.131
Yeah, that's perfect, yeah.

44:33.210 --> 44:35.292
Drown everything in drugs and...

44:35.410 --> 44:37.572
and that's just, like, the best...

44:37.650 --> 44:39.459
Oh, our blackjack dealer last night.
We went to a casino.

44:39.530 --> 44:41.771
All I hear about is, like,
the bars you guys went to,

44:41.850 --> 44:44.171
casino you went to.
Like, has anyone brought this up?

44:44.250 --> 44:46.332
Like, are you guys discussing this at all?

44:46.410 --> 44:47.775
Or are you just pretending
it didn't happen?

44:47.850 --> 44:50.740
I totally hear you, but to me,
it feels like time and place.

44:50.810 --> 44:52.255
I'm here to do what Joshua wants,

44:52.330 --> 44:55.174
and it seems to me
like Joshua got us together

44:55.250 --> 44:58.413
to have a fun weekend where he can just
fucking cut loose a little bit.

44:58.490 --> 45:00.140
Great. Let's all go get drunk.

45:00.250 --> 45:04.016
Let's also not pretend
that the reason we're here

45:04.090 --> 45:06.536
isn't something that was
super traumatic for our buddy.

45:06.610 --> 45:08.658
Even if he's going through it quietly,

45:08.770 --> 45:11.091
even more of a reason that
it's our responsibility

45:11.170 --> 45:12.376
to bring it up and talk about it.

45:12.450 --> 45:14.418
Thanks for chatting out here.

45:14.490 --> 45:17.300
Yeah, what's up, man?
You like running interference in there?

45:17.370 --> 45:18.337
- No.
- You're, like, a party wing man

45:18.410 --> 45:20.697
- who can't get serious?
- What?

45:20.810 --> 45:23.097
- What's going on?
- No, I'm just here to have a good time

45:23.170 --> 45:25.218
because that's what Joshua seems
to want to have this weekend.

45:25.290 --> 45:27.418
Well, I think that the good time happened.

45:27.490 --> 45:28.491
Oh, okay.

45:28.610 --> 45:30.260
And I happened to meet you
under a coffee table

45:30.330 --> 45:32.731
- with a fucking bloody nose.
- And I apologized about that.

45:32.810 --> 45:34.141
Check off crazy party night.
You got it, man.

45:34.210 --> 45:35.541
- Okay.
- Congratulations.

45:35.610 --> 45:37.453
- Congratulations for showing up...
- One hundred percent success.

45:37.530 --> 45:39.419
- ...with the family.
- What does that mean?

45:39.490 --> 45:41.458
It means this was, like, a boy's weekend.

45:41.530 --> 45:43.100
Where did it say boy's weekend?

45:43.210 --> 45:45.861
Where did it say bring
your wife and four-year-old son?

45:45.930 --> 45:48.740
Where'd it say not to?
I was on all the same emails you were.

45:48.850 --> 45:50.215
By the way, speaking of my wife and kid,

45:50.290 --> 45:52.099
I don't appreciate
bringing my four-year-old

45:52.210 --> 45:54.531
into a room that's, like,
coated in cocaine powder

45:54.610 --> 45:56.931
and having to basically
pry a gun out of his hand

45:57.010 --> 45:58.500
and move the bong out of the way!

45:58.570 --> 46:00.379
You think... you think
I would have just, like...

46:00.490 --> 46:02.970
if I knew your kid were coming,
I would have laid out drugs...

46:03.050 --> 46:07.100
You offered him cocaine!
He is four years old!

46:07.210 --> 46:08.780
- As a joke!
- Yeah, I suspect that you would've...

46:08.890 --> 46:10.938
My big mistake is realizing

46:11.010 --> 46:13.536
that your son had the same
fucking lame sense of humor as you...

46:13.610 --> 46:14.850
- Oh, yeah, that's really funny.
- ...and couldn't get a joke.

46:14.930 --> 46:17.217
Yeah, that's awesome, man.
What a cool guy.

46:17.290 --> 46:18.894
- But maybe if he wants to get...-
- Hey, nice to meet you, buddy.

46:18.970 --> 46:20.699
- Nice to meet you too, man.
- You know what?

46:20.770 --> 46:22.454
Go fucking do some more
cocaine and fuck yourself.

46:22.530 --> 46:25.056
All right, bud. Good hangs!

46:25.130 --> 46:27.974
- Where are we going?
- All right, is he buckled up?

46:28.050 --> 46:29.381
Yes.

46:39.970 --> 46:41.938
- There you go, baby.
- Yeah!

46:42.010 --> 46:43.614
That's a capper.

46:44.450 --> 46:46.452
I didn't mean to step on your shit, Eric.

46:46.530 --> 46:49.613
I just feel taking mushrooms
and chilling out is, like...

46:49.690 --> 46:52.455
- I don't want to go anywhere.
- No. I totally get it.

46:52.570 --> 46:55.050
And you know what?
Like, we did some boozing last night,

46:55.130 --> 46:57.132
and I think mushrooms are the play.

47:05.170 --> 47:06.979
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you, bud?

47:07.050 --> 47:10.054
Thanks for, uh, coming to fix this.

47:10.170 --> 47:12.013
Oh, no problem.
It's just an electrical problem.

47:12.130 --> 47:13.939
It's not much wrong.

47:14.050 --> 47:15.859
Sorry, you're kind of getting stuck

47:15.970 --> 47:18.541
with the only guy
who doesn't really enjoy the hot tub.

47:18.610 --> 47:19.691
I hear you, man.

47:19.930 --> 47:21.614
No, but I'll get
your balances just perfect

47:21.690 --> 47:24.500
and you'll be in this thing
in about an hour with your buddies.

47:24.570 --> 47:27.016
I don't really like getting in it myself.

47:27.090 --> 47:30.333
You know, just because
of the amount of bacteria

47:30.410 --> 47:32.333
that lives in warm still water

47:32.410 --> 47:33.821
and, you know, the way
that the kind of heat

47:33.930 --> 47:37.093
breeds a cloud of disease
that just hovers above it.

47:37.170 --> 47:39.980
Yeah, well, I guess
hot tubs aren't for everyone.

47:40.050 --> 47:42.621
Yeah, I... I can agree to that.

47:42.690 --> 47:45.091
- Definitely not for me.
- It was really nice to meet you.

47:45.170 --> 47:47.377
Do you mind if I sit here
with you while you work

47:47.450 --> 47:49.851
or... or would you rather work alone?

47:53.090 --> 47:54.580
Yeah, whatever you'd like.

47:56.610 --> 47:57.611
Can I take a picture of you?

47:57.690 --> 48:00.375
Sure.

48:05.330 --> 48:08.254
- So what happened?
- What?

48:08.330 --> 48:10.617
- With... what's her name?
- Oh, Rachel.

48:10.730 --> 48:13.131
Rachel. What'd she do? How'd she die?

48:13.210 --> 48:14.735
How'd she do it, I mean?

48:14.810 --> 48:17.700
Well...

48:17.770 --> 48:22.219
...she... she was cooking dinner
for him on his birthday,

48:22.330 --> 48:27.621
and he went down to the gym
and when he came back, she was dead.

48:27.690 --> 48:29.658
Pull!

48:29.730 --> 48:32.620
- That's so awful.
- Yeah, it's a bummer.

48:32.690 --> 48:34.658
Her parents are kind of
giving him a hard time.

48:34.730 --> 48:36.971
Why? They think he did something?

48:37.090 --> 48:42.051
I think it must be hard
to, like, admit that your child

48:42.130 --> 48:45.259
is sick like that
enough to do something, so...

48:45.330 --> 48:48.937
Oh, God, I can't believe
that I said all that stuff,

48:49.050 --> 48:50.461
- like...
- What stuff?

48:50.530 --> 48:52.612
Just, like, congratulations,

48:52.730 --> 48:54.892
- and I called her a fucking bitch.
- Oh, don't worry, dude.

48:54.970 --> 48:56.495
Joshy is...

48:56.610 --> 48:58.419
he didn't even register it.

48:58.530 --> 48:59.736
- He's like...
- That's what I do, though, you know?

48:59.810 --> 49:04.054
That's what I do. I start talking,
and I don't stop talking.

49:04.130 --> 49:05.541
- How'd she do it?
- Huh?

49:05.610 --> 49:06.975
How'd she do it? How'd she kill herself?

49:07.050 --> 49:08.859
Oh, I don't know if
that's the best place to...

49:08.930 --> 49:12.059
I gotta know. I gotta know.

49:12.130 --> 49:13.177
Well, she...

49:13.250 --> 49:14.854
I'm just gonna be wondering
about it the whole day,

49:14.930 --> 49:16.898
and I don't want that to be in my mind.

49:16.970 --> 49:19.735
She asphyxiated herself.

49:19.810 --> 49:22.131
Oh, my God.

49:22.210 --> 49:25.214
Are you kidding me? What, with a bag?

49:25.290 --> 49:27.861
I don't wanna get into the details, man.

49:27.930 --> 49:29.773
- I'm starting to feel...
- I gotta know.

49:29.850 --> 49:31.978
- What, with a rope?
- A belt.

49:32.050 --> 49:35.736
- One of his belts.
- Oh, my God, his belt.

49:35.810 --> 49:39.371
Used his belt to kill herself.

49:40.810 --> 49:43.290
Oh, I'm feeling so weird
in my stomach right now.

49:43.370 --> 49:46.533
- Yeah.
- I feel like I'm just about to explode.

49:46.610 --> 49:49.136
- My stomach.
- ...this'll be really hard.

49:49.210 --> 49:50.655
Oh, my stomach.

49:52.810 --> 49:54.812
There's no such thing as time travel.

49:54.890 --> 49:58.656
Everything is gonna stay the way it is.

49:58.730 --> 50:00.778
You can't correct anything.

50:00.850 --> 50:04.457
I can't go back and make anything right.

50:04.530 --> 50:07.340
They told me they were a good idea to hire

50:07.450 --> 50:09.817
because they're getting us
something pretty to look at,

50:09.890 --> 50:12.780
and it'd make us
look cooler than anybody else.

50:29.250 --> 50:30.490
My father went in a hot tub

50:30.570 --> 50:32.698
and started feeling
something strange in his leg

50:32.770 --> 50:35.455
and a few days later,
it had grown to a boil

50:35.530 --> 50:37.180
the size of a Ping-Pong ball.

50:37.250 --> 50:40.811
And my uncle just rolled it
with a rolling pin

50:40.890 --> 50:43.416
and when it popped, pus hit the ceiling.

50:45.690 --> 50:48.534
Wow, a disgusting story.

50:48.610 --> 50:51.739
You should have never
put their pictures online, Ari!

50:51.850 --> 50:53.898
My marriage is over!

50:53.970 --> 50:57.497
Greg, Greg, Greg.

51:03.450 --> 51:05.293
It was 10 years of being together,

51:05.370 --> 51:08.897
and her main argument was that she felt

51:08.970 --> 51:10.859
like she'd missed out on her 20s.

51:10.930 --> 51:13.536
Not entirely, but in a way that was scary

51:13.610 --> 51:15.578
as she started entering into her 30s

51:15.650 --> 51:18.051
and just, I guess,
wondered what else was out there.

51:18.170 --> 51:20.821
Imagine the fun
when you meet somebody like you

51:20.890 --> 51:23.257
who is fully able to commit.

51:23.330 --> 51:24.456
Yeah.

51:24.530 --> 51:25.691
You'll have something that you never had

51:25.810 --> 51:28.017
with this other woman,
no disrespect to what you guys had.

51:28.090 --> 51:29.819
No, you can disrespect her
all you want now.

51:29.930 --> 51:32.536
For now, the question is
just where do I go?

51:32.610 --> 51:34.294
You're gonna be just ďŹne.

51:48.610 --> 51:49.771
...look amazing.

51:49.850 --> 51:51.659
- Amazing, like, all the time?
- Yeah.

51:51.730 --> 51:53.494
- Yes.
- Jodi.

51:53.570 --> 51:55.413
- Hey, happy birthday, right?
- Hi.

51:55.490 --> 51:57.857
- Yes, it's my birthday.
- Hey, Jodi.

51:57.930 --> 51:59.614
Hey, thank you.

51:59.690 --> 52:02.341
- Happy birthday to everyone.
- This is Jen and Ali.

52:02.410 --> 52:03.696
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

52:03.770 --> 52:06.501
- Hi. Oh, okay.
- Hey.

52:06.570 --> 52:08.334
- To my happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

52:08.410 --> 52:10.094
- Adam!
- This is Ari.

52:10.170 --> 52:11.456
- Jen.
- Hi.

52:11.530 --> 52:13.532
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hi, Adam.

52:13.610 --> 52:15.339
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

52:15.410 --> 52:17.139
- This is Jen and Ali.
- Hi.

52:17.210 --> 52:18.291
- Hi.
- Jen.

52:18.370 --> 52:19.417
Adam.

52:19.490 --> 52:21.254
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

52:21.330 --> 52:22.456
- Awesome.
- Am I in trouble?

52:22.570 --> 52:23.776
No.

52:23.850 --> 52:26.581
- Do you want me to sit here?
- Sure, yeah. Why?

52:26.650 --> 52:28.015
Great.

52:28.090 --> 52:30.775
I've been wanting to apply
for this position for a long time.

52:30.890 --> 52:32.494
I'm... I'm Adam.

52:34.770 --> 52:38.741
Did... did Jodi mention me
at all to one of you?

52:38.810 --> 52:40.335
No?

52:40.410 --> 52:42.219
Because we had a nice little
conversation last night

52:42.290 --> 52:43.974
where she mentioned that she had a friend

52:44.050 --> 52:47.452
who she felt, like,
might sort of be the kind of person

52:47.570 --> 52:51.131
who would be interested in
talking to a guy like me.

52:51.210 --> 52:57.172
I'm wondering if it's you.
Or if it is you?

52:57.250 --> 52:58.900
Guys, we gotta rally here, okay?

52:58.970 --> 53:01.177
- Energy is low.
- I'm good.

53:01.250 --> 53:02.490
- You're good.
- You're the only one

53:02.610 --> 53:04.692
that's fucking good right now, Joshua.

53:04.770 --> 53:07.250
- Yeah.
- But this guy, comatose Carl,

53:07.330 --> 53:09.981
come on, man. We gotta get
some drinks in us, all right?

53:10.050 --> 53:11.575
Happy birthday.

53:11.650 --> 53:13.778
- Can I open this?
- Yeah, sure.

53:13.850 --> 53:16.899
Is this a CD mix?

53:16.970 --> 53:18.893
Yes, it is a CD mix.

53:18.970 --> 53:21.814
Does this mean you have
a time machine back to 1998?

53:21.890 --> 53:23.892
No, I just... my computer's really old,

53:23.970 --> 53:27.497
so it does have
the capabilities of burning CDs.

53:27.610 --> 53:30.534
You should be more impressed
that I actually found a...

53:30.610 --> 53:33.341
- A CD?
- A blank CD, yeah.

53:34.530 --> 53:37.932
Oh, thank you so much.

53:38.010 --> 53:39.011
It's just my size.

53:39.090 --> 53:40.421
And that is from my private collection.

53:40.490 --> 53:43.300
That's a big fatty. Thank you so much.

53:43.370 --> 53:46.419
It actually is
the loveliest birthday present

53:46.490 --> 53:48.333
that I ever could have asked for.

53:48.410 --> 53:50.981
It's very nice.

53:51.050 --> 53:53.576
Looking at the history of ancient aliens,

53:53.650 --> 53:56.051
you have to imagine
that every visit from them

53:56.130 --> 53:57.734
- kicked off a major new phase...
- Oh.

53:57.810 --> 53:59.699
...in human advancement.

53:59.770 --> 54:04.651
You know, and there's examples of it
basically at every huge leap

54:04.730 --> 54:06.698
that we've taken as a civilization.

54:06.770 --> 54:09.250
The most notable example,
I guess, that I could reference

54:09.370 --> 54:11.452
- is something like the pyramids.
- Yeah.

54:11.530 --> 54:12.941
I get it. You're preaching to the choir.

54:13.050 --> 54:14.620
There's just clearly no way

54:14.690 --> 54:17.580
that normal ancient Egyptians
could have conceived of...

54:17.690 --> 54:19.658
There's no way
that humans with human hands

54:19.730 --> 54:21.653
can build fucking pyramids. It's crazy.

54:21.770 --> 54:24.091
- I'm gonna go.
- Not only have they lasted longer

54:24.170 --> 54:26.172
than everything else
that was built around them,

54:26.250 --> 54:28.776
just they're simply not what anything
would have looked like at the time.

54:28.850 --> 54:31.820
Before you say an important
thing you have to button up...

54:31.890 --> 54:33.972
And here's the thing that's
going to blow your mind...

54:34.050 --> 54:36.212
- Button up your shirt...
- ...these visits and sort of...

54:36.290 --> 54:37.576
- You like that?
- Yeah, it's nice.

54:37.690 --> 54:39.931
I usually button
in another direction, but...

54:41.810 --> 54:43.619
Are we...

54:43.690 --> 54:46.341
...almost due for another one?

54:46.410 --> 54:49.619
We should have gone to the Vineyard.
That's all I asked.

54:49.690 --> 54:52.580
It's, like, people think I just come up
with these things arbitrarily,

54:52.690 --> 54:53.737
like, "Let's go to a vineyard." No.

54:53.810 --> 54:55.858
I do the research, okay?

54:55.970 --> 54:58.814
If we'd gone to the Vineyard,
we wouldn't have eaten mushrooms,

54:58.930 --> 55:00.773
you wouldn't have lost your fucking mind.

55:00.890 --> 55:02.858
It's just, like,
people don't listen to me.

55:02.930 --> 55:07.572
All I'm trying to do is
create a fun, dynamic weekend.

55:07.730 --> 55:11.655
I did... I did wanna, um,
tell you something, though.

55:11.730 --> 55:13.698
Okay.

55:13.770 --> 55:17.820
I didn't get a chance
to tell you last night...

55:18.290 --> 55:22.454
...but I think you should know
that I am married.

55:24.210 --> 55:27.612
I wanted to tell you last night,
but everything was a little crazy.

55:27.730 --> 55:29.300
And it's hard.

55:29.410 --> 55:32.539
Like, when do you...
when are you supposed to say that?

55:34.410 --> 55:36.333
Big time.

55:36.410 --> 55:38.458
I'm sorry, that's... that's my fault.

55:38.530 --> 55:40.339
- No.
- Yeah, it's... I should've...

55:40.410 --> 55:44.460
There's a million things
I should... I should have...

55:44.530 --> 55:46.180
That's okay.

55:46.250 --> 55:52.019
It's... like, I get that...
definitely, it is weird.

55:52.330 --> 55:55.061
And I'm, like, holding my face.

55:55.130 --> 56:00.819
But it's also, I get... you know...

56:02.410 --> 56:04.014
Like, I know you.

56:10.570 --> 56:13.176
Like, I know I've never met you,
but I know you.

56:15.930 --> 56:18.410
Well...

56:18.490 --> 56:22.654
...that's, like, very heavy shit
to throw down right now.

56:25.410 --> 56:28.493
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I feel a little embarrassed

56:28.570 --> 56:30.174
that your friends all knew.

56:30.250 --> 56:34.016
- I feel, like, stupid.
- I'm sorry.

56:34.090 --> 56:37.060
It's probably weirder for you
than it is for me.

56:37.130 --> 56:38.939
Yeah.

56:39.010 --> 56:40.978
And I think you're a nice person.

56:42.210 --> 56:46.454
And I don't really know what else to say

56:46.530 --> 56:49.136
'cause I feel, like, very weird.

56:49.250 --> 56:54.814
But, anyhow,
I do have a birthday to celebrate.

56:54.890 --> 57:00.852
And you have, yeah, you know. Thanks.

57:00.970 --> 57:04.258
It's cool. You're good.

57:07.130 --> 57:09.371
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

57:43.610 --> 57:46.454
- Everything's all right, though.
- I'm good, yeah, I'm good.

57:46.530 --> 57:48.931
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

57:49.010 --> 57:50.933
- Do you need anything?
- Nope.

57:51.010 --> 57:52.455
You want, like, a water

57:52.530 --> 57:54.180
or just, like,
even a piece of bread maybe?

57:54.250 --> 57:55.331
No, I don't want any water.

57:55.410 --> 57:57.378
You might wanna watch
your boots on the couch.

57:57.450 --> 57:59.851
We don't wanna scuff it up
and lose our deposit.

57:59.930 --> 58:01.455
Yeah, I'm good. I'm really fine.

58:03.050 --> 58:06.054
I'm good, yeah.

58:09.930 --> 58:11.216
Hey, buddy.

58:14.490 --> 58:16.254
- Hey, man. What are you doing?
- Hey.

58:16.330 --> 58:21.461
Oh... she passed out, so I don't
want her boots fucking up the couch

58:21.530 --> 58:23.214
and we lose our security deposit.

58:23.290 --> 58:25.292
- So I'm taking them off.
- Yeah, that's pretty creepy.

58:25.370 --> 58:26.701
No, no, it's not creepy.

58:26.770 --> 58:28.101
- I just...
- No, in a good way.

58:28.170 --> 58:30.013
- Oh, thanks.
- Where's your iPod?

58:30.090 --> 58:32.661
- Why?
- Because I wanna put music on.

58:32.770 --> 58:35.216
- Where's yours?
- I just have my iPhone,

58:35.290 --> 58:36.451
and it's a streaming music service.

58:36.530 --> 58:39.739
I don't get reception up here,
so just tell me where your iPod is.

58:39.810 --> 58:40.811
I mean, I'm sure it's in my room,

58:40.890 --> 58:41.891
- but I don't...
- Okay, great.

58:41.970 --> 58:43.779
Don't go to my room. Don't...

58:45.450 --> 58:48.772
Hey, buddy, you're being
a real fucking wet blanket, okay?

58:48.850 --> 58:50.534
And it's getting really, really tough

58:50.610 --> 58:53.454
to keep everything going
with you being a wet blanket

58:53.530 --> 58:55.373
and these ingrates
with no ideas of their own.

58:55.450 --> 58:57.020
Yeah, and everyone appreciates that,

58:57.090 --> 58:59.457
but, you know, like,
maybe tonight's just a wash.

58:59.530 --> 59:01.100
Like, it's pretty late. People are tired.

59:01.170 --> 59:03.537
We don't need music put on.
Maybe the night's just over.

59:03.610 --> 59:05.339
Trust me, the night is not over.

59:06.850 --> 59:11.139
- It doesn't matter... it's just...
- What the fuck am I doing here?

59:11.210 --> 59:12.621
I thought you were taking me home.

59:12.690 --> 59:14.692
To our home.
I thought you wanted to come here.

59:14.810 --> 59:16.016
No. I thought you were taking me...

59:16.090 --> 59:17.694
I thought you were
walking me home, my home.

59:17.770 --> 59:19.738
- Where's my fucking shoe?
- It's right here.

59:19.810 --> 59:21.619
- Did you take my shoes off?
- Just the one.

59:21.690 --> 59:23.579
I took it off because it was
scuffing up the couch.

59:23.650 --> 59:25.220
- Give me that.
- As long as you were passed out,

59:25.290 --> 59:26.735
- you want to get comfortable.
- You took off my shoes.

59:26.810 --> 59:28.335
You're a fucking creep.
Is that what you do?

59:28.450 --> 59:32.057
You go to bars and pretend like
you're a charming, artistic nerd?

59:32.130 --> 59:33.734
And then you lure people
back to your house?

59:33.810 --> 59:35.539
You know, let's not start
with the name calling.

59:35.610 --> 59:38.261
- And I'm not a nerd.
- No, you're not a nerd.

59:38.330 --> 59:39.570
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- Everything's fine.

59:39.690 --> 59:43.251
- Get the fuck off me!
- Are you okay?

59:43.330 --> 59:44.741
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Can I drive you home?

59:44.810 --> 59:46.016
No, I don't need you to fucking drive me.

59:46.090 --> 59:47.580
- Oh, shit.
- I know how to walk.

59:47.650 --> 59:51.735
- Oh! It's a... rental.
- You wanna borrow a coat?

59:56.210 --> 59:58.975
- What did you do?
- I think she likes me.

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:04.777
- Eric?
- Hey, yes. Come on in.

01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:07.899
Hi. If you could just
quickly come in here.

01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:11.173
- How are you?
- Hey, how are you?

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:13.378
I'm good. Nice to see you.
I'm Eric. Come on in.

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:15.054
Greg?

01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:18.498
- Oh, my God.
- Eric, what did you do?

01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:20.299
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:23.692
- Greg, lights, please.
- Hey, that's my iPod.

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:27.731
Gentlemen, let's welcome to the stage,

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:32.338
Kylie and Crystal!

01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:34.333
- Oh, my God.
- That's right.

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:36.890
- Hi, ladies. Come on in!
- Hi.

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:39.257
- Hi.
- This is Joshua.

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:40.331
It's his lucky day.

01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:43.061
Oh, you must be the one getting married.

01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:45.413
Congratulations!

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:46.651
Lucky guy.

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:48.732
Wow.

01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:51.541
- Please, unpack, ladies, unpack.
- Okay.

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:54.773
Hey, will you guys let your friend outside

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:57.501
- know that we're here?
- I'm sorry. What?

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.572
The suspicious-looking one.

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:02.779
I'm sorry,
I'm not catching a word of this.

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:06.093
I mean, suspicious
compared to the way you guys look.

01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:07.979
- Give it a slap.
- Okay.

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:09.370
Double.

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:12.977
- Do you want a dance?
- You don't have to, you know?

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:15.661
You can just... you don't have to do
all this. You can just hang out.

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:16.970
It's just whatever
makes you feel comfortable.

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:18.654
I mean, I assume you get paid either way.

01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:20.534
What do you want, though, sweetie?

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:21.657
Look.

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:22.931
You can dance while
you're doing it or you can just

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:25.661
- sit perfectly still.
- You need someone to talk to?

01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:27.937
- Always.
- When you have a bunch of thoughts

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:30.172
and you don't know
what to do with them, just crush them.

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:32.252
And then you align the thoughts, you know?

01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:34.412
And then you make logic of it. Look.

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:35.855
- You see one thought over here.
- Yeah, totally.

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:37.580
- Another thought over here.
- Yep.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:40.540
If we make four thoughts,
we can have two thoughts each.

01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:42.738
Two thoughts each, okay.

01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:44.494
You kind of look like my boyfriend.

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:46.334
- I do?
- Yeah.

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:47.417
Ladies.

01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:48.980
You're dating someone who resembles me?

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:51.297
Oh, yeah.
Not only dating, he lives with us.

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:54.214
He's a really good
step-dad to my daughter.

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:55.974
- You smell so good.
- How do we differ?

01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:58.291
I mean, does he dress like me
or does he sound like me?

01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:00.976
- Oh, he's Mexican.
- Okay, that's one crucial difference.

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:04.259
Yeah. I have to give her
insulin shots every morning.

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:06.981
Adam, your music sucks.
We got to change to a new song, buddy.

01:02:07.050 --> 01:02:09.451
She also has a really bad lung condition.

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:11.538
- See what we got on the next one.
- I'm sorry, what?

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:13.772
Classical? Come on, man!

01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:15.932
This song sucks, too. What's on your iPod?

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:17.580
Well, you... it's just on shuffle...

01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:19.856
...so I don't know what's gonna come up.

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:21.898
Well, I didn't know
that when I grabbed your shitty iPod

01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:23.460
that all the songs would fucking blow!

01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:27.137
Yeah, it's almost like when I was
putting music on my iPod a year ago,

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.861
I wasn't thinking about
fun stripper songs!

01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:31.614
No, you didn't do that!
You didn't plan anything

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:33.499
except to play your fucking board game,

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:36.255
just like nobody here
planned anything except for me!

01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:38.651
I try to do one nice thing for everybody!

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:42.894
- Bring strippers, fucking turn this...
- May I have this dance?

01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:45.980
Yes.

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.019
Don't insult my fucking friendship

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:16.740
with somebody that you
don't even know that well!

01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:20.257
Where the fuck do you even get off
coming in here with this bullshit?

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:22.731
It's just... you know what? I don't
need to stand here and be shouted at!

01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:24.420
I'll take my fucking iPod.
It's insufficient.

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:26.413
I'm sorry it's not good enough for you.

01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:29.136
Take your ball!
Go home and play kickball by yourself

01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:31.053
- with your little dickey!
- Adam, wait up.

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:33.610
Hey. No, that's fine. He's, like, sulking.

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:36.580
- I think he needs some company.
- No. He just wants to go to bed.

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:38.937
He's actually kind of lame.
And I'm not being shady right now,

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:41.820
but I'm gonna kind of, like,
not let you go up there right now.

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:43.130
- You're not gonna let me go by?
- No.

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:46.174
Crystal! Kylie! Let's go! VĂĄmonos.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.940
Thank you.

01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:50.058
- Have a good honeymoon.
- Oh, thank you.

01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:51.979
I'm not getting... aw, fuck it.

01:03:52.090 --> 01:03:53.819
- Bye.
- Bye. It was good to meet you.

01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:00.774
Sorry, pal. Sorry about that.

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:05.979
Wait. I think there's someone out there.

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:07.939
Look, there's someone right there.
Look, he's running away.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.739
- I see him. Grab the gun.
- Who the fuck is that?

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:11.736
Oh, come on.

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:44.696
I think I see something.

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:46.295
Is that a guy?

01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:50.175
Hey, are you a guy?

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:54.017
Hey, come out. Come out.
We see you, man. We see you.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:56.013
We see you. We fucking see you.

01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:57.615
Holy shit.

01:04:57.690 --> 01:04:59.613
All right, all right, it's cool.

01:05:00.850 --> 01:05:01.976
Who the fuck are you, man?

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:04.257
Okay, it's cool. It's just nature.

01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:06.498
- What?
- It's nature?

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.141
What the fuck does that mean?
Oh, oh, he's running.

01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:11.781
What do we do? Do we go after him?

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:13.261
No, no, no. Let's fucking let him go.

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:15.661
What the fuck, man?

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:45.894
So I wanted to...

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:49.774
...apologize for my behavior
last night with you.

01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:53.696
I was very aggressive and yelling at you

01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:55.420
and sort of pushing you around.

01:05:55.490 --> 01:06:00.291
And it wasn't cool and so I wanted
to say I'm sorry about that.

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:02.850
Yeah, I... I appreciate you apologizing.

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:06.577
You know, I mean, obviously,
I know that my idea of fun

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:08.294
isn't the same as everybody else's,

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:12.972
but the fact that you can say this
to me now really is much appreciated.

01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:15.098
- So thank you.
- Yeah, and you...

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:17.650
- you don't have to apologize to me.
- Okay, great.

01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:19.937
Yeah, I'm really going
through some stuff, too.

01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:24.339
And I just... I'm sorry if my energy,

01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:27.021
especially yesterday and last night,

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:29.980
was, you know, getting in the way
of you having any fun.

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:32.138
Sure. No, I appreciate
you guys both saying that.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:36.892
I think tonight is actually gonna be
a very cathartic release for all of us.

01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:40.693
Yeah, that'd be nice. Just sort of relax.

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:43.091
On that note, all right.

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:44.740
I'm gonna go take care of something.

01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:47.177
See you guys for dinner.

01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:52.452
I think maybe I'm ready to get out.

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:54.658
I don't wanna get
swimmer's cough or anything.

01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:58.251
Yeah, let's get out.

01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:05.411
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:07.294
- Come on in.
- Are you Frank?

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:08.935
I am Frank. Are you...

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:10.421
- I'm Isadora.
- Isadora.

01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:12.094
- Hi.
- Hi. Come here.

01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:13.820
You look great.

01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:16.336
This is exactly my style. I'm not kidding.

01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:17.741
- Really?
- I love that you guys have paintings.

01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:20.256
- That's so beautiful.
- I love paintings.

01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:22.253
Do you really? I do, too. I prefer that.

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.458
It's like if I see a blank wall,
it bums me out.

01:07:24.530 --> 01:07:25.736
- Yeah.
- This is very cool.

01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:27.380
- Yeah.
- Oh, it's a lot of necks.

01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:29.452
- It's very...
- It's like dogs playing poker,

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:31.214
- but people.
- Right.

01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:34.055
And here are two other
works of art right here.

01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:38.579
- Hi.
- Greg, Adam, this is, uh, Isadora.

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:41.136
Hi, I'm Isadora. Hi. Oh, nice to meet you.

01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:42.939
- Hi. I'm Greg.
- Greg.

01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:44.933
Oh, my God, you have a twin.

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:47.092
My sister's best friend Nicky
looks a lot like you.

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:49.980
- A woman? I look...
- Yeah, she's a girl.

01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:54.931
You know, I always thought
that I had ape features.

01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:56.500
That's how I've always seen myself.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:58.015
Yeah, you do, but just, like...

01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:00.013
it's like Nicky, too, but a beautiful ape.

01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:02.138
Apes are the most
beautiful creatures on this planet.

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:03.655
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:05.732
You got ape hands, too.

01:08:05.810 --> 01:08:07.653
I do?

01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:09.653
- It's a total compliment.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:13.940
- Did I miss something?
- Oh, um, Isadora here is a sex worker,

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:15.614
and she's gonna fuck us all for money.

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:17.613
- Absolutely, but not nec...
- Or whoever wants...

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:19.140
it doesn't have to be...
if you don't wanna fuck,

01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:20.894
if you wanna...
I got a lot of different holes,

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:22.654
you know what I'm saying?
So don't worry about it.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:24.573
You can do something with my feet or anal.

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:26.538
Whatever you're into.
Also, I wanna say this

01:08:26.609 --> 01:08:28.020
'cause I feel like
this definitely helps when I say this

01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:29.455
is that do not worry about money.

01:08:29.529 --> 01:08:30.861
Please put that
out of your head right now.

01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:32.978
Don't start tallying it up
like, "Oh, can I do this to her?"

01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:34.620
It's gonna add it up. Don't worry.

01:08:34.689 --> 01:08:37.819
I just wanna let you know
that what I'm into doing

01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:40.621
is whatever you are into doing.

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:44.376
Whatever relaxes you,
makes you comfortable, pleases you.

01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:45.939
Thank you for saying that.
I appreciate that a lot.

01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:47.461
- That is very cool of you.
- You're welcome.

01:08:47.529 --> 01:08:49.578
I'm gonna take you up on that.
Thank you so much.

01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:52.051
- Hey, please do.
- I would love to start with you

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:54.974
just because I feel like... is that okay?

01:08:55.050 --> 01:08:56.495
- I think that would be good.
- Sure.

01:08:56.569 --> 01:08:59.015
- That'd be great.
- Can I get...

01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:01.171
Is there a little room I can clean...

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.173
- Yeah.
- Not clean up. I'm not dirty, I swear.

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:06.459
Of course you're not dirty. Nobody would
ever think that you're dirty.

01:09:06.569 --> 01:09:07.981
I'll show you to the bathroom.

01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:10.051
No, no. I'll do it.

01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:12.019
- Great.
- Yeah.

01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:13.615
- Cool.
- Okay, cool.

01:09:13.689 --> 01:09:15.658
- All right.
- Right this way.

01:09:15.729 --> 01:09:17.300
- Great. Thank you so much.
- Madame.

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:19.099
- See you in a bit, buddy.
- God, I love this.

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:21.332
I think I'm just gonna go for a hike.

01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:23.412
- This... yeah, this isn't for me.
- What?

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:25.890
I know. I know. I...
I figured it was worth one last shot

01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:29.179
to see if I could get you laid,
but I could tell it's not your thing.

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:31.377
Sure, I appreciate it.
You know, it's very nice of you

01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:33.850
to, you know, be thinking of
everyone's pleasure all the time, but...

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:35.654
She seems cool, though,
I mean, honestly...

01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:37.334
She seems great.
I think it'll be a lot of fun

01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:40.618
for you guys to have sex with her
one after the other.

01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:42.618
- But I'll just be outside.
- Okay, buddy.

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:47.099
Hi, Jodi, hi. Hi, it's Ari.

01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:50.935
I know I... I've been
kind of stalking you,

01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:52.853
but I... I, um...

01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:59.613
No, I know, I know.

01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:01.454
I was... I gave him a, um...

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.658
why am I blanking?
A hand job, a handy, whatever,

01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:05.573
you know what I mean? I... and I was...

01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:07.493
and he was sobbing and coming
and sobbing and coming,

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:11.700
and it was so profound
to see what you could do to somebody,

01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:13.659
you know, that's not just about...
I was, like...

01:10:13.730 --> 01:10:15.573
I mean, obviously,
I'm sure he was glad he came,

01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:18.893
but to know that it was so much
more emotional than that,

01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:20.301
- so... hi.
- Hi.

01:10:20.370 --> 01:10:22.771
- Hi. I'm Isadora, hi. Hi.
- Hi.

01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:24.932
Nice to meet you. Oh, good, this is good.

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:27.092
- The more, the merrier, good.
- Oh.

01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:29.411
- All right.
- So do you see yourself

01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:32.255
- as like a healer?
- Yes.

01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:35.459
- But, like, sex stuff too, right?
- Yes, yes, yes! Oh, my God.

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:37.214
I love... oh, my God, oh, I love you.

01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:38.451
I love that you said that because...

01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:40.180
Rachel's parents are here.
They're outside.

01:10:40.330 --> 01:10:41.695
They're here now. I'm gonna go tell Josh.

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:42.851
What?

01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:45.410
But, like, you'll do,
like, fun stuff and...

01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:48.175
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
anything that you need...

01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:50.935
Joshy? Joshy!

01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:53.500
We gotta clean up! We gotta clean up!

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:54.776
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.932
- Not on my account?
- No, we...

01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:58.017
Honestly, don't.

01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:00.058
We're gonna have you go to the bathroom.
We're just gonna do a little cleanup.

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:01.211
Oh, I've gone.

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.258
I'm very cleansed out
before I ever come to any sort of...

01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:05.856
I know. I just want you to have a
last looks in there.

01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:09.697
Dude, the weed?
We gotta get rid of this coke, bud.

01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:11.340
- Come on.
- What are we doing?

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:13.094
Sit the fuck down and just be...

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:14.660
Can I just ask why are we freaking out?

01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:16.380
Sit the fuck down, Eric!

01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:18.015
Why are we freaking out like
we're in trouble? It's just parents!

01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:19.137
Please!

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:25.251
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:27.532
- Hey, Joshy.
- Hi.

01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:29.374
- Long time.
- Yeah.

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:32.021
- It's been a while.
- We knew you were here, so...

01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:33.734
- We spoke to your mother and...
- Yes.

01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:35.539
...you know, she mentioned that
you were here and we thought...

01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:37.851
- That you were here vacationing.
- Thought maybe it's time to...

01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:40.780
- Clear the air.
- Clear the air, exactly.

01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:42.892
- Yeah.
- I have pictures for you.

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:44.938
- Come in and, uh, sure.
- Oh.

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:47.217
- Yeah, just some friends of Rachels.
- Thank you.

01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:48.940
- Oh, yeah, is that...
- ...and then we can...?

01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:54.820
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:57.257
So this is, uh,
these are Rachel's parents.

01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:58.980
- How are you, Ari?
- Steve and Claudia.

01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:01.371
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I hope we're not intruding.

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:03.851
We're gonna go for a... a hike.

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:05.580
Yeah.

01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:06.617
Okay.

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:09.091
We were just talking about a book we read.

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:16.659
Have a seat. Sorry about this.

01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:18.141
It's okay.

01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:22.661
What's that pink thing?

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:24.812
Oh, this?

01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:26.654
This is, uh... it's Ari's.

01:12:26.770 --> 01:12:28.898
- He's trying to quit smoking.
- Oh, it's a filter thing?

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:30.017
- Yeah.
- My mother had one of those.

01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:32.741
- It was fancy.
- It's supposed to help.

01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:37.372
First of all, we want to apologize to you.

01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:40.972
I... I think we were both so, uh, shaken,

01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:44.497
and I think we took it out on you.

01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:46.811
Not letting you
go to the funeral, that wasn't...

01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:50.818
- ...wasn't really right, so...
- And I hope you forgive us.

01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:58.333
Well, wow, I mean, uh,
honestly, this means a lot.

01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:01.619
I mean, yes, sure, yeah, I forgive you.

01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:04.091
I mean, that was really... that was hard.

01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:06.571
It would help so much if we all just
talked about what happened that day.

01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:09.221
- It would really be helpful.
- Understanding like, you know,

01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:10.940
- the sequence of events.
- You spoke to her right before.

01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:12.455
She called me on the phone.
She called me on the phone

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:14.692
to ask me one of my recipes,
you know, which I love, of course,

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:16.135
because I'm very proud of my recipes.

01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:18.133
So help us... help us, Josh, please.

01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:19.735
Did you guys have a fight
or something when you got home?

01:13:19.810 --> 01:13:21.972
- Was there an emotional...
- So, yeah, I got home

01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:26.135
and we didn't... we talked about
what I wanted to do for my birthday.

01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:28.451
You came home and you talked...
you talked to her?

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:30.259
So she was alive when you got back?

01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:31.695
- Yeah.
- This is what I'm saying.

01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:33.374
This is different
from what you told the police.

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:34.975
No, I'm talking about
when I got home from work.

01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:37.291
I came home from work
and we started discussing

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:39.816
what I wanted to do for my birthday
and then I went to the gym.

01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:41.415
This is the part of the story
that keeps changing

01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:43.811
and this is why I wanna know
what actually happened.

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:46.217
- We just need to know what happened.
- Just tell us.

01:13:46.290 --> 01:13:49.134
I... she was depressed.

01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:50.814
- Depressed?
- She was. She was distant and...

01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:54.099
No, not Rachel.
Our Rachel was not depressed.

01:13:54.170 --> 01:13:55.581
- Never heard that.
- Look, I tried to...

01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:58.136
I tried to get kind of to the bottom of it

01:13:58.210 --> 01:14:03.853
and every time, she'd mis...
she... she'd deflect

01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:05.978
and she wouldn't answer me.
She was on, um...

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:08.530
- Drugs? Was she?
- No.

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:10.738
- You guys were taking drugs?
- No, we don't take drugs.

01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:12.972
It was medication, you know,
like, antidepressants.

01:14:13.050 --> 01:14:16.020
Okay, you don't do drugs.
She doesn't do drugs.

01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:19.816
She's taking some...
some medication from a doctor?

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:21.380
- Please tell me from a doctor?
- Yes, yes.

01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:22.497
You know, here's the thing.

01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:24.857
It's just a little
convoluted for us, right?

01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:28.338
And so we actually paid for
a second autopsy to be done.

01:14:28.410 --> 01:14:30.856
The coroner said that
it was actually inconclusive

01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:32.580
- for it to be suicide.
- Inconclusive.

01:14:32.650 --> 01:14:34.459
- They couldn't say...
- They couldn't say for sure

01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:35.691
- that it was a suicide.
- Could not say for sure.

01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:38.011
So, okay, if she's not...

01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:41.014
Hi. Thank you. I really had a nice time.

01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:43.297
I'm kind of freaking out,
so I'm gonna probably take off.

01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:45.179
Thank you, though. I love your home.

01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:47.014
So nice... it's very pretty.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:54.935
Who is this?

01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:57.741
I don't know who that is.
I don't know who that is!

01:14:57.810 --> 01:14:59.050
- I'm sure you don't know who that is.
- You don't know who she is?

01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:00.410
- No, I don't.
- 'Cause you don't party.

01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:02.094
- You don't party.
- You don't do drugs.

01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:04.093
- Let me show you something.
- Let me get this out.

01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:07.414
- You don't party.
- You don't party.

01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:08.457
- What's that?
- You don't do drugs.

01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:10.259
What is this? You taking photos of me?

01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:11.820
How about guns? That's so much fun.

01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:13.699
- This is a BB gun.
- Who is she?

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:15.221
- Who is she? Any idea?
- So much fun

01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:19.261
when women strip and gyrate all over you
when you're mourning.

01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:21.414
- When you're mourning.
- Look at that.

01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:23.811
Look at that.
Those marks were made by her?

01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:25.614
- She did not do that to herself!
- She strangled herself?

01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:27.374
- Just tell the truth!
- I am telling the truth.

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:28.457
- You killed our daughter!
- Say the truth, Josh!

01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:29.861
I'm telling the truth.

01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:32.376
- I didn't fucking kill her!
- Oh, really?

01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:35.899
I knew you were that monster.

01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:38.814
Do you fucking see this?

01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:40.216
What the fuck is this?

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:42.531
That's so we could
get all your lies on tape!

01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:44.294
- I haven't been lying!
- You're a liar.

01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:46.452
- You're a fucking liar!
- Get out!

01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:48.612
- What are you doing?
- Get out, you psychopaths. Get out!

01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:50.977
- Get out. Take your photos.
- We're gonna find out.

01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:53.098
You can keep that!
That's a little souvenir.

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:54.660
Should we go up there?

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:57.691
- We're on to you!
- Great, yeah, yeah.

01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:19.458
Is everything okay?

01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:25.575
I don't know. I'm just...

01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:28.853
I guess I'm just, um...

01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:33.371
I'm tired of her.

01:16:33.450 --> 01:16:35.293
I'm tired of, like...

01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:44.376
I'm tired of her making me feel this way.

01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:46.612
You know, because...

01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:52.652
I don't know.
She just... she... this is...

01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:57.773
It's about her.

01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:08.580
And it's been about her and...

01:17:10.890 --> 01:17:12.733
I... I guess I don't know. You know what?

01:17:12.810 --> 01:17:16.656
I'm a little... I'm a little tired of it.

01:17:19.050 --> 01:17:21.576
She checks out,
and I have to fucking deal with it!

01:17:21.690 --> 01:17:26.218
And I have to deal with missing her
and fucking feeling real fuckin' sad!

01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:29.533
And having her fucking parents...

01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:34.698
In case anyone's wondering,

01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:36.852
I didn't, and I hope
you fucking believe me

01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:38.420
because I didn't murder someone.

01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:40.413
I didn't murder her.
I loved her very much.

01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:45.018
And then I guess she thought
that the best way to return that

01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:48.930
would be to kill herself
on my fucking birthday!

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:57.340
So, I don't know.

01:17:57.450 --> 01:18:00.613
That's what I'm left with

01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:06.140
and... and... and I'm even sorry now.

01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:08.497
Like, you know, 'cause now
I'm dragging you guys in.

01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:12.695
I'm pulling you guys into this shit,
and you have your own lives.

01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:15.057
And everybody has their own problems.

01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:17.815
And now you have to sit here
and look at me do this.

01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:19.858
It's so fucking weird.

01:18:19.930 --> 01:18:22.331
It's so weird.

01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:27.051
It's so stupid.

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:30.413
I'm so fucking mad at her.

01:18:31.530 --> 01:18:33.419
I'm so mad at her.

01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:38.095
Well... well,

01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:46.094
Thanks, you know, for coming.

01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:49.891
I don't know if you guys maybe just...

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:55.091
Adam, do you wanna play your game?

01:18:57.570 --> 01:18:59.299
If you do.

01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:03.900
I think that would be pretty fun.

01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:06.212
Greg makes great grilled cheeses.

01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:08.656
I do.

01:19:08.730 --> 01:19:10.698
- Fuck it, let's play the game.
- Let's play the game.

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:13.659
All right, okay.

01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:14.970
Here.

01:19:28.090 --> 01:19:29.660
You want a tissue?

01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:32.210
Yeah. Looks used.

01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:35.533
No. This is actually
Adam's, um, handkerchief

01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:37.578
that his grandfather gave him in the war.

01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:39.061
- Oh?
- And I spit my gum in it earlier,

01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:40.695
- but it should be fine.
- Spitting his gum in it

01:19:40.770 --> 01:19:46.652
is a euphemism for using his
grandfather's handkerchief as a cum rag.

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:53.812
I got this problem. I keep coming
in my grandfather's handkerchief.

01:19:53.890 --> 01:19:56.336
I don't know what to do.
You gotta help me.

01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:42.410
So, Joshua has just rolled three ones,

01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:45.494
which means that we have been
defeated by the Turtlesaurus.

01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:48.255
However, the Mechas will stay strong.

01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:49.695
Hey, Ari?

01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:51.420
What we doing here, bud?

01:20:51.490 --> 01:20:53.413
We're all waiting for...

01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:55.936
to sign off before we launch the attack.

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:57.899
That's very good.
You're half paying attention,

01:20:57.970 --> 01:20:59.893
- but I like that.
- Good. I'll be right back.

01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:01.017
Okay.

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:02.899
This is why the grilled cheese is so
good. This is what I did into it.

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:06.941
- Hi.
- Shit!

01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:08.978
- Hey, man.
- Thanks for coming.

01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:11.860
- Oh, yeah.
- What did I do?

01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:14.581
Hey, it's Jodi from the bar!

01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:16.937
- Jodi.
- That's right.

01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:19.451
Just to catch you up,
there's been an alien invasion.

01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:21.612
We are the Mechas. We are the machines.

01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:23.021
We are fighting all these monsters.

01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:27.140
If the monsters continue to rise up,
specifically the Turtlesaurus,

01:21:27.210 --> 01:21:28.974
- we're fucked.
- Great.

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.381
- I love that kind of stuff.
- The Turtlesaurus

01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:32.930
has been a real problemsaurus for us.

01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:35.331
We're hoping for a core turbo charger.

01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:38.414
Did you say the Turtlesaurus
has been a problemsaurus?

01:21:38.530 --> 01:21:40.771
- It's been a problem for us.
- I'm gonna focus

01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:42.579
on defeating the Turtlesaurus.

01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:44.613
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:47.900
Tell me something good!

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:50.621
I'll use my charge bomb.
I'll use that on my next turn.

01:21:50.690 --> 01:21:51.691
Should I bust out a charge bomb?

01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:52.931
I don't know if you have one.

01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:55.741
We just needed to have enough
in order to dislodge the space flicker

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:56.811
and all to team up against...

01:21:56.890 --> 01:21:58.654
You should, in fact, use that charge bomb

01:21:58.730 --> 01:22:00.778
because I'd love to move
at least three or four hexes

01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:03.217
'cause this Turtlesaurus
is coming out of the side.

01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:07.659
I think that I'm gonna probably
take a break from my marriage.

01:22:09.210 --> 01:22:11.372
Okay, Eric.

01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:13.214
I shouldn't be married. There's no reason.

01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:16.055
I don't wear a ring. I've been
flirting with women all weekend.

01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:18.736
I wanna fuck other people.
So I shouldn't be married.

01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:22.615
So can I roll?

01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:24.016
Great.

01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:26.138
Pass me the die.

01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:28.816
It's been a... there's a lot going on.

01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:30.301
You guys are a hot group, you know?

01:22:30.370 --> 01:22:32.532
Fifteen!

01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:34.612
Yes!

01:22:34.690 --> 01:22:36.340
He's not gonna get
anything above an eight.

01:22:42.130 --> 01:22:45.259
If I meant to do
half of the things that I did,

01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:48.174
I'd be a fucking genius, man.

01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:51.140
- Cool.
- I'd be huge, but I am what I am,

01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:52.939
and that's all that I am. I'm fine.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.818
And I'll take Gen Highway...

01:22:56.890 --> 01:22:58.415
- Jen?
- Jen?

01:22:58.490 --> 01:23:00.094
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer!

01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:02.821
It's not Jennifer. It's... it's short
for Genesis. It's a man.

01:23:02.890 --> 01:23:04.619
Jennifer is a regular
basic bitch, aren't you?

01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:06.852
It's not a woman, and don't call me Jen.

01:23:06.930 --> 01:23:08.295
- Call me Highway.
- Okay, Highway.

01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:12.051
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:15.612
- You're not feeling...
- This doesn't seem really...

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.374
- What?
- ...weird or anything?

01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:19.214
- You're feeling weird.
- I'm feeling very weird.

01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:20.655
- Yeah, it's cool.
- Okay.

01:23:20.730 --> 01:23:22.380
It's okay.

01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:24.100
I wouldn't have come if I didn't want to.

01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:31.495
Yes!

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:33.854
Fuck, yeah, Jodi.

01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:35.375
Okay, guys.

01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:37.498
The game basically
comes down to this roll.

01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:41.097
Jodi, we need at least
a 17 or the game is over.

01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:42.660
Turtlesaurus is victorious,

01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:44.898
eats us, and then hides us
under his mutant shell.

01:23:44.970 --> 01:23:47.018
Seventeen is pretty hard. It's, uh...

01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:49.934
Out of three dice, that's only two in 18,

01:23:50.010 --> 01:23:51.421
one in nine chance.

01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:53.140
I want victory right now.

01:23:53.210 --> 01:23:55.781
This Turtlesaurus
is not gonna get into my life,

01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:57.295
not tonight. Ready?

01:23:57.370 --> 01:23:59.054
Here we go. Come on, Jodi.

01:24:02.010 --> 01:24:03.341
And?

01:24:04.770 --> 01:24:08.058
- Oh.
- Fuck!

01:24:08.130 --> 01:24:09.973
I'm so sorry. Shit!

01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:12.098
Shit, man! We played... oh,

01:24:12.170 --> 01:24:14.616
We've been playing
this fucking thing all night

01:24:14.690 --> 01:24:16.374
and that happens? Goddamn it!

01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:18.851
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Hey, Greg, Greg, Greg.

01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:25.336
Well, since it's mostly, um,
like, ruined, I think I should go.

01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:26.855
I'm okay. I just had to let it out.

01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:28.898
Goodbye, gentlemen.

01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:30.460
- Bye, Jodi from the game!
- Bye!

01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:32.214
Sorry that I lost the game.

01:24:32.290 --> 01:24:34.258
You know, it's a hard thing
to fight a bunch of robots.

01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:36.657
- You did good.
- No, it's okay.

01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:39.017
- It's not okay. I know I could...
- You're embarrassing me.

01:24:39.090 --> 01:24:40.933
- You're embarrassing.
- We'll talk about it in the hall.

01:24:41.010 --> 01:24:43.536
- See you later, turd!
- Bye, Joshy.

01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:45.055
- Bye.
- Bye, Jodi!

01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:47.337
- Bye, guys. Cool weekend.
- Jodi, I'm on your side.

01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:49.014
- Whatever, Greg.
- I would still argue

01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:50.933
that Mafia is the best board game.

01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:52.216
Yeah, well, Mafia is not a board game.

01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:54.611
There's no board. There's just sort of...

01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:56.454
- Okay. Well, then, uh...
- ...social fun and nonsense game.

01:24:57.970 --> 01:25:00.371
Well, good game, asshole.

01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:05.052
- Good game, sore loser.
- Yeah.

01:25:12.690 --> 01:25:14.613
Yeah, I...

01:25:33.450 --> 01:25:35.930
Okay. No, I'm sorry.

01:25:37.410 --> 01:25:42.450
That... is... confusing.

01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:43.816
Yeah.

01:25:43.890 --> 01:25:48.612
And... whoa!

01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:50.021
Okay, yeah.

01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:51.501
Okay, okay.

01:26:07.890 --> 01:26:09.654
All right.

01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:16.858
- Hey, Joshua.
- Thanks for coming, man.

01:26:16.930 --> 01:26:20.855
I gotta say, Eric,
this was a really fun weekend.

01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:22.420
Thank you.

01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:25.061
- Greg? Take care.
- Hey.

01:26:25.130 --> 01:26:27.178
Be in touch, we'll get something planned.

01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:29.491
I'm gonna plan a game weekend
with you, buddy.

01:26:29.650 --> 01:26:31.414
- Let's do it, a whole tournament.
- I love games now.

01:26:31.530 --> 01:26:33.931
- It's your new thing.
- Yeah, so fun.

01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:36.012
There's a lot of great literature
about them online.

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:38.172
Very critical community, so...

01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:39.615
Hey.

01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:41.170
- You, too, Adam.
- Yeah.

01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:42.297
- You, too.
- Come back.

01:26:42.370 --> 01:26:44.020
Come back and hang out.

01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:46.013
- Sure, yeah, I'd love to.
- Okay.

01:26:46.090 --> 01:26:47.979
- I'd love to.
- Thanks.

01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:49.654
I'll probably never
see you guys ever again,

01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:51.220
but that doesn't take away from the fact

01:26:51.330 --> 01:26:53.776
that this has been one of
the most important weekends

01:26:53.850 --> 01:26:56.057
of my entire life.

01:26:56.130 --> 01:26:57.973
And I thank you. I thank you for that.

01:26:58.050 --> 01:26:59.211
I don't know if you guys knew this,

01:26:59.290 --> 01:27:01.179
but Greg was a bit of a mess
before he got here.

01:27:01.290 --> 01:27:03.054
- Ha.
- Okay.

01:27:03.130 --> 01:27:04.973
- Okay.
- See you, man.

01:27:05.050 --> 01:27:06.461
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

01:27:08.370 --> 01:27:09.781
Hey, guys?

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:13.138
Positive vibes, positive energy!

01:27:13.210 --> 01:27:15.895
Positive vibes, positive energy.

01:27:15.970 --> 01:27:18.052
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:27:18.130 --> 01:27:19.256
Okay.

01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:24.657
- I'm gonna take off as well.
- Sure, man. I'll see you.

01:27:24.730 --> 01:27:26.414
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, of course, buddy.

01:27:29.970 --> 01:27:31.620
- Bye.
- See you.

01:27:31.690 --> 01:27:32.896
Take it easy, man.

01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:54.376
It was good to see you.

01:27:56.130 --> 01:27:57.131
Yeah.

01:27:57.210 --> 01:27:59.178
Thanks for coming, man.

01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:02.697
Sure. I would...

01:28:02.770 --> 01:28:05.421
I would come again.

01:28:05.490 --> 01:28:07.413
I will... I will always be coming.

01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:10.812
- Coming 24 hours a day.
- I can't stop coming.

01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:18.260
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah?
