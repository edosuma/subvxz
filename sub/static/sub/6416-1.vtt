01:45.421 --> 01:47.357
One! One!

01:52.094 --> 01:54.864
One, two, one!

01:54.930 --> 01:57.700
<i>"Dear Mother.
I hope you are keeping well...</i>

01:57.767 --> 02:00.569
<i>and not worrying too much about me.</i>

02:00.636 --> 02:03.339
<i>You mustn't think that any of us
are going to be killed...</i>

02:03.406 --> 02:06.175
<i>for they are collecting
such a force here...</i>

02:06.242 --> 02:08.512
<i>that an attack would be insane.</i>

02:08.578 --> 02:11.248
<i>The Massachusetts men
passed through here this morning.</i>

02:11.315 --> 02:15.852
<i>How grand it is to meet the men
from all the states, east and west...</i>

02:15.919 --> 02:17.921
<i>ready to fight for their country...</i>

02:17.988 --> 02:20.090
<i>as the old fellows did
in the Revolution.</i>

02:21.224 --> 02:24.761
<i>But this time we must make it
a whole country...</i>

02:24.828 --> 02:28.397
<i>for all who live here,
so that all can speak.</i>

02:30.867 --> 02:32.804
<i>Before this war began...</i>

02:32.870 --> 02:36.239
<i>many of my regiment
had never seen a Negro.</i>

02:36.306 --> 02:39.609
<i>Now the roads are choked
with the dispossessed.</i>

02:40.677 --> 02:42.981
<i>We fight for men and women...</i>

02:43.047 --> 02:46.050
<i>whose poetry is not yet written,
but which will presently...</i>

02:46.117 --> 02:49.287
<i>be as enviable
and as renowned as any.</i>

02:51.189 --> 02:54.626
<i>Last night we heard
of yet another defeat.</i>

02:54.692 --> 02:56.695
<i>But we are not disheartened.</i>

02:56.762 --> 02:59.899
<i>I am honored to be part
of such a splendid company.</i>

02:59.965 --> 03:04.235
<i>They have made me captain,
of which I am enormously proud.</i>

03:04.302 --> 03:07.438
<i>You would think it strange to see me
giving orders to a hundred men...</i>

03:07.506 --> 03:09.440
<i>most of whom are older than I am.</i>

03:10.975 --> 03:13.711
<i>Thank you for sending
my volume of Emerson.</i>

03:13.778 --> 03:16.248
<i>His words come home to me
like truth...</i>

03:16.315 --> 03:21.554
<i>'A deep man, ' he says, 'believes
that the evil eye can wither...</i>

03:21.620 --> 03:24.056
<i>that the heart's blessing
can heal...</i>

03:24.122 --> 03:27.359
<i>and that love
can overcome all odds. '</i>

03:29.562 --> 03:31.663
<i>My dearest love to Father.</i>

03:32.363 --> 03:34.300
<i>Your son, Robert."</i>

03:52.851 --> 03:52.885
Charge!
Company, forward!

03:52.885 --> 03:56.121
Charge!
Company, forward!

03:58.692 --> 04:00.560
- Charge!
- Fire!

04:14.642 --> 04:16.076
Fire!

04:18.845 --> 04:20.279
Aim!

04:21.915 --> 04:23.918
Fire!

04:32.292 --> 04:34.562
Stand. Fire!

04:38.198 --> 04:40.201
Steady, boys!

04:46.174 --> 04:48.277
- Forward!
- Fire!

04:58.586 --> 05:01.389
Forward, men!

05:01.455 --> 05:04.091
For God's sake, come on!

05:20.374 --> 05:23.678
Robert, come on!
We must fall back!

05:23.745 --> 05:25.714
No! Forbes!

05:27.384 --> 05:29.217
Forbes!

05:51.709 --> 05:53.976
Charge!

05:54.042 --> 05:55.478
Fire!

06:52.971 --> 06:54.906
You all right there, Captain?

08:26.066 --> 08:28.003
Please! Not my leg!

08:28.069 --> 08:30.906
- Where's the chloroform?
- Stop!

08:30.972 --> 08:32.908
Stop!

08:36.544 --> 08:38.746
No! Wait!

08:39.813 --> 08:41.750
- No!
- Hold on!

08:43.717 --> 08:45.319
So it's your neck?

08:45.386 --> 08:48.990
The surgeons are busy,
but I'll fix you up.

08:49.057 --> 08:50.992
- Let me know if I hurt you.
- Stop!

08:51.059 --> 08:53.195
Ah, this is nothing.

08:54.295 --> 08:57.197
- Heard the latest?
- What's that?

08:57.264 --> 08:59.801
I heard it from a friend
who's a dispatch rider...

08:59.868 --> 09:04.240
who got it from one of Stanton's clerks
in the War Office.

09:04.307 --> 09:07.543
He says Lincoln is gonna issue
an emancipation proclamation.

09:07.610 --> 09:10.513
Gonna free the slaves.

09:10.580 --> 09:14.382
- What?
- Maybe not in the border states...

09:14.449 --> 09:16.652
but he will free some, anyway.

09:16.719 --> 09:18.687
My God.

09:18.753 --> 09:21.690
He said he would have done it sooner,
only he was waiting for a big vicfory...

09:21.756 --> 09:23.960
which is, I guess, what this is.

09:24.026 --> 09:26.462
Oh, my God!

09:26.529 --> 09:29.465
Please don't cut anymore, please!

09:29.532 --> 09:31.769
Please!

09:31.834 --> 09:34.002
This might hurt you, Captain.
I'm sorry.

10:04.869 --> 10:07.337
Dashing.

10:31.796 --> 10:34.799
- Robert.
- Thomas.

10:34.866 --> 10:38.770
Captain Shaw.
I was so proud when I heard.

10:38.837 --> 10:42.073
They had no choice.
All the other officers are dead.

10:42.140 --> 10:45.009
- And Forbes?
- Impossible, as always.

10:45.076 --> 10:47.479
He's here somewhere.

10:47.545 --> 10:48.979
How about you?

10:49.046 --> 10:51.916
Working for your father,
helping him with the resettlement...

10:51.983 --> 10:53.952
for the Freedmen's Relief Association.

10:54.018 --> 10:57.922
There's a shortage of housing.
Robert! Are you all right?

10:57.989 --> 10:59.924
Yes. I'm sorry.

11:02.427 --> 11:05.898
Darling, there's someone
who wishes to meet you.

11:05.965 --> 11:09.402
General Hunter rounded up
a bunch of slaves...

11:09.468 --> 11:12.971
called them contraband
and put them in camps like cattle.

11:13.037 --> 11:16.909
The War Department decided
to issue them pikes rather than guns.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.545
Ot course they deserted.
So would I.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.816
Robert. Governor,
you know my son Robert.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.919
- Good to see you again.
- Governor Andrew.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.689
Robert, have you met
Frederick Douglass?

11:34.527 --> 11:36.496
Mr. Douglass.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.566
I understand you were at Antietam.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.108
A great and a terrible day.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.281
I could use your help.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.983
The governor is proposing to raise
a regiment of Negro soldiers.

11:58.050 --> 12:02.123
No. It was not just my idea.
Mr. Douglass...

12:02.190 --> 12:04.926
We will offer pride and dignity...

12:04.993 --> 12:07.194
to those who have known
only degradation.

12:07.260 --> 12:11.165
- Colored soldiers. Just think of it.
- Wonderful.

12:11.232 --> 12:13.968
I've submitted your name
to be commissioned colonel...

12:14.035 --> 12:17.372
of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry.

12:24.579 --> 12:26.981
Thank you, Governor.
That's...

12:27.048 --> 12:28.983
It's a wondertul idea.

12:32.321 --> 12:34.254
Excuse me.

12:38.726 --> 12:41.230
Well done, Shaw.

12:41.297 --> 12:43.798
- Splendid job, young man.
- Bravo, Robert.

13:03.085 --> 13:05.321
What's the matter?
Too much punch?

13:10.159 --> 13:14.364
I know how much you'd like to
make colonel, but a colored regiment?

13:19.001 --> 13:21.737
You know how popular that would be?

13:21.804 --> 13:24.607
Handing out guns
to a thousand coloreds?

13:33.350 --> 13:35.285
Hey, Robert.

13:36.219 --> 13:38.153
What's wrong?

13:43.326 --> 13:45.829
I'm gonna do it.

13:49.665 --> 13:51.668
You're not serious.

13:56.106 --> 13:59.242
- I want you to come with me.
- Me?

14:00.410 --> 14:02.012
And you?

14:07.717 --> 14:10.654
Can you picture me
in charge of a regiment?

14:13.623 --> 14:15.760
Picture me in charge of anything.

14:16.893 --> 14:19.863
I would be honored to have you.

14:23.569 --> 14:25.836
Then you're an idiot.

14:27.238 --> 14:31.742
Rob, is it true?
There's to be a colored regiment?

14:31.809 --> 14:34.378
So it seems.

14:34.446 --> 14:36.547
Then I am your first volunteer.

14:46.558 --> 14:49.061
Present arms!

14:51.697 --> 14:54.533
How do we look, Colonel?
We gonna whup the Secess'?

14:54.600 --> 14:56.467
When do we get the blue suit?

14:56.535 --> 14:59.070
Yeah, the blue suit.

15:06.478 --> 15:08.715
Ready to whip them Rebs.

15:08.782 --> 15:12.618
When are we gonna get to fight?

15:12.684 --> 15:14.621
Are we really gonna get to fight
this time?

15:25.565 --> 15:27.901
Attention!

15:30.937 --> 15:33.074
Morning.

15:35.943 --> 15:38.946
Good morning, gentlemen.

15:39.013 --> 15:42.249
I am Colonel Robert Gould Shaw.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.250
I am your commanding officer.

15:48.755 --> 15:51.158
It is a great pleasure
to see you all here today.

15:53.026 --> 15:57.064
It is my hope that the same courage...

15:57.131 --> 16:00.701
spirit and honor...

16:00.768 --> 16:03.204
which has brought us together...

16:03.270 --> 16:05.638
will one day restore this Union.

16:09.211 --> 16:10.878
May God bless us all!

16:16.617 --> 16:19.053
Form companies?

16:19.120 --> 16:21.423
We will commence
with forming companies.

16:21.490 --> 16:23.424
Company officers, take charge.

16:25.994 --> 16:30.032
You recruits will report
to your respective officers...

16:30.098 --> 16:34.369
by the letter of your company
in alphabetical order...

16:34.436 --> 16:39.174
which is in the top left-hand corner
of your muster sheet.

16:57.327 --> 17:00.530
- Good book, brother?
- Yes, it is, actually.

17:00.597 --> 17:03.132
Name's Searles. Thomas Searles.

17:03.199 --> 17:05.934
Jupiter Sharts, sir.
What it about, that book?

17:06.001 --> 17:08.704
It's a collection of essays...
Fourier, Emerson...

17:08.770 --> 17:11.340
all the transcendentalists.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.343
It got pictures?

17:15.278 --> 17:17.779
- Teach me?
- Yes, I'd be happy to.

17:30.928 --> 17:34.230
Look at what's walking in here!

17:34.297 --> 17:36.232
I'd rather have a hog
than a nigger.

17:36.300 --> 17:39.703
- At least you could eat the hog!
- Getting dark mighty early around here.

17:44.141 --> 17:46.744
Show us a little dance,
nigger boys!

18:04.461 --> 18:07.498
Sergeant of the Guard,
post your sentry.

18:07.565 --> 18:09.501
Yes, sir!

18:19.410 --> 18:22.213
Wait, no. That's my space, nigger.

18:22.279 --> 18:24.215
I sleep better close by the door.

18:24.281 --> 18:27.351
I prefer a space
with more reading light.

18:28.887 --> 18:31.289
Oh, I like it when niggers
talk good as white folk.

18:32.524 --> 18:34.127
I'd be happy to teach you.

18:34.193 --> 18:36.762
It would be my pleasure.

18:36.829 --> 18:40.665
Look, snowflake, I ain't got nothing
to learn from no house nigger.

18:40.732 --> 18:45.203
I am a free man,
as was my father.

18:45.270 --> 18:48.540
Good. Move your free black ass
before I bust it up.

18:48.608 --> 18:50.676
- Hey, hold up, buck.
- Nobody said nothing to you, pap.

18:50.743 --> 18:53.646
It's all right.

18:53.713 --> 18:55.647
I'll be fine over here.

18:55.714 --> 18:57.917
- Mm-hmm.
- Excuse me.

19:01.420 --> 19:03.956
Wonder when they gonna
give us the blue suit.

19:04.023 --> 19:07.794
Ain't no blue suit for the black
soldiers. Blue suits for the whites.

19:07.860 --> 19:11.464
Well, we soldiers now.

19:11.531 --> 19:14.100
Where you from, field hand?

19:14.167 --> 19:15.903
South Carolina.

19:15.969 --> 19:18.471
You ought to know better, boy.

19:18.538 --> 19:22.975
Hey, would you quit that?
Say, boy, quit that drumming.

19:35.055 --> 19:36.990
What's your name?

19:38.992 --> 19:40.928
I said what's your name, boy?

19:40.994 --> 19:44.031
- Can't you see that he's mute?
- He what?

19:44.098 --> 19:46.167
He's mute.

19:47.968 --> 19:50.337
You mean this child can't talk?

19:53.006 --> 19:54.943
Hey, come over here, hon.

19:59.446 --> 20:02.049
Dummies and field hands.
Ain't that a bitch?

20:02.116 --> 20:04.918
What about you, buck?
Whereabouts you from?

20:07.088 --> 20:09.890
I'm from around Tennessee.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.726
Ran away when I was 12 years old,
and I ain't never look back.

20:12.793 --> 20:15.096
What you doing since then?

20:15.964 --> 20:18.232
I run for president.

20:22.371 --> 20:23.972
I didn't win though.

20:34.383 --> 20:36.317
Boy.

20:57.739 --> 21:00.909
Major? Forbes.
That's you.

21:00.976 --> 21:02.511
- Thomas.
- Hello.

21:02.578 --> 21:05.081
- How are you?
- You know Charlie Morse.

21:05.147 --> 21:07.784
- Thomas Searles.
- Captain.

21:08.884 --> 21:12.222
So how was your meal?

21:12.289 --> 21:14.523
The remoulade was a trifle tart...

21:14.590 --> 21:17.059
but the souffle for dessert
more than made up for it.

21:17.126 --> 21:19.061
And your comrades?

21:22.231 --> 21:25.101
Charming. Extraordinary
conversationalists, every one.

21:25.167 --> 21:26.870
Major Forbes!

21:27.937 --> 21:31.308
- A word, please.
- Oh, excuse me, Thomas.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.148
Yes, Robert?

21:39.082 --> 21:41.351
I won't permit
that kind of fraternization.

21:41.418 --> 21:45.188
- It's only Thomas.
- He's an enlisted man.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.494
You're right, of course.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.697
I've sent for help.

21:52.764 --> 21:54.998
These men need a proper teacher.

21:55.065 --> 21:59.570
For God's sake, you march like
a bunch of crippled old goats!

21:59.637 --> 22:01.940
We're gonna be here day and night
till we get this right!

22:02.006 --> 22:05.576
One, one. Company, halt.

22:05.643 --> 22:07.746
About-face!

22:07.813 --> 22:12.350
You are ugly Mexican-African
fucking whores!

22:12.417 --> 22:15.086
We're gonna work on this
day and night, gentlemen!

22:15.153 --> 22:17.789
Forward at the half step. March!

22:17.855 --> 22:20.725
One! You half-wit black bastard.

22:20.792 --> 22:22.728
Is it true they cut your balls off
at birth?

22:22.795 --> 22:26.564
I'll work on you
till I get you broken.

22:26.631 --> 22:28.366
Company, halt!

22:28.433 --> 22:31.002
Do you not know your right
from your left?

22:31.069 --> 22:33.005
No, sir.

22:34.707 --> 22:37.141
How many here do not know
right from left?

22:39.478 --> 22:41.881
Jesus, have pity.

22:41.947 --> 22:43.749
This is your front!

22:43.816 --> 22:47.053
This is your rear!
This is your right! And this...

22:48.420 --> 22:50.689
Now you're learning, boy-o.

22:50.756 --> 22:53.459
Company, forward march!

22:53.525 --> 22:55.795
One!

22:55.862 --> 22:58.564
- Two!
- One! Two!

23:03.135 --> 23:05.205
You bloody Hindus, get it right!

23:05.272 --> 23:09.276
Stop. Start it again.
In each rank! Count!

23:10.877 --> 23:14.047
Left. Left, right, left!

23:14.114 --> 23:16.282
Right, forward, march!

23:16.348 --> 23:20.620
Left. Get your goddamn hand
out of your pocket!

23:24.124 --> 23:27.227
Bonny Prince Charlie!
Are you a gentleman?

23:27.294 --> 23:29.263
Are you a member of congress
or something?

23:29.330 --> 23:31.464
Or are you the bloody
prince of Africa?

23:31.531 --> 23:33.900
Don't look at me!
Look straight ahead!

23:33.968 --> 23:35.902
I'll heat your ass up, boy-o!

23:35.969 --> 23:39.640
The Irish are not noted
for their fondness for the coloreds.

23:39.707 --> 23:41.908
What about the uniforms?

23:41.975 --> 23:44.479
Still no word.

23:44.545 --> 23:46.479
Rifles?

23:48.416 --> 23:50.017
See to it.

23:50.084 --> 23:53.622
You're a big buck, aren't you?
You've got a lot to learn!

23:53.689 --> 23:56.425
You haven't had a master like me!

23:56.492 --> 24:00.061
<i>"Dear Mother.
The men learn very quickly.</i>

24:00.128 --> 24:02.964
<i>Faster than white troops,
it seems to me.</i>

24:03.030 --> 24:06.033
<i>They are almost grave
and sedate under instruction...</i>

24:06.100 --> 24:08.604
<i>and they restrain themselves.</i>

24:10.371 --> 24:12.540
<i>But the moment they are dismissed
from drill...</i>

24:12.607 --> 24:17.613
<i>every tongue is relaxed
and every ivory tooth is visible...</i>

24:17.679 --> 24:21.015
<i>and you would not know from the sound
of it that this is an army camp.</i>

24:22.617 --> 24:26.955
<i>They must have learned this from long
hours of meaningless, inhuman work...</i>

24:27.022 --> 24:28.956
<i>to set their minds free so quickly.</i>

24:30.359 --> 24:32.429
<i>It gives them great energy.</i>

24:32.495 --> 24:34.862
<i>There is no doubt
that we will leave this state...</i>

24:34.929 --> 24:37.900
<i>as fine a regiment
as any that has marched.</i>

24:37.966 --> 24:40.903
<i>As ever, your son, Robert."</i>

24:46.309 --> 24:48.243
They've done it.

24:51.713 --> 24:53.550
Assemble the men.

24:53.616 --> 24:53.650
Attention!

24:53.650 --> 24:55.551
Attention!

24:57.019 --> 24:58.954
Battalion!

25:03.960 --> 25:07.863
In accordance with
President Lincoln's wishes...

25:08.933 --> 25:10.866
you men are advised...

25:10.933 --> 25:15.505
that the Confederate Congress
has issued a proclamation.

25:17.775 --> 25:19.909
It reads:

25:20.811 --> 25:24.081
"Any Negro taken in arms...

25:24.147 --> 25:27.084
against the Confederacy...

25:27.150 --> 25:31.122
will immediately be returned
to a state of slavery.

25:33.824 --> 25:37.528
Any Negro taken in Federal uniform...

25:37.595 --> 25:40.864
will be summarily put to death.

25:45.302 --> 25:50.241
Any white officer taken
in command of Negro troops...

25:52.576 --> 25:55.880
shall be deemed as inciting
servile insurrection...

25:56.882 --> 25:59.685
and shall likewise be put to death."

26:06.024 --> 26:10.062
Full discharges will be granted
in the morning...

26:10.128 --> 26:12.064
to all those who apply.

26:16.034 --> 26:17.869
Dismissed.

26:21.341 --> 26:23.274
It you're not here in the morning...

26:24.377 --> 26:26.277
I understand.

26:34.553 --> 26:36.788
Still want that blue suit, nigger?

27:57.172 --> 28:00.809
- Good morning, Major.
- Sir! Formed and ready, sir.

28:00.874 --> 28:02.810
How many are left?

28:06.948 --> 28:08.883
Attention!

28:10.218 --> 28:12.155
Battalion!

28:30.273 --> 28:32.474
Glory hallelujah.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.615
Company, halt!

28:44.719 --> 28:47.290
You're not dismissed, boy-o!
Get up!

28:47.356 --> 28:52.261
You'll fall out when I say
and not before. Understand? Get up!

28:53.728 --> 28:55.665
Sergeant Major.

29:03.540 --> 29:05.842
- Sir!
- At ease, Sergeant.

29:09.980 --> 29:12.616
I have no doubt
that you are a fair man, Mulcany.

29:15.284 --> 29:17.720
I wonder if you are
treating these men too hard.

29:20.257 --> 29:22.093
You disagree.

29:23.360 --> 29:27.532
- You may speak freely.
- The boy's your friend, is he?

29:27.599 --> 29:29.566
We grew up together, yes.

29:31.235 --> 29:33.437
Let him grow up some more.

29:36.140 --> 29:38.576
- I see.
- Will that be all, sir?

29:43.614 --> 29:45.482
Dismissed.

30:02.734 --> 30:08.139
.57 caliber Enfield rifle musket.
Best in the world here, boy.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.742
Sharts.

30:09.809 --> 30:11.943
One, one, nine, one, one.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.780
Can you handle that?

30:14.847 --> 30:16.781
I can knock something down
with this.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.283
Trip.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.887
One, two, one, nine, two.

30:21.954 --> 30:25.291
- Beautiful.
- Hawkins.

30:25.358 --> 30:28.462
One, two, one, eight, six.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.930
- Jefterson.
- Yes, sir!

30:30.996 --> 30:32.932
Robert.

30:34.234 --> 30:37.837
Finally.
There's a rumor going around...

30:37.903 --> 30:40.540
that we're to be used
only for manual labor.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.541
I can't believe the things we hear.

30:45.511 --> 30:49.016
It's not true, is it? I mean,
about not being allowed to fight.

30:49.082 --> 30:51.084
The men are living for that day.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.085
I know I am.

30:56.189 --> 30:58.925
- Fletch.
- Don't bother about him.

30:58.992 --> 31:01.862
- He's just ignorant.
- Excuse me.

31:29.323 --> 31:31.526
For God's sake, come on!

31:32.894 --> 31:35.997
- Good shot!
- Do that again!

31:36.064 --> 31:38.833
Give him your weapon.
Do that again.

31:38.900 --> 31:42.903
- One dime he can't do it.
- Dime on each of you!

31:42.970 --> 31:45.505
That's a bet!
Go on, boy.

31:45.572 --> 31:47.609
Go ahead, Sharts.

31:53.915 --> 31:56.484
- That's a dime on each of you!
- Double or nofhing!

31:59.821 --> 32:01.757
Attention, company!

32:03.058 --> 32:05.226
Attention, company!

32:05.293 --> 32:07.763
As you were.

32:07.830 --> 32:09.764
Front and center.

32:14.803 --> 32:16.840
You are a good shot, Private.

32:16.907 --> 32:19.173
Thank you, sir.
Squirrel hunting.

32:21.010 --> 32:24.712
- You ever killed a man?
- No, sir.

32:24.779 --> 32:27.249
- But you're handy with a gun.
- Yes, sir.

32:29.718 --> 32:31.655
Reload.

32:38.527 --> 32:40.463
Faster.

32:42.798 --> 32:44.500
Faster.

32:50.941 --> 32:53.476
Discharge your weapon.

32:54.677 --> 32:56.847
Discharge your weapon.

32:57.746 --> 33:00.250
Do it!

33:01.853 --> 33:04.689
Now, do it again. Only this time,
I want it done quickly.

33:07.457 --> 33:10.928
A good man can fire three aimed shots
in a minute.

33:13.163 --> 33:16.601
Major Forbes, give me
your Colt revolver.

33:16.667 --> 33:18.603
- What?
- Your gun.

33:19.837 --> 33:21.772
Give it to me.

33:25.710 --> 33:27.778
Faster.

33:27.844 --> 33:29.780
Reload.

33:30.914 --> 33:32.850
Quickly. Faster!

33:35.254 --> 33:37.623
Faster! Load.

33:40.659 --> 33:43.161
Do it! Do it!

34:02.948 --> 34:05.851
Teach them properly, Major.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.487
Yes, sir.

34:13.827 --> 34:15.260
Attention, company!

34:18.263 --> 34:20.333
Ready!

34:20.400 --> 34:21.935
Aim!

34:22.001 --> 34:24.069
Fire!

34:42.554 --> 34:45.759
Good morning, Major.
You're up early.

34:45.824 --> 34:47.960
I want to talk to you.

34:48.027 --> 34:49.964
Certainly.

34:51.563 --> 34:54.701
If you wouldn't mind
getting down from your horse.

35:08.315 --> 35:12.586
- Better?
- Why do you treat the men this way?

35:15.790 --> 35:17.391
How should I treat them?

35:17.458 --> 35:20.194
Like men?

35:22.996 --> 35:26.568
And what about Thomas?
Why are you so hard on him?

35:26.635 --> 35:31.806
He's not a very good soldier.
I'm getting these men ready for battle.

35:31.872 --> 35:35.644
Robert, they're already as good
as the Seventh ever was.

35:35.711 --> 35:37.312
They march well.
They're disciplined.

35:37.379 --> 35:39.547
- No thanks to you.
- I beg your pardon?

35:39.613 --> 35:41.216
You heard me.

35:42.550 --> 35:46.388
Who do you think you are,
acting the high-up colonel?

35:46.454 --> 35:51.426
You seem to forget I know you
and so does Thomas.

35:58.266 --> 36:01.203
If you don't believe in
what we're doing here...

36:01.269 --> 36:03.238
maybe you shouldn't be part of it.

36:03.305 --> 36:06.009
Part of what?

36:06.074 --> 36:07.709
Huh?

36:07.776 --> 36:13.416
Left, right! Little finger
along the seams of your trousers?

36:13.483 --> 36:16.519
Marching is probably all
they'll ever get to do, Robert.

36:18.120 --> 36:21.090
It is my job...

36:21.156 --> 36:24.060
to get these men ready.

36:24.126 --> 36:26.896
And I will.

36:26.963 --> 36:31.401
They have risked their lives to be here.
They have given up their freedom.

36:31.467 --> 36:36.140
I owe them as much as they have given.
I owe them my freedom...

36:36.205 --> 36:37.806
my life, if necessary.

36:38.509 --> 36:40.876
Maybe so do you, Cabot.

36:41.946 --> 36:43.546
I think you do.

36:54.290 --> 36:56.459
Develop! En garde.

36:56.527 --> 36:58.462
Thrust! Develop!

37:03.167 --> 37:05.368
You're not at dancing school!
Take his head off!

37:09.107 --> 37:11.240
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What have we here?

37:11.307 --> 37:14.411
Bonny Prince Charlie
and his toy bayonet.

37:14.478 --> 37:17.983
You're not reading now.
Go on. Get over!

37:19.350 --> 37:20.952
- Now stab me.
- What?

37:21.019 --> 37:23.020
Stab me.

37:24.922 --> 37:28.727
Come on. Stab! Not tickle.
Hit me!

37:28.793 --> 37:31.830
Come on! You prissy schoolgirl!

37:31.897 --> 37:34.099
You're the worst soldier
in this company! Hit me!

37:45.544 --> 37:47.712
No shame, son. Get up.

37:49.781 --> 37:53.685
- I said get up!
- Nigger forgot to duck. That's all.

37:54.753 --> 37:57.290
Sergeant, deal with that man.

38:02.327 --> 38:07.098
I'll tell you a wee secret, son.
Learn to keep your mouth shut.

38:10.369 --> 38:13.306
Save it, son.
Save it.

38:14.472 --> 38:17.709
Carry on, Sergeant Mulcany.

38:17.776 --> 38:19.679
Robert.

38:21.248 --> 38:25.751
I'd like to speak to you
for a moment in private, it I may.

38:28.354 --> 38:33.527
Enlisted men wishing to speak
to their commanding officer...

38:33.594 --> 38:35.528
must first get permission.

38:36.863 --> 38:38.464
You understand, Private?

38:42.202 --> 38:44.370
Yes, sir.

38:45.439 --> 38:50.177
En garde! Thrust! Develop! Recover!

38:58.685 --> 39:02.189
You better put some oomph
into that, boy-o!

39:08.862 --> 39:11.665
Oh, my, my, my.

39:11.732 --> 39:14.069
Some things never change.

39:14.135 --> 39:17.072
I guess the whole world
hate the nigger.

39:17.138 --> 39:19.607
Boy, if you don't quit
that drumming in here...

39:19.674 --> 39:24.212
Honey, why don't you take your drum
on outside and practice?

39:27.181 --> 39:30.786
That Colonel Shaw, he a hard man.

39:32.253 --> 39:35.156
He a swell.
Just a nigger-beating swell.

39:35.223 --> 39:37.926
But he in the same boat
with us.

39:37.992 --> 39:41.229
Secess' come, take him, kill him too.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.298
Huh. Not him.

39:43.364 --> 39:45.066
He a swell.

39:46.002 --> 39:47.836
He just a boy.

39:49.471 --> 39:52.273
He a weak white boy.

39:52.340 --> 39:55.110
Beating on a nigger
make him feel strong.

39:56.778 --> 39:58.714
Ain't that right, snowflake?

40:00.750 --> 40:03.919
You know, he ain't never been
to no West Point.

40:03.987 --> 40:07.957
Onliest reason he in charge
is 'cause his mommy and daddy fixed it.

40:08.024 --> 40:09.960
Ain't that so?

40:18.167 --> 40:20.336
You thought he was different,
didn't you?

40:20.403 --> 40:22.338
Hmm?

40:23.607 --> 40:25.541
What you think now?

40:28.811 --> 40:31.580
You just thought you was so smart,
didn't you?

40:33.115 --> 40:35.985
You in the real school now, though,
ain't you?

40:37.621 --> 40:39.556
What you gonna do? Cry?

40:43.727 --> 40:47.698
Yeah. He sure enough learning now,
ain't he?

40:51.100 --> 40:52.869
Attention, company!

40:52.936 --> 40:55.405
Forward, march!
Right face.

40:55.472 --> 40:57.942
Oh, shit.

40:59.977 --> 41:03.380
Man say there's a farm,
ain't but two or three miles from here.

41:05.416 --> 41:09.553
Said the lady over there
give him biscuits and gravy.

41:12.055 --> 41:15.025
She said, if he bring his friends,
she feed them too.

41:15.960 --> 41:19.030
- Don't even think about it.
- What you say, Buck?

41:19.098 --> 41:22.500
Biscuits and gravy sound good to me.
Maybe get myself some real shoes.

41:22.567 --> 41:26.437
I'm telling you, boy.
They find out, they liable to shoot you.

41:26.504 --> 41:29.407
Nigger, is you a old man or old woman?
I forget.

41:30.608 --> 41:32.543
All right.

41:37.283 --> 41:39.217
Collard greens.

41:42.654 --> 41:44.590
Corn bread.

41:49.862 --> 41:51.897
Come on. Dream.

41:53.232 --> 41:55.167
I'm waiting on you.

42:06.011 --> 42:10.450
<i>"Dear Mother. News today
of the defeat at Fredericksburg.</i>

42:10.517 --> 42:14.553
<i>If things continue to go badly,
I wonder if I might not end my days...</i>

42:14.620 --> 42:17.958
<i>as an outlaw leader
of a band of fugitive slaves.</i>

42:19.059 --> 42:22.395
<i>Try as I may,
I don 't know these men...</i>

42:22.462 --> 42:25.165
<i>their music, their camaraderie...</i>

42:25.232 --> 42:28.201
<i>which is different from ours.</i>

42:28.268 --> 42:31.772
<i>I am placed in a position where,
if I were a man of real strength...</i>

42:31.838 --> 42:33.939
<i>I might do a great deal.</i>

42:34.006 --> 42:37.311
<i>But I am afraid I shall show
that I'm not of much account.</i>

42:38.011 --> 42:42.115
<i>I don't want to stand in their way
because of my own weakness.</i>

42:42.182 --> 42:46.787
<i>I miss Christmas on the Shaw Island
and the smell of the sea."</i>

42:51.525 --> 42:53.460
It's Thomas.

42:57.898 --> 42:59.834
I just wanted to say...

43:07.073 --> 43:09.010
I wanted to say...

43:12.280 --> 43:14.782
Merry Christmas, Robert.

43:18.052 --> 43:19.655
Merry Christmas, Thomas.

43:58.495 --> 44:01.096
You're Shaw, aren't you?
Merry Christmas.

44:01.163 --> 44:03.098
Kendrick, division quartermaster.

44:03.166 --> 44:05.534
This sorry piece of work is Haggis.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.269
He writes vouchers.

44:07.336 --> 44:09.105
Pleasure.

44:10.172 --> 44:13.442
- How's it going down there?
- Oh, very well. Thank you.

44:13.510 --> 44:17.614
That's all right. Brass are all up
to Division, planning the next disaster.

44:17.680 --> 44:19.950
You're among friends.

44:20.017 --> 44:22.084
How much longer do you figure
they'll last?

44:22.151 --> 44:25.020
I hear they're deserting
ten at a time.

44:25.087 --> 44:28.626
Oh, you're misinformed.
We haven't had a single incident.

44:28.693 --> 44:31.294
I figure the nigs never had it so good.

44:31.361 --> 44:33.830
Three square a day,
a roof over their heads.

44:33.897 --> 44:37.434
They gotta know nobody's
gonna let them fight. Am I right?

44:39.603 --> 44:41.205
Yes, of course.

44:42.273 --> 44:44.208
It there's anything you need...

44:44.275 --> 44:46.242
a bottle for the cold nights...

44:46.309 --> 44:50.214
Actually, I put in a requisition
for shoes two weeks ago...

44:50.281 --> 44:52.115
and I haven't heard anything.

44:52.182 --> 44:54.552
Well, provisionally speaking...

44:54.618 --> 44:57.954
we're extremely limited as to footwear.

44:58.021 --> 45:00.057
That kind of item has to be reserved...

45:00.124 --> 45:03.461
for those units
whose fighting readiness...

45:03.527 --> 45:06.530
supersede yours.

45:06.597 --> 45:08.033
You understand.

45:11.403 --> 45:13.337
Yes, I understand.

45:20.845 --> 45:23.248
- Excuse me.
- Stop by tomorrow.

45:23.315 --> 45:27.252
I have got the most delicious
local jam. Myrtle berry, isn't it?

45:27.319 --> 45:29.955
- Blueberry.
- Right, right.

45:30.022 --> 45:31.756
Nice meeting you, Shaw.

45:36.495 --> 45:38.431
Twit.

45:46.238 --> 45:48.640
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?

45:48.707 --> 45:51.778
We've caught a deserter.

46:06.059 --> 46:09.128
Oh, Lordy, this is bad.

46:09.195 --> 46:11.465
They ain't gonna shoot him, is they?

46:13.232 --> 46:15.168
Lt'll be all right...

46:15.234 --> 46:17.003
won't it?

46:19.105 --> 46:20.940
Re-form your ranks!

46:21.007 --> 46:23.644
- Re-form your ranks!
- Form your ranks!

46:24.811 --> 46:26.747
Fall in.
Quiet in the ranks.

46:28.881 --> 46:30.584
Quiet in the ranks!

46:31.651 --> 46:33.821
Untie his hands
and take off his coat.

46:36.924 --> 46:38.859
The prisoner is in position, sir.

46:38.926 --> 46:41.094
What is this?

46:41.161 --> 46:44.097
The prisoner is to be flogged
before the entire regiment.

46:44.163 --> 46:46.532
Robert, not with a whip.
Not on them.

46:48.636 --> 46:52.172
- Excuse us, Sergeant Mulcany.
- At your pleasure, Colonel.

46:56.244 --> 47:00.548
Never question my authority
in front of ofhers.

47:00.614 --> 47:02.717
Well, I is sorry, massa.

47:02.784 --> 47:05.987
You be the boss man now,
and all us chilluns must learn to obey.

47:06.053 --> 47:09.323
Major Forbes, stand at attention!

47:18.366 --> 47:19.667
Sergeant Mulcany.

47:23.170 --> 47:24.773
You may commence.

47:40.722 --> 47:42.158
Proceed.

49:09.614 --> 49:11.548
Attention.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.397
Mr. Rawlins.

49:27.199 --> 49:29.135
This morning I...

49:33.205 --> 49:35.907
It would be a great help
if I could talk to you...

49:35.975 --> 49:38.376
about the men from time to time.

49:46.052 --> 49:48.555
That's all.

49:50.655 --> 49:52.091
Shoes, sir.

50:02.968 --> 50:04.705
The men need shoes.

50:04.771 --> 50:08.308
I know. I've been after
the quartermaster for some time.

50:08.374 --> 50:10.310
Now, sir. Now.

50:14.081 --> 50:17.084
The boy was off trying to find hisself
some shoes, Colonel.

50:18.485 --> 50:21.355
He wants to fight...

50:21.422 --> 50:23.989
same as the rest of us.

50:24.792 --> 50:26.759
More, even.

50:40.273 --> 50:42.310
All of the men, like this?

50:42.377 --> 50:44.312
Yes, sir. Most of them.

51:00.227 --> 51:01.696
Good atternoon, Colonel.

51:01.763 --> 51:04.332
Change your mind about that bottle?

51:04.399 --> 51:08.369
I want 600 pair of shoes
and 1,200 pair of socks...

51:08.436 --> 51:11.072
and anything else
you've been holding out on us.

51:11.139 --> 51:14.208
- You piece of rat filth.
- I'd love to help you.

51:14.276 --> 51:17.279
- But we just don't have any.
- Not for niggers, you don't.

51:17.346 --> 51:20.982
- Not for anybody.
- I see. Pity.

51:21.049 --> 51:24.152
I'll just look and see
that you haven't misplaced them.

51:30.358 --> 51:32.228
Son of a bitch!

51:32.294 --> 51:35.564
- Damn it! You can't...
- Can't I?

51:35.631 --> 51:38.734
I'm a colonel, nasty little cuss.

51:38.800 --> 51:42.404
You really think you can keep
700 Union soldiers...

51:42.471 --> 51:44.840
without proper shoes
because you think it's funny?

51:45.709 --> 51:47.644
Where would that power come from?

51:47.711 --> 51:49.879
All right. Calm down.

51:52.915 --> 51:55.018
Look, have a drink.

52:06.830 --> 52:08.698
Hey, you barefoot men!

52:08.765 --> 52:11.067
Get over here!

52:11.134 --> 52:12.970
Shoes!

52:13.037 --> 52:14.970
Have a pair.

52:15.037 --> 52:19.110
Here's a pair there.
One pair of shoes here.

52:19.177 --> 52:22.346
Here's another pair.
One pair per customer.

52:59.283 --> 53:02.386
Steward, is there anything you need?

53:02.453 --> 53:04.856
- No, sir.
- Keep me informed.

53:04.922 --> 53:07.059
Yes, sir. I will.

53:14.633 --> 53:17.069
Shoulder arms!

53:17.836 --> 53:19.271
Sir.

53:20.405 --> 53:22.342
From the War Department.

53:31.284 --> 53:33.218
Can anything be done?

53:35.053 --> 53:38.157
- They've got families.
- I know.

53:38.223 --> 53:41.059
We'll protest this
through channels later on.

53:42.995 --> 53:44.931
- Attention, battalion.
- Yes, sir.

53:46.932 --> 53:49.702
Attention, battalion!

53:54.340 --> 53:57.843
You men enlisted in this regiment...

53:57.910 --> 54:00.013
on the understanding...

54:00.080 --> 54:03.715
that you would be paid
the regular army wage...

54:03.782 --> 54:05.719
of $13 a month.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.189
This morning I have been notified...

54:09.255 --> 54:13.661
that since you are a colored regiment,
you will be paid $10 a month.

54:15.162 --> 54:17.430
That ain't fair.
They said 13.

54:17.497 --> 54:19.900
Regiment, fall out
by company to receive pay.

54:23.303 --> 54:26.574
- Where you going, boy?
- To get paid.

54:26.640 --> 54:28.576
Ten dollar a lof of money.

54:30.344 --> 54:33.547
Hey, pop, you titting to lay down
for this too?

54:35.249 --> 54:38.020
Fall in!

54:40.989 --> 54:44.358
Hey. Come on.
Where's your pride, now?

54:44.425 --> 54:46.662
Make your mark right here.

54:46.728 --> 54:48.329
I can write my name.

54:48.397 --> 54:51.300
- Then do it.
- They gonna give us but ten?

54:51.366 --> 54:53.467
You gonna go for that?

54:53.534 --> 54:56.805
A colored soldier stop a bullet
just as good as a white one!

54:56.872 --> 54:58.807
And for less money too!

54:58.874 --> 55:02.411
Yeah! Uncle Abe got hisself
a real bargain here!

55:02.477 --> 55:04.680
- What you say, boy?
- That's right, slaves!

55:04.746 --> 55:07.683
Make your mark.
Get your slave wages!

55:07.749 --> 55:10.151
All you good colored boys,
sign up.

55:10.217 --> 55:12.154
That's right. Tear it up!

55:12.220 --> 55:14.157
Tear it up!

55:51.994 --> 55:55.766
If you men will take no pay...

55:55.833 --> 55:57.433
then none of us will.

56:03.741 --> 56:07.076
Let's hear it for the colonel!

56:15.953 --> 56:19.622
Attention, battalion!

57:05.371 --> 57:08.241
Eyes right!

57:17.517 --> 57:18.985
Eyes front!

57:25.524 --> 57:27.460
Eyes...

57:28.760 --> 57:31.164
right.

58:55.150 --> 58:58.186
Man, I forgot how hot
it was down here.

58:58.253 --> 59:00.056
Welcome home, boy.

59:00.122 --> 59:03.425
Don't worry about it, buck.
Take a good look.

59:03.491 --> 59:06.162
It's all a memory
now that the North man come.

59:06.228 --> 59:08.029
Now that we come.

59:08.864 --> 59:10.299
Colonel Shaw?

59:12.201 --> 59:15.738
Edward Pierce, special assignment
from Harper's Weekly.

59:15.805 --> 59:18.407
- Harper's Weekly?
- Serving an entire nation.

59:18.474 --> 59:23.044
A million loyal readers want to know
what happens when the 54th sees action.

59:23.111 --> 59:25.681
A million and one.

59:25.748 --> 59:28.651
Well, you'll want to see this.

59:29.720 --> 59:32.621
Attention, company!

59:32.689 --> 59:35.491
- Rawlins, front and center.
- Sir!

59:37.928 --> 59:41.865
Mr. Rawlins, this regiment
was formed with the promise...

59:41.932 --> 59:45.202
that only white ofticers
would be commissioned to lead it.

59:45.268 --> 59:48.005
Nothing was mentioned, however,
about noncommissioned ofticers.

59:49.473 --> 59:53.709
Therefore, in recognition ot initiative
taken not only for yourself...

59:53.777 --> 59:57.248
but on behalf
of the entire regiment...

59:57.315 --> 01:00:00.851
you are hereby awarded the rank
of sergeant major.

01:00:07.391 --> 01:00:09.160
Congratulations.

01:00:11.295 --> 01:00:13.230
- Thank you, sir.
- Hip, hip, hooray!

01:00:21.972 --> 01:00:24.108
Congratulations.

01:00:24.175 --> 01:00:27.612
I ain't sure
I'm wanting this, Colonel.

01:00:27.679 --> 01:00:30.114
I know exactly how you feel.

01:00:39.525 --> 01:00:44.195
Mama, they're coming home!
They're coming home!

01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:02.647
That's right. Ain't no dream.

01:01:02.714 --> 01:01:05.416
We run away slaves,
but we come back fightin' men.

01:01:05.483 --> 01:01:09.255
Go tell your folks how kingdom come
in the year of jubilee!

01:01:39.486 --> 01:01:41.787
Left! Up tight up there!

01:01:51.164 --> 01:01:55.402
- Who are these ragamuffin?
- Contrabands right out of the fields.

01:01:55.468 --> 01:01:58.205
- Hey. Hey, old man, where from?
- Massachusetts.

01:01:58.271 --> 01:02:01.608
Oona march better than we.
Oona march like the buckra soldier.

01:02:01.675 --> 01:02:04.644
- I beg your pardon?
- He says we march like white soldiers.

01:02:04.711 --> 01:02:07.081
Even talk like the buckra soldier.

01:02:07.147 --> 01:02:09.684
- Where you from?
- Oh, round about here.

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:13.153
We were slaves in the field when
the Yankee man come. Say we soldiers.

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:15.188
How you like the army, contraband?

01:02:15.255 --> 01:02:17.291
We love it.
We thank the Lord every day...

01:02:17.358 --> 01:02:19.694
for the good vittles
and these beautiful clothes.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.497
Tell true, old man.
This year, every day like Christmas.

01:02:22.563 --> 01:02:24.500
- Like what?
- Like Christmas.

01:02:28.402 --> 01:02:32.840
My country, 'tis of thee

01:02:32.907 --> 01:02:37.146
Sweet land of liberty

01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:40.748
Of thee I sing

01:02:40.815 --> 01:02:45.186
Land where my father died

01:02:45.253 --> 01:02:49.625
Land of the pilgrims' pride

01:02:49.691 --> 01:02:53.595
From every mountainside

01:02:53.662 --> 01:02:57.231
Let freedom ring

01:03:01.337 --> 01:03:02.838
Splendid.

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:06.375
They've been working for weeks
in anticipation of your arrival.

01:03:06.442 --> 01:03:08.610
We're all very excited
to have you here, Shaw.

01:03:08.677 --> 01:03:11.280
- Thank you, sir.
- Lincoln's idea.

01:03:11.346 --> 01:03:15.919
Hired a group of New Englanders to teach
our colored how to read and write.

01:03:15.985 --> 01:03:19.588
Just your sort of people,
I should think.

01:03:19.655 --> 01:03:22.658
Your regiment should enjoy
their stay here.

01:03:22.724 --> 01:03:27.663
Yes, I'm sure we'll have a fine time,
but that's not why we're here.

01:03:27.731 --> 01:03:31.268
Yes, well, can't promise you
much action.

01:03:31.335 --> 01:03:35.572
Just having the coloreds around seems to
have scared the bejesus out of the Rebs.

01:03:35.638 --> 01:03:38.074
- Colonel Shaw?
- Excuse me.

01:03:38.141 --> 01:03:40.844
I'd like you to meet
some of our instructors.

01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:43.047
Dr. Thorpe of Salem.

01:03:43.114 --> 01:03:45.080
- It's my pleasure, Colonel Shaw.
- A pleasure.

01:03:45.148 --> 01:03:47.751
Dr. Rogers of Philadelphia.

01:03:47.817 --> 01:03:51.621
- I know and admire your parents.
- You do, sir? Why, thank you, sir.

01:03:51.688 --> 01:03:55.759
Shaw, meet Colonel Montgomery.

01:03:55.825 --> 01:03:57.962
He's your brigade commander.

01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:59.964
- Colonel.
- Honored, sir.

01:04:00.031 --> 01:04:03.166
Colonel Montgomery's
a real jayhawker from Kansas.

01:04:03.233 --> 01:04:05.469
Contraband regiment
is his brainchild.

01:04:05.536 --> 01:04:09.506
You didn't think yours were the only
coloreds around, did you, Colonel?

01:04:09.572 --> 01:04:11.175
I did actually.

01:04:11.242 --> 01:04:15.311
Well, I'm sure they'll do just fine.
Have they seen any mischief?

01:04:15.378 --> 01:04:16.914
No, sir.

01:04:18.115 --> 01:04:20.918
I'm hiking a company over
to the Georgia coast in the morning.

01:04:20.985 --> 01:04:25.524
We'll be foraging for supplies.
I could use a hand.

01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:27.958
That is, it you think
your men are up to it.

01:04:29.895 --> 01:04:33.764
- They are indeed, sir.
- Good. Very good.

01:04:33.831 --> 01:04:36.400
- A pleasure.
- Good night.

01:04:36.467 --> 01:04:38.937
Beg to report, Colonel, sir.

01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:42.307
The troop is fed
and bedded down for the night, sir.

01:04:42.373 --> 01:04:45.509
Very good, Corporal.
Pass the word along to "A" Company.

01:04:45.576 --> 01:04:47.813
We'll be going into action
in the morning.

01:04:50.615 --> 01:04:52.785
Very good, sir.

01:05:06.832 --> 01:05:09.202
Your men march handsomely, Colonel.
My compliments.

01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:10.703
Thank you, sir.

01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:14.006
I am surprised at how well
you handle them.

01:05:14.072 --> 01:05:16.008
See, I am from Kentucky originally.

01:05:16.074 --> 01:05:20.213
We owned a few ourselves,
so it comes naturally to me.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.284
- You are from Boston, are you not?
- Yes.

01:05:25.553 --> 01:05:29.489
It is impossible
to imagine Boston with slaves.

01:05:45.705 --> 01:05:48.275
Company, halt!

01:05:49.877 --> 01:05:53.048
- Halt!
- Shoulder arms!

01:05:53.114 --> 01:05:56.650
Town's clean, sir.
Ain't no Rebs here, just some women.

01:05:56.717 --> 01:05:59.687
Well, all right!
You hear that, boys?

01:05:59.753 --> 01:06:01.790
Let's clear her out!

01:06:06.694 --> 01:06:08.096
What are you doing?

01:06:08.163 --> 01:06:10.699
Liberating this town
in the name of the Republic.

01:06:10.765 --> 01:06:13.400
The musket, Massa Colonel?
Never shoot it. Shoot now?

01:06:13.467 --> 01:06:15.604
Yeah, I don't see why not.
Go ahead.

01:06:17.371 --> 01:06:19.574
Shoot the lady, boys!

01:06:22.711 --> 01:06:24.646
Don't shoot!
We ain't Secess' here!

01:06:24.713 --> 01:06:26.248
That man is a civilian.

01:06:26.313 --> 01:06:28.950
That man is Secess',
and Secess' is all the same, son.

01:06:34.656 --> 01:06:39.828
Look around. You really think anybody's
gonna put these boys into real combat?

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:41.997
Do you?

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.736
They're little children, for God's sake.
They're little monkey children.

01:06:46.803 --> 01:06:48.603
You just gotta know
how to control them.

01:06:53.408 --> 01:06:55.978
Please, let go! Oh, God!

01:06:57.079 --> 01:06:59.348
You see what I mean?
Children!

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:05.855
- Animal! Leave her alone!
- Hey, boy!

01:07:05.922 --> 01:07:07.422
Take your hands oft the white lady!

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:20.337
That would not have been necessary
it that Secess' woman hadn't started it.

01:07:20.404 --> 01:07:23.107
They'll never learn.

01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:26.709
Secess' has got to be
swept away by the hand ot God...

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:29.379
like the Jews of old.

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:31.547
And now I'll have to burn this town.

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:36.553
Nigger soldiers! Nigger soldiers!

01:07:38.989 --> 01:07:41.892
Tell your men to set torches
and prepare to fire the buildings.

01:07:41.959 --> 01:07:44.061
I will not.

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:47.865
That is an order.

01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:51.468
You will do it or face charges
for disobeying your superior officer.

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:55.404
It is an immoral order, and by articles
ot war I am not bound to obey it.

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:58.375
Well, you can just explain that
at your court-marital...

01:07:59.777 --> 01:08:02.547
after your men
are placed under my command.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.929
First squad, second platoon.

01:08:17.996 --> 01:08:21.933
Fall out to set torches.
Prepare to fire the town.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.736
First squad, second platoon!
Fall out!

01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:55.134
Right face!

01:08:57.803 --> 01:09:00.606
Forward march!

01:09:00.673 --> 01:09:03.876
The colors, Sergeant Major.

01:09:03.943 --> 01:09:05.879
Change the colors.

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:09.148
What you lookin' at,
biscuit eaters?

01:09:09.215 --> 01:09:12.051
You think you better than me?
You think you my judge?

01:09:12.118 --> 01:09:14.053
You ain't nothin'!

01:09:33.073 --> 01:09:35.341
<i>"Dear Father. I need your help.</i>

01:09:38.446 --> 01:09:41.113
<i>Despite my many requests,
it has become clear...</i>

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:44.318
<i>that we are to be
used only for manual labor.</i>

01:09:46.886 --> 01:09:48.587
<i>Morale is low.</i>

01:09:48.654 --> 01:09:52.292
<i>The men 's good humor
darkened by idleness and despair.</i>

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:56.998
<i>Why keep drilling if they're never given
the opportunity to prove themselves?"</i>

01:09:57.065 --> 01:09:58.499
Attention!

01:10:00.602 --> 01:10:02.537
<i>"I have written to Governor Andrew...</i>

01:10:02.604 --> 01:10:05.038
<i>as well as to
the General Staff in Washington.</i>

01:10:05.105 --> 01:10:08.743
<i>But I feel that only a letter
directly from you to Lincoln himself...</i>

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:11.144
<i>can have the desired effect.</i>

01:10:12.214 --> 01:10:14.482
<i>I can think of no other course.</i>

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:19.020
<i>I am sure you both pray,
as I do...</i>

01:10:19.087 --> 01:10:21.123
<i>that all this
has not been in vain."</i>

01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:24.525
Look like we're goin' the wrong way.

01:10:24.592 --> 01:10:28.062
Hey. Hey, come on now.
Buck up, boys!

01:10:28.129 --> 01:10:30.465
Hey, buck up now! Come on!

01:10:30.531 --> 01:10:33.501
Someday they're gonna
let the 54th get into it, see?

01:10:33.568 --> 01:10:35.503
And all your troubles
would be over, huh?

01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:38.439
Come on now. Cheer up! Hey!

01:10:39.508 --> 01:10:43.512
- What'd you say, boy?
- "Boy"?

01:10:43.579 --> 01:10:45.315
- Let me tell you...
- Shut up, Trip...

01:10:45.382 --> 01:10:47.682
Would you get up off me, snowflake?

01:10:49.785 --> 01:10:52.154
See, let me explain
something to you.

01:10:52.221 --> 01:10:56.392
The way I figure, I figure this war
would be over a whole lot sooner...

01:10:56.458 --> 01:10:59.829
it you boys just turn right on around
and head on back down that way...

01:10:59.896 --> 01:11:02.464
and you let us head on up there
where the real fightin' is.

01:11:02.531 --> 01:11:04.500
Them men dyin' up that road.

01:11:04.568 --> 01:11:08.270
It wouldn't be nothin' but Rebs dying,
it they let the 54th in it.

01:11:08.337 --> 01:11:09.838
- Listen...
- Hold it!

01:11:11.908 --> 01:11:14.510
As you were, Trip! As you were!

01:11:16.379 --> 01:11:18.315
You men move on.

01:11:18.381 --> 01:11:23.119
Stripes on a nigger.
That's like tits on a bull.

01:11:24.988 --> 01:11:28.458
You're lookin' at a higher rank,
Corporal. You'll obey and like it.

01:11:29.559 --> 01:11:31.361
- Make me.
- I'll make you.

01:11:32.964 --> 01:11:36.434
- What the hell is goin' on here?
- Attention!

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:40.537
You! Yes, you. What's your name?
I'm putting you up on charges.

01:11:40.604 --> 01:11:43.474
- Ain't no cause for that, sir.
- What's that, Sergeant?

01:11:43.541 --> 01:11:47.544
It's just a soldiers' fight, sir.

01:11:50.814 --> 01:11:53.550
- All right. You men move along.
- Front step! Forward! March!

01:11:53.617 --> 01:11:54.819
Move it!

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:59.456
You men get back to work.
Back to work! Let's go!

01:11:59.523 --> 01:12:03.762
- We'll see you again.
- Go dig a latrine.

01:12:03.828 --> 01:12:05.897
Go strum a banjo, boy.

01:12:05.963 --> 01:12:07.398
Come on.

01:12:11.469 --> 01:12:14.872
I've got the guard.
Let me use your looking glass.

01:12:17.775 --> 01:12:19.210
Thank you.

01:12:21.647 --> 01:12:23.681
Yeah, button up that collar.

01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:27.151
Suck in that gut.

01:12:27.219 --> 01:12:29.321
Tuck in them big black lips.

01:12:29.388 --> 01:12:32.291
Lighten your skin.
Shrink up that nose.

01:12:32.357 --> 01:12:34.793
I don't have to listen to this.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.097
Where you goin', boy?

01:12:39.265 --> 01:12:43.068
- Let me by.
- Let you by?

01:12:43.135 --> 01:12:45.472
Let you by?

01:12:46.605 --> 01:12:49.008
Let me tell you something, boy.

01:12:49.074 --> 01:12:52.077
You can march like the white man.
You can talk like 'em.

01:12:52.144 --> 01:12:54.914
You can learn his songs.
You can even wear his suits.

01:12:54.981 --> 01:12:57.884
But you ain't never
gonna be nothin' to him...

01:12:57.951 --> 01:13:02.088
but an ugly-ass chimp
in a blue suit.

01:13:03.188 --> 01:13:05.125
- Oh, you don't like that, do you?
- No.

01:13:07.527 --> 01:13:10.997
What we gonna do about it?
Want to fight me, boy?

01:13:11.064 --> 01:13:14.033
Huh? What you gonna
do about it?

01:13:16.269 --> 01:13:20.006
You want to fight me, don't you?
Don't you?

01:13:24.377 --> 01:13:26.514
- Come on, nig.
- All right! All right!

01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.281
Get your hands off me,
gravedigger.

01:13:28.348 --> 01:13:30.718
Goddamn it. Does the whole world
gotta stomp in your face?

01:13:30.785 --> 01:13:34.021
- Nigger, get your hands off me.
- Ain't no niggers here.

01:13:34.088 --> 01:13:36.456
So the white man give you
a couple of stripes...

01:13:36.524 --> 01:13:38.958
next thing you know, you hollerin'
and orderin' everybody around...

01:13:39.025 --> 01:13:40.661
like you the massa himself.

01:13:40.728 --> 01:13:43.564
Nigger, you ain't nothin'
but the white man's dog.

01:13:45.733 --> 01:13:47.668
And what are you?

01:13:47.735 --> 01:13:50.504
So full of hate
you wanna fight everybody...

01:13:50.571 --> 01:13:52.973
'cause you've been whipped
and chased by hounds.

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.576
That might not be livin',
but it sure ain't dyin'.

01:13:55.643 --> 01:13:59.714
And dying's what these white boys
been doin' for goin' on three years now.

01:13:59.781 --> 01:14:03.217
Dyin' by the thousands.
Dyin' for you, fool!

01:14:03.284 --> 01:14:05.520
I know, 'cause I dug the graves.

01:14:05.587 --> 01:14:07.855
And all the time I'm diggin',
I'm asking myself, "When?

01:14:07.922 --> 01:14:10.025
When, O Lord,
is it gonna be our time?"

01:14:11.259 --> 01:14:13.762
Time's comin' when
we're gonna have to ante up.

01:14:13.829 --> 01:14:17.432
Ante up and kick in like men.
Like men!

01:14:19.167 --> 01:14:21.135
You watch who you call a nigger.

01:14:21.202 --> 01:14:24.071
It there's any niggers around here,
it's you.

01:14:24.138 --> 01:14:27.877
Smart-mouth, stupid-ass,
swamp-running nigger.

01:14:27.944 --> 01:14:30.211
It you ain't careful,
that's all you ever gonna be.

01:14:34.083 --> 01:14:36.953
You men go on back to business.

01:15:00.009 --> 01:15:01.445
Ah, Shaw.

01:15:03.178 --> 01:15:04.615
Sit down.

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:14.023
Well, Colonel,
what can I do for you?

01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:18.795
You can give me and my regiment
a transter to combat command.

01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:21.464
Couldn't do it, Colonel.

01:15:21.531 --> 01:15:24.001
You're much too valuable
to my operations here.

01:15:37.682 --> 01:15:39.183
May I sit?

01:15:40.785 --> 01:15:43.020
Thank you. Major.

01:15:52.831 --> 01:15:54.899
I've written a letter
to my father...

01:15:56.133 --> 01:16:00.504
asking him to press Governor Andrew
and President Lincoln.

01:16:00.571 --> 01:16:02.974
But I don't have to wait
for all that, do I?

01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:09.147
Colonel Montgomery, would you
bring that ashtray over here?

01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:15.653
But valuable to your operations here,
do you say?

01:16:15.719 --> 01:16:19.057
Your foraging,
your depredations?

01:16:20.091 --> 01:16:23.762
Yes, I've become quite a student
of your operations in this region.

01:16:23.828 --> 01:16:26.898
Thirty-four mansions,
I think it was, pillaged and burned...

01:16:26.965 --> 01:16:30.702
under Colonel Montgomery's expedition
of the Combahee.

01:16:30.769 --> 01:16:34.707
Four thousand bales of cotton
smuggled through the lines...

01:16:34.774 --> 01:16:36.842
with payment to parties unknown...

01:16:36.908 --> 01:16:39.445
except by you.

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:43.382
False quartermaster requisitions.
Major Forbes here has seen the copies.

01:16:43.449 --> 01:16:45.384
Yes, indeed.

01:16:45.451 --> 01:16:50.122
Along with confiscated valuables
shipped north as personal baggage.

01:16:51.557 --> 01:16:53.292
Shall I go on?

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.863
Can you?

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:01.167
I can report you
to the War Department.

01:17:02.235 --> 01:17:05.738
Oh, yes. I can do that.

01:17:13.547 --> 01:17:18.385
Let you take your regiment
out to fight?

01:17:20.788 --> 01:17:24.658
That's what you want, isn't it?
Show what they can do.

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:29.097
- When?
- You are bright-eyed, aren't you?

01:17:29.164 --> 01:17:30.997
When?

01:17:33.667 --> 01:17:37.304
Just as soon as
I can write the orders.

01:17:41.642 --> 01:17:43.076
Major.

01:17:54.889 --> 01:17:56.325
Double-quick!

01:18:02.564 --> 01:18:06.801
All right, company, in a line.
Double-quick!

01:18:06.868 --> 01:18:10.940
All right, men, form a firing line.
Over here.

01:18:11.007 --> 01:18:13.708
Form a firing line right here!

01:18:25.687 --> 01:18:28.057
Front rank, kneel!

01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:31.393
Steady, boys!

01:18:35.931 --> 01:18:39.535
Firing by battalion!

01:18:41.305 --> 01:18:42.505
Aim!

01:18:43.572 --> 01:18:45.875
Charge!

01:18:45.941 --> 01:18:47.710
Fire!

01:18:55.284 --> 01:18:59.423
Cease fire! Recover!

01:19:19.609 --> 01:19:21.211
Here they come!

01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:34.925
- Reload!
- Reload! Load!

01:19:34.992 --> 01:19:38.630
- Load it! Load it!
- Quickly, men!

01:19:38.696 --> 01:19:41.098
- Ready!
- Ready!

01:19:42.433 --> 01:19:44.535
- Aim!
- Aim!

01:19:44.603 --> 01:19:46.870
Get ready. Get ready!

01:19:46.937 --> 01:19:49.040
Fire!

01:19:59.183 --> 01:20:01.453
- Reload!
- Reload!

01:20:01.519 --> 01:20:03.554
Quickly!

01:20:03.621 --> 01:20:06.557
- Fire at will!
- Fire at will!

01:20:18.837 --> 01:20:20.339
Pour it in!

01:20:35.455 --> 01:20:37.122
Charge!

01:21:48.796 --> 01:21:51.732
Look out, boy! Look out!

01:22:09.852 --> 01:22:11.053
Fire!

01:22:24.134 --> 01:22:26.702
They're turnin' tail!

01:22:32.942 --> 01:22:34.644
Run, you Rebs!

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:46.356
Deploy skirmishers, Captain.

01:22:46.423 --> 01:22:49.826
Re-form your ranks!
Re-form your ranks!

01:23:03.873 --> 01:23:06.577
Fall in! On the double!

01:23:08.845 --> 01:23:11.082
- Form Company.
- Thomas!

01:23:17.687 --> 01:23:19.490
How do, Colonel?

01:23:20.957 --> 01:23:22.460
Hurts, doesn't it?

01:23:25.363 --> 01:23:27.299
Well, I'm extremely jealous.

01:23:27.366 --> 01:23:30.769
You'll be back in Boston before me,
sitting by the fire...

01:23:30.836 --> 01:23:34.071
reading Hawthorne,
cup of decent coffee.

01:23:34.138 --> 01:23:35.840
I'm not going back.

01:23:37.375 --> 01:23:42.179
Thomas, listen to me.
You're shot. You have to go back.

01:23:45.517 --> 01:23:49.153
Robert, promise me...

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:52.290
that you won't send me back.

01:23:55.127 --> 01:23:56.560
Promise me!

01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:02.833
All right. All right.

01:24:28.461 --> 01:24:29.895
Colonel Shaw!

01:24:29.962 --> 01:24:32.165
- What is all this?
- You haven't heard?

01:24:32.231 --> 01:24:35.635
Lee was turned back in Pennsylvania
at Gettysburg...

01:24:35.702 --> 01:24:38.971
now Grant's taken Vicksburg,
and all on the Fourth of July.

01:24:39.037 --> 01:24:40.974
- My God!
- Yeah!

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.743
It looks like it'll all be over
by Christmas.

01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:46.446
- So, how did they do?
- Splendid. Just splendid.

01:24:46.512 --> 01:24:49.083
- Any casualties?
- Forty-two.

01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:52.219
Give me the details.
I'll wire it in.

01:24:52.286 --> 01:24:54.420
I don't think we got
a prayer of making the paper.

01:24:54.487 --> 01:24:56.657
I'll talk to you later
in your tent.

01:25:13.175 --> 01:25:15.174
As you were.

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:24.051
- Trip, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:25.486 --> 01:25:28.856
You fought very well
yesterday, Trip.

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:33.460
Sergeant Rawlins has recommended
that you receive a commendation.

01:25:33.527 --> 01:25:35.497
Yes, sir?

01:25:35.564 --> 01:25:39.567
Yes, and I think you should bear
the regimental colors.

01:25:43.439 --> 01:25:45.072
Well...

01:25:46.142 --> 01:25:47.809
It's considered quite an honor.

01:25:52.014 --> 01:25:53.148
Why not?

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:01.357
Well, I'm...

01:26:03.993 --> 01:26:06.761
wantin' to say somethin', sir,
but I...

01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:10.099
Go ahead.

01:26:12.701 --> 01:26:14.971
All right. See...

01:26:18.107 --> 01:26:23.212
I ain't fightin' this war
for you, sir.

01:26:25.014 --> 01:26:26.449
I see.

01:26:28.285 --> 01:26:31.155
I mean, what's the point?

01:26:31.221 --> 01:26:33.388
Ain't nobody gonna win.
It's just gonna go on and on.

01:26:33.456 --> 01:26:36.226
- It can't go on forever.
- But ain't nobody gonna win.

01:26:36.292 --> 01:26:38.227
Somebody's gonna win.

01:26:40.497 --> 01:26:42.765
Who?

01:26:42.832 --> 01:26:47.638
I mean, you get to go on back
to Boston to a big house and all that.

01:26:49.306 --> 01:26:53.177
What about us?
What do we get?

01:26:58.683 --> 01:27:00.750
Well, you won't get anything
if we lose.

01:27:08.325 --> 01:27:09.927
What do you want to do?

01:27:11.962 --> 01:27:13.398
I don't know, sir.

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.000
It stinks, I suppose.

01:27:17.067 --> 01:27:21.072
Yeah, it stinks bad.

01:27:21.139 --> 01:27:24.741
And we all covered up in it.
Ain't nobody clean.

01:27:30.881 --> 01:27:33.717
Be nice to get clean though.

01:27:35.353 --> 01:27:36.954
How do we do that?

01:27:43.027 --> 01:27:45.864
We ante up and kick in, sir.

01:27:48.601 --> 01:27:51.770
But I still don't
wanna carry your flag.

01:27:56.741 --> 01:27:58.711
No one will ever take Charleston
without first...

01:27:58.778 --> 01:28:01.714
silencing the forts
which protect its harbor.

01:28:01.781 --> 01:28:06.018
And the first one that must
be taken is that, Fort Wagner.

01:28:08.721 --> 01:28:11.223
Wagner mounts a ten-inch Columbiad...

01:28:11.290 --> 01:28:13.961
three smoothbore 32-pounders...

01:28:14.027 --> 01:28:16.395
a 42-pound Carronade...

01:28:16.462 --> 01:28:21.467
a 10-inch Coast Mortar
and four 12-pound Howitzers...

01:28:21.534 --> 01:28:25.004
plus a garrison
of about a thousand men.

01:28:25.071 --> 01:28:27.607
As many of you gentlemen
may be aware...

01:28:27.674 --> 01:28:30.976
for the last four days
our navy has weakened Wagner...

01:28:31.043 --> 01:28:33.080
with a constant barrage.

01:28:33.146 --> 01:28:36.583
Headquarters has determined a time
for our attack.

01:28:36.650 --> 01:28:42.289
We will proceed with a direct
frontal assault tomorrow at dusk.

01:28:42.356 --> 01:28:45.859
The problem, gentlemen,
is the approach.

01:28:45.925 --> 01:28:48.528
The ocean and the marsh
leave only a narrow strip of sand...

01:28:48.595 --> 01:28:52.834
a natural defile, through which we can
only send one regiment at a time.

01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:56.436
Our best hope is that that leading
regiment can keep the Rebs occupied...

01:28:56.503 --> 01:28:59.940
long enough for reinforcements
to exploit the breach.

01:29:00.007 --> 01:29:05.679
Needless to say, casualties
in the leading regiment may be extreme.

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.515
General Strong.

01:29:11.152 --> 01:29:13.620
The 54th Massachusetts...

01:29:13.687 --> 01:29:16.723
requests the honor of leading
the attack on Fort Wagner.

01:29:26.302 --> 01:29:28.235
It's Colonel Shaw, isn't it?

01:29:28.938 --> 01:29:30.371
Yes, sir.

01:29:31.338 --> 01:29:33.708
You and your men
haven't slept for two days.

01:29:35.544 --> 01:29:36.979
That's right, sir.

01:29:37.046 --> 01:29:39.647
And you think they have the strength
to lead this charge?

01:29:44.153 --> 01:29:47.223
There's more to fighting
than rest, sir.

01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:50.459
There's character.

01:29:51.527 --> 01:29:53.596
There's strength of heart.

01:29:57.066 --> 01:30:01.402
You should have seen us
in action two days ago.

01:30:01.469 --> 01:30:03.739
We were a sight to see.

01:30:06.809 --> 01:30:08.744
We'll be ready, sir.

01:30:10.145 --> 01:30:12.114
When do you want us?

01:30:31.433 --> 01:30:34.970
O Lord, O Lord

01:30:35.037 --> 01:30:38.309
Lord, Lord, Lord

01:30:41.712 --> 01:30:44.816
He packed in the animals
two by two

01:30:44.882 --> 01:30:47.585
An ox, a camel and a kangaroo

01:30:47.652 --> 01:30:50.221
Packed them in that ark so tight

01:30:50.288 --> 01:30:53.457
I couldn't get no sleep that night

01:30:53.524 --> 01:30:55.992
Grown-up sons
Shem and Ham

01:30:56.059 --> 01:30:58.262
Tell me about God's master plan

01:30:59.764 --> 01:31:05.269
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

01:31:25.223 --> 01:31:29.795
- Tomorrow we goin' to battle.
- All right.

01:31:29.862 --> 01:31:34.533
So, Lordy, let me fight
with the rifle in one hand...

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.635
and the Good Book in the other.

01:31:36.702 --> 01:31:39.371
- Yeah!
- Amen!

01:31:40.639 --> 01:31:45.978
That if I should die
at the muzzle of the rifle...

01:31:46.044 --> 01:31:50.917
die on water or on land...

01:31:50.984 --> 01:31:56.355
I may know that You,
blessed Jesus Almighty, are with me.

01:31:56.422 --> 01:31:58.157
With Jesus!

01:32:00.392 --> 01:32:03.529
And I have no fear. Amen.

01:32:05.397 --> 01:32:10.236
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

01:32:23.182 --> 01:32:27.554
Lord, we stand before You
this evenin'...

01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:30.191
to say thank you.

01:32:30.257 --> 01:32:33.860
We thank You, Father,
for Your grace...

01:32:33.927 --> 01:32:36.496
and Your many blessings.

01:32:36.563 --> 01:32:38.933
Now, I run off...

01:32:38.999 --> 01:32:43.704
and left all my young'uns
and my kinfolk in bondage.

01:32:43.771 --> 01:32:47.006
So I'm standing here this evening,
Heavenly Father...

01:32:47.073 --> 01:32:51.912
to ask Your blessings
on all of us...

01:32:51.979 --> 01:32:56.817
so that if tomorrow
is our great getting-up mornin'...

01:32:56.884 --> 01:33:00.888
if tomorrow we have to meet
the Judgment Day...

01:33:00.955 --> 01:33:04.558
O Heavenly Father,
we want You to let our folks know...

01:33:04.625 --> 01:33:06.594
that we died facin' the enemy.

01:33:08.094 --> 01:33:11.032
We want 'em to know
that we went down standin' up...

01:33:11.098 --> 01:33:12.700
Yes, Lord!

01:33:12.767 --> 01:33:16.270
Among those that are fightin'
against our oppression!

01:33:16.337 --> 01:33:20.075
We want 'em to know, Heavenly Father,
that we died for freedom.

01:33:22.711 --> 01:33:26.280
We ask these blessings
in Jesus' name. Amen!

01:33:40.095 --> 01:33:43.231
- Trip! Come on!
- No, I ain't...

01:33:43.298 --> 01:33:45.301
You better get
your butt up there, boy.

01:33:45.368 --> 01:33:49.137
Just say what you think.
Just say what you feel. Go on now.

01:33:49.204 --> 01:33:52.909
- Come on.
- Preach it, brother.

01:33:54.677 --> 01:33:57.012
Go on. Let it out.

01:33:58.313 --> 01:34:02.551
I ain't much
about no prayin' now.

01:34:05.887 --> 01:34:09.760
I ain't never had no family and...

01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:16.366
killed off my mama.

01:34:19.769 --> 01:34:21.705
This feels funny.

01:34:21.772 --> 01:34:23.840
- Come on.
- It's all right.

01:34:25.541 --> 01:34:27.845
Come on now.
You're doin' fine.

01:34:32.649 --> 01:34:34.450
Well, I just...

01:34:42.225 --> 01:34:44.761
You know, y'all's... y'all's...

01:34:46.964 --> 01:34:48.900
Y'all's the onliest family I got.

01:34:48.967 --> 01:34:51.837
Well, that's all right.

01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:54.406
And, uh...

01:34:59.310 --> 01:35:02.246
- I love the 54th.
- All right.

01:35:11.156 --> 01:35:15.861
Ain't much matter what happens tomorrow,
'cause we men, ain't we?

01:35:15.927 --> 01:35:17.861
- Yes, sir!
- Amen!

01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:25.704
- We men, ain't we?
- Yes, sir!

01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:34.613
Shit.

01:35:34.679 --> 01:35:36.114
All right.

01:36:35.242 --> 01:36:39.145
- Attention, company!
- Attention, company!

01:36:49.457 --> 01:36:52.926
Battalion, halt!

01:37:04.439 --> 01:37:07.610
We ready, Colonel.

01:37:41.277 --> 01:37:46.248
Left! Left! Left, right!

01:38:00.296 --> 01:38:04.401
- Give 'em hell, 54th!
- Give 'em hell, 54th!

01:38:40.037 --> 01:38:44.608
- Ready! Fire!
- Ready! Fire!

01:38:44.675 --> 01:38:48.112
- Ought to be quite a show, Pierce.
- Best seat in the house.

01:38:49.681 --> 01:38:51.748
I wonder if you might
do something for me.

01:38:56.187 --> 01:39:00.224
I have some letters here.
Personal things.

01:39:00.291 --> 01:39:01.961
Certainly, Colonel.

01:39:02.027 --> 01:39:05.463
Also, if I should fall...

01:39:08.766 --> 01:39:10.769
remember what you see here.

01:39:13.237 --> 01:39:16.909
- Ready!
- Fire!

01:39:18.843 --> 01:39:20.778
- Reload!
- Fire!

01:39:24.116 --> 01:39:29.555
You men are relieved!
Report to the rear as stretcher bearers.

01:39:29.622 --> 01:39:31.957
- Do it now!
- About-face!

01:39:32.024 --> 01:39:34.325
Forward! March!

01:39:38.831 --> 01:39:42.034
You go on, honey.
We be by directly.

01:41:01.616 --> 01:41:04.886
Colonel Shaw!

01:41:50.633 --> 01:41:52.668
It this man should fall...

01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:58.507
who will lift the flag
and carry on?

01:42:02.513 --> 01:42:04.613
I will.

01:42:06.683 --> 01:42:07.951
Huzzah!

01:42:17.828 --> 01:42:19.763
I'll see you in the fort, Thomas.

01:42:36.114 --> 01:42:37.381
- Fix!
- Fix!

01:42:37.448 --> 01:42:39.617
Bayonets!

01:42:43.887 --> 01:42:46.424
- Shoulder!
- Shoulder!

01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:47.926
Arms!

01:42:52.597 --> 01:42:55.467
- Charge!
- Charge!

01:42:55.534 --> 01:42:56.868
Bayonets!

01:43:03.374 --> 01:43:05.509
At the quickstep!

01:43:08.212 --> 01:43:09.915
Forward!

01:43:11.482 --> 01:43:13.251
March!

01:43:31.738 --> 01:43:34.073
Double-quick time!

01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:36.508
March!

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:46.686
Steady, boys!

01:44:21.222 --> 01:44:22.890
Charge!

01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:38.906
Charge!

01:44:40.541 --> 01:44:41.809
Come on!

01:44:47.048 --> 01:44:50.618
Forward! Forward!

01:45:03.932 --> 01:45:05.466
Keep your ranks!

01:45:14.442 --> 01:45:16.044
Take cover in the dunes!

01:45:16.111 --> 01:45:18.714
Take cover!

01:45:54.918 --> 01:46:00.390
