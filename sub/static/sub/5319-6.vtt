seen that side of him.

to be on life-support.

He said that right to the fucking camera.

11:59.190 --> 12:00.590
Exactly.

But God didn't just grant him that gift.

12:02.281 --> 12:03.529
He had to work for it.

12:03.530 --> 12:06.450
While others ate, he fasted.

12:06.451 --> 12:07.599

12:07.600 --> 12:10.850

23:16.000 --> 23:17.650
What the fuck is wrong with you?

23:17.700 --> 23:19.350
Who are you talking to?

23:19.400 --> 23:20.850
You play the game until you win the game.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.490
Oh, Dad, you've been saying
that since I was a kid

23:22.540 --> 23:24.360
and you were running for the school board.

23:24.410 --> 23:26.130
Okay? Now, you're the mayor.

23:26.180 --> 23:28.260
Which means, at the very least,
I know how to get things done.

23:28.310 --> 23:30.860
Yeah, but do you know
how to make a difference?

23:30.910 --> 23:32.310
I am one concrete pour away

23:32.350 --> 23:33.770
from making the biggest fucking difference

23:33.771 --> 23:34.749
in the history of this city.

23:34.750 --> 23:38.640
Are you fucking serious? Look, Dad...

23:38.690 --> 23:41.240
Cops still fuck with me
when I'm jogging in the hood.

23:41.290 --> 23:43.140
White guys at nice restaurants

23:43.190 --> 23:44.680
still throw me their keys at the valet.

23:44.730 --> 23:48.150
Schools are getting
shot-up and left for dead.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.450
Okay, the same schools you went to.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.990
And I'm gonna fix all of that.

23:52.991 --> 23:54.299
When?

23:54.300 --> 23:57.660
You think Brooks is the magic bullet?

23:57.710 --> 24:00.160
Look, you just let that
asshole who ranks below you

24:00.210 --> 24:02.160
call you a nigger...

24:02.210 --> 24:04.900
N-I-G-G-E-R...

24:04.950 --> 24:06.570
in the name of Brooks.

24:06.620 --> 24:08.630
You're reading too many
Huey Newton speeches.

24:08.649 --> 24:10.049
No, I'm not, Dad.

24:10.050 --> 24:11.770
I'm telling kids they can
grow up to be like you one day,

24:11.820 --> 24:14.470
and I'm waiting for you to set the example.

24:26.070 --> 24:28.720
They all think it.

24:28.770 --> 24:31.520
So who gives a fuck if they say it?

24:31.570 --> 24:34.760
As long as they don't stop me
from getting what I came for.

24:35.980 --> 24:37.960
And when you get that, Dad,

24:38.010 --> 24:39.770
what are you gonna have left?

24:50.090 --> 24:52.780
The view alone is worth the price.

24:52.830 --> 24:56.220
It is beautiful, but can you headline

24:56.270 --> 24:58.480
the building's security features for me?

24:58.530 --> 25:00.020
My client and his wife just had a baby

25:00.070 --> 25:01.990
and they have kidnapping concerns.

25:02.040 --> 25:05.090
Well, uh, the lobby, the
parking garage, elevators...

25:05.140 --> 25:07.230
all have video surveillance.

25:07.280 --> 25:09.960
We have a doorman 24 hours a day.

25:10.010 --> 25:13.030
[speaking Spanish]

25:18.890 --> 25:20.740
Mm-hmm.

25:20.790 --> 25:22.580
Um, sí... He wants to know the names

25:22.630 --> 25:25.250
of other tenants on the
floor in the past 12 months

25:25.300 --> 25:27.550
so a security team can
run background checks.

25:27.600 --> 25:31.280
Uh, I'm not at liberty to
give out that information.

25:31.330 --> 25:34.820
I'm sure that your client
would appreciate that.

25:34.870 --> 25:38.360
My client likes to decide
what he would appreciate.

25:41.279 --> 25:42.679
If you don't mind my asking,

25:42.680 --> 25:45.270
what kind of business is your client in?

25:45.320 --> 25:46.720
Hmm.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.140
[speaking Spanish]

25:50.190 --> 25:52.670
Construction, mainly.

25:52.720 --> 25:56.140
He needs to be here a few
months out of the year.

25:56.189 --> 25:57.589
He hates hotels.

25:57.590 --> 26:01.280
[chuckles] Construction, mainly.

26:01.330 --> 26:03.080
You know, other buildings we toured

26:03.130 --> 26:06.490
had no problem disclosing
names of previous tenants.

26:06.540 --> 26:08.990
The last one had a pool, too.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.720
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.460
Eastwood Apartment's confidentiality policy

26:13.510 --> 26:14.910
is very strict.

26:14.911 --> 26:16.079
Good for you.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.480
That's very commendable.

26:17.510 --> 26:19.300
But my client is ready to pay a year's rent

26:19.350 --> 26:22.400
for all three available
units on this floor by the end

26:22.450 --> 26:24.740
of the week... and in cash,

26:24.790 --> 26:29.610
but not unless he gets this information.

26:29.660 --> 26:31.380
I see.

26:31.430 --> 26:34.410
Let me talk to my boss
and I'll get back to you.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.680
I'll give you 24 hours.

27:02.220 --> 27:03.840
[exhales]

27:03.890 --> 27:06.810
It's gonna be a hell of a storm.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.560
Maybe God will send an ark

27:09.600 --> 27:12.950
to take His faithful
away to somewhere else.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.460
Amen, sister.

27:23.150 --> 27:25.930
So...

27:25.980 --> 27:30.900
you and Josh.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.740
Me and Josh what?

27:38.660 --> 27:40.150
Did you come up here to accuse me

27:40.200 --> 27:41.980
of cheating on your son?

27:43.570 --> 27:46.150
We both know there's no
PJ to cheat on anymore.

27:49.440 --> 27:52.060
In mediation, you made it very clear...

27:52.110 --> 27:55.090
I held the party line.

27:55.091 --> 27:56.479
I have to.

27:56.480 --> 27:59.100
Can't betray my husband in public.

28:04.250 --> 28:08.640
I'm on your side.

28:08.690 --> 28:12.080
You can't get Pernell to understand?

28:12.130 --> 28:15.050
[coughs] [laughs]

28:15.100 --> 28:17.720
I can't even get Pernell to eat.

28:21.270 --> 28:22.760
Be patient.

28:25.510 --> 28:29.500
He's gonna have to let PJ go eventually...

28:29.550 --> 28:32.800
[sighs] whether he wants to or not.

28:36.350 --> 28:40.440
None of us want to.

28:40.490 --> 28:42.710
He's already gone.

28:47.330 --> 28:50.180
If there is a "you and Josh"

28:50.230 --> 28:54.190
or a "you and anyone,"

28:54.240 --> 28:58.160
you have my blessing.

28:58.210 --> 29:00.330
There's none.

29:00.380 --> 29:01.930
You have my encouragement.

29:05.180 --> 29:06.700
Why are you telling me this?

29:06.750 --> 29:12.670
Because no one is tying you
to that fiasco down there.

29:12.720 --> 29:15.040
You're free, Jocelyn.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.310
Go find an ark.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.980
Get out of here. Go live your life.

29:29.170 --> 29:30.990
FEMALE VOICE ON TV: And
with a storm on its way,

29:31.040 --> 29:33.830
many of them are worried
about heavy rainfall,

29:33.880 --> 29:36.660
rising tides, and high winds.

29:36.710 --> 29:38.630
And places like the San Vicente harbor

29:38.680 --> 29:42.200
haven't updated their pilings for decades.

29:42.201 --> 29:43.549
So.

29:43.550 --> 29:44.789
We just passed the two-hour mark,

29:44.790 --> 29:45.959
if you're wondering.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.010
Here you go.
- [sighs] Thanks.

29:48.060 --> 29:49.710
Welcome.

29:49.760 --> 29:52.080
You don't have to stay.

29:52.130 --> 29:54.610
Well, gonna at least finish my coffee.

29:57.030 --> 30:01.190
I'm sorry I went off on
you like that earlier.

30:01.191 --> 30:02.499
I just, um...

30:02.500 --> 30:04.460
I have a friend who used to have a problem

30:04.510 --> 30:06.760
with drugs that I really care about

30:06.810 --> 30:10.300
and they're clean now,
praise God, but, um...

30:10.301 --> 30:11.649
[sighs] You're sensitive to it...

30:11.650 --> 30:13.600
- I get it.
- Yeah.

30:13.650 --> 30:15.050
I get it.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.640
Yeah.

30:18.690 --> 30:20.440
Um, Alicia.

30:20.441 --> 30:21.689
Hmm?

30:21.690 --> 30:23.089
I have your blood on my Jordans.

30:23.090 --> 30:24.490
Can't we just cut

30:24.530 --> 30:26.510
the "I have a friend" bullshit?

30:26.560 --> 30:29.150
You talking about Paul, right?

30:29.200 --> 30:30.850
No, no, not Paul.

30:30.900 --> 30:34.320
Please, I've seen the way
the two of you are together.

30:37.470 --> 30:39.290
The Reverend was an addict?

30:43.980 --> 30:46.670
You know what drug dealers are famous for?

30:46.720 --> 30:48.900
Discretion.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.240
He relapsed.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.580
Once, I think.

31:00.630 --> 31:02.310
But he won't even admit it to me.

31:04.270 --> 31:06.790
It's the lying that
really scares me, you know?

31:08.700 --> 31:13.860
Yeah. What's his drug?

31:13.861 --> 31:15.109
Meth.

31:15.110 --> 31:18.160
Meth? Shit.

31:23.250 --> 31:26.310
How do you know when someone's
not an addict anymore?

31:28.760 --> 31:30.840
Well, once you're a pickle,

31:30.890 --> 31:33.180
you can't go back to being a cucumber.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.280
I don't believe that.

31:37.400 --> 31:40.020
God transforms people.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.720
I hope that's true.

31:46.740 --> 31:50.000
[indistinct praying]

32:11.270 --> 32:12.920

32:20.810 --> 32:22.260
Thank you.

32:24.580 --> 32:27.430
[exhales deeply]

32:27.480 --> 32:30.340
Look at this.

32:30.390 --> 32:34.370
Look at everything
you're doing for your boy.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.820
Damn.

32:40.930 --> 32:44.420
I know you're trying to be a good man,

32:44.470 --> 32:49.390
trying to do the right thing,

32:49.440 --> 32:52.930
but you're all fucking up
everything else along the way.

32:59.980 --> 33:01.380
Bobo?

33:06.590 --> 33:08.040
Who cleans it up?

33:12.760 --> 33:14.710
You have no idea what I do,

33:14.760 --> 33:18.020
what I let someone do
to me in front of my son.

33:18.070 --> 33:19.470
My boy.

33:24.870 --> 33:28.490
But it's fine, right, Pernell?

33:32.080 --> 33:35.840
I'm gonna get that concrete pour.

33:35.890 --> 33:40.110
Brooks is gonna move in.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.640
And I'm gonna be the first black man

33:41.690 --> 33:44.910
with a statue in front of the city hall.

33:52.430 --> 33:53.830
