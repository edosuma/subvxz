00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:07.041 --> 00:08.674
"The sun shines during the day."

00:08.676 --> 00:10.876
Ms. Matthews will argue
the affirmative.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.644
Good morning, everybody.

00:12.646 --> 00:15.280
You know why people
say that in the morning?

00:17.385 --> 00:18.617
Paam!

00:20.354 --> 00:22.287
Nailed it.

00:22.289 --> 00:23.722
How can you possibly lose?

00:23.724 --> 00:25.290
Like this.

00:25.292 --> 00:27.393
First of all, let's understand
that day and night are

00:27.395 --> 00:28.894
merely words invented
by human beings

00:28.896 --> 00:31.964
to communicate simple conceptual
constructs apropos of nothing.

00:31.966 --> 00:33.198
Ooh!

00:36.303 --> 00:37.336
Apropos.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.338
Rawr.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.207
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.843
Anyway, science tells us
that the sun is always shining

00:44.845 --> 00:47.579
and what appears
to be day and night is
merely our angle of proximity

00:47.581 --> 00:50.582
at a particular time
to the Earth's revolution.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.219
And, for extra credit,
there's no such thing as time.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.287
Time!

00:57.058 --> 00:58.690
Our debate topic
therefore, is false.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.393
The sun does not just shine
during the day, it also shines
during the night,

01:01.395 --> 01:02.327
just not on us.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.796
I win.

01:05.733 --> 01:06.832
How do you win?

01:06.834 --> 01:08.567
Because I have high hopes.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.002
Because when
you believe passionately--

01:10.004 --> 01:13.072
And our debate winner
is Farkle Minkus!

01:14.408 --> 01:16.842
I don't understand.
I said what I believed.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.043
How could that be wrong?

01:18.045 --> 01:21.413
There's no wrong, Riley.
But there are rules to a debate.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.748
Okay, who cares
about the rules

01:22.750 --> 01:24.950
when we know that the sun
shines during the day?

01:24.952 --> 01:26.552
That's interesting, isn't it?

01:26.554 --> 01:29.755
How often do we get so lost
in what we think,

01:29.757 --> 01:32.758
that we refuse to listen
to what the other side
has to say, huh?

01:32.760 --> 01:35.861
You guys know why
we debate in history class?

01:35.863 --> 01:39.131
History teaches us
that most wars start

01:39.133 --> 01:41.033
because we don't listen
to the other point of view.

01:41.035 --> 01:43.202
I'm not trying to start a war.

01:43.204 --> 01:46.205
I just think it's okay
to feel strongly about
what you believe in.

01:46.207 --> 01:49.108
Riley, it's not enough
to go through life

01:49.110 --> 01:51.443
without considering
the other point of view.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.245
Oh, I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.147
The sun was in my ears.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.051
-Riley.
-Cory.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.652
Here we go.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.454
I love this class so much.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.158
Being passionate
about what you believe in

02:06.160 --> 02:07.326
is the only way to live.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.861
I don't need your facts,

02:08.862 --> 02:10.395
and I certainly don't need
your points of view.

02:10.397 --> 02:12.664
-Switch.
-Huh?

02:12.666 --> 02:14.766
Switch sides.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.136
Argue the other side. Farkle?

02:18.272 --> 02:19.505
The sun shines
during the day.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.073
You know how I know?

02:21.075 --> 02:24.309
Poom!
Hey!

02:24.311 --> 02:27.513
POOM is my acronym
for "Polar oscillation
in orbital motion."

02:27.515 --> 02:28.847
Is it hot in here?

02:28.849 --> 02:31.450
It's hot in here, right?
What's happening?

02:31.452 --> 02:34.086
Farkle, what do
you really believe?

02:34.088 --> 02:36.522
The sun shines all the time.
When we see it, it's day.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.323
So for us the sun
shines during the day.

02:38.325 --> 02:42.127
How do we know
what you really believe if you
can switch sides that easily?

02:42.129 --> 02:43.812
I'm not changing
what I believe.

02:43.813 --> 02:45.496
But a good debater needs
to be able to argue both sides.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.432
Right. And as you
continue to grow,

02:47.434 --> 02:51.670
you'll find a benefit
to understanding the other
side of an argument.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.306
Because if you know
what you're up against,
you'll be ready for it.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.341
Oh, I don't think
I'll need to be ready

02:56.343 --> 02:59.444
to argue something
as simple as whether
the sun is out or not.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.047
Are people
naturally good or evil?

03:02.049 --> 03:03.115
Good.

03:03.117 --> 03:05.484
All of you will argue good.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.786
Only one of you
will argue the other side.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.521
Ms. Matthews...

03:09.523 --> 03:11.890
You wouldn't dare.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.527
You will make
the case for evil.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.697
(bell rings)

03:25.539 --> 03:28.006
Boy, you have killed us all.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.875
Yes. Yes, I have.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.943
Let's go.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.216
How could people
possibly be evil?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.552
I don't know, man.

we do this a little at a time.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.452
Why?

04:51.992 --> 04:53.825
Close it.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.628
You did great. Lollipop?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.397
May I have a red one, please?

05:07.508 --> 05:09.441
Okay, so I wasn't prepared.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.843
But I'm glad you started out
with the worst thing possible.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.513
You know what? You just tell me
when to stop. Okay?

05:16.583 --> 05:17.816
Stop.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.017
Heh! Heh! Heh!

05:19.953 --> 05:21.019
Go.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.691
Please tell me, that is
the worst thing possible.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.826
Yep, it is. There's nothing
worse than that.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.329
I don't want to live
in a world like this!

05:35.602 --> 05:38.670
Riley, you're wearing
a wool sweater.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.209
Aah!

05:47.981 --> 05:49.614
Oh, get off!

05:53.220 --> 05:56.121
It's looking at you.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.626
Aah! Get it off of me!

06:05.699 --> 06:07.733
That's the last time
I ever loan you anything!

06:09.536 --> 06:11.737
Okay. What else ya got?

06:11.739 --> 06:13.238
You know what?
How 'bout we just start

06:13.240 --> 06:15.741
with a small, simple,
little place like New York City.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.709
Let's see what's happening
in our own backyard.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.414
Hi, guys.

06:24.318 --> 06:25.584
That's not nice.

06:29.923 --> 06:33.558
Okay. Today's local item...
"No Day at the Beach."

06:33.560 --> 06:35.660
What's that?

06:35.662 --> 06:38.263
"New York City beaches
are overrun with trash.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.766
"Bottles, cans, wrappers
litter our beaches

06:40.768 --> 06:42.434
"to the point where
wildlife is endangered

06:42.436 --> 06:44.369
and people
no longer go barefoot."

06:44.371 --> 06:46.605
But I like the sand
between my toes.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.311
Don't you hate it
when people overreact?

07:00.053 --> 07:02.287
You and me, the beach.
How 'bout it?

07:02.289 --> 07:04.389
-You mean this weekend?
-I mean now.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.590
The beach needs us, Mommy.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.592
We need to help
clean up the trash.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.760
How do you know about that?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.629
I'm a world citizen.

07:12.466 --> 07:16.435
Okay. You and me,
the beach, tomorrow morning.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.236
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

07:18.238 --> 07:20.272
Those are words.
Raise my allowance.

07:21.375 --> 07:22.574
(laughing)

07:22.576 --> 07:24.042
Come here,
you world citizen.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.646
So, how do you feel?

07:27.648 --> 07:29.414
I feel transformed.

07:29.416 --> 07:32.784
Evil's gooey tentacles
have squeezed my pure heart.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.321
But I'll never believe
that people aren't good.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.823
You know how I pass
the newsstands

07:37.825 --> 07:39.791
and the headlines are screaming
right at you in the face?

07:39.793 --> 07:42.461
I look at
the pretty magazines.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.130
But do you ever look
at the news?

07:45.132 --> 07:47.132
Mm. I know what's trending.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.634
I know what's up
with what's up.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.003
Hmm. So you look
at the news every day?

07:52.005 --> 07:54.806
Hmm, not every day, no.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.241
Do you look
at the news any day?

07:56.243 --> 07:59.077
Hmm... not any day, no.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.947
Okay.

08:01.949 --> 08:06.651
How about we just look
at the headlines from today.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.888
(keyboard clacking)

08:15.028 --> 08:17.796
Mm... This is now?

08:17.798 --> 08:19.231
Right now.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.133
(keyboard clacks)

08:22.135 --> 08:24.369
Where is this?

08:24.371 --> 08:26.104
This is our world.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.373
(keyboard clacks)

08:30.878 --> 08:32.544
Oh, my gosh.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.187
Do you guys know
what goes on out there?

08:44.157 --> 08:46.525
Climate change, poverty, war?

08:46.527 --> 08:49.294
-Yeah.
-This is the way
that the world is?

08:49.296 --> 08:50.695
We try to keep it
from you.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.163
You're all in on it?

08:52.165 --> 08:54.399
-The Riley Committee.
-I pay dues.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.868
-There are no dues--
-Quiet.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.537
It's worth it anyway.
I think it's wonderful

08:58.539 --> 09:00.639
to have somebody
among us who looks
for the good in everything.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.307
-Well, that's over.
-Why?

09:02.309 --> 09:05.744
Because I've seen things.
I'm not Simple Riley anymore.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.679
Riley, don't let
reality change you.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.748
Yeah, reality's only as powerful
as you let it be.

09:09.750 --> 09:13.251
Sometimes you can create
your own reality.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.754
Right, me and Lucas
in Hawaii?

09:17.057 --> 09:19.724
Smackle,
inside-your-head voice.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.765
Knowing things changes you.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.567
I'm supposed to argue
that people are evil,

09:28.569 --> 09:29.768
and now I can.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.202
I have started my research,

09:31.204 --> 09:32.871
and I will continue
down this dark journey

09:32.873 --> 09:37.375
that I can only call,
"Riley Matthews: evil person."

09:37.377 --> 09:39.744
(snickering)

09:39.746 --> 09:41.580
What, you guys don't think
I could be bad?

09:41.582 --> 09:45.917
Um, okay. Do the worst thing
that you can think of right now.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.986
Hi, to everybody but you!

09:51.792 --> 09:53.758
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay, Riley.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.260
Guys, we're gonna be fine.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.196
My cookie came.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.564
Cookie day!

09:59.566 --> 10:00.966
Everyone say it!

10:00.968 --> 10:02.233
All: Cookie day.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.969
What the--

10:03.971 --> 10:06.972
I hold in my hand one
Grandma Gandy cookie.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.608
Now Grandma Gandy could
send me a whole batch,

10:09.610 --> 10:12.544
but she doesn't 'cause
then she knows I wouldn't
appreciate it as much.

10:12.546 --> 10:13.979
Looks like she's right.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.947
I mean, grandma says that
there's value in just one thing,

10:15.949 --> 10:18.883
that you appreciate it more
because there's just one.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.986
Maybe so,
because when I look at this,

10:20.988 --> 10:22.220
I think about her
making it for me,

10:22.222 --> 10:23.822
and her thinking about me
the whole time.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.957
That's a good thing
she does, Riley.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.127
Doesn't Grandma Gandy seem
like a good person?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.496
My grandma's getting
pretty old now.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.365
This could be the last cookie
I'm ever gonna get.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.935
-Riley!
-Are you kidding me?

10:36.937 --> 10:37.969
Okay, that was bad.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.672
Bad? What could she do
worse than that?

10:40.674 --> 10:42.374
This cookie is only okay.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.811
(whimpers)

10:51.918 --> 10:53.685
I'm evil now.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.186
Yeah, you're
my new dark leader.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.489
What's next?
That heavy metal?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.925
What's next
is apologizing to Zay.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.294
The evil
don't apologize, Maya.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.130
And now I have to tell
you something,

11:05.132 --> 11:06.965
and it's gonna shake
you up real good.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.000
Riley, your five evil
minutes are up. Okay?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.869
-Snap out of it.
-Maya...

11:10.871 --> 11:13.505
there is part of me
that liked it.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.541
Seeing that look
on everybody's face...

11:16.543 --> 11:18.877
there was a part
of me that liked it.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.145
You shook?

11:20.147 --> 11:22.147
I'm a little shook.

11:22.149 --> 11:25.050
Riles, we all have that, okay?
That's how we're made.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.018
We all have a little angel
and a little devil

11:27.020 --> 11:28.553
that sit on our shoulders
and try to win us over.

11:28.555 --> 11:31.356
-I have a devil?
-Even you.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.325
She's wearing a red,
sparkly halter top.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.860
What's her name?

11:35.862 --> 11:37.395
Sassy Haltertop.

11:37.397 --> 11:41.032
Mine's Stabby McGee.
We should get 'em together.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.169
Riley, apologize.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.038
We came over to give you
the chance to apologize.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.973
Came in through the front door
'cause I'm wearing a skirt.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.442
Didn't know it was window day.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.878
We know you feel awful
about what you did.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.414
Doesn't look like
she feels awful.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.217
Would you just say
you're sorry?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.019
-I can't.
-Why?

12:01.021 --> 12:02.420
It wouldn't be honest.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.023
-You ate my cookie, man!
-And I liked doing it, okay?

12:05.025 --> 12:06.991
I've never done
anything like that before

12:06.993 --> 12:08.993
and I would never do
anything to hurt anybody,

12:08.995 --> 12:12.097
but something red and sparkly
inside of me liked it.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.966
Well, okay for you, then.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.939
Riley, please apologize.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.045
-I'm going through
the front door--
-Yeah, skirt.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.246
Yes. Skirt.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.785
Maya, I don't get it.

12:33.787 --> 12:36.020
I've seen headlines now.
I know things now.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.355
Why is this such a big deal?

12:37.357 --> 12:39.290
Because...

12:40.694 --> 12:41.626
Because you see that door?

12:45.132 --> 12:47.065
When it's shut, it's shut.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.600
I can pull on it
as hard as I can,

12:48.602 --> 12:50.068
it doesn't open.

12:50.070 --> 12:54.506
But just the slightest crack...
throws the door wide open.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.609
You opened the door, Riles.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.445
And the first bad thing
makes it easier to do
the next bad thing.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.914
I think I already did
the next bad thing.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.749
What'd you do?

13:04.751 --> 13:07.085
I didn't give Two Shoes Louie
a dollar today.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.154
What?! You love
Two Shoes Louie.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.822
You give him a dollar
whenever you see him.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.590
You go,
"Here you go, Two Shoes Louie."

13:12.592 --> 13:14.676
And he goes,
"Thanks, Bright Eyes.

13:14.677 --> 13:16.761
Now I'm one dollar closer
to getting my new pair
of matching shoes."

13:16.763 --> 13:20.064
But, Maya, he asked
for two dollars today.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.766
And tomorrow is
spaghetti and hot dog day,

13:21.768 --> 13:23.301
and I want me some of that.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.170
So you didn't give
him anything?

13:25.172 --> 13:29.240
No, Maya, an extra dollar wasn't
going to change anything, okay?

13:29.242 --> 13:31.142
And besides, it's a scam.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.012
-What?
-Yes, it's a scam, okay?

13:34.014 --> 13:35.580
We don't know
what he does with that money.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.016
Riley, it's possible
he's saving up
for a new pair of shoes.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.151
Or it's possible
people are evil.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.755
Okay, this is all
just to prepare you for
the debate though, right?

13:43.757 --> 13:46.991
Yes. And life.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.441
Nice breakfast.
You making good choices?

14:03.443 --> 14:05.376
-Nope.
-Why not?

14:05.378 --> 14:10.448
Because I'm inherently evil
and I'm out of control.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.218
Well, pay attention,
my evil darling,

14:13.220 --> 14:15.787
because I have spent my
entire life meeting the world,

14:15.789 --> 14:18.556
and I know something about it.

14:18.558 --> 14:23.127
Riley, you get this cast
of characters in life, okay?

14:23.129 --> 14:25.163
You get friends
and you get family,

14:25.165 --> 14:27.031
and they help you
make it through the day.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.634
But the world is a character
in your life, too.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.169
And how it treats you

14:31.171 --> 14:33.338
has everything to do
with how you treat it.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.240
It teaches me good lessons.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.009
-That'll stop.
-Why?

14:38.011 --> 14:41.646
People who are evil
don't believe those lessons
anymore, Riley.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.648
They stop thinking the world
has anything to teach them.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.820
What if being evil
is more fun than being good?

14:48.822 --> 14:52.223
What if being evil
changes your understanding
of what fun is?

14:55.095 --> 14:56.928
We got up at four o'clock!

14:56.930 --> 15:00.732
Yup. Auggie and I had
a little beach adventure
this morning.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.033
What is all of this?

15:02.035 --> 15:04.302
-I got it.
-Good. Tired. Four o'clock.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.704
Why'd you get up
so early, Bubba?

15:06.706 --> 15:09.240
I wanted to help clean up
all the trash.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.508
Are you off your rocker?

15:10.510 --> 15:12.877
No, I am
on my rocker, Riley.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.113
Did you know that there's
so much trash at the beach

15:15.115 --> 15:17.415
that people can't even
go barefoot in the sand

15:17.417 --> 15:19.684
because they might step
on something bad?

15:19.686 --> 15:21.252
Well, how much did you pick up?

15:21.254 --> 15:22.787
I cleaned up
a little area.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.056
What good is that going to do?

15:25.058 --> 15:28.226
I found out that you can't
clean up the whole beach, man.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.028
But I did my part.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.031
Auggie, do you really think that
what you did means anything?

15:33.033 --> 15:34.565
Riley!

15:34.567 --> 15:36.200
Mom, did we waste our time?

15:36.202 --> 15:39.137
No. We didn't.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.205
There's a story that I know.

15:41.207 --> 15:44.142
Sometimes starfish
wash up on the beach,

15:44.144 --> 15:46.444
miles and miles of starfish.

15:46.446 --> 15:50.114
And the sun rises
and it dries them out
and then they die.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.116
So a little boy picks one up,

15:52.118 --> 15:54.252
and he throws it
back into the water.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.287
And someone
standing there says,

15:56.289 --> 15:57.655
"What do you think
that's gonna do?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.257
"There's too many
of them to pick up.

15:59.259 --> 16:02.060
Do you really think
you made a difference?"

16:02.062 --> 16:03.962
And the little boy says,

16:03.964 --> 16:06.364
"I made a difference
to that one."

16:07.634 --> 16:09.767
So... I did good?

16:09.769 --> 16:13.371
So you did very good.

16:21.114 --> 16:24.115
So, what did you find out?

16:24.117 --> 16:26.985
Are people good,
or evil, or what?

16:26.987 --> 16:28.753
We miss Riley.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.289
That's your opening statement?

16:31.291 --> 16:33.791
Yes, and it's genius.

16:33.793 --> 16:34.826
Why is that?

16:34.828 --> 16:36.427
Because the change
in Riley's behavior

16:36.429 --> 16:37.862
has changed
the world we live in.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.864
And if we didn't notice
the change, it would mean

16:39.866 --> 16:42.567
we are not possessed of
a natural goodness that helps us
recognize it in others.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.004
I was gonna say that.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.473
Zay, what have you found out?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.575
I noticed she ate my cookie.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.311
Do you forgive her for that?

16:53.313 --> 16:54.812
No.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.981
And do you not forgive her
because you're an evil person?

16:56.983 --> 16:59.217
No. I do not forgive her
because I'm a good person

16:59.219 --> 17:00.752
who lost a good cookie.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.988
Well, do you think you
could ever forgive her?

17:03.990 --> 17:06.324
It's possible I might
forgive her in time.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.458
Why do you think that is?

17:07.460 --> 17:08.726
'Cause I was raised right.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.194
I don't know
who raised her.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.398
Okay. Why do you think
you might forgive her?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.833
Because I know what she did
isn't who she is.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.535
Sometimes good people
do bad things.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.038
Thank you.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.241
So, can I hear
from the other side?

17:23.243 --> 17:28.746
This is a world of poverty,
hunger, and climate change.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.681
And we know it,

17:30.683 --> 17:32.417
and we tolerate it,

17:32.419 --> 17:34.352
and we have not changed it.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.020
So if the world creates
opportunities for us

17:36.022 --> 17:40.024
to do something good
or something evil every day,

17:40.026 --> 17:44.729
and that world is full
of poverty, hunger, and war...

17:44.731 --> 17:48.866
then doesn't
the state of the world
answer the question?

17:48.868 --> 17:51.569
Doesn't it prove
that the world is evil?

17:54.007 --> 17:56.441
That we are evil?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.045
You win, Riley.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.847
Oh, I didn't want to.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.283
Excellent debate,
Ms. Matthews.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.885
It was, Riley.
You beat us.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.455
So, that's it?
People are evil?

18:10.457 --> 18:13.624
Well, let's find out.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.426
Switch sides.

18:21.434 --> 18:26.938
This is a world where children
wake up at 4:00 in the morning
to save starfish

18:26.940 --> 18:30.374
because something in them knows
that it's the right thing to do.

18:30.376 --> 18:34.612
Why do we lose that?
Where does that go?

18:34.614 --> 18:37.648
We are born with the choice
of good or evil inside of us

18:37.650 --> 18:41.919
and as much fun as it was
yesterday to do something bad,

18:41.921 --> 18:44.489
now it's today, and I know

18:44.491 --> 18:47.425
that doing a bad thing
isn't fun at all.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.327
She feels bad, man.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.095
I don't care.
I want my cookie back.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.331
Zay, I feel terrible.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.299
But I know that
you're going to forgive me.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.468
I know that
you're a good person.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.672
(scoffs)
Possibly. In time.
In a thousand years.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.575
Now. I am asking
for you forgiveness now.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.945
No.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.347
So I wrote this cookie song.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.781
I forgive you!

19:10.783 --> 19:12.416
Please, really forgive me.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.519
Ugh, why?

19:14.521 --> 19:16.354
There are two voices in us.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.657
Both sides know
how to present their point.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.359
Which voice wins?

19:21.361 --> 19:24.328
That is the only
debate that matters.

19:24.330 --> 19:28.366
That's the only reason
the sun shines in
the middle of the night.

19:28.368 --> 19:32.203
There is good
and there is evil.

19:34.107 --> 19:36.474
I found that if you choose good,

19:36.476 --> 19:38.709
the world is
more than willing
to help you out.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.546
Zay, this is the fault
of Sassy Haltertop.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.115
She sits on my shoulder
and she told me
to do a bad thing.

19:44.117 --> 19:46.684
Yeah, I think everyone has that,
but why did you listen?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.886
Because I never did before.

19:48.888 --> 19:52.623
There are two sides.
You consider both,

19:52.625 --> 19:54.525
and you decide who you are.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.028
Look, Riley, I know
who sits on your other shoulder,

19:57.030 --> 19:59.897
and Sassy Haltertop doesn't
stand a chance against you.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.666
So, you forgive me?

20:01.668 --> 20:03.201
Yes, I do.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.969
Because I know
who you really are.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.971
So I forgive you right now.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.574
Thank you.

Two Shoes Louie.

20:37.070 --> 20:41.072
Maya, Papaya! Bright Eyes!

20:41.074 --> 20:45.776
Hi. I'm really sorry
that I didn't give you
the two dollars the other day.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.547
But I brought you
spaghetti and hot dogs.

20:49.549 --> 20:53.217
I love spaghetti and hot dogs.

20:53.219 --> 20:57.622
Listen, Bright Eyes,
I asked you for two dollars

20:57.624 --> 21:03.527
because I was only two dollars
away from being able to afford
a pair of matching shoes.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.896
-You were?
-Yeah.

21:05.898 --> 21:10.134
And I wanted it to be you
that gave it to me.

21:10.136 --> 21:13.938
But it wasn't you.
It was somebody
that I didn't know,

21:13.940 --> 21:17.275
whose eyes
didn't shine at all...

21:18.745 --> 21:21.145
who didn't even look at me.

21:21.147 --> 21:23.381
But you're still wearing
your same different shoes.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.516
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

21:27.487 --> 21:30.921
So, uh, would you take
this two dollars?

21:30.923 --> 21:33.157
Oh, come on, take it.
Come on.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.326
(chuckling) Here.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.628
Nice seeing you.
You too, Papaya.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.838
Bright Eyes!

21:50.643 --> 21:52.243
Do you have two dollars?

21:52.245 --> 21:55.046
Hmm. Well, I believe I do.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.216
I wanted it to be you.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.553
You're a good man,
Two Shoes Louie.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.690
I'm trying every day.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.333
Me too.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.667
Me too.
