He's been here.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.400
Picking up loads
of trace signatures.

00:23.400 --> 00:28.800
- Fred.
- Hair follicles, enzymes and something--

00:28.800 --> 00:31.400
Blood. But it's not his.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.300
It's--

00:35.600 --> 00:39.300
- Oh, God.
- I think God is out at the moment.

00:39.300 --> 00:43.200
Why would Greenway do this?
It was just a stupid racketeering charge.

00:43.400 --> 00:46.400
I told him we'd get him off with probation
so long as he shut down operations.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.400
He's a Wolfram and Hart client--
our client.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.700
Oh, and he's evil.
What are the odds?

00:52.700 --> 00:57.300
- What do we do now?
- Now I find Greenway, and I kill every inch of him.

00:57.300 --> 01:01.300
<i>You won't.</i>
<i>Five holy women.</i>

01:01.300 --> 01:05.099
This wasn't random. It's ritual.
He's jumped dimensions.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.700
- What?
- Also, not shockingly,
our client practices black arts.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.500
He's escaped through
a pan-dimensional doorway...

01:12.500 --> 01:14.800
disappeared into any one
of infinite universes.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.800
- Fred?
- My equipment's not calibrated...

01:17.800 --> 01:19.900
<i>to track anything</i>
<i>out of this dimension.</i>

01:19.900 --> 01:22.700
<i>- Even if such a thing was possible,</i>
<i>it would take months or maybe years.</i>
- That's it.

01:22.700 --> 01:27.000
But probably months,
or maybe weeks, if I really pushed.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.300
- I can't do this anymore.
- [ Gunn ] Do what?

01:29.300 --> 01:32.200
Any of this. Living with it.
Running Wolfram and Hart.

01:34.900 --> 01:37.300

<i>I'm resigning.</i>

02:54.100 --> 02:56.500
Gee, seems like a ripe topic
for discussion to me.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.600
What happened last night was tragic.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.600
- It's a terrible setback, but--
- Setback, Wes?

03:02.600 --> 03:05.500
<i>Status quo. Evil wins...</i>

03:05.500 --> 03:09.300
'cause instead of just wiping it out,
we negotiate with it--

03:09.300 --> 03:11.600
or worse, for it.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.600
Angel, we're doing the best we can.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.800
It's not that you guys aren't doing your jobs.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.800
It's that we shouldn't be doing these jobs
in the first place-- or I shouldn't.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.600
Let's say we've all had a bellyful.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.100
<i>Any thought about what'd happen to us</i>
<i>if we tried to say bye-bye?</i>

03:25.100 --> 03:27.100
The ramifications, I mean.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.400
Think the senior partners are gonna let us
breeze on out the front door?

03:29.400 --> 03:32.300
- You're saying we're trapped?
- I'm saying we knew what we were gettin' into...

03:32.300 --> 03:34.400
when we signed up for this gig.

03:34.400 --> 03:38.200
<i>Let's not start pretending that this</i>
<i>was some lease with an option to buy.</i>

03:38.600 --> 03:40.600
Gunn, do you really think they won't let us out?

03:40.600 --> 03:43.100
<i>Or is it that you just don't want to leave?</i>

03:43.100 --> 03:46.400
Okay. Maybe I don't.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.700
It's 'cause I believe in what we're doin'.
We made the right call.

03:49.700 --> 03:53.700
And I'm sure that legal-brain upgrade
they gave you has got nothin' to do with--

03:53.800 --> 03:56.500
We all got somethin' out of this.

<i>[ Phone Rings ]</i>

04:01.800 --> 04:03.600
Yeah. It's Angel.

What?

04:08.500 --> 04:10.400
What is it?

04:12.500 --> 04:15.000
It's Cordelia.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.500
- Cordelia?
<i>- [ Cordelia ] Yeah.</i>

04:26.500 --> 04:28.600
That chick's in rough shape.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.700
You'd think they'd give
Miss One-foot-in-the-grave a private room.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.500
Which brings me to-- Hey!

04:34.500 --> 04:38.400
Couldn't you stick me someplace that smells
a little less like ammonia-soaked death?

04:38.700 --> 04:40.600
Ahh!

04:43.600 --> 04:47.400
- Cordy.
- Yeah. It's me.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.700
- [ Laughing ]
- It's extraordinary.

04:54.700 --> 04:57.900
You're-- You look--

04:57.900 --> 05:01.000
- I don't want to say really hot, but--
- Oh, yes, you do.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.600
I'm a vision of hotliness.
And how weird is that? Uh! Mystical comas.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.900
You know, if you can stand the horror of
a higher power hijacking your mind and body...

05:08.900 --> 05:11.200
so that it can give birth to itself?

05:11.200 --> 05:13.600
- Really recommend 'em.
- You remember?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.700
Last year?

05:15.700 --> 05:20.900
Yeah. I remember everything,
pretty much...

05:20.900 --> 05:24.500
at least until I slipped into slumberland.

05:24.500 --> 05:28.000
Maternal instincts aside,
I hope you kicked its ass for me.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.900
- Is everybody all right?
- Yeah.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.600
- Uh, great. We're all--
- Yes, super.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.900
Super, yes. Super.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.800
- Hey, why don't we get you outta here?
- Ahh! I love that plan.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.400
I hope you brought me some clothes, 'cause--
Damn.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.900
- Oh. Well, we-- we weren't expecting--
- We could stop and buy some.

05:49.900 --> 05:53.300
Ooh! Great! Shopping! Ha-ha!

05:53.300 --> 05:56.500
I love that idea, 'cause, you know,
I'm not so ready to go back to the hotel yet.

Uh, nothing scary popping out at you.

-Just regular people going about--
- Aah!

06:28.700 --> 06:31.100
[ Man ] Yeah. I found the scamp
hiding in one of the copiers, you know?

<i>Livin'on nothin'but toner fluid.</i>
<i>Can you beat that?</i>

06:34.000 --> 06:37.800
The slave, I mean. I assume the archduke
is gonna beat him and all that?

06:37.800 --> 06:39.700
That's-- Heh! Nothing.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.100
- Hey, do you want to see my office?
- Yeah.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.100
- Lorne!
- Are you huggable?

06:45.100 --> 06:47.400
It is so good to see--

06:47.400 --> 06:50.800
Oh, my God. Gunn?
You have hair.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.700
Oh. Heh! Yeah.
What'd you think, I was prematurely bald?

06:55.900 --> 06:58.700
- I wasn't.
- [ Cordelia Laughing ]

- What do you mean, who? Connor. Isn't he--

<i>- Angel, where's your--</i>
- [ Squealing ] Oh, my God!

07:12.400 --> 07:14.500
Aah!

07:14.500 --> 07:16.600
I can't believe you're here!

07:16.600 --> 07:19.300
Likewise, especially since the last time
I saw you, you tried to kill me.

07:19.300 --> 07:23.600
Oh, Harmony, she's--
Actually, sh-- she's my secretary.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.900
Oh. Well, things just keep
getting better and better.

07:29.900 --> 07:33.000
I know!
You and me, together again.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.400
So, how was the coma?

07:35.400 --> 07:37.700
Uh, Harmony, I think Cordy's had
enough excitement for the day.

07:37.700 --> 07:40.300
Why don't you--
Why doesn't everybody get back to work?

07:40.300 --> 07:42.300
- Great to see you.
- Bye.

07:42.300 --> 07:45.000
- [ Whispers ] We'll talk later.
- Hey, listen, crumb cake.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.700
When you're ready to splash back into
that acting pool,just say the word.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.500
- I'll have you lunching with Colin Farrell like that.
- [ Snaps Fingers ]

07:50.500 --> 07:55.600

- Cordy, I know there's a lot to take in,
a lot of changes.

But I promise you--
things here are workin' out.

07:59.300 --> 08:02.800
- Really?
- Yeah!

08:02.800 --> 08:04.800
With these resources...

there's nothin' we can't do,
no one we can't save.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.600
Except maybe yourself.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.800
What?

08:12.800 --> 08:17.100
I had a vision...
from the you-know-what That Be.

08:17.100 --> 08:20.900
That's what woke me up.
And you know something?

08:21.200 --> 08:24.200
When higher powers send you coma visions,
you better pay attention.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.600
<i>What'd you see?</i>

08:28.600 --> 08:31.700
You, in trouble.

Also...

08:34.000 --> 08:36.500
these weird symbols--

08:36.500 --> 08:38.700
glyphs, I guess--

08:38.700 --> 08:40.900
on a wall...

08:40.900 --> 08:42.799
and on flesh.

08:44.100 --> 08:48.600
A tattoo,
and there's a woman behind you.

08:48.600 --> 08:52.500
- You saw a woman in your vision?
- No, lunkhead, right now. Behind you.

08:55.100 --> 08:58.500
You weren't home upstairs. Didn't think
you'd mind me using your private elevator.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.700
Eve, I mind you breathing.
Get out.

09:00.700 --> 09:05.200
Yeah. Sure. Except I'm here
to convey the partners' concern.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.600
Little issue of you letting a client
skip out of our dimension.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.700
<i>The dead nuns we can deal with...</i>

09:10.700 --> 09:14.200
but the firm's out
1 0 million in bail costs.

09:14.200 --> 09:19.300
I ask you-- is that any way to run a business?
Who's your friend, Angel?

09:21.900 --> 09:24.300
I'm Cordelia Chase.

09:24.300 --> 09:27.400
- Oh. My name is--
- I didn't ask.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.400
Right.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.300
Cordelia Chase.

09:35.300 --> 09:38.700
Oh, yeah. Angel talked a lot
about you... at first.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.600
I thought I told Security
not to let you in this building.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.900
Sweetie, I'm liaison
to the senior partners.

09:43.900 --> 09:47.900
You honestly think you have any control
over my comings and goings?

09:47.900 --> 09:53.600
Well, maybe not my goings, but you did have
a way with my comings at the Halloween party.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.800
So you two are groin buddies?

09:56.800 --> 09:59.900
- And I thought Darla was rock bottom.
- We're not--

09:59.900 --> 10:03.100

Just... once.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.200
<i>There were special circumstances.</i>

10:05.200 --> 10:07.300

We'll talk business later, big guy.
I'll let you two catch up.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.600
And I'll let you walk out of here
with your head still attached to your body.

10:15.300 --> 10:18.500
Harmony, I want Security keeping tabs
on Eve while she's in the building.

10:18.500 --> 10:22.500
- Got it, bossy.
- That's the kind of person
you do business with now.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.900
Angel, do you realize what's happening?
You've made a deal with the devil.

10:25.900 --> 10:29.900
Oh, come on, Cordy.
You're being a little overdramatic. It's not that--

10:29.900 --> 10:33.100
I gotta go. Everything's in place.
I'll draw up the paperwork.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.300

Come on. Is that any way

11:15.400 --> 11:19.300
Just a little concerned about you.
You haven't been out in the field lately.
