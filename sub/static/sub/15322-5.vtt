WEBVTT

00:46.964 --> 00:48.420
Oh, God.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.967
You all right?!

00:51.009 --> 00:52.840
Hey! You okay?

00:54.221 --> 00:56.837
Hey!

01:14.032 --> 01:15.613
Who's there?

01:52.821 --> 01:56.063
Joe?

02:11.923 --> 02:15.131
Jesus,Joe.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.088
Did I scare ya?

02:19.723 --> 02:21.588
Did you go out?

02:21.683 --> 02:23.423
You left in the middle
of the night

02:23.518 --> 02:24.428
and didn't tell me.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.896
I had things to take care of.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.097
Kallie called.
I missed it.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.515
I was sleeping.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.517
I'm, like,
for-real worried now.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.985
You just said
that she called you.

02:36.031 --> 02:39.740
Yeah, but she's never been gone
for this long.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.747
You just come running
the second that woman says so.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.158
I hate that.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.951
"That woman"?

02:52.506 --> 02:53.746
Come on, Danette.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.131
I got to go to work
just like every day.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.417
Same soup, just reheated.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.420
You think she's okay?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.506
She is, right?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.132
Yeah.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.520
Of course she is.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.227
She's gonna come back
eventuaHy.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.354
Don't even worry about it.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.528
Mm.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.902
So, come on,
where you really going?

03:20.992 --> 03:23.574
Don't go, please?

03:25.664 --> 03:27.450
I'll be in touch.

03:36.508 --> 03:40.000
So, Joe Mills listed your place
as a permanent residence

03:40.011 --> 03:42.798
on a Medicaid application
in '06.

03:42.848 --> 03:48.013
And then again
for Workman's Comp in 2011.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.178
First and last known addies
is your crib.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.931
So it stands to reason...

03:53.984 --> 03:56.851
you just might know the guy.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.942
What somebody put
on some form years ago

04:00.991 --> 04:03.198
has got nothing to do with me.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.359
Sorry.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.449
See, I've been doing this
for a spell, Mama.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.700
And, see, we're at the point

04:09.791 --> 04:11.247
where I tell
whoever's wearing orange

04:11.293 --> 04:14.535
that now's the time
to be truly selfish.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.204
'Cause you need to know
that whoever you're protecting

04:17.257 --> 04:18.497
is damn sure gonna be selfish

04:18.550 --> 04:20.882
once you and him
are rocking matching outfits.

04:35.233 --> 04:39.977
Now you're going
all Nalgene Falls on Joe.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.980
It's too bad he likes 'em
in pampers.

04:50.207 --> 04:53.244
He isn't your lover.
He's your boy.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.205
He's your son.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.630
Isn't he?

05:04.179 --> 05:06.921
So maybe you called your son
when you got thrown in here.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.385
You leave Joey alone.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.346
And maybe your sweet little boy
would give his old ma

05:12.395 --> 05:13.384
a helping hand.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.224
You leave my boy alone!

05:15.273 --> 05:17.730
You're hurting your boy.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.233
You're not helping him.

05:20.278 --> 05:24.021
You can't protect him.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.274
Not anymore.
Not from this.

05:27.285 --> 05:31.244
You don't know him.

05:31.248 --> 05:35.537
Nobody else knows him
like I do.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.752
You see,

05:38.797 --> 05:41.288
he's...

05:41.299 --> 05:43.164
a young soul.

05:43.218 --> 05:46.005
That's why all those kids
love him.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.761
They-- they love
being around him.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.131
They know
he wouldn't hurt them.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.299
He's a good boy.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.512
He is such a--

06:01.695 --> 06:03.731
Here you go.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.741
What is it?

06:09.786 --> 06:13.825
What are you doing?

06:15.584 --> 06:16.994
Where's Joe Mills?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.749
What?
I don't know.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.130
- This is a search warrant enter your
premises. - Hey, you can't just come--

06:21.172 --> 06:22.423
- Go ahead.
- Joe's not here.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.006
We know that his mother called
him here twice from jail.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.040
Where is he?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.174
I don't know.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.214
Did you know that it was
your boyfriend's voice

06:29.264 --> 06:30.629
on that porn video with Kallie?

06:30.682 --> 06:32.798
Joe Mills made
that video and others.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.341
That's a lie.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.804
You knew about it the whole time--
he had a thing for your daughter?

06:35.854 --> 06:37.845
He never looked
at Kallie that way.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.096
That's sick.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.644
You happy now?

06:42.694 --> 06:43.729
You done?

06:43.737 --> 06:46.604
Do you care about her at all?

06:46.656 --> 06:47.816
Where do you think
you're going?

06:47.866 --> 06:49.276
I'm going to get my phone.
She called me last night.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.361
It's right there
on the counter.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.233
Shut your mouth.
I've heard enough.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.165
See? Look.
Missed call, Kallie's phone.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.500
That's nice.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.706
Your missing daughter called you
and you didn't even pick up?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.337
I was sleeping.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.043
People like you
shouldn't have kids.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.378
There's nothing here, Linden.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.251
Let's go.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.390
Should check up
on that cellphone call.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.016
Give me the keys.

07:21.399 --> 07:25.893
Just like old times.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.611
You were pretty hard
on moms back there.

07:28.657 --> 07:29.988
Don't start with me, Holder.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.527
Just saying,
you spot it, you got it.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.399
Is that one of
your addict sayings?

07:34.746 --> 07:37.158
I'm sorry.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.822
That's cool.

07:38.875 --> 07:42.117
I mean, we do say that
in the program and whatnot,

07:42.170 --> 07:44.411
but doesn't really apply.

07:44.422 --> 07:47.255
Right? To you?

07:52.097 --> 07:55.009
Detective Holder.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.716
Yes, sir.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.009
Skinner.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.553
Somebody who might
have seen our guy.

08:03.817 --> 08:08.026
I do think
about what I've done.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.279
It's not something
that I'm proud of.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.655
I've done wrong.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.909
I guess that's what
I'm trying to say.

08:15.954 --> 08:19.538
All I want is...

08:19.582 --> 08:22.449
your forgiveness.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.451
So, what you think?

08:24.504 --> 08:27.416
Toolong.
Get in, get out.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.914
I should play up this injury

08:28.967 --> 08:32.084
that these punk-ass guards
gave me, too.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.549
Sympathy, you know?

08:34.597 --> 08:36.724
Got to remember that
they're gonna want to hate me.

08:36.766 --> 08:37.755
Why would they?

08:37.809 --> 08:39.424
You're in here
for doing what I imagine

08:39.477 --> 08:41.809
was something terrible
to somebody and their family.

08:41.813 --> 08:45.351
Allegedly, man.
Come on.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.895
Seriously, what'd you do?

08:49.988 --> 08:53.731
Making restitution
ain't all fun and games.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.364
I wish you'd see that.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.117
You making moves like me and
everybody else in here, Dale.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.157
I mean, how many times
have you appealed?

09:00.206 --> 09:01.321
20?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.534
11.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.496
And how many times
you ask for forgiveness?

09:05.545 --> 09:06.500
Truthfully,

09:06.546 --> 09:11.290
there's been 8 cases
in the last 10 years

09:11.342 --> 09:13.754
where inmates met
with the victim's family

09:13.803 --> 09:16.180
and used it the next time
they appealed.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.014
Guess how many got their
sentence reduced to life.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.842
Every one.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.102
Didn't answer my question.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.102
Dale.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.854
Hmm? No, I...

09:26.900 --> 09:30.233
I ask for forgiveness
every day.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.018
Mm-hmm. And God's
keeping score. Is that it?

09:32.113 --> 09:34.104
You're just paving your way
to the sweet by and by?

09:34.157 --> 09:35.693
No, ain't got nothing
to do with that.

09:35.742 --> 09:36.697
God already has done it.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.608
- Done what?
- Forgiven me.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.698
And everyone in here.
Even you, Ray.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.864
Yeah? Well, tell him
I'm not asking for it,

09:43.917 --> 09:45.953
so he can shove it
up his heavenly rectum.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.203
Damn, you got no respect.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.545
You sure you didn't see the guy?
He didn't approach you?

09:54.552 --> 09:58.044
No. He just stood there,
then he went into the woods.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.346
What's going on?

10:00.391 --> 10:02.347
Well,
we're thinking our killer

10:02.393 --> 10:04.554
and our would-be victim
were in this location.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.063
No more than four hours ago.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.053
How do we know that?

10:07.065 --> 10:08.430
Him.

10:08.483 --> 10:09.939
Now, when Reddick gets here,

10:09.943 --> 10:12.150
I want him to go through that
kid's statement two more times.

10:12.153 --> 10:16.271
Where is Reddick, anyway?

10:16.324 --> 10:19.657
We got APBs and BOLOs out
on his cab.

10:19.661 --> 10:20.776
No hits.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.239
Okay.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.075
Kid says the girl came from
this direction, on foot.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.031
Ran straight in front
of his car.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.292
She ran off, heading east.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.874
The guy on foot
was pursuing her.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.788
And, no, he didn't get
a good look at the guy.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.423
What about the girl?
Was it Kallie?

10:35.426 --> 10:39.294
Redhead, young kid.
15 maybe. Badly cut up.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.591
We need to find this girl.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.555
You're thinking she got
that far on foot?

10:46.563 --> 10:48.053
Considering how banged up
she was?

10:48.106 --> 10:50.313
Well, with survival instincts,
anything's possible.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.726
Now, either she got away
from him

10:51.818 --> 10:53.024
and fled into the woods
or the city or--

10:53.194 --> 10:54.479
Or he caught her
and killed her.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.276
Well, until we know that,

10:55.446 --> 10:56.196
I need every inch of this park

10:56.322 --> 10:58.028
and the 10 blocks around it
searched-- now!

11:01.619 --> 11:03.359
Good for Reddick.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.404
All warm and cozy back at HQ

11:05.456 --> 11:08.584
while we're out here
ruining another pair of kicks.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.038
Hey, Linden.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.703
She came from this direction.

11:21.097 --> 11:24.635
Hey, shouldn't we be going
the other way to find her?

11:56.966 --> 12:00.709
He puts them in the biohazard
bags when he's done with them.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.798
So he's not done.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.509
He hasn't finished
what he started.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.059
What's it like?

12:07.101 --> 12:09.478
4 hours and 56 minutes

12:09.520 --> 12:13.263
since stoner boy
body-slammed her?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.022
These streets border the park.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.433
She could have run here.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.693
But at 3:00 in the morning,
it's totally empty.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.854
Sitting duck out here.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.567
Hey, I talked to Jack
for a couple of minutes

12:25.578 --> 12:26.738
a few days ago.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.699
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.496
He seems more chill
about living in Chi-Town

12:30.583 --> 12:31.789
every time we talk.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.916
Seriously, like, every time.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.785
Yeah, that's good.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.456
Yeah, he's doing real good,
little man.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.090
He's happy.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.592
I know.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.503
You should.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.545
You know.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.388
So I hope you do.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.846
Damn, Linden!

12:54.899 --> 12:57.766
Hey. Heads up
never hurt anyone.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.982
You don't want to be found,
you don't stay out in the open.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.824
The state officially set
Ray Seward's hanging

13:06.869 --> 13:08.780
to be exactly two weeks
from today.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.161
Now, the state's counting on me

13:10.206 --> 13:11.867
to make sure
this order of execution

13:11.916 --> 13:12.996
goes off without a hitch.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.582
You mean with a hitch,
don't you?

13:21.843 --> 13:23.879
It's just that kind of shit

13:23.928 --> 13:27.011
I'm not gonna tolerate
from this moment on.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.595
Hanging a man,
per the established guidelines,

13:31.602 --> 13:32.682
requires seven men.

13:32.729 --> 13:33.809
I'm one of those men.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.265
That leaves six spots.

13:35.273 --> 13:38.811
Now, these assignments must be
filled on a voluntary basis.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.101
Now, you're all a bunch
of damn psychos,

13:41.112 --> 13:43.774
so I doubt we'll have
to outsource any of this.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.128
I'm about sick
of these damn allies.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.132
Oh, man. Check it out.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.133
Ew!

14:06.179 --> 14:08.670
Smells horrible.

14:08.723 --> 14:12.136
Cops! Run! Let's go!

14:45.635 --> 14:47.626
Damn.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.923
Is that a finger?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.635
Call it in.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.512
She could have run
right through here.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.625
Maybe one of the kids
snuck her in last night.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.495
The kids know the rules.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.958
And even if they didn't,

15:24.966 --> 15:27.878
or if they wanted to break them,
they couldn't.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.669
Our lockdown policy
is followed to a "T".

15:30.721 --> 15:32.882
For the safety of everyone
at Beacon.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.141
The girl we're looking for

15:34.183 --> 15:36.014
is most likely injured
pretty badly.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.891
And she's not at any
of the local hospitals.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.017
We know that.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.564
Well, not surprising.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.313
These kids avoid contact
with city institutions

15:43.359 --> 15:44.769
at all costs.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.229
Most of them are terrified

15:46.237 --> 15:48.023
of being put back
into the system,

15:48.072 --> 15:49.187
and I don't blame them.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.275
The system is broken.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.239
It treats them
like they're criminals.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.900
Thank you, Tina.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.665
So, where does a kid go
for medical attention

16:01.711 --> 16:03.076
at 4:00 in the morning?

16:05.631 --> 16:08.794
There's somebody out there
picking them off.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.049
Killing them.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.382
We're here to help.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.306
Look, there are only
three 24-hour clinics

16:21.355 --> 16:24.643
left in the city now.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.274
I'm sure you can find them
on your own.

16:30.031 --> 16:33.319
You know,
there used to be nine.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.238
Like I said,
the system is broken.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.916
Hey.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.793
Hey, there are like
15 cops in that alley.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.124
It's like "CSI Seattle" back there.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.129
What's going on?

16:49.175 --> 16:50.335
Nothing you need
to worry about.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.920
I heard some girl got away
or something.

16:51.928 --> 16:52.917
It's got to be Kallie.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.214
We don't know who it is.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.799
Well, then, what the hell
are you doing about it?

16:55.848 --> 16:57.588
We're checking
the 24-hour clinics.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.223
She wouldn't go
to one of those.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.224
She might as well turn
herself in to CPS.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.305
Yeah, well, we got it.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.437
Hey, wh--

17:04.482 --> 17:05.972
What?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.983
I know where she would go.
I'll take you there.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.102
Then why don't you just
tell us?

17:11.155 --> 17:13.897
Because you need supervision.
It's obvious.

17:13.908 --> 17:17.571
Come on, let's go.

17:17.620 --> 17:18.700
Where are we going?

17:18.746 --> 17:20.486
Take a left at the first light.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.822
You're gonna give me directions
one light at a time?

17:22.875 --> 17:23.830
Yup.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.383
Kallie sleeps down
here when she has to.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.212
I'll go down.
You stay here.

17:37.265 --> 17:40.257
That suit's not doing you
any favors in this neighborhood.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.226
Oh.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.809
Tank's down there.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.523
If those guys are down there,
Kallie wouldn't be there.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.599
They hate girls.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.019
I got this.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.022
Where's he goin'?

17:58.869 --> 18:02.487
I could kick any one
of them punk's asses,

18:02.540 --> 18:05.202
but not when they're all
together all high like this.

18:06.294 --> 18:08.501
What is he doing?

18:18.431 --> 18:22.015
He looks like an idiot.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.266
What up?

18:31.319 --> 18:32.980
What's up with this fool, man?

18:34.405 --> 18:36.817
Yo, I'm looking for my dog.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.699
You seen my dog?
I heard he was down here.

18:39.744 --> 18:40.950
Yeah, yeah, I saw your dog.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.735
I cut his throat
and threw it in the river.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.073
That's not funny, man.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.829
Ain't that right, Jebediah?

18:45.875 --> 18:47.957
So now we got that settled,

18:48.002 --> 18:50.368
get the hell out of our squat.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.085
She has to.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.919
Me-- I mean, you got to fight
the fights you know you can win.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.960
It's, like, no way.
Not with these guys.

18:59.013 --> 19:01.095
Well, you did see my dog,
you didn't see my dog.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.051
I'm just trying to find her--
you feelin' me?

19:03.100 --> 19:04.681
Didn't you hear him?
Step off.

19:04.727 --> 19:05.887
Shoot him in the head!

19:05.936 --> 19:08.348
Shut that dog up.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.262
I grew up with seven pits,
bully breeds.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.102
You just got to dominate 'em,
you know?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.140
Show them who's pack leader.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.354
You want to find out?

19:14.362 --> 19:16.774
Let it loose. Seriously, man.
Let it at him.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.780
He'll rip your wrinkle-assed
chowder bag to shreds.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.237
Go for it.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.878
What's up, Gristle?

19:37.927 --> 19:39.918
Good boy. Good boy.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.631
Bugs is pretty lame.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.462
But he grows on you.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.222
Got to respect that.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.349
- Bugs?
- Yeah.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.935
He looks like a stretched-out
white rabbit, don't he?

19:49.939 --> 19:51.645
Hey, you got a smoke for me?

19:52.775 --> 19:54.185
Yeah.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.646
You like it?

19:59.740 --> 20:01.605
I draw 'em myself.
You want one?

20:01.617 --> 20:03.448
Maybe some other time.

20:07.581 --> 20:08.991
You know why I got
"Faith" on here?

20:09.041 --> 20:12.750
'Cause no one's got any
on me but me.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.286
Helps me remember.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.047
You'd be the North Star.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.254
I'd draw that on you.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.294
Yeah, why's that?

20:23.347 --> 20:25.884
'Cause that's what you look at
on the ocean.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.800
When you get lost,
it helps you find your way home.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.892
I heard your dog, man. Yeah.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.057
Crying 'cause La Llorona
got it.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.975
Did you hear her last night?

20:38.028 --> 20:41.520
La Llorona was out looking
for her dead children.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.488
Man, shut up, Jebediah.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.241
No ones wants to hear
that crazy Mexican gibberish.

20:46.287 --> 20:49.029
I heard her.
She killed her kids.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.869
And now she lives in the water
crying out for them.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.910
Y-you heard somebody crying
down here last night?

20:55.963 --> 20:57.203
All night.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.591
From the river.

21:21.363 --> 21:22.443
All right, fine.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.446
So if he ain't your boss,
then what is he?

21:24.492 --> 21:26.949
Your man?

21:26.994 --> 21:28.859
You're not supposed to be
smoking in here.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.073
You're smoking.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.362
Yeah, well, it's my car.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.990
Finally.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.582
Get in the back.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.715
Sit.
Always in the back.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.840
I got something.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.634
Let's go.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.062
Wait here.

23:15.019 --> 23:17.476
No body.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.637
We'll keep looking.

23:19.690 --> 23:22.523
He must have tracked her
down here.

23:22.568 --> 23:25.401
Dragged her
out of her hiding spot.

23:28.157 --> 23:30.148
Damn.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.452
You got a smoke?

23:36.040 --> 23:37.621
So, what's the next move?

23:37.666 --> 23:38.951
She's not here now,

23:39.001 --> 23:41.413
but I know tons of other places
she would go.

23:41.462 --> 23:42.952
Let's bounce.

23:51.513 --> 23:55.882
It's looking like,
for tonight at least,

23:55.976 --> 23:57.591
this might be
the end of the road.

23:57.645 --> 24:00.261
It is not over.
You don't know Kallie!

24:00.314 --> 24:03.977
We're gonna do
everything we can.

24:04.026 --> 24:06.768
This might be the time
for you to start realizing--

24:06.779 --> 24:08.064
Aah!

24:08.113 --> 24:09.398
You're a
quittin'-ass punk!

24:11.283 --> 24:13.399
Oof. Damn.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.538
You okay?

24:19.541 --> 24:21.327
Yeah.

24:25.422 --> 24:28.084
We're approaching
72 hours straight.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.548
We should probably
get some sleep.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.333
Yeah.

24:31.387 --> 24:34.629
I'll, uh, get a ride
back to the station.

24:34.682 --> 24:37.139
See you in a few hours.

24:37.184 --> 24:40.176
Wanna come by my dojo,
get some food?

24:40.229 --> 24:43.938
I'm... not a fan of tofu
and lentils.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.932
Thanks.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.062
A'ight.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.852
I'll see you maﬁana.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.941
Yeah.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.881
Hey, it’s me, so leave
me a message or whatever.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.845
Kallie, where are you?

25:20.894 --> 25:22.680
Just c-call me, okay?

25:22.730 --> 25:25.847
It's mom. Please, baby?

25:54.511 --> 25:55.717
Are you looking to party?

26:15.282 --> 26:19.776
Seward?

26:19.787 --> 26:21.402
Seward.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.782
I'm not in the mood.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.542
I want someone to know that...

26:29.546 --> 26:33.164
I'm happy tonight.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.583
My intended's coming.

26:35.636 --> 26:38.343
It's the first time
we're meeting.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.468
Face-to-face.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.881
Prison bitch.
Classy.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.674
Come on, man.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.218
You've known love.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.602
Right?

26:49.566 --> 26:51.727
You were married.

26:51.777 --> 26:55.395
What was your wife like?

26:58.742 --> 27:01.654
She raised hell
every day of her life.

27:01.662 --> 27:05.871
She was wild, and I--
and I liked that...

27:05.874 --> 27:09.162
at first when it started,
but...

27:09.211 --> 27:13.045
she wasn't made for staying,
for being a wife...

27:13.048 --> 27:14.629
a mother.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.088
She was a whore.

27:19.179 --> 27:23.218
Did you love her?

27:28.438 --> 27:30.520
Hmm?

27:30.566 --> 27:32.648
I mean, you must have.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.524
In the beginning.

27:34.570 --> 27:39.906
Just enjoy the ride
while it lasts...

27:39.950 --> 27:42.692
with your sweet intended.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.577
It'll be over soon enough.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.533
Your wife disappointed you.

27:47.583 --> 27:51.075
Is that why you killed her?

27:56.300 --> 27:59.758
Is she here?
My girlfriend?

27:59.761 --> 28:03.128
Keep it in your pants, Dale!
You too, Seward.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.805
Just save it for your visitor.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.095
Yeah, surprise. Somebody's here
to see your sorry ass, too.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.522
You don't know me.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.027
I'm Tess Clarke.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.858
He's a beautiful boy,
Mr. Seward.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.277
He's grown an inch and a half
this year.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.161
He likes to draw, play soccer.

28:28.248 --> 28:32.412
Loves video games.

28:32.461 --> 28:35.328
He asks about you.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.338
What do you want?

28:42.346 --> 28:45.884
We want to...
adopt Adrian.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.174
I brought the paperwork.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.008
It would be better for Adrian

28:50.020 --> 28:52.181
if he knew you wanted us
to have him.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.435
You came alone.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.307
Without your husband.

29:00.322 --> 29:02.278
He didn't want to come.

29:02.324 --> 29:03.689
Ah.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.662
I'll be dead in two weeks,

29:10.707 --> 29:13.790
and Adrian will be yours,
paperwork or no.

29:13.794 --> 29:17.787
So... why are you
really here?

29:17.839 --> 29:21.582
Adrian wants to see you.

29:21.635 --> 29:23.466
He's...

29:23.512 --> 29:25.503
He's forgiven you.

29:49.579 --> 29:50.830
What's wrong with you?
He's your son.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.078
Guard!

29:52.124 --> 29:53.534
Wait!

29:53.583 --> 29:55.084
I'm
5

!

29:55.127 --> 29:56.617
He needs to see you!

29:56.670 --> 29:59.002
He asks every day!

29:59.047 --> 30:01.880
He's just a little boy,
Mr. Seward!

30:01.883 --> 30:03.748
Please!

30:03.760 --> 30:06.627
Please?

30:23.572 --> 30:25.528
Do you know one of these girls?

30:25.574 --> 30:27.656
Me? Uh, no.

30:27.701 --> 30:30.568
I hate that this is happening.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.410
Why exactly are you here?

30:32.456 --> 30:34.538
Have you checked in
with Officer Tilley?

30:34.583 --> 30:35.698
N0. Should I?

30:35.751 --> 30:38.458
I'm here with my mom
to see my dad.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.957
James Skinner?

30:41.006 --> 30:43.247
Bethany?

30:43.300 --> 30:45.916
Sweetie, we need to get home.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.304
Okay, mom. Yeah.

30:48.388 --> 30:49.628
Bye.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.390
Um, I'll walk you guys out.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.266
Anything on
the Leeds phone trace?

31:03.320 --> 31:05.151
Not yet.
I'll let you know.

31:05.155 --> 31:06.065
All right.

31:37.938 --> 31:41.601
I missed the ferry to Vashon,

31:41.650 --> 31:43.356
so I figured I...

31:43.443 --> 31:46.059
Just couldn't stay away, huh?

31:46.113 --> 31:48.104
Is that Linden?

31:48.115 --> 31:49.980
Hi.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.741
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.277
Stephen has told me
so much about you.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.821
I'm Caroline.
Come on in.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.578
Let me fix you a plate.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.839
Sapaketti phat khi mao.

32:07.884 --> 32:10.921
Translation,
"Spaghetti fried shit drunk."

32:10.971 --> 32:12.882
Leftovers keep for a week.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.013
Ijust didn't realize
you had plans tonight.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.219
Quit apologizing, Linden.

32:17.227 --> 32:19.092
Let's get this DVR going.

32:19.146 --> 32:21.888
"Catfishin' Kings."
I got three of them on there.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.647
Love me some noodlin'.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.858
They-- they throw the fish
back in the lake

32:26.903 --> 32:28.279
after they catch 'em

32:28.280 --> 32:30.612
in order to keep the chi aligned
with the lake's stratosphere.

32:30.657 --> 32:31.772
Keeps it Ying and Yang.

32:31.825 --> 32:34.237
This is the "big night"
we had planned.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.824
Next time I promise we'll use
the formal dining-room table.

32:37.873 --> 32:40.080
It's okay.
I don't need a table.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.080
I can confirm that.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.866
99% of the times
I've seen Linden eat,

32:42.878 --> 32:44.914
it's been in a car.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.750
Forgot something.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.134
I, uh...

32:53.180 --> 32:55.341
hope you like red velvet.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.551
How'd you know
Linden's got a sweet tooth?

32:57.559 --> 32:59.800
It's gluten-free, vegan...

32:59.853 --> 33:02.720
all that.

33:02.772 --> 33:05.149
Happy Valentine's Day.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.901
Happy V-Day, baby.

33:09.946 --> 33:12.779
I'll bet you-- you don't know
I celebrate it on the 15th.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.361
You know, 'cause it's not
so commercial and whatnot.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.571
But I-I thought
I told you that,

33:17.579 --> 33:20.070
but ifI didn't,
then that's-- that's on me.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.070
I'm...

33:21.082 --> 33:23.949
It's my bad.

33:23.960 --> 33:27.248
It's fine.

33:37.265 --> 33:40.302
Answer your phone, babe.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.889
Holder.

33:43.939 --> 33:47.181
Okay.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.349
Bullet.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.351
She's got something.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.075
You kids be safe.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.213
So I heard that from Nadine

34:12.217 --> 34:13.627
but it took me forever
to find Lobo's ass,

34:13.677 --> 34:15.292
even though he's usually
always at EMP.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.043
And Lobo said he saw some guy
carrying a girl

34:17.097 --> 34:18.587
into the alley behind that vet.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.380
Said she was bleeding
all over the place.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.515
Lobo--
who the hell's Lobo?

34:22.602 --> 34:25.014
You got your sources.
I got mine.

34:28.525 --> 34:29.685
All right, wait here.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.816
I'll wait where I wait.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.960
Seattle PD!

35:36.009 --> 35:38.716
Open the door slowly.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.298
Are you alone in there?!

35:40.347 --> 35:41.712
No.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.672
Open the door.

35:44.726 --> 35:46.091
Come out with your hands up!

35:50.357 --> 35:51.517
I didn't do it.

35:51.524 --> 35:52.684
Down on your knees!

35:52.734 --> 35:53.849
Down on the ground!

35:53.860 --> 35:55.270
Get down!

35:55.320 --> 35:56.309
Where's the girl?

35:56.321 --> 35:57.857
She was worse
when she got here.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.316
I swear.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.609
And I don't know
who brought her.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.236
I'm paid not to know!

36:02.285 --> 36:03.445
Kallie?

36:05.288 --> 36:07.700
Linden?

36:07.749 --> 36:09.080
It's not her.
It's not Kallie.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.914
It's okay.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.705
It's okay. I'm a cop.
I'm a cop.

36:16.758 --> 36:18.794
Please! Please, don't!

36:18.802 --> 36:20.133
- Shh.
- Please!

36:20.136 --> 36:23.879
It's okay. Holder! Shh, shh.

36:31.648 --> 36:32.888
Now lift.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.645
We have to get a statement
as soon as she's awake.

36:36.736 --> 36:37.725
She saw him.

36:37.779 --> 36:39.269
All right, you go ahead
to the hospital.

36:39.322 --> 36:40.277
I'll meet you there.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.564
Igot to...

36:45.245 --> 36:47.736
Yeah, good luck.

36:47.789 --> 36:49.745
Yeah.

37:04.848 --> 37:07.555
That girl gonna be all right?

37:07.600 --> 37:10.808
Yeah, she is.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.893
I'm starting to think that...

37:15.942 --> 37:18.103
all the memories I got
of Kallie

37:18.153 --> 37:21.441
are gonna be the only ones
I'll ever have.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.780
She's probably dead, isn't she?

37:32.625 --> 37:34.490
Yeah.

38:27.555 --> 38:29.136
So, how'd it go?

38:29.182 --> 38:31.924
Meeting your victim's family.

38:34.062 --> 38:37.930
They yell at you
or break down crying?

38:37.982 --> 38:40.598
You tell them your sob story...

38:40.652 --> 38:43.064
or what?

38:43.071 --> 38:45.062
Yeah.

38:45.114 --> 38:48.572
I told them my story.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.033
Hey.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.168
You want to know what I did?

39:00.213 --> 39:03.000
What my crime was?

39:03.049 --> 39:05.916
I went into the room
near the kitchen...

39:05.969 --> 39:08.426
where he keeps his safe.

39:10.807 --> 39:13.890
He's always put the cash there
every night

39:13.893 --> 39:15.224
after close-up time.

39:15.270 --> 39:18.808
You don't have to tell me this.

39:18.898 --> 39:22.311
And I opened up the safe,

39:22.360 --> 39:24.271
took the money.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.777
That's when he said,
"Boy."

39:29.826 --> 39:32.943
He was behind me.

39:32.996 --> 39:35.203
In his pajamas.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.243
That's when I shot him.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.748
And she...

39:45.341 --> 39:49.209
she was there, too.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.757
Standing on the stairs.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.343
I shot her, too.

39:56.352 --> 39:58.513
They said I didn't mean it.

40:01.274 --> 40:03.230
Killing my daddy.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.775
My mama.

40:06.779 --> 40:11.739
And I don't
know why but today...

40:11.784 --> 40:14.776
my brother and sister,

40:14.829 --> 40:17.787
they-- they sat there
and they forgave me.

40:17.832 --> 40:21.620
They forgave me.

40:35.224 --> 40:36.600
Hey, it's me.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.474
You bring any food?

40:43.983 --> 40:45.644
You couldn't just stay
at your mom's hotel?

40:46.778 --> 40:50.646
I can't stop thinking
about Kallie.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.734
I've been calling her all day.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.651
How many times I gotta tell you?
She's gonna be fine.

40:55.703 --> 40:58.661
You don't listen to me.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.322
They came by again today.

41:01.376 --> 41:02.491
The cops.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.411
What'd they want?

41:08.841 --> 41:10.217
Nothin'.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.927
You gonna come to bed?

41:19.018 --> 41:22.431
I'm gonna have a shower.

41:43.876 --> 41:45.412
Come on, baby.
