00:49.841 --> 00:51.889
Ah, pleasure to meet you.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.436
Pleasure to meet you.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.018
Thank you for your support.
Enjoy the parade.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.024
Hello, there. How are you'?

00:58.308 --> 00:59.560
Well, Mr. Hidell,

00:59.851 --> 01:01.945
no one can say that Toronto
doesn't love us now.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.607
- As for members
of the orange lodge,

01:04.897 --> 01:05.897
yes, Mr. mayor.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.072
As for our policies
at city hall.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.452
That's up for debate.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.704
Not today, it isn't,

01:11.989 --> 01:13.030
gentlemen.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.592
When the parade
turns onto queen street,

01:14.658 --> 01:16.877
keep your eyes open for anyone
concealing their hands-

01:17.160 --> 01:19.083
handkerchiefs, newspapers,
hands in pockets,

01:19.371 --> 01:20.293
that sort of thing.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.457
Sir, you're taking the threats

01:21.748 --> 01:22.749
against the mayor's life
seriously?

01:23.041 --> 01:24.509
- We can't take any chances,
George.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.295
Sir.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.966
- Another summer,
another bloody orange parade.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.510
- At least the crowd
looks cheerful.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.179
- That's because they're all
protestants around here.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.438
Just wait till the parade
cuts through Corktown.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.084
See how cheerful
everybody is then.

01:39.349 --> 01:42.193
- Why does the parade
have to go through Corktown'?

01:42.477 --> 01:44.678
- It's all about rubbing
the catholic noses in the dirt,

01:44.855 --> 01:45.731
me old mucker,

01:46.023 --> 01:49.493
take away the Catholics,
there's nothing to parade about.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.287
That was a bloody gunshot,
Murdoch.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.832
Driver! Go! Go!

02:03.123 --> 02:04.921
Get!

02:15.719 --> 02:17.062
This is good.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.809
Mayor Hopkins, are you hit?

02:24.227 --> 02:26.150
- The bullet just
passed through.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.735
<i>. Oh.</i>

02:29.483 --> 02:31.781
Yes, sir, I'm afraid it did.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.753
- George.
- Detective.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.517
Sir, we're getting
convicting reports.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.960
Some people think the shot
came from this direction.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.171
Other people think
that it was from here,

02:47.459 --> 02:48.927
behind these packing crates.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.760
- No, George.
What they heard was an echo.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.016
Let's see.
The carriage was here.

02:55.967 --> 02:59.062
So the shot
must have come from...

02:59.346 --> 03:00.973
There.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.822
- Was that a gunshot
Ä± heard just now?

03:09.106 --> 03:10.528
- It was. Where were you
when you heard it'?

03:10.816 --> 03:11.774
I was on the stairs.

03:11.775 --> 03:12.867
I was coming down
to see the parade.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.869
- Your name, ma'am?
- Judith Lance.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.245
- Have you see anyone else
on these stairs?

03:16.530 --> 03:19.579
- Well, a man passed by
with a carpet a few moments ago.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.543
Check the upper floors.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.799
- You, there! Stop!
Identify yourself!

03:32.087 --> 03:33.888
- Leonard bowers,
- What's your business here?

03:34.005 --> 03:36.133
- I'm the janitor.
What's happening?

03:36.425 --> 03:38.666
- Have you seen anyone else
here in the last few minutes?

03:38.677 --> 03:39.719
No, sir.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.097
- Higgins,
check the fourth floor.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.389
All right.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.434
Who are you'?

03:46.685 --> 03:47.982
Toronto constabulary.

03:48.270 --> 03:49.066
What's your name,

03:49.354 --> 03:51.195
and what business do you have
in this building?

03:51.231 --> 03:53.325
- Clay Miller.
I own this building.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.656
- Do you have a key
to this door'?

03:56.486 --> 03:58.363
Yes. Yes, of course.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.542
- Sir.
- What have you, George?

04:10.834 --> 04:12.461
- The building
is mostly empty, sir.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.723
- Everyone was likely outside,
waiting for the parade.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.926
- There was a janitor
on the third floor landing.

04:18.048 --> 04:19.892
- What's his name?
- Leonard bowers.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.100
- That's right.
He works for me.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.060
Mr. Miller...

04:27.392 --> 04:28.769
Who rents this space?

04:29.060 --> 04:31.233
No one at the moment.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.823
A shell casing, sir.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.152
No sign of the shooter, sir,

04:35.153 --> 04:36.474
but the door lo the roof
was open.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.965
- He likely went
down the fire escape.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.078
Nevertheless, Henry,

04:39.362 --> 04:41.660
have constables do a thorough
check of the building.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.665
Mr. Miller, you have a camera.

04:46.328 --> 04:49.081
Did you take any photographs
prior to the shooting?

04:49.706 --> 04:51.003
I did, yes.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.089
- Then I'll be needing
your camera.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.844
George, Henry, confiscate
every camera out there today.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.008
Yes, sir.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.647
- We found where the shot
came from, sir.

05:05.931 --> 05:06.971
What about the shooter'?

05:07.057 --> 05:08.618
- Must have slipped away
with the crowd.

05:08.725 --> 05:09.647
Bloody hell.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.403
Well, let's round up
the usual troublemakers.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.279
Who would they be, sin'?

05:13.563 --> 05:14.985
The Irish catholic, of course.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.490
Sir, I'm catholic.

05:16.775 --> 05:19.153
Are you a troublemaker?

05:19.444 --> 05:22.197
Start with the known agitators,
and let's see where we are.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.347
- You were found
two blocks from the shooting.

05:39.631 --> 05:40.671
What were you doing there?

05:40.799 --> 05:42.267
- I was waiting
to see the parade.

05:42.551 --> 05:43.768
Why would a catholic man

05:44.052 --> 05:46.100
want to watch
the Orangemen march?

05:46.388 --> 05:47.935
I love a good parade.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.394
- You were arrested
last year for inciting a riot.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.030
You once threatened
to firebomb the orange lodge.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.361
- I've seen the error
of my ways.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.993
- Where were you
between 11:30 and noon?

06:00.277 --> 06:01.824
- I was having lunch
with a friend'

06:02.112 --> 06:03.614
Sean Gallagher's his name.

06:03.905 --> 06:07.705
- Mr. Gallagher, are you
at all familiar with Liam Cuddy?

06:07.993 --> 06:10.212
- Indeed lam.
I've known him almost 20 years.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.839
- Oh.
When did you see him last?

06:13.123 --> 06:15.404
- Sitting in your hallway,
wondering what he's doing here,

06:15.417 --> 06:17.135
like the rest of us.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.262
Before that'?

06:19.546 --> 06:21.674
- We were having a pint
and a beef slew

06:21.965 --> 06:23.137
at Murphy's lunch counter.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.052
Until what time?

06:25.343 --> 06:28.187
- Until shortly after noon,
I'd say.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.269
Sir, I've conducted...

06:32.809 --> 06:36.313
- Detective Murdoch,
Ä± see you've returned.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.067
Chief constable. Yes, Ä± have.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.861
Congratulations
on your promotion.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.496
Yes, that's right.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.202
You left town
before Ä± was appointed.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.912
Quite suddenly, as Ä± recall.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.544
Almost as if you were
fleeing justice.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.421
What have you got, Murdoch?

06:53.705 --> 06:56.424
- Sir, I've interviewed all
of the known Irish agitators,

06:56.708 --> 06:58.460
and all of them claim alibis.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.675
- Well, it'll take a couple
of days to check them all out.

07:00.962 --> 07:01.961
And until you do,

07:01.963 --> 07:04.466
all of the suspects
remain in custody.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.101
That's impossible.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.352
My jail cells
are fit to burst as it is.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.856
- One of these men
is the killer.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.517
- Which means
the rest of them are not.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.151
We detain them all,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
it could cause riots
in the streets.

07:17.729 --> 07:18.969
Do you really want a recreation

07:19.230 --> 07:21.403
of the battle of the Boyne
in Toronto?

07:21.691 --> 07:23.739
Well, have it your way.

07:24.027 --> 07:27.122
But find me the killer,
and soon.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.998
This is a protestant city.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.582
The Irish Catholics are not
the only people who can riot.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.008
William!

07:47.425 --> 07:48.267
Julia.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.100
- I'd heard you were back.
- You look...

07:52.389 --> 07:53.936
Uh, well, you're-
you're married now.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.396
Um...

07:57.268 --> 07:58.986
Do Ä± look that different?

07:59.270 --> 08:01.523
- No, no, of course not.
What Ä± meant to say is...

08:02.774 --> 08:06.244
Well. My best wishes
to you and Darcy.

08:06.528 --> 08:09.281
- Well, that's very kind of you.
Thank you.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.375
- And Ä± apologize
for not being able to attend.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.582
- I think Ä± understand
why you didn't.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.619
Julia-

08:16.621 --> 08:18.965
- we must accept the decisions
we've made, William.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.672
It's the only way
to move on with our lives.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.804
Now, how can Ä± help you,
detective'?

08:29.634 --> 08:31.136
Have you completed
your post-mortem

08:31.428 --> 08:32.725
on alderman Hidell?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.481
It's being done as we speak.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.517
My protégé©, Dr. grace,
is taking the lead on this case.

08:37.808 --> 08:38.684
Your protégé©?

08:38.977 --> 08:42.447
- She's more than capable,
Ä± assure you.

08:42.731 --> 08:43.982
Death was instantaneous.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.322
The bullet entered
the victim's right temporal lobe

08:46.609 --> 08:48.862
at approximately 22 degrees.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.498
It deformed immediately
after penetration,

08:51.781 --> 08:54.500
resulting in the massive wounds
transecting the brain.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.661
Bu! I'm curious.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.172
What kind of bullet
can enter a man's skull,

08:59.456 --> 09:02.926
cause extensive internal damage,
and yet not exit the cranium?

09:03.209 --> 09:04.506
Certain high-velocity rounds

09:04.794 --> 09:06.637
tend to deform faster
upon impact,

09:06.921 --> 09:08.218
leading to less penetration.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.806
In this case,
it was a center-fire 30-30.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.345
Hmm.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.764
Who would use
this type of ammunition?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.229
Hunters, farmers, sportsmen.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.440
But you, of course,
knew that already.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.401
Dr. Ogden tests me
at every turn.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.531
Please don't feel
you have to do the same.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.570
- Dr. grace, detective Murdoch
is among the best in his field.

09:29.861 --> 09:33.115
This comes from experience
and deserves respect.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.285
It's quite all right, Julia.
- Julia?

09:38.244 --> 09:40.872
- Yes. Please excuse me.
Dr. Ogden.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.632
Please, William.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.339
- Is the bullets trajectory
through the mayors hat

09:45.627 --> 09:48.972
consistent with the entry wound
in alderman Hidell's skull?

09:49.255 --> 09:50.677
The bullet

09:50.965 --> 09:54.185
passed through the hat
at an angle of 12 degrees.

09:54.469 --> 09:57.939
- But entered alderman Hidell's
skull at 22 degrees.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.442
- It is my theory that
at the moment of impact,

10:00.725 --> 10:02.398
alderman Hidell's head
was tilted

10:02.685 --> 10:04.232
ten degrees to the right,

10:04.521 --> 10:06.364
perhaps leaning
into the conversation.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.525
Hmm.

10:08.817 --> 10:11.411
A single shot, then,
intended for the mayor

10:11.694 --> 10:13.321
but killing
alderman Hidell instead.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.287
- That would be my conclusion.
Dr. Ogden?

10:16.574 --> 10:17.996
I concur.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.706
Very good.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.837
Dr. grace,
it was a pleasure to meet you.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.544
Thank you for your insights.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.756
Dr. Ogden, once again,
my regards to Darcy.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.916
Sir?

11:06.207 --> 11:07.459
What have you, George?

11:07.750 --> 11:10.150
- The first batch of photographs
from the confiscated cameras

11:10.170 --> 11:11.968
and some slides and prints.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.632
There's still a roll
of moving picture film

11:13.923 --> 11:14.922
that needs to be developed.

11:14.924 --> 11:18.019
- Anything of interest'?
- Yes, sir.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.271
See this chap
in the background here'?

11:21.806 --> 11:24.184
I believe you interviewed him
earlier today.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.194
- Yes, George,
that's Liam Cuddy.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.158
He told me he was nowhere
near the building

11:29.439 --> 11:30.560
at the time of the shooting.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.408
- I'd say that carpet
he's carrying

11:32.692 --> 11:35.536
would easily conceal a rifle.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.708
- Most people would handle
a rifle cartridge

11:39.991 --> 11:42.961
with their thumb, index finger,

11:43.244 --> 11:44.712
and possibly
their middle finger.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.465
Now, the print I've recovered
from this shell casing

11:47.749 --> 11:48.625
is the wrong pattern

11:48.917 --> 11:51.090
and too small
to be a thumb print.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.469
But...

12:01.721 --> 12:05.851
It's just the right size

12:06.142 --> 12:09.066
to match Liam (Buddy's
index finger.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.731
So we have our man.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.901
Not anymore.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.433
I convinced the chief constable

12:16.694 --> 12:18.571
to release all of them
earlier today.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.117
- On what basis?
- Not enough evidence.

12:22.951 --> 12:26.046
But here it is.

12:26.329 --> 12:29.799
And I'll be sure
not to let him go this time.

12:39.092 --> 12:43.848
Toronto constabulary!
Liam Cuddy, show yourself!

12:44.138 --> 12:46.140
Go on.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.858
On your feet

12:53.773 --> 12:55.741
- who are you?
- Marianne Cuddy.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.652
You have no right
to trespass like this.

12:57.944 --> 12:58.740
Where's Liam?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.829
- I don't know.
He left for work this morning.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.245
- Crabtree,
check the rest of apartment.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.910
Liam has done nothing wrong.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.522
- He lied to an officer
of the law

13:06.661 --> 13:09.039
investigating a murder.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.798
- We have proof
he was in the area

13:11.082 --> 13:12.129
just before the shooting.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.385
- What shooting?
- The orange parade.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.387
Don't play
silly buggers with me.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.756
I'm catholic'

13:19.048 --> 13:20.721
Ä± don't pay any mind
to that parade.

13:21.009 --> 13:21.851
I wasn't there.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.308
I found this in the closet.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.109
Ah.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.361
A center-fire 30-30.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.067
Imagine that.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.732
- Liam would never
shoot anybody.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.867
It wasn't him. He was set up.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.529
- If you wish to help Liam,
tell us where he is.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.323
I honestly have no idea.

13:45.408 --> 13:49.003
- We had him, locked up,
and what did we do?

13:49.287 --> 13:51.506
We let him walkout, of course.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.757
Just brilliant.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.589
- Sir, we had no more reason
to hold Liam Cuddy

13:55.877 --> 13:57.550
than any other suspect.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.510
- Send out an alert
to all stations.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.014
I've taken care of that.

14:01.299 --> 14:04.018
- Sir, the late edition
already has the story,

14:04.302 --> 14:05.462
with a picture of Liam Cuddy.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.360
How did they know
he would be our suspect?

14:07.430 --> 14:09.899
- First to tell the story
sells the paper, George.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.059
Good thing.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.591
With his face
all over the city,

14:12.852 --> 14:14.612
it shouldn't be too difficult
to pick him up.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.984
Again.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.698
- Crabtree, Ä± want you, Higgins,
and every available constable

14:20.985 --> 14:22.425
out on patrol
looking for Liam Cuddy.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.528
Sir.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.826
Well, get a move on.

14:26.783 --> 14:29.127
Aren't you glad
you came home, Murdoch?

14:31.579 --> 14:33.499
- It seems to me that
the whole orange day parade

14:33.664 --> 14:35.025
just smacks oi being
a sore winner'

14:35.124 --> 14:35.920
how so?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.131
Well, every year,

14:37.418 --> 14:38.761
the protestants want to remind
the Catholics

14:39.045 --> 14:40.171
that they lost a battle.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.181
One battle 200 years ago,
George.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.183
- Ah, it's a simple show
of pride, Henry.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.466
Ugh.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.095
Whoa!

14:47.387 --> 14:49.185
Good evening!

14:49.472 --> 14:51.019
You call that pride, George?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.293
- There's nothing
on Liam's whereabouts yet.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.583
Any luck with the rifle?

15:19.585 --> 15:20.381
Yes, sir.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.110
I've lifted two sets
of finger marks,

15:22.213 --> 15:24.386
Liam Cuddy's
and his wife, Marianne's.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.894
And judging by the residue
in the barrel...

15:29.303 --> 15:31.556
The gun was fired very recently.

15:31.848 --> 15:32.893
So that's it, then.

15:32.894 --> 15:35.564
Enough to put a rope
around Liam's neck.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.946
Yes, sir, Ä± suppose it is.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.327
Hey! You there!

15:44.610 --> 15:47.284
What's that all about?
- Crabtree.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.692
Oh. My God. It's Liam Cuddy.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.205
Mr. Cuddy, can you hear me?

15:55.496 --> 15:57.590
We'll get you some help.
- I'll be right back.

15:57.874 --> 15:58.995
You're gonna be all right.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.844
- It wasn't me.
- What did you say?

16:02.128 --> 16:04.802
I'm just a patsy.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.768
- George, did you get
a good look at the men

16:17.059 --> 16:18.060
running from the alley?

16:18.352 --> 16:19.524
No, sir.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.252
I just found these
around the corner.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.029
Looks like the killer
discarded the evidence.

16:27.195 --> 16:29.163
Do you think he was
deliberately targeted, sir?

16:29.447 --> 16:31.745
Detective Murdoch.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.626
I heard on the call box
that station house three

16:33.910 --> 16:35.190
just arrested
a gang of Orangemen

16:35.244 --> 16:36.724
for assaulting
an Irish catholic, sir.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.756
One of them
wasn't wearing any shoes.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.174
Or boots.

16:47.340 --> 16:51.345
- Listen, Ä± was the one
who got beat down.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.638
I was going home after pints,

16:53.930 --> 16:56.558
and a bunch of God-loving
Catholics knocked me down,

16:56.849 --> 16:58.601
took my boots.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.146
- How do you explain
your arrest?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.939
Well, Ä± chased after them,

17:03.231 --> 17:04.711
and by the time
Ä± caught up with them,

17:04.857 --> 17:06.279
my mates were already
swinging fists

17:06.567 --> 17:07.568
with these bastards!

17:07.859 --> 17:09.703
Then the police show up,
haul me off,

17:09.987 --> 17:12.536
and the only thing Ä± got
was my arse kicked

17:12.823 --> 17:14.369
and my boots stolen.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.291
Those aren't mine.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.720
Try them on. I insist.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.939
- So I'm a size ten.
What of it'?

17:41.227 --> 17:43.400
Same as half the men
in this city.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
- With Liam dead,
someone saved the crown attorney

17:48.234 --> 17:49.276
a pile of work

17:49.277 --> 17:50.477
Ä±f we assume his guilt, sir.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.613
All we have at the moment
are two unsolved murders.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.545
- If Ä± may say,
Ä± think we should consider

17:54.740 --> 17:56.458
Liam Cuddy's dying words.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.744
He dismissed himself
as being just a patsy.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.035
Yes.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.317
- What the bloody hell's
a palsy?

18:01.372 --> 18:04.842
"- It's an Irish expression, sir,
for â€œunknowing dupe."

18:05.126 --> 18:07.094
Well, that's bollocks.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.096
We've got Liam's finger marks
on his rifle

18:09.380 --> 18:11.803
and on a shell-casing recovered
from the scene of the crime.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.513
He bare-face lied
about where he was

18:13.801 --> 18:14.922
at the time of the shooting.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.683
He had "guilt" written
right across his forehead.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.611
- Exactly, sir,
which is why Ä± find it odd

18:18.806 --> 18:20.149
that he would only admit
to being a patsy.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.478
I mean, as a catholic,

18:21.479 --> 18:23.898
is he not supposed to confess
his sins before he dies?

18:24.186 --> 18:25.904
- Crabtree, has it ever
occurred to you

18:26.188 --> 18:28.566
that a murderer
can also be a liar,

18:28.858 --> 18:30.110
even to the great almighty'?

18:30.401 --> 18:32.244
- Yes. But shouldn't we
give Liam

18:32.528 --> 18:33.495
the benefit of the doubt

18:33.496 --> 18:36.161
before we condemn him
posthumously'?

18:36.449 --> 18:37.621
Show him the photograph.

18:37.908 --> 18:41.082
- Sir, this is a picture
of Liam Cuddy

18:41.370 --> 18:42.530
entering the Miller building.

18:42.705 --> 18:45.003
Look at the reflection
in this window.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.571
- It's the city hall
clock tower.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.302
Note the time, sir.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.464
One minute after 12:00.

18:51.756 --> 18:52.552
How’s that?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.433
It's a reflected image.

18:54.717 --> 18:57.391
- Right, right.
So it's one minute before noon.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.180
That's pretty tight, isn't it?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.395
- Did Liam Cuddy have time
to enter the building,

19:01.682 --> 19:05.528
set up his rifle, lake the shot,
all in less than 60 seconds?

19:07.355 --> 19:08.732
You better find out.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.400
According to the photograph,

19:10.691 --> 19:12.693
he was standing
roughly here, George.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.783
- Sir, shall we assume
the rifle is loaded?

19:15.071 --> 19:16.711
Otherwise, it might add
about four seconds

19:16.781 --> 19:18.221
to our time line
inside the building.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.158
Right.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.169
Assume it's loaded
for the first run.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.421
The first run?

19:24.705 --> 19:26.332
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

19:26.624 --> 19:29.969
- All right, George.
On my mark.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.253
Go!

20:09.500 --> 20:11.673
Take time to line up
a proper shot

20:16.090 --> 20:17.216
bang.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.721
- All right.
Slop there, George.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.514
- I thought we'd time the escape
as well, sir.

20:23.806 --> 20:24.848
No need.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.351
We're already
at the 75-second mark

20:26.642 --> 20:29.065
Ä±t's unlikely Liam Cuddy
had time to make the shot.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.230
- Let alone escape
from the fourth floor.

20:31.522 --> 20:32.614
Exactly.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.418
Yet a witness claims
to have seen a man

20:34.650 --> 20:37.699
running up the stairs
with a rolled-up carpet.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.427
- I was right here
on the third floor

20:39.613 --> 20:40.910
when he passed me by.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.996
- On his way
to the fourth floor.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.325
Yes.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.373
He was in such a rush,

20:45.661 --> 20:47.421
he nearly hit me on the head
with the carpet.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.675
But he apologized.
I thought that was very nice.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.380
And what then?

20:52.668 --> 20:55.012
- Well, then Ä± continued
downstairs to catch the parade.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.390
That's when
Ä± heard the loud bang.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.594
You heard the gunshot

20:58.841 --> 21:00.809
after the man passed you
on the stairs?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.266
Yes, that's right.

21:03.554 --> 21:04.897
Thank you, Mrs. Lance.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.025
- Sir, if the gunshot came
from the second floor

21:08.309 --> 21:09.902
while Liam Cuddy was on his way
to the fourth floor,

21:10.186 --> 21:11.688
there's no way he
could have pulled the trigger.

21:11.979 --> 21:12.946
He was a palsy.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.028
So it would seem, George.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.411
Mrs. Lance was standing
on the third-floor landing

21:19.695 --> 21:21.447
when Liam Cuddy passed by her.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.992
That was before
the shot was fired.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.081
- You think she's
a reliable witness?

21:26.368 --> 21:27.494
- She seemed fairly sharp
to me, sir.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.787
And you know for a fact

21:28.996 --> 21:30.597
that the shot came
from the second floor?

21:30.748 --> 21:32.591
- It's consistent
with the angle of the shot

21:32.875 --> 21:33.796
through the mayor's hat

21:34.043 --> 21:35.563
and the relative height
of the two men.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.134
It's also where we found
the spent shell casing.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.015
- Which you now think
was planted.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.846
- There's no other
explanation, sir.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.556
Liam Cuddy was set up.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.804
- A little due diligence
could have uncovered this

21:45.930 --> 21:48.274
before we announced Cuddy
as our chief suspect.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.855
- We weren't exactly given
the opportunity, were we?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.861
This is bad news.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.113
The city believes
we've got the killer.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.616
The Orangemen are calm.
The Catholics are cowed.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.153
If this gets out,
it could set them all off again.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.991
- And the parade has been
rescheduled

22:02.279 --> 22:03.371
for two days from now.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.953
Could be a blood bath.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.584
- We need to re-interview
all the witnesses.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.869
Who provided Cuddy's alibi?

22:09.161 --> 22:11.163
- I don't think we're looking
at a catholic, sir.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.002
And how’s that?

22:13.290 --> 22:15.213
- Sir, if the shooting
was motivated

22:15.501 --> 22:17.174
by hatred toward
the orange lodge,

22:17.461 --> 22:19.179
why then set up
a fellow catholic?

22:19.463 --> 22:22.683
- Yes, you lot do like
to stick together, don'! You?

22:24.051 --> 22:25.098
This doesn't get out.

22:25.386 --> 22:26.558
Conduct your investigations

22:26.846 --> 22:28.126
as if you're tying up
loose ends.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.355
Is that understood?

22:38.691 --> 22:41.661
- The liver is a treasure house
of information.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.704
Even a cursory inspection
of this man's liver

22:43.863 --> 22:45.206
tells us he was
a heavy drinker.

22:45.489 --> 22:48.538
Further analysis
will no doubt confirm it.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.747
So why have you chosen
to work here,

22:53.038 --> 22:55.006
as opposed to the land
of the living?

22:55.291 --> 22:56.372
I don't have the patience

22:56.625 --> 22:59.048
to adopt a cheerful
bedside manner.

22:59.336 --> 23:02.385
And you, doctor?

23:02.673 --> 23:05.392
- I suppose Ä± see myself
as an agent of the law.

23:05.676 --> 23:06.848
Detective Murdoch and Ä±

23:07.136 --> 23:08.888
have brought many criminals
to justice.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.523
I found it
to be richly satisfying.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.229
"Found" it'?

23:13.517 --> 23:16.441
Oh, yes. I meant "find" it.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.697
- Like Ä± said,
Ä± don't know anything.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.954
Mrs. Cuddy,

23:30.242 --> 23:33.246
Ä± understand your reluctance
to speak to the police.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.289
L, too, am catholic'

23:36.790 --> 23:38.667
That's my intention
to clear your husband’s name.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.678
But Ä± need to know everything
he's told you.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.846
He came home wild with fright.

23:47.134 --> 23:50.138
He showed me a rifle
he had wrapped up in a carpet.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.352
He said he found it
at the office.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.607
Which office?

23:53.891 --> 23:56.064
- Where he was delivering
the carpet to.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.730
The rifle was just leaning
against the desk

23:59.021 --> 24:00.694
why did he take it?

24:00.981 --> 24:02.858
It was his rifle.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.824
He recognized it.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.533
What was it doing there?

24:07.821 --> 24:11.667
- Someone must have taken it
and put it there.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.161
He was set up.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.500
Yes.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.836
A regular patsy bolivar,
he was.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.376
I can prove it too.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.432
This is his waybill for
the carpet he was delivering.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.265
It's says right there,
"must deliver by 12:00 noon."

24:30.552 --> 24:31.929
Now, why would they say that

24:32.221 --> 24:35.316
if they didn't want him
to be there right at that time?

24:42.481 --> 24:43.607
Yes, that's my carpet.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.947
I had it sent out
to be cleaned.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.863
- It was delivered
by Liam Cuddy.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.906
I never received it.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.245
Hmm.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.854
Did you ask for it
to be delivered

24:54.076 --> 24:56.170
to your fourth-floor office
before noon?

24:56.453 --> 24:58.171
I believe Ä± did.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.924
[ Couldn't expect my staff
to miss the orange parade

25:01.208 --> 25:03.176
waiting for a carpet
to be delivered.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.837
Don'! You find it strange

25:05.129 --> 25:06.756
that the man
delivering your carpet

25:07.047 --> 25:09.846
is the same man accused
of an assassination attempt

25:10.134 --> 25:11.602
on the mayor'?

25:11.885 --> 25:15.515
- I imagine that was his excuse
for being there.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.144
- You took this photograph,
did you not'?

25:20.436 --> 25:22.188
I did.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.026
May Ä± ask,

25:24.314 --> 25:27.158
what were you taking
a photograph of?

25:28.277 --> 25:31.827
- I guess Ä± was just
recording the day.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.161
<i>. Oh.</i>

25:33.449 --> 25:35.167
So Ä± suppose we're just lucky

25:35.451 --> 25:39.627
that you happened to take this
photograph at this exact time.

25:41.749 --> 25:44.127
- May Ä± ask the purpose
of this interview'?

25:44.418 --> 25:46.716
Just tying up loose ends.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.845
- Sir, Ä± spoke
to Liam Cuddy's boss.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.213
Apparently, he left the
carpet cleaners at 11100 A.M.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.638
It's hardly a 20-minute walk
to Mr. Miller's office.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.432
- Then he should have arrived
well before noon.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.647
- I wonder what look him
an hour.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.733
Perhaps someone held him up.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.440
- We were having a pint
and a beef slew

26:06.732 --> 26:07.904
at Murphy's lunch counter.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.364
Until what time?

26:09.651 --> 26:12.370
- Until shortly after noon,
I'd say.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.999
- Mr. Gallagher,
this photograph was taken

26:16.283 --> 26:18.001
shortly before noon yesterday.

26:18.285 --> 26:19.377
What of it?

26:19.661 --> 26:23.006
- You claim you were with
Liam Cuddy until after noon.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.463
So Ä± was wrong about the time.

26:25.751 --> 26:26.798
I bought the man lunch.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.178
I wasn't lying.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.590
Do you often buy him lunch?

26:30.881 --> 26:32.428
I wanted to talk with him.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.343
What about'?

26:36.053 --> 26:37.680
Liam was a firebrand.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.065
He liked to stir things up
with the Orangemen.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.023
As a businessman and leader
of the Irish community,

26:43.310 --> 26:44.732
Ä± felt obliged
to impress upon him

26:45.020 --> 26:47.273
that his behavior was
in conflict with our interests.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.451
I thought Ä± had succeeded.

26:59.785 --> 27:00.985
Is Gallagher involved, then?

27:01.036 --> 27:02.333
I have no proof, sir.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.043
But Ä± can't think
of a better way

27:04.331 --> 27:06.379
to time Liam (Buddy's arrival
at the murder scene.

27:06.667 --> 27:07.884
You think he set him up?

27:08.168 --> 27:11.047
- He knew where Liam lived,
had access to his rifle.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.432
The question is, why?

27:13.715 --> 27:15.809
Why would he set him up?

27:18.887 --> 27:21.015
Sir.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.024
I arranged the photographs
chronologically.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.869
I've noticed something
very interesting.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.396
See these two chaps
in the background here.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.531
Note that this man is pointing

27:29.815 --> 27:32.568
in exactly the same direction
as these witnesses are here.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.784
<i>- This photograph was taken
after the shooting.</i>

27:36.071 --> 27:37.872
- Yes, sir, but this one
was taken beforehand.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.546
He's pointing to where
the shot came from,

27:39.783 --> 27:41.330
before the shot was fired.

27:46.415 --> 27:47.455
That's alderman Ketchem.

27:47.583 --> 27:48.550
And look who he's speaking to.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.552
Do you recognize
those sideburns?

27:51.753 --> 27:52.629
Curious.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.001
- Now, what would a warehouse
stacker like Jack Leary

27:55.007 --> 27:56.759
be doing chatting up
an alderman?

27:57.050 --> 27:58.472
They're both Orangemen.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.888
- Oh, but they're not
like masons, sir.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.478
A man like Leary
wouldn't mix with the toffs.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.233
Right, then, George.

28:05.517 --> 28:09.112
Look into why an aldermen might
want to have the mayor killed.

28:09.396 --> 28:10.818
But remember, be discreet.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.655
As far as anyone's concerned,
Liam Cuddy is our only suspect

28:13.942 --> 28:14.984
sir.

28:14.985 --> 28:17.329
- And, George, there was
a moving picture of this.

28:17.613 --> 28:18.734
When will that be developed?

28:18.906 --> 28:20.249
I'll check into it, sir.

28:45.974 --> 28:49.274
Sir, Ä± believe
I've discovered something.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.063
As you know, a few years back,

28:51.355 --> 28:52.995
city council appointed
a board of control,

28:53.273 --> 28:54.775
comprised of three aldermen.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.161
Well, sir, according
to my sources at city hall...

28:57.444 --> 28:58.240
What sources?

28:58.528 --> 29:00.608
Well, sir, my aunt Petunia
works at the lunch counter

29:00.781 --> 29:02.078
where the mayor
takes his meals.

29:03.533 --> 29:04.894
So she says she overheard
the mayor

29:04.910 --> 29:05.910
speaking with a colleague

29:06.036 --> 29:08.380
about how he thought the board
had become too powerful.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.465
He was going to break up
the board of control,

29:10.666 --> 29:12.088
and Ä± think that's why
they tried to kill him.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.673
Who is "they," George?

29:13.961 --> 29:16.635
- Well, sir. Everyone who stood
to benefit from the status quo:

29:16.922 --> 29:18.265
Business owners, contractors,

29:18.548 --> 29:20.767
the members of the board
themselves, of course,

29:21.051 --> 29:22.093
the whole-

29:22.094 --> 29:24.768
call it the municipal-industrial
complex.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.147
- George. The victim
was part of the board.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.654
- Well, sir, it's my belief
that Hidell was the only one

29:32.938 --> 29:34.656
who was not
one of the conspirators.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.864
- Hold on, Murdoch.
Crabtree may be onto something.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.153
The board of control
oversees lucrative contracts

29:40.445 --> 29:41.867
worth millions of dollars.

29:42.155 --> 29:44.328
There are powerful interests
at stake.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.163
Right, then, George.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.954
Bring in alderman Ketchem
for a conversation.

29:49.246 --> 29:50.418
Sir.

29:50.706 --> 29:53.425
- Who were you speaking with
in this photograph?

29:53.709 --> 29:55.928
I don't know his name.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.088
What were you talking about?

29:58.380 --> 30:00.257
I don't recall, why?

30:00.549 --> 30:02.017
He's a suspect in this case.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.554
- I thought you had
your suspect.

30:04.845 --> 30:08.270
- We believe more than
one person was involved.

30:08.557 --> 30:10.230
What were you pointing at'?

30:11.601 --> 30:13.148
I don't remember.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.439
- It was the open window
the shot came from,

30:15.731 --> 30:17.733
before it even happened.

30:19.651 --> 30:23.281
- Are you suggesting Ä± somehow
had foreknowledge of this'?

30:23.572 --> 30:26.325
- The mayor wanted to break up
the board of control.

30:26.616 --> 30:29.665
As a controller. You stood
to lose a great deal of power.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.924
Even if one were to accept
your absurd premise,

30:35.208 --> 30:38.803
I'd have been no further ahead
by killing the mayor.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.179
How’s that'?

30:40.464 --> 30:43.468
- His replacement would
have been the head controller,

30:43.759 --> 30:45.261
Alek Hidell.

30:45.552 --> 30:49.182
Alek wanted to break up
the board loo.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.937
- Could they both
have been targeted?

30:55.228 --> 30:56.525
With a single bullet, sin'?

30:56.813 --> 30:59.612
Two birds with one stone.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.402
- Even if it were
physically possible

31:01.693 --> 31:03.821
to penetrate both skulls
with a single bullet,

31:04.112 --> 31:07.286
both skulls would have to be
in perfect alignment

31:07.574 --> 31:08.534
hard enough to set up,

31:08.784 --> 31:10.224
even if the victims
we’re cooperating.

31:10.327 --> 31:11.203
And why bother'?

31:11.495 --> 31:13.122
If the intention
was to kill both,

31:13.413 --> 31:15.632
then why not simply
keep shooting

31:15.916 --> 31:17.793
until the task was done?

31:40.440 --> 31:41.316
The bullet entered

31:41.608 --> 31:43.656
the right side
of alderman Hidell's skull.

31:43.944 --> 31:46.868
Now that we've removed
the calvaria, the skull cap,

31:47.155 --> 31:48.623
and pulled back the dura,

31:48.907 --> 31:50.375
you can see that the bullet

31:50.659 --> 31:51.980
traveled in a downward
trajectory,

31:52.202 --> 31:53.829
stopping just above
the left ear.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.499
- It's that downward angle
that troubles me.

31:56.790 --> 31:59.134
It's inconsistent
with the bullet's trajectory

31:59.418 --> 32:00.670
through the mayors hat.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.213
Well, Dr. grace speculated

32:02.504 --> 32:03.944
that his head was tilted
to the right

32:04.172 --> 32:05.344
at the moment of impact.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.055
But it wasn't.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.687
You see,
both men are facing forward

32:10.971 --> 32:12.143
just prior to the shot

32:12.431 --> 32:13.728
my goodness, you're right.

32:14.015 --> 32:14.811
Now watch.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.477
As the bullet strikes,

32:16.768 --> 32:18.896
the mayors hat pitches forward
and to the right,

32:19.187 --> 32:22.942
and alderman Hidell's head
goes back and to the left.

32:28.029 --> 32:30.077
- It's as if the bullet entered
from this side,

32:30.365 --> 32:31.366
reversed direction,

32:31.658 --> 32:33.660
and instantaneously
went through Hidell's head.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.329
A magic bullet.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.373
- Or there were two shots
coming from opposite directions.

32:38.665 --> 32:39.587
Impossible.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.155
Both men are seated
side by side.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.299
To shoot one, you would have
to shoot the other.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.350
Unless...

32:53.180 --> 32:55.478
Julia, this photograph was taken

32:55.765 --> 32:58.314
at the exact same moment
as this frame,

32:58.602 --> 33:00.570
but from
a slightly different angle.

33:00.854 --> 33:04.279
If we were lo merge the two
using a stereoscope...

33:04.566 --> 33:06.989
- You could reproduce
the illusion of depth.

33:07.277 --> 33:09.245
Very clever, William.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.849
Julia. Have a look.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.030
Oh, my goodness!

33:49.903 --> 33:51.120
Look, William.

33:51.404 --> 33:53.084
They're not sitting side by side
after all.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.078
They couldn't have been shot
by the same bullet.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.119
- No, the bullet
that killed Hidell

33:57.410 --> 33:58.832
came from the left.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.498
And the bullet that went through
the mayor's hat

34:01.790 --> 34:03.042
must have come from the right.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.300
You were right

34:04.584 --> 34:06.586
there were two shooters
after all.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.097
You never cease to amaze, Julia.

34:10.422 --> 34:12.471
We've always made a good team.

34:25.355 --> 34:26.697
- Two shooters'?
- Yes, sir.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.734
The bullet that killed
alderman Hidell

34:29.025 --> 34:30.697
came from
Clay Miller's building,

34:30.985 --> 34:33.065
but the bullet that passed
through the mayor's hat...

34:33.112 --> 34:34.914
- Actually came
from behind the packing crates

34:34.947 --> 34:36.309
on the other side
of the courtyard.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.291
Exactly, George.

34:37.576 --> 34:40.830
Sir, what Ä± assumed was an echo
was, in fact, a second shot,

34:41.121 --> 34:43.081
which would explain the angle
of the bullet's path

34:43.331 --> 34:44.503
through Hidell's skull.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.259
It didn't come
from the second floor.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.295
It came from the third floor.

34:48.587 --> 34:49.884
- So who else
was in the building

34:50.170 --> 34:51.592
other than that old girl?

34:51.880 --> 34:53.349
- You say you were
on the third floor

34:53.632 --> 34:55.931
at the time of the shooting,
and yet you saw nothing.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.562
That's true.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.689
- What were you even
doing there at that time?

34:59.973 --> 35:01.896
I thought Mr., Miller
gave his employees time off

35:02.183 --> 35:03.400
to watch the parade.

35:03.685 --> 35:06.188
- Just the office folk,
I'm the janitor.

35:06.479 --> 35:07.446
<i>. Oh.</i>

35:07.731 --> 35:09.904
And how long have you been
at the job, Mr. bowers?

35:10.191 --> 35:12.694
- Mr., Miller hired me
two weeks ago.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.156
Is he our triggerman?

35:16.448 --> 35:19.372
- One of them, Ä± believe,
but we have no proof.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.333
- What's the plan, then?
Keep the janitor in custody'?

35:22.621 --> 35:23.497
<i>For now.</i>

35:23.788 --> 35:25.131
George and Henry
are going through his room.

35:25.415 --> 35:28.715
In the meantime, sir. I find it
curious that Clay Miller

35:29.002 --> 35:32.097
is connected to this incident
in so many different ways.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.347
Mm.

35:33.632 --> 35:34.508
That's right.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.479
I hired Leonard bowers
about two weeks ago.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.098
Good worker.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.947
- Why was he not given
the same time off

35:40.096 --> 35:41.473
as your other employees?

35:41.765 --> 35:45.065
- He was.
I suppose Ä± forgot to tell him.

35:46.770 --> 35:50.024
- Mr. Miller, you had a carpet
cleaned and delivered

35:50.315 --> 35:53.910
by a supposed assassin
at a very specific time.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.741
You took the photograph
that proved

35:56.029 --> 35:58.999
that man was in that building
at that time.

35:59.282 --> 36:01.956
Haven't we discussed this?

36:02.243 --> 36:03.836
Liam Cuddy wasn't the shooter.

36:04.120 --> 36:08.842
Our prime suspect is now the man
you hired barely two weeks ago,

36:09.125 --> 36:11.093
the same man
that remained in the building

36:11.378 --> 36:14.382
when all of your other employees
went outside.

36:17.384 --> 36:18.806
Are you suggesting

36:19.094 --> 36:21.597
Ä± conspired to kill
mayor Hopkins?

36:21.888 --> 36:24.641
- Mayor Hopkins
and alderman Hidell, yes.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.731
I don't even know Hidell.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.770
And the mayor'?

36:29.062 --> 36:30.439
He's one of my closest friends.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.199
Hell, Ä± funded his campaign.

36:35.485 --> 36:38.034
He's not my only friend either.
I have a lot of friends.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.619
Ask your chief constable.
He's one of them.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.004
Sir. A moment'?

36:47.622 --> 36:49.920
Have a seat, Mr. Miller.

36:53.461 --> 36:54.941
- Retrieved from
Leonard bowers' room.

36:55.130 --> 36:56.347
It's a center-fire 30-30.

36:56.631 --> 36:57.591
We also found this, sir.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.514
It's a membership card
for the Toronto rifle club.

36:59.801 --> 37:00.846
Very good, George.

37:00.847 --> 37:01.885
That's not all, sir.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.207
Guess who else
was a member there?

37:03.263 --> 37:05.857
- Enlighten me,
- Shoeless Jack Leary.

37:08.393 --> 37:11.317
- So we were
in the same riï¬‚e club.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.151
What of it'?

37:13.440 --> 37:16.660
- You also know
alderman Ketchem.

37:18.820 --> 37:21.494
What were you two
talking about there?

37:21.781 --> 37:23.875
I don't remember.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.454
What's he pointing at?

37:32.500 --> 37:33.547
Pigeons.

37:33.835 --> 37:37.055
- Pigeons?
- Now Ä± remember.

37:37.338 --> 37:40.592
We had a nice conversation
about pigeons.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.932
Interesting fact:

37:43.219 --> 37:46.393
Did you know that pigeons
mate for life?

37:48.016 --> 37:49.393
- We've got nothing
that will support a charge

37:49.684 --> 37:51.778
and less than a day
to hold them.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.358
Oh, bloody hell.

37:59.486 --> 38:01.329
- And that's your case
against these men?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.786
Are you both mad?

38:04.073 --> 38:07.953
- Sir, Ä±-
- Let me summarize, if Ä± may.

38:08.244 --> 38:10.872
You've arrested a man because
he was a member of a gun club.

38:11.164 --> 38:12.507
You've arrested another man

38:12.791 --> 38:15.089
because he was a member
of the same gun club.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.720
Oh, and he once
wore socks outdoors.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.347
You suspect Clay Miller

38:19.631 --> 38:21.304
because he had
his carpet cleaned.

38:21.591 --> 38:23.639
And alderman Ketchem
is clearly a suspect

38:23.927 --> 38:25.895
because he points at pigeons.

38:26.179 --> 38:28.056
Am Ä± missing anything here?

38:28.348 --> 38:30.108
- Sir, the fact that
there were two shooters-

38:30.350 --> 38:32.819
- tells me that there's
one other person involved.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.695
One, not the Baker's dozen

38:34.979 --> 38:36.652
that you seem intent
on conjuring.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.380
- So who is
the second shooter, then?

38:38.566 --> 38:40.568
- Someone from the catholic
community, obviously.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.181
They were the ones
making threats.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.325
Against the mayor.

38:43.613 --> 38:45.081
Why target alderman Hidell?

38:45.365 --> 38:46.833
I don't know.

38:47.116 --> 38:49.539
But what Ä± do know is that
your evidence against these men

38:49.828 --> 38:51.796
is laughably inadequate.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.466
He's right, you know.

38:59.754 --> 39:02.132
We don't have enough evidence
to hold them much longer.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.176
Bloody hell.

39:05.468 --> 39:08.187
We'll be releasing them
just before the parade.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.519
This might sound like
a daft question, Murdoch,

39:10.807 --> 39:12.650
but do you care for a drink?

39:12.934 --> 39:14.561
Thank you, no.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.231
- I thought the klondike might
have loosened you up a bit.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.489
It'd do you good.

39:27.156 --> 39:29.500
Well, that's my philosophy,
anyway.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.464
Whenever there's time,
always have a drink.

39:31.744 --> 39:32.870
That's what Ä± say.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.442
Especially
with that bloody Giles

39:34.497 --> 39:35.749
snooping around all the time.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.168
He has us on notice, Murdoch.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.142
Live for the present.
That's what Ä± say.

39:46.426 --> 39:48.019
'Cause one never knows.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.273
Sir.

39:56.561 --> 39:57.841
Both shots were meant
to coincide

39:58.104 --> 39:59.731
with the twelfth stroke of noon.

40:00.023 --> 40:01.525
Why?

40:01.816 --> 40:04.194
- To make us think there was
just one shot, Ä± suppose.

40:04.485 --> 40:05.987
- But why'?
Why was it necessary')

40:06.279 --> 40:07.701
Well, to make us think that-

40:07.989 --> 40:09.991
bloody hell, Murdoch.

40:10.283 --> 40:12.627
- They wanted us to think
they were shooting at the mayor.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.712
- When, in fact,
they were shooting at Hidell.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.168
And only Hidell.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.129
- But why go
to all that trouble?

40:18.416 --> 40:20.456
Why not just bash him
over the head in a dark alley?

40:20.710 --> 40:23.964
- They wanted alderman Hidell's
death to appear accidental,

40:24.255 --> 40:26.678
<i>as though he were struck
by a misguided bullet</i>

40:26.966 --> 40:28.468
intended for the mayor.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.307
So what's the motive?

40:30.595 --> 40:32.893
- Alderman Hidell
was the head controller, sir.

40:33.181 --> 40:35.934
The head controller
reviews all city contracts.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.853
Perhaps he stumbled
across something.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.280
George!

40:41.564 --> 40:42.565
Sir.

40:42.857 --> 40:44.325
Bring in all of Hidell's files

40:44.609 --> 40:46.862
and subpoena
Ketchem's files as well.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.325
At this time of night, sir?

40:48.613 --> 40:50.615
- Wake up a judge
if you have to.

41:28.695 --> 41:29.912
Sir.

41:30.196 --> 41:31.413
What have you, George?

41:31.698 --> 41:32.540
An undertaking

41:32.824 --> 41:33.871
by the city-owned
Toronto waterworks

41:34.158 --> 41:35.501
to expand the city's pipelines.

41:35.785 --> 41:36.752
Guess who was awarded
the contract

41:37.036 --> 41:37.957
to oversee the project.

41:38.204 --> 41:39.046
Clay Miller.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.370
And the contractor hired

41:40.498 --> 41:42.842
to build the sewers
and water supply lines was...

41:43.126 --> 41:44.924
Sean Gallagher.

41:45.211 --> 41:47.589
George, who authorized
this project'?

41:47.880 --> 41:49.006
Alderman Ketchem.

41:49.298 --> 41:53.724
- You allocated over $600,000
of taxpayer money

41:54.012 --> 41:55.559
to a waterworks initiative.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.849
That seems
a bit excessive to me.

41:58.141 --> 41:59.814
Is that so, detective?

42:00.101 --> 42:02.103
I didn't know you were an expert

42:02.395 --> 42:05.239
on the costs
of city infrastructure.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.900
<i>I'm not.</i>

42:07.191 --> 42:09.614
But Clay Miller
was the highest bidder,

42:09.902 --> 42:11.996
and you awarded him
the contract.

42:12.280 --> 42:15.204
I imagine some pockets
were lined with that.

42:15.491 --> 42:18.665
This deal is rife
with corruption,

42:18.953 --> 42:20.274
and your colleague
alderman Hidell

42:20.496 --> 42:21.338
found out about it.

42:21.622 --> 42:22.999
You have no proof.

42:23.291 --> 42:26.044
- I have
alderman Hidell's files.

42:26.335 --> 42:27.896
Something Ä± never
would have looked into

42:28.087 --> 42:29.760
had his death been an accident.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.392
But it was murder,

42:32.675 --> 42:35.303
and you will be going to jail.

42:37.221 --> 42:40.316
- You can follow this trail
as far as you want, detective,

42:40.600 --> 42:45.026
but you will never pin
Hidell's murder on me.

42:47.523 --> 42:49.992
- We have a motive, sir,
- Yes, a motive.

42:50.276 --> 42:53.155
But all our evidence
is entirely circumstantial.

42:53.446 --> 42:54.868
We need a confession, Murdoch.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.909
- Sir, Ä± think Ä± know
how to get one.

42:59.452 --> 43:01.705
- Mr. Gallagher,
we know you're involved.

43:01.996 --> 43:04.124
If you're willing to talk,
we'll make a deal.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.695
- You wouldn't
be offering a deal

43:05.750 --> 43:07.343
if you had any evidence.

43:07.627 --> 43:08.674
Perhaps.

43:08.961 --> 43:10.929
But that's the trouble
with conspiracies.

43:11.214 --> 43:13.254
The chances of getting caught
increase exponentially

43:13.508 --> 43:15.260
with every added person
involved.

43:15.551 --> 43:17.519
- How many were involved
in this?

43:17.804 --> 43:19.351
Alderman Ketchem, Clay Miller,

43:19.639 --> 43:20.811
the two shooters.

43:21.099 --> 43:23.852
- And that's just the ones
we know about thus far.

43:24.143 --> 43:26.145
- It only takes
one person to talk

43:26.437 --> 43:28.565
and if that's not you, Sean,

43:28.856 --> 43:31.575
the noose goes
round your neck as well.

43:38.074 --> 43:40.202
What kind of deal?

43:43.913 --> 43:45.586
They needed a patsy.

43:45.873 --> 43:48.342
- And who better than
a known catholic rabble-rouser

43:48.626 --> 43:51.004
to deflect the real reason
for the assassination?

43:51.295 --> 43:53.218
- How did you find
your shooters?

43:53.506 --> 43:55.179
Clay Miller knew one of them.

43:55.466 --> 43:56.683
He'd hunted with him.

43:56.968 --> 43:59.938
Said he was the best shot
he'd ever seen.

44:00.221 --> 44:01.941
<i>Miller said the best place</i>

44:02.098 --> 44:03.600
<i>to do it was during the parade.</i>

44:03.891 --> 44:06.132
<i>What with (He death threats
the mayor had been receiving,</i>

44:06.352 --> 44:07.473
<i>"he was sure the police."...</i>

44:07.478 --> 44:09.230
It was all Clay Millers idea.

44:09.522 --> 44:10.944
<i>And not look our way at all.</i>

44:11.232 --> 44:13.735
<i>It was a foolproof plan.</i>

44:17.780 --> 44:19.101
- Well, gentlemen,
it would appear

44:19.282 --> 44:21.751
that you were right,
and Ä± was wrong.

44:22.910 --> 44:24.503
That's big of you to admit.

44:24.787 --> 44:26.960
- So Ä± suppose we can continue
with murder charges

44:27.248 --> 44:29.546
against alderman Ketchem,
Clay Miller,

44:29.834 --> 44:32.883
and our two shooters,
bowers and Leary.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.515
- But not Sean Gallagher,
as per his plea bargain.

44:35.798 --> 44:36.840
Yes.

44:36.841 --> 44:39.469
That's a pity that a guilty person
has to go free.

44:40.887 --> 44:43.481
But that does
tend to happen here, doesn't it?

44:43.764 --> 44:46.313
Gallagher is not free, sir.

44:46.601 --> 44:49.445
He framed a member
of his own community for murder.

44:49.729 --> 44:52.027
They'll likely kill him
before the others hang.

44:52.315 --> 44:54.909
- At the very least,
he's a ruined man.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.195
Sounds like justice to me.

45:04.577 --> 45:06.079
Julia.

45:06.370 --> 45:08.213
- I hear you've solved
your case.

45:08.497 --> 45:11.091
- Thanks in a large part to you,
as per usual'

45:11.375 --> 45:13.218
yes, well,

45:13.502 --> 45:16.551
I'm afraid you'll have to rely
on Dr. grace from now on.

45:16.839 --> 45:19.092
I beg your pardon.

45:20.718 --> 45:22.686
I'm leaving, William.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.481
I've decided to set up
my own private practice

45:26.641 --> 45:28.689
here in Toronto.

45:30.978 --> 45:31.818
Are you quite sure?

45:32.063 --> 45:35.158
Your value here is-
- We both know why, William.

45:36.901 --> 45:38.153
If we'd forgotten,

45:38.444 --> 45:41.118
we were reminded of it
the last few days.

45:42.990 --> 45:45.038
I just can't.

45:48.329 --> 45:51.173
I'd hoped to leave
before your suspension was up.

45:51.457 --> 45:54.085
But Ä± had so much to teach
Dr. grace, and...

45:54.377 --> 45:56.721
