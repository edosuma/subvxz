He's my mucholder
sister's kid.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.205
So be good to him, okay?

09:57.248 --> 09:59.642
But not like too good.
No special treatment.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.296
I don't know what I'm saying.
Special treatment's fine.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.428
What were you gonna say

10:03.472 --> 10:05.866
Ooh, hold that thought.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.389
Yeah? Go for Weitz.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.871
Sorry? It sounds like
you're say--

10:10.914 --> 10:13.874
That is what you're saying?
And you sent her down here?

10:13.917 --> 10:14.875
Why

10:14.918 --> 10:17.834
♪♪

10:23.361 --> 10:25.886
What the hell is
Madeline Burke doing here?

10:25.929 --> 10:29.846
♪♪

10:33.545 --> 10:36.418
♪♪

10:48.648 --> 10:49.866
If you'll excuse me,
I would love

10:49.910 --> 10:51.520
to loop in
some of my team.
Yeah.

10:51.563 --> 10:53.087
Is that Madeline Burke?

10:53.130 --> 10:55.393
Yeah, what do you
think she wants?

10:55.437 --> 10:56.917
Whatever it is,
it can't be good.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.092
You think she knows
we're investigating her?

10:58.135 --> 10:59.702
She definitely knows.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.835
When the team comes back,
I want us to make sure...

11:06.753 --> 11:08.929
What happened?

11:08.972 --> 11:10.887
Well, we showed up

11:10.931 --> 11:13.194
at the bomber's address and,
uh, all hell broke loose.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.935
We grabbed him,
but not before he triggered

11:14.978 --> 11:16.197
a self-destruct protocol.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.720
Whole house blew sky high.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.983
What's with all the paint?
You look like a Jackson Pollack.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.811
Weller tackled us
into the garage.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.726
The bomber had a wall
full of old paint cans

11:23.770 --> 11:24.727
that buffered us
from the blast.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.773
What's with
the feathers here?

11:26.816 --> 11:28.862
He also had chickens.That sounds like
the greatest takedown

11:28.905 --> 11:30.559
in FBI history.
I'm so sorry I missed it.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.343
We found the bomber's phone
in the wreckage,

11:32.387 --> 11:34.171
So can you pull
the data off that?

11:34.215 --> 11:37.609
It's just...

11:39.133 --> 11:40.308
Oh, that part's
not a joke.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.745
No.
Okay, great.
Terrific.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.225
Thundercats, ho!

11:44.268 --> 11:46.009
Have fun.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.577
Anywho, we have to deal
with our special guest.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.361
Might be our only shot
at this, so...

11:50.405 --> 11:52.450
it is unfortunate
that you look like that.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.975
What the hell is
Madeline Burke doing here?

11:55.018 --> 11:56.237
She just showed up.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.673
What does she want?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.893
There's only one way
to find out.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.635
Am I interrupting something?

12:04.985 --> 12:06.987
How can we help you,
Miss Burke?

12:07.030 --> 12:08.684
Actually, I'm here
to help you.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.818
I have recently come across
some disturbing information

12:11.861 --> 12:14.951
regarding Hank Crawford
in his time spent at HCI Global.

12:14.995 --> 12:18.476
It seems that a few
of our company accounts

12:18.520 --> 12:20.870
and subsidiaries have links

12:20.914 --> 12:23.786
to extensive
international corruption.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.048
You don't say.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.138
The Crawford era
is a black mark

12:28.182 --> 12:29.792
for everyone.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.881
But I'm here to spearhead

12:31.925 --> 12:34.405
a new era of transparency.How so?

12:34.449 --> 12:36.233
By giving you the proof
you've been hunting for,

12:36.277 --> 12:38.453
and I'm delivering it
in person

12:38.496 --> 12:41.804
as a gesture of goodwill
and cooperation.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.502
That's very generous of you.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.462
Sit tight.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.858
I mean, I'm just
gonna say it.

12:51.901 --> 12:54.208
There's for sure a virus
on this hard drive.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.906
We'll need
an air gapped computer.
Yeah.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.039
Real quick, remind me
what that is?

12:59.082 --> 13:00.823
Secure laptop that's
isolated from the Internet.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.695
Whatever.
I'm gonna get an IT tech

13:03.739 --> 13:05.045
to bring one to you.

13:05.088 --> 13:06.655
I need you guys to
interrogate that bomber.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.700
He blew up his house.
He's clearly hiding something.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.267
One of us should stay
with Madeline.
Yep.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.878
I'm gonna handle that.

13:11.921 --> 13:13.705
Okay, let's get out there
and nail this

13:13.749 --> 13:15.707
for our Quantico
friends, yeah?

13:15.751 --> 13:18.232
Oh! Oh, I almost forgot.
I got this great idea.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.407
So, you know how,
uh, we can't send

13:19.450 --> 13:21.061
the recruits out
into the field?

13:21.104 --> 13:24.978
Well, what if we found a way
to bring the field to them?

13:25.021 --> 13:27.023
Such as?

13:27.067 --> 13:28.851
Like little videos!
Like, little-- little craz--

13:28.895 --> 13:30.897
little, little FaceTime--
FaceTimesy video.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.246
You'll figure it out.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.248
Come on, let's remind
these kids

13:34.291 --> 13:36.119
how exciting it is
to be an FBI agent.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.861
Yeah? All right!

13:38.905 --> 13:39.862
I mean,
we can't really...

13:39.906 --> 13:41.733
Okay.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.738
America's too big now.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.262
Too complicated.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.742
Okay, so our friend Ted here

13:50.786 --> 13:53.876
clearly has some very big
feelings about globalization.

13:53.920 --> 13:54.921
And the fact that
he blew up his house

13:54.964 --> 13:56.444
while our team tried
to arrest him

13:56.487 --> 13:57.880
doesn't bode well
for the rest of our day.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.317
You think that he was trying
to hide an active threat?

14:00.361 --> 14:04.931
Hundred percent.
Uh, can I talk to you
for just a second?

14:08.848 --> 14:09.936
You didn't think to mention

14:09.979 --> 14:12.025
that the director of the FBI
is your uncle?

14:12.068 --> 14:13.548
Do you think I want
people knowing that?

14:13.591 --> 14:15.115
That would've been
nice to know, yeah.

14:15.158 --> 14:15.985
All right,
he's been in the Bureau

14:16.029 --> 14:17.508
for, like,
five minutes.

14:17.552 --> 14:20.076
I've wanted to be FBI
since I was a kid.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.251
I don't want people thinking

14:21.295 --> 14:22.731
that I've had
anything handed to me.

14:22.774 --> 14:23.950
You really didn't know
who I was?

14:23.993 --> 14:25.952
Cross my heart,
I just thought

14:25.995 --> 14:28.041
you were smart
and funny

14:28.084 --> 14:30.130
and super hot.

14:30.173 --> 14:33.611
Okay, that's...
a very nice thing to say.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.091
Um, okay.

14:35.135 --> 14:38.965
Let us keep this
professional.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.618
No one can know.
We're gonna keep it quiet.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.577
And we're not gonna
tell your uncle,

14:42.620 --> 14:43.970
not gonna tell the recruits,

14:44.013 --> 14:48.496
and especially not my team,
but especially...

14:48.539 --> 14:51.281
Rich.
This is Rich DotCom.

14:51.325 --> 14:52.369
I thought you
were observing.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.545
I am, and...

14:54.589 --> 14:56.373
I was, but-- I was.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.593
But you're both out here.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.290
Oh, hello.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.858
Hi.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.947
How's it going
with the bomber?He just lawyered up.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.297
Yeah, this is some
Oklahoma City,
Unabomber stuff.

15:07.341 --> 15:10.518
Any luck with the phone?Against all odds, yes.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.999
You know Ted Henwood.
Meet Larry Mills.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.652
Turns out that Ted
the Michelangelo Bomber

15:14.696 --> 15:16.306
is actually Larry and Ted,

15:16.350 --> 15:19.179
the Michelangelo's Bombers
plural.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.528
Care to explain how

15:20.571 --> 15:22.312
No time. We found him
at his place of business

15:22.356 --> 15:25.098
at the Beachwood Inn
in Coney Island, so...

15:25.141 --> 15:26.186
Good work, let's move.
Thank you.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.144
Whoa, hang on.
You can't just--

15:28.188 --> 15:30.190
He said "good work,
let's move," okay?

15:30.233 --> 15:32.148
They gotta go,
there's a bomber who bombs.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.976
Yeah. We're-- we're good.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.544
♪♪

15:36.587 --> 15:38.024
Uh, okay.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.200
So, for the benefit
of our guests,

15:40.243 --> 15:43.203
could you please
show how you came
to these conclusions?

15:43.246 --> 15:45.161
Riley, notes.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.337
Most of the phone's data
was destroyed

15:47.381 --> 15:49.470
and what was there
was incredibly fragmented.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.385
But through a variety
of digital forensics,

15:51.428 --> 15:53.474
including an analysis
of proprietary storage...

15:53.517 --> 15:54.997
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it, I get it.

15:55.041 --> 15:58.000
Okay, um, we discovered
the suspect in custody,

15:58.044 --> 16:00.437
Ted, sent a text message
to another man, Larry,

16:00.481 --> 16:03.266
which said, "We're burned.
Get to 426. Charlie Mike."

16:03.310 --> 16:05.486
426 is the address
of the hotel?

16:05.529 --> 16:07.401
Yes, Larry's
a maintenance man,

16:07.444 --> 16:09.229
which is odd
for a few reasons.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.796
One, he clocked into work
after Ted was captured.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.494
Two, we dug into Larry

16:13.537 --> 16:15.235
and discovered he's ex-Army

16:15.278 --> 16:16.236
and has
an engineering degree.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.064
He's way over-qualified.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.501
What's Charlie Mike?I was just getting to that.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.590
It's Army slang for
"continue mission."

16:22.633 --> 16:24.070
Okay, so we found
a second suspect,

16:24.113 --> 16:26.028
we know where he is,
that's why they moved.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.247
Any other questions?

16:27.290 --> 16:28.726
Any thoughts
as to motive?

16:28.770 --> 16:30.598
You know, I figure
he's probably an angry man

16:30.641 --> 16:32.861
with a victim complex--
that's a dangerous combination.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.255
Look at this--
Larry was a combat engineer

16:35.298 --> 16:36.865
with a federal
explosives license

16:36.908 --> 16:38.127
for a demolition company.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.259
Let's loop in Reade.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.217
What's up, Patterson?

16:41.261 --> 16:43.045
About a year ago,
Larry purchased

16:43.089 --> 16:45.308
a thousand pounds
of demolition explosives.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.093
Ted's house was rigged
with the same kind.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.660
It would only take
50 pounds to level the house.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.880
That leaves 950
still out there.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.490
When did Larry start
working at the hotel?

16:53.534 --> 16:55.057
About a year ago,
but I don't think

16:55.101 --> 16:57.146
this is a regular day
for him.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.104
I think he's gonna
blow it up.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.587
And that'swhy
you show your work.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.898
NYPD's in the loop,
they have an APB out on Larry,

17:09.941 --> 17:11.769
and the hotel is
already being evacuated.

17:11.813 --> 17:13.119
Good, where's the bomb squad?

17:13.162 --> 17:15.121
Uh, get this. They are
already at the hotel

17:15.164 --> 17:16.905
waiting for you--
which never happens.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.211
They're usually stuck
in traffic or something.

17:18.254 --> 17:21.127
They're the worst.Whoo-hoo-hoo! Love it!

17:21.170 --> 17:23.085
How's that for the field agent
experience, right?

17:23.129 --> 17:24.869
So visceral.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.567
What's your ETA? We're on the turnpike.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.090
About eight minutes away.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.744
It looks like
you're driving super fast.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.572
Are you on the shoulder? If it's all the same,

17:31.615 --> 17:33.748
I would just love for him
to concentrate on the road.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.185
Oh, dear. Rude.

17:36.229 --> 17:39.319
Well, that's exciting, huh?

17:39.362 --> 17:41.147
Anyway, this is
for you two.Ahh.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.887
Your one
air gap thingy--Hey-hey!

17:42.931 --> 17:44.106
and one of this guy.Thank you.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.238
Want an update
on that pronto.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.326
Yes, boss.

17:46.369 --> 17:47.588
And this is for you.

17:47.631 --> 17:48.937
I see you over here.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.286
How you doin'?
Bring it in.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.375
Yeah, how's my
favorite nephew?

17:52.419 --> 17:54.334
They treating you all right?
Not riding you too hard?

17:54.377 --> 17:56.336
I'm just joking.
I want you on him.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.251
I want you on him all da--
you all right

17:58.294 --> 18:01.210
Watch out for her,
she's a dynamo.

18:01.254 --> 18:04.953
Anyway, welcome, huh?

18:09.218 --> 18:11.829
S... uh...
What is that over here?

18:15.355 --> 18:17.226
Hey, what's
with you today?

18:17.270 --> 18:18.401
Nothing, fine.
I'm fine.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.360
What's going on with
Madeline's hard drive?

18:20.403 --> 18:22.231
What kind of virus is it?There isn't one.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.276
And all these files
line up

18:23.319 --> 18:24.625
with the HCI
Global corruption

18:24.668 --> 18:25.756
that we've already
corroborated.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.018
This is legit. Okay.

18:27.062 --> 18:28.759
So let's cross check it

18:28.803 --> 18:30.021
with the tattoo
database then.

18:30.065 --> 18:31.849
Oh, boy, okay.
That sounds like

18:31.893 --> 18:33.938
the kind of tedious,
time-consuming work

18:33.982 --> 18:36.376
that Afreen would
probably love to do.

18:36.419 --> 18:40.771
Am I rightUh, I-- totally.

18:40.815 --> 18:43.339
And take it somewhere
private, because these
are very sensitive files.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.385
I am all over this.I mean, go nuts.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.604
Just corroborate and
collate and color-code--

18:47.648 --> 18:49.215
All right, she's gone.Yeah, okay.

18:49.258 --> 18:52.348
Now that we got a few
minutes before the team

18:52.392 --> 18:53.567
reaches the hotel,
who's your favorite recruit?

18:53.610 --> 18:56.091
No one.
I don't play favorites.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.746
Oh yeah?
What about Lincoln?

18:58.789 --> 19:00.400
Uh, which

19:00.443 --> 19:02.967
The slab of man-ham
that you pulled out

19:03.011 --> 19:04.665
of our conference room
earlier today.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.407
You are unprofessional.Oh, yeah?

19:07.450 --> 19:09.409
Would an unprofessional
do something like this?

19:11.628 --> 19:13.195
What the hell is that?

19:13.239 --> 19:14.849
Well, after our
tête-à-tête this morning

19:14.892 --> 19:16.416
about the Book of Secrets,
I did a bit more research,

19:16.459 --> 19:17.852
and it turns out the
evidence is out there

19:17.895 --> 19:20.246
that proves it's not
only real, but that it...

19:20.289 --> 19:23.205
This research is extensive.

19:23.249 --> 19:26.861
There is no way you did
all of this this morning.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.863
What is your angle?

19:28.906 --> 19:31.431
Okay, promise
you won't scoff?

19:31.474 --> 19:34.912
I can already tell you
that I'm gonna scoff.

19:34.956 --> 19:36.479
I've been pursuing
the Book of Secrets

19:36.523 --> 19:38.264
for years on the dark web.

19:38.307 --> 19:39.395
It's kind of
my white whale.

19:39.439 --> 19:42.616
This is me scoffing.

19:42.659 --> 19:45.923
Where are you going?

19:45.967 --> 19:47.447
Just-- just be
five minutes.

19:47.490 --> 19:48.578
We're just gonna
get some juice.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.101
Excuse me.

19:50.145 --> 19:51.277
Okay, if I wanted
the silent treatment,

19:51.320 --> 19:52.452
I would go
visit my mother.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.149
Where are you going?Away from you

19:54.193 --> 19:55.716
and to give Weitz
the update, pronto.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.108
You know, I don't know why
everyone rags on that guy.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.284
I think he's pretty cool,

19:58.327 --> 20:00.111
and he's got
a fantastic head of hair.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.504
Why don't you wanna talk
about the Book of Secrets?

20:01.548 --> 20:03.245
Because I am
a scientist.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.899
Why are you
buying into it?

20:04.942 --> 20:07.118
Because if it's real,
it's worth a fortune.

20:07.162 --> 20:09.382
Also, Jane is dying--
that's my main reason now.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.297
Exactly.
Jane is dying.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.168
Which is why we shouldn't
go chasing a myth.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.256
Why would Roman
put it in the cache

20:14.300 --> 20:15.388
if he didn't want us
to find it?

20:15.431 --> 20:17.520
Well, maybe
it's a red herring.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.957
Oh, I don't think so, I mean,
Roman might be a little...

20:20.001 --> 20:22.612
...but he never did
anything without a reason.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.919
He's distracting you
with snake oil.

20:24.962 --> 20:26.355
We need to be using
real science

20:26.399 --> 20:27.400
to find a real cure.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.880
Or, more likely,
he somehow found out

20:29.924 --> 20:31.491
about my obsession
with the Book of Secrets

20:31.534 --> 20:32.492
and planted it in there
knowing I would

20:32.535 --> 20:34.058
get it across
the finish line.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.364
That's your more
likely scenario?

20:35.408 --> 20:36.974
The Book of Secrets
is out there

20:37.018 --> 20:39.629
just waiting to be found,
I can feel it in my bones.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.936
Sometimes you just gotta
take a leap of faith.

20:48.421 --> 20:49.726
Where are we
with the bombers?

20:49.770 --> 20:51.728
Uh, the NYPD is still
searching the hotel.

20:51.772 --> 20:54.078
The team should be
pulling up any second.
I got them on the comms.

20:54.122 --> 20:58.169
Great, great, great, great.
Um, who's the best recruit?

20:58.213 --> 20:59.519
Is it Lincoln?
Lincoln, right?

20:59.562 --> 21:00.694
Lincoln's pretty good?

21:00.737 --> 21:02.522
Patterson likes Lincoln
quite a bit.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.741
Oh, perfect because, um,

21:04.785 --> 21:07.004
I need to make assignment
recommendations,

21:07.048 --> 21:08.310
and I wanna give him
the best one.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.398
But obviously,
I'm his uncle,

21:09.442 --> 21:11.313
so I need someone objective

21:11.357 --> 21:13.010
to say that he's better
than everybody else.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.142
Somebody like you.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.971
He's good.

21:17.014 --> 21:19.147
But Riley is good, too.

21:19.190 --> 21:21.323
Cool, cool, cool.
So, Lincoln is good?

21:21.367 --> 21:23.194
Great, that's all I need
to hear. Thank you.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.332
Why did you say
I like Lincoln?

21:30.376 --> 21:32.552
Oh, just 'cause
he was-- he's been doing

21:32.595 --> 21:33.944
such a great job today,
you know?

21:33.988 --> 21:35.424
And, uh,
also you two have

21:35.468 --> 21:36.773
fantastic chemistry
together.

21:36.817 --> 21:39.385
I can totally see
why you slept with him.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.519
How could you
possibly know that?

21:43.563 --> 21:45.956
Oh, I didn't
until just now.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.567
I'm kidding. It's been
very evident all day.

21:47.610 --> 21:50.396
Also, I'm, like, a sex narc,
and you are terrible at lying.

21:50.439 --> 21:51.788
You can't say
anything to anybody.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.834
Why would I say anything?
I'm very thrilled for you.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.010
Are you kidding me?
It's really unprofessional.

21:56.053 --> 21:58.012
I think that's what
thrills me the most, actually.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.362
Okay, they're
at the hotel.

22:00.406 --> 22:01.537
Let's get the comms
on speakers.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.366
Field team,
what do you got for us?

22:04.410 --> 22:06.020
We just talked
to the bomb squad.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.587
The hotel's clear.
No sign of Larry.

22:07.630 --> 22:10.241
No sign of explosives. It's a Prohibition-era hotel.

22:10.285 --> 22:13.419
What if there are
still secret rooms or...Secret passages.

22:13.462 --> 22:15.029
So it looks like
there's an old

22:15.072 --> 22:17.466
booze-smuggling
tunnel in the basement.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.990
We're on our way.
Clear.

22:20.034 --> 22:21.514
Clear.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.385
Clear.

22:23.429 --> 22:24.430
Wait a second, this is
why Larry got a job

22:24.473 --> 22:25.866
as a maintenance man--
so he'd have

22:25.909 --> 22:27.563
unrestricted access
to the tunnels.

22:27.607 --> 22:28.825
Thanks for the recap.
Where does the tunnel let out?

22:28.869 --> 22:30.610
Looks like Coney Island Yard.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.960
Looks like there's an older
underground part...

22:33.003 --> 22:35.571
The tunnel's clear.
No explosives, no Larry.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.399
We're standing in a--Subway depot,
we're looking at it.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.401
Over here. A det cord
and blasting caps.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.185
Someone was in a hurry.

22:41.229 --> 22:42.883
How many trains are usually
stored down here?

22:42.926 --> 22:44.841
14, why?

22:44.885 --> 22:46.452
Uh, 'cause right now
there's zero.

22:46.495 --> 22:49.019
Oh, no.

22:50.934 --> 22:53.633
The trains are under
the city as we speak.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.199
Those explosives could be
on any one of them.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.027
Or all of them.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.116
♪♪

23:03.338 --> 23:04.731
I called in a chopper.

23:04.774 --> 23:06.210
We're headed to Midtown
to stay central.

23:06.254 --> 23:08.125
Hey, can we get
a timeline on the bomb?

23:08.169 --> 23:09.910
No, the bomber's been burned.
We have to assume it's imminent.

23:09.953 --> 23:12.782
Call when you find
the explosives.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.610
Okay, people.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.307
We have a bomber in the wind

23:16.351 --> 23:17.831
and explosives
on one or more trains

23:17.874 --> 23:18.919
that left that depot.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.660
Until we find
those 14 trains,

23:20.703 --> 23:22.226
each of these dots
is an active train

23:22.270 --> 23:23.358
that's a potential threat.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.664
Red is bad,
blue is good.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.056
Toto, we're not
in Quantico anymore.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.623
These are real lives
on the line.

23:27.667 --> 23:28.668
He's right, let's turn

23:28.711 --> 23:30.496
all these
red trains blue.Good.

23:30.539 --> 23:32.367
White House wants answers.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.064
We think this is
a chaos attack
or targeted?

23:34.108 --> 23:35.936
It feels like chaos,
but not sure yet.

23:35.979 --> 23:37.372
What if we shut down
the whole subway system

23:37.416 --> 23:38.852
and evacuate?It's not gonna happen.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.157
An evacuation will cause
mass panic,

23:40.201 --> 23:41.463
play right into
the bomber's hands.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.813
How?
What if he wants
to flush everybody

23:43.857 --> 23:45.249
out of the subway system
all at once?

23:45.293 --> 23:46.337
Why would he want that?

23:46.381 --> 23:48.905
I don't know, that's...

23:48.949 --> 23:51.255
Look, we overplay our hand,
he might cut bait,

23:51.299 --> 23:52.692
trigger the bombs early,

23:52.735 --> 23:54.694
cause as much destruction
as possible.

23:54.737 --> 23:56.043
I want you to keep
narrowing it down.

23:56.086 --> 23:57.523
I am tired of
playing "what if?"

23:57.566 --> 23:59.655
Call me when
you find the bombs.

24:01.527 --> 24:02.702
Everyone keeps saying that.

24:02.745 --> 24:05.182
Yeah, I'll just hit
the "find bomb" button.

24:05.226 --> 24:08.359
Okay, so lines
B, D, F, N, Q, and R

24:08.403 --> 24:10.579
are likely carriers
of the bombs,

24:10.623 --> 24:12.102
all of them running
from Brooklyn to Manhattan.

24:12.146 --> 24:14.496
We just got
the ID numbers

24:14.540 --> 24:17.194
on all 14 trains that started
the day at Coney Island Yard.

24:17.238 --> 24:19.066
Two of them were taken
out of service for maintenance,

24:19.109 --> 24:21.416
leaving 12 trains
across six tracks.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.896
Great work.

24:22.939 --> 24:25.202
Let's pinpoint when
each subway left the depot.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.900
If we can figure out
the speed of the trains,

24:26.943 --> 24:28.510
the time per stop,

24:28.554 --> 24:30.773
the number of stops
on each subway line...

24:30.817 --> 24:33.123
We can establish where
all 12 trains are right now.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.603
Just like
high school algebra.

24:34.647 --> 24:36.997
It's actually
middle school algebra now.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.521
Really? You guys all took
algebra in middle school?

24:39.565 --> 24:41.697
Hey, Afreen just got
something urgent.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.873
Okay, put a pin in that.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.527
Afreen, when I said
somewhere private,

24:45.571 --> 24:46.876
I didn't mean my office.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.530
Well, this is the most
private place we have.

What do you have?

24:54.057 --> 24:55.363

a familiar name.

24:57.017 --> 24:58.932
Larry Mills?

24:58.975 --> 25:00.803
You think that's our bomber?
That's a pretty common name.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.544
No, it's the same guy.

25:02.588 --> 25:06.026
Looks like he worked
at a communications company

25:06.069 --> 25:10.160
called Lasercom Technologies,
a subsidiary of HCI Global.

25:10.204 --> 25:12.598
I'll tell Weitz.Afreen, so good.

Just two of them,
but the train with the bombs

26:34.897 --> 26:36.812
is number 772
on the B line.

26:36.856 --> 26:38.814
Are you positive?
Yes.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.686
Out of those two trains,
772 was the only one

26:40.729 --> 26:43.471
that left the depot after
Larry checked into work.

26:43.514 --> 26:46.256
Let's isolate 772.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.911
We need to stop that train.

26:48.955 --> 26:50.521
What do you got?

26:50.565 --> 26:52.088
Uh, we found the explosives.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.700
They're on a train heading
into 7th Avenue Station

26:54.743 --> 26:56.658
near Prospect Park.
Where are you?

26:56.702 --> 26:58.747
We can be there
in two minutes.
Where's the bomb squad?

26:58.791 --> 27:00.575
Uh, they're stuck
in traffic

27:00.619 --> 27:02.708

Okay, people, listen up.

27:08.191 --> 27:12.935
I need the tower, the MTA,
and the NYPD on the horn ASAP.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.372
Let's do this.
Vamanos,people!

27:15.416 --> 27:17.287
It's one train.
Larry's trying to blow up

27:17.331 --> 27:19.812
an R&D lab inside
the Metzinger Tower.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.291

at the next station,
start evacuating.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.816
Yep, already on it.Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.861
You made that call
without me?

27:25.905 --> 27:27.341
We're kind
of on a clock here.

27:27.384 --> 27:29.691
Yeah, okay, fine.
That's--

27:29.735 --> 27:31.519
That's fine this one tim--
Hey, uh...

27:31.562 --> 27:32.738

okay down there?

27:34.348 --> 27:36.306

28:03.203 --> 28:05.161

28:05.205 --> 28:08.077
We did, but the brake
was overridden.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.513
Well, override
the override.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.733
That's not really an option.Where is Weller?

28:11.777 --> 28:13.213
I'm in the station
with NYPD.

28:13.256 --> 28:14.867
If the bomber's here,
we'll find him.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.825
Oh, he's for sure down there.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.609
There's a physical switch
outside this train

28:18.653 --> 28:21.003
that needs to be flipped
for the brake override.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.135
How much time do we have?

28:22.178 --> 28:23.223
Uh, calculating now.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.877
Six minutes.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.748
Are you sure?

28:26.792 --> 28:28.010
Middle school algebra's
kind of my jam.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.620
Once we found the target,
it was all about

28:29.664 --> 28:30.752
going old school
with one of my favorites,

28:30.796 --> 28:32.014
time equals distance
over speed.

Oh, my God, I just
sounded like Weller.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.236
Right, sorry, I--Here, let me see this.

28:36.279 --> 28:39.413
Uh, uh, okay.
B line train 772

28:39.456 --> 28:42.111
left the 7th Avenue Station
at 13:23:43 p.m.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.983
and travelled at a top speed
of

28:44.026 --> 28:47.247
55.446 miles per hour,
assuming there's no stops.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.465
Sorry, the writing's
a little messy.

28:48.509 --> 28:49.684
I was moving pretty fast

28:49.728 --> 28:50.859
and did a lot of
the math in my head.

28:50.903 --> 28:52.687
Hmm, well, that's where
math is done, so--

28:52.731 --> 28:53.993
Can you just check
his work, please?!

28:54.036 --> 28:57.431
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:57.474 --> 29:01.565
He's right. We have just under
six minutes to stop this attack.

29:01.609 --> 29:03.829
I make the calls.
Don't blow this.

29:03.872 --> 29:05.700
Okay, I changed my mind,
I don't like him anymore.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.571
Let's find Larry.
That's not much time.

29:07.615 --> 29:08.964
Any idea what
we're looking for?

29:09.008 --> 29:10.879
These bombers were
combat engineers

29:10.923 --> 29:12.838
so there's a good chance
that the explosives

29:12.881 --> 29:14.056
are wired to the train itself.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.797
Okay, we're gonna split up

29:15.841 --> 29:16.842
and go compartment
by compartment.

29:16.885 --> 29:17.973
Where is this guy?

29:18.017 --> 29:18.844
We do not have enough angles.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.715
I see him!

29:20.759 --> 29:22.151
He's across the platform
on the south side.

29:22.195 --> 29:23.500
Okay, does he have
a remote in his hand?

29:23.544 --> 29:24.806
No, I can't tell.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.329
He just made me.
He's running.

29:26.373 --> 29:27.853
He jumped onto the tracks.
I'm going after him.

29:27.896 --> 29:29.158
Uh, the third rail's
the bad one.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.464
Whoa, we got
an incoming train.

29:30.507 --> 29:31.857
We're in the tunnel.

right in front of me.

29:45.305 --> 29:46.741
Okay, okay, okay.
Um, um, um,

29:46.785 --> 29:48.003
does he have a remote
in his hand?

29:48.047 --> 29:49.483
Something that could
turn off the bombs?

I'm checking
what's left of him.

29:51.572 --> 29:53.617
No, nothing.
Just a backpack

29:53.661 --> 29:55.010
with a drill
and some screws.

29:55.054 --> 29:56.403
W-- what kinds
of drills and screws?

29:56.446 --> 29:58.057
I'm sending a video.

29:58.100 --> 30:01.190
Thank you, we'll compare that
with the train schematics.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.844

30:02.888 --> 30:04.280

very bad for us.

They're individually wired
behind the paneling

30:09.459 --> 30:10.939
under the seats
in the front compartment.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.332
How do we disarm them?

30:12.375 --> 30:14.203
It's way too late for
individual disarming.

30:14.247 --> 30:16.205
This thing is rigged
like bridge demolition.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.338
Okay, you need to find
the central trigger mechanism

30:18.381 --> 30:20.035

at the source.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.950
Oh, look. Does this look
like the same one?

30:21.994 --> 30:23.734
Yeah, that's it.
What's it for?

30:23.778 --> 30:25.998
It looks like it's only for
one panel on the whole train.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.772
Why is
the Manhattan Bridge empty?

31:01.816 --> 31:03.949
What?
The B line train runs

31:03.992 --> 31:05.733
over the Manhattan Bridge,
and the bridge is empty

31:05.776 --> 31:07.343
except for police cars.

31:07.387 --> 31:08.954
That doesn't make sense.

31:08.997 --> 31:11.608
Oh my, God. The NYPD
evacuated the bridge.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.132
They're gonna derail
the train over the river.

31:13.175 --> 31:15.482
Why would they do that?To minimize casualties.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.919
100 lives versus
1,000 in Midtown.

31:17.963 --> 31:20.269

31:20.313 --> 31:22.489
are you sure we can
defuse these bombs?

31:22.532 --> 31:24.404
We can do this.
We just need

31:24.447 --> 31:26.145
a few more minutes.Okay, okay.

31:26.188 --> 31:27.929
Who's gonna get me
the NYPD on the phone?

31:27.973 --> 31:30.149
Uh, Jane, are you still
on the subway roof?

31:33.195 --> 31:34.370
Let's just focus
on stopping the bomb.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.633
So it looks like
it's GPS triggered

31:36.677 --> 31:39.419
and programmed to blow once
it reaches the Metzinger Tower.

31:39.462 --> 31:41.856
But the good news is
we can reprogram it.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.379
I'm clinging to the top
of a speeding train.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.164
Just tell me what to do. Yep, yep.

31:45.207 --> 31:47.079
I'm writing you
a new line of code

31:47.122 --> 31:49.081
that will trick the GPS
to reset the bomb

31:49.124 --> 31:51.953
to blow once it reaches India
which, of course, it never will.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.086
I-I can't hear
a word you're saying.

31:54.129 --> 31:55.522
Sergeant Justin Cogley,
come in.

this is Rich Dotcom

31:57.045 --> 31:59.178
Okay, Jane.
I just sent you the code.

31:59.221 --> 32:01.006
Patterson, this is-- A lot of typing,
I know.

32:01.049 --> 32:02.964

no typos, no pressure.

32:05.836 --> 32:08.187
Okay, copy that.
I got Sergeant Justin
Cogley on his radio.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.015
He needs Weitz's
FBI authorization

32:10.058 --> 32:13.105
to let the train through.Why would I authorize that?

32:13.148 --> 32:16.238
Because Jane is close
to disarming this bomb,

32:16.282 --> 32:17.587
and if we claim jurisdiction,

32:17.631 --> 32:19.589
the NYPD won't derail
the train.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.113
I understand the circumstance.
What I'm saying is,

32:21.156 --> 32:22.810
you are
emotionally compromised

32:22.853 --> 32:24.420
because your teammates
are on board the train.

32:24.464 --> 32:25.987
They're your teammates too,
and there's still

32:26.031 --> 32:27.684
a scenario here
where no one dies.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.904
We are running out of time.We're not out of time yet.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.819
We can do this,
I know it.

32:33.429 --> 32:35.431
I cannot prioritize
my own agents' lives

32:35.475 --> 32:36.867
on a whim.

32:36.911 --> 32:37.999
There are people
I have to answer to.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.001
Okay, so that's
what this is about?

32:40.045 --> 32:42.134
You wanna save face more than
you wanna save these people?

32:42.177 --> 32:45.050
You think I don't care
if people live or die?

32:45.093 --> 32:46.790
This is protocol.

32:46.834 --> 32:49.228
So if it all goes bad now,
it's on the NYPD.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.186
But if you override the call

32:51.230 --> 32:52.709
and the train blows up
its target,

32:52.753 --> 32:54.189
you get blamed?

32:54.233 --> 32:56.278
How dare you make me out
to be the bad guy.

32:56.322 --> 32:59.194
You're not the bad guy,
you're the director.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.500
This is on you,

33:00.543 --> 33:02.502

to do it alone.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.071
I know I'm asking for a lot,

33:06.114 --> 33:07.942
that the casualty numbers
don't tip in my favor.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.074
But you're new here,

33:09.117 --> 33:10.205

Everything but
the last letter.

M

Uh, no, it's N

Next time,
Reade goes on the roof,

34:50.262 --> 34:51.785

No, none taken.

35:45.099 --> 35:47.667
Since taking over HCI Global,

35:47.710 --> 35:50.235
I've become increasingly aware
of the poor choices

35:50.278 --> 35:52.585
made by my predecessor
Hank Crawford.

35:52.628 --> 35:55.065
To that end, I met today
with the FBI

35:55.109 --> 35:57.242
to root out some of those
corrupt elements.

35:57.285 --> 35:59.983
And I think that the evidence
we gave proved

36:00.027 --> 36:03.422
instrumental in stopping today's domestic terror attack.

36:04.727 --> 36:07.252
Everybody's gonna eat that up.

36:07.295 --> 36:08.818
Now we know why
she came in today.

36:08.862 --> 36:11.212
It's kind of a baller move,
if I'm being honest.

36:11.256 --> 36:12.257
Yeah, but what's
her endgame, though?

36:12.300 --> 36:13.649
Why even help us at all?

36:13.693 --> 36:15.390
Because she likes
playing us.
