01:17.500 --> 01:19.769
It's okay. Mommy's here, okay?

01:24.091 --> 01:26.677
I need you to be a big boy, okay?

01:33.724 --> 01:37.433
Get under the bed. Get under the bed.
Right now. Quick. Quick.

01:41.404 --> 01:43.313
Please, leave us alone!

01:57.915 --> 01:59.704
Where's Mom? Where's...

02:02.651 --> 02:04.244
Go, Michael, go!

02:08.859 --> 02:09.874
No!

02:19.515 --> 02:20.791
Michael.

02:21.915 --> 02:23.541
Michael, run!

05:59.387 --> 06:01.875
You're going to run down the battery.

06:04.252 --> 06:06.969
Like you could get a signal
around here anyway.

06:07.035 --> 06:11.442
Luckily, people out here remember you can
have conversations without those things.

06:13.947 --> 06:15.857
It's okay, buddy.

06:15.931 --> 06:18.582
Be careful not to unbuckle his seatbelt.

06:18.715 --> 06:19.893
I'm not.

06:25.724 --> 06:28.626
We're here. How about that?

07:04.763 --> 07:06.356
No going back now.

07:06.779 --> 07:09.430
We couldn't afford it even if we wanted to.

07:09.499 --> 07:13.143
I know it's a bit run-down,
but wait till you see the inside.

07:14.811 --> 07:17.113
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Denise, check out the water pump.

07:17.179 --> 07:19.797
You want to come see your new back yard?

07:20.763 --> 07:22.224
Yeah? It's big.

08:25.499 --> 08:28.117
- Still works.
- Yeah, I'm impressed.

08:33.787 --> 08:34.736
I know you're worried.

08:34.811 --> 08:39.416
But a couple of days and I'll have everything
here running like new. I promise.

08:39.995 --> 08:41.270
Even that?

08:44.763 --> 08:46.651
All right. Maybe a week.

08:48.699 --> 08:50.706
Still think we can do this?

08:51.579 --> 08:54.361
Climate's right. The soil reports are great.

08:55.131 --> 08:56.920
Listen, I know I couldn't
make this work in the city.

08:56.987 --> 08:59.671
But this is something I know.

09:59.451 --> 10:00.629
Jess.

10:02.171 --> 10:04.560
Jess, come help with these bags.

10:07.867 --> 10:10.071
What do you think of the house?

10:11.515 --> 10:12.562
Neat.

10:13.787 --> 10:16.984
Help us unload. If we want anything to
sleep on tonight, we got to get moving.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.098
Okay.

10:18.683 --> 10:19.828
Neat.

11:26.362 --> 11:28.566
I think she's going to be okay.

11:33.723 --> 11:37.269
Well, at least she's talking to us.
I guess that's a start.

11:37.979 --> 11:39.027
Yeah.

11:42.715 --> 11:44.919
I love it out here, you know.

11:55.483 --> 11:57.850
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:58.907 --> 12:00.368
How's it going?

12:03.867 --> 12:05.689
It's so quiet out here.

12:06.363 --> 12:09.080
Yeah. It takes some getting used to, huh?

12:20.923 --> 12:24.501
You know, bringing you out here
wasn't a punishment, Jessica.

12:24.570 --> 12:26.872
It's an adjustment for everybody.

12:28.347 --> 12:31.282
And the only way
we're going to make this work

12:31.355 --> 12:33.362
is if we give it a chance.

12:37.211 --> 12:39.666
"I'll take that as a good point, Dad.

12:39.739 --> 12:42.160
"You're right. You're always right."

12:51.194 --> 12:52.503
Good night.

12:55.194 --> 12:56.656
Get some sleep.

13:10.427 --> 13:12.150
Don't give up, honey!

13:14.331 --> 13:16.241
Don't worry. I'll get it.

13:17.626 --> 13:18.804
Come on.

13:19.707 --> 13:20.884
Come on.

13:21.435 --> 13:22.547
Come on.

13:22.619 --> 13:25.041
Come on. That's right. Come on.

13:27.834 --> 13:30.256
He did it! High-five. High-five.

13:34.683 --> 13:35.730
He did it!

14:09.114 --> 14:10.456
Roy Solomon?

14:11.738 --> 14:13.364
Colby Price. Belton Savings.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.856
Oh, hey. Good to meet you.

14:16.794 --> 14:20.056
So you said your father grew sunflowers, too.

14:20.634 --> 14:23.090
Yeah, over in Turek County.

14:24.570 --> 14:26.359
I grew up not too far from here.

14:26.427 --> 14:27.539
Right.

14:28.539 --> 14:30.994
Look, I know you're all moved in,

14:31.067 --> 14:35.377
but an opportunity came up at the bank
that I thought you might be interested in.

14:35.451 --> 14:38.320
This place sat gathering dust for years
until you came along and bought it,

14:38.395 --> 14:40.762
and now, as it happens,

14:40.827 --> 14:44.023
another party's expressed
interest in the farm.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.769
The good news is, they're willing
to pay what you paid and...

14:46.849 --> 14:48.840
put another 15% on top of that.

14:52.539 --> 14:54.394
We just got here.

14:54.459 --> 14:55.735
And frankly,

14:56.443 --> 14:59.672
my family's looking
for a little stability right now.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.573
Well, this will give you the details.

15:04.442 --> 15:07.061
Give me a call if you want to discuss it.

15:10.267 --> 15:11.543
Thanks, I will.

15:15.835 --> 15:17.722
Hey, Benny.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.096
I'm coming.

15:33.786 --> 15:35.063
You ready?

15:41.274 --> 15:42.616
Oh, great.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.052
Ben?

16:49.115 --> 16:50.130
Ben?

17:02.139 --> 17:04.179
Hey, sport.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.193
I thought you were asleep.

17:06.939 --> 17:09.175
How'd you get out of bed, sport?

17:10.617 --> 17:12.560
I thought you were...

17:21.146 --> 17:23.285
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

17:23.897 --> 17:24.847
Okay.

17:27.002 --> 17:30.167
All right, Ben.
Now you try to get some sleep now, okay?

17:30.778 --> 17:34.324
Lay down. Go to sleep. Good boy.

17:35.002 --> 17:36.529
Daddy loves you.

17:59.514 --> 18:00.561
What?

18:21.946 --> 18:23.604
What are you doing?

18:23.834 --> 18:26.518
- Going to town.
- I don't think so, Jess.

18:27.387 --> 18:28.947
Give me the keys.

18:29.018 --> 18:31.255
I just had them, like, two seconds ago.

18:33.147 --> 18:35.285
Thanks, Jess. You ready to go?

18:36.219 --> 18:37.266
Jess?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.110
What's up with that?

18:42.299 --> 18:44.121
It was me, not her.

18:44.186 --> 18:46.488
I thought she was taking the car.

18:48.122 --> 18:50.326
Don't beat yourself up over it.

18:52.026 --> 18:55.921
By the way, your son managed
to climb out of his crib last night.

18:55.994 --> 18:57.303
That's new.

18:57.978 --> 18:59.025
Yeah.

19:00.379 --> 19:02.997
So are the things I'm gonna do to you

19:04.346 --> 19:06.932
when I come in from the fields tonight.

19:07.738 --> 19:09.527
- New things, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.847
I've been reading the farmer-sutra.

19:14.267 --> 19:15.095
See you.

19:34.843 --> 19:39.480
- There you go. You have a good day now.
- Thanks, Ed.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.455
Well, you're the new folks in town, right?

19:41.530 --> 19:43.319
Yeah, Roy Solomon.

19:43.386 --> 19:45.688
- So what do you plant?
- Sunflowers.

19:45.755 --> 19:48.340
All right. Let me help you get started.

19:49.562 --> 19:51.799
Hey, mind if I go look around?

19:56.442 --> 19:57.653
Okay.

19:57.723 --> 20:00.144
Hey, don't go too far.

21:49.402 --> 21:50.711
Hey, buddy.

21:52.538 --> 21:55.058
Hey, what're you looking at?

22:00.378 --> 22:02.517
You didn't get to finish your cereal.

22:03.930 --> 22:07.607
And Daddy said you got out of the crib
last night all by yourself.

22:08.091 --> 22:10.327
Did you do that all by yourself?

22:13.658 --> 22:15.513
Nice!

22:17.050 --> 22:18.260
Pass it up.

22:18.682 --> 22:19.631
Got it.

22:19.738 --> 22:20.687
You're all over him.

22:22.106 --> 22:23.535
- Get up! Get up!
- Take it!

22:24.634 --> 22:26.903
- Come on, Bobby. What was that?
- Come on.

22:27.354 --> 22:28.696
Little help?

22:30.330 --> 22:31.475
Thanks.

22:37.402 --> 22:39.823
- It's all in the wrists.
- Right.

22:39.898 --> 22:41.305
I'm Bobby.

22:41.370 --> 22:42.548
Jess.

22:42.651 --> 22:46.131
Welcome to North Dakota, Jess.
You're from Chicago, right?

22:46.746 --> 22:49.331
Yeah. How'd you know that?

22:50.075 --> 22:54.330
Small town. Everybody knows everything.
You might want to remember that.

22:55.706 --> 22:58.521
So what do you guys do for fun out here?

22:59.898 --> 23:01.621
You're looking at it.

23:02.906 --> 23:04.019
Sweet.

23:05.402 --> 23:08.718
Half now and half at harvest.
That's the best I can do.

23:12.378 --> 23:13.720
I appreciate it.

23:13.786 --> 23:18.161
And if you're looking for labor,
it's gotten cheap with all the unemployment.

23:18.426 --> 23:23.543
I can't afford much now,
but I'll keep it in mind. Thanks, Ed.

23:26.426 --> 23:28.281
You're kicking my ass.

23:29.210 --> 23:31.349
Yeah, it's all in the wrists.

23:31.418 --> 23:34.135
Come on, you played in Chicago, right?

23:34.202 --> 23:36.885
Well, I used to. I played in junior high.

23:37.979 --> 23:39.288
Yeah? What happened?

23:39.354 --> 23:43.445
I don't know.
I guess I just got into other things.

23:44.218 --> 23:46.901
Well, the girls' team here is for shit.

23:57.370 --> 23:59.826
Yeah, boys' is too, if you're on it.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.252
Nice one, bro.

24:07.386 --> 24:12.404
Hey, you know, if you ever get bored
of doing nothing out at the farm,

24:14.874 --> 24:18.038
I could always swing by and pick you up,

24:18.106 --> 24:22.230
and we could go do nothing someplace else.

24:24.411 --> 24:25.839
Yeah, maybe.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.627
Hey, I got to go.

24:33.434 --> 24:36.216
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

24:40.090 --> 24:41.650
Nice to meet you.

24:45.946 --> 24:47.833
Hey, who was that kid?

24:49.242 --> 24:50.671
Just some guy.

24:52.538 --> 24:54.099
From around here?

24:55.290 --> 24:57.777
No. He commutes to shoot hoops.

24:58.746 --> 25:01.197
- You get his number?
- Dad.

25:01.270 --> 25:02.714
If you want to go back,
if you're too embarrassed,

25:02.782 --> 25:05.016
- I'll get his number for you.
- Dad.

25:12.474 --> 25:16.947
I think you and your mom would have
a lot to talk about if you give it a try.

25:21.818 --> 25:24.152
We're all in this together, Jess.

25:40.922 --> 25:43.410
So I'll go see if Mom needs anything.

25:43.898 --> 25:45.621
Okay. Sure.

25:50.778 --> 25:52.566
How was town?

25:52.634 --> 25:53.746
Small.

25:55.930 --> 25:59.312
Hey, Jess, I'm really sorry about earlier.

26:01.498 --> 26:02.774
It's okay.

26:05.082 --> 26:07.253
Need me to help you with anything?

26:07.322 --> 26:10.104
I'd love it if you could carry down
some of those boxes in the hallway.

26:10.170 --> 26:12.575
Sure. Where do you want them?

26:14.105 --> 26:16.145
Just put them in the cellar.

26:18.682 --> 26:19.827
Thanks.

26:27.834 --> 26:30.223
Oh, God. You got to stop that.

26:30.298 --> 26:32.338
Sorry if I surprised you.

26:32.410 --> 26:33.839
What do you want?

26:33.914 --> 26:36.248
I wondered if you'd had a chance
to look at that purchase offer yet.

26:36.314 --> 26:38.802
We're gonna make a go of it.

26:38.874 --> 26:40.303
We're staying.

26:41.146 --> 26:44.015
Now, if you don't mind, I've got work to do.

26:45.850 --> 26:47.573
Of course.

26:48.154 --> 26:51.056
Always lots of work to do around a farm.

26:51.130 --> 26:52.308
Bye now.

28:02.233 --> 28:03.444
Damn it!

28:07.993 --> 28:09.520
Get out of here!

28:12.250 --> 28:13.297
Shit.

30:11.706 --> 30:12.982
Oh, my God.

30:38.234 --> 30:41.016
About the only thing that keeps them away.

30:41.082 --> 30:42.838
They always like that?

30:42.905 --> 30:45.393
No. Hell, they just want your seeds.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.017
- Roy Solomon.
- John Burwell.

30:48.090 --> 30:51.090
Good to meet you.
Lucky you came by when you did.

30:51.162 --> 30:54.161
- You live around here?
- No, I was just heading into town.

30:54.233 --> 30:56.056
Got to go where the work is.

30:56.122 --> 30:57.780
What do you do?

30:57.850 --> 31:00.436
A little bit of everything. Why, you...

31:02.298 --> 31:04.786
You need some help around here?

31:04.858 --> 31:07.727
What was that noise? What's going on?

31:07.802 --> 31:10.104
Everything's all right.

31:10.170 --> 31:13.465
This is John Burwell,
part-time crow exterminator.

31:13.529 --> 31:16.497
The crows were going nuts out here.
If John hadn't come along when he did,

31:16.569 --> 31:18.457
I might have gotten pecked to death.

31:18.522 --> 31:20.497
Well, it's a good thing he did then.

31:20.570 --> 31:22.980
I could sure use somebody
to help me in the fields, but...

31:23.060 --> 31:24.961
I really can't pay you till harvest.

31:25.370 --> 31:29.625
We could provide meals and put you up
in the workers' quarters till then.

31:30.874 --> 31:32.183
Sunflowers, huh?

31:32.985 --> 31:34.512
All you can eat.

31:35.450 --> 31:37.043
That sounds good to me.

31:37.978 --> 31:41.142
Well, I was making some lunch.
Would you like to join us?

31:41.210 --> 31:43.447
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Okay.

31:48.089 --> 31:50.773
Do you mind keeping that outside?

31:50.842 --> 31:52.249
Sorry.

32:00.473 --> 32:02.578
Got any family out here, John?

32:03.418 --> 32:05.076
No, ma'am. Just me.

32:09.721 --> 32:11.761
Think it's going to be a good harvest?

32:11.833 --> 32:16.306
Well, it's been a while since
that land's been planted, so, yeah.

32:17.690 --> 32:19.795
That's what I like to hear.

32:19.865 --> 32:21.010
Cheers.

32:23.578 --> 32:26.545
Hey, Jess. Do you mind helping me with these?

32:26.618 --> 32:27.665
Yeah.

32:28.986 --> 32:30.131
Thanks.

32:34.554 --> 32:35.983
You want this?

32:38.938 --> 32:40.399
He won't stop.

32:40.474 --> 32:42.613
But it must mean he likes you.

32:44.954 --> 32:47.026
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

33:35.001 --> 33:36.856
What are you looking for?

33:36.921 --> 33:38.099
Nothing.

33:38.682 --> 33:39.697
Roy?

33:40.665 --> 33:42.072
What's wrong?

33:42.970 --> 33:44.464
Oh, my God!

33:44.538 --> 33:46.065
Are you okay?

33:46.137 --> 33:48.243
- What happened?
- It's no big deal.

33:48.314 --> 33:50.419
I cut my hand on the tractor.

33:51.033 --> 33:52.822
Oh, honey, you're gonna need stitches.

33:52.889 --> 33:54.231
No, I just need a bandage.

33:54.298 --> 33:55.727
No, we got to get you to the hospital.

33:55.802 --> 33:57.525
Well, I can take him.

33:58.201 --> 34:00.787
Not with a suspended license, you can't.

34:00.889 --> 34:03.311
All right. I'm going to get Ben's bag.
Jess, you get in the car.

34:03.386 --> 34:05.426
Ben can stay here with Jess.

34:06.489 --> 34:08.213
Roy, I don't think it's a good idea.

34:08.282 --> 34:10.737
Just grab the keys and let's go.
Jess and Ben will be fine.

34:10.810 --> 34:13.527
John's right outside if they need anything.

34:29.976 --> 34:31.254
Holy shit.

34:35.705 --> 34:37.047
Your dad gonna be all right?

34:37.112 --> 34:39.601
Yeah. He probably just needs some stitches.

34:41.114 --> 34:44.245
Hey, what you got there? Farmer?

34:45.049 --> 34:48.759
You gonna be a farmer when you grow up,
like your daddy, huh?

34:48.824 --> 34:51.824
- Let me know if you need anything, okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

34:55.737 --> 34:57.647
What's up with the crows?

35:08.154 --> 35:11.187
All right, Ben. Tonight we have

35:12.217 --> 35:14.967
filet mignon, veal parmesan,

35:15.034 --> 35:18.743
baked Alaska, chicken cacciatore,

35:18.810 --> 35:20.915
and mac and cheese.

35:30.969 --> 35:32.693
Stay here, Ben, okay?

35:38.297 --> 35:39.312
Hey.

35:41.017 --> 35:42.064
John.

35:44.442 --> 35:45.783
Is that you?

35:55.098 --> 35:56.624
Hey, who is...

36:28.505 --> 36:30.293
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

36:30.362 --> 36:33.296
I think there's something in my house!

36:33.369 --> 36:36.217
<i>I need you to get everybody
out of the house as quickly as possible.</i>

36:36.282 --> 36:39.446
<i>We'll send a car immediately.
Ma'am, are you alone?</i>

36:39.514 --> 36:41.040
No, I'm with... I'm with...

36:41.113 --> 36:42.128
Ben!

36:53.881 --> 36:54.896
Ben!

37:11.161 --> 37:12.176
Ben?

37:21.658 --> 37:23.480
Ben, what are you...

37:25.242 --> 37:26.289
Ben!

37:44.890 --> 37:46.580
Let me go!

38:04.729 --> 38:06.223
What's wrong?

38:06.585 --> 38:09.487
Help us! Take him. Take him.

38:09.561 --> 38:11.121
What's the matter?

38:13.242 --> 38:16.242
What is it? Jess. What's the matter?

38:24.889 --> 38:27.093
Oh, Roy, I hope they're okay.

38:36.345 --> 38:39.280
- What happened?
- Everything's all right, ma'am.

38:40.826 --> 38:42.200
Oh, God.

38:47.161 --> 38:50.456
I already checked all the rooms.
There's nobody here.

38:50.521 --> 38:52.660
But she described a lot of damage.

38:53.914 --> 38:58.485
As of now, we're going to classify this
as a false alarm, not a deliberate hoax.

39:01.498 --> 39:02.774
Thank you.

39:07.833 --> 39:08.782
What did John say?

39:08.857 --> 39:11.574
Well, he said it was easy to understand
someone getting scared

39:11.641 --> 39:13.943
their first night alone out here.

39:16.281 --> 39:18.550
But that he didn't see
anything unusual in the house.

39:18.617 --> 39:22.960
Mom, please believe me. I'm not
making this up. I'm telling the truth.

39:23.033 --> 39:24.440
Jess, please.

39:25.977 --> 39:27.254
Just stop.

39:32.314 --> 39:33.328
Dad...

39:35.769 --> 39:38.551
Dad, I'm really scared. Can we just go home?

39:39.385 --> 39:42.582
Jessica, this is home.

39:43.673 --> 39:45.778
You need to get used to that.

39:47.897 --> 39:51.028
But I thought we agreed
that you were going to try.

39:54.042 --> 39:55.830
What happened to that?

40:27.961 --> 40:30.001
Hi. Shut the door.

40:34.169 --> 40:37.136
Maybe we shouldn't have
left Ben alone with her.

40:37.817 --> 40:41.712
Did you see her face? She seemed so scared.

40:44.570 --> 40:47.090
I'm really worried about her.

40:47.161 --> 40:50.325
She's just having
a hard time adjusting, that's all.

40:51.705 --> 40:54.193
Being out here will be great for her.

40:55.897 --> 40:57.304
I don't know.

40:58.553 --> 41:02.198
- Maybe we're in over our heads here, Roy.
- We'll get through this.

41:02.265 --> 41:04.566
Just give her some time. She'll be fine.

41:14.009 --> 41:16.016
You saw it too, didn't you?

41:19.897 --> 41:22.515
Come on. I know you did. You had to have.

41:23.449 --> 41:25.424
Just tell me.

41:28.953 --> 41:31.735
I wish you could just tell them what you saw.

41:32.921 --> 41:35.987
Come on, Ben.
When are you going to start talking?

41:43.225 --> 41:46.193
I promise I'll never let
anything happen to you.

41:47.769 --> 41:49.046
I promise.

42:11.705 --> 42:14.039
You heard that, too, didn't you?

42:15.385 --> 42:16.945
Can you see them?

42:25.305 --> 42:27.094
Where are they, Ben?

46:13.433 --> 46:14.895
Son of a bitch!

46:21.657 --> 46:23.631
Hey, you didn't hear that.

46:23.704 --> 46:26.322
- Dad said you needed this.
- Yeah, thanks.

46:28.249 --> 46:31.894
Why did you tell my parents
you didn't see anything last night?

46:32.537 --> 46:34.359
Well, because I didn't.

46:36.696 --> 46:39.282
I mean, look, I know you were scared.

46:40.121 --> 46:45.391
And I know that people,
even your parents, sometimes,

46:45.465 --> 46:48.498
- they don't know how to listen.
- Especially my parents.

46:48.568 --> 46:52.791
They got pressures that you
can't even begin to understand.

46:56.729 --> 46:59.314
You sure you saw something up there?

46:59.384 --> 47:02.450
I saw it. It was real.

47:03.832 --> 47:06.451
Maybe you've just got a lot on your mind.

47:18.969 --> 47:20.725
Hey, Jess.

47:20.793 --> 47:22.932
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

47:25.017 --> 47:27.351
You don't look so good. What's up?

47:29.369 --> 47:31.758
Did you know the family
that used to live in my house?

47:31.833 --> 47:34.134
Not really.
It was the Rollins that lived there.

47:34.200 --> 47:35.346
What happened to them?

47:35.417 --> 47:38.613
They just up and left
about five, six years ago.

47:38.681 --> 47:42.227
There were some bad harvests.
Lot of people didn't make it.

47:44.377 --> 47:45.489
Hey...

47:47.065 --> 47:51.953
Did you ever hear of anything
about my house being, like, haunted?

47:56.313 --> 47:57.590
Seriously.

47:57.688 --> 48:01.103
Just, like, stupid stories.
It's been abandoned for a long time. So...

48:01.176 --> 48:03.697
- What kind of stories?
- Nothing really.

48:04.793 --> 48:09.168
When we were kids, we used to dare
each other to go down into the cellar.

48:10.233 --> 48:12.436
Why? Did you ever see anything?

48:13.816 --> 48:15.126
No. Not me.

48:17.273 --> 48:19.160
I never went down there.

51:15.960 --> 51:17.521
What's happening to me?

51:40.249 --> 51:41.656
Are you okay?

51:43.992 --> 51:46.032
I saw something again today.

51:47.769 --> 51:51.085
It's a girl.
She was in the cellar. Something...

51:52.856 --> 51:54.961
Something happened to her.

51:58.233 --> 52:00.950
She was trying to get away from something.

52:01.561 --> 52:03.895
- Get away from what?
- I don't know.

52:04.537 --> 52:06.097
But she was...

52:06.169 --> 52:09.365
She looked just scared to death.

52:16.248 --> 52:18.037
Have you told your folks about this?

52:18.104 --> 52:20.438
You know my parents already think I'm nuts.

52:23.449 --> 52:25.336
Do you think it's crazy?

52:26.937 --> 52:28.530
People's spirits

52:29.657 --> 52:32.046
hanging around after they're dead?

52:34.009 --> 52:35.219
No.

52:36.281 --> 52:39.794
There's something about the land out here.

52:39.865 --> 52:43.476
It gets ahold of people.
It doesn't want to let them go.

52:51.416 --> 52:54.286
What about you?
Don't you get lonely out here?

52:55.384 --> 52:57.872
Don't you miss having a family of your own?

52:57.945 --> 53:00.530
Nah, you guys keep me plenty busy.

53:08.313 --> 53:11.280
Thank you. For listening.

53:13.528 --> 53:14.706
Anytime.

53:31.736 --> 53:34.900
- Almost ready.
- Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

53:39.064 --> 53:41.039
I really like being here, Roy.

53:41.112 --> 53:44.178
You guys make me feel like family.
I'm grateful.

53:44.248 --> 53:46.135
Lucky to have you, John.

53:46.840 --> 53:50.997
Let's see how good the harvest is,
and maybe I can afford to keep you on.

53:51.064 --> 53:54.446
Don't worry about me.
You just take care of your family.

55:19.032 --> 55:20.657
<i>Help me.</i>

55:42.360 --> 55:43.473
Hello?

55:55.032 --> 55:56.942
What do you want from me?

56:49.336 --> 56:50.351
Hey.

56:55.864 --> 56:57.074
You okay?

57:02.584 --> 57:04.111
Can you hear me?

57:14.681 --> 57:16.087
What's wrong?

57:49.048 --> 57:50.225
Is she okay?

57:50.296 --> 57:52.947
The lacerations are superficial.
So she'll be just fine.

57:53.016 --> 57:54.543
Oh, thank God.

57:55.448 --> 57:57.009
Is there any reason...

57:57.080 --> 58:00.014
Has there been any trouble
in the family recently

58:00.088 --> 58:03.765
that would make her want to hurt
or draw attention to herself?

58:09.816 --> 58:12.052
We just moved here from Chicago.

58:12.888 --> 58:15.310
And back there,

58:15.384 --> 58:18.929
Jess got into some trouble.

58:20.984 --> 58:23.122
She's kind of struggled a bit.

58:23.480 --> 58:27.506
We've been dealing
with a lot of emotional issues.

58:40.568 --> 58:42.478
Jessica? Your mom's here.

58:43.704 --> 58:44.719
Hey.

58:56.568 --> 58:59.088
Dad, we need to leave the house now,

58:59.160 --> 59:01.265
before anything else happens.

59:03.224 --> 59:04.238
Dad.

59:05.976 --> 59:07.470
Dad, I'm really scared.

59:07.544 --> 59:11.122
Have you forgotten how hard it was
the last couple of years?

59:11.768 --> 59:14.485
Me out of work, Ben's hospital bills.

59:14.552 --> 59:17.421
We went through every dime
your mother and I managed to save.

59:17.496 --> 59:21.806
Twenty years.
Twenty years of savings gone in two years.

59:23.864 --> 59:27.442
We have everything riding
on this harvest, Jess. Everything.

59:29.016 --> 59:31.634
We're only a couple of days away. Please.

59:35.672 --> 59:38.257
- Mom, these things attacked me.
- Enough!

59:46.584 --> 59:50.675
God. The doctor said
your cuts look self-inflicted.

59:50.744 --> 59:53.330
That's what he said. That you did this!

59:55.832 --> 59:58.647
You actually think
that I would do this to myself?

01:00:01.656 --> 01:00:03.566
Why won't you believe me?

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.840
How can we, Jess?

01:00:08.568 --> 01:00:09.746
Tell me!

01:00:11.448 --> 01:00:14.033
I mean, we thought
you put this all behind you.

01:00:22.584 --> 01:00:25.202
Why do you keep blaming everything on me?

01:00:26.072 --> 01:00:27.894
You never listen to me.

01:00:29.111 --> 01:00:33.040
And what? We're supposed to pretend
like we're some big happy family again?

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:34.990
I can't do that.

01:00:37.751 --> 01:00:38.799
Jess!

01:00:42.104 --> 01:00:43.413
Let her go.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.677
Maybe coming here was a mistake.

01:01:19.448 --> 01:01:21.455
Don't second-guess yourself, Roy.

01:01:21.528 --> 01:01:25.041
Why not? Everybody else around here does.

01:01:25.112 --> 01:01:27.054
Don't attack me over this.

01:01:28.536 --> 01:01:30.194
I should have sold.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.709
- Damn it.
- What?

01:01:41.208 --> 01:01:44.885
Right after we got here,
there was another offer on the place.

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:50.035
We would have made our money back,
plus another 15%.

01:01:56.727 --> 01:01:59.477
And you didn't even mention this to me?

01:01:59.544 --> 01:02:02.927
How could I? You would have
taken the offer on the spot.

01:02:03.704 --> 01:02:06.737
So you make this decision
without even telling me?

01:02:06.808 --> 01:02:10.452
I held this family together for two years
while you were looking for a job.

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:15.254
And then I come all the way out here
when you decided this was the answer.

01:02:15.319 --> 01:02:18.996
And now we had another option
and you didn't even tell me about it?

01:02:19.063 --> 01:02:21.202
You held this family together?

01:02:21.976 --> 01:02:25.359
Is that why you and Jess can't even be in
the same room for more than five minutes?

01:02:25.432 --> 01:02:27.471
No wonder the girl's a mess.

01:02:31.128 --> 01:02:34.423
Damn, Denise. Denise, I'm sorry.

01:02:37.464 --> 01:02:38.641
Damn it.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.847
Damn.

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:03.340
Everything okay, Roy?

01:03:03.416 --> 01:03:06.733
No matter what I do,
I can't keep this family together.

01:03:26.615 --> 01:03:28.274
Hey. You all right?

01:03:29.336 --> 01:03:30.994
Do you want a ride?

01:03:34.328 --> 01:03:36.215
So where are we going?

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.352
Feed store.

01:03:38.424 --> 01:03:39.471
Why?

01:03:43.672 --> 01:03:45.527
Bobby, I'm gonna tell you something.

01:03:45.592 --> 01:03:49.367
And I need you to believe me,
because nobody else does.

01:03:49.432 --> 01:03:50.447
Okay.

01:03:50.519 --> 01:03:52.723
I don't think the Rollins just up and left.

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:55.093
What are you talking about, Jess?

01:03:55.511 --> 01:03:57.519
I think something really terrible
happened to them.

01:03:57.591 --> 01:04:00.079
I think they're dead. I've seen them.

01:04:01.336 --> 01:04:02.994
You've seen ghosts?

01:04:09.848 --> 01:04:13.623
- Have you talked to your parents?
- I've tried but they won't listen to me.

01:04:13.688 --> 01:04:14.703
Why?

01:04:16.183 --> 01:04:18.966
Back in Chicago, I messed up.

01:04:23.544 --> 01:04:27.919
Like, six months ago, my mom was
picking up my dad from the airport.

01:04:27.992 --> 01:04:31.669
And his flight was late,
so she called to see if I could

01:04:31.736 --> 01:04:35.282
pick up my little brother
from the babysitter's house.

01:04:35.352 --> 01:04:40.174
And I should have told her
that I'd been drinking with my friends but...

01:04:40.248 --> 01:04:42.768
I mean, it wasn't like
I was wasted or anything,

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.182
and I thought I was okay to drive.

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:49.583
But we got in a wreck,
and Ben had to go to the hospital.

01:04:51.224 --> 01:04:53.460
And he hasn't talked since then.

01:04:55.895 --> 01:04:59.605
I mean, they just haven't let it go yet.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:04.533
Everybody makes mistakes, Jess.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.567
Yeah.

01:05:12.056 --> 01:05:14.260
Your sister's going to be okay.

01:05:14.776 --> 01:05:16.183
Right, Benny?

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.858
Say, "Right, Mama."

01:05:31.992 --> 01:05:34.130
What are you pointing at, Ben?

01:05:36.311 --> 01:05:38.199
What do you see?

01:05:39.799 --> 01:05:41.621
What does it look like?

01:06:14.488 --> 01:06:15.917
What the hell?

01:06:59.608 --> 01:07:02.390
Okay, honey. Lie down for your nap, sweetie.

01:07:03.448 --> 01:07:05.520
You okay? All right.

01:08:04.663 --> 01:08:07.827
The woman in this watch,
I remember seeing her here.

01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:11.600
There!

01:08:14.263 --> 01:08:15.572
That's her.

01:08:20.535 --> 01:08:21.746
Oh, my God.

01:08:21.816 --> 01:08:23.953
- What is it?
- I got to get home.

01:08:28.023 --> 01:08:30.991
Ben, honey. We got to get out of here.

01:08:32.854 --> 01:08:34.765
Honey, come on.

01:09:16.983 --> 01:09:20.115
Mama will be right there.
Mama will be right there.

01:09:21.336 --> 01:09:23.921
All right. Stay right there. All right, okay.

01:09:23.991 --> 01:09:27.286
Mama will be right there.
You stay right there.

01:09:28.023 --> 01:09:29.616
Oh, my God, John.

01:09:30.455 --> 01:09:32.145
Where are you going?

01:09:33.911 --> 01:09:35.951
Where are you going, Mary?

01:09:37.751 --> 01:09:38.799
What?

01:09:41.527 --> 01:09:42.934
What is this?

01:09:45.175 --> 01:09:46.834
Are you leaving me?

01:09:47.639 --> 01:09:49.778
- I don't...
- Shut up!

01:09:49.911 --> 01:09:51.733
No, don't...

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.797
I've been working my ass off every day.

01:09:56.343 --> 01:09:58.962
- It's never good enough for you, is it?
- Oh, God.

01:10:00.695 --> 01:10:04.372
Did you really think
that I could ever let you leave me?

01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:14.001
Michael.

01:10:22.615 --> 01:10:25.136
Open this door! Open this door, Mary!

01:10:36.183 --> 01:10:37.198
Mom?

01:10:41.015 --> 01:10:42.030
Dad?

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.414
Mom?

01:11:05.591 --> 01:11:06.606
Mom?

01:11:08.087 --> 01:11:09.102
Ben?

01:11:44.407 --> 01:11:45.389
Go!

01:12:00.599 --> 01:12:02.160
Bobby, wait!

01:12:02.231 --> 01:12:03.441
- What?
- My brother.

01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:06.740
- He's not here. Let's go.
- Bobby, watch out!

01:12:15.959 --> 01:12:18.348
Open the door!

01:12:30.327 --> 01:12:31.341
Mom?

01:12:48.119 --> 01:12:49.134
Mom.

01:12:49.527 --> 01:12:50.737
Oh, Jess.

01:12:52.119 --> 01:12:54.258
I know what you were seeing.

01:12:54.327 --> 01:12:57.709
I've seen it, too.
I'm so sorry I didn't trust you.

01:13:04.823 --> 01:13:06.766
Mom, I've got to find a way out of here.

01:13:06.839 --> 01:13:08.181
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:13:11.671 --> 01:13:16.079
Mary. Do you think I would let you
walk out on this family?

01:13:19.799 --> 01:13:21.621
Open the door, Lindsay.

01:13:27.223 --> 01:13:28.848
Open the door!

01:14:02.487 --> 01:14:04.275
You're not leaving me.

01:15:09.815 --> 01:15:12.499
Be quiet, sweetheart. Be quiet.

01:15:23.959 --> 01:15:26.130
Bobby? Bobby!

01:15:31.959 --> 01:15:34.447
Where are they, Bobby? Where are they?

01:15:48.535 --> 01:15:49.681
Denise?

01:15:51.287 --> 01:15:53.807
- Dad?
- Jess.

01:15:53.879 --> 01:15:54.926
Dad!

01:15:58.199 --> 01:16:00.533
You've been a bad girl, Lindsay.

01:16:06.807 --> 01:16:08.880
No! Leave her alone!

01:16:13.367 --> 01:16:14.796
Come here!

01:16:16.791 --> 01:16:20.206
Why are you always trying
to run away from me, Lindsay?

01:16:22.263 --> 01:16:24.303
What's the matter with you?

01:16:25.143 --> 01:16:27.379
Don't you like your family?

01:16:30.903 --> 01:16:33.718
My family is going to stick together!

01:16:41.783 --> 01:16:43.823
We're not your family!

01:17:48.471 --> 01:17:49.616
Mom?

01:17:57.463 --> 01:17:58.478
Dad!

01:18:03.063 --> 01:18:04.241
I got you.

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:21.040
Hold on!

01:19:07.351 --> 01:19:09.042
Hey, honey, it's me.

01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:12.878
It's gonna be all right.

01:19:14.486 --> 01:19:17.421
Mrs. Solomon,
I have just a few more questions.

01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:34.291
You're gonna be okay.

01:19:56.982 --> 01:19:58.575
Excuse us, please.

01:19:59.031 --> 01:20:00.307
Let's get him in.

01:20:28.439 --> 01:20:30.544
Maybe now they can rest, Ben.

01:20:39.767 --> 01:20:41.655
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:41.719 --> 01:20:44.436
- You thirsty?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

01:20:50.295 --> 01:20:52.018
So, how's it going?

01:20:53.335 --> 01:20:54.764
Getting there.

01:20:56.406 --> 01:20:58.894
What's up there, dude? What's in the sky?

01:20:58.967 --> 01:21:01.585
- That. Birdie.
- What's that?

01:21:03.447 --> 01:21:07.538
- Is that a cloud?
- Crow. That's a crow.

01:21:12.599 --> 01:21:14.060
How about that?

01:21:15.305 --> 01:21:21.890
