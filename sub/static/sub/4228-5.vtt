01:44.605 --> 01:46.023
What's going on?

01:47.399 --> 01:48.526
I don't know.

01:50.236 --> 01:51.362
What's up?

01:51.403 --> 01:52.863
- It's Anne and Alexis.
- What about them?

01:53.030 --> 01:55.366
They're missing.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.418
Dr. Glass asked me
to analyze the DNA

02:06.502 --> 02:08.379
of 12 de-harnessed children.

02:08.462 --> 02:12.383
Eleven presented with
no abnormalities whatsoever.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.469
But one showed signs
of alien DNA,

02:15.553 --> 02:17.847
the strands intertwining
with human DNA

02:17.930 --> 02:20.474
like kudzu in
a Northwestern rainforest.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.393
It's a vine-like plant

02:22.476 --> 02:24.436
- in the genus pueraria...
- Doctor, please.

02:24.603 --> 02:25.729
The point.

02:27.606 --> 02:30.609
The baby... is not human.

02:36.407 --> 02:38.450
So... she's an alien?

02:38.534 --> 02:42.413
No, she's a hybrid,
a-an entirely new species.

02:42.538 --> 02:45.374
At least, that's
my preliminary analysis.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.792
After Dr. Glass left Dr. Kadar,

02:46.876 --> 02:48.919
she went back to her room,
drugged Lourdes,

02:48.961 --> 02:50.921
and, as far as we can tell,
she took Alexis,

02:50.963 --> 02:52.423
but we don't know where.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.425
We were having a glass of wine,

02:54.508 --> 02:58.429
and... the...
the next thing I knew,

02:58.512 --> 03:00.514
C... Colonel Weaver
was shaking me awake.

03:00.598 --> 03:03.517
So...
she just disappeared?

03:03.601 --> 03:05.394
Seems that way.

03:05.436 --> 03:07.396
And they're not
in Charleston anywhere?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.522
We've searched everywhere.

03:08.606 --> 03:10.524
Dr. Glass wouldn't just
run away.

03:11.442 --> 03:12.610
That's not like her.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.737
It's possible she was afraid

03:14.778 --> 03:16.447
what would happen if people
found out about the baby.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.490
I think she just did
what any mother would do.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.784
I agree... Anne is not
the type of person

03:20.868 --> 03:24.622
who goes around knocking people
out or... or drugging them.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.290
Colonel, if she's in the badlands...

03:26.332 --> 03:28.459
We're gonna need a search party.
Won't need more than 50,

03:28.542 --> 03:29.835
- maybe 100 volunteers.
- Colonel.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.503
Travel by horseback.
Cover more ground that way.

03:31.587 --> 03:32.630
Colonel Weaver!

03:33.464 --> 03:34.506
Ms. Peralta.

03:34.590 --> 03:36.467
A moment, please.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.681
(SIGHING)

03:42.765 --> 03:44.558
I need you to get
some perspective here.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.311
On what, Ms. Peralta?

03:47.394 --> 03:49.438
You know we can't afford
100 people for a search party.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.440
We can't afford 50 people
or 20 people.

03:51.482 --> 03:52.483
We can't afford anyone.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.485
We're talking about Anne Glass
and her newborn daughter,

03:54.526 --> 03:57.029
- Tom Mason's newborn daughter.
- I understand that.

03:58.447 --> 04:01.325
- I'm not sure you do.
- I most certainly do,

04:01.450 --> 04:04.411
but there are 5,000 other lives
that I have to consider.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.372
Now, if you want to go
look for her,

04:06.455 --> 04:09.375
and I assume you do,
you have my blessing.

04:10.376 --> 04:12.503
I can't conduct
an effective search by myself.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.380
- You know that.
- I'm sorry.

04:14.463 --> 04:15.506
It's my final decision.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.508
Ms. Peralta,
when Tom left you in charge,

04:17.591 --> 04:18.926
I don't think that he counted on...

04:19.009 --> 04:20.427
Counted on what, Colonel?

04:20.552 --> 04:22.721
Looking out for
the best interest of Charleston?

04:22.805 --> 04:24.390
Because I believe that's exactly

04:24.473 --> 04:27.434
what he was counting on from me,
and from you, as well.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.395
Ms. Peralta.

04:31.605 --> 04:35.442
I can't expect you to understand

04:35.651 --> 04:37.486
what we in the Second Mass
went through,

04:37.528 --> 04:39.405
but we came out of it a family.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.533
A family dedicated
to each other, come what may.

04:43.492 --> 04:46.328
And that's what the Second Mass
has come to stand for.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.497
That's what we've been
fighting for.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.457
And if one of us is lost,
we find them,

04:50.541 --> 04:52.543
and if one of us is in trouble,
we help them.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.423
Fine. Twenty-four hours.

04:57.506 --> 04:58.382
All right, then.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.508
And if you do find them,

04:59.550 --> 05:02.386
we'll need to figure out a way
how to handle the baby.

05:02.428 --> 05:03.429
What do you mean, "handle"?

05:03.512 --> 05:04.513
Dr. Glass was right.

05:04.555 --> 05:07.558
God knows how people will react
to a hybrid child.

05:10.019 --> 05:12.980
- First things first.
- Yes, first things first.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.440
And by the way...

05:15.399 --> 05:18.569
I had a family, too... Once.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.572
I completely understand
what we're fighting for.

05:23.407 --> 05:24.533
Completely.

to find us.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.445
Or Keystone for that matter.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.280
Yeah, well, considering the fact
that you led them

06:03.364 --> 06:05.366
right to it, I'm surprised it
took them as long as it did.

06:05.449 --> 06:06.617
Could have let you burn
on that plane.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.495
Charleston has a mole.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.455
Everybody knows it.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.457
Only instead of delaying
your trip to Keystone

06:13.540 --> 06:15.334
to find out
who the damn spy was,

06:15.417 --> 06:16.502
you... you wanted to
go and play

06:16.585 --> 06:17.628
with the big boys, didn't you?

06:18.337 --> 06:21.382
Parley with the President
of the United States.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.384
Well, I hope
it was worth it, huh?

06:23.467 --> 06:25.511
You get the President killed,
Bressler's dead.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.558
Tom: It looks like they're leaving.

06:31.642 --> 06:32.559
We got to move.

06:32.643 --> 06:35.354
No, stay here for a while, all
right? Wait until they leave.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.399
- Suit yourself.
- No! Down!

06:40.484 --> 06:41.485
Stay down!

Listen, if there's
one thing I know,

07:06.135 --> 07:08.470
it's how to hide from
the authorities, all right?

- Sir...
- No buts about it, Hal.

That's an order.

happens to him.

to come across as... as un...

Ms. Peralta.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.397
What I wanted to say...
I... I wa...

08:01.607 --> 08:04.401
Just get yourself back to
Charleston safely, Colonel.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.987

08:56.995 --> 08:57.955
Very good.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.124
But you also know that
Charleston has got to be, what,

09:01.166 --> 09:02.459

as the crow flies?

09:02.543 --> 09:04.378
Even if we're covering
three miles an hour,

09:04.461 --> 09:06.338
times 10 hours a day,
if we find a road...

09:06.421 --> 09:07.381
Actually, they'll be
looking for the road,

09:07.464 --> 09:09.007
so we can't even...

09:10.467 --> 09:11.468
Lieutenant Fisher didn't give us

09:11.510 --> 09:12.803
the coordinates
till we were airborne.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.428
What?

09:13.512 --> 09:15.556
Spy couldn't have known
where we were going.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.474
He didn't have the coordinates.
We didn't have the coordinates.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.601
He knew we were going.
He didn't need to know where.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.353
Look, Professor, you know
as well as I do,

09:21.436 --> 09:23.021
they got... they got eyes
in the sky, right?

09:23.105 --> 09:25.357
Then why did it take them
so long to get to Keystone?

09:27.568 --> 09:30.362
You are the king of chaos, Mason.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.488
Do you know that?

It follows you.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.491
Don't try to explain it.

09:34.533 --> 09:35.534
Just own it.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.411
You still owe me an airplane.

It's not Anne.

11:30.899 --> 11:31.900

11:32.943 --> 11:34.778
Could be.
I'm not sure.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.114
We need to bury her.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.449
We don't even know her.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.326
It doesn't matter.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.332
No, Matt's right.
We can't just leave her here.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.376
Come on, Hal.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.460
Come give us a hand.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.143
No, we should keep moving.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.436
Still got a couple hours
of light left.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.354
- Let's go.
- No, we should make a fire.

12:09.438 --> 12:10.480
We need to eat something.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.441
Look, in case
you missed the memo,

12:12.482 --> 12:15.485
fire... is what
attracts them, see?

12:16.486 --> 12:18.447
We could die of exposure,
starvation,

12:18.488 --> 12:20.365
and then it wouldn't matter.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.825
Are you going soft, Mason?

12:21.867 --> 12:23.368
It's not that cold.

12:23.452 --> 12:24.661
It will be
when the sun goes down.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.289
Make a fire.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.499
Yeah, while you do what?

12:29.541 --> 12:32.335
What's the matter, Pope?
You don't know how?

12:32.377 --> 12:33.837
Hey, you know what?

12:33.879 --> 12:35.505
You want your fire
bad enough there,

12:35.547 --> 12:38.425
Mr. Boy Scout,
you make it yourself.

12:38.550 --> 12:39.634
You don't know how, do you?

12:39.676 --> 12:41.344
How could you survive this long

12:41.428 --> 12:42.512
without knowing
how to make a fire?

12:52.981 --> 12:55.984
I just got this image
of young Tommy Mason

12:56.026 --> 12:58.361
out there in the wilderness

"Behold, my son,

13:02.616 --> 13:04.367

of a young Johnny Pope
sitting on his ass

13:06.536 --> 13:09.206
making wisecracks
while the other kids played.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.504
My father wasn't really
the outdoorsman type.

13:16.421 --> 13:19.341
Too busy managing
his stock portfolio, huh?

13:19.382 --> 13:21.384
Owned a hardware store.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.179
Never made it past
the seventh grade.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.597
But he knew his tools.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.935
Well, sounds like my
Norman Rockwell upbringing.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.603
My father was a drunk.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.399
Angry, mean drunk.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.611
There was nothing idyllic
about my childhood.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.406
(BLOWING)

13:43.490 --> 13:45.534
Except that maybe I survived it.

14:01.591 --> 14:02.592
Matt: It's for the tree.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.472
Ben: Think we should...
say something?

14:11.393 --> 14:12.394
All right.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.606
I don't know who this woman was.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.402
She didn't deserve
to die this way.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.405
And she's in a better place.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.447
Amen.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.621
I'm glad we found her.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.458
Do you think she had a family?

14:37.460 --> 14:39.462
Yeah. Probably.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.549
Bet she was a good mother.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.386
Yeah, I'm guessing so.

14:47.637 --> 14:51.433
Probably just...
looking for food for her kids.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.476
Like a good mother would.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.522
Before all this,
probably would have...

14:57.606 --> 15:01.359
taken her daughter for ice cream
after a volleyball game,

15:01.568 --> 15:02.986
even if she lost.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.530
She waited up for her daughter
to come home

15:05.614 --> 15:07.365
from her first date.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.327
Not because she was
worried about her,

15:10.410 --> 15:13.496
but... because she wanted
to hear all about it.

15:14.331 --> 15:15.415
She'll be missed.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.418
But she'll always be loved.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.508
Right.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.428
Let's get her covered up.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.566
Dr. Kadar?

15:44.444 --> 15:45.528
Roger?

15:47.614 --> 15:48.531
Marina!

15:48.615 --> 15:50.367
I know why you're here.

15:50.408 --> 15:51.368
You do?

15:51.409 --> 15:54.621
And I think I have everything
almost ready.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.374
Wh... I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.458
Uh, testing.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.542
What testing?

15:59.584 --> 16:03.380
Lourdes... uh,
that is to say, Dr. Delgado,

16:03.421 --> 16:04.547
gave me a list
of all the children

16:04.631 --> 16:06.549
born in the last six months
here in Charleston,

16:06.591 --> 16:07.634
eight to be exact,

16:08.385 --> 16:10.053
including, of course,
Dr. Glass' child.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.389
And then it was just a matter
of comparing the DNA samples.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.057
Doctor, that's
a very important project,

16:14.182 --> 16:15.392
and I'd like
to discuss it further,

16:15.433 --> 16:17.352
but that's not why I'm here.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.228
All right.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.604
I'm, uh... I'm sorry.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.606
What is it?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.570
This is what the Volm
are building.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.572
Yes.
How did you know?

16:30.407 --> 16:32.409
It's not hard to figure out.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.371
- Where did you get these photos?
- That's not important.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.123
What is important
and what I hope you can tell me

16:38.206 --> 16:40.417
is what this thing does exactly.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.419
"Exactly?"
From these photos?

16:42.502 --> 16:43.545
Well, you're the only one
I could think of

16:43.586 --> 16:45.588
who could possibly
figure it out.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.383
All right. <i>I'll</i> try.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.592
That's all I can ask.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.386
Marina...

16:51.428 --> 16:52.345
Yes.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.305
Does Tom Mason know about this?

16:54.389 --> 16:55.348
Yes.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.350
He's the one who asked me
to come here.

17:06.443 --> 17:07.444
Matt.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.245
Not hungry-

17:17.287 --> 17:19.497
Well, you should eat anyway.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.422
Do you think Mom died alone?

17:29.215 --> 17:30.467
Like... that woman?

17:32.469 --> 17:34.637
Um... I don't know.

17:35.472 --> 17:36.639
I don't know.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.477
I hope not.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.482
You remember the last time
you saw Mom?

17:46.483 --> 17:47.525
Yeah.

17:48.651 --> 17:51.488
I... saw her leaving that morning

17:51.571 --> 17:53.531
just through the window.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.408
All I could see was the bottom
of her legs

17:55.492 --> 17:57.744
from where I was sitting,
her jeans,

17:57.827 --> 18:00.413
pink Nikes Dad got her
for that cancer run.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.417
Yeah, I... I remember.

18:05.502 --> 18:06.628
The next time I saw her,

18:07.504 --> 18:09.422
she was lying on the picnic table
in the backyard

18:09.506 --> 18:11.591
after Dad had gone
and found her.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.427
One of her shoes was missing.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.471
I should have gone to look
for that shoe.

18:21.476 --> 18:22.602
We're going to find her, right?

18:23.478 --> 18:24.604
Anne, I mean.

18:26.523 --> 18:27.524
We're going to try.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.366
Hey. Eat.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.083
Thanks.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.918
For what?

18:47.001 --> 18:48.628
Not lying-

18:54.509 --> 18:57.595
Pope: Huh? I'll tell you,
a little white wine,

18:57.679 --> 18:58.513
lemon and garlic,

18:58.555 --> 19:00.557
cayenne pepper,
it'd be almost edible.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.353
You much of a cook, Mason?

19:05.395 --> 19:06.396
No.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.439
Rebecca did most of the cooking.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.610
I used to make breakfast
for the boys...

19:13.528 --> 19:15.405
On Saturdays sometimes.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.411
I liked the smell of bacon
and hash browns in the house.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.412
Mm.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.081
I wasn't much of a cook
when my kids were around.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.292
That's right.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.418
You've got two, right?

19:28.459 --> 19:29.586
Pope: A boy and a girl.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.421
Brandon and Tanya.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.590
When was the last time
you saw them?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.346
All right.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.557
It was five years
before the invasion.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.603
Me and, uh... me and my boy
were working on his mini-bike.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.230
Had this sweet little
old-school Honda

19:49.272 --> 19:50.607
that his uncle gave him.

19:52.442 --> 19:55.445
And, uh, swapping out
the rear sprocket...

19:55.612 --> 19:57.405
Give the kid a little extra
torque, you know?

19:57.447 --> 20:00.575
He's riding down the driveway,
and this jackass...

20:01.451 --> 20:04.537
In a Cadillac...
by that much, man.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.623
Almost just run him
right down, right?

20:07.457 --> 20:08.541
I told this guy before.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.585
So, I throw Brandon
into the truck.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.962
We follow this son of a bitch,
get out to his house.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.339
He gets out of his car.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.382
I tell him, "Hey, man, we got
kids playing in the street."

20:16.466 --> 20:18.509
He tells me,
"Yeah, well, get a haircut.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.553
Shut your pie hole."

20:21.596 --> 20:23.473
And I popped him.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.393
So he goes down.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.313
And, uh...
(CHUCKLING)

20:30.396 --> 20:32.357
I actually...
I started laughing

20:32.440 --> 20:35.985
because his... his, uh...
his head sounded like a melon...

20:36.069 --> 20:37.528
when it hit the asphalt.

20:40.615 --> 20:43.576
I'll never forget the look
on Brandon's face, though, boy.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.456
Just... I was just
trying to teach him

20:48.498 --> 20:51.584
how to stand up for yourself,
you know?

20:53.503 --> 20:55.546
That's... that's all I was doing.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.884
What happened to the guy?
He sue you?

21:01.177 --> 21:03.096
No, he bled out on the driveway.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.516
He ended up dead.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.311
You know what, Mason?

21:10.395 --> 21:14.607
I was never cut out
for the... the home life...

21:14.691 --> 21:16.484
homeowner crap.

21:16.651 --> 21:18.444
Just never my thing, you know?

21:18.569 --> 21:19.612
And prison...

21:21.614 --> 21:22.532
prison was easy.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.409
Prison, I... I understood.

21:24.534 --> 21:27.370
You know, that other stuff...

21:42.427 --> 21:44.595
I was just gonna take
the first watch.

22:02.488 --> 22:05.158
(POPE LAUGHING)

22:05.575 --> 22:07.702
Whoo-hoo!

22:07.744 --> 22:08.411
I don't know about you,

22:08.494 --> 22:09.579
but I'm getting a little tired
of frog legs.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.497
I thought we'd go epicurean
this morning.

22:11.581 --> 22:12.874
You think that's funny?

22:12.915 --> 22:14.083
(LAUGHING)

22:14.125 --> 22:16.461
Ain't nothing funny
about eating snake, man.

22:17.545 --> 22:18.546
Asshole.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.049
It's a joke, you puss.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.425
Oh, you think we're friends now?

22:22.508 --> 22:25.595
Share a few campfire stories,
and now we're blood-brothers?

22:31.893 --> 22:33.186
(GRUNTING)

22:49.494 --> 22:50.703
(SHOUTING)

22:51.662 --> 22:53.289
Come on!

23:00.588 --> 23:02.715
(SCREECHING)

23:07.512 --> 23:09.389
(CHITTERING)

23:22.735 --> 23:24.487

(ROARING)

23:35.081 --> 23:37.333
(SCREECHING IN DISTANCE)

23:37.708 --> 23:39.585
Move it, Mason!
Move it!

23:50.513 --> 23:51.514
They're flanking us.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.853
(PANTING)

23:58.479 --> 23:59.522
Whoa, whoa.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.402
It was nice knowing you, Mason.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.114
(SCREECHING)

24:10.575 --> 24:12.201
Get out of the way.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.036
No, no, no. I saw that movie.
No way.

24:14.078 --> 24:16.080
- You got a better idea?
- No!

24:16.164 --> 24:17.081
(SHOUTING)

24:18.332 --> 24:20.209
(SPLASHING)

24:30.553 --> 24:33.139
(BIRDS CALLING)

24:33.222 --> 24:35.391
(BOTH COUGHING)

24:37.685 --> 24:39.896
(PANTING)

24:48.571 --> 24:50.406
(COCKING GUN) You want to die?!

24:50.448 --> 24:51.365
Try that again!

24:51.407 --> 24:52.825
Let's finish it.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.162
Let's finish it!

24:58.581 --> 24:59.582
It's finished.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.251
You win.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.212
(POPE LAUGHING)

25:05.880 --> 25:08.049
Do I want to die?

25:08.090 --> 25:10.009
That's rich.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.552
Mason, you honestly think...

25:11.636 --> 25:13.596
we're getting out of here
any other way?

25:16.766 --> 25:18.184
(GROANING IN PAIN)

25:20.269 --> 25:21.896
Pope: What?

25:21.938 --> 25:23.940
It's my ankle.

25:23.981 --> 25:26.359
(SHOUTS)

25:27.360 --> 25:28.903
(GROANING)

25:32.156 --> 25:33.157
Let's get dry.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.465
How you doing, Jeannie?

25:50.424 --> 25:51.384
I don't know.

25:52.593 --> 25:53.553
What's wrong?

25:55.388 --> 25:57.557
Just wondering
if this is how it all ends.

25:58.558 --> 25:59.517
How what ends?

26:00.560 --> 26:03.437
They can't kill us.
They can't dominate us.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.398
So they just turn us into them?

26:05.523 --> 26:08.401
Create a new species,
half-human, half-alien?

26:08.609 --> 26:10.444
I don't know.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.449
Dad, you have to
promise me something.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.536
You know if I can, I will.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.455
Don't let them get me, okay?

26:22.623 --> 26:24.417
What are you talking about?

26:24.584 --> 26:25.585
You know.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.337
Please.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.464
I don't want them
to use me for...

26:31.424 --> 26:33.551
Just promise me,
no matter what, you won't.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.306
Never, ever.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.473
I promise.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.026
Dismount.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.360
Let's spread out.

26:51.444 --> 26:52.528
See what we can see.

26:59.493 --> 27:00.661
Hey. You okay?

27:00.703 --> 27:02.538
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

27:03.497 --> 27:05.625
You've just been acting weird
this whole time. That's all.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.545
This just doesn't
make a whole lot of sense.

27:09.587 --> 27:10.546
I mean, look.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.632
Anne, the baby,
they could be anywhere.

27:13.466 --> 27:14.383
If Anne doesn't
want to be found,

27:14.467 --> 27:16.510
she's smart enough,
she's not going to be found.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.971
We have to try, right?

27:19.055 --> 27:20.514
I guess so, yeah.

27:20.598 --> 27:22.350
Ben: Skitter tracks.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.480
Some human prints, too.

27:27.605 --> 27:28.814
Can't tell how many.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.362
They've got her.

27:38.616 --> 27:40.743
We can't be sure, son.

27:40.826 --> 27:43.412
Rebel Skitters, they have spies
in the Espheni system.

27:43.454 --> 27:45.456
If anyone can find Anne
and Lexie, it's them.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.417
If they're still alive.

27:50.628 --> 27:55.549
Listen. Anne and your baby
sister are most certainly alive.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.426
All right?

27:57.593 --> 27:58.552
How can you be sure?

27:58.594 --> 28:01.389
Because if they weren't,
we would have found them.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.432
Now, we don't give up hope ever.

28:03.516 --> 28:04.517
You don't.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.352
And that's an order.

28:06.560 --> 28:07.603
Yes, sir.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.321
When we get back, we'll talk
to your Skitter friends.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.448
And we're going to launch
those rebel spies.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.619
Let's mount up and head home.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.262
Pope: Give me the belt.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.558
There had to have been
a tracking device on the airplane.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.810
That's the only explanation.

28:47.852 --> 28:49.019
What the hell
are you talking about?

28:49.103 --> 28:51.355
That's how they knew
we were at Keystone.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.649
Look, you got to
let that go, Mason.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.151
It doesn't matter anymore.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.277
It's gonna get tight.

28:56.318 --> 28:59.071
(GROANING)
- We gotta get moving.

29:01.949 --> 29:04.034
Let's go.
Get some weight on it.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.163
- Come on. Got it?
(SCREAMING)

29:09.457 --> 29:11.792
Damn it, Mason.
We don't have a choice.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.544
(SIGHING)

29:16.464 --> 29:17.882
Look, Mason, we gotta go.

29:20.634 --> 29:22.386
You hear me?

29:22.470 --> 29:24.305
We're gonna die out here.

29:24.346 --> 29:27.224
We gotta go,
and we gotta go now.

29:27.308 --> 29:28.893
(PANTING)

29:28.976 --> 29:29.518
Go.

29:29.643 --> 29:31.479
No, no. Come on.
I'm not leaving without you.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.481
That's not gonna happen.
One more time. Come on.

29:33.522 --> 29:35.357
Let's go.
Let's do it.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.361
Just go.
You got what you wanted.

29:39.487 --> 29:40.571
You get to walk out
of the woods.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.406
It's not gonna work that way.

29:43.616 --> 29:46.202
You are gonna get off your ass,

29:46.285 --> 29:48.537
get dressed,
and we are going to move.

29:55.419 --> 29:57.505
You owe me an airplane.
That's it.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.673
That is the only reason that I
am hauling your ass out of here.

29:59.715 --> 30:00.716
You understand that?

30:00.800 --> 30:02.426
What are you gonna do
with an airplane?

30:02.510 --> 30:04.345
You got motorcycles.
You got Humvees.

30:04.386 --> 30:05.554
You can leave Charleston
anytime you want.

30:05.596 --> 30:07.223
Why don't you 90?

30:07.264 --> 30:08.265
If I did all that,

30:08.349 --> 30:10.267
I think I'd miss out
on all the fun and adventure.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.522
Oh, man, it must be nice
to be John Pope,

30:14.563 --> 30:16.565
to live life
with no responsibility,

30:16.607 --> 30:19.360
no accountability,
no sense of obligation,

30:19.401 --> 30:20.986
no sense of duty,
no sense of honor,

30:21.070 --> 30:22.404
and no sense of remorse!

30:22.446 --> 30:23.906
- That must be nice!
- Shut up.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.282
You're a fake!

30:26.534 --> 30:27.535
You're a phony!

30:30.496 --> 30:32.873
You are a coward.

30:32.915 --> 30:34.416
I'm gonna die out here.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.418
You're gonna die out here
because you don't have the balls

30:36.502 --> 30:38.379
to walk out of here without me!

30:43.008 --> 30:45.177
(TOM PANTING)

31:12.454 --> 31:15.207
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

31:40.482 --> 31:41.525
I don't like that look.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.447
It doesn't add up.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.324
What doesn't add up?

31:50.492 --> 31:52.369
Let's say you had a toaster

31:52.453 --> 31:53.579
that you wanted me
to power up for you.

31:53.662 --> 31:57.333
Most household appliances
use between 300 and 900 watts.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.501
So that's what I'd provide.
That's all I'd provide.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.379
I wouldn't go to the trouble of
creating a system that gives,

32:02.463 --> 32:04.465
say, 25,000 watts,

32:04.506 --> 32:06.467
which would be enough to run
an electric furnace,

32:06.508 --> 32:08.594
because that would be... overkill.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.348
So, what about this device
is overkill?

32:13.432 --> 32:16.518
This thing right here
is connected,

32:16.560 --> 32:19.355
like some kind of
massive accumulator.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.607
It's, uh... like
an energy storage device.

32:22.358 --> 32:24.443
And if this weapon
uses plasma armature

32:24.526 --> 32:26.987
and I... think it does, then...

32:28.989 --> 32:33.035
It would never
need that much power,

32:33.118 --> 32:35.162
not even by a long shot.

32:35.204 --> 32:36.538
It would be...

32:36.622 --> 32:39.708
- It would be overkill.
(KADAR CHUCKLING)

32:39.750 --> 32:41.043
Exactly.

32:41.085 --> 32:43.420
So, maybe it's not
what we think it is?

32:43.504 --> 32:45.422
Or what the Volm
are telling us it is.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.383
What are the Volm
telling us it is?

32:47.466 --> 32:48.467
I don't know.

32:48.550 --> 32:49.551
You don't know?

32:51.553 --> 32:54.014
Tom Mason didn't ask you
to look into this, did he?

32:54.056 --> 32:55.557
No, he didn't.

32:57.393 --> 32:58.477
And he should have.

32:59.561 --> 33:01.480
He should have told us all.

33:05.609 --> 33:06.819
Thank you, Doctor.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.405
I assume you won't
tell anyone about this.

33:09.446 --> 33:12.074
I think that would be
for the best.

33:13.450 --> 33:16.328
I do have the DNA results back,
by the way,

33:16.412 --> 33:17.454
- if you're interested.
- Results?

33:17.579 --> 33:20.249
The DNA results
from the newborns.

33:21.583 --> 33:22.418
And?

33:22.501 --> 33:24.628
They're all negative,
except the Glass child.

33:24.712 --> 33:26.171
That's good.

33:26.422 --> 33:28.507
Yes.
It is, I think.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.385
I think it's very good.

34:09.923 --> 34:11.383
How did you find me?

34:11.467 --> 34:12.509
- They're here. We gotta go.
- Who's here?

34:12.593 --> 34:14.470
We don't have much time.
We have to get up.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.972
They need your help. You gotta
get up right now! Come on, Dad!

One of you doesn't
go home tonight.

34:53.383 --> 34:55.928
Is it you? Or you?

35:11.610 --> 35:13.487
There's only one thing
on this planet

35:13.529 --> 35:15.531
I can't stand
more than you, Mason.

35:17.533 --> 35:18.951
That's Skitters.

35:31.588 --> 35:33.215
Pope: Almost there.

35:36.552 --> 35:38.512
It ain't a Harley, but it'll do.

35:39.388 --> 35:41.557
There's also enough...
gas in this thing.

35:41.598 --> 35:43.392
It should get us
most of the way home.

35:47.479 --> 35:50.607
The folks that owned this tub
weren't much on...

35:50.899 --> 35:52.526
fine dining...

35:53.443 --> 35:57.364
But, uh... they keep
a good supply of 12 gauge.

35:57.447 --> 35:58.448
Oh, here.

35:59.616 --> 36:02.077
The shocks on this buggy
are crap.

Yeah.

Hey.

Yeah, look, I just think we
should get our stories straight.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.352
What story would that be?

38:32.477 --> 38:34.521
You saved my ass.
I saved yours.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.398
I'd say that makes us even.

Well, you know what they say
about a tie.

Hey. Welcome back.

39:15.479 --> 39:16.521

to say this, Tom,
