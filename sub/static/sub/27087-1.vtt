02:27.016 --> 02:29.627
- [Sergeant Silva] Fuck,
 this doesn't look good, sir.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.325
- [Lieutenant] What
 does that mean?

02:31.368 --> 02:35.590
- [Sergeant Silva] Fuckin'
 radiator hose is busted.

02:38.854 --> 02:42.466
Mills, did you check this when
 you signed out the paperwork?

02:42.510 --> 02:43.728
- Uh, roger, Sergeant.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.165
They said everything
 was good to go.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.167
- And you inspected the truck?

02:47.210 --> 02:48.298
- Yeah, sort of.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.170
- What do you mean sort of?

02:50.213 --> 02:52.955
- Well, sir, I looked
at it from the outside.

02:52.998 --> 02:56.393
- Dammit Mills, you didn't
 look under the hood?

02:56.437 --> 02:57.655
- If I did, I really
 wouldn't be able

02:57.699 --> 03:00.092
to identify the radiator hose.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.226
- Sergeant, how much longer
 on the truck repairs?

03:03.270 --> 03:04.532
- Repair, sir?

03:04.575 --> 03:06.403
- Yeah, we can't stay on
this road for very long.

03:06.447 --> 03:07.752
- Well, I'm not a
 fuckin' mechanic

03:07.796 --> 03:09.232
and even if I was, we
 don't have the proper parts

03:09.276 --> 03:10.886
to fix this thing.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.540
Mills, call in our grid.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.803
Hey, what the fuck
 are you doing?

03:14.846 --> 03:16.326
- Just--

03:16.370 --> 03:17.632
- Hey, your pictures aren't
 helping out right now.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.068
- Well, Avery, go ahead
and take your photos.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.157
- Hey, this isn't the time
 to play celebrity, sir.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.159
- Now, I have direct
 orders from the top

03:23.203 --> 03:25.857
saying that Avery over
here has full disclosure

03:25.901 --> 03:26.989
of our mission.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.339
These are top orders, Sergeant.

03:29.383 --> 03:30.819
Don't make this more than it is.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.342
- Right, sir.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.562
Alright, well Paparazzi,
if he's gonna let us,

03:34.605 --> 03:38.827
we need to get out of our
 current situation right now.

03:40.089 --> 03:42.091
Mills, call in our grid.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.268
- This is F.O. Team to outpost.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.313
Do you copy?

03:47.923 --> 03:49.141
F.O. Team to outpost.

03:49.185 --> 03:50.839
Do you copy?

03:50.882 --> 03:51.883
- [Lieutenant] Are
 you getting anything

03:51.927 --> 03:53.537
through the transmitter?

03:53.581 --> 03:54.321
- Negative, sir.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.974
Only hear a low hum.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.455
- We must be far enough
behind enemy lines

03:58.499 --> 04:00.370
if they've already
 jammed our radios.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.284
- Mills, you're
 probably dehydrated.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.504
Drink some water.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.419
- Sergeant, we've
 had 32 other missions

04:05.462 --> 04:07.899
and I've never had a
 problem as a radio operator.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.118
- Alright, Mills.

04:09.161 --> 04:11.816
Now, we need to get
 off this road and now.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.340
If any of the enemy
 locals come by,

04:13.383 --> 04:15.820
they're gonna alert the
 real enemy of our presence.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.909
- Well, if you
 wanna play soldier,

04:17.952 --> 04:19.868
you can help us take
this truck off the road.

04:19.911 --> 04:21.261
- Roger, Sergeant.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.054
- [Lieutenant] Alright,
 let's move this thing, squad.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.795
- [Avery] Yes, sir.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.798
- [Lieutenant] On
 the count of three.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.756
One, two, three.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.845

04:42.717 --> 04:43.935

04:49.680 --> 04:52.074
To hell with this,
 let's do this.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.470
- [Sergeant Silva] Just
wanna leave it, sir?

04:56.513 --> 04:57.775
Fuck it.

04:57.819 --> 04:58.907
- We're gonna leave it
on the side of the road.

04:58.950 --> 04:59.821
Let's get off the
 road and take cover.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.126
Silva, you take lead.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.432
Squad, file up.

07:18.699 --> 07:22.920
There's nothing like an early
 morning in enemy territory.

07:24.966 --> 07:27.577
Now, let's go ahead
 and figure out

07:27.621 --> 07:30.450
what the hell we're
 gonna do here.

07:36.717 --> 07:37.500
Alright.

07:39.067 --> 07:42.200
Now, this is the outpost from
 which we left this morning.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.551
We traveled about
 six miles or so

07:44.594 --> 07:47.684
to the enemy line and then
 about another six miles or so.

07:47.728 --> 07:51.079
I'd say we broke down
 about right there.

07:51.122 --> 07:54.169
Now, we're supposed to
 get a little bit further.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.693
Make it down to where we
 can call in an air strike

07:56.737 --> 07:58.652
for where the enemy has
 stationed their field trucks.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.002
We were going to make
it to this point, here,

08:01.045 --> 08:05.223
and call in that air strike
 and everything goes boom.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.096
Looks like my first mission's

08:08.139 --> 08:10.925
gonna have to be a failed one.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.623
- What about this point, sir?

08:13.667 --> 08:17.497
- It's about six miles
 from where we are.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.672
- Well, can we make it there?

08:18.715 --> 08:21.152
I'll carry Private
Paparazzi if I have to.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.067
- We don't have the water
 or rations for that.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.721
We were only
 prepped for 36 hours

08:24.765 --> 08:25.983
with vehicular

08:27.724 --> 08:29.117
and radio support.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.294
- Hey, Mills, try
 the radio again.

08:35.035 --> 08:36.167
- F.O. Team to outpost.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.212
Do you copy?

08:39.344 --> 08:40.780
Still the low hum.

08:40.823 --> 08:42.347
- Patch me through.

08:44.261 --> 08:45.481
This is F.O. Leader to outpost.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.526
Do you copy?

08:49.398 --> 08:51.139
Yup, there's that low hum.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.663
It's a signal I heard
 in training exercises.

08:53.707 --> 08:56.536
We're definitely having
our radios jammed.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.625
- We don't have very
many options here, sir.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.017
- No, we don't.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.762
Now, taking that road without
 any cover is a death wish.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.155
Well, hold on.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.244
Now, this river here,
 this goes exactly

09:09.287 --> 09:10.462
where we need to go.

09:10.506 --> 09:11.899
If we just followed
 that, it would take us

09:11.942 --> 09:14.118
right back to the green.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.250
- So, that's your plan, sir?

09:15.293 --> 09:17.078
Go down river?

09:17.121 --> 09:18.601
- Yeah.

09:18.645 --> 09:22.387
- Sir, that's right in the
 enemy's concentrated area.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.389
- Well, we wait until nightfall.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.435
We build a raft and we
 slip right past 'em.

09:26.478 --> 09:28.263
They won't even
 know we're there.

09:28.306 --> 09:29.569
- Listen, sir.

09:29.612 --> 09:30.831
I know you haven't done
this very many times,

09:30.874 --> 09:32.528
but the enemy isn't
 just not gonna notice.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.923
- Well, this is going
 through the enemy perimeter.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.620
There's minimal
 chance of contact,

09:37.664 --> 09:42.494
plus these roads are used
 for logistical support.

09:42.538 --> 09:46.629
Or we could go with
 your plan, Sergeant.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.544
- Alright, Mills.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.199
Just you and [mumbles]
 toward the base camp

09:51.242 --> 09:52.548
and get us there, alright?

09:52.592 --> 09:54.202
- Roger, Sergeant.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.597
- Hey, Private Paparazzi.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.598
Since you don't have a weapon,

09:58.641 --> 10:00.208
stay close to us, alright?

10:00.251 --> 10:02.645
- Look, with your shotgun
 you can end someone's life.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.953
You know with my camera, I
 can make 'em live forever.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.476
- Your instructors
 told you that?

10:07.519 --> 10:08.303
- Yeah.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.218
I got the better weapon.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.132
- Well, I doubt
 they've ever been

10:11.175 --> 10:12.307
stuck behind enemy lines.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.961
Come on, let's go.

Let's stay here.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.987
Let's take a break,
 drink some water.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.642
- [Lieutenant] I agree, I agree.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.605
- [Sergeant Silva] Drink
some water privates.

11:33.649 --> 11:36.478
[distant booming]

11:36.521 --> 11:39.524
- [Lieutenant]
 Anybody need a snack?

11:43.354 --> 11:45.313
- You guys are good?

11:45.356 --> 11:46.314
How your feet?

11:47.837 --> 11:50.666
- [Mills] They
 hurt, but I'm good.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.148
- Keep your eyes
peeled everyone.

11:54.191 --> 11:55.671
- [Sergeant Silva]
 Hey, Paparazzi.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.454
- [Avery] Yeah,
 just tell me when

11:56.498 --> 11:58.761
you want your picture.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.197
- How are your feet, sir?

12:00.241 --> 12:00.937
- What's that?

12:00.981 --> 12:02.330
- How are your feet?

12:02.373 --> 12:03.200
- My feet are great.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.375
- Yeah.

12:04.419 --> 12:05.028
- I don't know about yours.

12:05.072 --> 12:05.812
How are yours?

12:05.855 --> 12:08.205
- They're alright.

12:08.249 --> 12:09.293
- Good to hear.

12:10.555 --> 12:11.731
I wouldn't be too
 worried about me.

12:11.774 --> 12:15.299
I was a endurance
runner back in college.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.172
- [Sergeant Silva] Okay, sir.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.130
- I did track once.

12:20.174 --> 12:20.914
- Yeah?

12:20.957 --> 12:21.828
- Once or twice, yeah.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.351
- Couldn't stick with it?

12:23.394 --> 12:25.222
Ah, you like that artsy
stuff too much, hum?

12:25.266 --> 12:27.050
[chuckling]

12:27.094 --> 12:28.486
- Are you guys ready to go?

12:28.530 --> 12:29.400
- [Mills] Yep.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.011
- Just get us outta here.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.664
- [Mills] Roger, Sergeant.

12:32.708 --> 12:35.015
[rustling]

12:52.119 --> 12:54.512
[tense music]

13:45.737 --> 13:46.956
- [Lieutenant]
 Thank you, Sergeant.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.175
- [Sergeant Silva]
 No problem, sir.

13:48.218 --> 13:49.567
- You can bet I appreciate it.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.743
- You should probably
 bring your own camel back.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.354
- Thank you, Sergeant.

14:38.573 --> 14:41.184
Now, Sergeant, I'm
 thinking that we go

14:41.228 --> 14:42.359
straight through this valley.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.579
What do you think?

14:44.622 --> 14:46.363
- Ah, it's not a
 very good idea, sir.

14:46.407 --> 14:47.408
- Well, it's the quickest way.

14:47.451 --> 14:49.497
It's one direct route.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.456
- Yeah, but I bet you there's
 snipers all over this place,

14:52.500 --> 14:53.631
like up there and up there.

14:53.675 --> 14:54.937
That's where I'd be.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.721
- Well, take out
 those binoculars.

14:56.765 --> 14:57.505
Take a look around.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.028
See what you see.

14:59.072 --> 15:01.813
[distant booming]

15:20.658 --> 15:21.616
See anything?

15:21.659 --> 15:23.487
- Yeah, right there, sir.

15:23.531 --> 15:26.273
Looks like one of
 our uniformed guys.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.578
Seems like he's down.

15:27.622 --> 15:30.799
Like I said, snipers
 all over these hills.

15:32.409 --> 15:35.282
- Mills, we got an anomaly
 up there behind that bush.

15:35.325 --> 15:36.587
Why don't you go check it out?

15:36.631 --> 15:37.371
- No, fuck that, Mills.

15:37.414 --> 15:38.502
Stay right there.

15:38.546 --> 15:39.460
- [Lieutenant] That
 is an order, Mills.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.462
Go and check it out.

15:41.505 --> 15:42.593
- Roger, sir.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.815
[distant booming]

16:03.527 --> 16:06.443
[drumbeat music]

16:11.057 --> 16:12.841
- [Mills] What the...?

16:17.541 --> 16:20.109
[booming]

16:20.153 --> 16:21.067
- [Lieutenant] Mills!

16:21.110 --> 16:22.546
Get back here!

16:22.590 --> 16:23.417
Oh my God!

16:25.854 --> 16:27.682
- See, I fucking told you, sir.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.162
That thing is fucking
 booby trapped.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.554
- Okay, but where the hell
 else are we supposed to go?

16:30.598 --> 16:31.816
We don't have food.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.688
We don't have rations
 for anything else.

16:33.731 --> 16:34.471
- [Sergeant Silva] Why
 don't we just stick

16:34.515 --> 16:35.864
to the fucking treeline?

16:35.907 --> 16:38.040
- Why don't we take a
 diagonal through the valley?

16:38.084 --> 16:39.302
I mean, shit, that
 could have been

16:39.346 --> 16:40.869
just a leftover
 mine from ages ago.

16:40.912 --> 16:41.652
- A diagonal?

16:41.696 --> 16:42.871
Sir.

16:42.914 --> 16:43.785
I know you're
 fucking new to this,

16:43.828 --> 16:45.004
but no, that's not gonna work.

16:45.047 --> 16:45.917
- No, listen, listen.

16:45.961 --> 16:46.831
I've been through training.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.094
I know what I'm supposed to do.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.138
The only way we're
 gonna get there

16:49.182 --> 16:51.532
is go through this valley.

16:51.575 --> 16:54.665
- Well, sir, this
valley was taken from us

16:54.709 --> 16:57.668
about two months ago while you
 were still playing beer pong.

16:57.712 --> 16:58.582
- What is that supposed to mean?

16:58.626 --> 16:59.496
- Look, we can't take--

16:59.540 --> 17:00.758
- Now, listen to me, Sergeant.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.630
I'm the one giving
 orders here, alright?

17:02.673 --> 17:04.284
- Alright sir,
 well, check it out.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.112
That's gonna fucking
 get us killed.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.549
That's gonna get
us fucking home.

17:08.592 --> 17:09.854
So which do you wanna do?

17:09.897 --> 17:12.727
You wanna die or do
 you wanna go home?

17:14.119 --> 17:15.685
- I wanna go home.

17:15.730 --> 17:16.599
- Cool.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.079
- You can guarantee me of that?

17:18.124 --> 17:21.518
- Hell yes, sir, if we stick
 to this fucking treeline.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.304
- I'll give it to you
 this time, Sergeant,

17:24.347 --> 17:27.568
but don't you ever talk to me
 back again like that, alright?

17:27.611 --> 17:28.786
- Roger, sir.

17:28.830 --> 17:29.744
- Alright.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.050
You're taking point.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.790
Mills, are you alright?

17:32.834 --> 17:34.792
- [Mills] Roger, sir.

17:35.750 --> 17:36.794
- Avery?

17:42.409 --> 17:44.019
You're taking point.

17:45.586 --> 17:46.326
- [Sergeant Silva] Alright guys.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.850
Let's get out of here.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.679
[distant booming]

17:57.598 --> 18:00.296
[drumbeat music]

18:57.440 --> 19:00.313
[gunshots booming]

19:02.880 --> 19:04.621
- Mills, what the fuck?

19:04.665 --> 19:06.971
We're not supposed
 to be this close.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.625
Fuck.

19:08.669 --> 19:09.757
Mills, we're not supposed to
 be this close to the action.

19:09.800 --> 19:10.888
What are you doing?

19:10.932 --> 19:12.890
- This the way the
 compass says to go.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.197
- Gimme that thing.

19:15.241 --> 19:18.853
[distant gunfire booming]

19:23.945 --> 19:24.685
Follow me.

19:24.728 --> 19:25.773
Let's go.

19:54.149 --> 19:56.325
Sir, I can hear the river.

19:57.283 --> 20:00.547
[tense drumbeat music]

20:35.321 --> 20:38.237
[crisp beat music]

21:01.477 --> 21:04.263
- [Lieutenant] Come
on, down on the ground.

21:04.306 --> 21:05.742
Whoa, stay calm Sergeant.

21:05.786 --> 21:06.743
- This is calm.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.005
- This is a native of the land.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.964
He's not necessarily the enemy.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.879
- Well, he can tell
 where the enemy's at.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.968
Guess we'll just detain him.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.491
- Alright, alright.

21:17.972 --> 21:18.755
Now.

21:21.584 --> 21:22.803
He's unarmed.

21:22.846 --> 21:24.413
We're detaining him.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.067
What should we do next?

21:26.110 --> 21:27.590
- [Sergeant Silva]
Guess we could take him

21:27.634 --> 21:30.811
back up to the treeline, figure
out what to do from there.

21:30.854 --> 21:31.855
- Alright.

21:31.899 --> 21:34.989
Alright, that's a good idea.

21:35.032 --> 21:38.384
- [Mills] Should just
 kill him right here.

21:39.863 --> 21:42.257
- Come on, you son of a bitch.

21:44.607 --> 21:45.913
Come on, come on.

21:48.916 --> 21:49.917
There we go.

21:51.222 --> 21:53.050
Well done, Sergeant.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.404
Let's take him to a
 more secure location.

21:58.447 --> 22:00.623
- [Sergeant Silva] Alright.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.451
- Come on, you bastard.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.544
[tense drumbeat music]

22:20.426 --> 22:21.818
- Policy, sir,
 killing the detainee

22:21.862 --> 22:24.560
is probably the best
 course of action.

22:24.604 --> 22:27.520
- That is a war crime that
 I'm not comfortable with.

22:27.563 --> 22:28.347
- Who cares?

22:28.390 --> 22:29.870
It's one filthy native.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.915
He's probably thinking
 about killing us right now.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.874
- How the hell do
 you know that he's

22:33.917 --> 22:35.310
thinking about killing us?

22:35.354 --> 22:37.921
And besides, Private
 Avery has full disclosure

22:37.965 --> 22:39.401
of our mission.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.489
- What, are you a snitch now?

22:40.533 --> 22:41.316
- What?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.230
- Hey, leave him alone.

22:42.273 --> 22:43.753
Shut the hell up.

22:43.797 --> 22:47.496
Nothing happens to this
 detainee until the L.T. says.

22:48.802 --> 22:51.587
- The plan is that we
 wait until nightfall,

22:51.631 --> 22:54.329
we build a raft and then
 we get the hell outta here.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.418
Now, what we'll do
 is until nightfall,

22:56.462 --> 22:58.638
we'll take turns
 guarding this guy

22:58.681 --> 23:00.030
and then we'll get out.

23:00.074 --> 23:00.857
- [Sergeant Silva]
 Sounds good to me.

23:00.901 --> 23:01.945
- [Lieutenant] Alright.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.164
- Shit, I'll take
 the first watch.

23:03.207 --> 23:04.470
- [Lieutenant] You sure
you can handle that?

23:04.513 --> 23:05.906
- [Sergeant Silva]
 He'll be fine.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.211
- Alright.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.474
Well, Silv's up.

23:08.517 --> 23:09.779
Avery and I will go get
logs and get that raft

23:09.823 --> 23:13.435
started so we can get
 the hell outta here.

23:13.479 --> 23:14.262
You're on point, Silva.

23:14.305 --> 23:15.089
Let's go.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.270
Watch him close, Mills.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.107
[thudding]

23:34.238 --> 23:38.112
- [Lieutenant] Okay
 Avery, keep it up.

23:38.155 --> 23:41.985
- Sir, what do you think we
 should do with that native?

23:42.029 --> 23:45.075
I mean, what do honestly
think we should do?

23:45.119 --> 23:45.989
- Honestly?

23:47.295 --> 23:49.210
I really, really
 hope that we can just

23:49.253 --> 23:52.648
cut him loose and let him
 go when we get outta here.

23:52.692 --> 23:56.130
- As long as we're on our
 way out, I can do that.

23:56.173 --> 23:58.219
[thudding]

24:04.617 --> 24:05.661
- [Lieutenant] Keep
 at it, Sergeant.

24:05.705 --> 24:07.097
It'll come down eventually.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.056
[thudding]

24:09.099 --> 24:10.144
- [Avery] I think we
 would have won the war

24:10.187 --> 24:11.450
by the time this
 branch comes down.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.495
- [Sergeant Silva]
 Fuck you, Avery.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.889
[thudding]

24:23.636 --> 24:26.726
- Yo, why won't you
 fuckin' look at me?

24:26.769 --> 24:28.423
Are you fuckin' scared?

24:28.467 --> 24:30.120
What the fuck is your problem?

24:30.164 --> 24:33.080
I bet you know where the
 enemy is right now, don't you?

24:33.123 --> 24:33.994
They're probably
 just sittin' here

24:34.037 --> 24:37.040
waitin' to kill my brothers.

24:37.084 --> 24:40.000
I'm not dealin'
 with this bullshit.

24:42.524 --> 24:45.179
- You know, if the
continents hadn't split,

24:45.222 --> 24:48.878
would we still wage
 war the way we do?

24:48.922 --> 24:51.968
- I think if that were the
 case, we'd already be extinct.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.535
- Yeah, probably.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.583
- You know, sometimes you
 gotta put fear into your enemy

24:57.626 --> 24:59.715
in order to gain
respect to your nation.

24:59.759 --> 25:02.936
- Yeah, or you could
 just adopt Communism,

25:02.979 --> 25:06.069
then the government controls
 its people and their actions.

25:06.113 --> 25:08.115
- You don't believe
 that, sir, do you?

25:08.158 --> 25:10.160
- Well, just 'cause
 I don't believe it,

25:10.204 --> 25:11.205
it doesn't mean that
 other people don't

25:11.248 --> 25:12.380
feel the same way.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.730
[clicking]

25:27.134 --> 25:30.354
- You know, when
this war's over,

25:30.398 --> 25:32.748
I'm gonna have a group of kids.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.402
I'm gonna line 'em up.

25:34.445 --> 25:37.579
I'm gonna tell 'em
stories about this war.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.625
If they don't shit themselves,

25:39.668 --> 25:41.583
I'm gonna beat
 the shit out them.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.585
[chuckles]

25:43.629 --> 25:46.109
- Now, what the hell, Sergeant?

25:48.155 --> 25:52.202
Damn, you're more fucked
up than the Communists.

25:52.246 --> 25:53.769
- War is hell.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.598
[distant booming]

26:15.312 --> 26:17.401
- Little filthy-ass native.

26:18.620 --> 26:22.624
I know you wanna kill
all my fuckin' brothers.

26:22.668 --> 26:25.148
Probably wanna go home
 to your fuckin' wife,

26:25.192 --> 26:27.629
your ugly-ass wife,
 probably wanna fuck

26:27.673 --> 26:31.677
some goats or some
 shit, whatever the
 fuck you natives do.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.114
What do you even do,
 like, what the fuck?

26:34.157 --> 26:36.638
Are you even worth anything?

26:36.682 --> 26:37.900
Why am I here guarding you?

26:37.944 --> 26:41.121
I should just fuckin'
 kill you right now.

26:43.253 --> 26:44.211
You know what?

26:46.256 --> 26:48.258
I got something for you.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.332
Go ahead.

27:18.375 --> 27:19.594
Get outta here.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.335
I'm fucking done with you.

27:21.378 --> 27:23.511
Get your ass outta here.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.687
Do you not fucking hear me?

27:25.731 --> 27:28.255
Get your punk ass outta here.

27:34.435 --> 27:36.002
- [Sergeant Silva] Hey, Avery.

27:36.045 --> 27:37.351
- Hey.

27:37.394 --> 27:38.526
- Seen you taking
 a lot of pictures,

27:38.569 --> 27:39.658
but I don't see you
 write anything down,

27:39.701 --> 27:41.442
like in a journal or anything.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.139
Is that what you're
 trained to do?

27:43.183 --> 27:45.141
- Yeah, you know, that's
what we're trained to do

27:45.185 --> 27:47.970
back there, but my
 officer in charge

27:48.014 --> 27:49.755
down there just thinks
 they're worthless.

27:49.798 --> 27:52.496
So, he just treats
 'em like shit.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.890
- So, how do you write
your papers or whatever?

27:54.934 --> 27:58.372
- Well, other
 people, they like to,

27:58.415 --> 28:01.418
they add a bunch of
lies and just add shit,

28:01.462 --> 28:03.551
but that's why I take so
many pictures out here

28:03.594 --> 28:06.772
is that when I get
 back, I sit down,

28:06.815 --> 28:09.383
look through all of
 them and write from

28:09.426 --> 28:11.254
the pictures and the
feelings that, you know,

28:11.298 --> 28:13.343
I remember when I
 was taking them.

28:13.387 --> 28:16.129
Write from experience
 and find a theme.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.653
- So, what theme did you
find for this mission?

28:18.697 --> 28:19.480
- Welp.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.352
Since I took this
opportunity to go behind

28:22.396 --> 28:24.877
enemy lines, and you
 know, we're kinda

28:24.920 --> 28:29.142
stranded out here, I'm
 feelin' the will to survive.

28:32.101 --> 28:33.320
- That's funny.

28:33.363 --> 28:37.063
Us stuck out here with
 the will to survive.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.978
Yeah, that's rich.

28:39.021 --> 28:40.327
- Yep.

28:40.370 --> 28:44.505
But you know, mostly why
I came in to, you know,

28:44.548 --> 28:47.377
combat journalism is, back home,

28:48.335 --> 28:50.380
people don't really
 care we're dying.

28:50.424 --> 28:53.775
Boys are dying out
 here every day.

28:53.819 --> 28:54.994
People back home don't, frankly,

28:55.037 --> 28:56.473
they don't just give a shit.

28:56.517 --> 28:57.257
- Yeah.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.389
- I wanna change that.

28:59.433 --> 29:00.521
- Yeah.

29:00.564 --> 29:01.870
- With these stories
 I'll change that.

29:01.914 --> 29:04.351
- Yeah the people back home,

29:05.395 --> 29:06.962
they know what's going on here,

29:07.006 --> 29:09.312
they just choose not to care.

29:12.011 --> 29:12.794
- Yeah.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.798
- You got any chow left?

29:16.842 --> 29:17.625
- Nope.

29:17.668 --> 29:18.757
Nothin' left.

29:20.236 --> 29:22.804
- I got something for ya.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.153
Here ya go.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.372
Eat that like a real soldier.

29:25.415 --> 29:26.808
- Thanks, Sarge.

29:30.203 --> 29:31.073
Jap cheese.

29:39.386 --> 29:40.256
[thudding]

29:40.300 --> 29:41.736
- Go fuckin' dumbass.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.172
Get your ass up.

29:44.565 --> 29:45.348
Go.

29:47.437 --> 29:48.395
Come on.

29:48.438 --> 29:50.266
Get your ass up.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.442
I won't even fuckin' look.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.662
Look, I'm not even looking.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.359
Get your ass up and run.

29:56.403 --> 29:59.754
[tense drumbeat music]

30:37.879 --> 30:39.794
[gunshot booming]

30:39.838 --> 30:41.317
- [Avery] Shit.

30:41.361 --> 30:42.101
- [Sergeant Silva] Mills.

30:42.144 --> 30:43.319
- [Lieutenant] Mills.

30:43.363 --> 30:46.714
[tense drumbeat music]

31:03.426 --> 31:07.648
- [Sergeant Silva] Mills,
 Mills, Mills, Mills, Mills.

31:10.216 --> 31:12.566
[groaning]

31:27.973 --> 31:29.496
Okay, alright?

31:29.539 --> 31:30.976
- [Mills] Don't
 let me die, Sarge.

31:31.019 --> 31:35.023
- [Sergeant Silva] Here,
you'll be fine, you'll be fine.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.372
Fuck.

31:36.416 --> 31:37.460
You'll be fine.

31:43.423 --> 31:44.990
It's his femoral artery.

31:45.033 --> 31:47.906
Pretty sure he's
 not gonna make it.

31:51.083 --> 31:54.347
- We're gonna stay
 the night here.

31:54.390 --> 31:57.872
We'll figure out what
 to do in the morning.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.442
[tense music]

32:11.712 --> 32:13.192
- Hey man.

32:13.235 --> 32:14.628
Remember that time we told Davis

32:14.671 --> 32:17.674
to bring that soda
 out on a mission?

32:18.849 --> 32:20.286
- [Mills] Yeah.

32:20.329 --> 32:23.419
- And he forgot the damn soda.

32:23.463 --> 32:24.681
Yeah, we must have
 called him Soda

32:24.725 --> 32:27.510
for about eight missions then.

32:27.554 --> 32:30.470
[Mills whimpering]

32:30.513 --> 32:34.213
And what about that time
 before Lieutenant Key left us?

32:34.256 --> 32:36.084
We got all the way
 out to his spot

32:36.128 --> 32:38.957
and he told you to
 call something in.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.915
What was you gettin' in?

32:40.959 --> 32:42.743
- All those damn cows.

32:47.443 --> 32:49.010
Then I radioed back.

32:51.012 --> 32:53.710
[somber music]

34:06.740 --> 34:09.090
- Avery, where's the Sergeant?

34:11.440 --> 34:13.442
- He's still down there.

34:58.487 --> 34:59.967
- Hey, Paparazzi, wake up.

35:00.010 --> 35:00.924
- What's up?

35:00.968 --> 35:01.664
- [Sergeant Silva] You hungry?

35:01.708 --> 35:02.578
- Yeah.

35:02.622 --> 35:05.625
- [Sergeant Silva] Follow me.

35:05.668 --> 35:08.671
[crickets chirping]

35:22.250 --> 35:23.033
- [Sergeant Silva]
These guys have gotta be

35:23.077 --> 35:24.687
the perimeter detail.

35:24.731 --> 35:25.775
- [Avery] Yeah.

35:27.603 --> 35:31.303
- Well, there's only
one way we're gonna eat.

35:38.353 --> 35:39.659
- Oh, you know, I
 don't know, man.

35:39.702 --> 35:41.530
- Hey, you can wait
 another night without food

35:41.574 --> 35:43.576
or we can eat right now.

35:51.323 --> 35:53.020
- Yeah, you're right.

35:55.327 --> 35:56.545
Let's do this.

35:58.025 --> 36:01.028
[funky chime music]

37:19.802 --> 37:22.109
- Looks like we get to eat.

37:24.981 --> 37:27.941
Oh, next time you
 hit him in the liver.

37:27.984 --> 37:29.203
He'll go into shock.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.161
It'll be easier for ya.

37:33.468 --> 37:34.991
- Yeah.

37:35.035 --> 37:38.038
[crickets chirping]

37:45.567 --> 37:49.789
[beeping]
 [clicking]

38:40.579 --> 38:41.841
- Alright, wake up soldiers.

38:41.884 --> 38:42.929
Come on.

38:45.235 --> 38:48.543
Come on, rise and shine troops.

38:48.587 --> 38:51.459
Now, why was nobody
 standing guard?

38:54.680 --> 38:56.029
Come on, Sergeant.

38:56.072 --> 38:59.728
Private, we're behind enemy
 lines, not on vacation.

39:00.903 --> 39:03.210
Let's get some more
logs so we can go ahead

39:03.253 --> 39:04.864
and finish this raft and get

39:04.907 --> 39:08.041
the hell outta here
 by tonight, alright?

39:08.084 --> 39:09.999
- [Avery] Yes, sir.

39:10.043 --> 39:11.087
- Damn.

39:29.889 --> 39:33.675
- Hey, Mills would have
want you to have this.

39:35.111 --> 39:36.939
Can I trust you?

39:36.983 --> 39:38.201
You got my back, right?

39:38.245 --> 39:39.942
- Yeah, I won't let you down.

39:39.986 --> 39:41.988
- Alright, let's get
 out there and do this.

39:42.031 --> 39:43.381
- [Avery] Alright.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.997
- [Lieutenant] This is
looking good, gentlemen.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.086
- [Avery] Thank you, sir.

39:53.129 --> 39:54.870
- This should work.

39:56.132 --> 39:59.962
I think this is gonna
 actually get us there.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.965
You should definitely put
 another line down the center.

40:03.009 --> 40:05.620
[tense music]

40:08.101 --> 40:10.233
- Alright, I need to
 find some more logs.

40:10.277 --> 40:11.017
Avery?

40:11.060 --> 40:12.061
- [Avery] Yeah?

40:12.105 --> 40:13.149
- You go that way.

40:13.193 --> 40:14.324
You got Mills'
 weapon, so you should

40:14.368 --> 40:15.543
be able to handle
 yourself, alright?

40:15.587 --> 40:16.414
- Roger.

40:17.632 --> 40:20.200
- I'll hold down the
 raft, maybe I'll tie

40:20.243 --> 40:22.594
a line down the middle.

40:22.637 --> 40:25.031
[tense music]

41:03.983 --> 41:06.551
[wailing music]

42:09.048 --> 42:12.138
[tense clicking music]

42:32.419 --> 42:35.248
[wailing music]

43:02.449 --> 43:05.757
[tense clicking music]

43:19.205 --> 43:21.773
[wailing music]

43:25.777 --> 43:27.953
[scraping]

43:27.996 --> 43:30.608
[water rushing]

43:37.179 --> 43:39.268
- [Avery] Hey, Lieutenant.

43:39.312 --> 43:40.748
- [Lieutenant] What
 are you doing, Avery?

43:40.792 --> 43:43.316
- Just give it a few minutes.

43:44.796 --> 43:48.060
The water from the river
 will help remove the sands.

43:48.103 --> 43:50.149
It'll be good to
 drink after that.

43:50.192 --> 43:51.716
- That's not a good idea.

43:51.759 --> 43:53.761
I mean, we don't know where
 this river's origin is.

43:53.805 --> 43:58.287
We don't know what the
 local illnesses are.

43:58.331 --> 44:00.202
[slurps]

44:01.290 --> 44:03.641
- Ooh, that's good to drink.

44:16.392 --> 44:18.394
- Where the hell did
 you learn to do that?

44:18.438 --> 44:19.961
- My grandpa.

44:20.005 --> 44:23.791
When I was little, we
 used to go camping a lot.

44:25.401 --> 44:27.926
- Close with your
 family then, huh?

44:27.969 --> 44:30.058
- Yeah, you could say so.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.845
A little bit, I mean,
 my parents divorced

44:33.888 --> 44:36.630
when I was young, so
 I constantly grew up

44:36.674 --> 44:39.241
in a different household.

44:39.285 --> 44:42.201
It was just easier
going into the military,

44:42.244 --> 44:44.203
live on my own.

44:44.246 --> 44:48.424
- Sometimes it's best to go
 off and do your own thing.

44:48.468 --> 44:50.992
- What about you, Lieutenant?

44:52.385 --> 44:55.388
- I used to be,
 'til I got divorced.

44:56.389 --> 44:58.391
See, we were in college.

44:59.522 --> 45:01.220
We had a son.

45:01.263 --> 45:05.398
My family still loves her,
 but she cheated on me.

45:05.441 --> 45:06.747
- Sorry to hear that.

45:06.791 --> 45:08.401
That's rough.

45:08.444 --> 45:10.403
- It's alright.

45:10.446 --> 45:12.622
My family is still trying
 to tell me to make it work,

45:12.666 --> 45:14.624
but I knew that if
 she did it once,

45:14.668 --> 45:16.191
she would do it again, right?

45:16.235 --> 45:17.323
- [Avery] Yeah.

45:17.366 --> 45:18.150
- But,

45:19.281 --> 45:20.543
it's okay.

45:20.587 --> 45:22.371
I'm gonna focus on
 my military career.

45:22.415 --> 45:23.721
I'm gonna retire as a colonel.

45:23.764 --> 45:25.287
I'm gonna buy a nice
 house, a nice boat.

45:25.331 --> 45:26.593
- [Avery] Oh, yeah.

45:26.636 --> 45:30.249
- Maybe someday my son
will even love me again.

45:32.164 --> 45:34.427
- Well, you know, Lieutenant,

45:35.471 --> 45:37.430
your son's gonna grow up.

45:37.473 --> 45:38.823
He's gonna mature.

45:40.128 --> 45:41.477
He'll learn to understand that

45:41.521 --> 45:43.958
that was the best
 thing for you to do.

45:44.002 --> 45:45.612
It was for the best.

45:49.355 --> 45:50.617
- What about you?

45:50.660 --> 45:53.054
You got a girlfriend
 back home, Avery?

45:53.098 --> 45:55.361
- Yeah, I got a girlfriend, but,

45:55.404 --> 45:58.059
she's not quite
 back home right now.

45:58.103 --> 45:59.800
- Where is she, then?

45:59.844 --> 46:01.802
- I met her back at
 an operating base

46:01.846 --> 46:03.761
and she's a cook there.

46:04.979 --> 46:06.285
- Oh, man.

46:06.328 --> 46:07.590
You journalists really do know

46:07.634 --> 46:09.157
how to have a fun
 time during wartime.

46:09.201 --> 46:11.377
- [Avery] Hell, yeah.

46:11.420 --> 46:13.466
- Well, don't even
 worry about it.

46:13.509 --> 46:15.120
I'm not gonna tell
 anybody under command

46:15.163 --> 46:16.774
that you're bumping uglies
 with the mess hall chick.

46:16.817 --> 46:19.080
[laughing]

46:20.429 --> 46:21.561
- Thank you.

46:21.604 --> 46:23.868
- No problem, well,

46:23.911 --> 46:25.086
Let's get that raft
built so we can get you

46:25.130 --> 46:27.393
back to that mess hall, huh?

46:27.436 --> 46:29.612
- [Avery] Alright, let's go.

46:30.526 --> 46:33.355
[water rushing]

46:59.207 --> 47:01.166
- Hey, you guys gotta
 come check this out.

47:01.209 --> 47:02.428
- [Lieutenant] What's up?

47:02.471 --> 47:03.603
Avery and I have been
 doing all the work

47:03.646 --> 47:05.387
around here, so this
 better be worth it.

47:05.431 --> 47:07.520
- Okay, well, sir,
 this is time for you

47:07.563 --> 47:10.392
to earn your reward for
 being behind enemy lines.

47:10.436 --> 47:11.263
Come on.

47:11.306 --> 47:12.090
Follow me.

47:38.594 --> 47:39.378
There.

47:55.176 --> 47:56.961
- Good find, Sergeant.

47:58.571 --> 48:00.399
We're definitely
 gonna need to sneak by

48:00.442 --> 48:03.489
those guys under cover of night.

48:03.532 --> 48:05.621
[clicking]

48:15.066 --> 48:16.676
- Sir, check it out.

48:31.125 --> 48:33.954
- That's an enemy general.

48:33.998 --> 48:35.477
- You think so?

48:35.521 --> 48:37.218
- I'm positive.

48:37.262 --> 48:38.698
I remember in the
 mission briefing

48:38.741 --> 48:42.615
seeing that guy wearing that
 hat in one of the photos.

48:43.659 --> 48:45.183
Definitely means we're
 gonna have to pass

48:45.226 --> 48:48.751
by these guys under cover
 of night, regardless.

48:49.796 --> 48:51.406
Alright, let's go.

48:56.368 --> 48:57.673
Take lead, Silva.

49:25.136 --> 49:27.529
[tense music]

49:31.664 --> 49:32.665
- This is probably good.

49:32.708 --> 49:33.448
- Yeah, right here.

49:33.492 --> 49:34.623
Set her down.

49:35.494 --> 49:37.887
[tense music]

50:19.277 --> 50:21.540
[yawning]

50:23.020 --> 50:24.630
- So, yeah, just go
 ahead and alert the enemy

50:24.673 --> 50:27.415
while we're waiting
 to get our way home.

50:27.459 --> 50:31.680
- Yeah, then we'd actually
 have something to do.

50:31.724 --> 50:33.378
- What is that supposed to mean?

50:33.421 --> 50:35.510
- We've just been sittin'
 here this whole time,

50:35.554 --> 50:36.642
this whole fucking deployment.

50:36.685 --> 50:38.426
I've just been sitting here,

50:38.470 --> 50:40.298
off in the distance
calling in air strikes.

50:40.341 --> 50:41.821
I'm sick of it.

50:41.864 --> 50:43.431
- What do you expect us to do?

50:43.475 --> 50:45.607
- We got a general
 over there right now.

50:45.651 --> 50:49.263
We could take him out and
 actually impact this war.

50:49.307 --> 50:50.873
- In the middle of
 enemy territory?

50:50.917 --> 50:52.875
Now, why do you think
 that's a good idea?

50:52.919 --> 50:56.140
- Well sir, we have this
 perfect opportunity right now.

50:56.183 --> 50:58.620
He's just sittin'
 there, waitin' for us.

50:58.664 --> 51:00.013
- You know what?

51:00.057 --> 51:01.667
It wouldn't matter if we
took out their general.

51:01.710 --> 51:03.451
If it were one of our generals,

51:03.495 --> 51:05.149
he would be replaced in a week,

51:05.192 --> 51:07.803
and the fighting would continue.

51:10.415 --> 51:12.025
Am I wrong?

51:12.069 --> 51:14.506
The best thing we
 can do is survive,

51:14.549 --> 51:17.074
so that we can go back,
 train for another mission

51:17.117 --> 51:20.642
and then come back here
and impact the war.

51:20.686 --> 51:24.777
- Sir, why'd you even
join in the first place?

51:24.820 --> 51:26.344
- Oh, I don't see
 why we need to bring

51:26.387 --> 51:28.694
our personal life decisions
 into this conversation.

51:28.737 --> 51:31.436
- Well, I joined to make
a purpose in my life,

51:31.479 --> 51:32.828
to make a difference
 in this world,

51:32.872 --> 51:36.702
and right now, we have
 that perfect opportunity.

51:38.573 --> 51:41.750
- Listen, we're stickin' to
 the plan that I came up with.

51:41.794 --> 51:43.404
We're gonna build this raft.

51:43.448 --> 51:45.580
We're gonna escape by night
 and we're going to get home.

51:45.624 --> 51:49.236
I don't wanna hear you say
 anything else about it.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.759
Where you goin'?

51:50.803 --> 51:52.196
Where you goin'?

51:53.240 --> 51:55.851
[water rushing]

52:15.393 --> 52:16.611
- This is fuckin' bullshit.

52:16.655 --> 52:18.526
Who the fuck does
 he think he is?

52:18.570 --> 52:20.789
I been through 32
 fuckin' missions,

52:20.833 --> 52:21.964
and he thinks he can
 just walk in here

52:22.008 --> 52:24.837
and tell me what the fuck to do?

52:25.794 --> 52:26.752
- Hey look, Silva--

52:26.795 --> 52:28.101
- Shut the fuck up.

52:28.145 --> 52:29.668
- Now, hold on.

52:29.711 --> 52:32.279
That general, well,
 he came in on a boat.

52:32.323 --> 52:33.106
You didn't mention that.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.760
He came on a boat.

52:35.717 --> 52:38.285
We been tryin' to build
this rickety ass raft.

52:38.329 --> 52:40.809
We're not gonna
 float down any river.

52:40.853 --> 52:41.593
We get that boat.

52:41.636 --> 52:43.638
We kill that general.

52:43.682 --> 52:47.033
You get your fame and we're
 able to get out of here.

52:47.076 --> 52:48.817
- That boat was big
enough for all us, huh?

52:48.861 --> 52:50.732
- Had oars, too.

52:50.776 --> 52:52.560
- Fuckin' genius, kid.

52:52.604 --> 52:53.909
Fuckin' genius.

52:54.954 --> 52:55.737
Sir, sir.

52:57.261 --> 52:58.740
We've got a plan.

53:00.786 --> 53:02.396
- [Lieutenant] Oh, no.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.919
Didn't seem like the last
 one was too smart, Silva.

53:03.963 --> 53:05.660
- Yeah well, just hear me out.

53:05.704 --> 53:07.749
This is how we're
 gonna get home.

53:07.793 --> 53:10.665
You may not like it, but,
 it's gonna get us home.

53:10.709 --> 53:11.971
- Alright, let's hear it.

53:12.014 --> 53:15.235
- Alright, so the
 general came in on a boat

53:15.279 --> 53:17.759
big enough for all of
us and all of our gear.

53:17.803 --> 53:22.024
So, we just go over there
 and take his boat from him.

53:23.809 --> 53:24.723
Yeah, it'll be perfect.

53:24.766 --> 53:26.072
Hear me out.

53:26.115 --> 53:27.900
I shimmy across.

53:27.943 --> 53:30.903
I lay down the
 distraction, draw him out.

53:30.946 --> 53:32.339
You guys, you and Avery--

53:32.383 --> 53:33.688
- Hit him from the back.

53:33.732 --> 53:36.387
- Boom, in the tent,
 take whoever's left.

53:36.430 --> 53:40.217
Whatever guys I don't pick
 off, you take care of.

53:40.260 --> 53:41.174
Easy peasy.

53:58.844 --> 53:59.932
- You know, I don't
 think that anybody

53:59.975 --> 54:02.761
is ever ready to fight in a war.

54:02.804 --> 54:06.895
Think we do it instinctively
 in order to survive.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.290
Let's do this, Sergeant.

54:10.334 --> 54:12.379
- It's gonna work, sir.

54:12.423 --> 54:15.861
- The only thing we
have to fear is bullets.

54:15.904 --> 54:18.516
- You know, I think
 Mills would say,

54:18.559 --> 54:21.519
"Let's kill these
 mother fuckers."

54:21.562 --> 54:22.781
- Let's do it.

54:23.869 --> 54:27.002
[tense somber music]

54:40.886 --> 54:43.454
[water rushing]

57:55.863 --> 57:57.996
- Alright, guys.

57:58.039 --> 57:59.693
I'm gonna go set up.

57:59.737 --> 58:03.305
When I start firing,
 that's your cue.

58:03.349 --> 58:04.829
- Alright.

58:04.872 --> 58:06.004
- Good luck, Sergeant.

58:06.047 --> 58:07.353
- Good luck.

58:07.396 --> 58:09.094
Let's do this, Avery.

58:23.238 --> 58:24.892
- Hey, shitheads!

58:24.936 --> 58:28.026
[soft classical music]

59:14.246 --> 59:17.118
[gunshots booming]

59:55.722 --> 59:59.987
[speaking foreign language]

01:00:00.031 --> 01:00:02.816
[gunshot booming]

01:00:08.082 --> 01:00:11.259
[thudding]
 [moaning]

01:00:11.303 --> 01:00:14.088
[classical music]

01:02:16.384 --> 01:02:18.735
- We should get outta here.

01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:21.563
[classical music]

01:02:28.353 --> 01:02:30.398
[clicking]

01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:12.092
[choking]

01:03:17.445 --> 01:03:20.753
[soft classical music]

01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:31.503
[water rushing]

01:03:35.637 --> 01:03:37.030
- [Avery] Silva.

01:03:41.687 --> 01:03:45.473
- [Sergeant Silva] Those
 fuckers didn't have a chance.

01:03:45.517 --> 01:03:49.129
- Private, Sergeant,
 we gotta go, guys.

01:03:49.173 --> 01:03:53.394
With all that racket, enemy's
 bound to be approaching again.

01:03:55.135 --> 01:03:57.572
[splashing]

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:17.201
[tense music]

01:04:17.244 --> 01:04:20.247
Let's get the hell
 outta here, boys.

01:04:23.337 --> 01:04:25.731
[tense music]

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:52.497
[eerie chime music]

01:04:55.935 --> 01:04:59.112
[dramatic gong music]

01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:14.649
[splashing]

01:05:18.436 --> 01:05:20.351
- [Avery] What's wrong?

01:05:25.486 --> 01:05:27.010
- I think we're on
 the wrong river.

01:05:27.053 --> 01:05:28.272
- Wrong river?

01:05:30.665 --> 01:05:34.626
- We went further south
into enemy territory.

01:05:37.672 --> 01:05:39.631
- Shit, Silva's dead.

01:05:41.676 --> 01:05:42.460
- Fuck.

01:05:45.158 --> 01:05:47.769
[water rushing]

01:06:03.872 --> 01:06:07.398
What the hell did
 you do that for?

01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:11.010
- We all know that
 shit's worthless, anyway.

01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:17.234
Sir, where are we going?

01:06:20.802 --> 01:06:22.065
- I don't know.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:35.600
[tense music]

01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:35.529
[somber music]
