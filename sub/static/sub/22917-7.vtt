16:53.179 --> 16:54.514
not for the music.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.891
You know, you asked me
to do the Requiem--

16:56.933 --> 16:59.894
Well, that was my Requiem.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.232
Don't-don't be... m-mad.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.858
Well, okay, be angry at me.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.361
But not... not with Gloria,
not with the orchestra,

17:08.403 --> 17:10.655
not with the building...

17:10.696 --> 17:12.656
or the Youth Orchestra.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.951
I'm not angry.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.162
And WAM isn't dead.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.622
Oh. Th-That's good, that's good.
He's-he's not dead.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.624
WAM:
Hello, Maestro.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.877
Hey.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.880
-I thought you were dead.
-To be precise,

17:26.921 --> 17:28.423
I short-circuited.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.468
I now understand
the dynamics of fragility.

17:31.509 --> 17:34.554
Thanks to you, I truly know
how to finish the Requiem.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.598
FUKUMOTO: Maestro,
I am disappointed in you.

17:36.639 --> 17:40.310
I always thought you were
an out-of-box kind of guy.

17:40.351 --> 17:44.397
The Requiem was beautiful,
but it didn't move us forward.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.609
RODRIGO:
I am an out-of-box

17:47.650 --> 17:49.778
kind of guy, I mean,
like an inside-box...

17:49.819 --> 17:51.863
-GLORIA: Uh, uh, arigato...
-I don't even see the box.

17:51.905 --> 17:56.117
...uh, gozayamishita,
Fukumoto-san.

17:56.159 --> 17:59.579
I look forward
to continuing to discuss

17:59.621 --> 18:02.081
our partnership.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.173
-♪ ♪

18:13.092 --> 18:14.677
Oh...!

18:16.805 --> 18:19.057
-THOMAS: Hello, Jerry.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.017
Aha.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.645
So, you found my little haunt.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.272
Yeah, if Gloria sent you,
I'm not interested.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.566
No, I'm not here from Gloria.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.652
I snuck out.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.821
Well, don't tell Gloria
that Fugu

18:32.862 --> 18:34.864
is seriously rethinking
his donation.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.366
Aw, fuck, no.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.576
But hey, not my pig,
not my farm.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.037
Oh, no. God almighty,
she will be crushed.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.580
Mm-hmm.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.582
On the other hand,

18:44.624 --> 18:47.252
there are other orchestras
in New York.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.297
What are you getting at,
Maestro?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.471
I don't know, this music,
it's, like, an abyss,

18:58.513 --> 19:00.974
and you go through the abyss
and come out on the other side,

19:01.015 --> 19:04.102
and there's just
even more fucking darkness.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.521
Yeah. I just don't know
if I can do that.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.772
Hai Lai?

19:07.814 --> 19:10.233
Hi. Where did you go?

19:10.275 --> 19:12.318
Are you talking to him?

19:14.112 --> 19:16.865
No, I was talking to...
someone else.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.534
-Oh,
that's really good, Hai Lai.

19:19.576 --> 19:22.370
-Just-just keep your... be
in touch with that. -Listen,

19:22.412 --> 19:25.206
for the finals,
they chose Mahler 6.

19:25.248 --> 19:27.083
Mahler 6!

19:27.125 --> 19:29.168
-Oh, my God, you're gonna win.
You're gonna win. -No!

19:29.210 --> 19:31.254
Yes, you're gonna win. Yes.
Yes, I can see it.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.590
I mean, yeah, you're gonna win.
I can see the future.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.466
-Please don't say that.
-Yes, you're gonna win,

19:35.508 --> 19:38.136
and you know what, everything's
beginning now for you.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.179
-You can do anything.
-I really just don't think

19:40.221 --> 19:41.890
that I have a handle on this.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.516
What? But look what you did
with the Berlioz.

19:43.558 --> 19:44.726
You were incredible.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.978
You were so good.
You were just...

19:47.020 --> 19:49.439
completely... magical, you know?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.524
:
I mean, you didn't have a...

19:51.566 --> 19:53.860
a very clear concept
of what you were doing,

19:53.902 --> 19:56.863
but you just... I mean,
you just played the music.

19:56.905 --> 20:00.158
What do you mean that I didn't
have a clear concept about it?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.035
You know what I mean.

20:02.076 --> 20:03.661
I mean, you were just...

20:03.703 --> 20:05.914
you know,
from the instinct coming out.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.665
And I w...
I was listening to you,

20:07.707 --> 20:10.668
and I stopped being your coach,
I was just an audience.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.296
You know? It was music,
there was music happening.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.840
Okay, well, I really need
to ram this Mahler

20:15.882 --> 20:17.425
down their fucking throats,

20:17.467 --> 20:19.177
so if you could be my coach
for a few seconds,

20:19.218 --> 20:21.846
that would be really great.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.473
Just be honest with me.

20:23.514 --> 20:24.974
Complete honesty?

20:25.016 --> 20:26.476
Yeah.

20:26.517 --> 20:27.602
-Go for it.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.228
All right, okay.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.522
Well, all right, at the top,

20:31.564 --> 20:33.191
your hands were
in the right position,

20:33.232 --> 20:34.943
but then you just
got really excited

20:34.984 --> 20:38.196
and you went for it and
the legato was a little bit off.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.906
You know, it didn't sink in.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.491
-Right, okay.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.326
It was a little bit like,
ah, almost there,

20:43.368 --> 20:46.204
but then the problem is
that the fermata,

20:46.245 --> 20:48.206
there was something, that it was
a little bit too short.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.209
So the trumpets, for example,
came in a little bit too late

20:51.250 --> 20:54.420
-and then the oboe, it came in
a little bit too loud. -Yeah.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.214
-And it was...
-Wait, so that's...

20:56.255 --> 20:59.175
-that's the first 20 bars.
-Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.386
Yes, when the flutes,
for example, they come in,

21:01.427 --> 21:03.471
you didn't really show them
how to phrase,

21:03.513 --> 21:04.764
so they didn't know
where to breathe

21:04.806 --> 21:05.765
and that's the problem,
you know?

21:05.807 --> 21:07.016
It happened with
all the winds...

21:07.058 --> 21:08.935
You know, it wasn't
orange or white,

21:08.977 --> 21:11.396
it was just like something there
in the middle...

21:11.437 --> 21:12.814
You know this thing we've
been talking about, you know,

21:12.855 --> 21:14.732
like, not underlining
everything.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.318
These guys, they know
what they're doing, you know?

21:17.360 --> 21:18.945
But just let it play, you know?

21:18.987 --> 21:20.363
Like, listen to them...
I don't know, but next time,

21:20.405 --> 21:22.031
you have to get it
really perfect, Hai Lai,

21:22.073 --> 21:23.700
really, really perfect.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.757
GLORIA:
Oh, Hesby!

21:39.799 --> 21:43.261
How wonderful to hear from you.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.222
Wha... could you just
repeat that?

21:46.264 --> 21:49.517
I-I... the reception here
isn't...

21:49.559 --> 21:52.603
What
When?

21:52.645 --> 21:55.064
What in the name of Mozart

21:55.106 --> 21:57.275
and motorcycles
and everything else

21:57.316 --> 21:59.318
in the damn world
is wrong with you?!

21:59.360 --> 22:01.154
Hello, darling.

22:01.195 --> 22:03.698
What the hell happened
in your childhood

22:03.740 --> 22:05.908
!
-What, darling,

22:05.950 --> 22:07.702
are you talking about?

22:07.744 --> 22:09.370
Still play dumb?

22:09.412 --> 22:11.247
You stay out of this.

22:11.289 --> 22:12.415
I just spoke to Hesby.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.250
He said you met with him

22:14.292 --> 22:16.544
and now he can't decide
who should perform the Asyla.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.796
He said that we should sort
it out amongst ourselves.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.301
How dare you go sneaking around
behind my back?

22:23.342 --> 22:26.054
Me?! Oh, that's the pot
calling the kettle black.

22:26.095 --> 22:27.638
-Oh, please.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.307
You think I'm stupid?

22:29.348 --> 22:33.019
I mean, all the gifts,
the flowers, the love letters.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.854
I mean, all right,
if you're having an affair,

22:34.896 --> 22:38.107
why don't you just say so?

22:38.149 --> 22:41.152
After all, I might want
to step out myself sometime.

22:41.194 --> 22:45.490
I mean, heaven knows monogamy
was never one of my things.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.699
Those aren't love letters.

22:46.741 --> 22:48.242
They're from Daniel Mahajan.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.495
He wants me to come
and run the Guggenheim.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.289
What? Mah... Mah...

22:53.331 --> 22:57.168
that's ridic... you...

22:57.210 --> 22:59.754
Well, why didn't you tell me?

22:59.796 --> 23:02.507
Because, Thomas, I love you,

23:02.548 --> 23:04.550
but you have
a big fucking mouth!

23:04.592 --> 23:08.179
-No.

23:08.221 --> 23:13.351
No, no, because I am going
to get the piece back

23:13.392 --> 23:18.106
and I am going to crush
your amateur borough orchestra.

23:18.147 --> 23:19.315
Fine!

23:19.357 --> 23:21.025
Well, fine!

23:21.067 --> 23:23.194
No, fine.
