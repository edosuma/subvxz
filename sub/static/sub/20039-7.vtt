WEBVTT

00:06.700 --> 00:09.333
(speaking Mandarin...)

00:15.633 --> 00:17.400
Ay-yi-yi-yi.

00:17.467 --> 00:20.000
Wow, that's impressive.
You speak Chinese.

00:20.067 --> 00:21.300
It's Mandarin.

00:21.367 --> 00:22.767
Because that's my factory
in Shanghai.

00:22.833 --> 00:24.500
I mean, it's a bitch because,

00:24.567 --> 00:26.067
used to be fine
with just Cantonese.

00:26.133 --> 00:28.567
Anyway, I just doubled
our grill order.

00:28.633 --> 00:30.967
Oh, my God, double?
We're not even through dinner.

00:31.033 --> 00:32.500
Hope I can sell
all those grills.

00:32.567 --> 00:35.133
Oh, you guys will be able
to sell them, no problem.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.200
You and Hector.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.267
Ah, right.
Right, right, Hector.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.533
The kid has got charisma.
Where did you find him?

00:40.600 --> 00:42.200
Uh, you know, Hector
kind of found me.

00:42.267 --> 00:44.167
Oh, like a cute
little lost puppy.

00:44.233 --> 00:46.000
Yeah, like a puppy
with a rap sheet.

00:46.067 --> 00:47.967
Puppy on parole.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.600
I prefer dogs
that are a little bit older.

00:49.667 --> 00:52.833
You know, they're loyal,
they have incredible character.

00:52.900 --> 00:54.200
When you want them,
they're there.

00:54.267 --> 00:55.867
When you're in bed,
they cuddle up next to you.

00:55.933 --> 00:58.700
Mmm, mmm.
Yes, I do love dogs.

01:00.667 --> 01:02.333
You know, Lori,
I'm not in a hurry,

01:02.400 --> 01:04.067
but I haven't seen a waiter
in hours.

01:04.067 --> 01:06.333
They know I like my privacy.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.633
Oh.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.600
Well, then I'm getting
the bill, okay?

01:09.667 --> 01:12.833
Mmm, there is no bill.
I own the place.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.267
Nice.

01:14.333 --> 01:15.933
All right, next time,
I'm taking you out.

01:16.067 --> 01:17.133
How's Wednesday?

01:17.200 --> 01:18.167
Perfect.
Okay.

01:18.233 --> 01:19.767
Can I pick you up
around 8:00?

01:19.833 --> 01:22.800
No, I don't know where I'm
gonna be, so I'll pick you up.

01:22.867 --> 01:24.067
Okay.

01:24.067 --> 01:26.500
You're so far away
over there.

01:26.567 --> 01:28.533
(patting seat)
I won't hurt.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.633
Are you starting
to trust me?

01:36.700 --> 01:38.700
(clears throat)

01:38.767 --> 01:39.700
I'm getting there.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.700
Good.

01:41.767 --> 01:44.533
**

01:46.767 --> 01:48.067
(laughter)

01:48.133 --> 01:49.400
What a night, huh?

01:49.467 --> 01:50.667
I know.

01:50.733 --> 01:51.667
What did I tell you?

01:51.733 --> 01:53.200
Olly.

01:53.267 --> 01:55.800
Mom made coffee and soup.
You want some?

01:55.867 --> 01:57.533
Yes.
No, wait.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.800
Rachel, we don't have a meeting.
Is everything okay?

01:59.867 --> 02:02.500
Everything is...
great.

02:02.567 --> 02:06.600
And there's great buzz on
Baxter's draft of "Valleys."

02:06.667 --> 02:08.267
Okay, but he hasn't
even turned in yet.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.233
Olly, buzz is buzz.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.367
Yeah.
Buzz is buzz.

02:11.433 --> 02:12.567
I know buzz is buzz.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.100
You don't have to tell me
buzz is buzz.

02:14.167 --> 02:15.367
Bees everywhere.

02:15.433 --> 02:17.800
Ugh, I better get to work.

02:17.867 --> 02:19.567
Yeah, you better.

02:19.633 --> 02:20.567
Oh!

02:23.167 --> 02:25.767
(door shuts)
What was Rachel doing here?

02:25.833 --> 02:27.867
Oh, I met Jason and Rachel
at that showcase

02:27.933 --> 02:30.067
that you wanted me to go to,
but Jason had to go home

02:30.067 --> 02:33.567
to his wife, so me and Rachel
kept the night going.

02:33.633 --> 02:36.833
Girl can da-ance!
She slept over.

02:36.900 --> 02:40.533
Like a slumber party or...

02:40.600 --> 02:41.800
Oh.

02:41.867 --> 02:43.133
You and Rachel.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.967
Wait, are you lesbians?

02:45.067 --> 02:46.633
No. I mean, I don't know
about Rach,

02:46.700 --> 02:49.900
but I'm not into categories and
limits like your generation.

02:49.967 --> 02:51.233
I'm only two years
older than you.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.500
I know, and Rachel
couldn't believe it.

02:53.567 --> 02:54.867
Jason.

02:54.933 --> 02:57.133
I specifically told you
to keep having sex with Jason.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.333
I am.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.867
Jason and Rachel
work together.

03:00.067 --> 03:02.067
Damn it, Pfeiffer,
do not mess this up for me.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.667
I'm not, I didn't know
it was gonna be a problem.

03:04.733 --> 03:06.600
Yeah, because you never think
anything is a problem.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.867
Fine.
I'll stop seeing Rachel.

03:08.933 --> 03:10.600
Yes!
Or no, don't.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.567
Don't break up with her, 'cause
then she's gonna be upset.

03:12.633 --> 03:13.933
And she's gonna cry at work
and Jason's gonna be like,

03:14.067 --> 03:15.267
why are you crying at work?

03:15.333 --> 03:16.533
And then everything's
gonna go sideways. Just--

03:16.600 --> 03:18.633
Could you just keep
everyone happy?

03:18.700 --> 03:19.467
Yes, sir.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.333
Don't ever do that to me.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.900
That's a thing I do.
This is mine.

03:22.967 --> 03:24.333
Hey!

03:24.400 --> 03:27.533
And stop asking if you're
gonna use this in real life.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.833
(bell rings)
Mm-hmm.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.200
Now, get, get!

03:30.267 --> 03:31.800
Get on up out of here.

03:31.867 --> 03:33.700
Oh, not you,
Manolo the cholo.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.800
Yes, Miss Wendy?

03:35.867 --> 03:38.867
I enjoyed watching you rap up
there on stage the other night.

03:38.933 --> 03:40.300
You looked real cute.

03:40.367 --> 03:41.833
Thanks.

03:41.900 --> 03:44.200
No one's ever called me cute
before, except one time in jail.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.133
I had to break his nose
with a cafeteria tray.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.633
Oh, well,
he had that coming.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.467
I noticed your grades
have been slipping, though.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.133
Is everything
all right at home?

03:51.200 --> 03:53.300
Yeah, I got no excuse.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.133
The work
is just getting tougher.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.267
Or maybe I'm just dumb.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.500
Manolo, you are not dumb.

03:58.567 --> 04:00.833
What a stupid thing to say.

04:00.900 --> 04:04.467
I need to find a way
to get through to you.

04:04.533 --> 04:07.233
I think you need a little...

04:07.300 --> 04:09.667
one-on-one attention.

04:09.733 --> 04:12.300
What do you say you
come over to my condo,

04:12.367 --> 04:15.667
maybe Thursday, 8:00?

04:15.733 --> 04:17.333
Thanks, Miss Wendy,
that would be great.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.367
I'm gonna send you
my address,

04:19.433 --> 04:20.900
but I won't be using
my school account,

04:20.967 --> 04:23.067
I'll be using
my Hotmail account.

04:23.133 --> 04:24.967
You got two e-mails?

04:25.067 --> 04:26.200
Damn, you're successful.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.467
(giggles)

04:29.567 --> 04:32.467
Damn, George.
This grill gets it done.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.300
I will give it a six hollas.

04:34.367 --> 04:35.467
Six hollas?
What's that?

04:35.533 --> 04:36.633
I'm blowing up so big,

04:36.700 --> 04:38.400
Olly got me a gig
at Holla.

04:38.467 --> 04:39.733
It's like Yelp,
but even better.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.900
It's got six stars
instead of five.

04:41.967 --> 04:44.800
Oh, that's one better.
That's a game-changer.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.700
Yo, G, check this out.

04:46.767 --> 04:49.400
This picture of Coco
and your writer is on TMZ.

04:49.467 --> 04:51.067
Oh, yeah, look at that.
Wait a minute,

04:51.067 --> 04:53.133
but there's no mention
of "Valleys" or anything, huh?

04:53.200 --> 04:54.433
Nah.
Damn.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.067
So check this out.
Lori gave me an app

04:56.100 --> 04:58.967
that tracks the real-time sales
of the George Lopez Grill.

04:59.067 --> 05:00.733
Damn!
Yeah.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.467
And you know, she wants me
to do a show next--

05:02.533 --> 05:04.667
next week if you wanna...

05:04.733 --> 05:06.067
You wanna do it with me,
if you got--

05:06.133 --> 05:07.800
(clears throat)
you know, it's a good time.

05:07.867 --> 05:08.767
Seriously?

05:08.833 --> 05:10.267
Thanks, George.
Wait, hold up.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.933
Is this, like, a job?

05:12.067 --> 05:13.800
Yeah, it's kind of like a job,
Hector, but here's the thing.

05:13.867 --> 05:16.100
It's very important, okay,
because we are professionals

05:16.167 --> 05:18.300
that you have no fraternizing

05:18.367 --> 05:20.667
with any of the ladies
at GBN, okay?

05:20.733 --> 05:23.667
Because it's important to
stay professional with, like,

05:23.733 --> 05:26.133
anybody in shipping or anybody
at the top, you know,

05:26.200 --> 05:27.400
like the boss,
like Lori, you know.

05:27.467 --> 05:29.733
Uh-huh. But what
about you and Lori?

05:29.800 --> 05:31.700
Sounds like y'all had
quite a little celebration.

05:31.767 --> 05:34.167
Okay, listen, we're colleagues.
We're equals, okay?

05:34.233 --> 05:35.733
So we spend time together.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.133
That's fine,
you understand, Hector?

05:37.200 --> 05:38.333
Uh... no.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.533
Okay, so if Lori
and I date, that's cool,

05:41.600 --> 05:43.933
but I think if you
get involved with her,

05:44.067 --> 05:45.467
I think it's a violation
of your parole.

05:45.533 --> 05:47.067
Wha...
And the penal code.

05:47.067 --> 05:49.067
You know what? I'm gonna
go look that up right now.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.067
It's in the high 800s.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.967
Ah, George.
Great news.

05:55.067 --> 05:56.833
I booked you a college gig.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.733
I thought
I couldn't do standup.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.467
That's the best part.
Technically, this isn't standup.

06:01.533 --> 06:03.300
I booked you through
the Latino Student Union

06:03.367 --> 06:04.633
as a guest lecturer.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.367
Oh, my God, that's great,
Olly, thanks.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.933
Right? The theme
is Latinos in new media.

06:09.067 --> 06:11.267
This is exactly what you need
to make yourself more relevant.

06:11.333 --> 06:14.367
You, doing your thing in a room
full of young, hip millennials.

06:14.433 --> 06:16.633
It's perfect.
What school is it?

06:16.700 --> 06:18.433
You're gonna like this part.
San Fernando Valley University.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.067
Oh, that's a school
in the old neighborhood.

06:20.067 --> 06:21.133
Oh, you--

06:21.200 --> 06:22.400
You think they'll
give me, like,

06:22.467 --> 06:23.800
an honorary degree
or something?

06:23.867 --> 06:24.933
I can ask.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.367
Ask if they give me
a doctorate,

06:26.433 --> 06:28.233
if it includes being able
to write prescriptions.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.433
George.

06:33.733 --> 06:35.067
Hey.
Great to see you.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.233
I've been looking forward
to this all day.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.367
Oh, me too.

06:38.433 --> 06:39.767
Had the most stressful day
at work.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.133
Some activists in Guangdong

06:41.200 --> 06:43.733
are trying to knock it down
to a 14-hour workday.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.100
How dare they?
(laughs)

06:45.167 --> 06:46.800
Don't piss 'em off,
'cause the world

06:46.867 --> 06:48.233
is running out
of ethnicities to exploit.

06:48.300 --> 06:49.700
Well, I hope you're hungry

06:49.767 --> 06:52.567
because there is this great
new Basque place downtown.

06:52.633 --> 06:54.367
Oh, nice. I'm picking up
the check this time, okay?

06:54.433 --> 06:55.667
You don't own
this place, do you?

06:55.733 --> 06:58.233
No, not yet,
but I really can't wait

06:58.300 --> 06:59.867
to see if the changurro
is any good.

07:00.067 --> 07:01.567
I've never actually
bought a restaurant

07:01.633 --> 07:04.200
without tasting the, uh...
Changurro.

07:04.267 --> 07:05.333
(cell phone ringing)

07:05.400 --> 07:07.300
Pardon me for one second.
Sure.

07:07.367 --> 07:08.733
Mr. Wu?

07:08.800 --> 07:11.267
Yeah, it's so nice
to hear from you.

07:11.333 --> 07:14.100
(speaking Mandarin...)

07:17.933 --> 07:18.867
How how.

07:18.933 --> 07:19.667
How how.

07:19.733 --> 07:20.733
Oh, good question.

07:20.800 --> 07:21.933
Let me check my notes.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.133
You coming out?
Yeah.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.767
Okay, oh, all right.

07:24.833 --> 07:27.567
(whispering)
One second.
Okay, sure.

07:27.633 --> 07:29.467
Oh, okay,
let me get that.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.133
Okay.
Thank you.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.133
You in?

07:33.433 --> 07:35.200
Yeah.

07:35.267 --> 07:37.700
(speaking Mandarin...)

07:40.100 --> 07:42.200
Hey, George,
this is gonna take a while.

07:42.267 --> 07:43.967
Do you mind driving?
Uh, no.

07:44.067 --> 07:45.167
Let me just run
and get my keys.

07:45.233 --> 07:47.467
No, no, no, this, right here.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.100
All right.

07:49.167 --> 07:50.500
Yeah.

07:52.067 --> 07:53.133
Oh, and take the 2.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.467
There's never any traffic.

07:54.533 --> 07:56.300
Oh, okay.

07:56.367 --> 07:58.233
(speaking Mandarin)

07:58.300 --> 07:59.567
Is the temperature good?

08:05.233 --> 08:07.133
(Manolo)
So jefe, how did
your date with Lori go?

08:07.200 --> 08:08.633
(George)
Beautiful.
Let me tell you something.

08:08.700 --> 08:11.067
Lori knows what she wants.
A less confident guy

08:11.133 --> 08:13.600
might be intimidated,
but not me, I'm secure.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.767
Totally secure.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.200
Hey, you can tell
I'm secure, huh?

08:16.267 --> 08:17.667
Very secure.

08:17.733 --> 08:19.300
You see, Manolo, that's why
I like you, you get me, man.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.967
Ooh, there is already a lot
of chatter about your lecture.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.500
Yes, I've noticed an increase
in hate tweets from racists.

08:24.567 --> 08:26.767
And an increase in grill sales.

08:26.833 --> 08:28.233
I wonder if there's
a relationship there.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.800
Oh, and they agreed
about your honorary degree.

08:30.867 --> 08:32.133
It's gonna be in arts
and letters.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.633
Oh, man, arts and letters,
I like that.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.267
Hey, Manolo, look at us, man.

08:36.333 --> 08:39.167
You with a high school diploma
and me with a university degree.

08:39.233 --> 08:41.467
When we get 'em, we should
drive up and down Glen Oaks

08:41.533 --> 08:43.733
with our cap and gown,
honking the horn.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.533
You know, this place
would be good, too,

08:45.600 --> 08:47.200
for like, a storyline
for "Valleys."

08:47.267 --> 08:48.467
Hmm.
You know, college.

08:48.533 --> 08:50.600
Drugs and sex.

08:50.667 --> 08:51.733
I wonder if they
have a lacrosse team.

08:51.800 --> 08:52.833
(man)
Build the wall!

08:52.900 --> 08:54.433
(crowd chanting)
Build the wall!

08:54.500 --> 08:56.700
Build the wall!
Build the wall!

08:56.767 --> 09:00.467
Hey, assholes.
Still no wall?

09:00.533 --> 09:02.433
What are you
waiting for, permits?

09:02.500 --> 09:03.633
Ha ha!

09:07.267 --> 09:08.333
Hey.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.400
Hi, George!
We are so happy to have you.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.767
I'm Stephanie, head of the CCLL
Student Outreach Committee.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.800
This is Bjorn Swetbrot.

09:15.867 --> 09:18.200
Bjorn Swetbrot?
Are you Mexican?

09:18.267 --> 09:21.100
Argentine. My parents moved
there from Norway in the '80s

09:21.167 --> 09:23.467
and had me
and then moved to L.A.

09:23.533 --> 09:24.967
I guess you could say
I'm a dreamer,

09:25.067 --> 09:28.700
except that I'm fully documented
and I'm a U.S. citizen.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.067
Yeah, you don't have
to apologize.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.767
But it never hurts.
I'm the head

09:31.833 --> 09:33.800
of the Chicano-slash-Chicana-
slash-Latino-

09:33.867 --> 09:35.733
slash-Latina
student movement.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.800
Right. Wow.
Well, congratulations.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.567
For saying all that,
I got something for you,

09:39.633 --> 09:43.300
I got one of my new George Lopez
grills, one for each of you.

09:43.367 --> 09:45.167
Oh!
So, you ready?

09:45.233 --> 09:46.833
Listo.

09:46.900 --> 09:49.267
That means ready.

09:49.333 --> 09:50.367
Right this way.

09:53.900 --> 09:56.500
Hey, did you see
the protestors out there?

09:56.567 --> 09:58.933
Yeah, but don't worry.
They aren't allowed on campus.

09:59.067 --> 10:00.500
They have to stay
behind the sidewalk.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.633
We're trying to do
the same thing

10:01.700 --> 10:02.833
with the Young
Republicans.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.333
No, invite 'em in,
I can take it.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.333
Mix it up a little, put 'em
in their place, and who knows?

10:06.400 --> 10:07.800
Maybe if I make 'em laugh,

10:07.867 --> 10:09.300
we might be able
to change their mind.

10:09.367 --> 10:11.567
I have heard them say
the most offensive things.

10:11.633 --> 10:13.000
They don't believe
in safe speech.

10:13.067 --> 10:15.000
Come on, man.
Sticks and stones.

10:15.067 --> 10:16.333
We used tear gas on them.

10:17.833 --> 10:21.267
(rhythmic clapping)
Oh.
It's showtime!

10:24.933 --> 10:27.267
It is my pleasure
to introduce a pioneer

10:27.333 --> 10:30.067
of racial and gender
egalitization

10:30.133 --> 10:32.733
and one of the great Latin
ex-performers of our time,

10:32.800 --> 10:34.733
George Lopez!

10:34.800 --> 10:36.867
(applause)

10:39.667 --> 10:41.067
Muchisimas gracias.

10:41.133 --> 10:44.633
And I wanna say,
how are ze doing tonight?

10:44.700 --> 10:45.933
(laughter)

10:46.000 --> 10:50.167
That is a non-gender biased
pronoun.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.567
Thank you very much.

10:51.633 --> 10:53.400
Yeah, listen, I'm honored
to be on your campus.

10:53.467 --> 10:56.600
The last time I was here,
the cops were called pigs

10:56.667 --> 11:00.467
and I was being busted
for holding a lid.

11:00.533 --> 11:03.767
That's when weed was called pot
and you had to get it

11:03.833 --> 11:05.867
from your cousin,
the shiftless weed dealer,

11:05.933 --> 11:10.667
and now you get it from
your cousin, the weed doctor.

11:10.733 --> 11:11.967
Weed rules!

11:12.067 --> 11:13.867
You know,
I'm still kind of adjusting

11:13.933 --> 11:15.733
to Donald Trump being president,
I gotta tell you.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.200
(booing)
Right?

11:17.267 --> 11:19.867
I'm not saying that he's
our first fascist president.

11:19.933 --> 11:21.433
Wait a minute,
I think I am saying

11:21.500 --> 11:25.067
that he's our first
fascist president, huh?

11:26.567 --> 11:29.300
That's right. Donald Trump
has a problem with immigrants,

11:29.367 --> 11:32.367
I say, stop marrying 'em.
Let me tell you something.

11:32.433 --> 11:34.300
I don't know what problem
Donald Trump has with Mexicans.

11:34.367 --> 11:35.567
He sucks!

11:35.633 --> 11:37.433
That's right, he sucks.
He don't like Mexicans.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.233
Let me tell you something.
Donald Trump is Mexican.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.533
He's got all the signs.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.133
He's got kids
from three different women.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.567
(gasping)

11:45.633 --> 11:47.800
He don't pay his taxes.
Boo!

11:47.867 --> 11:51.300
And he's not taking a salary
for being president.

11:51.367 --> 11:53.467
Only a Mexican could take a job
from a black guy

11:53.533 --> 11:55.533
and do it for less money.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.767
(booing)

11:56.833 --> 11:58.133
Hey, come on,
I'm making fun of Trump.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.200
These are jokes.
Racism isn't funny!

12:00.267 --> 12:02.167
Maybe not in your hands.
That's why you leave it

12:02.233 --> 12:04.067
to a professional.
What are you doing?
Cut his mic, Lance.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.967
Listen, go back
and stand over there

12:06.067 --> 12:08.733
in the dark where you were.
Lance, you touch that mic,

12:08.800 --> 12:10.767
I'll unscrew your fist
and I'll throw it

12:10.833 --> 12:12.867
on the top of this (bleep)
auditorium.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.200
Listen, you guys.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.900
Are you really afraid
of hearing words?

12:15.967 --> 12:17.700
I'm talking about freedom
of speech here.

12:17.767 --> 12:19.067
(booing)

12:19.067 --> 12:21.100
You guys are booing
freedom of speech?

12:21.167 --> 12:22.967
It's the number-one
constitutional right

12:23.067 --> 12:25.167
that you have.
That's why it's number one,

12:25.233 --> 12:27.100
it's the most important,
and number two

12:27.167 --> 12:28.667
is the right to bear arms.

12:28.733 --> 12:30.533
(booing intensifies)
Make him stop!

12:30.600 --> 12:33.867
Listen. You should be able
to hear anybody say anything.

12:33.933 --> 12:35.500
If I wanted to say
that I thought Donald Trump

12:35.567 --> 12:38.700
has made America great and
he belongs on Mount Rushmore,

12:38.767 --> 12:42.867
I hope that you would think
that that was a joke, all right?

12:46.100 --> 12:47.600
Come on.
So what--

12:47.667 --> 12:49.167
What, now you're gonna just
leave? You know what?

12:49.233 --> 12:51.300
You're a bunch
of useless pussies.

12:51.367 --> 12:52.567
Entitled pussies.

12:52.633 --> 12:54.667
Let me give you a tip
into your future.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.433
Pull up to the next window,
please.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.867
I still want my degree.

12:57.933 --> 12:59.400
Where's that girl
with the green t-shirt?

12:59.467 --> 13:01.067
Hey, green girl, I see you.

13:01.067 --> 13:02.500
I still want that degree.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.533
I just lost it.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.667
I didn't even notice.

13:08.733 --> 13:09.900
They booed
the Constitution!

13:09.967 --> 13:11.333
And not laughing
at your jokes.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.933
That too. Hey, we gotta
get you some contacts.

13:13.067 --> 13:14.667
I can't wear them.
My eyes are too dry.

13:14.733 --> 13:16.733
Hello.
Wow, that was fast.

13:16.800 --> 13:17.733
What?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.733
Uh, nothing.
Just the tweets.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.367
And the Instagrams, wow.
So what now?

13:21.433 --> 13:23.333
College kids hate me
as much as racists do?

13:23.400 --> 13:25.100
No. You know what?
It's no big deal.

13:25.167 --> 13:26.600
Nobody pays attention
to college kids anyway,

13:26.667 --> 13:28.567
'cause they're always protesting
things like Halloween

13:28.633 --> 13:31.133
and the national anthem and
they're all on Adderall anyway.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.567
What about building up
my relevance

13:32.633 --> 13:34.900
with a younger,
hipper audience?

13:34.967 --> 13:37.067
Let's circle back on that.

13:46.333 --> 13:47.267
Hmm.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.933
I think we got a case.

13:55.133 --> 13:58.867
So the denominator is five.
That would make "X" 12?

13:58.933 --> 14:00.500
That's very good, Manolo.

14:00.567 --> 14:03.333
You are really starting
to learn algebra.

14:03.400 --> 14:07.167
Thanks. But what I really want
to learn about is Wendy's bra.

14:07.233 --> 14:09.867
Manolo, what makes you think
you can talk to me that way?

14:09.933 --> 14:11.300
Sorry, I just assumed

14:11.367 --> 14:14.467
because your hand was
creeping up my thigh.

14:14.533 --> 14:15.767
Oh, so it is.

14:15.833 --> 14:18.467
This damn thing
has got a mind of its own.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.533
Wait, wait, wait.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.633
Now, we have to keep
this relationship a secret.

14:23.700 --> 14:24.733
We have a relationship?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.067
Do you want a relationship?

14:26.067 --> 14:27.867
Hell, yeah.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.333
Okay, good, well,
get on over here, then.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.867
Wait.
George says not to.

14:32.933 --> 14:34.700
What?
Who the hell is George?

14:34.767 --> 14:36.067
George Lopez, my boss.

14:36.100 --> 14:40.500
Oh. Well, it is against
school district policy

14:40.567 --> 14:42.333
for me to be dating you,

14:42.400 --> 14:44.867
but that's why we have
to keep it a secret.

14:44.933 --> 14:46.900
Sort of makes it exciting,
doesn't it?

14:46.967 --> 14:48.100
Yeah.

14:49.567 --> 14:51.667
Have you done this
with a student before?

14:51.733 --> 14:52.900
No.

14:59.867 --> 15:02.300
Oh, you know what you want?
Hi.

15:02.367 --> 15:05.567
I'll have an order
of tacos al pastor

15:05.633 --> 15:07.933
and an order
of beef tamales.

15:08.067 --> 15:09.600
Mm-hmm.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.933
Why don't you go to Taco Bell
with the rest of the gringos?

15:12.067 --> 15:14.900
(man)
Or get some kale!
Gringos love kale.

15:14.967 --> 15:17.067
Yeah, why don't you
go eat some kale?

15:17.100 --> 15:18.900
What are you talking about?

15:22.233 --> 15:24.200
"Latinos for Trump?"

15:24.267 --> 15:25.667
What?

15:27.300 --> 15:29.200
My God, Latinos for Trump,
there's no such thing.

15:29.267 --> 15:31.667
Oh, it gets worse.
A white supremacist group

15:31.733 --> 15:34.833
posted the picture and has
been retweeting it constantly.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.400
Their social media presence
is really impressive.

15:37.467 --> 15:38.767
I can't believe this.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.667
Like, I didn't peg you for
a white nationalist, George,

15:40.733 --> 15:44.133
but that can explain why you
always get testy with me.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.500
Well, at least they're saying
some very nice things

15:46.567 --> 15:48.467
about you and there's
a lot of likes,

15:48.533 --> 15:49.900
and you can't say
this isn't relevant.

15:49.967 --> 15:52.067
Are you crazy?
It's bad relevant.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.667
It's very bad relevant,
yeah.

15:53.733 --> 15:55.067
I've gotten a lot of calls
from the network

15:55.067 --> 15:56.900
that I'm not returning.
You see?

15:56.967 --> 15:58.567
This is gonna screw up
"Valleys" for me.

15:58.633 --> 15:59.733
Oh, shoot.
What now?

15:59.800 --> 16:01.567
Ah! The President
of the United States

16:01.633 --> 16:03.067
just weighed in on this.

16:03.067 --> 16:05.967
"George Lopez is one of
the good ones, fantastic."

16:06.067 --> 16:07.600
Son of a bitch!

16:07.667 --> 16:10.300
This is great news, jefe.
Maybe now you can stay.

16:16.067 --> 16:17.700
Man. Of all the white people
to support me,

16:17.767 --> 16:19.067
why couldn't it be, like,

16:19.067 --> 16:20.533
the United States
Tennis Association?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.100
Why's it gotta be
white supremacists?

16:22.167 --> 16:23.133
I could get some of the guys
from the old gang

16:23.200 --> 16:24.567
to give them a beatdown.

16:24.633 --> 16:26.767
Nope, I think that's
a clear parole violation.

16:26.833 --> 16:28.233
Yeah, that's right.
That--

16:28.300 --> 16:30.400
It is a violation.
So, listen.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.500
We don't want to hurt any
hatemongers, all right?

16:32.567 --> 16:34.067
If some of your friends
just happen to find out

16:34.133 --> 16:35.967
where those dudes are
and want to take matters

16:36.067 --> 16:37.800
into their own hands,
allegedly,

16:37.867 --> 16:41.133
I don't want you involved
or a thousand feet

16:41.200 --> 16:42.433
from something
that's not happening.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.467
I think I got it.
Oh, and jefe,

16:44.533 --> 16:46.133
I was gonna go over
to Wendy's and study,

16:46.200 --> 16:47.700
if it's okay with you.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.133
Yeah, man, of course, Manolo,
you can study all night.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.200
So you're not
disappointed with me

16:50.267 --> 16:51.400
for making honey with money?

16:51.467 --> 16:53.933
Come on, big sexy!
Hell, no, man.

16:54.067 --> 16:55.433
It's your time now,
all right.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.167
And there's a lot
of gray areas in that now.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.300
Oh, like you and Lori?

16:58.367 --> 16:59.767
Yeah, like me and Lori.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.167
I don't even know
where I stand with Lori, man,

17:01.233 --> 17:02.533
it's hard to tell with her.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.900
But we're going out tonight
so I gotta...

17:03.967 --> 17:05.333
(phone alert)
What's this?

17:05.400 --> 17:06.800
From Olly.
The network is trying

17:06.867 --> 17:08.767
to track me down
to discuss the situation.

17:08.833 --> 17:11.067
Don't answer my phone.
Now I can't answer my phone!

17:11.067 --> 17:14.267
If you're going out with Lori,
do you want Hector to drive you?

17:14.333 --> 17:16.633
No, she's gonna pick me up.
She's picking you up again?

17:16.700 --> 17:18.567
That don't sound like
my macho friend George Lopez.

17:18.633 --> 17:20.067
No.
Doesn't sound like me,

17:20.100 --> 17:21.600
but you know what?
The way things are going

17:21.667 --> 17:23.533
right now, I just need
a little sunshine on me, man.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.267
Let somebody else make sure
everything's all right.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.167
If the phone rings,
don't answer it.

17:33.233 --> 17:35.067
I'm avoiding the network.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.867
Not a problem.
I don't answer anyway.

17:36.933 --> 17:38.267
Why are you avoiding me?

17:38.333 --> 17:39.500
I'm not avoiding you.

17:39.567 --> 17:41.267
Yes, you are.
I just heard you say it.

17:41.333 --> 17:44.800
And by the way,
this thing with George is bad.

17:44.867 --> 17:48.533
Well, if expanding your demo
is bad, then, yeah, it's bad.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.867
Disaffected angry white people
could bring in a 40 share.

17:51.933 --> 17:54.700
Sure.
If we got all of them,

17:54.767 --> 17:56.567
but a lot will still be
watching "Blue Bloods."

17:56.633 --> 17:58.267
And we might have trouble
holding them for a second week

17:58.333 --> 18:00.400
when they find out George
isn't really a racist.

18:00.467 --> 18:03.567
True. But, what if they
come for the hate

18:03.633 --> 18:06.867
and stay for the quality
programming? Hey!

18:06.933 --> 18:08.533
I'm starving.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.400
Worked up quite an appetite
last night.

18:10.467 --> 18:11.700
Oh.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.933
Hey, you're here already?

18:20.067 --> 18:22.067
I'm walking out the door.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.533
(Hector)
Ryan Seacrest loves it.

18:23.600 --> 18:28.067
(Lori)
I know, he does, doesn't he?

18:28.100 --> 18:29.667
(clears throat)
Hey.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.067
Hey, George.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.433
What's up? No loitering,
vato, move along, eh?

18:33.500 --> 18:35.400
Okay.
I'll see you Monday.
Bye.

18:35.467 --> 18:37.133
Monday? What, are we
doing a show Monday?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.967
Hector is, we're
trying some things out.

18:39.067 --> 18:40.500
So come on, George,
let's get going.

18:40.567 --> 18:42.467
What are we gonna do, go to that
restaurant with the privacy?

18:42.533 --> 18:44.400
I want to take you
someplace else first.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.733
Is this, like, one of
those underground nightclubs

18:53.800 --> 18:56.433
that I've heard so much about?
Or do you own this place?

18:56.500 --> 18:58.267
'Cause I heard of a place
called The Vault. Is that it?

18:58.333 --> 18:59.733
I want to show you
something.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.800
Okay.

19:03.067 --> 19:04.433
Thank you.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.167
Wow.

19:06.233 --> 19:09.600
This place is more private,
even, than that restaurant.

19:09.667 --> 19:13.600
No one can hear me scream.
Not that I... scream.

19:17.733 --> 19:19.600
Do you know
what you're holding?

19:19.667 --> 19:22.833
"Hey, hey, hey."
The Grill Cosby.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.967
This warehouse is filled
with Grill Cosbys

19:26.067 --> 19:28.600
that I cannot do
anything with.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.833
So all those allegations
of, you know, abuse?

19:32.900 --> 19:37.300
Alleged. I'm a comedian,
so I gotta kinda stay neutral.

19:37.367 --> 19:39.500
One controversy
can kill a product.

19:39.567 --> 19:42.333
I have 50,000
George Lopez grills

19:42.400 --> 19:44.067
on a fast boat from China

19:44.133 --> 19:46.900
and I am not filling up
another warehouse.

19:46.967 --> 19:50.100
George, I teamed with you
to expand my Latino market,

19:50.167 --> 19:53.667
not to shut it down.
I like you.

19:55.233 --> 19:56.767
Fix this.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.000
How?

20:05.067 --> 20:06.767
**

20:09.900 --> 20:11.500
* Unh, yeah, yeah *

20:11.567 --> 20:14.333
* That's right, come on,
come on, come on *

20:14.400 --> 20:16.933
* Unh, yeah, yeah *

20:17.000 --> 20:18.733
* Come on, come on *

20:18.800 --> 20:20.333
**

20:26.933 --> 20:28.967
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:29.033 --> 20:31.300
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:31.367 --> 20:33.733
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:33.800 --> 20:35.400
**
