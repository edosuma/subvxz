WEBVTT

00:40.087 --> 00:41.645
You're falling behind.

00:48.295 --> 00:49.353
Wuphf. Com.

00:49.429 --> 00:51.397
Ryan, we're doing a dance...
This is how you
build a business.

00:51.465 --> 00:52.454
KELLY: We're doing a dance.

00:52.532 --> 00:54.090
RYAN: This is how you
make it in this country.

01:16.390 --> 01:17.755
Find out...
You got Creed.

01:17.824 --> 01:18.848
You jump in front of them.

01:18.925 --> 01:21.450
You make it so hard
to love you sometimes.

01:21.528 --> 01:22.790
Still behind.

01:22.863 --> 01:23.887
I'll take these.

01:23.964 --> 01:26.330
I said I didn't want
to be on the Internet!

01:26.433 --> 01:27.957
Go, go, go, go!

01:42.048 --> 01:43.276
ALL: Streamers!

01:50.123 --> 01:51.112
Dwight!

01:51.191 --> 01:52.488
Dwight, you got
to be kidding me!

01:52.559 --> 01:54.049
Are you crazy?

02:15.382 --> 02:17.179
Toby, how did we do?

02:17.250 --> 02:19.218
TOBY: Well, that was better.

02:19.286 --> 02:21.811
We did it! Yes!

03:01.728 --> 03:04.959
MICHAEL: I <i>suppose summer</i>
<i>had to end sometime.</i>

03:05.031 --> 03:08.467
<i>It's sad, though,</i>
<i>because</i> I <i>had</i>
<i>a great summer.</i>

03:08.535 --> 03:11.299
I <i>got West Nile virus.</i>
<i>Lost a ton of weight.</i>

03:11.371 --> 03:13.339
<i>Then</i> I <i>went back</i>
<i>to the lake.</i>

03:13.406 --> 03:16.842
I stepped on
a piece of glass
in the parking lot,

03:16.910 --> 03:18.002
which hurt.

03:18.078 --> 03:21.013
That got infected,
even though I peed on it.

03:22.182 --> 03:23.672
Saw <i>Inception.</i>

03:25.252 --> 03:27.345
Or at least
I dreamt I did.

03:28.488 --> 03:30.820
Broccoli Rob,
obviously, will be there.

03:30.891 --> 03:31.880
Yes, of course.

03:31.958 --> 03:34.222
And J.C.
We call him Blorville,

03:34.294 --> 03:36.762
because he looks
like a black
Orville Redenbacher.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.889
Who's the guy who
invented the peanut?

03:38.965 --> 03:40.125
Hey, guys.
Hey!

03:40.200 --> 03:41.758
Hi. Hi.

03:41.835 --> 03:42.859
Sorry, didn't mean
to interrupt.

03:42.936 --> 03:43.925
Not at all.

03:44.204 --> 03:46.798
I'm gonna head
back to Siberia there.

03:51.177 --> 03:53.805
I started dating
Erin this summer.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.179
It has been,
in a word, exquisite.

03:57.751 --> 03:59.218
Gabe is awesome.

03:59.286 --> 04:04.815
He has accomplished
so much career-wise
and height-wise.

04:04.891 --> 04:06.290
Thank God he's my boss

04:06.359 --> 04:08.156
because I would
not have said yes

04:08.228 --> 04:10.196
to a first date if
I didn't have to.

04:10.263 --> 04:13.027
But, it's been great.

04:13.099 --> 04:16.329
Am I angry that Gabe
stole my girlfriend
over the summer?

04:16.403 --> 04:17.767
No.

04:17.837 --> 04:20.930
I've been through
anger management, okay?

04:21.007 --> 04:24.966
So right now I am
sitting on a nice beach
at Cape Cod,

04:25.045 --> 04:27.377
gazing out across
the whitecaps.

04:28.682 --> 04:31.879
Oh, look,
it's a humpback whale.

04:31.952 --> 04:33.317
How pretty.

04:34.621 --> 04:36.248
He's eating Gabe.

04:41.595 --> 04:42.619
Hey.

04:43.496 --> 04:44.588
What are you doing?

04:44.664 --> 04:46.791
From now on,
if you're hot,
sit on an ice pack.

04:46.866 --> 04:48.299
Well, what if
you're cold?

04:48.568 --> 04:51.662
Like you'd
ever be cold, Kevin.

04:51.738 --> 04:53.535
Stop asking me
hypothetical questions.

04:53.607 --> 04:54.869
I'm too busy.

04:54.941 --> 04:56.101
Hey, Dwight,
I don't know
if you heard,

04:56.176 --> 04:58.201
but we're supposed
to be drinking out
of weird backpacks

04:58.278 --> 05:00.542
instead of cups,
like regular people.
Oh, you did hear.

05:01.815 --> 05:03.942
Jim, you have one job to do
and you do it forgettably.

05:04.017 --> 05:06.747
Those of us who are busy
require hands-free hydration.

05:06.820 --> 05:09.550
Dwight Schrute,
star salesman,
beet farmer.

05:09.623 --> 05:12.888
Bed and breakfast proprietor.
Aspiring freelance bodyguard.

05:12.959 --> 05:15.689
Add to that list,
owner of this building.

05:17.297 --> 05:19.265
Then burn the list.

05:21.101 --> 05:25.037
This summer I did
the Minority Executive
Training program at Yale.

05:25.105 --> 05:26.538
You guys, I'm, like,
really smart now.

05:26.606 --> 05:28.403
You don't even know.
You could ask me,

05:28.475 --> 05:30.409
"Kelly, what's the
biggest company
in the world?"

05:30.477 --> 05:32.502
And I'd be, like,
"Blah, blah, blah,

05:32.579 --> 05:34.137
"blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,"

05:34.214 --> 05:36.648
giving you the exact
right answer.

05:36.916 --> 05:38.213
Coffee monkey's arrived.

05:38.752 --> 05:40.811
I thought the coffee
was supposed to be
here at 9:00.

05:41.354 --> 05:43.015
Here you go, Big O.

05:45.158 --> 05:46.386
Tiny.

05:47.894 --> 05:49.486
Darryl Hanah.

05:51.197 --> 05:53.688
This says "decaf."
You got me decaf?

05:54.200 --> 05:58.603
Ooh, yeah.
Must have been some
sort of mix-up there.

06:00.340 --> 06:03.639
You cool to just drink it,
or should I drive
all the way back?

06:07.781 --> 06:11.774
Well, summer,
I blew out my knee
playing softball.

06:11.851 --> 06:14.342
Ended up watching
CNN most of the time.

06:14.421 --> 06:16.389
I don't know
how we're gonna get
out of Afghanistan.

06:16.456 --> 06:18.481
I hate the new assistant.

06:18.558 --> 06:21.049
He's only been
here for a week
and I hate him.

06:21.127 --> 06:24.119
The new guy sucks.
Calls me "The Nard man."

06:24.197 --> 06:27.291
I'm the "Nard dog," okay?
Nard man is my father.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.661
My name is Luke Cooper.

06:29.736 --> 06:31.601
I love cinema.

06:31.671 --> 06:35.072
My favorite
movies are <i>Citizen Kane</i>
and <i>The Boondock Saints.</i>

06:35.141 --> 06:39.202
That kid is the worst.
Needs to be fired, Michael.

06:39.279 --> 06:42.009
He's not the worst. Okay?
He's not the worst.

06:42.082 --> 06:43.106
You know who's
the worst?

06:43.316 --> 06:45.409
That intern we had
a few years ago.
That guy.

06:45.485 --> 06:47.043
Remember?

06:47.120 --> 06:48.849
That face,
how ugly he was?

06:48.922 --> 06:51.482
He was the worst.
Good worker, though.

06:51.558 --> 06:52.547
Mmm!

06:53.727 --> 06:54.716
It's not cappuccino.

06:54.794 --> 06:55.783
He messed yours up, too.

06:55.862 --> 06:57.056
He's got to go, Mike.

06:57.130 --> 06:58.654
It's just coffee, guys.

06:58.732 --> 07:00.757
But, yeah,
I'll look into it, okay?

07:04.104 --> 07:05.298
Wow, that's a lot of keys.

07:06.139 --> 07:07.868
The bigger the key chain,
the more powerful the man.

07:07.941 --> 07:09.875
That's right.
The janitor said that.

07:09.943 --> 07:11.205
By the way,
the raccoons are back.

07:11.277 --> 07:12.266
Where?

07:12.679 --> 07:15.512
I think they run
through these panels
and then down under the map.

07:15.582 --> 07:17.709
I wouldn't know for
sure 'cause I don't
have a trained ear.

07:17.784 --> 07:18.876
That's why I have
to use one of these.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.283
Give me that.
Yep.

07:22.355 --> 07:24.186
Wait. And this.

07:24.524 --> 07:26.492
Yes.
Go get 'em.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.250
What happened to
me this summer?

07:28.328 --> 07:29.386
Dwight bought
the building,

07:29.462 --> 07:33.421
so, actually, this has
been the busiest
summer of my life.

07:46.746 --> 07:49.214
Hey, what's so
funny over here?

07:50.250 --> 07:53.276
Ha! Very nice.
Give me my keys.

07:58.958 --> 08:00.687
Ha! Ha!

08:00.760 --> 08:03.194
Not funny, Jim!

08:05.899 --> 08:06.923
Sorry.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.024
Oh, no.
Don't worry about it.

08:08.101 --> 08:11.036
I was just gonna
put a couple keys on
every day until Christmas.

08:11.104 --> 08:13.095
Then his pants
would have fallen down,

08:13.173 --> 08:14.265
which was a little
gift to me, but...

08:14.541 --> 08:15.769
It was really funny.

08:15.975 --> 08:16.999
Well, it would
have been.

08:18.444 --> 08:20.776
So unprofessional,
Mrs. Halpert.

08:22.282 --> 08:23.647
I love you.

08:24.918 --> 08:26.715
Thanks.

08:26.786 --> 08:27.810
Luke.

08:28.555 --> 08:29.647
Luke!

08:30.590 --> 08:31.614
What's up, Venus?

08:31.891 --> 08:34.792
Did you send those
samples to Justin
at Lehigh Motors yesterday?

08:34.861 --> 08:36.192
Because he didn't get them.

08:36.261 --> 08:39.595
Uh, if you
asked me to do it,
I'm sure I did it.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.561
Yeah, strawberries
are ripe.

08:42.669 --> 08:43.727
MEREDITH: Hey.

08:43.803 --> 08:46.397
Turn off the Chumbawamba
and scram, twerp.

08:46.472 --> 08:48.235
All right.
You don't have to yell.

08:48.308 --> 08:49.673
Okay, rude.

08:50.910 --> 08:52.002
Luke,

08:52.478 --> 08:55.106
I want you to go to
the supermarket for me.

08:55.381 --> 08:56.439
What for?

08:56.516 --> 08:58.416
To get some ice cream
for everybody.

08:58.484 --> 09:01.385
It's national
ice cream afternoon.

09:01.454 --> 09:03.354
Great.

09:03.423 --> 09:05.948
And another thing
I did this summer,

09:07.260 --> 09:08.921
I hired my nephew.

09:11.798 --> 09:14.062
Having Luke here
is a pretty big
deal for me.

09:14.133 --> 09:16.101
Because his mother,

09:16.169 --> 09:19.161
who also happens
to be my half sister,

09:19.239 --> 09:22.902
kind of cut me off from
that side of the family
<i>15</i> years ago...

09:22.976 --> 09:25.001
Fourteen.

09:25.078 --> 09:29.242
The last time I saw Luke
was the opening day
of <i>Ace Ventura</i> II,

09:29.315 --> 09:30.509
and that was <i>'95.</i>

09:30.583 --> 09:33.279
So, yes,
<i>15</i> years on the dot.

09:36.322 --> 09:38.790
Anyway, I lost
him in a forest.

09:39.158 --> 09:40.921
"Don't bother Luke."

09:41.194 --> 09:43.094
Why is there a circle
with a line through it?

09:43.329 --> 09:44.557
That means don't.

09:44.631 --> 09:46.030
Haven't you seen
<i>Ghost Busters,</i> Pam?

09:46.299 --> 09:48.927
Yeah,
but it's like you're saying
we should bother Luke.

09:49.168 --> 09:50.931
No, it...

09:51.738 --> 09:55.003
Yes, okay. Right.
All right, yep. My bad.

09:55.074 --> 09:56.473
I got it.

09:57.477 --> 09:58.739
Here we go.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.171
Don't don't bother Luke.
Got it.

10:03.683 --> 10:05.913
Come on. Okay.

10:10.723 --> 10:12.588
That's as clear
as I can make it.

10:12.759 --> 10:14.659
Hey, why can't
we bother Luke?
He deserves it.

10:14.727 --> 10:16.319
Because I don't
want it getting
back to Sabre

10:16.396 --> 10:17.556
that we're yelling
at assistants.

10:17.630 --> 10:19.097
I think it would
reflect poorly on us.

10:19.165 --> 10:20.996
Who's gonna tell
on us? Gabe?

10:22.468 --> 10:23.867
That'd be hilarious.

10:23.937 --> 10:26.997
"Jo, they're creating
a hostile work environment.
Stop them."

10:27.073 --> 10:28.097
Nope, it won't be Gabe.

10:28.174 --> 10:30.074
But, actually, there is
somebody in the office

10:30.143 --> 10:31.542
who is very,
very close to Luke.

10:31.945 --> 10:32.934
How close?

10:33.012 --> 10:34.274
Well, Dwight,
he wiped his butt.

10:34.347 --> 10:35.507
Is that close
enough for you?

10:36.983 --> 10:38.507
Yes. Of course.

10:38.584 --> 10:41.417
Guys, I think Michael
and Luke are related.

10:41.487 --> 10:42.613
No.

10:42.689 --> 10:44.281
No, Toby. He's not.

10:45.825 --> 10:47.315
Yes, he is.
He's my nephew.

10:47.994 --> 10:49.325
What?
What?

10:49.629 --> 10:50.891
Luke is my nephew.

10:50.964 --> 10:52.056
OSCAR: Michael,
that's nepotism.

10:52.198 --> 10:54.257
Luke is getting
special treatment
because he's your nephew.

10:54.334 --> 10:57.360
Yes, exactly.
That is a very nice way
of putting it, Oscar.

10:57.870 --> 11:01.271
Mixing family and business
is a beautiful thing.

11:01.374 --> 11:03.103
What's wrong with
a level playing field?

11:03.176 --> 11:05.838
Do you think
they should have
had open auditions

11:05.912 --> 11:07.106
for the band Hanson?

11:07.413 --> 11:09.938
What if no one
named Hanson showed up?

11:10.016 --> 11:11.415
That wouldn't
even make sense.

11:11.484 --> 11:15.978
Or what if they just
hired the littlest kid
and a 50- year-old guy

11:17.090 --> 11:18.284
who was a murderer?

11:19.459 --> 11:20.483
Really safe.

11:20.793 --> 11:23.023
Oh, man, so many
points being made.

11:23.463 --> 11:25.021
CREED: I <i>couldn't care</i>
<i>less about nepotism.</i>

11:25.398 --> 11:27.457
But I'm loving the debate.

11:27.533 --> 11:29.694
Great minds battling it out.

11:29.769 --> 11:31.703
And I've got
a front row seat.

11:32.005 --> 11:35.065
God, when he needed
help on earth,
who did he hire?

11:35.141 --> 11:36.472
Jesus Christ, his son.

11:36.642 --> 11:37.836
That's a really
tight argument.

11:37.910 --> 11:39.036
MICHAEL: Thank you.
Yeah.

11:39.112 --> 11:41.740
But you're
comparing you and Luke
to God and Jesus.

11:41.848 --> 11:42.906
No. No.

11:42.982 --> 11:45.712
I'm just saying,
why does God get to do
something that I don't?

11:46.085 --> 11:47.382
This is hypothetical.

11:47.453 --> 11:49.421
We're talking about Luke,
who happens to be terrible.

11:49.489 --> 11:52.287
Well, then, why aren't
you bugging me to fire
everybody who's bad?

11:52.358 --> 11:55.122
You just want me
to fire Luke.
That's reverse nepotism.

11:55.461 --> 11:58.328
He should not be
punished because
he is related to me

11:58.398 --> 11:59.797
and bad at what he does!

11:59.966 --> 12:01.991
I would just like
to say something
off of what Darryl said

12:02.068 --> 12:03.467
about the level
playing field.

12:03.536 --> 12:05.868
That is actually
a zoning issue.

12:09.342 --> 12:10.741
So, thank you.

12:12.211 --> 12:13.838
If there's nothing
wrong with this, Michael,

12:13.913 --> 12:15.210
why have you been
keeping it a secret?

12:15.281 --> 12:19.684
Because I wanted you
to come to me and say,
"Wow, he is so great."

12:19.752 --> 12:22.152
And I was gonna say,
"Well, it's in the genes."

12:22.255 --> 12:24.655
And I was actually
gonna be wearing jeans.

12:24.724 --> 12:25.816
And I'd point
to them, right?

12:25.892 --> 12:27.120
No. 'Cause you ruined it.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.653
So, thank you very much.

12:29.729 --> 12:32.197
Here he comes.
Guys, look.

12:32.265 --> 12:36.031
I don't want you to
treat him like anyone
else in the office.

12:36.102 --> 12:38.297
I just want you
to treat him
like my nephew.

12:38.371 --> 12:40.032
Hey, there he is.
ERIN: Hey!

12:40.106 --> 12:41.573
There he is!
Ice cream afternoon!

12:43.543 --> 12:44.942
Wait.

12:45.011 --> 12:48.344
Soy ice cream?
Did you get
real ice cream?

12:48.414 --> 12:49.676
Or enough
for everyone?

12:50.049 --> 12:52.711
No, man.
There was no list.

12:52.785 --> 12:53.979
But I got bagel chips.

12:54.053 --> 12:56.317
Oh, my favorite part of
an ice cream party.
The bagel chips.

12:57.323 --> 12:58.847
Clutch cream run, bro.

13:03.029 --> 13:04.621
Get whatever you want.
On me.

13:05.031 --> 13:07.295
You really think you
can make it up to me
with food?

13:07.366 --> 13:09.095
I don't know.
That usually works.

13:09.168 --> 13:12.194
I feel horrible for
blowing Jim's prank.

13:12.271 --> 13:15.035
I don't know
if you can tell,
but he's mildly upset.

13:15.108 --> 13:16.541
And Dwight hasn't
been messed with
in a while,

13:16.609 --> 13:18.873
so he's become a monster.

13:18.945 --> 13:20.435
I need to
make this right.

13:29.322 --> 13:31.586
I came down here to
feed the feral cats
like I usually do,

13:31.691 --> 13:34.125
and I found something
unsavory in the back
of your nephew's car.

13:34.193 --> 13:37.526
Okay, you know what?
Just... Just back off.
Back off!

13:37.597 --> 13:40.430
Well, take a look.
It's all the packages
he was supposed to overnight.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.991
He never bothered
to send them.

13:43.069 --> 13:46.163
All right,
those might be his.

13:46.239 --> 13:47.570
He might own
an eBay Store.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.733
Yep. That's exactly
what my first thought was.

13:49.809 --> 13:51.208
And then I remembered
having a conversation
with him

13:51.277 --> 13:53.142
where he was like,
"I don't own an eBay Store."
So...

13:53.246 --> 13:55.271
Okay, okay.
You know what?
This is disgusting.

13:55.348 --> 13:56.781
This is like
a witch hunt.

13:56.849 --> 13:58.714
This is like
<i>The Blair Witch</i>
<i>Hunt Project.</i>

13:58.784 --> 14:00.513
I'm sure those are
the expense reports

14:00.586 --> 14:02.178
that corporate was
waiting for yesterday.

14:02.255 --> 14:04.450
They are not.
Let's just make this
kid open his damn car.

14:04.524 --> 14:06.515
Oh, my gosh, those are
the pants you wanted
to return to Talbots.

14:06.592 --> 14:08.856
I'm reconsidering
sending them back
anyway.

14:08.961 --> 14:11.191
You get that kid
to open this car,

14:11.364 --> 14:13.662
or I'm gonna
do it myself

14:13.733 --> 14:15.030
by calling AAA.

14:15.101 --> 14:16.534
Wait a minute.
I'm in.

14:16.802 --> 14:18.565
Don't... All right.

14:18.638 --> 14:20.435
Well, okay.

14:20.506 --> 14:22.440
You've just
committed a felony.

14:22.508 --> 14:23.634
Yep, here they are.

14:23.809 --> 14:26.972
Yep, I just lost a client
'cause I swore I sent
these samples on time.

14:27.046 --> 14:28.172
This kid's costing
us sales, Michael.

14:30.283 --> 14:32.148
I'm sorry,
do you want to try
them on again to see...

14:32.251 --> 14:35.186
No, I know they fit.
It's not about the fit.

14:38.558 --> 14:39.991
<i>Why is this my problem,</i>
<i>Michael?</i>

14:40.059 --> 14:41.549
Because Gabe tattled.

14:41.627 --> 14:44.289
I was perfectly happy
to just hide it from you.

14:44.363 --> 14:46.058
GABE: Those overnight
packages needed
to go out,

14:46.132 --> 14:48.066
and Michael refuses
to hold the guilty
party accountable.

14:48.267 --> 14:49.666
<i>Lower yourself, Gabe.</i>

14:49.735 --> 14:52.260
I <i>don't wanna be</i>
<i>having a conversation</i>
<i>with your crotch.</i>

14:54.907 --> 14:57.307
<i>Okay, now educate me</i>
<i>why you won't fire the boy.</i>

14:57.777 --> 14:58.937
You don't have
all the facts.

14:59.111 --> 15:01.011
<i>Which are?</i>
I love him.

15:01.881 --> 15:05.112
<i>Oh, God.</i>
<i>How far has it gone?</i>

15:06.419 --> 15:08.887
No. No. He's my nephew.

15:09.155 --> 15:11.817
<i>Well,</i> I <i>got a nephew, too,</i>
<i>but he don't work for me.</i>

15:11.891 --> 15:14.485
<i>You know why?</i>
<i>'Cause he's a screw-up.</i>

15:14.560 --> 15:17.028
<i>He can swim in my pool,</i>
<i>but he can't come in my house.</i>

15:17.163 --> 15:21.031
Well, this office is my pool
and my house is my house,

15:21.100 --> 15:24.263
and I just want
my nephew to work
in my pool.

15:24.337 --> 15:27.397
<i>If you keep him, Michael,</i>
<i>I'm gonna hold you</i>
<i>accountable for him.</i>

15:27.640 --> 15:29.733
<i>You're on the hook for</i>
<i>this kid. You got that?</i>
Mmm-hmm.

15:30.009 --> 15:31.636
<i>Cover his ass</i>
<i>like tighty-whiteys.</i>

15:31.711 --> 15:34.839
I will cover his ass
like moss on
a Mississippi tree stump.

15:35.414 --> 15:37.143
<i>Was how</i> I <i>put it</i>
<i>not clear enough?</i>

15:37.216 --> 15:39.241
I <i>mean, you had</i>
<i>to go and make up</i>
<i>your own saying?</i>

15:39.352 --> 15:40.341
Okay.

15:40.419 --> 15:41.477
<i>Deal with it, boys.</i>

15:42.989 --> 15:48.791
Luke and I have been
working side by side
as master and commander.

15:48.861 --> 15:50.658
<i>Me as master,</i>
<i>he as commander.</i>

15:50.730 --> 15:52.595
<i>Occasionally,</i>
<i>he'll need a little push.</i>

15:52.665 --> 15:57.159
<i>And</i> I <i>will do that,</i>
<i>and he'll slow down,</i>
<i>and then</i> I'll <i>push him again.</i>

15:57.236 --> 15:59.204
<i>That's the thing with kids.</i>
<i>You have to keep pushing.</i>

15:59.272 --> 16:01.638
<i>You have to push them</i>
<i>until they push you back,</i>

16:01.707 --> 16:02.901
<i>and then you</i>
<i>push some more.</i>

16:02.975 --> 16:06.911
<i>It's</i> all <i>about give</i>
<i>and take, but mostly it's</i>
<i>about pushing each other.</i>

16:08.014 --> 16:09.606
Oh, yeah.

16:09.682 --> 16:11.081
This will be easy.

16:11.150 --> 16:13.482
So just, like, rearrange
the buttons and stuff.

16:13.686 --> 16:16.587
Yeah, yeah.
Like when he presses
"door close," the doors open.

16:16.656 --> 16:18.248
Or he presses "lobby,"
it goes to third floor.

16:18.324 --> 16:19.621
Stuff like that.
Can you do that?

16:19.725 --> 16:22.717
Yeah. Let me
take a look at
the circus board.

16:23.162 --> 16:26.222
Dwight is about
to get so Pammed.

16:26.966 --> 16:29.059
Hey, did you
SMSItext message me?

16:29.135 --> 16:31.569
Yeah, I wanted to
show you something
in the lobby. Come on.

16:37.710 --> 16:41.237
Okay, that's weird.
I was just hitting
"door close." What?

16:41.514 --> 16:43.038
There we go.
Well...

16:43.115 --> 16:44.104
Good.

16:44.183 --> 16:45.514
Is this elevator
going up?
Hmm?

16:46.385 --> 16:48.876
Hey, the elevator
is disobeying us!

16:51.090 --> 16:54.719
Okay. Okay.
We are stuck.
We are stuck.

16:55.061 --> 16:57.552
Hank! Hank!
Can you hear us?

16:57.630 --> 16:59.257
Oh, my God. Okay.
Emergency protocol.

16:59.332 --> 17:01.459
Okay, just...
Just... Just calm down.

17:01.534 --> 17:04.435
Pam, try and pry open
those front doors,
immediately.

17:04.502 --> 17:07.165
I don't...
Use your talons!
Pry 'em open!

17:07.239 --> 17:09.173
Okay, Dwight...
Oh, my God!

17:09.241 --> 17:10.333
Well, don't look, freak!

17:10.409 --> 17:12.172
Dwight, what are you doing?
Well...

17:12.310 --> 17:14.211
We've only been in here
for, like, two seconds.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.180
I got <i>56</i> ounces of
fluid in my bladder!

17:16.248 --> 17:18.239
And we have
to establish
a pee corner.

17:18.317 --> 17:20.478
You've got to
be kidding me.

17:20.920 --> 17:24.651
Luke is going to
use his laser pointer
to point to account setup.

17:24.723 --> 17:28.090
You click on that first,
then a whole new...
Not... No, no, no.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.787
Luke, come on. Come on.

17:29.862 --> 17:31.727
Not on Oscar's head.

17:31.797 --> 17:33.788
All right.
Luke, come on.

17:33.999 --> 17:34.988
Stop it.

17:35.067 --> 17:36.227
What? I'm stopping it.
That's what you said.

17:36.535 --> 17:38.628
Give me the pointer.

17:38.704 --> 17:39.830
So you just
want me to move it.

17:39.905 --> 17:40.997
You're being
totally unclear here.

17:41.073 --> 17:43.064
I'm just gonna go
ahead and move it.
No, just power it down.

17:43.142 --> 17:45.508
No, no, no, no, no.
Not on Angela's boob.
Come on. Come on.

17:45.678 --> 17:46.804
Luke, seriously.

17:46.879 --> 17:49.074
All right, fine, fine.
I'll just go.
Okay.

17:49.148 --> 17:51.981
I'm gone.
All right. Okay.

17:52.051 --> 17:53.109
Good job.

17:53.285 --> 17:54.547
Okay, email accounts.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.349
So, we're starting
with account setup.

17:56.422 --> 17:58.856
Oh, my God,
is it in my eyeball?
Yes.

17:58.924 --> 18:00.016
I think he's
burning my eye.

18:00.159 --> 18:01.387
ANGELA: Michael,
do something.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.121
Sack up, man.
KELLY: You have
to stop this.

18:03.229 --> 18:04.287
Luke, can I have that?
No.

18:04.363 --> 18:07.491
Okay, I am going to
count down from five.

18:07.566 --> 18:08.624
Five.
Five.

18:08.701 --> 18:09.690
Four.
Four.

18:09.769 --> 18:11.236
I'm not kidding.

18:11.337 --> 18:12.395
Three.
Three.

18:12.471 --> 18:13.529
Two.
Two.

18:13.606 --> 18:15.164
One. Give... Okay.

18:15.241 --> 18:17.038
All right, give it up.
No!

18:17.109 --> 18:20.601
You are going
to learn to be more
professional, Luke!

18:20.713 --> 18:21.702
LUKE: What the...

18:21.781 --> 18:24.375
That's what you're
going to do, Luke!

18:24.450 --> 18:25.678
What the hell was that?

18:25.751 --> 18:27.548
I had to do that.

18:29.388 --> 18:30.685
this!

18:31.023 --> 18:32.820
Screw it!
All right.
Are we good?

18:35.361 --> 18:37.352
You're okay.

18:37.430 --> 18:38.761
He's okay.

18:41.767 --> 18:45.726
There are many different
schools of thought
on capital punishment.

18:45.805 --> 18:47.568
That was awesome.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.871
Texas justice.

18:49.942 --> 18:51.773
Yeah, your nephew
is so lame.

18:51.844 --> 18:54.870
He's been trashing us
relentlessly on Twitter.

18:54.947 --> 18:57.381
Yeah, it's funny
stuff, but mean.

18:57.450 --> 18:59.441
You follow him
on Twitter?

18:59.518 --> 19:02.248
Everywhere I look,
it's Betty White this
and Betty White that.

19:02.321 --> 19:05.188
Finally,
a kid who's not talking
about Betty White.

19:05.257 --> 19:06.656
Of course I follow him.

19:06.959 --> 19:10.224
Michael, you just
physically assaulted
an employee.

19:10.296 --> 19:11.558
Can we talk in private?

19:12.398 --> 19:15.390
Yes, of course.
What is this
in reference to?

19:18.571 --> 19:19.663
Pam?

19:19.738 --> 19:21.000
PAM: Oh, hey, Jim.

19:21.073 --> 19:24.770
Some prankster
switched the elevator
buttons on Dwight.

19:24.844 --> 19:25.868
I did not do this.

19:25.945 --> 19:26.934
I know.

19:30.683 --> 19:34.016
Yeah, and it was going
really great at first.
I got video.

19:35.354 --> 19:36.412
This is impressive.

19:36.889 --> 19:38.288
Well, you know,
they don't call me

19:38.357 --> 19:39.881
"The Bart Simpson of
Scranton" for nothing.

19:40.292 --> 19:42.658
Do they call you that?
They do call me that.

19:42.995 --> 19:44.394
Come on, give me your hand.
I'll help you down.

19:44.630 --> 19:46.791
Nope. Scared of
getting cut in half.

19:46.866 --> 19:47.924
Also, there's
pee on the floor.

19:48.267 --> 19:49.291
Oh.

19:49.368 --> 19:52.064
Of course there is.
Hey, Chinese tonight?

19:52.471 --> 19:53.836
Yeah.
All right.

19:55.140 --> 19:56.903
How you doing?
Pretty good.

19:57.510 --> 19:58.670
You must be
almost out of water.

19:59.211 --> 20:02.510
Stop drinking
the water! Stop!

20:06.952 --> 20:08.943
ANDY: No, no, no, no.
It's the other hand,
right hand.

20:09.021 --> 20:10.010
Right hand?
Yeah.

20:10.089 --> 20:11.784
MICHAEL: <i>Would have</i>
<i>been nice to work</i>
<i>with my family.</i>

20:11.857 --> 20:15.657
<i>It would have been nice</i>
<i>if Luke had been</i>
<i>able to stay here.</i>

20:15.728 --> 20:16.990
<i>But he couldn't.</i>

20:17.062 --> 20:19.360
<i>These things</i>
<i>seldom work out.</i>

20:19.431 --> 20:21.899
I <i>don't know how</i>
<i>Ringling Brothers do it.</i>

20:21.967 --> 20:24.765
<i>Night after night,</i>
<i>town after town,</i>
<i>all across America.</i>

20:24.870 --> 20:26.963
<i>You would think</i>
<i>they'd be sick of</i>
<i>each other by now,</i>

20:27.039 --> 20:30.065
<i>but, clearly,</i>
<i>they make it work.</i>

20:30.142 --> 20:31.439
<i>And my hat's off to them.</i>

20:34.547 --> 20:35.605
Hey! Whoa!

20:35.681 --> 20:37.012
You...
Hey.

20:37.082 --> 20:38.743
Dwight.
Dwight...

20:40.185 --> 20:41.311
Stop!

20:42.621 --> 20:45.021
Legal says the best
way to protect us
from a lawsuit

20:45.090 --> 20:47.456
is to call this
a stress induced
outburst.

20:47.893 --> 20:48.882
Mmm-hmm.

20:49.461 --> 20:51.861
You will have to
undergo six sessions
of counseling.

20:52.231 --> 20:53.858
That's it? Really?

20:55.100 --> 20:57.295
That's nothing.
All right.

20:57.369 --> 20:59.269
That's highway
robbery. Good.

20:59.338 --> 21:00.999
Well, that's the spirit.
I can do that.

21:01.073 --> 21:02.870
And you will do your
counseling right here

21:02.942 --> 21:05.342
because our HR staff
are all certified
counselors.

21:05.411 --> 21:08.039
Okay. Wait, what?

21:09.181 --> 21:12.116
Yeah, I'm really looking
forward to working
with you, Michael.

21:14.086 --> 21:15.110
Is there another option?

21:17.156 --> 21:18.714
The alternative
is termination.

21:24.930 --> 21:26.158
Michael?
