00:01.806 --> 00:03.886
The Governor would like
to put you on a retainer.

00:03.887 --> 00:06.060
- Some problems, you need...
- A fixer?

00:06.061 --> 00:07.818
Let's tell the world
that we're together.

00:07.819 --> 00:09.820
- You think so?
- What's stopping us?

00:09.821 --> 00:12.122
Your past... there's
still something there.

00:12.123 --> 00:13.723
We got a good thing going.

00:13.724 --> 00:15.359
Yeah.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.227
I want to be with you.

00:17.228 --> 00:19.529
How about this? I'll wait.

00:19.530 --> 00:21.831
It's only Adderall. They sell
it in school like Skittles.

00:21.832 --> 00:24.207
- Are you dealing?
- My dad was Shorepound Gang.

00:24.208 --> 00:25.435
It's who I am.

00:25.436 --> 00:28.670
Who you are right now is just dumb.

01:12.349 --> 01:15.484
Hey. Wish me a happy birthday.

01:33.936 --> 01:35.970
Whoa! Lights!

01:42.211 --> 01:43.878
It's a new moon tonight,

01:43.879 --> 01:46.347
so there won't be any night
surfing after the party

01:46.348 --> 01:48.483
without those bright lights.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.118
Well, I gotta give you credit,

01:50.119 --> 01:53.854
turning up to your
party in a stolen vehicle

01:53.855 --> 01:57.291
with a law-enforcement
officer in attendance.

01:57.292 --> 01:59.460
Make that two.

01:59.461 --> 02:02.463
And then I'll be asking
him to drive it home

02:02.464 --> 02:04.065
at the end of the night.

02:04.066 --> 02:07.201

Okay. Speech. I hate speeches.

03:31.918 --> 03:33.176
All right.

03:33.177 --> 03:36.347
When I came back to the
Reef a few months ago,

03:36.348 --> 03:40.292
I was not sure that I had
made the right decision,

03:40.293 --> 03:46.464
and standing here, looking
at all of your faces...

03:46.465 --> 03:48.667
Well, I'm still not sure that
I made the right decision.

03:48.668 --> 03:51.369
But whatever.

03:51.370 --> 03:55.841
If I can say just one thing
to everyone here tonight...

03:55.842 --> 03:57.209
it would be...

04:00.278 --> 04:02.346
... I think I'm gonna throw up.

04:02.347 --> 04:04.916
That's my girl!

04:04.917 --> 04:07.017
Shut up, Otter.

04:07.845 --> 04:10.088
This mean there's not
gonna be any night surfing?

04:10.089 --> 04:11.487
Really?

04:18.863 --> 04:20.331
You okay?

04:22.367 --> 04:24.568
That's got to be like 10, right?

04:24.569 --> 04:27.138
More like, uh, 12, but,
hey, who's counting?

04:27.139 --> 04:28.239
Me.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.108
Come on, have a sip.

04:30.109 --> 04:32.143
Okay.

04:32.144 --> 04:34.178
I don't feel good at all.

04:34.179 --> 04:35.578
Yeah.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.285
Oh, God.

04:41.286 --> 04:42.753
I feel awful.

04:42.754 --> 04:45.188
Yeah, you, uh, you look awful.

04:45.189 --> 04:47.858
Thanks, that's exactly what
I want to hear on my birthday.

04:47.859 --> 04:49.926
Well, hey, birthday achieved, right?

04:49.927 --> 04:52.162
God, you're burning up. We
got to get you to a hospital.

04:52.163 --> 04:54.305
- Get off me.
- No, you have to go to a doctor.

04:54.306 --> 04:56.266
On three. One, two...

04:58.035 --> 05:01.204
I just need some personal space.
I'm sorry, I don't feel good.

05:01.205 --> 05:03.173
Hi, I'm Dr. Kay.

05:03.174 --> 05:04.575
How are we doing this morning, Miss...

05:04.576 --> 05:05.609
Chambers?

05:05.610 --> 05:07.543
Oh, you're so perky.

05:07.544 --> 05:09.279
That's great, that's great.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.848
Well, we... like I told
the other doctors...

05:11.849 --> 05:14.584
are throwing our intestines up.

05:14.585 --> 05:15.986
That's how we are doing.

05:15.987 --> 05:17.720
Humor.

05:17.721 --> 05:19.055
That's always a good sign.

05:19.056 --> 05:21.291
Really? Doesn't feel like a good sign.

05:21.292 --> 05:24.427
Kind of feels like I'm dying.

05:24.428 --> 05:27.264
Well, we're still
waiting on some results.

05:27.265 --> 05:30.133
Um, have you consumed any
raw fish in the past 24 hours?

05:30.134 --> 05:32.468
Oh, I can't believe you
just said "raw fish". No.

05:32.469 --> 05:35.038
- Chicken?
- No. No chicken. No.

05:35.039 --> 05:37.207
How about mushrooms?

05:37.208 --> 05:38.675
Oh, like magic mushrooms?

05:38.676 --> 05:41.644
We should've done that since
it was my birthday party.

05:41.645 --> 05:44.915
Your birthday party? I see.

05:44.916 --> 05:47.249
How much alcohol did
you consume last evening?

05:47.250 --> 05:50.252
Before or after I got to the bar?

05:50.253 --> 05:51.253
Total.

05:51.254 --> 05:54.389
Hmm...

05:54.390 --> 05:56.258
Six...

05:56.259 --> 05:58.493
teen... ?

05:58.494 --> 06:00.896
- Give or take.
- Right.

06:00.897 --> 06:04.766
Um, well, while we wait for
the results of your blood test,

06:04.767 --> 06:06.567
let's keep you hydrated.

06:08.839 --> 06:10.405
- Thank you.
- Okay.

06:10.406 --> 06:11.506
She is perky.

06:11.507 --> 06:12.674
All right, I'm out of here.

06:12.675 --> 06:14.310
Whoa, hey, hey. Where do
you think you're going?

06:14.311 --> 06:18.214
Ohh, dizzy. Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy.

06:18.215 --> 06:19.448
I want to go home.

06:19.449 --> 06:21.350
All right, well, let
me see what's going on

06:21.351 --> 06:23.219
so we can get you out of here.

06:23.220 --> 06:26.163
Dr. Griffin, patient not
showing any signs of...

06:26.164 --> 06:27.222
Hey.

06:27.223 --> 06:28.590
Everything okay?

06:28.591 --> 06:32.074
This is Dr. Griffin, head
of infectious diseases.

06:32.075 --> 06:33.132
Infectious?

06:33.133 --> 06:35.180
What's your relationship
to Ms. Chambers?

06:35.181 --> 06:36.539
Boyfriend. Kinda.

06:36.540 --> 06:39.517
It depends on the day... hour.

06:39.518 --> 06:40.535
What's going on?

06:40.536 --> 06:43.791
Hepatic panel shows her liver
enzymes are extremely high.

06:43.792 --> 06:45.092
Meaning...?

06:45.093 --> 06:47.685
We could be looking at liver failure.

06:47.686 --> 06:49.912
Liver f... Excuse me?

06:49.913 --> 06:52.204
Your friend, I'm sorry
to say, is very sick.

06:52.205 --> 06:54.416
An infectious disease
is attacking her body.

06:54.417 --> 06:55.618
Now, we'll know more

06:55.619 --> 06:57.587
once we get the full
toxicology results back,

06:57.588 --> 06:59.479
but for now, the best course of action

06:59.480 --> 07:01.801
is to treat it with an
aggressive dose of antibiotics.

07:01.802 --> 07:02.931
Paging Dr. Griffin.

07:02.932 --> 07:04.960
- Dr. Griffin, please contact 823.
- Oh, excuse me.

07:16.239 --> 07:21.943
She's gone from 94/96
to 170/100 and elevating.

07:21.944 --> 07:24.779
Yeah. And those platelets
are just way too high.

07:24.780 --> 07:27.448
Look, I-I'll call you back.

07:29.852 --> 07:31.919
- Patient been out of the country?
- No.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.288
Her white blood count
is through the roof.

07:34.289 --> 07:36.290
Fever spiking, she could be approaching

07:36.291 --> 07:37.914
a multi-system organ failure.

07:37.915 --> 07:38.926
Ebola?

07:38.927 --> 07:40.561
More likely pneumococcal pneumonia,

07:40.562 --> 07:44.499
but I've never seen a
bacteria move this quickly.

07:48.803 --> 07:49.970
We need to quarantine

07:49.971 --> 07:51.639
anyone who's been in
contact with the patient

07:51.640 --> 07:53.341
over the past 24 hours.

07:53.342 --> 07:55.009
We could be looking at an outbreak.

07:55.010 --> 07:57.445
Get her into isolation right now.

07:57.446 --> 08:01.715
Transfer for Ward 3.
Transfer for Ward 3.

08:01.716 --> 08:03.751
Yeah, can I have the CDC, please?

08:14.796 --> 08:16.296
Lieutenant Governor.

08:16.297 --> 08:17.932
Detective Tolan.

08:17.933 --> 08:19.499
Is Special Agent Elliot here?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.101
Mm-hmm.

08:21.102 --> 08:22.426
Mornin'.

08:22.427 --> 08:24.923
I'm here to inform you
and the Lieutenant Governor

08:24.924 --> 08:26.857
that you're to be quarantined
until further notice.

08:26.858 --> 08:28.196
Quarantined?

08:28.197 --> 08:29.898
For what? An outbreak.

08:29.899 --> 08:31.299
Some kind of dangerous bacteria

08:31.300 --> 08:33.368
you two were exposed to
at Cat's party last night.

08:33.369 --> 08:34.969
How many people are ill?

08:34.970 --> 08:36.571
Only one so far.

08:36.572 --> 08:37.871
Cat Chambers.

08:37.873 --> 08:39.107
- No one else?
- Not yet.

08:40.708 --> 08:42.610
Okay. Thank you.

08:44.547 --> 08:45.980
Hello, Governor.

08:45.981 --> 08:47.848
Yes, I'm fine.

08:49.185 --> 08:50.785
I understand full well the danger,

08:50.786 --> 08:52.587
but we don't have the
financial resources

08:52.588 --> 08:53.954
for this kind of situation.

08:55.824 --> 08:59.227
Let's declare an emergency
and let the Feds foot the bill.

08:59.228 --> 09:00.495
Right, okay.

09:01.497 --> 09:04.232
Highly contagious illness?

09:04.233 --> 09:05.433
Do you feel okay?

09:05.434 --> 09:07.201
Yeah. You?

09:07.202 --> 09:08.636
Fine.

09:08.637 --> 09:11.038
Every simulation that the
CDC ran for us at Quantico

09:11.039 --> 09:13.540
involved dozens of
patients, not just one.

09:13.541 --> 09:15.042
Somebody else ought to be ill by now.

09:15.043 --> 09:17.144
Well, maybe they just haven't
gone to the hospital yet.

09:17.145 --> 09:19.046
No. It's a small island.

09:19.047 --> 09:21.248
If you're that ill, we would've known.

09:21.249 --> 09:23.784
And there's nothing wrong with us,

09:23.785 --> 09:25.117
only her.

09:42.470 --> 09:45.271
Hi, Special Agent Jake Elliot, FBI.

09:45.272 --> 09:47.540
That was quick. I just got
off the phone with the CDC.

09:47.541 --> 09:50.476
- Oh, they didn't send me.
- Then why are you here?

09:50.477 --> 09:53.546
I'm Cat Chambers'... ex-husband.

09:53.547 --> 09:55.115
Look, since you're talking to the CDC,

09:55.116 --> 09:58.318
we both know that this is not
a random illness, now, is it?

09:58.319 --> 09:59.920
No.

09:59.921 --> 10:02.155
All indications are Ms.
Chambers has a weaponized,

10:02.156 --> 10:03.590
gram-positive infectious agent

10:03.591 --> 10:04.758
consuming her body.

10:04.759 --> 10:05.859
Weaponized?

10:05.860 --> 10:07.393
So she was deliberately targeted.

10:07.394 --> 10:09.830
- How?
- Through skin contact, ingestion...

10:09.831 --> 10:11.732
it's hard to pinpoint just yet.

10:11.733 --> 10:13.666
But you can cure her, right?

10:13.667 --> 10:16.368
Agent Elliot, her organs
are attacking themselves.

10:17.504 --> 10:18.638
Meaning... ?

10:18.639 --> 10:22.308
At this rate, I believe Ms. Chambers has

10:22.309 --> 10:26.045
less than 48 hours left to live.

10:26.046 --> 10:27.547
I'm sorry.

11:00.361 --> 11:02.562
Hey.

11:02.563 --> 11:05.865
Hey. Nice bike.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.500
Get dressed.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.636
I'm taking you away.

11:09.637 --> 11:11.070
Where are we going?

11:11.071 --> 11:13.105
- Las Vegas.
- Vegas?

11:13.106 --> 11:14.873
Mm-hmm.

11:14.874 --> 11:18.077
You know that dress I love?

11:18.078 --> 11:19.578
Uh...

11:19.579 --> 11:21.580
The white one?

11:21.581 --> 11:23.182
Don't forget to pack it.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.684
We leave tonight.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.556
Where am I?

11:40.557 --> 11:42.327
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:42.328 --> 11:43.761
Wh-What am I doing here?

11:43.762 --> 11:45.930
You're home.

11:45.931 --> 11:49.500
Doctors thought you'd
be more comfortable here.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.836
Plus quarantine's been lifted, so...

11:51.837 --> 11:54.405
- Quarantine?
- Yeah.

11:54.406 --> 11:56.707
They thought you might be
contagious, but you're not.

11:56.708 --> 11:58.009
That's a good thing for you

11:58.010 --> 12:02.847
since you're in, like,
spitting distance of me.

12:04.883 --> 12:06.984
Um, is that a nurse,

12:06.985 --> 12:10.621
or did I get involved
in some kinky role play?

12:12.024 --> 12:14.525
She's, uh... she's here to
help make you comfortable.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.594
That sounds like a euphemism for,

12:16.595 --> 12:19.864
"Cat, you're in a whole
crap load of trouble."

12:19.865 --> 12:21.865
What is going on?

12:21.866 --> 12:24.768
Someone gave you a deadly
bacteria on purpose.

12:26.504 --> 12:28.572
Ow, don't make me laugh, it hurts.

12:28.573 --> 12:29.772
You're joking, right?

12:31.742 --> 12:33.042
You're not joking.

12:35.113 --> 12:38.014
Why would anyone want to make me sick?

12:38.015 --> 12:42.086
It wasn't just making you sick.

12:42.087 --> 12:44.721
What are you saying?

12:44.722 --> 12:45.988
This could kill me?

12:49.194 --> 12:50.561
We're going to figure this out.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.130
Now, the doctor says, based on the speed

12:53.131 --> 12:54.966
of which the bacteria is
spreading through your body,

12:54.967 --> 12:57.301
he's got a pretty solid guess
that it entered your bloodstream

12:57.302 --> 12:58.841
11 to 12 hours ago.

12:58.842 --> 13:00.470
At my birthday party?

13:00.471 --> 13:01.638
Mm-hmm.

13:01.639 --> 13:03.073
Great.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.173
Yeah, someone wants you dead.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.610
Yeah, it seems so.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.444
The Point Bar doesn't
have any security cameras,

13:08.445 --> 13:10.313
but I can pull cellphone footage,

13:10.314 --> 13:12.348
photos, social media posts.

13:12.349 --> 13:15.225
If we can find out who did this
to you, we can find an antidote.

13:15.226 --> 13:18.061
You know what? Wyatt,
wait. I'm coming with you.

13:18.062 --> 13:19.485
- I'm not just gonna lay here and
- No, Cat. Nurse. Cat.

13:19.486 --> 13:20.497
die like a big wuss.

13:20.498 --> 13:22.696
- Do not. Hey, yo, Nurse Ratched,
- Try and take it easy, sweetheart.

13:22.697 --> 13:23.767
- I told you...
- Take it easy.

13:23.768 --> 13:25.443
- This is gonna help you sleep.
- You're drugging me.

13:25.444 --> 13:27.178
- You can't just...
- It's okay.

13:41.751 --> 13:43.051
Is that absinthe?

13:44.454 --> 13:47.256
148 proof.

13:47.257 --> 13:49.692
Distilled from the finest botanicals

13:49.693 --> 13:51.294
Versailles has to offer.

13:51.295 --> 13:53.162
- Ohh.
- This was Hemingway's

13:53.163 --> 13:57.066
personal favorite cure
for a tropical hangover.

13:59.102 --> 14:02.404
Well, i-is that part of
Hemingway's cure, too?

14:02.405 --> 14:04.672
Oh, no.

14:04.673 --> 14:08.043
This is for us.

14:08.044 --> 14:09.811
Our divorce papers.

14:17.553 --> 14:19.687
The boat is finally finished.

14:19.688 --> 14:23.691
She's seaworthy, and I'm set to sail.

14:23.692 --> 14:25.659
But not without you.

14:27.230 --> 14:29.998
But you... you lied to me.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.167
And you chose your job over me.

14:32.168 --> 14:34.236
This is why...

14:34.237 --> 14:36.237
I'm leaving the FBI.

14:36.238 --> 14:37.605
You are?

14:37.606 --> 14:39.407
You're leaving for me?

14:41.410 --> 14:44.846
I got everything I could ever need

14:44.847 --> 14:48.348
right here in front of me
for the rest of my life.

14:50.986 --> 14:55.356
So, no more Reef.

14:55.357 --> 14:57.558
No more FBI.

14:57.559 --> 14:59.927
Just you and I.

14:59.928 --> 15:03.296
And a whole lot of sunsets.

15:03.297 --> 15:04.564
Your wedding ring.

15:04.565 --> 15:07.065
I never really took it off.

15:08.418 --> 15:09.503
Kitty Cat.

15:09.504 --> 15:10.704
Hmm?

15:10.705 --> 15:16.610
You are the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.144
I love you.

15:20.247 --> 15:22.148
I love you.

15:37.964 --> 15:42.435
It's hard to believe, after
everything I've been through,

15:42.436 --> 15:45.103
this is how it ends, you know?

15:46.606 --> 15:50.509
No, Wyatt has almost
everybody's cellphone.

15:50.510 --> 15:51.644
He's scouring the footage.

15:51.645 --> 15:53.078
We're gonna find who did this.

15:53.079 --> 15:54.780
Yeah.

15:54.781 --> 15:57.850
But, hey...

15:57.851 --> 16:01.787
We have been through
a lot worse situations.

16:01.788 --> 16:06.157
I am not letting you die, Cat.

16:08.061 --> 16:09.427
Okay.

16:21.374 --> 16:23.041
Hey, Jake...

16:24.877 --> 16:26.411
It's okay.

16:29.082 --> 16:32.050
What is?

16:32.051 --> 16:34.052
To be scared.

16:49.935 --> 16:52.370
Happy birthday, Cat!

16:52.371 --> 16:53.538
Got anything?

16:53.539 --> 16:56.040
Sure. Lots of drunk people having fun.

16:56.041 --> 16:57.475
You?

16:57.476 --> 17:00.277
Wait, actually... yeah.

17:00.278 --> 17:03.447
Lab results just came back
with high traces of carnauba wax

17:03.448 --> 17:06.851
and mineral oil adhering to
the bacteria in Cat's blood?

17:06.852 --> 17:09.086
Meaning it was passed
to her through surf wax?

17:09.087 --> 17:11.021
No. Lipstick.

17:11.022 --> 17:12.624
"Lady Noir". Cat's favorite.

17:12.625 --> 17:15.092
Means someone had to get
Cat's bag to get the lipstick.

17:15.093 --> 17:16.093
Oh, yeah.

17:21.266 --> 17:24.165
There. See that? On
the shelf behind them?

17:24.165 --> 17:26.337
That's Cat's handbag.

17:26.338 --> 17:27.738
Blow that up.

17:31.209 --> 17:33.310
Go back, go back.

17:33.311 --> 17:34.512
Okay, play from there.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.883
All right, freeze it.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.119
That's him. That's our assassin.

17:59.832 --> 18:02.966
Well, every girl deserves a white dress

18:02.967 --> 18:05.502
on their wedding day.

18:05.503 --> 18:07.970
Speak up if you disagree.

18:09.573 --> 18:10.874
Up.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.643
Hey, come on in.

18:12.644 --> 18:14.111
Too early for mimosas?

18:17.115 --> 18:20.117
It's never too early for a mimosa.

18:20.118 --> 18:22.318
I'll have mine straight up.

18:22.319 --> 18:24.320
So?

18:24.321 --> 18:26.422
You and Jake...

18:26.423 --> 18:28.692
leaving...

18:28.693 --> 18:30.160
on his boat.

18:30.161 --> 18:31.427
He told you about that?

18:31.428 --> 18:33.496
Oh, honey.

18:33.497 --> 18:36.498
Jake tells me everything.

18:36.499 --> 18:40.569
Don't worry, I know the
two of you belong together.

18:40.570 --> 18:42.705
What? You were expecting a fight?

18:42.706 --> 18:45.348
Yeah, I was expecting a fight.

18:45.349 --> 18:47.442
- I mean...
- To you and Jake.

18:48.745 --> 18:50.379
I can see it now.

18:50.380 --> 18:55.417
You, Jake, all alone in
the middle of the ocean.

18:55.418 --> 18:57.153
Very romantic, right?

18:57.154 --> 18:58.988
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

18:58.989 --> 19:00.389
Just the two of you,

19:00.390 --> 19:06.195
surrounded by nothing but
thousands of miles of water.

19:07.297 --> 19:09.612
Nowhere to go or escape to

19:09.613 --> 19:12.880
when you, you know,
get into an argument.

19:14.469 --> 19:15.870
What are you really here for?

19:15.871 --> 19:18.239
I came here to tell you a single fact.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.042
That you really shouldn't go.

19:21.043 --> 19:23.111
Oh, not because of me.

19:23.112 --> 19:24.478
For Jake's sake.

19:24.479 --> 19:27.515
You already know how this ends.

19:27.516 --> 19:29.117
Don't you?

19:32.788 --> 19:35.289
I'm just gonna sit on your porch.

19:41.697 --> 19:42.922
Ana?

19:42.923 --> 19:44.579
Hey.

19:44.580 --> 19:45.665
Where's Jake?

19:45.666 --> 19:48.226
He had to leave. Um...

19:48.227 --> 19:50.375
There was a break in the investigation.

19:50.376 --> 19:52.303
Okay. That's good, right?

19:52.304 --> 19:53.671
It is.

19:53.672 --> 19:54.871
Can I get you something?

19:54.872 --> 19:56.339
I'm freezing.

19:59.753 --> 20:00.803
Thank you.

20:06.951 --> 20:08.385
Do you like me?

20:10.622 --> 20:12.455
Is that a trick question?

20:13.958 --> 20:16.559
What do you think about
me being with Wyatt?

20:18.368 --> 20:20.035
Well, he's my brother.

20:20.036 --> 20:22.337
Mm-hmm.

20:22.338 --> 20:23.939
I love him, and...

20:23.940 --> 20:27.843
if you make him happy,
then I support him.

20:27.844 --> 20:31.013
If I make him happy.

20:31.014 --> 20:34.215
And he's doing everything
he can for you right now.

20:34.216 --> 20:35.884
Okay?

20:35.885 --> 20:37.686
Okay.

20:37.687 --> 20:39.738
He's gonna figure this out, Cat.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.290
I'm so cold.

20:42.291 --> 20:43.591
Ohh...

20:46.006 --> 20:48.030
_

20:51.901 --> 20:54.302
Nurse.

20:56.738 --> 20:57.772
I'm gonna have to go.

20:59.908 --> 21:01.441
Let's get you back into bed.

21:09.450 --> 21:10.951
Hey.

21:10.952 --> 21:12.452
Anything from the State Department?

21:12.453 --> 21:15.855
They're... They're
working back channels.

21:15.856 --> 21:18.483
The Australians are sending
one of their top diplomats

21:18.484 --> 21:22.095
despite claiming no
knowledge of your suspect.

21:22.096 --> 21:24.665
Look, I know this is
really hard for you.

21:24.666 --> 21:26.166
Oh, for all of us.

21:26.167 --> 21:28.435
Yeah, for all of us.

21:28.436 --> 21:29.903
But especially you.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.775
You think I'm still in love with Cat?

21:35.776 --> 21:37.911
Well, I know you think you are, but...

21:37.912 --> 21:41.248
no, I... I don't.

21:41.249 --> 21:43.015
I don't even know what that means.

21:45.687 --> 21:49.590
Trying to recapture
something that was...

21:49.591 --> 21:51.791
that was great and exciting

21:51.792 --> 21:54.059
because it couldn't possibly
last is one thing, but...

21:55.362 --> 21:56.995
It's not love.

22:00.467 --> 22:02.435
You think this is the
right place and time

22:02.436 --> 22:04.403
for a discussion like this?

22:04.404 --> 22:07.707
Yes, I do.

22:07.708 --> 22:10.809
Because I want you to
know that I'm still here...

22:10.810 --> 22:12.745
for now.

22:12.746 --> 22:14.613
Okay?

22:16.082 --> 22:18.150
Now, go and save Cat's life.

22:29.129 --> 22:31.396
Can I get you something?
Coffee or some water?

22:31.397 --> 22:33.866
Oh, two fingers of a single malt

22:33.867 --> 22:35.801
would be good.

22:35.802 --> 22:38.536
- Sorry.
- Never hurts to ask.

22:38.537 --> 22:39.571
Please, take a seat.

22:39.572 --> 22:41.306
No, thank you.

22:41.307 --> 22:44.142
I suppose we should
get down to business.

22:46.312 --> 22:48.013
Yeah, who's this man?

22:48.014 --> 22:50.115
Someone we have.

22:50.116 --> 22:52.484
And from your expeditious
arrival here on the Reef,

22:52.485 --> 22:54.086
I'm assuming your government wants back

22:54.087 --> 22:56.588
quickly and discreetly.

22:56.589 --> 22:58.891
You're certain about that?

22:58.892 --> 23:01.626
FBI has solid evidence
he's done contract work

23:01.627 --> 23:04.996
for the Australian Secret
Intelligence Service.

23:04.997 --> 23:08.166
Spying on your allies
has serious consequences.

23:08.167 --> 23:11.769
It's highly illegal and
will not be tolerated.

23:11.770 --> 23:15.539
And, uh, you're looking
to overlook this if... ?

23:15.540 --> 23:17.909
Your man has given a
United States citizen

23:17.910 --> 23:19.143
a deadly toxin.

23:19.144 --> 23:22.446
A bacteria I suspect was
created by your government,

23:22.447 --> 23:25.582
which also means you have the antidote.

23:25.583 --> 23:27.651
I hope.

23:27.652 --> 23:29.320
And you're certain this is him?

23:29.321 --> 23:31.122
100%.

23:31.123 --> 23:32.290
Hmm.

23:32.291 --> 23:34.325
Hmm...

23:34.326 --> 23:37.195
Well, you're correct.

23:37.196 --> 23:39.396
He is a very bad man.

23:39.397 --> 23:41.464
But he's American-born.

23:41.465 --> 23:44.201
And while he may well have
worked for us in the past,

23:44.202 --> 23:47.437
unfortunately now,

23:47.438 --> 23:51.641
Jamie has gone off the reservation.

23:51.642 --> 23:54.710
We have no control over him.

23:56.347 --> 24:00.951
This... This woman
who is dying, she's...

24:00.952 --> 24:04.387
she's very important to us.

24:04.388 --> 24:06.890
To me.

24:06.891 --> 24:10.026
The Australian government
needs to act like a true ally

24:10.027 --> 24:11.661
and share the antidote.

24:11.662 --> 24:14.297
Well, I'm sorry.

24:14.298 --> 24:16.966
There's nothing I can
do to help your friend.

24:32.194 --> 24:34.361
You came this far.

24:36.189 --> 24:37.788
Just go in.

24:38.777 --> 24:42.446
You know, there were so many
times I wished Cat was dead.

24:42.447 --> 24:45.616
Never thought it might actually happen.

24:45.617 --> 24:48.765
I'm betting she'll pull through.

24:48.766 --> 24:51.425
Just to rub it in our faces.

24:53.461 --> 24:54.794
Go.

25:09.944 --> 25:12.546
I asked for a lawyer and
this is who you bring?

25:12.547 --> 25:15.214
Busted selling ecstasy?

25:15.215 --> 25:17.183
Hey, you're the one who told
me to stop selling Adderall.

25:17.184 --> 25:19.185
Oh, I'm glad you find this funny.

25:19.186 --> 25:20.854
Yeah, well, never lose
your sense of humor.

25:20.855 --> 25:22.088
You taught me that.

25:22.089 --> 25:23.389
So, what are you doing here?

25:23.390 --> 25:25.224
Well, I'm here to make things right.

25:25.225 --> 25:27.241
- How?
- I can get you out of here,

25:27.242 --> 25:29.394
and you can come away with me.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.196
But you gotta stop dealing drugs.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.165
You have to. Okay?

25:33.166 --> 25:36.735
You really don't want me to
end up like my dad, do you?

25:36.736 --> 25:38.938
Of course not.

25:38.939 --> 25:41.340
I don't want you to end up dead.

25:41.341 --> 25:44.209
All right, let's go. We
shouldn't even be here.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.515
- What are you doing?
- My job.

25:49.516 --> 25:51.884
Well, we can't just give up on her.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.552
You know, you do what I do long enough,

25:53.553 --> 25:56.154
and you get to learn a couple
of really important things.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.090
Like what?

25:58.091 --> 26:00.125
You can't save everyone,

26:00.126 --> 26:04.829
and some people ain't worth the effort.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.722
And that girl is both.

26:06.723 --> 26:08.394
Well, you know what?
I don't believe you.

26:08.395 --> 26:09.501
We can help her.

26:09.502 --> 26:10.735
Face it.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.904
She's looking at Federal charges.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.272
You know what that means.

26:18.343 --> 26:20.444
That means she does real time.

26:20.445 --> 26:21.713
Oh, yeah.

26:21.714 --> 26:26.250
You have done everything you can.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.986
Now...

26:27.987 --> 26:30.254
get on that boat with me

26:30.255 --> 26:33.290
and leave it all behind.

26:35.293 --> 26:36.928
But I don't want her to die.

26:46.470 --> 26:47.905
Petra...

26:47.906 --> 26:50.140
I'm really glad you're here.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.676
Yeah, well, Otter made me, so...

26:52.677 --> 26:54.611
Uh-huh.

26:54.612 --> 26:57.180
Stop pretending like you hate me.

26:57.181 --> 26:58.381
I know you don't.

26:58.382 --> 27:00.450
Are you ever gonna stop
telling me what to do?

27:00.451 --> 27:02.885
Nope.

27:04.756 --> 27:08.959
If you're expecting me
to say I forgive you,

27:08.960 --> 27:11.795
I'm not gonna do that.

27:11.796 --> 27:14.631
You don't have to forgive me.

27:14.632 --> 27:17.799
But I need you to
listen really hard, okay?

27:19.836 --> 27:24.874
If I'm not here to ride your
ass, I want you to make good...

27:24.875 --> 27:27.343
choices.

27:27.344 --> 27:29.411
Because you can have a good life.

27:31.582 --> 27:34.450
You're smart...

27:34.451 --> 27:35.951
and brave...

27:38.822 --> 27:42.058
... and you've got this.

27:42.059 --> 27:45.227
It's gonna be okay.

27:45.228 --> 27:47.128
100%.

27:48.999 --> 27:52.167
Okay?

27:52.168 --> 27:54.236
Can you please just not die?

28:00.110 --> 28:01.510
I'll work on that.

28:05.616 --> 28:07.516
Let me tell you how
this is gonna go down.

28:07.517 --> 28:09.918
She dies, you die.

28:09.919 --> 28:12.053
Murder one, pre-meditated,

28:12.054 --> 28:14.689
you get the death penalty.

28:14.690 --> 28:17.358
You want me to tell you a
little about lethal injections?

28:17.359 --> 28:19.327
Apparently, the first
shot puts you to sleep,

28:19.328 --> 28:23.231
but I don't buy that
crap, not for a second.

28:23.232 --> 28:27.102
One guy, he dug his hands
so hard into the table,

28:27.103 --> 28:30.071
he ripped his fingernails out
before he was even halfway gone!

28:30.072 --> 28:31.688
Detective, interview's over.

28:31.689 --> 28:32.774
You, on your feet.

28:32.775 --> 28:34.009
Officer, cuff him,

28:34.010 --> 28:36.111
get him ready for a Federal
Marshal to pick him up.

28:36.112 --> 28:38.079
What are you doing?

28:38.080 --> 28:41.382
Ah, the guy's being
transferred to a federal prison,

28:41.383 --> 28:43.717
where a U.S. Marshal is
going to take custody.

28:43.718 --> 28:46.521
So what the hell am I
supposed to do? Just give up?

28:46.522 --> 28:48.456
No.

28:48.457 --> 28:51.057
You need to be with Cat
while there's still time.

29:07.409 --> 29:10.178
You know that woman who's dying...

29:10.179 --> 29:12.680
I used to be married to her.

29:12.681 --> 29:15.516
Well, still am, technically.

29:22.923 --> 29:25.525
Interesting tidbit. I wasn't aware.

29:32.366 --> 29:35.034
You know, if you're trying to scare me,

29:35.035 --> 29:37.003
it didn't work back in the station.

29:40.741 --> 29:43.610
I'm a wanted man in my country alive.

29:43.611 --> 29:46.012
The secrets I know, I'll
be extradited by morning,

29:46.013 --> 29:48.281
so let's cut the tough-guy act, please.

29:52.752 --> 29:53.885
What are you doing?

29:53.886 --> 29:57.423
When we hit, I want to
make sure I don't survive.

30:01.761 --> 30:03.529
No air bags, no roof,

30:03.530 --> 30:04.963
40-year-old seatbelts.

30:07.434 --> 30:10.068
You manage to live, you'll
be eating food through a straw

30:10.069 --> 30:11.837
for the rest of your life.

30:17.677 --> 30:19.845
What the hell are you
doing?! You're crazy!

30:23.398 --> 30:24.482
Where's the antidote?!

30:24.483 --> 30:25.550
I don't have it, I swear!

30:25.551 --> 30:26.601
What about the bacteria?!

30:28.721 --> 30:30.121
I don't have it, I swear!

30:32.090 --> 30:33.691
Okay, stop, I'll talk!

30:52.844 --> 30:54.445
Why does the Australian government

30:54.446 --> 30:55.713
want Cat Chambers dead?

30:55.714 --> 30:57.547
They don't.

30:57.548 --> 30:59.083
This was just a free lance job,

30:59.084 --> 31:01.952
a chance to make some quick cash.

31:01.953 --> 31:03.120
Who hired you?

31:03.121 --> 31:05.656
I don't ask.

31:05.657 --> 31:07.724
Tell me about the bacteria.

31:07.725 --> 31:08.926
Where did you get it?

31:08.927 --> 31:11.262
This scientist, okay?

31:11.263 --> 31:12.997
He used to work with
our intelligence agency.

31:12.998 --> 31:15.032
He disappeared to these
parts a couple of years back.

31:15.033 --> 31:18.068
How did you make contact?

31:18.069 --> 31:20.905
Dark net, but he'll have
burnt any trail by now.

31:20.906 --> 31:23.073
You better give me
something more than that,

31:23.074 --> 31:25.910
or am I gonna bury you out here.

31:25.911 --> 31:27.111
When our scientist went AWOL,

31:27.112 --> 31:28.679
we were able to ping an offshore account

31:28.680 --> 31:30.114
to a shell company here on the Reef.

31:30.115 --> 31:33.249
That doesn't help.

31:33.250 --> 31:35.885
I don't know, man, he was
just some local business guy.

31:35.886 --> 31:37.421
Think!

31:37.422 --> 31:40.089
Uh, E-East... Eastland.

31:40.090 --> 31:41.590
Carter Eastland.

31:43.328 --> 31:45.093
Carter Eastland.

31:56.194 --> 31:57.727
I knew you weren't letting him go.

31:57.728 --> 31:58.995
That's why I'm still here.

31:58.996 --> 32:00.730
We got to get to Carter Eastland, now.

32:00.731 --> 32:02.765
He's stepping out of
his office in 15 minutes.

32:04.369 --> 32:06.536
I think maybe I better
do this on my own.

32:11.308 --> 32:13.476
Mike.

32:13.477 --> 32:16.746
Mike, that's not the
answer I was looking for.

32:16.747 --> 32:18.414
Not even close.

32:18.415 --> 32:20.884
Sorry, sir, I tried
to stop them. Get out.

32:20.885 --> 32:23.486
What the hell do you
two think you're up to?

32:23.487 --> 32:25.155
- Be quiet.
- Is it Tori?

32:25.156 --> 32:26.890
No, it's not about
Tori. This is about Cat.

32:26.891 --> 32:31.061
Short version, Cat Chambers
was intentionally poisoned

32:31.062 --> 32:33.362
using a bacteria created
by an Aussie scientist.

32:33.363 --> 32:35.231
What makes you think I can help?

32:35.232 --> 32:36.599
Because you know where he is.

32:36.600 --> 32:39.069
All right, I have no idea
what you two are talking about,

32:39.070 --> 32:42.104
but this conversation is over.

32:42.105 --> 32:44.239
Or do I have to call your boss?

32:44.240 --> 32:45.708
You know, I haven't warmed up yet,

32:45.709 --> 32:47.464
but I'm pretty sure I can
throw you off that balcony.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.544
Detective, I realize you're
a little upset right now,

32:49.545 --> 32:53.048
but you and I both know
you wouldn't dare touch me.

32:53.049 --> 32:55.204
Yeah, well, maybe, but that
doesn't mean that we can't hurt you.

32:55.205 --> 32:57.319
Say on Dun & Bradstreet, hmm?

32:57.320 --> 32:59.354
Within a week, all your companies

32:59.355 --> 33:01.356
will be worth less than dog excrement.

33:01.357 --> 33:03.058
Based on what?

33:03.059 --> 33:05.227
Based on an FBI special agent

33:05.228 --> 33:07.662
going in front of every
cable news network

33:07.663 --> 33:10.398
and explaining how a
certain Carter Eastland

33:10.399 --> 33:13.435
is the mastermind behind
a murder-for-hire racket

33:13.436 --> 33:14.736
with international repercussions.

33:14.737 --> 33:16.704
That's a fabrication and you know it.

33:16.705 --> 33:18.072
Yeah, well, who cares?

33:18.073 --> 33:21.075
Huh? It'll make headline news.

33:21.076 --> 33:24.078
And good luck proving otherwise.

33:30.953 --> 33:33.821
The man you're looking for
is called Dr. Shane Newton.

33:33.822 --> 33:35.256
He works for my company

33:35.257 --> 33:37.491
developing alternative fuel sources.

33:37.492 --> 33:39.761
I had no idea about his past.

33:39.762 --> 33:42.529
Sure, but you knew enough to hide him.

33:42.530 --> 33:45.298
Location. Now.

33:55.943 --> 33:58.444
Hey, Doc, a word. Shh!

33:58.445 --> 34:01.181
You understand what
happens if I drop this vial?

34:01.182 --> 34:04.985
Best chance of curing
Parkinson's goes down the drain.

34:04.986 --> 34:07.119
Literally.

34:09.157 --> 34:11.091
I-I-I don't know how you found me,

34:11.092 --> 34:13.359
but if I go with you, we are all dead.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.495
Stay here and I'll kill
you myself. Now move.

34:15.496 --> 34:18.598
Where to? To someone who,
at this very moment in time,

34:18.599 --> 34:22.201
is dying because of a
concoction you cooked up.

34:22.202 --> 34:25.271
Oh. B162.

34:25.272 --> 34:27.306
There'd better be an antidote
around here somewhere, Doc.

34:27.306 --> 34:29.574
No. No, there's no antidote.

34:29.574 --> 34:33.312
It's a deadly bacteria I accidentally
created a couple of years ago.

34:33.313 --> 34:34.603
I was trying to do good...

34:34.603 --> 34:36.348
We don't care what you
did back then. She's dying.

34:36.349 --> 34:37.516
I-I'm sorry.

34:37.516 --> 34:39.185
Hey, genius.

34:39.186 --> 34:42.221
You got a 20-minute ride back
to Reef Island to figure it out.

34:42.222 --> 34:43.655
But...

35:32.561 --> 35:33.603
How is she?

35:33.604 --> 35:35.505
Not good.

35:35.506 --> 35:37.107
Who's this?

35:37.108 --> 35:40.810
That's the guy that created
the crap that's killing Cat.

35:40.811 --> 35:43.613
Can he save her?

35:43.614 --> 35:47.050
It seems that our best chance
lies in this guy's blood.

35:50.889 --> 35:52.756
Is this really the only way?

35:52.757 --> 35:55.292
I've been exposed to the
bacteria over the years.

35:55.293 --> 35:58.095
My body has built up antibodies.

36:01.732 --> 36:03.588
Well, come on. Get that line into her.

36:03.589 --> 36:07.303
We have no time. This is the only way.

36:12.175 --> 36:13.175
Now what?

36:13.176 --> 36:16.245
Now we let gravity take over.

36:16.246 --> 36:17.613
How long until we know?

36:17.614 --> 36:19.282
Only God knows.

36:51.991 --> 36:55.361
She must have been even
wilder back in the day.

36:55.362 --> 36:58.097
Oof.

36:58.098 --> 37:00.933
Statute of limitations
prevents me from saying much.

37:00.934 --> 37:03.001
Well, that, and also
I'll plead the Fifth.

37:05.539 --> 37:09.475
But let me put it to you this way...

37:09.476 --> 37:12.644
Just think about what
she's put you through.

37:12.645 --> 37:15.629
You mean running around the jungle?

37:15.630 --> 37:16.715
Being chased by

37:16.716 --> 37:18.550
machine-gun-wielding drug dealers?

37:21.955 --> 37:23.254
Or literally gambling

37:23.255 --> 37:26.024
with a plane load full
of passengers' lives?

37:26.025 --> 37:29.828
And that was when she was
on the right side of the law.

37:35.835 --> 37:37.936
Hey, guys.

37:37.937 --> 37:39.638
Cat.

37:39.639 --> 37:42.407
Cat? Hey.

37:42.408 --> 37:43.942
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:43.943 --> 37:45.911
It worked.

37:45.912 --> 37:47.378
What did?

37:47.379 --> 37:48.814
Dr. Feel Good there.

37:50.116 --> 37:51.349
Who's Dr. Feel Good?

37:51.350 --> 37:52.817
Oh, he's this crazy scientist.

37:52.818 --> 37:55.886
He actually created this deadly
bacteria, which he regretted,

37:55.887 --> 37:57.321
and... and then we had to find him,

37:57.322 --> 37:58.997
- and it was... he was on an island.
- All right, Jake.

37:58.998 --> 38:01.726
- We almost put a stop to that...
- Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake.

38:01.727 --> 38:04.929
It's really good to see you.

38:04.930 --> 38:07.632
Oh, it's good to see
you, too, Kitty Cat.

38:19.678 --> 38:22.913
Does anyone have a sandwich?
Because I'm really hungry.

38:41.366 --> 38:43.634
Pretty sure I get mine off first.

38:45.436 --> 38:47.837
You're making a big mistake.

38:47.838 --> 38:50.574
This was never about Cat, was it?

38:50.575 --> 38:52.776
She was just a pawn. You were using her.

38:52.777 --> 38:56.380
You were using us just to
draw Dr. Newton out of hiding.

38:56.381 --> 38:58.081
You know his work, eh?

38:58.082 --> 39:00.917
Well, you know why I have to do this.

39:00.918 --> 39:02.553
Not my call.

39:02.554 --> 39:04.053
Drop your weapon.

39:05.590 --> 39:06.990
Drop your weapon!

39:16.633 --> 39:18.568
Step aside.

39:20.537 --> 39:22.538
One thing I can't figure out

39:22.539 --> 39:24.059
is why not go after Eastland directly?

39:25.242 --> 39:28.711
Would you two have worked
half as hard to save him?

39:28.712 --> 39:29.978
I didn't think so.

39:40.556 --> 39:42.024
You're telling me

39:42.025 --> 39:46.561
that a mercenary who works for
the Australian Secret Service

39:46.562 --> 39:51.900
put a biochemical weapon on my
lipstick at my birthday party

39:51.901 --> 39:54.903
to find a scientist who
works for Carter Eastland?

39:54.904 --> 39:57.005
Yep. Pretty much.

39:57.006 --> 39:59.208
Yeah, we think he
targeted you because, well,

39:59.209 --> 40:00.675
everyone on the Reef thinks

40:00.676 --> 40:03.345
we'd do basically anything to save you.

40:06.082 --> 40:07.849
Oh.

40:07.850 --> 40:09.684
Well, if that is true,

40:09.685 --> 40:12.320
then it was kind of a good insane plan,

40:12.321 --> 40:14.088
getting the two of you working overtime

40:14.089 --> 40:16.958
to find an AWOL scientist.

40:16.959 --> 40:18.960
I can't take all of
this in. I need a drink.

40:18.961 --> 40:20.362
What is that, tequila? Give it to me.

40:20.363 --> 40:23.131
It's good to see
you back to your old self.

40:23.132 --> 40:24.799
Yeah, well...

40:24.800 --> 40:28.002
You know, I had some,
uh, pretty weird dreams

40:28.003 --> 40:29.203
about the two of you.

40:29.204 --> 40:30.405
Oh, do tell.

40:30.406 --> 40:34.141
Weird how? I mean, how weird?

40:34.142 --> 40:36.410
Well, I could tell you...

40:36.411 --> 40:38.245
but I'd have to kill you.

40:38.246 --> 40:41.782
Let it suffice to say
that, in my dreams,

40:41.783 --> 40:46.453
I realized that I couldn't
live without both of you.

40:50.958 --> 40:53.059
I think she's still delirious.
You know what?

40:53.060 --> 40:54.495
We should throw you a party again.

40:54.496 --> 40:57.598
You kind of ruined the last one.

40:57.599 --> 40:59.433
I'm down for another birthday party.

40:59.434 --> 41:01.067
- No lipstick.
- No lipstick.

41:02.305 --> 41:08.508
