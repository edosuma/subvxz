a message at the mosque.

You've done well.

00:04.191 --> 00:05.708
- Maybe I could find more of your relatives.
- Yes.

00:05.743 --> 00:07.868
Khava is a terrorist recruiter.

But if you want us to keep you out of the
hands of the French, you need to cooperate.

- Thanks, Papa.

I don't think you know

- Ernst.
- Terrence.

00:18.047 --> 00:19.378
I missed you.

00:19.703 --> 00:22.141
It's a directive, instructing you
to turn over Martin Odum to me.

You don't understand. I've
been hunting him for 14 years!

00:24.403 --> 00:25.795
You can bring him in again.

out for you and Katya.

12:36.993 --> 12:38.894

12:43.058 --> 12:44.998
Want to know my secret?

12:52.074 --> 12:53.408
Wise woman.

12:55.478 --> 12:57.913
Your family, you have been
in Prague for years now.

12:57.947 --> 12:59.014
Mm-hmm.

12:59.548 --> 13:02.583

attends mosque regularly,

13:02.618 --> 13:04.274

13:20.269 --> 13:23.604
The story of first
Muhammad's wife, Khadijah.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.776
Knowing there is room in
our faith for strong woman.

every day for past two weeks.

14:51.326 --> 14:52.560
Good.

14:52.594 --> 14:53.961
Now tell me why.

14:55.898 --> 14:58.966
Jamilla is one who delivers
messages to General Arsanov,

14:59.001 --> 15:00.501
not her husband.

15:00.874 --> 15:03.504
Now Doku thinks you two are friends...

15:03.539 --> 15:05.606
He will believe you when you tell him.

15:05.641 --> 15:07.076
Tell him what?

15:07.100 --> 15:10.845
That Jamilla told you
about Arsanov, the messages.

15:11.117 --> 15:14.170
But she has not spoken
of it. Why do I lie?

15:14.324 --> 15:17.952
If Doku can't trust Jamilla,

15:17.986 --> 15:19.954
he will send someone else to general.

15:19.988 --> 15:22.890
You must persuade him to send you.

15:25.827 --> 15:27.328
Doku will hurt her.

15:27.362 --> 15:29.897
Convince him not to.

15:32.294 --> 15:35.469
It will be over soon.

15:36.376 --> 15:37.700
I promise.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.921
I must go.

What have you done?

16:13.008 --> 16:17.478
Not me, it's... Jamilla.

16:17.512 --> 16:19.947
The butcher's wife.

We've become close, praying
together, going to the market.

trouble. It's nothing.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.982
Your face says it is not nothing.

16:38.433 --> 16:40.434
Jamilla, she told me a secret.

16:43.138 --> 16:45.450

to General Arsanov.

your wife to tell you.

You have done well.

don't hurt her.

33:18.389 --> 33:20.424
Sounds like one hell of a party.

33:25.063 --> 33:27.798
Excuse me.

33:27.832 --> 33:29.633
Inspector Gabriela Miskova.

33:29.667 --> 33:31.969
You are MI6, right?

33:32.003 --> 33:35.005
I think you've been reading
too many spy novels, love.

33:35.073 --> 33:36.807
Where is Dmitry Petrovich?

33:36.841 --> 33:39.509
I have no idea who that is.

33:39.544 --> 33:40.577
Bullshit.

33:41.156 --> 33:43.185
I know for a fact that
he was in the custody

33:43.364 --> 33:46.950
of FBI Special Agent
Curtis Ballard in Paris.

33:46.985 --> 33:49.486
Then he was turned over to CIA.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.688
Petrovich was an asset to MI6.

33:51.723 --> 33:53.857
CIA didn't grab him
without asking permission.

33:53.891 --> 33:57.127
Perhaps this... Agent Ballard, is it?

33:57.161 --> 33:59.529
He may be able to shine
some light on the subject.

33:59.564 --> 34:01.898
He could...

34:01.933 --> 34:04.167
but he blew his brains out.

34:06.137 --> 34:08.839
I fail to see why any of this
is relevant to the summit.

34:08.873 --> 34:11.641
In 2001, Petrovich was
a business associate

34:11.676 --> 34:14.077
of Doku Zakayev and his brother, Tamir.

34:14.112 --> 34:17.447
I know you have eyes on Tamir
in relation to the summit.

34:17.482 --> 34:20.717
Did springing Petrovich have
something to do with Tamir?

34:25.822 --> 34:28.125
It warms my heart

34:28.159 --> 34:30.193
to know we're in this fight together.

34:39.637 --> 34:41.838
We have a complication.

34:54.619 --> 34:56.620
Shit.

35:08.666 --> 35:10.236
That's not good.

35:15.973 --> 35:17.607
Jesus.

35:17.642 --> 35:18.675
I'm calling Hardy and Brenner.

35:18.710 --> 35:20.610
No. I'll handle it.

35:21.779 --> 35:23.113
It's all right.

35:23.147 --> 35:24.715
It's all right, it's me. Stay quiet.

35:24.749 --> 35:26.850
Okay?

35:26.884 --> 35:29.019
I knew you'd come.

35:29.053 --> 35:31.116
They didn't hurt you, did they, Kate?

35:31.151 --> 35:32.155
Did they hurt you?

35:32.190 --> 35:33.857
No, but I had to get out.

35:33.891 --> 35:35.726
Why didn't you call the panic number?

35:35.760 --> 35:37.817
I didn't want to talk to some stranger.

35:37.852 --> 35:39.633
- I didn't want to have to wait.
- All right.

35:39.797 --> 35:41.665
You said you were watching, so...

35:41.699 --> 35:43.800
But the computer, it's
not where you said, and...

35:43.835 --> 35:45.635
and Beslan, he doesn't trust me.

35:45.670 --> 35:48.002
He watches everything,
and... I can't do it.

35:48.164 --> 35:49.462
- Please take me with you.
- Kate...

35:49.518 --> 35:51.803
- Just tell them I tried my best, please!
- Listen.

35:52.043 --> 35:55.011
You're still wanted by the
French police, Six, the CIA.

35:55.046 --> 35:57.390
They're not gonna call off the
dogs till you finish the job.

35:57.432 --> 35:58.915
The computer's in the house.

35:58.950 --> 36:00.183
You just got to find it.

36:00.218 --> 36:01.685
There's no other option.

36:01.719 --> 36:03.553
This is a nightmare.

36:03.588 --> 36:05.889
I know. I wish it could
be some other way, but...

36:05.923 --> 36:07.557
you just got to go back.

36:08.593 --> 36:10.929
What if they catch me
sneaking in? There's a guard.

36:11.065 --> 36:12.364
Go to the front gate

36:12.530 --> 36:13.930
and ring the bell.

36:13.965 --> 36:17.601
What? How would I explain?

36:17.635 --> 36:20.003
You already know the answer to that.

36:20.766 --> 36:22.259
I just panicked.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.509
I-I thought, maybe
it's better to just...

36:25.543 --> 36:27.277
end this.

36:27.311 --> 36:29.012
Turn myself in.

36:30.296 --> 36:32.936
I'd go to jail, but at
least I'd see my mum again.

36:34.186 --> 36:35.235
My brothers.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.788
Why didn't you come to me?

36:39.279 --> 36:41.263
You and Aunt Malika have been so kind.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.785
I didn't want to put you in any
more danger than I already have.

36:47.199 --> 36:48.532
I thought...

36:48.566 --> 36:50.534
I'll find a policeman.

36:50.568 --> 36:51.902
Leave you out of it.

36:52.804 --> 36:56.157
But as soon as I was out the window,
I knew I'd made a terrible mistake.

36:57.375 --> 36:59.576
I'm so sorry.

37:00.645 --> 37:03.235
It will never happen
again, Uncle, I swear.

37:20.313 --> 37:22.021
_

37:22.087 --> 37:24.154
We've hit a snag.

37:24.189 --> 37:28.092
You said it was just a matter of
crossing "T"s and dotting "I"s.

37:28.126 --> 37:29.660
Your girl.

37:29.694 --> 37:31.005
Rachel.

37:32.331 --> 37:35.692
You know her parents are members of
the Communist Party of Great Britain?

37:35.727 --> 37:38.269
Well, their politics have
nothing to do with her.

37:38.303 --> 37:41.372
The Service views it as a security risk.

37:43.775 --> 37:46.277
You've had your fun,
boy. Now break it off.

37:46.311 --> 37:48.979
You can't tell me how to live my life.

37:49.319 --> 37:51.882
You know that's not true.

37:54.085 --> 37:56.287
I won't leave her.

37:56.321 --> 37:58.389
I love her.

38:03.361 --> 38:05.458
You take it from me, my boy:

38:06.031 --> 38:08.966
there is no room in
this business for love.

38:14.962 --> 38:17.570
_

38:24.449 --> 38:25.583
Hey.

38:25.617 --> 38:27.551
Princess!

38:27.586 --> 38:28.819
Come on!

38:28.854 --> 38:30.387
Oh.

38:30.422 --> 38:32.656
You are such

38:32.691 --> 38:35.860
a good little girl.

38:38.129 --> 38:40.664
And your Uncle Tamir...

38:43.401 --> 38:46.470
such a bad man.

38:57.682 --> 38:59.416
Katya.

39:00.685 --> 39:01.822
It's time for bed.

39:01.857 --> 39:03.520
Go see Mama.

39:10.128 --> 39:13.597
Look at me.

39:13.632 --> 39:15.733
You have done well today.

39:18.570 --> 39:20.604
Now, be a man.

39:20.639 --> 39:22.806
Clean yourself up.

39:32.446 --> 39:34.639
- You are troubled.
- No trouble.

39:34.771 --> 39:36.303
I know you better than that.

39:38.757 --> 39:42.092
I fear I am the cause...
What I told you of Jamilla.

39:42.742 --> 39:44.728
It is not your concern.

39:47.732 --> 39:50.734
I wish there was a way I could
lift the weight you carry.

39:58.743 --> 40:01.512
Doku asked me to deliver
message to general.

40:02.199 --> 40:03.480
When?

40:03.514 --> 40:05.415
Tomorrow morning.

40:07.518 --> 40:09.820
You are pleased, no?

40:11.286 --> 40:12.923
Yes.

40:14.605 --> 40:16.882
What is it? Has something happened?

40:19.764 --> 40:21.631
No, nothing.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.167
Hard day.

40:24.202 --> 40:27.337
I'm sorry for your trouble.

40:31.666 --> 40:32.909
I'm sorry for yours.

41:06.500 --> 41:08.434
_

41:08.435 --> 41:09.902
Detective Miskova?

41:13.775 --> 41:16.617
Do all you Six boys buy
your shoes at the same store?

41:19.157 --> 41:20.957
Oh.

41:20.992 --> 41:23.193
I must be very important
to get two of you.

41:23.227 --> 41:26.563
Different home offices. Same objective.

41:26.597 --> 41:28.498
You're here to tell me to back off.

41:28.533 --> 41:29.933
He wanted to.

41:30.902 --> 41:33.804
But I persuaded him that
it was in our best interest

41:33.838 --> 41:35.419
to offer you a seat at the table.

41:45.617 --> 41:47.083
Get dressed.

41:47.118 --> 41:48.318
Why? What's wrong?

41:48.352 --> 41:49.681
We're going home.

41:50.680 --> 41:51.535
London?

41:51.573 --> 41:53.456
No, your true home.

41:53.491 --> 41:55.325
Chechnya.
