HEARD FROM BRIAN?

I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH HIM ALL DAY.

00:50.951 --> 00:53.154
- ME TOO, BUT HE HASN'T
RETURNED ANY OF MY CALLS.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.422
- I HOPE HE'S ALL RIGHT.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.124
- I WONDER HOW
THE CONDEMNED MAN'S

00:56.157 --> 00:57.558
SPENDING HIS FINAL HOURS?

00:57.591 --> 00:59.193
- DOING PENANCE?
- DOING DRUGS.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.695

01:02.896 --> 01:04.298
all: BINGO.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.599
- MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.301
HE MADE IT CLEAR HE DOESN'T
WANT TO BE REMINDED.

01:07.335 --> 01:08.769
- WE'RE NOT EVEN
SUPPOSED TO MENTION IT.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.438
- IT COULD GET UGLY.
REALLY UGLY.

01:10.471 --> 01:14.542
- STILL, IT IS AN EVENT
OF HISTORIC PROPORTION,

01:14.575 --> 01:17.678
LIKE THE MOON LANDING
OR THE FALL OF COMMUNISM.

01:17.711 --> 01:20.448

TO COMMEMORATE IT.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.384

HE REMEMBERS IT.

THIS IS GOING TO HURT YOU

DEATHDAY CAKE?
- OH, YEAH.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.022
- DEATHDAY CAKE?
- I'LL HAVE SOME.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.659
SINCE I WON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE WHOLE AGE ISSUE

03:11.692 --> 03:14.262
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.796

03:15.829 --> 03:18.432
YOU FORGET ABOUT IT.
YOU GO ON.

THE ALTERNATIVE.

PARTYING WITH THE BIG BOYS.

JUST BEGUN TO FUCK.

03:30.644 --> 03:31.979
- WHAT?
- HUH?

03:32.012 --> 03:35.316
- I SAID, I'M NOT--

03:35.349 --> 03:36.717
I'M NOT GOING TO NEW YORK.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.319

DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

03:45.759 --> 03:47.495
- WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

03:47.528 --> 03:49.997
YOU'VE GOT YOUR PLANS
WITH DAVID.

BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.773
YOU EVEN PUT YOUR LOFT
ON THE MARKET.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.775

TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.778
ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I'M ALREADY DEAD.

THE MOVING MEN

04:20.994 --> 04:21.962
WERE COMING TODAY.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.797
- OH, I THOUGHT I DID.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.899
THAT ONE'S STORAGE. OKAY?

04:25.933 --> 04:28.068
- I BETTER FINISH
PACKING MY STUFF.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.539
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I DID IT.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S AN "S"
AND WHAT'S A "P."

COMIC BOOKS ARE A "P."

CLOTHES, VIDEO EQUIPMENT.

04:39.547 --> 04:43.384

- NEW ADDRESS? WHEN DID WE--
WHEN DID WE GET A PLACE?

04:48.088 --> 04:50.791
- I RENTED A HOUSE
ON THE INTERNET.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.493
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

04:52.526 --> 04:54.562
- WELL, THERE JUST WASN'T TIME.
I MEAN, WE WOULD'VE LOST IT.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.831
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THE PLACE.
IT'S GOT AN ATRIUM, A POOL.

OH, WELL, OKAY.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.411
THEN I'M GOING
TO CALL TED.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.812
HE WAS GOING TO GIVE US
A RIDE TO THE AIRPORT.

05:11.845 --> 05:15.048
- NO NEED.
I BOOKED A CAR.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.918
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

05:17.951 --> 05:23.824

UM, SO I GUESS I'LL JUST
GO TO THE BEAUTY PARLOR

05:40.441 --> 05:43.377

THE ACLU, PUT HIM RIGHT THROUGH.

- WELL, THIS DAY
IS JUST FULL OF SURPRISES.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.921
IS THIS A FUN VISIT OR
DO YOU TWO NEED A GOOD LAWYER?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.989
- HM, WHAT WE NEED
IS A GOOD LUNCH.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.124
- [chuckles]

05:57.157 --> 05:59.693
WE THOUGHT
WE'D TAKE BLAKE OUT,

05:59.727 --> 06:01.462
IF YOU CAN SPARE HIM.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.697
- OH, I'D BE HAPPY TO
IF HE WAS HERE.

06:03.731 --> 06:07.535
HE HASN'T COME IN TODAY.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.070
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I FORGOT THAT HE--

06:10.103 --> 06:12.473
HE MENTIONED THIS MORNING
HE WASN'T FEELING WELL.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.142
HE--UH, YEAH,
I THINK HE'S GOT THE FLU

06:15.175 --> 06:18.446
OR SOMETHING AND, UH,
HE DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE

06:18.479 --> 06:20.147
HIS GERMS WITH ANYONE.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.616
- WELL, THAT'S THOUGHTFUL,
BUT FRANKLY, TEDDY,

06:22.650 --> 06:24.418
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME,
AND WHEN HE IS HERE,

06:24.452 --> 06:27.020
HE'S SLOW AND HE DOESN'T
COMPLETE TASKS WE ASSIGN HIM.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.823
THE OTHER PARTNERS ARE PISSED.
THEY WANT HIM GONE.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.459
- MELANIE, LINE ONE.
- WELL, I--

06:31.492 --> 06:32.325
I'LL TALK TO HIM.
I DON'T KNOW--

EXCUSE ME, GUYS.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.731
YES, HI,
THIS IS MELANIE MARCUS.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.600
UH, I'M GETTING
SOME FALSE DATA--

06:39.633 --> 06:41.569
- DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
- ME?

06:41.602 --> 06:43.837
OH, I WOULDN'T
DREAM OF IT.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.039
EXCEPT IT'S NOT HIS GERMS
HE DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.541
IT'S HIS DRUGS.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.209
- THANK YOU
FOR NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.912
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE
SO FUCKING CYNICAL?

06:51.945 --> 06:54.181
- I'M NOT CYNICAL.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:54.214 --> 06:58.819
I'D RATHER BE FUCKING CYNICAL
THAN IN FUCKING DENIAL.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.689

- WELL, THERE ARE SO MANY
SERIOUS ISSUES TO DEAL WITH,

07:23.110 --> 07:24.978
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A NICE WAY
TO HAVE FUN WITH YOUR KIDS.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.114
- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.650
I'M NOT THAT SURE HOW EAGER
JUSTIN'S GOING TO BE.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.753

ON STAMPS THESE DAYS.

07:35.122 --> 07:38.191
COMPOSERS, BIRDS,
EVEN THE THREE STOOGES.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.993

ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.511
- OKAY.

07:59.647 --> 08:04.652
- HOW DO YOU THINK I GOT MICHAEL
TO GO ALL THOSE YEARS?

08:04.685 --> 08:05.986
IT'S THE FIRST ONE
HE'S GONNA HAVE MISSED

08:06.019 --> 08:07.688
SINCE HE WAS 18.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.823

HE'S WHERE HE BELONGS,

08:09.857 --> 08:10.824
WITH THE MAN HE LOVES.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.861
- ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
OF THE GODDAMN WORLD.

08:13.894 --> 08:17.130
- LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, DEB.
YOU'VE HAD HIM ALL THIS TIME.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.032
- LISTEN TO HIM.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.869
- TELL YOU WHAT,
WE CAN SHARE JUSTIN.

- LANCE ROCCO.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.094
PISSER OF A KISSER.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.997
I WOUND UP DANCING
WITH CONNIE.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.199
HE WOUND UP
NOT GOING AT ALL.

08:52.232 --> 08:55.903
- YEAH,
I'M NOT GOING EITHER.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.304
- WHY NOT?

08:57.337 --> 08:59.673
- LIKE VIC SAID,
IT'S FOR STRAIGHT KIDS.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.842
- I THINK THE PROM'S
FOR EVERYONE, STRAIGHT OR GAY.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.210
- THAT'S RIGHT.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.213
AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE
GROWING-UP EXPERIENCES.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.015
YOU KNOW, WHAT IN THE HELL
DO THEY CALL IT?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.017
- RITES OF PASSAGE.
- THAT'S IT.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.919
IT'S LIKE--LIKE
LOSING YOUR VIRGINITY,

09:11.952 --> 09:15.088
OR GETTING YOUR
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.690
- I'D JUST HATE
TO SEE YOU DEPRIVE YOURSELF

09:16.724 --> 09:21.228
OF THE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE
YOU THINK YOU DON'T BELONG.

09:46.654 --> 09:49.790

- HOW'RE YOU FEELING?

09:52.392 --> 09:54.261
- GREAT.

09:54.294 --> 09:57.765

09:57.798 --> 09:59.099
I STOPPED BY TO TAKE YOU

09:59.132 --> 10:00.901
MELANIE SAID

10:13.213 --> 10:17.317
BUT I'M FEELING
A LOT BETTER NOW.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.953

REALLY WELL.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.346
[stammering]
I'D HATE TO SEE YOU--

10:46.379 --> 10:50.183
- [moaning]
FUCK ME.

10:50.217 --> 10:55.889

10:55.923 --> 10:57.825
- BLAKE,
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

10:57.858 --> 10:59.059
- ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.894

11:00.928 --> 11:03.130

11:06.934 --> 11:12.239
TO FUCK THE SHIT OUT OF ME
ALL NIGHT LONG.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.975
- ALL RIGHT, STOP IT.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.343
STOP IT.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.878
STOP!

11:17.911 --> 11:19.279
I SAID STOP IT!

11:19.312 --> 11:23.016
- I WANT IT!

11:23.050 --> 11:25.385
PLEASE?

11:25.418 --> 11:28.021
[panting]

11:28.055 --> 11:30.323

OH, MY GOD.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.884
- WHAT?

12:30.918 --> 12:32.485
- THIS MAY BE THE LAST TIME
WE'RE EVER STANDING HERE

12:32.519 --> 12:35.755
AT THIS BAR
ORDERING DRINKS.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.026
- [chuckles]
IS THAT ALL?

12:39.059 --> 12:41.161
I THOUGHT
IT WAS SOMETHING SERIOUS.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.530
- YOU THINK THEY HAVE
A BABYLON IN PORTLAND?

12:43.563 --> 12:46.133
- HEH, YOU THINK THEY HAVE
ANY QUEERS IN PORTLAND?

12:46.166 --> 12:48.869
- WELL, THERE WILL BE
AT LEAST TWO THAT WE KNOW OF.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.838
- WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO COME
AND VISIT ME, WON'T YOU?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.405
- IF YOU WANTED VISITORS,
YOU PROBABLY SHOULD'VE

12:52.439 --> 12:54.174
MOVED TO SOUTH BEACH.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.344
- OH, MIKEY.

12:57.377 --> 13:01.514
THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST TIME
WE SEE EACH OTHER.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.351
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU
SO MUCH.

13:04.384 --> 13:08.055
[sniffling] NO.
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO CRY.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.322
AS MARTHA STEWART SAYS,

13:09.356 --> 13:12.292
"WHEN LIFE GETS YOU DOWN,
HAVE A PARTY."

13:12.325 --> 13:13.894
SO THAT'S WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.229
I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU A PARTY.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.900
OKAY, WE'LL NEED A THEME.
WE NEED A THEME, UM...

13:19.933 --> 13:22.069
WHAT THE FUCK
DO THEY HAVE IN PORTLAND?

13:22.102 --> 13:23.503
- LUMBERJACKS?

13:23.536 --> 13:25.605
- OH, MAYBE I WILL
COME PAY YOU A VISIT.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.041
- OH MY GOD!
I'VE GOT IT. FLANNEL.

13:28.075 --> 13:31.044
WE'LL ALL WEAR FLANNEL.
- OH, THAT'S PERFECT.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.046
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY,
YOU COULD ALWAYS BORROW SOME

13:33.080 --> 13:36.283
FROM LINDSAY AND MELANIE.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.352
- THERE, I-I FEEL
MUCH BETTER ALREADY.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.022
OH, MY GOD.
[sobbing]

13:42.055 --> 13:44.925
MY LIFE'S GOING TO BE
SO EMPTY.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.928
- YOU STILL HAVE ME.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.530
- HOORAY.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.906
- BRIAN.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.041
BRIAN!

14:03.310 --> 14:06.346
BRIAN, WAIT A SECOND!

14:06.379 --> 14:08.648
- GO HOME AND PACK.

14:08.681 --> 14:12.419
- DAVID'S TAKING CARE OF THAT.
HE'S TAKING CARE OF EVERYTHING.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.887
- WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING
WHEN YOU GET

14:13.921 --> 14:15.022
TO FABULOUS PORTLAND?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.556
OR ARE YOU GOING TO LEAVE
ALL THAT UP TO DAVID TOO?

14:16.589 --> 14:19.126
- I HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.128
YOU KNOW,
WE'VE JUST BEEN SO BUSY.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.463
LEASING HIS HOUSE,
AND TAKING CARE

14:23.496 --> 14:25.432
OF HIS PRACTICE
AND SHIPPING HIS CAR.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.101
- FUCK "HIS."

14:28.135 --> 14:31.571
WHAT ABOUT "YOURS"?

14:34.107 --> 14:36.243
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:49.957 --> 14:53.660

FOR YOU.

14:53.693 --> 14:54.894
DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?

14:54.928 --> 14:58.365
- NO, AT MY ADVANCED YEARS,
I MIGHT FALL AND BREAK MY HIP.

14:58.398 --> 15:02.135
- NAH, WILL YOU STOP
WITH THE OLD AGE SHIT ALREADY?

15:02.169 --> 15:04.704
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE 40.
- [scoffs]

15:04.737 --> 15:06.406
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING
ON FRIDAY NIGHT?

15:06.439 --> 15:07.975
- FRIDAY, FRIDAY, FRIDAY.
I DON'T KNOW.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.143
MY SHORT-TERM MEMORY'S
NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE. UH...

15:10.177 --> 15:13.680
- DO YOU WANNA COME
TO MY PROM WITH ME?

15:13.713 --> 15:16.083
- AS WHAT?
YOUR CHAPERONE?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.684
- AS MY DATE.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.020
- [chuckles]
I'D LOVE TO.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.121
- YEAH?

15:21.154 --> 15:23.223
- BUT MY PROM DRESS
IS STILL AT THE DRY CLEANERS.

15:23.256 --> 15:27.327
- OH, COME ON.
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

15:27.360 --> 15:28.728
GO AND ASK SOME GIRL.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.164
- I DON'T WANT TO GO
WITH SOME GIRL.

15:31.198 --> 15:34.367
I WANT TO GO WITH SOMEONE
I CARE ABOUT.

15:34.401 --> 15:37.704
AND IF THAT HAPPENS
TO BE A GUY, WHO CARES?

15:37.737 --> 15:38.838
- YOU KNOW,
THAT'S JUST WHAT I NEED,

15:38.871 --> 15:41.374
TO BE AT A DANCE WITH A BUNCH
OF FUCKING 18-YEAR-OLDS.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.544
- I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
FUCKING 18-YEAR-OLDS.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.717
- GO BUY A CORSAGE...

15:50.750 --> 15:54.254
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

ALL FUCKED OUT.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.236

SOMEBODY IS.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.604

16:11.638 --> 16:13.740
COFFEE. OVER HERE.
- COMING RIGHT UP.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.675
- BLAKE AND I
HAD SEX ALL NIGHT.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.611
- [chuckles]
- I GOT A HALF-HOUR'S SLEEP.

16:18.645 --> 16:22.315
- OKAY, THIS IS WHAT WE CALL
A "HIGH-END" PROBLEM.

16:22.349 --> 16:25.485
- ONLY IT WASN'T HIM
I WAS FUCKING.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.455
IT WAS SOME DRUG.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.692
DON'T LOOK SO GODDAMN SMUG.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.794
YOU WERE RIGHT, OKAY?
YOU HAPPY?

16:34.827 --> 16:39.799
- NO, TEDDY,
I'M NOT HAPPY.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.002
I'M SORRY.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.508
- WHAT THE FUCK
AM I GOING TO DO?

16:48.541 --> 16:51.144
- [sighs]
SIMPLE, HONEY.

16:51.178 --> 16:55.782
YOU'RE GOING TO DRINK
THE COFFEE, HERE'S THE CREAM.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.185
THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO GO HOME

16:58.218 --> 17:00.220
AND YOU'RE GONNA
CHANGE THE LOCKS.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.755
- JUST SHUT HIM OUT,
LIKE HE DOESN'T EXIST?

17:02.789 --> 17:06.326
- WELL, THAT, OR YOU
CAN KEEP LYING TO YOURSELF,

17:06.359 --> 17:08.195
YOU KNOW,
MAKING EXCUSES FOR HIM,

17:08.228 --> 17:10.263
LIVING IN A STATE OF PANIC
EVERY TIME HE DISAPPEARS,

17:10.297 --> 17:12.465
NOT KNOWING IF HE'S
ALIVE OR DEAD.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.535
AND THEN, WHEN HE FINALLY
SHOWS UP A MESS,

17:15.568 --> 17:17.537
HAVING THE SUPREME JOY

17:17.570 --> 17:20.640
OF PUTTING HIM
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.275
- [stammering]
I-I CAN'T.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.277
I CAN'T DO THAT.
I JUST--I JUST--

17:24.311 --> 17:29.149
- OKAY. OKAY.

17:29.182 --> 17:34.387
THEN LET'S TRY
DOOR NUMBER TWO.

17:34.421 --> 17:38.191
AUNT BETTY'S B&B.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.093
HE CAN--UH, HE CAN JOIN
THE LONG LIST

17:40.127 --> 17:45.698
OF ILLUSTRIOUS GUESTS,
LIKE LIZ AND LIZA.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.700
PLUS, UH...

17:47.734 --> 17:49.702
IT'LL BE A GOOD TEST.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.472
TO SEE WHO HE LOVES MORE,

17:52.505 --> 17:54.707
YOU...

17:54.741 --> 17:57.210
OR CRYSTAL.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.481
- FAGGOT!

18:01.514 --> 18:04.751
- FUCK YOU, HOBBS.

18:06.253 --> 18:10.423
- YOU OKAY?
WHAT AN ASSHOLE.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.858
- THANK GOD I WON'T HAVE
TO SEE HIM AGAIN

18:11.891 --> 18:14.194
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.330
- YEAH, OR ANYONE
ELSE HERE EITHER.

18:19.366 --> 18:23.170
- I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU.
[school bell rings]

18:23.203 --> 18:26.739
SO, ARE YOU GOING TO THE PROM?
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.508
- I KNOW.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.776
I WASN'T GONNA GO EITHER,
BUT DEB SAID IT

18:29.809 --> 18:32.145
WAS THIS RITE OF PASSAGE,
AND IF I MISSED IT,

18:32.179 --> 18:34.747
THEN I WOULD REGRET IT
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.583
SO I ASKED BRIAN.
- NO!

18:36.616 --> 18:39.552
- HE TURNED ME DOWN, THOUGH.
- OH, SHIT!

18:39.586 --> 18:41.388
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

18:41.421 --> 18:43.190
I MEAN, PEOPLE'S HEADS
WOULD'VE EXPLODED.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.857
- I KNOW.
IT WOULD'VE BEEN THE PERFECT

18:44.891 --> 18:47.860
"FUCK YOU AND FAREWELL"
TO ST. JAMES ACADEMY.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.637
I MISSED YOU, DAPH.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.840
- YOU TOO.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.609
- SO...

19:02.642 --> 19:05.612
HOW ABOUT YOU AND ME
GOING TOGETHER?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.247
- LIKE A DATE?

19:07.280 --> 19:10.417
- MMM, LIKE FRIENDS.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.252
BEST FRIENDS.

19:12.285 --> 19:16.323
ONLY...
WEIRDNESS OVER?

19:16.356 --> 19:18.858
- WEIRDNESS DEFINITELY OVER.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.893
- [laughs]
OKAY.

19:20.927 --> 19:25.898
- OH, I THINK THAT'S SO ADORABLE
THAT HE ASKED YOU,

19:25.932 --> 19:28.335
DESPITE THE SOMEWHAT
QUESTIONABLE DIFFERENCE

19:28.368 --> 19:29.869
IN YOUR AGES AND THE FACT THAT,
EMOTIONALLY,

19:29.902 --> 19:32.505
HE'S 12 YEARS YOUR SENIOR.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.675
- NOT GOING. TOO OLD.
- OH, SO YOU'RE 30.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.544
I KNOW,
IT'S SO TRAUMATIC.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.579
BUT IT IS SOMETHING
WE ALL GO THROUGH,

19:39.612 --> 19:41.248
IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO LIVE THAT LONG.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.450
BUT TO CARRY ON LIKE
IT'S THE END OF YOUR LIFE?

19:43.483 --> 19:46.486
- IT IS.
- IT'S THE BEGINNING.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.289
A WHOLE NEW WAY
OF THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF,

19:49.322 --> 19:52.492
FEELING A WHOLE NEW SENSE
OF ENTITLEMENT

19:52.525 --> 19:55.362
AND ACCOMPLISHMENT.

19:57.264 --> 20:01.934
- THAT'S FROM THE "LA JEUNESSE"
ANTI-AGING COMMERCIAL.

20:01.968 --> 20:05.838
I WROTE THAT FUCKING COPY.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.241
- OH.

20:08.275 --> 20:11.844
OKAY, WELL, I GUESS I ONLY
QUOTE FROM THE MASTERS. HMM.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.747
BUT IT'S TRUTH.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.650
I WANT WRINKLES.
I WANT TO HAVE GREY HAIR.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.253
I WANT GUS TO MAKE ME
A GRANDMOTHER.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.889
I WANT TO GROW OLD
WITH MELANIE.

20:22.922 --> 20:26.526
- DO YOU WANT ME TO PUKE
RIGHT HERE?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.661
I DON'T WANT GREY HAIR
AND WRINKLES.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.930
I DON'T WANT
TO BE A GRANDFATHER.

20:30.963 --> 20:35.468
AND I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT
TO GROW OLD WITH MELANIE,

20:35.502 --> 20:36.536
OR ANYONE ELSE.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.706
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

20:42.041 --> 20:44.344
- THIS.

20:44.377 --> 20:48.014
- IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL.

20:48.047 --> 20:51.751
- YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:51.784 --> 20:55.488
MAYBE I SHOULD
CELEBRATE TURNING 30,

20:55.522 --> 20:59.492
GIVE MYSELF SOMETHING
VERY SPECIAL.

20:59.526 --> 21:03.430
- NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.299
- DAVID? DAVID?
- WHAT IS IT?

21:06.333 --> 21:08.868

33:19.165 --> 33:20.166
- LIKE WHAT?

33:20.199 --> 33:23.469
- LIKE THE GREATEST
FUCKING ORGASM OF MY LIFE.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.105
- TRY THE LAST FUCKING ORGASM
OF YOUR LIFE.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.639
YOU COULD KILL YOURSELF.

33:27.673 --> 33:28.740
- WELL, THAT WOULDN'T BE
THE WORST THING

33:28.774 --> 33:31.043
THAT COULD HAPPEN.

33:31.077 --> 33:35.614
TO GO OUT IN A BLAZE
OF GLORY, LIKE COBAIN...

33:40.552 --> 33:43.189
THEY'RE ALL LEGENDS.

33:43.222 --> 33:45.291
THEY'LL ALWAYS BE YOUNG.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.359
AND THEY'LL ALWAYS
BE BEAUTIFUL.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.495
- AND THEY'LL ALWAYS
BE DEAD.

33:49.528 --> 33:53.465
- "LIFE NOT WORTH LIVING
IF YOU NOT TAKE RISK."

33:53.499 --> 33:55.267
- YOU'RE NOT GOING THROUGH
WITH IT.

33:55.301 --> 33:59.271
- IF I WANT TO EXPERIENCE
THE JOYS OF SCARFING,

33:59.305 --> 34:01.207
WHAT THE HELL BUSINESS
IS IT OF YOURS?

34:01.240 --> 34:02.608

34:07.846 --> 34:12.818
- AW, FUCK YOU, MICHAEL.
FUCK YOU.

34:12.851 --> 34:16.688
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO RUIN EVERYTHING?

34:16.722 --> 34:19.825
- RUIN? I'M SAVING YOU!
- AH?

34:19.858 --> 34:21.760

SAVED CAPTAIN ASTRO

34:21.793 --> 34:24.296
IN ISSUE 231
OF ASTRO COMICS,

34:24.330 --> 34:26.132
WHEN CAPTAIN ASTRO
THOUGHT THAT HE'D LOST

34:26.165 --> 34:28.167
ALL OF HIS SUPERPOWER.

34:28.200 --> 34:32.604
- GOD,
YOU ARE SO PATHETIC.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.574
- NO, YOU ARE!

34:35.607 --> 34:38.444
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT YOU
STILL HAVE YOUR POWERS?

34:38.477 --> 34:42.448
ALL YOUR POWERS.
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.683

OR YOU'RE 30,

34:44.716 --> 34:47.519

OR YOU'RE 100.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.188
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE YOUNG

34:49.221 --> 34:53.192

ALWAYS BE BEAUTIFUL.

- GOOD MORNING.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.343
- WELL, THE STAFF
SEEMS VERY NICE.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.345
THEY'RE REALLY HELPFUL.
- THEY DO.

35:13.379 --> 35:15.181
- YEAH. THEY SAID YOU CAN
GET ANYTHING YOU WANT, ANYTIME.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.349
YOU KNOW,
THEY GOT SNACKS ALL DAY.

35:17.383 --> 35:18.750
- THAT'S GOOD.
- YEAH.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.819
AND IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
YOU JUST, UM...

35:20.852 --> 35:23.189
- I-I WILL.

35:23.222 --> 35:27.459
- LOOK, I WANT YOU
TO KNOW HOW HAPPY--

35:27.493 --> 35:29.295
HAPPY'S NOT THE RIGHT WORD.

35:29.328 --> 35:33.199
[mumbling]
NOT HAPPY, BUT, UH,

35:33.232 --> 35:36.568
GRATEFUL AND RELIEVED I AM
THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS.

35:36.602 --> 35:39.338
- WELL, IT'S FOR US,
RIGHT?

35:39.371 --> 35:42.841
- RIGHT.

35:45.744 --> 35:49.281
[sighs]

35:54.386 --> 35:56.422
- SO...

35:56.455 --> 35:59.825
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT?
- TONIGHT.

35:59.858 --> 36:04.363
- OH, ONE MORE THING
BEFORE I FORGET.

36:04.396 --> 36:06.698
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO LISTEN TO THAT.

36:06.732 --> 36:09.668
- LA TRAVIATA.
- YOUR FAVORITE OPERA.

36:09.701 --> 36:14.673
- YEAH, IT'S THE ONLY OPERA
THAT I KNOW.

36:14.706 --> 36:17.543
EXCEPT...

36:17.576 --> 36:19.545
YOU SAID AT THE END,
THEY GET BACK TOGETHER

36:19.578 --> 36:23.349
AND SING
MANY GLORIOUS DUETS.

36:23.382 --> 36:27.586
- GUESS THAT'S THE SEQUEL.
"TRAVIATA 2."

36:40.399 --> 36:42.268
- CONSIDERING HOW YOU FEEL,

36:42.301 --> 36:45.237
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
A GOOD IDEA THAT YOU NOT GO.

36:45.271 --> 36:46.438
- YOU THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

36:46.472 --> 36:49.308
- FOR CHRIST SAKES, MICHAEL,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

36:49.341 --> 36:50.542
- "WE THINK."

36:50.576 --> 36:51.577
YOU KNOW, IF YOU USED
THE WORD OCCASIONALLY

36:51.610 --> 36:53.379
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY
GET USED TO IT.

36:53.412 --> 36:54.980
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S OBVIOUSLY
DECIDED IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.715
ONLY THIS TIME,
IT'S NOT ABOUT SCREEN DOORS

36:56.748 --> 36:58.016
OR CHANGING FLIGHTS.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.285
THIS TIME,
IT'S ABOUT BRIAN.

36:59.318 --> 37:02.388
IF YOU KNEW HE WASN'T LEAVING,
YOU WOULD'VE NEVER AGREED TO GO.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.323
- NO, DAVID.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.725
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW,
THIS TIME IT'S NOT ABOUT HIM.

37:06.758 --> 37:10.796
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

37:10.829 --> 37:14.766
- THE CAR'LL
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.504
- I CAN TAKE YOU
TO THE AIRPORT.

37:18.537 --> 37:21.540
- I KNOW YOU CAN,
BUT I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T.

37:21.573 --> 37:25.277
- OKAY, FINE.
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

37:25.311 --> 37:27.012
- THE WAY I ALWAYS DO?

37:27.045 --> 37:30.516
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WAS GOING TO SAY.

37:30.549 --> 37:34.886
I'M SORRY.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.755
- HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU,

37:36.788 --> 37:39.591
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP
APOLOGIZING, MICHAEL?

37:39.625 --> 37:41.560
- I KNOW I DON'T, BUT--

37:41.593 --> 37:45.464
- ASIDE FROM THAT...

37:45.497 --> 37:48.033
I'M THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE
APOLOGIZING TO YOU.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.602
I'M SORRY I DISREGARDED
YOUR FEELINGS,

37:50.636 --> 37:52.504
THAT I DIDN'T INCLUDE YOU
IN THE DECISIONS,

37:52.538 --> 37:56.608
THAT I EXPECTED YOU TO COME,
AND, NO...

37:56.642 --> 38:00.379
I'M NOT SURE THAT
I COULD DO THE SAME.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.518
- WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT,
BUT THAT'S--

38:06.552 --> 38:09.421
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WAS GOING TO SAY.

38:09.455 --> 38:13.058
IT'S NOT UP TO YOU TO DECIDE
WHAT I SHOULD DO WITH MY LIFE.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.526
THAT'S UP TO ME.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.963
AND IF I DIDN'T DO IT,
THEN IT'S MY FAULT.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.367
AND...

38:21.400 --> 38:23.469
MAYBE NEXT TIME,
I SHOULD JUST--

38:23.502 --> 38:27.005
I SHOULD THINK THINGS THROUGH
MORE CLEARLY BEFORE I SAY...

38:27.038 --> 38:31.042
YES.

38:31.076 --> 38:35.581
- WELL, I HOPE YOU'LL DECIDE
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.

38:35.614 --> 38:38.884
AND IF YOU DO...

38:40.118 --> 38:44.356
I'LL BE WAITING.

38:44.390 --> 38:47.693
AND THIS TIME,
ON YOUR TIME

38:47.726 --> 38:48.960
AND YOUR TERMS.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.563
[car horn honks]

39:05.577 --> 39:08.714

39:08.747 --> 39:11.550

IN THE MIDRIFF TEE

39:11.583 --> 39:14.119

WHO WENT UP THE STAIRS?

39:14.152 --> 39:18.490
WELL, JUST TAKE A LOOK
AT WHO IS COMING DOWN.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.599

39:27.633 --> 39:31.470
THE LITTLE CHICKEN'S
BECOME COCK-OF-THE-WALK.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.972
- SWEETHEART,
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

39:34.005 --> 39:36.107
- JESUS, I COULD
GO FOR YOU MYSELF.

39:36.141 --> 39:37.576

BEAT YOU TO HIM.

TO VISIT WITH BLAKE WYZECKI.

40:35.701 --> 40:38.670
- SORRY, BLAKE
CHECKED HIMSELF OUT.

40:40.972 --> 40:43.975
- HE JUST--HE JUST CHECKED
HIMSELF IN THIS AFTERNOON.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.811
- HE'S GONE.

40:45.844 --> 40:48.914
- WHAT, YOU JUST LET PEOPLE
LEAVE WHENEVER THEY WANT?

40:48.947 --> 40:53.719
- IT'S A VOLUNTARY COMMITMENT.
WE CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO STAY.

40:53.752 --> 40:54.986
- DID HE SAY
WHERE HE WAS GOING?

40:55.020 --> 40:56.622
DID HE LEAVE A MESSAGE?

40:56.655 --> 41:00.726
