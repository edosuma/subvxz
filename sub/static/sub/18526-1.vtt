<i>In a certain time,</i>
<i>in a certain land,</i>

01:34.577 --> 01:37.509
<i>once there lived</i>
<i>and once there was...</i>

01:37.577 --> 01:42.876
<i>A magic kingdom</i>
<i>at the top of the world.</i>

01:42.944 --> 01:46.542
<i>If a traveler came</i>
<i>to that cold, freezing place,</i>

01:46.611 --> 01:48.942
<i>and no traveler ever did,</i>

01:49.011 --> 01:52.175
<i>all he would see</i>
<i>would be ice.</i>

01:52.244 --> 01:55.742
<i>Mountains of ice and snow.</i>

01:55.811 --> 01:59.942
<i>But on certain nights, when the stars
of the sky shined like jewels,</i>

02:00.011 --> 02:02.575
<i>a wonderful light</i>
<i>appeared in the heavens;</i>

02:02.644 --> 02:05.809
<i>and then many lights,</i>
<i>all the colors of the rainbow;</i>

02:05.878 --> 02:08.942
<i>and some colors</i>
<i>never seen before.</i>

02:09.011 --> 02:11.475
<i>Way on top,</i>

02:11.544 --> 02:16.276
<i>the north star sparkled.</i>

02:16.344 --> 02:19.276
<i>And suddenly, the ice
mountains cracked open...</i>

02:19.344 --> 02:22.342
<i>And beautiful, beautiful</i>
<i>lights pierced the sky,</i>

02:22.412 --> 02:24.642
and then, out came
the vendegums.

02:24.711 --> 02:28.459
Hundreds of them, all in their
bright-colored clothes.

02:28.527 --> 02:31.159
Granny,
what's a vendegum?

02:31.228 --> 02:34.826
A vendegum? Those
are the little men...

02:34.894 --> 02:36.992
Who live in
the ice mountains,

02:37.061 --> 02:39.826
way at
the top of the world,

02:39.894 --> 02:43.092
under the north star.

02:43.161 --> 02:45.925
Some of them are
even littler than you.

02:45.994 --> 02:49.759
This is the same story
she told last year.

02:49.828 --> 02:52.525
Oh, when's he coming?
When's he gonna get here?

02:52.594 --> 02:55.326
The road from the village
must be blocked.

02:55.395 --> 02:57.925
Even those reindeer of his
couldn't make it through.

02:57.994 --> 03:02.292
Wouldn't be Christmas without him, though,
would it? He hasn't missed one yet.

03:02.362 --> 03:05.775
It's them! Here they come!

03:27.161 --> 03:30.475
<i>All right. Everybody back.</i>
<i>Everybody back, everybody back.</i>

03:35.044 --> 03:37.441
- What did you bring? What did I get?
- Wait.

03:40.177 --> 03:42.775
Don't I hear
something first?

03:42.844 --> 03:46.875
Happy Christmas,
Uncle claus!

03:46.944 --> 03:50.709
All right. All right. Here, for you.
And you. Thank you!

03:51.144 --> 03:54.442
Cutting wood all day
for the whole village.

03:54.510 --> 03:57.209
It's enough
to exhaust any man.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.575
<i>How does he find time</i>
<i>to make all those things?</i>

03:59.644 --> 04:01.675
<i>He makes time.</i>

04:01.744 --> 04:06.008
What can I tell you?
It gives him pleasure.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.775
Little else.

04:15.844 --> 04:18.326
For you.
Just for you.

04:18.394 --> 04:22.492
What is it?
A vendegum.

04:22.561 --> 04:24.759
<i>Just as I was</i>
<i>telling you.</i>

04:43.611 --> 04:46.942
You can't see your hand in front of your
face out there. You won't get through.

04:47.011 --> 04:50.642
My reindeer, donner and blitzen,
can get through anything.

04:50.711 --> 04:52.642
Come along, Anya.
We must hurry.

04:52.711 --> 04:54.942
More children need their toys on
the other side of the forest.

04:55.011 --> 04:57.009
'Bye, dear.

04:59.376 --> 05:01.609
Okay.

05:04.211 --> 05:06.875
Bye!
Bye!

05:06.944 --> 05:10.042
Did you see their faces
when they saw the toys?

05:10.111 --> 05:13.075
Ah, yes. They love their
Uncle claus, huh?

05:19.211 --> 05:22.609
Come on, blitzen.
Pull harder!

05:22.677 --> 05:24.675
The children
are waiting!

05:31.077 --> 05:34.308
Come on, donner.
Don't drag your hooves.

05:34.377 --> 05:37.475
Hurry along, now.
You can do it, boy.

05:37.544 --> 05:39.542
Come on!

06:05.910 --> 06:09.842
<i>I can't find it, Anya.</i>
<i>I can't find the road.</i>

06:09.910 --> 06:13.942
- Where are we?

06:15.161 --> 06:18.126
Come on, boys.
Don't slow up now!

06:21.028 --> 06:23.575
Hi-up!
Hi-up!

06:23.644 --> 06:27.026
<i>Go! Come on!</i>
<i>Blast!</i>

06:36.494 --> 06:38.425
- Come on, blitzen.

06:38.494 --> 06:42.359
Come on, my good boys.
Donner! Now listen!

06:42.427 --> 06:45.993
Over there,
there's food and warmth...

06:46.061 --> 06:48.126
And a bed
and straw and hay...

06:48.194 --> 06:52.026
And everything a smart team
of reindeer would like!

06:52.095 --> 06:54.792
<i>Here is where</i>
<i>you freeze to death.</i>

06:54.861 --> 06:59.026
Now, come on, my good boys!
Come on!

06:59.095 --> 07:01.592
Claus, come back.
I can't see you.

07:01.660 --> 07:03.692
Oh, my God.
Anya!

07:04.028 --> 07:06.675
Anya! Anya!

07:11.377 --> 07:16.742
Anya. Oh, my God. Anya! Anya!

07:16.810 --> 07:19.775
Anya, please!
Oh!

09:47.844 --> 09:50.075
They're here.

09:58.594 --> 10:00.758
Welcome.

10:02.894 --> 10:07.825
It's them. Vendegum.
The little people?

10:07.894 --> 10:12.008
We prefer to be called
elves, if you don't mind.

10:12.077 --> 10:15.508
- You-you--
- I'm the one called dooley.

10:15.577 --> 10:19.008
- We've been expecting you.
- Expecting us?

10:19.077 --> 10:22.525
For a long, long time.

10:22.594 --> 10:25.258
We almost gave up hope!

10:25.461 --> 10:27.425
<i>Where are we?</i>

10:27.861 --> 10:33.358
- Home. 
-<i> No, no, no. Our home is far from--</i>

10:33.427 --> 10:35.826
look at that! Let's go.
<i>Not anymore.</i>

10:35.894 --> 10:38.475
<i>This is your home now.</i>

10:38.544 --> 10:40.943
W-what does he mean?

10:41.010 --> 10:43.375
Uh, you don't understand.

10:43.444 --> 10:48.842
<i>We live in a village far away from
this one.</i> Blow! Bits of old ropes,

10:48.911 --> 10:51.124
single-hinge
runner connectors.

10:51.193 --> 10:53.124
This is unbelievable!

10:53.193 --> 10:55.459
<i>See I'm gonna have</i>
<i>a lot to teach him.</i>

10:55.527 --> 10:58.542
Whoops.
Hi, there.

10:59.911 --> 11:03.291
Hi. I'm the one
called patch.

11:03.494 --> 11:05.091
<i>Welcome aboard, sir. Speaking
for the boys and myself,</i>

11:05.160 --> 11:07.591
I'd-- oh, you must
be the missus!

11:07.660 --> 11:10.525
Me?
<i>Yeah. Well,</i>

11:10.593 --> 11:13.125
we were expecting someone nice, but
not someone so young and pretty.

11:13.194 --> 11:16.091
- <i> Were we, boys?</i>
- - No. No.

11:16.160 --> 11:20.191
- Oh, don't be elf-conscious! - My
friends, let us show you your new home.

11:20.260 --> 11:22.591
<i>Patch, take charge of the reindeer.
</i> Yeah. Honka!

11:22.660 --> 11:24.609
Take charge of the reindeer. Boog,
take charge of the reindeer.

11:24.678 --> 11:26.676
Vout, take charge
of the reindeer.

11:32.093 --> 11:34.792
<i>I don't understand.</i>

11:34.861 --> 11:38.025
What new home?
There's nothing here.

11:38.093 --> 11:40.491
Look again.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.859
- Where did it come from?
- <i> It was always here.</i>

11:54.927 --> 11:58.292
But it can't be seen by
just anyone, you know. Mm?

11:58.360 --> 12:02.158
Come, fellow elves. Take
them to their new home.

12:02.227 --> 12:05.158
<i>Lead and follow,</i>
<i>follow and lead.</i>

12:15.910 --> 12:18.008
He's nice,
isn't he, patch?

12:18.077 --> 12:21.008
Yeah, I tell you, boys, he gives me
a real feeling of elf-confidence.

12:21.077 --> 12:24.308
What's it all about?

12:24.377 --> 12:28.576
Maybe it's a-- aah!
No, we're awake!

13:25.143 --> 13:27.375
It's him! He's here!

13:27.444 --> 13:29.442
Yes, he's here,
he's here!

13:39.009 --> 13:43.475
Welcome, welcome. I'm the one called puffy.
We've been expecting you.

13:43.544 --> 13:45.642
Not now, puffy. The man
wants to see the sights.

13:45.711 --> 13:49.007
- Isn't this something? - Did you
hear that? He said it's something!

13:49.076 --> 13:53.092
- He did. He did!
- Oh, my!

13:53.160 --> 13:55.659
She likes it. She likes it!
She does. She does.

14:05.160 --> 14:09.025
Isn't this <i> something</i> ? Is it
warm enough for all of them?

14:09.094 --> 14:11.025
It's exactly what
I've been saying, ma'am.

14:11.094 --> 14:14.758
Now, I have an idea for a new way to
heat this entire place, using pipes!

14:17.661 --> 14:19.958
Pipes, you know?
Cylinder thingies?

14:20.027 --> 14:22.092
There's much more
to see, folks.

14:24.327 --> 14:26.425
Pipes.

14:28.127 --> 14:30.442
Pipes.
Yeah.

14:30.510 --> 14:33.609
Wait! Wait!

15:33.527 --> 15:36.292
Oh!

15:41.960 --> 15:47.592
My goodness.
What is all this?

15:48.027 --> 15:50.958
They're Christmas toys.
Waiting for you.

15:51.027 --> 15:54.125
For me.

15:54.193 --> 15:57.125
Wh-what have they
got to do with me?

15:57.193 --> 16:01.925
You're going to give
them to your children.

16:01.994 --> 16:04.425
Th-there must be a mistake.

16:04.494 --> 16:06.791
We have no children.
<i>You do now.</i>

16:06.860 --> 16:09.791
You have all
the children of the world.

16:09.860 --> 16:13.258
But how could I deliver
all these toys?

16:13.327 --> 16:15.725
I won't live
long enough for that.

16:17.293 --> 16:19.658
Both of you
will live forever.

16:20.127 --> 16:23.242
<i>Like us.</i>

16:30.027 --> 16:32.958
<i>Anya?</i>

16:33.027 --> 16:35.058
<i>Me too.</i>

16:35.127 --> 16:37.092
<i>I can't sleep either.</i>

16:37.160 --> 16:42.525
<i>I don't want to sleep.</i>
<i>This mattress is so comfortable,</i>

16:42.593 --> 16:45.125
<i>I don't want to miss</i>
<i>a moment of it.</i>

16:49.560 --> 16:52.791
<i>This-this won't take long.</i>
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

17:05.210 --> 17:08.773
<i>What is it, donner, eh?</i>
<i>You look so frightened.</i>

17:08.843 --> 17:12.174
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>to worry about.</i>

17:12.243 --> 17:15.641
<i>Really, there isn't. Easy, boy,
it's all right. Easy, now, easy.</i>

17:15.710 --> 17:20.007
Strange
place, strange companions.

17:20.076 --> 17:22.325
But we're all friends here.

17:22.393 --> 17:24.325
We are!

17:24.660 --> 17:28.242
- Look at old blitz in there.
- Does he look worried? Hmm?

17:29.543 --> 17:31.941
Come on. Maybe try
and eat something. Hmm?

17:32.244 --> 17:35.525
It's great food.
Believe me.

17:35.593 --> 17:37.674
Say, look.
Even I like it.

17:37.743 --> 17:40.674
It's delicious.

17:40.743 --> 17:43.308
Mmm! <i>He's like me, I guess.</i>

17:43.743 --> 17:45.674
Oh! Yes.
A little confused.

17:45.877 --> 17:48.375
Yeah, yeah.

17:50.510 --> 17:54.108
He's always been the fidgety type.
Yeah. Well,

17:54.176 --> 17:56.308
he'll be all right, sir, as soon
as he gets used to the place.

17:56.377 --> 17:59.608
He just needs a little
elf-control. Mm.

17:59.676 --> 18:01.608
Well, you certainly
know your reindeer.

18:01.676 --> 18:06.442
These are fine specimens. Oh! Hear that,
boys? You made a good impression.

18:06.509 --> 18:08.442
Come on.

18:08.509 --> 18:12.174
Look. These two are twins.
Prancer and dancer.

18:13.610 --> 18:16.174
<i>The way you can tell them apart
is by those snooty monocles.</i>

18:16.244 --> 18:18.974
Prancer's is
on his right eye,

18:19.043 --> 18:20.774
<i>and dancer's is</i>
<i>on his left eye.</i>

18:20.843 --> 18:23.342
And this lad with the great
big antlers is comet.

18:24.344 --> 18:26.442
And old spotted-nose
here is cupid.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.208
This white-faced boy here,
that's old dasher.

18:33.277 --> 18:36.342
He loves to run, he does, he really does.
He'd rather run than eat!

18:36.410 --> 18:39.774
And, uh, this noisy one with
the floppy jowls, he's ViXen.

18:39.843 --> 18:42.841
<i>Keep you up half the night</i>
<i>with his snorts and whinnies,</i>

18:42.909 --> 18:44.874
<i>whinnies and snorts.</i>

18:44.943 --> 18:46.874
And you sleep here?
Yes!

18:46.943 --> 18:50.041
And this is where
I do my other work.

18:50.110 --> 18:53.375
Yeah, they keep you busy, huh?
Well, I-I-I like it that way.

18:53.444 --> 18:56.874
Sometimes I get so many ideas, I don't
know where to keep them in my head.

18:56.943 --> 18:59.408
<i>Um-- oh! Look.</i>

19:01.410 --> 19:03.841
A clock that wakes you up in the morning.
How about that? Ha?

19:03.909 --> 19:05.841
That's not bad.
<i>Aha!</i>

19:05.909 --> 19:08.108
A plate that whistles
when the food's too hot.

19:08.176 --> 19:10.941
Ah?

19:11.009 --> 19:13.308
Um-- oh!
Look, look, look.

19:13.377 --> 19:16.174
<i>I've got here a
complete syste--</i> uh--

19:16.244 --> 19:18.308
what do we need
all these reindeer for?

19:18.377 --> 19:22.841
Uh, you'll see.

19:22.909 --> 19:25.441
This is a curious kind of place.
<i>This is nothing now.</i>

19:25.509 --> 19:28.874
- Wait till you see how it gets during
season's greetings. - Season's greetings?

19:28.943 --> 19:32.242
- <i> Mm-hmm. You'll see.</i>
- What's that?

19:33.377 --> 19:37.108
<i>Oh, look, sir.</i>
<i>Now he's having a bite.</i>

20:09.577 --> 20:12.474
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

20:12.543 --> 20:15.575
- Hurray!
- Hoop-ah!

20:21.493 --> 20:23.724
<i>♫</i>

20:58.476 --> 21:00.507
Maybe it's
the massive bulk of it.

21:00.577 --> 21:02.507
I never did
an extra-large before.

21:02.577 --> 21:06.775
No, the size is fine. Please
don't think I'm criticizing,

21:06.843 --> 21:08.875
but green's just
not his color.

21:08.944 --> 21:12.541
- <i> What about, um--</i>
- Brown!

21:12.610 --> 21:14.541
Red.

21:14.610 --> 21:18.541
Yes! Red!

21:18.610 --> 21:20.541
Perfect!
Matches his cheeks...

21:20.610 --> 21:22.608
<i>And everything!</i>

21:24.927 --> 21:27.024
Whee!

22:25.443 --> 22:28.257
Ah!

22:28.326 --> 22:30.257
Hey!

24:01.976 --> 24:05.708
- Oh. Well? 
- Coming closer now. Not just yet!

24:05.776 --> 24:10.108
<i>Two more degrees</i>
<i>north by northwest--</i>

24:10.276 --> 24:12.157

24:17.493 --> 24:19.741
Ohh!

24:21.776 --> 24:24.157
Ahh!

24:33.559 --> 24:37.608
- Season's greeting's back!
- Season's greetings!

24:40.343 --> 24:43.207
Season's greetings!
Season's greetings!

25:12.559 --> 25:18.190
Southeast crosswind,
point right. Northwest--

25:18.259 --> 25:20.625
are you nervous?

25:20.693 --> 25:24.658
Me, nervous? No.

25:25.660 --> 25:28.290
Oh!

25:28.359 --> 25:32.224
You look...
Wonderful to me.

25:32.292 --> 25:35.858
Uh, it does suit me,
doesn't it?

25:35.927 --> 25:39.390
A handsome man looks good
in anything.

25:39.459 --> 25:44.992
Oh, I'm so
proud of you.

25:45.059 --> 25:46.992
Mm!

25:49.426 --> 25:52.691
It's time, sir.
Oh.

25:57.126 --> 25:59.841
- They're waiting.

26:30.076 --> 26:32.007
<i>He looks wonderful!</i>

26:32.076 --> 26:35.091
It's a perfect fit,
if I do say so myself.

26:35.159 --> 26:39.991
The color, the style.. that outfit is
him, boys. I'm telling you. Just him.

27:52.276 --> 27:54.640
The prophecy...

27:54.709 --> 27:57.040
Has come to pass...

27:57.109 --> 28:00.207
That there would
come to us...

28:00.276 --> 28:02.274
A chosen one.

28:02.343 --> 28:07.140
<i>And that he, having</i>
<i>no child of his own,</i>

28:07.209 --> 28:11.374
<i>would love all</i>
<i>children, everywhere.</i>

28:12.542 --> 28:14.507
<i>And that he himself</i>
<i>would be...</i>

28:14.576 --> 28:17.774
An artisan,
and a craftsman,

28:19.176 --> 28:21.807
<i>and a skilled...</i>

28:21.877 --> 28:24.841
<i>Maker of toys.</i>

28:24.909 --> 28:29.407
And now, chosen one,
come forward.

28:37.209 --> 28:39.574
From this day on,

28:39.642 --> 28:42.140
now and forever,

28:42.209 --> 28:46.241
you will bring our gifts
to all the children...

28:46.309 --> 28:48.940
In all the world.

28:49.009 --> 28:52.374
<i>And all this</i>
<i>to be done...</i>

28:52.442 --> 28:54.507
<i>On Christmas Eve.</i>

28:54.576 --> 28:58.474
How can I do so much
in just one night?

28:58.542 --> 29:01.507
Oh, yes.

29:04.642 --> 29:07.241
Time travels with you;

29:07.309 --> 29:12.207
that the night of the world
is a passage...

29:12.276 --> 29:15.774
Of endless night
for you.

29:15.842 --> 29:19.974
Mm. Until
your mission is done.

29:20.042 --> 29:25.140
This is your legacy,
and your gift,

29:25.209 --> 29:28.574
as is the gift
of flight.

29:31.509 --> 29:34.440
Mm-hmm. Now.

29:34.509 --> 29:38.091
All those within
the sound of my voice,

29:38.159 --> 29:42.091
and all those on this
earth everywhere know...

29:42.526 --> 29:45.424
That henceforth,

29:45.493 --> 29:48.024
you will be called...

29:48.093 --> 29:50.091
Santa claus.

29:50.159 --> 29:52.024
Santa?

29:52.093 --> 29:56.924
<i>And now, everyone,</i>

29:56.993 --> 30:01.124
- <i> merry Christmas!</i>
- -Merry Christmas!

30:05.259 --> 30:07.691
Merry Christmas. Yes.

30:53.159 --> 30:55.591
Come on.
Good boy.

31:32.909 --> 31:34.973
Yo!

31:38.009 --> 31:41.007
Faster! Faster!

31:41.075 --> 31:46.274
Ho-ho-ho! Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!

31:48.842 --> 31:50.840
Come on, boys.
Come on!

31:50.909 --> 31:53.374
<i>Come on. Don't be afraid.
Come on.</i>

31:54.876 --> 31:57.907
This is it!
Come on!

31:59.876 --> 32:03.174
Ho, ho, ho! Feel the wind
in your faces, boys.

32:22.875 --> 32:24.806
<i>Oh, come on, donner.</i>

32:24.875 --> 32:27.607
There's nothing to worry about.
It's only flying.

32:29.909 --> 32:32.174
"Only flying"?
What am I saying?

32:32.243 --> 32:34.541
<i>All right, boys.</i>
<i>Bank to the right.</i>

32:34.609 --> 32:38.424
Steady!
That's the way!

33:06.226 --> 33:08.525
Come on, boys.
That's my good boys.

33:32.925 --> 33:34.923
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

33:37.443 --> 33:41.573
Oh, more and more are learning to
write now, asking for what they want.

33:41.642 --> 33:43.740
<i>Reading and writing,</i>
<i>writing and reading.</i>

34:06.058 --> 34:10.257
<i>Leave him alone! Don't!</i>
<i>Can't you see he hates it?</i>

34:10.326 --> 34:12.357
Let go! Leave him alone! Don't!

34:12.426 --> 34:14.357
Leave him be!
You're hurting him.

34:14.824 --> 34:16.540
Oh, l-let go!

34:16.609 --> 34:19.956
<i>Come back, you stupid animal!</i>

34:20.025 --> 34:22.024
<i>Come back!</i>

35:07.343 --> 35:10.606
"I am sure he hurts
the poor little kitten,

35:10.675 --> 35:14.474
"and when I cry,
he just laughs at me.

35:14.542 --> 35:17.573
Yours sincerely,
miss Sarah foster."

35:17.642 --> 35:20.174
You were quite right to bring
this to our attention, dooley.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.441
That little boy
must not get a present.

35:22.509 --> 35:25.207
No present for him? Every
child should get a present.

35:25.276 --> 35:28.573
It's time
to change the rules.

35:28.642 --> 35:33.207
You'll have folks saying that Santa claus
only rewards the good little boys and girls.

35:33.276 --> 35:36.074
Isn't that
as it should be?

35:36.143 --> 35:40.274
All right. Dooley,
make up a list...

35:40.343 --> 35:43.307
Of who is naughty and nice.
Yes, sir!

50:37.058 --> 50:41.190
Do you know how to say "yo"?

50:41.258 --> 50:42.772
Yo?

50:59.325 --> 51:02.856
Wow! Oh, wow!

51:10.391 --> 51:13.223
You really <i> are</i> Santa claus,
ain't ya?

51:13.292 --> 51:15.823
Yes. But I still don't
know who <i> you</i> are.

51:15.891 --> 51:19.522
Joe! I'm Joe!
Nice to meet you, Joe.

51:24.358 --> 51:26.789
Wow, neat!
How do you make 'me do it?

51:26.858 --> 51:29.290
Oh, just like a horse and buggy.
Pull their reins.

51:29.358 --> 51:31.755
<i>Both together</i>
<i>to make 'em go higher.</i>

51:31.825 --> 51:34.789
Can they do <i> anything</i> you want?
Oh, yes.

51:34.858 --> 51:38.089
- Well, anything except
the super-dooper looper.

51:38.158 --> 51:40.856
- <i> What's that?</i>
- I've been trying for years.

51:40.925 --> 51:43.823
Well, maybe tonight's
the night!

51:43.891 --> 51:47.755
Come on, donner. Let's give
it that old college try!

51:50.825 --> 51:55.473
-<i> Come on, donner! This may be it! This may be it!</i> 
- Ohh, yahoo!

51:55.541 --> 51:59.173
<i>You can do it, donner!</i>
<i>Come on, boy!</i>

51:59.242 --> 52:02.022
- Here we go!
- Ohh--

52:02.225 --> 52:05.073
you can do it, boy!
I know you can do it!

52:05.141 --> 52:08.373
- <i> Come on!</i>

52:12.691 --> 52:15.823
- <i> Ohh!</i>
- Ohh.

52:18.075 --> 52:21.605
Boy, well,
didn't work again.

52:21.674 --> 52:23.806
That's all right,
donner boy.

52:23.874 --> 52:26.373
<i>We'll get it next time.</i>

52:26.441 --> 52:30.705
Tell 'em it's all right.
Uh, hey, like,

52:30.774 --> 52:32.705
<i>don't sweat it!</i>

52:32.774 --> 52:36.073
<i>You did your best,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

52:42.908 --> 52:45.739
Hey, how would you like
to drive for a while?

52:45.808 --> 52:48.505
Me? Drive?
Sure!

52:48.574 --> 52:51.672
It's easy.
Here! Take the reins.

52:55.908 --> 52:58.973
Well, come on.
Whoa!

52:59.042 --> 53:02.073
<i>Wa-hoo-hoo!</i>

53:02.142 --> 53:04.206
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

53:04.275 --> 53:06.806
How am I doin'?
Oh, great.

53:10.242 --> 53:13.240
- Ohh!
- <i> Come on, guys, go!</i>

53:13.309 --> 53:15.823
Oh, no. No! Hey, wait a minute!
Come on, guys. Go!

53:15.891 --> 53:18.089
Wait a minute! Oh!
Oh! Go, go, go!

53:18.158 --> 53:20.356
Watch out! Oh!
Wait a minute!

53:22.358 --> 53:24.655
Wait a second.
Oh, oh, my!

53:24.724 --> 53:26.856
What do you call them?

53:26.925 --> 53:29.555
Reindeer. No, I mean,
what's their names?

53:29.624 --> 53:31.622
Oh.
Startin' from the front,

53:31.691 --> 53:33.989
<i>that's</i>
<i>donner and blitzen.</i>

53:34.058 --> 53:37.173
<i>Comet and cupid,</i>
<i>prancer and dancer,</i>

53:37.241 --> 53:40.673
<i>then dasher and ViXen. Look.
There's the Brooklyn bridge.</i>

53:40.741 --> 53:43.372
Here we go! Come on, donner.
Come on!

53:43.441 --> 53:47.639
- <i> Oh-h-h-h!</i>
<i>- Whoo! Whoo, whoo!</i>

53:47.942 --> 53:49.589
Go, go!

53:52.524 --> 53:55.173
<i>Let's go get it!</i>
<i>Come on, donner!</i>

53:55.474 --> 53:57.755
<i>Come on, blitzen!</i>
<i>Go, guys, go, go!</i>

53:57.825 --> 54:01.588
<i>- Come on, donner.</i>
<i>- You can do it.</i>

54:01.657 --> 54:03.489
<i>Come on, go, go!</i>

54:03.691 --> 54:06.206
Oh, boy.

54:15.608 --> 54:17.290
I better
take 'em now, Joe.

54:17.357 --> 54:20.989
Where are we going? Well,
we can't joyride all night.

54:21.058 --> 54:23.889
I've got a job
to do, you know?

54:23.958 --> 54:27.056
Oh, yeah!

54:35.541 --> 54:38.505
Is this the kid
who lives here?

54:38.575 --> 54:41.040
Yep.
What'd he get?

54:41.108 --> 54:43.040
Fishing rod.
How come?

54:43.108 --> 54:46.372
That's what he asked for
in his letter.

54:46.441 --> 54:48.773
You mean, if a kid writes--

54:48.841 --> 54:53.190
- anything he wants? - Joe, didn't
you ever write me a letter?

54:53.258 --> 54:56.306
I never believed in--

54:56.374 --> 54:59.639
I mean, hey, I never
needed nothin'.

54:59.707 --> 55:02.522
- See, I usually travel light.
- Well--

55:03.891 --> 55:05.889
let's travel now.

55:32.441 --> 55:35.006
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't see it.

55:46.192 --> 55:49.722
Are you him?

55:49.791 --> 55:51.722
<i>Are you Santa claus?</i>

55:51.791 --> 55:55.388
Boy, I hate it
when this happens.

55:55.457 --> 55:58.156
- Hello, little girl.
- Is this my doll?

55:58.357 --> 56:00.689
Mmm.

56:00.757 --> 56:04.940
- What are <i> you</i> doing here?
- You two know each other.

56:05.008 --> 56:07.672
Oh, sort of.

56:10.241 --> 56:13.472
I'm Cornelia.
I'm Joe.

56:13.541 --> 56:19.022
- I'm Santa claus. - Oh, it's a
great pleasure to meet you, sir.

56:19.224 --> 56:23.205
Would you like some cookies?
They're from bloomingdale's.

56:23.274 --> 56:25.906
Oh.

56:25.975 --> 56:30.372
Chocolate chip.
They're my favorite.

56:30.441 --> 56:33.439
Listen, corny. Thanks for all
the good food you gave me.

56:33.507 --> 56:35.505
I can make you
a bowl of ice cream.

56:35.575 --> 56:39.238
<i>I tell you what, Joe. You stay
here and have something to eat.</i>

56:39.307 --> 56:42.606
- I'll see you again.
- You will? You mean it?

56:42.675 --> 56:45.773
Santa claus
doesn't lie, Joe.

56:45.841 --> 56:49.505
- Next Christmas Eve, we got a date, okay?
- You bet!

56:49.575 --> 56:51.673
Thanks for the cookies.

56:57.991 --> 56:59.855
What a guy.

57:00.191 --> 57:02.439
Excellent.

57:02.507 --> 57:06.123
Come on, now. It's easy.
There you go.

57:09.725 --> 57:13.305
You're doing fine.
Thanks, daddy.

57:13.374 --> 57:17.656
<i>That's it. Oh!</i>

57:17.724 --> 57:20.656
Sweetie pie!

57:30.925 --> 57:35.205
Mom!

57:35.408 --> 57:38.839
- He's a great guy!
- His toys are cheap crap!

57:38.908 --> 57:42.138
His presents suck! What do you care?
Nobody ever gave you nothin'!

57:42.441 --> 57:44.856
How can you be so dumb?

57:44.925 --> 57:47.288
Everyone knows he gives out
shoddy, cheap toys.

57:47.357 --> 57:49.606
My daddy says
he's an old fake.

57:49.674 --> 57:52.806
He is not. He's the nicest
man in the whole world.

57:52.875 --> 57:57.138
My parents gave me a doll, and she
says whole sentences on a cassette.

57:57.207 --> 57:59.972
You don't have any
parents, so naaah! Ow!

58:00.041 --> 58:05.089
- A fight! - Girls! No way
can dancers be angry.

58:21.224 --> 58:23.455
<i>Returns are coming back</i>
<i>from everywhere.</i>

58:23.524 --> 58:26.255
<i>Returns? We've</i>
<i>never had returns.</i>

58:26.324 --> 58:30.189
Maybe we could put out
some kind of statement.

58:30.257 --> 58:32.422
<i>Hi.</i>

58:36.024 --> 58:39.322
Well, I've got
a lot to do.

58:47.924 --> 58:49.889
The thing--

58:49.957 --> 58:52.889
I never was--
you see, I wanted-

58:52.957 --> 58:55.955
being tied down to a desk
suits some elves, you know,

58:56.024 --> 58:59.955
but others of us
are more free-spirited.

59:00.024 --> 59:03.022
I know you had no idea.
I know that.

59:10.691 --> 59:12.722
Patch, how can I say this?

59:12.791 --> 59:17.889
<i>Yeah, I think that,</i>
<i>um... red--</i>

59:18.357 --> 59:22.272
red just, just isn't
my color, you know?

59:31.757 --> 59:35.105
Congratulations!

59:43.942 --> 59:47.806
He'll never have an assistant
as good as me.

59:47.874 --> 59:52.372
Let's face it,
he just doesn't like me.

59:56.174 --> 01:00:00.755
<i>Well, boys, I'm gonna miss you.</i>
<i>You know that, don't you?</i>

01:00:22.308 --> 01:00:24.689
Take care of yourself, huh?

01:01:13.708 --> 01:01:18.172
Now, sir, I'm asking you if this toy
here was manufactured by your company,

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:21.272
<i>the b.Z. Toy manufacturing</i>
<i>corporation.</i>

01:01:21.341 --> 01:01:24.538
Um, yes, senator,
this doll appears to be...

01:01:24.607 --> 01:01:28.339
One of our own Betty beauties.

01:01:33.708 --> 01:01:37.004
Holy crap!
My goodness!

01:01:42.858 --> 01:01:45.222
Well, what do you say
to that, sir?

01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:47.789
Well, senator, I've always
known that cigarette smoking...

01:01:47.858 --> 01:01:51.089
Could be hazardous
to your health.

01:01:51.157 --> 01:01:54.022
This is not a laughing matter, sir.
This is a tragedy!

01:01:54.091 --> 01:01:56.489
You, sir, are a disgrace
to your profession.

01:01:56.557 --> 01:01:59.022
Um, senator,
with all due respect--

01:01:59.091 --> 01:02:04.839
and, I believe, this toy is advertised
as being suitable for three-year-olds.

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:11.855
Oh, my goodness!

01:02:11.923 --> 01:02:16.755
Um, senator, I'm even
more astonished...

01:02:16.824 --> 01:02:21.405
Than you are to see this, and I can guarantee
that if these are not isolated examples,

01:02:21.474 --> 01:02:25.072
I'll make sure that
they never happen again.

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.222
<i>Well, you better do</i>
<i>more than that, sir.</i>

01:02:27.291 --> 01:02:29.622
You better withdraw
every b.Z. Toy on the market,

01:02:29.691 --> 01:02:34.555
<i>or I'll personally see to it that your license
to manufacture in the United States is revoked.</i>

01:02:34.991 --> 01:02:38.723
No comment!

01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:41.623
Okay, towser,
give it to me straight.

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:46.022
The retail outfits are pulling our
toys off the shelves. Cowards!

01:02:46.091 --> 01:02:49.623
The <i> post</i> said that anyone who gives his kid
a b.Z. Toy should have his head examined.

01:02:49.691 --> 01:02:52.623
Swine!
Cancel my subscription.

01:02:52.691 --> 01:02:56.623
We've got to meet a payroll by the end
of the month for 2,000 factory workers.

01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:59.623
Commies! And our cash flow
is flowing the wrong way.

01:02:59.691 --> 01:03:02.805
Right down the toilet. You sure
know how to cheer a guy up.

01:03:02.873 --> 01:03:04.972
What'll we do, b.Z.?

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:09.255
Patch gone? Where will he go?
What will he do?

01:03:10.524 --> 01:03:12.955
The world is no place
for an elf.

01:03:13.024 --> 01:03:15.622
The world's a nice enough
place, isn't it?

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:19.189
I mean, they send such nice
letters from there. It must be.

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:53.788
Good morning, Mr. grizzard.
Everything okay?

01:03:53.857 --> 01:03:55.988
Fine.

01:04:10.191 --> 01:04:13.122
Greetings. Who the
hell-- miss abruzzi!

01:04:13.191 --> 01:04:16.322
Don't bother with that. I'll just vanish.
You'll what?

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:19.522
Vanish... like this.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.588
Hello?

01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:25.555
Hi.
Wha--

01:04:25.624 --> 01:04:28.855
it's a bit uncomfortable
in here. Oh!

01:04:33.691 --> 01:04:37.189
Over here!

01:04:37.257 --> 01:04:40.088
How did you do that?

01:04:40.157 --> 01:04:42.689
Listen.
You make toys, right?

01:04:42.756 --> 01:04:46.155
Are you, uh... from the
federal trade commission?

01:04:46.224 --> 01:04:48.422
No. I'm
from the north pole.

01:04:48.490 --> 01:04:52.122
I've got enough on my mind without
having to deal with an escaped lunatic!

01:04:52.191 --> 01:04:54.955
How do you know I escaped?
What are you?

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:57.555
Isn't it elf-explanatory?
How's that?

01:04:57.624 --> 01:04:59.555
I'm an elf.
An elf?

01:04:59.624 --> 01:05:01.822
Yes.
You mean, like a fairy?

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:04.388
No, I'm not a fairy.
I'm an elf.

01:05:04.457 --> 01:05:07.022
But-but... why are you here?

01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:09.888
Well, I gather
you're a great toy giver.

01:05:09.957 --> 01:05:13.022
I'm a great toy maker. We should get
together. Why should I do that?

01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:16.688
Heaven helps those
who help their elf.

01:05:16.756 --> 01:05:19.688
But-but-but why me?
Because I want to help you.

01:05:19.756 --> 01:05:23.754
Why? So Santa claus
will appreciate me.

01:05:23.824 --> 01:05:27.022
I was right.
You are a lunatic.

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:30.855
Don't you believe
in Santa claus?

01:05:30.924 --> 01:05:34.822
Why should I? He never
brought me anything.

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:38.888
That's because you were
probably a naughty boy.

01:05:38.957 --> 01:05:43.588
Yes... I guess
I was no angel.

01:05:47.656 --> 01:05:50.988
Well, what did you
have in mind, elf?

01:05:51.057 --> 01:05:54.622
Just let me use your toy factory.
To make what?

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:57.788
Something special. Now,
here's the idea. Mm-hmm.

01:05:57.857 --> 01:06:01.788
First of all, you stop making
all your regular toys.

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:04.888
Well, I'm sure they're
fine and dandy, dandy and fine.

01:06:04.957 --> 01:06:07.055
But we won't
be needing them anymore.

01:06:07.124 --> 01:06:09.588
Won't... be...
Needing them anymore?

01:06:09.656 --> 01:06:12.155
No. Oh, uh,
tell me something.

01:06:12.224 --> 01:06:15.289
How can I tell all the people
about my something special?

01:06:15.357 --> 01:06:18.388
Advertise. Advertise?
How do I do that?

01:06:18.457 --> 01:06:21.555
In my line,
television works best.

01:06:21.623 --> 01:06:26.289
Oh, I know! Those little picture
box thingies? Can we get on those?

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:29.955
With enough money, a horse in a
hoop skirt can get on one of those.

01:06:30.023 --> 01:06:32.688
Money. I don't know
much about that.

01:06:32.757 --> 01:06:35.589
Good.
Oh.

01:06:35.657 --> 01:06:38.472
Let's, um, keep it
that way, huh?

01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:41.805
Okay, but you'll fix it so I can
get on the telly? Yeah. When?

01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:43.905
Christmas Eve.
How long?

01:06:43.973 --> 01:06:45.938
Is a minute all right?
What channel?

01:06:46.007 --> 01:06:48.738
- Well, all of them.
- Which countries?

01:06:48.807 --> 01:06:51.771
<i>All of them. All the countries,</i>
<i>all the channels.</i>

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.539
That would cost
a fortune!

01:06:56.374 --> 01:07:00.272
If you give extra kisses,
you get bigger hugs.

01:07:00.341 --> 01:07:04.138
- Sorry? - That's what Santa's
wife is always saying.

01:07:04.208 --> 01:07:06.971
<i>Anyway...</i>

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:10.138
That's all the advertising
you'll ever need.

01:07:10.208 --> 01:07:14.605
It better be. How many workers does this...
product require?

01:07:14.674 --> 01:07:17.339
Just me.
Wha-- no payroll?

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:21.339
A bowl of stew, heavy on the
dill, a cold place to sleep.

01:07:21.408 --> 01:07:23.705
What would it cost?
Cost? Cost who?

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:25.705
The people
who buy the toy.

01:07:25.773 --> 01:07:28.672
Well, nothing. We're going
to give them away free.

01:07:32.274 --> 01:07:36.605
Oh, that's fantastic! How do you
turn your face so red so fast?

01:07:36.674 --> 01:07:39.905
- For free? - Well, that's how
we do it at the north pole.

01:07:40.208 --> 01:07:42.221
Well, that's not
how we do it here!

01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:45.022
<i>In a free enterprise</i>
<i>system--</i>

01:07:46.656 --> 01:07:50.189
on the other hand,
this would go a long way...

01:07:50.257 --> 01:07:53.122
Towards cleaning up
my public image.

01:07:53.191 --> 01:07:56.554
Excuse me? That's not
a bad investment.

01:07:56.623 --> 01:08:00.488
All that good p.R.

01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:05.587
I'm intrigued. Excuse me.
You're drooling on your tie.

01:08:05.656 --> 01:08:08.289
Yes, I know. I said I was
intrigued, didn't I?

01:08:08.357 --> 01:08:14.122
Now listen, son, what experience
do you have in toy manufacture?

01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:18.255
Come on. I'm entirely
elf-taught.

01:08:18.323 --> 01:08:21.388
Uh-huh.
What about it, b.Z.

01:08:21.457 --> 01:08:23.754
This product of yours--

01:08:23.823 --> 01:08:27.288
this, uh,
something special--

01:08:27.357 --> 01:08:30.022
what exactly is it?

01:08:31.323 --> 01:08:34.455
It's something that's very
easy to make. Uh-huh.

01:08:34.523 --> 01:08:36.621
It's cheap.
Uh-huh.

01:08:36.689 --> 01:08:38.621
It's simple.
Uh-huh.

01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:41.122
You can turn them out by
the thousands. Uh-huh.

01:08:41.191 --> 01:08:44.754
And--
yes. And?

01:08:44.823 --> 01:08:47.487
It's got a secret
ingredient.

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:55.339
Look around you!
No strikes, no smelly workers!

01:08:55.408 --> 01:08:58.339
No payroll!
It's practically paradise!

01:08:58.408 --> 01:09:01.470
Still, giving this toy away
for free-- that, Dr. towser,

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:06.005
is why I am a captain of industry and
you are an insignificant schlepper.

01:09:06.073 --> 01:09:08.572
Sure, the first Christmas,
it's free.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.537
But the next one, we say,
"so you want it again?

01:09:11.607 --> 01:09:14.537
Bigger? Better? Well, this
time it's gonna cost you!"

01:09:14.607 --> 01:09:17.305
How much? I don't know.
One hundred, two hundred.

01:09:17.374 --> 01:09:21.305
Where will they get that kind of money?
What do I care?

01:09:21.374 --> 01:09:25.770
Ahh, it's a wonderful thing,
cracking your knuckles.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.904
It's the pleasantest sound in the world.
What's he building in there?

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:34.020
<i>I'm not sure. He says</i>
<i>it's the delivery system.</i>

01:09:36.807 --> 01:09:40.072
Yes? We brought the
prototypes for, uh... it.

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:43.971
Let me see them.
Towser. Towser!

01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:47.872
<i>That one.</i>

01:09:47.941 --> 01:09:50.738
What color? What
color do you like?

01:09:50.807 --> 01:09:52.837
I like puce.
You would!

01:09:52.907 --> 01:09:55.305
What's puce?
It's like fuchsia,

01:09:55.374 --> 01:09:57.504
but a shade less lavender
and a bit more pink.

01:09:57.574 --> 01:09:59.638
Sometimes
I wonder about you.

01:09:59.707 --> 01:10:03.072
Fine. Puce, then. As long as it
tastes good. But are you gonna--

01:10:05.523 --> 01:10:08.955
if this catches on, we can come
out with a liquid version.

01:10:09.023 --> 01:10:12.088
Puce juice.

01:10:20.824 --> 01:10:23.455
Oh, my!
An elf-portrait.

01:10:23.523 --> 01:10:25.621
You haven't made
one of those since--

01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:29.888
it's for Joe. He never
got a present in his life,

01:10:29.957 --> 01:10:32.121
and he's too proud
to ask for one.

01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:34.221
Mm-hmm.

01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:39.055
He makes me think what our son
might've been like, Anya.

01:10:43.857 --> 01:10:47.488
Why, it's patch!

01:10:47.557 --> 01:10:50.387
It's not patch--

01:10:50.457 --> 01:10:53.155
well, I guess it does
resemble--

01:10:56.523 --> 01:10:59.055
my good old patch.

01:10:59.123 --> 01:11:03.305
I don't know about this. It isn't what
the north pole looks like at all.

01:11:03.373 --> 01:11:06.571
Look, b.Z. Knows what he's doing.
He knows how to grab the people.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.938
This isn't real. The public doesn't
want reality. They want the dream.

01:11:10.007 --> 01:11:13.971
Patch! Match!
Patch! Match!

01:11:14.041 --> 01:11:15.971
♪ Someone new
has come to town ♪

01:11:16.041 --> 01:11:19.638
Patch! Patch! <i>From the old north
pole where the elves make toys,</i>

01:11:19.707 --> 01:11:22.755
here's a Christmas treat
for you girls and boys.

01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:26.721
<i>Oh, my name's patch.</i>
<i>As you can tell,</i>

01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:30.371
<i>I'm an elf myself,</i>
<i>so let's give a yell.</i>

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.854
Patch!

01:11:32.923 --> 01:11:35.655
<i>Well, the patch-work present</i>
<i>comes from me.</i>

01:11:35.723 --> 01:11:38.121
You'll find it
under the Christmas tree.

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:42.488
And best of all, you will agree,
is that it's absolutely free.

01:11:42.556 --> 01:11:46.288
Cornelia, your step-Uncle has
just dropped by for a minute.

01:11:46.356 --> 01:11:49.488
Go in and wish him
a merry Christmas.

01:11:53.706 --> 01:11:56.039
<i>Come in.</i>

01:11:59.706 --> 01:12:01.671
Merry Christmas, Uncle.

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:05.938
It certainly should be.

01:12:06.007 --> 01:12:08.304
A little puce candy.

01:12:10.074 --> 01:12:12.438
This special broadcast...

01:12:12.507 --> 01:12:15.205
<i>Is brought to you</i>
<i>by b.Z. Toys.</i>

01:12:15.273 --> 01:12:18.139
- At least he's all right.
- What are you going to do?

01:12:18.207 --> 01:12:20.304
<i>It's Christmas Eve,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

01:12:20.373 --> 01:12:24.571
I'm gonna do my job...
The way I always do.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.105
<i>Merry Christmas</i>
<i>from b.Z. Toys!</i>

01:12:38.024 --> 01:12:41.156
- Where is it?
- Up there, sir.

01:13:08.807 --> 01:13:10.938
That's the stuff
I told you about.

01:13:11.007 --> 01:13:13.471
Yes, it's terrific.
Well done, b.Z.!

01:13:51.273 --> 01:13:54.155
Knock 'em dead, kid!
Knock 'em dead!

01:13:57.473 --> 01:14:01.955
<i>Come on, patch!</i>
<i>Give it all you got, kid!</i>

01:14:17.907 --> 01:14:20.738
Yaaaaa-hoo!

01:14:20.807 --> 01:14:23.938
Oh! Oh.

01:14:56.557 --> 01:14:58.921
Santa!

01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:01.555
At least somebody
down there likes me.

01:15:12.524 --> 01:15:14.888
Easy, boys.
Easy, now.

01:15:14.957 --> 01:15:16.955
<i>Easy, boys.</i>

01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:20.655
Whoa!

01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:29.488
- Hello, Joe.
- Hey, how's it goin'?

01:15:30.991 --> 01:15:33.655
Not bad.
Yourself?

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:40.022
I'm okay, I guess. I was afraid
you'd forget about me.

01:15:46.857 --> 01:15:49.788
Well...

01:15:49.857 --> 01:15:53.104
At least I've got
one good friend left.

01:15:53.172 --> 01:15:57.555
Are you kidding? I'm your
pal for life! Honest!

01:15:57.624 --> 01:16:01.321
<i>Oh, hey, there was this weird
guy on television. Some patch--</i>

01:16:01.524 --> 01:16:04.271
I know about that.
That's all right.

01:16:04.339 --> 01:16:06.905
Then it's cool, then?
Yeah.

01:16:06.973 --> 01:16:10.104
Hiya, blitzen. Hey, donner,
how's it goin', man?

01:16:12.323 --> 01:16:17.504
- Hey, comet!

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:20.805
- All right.
- Coming?

01:16:20.874 --> 01:16:24.070
Neat!

01:16:25.473 --> 01:16:28.304
Oh! I almost forgot.

01:16:35.106 --> 01:16:38.288
- For me?
- For you.

01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:40.855
A present?

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:48.321
Aw, gee, thanks!
Excellent!

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:52.538
Did corny get something?
The, um, little girl.

01:16:52.607 --> 01:16:56.455
Oh! Are you seeing
a lot of each other?

01:16:56.523 --> 01:16:59.921
Actually, yes. Actually.

01:17:00.357 --> 01:17:03.221
Well, of course she's gonna get a present.
She writes a nice letter.

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:06.021
She asked for a toy piano.

01:17:07.457 --> 01:17:11.154
Well, come on.
Huh?

01:17:11.223 --> 01:17:14.654
What about the, uh, "yo"?

01:17:14.723 --> 01:17:17.371
Oh, right. Yo!

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.904
All right, donner!
All right, blitzen!

01:17:19.972 --> 01:17:22.003
All right, everybody!
Ho-ho-ho!

01:17:22.072 --> 01:17:25.104
Here we go! Ha-ha-ha!

01:17:25.172 --> 01:17:27.605
Ho-ho-ho!

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.555
Don't you want to try it?

01:17:38.623 --> 01:17:40.722
I certainly do not.

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:45.020
Well, it would be a shame
to let it go to waste.

01:17:45.089 --> 01:17:48.338
Do you mind if I take it?
I don't care.

01:17:48.406 --> 01:17:51.771
Mmm!

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:54.438
Mmm!

01:17:54.506 --> 01:17:57.504
Ohhh!

01:17:57.573 --> 01:18:01.705
<i>Oh, look at me!</i>
<i>I feel just like Mary poppins!</i>

01:18:05.707 --> 01:18:08.338
<i>Okay, man, come on.</i>
<i>Do your worst, huh?</i>

01:18:08.406 --> 01:18:11.771
<i>Come on. You can't get past me,</i>
<i>sucker. Come on! Come on!</i>

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.054
Oh, yeah,
you can't get past me.

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:17.355
<i>Kid, come on, give me that ball!
Hey, what you doin'?</i>

01:18:17.423 --> 01:18:19.237
Hey!

01:18:19.306 --> 01:18:22.838
Wow! I don't believe it!

01:18:23.139 --> 01:18:26.355
You're cute.

01:18:44.773 --> 01:18:48.021
Here he is,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:49.937
The man of the hour.
Ask him anything.

01:18:50.006 --> 01:18:52.654
Tell us how you make it.
Can you, please?

01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:54.705
What's in the lollipops,
Mr. patch?

01:18:54.773 --> 01:18:57.920
Well, it's--
all natural ingredients.

01:18:57.989 --> 01:19:01.488
- No additives whatsoever.
- Who did your outfit?

01:19:01.556 --> 01:19:04.920
Uh, goober, actually. He's
head of the sewing department.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:07.455
Mr. patch, has the space
agency contacted you yet?

01:19:07.523 --> 01:19:09.971
Who?
<i>The astronauts.</i>

01:19:10.039 --> 01:19:12.988
Oh. No, they'll have
to write to Santa claus...

01:19:13.056 --> 01:19:15.321
<i>Just like the other</i>
<i>boys and girls.</i>

01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:18.554
Uh, what we want--
what we want...

01:19:18.623 --> 01:19:21.920
Is to bring joy
and happiness...

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:24.970
To all the little children
of this world.

01:19:25.039 --> 01:19:27.638
And that's why
I'm proud to announce...

01:19:27.707 --> 01:19:31.754
That, beginning today,
my pal patch here...

01:19:31.822 --> 01:19:34.605
Is exclusive with b.Z. Toys!

01:19:34.673 --> 01:19:38.104
What about the fact that the senate
subcommittee on toy safety...

01:19:38.172 --> 01:19:41.870
Cited this company
with 15 separate--

01:19:41.939 --> 01:19:44.538
no more questions!

01:19:44.607 --> 01:19:46.920
No more questions.
No more questions.

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:49.754
What's this about the senate subcommittee?
Just typical newspaper garbage.

01:19:49.822 --> 01:19:53.321
Don't take it seriously. And what was
that business about our future plans?

01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:56.254
The future is ours, patch.

01:19:56.323 --> 01:19:59.654
But I'm going back to the north pole.
Says who?

01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:03.438
Well, nobody yet. But now Santa
claus has seen what I can do.

01:20:03.506 --> 01:20:05.738
I'm sure he's gonna send
for me to come home.

01:20:05.805 --> 01:20:09.937
Why would you want to do that? What does
the north pole have that New York doesn't?

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:12.837
Ice and polar bears--

01:20:13.273 --> 01:20:15.920
and Santa claus
and my friends.

01:20:16.357 --> 01:20:19.088
All right, all right.
I'll tell you what.

01:20:19.156 --> 01:20:22.787
Just do me one favor
before you go.

01:20:22.856 --> 01:20:26.237
- No, I can't. I've gotta go back.
- No, no, no, no.

01:20:26.306 --> 01:20:30.071
Not for me.
For them, patch.

01:20:31.873 --> 01:20:34.921
- Well, who?
- Am I right?

01:20:36.323 --> 01:20:39.254
Something...

01:20:39.323 --> 01:20:42.654
Something for them.

01:20:42.723 --> 01:20:45.387
Something
for all the children...

01:20:45.456 --> 01:20:48.921
Of this miserable old world.

01:20:51.123 --> 01:20:54.121
So how about it?
Will you do it?

01:20:54.190 --> 01:20:58.487
What is it? This stardust--
this reindeer cornflakes--

01:20:58.556 --> 01:21:01.621
whatever it is that made
the children walk on air--

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:05.621
wh-wh-what would happen if you were
to juice up the formula a bit?

01:21:05.690 --> 01:21:07.621
Just make it stronger?

01:21:07.690 --> 01:21:10.921
Well, it's elf-explanatory.
I mean, it would make them fly.

01:21:10.989 --> 01:21:13.987
Yeah, fly.
Fly? Fly? Fly?

01:21:14.056 --> 01:21:18.954
You mean, like, fly?
Like fly high in the sky.

01:21:19.023 --> 01:21:23.054
And could you do that before you go?
Yes, but I--

01:21:23.123 --> 01:21:27.054
patch. It wouldn't
take you long, would it?

01:21:27.123 --> 01:21:29.787
Lollipops?
No, no!

01:21:29.856 --> 01:21:32.887
No, we did that already.
That's yesterday's news.

01:21:32.956 --> 01:21:35.487
The consumer needs
a new model.

01:21:35.556 --> 01:21:38.921
Well... candy canes?

01:21:40.323 --> 01:21:43.254
Candy canes.
Mm-hmm.

01:21:43.323 --> 01:21:47.655
Of course. Patch!
You are some terrific elf!

01:21:47.722 --> 01:21:51.687
I mean, I could convert the--
I could convert the machines...

01:21:51.755 --> 01:21:54.238
To do candy canes, and in a week
or two, and then I suppose--

01:21:54.307 --> 01:21:57.621
<i>we can launch the ad campaign tomorrow.
Strike while the iron is hot!</i>

01:21:57.689 --> 01:22:00.971
I can promise delivery
in, say, three months.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.138
Three months?
But it's a year to Christmas.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.454
When you've got a hit
like we have, patch,

01:22:05.523 --> 01:22:09.853
the people don't want to wait a whole
year; They're dying for a sequel!

01:22:09.922 --> 01:22:13.521
A sequel.
That's it.

01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:16.421
We'll bring it out
on march 25,

01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:18.920
and we'll call it...

01:22:21.755 --> 01:22:24.221
Christmas ii!

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:27.405
Christmas ii?

01:22:27.473 --> 01:22:31.104
Maybe the whole idea
is no good anymore.

01:22:31.173 --> 01:22:35.004
What are you talking about?
What idea?

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.637
Christmas.

01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:42.305
Claus!

01:22:44.373 --> 01:22:48.004
The world is a different
place now, Anya.

01:22:48.073 --> 01:22:50.438
You don't see it.

01:22:50.506 --> 01:22:53.504
The people
don't seem to care...

01:22:53.573 --> 01:22:56.837
About giving a gift...

01:22:56.906 --> 01:23:01.837
Just so they can see the light
of happiness in a friend's eyes.

01:23:01.906 --> 01:23:04.004
<i>Just--</i>

01:23:04.073 --> 01:23:07.837
<i>just doesn't feel</i>
<i>like Christmas anymore.</i>

01:23:10.506 --> 01:23:16.371
Maybe this fellow b.Z.
Is smarter than I am.

01:23:18.973 --> 01:23:20.971
Maybe I'm--

01:23:23.006 --> 01:23:26.471
maybe I'm just
an old fool.

01:24:06.722 --> 01:24:08.921
<i>Hi.</i>

01:24:08.989 --> 01:24:11.887
<i>Hi. Come up, quick.</i>

01:25:08.006 --> 01:25:10.938
You're burning up!
I'll be all right.

01:25:11.006 --> 01:25:14.405
You stay out there, and you'll
be dead is what you'll be.

01:25:15.906 --> 01:25:18.305
You're staying here!

01:25:18.373 --> 01:25:21.703
I'm what? There's an empty
room in the basement.

01:25:21.772 --> 01:25:24.438
Nobody ever goes down there.

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:29.438
Oh, please, Joe.
Just till you get better.

01:25:30.906 --> 01:25:34.637
Well... all right.

01:25:34.705 --> 01:25:37.570
But just till I shake this.

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:04.603
It's, uh, a new doll.

01:26:07.206 --> 01:26:09.637
A doll.

01:26:09.705 --> 01:26:12.971
Children ought to like it.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.804
Does it fly?

01:26:15.872 --> 01:26:19.938
It, uh... wets.

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:52.238
Towser! Good lord, man!
3:00 in the morning!

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:55.703
Haven't you ever heard of the telephone?
I couldn't use the phone.

01:26:55.772 --> 01:27:00.470
It's perfectly easy, towser. You just pick up
the receiver and dial all the little numbers.

01:27:00.539 --> 01:27:02.637
I didn't dare
use the phone, b.Z.

01:27:02.705 --> 01:27:05.637
I couldn't take the chance of
anyone hearing. Hearing what?

01:27:05.705 --> 01:27:07.804
Shhh!
Hearing what?

01:27:07.872 --> 01:27:11.837
Are we alone? My niece and
her nanny are fast asleep.

01:27:11.906 --> 01:27:15.004
All right. Good.
Come on. Come on.

01:27:15.073 --> 01:27:17.071
Here.

01:27:21.973 --> 01:27:25.004
Ninety-nine.
You still have a temperature.

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:27.938
Four dopey points!
Big deal!

01:27:28.006 --> 01:27:31.138
More liquids. That's what you need.
More vitamin c.

01:27:31.206 --> 01:27:34.087
Come on. Let's go get
some orange juice.

01:27:39.372 --> 01:27:43.938
<i>Oh, towser, with you it's</i>
<i>always some new melodrama.</i>

01:27:44.006 --> 01:27:48.120
<i>Well, let me tell you, my friend,
tonight, nothing can upset me.</i>

01:27:48.190 --> 01:27:52.453
The money's coming in so fast, you'd
think we were printing it ourselves!

01:27:52.522 --> 01:27:54.637
But, but, b.Z.--

01:27:54.706 --> 01:27:57.304
do you realize
what this means, man?

01:27:57.372 --> 01:28:00.637
Santa claus is finished!

01:28:02.973 --> 01:28:06.620
<i>I'm taking over Christmas.</i>
<i>By next December,</i>

01:28:06.689 --> 01:28:09.188
they'll be writing to me!

01:28:09.256 --> 01:28:12.387
B.Z.

01:28:18.190 --> 01:28:22.087
What the hell--

01:28:24.955 --> 01:28:28.221
towser, take that way!
Oh! Oh!

01:28:33.589 --> 01:28:36.504
Come on with me, young man!
Let me go!

01:28:36.572 --> 01:28:41.171
<i>How did you get in here? Who
are you, anyway? Let me go!</i>

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:46.621
<i>Towser! Towser!</i>

01:28:46.689 --> 01:28:49.621
- You little brat!
- Who is this kid?

01:28:49.689 --> 01:28:53.254
- Some damned little sneak!
- I heard what you said!

01:28:53.322 --> 01:28:55.954
<i>You ain't never gonna</i>
<i>beat Santa claus! Never!</i>

01:28:56.023 --> 01:28:59.987
<i>I'll tell him, and he'll beat you!
</i> Park this kid on ice!

01:29:00.190 --> 01:29:04.354
I'll deal with him later.

01:29:13.206 --> 01:29:15.370
Shut up!

01:29:23.806 --> 01:29:25.621
B.Z., we've got to talk.

01:29:25.689 --> 01:29:29.454
Have you ever had one of those nights
when you just want to drop a bomb?

01:29:29.523 --> 01:29:32.920
Some damn kid in my basement, you waltzing
into the house in the middle of the night--

01:29:32.989 --> 01:29:35.721
by the way, towser, what the
hell did you want, anyway?

01:29:36.056 --> 01:29:39.237
It's the candy canes. They're dangerous.
What about 'em?

01:29:39.305 --> 01:29:42.155
What the hell are you talking about?
This patch guy--

01:29:42.222 --> 01:29:45.121
he told me he keeps that secret
ingredient in cold storage...

01:29:45.190 --> 01:29:48.155
<i>Because it comes from the north pole.
</i> Uh-huh.

01:29:48.222 --> 01:29:50.270
So we started manufacturing
the candy canes. <i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:29:50.338 --> 01:29:52.737
- It's a very powerful mixture, you know?
- Uh-huh.

01:29:52.806 --> 01:29:56.771
<i>So I just assumed I should refrigerate
them too.</i> Get on with your story!

01:29:56.839 --> 01:30:00.404
<i>Stop giving me all these short sentences and
making me go "uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh"..</i>

01:30:00.472 --> 01:30:03.104
Like some kind of a moron!
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:30:03.406 --> 01:30:07.320
I had to move one of the batches of candy
canes to another part of the factory.

01:30:07.389 --> 01:30:09.621
<i>I left a box next</i>
<i>to a radiator in the lab.</i>

01:30:09.689 --> 01:30:12.454
- And?
- There's no more lab.

01:30:12.656 --> 01:30:15.453
<i>The candy canes</i>
<i>exploded!</i>

01:30:15.523 --> 01:30:18.420
<i>They react to extreme heat</i>
<i>and turn volatile.</i>

01:30:18.489 --> 01:30:22.521
<i>We've got to stop this.
</i> Stop? Are you insane?

01:30:24.288 --> 01:30:27.921
<i>We've got millions of dollars pouring
in every day, most of it in cash.</i>

01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:33.721
<i>Cash, man!</i>
<i>Small, unmarked bills.</i>

01:30:33.789 --> 01:30:36.587
B.Z., this stuff
can kill people.

01:30:36.656 --> 01:30:39.320
Are you going soft on me?
No, I'm not going--

01:30:39.389 --> 01:30:42.537
listen, you idiot.
Who else knows about this?

01:30:42.606 --> 01:30:44.837
Nobody.
What about patch?

01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:47.804
He was asleep.
He didn't hear anything.

01:30:47.873 --> 01:30:50.270
Don't tell him.

01:30:50.338 --> 01:30:53.904
Don't tell anybody.

01:30:53.972 --> 01:30:57.804
B.Z., these are children
we're talking about.

01:30:57.873 --> 01:31:03.470
Yes. And who appreciates
them better than I?

01:31:03.539 --> 01:31:08.153
These... industrious
little boys and girls...

01:31:08.222 --> 01:31:11.821
<i>Saving all their</i>
<i>nickels and dimes...</i>

01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:15.754
<i>To get the magic candy canes</i>
<i>I promised them.</i>

01:31:15.823 --> 01:31:18.888
<i>They'll get</i>
<i>what they paid for.</i>

01:31:18.956 --> 01:31:22.888
<i>If these people are so reckless as
to have radiators in their houses--</i>

01:31:22.956 --> 01:31:25.021
reckless?
Towser,

01:31:25.089 --> 01:31:27.420
how does Brazil
sound to you?

01:31:27.489 --> 01:31:29.420
Brazil?
Brazil.

01:31:29.489 --> 01:31:33.353
Sandy beaches,
tropical breezes,

01:31:33.422 --> 01:31:37.353
big rum drinks
with pineapple in them,

01:31:37.422 --> 01:31:41.253
senoritas
in string bikinis,

01:31:41.322 --> 01:31:46.387
and-- oh, yes--
no extradition proceedings.

01:31:46.455 --> 01:31:49.654
You mean--
you and me, Eric.

01:31:49.723 --> 01:31:52.253
We'll take the cash...

01:31:52.322 --> 01:31:55.587
And let the elf
face the music.

01:32:19.805 --> 01:32:22.921
Listen, kid. You wanna
die on me when I'm gone?

01:32:22.989 --> 01:32:25.687
Be my guest.

01:32:27.689 --> 01:32:31.320
<i>Dear Santa, you've gotta help.</i>

01:32:31.388 --> 01:32:34.070
<i>Joe's been taken prisoner</i>
<i>by a very bad man.</i>

01:32:34.138 --> 01:32:36.637
<i>I'm sorry to say</i>
<i>he's a relation of mine.</i>

01:32:36.706 --> 01:32:40.303
Cornelia, what are you doing? You're
ten minutes late for breakfast.

01:32:40.372 --> 01:32:42.370
I'm coming.

01:32:59.873 --> 01:33:04.270
Just what I thought.

01:33:06.138 --> 01:33:11.604
<i>I think we should prepare the first shipments
of pine wood as early as April this time.</i>

01:33:11.673 --> 01:33:14.370
Don't you agree, Santa?

01:33:17.372 --> 01:33:20.136
What's this?

01:33:20.205 --> 01:33:22.403
Looks like a letter.
In January?

01:33:22.472 --> 01:33:25.771
A bit early for next
Christmas, isn't it?

01:33:25.839 --> 01:33:28.804
It's familiar writing.

01:33:34.756 --> 01:33:37.921
- Saddle up the reindeer! - But it's
only two weeks since they've been out.

01:33:37.988 --> 01:33:40.103
This can't wait.

01:33:40.172 --> 01:33:42.904
Ah! Just the elves I want to see.
Hitch up the reindeer.

01:33:42.971 --> 01:33:45.969
<i>We're flying out at 1900 hours!
</i> That's what we came to tell you.

01:33:46.038 --> 01:33:48.204
<i>It's comet and cupid.</i>
What about them?

01:33:48.272 --> 01:33:51.237
- They've got flu.

01:33:51.306 --> 01:33:55.270
This would have to happen now. Well,
I'll have to make do with six.

01:33:55.339 --> 01:33:57.370
<i>Get them ready.</i>
<i>Feed them.</i>

01:33:57.439 --> 01:33:59.754
Little Joe needs me.

01:34:01.656 --> 01:34:04.420
<i>But, boys...</i>

01:34:04.489 --> 01:34:08.554
We have got ourselves
one heck of a problem here.

01:34:08.622 --> 01:34:11.854
Our little friend Joe
is in trouble.

01:34:11.923 --> 01:34:16.420
<i>If we don't help him, I don't even
like to think of what can happen.</i>

01:34:21.355 --> 01:34:24.103
Now, listen.

01:34:24.172 --> 01:34:26.936
I know we're two men
short today.

01:34:27.005 --> 01:34:29.437
But this time...

01:34:29.506 --> 01:34:31.704
You've got to fly
like the wind.

01:34:31.772 --> 01:34:35.370
<i>Can you do it for me?</i>

01:34:35.439 --> 01:34:37.936
Can you do it
for little Joe?

01:34:43.772 --> 01:34:46.237
Sure you can!

01:34:51.155 --> 01:34:53.119
- All right, men.

01:34:53.456 --> 01:34:57.370
<i>Give me that extra effort.</i>
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>

01:34:57.439 --> 01:34:59.437
Yo!

01:35:01.739 --> 01:35:06.821
Come on, blitzen!
Come on!

01:35:47.372 --> 01:35:50.136
My gosh!
What are you doing down here?

01:35:50.205 --> 01:35:53.336
As if you didn't know!

01:35:53.405 --> 01:35:55.303
Me?
Yeah, you!

01:35:55.372 --> 01:35:58.870
You ruined Christmas! But I never did.
What are you talking about?

01:35:58.939 --> 01:36:02.103
He said that kids didn't like him no more!
You don't even know Santa claus.

01:36:02.172 --> 01:36:04.103
Do so!
<i>Do not!</i>

01:36:04.172 --> 01:36:06.537
He said I was his only
friend left, you dumb punk!

01:36:06.606 --> 01:36:11.870
But I-- I was just-- I just wanted him
to see what a good assistant I could be.

01:36:11.939 --> 01:36:15.604
He's seen what you are.
You're a dumb, stupid idiot,

01:36:15.673 --> 01:36:18.470
stink-face creep who made the
kids hate the best guy ever!

01:36:18.539 --> 01:36:21.336
Hey, what is this? Give me that!
It's mine!

01:36:21.405 --> 01:36:23.803
Where did you get it?
He gave it to me.

01:36:23.872 --> 01:36:26.803
See, I told you
I was his best friend.

01:36:26.872 --> 01:36:31.136
My elf-portrait.
He does like me after all.

01:36:31.573 --> 01:36:33.704
Huh?
Come on, kid.

01:36:33.772 --> 01:36:36.903
Where are we going? We're
going to the north pole.

01:36:36.971 --> 01:36:41.253
We'll both go. And for once, we'll
bring Santa claus a present.

01:36:44.589 --> 01:36:46.620
It's you!
Thank heavens!

01:36:46.689 --> 01:36:48.620
How is he?
I don't know.

01:36:48.689 --> 01:36:51.819
Where is he? My step-Uncle's got him.
Those candy canes--

01:36:51.888 --> 01:36:54.320
shhh.
Tell me on the way.

01:36:58.205 --> 01:37:01.636
They exploded? That's what they said.
When they got hot.

01:37:01.705 --> 01:37:04.470
I called the police, but
I don't think they believed me.

01:37:04.538 --> 01:37:08.069
We've got to hurry.
Come on, boys!

01:37:08.138 --> 01:37:12.303
Enough here to take care of all next year's
Christmas orders. Santa claus can take a year off.

01:37:12.372 --> 01:37:14.769
His first vacation. Won't that be great?
Yeah, neat.

01:37:14.838 --> 01:37:18.869
Oh, wow!
Yeah, good, huh?

01:37:18.938 --> 01:37:21.637
- <i>Ahhh!</i>
- Put your seat belt on.

01:37:31.855 --> 01:37:35.020
Hey, this is neat!
Yeah.

01:37:38.022 --> 01:37:41.270
It's them! Both of them! Oh, no!

01:37:41.339 --> 01:37:45.036
What is it? Look. The candy canes!
They're in the car with 'em.

01:37:45.105 --> 01:37:47.736
Patch doesn't know
they explode.

01:37:47.804 --> 01:37:51.036
Fly, boys!
Fly like the wind!

01:37:51.105 --> 01:37:54.237
Fly like you've never flown before!
Come on!

01:38:02.322 --> 01:38:04.337
<i>Okay, we know you're up there.</i>

01:38:04.405 --> 01:38:07.136
Now, come on down
with your hands held high!

01:38:07.205 --> 01:38:10.802
<i>Unit 71, are you 10-4?</i>

01:38:13.071 --> 01:38:17.303
Let's go.

01:38:27.038 --> 01:38:29.136
<i>Open up! Police!</i>

01:38:29.205 --> 01:38:33.253
- <i>We know you're in there!</i>
- <i>We'll kick the door!</i>

01:38:33.322 --> 01:38:37.320
- <i> We're comin' in! Hold it!</i>

01:38:40.438 --> 01:38:43.237
Whoa. Whoa!

01:38:43.305 --> 01:38:47.070
Whooooaaaaah!

01:38:47.372 --> 01:38:49.621
What the--

01:38:49.688 --> 01:38:53.603
oh, this is neat!

01:38:53.671 --> 01:38:58.070
I can do anything with
this car I want. Watch.

01:39:16.955 --> 01:39:20.120
- Fly, boys!
- Can't they go any faster?

01:39:20.189 --> 01:39:24.053
They usually get a year's rest.
They're doing their best.

01:39:24.122 --> 01:39:26.853
<i>Fly!</i>
<i>Come on, boys!</i>

01:39:42.155 --> 01:39:44.304
Oh, wow!

01:39:45.688 --> 01:39:47.853
Ohhh!

01:39:53.822 --> 01:39:55.953
Come on!
That's it, boys!

01:39:56.021 --> 01:39:58.270
Come on, now!
Come on!

01:39:59.772 --> 01:40:02.571
That's the way.
That's the way. Come on.

01:40:02.638 --> 01:40:05.937
That's my good boys.
Come on!

01:40:15.405 --> 01:40:17.503
Yippee!

01:40:19.539 --> 01:40:22.736
Oh, my gosh!

01:40:22.805 --> 01:40:25.020
Joe! Joe!

01:40:25.088 --> 01:40:28.253
<i>Come on, boys!</i>
<i>That's patch in there!</i>

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:32.187
If you love him like he loves
you, give it all you got!

01:40:32.255 --> 01:40:34.453
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

01:40:34.522 --> 01:40:37.520
Come on, blitzen!
Come on, donner!

01:40:40.939 --> 01:40:43.303
Can we go higher?
Of course, Joe.

01:40:49.072 --> 01:40:51.304
Something's happening!
Patch! Oh, no!

01:40:59.805 --> 01:41:04.703
Do something! The super-dooper looper.
It's the only way.

01:41:04.771 --> 01:41:07.103
<i>Come on, donner!</i>
<i>You can do it!</i>

01:41:07.172 --> 01:41:10.070
I know you can do it!
Come on! Faster!

01:41:10.138 --> 01:41:12.736
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Faster!</i>

01:41:12.805 --> 01:41:16.270
What's going on?

01:41:16.572 --> 01:41:19.736
Here we go! Hang on!
Here we go!

01:41:23.005 --> 01:41:26.836
Give it all you got!
Come on, now! Come on!

01:41:30.138 --> 01:41:32.204
Hah! Hah!

01:41:32.272 --> 01:41:35.585
<i>Come on, donner!</i>
<i>Come on! You can do it!</i>

01:41:35.654 --> 01:41:37.769
Santa! It's Santa!

01:41:37.838 --> 01:41:40.420
Santa! Aah!

01:41:42.988 --> 01:41:45.853
All right!

01:41:48.022 --> 01:41:50.386
Santa!

01:41:50.456 --> 01:41:53.502
Dash it away, donner!
Dash it away!

01:41:56.555 --> 01:41:58.603
Joe!

01:42:10.222 --> 01:42:13.452
Oh! Oh, my boys!

01:42:13.521 --> 01:42:17.770
<i>I've seen some reindeer in my time,
but you're the best, the best!</i>

01:42:17.838 --> 01:42:20.953
We did it! We did it!
Ha-ha-ha!

01:42:21.021 --> 01:42:23.603
<i>Well done, donner!</i>

01:42:25.705 --> 01:42:28.536
Way to go, donner!

01:42:28.605 --> 01:42:31.570
Patch, this is corny.
Corny, meet patch.

01:42:31.638 --> 01:42:34.886
Hi, corny.
Nice to meet you, patch.

01:42:41.772 --> 01:42:43.836
Yeah.

01:42:49.205 --> 01:42:51.204
What about corny?

01:42:55.406 --> 01:42:59.803
Can I stay? Just till next Christmas.
Please?

01:42:59.871 --> 01:43:04.036
And you can give her
a lift home next year.

01:43:04.105 --> 01:43:06.803
<i>Well, dooley?</i> As if I
don't have enough to do.

01:43:06.871 --> 01:43:09.103
Now I'm going to have to be
a school teacher.

01:43:09.172 --> 01:43:11.703
School?
School?

01:43:53.105 --> 01:43:56.536
Hey! What's going on?

01:43:56.605 --> 01:43:59.736
