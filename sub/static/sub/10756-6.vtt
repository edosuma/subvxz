FRASIER:
Oh, my God. Breathtaking.

00:12.207 --> 00:14.846
Well, don't be greedy.
Your turn was over 40 seconds ago.

00:15.047 --> 00:18.164
All right, all right, Niles.
There it is. It's the penthouse unit.

00:18.327 --> 00:20.318
- Second window from the right.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.996
Oh, mama.

00:23.367 --> 00:25.642
You two know that what
you're doing isn't right, don't you?

00:25.847 --> 00:29.317
We're simply admiring a rare Brancusi
armchair, not a naked woman.

00:29.607 --> 00:31.199
That's what I'm talking about.

00:34.767 --> 00:36.280
- Oh, hi, Daph.
- Hello, Daphne.

00:36.487 --> 00:38.717
- You're home kind of early, aren't you?
DAPHNE: A bit.

00:38.887 --> 00:41.242
- Something sort of happened.
- Oh, yeah? What?

00:41.407 --> 00:44.160
Well, Joe and I were having dinner.

00:44.327 --> 00:48.161
Everything was nice as could be,
and I said, "Don't you like your potato?"

00:48.327 --> 00:50.887
And he said, "No, I'm not
hungry for potato just now."

00:51.087 --> 00:54.443
I said, "If you don't like your potato,
you're welcome to try my potato."

00:54.607 --> 00:58.441
Daphne, could we hasten to the
post-potato portion of the dialogue?

00:59.847 --> 01:01.803
Well, that's when he said it.

01:02.007 --> 01:04.236
He said we'd been on again,
off again for too long

01:04.407 --> 01:05.920
without making anything permanent.

01:06.087 --> 01:08.885
So maybe it was best
if we just broke up.

01:09.087 --> 01:11.157
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

01:11.527 --> 01:13.165

You're sure taking it well.

01:13.447 --> 01:16.166

would end up dumping you...

Oh, God, he dumped me!

01:19.087 --> 01:21.521
- Somebody comfort her.
- Right.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.766
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

01:27.927 --> 01:30.282
FRASIER: Oh, no, no.
Never mind about that.

01:30.487 --> 01:32.796
Expressing our feelings
is always beneficial.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.959
Even if it does come
at the expense of our pride.

01:36.367 --> 01:40.758
And a very expensive
brand new Italian silk jacket.

01:41.087 --> 01:44.443
I don't seem to be doing much good.
Why don't you give it a try?

01:44.607 --> 01:46.882
Now, Daphne.

01:47.047 --> 01:49.720
That's all right. You're better off
without him. That guy was a bum.

01:49.927 --> 01:51.679
He was the best thing in my life.

01:51.847 --> 01:55.123
Then maybe you two just weren't
meant for each other, you know.

01:55.287 --> 01:59.166

of gal. He's a meat-and-potatoes guy.

- Roz.

02:11.967 --> 02:15.277
Oh, my God. You got dumped.
Ahhh.

02:17.367 --> 02:21.645
- Did you make her answer the door?
- It's what she does.

02:21.847 --> 02:24.361
Oh, it's all right. Come on.

02:24.527 --> 02:26.518
- I'm sorry about this.
- It's all right.

02:26.687 --> 02:29.804
I guess I'm still at the point where
I can't hear his name without crying.

02:30.007 --> 02:32.965
Did you hear that everyone?
No one mentions the name "Joe."

- Mm-hmm.

02:46.247 --> 02:48.158
I think I've just made
an important decision.

02:48.327 --> 02:50.283
I'm going to tell Daphne
how I feel about her.

02:50.447 --> 02:52.165
- What?
- I'm gonna tell her tonight.

02:52.327 --> 02:54.636
- You're serious?
- I am dead serious.

02:54.807 --> 02:57.446
Maris and I are nowhere
near reconciling.

02:57.607 --> 02:59.199
I know this is the right decision

02:59.367 --> 03:01.483
because I'm completely calm
about it. Look.

03:08.567 --> 03:10.637
- Perhaps I'll take that brandy.
- Yes, all right.

03:11.167 --> 03:13.556
Niles, before you do something
this rash,

03:13.727 --> 03:15.957
perhaps you should consider it
from all angles.

03:16.167 --> 03:19.159
I've spent three years considering
Daphne from all angles.

03:21.407 --> 03:23.398
I'm just not sure this is the right timing.

03:23.607 --> 03:25.677
If you're trying to rattle me,
it's not going to work.

03:25.847 --> 03:27.724
I've been rehearsing for months.
Daphne,

03:27.887 --> 03:30.879
there's something I need
to talk to you about. It's a matter of...

Exactly how's the brandy
getting here, by St Bernard?

03:44.447 --> 03:47.166
Niles, I just think you should
consider Daphne's state of mind.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.477
I mean, she's still reeling
from her break-up with Joe.

03:49.807 --> 03:52.321
Listen, why don't you just
give it one more day?

03:52.847 --> 03:55.919
- A day?
- It's just a day. Just one day, please.

03:56.087 --> 03:59.682

Another day won't make a difference.

04:01.607 --> 04:02.960
All right.

Now Daphne, if the jewelry wasn't
that good and the sex wasn't that good,

04:18.487 --> 04:20.238
What were the Sonics

04:20.406 --> 04:23.365
If you're two for 15 behind the arc,
why do you give it to your two guard

04:23.567 --> 04:26.001
instead of jamming it down
to your big man in the paint?

04:27.567 --> 04:30.365
Eddie, I believe that question
was directed at you.

04:33.647 --> 04:36.115

11:24.247 --> 11:25.999
[DOORBELL DINGS]
Nothing.

11:26.167 --> 11:28.886
Just how whenever you think
you have your life figured out,

11:29.047 --> 11:31.800
something unexpected happens.

11:32.647 --> 11:34.877
Sorry. Forgot my keys.
Hello, all.

11:35.047 --> 11:38.164
Oh, everyone, this is Rodney Banks.
NILES: Oh.

11:38.727 --> 11:40.160
Hello.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.925
- Dr Niles Crane.
- How do you do?

11:42.087 --> 11:43.998
The pleasure is mine.

11:50.567 --> 11:52.717
- Flu season.
- Can't be too careful.

11:52.887 --> 11:56.516
Oh, this is Dr Frasier Crane
and his father, Martin.

11:56.687 --> 11:58.564
- Good to see you. Welcome.
- Hi, how are you?

11:58.727 --> 12:00.285
This is Adelle Childs.

12:00.447 --> 12:01.926
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:02.087 --> 12:04.396
Well, we've just had the most
wonderful day at the marina.

12:04.607 --> 12:06.563
- Oh, you got a boat?
- Actually, no.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.878
I have an inner ear curvature that
makes me prone to motion sickness.

12:10.047 --> 12:12.607
But there's a charming bistro there
that serves the most...

12:12.767 --> 12:14.564
[RINGING]

12:18.607 --> 12:20.438
- It's not me.
- Not me.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.280
Hello.
Oh, I can't talk now, Duke.

12:23.447 --> 12:25.403
<i>I'm in the Twilight Zone.</i>

12:31.487 --> 12:33.523
Would you like a coffee?

12:33.727 --> 12:37.515
- Oh, yes, that would be lovely.
- I'll give you a hand, Frasier.

12:39.767 --> 12:42.406
BOTH:
What the hell was that?

12:45.007 --> 12:47.362
I think we should put a little red mark
on the real Niles

12:47.527 --> 12:49.438
so we can tell them apart.

12:49.607 --> 12:51.165
Niles must be going nuts.

12:51.767 --> 12:54.440
- Can I lend you a hand?
- Oh, no, that's fine, Niles.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.520
Oh, but wait, wait a minute.
So, what do you think of Rodney?

12:58.967 --> 13:01.356
Bit of a pretentious fop,
wouldn't you say?

13:03.247 --> 13:06.762
- He doesn't remind you of anyone?
- Remind me of anyone?

13:06.927 --> 13:08.883
So sorry, but about my coffee.

13:09.087 --> 13:11.396
I neglected to mention
that I like my milk steamed.

13:11.567 --> 13:14.081
But just a dollop of foam,
such as might give the effect

13:14.247 --> 13:18.035
of a cumulus cloud
reflected in a still pond.

13:19.687 --> 13:21.405
Consider it done.

13:24.367 --> 13:26.597
I want to kill myself.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.638
Come on, Niles, it's funny.

13:30.847 --> 13:32.997
No, it's not remotely funny.

13:33.847 --> 13:37.044
Frasier talked me out of approaching
Daphne the night she fell for that man.

13:37.247 --> 13:38.680
You can't possibly be mad at me.

13:39.007 --> 13:41.396
No, no, Frasier, I'm grateful.
Come here.

13:41.567 --> 13:43.842
- Let me show you how grateful I am.
- Niles, calm down.

13:45.007 --> 13:47.840
- Isn't Rodney just great?
- Oh, yeah, nice guy.

13:48.007 --> 13:51.477
I think it was the moment I broke up
with Joe when I heard a voice say,

13:51.647 --> 13:55.276
"Daphne, it's time you went
for a completely new type of man."

13:55.807 --> 13:59.846
- You're a dead man.
- I'll serve our guests their coffee.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.844
Here we are. Coffee.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.885
Milk's on its way.
Niles is still steaming.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.519
- Sugar?
- Nothing on earth smells

14:08.687 --> 14:11.724
quite so heavenly as
a freshly brewed cup of coffee.

14:12.007 --> 14:14.043
Well, perhaps one thing does.

14:14.207 --> 14:16.675
Oh, stop that.

14:16.847 --> 14:18.758
He loves to smell my hair.

[DISH BREAKS]

[CHATTER]

14:35.807 --> 14:38.002
Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles.

14:38.727 --> 14:41.878
You don't take my calls,
you ignore me.

14:42.047 --> 14:45.084
For God's sake, it's the behaviour
of a pouting adolescent.

14:45.247 --> 14:47.203
Are you quite finished now?

14:48.367 --> 14:50.483
You put gum on my chair, didn't you?

14:52.727 --> 14:54.206
Yep.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.803
Niles, listen.

14:57.967 --> 15:01.926
I am terribly sorry
if I steered you wrong.

15:02.087 --> 15:04.043
But just think about it, you know.

15:04.207 --> 15:08.086
You do have a wonderful new
woman in your life now, don't you?

15:08.767 --> 15:11.327
Yes, I suppose I do.

15:11.887 --> 15:14.355
And Adelle does make you
very happy, doesn't she?

15:15.287 --> 15:16.686
Yes. Yes, she does.

15:16.847 --> 15:20.044
Well, then if you've ever taken
any of my advice before, take this.

15:20.567 --> 15:24.924
Adelle could very well be
the path to your happiness.

15:28.447 --> 15:30.483
But let's just say I'm wrong.

15:31.447 --> 15:35.645
But you're not wrong. Adelle
is a wonderful, affectionate woman.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.520
She's clearly drawn
to a man of my type.

15:40.727 --> 15:45.039
Just thinking about her lifts my spirits.
Frasier, thank you.

15:45.247 --> 15:47.636
Niles, look.

15:51.527 --> 15:53.040
I don't believe it.

15:53.207 --> 15:54.560
The betrayal.

15:54.727 --> 15:57.639
- No one treats Daphne like that!
- Niles.

15:59.047 --> 16:01.322
Whatever you do, do not engage
him in a physical fight.

16:01.487 --> 16:04.047
The whole thing
would just look too weird.

16:10.367 --> 16:11.846
Hello, Adelle.

16:12.247 --> 16:14.397
- Oh, no.
- I know this may look

16:14.567 --> 16:15.761
a tad incriminating, but the...

16:15.967 --> 16:19.642
Oh, spare me,
you ludicrous popinjay.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.286
I know exactly what's going on.
I saw the whole thing from my table.

16:23.447 --> 16:26.325
I was gonna call you.
You see, Rodney and I...

16:28.527 --> 16:31.166
- I'm sorry.
- So am I, Adelle.

16:31.327 --> 16:33.443
But I'm mostly sorry for Daphne.

16:33.607 --> 16:35.438
How do you intend
to handle that small matter?

16:35.647 --> 16:37.922
I was planning on telling her
this evening at Granville's.

16:38.087 --> 16:39.315
We're meeting for drinks.

16:39.887 --> 16:41.445
Granville's.

16:41.927 --> 16:43.963
Why don't you do her a favour?
Let me tell her.

16:44.127 --> 16:48.086
- Might be better coming from a friend.
- Yes, perhaps you're right.

16:48.247 --> 16:49.885
Please tell her that I'm sorry.

16:50.047 --> 16:52.766
Sometimes when a man meets the
woman that he's meant to be with,

16:52.927 --> 16:54.997
there's nothing he can do to resist it.

16:56.127 --> 16:57.640
I hope Daphne understands that.

17:00.207 --> 17:02.118
I hope she understands it too.

Rodney.

17:07.287 --> 17:08.606
Adelle.

17:11.327 --> 17:14.125
You know, there's just one thing
I'd think I'd like to ask you, Rodney.

17:15.247 --> 17:16.566
Do you have an older brother?

17:17.087 --> 17:20.363
As a matter of fact, I do. He's always
been the pride of the family.

17:20.727 --> 17:23.161
Handsome, successful, brilliant.

17:23.446 --> 17:25.563
I've always been rather jealous of him.

17:27.327 --> 17:28.885
Spooky.

[LOUNGE MUSIC PLAYING]

17:39.567 --> 17:42.286
- Evening, Daphne.
- Hello, Dr Crane.

17:43.047 --> 17:45.038
You don't seem surprised to see me.

17:45.447 --> 17:48.325
I was running late so I called
Rodney on his cell phone.

17:48.487 --> 17:52.400
- He told me everything.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.125
I'm sorry for you too.

17:55.207 --> 17:58.517
- Join me in a little sorrow-drowning?
- I believe I will.

17:58.687 --> 18:00.803
One more of these, please.

18:03.687 --> 18:05.200
Thank you.

18:07.927 --> 18:11.476
Well, you know,
I can't really blame Adelle.

18:11.647 --> 18:15.765
Rodney's that sort of man
that women seem to go for.

18:15.927 --> 18:17.599
Yes, he is.

18:18.087 --> 18:21.397
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
- No, you didn't.

18:21.847 --> 18:23.405
I guess I'm just more in the mood

18:23.567 --> 18:25.717
to hear about his
negative qualities right now.

18:25.887 --> 18:30.199
Oh, well, he's kind of a know-it-all.
A bit fussy.

18:30.367 --> 18:33.803
Has to have everything just so.
He's nuts about cleanliness.

18:33.967 --> 18:36.003
Then there's his clothes,
his precious shoes.

18:36.207 --> 18:38.357
I don't like this road we're on.

18:40.647 --> 18:45.846
I mean, wouldn't it be better
if we discussed what's in our future?

18:46.007 --> 18:47.520
I suppose.

18:47.687 --> 18:50.759
I'll tell you one thing,
after the run I've had lately,

18:50.927 --> 18:54.442
I pity the next man I date.
I'll probably rip him to shreds.

18:55.287 --> 18:57.403
What about the man after that?

18:59.447 --> 19:03.440
Men can be such an unfeeling lot.
Look at Rodney.

19:03.607 --> 19:07.156
The minute he heard I'd broken up
with someone, he moved in for the kill.

19:07.807 --> 19:09.798
Is that how all men are?

19:09.967 --> 19:12.083
No, not all men.

19:12.247 --> 19:15.683
No, of course they aren't.
You're not.

19:15.847 --> 19:18.645
You're kind, sensitive.

19:18.807 --> 19:21.367
If you ask me, you were
too good for that Adelle.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.164
Thank you, Daphne.

19:24.847 --> 19:28.556
You know, the truth is, my heart
was never really in that relationship.

19:31.487 --> 19:32.840
I thought it might not be.

19:33.407 --> 19:36.683
There was someone else
who was too much on my mind.

19:37.607 --> 19:39.359
I had a feeling, Dr Crane.

19:40.007 --> 19:42.805
- You did?
- Yes.

19:43.327 --> 19:45.522
As long as you still have
feelings for your wife,

19:45.687 --> 19:48.759
you know you can't be involved
with anyone else.

19:49.527 --> 19:50.801
And it makes sense to me.

19:50.967 --> 19:54.403
Why, I know I'd never get involved
with a man who was separated.

19:55.167 --> 19:57.556
Even if he'd worshipped you
from the day he laid eyes on you?

19:57.807 --> 20:01.004
And don't think that's
not just how they put it too.

20:03.687 --> 20:08.602
No, I think I need to do a bit of
separating myself. From Joe, I mean.

20:08.767 --> 20:13.045
Yes, I'll wait a good long time
before I do any more dating.

20:13.207 --> 20:15.675
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

20:15.847 --> 20:18.839
Yeah. You know, it's funny
when you think about it.

The two of us both coming
to this same singles' bar this week.

20:23.007 --> 20:26.477
You know, this was the very stool
I was on when I met Rodney.

20:26.647 --> 20:29.639
I was sitting here when I met Adelle.

20:31.207 --> 20:33.562
- What?
- Oh, I was just thinking.

20:33.767 --> 20:37.840
If it had been a different time in both
our lives, we might actually have met.

20:38.527 --> 20:40.757
Oh, how do you suppose
that would have gone?

20:40.927 --> 20:43.646
- What, our conversation?
- Yes. Go on, just for fun.

20:43.847 --> 20:46.281
We could both use a smile.

20:46.447 --> 20:50.042
Well, I would've said,
"Is this seat taken?"

20:50.207 --> 20:51.845
And you would've said no.

20:52.567 --> 20:54.956
And you would've said,
"My name is Daphne."

20:55.127 --> 20:57.687
And I would've said,
"My name is Niles."

20:57.887 --> 21:00.162
And then I would've said,

21:01.407 --> 21:04.046
"What are you doing
for the rest of your life?"

21:05.047 --> 21:08.278
You always know
just the right thing to say.
