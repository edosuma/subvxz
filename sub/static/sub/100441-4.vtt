01:02.771 --> 01:03.688
Good morning!

01:03.772 --> 01:05.482
Think you could turn that off?

01:05.565 --> 01:07.192
Sorry.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.360
- Wow.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.654
-You're great.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.448
Is it weird that I think

01:13.531 --> 01:16.493
you look more like yourself
when your hair is dyed

01:16.576 --> 01:18.328
-in that unnatural color?
-Well,

01:18.411 --> 01:20.497
I'm actually starting to feel
more like myself.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.873
For the first time since moving.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.168
-Did you meet up with Scot with one T?
-No.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.295
But I decided to make some changes.

01:27.378 --> 01:28.505
Since when do you cook?

01:29.089 --> 01:31.841
Since today.
I got an amazing night's sleep.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.469
I woke up at, like, five raring to go,

01:35.011 --> 01:36.429
and this is the result.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.890
-Smells delicious.
-Have a seat.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.602
Oh, bacon me, please.

01:42.685 --> 01:43.561
Does this mean

01:43.645 --> 01:45.522
you picked a drawing
for the application?

01:45.605 --> 01:48.066
That's fantastic.
I can take it to the post office tomorrow.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.110
-I got it, Mom.

01:50.735 --> 01:52.237
Well, I really don't mind.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.988
I need to get it there by Tuesday

01:54.072 --> 01:57.367
and this kind of organizational stuff
isn't really your thing.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.453
Oh. I... didn't realize that.

02:01.663 --> 02:05.333
Dad took care of these things
'cause you were always busy with your art

02:05.416 --> 02:06.918
and fixing up houses.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.419
That's what you're great at.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.297
You don't have to try and do everything.
It's cool.

02:14.592 --> 02:15.677
Right, sure. Okay.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.556
Bye, Mom.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.352
What was that?

02:26.354 --> 02:27.480
What was what?

02:27.564 --> 02:29.566
Your attitude towards Mom?

02:30.108 --> 02:32.777
-What attitude? I was just being honest.
-So,

02:32.986 --> 02:35.321
instead of being passive aggressive
like always,

02:35.405 --> 02:37.073
you woke up this morning and thought,

02:37.157 --> 02:38.950
"I'm just going to be
straight up aggressive"?

02:39.033 --> 02:40.326
I'm not being aggressive.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.578
You're not being normal.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.372
Hey!
No fighting in front of the bacon.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.175
All right, tell me what's going on.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.302
You really want to know?

02:57.927 --> 02:59.095
That's why I asked.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.890
It's simple. I took out my fear.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.933
What do you mean you took it out?

03:04.267 --> 03:05.268
The fear monster.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.896
I went back inside my head
and finished it off.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.522
And then I buried it.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.440
What?

03:12.358 --> 03:13.693
Are you kidding? You--

03:13.776 --> 03:15.737
You have no idea
what kind of damage that could do.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.614
If you haven't noticed,
I'm completely fine.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.781
Better than fine, in fact.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.742
It feels like
a huge thousand-pound rock

03:20.825 --> 03:22.869
-has been lifted off my chest.
-Love the hair, Kinsey.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.163
Yeah, it looks like
Easter came early.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.414
Thanks, girl!

03:29.083 --> 03:30.585
This isn't a game.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.711
Dad used the keys.

03:31.794 --> 03:32.670
Yeah.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.798
And how'd that work out for him?
He ran away from here and never came back.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.967
We don't know if that had anything to do
with the keys.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.928
I doubt he would've done anything
as stupid

03:40.011 --> 03:42.180
as take an entire emotion out of his head.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.391
I finally feel good for the first time
since he died.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.311
If you wanna hold that against me, fine,

03:48.436 --> 03:50.104
but you're not gonna kill my buzz.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.693
Damn. This is next level, Kinsey.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.861
Yeah, you did this yourself?

03:56.945 --> 03:59.072
Normally I'd worry it wasn't good enough
to show anyone,

03:59.155 --> 04:01.783
but this time I thought screw it!

04:01.866 --> 04:04.827
-Yeah, that's definitely good enough.
-It's awesome.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.288
Hey, so does that mean
you're back in the movie?

04:07.747 --> 04:08.998
If you guys'll have me.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.134
-Hey.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.220
-Hey.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.430
Look, I'm sorry for standing you up.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.266
It was shitty of me.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.812
Ah, it's... not as shitty as the band.
Ears are still ringing.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.606
I should've let you know
one way or another.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.691
Yeah.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.442
Let me make it up to you.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.029
Look, Kinsey, I--

04:40.321 --> 04:42.699
I just want you to know that I'm--
I'm not gonna be...

04:43.324 --> 04:46.202
sulking and weird about you or this, okay?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.371
I'm completely and a hundred percent fine

04:48.454 --> 04:50.331
with just being friends
if that's what you want.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.000
It's not what I want.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.170
I like you and I think we should hang out.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.924
Right, then yeah. Let's...

05:00.717 --> 05:02.719
-Let's definitely do that then.
-Great.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.721
Why don't you come over
after school?

05:06.639 --> 05:07.724
To Key House?

05:08.016 --> 05:09.934
-To the most haunted place in Matheson?

05:10.018 --> 05:11.686
Don't tell me Scot Cavendish is scared.

05:11.769 --> 05:13.896
Yes. I mean, no. Of course not.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.231
Elated.

05:15.523 --> 05:17.567
Cool. See ya later then.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.818
As you wish.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.575
Hey, something seemed a little different
about her, right?

05:25.658 --> 05:27.452
Yeah, she definitely looked brighter.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.287
-Well, her hair certainly did.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.421
-Hope I'm not keeping you from your work.
- Oh,

05:38.504 --> 05:39.422
not at all.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.133
Though if you ask Kinsey, that's...

05:43.134 --> 05:45.595
apparently all I'm doing right
these days.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.764
I'm sure she doesn't actually think that.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.771
I wanted to ask if you could help me
with something.

05:55.021 --> 05:58.191
I'd like to get in touch
with some of Rendell's old friends,

05:58.274 --> 06:00.693
try to learn a little more about him.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.072
These two, Erin...

06:04.906 --> 06:06.449
-and Mark.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.451
Erin still lives around here,

06:09.077 --> 06:10.661
but I doubt she'd be much help.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.747
She's in a psychiatric hospital.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.458
Why?

06:16.667 --> 06:18.378
She had an accident a while back.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.422
She hasn't spoken in 20 years.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.384
Like a... stroke?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.804
-That's awful.

06:28.179 --> 06:29.097
I'm so sorry.

06:30.973 --> 06:31.849
And Mark?

06:33.851 --> 06:35.061
He died in a house fire

06:35.520 --> 06:36.479
a few months back.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.982
I'm kinda the only one left.

06:40.942 --> 06:41.776
Oh...

06:41.859 --> 06:44.362
I'm an idiot.
I'm sorry for bringing all this up.

06:44.445 --> 06:45.279
Don't worry,

06:45.738 --> 06:46.572
you didn't know.

06:48.950 --> 06:49.951
Honestly...

06:51.577 --> 06:53.663
it's weirdly therapeutic being back here.

06:54.455 --> 06:57.250
I can't tell you how much time
we all spent in this house.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.335
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:00.086 --> 07:04.382
Rendell's parents were never around,
so it was kind of an adult-free zone.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.468
We were almost always down
in the ping-pong room.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.637
The what?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.139
The room in the basement.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.099
Have you not been down there yet?

07:22.733 --> 07:24.068
There's a room back there?

07:25.111 --> 07:27.363
Somebody must have boarded it up.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.532
- Oh!

07:32.452 --> 07:33.870
- Oh!

07:33.953 --> 07:36.247
Get after it, girl. Ooh!

07:48.593 --> 07:49.594
Oh, wow.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.972
I feel like I just stepped back in time.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.807
No shit.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.080
Looking for something?

08:18.956 --> 08:20.875
Nothing in particular.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.337
This is a strange question, but...

08:25.087 --> 08:28.174
you ever remember Rendell drawing
the omega symbol?

08:28.257 --> 08:30.259
Like from the Greek alphabet?

08:30.718 --> 08:33.095
No, I don't ever remember him doing that.
Why?

08:33.638 --> 08:34.555
Hmm.

08:35.389 --> 08:36.516
I'm sure it's nothing.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.687
Mm. This is a cool piece.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.066
I think it's late 1800s.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.196
Don't suppose you know where the key is.

08:50.738 --> 08:51.989
Afraid not.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.373
That was Rendell's chair.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.752
He always liked to be
in the middle of everything.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.504
I wish I'd known him back then.

09:28.901 --> 09:32.113
Miss Erin, I have a surprise for you.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.407
You have a visitor.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.704
This is a special day for her,
Chastity.

09:41.038 --> 09:43.040
She doesn't get many visitors.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.300
Have fun with your friend, okay?

09:56.887 --> 09:57.888
Hi, Vossie.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.350
It's been a while.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.647
Don't you have anything
you wanna say to me?

10:10.026 --> 10:11.277
The hell happened to you?

10:13.946 --> 10:14.947
Well...

10:17.742 --> 10:19.785
you wouldn't believe the bad luck
I've had.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.204
-First, your old boyfriend Rendell.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.956
You know, he's dead, right?

10:27.335 --> 10:28.252
Oops.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.130
Not my fault, by the way.

10:33.132 --> 10:36.218
-Then your old pal Mark went up in smoke.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.805
Also not my fault.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.683
And now you...

10:45.144 --> 10:47.772
you're really not making this very easy,
are you?

10:50.858 --> 10:51.859
It's all right.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.320
New plan.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.240
Just have to figure out a way
to get in here.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.751
I'll be back soon, Vossie.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.098
Hey, Tyler.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.599
Can I help you?

11:24.183 --> 11:25.184
Sorry, I was...

11:25.559 --> 11:27.228
-looking for Jackie.
-Oh,

11:27.311 --> 11:29.897
well, I'll try not to be too offended.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.693
No, Jackie's at choir practice,
she asked me to fill in.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.279
Listen, how's that hand of yours healing?

11:39.740 --> 11:40.574
It's fine.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.827
That was a pretty good right hand.

11:43.160 --> 11:43.994
You box?

11:45.079 --> 11:45.913
No.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.248
Walk with me.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.083
You know, my dad...

11:50.251 --> 11:51.877
he was a boxer in the Navy.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.547
Taught me when I was old enough.

11:55.631 --> 11:56.465
Are you good?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.050
Ooh! Yeah.

11:58.342 --> 12:01.095
-Well, I thought I was good.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.305
I practiced, I trained, and...

12:04.140 --> 12:05.975
worked out on the speed bag.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.437
I was gonna be the next
light heavyweight champion of the world

12:10.271 --> 12:13.399
There was this gym where one of the guys
who worked out there

12:13.607 --> 12:15.735
was ranked 15th in the world, right?

12:16.193 --> 12:18.279
And he was looking for sparring partners,

12:18.446 --> 12:19.739
so I signed up.

12:20.614 --> 12:21.824
A couple of weeks later,

12:22.324 --> 12:24.493
I get in the ring with him, right?

12:24.827 --> 12:26.537
And we are shuffling around, right,

12:26.620 --> 12:28.080
and he's throwing jabs,

12:28.414 --> 12:29.874
and I'm dodging.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.042
Yeah, can't touch this.

12:33.335 --> 12:37.631
And I'm thinking to myself, "This is easy,
let me see what I can do here."

12:38.048 --> 12:40.468
So I'd been working on this sneaky combo,
right?

12:41.135 --> 12:42.595
So I fired that baby off.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.015
Oh, yes! Yes!

12:46.474 --> 12:47.767
Except everything misses.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.228
And all of a sudden, pow!

12:51.437 --> 12:52.730
I'm on the canvas.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.356
And as I was laying there,

12:54.482 --> 12:58.152
that's when I decided
that what I really wanted to do

12:59.445 --> 13:00.946
was be an English teacher.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.742
-That makes total sense.
-Yeah.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.453
So, where are your shadows today?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.456
Brinker and Javi?

13:10.581 --> 13:11.457
Flying solo.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.209
-Thought I'd try something new.
-Ah.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.586
That's exactly my point, Tyler.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.713
New can be very good.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.483
Afternoon, soldier.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.027
Afternoon.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.905
How'd those traps work out for you?
You catch the enemy?

13:43.030 --> 13:44.615
Negative.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.867
That's too bad.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.247
Hey, Rufus?

13:52.414 --> 13:54.041
Has your mom ever mentioned

13:54.166 --> 13:56.085
anybody named Lucas?

13:57.336 --> 13:58.504
-Sure. Yeah.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.507
Really?

14:02.424 --> 14:03.425
Who is he?

14:04.635 --> 14:05.970
He was her first love.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.515
Oh.  Where is he now?

14:10.266 --> 14:11.350
He-- He died.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.144
Oh.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.355
She still gets sad about him sometimes.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.359
What do you know about the well house?

14:26.240 --> 14:28.117
My mom won't let me go near there.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.328
Bad stuff happened here.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.248
The British used Key House as a base

14:34.373 --> 14:35.666
during the Revolutionary War

14:35.749 --> 14:38.210
and they would hang defectors
in the well house.

15:02.943 --> 15:07.698
"Key House is one of the oldest
remaining structures in Matheson.

15:08.574 --> 15:12.411
Used as an intelligence base
in World War II."

15:12.870 --> 15:14.079
<i>Bode.</i>

15:20.961 --> 15:22.004
<i>Bode.</i>

15:23.172 --> 15:24.882
<i>You can't protect them.</i>

15:35.059 --> 15:35.893
Hey.

15:36.810 --> 15:37.853
When do you wanna meet up?

15:38.270 --> 15:39.480
For... what?

15:40.064 --> 15:41.440
To get sponsors for the 5K?

15:41.732 --> 15:43.901
Mr. Ridgeway said you wanted to volunteer.

15:44.902 --> 15:45.903
Uh...

15:46.737 --> 15:49.156
-If you don't want to, it's fine.
-No, I do. Uh...

15:50.491 --> 15:51.450
I was just thinking that

15:52.159 --> 15:55.329
we could hit up some downtown businesses
later before they close.

15:55.412 --> 15:56.956
I think that's a great idea.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.166
Way to go, Tyler.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.376
You just saved the 5K.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.628
I will see you at the car, Jackie.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.130
Uh...  Sorry.

16:05.839 --> 16:09.677
If she doesn't have her afternoon
sugar-free Red Bull, she gets cranky.

16:10.427 --> 16:11.470
Here.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.305
Put your number in my phone.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.523
Cool case.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.275
Thanks.  I'm a total anglophile.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.694
I'll see you after school.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.320
Yeah.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.494
Mr. Ridgeway?

16:37.329 --> 16:39.540
Oh, Tyler. Good, I need your help.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.334
I want you to hold this chair

16:43.043 --> 16:45.004
while I water my streptocarpus.

16:48.799 --> 16:52.136
I just talked to Jackie, and apparently,
I've, uh...

16:52.511 --> 16:54.513
signed up to volunteer for the 5K.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.557
Well... you did say

16:56.640 --> 16:58.434
you wanted to try something new, right?

16:59.143 --> 17:00.352
Yeah, but--

17:00.436 --> 17:02.771
High school is the perfect time

17:03.272 --> 17:05.232
to try on a bunch of different hats.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.109
You get to decide who you are,

17:07.192 --> 17:10.070
-who you surround yourself with.

17:10.154 --> 17:13.157
Feels like people pretty much
made their minds up about me.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.952
New kid, dead dad, weird house.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.079
Yeah, well...

17:20.164 --> 17:22.499
Look...

17:26.045 --> 17:29.089
I know firsthand
that grief never gets any smaller,

17:30.049 --> 17:32.468
so you have to make yourself bigger
around it.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.095
The best way to do that is to open up.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.139
Let people in.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.599
I don't even know where to start.

17:39.349 --> 17:42.061
Mm... Now when I met my wife, Callie,

17:43.520 --> 17:45.981
I thought we were as opposite
as you could be.

17:46.648 --> 17:49.318
And then I learned
that she had a thing for gardening.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.154
Fiddle figs were her favorite.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.572
Ficus lyrata.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.742
And once we could talk about that...

17:57.951 --> 17:59.661
then we could talk about anything.

18:00.954 --> 18:03.874
-You play Cupid with all your students?
- Nah,

18:03.957 --> 18:06.794
just have a soft spot
for the underdog.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.646
Take that!

18:40.953 --> 18:42.579
She keeps it in her sock drawer.

18:44.706 --> 18:45.707
Don't say anything.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.501
Understood?

18:47.918 --> 18:49.086
What's in it for me?

18:54.508 --> 18:55.551
What the--

18:55.926 --> 18:58.178
It's to stop the well lady from coming in.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.597
Did she come back?

19:01.014 --> 19:03.350
No, not exactly.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.728
But you won't believe me
until you see her yourself.

19:07.187 --> 19:08.438
Okay, so...

19:10.899 --> 19:13.944
Kinsey took her fear out of her head.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.362
Whoa.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.613
And I was thinking

19:16.780 --> 19:18.407
if she can take something out...

19:25.706 --> 19:26.623
Whoa,

19:26.832 --> 19:29.126
it's the front door of our house
in Seattle.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.171
...maybe I can put something in.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.179
Hold on.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.140
Let me see the book.

19:49.396 --> 19:51.106
There's the well house.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.657
Proceed.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.304
Was something supposed to happen?

20:22.387 --> 20:24.181
Ask me something about Matheson.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.183
When was Matheson founded?

20:26.266 --> 20:29.603
Matheson was settled in 1639,
incorporated in 1658,

20:29.686 --> 20:31.772
and officially became a township in 1741.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.652
-Was that right?
-I don't know. You took the book.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.574
Do we have anything on England?

21:25.117 --> 21:29.621
It's hard to believe you pulled that out
of the trash just a couple of days ago.

21:30.998 --> 21:31.873
Hey...

21:32.124 --> 21:35.669
it wasn't in the trash,
it was next to the trash.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.504
Whatever you say.

21:39.589 --> 21:40.465
It's beautiful.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.886
In recovery, they advise
against trading one addiction

21:44.970 --> 21:45.971
for another, but...

21:46.555 --> 21:49.266
I think they'd make an exception
for home improvement.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.143
Brought you a little something.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.192
Perfect.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.235
I love it.

22:02.654 --> 22:03.697
One year, Nina.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.533
-That's a big deal.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.290
Thank you.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.797
Different places, different faces.

22:29.556 --> 22:30.515
You know, uh...

22:32.017 --> 22:33.185
you helped me, too.

22:34.436 --> 22:38.607
When I left home, all I wanted
was different places, different faces.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.985
I found the best one.

22:52.746 --> 22:57.209
Okay, so next on the list is Harbor Cafe,
but it's all the way across town.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.586
It's too bad
there's no public transportation here.

22:59.669 --> 23:02.839
Ah, yes. For the thriving metropolis
that is Matheson.

23:03.632 --> 23:04.674
Did you know that, um...

23:05.133 --> 23:08.095
London is home to the oldest section
of underground railway in the world?

23:08.178 --> 23:10.180
-It opened in 1863.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.182
-I did not know that.

23:12.599 --> 23:13.683
Have you been to London?

23:13.767 --> 23:16.520
I went once as a kid
and I've always wanted to go back.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.021
Did you also know that York

23:18.105 --> 23:20.107
was the first English city
to be settled by Vikings

23:20.190 --> 23:22.192
in the year 866 A.D.?

23:22.359 --> 23:24.569
-Are you into Vikings?

23:25.695 --> 23:28.532
Uh... You said you were an anglophile...

23:28.657 --> 23:31.451
-Um...
-Oh. Yes, I did.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.370
Yeah, yeah, um... honestly though,

23:33.453 --> 23:36.706
the reason I say that is
because I'm such a huge Jane Austen fan.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.834
<i>Pride and Prejudice,</i> right?

23:39.459 --> 23:41.044
-Yeah, uh...

23:41.253 --> 23:42.629
That's everyone's favorite.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.132
And don't get me wrong,
I love me some Mr. Darcy,

23:45.215 --> 23:48.802
but my favorite's actually her last novel,
<i>Sanditon.</i>

23:49.469 --> 23:50.512
Have you read it?

23:52.347 --> 23:54.141
-Can't say I have.
-Well,

23:54.224 --> 23:57.436
she got sick before she could complete it
and then after she died,

23:57.519 --> 24:00.564
other writers tried to mimic her writing
and finish it,

24:00.647 --> 24:03.525
but there is no mimicking Jane Austen,

24:03.608 --> 24:06.653
and I'm so fascinated by the whole story.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.197
Never... never met anyone else
who's read it, so...

24:09.281 --> 24:10.615
I'll have to check it out.

24:10.824 --> 24:13.076
It's probably not your thing.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.717
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.100
Allow me.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.061
-Very gentlemanly.
-I'm English.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.900
-I've always wanted to see this place.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.403
Have you been out to the cliffs?

24:48.487 --> 24:50.822
Yeah, my brother and I went out there
when we first got here.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.283
So you've seen the sea caves
where them three kids drowned

24:53.366 --> 24:54.201
back in the day.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.036
Kids drowned down there?

24:57.037 --> 24:59.831
-Oh. Yeah.
-How is it you know all this?

24:59.915 --> 25:02.167
-You're not even from Matheson.
-Well...

25:02.459 --> 25:03.418
I went down a little bit

25:03.502 --> 25:05.545
of a local lore rabbit hole

25:05.629 --> 25:07.672
doing research for <i>The Splattering.</i>
You'd be surprised

25:07.756 --> 25:10.008
what people tell you
for a free scoop of salted caramel.

25:10.091 --> 25:11.259
Trust me.

25:11.551 --> 25:12.385
Come on.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.891
Whoa.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.101
So is your family around?

25:20.310 --> 25:23.396
Nah. Tyler's out and Bode's with my mom
at the hardware store,

25:23.480 --> 25:25.482
which is basically like her second home.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.902
Guess we have the whole place
to ourselves.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.697
So, what should we do?

25:35.450 --> 25:37.369
-How about a tour?
-Brilliant. Yes.

25:37.619 --> 25:42.374
This is the drawing room,
and just past it is the winter study.

25:43.416 --> 25:44.376
I see.

25:44.918 --> 25:48.672
And could you point me in the direction
of the autumnal study?

25:49.172 --> 25:51.591
How about I point you in the direction
of my room?

25:55.428 --> 25:57.722
-Are you coming or not?
-Yeah, definitely.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.150
Hadouken!

26:09.526 --> 26:11.611
Sorry, it's stupid.

26:19.661 --> 26:20.787
So, I, um...

26:21.496 --> 26:24.791
I'm always-- I'm always fascinated
by how many... how many things

26:24.874 --> 26:26.001
you ladies have.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.503
-Definitely.
-Yeah, like,

26:28.628 --> 26:31.131
what's, uh... what's this, for instance?

26:31.756 --> 26:33.383
That's an eraser.

26:34.050 --> 26:35.552
Knew that.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.388
Come sit down.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.442
I want to show you something.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.194
Yeah?

26:54.571 --> 26:55.572
What's that?

26:56.906 --> 26:59.034
But if I show this to you,

26:59.117 --> 27:00.952
-you can't tell anybody

27:01.620 --> 27:03.997
and you have to promise not to freak out.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.041
Okay.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.966
-Okay, whoa,

27:15.050 --> 27:17.469
what's going on here? Uh...

27:17.677 --> 27:18.803
And who might you be?

27:19.220 --> 27:20.764
-It's me, Kinsey.
-No,

27:20.847 --> 27:21.723
see...

27:22.682 --> 27:24.684
I'm hallucinating, right?
I must be hallucin--

27:24.768 --> 27:26.811
You-- You're not real.
I must be hallucinating

27:26.895 --> 27:28.063
because that would mean...

27:28.563 --> 27:30.982
Am I dead?

27:31.191 --> 27:35.153
-Wait, am I dead? Am I--
-Scot! Scot, Scot. Trust me.

27:39.366 --> 27:40.408
Steady on, mate.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.798
How is this even possible?

27:55.548 --> 27:56.966
We're inside my head.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.096
I know, I know a mall is lame, but...

28:01.638 --> 28:02.847
Yes, so, how exactly

28:02.931 --> 28:05.183
are we... are we inside your head?

28:07.769 --> 28:10.855
Key House is full of these keys
that let you do magical stuff.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.858
This one lets you go into people's heads.

28:14.442 --> 28:16.986
Right, so what you're saying is...

28:17.737 --> 28:18.697
I am dead.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.865
What I'm saying...

28:22.033 --> 28:23.368
is the magic is real.

28:24.452 --> 28:25.704
For us.

28:26.287 --> 28:29.082
I figured you of all people
would appreciate it.

28:34.629 --> 28:35.672
You're taking the piss.

28:35.755 --> 28:37.841
-Where have you taken me?
-I know it sounds crazy.

28:37.924 --> 28:38.758
Crazy? No,

28:38.842 --> 28:40.760
this is beyond crazy, okay?

28:40.844 --> 28:44.472
This is absolutely bloody barmy.
This is completely mental.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.515
Wow.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.684
You get a lot more English under stress.

28:48.643 --> 28:50.311
Come on. This way.

28:50.937 --> 28:52.021
What...

28:55.066 --> 28:56.985
These are all filled with my memories.

28:57.819 --> 29:00.071
Course they are. Why a candy shop?

29:00.905 --> 29:02.407
My dad had a sweet tooth.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.117
It kind of brushed off on me.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.914
-This was my favorite birthday.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.667
I didn't have a lot of friends,

29:12.792 --> 29:15.336
so my dad planned this whole day
at the aquarium just for us.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.088
I was eight.

29:17.922 --> 29:18.923
Can I see?

29:26.598 --> 29:28.600
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

29:28.683 --> 29:29.517
Fish.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.977
Fish who?

29:31.060 --> 29:32.228
Gesundheit.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.484
-He was a bit of a comedian.
-He certainly thought so.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.028
Hey.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.697
They even have live sharks over there.

29:42.822 --> 29:43.990
Pretty creepy, huh?

29:51.498 --> 29:53.833
Wow.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.378
Scot, are you okay?

30:03.426 --> 30:04.594
I knew it.

30:04.677 --> 30:06.054
I freakin' knew it.

30:06.137 --> 30:08.139
I always knew. I knew magic existed.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.141
This universe is way too complex

30:10.225 --> 30:11.768
and random for it not to exist,
you know?

30:12.435 --> 30:14.229
- Totally.

30:14.312 --> 30:15.396
I mean... Ah!

30:19.567 --> 30:20.568
Are you okay?

30:21.528 --> 30:24.405
I always thought it was just me
and my dad that day.

30:25.740 --> 30:26.574
How come?

30:27.659 --> 30:28.660
I don't know.

30:29.035 --> 30:31.663
I mean, she isn't really
the traditional parent type.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.039
Not like my dad was.

30:34.499 --> 30:35.708
She's always been there.

30:37.794 --> 30:40.046
I can't believe I blocked her
out of that memory.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.423
Whoa, hey, hey... Hey, hey.

30:42.757 --> 30:44.592
Don't be so hard on yourself, all right?

30:44.676 --> 30:46.928
Our brains are...
they're imperfect machines.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.806
They do all kinds of crazy stuff
all the time.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.808
I mean, Kinsey, look at this place.

30:52.392 --> 30:53.601
This is mental.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.190
All right?

31:30.430 --> 31:32.223
-Hey.
-And here I was thinking

31:32.307 --> 31:34.017
I was the only
loser at the library

31:34.100 --> 31:35.435
-on a Saturday.

31:35.518 --> 31:36.561
Whatcha got there?

31:37.562 --> 31:38.396
Research.

31:38.813 --> 31:39.689
Cool.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.357
For what?

31:43.234 --> 31:46.195
I know you said
it probably wasn't my thing, but...

31:49.157 --> 31:51.743
I didn't mean for it to come off that way,
I just...

31:52.535 --> 31:55.163
I felt like a complete asshole
the whole ride home.

31:55.455 --> 31:59.834
Some people consider this stuff chick lit
and I hate that term, it's so sexist.

32:00.919 --> 32:04.422
Almost as sexist as thinking a guy
couldn't possibly enjoy the work

32:04.505 --> 32:06.466
of a feminist romance novelist?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.135
I didn't realize you were so funny.

32:09.218 --> 32:11.387
You didn't pick up on that
when I was boring you to death

32:11.471 --> 32:12.972
-with facts about the UK?

32:13.097 --> 32:16.267
I was just about to go
and grab some clam chowder at Phil's.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.560
Wanna come?

32:17.852 --> 32:19.354
Absolutely not.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.273
Bill's is so much better.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.317
-They're different?
-Very different.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.319
It's the best chowder in the country.

32:26.402 --> 32:29.364
Clearly you've never been to Seattle
because Duke's is the best in the world.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.282
You do not know what you're talking about.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.242
Well, prove me wrong then.

32:33.326 --> 32:36.371
Prepare to have your world shaken, Locke.

32:50.593 --> 32:51.970
I brought a peace offering.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.096
Oyster crackers.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.722
Are they from Phil's?

32:54.806 --> 32:57.475
Phil's is trash.
Don't let anyone tell you different.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.644
These are from Bill's, which is the best.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.270
-Better than Duke's?

33:01.854 --> 33:05.108
No, but... don't tell Jackie that.

33:05.191 --> 33:07.902
Oh... So, you were there with Jackie.

33:08.444 --> 33:09.529
Relax.

33:09.612 --> 33:10.697
It's just chowder.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.699
Mm-hmm. That's how it starts.

33:12.782 --> 33:15.576
-Next thing you know, it's a lobster roll.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.372
I'm happy for you.

33:20.623 --> 33:21.874
You know, for the record,

33:22.041 --> 33:23.084
I like the new hair.

33:23.710 --> 33:27.380
Or, the new version of the old hair?
Whatever it is.

33:27.463 --> 33:29.424
-And taking that thing

33:29.507 --> 33:32.677
out of your head
made you feel so much better.

33:34.345 --> 33:36.723
-Guess it can't be too terrible.
-Really?

33:36.806 --> 33:39.600
What about the "keys aren't toys"
and all that?

33:39.684 --> 33:40.685
Guess I should tell you,

33:40.935 --> 33:41.811
I...

33:43.146 --> 33:45.106
-used the Head Key yesterday.
-Really?

33:45.815 --> 33:47.942
I mean, it didn't really have
the desired effect,

33:48.026 --> 33:49.902
but the upside is I now know a ton
about Big Ben.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.447
-Why would you wanna know a shi--

33:54.615 --> 33:55.575
Bode?

33:56.117 --> 33:58.202
-Is that you?

34:11.132 --> 34:12.258
What's going on?

34:12.341 --> 34:14.385
-It's her.
-What?

34:14.469 --> 34:16.471
The Well Lady! She's back!

34:16.929 --> 34:18.139
Where'd you get that?

34:18.723 --> 34:20.683
The yard. To defend myself.

34:21.267 --> 34:22.101
What?

34:28.232 --> 34:29.317
What does she want?

34:30.902 --> 34:31.903
The keys.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.366
-Shit.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.587
Oh, my God.

35:09.857 --> 35:10.858
Mom's downstairs!

35:22.578 --> 35:25.665
You thought you could stop me?
With Dubble Bubble and a tree branch?

35:28.626 --> 35:30.628
Give me what I want.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.171
-Never!
-Fine.

35:32.839 --> 35:33.673
No!

35:34.549 --> 35:36.342
-Tyler! Help me!

35:41.139 --> 35:41.973
Mom?

35:50.815 --> 35:52.275
Watch out! Stand back!

36:01.576 --> 36:02.577
What happened?

36:02.952 --> 36:04.078
I don't know.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.998
Well, did you see anybody?

36:07.081 --> 36:09.584
What do you mean? Why would I see anybody?

36:10.459 --> 36:12.837
Where's Bode?

36:16.257 --> 36:17.091
Bode?

36:44.327 --> 36:46.495
Give me the Head Key.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.414
Why do you want it so bad?

36:48.497 --> 36:50.124
I need it to find something.

36:56.422 --> 36:57.423
Bode!

37:00.509 --> 37:03.012
So why haven't you just taken it from me?

37:03.471 --> 37:05.431
I'm done playing games!

37:06.015 --> 37:07.600
Give me the key.

37:11.437 --> 37:12.271
Bode!

37:15.900 --> 37:17.735
You can't take it from me, can you?

37:19.362 --> 37:21.072
You need me to give it to you!

37:25.117 --> 37:27.787
You think you're so clever.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.164
Well, I can be clever, too.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.251
Stay tuned...

37:34.794 --> 37:35.836
Bode.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.105
Bode!

37:57.817 --> 37:58.901
Are you okay?

37:59.485 --> 38:00.319
Yeah.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.947
Okay.

38:04.782 --> 38:05.783
Let's go inside.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.288
I just don't understand.

38:10.663 --> 38:11.539
Maybe...

38:12.623 --> 38:14.542
there was a gas leak or...

38:15.543 --> 38:17.086
I left the stove on.

38:18.838 --> 38:21.799
I just don't remember even using it.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.509
It wasn't your fault.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.019
I wish your father was here.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.566
Mom?

38:42.653 --> 38:43.696
I was wrong.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.782
About what I said yesterday.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.410
You were always there for me.

38:52.830 --> 38:53.831
I'm sorry.

38:58.919 --> 39:00.546
It's fine, honey.

39:04.258 --> 39:05.259
Don't worry.

39:21.317 --> 39:22.568
How did you get in here?

39:22.777 --> 39:23.652
Really, Sam?

39:23.778 --> 39:26.322
You wanna talk about
the mechanics of how I get around,

39:27.281 --> 39:29.950
or do you wanna talk
about how I'm gonna get you out?

39:30.117 --> 39:31.243
I've been waiting.

39:31.410 --> 39:34.163
You're here because of your own mistakes.

39:35.623 --> 39:36.624
But I'm back,

39:37.291 --> 39:38.626
like I promised.

39:40.044 --> 39:42.088
I always keep my promises, Sam.

39:43.839 --> 39:46.008
The question is, can you?

39:46.092 --> 39:47.968
-I'll do anything you want.
-Okay.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.888
Because you can't stray from the path
this time.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.140
If we're gonna be a family,

39:53.224 --> 39:55.434
I need to know that I can trust you.

39:56.852 --> 39:58.396
Can I trust you, Sam?

39:58.479 --> 39:59.355
Always.

40:00.773 --> 40:01.649
Good.

40:03.609 --> 40:05.361
Because I'm gonna give you a chance

40:05.528 --> 40:06.779
to prove yourself.
