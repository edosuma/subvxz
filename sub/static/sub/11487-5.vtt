00:01.680 --> 00:02.953
Why do you have to leave?

00:03.120 --> 00:05.475
Charlie, l have to get home.
l have to feed my cat.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.393
-l have to feed my fish.
-We've been in bed for three days.

00:08.560 --> 00:12.189
l'm guessing the cat's fed and what's
left of the fish is in the Kitty Litter.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.239
Well, l also have a job.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.197
-Call in sick.
-l did it yesterday.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.749
Okay, call in horny.
l'll write you a note.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.229
l wish l could. l love being with you.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.072
Me too.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.955
And having you here
just makes it all the better.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.475
We've been seeing each other
for over two months. . .

00:29.640 --> 00:31.312
. . .and you've never spent the night.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.552
Well, go clean up the dead animals
and l'll come over tonight.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.551
Deal. l'll cook you dinner.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.312
Great.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.637
l think l love you, Charlie Harper.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.432
Thank you.
l'll see you later.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.477
Wait a minute.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.031
Did you just say ''thank you''?

01:01.600 --> 01:03.192
-Did l?
-Yes.

01:03.360 --> 01:07.399
l said, ''l think l love you''
and you said, ''Thank you. ''

01:07.560 --> 01:10.950
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Thank you?

01:11.560 --> 01:13.391
lt's an expression of appreciation.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.392
Thank you.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.834
That's it?
You don't have anything to add?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.433
Thank you. . .

01:22.600 --> 01:24.591
. . .so very much.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.676
Great. That's great. l open my heart
to you and you couldn't care less.

01:28.840 --> 01:31.479
Well, that's not fair.
l could care less. A lot less.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.471
What do you want me to do?
Lie to you?

01:35.640 --> 01:41.351
No, l want you to drop dead,
you smug, cold-hearted son of a bitch.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.152
That could have been ugly.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.631
Hey, guess what happened
at school today.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.429
-You made the honor roll.
-What's that?

02:03.880 --> 02:06.474
Forget it.
What happened at school?

02:06.640 --> 02:09.711
-Well, there's this girl--
-Okay, now l'm listening.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.397
-Her name is Robin Newberry.
-Name's not important. Proceed.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.993
She gave me a cupcake.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.310
-Yeah? So?
-l think she likes me.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.916
-So, what's the problem?
-Now l think she thinks l like her back.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.591
-Do you?
-l didn't think l did.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.035
But it was a really good cupcake.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.393
Wow, talk about
your perfect metaphor.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.070
No, it was a cupcake.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.033
Okay, blank slate. Listen up.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.432
l'm gonna tell you something
that will serve you well for life.

02:40.600 --> 02:43.319
Like, ''When you're peeing outside,
always face downwind''?

02:43.720 --> 02:46.518
Better. By the way,
what the hell were you thinking?

02:46.680 --> 02:50.229
l was thinking,
''Boy, l hope that's really warm rain. ''

02:51.360 --> 02:54.079
Okay, okay.
Let's focus on today's lesson.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.232
Never, ever
confuse cupcakes with love.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.353
But l love cupcakes.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.157
We all love cupcakes. That doesn't mean
you have to love the baker.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.197
-Her mom baked it.
-Missing the point.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.749
-Robin just helped with the icing.
-Okay. Okay.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.480
She made a smiley face
with Red Hots.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.794
l get it.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.032
l'm just saying that when someone
freely gives you her cupcake. . .

03:17.200 --> 03:18.997
. . .your only obligation is to enjoy it.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.957
No reason to get emotionally involved.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.350
-Why not?
-lf you do, you'll be stuck. . .

03:23.520 --> 03:26.637
. . .eating the same damn cupcake
for the rest of your life.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.270
But it was a really good cupcake.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.112
l can't stop thinking about it.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.795
Yeah, l've had cupcakes like that.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.751
The thing you gotta remember is
there will always be other cupcakes.

03:41.920 --> 03:45.595
And if the day should come when you
find yourself in a cupcake drought--

03:45.760 --> 03:48.320
And those days come,
don't kid yourself.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.359
--well, then you just shell out
a couple of bucks for a nice Ho Ho.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.274
-Understand?
-l think so. Thanks, Uncle Charlie.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.032
No problem.

04:01.560 --> 04:04.757
-Hey, what are you guys talking about?
-Sex.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.716
Well, how about that?

04:09.880 --> 04:12.235
The booger eater
grasped the symbolism.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.954
-You were talking to my son about sex?
-He came to me with a cupcake problem.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.473
l thought it was about sex.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.517
l was using cupcakes as a metaphor.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.193
Jeez, the kid got it.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.670
Okay, walk me through the metaphor.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.548
-Some little girl gave him a cupcake--
-Okay, stop.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.668
''Gave him a cupcake. ''
Are we talking baked goods. . .

04:32.840 --> 04:34.956
. . .or are we talking
some new hip-hop slang?

04:35.600 --> 04:38.637
Baked goods. l told him it was okay
to enjoy the cupcake. . .

04:38.800 --> 04:40.756
. . .without feeling
emotionally obligated.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.192
So you told my son
it's okay to have sex with a girl. . .

04:44.360 --> 04:46.316
. . .without having
any feelings towards her?

04:46.480 --> 04:49.711
Lucky for us
he asked me stuff l know about.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.993
There's no ''us'' here.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.230
There's no ''lucky. ''
That's a terrible lesson.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.551
Hey, l could've done 20 minutes
just on licking the icing.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.393
But l took the high road.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.915
Okay, okay, enough.
Here's the deal.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.992
From now on, all cupcake conversations
will be referred to me.

05:07.160 --> 05:10.516
Why? You don't know the difference
between a Ding Dong and your elbow.

05:13.880 --> 05:18.874
Nevertheless, l do not want him learning
about relationships from a misogynist.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.675
A misogynist?
You're saying l'm a misogynist?

05:21.840 --> 05:23.558
Yes, Charlie. You are a misogynist.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.553
l'm a misogynist?
l'm a misogynist?

05:28.720 --> 05:32.190
That is really low, Alan.
Calling your own brother a misogynist.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.749
G-l-N or G-E-N?

05:37.160 --> 05:39.720
-G-Y-N.
-Thanks.

05:40.480 --> 05:43.472
-l do not hate women.
-Oh, come on, Charlie.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.835
lf anything,
l am the opposite of a misogynist.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.879
l'm a pro-sogynist. l love women.

05:50.040 --> 05:54.033
Oh, is that so? Even if there's no
possibility of having sex with them?

05:57.880 --> 05:59.199
What?

05:59.360 --> 06:03.273
Exactly. And it is precisely that attitude
l do not want my son to grow up with.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.556
Okay, okay. Hold it just a second.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.631
So you'd rather
he grow up to be like you?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.518
Scared of women?
Manipulated by women?

06:09.680 --> 06:12.399
-Hey, that's not true.
-Oh, please. Look at your ex-wife.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.233
Say what you want about me,
but l've never chosen women. . .

06:15.400 --> 06:17.595
-. . .who do nothing but mistreat me.
-Hey, stud.

06:17.760 --> 06:21.355
l don't know what kind of sick, twisted
party you had the last couple days. . .

06:21.520 --> 06:23.636
. . .but l sure as hell
ain't cleaning it up.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.637
That is different. Way different.

06:34.760 --> 06:38.196
-Hey, Dad, what time is it?
-Twenty after 6. Why?

06:38.360 --> 06:41.113
Because l have to call my girlfriend
at 6:30.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.308
-What girlfriend?
-Robin Newberry.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.038
Cupcake Robin Newberry?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.673
-Charlie, stay out of it.
-How can l stay out of it?

06:54.840 --> 06:58.196
lf l saw a bus heading for him,
would l not throw myself in front of it?

06:58.360 --> 07:00.920
-Would you?
-l'm just making a point here.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.150
Charlie, if you don't mind,
l'll handle it.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.436
Jake, l thought we talked about this.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.512
l shouldn't take a cupcake
from a girl if l don't like her.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.513
-That's right.
-So l decided to like her.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.195
We're exclusive.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.388
-Exclusive?
-That means l don't talk to other girls. . .

07:19.560 --> 07:21.869
. . .and l get a cupcake every day.

07:24.840 --> 07:27.912
l'd better call now.
lf l'm late, she yells at me.

07:29.080 --> 07:32.470
Congratulations, Alan.
Your son is officially pastry whipped.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.111
Marco.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.996
Not now, Rose.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.958
Marco.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.029
Rose, l'm not in the mood.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.038
Marco.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.271
Polo.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.355
-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.714
Something wrong?

08:06.120 --> 08:07.473
l'm not sure.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.915
Rose, do you think l'm a misogynist?

08:10.080 --> 08:12.799
Oh, wow, yeah.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.349
Why? Did somebody say you weren't?

08:17.560 --> 08:19.357
Marco.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.839
How can l be a misogynist?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.037
My whole life is a testament
to my love for women.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.031
lt's sweet that you think that. . .

08:26.200 --> 08:29.272
. . .but what you call love
is really just an obsession to control. . .

08:29.440 --> 08:32.352
. . .and dominate
based on mistrust and hostility.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.150
Yeah, so?

08:35.320 --> 08:37.788
You forget
l spent the night with you once.

08:37.960 --> 08:42.158
You don't make love to a woman,
you overpower her.

08:42.320 --> 08:47.075
You subjugate her. You ravage her.

08:52.160 --> 08:56.995
Anyhow, it's obvious you're still trying
to resolve longstanding Oedipal issues.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.158
Hold on.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.476
O-E-D.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.588
-You sure?
-Yeah, l have a Master's in psychology.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.034
And l know how to spell.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.636
''l have a Master's in psychology
and l know how to spell. ''

09:12.920 --> 09:15.354
Here it is: Oedipus complex.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.713
Okay, that's what l thought.
lt's just sick.

09:18.880 --> 09:22.668
Unconscious, unresolved
sexual feelings towards my mother?

09:22.840 --> 09:24.796
l didn't write the dictionary, Charlie.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.435
But it's not true.
l despise my mother.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.919
Consciously, yes.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.958
And that's why
you conflate sex and aggression.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.758
lt's textbook misogyny.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.993
Conflate? Come on.
What is it, fancy word day?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.515
lt means to join together.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.796
Thank you.
So, what are you saying?

09:42.960 --> 09:45.030
You will never be able
to have a trusting. . .

09:45.200 --> 09:47.634
. . .and truly loving relationship
with any woman. . .

09:47.800 --> 09:50.189
. . .until you resolve
your feelings about your mother.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.954
Broads have been
telling me that for years.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.599
lt's a lot of hooey.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.751
lt's okay, Charlie.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.957
The world is filled with
women who seek out misogynists.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.838
Women who need
men to mistreat them. . .

10:02.000 --> 10:04.230
. . .and provide them
with angry, aggressive sex. . .

10:04.400 --> 10:07.358
. . .in order to satisfy
their own twisted pathology.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.119
l see.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.033
Well, l guess l'll just have to
look for a woman like that.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.316
Marco.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.952
-Thanks for giving me another chance.
-You were so darling, l couldn't resist.

10:25.120 --> 10:28.237
l know l've got some intimacy issues,
but l'm working on them.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.791
And if you could just
be patient with me. . .

10:30.960 --> 10:35.397
. . .l think you and l
could truly conflate.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.759
What's ''conflate'' mean?

10:45.000 --> 10:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:52.640 --> 10:54.676
Look, you don't have to go.

10:54.840 --> 10:58.150
Relax, Charlie. All men
have performance problems occasionally.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.518
No, no, no. lt's not officially
a performance problem until we give up.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.598
Right now,
it's just unusually long foreplay.

11:06.760 --> 11:11.390
Sorry, but l have to get back to work.
Damn, my carpal tunnel's acting up.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.193
How about if l come with you?

11:14.360 --> 11:17.830
-We can give it a shot in your car.
-lt's okay. l still love you.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.958
Thank you.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.590
l mean, l really appreciate
your understanding. . .

11:24.760 --> 11:27.718
. . .and support during this dark time.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.637
l'll call you.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.874
-What?
-Nothing.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.672
Go ahead. Say it.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.073
l have nothing to say.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.558
Except, you know:

12:01.480 --> 12:05.268
Oh, my. Don't tell me
l got a rise out of you.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.310
Alan, l am right on the edge.
Be very careful.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.279
Sorry.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.718
l didn't realize it was so impotent.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.436
-You forget one thing.
-Oh, what's that?

12:24.600 --> 12:26.716
l can still run.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.554
Yes?

12:41.720 --> 12:42.994
Mom, it's me, Charlie.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.276
I'm a little busy right now.
What do you want?

12:45.440 --> 12:48.034
-We need to talk.
-About what?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.919
How l'll never be able to have
a meaningful relationship. . .

12:51.080 --> 12:53.389
. . .because of the way
you screwed me up.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.593
Well...

12:57.760 --> 12:59.830
...sorry about that.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.392
-Let me in.
-There's more?

13:03.560 --> 13:05.516
Yes.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.755
Will this having children thing
never end?

13:09.920 --> 13:11.353
Mom.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.997
Look, l'm sorry this is such a
major inconvenience for you, but--

13:19.160 --> 13:21.071
Oh, God.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.518
-What are you doing?
-Downward-Facing Dog.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.468
-What?
-lt's yoga, Charlie.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.549
Could your dog possibly face upward
while we talk?

13:34.160 --> 13:35.479
Fine.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.198
Jeez.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.351
What the hell is the mutt doing now?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.714
Charlie, just say
what you came to say.

13:43.560 --> 13:46.552
Okay, well, are you aware
that l'm a misogynist?

13:46.720 --> 13:50.269
Really? l raised you Episcopalian.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.354
This isn't funny.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.432
My anger and mistrust
towards women starts with you.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.909
Wasn't a problem
till it spilled into my sex life.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.718
So you're blaming Mommy. . .

13:59.880 --> 14:02.474
. . .because Little Charlie
can't come out and play?

14:02.640 --> 14:05.871
Okay, first of all,
we don't call it ''Little Charlie. ''

14:06.360 --> 14:07.793
What do we call it, darling?

14:07.960 --> 14:10.076
We don't call it anything.

14:10.240 --> 14:14.552
Well, when you were a baby
we called it Mr. Pinky.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.997
l may never have sex again.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.068
Oh, wait a sec.
Mr. Pinky was the cat.

14:20.240 --> 14:23.437
-What did we call your penis?
-lt doesn't matter.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.591
The point is it isn't working anymore.

14:25.760 --> 14:29.150
And somehow it's all tied up
in some sick, twisted knot with you.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.038
Mr. Pee-pee.

14:31.200 --> 14:35.432
That's it. Well, you can see why
l confused that with Mr. Pinky.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.388
Mom, l learned about relationships
from watching you.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.710
And you know
what toxic little lessons l learned?

14:43.880 --> 14:46.553
-Tell me, sweetheart.
-Men who get emotionally involved. . .

14:46.720 --> 14:47.994
. . .get stepped on.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.549
l learned that men who get married
get emasculated.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.950
That the best way
to not get your heart broken. . .

14:53.120 --> 14:55.270
. . .is to pretend you don't have one.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.150
-You learned all that from me?
-Yes.

14:58.320 --> 15:01.949
Darling, l've never been more proud
of you than l am at this moment.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.478
-You're joking, right?
-Not at all.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.916
For the first time l look at you
and l see myself.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.673
Oh, that's just insane.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.230
Save room for dessert.
l bought brownies.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.119
No, thanks.
Brownies just remind me of cupcakes.

15:28.720 --> 15:32.030
-His little girlfriend dumped him.
-Really?

15:32.200 --> 15:34.794
She said she needed her space.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.796
-l'm sorry, buddy.
-Want some advice?

15:39.320 --> 15:41.880
Yeah.
What do l do, Uncle Charlie?

15:45.640 --> 15:46.993
l meant from me.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.151
No, thank you.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.200
-Well?
-You might as well listen to your dad. . .

15:54.360 --> 15:55.839
. . .because l got nothing.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.911
Less than him?

15:58.840 --> 16:02.515
Fellas, l am the sick puppy
of a downward dog.

16:04.320 --> 16:08.359
Only thing l'm good for is drinking out
of the toilet and sniffing my own ass.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.755
Which, by the way,
l saw our mother do earlier.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.036
Okay, what do you think?

16:25.320 --> 16:27.709
-Marco.
-Oh, jeez.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.397
-Don't do that.
-Sorry.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.075
-Are you okay?
-Oh, sure.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.437
Everything l believed in is wrong.
Everything l thought l was l'm not.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.955
And Mr. Pee-pee's on the fritz.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.749
-Mr. Pee-pee?
-Yeah, it's what my mother used to--

16:42.920 --> 16:45.832
-Don't make me explain this, Rose.
-Okay.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.958
-But he's on the fritz, you say.
-Yes.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.793
Well, l'm not surprised.
The depth of your pathology. . .

16:51.960 --> 16:55.032
. . .coupled with your denial
was bound to manifest itself. . .

16:55.200 --> 16:56.599
. . .physically sooner or later.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.513
ln plain, simple English, Rose.

16:59.920 --> 17:04.071
When your mind gets crazy,
Mr. Pee-pee gets lazy.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.752
l'll put it in another way.

17:07.920 --> 17:11.549
When your psyche gets iffy,
you can't get a stiffy.

17:11.720 --> 17:15.269
Stop it. Stop it.
Just tell me how l can fix it.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.150
Oh, there's no quick fix,
when it comes to limp--

17:18.319 --> 17:19.992
Rose.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.038
-No more rhymes.
-You sure?

17:22.200 --> 17:24.111
l got a beauty with ''toner. ''

17:25.920 --> 17:27.272
Okay.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.795
Well, traditional therapy can help. . .

17:29.960 --> 17:33.555
. . .but you'll have to commit to a long,
arduous process of self-exploration. . .

17:33.720 --> 17:35.392
. . .over a period of years.

17:35.560 --> 17:40.839
Years?
l can't go years without Mr. Pee-pee.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.992
Charlie, isn't your long-term
mental and emotional health. . .

17:44.160 --> 17:46.879
. . .more important
than a few fleeting orgasms?

17:47.400 --> 17:50.437
lt's not even
more important than one.

17:51.920 --> 17:57.836
Well, in that case, l suppose we
could try a shortcut like hypnotherapy.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.556
-You know how to do that?
-l studied it.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.871
But for it to work,
you'd have to trust me completely.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.711
You know, Rose,
as strange as it may seem. . .

18:06.880 --> 18:10.634
. . .out of all the women l know,
you're the only one l trust at all.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.396
Personally, l find that very flattering. . .

18:13.560 --> 18:16.950
. . .while professionally,
it's deeply disturbing.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.993
Oh, well.

18:20.160 --> 18:25.996
So just relax, sit back,
close your eyes. . .

18:26.160 --> 18:29.232
. . .and listen only
to the sound of my voice.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.596
l wanna get my mother
out of my head, okay?

18:31.760 --> 18:34.354
l don't wanna quit drinking,
gambling or any good stuff.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.554
Got it. Okay.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.392
So just relax.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.470
Oh, my.
l see everything's back to normal.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.358
Better than normal.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.398
-Did you take one of those pills?
-l don't need any pills.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.391
lt's all me.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.678
And nobody else.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.955
Why don't you relax while l introduce
you to the new, improved Charlie?

19:23.920 --> 19:27.435
-Who were you calling?
-l was just ordering a little chicken.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.359
What smells so good?

19:38.920 --> 19:41.354
Your kid's in the kitchen baking.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.557
-You're kidding.
-Hey, Dad. Want a cupcake?

19:46.280 --> 19:48.077
Sure.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.038
Uncle Charlie?

19:50.200 --> 19:51.713
Thank you.

19:51.880 --> 19:55.077
Have as many as you want.
l've got another batch in the oven.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.593
That's very tasty.
What prompted this?

19:58.760 --> 20:03.197
l figured out l don't need a girlfriend.
lf l want a cupcake, l make it myself.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.397
Taking matters into his own hands.

20:07.160 --> 20:10.197
The metaphor is now complete.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.032
Anybody wanna lick the beater?

20:16.160 --> 20:17.718
-No.
-No.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.751
What?

20:54.400 --> 20:56.391
