WEBVTT

00:06.466 --> 00:09.010
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:16.119 --> 01:17.412
MACKENZIE: <i>Here's where we are.</i>

01:17.495 --> 01:19.956
<i>August 24 of last year</i>
<i>we had a guest on a panel</i>

01:20.039 --> 01:22.167
<i>about drones named Cyrus West,</i>

01:22.250 --> 01:25.587
<i>a retired Air Force captain</i>
<i>who now teaches at the Maxwell School.</i>

01:25.670 --> 01:29.048
When the panel was done,
Captain West gave Jerry a tip

01:29.132 --> 01:31.593
about a black op with the codename Genoa.

01:31.676 --> 01:33.636
What did he tell you about Genoa?

01:33.720 --> 01:36.014
He told me that in March 2009, two Marines

01:36.097 --> 01:38.266
were separated from
their unit in the Hindu Kush.

01:38.349 --> 01:41.853
Intelligence told us
that they were captured by Taliban fighters,

01:41.936 --> 01:45.064
taken across the border into Pakistan,
held in a small village,

01:45.148 --> 01:46.691
and in a matter of a few hours

01:46.775 --> 01:49.569
they were gonna be sold
to al-Qaeda and publically beheaded.

01:49.652 --> 01:52.447
MACKENZIE: A MARSOC unit was
deployed to attempt an extraction.

01:52.530 --> 01:56.409
Two MH-60s, Black Hawks,
came in with 15 MARSOCs apiece.

01:56.493 --> 01:59.245
The first unit was overrun by the enemy
and trapped behind cover.

01:59.329 --> 02:02.123
- They were wearing MOPP gear.
- Mission Oriented Protective Posture.

02:02.207 --> 02:03.708
The second unit, also in MOPP gear,

02:03.792 --> 02:06.044
came in and successfully
extracted the prisoners

02:06.127 --> 02:07.796
as well as the first MARSOC unit.

02:07.879 --> 02:10.423
- How?
- By dropping sarin gas on the village.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.641
How would the prisoners have survived?

02:19.724 --> 02:21.351
We hit them with atropine
and dragged them onto the helos.

02:21.434 --> 02:23.812
- Everyone else was wearing MOPP gear.
- Everyone but the civilians.

02:23.895 --> 02:26.856
MACKENZIE: That was Cyrus West's story
and that was last August.

02:26.940 --> 02:30.485
Jerry then tracked down
a retired gunnery sergeant, Eric Sweeney.

02:30.568 --> 02:32.028
Jerry and I met with Sergeant Sweeney

02:32.111 --> 02:36.658
and the full transcript of that meeting
begins on page four in your binders.

02:36.741 --> 02:38.535
Sweeney describes rehearsals
for the mission...

02:38.618 --> 02:40.995
- In MOPP gear.
- ...and then describes the mission itself.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.290
He witnesses blinding smoke
and women and children

02:44.374 --> 02:45.834
with boils and burns on their faces.

02:45.917 --> 02:47.877
Back on the helicopter
he asks another member of his crew

02:47.961 --> 02:50.755
what that was all about
and he's told it was sarin.

02:50.839 --> 02:52.841
MACKENZIE: Jerry put a team together
to track down other members

02:52.924 --> 02:55.510
of the crew and any ground support,
but no one was talking.

02:55.593 --> 02:58.096
Neal then did a search
of any tweets from the area

02:58.179 --> 03:00.932
sent around March '09
and came up with Hamni8.

03:01.099 --> 03:03.059
The tweets from Hamni8
would seem to be describing

03:03.142 --> 03:06.062
what we'd heard
from Sergeant Sweeney and from Cyrus West.

03:06.145 --> 03:07.397
"Helicopters. Grenades."

03:07.480 --> 03:09.649
Then a moment later,
"Men in gas masks. Machine guns."

03:09.732 --> 03:12.819
A moment later, "Burning."
Then, "Americans. White smoke."

03:12.902 --> 03:15.488
Then, "Two helicopters.
No markings on them, but they're American."

03:15.572 --> 03:17.866
It's 32 minutes before the next tweet.

03:17.949 --> 03:19.617
"I think everyone's dead."

03:19.742 --> 03:22.745
MACKENZIE: We believe the reason for
the 32-minute gap is frequency hopping.

03:22.829 --> 03:24.581
We'd have jammed
the radio frequencies cell phones use.

03:24.664 --> 03:27.292
West is one, Sweeney is two, Hamni8 is three.

03:27.375 --> 03:30.628
Four is a humanitarian report
from a guy named Leon Deit.

03:30.712 --> 03:34.007
Deit was in the region working for an NGO

03:34.090 --> 03:38.303
and traveled to the site of the extraction
on verbal reports of a mass grave.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.180
The eyewitness accounts
are consistent with the use of sarin gas.

03:41.264 --> 03:44.225
And as you can see, the report includes

03:44.309 --> 03:45.685
pictures of the victims.

03:45.768 --> 03:49.230
Five is a confidential source
who confirmed the story

03:49.314 --> 03:52.108
and provided a copy
of the munitions manifest.

03:52.191 --> 03:55.612
The manifest included this item, MX-76.

03:55.695 --> 03:59.824
MX-76 doesn't exist.
It's a euphemism for classified material.

03:59.908 --> 04:02.869
We believe it's the sarin canisters.

04:02.952 --> 04:04.746
MACKENZIE: The five of us
as well as some other staffers

04:04.829 --> 04:06.873
have had a role in putting this together so far.

04:06.956 --> 04:09.250
We've purposely kept
a number of people out of the loop

04:09.334 --> 04:12.170
including Will for fresh eyes.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.297
Are there any questions?

04:21.512 --> 04:23.473
- Sarin gas?
- MACKENZIE: I don't believe it, either.

04:23.556 --> 04:27.060
I also don't believe in Santa Claus,
but if I saw eight reindeer take flight...

04:27.143 --> 04:28.770
To be clear, you haven't seen eight reindeer.

04:28.853 --> 04:30.855
You've talked to someone
who says he's seen eight reindeer.

04:30.939 --> 04:32.899
And we have someone
who's tweeted about the reindeer

04:32.982 --> 04:35.777
and a third witness
who's interviewed victims of the reindeer

04:35.860 --> 04:38.613
and a highly-placed
confidential source who's confirmed

04:38.696 --> 04:41.157
that in this place at that time, reindeer flew.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.035
It couldn't matter less,
but Santa Claus has nine reindeer.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.620
- Rudolph.
- Mac, I don't think...

04:45.703 --> 04:47.372
- Dasher, Dancer.
- Vixen, Blitzen.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.165
- How many was that?
- It really doesn't matter.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.625
- You believe we used sarin?
- Yes.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.043
- On civilians?
- Yes.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.628
- Dasher, Dancer, Prancer.
- What are you doing?

04:53.711 --> 04:55.171
Well, I'm digesting what I just heard.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.965
I'm doing a fact check
on the number of reindeer.

04:57.048 --> 04:59.300
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer,
Comet, Blitzen, Cupid,

04:59.384 --> 05:01.803
Donner, Vixen, and somebody else.

05:01.886 --> 05:02.971
- Rudolph.
- Thank you.

05:03.054 --> 05:04.305
- Wait, how many was that?
- Start again.

05:04.389 --> 05:06.140
No. Do we even have sarin gas?

05:06.224 --> 05:09.143
We aren't supposed to.
It was supposed to be destroyed by 2007

05:09.227 --> 05:10.770
according to the
Chemical Weapons Convention.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.939
But it wasn't. We still have it.
The DOD confirms that.

05:13.022 --> 05:14.607
We may have it, but we've never used it.

05:14.691 --> 05:19.028
We didn't use it in World War II,
Korea, Vietnam, the first Gulf War,

05:19.112 --> 05:20.989
and we were fighting people that did have...

05:21.072 --> 05:22.740
Those all happened before 9/11.

05:24.575 --> 05:27.161
We torture people now.
We kidnap them, wiretap them...

05:27.245 --> 05:30.665
- Drop deadly gas on civilians?
- It happened, Jim.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.709
This is the one we know about.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.919
- The original tip came from Cyrus West?
- MACKENZIE: I know, but...

05:35.003 --> 05:38.172
- JIM: He's not reliable.
- His crime was not being good on television.

05:38.256 --> 05:40.508
But he led us to Eric Sweeney, so who cares?

05:40.591 --> 05:41.592
What about the Marines who were rescued?

05:41.676 --> 05:42.760
MACKENZIE: We don't know their names

05:42.844 --> 05:45.096
and they wouldn't have been
in a good position to know what happened.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.056
Sweeney says they were in a hole
in back of one of the houses.

05:47.140 --> 05:48.182
And then they were exposed to the gas.

05:48.266 --> 05:49.851
They would have known
if they were hit with an atropine.

05:49.934 --> 05:51.686
Probably, but it doesn't matter.
We don't know who they are

05:51.769 --> 05:52.854
and we've been looking for seven months.

05:52.937 --> 05:55.481
We have 30 names and here they are.

05:55.565 --> 05:57.275
These were given to us by Sweeney.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.943
None of them is talking with the exception

05:59.027 --> 06:01.487
of Lance Corporal Herman Valenzuela
who's dead.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.866
It sounded like you said Herman Valenzuela,

06:04.949 --> 06:06.534
in spite of being dead, is talking.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.202
- I wasn't saying that.
- I was confused by that, too.

06:08.286 --> 06:10.496
Valenzuela was killed in action,
the other 29 aren't talking.

06:10.580 --> 06:12.081
What about Hamni8?
Have you tried to track him down?

06:12.165 --> 06:14.542
Yes, but he's gone.
We believe given his proximity to the raid

06:14.625 --> 06:15.877
that he was killed.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.837
Well, or that he couldn't pay for his cell plan.

06:18.129 --> 06:19.630
Those are two pretty different things.

06:19.714 --> 06:22.341
DON: Have we put boots on the ground to
see if there's any locals we can talk to?

06:22.425 --> 06:24.510
You can't send Americans in there
or anyone working for Americans.

06:24.594 --> 06:25.887
- A local fixer?
- MACKENZIE: It's much too dangerous.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.055
- What does Tapley say?
- JERRY: Who?

06:27.138 --> 06:29.015
Mike Tapley, our military analyst,

06:29.098 --> 06:30.683
who I don't know why
we didn't use him instead of West.

06:30.767 --> 06:32.351
'Cause I was producing the segment.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.437
Neither Mike nor our Pentagon correspondent
have been brought in.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.897
JERRY: The Pentagon
would go into shutdown.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.565
We'll ask for comment 24 hours before air.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.069
Before air?

06:41.152 --> 06:42.945
We're really talking about...

06:43.029 --> 06:45.782
Charlie, be the voice of reason.

06:45.865 --> 06:47.158
I think it happened

06:47.241 --> 06:49.994
and I think
we're two inches away from proving it.

06:50.078 --> 06:52.121
It's always 50-50 when you ask Charlie
to be the voice of reason.

06:52.205 --> 06:54.165
- Nobody's saying it's ready to air.
- I'm saying it's ready.

06:54.248 --> 06:55.291
CHARLIE: It certainly is not.

06:55.374 --> 06:59.337
And we can keep calling the names
on the list till St. Swithin's Day,

06:59.420 --> 07:02.090
but we have a better chance of
getting Herman Valenzuela to talk

07:02.173 --> 07:03.758
than any of the other 29.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.385
So we started looking
for someone not on the list.

07:06.469 --> 07:09.013
A flag officer who'd be
in a position to confirm the mission. Neal?

07:09.180 --> 07:11.099
We ran five separate searches
and cross-referenced

07:11.182 --> 07:13.059
the five search parameters
which were the following,

07:13.142 --> 07:16.938
recently retired generals who have attempted
to publish work that was heavily redacted,

07:17.021 --> 07:18.356
commanders who have served as head

07:18.439 --> 07:20.525
of the Marines Combat Logistics
and Munitions Element,

07:20.608 --> 07:23.569
generals who've taken
academic positions since retiring

07:23.653 --> 07:26.364
who've been critical
of the US stockpile of chemical weapons,

07:26.447 --> 07:29.117
and flag officers who were on active duty
when Genoa took place.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.660
When we think Genoa took place.

07:30.743 --> 07:33.955
There's one name that meets all five criteria.

07:34.038 --> 07:37.458
This is three-star Marine
General Stanislaus Stomtonovich.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.293
He was a munitions consultant at White Sands

07:39.377 --> 07:41.462
and an expert on the US
chemical weapons program.

07:41.546 --> 07:44.173
He retired six months
after Genoa and lives in Silver Spring.

07:44.257 --> 07:46.968
You're gonna call and ask him
if we dropped sarin gas on a small village?

07:47.051 --> 07:48.886
- No, we're going to his house.
- Charlie, God damn it.

07:48.970 --> 07:51.264
JERRY: He's already alerted
the Pentagon's Office of Public Affairs.

07:51.347 --> 07:54.308
He thinks we're coming about something else.
We're just getting in the vestibule.

07:54.392 --> 07:56.519
But eventually, you will ask him the question?

07:57.145 --> 07:59.063
Yeah.

07:59.564 --> 08:01.524
Do you understand
what we're accusing them of?

08:01.607 --> 08:03.860
We do, Jim, yeah.
And I think we're less concerned

08:03.943 --> 08:06.362
with what we're accusing
them of than we are with what they did.

08:06.445 --> 08:08.489
What you think they did,
which I still can't hardly believe

08:08.573 --> 08:10.491
my fucking ears we're even talking about.

08:10.575 --> 08:12.577
- What was the general's name?
- Stomtonovich.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.913
How are you gonna question Stomtonovich
without him knowing what you're asking?

08:15.997 --> 08:18.416
We're gonna ask him how chemical weapons
would be stored and deployed.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.501
- JIM: What's the cover story?
- Libya.

08:24.297 --> 08:26.174
You've been on this for seven months?

08:28.509 --> 08:30.136
Do you believe the story?

08:30.386 --> 08:31.512
(SIGHS)

08:31.888 --> 08:33.306
I don't know.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.308
Have we nailed down the number of reindeer?

08:36.017 --> 08:37.310
(RINGING)

08:39.770 --> 08:41.022
<i>I see you.</i>

08:41.105 --> 08:42.940
You seem really excited every time this works.

08:43.065 --> 08:45.985
Is it because you're seeing me
or is it because of the technology?

08:46.068 --> 08:47.987
<i>- The technology.</i>
- I get that.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.281
<i>But tomorrow night</i>
<i>it'll be because I'm seeing you.</i>

08:50.364 --> 08:52.575
I'll tell you why
you should be excited about tomorrow night.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.368
I got a suite at the Soho Grand.

08:54.452 --> 08:56.412
- It cost three years' salary.
<i>- I like you.</i>

08:56.495 --> 08:58.789
- That's such great news for me.
<i>- It really is.</i>

08:58.873 --> 09:02.460
So I'll pick you up at the event at 10:00.
I'll be out in the lobby. We'll go to dinner

09:02.543 --> 09:06.297
and then back to the hotel for,
you know, discretionary time.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.841
<i>- Speaking of dinner...</i>
- What's about to happen?

09:08.925 --> 09:10.927
<i>- Do you know Aubrey Lerner?</i>
- No.

09:11.010 --> 09:12.720
<i>- Her byline is AK.</i>
- I don't know her.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.305
<i>- AK Lerner.</i>
- I don't know her,

09:14.388 --> 09:16.599
but I feel like she's about to
be an obstacle in my path to...

09:16.682 --> 09:18.226
<i>- Discretionary time?</i>
- Yes.

09:18.309 --> 09:20.102
<i>No, she's been on the press plane</i>

09:20.186 --> 09:22.063
<i>for a couple of weeks</i>
<i>and she reports for mtvU.</i>

09:22.146 --> 09:24.899
It sounds like she'd have a really good time
staying home by herself tomorrow.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.484
I don't think you should rob her of that.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.277
<i>She stays at her parents' place</i>
<i>when she's in New York</i>

09:28.361 --> 09:31.239
<i>and I thought she could come out to</i>
<i>dinner with us tomorrow night</i>

09:31.322 --> 09:32.573
<i>and you could bring Neal.</i>

09:32.657 --> 09:34.075
<i>I think they'd really hit it off</i>

09:34.158 --> 09:35.576
<i>and you said he just broke up with somebody.</i>

09:35.660 --> 09:38.913
Neal's always just broken up with somebody.
He calls it going home in the morning.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.206
<i>It'll be a fun foursome.</i>

09:40.289 --> 09:42.541
<i>- Dinner and then straight to the hotel.</i>
- How many of us?

09:42.625 --> 09:45.336
<i>Jim, I'll have just finished covering</i>
<i>a $5,000-a-plate dinner.</i>

09:45.419 --> 09:46.963
<i>I'll be in cocktail attire.</i>

Do it. Do it.

09:48.506 --> 09:50.466
Whatever she's asking to do, do it. Do it now.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.176
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

09:52.260 --> 09:55.012
<i>- Hey, Gary.</i>
- Hey, Hallie.

09:55.096 --> 09:57.974
In terms of what you're gonna be wearing,
could you describe exactly what...

09:58.057 --> 10:00.017
<i>I'll see you guys tomorrow at 10:00?</i>

10:00.101 --> 10:01.519
- In the ballroom lobby.
<i>- I've got to go.</i>

10:01.602 --> 10:03.437
I'll talk to you later.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.610
<i>Harry Truman dubbed the 80th</i>
<i>Congress the "Do-Nothing Congress."</i>

10:09.694 --> 10:13.614
<i>Its productivity, measured by this bar,</i>
<i>shows the number of laws they passed.</i>

10:13.698 --> 10:17.285
<i>The productivity of the 1 12th</i>
<i>Congress is measured by this bar.</i>

10:17.368 --> 10:20.621
The 112th Congress has not yet
passed one sixth of the laws

10:20.705 --> 10:21.998
of the Do-Nothing Congress.

10:22.081 --> 10:24.792
But let's look at the laws they have passed.

10:24.875 --> 10:28.462
<i>Congressman Peter Roskam</i>
<i>represents the 6th District of Illinois.</i>

10:28.546 --> 10:30.673
<i>Illinois has the fourth</i>
<i>highest unemployment rate</i>

10:30.756 --> 10:34.051
<i>in the country with 9.9%</i>
<i>of its workforce out of work.</i>

10:34.135 --> 10:38.180
<i>So Congressman Roskam introduced</i>
<i>House Resolution 21-39,</i>

10:38.264 --> 10:40.433
<i>which would require</i>
<i>the Secretary of the Treasury</i>

10:40.516 --> 10:44.937
<i>to mint coins in commemoration</i>
<i>of the centennial of the Lions Club.</i>

10:45.021 --> 10:46.856
Congressman Randy Forbes of Virginia

10:46.939 --> 10:50.735
sponsored a bill reaffirming
"In God We Trust" as our national motto,

10:50.818 --> 10:53.779
a motto already made official in 1956,

10:53.863 --> 10:57.658
2002, 2006 and now 2011.

10:57.742 --> 11:00.036
One in four American children
are living in poverty,

11:00.119 --> 11:01.829
but the motto should take care of that.

11:01.912 --> 11:04.457
<i>We're fighting a war, a stagnant economy,</i>

11:04.540 --> 11:07.001
a failing education system
and climate change.

11:07.084 --> 11:11.547
The 112th Congress
has renamed 40 post offices.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.924
Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican

11:14.008 --> 11:15.509
<i>on the Senate Banking Committee,</i>

11:15.593 --> 11:18.095
<i>blocked the appointment</i>
<i>of MIT economist Peter Diamond</i>

11:18.220 --> 11:20.598
<i>to a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board.</i>

11:20.681 --> 11:24.101
<i>Said Shelby, "I do not believe</i>
<i>the current environment of uncertainty</i>

11:24.185 --> 11:26.437
<i>"would benefit from</i>
<i>monetary policy decisions</i>

11:26.520 --> 11:28.856
<i>"made by board members</i>
<i>who are learning on the job."</i>

11:28.939 --> 11:31.484
<i>While Senator Shelby held up</i>
<i>Peter Diamond's nomination</i>

11:31.567 --> 11:34.236
<i>on the grounds that Diamond</i>
<i>was insufficiently qualified</i>

11:34.320 --> 11:36.280
<i>to counsel the Federal Reserve Board,</i>

11:36.364 --> 11:38.741
<i>Peter Diamond won</i>

- You busy?
- No.

11:42.078 --> 11:45.039
Hey, this may sound nuts,
but I'm looking at the movie <i>John Carter</i>

11:45.122 --> 11:46.749
as a possible subject
for my <i>News Night</i> segment.

11:46.832 --> 11:47.917
What about it?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.252
Well, it's about a Civil War Confederate officer

11:50.336 --> 11:52.713
who's transported to Mars,
which is a lush planet

11:52.797 --> 11:54.548
inhabited by 12-foot-tall barbarians.

11:54.632 --> 11:56.384
Because of his different bone density

11:56.467 --> 11:57.885
and the planet's low gravity,
John Carter can jump...

11:57.968 --> 12:00.638
I said, "What about it?" not,
"What's it about?" Also, you know, spoilers.

12:00.721 --> 12:03.224
Okay, well, it's projected to
lose about 200 million for Disney.

12:03.307 --> 12:04.642
You want to do the economics of Hollywood?

12:04.725 --> 12:07.061
Say what you want,
but they're one of the few American industries

12:07.144 --> 12:08.646
still making a product people want to buy.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.356
Doesn't sound like
they want to buy <i>John Carter.</i>

12:10.439 --> 12:12.316
Well, that's my point.
Nobody's gonna ask for a bailout

12:12.400 --> 12:14.276
and Disney stock is relatively safe.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.321
Entertainment is one of our
highest revenue-generating exports

12:17.405 --> 12:19.657
and they employ members
of 17 different unions,

12:19.740 --> 12:22.410
all of which have excellent
minimum basic contracts.

12:22.493 --> 12:25.037
They may take it in the teeth on <i>John Carter,</i>
but nobody's gonna get hurt.

12:25.121 --> 12:26.622
It's still early. It's just a first idea.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.666
- Yeah, no, it sounds good.
- What are you doing?

12:28.749 --> 12:30.584
Looking at last night's show.

12:30.668 --> 12:32.503
- They did a focus group?
- No.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.588
There are dial lines
on the bottom of the screen.

12:34.672 --> 12:37.299
Yeah, those are just... That's...

12:37.383 --> 12:39.051
What's going on?

12:39.135 --> 12:40.845
I did a focus group. I did it myself.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.847
I called our company and did it on my own.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.599
They did the dials
and a moderator got comments after.

12:45.683 --> 12:47.518
- Why?
- Why?

12:47.601 --> 12:49.103
- Yeah.
- To check in.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.604
Why does a politician take polls?

12:50.688 --> 12:52.606
To find out what people
want him to say the next day.

12:52.690 --> 12:53.941
Are you comfortable with that analogy?

12:54.024 --> 12:56.527
Charlie doesn't allow me
to be tested anymore.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.487
So I did it myself.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.782
We have kind of
a big brother-little sister relationship.

13:01.866 --> 13:03.451
- Which one are you?
- And the little sister always ends up

13:03.534 --> 13:05.619
chewing out the big brother
and he says, "Thanks, sis."

13:05.786 --> 13:07.621
This is on Nickelodeon?

13:07.705 --> 13:10.458
- Never mind.
- Are you preparing for a chewing out?

13:12.251 --> 13:13.878
Nah.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.963
You forgot to ask me
how the test scores were.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.298
I didn't forget.

13:23.554 --> 13:25.014
I can't see any numbers yet.

13:25.097 --> 13:27.433
All right, you look on the right side,
I'll look on the left side.

13:27.516 --> 13:30.311
I'm already on the left side.
Why don't you look on the right side?

14:03.052 --> 14:04.929
We're just gonna get this cleaned up.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.972
Were you texting?

14:07.056 --> 14:09.725
No, sir. It was regular negligence.

14:36.669 --> 14:38.504
We made an appointment
to see you here at your house.

- Do we still have chemical weapons?

15:35.519 --> 15:36.604
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:36.687 --> 15:38.522
- We do?
- Yeah.

15:38.856 --> 15:41.567
Do you believe chemical weapons
are a legitimate weapon of war?

15:41.692 --> 15:44.111
I believe chemical weapons,
like any other weapons,

15:44.194 --> 15:46.280
are tools to be used to kill the enemy.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.741
Which tool you use
depends on battlefield circumstance.

15:48.824 --> 15:50.701
- And collateral damage?
- It doesn't make much difference

15:50.784 --> 15:53.912
to the collateral damage
whether it's damage by gas

15:53.996 --> 15:55.414
or a Hellfire missile, does it?

15:55.497 --> 15:57.708
So you think chemical weapons
should be part of our arsenal?

15:57.791 --> 15:59.209
Part of ours, not Libya's.

15:59.293 --> 16:01.795
Do you think
we should be able to use chemical weapons?

- We think you do.
- Yeah?

16:14.016 --> 16:16.185
During a speech
at the War College two years ago,

16:16.268 --> 16:19.229
you were openly critical
of the destruction of our stockpiles.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.857
You've commissioned
two studies citing the potential need

16:21.940 --> 16:23.859
for chemical weapons in combat situations

16:23.942 --> 16:27.279
and your book was so heavily redacted
that all that was left were pronouns.

16:27.363 --> 16:29.365
Why are you two big shots

We know about Genoa.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.971
You can't touch a shooter
while he's in the process of shooting the ball.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.473
It's against the rules.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.934
Shooter goes to the foul line,
takes two free throws.

16:57.017 --> 17:00.354
But what happens
if the shooter brandishes a knife?

17:00.562 --> 17:04.525
He's dribbling the ball
and he suddenly takes out a switchblade.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.527
You're allowed to grab his arm now

17:06.610 --> 17:09.988

basketball anymore.

17:17.413 --> 17:19.081
Can you confirm that Genoa happened?

17:19.164 --> 17:22.167
Why would I confirm, even off the record,
the existence of a classified mission?

17:22.251 --> 17:24.378
Because you believe
very strongly that if the shooter

17:24.461 --> 17:28.340
takes a knife out,
it shouldn't be illegal to grab his arm.

We won't have any more communication
after this unless it's necessary.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.548
How did he find it... Dantana?

18:09.631 --> 18:11.592
How did he find the story?

18:11.675 --> 18:13.469
Just a lucky tip.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.846
<i>And then very late in my political career,</i>

18:15.929 --> 18:18.849
<i>I had the opportunity</i>

18:19.516 --> 18:22.102
The speech that almost made
Senator Santorum vomit

18:22.186 --> 18:25.814
was given by John F. Kennedy
in Houston, Texas, in 1960.

18:25.898 --> 18:28.442
The presidential candidate
was answering concerns

18:28.525 --> 18:31.361
that his Catholicism
would be his compass in the Oval Office.

18:31.445 --> 18:33.947
And the Houston speech
made a forceful argument

18:34.031 --> 18:37.785
for a firewall between
religion, any religion, and government.

- Mr. Dell, welcome.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.504
<i>The common wisdom</i>

DELL: <i>I agree with that.</i>

18:51.548 --> 18:54.551
<i>But what if a candidate makes their religious</i>

<i>to President Obama's climate change agenda.</i>

19:13.237 --> 19:16.073
<i>"It's not about your quality of life.</i>
<i>It's not about your jobs.</i>

19:16.156 --> 19:19.368
<i>"It's about some phony ideal.</i>
<i>Some phony theology.</i>

19:19.451 --> 19:22.996
"Oh, not a theology based on the Bible.
A different theology."

19:23.080 --> 19:25.249
Mr. Dell, one of Rick Santorum's problems

19:25.332 --> 19:27.501
with the president's plan
to combat climate change

19:27.584 --> 19:29.419
is that its roots can't be found in the Bible.

19:29.503 --> 19:32.047
<i>We have a lot of reasons to be</i>
<i>concerned with Obama's plans,</i>

19:32.130 --> 19:34.299
<i>but you're plainly distorting</i>
<i>Rick Santorum's words.</i>

19:34.383 --> 19:36.218
WILL: I don't think I am,
but let's go to this instead.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.469
- HERB: 17B.
- Up.

19:37.553 --> 19:38.804
- Thirty seconds.
- Let it go long.

19:38.887 --> 19:42.182
WILL:...<i>at the Press and People of Faith</i>
<i>in Politics forum in 2008.</i>

19:42.266 --> 19:44.935
<i>"I think there are</i>
<i>a lot of problems with the theory of evolution</i>

19:45.018 --> 19:46.770
<i>"and I do believe it is used to promote</i>

19:46.854 --> 19:49.398
<i>"a world view</i>
<i>that is anti-theist, that is atheist.</i>

19:49.481 --> 19:52.609
"You should have academic freedom
in the classroom when teaching about life."

19:52.693 --> 19:55.070
- DELL: <i>That was 2008. Mr. Santorum...</i>
- Ready 18.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.613
<i>...made those remarks</i>
<i>when he didn't hold office.</i>

19:56.697 --> 19:58.365
<i>- He was speaking as a private citizen.</i>
- Ready.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.450
- HERB: Go.
- He was speaking in defense of an amendment

20:00.534 --> 20:03.078
he offered in 2001 when he was a US Senator,

20:03.161 --> 20:06.456
making it a federal law that,
"Where topics are taught

20:06.540 --> 20:09.459
<i>"that may generate controversy,</i>
<i>such as biological evolution,</i>

20:09.543 --> 20:11.461
<i>"the curriculum should help</i>
<i>students to understand</i>

20:11.545 --> 20:14.214
<i>"the full range of scientific views that exist."</i>

20:14.298 --> 20:16.049
<i>By full range of scientific views,</i>

20:16.133 --> 20:18.176
- he's including Genesis, right?
<i>- That's right.</i>

20:18.260 --> 20:20.178
It seems like far from objecting that religion

20:20.262 --> 20:22.764
be brought up in political campaigns,
he's insisting on it.

20:22.848 --> 20:25.350
<i>And here's Rick Santorum's opponent,</i>
<i>Mitt Romney,</i>

20:25.434 --> 20:27.227
<i>- asking us not to ask about his religion.</i>
- 22.

20:27.311 --> 20:29.897
<i>That idea that we should choose people</i>

20:29.980 --> 20:32.733
<i>based upon their religion for public office</i>

20:32.816 --> 20:35.027
<i>is what I find to be most troubling,</i>

20:35.110 --> 20:37.571
<i>because the founders of this country</i>
<i>went to great length</i>

20:37.654 --> 20:40.616
<i>to make sure,</i>
<i>and even put it in the Constitution,</i>

20:40.699 --> 20:43.076
<i>that we would not choose</i>
<i>people who represent us</i>

20:43.160 --> 20:44.620
<i>in government based upon their religion.</i>

20:44.703 --> 20:47.164
And now here he is invoking his religion.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.416
<i>The Declaration of Independence</i>
<i>established our rights</i>

20:49.499 --> 20:53.462
<i>by saying that they were created</i>
<i>not by government, but by the Creator.</i>

20:53.545 --> 20:56.632
<i>We are endowed</i>
<i>by our Creator with certain unalienable rights.</i>

20:56.715 --> 20:58.926
<i>I will fight to preserve America's tradition</i>
<i>as a religious nation.</i>

20:59.009 --> 21:00.135
(APPLAUSE ON TAPE)

21:00.218 --> 21:02.471
So, can we really not ask
these candidates questions

21:02.554 --> 21:04.431
about what they believe
with regard to religion?

21:04.514 --> 21:05.599
<i>Well, like what?</i>

21:05.682 --> 21:09.102
Like is it important that you and I
have the same definition of "creator"?

21:09.186 --> 21:10.562
<i>They plainly meant God.</i>

21:10.646 --> 21:12.189
<i>That's not plain to everybody.</i>

21:12.814 --> 21:16.068
Like right there.
Just a smile would have made it folksier.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.570
Also, honey,
you've got to stay away from religion.

21:18.654 --> 21:19.988
You know you're just asking for it.

21:20.072 --> 21:21.490
What else am I supposed to talk about

21:21.573 --> 21:23.033
with the President
of the League of Catholic Voters?

21:23.116 --> 21:25.786
You don't have him on as a guest.
That's another thing.

21:25.869 --> 21:28.288
You want guests that don't
make you look so combative.

21:28.372 --> 21:30.248
That's why your likability numbers are down.

21:30.374 --> 21:32.125
- I don't know. I think I'm likable.
- I think you're lovable.

21:32.209 --> 21:35.253
- Thank you.
- But your numbers are problematic.

21:36.546 --> 21:40.968
Listen to me, I'd like dinner to last
10 to 15 minutes.

21:41.051 --> 21:42.469
You don't like to linger.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.471
I'm doing my lingering
somewhere else tonight,

21:44.554 --> 21:46.974
so we're not ordering
anything that takes a long time to prepare.

21:47.057 --> 21:49.643
We're not ordering anything well-done.
We're not ordering anything cooked.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.061
It's okay with me if we don't order anything.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.604
It's not going to be okay with the restaurant.

21:52.688 --> 21:53.814
Screw the restaurant, Neal.

21:53.897 --> 21:56.400
The restaurant hasn't
not seen his girlfriend in a month.

21:56.483 --> 22:00.070
The restaurant's girlfriend
isn't wearing cocktail attire.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.531
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

22:02.614 --> 22:05.492
Six minutes and 20 seconds.

22:05.659 --> 22:07.077
God, it's you.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.037
That's how long you spent
tonight on Etch-a-Sketch.

22:09.663 --> 22:12.499
- Six minutes and 20 seconds.
- Hey, Taylor.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.418
- Hi, Jim.
- You look very nice.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.753
- Thank you.
- This is Neal Sampat. We work together.

22:16.837 --> 22:19.131
Neal, this is Taylor Warren,
a Romney campaign spokesman.

22:19.214 --> 22:21.508
- Woman... Spokesperson.
- Nice to meet you.

22:21.591 --> 22:23.301
- You work for ACN?
- Yes.

22:23.427 --> 22:26.179
I loathe you in ways that are unquantifiable.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.848
Cool.

22:27.931 --> 22:30.434
- You must be excited to see Hallie.
- I am.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.562
I mentioned to Hallie that I didn't have
anything to do in the city tonight.

22:33.645 --> 22:34.688
No.

22:34.771 --> 22:36.440
And she said
that I should join you guys for dinner.

22:37.774 --> 22:40.861
(LAUGHS) You should see
the look on your face.

22:40.944 --> 22:43.196
Don't worry, I know you had
a special night planned,

22:43.280 --> 22:45.198
so of course I'm coming along.
You know why?

22:45.282 --> 22:46.575
Because we spent
six minutes and 20 seconds...

22:46.658 --> 22:47.784
On Etch-a-Sketch, yeah.

22:47.868 --> 22:50.287
- It was a story and you know it.
- No, it was a gaffe and you know it.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.165
He came out and said, "Don't worry about
anything I've said during the primary.

22:53.248 --> 22:54.666
"I can be whatever you want me to be."

22:54.750 --> 22:56.209
He didn't say it. Fehrnstrom did.

22:56.293 --> 22:57.794
And how do you expect us to juggle

22:57.878 --> 23:00.589
very diverse coalitions
inside the Republican party?

23:00.672 --> 23:03.341
- Really glad I came tonight.
- There's no way you're coming to dinner.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.718
Jim.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.515
- I've missed you.
- You look amazing.

23:10.599 --> 23:12.017
- Plus?
- I've missed you, too.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.685
There it is. This is Aubrey.

23:13.769 --> 23:15.479
Hey, it's nice to meet you. Neal.

23:15.562 --> 23:18.356
Okay, full disclosure,
the press wasn't allowed any food,

23:18.440 --> 23:20.275
but we stole a couple bottles of Chardonnay

23:20.358 --> 23:22.402
- and I am wicked hammered.
- Okay.

23:22.486 --> 23:25.697
- Neal, this is Aubrey.
- Hey.

23:25.781 --> 23:26.823
- Nice to meet you.
- Full disclosure...

23:26.907 --> 23:28.075
The press wasn't allowed any food,

23:28.158 --> 23:29.618
but we stole a couple bottles of Chardonnay...

23:29.701 --> 23:31.703
- Wicked hammered.
- You said that already.

23:31.787 --> 23:33.246
We're gonna get some food in your stomach.

23:33.330 --> 23:35.248
Maybe that's not necessary.

23:36.333 --> 23:39.336
So, listen, Taylor's kind of sad tonight.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.296
I don't know why,
so I asked her to come to dinner.

23:41.379 --> 23:43.090
She's not sad. She's mad 'cause we did

23:43.173 --> 23:45.092
six minutes and 20 seconds on Etch-a-Sketch.

23:45.175 --> 23:48.053
And now I have to have a dinner with her
that could last up to a half hour.

23:48.136 --> 23:49.846
You're afraid of Taylor.

23:49.930 --> 23:52.099
Being afraid of Taylor
is just good common sense.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.934
- Anybody hungry?
- I can boot and rally.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.560
Let's do it.

23:55.644 --> 23:57.729
- You here alone?
- Yeah. You?

23:57.813 --> 23:59.022
I am.

23:59.523 --> 24:02.651
This is what I do now.
I drink alone at bars late at night.

24:02.734 --> 24:05.278
See, men can do that with no stigma attached.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.446
- Women...
- Women can vote

24:06.530 --> 24:08.281
and your vote counts the same as my vote.

24:08.365 --> 24:11.326
I'm really supposed to worry about a stigma?

24:11.827 --> 24:12.953
Oh, Don.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.454
Don, Don.

24:15.330 --> 24:16.623
Don.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.375
Are you happy with that name?

24:19.918 --> 24:22.170
Pretty happy. Never really thought about it.

24:22.254 --> 24:23.547
How'd it go in Maryland?

24:23.672 --> 24:25.173
He confirmed.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.052
Will he do it on camera?

24:29.719 --> 24:30.971
- Find out tomorrow.
- Hey, Mac.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.515
- What do you say, Chelsea?
- You here alone?

24:33.598 --> 24:35.559
- Don't stigmatize her.
- Where's the gang?

24:35.642 --> 24:37.269
Jim and Neal are on a double date,

24:37.352 --> 24:39.312
Sloan is out with a New York Giant,

24:39.396 --> 24:43.233
and Will's having
a quiet night at home with Mrs. Macbeth.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.110
HALLIE: He took some questions
from the audience

24:45.193 --> 24:46.987
and somebody asked him
if he thought the court

24:47.070 --> 24:48.488
was going to overturn the ACA.

24:48.572 --> 24:50.490
And I thought he was
gonna duck the question,

24:50.574 --> 24:52.159
but he answered for about two minutes.

24:52.242 --> 24:54.119
- What did he say?
- I swear to God, I don't know.

24:54.202 --> 24:55.787
Can I ask something?

24:55.871 --> 24:58.165
What's the fucking obsession
with Ann Romney's horse?

24:58.248 --> 25:00.667
- Reagan had a horse.
- His horse didn't dance.

25:00.750 --> 25:03.086
So fucking what, James? It's a clever horse.

25:03.170 --> 25:04.588
It's an Olympian. It's a horse.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.214
And what in this is bad?

25:06.298 --> 25:08.341
And how do you know
that Reagan's horse didn't dance?

25:08.425 --> 25:09.885
It's a reasonable question, James.

25:09.968 --> 25:11.678
How did you get into campaign reporting?

25:11.761 --> 25:14.097
I told my bosses that nobody
was covering Ron Paul

25:14.181 --> 25:15.682
and they were like, "Go do it yourself."

25:15.765 --> 25:17.559
And I was like, "Really?"
And they were like, "Really."

25:17.642 --> 25:19.352
So Ron Paul, 2012!

25:19.436 --> 25:20.729
- Is this your...
- (WHOOPING)

25:20.812 --> 25:23.023
- Okay.
- Seriously?

25:23.106 --> 25:24.900
Yeah, she's into it.

25:28.778 --> 25:30.488
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.282
- You're back again.
- Yeah.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.743
- It was Stoli and tonic?
- Yeah.

25:34.951 --> 25:36.745
- I'm Devon.
- Maggie.

25:39.998 --> 25:41.708
NINA: <i>I admire MacKenzie.</i>

25:41.791 --> 25:43.710
- And Charlie.
- So do I.

25:43.793 --> 25:45.462
I know you do.

25:45.545 --> 25:48.215
But I wonder
if it's blinding you to certain things.

25:48.298 --> 25:49.591
Like what?

25:50.300 --> 25:53.970
Well, honey, every night
you cross examine somebody.

25:54.054 --> 25:56.223
They're using your prosecutorial skills.

25:56.306 --> 25:59.559
Wait. First, they're not my puppet masters.
I'm the managing editor.

25:59.643 --> 26:01.353
But don't you always listen to MacKenzie?

26:01.436 --> 26:03.313
- Not always.
- What percent of the time?

26:03.396 --> 26:04.981
I don't know. But the idea is

26:05.065 --> 26:07.025
that we cross examine
people from time to time.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.569
- We?
- A lot of staff prep goes into those segments.

26:09.653 --> 26:11.321
But the staff's face isn't on camera.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.490
What are we talking about?

26:14.324 --> 26:16.243
Are you being sacrificed

26:16.326 --> 26:19.579
so that Mac and Charlie
can do the show they want to do?

26:19.663 --> 26:21.206
It's the show I want to do, too.

26:21.289 --> 26:22.832
- Is it?
- Yeah.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.460
Then that's that.
If it's the show you want to do,

26:25.543 --> 26:28.672
then who cares how many people like you?
I like you.

26:29.589 --> 26:33.260
It actually doesn't measure
how many people like you.

26:33.343 --> 26:34.844
It measures how much people like you.

26:34.928 --> 26:36.429
- How much?
- Yeah.

26:36.513 --> 26:39.599
- That's not something that can be measured.
- That's right.

26:39.683 --> 26:42.477
So this is really all there is to go on?

26:45.647 --> 26:48.191
Do you fully trust Jerry Dantana?

26:48.275 --> 26:50.944
- Why wouldn't I?
- No reason. I was just curious.

26:51.027 --> 26:53.613
- But there's a reason you're asking.
- There really isn't.

26:53.697 --> 26:55.949
- Can I tell you what it is?
- It was just curiosity.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.951
- It's 'cause he's not Jim.
- Please.

26:58.034 --> 27:00.704
Jerry has committed
the crime of not being Jim Harper.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.789
You know how long it took you to trust me?

27:02.872 --> 27:05.375
- How long?
- I'll let you know when it happens.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.585
I completely trust you.

27:09.004 --> 27:10.922
- Do you?
- With my life, Don.

27:11.006 --> 27:12.841
Thank you. That's nice to hear.

27:12.924 --> 27:15.468
You know, when I look at you...

27:15.552 --> 27:18.471
- Sloan's going out with a football player?
- Yeah.

27:18.555 --> 27:20.307
- Who?
- I don't remember his name.

27:20.390 --> 27:21.808
- You know what position he plays?
- No.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.310
- Offense or defense?
- I don't know.

27:23.393 --> 27:24.728
Why don't you just ask her out?

27:24.811 --> 27:26.354
After she's gone out
with a professional athlete

27:26.438 --> 27:29.399
who's 10 years younger than I am
with three percent body fat

27:29.482 --> 27:31.109

How long have you been
thinking about this guy?

27:35.488 --> 27:36.906
How am I supposed to follow that?

27:37.032 --> 27:39.784
- And, you know...
- Get it done?

27:39.868 --> 27:41.953
I can get it done.

27:42.037 --> 27:43.371

This is how every single man thinks
except for the guy out with Sloan right now.

27:54.090 --> 27:56.968
And that's why you haven't asked her out?

27:57.052 --> 28:01.222
Sometimes she subs in for Elliot
and sometimes she does a segment with us,

28:01.306 --> 28:02.849
which means sometimes I'm her boss.

28:02.932 --> 28:05.685
That stopped absolutely no one here,
including you and Maggie.

28:05.769 --> 28:08.313
That worked out phenomenally well.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.106
Nothing that happened to her is your fault.

- Okay.

- Please, no.

- I haven't.

Is it an embarrassing story about Jim?

28:39.594 --> 28:41.596
- It's not embarrassing. It's sweet.
- TAYLOR: I'd like to hear it.

I'd like to hear it as many times

You need to seem like you do.

I'll try to answer them with the same detail
and honesty you've always answered mine.

30:33.208 --> 30:35.835
What were you doing on
a <i>Sex and the City</i> tour bus to begin with?

30:35.919 --> 30:39.172
My girlfriend at the time liked the show
and I was showing an interest in her interests.

30:39.255 --> 30:42.008
And Maggie didn't know you were on the bus
when she shouted that she loved you?

30:42.091 --> 30:43.343
That's not what she shouted.

30:43.426 --> 30:44.844
- And she didn't know someone was filming it?
- No.

30:44.928 --> 30:46.846
- So it was kind of a gaffe?
- Lady, I...

30:46.930 --> 30:49.682
Life and death and you guys
can't get past "corporations are people."

30:49.766 --> 30:52.727
How fast are we supposed to get past
"Hispanics should self-deport"

30:52.810 --> 30:54.562
or "I'm not concerned with the very poor"?

30:54.646 --> 30:57.315
"There's a safety net there"
was the end of that sentence,

30:57.398 --> 30:59.609
and plainly his concern
is with the middle class.

30:59.692 --> 31:01.236
The middle class are the very poor.

31:01.319 --> 31:04.364
The better point is
we don't need clean air and water regulations.

We don't need antitrust laws.

We don't need the IRS or the Department of
Education or the Federal Reserve.

31:16.793 --> 31:18.711
AUBREY: If you listen to Ron Paul...

31:18.795 --> 31:21.047
I have. He's a batty old crank

31:21.130 --> 31:24.175
who wrote instruction manuals on how to
get away with shooting the black kid

31:24.259 --> 31:26.219
who's stealing your car. He's not Betty White.

31:26.302 --> 31:27.887
- He didn't write those letters.
- Yes, he did.

31:27.971 --> 31:30.056
And then he signed them
and then he charged money for them.

31:30.139 --> 31:32.600
So I don't give a shit
if he wants to legalize weed.

get his message out, either.

JIM: Someone should tell him
if he wants to get his message out,

31:42.318 --> 31:44.862
he should consider appearing on a network

31:44.946 --> 31:47.657
where the entire audience
isn't already voting for him

31:47.740 --> 31:49.742
and that if he's gonna be
the businessman president,

31:49.826 --> 31:53.079
he should run on his business record
instead of pretending he's never heard of it

31:53.162 --> 31:56.124
and that if faith is important to
his good works and personal narrative,

31:56.207 --> 31:57.750
he shouldn't be afraid it'll creep us out.

31:57.834 --> 31:59.252
- It's been suggested.
- And?

31:59.335 --> 32:00.753
I was fired.

32:03.214 --> 32:05.925
- I was fired tonight.
- You were fired?

32:06.009 --> 32:07.468
- Yeah.
- For suggesting...

32:07.552 --> 32:10.138
No, I suggested other things, too.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.392
I'm sorry.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.978
You were a good spokesperson for him.

you know you've broken one of God's rules

- POWs will...
- There'll be protests.

38:02.031 --> 38:03.616
Because you should.

38:03.699 --> 38:06.702
I was aiming for the fucking light tree.

38:10.373 --> 38:12.208
You didn't care
that you scored in the high 90s

38:12.291 --> 38:14.418
in trust and intelligence?

38:15.461 --> 38:18.422
- You looked like Dukakis riding in the tank.
- I know.

38:18.506 --> 38:21.092
I've done a comprehensive study
on your psychological profile.

38:21.175 --> 38:23.803
<i>"Introduction to First Year Adult Psychology."</i>

38:23.886 --> 38:26.973
I haven't read the whole thing,
but I read from page eight to...

38:27.056 --> 38:29.141
Well, I've read most of page eight.

38:29.225 --> 38:30.810
And here's what happened to you.

38:30.893 --> 38:32.645
A long, long time ago,

38:32.728 --> 38:34.522
you were doing a show
you liked with MacKenzie.

38:34.605 --> 38:36.816
Then she broke your heart.
Then you started doing a different show.

38:36.899 --> 38:39.902
A softer show.
A show built around your likeable personality.

38:39.986 --> 38:42.321
And the love you got
from the audience filled, almost,

38:42.405 --> 38:44.031
the hole in your heart.

38:44.115 --> 38:47.910
You're happy from 8:00 to 9:00
and miserable the other 23 hours.

38:47.994 --> 38:50.496
You feel more comfortable
with strangers than with friends.

38:50.579 --> 38:52.498
Then suddenly Mackie's back in town

38:52.581 --> 38:55.084
and she's making you do
the show you're supposed to be doing

38:55.167 --> 38:58.796
and she insists that you and everyone else
do the news, and you like that.

38:58.921 --> 39:00.840
But that does mean you might lose

39:00.923 --> 39:03.175
some of your invisible friends.
That sound about right?

39:03.259 --> 39:05.886
- I don't believe it really said that in the book.
- I extrapolated.

39:05.970 --> 39:08.973
You gonna tell me I'm supposed to love
myself before anyone else can love me?

39:09.056 --> 39:13.686
"Self-love, my liege,
is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting."

39:13.769 --> 39:15.688
I read page eight of Shakespeare, too.

39:15.771 --> 39:19.358
"A woman is like a tea bag. You can't tell how
strong she is until you put her in hot water."

39:19.442 --> 39:20.985
- Who said that?
- Eleanor Roosevelt.

39:21.068 --> 39:22.403
- Does that have anything to do with this?
- No.

39:22.611 --> 39:23.946
Okay.

39:25.322 --> 39:27.366
That's it? I thought I was getting chewed out.

39:27.450 --> 39:29.952
I can't say anything that would make you
feel worse than you do right now.

39:30.036 --> 39:32.121
- I like that you know that.
- You know what a Goldilocks planet is?

39:32.204 --> 39:36.292
It's a planet with the potential to support life
because of its proximity to a star.

39:36.375 --> 39:37.710
- Not too hot, not too cold.
- Right.

39:37.793 --> 39:39.587
Near liquid water,
but not made of liquid water.

39:39.670 --> 39:41.213
Enough oxygen, but not too much nitrogen.

39:41.297 --> 39:43.632
And we use something...

39:44.341 --> 39:46.052
- Transit spectroscopy.
- I think that's what it's called.

39:46.135 --> 39:48.345
To analyze the atmosphere and find planets

39:48.429 --> 39:50.014
that match the different requirements.

39:50.097 --> 39:53.100
1,300 planets were identified,
but only two confirmed.

39:53.184 --> 39:54.894
And of those two,

39:54.977 --> 39:57.438
one turned out to be something.

39:57.605 --> 39:59.023
- Radioactive.
- Yeah.

39:59.106 --> 40:01.609
So right now that leaves one planet

40:01.692 --> 40:04.028
in all of space that's perfect.

40:05.404 --> 40:07.364
You're talking about
what I think you're talking about, right?

40:07.448 --> 40:08.949
- I probably am.
- All right.

40:09.033 --> 40:10.117
Okay.

40:10.201 --> 40:11.994
How'd the date with the Giant go last night?

40:12.078 --> 40:14.246
Not that good.
He ditched me around midnight.

40:14.330 --> 40:16.916
But I did end up dancing
with Savannah Guthrie for a while.

40:16.999 --> 40:19.752
That girl can dance.
Have you seen the sheer length of her legs?

40:21.504 --> 40:23.589
I embarrassed the whole
team this morning and I'm sorry.

40:23.672 --> 40:25.174
It won't happen again.

40:26.509 --> 40:27.676
I love you, Will.

40:28.886 --> 40:30.387
Thanks, sis.

40:35.559 --> 40:36.977
JERRY: You look tired.
MAGGIE: I'm not.

40:37.061 --> 40:39.063
- When'd you get in?
- On the first shuttle.

40:39.146 --> 40:40.898
What are we going to do about the screen?

40:40.981 --> 40:42.858
Oh, it has to be on. It's a condition.

40:42.942 --> 40:45.528
I can't frame it out. There's gonna be
a piece of the game in the shot.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.113
We're gonna blur it out.

40:47.196 --> 40:49.115
Why not just move the chair?

40:49.198 --> 40:51.283
I want the hardware for gravitas.

40:51.367 --> 40:53.786
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

40:53.869 --> 40:57.039
- General.
- Let me just see what's going on here.

41:01.544 --> 41:03.045
It's a good game.

41:05.756 --> 41:07.341
- Jerry Dantana?
- Yes, sir.

41:07.424 --> 41:09.593
This is Maggie Jordan.
She's also a producer on the story.

41:09.677 --> 41:11.095
She'll be leaving before we start.

41:11.178 --> 41:12.638
No, she's a producer on the story.

41:12.721 --> 41:15.766
- She understands...
- I was told Jerry Dantana.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.184
Sir...

41:17.268 --> 41:20.521
Charlie Skinner
and MacKenzie McHale told me Jerry Dantana,

41:20.604 --> 41:23.774
and Jerry Dantana is who I had investigated,

41:23.858 --> 41:25.651
not Maggie Jordan.

41:26.235 --> 41:27.945
- Um...
- It's all right. I'll wait outside.

41:28.028 --> 41:30.698
Just check your levels once in a while.

41:31.574 --> 41:32.825
Fellas, you all set?

41:32.908 --> 41:35.327
- MAN: Yeah.
- Okay, could you wait outside?

41:36.745 --> 41:37.788
Mmm.

41:37.872 --> 41:40.040
You can sit right there, sir.

41:42.001 --> 41:44.712
You understand we're going
to ask about Operation Genoa

41:44.795 --> 41:46.839
- and that it was a classified mission?
- Yes.

41:46.922 --> 41:50.092
Okay, you're all set.

41:50.176 --> 41:52.094
I'm stepping out.

41:52.928 --> 41:54.638
JERRY: And you're going to
confirm it happened.

41:54.722 --> 41:56.140
STOMTONOVICH: It happened.

42:01.103 --> 42:03.314
JERRY: What was Operation Genoa?

42:03.397 --> 42:04.732
An extraction.

42:04.815 --> 42:08.527
Two Marines were taken by the enemy
and I won't say more than that.

42:08.611 --> 42:10.404
Who carried out the extraction?

42:10.487 --> 42:13.032
MARSOC, Marines Special
Operations Command.

42:13.115 --> 42:15.659
Were any exceptional measures
used in the operation?

42:15.743 --> 42:17.745
Exceptional measures were called for.

42:17.828 --> 42:19.330
Were they used?

42:25.544 --> 42:26.712
General?

42:27.630 --> 42:28.881
(SIGHS)

42:30.883 --> 42:33.761
- Was sarin gas used during Genoa?
- It is right.

42:33.844 --> 42:37.056
It is moral and necessary to
use any means in that situation,

42:37.139 --> 42:39.516
in the situation they were in, to use the means

42:39.600 --> 42:41.727
at your disposal to rescue captured prisoners.

42:41.810 --> 42:44.730
- Did we use sarin gas?
- If we used sarin, let me put it this way.

42:44.813 --> 42:46.857
- Sir.
- Here's how we would have used sarin.

42:46.941 --> 42:48.359
I'd like to get to the logistics in a moment,

42:48.442 --> 42:51.570
but right now I'm asking you
if we used sarin gas.

42:51.654 --> 42:54.073
If we used sarin...

42:54.156 --> 42:55.741
- General...
- Listen to me.

42:55.824 --> 43:00.246
If we used sarin, here's how we used sarin.

43:01.997 --> 43:04.583
It would have been stockpiled
in a depot in Okinawa.

43:04.667 --> 43:06.460
That's first. It was guarded...

When Mac and I showed up
at his house yesterday,

44:44.892 --> 44:46.852
he'd forgotten he'd talked to us on the phone.

44:46.935 --> 44:49.355
He thought we were selling

- MACKENZIE: Jerry...

45:00.699 --> 45:03.869
JERRY: We've got evidence of a war crime.
Just sit with that for a second.

45:04.370 --> 45:07.498
We dropped sarin gas on a village.

45:10.084 --> 45:12.044
We have a moral imperative to question

45:12.127 --> 45:14.463
the flagrant disregard
with which the president

45:14.546 --> 45:16.131
and the national security establishment

45:16.215 --> 45:18.717
treat the Constitution and international laws.

45:18.801 --> 45:20.260
What does this have to do
with the Constitution?

45:20.344 --> 45:22.721
We've killed four American citizens
without due process.

45:22.805 --> 45:24.223
And those are the ones we know about.

45:24.306 --> 45:28.143
Five times as many drone strikes
as the entire Bush presidency.

45:28.227 --> 45:32.398
Dramatically increased wiretapping,
detentions, prosecuting whistle blowers,

45:32.481 --> 45:34.900

46:10.018 --> 46:12.896
that he will stop actively campaigning

And now, thanks to the Lone Star State,

46:14.857 --> 46:17.109

"I think we are inviting

Both lance corporals.

The messages were left
for him before we got the service records.

48:10.347 --> 48:12.766
We stopped calling, but he'd been deployed.

48:12.849 --> 48:15.394

he got our messages and returned our call.

None of it was true.
