WEBVTT

00:02.104 --> 00:03.925
Yeah, maybe after the movie wraps.

00:03.926 --> 00:06.177
Keeping business and
personal separate, huh?

00:06.178 --> 00:09.222
- 'Could have fooled me.'
- I think Rainer is my son.

00:09.223 --> 00:10.806
Let me be the one to break the news.

00:10.807 --> 00:12.767
Don't you get that maybe
I don't wanna watch you

00:12.768 --> 00:14.227
live out my dream day after day.

00:14.228 --> 00:15.371
What, you're just gonna hate

00:15.372 --> 00:17.230
your best friend now, that I-I got it?

00:17.231 --> 00:19.023
Because I didn't think that you would!

00:19.024 --> 00:20.233
Did Cassie call you?

00:20.234 --> 00:21.817
Uh, she's fine, she's at her grandma's.

00:21.818 --> 00:23.194
I got the Bradbury building back.

00:23.195 --> 00:24.445
Oh, good work, Eva, keep it up

00:24.446 --> 00:26.113
and you might even get yourself a raise.

00:26.114 --> 00:28.537
I knew I picked the right gal
for the job. What did you find?

00:28.538 --> 00:30.952
Sounds like I'll finally be
able to destroy Nina Devon.

00:30.953 --> 00:32.578
- I've been fired?
- I'm sorry.

00:32.579 --> 00:34.580
But there wasn't
anything that I could do.

00:34.581 --> 00:37.208
- Okay, we're done.
- Your mother?

00:37.209 --> 00:39.710
Baby, listen, I'll tell you what
you need to know, but not now.

00:39.711 --> 00:41.170
Jordan, you've lied to me.

00:41.171 --> 00:43.047
- 'Where are you?'
- Austin.

00:43.048 --> 00:44.590
'And it's just an interview.'

00:44.591 --> 00:46.860
And, Paige, if I get
this job, I'm taking it.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.849 --> 01:35.349
There she is. Hey, Paige.

01:35.350 --> 01:37.493
It looks like you and Rainer
Devon are quite the item.

01:37.494 --> 01:39.353
Um, what? What are
you guys talking about?

01:39.354 --> 01:41.355
Uh, what?

01:41.356 --> 01:43.190
Hey, Paige, how long
you've been together?

01:43.191 --> 01:45.067
We're not, we're not together.

01:45.068 --> 01:46.736
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.282
'Are you just hooking up?'

01:51.283 --> 01:52.658
Um, no!

01:52.659 --> 01:58.659

01:59.958 --> 02:02.877
Mom, why can't the
housekeeper feed the cat?

02:02.878 --> 02:05.171
The last time I left
Mr. Freckles with Theresa

02:05.172 --> 02:06.839
he almost died, and listen

02:06.840 --> 02:09.175
'I'm only asking you to
come over here twice.'

02:09.175 --> 02:12.303
Fine, I'll swing by your
house and feed the cat.

02:12.304 --> 02:14.197
Anything else I need to know?

02:15.474 --> 02:19.727
- 'Mom. You there?'
- No, yeah. Um..

02:19.728 --> 02:22.021
Uh, the food is in the
cabinet next to the fridge.

02:22.022 --> 02:24.231
Look, I gotta go. Have a safe trip.

02:24.232 --> 02:26.251
- 'I love you.'
- I love you, too.

02:28.362 --> 02:30.488
Another congrats on
the Golden Globe nom?

02:30.489 --> 02:32.990
I might have to build an
addition if this keeps up.

02:32.991 --> 02:35.743
Actually, this one's for the
new movie. It's from my agents.

02:35.744 --> 02:37.995
The premier's tomorrow
night on the backlot, right?

02:37.996 --> 02:40.331
Yeah, they're pulling all
the stops for this one.

02:40.332 --> 02:42.458
Long way from our
Teen Choice Award days.

02:42.459 --> 02:44.752
I'm proud of you. Really.

02:44.753 --> 02:47.046
Thanks, Rain. Means a lot.

02:47.047 --> 02:48.214
You can make it to the premier, right?

02:48.215 --> 02:49.215
Wouldn't miss it.

02:49.216 --> 02:51.342
You and Tangey walking
the carpet together?

02:51.343 --> 02:53.427
Actually, I might be
flying solo on this one.

02:53.428 --> 02:55.388
- Tange still upset?
- Yeah.

02:55.389 --> 02:57.139
Not sure I blame her.

02:57.140 --> 02:59.308
I should of told her the
truth about my mom, man.

02:59.309 --> 03:02.019
Oh, come on. You were
trying to start a new life.

03:02.020 --> 03:03.688
And by the way, it worked.

03:03.689 --> 03:05.606
Look where you are now.

03:05.607 --> 03:08.109
Yeah, well, she doesn't
see it like that.

03:08.110 --> 03:09.819
She won't even return any of my calls.

03:09.820 --> 03:12.863
Tangey can be tough. Believe me, I know.

03:12.864 --> 03:16.242
But, hang in there, she cares about you.

03:16.243 --> 03:19.304
She's just angry right
now. Alright, don't give up.

03:36.012 --> 03:38.347
- Uh, hey.
- Hey.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.850
Uh, when did you get back?

03:40.851 --> 03:42.536
Uh, yesterday.

03:43.603 --> 03:46.480
Oh, but you, you didn't come home?

03:46.481 --> 03:48.649
No, I stayed the night at Adam's.

03:48.650 --> 03:50.109
It's not a big deal.

03:50.110 --> 03:53.279
Great. Glad to see you
guys hitting it off.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.364
Um, did you get any of my messages

03:55.365 --> 03:57.366
about Jake getting fired from his movie?

03:57.367 --> 04:01.036
He's in Austin, Texas now
for some job interview...

04:01.037 --> 04:02.455
Yeah, no, I know.

04:02.456 --> 04:04.558
He told me, we've been talking.

04:05.625 --> 04:07.585
Of course you have.

04:07.586 --> 04:10.504
Well, uh, I mean, what's
he gonna do about it anyway?

04:10.505 --> 04:13.090
He's not gonna, like, actually
drop out of school and...

04:13.091 --> 04:14.341
Well, they offered him the job.

04:14.342 --> 04:16.135
So, yeah, I think he's gonna take it.

04:16.136 --> 04:17.636
The-they offered him the..

04:20.307 --> 04:23.267
Um, I have to go to set, or
else I'm gonna be really late.

04:23.268 --> 04:26.103
But, Cassie, we really
should catch up and, uh..

04:26.104 --> 04:28.314
- 'Where's Rainer?'
- 'Look this way, Paige.'

04:28.315 --> 04:29.690
Does he ever bring you to class?

04:29.691 --> 04:31.275
'Bet you two do a lot of "Studying."

04:31.276 --> 04:32.735
Um..

04:32.736 --> 04:34.445
Cassie, um, I'll..

04:34.446 --> 04:36.155
I'll, I'll text you, okay?

04:38.241 --> 04:39.593
'Excuse me.'

04:47.626 --> 04:49.043
Morning.

04:49.044 --> 04:50.627
I was just heading to hair and make up.

04:50.628 --> 04:52.087
Care to join me?

04:52.088 --> 04:55.508
Uh.. Yeah, sure.

04:55.509 --> 04:56.526
You okay?

04:57.344 --> 04:59.887
Uh, no, I've suddenly got

04:59.888 --> 05:02.014
Paparazzi following my every move.

05:02.015 --> 05:05.059
TMZ picked up a photo of us
at the restaurant in Malibu.

05:05.060 --> 05:07.144
I was hoping they'd only come after me.

05:07.145 --> 05:10.105
Yeah, well, now they
think we're like a couple.

05:10.106 --> 05:12.107
They turn the story
into whatever they want.

05:12.108 --> 05:13.484
They always do.

05:13.485 --> 05:15.194
Just don't talk to them.

05:15.195 --> 05:17.297
Eventually, they get bored and go away.

05:18.198 --> 05:20.115
Did you and Cassie work things out?

05:20.116 --> 05:23.577
No. But apparently, she and
Jake talk, like, everyday.

05:23.578 --> 05:25.788
They just.. Both don't talk to me.

05:25.789 --> 05:30.501
So, I guess I've been iced
out of the three amigos.

05:30.502 --> 05:32.419
You've come to the other side.

05:32.420 --> 05:35.339
- Welcome.
- What do you mean?

05:35.340 --> 05:37.967
The same thing happened with my
friends when I started working.

05:37.968 --> 05:40.594
Sometimes the people
you had in your life

05:40.595 --> 05:43.347
before you became famous
just don't fit anymore.

05:43.348 --> 05:44.640
I'm not famous, Rainer.

05:44.641 --> 05:47.351
And yet, you have paparazzi
following your every move.

05:47.352 --> 05:48.602
It's because of you.

05:48.603 --> 05:51.188
Th-they're interested in who you date.

05:51.189 --> 05:54.608
Look, Jake and Cassie,
they're not like that, okay?

05:54.609 --> 05:58.153
We just, we've got
some stuff to work out.

05:58.154 --> 06:00.674
- I hope that's the case.
- It is.

06:06.413 --> 06:08.581
- 'Hey.'
- Hey, it's me.

06:08.582 --> 06:12.084
I was wondering if you could
talk right now, if you're free.

06:12.085 --> 06:14.108
Hey, did you know that
there's a hoard of paparazzi

06:14.109 --> 06:15.337
camped outside our apartment?

06:15.338 --> 06:17.590
And they're getting really agro, FYI.

06:17.591 --> 06:19.466
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

06:19.467 --> 06:21.302
Rainer says it'll all blow over.

06:21.303 --> 06:23.470
Just don't talk to them.

06:23.471 --> 06:26.640
Trust me, it's not me
who they wanna talk to.

06:26.641 --> 06:29.143
Hey, look, I'm off this
weekend, what do you say

06:29.144 --> 06:31.896
we watch the new episodes of
"Gilmore Girls" tomorrow night?

06:31.897 --> 06:33.880
'You know, we could have,
like, a little marathon'

06:33.881 --> 06:36.901
and order some pizza, margaritas..

06:36.902 --> 06:40.171
Um, what do you say?

06:42.866 --> 06:44.617
Okay, sure.

06:44.618 --> 06:46.785
- Really? Yeah?
- 'Yeah.'

06:46.786 --> 06:48.495
Totally, that sounds fun.

06:48.496 --> 06:50.247
Um, great. Okay. Uh..

06:52.834 --> 06:54.668
Paige, they're ready for you on set.

06:54.669 --> 06:56.795
Uh, I'll call you back, okay, Cass?

06:56.796 --> 06:58.022
Bye.

07:00.759 --> 07:03.636
- Lookin' good, Red.
- Thanks, Adam.

07:03.637 --> 07:05.554
Pretty great about Jake's new gig, huh?

07:05.555 --> 07:06.722
Crazy fast.

07:06.723 --> 07:08.390
I mean, Cass asked me one day

07:08.391 --> 07:11.560
and my buddy Zach hooks it up the next.

07:11.561 --> 07:14.480
Uh, wait, uh, Cass asked you?

07:14.481 --> 07:18.567
Cass told me that Jake needed
a change of scenery, like ASAP.

07:18.568 --> 07:19.818
- Did she?
- 'Yeah.'

07:19.819 --> 07:21.612
'Working for a legend like Linklater'

07:21.613 --> 07:23.280
is an amazing opportunity.

07:23.281 --> 07:25.157
Plus, Austin is so fun.

07:25.158 --> 07:27.284
If Jake gets started in that crew

07:27.285 --> 07:29.596
he might never come back to LA.

07:32.374 --> 07:35.059
No, he might not.

07:42.401 --> 07:45.987
- Hey, Tange.
- Hey.

07:45.988 --> 07:49.532
I gotta go to hair and make
up. So, what do you want?

07:49.533 --> 07:51.259
A chance to explain.

07:54.788 --> 07:57.123
Do you remember our
first premiere together?

07:57.124 --> 07:58.416
Jordan, come on.

07:58.417 --> 08:00.126
We weren't even invited

08:00.127 --> 08:02.020
but Rainer got us in, remember?

08:03.255 --> 08:06.299
Yeah. I mean, you guys were
already on "Backsplash."

08:06.300 --> 08:07.842
I didn't even have an album out yet.

08:07.843 --> 08:10.344
And you were fifteen, and
we were both so into you.

08:10.345 --> 08:13.681
- You were?
- Come on, you know it.

08:13.682 --> 08:15.784
It started for me way back then.

08:17.311 --> 08:19.353
My premiere is tomorrow night.

08:19.354 --> 08:21.647
Walk the carpet with me.

08:21.648 --> 08:23.750
Let me show you how
much I want us to work.

08:25.152 --> 08:28.088
- Jordan..
- Just say, "Yes."

08:30.907 --> 08:34.368
I can't. I can't, Jordan. I'm sorry.

08:34.369 --> 08:36.804
I can't be with someone I don't trust.

08:51.386 --> 08:54.055
Paige. Hi.

08:54.056 --> 08:57.058
Have you heard from Jake?
I've been kind of worried.

08:57.059 --> 08:58.309
Now you're worried?

08:58.310 --> 09:00.353
Do you even know where he is right now?

09:00.354 --> 09:02.355
Austin, Texas.

09:02.356 --> 09:04.148
He's taking a job there,
he's quitting school

09:04.149 --> 09:07.860
and he's leaving in LA,
all because of... you.

09:07.861 --> 09:09.195
That's not fair.

09:09.196 --> 09:10.696
You have no idea what happened.

09:10.697 --> 09:12.615
I fought for Jake to stay on his movie.

09:12.616 --> 09:14.718
'Rehearsal's up, let's go!'

09:17.329 --> 09:19.806
- It's a fat suit.
- I didn't say anything.

09:22.376 --> 09:24.811
- Hey, Jordan.
- Hey.

09:26.338 --> 09:28.255
'Action!'

09:28.256 --> 09:29.674
Our flight leaves in a few hours.

09:29.675 --> 09:31.217
I know. I just..

09:31.218 --> 09:33.511
I can't help feeling like
I'm forgetting something.

09:33.512 --> 09:35.238
Just focus on us.

09:36.473 --> 09:38.950
A week in Hawaii, feet in the sand.

09:43.563 --> 09:45.147
I know.

09:45.148 --> 09:47.858
I can't wait, but, uh..

09:47.859 --> 09:51.237
What am I forgetting? Maggie!

09:51.238 --> 09:53.421
Maggie! I-I didn't tell
Maggie we're gonna pick her up.

09:53.422 --> 09:57.076
Where is my phone?

09:57.077 --> 09:58.452
I thought I'd put it..

09:58.453 --> 10:02.873
You were my first love, and
I want you to be my last.

10:02.874 --> 10:05.977
August Roch, will you do
me the honor of marrying me?

10:07.337 --> 10:09.481
Hey, we're ready to go.

10:12.843 --> 10:14.301
I picked up Maggie.

10:14.302 --> 10:16.446
We're parked out front.

10:18.807 --> 10:20.909
'That's a cut on rehearsal!'

10:25.230 --> 10:27.815
Hey, Wyatt, I have a
question about the scene.

10:27.816 --> 10:29.108
Yeah, sure. What's up?

10:29.109 --> 10:31.026
Why can't August just give

10:31.027 --> 10:32.570
Ed an answer when he asks?

10:32.571 --> 10:34.822
I mean, in the book she says
she has to think about it

10:34.823 --> 10:37.283
so why can't I just
say something like that?

10:37.284 --> 10:40.911
Look, the point of the movie
is that she can't make a choice.

10:40.912 --> 10:43.375
Remember, the scene happens in
the very beginning of the film.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.375
You're with Ed, he loves you,
he's just proposed to you.

10:46.376 --> 10:48.794
You all get on a plane, and it crashes.

10:48.795 --> 10:50.880
You and Noah are thrown back in time.

10:50.881 --> 10:52.673
Your journey through
the course of this film

10:52.674 --> 10:54.717
is to return to the present.

10:54.718 --> 10:57.261
And along the way..

10:57.262 --> 10:58.554
...you fall in love.

10:58.555 --> 10:59.972
Uh, right, but...

10:59.973 --> 11:02.558
So, the proposal hangs
over the entire movie.

11:02.559 --> 11:05.478
It informs her inevitable
love story with Noah

11:05.479 --> 11:07.605
and whether or not you
stay in time with him

11:07.606 --> 11:10.524
or return to the present to be with Ed.

11:10.525 --> 11:13.652
This is my mother. Sorry. Hey, mom.

11:13.653 --> 11:16.322
'Alright. Listen up, gang! Listen up!'

11:16.323 --> 11:19.575
Listen up. One of our
own, hit the big time.

11:19.576 --> 11:20.951
Not only did he land his first

11:20.952 --> 11:22.870
Golden Globe nomination this week

11:22.871 --> 11:25.331
but his new movie, a Gold
Brothers Select division

11:25.332 --> 11:26.415
I might add.

11:26.416 --> 11:29.794
Opens around the country tomorrow.

11:29.795 --> 11:32.087
Way to go, huh? Look at
that smile right there.

11:32.088 --> 11:33.547
And the entire cast..

11:33.548 --> 11:35.591
'Everybody is gonna walk the red carpet'

11:35.592 --> 11:37.301
'in support of our boy tomorrow.'

11:37.302 --> 11:39.595
'Alright, and let this
be, let this be the start'

11:39.596 --> 11:43.390
of some great things for our franchise.

11:43.391 --> 11:46.018
Congratulations. Jordan!

12:02.410 --> 12:04.161
What are you doing?

12:04.162 --> 12:06.622
Uh, helping Jake.

12:06.623 --> 12:09.542
He ask me to help him, he's
flying back in a few days

12:09.543 --> 12:11.043
and then he only has a day before

12:11.044 --> 12:13.379
he needs to drive back to Austin.

12:13.380 --> 12:15.548
And whose fault is that?

12:15.549 --> 12:17.550
- Excuse me?
- 'I talked to Adam.'

12:17.551 --> 12:19.593
I-I know this whole
thing was your idea.

12:19.594 --> 12:22.530
- So, what?
- "So, what?"

12:23.348 --> 12:25.182
It-it's Texas, Cassie.

12:25.183 --> 12:27.643
What if he loves it and he stays?

12:27.644 --> 12:29.687
Why-why would you do this?

12:29.688 --> 12:32.565
Because it's a great opportunity, Paige.

12:32.566 --> 12:34.789
When Adam mentioned it, I
knew that Jake would go for it

12:34.790 --> 12:36.610
because it's exactly
what he needs right now.

12:36.611 --> 12:38.571
Yeah, maybe after he felt defeated

12:38.572 --> 12:39.435
because he got fired.

12:39.436 --> 12:41.407
But, come on, long term.

12:41.408 --> 12:42.992
You remember our freshman year

12:42.993 --> 12:44.994
when he wrote his first stage play

12:44.995 --> 12:46.537
and that creative writing class

12:46.538 --> 12:48.664
completely tore it
apart in front of him?

12:48.665 --> 12:50.583
He wanted to leave, and
he wanted to go home.

12:50.584 --> 12:51.959
And what did we do?

12:51.960 --> 12:55.838
We stayed there all night,
talking him out of it.

12:55.839 --> 12:57.798
That's what you should have done.

12:57.799 --> 12:59.508
We're not freshman anymore!

12:59.509 --> 13:02.469
- This is different.
- Yeah, maybe, but..

13:02.470 --> 13:06.348
Your job as a best friend was
not to convince him to leave.

13:06.349 --> 13:08.225
Jake didn't get what he wanted here.

13:08.226 --> 13:10.561
Not with school, not with the script

13:10.562 --> 13:12.897
and not with you.

13:12.898 --> 13:15.816
Don't you get that it's
killing him to stay.

13:15.817 --> 13:18.652
And I can't believe you're so selfish

13:18.653 --> 13:20.505
you can't even see that.

13:37.254 --> 13:38.254
_

13:43.939 --> 13:47.029
_

13:49.477 --> 13:50.309
_

13:52.557 --> 13:57.687
_

13:59.597 --> 14:01.591
_

14:07.075 --> 14:09.368
So you two still haven't made up?

14:09.369 --> 14:11.996
Well, we kind of did, and
then she found out from you

14:11.997 --> 14:14.081
that I hooked Jacob with
that film job in Austin.

14:14.082 --> 14:17.376
- Sorry.
- Don't be, it's not your fault.

14:17.377 --> 14:21.630
I just need to vent,
so let me vent, okay?

14:21.631 --> 14:23.966
- Vent away.
- She's just so controlling.

14:23.967 --> 14:27.094
I mean, as if I have that
kind of mind power over Jake.

14:27.095 --> 14:29.847
'She doesn't even realize
that everything has changed.'

14:29.848 --> 14:32.099
Like, her life is totally different.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.685
And she expects me and
Jake to be exactly the same.

14:34.686 --> 14:36.937
Like, all of this
just doesn't affect us.

14:36.938 --> 14:38.939
It's so unfair.

14:38.940 --> 14:42.460
- We done venting?
- Hold on. It's..

14:43.695 --> 14:45.589
Yeah, okay, I'm done venting.

14:46.783 --> 14:48.246
You know what you need to do, right?

14:48.247 --> 14:50.034
Yeah, I know.

14:50.035 --> 14:51.761
I will talk to her.

14:52.913 --> 14:56.141
- Thanks, Adam.
- You're welcome.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.311
Hey, when's your roommate coming out?

15:02.312 --> 15:03.589
- Is she dating Rainer?
- Uh..

15:03.590 --> 15:05.653
- Get your roommate out.
- Girl, you know, you know.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.009
'Tell us. Tell us!'

15:07.010 --> 15:08.870
- How long you've been going on?
- 'Come on.'

15:10.055 --> 15:12.365
So, I think this is the one, right?

15:13.975 --> 15:16.268
Uh, Cass, hi, um..

15:16.269 --> 15:18.813
It's okay that they're here, right?

15:18.814 --> 15:20.373
It's your apartment, too.

15:21.358 --> 15:22.542
Um..

15:23.485 --> 15:25.212
Sorry. Excuse me for one second.

15:27.364 --> 15:29.049
'Cass, hey.'

15:30.242 --> 15:31.575
Look, I-I'm..

15:31.576 --> 15:33.619
I'm really sorry about all this.

15:33.620 --> 15:35.246
- What's going on?
- Um..

15:35.247 --> 15:36.830
They're fitting the whole "Locked" cast

15:36.831 --> 15:38.999
for Jordan's movie
premiere tomorrow night.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.126
Tomorrow night?

15:40.127 --> 15:42.854
So, we're not doing the
"Gilmore Girls" marathon?

15:43.866 --> 15:45.506
Yeah, I-I wanted to
talk to you about that

15:45.507 --> 15:46.924
because y-you see, they..

15:46.925 --> 15:48.548
They threw this on
us, super last minute.

15:48.549 --> 15:50.553
And they're really not
even giving us a choice.

15:50.554 --> 15:53.139
So, I was wondering if maybe

15:53.140 --> 15:55.450
there's another night we could do it.

15:58.145 --> 16:00.062
It's cool, Paige.

16:00.063 --> 16:03.941
Hey, Cass, I really am sorry.

16:03.942 --> 16:05.359
It's fine.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.878
Have fun.

16:15.412 --> 16:17.204
'This is your moment, Jordan.'

16:17.205 --> 16:19.165
So you wanna pursue that
Liam Hemsworth project?

16:19.166 --> 16:21.041
- Great double blow.
- Yeah, of course.

16:21.042 --> 16:23.252
- I'm a big fan of his.
- Well, he's a big fan of yours.

16:23.253 --> 16:25.636
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg
also want to sit down with you.

16:25.637 --> 16:28.132
They've got a comedy heist
film that you'd be perfect for.

16:28.133 --> 16:30.009
Oh, that's great. Let's do it.

16:30.010 --> 16:31.593
We'll see you at your premiere tonight.

16:31.594 --> 16:32.654
Wear something nice.

16:35.265 --> 16:36.741
Hey, Tange.

16:39.186 --> 16:40.936
Hey.

16:40.937 --> 16:43.230
- Power lunch?
- You could say that.

16:43.231 --> 16:45.149
Everyone is very interested

16:45.150 --> 16:46.533
all of a sudden in what I do next.

16:46.534 --> 16:49.653
Well, I mean, the Golden
Globe nomination is huge.

16:49.654 --> 16:51.757
Yeah, you shouldn't, you
know, take that for granted.

16:51.758 --> 16:53.110
Oh, I'm not.

16:54.034 --> 16:55.302
Well, I'll see you around.

16:56.411 --> 16:58.179
Hey, hey, Tange.

16:59.122 --> 17:01.415
I thought you, of all
people, would understand this.

17:01.416 --> 17:02.958
Excuse me?

17:02.959 --> 17:05.877
You talk all the time about
having a controlling mother.

17:05.878 --> 17:09.089
Why you think I was running
cons and stealing at 14?

17:09.089 --> 17:10.549
Because I wanted to?

17:10.550 --> 17:11.893
So, the first chance I got to put

17:11.894 --> 17:13.579
the past behind me, I took it.

17:14.138 --> 17:15.602
See, I thought if you knew the truth

17:15.603 --> 17:17.329
you wouldn't want to be with me.

17:18.308 --> 17:20.517
- Looks like maybe I was right.
- Oh, no.

17:20.518 --> 17:23.038
I gotta go, I have a scene to shoot.

17:23.730 --> 17:25.205
I'll see you around.

17:37.118 --> 17:38.536
- Hey, what?
- You wanted to see us?

17:38.537 --> 17:40.329
Oh, yeah, that-that's gonna look great.

17:40.330 --> 17:42.206
- What?
- Steadicam shot.

17:42.207 --> 17:43.374
Light streaming through.

17:43.375 --> 17:45.167
The big sex scene shoots tomorrow.

17:45.168 --> 17:46.791
I just wanted you
guys to run through it.

17:46.792 --> 17:48.921
Get the choreography
down so it looks natural.

17:48.922 --> 17:50.172
Choreography?

17:50.173 --> 17:51.715
Well, I don't wanna dictate to you two

17:51.716 --> 17:53.884
when to kiss, when to
take off your clothes.

17:53.885 --> 17:55.970
So, you can figure that out yourselves

17:55.971 --> 17:57.680
so it looks good on film.

17:57.681 --> 18:01.600
I'm sorry, h-how much exactly
are we planning to show?

18:01.601 --> 18:03.227
Don't worry, we'll capture it all.

18:03.228 --> 18:05.312
We can cut around anything,
we're not allowed to see.

18:05.313 --> 18:07.898
We'll have a closed set, it'll be okay.

18:07.899 --> 18:10.276
Okay, I'll give you guys
privacy to block it out

18:10.277 --> 18:12.504
and we'll see what
you guys come up with.

18:15.740 --> 18:18.409
Okay, so, uh..

18:18.410 --> 18:19.785
Ho-how do we do this

18:19.786 --> 18:22.496
this whole, like, "Act natural" thing?

18:22.497 --> 18:25.374
I always wondered how actors did it.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.334
We think about what
Noah and August would do

18:27.335 --> 18:28.711
what they're feeling.

18:28.712 --> 18:31.380
You forget about
everything beyond the lights

18:31.381 --> 18:33.215
and all you have is, right now.

18:33.216 --> 18:34.693
Right.

18:37.053 --> 18:39.388
Okay, so, you remember
where Noah and August

18:39.389 --> 18:40.932
are at this point of the movie, right?

18:40.933 --> 18:43.225
They're holding off being together

18:43.226 --> 18:46.854
but their attraction is growing and...

18:46.855 --> 18:48.689
New Year's Eve.

18:48.690 --> 18:50.357
They danced all night

18:50.358 --> 18:54.361
and then the clock strikes
midnight, and they kiss.

18:54.362 --> 18:56.196
'And after that, they can't
keep their hands off each other'

18:56.197 --> 18:58.198
they're-they're making
out at the dance hall

18:58.199 --> 18:59.742
in the taxi on the way over

18:59.743 --> 19:02.745
up the stairs, down the hall

19:02.746 --> 19:05.289
to right here.

19:05.290 --> 19:09.251
S-should I, uh, block this with you?

19:09.252 --> 19:11.354
Yeah, come here.

19:13.673 --> 19:14.941
Come here.

19:16.217 --> 19:18.761
Um, so, they're kissing.

19:18.762 --> 19:22.431
As he, um, kicks the door shut

19:22.432 --> 19:24.224
I-I feel like..

19:24.225 --> 19:27.746
...Noah would maybe
push her into the wall.

19:31.483 --> 19:34.794
Um, and maybe..

19:37.197 --> 19:41.092
...August would pull him closer to her?

19:44.037 --> 19:46.181
And then he'd kiss your neck.

19:47.666 --> 19:51.394
As she takes your jacket off.

19:53.713 --> 19:56.423
And I with my hand up your skirt

19:56.424 --> 20:00.945
as I kiss... your ear.

20:03.264 --> 20:05.283
And then, lift you to the bed.

20:08.228 --> 20:10.270
'And I would pull you on top of me.'

20:10.271 --> 20:14.400
Kiss your face and your neck.

20:14.401 --> 20:19.238
I would kiss down the
length of your body..

20:19.239 --> 20:21.573
...down your chest,
through your stomach.

20:21.574 --> 20:26.095
And then I would pull you up..

20:27.914 --> 20:29.599
...push you over..

20:30.625 --> 20:32.727
...and get on top of you.

20:43.430 --> 20:46.390
'Alright, guys, let's get
those set pieces moved in.'

20:46.391 --> 20:50.453
- Ah, something... like that.
- Yeah, something like that.

21:01.204 --> 21:02.872
There she is! Come on in here, girl.

21:02.873 --> 21:04.624
There's somebody I want you to meet.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.417
Ry Coolidge, it's nice to meet you.

21:06.418 --> 21:08.002
- I'm a big fan.
- H-hi.

21:08.003 --> 21:09.670
Ry is a songwriter.

21:09.671 --> 21:11.631
He was nominated for
three Grammys last year

21:11.632 --> 21:13.716
includin' country album of the year.

21:13.717 --> 21:15.509
Wow, that's really impressive.

21:15.510 --> 21:17.219
I could say the same thing about you.

21:17.220 --> 21:19.347
Y'all killed it on Conan
with that new track of yours.

21:19.348 --> 21:21.641
- I really dug it.
- Thank you, thank you.

21:21.642 --> 21:23.643
Listen, I'm on a red-eye
back to Nashville tonight

21:23.644 --> 21:25.707
but maybe when you get some
time, we can kick around

21:25.708 --> 21:27.308
some ideas about the rest of your album?

21:27.332 --> 21:29.649
- Yeah.
- That would be fantastic.

21:29.650 --> 21:31.233
- Ha ha.
- Alright, y'all be good.

21:31.234 --> 21:33.152
- Ya hear?
- Yeah.

21:33.153 --> 21:34.880
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

21:37.699 --> 21:39.450
Okay, what is happening right now?

21:39.451 --> 21:41.661
Look, I know I haven't
always been in support

21:41.662 --> 21:43.829
of this whole country thing..

21:43.830 --> 21:45.247
...but we're in this together.

21:45.248 --> 21:46.831
And I'm gonna do everything in my power

21:46.832 --> 21:48.709
to make the album a success.

21:48.710 --> 21:50.795
- Really?
- Really.

21:50.796 --> 21:53.965
And Ry is the most sought after
writer in Nashville right now.

21:53.966 --> 21:56.592
And it doesn't hurt
that he's good-lookin'.

21:56.593 --> 21:58.427
And single.

21:58.428 --> 21:59.762
- Ma.
- What?

21:59.763 --> 22:01.363
I mean, now that you're done with Jordan

22:01.387 --> 22:02.556
you're available, right?

22:02.557 --> 22:05.226
I don't know. Maybe I'm
not done with Jordan.

22:06.395 --> 22:07.829
Tangey..

22:09.856 --> 22:10.898
Come, come over here.

22:10.899 --> 22:12.316
Sit-sit down for a minute.

22:12.317 --> 22:14.252
Ahh... here we go.

22:15.612 --> 22:18.548
I know it seems like
I'm always hatin' on him

22:19.741 --> 22:21.242
but there's a good reason.

22:21.243 --> 22:23.786
I know, "Jordan has a
past." "Jordan is a player."

22:23.787 --> 22:27.039
But... what you don't know
is the whole truth, Tangey.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.976
Okay, so then tell me
what're you talking about?

22:32.879 --> 22:34.839
Jordan killed a man..

22:34.840 --> 22:36.257
...in cold blood.

22:36.258 --> 22:37.484
What?

22:38.802 --> 22:41.637
No. No, ma, it's not, it's true.

22:41.638 --> 22:45.391
It's true... the fact is, he'd
be in jail for life right now

22:45.392 --> 22:47.518
if his mother hadn't taken the rap.

22:47.519 --> 22:50.271
And it was Nina who
wrote his fake life story

22:50.272 --> 22:52.690
gave him a new name,
and made him a star.

22:52.691 --> 22:54.066
No, ma, I can't believe that.

22:54.067 --> 22:57.778
You don't have to believe
me. Ask him yourself.

22:57.779 --> 22:59.321
Maybe now you'll understand

22:59.322 --> 23:02.575
why I've been so tough
on you about this.

23:02.576 --> 23:06.620
I'm sorry, but I'm the one
who really cares about you.

23:15.756 --> 23:18.400
- Hi.
- Hi, hey, oh..

23:19.468 --> 23:21.594
- You wrapped?
- Uh... yeah.

23:21.595 --> 23:22.636
- Are you?
- No.

23:22.637 --> 23:24.020
We still have to mop up some stunt

23:24.021 --> 23:25.473
pieces in the last fight scene.

23:25.474 --> 23:27.850
- Boo.
- Yeah, where you headed?

23:27.851 --> 23:29.143
Home, I was gonna go try

23:29.144 --> 23:30.728
and work things out with Cassie.

23:30.729 --> 23:34.374
- Oh, good luck.
- Thanks.

23:36.276 --> 23:37.961
Bye.

23:39.071 --> 23:41.489
Paige..

23:41.490 --> 23:43.532
I promise you, this
new life you're starting

23:43.533 --> 23:45.659
is gonna be amazing.

23:45.660 --> 23:47.328
It's just.. Where you're headed?

23:47.329 --> 23:48.954
You can't take them with you.

23:48.955 --> 23:50.414
It doesn't work that way.

23:50.415 --> 23:53.018
- I really hope you're wrong.
- Me too.

24:05.764 --> 24:07.807
Hey, um, I let myself in.

24:07.808 --> 24:10.559
- Hmm, what's wrong?
- It's about Jordan.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.895
Look, I just found out
something horrible about him.

24:12.896 --> 24:14.396
Something that I can't even believe.

24:14.397 --> 24:16.774
Tange, you can't listen to
every stupid thing you hear...

24:16.775 --> 24:19.652
No, no, no, Rain. Rain, this is serious.

24:19.653 --> 24:20.945
- Okay.
- Look..

24:20.946 --> 24:22.780
I know he's your best
friend and everything.

24:22.781 --> 24:25.699
But please, don't try to hide
anything from me right now!

24:25.700 --> 24:26.909
Don't try to lie!

24:26.910 --> 24:28.845
I need the truth. Straight up.

24:30.705 --> 24:32.682
Did Jordan kill someone?

24:37.462 --> 24:39.380
Eh... yes.

24:40.465 --> 24:41.757
- Oh, my God!
- But..

24:41.758 --> 24:43.175
But it's not as simple as that.

24:43.176 --> 24:44.927
What? What do you mean?

24:44.928 --> 24:46.571
He either did, or he didn't..

24:48.056 --> 24:49.932
He was fourteen.

24:49.933 --> 24:51.392
It was his mother's boyfriend.

24:51.393 --> 24:53.853
He was beating her,
he was beating Jordan.

24:53.854 --> 24:55.855
This guy was really bad news, Tangey.

24:55.856 --> 24:57.857
The night that it happened..

24:57.858 --> 24:59.650
...he would've killed her..

24:59.651 --> 25:01.861
...and probably Jordan, too.

25:01.862 --> 25:03.645
Jordan did the only
thing he could have done.

25:03.646 --> 25:05.990
He saved his mother's life that night.

25:05.991 --> 25:08.200
And then, your mom saved him

25:08.201 --> 25:09.994
with the fake history she created?

25:11.329 --> 25:12.769
You've known my mom for a long time.

25:12.770 --> 25:14.897
Do you really think she
would've stepped up for Jordan

25:14.898 --> 25:17.585
and put her entire
reputation on the line..

25:17.586 --> 25:19.646
...if it happened any other way?

25:25.343 --> 25:26.677
'The caller you're trying'

25:26.678 --> 25:27.970
'to reach is unavailable.'

25:27.971 --> 25:29.722
'Please leave a message after the beep.'

25:29.723 --> 25:32.224
Hi, Jake. It's Paige.

25:32.225 --> 25:35.811
Obviously, um.. Can
you call me back please?

25:35.812 --> 25:37.289
I..

25:39.566 --> 25:40.900
Really?

25:40.901 --> 25:43.944
I mean, is this how
it's gonna go down then?

25:43.945 --> 25:46.381
You're... you're just gonna walk away?

25:49.284 --> 25:51.202
So, what? We-we-we're not gonna..

25:51.203 --> 25:54.205
We're never gonna make pancakes
together again in the morning?

25:54.206 --> 25:56.790
We're never gonna... stay up all night

25:56.791 --> 25:58.626
and watch the worst movies, and, and...

25:58.627 --> 26:02.838
we're never gonna... get
drunk all night at Los Amigos?

26:02.839 --> 26:04.840
Huh? Is that it?

26:04.841 --> 26:07.319
Well, you know what?
I-I can't accept that.

26:09.262 --> 26:12.532
Okay, and I, and I didn't even
get a chance to say goodbye.

26:35.288 --> 26:36.914
'Cut!'

26:36.915 --> 26:38.832
'Nice work! New deal, people.'

26:38.833 --> 26:40.935
- That was great, Dusty!
- Thanks, buddy.

26:42.003 --> 26:43.754
Way to go, Rain.

26:43.755 --> 26:45.498
You threw those punches
to camera perfectly.

26:45.499 --> 26:47.258
Oh, I told you I got this down.

26:47.259 --> 26:49.218
- My dad was a stuntman.
- Really?

26:49.219 --> 26:50.552
I thought he died in Iraq.

26:50.553 --> 26:52.096
I mean, that's what I always heard.

26:52.097 --> 26:54.348
That's the story my mom
floated for the public

26:54.349 --> 26:55.516
to protect our privacy.

26:55.517 --> 26:57.935
Oh! I get it.

26:57.936 --> 26:59.548
Well, I know just about
everyone in the guild.

26:59.549 --> 27:01.146
- Who was your dad?
- Steve Channing.

27:01.147 --> 27:02.356
They were together on location

27:02.357 --> 27:04.149
in Morocco, but I never met him.

27:04.150 --> 27:05.901
He died when I was really little.

27:05.902 --> 27:08.028
Wait, Steve Channing

27:08.029 --> 27:10.012
who died during the filming
of "Prophecy of Sins?"

27:10.013 --> 27:12.449
Yeah, eh, he-he, you knew him?

27:12.450 --> 27:15.828
Ohh, you could say that.

27:15.829 --> 27:17.180
It's just..

27:19.499 --> 27:21.684
I'm pretty sure he wasn't your dad.

27:23.169 --> 27:25.129
- What do you mean?
- Ohh..

27:25.130 --> 27:27.113
Look, things were a little
bit different back then

27:27.114 --> 27:28.966
so nobody really knows this, but..

27:31.428 --> 27:33.137
...Steve was gay.

27:33.138 --> 27:35.681
- No, you got the wrong guy.
- Rainer.

27:35.682 --> 27:36.932
He was my partner.

27:36.933 --> 27:40.310
We were together for over 15 years.

27:40.311 --> 27:43.832
He didn't sleep with women, trust me.

27:45.608 --> 27:46.900
I'm sorry. Really.

27:46.901 --> 27:49.361
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.

27:49.362 --> 27:51.506
You should probably
just talk to your mom.

28:41.247 --> 28:42.622
'So, how did it go?'

28:42.623 --> 28:43.665
It didn't go at all.

28:43.666 --> 28:45.250
I mean, when I got home

28:45.251 --> 28:48.044
it was like the backstage
of a fashion show.

28:48.045 --> 28:50.297
And we didn't get a chance to talk.

28:50.298 --> 28:52.340
It's a part of her job now.

28:52.341 --> 28:54.968
You know, it comes with the territory.

28:54.969 --> 28:56.970
You'll find the time.

28:56.971 --> 28:58.179
I know, it's just..

28:58.180 --> 29:00.807
...when I think back
on how it used to be

29:00.808 --> 29:02.311
you know, the three of us would spend

29:02.312 --> 29:03.393
all of our time together.

29:03.394 --> 29:05.562
We were inseparable,
we'd stay up all night

29:05.563 --> 29:06.730
talking about nothing.

29:06.731 --> 29:10.108
And now I feel like
every time I turn around

29:10.109 --> 29:12.336
there's something new
getting in the way.

29:14.822 --> 29:16.573
You know, something
similar happened to me

29:16.574 --> 29:17.824
and a buddy of mine.

29:17.825 --> 29:20.201
- Really?
- After Northwestern.

29:20.202 --> 29:22.162
We were both doing improv in Chicago

29:22.163 --> 29:25.290
and my buddy Patrick, got scouted

29:25.291 --> 29:27.500
by a guy at Second City.

29:27.501 --> 29:30.086
Next thing we know, SNL comes knocking

29:30.087 --> 29:32.172
and suddenly, the guy is famous.

29:32.173 --> 29:34.257
Wait, your friend is Patrick Newton?

29:34.258 --> 29:35.550
Yeah.

29:35.551 --> 29:38.261
And once he made it,
it was like, he changed.

29:38.262 --> 29:40.847
I mean, I started hating
it when he'd complain

29:40.848 --> 29:43.391
about all the interviews he had to do

29:43.392 --> 29:46.394
or how little time he had for himself.

29:46.395 --> 29:49.564
But what really changed was..

29:49.565 --> 29:52.359
...we were just a couple
of guys trying to break in.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.361
And then, once he made it, it was like..

29:54.362 --> 29:55.820
...I was just a "Hanger on."

29:55.821 --> 29:58.281
Like, I was just part of his entourage.

29:58.282 --> 29:59.282
Yup.

29:59.283 --> 30:00.801
And I didn't wanna be that guy.

30:01.702 --> 30:03.262
So I moved out here.

30:03.871 --> 30:06.623
So, what about now?

30:06.624 --> 30:08.166
Are you guys still friends?

30:08.167 --> 30:10.335
Yeah, actually.

30:10.336 --> 30:11.878
That's the thing.

30:11.879 --> 30:14.714
I think me moving out
here was the best thing

30:14.715 --> 30:16.174
for the both of us in the end.

30:25.571 --> 30:26.851
- There you are...
- Don't start.

30:26.852 --> 30:28.269
I just got off a five-hour flight

30:28.270 --> 30:29.521
I've a terrible migraine

30:29.522 --> 30:31.189
and I have a bond company
meeting in an hour.

30:31.190 --> 30:32.510
- But Rainer...
- Rainer can wait.

30:32.511 --> 30:33.614
I will call him back later.

30:33.615 --> 30:35.772
No, Rainer is here.

30:41.450 --> 30:42.784
Hey, honey.

30:42.785 --> 30:45.804
- 'Is everything okay?'
- Can you shut the door, please?

30:50.418 --> 30:52.228
What's wrong?

30:52.545 --> 30:54.522
Ah..

30:55.464 --> 30:56.815
Alan Mills.

30:57.925 --> 30:59.759
Oh, my God.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.219
I go away for only two days

31:01.220 --> 31:03.513
and he's already pissed
off the star of my movie.

31:03.514 --> 31:06.450
Rain, don't worry.
Whatever it is, I'll fix it.

31:08.436 --> 31:10.538
I don't think you're
gonna be able to fix this.

31:12.440 --> 31:16.317
Today, I found out that the man
I thought was my dad all my life

31:16.318 --> 31:18.862
was in a committed
relationship with another man.

31:18.863 --> 31:20.589
So, that was a lot to take in.

31:21.574 --> 31:23.241
But then it got me thinking.

31:23.242 --> 31:25.702
Alan's suddenly shown a lot
of interest in me lately.

31:25.703 --> 31:28.371
Asking all kinds of
questions about my childhood.

31:28.372 --> 31:29.622
What my life is like.

31:29.623 --> 31:32.208
Hanging around on set
for no apparent reason.

31:32.209 --> 31:34.544
And then it hit me, Alan surfs.

31:34.545 --> 31:36.504
He gets motion sickness on planes.

31:36.505 --> 31:39.132
His dad had a drinking
problem, just like he did

31:39.133 --> 31:41.718
and just like me.

31:47.892 --> 31:50.560
It's him, isn't it?

31:50.561 --> 31:51.895
He's my father.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.653
Yes.

32:05.326 --> 32:08.536
So you robbed me of havin' a father.

32:08.537 --> 32:11.414
You lied to me everyday for 23 years.

32:11.415 --> 32:14.834
When you tucked me
in when I was little..

32:14.835 --> 32:16.544
When you dropped me off at school

32:16.545 --> 32:18.463
when I played baseball all those years.

32:18.464 --> 32:21.382
At my games alone thinking
I didn't have a dad.

32:21.383 --> 32:22.509
You lied.

32:22.510 --> 32:24.385
You stole that part
of my childhood from me

32:24.386 --> 32:25.762
and I'll never get it back.

32:25.763 --> 32:28.389
Honey, I can explain.

32:28.390 --> 32:29.891
I know you can't see it right now

32:29.892 --> 32:33.520
but Alan would have
been a horrible father.

32:33.521 --> 32:36.481
And you're just gonna
have to believe me on that.

32:36.482 --> 32:39.400
It's a decision I did not make lightly.

32:39.401 --> 32:41.611
No.

32:41.612 --> 32:45.448
No, but you, you did it anyway.

32:45.449 --> 32:48.952
Didn't you? Because that's
the control freak in you.

32:48.953 --> 32:50.328
That's who you are.

32:50.329 --> 32:54.415
I have never in my life felt so alone.

32:54.416 --> 32:58.545
So unloved, so... betrayed.

32:58.546 --> 33:00.064
Don't say that.

33:01.257 --> 33:03.651
You have to know that I love you.

33:04.593 --> 33:06.445
You are my only son.

33:09.223 --> 33:10.991
You're my everything.

33:11.642 --> 33:12.868
Really?

33:14.436 --> 33:17.063
Because you mean nothing to me now.

33:32.746 --> 33:35.164
Hey, Paige, your car and a small army

33:35.165 --> 33:36.749
'of paparazzi are out front.'

33:36.750 --> 33:39.669
They can wait. Did you get my message?

33:39.670 --> 33:41.838
I want you to come to
the premiere with me.

33:41.839 --> 33:43.840
I, uh, picked out this dress for you.

33:43.841 --> 33:46.426
I-I thought it would look
really pretty with your eyes

33:46.427 --> 33:48.052
and we can have so much fun.

33:48.053 --> 33:49.554
We'll go somewhere after to talk

33:49.555 --> 33:50.972
and, you know, grab a milkshake...

33:50.973 --> 33:53.266
Paige, I'm not coming with you.

33:53.267 --> 33:54.475
Why?

33:54.476 --> 33:57.663
Because... I can't do this anymore.

33:58.397 --> 34:01.065
- I'm moving out.
- What?

34:01.066 --> 34:03.526
Look, so much of this is about me.

34:03.527 --> 34:07.530
My jealousy and my stuff that
I have to deal with, not you.

34:07.531 --> 34:10.199
But I have to do
something about it, Paige.

34:10.199 --> 34:13.328
But I don't understand, why,
why you have to move out?

34:13.329 --> 34:14.871
Because I can't keep feeling

34:14.871 --> 34:16.539
like I'm living my life in your shadow.

34:16.540 --> 34:17.706
You're not.

34:17.708 --> 34:19.626
Look, with Jake gone, it's different.

34:19.627 --> 34:21.585
You know, I, I can't just stay here

34:21.587 --> 34:24.005
feeling resentful of
you, it's not fair to you.

34:24.005 --> 34:26.257
But, Cassie, the whole
reason why we did this

34:26.257 --> 34:27.842
in the first place so that, was that

34:27.842 --> 34:29.636
we could do it together,
and you're right.

34:29.637 --> 34:31.888
Now, that Jake's gone, it..

34:31.889 --> 34:34.974
I-I-I don't want you to leave me too.

34:34.975 --> 34:37.518
Paige, please don't cry.
You're gonna ruin your make up.

34:37.518 --> 34:39.728
I don't care about the make up, Cassie.

34:39.730 --> 34:42.523
I care about you and
me and our friendship.

34:42.524 --> 34:45.025
Paige, you shouldn't stay here either.

34:45.027 --> 34:46.819
It's not safe for you anymore.

34:46.820 --> 34:49.906
I mean, you, you think this
paparazzi stuff is bad now?

34:49.907 --> 34:52.659
Just wait until the movie comes out.

34:52.659 --> 34:55.428
This is all just starting for you.

34:56.871 --> 34:58.915
You're moving on to this new world

34:58.916 --> 35:00.875
and Jake and I are not a part of it.

35:00.876 --> 35:02.752
No, that's-that's not true.

35:02.753 --> 35:04.656
It doesn't mean that
we're not gonna be friends.

35:04.657 --> 35:06.593
It just means that..

35:07.508 --> 35:11.761
...all this is... ending.

35:11.762 --> 35:12.971
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.

36:04.304 --> 36:06.739
Miss Townsen, this your
first red carpet premiere?

36:07.432 --> 36:08.932
Oh, yeah-yeah, technically.

36:08.933 --> 36:11.393
Well, don't worry.

36:11.394 --> 36:13.061
You're gonna be a real, big hit.

36:13.062 --> 36:15.832
'Just try to remember to
smile for all those cameras.'

36:16.316 --> 36:17.899
Will do.

36:17.900 --> 36:19.651
My name is Derek, by the way.

36:19.652 --> 36:22.155
I've been assigned by the studio
to be your driver from now on.

36:22.156 --> 36:24.156
Derek, nice to meet you. I'm Paige.

36:24.157 --> 36:28.535
Nice to meet you. And, and we're here.

36:28.536 --> 36:31.496
'Go knock 'em dead, Paige.'

36:58.066 --> 37:00.376
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:01.652 --> 37:03.653
You sure you're okay with this?

37:03.654 --> 37:05.197
Very sure about this.

37:05.198 --> 37:06.823
I've got a box of fruity pebbles

37:06.824 --> 37:09.534
and the "Gilmore Girls" standing by.

37:09.535 --> 37:11.345
Maybe we should watch something else.

37:11.954 --> 37:13.097
Come on.

37:17.168 --> 37:19.461
'We're live from famous
Gold Brothers Studios'

37:19.462 --> 37:20.962
in Hollywood, California.

37:20.963 --> 37:23.173
It's your favorite entertainment insider

37:23.174 --> 37:25.842
Barrett Hopper and we're
here for the world premiere

37:25.843 --> 37:29.012
of Golden Globe nominated
Jordan Wilder's new film

37:29.013 --> 37:30.597
"The Last Knockout."

37:30.598 --> 37:31.598
Paige!

37:34.268 --> 37:36.603
Waiting for your date?

37:36.604 --> 37:38.522
Which boy is that by the way?

37:38.523 --> 37:40.649
Rainer or Jake?

37:40.650 --> 37:42.275
You know I'm not dating either of them

37:42.276 --> 37:46.321
but since you're... prying, Rainer.

37:46.322 --> 37:48.545
You know, I'll admit when
things first started with Jake

37:48.546 --> 37:51.993
I had ulterior motives,
but then things changed.

37:51.994 --> 37:55.163
And I started having
real feelings for him.

37:55.164 --> 37:57.040
So, what I'm saying is maybe you and I

37:57.041 --> 37:58.667
are more like the new thing.

37:58.668 --> 38:01.378
Trust me, you and I..

38:01.379 --> 38:03.171
..we're nothing alike.

38:03.172 --> 38:04.840
You're right, I actually had the guts

38:04.841 --> 38:06.800
to tell Jake how I really felt.

38:08.761 --> 38:10.971
So, Jordan, how does it
feel to have your first

38:10.972 --> 38:13.849
Golden Globe nomination
and this new white hot film

38:13.850 --> 38:15.434
that's burning up the festival circuit?

38:15.435 --> 38:17.018
It feels pretty good, Jared.

38:17.019 --> 38:19.479
So, your career has basically
skyrocketed since nomination.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.982
Has there been any pressure at all?

38:21.983 --> 38:23.984
I'm just happy to be a part of it all.

38:23.985 --> 38:25.861
You know, a-and it's not about awards.

38:25.862 --> 38:27.279
For me it's about the work.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.281
So, tell me in "The Last Knockout"

38:29.282 --> 38:31.950
I heard you actually
trained with Manny Pacquiao?

38:35.246 --> 38:36.913
Wi-will you excuse me, please?

38:36.914 --> 38:38.558
Thanks for stopping by.

38:45.715 --> 38:46.882
Where are we going?

38:46.883 --> 38:48.609
I wanna talk to you in private.

38:51.387 --> 38:53.555
Look, I thought about what you said.

38:53.556 --> 38:57.392
And... I believe you.

38:57.393 --> 38:59.394
I know you're not proud
of that guy you used to be

38:59.395 --> 39:02.314
but, Jordan, I've known
you for a long time now.

39:02.315 --> 39:05.984
And you are not that same guy anymore.

39:08.738 --> 39:11.198
I wanna be with you.

39:11.199 --> 39:12.824
I love you.

39:12.825 --> 39:15.660
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:20.208 --> 39:21.666
Look, I know, okay.

39:21.667 --> 39:23.250
I know about everything that went down.

39:23.251 --> 39:25.420
I know that you and
Nina have been hiding it.

39:25.421 --> 39:27.923
- You know about that?
- Yeah.

39:27.924 --> 39:30.008
From the bottom of my heart

39:30.009 --> 39:31.176
that all that stuff is over.

39:31.177 --> 39:33.094
I know. I'm glad.

39:33.095 --> 39:36.473
I mean it. I've stopped
sleeping with Nina.

39:36.474 --> 39:38.868
- It's over. I promise.
- What?

39:40.686 --> 39:42.437
You and Nina?

39:45.983 --> 39:49.253
Don't you ever talk to me again, Jordan.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.161
Yeah, uh, it's-it's my
first red carpet premiere

39:58.162 --> 39:59.955
so I'm pretty nervous.

39:59.956 --> 40:02.499
Oh my God! I'm so nervous too.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.209
'Oh, my goodness.'

40:04.210 --> 40:06.753
'The talented and obviously very funny'

40:06.754 --> 40:08.088
Dan Fogler's with us here

40:08.089 --> 40:10.340
from "Fantastic Beats"
and "Where To Find Them."

40:10.341 --> 40:11.564
Uh, are you nervous right now?

40:11.565 --> 40:13.051
- I heard you're nervous.
- Uh, yeah.

40:13.052 --> 40:14.636
You wanna hear, like, a
special thing that I do

40:14.637 --> 40:16.596
um, when I get nervous
before these events?

40:16.597 --> 40:18.932
Well, yeah, you gotta tell
us. America wants to know.

40:18.933 --> 40:20.133
Okay, here's the secret thing.

40:20.134 --> 40:21.592
This is what I do. I go in the car.

40:21.593 --> 40:24.104
And I take like five or six really big

40:24.105 --> 40:26.398
thick, like, juicy bong hits, you know.

40:26.399 --> 40:29.418
And that just, like,
really takes the edge off.

40:31.862 --> 40:34.656
- Do you?
- No.

40:34.657 --> 40:37.867
Oh, my goodness.

40:37.868 --> 40:41.705
Well, see now, you're laughing,
and I'm not nervous anymore.

40:41.706 --> 40:42.956
Hey, I know you.

40:42.957 --> 40:45.458
Oh, my God, it's Ryan Phillippe.

40:45.459 --> 40:47.210
What's up, buddy? It's been a while.

40:47.211 --> 40:49.462
Don't listen to a word he says.

40:49.463 --> 40:51.256
- She's too young for you.
- What?

40:51.257 --> 40:52.760
I'll see you guys at the after party.

40:52.761 --> 40:54.259
- Okay.
- 'Okay.'

40:54.260 --> 40:55.486
Okay.

40:58.264 --> 41:00.432
Rainer! Rainer, this
way. Rainer, right here.

41:00.433 --> 41:02.350
- Rainer!
- Rainer, come over here.

41:02.351 --> 41:04.014
- Over here, man.
- Rainer, this way, man.

41:04.015 --> 41:06.271
- 'Rainer! Rainer!'
- 'Rainer, big smile.'

41:06.272 --> 41:07.397
Hey, how are you?

41:07.398 --> 41:09.524
Hey, Rainer, did you
dump Tangey for Paige?

41:09.525 --> 41:11.985
What are you doing? We're
not supposed to do this.

41:11.986 --> 41:13.486
I don't care.

41:16.073 --> 41:18.617
- Come on, do it again.
- Have you been drinking?

41:18.618 --> 41:21.328
- Rainer, are you off the wagon?
- Are you drunk, Rainer?

41:21.329 --> 41:23.204
Come on, let's go, let's go inside.

41:23.205 --> 41:26.207
What kind of guy shows up to his
best friend's premiere wasted?

41:26.208 --> 41:27.542
- Screw you, pal.
- Come on.

41:27.543 --> 41:28.894
Go to rehab, you loser.

41:30.212 --> 41:32.106
Rainer!

41:33.966 --> 41:35.133
Rainer!

41:36.802 --> 41:38.678
We're live at the Gold Brothers Studios

41:38.679 --> 41:42.641
where Rainer Devon has
literally lost his mind.

41:42.642 --> 41:44.493
Rainer, get off of him.

41:47.188 --> 41:49.689
Excuse me. Oh, easy, Rainer! Rainer!

41:49.690 --> 41:50.857
You're a liar too.

41:51.942 --> 41:53.193
Oh, my God.

41:53.194 --> 41:55.445
Rainer Devon has punched
out the head of the studio.

41:55.446 --> 41:57.447
This is beautiful.

41:57.448 --> 41:59.532
That is an epic meltdown.

41:59.533 --> 42:02.369
Oh, my God. I feel so bad for Paige.
